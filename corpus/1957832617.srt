1
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:57,150
Damn it all to hell.
What are you doing here?

2
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:58,452
It's raining.

3
00:01:58,485 --> 00:01:59,721
Of course it's raining.

4
00:01:59,754 --> 00:02:02,155
It's been raining every day
for a week.

5
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,658
Do you have them then?

6
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:06,360
I do.
Good.

7
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:14,936
Pay me.

8
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,336
In good time.

9
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,507
Not in good time.
Pay me now.

10
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,709
Oh, so that's how it is,
huh?

11
00:02:21,743 --> 00:02:23,678
I dirty my hands for you
and, you what?

12
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:25,479
You slit my throat?

13
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:29,550
Don't open it here, it'll stink.

14
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:32,419
Something that men like you
and I should be used to.

15
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:37,290
What happened to your leg?

16
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,826
God.

17
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,696
What?
God happened.

18
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:43,598
Indeed.

19
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:46,366
Sometimes we pay for our sins
even before we die.

20
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,201
You might want
to think on that.

21
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:51,773
I might.

22
00:02:53,608 --> 00:02:55,275
But I don't.

23
00:02:58,913 --> 00:03:02,517
God watch over you,
doctor.

24
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,552
What an archaic notion.

25
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:51,052
Hey, what's this then?

26
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:53,855
You, get out of there.

27
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:55,122
I know you can hear me.

28
00:05:55,156 --> 00:05:57,625
I said, "Get out."
Go ahead.

29
00:05:57,658 --> 00:05:59,660
Do us both a favor
and get your ass out of here.

30
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:01,461
Let me be

31
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,497
Don't shout at me.
This is my damned boneyard.

32
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:06,067
Please,
let me die in peace.

33
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,468
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.

34
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:10,004
This place
is not for the dying.

35
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,806
It's for the dead.
I'm begging you.

36
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,608
I'm sorry.
You have to get out.

37
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:15,176
Please!

38
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:18,579
Oh, none of that!

39
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:24,585
All I want is to die.

40
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:29,489
My whole wretched life,
that is all anyone wished on me.

41
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:34,528
And now,
now I am stopped?

42
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:54,782
Please.
No, not that.

43
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:56,017
Keep me safe.
Keep me safe.

44
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,153
What are you doing?
Keep me safe.

45
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:00,788
I won't hurt you.

46
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:01,956
Oh, my lord.

47
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:04,959
Listen to me.
I said I won't hurt you.

48
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:06,560
Oh, please protect me.

49
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:14,969
You need some help?

50
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,473
No one can help me.

51
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:21,776
Perhaps I can help you.

52
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:22,944
Why?

53
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:25,112
I used to help people.

54
00:07:25,146 --> 00:07:27,114
Why?
It's what people do.

55
00:07:27,148 --> 00:07:28,616
No, it isn't.

56
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:31,218
Well, it's what
we're supposed to do.

57
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:32,586
You come with me.

58
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:36,223
Where?

59
00:07:36,257 --> 00:07:38,693
I have a shack over beyond
the mausoleum.

60
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:41,128
Besides,
it's going to rain.

61
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:42,830
I'll go with you.

62
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:51,471
There it is.

63
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:57,578
It's small.

64
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:59,647
Well, I was going to take you
to my mansion,

65
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,150
but I prefer my dingy shack
with all of its rustic charm.

66
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:06,887
That was a joke.

67
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:09,690
I do not
understand jokes.

68
00:08:09,724 --> 00:08:11,192
I see.

69
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:19,734
Hmm?

70
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:21,268
No.

71
00:08:34,215 --> 00:08:37,852
Well, you don't have to just
stand there, do you?

72
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,103
Who is that?
Your father?

73
00:08:56,137 --> 00:08:58,172
Father of us all,
perhaps.

74
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,306
St. Anthony.

75
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,609
Your father was a saint?

76
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:04,612
No, but old Anthony up there
is the patron saint

77
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:07,281
of many things,
including gravediggers.

78
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:14,155
You're not one for conversation,
are you?

79
00:09:14,188 --> 00:09:15,856
No.

80
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:20,661
What's your name?

81
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,596
I have none.

82
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,265
You don't remember
your name?

83
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:26,133
I was never given one
to remember.

84
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:28,235
You're putting me on.

85
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:29,603
No.

86
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:32,173
What do people
call you then?

87
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:35,342
What the hell am I supposed
to call you, huh?

88
00:09:35,376 --> 00:09:36,944
Just pick a name,
will you?

89
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:40,114
Something you like.
Anything.

90
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:41,649
I don't know many names,

91
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:43,951
and the ones I know
I don't want.

92
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:48,989
Alright then, Helga.

93
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,225
What?
That's your new name.

94
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,993
No.
What's wrong with Helga?

95
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:54,762
It's a fine Bavarian name.

96
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:56,831
It's a woman's name.

97
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:59,667
I thought you didn't know
many names.

98
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,369
Don't mock me.
Alright then.

99
00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:05,973
How about Ingrid,
or Eva, or --

100
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:08,209
Do not mock me.

101
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:10,311
Pick a name, damn it!

102
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,982
You raised
your voice at me.

103
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:17,251
You raised yours first.

104
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,854
Aren't you afraid of me?

105
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:22,756
I am,
but I'm also in my cups.

106
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,894
Means I can do stupid things
even when I'm scared.

107
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:29,029
You are a strange man.

108
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:30,798
What does that
make you then?

109
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,703
Just strange.

110
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,211
Anton.

111
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:45,746
What's that?

112
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,449
You can call me Anton,
like your saint.

113
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,784
Anton it is then.

114
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:52,686
I'm Kurt Volker.

115
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:01,095
[ Screams

116
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:02,263
Good Christ.

117
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:03,931
Did I hurt you?
Yes.

118
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:05,966
This is my drinking hand,
too.

119
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,801
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

120
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:10,237
I'm just alright.
Just give me a minute.

121
00:11:13,207 --> 00:11:16,377
God. Oh.

122
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,312
Oh.

123
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,281
Quite the ox, huh?

124
00:11:20,314 --> 00:11:22,750
I am strong if that
is what you mean.

125
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,118
Ah.
Good for you.

126
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,387
The world always needs
strong men.

127
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,023
Hmm.

128
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:30,124
Here.

129
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:31,825
To keep you warm.

130
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:43,505
So, Anton the Ox, what brings
you to my boneyard?

131
00:11:43,538 --> 00:11:47,141
Not many folks find themselves
here accidentally.

132
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:51,312
They're either the mourners
or the ones being mourned.

133
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:53,447
I was drawn here.

134
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,848
Really?

135
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:57,151
This place feels
familiar to me.

136
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,086
You've been here
before then?
Perhaps.

137
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:01,155
Have I put one of yours
in the ground here?

138
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:03,290
Your mother, your father?

139
00:12:03,324 --> 00:12:05,025
Why do you limp?

140
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:06,794
Beg pardon?
You walk with a limp.

141
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:07,895
I want to know why.

142
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:09,129
I don't see how --
Are you damaged?

143
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:10,898
I don't want
to talk about it.

144
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,166
I'm just asking what --

145
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,001
And I'm telling you
leave it alone.

146
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:15,803
Just because
I show pity on you

147
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:19,273
doesn't mean I want to tell you
my goddamn life story.

148
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:26,914
Do you have any family
near abouts?

149
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:28,949
Someone to take you in.

150
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:32,019
I have a father,
but he won't claim me.

151
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,921
Bastard?

152
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:35,189
I've been called that.

153
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:37,525
Ah.
You and I both.

154
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:44,064
It's no palace, but you can
sleep here tonight if you want.

155
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:46,000
Least you'll stay dry.

156
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:48,269
Then tomorrow you can go
wherever you're going.

157
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:50,437
I'm not going anywhere.

158
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:52,406
I was trying to die.

159
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,109
Well, you can't do that here.
I won't let you.

160
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:58,112
If I decided to,
you couldn't stop me.

161
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:00,515
Oh, you're a tough one,
huh?

162
00:13:00,548 --> 00:13:02,216
You know I am.

163
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,221
What?

164
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:09,089
Put your arm up here
and show me.

165
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:10,224
I do not understand.

166
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:11,825
You've never
done this before?

167
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:14,395
I don't know.
Put your arm
up here like mine.

168
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:19,366
Now, you try to push
my arm down.

169
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,568
I'll try
to push yours down.

170
00:13:20,602 --> 00:13:22,537
Whoever does it wins.

171
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,305
This is childish.

172
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:27,074
Oh, let's see how strong you
are when I know what's coming.

173
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:30,010
I don't know I ---
Don't let my limp fool you.

174
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:31,546
I've got muscles that --

175
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:34,848
Oh.
Jesus Christ.

176
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:36,083
I win.

177
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:37,951
But I wasn't even really,
damn it.

178
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,054
Yes, but I won.

179
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:41,523
Again.
We're going again.

180
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:50,264
This time don't move
until I so, huh?

181
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:51,566
On the count of three.

182
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:53,200
One.

183
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,435
Oh, damn it.

184
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:55,869
Are we going again?

185
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:57,071
God.

186
00:13:57,104 --> 00:14:00,307
Come on.

187
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:01,442
I win again.

188
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:03,010
Sweet merciful Christ.

189
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:05,012
I've never seen anything
like that.

190
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,113
Shall we go again?

191
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:07,582
No, no, no, no.

192
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,651
If there's one thing that life
has taught me over

193
00:14:09,684 --> 00:14:12,587
and over again,
to know when I've been beat.

194
00:14:19,594 --> 00:14:22,496
You're with the circus,
aren't you?

195
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:25,065
What?
Strong man or something?

196
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,605
Pulling nails out of boards
with your bare teeth?

197
00:14:30,638 --> 00:14:32,239
Bending iron bars in two?

198
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:34,274
I have never even
seen a circus.

199
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:35,577
You should seek one out.

200
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,445
They'd welcome you,
no doubt.

201
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:42,216
I don't do well in company
of others.

202
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:44,318
We're getting along fine.

203
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:46,286
Hmm.

204
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,455
Is it your face?
Trust me.

205
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:50,991
A circus wouldn't care
about that.

206
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:52,459
They might love it,
in fact.

207
00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:54,928
I don't like
being stared at.

208
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:57,297
Might want to consider
unwrapping yourself.

209
00:14:57,331 --> 00:14:59,199
Draws a lot of attention.

210
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:02,236
Draws more attention
without the bandages.

211
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:03,937
Can't be that bad.

212
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:06,674
That bad and worse.

213
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:08,308
Do you mind if I ask?

214
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:10,344
Ask what?
About your face?

215
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:11,579
Was it an accident?

216
00:15:11,613 --> 00:15:13,947
I know a man works
at a university.

217
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:15,583
Knocked over
a beaker of acid,

218
00:15:15,617 --> 00:15:17,585
damn near melted
his whole left side.

219
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:19,052
It was no acid.

220
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,220
Poor fellow looked
like a --

221
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,356
I do not wish
to discuss it.

222
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,659
I was just asking.
I --

223
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:26,126
I'll tell you
about my face

224
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,696
when you tell me
about your limp.

225
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,498
Fair enough.

226
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:35,469
Well, Anton the Ox,
I'm off to bed.

227
00:15:35,503 --> 00:15:37,204
That's the only one I've got,

228
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:40,307
but I've got this spare room
here where I keep my tools.

229
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,309
There's some hay bales
that will serve as a bed.

230
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:43,745
It's yours
if you want it.

231
00:15:43,778 --> 00:15:45,245
I should leave.

232
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,681
And go where?

233
00:15:46,714 --> 00:15:49,517
Wherever I go,
tragedy follows.

234
00:15:49,551 --> 00:15:52,319
Tragedy and I have known
each other a long time.

235
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:55,189
I don't fear it
and neither should you.

236
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:58,425
Besides the downpour
is still going strong.

237
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:02,396
Ah, do what you want.

238
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:05,365
I'd say not to steal anything,
but I have nothing worth taking.

239
00:16:10,705 --> 00:16:12,574
You're welcome.

240
00:17:01,623 --> 00:17:03,423
What are you doing?

241
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:06,159
Stay back.
Stay back.

242
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:08,328
What are you doing here?

243
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:12,266
Another step and I'll slit
your throat for you.

244
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:13,400
Put your knife down.

245
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:14,736
Think of
worth is.

246
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:16,504
Put it down or I'll break
your arm, woman.

247
00:17:16,538 --> 00:17:18,506
Don't touch me.

248
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,073
I won't.
Good.

249
00:17:22,577 --> 00:17:24,177
I didn't hear you
come up on me.

250
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,446
I didn't wish to be heard,
so I wasn't.

251
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,215
Simple as that?

252
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:30,117
The only thought
I put into it.

253
00:17:34,622 --> 00:17:36,591
What?
What?

254
00:17:36,624 --> 00:17:39,594
I did not know
what you said.

255
00:17:39,627 --> 00:17:43,163
It loses something
in translation.

256
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:44,398
What are you doing here?

257
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:46,433
I could ask you
the same question.

258
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:49,804
I could break your neck
and take your sack from you.

259
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:53,307
Not one for social graces,
are you?

260
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,776
No.

261
00:17:56,778 --> 00:17:58,278
You're the gravedigger?

262
00:17:58,312 --> 00:17:59,647
Is that it?

263
00:17:59,681 --> 00:18:03,751
A loyal dog
guarding his hole.

264
00:18:03,785 --> 00:18:05,485
I am Anton.

265
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,623
You are certain?

266
00:18:08,656 --> 00:18:10,825
I was just recently named.

267
00:18:10,858 --> 00:18:14,461
It does not sound
like my own yet.

268
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:16,531
I do not understand
what that means.

269
00:18:16,564 --> 00:18:18,600
I don't know how else
to explain it.

270
00:18:24,872 --> 00:18:27,474
I like your smile.

271
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:29,242
Oh, yes.

272
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,913
You have a lovely face.

273
00:18:31,946 --> 00:18:33,881
So I've been told.

274
00:18:33,915 --> 00:18:36,551
What is your name?

275
00:18:36,584 --> 00:18:38,519
Nadya.

276
00:18:38,553 --> 00:18:40,487
Nadya.

277
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:42,557
That's it.

278
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:45,660
What is in your bag,
Nadya?

279
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:47,528
Bones.

280
00:18:47,562 --> 00:18:49,396
Why would you have a bag
of bones?

281
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:50,798
Why do you think?

282
00:18:50,832 --> 00:18:52,466
I don't know.
That's why I asked.

283
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:54,736
I'm Romani.

284
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:55,903
Gypsy.

285
00:18:55,937 --> 00:18:57,672
That's right.

286
00:18:57,705 --> 00:19:00,775
I use these
to see the future.

287
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:02,844
You're lying.
Don't call me a liar.

288
00:19:02,877 --> 00:19:04,812
No one
can see the future.

289
00:19:04,846 --> 00:19:07,381
A long list of clientele
would say otherwise.

290
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:10,250
I do not believe
in superstition.

291
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:11,719
Then what?

292
00:19:11,753 --> 00:19:13,186
Science.

293
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,354
I believe in science.

294
00:19:14,388 --> 00:19:16,189
Oh,
they're so different?

295
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:18,559
If we're going to have a chat,
sit down already.

296
00:19:20,762 --> 00:19:25,566
The ground is wet
from the rain.

297
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:32,573
I'm funny to you?

298
00:19:32,607 --> 00:19:35,610
Yes.
Your bottom is wet.

299
00:19:35,643 --> 00:19:37,679
Thank you.
I'm well aware.

300
00:19:37,712 --> 00:19:40,748
You knew it had rained,
but you sat down anyway.

301
00:19:40,782 --> 00:19:41,816
That was foolish.

302
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:43,718
I wasn't thinking.

303
00:19:43,751 --> 00:19:46,319
You behaved foolishly.

304
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,890
Are you quite finished?

305
00:19:48,923 --> 00:19:52,994
And now
your bottom is wet.

306
00:19:53,027 --> 00:19:56,363
You're a strange giant.

307
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:57,999
I have never
laughed before.

308
00:19:58,032 --> 00:20:00,267
Not that I can remember.

309
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,436
Nonsense.
It's true.

310
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:04,438
I am younger
than I look.

311
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:06,641
I can't tell
how you look right --
Don't.

312
00:20:06,674 --> 00:20:09,476
It's so terrifying?
Do not touch me.

313
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,946
Not something
I'm often told.

314
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:14,882
Why would you want to?
To see your face.

315
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,951
I'm always curious.

316
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:18,452
The more something is hidden,
the more

317
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:20,855
I want to take it
out of the shadows.

318
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:24,257
I belong where no one
can see me.

319
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,359
That makes me want to...

320
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:27,795
Oh!

321
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:29,964
...and look.

322
00:20:29,997 --> 00:20:31,599
Now we're touching.

323
00:20:31,632 --> 00:20:32,633
Don't.
Not so bad, is it?

324
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:33,701
Don't.
Don't what?

325
00:20:33,735 --> 00:20:34,736
Do not touch my face.

326
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:37,304
I haven't.
And I won't.

327
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:38,673
But before you wanted
to see it and --

328
00:20:38,706 --> 00:20:41,909
I will only see it
when you let me, not before.

329
00:20:41,943 --> 00:20:44,045
I will never want that.

330
00:20:44,078 --> 00:20:46,013
I can be
very persuasive.

331
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:51,853
Since I have provided
this evenings entertainment,

332
00:20:51,886 --> 00:20:53,821
perhaps you'll let me
leave with my bag

333
00:20:53,855 --> 00:20:55,890
and with my limbs intact.

334
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:57,058
I won't hurt you.

335
00:20:57,091 --> 00:20:58,793
I wouldn't have let you
if you tried.

336
00:20:58,826 --> 00:21:01,729
I want you to stay.

337
00:21:01,763 --> 00:21:03,064
That's sweet,
but I'm not staying in this

338
00:21:03,097 --> 00:21:04,799
graveyard all night.

339
00:21:04,832 --> 00:21:07,869
Lots of Strigoi
about.

340
00:21:07,902 --> 00:21:10,403
Evil spirits.

341
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:14,008
You like to use words
I don't know.

342
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,710
That makes you feel smart.

343
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:20,748
You're a clever.

344
00:21:20,782 --> 00:21:22,650
Until next time, Anton.

345
00:21:22,683 --> 00:21:25,418
So, you'll return?

346
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:27,420
Yes, I think I will.

347
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:31,626
And, are we friends?

348
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:33,861
Stranger things
have happened.

349
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:56,416
Back to the circus
with you, huh?

350
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:08,428
Yours is not the ideal face
to wake up to.

351
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:09,697
I want to stay.

352
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,498
What?
I want to stay.

353
00:22:11,532 --> 00:22:13,466
I heard you,
you damn lummox.

354
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,735
Will you just get inside?

355
00:22:16,671 --> 00:22:18,371
If your offer
still stands,

356
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:19,740
I would like to stay here
with you.

357
00:22:19,774 --> 00:22:21,709
If my...
What the hell?

358
00:22:21,742 --> 00:22:22,977
You offered me
the tool room.

359
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,411
For one damn night.

360
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:25,646
I wish to stay longer.

361
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,815
Well,
I wish for a buxom lady

362
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:29,650
with a stein
between her breasts.

363
00:22:29,684 --> 00:22:31,986
Mine is a life
of disappointment.

364
00:22:34,922 --> 00:22:37,925
And now I remember
you don't understand jokes.

365
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:44,364
The gypsy sat on wet dirt
and got her bottom wet.

366
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:48,401
I don't get it.

367
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:51,471
It was a joke.
I still don't get it.

368
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:52,907
It made me laugh.

369
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,145
So, you want to stay,
huh?

370
00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:00,147
Yes.
Why?

371
00:23:00,181 --> 00:23:02,183
I have nowhere
else to go.

372
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:05,418
I came here to die,
but I no longer wish to that.

373
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:06,621
And I like it here.

374
00:23:06,654 --> 00:23:08,455
You like the graveyard?

375
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:09,757
It's peaceful.

376
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:12,492
I have known very little peace
in my life.

377
00:23:12,526 --> 00:23:15,495
I like the quiet myself.

378
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:16,831
So, I can stay?

379
00:23:16,864 --> 00:23:18,633
Just give me a moment,
will you?

380
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:20,835
I'm barely awake and...

381
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:23,104
You have no money, no prospects.
And I should what?

382
00:23:23,137 --> 00:23:24,872
Give up my peace and quiet
for a boarder?

383
00:23:24,906 --> 00:23:27,008
I don't even know you.

384
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:28,475
I don't know you either.

385
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:29,844
That's hardly the point,
is it?

386
00:23:29,877 --> 00:23:31,012
Is it?

387
00:23:31,045 --> 00:23:32,914
Every time
you open your mouth

388
00:23:32,947 --> 00:23:35,683
I don't know whether to laugh
or to punch you.

389
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:40,621
You helped me before,
why won't you help me now?

390
00:23:40,655 --> 00:23:41,756
It's not so simple.

391
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:43,224
Explain it to me.
I can't.

392
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:45,192
- I want to understand.
- stop talking.

393
00:23:45,226 --> 00:23:47,528
And will you just shut
your flapping jaws

394
00:23:47,561 --> 00:23:49,530
for a?

395
00:23:52,499 --> 00:23:55,069
I've been alone
for a long while here.

396
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:57,571
It's the way I prefer it.

397
00:23:57,605 --> 00:24:00,174
When other people are around,
it complicates things.

398
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:02,475
I don't like complications.

399
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,477
I am a complication?

400
00:24:04,512 --> 00:24:07,214
Yes.
I'm sorry, but yes.

401
00:24:07,248 --> 00:24:10,483
So, you do not like me?

402
00:24:10,518 --> 00:24:13,020
No,
that's not what I said.

403
00:24:13,054 --> 00:24:14,622
You're alright,
I guess.

404
00:24:14,655 --> 00:24:17,224
You either talk too much
or too little, but yes,

405
00:24:17,258 --> 00:24:19,727
I've definitely
known worse than you.

406
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,896
Well, thank you.

407
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:23,264
I just...

408
00:24:23,297 --> 00:24:25,266
I'm a drunk
and crippled ass.

409
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:27,535
I'm not
a good companion.

410
00:24:27,568 --> 00:24:28,936
I like you.

411
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,805
You're the only person who has
ever shown me kindness

412
00:24:30,838 --> 00:24:32,707
in my entire life.

413
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,509
Well,
I'm sorry to hear that.

414
00:24:42,817 --> 00:24:44,118
I tell you a secret.

415
00:24:46,287 --> 00:24:47,822
Alright.

416
00:24:47,855 --> 00:24:50,725
I'm a hair's breath
from losing this job.

417
00:24:50,758 --> 00:24:53,260
Really?
I can't dig
for shit anymore.

418
00:24:53,294 --> 00:24:56,263
I have a hard enough time
getting around with this leg.

419
00:24:56,297 --> 00:24:58,833
The church, they keep me on
as a kindness,

420
00:24:58,866 --> 00:25:01,235
but that can hardly
keep up anymore.

421
00:25:01,268 --> 00:25:04,638
People drop like flies in this
town as they can't afford

422
00:25:04,672 --> 00:25:07,908
to hire another man to help,
so there it is.

423
00:25:14,315 --> 00:25:16,550
I can dig for you.

424
00:25:16,584 --> 00:25:18,052
Yes, you can.

425
00:25:18,085 --> 00:25:19,620
I am stronger
than anyone.

426
00:25:19,653 --> 00:25:21,155
I can dig many graves.

427
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:22,289
At night.

428
00:25:22,323 --> 00:25:24,325
You'll dig at night and stay
in the shack during the day.

429
00:25:24,358 --> 00:25:26,160
That way no one will know.

430
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:28,129
That works for me.

431
00:25:28,162 --> 00:25:30,731
I have no desire
drawing attention to myself.

432
00:25:30,765 --> 00:25:33,701
I won't be able to pay you,
but you can stay here

433
00:25:33,734 --> 00:25:36,037
and I will share
my meals with you.

434
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,973
That's all I ask.

435
00:25:39,006 --> 00:25:41,609
Alright, then.

436
00:25:41,642 --> 00:25:42,743
You're helping me again.

437
00:25:42,777 --> 00:25:44,078
No, I'm helping myself.

438
00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:45,846
You just happen
to be here.

439
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,281
I think
it's more than that.

440
00:25:47,314 --> 00:25:49,617
It's not.
I think it is.

441
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,852
Shut your gum
before I change my mind.

442
00:25:51,886 --> 00:25:53,287
Thank you.

443
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,190
Don't thank me,
this is entirely self-serving.

444
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:57,925
You're a good man.

445
00:25:57,958 --> 00:26:00,561
And you are one sentence away
from fouling the deal.

446
00:26:06,801 --> 00:26:09,303
Ah.
Gentle this time.

447
00:26:09,336 --> 00:26:13,040
I like my knuckles lined up
the way they are.

448
00:26:13,074 --> 00:26:14,909
Alright.
Alright.

449
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:32,760
It's large enough
for a casket, yes?

450
00:26:32,793 --> 00:26:34,929
It's large enough
fat Burgomeister

451
00:26:34,962 --> 00:26:36,730
and half his fat family.

452
00:26:36,764 --> 00:26:38,232
So, you're satisfied?

453
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:40,634
Stunned is more like it,
but yes.

454
00:26:40,668 --> 00:26:42,069
Yes.
Well done.

455
00:26:42,103 --> 00:26:44,672
And that took you
not even an hour

456
00:26:44,705 --> 00:26:46,707
and I don't see
one drop of sweat.

457
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,642
That was not
difficult work.

458
00:26:48,676 --> 00:26:50,211
How could you say that?

459
00:26:50,244 --> 00:26:53,347
In my prime, this hole would
have taken me half the night.

460
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,217
Your prime and mine
are two different things.

461
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,985
That is God's truth.

462
00:27:01,188 --> 00:27:02,656
Not bad.

463
00:27:08,729 --> 00:27:10,731
You may not need it,
but you deserve it.

464
00:27:19,874 --> 00:27:22,376
Not the whole
damn thing.

465
00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:24,778
I'm sorry.

466
00:27:34,889 --> 00:27:37,057
No harm done.

467
00:27:37,091 --> 00:27:40,895
It -- It...
What is it?

468
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,329
Schnapps.

469
00:27:44,231 --> 00:27:45,799
I like it.

470
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:48,435
If it's one thing we Bavarian's
know, it's schnapps.

471
00:27:54,975 --> 00:27:56,443
Where are you from,
Anton?

472
00:27:56,477 --> 00:27:58,946
Many places, I suppose.

473
00:27:58,979 --> 00:28:01,081
I think I was born
in Ingolstadt,

474
00:28:01,115 --> 00:28:03,918
but most of my life
was spent in Switzerland.

475
00:28:03,951 --> 00:28:06,320
An orphan?

476
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:08,022
Abandoned.

477
00:28:08,055 --> 00:28:10,891
My father saw my face
and left me.

478
00:28:10,925 --> 00:28:13,260
Christ, I'm sorry
to hear that.

479
00:28:13,294 --> 00:28:17,164
I hate him
or I hated him.

480
00:28:17,198 --> 00:28:20,367
I can no longer
tell the difference.

481
00:28:20,401 --> 00:28:22,770
Oh, you've done well
for yourself.

482
00:28:22,803 --> 00:28:25,039
Got an education.

483
00:28:25,072 --> 00:28:26,974
Experience only.

484
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:28,475
Little of it good.

485
00:28:31,812 --> 00:28:33,147
Well, you speak proper.

486
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,182
I enjoy language.

487
00:28:35,216 --> 00:28:39,019
There was a time when I wasn't
capable to communicate at all.

488
00:28:39,053 --> 00:28:42,289
It was maddening to have
these feelings, these thoughts,

489
00:28:42,323 --> 00:28:46,260
and the urge to express them,
but not the ability to do so.

490
00:28:46,293 --> 00:28:48,929
For some that would be
an improvement.

491
00:28:48,963 --> 00:28:50,898
It must hurt.

492
00:28:50,931 --> 00:28:55,336
I imagine everything that lives
wants to be understood.

493
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:59,240
Anton, my friend
I will drink to that.

494
00:28:59,273 --> 00:29:00,508
I never had a friend.

495
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:02,343
Come now.

496
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:03,944
Truly.

497
00:29:03,978 --> 00:29:07,147
Those who didn't wish me
dead simply fled from me.

498
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:09,850
You're a hunted man, then?

499
00:29:09,883 --> 00:29:12,119
Once, but I fled
beyond their reach.

500
00:29:12,152 --> 00:29:14,788
A criminal.

501
00:29:14,822 --> 00:29:16,357
I've done terrible things.

502
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:18,526
I was young.

503
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,161
I had no control
over what I felt.

504
00:29:21,195 --> 00:29:22,896
I raged against those
who hurt me the most,

505
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,866
and some of them died
because of it.

506
00:29:32,006 --> 00:29:34,408
Ego te absolvo.

507
00:29:36,844 --> 00:29:39,480
I'm wet and confused.

508
00:29:39,514 --> 00:29:41,348
I just absolved you
of your sins.

509
00:29:41,382 --> 00:29:43,384
And I did it in Latin.

510
00:29:43,417 --> 00:29:45,452
You did?
Oh, yes.

511
00:29:45,486 --> 00:29:48,055
It's the language
God prefers his prayers in.

512
00:29:48,088 --> 00:29:50,958
Are you a priest?

513
00:29:50,991 --> 00:29:54,228
Well, Brother Anton,
I'm off to perform a miracle.

514
00:29:54,261 --> 00:29:56,463
Turning schnapps
into piss.

515
00:29:56,497 --> 00:29:58,832
Well, what should I do?

516
00:29:58,866 --> 00:30:01,068
Whatever you want.
This is your home now.

517
00:30:01,101 --> 00:30:02,870
I need guidance.

518
00:30:02,903 --> 00:30:05,339
Do you know what I do when
I'm in need of some thinking?

519
00:30:05,372 --> 00:30:08,242
No.
How could I know that?

520
00:30:08,275 --> 00:30:10,844
I walk amongst these graves,
read what little I can

521
00:30:10,878 --> 00:30:14,848
on the stones, learn about
some people this earth holds.

522
00:30:14,882 --> 00:30:17,318
What I suggest to you is that
you take your past,

523
00:30:17,351 --> 00:30:19,186
you bury it
in one of these plots,

524
00:30:19,219 --> 00:30:21,989
and then start thinking
of your future.

525
00:30:22,022 --> 00:30:25,359
I never thought of my future,
only where I was

526
00:30:25,392 --> 00:30:27,161
and what I felt
at that moment.

527
00:30:27,194 --> 00:30:30,130
To find
faith, you achieve nothing.

528
00:30:30,164 --> 00:30:31,899
You want to find happiness,
lummox,

529
00:30:31,932 --> 00:30:36,270
decide what you want your life
to be and make it so.

530
00:30:36,303 --> 00:30:39,973
Is that how you ended up
a grave digger?

531
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:42,610
That's a story
for another time.

532
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:59,493
Hello, Giant.

533
00:30:59,527 --> 00:31:01,663
Hello, Nadya.

534
00:31:01,696 --> 00:31:04,031
I'm sorry.
Please, don't.

535
00:31:04,064 --> 00:31:08,102
If I was meant to fly,
I'd have a beak and feathers.

536
00:31:08,135 --> 00:31:09,937
Chickens have beaks
and feathers.

537
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,372
They cannot fly.

538
00:31:11,405 --> 00:31:12,607
Yes, they do.

539
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,274
I don't think so.

540
00:31:14,308 --> 00:31:16,477
Chickens fly, Anton.

541
00:31:16,511 --> 00:31:18,580
I have never
seen them do so.

542
00:31:18,613 --> 00:31:21,281
I have met many strange men
in my day,

543
00:31:21,315 --> 00:31:23,984
but you may very well
be the strangest.

544
00:31:24,017 --> 00:31:26,253
You do not need
to insult me.

545
00:31:26,286 --> 00:31:28,355
Not an insult.

546
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:32,259
Strange means interesting.

547
00:31:32,292 --> 00:31:36,063
Very, very, very few men
are interesting anymore.

548
00:31:36,096 --> 00:31:38,365
Oh, thank you.

549
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,468
Bentru Putin.

550
00:31:41,503 --> 00:31:44,606
Are you here
for more bones?

551
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:46,306
Not this time.

552
00:31:53,046 --> 00:31:54,448
Dirt?

553
00:31:54,481 --> 00:31:56,216
Grave dirt.

554
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:59,086
Very potent.

555
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:01,054
How can dirt be potent?

556
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:03,957
Good for seeing the past
and the future.

557
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:06,093
I have new client,
wants to see his future.

558
00:32:06,126 --> 00:32:08,328
So I asked him
a few questions,

559
00:32:08,362 --> 00:32:12,099
and he mentioned
this graveyard several times.

560
00:32:12,132 --> 00:32:16,270
So we'll take the dirt, mix it
with wax, and make a candle.

561
00:32:17,739 --> 00:32:19,507
To see the future?

562
00:32:19,541 --> 00:32:21,041
Yes.

563
00:32:21,074 --> 00:32:22,309
With a candle?

564
00:32:22,342 --> 00:32:24,378
Yes.

565
00:32:24,411 --> 00:32:26,514
You are as strange
as I am.

566
00:32:26,548 --> 00:32:28,248
What I am is penniless.

567
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:31,318
I'll take whatever clienti
I can get.

568
00:32:31,351 --> 00:32:35,557
So, this month has been good
to you, yes?

569
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,990
What?

570
00:32:37,024 --> 00:32:39,393
You're looking less ragged.

571
00:32:39,426 --> 00:32:41,295
I do not understand.

572
00:32:41,328 --> 00:32:45,499
Those clothes, better than the
scraps you were wearing before.

573
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:47,301
I took them off
a dead man.

574
00:32:50,572 --> 00:32:53,675
He did not need
them anymore.

575
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:56,009
My thought as well.

576
00:32:56,043 --> 00:32:57,679
We have something
in common.

577
00:32:57,712 --> 00:33:02,449
We are both of us, corbi,
picking off the dead.

578
00:33:02,483 --> 00:33:06,453
You mean crows.

579
00:33:06,487 --> 00:33:08,790
Very good, giant.

580
00:33:08,823 --> 00:33:12,292
You have learned
some of my language.

581
00:33:12,326 --> 00:33:14,194
I was hoping
to see you again.

582
00:33:14,228 --> 00:33:17,164
You were hoping
to impress me, yes?

583
00:33:17,197 --> 00:33:20,033
I have a favor
to ask of you.

584
00:33:20,067 --> 00:33:21,803
Ah, yes.

585
00:33:21,836 --> 00:33:23,671
What might that be?

586
00:33:23,705 --> 00:33:25,472
I want to know
my future.

587
00:33:25,507 --> 00:33:28,610
Is that all?

588
00:33:28,643 --> 00:33:30,410
Should I ask more?

589
00:33:30,444 --> 00:33:33,615
You should always ask
for what you want,

590
00:33:33,648 --> 00:33:35,683
be prepared
not to get it.

591
00:33:35,717 --> 00:33:40,420
My entire life I learned to
expect nothing from anybody.

592
00:33:41,421 --> 00:33:45,025
And yet here you stand
with a set of new clothes.

593
00:33:47,427 --> 00:33:49,363
You have a point.

594
00:33:49,396 --> 00:33:53,835
So, what of your future
do you wish to know?

595
00:33:53,868 --> 00:33:55,637
Anything, everything.

596
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:59,574
Those are two
very different answers.

597
00:33:59,607 --> 00:34:01,441
I never thought of my future.

598
00:34:01,475 --> 00:34:04,746
In fact, I doubted I would live
this long and, but now --

599
00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:06,413
Now your life
has changed?

600
00:34:06,446 --> 00:34:08,181
Yes.

601
00:34:08,215 --> 00:34:10,083
For the better?

602
00:34:10,117 --> 00:34:12,854
I think so.
I hope so.

603
00:34:12,887 --> 00:34:16,591
You wish to know if this
better life will last?

604
00:34:16,624 --> 00:34:17,759
Very much.

605
00:34:19,694 --> 00:34:21,328
Sit with me.

606
00:34:33,173 --> 00:34:36,243
Why do you hide
your face?

607
00:34:36,276 --> 00:34:37,344
I have no face.

608
00:34:37,377 --> 00:34:40,147
Well, you have eyes.

609
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:43,150
Yes, I'm made that way.

610
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,523
You have a mouth
and I'm guessing a nose.

611
00:34:50,223 --> 00:34:53,728
But together
they're monstrous.

612
00:34:53,761 --> 00:34:55,563
I'm sorry.

613
00:34:55,597 --> 00:34:57,632
I always
looked like that.

614
00:34:57,665 --> 00:35:01,401
This place is the first place
nobody runs from me.

615
00:35:03,805 --> 00:35:07,240
It is why I like coming
to places like this.

616
00:35:07,274 --> 00:35:09,209
A sanctuary for outcasts.

617
00:35:12,914 --> 00:35:16,551
I'm so lovely you cannot help
but stare, is that it?

618
00:35:16,584 --> 00:35:20,588
You don't look
like an outcast.

619
00:35:20,622 --> 00:35:23,625
The gypsy,
we belong nowhere.

620
00:35:23,658 --> 00:35:25,760
You have tribes,
family, friends.

621
00:35:25,793 --> 00:35:27,862
I'm the last
of my people here.

622
00:35:27,895 --> 00:35:31,833
The others have moved on.

623
00:35:31,866 --> 00:35:34,167
You did not go with them?

624
00:35:34,201 --> 00:35:36,638
I couldn't.
They cast me out.

625
00:35:36,671 --> 00:35:39,373
Why?

626
00:35:39,406 --> 00:35:41,643
Hurts to tell it.

627
00:35:41,676 --> 00:35:42,877
I understand.

628
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:46,179
You couldn't,
it didn't happen to you.

629
00:35:46,213 --> 00:35:50,852
My little life I had, I lost
and I carry that loss with me

630
00:35:50,885 --> 00:35:53,655
everywhere I go.

631
00:35:53,688 --> 00:35:57,257
Is that where your kindness
comes from?

632
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,726
Am I kind?

633
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,695
Very.

634
00:36:00,728 --> 00:36:03,665
You have a child's heart.

635
00:36:03,698 --> 00:36:07,568
It gives itself completely

636
00:36:07,602 --> 00:36:09,904
and shatters
at the smallest hurt.

637
00:36:12,406 --> 00:36:14,307
I wish
I was stronger inside.

638
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:16,678
You will be strong
or you will be dead.

639
00:36:16,711 --> 00:36:18,880
The world welcomes
no others.

640
00:36:18,913 --> 00:36:20,447
It is that cruel?

641
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,684
That cruel, and worse.

642
00:36:29,624 --> 00:36:32,426
I had a child.

643
00:36:32,459 --> 00:36:35,462
You seem too young.

644
00:36:35,495 --> 00:36:37,197
Not so young as all that.

645
00:36:39,466 --> 00:36:42,603
My child, my girl...

646
00:36:42,637 --> 00:36:45,840
she was incrucisat, mixed,

647
00:36:45,873 --> 00:36:49,744
her father was not my tribe,
not of any tribe.

648
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:54,615
That's why they sent
you away?

649
00:36:54,649 --> 00:36:56,349
Yes.

650
00:36:56,383 --> 00:36:58,385
With my people,
that is great shame.

651
00:36:58,418 --> 00:37:02,489
It cannot be washed away.

652
00:37:02,523 --> 00:37:04,324
So they cast me
to the winds.

653
00:37:06,493 --> 00:37:07,962
I'm sorry.

654
00:37:11,065 --> 00:37:14,267
I was young, a fool.

655
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:21,008
I went to the father,
he was man of numbers.

656
00:37:21,042 --> 00:37:25,412
How do call him a man
who counts money?

657
00:37:25,445 --> 00:37:27,314
A banker.
Banker, yes.

658
00:37:29,717 --> 00:37:34,622
He had come to my camp,
and I had loved him.

659
00:37:34,655 --> 00:37:38,526
But I loved him
with a child's heart, foolish.

660
00:37:39,894 --> 00:37:44,632
I went to his house,
and his wife answered.

661
00:37:44,665 --> 00:37:46,067
He was married to another.

662
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,904
As I said, a fool.

663
00:37:49,937 --> 00:37:53,306
He came to the door,
dragged me to a field,

664
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,376
and threw us
both on the ground.

665
00:37:56,409 --> 00:37:58,445
Me and my Dorina.

666
00:37:58,478 --> 00:38:00,748
I do not know that word.

667
00:38:00,782 --> 00:38:04,952
Not a word, a name.

668
00:38:04,986 --> 00:38:08,321
It means gift.

669
00:38:08,355 --> 00:38:09,824
My gift.

670
00:38:12,693 --> 00:38:15,630
Her father wanted
nothing to do with us.

671
00:38:15,663 --> 00:38:18,733
Swore he'd kill us if he
ever saw us again, so I ran.

672
00:38:21,401 --> 00:38:25,807
I tried to live in the woods,
but Dorina did not survive the
year.

673
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:31,712
I see a rage, Anton,

674
00:38:31,746 --> 00:38:34,916
but this is the past
and it cannot be changed.

675
00:38:34,949 --> 00:38:36,383
I want to hurt that man.

676
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:39,086
As did I,
but it would help nothing.

677
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,023
Murder does not
bring peace.

678
00:38:42,056 --> 00:38:43,891
You know this
better than most.

679
00:38:47,094 --> 00:38:50,397
I do.

680
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,099
So, I came here.

681
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:57,370
Ingolstadt is not
such a bad place.

682
00:38:57,404 --> 00:39:00,575
Lots of places to hide,
lots of drunks

683
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:03,744
who don't guard
their pockets.

684
00:39:03,778 --> 00:39:06,113
You're a thief?

685
00:39:06,147 --> 00:39:10,417
I'm whatever I need to be
to survive.

686
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:13,855
I understand that.

687
00:39:13,888 --> 00:39:16,757
You have my hand.

688
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:19,426
I've been reading it.

689
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:21,829
What?

690
00:39:21,863 --> 00:39:26,466
Your hand holds many things,
including the future.

691
00:39:26,499 --> 00:39:30,805
I have been following the lines,
trying to learn where they lead.

692
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:32,773
Should I pay you?

693
00:39:32,807 --> 00:39:37,044
You have let me steal bones
and dirt,

694
00:39:37,078 --> 00:39:39,513
and eased my burden
a little.

695
00:39:39,547 --> 00:39:42,750
No charge this time.

696
00:39:42,783 --> 00:39:46,187
What do you see?

697
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,955
It is confusing.

698
00:39:47,989 --> 00:39:49,690
Yours is a strange hand.

699
00:39:49,724 --> 00:39:51,893
It is?

700
00:39:51,926 --> 00:39:53,628
Yes.

701
00:39:53,661 --> 00:39:57,732
You are -- you were a man
of the fields.

702
00:39:57,765 --> 00:39:58,866
A farmer.

703
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,500
No.

704
00:40:00,534 --> 00:40:02,136
You were.
I can see it.

705
00:40:02,169 --> 00:40:05,172
I never spend a day
in the fields.

706
00:40:05,206 --> 00:40:06,641
You're certain?

707
00:40:06,674 --> 00:40:08,175
I am.

708
00:40:12,213 --> 00:40:15,016
Well, you have known
great love.

709
00:40:15,049 --> 00:40:17,585
I have?
Yes, it is here.

710
00:40:17,618 --> 00:40:20,453
A wife you loved
among all others.

711
00:40:20,487 --> 00:40:21,656
No.

712
00:40:21,689 --> 00:40:23,791
I know what is on your palm,
Anton?

713
00:40:23,824 --> 00:40:27,061
Whatever you reading, this
life didn't belong to me.

714
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:29,096
I think you are
being stubborn.

715
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:32,066
I think you're perhaps
not as good as you think.

716
00:40:33,634 --> 00:40:37,538
You would say such things
to one you fancy?

717
00:40:37,571 --> 00:40:40,808
You think I fancy you because
of what you see in my palm.

718
00:40:40,841 --> 00:40:43,711
Because of what I see
in your eyes.

719
00:40:43,744 --> 00:40:47,682
And I do not think,
I know.

720
00:40:47,715 --> 00:40:50,483
There is no shame in this,
my giant.

721
00:40:50,518 --> 00:40:54,121
Few can resist my charms.

722
00:40:54,155 --> 00:40:55,890
You're very confident.

723
00:40:55,923 --> 00:40:59,860
Well, I am many things,
all of which are Nadya.

724
00:41:01,896 --> 00:41:04,932
Do not turn away.

725
00:41:04,966 --> 00:41:09,103
What you feel,
it's a good thing.

726
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:12,974
The rush of blood,
the blush in your cheek,

727
00:41:13,007 --> 00:41:15,142
there is nothing better.

728
00:41:15,176 --> 00:41:17,545
I do not wish
to talk about it.

729
00:41:17,578 --> 00:41:19,814
So bashful you are.

730
00:41:19,847 --> 00:41:24,552
I feel strange, confused.

731
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:26,821
Tis the way of affection.

732
00:41:26,854 --> 00:41:30,257
It should be embraced,
not feared.

733
00:41:30,291 --> 00:41:34,595
But what if
it's not returned?

734
00:41:37,198 --> 00:41:40,768
My sweet
kind hearted friend.

735
00:41:40,801 --> 00:41:44,305
Why do think
so little of yourself?

736
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:45,639
I'm a monster.

737
00:41:45,673 --> 00:41:47,041
Not in my eyes.

738
00:41:47,074 --> 00:41:50,111
You would not say that
if you knew what I have done.

739
00:41:50,144 --> 00:41:53,848
People I have hurt,
killed.

740
00:41:53,881 --> 00:41:57,251
Monster would not hurt
inside as you do now.

741
00:41:57,284 --> 00:41:59,320
I do not know how to atone
for them.

742
00:41:59,353 --> 00:42:00,921
You can't.

743
00:42:00,955 --> 00:42:03,991
You can only do
what you have already done.

744
00:42:04,025 --> 00:42:05,259
Start over?

745
00:42:05,292 --> 00:42:07,728
Yes.

746
00:42:07,762 --> 00:42:08,996
Give me your other hand.

747
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,297
Why?

748
00:42:10,331 --> 00:42:12,967
This hand
tells me your past.

749
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,869
It is your future you wish
to see, yes?

750
00:42:14,902 --> 00:42:17,905
I do.
And my friend,
give me your other hand.

751
00:42:20,641 --> 00:42:21,942
Cacat.
What is it?

752
00:42:21,976 --> 00:42:23,778
What are you?
I do not understand.

753
00:42:23,811 --> 00:42:24,912
Why do you have two hands?

754
00:42:24,945 --> 00:42:26,614
Most people
have two hands.

755
00:42:26,647 --> 00:42:28,783
These are not the same hands.
These are...

756
00:42:28,816 --> 00:42:30,351
What?
The problem is same.

757
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:33,220
Both of them have --
They do not even
feel the same.

758
00:42:33,254 --> 00:42:36,824
The palms, the knuckles,
even the skin.

759
00:42:36,857 --> 00:42:39,026
These are the hands
of two different people.

760
00:42:41,929 --> 00:42:44,165
This is what
your face is like,

761
00:42:44,198 --> 00:42:46,100
a collection
of other men's faces?

762
00:42:46,133 --> 00:42:47,301
Do not ask me that?

763
00:42:47,334 --> 00:42:49,070
Good God, what are you?

764
00:42:49,103 --> 00:42:50,671
A monster.
I told you.

765
00:42:50,704 --> 00:42:51,839
I didn't believe you.

766
00:42:51,872 --> 00:42:53,307
Do you now?
Don't hurt me.

767
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:56,610
What?
Nadya, I'm not your enemy.

768
00:42:56,644 --> 00:42:58,279
I'm going to leave now,
Anton.
No!

769
00:42:58,312 --> 00:43:00,114
I'm going to leave,
and you are going to stay.

770
00:43:00,147 --> 00:43:01,949
I couldn't bear it
if you hated me.

771
00:43:01,982 --> 00:43:03,084
Just let me go.

772
00:43:03,117 --> 00:43:04,652
You wanted
to tell me my future.

773
00:43:04,685 --> 00:43:06,120
You have no future,
giant.

774
00:43:06,153 --> 00:43:08,889
Let me go.

775
00:43:08,923 --> 00:43:09,924
Nadya.

776
00:43:09,957 --> 00:43:11,725
Nadya!

777
00:43:31,779 --> 00:43:33,681
You can come in.

778
00:43:42,823 --> 00:43:44,291
Sit.

779
00:43:49,096 --> 00:43:51,866
I appreciate
your expediency.

780
00:43:51,899 --> 00:43:54,201
I appreciate your gold.

781
00:43:54,235 --> 00:43:57,771
Good motivation to get this
done tonight.

782
00:43:57,805 --> 00:44:00,141
Did it take long
to make the candle?

783
00:44:02,409 --> 00:44:04,378
You don't believe in this,
do you?

784
00:44:04,411 --> 00:44:08,449
It's up to you to make
a believer out of me.

785
00:44:08,482 --> 00:44:11,719
Give the fire a moment
to do its job.

786
00:44:11,752 --> 00:44:14,321
Dawn is a good time
to see the future.

787
00:44:14,355 --> 00:44:16,323
Just as a new day is born.

788
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:21,128
What is this ceromancy
supposed to tell me?

789
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:27,201
This is a doctor's word
for see in wax, yes?

790
00:44:27,234 --> 00:44:29,470
Yes.

791
00:44:29,504 --> 00:44:31,338
I like you, domnule.

792
00:44:31,372 --> 00:44:34,475
We both use strange words
to confuse those around us.

793
00:44:34,509 --> 00:44:37,044
I did not pay for banter.

794
00:44:37,077 --> 00:44:39,413
I am to see in wax, yes?

795
00:44:39,446 --> 00:44:41,949
Hard to do until
the candle melts some.

796
00:44:44,285 --> 00:44:48,055
Perhaps there are other things
we can do to pass the time.

797
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:50,791
No.

798
00:44:50,824 --> 00:44:52,793
I promise I'm well
worth the price.

799
00:44:54,795 --> 00:44:56,997
The only woman I ever loved

800
00:44:57,031 --> 00:45:01,035
had her neck snapped,
like dry wood.

801
00:45:01,068 --> 00:45:03,804
Don't touch me again.

802
00:45:06,407 --> 00:45:09,243
I do not like threats
so much.

803
00:45:09,276 --> 00:45:11,745
Do not mistake me
for some common alley rat

804
00:45:11,779 --> 00:45:14,148
you can gut
and leave in the snow.

805
00:45:14,181 --> 00:45:15,783
I am a barrack, a doctor,

806
00:45:15,816 --> 00:45:18,485
and in no way a man
to be trifled with.

807
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,955
Then why come to me?

808
00:45:20,988 --> 00:45:24,526
Because all sane means of
finding my query have failed.

809
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:28,829
So I must resort to this.

810
00:45:28,862 --> 00:45:33,000
Desperation can be
a good thing, boierule.

811
00:45:33,033 --> 00:45:34,902
Could be the best thing.

812
00:45:48,082 --> 00:45:49,917
What do you see?
Give me a moment.

813
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:51,952
This is an art,
not a science.

814
00:45:51,986 --> 00:45:54,054
Do not bait me, woman.
I asked you a question.

815
00:45:54,088 --> 00:45:56,257
What do you see in that --
Who do you seek?

816
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:57,992
Tell me of him.

817
00:45:58,025 --> 00:45:59,293
Speak while the wax warms.

818
00:45:59,326 --> 00:46:02,196
The more I know,
the clearer I can see.

819
00:46:02,229 --> 00:46:04,965
He is large,
very tall and broad.

820
00:46:04,999 --> 00:46:06,233
Good.

821
00:46:06,267 --> 00:46:08,936
He burned through my life
like wildfire.

822
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:13,440
He murdered my brother,
my father, my friends, my wife.

823
00:46:14,241 --> 00:46:16,243
Yes.
I can see it.

824
00:46:16,277 --> 00:46:19,446
He is close.

825
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,282
How close?

826
00:46:21,315 --> 00:46:22,850
Very.

827
00:46:22,883 --> 00:46:25,152
You have tracked him
to Ingolstadt, yes?

828
00:46:25,185 --> 00:46:27,955
Yes.
I was a student here.

829
00:46:27,988 --> 00:46:31,025
It was where
we were first...

830
00:46:31,058 --> 00:46:32,993
acquainted.

831
00:46:33,027 --> 00:46:34,596
I thought perhaps he would
return here, maybe --

832
00:46:34,629 --> 00:46:37,364
He has.

833
00:46:37,398 --> 00:46:41,335
Wait,
you must stop this hunt.

834
00:46:41,368 --> 00:46:43,070
What do you see?

835
00:46:43,103 --> 00:46:44,872
There is a chain wrapped tight
around the two of you.

836
00:46:44,905 --> 00:46:49,343
If you continue to hunt him,
it will be death for you both.

837
00:46:49,376 --> 00:46:51,912
I don't care if my death
is to bring his about,

838
00:46:51,945 --> 00:46:53,147
then it will be worth it.

839
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:56,083
You speak madness.
Stop.

840
00:46:56,116 --> 00:46:57,851
Rebuild a life.

841
00:46:57,885 --> 00:46:59,420
If you leave this place,
you and your prey

842
00:46:59,453 --> 00:47:00,854
will never see
each other again.

843
00:47:00,888 --> 00:47:02,256
I can't.

844
00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:03,525
He's more than my prey.

845
00:47:03,558 --> 00:47:07,127
Any lives he takes fall
squarely on my head.

846
00:47:07,161 --> 00:47:08,862
I don't understand.

847
00:47:11,398 --> 00:47:12,433
I made him.

848
00:47:15,035 --> 00:47:16,303
This man is your son?

849
00:47:16,337 --> 00:47:17,871
He is no man.

850
00:47:17,905 --> 00:47:19,239
He is a monster.

851
00:47:19,273 --> 00:47:21,241
Scarred and now.

852
00:47:23,043 --> 00:47:24,646
You've seen him?
No.

853
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:26,380
Tell me where he is.
Let me go.

854
00:47:26,413 --> 00:47:28,616
You have no gypsy camp
to come to your rescue, woman.

855
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:31,151
Tell me where he is.
I saw death in the water.

856
00:47:31,185 --> 00:47:33,053
If you continue to hunt him
any longer,

857
00:47:33,087 --> 00:47:36,423
you will meet your end in the
land of snow and frozen seas.

858
00:47:36,457 --> 00:47:38,359
I don't give a damn
about your prophecies.

859
00:47:38,392 --> 00:47:42,664
Tell me where he is.

860
00:47:42,697 --> 00:47:47,101
Kill me and you'll
never see him again.

861
00:47:48,969 --> 00:47:53,273
There are other gypsies
besides you.

862
00:47:53,307 --> 00:47:56,578
I imagine my coin would
make them very forthcoming.

863
00:48:02,216 --> 00:48:03,917
Is that it?

864
00:48:21,335 --> 00:48:23,203
I should be a better man
than this.

865
00:48:23,237 --> 00:48:25,172
So say all dogs.

866
00:48:25,205 --> 00:48:26,708
But for one mistake,
my life was to be

867
00:48:26,741 --> 00:48:28,676
full of light.

868
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:31,011
A family, a noble title,
a scientific advancement.

869
00:48:31,044 --> 00:48:32,212
And now --
Ah, yes.

870
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:36,016
All eyes weep for you,
rich man.

871
00:48:36,049 --> 00:48:38,218
I would gladly part
with every Franc

872
00:48:38,252 --> 00:48:40,421
if it meant putting an end
to this nightmare.

873
00:48:42,724 --> 00:48:44,458
Yours has been a hard life,
I take it?

874
00:48:47,294 --> 00:48:49,263
That is what I think
of your pity.

875
00:48:54,435 --> 00:48:58,071
And what do you
think of this?

876
00:48:58,105 --> 00:49:02,342
There is enough here
for you to start over.

877
00:49:02,376 --> 00:49:05,713
The dream of every pauper.

878
00:49:05,747 --> 00:49:10,685
And all you have to do is tell
me where to find the monster.

879
00:49:12,419 --> 00:49:14,421
So, that you can kill him?

880
00:49:16,524 --> 00:49:18,693
I'm not killing him.

881
00:49:18,726 --> 00:49:21,495
I am taking back a life
I should never have given.

882
00:49:23,798 --> 00:49:26,366
This is not your story.

883
00:49:28,636 --> 00:49:33,207
Take these coins and
remove yourself from it.

884
00:49:38,045 --> 00:49:39,547
Sit.

885
00:49:42,082 --> 00:49:43,685
We have much to discuss.

886
00:50:36,136 --> 00:50:37,672
Stop your worrying,
woman.

887
00:50:37,705 --> 00:50:40,307
I've returned
with more schnapps.

888
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,042
We'll be just fine.

889
00:50:44,278 --> 00:50:45,613
Hey!

890
00:50:45,647 --> 00:50:47,582
Anton, are you hurt?

891
00:50:47,615 --> 00:50:49,717
Anton!
Oh, my God!

892
00:50:49,751 --> 00:50:50,852
Hold on, boy!

893
00:50:50,885 --> 00:50:53,688
I'll get some bandages
or something!

894
00:50:53,721 --> 00:50:55,155
I want to die.
Don't worry!

895
00:50:55,188 --> 00:50:56,658
Not so long
as I am here.

896
00:50:58,358 --> 00:51:01,461
This knife,
I buried it deep.

897
00:51:01,495 --> 00:51:03,665
No man
could have survived!

898
00:51:03,698 --> 00:51:05,198
Every man should die.

899
00:51:05,232 --> 00:51:07,267
What are you talking about?
I'm not a man!

900
00:51:10,404 --> 00:51:13,340
I thrust its teeth
into my heart,

901
00:51:13,373 --> 00:51:15,877
through the muscles
between the ribs.

902
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:19,614
I could feel the blade
touch my backbone!

903
00:51:19,647 --> 00:51:21,849
I saw the blood
going out of the hole!

904
00:51:21,883 --> 00:51:23,417
That's impossible!

905
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:27,387
And my mind
did not stop it!

906
00:51:27,421 --> 00:51:29,122
I still hate!

907
00:51:29,156 --> 00:51:30,625
I still...

908
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:38,766
I should never live!
I should never have lived!

909
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,571
I am a mockery of nature!

910
00:51:45,807 --> 00:51:50,243
The night we met, I came here
to die, to this cemetery.

911
00:51:52,179 --> 00:51:54,381
Can you help?
Will you help me?

912
00:51:54,414 --> 00:51:56,651
Help you what?
Die! I want to die!

913
00:51:56,684 --> 00:51:58,620
No! No!

914
00:51:58,653 --> 00:52:01,288
Everything
turns against me.

915
00:52:01,321 --> 00:52:03,858
Kurt,
you're my only friend.

916
00:52:03,891 --> 00:52:05,893
If you don't kill me...
I won't!

917
00:52:05,927 --> 00:52:07,662
...then I will kill you.

918
00:52:07,695 --> 00:52:09,864
Okay?
I do not wish to,

919
00:52:09,897 --> 00:52:13,768
but I can feel already murder
rising up inside me,

920
00:52:13,801 --> 00:52:17,404
and soon I will turn mad,
and when that happens...

921
00:52:17,437 --> 00:52:19,841
Here!
Here, take this.

922
00:52:19,874 --> 00:52:20,875
What?
Take this!

923
00:52:20,908 --> 00:52:22,242
Strangle me!
No!

924
00:52:22,275 --> 00:52:23,678
Strangle me!
No! No! No!

925
00:52:23,711 --> 00:52:26,179
My breath will stop
and my heart will follow.

926
00:52:26,213 --> 00:52:27,782
No!
Listen to me!

927
00:52:27,815 --> 00:52:29,851
I may have --
I may have broken

928
00:52:29,884 --> 00:52:31,619
every vow
that I've ever taken,

929
00:52:31,653 --> 00:52:35,556
but I will never kill a man;
and certainly not you!

930
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:37,859
I want the pain to stop!

931
00:52:37,892 --> 00:52:39,259
It doesn't.

932
00:52:39,292 --> 00:52:40,762
I'm no better
than anyone,

933
00:52:40,795 --> 00:52:43,230
but life isn't about
the absent of pain!

934
00:52:43,263 --> 00:52:45,298
It's about enduring it!

935
00:52:45,332 --> 00:52:46,734
I cannot.

936
00:52:46,768 --> 00:52:48,770
I cannot.

937
00:52:48,803 --> 00:52:53,808
I find love, I find peace,
and then everything turns on me.

938
00:52:54,441 --> 00:52:55,843
And when that happens,

939
00:52:55,877 --> 00:52:58,946
I'll feel her neck break
in my hands!

940
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,982
I don't want
to!

941
00:53:01,015 --> 00:53:03,651
Nor do I.
You should fear me!

942
00:53:03,685 --> 00:53:05,218
You should fear
what I can do!

943
00:53:05,252 --> 00:53:09,289
Don't tell me what to do,
lummox!

944
00:53:09,322 --> 00:53:11,693
Get up!

945
00:53:11,726 --> 00:53:13,728
Whatever happened to you
when I was in town,

946
00:53:13,761 --> 00:53:16,731
for God's sakes, it's not
worth killing yourself over!

947
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,837
She said she was my friend.

948
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:25,740
She was surprised,
and then --

949
00:53:25,773 --> 00:53:29,677
and then she saw
what I really was.

950
00:53:29,711 --> 00:53:31,846
She saw what I truly am.

951
00:53:31,879 --> 00:53:33,581
And she fled.

952
00:53:33,614 --> 00:53:37,250
I should have known
it was a woman.

953
00:53:37,284 --> 00:53:41,589
You're not the first one to go
mad over a broken heart, Anton.

954
00:53:41,622 --> 00:53:44,592
Nor will you be the last.

955
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:47,929
All my life
I have been betrayed.

956
00:53:47,962 --> 00:53:49,630
Always.
Always.

957
00:53:49,664 --> 00:53:51,866
No such thing.

958
00:53:51,899 --> 00:53:55,469
A child is always a child
until he becomes a boy,

959
00:53:55,502 --> 00:53:57,805
and then a man
and then a corpse.

960
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:01,843
Take it from an old
gravedigger on that.

961
00:54:01,876 --> 00:54:04,277
She said I have no future.

962
00:54:04,311 --> 00:54:05,847
Will you wake up tomorrow?

963
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,548
Will something happen then?

964
00:54:07,582 --> 00:54:08,950
That's the future.

965
00:54:08,983 --> 00:54:11,451
Happens whether we think
it will or not.

966
00:54:11,485 --> 00:54:13,621
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry!

967
00:54:13,654 --> 00:54:15,590
Why?
Didn't that hurt?

968
00:54:15,623 --> 00:54:17,457
Where you cut
yourself?

969
00:54:17,491 --> 00:54:20,561
No,
I didn't cut myself.

970
00:54:20,595 --> 00:54:23,463
I stabbed myself!

971
00:54:23,497 --> 00:54:25,700
I'd think you were drunk already
if I hadn't drained

972
00:54:25,733 --> 00:54:29,570
the last
drop myself yesterday.

973
00:54:29,604 --> 00:54:31,739
You don't believe me?

974
00:54:31,773 --> 00:54:35,576
No, but when a man loves
a woman and then...

975
00:54:36,878 --> 00:54:39,614
I just think you're not thinking
straight is all.

976
00:54:39,647 --> 00:54:41,314
Do you know much
about women?

977
00:54:41,348 --> 00:54:42,517
Well, yes.

978
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:44,384
Well, not as much as some.

979
00:54:44,417 --> 00:54:45,987
What kind of question
is that?

980
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:49,289
I don't know. How many kinds
of questions are there?

981
00:54:52,425 --> 00:54:54,529
You were right about me.

982
00:54:54,562 --> 00:54:56,531
I was a priest, long ago.

983
00:54:56,564 --> 00:54:58,566
A lifetime ago.

984
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:02,402
I was happier then,
until I met a woman.

985
00:55:02,435 --> 00:55:04,572
Had you not
met women before?

986
00:55:04,605 --> 00:55:06,073
No.

987
00:55:06,107 --> 00:55:07,875
This woman in particular.

988
00:55:07,909 --> 00:55:10,678
Oh.
A married woman at that.

989
00:55:10,711 --> 00:55:13,548
The father hired her on
to clean the church.

990
00:55:13,581 --> 00:55:17,484
She wasn't a real beauty, Anton,
but her heart,

991
00:55:17,518 --> 00:55:19,821
so kind and pure

992
00:55:19,854 --> 00:55:23,591
and nothing but love
for this whole rotten world.

993
00:55:23,624 --> 00:55:27,128
We talked,
and she laughed.

994
00:55:27,161 --> 00:55:29,897
Oh, that laugh.

995
00:55:29,931 --> 00:55:31,632
Hers was a marriage
of convenience,

996
00:55:31,666 --> 00:55:33,634
though not that convenient
for me.

997
00:55:33,668 --> 00:55:35,970
I loved her.
I didn't want to.

998
00:55:36,003 --> 00:55:39,974
I tried not to, but it happened
all the same.

999
00:55:40,007 --> 00:55:41,576
Did she love you in return?

1000
00:55:41,609 --> 00:55:43,010
She did.

1001
00:55:43,044 --> 00:55:45,880
So I abandoned everything
I ever believed in,

1002
00:55:45,913 --> 00:55:48,816
this whole life I thought was
going to be my fate forever.

1003
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:50,051
All for her.

1004
00:55:50,084 --> 00:55:51,919
What of the husband?

1005
00:55:51,953 --> 00:55:53,386
We kept that the secret
at first,

1006
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:55,523
her from him,
me from the church.

1007
00:55:55,556 --> 00:55:57,091
But secrets never keep.

1008
00:55:57,124 --> 00:55:59,861
So I left the clergy
and she left her husband,

1009
00:55:59,894 --> 00:56:03,965
but he killed her, Anton.

1010
00:56:03,998 --> 00:56:06,601
Took a knife and just...

1011
00:56:06,634 --> 00:56:08,468
Then he came after me.

1012
00:56:08,501 --> 00:56:10,037
I was in the church
saying my goodbyes

1013
00:56:10,071 --> 00:56:13,140
when all of a sudden
this madman burst in.

1014
00:56:13,174 --> 00:56:15,176
He grabs me.

1015
00:56:15,209 --> 00:56:16,878
He throws me up
against the altar

1016
00:56:16,911 --> 00:56:21,148
and he sets
the church on fire.

1017
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:26,187
Says he was going to send us
all to hell.

1018
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:29,489
Poor bastard didn't count
on him dying first.

1019
00:56:29,523 --> 00:56:31,025
The timbers went up
like match sticks

1020
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:33,728
and the burning curtains,
they fell on him.

1021
00:56:33,761 --> 00:56:35,495
That seems just.

1022
00:56:35,529 --> 00:56:37,832
Oh, there was justice
to be had that night,

1023
00:56:37,865 --> 00:56:39,767
but that wasn't it.

1024
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,969
So there I was watching
everything

1025
00:56:42,003 --> 00:56:45,773
I know burn around me,
except it wasn't just me.

1026
00:56:45,806 --> 00:56:47,975
Five other people, men who had
been my friends

1027
00:56:48,009 --> 00:56:49,844
my entire life,
were going to die

1028
00:56:49,877 --> 00:56:51,913
because of what
I had done.

1029
00:56:51,946 --> 00:56:53,915
You did not
set the fire.

1030
00:56:53,948 --> 00:56:58,185
Oh, I didn't strike the tinder,
but I lit it all the same.

1031
00:56:58,219 --> 00:57:00,655
But I knew I had to get
to these men out.

1032
00:57:00,688 --> 00:57:03,658
The whole church
was falling in on itself.

1033
00:57:03,691 --> 00:57:07,094
So I started grabbing these men
and dragging them out.

1034
00:57:07,128 --> 00:57:08,763
The last of them,
my friend Gregor,

1035
00:57:08,796 --> 00:57:12,633
I had him over my shoulder
when all of a sudden,

1036
00:57:12,667 --> 00:57:15,102
down comes crashing
a support beam.

1037
00:57:15,136 --> 00:57:19,240
I managed to toss him out,
but then everything went black.

1038
00:57:19,273 --> 00:57:23,711
When I woke up,
the church, gone.

1039
00:57:23,744 --> 00:57:27,548
My leg, crushed,
broken beyond repair.

1040
00:57:28,816 --> 00:57:31,519
And <i>th</i> was justice, Anton.

1041
00:57:31,552 --> 00:57:33,554
I do not understand.

1042
00:57:33,587 --> 00:57:35,856
God was punishing me
for what I had done.

1043
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:37,792
He could have killed me
that night,

1044
00:57:37,825 --> 00:57:40,928
but I guess he's kinder
than that, or crueler.

1045
00:57:40,962 --> 00:57:43,164
Hard to tell sometimes.

1046
00:57:43,197 --> 00:57:47,101
So the church kept me on as
a courtesy, tending the dead.

1047
00:57:47,134 --> 00:57:50,805
Every night since that night,
I spend cleaning the paths,

1048
00:57:50,838 --> 00:57:53,941
reading the stones
and drinking away a life

1049
00:57:53,975 --> 00:57:56,510
I remember the way someone
remembers a story

1050
00:57:56,544 --> 00:57:58,980
he was told long ago.

1051
00:57:59,013 --> 00:58:02,717
Why did you tell me this?

1052
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:04,185
One day, Anton,
I will have to look

1053
00:58:04,218 --> 00:58:07,521
God in the eye and answer
for what I have done.

1054
00:58:07,555 --> 00:58:11,826
I think it will be easier if
I can do something good again.

1055
00:58:16,597 --> 00:58:17,832
You don't have to leave.

1056
00:58:17,865 --> 00:58:19,033
I don't want you to.

1057
00:58:20,968 --> 00:58:22,570
I'm not.

1058
00:58:27,174 --> 00:58:29,844
I said I'd tell you
about my face

1059
00:58:29,877 --> 00:58:31,746
when you told me
about your limp.

1060
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,942
Oh, my God.

1061
00:59:01,976 --> 00:59:03,978
God had nothing
to do with it.

1062
00:59:04,011 --> 00:59:05,746
Anton, don't go!

1063
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:08,616
Whatever you have done,
whatever has happened to you,

1064
00:59:08,649 --> 00:59:12,353
this is your home now,
if you want it.

1065
00:59:12,386 --> 00:59:14,688
I've never had a home.

1066
00:59:14,722 --> 00:59:19,193
Never is a lot like always,
it only exists until it doesn't.

1067
00:59:22,763 --> 00:59:24,131
Good.

1068
00:59:24,165 --> 00:59:27,935
Now I'm going to cook us
up some supper.

1069
00:59:27,968 --> 00:59:30,704
Where did you throw
my beans?

1070
00:59:30,738 --> 00:59:32,206
Ah, ah.

1071
00:59:35,843 --> 00:59:37,244
Put those down.

1072
00:59:37,278 --> 00:59:38,712
You don't need them here.

1073
00:59:45,186 --> 00:59:47,188
Don't stand there, we're going
to clean this place up.

1074
01:00:04,371 --> 01:00:06,107
How does it feel?

1075
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:07,341
Strange.

1076
01:00:07,374 --> 01:00:09,210
Being out in the open
as you are?

1077
01:00:09,243 --> 01:00:12,079
Yes.
I feel taller.

1078
01:00:12,113 --> 01:00:14,715
I'm not sure --
Christ, don't get
any taller on me.

1079
01:00:14,748 --> 01:00:17,351
I already need a damn ladder
to look you in the eye.

1080
01:00:17,384 --> 01:00:20,187
I'm so used
to hiding myself.

1081
01:00:20,221 --> 01:00:21,789
Every time I went
unwrapped,

1082
01:00:21,822 --> 01:00:23,958
the result
was always violent.

1083
01:00:23,991 --> 01:00:25,359
Well, there's no need
for that here.

1084
01:00:25,392 --> 01:00:28,362
Here, it's just me
and the buried bones.

1085
01:00:28,395 --> 01:00:32,333
I like your company, and there's
more than any other.

1086
01:00:32,366 --> 01:00:34,168
You can still do your work
at night.

1087
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:38,873
This is your graveyard
as much as it's mine.

1088
01:00:38,906 --> 01:00:41,942
Perhaps even more so.

1089
01:00:41,976 --> 01:00:43,310
I do more work than you.

1090
01:00:45,079 --> 01:00:47,114
You made a joke,
didn't you?

1091
01:00:47,148 --> 01:00:49,450
I did.
Not bad, lummox.

1092
01:00:49,483 --> 01:00:52,419
Not bad.
Thank you, runt.

1093
01:00:52,453 --> 01:00:53,888
What?

1094
01:00:53,921 --> 01:00:56,090
You call me lummox,
I can call you runt.

1095
01:00:56,123 --> 01:00:58,826
I'm not a runt.
You're just enormous.

1096
01:00:58,859 --> 01:01:01,328
And no more stabbings,
okay?

1097
01:01:01,362 --> 01:01:04,899
Finding corpses your size with
clean shirts is hard enough.

1098
01:01:08,736 --> 01:01:11,105
This is beautiful.

1099
01:01:11,138 --> 01:01:14,008
You think so?
I do.

1100
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:17,244
There's such order,
these grave markers.

1101
01:01:17,278 --> 01:01:19,713
It's like
a garden of stone.

1102
01:01:19,747 --> 01:01:23,284
And the trees,
guarding them.

1103
01:01:23,317 --> 01:01:26,253
The moonlight shining through
the branches,

1104
01:01:26,287 --> 01:01:31,258
making paths of light
through the mist.

1105
01:01:31,292 --> 01:01:33,194
It's so alive.

1106
01:01:33,227 --> 01:01:36,397
Not many say that
about this place.

1107
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:38,232
They don't see it
my way.

1108
01:01:38,265 --> 01:01:40,467
I cannot see the dead,

1109
01:01:40,501 --> 01:01:43,204
only the growing,
the living things.

1110
01:01:43,237 --> 01:01:44,471
The trees.

1111
01:01:44,506 --> 01:01:46,173
The vine.

1112
01:01:46,207 --> 01:01:49,743
The birds that sing
at night.

1113
01:01:49,777 --> 01:01:51,245
So alive.

1114
01:01:51,278 --> 01:01:54,281
I never saw it that way.

1115
01:01:54,315 --> 01:01:55,382
Do you now?

1116
01:01:57,284 --> 01:01:59,753
Oh, cold wind.

1117
01:01:59,787 --> 01:02:01,455
May be another
storm coming.

1118
01:02:01,488 --> 01:02:02,790
Come on.
Let's go get inside.

1119
01:02:02,823 --> 01:02:04,291
No.

1120
01:02:04,325 --> 01:02:06,493
You want to get thunderstruck,
as tall as you are?

1121
01:02:06,528 --> 01:02:09,196
I don't feel lightning
and thunder.

1122
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:11,198
I feel the wind
on my face.

1123
01:02:11,232 --> 01:02:13,300
So do I, so let's just
go get inside.

1124
01:02:13,334 --> 01:02:15,402
Is this God?

1125
01:02:15,436 --> 01:02:16,437
What?

1126
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:17,905
What do you feel?

1127
01:02:17,938 --> 01:02:19,139
Nothing.
Here.

1128
01:02:19,173 --> 01:02:23,010
What do you feel here?
I don't.

1129
01:02:23,043 --> 01:02:24,812
It's God's breath.

1130
01:02:24,845 --> 01:02:26,113
It's life.

1131
01:02:26,146 --> 01:02:27,515
It's all around us.

1132
01:02:27,549 --> 01:02:29,783
How do you know?

1133
01:02:29,817 --> 01:02:33,053
I just know.

1134
01:02:33,087 --> 01:02:34,288
Kurt, what is it?

1135
01:02:34,321 --> 01:02:35,789
Nothing.

1136
01:02:35,823 --> 01:02:37,191
Kurt, I'm your friend.
Yes?

1137
01:02:37,224 --> 01:02:39,827
Yes.
If I upset you,
then you need to --

1138
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:43,197
You didn't upset me.
Yeah, I just...

1139
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:45,533
When the wind blows,
all I feel is the wind.

1140
01:02:45,567 --> 01:02:47,901
And you stand around here
talking of God.

1141
01:02:47,935 --> 01:02:49,136
What do you know about it?

1142
01:02:49,169 --> 01:02:50,437
Do you know
what I would give to feel

1143
01:02:50,471 --> 01:02:52,940
God's presence again?

1144
01:02:52,973 --> 01:02:54,174
You're a priest.

1145
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:55,442
No, I was a priest,
and not

1146
01:02:55,476 --> 01:02:57,344
a very good one at that.

1147
01:02:57,378 --> 01:03:00,914
Ever since the day God took
my church and my leg,

1148
01:03:00,948 --> 01:03:02,950
he wants nothing
to do with.

1149
01:03:02,983 --> 01:03:04,385
He turns his back.

1150
01:03:04,418 --> 01:03:06,086
I turned mine.

1151
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,422
That's that.

1152
01:03:08,455 --> 01:03:10,357
A man burnt
your church down.

1153
01:03:10,391 --> 01:03:11,925
You tried to stop it.

1154
01:03:11,959 --> 01:03:15,262
And I'm sure the ashes
thank me for my efforts.

1155
01:03:15,296 --> 01:03:17,097
Do you see this?

1156
01:03:17,131 --> 01:03:20,034
This is all I have left
of that place.

1157
01:03:20,067 --> 01:03:21,969
Whenever my thoughts
turned to darkness,

1158
01:03:22,002 --> 01:03:23,370
all I had to do
was look at this.

1159
01:03:23,404 --> 01:03:24,838
Holds this.

1160
01:03:24,872 --> 01:03:27,308
And it was as if God was
holding my hand,

1161
01:03:27,341 --> 01:03:28,876
consoling me.

1162
01:03:28,909 --> 01:03:31,879
Now it's just cold,
dead wood.

1163
01:03:31,912 --> 01:03:34,114
Then why do you
still have it?

1164
01:03:38,586 --> 01:03:40,522
Enough of this
standing around.

1165
01:03:40,555 --> 01:03:42,524
My leg is locking up.

1166
01:03:42,557 --> 01:03:44,425
I want to stay
a little longer.

1167
01:03:44,458 --> 01:03:46,126
We have no graves
to dig tonight.

1168
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,928
I know.
I'm just happy.

1169
01:03:47,961 --> 01:03:49,296
I want to stay.

1170
01:03:49,330 --> 01:03:50,632
You don't have to ask
my permission.

1171
01:03:50,665 --> 01:03:52,866
I told you this was your home,
didn't I?

1172
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:55,436
You want to stay?
Stay!

1173
01:03:55,469 --> 01:03:57,539
Lummox.

1174
01:03:57,572 --> 01:03:59,106
Thank you.

1175
01:03:59,139 --> 01:04:00,274
Runt.

1176
01:04:35,643 --> 01:04:38,445
Trying to speak to birds?

1177
01:04:38,479 --> 01:04:40,314
I wonder what they think
you said.

1178
01:04:42,483 --> 01:04:45,319
Nadya.

1179
01:04:45,352 --> 01:04:47,054
Salutari, Anton.

1180
01:04:49,289 --> 01:04:51,358
I came here to warn you.

1181
01:04:51,392 --> 01:04:52,560
There are worse things
in the cemetery

1182
01:04:52,594 --> 01:04:54,662
than you and I
this night.

1183
01:05:09,209 --> 01:05:11,445
Hey!
Hey, who the hell are you?

1184
01:05:11,478 --> 01:05:13,213
Get out of my...

1185
01:05:13,247 --> 01:05:15,349
Wait a minute.
I know you, don't I?

1186
01:05:15,382 --> 01:05:18,986
We worked together, after a
fashion, a year ago.

1187
01:05:19,019 --> 01:05:20,988
You're that doctor.
Yes?
Victor.

1188
01:05:21,021 --> 01:05:24,057
Oh, Christ, the one I dug
up the corpses for.

1189
01:05:24,091 --> 01:05:25,993
Yes.
That's why I'm here in fact.

1190
01:05:26,026 --> 01:05:28,228
No, no, no, no. I'm telling you
now what I told you then!

1191
01:05:28,262 --> 01:05:30,130
Hear me out.
I am not pulling

1192
01:05:30,164 --> 01:05:32,065
another poor soul
out of the earth for you.

1193
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:34,468
Never again.
That's just it, though.

1194
01:05:34,501 --> 01:05:36,437
They don't have souls.

1195
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:38,506
See,
that's the mistake I made.

1196
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:41,475
There's no equation for it.
No chemical formula.

1197
01:05:41,509 --> 01:05:43,444
That part of them
has gone forever.

1198
01:05:43,477 --> 01:05:44,978
What are you
talking about?

1199
01:05:45,012 --> 01:05:47,615
Our child has come home,
Mr. Volker.

1200
01:05:47,649 --> 01:05:49,116
I made life with your help.

1201
01:05:49,149 --> 01:05:51,553
Didn't your partner talk to you?

1202
01:05:51,586 --> 01:05:54,455
I'm certain there needs to be
a lady involved somewhere.

1203
01:05:54,488 --> 01:05:57,157
What I did was far
beyond impregnating some girl.

1204
01:05:57,191 --> 01:05:58,492
I made life.

1205
01:05:58,526 --> 01:05:59,627
I don't know what
you're talking about!

1206
01:05:59,661 --> 01:06:01,195
I don't want to know!

1207
01:06:01,228 --> 01:06:02,764
And get out of here
before I toss you out!

1208
01:06:02,797 --> 01:06:04,331
Why do you think
I asked for parts

1209
01:06:04,364 --> 01:06:06,300
instead of entire bodies,
hmm?

1210
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:08,536
I wanted the strongest arms,
the sharpest eyes,

1211
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:10,003
the fiercest heart.

1212
01:06:10,037 --> 01:06:12,206
Each individual piece
had to be perfect.

1213
01:06:12,239 --> 01:06:14,308
Oh, but the sum total
was abominable.

1214
01:06:14,341 --> 01:06:16,276
Get yourself to an inn
and sleep it off!

1215
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:17,411
Now that abomination
is here.

1216
01:06:18,479 --> 01:06:21,516
You've got a gun.

1217
01:06:21,549 --> 01:06:23,283
Sit.

1218
01:06:39,601 --> 01:06:42,269
Calm yourself.

1219
01:06:42,302 --> 01:06:44,037
The bullet
isn't for you.

1220
01:06:50,444 --> 01:06:52,680
You're a priest, yes?
Something of that sort.

1221
01:06:52,714 --> 01:06:54,616
I think I remember
you saying that once.

1222
01:06:54,649 --> 01:06:57,084
Yes.

1223
01:06:57,117 --> 01:06:59,687
Can you still absolve
a man of his sins?

1224
01:06:59,721 --> 01:07:02,055
No, that part of my life
died long ago.

1225
01:07:02,089 --> 01:07:05,158
What if...

1226
01:07:05,192 --> 01:07:07,294
Could you try?

1227
01:07:07,327 --> 01:07:09,463
I'm sorry.
It doesn't work that way.

1228
01:07:09,496 --> 01:07:10,698
I never meant to hurt anyone.

1229
01:07:10,732 --> 01:07:12,667
You have to believe me.
All right.

1230
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:15,570
The work I was doing,
it was to preserve life,

1231
01:07:15,603 --> 01:07:17,705
perhaps indefinitely.

1232
01:07:17,739 --> 01:07:19,439
I don't know how it became
what it became.

1233
01:07:19,473 --> 01:07:22,142
Doctor, you're --
No, Victor. Please.

1234
01:07:22,175 --> 01:07:24,712
Victor, you seek absolution
from a man,

1235
01:07:24,746 --> 01:07:26,648
and not much
of a man at that.

1236
01:07:26,681 --> 01:07:29,684
My days in the confessional
are long behind me.

1237
01:07:29,717 --> 01:07:31,586
Just hear me out.

1238
01:07:31,619 --> 01:07:34,187
I beg you.

1239
01:07:34,221 --> 01:07:36,189
Mr. Volker,

1240
01:07:36,223 --> 01:07:39,694
when a child is born
naturally, as God intended,

1241
01:07:39,727 --> 01:07:43,731
it has time to grow,
to learn and adapt.

1242
01:07:43,765 --> 01:07:45,667
I think --

1243
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:49,236
I think this is where a soul
is formed.

1244
01:07:49,269 --> 01:07:51,573
But my creature
lacked all that.

1245
01:07:51,606 --> 01:07:53,373
He began his existence
fully formed

1246
01:07:53,407 --> 01:07:55,577
in a body stronger
than any 10 men,

1247
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:58,513
but with the emotional capacity
no greater than an infants.

1248
01:07:58,546 --> 01:08:00,447
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1249
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,216
I'm sorry, I don't.

1250
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:04,719
A baby is upset.

1251
01:08:04,752 --> 01:08:06,286
It lashes out.

1252
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:10,424
But it is small, fragile,
can harm no one.

1253
01:08:10,457 --> 01:08:12,492
Now imagine that same
blind emotion pure

1254
01:08:12,527 --> 01:08:14,461
and unaffected by thought,

1255
01:08:14,494 --> 01:08:17,832
but with the strength
of a giant behind it.

1256
01:08:17,865 --> 01:08:20,233
What the hell --
I fled from it.

1257
01:08:20,267 --> 01:08:21,836
I saw it rise up.

1258
01:08:21,869 --> 01:08:24,471
I saw its scarred
and mangled face.

1259
01:08:27,709 --> 01:08:29,544
Its dead, soulless eyes.

1260
01:08:32,379 --> 01:08:34,782
And I ran.

1261
01:08:34,816 --> 01:08:36,216
I left it to the world
in hopes

1262
01:08:36,249 --> 01:08:38,920
that it would sputter out
and die.

1263
01:08:38,953 --> 01:08:40,655
But it didn't die.

1264
01:08:40,688 --> 01:08:44,257
It endured in the world.
It offered it nothing but hate.

1265
01:08:44,291 --> 01:08:48,796
And so it became as monstrous
within as it was without.

1266
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:50,497
It tracked me down.

1267
01:08:54,602 --> 01:08:56,871
Killed my brother first.

1268
01:08:56,904 --> 01:08:58,271
William.

1269
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:05,479
No more than 10 years old,
and it snapped his neck

1270
01:09:05,513 --> 01:09:08,382
for no other reason
other than bringing me anguish.

1271
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:19,292
My servant, Justine,
was next.

1272
01:09:21,428 --> 01:09:23,263
And My friend, Henry.

1273
01:09:23,296 --> 01:09:26,701
A man who had never hurt
any living being, dead.

1274
01:09:26,734 --> 01:09:28,803
My servant's dead,
my father and my wife.

1275
01:09:28,836 --> 01:09:31,673
My...

1276
01:09:31,706 --> 01:09:33,340
My beautiful Elizabeth.

1277
01:09:37,444 --> 01:09:42,249
I saw him standing over her
broken body,

1278
01:09:42,282 --> 01:09:44,451
pointing at it
as he glared at me.

1279
01:09:46,721 --> 01:09:48,288
But he left me alive,

1280
01:09:48,321 --> 01:09:53,226
always alive to suffer his
wrath.

1281
01:10:02,737 --> 01:10:05,573
Now I have hunted him
these long months,

1282
01:10:05,606 --> 01:10:08,710
and my hunt
has led me here.

1283
01:10:08,743 --> 01:10:10,410
I've come to warn you,
the creature I described --

1284
01:10:10,444 --> 01:10:13,514
Anton!
What?

1285
01:10:13,548 --> 01:10:18,351
His name is Anton,
and he is that man no longer.

1286
01:10:18,385 --> 01:10:19,921
You know him?

1287
01:10:19,954 --> 01:10:21,756
He is my friend.
What did you say?!

1288
01:10:21,789 --> 01:10:24,926
Please, he is not what he was.
He has found peace here.

1289
01:10:24,959 --> 01:10:26,393
He has deceived you.

1290
01:10:26,426 --> 01:10:28,462
He's as clever
as he is savage.

1291
01:10:28,495 --> 01:10:29,664
He wanted to die!

1292
01:10:29,697 --> 01:10:31,899
He came here to die!
That's what he said.

1293
01:10:31,933 --> 01:10:36,503
But no, what he really wanted
was hope and friendship.

1294
01:10:38,639 --> 01:10:40,273
Hope?

1295
01:10:40,307 --> 01:10:41,642
Friendship?

1296
01:10:41,676 --> 01:10:43,845
What?

1297
01:10:43,878 --> 01:10:45,046
What?!

1298
01:10:45,079 --> 01:10:47,280
Oh, my day!

1299
01:10:47,314 --> 01:10:50,383
Doctor, I'm sorry.

1300
01:10:50,417 --> 01:10:52,687
Doctor, I'm sorry for what
he has done to you.

1301
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:55,288
I am.
No man should suffer like that.

1302
01:10:55,322 --> 01:10:58,358
But I'm telling you,
if you leave, if you let him go,

1303
01:10:58,391 --> 01:11:00,561
he will never hurt
another living soul.

1304
01:11:08,836 --> 01:11:12,372
So, this is your face?

1305
01:11:12,405 --> 01:11:14,374
Yes.

1306
01:11:14,407 --> 01:11:15,610
Can I touch it?

1307
01:11:15,643 --> 01:11:16,644
Why would you want that?

1308
01:11:16,677 --> 01:11:18,079
I'm curious.

1309
01:11:18,112 --> 01:11:22,550
Last time you laid your hands
on me, you ran in fear.

1310
01:11:22,583 --> 01:11:25,452
I know.

1311
01:11:25,485 --> 01:11:28,055
I'm not inclined
to trust you now.

1312
01:11:28,089 --> 01:11:30,323
How could I hurt you?

1313
01:11:30,357 --> 01:11:32,392
You hurt me already,
deeply;

1314
01:11:32,425 --> 01:11:34,629
and I have no desire
to experience that again.

1315
01:11:38,966 --> 01:11:40,968
You came here to warn me?

1316
01:11:41,002 --> 01:11:42,904
Then do so and be gone.

1317
01:11:42,937 --> 01:11:46,007
There's a man in Ingolstadt,
he is hunting you.

1318
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,407
I'm no stranger to that.

1319
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,342
He is your father.

1320
01:11:49,376 --> 01:11:51,078
What?
About this tall.

1321
01:11:51,112 --> 01:11:52,513
Dark hair, wild eyes.

1322
01:11:52,547 --> 01:11:54,081
He came to me last night,

1323
01:11:54,115 --> 01:11:58,351
paid me to see his future,
to help him find you.

1324
01:11:58,385 --> 01:11:59,587
And you did this?

1325
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:01,589
Did you tell my father
I was here?!

1326
01:12:01,622 --> 01:12:03,524
I live in filth!

1327
01:12:03,558 --> 01:12:06,426
I have no family anymore,
no friends.

1328
01:12:06,459 --> 01:12:08,395
Only men who would pay
to see their future

1329
01:12:08,428 --> 01:12:09,897
and to see up my skirts.
You...

1330
01:12:09,931 --> 01:12:13,835
This man offered more gold
than I could earn in a year.

1331
01:12:13,868 --> 01:12:15,402
You betrayed me.

1332
01:12:15,435 --> 01:12:18,739
Yes, damn it, and I'm trying
to make it right.

1333
01:12:18,773 --> 01:12:22,577
Why? Why would you care if he
finds me, if he ends my life?

1334
01:12:22,610 --> 01:12:25,546
To you I'm just a monster.
Stop attacking me.

1335
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:28,883
I have not attacked you yet,
little gypsy.

1336
01:12:28,916 --> 01:12:33,988
You should know that because
you are still breathing.

1337
01:12:34,021 --> 01:12:35,857
I protected you.

1338
01:12:37,592 --> 01:12:40,493
Your words mean
less than nothing.

1339
01:12:43,798 --> 01:12:46,399
He told me what you did.

1340
01:12:46,433 --> 01:12:49,737
The people you killed.

1341
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:53,541
His brother, his wife.

1342
01:12:53,574 --> 01:12:55,109
You may look your crooked nose
down on me,

1343
01:12:55,142 --> 01:12:56,611
but you are no innocent.

1344
01:12:56,644 --> 01:12:58,713
You have bloodied your hands
more in a year

1345
01:12:58,746 --> 01:13:00,982
than I could in a lifetime.

1346
01:13:01,015 --> 01:13:04,852
I came here to become
something better than I was.

1347
01:13:04,886 --> 01:13:09,190
I left man's world behind
and entombed myself here.

1348
01:13:09,223 --> 01:13:11,726
I have traveled further
than you can imagine,

1349
01:13:11,759 --> 01:13:13,661
and this much
I know is true.

1350
01:13:13,694 --> 01:13:15,596
Unless you flee to the frozen
north itself,

1351
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:18,065
you will never
be free of men.

1352
01:13:18,099 --> 01:13:20,635
The doctor said he had
some business to attend to,

1353
01:13:20,668 --> 01:13:21,802
someone he had
to warn about you.

1354
01:13:21,836 --> 01:13:23,436
Do you know what that means?
No.

1355
01:13:23,470 --> 01:13:24,939
It means you can
leave here tonight

1356
01:13:24,972 --> 01:13:26,841
and be gone
before he finds you.

1357
01:13:26,874 --> 01:13:30,211
That is what I came here
to say.

1358
01:13:30,244 --> 01:13:33,581
First you sell me to my enemy
and then you aid in my escape?

1359
01:13:33,614 --> 01:13:35,082
Do not presume
to know my mind.

1360
01:13:35,116 --> 01:13:36,651
This is my home.

1361
01:13:36,684 --> 01:13:38,019
Then it is good there are
many graves here,

1362
01:13:38,052 --> 01:13:40,621
for the doctor
will most likely but you in one.

1363
01:13:40,655 --> 01:13:42,623
I've done
what I came here to do.

1364
01:13:42,657 --> 01:13:45,026
Flee or die,
the choice is yours.

1365
01:13:45,059 --> 01:13:47,028
I should break your neck.

1366
01:13:47,061 --> 01:13:49,030
I have done worse
for less.

1367
01:13:49,063 --> 01:13:51,464
Try it,
and I'll cut your throat.

1368
01:13:51,498 --> 01:13:53,000
You can try.
Stay back.

1369
01:13:55,636 --> 01:13:58,639
You are the only woman
who has ever shown me kindness.

1370
01:13:58,673 --> 01:14:00,775
I should have known better
than to trust you.

1371
01:14:00,808 --> 01:14:02,510
Let me go.
Why?

1372
01:14:02,543 --> 01:14:03,978
So, you can cut my throat?

1373
01:14:04,011 --> 01:14:05,646
I won't hurt you.
Please.

1374
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:08,215
We are far past that,
Nadya.

1375
01:14:11,886 --> 01:14:14,689
Part of me always loved you
the first moment I saw you.

1376
01:14:14,722 --> 01:14:16,524
You are so beautiful.

1377
01:14:16,557 --> 01:14:19,026
I wanted to be that close
to your beauty.

1378
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:20,594
You still can be.

1379
01:14:20,628 --> 01:14:21,996
You're just saying that
to save your life.

1380
01:14:22,029 --> 01:14:23,496
I can hear the lie
in your voice.

1381
01:14:23,531 --> 01:14:24,865
I'm not lying.
I'm not lying.

1382
01:14:24,899 --> 01:14:27,134
Look at me.
Look at me.

1383
01:14:27,168 --> 01:14:30,905
Do you wish these dead lips
to kiss you?

1384
01:14:30,938 --> 01:14:32,940
These patchwork
hands to caress you?

1385
01:14:32,974 --> 01:14:36,177
Or does your bile rise when
I'm this close to your face?

1386
01:14:59,033 --> 01:15:03,971
I could run from you now,
but I am still here.

1387
01:15:04,005 --> 01:15:07,575
There is no gain
in this for me.

1388
01:15:07,608 --> 01:15:10,745
Why?
Because I have hurt you.

1389
01:15:10,778 --> 01:15:12,747
Because I will
not do it again.

1390
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:14,015
Stop.

1391
01:15:14,048 --> 01:15:15,783
Anton, stop.

1392
01:15:26,794 --> 01:15:29,997
This face...

1393
01:15:30,031 --> 01:15:32,033
is not
such a bad face.

1394
01:15:37,972 --> 01:15:39,273
I was trying to kill you.

1395
01:15:39,306 --> 01:15:41,809
No.
I had my hands
around your neck.

1396
01:15:41,842 --> 01:15:44,211
You lashed out at one
who could hurt you,

1397
01:15:44,245 --> 01:15:46,580
but no, you would
not have killed me.

1398
01:15:46,614 --> 01:15:48,215
You are that man
no longer.

1399
01:15:48,249 --> 01:15:50,618
How do you know?

1400
01:15:50,651 --> 01:15:55,322
Because that man hid
his face from the world.

1401
01:15:55,356 --> 01:15:57,291
You have nothing
to hide now.

1402
01:16:03,164 --> 01:16:05,566
I will be sad
to leave this place.

1403
01:16:08,402 --> 01:16:10,071
I'm sorry that you must.

1404
01:16:12,306 --> 01:16:16,210
But you found a little piece
of your soul here.

1405
01:16:16,243 --> 01:16:19,780
Perhaps there are other pieces
out there, I think.

1406
01:16:22,283 --> 01:16:25,052
You kissed me.

1407
01:16:25,086 --> 01:16:28,656
Yes.

1408
01:16:28,689 --> 01:16:31,892
I think it was goodbye.

1409
01:16:31,926 --> 01:16:33,260
As do I.

1410
01:16:50,010 --> 01:16:51,278
Kurt.

1411
01:16:53,214 --> 01:16:54,815
Kurt, if you're asleep,
I have to wake --

1412
01:16:58,018 --> 01:16:59,120
Doctor.

1413
01:16:59,153 --> 01:17:02,056
Do not move.

1414
01:17:02,089 --> 01:17:03,757
Do not think of moving.

1415
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:05,159
Am I understood?

1416
01:17:05,192 --> 01:17:08,195
I do not fear you.

1417
01:17:08,229 --> 01:17:10,664
I don't need your fear.

1418
01:17:10,698 --> 01:17:11,832
I need your acquiescence.

1419
01:17:11,866 --> 01:17:13,300
Where's Kurt?

1420
01:17:13,334 --> 01:17:14,935
He's safe.

1421
01:17:14,969 --> 01:17:16,670
And if you wish him
to remain thus,

1422
01:17:16,704 --> 01:17:19,740
you will do as I say.

1423
01:17:19,773 --> 01:17:21,142
Sit.
If you have hurt --

1424
01:17:21,175 --> 01:17:25,079
I said sit.

1425
01:17:44,031 --> 01:17:46,233
Can you sense it?

1426
01:17:46,267 --> 01:17:47,935
In the dark?

1427
01:17:49,937 --> 01:17:54,141
The hatred between us clings
to the air like a cold mist.

1428
01:17:55,142 --> 01:17:57,077
What do you want,
Father?

1429
01:17:57,111 --> 01:17:59,847
Don't call me that.

1430
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,916
I am not your father.

1431
01:18:01,949 --> 01:18:03,918
If not you, then who?

1432
01:18:08,055 --> 01:18:10,858
You are the devil's orphan,
if you are anything at all.

1433
01:18:12,893 --> 01:18:15,863
God and the devil?

1434
01:18:15,896 --> 01:18:19,900
I thought you put no stake
in such things.

1435
01:18:27,308 --> 01:18:31,912
My perspective has grown
since you destroyed my life.

1436
01:18:37,218 --> 01:18:39,019
What is this?

1437
01:18:39,053 --> 01:18:41,455
If you wish to see the
gravedigger again, you will --

1438
01:18:43,958 --> 01:18:46,160
Kill me and you will never
know where I hid Mr. Volker.

1439
01:18:46,193 --> 01:18:48,229
He'll die of his wounds
unless I tend to him.

1440
01:18:58,105 --> 01:19:01,008
I have every
advantage now.

1441
01:19:01,041 --> 01:19:03,844
Even if you kill me,
you'd only bring me peace.

1442
01:19:06,313 --> 01:19:08,816
But for your friend's sake,

1443
01:19:08,849 --> 01:19:10,351
quench your thirst.

1444
01:19:12,419 --> 01:19:14,355
You mean to poison me.

1445
01:19:16,824 --> 01:19:20,794
I mean to drug you,
actually.

1446
01:19:20,828 --> 01:19:23,197
Poison would end
this too quickly,

1447
01:19:23,230 --> 01:19:26,568
considering your
distinct metabolism.

1448
01:19:26,601 --> 01:19:28,802
But I'm confident the contents
of that cup

1449
01:19:28,836 --> 01:19:31,238
will weaken your body without
dulling your mind too much.

1450
01:19:36,010 --> 01:19:39,179
I want you awake
for what comes next.

1451
01:19:41,315 --> 01:19:43,284
What does come next?

1452
01:19:45,319 --> 01:19:48,022
Put cup to lip
and find out.

1453
01:20:04,506 --> 01:20:06,173
You'll willingly
cripple yourself

1454
01:20:06,206 --> 01:20:08,576
for the sake of a drunken
wretch you barely know?

1455
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:11,478
He is my friend.

1456
01:20:11,513 --> 01:20:13,981
You are a collection
of corpses.

1457
01:20:14,014 --> 01:20:17,484
Somewhere between a charnel pit
and a butcher's floor.

1458
01:20:17,519 --> 01:20:19,286
You have no friends.

1459
01:20:22,222 --> 01:20:24,992
And so the chemicals
do their work.

1460
01:20:25,025 --> 01:20:27,261
Don't bother fighting it.

1461
01:20:27,294 --> 01:20:30,130
I fought all my life.

1462
01:20:30,164 --> 01:20:33,300
No one knows
that better than I.

1463
01:20:36,337 --> 01:20:39,173
You know, I thought...

1464
01:20:39,206 --> 01:20:41,375
I thought I wouldn't
be able to control myself

1465
01:20:41,408 --> 01:20:44,411
when I saw you again.

1466
01:20:44,445 --> 01:20:49,283
I have a great desire to revenge
myself upon you, but you --

1467
01:20:49,316 --> 01:20:53,387
you have no idea, no idea
of the time nor resources,

1468
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:55,557
the very lifeblood,
all the things

1469
01:20:55,590 --> 01:20:59,360
I poured
into your creation.

1470
01:20:59,393 --> 01:21:02,530
You were meant to be the
greatest scientific achievement

1471
01:21:02,564 --> 01:21:05,299
mankind had ever witnessed.

1472
01:21:05,332 --> 01:21:08,402
I want very much to know
where that went wrong.

1473
01:21:08,435 --> 01:21:09,436
You will never know.

1474
01:21:09,470 --> 01:21:12,039
Don't be petulant, beast!

1475
01:21:12,072 --> 01:21:14,274
Let your death
mean something.

1476
01:21:14,308 --> 01:21:17,044
I have no answers
for you.

1477
01:21:24,619 --> 01:21:28,288
You are in many ways
a perfect being.

1478
01:21:28,322 --> 01:21:32,393
Stronger than any man before,
senses sharper

1479
01:21:32,426 --> 01:21:36,196
than any animals.

1480
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:39,099
And your mind,

1481
01:21:39,133 --> 01:21:44,204
I put within your misshapen
skull the mind of a genius.

1482
01:21:44,238 --> 01:21:48,142
And yet here you are,
a rag covered madman.

1483
01:21:48,175 --> 01:21:49,611
What a waste.

1484
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:54,281
Why did you
become this demon?

1485
01:21:54,314 --> 01:21:56,984
What turned you into this?

1486
01:21:58,753 --> 01:22:02,055
You.

1487
01:22:02,089 --> 01:22:04,592
All my short life,

1488
01:22:04,626 --> 01:22:07,161
I've only wanted
one thing --

1489
01:22:07,194 --> 01:22:08,663
your love.

1490
01:22:08,696 --> 01:22:12,199
Even when you abandoned me,
I wanted to know you.

1491
01:22:12,232 --> 01:22:15,436
A father's love,
all any child wants.

1492
01:22:15,469 --> 01:22:17,539
Quiet.

1493
01:22:17,572 --> 01:22:22,577
Instead you gave me hate,
and I took that hate

1494
01:22:23,076 --> 01:22:26,748
and I poured it
where my soul should have been.

1495
01:22:32,554 --> 01:22:35,489
I am sorry.

1496
01:22:35,523 --> 01:22:39,092
Sorry that I
ever made you.

1497
01:22:39,126 --> 01:22:43,363
Sorry that you lived long enough
to become this thing.

1498
01:22:43,397 --> 01:22:47,034
Sorry that yours has been
a life of unending horror.

1499
01:22:47,067 --> 01:22:48,770
But I have paid
for my mistakes.

1500
01:22:48,803 --> 01:22:51,371
You have to pay for yours.

1501
01:22:51,405 --> 01:22:54,374
Do you understand me?

1502
01:22:54,408 --> 01:22:56,578
I don't know.

1503
01:22:56,611 --> 01:23:01,616
After all I have done,
it seems you should kill me.

1504
01:23:02,584 --> 01:23:06,053
But for the first time,
I want to live.

1505
01:23:11,593 --> 01:23:15,730
The answers I seek,

1506
01:23:15,763 --> 01:23:19,534
I'll never find them,
will I?

1507
01:23:19,567 --> 01:23:22,770
I do not know.

1508
01:23:25,673 --> 01:23:29,142
I just...

1509
01:23:29,176 --> 01:23:32,446
I can make
some sense of this.

1510
01:23:32,479 --> 01:23:33,515
Everything
that has happened...

1511
01:23:33,548 --> 01:23:34,682
Perhaps then I would...

1512
01:23:39,353 --> 01:23:42,824
I suppose it doesn't matter
in the end.

1513
01:23:42,857 --> 01:23:44,559
Is this the end?

1514
01:23:47,227 --> 01:23:49,564
Yes.
I believe it is.

1515
01:23:49,597 --> 01:23:52,299
Wait. No.
My friend.

1516
01:23:52,332 --> 01:23:53,333
Let me see my friend.

1517
01:23:53,367 --> 01:23:55,168
I owe you nothing!

1518
01:23:55,202 --> 01:23:57,672
You owe me everything!

1519
01:23:57,705 --> 01:23:59,841
I exist only
because of you!

1520
01:23:59,874 --> 01:24:01,676
You won't trick me again.

1521
01:24:01,709 --> 01:24:03,711
Please!
Please!

1522
01:24:03,745 --> 01:24:05,178
I beg you!

1523
01:24:05,212 --> 01:24:08,181
Let me tell him goodbye.!

1524
01:24:08,215 --> 01:24:11,151
Indeed.

1525
01:24:11,184 --> 01:24:14,722
There's still something human
left inside you.

1526
01:24:41,448 --> 01:24:45,319
Here.
Say your goodbyes.

1527
01:24:45,352 --> 01:24:48,723
I thought you left him
near death.

1528
01:24:48,756 --> 01:24:51,859
A small lie would be
the least of my sins.

1529
01:24:51,893 --> 01:24:53,493
Untie me, you whore's son.

1530
01:24:53,528 --> 01:24:55,295
I'll rip your throat out
with my teeth.

1531
01:24:55,329 --> 01:24:56,330
Kurt, listen.

1532
01:24:56,363 --> 01:24:57,565
Has that bastard hurt you?

1533
01:24:57,599 --> 01:24:58,733
A sedative only.

1534
01:24:58,766 --> 01:25:00,400
Christ,
I'm glad to hear that.

1535
01:25:00,434 --> 01:25:01,869
You've got to listen,
Kurt.

1536
01:25:01,903 --> 01:25:04,371
I'll get us out of this, boy.
Don't you worry.

1537
01:25:04,404 --> 01:25:06,173
Thank you
for teaching me everything

1538
01:25:06,206 --> 01:25:08,643
that was worth knowing.

1539
01:25:08,676 --> 01:25:10,310
The last past week,

1540
01:25:10,344 --> 01:25:13,881
I became someone better
just because of you.

1541
01:25:13,915 --> 01:25:15,315
What are you saying?

1542
01:25:15,349 --> 01:25:16,751
Goodbye.

1543
01:25:16,784 --> 01:25:18,720
Close your eyes,
Mr. Volker.

1544
01:25:18,753 --> 01:25:21,656
No!
I'll give you anything.

1545
01:25:21,689 --> 01:25:23,691
Whatever you want.
If I don't have it, I'll get it.

1546
01:25:23,725 --> 01:25:25,492
Just don't hurt him.

1547
01:25:25,526 --> 01:25:27,227
It's true then.

1548
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:28,529
You care for each other?

1549
01:25:28,563 --> 01:25:29,764
I don't want
to see him die,

1550
01:25:29,797 --> 01:25:32,165
and I don't want
to see you damned.

1551
01:25:32,199 --> 01:25:35,837
My damnation is forgot
at this point, but...

1552
01:25:35,870 --> 01:25:37,772
I have an idea, beast.

1553
01:25:39,841 --> 01:25:42,577
You were right about me,
partially at any rate.

1554
01:25:42,610 --> 01:25:44,579
I never taught you anything.

1555
01:25:44,612 --> 01:25:46,246
Every lesson you ever learned
you learned

1556
01:25:46,279 --> 01:25:48,750
at the bootheel
of the world.

1557
01:25:48,783 --> 01:25:51,686
But now I can show you something
before you cease to be.

1558
01:25:51,719 --> 01:25:55,255
What?

1559
01:25:55,288 --> 01:25:58,660
This -- this is to slit
your throat in a moment.

1560
01:25:58,693 --> 01:26:00,928
But, the pistol.

1561
01:26:00,962 --> 01:26:03,296
The pistol isn't
for you anymore.

1562
01:26:03,330 --> 01:26:04,866
No, Christ!

1563
01:26:04,899 --> 01:26:07,935
You have murdered every single
person I have ever cared about,

1564
01:26:07,969 --> 01:26:09,436
and I will show you
what that feels like.

1565
01:26:09,469 --> 01:26:11,405
Kurt.

1566
01:26:11,438 --> 01:26:13,306
The pain you reap
with all your life

1567
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:15,409
is nothing compared
to the lessons I'll give you.

1568
01:26:15,442 --> 01:26:16,544
No!

1569
01:26:32,927 --> 01:26:37,565
The dosage was not correct,
Father.

1570
01:26:40,001 --> 01:26:43,303
Anton, don't!

1571
01:26:43,336 --> 01:26:45,673
You would have killed
the only person

1572
01:26:45,707 --> 01:26:47,842
that ever showed me kindness
and call it justice.

1573
01:26:47,875 --> 01:26:50,545
Please help.

1574
01:26:50,578 --> 01:26:53,548
You said if I kill you,
you'll find peace.

1575
01:26:53,581 --> 01:26:54,782
Let us see.

1576
01:27:00,655 --> 01:27:02,657
Then I will be
free of you at last.

1577
01:27:09,329 --> 01:27:10,464
Stop!

1578
01:27:10,497 --> 01:27:12,466
He has to die!

1579
01:27:14,301 --> 01:27:15,870
I am not a man!

1580
01:27:15,903 --> 01:27:18,806
You are a man!

1581
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,454
Watch out!

1582
01:27:39,861 --> 01:27:41,796
Get it off.

1583
01:27:41,829 --> 01:27:43,430
Off of me.

1584
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:49,871
He'll live.

1585
01:27:49,904 --> 01:27:53,074
I had to be sure.

1586
01:27:53,107 --> 01:27:54,809
Are you all right?

1587
01:27:54,842 --> 01:27:57,044
No.

1588
01:27:57,078 --> 01:28:00,014
But I'll live.

1589
01:28:00,047 --> 01:28:01,716
What do we do now?

1590
01:28:09,824 --> 01:28:11,526
All clear.

1591
01:28:18,966 --> 01:28:21,068
Oh, you're quite a sight.

1592
01:28:21,102 --> 01:28:23,571
So I've been told.

1593
01:28:23,604 --> 01:28:25,907
The policemen?
Gone.

1594
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:28,109
And they took the doctor
with them.

1595
01:28:28,142 --> 01:28:29,877
What did you tell them?

1596
01:28:29,911 --> 01:28:31,378
The truth, more or less.

1597
01:28:31,411 --> 01:28:33,581
The doctor came in raving,
attacked me,

1598
01:28:33,614 --> 01:28:36,117
and I managed
to fight him off.

1599
01:28:36,150 --> 01:28:38,351
That was not the truth.

1600
01:28:38,385 --> 01:28:42,056
I could have taken him out
if you hadn't showed up first.

1601
01:28:42,089 --> 01:28:43,791
I think you're wrong.

1602
01:28:43,825 --> 01:28:45,492
What do you know?

1603
01:28:45,526 --> 01:28:48,062
I know what
embellishment means.

1604
01:28:50,932 --> 01:28:53,433
You're getting a feeling
for jokes.

1605
01:28:53,466 --> 01:28:54,769
I'm learning.

1606
01:28:54,802 --> 01:28:56,571
That was quite a trick,
by the way.

1607
01:28:56,604 --> 01:28:58,371
Catching the bullet.

1608
01:28:58,405 --> 01:29:00,074
Oh, I'm faster than most.

1609
01:29:00,107 --> 01:29:01,542
Thank you.

1610
01:29:01,576 --> 01:29:02,844
For being fast?

1611
01:29:02,877 --> 01:29:05,713
No, for saving my life,
you damned lummox.

1612
01:29:05,746 --> 01:29:08,683
Had I not come here, your life
would never have been in danger.

1613
01:29:08,716 --> 01:29:12,419
I don't care for the wheres
and whyfores, I...

1614
01:29:12,452 --> 01:29:15,690
Thank you.

1615
01:29:15,723 --> 01:29:17,124
You're welcome.

1616
01:29:17,158 --> 01:29:19,026
The doctor
said mum about you.

1617
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:20,493
I thought as much.

1618
01:29:20,528 --> 01:29:22,563
He wants
to kill me himself.

1619
01:29:22,597 --> 01:29:24,565
Maybe he'll stop now.

1620
01:29:24,599 --> 01:29:26,133
He will never stop.

1621
01:29:26,167 --> 01:29:29,103
The only thing I have done
is gained a little time.

1622
01:29:29,136 --> 01:29:32,106
Alright then.
What will you do with that time?

1623
01:29:32,139 --> 01:29:33,841
I have to leave, Kurt.

1624
01:29:33,875 --> 01:29:35,142
No, you don't.

1625
01:29:35,176 --> 01:29:36,677
I do.
You know I do.

1626
01:29:36,711 --> 01:29:38,045
Because of the doctor?

1627
01:29:38,079 --> 01:29:39,714
Who knows how long
they'll put him behind bars.

1628
01:29:39,747 --> 01:29:41,949
He attacked a priest.

1629
01:29:41,983 --> 01:29:46,153
He will escape, and he will
hunt me till he's dead.

1630
01:29:46,187 --> 01:29:49,156
And I no longer have it in me
to kill him.

1631
01:29:49,190 --> 01:29:50,992
Maybe you never did.

1632
01:29:51,025 --> 01:29:52,960
I did.

1633
01:29:52,994 --> 01:29:57,698
Before I came here,
before I met you,

1634
01:29:57,732 --> 01:30:00,701
murder came as easily to me
as breathing.

1635
01:30:00,735 --> 01:30:02,536
I want you to stay.

1636
01:30:02,570 --> 01:30:04,171
So do I.

1637
01:30:04,205 --> 01:30:06,908
Wherever I am,
no one is safe.

1638
01:30:06,941 --> 01:30:08,643
Tonight taught me that.

1639
01:30:08,676 --> 01:30:10,111
This is your home.

1640
01:30:10,144 --> 01:30:12,179
And I will always think of it
like that

1641
01:30:12,213 --> 01:30:13,781
no matter where I go.

1642
01:30:13,814 --> 01:30:16,217
The doctor told me something
I think you should know.

1643
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:19,720
What?
Do you know why
you came here?

1644
01:30:19,754 --> 01:30:20,988
To this graveyard?

1645
01:30:21,022 --> 01:30:22,790
Yes.

1646
01:30:22,823 --> 01:30:26,493
I was lost and wandering,
and then I found myself here.

1647
01:30:26,527 --> 01:30:28,763
I think there's more to it
than that.

1648
01:30:28,796 --> 01:30:33,200
I know what you are, a man made
from the parts of others.

1649
01:30:33,234 --> 01:30:34,936
Yes.

1650
01:30:34,969 --> 01:30:37,038
This is where those parts
came from.

1651
01:30:37,071 --> 01:30:38,673
About a year ago
this young doctor

1652
01:30:38,706 --> 01:30:41,142
gave me a bag of gold
for some dead bodies.

1653
01:30:41,175 --> 01:30:44,011
Well, parts of them,
anyways.

1654
01:30:44,045 --> 01:30:46,914
You are the one
who found me?

1655
01:30:46,948 --> 01:30:49,517
It's not so strange a thing,
medical students

1656
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:51,786
paying for fresh corpses.

1657
01:30:51,819 --> 01:30:55,222
I am alive
because of you.

1658
01:30:55,256 --> 01:30:57,525
I suppose so.

1659
01:30:57,558 --> 01:31:00,594
I always thought of the doctor
as my father.

1660
01:31:02,863 --> 01:31:03,998
Alright.

1661
01:31:04,031 --> 01:31:06,600
Does that make you
my mother?

1662
01:31:13,607 --> 01:31:15,810
Christ, I'm glad
I didn't have to nurse you.

1663
01:31:20,014 --> 01:31:22,917
I will miss you
greatly then.

1664
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:25,987
You wouldn't have to miss me
if you just stayed, damn it.

1665
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:29,890
Kurt, I have a soul now.

1666
01:31:29,924 --> 01:31:34,128
I did not then, but I do now,
because of you.

1667
01:31:36,597 --> 01:31:38,299
I don't give out souls,
Anton.

1668
01:31:38,332 --> 01:31:42,603
I just helped you recognize it
for what it was.

1669
01:31:42,636 --> 01:31:45,639
You have given me so much.

1670
01:31:45,673 --> 01:31:47,108
Thank you.

1671
01:32:16,003 --> 01:32:18,305
Goodbye, lummox.

1672
01:32:18,339 --> 01:32:20,107
Goodbye, my friend.

1673
01:32:33,621 --> 01:32:35,322
Just watch over him,
alright?
