1
00:00:04,802 --> 00:00:07,302
(funky music)

2
00:00:24,831 --> 00:00:28,095
(Roy sniffing)

3
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:31,012
(knocking on door)

4
00:00:32,181 --> 00:00:33,079
- How do I look?

5
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:34,079
- Fabulous.

6
00:00:36,747 --> 00:00:38,630
- [Roy] Hello, ladies.

7
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,880
- [Ginger] May we come in?

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,713
- [Roy] Why not?

9
00:00:49,547 --> 00:00:52,840
And to what do I owe this pleasure?

10
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,840
- We're a welcome to LA gift
basket from Uncle A. (giggles)

11
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,743
- Uncle A sure out done himself this time.

12
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,630
You ladies feel free to help yourself

13
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,080
to any of the party material.

14
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,000
(Roy sniffs)

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,530
- Um, no thanks, we're on duty.

16
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,830
- [Roy] She gonna join us?

17
00:01:13,977 --> 00:01:17,343
- Hmm, not just yet, she's training.

18
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,640
- What's your name, honey?

19
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,383
- Ginger.

20
00:01:23,392 --> 00:01:26,776
- (chuckles) Ginger.

21
00:01:26,776 --> 00:01:28,220
You're killing me.

22
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,103
- Mm, that's what they all say.

23
00:01:32,033 --> 00:01:34,590
- Whoa, you're strong!

24
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,530
What have they been feeding
you down there, Ginger?

25
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,640
- They got me on an all meat diet, Roy,

26
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,393
with the occasional protein shake.

27
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,870
- How'd you know I like this?

28
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,074
- I know that you're a bad boy

29
00:01:49,074 --> 00:01:50,390
and you need to be punished.

30
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,870
- Why don't you come over
here and sit on my face

31
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:56,450
and tell me what a bad boy I am?

32
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,663
- You're the boss, Roy.

33
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,460
- What the fuck?

34
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,613
That Uncle A's a fucking bastard.

35
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,713
I'm gonna kill him.

36
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,733
Man, he got me good.

37
00:02:11,781 --> 00:02:14,110
Whoa, whoa, whoa, jokes over.

38
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:14,943
- [Ginger] Coco?

39
00:02:16,572 --> 00:02:17,880
- This shit ain't funny no more.

40
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,380
- I believe he mentioned something to me

41
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,773
about sitting on your
face, didn't he, Coco?

42
00:02:21,773 --> 00:02:23,140
(funky music)

43
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,732
- Wait now, enough's enough, enough's--

44
00:02:25,732 --> 00:02:28,232
(Roy mumbles)

45
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,287
- Coco, could you order some daiquiris?

46
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,140
- We'd like two daiquiris, please.

47
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,880
What kind do you have?

48
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,483
Hold on please.

49
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,860
They have mango daiquiris.

50
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,407
Mango it is, thank you.

51
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,414
Ginger?

52
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:01,247
- Hm?

53
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,353
- I think you're finished.

54
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,413
- Oh, duh.

55
00:03:10,646 --> 00:03:13,229
(Ginger sighs)

56
00:03:19,342 --> 00:03:22,009
(Ginger sniffs)

57
00:03:25,499 --> 00:03:27,999
(Coco sniffs)

58
00:03:34,668 --> 00:03:35,618
(energetic music)

59
00:03:35,618 --> 00:03:37,201
- Oh, it's dancing!

60
00:06:15,882 --> 00:06:18,647
(light Oriental music)

61
00:06:18,647 --> 00:06:21,083
You know, my birthday's coming up soon.

62
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,100
- No it's not, actually we just celebrated

63
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,070
your birthday last month.

64
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,270
In fact, that's the third time

65
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,320
we've celebrated your birthday this year.

66
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,870
- How many more shopping days
are there until Christmas?

67
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,760
- What do you want, Coco?

68
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,500
- Nothing, I'm just making small talk.

69
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,333
- Coco?

70
00:06:41,048 --> 00:06:44,370
- Lemona Blarnekeys has just
come out with a new shoe.

71
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,425
- You already have three
pairs of Lemona Blarnekeys,

72
00:06:47,425 --> 00:06:49,225
and you know how expensive they are.

73
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,263
- They are not for me.

74
00:06:51,263 --> 00:06:52,333
- Well who are they for?

75
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,020
- Oh, you're kidding, right?

76
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,293
- You have to see them, Ginger.

77
00:06:57,293 --> 00:06:59,680
They're this darling
little Lemona Blarnekeys,

78
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,480
masterpieces, handmade,
exclusively for Lovely Linda.

79
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,800
Please, Ginger?

80
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,650
It's a limited once in a lifetime release.

81
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,040
- No.
- They're very rare

82
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,110
and hard to get.

83
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,590
- No.
- Destined to become

84
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,910
a collector's item.

85
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,670
- Um, no.

86
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,740
- Please?

87
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,060
- You know, your little
Lovely Linda collection?

88
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,660
It's turning into quite the obsession.

89
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,090
- It's just a hobby.

90
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,513
It's perfectly normal and healthy.

91
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:29,477
- Fine, I'll look into it, hmm?

92
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,000
- Look into what?

93
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,267
- The Lemona Blarnekeys.

94
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:35,823
- Oh, I love you, Ginger.

95
00:07:37,066 --> 00:07:39,499
- [Ginger] I love you too, Coco.

96
00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:41,627

00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,172

Man this, this is a big shower.

103
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,540
Only jails have big showers like this.

104
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,693
I, I hate big showers.

105
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,520
High schools, they uh,
they have big showers,

106
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,013
but uh, guys bathing with
guys, that's just not right.

107
00:08:09,633 --> 00:08:10,683
How you doing, Bobby?

108
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:14,830
It was good work you done with Roy.

109
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,288
- Yeah, Uncle A is pleased.

110
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,158
I hope you're ready for more work.

111
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:21,158
It's gonna get really hairy around here.

112
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:26,350
Anyway, we just want
to give you a heads up,

113
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:31,350
'cause um, Uncle A's been
acting stranger than usual.

114
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,960
- Stranger than usual?

115
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,483
He's a fucking loon.

116
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,783
What, I'm just saying.

117
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:39,791
I think it's the syphilis.

118
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:40,810
- Tony!
- That shit eats

119
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:43,220
away at your brain, like Caligula.

120
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,053
- Tony!

121
00:08:44,053 --> 00:08:44,886
- I'm just saying.

122
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,450
It was funny what you done with his eyes?

123
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,647
- What're you talking about?

124
00:08:49,647 --> 00:08:50,903
- You know, his eyes?

125
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,350
- Don't mind him, Bobby.

126
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,183
Let's go.

127
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:57,342
- What, what?

128
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,263
- Damnit, where's my shot?

129
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,390
You know I can't think
straight without it.

130
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:15,533
Anthony, Tony, get over here right away!

131
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,743
I need my shot.

132
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,460
- Did you get his medicine?

133
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,391
- No, what're we gonna do?

134
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:25,224
- Shit.

135
00:09:26,211 --> 00:09:30,300
Ah, easy, Uncle A, calm down.

136
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,650
I got your shot right here.

137
00:09:39,258 --> 00:09:40,633
- (growls) Dammit.

138
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:51,090
Okay, so where were we?

139
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,593
- We were nowhere, we just got here.

140
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,833
- Roy, I've been thinking about Roy.

141
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:04,920
I want that son of a bitch
dead, do you understand me?

142
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,583
D-E-D, dead.

143
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,780
- He is dead, Bobby killed him.

144
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,613
- Roy's dead?

145
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:17,099
Eh.

146
00:10:18,263 --> 00:10:19,140
Well then we should send some flowers

147
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,350
to the funeral, something nice.

148
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,193
- I'll uh, I'll send some tulips.

149
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,203
- Tulips?

150
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,513
No tulips!

151
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,120
Roses, roses are for funerals.

152
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,120
Tulips are for, I dunno what
the hell tulips are for.

153
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:41,349
But no tulips, do you understand me?

154
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,120
- I, I like tulips.

155
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,990
- Tulips are stupid, you moron.

156
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:50,240
- No tulips, Uncle A,
we'll make a note of that.

157
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,753
Now what's next for Bobby?

158
00:10:53,132 --> 00:10:54,133
I've got him standing by.

159
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,140
- Oh yeah, get that Bobby over here.

160
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:01,480
He's the only one around here
with any balls, besides me.

161
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,360
- He's right here, Uncle A.

162
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,193
- Okay.

163
00:11:05,535 --> 00:11:06,980
Have him take care of Roy.

164
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,840
- Roy?

165
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,390
- Not Roy, you moron, Roy's dead.

166
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,363
Pay attention!

167
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:18,100
I want Louie dead.

168
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,910
- It's Louie, you're sure?

169
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,980
- Sure I'm sure.

170
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:29,850
I may be getting on, but I ain't crazy.

171
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:33,231
(suspenseful music)

172
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,650
- He's getting loopier and loopier.

173
00:11:40,043 --> 00:11:41,571
What'd Louie do to him?

174
00:11:41,571 --> 00:11:43,973
- Oh, who knows, who cares?

175
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,363
It's easier to have people
killed than to ask questions.

176
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,434
I'll call you with the details.

177
00:12:00,434 --> 00:12:01,267
- Right.

178
00:12:06,331 --> 00:12:11,174
- (sighs) I just wish he'd
die so I could take over.

179
00:12:11,174 --> 00:12:12,470
- You take over?

180
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,637
What about, what about me?

181
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:19,140
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

182
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,293
- Shut the fuck up.

183
00:12:21,576 --> 00:12:24,119
(mellow music)

184
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:27,140
(knocking on door)

185
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,760
- That's Bobby.

186
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,593
- Loopy.

187
00:12:30,756 --> 00:12:32,530
- Now Coco, you be nice to him.

188
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,370
- He's the one that's not nice.

189
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,383
- Coco.

190
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,108
- All right, I'll be nice.

191
00:12:39,108 --> 00:12:41,691
(Ginger sighs)

192
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,486
- You look great, Ginger.

193
00:12:52,486 --> 00:12:53,319
- I know.

194
00:12:59,707 --> 00:13:01,193
- What's the matter, baby?

195
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:04,463
- What the hell did you do to Roy's eyes?

196
00:13:05,436 --> 00:13:07,773
- Oh, that.

197
00:13:07,773 --> 00:13:08,731
Well that was Coco.

198
00:13:08,731 --> 00:13:09,564
(Coco giggles)

199
00:13:09,564 --> 00:13:10,397
- It's not funny.

200
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,260
They almost tripped me up because of that.

201
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,910
You need to tell me these things.

202
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,660
I need to know all the
details on each job.

203
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,133
- Of course you do, sweetie.

204
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,723
Let me get you a drink, all right?

205
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,203
- Why you always here?

206
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,470
Can't you give Ginger
and me a minute of peace?

207
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,420
- You know, Lovely Linda has just come out

208
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,520
with a new Bobby doll.

209
00:13:44,497 --> 00:13:45,483
Do you wanna see it?

210
00:13:46,517 --> 00:13:49,997
"Hi, I'm Bobby, and I'm a giant ass."

211
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,020
- What kinda freak plays
with dolls at your age?

212
00:13:54,857 --> 00:13:57,110
- (sighs) You sound just like my papi.

213
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,490
He always yell at me for
playing with Lovely Linda dolls.

214
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,190
If you're gonna play with dolls,

215
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,272
at least play with a guy doll.

216
00:14:04,272 --> 00:14:05,900
And you know what I thought?

217
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,103
Like most men, Steve has no balls.

218
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,140
So, if I'm gonna be a
person with no balls,

219
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,010
I'd rather be Lovely Linda.

220
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,593
She's so much more glamorous.

221
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,743
- Ginger!

222
00:14:20,112 --> 00:14:20,945
- Yes, sweetie?

223
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,563
- Um, Coco, do you mind terribly?

224
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,853
- No, I'll be in my room.

225
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,360
- Oh honey, you need to relax.

226
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,790
- I'm under a lot of pressure, Ginger.

227
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,320
Every time I go in there to
meet Uncle A and the boys,

228
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,920
I'm putting my life on the line.

229
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,623
- I know.

230
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,260
- And I'm doing it for us.

231
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,073
- I know.

232
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:05,750
- I mean, what if they find
out that I'm not the killer?

233
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,910
What if they find out
that you're the killer?

234
00:15:10,094 --> 00:15:12,660
And what if they find
out about you, and us?

235
00:15:16,613 --> 00:15:18,170
(Ginger speaks in foreign language)

236
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,170
- What the hell does that mean?

237
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:22,170
- Shh.
- Ginger, I'm serious.

238
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,433
- You want me to have
the operation, don't you?

239
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:28,555
- I want you to be happy, Ginger.

240
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:32,763
I want us to be happy, together.

241
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,123
I think getting the operation's
the right way to get there.

242
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,360
- Fine then, it's settled, you want--

243
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,910
- We.
- We.

244
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,400
We want me to get the operation,

245
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,100
and this is a quick and easy way

246
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,583
for us to get the money to do it.

247
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,790
(Bobby chuckles)

248
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:57,183
- You're right, Ginger, as usual.

249
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,030
- Then it's settled.

250
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,413
I'll keep working,

251
00:16:03,413 --> 00:16:07,410
and afterwards we're
all gonna be very happy.

252
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,650
You and me--

253
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,070
- Don't even say her name.

254
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,573
This is about the two of us, no Coco.

255
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,613
Do you see what I mean?

256
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,203
She always starts it.

257
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,900
- Listen, sweetie you look tired.

258
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,180
Why don't you go home tonight
and get some rest, okay?

259
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,173
Everything will look
better in the morning.

260
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,130
- Oh, there's another job coming up.

261
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,780
I'll let you know where and when.

262
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,523
- Fine.

263
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,230
Do I get a kiss or what?

264
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,890
Goodnight, sweetie.

265
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,890
- Goodnight, Ginger.

266
00:17:03,778 --> 00:17:05,670
(door shuts)

267
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,833
- Coco.

268
00:17:07,904 --> 00:17:09,840
(light music)

269
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,143
- I'm sorry, Coco, but Bobby,

270
00:17:13,035 --> 00:17:15,830
who I have no idea why
I like and can't fathom

271
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:19,083
why any woman would date
him, doesn't like you.

272
00:17:20,587 --> 00:17:23,220
But what about you and me, Ginger?

273
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,150
I don't like you, either.

274
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,083
In fact, I hate you.

275
00:17:28,154 --> 00:17:30,860
You must go out and live
alone in the streets,

276
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,040
where you will eventually
die of loneliness.

277
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,590
Oh, Ginger!

278
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,763
- Oh please.

279
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,143
You are such a drama queen.

280
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,530
You know I would never leave you.

281
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,363
- I know.

282
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:52,100
- (scoffs) Between you and Bobby,

283
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,530
I think I've had enough for one night.

284
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,520
- I'm sorry, Ginger.

285
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,500
We should probably get high now.

286
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,550
- We probably should.

287
00:18:01,112 --> 00:18:04,945
(singing in foreign language)

288
00:18:11,234 --> 00:18:13,984
(eclectic music)

289
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,123
- Ginger, we're going to be late.

290
00:18:35,978 --> 00:18:38,395
(holy music)

291
00:18:41,268 --> 00:18:42,935
- What do you think?

292
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,093
- Ginger, I think it's a bit much.

293
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,230
Perfect!

294
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,730
Oh, I have a surprise for you.

295
00:19:00,026 --> 00:19:01,970
- What the hell is that?

296
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,250
- It's a tribal blow dart
gun with poison darts.

297
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,843
I made it just for you.

298
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,010
- Are you sure that thing'll work?

299
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,633
- Of course I'm sure.

300
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:17,043
I got the recipe from
a very reliable source.

301
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,813
- What source?

302
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,500
- A lovely college student
I met in the internet.

303
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:27,423
Anyway, I made the poison with
love, so I know it will work.

304
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:30,493
- (sighs) I dunno.

305
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,400
- Ginger, you need to
expand your repertoire,

306
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,193
and blow darts are very exotic.

307
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,060
- Don't you think it'll
clash with my outfit?

308
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:44,463
- Hmm, you're right, we'll
use it some other time.

309
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,283
- Come on!

310
00:19:50,852 --> 00:19:52,355
(birds chirping)

311
00:19:52,355 --> 00:19:55,035
(upbeat music)

312
00:19:55,035 --> 00:19:57,240
And remember to look out for cops.

313
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,780
- Ginger?
- Hm?

314
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,880
- I am a professional.

315
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:03,020
- Of course you are, sweetie.

316
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,979
- Ginger?

317
00:20:05,979 --> 00:20:06,970
- Hm?

318
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,020
- Do you think it's wrong to kill people?

319
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,663
- No.

320
00:20:13,956 --> 00:20:18,956
- Okay, okay.

321
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,163
- (gasps) There he is,
red carnation, we're on!

322
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,390
- Louie Spashachesky?

323
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:40,043
You have been deemed a sinner,
and for that you must atone.

324
00:20:52,643 --> 00:20:55,476
(tires squealing)

325
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,333
(flesh squelches)

326
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,483
- Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead!

327
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,653
They're dropping like flies.

328
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:40,560
You know who's responsible?

329
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,393
Me!

330
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,880
I'm in charge.

331
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,670
You know how you kill a fly?

332
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:49,620
- Well, you could use a fly
swatter or a bug zapper,

333
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,920
or one of those sticky
things that looks like

334
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,270
a roll of film that you hang

335
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,443
from the ceiling, or you could--

336
00:22:54,443 --> 00:22:58,113
- Shut up, numb nuts, that's
not how you kill a fly.

337
00:22:59,355 --> 00:23:02,123
No, you gotta rip its wings off,

338
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:06,444
then you watch it flutter around a little

339
00:23:06,444 --> 00:23:07,794
until there's no hope left.

340
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:14,203
Then ya crush its tiny little
head until it explodes.

341
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,144
(phone rings)

342
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:21,563
- Yeah?

343
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,460
It's for you.

344
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,943
- Who else would it be for?

345
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,870
Hello?

346
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,170
- [Richie] Hello, Uncle A.

347
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:42,433
- Get lost.

348
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,013
Hey Richie, how's it going?

349
00:23:58,087 --> 00:23:59,610
- [Richie] You tell me.

350
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:03,200
First Roy, then Louie, it
seems all of our partners

351
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,890
are experiencing untimely deaths.

352
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:08,160
- Yeah, I heard about that.

353
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,433
It's a fucking shame.

354
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,310
Bad luck is what it is, Richie.

355
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,084
- [Richie] I hope you're
right, because greed

356
00:24:15,084 --> 00:24:16,634
is a terrible thing, my friend.

357
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,010
- Take it easy, Richie.

358
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:22,190
Tell everybody to just stay calm.

359
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:24,820
Look, the deal's the
same as it was before,

360
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,623
only now we don't have
as many mouths to feed.

361
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,894
- [Richie] I hope you're right, old man.

362
00:24:31,894 --> 00:24:33,311
I'll be in touch.

363
00:24:34,395 --> 00:24:36,978
(phone thumps)

364
00:24:43,677 --> 00:24:46,730
- Get me Bobby, I need people dead!

365
00:24:50,844 --> 00:24:52,102
- Let's ride.

366
00:24:52,102 --> 00:24:54,685
(groovy music)

367
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,690
(water bubbling)

368
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:45,924
(Coco coughs)

369
00:26:45,924 --> 00:26:46,897
(door thumps)

370
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,330
- Bobby, baby.

371
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,970
- Ginger, we need to stop.

372
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:52,370
I can't handle this anymore.

373
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,680
It's been too many murders,

374
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,970
and the cops are hassling everyone.

375
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:59,493
I think I'm being followed.

376
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,843
Uncle A's crazy.

377
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:05,363
He keeps wanting more
and more people killed.

378
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,700
I keep thinking every
murder's gonna be the last,

379
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,444
and then there's someone
else he wants to get rid of.

380
00:27:11,444 --> 00:27:12,680
And Anthony and Tony?

381
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,710
I don't know if they're
starting to suspect something.

382
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,810
They keep asking me for
details about each murder,

383
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,243
how I did it, what happened.

384
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:22,280
It's all I can do to keep
from completely losing

385
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,140
it when I'm with them,

386
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,740
and now they want someone else killed.

387
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,840
I couldn't talk my way out of it.

388
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,910
I told them I wanted a break,

389
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,160
but he said I had to
get rid of one more guy.

390
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,520
Ginger, you don't understand.

391
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,370
I'm going through 40 hells over here.

392
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,820
So do this last job, baby, and that's it.

393
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:47,040
We're outta here, someplace nice.

394
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,033
Someplace safe where nobody knows us.

395
00:27:50,577 --> 00:27:51,677
I mean, we gotta stop.

396
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,950
It's gonna be the last hit.

397
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,410
- It's not the last hit,

398
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,355
we've got plenty more in the bedroom.

399
00:27:58,355 --> 00:27:59,188
(Ginger chuckles)

400
00:27:59,188 --> 00:28:02,063
- Damnit, Ginger, you promised
we'd be alone tonight.

401
00:28:03,646 --> 00:28:05,280
- We should go to Virginia Beach.

402
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,700
I hear it's great.

403
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,593
- We are not going to Virginia Beach.

404
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,570
- Virginia Beach is for lovers!

405
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,730
- Then take your dolls and go,

406
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,400
'cause I can tell you one thing.

407
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,550
Wherever Ginger and I
go, you're not coming.

408
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,100
You hear me, we're going alone.

409
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,870
Please tell her she can't
come, Ginger, please?

410
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,542
- Fine, I'll go to Virginia
Beach all by myself.

411
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:31,542
(suspenseful music)

412
00:28:40,078 --> 00:28:42,661
(Ginger sighs)

413
00:28:51,794 --> 00:28:54,600
- So what do you say, baby?

414
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,560
- Bobby, maybe--

415
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,800
- Ginger, please.

416
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,653
We gotta do one last hit, tonight.

417
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,170
- Oh, come on, don't worry
your pretty little head.

418
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,923
I will do the last hit, okay?

419
00:29:08,229 --> 00:29:11,120
And then we'll get the
hell outta here, I promise.

420
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,030
- Oh, there's one more thing.

421
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:12,940
- Hm?

422
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:16,373
- This guy's got a briefcase,
and Uncle A wants it, bad.

423
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,653
- Briefcase, no problem.

424
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,410
Have you seen the bong?

425
00:29:26,628 --> 00:29:29,073
- Oh man, sleep it off, Ginger.

426
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,320
I'll call ya later.

427
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,810
- Copy that.

428
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,380
(door thumps)

429
00:29:41,908 --> 00:29:44,658
(dramatic music)

430
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,610
You ready?

431
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,560
- I'm always ready.

432
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,452
- Now listen, we gotta kill him,

433
00:29:55,452 --> 00:29:56,883
and we gotta get his briefcase.

434
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,763
I just want everything to
go nice and easy, okay?

435
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,934
- There's just one thing, Ginger.

436
00:30:03,934 --> 00:30:04,767
- What?

437
00:30:04,767 --> 00:30:09,420
- We never, ever do nothing nice and easy.

438
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:11,843
- Let's kick it.

439
00:30:22,708 --> 00:30:25,291
(groovy music)

440
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,693
Don't move.

441
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,792
- Oh my god.

442
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:39,300
- Can I help you ladies?

443
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,603
- You can sit down, now.

444
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,340
- Have we met before?

445
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:51,080
I'm sure we have not,
because I would never forget

446
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,313
two beautiful faces such as yours.

447
00:30:54,912 --> 00:30:56,093
(glass tinkles)
(Ginger gasps)

448
00:30:56,093 --> 00:30:57,300
- What the hell was that?

449
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,300
Don't let him out of your sight.

450
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,820
- I wouldn't dream of it.

451
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,700
- Coco!

452
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,533
- Yes?

453
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,897
Yes, I'm fine, go and check on the noise.

454
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:19,303
- Coco, that's a lovely name.

455
00:31:21,117 --> 00:31:22,690
- Did anyone ever tell you--

456
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:24,350
- Yes.

457
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,390
- What's in the briefcase?

458
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,610
- Just a few collectables.

459
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:29,710
Would you care to see?

460
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,003
- Why not?

461
00:31:33,697 --> 00:31:34,530
- Please.

462
00:31:47,377 --> 00:31:50,044
(heart beating)

463
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:53,360
- Oh my god.

464
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,130
- You like this doll?

465
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,663
- You have the New Wave Lovely Linda doll?

466
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,370
- Yes, I do.

467
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:02,913
I understand these are quite rare.

468
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:08,270
- They were made in 1983, but
quickly recalled and destroyed

469
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,570
due to the parents' outrage.

470
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,760
There are only 10 New
Wave Lovely Linda dolls

471
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,913
known to exist.

472
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:17,493
It is the ultimate
Lovely Linda collectable.

473
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:21,010
- Would you care to hold it?

474
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,070
- May I?

475
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,453
- I insist.

476
00:32:27,369 --> 00:32:30,033
- (chuckles) I can't believe
I'm actually holding it.

477
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,613
- Coco?

478
00:32:35,483 --> 00:32:36,316
- Yes?

479
00:32:43,489 --> 00:32:46,980
- It was a stupid cat. (gasps)

480
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,823
Coco!

481
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,403
What happened?

482
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,653
- He collects Lovely Linda dolls.

483
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,033
- Coco, this is not a good thing.

484
00:33:12,582 --> 00:33:15,243
(phone rings)

485
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,990
- [Bobby's Voicemail] Hey,
this is Bobby, how you doing?

486
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,893
Leave a message.

487
00:33:19,923 --> 00:33:20,850
(phone beeps)

488
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:24,363
- Bobby, it's me, pick up the phone.

489
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,990
(sighs) All right, call me
back when you get this message.

490
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:34,503
- [Coco] No answer?

491
00:33:34,503 --> 00:33:36,043
- No, where could he be?

492
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,020
- Have a drink.

493
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,817
- No, I'm not in the mood, sweetie,

494
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:42,180
I have to get ahold of Bobby
before he talks to Uncle A.

495
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,580
This was exactly what I
was afraid of happening.

496
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,990
- I'm sorry, Ginger.

497
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,803
- No honey, it's not your fault.

498
00:33:48,803 --> 00:33:51,847
No, it was my job, I screwed things up.

499
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,050
- Do you wanna get high?

500
00:33:55,025 --> 00:33:56,350
- No.

501
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,680
- Let's go dancing.

502
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,368
- Honey, I have to get
in touch with Bobby.

503
00:34:00,368 --> 00:34:02,546
I don't want him to get
in trouble 'cause of me.

504
00:34:02,546 --> 00:34:03,940
- But why don't you go
over to his apartment

505
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,520
and wait for him?

506
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,673
- Well he um, he told me
never to go over there.

507
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,680
He thought it wouldn't be good if we were,

508
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,880
you know, seen together.

509
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:15,069
- Oh, Ginger.

510
00:34:15,069 --> 00:34:16,720
- Oh Coco, it's not that.

511
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,627
No, he just didn't want me
to be tied into the killings.

512
00:34:22,142 --> 00:34:23,593
- Well, if you wanna believe that, fine,

513
00:34:23,593 --> 00:34:25,910
but you know the real reason.

514
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:27,387
He is ashamed of you.

515
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:30,400
- No, he is not!

516
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,910
- Then why wouldn't he
want you coming over?

517
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:34,650
Why wouldn't he proudly show off

518
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:36,933
the most beautiful woman in town?

519
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,950
I'm sorry, Ginger, but
he is ashamed of you,

520
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:43,013
that's why he wants you
to get the operation.

521
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,247
- The operation was my idea.

522
00:34:46,247 --> 00:34:47,080
- Was it?

523
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,683
Have you even thought it through?

524
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:54,290
Ginger, you are beautiful
just the way you are,

525
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:56,513
and he should love you
just the way you are.

526
00:34:57,715 --> 00:34:59,827
I don't know, Coco, maybe you're right.

527
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:03,061
I don't know what to do, you
know, I love him so much.

528
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:04,683
I just wanna make him happy.

529
00:35:04,683 --> 00:35:06,963
- Even if it means butchering yourself?

530
00:35:09,504 --> 00:35:12,337
(Ginger shudders)

531
00:35:15,797 --> 00:35:18,297
(phone rings)

532
00:35:19,691 --> 00:35:21,880
Come on, Bobby, pick up the phone.

533
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,345
- [Bobby's Voicemail] Hey,
this is Bobby, how you doing?

534
00:35:24,345 --> 00:35:25,530
- Dammit.

535
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:26,593
- Ginger?
- Hm?

536
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,880
- If Lovely Linda were alive,

537
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,680
do you think that she would like me?

538
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,030
- I know she would, sweetie.

539
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,573
- Why don't you go to sleep
and dream happy dreams?

540
00:35:40,704 --> 00:35:45,310
- Mm, no, I'm too on edge,
I'm just gonna stay up

541
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,623
and give myself a facial.

542
00:35:48,036 --> 00:35:52,920
- Mm, don't worry, Ginger,
I look out for you.

543
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,600
- Yeah, but who's gonna
look out for Bobby?

544
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,720
- You remember when you used to come over

545
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,400
and play with my niece, little Angie?

546
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,927
She always came running home saying,

547
00:36:07,927 --> 00:36:11,253
"Bobby took my dolls, he
won't let me play with them."

548
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,930
You remember that?

549
00:36:15,202 --> 00:36:17,646
(light music)

550
00:36:17,646 --> 00:36:21,428
I always thought you were
gonna grow up to be a queer.

551
00:36:21,428 --> 00:36:23,300
(Tony laughs)

552
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:27,790
Imagine my surprise
when you, of all people,

553
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:31,480
turn out to be my number one enforcer.

554
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,513
So, you swear you killed Richie,

555
00:36:35,376 --> 00:36:37,693
but you don't know where the briefcase is?

556
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,250
- He looked dead when I left him.

557
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:44,177
- He looked dead?

558
00:36:44,177 --> 00:36:46,893
He was dead, and then he looked dead.

559
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:52,670
The only thing I'm sure about
is that you're full of shit,

560
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:56,090
which makes me wonder what
else you're lying about,

561
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:59,083
like whether or not
you got that briefcase.

562
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,419
- I'll take care of this, Uncle A.

563
00:37:04,419 --> 00:37:07,160
(chuckles) Hey, mister bigshot
ain't so big anymore, huh?

564
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,450
Mister tough guy, tough
guy ain't so tough anymore.

565
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:11,740
Mister mean killer man ain't
so mean anymore, is he?

566
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,820
- Okay, we get it, Tony.

567
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,501
Shut the fuck up.

568
00:37:15,501 --> 00:37:18,001
(phone rings)

569
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,533
- It's Richie.

570
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,813
- He must be calling from the grave.

571
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,140
- Hey, Richie, what's going on?

572
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:36,170
- [Richie] Now you have women
doing your dirty work for you?

573
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,840
- What women?

574
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,190
- [Richie] Please, Uncle A,
those two ladies you sent over

575
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,957
to kill me tonight.

576
00:37:41,957 --> 00:37:43,007
Bruto is quite angry.

577
00:37:43,919 --> 00:37:45,890
He wants revenge for
the unfortunate deaths

578
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:49,010
of Roy, Louie, Jojo, and Chan.

579
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,300
- [Bruto] We were supposed
to split everything

580
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,350
nice and even, and you
had to go and fuck us.

581
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,793
Well I'm gonna fuck you,
you little son of a bitch,

582
00:37:55,793 --> 00:37:57,640
when I take that fucking wheelchair

583
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,090
and shove it up your fucking
ass, you scumbag motherfucker.

584
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:02,683
- Guys, it wasn't me.

585
00:38:03,858 --> 00:38:05,170
I don't know who those broads are.

586
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:09,100
I'll look into it, then
we'll split up the stuff,

587
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,980
just like we planned, okay?

588
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,053
Just keep your eye on that briefcase.

589
00:38:15,107 --> 00:38:16,290
I'll take care of everything.

590
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,693
- [Bruto] I hope so,
Uncle A, for your sake.

591
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:22,116
(phone thumps)

592
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:28,213
- You had women doing our hits?

593
00:38:28,213 --> 00:38:31,400
(Bobby screams)
Women?

594
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,000
- What do you know about
these two broads, Bobby?

595
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,190
- It's a fucking embarrassment.

596
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,723
Women doing our hits?

597
00:38:37,698 --> 00:38:40,598
If word got out about this,
we'd never hear the end of it.

598
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:46,163
They'd carve up my empire like a dead pig!

599
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
We gotta do something about this.

600
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,912
We got to find these women.

601
00:38:53,912 --> 00:38:56,970
- Maybe one of these broads
is Bobby's girlfriend, huh?

602
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:58,320
Maybe they both are.

603
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,950
- Two girlfriends, wow.

604
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:04,150
- [Anthony] What do you know
about these two broads, Bobby?

605
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,830
Now would be a good time to start talking.

606
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:07,887
- Let's torture him.

607
00:39:10,365 --> 00:39:11,680
(stapler clicks)

608
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,980
- That's real intimidating, Tony.

609
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,830
Why don't you have him drink
some liquid paper next time.

610
00:39:21,254 --> 00:39:22,554
What's it gonna be, Bobby?

611
00:39:25,576 --> 00:39:27,640
(phone rings)

612
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,473
- Bobby?

613
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,143
Coco.

614
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,343
It's for you.

615
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:39,663
- This is Coco.

616
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,093
No way.

617
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,780
I am so there.

618
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,233
Thanks, I'll call you later.

619
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:52,310
Ginger, I have great news.

620
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:53,143
- What?

621
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:55,360
- Guess who's coming into town?

622
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,193
- Who?

623
00:39:57,935 --> 00:40:00,380
(lovely harp music)

624
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,333
Lovely Linda?

625
00:40:02,207 --> 00:40:04,810
(lovely harp music)

626
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,520
Lovely Linda on ice?

627
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,480
- Yes!

628
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,380
Can we go, can we go, can we go?

629
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,650
- It just gets better and better.

630
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,303
- You're still sad.

631
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:16,390
- I know something's wrong.

632
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,410
- Well he could be sleeping
or visiting his mother,

633
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,820
his phone doesn't work,
or he has laryngitis, or--

634
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,653
- Thanks, Coco.

635
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,503
- Anyway, I have just
the thing to cheer us up.

636
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,193
- Us?

637
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,280
- When you are sad, I am sad.

638
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,113
Don't move.

639
00:40:43,201 --> 00:40:45,701
(light music)

640
00:40:47,706 --> 00:40:51,130
- (gasps) Oh, that is beautiful.

641
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:52,380
- Have a finger sandwich.

642
00:40:58,762 --> 00:41:00,095
- Mm, delicious.

643
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,960
- Can never go wrong with a Dutch paprika.

644
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:09,400
Oh, I almost forgot the soap.

645
00:41:10,974 --> 00:41:14,987
- (gasps) Oh, I don't know,
do you think we should?

646
00:41:14,987 --> 00:41:16,302
- [Coco] I think we should.

647
00:41:16,302 --> 00:41:17,385
- Now?
- Now.

648
00:41:18,947 --> 00:41:20,785
- [Ginger] I'm not sure
if now is a good time.

649
00:41:20,785 --> 00:41:23,535
- [Coco] It's always a good time.

650
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:34,122
(both giggling)

651
00:41:38,368 --> 00:41:41,035
(cups tinkling)

652
00:41:48,753 --> 00:41:51,336
(Ginger sighs)

653
00:41:57,167 --> 00:41:59,150
Are you getting off yet?

654
00:41:59,150 --> 00:41:59,983
- No.

655
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:04,733
- How about now?

656
00:42:07,165 --> 00:42:08,415
- Give it time.

657
00:42:10,454 --> 00:42:11,287
- Okay.

658
00:42:17,027 --> 00:42:18,227
Are you getting off yet?

659
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,100
- Coco?

660
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,013
- Yes, Ginger?

661
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:35,380
- Do you see a large man
standing in front of us?

662
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,297
- Yes I do.

663
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,870
- This is some good acid.

664
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,103
Can we help you?

665
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:43,490
- Yeah, you can help me.

666
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,530
You can help me avenge my friends

667
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,900
by dying a slow, miserable bitch death.

668
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,073
But first you can tell me
where the fuck the doll is.

669
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:59,120
- There are two dolls standing
right in front of you, silly.

670
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,084
- The real doll!

671
00:43:01,084 --> 00:43:04,094
(dramatic music)

672
00:43:04,094 --> 00:43:05,347
- [Ginger] Don't you touch her.

673
00:43:07,264 --> 00:43:08,716
(man grunts)

674
00:43:08,716 --> 00:43:11,216
(punch thuds)

675
00:43:12,487 --> 00:43:16,513
- Now I've seen everything,
bitches trying to do hits.

676
00:43:18,549 --> 00:43:19,382
(Ginger moans)

677
00:43:19,382 --> 00:43:21,353
First I'm gonna get my hands on that doll,

678
00:43:22,286 --> 00:43:25,340
and then I'm gonna fuck you,
and then I'm gonna kill you,

679
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,647
and not necessarily in that order.

680
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:28,883
- You leave her alone!

681
00:43:28,883 --> 00:43:30,953
- Huh, maybe you know where the doll is.

682
00:43:37,694 --> 00:43:40,277
(dart whizzes)

683
00:43:41,295 --> 00:43:44,080
(man grunts)

684
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,580
You fucking bitch.

685
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,494
I'm gonna fucking kill you,

686
00:43:49,494 --> 00:43:51,333
you're gonna be so goddamned dead.

687
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:54,083
You don't know how, you know how,

688
00:43:55,777 --> 00:43:57,427
how fucking dead you're gonna be.

689
00:43:58,528 --> 00:43:59,695
What the fuck?

690
00:44:00,549 --> 00:44:02,800
The fuck's happening?

691
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,217
Is who fucking...

692
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:07,927
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

693
00:44:09,476 --> 00:44:14,476
Oh. (grunts)

694
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,850
(Ginger grunts)

695
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:18,303
- Jive ass turkey.

696
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:22,343
- I told you it would work.

697
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,250
I guess the poison took
awhile because he was so big.

698
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:30,740
- What'd a big goon like that
want with a Lovely Linda doll?

699
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:33,160
- Ginger, it's not a Lovely Linda doll,

700
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,273
it's the Lovely Linda doll.

701
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,790
- Really, how much is it worth?

702
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:41,923
- According to the Lovely
Linda Collectors Guide,

703
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:45,850
in mint condition in the box,
New Wave Lovely Linda doll

704
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:49,760
is worth about $11,000.

705
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,720
The one we have would
probably fetch about $9,000.

706
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,390
- $9,000 for a doll?

707
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:58,970
- It's worth so much more than that.

708
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:01,803
It is the ultimate
Lovely Linda collectable.

709
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:05,383
- Coco?

710
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:07,103
- Yes, Ginger?

711
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,298
- I'm starting to get off now.

712
00:45:10,298 --> 00:45:13,881
(intense electronic music)

713
00:45:44,634 --> 00:45:45,910
- I was.

714
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:46,743
- Yes.

715
00:45:47,855 --> 00:45:48,844
- Ginger?

716
00:45:48,844 --> 00:45:50,159
- Hmm?

717
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:51,409
- What do we do with him?

718
00:45:53,922 --> 00:45:56,170
- Don't worry about it,
I'll take care of it.

719
00:45:57,431 --> 00:46:00,014
(Ginger moans)

720
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:09,993
Let's go for a walk.

721
00:46:16,671 --> 00:46:19,210
- Hey ah, what happened to Bruto?

722
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,510
- I don't even wanna know.

723
00:46:22,284 --> 00:46:23,580
- Should we pick 'em up?

724
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,363
- No no no, let's follow
'em, see where they go first.

725
00:46:38,774 --> 00:46:40,060
Blonde's cute.

726
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:42,663
- I wouldn't kick either
of them outta bed.

727
00:46:42,663 --> 00:46:46,330
(intense electronica music)

728
00:47:47,776 --> 00:47:50,526
(dramatic music)

729
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,183
- I'm Moonji, and you are
two beautiful flowers.

730
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:57,863
Please, sit.

731
00:48:00,558 --> 00:48:04,307
Mm, you are both lost,
looking for love, hm?

732
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,400
Search no more.

733
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,850
You've heard of the wonderful powers

734
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:11,953
of Moonji's magic men-phrodisiac, huh?

735
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:17,250
And, hm, here it is.

736
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:22,250
Quite affordable, only $19.95
per bottle, two for $30.

737
00:48:24,409 --> 00:48:26,404
- Is it raspberry?

738
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:28,237
I love blue raspberry.

739
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,320
- That's not what we came for.

740
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:36,100
- Oh, I see.

741
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,857
Then how can Moonji be of assistance, hm?

742
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:44,113
Would you like to visit
loved ones of the past,

743
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:49,277
or do you dare to discover what
the future may possess, hm?

744
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:54,073
- Can you really contact the dead?

745
00:48:54,073 --> 00:48:56,627
- If that is what you wish, my child.

746
00:48:56,627 --> 00:48:58,527
- I would love to speak to Desi Arnaz.

747
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:00,863
- Desi Arnaz?

748
00:49:02,061 --> 00:49:05,490
The devilish handsome Cuban band leader?

749
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:07,716
- Yes, yes, can you contact him?

750
00:49:07,716 --> 00:49:09,973
- (chuckles) I wish.

751
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:13,550
Oh, no no no, I'm very sorry,

752
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:17,117
Moonji can only contact
close relatives and the like.

753
00:49:19,413 --> 00:49:21,223
- Moonji, tell us about our future.

754
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:27,080
- I see wonderful things in your future.

755
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,964
I see...

756
00:49:29,964 --> 00:49:33,163
(gasps) Oh, great one!

757
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:39,140
Oh, I see death and
betrayal and more death,

758
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:46,150
and, and tiny, tiny little shoes.

759
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:51,613
And death! (gasps)

760
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:57,243
- Same old, same old.

761
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:03,120
- Great Moonji, did you see
anything else in our future?

762
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,203
- Wait, wait.

763
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,340
Moonji sees something, oh yes.

764
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:15,340
After you have swam through
a terrible sea of blood,

765
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:21,560
oh yes, you will find
yourself on a great shore

766
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,250
filled with glowing, glowing sand.

767
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:33,930
- Ah, we're going to Virginia Beach.

768
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:35,363
What a great fortune!

769
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:38,360
Let's go home and try on bathing suits.

770
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:47,473
- Be careful.

771
00:50:50,062 --> 00:50:51,310
(Ginger chuckles)

772
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:52,473
- I'm tired.

773
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,940
We shouldn't have left the car running.

774
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,540
- I don't even remember driving.

775
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:05,930
- Hello, ladies.

776
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:07,430
- Hi.

777
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:10,000
- We're gonna take you
little ladies for a ride.

778
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,670
- Great, my feet are killing me.

779
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:14,870
- No thanks, we'll walk.

780
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:16,623
- I dunno, it might be fun.

781
00:51:18,772 --> 00:51:20,203
- [Ginger] What do you think, Coco?

782
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:23,490
- No, I don't think so.

783
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:24,903
He kisses kinda boring.

784
00:51:26,492 --> 00:51:28,060
(gun clicks)
- We weren't asking.

785
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:29,331
- Charming.

786
00:51:29,331 --> 00:51:32,081
(dramatic music)

787
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:37,639
(Anthony grunts)

788
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:39,604
- Ow!
- Anthony, Anthony,

789
00:51:39,604 --> 00:51:40,850
what should I do?
- Hit her!

790
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:42,580
- But, but, she's a girl!

791
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:43,680
- [Anthony] So what?

792
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,246
- Such gentlemen.

793
00:51:45,246 --> 00:51:48,163
(punches thudding)

794
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:51,840
How do I look?

795
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,873
- Fabulous.

796
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,523
- [Tony] I, I think I'm in love.

797
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:04,863
- Shut the fuck up.

798
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:11,928
- You know what I'm saying?

799
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:14,428
(light music)

800
00:52:15,673 --> 00:52:17,520
(Uncle A spits)

801
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:22,070
You can buy sunflower
seeds without the shells,

802
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:24,380
but they don't taste the same.

803
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,353
You wanna know why?

804
00:52:27,442 --> 00:52:32,442
'Cause you gotta earn the flavor. (spits)

805
00:52:33,005 --> 00:52:38,005
I mean, you gotta sit
here and chew and wrestle

806
00:52:39,361 --> 00:52:42,994
these little fuckers. (spits)

807
00:52:42,994 --> 00:52:45,077
Yeah, that's all the fun.

808
00:52:48,322 --> 00:52:53,322
You know what I'm saying? (spits)

809
00:52:53,574 --> 00:52:54,907
Gimme my coffee.

810
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,703
What the fuck is this
stuff floating on the top?

811
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,760
How the hell do you serve
me something like this?

812
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,770
What are you, some kind of fucking animal?

813
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:13,393
Here, here, take it back,
make it right. (grunts)

814
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:26,133
The dynamic duo returns.

815
00:53:30,575 --> 00:53:33,454
What the, did Bruto do this to you?

816
00:53:33,454 --> 00:53:34,454
- No.
- Yeah.

817
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:37,880
- [Uncle A] Well, which is it?

818
00:53:38,836 --> 00:53:41,086
- No, Bruto didn't do this.

819
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,297
The girls took care of him.

820
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:49,390
(Uncle A grunts)

821
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:54,020
- Please, tell me you
were in a car accident,

822
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:55,580
then a piano fell on ya.

823
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:58,310
Tell me anything, except that two women

824
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:00,053
just beat the crap outta ya.

825
00:54:01,444 --> 00:54:02,277
- It's like this.

826
00:54:02,277 --> 00:54:05,273
- No, I'll tell you like it is.

827
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,690
You just got your asses
kicked by two girls,

828
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:14,690
so no story, no excuses, nothing
is gonna erase that fact.

829
00:54:17,178 --> 00:54:19,078
- But they were really, really strong.

830
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:23,980
- Come on, Uncle A,
give us another chance.

831
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:27,834
- What's worse than
getting beat up by a woman?

832
00:54:27,834 --> 00:54:30,473
Getting beat up by a woman twice!

833
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:38,730
Richie is coming by tomorrow
night to settle a little score,

834
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:45,799
huh, and I don't want those
bitches getting in the way.

835
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:49,113
I'm bringing in some outside help.

836
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Get me Mr. Fly on the phone.

837
00:54:57,571 --> 00:54:59,571
He'll take care of this.

838
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:03,432
(Uncle A sneezes)

839
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,840
Maybe then we'll get some fucking dignity

840
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,952
back in this family.

841
00:55:11,952 --> 00:55:14,952
(upbeat horn music)

842
00:55:47,895 --> 00:55:50,645
(birds chirping)

843
00:55:51,798 --> 00:55:54,381
(Ginger moans)

844
00:55:57,645 --> 00:56:00,113
- (yawns) Where are we?

845
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:05,633
- We're in our car.

846
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,860
- [Coco] Where is our car?

847
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,093
- I have no idea.

848
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,300
- How did we get in our car?

849
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:18,433
- Coco, please.

850
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:21,630
- Let's go home, Ginger.

851
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:22,853
I need a shower.

852
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:26,283
And my makeup.

853
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,970
- I don't think that'll
be a good idea right now.

854
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,810
Well between that large ape
who tried to kill us last night

855
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:35,730
and those two idiots in the alley,

856
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:37,830
I'd say someone was after us.

857
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:41,980
- That means we are
hunted, and we are homeless

858
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:45,043
and must now fend for ourself
in this cold, dark city.

859
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,923
- Something like that, Coco.

860
00:56:48,923 --> 00:56:49,870
(phone rings)

861
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:50,703
Hello?

862
00:56:51,806 --> 00:56:53,563
(sighs) Bobby, where have you been?

863
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:57,160
- Ah, my aunt got real sick
and I had to take my mom

864
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,440
over there to take care of her,

865
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,150
and she didn't have a
phone, so I couldn't call,

866
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:05,900
and uh, I couldn't leave because
I thought she was gonna die

867
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,000
and I wanted to be there for it, you know?

868
00:57:09,390 --> 00:57:11,190
Anyway, that's why I haven't called.

869
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,920
- Oh, thank god, Bobby, I thought
something happened to you.

870
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,603
I guess you heard about
that hit I bungled.

871
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,350
- [Bobby] Yeah, I heard.

872
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:24,673
- Baby, I miss you.

873
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:29,760
- [Bobby] Ginger, I need
you to do another hit.

874
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,450
- Bobby, I don't think now's a good time,

875
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:33,183
there's a lot of weird
stuff happening and--

876
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:36,130
- [Bobby] Listen, I can't
talk right now, okay?

877
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:39,810
This last job is gonna make
all that weird stuff go away.

878
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:41,963
I promise, okay?

879
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:43,920
- Okay.

880
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,000
- [Bobby] I'll call you later.

881
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,243
- Bobby, I love you!

882
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:57,673
- [Both] Aww!

883
00:58:01,033 --> 00:58:03,616
(Ginger sighs)

884
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,760
- I'm so happy.

885
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:10,593
- I'm not.

886
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:12,913
We need new clothes.

887
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,353
- We'll go shoplifting, my treat.

888
00:58:21,985 --> 00:58:24,735
(dramatic music)

889
00:58:32,281 --> 00:58:33,114
How do I look?

890
00:58:33,114 --> 00:58:34,130
- Fabulous.

891
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:35,740
- And I feel fabulous.

892
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:38,760
You said everything would be
fine, and you were right, Coco.

893
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:41,090
- I was just trying to make
you feel better, Ginger.

894
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:44,263
Honestly, I thought Bobby was dead.

895
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:48,710
I'm surprised he didn't get into trouble.

896
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:50,520
- Hmm, well I'm sure he'll explain

897
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,710
everything to me over dinner.

898
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:54,340
Um, Coco?

899
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:57,060
- Don't worry, I won't be around tonight

900
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:58,343
to cramp your style.

901
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:02,423
- You're a doll, Coco, but
that's not what I meant.

902
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:05,850
Would you mind staying in the car?

903
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:10,060
- What, why?

904
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:11,040
- I'll just be a minute,

905
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,120
there's no point in us
both going in there,

906
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,500
and I need you to keep a look out.

907
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,210
- But we're a team!

908
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:18,670
- Well of course we are, sweetie,

909
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:20,623
I just want things to go smoothly.

910
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,410
- What you're really
saying is you don't want

911
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:26,520
me around to screw things up.

912
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,950
- I never said that.

913
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:29,000
- You didn't have to.

914
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:30,960
- Coco.

915
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,513
- Superwoman never left
Supergirl in the car.

916
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:37,340
- Well actually I don't think
that there was a Superwoman.

917
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,670
Maybe you're thinking of Wonder Woman.

918
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:40,850
- Don't tell me what I'm thinking.

919
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:43,723
Didn't you just adore Wonder
Woman Power Bracelets?

920
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:48,860
Fine, go off all by yourself
and have all the fun.

921
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:50,860
The ugly stepsister will just sit at home

922
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:52,953
while Cinderella has fun at the ball.

923
00:59:55,473 --> 00:59:57,650
- (snorts) I'll be right back.

924
00:59:57,650 --> 00:59:59,100
- I might be waiting for you.

925
01:00:00,834 --> 01:00:02,490
Ginger?

926
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:03,323
- Yes?

927
01:00:04,882 --> 01:00:07,013
- (sighs) Good luck.

928
01:00:15,518 --> 01:00:19,101
(upbeat electronica music)

929
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:30,820
- I poured you one.

930
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:35,497
- I think you were expecting someone else.

931
01:00:35,497 --> 01:00:40,497
- Oh, I always expect a
beautiful young lady to appear.

932
01:00:47,485 --> 01:00:49,720
(chuckles) I'd offer
you some strawberries,

933
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:54,720
but I can see that your hands are full.

934
01:01:08,204 --> 01:01:09,893
Feeling a little tired?

935
01:01:09,893 --> 01:01:12,393
Would you like to lay
down on the sofa, relax?

936
01:01:13,894 --> 01:01:15,503
- (sniffs) Did you drug this?

937
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:19,173
- Oh, I might have slipped
in a mickey or two.

938
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:24,351
- (laughs) That's cute,
except I have one of these

939
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:26,768
for breakfast, every morning.

940
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:34,363
You have quick hands.

941
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:36,573
- So I've been told.

942
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:40,840
- Should I dive for
the gun, or should you?

943
01:01:42,724 --> 01:01:44,024
- I just bought this suit.

944
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:51,233
But maybe we can settle
this some other way.

945
01:01:53,707 --> 01:01:56,633
- Oh, (gasps) oh, maybe we can.

946
01:02:06,007 --> 01:02:08,757
(Mr. Fly laughs)

947
01:02:15,905 --> 01:02:18,488
(groovy music)

948
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:28,350
Here, wouldn't want you to
mess up that pretty face.

949
01:02:41,808 --> 01:02:44,641
(sabres clinking)

950
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:14,457
(Ginger grunts)

951
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,623
- Ooh, man that Bobby
was a fool to let you go.

952
01:03:20,534 --> 01:03:22,569
- What the hell does Bobby
have to do with this?

953
01:03:22,569 --> 01:03:26,347
- Nothing, no, it's about you and me!

954
01:03:26,347 --> 01:03:29,180
(sabres clinking)

955
01:03:33,153 --> 01:03:35,903
(Mr. Fly groans)

956
01:03:38,298 --> 01:03:40,715
(kick thuds)

957
01:03:51,365 --> 01:03:52,198
- I,

958
01:03:54,389 --> 01:03:57,889
I, I can't think of anything witty to say.

959
01:04:05,386 --> 01:04:06,219
- Coco.

960
01:04:12,298 --> 01:04:14,881
(Ginger gasps)

961
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:28,904
(funky music)

962
01:04:31,050 --> 01:04:34,396
- This is one of the
broads that beat you up?

963
01:04:34,396 --> 01:04:37,630
- No, it's not her, Uncle A, it's Ginger.

964
01:04:37,630 --> 01:04:38,643
She's the tough one.

965
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:42,713
- So what happened to Mr. Fly?

966
01:04:46,117 --> 01:04:46,950
(Anthony sighs)

967
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:48,073
You're kidding me.

968
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:51,740
Okay, forget about that.

969
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:53,280
Now Richie's coming by here,

970
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,323
and I don't want anything
to mess up this exchange.

971
01:04:57,790 --> 01:04:58,690
Put her someplace.

972
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,843
- You have no chance of winning.

973
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:17,320
Ginger is a force unto herself,

974
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,020
a beautiful, deadly creature.

975
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:22,290
Capable of giving great
pleasure and great pain, she--

976
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:23,693
- All right, all right.

977
01:05:25,224 --> 01:05:27,560
We get it, she's fucking Superwoman.

978
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:30,357
- Actually, actually
there wasn't a Superwoman.

979
01:05:30,357 --> 01:05:31,975
It was another character.

980
01:05:31,975 --> 01:05:33,423
- (groans) Shut up!

981
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:36,703
God, I need some air.

982
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,673
Watch her!

983
01:05:41,858 --> 01:05:44,775
(mysterious music)

984
01:05:46,879 --> 01:05:49,046
- [Richie] Hello, Uncle A.

985
01:05:50,876 --> 01:05:51,709
- Finally.

986
01:05:55,470 --> 01:05:57,519
- Did you get those two women?

987
01:05:57,519 --> 01:05:59,800
- Eh, we got one of them, but
don't worry about that now.

988
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:01,000
Let's split up the take.

989
01:06:05,349 --> 01:06:09,682
You know how long I've been
looking forward to this?

990
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:24,870
- What's the matter?

991
01:06:24,870 --> 01:06:25,983
- Where's the doll?

992
01:06:27,870 --> 01:06:32,650
Where's the New Wave Lovely Linda doll?

993
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:35,550
- Those two women who
tried to kill me have it.

994
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:37,723
What's the difference, we have the rest.

995
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:42,698
We got an easy 400
lives in that briefcase.

996
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:45,237
(Uncle A growls)

997
01:06:45,237 --> 01:06:46,737
- I want the doll!

998
01:06:48,353 --> 01:06:50,520
I want the New Wave Lovely Linda doll!

999
01:06:51,785 --> 01:06:54,689
(gunshots blasting)

1000
01:06:54,689 --> 01:06:57,272
The New Wave Lovely Linda doll!

1001
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,490
- I wish, I wish this
wasn't happening like this.

1002
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,440
I really think you're beautiful.

1003
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,113
- Really?

1004
01:07:12,106 --> 01:07:13,153
Mm, mm.

1005
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:15,660
- What's the matter?

1006
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:17,903
- I'm all cramped up from sitting so long.

1007
01:07:18,890 --> 01:07:21,000
My legs are killing me.

1008
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,390
- Do you want me to um--

1009
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:23,690
- Rub them?

1010
01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:24,905
Yes.

1011
01:07:24,905 --> 01:07:27,905
(lively jazz music)

1012
01:07:31,871 --> 01:07:33,204
Mm, that's nice.

1013
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:43,410
- Oh my god, you, you, you gotta--

1014
01:07:43,410 --> 01:07:44,700
- [Anthony] What's going on?

1015
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:47,610
- Nothing, nothing, I was,
I was just watching her

1016
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:48,510
like you told me to.

1017
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:50,530
I didn't, I didn't touch her or anything.

1018
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:51,640
A thing, I swear.

1019
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:52,473
- What happened?

1020
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,040
- She's transvestited.

1021
01:08:00,941 --> 01:08:01,774
- What?

1022
01:08:01,774 --> 01:08:03,213
- She's, she's, she's got a dick.

1023
01:08:08,008 --> 01:08:09,675
- You're kidding me.

1024
01:08:11,006 --> 01:08:12,250
Why would a beautiful blonde like that

1025
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:14,153
hang out with a transvestite?

1026
01:08:17,936 --> 01:08:18,769
Oh shit.

1027
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:24,653
If Uncle A or anybody finds
out about this, we are dead.

1028
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:28,000
It's bad enough two women,

1029
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,230
but two chicks with dicks, goddamnit.

1030
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:35,070
We tell no one.

1031
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:35,983
- No one.

1032
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:40,100
You know, I'll never
understand why a beautiful girl

1033
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:42,173
like that would go and get a dick.

1034
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,410
- You're retarded, you know that?

1035
01:08:47,079 --> 01:08:49,579
(door thumps)

1036
01:08:59,853 --> 01:09:00,686
- Ginger?

1037
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:04,713
- Surprised to see me alive?

1038
01:09:05,939 --> 01:09:08,220
(punch thuds)

1039
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:09,803
- It's nice to see you, too.

1040
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:14,453
Come on, grab some things,
let's get outta here.

1041
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:16,533
I'm sick of this place.

1042
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:19,940
Just think about it, you and me,

1043
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:22,903
sipping margaritas, watching the sunset.

1044
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:25,653
- Bobby, how could you?

1045
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:29,283
- I didn't have a choice.

1046
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:31,743
They made me do it.

1047
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:35,020
It's your fault.

1048
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:36,180
If you hadn't messed up that job,

1049
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:37,830
none of this would have happened.

1050
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:44,253
Come on, it's not like
I wanted to set you up.

1051
01:09:46,184 --> 01:09:49,203
I knew you could handle Mr.
Fly with your eyes closed.

1052
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:52,693
Come on, let's get outta here.

1053
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:55,303
- Where's Coco?

1054
01:09:56,497 --> 01:09:57,830
- I don't know.

1055
01:09:57,830 --> 01:10:00,514
- Where the hell is Coco?

1056
01:10:00,514 --> 01:10:01,943
- I don't know where she is.

1057
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:10,263
If I knew where she was,
I'd tell you, I swear.

1058
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:14,460
- What the hell is going on, Bobby?

1059
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:16,740
- I picked up a bit of a phone call here,

1060
01:10:16,740 --> 01:10:19,060
a bit of Uncle A's mumbling there.

1061
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:21,930
Turns out Uncle A set up a heist
with those guys you killed.

1062
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:24,010
They robbed some big time collector.

1063
01:10:24,010 --> 01:10:25,800
He had all sorts of old stuff.

1064
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:29,660
He had a Super Comics number
one in mint condition,

1065
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:33,740
a 1927 Sugar Shack Johnson rookie card.

1066
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:35,310
I mean, all that old stuff
is worth a lot of money,

1067
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:36,803
you know, a fortune.

1068
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:40,590
Anyways, I figured he wanted
all that stuff for himself,

1069
01:10:40,590 --> 01:10:42,790
and that's why he got
all those guys killed,

1070
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:44,603
but I was wrong.

1071
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:48,880
Turns out he just wanted a doll.

1072
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:49,713
- A doll?

1073
01:10:49,713 --> 01:10:51,823
- Yeah, some kind of New Wave doll?

1074
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:55,580
- New Wave Lovely Linda doll.

1075
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:58,243
- Yeah, you got it?

1076
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:00,833
- Yeah, I got it.

1077
01:11:01,913 --> 01:11:03,713
- Oh, baby that's sweet!

1078
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:07,490
All right, here's what we're gonna do.

1079
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:10,120
We're just gonna mail him the doll.

1080
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:13,400
He'll be so happy, he'll
forget all about us,

1081
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,353
and then it'll just be the two of us.

1082
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:17,163
What do you say?

1083
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:20,193
- What about Coco?

1084
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:21,873
- Fuck Coco!

1085
01:11:22,951 --> 01:11:25,451
(punch thuds)

1086
01:11:30,764 --> 01:11:34,700
- You know I can't believe you, Bobby.

1087
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:37,230
After all that I've done for you.

1088
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:40,527
God, I almost changed myself for you.

1089
01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:46,933
You know, I may not be perfect,

1090
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:51,120
but I'm damn good just the way I am.

1091
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,970
In fact, you could say that
I am the best of both worlds.

1092
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:57,513
It's a shame that you never realized that.

1093
01:11:58,622 --> 01:11:59,535
- Ginger.

1094
01:11:59,535 --> 01:12:02,404
(kick thuds)

1095
01:12:02,404 --> 01:12:04,904
(phone rings)

1096
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:08,510
- Coco?

1097
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:09,343
Coco!

1098
01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:13,690
Hello, Uncle A.

1099
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:19,640
Yes, I do, so don't hurt my
doll and I won't hurt yours.

1100
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:22,120
I'll be over in an hour.

1101
01:12:26,284 --> 01:12:29,367
(mellow organ music)

1102
01:12:59,741 --> 01:13:02,574
(energetic music)

1103
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:05,230
- Killing, killing,
killing women ain't right.

1104
01:14:05,230 --> 01:14:07,390
- Yeah well if you have any hesitation,

1105
01:14:07,390 --> 01:14:08,990
keep thinking about their dicks.

1106
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:11,260
- That's kinda gay, Anthony.

1107
01:14:13,657 --> 01:14:16,740
(upbeat Latin music)

1108
01:14:24,154 --> 01:14:26,737
(gun blasting)

1109
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:32,283
(singing in foreign language)

1110
01:14:42,668 --> 01:14:45,085
(gun blasts)

1111
01:14:47,259 --> 01:14:48,934
When, when, when should we jump in?

1112
01:14:48,934 --> 01:14:50,233
- Soon, very soon.

1113
01:14:52,069 --> 01:14:55,902
(singing in foreign language)

1114
01:15:01,141 --> 01:15:03,558
(gun blasts)

1115
01:15:35,439 --> 01:15:39,450
- Damnit, this is un-fucking-believable.

1116
01:15:39,450 --> 01:15:42,277
Anthony, Tony, kill her!

1117
01:15:43,719 --> 01:15:44,852
(gun blasts)

1118
01:15:44,852 --> 01:15:45,984
(mysterious music)

1119
01:15:45,984 --> 01:15:50,210
- (grunts) I didn't even
feel that, you dumb bitch.

1120
01:15:53,329 --> 01:15:58,057
Anthony, Tony, get her.

1121
01:16:08,825 --> 01:16:11,242
(gun blasts)

1122
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:19,338
- I give up, I give up!

1123
01:16:19,338 --> 01:16:21,010
I don't, I don't, I don't have a gun.

1124
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:22,103
You can't, you can't shoot me.

1125
01:16:23,261 --> 01:16:25,678
(gun blasts)

1126
01:16:31,395 --> 01:16:34,757
- Enough of this shit, where's the doll?

1127
01:16:34,757 --> 01:16:36,790
- The doll belongs to Coco.

1128
01:16:38,431 --> 01:16:39,431
- Oh really?

1129
01:16:40,647 --> 01:16:42,034
(gun blasts)

1130
01:16:42,034 --> 01:16:42,867
- Coco!

1131
01:16:45,130 --> 01:16:46,465
(gun blasts)

1132
01:16:46,465 --> 01:16:49,048
(gun clatters)

1133
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:52,120
- I want that doll!

1134
01:16:55,930 --> 01:16:57,223
I deserve that doll.

1135
01:17:04,570 --> 01:17:05,403
Please.

1136
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,763
Can I just hold it for a moment,

1137
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,593
I promise I won't bleed on it.

1138
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:18,403
Please, I want that doll.

1139
01:17:20,071 --> 01:17:21,800
(gun blasts)

1140
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:22,750
- Are you an angel?

1141
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:27,373
- I'm sorry, Coco, no.

1142
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:35,263
- Oh, Ginger.

1143
01:17:37,582 --> 01:17:40,232
- Oh don't worry darling,
everything's gonna be fine.

1144
01:17:41,350 --> 01:17:43,950
Tomorrow we'll buy Lovely
Linda a new pair of shoes.

1145
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:48,880
- The Lemona Blarnekeys?

1146
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,273
- The Lemona Blarnekeys.

1147
01:17:52,468 --> 01:17:55,943
- Oh Ginger, you are an angel.

1148
01:18:02,464 --> 01:18:03,400
- I cannot believe Uncle A went through

1149
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,323
all this trouble for a little doll.

1150
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:09,883
- Oh Ginger, he's a collector.

1151
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:18,810
(Coco shudders)

1152
01:18:18,810 --> 01:18:20,590
- Oh, Coco, oh my god!

1153
01:18:22,204 --> 01:18:24,063
Coco, Coco, Coco!

1154
01:18:26,308 --> 01:18:28,756
Coco!

1155
01:18:28,756 --> 01:18:31,362
Coco?

1156
01:18:31,362 --> 01:18:33,724
Coco?

1157
01:18:33,724 --> 01:18:37,194
Coco?

1158
01:18:37,194 --> 01:18:38,383
Coco?

1159
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,120
- Yes?

1160
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:43,370
- You haven't said a thing
about my new bathing suit.

1161
01:18:43,370 --> 01:18:45,133
How do I look?

1162
01:18:45,133 --> 01:18:46,050
- Fabulous.

1163
01:18:50,386 --> 01:18:53,219
(energetic music)

1164
01:21:05,982 --> 01:21:08,482
(happy music)

1165
01:22:10,261 --> 01:22:12,678
(gun blasts)
