00:00:50,353 --> 00:00:52,016
I bet the monster's done it.

6
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:54,001
The ones under my bed.

7
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:54,896
Did it, not done it.

8
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,400
And no, they didn't.

9
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:57,712
There's nothing under
your bed, baby doll,

10
00:00:57,744 --> 00:00:59,056
just a couple of quilts.

11
00:01:00,721 --> 00:01:02,865
I hear him under
there at night.

12
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,304
Scraps could hear him too.

13
00:01:04,336 --> 00:01:05,745
Hush now.

14
00:01:05,776 --> 00:01:06,992
We're going back to the house.

15
00:01:07,024 --> 00:01:07,793
Okay.

16
00:01:07,825 --> 00:01:08,625
Shoo.

[crow cawing]

18
00:01:18,672 --> 00:01:19,953
Keep Goldie in the house.

19
00:01:23,312 --> 00:01:25,392
I'm gonna take care of it.

30
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,769
I think that chair's
on its last leg.

31
00:03:12,784 --> 00:03:13,904
That makes two of us.

32
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:18,961
What are you
looking for out there?

33
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,297
Ghosts, I reckon.

00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:27,953
[child giggling]

35
00:03:27,985 --> 00:03:29,585
I think I found one.

36
00:03:34,896 --> 00:03:36,784
Who's under there? [laughs]

37
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,033
Did I scare you?

38
00:03:38,064 --> 00:03:38,993
Yes.

39
00:03:39,024 --> 00:03:40,784
Are you ready for bed?

40
00:03:40,816 --> 00:03:42,097
No.

41
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:42,993
Why not?

42
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:43,824
Will you check?

43
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,121
There's no monsters
under there, Junebug.

44
00:03:47,153 --> 00:03:47,920
Please?

45
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:49,584
Okay.

46
00:03:55,441 --> 00:03:56,656
It's all clear.

47
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:07,953
You know what?

48
00:04:09,648 --> 00:04:10,608
A long time ago,

49
00:04:14,352 --> 00:04:16,176
an Indian medicine
woman gave me this.

50
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:18,673
She told me

51
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,985
that it would protect
the wearer from darkness.

52
00:04:24,017 --> 00:04:26,671
[gentle music]

53
00:04:26,704 --> 00:04:28,433
Is it really true?

54
00:04:28,465 --> 00:04:30,225
It's really true she said it.

55
00:04:31,697 --> 00:04:33,904
Listen, I'll tell you
something I know is true.

56
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,689
If any monster ever
tries to hurt you,

57
00:04:37,905 --> 00:04:39,216
it's gonna find out real quick,

58
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:40,976
your daddy's the scariest
thing in the dark.

59
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,585
Very scariest thing, okay?

60
00:04:46,992 --> 00:04:48,209
Go to sleep.

61
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:50,736
[somber music]

62
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:07,120
You're doing it again.

63
00:05:09,072 --> 00:05:11,920
[Sully] Doing what?

64
00:05:11,952 --> 00:05:13,553
Warming up your
trigger finger.

65
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:28,080
You do that whenever you're
thinking of mischief.

66
00:05:30,321 --> 00:05:31,344
Maybe you better
find something else

67
00:05:31,377 --> 00:05:32,720
to occupy my mind then.

68
00:05:34,831 --> 00:05:36,912
Well, maybe I'll
just find a better way

69
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:38,320
to warm up your finger.

70
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:41,968

[slow suspenseful music]

76
00:06:35,344 --> 00:06:37,009
Turmoil and seething.

77
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,345
As if this earth,
in fast, fit pants

78
00:06:39,377 --> 00:06:42,288
were breathing a
mighty fountain.

79
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:43,825
He was forced.

80
00:06:43,856 --> 00:06:45,553
Men whose swift path.

81
00:06:47,313 --> 00:06:49,808
Fragments, like rebounding hail

82
00:06:50,897 --> 00:06:54,801
or chaffy grain beneath
the threshers flail.

83
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:57,969
Christ almighty.

84
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:01,328
That's pretty.

[slow suspenseful music]

86
00:07:06,865 --> 00:07:08,560

98
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,801
He give us the slip?

99
00:08:53,137 --> 00:08:54,512
Think he gave us the shaft.

100

[gun fires]

101
00:09:04,112 --> 00:09:04,880
Dammit!

102
00:09:04,913 --> 00:09:06,833
Drop the pistol.

[Chancho speaking
in foreign language]

104
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,384
Drop the pistol.

105
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:11,856
Who the hell are you?

106
00:09:11,888 --> 00:09:14,610
Allow me to answer your
question with a question.

107
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,537
Dropped the pistol?

108
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,912
[gun fires]

109
00:09:16,944 --> 00:09:18,768
Son of a bitch.

110
00:09:18,801 --> 00:09:20,370
Salvador Guevara,

111
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,320
we are sworn officers
of the court.

112
00:09:22,352 --> 00:09:24,368
We have a warrant
for your arrest.

113
00:09:24,401 --> 00:09:25,681
[gun fires]

114
00:09:25,713 --> 00:09:27,537
Drop the pistol, Chancho,

115
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,744
before you do something
you're gonna regret.

116
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:31,633
He's already done that.

117
00:09:31,664 --> 00:09:33,328
I swallowed my chaw.

118
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:35,217
Negotiations are fucking over.

119
00:09:35,248 --> 00:09:36,048
You going in?

120
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,184
He's coming out.

121
00:09:39,217 --> 00:09:40,752
Like hell he is.

122
00:09:40,785 --> 00:09:42,928
He's hold up in there
tighter than a nuns nasties.

123
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:45,616
Well I gave him high
marks for holding up.

124
00:09:45,648 --> 00:09:48,496
I have to sorely fault him
for his choice of hole.

125
00:09:48,528 --> 00:09:49,969
You know, it's a shame
somebody with your talents

126
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,361
couldn't have applied himself
in a more positive direction.

127
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:54,544
Instead of just causing chaos,

128
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:55,985
you could've served
some real purpose.

129
00:09:56,016 --> 00:09:59,344
Well, that's where we have
to agree to disagree, Captain.

130
00:09:59,377 --> 00:10:00,177
The way I see it,

131
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:04,081
causing chaos is my purpose.

132
00:10:04,912 --> 00:10:07,792

[men coughing]

136
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,745
Well, he dropped the pistol.

137
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,137
He sure held fast to
this though, didn't he.

138
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,120
[suspenseful music]

139
00:10:39,152 --> 00:10:41,296
Don't look like
$5,000, don't he?

140
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:44,432
One man's trash.

141
00:10:46,544 --> 00:10:47,408
What about that?

142
00:10:48,594 --> 00:10:49,554
What about it?

143
00:10:49,585 --> 00:10:50,384
Is it gold?

144
00:10:51,313 --> 00:10:52,848
Tastes like it.

145
00:10:52,881 --> 00:10:53,680
So?

146
00:10:54,801 --> 00:10:56,144
So we turn it
into the marshal,

147
00:10:56,176 --> 00:10:58,257
along with this
smoking sack of shit.

148
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,536
We're bastards, gentlemen.

149
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,025
We don't need to
be greedy bastards.

151
00:12:24,561 --> 00:12:29,265
Hey. [clicks tongues]

152
00:12:30,385 --> 00:12:31,345
[Kate] Got the drop
on you, cow puncher.

153
00:12:32,432 --> 00:12:33,234
I surrender.

154
00:12:36,081 --> 00:12:37,074
Am I wanted man?

155
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:43,632
Very wanted.

156
00:12:47,537 --> 00:12:48,912
Deeply wanted.

157
00:12:56,721 --> 00:13:00,145
There was a time I had
a $3,000 price on my head.

158
00:13:00,177 --> 00:13:02,416
Your head's not even
your most valuable part.

159
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:17,904
Come inside and dance with me?

160
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:21,073
I'm a respectable young woman.

161
00:13:21,105 --> 00:13:23,696
I can't be seen dancing
with a desperate outlaw.

162
00:13:23,728 --> 00:13:25,456
Afraid people will
get the right idea?

What were you doing
out here anyway?

166
00:14:15,152 --> 00:14:16,753
I needed to tell
you something.

167
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:19,472
Tell me something?

168
00:14:21,105 --> 00:14:23,281
Been rolling around the
hay with somebody else?

169
00:14:29,072 --> 00:14:32,017
We're both rolling around
the hay with somebody else.

170
00:14:36,945 --> 00:14:39,440

171
00:14:41,392 --> 00:14:42,352
Everybody!

172
00:14:43,441 --> 00:14:44,593
Next round's on me.

173
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:45,872

00:15:20,592 --> 00:15:22,672
Well, well, well.

177
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:25,009
Looks like we
captured some savages.

178
00:15:26,576 --> 00:15:28,112
Just one small step
from the jungle

179
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:29,681
to the zoo, eh, boys?

180
00:15:29,713 --> 00:15:30,769
Captain Potter,

181
00:15:31,793 --> 00:15:33,809
Sergeant Lexington,

182
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,737
and Mr. Ninekiller.

183
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,153
Where were you
three last evening?

184
00:15:39,185 --> 00:15:40,912
Oh, I don't know.

185
00:15:40,944 --> 00:15:41,872
Where are we now?

186
00:15:41,904 --> 00:15:42,864
Take a guess.

187
00:15:46,225 --> 00:15:49,424
Well, the whole place
is empty of charm,

188
00:15:49,456 --> 00:15:50,673
full of old fools,

189
00:15:50,705 --> 00:15:52,753
and it, damn, smells like piss.

190
00:15:54,224 --> 00:15:56,080
I'm gonna have to say
either a convalescent home

191
00:15:56,112 --> 00:15:59,184
or Fort Blue.

192
00:15:59,216 --> 00:16:01,776
Deep in the
bowels of Fort Blue.

193
00:16:01,808 --> 00:16:04,560
Exactly where a couple of
troublesome turds like you belong.

194
00:16:04,592 --> 00:16:06,097
That'll do, major.

195
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:07,632
Major?

196
00:16:07,664 --> 00:16:08,752
That's right.

197
00:16:08,784 --> 00:16:10,033
See the star?

198
00:16:10,065 --> 00:16:11,825
Makes me a major.

199
00:16:11,857 --> 00:16:14,737
[laughs] Well,
of course it is,

200
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:17,777
just like sticking feathers
up my ass makes me a chicken.

201
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:19,216
Enough.

202
00:16:19,248 --> 00:16:22,256
Rumor has it the Wolf Hounds
were entertaining last night.

203
00:16:22,288 --> 00:16:24,689
We're always
entertaining, Colonel.

204
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,864
Last night we were
positively enthralling.

205
00:16:26,896 --> 00:16:28,369
Over near Catches Hollow?

206
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:30,001
Because the town folks
tell me they saw you

207
00:16:30,033 --> 00:16:31,313
in the area last evening.

208
00:16:32,145 --> 00:16:33,233
If they remember last night,

209
00:16:33,265 --> 00:16:34,929
then trust me,
they weren't there.

210
00:16:35,921 --> 00:16:38,160
You like this flask, Sergeant?

211
00:16:38,192 --> 00:16:39,889
We found it in the
charred heaping ashes

212
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:42,032
of the Gregor coal
mining concern,

213
00:16:42,064 --> 00:16:43,633
what's left of it.

214
00:16:43,665 --> 00:16:45,072
It reminds me of you,

215
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,928
not just because it's
battered all to hell,

216
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,361
and leaking combustible fluids.

217
00:16:49,393 --> 00:16:51,888
But because it's got your
goddamn name etched on it.

218
00:16:52,976 --> 00:16:54,129
Horse shit.

219
00:16:54,161 --> 00:16:56,592
Yeah, the guy that
you captured, Guevara,

220
00:16:56,624 --> 00:16:58,001
well, he was in the area

221
00:16:58,033 --> 00:17:01,137
to give information
to a Union spy.

222
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:04,497
But he managed to
get himself detonated

223
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:06,384
before he could do that.

224
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:07,248
You're welcome.

225
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:09,936
Did he have anything on him?

226
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:11,345
Old locker colt,

227
00:17:11,377 --> 00:17:12,689
turned it into the marshal.

228
00:17:13,807 --> 00:17:14,577
Anything else?

229
00:17:15,888 --> 00:17:17,393
Like what?

230
00:17:17,425 --> 00:17:19,760
Like a golden
necklace, an amulet,

231
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:21,520
about yay big.

232
00:17:24,016 --> 00:17:25,264
Nope, nothing like that.

233
00:17:26,256 --> 00:17:27,025
Why?

234
00:17:27,057 --> 00:17:28,464
300 years ago,

235
00:17:28,497 --> 00:17:32,080
the Spanish laid waste to
the Aztec and Incan empires.

236
00:17:32,112 --> 00:17:35,505
They carted off tons
of gold and jewelry,

237
00:17:35,536 --> 00:17:37,521
but a rumor persisted

238
00:17:37,553 --> 00:17:40,049
of another empire
far to the North,

239
00:17:40,081 --> 00:17:42,161
older and richer,

240
00:17:42,193 --> 00:17:43,792
with cities made of gold,

241
00:17:43,824 --> 00:17:48,081
and a vast fortune buried
underground and a sacred vault.

242
00:17:48,113 --> 00:17:50,641
You see, legend says that
the treasure was buried

243
00:17:50,673 --> 00:17:54,127
as part of an offering
for an underworld deity.

244
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,889
Snake god named Supai.

245
00:17:57,232 --> 00:17:59,281
Apparently the high priest
that did the offering

246
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:02,353
fashioned a map in the
form of a golden amulet.

247
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:06,576
The centerpiece had
three interlocking pieces

248
00:18:06,607 --> 00:18:09,713
representing earth,
heaven, and hell.

249
00:18:10,865 --> 00:18:13,327
After that, he broke
it into three parts,

250
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,247
scattered it so that nobody

251
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,207
could find the treasure

252
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,032
unless they were worthy.

253
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:20,465
Chancho reportedly
had the first.

254
00:18:20,497 --> 00:18:22,864
The second it's
lost in the wind,

255
00:18:22,896 --> 00:18:25,553
but the third and final piece,

256
00:18:25,585 --> 00:18:27,953
the Union says they
know where it is,

257
00:18:27,984 --> 00:18:30,929
and they've sent a full
company to recover it.

258
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:31,760
So where is it?

259
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:36,560
La Mojarra.

260
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:38,769
Jesus Christ.

261
00:18:40,336 --> 00:18:42,609
As I recall, you boys
tried that once before,

262
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:44,753
13th cavalry.

263
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:46,960
It was a dead end.

264
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,209
Yeah.

265
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:49,840
In more ways than one.

266
00:18:49,872 --> 00:18:52,591
New information says there's
some sort of secret passage

267
00:18:52,624 --> 00:18:53,873
at the base of the canyon,

268
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:56,624
hidden doorway to a cave

269
00:18:56,656 --> 00:18:59,568
locals call Boca del Inferno.

270
00:19:01,231 --> 00:19:02,033
The hell's mouth.

271
00:19:02,065 --> 00:19:03,633
[slow suspenseful music]

272
00:19:03,665 --> 00:19:05,841
We need a small
team of marauders

273
00:19:05,873 --> 00:19:07,761
to get there ahead of the Union,

274
00:19:07,793 --> 00:19:09,425
find the three pieces

275
00:19:09,457 --> 00:19:10,927
and bring 'em back here.

276
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,265
Well, it sounds
like a hell of a team.

277
00:19:14,064 --> 00:19:15,217
Sure hope you find them.

278
00:19:16,401 --> 00:19:18,160
Would you be so kind
as to have the valet

279
00:19:18,193 --> 00:19:19,824
fetch our personal effects?

280
00:19:19,857 --> 00:19:22,320
Your personal effects
are being held here,

281
00:19:23,153 --> 00:19:24,176
as are you.

282
00:19:26,481 --> 00:19:27,633
What weapon you got

283
00:19:27,665 --> 00:19:28,913
you think you can
accomplish that?

284
00:19:28,945 --> 00:19:29,745
This one.

285
00:19:31,473 --> 00:19:34,705
Seems that in light of
last night's incident,

286
00:19:34,736 --> 00:19:37,744
the general is revoking
all special privileges,

287
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,305
contingent upon your
assistance with this matter.

288
00:19:41,425 --> 00:19:42,289
The answer's no.

289
00:19:42,321 --> 00:19:43,728
I wasn't asking a question,

290
00:19:43,761 --> 00:19:45,169
and neither was the general.

291
00:19:46,512 --> 00:19:48,785
You wolf hounds have
spent the last three years

292
00:19:48,817 --> 00:19:51,697
racking up a list of crimes
that would make the devil blush.

293
00:19:52,785 --> 00:19:54,544
Now we've been willing
to look past it

294
00:19:54,577 --> 00:19:57,007
because of your assistance
with the Confederacy.

295
00:19:57,904 --> 00:20:00,784
But if you three refuse now,

296
00:20:00,816 --> 00:20:03,984
you'll be prosecuted to the
fullest extent of the law.

297
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,737
Your free ride is over.

298
00:20:09,136 --> 00:20:10,161
Now there's the case,

299
00:20:10,993 --> 00:20:12,464
and there's the door.

300
00:20:13,584 --> 00:20:14,896
It's a package deal.

302
00:20:19,729 --> 00:20:20,529
This is nice.

303
00:20:43,537 --> 00:20:46,257
Can we break out of this?
[drums rolling]

304
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:47,729
No, if we break out,

305
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,649
we're just gonna have 600
regulars out looking for us.

306
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,009
No 600 regulars who can't
find their own assholes.

307
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,416
Some assholes
are hard to miss.

308
00:20:54,449 --> 00:20:55,216
Touche.

309
00:20:57,648 --> 00:20:59,407
Is there another
way out of this cell?

310
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:01,488
Yeah, sure.

311
00:21:02,385 --> 00:21:03,151
Chancho's way.

to find all three
pieces of the puzzle

317
00:21:16,305 --> 00:21:20,400
and bring 'em back
here in seven days.

318

We'll just have to find it.

324
00:21:40,977 --> 00:21:42,033
Good luck with that.

325
00:21:42,928 --> 00:21:44,527
The marshal has it,

326
00:21:44,561 --> 00:21:46,129
it's halfway up
the coast by now.

spend trying to find it

headed to La Mojarra.

now is a bed, a bath,

00:24:05,808 --> 00:24:06,864
but I got to tell you,

370
00:24:07,953 --> 00:24:09,488
that was pretty god dang smooth.

371
00:24:10,897 --> 00:24:12,401
Were the mariachis in on it,

372
00:24:12,432 --> 00:24:15,185
or was that just sort
of like serendipity?

373
00:24:16,432 --> 00:24:18,225
Know what, don't tell me.

374
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:19,121
I like not knowing.

375
00:24:19,152 --> 00:24:20,560
This doesn't belong to you.

376
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:22,992
Well, unless you're a
serpent god from the underworld

377
00:24:23,025 --> 00:24:25,328
I don't expect your name's
written on it either.

378
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,736
So I guess we'll
just have to say

379
00:24:26,768 --> 00:24:28,560
that possession is nine tenths.

380
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,088
Strong words from a man
who doesn't posses it.

381
00:24:33,169 --> 00:24:34,704
I'm what you call an optimist.

382
00:24:36,624 --> 00:24:39,664
[slow suspenseful music]

383
00:24:39,697 --> 00:24:42,704
You know, if you're
playing the odds

384
00:24:43,856 --> 00:24:45,424
that I've got some
sense of chivalry,

385
00:24:46,673 --> 00:24:48,016
that's a bad bet.

386
00:24:48,048 --> 00:24:51,184
Oh no, I'm doing a man's work.

387
00:24:51,217 --> 00:24:53,872
I expect to earn a man's wages.

388
00:24:55,088 --> 00:24:55,857
That a girl.

389
00:24:58,737 --> 00:25:00,113
I'm counting to three.

390
00:25:00,145 --> 00:25:01,808
I'm counting to one.

391
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,640
[glass shattering]
[dramatic music]

392
00:25:08,401 --> 00:25:11,025
[woman coughing]

393
00:25:22,033 --> 00:25:23,888
Didn't catch that.

394
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,784
They were...

395
00:25:27,248 --> 00:25:29,904
[dramatic music]

396
00:25:34,288 --> 00:25:35,248
I warned you boys,

397
00:25:37,585 --> 00:25:39,184
when you shoot at the king,

398
00:25:39,217 --> 00:25:40,977
you better kill the king.

399
00:25:41,008 --> 00:25:43,921
[man speaking in
foreign language]

400
00:25:43,953 --> 00:25:45,360
As a general rule,

401
00:25:45,392 --> 00:25:46,672
I try not to draw down any
less than five at a time

402
00:25:46,704 --> 00:25:48,401
but I'll tell you what,

403
00:25:48,432 --> 00:25:49,392
if it makes you feel any better,

404
00:25:49,425 --> 00:25:52,657
I can draw
left-handed. [chuckles]

405
00:25:52,688 --> 00:25:54,096
Truth be told,

406
00:25:54,128 --> 00:25:55,920
I'd kind of like to keep
my right hand free anyway,

407
00:25:55,952 --> 00:25:56,912
for your sisters.

408
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,745
[dramatic music]

409
00:26:01,776 --> 00:26:04,081
[gun firing]

410
00:26:05,137 --> 00:26:08,176
[dogs barking]

411
00:26:08,209 --> 00:26:10,864
[dramatic music]

412
00:26:16,914 --> 00:26:17,874
Dadgummit!

413
00:26:19,664 --> 00:26:22,288
[dramatic music]

414
00:26:25,008 --> 00:26:28,112
[woman coughing]

415
00:26:28,144 --> 00:26:29,008
Three.

416
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:29,841
Don't.

417
00:26:30,897 --> 00:26:32,274
- You need me.
- Why?

418
00:26:32,305 --> 00:26:34,416
Is there a sudden shortage
of treacherous whores?

419
00:26:34,448 --> 00:26:35,920
Chancho was my husband.

420
00:26:35,953 --> 00:26:37,040
My condolences.

421
00:26:37,074 --> 00:26:38,352
So fucking what?

422
00:26:38,385 --> 00:26:40,464
So I'm the only person alive

423
00:26:40,497 --> 00:26:42,096
who knows where to find
the other two pieces

424
00:26:42,128 --> 00:26:43,472
of that amulet.

425
00:26:43,504 --> 00:26:45,040
And you'll help us what?

426
00:26:45,072 --> 00:26:46,641
Out of the kindness
of your heart?

427
00:26:46,674 --> 00:26:48,048
No.

428
00:26:48,081 --> 00:26:49,232
But I'll help you for

429
00:26:53,104 --> 00:26:54,256
$10,000.

430
00:26:54,288 --> 00:26:55,824
That's what I call
a high dollar hooker.

431
00:26:55,857 --> 00:26:57,456
It's twice the
price you collected

432
00:26:57,488 --> 00:26:58,672
for my husband's head,

433
00:26:58,704 --> 00:27:00,400
you fucking cabron.

434
00:27:00,432 --> 00:27:02,833
[tense music]

435
00:27:07,408 --> 00:27:10,705
[slow suspenseful music]

436
00:27:37,521 --> 00:27:38,449
You a ghost?

437
00:27:40,112 --> 00:27:40,976
Beg your pardon?

438
00:27:41,872 --> 00:27:43,314
Only people that walk around

439
00:27:43,345 --> 00:27:44,881
in the middle of the
night in a graveyard

440
00:27:44,912 --> 00:27:49,137
are gravediggers, grave
robbers, and ghosts.

441
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,512
Looking for a friend of mine,

442
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:51,793
used to live around here.

443
00:27:51,824 --> 00:27:53,392
Captain Benjamin Cook.

444
00:27:53,424 --> 00:27:54,577
Ole Captain Cook.

445
00:27:56,689 --> 00:27:58,832
Yeah, you know where
I might find him?

446
00:27:58,864 --> 00:27:59,665
Yep.

447
00:28:00,976 --> 00:28:02,736
About 20 yards that way.

448
00:28:02,768 --> 00:28:03,632
Six feet down.

449
00:28:03,664 --> 00:28:04,465
He's dead.

450
00:28:05,552 --> 00:28:07,345
He died about four years ago.

451
00:28:09,776 --> 00:28:11,121
He a friend of yours?

452
00:28:11,154 --> 00:28:12,081
Well tell you the truth,

453
00:28:12,114 --> 00:28:12,977
he was an ornery old cunt,

454
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:14,224
and nobody much liked him.

455
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:18,256
You know, there was a time

456
00:28:18,288 --> 00:28:19,633
I would knock you to
the ground for that.

457
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:21,553
There was a time you
could've done it too.

458
00:28:24,465 --> 00:28:25,554
How you been, Captain?

459
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,168
Busy.

460
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,032
What do you want?

461
00:28:31,632 --> 00:28:33,169
Came out here looking for you.

462
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,210
Right here, right
where I've been every day

463
00:28:37,074 --> 00:28:38,704
for the past six years.

464
00:28:38,737 --> 00:28:39,536
You're right.

465
00:28:40,464 --> 00:28:41,680
There's six years between us.

466
00:28:41,712 --> 00:28:43,504
I don't know how to bridge that.

467
00:28:43,537 --> 00:28:44,944
You just have
to treat the river

468
00:28:44,976 --> 00:28:48,784
like it's a puddle and skip
over it, you know, small talk.

469
00:28:49,649 --> 00:28:50,449
Okay.

470
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,624
How's your day?

471
00:28:54,225 --> 00:28:55,440
I buried my dog.

472
00:28:58,257 --> 00:28:59,057
How was yours?

473
00:29:00,945 --> 00:29:01,808
Woke up in jail.

474
00:29:07,376 --> 00:29:09,296
We need smaller
talking than this.

475
00:29:09,328 --> 00:29:12,368
Well, I'll drink to that.

476
00:29:13,872 --> 00:29:16,752
[light tense music]

477
00:29:22,416 --> 00:29:23,344
Have a seat.

478
00:29:27,889 --> 00:29:29,040
What are these?

479
00:29:29,072 --> 00:29:30,096
Some of the rich folks

480
00:29:30,128 --> 00:29:31,794
are buried with pull cords

481
00:29:31,825 --> 00:29:34,224
in case they're buried alive.

482
00:29:34,256 --> 00:29:34,992
Shit.

483
00:29:44,145 --> 00:29:45,008
I'm putting together a crew

484
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:46,512
and I want you to come with me.

485
00:29:46,545 --> 00:29:48,432
You want me to come with you?

486
00:29:48,465 --> 00:29:49,520
Where to?

487
00:29:49,552 --> 00:29:50,352
La Mojarra.

488
00:29:51,985 --> 00:29:52,849
[slow suspenseful music]

489
00:29:52,881 --> 00:29:53,905
I'd offer you another drink,

490
00:29:53,937 --> 00:29:55,761
but I think you've had enough.

491
00:29:57,457 --> 00:29:59,312
You must have more
goddamn spirits in you

492
00:29:59,344 --> 00:30:00,945
than the church yard.

493
00:30:00,976 --> 00:30:02,577
I'm prepared to pay you.

494
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:05,648
Ain't enough cash
money in all the world.

495
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,024
We need a guide, Cook.

496
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:08,209
You need a miracle.

497
00:30:08,241 --> 00:30:10,545
Hundred men left on
that raid six years ago.

498
00:30:11,889 --> 00:30:13,969
You're the only
one to come back.

499
00:30:14,001 --> 00:30:16,336
And to quite the
hero's welcome too, huh?

500
00:30:17,552 --> 00:30:18,929
They threw me in jail,

501
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,984
took away my rank.

502
00:30:20,016 --> 00:30:21,585
Man's more than a rank, Cook.

503
00:30:21,617 --> 00:30:22,674
Oh, is that a fact,

504
00:30:23,729 --> 00:30:25,104
Captain Potter?

505
00:30:25,136 --> 00:30:26,353
Fact is, you used to be

506
00:30:26,385 --> 00:30:28,048
the deadliest son of
a bitch I ever met.

507
00:30:29,425 --> 00:30:31,536
You were a wolf
hound, goddammit.

508
00:30:31,568 --> 00:30:33,073
Yeah.

509
00:30:33,105 --> 00:30:34,736
But you fled the
field of battle.

510
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:37,969
You abandoned your
brothers in arms.

511
00:30:39,536 --> 00:30:40,400
The only reason you
could give for it

512
00:30:40,432 --> 00:30:41,937
was all sorts of nonsense

513
00:30:41,969 --> 00:30:43,952
about monsters and darklings.

514
00:30:43,984 --> 00:30:45,264
All sorts of nonsense,

515
00:30:47,729 --> 00:30:49,168
just happened to be the truth.

516
00:30:49,201 --> 00:30:50,736
Doesn't matter.

517
00:30:50,768 --> 00:30:53,201
You came under attack
and you ran from it.

518
00:30:53,233 --> 00:30:57,616
The whole 13th
Calvary ran from it.

519
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:58,929
I just ran fastest.

520
00:31:00,081 --> 00:31:03,057
Imagine if all the
evil in the world

521
00:31:03,089 --> 00:31:05,360
has come shambling
out of the darkness,

522
00:31:05,392 --> 00:31:06,512
grim reaper himself.

523
00:31:06,545 --> 00:31:07,857
What would you do?

524
00:31:11,248 --> 00:31:12,976
I'd show him how
a wolf can fight.

525
00:31:14,704 --> 00:31:16,784
[mysterious music]

526
00:31:16,816 --> 00:31:17,808
I missed you Sully.

527
00:31:20,977 --> 00:31:21,776
I'm sorry.

528
00:31:22,897 --> 00:31:25,200
It took me six years
to make this walk.

529
00:31:25,232 --> 00:31:26,416
I'm sorry you had to
make it for nothing,

530
00:31:26,448 --> 00:31:28,272
'cause I'm not
going on any raid,

531
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,056
not to La Mojarra.

532
00:31:31,088 --> 00:31:32,880
Still haven't heard my offer.

533
00:31:32,912 --> 00:31:34,800
Go on back to
Fort Blue, Captain.

534
00:31:34,832 --> 00:31:35,601
There ain't nothing
you can offer me

535
00:31:35,633 --> 00:31:37,393
to change my mind.

536
00:31:37,425 --> 00:31:39,185
I can get you your land back.

537
00:31:39,217 --> 00:31:40,497
[mysterious music]

538
00:31:40,529 --> 00:31:41,808
What?

539
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,153
I can have you
reinstated as an officer

540
00:31:43,185 --> 00:31:44,816
and get your land
returned to you.

541
00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:49,169
Ole Dutch Taverson
owns this land now.

542
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:51,857
Taverson owned it yesterday.

543
00:31:52,945 --> 00:31:54,032
I own it today.

544
00:31:55,216 --> 00:31:56,497
Tomorrow it could be yours.

545
00:31:58,896 --> 00:32:01,904
You mean you'd give
me my old life back,

546
00:32:01,936 --> 00:32:04,113
just like that, for nothing?

547
00:32:04,145 --> 00:32:06,289
No, not for nothing,

548
00:32:07,409 --> 00:32:09,265
in exchange for your
help on this mission.

549
00:32:10,257 --> 00:32:11,121
Don't do this.

550
00:32:12,432 --> 00:32:13,360
You can't do this.

551
00:32:17,328 --> 00:32:20,208
I can work for it for
as long as you want,

552
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,064
but you can't ask
me to go back there.

553
00:32:23,697 --> 00:32:24,848
That's not fair.

554
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,225
You lost your
land and your rank

555
00:32:26,257 --> 00:32:28,081
on a failed mission
to La Mojarra.

556
00:32:29,425 --> 00:32:31,185
You can get them both
back on a successful one.

557
00:32:33,137 --> 00:32:35,440
That couldn't be any
more fair, that's,

558
00:32:35,472 --> 00:32:36,849
hell, that's fucking circular.

559
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:41,232
I need some time
to think on it.

560
00:32:41,264 --> 00:32:42,769
Time's a luxury I ain't got.

561
00:32:44,593 --> 00:32:46,673
We're leaving tomorrow
morning at sun up.

562
00:32:47,792 --> 00:32:50,000
The old haunted wishing
well at Raven's Roost.

563
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,976
You'll be there or you won't.

564
00:32:54,256 --> 00:32:56,560
[soft music]

565
00:32:57,841 --> 00:32:59,664
A wolf don't beg.

566
00:32:59,696 --> 00:33:02,256
[intense music]

567
00:33:20,688 --> 00:33:22,129
All right, you
got two bedrolls,

568
00:33:22,161 --> 00:33:23,249
and a can of tuna.

569
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,881
[Sully] All right.

570
00:33:28,112 --> 00:33:31,280
= You break it, pecker
wood, and you bought it.

571
00:33:34,641 --> 00:33:35,601
Add it to my bill.

572
00:33:36,976 --> 00:33:38,928
Now you can break
it all you want.

573
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,433
Why do we say, Gabriel?

574
00:33:40,465 --> 00:33:42,001
Thank you.

575
00:33:42,033 --> 00:33:43,377
Welcome.

576
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:45,233
We're about to be
on our way, folks.

577
00:33:46,225 --> 00:33:47,568
You like us, Mister?

578
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,169
Going looking for gold?

579
00:33:51,089 --> 00:33:52,336
In a manner of speaking.

580
00:33:53,681 --> 00:33:56,112
I reckon these men
deal mostly in cash, son.

581
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,217
Head on out to the wagon now.

582
00:34:03,057 --> 00:34:04,497
Keep your ma safe out there.

583
00:34:05,616 --> 00:34:07,409
Don't need to
worry about that.

584
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,905
I can shoot the eye out
of a hawk at 500 yard.

585
00:34:14,577 --> 00:34:18,096
Damn useful if they
get attacked by hawks.

586
00:34:19,024 --> 00:34:21,520
[dogs barking]

587
00:34:23,569 --> 00:34:26,225
[metal clanging]

588
00:34:50,193 --> 00:34:52,273
Lex, you son of a bitch.

589
00:34:54,256 --> 00:34:57,040
[mysterious music]

590
00:35:16,591 --> 00:35:18,993
[crow cawing]

591
00:35:32,976 --> 00:35:34,864
[Lex] Morning, sunshine.

592
00:35:34,896 --> 00:35:36,593
[Sully] What the hell
happened to you last night?

593
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:37,968
[Lex] Oh, I met a girl.

594
00:35:38,001 --> 00:35:39,345
Took in a local band.

595
00:35:41,647 --> 00:35:42,801
[Sully] Who's she?

596
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:43,697
[Lex] This here's
the widow Guevara

597
00:35:43,728 --> 00:35:45,265
and our new business partner.

598
00:35:46,096 --> 00:35:48,209
We waiting on anybody else?

599
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,009
[Sully] No, I don't think so.

600
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:50,609
Let's go.

601
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:51,441
Come on.

602
00:35:53,009 --> 00:35:55,793
[mysterious music]

603
00:36:48,945 --> 00:36:51,345
[crow cawing]

604
00:36:53,009 --> 00:36:55,345
[soft music]

605
00:36:58,769 --> 00:37:00,561
That's a secret of
relic of my people

606
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,320
you're defiling with your spit.

607
00:37:05,136 --> 00:37:06,031
What's your name?

608
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:07,951
Dolorosa.

609
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,097
Well shut up, Dolorosa.

610
00:37:11,856 --> 00:37:13,264
And if it's so god dang sacred,

611
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:14,449
then why were you and Chancho

612
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,144
trying to sell it off
in the first place?

613
00:37:16,177 --> 00:37:17,777
My people are starving.

614
00:37:17,808 --> 00:37:19,665
So you decided to
sell your birthright

615
00:37:19,697 --> 00:37:21,329
for a mess of pottage, huh?

616
00:37:22,256 --> 00:37:23,089
That's a shame.

617
00:37:24,271 --> 00:37:26,737
[indistinct]
doesn't know shame.

618
00:37:27,729 --> 00:37:30,513
[soft tense music]

619
00:37:33,489 --> 00:37:35,281
In the bottom of
his case of whiskey.

620
00:37:35,313 --> 00:37:36,945
[Lex laughs]

621
00:37:36,977 --> 00:37:39,536
Make it in places I need
three mirrors to even see.

622
00:37:41,169 --> 00:37:44,431
[slow suspenseful music]

623
00:38:20,368 --> 00:38:21,168
Jesus.

624
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,928
A Tonco wouldn't do this.

625
00:38:30,961 --> 00:38:31,857
Nobody would.

626
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:38,129
[slow suspenseful music]

627
00:38:39,729 --> 00:38:41,136
Anybody else
find the freshness

628
00:38:41,168 --> 00:38:43,984
of that blood a
might unsettling?

629
00:38:49,233 --> 00:38:50,897
What were they doing
way the hell out here?

630
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:51,953
Hunting wolves.

631
00:38:53,104 --> 00:38:54,480
From the look at those pelts,

632
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:56,977
they took a few skins.

633
00:38:57,009 --> 00:38:58,545
Yep,

634
00:38:58,577 --> 00:38:59,824
and something took theirs.

635
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:05,040
[slow suspenseful music]

636
00:39:09,008 --> 00:39:10,736
Those symbols mean
anything to you?

637
00:39:12,912 --> 00:39:14,513
It means we need
to keep moving.

638
00:39:18,608 --> 00:39:19,376
Come on.

639
00:39:22,256 --> 00:39:25,073
[mysterious music]

640
00:40:12,016 --> 00:40:12,976
[Sully] If we're
looking for something

641
00:40:13,009 --> 00:40:14,768
the Spanish buried here,

642
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,497
how the hell old
is this graveyard?

643
00:40:17,553 --> 00:40:20,689
Your white settlers
built a cemetery

644
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,473
on top of an ancient
burial mound of my people.

645
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:27,248
And an alter to your new god,

646
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,416
on top of a temple
to a much older one.

647
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:33,169
[thunder crashes]

648
00:40:37,904 --> 00:40:40,720
[mysterious music]

649
00:40:42,865 --> 00:40:45,584
[shovel thudding]

650
00:40:50,384 --> 00:40:52,944
[fist thudding]

651
00:40:54,672 --> 00:40:56,465
[dramatic music]

652
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:57,296
Christ!

653
00:40:58,512 --> 00:40:59,824
Only take the amulet.

654
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,328
Don't disturb the other pieces.

655
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:05,840
[slow suspenseful music]

656
00:41:13,072 --> 00:41:13,872
Pass it up.

657
00:41:15,792 --> 00:41:17,552
Throw the rope down.

658
00:41:21,616 --> 00:41:24,080
[thunder rumbling]

659
00:41:24,113 --> 00:41:26,896
[mysterious music]

660
00:41:41,008 --> 00:41:45,521
[body thudding]
[tense music]

661
00:41:45,552 --> 00:41:46,928
Well, well, well,

662
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,040
just the big, bad wolf hounds.

663
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:49,873
Keller?

664
00:41:51,152 --> 00:41:52,753
Or is it the
three little pigs?

665
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:57,616
This might be cold comfort,

666
00:41:57,649 --> 00:42:00,496
but for what it's worth,

667
00:42:00,529 --> 00:42:01,936
I did try to spare you this.

668
00:42:03,248 --> 00:42:05,072
I assured the Colonel he
didn't need to hire marauders,

669
00:42:05,104 --> 00:42:07,088
he already had the
perfect tool for the job.

670
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,784
You're a perfect
tool, all right.

671
00:42:09,872 --> 00:42:11,185
Huffing and
puffing to the end.

672
00:42:12,528 --> 00:42:13,904
This isn't the end, Keller.

673
00:42:15,632 --> 00:42:17,296
You got one piece.

674
00:42:17,328 --> 00:42:19,600
You planning to come down here

675
00:42:19,633 --> 00:42:20,754
and take the other one?

676
00:42:22,128 --> 00:42:24,529
As appealing as that
sounds, little pig,

677
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,865
I haven't the time to roll
around in the mud with you.

678
00:42:26,896 --> 00:42:28,752
Afraid you'll get your
hands a little dirty?

679
00:42:28,785 --> 00:42:30,672
No, it's just been
enough mudslinging

680
00:42:30,705 --> 00:42:31,696
for one day, Captain.

681
00:42:32,752 --> 00:42:34,641
You've already
lost enough ground.

682
00:42:34,672 --> 00:42:35,953
Don't you think?

683
00:42:37,744 --> 00:42:40,528
[mysterious music]

684
00:42:42,544 --> 00:42:44,401
Son of a bitch!

685
00:42:44,432 --> 00:42:45,840
And with that,

686
00:42:45,872 --> 00:42:49,617
I must bid the three
of you a fond ado,

687
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:53,776
or adios, as the case might be.

688
00:42:56,017 --> 00:42:58,801
[mysterious music]

689
00:43:05,937 --> 00:43:07,664
Something about this place,

690
00:43:07,696 --> 00:43:09,105
spookin' the horses.

691
00:43:09,136 --> 00:43:10,480
Can't say I blame them.

692
00:43:12,304 --> 00:43:14,384
Stay here with Lyles and Nunley.

693
00:43:14,416 --> 00:43:15,856
When we're safely gone,

694
00:43:15,888 --> 00:43:17,808
put a bullet in
those raiders' heads.

695
00:43:17,841 --> 00:43:19,568
Cover the grave up, no traces.

696
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,400
Yes sir.

697
00:43:22,096 --> 00:43:24,913
[mysterious music]

698
00:43:29,937 --> 00:43:31,729
Ever think you'd end
up in a place like this?

699
00:43:31,761 --> 00:43:32,880
A graveyard?

700
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,281
Yeah.

701
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:39,696
[wolves howling]

702
00:43:44,944 --> 00:43:47,217
I told you, those are
not to be disturbed.

703
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,584
Can't a fella at least
die doing what he loves?

704
00:43:51,601 --> 00:43:52,496
Captain Potter.

705
00:43:53,905 --> 00:43:56,560
I had the honor of fighting
along side you at Red Bow.

706
00:43:57,488 --> 00:44:00,144
[dramatic music]

707
00:44:01,393 --> 00:44:02,704
I'll make it a clean death.

708
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,200
What a tribute.

709
00:44:05,233 --> 00:44:08,177
[wolf growling]

710
00:44:08,209 --> 00:44:09,712
You kill the woman.

711
00:44:09,744 --> 00:44:14,544
[dramatic music]
[man screaming]

712
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,960
[gun fires]
[wolves growling]

713
00:44:25,776 --> 00:44:28,785
[gun firing]

714
00:44:28,816 --> 00:44:31,472
[wolves howling]

715
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:35,824

[wolf growling]

718
00:44:59,472 --> 00:45:00,432
Fuck this.

719
00:45:04,849 --> 00:45:08,112
[slow suspenseful music]

720
00:45:09,649 --> 00:45:12,368
[dirt clattering]

721
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,434
We getting bigger or is
this grave getting smaller?

722
00:45:19,314 --> 00:45:20,560
Walls are closing in.

723
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:21,360
Go.

724
00:45:21,392 --> 00:45:22,608
Go, go, go, go.

725
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,664
Go, go, go.

726
00:45:24,624 --> 00:45:27,280
[dramatic music]

727
00:45:29,296 --> 00:45:32,016
[animals howling]

728
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,952
What are they?

729
00:45:59,985 --> 00:46:01,680
Skin walkers.

730
00:46:01,712 --> 00:46:04,337
[dramatic music]

731
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,496
[wolf growling]

732
00:46:16,528 --> 00:46:18,769
[gun fires]

733
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:26,289
[wolf softly growling]

734
00:46:26,321 --> 00:46:27,825
You're late.

735
00:46:27,856 --> 00:46:29,008
I thought you meant the other

736
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:31,760
haunted wishing well
at Raider's Roost.

737
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:32,592
What'd I miss?

738
00:46:33,616 --> 00:46:34,832
Digging up buried treasure,

739
00:46:34,864 --> 00:46:36,272
fighting werewolves,

740
00:46:36,304 --> 00:46:37,873
business as usual.

741
00:46:37,905 --> 00:46:39,057
Welcome aboard, captain.

742
00:46:40,817 --> 00:46:41,584
Sergeant.

743
00:46:43,376 --> 00:46:44,176
Cook.

744
00:46:50,481 --> 00:46:52,177
Well, at least them calvary boys

745
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:54,704
was nice enough to leave
their horses behind for us.

746
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,736
And a shit load of TNT.

747
00:47:00,913 --> 00:47:02,256
What were they gonna do?

748
00:47:02,288 --> 00:47:04,080
Blast their way
into Hell's mouth?

749
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,456
Doesn't matter.

750
00:47:05,488 --> 00:47:07,056
They don't need it.

751
00:47:07,088 --> 00:47:08,849
They have both
pieces of the amulet.

752
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,056
Yeah, and while we're standing
around holding our dicks,

753
00:47:11,088 --> 00:47:13,265
they're getting further
away ever minute.

754
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:15,952
No, not with this storm
coming in, they ain't.

755
00:47:15,984 --> 00:47:17,265
We'll hold up here.

756
00:47:17,297 --> 00:47:19,217
Get started in the morning.

757
00:47:19,249 --> 00:47:21,392
What the hell lit a fire in
your ass all of a sudden?

758
00:47:21,424 --> 00:47:23,408
Somebody went to a
God awful lot of trouble

759
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,977
to bury that peace
and keep it safe.

760
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:28,657
And they're using this
for window dressing.

761
00:47:29,841 --> 00:47:31,184
Now it seems to me

762
00:47:31,216 --> 00:47:32,785
that maybe we should
entertain the possibility

763
00:47:32,817 --> 00:47:34,353
that this serpent God's treasure

764
00:47:34,385 --> 00:47:35,505
ain't just a fairy tale.

765
00:47:35,537 --> 00:47:36,465
And if it is,

766
00:47:37,808 --> 00:47:39,664
maybe we're looking for
one hell of a happy ending.

767
00:47:39,696 --> 00:47:42,576
You're making the
conquistadors' mistake.

768
00:47:42,608 --> 00:47:46,001
Presuming that my ancestors
share your value system.

769
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:48,881
That real treasure must mean
something you can touch,

770
00:47:48,913 --> 00:47:50,384
is something you can spend.

771
00:47:51,857 --> 00:47:53,456
Well, what the hell
else would it mean?

772
00:47:53,488 --> 00:47:55,920
There is no happy ending.

773
00:47:55,952 --> 00:47:59,184
Those two pieces were the
only way to La Mojarra,

774
00:47:59,216 --> 00:48:00,529
and the amulet,

775
00:48:00,561 --> 00:48:03,345
the only safe talisman
against the darkness of Supai.

776
00:48:05,393 --> 00:48:06,993
You're all arrogant pups

777
00:48:07,025 --> 00:48:08,848
who think this is
some sort of game.

778
00:48:10,001 --> 00:48:11,057
Well the game is over.

779
00:48:12,624 --> 00:48:14,448
We ain't pups, sweetheart.

780
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,504
We're wolf hounds.

781
00:48:16,913 --> 00:48:18,641
Game ain't over till we win it.

782
00:48:18,673 --> 00:48:21,008
I'm not taking you
one step further.

783
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,281
You wanna head on
home without pay?

784
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:27,153
And straight through the
middle of Indian territory?

785
00:48:27,185 --> 00:48:28,113
Go on, be my guest.

786
00:48:29,233 --> 00:48:30,353
I ain't crawling
back to Fort Blue

787
00:48:30,385 --> 00:48:32,305
with my tail tucked
between my legs.

788
00:48:32,337 --> 00:48:35,344
How do you expect to go
forward without the guide?

789
00:48:35,376 --> 00:48:36,464
Got us a guide.

790
00:48:37,424 --> 00:48:38,192
Captain Cook.

791
00:48:39,601 --> 00:48:41,905
You think you can get us
to where X marks the spot?

792
00:48:42,801 --> 00:48:43,569
Yo ho.

793
00:48:44,817 --> 00:48:48,080
[slow suspenseful music]

794
00:49:27,057 --> 00:49:29,553
[horse neighs]

795
00:49:33,393 --> 00:49:35,729
[soft music]

796
00:49:50,609 --> 00:49:52,977
Lex, Cook, you're with me.

797
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,656
Ninekiller, stay with the woman.

798
00:49:58,513 --> 00:50:01,807
[slow suspenseful music]

799
00:50:47,056 --> 00:50:49,425
[somber music]

800
00:51:22,129 --> 00:51:23,089
War party?

801
00:51:24,593 --> 00:51:26,384
Strange they killed the boy.

802
00:51:29,809 --> 00:51:32,176
Normally, they take
the young ones to sell.

803
00:51:33,809 --> 00:51:35,409
He got in the way.

804
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,776
He was trying to protect her.

805
00:51:44,527 --> 00:51:45,744
Which way are they headed?

806
00:51:47,601 --> 00:51:48,400
South.

807
00:51:51,825 --> 00:51:52,624
Saddle up.

808
00:51:56,304 --> 00:52:00,880
Captain, maybe we want to
stick to the task at hand,

809
00:52:02,449 --> 00:52:04,113
patrolling Indian
trails, that's what they

810
00:52:04,144 --> 00:52:05,616
overpay the rangers for.

811
00:52:06,544 --> 00:52:07,857
This ain't really our job.

812
00:52:11,249 --> 00:52:12,081
It is today.

813
00:52:16,816 --> 00:52:19,600
[mysterious music]

814
00:52:24,751 --> 00:52:27,313
[woman humming]

815
00:52:52,209 --> 00:52:54,001
[Woman] I was
afraid my rabbit stew

816
00:52:54,033 --> 00:52:55,280
would attract wolves.

817
00:52:55,313 --> 00:52:56,625
Peace to the camp, ma'am.

818
00:52:57,617 --> 00:52:58,993
We ain't wolves.

819
00:52:59,025 --> 00:53:00,432
We just a couple of strays

820
00:53:00,465 --> 00:53:02,960
who happened to be down
wind from your cook fire.

821
00:53:02,993 --> 00:53:05,104
Strays with sharp teeth.

822
00:53:06,544 --> 00:53:08,689
I'm afraid there's an Indian
war party out in these woods.

823
00:53:10,032 --> 00:53:11,569
Think they crossed the
river back at the shallows

824
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,465
a mile from here.

825
00:53:12,496 --> 00:53:14,704
You out here all by yourself?

826
00:53:14,736 --> 00:53:15,792
Not anymore.

827
00:53:16,913 --> 00:53:19,409
I got two strong
men to protect me.

828
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:23,568
You should know

829
00:53:23,601 --> 00:53:27,151
that strong men
with drawn pistols

830
00:53:27,184 --> 00:53:28,753
may not have any of my stew.

831
00:53:30,865 --> 00:53:32,560
I think that a strong
man is a drawn pistol

832
00:53:32,593 --> 00:53:34,257
will get as much
stew as he wanted.

833
00:53:35,665 --> 00:53:37,711
Captain, I think
you're scaring the lady.

834
00:53:37,744 --> 00:53:38,993
No I ain't.

835
00:53:41,393 --> 00:53:43,504
Now the question
is, why I ain't.

836
00:53:44,848 --> 00:53:46,577
I just said there's an Indian
war party in these woods,

837
00:53:46,608 --> 00:53:49,009
and she's sitting there,
cool as a mountain spring.

838
00:53:50,096 --> 00:53:51,120
Where's your husband?

839
00:53:51,985 --> 00:53:52,849
I don't have one.

840
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,609
Your left hand says you do.

841
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,656
My left hand
isn't that bright.

842
00:53:57,968 --> 00:54:00,625
I wear this ring to
discourage suitors.

843
00:54:02,097 --> 00:54:05,233
My only husband is
an imaginary one.

844
00:54:06,289 --> 00:54:08,400
Your imaginary husband
cut that firewood?

845
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:12,240
Does he wear them boots?

846
00:54:12,271 --> 00:54:13,584
Those boots are mine.

847
00:54:15,504 --> 00:54:17,265
My, my, what
big feet you have.

848
00:54:23,377 --> 00:54:25,808
I was worried
about drawing wolves,

849
00:54:27,984 --> 00:54:30,768
but it seems I
caught a fox instead.

850
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,753
I ain't caught
just yet, sweetheart.

851
00:54:36,784 --> 00:54:37,840
Like hell you ain't.

852
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:41,009
[gun cocks]

853
00:54:43,217 --> 00:54:45,297
Now everybody stay airish.

854
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,008
Christ on a cracker, Potter,

855
00:54:49,041 --> 00:54:49,808
is that you?

856
00:54:49,841 --> 00:54:50,993
It's me.

857
00:54:51,024 --> 00:54:53,584
Well, this here's John
Sullivan Potter boys,

858
00:54:53,616 --> 00:54:55,824
me and him's been through
the mill together.

859
00:54:55,857 --> 00:54:58,256
The hell brings
you to my fireside?

860
00:54:58,289 --> 00:54:59,345
Following the smoke.

861
00:55:00,528 --> 00:55:02,960
Wagon train full of
women and children

862
00:55:02,993 --> 00:55:04,913
got waylaid a ways back.

863
00:55:04,945 --> 00:55:06,288
Well now that's a shame.

864
00:55:06,321 --> 00:55:07,088
Ain't it just.

865
00:55:07,121 --> 00:55:09,041
Injuns, I expect.

866
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:09,871
Nope.

867
00:55:11,281 --> 00:55:12,816
Some cowards sure done it
to make it look that way.

868
00:55:12,848 --> 00:55:15,121
And the big bugs at Ford Blue

869
00:55:15,153 --> 00:55:17,520
got you boys mission aid now.

870
00:55:17,551 --> 00:55:18,320
Is that it?

871
00:55:19,409 --> 00:55:21,265
Passin' through the
highways and the hedges

872
00:55:21,296 --> 00:55:22,672
looking for poor sinners.

873
00:55:24,049 --> 00:55:27,025
[laughs] The Potter
I used to know,

874
00:55:27,056 --> 00:55:29,521
he'd make an unlikely
evangelist in that quarter.

875
00:55:29,553 --> 00:55:31,569
You must have had some winter.

876
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,720
You had quite a fall.

877
00:55:36,081 --> 00:55:38,640
Christ, Grady, what
kind of monster are you?

878
00:55:38,672 --> 00:55:40,113
The patient kind.

879
00:55:42,064 --> 00:55:43,601
My patience done run out.

880
00:55:44,465 --> 00:55:45,585
Now you tell your boys

881
00:55:45,617 --> 00:55:47,664
to slip their fingers
off them triggers,

882
00:55:47,697 --> 00:55:49,744
and you all boom the fuck along.

883
00:55:50,704 --> 00:55:53,521
[soft tense music]

884
00:55:59,121 --> 00:56:01,680
[jukebox music]

885
00:56:06,801 --> 00:56:09,585
That's as pretty as
she's getting, Potter.

886
00:56:09,617 --> 00:56:11,024
It's airy that,

887
00:56:11,056 --> 00:56:13,392
are this Mexican standoff.

888
00:56:13,425 --> 00:56:15,760
[gun cocks]
[slow suspenseful music]

889
00:56:15,793 --> 00:56:17,776
[Lex] We ain't really
in the mood for Mexican.

890
00:56:17,809 --> 00:56:18,704
Lex.

891
00:56:20,112 --> 00:56:21,264
Grady.

892
00:56:21,297 --> 00:56:23,313
Still quiet as
a damn door mouse.

893
00:56:23,344 --> 00:56:25,616
Yeah, and you're
still dumb as one.

894
00:56:25,649 --> 00:56:28,113
He's smart enough
to count, bushwhacker.

895
00:56:28,144 --> 00:56:29,552
You're still outgunned.

896
00:56:29,585 --> 00:56:32,913
Well, only if you're
counting men of low caliber.

897
00:56:32,944 --> 00:56:34,801
See Captain, the buckle
bunny behind you,

898
00:56:34,833 --> 00:56:37,361
he's got a .25 to the
back of your head,

899
00:56:37,392 --> 00:56:39,601
which for close quarters,

900
00:56:39,633 --> 00:56:41,201
it ain't a bad choice.

901
00:56:41,232 --> 00:56:44,560
As the .25 has enough force
to penetrate the skull,

902
00:56:44,593 --> 00:56:46,800
but not enough
sufficient velocity

903
00:56:46,832 --> 00:56:49,712
to cleanly egress
the other side,

904
00:56:49,745 --> 00:56:51,792
causing the bullet to ricochet,

905
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:54,608
it'll scramble your
brains like an egg.

906
00:56:55,761 --> 00:56:59,441
But this this .45
on the other hand,

907
00:57:00,944 --> 00:57:03,312
well that's another
matter entire.

908
00:57:04,497 --> 00:57:07,760
[slow suspenseful music]

909
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,968
Pop.
[guns firing]

910
00:57:17,329 --> 00:57:20,048
[horses neighing]

911
00:57:21,585 --> 00:57:22,960
Jesus.

912
00:57:22,993 --> 00:57:24,080
Is everybody all right?

913
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:26,993
Yeah.

914
00:57:28,017 --> 00:57:28,944
Found an arrowhead.

915
00:57:31,121 --> 00:57:33,777
[Sully groaning]

916
00:57:35,825 --> 00:57:36,657
It's a warrior.

917
00:57:37,841 --> 00:57:38,610
The head will be barbed.

918
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,856
We can't pull it out.

919
00:57:39,888 --> 00:57:41,745
Okay, then what
do you recommend?

920
00:57:41,776 --> 00:57:43,184
Quit getting hit by arrows.

921
00:57:44,977 --> 00:57:45,777
Noted.

922
00:57:46,897 --> 00:57:49,170
Look, if we're
not able to pull,

923
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,385
we're gonna have to push.

924
00:57:53,072 --> 00:57:54,544
You want something
to bite down on?

925
00:57:55,377 --> 00:57:56,817
Just do it.

926
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:58,096
Ready.

927
00:57:58,128 --> 00:58:00,177
[Sully breathing heavily]

928
00:58:00,208 --> 00:58:01,872
[Sully groaning]

929
00:58:01,905 --> 00:58:04,688
[mysterious music]

930
00:58:08,113 --> 00:58:10,960
[crickets chirping]

931
00:58:28,369 --> 00:58:29,104
They get deep?

932
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,600
[Sully] Deep enough.

933
00:58:36,049 --> 00:58:37,681
When'd you get that?

934
00:58:37,712 --> 00:58:39,632
To the victors
belong the spoils.

935
00:58:42,128 --> 00:58:42,930
Uh uh.

936
00:58:46,192 --> 00:58:46,992
How is he?

937
00:58:48,048 --> 00:58:48,848
Lucky.

938
00:58:51,984 --> 00:58:53,425
Is he gonna be able to ride?

939
00:58:54,321 --> 00:58:56,241
I know I wouldn't but,

940
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,024
I mean he's Captain
by God Potter, so.

941
00:59:01,425 --> 00:59:03,985
Captain Potter ain't
exactly Captain Potter lately.

942
00:59:05,105 --> 00:59:06,481
I mean I know ain't
nobody asking me,

943
00:59:06,512 --> 00:59:08,528
but that blonde haired
gal back in the world,

944
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,417
he's got his head
on back to front.

945
00:59:12,177 --> 00:59:12,945
You're right.

946
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,537
No one's asking you.

947
00:59:18,705 --> 00:59:22,385
Well, going on
fighting now anyways, so.

948
00:59:22,416 --> 00:59:23,888
Yeah, till somebody comes along

949
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,864
and decides to stick their
spoon in our rabbit stew.

950
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,881
No, Grady's an old fuck.

951
00:59:28,914 --> 00:59:30,352
He's an old fuck with a point.

952
00:59:31,344 --> 00:59:32,785
I ain't got no stones to throw.

953
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,041
Captain's sleeping.

954
00:59:38,514 --> 00:59:39,409
So should we.

955
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,888
I'll take the first watch.

956
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:54,288
How far to La Mojarra?

957
00:59:55,664 --> 00:59:56,528
40 mile,

958
00:59:57,584 --> 00:59:58,896
as the crow flies.

959
00:59:59,792 --> 01:00:01,041
be some hard miles.

960
01:00:04,273 --> 01:00:05,680
I just don't want
to get boxed in

961
01:00:05,712 --> 01:00:07,217
'cause them Comanche
gonna treat us

962
01:00:07,249 --> 01:00:08,944
like we're fish in a barrel.

963
01:00:08,977 --> 01:00:11,121
You won't have to
worry about the Comanche.

964
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:15,152
The way to La Mojarra is cursed.

965
01:00:15,184 --> 01:00:17,104
And they won't come near it.

966
01:00:17,136 --> 01:00:19,697
To even speak its name is
considered bad medicine.

967
01:00:23,216 --> 01:00:26,577
Darker things than the
Comanche live in those canyons.

968
01:00:32,496 --> 01:00:33,265
Well,

969
01:00:34,928 --> 01:00:35,920
sweet dreams.

970
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,640
[animal crying]

971
01:00:44,272 --> 01:00:46,769
My grandmother
lived a hundred years

972
01:00:47,665 --> 01:00:48,945
in these mountains.

973
01:00:51,056 --> 01:00:53,489
She used to tell me that
was the cry of la Llorona,

974
01:00:54,705 --> 01:00:57,424
the ghost of a long dead mother

975
01:00:57,456 --> 01:01:00,017
looking for her lost children.

976
01:01:00,049 --> 01:01:01,041
That's fascinating.

977
01:01:02,704 --> 01:01:04,688
And your grandmother
lived to a hundred years

978
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,984
and she never heard
of a mountain lion.

979
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:13,264
Well. [chuckles]

980
01:01:13,297 --> 01:01:16,112
There's not much room in your
world for wonder, is there?

981
01:01:17,489 --> 01:01:19,217
If by wonder you mean
superstitious horse shit,

982
01:01:19,249 --> 01:01:21,041
no, I expect not.

983
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,721
Do you ever go to
sleep with one arm

984
01:01:24,752 --> 01:01:26,865
dangling over the
side of your bed?

985
01:01:32,336 --> 01:01:33,296
And why not?

986
01:01:36,594 --> 01:01:38,096
Deep in our hearts,

987
01:01:38,128 --> 01:01:39,505
no matter how old we get,

988
01:01:40,624 --> 01:01:42,001
we still know there are monsters

989
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:43,568
in the dark places of the world.

990
01:01:45,616 --> 01:01:48,145
My ancestors just
called them gods.

991
01:01:48,177 --> 01:01:50,224
Your ancestors probably
should have sent a few prayers

992
01:01:50,256 --> 01:01:51,568
in some other directions too,

993
01:01:51,601 --> 01:01:53,265
'cause when the end came,

994
01:01:54,641 --> 01:01:56,625
it sure wasn't shiploads
of monsters what done it.

995
01:01:58,128 --> 01:01:58,928
Was it not?

996
01:02:05,104 --> 01:02:07,217
That look in your eye.

997
01:02:07,249 --> 01:02:08,049
Yeah?

998
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:10,704
What look is that?

999
01:02:10,736 --> 01:02:12,849
It's the look
of every white man

1000
01:02:14,448 --> 01:02:17,040
as if you own anything
you can stick a flag into,

1001
01:02:18,352 --> 01:02:20,721
as if it's your natural right
to fuck the whole world.

1002
01:02:21,585 --> 01:02:23,184
Not the whole world, cupcake.

1003
01:02:24,497 --> 01:02:26,992
Just certain dark
little crevices of it.

1004
01:02:27,024 --> 01:02:28,081
I'm a grieving widow.

1005
01:02:28,112 --> 01:02:28,912
I don't care.

1006
01:02:31,313 --> 01:02:33,009
Maybe that makes me a
wicked son of a bitch,

1007
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:33,904
but you know what?

1008
01:02:35,025 --> 01:02:36,688
I don't really care
about that either.

1009
01:02:39,568 --> 01:02:40,528
You gonna fight me?

1010
01:02:42,705 --> 01:02:43,952
Would fighting stop you?

1011
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:48,625
[mysterious music]

1012
01:02:56,528 --> 01:02:59,889

[Sully grunting]

[Lex grunting]

1016
01:04:29,936 --> 01:04:32,464
I will see you
buried for this.

1017
01:04:34,993 --> 01:04:37,392
You better find some
big fucking mariachis.

1018
01:04:43,088 --> 01:04:44,593
What the fuck is your problem?

1019
01:04:45,649 --> 01:04:46,737
What's wrong with me?

1020
01:04:48,048 --> 01:04:49,776
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1021
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:52,912
Go back to your
tent, sleep it off.

1022
01:04:52,944 --> 01:04:55,345
[tense music]

1023
01:04:56,496 --> 01:04:58,704
You know, I'm getting
real sick of your shit.

1024
01:05:01,936 --> 01:05:03,280
What'd you say, sergeant?

1025
01:05:05,873 --> 01:05:07,248
I'm sorry.

1026
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,681
I'm getting real sick
of your shit, sir.

1027
01:05:11,536 --> 01:05:12,689
You know,

1028
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,672
I'm glad you got
a home sweet home

1029
01:05:14,704 --> 01:05:16,305
waiting for you
back in the world.

1030
01:05:16,336 --> 01:05:18,512
But I frankly don't
understand why the rest of us

1031
01:05:18,544 --> 01:05:20,400
have got to walk the
straight and narrow

1032
01:05:20,432 --> 01:05:21,777
just because you found Jesus

1033
01:05:21,809 --> 01:05:24,464
between some farm girls' thighs.

1034
01:05:24,496 --> 01:05:27,729
[fists thudding]

1035
01:05:27,761 --> 01:05:29,296
That's enough.

1036
01:05:29,328 --> 01:05:31,216
This ain't your fight, coward.

1037
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:34,609
Wolf hound, my ass.

1038
01:05:34,641 --> 01:05:36,273
[suspenseful music]
[gun cocks]

1039
01:05:36,305 --> 01:05:38,896
I'm about to wolf
hound your ass.

1040
01:05:38,928 --> 01:05:40,784
I'm about to wear
you like a damn boot.

1041
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:42,480
God damn.

1042
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:45,073
That there,

1043
01:05:46,801 --> 01:05:48,400
that's the Cook I remember.

1044
01:05:49,777 --> 01:05:53,328
Now put that prissy little
thing back in its holster.

1045
01:05:54,449 --> 01:05:59,249
And the derringer too. [laughs]

1046
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:34,544
[Sully groans]

1047
01:06:44,465 --> 01:06:46,864
I may have
misspoken when I said

1048
01:06:46,896 --> 01:06:48,689
you are all arrogant pups.

1049
01:06:54,385 --> 01:06:56,592
I may have misspoken
when I said we weren't.

1050
01:07:04,657 --> 01:07:05,680
Where are we?

1051
01:07:06,865 --> 01:07:09,329
It's only been a few hours.

1052
01:07:09,361 --> 01:07:10,992
We're still at camp.

1053
01:07:21,487 --> 01:07:22,289
Where were you?

1054
01:07:26,769 --> 01:07:27,729
On a farm.

1055
01:07:30,929 --> 01:07:32,529
What kind of farm?

1056
01:07:35,313 --> 01:07:37,711
Potatoes or some damn thing.

1057
01:07:41,456 --> 01:07:43,761
I might try that after the war.

1058
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:44,784
See if I can

1059
01:07:48,336 --> 01:07:49,905
make something
live for a change.

1060
01:07:58,609 --> 01:08:00,816
I'm sorry for Lex.

1061
01:08:09,391 --> 01:08:13,553
So is his behavior
is unexpected then?

1062
01:08:15,025 --> 01:08:15,985
Out of character?

1063
01:08:18,609 --> 01:08:20,656
You travel with a
pack of rabid dogs

1064
01:08:20,689 --> 01:08:22,097
and apologize when they bite.

1065
01:08:23,887 --> 01:08:25,104
You think they
picked us for this

1066
01:08:25,137 --> 01:08:26,097
'cause we're heroes?

1067
01:08:31,665 --> 01:08:33,169
They picked us 'cause we ain't.

1068
01:08:34,416 --> 01:08:36,721
[soft music]

1069
01:08:39,504 --> 01:08:43,185
I know this treasure is
sacred to your people,

1070
01:08:44,593 --> 01:08:46,992
and legends about the gods,
that's a holy thing for you.

1071
01:08:49,585 --> 01:08:50,800
Me and Lex, we...

1072
01:08:56,336 --> 01:08:57,552
If there was a
righteous god in heaven

1073
01:08:57,585 --> 01:09:00,080
he never would've
made men like us.

1074
01:09:00,113 --> 01:09:02,352
[soft music]

1075
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:17,073
Tell me more about this farm.

1076
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,600
[ominous music]

1077
01:10:09,169 --> 01:10:10,801
[Ninekiller]
That's interesting.

1078
01:10:13,105 --> 01:10:15,697
[Cook] This area plays
hell on navigation.

1079
01:10:15,729 --> 01:10:18,000
[Sully] Probably an
iron deposit in the rocks.

1080
01:10:18,031 --> 01:10:18,929
[Ninekiller] Probably.

1081
01:10:20,241 --> 01:10:22,224
[Cook] Gonna have to
take the old Indian trails.

1082
01:10:55,601 --> 01:10:58,768
[slow suspenseful music]

1083
01:11:04,208 --> 01:11:08,849
- [horse neighing]
- Easy, easy, easy, easy.

1084
01:11:10,417 --> 01:11:13,553
[slow suspenseful music]

1085
01:11:13,585 --> 01:11:14,545
What is all this?

1086
01:11:16,721 --> 01:11:17,745
13th Calvary,

1087
01:11:19,568 --> 01:11:21,200
the final stand.

1088
01:11:21,233 --> 01:11:22,448
Looks like them Union fellas

1089
01:11:22,481 --> 01:11:23,697
beat us here after all.

1090
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,929
Race ain't always to
a swift though, is it?

1091
01:11:30,673 --> 01:11:33,936
[slow suspenseful music]

1092
01:11:37,968 --> 01:11:40,944
They were firing
in all directions.

1093
01:11:42,064 --> 01:11:44,080
Looks like they shot
each other to pieces.

1094
01:11:45,425 --> 01:11:47,089
Let's scout ahead.

1095
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,432
I don't want complications.

1096
01:11:50,225 --> 01:11:51,664
Then you're gonna hate this.

1097
01:12:01,008 --> 01:12:01,808
Keller.

1098
01:12:03,857 --> 01:12:05,264
How many?

1099
01:12:05,296 --> 01:12:06,289
[Sully] I count 20.

1100
01:12:07,472 --> 01:12:10,768
[slow suspenseful music]

1101
01:13:05,424 --> 01:13:10,224
[door rumbling]
[dramatic music]

1102
01:13:48,305 --> 01:13:49,808
The Hell's Mouth.

1103
01:13:56,048 --> 01:13:58,480
Post a guard here
and call the others.

1104
01:13:58,513 --> 01:13:59,730
We're going in.

1105
01:14:01,905 --> 01:14:05,200
[slow suspenseful music]

1106
01:14:10,512 --> 01:14:12,561
So what now, oh
fearless leader?

1107
01:14:15,824 --> 01:14:17,392
What happened with the 13th?

1108
01:14:17,424 --> 01:14:19,056
We got to the door and
couldn't get through it.

1109
01:14:19,088 --> 01:14:21,457
Sun went down, the
creatures came.

1110
01:14:22,321 --> 01:14:23,536
Things come out to feed.

1111
01:14:24,657 --> 01:14:25,776
You got any plans
up your sleeve,

1112
01:14:25,808 --> 01:14:26,672
now's the time.

1113
01:14:27,696 --> 01:14:28,465
He's right.

1114
01:14:30,224 --> 01:14:32,048
Whatever we do, we
must do it quickly.

1115
01:14:33,392 --> 01:14:36,145
Under no circumstances
can we be in this place

1116
01:14:36,177 --> 01:14:37,296
when the sun sets.

1117
01:14:39,537 --> 01:14:41,617
That's less than an hour.

1118
01:14:41,648 --> 01:14:44,624
[creatures growling]

1119
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:48,112
Here comes that
sinking feeling.

1120
01:14:48,144 --> 01:14:49,393
Should we evacuate?

1121
01:14:49,424 --> 01:14:50,353
I think I just did.

1122
01:14:50,384 --> 01:14:51,921
What are your orders, Captain?

1123
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,921
- Sully?
- We should go, Captain.

1124
01:14:55,952 --> 01:14:57,265
It's just another dead end.

1125
01:14:58,768 --> 01:14:59,888
Door's open.

1126
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:01,681
Yeah, with a full
hostile company inside,

1127
01:15:01,712 --> 01:15:04,080
plus whatever the hell did that.

1128
01:15:04,112 --> 01:15:05,776
Door like that's
worse than a wall.

1129
01:15:06,704 --> 01:15:07,504
He's right.

1130
01:15:08,368 --> 01:15:09,648
Staying out here's suicide.

1131
01:15:10,576 --> 01:15:11,760
We should get out of here.

1132
01:15:11,792 --> 01:15:13,489
I'm not going anywhere.

1133
01:15:13,521 --> 01:15:14,577
I've been down that path before.

1134
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:16,017
I know where it leads.

1135
01:15:16,048 --> 01:15:17,745
And when the sun goes down
and those creatures come,

1136
01:15:17,776 --> 01:15:19,057
what do you plan to do then?

1137
01:15:19,088 --> 01:15:22,000
I plan on showing them
how a wolf can fight.

1138
01:15:22,033 --> 01:15:22,832
All right.

1139
01:15:24,752 --> 01:15:26,065
I guess we all get
to leave this world

1140
01:15:26,097 --> 01:15:27,472
the same way we came into it,

1141
01:15:28,849 --> 01:15:32,945
surrounded by large unknown
creatures and screaming.

1142
01:15:34,770 --> 01:15:36,912
[Sully] We still
got all that TNT?

1143
01:15:36,945 --> 01:15:37,745
Yeah.

1144
01:15:38,992 --> 01:15:39,792
Why?

1145
01:15:43,217 --> 01:15:45,808
If we can't pull,
we gotta push.

1146
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:48,817
[ominous music]

1147
01:15:48,848 --> 01:15:51,248
[tense music]

1148
01:16:06,992 --> 01:16:09,616
[dramatic music]

1149
01:16:17,010 --> 01:16:18,834
Here, get these placed.

1150
01:16:21,392 --> 01:16:23,920
You can get down there and
get us to the third piece?

1151
01:16:25,008 --> 01:16:25,776
Okay.

1152
01:16:25,808 --> 01:16:26,610
All right.

1153
01:16:28,272 --> 01:16:29,137
Keller's riding blind.

1154
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:30,832
He thinks we're dead and buried.

1155
01:16:30,864 --> 01:16:33,904
That and Dolorosa,
only advantages we got.

1156
01:16:33,937 --> 01:16:35,217
So we get in there,
we get the piece,

1157
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:36,081
we run like hell.

1158
01:16:38,576 --> 01:16:39,889
Cook.

1159
01:16:39,921 --> 01:16:40,720
Cook.

1160
01:16:41,712 --> 01:16:42,834
You be out here.

1161
01:16:42,865 --> 01:16:44,208
You'll have your hand
on this detonator.

1162
01:16:44,241 --> 01:16:45,232
As soon as we're
out that cave mouth,

1163
01:16:45,264 --> 01:16:46,417
you blow it straight to hell.

1164
01:16:46,448 --> 01:16:48,304
You bring this whole
goddamn mountain down.

1165
01:16:49,393 --> 01:16:50,896
We'll show Keller what
buried looks like.

1166
01:16:50,928 --> 01:16:55,345
Captain, this only works
if we can outrun them.

1167
01:16:56,369 --> 01:16:57,904
He's right.

1168
01:16:57,937 --> 01:16:58,801
You'll slow us down.

1169
01:16:58,832 --> 01:17:00,049
And we're burning daylight.

1170
01:17:00,081 --> 01:17:00,913
Four of us go in.

1171
01:17:07,472 --> 01:17:10,032
[ominous music]

1172
01:17:28,914 --> 01:17:29,681
Hold the door.

1173
01:17:32,721 --> 01:17:36,048
[ominous music continues]

1174
01:17:44,274 --> 01:17:46,672
[eerie music]

1175
01:18:16,753 --> 01:18:18,000
They went the wrong way.

1176
01:18:19,472 --> 01:18:20,272
Follow me.

1177
01:18:25,232 --> 01:18:27,281
Smells like a damn tomb.

1178
01:18:28,848 --> 01:18:31,217
[eerie music]

1179
01:18:48,625 --> 01:18:51,184
[bat squeaking]

1180
01:19:12,241 --> 01:19:14,800
[ominous music]

1181
01:20:07,696 --> 01:20:10,257
[intense music]

1182
01:20:24,944 --> 01:20:26,161
Fucking eureka.

1183
01:20:27,056 --> 01:20:28,560
Well, well, well.

1184
01:20:32,816 --> 01:20:34,512
You ever get the
feeling of deja vu?

1185
01:20:38,352 --> 01:20:39,665
Didn't you just say that?

1186
01:20:41,873 --> 01:20:43,409
I'm surprised to see you here.

1187
01:20:44,785 --> 01:20:47,024
Well, I'm surprised
you're surprised.

1188
01:20:48,401 --> 01:20:52,081
Long dark tunnels are
right up my alley.

1189
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:54,225
Then we'll just bury
you deeper this time.

1190
01:21:10,064 --> 01:21:14,864
[ominous music]
[creatures snarling]

1191
01:21:18,353 --> 01:21:19,985
I believe that's my exit music,

1192
01:21:20,017 --> 01:21:21,712
final bow for the rest of you.

1193
01:21:21,744 --> 01:21:23,407
If the ruins are to be believed,

1194
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:25,105
I'm afraid this
amulet's the only thing

1195
01:21:25,137 --> 01:21:26,287
that can keep one safe

1196
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:27,953
from the curse of
the Aztec gold.

1197
01:21:29,104 --> 01:21:31,409
Wonder how it fares
against Kentucky led?

1198
01:21:31,441 --> 01:21:32,529
[gun cocks]

1199
01:21:32,561 --> 01:21:33,553
[gun firing]

1200
01:21:33,585 --> 01:21:36,944
[shot echoing]
[body thudding]

1201
01:21:36,976 --> 01:21:39,376
[guns firing]

1202
01:21:47,153 --> 01:21:51,953
[creatures screeching]
[dramatic music]

1203
01:22:08,176 --> 01:22:09,297
Get behind me.

1204
01:22:09,329 --> 01:22:11,185
What the hell are you doing?

1205
01:22:11,217 --> 01:22:12,145
Something stupid.

1206
01:22:13,936 --> 01:22:16,593
[dramatic music]

1207
01:22:24,433 --> 01:22:27,153
Well, there's your creatures.

1208
01:22:30,001 --> 01:22:31,857
Damn Indian trick.

1209
01:22:31,889 --> 01:22:34,129
War cry have us
jumping at shadows.

1210
01:22:37,584 --> 01:22:39,247
Let's get the
fuck out of here.

1211
01:22:43,281 --> 01:22:44,241
Where's the woman?

1212
01:22:48,593 --> 01:22:50,481
[Dolorosa] Hurry.

1213
01:22:50,513 --> 01:22:51,441
What happened?

1214
01:22:51,473 --> 01:22:52,977
- Do it.
- Where are the others?

1215
01:22:54,768 --> 01:22:56,688
They're dead.

1216
01:22:56,721 --> 01:22:58,000
What happened?

1217
01:22:59,025 --> 01:23:00,049
They're dead.

1218
01:23:00,081 --> 01:23:02,097
Those [indistinct] are coming.

1219
01:23:02,129 --> 01:23:03,344
They're coming.

1220
01:23:03,376 --> 01:23:04,176
Here.

1221
01:23:06,256 --> 01:23:07,056
Go.

1222
01:23:07,087 --> 01:23:07,889
Go!

1223
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,297
[slow suspenseful music]

1224
01:23:22,929 --> 01:23:23,697
No!

1225
01:23:23,729 --> 01:23:25,809
[bomb booming]

1226
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:28,464
[rocks thudding]

1227
01:23:35,569 --> 01:23:38,353
[kettle whistling]

1228
01:23:42,704 --> 01:23:43,504
Welcome.

1229
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,881
[ominous music]

1230
01:23:58,161 --> 01:24:00,304
What's your name, little one?

1231
01:24:00,337 --> 01:24:01,137
Goldie.

1232
01:24:03,057 --> 01:24:04,591
Well, of course it is.

1233
01:24:08,881 --> 01:24:09,681
Yep.

1234
01:24:10,769 --> 01:24:13,264
What else would King
Midas call his daughter?

1235
01:24:16,433 --> 01:24:18,640
You don't need to be
scared of us, Goldilocks.

1236
01:24:19,793 --> 01:24:23,184
Yeah, your pappy and
us, we go way back.

1237
01:24:24,847 --> 01:24:26,671
We're thick as
thieves, you might say.

1238
01:24:28,848 --> 01:24:30,385
Just keep them hands
flat on the table

1239
01:24:30,416 --> 01:24:31,567
for me there, Captain.

1240
01:24:35,249 --> 01:24:37,200
You know, we used to work
together down in Mexico way

1241
01:24:37,231 --> 01:24:41,361
doing, well, I don't even
know what you'd call it.

1242
01:24:41,393 --> 01:24:42,769
House cleaning, maybe.

1243
01:24:46,321 --> 01:24:49,169
How'd you find this
place without the map?

1244
01:24:49,201 --> 01:24:50,671
We didn't need
to find the map.

1245
01:24:50,704 --> 01:24:51,984
We just needed to find you.

1246
01:24:52,017 --> 01:24:53,551
It's like you say, Captain,

1247
01:24:55,024 --> 01:24:56,688
some assholes are hard to miss.

1248
01:24:58,065 --> 01:25:01,009
Military type, heading out
of Monroe six years ago,

1249
01:25:01,936 --> 01:25:03,664
blonde haired lass in tow.

1250
01:25:05,489 --> 01:25:07,569
Some trails are too cold.

1251
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:08,720
Some are too hot.

1252
01:25:08,753 --> 01:25:10,224
Finally we found us one.

1253
01:25:12,689 --> 01:25:14,064
It was just right.

1254
01:25:17,041 --> 01:25:19,601
[ominous music]

1255
01:25:30,064 --> 01:25:31,793
I swear to God,
I thought you died.

1256
01:25:31,825 --> 01:25:33,072
Well, we did.

1257
01:25:33,105 --> 01:25:33,904
Yeah.

1258
01:25:35,153 --> 01:25:36,912
We actually dug ourselves
out of that hell

1259
01:25:36,945 --> 01:25:37,905
when you left us in,

1260
01:25:39,024 --> 01:25:40,529
we got picked up at the border.

1261
01:25:41,647 --> 01:25:42,961
Federales threw
us in this little

1262
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,000
five by five hole,

1263
01:25:47,153 --> 01:25:48,880
and buried in the
waters of baptism,

1264
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:52,208
now raised to walk
in newness of life.

1265
01:25:55,281 --> 01:25:56,433
There's no gold here.

1266
01:25:57,713 --> 01:25:59,121
The serpent god's treasure,

1267
01:26:00,433 --> 01:26:01,201
you can see that.

1268
01:26:01,233 --> 01:26:02,671
Just look outside.

1269
01:26:05,104 --> 01:26:08,049
There's nothing out there
but damn wheat fields.

1270
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,456
Miles of caves underneath.

1271
01:26:12,497 --> 01:26:13,425
I dug for weeks.

1272
01:26:15,825 --> 01:26:19,344
Well, you're gonna dig
just a little bit more.

1273
01:26:20,849 --> 01:26:23,153
You're gonna walk out
in that moonlight,

1274
01:26:23,184 --> 01:26:25,233
just as naked as the
day you were born.

1275
01:26:26,097 --> 01:26:27,505
You're gonna dig three graves.

1276
01:26:27,536 --> 01:26:28,656
Please.

1277
01:26:28,688 --> 01:26:29,456
Please. [cries]

1278
01:26:29,489 --> 01:26:32,144
[dramatic music]

1279
01:26:36,049 --> 01:26:39,377
You're all three going into
the ground tonight, Captain.

1280
01:26:39,408 --> 01:26:43,281
Now, whether they get
it quick and painless,

1281
01:26:44,433 --> 01:26:46,609
or real slow, like you,

1282
01:26:47,985 --> 01:26:48,945
that's your call.

1283
01:26:50,416 --> 01:26:52,336
But you've scattered your
seed among the thorns

1284
01:26:52,369 --> 01:26:53,968
and tonight you're
gonna reap it.

1285
01:26:57,777 --> 01:26:59,216
You're gonna reap it in spades.

1286
01:27:01,584 --> 01:27:03,120
You do what you want to to me,

1287
01:27:04,049 --> 01:27:05,232
you leave my family out of this.

1288
01:27:05,265 --> 01:27:06,991
Hurting them, that ain't fair.

1289
01:27:07,025 --> 01:27:08,785
You buried the
three of us alive.

1290
01:27:08,816 --> 01:27:09,584
Cook, I didn't know you-

1291
01:27:09,616 --> 01:27:10,736
- You buried us alive!

1292
01:27:12,208 --> 01:27:13,393
Now we're gonna bury you.

1293
01:27:15,728 --> 01:27:17,585
Couldn't get more fair.

1294
01:27:20,209 --> 01:27:21,521
Fucking circular.

1295
01:27:22,929 --> 01:27:26,225
[slow suspenseful music]

1296
01:27:28,241 --> 01:27:29,521
Did you kill my dog?

1297
01:27:31,056 --> 01:27:33,520
[Lex snickers]

1298
01:27:36,689 --> 01:27:39,857
That dog ain't the
only bitch of yours

1299
01:27:39,888 --> 01:27:42,768
we're gonna be
putting down tonight.

1300
01:27:45,265 --> 01:27:47,889
[dramatic music]

1301
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:54,481
[tense music]

1302
01:28:13,296 --> 01:28:17,201
[gun fires]
[Lex yelling]

1303
01:28:17,232 --> 01:28:22,032
[dramatic music]
[fists thudding]

1304
01:28:22,961 --> 01:28:25,264
[kid crying]

1305
01:28:29,648 --> 01:28:31,953
[gun firing]

1306
01:28:39,152 --> 01:28:40,688
Come on, come on.

1307
01:28:42,417 --> 01:28:43,185
No.

1308
01:28:43,216 --> 01:28:45,776
[hand slapping]

1309
01:28:47,985 --> 01:28:49,585
[glass shattering]

1310
01:28:49,616 --> 01:28:52,881
[slow suspenseful music]

1311
01:28:54,608 --> 01:28:56,848
[gun cocks]

1312
01:28:56,881 --> 01:28:57,744
You're right
about them monsters

1313
01:28:57,777 --> 01:28:59,345
under your bed, Goldilocks.

1314
01:29:01,584 --> 01:29:04,272
You're not the
monster I heard.

1315
01:29:04,305 --> 01:29:06,161
[ominous music]

1316
01:29:06,192 --> 01:29:08,976
[monster snarling]

1317
01:29:21,264 --> 01:29:24,272
[Lex screaming]

1318
01:29:24,305 --> 01:29:26,929
[dramatic music]

1319
01:29:41,457 --> 01:29:44,240
[monster growling]

1320
01:30:12,848 --> 01:30:13,648
Told you.

1321
01:30:19,825 --> 01:30:22,448
[dramatic music]
