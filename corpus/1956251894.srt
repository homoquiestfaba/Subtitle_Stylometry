1
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,732
- Yo, Tommy!
- Hey, taxi!

2
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,408
Cigars. Cigarettes.

3
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,412
Great idea.

4
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:26,086
Hello, New York.
I'm Bobby Rydell, and I'm glad to be here.

5
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,091
Thank you all
for coming to see us tonight.

6
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,760
It's Saturday night at the Copa.

7
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,429
We think you're gonna have
a great time tonight.

8
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,431
We're gonna do our best
to make sure of that.

9
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:43,228
As always, a very special thanks
to Mr. Jules Podell for having us out.

10
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:44,938
Let's get started.

11
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,576
Cigars? Cigarettes?

12
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,620
Thanks, doll.

13
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,711
Cigars?

14
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,470
Hello, sweetheart.

15
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,849
Here's my coat. And you see this here hat?

16
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,184
I want you to guard it with your life.

17
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,145
It was a gift from my mother.

18
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,063
Yes, Mr. Loscudo.

19
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:30,817
- Here, that's for you.
- Thank you, sir.

20
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,695
- Gio!
- Hey, Carmine.

21
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,447
- How are you, pally?
- Good to see you.

22
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,991
Thank you. That's unnecessary.

23
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,951
Come on, let's go. Andiamo.

24
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:43,496
I saw this kid Bobby Rydell
two and a half years ago in South Philly.

25
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,081
Nobody knew who he was.

26
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,291
They know him now.

27
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,252
Hey, give me Loscudo's hat.

28
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,504
- But he said to guard it.
- I know. I heard.

29
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,465
Give it to me, all right?

30
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:54,924
Come on.

31
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,558
Hey, be respectful and watch your mouth.

32
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,602
Shut up.
She works here, all right, tough guy?

33
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,895
Yeah, what are you gonna do?

34
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,649
Tony Lip!

35
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,674
You put your hands on me, you punk?

36
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,968
Do yourself a favor,
go home with your friends.

37
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,471
You don't tell me where to go.
You know who I am?

38
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,889
I'm going back in there.

39
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,627
You tell Juley Podell
if I don't get my hat,

40
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,421
I'm gonna burn this joint down!
You hear me?

41
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,423
Joe, it's gonna turn up.
I swear to God it's gonna turn up.

42
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,382
- Really?
- It'll turn up.

43
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,925
You tell that fat Jew bastard,

44
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,261
I don't get my hat,
I'll burn the Copa down.

45
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,102
I'm gonna have to go back
to driving garbage trucks.

46
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,521
Jesus Christ.

47
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,023
Loscudo's out of his mind.

48
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,777
We earned our money tonight.

49
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,946
Lip,
I thought you were gonna kill that guy.

50
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,115
- Yeah.
- Better him than me.

51
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,119
So, what are you gonna do
while we're closed?

52
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,956
I don't know.
Maybe go work at my uncle's pizza joint.

53
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,667
You?

54
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,002
I'm gonna drink for two months.

55
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,759
Take me home, Lip.

56
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,720
- Hey, good luck.
- You, too.

57
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,846
See you, Carmine.

58
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,473
No, you shouldn't...
That should not happen.

59
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,640
No, I don't want to be a...

60
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,643
My hat.

61
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:15,064
Heard it was missing, so I looked into it.

62
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,400
I wanted to kill that broad.

63
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,235
No, no. It wasn't her fault.

64
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,654
Who had the balls to clip Gio's hat?

65
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,740
Don't worry about it. I took care of it.

66
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,492
Yeah, I hope you gave him some beating.

67
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,662
Here. Take this. Put it in your kick.

68
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:33,583
No. No, thanks.
It was a pleasure, Mr. Loscudo, really.

69
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,293
Bullshit. Take it.

70
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,172
And from now on,
you don't call me "Mr. Loscudo."

71
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,089
You hear me?

72
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,508
I'm your pal Gio.

73
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,260
Morning.

74
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,846
Good night.

75
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,974
One down,
and the batter will be Roger Maris.

76
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,268
- We need to get back in this.
- The pitch to Maris. Curveball.

77
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,312
Come on, Roger. Come on.

78
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,023
Come on, Roger, hit one out!

79
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,190
- Let's do it!
- Johnny, quiet.

80
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,734
- You're gonna jinx it.
- Come on, Roger.

81
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,194
Hey, Johnny.
Think you could yell a little louder?

82
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,614
- Maris is up.
- Yeah, so am I now.

83
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,575
What the hell are all you guys doing here?

84
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,369
- All right.
- We came over to keep Dolores company.

85
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,374
- Come on.
- Tony!

86
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,056
Thank you, ma'am.

87
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,522
- Come on, Roger, please.
- Let's do it, baby.

88
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,650
- I'll walk you out.
- Sure.

89
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,653
We need to get back in this ball game.

90
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,945
- Come on.
- Thank you so much.

91
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,197
Any problems, give us a call.

92
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,074
Come on, come on, Roger.

93
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,200
- The 1-2 pitch.
- Come on, baby.

94
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,743
The curve is hit deep into right field.

95
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:22,001
We did it! We got it!

96
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,252
- Yeah!
- There it is!

97
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,297
- All right.
- 3-1, baby. 3-1.

98
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,925
- Coming back.
- Roger, baby, way to go!

99
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,301
- 3-1.
- Way to go!

100
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,596
Do it again. Let's do it again.

101
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,681
Come on, baby.

102
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,767
No, Tony. Go get dressed. We're gonna eat.

103
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,812
All right.

104
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,106
No game seven, no game seven.

105
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,661
From thy bounty, through Christ our Lord.

106
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,663
- Amen.
- Amen.

107
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,917
And if anyone hears of a job for Tony,
let us know.

108
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,794
- Dolor.
- What?

109
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:05,753
Please.

110
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,047
What happened? Did you get fired?

111
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,590
- No.
- No.

112
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,008
The Copa's closing for repairs,

113
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,719
so he just needs something
for a couple of months.

114
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,980
All the people he knows,
he'll find something in no time.

115
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,983
Well, he had a great job
at the sanitation department.

116
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,277
You shouldn't have punched out
the foreman.

117
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:31,404
He shouldn't have woke me up.

118
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,449
That's Tony.

119
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,493
I can't believe they lost.

120
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,078
- Don't worry, don't worry.
- Relax.

121
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,792
That never happened before.

122
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,502
They're gonna win the World Series.

123
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,473
I'm telling you, this is gonna be the
easiest 50 bucks you're ever gonna make.

124
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,724
Yeah, we'll see.

125
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,393
Hey, there they are.

126
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,394
Hi, Johnny.

127
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,438
- Tony, how are you?
- Hey, Paulie. How you doing?

128
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,065
I'm good, I'm good.
So Johnny here tells me

129
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,110
you ate 48 White Castle burgers
all in one sitting.

130
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,987
Cheeseburgers.

131
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,363
You tell him, Frankie.

132
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,406
I don't believe it.

133
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,658
What do we care if you believe it?

134
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,204
Hey, Gorman.
What's the record here for hot dogs?

135
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,247
Eighteen. Fat Paulie.

136
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,041
Why wasn't Lip in on that contest?

137
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,043
What contest? I was hungry.

138
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,837
Well, the bet's simple.

139
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,381
Half a C-note.
Most hot dogs in an hour wins.

140
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,966
With toppings.

141
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,887
- What the hell you weigh?
- 260.

142
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,056
Hey, 2... Your left ass weighs 260.

143
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,683
May my mother-in-law drop dead
on the spot if I'm lying.

144
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,730
- All right. You're on.
- Good.

145
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:54,237
Pick it up, Lip!
The baby elephant just hit 19!

146
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,239
Let's go, Lip! Let's go!

147
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,407
Come on, let's go, Lip!
Let's get this going!

148
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,451
You're embarrassing!

149
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:02,578
You're embarrassing your son!

150
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,580
He is killing you!

151
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,006
Hey, Nicky, you doing your homework?

152
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,424
- Yep.
- Good.

153
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:18,469
Where you been?

154
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,346
Gorman's.

155
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:21,848
I'm making dinner.

156
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,937
Fat Paulie bet me 50 bucks
he could eat more hot dogs than me.

157
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,107
He knocked off 24. Guy's an animal.

158
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,110
Are you crazy? You lost $50?

159
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,112
Dolores, please.

160
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,615
I ate 26.

161
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,205
You are so lucky.

162
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,457
You know that?

163
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,959
Rent is due on Monday.

164
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,549
You gonna get that?

165
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,137
- Yeah?
- Hey, Lip.

166
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,765
Some guy called over here, a doctor.
He's looking for a driver.

167
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,809
- You interested?
- Yeah.

168
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,395
They're interviewing guys
tomorrow afternoon.

169
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:14,942
The address is 881 Seventh Avenue.

170
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:15,985
2:15.

171
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,341
Hey. Excuse me.

172
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,425
We're not open right now,

173
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,844
but you're welcome to purchase tickets
to tonight's performance.

174
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:45,514
Nah, that's all right.
I think I got the wrong address.

175
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,184
But is there a doctor's office in here?

176
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,852
A doctor's office?

177
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,395
Dr. Shirley?

178
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,064
You have the correct address.

179
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,107
Dr. Shirley lives upstairs,
above the hall.

180
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,531
How you doing?

181
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,378
I'm here for the driver job.

182
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,463
Tony Lip.

183
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,925
No "Tony Lip."

184
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,469
No, I should be on there.

185
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,390
No.

186
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,601
I have a Tony Val... Valle-la-la...

187
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,645
Vallelonga. Yeah. That's me.

188
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,899
- Fill it out while you wait.
- What?

189
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,568
Fill it out while you wait.

190
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,987
Yeah.

191
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,094
Have a seat.

192
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:36,083
Mr. Vallelonga. Sorry to keep you waiting.

193
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,629
I'm Dr. Donald Shirley.

194
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,339
Tony.

195
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,258
Yes. Please sit down.

196
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,222
Some place you got here.

197
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,558
Are them horns real?

198
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,727
Elephant tusks, yes.

199
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,563
What about that?

200
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,315
Is that a molar?

201
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,487
- A what?
- A molar, like a shark tooth.

202
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,864
Or a tiger's maybe.

203
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,657
It was a gift.

204
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,244
I thought...
I thought I was going to an office.

205
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,081
They said a doctor needed a driver.

206
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,916
That's all they told you?

207
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,334
Yeah.

208
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,419
Actually,
it's a bit more complicated than that.

209
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,465
Have you ever driven professionally
before?

210
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,218
Yeah. Sanitation.

211
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,053
Garbage trucks.

212
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,847
Plus, I drive my boss home at night.

213
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,643
But I can drive anything.
Limos. Tow trucks.

214
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,478
Snowplows. Whatever.

215
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:40,606
I see. What other experience do you have?

216
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,024
I worked a lot of joints.

217
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,360
Wagon Wheel, Peppermint Lounge, Copa.

218
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,946
- In what capacity?
- What do you mean?

219
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,240
What did you do there?

220
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,661
Public relations.

221
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,915
Well, first of all, Tony,
I'm not a medical doctor.

222
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:58,916
I'm a musician.

223
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,418
You mean, like, songs?

224
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,338
Yes. And I'm about to embark
on a concert tour,

225
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,215
the majority of which will be down south.

226
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,592
- Atlantic City.
- No.

227
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,344
The Deep South.

228
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,764
First, we're starting in the Midwest,
and then we're taking a hard left.

229
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:17,434
Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee,
and on down through the Delta.

230
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,521
Do you foresee any issues
in working for a black man?

231
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,523
No.

232
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,569
No, no, no. It was just the other day,

233
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,196
me and the wife had a couple
of colored guys over at the house.

234
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,074
For... For drinks.

235
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,244
I see. You're married.

236
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,621
Yeah. Two kids.

237
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,209
I'm not sure this is the proper job
for a married man.

238
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,961
Why? Are we bringing broads?

239
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,174
My point is we'll be gone
for eight straight weeks.

240
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,967
No breaks, right up until Christmas.

241
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,845
You're quite sure you can leave
your family for that long?

242
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:54,930
Depends what you're paying.

243
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,057
A hundred dollars a week
plus room and board.

244
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,518
But let me be crystal clear.

245
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,313
I'm not just hiring a chauffeur.

246
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,357
I need someone
who can handle my itinerary,

247
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,692
be a personal assistant.

248
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:07,860
I need a valet.

249
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,989
I need someone who can launder my clothes
and shine my shoes.

250
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:15,409
Good luck, Doc.

251
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:19,872
Tony.

252
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,130
I had my record label ask around town
to find me the right man.

253
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,883
Your name came up more than once.

254
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,595
You've impressed several people
with your...

255
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,640
innate ability to handle trouble.

256
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,977
And that is why I called
and inquired about your availability.

257
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,360
Okay, here's the deal. I got no problem
being on the road with you.

258
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,486
But I ain't no butler.

259
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,781
I ain't ironing no shirts,
and I'm not polishing nobody's shoes.

260
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,033
You need somebody to get you
from point A to point B?

261
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,118
You need someone to make sure
there's no problems along the way?

262
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:02,414
And believe me, you in the Deep South...
there's gonna be problems.

263
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,001
So, if you want me,
it's a buck and a quarter a week.

264
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,212
Or go hire that little chink
just pranced out of here,

265
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,380
see how far you get.

266
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,093
Well, Mr. Vallelonga...

267
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,304
thank you for stopping by.

268
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,443
Hey, Bobby.

269
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:33,529
Give me a Rheingold.

270
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,114
Ice cold.

271
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,791
Mr. Tony.

272
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,919
Augie asking about you.

273
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,465
- Come on! I'm dying of thirst over here.
- Shut up!

274
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,633
I'm talking.

275
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,388
When?

276
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,473
Now. He in his box.

277
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,251
Tony Lip.

278
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,338
What the hell happened at the Copa?

279
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,923
I hear you almost split a guy's face open.

280
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,469
That guy you hit, Mikey Cerrone,

281
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,512
part of Charlie the Hand's crew.

282
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,515
Guess he should have known better.

283
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:52,024
Hand asked me to look into it.
I spoke to Podell.

284
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:55,778
Whole thing was
over a piece of ass, right?

285
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:57,863
Yeah.

286
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,784
Beef like that should never happen
inside the club.

287
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,869
They were out of line.

288
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,663
So we squashed it.

289
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,460
You looking to earn
a little extra scharole?

290
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,879
I can keep you busy
while the Copa is down.

291
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:15,881
What do I gotta do?

292
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:18,842
Things.

293
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:26,558
Appreciate it, but I want to spend
some time with the family.

294
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,060
Don't be stupid.

295
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,104
You make yourself a few extra bucks,

296
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,482
you buy something nice
for that pretty little wife of yours.

297
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:41,448
Nah, I'm good. I'm flush right now.

298
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:56,672
Here's 50.

299
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,842
Here.
Pay me 60 by New Year's, you get it back.

300
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,054
Hey, Lip.

301
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,765
Everything okay?

302
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,726
What, you got beak trouble, Charlie?

303
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:11,937
Mind your business.

304
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,695
So, come on. I'm dying to hear.
What happened with the doctor interview?

305
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,240
He ain't a real doctor.
He's a piano player.

306
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,869
Well, I don't understand.
Why did they say that he was a doctor?

307
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:31,290
I don't know. I think he's, like,
a doctor of piano playing or something.

308
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,499
You can be that?

309
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,042
I guess.

310
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,295
He lives on top of Carnegie Hall.

311
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,380
You should've seen this place, Dee.

312
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:41,175
It was filled with statues
and all kinds of fancy crap.

313
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,010
And he was sitting
on top of a friggin' throne

314
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:46,221
all dressed up like...
like the king of the jungle bunnies.

315
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,098
He's colored?

316
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,270
Well, you wouldn't last a week with him.

317
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,022
For the right money, I would.

318
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,159
Yeah.

319
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,039
Look...

320
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:13,832
Really?

321
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,918
- Okay.
- Everything okay?

322
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,252
Okay, hang on a sec.

323
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:21,340
It's Dr. Shirley, the piano guy.

324
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,674
He wants to talk to you.

325
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,760
- Me?
- Yeah.

326
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,011
What? No.

327
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,264
- Come on. Take it.
- No. Tony...

328
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,766
Just... Just talk.

329
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,187
Hello?

330
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,567
Good morning, Doctor.
It's nice to talk to you.

331
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:48,367
Well, yes, that is a long time.

332
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:52,454
It is.

333
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,875
Yes. I'm sure.

334
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:58,710
Thank you.

335
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,420
Thank you for calling.

336
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,172
Bye now.

337
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:06,969
What'd he say?

338
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,138
He wanted to know if I'd be okay

339
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:14,017
with him taking my husband away
from his family for two months.

340
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,688
He said he'd pay you what you asked for.

341
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:24,945
Hey.

342
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,365
It's good money.

343
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,325
We need it.

344
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,915
Can't be eating 26 hot dogs every day.

345
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:39,751
I know.

346
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,755
I told him it was okay for you to go.

347
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,969
All right. Hey, look.
So here's the first half of your pay.

348
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,721
You're gonna get the rest
when the tour's over.

349
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,514
No, I gotta get paid every week.

350
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,224
Sorry. That's not how
the record company does it.

351
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,893
We got to have some guarantee
you're gonna finish the job.

352
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,646
Why wouldn't I finish the job?
I took it, didn't I?

353
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:02,149
Well, then we got nothing to worry about.

354
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,528
Here's the deal, Mr. Vallelonga, okay?

355
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,739
It's your job to get Don
to all his tour dates on time.

356
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,325
Now, if he misses any shows,
you're not getting your back end.

357
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,201
- He's not gonna miss any show.
- Good.

358
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,203
You're gonna need this.

359
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:18,123
Now, this is the book
I was telling you about.

360
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:21,001
Sometimes you guys are staying
in the same hotel, sometimes you're not.

361
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,212
- Yeah, the...
- Yeah, yeah.

362
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,298
All right, don't let me down. Let's go.

363
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,184
Marone. Is this the new one?

364
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,894
Yeah, the record company rented it.

365
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,812
- It's nice, huh?
- Beautiful.

366
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:44,399
So, what'd my sister have to say
about you being gone for three weeks?

367
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,651
Eight weeks.

368
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:50,155
10-to-1, you slap this moolie out,
you come home in under a month.

369
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,533
- Come here.
- All right, boys, huddle up.

370
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,661
- Say good-bye to your father.
- Frankie, Nicky. Come here.

371
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,747
All right. You gonna be good boys?

372
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,415
You'll listen to your mother?

373
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,833
Yeah? All right, give me a kiss.

374
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,627
I'm counting on youse.

375
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,214
- Don't go too far.
- We won't.

376
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,345
- Did you go to the AAA for the maps?
- Yes.

377
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:16,765
No. I mean, the record companies
gave me the maps and the itinerary

378
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:17,683
and this thing.

379
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,895
The Negro Motorist's Green Book.

380
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:24,189
Yeah, it lists all the places
coloreds can stay down south.

381
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:27,067
Like, you know, traveling while black.

382
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,777
"Traveling while black"?

383
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,613
Yeah, if you're black
and you gotta travel for some reason.

384
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,199
- Got a special book for that?
- I guess.

385
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:37,452
- Did you pack the iron?
- I ain't lugging no iron, Dee.

386
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,497
- How are you gonna press your pants?
- I'll put 'em under the mattress.

387
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,918
I want you to write me a letter
every chance you get.

388
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:47,546
- I can't write letters.
- Yes, you can.

389
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,131
- I can't write.
- Take you five minutes.

390
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,674
- Promise me.
- It's embarrassing.

391
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:51,967
It ain't gonna be no good.

392
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,678
It's a lot cheaper
than calling long-distance, Tony.

393
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,346
Promise me you're gonna write.

394
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:58,098
I promise.

395
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,812
Dee, put this in the bank today.
It's half my pay.

396
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:08,066
Here. There's a couple of sandwiches
for you and Dr. Shirley.

397
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,652
- Thanks.
- Be careful.

398
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:11,570
I will.

399
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,654
I love you.

400
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:14,781
I love you, too, baby.

401
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:22,497
You better be home for Christmas,
or don't come home at all.

402
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:30,088
I got it, Pop. I got it.

403
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,742
Hey. I'm Tony.

404
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:00,535
His driver.

405
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:01,912
Bum a smoke?

406
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:08,460
Thanks.

407
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,262
So you're the band?

408
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,141
Oleg. Cello.

409
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,310
George. Bass.

410
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,771
And we're not a band. We're a trio.

411
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,774
Trio. Right.

412
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:33,068
Good morning. Excuse me.

413
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,152
Morning.

414
00:27:58,844 --> 00:27:59,928
Thank you, Amit.

415
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,265
Have a wonderful trip, sir.

416
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,003
Tony, the first thing I'd like you to do
when we arrive in the city...

417
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,755
...is check the piano where I'm playing.

418
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,591
Make sure it's a Steinway
as per my contract.

419
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,971
And can you see to it
that there's a bottle of Cutty Sark

420
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,182
in my room every night?

421
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,059
Every night?

422
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:33,146
Well, if you ever need
any help with that.

423
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:34,856
I won't.

424
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,277
10:00 and 2:00 on the wheel, please.

425
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,531
Hey, Doc.

426
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,076
I noticed on the itinerary thing

427
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,537
the last show's on the 23rd of December,
right?

428
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,873
Birmingham, yes. It's a Christmas show.

429
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,876
So, any way we could
maybe hit the road early next morning

430
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,795
so we'd be home in time for Christmas Eve?

431
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:57,921
We'll see.

432
00:29:58,797 --> 00:29:59,673
Appreciate it.

433
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,093
Could you put out the cigarette, please?

434
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,636
Why?

435
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,097
I can't breathe back here.

436
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,017
What are you talking about?

437
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:13,812
Smoke's going in my lungs.
I'm doing all the work here.

438
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:14,813
Thank you.

439
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:08,867
What are you looking at?

440
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,620
You speak German?

441
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,747
That was Russian.

442
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,708
Yeah,
I was stationed in Germany in the army.

443
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,294
I could pick up a little bit
of what you were saying there.

444
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,379
Watch out for them krauts.

445
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,298
They're all snakes.

446
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:26,092
Kennedy should've bombed them
when he had the chance.

447
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:28,219
Plus now them Cuban bastards.

448
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,015
Ain't they supposed to be following us?

449
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,267
They have the itinerary.

450
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,935
As long as they get to the show on time,

451
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,104
I'm not worried about it,
and neither should you.

452
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,648
I ain't worried about nothin'.

453
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,986
In fact, when you see me worried,
you'll know.

454
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,029
- Tony.
- You'll know if I'm worried.

455
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,489
How about some quiet time?

456
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,075
Sure.

457
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,622
It's amazing you said that.

458
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:57,999
"How about some quiet time?"

459
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,794
Dolores, my wife,
used to say that all the time.

460
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,629
Well, not all the time, but, you know.

461
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,464
She says it when
I come home from work sometimes.

462
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,174
You know,
she's been with the kids all day,

463
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,676
and she'll say,
"Tony, how about some quiet time?"

464
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:11,763
Exactly like how you said it.
I mean, it's amazing.

465
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,355
How is that?

466
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,525
Salty.

467
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,655
Have you ever considered
becoming a food critic?

468
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,827
No. Not really.

469
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,370
Why? Is there money in that?

470
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:39,874
I'm just saying you have a marvelous way
with words when describing food.

471
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,001
"Salty."

472
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:45,296
So vivid, one can almost taste it.

473
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,926
Hey, I'm just saying it's salty.
And salt's cheating.

474
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,011
Any cook can make things salty.

475
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,429
To make it taste good without the salt,

476
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,807
with just the other flavors,
that's the trick.

477
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,142
I mean, you take the basic ingredients...

478
00:32:57,225 --> 00:33:00,478
We should get going soon if we expect
to get to Pittsburgh by dinner.

479
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:05,316
Hey, when I was in the army,
I knew a guy from Pittsburgh.

480
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,819
Except he called it Titsburgh.

481
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,030
'Cause he said all the women there
had huge tits.

482
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:13,825
That's absurd.

483
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,994
Why would women in Pittsburgh
have larger breasts

484
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,496
than, say, women in New York?

485
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,873
Guess we'll find out?

486
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:24,460
Hey, you know, when you first hired me,

487
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:27,005
my wife went out
and bought one of your records.

488
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,590
The one about the orphans.

489
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,758
Orphans?

490
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:35,346
Yeah. Cover had a bunch of kids
sitting around a campfire.

491
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,432
Orpheus.

492
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,226
Yeah.

493
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:43,021
Orpheus in the Underworld.
It's based on a French opera.

494
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,481
And those weren't children on the cover.

495
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,026
Those were demons in the bowels of hell.

496
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:52,363
No shit? Must have been naughty kids.

497
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,297
What are... What are you doing?

498
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,632
Gotta take a leak, Doc.

499
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,301
Here? Now?

500
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,011
You want me to piss my pants?

501
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,717
- Hey, Doc.
- Good afternoon.

502
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,595
Take this for any incidentals we may need.

503
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,181
If you want to buy something,
you don't have to ask.

504
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,142
Just keep the receipts, please.

505
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,019
When it runs low, let me know.

506
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,520
Thanks.

507
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:48,980
One more thing.

508
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:55,069
We'll be attending many events
before and after the concerts,

509
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,571
interacting with some of the wealthiest

510
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,614
and most highly educated people
in the country.

511
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,659
It is my feeling that your diction,

512
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,579
however charming it may be
in the tri-state area,

513
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,664
could use some... finessing.

514
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:10,251
You mean diction... like in what way?

515
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,755
Like in the only way
the word is ever used.

516
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:15,757
Okay.

517
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,843
Your intonation, inflection,
your choice of words.

518
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,304
Hey, I got my own problems.

519
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,890
Now I gotta worry about
what people think about the way I talk?

520
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,476
There are simple techniques
I can teach you that are quite effective.

521
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,393
I can help you.

522
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:29,103
I... I don't need no goddamn help.

523
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,356
People don't like the way I talk,
they can go take a shit.

524
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,609
The profanity is another issue.

525
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,195
Fanabola. Why are you breaking my balls?

526
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,155
Because you can do better, Mr. Vallelonga.

527
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,491
Which brings me to one more point.

528
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:45,620
As the guest of honor, I'll be introduced
when entering these intimate events.

529
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,330
You will be introduced as well.

530
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:52,543
In my humble opinion, "Vallelonga"
may be difficult to pronounce.

531
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,879
So, I was thinking

532
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:56,964
"Valle" would be more appropriate.

533
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,634
Tony Valle. Short and sweet.

534
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,803
Nah.

535
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:05,223
They got a problem with "Vallelonga,"
they can call me Tony Lip.

536
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,183
These are genteel people.

537
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,685
"Tony the Lip" may be a little...

538
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,063
worldly for them.

539
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,148
Well, then it's Tony Vallelonga.

540
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:17,777
All these high-class people,
so much smarter than me,

541
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,154
with their intelligence
and speaking abilities,

542
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,864
you're telling me
they can't pronounce my name?

543
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,616
They don't like it,
they can shove it up their ass.

544
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:24,826
I'll just wait outside.

545
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,704
A sound compromise.

546
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:48,224
Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight we are privileged

547
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:51,227
to present a great American artist.

548
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,939
He gave his first public performance
at the age of three.

549
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,568
At age 18, at Arthur Fiedler's invitation,

550
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:02,572
our guest made his concert debut
with the Boston Pops.

551
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:08,286
He holds doctorates in psychology,
in music, and in the liturgical arts,

552
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:12,373
and he has performed at the White House
twice in the past 14 months.

553
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,876
He is a true virtuoso.

554
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,544
- And it's a...
- "Virtuoso."

555
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,880
- It's a special treat for me...
- That's Italian.

556
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,467
Means he's really good.

557
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:28,181
So, ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome the Don Shirley Trio.

558
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,150
...a new pair of shoes!

559
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,530
- Hard ten! Lady's friend.
- He keeps on winning!

560
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,949
It's your dice.
I'm just having a lucky night.

561
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,200
You cheating, brother!

562
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:14,203
- Tony.
- Get him again. Get him again.

563
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,581
- Boss man's calling.
- He ain't my boss.

564
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,999
I work for the record company.

565
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,542
Yeah, I work for the record company, too.

566
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,043
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, come on, man.

567
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,170
Hey, give us a chance
to win back our loot?

568
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,755
I'm sorry, fellas. Duty calls.

569
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,591
- Come on, man.
- Duty calls?

570
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,385
My man, my duty is to get my money back.

571
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,262
I've been looking for you.

572
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,806
Yeah, sorry.
The guys were having a little game.

573
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,934
Next time you need extra money,
just ask me.

574
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,395
It's more fun winning it.

575
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,105
And what if you lost?

576
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,733
Craps and cards, I don't lose, Doc.

577
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,234
I don't lose.

578
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,737
So, stooping down in the gravel,

579
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,947
pitching dice for pocket change
makes you a winner?

580
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,618
What are you giving me shit for?
Everybody was doing it.

581
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:56,579
They didn't have a choice
whether to be inside or out.

582
00:40:58,205 --> 00:40:59,123
You did.

583
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,587
Now wipe off your knees.
You have dirt on them.

584
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,902
Dear Dolores, how are you?

585
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,528
I am fine.

586
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:33,074
"I'm eating real good. Hamburgers mostly.

587
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:36,077
So don't worry about me not eating good.

588
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:40,122
I saw Dr. Shirley play the piano tonight.

589
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,625
He don't play like a colored guy.

590
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,127
He plays like Liberace, but better.

591
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,255
He's like a genius, I think.

592
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,758
When I look at him in the rearview mirror,

593
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,511
I can tell he's always thinking
about stuff in his head.

594
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,846
I guess that's what geniuses do.

595
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,641
But it don't look fun to be that smart.

596
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,395
I miss you very, very much."

597
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:14,031
- Who is this?
- Who?

598
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,574
On the radio.

599
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,160
Little Richard.

600
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:21,163
Really? That's Little Richard?

601
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,164
Yeah.

602
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,125
Think you could play something like that,
Doc?

603
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:28,504
I don't know. Sounds fairly complicated.

604
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,339
Got that right.

605
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,468
So, where did this
"Tony the Lip" moniker come from?

606
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,513
It's not "Tony the Lip."

607
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,807
It's "Tony Lip." One word.

608
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,100
I got it when I was a kid,

609
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:44,437
'cause my friend said I was
the best bullshit artist in the Bronx.

610
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,022
Why are you smiling?

611
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:48,482
What do you mean?

612
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,402
It doesn't bother you that your friends,

613
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,779
the people closest to you,
consider you a liar?

614
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:57,158
Who said "liar"? I said "bullshit artist."

615
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,701
And what's the difference?

616
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,911
'Cause I don't lie. Ever.

617
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,831
I'm just good at talking people into,
you know,

618
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,374
doing things they don't want to do.

619
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,042
By bullshitting them.

620
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,628
And you're proud of that?

621
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,422
Well, it got me this job.

622
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:20,431
Wait a minute. You're full of shit.
You never heard of Chubby Checker?

623
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:23,350
Of course I've heard of him.
I've just never heard his music before.

624
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,103
But I like this. This is nice.

625
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:30,107
- He's got a silky voice, very smooth.
- Yeah, he's terrific.

626
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:31,692
This is what everybody's dancing to now.

627
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,444
- This stuff...
- Eyes on the road, Tony.

628
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:37,907
You know this song.

629
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,201
I don't think so, no.

630
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:43,996
How could you not know this music?
Aretha Franklin.

631
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,708
Chubby Checker, Little Richard, Sam Cooke.

632
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:50,377
I mean, come on, Doc.
These are your people.

633
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:06,936
Do you want anything?
I'm getting a pack of smokes.

634
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:07,978
No, thank you.

635
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,927
Grabbed the rock and put it in his pocket.

636
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:40,970
Thank you, Oleg.

637
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,348
Nice turtleneck. Way to mix it up.

638
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,353
Got you an apple, Doc.

639
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,695
Before we pull out, Tony,
we need to have a talk.

640
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:02,616
- Yeah?
- Oleg told me what you did.

641
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:03,951
What'd I do?

642
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:06,412
You stole a jade stone from the store.

643
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,539
- No, I didn't.
- He watched you do it.

644
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,457
I didn't steal no stone.

645
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,376
You picked it up
and put it in your pocket.

646
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:15,462
I picked up a rock off of the ground.
I didn't steal from a box.

647
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,381
Now, why would you pick up a rock
off the ground?

648
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:18,424
I don't know.

649
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,761
'Cause it ain't stealing.
It's just a regular rock.

650
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,513
And why would you want a regular rock?

651
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:27,725
To have. For luck maybe.

652
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:28,893
A lucky rock.

653
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,394
- Yeah.
- Let me see it.

654
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:46,911
Take it back and pay for it.

655
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,123
I told you that kraut was a snake.

656
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:53,500
Rats me out for something
I didn't even do!

657
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:55,502
Pay for the stone, Tony.
You'll feel better.

658
00:45:55,586 --> 00:46:00,215
I feel fine. And I ain't paying
for no regular rock I found in the dirt.

659
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:03,302
Do not drive, Mr. Vallelonga.

660
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,474
Put it back.

661
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,458
- Feel better?
- No.

662
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,795
If you'd like, Tony,
I'd happily buy you the stone.

663
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,839
Don't bother.
You took all the fun out of it.

664
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,670
Excuse me. Sir.

665
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,090
- I'm with the band.
- You're all set up.

666
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:25,592
This isn't the piano, right?

667
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:26,552
That's it.

668
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,262
It ain't a Steinway.

669
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,264
So what?

670
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:33,225
Dr. Shirley only plays
on Steinway grand pianos.

671
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:34,935
It's in his written contract.

672
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,437
Who's Dr. Shirley?

673
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,607
Dr. Shirley. The Don Shirley Trio.
They're playing tonight.

674
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,900
Does it really matter?

675
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:44,528
Yeah, it does. It's in his contract.

676
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:47,948
Come on, man.

677
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:50,451
These coons can play on anything
you put in front of 'em.

678
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,248
But it's a piece of shit.

679
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:57,875
And there's garbage in there.

680
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,168
So take it out.

681
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,253
What'd you say?

682
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:04,048
You heard me.

683
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:11,889
Hey. You got two, three hours.
Just get a clean Steinway in here.

684
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,808
- There ain't a Steinway on campus.
- Not my problem.

685
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:18,020
I bet there's not two Steinways
in the whole state of Indiana.

686
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,606
I guess you'd better move your ass, then.

687
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,733
Who you think you're talking to,
greaseball?

688
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:54,098
Dear Dolores,

689
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:57,851
this morning I had steak and eggs
for breakfast.

690
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:01,396
The band has been playing
at very ritzy joints.

691
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,399
Dr. Shirley and I
are getting along pretty good.

692
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,527
But sometimes I think he gets sad,

693
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,695
and that's why he drinks too much.

694
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:12,699
I never knew how very beautiful
this country was.

695
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,785
Now that I'm seeing it, I know.

696
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:19,790
You won't believe how beautiful nature is.
It is as beautiful as they say.

697
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,961
And the traffic out here in the country
is nothing, which is fine by me.

698
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:27,631
Right now I'm eating spaghetti
and meatballs in a diner

699
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:30,425
that tastes like ketchup
on Chinese noodles.

700
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,678
We are heading down south now.

701
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,848
I will write you another letter
when we get down south.

702
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,642
I love you. Your husband, Tony.

703
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:40,686
PS. Kiss the kids for me.

704
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,904
Got any family, Doc?

705
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:52,447
Not really.

706
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:55,242
Not really? Either you do or you don't.

707
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,453
It's a long story, Tony.

708
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,455
What, we're in a hurry now?

709
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:03,876
Let's hear it.

710
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,087
I have a brother somewhere.

711
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:10,090
We used to get together once in a while,

712
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:12,801
but it got more and more difficult
to stay in touch.

713
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,679
Curse of being a musician, I guess.

714
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,182
Always on the road.

715
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,726
Like a carnival worker.

716
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,811
Or a criminal.

717
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,731
Took quite the toll
on my marriage as well.

718
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,941
- You're married?
- Was.

719
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,276
June.

720
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:34,031
Good person.
Terrible grammar, but a kind soul.

721
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:35,782
You'd quite like her.

722
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:39,077
June. Like... like Lassie's mom.

723
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:45,751
Unfortunately, I couldn't do a husband act
and a concert pianist act.

724
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,296
Couldn't seem to manage both worlds.

725
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:53,175
Kentucky fried chicken!

726
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,762
In Kentucky!
When's that ever gonna happen?

727
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:09,733
All right!

728
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:12,778
Hey, you want some?

729
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:15,113
- I'm fine. Thank you, Tony.
- All right.

730
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:22,412
I think this is the best
Kentucky fried chicken I ever had.

731
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:24,873
Probably 'cause it's fresher down here,
right?

732
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:27,334
I don't think I've ever met anyone
with your appetite.

733
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,170
No. I got the bucket
so you could have some.

734
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:32,839
I've never had fried chicken in my life.

735
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:34,675
Who you bullshitting?

736
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:38,595
You people love the fried chicken,
the grits, and the collard greens.

737
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:40,180
I love it, too.

738
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:43,350
Negro cooks used to make it all the time
when I was in the army.

739
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,769
You have a very narrow assessment of me,
Tony.

740
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,980
Yeah, right? I'm good.

741
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:51,024
No. No, you're not good. You're bad.

742
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:54,528
I'm saying, just because other Negroes
enjoy certain types of music,

743
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:55,862
it doesn't mean I have to.

744
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:59,616
- Nor do we all eat the same kind of food.
- Wait a minute.

745
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:03,453
If you said all guineas like pizza
and spaghetti and meatballs,

746
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:04,621
I'm not gonna get insulted.

747
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:06,081
You're missing the point.

748
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:08,083
For you to make the assumption
that every Negro...

749
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,793
- Hey, you want some or not?
- No.

750
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:11,295
Here. Come on.

751
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,380
- Tell me that don't smell good.
- It...

752
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,257
It smells okay.

753
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:18,468
I prefer not to get grease on my blanket.

754
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:21,388
I'm gonna get grease on my blankey!

755
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,098
Come on, have a piece.
It ain't gonna kill you.

756
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:24,474
- Come on, take it, eat it.
- No.

757
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,685
Take it. I'm throwing it in the back.

758
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:28,854
- You... Don't you dare.
- Then you better take it.

759
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:31,481
How? Do you have plates or utensils?

760
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,233
Baffangul! Eat it with your hands!

761
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:34,943
- That's how you're supposed to.
- I can't do that.

762
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:37,821
Eat it. Come on. Take it. I gotta drive.
10:00 and 2:00 on the wheel.

763
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:39,239
- Come on. Take it, take it, take it.
- Tony...

764
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:40,324
Come on, come on.

765
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,159
There you go.

766
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:46,246
I... I can't do this, Tony.

767
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:48,290
Eat the goddamn thing!

768
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,250
Jesus.

769
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:01,803
What, no good?

770
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,227
It just seems...

771
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:12,939
so un... unsanitary.

772
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,274
Who gives a shit?

773
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,360
Just relax and enjoy it.

774
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,071
You know, my father used to say...

775
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:22,616
"Whatever you do,
do it a hundred percent."

776
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:25,869
When you work, work.
When you laugh, laugh.

777
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:28,538
When you eat,
eat like it's your last meal.

778
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:32,542
You want another piece?
Here. Have a breast.

779
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:33,835
Delicious.

780
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,505
Take it. Here you go.

781
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:39,049
What do we do about the bones?

782
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,136
We do this.

783
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:46,431
This is what we do.

784
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:55,690
There you go.

785
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:09,788
What's the big deal, Doc?
The squirrels would've ate it anyway.

786
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:10,705
Pick it up, Tony.

787
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,124
Nature takes care of the earth.

788
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:14,000
Pick it up.

789
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,286
This can't be right.

790
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:56,168
It says right here,
"Cozy as your own home."

791
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:59,296
Place looks like my ass.

792
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,047
This is the place.

793
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,181
The square one, please.

794
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,642
- Just this one?
- Thank you.

795
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:19,691
Hey, if you need anything,

796
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:21,651
I'll be right up the street
at the Easton Inn.

797
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:23,653
Thank you, Tony.

798
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:29,784
Hey, Floyd, we ready.

799
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:32,537
I told you I can't play. My shoulder.

800
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:34,164
You and that damn shoulder.

801
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:39,127
Hey! Hey, fancy-pants. You want to play?

802
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,087
I beg your pardon?

803
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,006
Come on, brother. We short a man.

804
00:55:44,216 --> 00:55:45,717
I'd rather not.

805
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:48,595
What, you too high and mighty?

806
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,680
No, no, let him alone. Let him alone.

807
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:53,558
He just afraid of getting
that butler uniform a little dusty.

808
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:57,354
I'm just...

809
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,357
I'm on my way to meet a friend.

810
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,318
Yeah, well, thanks for nothing.

811
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:07,614
Floyd, come on, man.

812
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,699
Shut your ass up, man, and leave me alone!

813
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:47,571
"Vacation without aggravation."

814
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:00,667
"Delightful dinners
for particular people."

815
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,504
- Yeah?
- Get up. It's George.

816
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:05,755
Get up.

817
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:09,134
Tony, come on. Hurry up.

818
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,262
Dr. Shirley's in trouble.

819
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,514
I went out for a drink,
I walk into this bar,

820
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:16,349
and Dr. Shirley's in there
getting bounced around.

821
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:18,852
I didn't want to leave him,
but I didn't know what to do.

822
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,687
Who let him out of his cage?

823
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,564
And they put that little tie on him, too.

824
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:23,857
- Why you all dressed up?
- Yeah.

825
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,569
Get your hands off him.

826
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:33,199
What in the good goddamn we got here,
fellas?

827
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:36,369
Hand him over. We walk out.
Won't be a problem.

828
00:57:36,745 --> 00:57:38,955
I just wanted a drink, Tony.

829
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:40,624
Hey, I told you we'll leave.

830
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,877
- Not a big deal. Come on.
- He ain't going nowhere.

831
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,879
We need a Brillo Pad
to wash these dishes with.

832
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,672
Listen, assholes.

833
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:50,175
Do yourselves a favor and let him go.

834
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:52,093
Now!

835
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:55,639
Say it nice.

836
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,224
I just said it nice.

837
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:01,978
This boy is gonna get
what he's got coming to him.

838
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:07,442
And you, you ain't got no say.

839
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:13,031
Maybe. But whatever happens here,

840
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:16,826
I'm gonna put a bullet
right in the middle of your thick skull.

841
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:21,665
He ain't got no gun, Ray.
He's full of shit.

842
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,042
What if he ain't?

843
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,839
Well, I sure ain't.

844
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:34,302
And I ain't about to let this come to pass
in my place.

845
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,849
Let the spook go. Let him go.

846
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:41,768
Come on.

847
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:44,437
Get him out of here.

848
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:48,233
I want these Yankees off of my property.

849
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,777
- Go on.
- Go on, George. Go. Go.

850
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:51,903
I got you, Doc.

851
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,491
Go on.

852
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,624
You out of your mind?

853
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:08,128
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to put you in that position.

854
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,255
Wait, wait, wait.

855
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,006
Are you gonna throw up again?

856
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:15,927
I'm okay.

857
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:18,263
Honest to God, Doc,
I don't understand you.

858
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:20,807
You could have drunk here.
You got a whole bottle.

859
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:23,017
I just needed some air.

860
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:25,437
Air? Do you know where you are?

861
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,898
Does geography really matter?

862
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:31,192
What?

863
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:34,612
If I was in a bar in your neighborhood,

864
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:38,366
would the conversation be any different?

865
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:43,079
From now on,
you don't go nowhere without me.

866
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:44,914
Nowhere!

867
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:47,751
- Got it?
- I understand.

868
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:50,670
Where's your room?

869
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,130
Tony.

870
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,132
What?

871
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,218
Do you really have a gun?

872
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,137
Of course not.

873
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,932
Doc, where's your goddamn room?

874
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,062
- Come on.
- There it is.

875
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,022
Over there?

876
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:10,899
You gotta get to bed, Doc.

877
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:12,692
You got a big show tomorrow night.
Come on.

878
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:34,881
Thank you.

879
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,299
Louisville.

880
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:38,760
Thank you for your warm hospitality.

881
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,684
Thank you. Thank you.

882
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:56,402
Don't be lazy, Tony. Enunciate.

883
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,655
- I am.
- Betty bought a bit of better butter

884
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:00,573
- to make the bitter butter better.
- Betty bought...

885
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,993
B-Bought...
Betty bought butta-er... butta...

886
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:06,538
Who says that? Butta-er.

887
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:09,249
You have to start somewhere,
Tony. A singer does vocal exercises.

888
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:11,251
An athlete warms up before they rehearse.

889
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,169
Athletes practice.
They don't rehearse.

890
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:17,632
Shit.

891
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:47,513
Ladies and gentlemen,
a very special guest from the far north,

892
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,098
Don Shirley.

893
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:56,814
Accompanying Mr. Shirley,
the members of his trio,

894
01:02:56,898 --> 01:03:00,276
Oleg Malacovich, George Dyer,

895
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:03,112
and his associate Tony Valle...

896
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:05,281
Valle... Vallelong-longia.

897
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,206
This is my lovely wife, Margaret.

898
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:16,000
If you gentlemen don't mind,
we're going to steal Donnie away

899
01:03:16,084 --> 01:03:17,752
for some introductions.

900
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:22,382
I'd like you all to meet Don Shirley.

901
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,926
Yeah. I'll take one.

902
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:27,345
- What's that?
- A pimento-and-cheese sandwich, sir.

903
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,013
Yeah, I'll try one of them.

904
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:32,892
Oof.

905
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:41,317
Sorry. Not for me.

906
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:54,163
Earlier this week, we asked our help
what Mr. Shirley might like for supper.

907
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:58,251
So the boys in the kitchen whipped up
a special menu in honor of our guest.

908
01:03:58,710 --> 01:03:59,627
Gentlemen.

909
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,422
Home-cooked fried chicken.

910
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:10,638
There we go.

911
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:12,932
Bring it in. Serve it up hot.

912
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:45,548
Thank you. Thank you.

913
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:49,218
We'll return after a brief intermission.

914
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:53,473
Excuse me, Don.

915
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:56,601
- Lovely work in there.
- Why, thank you.

916
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:58,311
Are you looking for the commode?

917
01:04:58,394 --> 01:04:59,854
- Yes. I...
- Yeah, here. Let me help you.

918
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:02,231
It's right out there before that pine.

919
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,447
I'd prefer not to use that.

920
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:12,742
Well, don't be silly, Don.
It looks a lot worse from the outside.

921
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:15,495
And I suppose you'd know from experience.

922
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,413
Well, I've never had any complaints.

923
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:25,046
Well, I could return to my motel
and use the facilities there...

924
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:28,549
but that would take
at least a half an hour.

925
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,097
We don't mind waiting.

926
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:39,102
Why don't I just pull over?
You can piss in the woods.

927
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:41,062
Animals go in the woods.

928
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:43,856
It's gonna be at least 20 minutes
I gotta go all the way back to your motel.

929
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,734
So let's just get there
so I can go back and finish the show.

930
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:49,737
See, that's the difference
between you and me.

931
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:51,197
I'd have zero problem going in the woods.

932
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,281
I'm well aware.

933
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:56,369
What are you sore at me for?
I don't make the rules down here.

934
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:59,288
No? Then who does?

935
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:04,293
You're saying
just 'cause I'm white and they're white?

936
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:07,296
You know, that's a very prejudiced thing
you just said there.

937
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,006
A very prejudiced thing.

938
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:11,884
I got more in common with the hymies
at Second Avenue Deli

939
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,970
than I do with these hillbilly pricks
down here.

940
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:15,221
Eyes on the road.

941
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:17,849
You always say that
when you don't like what I'm saying.

942
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:19,350
Eyes on the road.

943
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,189
I don't get it.

944
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:28,025
How does he smile
and shake their hands like that?

945
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:32,822
They try to pull that outhouse shit on me,
I'd piss right on the living room floor.

946
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:35,950
Don't... Don't do that.

947
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:40,746
We have many concert dates left.

948
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:44,917
Yeah? So?

949
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:48,087
You realize we're contractually obliged
to perform them?

950
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:52,592
Of course I do.
You don't play, we don't get paid.

951
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:54,385
What's your point?

952
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:57,680
Ugly circumstances
are going to happen again,

953
01:06:58,389 --> 01:06:59,891
so control yourself.

954
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:02,518
Don't lecture me, you rat.

955
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:07,356
Dr. Shirley could have stayed up north

956
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,110
getting rear end kissed at Park Avenue
parties for three times money.

957
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:13,779
But he ask for this.

958
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:19,660
Why?

959
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:41,349
What on God's green earth are you doing?

960
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:43,142
A letter.

961
01:07:43,809 --> 01:07:45,728
Looks more like a piecemeal ransom note.

962
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,105
May I?

963
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,740
"Dear Dolores."

964
01:07:58,241 --> 01:07:59,325
D-E-A-R.

965
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:00,660
This is an animal.

966
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:04,872
"I'm meeting all
the highly leading citizens of the town.

967
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:09,168
People that use big words, all of them.

968
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:12,088
But you know me. I get by.

969
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:13,756
I'm a good bullshitter."

970
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:15,758
Two T's in "bullshitter."

971
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:20,429
"As I'm writing this letter,
I'm eating potato chips,

972
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,891
and I'm starting to get thirsty.

973
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:27,937
I washed my socks
and dried them on the TV.

974
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:31,065
I should have brung the iron."

975
01:08:31,148 --> 01:08:32,566
You know this is pathetic, right?

976
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,319
Tell me what you're trying to say.

977
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:37,113
I don't know.

978
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:40,199
You know, I miss her and shit.

979
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:41,450
Then say that.

980
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:44,912
But do it in a manner
that no one else has ever done it before.

981
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:46,956
And without the profanity.

982
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:49,667
Something like...

983
01:08:50,751 --> 01:08:51,794
Put this down.

984
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:56,048
Dear Dolores.

985
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:57,508
Hold on. I'll start a new one.

986
01:08:58,592 --> 01:09:01,345
D-E-A-R Dolores.

987
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,182
When I think of you...

988
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:10,771
I'm reminded
of the beautiful plains of Iowa.

989
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:12,440
What planes?

990
01:09:13,065 --> 01:09:14,483
The plains.

991
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:17,695
P-L-A-I-N-S. Those big fields we saw.

992
01:09:17,778 --> 01:09:19,822
Yeah, those were nice.

993
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:21,365
Plains.

994
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:25,578
Which is what they call

995
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:29,165
big fields around here.

996
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:30,875
Tony, no expounding.

997
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,210
- No what?
- Just write what I say.

998
01:09:33,794 --> 01:09:34,837
No good.

999
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:37,840
The distance between us...

1000
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:41,218
is breaking my spirit.

1001
01:09:42,803 --> 01:09:44,180
Between us...

1002
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:48,976
My time and experiences without you
are meaningless to me.

1003
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:56,859
Falling in love with you
was the easiest thing I've ever done.

1004
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:02,031
Falling... in love... with you...

1005
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:04,575
This is very fucking romantic.

1006
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:08,162
...was the easiest thing
I have ever done.

1007
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:10,956
Nothing matters to me but you,

1008
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:14,794
and every day I'm alive,
I'm aware of this.

1009
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:19,048
I loved you the day I met you,
I love you today,

1010
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:22,301
and I will love you the rest of my life.

1011
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,807
So, can I put, "PS. Kiss the kids"?

1012
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:28,891
A PS?

1013
01:10:29,517 --> 01:10:30,559
Yeah, like, at the end.

1014
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:35,606
That's like clanging a cowbell
at the end of Shostakovich's Seventh.

1015
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:39,151
Right. And that's good?

1016
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,238
It's perfect, Tony.

1017
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:49,245
Everybody talks
about Willie Mays, 1954.

1018
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:51,664
It wasn't even the greatest catch
in the Polo Grounds.

1019
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:55,918
That was Joe DiMaggio, 1936,
second game of the World Series.

1020
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:58,712
Final out, 500 feet...

1021
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:03,676
You like that, Doc?

1022
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:05,136
That's a handsome suit.

1023
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:06,637
Sharp.

1024
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:09,014
Guy looks just like you.

1025
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:11,434
He does?

1026
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,438
Well, size-wise. Yeah.

1027
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:19,108
It is about a 42.

1028
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:23,154
Why don't you try it on?

1029
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:25,448
What, you gotta wear a tuxedo
on stage every night?

1030
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:27,867
You could mix it up a little, Doc.

1031
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,494
Come on, let's see how it looks on you.
We got plenty of time.

1032
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:35,082
I'll be right back.

1033
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,419
- How you doing?
- May I help you, sir?

1034
01:11:38,502 --> 01:11:41,589
Yeah, we want to try on that
beautiful gray suit in the window.

1035
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:44,133
- You got it in a 42?
- Of course.

1036
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:48,554
That's the one.

1037
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,473
Dressing room is in the back, sir.

1038
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,392
Thank you. I'll be just a moment.

1039
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:56,270
Take your time, Doc.
I'll check out some ties for you.

1040
01:11:57,897 --> 01:12:01,734
Excuse me.
You're not allowed to try that on.

1041
01:12:04,069 --> 01:12:04,987
I beg your pardon?

1042
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:09,825
Iif you'd like to purchase it first,
we'd be happy to tailor it to your needs.

1043
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:13,370
I see.

1044
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:17,101
Yeah.

1045
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:19,895
That's me.

1046
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:35,202
Hey, Officer.
I got a call about Dr. Shirley.

1047
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:36,996
Come on.

1048
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:43,419
His friend's here.

1049
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:45,963
Thank you.

1050
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:53,053
Get a guy a towel, for Christ's sake.

1051
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:55,306
- You a lawyer?
- No.

1052
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:56,348
Well, you should call one.

1053
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,100
- We're taking your auntie in.
- For what?

1054
01:13:58,183 --> 01:14:00,394
Manager caught him and the other guy.

1055
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:06,734
Well, can we get the cuffs off him,

1056
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:09,069
let him put his pants on,
we talk about this?

1057
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:10,696
Sure, we could.

1058
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,239
But we ain't.

1059
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:16,243
Okay, look,
we're out of here tomorrow morning.

1060
01:14:16,327 --> 01:14:17,453
You'll never see us again.

1061
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:19,747
There's gotta be something we can do
to work this out.

1062
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:24,627
What if you let him go
and I give you something to thank you?

1063
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:27,546
You bribing us?

1064
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:29,506
No. Hell, no.

1065
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:31,800
A gift. A thank-you.

1066
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,094
What kind of thank-you?

1067
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:36,347
Like a...

1068
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:38,349
You know, donation to the police force.

1069
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:39,516
Youse guys.

1070
01:14:40,517 --> 01:14:41,435
Whatever you want.

1071
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:44,146
You like suits?

1072
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:46,815
I was walking through
your nice town today,

1073
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:49,151
and I seen a store that was selling suits.

1074
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:51,570
Primo suits.

1075
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:54,823
What if, as a thank-you... a donation...

1076
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:57,034
I buy youse each a suit?

1077
01:14:58,786 --> 01:15:01,830
You get all dressed up,
you take the wife out for dinner.

1078
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:05,501
I mean, guys like you, you work hard.
You deserve it.

1079
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:16,261
They were wrong for the way
they treated me, and you rewarded them.

1080
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:21,141
I was hired to get you
from one show to the next.

1081
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:23,102
How I do it shouldn't matter to you.

1082
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:24,770
I just wish you hadn't paid 'em off.

1083
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:26,188
I did what I had to do.

1084
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:29,692
You know, if this got out,
it would kill your career.

1085
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:30,859
Okay, Tony.

1086
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:34,029
I need you to stop it
with the phony altruism

1087
01:15:34,113 --> 01:15:35,447
and concern for my career.

1088
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:37,032
What the hell does that mean?

1089
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:38,992
You were only thinking
about yourself back there

1090
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:41,829
because you know if I miss a show,
it'll come out of your pocketbook.

1091
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:45,040
Of course I don't want you to miss a show,
you ungrateful bastard.

1092
01:15:45,124 --> 01:15:46,875
You think I'm doing this for my health?

1093
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:49,336
Tonight, I saved your ass.

1094
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:51,588
So show a little appreciation maybe.

1095
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:54,508
Besides, I told you
never to go nowhere without me!

1096
01:15:56,427 --> 01:15:59,096
I assumed you'd want this
to be the exception.

1097
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:38,510
Want me to get some makeup or something
for the show tomorrow?

1098
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:39,970
No, I'm fine.

1099
01:16:40,053 --> 01:16:42,222
You sure? Bruise kind of shows.

1100
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:43,599
I said I'm fine.

1101
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:46,018
Okay.

1102
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:55,444
He didn't ask me to do that.

1103
01:16:55,527 --> 01:16:57,362
I'm telling you,
that's what he told me.

1104
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:58,614
He didn't ask me.

1105
01:16:58,697 --> 01:17:01,325
Tony Lip.

1106
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:04,661
Dominic, Mags.
What the hell you guys doing down here?

1107
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:05,829
Hey, Brooklyn sent us down.

1108
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:08,207
- Take care of a few things.
- Yeah.

1109
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:44,368
I'm working here.

1110
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,337
Sorry, Doc.
They're some friends from New York.

1111
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:58,507
Hey, can you get Dr. Shirley's luggage?

1112
01:17:58,590 --> 01:17:59,508
All right.

1113
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,877
Called his room. Be down in a minute.

1114
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:46,555
- Hey, Doc.
- Where are you off to?

1115
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:52,352
I'm just going downstairs.
To have a drink.

1116
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:04,698
Tony.

1117
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:07,409
I think you're doing a wonderful job.

1118
01:19:09,036 --> 01:19:09,912
So...

1119
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:14,416
I'd like to formally offer you
the position of my road manager.

1120
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:18,754
With the title also comes
more responsibility, but...

1121
01:19:20,213 --> 01:19:21,757
that also means a raise in pay.

1122
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:24,426
No. No.

1123
01:19:24,509 --> 01:19:25,594
No, thanks.

1124
01:19:27,971 --> 01:19:32,059
We agreed on 125 a week, plus expenses.

1125
01:19:32,142 --> 01:19:34,102
That's our deal, right?

1126
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:38,398
I ain't going nowhere, Doc.

1127
01:19:38,482 --> 01:19:40,108
I was just going down to tell them.

1128
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:51,912
Tony.

1129
01:19:57,334 --> 01:19:59,127
I'm sorry about last night.

1130
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:04,341
Don't worry about it.

1131
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:09,888
I've been working nightclubs
in New York City my whole life.

1132
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:11,431
I know it's a...

1133
01:20:12,683 --> 01:20:14,309
complicated world.

1134
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:29,241
So, where'd you learn
how to play like that?

1135
01:20:29,324 --> 01:20:30,283
My mother.

1136
01:20:30,742 --> 01:20:32,661
Your mother? Really?

1137
01:20:35,122 --> 01:20:37,290
She taught me how to play
on an old spinet.

1138
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:43,338
Soon as I could walk,
we'd travel around the Florida Panhandle,

1139
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:46,591
put on my little shows
in parishes and halls.

1140
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:49,094
Fortunately, a man who had seen me play

1141
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:52,764
arranged for me to study
at the Leningrad Conservatory of Music.

1142
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:55,392
I was the first Negro ever accepted there.

1143
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:58,353
That's where they taught you
all them songs you play?

1144
01:20:58,437 --> 01:21:00,605
Actually,
I was trained to play classical music.

1145
01:21:01,314 --> 01:21:05,444
Brahms, Franz Liszt, Beethoven, Chopin.

1146
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:08,196
It's all I ever wanted to play.

1147
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:12,117
But I was persuaded by my record company

1148
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,911
to pursue a career
in popular music instead.

1149
01:21:15,912 --> 01:21:18,790
They insisted that audiences
would never accept a Negro pianist

1150
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:20,292
on a classical stage.

1151
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:23,879
Wanted to turn me
into just another colored entertainer.

1152
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:28,884
You know,
the guy who's smoking while he's playing

1153
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:31,428
and sets a glass of whiskey on his piano

1154
01:21:31,511 --> 01:21:35,724
and then complains because
he's not respected like Arthur Rubinstein.

1155
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:41,063
You don't see Arthur Rubinstein
putting a glass of whiskey on his piano.

1156
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:46,485
I don't know. Personally,
I think if you stuck to the classic stuff,

1157
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:48,070
it would've been a big mistake.

1158
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:52,365
A mistake? Performing the music
I trained my entire life to play?

1159
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:55,077
Trained? What are you, a seal?

1160
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,079
People love what you do.

1161
01:21:57,162 --> 01:22:00,499
Anyone could sound like Beethoven
or "Joe Pan"

1162
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:02,125
or them other guys you said.

1163
01:22:02,209 --> 01:22:05,670
But your music, what you do...

1164
01:22:08,215 --> 01:22:09,424
only you can do that.

1165
01:22:12,677 --> 01:22:13,845
Thank you, Tony.

1166
01:22:18,892 --> 01:22:20,685
But not everyone can play Chopin.

1167
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:24,022
Not like I can.

1168
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:30,946
The trees have shed
their leafy clothing,

1169
01:22:31,404 --> 01:22:33,824
and their colors have faded
to grays and browns.

1170
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:38,203
"I saw millions of trees
all dusted with snow,

1171
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:39,996
just like out of a fairy tale."

1172
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,998
He's so expressive.

1173
01:22:42,999 --> 01:22:46,670
Got to admit, Lip's letters,
they're not bad.

1174
01:22:46,753 --> 01:22:48,004
Well, it's in the family.

1175
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:50,715
They say our great-great-great-grandfather

1176
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:53,051
helped da Vinci with the Sixteen Chapel.

1177
01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:55,554
- You mean Michelangelo.
- Right.

1178
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:57,889
What does Michelangelo have to do
with writing letters?

1179
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:00,559
I'm just saying, we're an arty family.

1180
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:05,063
"I will count the hours,
minutes, and seconds

1181
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:07,149
until you are in my arms.

1182
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:09,067
Love you, Tony.

1183
01:23:09,151 --> 01:23:10,652
PS. Kiss the kids."

1184
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:13,655
- John!
- Yeah?

1185
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:15,824
I want a letter.

1186
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:17,993
Yeah, soon as you make a meal.

1187
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:35,218
Eyes forward, Tony.

1188
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:01,786
Tony.

1189
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:05,749
All right, everybody.
Let's give our finest Louisiana welcome

1190
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:08,710
to Don Shirley and the Don Shirley Trio.

1191
01:24:35,528 --> 01:24:37,656
Your mother's ass.

1192
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:41,284
Can't see shit.

1193
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:49,209
What the hell's this guy doing?

1194
01:24:52,879 --> 01:24:54,631
Son of a bitch.

1195
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:09,104
License and papers.

1196
01:25:09,896 --> 01:25:11,606
Am I glad to see you!

1197
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:16,528
We had to turn off the main road,
and now we're lost.

1198
01:25:18,822 --> 01:25:20,282
Step out of the car.

1199
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:23,159
- What'd I do?
- Out of the car.

1200
01:25:35,171 --> 01:25:36,756
Why are you on this road?

1201
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:41,469
I told you.
We had to make a detour, and we got lost.

1202
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:48,143
And why are you driving him?

1203
01:25:48,893 --> 01:25:50,145
He's my boss.

1204
01:25:56,568 --> 01:26:00,030
He can't be out here at night.
This a sundown town.

1205
01:26:00,697 --> 01:26:01,781
What's that?

1206
01:26:03,491 --> 01:26:05,869
Get him out of the car and check his ID.

1207
01:26:05,952 --> 01:26:08,163
Come on. It's pouring rain.

1208
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:11,249
Sir, I can just get it right here
through the window.

1209
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:12,667
Get him out of the car.

1210
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:15,795
Come on, get out now.
Get out now. Get out.

1211
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:18,214
Got ID?

1212
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:23,011
How you say this last name?

1213
01:26:24,054 --> 01:26:25,180
Vallelonga.

1214
01:26:26,514 --> 01:26:29,309
- Yeah, what kind of name is that?
- It's Italian.

1215
01:26:30,393 --> 01:26:34,981
I see.
That's why you're driving him around.

1216
01:26:36,941 --> 01:26:38,610
You're half a nigger yourself.

1217
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,365
Hands in the air! Now! Now!

1218
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:47,702
Excuse me.

1219
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:53,666
Excuse me, sirs.

1220
01:26:56,419 --> 01:26:58,630
I understand
why my associate is being held,

1221
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:01,049
but what exactly am I being charged with?

1222
01:27:04,969 --> 01:27:06,805
You seem like reasonable men.

1223
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:08,932
Perhaps you could let me out

1224
01:27:09,015 --> 01:27:10,975
so that we could discuss
the situation further.

1225
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:13,186
Just put the apple butter away, boy.

1226
01:27:13,269 --> 01:27:15,855
You ain't going nowhere no time soon.

1227
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:19,442
You cannot hold me without cause.

1228
01:27:19,526 --> 01:27:20,735
I got cause.

1229
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:23,696
'Cause you let the sun
set on your black ass.

1230
01:27:25,532 --> 01:27:27,325
I want to speak to my lawyer.

1231
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:29,369
I want my call.

1232
01:27:29,828 --> 01:27:32,747
This is a flagrant violation of my rights.

1233
01:27:33,748 --> 01:27:34,916
You know...

1234
01:27:36,626 --> 01:27:40,422
he does have rights.

1235
01:27:45,468 --> 01:27:47,679
Give the Negro his goddamn phone call.

1236
01:27:48,638 --> 01:27:49,556
You happy?

1237
01:27:54,644 --> 01:27:56,062
You know a lawyer?

1238
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:57,689
Call him.

1239
01:28:09,242 --> 01:28:12,287
I walk up to the car and I say,
"Sir, you know how fast you were goin'?"

1240
01:28:12,745 --> 01:28:15,290
He says, "I'm sorry, Officer.
I didn't mean to speed, but"...

1241
01:28:15,373 --> 01:28:18,334
As my mother always said,
"What kind of brand-new fool are you?"

1242
01:28:19,252 --> 01:28:20,503
Look at them over there.

1243
01:28:21,754 --> 01:28:23,298
Take a good look at the officer you hit.

1244
01:28:23,631 --> 01:28:26,134
Look at him.
He's over there having a grand old time,

1245
01:28:26,217 --> 01:28:30,388
chatting up with his pals,
enjoying a nice cup of coffee.

1246
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:32,390
And where are you?

1247
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:35,435
In here, with me, who did nothing.

1248
01:28:36,478 --> 01:28:38,229
Yet I'm the one who pays the price.

1249
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:40,648
I'm the one who's gonna miss
the Birmingham show.

1250
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:44,152
Hey, I'm gonna lose a lot of money, too,
if you don't play Birmingham.

1251
01:28:44,235 --> 01:28:47,405
So, that little temper tantrum,
was it worth it?

1252
01:28:51,034 --> 01:28:52,410
You never win with violence, Tony.

1253
01:28:52,494 --> 01:28:55,079
You only win
when you maintain your dignity.

1254
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:57,957
Dignity always prevails.

1255
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:01,836
And tonight, because of you, we did not.

1256
01:29:07,509 --> 01:29:09,427
I wouldn't touch that mattress, Doc.

1257
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:11,804
Maryville Police.

1258
01:29:15,099 --> 01:29:16,100
No, sir.

1259
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:18,645
No, no, I... I'm not, sir.

1260
01:29:19,687 --> 01:29:21,523
Yes, sir. He's right here, sir. Yes, sir.

1261
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:23,024
Yes, sir.

1262
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:25,026
Gimme.

1263
01:29:25,693 --> 01:29:26,861
Chief Pratt. Who's this?

1264
01:29:27,529 --> 01:29:28,530
Baloney.

1265
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:34,744
Yes, sir. I can hear it now, Governor.

1266
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:40,458
No, sir. I'm sorry.

1267
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:43,044
No, of course I can recognize your voice.
It's...

1268
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:47,257
Sir?

1269
01:29:48,591 --> 01:29:51,594
You're saying the boy
we got locked up called who?

1270
01:29:55,014 --> 01:29:57,058
And he called you.

1271
01:29:57,559 --> 01:29:58,726
No... No, sir.

1272
01:29:59,352 --> 01:30:01,771
An officer was assaulted
in the line of duty.

1273
01:30:04,816 --> 01:30:05,692
No, sir. No.

1274
01:30:05,775 --> 01:30:09,153
I don't want no National Guard
coming down here neither, sir.

1275
01:30:10,572 --> 01:30:12,282
I'll get to it immediately, Governor.

1276
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:15,243
Good night to you and the missus.

1277
01:30:20,123 --> 01:30:21,541
- Get 'em out.
- What?

1278
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:23,334
Cut 'em goddamn loose.

1279
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:25,003
That dago wop hit me!

1280
01:30:25,545 --> 01:30:27,297
You want to keep your goddamn job?

1281
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:31,217
Then you do what I goddamn tell you to do
when I goddamn tell you to do it!

1282
01:30:31,301 --> 01:30:33,595
And I'm telling you
to get 'em the goddamn out!

1283
01:30:34,304 --> 01:30:35,471
Who the hell did you call?

1284
01:30:38,808 --> 01:30:41,144
Bobby Kennedy just saved our asses.

1285
01:30:41,227 --> 01:30:43,479
Marone. How great is that?

1286
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:45,607
It's not great.

1287
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:47,400
It's not great at all.

1288
01:30:47,483 --> 01:30:49,819
- It's humiliating.
- The hell you talking about?

1289
01:30:49,902 --> 01:30:51,821
We were screwed. Now we ain't.

1290
01:30:52,739 --> 01:30:55,116
And I just put the attorney general
of the United States

1291
01:30:55,199 --> 01:30:56,576
in an incredibly awkward position.

1292
01:30:56,659 --> 01:30:59,287
So what?
That's what the guy gets paid for.

1293
01:30:59,370 --> 01:31:00,622
What else he got to do?

1294
01:31:01,164 --> 01:31:04,667
That man and his brother
are trying to change this country.

1295
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:06,294
That's what else he got to do.

1296
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:09,714
Now he thinks I'm some kind of...

1297
01:31:11,591 --> 01:31:14,552
Calling from some... backwoods swamp jail,

1298
01:31:14,636 --> 01:31:16,304
asking to attenuate assault charges?

1299
01:31:16,387 --> 01:31:17,764
Who does that?

1300
01:31:17,847 --> 01:31:21,392
Garbage. That's who.
You shouldn't have hit him.

1301
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:22,894
I didn't like the way he was treating you,

1302
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:24,854
making you stand
out in the rain like that.

1303
01:31:24,937 --> 01:31:27,857
Please, you hit him
because of what he called you.

1304
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:30,735
I've had to endure that kind of talk
my entire life.

1305
01:31:30,818 --> 01:31:32,737
You should be able to take it
for at least one night.

1306
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:35,490
What? I can't get mad at that stuff
he was saying 'cause I ain't black?

1307
01:31:35,573 --> 01:31:37,033
Christ, I'm blacker than you are.

1308
01:31:37,116 --> 01:31:38,034
Excuse me?

1309
01:31:38,117 --> 01:31:40,411
You don't know shit
about your own people...

1310
01:31:40,495 --> 01:31:43,581
what they eat, how they talk,
how they live.

1311
01:31:43,665 --> 01:31:44,957
You don't even know who Little Richard is.

1312
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:48,002
So, knowing who Little Richard is
makes you blacker than me?

1313
01:31:48,795 --> 01:31:51,089
Tony,
I wish you could hear yourself sometimes.

1314
01:31:51,172 --> 01:31:52,882
You wouldn't talk so damn much.

1315
01:31:52,965 --> 01:31:56,427
Bullshit. I know exactly who I am.

1316
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:59,305
I'm the guy who lived in the same
neighborhood in the Bronx my entire life

1317
01:31:59,389 --> 01:32:02,433
with my mother, my father, my brother,
and now my wife and kids.

1318
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:04,519
That's it. That's who I am.

1319
01:32:04,602 --> 01:32:07,063
I'm the asshole who has to hustle
every goddamn day

1320
01:32:07,146 --> 01:32:08,481
to put food on the table.

1321
01:32:08,564 --> 01:32:11,609
You, Mr. Big Shot,
you live on top of a castle,

1322
01:32:11,693 --> 01:32:14,404
traveling around the world
doing concerts for rich people.

1323
01:32:14,487 --> 01:32:17,073
I live on the streets.
You sit on a throne.

1324
01:32:17,156 --> 01:32:19,867
So, yeah,
my world is way more blacker than yours.

1325
01:32:21,869 --> 01:32:24,122
- Pull over.
- What?

1326
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:26,749
- Pull over.
- I ain't pulling over.

1327
01:32:26,833 --> 01:32:28,042
Stop the car, Tony!

1328
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:31,796
What?

1329
01:32:31,879 --> 01:32:33,214
What are you doing?

1330
01:32:34,424 --> 01:32:35,383
Doc.

1331
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:39,595
Doc, what the hell are you doing?

1332
01:32:40,263 --> 01:32:42,473
Doc. Get back in the car.

1333
01:32:43,182 --> 01:32:45,560
Yes, I live in a castle, Tony! Alone!

1334
01:32:47,854 --> 01:32:49,856
And rich white people pay me
to play piano for them

1335
01:32:49,939 --> 01:32:51,315
because it makes them feel cultured.

1336
01:32:51,733 --> 01:32:53,192
But as soon as I step off that stage,

1337
01:32:53,276 --> 01:32:55,570
I go right back to being
just another nigger to them.

1338
01:32:56,946 --> 01:32:58,573
Because that is their true culture.

1339
01:32:59,657 --> 01:33:02,577
And I suffer that slight alone
because I'm not accepted by my own people,

1340
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:04,120
'cause I'm not like them either.

1341
01:33:05,496 --> 01:33:08,040
So if I'm not black enough
and if I'm not white enough

1342
01:33:08,124 --> 01:33:11,252
and if I'm not man enough,
then tell me, Tony, what am I?

1343
01:33:46,245 --> 01:33:47,914
I need some sleep.

1344
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:52,251
All right.

1345
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:56,756
I'll stop at the next place we see
and sneak you into my room.

1346
01:33:56,839 --> 01:33:58,341
No. No.

1347
01:33:58,424 --> 01:34:01,427
I refuse to stay in an establishment
where I'm not welcome.

1348
01:34:04,347 --> 01:34:06,140
Yeah. Okay.

1349
01:34:24,283 --> 01:34:26,077
Tony, do you have to smoke everywhere?

1350
01:34:29,163 --> 01:34:30,414
I didn't know it bothered you.

1351
01:34:30,998 --> 01:34:32,333
You should have told me.

1352
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:35,962
All you gotta do is say the word, Doc.

1353
01:34:49,183 --> 01:34:51,769
You do realize you'll be home
before that letter arrives.

1354
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:55,565
Yeah, I know.
Just thought I'd bring it with me.

1355
01:34:55,648 --> 01:34:57,024
Save on stamps.

1356
01:34:57,775 --> 01:34:58,776
All right.

1357
01:34:59,902 --> 01:35:01,779
Tony, give it here. I'll fix it.

1358
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:06,951
No offense, Doc,
but I think I got the hang of it now.

1359
01:35:14,417 --> 01:35:15,835
"Dear Dolores,

1360
01:35:16,294 --> 01:35:18,462
sometimes you remind me of a house.

1361
01:35:22,049 --> 01:35:24,218
A house with beautiful lights on it...

1362
01:35:25,303 --> 01:35:27,430
where everyone is happy inside."

1363
01:35:32,977 --> 01:35:35,563
Yes, Tony. You got it.

1364
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:37,315
Yeah?

1365
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:40,443
Thanks.

1366
01:35:43,696 --> 01:35:48,200
Hey, Doc, thanks for helping me
with the letters.

1367
01:35:48,784 --> 01:35:50,244
You're really good at writing 'em.

1368
01:35:51,203 --> 01:35:52,663
My pleasure, Tony.

1369
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:56,459
You know, when you get home,

1370
01:35:56,542 --> 01:35:59,211
maybe you should write...
write one to your brother.

1371
01:36:02,548 --> 01:36:04,842
He knows where I am
if he ever wants to reconnect.

1372
01:36:05,718 --> 01:36:07,803
I wouldn't wait.

1373
01:36:09,847 --> 01:36:11,015
You know...

1374
01:36:12,058 --> 01:36:14,936
world's full of lonely people
afraid to make the first move.

1375
01:36:22,944 --> 01:36:24,987
Yeah, I'll finish this tomorrow.

1376
01:36:36,415 --> 01:36:40,211
You know, Doc, something's been
eating at me this whole trip.

1377
01:36:44,173 --> 01:36:46,634
That Titsburgh was a major disappointment.

1378
01:36:46,717 --> 01:36:49,303
I didn't notice any difference at all.
Did you?

1379
01:36:49,971 --> 01:36:51,263
Good night, Tony.

1380
01:37:04,026 --> 01:37:06,320
- Good evening.
- Welcome, welcome. Come on in.

1381
01:37:09,991 --> 01:37:10,866
All righty.

1382
01:37:14,245 --> 01:37:16,247
Welcome, Mr. Shirley.

1383
01:37:16,330 --> 01:37:19,750
Graham Kindell. I'm the general manager.
It is a pleasure to meet you.

1384
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:21,252
Thank you, Mr. Kindell.

1385
01:37:21,335 --> 01:37:22,920
This is Mr. Tony Vallelonga.

1386
01:37:23,004 --> 01:37:24,422
- Nice to meet you, Tony.
- How you doing?

1387
01:37:24,505 --> 01:37:27,425
Let's keep the car right here
in our "guest of honor" spot.

1388
01:37:27,508 --> 01:37:29,260
Right this way, gentlemen.

1389
01:37:29,343 --> 01:37:30,886
- Nice.
- How was your drive up?

1390
01:37:30,970 --> 01:37:33,180
- It was wonderful.
- Good to hear. Good to hear.

1391
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:36,392
As you can imagine, our Christmas show
is our biggest show of the year,

1392
01:37:36,475 --> 01:37:38,853
and we are so happy to have you here,
Mr. Shirley.

1393
01:37:38,936 --> 01:37:41,939
So, if you need anything, anything at all,
you let me know.

1394
01:37:42,023 --> 01:37:44,400
- Thank you.
- Now, here we are.

1395
01:37:44,483 --> 01:37:47,194
We got about an hour before show time.
Any questions?

1396
01:37:48,696 --> 01:37:49,697
Where's the restaurant?

1397
01:37:50,072 --> 01:37:51,991
Well, you continue down the hall here,
Tony,

1398
01:37:52,074 --> 01:37:53,617
to the right and across the lobby.

1399
01:37:53,701 --> 01:37:56,120
- Good luck. Break a leg.
- Thank you.

1400
01:37:58,372 --> 01:38:01,459
Well, he said we got an hour.
You must be starving, Doc.

1401
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:03,002
Go ahead. I'll meet you there.

1402
01:38:29,904 --> 01:38:30,863
May we join you?

1403
01:38:31,947 --> 01:38:33,741
Yeah. Go ahead.

1404
01:38:39,872 --> 01:38:41,916
- Cocktail, gentlemen?
- I'm good.

1405
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:43,667
Three shots vodka.

1406
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:49,215
Last show. Cold War over. Time for truce.

1407
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:52,468
Is Dr. Shirley in his dressing room?

1408
01:38:53,094 --> 01:38:55,346
Yeah. More like half a broom closet.

1409
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:58,182
Tell you, I don't know
how he puts up with that shit.

1410
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:05,564
Six years ago, in 1956...

1411
01:39:06,565 --> 01:39:08,818
Nat King Cole was invited to perform

1412
01:39:08,901 --> 01:39:11,737
at the Municipal Auditorium
here in Birmingham.

1413
01:39:12,988 --> 01:39:17,868
Mr. Cole was the first Negro asked to play
at a white establishment in this city.

1414
01:39:17,952 --> 01:39:19,286
As soon as he started playing,

1415
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:22,456
a group of men attack him
for playing white people's music.

1416
01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:25,793
They pull him off stage...

1417
01:39:27,211 --> 01:39:28,462
and beat him badly.

1418
01:39:29,296 --> 01:39:30,548
Jesus Christ.

1419
01:39:34,635 --> 01:39:38,889
You asked me once
why Dr. Shirley does this.

1420
01:39:40,266 --> 01:39:41,392
I tell you.

1421
01:39:41,892 --> 01:39:44,145
Because genius is not enough.

1422
01:39:44,895 --> 01:39:47,690
It takes courage
to change people's hearts.

1423
01:39:55,656 --> 01:39:56,490
Thanks.

1424
01:39:57,867 --> 01:39:58,909
Thank you.

1425
01:40:00,744 --> 01:40:02,746
Nu? Na zdorov'ye.

1426
01:40:03,831 --> 01:40:04,874
Danke schön.

1427
01:40:08,169 --> 01:40:09,670
- Good evening.
- Can I help you?

1428
01:40:14,175 --> 01:40:16,302
There. Some friends of mine.

1429
01:40:16,385 --> 01:40:18,971
You-you... You can't come in here.

1430
01:40:27,521 --> 01:40:29,690
- I understand, but...
- Hey. What's going on?

1431
01:40:30,441 --> 01:40:34,195
This... gentleman says
that I'm not permitted to dine here.

1432
01:40:34,695 --> 01:40:36,780
No, you don't understand.
He's playing tonight.

1433
01:40:36,864 --> 01:40:37,907
He's the main event. Come on.

1434
01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:41,285
I'm sorry,
but it is the policy of the restaurant.

1435
01:40:41,368 --> 01:40:42,453
Everything all right?

1436
01:40:42,536 --> 01:40:43,871
No, it's not all right.

1437
01:40:44,330 --> 01:40:46,874
This guy's saying
Dr. Shirley can't eat here.

1438
01:40:46,957 --> 01:40:49,126
Well, I apologize, but...

1439
01:40:49,543 --> 01:40:52,129
These are long-standing traditions,
club rules.

1440
01:40:52,213 --> 01:40:53,339
I'm sure you understand.

1441
01:40:53,714 --> 01:40:55,299
No, I do not understand.

1442
01:40:55,674 --> 01:40:59,261
In 45 minutes, I will be right up there
on that stage entertaining your guests,

1443
01:40:59,345 --> 01:41:00,471
yet I can't eat here?

1444
01:41:00,554 --> 01:41:02,556
I... I'm sorry.

1445
01:41:03,057 --> 01:41:05,935
Wait a minute.
Are you telling me the bozos in his band

1446
01:41:06,018 --> 01:41:08,145
and all these people
who came here to see him play,

1447
01:41:08,229 --> 01:41:09,355
they can eat here,

1448
01:41:09,772 --> 01:41:13,025
but the star of the show,
the parking spot of honor, he can't?

1449
01:41:14,026 --> 01:41:15,319
I'm afraid not.

1450
01:41:15,819 --> 01:41:18,364
Well, he's gotta eat.
I mean, he's gotta have dinner.

1451
01:41:20,741 --> 01:41:22,534
Okay. I'll tell you what.

1452
01:41:22,618 --> 01:41:24,495
Why don't we bring something
to his dressing room?

1453
01:41:24,578 --> 01:41:25,913
John, show him a menu.

1454
01:41:25,996 --> 01:41:29,875
No. I'm not eating in that storage room.

1455
01:41:31,418 --> 01:41:33,587
Okay, well, if you prefer,

1456
01:41:33,671 --> 01:41:36,840
there's a very popular establishment
right down the road, the Orange Bird.

1457
01:41:36,924 --> 01:41:38,884
They'd be happy to feed you.

1458
01:41:41,303 --> 01:41:42,596
Doc, come here.

1459
01:41:44,265 --> 01:41:45,266
Just one second.

1460
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:48,727
You know what,
maybe that other place is better anyway.

1461
01:41:48,811 --> 01:41:50,604
I mean,
the dinner rolls here are like rocks.

1462
01:41:50,688 --> 01:41:53,232
You just go over and...
You go over and come back.

1463
01:41:58,237 --> 01:41:59,863
It's the last show.

1464
01:41:59,947 --> 01:42:01,115
It's the bottom of the ninth.

1465
01:42:01,198 --> 01:42:03,033
Let's just get it over with
and we can go home,

1466
01:42:03,117 --> 01:42:04,576
get away from these pricks.

1467
01:42:07,288 --> 01:42:08,539
There you go.

1468
01:42:08,622 --> 01:42:10,541
The fish is wonderful tonight.

1469
01:42:16,463 --> 01:42:17,965
Either I eat in this room...

1470
01:42:19,383 --> 01:42:21,135
or I'm not performing tonight.

1471
01:42:25,723 --> 01:42:27,474
May I have a word with you?

1472
01:42:41,405 --> 01:42:44,700
Mr. Villanueva,
you have to talk sense to Mr. Shirley.

1473
01:42:44,783 --> 01:42:47,745
Please make him understand.
We're not insulting him personally.

1474
01:42:47,828 --> 01:42:49,663
This is just the way
things are done down here.

1475
01:42:49,747 --> 01:42:51,707
Yeah, well, he's not from down here.

1476
01:42:51,790 --> 01:42:54,084
Yeah, just... just ask him
to be reasonable.

1477
01:42:54,168 --> 01:42:56,587
I've got 400 guests in there
expecting to be entertained tonight.

1478
01:42:56,670 --> 01:42:58,756
And Dr. Shirley expects to eat tonight.

1479
01:42:59,173 --> 01:43:01,633
Why can't you just make an exception
this one time?

1480
01:43:03,218 --> 01:43:04,303
Let me tell you a story.

1481
01:43:05,846 --> 01:43:09,016
You ever hear of the Boston Celtics
basketball club?

1482
01:43:09,099 --> 01:43:09,933
Yeah.

1483
01:43:10,017 --> 01:43:13,729
Well, those boys came through here
couple years ago on a barnstorming tour.

1484
01:43:13,812 --> 01:43:15,856
Seeing as they was the world champions
of the league and all,

1485
01:43:15,939 --> 01:43:19,735
we were tickled to have them here,
and we rolled out the welcome wagon.

1486
01:43:19,818 --> 01:43:22,863
So, do you know what table
their big coon ate at that night?

1487
01:43:24,698 --> 01:43:25,491
No.

1488
01:43:25,532 --> 01:43:28,369
I don't, either,
but it wasn't one of ours.

1489
01:43:28,827 --> 01:43:30,412
Now, let's cut the bullshit.

1490
01:43:31,038 --> 01:43:32,373
Tell me what it's gonna take?

1491
01:43:32,790 --> 01:43:35,459
Say, a hundred dollars,
you get your boy to play?

1492
01:43:37,711 --> 01:43:39,296
You think you can buy me?

1493
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:41,423
With all due respect, sir,

1494
01:43:41,507 --> 01:43:44,176
you wouldn't be in a job like this
if you couldn't be bought.

1495
01:43:44,718 --> 01:43:46,095
- You...
- Stop.

1496
01:43:46,178 --> 01:43:47,137
Tony.

1497
01:43:49,348 --> 01:43:50,641
It's all right.

1498
01:43:52,684 --> 01:43:53,894
I'll play...

1499
01:43:55,562 --> 01:43:56,897
if you want me to.

1500
01:44:11,370 --> 01:44:13,747
All right. Let's get the fuck out of here.

1501
01:44:14,998 --> 01:44:16,750
What do you mean "Let's get out of here"?

1502
01:44:17,418 --> 01:44:19,336
Where the hell do you think you're going?

1503
01:44:19,795 --> 01:44:21,922
Don, don't do this.
Now, you signed a contract, and I...

1504
01:44:22,005 --> 01:44:24,133
I know you're the kind of man
who honors a contract.

1505
01:44:24,216 --> 01:44:26,176
Connie, Bill, everything's gonna be fine.
It's all right.

1506
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:27,594
You got a show to do, mister!

1507
01:44:27,678 --> 01:44:30,139
You turn yourself around right now,
goddamn it!

1508
01:44:30,222 --> 01:44:31,223
Right now!

1509
01:44:32,015 --> 01:44:34,143
This is why you people
don't work down here.

1510
01:44:34,226 --> 01:44:36,103
'Cause you're unreliable. You hear me?

1511
01:44:36,186 --> 01:44:39,273
I shipped that goddamn Steinway
in from Atlanta for you!

1512
01:44:46,613 --> 01:44:49,283
Tony, are you hungry?

1513
01:44:49,908 --> 01:44:52,536
Does Betty like butta... er?

1514
01:44:56,081 --> 01:44:59,293
One, two...

1515
01:45:37,164 --> 01:45:38,165
You a cop?

1516
01:45:38,916 --> 01:45:40,250
Do I look Irish?

1517
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:42,628
What you want, baby?

1518
01:45:43,003 --> 01:45:44,546
Two Cutty Sarks, neat.

1519
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:45,464
Coming up.

1520
01:45:52,596 --> 01:45:55,474
Whatever your specialty is,
we'll take it.

1521
01:45:56,683 --> 01:45:58,143
Two Orange Birds!

1522
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:12,824
I like what you did back there, Doc.

1523
01:46:13,534 --> 01:46:14,868
You stood up for yourself.

1524
01:46:17,204 --> 01:46:19,331
It's like what your friend,
the president, said.

1525
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:21,124
"Ask not...

1526
01:46:22,709 --> 01:46:24,795
your country, what you can do for it.

1527
01:46:25,629 --> 01:46:27,381
Ask what you do for yourself."

1528
01:46:29,216 --> 01:46:30,217
You know?

1529
01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:36,890
So, darling, what you do,
all dressed up like that?

1530
01:46:37,432 --> 01:46:38,809
Nothing particularly important.

1531
01:46:40,852 --> 01:46:43,438
Shouldn't judge a man by his clothes.

1532
01:46:43,522 --> 01:46:46,692
He's only the greatest piano player
in the world.

1533
01:46:46,775 --> 01:46:49,486
That right? You good?

1534
01:46:50,821 --> 01:46:53,574
Don't be shy, Doc. Tell her who you are.

1535
01:46:53,657 --> 01:46:54,908
Don't tell me nothing.

1536
01:46:55,659 --> 01:46:56,535
Show me.

1537
01:47:03,333 --> 01:47:04,251
Come on.

1538
01:48:51,483 --> 01:48:53,860
Yeah! Yeah!

1539
01:50:23,533 --> 01:50:25,035
That's how you break a key.

1540
01:50:27,871 --> 01:50:29,372
That was a good time.

1541
01:50:29,456 --> 01:50:31,416
I'd do that once a month for free.

1542
01:50:31,833 --> 01:50:33,126
You were unbelievable.

1543
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:34,127
Hey, Tony.

1544
01:50:35,128 --> 01:50:37,047
I bet if we leave right now,
we can make it.

1545
01:50:37,506 --> 01:50:38,548
Make what?

1546
01:50:38,632 --> 01:50:41,259
Christmas Eve in New York City.

1547
01:50:45,639 --> 01:50:46,681
Shit!

1548
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:00,111
Don't ever flash a wad of cash
in a bar.

1549
01:51:09,996 --> 01:51:11,498
I knew you had a gun.

1550
01:51:36,690 --> 01:51:38,275
This could get bad, Doc.

1551
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:44,197
Yes. It's a shame we don't have something
to protect us on our journey.

1552
01:51:45,073 --> 01:51:46,533
I know.

1553
01:51:47,075 --> 01:51:49,870
Why don't you put your lucky rock
up on the dash, Tony?

1554
01:51:52,247 --> 01:51:53,540
Come on, Tony.

1555
01:51:54,082 --> 01:51:55,584
We need all the help we can get.

1556
01:52:01,131 --> 01:52:03,884
Thank you. I feel safer already.

1557
01:52:06,386 --> 01:52:08,638
You're a real prick, you know that?

1558
01:52:31,953 --> 01:52:33,914
Shit!

1559
01:52:43,673 --> 01:52:45,258
Goddamn cops.

1560
01:52:56,478 --> 01:52:58,355
What are you doing out here?

1561
01:52:58,438 --> 01:53:00,106
We're trying to get to New York.

1562
01:53:02,609 --> 01:53:04,194
Is there a problem, Officer?

1563
01:53:04,277 --> 01:53:05,403
Yeah.

1564
01:53:06,321 --> 01:53:09,741
I noticed your car was tilting left.
Looks like your back tire is flat.

1565
01:53:25,715 --> 01:53:27,550
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.

1566
01:53:41,606 --> 01:53:42,899
Okay, be careful, gentlemen.

1567
01:53:43,692 --> 01:53:46,152
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1568
01:53:46,903 --> 01:53:47,988
Thanks, Officer.

1569
01:54:00,667 --> 01:54:02,669
...weather advisory warning
this Christmas Eve

1570
01:54:02,752 --> 01:54:05,797
as a major snowstorm
is hitting the Eastern Seaboard

1571
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:08,925
with the severest weather
in eastern Pennsylvania,

1572
01:54:09,009 --> 01:54:11,428
northern New Jersey,
and the five boroughs.

1573
01:54:12,012 --> 01:54:14,889
Travelers are advised to stay off
the New Jersey Turnpike.

1574
01:54:14,973 --> 01:54:17,517
All right, that's it. We're done.

1575
01:54:18,143 --> 01:54:19,853
I'm pulling us into the next motel.

1576
01:54:20,562 --> 01:54:22,313
Keep going as long as you can, Tony.

1577
01:54:22,397 --> 01:54:24,357
I can't keep my eyes open.

1578
01:54:25,025 --> 01:54:26,568
I'm getting hypnotized here.

1579
01:54:27,527 --> 01:54:29,654
Think my brain's gonna explode.

1580
01:54:32,198 --> 01:54:35,785
Hey, we gave it a shot, Doc.

1581
01:54:36,786 --> 01:54:38,038
What are you gonna do?

1582
01:54:46,921 --> 01:54:49,257
All right, the table is set,
ladies and gentlemen.

1583
01:54:49,340 --> 01:54:52,093
Don't run in the house.
Don't run in the house.

1584
01:54:55,555 --> 01:54:58,058
Mom, Frankie won't let me use it.

1585
01:54:58,141 --> 01:54:59,768
Frankie, let Nicky use it!

1586
01:54:59,851 --> 01:55:00,769
Use what?

1587
01:55:04,731 --> 01:55:06,191
Here it is.

1588
01:55:10,570 --> 01:55:12,489
Kids! Wash your hands.

1589
01:55:13,364 --> 01:55:16,367
Here we go. Alla salute. Alla salute.

1590
01:55:16,993 --> 01:55:19,287
Dee! Do you need help with the calzone?

1591
01:55:19,370 --> 01:55:21,247
- No, I'm fine. No.
- All right!

1592
01:55:21,331 --> 01:55:23,083
It's time to eat!

1593
01:55:46,231 --> 01:55:47,232
Tony.

1594
01:55:47,565 --> 01:55:48,775
Tony, wake up.

1595
01:55:52,654 --> 01:55:53,696
You all right?

1596
01:55:54,155 --> 01:55:56,241
You're home. Get inside.

1597
01:56:12,340 --> 01:56:13,174
Good night.

1598
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:17,595
Wait, wait. Come...
Come up and meet my family.

1599
01:56:20,890 --> 01:56:22,350
Merry Christmas, Tony.

1600
01:56:24,811 --> 01:56:25,687
Hey...

1601
01:56:27,647 --> 01:56:29,065
Merry Christmas.

1602
01:56:51,337 --> 01:56:52,922
Hey, hey!
You're gonna choke on the bone.

1603
01:56:53,006 --> 01:56:54,382
I'm just getting started over here.

1604
01:56:56,301 --> 01:56:58,178
- You got it? You got it.
- I got it.

1605
01:56:58,887 --> 01:57:00,889
- Dolores, do you need any help?
- No, no, honey.

1606
01:57:01,514 --> 01:57:03,933
- Not while I'm eating!
- Go ahead, smoke.

1607
01:57:06,811 --> 01:57:09,355
Look who it is! Shakespeare's home! Hey!

1608
01:57:09,689 --> 01:57:10,523
Dad!

1609
01:57:13,651 --> 01:57:14,652
Hey.

1610
01:57:15,528 --> 01:57:16,613
How are you?

1611
01:57:17,864 --> 01:57:18,990
You made it back!

1612
01:57:19,073 --> 01:57:20,408
Hey, Pop. Mwah!

1613
01:57:20,491 --> 01:57:22,368
- Merry Christmas.
- What a Christmas!

1614
01:57:22,452 --> 01:57:23,953
- Buon Natale!
- Tony, God bless.

1615
01:57:24,037 --> 01:57:25,455
- Hey.
- I'm glad you made it back.

1616
01:57:29,834 --> 01:57:31,669
Wonderful, wonderful!

1617
01:57:38,218 --> 01:57:39,719
- You hungry?
- I'm starving.

1618
01:57:39,802 --> 01:57:41,137
- Hey!
- All right. Sit down.

1619
01:57:41,763 --> 01:57:43,681
Anything left?

1620
01:57:43,765 --> 01:57:44,724
Let's go!

1621
01:57:56,986 --> 01:57:59,614
- Welcome home, Dr. Shirley.
- Thank you, Amit.

1622
01:58:00,156 --> 01:58:01,491
I turned down your bed, sir.

1623
01:58:01,574 --> 01:58:03,493
Shall I unpack your luggage now?

1624
01:58:03,576 --> 01:58:06,663
No, no. Please, go home to your family.

1625
01:58:07,747 --> 01:58:08,831
Thank you, sir.

1626
01:58:14,420 --> 01:58:15,755
Merry Christmas, sir.

1627
01:58:16,130 --> 01:58:17,298
Merry Christmas.

1628
01:59:08,474 --> 01:59:10,393
The holidays are just starting.

1629
01:59:10,476 --> 01:59:13,479
I love everything in white.

1630
01:59:13,563 --> 01:59:16,232
Always. Always with the kissing.

1631
01:59:16,316 --> 01:59:18,568
What?
You never kiss me like that at the table.

1632
01:59:18,651 --> 01:59:19,986
Why don't you ever kiss me like that?

1633
01:59:21,321 --> 01:59:24,073
All right, all right, all right.
Relax, relax.

1634
01:59:27,243 --> 01:59:29,996
So, Tony, you all right?
You seem a little quiet.

1635
01:59:31,581 --> 01:59:34,375
Yeah. Nah, I'm just tired, you know?

1636
01:59:35,668 --> 01:59:36,836
Long trip.

1637
01:59:40,798 --> 01:59:42,216
You take care of that thing?

1638
01:59:48,348 --> 01:59:49,182
Thanks.

1639
01:59:49,265 --> 01:59:50,600
Yeah, you owe me 75 bucks.

1640
01:59:51,434 --> 01:59:52,518
Seventy-five?

1641
01:59:53,144 --> 01:59:54,103
Charlie said 60.

1642
01:59:54,187 --> 01:59:56,522
I'm doing this for free?

1643
01:59:59,108 --> 02:00:00,443
Hey, Tony.

1644
02:00:00,526 --> 02:00:02,445
Tony, tell us about the trip.

1645
02:00:02,528 --> 02:00:03,696
You've been gone two months.

1646
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:05,281
Yeah, how was he, the tutsoon?

1647
02:00:05,365 --> 02:00:06,574
He get on your nerves?

1648
02:00:07,367 --> 02:00:08,534
Don't call him that.

1649
02:00:13,164 --> 02:00:14,040
All right.

1650
02:00:17,543 --> 02:00:19,837
Tony,
you should have seen the day last week

1651
02:00:19,921 --> 02:00:22,298
little Frankie climbed up onto the TV.

1652
02:00:22,382 --> 02:00:24,300
I took a picture of him. It was so cute.

1653
02:00:24,384 --> 02:00:25,968
He was so funny up there.

1654
02:00:26,052 --> 02:00:28,388
What are you, nuts, Dee?
With all the tubes back there?

1655
02:00:28,471 --> 02:00:29,972
- He could've got electrocuted.
- No.

1656
02:00:30,056 --> 02:00:31,474
- What, he break it?
- What are you talking about?

1657
02:00:31,557 --> 02:00:33,017
You're thinking of toasters.

1658
02:00:33,101 --> 02:00:35,728
You can't get electrocuted
from the TV set.

1659
02:00:35,812 --> 02:00:38,940
She's not thinking about a toaster.
She's thinking about a TV.

1660
02:00:39,023 --> 02:00:40,983
Is he taking it into the bathtub?

1661
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:46,572
You're not gonna get electrocuted.

1662
02:00:51,661 --> 02:00:52,995
Charlie.

1663
02:00:53,079 --> 02:00:55,206
Hey, Lip. Johnny invited me.

1664
02:00:55,706 --> 02:00:57,291
Well, come on in.

1665
02:00:57,375 --> 02:01:00,002
All right. You remember Marie?

1666
02:01:00,086 --> 02:01:02,630
- Hey, Marie.
- Charlie, you actually came?

1667
02:01:02,713 --> 02:01:05,007
I was kidding.

1668
02:01:05,091 --> 02:01:06,801
With the wife, too?

1669
02:01:06,884 --> 02:01:08,845
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1670
02:01:08,928 --> 02:01:10,221
- Hello! What a surprise.
- Merry Christmas.

1671
02:01:10,304 --> 02:01:11,514
Nice to see you.

1672
02:01:11,931 --> 02:01:13,182
Everybody, Charlie from the pawnshop.

1673
02:01:13,266 --> 02:01:14,684
- Hey!
- Didn't bring nothing.

1674
02:01:14,767 --> 02:01:16,310
- Christmas. Can you believe it?
- Come here, come here.

1675
02:01:16,394 --> 02:01:18,938
- Sit down.
- Sit down, sit down.

1676
02:01:24,610 --> 02:01:25,695
Doc.

1677
02:01:28,406 --> 02:01:30,283
Welcome.

1678
02:01:33,453 --> 02:01:35,788
Hey, everybody.

1679
02:01:36,372 --> 02:01:37,540
Stop it, stop it.

1680
02:01:37,623 --> 02:01:39,584
This is Dr. Donald Shirley.

1681
02:01:42,295 --> 02:01:43,379
Merry Christmas.

1682
02:01:47,467 --> 02:01:50,344
Well, come on. Make some room.
Get this man a plate!

1683
02:01:59,479 --> 02:02:01,731
- Hello.
- You must be Dolores.

1684
02:02:02,648 --> 02:02:03,733
Welcome.

1685
02:02:03,816 --> 02:02:05,818
Buon Natale.

1686
02:02:07,361 --> 02:02:09,489
Thank you
for sharing your husband with me.

1687
02:02:16,496 --> 02:02:18,998
Thank you
for helping him with the letters.
