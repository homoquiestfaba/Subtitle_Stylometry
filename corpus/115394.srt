1
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,191
<i>Agent Junod? I got a call for you.</i>
<i>It's Wilson.</i>

2
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,353
What's up Wilson?

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,632
<i>On the corner of Sunnyside and</i>
<i>10th Avenue there's a diner.</i>

4
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,872
<i>Meet me there at 7 pm.</i>
<i>I'll tell you everything I know.</i>

5
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,310
Get on the radio.
Tell him we're coming over.

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,475
Follow us.

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,879
Show me what you got.

8
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,353
He won't talk.

9
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,354
You know what?
I'm gonna use the drug.

10
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,229
No! Sullivan said no.

11
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,916
<i>You're in a graveyard, Wilson.</i>

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,468
<i>And if you don't tell us</i>
<i>what we wanna know...</i>

13
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,393
<i>you are gonna be buried here.</i>

14
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,875
<i>So tell me, who was your contact?</i>

15
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,948
<i>Who were you going</i>
<i>to meet at the diner?</i>

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,958
<i>He won't talk.</i>

17
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,116
<i>Who were you meeting</i>
<i>at the diner?</i>

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,514
What?

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,830
<i>Wilson, we can't move the drug</i>
<i>unless we know what you said.</i>

20
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,310
<i>What did you tell</i>
<i>the FBI, Wilson?</i>

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,432
<i>He's coming out of it.</i>

22
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,348
<i>- What did you tell the FBI?</i>
<i>- We've got to keep him alive.</i>

23
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,238
<i>Stop moving.</i>

24
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,873
If you talked
we can't move the drug...

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,911
and then nobody gets paid.

26
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,957
Hold him!

27
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,876
Shit!

28
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,477
That stuff really works, man!

29
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,349
- Do you want me to wait?
- No. No.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,037
I'll be fine.

31
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,674
I'm gonna do this.
I'll do this.

32
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,515
There's no other
place left, Dean.

33
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,916
- I'm gonna do it.
- Ok.

34
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,912
Eventually.

35
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,480
I'm just kidding.

36
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,677
- I love you.
- I love you back.

37
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,392
<i>All cars in the vicinity of</i>
<i>Sunnyside and 98th...</i>

38
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,636
<i>please respond to an 11-80.</i>

39
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,149
<i>That's Sunnyside and 98th, 11-80.</i>

40
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,036
I still have those dreams.

41
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,510
But it's not as I was then.

42
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,752
It's as I am now. I'm 53.

43
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,753
I'm out in the bush,
out of shape, overweight...

44
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,952
a big, fat and immobile target.

45
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,751
A lot of guys had
a lot worse than me.

46
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,277
And they're fine.
Why can't I do that?

47
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,990
Why do I have to keep coming
here to feel any better?

48
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,272
What about you, Dean?

49
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,392
It's your first time.
You wanna share?

50
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,508
Yeah. My name is Dean Cage.

51
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,469
And... I was in Bosnia.

52
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,910
Guess it's a small war compared to what
some of you guys have been through.

53
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,234
There ain't no
small war, brother.

54
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,438
No. I guess there isn't.

55
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,071
My friend, Amy...

56
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:43,039
she's actually technically
more like my... brother's...

57
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,636
Well, she's my best friend's sister.

58
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,114
You know, she and I...
it's kinda complicated.

59
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,633
Anyway, she suggested
that I come.

60
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,198
Dean, they're pouring gasoline on me.

61
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,874
Because I'm...

62
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,070
The bastards are gonna burn me!

63
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,673
- I'm kinda stuck.
- They're gonna burn me, Dean.

64
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,035
They're gonna burn me.

65
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,472
If it's alright with you guys,
since it's my first time here...

66
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,719
I'd like to just sit
this one out...

67
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,956
and listen if it's okay
with you guys.

68
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,752
Of course it is, Dean.

69
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,154
What the hell happened?

70
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,472
The trucker says a gurney
came flying out of an ambulance,

71
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,674
that John Doe over there,
riding it like a bronco.

72
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,677
The bastard took an up close
tour of each tire.

73
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,078
- Is this the ambulance?
- No, another one.

74
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,673
Where is it?

75
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,115
That's the thing.
The ambulance kept going.

76
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,350
What?

77
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,349
- Does this make sense to anybody?
- Not yet.

78
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,316
Can you make out
these letters here?

79
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,589
What is that, an "M"?

80
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,232
"N", "V"? I don't know.

81
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,996
So, you wanna tell me about it?

82
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,515
Did you fuck up?

83
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,636
Who told you to interrogate him
after the injection?

84
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,438
Lietch, would you put
your piece to his head, please?

85
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,076
Do as I ask, please.

86
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,916
You think I like this?

87
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,919
Lietch doesn't like it,
I know you don't.

88
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,509
This is where we are,
because you...

89
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,596
despite all your training,
decided on actions...

90
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,632
that went outside the mission
parameters, do you understand?

91
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,191
- Yes.
- Wilson did say something.

92
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,713
The guy he was snitching to.
Supposed to have a meeting.

93
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,518
We know when and where.
Tonight...

94
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,109
diner, 7 o'clock.

95
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,748
You can lower your weapon now.
The point has been made.

96
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,071
Of course, Wilson can't tell us
what he told the Feds.

97
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,673
But the Federal agent he's been
snitching to can.

98
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,391
Well then, why don't we stick around
and see who should up for coffee and pie?

99
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,559
How did it go?

100
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,675
It's still going on.

101
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,758
Dean, you left?

102
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,469
You know, look.
These guys...

103
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,755
they're alright,
but they're kinda cuckoo.

104
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,436
<i>I was thinking...</i>

105
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,833
maybe we can meet up
at an out place.

106
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,949
There are some things
I wanna tell you.

107
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,548
I don't wanna tell them,
I wanna tell you.

108
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,993
<i>Meet me at the diner.</i>
<i>7 o'clock, ok?</i>

109
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,759
I'll see you there, baby.

110
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,229
Alright. Bye.

111
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,435
MacNab...
Stay.

112
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,357
Peterson, I want you
out in the street

113
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,875
- Why?
- Why?

114
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,317
Because MacNab
will be doing the id...

115
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,557
and I want Lietch to drive.
You got a problem with that?

116
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,554
Good. So take up
his position.

117
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,636
Come here.

118
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,512
So what's this stuff gonna do?

119
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,279
What's it gonna do?
It's gonna make us very rich.

120
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,431
This is about all you need
to worry right now.

121
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,312
Have you used one of these?

122
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,670
- No.
- Look and learn.

123
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,835
You load it exactly like
you load a gun.

124
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,039
Lock it up.

125
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,517
Hypodermics. Eight of them.

126
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,673
You stick it in his arm, his leg.
Doesn't matter where.  Bang.

127
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,109
You clear?

128
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,752
Let's do it.

129
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,754
We id him then we wait.

130
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,440
You take him down outside,
you understand?

131
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,955
Outside when you inject him.

132
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,875
You do not talk to him.
Not a word.

133
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,279
- You got it?
- I got it.

134
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,072
Let's rock and roll.

135
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,278
- Hi.
- Hi.

136
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,073
<i>- One for dinner, please.</i>
<i>- Table 14 is open.</i>

137
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,155
<i>Thanks.</i>

138
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,879
- Coffee?
- Great.

139
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,437
Thanks.

140
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,228
A new guest to the party,
coming in.

141
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,872
Right on time.

142
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,797
<i>MacNab, hold tight.</i>

143
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,154
It's him.
He's waiting for someone.

144
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,840
Let's make sure.

145
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,036
Right. OK.

146
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,950
Brilliant.

147
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,595
Alright. Here we go.
Look good.

148
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,631
- We're trying.
- The best as you can.

149
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,278
You look beautiful.

150
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,556
Ready?
One, two, three!

151
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,153
Dean!

152
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,276
<i>Listen, MacNab, he's not</i>
<i>going anywhere. We wait.</i>

153
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,956
Sullivan, I just got made.
Big time.

154
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,237
<i>What do you mean 'made'? How can he</i>
<i>make you, you're on the street!</i>

155
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,549
He's right. He's anxious and
scoping this place out like a pro.

156
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,389
- He's just made us too.
- We're not sure.

157
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,396
Fuck!
Damn it!

158
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,312
We're gonna have
to do this ugly.

159
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,477
<i>MacNab, you're a go.</i>
<i>Compromised authority.</i>

160
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,271
- Sorry pal, that seat is taken.
- I'm afraid not.

161
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,078
Wilson can't make it,
ever again.

162
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,670
Look buddy,
you got the wrong table.

163
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,957
This don't have to be messy.
I just got a few questions for you.

164
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,839
Sorry, left handed.

165
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,118
You see?
Now it's gonna get messy.

166
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,235
Get out of the way.

167
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,437
Hello?

168
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,949
How are you doing?

169
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,435
He's a runner, Lietch.
You're out of position.

170
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,118
<i>Get in position.</i>

171
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,310
Get out of the way!

172
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,514
Back it up.
We need to extract MacNab.

173
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,315
Are you ok, man?

174
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,154
Police officer!
Let me see your hands!

175
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,873
Get your hands in the air
and get on your knees!

176
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,831
Now!

177
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,192
Hands behind your head
and get on the ground.

178
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,510
I want you kissing the
pavement now.

179
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,351
Alright, down on the ground.
Take it easy.

180
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,198
Dean!

181
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,239
<i>Move!
Come on!</i>

182
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,830
<i>What's with you, idiot?</i>

183
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,916
<i>You stupid moron!</i>

184
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,510
Sullivan, we got him.

185
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,114
Turn him over.

186
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,708
Let's go.

187
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,709
Lift.

188
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,270
Apparently, Dean assaulted
another man outside...

189
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,231
before being picked up
by an ambulance.

190
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,034
We're calling hospitals.

191
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,712
This doesn't make sense.

192
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,434
You don't use a hypogun
as a weapon.

193
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,678
Look, I like Dean too.
He's a war hero.

194
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,279
He certainly got medals
to prove it.

195
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,839
But did you see
that guy's face?

196
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,758
So what? He just snapped,
is that it? Just went nuts?

197
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,595
You say like the possibility
has never occurred to you.

198
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,669
What is this?
Who are you guys?

199
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,273
I'm one of the guys that
Washington sent you to whack.

200
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,476
But we didn't like
that idea very much.

201
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,832
Peterson, do not talk to him.

202
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,390
Your instinct's right.
You should be scared.

203
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,596
Will you shut up?

204
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,399
Where is he?

205
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,671
Where's Scott?

206
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,638
Where is he?

207
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,109
Who the hell is Scott?

208
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,196
- Where does he think he is?
- What did you say to him?

209
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,870
Who's in charge here?

210
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,437
Detective Knight.

211
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,034
- Can I help you?
- Agent Junod. FBI.

212
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,316
You had a suspect here.
Where he's been booked?

213
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,677
Slow down. This is
my crime scene, alright?

214
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,554
- My town, my suspect.
- I'm sorry, my fault.

215
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,594
You're under the impression
I'm asking.

216
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,191
We're investigating the theft
of a prohibited narcotic...

217
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,390
from a government facility.

218
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,229
Our drugs, our facility,
our suspect.

219
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,830
No, you're gonna have
to do better than that.

220
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,712
If I get the right phone call
from the right person...

221
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,354
then we can talk.

222
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,197
I want the other one too.

223
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,036
The runner.

224
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,919
He's at a hospital, and he hasn't
been charged with anything.

225
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,672
You sure he's at a hospital?

226
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,439
Witnesses saw him being
picked up by an ambulance.

227
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,949
So yes, I'm sure.

228
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,634
Amy, why are you
messing with the Bureau?

229
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,911
Because they are here.
Why is the Bureau here?

230
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,469
You should not have brought
a body here.

231
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,591
How much time do we have, doctor?

232
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,470
- When did you inject him?
- About thirty minutes ago.

233
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,471
He's pretty beat up.

234
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,873
He weights what? 180, 190?

235
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,191
I'd say synapse failure and
death in six hours.

236
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,117
Let's get him inside.

237
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,352
And then he pulled that on me.

238
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,756
I know. He was the wrong guy
to ask.

239
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,195
No, I don't know what that is.
What is that?

240
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,875
What did you do to him?
Did you inject him?

241
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,356
With what?

242
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,631
I got news for you,
you cocky little prick.

243
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,433
You fucked with the wrong guy,
because when you fucked with him...

244
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,551
you fucked with me.

245
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,588
I'm gonna get what I need from you,
if I have to cut you open to find it.

246
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,397
- Still haven't got that phone call.
- I weighed you one better.

247
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,318
in writing.

248
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,678
Alright. Every 'i' dotted,
every 't' crossed.

249
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,189
I guess he's all yours then.

250
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,756
You'll have him as soon
as he's out of processing.

251
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,555
I want him now, Detective.

252
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,029
Well, that's a whole other
set of orders.

253
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,798
If you'd gotten here
a little quicker...

254
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,672
The runner from the diner,
Dean Cage, I checked him out.

255
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,429
- The guy is a Three Charlie.
- Jesus!

256
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,908
<i>Pentagon trained spook...</i>

257
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,195
<i>Black Ops, Panama,</i>
<i>Iraq. Real bad ass.</i>

258
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,039
<i>This guy has toured the world</i>
<i>and left a wake of bodies behind.</i>

259
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,311
- So what's going on now?
- He's a civilian now.

260
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,431
Discharged right after
his last Op.

261
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,154
A little wet job in Bosnia.
Complete failure.

262
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,550
Cage is the only member
of his team that came back.

263
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,871
The guy snapped.
He's a section 8.

264
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,277
- So who is he working for?
- Who cares?

265
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,197
We know where they are.
I say we move it on the hospital.

266
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,436
And if the package ain't there?

267
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,033
No, we stick to the plan.

268
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,869
This is the man who killed
your husband and children.

269
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,273
Would you like to know
where you can find him?

270
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,719
Hold up. What are you doing
with my suspect?

271
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,229
Stand down, detective. This is
no longer your concern.

272
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,390
What do you think? You think
you can walk in here...

273
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,789
flash your badge and I'm supposed
to give you a hand job, is that it?

274
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,393
Well, fuck you!

275
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,993
And fuck Hoover too,
I wanna talk to that man.

276
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,315
You ain't talking to no one.
You're a nuisance, an annoyance,

277
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,159
you're a mutt running around,
sniffing other dogs' butts.

278
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,470
- Go away.
- You're out of your league.

279
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,073
- These guys ain't FBI.
- What?

280
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,832
- You're talking?
- What did you say?

281
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,712
You have the balls
to open your mouth?

282
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,558
I'll talk to you.
I'll tell you whatever...

283
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,996
Fuck!

284
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:31,432
It's alright.
It's just the shoulder.

285
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,192
Somebody get me an ambulance.

286
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,959
Dean, can you hear me?

287
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,152
Can you hear me?

288
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,351
Can you hear me?

289
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:06,072
We've got someone who wants
to talk to you.

290
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,032
Someone you trust.

291
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,078
Your best friend.

292
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,352
Alright, shit, it's me man.
It's me. Fuck...

293
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,715
Scott?

294
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,956
They need to know what Wilson
told you about the shipment.

295
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,198
It's not a big deal.
They just need to know...

296
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,358
Did he tell you where they
were shipping it out from?

297
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,357
I don't know what
you're talking about.

298
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,956
Did Wilson tell you where
they were picking up the XE?

299
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,756
I don't understand.

300
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,233
If you don't tell them...

301
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,511
what Wilson told you,
they're going to kill me.

302
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,793
Scott...

303
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,595
you're already dead.

304
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,229
I'm right here. You can see me,
I'm talking to you.

305
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,074
What did Wilson tell you?

306
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,994
What did he tell you
about the shipment?

307
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,358
What do you know about
the goddamn shipment, Dean?

308
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,912
Dean Cage,
United States Army...

309
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,918
1-9-0-4-0-5-2-4-3.

310
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,155
Dean Cage,
U. S. Army...

311
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:44,910
- 1-9-0-4-0-5...
- Son of a bitch.

312
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,032
What the fuck is going on here?

313
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,553
What is this?

314
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,756
We told him you're
his best friend.

315
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,276
- His best friend is dead.
- Now he thinks we killed him.

316
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,751
Hold on.
Give me a sec.

317
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,194
- How are you feeling? Does it hurt?
- Fuck you!

318
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,397
Where did you get that?

319
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,114
You don't share with us,
we don't share with you.

320
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,272
You're not FBI,
who the hell are you?

321
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:02,316
- CIA.
- Spooks working domestic.

322
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,910
Now that's illegal.

323
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,670
- We're on the same side.
- No.

324
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,713
Somebody injected this shit
into my friend.

325
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,672
I'm on his side.

326
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,552
Your friend?

327
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,757
My friend, my family.

328
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,474
You're fucking with my family.

329
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,236
What is this shit?

330
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,751
It's called XE,
as in "experimental".

331
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,518
What does it do?

332
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,951
If I inject you with this...

333
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,469
can I make you shoot
somebody at the police station?

334
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,591
Yes.

335
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,518
You can control the subject
with a simple suggestion.

336
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,395
And it's fatal.

337
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,830
Total synapse failure from
6 to 8 hours of injection.

338
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,951
Is there an antidote?

339
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,230
- We don't have it.
- Who does?

340
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,310
Alright!
Sullivan has the antigen.

341
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,113
- Who's Sullivan?
- He's former Agency.

342
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,800
He used the XE for
hostile interrogations.

343
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,871
He was impressed.

344
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,673
He decided he could make
more by selling it.

345
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,189
He went after the whole
batch and he got it.

346
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,231
Where can I find him?
Where?

347
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,238
I don't know.

348
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,032
<i>Let him go.</i>

349
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,477
What did he say?

350
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,915
Let him go.

351
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,517
Cut him down.

352
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,670
Cut him down or I'll kill
every one of you motherfuckers.

353
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,953
<i>- Cut who down, Dean?</i>
<i>- Don't say another word to him.</i>

354
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:03,396
Is he talking about his buddy?
You said his buddy was dead.

355
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,557
You have to understand
something here.

356
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,198
This is the most powerful
hallucinogen the world's ever seen.

357
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,513
His susceptibility to suggestion
is almost total...

358
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,279
but his mind will still
take him places.

359
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,753
I don't understand.

360
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,668
Something was said to him before
you brought him to me.

361
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,156
It's total reality,
but in his mind...

362
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,392
- I'm gonna kill every one of you.
- Future tense, past tense...

363
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:36,040
OK. You mentioned Scott.
Now Scott is dead.

364
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,874
- Still he says...
- Cut him down.

365
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,036
He's reliving something now.

366
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,110
This is a memory.

367
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,392
- He's reliving a memory.
- What is it a memory of?

368
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,950
Dean Cage,
U. S. Army.

369
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,909
I say he was captured, him and
this man named Scott.

370
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,152
Out in the field
they were captured.

371
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,989
Something was said to him
before you brought him to me.

372
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,316
You didn't bring me
a clean subject.

373
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,709
Peterson.

374
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,958
What exactly did you say to him
before you brought him here?

375
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,992
I told him we were the guys
Washington has sent him to whack.

376
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,680
Great. Because that has
triggered something...

377
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,756
and now he thinks we're
about to kill his friend Scott.

378
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,478
He said he's already dead.

379
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,790
Not anymore, he doesn't.
At least not in his mind.

380
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,834
Why couldn't you keep your mouth
shut like I asked you to?

381
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,197
Let me raise his heart rate
a little bit...

382
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,278
just give it a little bump. These
floors are completely sound proof.

383
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,913
Doesn't matter how loud
it gets.

384
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,676
Whatever.
Just get me what I want.

385
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,552
I'll get you what you want.

386
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,870
I don't mind doing this
the hard way.

387
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:17,232
- We got more on that ambulance.
- What?

388
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,148
He used his chrome box to change the
traffic lights all the way to Catonsville.

389
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,759
Where did it go?

390
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,440
We lost it when it got off
the beltway, but we got its id.

391
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,915
St. Nevis Hospital. It's a private
facility. Psychiatric.

392
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,508
Psychiatric?

393
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,792
- Dean...
- Cut him down.

394
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,238
Listen, I wanna
get this straight.

395
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,638
Cut him down.
Cut him down.

396
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,794
You want us to let
Scott go, is that it?

397
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,869
- Cut him down.
- We'll cut him down.

398
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,873
Cut Scott down.

399
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,596
He doesn't have to die again.

400
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,268
Just tell us what
we wanna know.

401
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,878
Is it safe to move the XE?

402
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,789
I don't know. I told you I don't
know anything about any XE.

403
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,714
Do the Feds know where
we're moving the XE?

404
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,758
Don't make me kill him.

405
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,950
I don't know what
you're talking about.

406
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,517
You don't know what I'm
talking about?

407
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,839
- Are you sure?
- Fuck it, I don't know.

408
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,274
You don't know?

409
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,035
OK. Have it your way.

410
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,193
Kill him. Kill him.
Go kill Scott.

411
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,029
Rip his fucking throat out. We're
gonna make this prick watch.

412
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,753
Mr. Sullivan?

413
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,599
I'm sorry to disturb you,
but we got a situation down here.

414
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,233
Mr. Sullivan?

415
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,630
We got a couple of cops
wanting to get in.

416
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,995
<i>Wanna tell me what I should do?</i>
<i>Are you coming down or what?</i>

417
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,597
Give me a couple of minutes.

418
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,996
I'm gonna have to let them in.

419
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,757
Here we go.

420
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,511
Detective Knight.
My partner, Detective Miller.

421
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,749
My supervisor will be
right down.

422
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,714
We didn't ask
to see a supervisor.

423
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,509
Make it hurt.

424
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,076
Fuck you.

425
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,029
This is all your fault.

426
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,790
Kill him.
Kill Scott.

427
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,272
You fucked up.

428
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,589
Sullivan...

429
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,993
we have a problem.

430
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,993
Whatever it is,
it can wait.

431
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,634
Open it.

432
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,109
Hi, I'm the hospital administrator.
How can I help you?

433
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,835
Clear.

434
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,754
Clear.

435
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,755
Are you quite sure it was
one of our vehicles, right?

436
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,517
That's a little strange.

437
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,551
I didn't hear anything
about accidents tonight.

438
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,114
Would they concern you
with such information?

439
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,078
Absolutely.
I'm very hands on here.

440
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,797
Can we see that ambulance?

441
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,873
- Sure, if you think it's important.
- I do.

442
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,278
Shit! Did I do that?

443
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,714
I don't see any signs
of any accidents.

444
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,194
Where's the other ambulance?

445
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,557
The other one? It's been on
the shop for over a week now.

446
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,198
I've got a better idea.

447
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,998
The whole place is on fire.

448
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,473
<i>The whole place is on fire.</i>

449
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,198
The drug. The drug.
Right.

450
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,913
Alright. Let's try this.

451
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,638
You're on fire.

452
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,956
<i>You're on fire.</i>

453
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,273
<i>We'll put that fire</i>
<i>out for you.</i>

454
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,717
There's lots of water down here.
Come on down.

455
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,192
We'll put it out for you.

456
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,789
What the fuck...

457
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,751
Goddamn it!

458
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,795
You're free!

459
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,879
You're free!

460
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,077
What the hell is he doing?

461
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,548
He thinks the whole place
is on fire.

462
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,594
There's one in there.

463
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,557
He's saving the patients.

464
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,758
Have you seen my pony?
He's white.

465
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,235
If anything comes to mind,
anything at all.

466
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,796
- Sure.
- Thanks for your time.

467
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,514
<i>Put your hands over your head</i>
<i>and surrender your weapon.</i>

468
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,312
<i>You won't be harmed.</i>

469
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,189
<i>Place your weapon on the ground</i>
<i>and put your hands over your head.</i>

470
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,716
<i>Put your weapon on the ground</i>
<i>and your hands over your head.</i>

471
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,677
Amy?

472
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,989
Don't fire.
Do not fire.

473
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,750
Don't fire! Officer
needs assistance.

474
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,950
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
