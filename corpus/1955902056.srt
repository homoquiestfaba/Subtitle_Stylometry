1
00:00:05,613 --> 00:00:08,196
(uneasy music)

2
00:02:09,747 --> 00:02:12,247
- I was born with seven clits.

3
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:14,878
Well, seven that I know of.

4
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:16,552
Seven that I can feel and touch.

5
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:17,846
Seven separate clitorises,

6
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,543
each one constantly craving attention.

7
00:02:20,543 --> 00:02:22,251
Actually, I'm pretty sure
there are more than seven,

8
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:24,049
but the others are buried so deep inside

9
00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:26,331
that only a doctor could find them.

10
00:02:26,331 --> 00:02:27,617
And I'm sick of doctors.

11
00:02:27,617 --> 00:02:29,251
Doctors probing, doctors touching,

12
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:31,582
doctors, doctors, doctors.

13
00:02:31,582 --> 00:02:33,982
To some, I was a perfect example

14
00:02:33,982 --> 00:02:36,449
of permanent sexual arousal syndrome,

15
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:40,565
but to most I was simply the
girl with the crazy pussy.

16
00:02:40,565 --> 00:02:41,410
Look at 'em.

17
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,400
Oblivious, completely unaware that

18
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,032
a genuine freak of nature sits among them.

19
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:47,352
And that's what I am, alright.

20
00:02:47,352 --> 00:02:50,062
A mutant, a grotesque abomination,

21
00:02:50,062 --> 00:02:52,217
a lovely little monstrosity.

22
00:02:52,217 --> 00:02:53,297
Wait, wait.

23
00:02:53,297 --> 00:02:55,965
Look at that bad boy swagger.

24
00:02:55,965 --> 00:02:57,709
What you think, auto theft?

25
00:02:57,709 --> 00:02:58,667
Sure.

26
00:02:58,667 --> 00:02:59,734
Drug possession?

27
00:02:59,734 --> 00:03:01,011
Uh-huh.

28
00:03:01,011 --> 00:03:06,011
Assault, rape, murder, ah,
that's where it gets interesting.

29
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:08,749
Got 'im.

30
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:12,073
Yeah, well it's not his IQ I'm after.

31
00:03:12,073 --> 00:03:14,683
He's just meat to feed the hungry beast.

32
00:03:14,683 --> 00:03:16,148
A beast so unique that I'm convinced

33
00:03:16,148 --> 00:03:19,522
I'm my own species, a new species.

34
00:03:19,522 --> 00:03:21,366
The doctors think I'm a genetic mistake,

35
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:23,881
but I believe I'm an
evolutionary leap forward.

36
00:03:23,881 --> 00:03:26,159
A female of the future
who feeds on orgasms

37
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,458
the way you people
devour burgers and fries.

38
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:32,288
By the way, I'm more
than just a normal girl,

39
00:03:32,288 --> 00:03:34,780
and sometimes, most times,

40
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,008
I wish I could find more
than just a normal guy.

41
00:03:39,008 --> 00:03:41,758
(dramatic music)

42
00:04:32,624 --> 00:04:34,957
(screaming)

43
00:04:47,762 --> 00:04:50,262
(eerie music)

44
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,593
- You need that pussy eaten?

45
00:05:17,837 --> 00:05:19,692
- Tell me about these.

46
00:05:19,692 --> 00:05:21,535
- See no evil, hear no
evil, speak no evil?

47
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,988
Sully gave me that for witnessing him

48
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:24,652
kill somebody and not sayin' nothin'.

49
00:05:24,652 --> 00:05:27,997
And this, that's the demon
bitch that stole my heart.

50
00:05:27,997 --> 00:05:28,830
You like that one?

51
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,663
- [Jennifer] Yeah.

52
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:30,871
- Fuck the world?

53
00:05:30,871 --> 00:05:33,371
That's how I'm gonna fuck you.

54
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,202
(heavy breathing)

55
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:14,036
(hand slapping)

56
00:06:25,154 --> 00:06:26,904
- No, come inside me.

57
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:31,934
- Why you dirty little cunt bitch whore.

58
00:06:35,704 --> 00:06:37,871
(moaning)

59
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:48,503
(bodies thumping)

60
00:06:48,503 --> 00:06:50,670
(moaning)

61
00:07:04,814 --> 00:07:07,236
I'm gonna come, I'm gonna come.

62
00:07:07,236 --> 00:07:09,632
(moaning)

63
00:07:09,632 --> 00:07:12,299
(head thumping)

64
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,647
(moaning)

65
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,743
- Oops.

66
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,183
(moaning faintly)

67
00:08:25,532 --> 00:08:27,699
(moaning)

68
00:08:33,724 --> 00:08:35,891
(moaning)

69
00:08:40,883 --> 00:08:43,133
(grunting)

70
00:08:44,848 --> 00:08:47,348
(baby crying)

71
00:09:02,095 --> 00:09:05,262
(baby crying faintly)

72
00:09:11,908 --> 00:09:15,094
No, no, don't go there, just ignore it.

73
00:09:15,094 --> 00:09:16,855
It's not what you think,
it's not a real baby.

74
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:18,189
Real babies take nine months to grow,

75
00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:19,690
mine take less than two hours,

76
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,593
which means my babies aren't real babies.

77
00:09:21,593 --> 00:09:24,499
My babies are fake
unfinished freak babies.

78
00:09:24,499 --> 00:09:27,111
So just mind your own damn
business and ignore it!

79
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:29,611
(baby crying)

80
00:09:39,506 --> 00:09:40,855
Usually, I try not to kill 'em,

81
00:09:40,855 --> 00:09:43,086
but yeah, it happens now and then.

82
00:09:43,086 --> 00:09:44,712
Sometimes things get too rough,

83
00:09:44,712 --> 00:09:45,847
sometimes it's self defense,

84
00:09:45,847 --> 00:09:49,179
and sometimes, sometimes I
just go nuts, and why not?

85
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:50,329
I'm not looking for romance.

86
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:51,491
I just wanna good fuck,

87
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,079
then get out of my face and disappear.

88
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:55,009
No names, no cuddling, just bounce.

89
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:56,597
Especially when I'm knocked up,

90
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:59,348
which is also happening
a little too much lately.

91
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,877
Then I just wanna find
someplace private real fast,

92
00:10:01,877 --> 00:10:05,484
deliver my little freak
baby, and dump it somewhere.

93
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:06,317
(camera clicking)

94
00:10:06,317 --> 00:10:09,037
Oh yeah, yeah, you're
hot, you're really hot.

95
00:10:09,037 --> 00:10:12,821
Come on, big daddy, show me what you got.

96
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:16,488
Yeah, you sexy bitch,
look like you want it.

97
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:20,834
How much do you charge, you cheap slut?

98
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:25,033
Yeah, yeah, you big hunk of man!

99
00:10:26,407 --> 00:10:27,657
Lick them lips!

100
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:30,440
Get 'em all wet.

101
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,690
Tell me where they've been.

102
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,571
Ooh, I love that ass!

103
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:39,154
Come on, baby, shake it for me.

104
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:43,412
Let me see what's under your hood!

105
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:48,374
I don't know, something's missing.

106
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:51,172
Give me the Maya with the 180 on it,

107
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:53,505
I wanna experiment a little.

108
00:11:03,432 --> 00:11:06,182
(sinister music)

109
00:11:12,942 --> 00:11:15,393
I love a man in uniform!

110
00:11:15,393 --> 00:11:17,512
- Get the fuck outta
my lot, you dizzy twat!

111
00:11:17,512 --> 00:11:18,711
What the fuck is wrong with you?

112
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,411
You got no fucking respect.

113
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:23,316
Show no respect, you some kind
of commie bitch or somethin'?

114
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,713
The morals are gone
because of people like you.

115
00:11:25,713 --> 00:11:28,406
Our country, we fight a
war for hoes like you?

116
00:11:28,406 --> 00:11:30,085
It's disrespect for the country,

117
00:11:30,085 --> 00:11:31,786
disrespect for every fucking thing.

118
00:11:31,786 --> 00:11:32,830
Cause you show no values.

119
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,590
Values the fucking toilet.

120
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,132
Get the fuck outta here!

121
00:11:36,132 --> 00:11:37,503
(camera clicking)

122
00:11:37,503 --> 00:11:39,478
- Perfect, you can kill me now.

123
00:11:39,478 --> 00:11:40,645
That's a wrap!

124
00:11:43,481 --> 00:11:44,844
- You know, you came this close,

125
00:11:44,844 --> 00:11:49,094
this fucking close to
meetin' the king of Nazareth.

126
00:11:50,594 --> 00:11:53,094
(eerie music)

127
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,560
- [Jennifer] Like it?

128
00:12:06,462 --> 00:12:08,301
- I don't know.

129
00:12:08,301 --> 00:12:09,765
- I got a whole album full.

130
00:12:09,765 --> 00:12:11,598
Go ahead, take a look.

131
00:12:13,507 --> 00:12:15,639
- Hey Jen, I got this great location

132
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:16,956
for the Mass Appeal shoot.

133
00:12:16,956 --> 00:12:19,158
It's this old 22 room mansion in Brooklyn.

134
00:12:19,158 --> 00:12:20,297
It's sick!

135
00:12:20,297 --> 00:12:21,988
Fatherman Preacher Divine used to own it.

136
00:12:21,988 --> 00:12:23,309
You want me to make it happen?

137
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,142
- It sounds good.

138
00:12:24,142 --> 00:12:25,124
- Alright.

139
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:27,624
(eerie music)

140
00:12:37,645 --> 00:12:39,393
- Holy shit.

141
00:12:39,393 --> 00:12:42,174
I've never seen anything
like these before.

142
00:12:42,174 --> 00:12:44,366
- It's my secret collection
of erotic photos.

143
00:12:44,366 --> 00:12:45,918
Sexy, yes?

144
00:12:45,918 --> 00:12:47,632
- These are more like scary.

145
00:12:47,632 --> 00:12:49,625
- It's a catalog of lovers,

146
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,798
each of 'em caught in
the throws of passion.

147
00:12:51,798 --> 00:12:54,534
Caught in their most intimate moments.

148
00:12:54,534 --> 00:12:56,201
I call it fuck face.

149
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:01,963
- These are, are really disturbing.

150
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:04,345
I mean I can't tell if they're having

151
00:13:04,345 --> 00:13:06,422
the greatest orgasm of their life

152
00:13:06,422 --> 00:13:09,376
or if they're being killed.

153
00:13:09,376 --> 00:13:11,156
- What's the difference?

154
00:13:11,156 --> 00:13:12,530
- I'm just surprised.

155
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,464
I mean, don't take this
the wrong way or anything,

156
00:13:14,464 --> 00:13:17,946
but I always took you for a lesbo.

157
00:13:17,946 --> 00:13:21,602
Or one of those asexual
never get laid types.

158
00:13:21,602 --> 00:13:24,386
I mean, I've never even
heard you talk about boys.

159
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,498
- There's nothing to talk about.

160
00:13:25,498 --> 00:13:27,351
They're just anonymous
strangers I meet at night

161
00:13:27,351 --> 00:13:30,768
in the bars, in the clubs, in the gutter.

162
00:13:35,252 --> 00:13:37,053
I started menstruating when I was five,

163
00:13:37,053 --> 00:13:39,310
and my periods have never been normal.

164
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,377
I bleed too much, and a five year old girl

165
00:13:41,377 --> 00:13:42,599
with blood streaming down her legs

166
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:45,404
really freaked out my parents.

167
00:13:45,404 --> 00:13:48,142
My eighth birthday coincided
with a particularly bad period

168
00:13:48,142 --> 00:13:51,613
and I lost 1/5 of all the
blood in my body that day.

169
00:13:51,613 --> 00:13:53,566
My horrified parents
hospitalized me which is

170
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:56,035
when we all learned
just how different I am.

171
00:13:56,035 --> 00:14:00,313
(heavy breathing and moaning)

172
00:14:00,313 --> 00:14:01,146
- Ah.

173
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:05,323
♪ Behold 10 horses, hell rider, hellfire ♪

174
00:14:05,323 --> 00:14:07,681

178
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:17,687
(moaning)

179
00:14:17,687 --> 00:14:19,755
Among the many side effects
of my mutant pussy's

180
00:14:19,755 --> 00:14:22,355
hyper metabolism, my reproductive organs

181
00:14:22,355 --> 00:14:24,916
function at an accelerated rate.

182
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,568
When I was a little girl before
I even knew what sex was,

183
00:14:27,568 --> 00:14:30,564
I used to walk around
having multiple orgasms.

184
00:14:30,564 --> 00:14:32,323
Eight years old, at school,

185
00:14:32,323 --> 00:14:35,162
riding in my dad's station
wagon, dinner with my family.

186
00:14:35,162 --> 00:14:37,523
All I'd have to do is cross
my legs a certain way,

187
00:14:37,523 --> 00:14:39,229
bounce a little too much on my bicycle,

188
00:14:39,229 --> 00:14:41,074
or just playing in the backyard

189
00:14:41,074 --> 00:14:43,517
and I would come numerous times.

190
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:46,333
I used to think everyone
got off a dozen times a day.

191
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,004
(heavy breathing)

192
00:14:49,004 --> 00:14:51,984
But as my vagina evolved, my
body has gone into overdrive.

193
00:14:51,984 --> 00:14:54,227
For instance, conceiving,
going into labor,

194
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,064
and delivering a baby in under two hours

195
00:14:56,064 --> 00:14:57,709
is something sort of new for me.

196
00:14:57,709 --> 00:15:00,093
And something I initially
found rather appalling.

197
00:15:00,093 --> 00:15:02,980
I mean, I could always
take the usual precautions,

198
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,296
but though I don't want any children,

199
00:15:05,296 --> 00:15:07,319
especially any of my freak babies,

200
00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:09,901
I love the feeling of
something alive and kicking

201
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:11,021
and pushing it's way out of me.

202
00:15:11,021 --> 00:15:11,987
(baby crying)

203
00:15:11,987 --> 00:15:13,546
Sometimes it's better than coming.

204
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:16,046
(baby crying)

205
00:15:27,731 --> 00:15:30,231
(eerie music)

206
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,864
We all know the phrase nymphomaniac

207
00:16:11,864 --> 00:16:13,448
is a pejorative term created by men

208
00:16:13,448 --> 00:16:15,938
who are threatened by a
woman's sexual freedom.

209
00:16:15,938 --> 00:16:17,823
Men pride themselves on
their own promiscuity

210
00:16:17,823 --> 00:16:19,349
while women are punished for it

211
00:16:19,349 --> 00:16:21,916
with labels like sluts, bitches, and hoes.

212
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,647
Well I'm all of that and more.

213
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:27,319
I may, in fact, be the world's
only real life nymphomaniac.

214
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,111
However, and I know you'll
find this hard to believe,

215
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:32,642
but I never had a man until two years ago.

216
00:16:32,642 --> 00:16:33,922
Between doctors and my parents,

217
00:16:33,922 --> 00:16:35,288
I grew up believing my
cootch was something

218
00:16:35,288 --> 00:16:38,406
so dirty and disgusting that
no guy would ever want me.

219
00:16:38,406 --> 00:16:40,525
All of which changed when I met Ryan.

220
00:16:40,525 --> 00:16:43,221
I thought I loved him,
I gave him my trust.

221
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:45,823
And when I told him about
my strange little deformity,

222
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,265
he said all the right things.

223
00:16:47,265 --> 00:16:48,596
- Yeah, baby, you know you mean more

224
00:16:48,596 --> 00:16:50,097
to me than any physical problem.

225
00:16:50,097 --> 00:16:52,375
Can't let that get in our way.

226
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,345
You can't let anything get in our way.

227
00:16:54,345 --> 00:16:57,178
Ain't no problem too big as
long as we have each other.

228
00:16:57,178 --> 00:16:59,472
And what we have here,
baby, is something special.

229
00:16:59,472 --> 00:17:00,305
- [Jennifer] Ah!

230
00:17:00,305 --> 00:17:02,873
- So special I wanna spend
the rest of my life with you.

231
00:17:02,873 --> 00:17:05,343
I love your lips, I love
your hair, I love your skin.

232
00:17:05,343 --> 00:17:07,655
From the moment I wake up
to the moment I go to sleep,

233
00:17:07,655 --> 00:17:08,846
you're all I think of.

234
00:17:08,846 --> 00:17:10,833
I'll do anything for you, baby, anything.

235
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,087
I wanna spend every moment
making you feel good,

236
00:17:13,087 --> 00:17:14,835
making you happy, protecting you.

237
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:16,193
You're everything to me, baby.

238
00:17:16,193 --> 00:17:17,421
You give my life meaning.

239
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:20,552
This ain't about sex, it's
about marriage and children,

240
00:17:20,552 --> 00:17:21,910
and growing old together.

241
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,291
It's about us taking our
love to the next level.

242
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,549
I'll make sure you're first
time is special, baby.

243
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:27,382
I promise.

244
00:17:27,382 --> 00:17:29,652
I know you want me just
as much as I want you.

245
00:17:29,652 --> 00:17:31,717
You feel it, you can
feel it, baby, can't you?

246
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,683
(record scratching)

247
00:17:34,683 --> 00:17:36,933
(dripping)

248
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,773
(heavy breathing)

249
00:17:58,501 --> 00:17:59,334
Get up.

250
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:00,291
Get up, get up.
- What, what?

251
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,124
- [Ryan] Get up, come on.

252
00:18:01,124 --> 00:18:02,187
You gotta go, you gotta go.
- Ryan.

253
00:18:02,187 --> 00:18:03,020
- You gotta go.
- Ryan.

254
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:03,853
Come on, go.

255
00:18:03,853 --> 00:18:04,686
You gotta go!
- Ryan.

256
00:18:04,686 --> 00:18:05,519
- Get up, get outta here.

257
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:06,352
- What are you doing?
- You got to get

258
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:07,185
the fuck outta here!

259
00:18:07,185 --> 00:18:08,488
- What are you doing?
- Get the fuck outta here

260
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:09,483
you fucking freak!

261
00:18:09,483 --> 00:18:10,566
Get outta here!

262
00:18:10,566 --> 00:18:11,399
Get outta here!

263
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:13,278
Get out, get the fuck out!

264
00:18:13,278 --> 00:18:14,476
- [Jennifer Voiceover]
Obviously, I do everything

265
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:16,349
a bit differently now.

266
00:18:16,349 --> 00:18:19,099
(sinister music)

267
00:18:20,043 --> 00:18:21,858
Unlike other so-called nymphomaniacs,

268
00:18:21,858 --> 00:18:25,098
my needs are not psychological,
they're physical.

269
00:18:25,098 --> 00:18:27,785
It starts with a moist
burning itch deep inside,

270
00:18:27,785 --> 00:18:29,990
like a liquid flame that grows and burns

271
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,032
until my pussy feels like it's on fire.

272
00:18:32,032 --> 00:18:34,354
Then it spreads pulsating
through my veins,

273
00:18:34,354 --> 00:18:36,795
under my skin, up my arms, down my legs,

274
00:18:36,795 --> 00:18:39,520
and into my breasts, until
my entire body's so hot

275
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,548
and trembling it feels
like my flesh is burning

276
00:18:41,548 --> 00:18:43,562
and crackling and turning into ash,

277
00:18:43,562 --> 00:18:46,398
and only an orgasm
brings me back to normal.

278
00:18:46,398 --> 00:18:49,882
In other words, I need a dick
the way a junkie needs a fix.

279
00:18:49,882 --> 00:18:54,882
(electricity crackling)
(sinister music)

280
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,130
For years I used to hate God.

281
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,617
What kind of bastard creator
would make me this way.

282
00:19:32,617 --> 00:19:34,429
I would fantasize about
spitting in his face

283
00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:36,339
and ripping his eyeballs
out and inflicting

284
00:19:36,339 --> 00:19:39,460
in him the same pain he's inflicted in me.

285
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,424
But I've now learned to understand him.

286
00:19:41,424 --> 00:19:43,464
I now realize just how loving God is.

287
00:19:43,464 --> 00:19:45,955
He loves me so much that
he's given me a gift.

288
00:19:45,955 --> 00:19:47,328
I can feel seven times the sexual

289
00:19:47,328 --> 00:19:48,975
pleasure of any human being.

290
00:19:48,975 --> 00:19:50,705
And now he's giving me babies.

291
00:19:50,705 --> 00:19:52,383
Not for me to keep, of course,

292
00:19:52,383 --> 00:19:54,921
but as a preparation for his holy child.

293
00:19:54,921 --> 00:19:56,626
God has been building
and designing my body

294
00:19:56,626 --> 00:19:59,414
for one purpose and one purpose only.

295
00:19:59,414 --> 00:20:01,761
God wants to fuck me.

296
00:20:01,761 --> 00:20:03,221
- I can feel your aura.

297
00:20:03,221 --> 00:20:07,202
It's glowing, breathing,
it's all around you.

298
00:20:07,202 --> 00:20:08,475
You're protected by angels tears

299
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:09,987
that I can see, you know that?

300
00:20:09,987 --> 00:20:11,364
- You're funny.

301
00:20:11,364 --> 00:20:12,317
- I'm funny.

302
00:20:12,317 --> 00:20:13,150
- In a good way.

303
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,447
- As soon as you started
talking there was such

304
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:18,769
a strong sexual energy
I could just feel it.

305
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:20,269
It's very intense.

306
00:20:21,706 --> 00:20:24,319
I definitely think we have
an amazing connection.

307
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:27,626
- I love your voice, it relaxes me.

308
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:28,459
- Really?

309
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:32,161
I think you're just trying to gas me up.

310
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:33,668
Trying to get me to take you home,

311
00:20:33,668 --> 00:20:34,989
but maybe I'm not that easy.

312
00:20:34,989 --> 00:20:36,935
- Of course you're not.

313
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:41,935
(club music)
(patrons chattering)

314
00:20:59,313 --> 00:21:00,457
- Boy, you're something else.

315
00:21:00,457 --> 00:21:02,865
I wasn't expecting to hook up tonight.

316
00:21:02,865 --> 00:21:05,828
I wasn't even in a social mood.

317
00:21:05,828 --> 00:21:09,995
Just relaxing, having a
drink, and there you were.

318
00:21:11,033 --> 00:21:13,480
There's something very
different about you.

319
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,717
Something very exciting.

320
00:21:15,717 --> 00:21:18,229
Most girls won't let a guy hit it raw.

321
00:21:18,229 --> 00:21:20,312
- Rubbers aren't natural.

322
00:21:22,546 --> 00:21:25,618
- Well I feel comfortable
around you, I feel alive.

323
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,438
Like somebody's blessing you.

324
00:21:27,438 --> 00:21:28,625
Do you have any kids?

325
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:31,054
- Oh, that's complicated.

326
00:21:31,054 --> 00:21:31,998
I'm not there yet.

327
00:21:31,998 --> 00:21:34,095
I wouldn't be the world's best mom.

328
00:21:34,095 --> 00:21:35,598
- I got twins.

329
00:21:35,598 --> 00:21:37,662
Beautiful little girls,
just like their mom.

330
00:21:37,662 --> 00:21:40,199
And they call me (speaking
in foreign language).

331
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:41,525
(heavy breathing)

332
00:21:41,525 --> 00:21:44,496
I loved that woman more than anything,

333
00:21:44,496 --> 00:21:47,106
but she's with some other guy now.

334
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:48,665
I don't let it get me down.

335
00:21:48,665 --> 00:21:51,498
(heavy breathing)

336
00:21:52,582 --> 00:21:55,066
You can't let that negative
energy flow through your system.

337
00:21:55,066 --> 00:21:57,989
You gotta get those
positive juices flowing.

338
00:21:57,989 --> 00:22:00,802
Gotta think good, pure thoughts.

339
00:22:00,802 --> 00:22:03,049
(moaning)

340
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:05,789
- Can I take your picture?

341
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:06,622
- Now?

342
00:22:06,622 --> 00:22:07,458
- Yeah.

343
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:08,291
- Like this?

344
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:09,493
- Yeah.

345
00:22:09,493 --> 00:22:10,326
- Sure.

346
00:22:10,326 --> 00:22:12,597
(heavy breathing and moaning)

347
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:15,917
(camera beeping and clicking)

348
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:19,750
(camera beeping and clicking)

349
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:28,497
(moaning)

350
00:22:30,138 --> 00:22:32,759
(camera beeping and clicking)

351
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:33,938
- Gimme it.

352
00:22:33,938 --> 00:22:35,021
Gimme it.

353
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:35,998
Gimme it.

354
00:22:35,998 --> 00:22:37,803
(moaning)

355
00:22:37,803 --> 00:22:41,636
(camera beeping and clicking)

356
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:46,590
(camera clicking and beeping)

357
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,757
(moaning)

358
00:22:51,927 --> 00:22:55,760
(camera clicking and beeping)

359
00:22:57,327 --> 00:22:59,160
Wow, that was awesome.

360
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:05,006
I'm really not the emotional
type, but I think you're right,

361
00:23:05,006 --> 00:23:07,178
we really have a strong connection.

362
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:08,514
Can you feel it?

363
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:12,903
I mean, I don't know why,
but I feel so close to you.

364
00:23:12,903 --> 00:23:16,081
You think that maybe we
could see each other again?

365
00:23:16,081 --> 00:23:17,164
- Yeah, sure.

366
00:23:19,754 --> 00:23:20,587
Whatever.

367
00:23:22,396 --> 00:23:23,229
- What?

368
00:23:24,121 --> 00:23:24,954
Whatever?

369
00:23:33,623 --> 00:23:34,456
(lamp thumping)

370
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:35,512
(screaming)

371
00:23:35,512 --> 00:23:37,723
I will not be tossed away again.

372
00:23:37,723 --> 00:23:40,632
I'll not be used and toyed
with and played with.

373
00:23:40,632 --> 00:23:44,092
I will not, I will not,
I will not, I will.

374
00:23:44,092 --> 00:23:45,582
Oh my God, I'm sorry.

375
00:23:45,582 --> 00:23:46,810
Oh, I'm so sorry.

376
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:47,643
I'm sorry.

377
00:23:47,643 --> 00:23:48,601
Oh my God.

378
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:52,259
(lamp thumping)
(Jennifer grunting)

379
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:53,739
I'm sorry, I misunderstood.

380
00:23:53,739 --> 00:23:56,114
I thought there was a
spark, a connection here,

381
00:23:56,114 --> 00:23:58,664
and I thought I deserved more
respect and consideration

382
00:23:58,664 --> 00:24:02,247
than a simple whatever,
whatever, whatever.

383
00:24:03,808 --> 00:24:05,104
It's my fault.

384
00:24:05,104 --> 00:24:07,283
It's not you, it's me, it's all me.

385
00:24:07,283 --> 00:24:09,437
I pride myself on not needing
anyone, and what do I do?

386
00:24:09,437 --> 00:24:11,653
I got weak, I got emotional,

387
00:24:11,653 --> 00:24:14,893
and I actually thought that
maybe you and I could...

388
00:24:14,893 --> 00:24:18,883
(lamp thumping)
(Jennifer grunting)

389
00:24:18,883 --> 00:24:20,488
I'm sorry.

390
00:24:20,488 --> 00:24:21,808
Again, I apologize.

391
00:24:21,808 --> 00:24:22,656
This shouldna happened.

392
00:24:22,656 --> 00:24:26,085
It's just that in addition
to my hypermetabolism,

393
00:24:26,085 --> 00:24:28,331
I'm also hyper-emotional.

394
00:24:28,331 --> 00:24:30,925
I can't help it, things
just move faster for me.

395
00:24:30,925 --> 00:24:32,685
Imagine the emotions of meeting someone,

396
00:24:32,685 --> 00:24:34,424
falling in love, getting dumped,

397
00:24:34,424 --> 00:24:38,495
and hating their guts in all
about three anda half minutes?

398
00:24:38,495 --> 00:24:40,995
It's my fault, my fault, my...

399
00:24:44,881 --> 00:24:47,714
(heavy breathing)

400
00:24:57,385 --> 00:24:59,885
(baby crying)

401
00:25:12,773 --> 00:25:15,733
- My ex had a big dick, over 10 inches.

402
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:16,853
I measured it.

403
00:25:16,853 --> 00:25:18,603
Oh, God, he owned me.

404
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:23,020
I would cry real tears
every time he fucked me.

405
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,966
It was so amazing.

406
00:25:24,966 --> 00:25:26,549
I hate small dicks.

407
00:25:28,407 --> 00:25:30,807
I'd rather just finger myself.

408
00:25:30,807 --> 00:25:33,870
- You're crazy, I had nine
inches once and couldn't take it.

409
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,395
I felt like I was getting stabbed.

410
00:25:35,395 --> 00:25:37,257
- I'd be perfect for both of you.

411
00:25:37,257 --> 00:25:39,595
Not too big, but big enough.

412
00:25:39,595 --> 00:25:42,017
I mean, the ladies love it.

413
00:25:42,017 --> 00:25:45,057
I'm no John Holmes, but
I know how to work it.

414
00:25:45,057 --> 00:25:45,890
- Who?

415
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:49,257
- Holmes, John Holmes, the porn star.

416
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:52,094
He had a 14 inch fucking cock.

417
00:25:52,094 --> 00:25:55,421
Ugly motherfucker, but did over 500 flicks

418
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:58,004
and banged over 10,000 bitches.

419
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:00,753
He's god.

420
00:26:00,753 --> 00:26:01,754
- He's gross!

421
00:26:01,754 --> 00:26:02,877
- Don't kid yourself.

422
00:26:02,877 --> 00:26:04,143
If he whipped his dick out right here

423
00:26:04,143 --> 00:26:06,569
you'd be on your hands
and knees sucking it.

424
00:26:06,569 --> 00:26:07,569
- 14 inches?

425
00:26:08,954 --> 00:26:11,537
Whoa, I'd fuck him in a second!

426
00:26:12,716 --> 00:26:16,266
I'd love to see how much of
that I could fit in my mouth.

427
00:26:16,266 --> 00:26:19,866
Holy shit, how could you not want that?

428
00:26:19,866 --> 00:26:21,178
- It's disgusting.

429
00:26:21,178 --> 00:26:22,431
He was so big he probably couldn't

430
00:26:22,431 --> 00:26:24,171
even get the damn thing hard.

431
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:25,296
- Who cares?

432
00:26:25,296 --> 00:26:26,546
It's 14 inches!

433
00:26:27,408 --> 00:26:30,054
Let him fuck me with just the head.

434
00:26:30,054 --> 00:26:32,546
I wanna be filled the fuck up!

435
00:26:32,546 --> 00:26:34,570
- Dude, if I was John Holmes,

436
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,803
I'd have a stable of hoes
lined up around the block

437
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:39,296
beggin' for it, and I
wouldn't pimp myself out

438
00:26:39,296 --> 00:26:41,608
to those cheap ass fucking pornos either.

439
00:26:41,608 --> 00:26:44,020
They'd have to pay hundreds
if they wanted to see it,

440
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,156
thousands more if they wanted to touch it.

441
00:26:46,156 --> 00:26:49,546
Those pretty boys on
TV, they ain't got shit.

442
00:26:49,546 --> 00:26:53,431
Bitches don't want that,
they just want Johnny Holmes.

443
00:26:53,431 --> 00:26:55,494
- Holmes cock didn't even look human.

444
00:26:55,494 --> 00:26:58,095
It was like some hideous
fleshy tumor and was covered

445
00:26:58,095 --> 00:27:01,206
in veins so thick they
looked like earthworms.

446
00:27:01,206 --> 00:27:04,719
I want a human cock, not
some nasty, swollen growth,

447
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:07,106
not something that looks like a dead eel.

448
00:27:07,106 --> 00:27:11,273
It's disgusting and gross
and repulsive and nasty.

449
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:17,120
(retching)

450
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:24,003
(siren wailing faintly)

451
00:27:27,206 --> 00:27:29,956
(birds chirping)

452
00:27:41,017 --> 00:27:43,184
(moaning)

453
00:27:46,543 --> 00:27:48,145
- Oh, fuck.

454
00:27:48,145 --> 00:27:50,082
Yeah, fuck me.

455
00:27:50,082 --> 00:27:51,531
(moaning)

456
00:27:51,531 --> 00:27:52,364
Oh, fuck.

457
00:27:53,306 --> 00:27:54,540
Oh, yeah.

458
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,373
(moaning)

459
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:57,346
Oh yeah, fuck that pussy, yeah.

460
00:27:57,346 --> 00:27:59,513
(moaning)

461
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:09,573
(speaking drowned out by videos)

462
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,440
- (mumbling) medication is rapidly acting

463
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,540
causing erections (mumbling).

464
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,403
(mumbling) erections within 20 minutes.

465
00:28:31,403 --> 00:28:33,913
Side affects include
nausea, headache, dizziness.

466
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:36,163
(mumbling)

467
00:28:42,651 --> 00:28:43,855
(thumping)

468
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:44,688
Stop it.

469
00:28:48,455 --> 00:28:49,363
(thumping)

470
00:28:49,363 --> 00:28:50,913
Fucking stop it!

471
00:28:50,913 --> 00:28:54,206
- [Girl On Video] Oh, baby, yeah, oh God.

472
00:28:54,206 --> 00:28:55,123
(thumping)

473
00:28:55,123 --> 00:28:57,623
- Told you to fucking stop it!

474
00:28:58,751 --> 00:29:00,084
Shut up!

475
00:29:00,084 --> 00:29:01,834
Shut up and fuck off!

476
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,739
(grunting)

477
00:29:05,739 --> 00:29:07,764
(knocking on door)

478
00:29:07,764 --> 00:29:11,097
(girl on video moaning)

479
00:29:12,152 --> 00:29:15,069
(knocking on door)

480
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:20,606
(knocking on door)

481
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,102
(knocking on door)

482
00:29:23,102 --> 00:29:24,769
I'll be right there!

483
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,591
(knocking on door)

484
00:29:29,591 --> 00:29:32,077
Hold on, just a minute!

485
00:29:32,077 --> 00:29:33,030
(knocking on door)

486
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,947
I'm coming!

487
00:29:36,732 --> 00:29:38,107
(knocking on door)

488
00:29:38,107 --> 00:29:39,024
One second!

489
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:44,336
(knocking on door)

490
00:29:47,884 --> 00:29:48,717
Yeah?

491
00:29:48,717 --> 00:29:51,464
- Yo, what's up, dude, it's
been a minute, what's the deal?

492
00:29:51,464 --> 00:29:53,750
It's me, Rem, you went to
school with my brother.

493
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,874
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

494
00:29:54,874 --> 00:29:56,137
Hey man, what's up?

495
00:29:56,137 --> 00:29:57,725
- Chillin', man, everything's peace.

496
00:29:57,725 --> 00:29:59,624
You look a little banged
up, man, you alright?

497
00:29:59,624 --> 00:30:02,162
- Yeah, man, I've been up all night.

498
00:30:02,162 --> 00:30:03,187
Why?

499
00:30:03,187 --> 00:30:05,924
- Ah man, I heard you lived
in Father Divine's old crib,

500
00:30:05,924 --> 00:30:08,220
and I love the yellow.

501
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,595
Plus this would be a great location

502
00:30:09,595 --> 00:30:11,310
for this photo shoot we're tryin' to do.

503
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,286
- I dunno, man.

504
00:30:12,286 --> 00:30:14,872
I mean, I'm thinkin' of
turnin' this place into a club.

505
00:30:14,872 --> 00:30:16,147
I don't really want people comin' in--

506
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,269
- Yo, you don't wanna fuck
this opportunity up, man.

507
00:30:18,269 --> 00:30:19,299
It's gonna be a hip-hop shoot.

508
00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:20,805
There's gonna be model
bitches, some chronic,

509
00:30:20,805 --> 00:30:21,908
it's gonna be poppin'.

510
00:30:21,908 --> 00:30:23,344
You don't wanna pass this chance up.

511
00:30:23,344 --> 00:30:25,571
- Ah man, I just wanna
be left alone, alright.

512
00:30:25,571 --> 00:30:29,379
- How 'bout a hundred bucks
right now, just like that?

513
00:30:29,379 --> 00:30:32,359
- I could really use five.

514
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:34,226
- For you, five, but I'm
gonna need to come in--

515
00:30:34,226 --> 00:30:35,088
- Yo, can I get it in advance?

516
00:30:35,088 --> 00:30:36,261
I mean like right now?

517
00:30:36,261 --> 00:30:39,178
(knocking on door)

518
00:30:41,514 --> 00:30:44,063
- Oh, shit, Bat-a-tat-tat
with the (mumbling).

519
00:30:44,063 --> 00:30:46,038
Yo, I got that egg nog for
ya, you know what I mean?

520
00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:47,672
Cinnamon cookies, orange marmalade,

521
00:30:47,672 --> 00:30:48,963
motherfucking space skittles.

522
00:30:48,963 --> 00:30:50,028
Man, what can I do for you?

523
00:30:50,028 --> 00:30:51,014
How you been, man?

524
00:30:51,014 --> 00:30:52,003
- Yo great man, I'm good.

525
00:30:52,003 --> 00:30:53,615
Yo here, I got another list for you.

526
00:30:53,615 --> 00:30:54,448
(imitating tires braking)

527
00:30:54,448 --> 00:30:55,531
- Yo, pump your fucking brakes.

528
00:30:55,531 --> 00:30:56,454
Let's build like legos.

529
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:58,954
Your last want list,
cuckoo clock world, man.

530
00:30:58,954 --> 00:31:02,943
I think your elevator's broken, champ.

531
00:31:02,943 --> 00:31:05,479
Yo, I gotta be honest with ya, Batzilla.

532
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:08,078
I got all type of orangutan 'droid-head

533
00:31:08,078 --> 00:31:09,083
motherfuckers comin' through here

534
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:11,469
on some spacey, sprocket, cogs, mo-cogs,

535
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:13,909

00:31:37,015 --> 00:31:38,226
You ain't normal, dude.

550
00:31:38,226 --> 00:31:39,776

Talk human, okay?

563
00:32:01,935 --> 00:32:04,002
You sound like a fucking two-year
old baby, you dumb bitch.

564
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:06,225

- The bitch can't even talk right.

595
00:32:59,331 --> 00:33:01,406
It's like you got palsy or somethin'.

596
00:33:01,406 --> 00:33:05,030
I don't know what the fuck
you're tryin' to tell me.

597
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,014
(glass clinking)

Because I don't know anything

You really need a fucking straight jacket.

638
00:34:28,705 --> 00:34:29,606
Someone needs to put a bullet

639
00:34:29,606 --> 00:34:32,045

00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,481

I'm so horny.

728
00:38:13,454 --> 00:38:16,285
My pussy's so wet, I want it so bad.

729
00:38:16,285 --> 00:38:17,785
Oh fuck me please.

730
00:38:18,811 --> 00:38:20,644

Oh, fuck me, please.

736
00:38:30,672 --> 00:38:33,643
(machinery rumbling and thumping)

737
00:38:33,643 --> 00:38:34,560
- Oh, Glen.

738
00:38:35,799 --> 00:38:38,537
I'm not gonna call you
Batz like everybody else.

739
00:38:38,537 --> 00:38:40,687
You're more than that to me.

740
00:38:40,687 --> 00:38:42,343
You're my Glen-Glen.

741
00:38:42,343 --> 00:38:45,800
Why are you so unhappy, why
are you in so much pain?

742
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,458
Tell me why.

743
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,254
Let me help you, Glen.

744
00:38:49,254 --> 00:38:50,671
I wanna help you.

745
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:55,057
- You can't, you can't,
you wouldn't understand.

746
00:38:55,057 --> 00:38:57,889
- Of course I would understand.

747
00:38:57,889 --> 00:39:00,432
I wanna spend the rest
of my life with you.

748
00:39:00,432 --> 00:39:02,009
I love you, baby.

749
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:03,639
I love you.

750
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:05,072
From the moment I wake up to the moment

751
00:39:05,072 --> 00:39:07,665
I go to sleep, you're all I think of.

752
00:39:07,665 --> 00:39:11,874
I'll do anything for you, baby, anything.

753
00:39:11,874 --> 00:39:15,494
I wanna spend every moment
making you feel good,

754
00:39:15,494 --> 00:39:17,289
making you happy.

755
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:19,626
I'll do anything for you.

756
00:39:19,626 --> 00:39:22,039
You give my life meaning.

757
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:24,075
- I've never told anybody.

758
00:39:24,075 --> 00:39:25,443
- Baby, you know you mean more to me

759
00:39:25,443 --> 00:39:27,419
than any physical problem.

760
00:39:27,419 --> 00:39:29,352
We can't let that get in the way of us.

761
00:39:29,352 --> 00:39:32,184
We can't let anything
get in the way of us.

762
00:39:32,184 --> 00:39:36,633
No problem is too big as
long as we have each other.

763
00:39:36,633 --> 00:39:40,451
And what we have is something special.

764
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:43,178
(machinery rumbling and thumping)

765
00:39:43,178 --> 00:39:46,237
- I got my dick got cut off at birth.

766
00:39:46,237 --> 00:39:48,458
The hospital never told
us exactly what happened,

767
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:49,976
but when they went to cut off

768
00:39:49,976 --> 00:39:52,809
the umbilical cord something went wrong.

769
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:54,325
Of course, they sewed it back on,

770
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,677
but it never worked right
and it wouldn't get hard.

771
00:39:56,677 --> 00:39:58,486
So they gave me some
money and they pushed me

772
00:39:58,486 --> 00:40:01,698
into therapy, but I was just a kid.

773
00:40:01,698 --> 00:40:02,842
It didn't hit till I was thirteen

774
00:40:02,842 --> 00:40:04,911
and realized I was the only teenager

775
00:40:04,911 --> 00:40:06,799
in the world who couldn't jerk off!

776
00:40:06,799 --> 00:40:10,966
(machinery rumbling and thumping)

777
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:14,618
Well, I could have got it up with

778
00:40:14,618 --> 00:40:17,977
certain prescription drugs,
but my parents couldn't pay

779
00:40:17,977 --> 00:40:20,599
good money to give their kid a hard on.

780
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:22,400
Wait till your older, Pops would tell me.

781
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,884
Wait till your eighteen!

782
00:40:23,884 --> 00:40:26,751
Yeah, well thanks a lot
dad, but I need my dick now!

783
00:40:26,751 --> 00:40:29,695
(machinery rumbling and thumping)

784
00:40:29,695 --> 00:40:32,278
(speaking drowned out by machinery)

785
00:40:32,278 --> 00:40:33,943
I tried to put my name
in by lifting weights

786
00:40:33,943 --> 00:40:35,723
and getting into fights.

787
00:40:35,723 --> 00:40:37,278
I wanted to join the football team,

788
00:40:37,278 --> 00:40:40,314
but I didn't want nobody in
the locker room to see it.

789
00:40:40,314 --> 00:40:42,090
So I just kept to myself
and got the bright idea

790
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,711
of injecting steroids and growth hormones

791
00:40:43,711 --> 00:40:46,794
directly into my dick, and it worked.

792
00:40:48,217 --> 00:40:49,930
Finally busted my first nut when I was 17

793
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:52,422
and ended up passing out for eight hours.

794
00:40:52,422 --> 00:40:56,575
But the drugs also made
my dick grow, really grow.

795
00:40:56,575 --> 00:40:59,658
It also made my goddamn dick
develop it's own consciousness.

796
00:40:59,658 --> 00:41:03,303
Meaning I got a drug addicted
dick with a mind of it's own!

797
00:41:03,303 --> 00:41:04,487
So now I go from dealer to dealer

798
00:41:04,487 --> 00:41:07,167
lookin' for a chemical
that can control it,

799
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:08,835
that can make me behave normally.

800
00:41:08,835 --> 00:41:12,929
- Fuck me, baby, fuck
me, put it in (moaning).

801
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:13,762
Oh yeah.

802
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:21,174
(moaning)
(machinery rumbling)

803
00:41:27,498 --> 00:41:31,411
(steam hissing)
(moaning)

804
00:41:31,411 --> 00:41:33,828
Oh yes, oh yes, oh baby, yes!

805
00:41:37,035 --> 00:41:38,958
(moaning)

806
00:41:38,958 --> 00:41:40,791
Oh, oh, yeah, oh yeah!

807
00:41:43,257 --> 00:41:44,090
Oh, yeah.

808
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:47,206
(moaning)

809
00:41:52,772 --> 00:41:55,272
(dove cooing)

810
00:41:57,154 --> 00:41:59,737
♪ I'm the boss ♪

811
00:42:01,499 --> 00:42:04,557
- Damn girl, I could
suck on that all night.

812
00:42:04,557 --> 00:42:06,118
On the real, cousin, we could run

813
00:42:06,118 --> 00:42:07,939
the ultimate train on this bitch.

814
00:42:07,939 --> 00:42:11,184
You take the face and I'll
take the back shots (laughing).

815
00:42:11,184 --> 00:42:12,413
- [Jennifer] Okay everybody, snuggle up.

816
00:42:12,413 --> 00:42:13,440
One big happy family.

817
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,979
- Yo what the fuck, where
the models at y'all?

818
00:42:14,979 --> 00:42:16,120
I want some beautiful women.

819
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,705
- They are beautiful.

820
00:42:17,705 --> 00:42:19,466
- I'd wiggle my nose inside your clit

821
00:42:19,466 --> 00:42:21,879
and talk (mumbling) inside your brain.

822
00:42:21,879 --> 00:42:24,297
I'd make love to your
thoughts and memories, mama.

823
00:42:24,297 --> 00:42:25,847
- This is disgusting.

824
00:42:25,847 --> 00:42:27,031
Vulgar and disgusting.

825
00:42:27,031 --> 00:42:28,536
- The vagina is not disgusting.

826
00:42:28,536 --> 00:42:30,789
The vagina is a work of art.

827
00:42:30,789 --> 00:42:33,090
- But not when it's on a woman's face.

828
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:36,479
- Oh yeah, I'm into this
ultra biological shit.

829
00:42:36,479 --> 00:42:38,392
- [Jennifer] Good, good, I like that.

830
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:39,747
- Yeah, you my girl.

831
00:42:39,747 --> 00:42:41,830
My science is deep, mama.

832
00:42:42,797 --> 00:42:44,129
- This is pornography.

833
00:42:44,129 --> 00:42:45,744
Plain and simple.

834
00:42:45,744 --> 00:42:48,290
- Yo, B, on the real, the niggas only got

835
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:51,317
one thing on their mind and that's pussy.

836
00:42:51,317 --> 00:42:52,652
True story.

837
00:42:52,652 --> 00:42:54,237
She's just showin' how the fuck it is.

838
00:42:54,237 --> 00:42:57,395
- Alright, kiss, kiss, kiss,
lean into her, just like that.

839
00:42:57,395 --> 00:42:59,228
Alright, that's right.

840
00:43:00,432 --> 00:43:03,250
- This is not clever,
this is not intelligent,

841
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,630
this is not artistic.

842
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:06,869
This is crude, gutter-level filth.

843
00:43:06,869 --> 00:43:07,871
- I'd hit it till my dick poked

844
00:43:07,871 --> 00:43:09,690
through the back of your head, mama.

845
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:12,095
I'd leave your fucking cerebellum cloudy.

846
00:43:12,095 --> 00:43:14,275
- Alright, this stops now, right now!

847
00:43:14,275 --> 00:43:16,924
- Lean into it, that's right, kiss it.

848
00:43:16,924 --> 00:43:19,626
Oh yes, use your finger, there you go.

849
00:43:19,626 --> 00:43:21,729
Use your finger, good!

850
00:43:21,729 --> 00:43:22,846
- This is not what we agreed to,

851
00:43:22,846 --> 00:43:25,259
this is not what the label agreed to.

852
00:43:25,259 --> 00:43:27,412
- Yo fuck it, B, why is you trippin' man?

853
00:43:27,412 --> 00:43:28,813
They don't know what to expect from us.

854
00:43:28,813 --> 00:43:30,377
They can't pigeonhole us, okay?

855
00:43:30,377 --> 00:43:31,515
- This isn't about your definition

856
00:43:31,515 --> 00:43:32,966
of morality or anyone else's.

857
00:43:32,966 --> 00:43:34,229
This is the brutal honest truth

858
00:43:34,229 --> 00:43:37,867
of a woman as a sexual human being.

859
00:43:37,867 --> 00:43:40,700
- You're out of your fucking mind.

860
00:43:44,418 --> 00:43:46,192
- Good, good, good, I love it, finger it.

861
00:43:46,192 --> 00:43:47,400
Oh God, finger it.

862
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,937
That's it, oh God, oh good, finger it.

863
00:43:50,937 --> 00:43:52,104
Oh, oh my God.

864
00:43:53,084 --> 00:43:54,293
Oh yes.

865
00:43:54,293 --> 00:43:56,911
Oh, good, good, oh that's great!

866
00:43:56,911 --> 00:43:59,222
Oh, just like that.

867
00:43:59,222 --> 00:44:00,063
- Damn girl.

868
00:44:00,063 --> 00:44:02,460
- Good, oh yeah, it's so good.

869
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,263
Good, good, good (mumbling).

870
00:44:04,263 --> 00:44:05,903
Go faster, use that tongue.

871
00:44:05,903 --> 00:44:07,585
Use that tongue, oh!

872
00:44:07,585 --> 00:44:11,069
Oh yeah, that's it, that's it, oh God!

873
00:44:11,069 --> 00:44:12,236
Oh, oh my God!

874
00:44:13,311 --> 00:44:15,688
Good, good, good, good, good.

875
00:44:15,688 --> 00:44:18,389
Oh my God, I can't handle this!

876
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:19,222
Oh, yes.

877
00:44:20,335 --> 00:44:21,760
- Okay, okay, okay, wait, wait, wait.

878
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,593
- [Jennifer] I love it!

879
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:23,426
- That's enough!

880
00:44:23,426 --> 00:44:24,516
Enough.

881
00:44:24,516 --> 00:44:25,516
Enough, man.

882
00:44:30,072 --> 00:44:31,901
- Alright, everybody, that's a wrap.

883
00:44:31,901 --> 00:44:34,818
(group chattering)

884
00:44:37,988 --> 00:44:39,686
- Yo, ma, I feel what you're doin'.

885
00:44:39,686 --> 00:44:41,860
- [Reef] Yeah, the sick shit always sells.

886
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:43,510
(man laughing)

887
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:45,343
- It's pretty intense.

888
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,692
- There's somebody there, there's somebody

889
00:45:02,692 --> 00:45:04,449
there behind the door, I can see!

890
00:45:04,449 --> 00:45:06,266
There's somebody there watching me!

891
00:45:06,266 --> 00:45:07,312
Hey, I see him!

892
00:45:07,312 --> 00:45:08,729
There's somebody there, hurry!

893
00:45:08,729 --> 00:45:09,562
Behind the door, behind the door!

894
00:45:09,562 --> 00:45:10,833
- [Crewman] Hey, hey, hey,
hey, what are you doing here?

895
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:11,666
- [Crewman] What you doin'?

896
00:45:11,666 --> 00:45:12,624
- I wasn't gonna do nothin', man.

897
00:45:12,624 --> 00:45:14,206
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, relax, take it easy.

898
00:45:14,206 --> 00:45:15,989
It's only Batz, he lives here.

899
00:45:15,989 --> 00:45:18,196
You ain't gotta get all
Quasimodo on us, man.

900
00:45:18,196 --> 00:45:19,225
You're a bugged out dude.

901
00:45:19,225 --> 00:45:21,090
- I'm sorry, man, I didn't
wanna be in the way.

902
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:25,090
- Come on, I want you to
meet some of my people.

903
00:45:25,929 --> 00:45:28,312
Batz, this is Vinnie
Paz, Jedi Mind Tricks.

904
00:45:28,312 --> 00:45:29,379
- What up, cousin.

905
00:45:29,379 --> 00:45:31,052
Your crib is crazy, man.

906
00:45:31,052 --> 00:45:32,339
- That's Reef, the Lost Cause.

907
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:34,206
- What's goin' on, B?

908
00:45:34,206 --> 00:45:35,316
- And I wanna introduce you to Jen,

909
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:36,149
she's the photographer--

910
00:45:36,149 --> 00:45:38,138
- So what were you doing
back there, sneaky boy?

911
00:45:38,138 --> 00:45:39,391
- And this is Tina Krause.

912
00:45:39,391 --> 00:45:40,655
She does horror films.

913
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:41,488
- Hi.

914
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:42,761
- You don't have to hide.

915
00:45:42,761 --> 00:45:45,012
I'll let you watch if
you'd take your shirt off.

916
00:45:45,012 --> 00:45:45,845
- I'm sorry, I was--

917
00:45:45,845 --> 00:45:47,168
- You wearing underwear under those jeans?

918
00:45:47,168 --> 00:45:48,802
- Tina, he said he was sorry.

919
00:45:48,802 --> 00:45:50,926
- I know what you were
lookin' for back there.

920
00:45:50,926 --> 00:45:54,282
You were lookin' for
these, big and beautiful.

921
00:45:54,282 --> 00:45:56,043
Your mama ain't got titties like these!

922
00:45:56,043 --> 00:45:57,171
- Let it go, Tina.

923
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,004
Come on.

924
00:46:00,274 --> 00:46:01,176
Hey Jen, this is Batz.

925
00:46:01,176 --> 00:46:02,685
He's the one who hooked
everything up for us.

926
00:46:02,685 --> 00:46:04,985
- Thanks for letting us
shoot here, I appreciate it.

927
00:46:04,985 --> 00:46:06,490
- Hey man, I gotta go do something.

928
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:08,073
- What?

929
00:46:08,073 --> 00:46:11,240
Real nice (mumbling).

930
00:46:14,784 --> 00:46:16,701
- Hey, where you goin'?

931
00:46:18,512 --> 00:46:20,130
Wanna play?

932
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:24,995
Come on, come on puppy dog
eyes, wanna see my titties?

933
00:46:24,995 --> 00:46:28,617
Stick out your puppy dog tail and wag it.

934
00:46:28,617 --> 00:46:31,841
They're tasty little treats
for good little puppies.

935
00:46:31,841 --> 00:46:33,576
And I know you want it.

936
00:46:33,576 --> 00:46:37,440
So why don't you stick out
your paw and beg for 'em?

937
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,338
Okay?

938
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:40,838
(eerie music)

939
00:46:55,711 --> 00:47:00,711
(fabric ripping)
(flesh thumping)

940
00:47:05,914 --> 00:47:07,660
- Jen, everyone's gone, should I lock it?

941
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,557
- Oh, I left my phone inside.

942
00:47:09,557 --> 00:47:10,515
- Want me to get it?

943
00:47:10,515 --> 00:47:11,723
- No, I'll get it.

944
00:47:11,723 --> 00:47:12,556
- Alright.

945
00:47:12,556 --> 00:47:14,806
- I know right where it is.

946
00:47:19,608 --> 00:47:22,358
(sinister music)

947
00:48:07,181 --> 00:48:09,402
- Stop it, stop it!

948
00:48:09,402 --> 00:48:12,399
(grunting)

949
00:48:12,399 --> 00:48:13,816
No, no, she left!

950
00:48:14,942 --> 00:48:17,774
She's gone, they're all gone!

951
00:48:17,774 --> 00:48:18,839
What?

952
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:21,112
Right there in front of everybody!

953
00:48:21,112 --> 00:48:23,136
What are you, crazy?

954
00:48:23,136 --> 00:48:24,553
Okay, no, no, no.

955
00:48:27,107 --> 00:48:28,001
Why?

956
00:48:28,001 --> 00:48:29,424
Because I said so.

957
00:48:29,424 --> 00:48:30,886
Hey, hey, hey!

958
00:48:30,886 --> 00:48:32,476
You don't give the orders here!

959
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:33,831
Fucking shut up!

960
00:48:33,831 --> 00:48:35,373
What the fuck is wrong with you?

961
00:48:35,373 --> 00:48:36,213
The fuck!

962
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:37,053
Get the fuck out!

963
00:48:37,053 --> 00:48:39,720
(door slamming)

964
00:48:42,022 --> 00:48:42,855
- You find it?

965
00:48:42,855 --> 00:48:43,688
- Huh?

966
00:48:43,688 --> 00:48:44,521
- Your phone.

967
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:46,259
- Yeah, it was right where I left it.

968
00:48:46,259 --> 00:48:47,092
That guy in there.

969
00:48:47,092 --> 00:48:47,925
- Who, Batz?

970
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:48,791
- Yeah, what do you know about him?

971
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:50,242
- His real name's Glen Batten.

972
00:48:50,242 --> 00:48:53,897
He got that nickname because
he's so fucking weird.

973
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:55,784
(moaning)

974
00:48:55,784 --> 00:48:58,106
- Shut up, shut up.

975
00:48:58,106 --> 00:49:00,175
I don't feel good.

976
00:49:00,175 --> 00:49:02,592
I can't handle you right now.

977
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,750
(coughing)

978
00:49:07,118 --> 00:49:08,914
Leave me alone.

979
00:49:08,914 --> 00:49:09,914
I feel sick.

980
00:49:11,291 --> 00:49:13,799
Oh no, it's too soon.

981
00:49:13,799 --> 00:49:16,132
This stuff's way too strong.

982
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:20,073
(coughing)

983
00:49:21,346 --> 00:49:23,763
Oh my God, alright, alright.

984
00:49:23,763 --> 00:49:25,180
Shut the fuck up.

985
00:49:27,146 --> 00:49:28,276
Alright.

986
00:49:28,276 --> 00:49:31,359
(video girl moaning)

987
00:49:38,557 --> 00:49:41,057
- [Porn Model] Oh that's good.

988
00:50:15,816 --> 00:50:20,816
(horns honking faintly)
(traffic rumbling)

989
00:51:02,004 --> 00:51:05,254
(pill bottle rattling)

990
00:51:19,137 --> 00:51:21,720
(uneasy music)

991
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:36,458
(heavy breathing)

992
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:01,531
- Where are we going?

993
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:03,614
- Upstairs, second floor.

994
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,237
- Anyone live here?

995
00:54:19,237 --> 00:54:20,070
- Yeah, me.

996
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:21,865
I'm thinking of turning
this place into a club.

997
00:54:21,865 --> 00:54:24,775
- Cool, you got the money?

998
00:54:24,775 --> 00:54:25,920
- This okay?

999
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,035
- Come on, baby, let's
get your clothes off.

1000
00:54:30,035 --> 00:54:32,397
- I haven't done this in a while.

1001
00:54:32,397 --> 00:54:34,945
- Don't be afraid, I'll treat you right.

1002
00:54:34,945 --> 00:54:37,347
- I don't know, my dick's kinda...

1003
00:54:37,347 --> 00:54:38,180
I don't know how to say it.

1004
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:41,145
- Well let's just put this
on and everything'll be fine.

1005
00:54:41,145 --> 00:54:42,504
- [Batz] Maybe we should just forget it.

1006
00:54:42,504 --> 00:54:45,754
- [Hooker] Relax, we're gonna have fun.

1007
00:54:50,508 --> 00:54:53,591
(sinister breathing)

1008
00:54:57,982 --> 00:54:59,514
(hooker gasping)

1009
00:54:59,514 --> 00:55:02,019
(moaning)
(sinister breathing)

1010
00:55:02,019 --> 00:55:03,835
(squealing)

1011
00:55:03,835 --> 00:55:08,835
(moaning)
(heavy breathing)

1012
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:28,437
(moaning)

1013
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,581
- It's okay, we're done now.

1014
00:55:46,581 --> 00:55:48,721
(moaning and squealing)

1015
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:50,561
Come on, you gotta go.

1016
00:55:50,561 --> 00:55:52,992
(moaning)

1017
00:55:52,992 --> 00:55:54,819
come on, you gotta leave.

1018
00:55:54,819 --> 00:55:55,829
You gotta go.

1019
00:55:55,829 --> 00:55:59,162
(moaning and squealing)

1020
00:56:04,314 --> 00:56:06,545
Come on, get up, yeah.

1021
00:56:06,545 --> 00:56:09,169
(moaning)

1022
00:56:09,169 --> 00:56:10,066
Shut up!

1023
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:11,087
Just shut up!

1024
00:56:11,087 --> 00:56:11,920
Shut up.

1025
00:56:14,343 --> 00:56:16,510
(moaning)

1026
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:20,970
Alright, come on.

1027
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:22,232
On your feet, come on.

1028
00:56:22,232 --> 00:56:23,772
Get up, just like that.

1029
00:56:23,772 --> 00:56:24,689
Yeah, okay.

1030
00:56:26,636 --> 00:56:28,973
Okay, you're gonna leave now, okay?

1031
00:56:28,973 --> 00:56:29,806
(moaning)

1032
00:56:29,806 --> 00:56:31,950
(body thumping)

1033
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:35,283
(moaning and squealing)

1034
00:56:46,353 --> 00:56:48,059
Come on, it's time to go!

1035
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:50,120
This ain't fuckin' funny anymore!

1036
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,838
What the hell are you tryin' to do to me?

1037
00:56:52,838 --> 00:56:54,456
I'm gonna turn out the lights and leave.

1038
00:56:54,456 --> 00:56:56,881
You'll be up here all alone!

1039
00:56:56,881 --> 00:56:58,525
What the fuck's wrong with you?

1040
00:56:58,525 --> 00:57:01,172
Come on, let's go, let's go!

1041
00:57:01,172 --> 00:57:02,005
The fuck!

1042
00:57:02,918 --> 00:57:07,668
(moaning)
(uneasy music)

1043
00:57:35,963 --> 00:57:37,919
Hey yo, those animal steroids you gave me.

1044
00:57:37,919 --> 00:57:38,877
Could there be side effects that'll

1045
00:57:38,877 --> 00:57:40,325
make someone else flip out?

1046
00:57:40,325 --> 00:57:42,114
- [Dealer] You gave that
shit to somebody else?

1047
00:57:42,114 --> 00:57:44,452
- No, I fucked a hooker
and she's goin' nuts,

1048
00:57:44,452 --> 00:57:46,377
act like she's out of her fucking mind.

1049
00:57:46,377 --> 00:57:47,210
- [Dealer] So?

1050
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:49,030
- So I stuck it in and she went psycho.

1051
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:51,192
She's either having one big
orgasm or hundreds of 'em

1052
00:57:51,192 --> 00:57:53,064
all in a row, I can't even fucking tell.

1053
00:57:53,064 --> 00:57:54,309
- [Dealer] Yo, you're
high right now, right?

1054
00:57:54,309 --> 00:57:56,971
- No man, I'm not, I'm just scared man.

1055
00:57:56,971 --> 00:57:57,943
This ain't natural.

1056
00:57:57,943 --> 00:57:58,985
I didn't even last.

1057
00:57:58,985 --> 00:58:00,392
It was quick, just in and out.

1058
00:58:00,392 --> 00:58:01,610
But she's been havin' an orgasm

1059
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:03,934
for like almost 45 minutes now.

1060
00:58:03,934 --> 00:58:05,565
45 fucking minutes!

1061
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:08,326
That can't be normal, that's
like impossible, right man?

1062
00:58:08,326 --> 00:58:09,915
Yo, listen.

1063
00:58:09,915 --> 00:58:12,082
(moaning)

1064
00:58:15,198 --> 00:58:16,833
I'm not even near her and
she's shakin' and moanin'

1065
00:58:16,833 --> 00:58:18,464
like she's the fuckin' exorcist.

1066
00:58:18,464 --> 00:58:21,019
It's like Linda Blair right
in your fuckin' livin' room.

1067
00:58:21,019 --> 00:58:22,190
- [Dealer] So why you call me?

1068
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:24,193
- You gotta give me something
to shut her up, man.

1069
00:58:24,193 --> 00:58:25,180
I don't mean knock her out,

1070
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:26,460
just something that'll snap her out of it

1071
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:27,986
so I can get her the fuck outta here!

1072
00:58:27,986 --> 00:58:29,366
You got somethin' for that, right?

1073
00:58:29,366 --> 00:58:30,988
- [Dealer] Yo man, hit that ho on the head

1074
00:58:30,988 --> 00:58:32,942
with a fucking shovel,
shove a pillow in her mouth,

1075
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:35,094
call the ambulance, bury
the bitch in the back yard,

1076
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:36,052
I don't know.

1077
00:58:36,052 --> 00:58:38,223
Whatever the fuck you do,
keep my name out of it.

1078
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:40,404
I ain't got nothing to do with
you, cuz, none of this shit.

1079
00:58:40,404 --> 00:58:41,508
I don't even know you, man.

1080
00:58:41,508 --> 00:58:43,224
(dial tone humming)

1081
00:58:43,224 --> 00:58:45,391
(moaning)

1082
00:58:54,725 --> 00:58:56,379
- Alright, okay, listen.

1083
00:58:56,379 --> 00:58:58,782
We're gonna go now, okay?

1084
00:58:58,782 --> 00:59:01,525
If you can't walk, I'll carry you, okay?

1085
00:59:01,525 --> 00:59:02,768
But I can't take you outside if you're

1086
00:59:02,768 --> 00:59:04,951
gonna be screaming like
this, you understand?

1087
00:59:04,951 --> 00:59:06,134
(moaning)

1088
00:59:06,134 --> 00:59:07,881
Alright, I'm just gonna
put this in your mouth

1089
00:59:07,881 --> 00:59:09,977
just to shut you up, alright?

1090
00:59:09,977 --> 00:59:12,519
(muffled moaning)

1091
00:59:12,519 --> 00:59:15,102
(uneasy music)

1092
00:59:22,146 --> 00:59:24,979
(muffled moaning)

1093
00:59:33,429 --> 00:59:35,596
(moaning)

1094
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:56,800
(moaning)

1095
01:00:02,487 --> 01:00:04,654
(moaning)

1096
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,613
(moaning)

1097
01:00:23,496 --> 01:00:26,329
(heavy breathing)

1098
01:00:48,017 --> 01:00:49,483
I said no.

1099
01:00:49,483 --> 01:00:52,469
No, keep wanting, I don't care.

1100
01:00:52,469 --> 01:00:54,431
I'm not taking any more of that shit!

1101
01:00:54,431 --> 01:00:56,417
It's making me sick.

1102
01:00:56,417 --> 01:00:57,274
Look at me, man.

1103
01:00:57,274 --> 01:00:59,814
My hands are shaking,
my stomach's burning.

1104
01:00:59,814 --> 01:01:01,135
What?

1105
01:01:01,135 --> 01:01:03,582
No way, you saw what you did to her!

1106
01:01:03,582 --> 01:01:04,643
She's probably still in the alley

1107
01:01:04,643 --> 01:01:06,701
screaming her fucking head off!

1108
01:01:06,701 --> 01:01:07,677
What?

1109
01:01:07,677 --> 01:01:11,019
Yeah, well I fucking hate you too!

1110
01:01:11,019 --> 01:01:11,852
Shut up!

1111
01:01:12,708 --> 01:01:14,125
Shut up, shut up!

1112
01:01:16,056 --> 01:01:18,973
(knocking on door)

1113
01:01:21,402 --> 01:01:24,319
(knocking on door)

1114
01:01:25,969 --> 01:01:26,802
(knocking on door)

1115
01:01:26,802 --> 01:01:28,293
Alright, alright, just shut up, shut up.

1116
01:01:28,293 --> 01:01:30,213
Listen, we'll deal with
this later, alright?

1117
01:01:30,213 --> 01:01:33,130
(knocking on door)

1118
01:01:35,973 --> 01:01:36,806
Hi.

1119
01:01:36,806 --> 01:01:38,832
- Mr. Batten, I'm from the
Neighborhood Block Association.

1120
01:01:38,832 --> 01:01:40,850
We have some complaints about you.

1121
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:42,360
- Me, why?

1122
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,010
- The place is still yellow,

1123
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:45,757
the grounds are still overgrown,

1124
01:01:45,757 --> 01:01:46,691
and the neighbors heard
what sounded like--

1125
01:01:46,691 --> 01:01:47,524
- I like yellow.

1126
01:01:47,524 --> 01:01:49,036
I'm thinkin' of turnin'
this place into a club.

1127
01:01:49,036 --> 01:01:50,462
- No, no club!

1128
01:01:50,462 --> 01:01:51,703
This is a residential street.

1129
01:01:51,703 --> 01:01:53,887
You can't turn this place into a club!

1130
01:01:53,887 --> 01:01:55,253
- Can you say that again?

1131
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:57,423
- I said, this is a residential street,

1132
01:01:57,423 --> 01:01:58,684
you can't turn this place into a club!

1133
01:01:58,684 --> 01:02:01,017
- Shut up, shut up, shut up!

1134
01:02:04,581 --> 01:02:05,835
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, wait.

1135
01:02:05,835 --> 01:02:06,939
What was that?

1136
01:02:06,939 --> 01:02:09,366
- Mr. Batten, the place is still yellow,

1137
01:02:09,366 --> 01:02:11,416
the grounds are overgrown,
and the neighbors heard

1138
01:02:11,416 --> 01:02:13,498
what sounded like a woman
screaming last night.

1139
01:02:13,498 --> 01:02:15,554
- Wait, can you say that again?

1140
01:02:15,554 --> 01:02:17,424
- The neighbors head what sounded like

1141
01:02:17,424 --> 01:02:19,705
a woman screaming last night!

1142
01:02:19,705 --> 01:02:21,621
- Oh, you don't need me anymore?

1143
01:02:21,621 --> 01:02:23,142
You don't need me anymore?

1144
01:02:23,142 --> 01:02:25,040
You don't need me anymore?

1145
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,279
Well here's what I think of that!

1146
01:02:27,279 --> 01:02:32,196
(door thumping)
(grunting)

1147
01:02:38,313 --> 01:02:39,146
- Oh geez.

1148
01:02:41,312 --> 01:02:42,145
Oh geez.

1149
01:02:45,166 --> 01:02:45,999
Oh my God.

1150
01:02:50,653 --> 01:02:52,273
Where do I begin?

1151
01:02:52,273 --> 01:02:54,341
You realize we've lost the cover?

1152
01:02:54,341 --> 01:02:58,258
There's no way we can
use these unless we crop,

1153
01:02:59,657 --> 01:03:04,633
blur out the faces, which
kind of renders it pointless.

1154
01:03:04,633 --> 01:03:06,976
I don't think we can use these at all.

1155
01:03:06,976 --> 01:03:11,257
Our advertisers are gonna
have a fit, an absolute fit.

1156
01:03:11,257 --> 01:03:13,211
You know I've always supported you,

1157
01:03:13,211 --> 01:03:15,305
trusted your professional instincts.

1158
01:03:15,305 --> 01:03:17,544
I wanted you for this
assignment because I thought

1159
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:21,245
you'd come up with something
controversial, edgy.

1160
01:03:21,245 --> 01:03:24,401
But this is so far over the edge.

1161
01:03:24,401 --> 01:03:26,834
Remember the Cameron fashion shoot?

1162
01:03:26,834 --> 01:03:30,706
We had two photos with
a single bare nipple

1163
01:03:30,706 --> 01:03:33,107
in each one, tastefully shot.

1164
01:03:33,107 --> 01:03:34,499
Remember what happened?

1165
01:03:34,499 --> 01:03:37,372
Walmart yanked the magazine off the shelf.

1166
01:03:37,372 --> 01:03:39,330
Barnes and Noble wouldn't stock 'em

1167
01:03:39,330 --> 01:03:42,228
unless we polybagged 'em
at 50 cents per issue,

1168
01:03:42,228 --> 01:03:45,447
which further killed sales
because no one could look inside.

1169
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:46,828
And what have you come up with?

1170
01:03:46,828 --> 01:03:47,911
Vagina faces!

1171
01:03:49,001 --> 01:03:51,691
Jennifer, vagina faces!

1172
01:03:51,691 --> 01:03:54,131
What were you thinking?

1173
01:03:54,131 --> 01:03:56,040
- It's all going down tonight.

1174
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,076
I'm actually going to go through with it.

1175
01:03:58,076 --> 01:04:00,364
I'm all nervous and jittery
and tingling inside,

1176
01:04:00,364 --> 01:04:01,197
but in a good way.

1177
01:04:01,197 --> 01:04:02,421
Like when I was a little girl about

1178
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:04,997
to rip the wrapping
off a birthday present.

1179
01:04:04,997 --> 01:04:06,469
I didn't realize how much I needed him

1180
01:04:06,469 --> 01:04:07,782
until I finally found him,

1181
01:04:07,782 --> 01:04:10,725
and now I'm all warm
and getting goosebumps

1182
01:04:10,725 --> 01:04:12,093
and I feel him as if he's racing

1183
01:04:12,093 --> 01:04:14,682
through every part of my body!

1184
01:04:14,682 --> 01:04:16,196
And it's about time.

1185
01:04:16,196 --> 01:04:18,776
I deserve to be happy,
I'm sick of being lonely.

1186
01:04:18,776 --> 01:04:20,958
I wanna fall in love like everyone else.

1187
01:04:20,958 --> 01:04:22,234
And why not?

1188
01:04:22,234 --> 01:04:24,567
We were born for each other.

1189
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:30,253
(heavy breathing)

1190
01:04:31,974 --> 01:04:34,724
(sinister music)

1191
01:05:01,542 --> 01:05:04,375
(raspy breathing)

1192
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:07,460
(thumping)

1193
01:05:59,786 --> 01:06:02,417
(car horn honking)

1194
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:04,466
(dog barking)

1195
01:06:04,466 --> 01:06:08,133
(car horns honking faintly)

1196
01:06:25,427 --> 01:06:28,094
(wood creaking)

1197
01:06:38,835 --> 01:06:41,932
(wood creaking

1198
01:06:41,932 --> 01:06:44,849
(wood splintering)

1199
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:49,341
(raspy breathing)

1200
01:06:49,341 --> 01:06:51,924
(uneasy music)

1201
01:07:24,844 --> 01:07:27,677
(raspy breathing)

1202
01:07:50,961 --> 01:07:53,454
(dramatic music)

1203
01:07:53,454 --> 01:07:55,621
(moaning)

1204
01:08:07,388 --> 01:08:08,888
- Yes, I love you.

1205
01:08:09,830 --> 01:08:10,830
I really do.

1206
01:08:12,259 --> 01:08:14,009
Mmhmm, you're my boo.

1207
01:08:15,143 --> 01:08:17,393
You're the best I ever had.

1208
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:21,300
Uh-huh, yep, it meant nothing.

1209
01:08:23,481 --> 01:08:25,160
Neither did he.

1210
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,993
Yep, none of them did.

1211
01:08:27,899 --> 01:08:30,982
They were just, I dunno, I was bored.

1212
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:38,235
(wood splintering)

1213
01:08:38,235 --> 01:08:41,068
(raspy breathing)

1214
01:08:50,753 --> 01:08:52,253
No, it's just you.

1215
01:08:53,531 --> 01:08:54,948
Yeah, my boo-boo.

1216
01:08:58,076 --> 01:09:00,409
No, honest, why would I lie?

1217
01:09:01,375 --> 01:09:04,126
(dramatic music)

1218
01:09:04,126 --> 01:09:06,459
(screaming)

1219
01:09:10,035 --> 01:09:12,202
(moaning)

1220
01:09:23,318 --> 01:09:25,230
(wood thumping)

1221
01:09:25,230 --> 01:09:28,063
(raspy breathing)

1222
01:09:29,989 --> 01:09:31,533
(metal clanging)

1223
01:09:31,533 --> 01:09:34,450
(plastic rattling)

1224
01:09:37,612 --> 01:09:42,529
(moaning)
(dramatic music)

1225
01:09:53,671 --> 01:09:56,338
(wood thumping)

1226
01:10:06,473 --> 01:10:08,084
(raspy breathing)

1227
01:10:08,084 --> 01:10:10,501
(whimpering)

1228
01:10:16,006 --> 01:10:18,501
(screaming)

1229
01:10:18,501 --> 01:10:21,334
(raspy breathing)

1230
01:10:29,972 --> 01:10:30,805
- [Woman] Get out!

1231
01:10:30,805 --> 01:10:33,223
(dramatic music)

1232
01:10:33,223 --> 01:10:35,473
(grunting)

1233
01:10:42,390 --> 01:10:44,557
(moaning)

1234
01:10:51,787 --> 01:10:54,037
(thumping)

1235
01:10:55,521 --> 01:10:58,354
(raspy breathing)

1236
01:10:59,349 --> 01:11:02,063
(water dripping)

1237
01:11:02,063 --> 01:11:04,646
(uneasy music)

1238
01:11:22,258 --> 01:11:25,091
(raspy breathing)

1239
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:45,841
(whimpering)

1240
01:11:48,132 --> 01:11:49,661
(dramatic music)

1241
01:11:49,661 --> 01:11:51,994
(screaming)

1242
01:12:14,014 --> 01:12:17,597
(door opening and closing)

1243
01:12:30,252 --> 01:12:33,085
- I was here last night, watching.

1244
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:37,060
I saw what you did to that woman,

1245
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:39,316
and I want you to do the same thing to me.

1246
01:12:39,316 --> 01:12:41,088
- Are you fucking crazy?

1247
01:12:41,088 --> 01:12:42,672
You saw what happened to her.

1248
01:12:42,672 --> 01:12:44,866
She could be dead by now for all I know.

1249
01:12:44,866 --> 01:12:45,881
She couldn't handle it.

1250
01:12:45,881 --> 01:12:47,305
- But I can.

1251
01:12:47,305 --> 01:12:51,400
I'm built for it, because like
you I'm built differently.

1252
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,135
- Forget it, girly, I can't help you!

1253
01:12:53,135 --> 01:12:54,986
- Not Girly, Jennifer.

1254
01:12:54,986 --> 01:12:56,286
- Yeah, well you're too late!

1255
01:12:56,286 --> 01:12:57,607
It's gone!

1256
01:12:57,607 --> 01:12:59,735
It came off and walked
right the fuck outta here!

1257
01:12:59,735 --> 01:13:02,405
So if you want it, you're gonna
have to go out and find it!

1258
01:13:02,405 --> 01:13:04,942
It's probably out there
doing God knows what!

1259
01:13:04,942 --> 01:13:05,913
- I don't believe you.

1260
01:13:05,913 --> 01:13:07,601
- Yeah, well I don't believe it either,

1261
01:13:07,601 --> 01:13:09,476
but that's what happened.

1262
01:13:09,476 --> 01:13:13,976
So just, just get outta here
and leave me alone, okay?

1263
01:13:30,227 --> 01:13:32,178
After all I've done for it.

1264
01:13:32,178 --> 01:13:34,248
After all the sacrifices I made!

1265
01:13:34,248 --> 01:13:37,224
And it just walked out on me like this.

1266
01:13:37,224 --> 01:13:39,307
No warning, no goodbye, just up

1267
01:13:39,307 --> 01:13:42,532
and leaves in the middle of the night!

1268
01:13:42,532 --> 01:13:44,802
My whole life revolved around it!

1269
01:13:44,802 --> 01:13:45,830
When the doctors gave up,

1270
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:47,555
I'm the one that gave it it's health,

1271
01:13:47,555 --> 01:13:49,818
nurtured it, made it
something to be proud of,

1272
01:13:49,818 --> 01:13:51,993
kept it alive with every
damn drug it needed!

1273
01:13:51,993 --> 01:13:53,653
And what am I?

1274
01:13:53,653 --> 01:13:55,385
A goddamn junky who can't get laid

1275
01:13:55,385 --> 01:13:59,216
while it's out there
fucking whoever he wants!

1276
01:13:59,216 --> 01:14:02,472
It's like, it's like, what do you call it?

1277
01:14:02,472 --> 01:14:04,085
Spermatozoa.

1278
01:14:04,085 --> 01:14:06,900
They got no eyes, no
ears, no face, nothing.

1279
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:09,345
They only exist to do one thing in life,

1280
01:14:09,345 --> 01:14:11,083
find an egg and fuck it!

1281
01:14:11,083 --> 01:14:15,575
The same basic primal instinct
is happening to my dick.

1282
01:14:15,575 --> 01:14:17,697
It's like a radar.

1283
01:14:17,697 --> 01:14:19,410
It wants pussy, it senses pussy,

1284
01:14:19,410 --> 01:14:23,172
won't let nothing get in the way of pussy.

1285
01:14:23,172 --> 01:14:25,150
The most perverse thing is,

1286
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:27,324
I can feel it while he's doing it.

1287
01:14:27,324 --> 01:14:30,891
From out of nowhere, I feel
like I'm the one who's fucking.

1288
01:14:30,891 --> 01:14:33,200
And just when I think I might bust off,

1289
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:36,188
I realize I'm no longer
attached to my own dick.

1290
01:14:36,188 --> 01:14:38,940
Do you know how mocking that is?

1291
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:41,190
(crashing)

1292
01:14:43,805 --> 01:14:44,638
It's back.

1293
01:14:46,576 --> 01:14:49,151
(raspy breathing)

1294
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:51,734
(uneasy music)

1295
01:15:10,396 --> 01:15:11,531
- [Jennifer] What's wrong with it?

1296
01:15:11,531 --> 01:15:12,364
- Withdrawal.

1297
01:15:12,364 --> 01:15:13,404
- Well give it something.

1298
01:15:13,404 --> 01:15:14,530
- It's had too much already.

1299
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:16,447
- We've got to help it!

1300
01:15:20,753 --> 01:15:22,170
It can't breathe.

1301
01:15:23,699 --> 01:15:25,644
(grunting)

1302
01:15:25,644 --> 01:15:26,805
(raspy breathing)

1303
01:15:26,805 --> 01:15:28,572
(grunting)

1304
01:15:28,572 --> 01:15:31,405
(raspy breathing)

1305
01:15:38,071 --> 01:15:40,238
Breathe, breathe, breathe!

1306
01:15:47,225 --> 01:15:49,392
(blowing)

1307
01:15:51,787 --> 01:15:56,069
- Just leave it alone and
get the hell outta here!

1308
01:15:56,069 --> 01:15:57,223
- Is this what it wants?

1309
01:15:57,223 --> 01:15:58,723
- Hey, gimme that!

1310
01:16:00,524 --> 01:16:01,806
- No!

1311
01:16:01,806 --> 01:16:02,639
Let go!

1312
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:05,210
Give it back!

1313
01:16:05,210 --> 01:16:06,043
- Just let go!

1314
01:16:06,043 --> 01:16:06,982
- No!

1315
01:16:06,982 --> 01:16:08,049
No!

1316
01:16:08,049 --> 01:16:10,299
(grunting)

1317
01:16:11,971 --> 01:16:13,304
- I said let go!

1318
01:16:48,981 --> 01:16:50,481
- Don't die on me!

1319
01:17:07,322 --> 01:17:09,693
It's getting better, see?

1320
01:17:09,693 --> 01:17:11,943
(thumping)

1321
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:21,342
(screaming)

1322
01:17:21,342 --> 01:17:23,592
(growling)

1323
01:17:26,366 --> 01:17:27,283
No, no, no.

1324
01:17:30,368 --> 01:17:31,760
Back off.

1325
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:32,593
Back off!

1326
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:35,040
Back off.

1327
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:37,290
(growling)

1328
01:17:50,186 --> 01:17:52,103
(screaming)

1329
01:17:52,103 --> 01:17:55,936
(moaning and heavy breathing)

1330
01:18:04,074 --> 01:18:05,973
Suddenly, everything was clear.

1331
01:18:05,973 --> 01:18:08,169
I now know why I was put on this earth.

1332
01:18:08,169 --> 01:18:11,146
I had long suspected that God
had a special purpose for me,

1333
01:18:11,146 --> 01:18:13,906
and had long hoped that
someday we would be lovers,

1334
01:18:13,906 --> 01:18:15,725
and finally we are.

1335
01:18:15,725 --> 01:18:17,814
I can feel God deep inside me,

1336
01:18:17,814 --> 01:18:20,750
a feeling that transcends
mere bodily intercourse,

1337
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:24,163
transcends any sex any
mortal has every known.

1338
01:18:24,163 --> 01:18:26,041
This is rapture.

1339
01:18:26,041 --> 01:18:28,708
(angelic music)

1340
01:18:38,068 --> 01:18:39,908
I can feel it all inside me.

1341
01:18:39,908 --> 01:18:41,634
The Garden of Eden, Sodom and Gomorrah,

1342
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:44,269
Armageddon, all inside my pussy.

1343
01:18:44,269 --> 01:18:46,634
Plagues, famine, swarms of locusts,

1344
01:18:46,634 --> 01:18:49,508
Joshua, Jacob, Jeremiah, Peter and Paul,

1345
01:18:49,508 --> 01:18:52,464
and all the disciples
deep inside my vagina.

1346
01:18:52,464 --> 01:18:54,535
Heaven and hell, this is a miracle.

1347
01:18:54,535 --> 01:18:56,664
I am a living miracle.

1348
01:18:56,664 --> 01:19:00,033
Our father, who art in
Jennifer, hallowed be thy name.

1349
01:19:00,033 --> 01:19:03,413
God is finally fucking
me and all I now want

1350
01:19:03,413 --> 01:19:06,766
is to feel myself flooded
with his holy seed.

1351
01:19:06,766 --> 01:19:09,016
(gurgling)

1352
01:19:31,925 --> 01:19:34,175
(grunting)

1353
01:19:53,301 --> 01:19:55,406

1354
01:19:55,406 --> 01:19:58,239

1355
01:20:30,561 --> 01:20:31,826
