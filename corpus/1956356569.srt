1
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,273
Okay, log that.

2
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,456
What piece of evidence
finally convinced you...

3
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:53,001
that the body found
at Giva'at Ha Mivtar was crucified?

4
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:56,087
Well, I suppose if you're looking
for a dead giveaway...

5
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,300
I'd really have to say it was the block
of wood and nail in the foot...

6
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,219
that really did the trick.

7
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:06,473
And the Romans were crucifying bodies
for around 400 years.

8
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,017
Why have we only found
one set of remains?

9
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,021
Well, only the lower rungs
of society were crucified.

10
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,398
Then their remains were burned...

11
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,818
or fed to the dogs.

12
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:21,321
- Doctor, I really need a cigarette.
- Then we must go outside.

13
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:22,864
Thank you.

14
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:31,665
So, it's unlikely that you'd find
a crucified man in a rich man's tomb?

15
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,208
Highly unlikely.

16
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,795
Not to mention potentially
catastrophic.

17
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,214
Catastrophic?

18
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:43,969
The only recorded crucified body
in a rich man's tomb was that of...

19
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,221
Rabbi Yeshu Ben Yosef...

20
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,598
known to all of us if not by
his Hebrew name...

21
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:52,227
then surely by his Greek one...

22
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,564
Jesus, son of Joseph.

23
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,359
Sharon! Sharon!

24
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,071
They're here.

25
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,965
- What are all these people doing here?
- Dr. Golban?

26
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:07,010
Moshe Cohen,
Deputy Attache to Jerusalem.

27
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,887
- For your protection, I assure you.
- Yeah, right.

28
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,973
- Now, maywe have a look?
- No.

29
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:15,143
I can't have amateurs trampling
through the dig. You'll break something.

30
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:19,064
Okay. What about a professional?

31
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:23,276
A priest has no place on an excavation.
Do I make myself clear?

32
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,530
Dr. Golban, Pierre Lavelle.

33
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:34,413
Dr. Lavelle, I am so sorry.
I had no idea you were a priest.

34
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,040
I am an archaeologist.

35
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,376
- After you, Doctor.
- Thank you.

36
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,932
All I wanted to do
was dig a basement.

37
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,353
They wanted to put up fats in
about 3 months, so we had to be quick.

38
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,613
Until we remove the body, we're
keeping a low profile in security.

39
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:11,950
Disturbing the dead can get you killed
in this neighborhood.

40
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,848
Father Gutierrez.

41
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,643
Your Eminence.

42
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:28,318
Not many of our priests
are ex-combat soldiers.

43
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:33,699
El Salvador was
a long time ago, Your Eminence.

44
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,660
Military intelligence.

45
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,497
A polite oxymoron.

46
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:44,292
You have been chosen to investigate
a problem for us in Jerusalem.

47
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:50,298
One that will require the wide range
of your investigative abilities.

48
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:00,058
" Dr. Sharon Golban."

49
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,395
An Israeli archaeologist. It was she
who opened the tomb in Jerusalem.

50
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:06,064
Those are photos of what she found.

51
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,609
This is of Pontius Pilate.

52
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,611
So I've been told.

53
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:24,291
Excuse me, Your Eminence,
but this has to be a joke.

54
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:28,670
A dangerous one, which is why we have
chosen you to investigate it.

55
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,672
Yeah, but who would believe this?

56
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:33,216
It reads like
tabloid journalism...

57
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,136
not a serious
archaeological report.

58
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,597
Dr. Golban is
a serious archaeologist.

59
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,434
So is Fr. Lavelle.

60
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,272
He's a Dominican in Jerusalem.

61
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,191
Lectures at their university.

62
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:52,945
What is his opinion about this?

63
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:55,739
There are many tests
to be conducted.

64
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,909
But he has seen the tomb...

65
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,911
and the body.

66
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,373
So he thinks...

67
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,541
it is possible?

68
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,462
But Your Eminence...

69
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:14,424
I have no qualifications
for something like this.

70
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,426
That is not true.

71
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:21,014
You have told us why
in your own words.

72
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:27,479
"I believe Jesus Christ is God
because I spoke to Him this morning...

73
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,816
in my prayers.

74
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:35,153
And I've known He was God
since I was a boy.

75
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:39,074
He has always been my best friend...

76
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:41,827
even though I haven't always
been His.

77
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:47,124
In Him, I have peace."

78
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:54,006
You were called because of your military
and investigative experience.

79
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:57,718
You were chosen because
of what you wrote here.

80
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:06,768
The ideal solution is to stop
rumors and lies at their inception.

81
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:10,147
If not, a Vatican denial
would be interrupted by some...

82
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,149
as merely the Vatican
covering up the truth.

83
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,985
We must stop this before
it lets loose its poison.

84
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,572
We are counting on you
to protect the Church.

85
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:21,116
Protect the faith.

86
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:24,870
They're synonymous. Protect the Church,
you protect the faith.

87
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,582
Your Eminence, what if
the body they found--

88
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:32,127
There is no "what if," Father.

89
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:37,883
This is not the body of Christ.

90
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:41,929
I understand.

91
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,465
Matt Gutierrez?

92
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:21,134
- That's you?
- That's me.

93
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:23,804
Sharon Golban, right?

94
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,473
- Is this your bag?
- Yes.

95
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:28,684
- I'll carry it.
- Short trip, huh?

96
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:49,496
Before you get us killed, I think
there is something I'd better clear up.

97
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:53,125
- I am not an archaeologist.
- What?

98
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,252
The road, please.
Just look at the road.

99
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:58,255
I'm looking at the road.
You have a doctorate, don't you?

100
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:00,841
In Roman history.

101
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:04,178
Anything relevant?
Anything useful?

102
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:06,180
Well, theology.

103
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,815
So, what are you, a priest?

104
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:21,111
Yes, I'm a priest. A priest who is
about to give himself the last rites.

105
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:23,614
So, you're a priest
who's not an archaeologist...

106
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:27,326
sent by the Vatican to investigate
an archaeological dig...

107
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,662
that is going to fuck up the Church
for the rest of time...

108
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:33,123
and I'm expected to believe
that you don't have an agenda?

109
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:37,878
I have no expectations of you other
than keeping your eyes on the road.

110
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,588
- Please.
- Well, I have been ordered...

111
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:43,008
to obey your every command.

112
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,552
Ordered? By whom?

113
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:50,808
Deputy Attache to Jerusalem,
Moshe Cohen.

114
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:54,269
- You guys should get along well.
- Hey, what are you doing?

115
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:20,671
Know this.
I am not gonna lie for you.

116
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,631
Why would I ask you to lie?

117
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:26,218
'Cause my archaeological facts will
confict with your religious beliefs.

118
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:29,638
Don't you forget that.
Are you trying to get us killed?

119
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,057
I thought that was your job.

120
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,219
Listen, I'm --

121
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,764
I'm sorry I came down on you so hard.

122
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:15,434
No, you're not.
That's okay.

123
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,728
What I would really like
is some sympathy...

124
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,938
for scaring me half to death
with your driving.

125
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:23,066
You better get used to it.
All Israelis drive like this.

126
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:26,361
Then all Palestinians have
to do is give you faster cars...

127
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:29,198
and wait for the inevitable.

128
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:32,534
- I'll pick you up at 6:00.
- 11:00.

129
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:35,537
- Time to unpack your bags?
- 11:00.

130
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,343
You must be Patch's nephew.

131
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:54,223
Nobody, and I mean nobody,
gets an advance like this.

132
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:56,558
Not even for the second coming.

133
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:02,940
Oh, and this arrived for you
about an hour ago from Tel Aviv.

134
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,441
Looks important.

135
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,824
You're here for the pope.

136
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:15,661
Actually, I am the pope's nephew.

137
00:17:17,204 --> 00:17:20,874
- It's Jerusalem, isn't it?
- May I see my room now, please?

138
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:27,548
Pope's nephew, eh?
Saint Peter's suite.

139
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:31,301
This way.

140
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:35,681
- What is your name, Father?
- Winstead.

141
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,476
Is Fr. Lavelle in his room?

142
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,271
Yes, he is. It's up the stairs
to the left and across the bridge.

143
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:53,741
Ignoring warnings of armed intervention
by the Israelis...

144
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:56,285
the Palestinian National Authority
announced today...

145
00:17:56,368 --> 00:18:00,748
that it will declare East Jerusalem
the capital of Palestine.

146
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:03,751
Raising the specter
of a biblical armageddon...

147
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,753
Christian fundamentalists
predict the destruction...

148
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:07,463
of their most holy shrines...

149
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:11,216
if the Via Dolorosa should come
under Palestinian rule.

150
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,261
This is John Jays reporting
live from Jerusalem.

151
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,892
I don't have any money.

152
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:21,894
I don't want your money.

153
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:24,271
Just drive.

154
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,795
Fr. Lavelle?

155
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,799
Father, I am Matt Gutierrez.

156
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:55,177
Oh, so you are the chosen one.

157
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:58,055
Yes, the chosen one.

158
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:05,104
Does that disturb you in some way?

159
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:09,858
In the hierarchy of my pain, Father,
that is hardly a novitiate.

160
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,822
I have a few questions,
if you don't mind.

161
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:17,199
All right.

162
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,163
Let me see what we have in here.

163
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:32,715
So, Father, when you entered
the tomb...

164
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:36,427
you believed in the resurrection.

165
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,178
When you left,
you did not.

166
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:41,765
What was it, ten minutes, half an hour?
How long were you there?

167
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:45,894
No, no, no, it was not that I--
I didn't believe.

168
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:50,566
It was that I realized
it was possible that I didn't believe.

169
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:56,196
The oxidation on the wrists
and the legs.

170
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,701
A crucifixion in a rich man's tomb.

171
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:04,413
I know, but Romans gave out crucifixions
like parking tickets.

172
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:09,126
Yeah, but never rich people.
Only criminals or political enemies.

173
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:14,840
"There came a rich man
from Arimathea named Joseph.

174
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:19,178
And Joseph took the body of Jesus
and laid it in his own new tomb...

175
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:23,057
hewn out of the rock, and rolled
a stone against the entrance."

176
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,809
And that is a picture
of a rich man's tomb.

177
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,400
But...

178
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:35,986
so then I understand
no firm date has been established...

179
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,948
for the body or the tomb,
correct?

180
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:43,369
You're forgetting the coin she found.
It was a Pilatus.

181
00:20:45,955 --> 00:20:49,959
Father, isn't it possible the body
in the tomb is that of a Christian?

182
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:53,712
I mean, a follower of Christ
and not Christ himself?

183
00:20:53,796 --> 00:20:56,382
Yes, it is possible. In that case,
it would have been buried...

184
00:20:56,465 --> 00:21:00,302
with some Christian symbol
to illustrate the fact.

185
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:02,554
If not in the open,
then hidden...

186
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:05,599
on the inside of the ossuary or at the
bottom of a jar you would have found...

187
00:21:05,683 --> 00:21:08,686
three concentric circles...

188
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:10,145
or an antique cross...

189
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:12,064
or a fish.

190
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:14,358
So...

191
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:17,611
it was Dr. Golban who asked you
to come to the tomb, correct?

192
00:21:17,695 --> 00:21:22,616
It was Moshe Cohen
from the prime minister's office.

193
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,328
Did he call others?
Did he call Armenians...

194
00:21:26,412 --> 00:21:28,497
Orthodox, Protestants?

195
00:21:28,581 --> 00:21:30,416
Why did he call you, Father?

196
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:33,836
What is all this? Am I supposed
to doubt them because they are Jews?

197
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,590
Father, I understand that
you are in great pain.

198
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:41,051
But you have to let me carry this now.
This is mine.

199
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:43,679
The Holy Father has given it to me.
I don't like it, but I have to take it.

200
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:45,347
But why are you asking me
all these questions?

201
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:49,685
Who said what, who did what,
who intended what! Don't you realize...

202
00:21:49,727 --> 00:21:53,689
what it means if it is He
in that tomb...

203
00:21:53,731 --> 00:21:56,025
the unrisen Christ?

204
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:58,569
The end of Christianity.

205
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:01,655
That someone like you, Father,
could believe that...

206
00:22:01,739 --> 00:22:05,993
is exactly why the Church
wants to know who said what and why.

207
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:11,707
Come on. Believe me.

208
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:15,628
We want to know every speck
of dust in that tomb.

209
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:19,173
We don't wanna lose one soul because
of these things. I mean, not one!

210
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:22,885
And if we have lost you--

211
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:28,974
We don't wanna lose you, Father.

212
00:22:30,726 --> 00:22:33,812
What will you do, Jesuit...

213
00:22:33,896 --> 00:22:37,483
if you discover that
it is Christ in that tomb?

214
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,736
A man like all of us?

215
00:22:45,824 --> 00:22:48,786
I will turn to God for the answer.

216
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,253
You know, I think
it's enough for today.

217
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:01,507
I am sorry I interrupted you.

218
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:08,097
One more thing.

219
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,684
For security reasons,
I think it would be better...

220
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:14,854
to move you someplace where
you can continue your work in private.

221
00:23:15,855 --> 00:23:17,439
All right.

222
00:24:07,615 --> 00:24:09,200
Do you know who I am?

223
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:12,369
Yes. You are Abu Yusef.

224
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:15,331
Let's have some tea and talk.

225
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:26,550
Please.

226
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,893
So, Mr. Hamid...

227
00:24:35,935 --> 00:24:38,312
what can you tell me
about the excavation...

228
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:40,689
behind your store?

229
00:24:40,773 --> 00:24:42,983
I was digging a basement...

230
00:24:43,067 --> 00:24:46,445
when they found
an ancient tile foor.

231
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:50,616
And now,just waiting
to dig a basement.

232
00:24:53,077 --> 00:24:56,872
All that over a foor?

233
00:24:56,956 --> 00:24:59,667
I heard Dr. Golban, the archaeologist,
say something...

234
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:02,670
about the tiles being
from the 12th century.

235
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:05,506
Then why the Shin Beth
is so interested in it?

236
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:09,301
The secret police is interested
in my hardware store?

237
00:25:09,385 --> 00:25:11,011
And the Vatican state.

238
00:25:11,095 --> 00:25:12,471
The Vatican?

239
00:25:12,555 --> 00:25:14,598
You will find out more.

240
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:19,728
How? I'm just a simple shopkeeper.

241
00:25:19,812 --> 00:25:22,273
And I was just a simple teacher.

242
00:25:23,566 --> 00:25:25,609
If it's important to you--

243
00:25:25,651 --> 00:25:27,278
To you too.

244
00:25:29,405 --> 00:25:31,907
To the fate of Jerusalem.

245
00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:36,287
Nothing must prevent us
from making it our capital.

246
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:37,329
Do you think my--

247
00:25:37,413 --> 00:25:41,083
Anything that brings Israelis
and Rome together worries me.

248
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:45,087
That's the reason I need you to be
my eyes and ears. Watch everything.

249
00:25:45,171 --> 00:25:47,506
Who is going in,
who is coming out...

250
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:50,509
what they bring in,
what they take out.

251
00:25:51,719 --> 00:25:54,722
You should contact me immediately.

252
00:26:37,056 --> 00:26:38,516
Thanks.

253
00:26:46,232 --> 00:26:49,777
They've only been told we're protecting
the body from religious extremists.

254
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,457
Do you want 'em to stay?
It's your call.

255
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:05,126
Let them go.

256
00:27:10,506 --> 00:27:13,467
Now we have our first
major archaeological decision.

257
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:17,555
Who goes first,
Church or infidel?

258
00:27:23,936 --> 00:27:26,355
Are you nervous?

259
00:27:38,534 --> 00:27:40,494
Take one of these.

260
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:48,586
Right here is where we found
the Pilatus coin.

261
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:50,379
The coin.

262
00:27:50,463 --> 00:27:53,382
It's a very convenient way
of dating a tomb, right?

263
00:27:53,466 --> 00:27:55,718
Yes, but not the only one.

264
00:28:05,353 --> 00:28:09,482
Now, notice something?

265
00:28:09,565 --> 00:28:12,026
Well, it's empty.

266
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:14,070
Exactly.

267
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:18,199
They peered into the tomb,
and it was empty.

268
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:25,581
Matthew 27, Mark 15,
Luke 23. Yes.

269
00:28:26,374 --> 00:28:29,627
- So?
- That's until you get to the claywall.

270
00:28:34,465 --> 00:28:38,594
Why do you think the wall
was put up in the first place?

271
00:28:39,804 --> 00:28:42,932
To hide something
much more valuable...

272
00:28:44,475 --> 00:28:46,435
than a coin.

273
00:29:07,873 --> 00:29:10,876
What are these orange marks?

274
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,504
That is oxidized iron.

275
00:29:15,381 --> 00:29:18,259
I think they used smaller spikes
than usual...

276
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:22,054
because although iron rusts...

277
00:29:23,431 --> 00:29:26,809
it usually survives
as long as bone in these conditions.

278
00:29:29,854 --> 00:29:32,857
You'll notice here...

279
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,859
that these bones aren't broken.

280
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:36,861
Now, the Romans...

281
00:29:36,944 --> 00:29:41,574
usually break the bones
of the legs...

282
00:29:41,616 --> 00:29:44,118
to speed death.

283
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:48,664
These things came to pass
that scripture might be fulfilled.

284
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,501
Not a bone of His shall be broken,
or something like that.

285
00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:55,129
Exactly like that.

286
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:58,424
And you know it.

287
00:30:03,721 --> 00:30:07,975
From this you determined those were
the bones of Jesus Christ, right?

288
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:10,686
I didn't say that.

289
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:15,691
What I said was the discovery
at this point conforms to the Gospels.

290
00:30:16,651 --> 00:30:18,152
I knew this wouldn't work.

291
00:30:19,236 --> 00:30:21,489
It'll work. It'll work if you--

292
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:24,158
if we stop playing games
with each other.

293
00:30:34,043 --> 00:30:36,921
Mr. Hamid, I believe you have
a visitor.

294
00:30:36,963 --> 00:30:39,840
And you didn't think
to call your friends in Gaza.

295
00:30:41,259 --> 00:30:42,843
I was going to, but--

296
00:30:54,272 --> 00:30:56,983
In the name of Allah,
I'm a Palestinian.

297
00:30:57,066 --> 00:31:01,279
If what's in the tomb causes the Vatican
to side with Israel on Jerusalem...

298
00:31:01,362 --> 00:31:05,074
the other Catholic nations
will follow.

299
00:31:05,157 --> 00:31:08,744
And that, my friend,
will deprive us from our birthright.

300
00:31:08,828 --> 00:31:11,664
Listen, I--

301
00:31:11,747 --> 00:31:15,835
I swear you will hear from me
very soon. Very soon.

302
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:23,175
I want all correspondence
with the Jesuit courier in code.

303
00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:24,552
Well, if you insist.

304
00:31:24,635 --> 00:31:26,178
But it won't do you any good.

305
00:31:26,262 --> 00:31:29,098
Any hacker with half-an-hour's
experience and a modem could crack it.

306
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:30,433
Such as?

307
00:31:30,516 --> 00:31:34,395
Arabs, Israelis, CNN, MTV.

308
00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:37,857
It's like one big
party line out here.

309
00:31:37,899 --> 00:31:40,401
Who's the biggest party guest?

310
00:31:40,484 --> 00:31:44,822
A week ago, we heard the PFJ were
listening in, but why I don't know.

311
00:31:44,864 --> 00:31:47,992
- The PFJ ?
- The Popular Front of Jerusalem.

312
00:31:48,075 --> 00:31:53,623
They're some ex-intifadas out of Gaza,
run by some bloke called Abu Yusef.

313
00:32:01,714 --> 00:32:03,633
Postcards to God.

314
00:32:05,426 --> 00:32:09,055
Do you want to send Him a note,
tell Him you arrived safely?

315
00:32:09,138 --> 00:32:11,516
Or for luck?

316
00:32:13,184 --> 00:32:16,771
Maybe later,
if I really need it.

317
00:32:16,854 --> 00:32:18,314
Let's go.

318
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:31,160
Peace at any price is not peace.

319
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,788
It's a sacrilege.

320
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:35,748
Mr. Cohen.

321
00:32:35,832 --> 00:32:37,416
Moshe, please.

322
00:32:40,503 --> 00:32:44,173
Why did you ask Fr. Lavelle
to look at the body?

323
00:32:44,257 --> 00:32:46,509
He was an obvious choice.

324
00:32:47,635 --> 00:32:49,136
He's an expert in the field.

325
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,597
He's a Catholic priest,
and he was here.

326
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:55,268
And you knew bringing him in
would involve the Vatican...

327
00:32:55,351 --> 00:32:57,603
even though there were
many other choices.

328
00:32:57,645 --> 00:33:00,064
I thought the Church
might appreciate the gesture.

329
00:33:01,399 --> 00:33:04,026
But it seems you look
a gift horse in the mouth.

330
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,987
Look?

331
00:33:08,823 --> 00:33:10,658
I didn't come here
just to look.

332
00:33:13,035 --> 00:33:17,123
You are the most formidable
Christian sect.

333
00:33:17,206 --> 00:33:20,501
To have the state of Israel involved
in something so potentially dangerous...

334
00:33:20,585 --> 00:33:23,504
to the Christian faith
could have serious...

335
00:33:23,546 --> 00:33:24,964
repercussions for us.

336
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:28,384
So, any other agendas
I should be aware of?

337
00:33:29,302 --> 00:33:31,304
Well, quite frankly,
our only agenda...

338
00:33:31,345 --> 00:33:33,431
was to dump this problem
in the Vatican's lap.

339
00:33:33,473 --> 00:33:37,935
We've done that, so now
I'm just here to assist.

340
00:33:37,977 --> 00:33:39,604
All right.

341
00:33:39,687 --> 00:33:43,232
Dr. Golban's preliminary report...

342
00:33:43,274 --> 00:33:44,901
the one I saw in Rome...

343
00:33:44,942 --> 00:33:47,570
has that been published yet?

344
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:49,572
No. Probably later this week.

345
00:33:49,655 --> 00:33:52,283
Stop it.

346
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:54,911
Stop the publication.

347
00:33:54,994 --> 00:33:58,247
And if you don't have
the authority to stop it...

348
00:33:58,331 --> 00:34:00,291
you tell me who does.

349
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:04,086
I have the authority.
I have the authority for that.

350
00:34:06,422 --> 00:34:08,216
And much more.

351
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,802
I'm sure you do.

352
00:34:24,774 --> 00:34:27,777
- Morning.
- I brought you one of these.

353
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,363
Wasn't sure if caffeine's a sin
on a Tuesday morning.

354
00:34:30,446 --> 00:34:33,574
As long as there is no more
than three lumps, I am safe.

355
00:34:33,658 --> 00:34:35,076
Thanks.

356
00:34:38,246 --> 00:34:42,250
I hope you don't mind,
but I thought it best to...

357
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:45,837
postpone publishing your report
in the archaeological journals.

358
00:34:47,255 --> 00:34:49,799
- You did what?
- I saw Moshe Cohen this morning...

359
00:34:49,882 --> 00:34:51,342
and he agreed that--

360
00:34:51,384 --> 00:34:56,472
You had a meeting with Cohen without me
and decided to censor my report?

361
00:34:56,514 --> 00:34:59,475
Yes. I suggested it.

362
00:35:02,186 --> 00:35:04,647
Could you forget
your ego for a while?

363
00:35:04,689 --> 00:35:08,443
You think I filed those reports for
the thousands who fock to newsstands...

364
00:35:08,484 --> 00:35:11,779
to read the latest edition
of the Archaeological Review?

365
00:35:11,821 --> 00:35:15,616
What if I woke up and decided it's not
a good idea for you to say Mass today?

366
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,619
- I stop you.
- Listen to me.

367
00:35:18,703 --> 00:35:22,832
Making your speculations public--
and that's all you have, speculations--

368
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:25,501
is not gonna help the investigation.

369
00:35:25,585 --> 00:35:27,712
My saying Mass harms no one.

370
00:35:27,795 --> 00:35:29,255
- Maybe it does.
- Really?

371
00:35:29,338 --> 00:35:32,633
Maybe it threatens me in the same way
this archaeological find...

372
00:35:32,717 --> 00:35:34,802
is threatening your religion.

373
00:35:34,886 --> 00:35:39,182
I am not threatened. I am just concerned
about knee-jerk reactions.

374
00:35:39,223 --> 00:35:41,893
- And I think you should be too.
- It's your reaction.

375
00:35:41,976 --> 00:35:44,479
It's the Vatican meddling in places...

376
00:35:44,562 --> 00:35:47,315
where religion has no place
that's concerning me.

377
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:48,483
Bullshit.

378
00:35:49,609 --> 00:35:53,905
This is more about religion
than anything else and you know it.

379
00:35:53,988 --> 00:35:56,199
Especially here in Jerusalem.

380
00:35:56,282 --> 00:36:00,703
You're suggesting we throw science,
religion and politics into a mess.

381
00:36:00,787 --> 00:36:02,580
A mess of unpredictable consequences.

382
00:36:02,622 --> 00:36:04,957
I don't like to work like that.

383
00:36:04,999 --> 00:36:08,628
Bullshit is the language
of the new Ecumenical Church, is it?

384
00:36:13,591 --> 00:36:16,969
The coffee's great.
Are you enjoying the show?

385
00:36:17,053 --> 00:36:21,724
It's just your subtle style of
Jesuitical debate. It's very impressive.

386
00:36:21,808 --> 00:36:23,393
Have fun.

387
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:43,830
You're taking this personally.

388
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:46,416
You're bloody right
I'm taking it personally.

389
00:36:59,429 --> 00:37:02,056
I should have called you.

390
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,183
I apologize for that.

391
00:37:04,267 --> 00:37:07,145
I don't apologize
for delaying the publication.

392
00:37:08,646 --> 00:37:11,190
All you had to do was ask.

393
00:37:11,232 --> 00:37:13,609
Would you have agreed?

394
00:37:13,693 --> 00:37:15,945
Now we'll never know,
will we?

395
00:37:38,801 --> 00:37:41,846
We're taking a break.
They're inside.

396
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:43,723
What is next?

397
00:37:43,806 --> 00:37:47,101
Well, I have to dust off
every single one of these bones...

398
00:37:47,143 --> 00:37:49,437
polyvinyl them
and then we can move them.

399
00:37:50,938 --> 00:37:51,898
All right.

400
00:37:53,274 --> 00:37:57,403
There is a body in the tomb,
and old bones.

401
00:37:57,487 --> 00:38:00,323
The man is a Catholic priest
from America.

402
00:38:00,406 --> 00:38:03,493
No, not the same one
that was here before.

403
00:38:05,036 --> 00:38:08,289
I will, as soon as I know
something new.

404
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:25,515
What are you looking for?
A spear mark?

405
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:29,936
Would I find it?

406
00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:31,729
Probably.

407
00:38:31,771 --> 00:38:35,608
But the pathologist
would be more accurate.

408
00:38:35,692 --> 00:38:37,110
Right.

409
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:41,281
Christ was run through
with a spear, wasn't he?

410
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:45,660
Listen. You said something about...

411
00:38:45,743 --> 00:38:48,997
other sources of dating
besides the coin.

412
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,125
Yes, we may find seeds
in the claywall.

413
00:38:53,209 --> 00:38:57,463
And we can compare the style of the oil
lamp with other contemporary examples.

414
00:38:59,674 --> 00:39:02,927
- Will you hold this for me?
- Sure.

415
00:39:07,015 --> 00:39:08,725
Are you okay?

416
00:39:18,776 --> 00:39:21,821
Can you get that box
for me, please?

417
00:39:21,863 --> 00:39:23,781
Yeah, sure.

418
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,170
- What does this say?
- It's just random lettering.

419
00:39:37,253 --> 00:39:39,047
They used to practice
their handwriting...

420
00:39:39,088 --> 00:39:42,175
on pottery before they
transferred it to parchment.

421
00:39:43,885 --> 00:39:46,596
Could this jar have been used
for anointing?

422
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:49,182
Yeah, but we won't know for certain
until the analysis...

423
00:39:49,265 --> 00:39:51,768
on the residue
comes back from the lab.

424
00:39:54,228 --> 00:39:55,438
Why?

425
00:39:55,521 --> 00:39:58,024
Well, according to the Gospels...

426
00:39:58,107 --> 00:40:01,778
the two Marys never finished preparing
Christ's body for burial.

427
00:40:01,819 --> 00:40:04,822
That's why they came back the next
morning, morning of the resurrection.

428
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:07,533
But, of course, you know that.

429
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:09,911
Yeah, I know that.

430
00:40:09,953 --> 00:40:15,208
But the jar is kiln-fired so we can use
it for thermoluminescent dating.

431
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:19,087
All we have to do is find one other
piece that we know to be from 32 AD...

432
00:40:19,128 --> 00:40:21,339
and then we match
the glow curves.

433
00:40:21,422 --> 00:40:24,217
So, how can we do that?

434
00:40:24,259 --> 00:40:27,470
We find a piece that says,
"Dear Pontius Pilate...

435
00:40:27,554 --> 00:40:30,682
here are some cleansing oils
for washing off dirty hands."

436
00:40:30,765 --> 00:40:33,351
You're getting funnier and funnier.

437
00:40:33,434 --> 00:40:35,019
It's not a joke, actually.

438
00:40:35,103 --> 00:40:39,148
One call from Moshe Cohen to
the National Museum and it's done.

439
00:41:23,443 --> 00:41:26,654
Why won't they leave me alone?

440
00:41:26,738 --> 00:41:28,573
They took the jar.

441
00:41:28,656 --> 00:41:32,410
I know. I know who they are
and Cohen can help us get it back.

442
00:41:33,953 --> 00:41:35,872
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Are you hurt?

443
00:41:35,955 --> 00:41:37,874
It's just a scratch.

444
00:41:38,958 --> 00:41:40,418
Why did they attack us?

445
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:43,379
The Orthodox attack
any archaeological dig...

446
00:41:43,463 --> 00:41:46,090
where they think bodies
have been found.

447
00:42:06,486 --> 00:42:08,404
What's going on?

448
00:42:08,488 --> 00:42:10,990
They won't speak to me
because I'm a woman.

449
00:42:11,032 --> 00:42:14,744
Do they speak English? Do they speak
Spanish so I can communicate with them?

450
00:42:14,828 --> 00:42:17,038
We have to wait for Cohen.

451
00:42:19,707 --> 00:42:21,167
Are you okay, Father?

452
00:42:22,877 --> 00:42:25,088
We know the group.

453
00:42:25,171 --> 00:42:29,509
They're troublemakers.
Followers of the Reb Nechtal.

454
00:42:29,592 --> 00:42:32,720
Do you think they'll give it back?

455
00:42:32,804 --> 00:42:34,097
Who knows?

456
00:42:34,138 --> 00:42:37,934
Excuse me, sir.
Those men over there.

457
00:42:38,017 --> 00:42:40,145
They were supposed to be
guarding the tomb, correct?

458
00:42:41,271 --> 00:42:43,189
You two, back to the dig.

459
00:42:44,649 --> 00:42:46,568
Come with me.

460
00:42:49,487 --> 00:42:51,072
You wait here.

461
00:42:55,785 --> 00:42:57,662
You're bleeding again.

462
00:42:57,745 --> 00:42:59,664
I'm fine.

463
00:43:04,502 --> 00:43:06,796
We can go inside.
Will you wear this, Father?

464
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:29,778
Right.

465
00:43:31,112 --> 00:43:35,700
Ask him if Sharon
could be admitted...

466
00:43:35,784 --> 00:43:38,244
as our scientific authority.

467
00:43:39,329 --> 00:43:42,248
- Are you serious?
- As a heart attack.

468
00:44:19,786 --> 00:44:24,249
He says the law is the law.
They won't return the jar because...

469
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:26,584
we disturbed the dead.

470
00:44:27,669 --> 00:44:30,046
And according to the Talmud...

471
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:32,382
the dead are sacred.

472
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:43,685
Tell him the Talmud...

473
00:44:44,978 --> 00:44:47,564
is not an absolute instrument...

474
00:44:50,024 --> 00:44:53,319
but a subjective one
that needs man.

475
00:44:53,403 --> 00:44:55,280
That is what they teach.

476
00:44:56,865 --> 00:44:58,783
The Talmud needs man...

477
00:44:59,993 --> 00:45:02,912
as much man needs the Talmud.

478
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,917
Tell him.

479
00:45:08,001 --> 00:45:11,880
Look. These men live
by the Talmud.

480
00:45:11,963 --> 00:45:15,216
- I don't think you understand.
- Say it.

481
00:45:32,358 --> 00:45:33,777
Wait, wait, wait.

482
00:45:40,075 --> 00:45:41,534
What did he say?

483
00:45:41,618 --> 00:45:43,661
He says, the rabbi is right.

484
00:45:45,497 --> 00:45:47,082
Which rabbi?

485
00:45:48,124 --> 00:45:49,709
You.

486
00:46:00,178 --> 00:46:02,138
Reb Nechtal will return the jar.

487
00:46:03,348 --> 00:46:06,893
But the bones must remain in the tomb
until we can confirm...

488
00:46:06,976 --> 00:46:11,022
whether or not the deceased man
was a Gentile.

489
00:46:14,192 --> 00:46:17,237
Tell him that he has my word.

490
00:46:22,117 --> 00:46:25,787
That shoulder is bothering you.
Why can't we do something about it?

491
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:27,789
It's all right.

492
00:46:35,547 --> 00:46:38,800
Taking the jar is one thing.

493
00:46:38,883 --> 00:46:43,013
But as far as removing
the body is concerned...

494
00:46:43,096 --> 00:46:47,058
these guys would rather
eat pork than disturb the dead.

495
00:46:51,521 --> 00:46:53,106
Satisfied?

496
00:46:54,566 --> 00:46:58,862
Can we go now so you don't bleed
on the foor and contaminate my dig?

497
00:46:58,903 --> 00:47:02,032
Hey. Where's the lamp?

498
00:47:09,247 --> 00:47:11,541
Petty thieving.
Happens all the time.

499
00:47:11,624 --> 00:47:14,169
These are the conditions
I have to work under.

500
00:47:15,378 --> 00:47:18,465
Every link in the chain is relevant.

501
00:47:18,506 --> 00:47:20,884
There was lettering on the jar.

502
00:47:20,967 --> 00:47:23,428
Maybe there is something written
on the lamp too.

503
00:47:23,511 --> 00:47:26,806
You can try and buy it back on
the Via Dolorosa tomorrow if you like.

504
00:47:28,016 --> 00:47:30,644
You know what I just realized?

505
00:47:30,727 --> 00:47:34,564
That someone besides you, me
and Lavelle has seen the body.

506
00:47:34,648 --> 00:47:38,902
I know. I'm gonna take you inside
and do something with your shoulder.

507
00:47:38,985 --> 00:47:42,197
- I'll just take a taxi.
- Let me have a look at your shoulder.

508
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,909
- Am I gonna get some chicken soup?
- If you're lucky.

509
00:47:50,205 --> 00:47:53,833
- I'm so sorry we're so late.
- That's all right.

510
00:47:53,875 --> 00:47:56,670
You look exhausted.
Have my children been tiring you out?

511
00:47:56,711 --> 00:48:00,006
My children wore me out
long before yours. Don't worry.

512
00:48:01,424 --> 00:48:04,219
- And who are you?
- I am Matt Gutierrez.

513
00:48:04,302 --> 00:48:07,138
Gutierrez. Sephardic.

514
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:10,058
Sephardic Jesuit.
Matt's a priest from America.

515
00:48:10,141 --> 00:48:12,811
- You don't look like a priest.
- I know that.

516
00:48:12,852 --> 00:48:14,980
He knows that.

517
00:48:15,063 --> 00:48:18,191
Well, now I understand
those Jews for Jesus.

518
00:48:19,943 --> 00:48:23,280
- Good night. Thanks, Mrs. Kahn.
- See you tomorrow.

519
00:48:23,363 --> 00:48:25,198
- Nice meeting you.
- Same here.

520
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:31,955
Make yourself at home.
Go into the living room.

521
00:48:38,044 --> 00:48:42,465
Mrs. Kahn's a professional matchmaker.
Did she ask you for ID?

522
00:48:43,633 --> 00:48:46,636
No. She was satisfied
when I showed her my cross.

523
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,306
I understand
they work on vampires too.

524
00:48:58,857 --> 00:49:01,276
My husband, Yaron.

525
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:04,195
He was killed in Lebanon.

526
00:49:06,907 --> 00:49:08,199
I'm sorry.

527
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:14,247
You know, they can take care of this
at the monastery.

528
00:49:14,289 --> 00:49:17,542
So you keep saying.
Now go and sit down.

529
00:49:17,626 --> 00:49:18,752
You are stubborn.

530
00:49:21,463 --> 00:49:24,215
So, was he a professional soldier?

531
00:49:24,257 --> 00:49:28,053
No, he was a poet.
We met at university.

532
00:49:29,554 --> 00:49:34,351
He taught a very pretentious course
called Pushkin to Perestroika.

533
00:49:34,392 --> 00:49:37,020
I'm sorry. It must be hard
to talk about that.

534
00:49:37,103 --> 00:49:41,858
I found the most amazing pathologist
from London to study our body.

535
00:49:41,942 --> 00:49:44,361
Dr. Jonas Sproul.

536
00:49:45,528 --> 00:49:48,031
So, I understand that
only from the bones...

537
00:49:48,114 --> 00:49:50,033
they can determine what a person
did for a living...

538
00:49:50,116 --> 00:49:53,703
or what ethnic group
or how old he was--

539
00:49:53,787 --> 00:49:57,999
I thought you didn't know
anything about archaeology.

540
00:49:58,083 --> 00:50:01,962
Well, if it wasn't for
the Discovery Channel, I wouldn't.

541
00:50:04,965 --> 00:50:09,511
Those letters on the jar, do you have
a hard copy of them anywhere?

542
00:50:11,429 --> 00:50:14,224
Can I have one, please?

543
00:50:14,307 --> 00:50:16,851
What are you plotting?

544
00:50:16,935 --> 00:50:20,313
Come on. Humor me, okay?

545
00:50:22,482 --> 00:50:26,403
But if I'm gonna treat your shoulder,
I'm gonna need to see some skin.

546
00:50:27,654 --> 00:50:29,906
Come on. Think of me
as your sister.

547
00:50:31,408 --> 00:50:33,368
I don't see you as a nun,
actually.

548
00:50:34,327 --> 00:50:36,329
I am a confirmed widow.

549
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:52,012
What happened to your back?

550
00:50:53,388 --> 00:50:54,973
El Salvador.

551
00:50:57,225 --> 00:50:59,853
They were tough on priests?

552
00:50:59,895 --> 00:51:01,980
Tough on enemy soldiers.

553
00:51:02,856 --> 00:51:05,066
I was with military intelligence.

554
00:51:07,235 --> 00:51:09,237
Military intelligence had to fight?

555
00:51:11,198 --> 00:51:14,117
They don't have to fight.

556
00:51:14,201 --> 00:51:15,869
Just like poets.

557
00:51:19,873 --> 00:51:23,335
You have some blood
in your hair.

558
00:51:28,298 --> 00:51:29,341
Who's there?

559
00:51:30,091 --> 00:51:32,219
Go back to bed. Come on.

560
00:51:33,178 --> 00:51:36,097
I'm sorry. I should--

561
00:51:36,139 --> 00:51:38,725
You know, I should go too.

562
00:51:38,767 --> 00:51:41,228
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you anyway.

563
00:51:41,269 --> 00:51:42,854
Are you okay?

564
00:51:42,938 --> 00:51:47,818
Well, I missed the chicken soup,
but some other time.

565
00:51:47,901 --> 00:51:50,111
- Bye-bye, little one.
- Say good night, Dorene.

566
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:17,806
- Fr. Gutierrez, please.
- I'll get him for you.

567
00:52:17,848 --> 00:52:19,307
Thanks.

568
00:52:23,353 --> 00:52:25,397
- Yes?
- Dr. Golban's here.

569
00:52:26,273 --> 00:52:28,191
Coming right down.

570
00:52:38,285 --> 00:52:40,120
I'm sorry.

571
00:52:40,203 --> 00:52:42,122
I forgot you're a priest.
I'm sorry.

572
00:52:44,374 --> 00:52:46,126
Be right back.

573
00:52:50,547 --> 00:52:51,506
Sorry.

574
00:53:02,893 --> 00:53:05,979
It's the piece from the museum
dated 32 AD...

575
00:53:06,062 --> 00:53:07,898
the year Christ was crucified.

576
00:53:07,981 --> 00:53:10,692
So Moshe came through.

577
00:53:10,776 --> 00:53:13,612
How do we know this piece
has an exact date?

578
00:53:13,695 --> 00:53:15,947
It's a tributary jar,
a Caiaphas piece...

579
00:53:16,031 --> 00:53:19,659
and the lettering on it refers
to the earthquake of 32 AD.

580
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:23,038
And could the jar have been kept around
for 20 years and then used?

581
00:53:23,121 --> 00:53:27,542
Unlikely. It would be sacrilegious
to use an old jar in a temple offering.

582
00:53:27,584 --> 00:53:32,130
And here's the hard copy
of the lettering on the oil jar...

583
00:53:32,214 --> 00:53:34,341
you asked for, by the way.

584
00:53:38,303 --> 00:53:41,181
Nothing they don't need
to know, okay?

585
00:53:44,976 --> 00:53:47,312
It's a lovely piece.

586
00:53:47,395 --> 00:53:50,315
I've only seen one like it
in the National Museum.

587
00:53:50,357 --> 00:53:52,943
You say it's authenticated?

588
00:53:55,987 --> 00:53:58,407
All right, I'm going.

589
00:54:02,661 --> 00:54:04,788
Name of the dig, please?

590
00:54:06,331 --> 00:54:08,583
It's Dr. Golban's.
I don't know if I should.

591
00:54:08,667 --> 00:54:11,586
I have to identify the job
with some name...

592
00:54:11,628 --> 00:54:13,213
any name.

593
00:54:13,296 --> 00:54:15,841
I don't know.
Call it...

594
00:54:18,135 --> 00:54:20,303
Massada.

595
00:54:20,387 --> 00:54:24,015
They're running a spectograph on
the oil. Do you want to come and look?

596
00:54:24,057 --> 00:54:27,686
I would. I'd rather talk
to Hamid about the lamp.

597
00:54:27,769 --> 00:54:30,605
I don't think he's involved.
He's a good man.

598
00:54:30,689 --> 00:54:34,484
I know, but I have a hunch he might
know something about it.

599
00:54:35,861 --> 00:54:38,530
I'll pick you up afterwards.

600
00:54:45,579 --> 00:54:49,583
I'm sorry.
I wish I could help you.

601
00:54:49,666 --> 00:54:51,793
But as soon as you
and Dr. Golban ran out...

602
00:54:51,877 --> 00:54:55,672
I thought it would be safer if I closed
the shop for the day and went home.

603
00:54:55,756 --> 00:54:56,673
Why safer?

604
00:54:57,591 --> 00:55:00,761
I'm a Palestinian,
Mr. Gutierrez...

605
00:55:00,844 --> 00:55:03,680
with a shop near
an Orthodox neighborhood...

606
00:55:03,722 --> 00:55:06,975
where they stone people
for driving on the Sabbath.

607
00:55:10,687 --> 00:55:13,648
Yet alone disturbing their dead.

608
00:55:16,777 --> 00:55:19,154
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

609
00:55:19,196 --> 00:55:20,822
It's all right.

610
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:23,909
I'm very sorry.

611
00:55:23,992 --> 00:55:28,288
Listen to me. There is no reason
to be afraid of me.

612
00:55:29,247 --> 00:55:33,126
No one can punish you for something
you know nothing about.

613
00:55:57,234 --> 00:55:58,694
Keep moving.

614
00:56:04,408 --> 00:56:05,534
They've arrived.

615
00:56:09,621 --> 00:56:12,666
The chemical analysis of the oil
leaves us in no doubt.

616
00:56:12,749 --> 00:56:15,168
It was definitely used
for anointing.

617
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:18,338
And the carbon fourteen dating?

618
00:56:18,422 --> 00:56:22,259
The year 1, plus or minus 80.

619
00:56:22,342 --> 00:56:24,594
Same as the seeds
in the claywall.

620
00:56:49,661 --> 00:56:52,706
Here's a list
of the things I'll need.

621
00:57:29,368 --> 00:57:31,870
So, according to our measurements...

622
00:57:34,039 --> 00:57:36,708
this man was five foot five...

623
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:40,712
which is a good
five inches shorter.

624
00:57:40,754 --> 00:57:43,674
- Five inches shorter than what?
- The image of Christ...

625
00:57:43,715 --> 00:57:46,051
in the Holy Shroud of Turin.

626
00:57:48,262 --> 00:57:49,554
You're joking, right?

627
00:57:51,181 --> 00:57:53,350
- What?
- I said, you're joking, right?

628
00:57:53,433 --> 00:57:54,893
I am not.

629
00:57:57,229 --> 00:57:59,648
Congratulations, Father.

630
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:02,442
You came to prove something,
now you proved it.

631
00:58:02,484 --> 00:58:05,237
Pax vobiscum,
Sursum corda, whatever.

632
00:58:08,115 --> 00:58:09,866
Wait a second.

633
00:58:17,416 --> 00:58:19,334
Sharon, please.

634
00:58:19,418 --> 00:58:22,462
Wait, wait. Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

635
00:58:22,546 --> 00:58:25,340
Can we discuss this?
Just tell me what's on your mind.

636
00:58:25,382 --> 00:58:27,509
Go back to Rome.
I don't have time.

637
00:58:27,551 --> 00:58:30,887
That is not fair.
I came here for the truth, like you.

638
00:58:30,971 --> 00:58:32,097
So tell me.

639
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:36,560
The Turin Shroud is a proven fake,
so your supposition is ridiculous.

640
00:58:36,643 --> 00:58:38,937
Not even your Church
will take a position on it.

641
00:58:39,021 --> 00:58:42,107
And even if it would,
the image cannot be that of the Christ.

642
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:44,192
It could. It could be.

643
00:58:44,276 --> 00:58:46,320
That is enough to include it
in the investigation.

644
00:58:46,403 --> 00:58:48,739
- Read the Gospels, Father.
- Believe me, I have.

645
00:58:48,822 --> 00:58:50,741
Well, read them as a scientist,
not as a believer.

646
00:58:50,824 --> 00:58:53,827
As a scientist?
I am not a scientist. I am a priest.

647
00:58:53,911 --> 00:58:56,246
- I cannot fight your faith!
- I came here with a specific purpose.

648
00:58:56,288 --> 00:58:58,999
If you behave like a mystic,
go back to the Middle Ages...

649
00:58:59,082 --> 00:59:01,543
because I cannot do this
with you here.

650
00:59:12,179 --> 00:59:14,348
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

651
00:59:14,431 --> 00:59:15,682
Come here.

652
00:59:21,271 --> 00:59:22,231
The tomb.

653
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:53,345
Stop it! No! Don't!

654
00:59:57,474 --> 00:59:58,684
Don't shoot!

655
00:59:58,767 --> 01:00:01,061
No. In the name of God,
please don't shoot him!

656
01:00:01,144 --> 01:00:02,604
Don't shoot him!

657
01:00:05,607 --> 01:00:07,526
Thank you. Thank you.

658
01:01:05,542 --> 01:01:08,670
- Good morning, Father.
- Good morning.

659
01:01:08,754 --> 01:01:10,672
Any news?

660
01:01:12,591 --> 01:01:14,593
You all right?

661
01:01:14,676 --> 01:01:17,262
I have been better.

662
01:01:17,346 --> 01:01:21,934
Well, if you're talking about yesterday,
nobody's taking credit for anything.

663
01:01:22,017 --> 01:01:25,562
Which around these parts is like the
soccer player shagging a movie star...

664
01:01:25,646 --> 01:01:27,606
and not telling anyone
about it.

665
01:01:28,774 --> 01:01:30,067
Which means?

666
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:33,904
Which means, there's more to it
than meets the eye.

667
01:01:33,987 --> 01:01:35,906
Like this.

668
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:43,747
Look.

669
01:01:46,416 --> 01:01:48,377
Some sort of code?

670
01:01:48,418 --> 01:01:50,963
I don't know.
You're the expert.

671
01:01:53,257 --> 01:01:55,592
This is a very nice outfit.

672
01:01:55,676 --> 01:01:58,554
- Thank you, Father.
- I am impressed.

673
01:02:01,306 --> 01:02:05,769
When the Vatican recognizes an undivided
Jerusalem as the capital of Israel...

674
01:02:07,312 --> 01:02:09,356
the bones will be released.

675
01:02:13,861 --> 01:02:15,779
The poison spreads.

676
01:02:15,863 --> 01:02:18,657
Does the prime minister
know about this?

677
01:02:20,284 --> 01:02:23,579
But if he did,
he'd probably pin a medal on me.

678
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:25,747
Aren't you sticking
your neck out?

679
01:02:25,831 --> 01:02:30,377
A faint heart never won a battle, Avi.
Or a seat in the cabinet.

680
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:36,008
-Even if it means destroying a religion?
-Don't be an idiot.

681
01:02:36,049 --> 01:02:39,052
This won't be the end
of Christianity or the Catholic Church.

682
01:02:39,136 --> 01:02:41,555
- How can you know that?
- Look.

683
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:46,310
Religion is not based
on a rational system of proofs.

684
01:02:46,351 --> 01:02:49,438
It survives
because of human need.

685
01:02:49,521 --> 01:02:51,815
We offer proof
that Christ has not risen...

686
01:02:51,857 --> 01:02:55,819
those who believe
are not gonna believe us.

687
01:02:55,903 --> 01:02:58,447
Some may fall away,
but you know what?

688
01:02:59,615 --> 01:03:02,117
I think Christianity's
gonna survive.

689
01:03:05,329 --> 01:03:08,624
- What do you think?
- I don't think Cohen is bluffing.

690
01:03:08,707 --> 01:03:13,045
No. The body. Do you really
believe it is He in that tomb?

691
01:03:13,087 --> 01:03:15,672
I don't concern myself
with that very much.

692
01:03:15,756 --> 01:03:18,884
My concerns are for the Church
and her real problems.

693
01:03:36,443 --> 01:03:38,362
Matt, I don't understand...

694
01:03:38,445 --> 01:03:40,531
why it's such a disaster
for the Catholic Church...

695
01:03:40,614 --> 01:03:42,658
if these are
the bones of Christ.

696
01:03:42,741 --> 01:03:46,036
Isn't it enough
that He was an exceptional man...

697
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:48,914
who founded
an exceptional way of life...

698
01:03:48,997 --> 01:03:52,084
that's good and compassionate
and understanding?

699
01:03:52,167 --> 01:03:53,585
Right.

700
01:03:56,255 --> 01:04:00,884
The power of His message is love.
You're right with that.

701
01:04:00,968 --> 01:04:05,681
But at the same time
salvation and resurrection, He's God.

702
01:04:05,764 --> 01:04:09,518
He's not only God for me.
He's God for millions of people.

703
01:04:11,812 --> 01:04:14,231
You know,
when I left the army...

704
01:04:14,314 --> 01:04:18,277
I swore I would never again do a job
that could harm people.

705
01:04:19,445 --> 01:04:23,407
So I chose an archaeologist. That's
a pretty safe bet, you might think.

706
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:27,119
Now all of a sudden, I'm...

707
01:04:27,202 --> 01:04:30,831
being blamed for destroying
a world religion.

708
01:04:33,542 --> 01:04:35,961
If you take away
His resurrection...

709
01:04:37,755 --> 01:04:39,673
you kill the God Jesus...

710
01:04:41,008 --> 01:04:45,929
and with Him the dream of millions of
people who believe He's all they have.

711
01:04:45,971 --> 01:04:48,182
Are you manipulating me, Matt?

712
01:04:50,434 --> 01:04:53,270
Are you trying
to make me feel?

713
01:04:53,354 --> 01:04:56,732
But I wouldn't
call that manipulation. No.

714
01:04:56,815 --> 01:05:00,152
I don't want to feel responsible
for this. It's not my fault.

715
01:05:01,362 --> 01:05:03,280
What about the truth?

716
01:05:03,364 --> 01:05:05,282
Christ said the truth
will set you free.

717
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,285
The truth will set you free.

718
01:05:09,036 --> 01:05:12,831
You asked me
to see your truth...

719
01:05:12,873 --> 01:05:14,833
to think like a scientist.

720
01:05:16,877 --> 01:05:17,836
Now...

721
01:05:18,587 --> 01:05:22,299
I ask you
to experience my truth...

722
01:05:23,634 --> 01:05:25,594
to think with your heart.

723
01:05:28,263 --> 01:05:30,974
Can you do that for me?

724
01:05:34,978 --> 01:05:35,896
No, I can't.

725
01:05:53,205 --> 01:05:55,124
You don't know my truth.

726
01:05:56,542 --> 01:05:58,627
And I am afraid of it.

727
01:06:36,165 --> 01:06:38,667
All we can do is offer it up
to a higher power...

728
01:06:38,751 --> 01:06:42,338
and pray that in time
all will be revealed.

729
01:06:43,547 --> 01:06:45,507
Did you read that
in a fortune cookie?

730
01:06:45,549 --> 01:06:47,843
No. It's a proverb.

731
01:06:47,926 --> 01:06:51,430
In time, all that is hidden
will be revealed.

732
01:06:51,472 --> 01:06:54,642
It's the Bible. It's a big book,
but it's a crackin' read.

733
01:06:56,352 --> 01:06:58,646
Mr. Hamid is waiting for you
on the veranda.

734
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:01,398
He says it's very important.

735
01:07:01,482 --> 01:07:02,900
Hamid?

736
01:07:17,122 --> 01:07:18,582
Here?

737
01:07:23,837 --> 01:07:27,299
I cannot believe
that you were able to find it.

738
01:07:27,383 --> 01:07:32,680
Jerusalem is small. For every oil lamp
a thief and for every thief a buyer.

739
01:07:32,763 --> 01:07:34,223
Please.

740
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,610
And you expect me to believe you,
a known terrorist?

741
01:07:46,694 --> 01:07:49,655
I do not expect you
to believe me.

742
01:07:49,738 --> 01:07:52,992
But I do expect you
to believe your ears.

743
01:07:57,162 --> 01:08:02,668
When the Vatican recognizes an undivided
Jerusalem as the capital of Israel...

744
01:08:02,751 --> 01:08:04,712
the bones will be released.

745
01:08:04,795 --> 01:08:06,714
That's immaterial.

746
01:08:08,757 --> 01:08:10,009
On the contrary.

747
01:08:11,010 --> 01:08:14,305
If Cohen succeeds
in this blackmail...

748
01:08:15,681 --> 01:08:17,683
there will be a bloodbath.

749
01:08:17,725 --> 01:08:19,810
With you at the spigot.

750
01:08:28,777 --> 01:08:31,947
I didn't invite you here
to exchange insults.

751
01:08:31,989 --> 01:08:35,826
In fact,
you didn't invite me here.

752
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:38,329
You lured me here
under false pretenses.

753
01:08:38,412 --> 01:08:41,874
I brought you here
to provide us both a way out.

754
01:08:43,792 --> 01:08:45,836
Remove the body
from the tomb...

755
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:49,506
and I will help you get it
to your embassy in Syria.

756
01:08:49,590 --> 01:08:53,677
So you can blackmail the Vatican,
like Moshe Cohen?

757
01:08:57,014 --> 01:08:58,015
Mr. Yusef...

758
01:08:59,183 --> 01:09:03,604
I believe God
has no place in politics.

759
01:09:03,687 --> 01:09:06,023
Mine, yours.

760
01:09:06,065 --> 01:09:08,025
That's what I believe.

761
01:09:09,902 --> 01:09:13,697
Then the blood will be
on your hands, not on mine.

762
01:09:13,781 --> 01:09:16,367
Even you don't believe that.

763
01:09:26,877 --> 01:09:28,796
I believe this is yours.

764
01:10:23,309 --> 01:10:26,520
So you got a special body
that you want me to examine.

765
01:10:26,604 --> 01:10:29,231
500 BC. Is that correct?

766
01:10:29,273 --> 01:10:32,651
- What makes you think it's special?
- That.

767
01:10:32,735 --> 01:10:35,779
- There was a terrorist attack.
- No, what makes the body interesting...

768
01:10:35,863 --> 01:10:39,033
is the fact
that it was crucified.

769
01:10:39,074 --> 01:10:42,244
Did the Babylonians crucify?
I think not, Sharon, no.

770
01:10:42,328 --> 01:10:45,122
Twenty-five hundred years
is a long way down.

771
01:10:45,206 --> 01:10:49,335
Now, I prefer
to examine bodies in a lab.

772
01:10:49,376 --> 01:10:53,547
The darkness of a tomb
breeds fights of imagination.

773
01:10:53,631 --> 01:10:56,467
So, shall we have a look
at your fellow?

774
01:10:59,386 --> 01:11:02,640
What are you
so nervous about?

775
01:11:02,723 --> 01:11:06,018
I told him
the body was 500 BC.

776
01:11:08,395 --> 01:11:11,023
I lied for you.

777
01:11:17,279 --> 01:11:20,032
Now, this is unusual.
Minor indentations...

778
01:11:20,074 --> 01:11:23,202
from the coronal suture...

779
01:11:23,244 --> 01:11:25,204
along the frontal.

780
01:11:25,246 --> 01:11:29,834
Now, the skin was pierced
with something right to the skull...

781
01:11:29,875 --> 01:11:33,295
pointed objects of some kind,
but not--yes, not metal.

782
01:11:33,379 --> 01:11:34,713
There's no oxidation.

783
01:11:34,797 --> 01:11:37,800
All the way along
to the supraorbital notch.

784
01:11:39,552 --> 01:11:43,973
Our fellow
was obviously male, yes, and...

785
01:11:45,224 --> 01:11:46,976
certainly crucified.

786
01:11:47,935 --> 01:11:52,648
But I'm not sure about this date,
500 BC. It appears Roman.

787
01:11:53,607 --> 01:11:57,570
- Why?
- If you see this mark on the ribs...

788
01:11:57,611 --> 01:12:00,239
looks like they finished him off
with a round spear.

789
01:12:00,281 --> 01:12:02,533
Build-up of right forearm.

790
01:12:02,616 --> 01:12:07,079
A mason. A carpenter.
Just like Christ.

791
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:12,460
Shall we continue
this conversation outside?

792
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:38,254
Father, we've got to talk.

793
01:13:39,296 --> 01:13:42,258
Yes, fine, good.

794
01:13:42,299 --> 01:13:44,677
I have found something.

795
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:50,224
Daniel 7 and 8, about the coming
of the Antichrist in the 70th week.

796
01:13:50,307 --> 01:13:53,352
- No, please, Father.
- Which is not a week, but years.

797
01:13:53,394 --> 01:13:55,396
This is serious stuff.

798
01:13:55,438 --> 01:13:58,399
Thousands.
And exactly correlates...

799
01:13:58,482 --> 01:14:01,235
with Nostradamus
and Revelations.

800
01:14:01,318 --> 01:14:03,904
Dr. Sproul said to me
that the body had--

801
01:14:03,988 --> 01:14:06,657
Exactly. The body.

802
01:14:06,741 --> 01:14:11,162
See? Mark 18, verse 21 .

803
01:14:11,245 --> 01:14:13,831
And if any man
shall say unto you...

804
01:14:13,914 --> 01:14:18,711
here, lo is Christ
or lo, He is there, believe him not.

805
01:14:18,794 --> 01:14:20,838
- Please, Father.
- Daniel predicted...

806
01:14:20,921 --> 01:14:24,133
that the false prophet would come
as a man like you or I.

807
01:14:24,216 --> 01:14:27,511
But he was wrong.
It is the body.

808
01:14:27,595 --> 01:14:31,766
Dr. Sproul found scratches on the
rib cage from the legionnaire's spear.

809
01:14:31,849 --> 01:14:33,392
- Irrelevant.
- Irrelevant?

810
01:14:33,476 --> 01:14:36,562
He knew his age, that he was
a carpenter. That is not irrelevant.

811
01:14:36,645 --> 01:14:39,315
But you're not listening.
It doesn't matter what he said.

812
01:14:39,398 --> 01:14:42,276
He has no authority
in matters of the faith.

813
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:46,238
- But I thought you were a scientist.
- I am.

814
01:14:46,322 --> 01:14:50,159
- In the service of God.
- For heaven's sake, put God aside...

815
01:14:50,201 --> 01:14:52,203
and let me talk
to the scientist.

816
01:14:52,286 --> 01:14:53,996
Please tell me!

817
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:57,792
Give me something we can use,
something we can hold on to.

818
01:14:57,875 --> 01:15:01,671
But I already have.
Mark 13, verse 21 .

819
01:15:01,754 --> 01:15:05,174
The body in the tomb
is the false prophet.

820
01:15:05,257 --> 01:15:08,427
You accept him
and you summon the Antichrist.

821
01:15:08,511 --> 01:15:11,097
What about the crown
of thorns, Father?

822
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:13,641
- What do you mean, crown of thorns?
- Yes.

823
01:15:13,683 --> 01:15:17,812
The one that pierced the forehead
of a carpenter in his mid-'30s.

824
01:15:20,564 --> 01:15:25,820
With unbroken legs, oxidation marks
on the wrist and feet and a heart wound.

825
01:15:25,903 --> 01:15:29,031
What do we do about that?
What do I do, Father?

826
01:15:29,073 --> 01:15:32,535
Yes, yes.
I-- I see your point.

827
01:15:35,663 --> 01:15:37,081
Please...

828
01:15:38,499 --> 01:15:41,377
give me a few moments alone.

829
01:15:50,344 --> 01:15:52,847
Of course.

830
01:15:52,930 --> 01:15:55,141
I'm sorry. Of course.

831
01:18:11,027 --> 01:18:13,821
What are you doing here?
What happened?

832
01:18:14,697 --> 01:18:17,074
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

833
01:18:19,619 --> 01:18:21,537
Fr. Lavelle is dead.

834
01:18:24,457 --> 01:18:26,375
He killed himself.

835
01:18:28,586 --> 01:18:32,173
And he did that
after I told him about...

836
01:18:32,256 --> 01:18:34,175
Dr. Sproul's findings.

837
01:18:40,556 --> 01:18:42,475
I'm sorry.

838
01:18:46,562 --> 01:18:48,606
Shit.

839
01:18:48,689 --> 01:18:50,858
I can't...

840
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:53,319
do God's work anymore.

841
01:19:06,582 --> 01:19:09,210
When I was 14 years old...

842
01:19:11,337 --> 01:19:14,423
I had a rife
hanging on my shoulder.

843
01:19:14,507 --> 01:19:17,885
No hopes,
no future, no nothing.

844
01:19:19,971 --> 01:19:24,100
There was this man,
this priest...

845
01:19:24,183 --> 01:19:28,229
called Manuel Arrerra.

846
01:19:28,312 --> 01:19:32,233
He was one
of those liberation priests...

847
01:19:32,275 --> 01:19:34,485
revolutionaries of God.

848
01:19:36,237 --> 01:19:39,574
In some way
he was a father to me.

849
01:19:39,657 --> 01:19:41,576
One day...

850
01:19:42,869 --> 01:19:47,498
I was standing in the middle of the
church, and he came up to me and said...

851
01:19:48,624 --> 01:19:53,004
"You would be
a great soldier of Christ."

852
01:19:56,632 --> 01:20:00,428
And I believed him.
It became my ambition.

853
01:20:01,762 --> 01:20:03,848
My country was
in the middle of a war...

854
01:20:03,931 --> 01:20:06,392
and he was working
for the guerillas, and...

855
01:20:07,351 --> 01:20:09,979
he convinced me that...

856
01:20:11,689 --> 01:20:15,193
the best way
I could help our cause was...

857
01:20:16,486 --> 01:20:18,571
working undercover...

858
01:20:18,654 --> 01:20:21,032
for military intelligence.

859
01:20:21,073 --> 01:20:24,952
On the 14th of June, 1981 ...

860
01:20:25,036 --> 01:20:28,080
I made a terrible mistake.

861
01:20:28,164 --> 01:20:31,459
My most reliable source...

862
01:20:33,586 --> 01:20:38,591
gave me information
I absolutely believed to be true.

863
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:43,805
I passed it to...

864
01:20:43,846 --> 01:20:46,224
Fr. Manuel.

865
01:20:49,435 --> 01:20:52,647
And I sent him to his death.

866
01:20:53,731 --> 01:20:55,983
These two deaths
are unrelated.

867
01:20:57,110 --> 01:21:00,446
And neither of them
was your fault.

868
01:21:00,530 --> 01:21:04,325
They were my family.
They are my family. That's...

869
01:21:04,408 --> 01:21:06,327
all I have.

870
01:21:10,373 --> 01:21:14,460
If that-- If that is
the body of Jesus Christ...

871
01:21:17,630 --> 01:21:21,759
I sent Fr. Lavelle to oblivion,
to nothingness.

872
01:21:28,015 --> 01:21:30,810
I need to know
if that body there...

873
01:21:32,937 --> 01:21:34,856
is Him.

874
01:23:05,405 --> 01:23:07,323
Can you get that?

875
01:23:18,418 --> 01:23:20,336
Galit, from the lab.

876
01:23:22,547 --> 01:23:25,550
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Could you repeat that?

877
01:23:28,469 --> 01:23:31,139
Are you sure?

878
01:23:31,222 --> 01:23:33,141
No doubt?

879
01:23:36,269 --> 01:23:38,229
Thank you.

880
01:23:38,312 --> 01:23:40,356
God bless you. Bye.

881
01:23:42,066 --> 01:23:45,278
- What did she say?
- It is not Him.

882
01:23:45,361 --> 01:23:47,280
It's not Christ.

883
01:23:47,363 --> 01:23:49,157
70 CE.

884
01:23:51,034 --> 01:23:54,620
- Something about a perfect glow.
- Great.

885
01:23:56,372 --> 01:24:00,001
I gotta go. I gotta go.

886
01:24:00,043 --> 01:24:02,503
I have to write the report
and fax it right away to Rome.

887
01:24:02,545 --> 01:24:04,505
- Okay, let's go.
- Wait.

888
01:24:06,799 --> 01:24:09,344
I'm sorry.

889
01:24:09,427 --> 01:24:13,598
- I am sorry. I'm such an idiot.
- I don't understand.

890
01:24:13,639 --> 01:24:17,644
This was your big discovery.
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry.

891
01:24:17,727 --> 01:24:19,646
I'm happy, you're happy.

892
01:24:19,729 --> 01:24:22,982
And I'm not gonna burn in hell,
so let's go. Come on.

893
01:24:24,942 --> 01:24:27,904
Jacket, keys. Jacket.

894
01:24:27,945 --> 01:24:30,114
- Your jacket.
- Oh, yes. Yes.

895
01:24:40,667 --> 01:24:43,127
All the cross-checks
and duplications are there.

896
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:45,964
Thought it was
quite straight forward.

897
01:24:46,005 --> 01:24:49,717
I just don't follow how you managed
to establish a precise date...

898
01:24:49,801 --> 01:24:52,136
based solely
on the glow curves.

899
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:55,848
We didn't. We still have
to match it to a known date.

900
01:24:56,599 --> 01:24:59,769
Then how did you get 70 CE...

901
01:24:59,811 --> 01:25:02,397
from a piece that's 32 CE?

902
01:25:02,438 --> 01:25:04,482
You didn't say 32 CE.

903
01:25:06,567 --> 01:25:08,861
- I didn't say anything.
- Yes, you did.

904
01:25:08,945 --> 01:25:12,073
You did. You said Massada.
You did!

905
01:25:12,115 --> 01:25:15,410
I only said Massada
as a name for a file.

906
01:25:15,493 --> 01:25:17,870
I didn't give you the date.

907
01:25:18,913 --> 01:25:20,832
I didn't.

908
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:24,127
All right.

909
01:25:24,210 --> 01:25:27,338
Was the date
of the matching piece 32 CE?

910
01:25:31,801 --> 01:25:33,136
Yes.

911
01:25:34,387 --> 01:25:37,849
Then your date is 32 CE.
It's a perfect match.

912
01:25:47,859 --> 01:25:51,571
Father, a message has come through for
you on the Net. Cardinal Pesci's office.

913
01:25:53,281 --> 01:25:55,617
Hello, Father. It's urgent.

914
01:25:58,036 --> 01:26:00,788
- Can you read it to me?
- It's marked for your eyes only.

915
01:26:00,872 --> 01:26:04,918
What's it say? And don't go through
the motion of opening the envelope.

916
01:26:05,001 --> 01:26:07,712
- I know you did it already.
- I may have caught a peek.

917
01:26:07,754 --> 01:26:09,714
It goes something
along the lines of...

918
01:26:09,797 --> 01:26:11,758
"Cardinal Pesci
and Moshe have spoken.

919
01:26:11,841 --> 01:26:15,178
And they concur that it's time
for you to bring your friend to Rome."

920
01:26:15,219 --> 01:26:17,388
I booked you a fight
for tomorrow morning.

921
01:26:17,472 --> 01:26:22,143
- Shall I tell Dr. Golban?
- No, no. I'll do it myself.

922
01:26:22,185 --> 01:26:23,853
And, Father...

923
01:26:23,937 --> 01:26:26,814
I'm sorry about not being able
to crack that code of yours.

924
01:26:27,607 --> 01:26:29,692
It's all right.

925
01:26:29,776 --> 01:26:32,237
It's not important anymore.
Thanks.

926
01:26:34,864 --> 01:26:36,532
Hello, Abu Yusef.

927
01:26:36,616 --> 01:26:39,577
They said the body was Christ.

928
01:26:39,619 --> 01:26:41,579
He said Christ?

929
01:26:43,539 --> 01:26:48,002
If that's what they think,
Rome will do anything to get it back.

930
01:26:48,086 --> 01:26:50,546
We must act immediately.

931
01:27:32,463 --> 01:27:34,632
- Stop.
- What's wrong?

932
01:27:34,716 --> 01:27:37,218
I forgot to say good-bye
to the Easter Bunny.

933
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:45,059
Don't tell me.

934
01:27:45,143 --> 01:27:49,189
The Red Queen has invited you
to her birthday party.

935
01:27:49,272 --> 01:27:53,484
Not exactly. You were right. It was
a prayer. The bloody code of yours.

936
01:27:53,526 --> 01:27:56,779
- We have a plane to catch.
- Excuse me. How is that?

937
01:27:56,863 --> 01:28:01,326
I ran a program to search for keywords
like "please," " Father," "God," "Amen."

938
01:28:01,409 --> 01:28:03,494
- And they all came up?
- No, not exactly.

939
01:28:03,536 --> 01:28:06,414
But two and three-quarters.
" Please" and " Father."

940
01:28:06,497 --> 01:28:08,458
And then three letters
from the word "God."

941
01:28:08,499 --> 01:28:10,668
Which means
our man is a Jew.

942
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:14,464
A Jew will not write out the full word
"God" on anything that may be destroyed.

943
01:28:14,547 --> 01:28:16,925
Could even be
a follower of Christ.

944
01:28:16,966 --> 01:28:19,469
- In the wall.
- What is this about?

945
01:28:19,552 --> 01:28:22,430
There is a prayer in the tomb.

946
01:28:22,472 --> 01:28:25,141
- What letter's missing?
- Fav.

947
01:28:25,225 --> 01:28:26,893
- The dig is over.
- Hold on.

948
01:28:33,483 --> 01:28:35,902
- Take a look.
- Bingo.

949
01:28:35,985 --> 01:28:39,781
- The oil lamp from the dig.
- It's got to be in the tomb.

950
01:28:39,864 --> 01:28:42,200
I have to find Sharon.
Let's go.

951
01:28:59,676 --> 01:29:03,763
- Excuse me. Dr. Golban?
- Hamid. Is everything all right?

952
01:29:03,805 --> 01:29:05,765
I don't know.
It's Mr. Gutierrez.

953
01:29:05,807 --> 01:29:08,309
He took a pick from the store
and disappeared into the tomb.

954
01:29:08,393 --> 01:29:12,188
He seemed very disturbed.
I thought you would want to know.

955
01:29:13,189 --> 01:29:15,191
Yes. Yes. Let's go.

956
01:29:23,283 --> 01:29:25,243
The van is over here.

957
01:29:25,285 --> 01:29:27,537
It's okay, Hamid.
I'll take my car.

958
01:29:30,039 --> 01:29:32,167
What's going on?

959
01:29:32,208 --> 01:29:34,961
Hamid, why didn't
you just call me?

960
01:29:35,044 --> 01:29:36,963
Hamid, what's going on?

961
01:29:48,016 --> 01:29:52,896
We mean you no harm. Unless you do what
I say, the children will be executed.

962
01:29:52,979 --> 01:29:54,981
They want what's in the tomb.

963
01:30:13,458 --> 01:30:15,376
Can you hear me?

964
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:17,587
Message for Fr. Gutierrez.

965
01:30:17,670 --> 01:30:19,672
Dr. Golban--

966
01:30:19,756 --> 01:30:22,300
I can't hear you.
Talk slower. You're breaking up.

967
01:30:22,383 --> 01:30:25,345
They've taken the children.

968
01:30:25,428 --> 01:30:27,597
It's only a body.

969
01:30:29,015 --> 01:30:32,477
- They're only bones.
- Father! Father!

970
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,979
Dr. Golban just called.
She's freaking out.

971
01:30:35,021 --> 01:30:37,107
- Her kids have been kidnapped.
- What?

972
01:30:37,190 --> 01:30:39,150
The line was bad,
but I'm sure she said bones.

973
01:30:39,192 --> 01:30:41,111
- Give me your car keys.
-Just bones.

974
01:30:41,194 --> 01:30:43,822
Call Moshe Cohen
and tell him exactly what Sharon said.

975
01:30:43,905 --> 01:30:45,573
- What's happening?
- Call him.

976
01:32:23,213 --> 01:32:26,091
The body is missing. Yes.

977
01:32:54,119 --> 01:32:56,496
The red car!
Follow the red car!

978
01:33:09,884 --> 01:33:12,095
Why do you stare like that?

979
01:33:12,178 --> 01:33:15,223
They would have killed my family
if I didn't cooperate.

980
01:33:15,306 --> 01:33:19,269
And my family's disposable
just because we're Israeli?

981
01:33:19,352 --> 01:33:22,063
Of course not.

982
01:33:22,105 --> 01:33:25,400
But it's of no consequence,
as no one will be killed.

983
01:33:25,442 --> 01:33:28,153
So you say.

984
01:33:28,236 --> 01:33:30,322
I swear it.

985
01:33:30,405 --> 01:33:32,741
On my life.

986
01:34:11,196 --> 01:34:13,865
Everything will be fine now.
You will see.

987
01:34:23,208 --> 01:34:25,126
This is Abu Yusef.

988
01:34:26,878 --> 01:34:28,338
Where are my children?

989
01:34:28,380 --> 01:34:31,132
So you are the one
who started all the trouble.

990
01:34:57,033 --> 01:35:01,079
Now you have what you want, so she
will have the car to take the children.

991
01:35:06,501 --> 01:35:09,337
You gave me your word.
The children will be released.

992
01:35:12,382 --> 01:35:15,260
Children, run inside.
Go away. Run in.

993
01:35:15,969 --> 01:35:21,391
You can't kill the children.
I swore my life! I won't have it!

994
01:35:35,447 --> 01:35:36,865
What have you done?

995
01:35:53,590 --> 01:35:54,966
- You okay?
- Yeah.

996
01:36:07,103 --> 01:36:09,731
- The bones. He went that way.
- Where? Where?

997
01:36:09,814 --> 01:36:11,775
He went up the stairs.

998
01:36:35,757 --> 01:36:37,175
Look after them.

999
01:36:58,530 --> 01:37:02,033
- I may hit the priest.
- If Yusef makes it out, he's in Syria.

1000
01:37:06,204 --> 01:37:08,164
Give it up.

1001
01:37:18,425 --> 01:37:20,302
As you said...

1002
01:37:21,178 --> 01:37:23,263
God...

1003
01:37:23,346 --> 01:37:26,266
has no place in politics.

1004
01:37:29,686 --> 01:37:31,188
Not mine.

1005
01:37:35,442 --> 01:37:36,693
Not yours.

1006
01:38:10,602 --> 01:38:14,064
The Cardinal wants
this incident buried.

1007
01:38:19,444 --> 01:38:21,530
To have the state of Israel
involved in something...

1008
01:38:21,571 --> 01:38:24,783
so potentially dangerous
to the Christian faith...

1009
01:38:24,866 --> 01:38:27,327
would have serious
repercussions for us.

1010
01:38:27,410 --> 01:38:30,247
This is not
the body of Christ.

1011
01:38:30,330 --> 01:38:32,958
When the Vatican recognizes
an undivided Jerusalem...

1012
01:38:33,041 --> 01:38:37,504
as the capital of Israel,
the bones will be released.

1013
01:38:37,546 --> 01:38:41,258
God has no place in politics.

1014
01:38:41,341 --> 01:38:44,761
Christ said the truth
will set you free.

1015
01:38:46,471 --> 01:38:48,682
The truth will set you free.

1016
01:40:16,853 --> 01:40:19,439
What's this doing
in the house?

1017
01:40:19,523 --> 01:40:22,859
Well, it belongs
to my friend Matt.

1018
01:40:22,943 --> 01:40:24,194
But it's a cross.

1019
01:40:24,277 --> 01:40:27,781
Well, you see Matt is a Christian,
and he wears a cross...

1020
01:40:27,823 --> 01:40:30,450
like you wear
your daddy's Magen David.

1021
01:40:30,492 --> 01:40:32,744
But there's this man
on the cross.

1022
01:40:32,786 --> 01:40:36,081
- And who do you think that might be?
- I don't know.

1023
01:40:37,624 --> 01:40:41,837
What would you say if I told you
that that was their god?

1024
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:45,715
They can see their god.
Wow. They're lucky.

1025
01:40:48,385 --> 01:40:52,723
Do you think it matters
that we can't see our god?

1026
01:40:54,850 --> 01:40:58,937
Don't be sad, Mommy.
Daddy can see God.

1027
01:41:00,313 --> 01:41:02,232
Do you think he can?

1028
01:41:04,985 --> 01:41:06,903
I think he can too.

1029
01:41:12,784 --> 01:41:16,246
We're very pleased that your
recuperation is going so well.

1030
01:41:16,288 --> 01:41:18,623
Is there anything
we can do for you?

1031
01:41:18,707 --> 01:41:20,625
Yes, Your Eminence.

1032
01:41:21,793 --> 01:41:24,004
I would like you
to listen to me.

1033
01:41:25,672 --> 01:41:27,632
Of course, Father.
Of course.

1034
01:41:29,676 --> 01:41:33,305
Your Eminence,
when I was chosen to go to Jerusalem...

1035
01:41:34,056 --> 01:41:36,224
I asked you why.

1036
01:41:36,266 --> 01:41:38,852
Why me?

1037
01:41:38,894 --> 01:41:41,938
Why not an archaeologist?
Someone more...

1038
01:41:42,814 --> 01:41:45,442
qualified for the task.

1039
01:41:46,693 --> 01:41:50,781
And when you told me
it was because of my faith...

1040
01:41:50,864 --> 01:41:52,115
I believed you.

1041
01:41:55,494 --> 01:41:57,496
Because for me...

1042
01:41:57,579 --> 01:42:00,582
your word was as good as...

1043
01:42:00,665 --> 01:42:02,459
God's.

1044
01:42:05,379 --> 01:42:07,964
But now, Your Eminence --

1045
01:42:08,048 --> 01:42:11,301
now I know the real truth.

1046
01:42:13,011 --> 01:42:17,349
You needed a puppet
to do your bidding.

1047
01:42:17,432 --> 01:42:21,687
The body is not Christ,
you said.

1048
01:42:21,770 --> 01:42:23,855
And that is exactly
what I went to prove.

1049
01:42:23,939 --> 01:42:27,192
Whether it was true or not.

1050
01:42:27,275 --> 01:42:31,196
No matter how many innocent lives
it cost in the process.

1051
01:42:32,322 --> 01:42:35,617
I know you don't
believe this, Father.

1052
01:42:35,701 --> 01:42:40,163
But in time you will come to see
it was not Him in that tomb.

1053
01:42:40,247 --> 01:42:43,834
Of course.
I already know that.

1054
01:42:45,752 --> 01:42:50,090
I thought I had lost my faith
in Christ, in God.

1055
01:42:51,675 --> 01:42:53,802
My savior.

1056
01:42:53,885 --> 01:42:56,805
My...

1057
01:42:56,888 --> 01:42:59,349
friend.

1058
01:42:59,433 --> 01:43:01,351
But I hadn't.

1059
01:43:02,936 --> 01:43:06,356
I have lost my faith
in serving men...

1060
01:43:06,440 --> 01:43:08,984
like you or Moshe Cohen...

1061
01:43:09,067 --> 01:43:13,196
who use God to justify
their material agendas.

1062
01:43:14,323 --> 01:43:19,286
That is why I now choose
to serve God in my own personal way.

1063
01:43:32,049 --> 01:43:34,009
As a priest,
you are sworn to silence.

1064
01:43:37,179 --> 01:43:39,139
Fr. Gutierrez?

1065
01:43:58,033 --> 01:43:59,952
Remember, Sharon...

1066
01:44:00,035 --> 01:44:02,663
how you said
the truth would set me free?

1067
01:44:03,455 --> 01:44:06,708
Well, it has.

1068
01:44:06,792 --> 01:44:09,294
The Church made me a priest...

1069
01:44:09,378 --> 01:44:14,174
but it was our ordeal together
that has made me a man of God.

1070
01:44:14,216 --> 01:44:17,177
Maybe for the first time.

1071
01:44:17,219 --> 01:44:20,013
Wherever I go,
I will keep you in my heart...

1072
01:44:20,097 --> 01:44:22,766
and also in my prayers.

1073
01:44:22,891 --> 01:44:25,227
God keep you and bless you.
