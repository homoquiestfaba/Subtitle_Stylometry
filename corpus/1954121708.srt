00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,599
Tomo por mientras lo no enseñado...

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,199

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,199
para mañana se cuidara...

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,399
de las cosas de si mismo...

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,999
el dia final será su demonio  .

Matthew 6:34

7
00:03:03,955 --> 00:03:06,067
Carl to say something...

8
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,728
Let me ask you something first:

9
00:03:07,738 --> 00:03:09,531
They describe me as a B?

10
00:03:09,531 --> 00:03:11,114
Well, I think that.

11
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,989
You know what?

12
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,145
Carl we are 800 lbs gorilla.

13
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:17,464
We sell the starter.

14
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:18,983
What do they do?

15
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,502
The bluff is Carl.

16
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:23,999
Even Lucy does not think so.

17
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:25,649
Hold my wife calling.

18
00:03:25,854 --> 00:03:28,999
Hi honey, I'm late today.

19
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,906
I'm with Carl...

20
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,236
Did they?

21
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:36,249
We take her home,
that will be better.

22
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,271
They will never want to leave.

23
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,449
Hey Gab, I switch now, okay?

24
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,541
I love you.

25
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:43,342
Carl it is so, listen...

26
00:03:43,352 --> 00:03:44,529
I'm brand new.

27
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:45,999
I have a formula.

28
00:03:46,013 --> 00:03:48,945
Change the formula
and lose your listeners.

29
00:03:49,055 --> 00:03:50,467
It is as simple as that.

30
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:52,188
People listen to who I am...

31
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:53,190
and what I say...

32
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:56,268
and nobody wants to listen to a
man 's hair ball in his mouth.

33
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:58,269
This is radio.

34
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,974
If you want to talk, call your
and talk about it.

35
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,399
And can you explain
anyone who listens...

36
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,070
you 't likes that
The FCC thus you slijmt.

37
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,999
You can 't just say.

38
00:04:08,132 --> 00:04:09,434
Bye.

39
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:12,344
Hurry up friend.

40
00:04:12,354 --> 00:04:13,356
You owe me five.

41
00:04:14,356 --> 00:04:15,947
Did they now
put on the payroll?

42
00:04:15,957 --> 00:04:17,946
I swear Lucy succeed everywhere.

43
00:04:24,456 --> 00:04:27,499
Logan. Hey.
Nice that you visit.

44
00:04:27,606 --> 00:04:29,607
I thought Gil
it would take you?

45
00:04:29,881 --> 00:04:31,502
Not as long as I live.

46
00:04:32,156 --> 00:04:33,582
What about with you Max...

47
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,001

48
00:04:35,043 --> 00:04:37,045
Logan Well I do not know?

49
00:04:37,055 --> 00:04:39,069
I was planning
go to sleep tonight...

50
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,590
to ignore what tomorrow
weather will bring.

51
00:04:41,592 --> 00:04:42,924
Ignore 's division.

52
00:04:43,004 --> 00:04:44,216
Hi Doc.

53
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:47,690
Maggie, hold the door against?

54
00:04:52,594 --> 00:04:54,578
I'm not late.
Do not say that.

55
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:09,492
Greetings from the powerful.

56
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:11,001
I'm your host Logan Heart Burn.

57
00:05:11,101 --> 00:05:14,536
The man with all the answers

58
00:05:14,646 --> 00:05:16,439
The reason why
at night awake.

59
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,151
The personality
you can not resist.

60
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,226
The psychiatrist
you can not afford.

61
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,820
Welcome to Harper.

62
00:05:21,996 --> 00:05:23,055
Burns talked about...

63
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,325
I am accompanied
employed by your favorite...

64
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:28,777
Gilbert dibs Brickman.

65
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:33,966
You are much too kind.

66
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:35,359
How do you feel tonight,
Gilman?

67
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:38,140
I'm ready to buy
and to work with.

68
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,632
It is not about your sex life,
This is my show.

69
00:05:40,642 --> 00:05:41,799
All lines are open.
Ready for action.

70
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,933
How do you feel private?

71
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:45,135
I feel its a little...

72
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:46,997
paranoid my friend.

73
00:05:47,248 --> 00:05:49,289
You know?
It stinks here...

74
00:05:49,299 --> 00:05:51,550
So you must hate mail
read again.

75
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,617
No, probably about my
ex without stamps.

76
00:05:54,727 --> 00:05:57,793
It is something else, something that
troubling since my childhood.

77
00:05:57,893 --> 00:05:59,949
And why 't get in me
comes up is...

78
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,052
because I was certain
in traffic and I...

79
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:05,162
I did not prepare
for the evening show.

80
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:09,326
It looks
that evening full of...

81
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:10,862
encourage and abet.

82
00:06:10,962 --> 00:06:13,079
And that high entertainment
makes us...

83
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:15,804
The number one
most listened show...

84
00:06:15,804 --> 00:06:16,807
in the pus.

85
00:06:16,808 --> 00:06:17,809
Most.

86
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,958
Yes, the world's third
best training...

87
00:06:20,068 --> 00:06:22,316
I'm right back to questions
answer...

88
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:23,972
immediately after these words.

89
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:27,053
That was a close call,
was it not?

90
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,572
Not my fault I had Gaby's brother
to 't airport.

91
00:06:29,673 --> 00:06:32,392
You brought my family is there.

92
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,719
Because you 've never asked.
Because I knew you would say no.

93
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,733
That is not fair,
I took Gaby's brother.

94
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:41,658
You do a lot for Gaby
you never did for me.

95
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,420
I made you my producer.

96
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,461
I hired you to fill the time.

97
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,809
Back in ten.

98
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:48,998
I brought you this far because I
made us number one.

99
00:06:49,098 --> 00:06:51,177
That was a part of the
separation agreement.

100
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:54,280
What that means, because you my best
lawyer, you are my better man?

101
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,506
Do not make me laugh.

102
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,183
One.

103
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,319
Yes we are back.

104
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:02,454
This is Logan and Heart Burn
next five hours we are talking about...

105
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:04,373
paranoiac a.

106
00:07:04,473 --> 00:07:05,701
Paranoia.

107
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:08,184
I hope that I did well predicted.

108
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,251
I'm not sure.

109
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:11,252
What?

110
00:07:11,277 --> 00:07:12,699
Are you in shape?

111
00:07:14,103 --> 00:07:16,311
It is, Tashmahall.

112
00:07:17,111 --> 00:07:19,955
The Tashmahall makes you paranoid?

113
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,220
Yes, and I will tell you why.

114
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,237
Please do that.

115
00:07:22,347 --> 00:07:24,474
Have you ever, I mean seriously.

116
00:07:24,474 --> 00:07:29,475
Have you ever seen a picture not
taken from the front...

117
00:07:29,733 --> 00:07:31,999
You know with 't pool
on the front?

118
00:07:32,891 --> 00:07:36,800
I do not make jokes now,
't make me afraid.

119
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,444
Consider this to:

120
00:07:38,554 --> 00:07:40,999
Have you ever seen
large 't there?

121
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:43,713
Well I think about it, no.

122
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:48,389
Is it real or is someone
world fooled.

123
00:07:48,499 --> 00:07:50,535
What do you what it is?
A cardboard sign...

124
00:07:50,535 --> 00:07:52,982
what is painted and
onto a palace looks?

125
00:07:53,082 --> 00:07:55,603
Maybe?
And that makes you?

126
00:07:56,192 --> 00:07:58,367
That is why I am so paranoid.

127
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,146
I mean 'it's a famous palace?

128
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,289
I recommend it to be in India.

129
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:03,426
I do not know whether
Royal residence?

130
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:05,942
Is it a sort of White House...

131
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:09,094
or a Vegas casino?
You know...

132
00:08:09,104 --> 00:08:12,205
I've never really there
deep thought.

133
00:08:13,288 --> 00:08:15,320
And I'm for...

134
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,442
my loving friend.

135
00:08:17,651 --> 00:08:21,904
For clarity and respect to create
of the things we do not think.

136
00:08:21,914 --> 00:08:25,003
I think: you easy
can be found online.

137
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,941
No, make me redundant here.

138
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,729
You are paranoid.
Or not?

139
00:08:30,739 --> 00:08:35,984
Yes, and I am not alone,
therefore, they may call us and...

140
00:08:36,084 --> 00:08:39,232
tell you why so
paranoid America?

141
00:08:39,232 --> 00:08:42,499
You mean the guy
who lives opposite me?

142
00:08:42,727 --> 00:08:45,999
He sits on his porch
knife sharpening and stare...

143
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,425
every time I pass.

144
00:08:48,438 --> 00:08:51,439
You live in a guest who
his porch sharpens his knife?

145
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:52,650
Yes.

146
00:08:53,568 --> 00:08:54,887
And he's creepy.

147
00:08:54,987 --> 00:08:57,524
I'm afraid that he
One day passes by...

148
00:08:57,524 --> 00:08:59,888
puts me...

149
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,535
and then for a cup of sugar asks.

150
00:09:01,535 --> 00:09:03,172
In that order? Yes.

151
00:09:03,272 --> 00:09:05,327
That is something to worry about.

152
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,059
Okay, the lines light up.

153
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:10,592
Why America
are you so paranoid?

154
00:09:10,602 --> 00:09:12,757
Caller number two:
You are now in the broadcast.

155
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:14,078
Cat.

156
00:09:14,532 --> 00:09:15,571
Did h. ..

157
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:16,910
Cat.

158
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,378
Why does Mrs.
cat food you paranoid?

159
00:09:20,489 --> 00:09:23,607
I look at the different flavors
they have...

160
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:26,625
and I see beef
't look stand.

161
00:09:26,725 --> 00:09:30,082
So you is concerned,
in beef flavor cat food?

162
00:09:30,182 --> 00:09:33,961
Yes. It is a strange thing
a cat to enter, do not you?

163
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:37,108
I mean, I understand chicken and fish...

164
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,997
because that is my cat dead.

165
00:09:39,097 --> 00:09:40,275
Cats kill fish?

166
00:09:40,275 --> 00:09:43,372
I can imagine that you 't
complex math is...

167
00:09:43,372 --> 00:09:46,759
but he would 't easy
may in its claws.

168
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:49,961
They hunt not something dead.

169
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,148
You cat does not come from Texas?

170
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:57,755
If the cat food manufacturers
Our cats beef perform...

171
00:09:57,855 --> 00:09:59,883
which will "end up then?

172
00:09:59,983 --> 00:10:01,362
Who know, really?

173
00:10:01,362 --> 00:10:03,880
Maybe it is, as
into a film in 1970...

174
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,579
where people use them for food?

175
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:07,441
Solid Green?

176
00:10:09,598 --> 00:10:11,450
Paranoid.

177
00:10:12,455 --> 00:10:16,612
Our first caller is not only
paranoid but totally insane.

178
00:10:16,612 --> 00:10:18,091
That is my record are
is not it Gil?

179
00:10:18,191 --> 00:10:20,033
I think so.

180
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:26,574
If you roast cow cat
balls or ears eat, be happy.

181
00:10:26,684 --> 00:10:29,685
Be glad it's not free
than 49 cents per can.

182
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:33,141
I hope you think I
gene who have food...

183
00:10:33,141 --> 00:10:35,220
Lady, you're an idiot.

184
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,189
Thanks for the call.

185
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:40,546
Well there is someone who 's real
has reason to be paranoid?

186
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,825
Caller number three:
you are now...

187
00:10:42,835 --> 00:10:45,413
Heart Burn with Logan, and Bikkel Brickman.

188
00:10:45,413 --> 00:10:48,492
I must admit Logan,
I'm paranoid about aliens.

189
00:10:48,592 --> 00:10:49,660
Aliens...

190
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:54,096
Are you afraid they the Mexican border
cross beef cat and you perform?

191
00:10:54,106 --> 00:10:59,074
No I see people in shows
are taken to the room...

192
00:10:59,174 --> 00:11:01,642
and there were things
stopped in their rectum.

193
00:11:01,642 --> 00:11:03,371
Rectum, damn man kill them.

194
00:11:03,471 --> 00:11:05,175
Please sir,
This is a family show.

195
00:11:05,285 --> 00:11:06,500
Sorry. It is only...

196
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,491
I hear these things all the time...

197
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,047
and it is not alone in the country...

198
00:11:10,157 --> 00:11:11,635
but also in the city.

199
00:11:11,635 --> 00:11:14,470
They take you into their ship
and experiment with u. ..

200
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,894
do what they please.

201
00:11:15,904 --> 00:11:18,005
Have you ever heard of crop circles?

202
00:11:18,271 --> 00:11:19,470
Yes, I did.

203
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:20,863
And what do you know what they are?

204
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,911
I do not know.

205
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:23,707
This is another good example.

206
00:11:24,007 --> 00:11:25,163
Okay good.

207
00:11:25,363 --> 00:11:29,872
But just for fun,
what is the aim?

208
00:11:29,973 --> 00:11:32,464
Perhaps it is their way
for sending messages...

209
00:11:32,474 --> 00:11:34,165
they try to communicate with us.

210
00:11:34,175 --> 00:11:37,049
I thought you would say,
I knew you would say.

211
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:38,443
Let's put it this way:

212
00:11:38,443 --> 00:11:42,445
If these aliens
want to talk to us...

213
00:11:42,455 --> 00:11:45,539
communicate,
say: pull...

214
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:47,650
secret information from us.

215
00:11:48,143 --> 00:11:51,430
Sir, you know how
looks like an alien!

216
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,713
Aliens have a rectum?

217
00:11:53,723 --> 00:11:55,999
Burck? Have aliens that?

218
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,610
You sir are a moron.

219
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:04,308
If you're so paranoid about aliens,
you must not watch much television.

220
00:12:04,318 --> 00:12:07,621
Why our show is always
alien involved in pornography?

221
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:09,714
That's what I also wonder.

222
00:12:09,724 --> 00:12:12,569
Okay, we go further.

223
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:15,635
Our next caller...

224
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:18,228
Wijgerde to give his real name.

225
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:21,941
Okay, let's call him...?

226
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,583
Fred's your turn.

227
00:12:23,793 --> 00:12:25,844
What makes you so paranoid?

228
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:26,999
Muslims.

229
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:30,850
That 's good.

230
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,542
Fred, would you be more specific
want to be?

231
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:35,999
They blow their own for a
Some of our soldiers to kill.

232
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:39,521
Much Muslims...

233
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:40,999
inflated his own yet.

234
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,062
Maybe something else?

235
00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:45,565
The way they talk?

236
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:47,683
Of their dark skin?

237
00:12:47,783 --> 00:12:49,834
Their body odor.

238
00:12:49,844 --> 00:12:51,845
I mean, they keep goats.

239
00:12:51,845 --> 00:12:54,441
It's the fact that they are obsessed
have to hate us.

240
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,465
You know?

241
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:57,560
Fred I think you have something.

242
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,672
Perhaps that is why
they move to America?

243
00:12:59,782 --> 00:13:00,893
Closer to us?

244
00:13:00,903 --> 00:13:02,295
You ever heard to old adage:

245
00:13:02,305 --> 00:13:03,503
Keep your friends close...

246
00:13:03,503 --> 00:13:04,701
and your enemies closer.

247
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:08,720
I mean they live in
Middle East more than 10,000 years...

248
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,932
and still
they can not live together.

249
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,799
Have you seen them live?

250
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:15,400
I would also be jealous of America.

251
00:13:15,401 --> 00:13:17,500
They live in a country full of oil.

252
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,199
But living in houses of beetroot
The move by the smallest earthquake.

253
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,599
But I think that not much
buildings to provide in...

254
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,999
In a country full of
C4 and barbarians and murderers themselves.

255
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,099
Logan you know what your talking about?

256
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,299
It is his wife she would see him.

257
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,899
Tell her that he call back.

258
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,699
Gaby I call you during commercials, okay?

259
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:43,760
Military leader and hate everyone,
it does not on its way.

260
00:13:43,761 --> 00:13:45,400
I hear what you say sir.

261
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,748
Haternij is a terrible thing
no one does good.

262
00:13:48,749 --> 00:13:50,187
Is that not true, Gil?
-Yes...

263
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:54,362
Perhaps is it the business man
who sells American flags?

264
00:13:54,362 --> 00:13:55,363
Good point.

265
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,299
Above all, you do not fool around.

266
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,599
So you people hate Fred
the Middle East?

267
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,699
I just said: anyone who does not...

268
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,301
So you say you hate them?

269
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:06,600
That said, I can not twist the facts,
you present the words...

270
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:07,602
Since you have the people.

271
00:14:07,701 --> 00:14:09,800
Fred hates Muslims.

272
00:14:09,801 --> 00:14:11,002
Fred hates Arabs

273
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,202
Fred hates Persians.

274
00:14:12,301 --> 00:14:14,000
Fred probably hate the Jews.

275
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:16,092
And this just after I have said...

276
00:14:16,102 --> 00:14:18,300
haternij that nobody does well.

277
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,799
Fred expresses his true thoughts...

278
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,464
America and shows real voice.

279
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:26,773
Paranoia:

280
00:14:26,773 --> 00:14:28,779
Fear of the unknown...

281
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,325
what will emerge from
the shade and we will intervene...

282
00:14:31,325 --> 00:14:33,400
and taking away from us as we love.

283
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,366
Fear of Japanese technology
that depends on our ears...

284
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:37,552
as a claustrofobiezak.

285
00:14:38,552 --> 00:14:40,917
We are right back after these messages.
- The Tashmahall...

286
00:14:40,927 --> 00:14:43,612
lies not in the Middle East?

287
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,854
What is that?

288
00:14:46,854 --> 00:14:48,875
What is an ear thing?

289
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,162
That.

290
00:14:50,262 --> 00:14:51,353
Yes.

291
00:14:51,393 --> 00:14:54,014
It is a bluetooth for my cellphone!

292
00:14:55,657 --> 00:14:57,311
I need to poop.

293
00:14:58,132 --> 00:15:00,398
You gonna tell him that Gaby
has called? No, not yet.

294
00:15:00,408 --> 00:15:01,784
We have a good evening.

295
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:04,449
Tell him:
I expect him, okay?

296
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:06,118
You say it.

297
00:15:16,413 --> 00:15:18,400
I can not go.

298
00:15:22,265 --> 00:15:24,440
We can not stop.
They sit right behind us.

299
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,506
I did what I would put out.
-You must stop here.

300
00:15:27,516 --> 00:15:29,057
I want to die by their hands.

301
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:30,908
You make it without me.

302
00:15:30,943 --> 00:15:33,154
Please, stop it here.

303
00:15:36,294 --> 00:15:38,405
Do you want me to do?

304
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,571
No.

305
00:15:42,297 --> 00:15:46,409
I am his brother. I do it.

306
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,651
We are back in twenty.

307
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,599
You Vernin on a line that is paranoid
that his government phone tapping.

308
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,399
And a man on line two, who wants to know
why you hate Muslims so much.

309
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,399
And guy who is offended because
You have not answered call.

310
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,611
A few others talked about
a kind of attack.

311
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,826
What line does Vernin?

312
00:16:26,934 --> 00:16:28,935
Line one.

313
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,399
Four three...

314
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,092
And we are back and...

315
00:16:35,102 --> 00:16:36,594
the one who now tune...

316
00:16:36,604 --> 00:16:37,996
our topic tonight is...

317
00:16:38,006 --> 00:16:39,878
paranoia.

318
00:16:39,988 --> 00:16:42,599
On one line we have
an old friend.

319
00:16:42,864 --> 00:16:44,185
You're turn.

320
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,689
Hi Logan, Gil
I am Vernin.

321
00:16:48,691 --> 00:16:51,594
Our favorite caller who thinks
his phone is tapped.

322
00:16:51,604 --> 00:16:53,258
Again.

323
00:16:53,618 --> 00:16:55,693
Vernin you already
look under your bed?

324
00:16:55,793 --> 00:16:58,959
I am sure that somewhere there
Your flashlight is missing.

325
00:16:58,969 --> 00:17:01,045
I have a problem...

326
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,999
I am concerned to make.

327
00:17:03,121 --> 00:17:08,162
All clicks in a conversation,
all the time when I'm on a call.

328
00:17:08,272 --> 00:17:10,438
I think the FBI tapping my line.

329
00:17:10,448 --> 00:17:11,723
Show an interest.

330
00:17:11,723 --> 00:17:16,222
Vernin you considered the possibility,
you might have a bad phone?

331
00:17:16,275 --> 00:17:19,350
Or skip that and go
you right off at the FBI?

332
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,416
I am quite sure
that the FBI is.

333
00:17:21,426 --> 00:17:23,501
I think Vernin a good point.

334
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:27,843
Do you think you are so high on their radar is
they kind of research.

335
00:17:27,953 --> 00:17:31,394
I think I am, there is
no other explanation.

336
00:17:31,404 --> 00:17:33,680
I smoke weed sometimes and I...

337
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,999
Do not say that.

338
00:17:35,006 --> 00:17:38,401
I would if I drain his line
his last conversations was heard.

339
00:17:38,431 --> 00:17:42,272
Vernin your phone is not tapped.

340
00:17:42,382 --> 00:17:44,448
I think that!

341
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,746
You think?

342
00:17:45,746 --> 00:17:48,434
Your phones are tapped.

343
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,878
I think the president you tapping.

344
00:17:51,785 --> 00:17:53,786
I must go.

345
00:17:53,961 --> 00:17:56,182
I hear a kind of noise outside.

346
00:17:57,036 --> 00:17:59,778
And put the Minister of Defense
greetings from me.

347
00:17:59,888 --> 00:18:01,898
Vernin Day!

348
00:18:02,063 --> 00:18:06,605
Yes I am quite sure that
FBI listening to this program.

349
00:18:06,615 --> 00:18:08,990
Our next caller is now.

350
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,156
Hello? Am I in the broadcast?

351
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,642
He he easy. You sound...

352
00:18:13,642 --> 00:18:15,707
whacked on the face.

353
00:18:15,717 --> 00:18:17,793
Besides the building.

354
00:18:17,893 --> 00:18:19,959
There is a kind of attack after
I think the game started.

355
00:18:19,969 --> 00:18:23,020
People are crazy here.
- I saw them running along in front of me.

356
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,285
It is everyone in the street.

357
00:18:26,395 --> 00:18:30,396
It is a bit early to
championship to celebrate, do not you?

358
00:18:30,947 --> 00:18:33,122
Should not they have
three races this year?

359
00:18:33,122 --> 00:18:37,164
The police is there, but they do
nothing. Calm down.

360
00:18:37,274 --> 00:18:39,439
I'm not joking man!

361
00:18:39,449 --> 00:18:41,725
It is here in the city, you can
not see from your window?

362
00:18:41,825 --> 00:18:44,846
Gil? Let's go to the window.

363
00:18:48,352 --> 00:18:50,553
Okay people stay with us.

364
00:18:52,103 --> 00:18:54,314
Look out the window?

365
00:18:54,579 --> 00:18:57,055
Sorry buddy I see
just buildings.

366
00:18:57,055 --> 00:18:59,167
We hear sirens.

367
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:01,082
And I thought not.

368
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,393
They run like mad crazy.

369
00:19:04,857 --> 00:19:07,933
Well people this is not a family show...

370
00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:10,099
but no freak show.

371
00:19:10,109 --> 00:19:12,184
Check the locks on the door...

372
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,909
and we again
work.

373
00:19:18,611 --> 00:19:24,799
Great not only the FCC hates us,
but God has it in our targeting.

374
00:19:24,838 --> 00:19:26,890
Sorry people the light
out in the studio.

375
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,991
Burck I talked to someone?

376
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:33,044
The back-up check everything
and the computers are blocked.

377
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:41,743
Yes people, I believe that God still
saves. The lights are entered again.

378
00:19:41,843 --> 00:19:43,909
Maybe the aliens
Lo for us?

379
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,795
I mean, they love
that flashing thing.

380
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:48,970
Why they show so much hate?

381
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,046
There are many reasons.

382
00:19:50,046 --> 00:19:54,495
Let us try to go back
to the community here.

383
00:19:54,597 --> 00:19:55,785
Caller number four you are now.

384
00:19:55,785 --> 00:19:57,873
Please save me here.

385
00:19:57,973 --> 00:20:00,414
Can I get no television,
this is real?

386
00:20:00,424 --> 00:20:05,766
I am beginning to think that paranoia is not
was a good topic for tonight.

387
00:20:05,876 --> 00:20:08,151
I ask myself the Gilman...

388
00:20:08,151 --> 00:20:11,200
where would the city when I
imparted no sense?

389
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,093
I ask me all the time.

390
00:20:13,103 --> 00:20:16,868
Throw the dice
and we will show another caller.

391
00:20:16,978 --> 00:20:19,730
It is time the truth
to face.

392
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,971
There is no time for innocence
not because he looks in his domain.

393
00:20:23,081 --> 00:20:26,247
The age of innocence,
the end is near...

394
00:20:26,257 --> 00:20:27,632
it is a centuries old saying.

395
00:20:27,632 --> 00:20:29,843
Pa? Are you the weather.

396
00:20:30,408 --> 00:20:32,684
I change my number.

397
00:20:32,784 --> 00:20:37,805
The call is free tonight
VEE to this hospital psychiatrist.

398
00:20:39,311 --> 00:20:41,376
Let's take a call.

399
00:20:41,486 --> 00:20:43,662
Logan you hear me?

400
00:20:43,662 --> 00:20:45,828
There is something wrong.

401
00:20:46,238 --> 00:20:48,350
There is another attack.

402
00:20:53,264 --> 00:20:55,249
In seven States.

403
00:20:56,716 --> 00:21:00,957
People have been here a situation.

404
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:05,408
I'm going to break...

405
00:21:05,418 --> 00:21:08,394
to get more information.

406
00:21:08,494 --> 00:21:11,495
Please keep listening.

407
00:21:11,945 --> 00:21:13,946
I'll be back.

408
00:21:14,121 --> 00:21:18,362
Close doors and windows stay inside.

409
00:21:18,472 --> 00:21:20,584
Come quick advertising.

410
00:21:29,351 --> 00:21:31,516
Listen very carefully:

411
00:21:31,526 --> 00:21:34,737
Call the children together
and...

412
00:21:35,278 --> 00:21:38,053
No, I do not understand what
is going on.

413
00:21:38,053 --> 00:21:39,219
I can not explain it.

414
00:21:39,229 --> 00:21:42,405
Call the children together
and...

415
00:21:42,405 --> 00:21:43,980
What do you think?

416
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,181
You can not stay home, now.

417
00:21:48,132 --> 00:21:50,197
Listen to me.

418
00:21:50,207 --> 00:21:52,091
I look!

419
00:21:53,283 --> 00:21:55,349
I can 't explain.

420
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:57,534
Listen I gotta go.

421
00:21:57,534 --> 00:22:00,535
I love you. I must go.

422
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,329
We will stop above
for injections.

423
00:22:43,097 --> 00:22:44,418
What?

424
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:48,822
In the confusion I lost my bag.

425
00:23:07,104 --> 00:23:10,103
That happens now.

426
00:23:10,103 --> 00:23:11,202
What happens?

427
00:23:11,203 --> 00:23:12,452
I do not know.

428
00:23:12,553 --> 00:23:15,702
A kind of rebellion
broke out after the game.

429
00:23:15,702 --> 00:23:19,701
All people
running around and screaming.

430
00:23:19,702 --> 00:23:21,760
Tourism will take them.

431
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,921
Look where you talkin 'snippet.

432
00:23:23,939 --> 00:23:25,378
This woman, she was...

433
00:23:25,478 --> 00:23:27,017
I understand now that...

434
00:23:27,017 --> 00:23:29,375
they go completely through the ribbon.

435
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:33,999
We thought we looked
to a picture of my body.

436
00:23:34,332 --> 00:23:36,333
And so suddenly jumped on.

437
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,418
She was totally crazy.

438
00:23:40,457 --> 00:23:42,458
I get 'm.

439
00:23:44,906 --> 00:23:46,504
Hello?

440
00:23:48,655 --> 00:23:50,642
How many stations?

441
00:23:52,705 --> 00:23:54,826
We can if we want.

442
00:23:55,655 --> 00:23:57,866
Let me ask it to Logan?

443
00:23:58,204 --> 00:23:59,287
It is Carl...

444
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:01,790
He says:
All stations are overschakeld...

445
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,875
to go to the emergency broadcast system.

446
00:24:03,885 --> 00:24:06,836
He wants us to switch.
- What...?

447
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,466
Carl I'm 't Logan.

448
00:24:09,576 --> 00:24:12,171
Well we can not switch
We are in the middle of the show.

449
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:15,999
We are a few
blocks away from this thing.

450
00:24:16,062 --> 00:24:19,147
Let them
switch if they want.

451
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:22,453
The people with one voice
a reason and not a stranger.

452
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,999
I am calm.

453
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,099
I am calm.

454
00:24:28,241 --> 00:24:30,240
I must continue to broadcast.

455
00:24:30,338 --> 00:24:33,919
I must tell people that:
they stay away from the city.

456
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:38,880
We have half million listeners
without access to television.

457
00:24:42,015 --> 00:24:44,199
Are we the only 't building?

458
00:24:44,209 --> 00:24:47,303
Yeah I think we, the
some of the studio but...

459
00:24:47,303 --> 00:24:48,987
I do not know
the rest of the building.

460
00:24:48,997 --> 00:24:52,390
Yeah I think so
but I'm not sure...

461
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,326
I mean it's Friday.

462
00:24:56,129 --> 00:24:59,632
What? Why this strange questions?

463
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,199
What time does the door
locked down?

464
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,899
The front of 't building
automatically closes to nine hours...

465
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,399
who is on a timer, but...

466
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,599
the garage and elevator are always open.

467
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,156
Should we lock?

468
00:25:09,276 --> 00:25:11,568
Find I'm Nathalie,
I report from the city.

469
00:25:11,578 --> 00:25:15,439
And this is one of the worst incidents
we have seen so far.

470
00:25:15,449 --> 00:25:16,517
Oh my god.

471
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:18,851
They pull the officer out of his car.

472
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:21,162
They attack him.

473
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:27,392
Carl you see this,
they seize a cop now?

474
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,935
I stay in the air
until this is under control.

475
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,987
I gotta go.

476
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:35,084
Exactly a moment ago
was a reporter...

477
00:25:38,202 --> 00:25:39,969
See that?

478
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:46,552
How can they live broadcasting?

479
00:25:46,562 --> 00:25:47,563
What have we?

480
00:25:47,573 --> 00:25:48,575
What is his name?

481
00:25:48,578 --> 00:25:49,580
Tom. It is Ted.

482
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,373
We must tell them the
door lock to do.

483
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,484
Come on.

484
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,055
What about the garage?

485
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:56,376
Call them. Yes.

486
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,434
This way.

487
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:41,110
Still no answer?

488
00:27:44,033 --> 00:27:46,244
Burck I must return
the air!

489
00:27:47,949 --> 00:27:50,035
It is all yours.

490
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:52,971
I see what
going on. Gil search.

491
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:54,289
Wait Burns.

492
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:05,300
Logan, Gaby called earlier.

493
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,733
What? Where?

494
00:28:06,843 --> 00:28:08,295
Early.

495
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:10,387
Why did not you?

496
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:13,892
You were in progress, there
was nothing to worry about.

497
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:16,203
Reply:
Please try again later.

498
00:28:27,866 --> 00:28:31,099
Please. It is for us both.

499
00:28:32,162 --> 00:28:35,274
I do not know. Let me think...

500
00:28:37,457 --> 00:28:39,558
You're such an idiot.

501
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,501
You can not blame me.

502
00:28:44,501 --> 00:28:47,287
It was your brother
the early release.

503
00:28:47,397 --> 00:28:51,044
Khalil's death.
He paid for his mistake.

504
00:28:51,044 --> 00:28:55,058
And you also pay. There is no
enough for both of us.

505
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:01,275
Come on now.

506
00:30:49,246 --> 00:30:50,347
I'm down...

507
00:30:50,483 --> 00:30:51,901
on 6th Street Bridge.

508
00:30:51,901 --> 00:30:54,409
All cars are stopped
and everyone is there.

509
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,637
They honk but...?

510
00:30:55,737 --> 00:30:57,254
It is not...! Hold on.

511
00:30:57,354 --> 00:30:59,290
What do you see?

512
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,502
God no... please!

513
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,877
Sir, you remain in me,
what happens?

514
00:31:04,987 --> 00:31:06,313
They are on foot.

515
00:31:06,313 --> 00:31:09,091
I guess' t people
the cars must be!

516
00:31:09,191 --> 00:31:11,292
They have kids.

517
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,071
They draw me into the street.

518
00:31:14,106 --> 00:31:16,142
I can not explain.

519
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:19,911
Is there any police
or first aid personnel.

520
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:24,023
Please someone do something good
and go to the 6th Street Bridge.

521
00:31:25,682 --> 00:31:28,003
It's unbelievable.

522
00:31:30,953 --> 00:31:34,591
There is something seriously wrong, it is
not the normal course of business.

523
00:31:34,691 --> 00:31:37,076
It is not fucking normal.

524
00:31:37,086 --> 00:31:39,187
It is not normal.

525
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,039
There is something wrong.
It is their eyes.

526
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:51,243
They bleed from their eyes.

527
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:55,704
Someone has sprayed them with
pepper spray and then became mad.

528
00:31:55,714 --> 00:31:57,238
But that 's not.

529
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:59,879
No
words' t explain.

530
00:32:13,844 --> 00:32:15,920
Old Corn are you still there?

531
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,848
Mr. you hear us?

532
00:32:17,958 --> 00:32:19,796
Yes I'm still here.

533
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,172
I'm in my truck.

534
00:32:22,172 --> 00:32:23,858
I lie on the floor.

535
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,061
They are out here.

536
00:32:26,348 --> 00:32:28,560
Shit. Please.

537
00:32:29,724 --> 00:32:32,501
You should send somebody over.

538
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:36,502
Sir I have asked for help.
- Stay low...

539
00:32:36,577 --> 00:32:38,543
Stay calm, be quiet.

540
00:32:38,615 --> 00:32:41,467
Darling I love you so much.
- I come home.

541
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,023
I'm so scared.

542
00:32:43,033 --> 00:32:45,295
We will send help to you

543
00:32:45,305 --> 00:32:48,531
Help is on the way, stay calm.

544
00:32:48,631 --> 00:32:50,952
If someone in the
close to the 6th Street...

545
00:32:52,957 --> 00:32:55,809
People running around,
they bleed.

546
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:59,851
Please God,
let me find them?

547
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:01,746
Oh damn.

548
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,414
Oh, no, no.

549
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,506
Shit they see me.

550
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:07,837
The guy sees me.

551
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:10,940
No god... no!

552
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:14,759
No...

553
00:33:21,183 --> 00:33:25,194
We need to know
is going on.

554
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:27,488
Let 'get away.

555
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:28,589
No.

556
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:31,959
We are much safer here.

557
00:33:34,529 --> 00:33:36,530
Where is Burck?

558
00:35:07,674 --> 00:35:09,797
Close.

559
00:35:40,003 --> 00:35:41,836
Help?

560
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,307
Help?

561
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:49,284
Give me coverage?

562
00:35:49,385 --> 00:35:51,496
Asked little help here?

563
00:35:52,124 --> 00:35:53,963
Come on. That 't.

564
00:35:54,064 --> 00:35:55,103
Get him out of the elevator.

565
00:35:55,104 --> 00:35:57,226
Is he still alive? No.

566
00:35:57,336 --> 00:35:59,458
Everyone remains remote.

567
00:35:59,568 --> 00:36:01,800
Gil what is going on here?

568
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,922
What did you do that?

569
00:36:04,032 --> 00:36:05,051
What?

570
00:36:05,152 --> 00:36:07,400
Now they can come up
when he comes down.

571
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,402
Not be thought not to
friends to bring?

572
00:36:09,402 --> 00:36:13,501
That was not the intention
I saw him down.

573
00:36:13,502 --> 00:36:14,601
We must do something
before he wakes.

574
00:36:14,601 --> 00:36:16,500
We must do something now!

575
00:36:16,501 --> 00:36:17,502
Stop.

576
00:36:17,602 --> 00:36:20,018
Stop it, he is already awake.

577
00:36:20,128 --> 00:36:22,787
We must do something
she stops for good.

578
00:36:22,887 --> 00:36:24,946
How do you do?

579
00:36:24,947 --> 00:36:26,945
Burck?

580
00:36:27,006 --> 00:36:28,090
Come on guys...

581
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,188
we keep on with what we did.

582
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,704
This is a joke... Burck

583
00:36:35,814 --> 00:36:36,918
would it kill them?

584
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,755
Quiet man.

585
00:36:39,055 --> 00:36:41,156
Keep everyone away.

586
00:36:45,913 --> 00:36:47,900
Stay away.

587
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,787
That is not good.

588
00:36:57,295 --> 00:37:00,693
I'm not sure I happy or
afraid that he is here?

589
00:37:00,693 --> 00:37:03,692
It would not take so long for
him to the garage to come.

590
00:37:03,692 --> 00:37:06,087
He is a floor
of us got off.

591
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,254
Shit. He closes.

592
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:13,281
The release button is there.

593
00:37:13,281 --> 00:37:14,814
I got it.

594
00:37:14,824 --> 00:37:16,366
He has keys, right?

595
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:18,368
Yes it is security guard.

596
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:21,249
We are not finished here.

597
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:30,614
And what would that do?

598
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,529
The elevator is broken.
I go with the stairs.

599
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:38,651
You can not leave me.

600
00:37:40,724 --> 00:37:44,460
You can not infection
The show...

601
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,771
take over.

602
00:37:49,633 --> 00:37:54,587
I trained you not to panic
in every situation, but you did 't.

603
00:37:54,674 --> 00:37:58,669
I will not risk the risk of
I survive because of your mistakes.

604
00:37:59,244 --> 00:38:01,831
There is not enough
antiserum for both of us.

605
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:09,249
How you leave the world
is yours.

606
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,087
I honor you have learned.

607
00:38:23,736 --> 00:38:25,947
Ask me here do not disappoint them.

608
00:38:43,216 --> 00:38:48,405
I need to Gaby, she has to
the car and start driving.

609
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:50,263
Where?

610
00:38:50,894 --> 00:38:52,183
Everywhere, makes no difference.
- Just away.

611
00:38:52,184 --> 00:38:56,263
Seriously the roads are blocked,
you heard what happened on the bridge.

612
00:38:56,264 --> 00:38:58,346
Tell her that the door
and finally, to 'light up...

613
00:38:58,356 --> 00:39:00,438
and she just does not at home.

614
00:39:00,448 --> 00:39:02,941
I'm sorry I did not
said that she called.

615
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:04,123
Whatever.

616
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,134
Shit, in conversation.

617
00:39:06,222 --> 00:39:08,411
Here, I will try.
- Leave it.

618
00:39:28,392 --> 00:39:31,343
Burck? Are there any callers?

619
00:39:38,678 --> 00:39:40,889
Okay, you are.

620
00:39:41,042 --> 00:39:43,096
Where are you man?
What happened?

621
00:39:43,106 --> 00:39:45,760
You sounded rather overwrought, sucker.

622
00:39:46,535 --> 00:39:48,863
Well we had something to settle here.

623
00:39:48,963 --> 00:39:51,284
And leave your post,
that you can not do it.

624
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:56,833
We had things
our plates here.

625
00:39:56,843 --> 00:39:58,794
Paranoia.

626
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,447
What is it? You asked for it.

627
00:40:01,457 --> 00:40:03,568
I recommend that you have now, sucker.

628
00:40:03,765 --> 00:40:05,766
You're an asshole.

629
00:40:15,301 --> 00:40:20,302
People it seems that we nou
get the news on TV.

630
00:40:20,815 --> 00:40:22,830
Good evening.

631
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:26,782
This is an announcement,
I do not ask.

632
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:31,949
Around 23.05 in the East...

633
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:37,354
and 20:05 at the West Coast have my number
been explosions at sports events...

634
00:40:37,374 --> 00:40:40,381
and public places
throughout the country.

635
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:46,593
The report says that explosions
little damage done.

636
00:40:46,603 --> 00:40:49,810
There is evidence that these explosions...

637
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:57,422
the beginning of the release of toxic
substances in the vicinity of explosions.

638
00:40:57,532 --> 00:41:01,744
We are not sure of the nature
of what is released at this time.

639
00:41:01,854 --> 00:41:03,861
The Center for Diseases Control....

640
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:08,965
are engaged in many tests
and with their finding...

641
00:41:09,075 --> 00:41:10,682
as soon as possible.

642
00:41:10,782 --> 00:41:12,990
Eventually it happens.
The total number of....

643
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:16,987
victims who are infected
can run in the 10,000...

644
00:41:16,997 --> 00:41:19,105
and maybe more.
The state police...

645
00:41:19,105 --> 00:41:21,512
is put to work in all States.

646
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:26,517
And an immediate terrorist threat, the National
red status issued.

647
00:41:26,727 --> 00:41:31,786
All Americans are considered
to remain calm.

648
00:41:31,887 --> 00:41:35,541
Stay home and stay inside.

649
00:41:36,055 --> 00:41:40,270
And turn on your television and
radio broadcast for further information.

650
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:42,767
Is this all they know?

651
00:41:42,777 --> 00:41:44,900
Unless they are free to advertise.

652
00:41:49,899 --> 00:41:52,000
That is not logical.

653
00:41:52,206 --> 00:41:57,058
How can an explosion of people together
so let rip apart.

654
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:03,633
Carjacking: Maybe if people
leave as soon as possible.

655
00:42:03,743 --> 00:42:07,855
My partner Gilman agrees.

656
00:42:10,664 --> 00:42:12,872
You are in the broadcast.

657
00:42:12,972 --> 00:42:17,966
Man I'll tell you what I know because
it is much worse than you see on TV.

658
00:42:17,986 --> 00:42:20,183
And I do not know why they wait?

659
00:42:20,193 --> 00:42:24,498
It is obvious that everyone
can see that these things are sick.

660
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:26,829
They consume us ugly quickly.

661
00:42:28,001 --> 00:42:29,800
These things man...

662
00:42:29,801 --> 00:42:31,100
run on the street...

663
00:42:31,201 --> 00:42:32,300
with bleeding eyes

664
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:34,400
It is not a rebellion that I know.

665
00:42:34,401 --> 00:42:36,500
I live 2 km from the arena and...

666
00:42:36,501 --> 00:42:38,800
There is no Star Drag me where I
may add to, you follow me?

667
00:42:38,801 --> 00:42:39,900
No, I do not know what you say!

668
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,299
Can you be clearer?

669
00:42:41,301 --> 00:42:42,500
I try.

670
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,699
It's like rabies.

671
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,799
You sometimes have a dog
seen to that.

672
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,999
They bite and scratch you.

673
00:42:48,001 --> 00:42:50,602
They have and are
as fast as a rabbit.

674
00:42:50,602 --> 00:42:53,001
Someone has damaged them well.
- What you say is...

675
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:55,604
that this is a hondsdolheidbom?

676
00:42:55,604 --> 00:42:58,395
Logan got a situation here.

677
00:42:58,405 --> 00:43:00,257
I'll be back with you

678
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,999
Hey guys!

679
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,008
Security Agent Tanner has
gekrapt me in the elevator.

680
00:43:06,108 --> 00:43:07,302
Should I be worried?

681
00:43:07,302 --> 00:43:10,094
Blood you?

682
00:43:10,204 --> 00:43:12,096
No. I think not.

683
00:43:12,106 --> 00:43:14,200
Feel that you are going crazy?

684
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,299
Yes all the days of my life.

685
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,299
You're right.

686
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,399
Uh, are you there caller?

687
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,299
Okay, people...

688
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,799
I look at a map on the
TV in our studio.

689
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:59,799
I recommend so that the displayed cities
the one who attacked.

690
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,076
In no particular order,
We have...

691
00:44:03,186 --> 00:44:05,217
Washington, DC...

692
00:44:05,227 --> 00:44:06,538
New York City...

693
00:44:06,648 --> 00:44:08,767
Pittsburgh...

694
00:44:08,869 --> 00:44:10,820
Seattle...

695
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,786
Santiago...

696
00:44:13,886 --> 00:44:15,887
Los Angeles.

697
00:44:19,402 --> 00:44:21,469
The disastrous.

698
00:44:21,579 --> 00:44:23,857
Gaby if you can hear me?

699
00:44:23,857 --> 00:44:26,135
Please call me?

700
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:29,354
People Gaby is my wife...

701
00:44:29,454 --> 00:44:32,012
I hope that first call.

702
00:44:32,012 --> 00:44:35,013
But our lines are open.

703
00:44:35,789 --> 00:44:39,067
We will take your call
tonight...

704
00:44:39,067 --> 00:44:41,290
So please call us.

705
00:44:45,622 --> 00:44:47,619
Our lines are open.

706
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,678
I do not know.

707
00:44:58,732 --> 00:45:01,619
These terrorists are smart?

708
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,399
Or stupid.
They have a super virus...

709
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:09,399
where they know
very effective...

710
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,799
they should know that
This is global.

711
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:15,099
And with them comes back
and will distribute them.

712
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:18,399
Nobody has said:
it comes from the Middle East.

713
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,499
What do you think it comes from?

714
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:25,299
Perhaps the Tashmahall, Gil?
- That's good.

715
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,599
Anthrax came not from
the Middle East.

716
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,699
Let us a call.

717
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:33,699
You are.
With Logan and Gil and Lucy.

718
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,799
Logan Hey listen:

719
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,001
I call from the bridge and they are the
craziest of the entire city.

720
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:41,800
I can see them running on the streets
they are crazy and...

721
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,892
go in and out of the houses and get...

722
00:45:43,918 --> 00:45:45,907
all women and children out.

723
00:45:45,907 --> 00:45:46,996
You saw that?

724
00:45:47,096 --> 00:45:49,535
Yeah that shit is right for me.

725
00:45:49,535 --> 00:45:51,693
Sorry, I can say is that
in the broadcast?

726
00:45:51,793 --> 00:45:53,851
You do not have to make your
the FCC.

727
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:56,530
You said: Eastbrook?
Yes South just after Monrou.

728
00:45:57,521 --> 00:45:58,590
What happens there?

729
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:01,416
They are crazy. They are everywhere.
- I gotta go.

730
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:02,713
I must go now.

731
00:46:02,743 --> 00:46:04,828
Gaby if you hear me baby...

732
00:46:04,838 --> 00:46:06,512
you must lock all doors...

733
00:46:06,512 --> 00:46:08,075
and barricade the house.

734
00:46:08,185 --> 00:46:09,384
Please call me?

735
00:46:09,394 --> 00:46:12,102
I am sure
Logan that they are in order.

736
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:14,054
I must go.

737
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:16,133
Logan, wait.

738
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:20,125
Wait. Think.
- You'll never.

739
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:21,380
She's right.

740
00:46:21,481 --> 00:46:26,188
The roads are blocked, as
you will get stuck running.

741
00:46:26,298 --> 00:46:28,034
Unless you have an engine.

742
00:46:28,062 --> 00:46:30,284
Say you're with the engine today?

743
00:46:31,888 --> 00:46:33,165
It's in the garage.

744
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,732
You must give me the keys.

745
00:46:34,942 --> 00:46:37,786
You have never driven motor,
that your death.

746
00:46:37,896 --> 00:46:40,788
How hard can 't be?
You just need to give gas.

747
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:43,801
No man comes to your garage
not even out.

748
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,122
He goes on.

749
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:54,011
You have contact with the Burn Harts.
- Here comes the beep.

750
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,512
Gaby?

751
00:46:55,696 --> 00:46:57,071
Gaby, are you there?

752
00:46:57,081 --> 00:47:00,699
Honey wake up in hell
and answer the phone.

753
00:47:00,935 --> 00:47:04,256
Look, if you receive
close everything off and call you 'precinct.

754
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:05,791
I do not know what else to do.

755
00:47:05,891 --> 00:47:06,892
I love you Gaby.

756
00:47:06,992 --> 00:47:08,491
I'm afraid.

757
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,675
Find somewhere safe
to you hiding.

758
00:47:10,695 --> 00:47:11,937
You'll be safe.

759
00:47:11,947 --> 00:47:13,798
Okay it'll go fine with you.

760
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:16,389
I love you.

761
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:25,636
I.

762
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:26,677
What?

763
00:47:27,994 --> 00:47:29,095
I.

764
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:31,699
I'm the only one who can
motorcycling.

765
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,370
It can kill you.

766
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:35,460
I can not ask you to do.

767
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,826
You don 't even ask...

768
00:47:36,936 --> 00:47:38,937
because I won 't al

769
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:43,390
The craziest sit right in the city,
I have invented.

770
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:46,464
I go through the side roads and
you continue to broadcast.

771
00:47:46,564 --> 00:47:48,665
And you do that for me?

772
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:51,501
But let me not play violin.

773
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:53,999
Of course I do 't for you

774
00:47:54,116 --> 00:47:56,399
Keep it in the air.

775
00:47:56,731 --> 00:47:58,029
Do what you do best.

776
00:47:58,039 --> 00:47:59,446
I do not know what to say?

777
00:47:59,546 --> 00:48:01,662
Well that was the first time.

778
00:48:01,762 --> 00:48:02,863
Ok.

779
00:48:03,177 --> 00:48:05,178
If your house gets my...

780
00:48:05,192 --> 00:48:06,589
when the roads are open...

781
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:09,807
Didi you get and Gaby,
that stop you in the SUV...

782
00:48:09,907 --> 00:48:11,571
and you leave the city.

783
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:17,518
What if 't as bad as we thought?

784
00:48:17,528 --> 00:48:19,527
Then barricaded the house.

785
00:48:19,713 --> 00:48:22,835
You may even screw it up Gaby's curtains.

786
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:26,470
Hey!

787
00:48:26,854 --> 00:48:28,238
That ear thing...

788
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:30,339
that fits under your helmet?

789
00:48:31,524 --> 00:48:34,911
Okay, I've brought him,
long...

790
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:37,405
He should not be covered
He is able to broadcast.

791
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,205
This is an amazing traffic report.

792
00:48:39,215 --> 00:48:40,399
Be careful.

793
00:48:40,701 --> 00:48:42,277
That will be good radio.

794
00:48:42,387 --> 00:48:44,386
I don 't owe, Pali.

795
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:46,479
No, you have me
number one radio show put...

796
00:48:46,489 --> 00:48:48,001
when I had no salary.

797
00:48:48,693 --> 00:48:49,799
But...

798
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:51,386
there is one thing.

799
00:48:51,587 --> 00:48:52,699
If I survive...

800
00:48:52,981 --> 00:48:54,518
I want Tuesday.

801
00:48:54,528 --> 00:48:56,527
Reach my family...

802
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:59,940
and I play for you
all my charity.

803
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:00,995
Hear that?

804
00:49:01,005 --> 00:49:02,006
Yes.

805
00:49:02,007 --> 00:49:03,008
Ok.

806
00:49:03,009 --> 00:49:04,303
I go with you down.

807
00:49:04,303 --> 00:49:05,922
I can bring up the elevator.

808
00:49:06,022 --> 00:49:08,343
'm Sure he leaves the garage.

809
00:49:13,217 --> 00:49:15,233
Sure that you
The elevator will go?

810
00:49:15,233 --> 00:49:17,999
I'm definitely not the stairs,
if you mean?

811
00:49:18,348 --> 00:49:20,559
I'm probably weird
but not crazy.

812
00:49:21,029 --> 00:49:22,978
Showtime.

813
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:25,511
Talk to us.

814
00:49:26,472 --> 00:49:28,369
Good luck.

815
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,381
Are you ready?

816
00:49:43,697 --> 00:49:45,315
Ready.

817
00:49:48,765 --> 00:49:50,687
Everything okay?

818
00:49:53,874 --> 00:49:54,875
Are you there friend?

819
00:49:55,118 --> 00:49:56,161
Yes, I am.

820
00:49:56,261 --> 00:49:57,799
We are now down.

821
00:49:58,604 --> 00:50:00,347
People 's next...

822
00:50:00,347 --> 00:50:03,233
I hope that short
will be expensive.

823
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:05,899
Will you listen to my live
broadcast...

824
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,803
of my very good friend of mine.

825
00:50:07,813 --> 00:50:10,472
Actually my very good friend...

826
00:50:10,572 --> 00:50:12,324
Gilbert Brickman.

827
00:50:12,432 --> 00:50:14,899
He goes into the street.

828
00:50:15,087 --> 00:50:19,088
To my attempt to get my...

829
00:50:19,097 --> 00:50:20,552
family to reach ..

830
00:50:20,552 --> 00:50:21,870
my wife and daughter.

831
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:24,937
But also to our lives
to ensure...

832
00:50:24,947 --> 00:50:27,020
and not lose, by...

833
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:32,082
the terrible events
today.

834
00:50:32,797 --> 00:50:35,664
I will gladly die for.

835
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:41,473
Shit, you bastard Murphy.

836
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:44,064
They are again.

837
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:49,852
All good guy?

838
00:50:52,366 --> 00:50:53,467
Oh shit!

839
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:59,449
All good guy?

840
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:02,286
I 't.

841
00:51:04,128 --> 00:51:06,229
Dirty freak, fuck off.

842
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,999
Please help me?

843
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:13,490
Get off me?

844
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:15,104
Get off me?

845
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:20,436
Do not force me...

846
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:25,800
Sorry Lora.

847
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,551
Sorry.

848
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,072
I put him first...

849
00:51:29,303 --> 00:51:30,854
in his stomach.

850
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:32,628
I got it stuck.

851
00:51:34,857 --> 00:51:36,960
I get it out of the elevator.

852
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:43,805
I'm not sure what you want
I do this but...

853
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:46,127
I love me the plan.

854
00:51:46,137 --> 00:51:47,894
I send the elevator back up...

855
00:51:47,994 --> 00:51:50,519
Burck but will not sit.

856
00:51:51,822 --> 00:51:52,823
Look, you know?

857
00:51:53,304 --> 00:51:54,786
I had no choice.

858
00:51:54,786 --> 00:51:56,787
I really had no choice.

859
00:51:57,349 --> 00:51:59,101
Keep the door open.

860
00:52:01,177 --> 00:52:03,305
It is not your fault.

861
00:52:03,305 --> 00:52:04,532
Bit crazy that you say.

862
00:52:04,632 --> 00:52:05,958
Are you OK?

863
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:08,089
I have the feeling that I
vomiting.

864
00:52:08,612 --> 00:52:09,819
No, no Gil...

865
00:52:09,819 --> 00:52:11,491
fuck you go to my family.

866
00:52:11,633 --> 00:52:12,634
Are you OK?

867
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:13,741
Yes.

868
00:52:14,946 --> 00:52:17,897
Happy.
He could not touch me.

869
00:52:48,741 --> 00:52:50,842
I'm with my engine.

870
00:52:55,482 --> 00:52:56,483
Come on.

871
00:52:56,589 --> 00:52:57,796
My engine.

872
00:52:58,096 --> 00:52:59,508
My engine.

873
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,833
Fucking come on...

874
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:06,931
I try to get away.
- Here we go.

875
00:53:40,733 --> 00:53:42,734
There is one just behind me.

876
00:53:46,364 --> 00:53:48,240
Hands off!

877
00:53:52,095 --> 00:53:54,084
Okay, take this motherfucker.

878
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:16,506
I'm at the gate.

879
00:54:26,578 --> 00:54:28,030
Get out of here.

880
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,221
I'm out.
I'm on the street.

881
00:54:38,222 --> 00:54:40,900
We are close to your friend.

882
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:42,901
Disconnect sometimes but
We receive you.

883
00:54:43,001 --> 00:54:46,403
She followed me out,
but the port is still open.

884
00:54:46,483 --> 00:54:49,652
There were a couple back inside,
I do not know what they are.

885
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:51,178
Did you lift off?

886
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:53,323
Lucy is working on it.

887
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:54,655
Ok.

888
00:54:54,808 --> 00:54:57,762
I would say anything barricade...

889
00:54:57,862 --> 00:54:59,921
and open for anything or anyone.

890
00:55:00,931 --> 00:55:02,299
I think I'm lost.

891
00:55:02,408 --> 00:55:04,585
You see street signs?

892
00:55:04,685 --> 00:55:06,796
No nothing.

893
00:55:07,462 --> 00:55:09,529
Are you still in town?

894
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:11,507
Hold on.

895
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:15,522
Gil what happens?

896
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:18,867
Can you hear me scream?

897
00:55:21,383 --> 00:55:23,374
Oh, shit. What?

898
00:55:23,704 --> 00:55:24,963
I must get out of here.

899
00:55:25,064 --> 00:55:27,123
There are freaks everywhere.

900
00:55:27,124 --> 00:55:28,455
Hang on.

901
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:38,334
I'm going off.

902
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:41,328
There is a back ..

903
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:44,341
Well I drive the streets again.

904
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,665
Drive to "T intersection.

905
00:55:46,826 --> 00:55:48,018
Are you okay?

906
00:55:48,028 --> 00:55:49,321
Can you hear me?

907
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:53,133
Yes, I'm okay.

908
00:55:53,584 --> 00:55:57,999
Well I drive to downtown
via West Burn, okay?

909
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:02,020
It's a ghost town Well.

910
00:56:02,426 --> 00:56:05,362
It is not as we thought
the many more people.

911
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:08,131
I do not know, the people
his death or something.

912
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:09,624
Or changed.

913
00:56:09,634 --> 00:56:11,693
People in groups, alone?

914
00:56:12,203 --> 00:56:13,971
Is everyone up?

915
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:15,145
I wished that I knew it.

916
00:56:15,155 --> 00:56:18,809
I seem the only one who
not infected.

917
00:56:20,398 --> 00:56:22,412
It's like 9-11.

918
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:23,999
It seems.

919
00:56:24,231 --> 00:56:26,232
Yes but 20.

920
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:28,317
I'm outta here.

921
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:30,420
Turn the phone off.

922
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:37,993
Wait, Logan.

923
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:44,324
Hey Logan!

924
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:49,824
If your wife then listening
makes them the door.

925
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:07,609
Oh, dear help!

926
00:57:10,327 --> 00:57:11,795
Gil are you there?

927
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:13,662
Can you hear me?

928
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,476
If you can hear me, please Gil.

929
00:57:19,586 --> 00:57:21,798
I'm okay.

930
00:57:39,874 --> 00:57:43,948
People, the one who listen
and just switch...

931
00:57:43,958 --> 00:57:45,961
We have my live connection to...

932
00:57:46,161 --> 00:57:47,339
My partner Gil...

933
00:57:47,349 --> 00:57:50,767
that 's way through the city.

934
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:53,920
We seek "to restore contact.

935
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,079
So please stay with me.

936
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:58,816
How many men are you
in this building?

937
00:57:58,826 --> 00:58:00,843
I do not know who in
This building is...

938
00:58:00,853 --> 00:58:02,869
We were with four,
I do not know who left?

939
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:05,082
What do you mean, I do not know?

940
00:58:05,182 --> 00:58:08,183
I can not think of
that thing at my head.

941
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,510
Who was with you?

942
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:12,890
One is gone.

943
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:14,975
Maybe two?

944
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:17,384
I hope for you that there are two.

945
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,536
Good evening this is Logan Heart Burn...

946
00:58:19,546 --> 00:58:21,089
what you have in your mind?

947
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:24,640
Logan, I'm 't Vernin.

948
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:28,012
Vernin, it is good to hear your voice.

949
00:58:28,022 --> 00:58:33,099
I remember that I
said one sound.

950
00:58:34,078 --> 00:58:38,147
I had to go. I was right
somebody spied me.

951
00:58:38,148 --> 00:58:40,400
I found it in my living room.

952
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,342
It had to...

953
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:48,201
the FBI or the CIA or something.
- He attacked me.

954
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:54,288
I discovered that she heard us talking.

955
00:58:54,298 --> 00:58:58,437
They must really hate us and may
We do not talk about their secret.

956
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:04,140
Vernin have you watched television?

957
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,471
Have you listened to the show?

958
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:16,349
I was so scared that I
own death and was...

959
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:19,727
They apparently believed that
because they left.

960
00:59:19,737 --> 00:59:21,765
Vernin, this is not something
you think...

961
00:59:21,865 --> 00:59:23,739
something has happened.

962
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:25,110
You're not alone.

963
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,136
I know 't.

964
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:29,800
There are many more
it looks like Big Brother.

965
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:43,999
Logan I do not know whether I
the end of this conversation take?

966
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:49,460
I would tell you that I love them
to listen to you.

967
00:59:49,468 --> 00:59:51,680
There's a reason that you
're number one.

968
00:59:53,456 --> 00:59:55,687
Vernin are you still here?

969
00:59:57,244 --> 01:00:01,245
I can not see...

970
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,542
my eyes are inflamed.

971
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,947
The pricks.

972
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:07,929
My God.

973
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,483
I'm bleeding.
- Vernin, stay with me.

974
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:38,077
We are right back
after this break.

975
01:00:40,534 --> 01:00:42,441
What is this?
- Who are you?

976
01:00:42,541 --> 01:00:45,419
A fan who hijacks your listeners.

977
01:00:46,068 --> 01:00:48,595
What are 't now?

978
01:00:48,695 --> 01:00:49,696
What?

979
01:00:49,697 --> 01:00:53,139
How many listeners are
at this moment?

980
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:54,852
One million per show.

981
01:00:54,952 --> 01:00:58,604
Sometimes more. Tonight
probably many more.

982
01:01:05,963 --> 01:01:07,805
Tonight...

983
01:01:08,499 --> 01:01:10,467
what happens?

984
01:01:10,467 --> 01:01:12,434
You have something to do.

985
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:20,234
I want you to send and
one million listeners that says:

986
01:01:20,544 --> 01:01:23,041
you my phone have been
by Fima.

987
01:01:23,047 --> 01:01:25,806
That 's very important
they go out of their homes...

988
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:27,566
and left town.

989
01:01:27,667 --> 01:01:30,786
That is crazy,
they are much safer inside.

990
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:33,788
The streets are completely...
Yeah, I know 't.

991
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:40,452
But that's what you tell them,
you should tell them.

992
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:44,358
It would just 's nuclear explosion
take place in the city.

993
01:01:44,368 --> 01:01:46,321
He is lying.

994
01:01:50,423 --> 01:01:54,780
I lie when I say: I you
shoot her and then...

995
01:01:54,851 --> 01:01:57,280
I have no regret.

996
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,348
Sit.

997
01:02:01,918 --> 01:02:06,623
Go back and tell what broadcasting
I will, otherwise I'll kill your friend.

998
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,692
I want people to their homes.

999
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:12,304
Do not know that I am present.

1000
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,999
Everyone...

1001
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,399
I got a message from
my producer and...

1002
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,799
as terrible as the evening
is...

1003
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,899
Now we are worried...

1004
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:37,099
because a nuclear device
that is activated...

1005
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:40,399
and is set to explode...

1006
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:44,999
at an unknown location somewhere
in the city.

1007
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:49,174
You think I'm stupid?

1008
01:02:50,693 --> 01:02:53,904
Do it otherwise I'll do it myself.

1009
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:02,024
I want you to blame the Muslims
gives...

1010
01:03:02,203 --> 01:03:04,282
for everything.

1011
01:03:04,393 --> 01:03:06,782
I would hate to have your say.

1012
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,751
This is nonsense Logan.

1013
01:03:09,052 --> 01:03:10,110
What?

1014
01:03:12,238 --> 01:03:15,925
I want you to Muslims
framed.

1015
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:17,438
Doe 't.

1016
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:25,494
Thank you, you,
left off with us.

1017
01:03:26,236 --> 01:03:31,440
We should not just watch
for 10,000 maniacs...

1018
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:33,999
who run around in the streets
in the center.

1019
01:03:35,445 --> 01:03:40,446
There is also a:
potential nuclear threat.

1020
01:03:41,017 --> 01:03:43,220
This is the first to report.

1021
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:47,312
But it seems to Muslim terrorism.

1022
01:03:47,322 --> 01:03:49,347
Look. I take that back.

1023
01:03:49,426 --> 01:03:52,809
There is nothing that it did not seem
it is the Muslims.

1024
01:03:52,819 --> 01:03:54,806
Who else could it be?

1025
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:57,299
That headscarves with camel jockeys.

1026
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:02,199
They are responsible for
all terror since 11/09/2001.

1027
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:04,366
And damn, many
longer than that.

1028
01:04:04,676 --> 01:04:09,328
Can anyone remember his own
that no terrorism...

1029
01:04:09,338 --> 01:04:13,200
fucking shit out of catastrophic
Middle East arrived.

1030
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,201
Take your pick. You...

1031
01:04:15,202 --> 01:04:16,213
Ilatola...

1032
01:04:16,214 --> 01:04:17,225
Bin Laden...

1033
01:04:17,226 --> 01:04:18,237
Sedat...

1034
01:04:18,237 --> 01:04:19,248
Sadam...

1035
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:20,288
Arafat...

1036
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:21,300
Chechen rebels...

1037
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:23,000
Suicides.

1038
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,001
Damn you can
people do not have a hobby...

1039
01:04:26,001 --> 01:04:28,400
which one would not die
ends in the street?

1040
01:04:28,401 --> 01:04:30,400
We live in a new era
people...

1041
01:04:30,401 --> 01:04:34,400
anthrax is for wimps
we are now long gone.

1042
01:04:34,401 --> 01:04:36,402
These are toys for big boys.

1043
01:04:36,601 --> 01:04:43,619
We'll have another short break
and we are back after after... nothing.

1044
01:04:43,729 --> 01:04:46,383
I have no complaints.

1045
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:49,021
Please stay with us?

1046
01:04:51,813 --> 01:04:53,802
Very good.

1047
01:04:54,406 --> 01:04:56,518
That would 't do.

1048
01:04:58,599 --> 01:05:00,721
Why the Muslims?

1049
01:05:05,385 --> 01:05:07,227
Anger, hatred.

1050
01:05:07,577 --> 01:05:09,698
You turns you against your own people.

1051
01:05:09,874 --> 01:05:12,170
You make fire...

1052
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:14,253
you should also sit on the blisters.

1053
01:05:14,263 --> 01:05:18,250
Same as politics.

1054
01:05:19,456 --> 01:05:21,457
Yet seven hours to go.

1055
01:05:21,949 --> 01:05:25,801
Continue with what
using 't doing.

1056
01:05:26,142 --> 01:05:29,125
When a call comes...

1057
01:05:29,135 --> 01:05:32,346
Let you not notice that:
I'm here.

1058
01:05:39,722 --> 01:05:42,243
Thank you still with us.

1059
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:47,466
Excuse for this
psychotic break.

1060
01:05:47,476 --> 01:05:52,328
This is not my typical
show tonight.

1061
01:05:53,737 --> 01:05:55,988
We begin this evening with...

1062
01:05:56,017 --> 01:06:00,575
the subject paranoia.

1063
01:06:00,675 --> 01:06:04,626
How appropriate is it for now.

1064
01:06:08,792 --> 01:06:10,793
The lines are open.

1065
01:06:10,871 --> 01:06:13,060
You are in the broadcast.

1066
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:15,219
I'm Logan 's Gaby.

1067
01:06:15,229 --> 01:06:18,888
Thank God, all right?
Are you safe treasure? Yes.

1068
01:06:18,988 --> 01:06:21,067
Did Gil 't taken to the house?

1069
01:06:21,067 --> 01:06:22,546
Would he come here?

1070
01:06:22,546 --> 01:06:24,388
Logan what is going on?

1071
01:06:24,498 --> 01:06:26,739
I returned to your show
After I heard your message.

1072
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:28,990
Why do you say those things
about Muslims?

1073
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:35,983
Sometimes the hard truth and to
Some things are said.

1074
01:06:36,093 --> 01:06:38,028
I know you do not believe.

1075
01:06:39,696 --> 01:06:40,822
Didi is in order?

1076
01:06:40,822 --> 01:06:41,838
She is okay.

1077
01:06:41,848 --> 01:06:44,390

these things?

1078
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,959
Honey I must tell you something:

1079
01:06:47,069 --> 01:06:49,232

Gaby are you still here?

1082
01:06:52,892 --> 01:06:54,993

01:07:02,012 --> 01:07:03,331

1086
01:07:03,432 --> 01:07:05,251

Another lie to panic

Everything is true.

1100
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:16,018
Here we focus on...

1101
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:19,087
spreading hatred
in the right direction.

1102
01:09:19,188 --> 01:09:21,380
People interested in hate

01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:23,522
they try to survive, moron.

1104
01:09:23,532 --> 01:09:24,966
You have a big mouth.

01:09:25,076 --> 01:09:27,395
About seven hours is...

1106
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:29,915
a dead man's family

Your Nation designs new diseases,

Always new ways to

1111
01:09:42,112 --> 01:09:46,407
You think a man with my bomb this
gun holds no virus can make?

1112
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:50,786
Make an announcement.

1113
01:09:50,787 --> 01:09:54,518
People need to know
Who created this hell.

1114
01:09:57,157 --> 01:09:58,368
Doe 't.

1115
01:10:07,187 --> 01:10:09,172

Sit! Before I kill you.

1118
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:23,509
Do that again and you
brains are against the wall.

1119
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:24,520
Sit!

1120
01:10:26,253 --> 01:10:27,709

01:10:34,453 --> 01:10:35,652
You have destroyed my serum.

1126
01:10:35,653 --> 01:10:37,640
I need that vaccine?

1127
01:10:37,842 --> 01:10:40,126
Where did they at all
require.

1128
01:10:40,136 --> 01:10:41,227
They can care for one another.

1129
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:42,238
Wait.

1130
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:43,570
I 's serum for you.

1131
01:10:43,670 --> 01:10:47,669
Below is our account...

1132
01:10:47,717 --> 01:10:50,928

1133
01:10:53,365 --> 01:10:55,786
You go. Arise!

1134
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:09,479
Take the stairs. Go!

I kill her and get your search.

1137
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:17,706
I'm back within five.

1138
01:11:20,992 --> 01:11:23,103
Is water anywhere?

1139
01:11:23,113 --> 01:11:25,532
My God, your eyes!

1140
01:11:25,633 --> 01:11:27,634
I need water?

1141
01:11:28,843 --> 01:11:33,794
The pantry is here by the door.

1142
01:11:46,567 --> 01:11:49,689
You change into some thing,
is not it?

1143
01:11:55,043 --> 01:11:57,412
I am exposed

1144
01:11:57,413 --> 01:11:59,347
The serum that will change.

1145
01:11:59,781 --> 01:12:01,806
How long do you have?

1146
01:12:02,476 --> 01:12:05,999
Now you 're a researcher and reporter?

1147
01:12:06,372 --> 01:12:09,857
I did not wait for the press
to say what I think.

1148
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:12,026
I did the important news
for six years.

1149
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:17,198
Your important news
is about how celebrities recover.

1150
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:20,509
What does your body language on the news?

1151
01:12:20,619 --> 01:12:24,540
Where is the American media
with my report as a...

1152
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:27,851
bombing of Lebanese children
that night was?

1153
01:12:27,961 --> 01:12:32,464
Where are they like Osama Bin Laden
receives his salary from the CIA?

1154
01:12:32,574 --> 01:12:35,666
So Osama Bin Laden is not
bad enough for you?

1155
01:12:35,676 --> 01:12:39,435
Osama Bin Laden is your Santa Claus.

1156
01:12:39,435 --> 01:12:42,089
Lying to a bunch of kids.

1157
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:20,811
So what happens after seven hours?

1158
01:13:20,811 --> 01:13:26,999
In seven hours does' t virus
prevailed and you are infected...

1159
01:13:27,001 --> 01:13:29,364
and you will fall down dead
and then you will be destroyed...

1160
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:31,105
and then it's over.

1161
01:13:31,205 --> 01:13:38,204
There is no global scourge is just
enough for a city to destroy.

1162
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:43,248
Tell every man, woman and child.

1163
01:13:45,517 --> 01:13:50,035
As if it was intended
sick of your government.

1164
01:13:50,135 --> 01:13:51,844
If you hate government so...

1165
01:13:51,944 --> 01:13:53,652
Why do you lose 't
American people think of?

1166
01:13:53,652 --> 01:13:56,670
Your people and government
are 't the same.

1167
01:13:56,670 --> 01:13:58,771
So lock in your people.

1168
01:14:22,288 --> 01:14:24,335
Shit! What are you doing here?

1169
01:14:24,335 --> 01:14:26,394

01:14:28,253 --> 01:14:30,044
Have you heard

1172
01:14:30,054 --> 01:14:31,055
Stop.

1173
01:14:31,056 --> 01:14:32,057
I know 't.

1174
01:14:32,058 --> 01:14:33,059
I know everything.

1175
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:34,419
Look there's a top score.

1176
01:14:34,429 --> 01:14:36,740
He has a gun and Lucy.

1177
01:14:36,988 --> 01:14:38,599
You can help. No.

1178
01:14:38,601 --> 01:14:39,995

1179
01:14:40,405 --> 01:14:41,464

1182
01:15:47,736 --> 01:15:49,362
Everything is good.

1183
01:16:00,906 --> 01:16:03,017
What you ask is my command.

1184
01:16:12,935 --> 01:16:14,626
Come on the move.

1185
01:16:34,398 --> 01:16:35,401

1186
01:16:35,491 --> 01:16:37,592
I come... but not alone.

1187
01:16:42,429 --> 01:16:43,530
Stop!

1188
01:16:44,499 --> 01:16:45,620
No.

1189
01:17:17,231 --> 01:17:18,332
Serum.

1190
01:17:18,412 --> 01:17:19,523
Give it up to me.

1191
01:17:19,892 --> 01:17:21,103
Hurry!

1192
01:17:30,443 --> 01:17:31,654
Are you okay?

1193
01:17:34,682 --> 01:17:36,708
What?
You gonna shoot us now?

1194
01:17:36,718 --> 01:17:38,979

I just saved your life asshole.

1196
01:17:41,859 --> 01:17:43,087
You know what your problem is?

1197
01:17:43,835 --> 01:17:45,412
You give nothing for nothing.

1198
01:17:45,612 --> 01:17:47,878
It is much talk talk talk.

1199
01:17:47,988 --> 01:17:48,999
Shooting your gun into the air.

1200
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:50,499
The burning of flags.

1201
01:17:50,941 --> 01:17:52,942
You're the one
who blame the country.

1202
01:17:53,606 --> 01:17:54,928
But what actually is the cause...

1203
01:17:55,038 --> 01:17:56,471
you love killing.

1204
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:57,666
It feeds you.

1205
01:17:57,776 --> 01:17:58,982
Gives you strength.

1206
01:17:59,082 --> 01:18:00,957
Makes you a man.

1207
01:18:40,515 --> 01:18:42,380
Are you okay?

1208
01:18:42,417 --> 01:18:43,418
Yes.

1209
01:18:44,352 --> 01:18:45,894

1212
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:55,471
Not moving.

1213
01:18:55,915 --> 01:18:57,457
I want to be together again.

1214
01:18:57,608 --> 01:18:59,101
We seek him.

1215
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:01,462
Stay with me Logan.

1216
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:08,273
All listeners, good morning.

1217
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:10,177
They are just flying.

1218
01:19:10,278 --> 01:19:12,479
There are six or eight of my house.

1219
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:16,475
I'm so tired.

1220
01:19:17,415 --> 01:19:20,322
People: This is your host
Logan Heart Burn...

1221
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:22,520
and we are almost done here.

1222
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:25,557
It will probably
a few days but...

1223
01:19:25,567 --> 01:19:28,728
We have...

1224
01:19:28,738 --> 01:19:31,099

1225
01:19:31,109 --> 01:19:33,056

1226
01:19:33,156 --> 01:19:36,204

01:19:36,204 --> 01:19:38,402
For 't listen.

1228

You vote.

1229
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,388
And it most especially...

1230
01:19:42,498 --> 01:19:44,500
for us to help...

1231
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,041
and helping each other.

1232
01:19:57,136 --> 01:19:59,484
You say you were a antiserum have?

1233
01:19:59,884 --> 01:20:00,985
Yes.

1234
01:20:02,558 --> 01:20:04,495
Join me in the back.

1235
01:20:04,595 --> 01:20:08,000
So what happens after seven hours?
- Here.

1236
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,998
About seven hours, the
virus prevail...

1237
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:17,199
and will be effective and will kill you
fall down and destroy you...

1238
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:18,668
and then it's over.

1239
01:20:18,778 --> 01:20:19,999
You hate the government...

1240
01:20:20,052 --> 01:20:22,846
you must not
American people attacked.

1241
01:20:22,876 --> 01:20:25,877
The virus was designed by the USA

1242
01:20:27,476 --> 01:20:28,521
You saw 't.

1243
01:20:28,525 --> 01:20:29,999
I want clarity?

1244
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,224
Have you heard or seen?

1245
01:20:34,974 --> 01:20:38,942
I would like to hide but...

1246
01:20:43,321 --> 01:20:45,585
I think this is my resignation.

1247
01:20:45,895 --> 01:20:49,449
My producer is left now
the world relief organization.

1248
01:20:49,469 --> 01:20:51,743
All our hope is to her...

1249
01:20:51,743 --> 01:20:53,489
something that they think of 'n....

1250
01:20:53,517 --> 01:20:55,629
solution for this virus.

1251
01:20:58,866 --> 01:21:01,409
At this moment, I just
but my family.

1252
01:21:31,404 --> 01:21:33,256
Gaby?

1253
01:21:33,748 --> 01:21:35,600
Gil?

1254
01:24:48,399 --> 01:24:49,920
Gaby?

1255
01:25:09,708 --> 01:25:12,449
I'm so glad you're okay.

1256
01:25:18,326 --> 01:25:20,384
10,000 years...

1257
01:25:20,384 --> 01:25:21,963
in the history of mankind.

1258
01:25:21,963 --> 01:25:23,842
Millions of years of evolution...

1259
01:25:24,243 --> 01:25:26,272
and still we are building something...

1260
01:25:26,272 --> 01:25:28,699
what more to destroy
than to create.

1261
01:25:29,145 --> 01:25:31,181
That circle of inventions...

1262
01:25:31,281 --> 01:25:32,999
A knife for the community...

1263
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,017
literally a knife.

1264
01:25:34,018 --> 01:25:36,047
And not just a community...

1265
01:25:36,047 --> 01:25:37,376
but humanity.

1266
01:25:37,577 --> 01:25:39,606
We are all victims...

1267
01:25:39,606 --> 01:25:41,728
the same terrible impulses.

1268
01:25:41,938 --> 01:25:44,097
And we show how to find...

1269
01:25:44,198 --> 01:25:46,967
to store and recharge our energy
into something positive...

1270
01:25:47,058 --> 01:25:49,499
