1
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:46,103
Zeus.

2
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,410
Poseidon.

3
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,480
It's been many years.

4
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,250
What do you see?

5
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,170
Thunderclouds.

6
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,330
But no lightning.

7
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,610
Stolen.

8
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,309
What?

9
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,700
Do you think I took it?

10
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:24,010
Omnipotence has blinded, brother.

11
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,870
We are forbidden from stealing
each other's powers.

12
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,600
But our children aren't.

13
00:03:32,144 --> 00:03:33,590
You're accusing my son?

14
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,349
I haven't seen him
since he was a baby.

15
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,260
He doesn't know me or even know
who he is, because of you.

16
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,130
If your son is the thief,

17
00:03:43,252 --> 00:03:45,430
I will send him to the
depths of Tartarus.

18
00:03:46,672 --> 00:03:50,920
If you touch him, you will
have the fight of your life.

19
00:03:55,065 --> 00:03:56,990
He must return the bolt to me,

20
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,350
in 14 days, by midnight
in the summer solstice.

21
00:04:09,506 --> 00:04:11,220
Or there will be war.

22
00:05:50,068 --> 00:05:51,420
And he's alive.

23
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:59,760
Percy Jackson is a beast.
You're a beast, man.

24
00:06:01,024 --> 00:06:03,150
- How long was it?
- Seven minutes.

25
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,080
- Seven minutes?
- Uh hmmm.

26
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,580
That's crazy, man, that's
ridiculous. How do you do it?

27
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,190
I just like being in the water.

28
00:06:11,863 --> 00:06:13,390
It's the only place
I can think.

29
00:06:27,276 --> 00:06:29,490
I wish I could spend all day in
the water instead of this place.

30
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,140
Right, like high school without the musical.

31
00:06:33,564 --> 00:06:35,060
Every day is the same thing.

32
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,040
Good morning, I'm Ms. Dodds.

33
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,120
The substitute English teacher.

34
00:06:49,907 --> 00:06:51,530
Would someone please
explain what Shakespeare

35
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,530
was trying to convey
in this line from Othello?

36
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,700
Percy Jackson.

37
00:07:04,577 --> 00:07:06,264
Well...

38
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,780
I'm sorry, I don't know.

39
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,440
Anybody else?

40
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,260
- Mom, I'm home.
- I'm up here, honey.

41
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,769
- Hi
- Hey, Mom.

42
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,140
- How was school today?
- The usual.

43
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,530
This dyslexia thing
is getting worse.

44
00:07:54,844 --> 00:07:56,405
Why do you think that?

45
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,790
I don't know, maybe it's the ADHD.

46
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,600
I thought this school was
suppose to make things better.

47
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,770
Percy, I know how hard
this is for you.

48
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,670
But someday, it will
all make sense.

49
00:08:11,554 --> 00:08:12,928
Really?

50
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,500
When?

51
00:08:15,706 --> 00:08:17,710
Tonight? Tomorrow? When?

52
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,100
Woman.

53
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,460
Hi, Gabe.

54
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,480
Where's my beer?

55
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,500
It's in the fridge.

56
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,860
So what, it's suppose to magically
float from the ice box and into my hand.

57
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,690
Oh come on, man.
You could do that right here?

58
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,980
It's disgusting, we're in the kitchen.

59
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,500
Yeah, real charming
you got that.

60
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,230
Show some respect.

61
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,020
That's my mom, right there.

62
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,610
This is my house.

63
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,460
You show some respect.

64
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,800
Why do you stay with that pig?
He smells like a sewer.

65
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,950
He sleeps till noon everyday,
and he can't even hold a job.

66
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,410
Why do you stay with him?

67
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,000
He's been good to us, Percy
in ways you don't understand.

68
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,000
You're right, I don't understand.
I don't get it.

69
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:59,210
Be prepared, everything
is about to change, Percy.

70
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,660
Everything is about to change ...

71
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,150
There are 12 Olympian gods.

72
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:19,310
The big three are the brothers
Zeus, Poseidon and Hades.

73
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,221
They attained the power by
overthrowing their father,  Kronos,

74
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,836
chopping him into little pieces.

75
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,994
The three gods have been rivals ever since.

76
00:10:33,022 --> 00:10:37,127
Always arguing, always
threatening war.

77
00:10:38,218 --> 00:10:40,860
On several occasions,
they would come down to Earth

78
00:10:41,468 --> 00:10:44,454
And, uhmm, how shall I put this?

79
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,626
Hook up?

80
00:10:48,003 --> 00:10:50,217
They would hook up with mortals.

81
00:10:50,652 --> 00:10:55,144
The children produced
were half god, half human.

82
00:10:56,206 --> 00:10:58,543
Can anyone what
they were called?

83
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,665
Percy?

84
00:11:03,891 --> 00:11:05,766
I'm sorry, what, Mr. Brunner?

85
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:12,729
What is the proper name of the
offspring of a human and a god?

86
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:17,132
- Demigod.
- Exactly.

87
00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:23,481
Many have been great heroes.
Like Hercules and Achilles.

88
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:27,543
Can you name another?

89
00:11:30,395 --> 00:11:31,761
I'll give you a hint.

90
00:11:32,638 --> 00:11:34,429
You have something in common.

91
00:11:45,028 --> 00:11:49,809
Percy ... Perseus?

92
00:11:53,118 --> 00:11:54,472
Correct.

93
00:11:56,554 --> 00:11:59,401
Now over here, we have
a depiction of Hercules

94
00:11:59,402 --> 00:12:01,261
defeating the Nemean lion.

95
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:06,309
Hercules killed the beast
with his bare hands

96
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,462
and he took the skin as trophy.

97
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:12,552
- Percy ...
- Yes, Ms. Dodds?

98
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:14,654
We need to talk.

99
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:33,698
So did I do something wrong?

100
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:37,639
Ms. Dodds?

101
00:12:38,683 --> 00:12:40,009
Hello?

102
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,124
Where is it?

103
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:47,596
How did you get up there?

104
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,578
You stole the lightning bolt!

105
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:01,466
- I don't know what you're talking about!
- Give it to me!

106
00:13:03,444 --> 00:13:06,823
Give it to me now!

107
00:13:08,993 --> 00:13:10,299
Percy!

108
00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:12,883
Release him!

109
00:13:13,157 --> 00:13:14,457
You ...

110
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:18,449
Release him or I swear
I'll tear you to pieces.

111
00:13:31,121 --> 00:13:33,959
I'm going crazy.
I should be on vacation.

112
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,863
Percy, calm down.
Everything's gonna be okay.

113
00:13:36,328 --> 00:13:40,359
Oh God, wait.
Did that really just happen?

114
00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:42,350
She's turned to that thing?

115
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:43,834
A fury.

116
00:13:44,251 --> 00:13:46,829
Concealed in our school,
I should have known.

117
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,446
Wait, wait. A fury? What is a fury?

118
00:13:49,565 --> 00:13:51,437
And why did you say
you could tear her to pieces?

119
00:13:51,528 --> 00:13:52,867
What did she want from you?

120
00:13:53,623 --> 00:13:55,853
She ... said something ...

121
00:13:56,943 --> 00:13:58,311
about me ...

122
00:13:58,985 --> 00:14:00,666
stealing a lightning bolt.

123
00:14:01,582 --> 00:14:02,946
They've found him.

124
00:14:06,404 --> 00:14:08,310
- He's in danger.
- Who found me?

125
00:14:09,156 --> 00:14:10,941
- He's no longer safe here.
-  Okay, where should we move him?

126
00:14:10,942 --> 00:14:12,559
We have no choice, the camp.

127
00:14:13,016 --> 00:14:15,164
What camp? Look, I'm standing right here.

128
00:14:15,165 --> 00:14:16,894
If they think he's the thief,

129
00:14:17,111 --> 00:14:19,315
there's nowhere safe from
heaven and earth for him now

130
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,676
Percy.

131
00:14:20,884 --> 00:14:24,421
Take this to defend yourself.
It's a powerful weapon.

132
00:14:25,011 --> 00:14:30,067
Guard it well.
Only use it in times of severe distress.

133
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:33,447
This is a pen.

134
00:14:33,675 --> 00:14:35,330
This is a pen!

135
00:14:35,331 --> 00:14:38,607
Take him to his mother.
And don't let him out of your sight.

136
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,848
Percy, come on.
Come on, man, come on!

137
00:14:47,267 --> 00:14:48,651
What's going on?

138
00:14:49,434 --> 00:14:50,792
Don't trust anyone, okay.

139
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,081
Don't look at anybody,
just keep walking.

140
00:14:53,082 --> 00:14:55,484
Why did Mr. Brunner
ask you to watch me?

141
00:14:55,485 --> 00:14:57,163
- Because I'm your protector.
- Wait, hang on.

142
00:14:57,164 --> 00:14:58,765
My protector? Are you kidding?

143
00:14:59,727 --> 00:15:02,552
What? You think because I'm
like this I'm not capable of keeping you safe?

144
00:15:02,587 --> 00:15:04,380
Maybe you're not seeing
what I'm seeing.

145
00:15:04,381 --> 00:15:06,013
You have crutches.

146
00:15:06,014 --> 00:15:07,674
Look, I will give my life
to secure your well-being.

147
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:09,682
What are you talking about?
What's going on?

148
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:11,233
We gotta warn your mom.

149
00:15:11,696 --> 00:15:14,412
Come on, Percy. Come on.

150
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,486
Sally! More beer!

151
00:15:20,261 --> 00:15:21,812
Look, we gotta talk, okay.

152
00:15:23,229 --> 00:15:25,703
Can't you see she's servicing
me and my friends?

153
00:15:26,424 --> 00:15:29,165
Hey, hey, don't talk about my mom
like that, you bald-headed freak.

154
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:40,239
- Nice one.
- Like I said, I'm your protector.

155
00:15:42,614 --> 00:15:46,026
Sally, Percy has to leave now.
Like right now.

156
00:15:53,408 --> 00:15:54,806
What is happening?

157
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,384
- Okay, I swear I didn't steal anything.
- Honey, I believe you. I believe you.

158
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,226
Where are you taking me?
What is this camp?

159
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:06,811
It's a camp for really special
people like you.

160
00:16:06,812 --> 00:16:10,262
Special people, what, am I
crazy or something?

161
00:16:10,615 --> 00:16:12,233
No, honey, no.

162
00:16:13,124 --> 00:16:14,973
Percy, this is about your father.

163
00:16:26,047 --> 00:16:28,583
Your father was unlike
any guy you've ever seen...

164
00:16:28,584 --> 00:16:31,012
he was just dazzling.

165
00:16:31,338 --> 00:16:33,074
Now he's dazzling?

166
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:39,742
And then you came along
and then it was just perfect.

167
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:42,609
But he had to leave.

168
00:16:43,606 --> 00:16:45,733
So he did abandon us.

169
00:16:46,344 --> 00:16:49,127
No, honey.
He was forced to. He loved you.

170
00:16:50,314 --> 00:16:53,883
Leaving you, it was probably the
most difficult thing he ever did.

171
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,623
Why did he had to go?

172
00:17:07,718 --> 00:17:10,305
- Because he's ...
- Sally, watch out!

173
00:17:20,485 --> 00:17:22,947
- Percy!
- Mom, are you alright?

174
00:17:23,653 --> 00:17:24,977
Grover, are you alright?

175
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,143
Is it me or is it raining cows?

176
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,792
What is that?

177
00:17:35,793 --> 00:17:38,645
Get out! Come on!

178
00:17:39,084 --> 00:17:41,364
Why are you taking your pants off?
What are you doing?

179
00:17:41,365 --> 00:17:42,791
My job.

180
00:17:42,826 --> 00:17:44,564
Whoa, whoa.
You're half doggie?

181
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:46,451
I'm half goat.

182
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:55,080
Watch out.
There's glass.

183
00:17:55,989 --> 00:17:58,445
Come on, get out of the
car, that thing's getting closer!

184
00:17:58,905 --> 00:18:01,671
- Do you ever need these?
- It's just for show.

185
00:18:01,806 --> 00:18:03,171
Follow me!

186
00:18:07,731 --> 00:18:09,829
This way, guys. This way.

187
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:13,293
Come on! Come on!
Run! Run!

188
00:18:13,294 --> 00:18:15,034
Go, go!

189
00:18:28,058 --> 00:18:29,792
Come on!

190
00:18:34,484 --> 00:18:35,806
We're here.

191
00:18:42,866 --> 00:18:44,485
Grover!

192
00:18:46,753 --> 00:18:48,570
Mom, what are you doing?

193
00:18:48,571 --> 00:18:49,957
This is as far as I can get.

194
00:18:50,246 --> 00:18:52,877
I can't go through,
I'm not like you.

195
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:55,928
- I'm not leaving without you.
- You have to!

196
00:18:56,556 --> 00:18:57,880
You have to.

197
00:19:05,013 --> 00:19:06,923
Put my mother down!

198
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:10,007
Percy, go!
You're safe inside the gate.

199
00:19:10,008 --> 00:19:12,054
- What can I do?
- Use the pen!

200
00:19:12,055 --> 00:19:14,091
- What?
- Use Brunner's pen and click it.

201
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,723
Is everything okay?

202
00:19:51,307 --> 00:19:52,862
Percy, behind you!

203
00:20:07,077 --> 00:20:09,030
- Percy, are you okay?
- I'm not feeling...

204
00:20:09,165 --> 00:20:10,473
Percy!

205
00:20:36,252 --> 00:20:39,353
- It hurts.
- I'm sure glad you're alive.

206
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:54,976
Where am I? What is this place?

207
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,934
The infirmary. You've been
unconscious for three days.

208
00:20:58,218 --> 00:20:59,716
Three days?

209
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:02,707
So, Percy.

210
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:04,993
What do you remember?

211
00:21:05,977 --> 00:21:08,547
Some crazy dream.

212
00:21:08,548 --> 00:21:10,682
There was a monster.

213
00:21:10,995 --> 00:21:13,368
My mom was there,
you were there too.

214
00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:16,607
You were some weird hybrid
man-goat thing, whoa.

215
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:23,357
Put it in the correct term, it's satyr.

216
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,447
All of it was real?

217
00:21:31,731 --> 00:21:33,183
My mom was gone?

218
00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:37,914
I'm sorry, Percy.
I tried, man, I really do.

219
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,622
But frankly, I'm just
a junior protector.

220
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,380
I don't have horns yet.

221
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:46,024
It's my fault.

222
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:47,855
It was my job to protect you.

223
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:50,005
Both of you.

224
00:22:00,701 --> 00:22:03,365
So, this is Camp Half-Blood.

225
00:22:03,366 --> 00:22:06,163
- What do you mean, what?
- I think you know.

226
00:22:06,814 --> 00:22:08,498
Half mean, half mortal, half god.

227
00:22:08,665 --> 00:22:11,346
- Fire!
- Oh guys, watch the arrows!

228
00:22:12,094 --> 00:22:14,939
Newcomer, hello.

229
00:22:15,546 --> 00:22:18,318
Look, man. Remember all the myths
about great gods and goddesses.

230
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:21,091
Well, they're not myths.

231
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,770
Remember what Mr. Brunner said.
Sometimes...

232
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,110
they come down to Earth
and they fall in love with mortals.

233
00:22:26,406 --> 00:22:28,495
And they'll have kids.

234
00:22:29,234 --> 00:22:31,046
- No way.
- Yes way.

235
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:34,116
Yup, you're a demigod.

236
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:36,231
Two points for Percy Jackson!

237
00:22:38,447 --> 00:22:40,858
Don't worry, but you're not alone.
There's hundreds in the world.

238
00:22:41,351 --> 00:22:42,695
Some live normal lives.

239
00:22:43,072 --> 00:22:45,712
And some, I'm not allowed to
vulgar names are very famous.

240
00:22:46,072 --> 00:22:47,746
I'm talking about like
White House famous.

241
00:22:49,191 --> 00:22:52,579
See man, this place right here. This is the place
where you learn to harness your powers.

242
00:22:53,268 --> 00:22:56,550
You train to become leaders,
warriors and heroes.

243
00:22:57,097 --> 00:22:58,985
I think you have the wrong guy.

244
00:22:59,351 --> 00:23:01,367
I'm not a hero, I'm a loser.

245
00:23:01,396 --> 00:23:03,146
I have dyslexia and ADHD.

246
00:23:03,713 --> 00:23:05,236
And those are your
greatest gifts.

247
00:23:06,526 --> 00:23:08,735
If you kinda read,
the words float off the page, right?

248
00:23:09,245 --> 00:23:12,437
That's because your brain's hotwired
for ancient Greek and not English.

249
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:16,022
- Right. At the museum I can read.
- Yeah.

250
00:23:16,032 --> 00:23:17,617
And your ADHD...

251
00:23:19,188 --> 00:23:22,077
You're impulsive, Percy.
You can't be still!

252
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,973
Those are your natural battle reflexes, man.

253
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,236
They kept you alive
in your fight.

254
00:23:28,098 --> 00:23:31,343
Look, no pitiful loser
can defeat a Minotaur.

255
00:23:32,627 --> 00:23:36,022
Your blood is special.
It's the blood of a god.

256
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,273
That's a lot to process.

257
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,981
A lot. A lot.

258
00:23:46,501 --> 00:23:48,645
This is where you'll do most
of your battle training.

259
00:24:03,357 --> 00:24:04,690
What's her name?

260
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:10,229
- She will squash you like a bug.
- Her name?

261
00:24:10,714 --> 00:24:13,901
Annabeth. Daughter of
Athena, the goddess of wisdom.

262
00:24:19,337 --> 00:24:21,116
Hey, no staring.
Keep it moving.

263
00:24:21,474 --> 00:24:22,778
Come on, come on.

264
00:24:26,377 --> 00:24:29,350
There's someone I want
you to see. Check this out.

265
00:24:43,128 --> 00:24:45,918
- What are those things?
- The centaurs.

266
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:51,840
- Wait, is that Mr. Brunner?
- Come on.

267
00:24:59,403 --> 00:25:00,740
Mr. Brunner?

268
00:25:01,414 --> 00:25:04,356
In my world, I'm
known as Chiron.

269
00:25:05,758 --> 00:25:08,443
- Are you recovered?
- Am I recovered?

270
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:11,055
You, you're not in a wheelchair.

271
00:25:11,095 --> 00:25:15,034
- You have ...
- A real horse's ass.

272
00:25:16,194 --> 00:25:17,931
I apologize for hiding
my true form,

273
00:25:17,941 --> 00:25:19,482
but I needed to keep an eye on you.

274
00:25:20,536 --> 00:25:23,478
I hope you'll forgive me. Come.

275
00:25:36,738 --> 00:25:40,108
Grover! Grover, come here!

276
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,820
Daughters of Aphrodite.

277
00:25:43,612 --> 00:25:46,208
Alright, guys. You guys
got a lot of catching up to do.

278
00:25:46,424 --> 00:25:48,908
Their mother is the goddess of love.
Let's see where that leads.

279
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:53,280
- Hey, baby!
- Satyrs ...

280
00:25:56,082 --> 00:25:57,469
What is this place?

281
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:02,298
Welcome home.
His father built this.

282
00:26:02,824 --> 00:26:04,136
For you.

283
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:16,980
This whole place is mine?

284
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,376
I think it has some weight to it.

285
00:26:41,273 --> 00:26:45,101
- My father is Poseidon.
- God of the seas.

286
00:26:45,924 --> 00:26:47,363
Why didn't anybody tell me?

287
00:26:48,396 --> 00:26:49,777
It was for your own safety.

288
00:26:51,755 --> 00:26:55,684
It's extremely rare for a child
to be born to one of the big three.

289
00:26:58,053 --> 00:27:01,356
They're very powerful.
A threat.

290
00:27:02,025 --> 00:27:04,268
A threat?
Who am I threatening?

291
00:27:05,976 --> 00:27:10,156
Poseidon's brothers.
Zeus and Hades.

292
00:27:12,344 --> 00:27:14,951
That's why your mother
married your stepfather.

293
00:27:15,532 --> 00:27:18,634
His pungent odor masked
the smell of your blood.

294
00:27:19,886 --> 00:27:23,637
And hid you from
anything or anyone

295
00:27:23,747 --> 00:27:25,379
that gods have sent to kill you.

296
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:29,619
My mother put up with
that creep to protect me?

297
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,387
I wish I've known...

298
00:27:37,528 --> 00:27:39,933
She sacrificed so much for me.

299
00:27:43,813 --> 00:27:45,244
Now she's gone.

300
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:56,638
- Why am I even here?
- You're here because you're in jeopardy.

301
00:27:57,446 --> 00:27:59,206
Everyone thinks you're
the lightning thief.

302
00:28:00,107 --> 00:28:01,499
Look, I didn't steal it.

303
00:28:05,848 --> 00:28:09,217
Zeus' bolt is the most powerful
weapon ever created.

304
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,781
And if it's not returned by
summer solstice

305
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:16,875
- In ten days, there will be a war.
- This is your problem, alright, not mine.

306
00:28:17,145 --> 00:28:18,755
This is about your world not mine.

307
00:28:18,765 --> 00:28:20,738
This is about all worlds.

308
00:28:22,692 --> 00:28:24,579
The Olympians would be
forced to choose sides,

309
00:28:24,645 --> 00:28:26,321
Earth would become
a battleground.

310
00:28:26,646 --> 00:28:29,785
Mountains erupting,
earthquakes, raging fires!

311
00:28:30,535 --> 00:28:32,785
The end of life as you know it.

312
00:28:38,339 --> 00:28:39,644
What can we do?

313
00:28:40,036 --> 00:28:44,028
I want to take you to Olympus.
Convince Zeus of your innocence.

314
00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:47,345
Someone's using you
to start a war.

315
00:28:49,531 --> 00:28:51,106
What are we doing here? Let's go now.

316
00:28:51,368 --> 00:28:54,471
Your boldness is commendable,
but outside those gates,

317
00:28:54,571 --> 00:28:58,178
you will be in danger
at all times.

318
00:28:59,139 --> 00:29:01,908
The Fury and the Minotaur
were only the beginning.

319
00:29:02,968 --> 00:29:07,528
First, you must train.

320
00:29:12,783 --> 00:29:14,822
This is always a fun
game to watch.

321
00:29:16,162 --> 00:29:18,628
How do you guys wear these stuff?
It weighs more than me!

322
00:29:18,814 --> 00:29:21,764
- Trust me, wear it or you'll get killed.
- Wait, what?

323
00:29:22,735 --> 00:29:24,184
- Wait.
- Heroes!

324
00:29:25,251 --> 00:29:28,538
Warriors! Come on!

325
00:29:33,974 --> 00:29:35,401
Hustle, hassle.

326
00:29:36,082 --> 00:29:38,943
Stop bloody gagging.

327
00:29:41,076 --> 00:29:44,275
Percy, step forward.

328
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:51,446
This is Percy Jackson.

329
00:29:53,345 --> 00:29:54,943
He's gonna need a team.

330
00:29:55,904 --> 00:29:57,225
We'll take him.

331
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:04,516
I'm Luke, son of Hermes
and camp leader.

332
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,765
Not necessarily in that order.

333
00:30:07,446 --> 00:30:10,589
- Where's your helmet?
- No one gave me one.

334
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:16,729
Chiron, you still got your wheelchair?
He's gonna need it.

335
00:30:17,297 --> 00:30:18,675
You're gone here, man.

336
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:23,141
I'm messing with you.
Smile a little bit. It's good for you, kid.

337
00:30:23,665 --> 00:30:26,430
Anybody got an extra helmet?
Please pass it up.

338
00:30:30,698 --> 00:30:32,014
Try it on.

339
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:35,759
That will protect you.
From all of us.

340
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,213
Welcome to the
blue soldiers, my friend.

341
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:42,707
Alright, everyone in position
for capture the flag.

342
00:30:43,267 --> 00:30:46,534
First team to capture
the enemy's banner wins.

343
00:30:47,082 --> 00:30:48,460
Dismissed.

344
00:30:50,006 --> 00:30:53,866
Ready, steady, now!

345
00:31:12,908 --> 00:31:14,577
Percy I know where
the flag is at, come on!

346
00:31:20,103 --> 00:31:22,934
Keep your eyes open and don't get killed.

347
00:31:36,673 --> 00:31:38,005
I'm coming, buddy.
I'm coming.

348
00:31:38,274 --> 00:31:39,647
Sons of Ares. Watch out!

349
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:41,208
Well, that's a sword!
That's a sword!

350
00:31:45,335 --> 00:31:47,371
You guys take camp
way too seriously.

351
00:31:48,421 --> 00:31:49,796
Go!

352
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:06,025
Percy, get out here!
Go look for the flag.

353
00:32:06,308 --> 00:32:07,996
How did I just do that?

354
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,085
I won.

355
00:32:43,363 --> 00:32:45,563
Do you really think it
would be that easy?

356
00:32:51,107 --> 00:32:53,817
My mother is goddess of
wisdom and battle strategy.

357
00:32:54,298 --> 00:32:58,837
Do you know what that means?
I always win.

358
00:32:59,754 --> 00:33:03,003
I always lose.
Maybe we're both wrong.

359
00:33:22,023 --> 00:33:23,491
Hey Chiron, shouldn't we
get there and stop it.

360
00:33:23,726 --> 00:33:25,463
- Coz she's killing him, man.
- You gotta be kidding.

361
00:33:26,246 --> 00:33:27,664
This is the best part.

362
00:33:34,597 --> 00:33:36,538
- God!
- Stand up and fight.

363
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:39,856
Hero.

364
00:33:54,939 --> 00:33:56,484
Come on, Percy.

365
00:34:04,134 --> 00:34:05,659
Go to the water.

366
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:15,142
The water will give you power.

367
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,635
Excuse me. Excuse me!

368
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:07,310
Ladies and gentlemen, the son
of Poseidon is coming through!

369
00:37:07,345 --> 00:37:09,757
A hero is coming through! Move it!

370
00:37:10,192 --> 00:37:12,170
Hey, no dirty look. Stop that.

371
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,360
Hey, Percy?

372
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,510
We're having a party
at our place later

373
00:37:17,545 --> 00:37:19,512
and we would really
love it if you came.

374
00:37:19,547 --> 00:37:21,203
I would love to come,
that'll be great.

375
00:37:21,238 --> 00:37:22,825
- That will be amazing!
- Really grand.

376
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,400
I would love to come too,
to the party, you know.

377
00:37:25,435 --> 00:37:26,920
Thanks for inviting me, ladies.

378
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:28,360
Beat it, nymphs.

379
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:31,200
Wait, don't leave, ladies.
I'm available.

380
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,960
Hey, come on, don't leave.
I'm available! What time's the party?

381
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,890
Feeling like a hero?

382
00:37:36,925 --> 00:37:38,260
More like a mutant.

383
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:41,510
I'm not gonna grow a fish tail
or gills or anything like that, am I?

384
00:37:41,545 --> 00:37:42,960
Not likely.

385
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,770
Although a huge ego is
not out of question.

386
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,330
You know, you could've
killed me out there.

387
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:54,080
I could've died if
I was normal.

388
00:37:54,115 --> 00:37:55,520
But you aren't.

389
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:59,250
I get a sense that
you don't like me very much.

390
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,900
It's possible.

391
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,220
I mean, our parents
hate each other.

392
00:38:03,255 --> 00:38:04,710
Wait, they do?

393
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,340
I definitely have strong
feelings for you.

394
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:12,490
I just haven't decided if
they're positive or negative.

395
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:17,050
Well, you let me know
when you figured it out.

396
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,650
You'll be the first.

397
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:43,250
Percy Jackson show me yourself!

398
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,070
Hades, stay back!

399
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:11,460
Percy Jackson, bring
me the bolt.

400
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:17,880
Be a good boy, hand it to me,

401
00:39:17,915 --> 00:39:20,730
and I will exchange it for your mother.

402
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,090
Percy, listen, Percy!

403
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:30,230
My mother is gone!

404
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:35,010
No, your mother is still alive.

405
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:38,060
I sent the minotaur
to abduct her.

406
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:41,050
She's here with me
in the Underworld.

407
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,380
Mom?

408
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,840
Percy.

409
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:58,925
What have you done with my mother?

410
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,220
If you ever want to see your mother
again, you will bring me the bolt.

411
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,920
Chiron, I have to go get her.

412
00:40:11,955 --> 00:40:14,130
Percy, you don't
have the bolt.

413
00:40:14,165 --> 00:40:15,590
I'm gonna tell him the truth.

414
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,280
When he realizes, I'm not the thief.

415
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:19,870
- He'll release her.
- No.

416
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:21,855
You cannot negotiate with Hades.

417
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:24,190
When he finds out you
don't have the bolt

418
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,160
he will kill you and your mother.

419
00:40:27,195 --> 00:40:29,121
But this is our only chance.

420
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:31,780
No, stick to our plan.

421
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,435
Come to Olympus.

422
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:36,225
Bargain with Zeus.

423
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,274
Once you convince
him of your innocence,

424
00:40:38,275 --> 00:40:41,420
we will do everything in our
power to bring back your mother.

425
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,647
Okay.

426
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,350
Going somewhere?

427
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,565
Yeah, I'll be going for a walk.

428
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,130
For a walk?
I'm coming with you.

429
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:09,955
No, I'm going alone.

430
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:11,370
- No, I'm coming with you.
- No.

431
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,490
You're being followed.

432
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,800
Leave me alone.
Go to sleep or something.

433
00:41:22,835 --> 00:41:24,180
No.

434
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:27,450
One small victory and you're
ready to fight Hades?

435
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,080
- Double team.
- Really? You too?

436
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,450
Look, I just found out my mother is
still alive, I'm gonna get her back.

437
00:41:33,485 --> 00:41:35,490
- From the Underworld?
- Whatever it takes.

438
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,560
Yeah, well maybe you'll outsmart Hades.

439
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:38,955
Maybe I will.

440
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,370
I can't let you do this, okay?

441
00:41:40,405 --> 00:41:42,980
I'm not asking for your permission.

442
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,545
Okay.

443
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:47,430
Well, according to the regulations,
if I can't stop you

444
00:41:47,465 --> 00:41:49,850
I must accompany you, coz
I'm your best friend.

445
00:41:49,885 --> 00:41:52,310
- And your protector.
- Junior protector.

446
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,085
Was that really necessary?

447
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,800
I don't need your help, okay.
This is something I have to do on my own.

448
00:41:57,835 --> 00:41:59,810
Yeah well, we weren't
asking for you permission.

449
00:41:59,823 --> 00:42:01,125
Come on.

450
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:04,200
Today you tried to kill me.
Now you wanna defend me?

451
00:42:04,235 --> 00:42:05,647
It wasn't real.

452
00:42:05,682 --> 00:42:07,060
That was just training.

453
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:10,725
Percy, that's all I've ever done
is train and train.

454
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,040
I've grown up here, I've only
been in the outside world

455
00:42:13,075 --> 00:42:14,455
a couple of times.

456
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,270
And I've never had a chance
to go in an actual quest.

457
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,580
Beside, you won one battle,

458
00:42:20,615 --> 00:42:22,332
and I've won hundreds.

459
00:42:22,367 --> 00:42:24,050
You're gonna need my experience.

460
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,090
Good point.

461
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,670
You two really wanna come.

462
00:42:29,705 --> 00:42:31,140
- Yeah.
- Yes.

463
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:34,645
Okay. I guess we're all going.

464
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,020
So, who knows how to
get to the Underworld?

465
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,630
I did not think of that one.

466
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:44,740
I think I know someone
who might.

467
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,080
Luke?

468
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:55,810
Hey, guys.

469
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:59,880
Percy. I'm thinking that you'd
stop by sooner or later.

470
00:42:59,915 --> 00:43:01,920
Everybody does.

471
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,440
Getting away from all
that Renaissance Fair...

472
00:43:05,475 --> 00:43:07,490
stuff out there, you know.

473
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,010
But ...

474
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,740
Welcome to the modern world.

475
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,730
Cool stuff.

476
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,240
What are you guys up to?

477
00:43:21,275 --> 00:43:23,150
We're going to get my mom back.

478
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:27,495
You're dad is the messenger of the gods.

479
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:30,450
One of the only ones who's gotten
in and out of the Underworld.

480
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:33,180
Do you have any idea how?

481
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,990
My dad's a jerk,
I've never met him.

482
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:38,935
You too?

483
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:40,900
Guess we all got
daddy issues, huh?

484
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,749
That's because all gods are the same.

485
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:46,210
Selfish, they only care
about themselves.

486
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:50,320
But I once broke into
my dad's house.

487
00:43:50,355 --> 00:43:51,820
Got some cool stuff.

488
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:05,440
For you.

489
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:18,120
Flying shoes?

490
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:22,220
My dad's.

491
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,070
He has hundreds of these little guys.

492
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:29,990
I won't even miss him.

493
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,670
You're gonna need the other one.

494
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,590
People have gone to the Underworld
before without having to be dead.

495
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:43,870
Hercules did it, Morpheus did it,
my dad does it all the time.

496
00:44:43,905 --> 00:44:45,740
Getting in is the easy part.

497
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:47,990
Getting out, well, that's tricky.

498
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:50,970
This is a map to Persephone's pearls.

499
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:52,800
Persephone?

500
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:54,485
You mean Hades' wife?

501
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,470
Yeah, he forced her to marry him.
He keeps her prisoner.

502
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:59,940
Needless to say she hates it there.

503
00:44:59,975 --> 00:45:01,810
It's hot, he's a weirdo.

504
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:05,720
So she has secret visitors.

505
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:09,985
She keeps pearls and
put them all over the world.

506
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,960
These pearls, they provide a
quick escape from the Underworld.

507
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:15,400
You could use them to get out.

508
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:17,310
So how do the pearls work?

509
00:45:17,345 --> 00:45:18,695
Easy.

510
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:21,170
You take a pearl, step
on it, you crush it,

511
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,400
and visualize where
you wanna be taken.

512
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,980
Right now, there's three pearls
in the United States.

513
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,300
This map will guide you there.

514
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:29,390
Right here is your first location.

515
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,570
Auntie Em's Garden Emporium.

516
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:37,280
Once you find the first pearl,
the map will show you the next one,

517
00:45:37,315 --> 00:45:39,260
and the next one, and then
you're off to Hades.

518
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:46,300
Which reminds me, you guys
might need some extra protection.

519
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:51,440
My favorite shield.

520
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:53,610
You might wanna take a step back.

521
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,910
- Thanks, Luke.
- Don't mention it.

522
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,900
But ...

523
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:11,220
You're gonna have to promise
me one thing.

524
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,660
If you see my dad
on the highway to hell

525
00:46:14,695 --> 00:46:17,300
- Yeah.
- Kick his ass for me.

526
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:50,413
This place definitely needs
an extreme makeover.

527
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:55,969
Hello?

528
00:46:57,883 --> 00:47:01,077
Hello, anybody home in Auntieville?

529
00:47:02,464 --> 00:47:04,174
Check this out,
they got free sodas.

530
00:47:08,641 --> 00:47:10,709
Okay, that's nasty.

531
00:47:11,593 --> 00:47:13,817
The health department
needs to give this place an "F".

532
00:47:17,805 --> 00:47:20,914
Hey guys, check this out.

533
00:47:29,716 --> 00:47:31,073
Look at this.

534
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:35,922
Gold Drachmas.

535
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:37,671
It means we're on the right track.

536
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:39,752
Here.

537
00:47:41,429 --> 00:47:42,897
How are we gonna find
the pearl in this place?

538
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,409
That's a good question.

539
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:46,435
Okay, let's split up.

540
00:47:46,536 --> 00:47:48,393
- Check everything.
- Good idea.

541
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:49,887
I'll go this way.

542
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:55,902
Auntie Em?

543
00:48:12,464 --> 00:48:14,568
- She's coming!
- What? Who?

544
00:48:14,657 --> 00:48:17,567
We stopped to get directions,
my poor husband.

545
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:20,197
Help me! Please help me!

546
00:48:30,225 --> 00:48:33,784
Check this out. He's just
like my Uncle Ferdinand.

547
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:37,161
That's crazy.

548
00:48:38,567 --> 00:48:40,020
He got the mole in the same place.

549
00:48:42,234 --> 00:48:46,221
But that's not my Uncle Ferdinand,
coz my Uncle Ferdinand was killed by...

550
00:48:47,641 --> 00:48:48,985
Medusa!

551
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:55,034
- We're in trouble!
- Grover?

552
00:48:59,724 --> 00:49:02,188
We have to leave
before she finds us.
- Who?

553
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:04,562
She turned my husband to stone.

554
00:49:04,762 --> 00:49:06,631
Grover, where are you?

555
00:49:08,082 --> 00:49:10,788
Percy! Annabeth!

556
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,111
- Annabeth, where are you?
- Grover.

557
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:20,395
Come on, man.
Watch where you're going!

558
00:49:21,582 --> 00:49:23,475
- Where are we?
- We're in Medusa's lair.

559
00:49:29,609 --> 00:49:30,919
Don't move!

560
00:49:33,897 --> 00:49:37,687
Well, this is a fabulous surprise.

561
00:49:38,955 --> 00:49:43,477
It's so heartening to have
such young visitors.

562
00:49:44,676 --> 00:49:46,861
We get so lonely here.

563
00:49:46,862 --> 00:49:49,347
Don't we?

564
00:49:50,795 --> 00:49:54,319
That's why I created my statues.

565
00:49:57,110 --> 00:49:58,836
They're my only company.

566
00:50:01,078 --> 00:50:04,800
- Daughter of Athena.
- How do you know me?

567
00:50:05,186 --> 00:50:08,944
You have such beautiful hair.

568
00:50:10,352 --> 00:50:12,866
I once had hair like that.

569
00:50:14,924 --> 00:50:20,821
I was courted, desired by many suitors.

570
00:50:21,927 --> 00:50:27,103
But that all changed
because of your mother.

571
00:50:28,504 --> 00:50:30,542
The woman who cursed me.

572
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,739
Who turned me...

573
00:50:35,941 --> 00:50:37,962
- Don't look!
- into this.

574
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:44,931
They say the eyes are
windows to the soul.

575
00:50:46,102 --> 00:50:49,613
I hope you find my eyes...

576
00:50:51,828 --> 00:50:53,253
attractive.

577
00:50:55,853 --> 00:51:00,168
It's so rude not looking
people in the eye.

578
00:51:02,411 --> 00:51:03,740
Come on.

579
00:51:04,432 --> 00:51:08,927
Sneak a peek.

580
00:51:27,737 --> 00:51:29,664
How are we gonna fight
something we can't look at?

581
00:51:30,176 --> 00:51:31,642
We can look at her reflection.

582
00:51:33,501 --> 00:51:36,093
- Check this out.
- Good idea.

583
00:51:36,439 --> 00:51:38,882
- I'll go get Annabeth.
- Okay, I will take care of Medusa.

584
00:51:40,125 --> 00:51:43,646
You'll make a wonderful
addition to my collection.

585
00:51:44,675 --> 00:51:47,348
We'll be friends forever.

586
00:51:47,808 --> 00:51:49,150
Do you mind?

587
00:51:58,587 --> 00:52:04,521
Sooner or later,
you will open those eyes.

588
00:52:06,473 --> 00:52:11,295
The temptation to look
at me is too hard to resist!

589
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:14,046
Don't look, Annabeth,
don't open your eyes!

590
00:52:16,294 --> 00:52:20,425
Who's that? Another demigod?

591
00:52:29,334 --> 00:52:31,378
I can sense you.

592
00:52:51,906 --> 00:52:53,668
Son of Poseidon.

593
00:52:55,929 --> 00:52:58,945
I used to date your daddy.

594
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:11,924
Need a hand?

595
00:53:15,465 --> 00:53:18,165
- Thanks.
- Come on. Let's go.

596
00:53:25,846 --> 00:53:31,133
I heard you have the lightning bolt.
May I see it?

597
00:53:32,145 --> 00:53:33,565
I don't have it.

598
00:53:36,031 --> 00:53:39,006
Let me see your eyes.

599
00:53:40,256 --> 00:53:43,393
I heard their bluer
that the seclusian sea

600
00:53:44,582 --> 00:53:46,001
Open them!

601
00:53:46,002 --> 00:53:51,824
Or my hungry babies
will have to open them for you.

602
00:53:54,405 --> 00:54:00,048
Well, it will be such pity to destroy

603
00:54:00,049 --> 00:54:02,870
such young and handsome face.

604
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:08,416
Stay with me, Percy.

605
00:54:09,567 --> 00:54:14,290
All you have to do is look!

606
00:54:30,879 --> 00:54:32,489
Are you okay?

607
00:54:35,693 --> 00:54:37,056
Yeah, I'm okay.

608
00:54:43,641 --> 00:54:46,345
Son of Poseidon ...

609
00:55:00,156 --> 00:55:01,649
Piss off.

610
00:55:06,283 --> 00:55:09,562
Guys, it's cool to open up your eyes.

611
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:14,584
Annabeth, that was great,
great demigod driving.

612
00:55:19,561 --> 00:55:23,169
- We could take it with us.
- The head? No, that's sick.

613
00:55:23,334 --> 00:55:24,958
You open the eyes,
they still work.

614
00:55:24,998 --> 00:55:26,396
Dead or alive.

615
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:28,686
You'll never know when
something like that may come in handy.

616
00:55:28,993 --> 00:55:31,025
Yeah, you're right
but I'm not touching it.

617
00:55:31,178 --> 00:55:32,478
Come on, man.
Just take off your jacket.

618
00:55:32,479 --> 00:55:34,100
We'll wrap it up
until we get some ice.

619
00:55:34,903 --> 00:55:37,112
Why do I have to take off my jacket?

620
00:55:37,113 --> 00:55:38,413
Because you're the protector.

621
00:55:39,591 --> 00:55:41,091
Yeah, I'm the protector.

622
00:55:41,092 --> 00:55:43,856
So I'm giving my hoody,
and not my jacket, okay?

623
00:55:50,167 --> 00:55:53,047
- It's disgusting.
- Just toss it up.

624
00:55:56,997 --> 00:55:58,339
Hey, guys, wait.

625
00:56:05,632 --> 00:56:07,686
One down. Two to go.

626
00:56:09,953 --> 00:56:13,264
It would've been nice if Luke
had warned us about Medusa.

627
00:56:13,542 --> 00:56:15,333
Maybe he just didn't know.

628
00:56:15,812 --> 00:56:17,901
GPS from the gods. Where to next?

629
00:56:19,091 --> 00:56:21,117
Let's see.

630
00:56:26,176 --> 00:56:28,228
Parthenon in Nashville.

631
00:56:28,328 --> 00:56:30,968
Nashville? Great.

632
00:56:31,068 --> 00:56:33,383
Home of my least favorite music.

633
00:56:54,933 --> 00:56:58,435
Let's not do that again.
Let's stop right about now.

634
00:56:58,535 --> 00:57:01,130
- Good idea.
- Oh my God.

635
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,162
Nice work today.

636
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:47,928
Thanks.

637
00:57:49,314 --> 00:57:51,251
What happened to you?

638
00:57:52,908 --> 00:57:55,685
That poor lady who turned
to stone, she ...

639
00:57:56,269 --> 00:57:58,536
she have a tight grip.

640
00:58:00,258 --> 00:58:02,158
Check this out.

641
00:58:14,266 --> 00:58:16,152
Cool.

642
00:58:16,252 --> 00:58:18,343
That was very cool.

643
00:58:19,869 --> 00:58:21,685
So...

644
00:58:21,785 --> 00:58:23,710
Why do our parents hate each other?

645
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:26,794
They both wanted to
be patron god of Athens.

646
00:58:27,298 --> 00:58:28,969
And...

647
00:58:29,069 --> 00:58:31,080
The people chose Athena.

648
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:34,447
And our parents have
hated each other ever since.

649
00:58:35,283 --> 00:58:38,439
- What's your mom like?
- I don't know.

650
00:58:38,539 --> 00:58:41,866
- I never met her.
- What? Is it...

651
00:58:42,204 --> 00:58:43,845
like this for everybody?

652
00:58:43,945 --> 00:58:46,626
Don't any god
see their kids?

653
00:58:46,726 --> 00:58:48,396
It's forbidden.

654
00:58:48,693 --> 00:58:52,146
Right after we're born, Zeus
decreed that the gods

655
00:58:52,246 --> 00:58:55,514
could not have physical contact
with their mortal offspring.

656
00:58:55,614 --> 00:58:57,525
Well, that's just a stupid law.

657
00:58:57,625 --> 00:58:59,150
I agree.

658
00:59:00,309 --> 00:59:02,359
Although ...

659
00:59:02,913 --> 00:59:04,917
Between us ...

660
00:59:05,888 --> 00:59:08,671
I think my mother speaks
to me sometimes.

661
00:59:09,096 --> 00:59:13,560
In times of trouble, I hear
her voice giving me advice.

662
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:15,230
That's happened to me.

663
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:18,789
Yeah, that's your father
talking to you.

664
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,000
Hey yo, Percy!

665
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:23,402
Get in here, man. This is ugly.

666
00:59:24,299 --> 00:59:25,900
Right.

667
00:59:26,218 --> 00:59:27,924
Hey hurry up!

668
00:59:28,382 --> 00:59:30,694
Percy. Check this out, man.

669
00:59:31,517 --> 00:59:32,842
You're on TV.

670
00:59:32,843 --> 00:59:35,142
Regarding the missing boy,
Percy Jackson

671
00:59:35,242 --> 00:59:37,131
and his mother, Sally Ugliano.

672
00:59:37,231 --> 00:59:39,950
But their relatives have
some interesting theories.

673
00:59:40,261 --> 00:59:43,287
So, Mr. Ugliano talk to me
about your son, Percy Jackson.

674
00:59:43,387 --> 00:59:45,796
He's not my son.
He's stepson.

675
00:59:45,896 --> 00:59:47,783
He did not come from this loins.

676
00:59:47,883 --> 00:59:50,586
Ever since he started
with the drugs and the alcohol...

677
00:59:50,686 --> 00:59:52,070
Oh no.

678
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:55,052
Five nights ago, he tried to kill me
and he threw his mother on the ground

679
00:59:55,152 --> 00:59:59,595
And his friend crippled friend then
attacked me from behind and knocked me out.

680
00:59:59,695 --> 01:00:02,187
When I woke up, Sally was gone.

681
01:00:02,303 --> 01:00:04,366
She was kidnapped by Percy.
... She would never

682
01:00:04,466 --> 01:00:06,035
Shut up, Gabe.

683
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:08,391
Great. Now, I'm a fugitive.

684
01:00:08,491 --> 01:00:10,375
See? That's what I'm talking about man.

685
01:00:10,475 --> 01:00:12,292
Gabe's always running his mouth.

686
01:00:12,392 --> 01:00:15,270
He's mad because I blasted
him up with my crutches.

687
01:00:17,088 --> 01:00:18,600
Guys.

688
01:00:19,419 --> 01:00:22,370
I can't pee with
her watching me.

689
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:36,503
Sorry, guys. I messed up.

690
01:00:36,603 --> 01:00:38,465
Should have closed the curtains.

691
01:00:38,565 --> 01:00:39,971
Come on, guys.

692
01:00:40,071 --> 01:00:42,896
Let's hit the road before
Homeland Security shows up.

693
01:01:17,701 --> 01:01:19,431
That's amazing.

694
01:01:19,531 --> 01:01:22,390
A complete replica of the
Parthenon in Nashville.

695
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:25,270
Alright, guys.
Let's go get the pearl.

696
01:01:49,964 --> 01:01:51,885
It's your mother.

697
01:01:52,717 --> 01:01:55,000
I wonder if she really looks like that.

698
01:01:57,962 --> 01:01:59,775
We'll find out.

699
01:02:03,033 --> 01:02:06,496
Guys, check this out.

700
01:02:09,721 --> 01:02:11,260
It's the pearl.

701
01:02:16,452 --> 01:02:18,100
That was easy.

702
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,666
Easy?

703
01:02:19,766 --> 01:02:23,124
It's 30 feet or meter and this
place is filled with tourists.

704
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:26,530
I got an idea.

705
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:29,930
We'll come back after this place closes.
Come on, follow me.

706
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:34,130
Or I could just throw my crutches up
there, see if the pearl will fall off.

707
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:37,321
Percy I'm saying, it's not a bad idea.

708
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,094
The park's been closed
for an hour.

709
01:02:51,194 --> 01:02:52,713
Let's move.

710
01:02:52,813 --> 01:02:54,662
Let's hurry.

711
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,277
It's a little bit crazy.

712
01:02:57,377 --> 01:03:00,862
I'm gonna fly up using Luke's
flying shoes and I'll grab the pearl.

713
01:03:00,962 --> 01:03:02,705
Cool.

714
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:12,675
So, what are we gonna do?

715
01:03:13,441 --> 01:03:15,272
Alright, guys.

716
01:03:16,761 --> 01:03:18,500
- I got this.
- Got what?

717
01:03:20,450 --> 01:03:22,460
- You'll kill the checkers?
- Chill.

718
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,711
Those are working cost Americans.

719
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:41,707
- Why did you do that?
- They're not dead.

720
01:03:41,807 --> 01:03:43,900
They're unconscious
for only 30 minutes. Come on!

721
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,616
Cool.

722
01:03:58,506 --> 01:04:00,100
Yo, what's cracking?

723
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,641
Hey.

724
01:04:01,741 --> 01:04:03,300
Luke!

725
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:06,075
- Annabeth!
- How do you turn on the shoes?

726
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:08,731
Tell Percy he's gonna break
into a run, okay.

727
01:04:08,831 --> 01:04:13,343
He's gonna draw up speed
kinda like a jet on a runway.

728
01:04:13,443 --> 01:04:15,317
It's gonna take some practice.

729
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:17,343
Okay.

730
01:04:17,817 --> 01:04:19,400
I got this.

731
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:23,306
It's gonna take some practice!

732
01:04:54,077 --> 01:04:55,401
- I got it!
- Yes!

733
01:04:55,501 --> 01:04:57,661
- Yeah, Percy!
- There we go.

734
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:03,643
There it is!

735
01:05:04,027 --> 01:05:06,406
- That's what I'm talking about.
- There we go.

736
01:05:06,506 --> 01:05:09,371
Alright, let's grab everything.
Let's go.

737
01:05:11,425 --> 01:05:13,114
Aw, man ...

738
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,400
I got this, okay.

739
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,929
Hey guys, I'm with
Park Recreational Services

740
01:05:24,029 --> 01:05:25,962
you guys have been caught sleeping on the job.

741
01:05:26,062 --> 01:05:29,172
You better be happy I'm not
writing you guys up, okay. It's the last time.

742
01:05:29,272 --> 01:05:32,042
We were expecting you, Mr.
Jackson.

743
01:05:33,739 --> 01:05:37,160
Give us the lightning
bolt and we'll let you go.

744
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:39,897
I don't have the lightning bolt.

745
01:05:41,166 --> 01:05:43,650
Okay. This is bad.

746
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,800
Hydra!

747
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:06,670
Guys, watch out, because
that one will spit us fire!

748
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:32,680
You got a sweet tooth.

749
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:34,366
Alright.

750
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:55,835
Percy, stop!

751
01:06:56,177 --> 01:06:57,600
No!

752
01:07:10,261 --> 01:07:13,070
How could I've been awesome with that!
I just killed that thing!

753
01:07:13,170 --> 01:07:16,185
- Killed it? You only made it worse.
- What are you talking about?

754
01:07:16,285 --> 01:07:21,077
Percy, when you cut off one hydra
head, two more grow back.

755
01:07:28,908 --> 01:07:30,482
Run.

756
01:07:32,731 --> 01:07:35,149
Distract that thing.
I'll get the pearl.

757
01:08:45,058 --> 01:08:46,853
Go.

758
01:08:49,773 --> 01:08:52,777
- Open the door!
- The door won't open!

759
01:08:53,168 --> 01:08:54,786
Grover!

760
01:09:32,643 --> 01:09:34,489
That's nasty.

761
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:42,090
We cut our regularly scheduled
programming with this special report.

762
01:09:42,190 --> 01:09:45,870
Scientists are baffled by what
now appears to be single

763
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:49,201
storm cloud that is expanding
over the rest of Europe and Asia

764
01:09:49,301 --> 01:09:51,200
moving towards the United States.

765
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:54,686
Savage winds, rains and
manic waves are being reported

766
01:09:54,786 --> 01:09:56,885
along the coastlines of
several continents.

767
01:09:56,985 --> 01:10:01,465
So far, no casualties, but countries
everywhere are preparing for the worst.

768
01:10:01,565 --> 01:10:03,666
The gods are angry.

769
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:07,390
We need to get the last pearl.
Where's the next location?

770
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:10,570
Yeah. Let us see...

771
01:10:11,930 --> 01:10:15,258
Well guys. We got ourselves a good one.

772
01:10:15,358 --> 01:10:17,341
We're going to Vegas!

773
01:10:53,442 --> 01:10:55,188
There it is.

774
01:10:55,594 --> 01:10:57,709
Lotus Casino.

775
01:11:14,066 --> 01:11:16,232
I've been looking forward to this.

776
01:11:16,332 --> 01:11:19,249
Look guys, remember, always
put the 8's and never the 10's, okay.

777
01:11:19,349 --> 01:11:20,974
We're not here to gamble, remember?

778
01:11:21,074 --> 01:11:24,158
- They got poker, they got black jack.
- Grover.

779
01:11:24,258 --> 01:11:27,589
We're not here to have fun.
We just need to grab the pearl and go, okay.

780
01:11:31,627 --> 01:11:33,657
This is nice.

781
01:11:50,605 --> 01:11:52,510
This place is officially gold.

782
01:11:52,610 --> 01:11:54,714
Here is your complimentary
Lotus fun book.

783
01:11:54,814 --> 01:11:56,506
Thanks, but we're not staying.

784
01:11:56,606 --> 01:11:59,960
Please, I insist.
It's good for everything in the Hotel and Casino.

785
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:02,728
Don't come to us.
We're not checking in.

786
01:12:02,991 --> 01:12:05,441
- That guy was persistent.
- Yeah.

787
01:12:06,669 --> 01:12:10,303
But we're here for one thing
and one thing only.

788
01:12:11,109 --> 01:12:13,400
That is really awesome.

789
01:12:15,366 --> 01:12:18,945
Where would we find a green
pearl in this place?

790
01:12:19,833 --> 01:12:23,802
Maybe I'll cap a waitress or a showgirl.
We should start there.

791
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:28,791
Can I get you something?

792
01:12:28,891 --> 01:12:33,415
Try a Lotus flower. They're so good.
It's our signature dish.

793
01:12:34,181 --> 01:12:37,860
Really? Signature? Is it good?

794
01:12:38,786 --> 01:12:40,208
Thank you.

795
01:12:40,308 --> 01:12:42,395
Don't we have to pay for this?

796
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:44,930
- I guess we don't.
- It's free.

797
01:12:48,279 --> 01:12:50,590
This is really good.

798
01:12:55,926 --> 01:12:59,002
This is the most delicious
thing I've ever consumed!

799
01:13:21,558 --> 01:13:24,047
Why don't we stay here for a while?

800
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,444
That sounds like an amazing idea.

801
01:13:28,591 --> 01:13:33,750
But we're on a time sensitive
mission right now.

802
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:35,843
Aren't we?

803
01:13:35,943 --> 01:13:37,653
I can't remember.

804
01:13:37,753 --> 01:13:40,510
I totally forgot what
I was gonna say.

805
01:13:40,610 --> 01:13:43,561
I think I figured it out.
I think I know why we're here.

806
01:13:43,661 --> 01:13:45,111
Why are we here?

807
01:13:45,211 --> 01:13:46,670
To have fun!

808
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:51,783
Okay. Let's never leave.
Let's stay here!

809
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,718
Awesome!

810
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,397
No, Percy, don't
eat the flower.

811
01:14:57,178 --> 01:15:01,727
It dulls the senses.
It keeps you prisoner here.

812
01:15:02,376 --> 01:15:05,397
Hey, I'll get some air.
I'll be right back.

813
01:15:10,338 --> 01:15:13,803
- Another Lotus flower?
- No, I'm good, thank you.

814
01:15:16,653 --> 01:15:21,069
Look around you. Focus.

815
01:15:21,169 --> 01:15:23,612
- Lotus flower?
- No, thank you.

816
01:15:24,635 --> 01:15:27,145
- Would you like another one?
- I'm fine.

817
01:15:33,133 --> 01:15:37,507
- "The French Connection"?
- Yeah, you've seen it yet?

818
01:15:38,561 --> 01:15:41,049
Yeah, I think so, on DVD.

819
01:15:41,149 --> 01:15:43,212
What's DVD?

820
01:15:44,008 --> 01:15:46,056
Seriously?

821
01:15:46,156 --> 01:15:48,853
I think it's the best
movie of the year.

822
01:15:49,014 --> 01:15:52,162
What? Wait, this year?

823
01:15:53,385 --> 01:15:56,787
This year. 1971.

824
01:16:03,848 --> 01:16:05,577
Percy, wake up.

825
01:16:06,072 --> 01:16:08,556
You need to escape. Wake up!

826
01:16:08,656 --> 01:16:10,419
You can really use a Lotus flower.

827
01:16:10,519 --> 01:16:11,931
I really don't want that.
Thank you.

828
01:16:12,031 --> 01:16:14,042
- Just one.
- No.

829
01:16:28,693 --> 01:16:30,030
Another Lotus flower?

830
01:16:30,031 --> 01:16:31,691
- No.
- We insist.

831
01:16:31,692 --> 01:16:34,074
I really don't want another Lotus flower.
So please leave me alone.

832
01:16:34,075 --> 01:16:37,008
Is there a problem, Mr. Jackson?

833
01:16:37,852 --> 01:16:40,465
No, thank you.

834
01:16:45,512 --> 01:16:47,751
Percy Jackson is awake.

835
01:16:50,991 --> 01:16:52,659
Excuse me.

836
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:54,707
What are you doing with that?
Don't eat that.

837
01:16:54,708 --> 01:16:56,057
- What?
- We have to go now.

838
01:16:56,157 --> 01:16:58,593
- What do you mean? We're having so much fun.
- No, we're not having fun.

839
01:16:58,693 --> 01:17:00,516
Grover, wake up!

840
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:02,235
Grover, come one, we gotta go!

841
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:05,222
Not now, Percy, your timing
is terrible, okay.

842
01:17:05,322 --> 01:17:08,219
Dude, we're heading to the chapel.
We're getting married.

843
01:17:08,319 --> 01:17:10,149
- How romantic!
- No, no, no ...

844
01:17:10,249 --> 01:17:12,790
Which one of you is going with me?

845
01:17:13,994 --> 01:17:15,631
Wake up!

846
01:17:15,731 --> 01:17:18,333
Yo man, you're such a bust kill!

847
01:17:18,433 --> 01:17:20,713
Percy, what's wrong with you?
Why are you doing this?

848
01:17:20,813 --> 01:17:22,525
Both of you need to wake up now!

849
01:17:22,625 --> 01:17:25,355
Look at me, you're in a trance, okay.
We're trapped!

850
01:17:25,455 --> 01:17:29,196
Listen to me, if you eat the flowers,
you'll never gonna leave.

851
01:17:29,296 --> 01:17:31,179
We're gonna be stuck here forever!

852
01:17:34,091 --> 01:17:36,006
Oh, no! We gotta go!

853
01:17:36,106 --> 01:17:37,863
Guys, we gotta go!

854
01:17:44,807 --> 01:17:47,012
Stop right there.

855
01:18:07,531 --> 01:18:09,124
Out of the way.

856
01:18:09,224 --> 01:18:10,861
Come on.

857
01:18:11,996 --> 01:18:13,837
Come on, guys. The car!

858
01:18:16,566 --> 01:18:19,670
Come on, come on. In the car.
Let's go. Keys.

859
01:18:19,969 --> 01:18:21,803
- I got the keys.
- Go, go!

860
01:18:21,928 --> 01:18:23,458
Incoming. Incoming.

861
01:18:23,558 --> 01:18:25,938
- I got this.
- Go!

862
01:18:47,922 --> 01:18:51,003
That's how you get out of a casino.
That's how you drive.

863
01:18:51,103 --> 01:18:53,842
- Of course. Now that all makes sense.
- What?

864
01:18:53,942 --> 01:18:55,876
That was the lair of the
"lotus-eaters."

865
01:18:55,976 --> 01:18:58,822
They've been luring people into
their traps since ancient times.

866
01:18:58,922 --> 01:19:01,634
Guys, look.
Tomorrow is June 21st.

867
01:19:01,734 --> 01:19:04,291
No, it can't be. Today is the 15th.

868
01:19:04,391 --> 01:19:07,986
No. Tomorrow is 21st. We were
in there for five days.

869
01:19:08,086 --> 01:19:11,051
- Felt like an hour.
- Tomorrow is the solstice.

870
01:19:11,151 --> 01:19:12,820
Our deadline is tomorrow
at midnight.

871
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:15,393
Okay, look we gotta move.
Where's Hades?

872
01:19:22,136 --> 01:19:25,779
- He's in Hollywood.
- Alright.

873
01:19:25,950 --> 01:19:29,571
I get there in four hours.
Maybe three.

874
01:19:57,829 --> 01:20:00,741
And now the latest breaking news KZO1.

875
01:20:00,841 --> 01:20:02,942
An unprecedented storm cloud

876
01:20:03,042 --> 01:20:05,134
is swelling to cover most
of North America.

877
01:20:05,234 --> 01:20:07,953
Authorities in several states
are ordering evacuations

878
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:10,933
and reporting severe
weather conditions.

879
01:20:17,376 --> 01:20:19,150
Watch your step.

880
01:20:20,362 --> 01:20:22,350
Wait.

881
01:20:28,010 --> 01:20:31,179
Woe to all depraved souls.

882
01:21:03,384 --> 01:21:06,406
- There's no turning back now.
- Yes.

883
01:21:06,515 --> 01:21:08,756
As if we're stuck in here.

884
01:21:19,055 --> 01:21:21,616
Percy, who's that creepy
guy with the hood?

885
01:21:21,716 --> 01:21:25,810
I don't know. Let's find out.

886
01:21:29,292 --> 01:21:32,644
- Who are you?
- We need to see Hades.

887
01:21:32,744 --> 01:21:38,130
The living are not permitted here.
Die and come back.

888
01:21:39,226 --> 01:21:43,097
Okay, we won't die
and come back...

889
01:21:43,246 --> 01:21:45,482
You know what?

890
01:21:48,228 --> 01:21:50,563
We gotta pay the ferry.

891
01:21:52,516 --> 01:21:55,699
Yo, my friend. What up?

892
01:21:57,049 --> 01:21:59,923
Okay, that's not like it.
You like dead, alright?

893
01:22:00,023 --> 01:22:02,777
I got here two dead people
you might recognize.

894
01:22:02,877 --> 01:22:06,994
Check this out: Jackson, Grant and
look who's joining the party.

895
01:22:07,136 --> 01:22:10,323
Benjamin Franklin.
Yeah, you like that, aren't you?

896
01:22:10,423 --> 01:22:14,227
You give us a boat ride, you take the money
and you get an interior decorator

897
01:22:14,327 --> 01:22:16,490
coz it's too depressing in here, alright.

898
01:22:16,590 --> 01:22:18,219
Here you go.

899
01:22:25,231 --> 01:22:28,419
- That's a $170.
- Wait.

900
01:22:29,075 --> 01:22:31,177
The Drachmas.

901
01:22:40,428 --> 01:22:41,838
Come aboard.

902
01:22:41,938 --> 01:22:44,445
Thanks for telling me, man.
You're burning money, we're in recession.

903
01:22:44,446 --> 01:22:47,056
- This is treason.
- Shut up.

904
01:23:05,684 --> 01:23:08,510
Welcome to the Underworld.

905
01:23:12,619 --> 01:23:14,953
What is all this?

906
01:23:16,341 --> 01:23:19,550
It's graphic of human misery.

907
01:23:19,650 --> 01:23:22,940
Lost hopes and dreams.

908
01:23:23,905 --> 01:23:27,151
Wishes that never
came true.

909
01:23:40,554 --> 01:23:44,148
All lives end in
suffering and tragedy.

910
01:24:12,129 --> 01:24:14,575
This is as far as I go.

911
01:24:34,539 --> 01:24:36,148
Guys, do you hear that?

912
01:24:36,248 --> 01:24:38,515
- Yes, what is that?
- I don't know.

913
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:46,680
What are we gonna do?

914
01:24:53,232 --> 01:24:56,361
- Who are those things?
- Hellhounds.

915
01:24:56,461 --> 01:24:59,498
Yeah, ,maybe you should feed them.

916
01:25:00,089 --> 01:25:03,296
They sense the presence
of another animal.

917
01:25:03,396 --> 01:25:06,607
- Great, I smell goat.
- You're a satyr.

918
01:25:09,650 --> 01:25:11,762
I haven't had a satyr...

919
01:25:13,906 --> 01:25:15,374
visit before.

920
01:25:15,474 --> 01:25:19,759
Persephone!
What would cause you to be taking so long?

921
01:25:19,859 --> 01:25:23,700
- Don't ignore me.
- Or what?

922
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:28,342
What will you do? I'm already in hell.

923
01:25:47,578 --> 01:25:50,073
We have visitors.

924
01:25:52,632 --> 01:25:54,223
Well, that's you.

925
01:26:05,695 --> 01:26:07,471
Welcome.

926
01:26:08,774 --> 01:26:11,800
You have your
father's looks.

927
01:26:12,063 --> 01:26:16,144
Always the lucky
side of the family.

928
01:26:16,973 --> 01:26:21,277
- Wait. You're Hades?
- Yes.

929
01:26:21,390 --> 01:26:25,400
I'm sorry, I just didn't expect
you to look like this, man.

930
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:27,791
That was stylish, I like it.

931
01:26:27,891 --> 01:26:32,050
Would you prefer that I look like...this?

932
01:26:33,991 --> 01:26:37,885
No! Let's stick with
the Mick Jagger thing.

933
01:26:37,985 --> 01:26:39,965
It works for you.

934
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:51,132
You're very brave coming here.

935
01:26:51,435 --> 01:26:53,489
Come closer.

936
01:26:56,976 --> 01:26:59,659
I can see a look of
disgust in your eyes.

937
01:26:59,759 --> 01:27:01,947
You see, disgust is
not righteous.

938
01:27:02,047 --> 01:27:04,803
I was banished here
by Zeus and his father.

939
01:27:04,943 --> 01:27:08,810
I'm done. My only chance
of getting out of this place...

940
01:27:08,910 --> 01:27:11,628
is defeat my brother and take
control of Olympus.

941
01:27:11,728 --> 01:27:15,346
Of course ... I need the bolt.

942
01:27:16,468 --> 01:27:18,232
And I need my mother.

943
01:27:18,332 --> 01:27:20,009
So we have an understanding.

944
01:27:20,109 --> 01:27:23,000
You give me the bolt and
I'll give you your mother.

945
01:27:27,396 --> 01:27:31,095
I need to tell you the truth.
I'm not the lightning thief.

946
01:27:31,195 --> 01:27:33,142
I don't have the bolt.

947
01:27:33,242 --> 01:27:35,347
I never did.

948
01:27:35,562 --> 01:27:38,528
Why did you come here then?

949
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,193
Well, I was hoping that...

950
01:27:42,655 --> 01:27:46,242
when you saw that I wasn't the thief,
you'll let my mother go.

951
01:27:47,638 --> 01:27:49,899
Do you think I'm an idiot?

952
01:27:50,454 --> 01:27:56,076
I am Hades! Now give me the bolt
or say goodbye to your mother!

953
01:28:20,514 --> 01:28:22,347
Percy!

954
01:28:30,363 --> 01:28:32,352
I thought I lost you forever.

955
01:28:32,452 --> 01:28:33,903
No.

956
01:28:56,648 --> 01:28:59,845
Zeus' master bolt.

957
01:29:03,061 --> 01:29:04,739
Liar.

958
01:29:04,993 --> 01:29:06,416
I swear.

959
01:29:06,516 --> 01:29:09,138
I don't know how that got
into this, it's not even my shield.

960
01:29:09,238 --> 01:29:11,200
No, Luke rigged it.

961
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:13,967
He put the bolt in your
shield and used us.

962
01:29:14,067 --> 01:29:15,757
Luke stole the lightning bolt.

963
01:29:15,857 --> 01:29:17,570
I think we're done here.

964
01:29:19,067 --> 01:29:21,292
Feed them to the souls.

965
01:29:35,645 --> 01:29:37,260
We had a deal, right?

966
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:39,424
You have the bolt,
just let us go.

967
01:29:39,524 --> 01:29:41,302
Summon the hounds.

968
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:51,770
Sit, sit.

969
01:29:57,570 --> 01:29:58,896
I...

970
01:29:58,996 --> 01:30:01,030
...am going to be king of the gods.

971
01:30:01,654 --> 01:30:03,190
Stay back!

972
01:30:05,116 --> 01:30:06,708
Stay!

973
01:30:14,979 --> 01:30:16,772
Alright, come on.

974
01:30:17,674 --> 01:30:19,480
Come on, give it back.

975
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:38,006
Bad dog!

976
01:30:41,398 --> 01:30:43,979
He won't remember a thing.

977
01:30:45,115 --> 01:30:47,400
Why did you do that?

978
01:30:47,721 --> 01:30:49,413
Because...

979
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:51,681
he's cruel and abusive.

980
01:30:52,562 --> 01:30:54,601
The only thing I look forward to

981
01:30:54,701 --> 01:30:57,038
is my allotted time
away from this hell hole.

982
01:30:57,138 --> 01:31:01,025
A war of the gods will put an end to that.

983
01:31:01,570 --> 01:31:03,623
And I'd be alone

984
01:31:03,723 --> 01:31:07,521
with only him forever.

985
01:31:09,706 --> 01:31:11,146
Go.

986
01:31:11,246 --> 01:31:13,430
Take the bolt and your mother.

987
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,682
Only three?

988
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:29,021
No.

989
01:31:29,121 --> 01:31:31,039
There are four of you.

990
01:31:31,416 --> 01:31:34,281
Each pearl transports
only a single person.

991
01:31:35,272 --> 01:31:37,430
One of you will have to stay.

992
01:31:37,962 --> 01:31:39,299
Alright, I'll stay.

993
01:31:39,399 --> 01:31:40,909
- You three go.
- What?

994
01:31:41,009 --> 01:31:43,637
- No.
- No, no, no. I've achieved my quest.

995
01:31:43,737 --> 01:31:46,214
- I'm staying here.
- I've trained for situations like this.

996
01:31:46,314 --> 01:31:48,276
Guys, guys, knock it off.

997
01:31:48,970 --> 01:31:52,424
- I'm staying because I'm your protector.
- Grover, come on.

998
01:31:52,524 --> 01:31:56,512
Look, man, I don't need to hear it.
Just go. It's my duty.

999
01:31:57,506 --> 01:31:59,513
It's my memoir.

1000
01:31:59,666 --> 01:32:01,430
We'll come back for you.

1001
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:05,771
I will take very good care of you.

1002
01:32:07,027 --> 01:32:08,796
All right. Now move it, guys.

1003
01:32:08,896 --> 01:32:12,013
You need to be stepping on the pearl and
concentrating on where you wanna go.

1004
01:32:12,113 --> 01:32:13,497
Take this.

1005
01:32:14,307 --> 01:32:15,925
To Olympus.

1006
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:18,313
Hey, look.

1007
01:33:23,671 --> 01:33:26,765
Zeus and Poseidon are
preparing for battle.

1008
01:33:27,904 --> 01:33:30,573
No, this isn't the right place.
This isn't Olympus.

1009
01:33:30,673 --> 01:33:32,859
This is the Empire State Building.

1010
01:33:32,959 --> 01:33:35,719
Percy, the entrance to
the Olympus is there.

1011
01:33:35,819 --> 01:33:38,072
Well, it's ten minutes till
midnight, let's move.

1012
01:33:38,172 --> 01:33:40,445
Percy Jackson.

1013
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:49,559
You weren't supposed to
make it out alive.

1014
01:33:50,545 --> 01:33:53,590
I can't let you take that
bolt to Olympus.

1015
01:33:54,302 --> 01:33:56,183
I'm the lightning thief.

1016
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:59,533
You hid the bolt in my shield.
Why?

1017
01:33:59,633 --> 01:34:03,264
Well, when you said you were
going to the Underworld, it hit me.

1018
01:34:03,955 --> 01:34:07,201
That is the perfect opportunity
to get the bolt to Hades.

1019
01:34:07,301 --> 01:34:09,232
Why would you do that?

1020
01:34:09,332 --> 01:34:11,590
To bring Olympus
crumbling down.

1021
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:14,167
Percy, let's go.

1022
01:34:14,739 --> 01:34:16,387
Let's go.

1023
01:34:16,867 --> 01:34:20,364
Well, it's too late. Because I'm
returning the bolt to Zeus, right now.

1024
01:34:20,464 --> 01:34:22,401
Not before midnight.

1025
01:34:56,425 --> 01:34:58,385
- Are you alright?
- Yeah.

1026
01:35:00,271 --> 01:35:03,306
Luke, why do you want
a war of the gods?

1027
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:05,590
Control.

1028
01:35:06,550 --> 01:35:08,878
They've been in power for too long.

1029
01:35:09,389 --> 01:35:12,189
I say it's time for our
generation to take over.

1030
01:35:12,289 --> 01:35:14,848
Remold the world in our image.

1031
01:35:14,948 --> 01:35:18,548
- A world of new heroes.
- You're no hero.

1032
01:35:35,228 --> 01:35:37,431
- Annabeth, are you alright?
- Yeah

1033
01:35:38,811 --> 01:35:40,439
Stay here.

1034
01:37:43,371 --> 01:37:45,836
Maybe they were wrong.

1035
01:37:46,703 --> 01:37:49,414
Maybe you're no
son of Poseidon.

1036
01:39:15,471 --> 01:39:17,738
I think I am the
son of Poseidon.

1037
01:39:39,953 --> 01:39:44,313
He got the bolt.
Come on! We got two minutes.

1038
01:40:25,781 --> 01:40:27,500
Olympus.

1039
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:37,027
Percy, I can't get through.
You gotta go.

1040
01:40:53,739 --> 01:40:55,866
Silence!

1041
01:41:08,068 --> 01:41:09,903
It's almost midnight.

1042
01:41:10,003 --> 01:41:13,182
This was predestined.
You wanted to get this badly.

1043
01:41:13,282 --> 01:41:15,550
You have only yourself to blame!

1044
01:41:15,650 --> 01:41:17,332
Please!

1045
01:41:17,432 --> 01:41:20,435
Let's be rational.
War is not the answer!

1046
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:26,641
- Time has run out.
- Wait!

1047
01:41:26,741 --> 01:41:29,226
Wait! Wait!

1048
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:40,852
My name is Percy Jackson and...

1049
01:41:41,459 --> 01:41:44,061
I think you might be looking for this.

1050
01:41:59,110 --> 01:42:02,376
Give me the bolt, lightning thief.

1051
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:16,573
You are wise to
betray your father.

1052
01:42:16,673 --> 01:42:20,990
I didn't steal it. But I have
no connection to Poseidon.

1053
01:42:21,493 --> 01:42:26,346
So tell me. If you didn't
steal it, then who did?

1054
01:42:26,446 --> 01:42:29,937
Luke, son of Hermes.

1055
01:42:33,325 --> 01:42:35,351
You see, he was angry with you.

1056
01:42:35,451 --> 01:42:37,265
All of you.

1057
01:42:37,365 --> 01:42:40,592
He wanted you to
destroy yourselves.

1058
01:42:50,919 --> 01:42:53,128
You have done well.

1059
01:43:05,579 --> 01:43:08,036
Let there be peace!

1060
01:43:12,437 --> 01:43:15,752
- Hi, Mom.
- Annabeth.

1061
01:43:16,552 --> 01:43:18,870
I'm so proud of you.

1062
01:43:21,115 --> 01:43:23,078
Zeus.

1063
01:43:23,178 --> 01:43:28,632
I have a good friend.
He is a satyr named Grover.

1064
01:43:29,034 --> 01:43:30,931
He's my protector and...

1065
01:43:31,031 --> 01:43:35,460
the only reason why escaped the
Underworld is because he stayed behind.

1066
01:43:36,523 --> 01:43:39,891
And now you expect
me to bring him back.

1067
01:43:41,744 --> 01:43:43,682
Very well.

1068
01:43:46,282 --> 01:43:50,043
I believe this assembly's
business here is finished.

1069
01:43:51,373 --> 01:43:53,510
Brother, please.

1070
01:43:53,944 --> 01:43:55,787
I need to speak with him.

1071
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:00,988
Just this once.

1072
01:44:12,707 --> 01:44:15,055
I'll meet you outside.

1073
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:27,612
I'm not expecting you
to forgive me.

1074
01:44:28,817 --> 01:44:31,326
But I want you to
know that I'm grateful.

1075
01:44:31,426 --> 01:44:33,728
I didn't do it for you.

1076
01:44:34,150 --> 01:44:36,436
I did it to save mom.

1077
01:44:42,793 --> 01:44:44,929
Please.

1078
01:44:45,029 --> 01:44:46,963
I don't have much time.

1079
01:44:49,194 --> 01:44:53,139
How old was I when you left?

1080
01:44:53,239 --> 01:44:55,230
Seven months.

1081
01:44:56,555 --> 01:45:00,523
Look I didn't need
you there all the time.

1082
01:45:01,861 --> 01:45:04,811
I would've like to have
seen you just once.

1083
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:10,107
Why didn't you ever come back?

1084
01:45:14,976 --> 01:45:17,115
I wanted to.

1085
01:45:18,610 --> 01:45:20,447
When I was with you
and your mother

1086
01:45:20,547 --> 01:45:24,033
I became less concerned
with my responsibilities.

1087
01:45:24,133 --> 01:45:26,501
I was becoming human.

1088
01:45:28,221 --> 01:45:32,768
- And that's a bad thing?
- To a god? Zeus thinks.

1089
01:45:32,868 --> 01:45:35,067
That's why he pass the law
preventing gods from...

1090
01:45:35,167 --> 01:45:37,649
ever having contact
with their children.

1091
01:45:39,215 --> 01:45:41,366
Only because of you?

1092
01:45:44,819 --> 01:45:46,983
But I was always with you.

1093
01:45:49,010 --> 01:45:52,618
Just because you didn't see me,
doesn't mean that I wasn't there.

1094
01:45:53,506 --> 01:45:56,630
When you're in trouble,
I tried to help.

1095
01:45:57,916 --> 01:46:00,295
I heard you.

1096
01:46:00,395 --> 01:46:03,489
I know I'm not the father
you've always wanted.

1097
01:46:03,589 --> 01:46:06,523
But if you'll ever need me,
I will be there for you.

1098
01:46:07,369 --> 01:46:11,835
In your thoughts.
And in your dreams.

1099
01:46:13,495 --> 01:46:18,312
I will stand by you, Percy.
Always.

1100
01:46:43,837 --> 01:46:46,269
You can come visit me. Anytime.

1101
01:46:46,369 --> 01:46:49,580
Just promise me that I don't have
to see that loser Gabe ever again.

1102
01:46:49,680 --> 01:46:54,915
I kicked him out. Yeah, he's gone.
He's out of our lives forever.

1103
01:46:55,924 --> 01:46:58,252
Finally.

1104
01:47:04,812 --> 01:47:07,320
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Me too.

1105
01:47:14,701 --> 01:47:16,411
Percy?

1106
01:47:17,364 --> 01:47:19,924
This is where you belong.

1107
01:47:35,587 --> 01:47:37,384
Percy, watch out!

1108
01:47:37,484 --> 01:47:39,687
You guys gonna kill the man
who saved the world? Great job!

1109
01:47:39,787 --> 01:47:42,480
All you guys take a
lunch break. Thank you.

1110
01:47:42,899 --> 01:47:45,528
So, the conquering hero
returns triumphant.

1111
01:47:45,628 --> 01:47:48,752
- Grover.
- Have you noticed anything
different about me?

1112
01:47:48,852 --> 01:47:50,230
No.

1113
01:47:50,490 --> 01:47:54,563
Are you sure?
Anything that's improved about me?

1114
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:59,404
No, what? You've been working out?
You got a new cologne? You smell good.

1115
01:47:59,504 --> 01:48:01,519
Look, man. I got my horns!

1116
01:48:01,619 --> 01:48:04,193
I should've seen it the whole time.
Hey, look at that thing.

1117
01:48:04,293 --> 01:48:06,309
You got little horns in your head.
It's crazy.

1118
01:48:06,409 --> 01:48:07,910
Zeus came through.

1119
01:48:08,302 --> 01:48:10,414
I'm now a senior protector,
first class, baby.

1120
01:48:10,514 --> 01:48:14,331
- Congratulations. Definitely, you're one.
- Thank you, man.

1121
01:48:16,334 --> 01:48:19,808
Keep moving. Keep moving.
Don't lose interest.

1122
01:48:19,908 --> 01:48:23,578
One foot in front of the other and the
next thing you know you're running.

1123
01:48:25,646 --> 01:48:27,334
Percy.

1124
01:48:30,069 --> 01:48:33,837
You left the camp, and
disobeyed my orders.

1125
01:48:34,606 --> 01:48:38,306
- Yeah, about that ...
- Which is why ...

1126
01:48:39,261 --> 01:48:41,756
you're my favorite student.

1127
01:48:42,152 --> 01:48:45,662
You can receive all the training
in the world but ultimately

1128
01:48:45,762 --> 01:48:47,985
you have to follow your instincts.

1129
01:48:48,326 --> 01:48:50,209
Grace under pressure.

1130
01:48:53,481 --> 01:48:56,874
Alright. I'm trying to train.
Go suit up.

1131
01:48:56,974 --> 01:48:59,406
You might be a big shot on
Olympus, but down here

1132
01:48:59,506 --> 01:49:02,049
you're still just one of my students.

1133
01:49:02,149 --> 01:49:03,697
Move it.

1134
01:49:05,797 --> 01:49:07,576
Nice horns, Grover.

1135
01:49:07,676 --> 01:49:11,930
It's crazy. We talked.
We dined. We had a great time.

1136
01:49:12,030 --> 01:49:13,413
I'm happy for you, you know.

1137
01:49:13,513 --> 01:49:15,819
Persephone might really like me.
I'm serious.

1138
01:49:21,980 --> 01:49:24,890
You can handle this
one on your own, man.

1139
01:49:25,230 --> 01:49:27,275
Alright, Percy.

1140
01:49:29,990 --> 01:49:32,966
- Good job, Percy.
- Thank you.

1141
01:49:46,410 --> 01:49:48,246
Who's next?

1142
01:49:53,610 --> 01:49:56,058
I think I'd like to give it a shot.

1143
01:50:07,235 --> 01:50:09,521
Welcome home.

1144
01:50:15,242 --> 01:50:17,233
Whoa, whoa, wait!

1145
01:50:17,983 --> 01:50:20,447
First rule of battle strategy:

1146
01:50:20,547 --> 01:50:23,842
Don't ever let your
opponent distract you.
