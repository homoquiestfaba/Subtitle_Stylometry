00:00:38,065 --> 00:00:39,686
It’s the Christmas season,

2
00:00:40,202 --> 00:00:43,065
a time for telling colourful
holiday stories.

3
00:00:43,725 --> 00:00:46,660
My favourite story of all time
is about my grandma.

4
00:00:47,529 --> 00:00:50,183
She had this encounter with a reindeer.

5
00:00:53,485 --> 00:00:56,673
Grandma got run over by a reindeer

6
00:00:57,795 --> 00:01:00,828
walking home from our house Christmas Eve.

7
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,317
You can say there’s no such thing
as Santa,

8
00:01:06,446 --> 00:01:09,605
but as for me and grandpa, we believe.

9
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,245
Grandma got run over by a reindeer,
all right?

10
00:01:13,776 --> 00:01:18,055
And as incredible as it was,
it almost put an end to Christmas.

11
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:20,945
But I’m getting ahead of myself.

12
00:01:20,953 --> 00:01:23,281
So let’s go back to the beginning.

13
00:01:26,194 --> 00:01:31,422
It was December and everyone in Cityville
was caught up in the chaos of the holidays.

14
00:01:32,205 --> 00:01:35,078
And no place was busier
than my grandma’s store.

15
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,102
My grandma’s store!

16
00:01:40,345 --> 00:01:41,564
There it is.

17
00:01:41,655 --> 00:01:44,677
Check it out.
It was a one-of-a-kind place.

18
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:47,220
She carried all kinds of stuff
year around.

19
00:01:48,198 --> 00:01:50,672
She sold decorations, handmade toys –

20
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,146
at least one of anything you could
imagine for the holidays.

21
00:01:55,447 --> 00:01:56,645
There’s grandma.

22
00:01:56,864 --> 00:02:00,688
Did I mention she likes to dress up
to read Christmas stories to kids

23
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,648
while their parents shop?

24
00:02:03,835 --> 00:02:08,334
“And the little baby Christmas tree
looked up at papa tree…” – Grandma!

25
00:02:09,058 --> 00:02:11,444
And that’s me, Jake Spankenheimer.

26
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:14,020
Cousin Mel is scaring away
another customer!

27
00:02:14,193 --> 00:02:17,740
You can stop right there.
That’s shoplifting, missy.

28
00:02:18,066 --> 00:02:20,924
Now, what seems to be the problem?

29
00:02:21,117 --> 00:02:23,169
Problem? No problem.

30
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,459
No money, no merchandise.

31
00:02:25,768 --> 00:02:26,581
No way!

32
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,587
Your credit is always good here, Martha.

33
00:02:29,778 --> 00:02:32,991
Why, you just stop by
when you get your next paycheck.

34
00:02:33,188 --> 00:02:36,001
Thanks, grandma.
Everyone have a merry Christmas!

35
00:02:36,432 --> 00:02:37,332
You, too.

36
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,066
Things have to change.

37
00:02:40,384 --> 00:02:44,115
This store can’t get rich selling
holiday pastries on credit.

38
00:02:44,876 --> 00:02:48,598
You’re not a businesswoman.
You’re an old fruitcake.

39
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:53,908
Everyone else is happy the way things are.
Right, Frank?

40
00:02:54,004 --> 00:02:56,037
Beats punching a time clock
for someone else.

41
00:02:56,038 --> 00:02:58,542
I like spending time with the family at work.

42
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,289
You see, look around you.

43
00:03:00,524 --> 00:03:01,870
We <i>are</i> rich.

44
00:03:02,137 --> 00:03:04,313
Life’s about being nice to people.

45
00:03:04,682 --> 00:03:05,839
Money – ah!

46
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:07,895
I’d say we make enough.

47
00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:08,896
Enough?

48
00:03:09,494 --> 00:03:11,341
Enough is never enough!

49
00:03:19,413 --> 00:03:22,409
A set of replacement wheels
for my rollerblades…

50
00:03:22,858 --> 00:03:24,773
Adding to your Christmas wish list?

51
00:03:25,263 --> 00:03:26,639
Sisters!

52
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:28,651
Ah, yeah, I thought so.

53
00:03:28,735 --> 00:03:31,773
A computer nerd who still
believes in Santa Claus.

54
00:03:31,831 --> 00:03:33,983
You’re so reality challenged.

55
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:38,342
Daphne, stop teasing your brother!

56
00:03:38,657 --> 00:03:40,074
He started it!

57
00:03:42,612 --> 00:03:45,665
Come on downstairs.
Your dad has a surprise.

58
00:03:47,106 --> 00:03:48,232
Tell her, mom.

59
00:03:48,303 --> 00:03:49,826
Santa Claus <i>is</i> real.

60
00:03:49,891 --> 00:03:50,609
Well,

61
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:52,861
there’s no easy answer.

62
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,597
Historically, there was a saint Nick who

63
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,923
with a loving heart filled children’s
shoes with gifts of all sorts.

64
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:04,180
So, Santa today represents
the true meaning of Christmas –

65
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:05,576
giving to others.

66
00:04:09,912 --> 00:04:11,977
Dad, is Santa Claus real?

67
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:15,543
What your mother said.

68
00:04:16,448 --> 00:04:17,935
Hey, who wants to put up a tree?

69
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,917
Oh, right, Christmas tree!

70
00:04:22,727 --> 00:04:24,451
That’s not a Christmas tree.

71
00:04:24,861 --> 00:04:27,732
You’re looking at the new inflatable
Christmas tree manufactured

72
00:04:27,752 --> 00:04:29,987
by the Cityville Own-all Corporation.

73
00:04:30,405 --> 00:04:33,875
But our family always goes out
and gets a real tree.

74
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:36,532
Don’t you want to save the forest?

75
00:04:37,106 --> 00:04:38,944
Nobody gets a tree anymore.

76
00:04:39,143 --> 00:04:40,256
It’s not cool.

77
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:54,363
Wish they had Christmas trees
like that when I was a boy.

78
00:04:55,043 --> 00:04:57,309
Here we go again.

79
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,114
We had to chop our trees down by hand.

80
00:05:00,369 --> 00:05:04,314
Never forget the time I had to use
a beaver for a chain saw.

81
00:05:05,593 --> 00:05:07,971
Last time you told it,
it was a woodpecker.

82
00:05:08,082 --> 00:05:10,289
Okay, everyone, gather ’round your dad.

83
00:05:10,564 --> 00:05:13,641
I want a video of our first
inflatable tree.

84
00:05:14,244 --> 00:05:16,502
This tree is going to save lots of time.

85
00:05:16,796 --> 00:05:18,303
What’s the fun in that?

86
00:05:19,546 --> 00:05:22,094
Where’s the jabbing yourself
with pine needles,

87
00:05:22,175 --> 00:05:27,448
hanging ornaments, the old-fashioned
smell of a genuine douglas fir?

88
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,536
If you like old-fashioned smells
I’ll get my fishing boots.

89
00:05:36,122 --> 00:05:36,863
Oops…

90
00:05:37,345 --> 00:05:38,134
Sorry.

91
00:05:43,862 --> 00:05:45,767
As crazy as things were at home,

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,092
they got crazier the day I met
the most powerful man in Cityville.

93
00:05:51,402 --> 00:05:54,218
– Excuse me. I’m…
– Austin Bucks!

94
00:05:54,585 --> 00:05:58,295
CEO of the Cityville Own-all Corporation.

95
00:05:58,981 --> 00:06:01,072
Grandma says you own everything.

96
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,597
Well, not yet, but that’s why
I want to speak to your grandma.

97
00:06:04,975 --> 00:06:06,659
I’m sure she wants to see you.

98
00:06:07,097 --> 00:06:12,000
But right now, grandma Elfen-heimer
is reading to the kids.

99
00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:13,627
I heard about that.

100
00:06:13,645 --> 00:06:17,173
Say, you wouldn’t happen to have
an extra elf costume I could wear?

101
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:20,084
Nope, sorry. But there’s a troll costume.

102
00:06:24,932 --> 00:06:27,636
Well, grandma Elfenheimer.

103
00:06:27,683 --> 00:06:30,133
Mr. Austin “Troll” Bucks.

104
00:06:30,628 --> 00:06:33,857
I don’t suppose you’re dressed that way
to read “Billy Goats Gruff” to the kids.

105
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:37,522
No. I did it so you’d listen
to my offer to buy your store.

106
00:06:37,585 --> 00:06:39,348
Didn’t help. Don’t want to listen.

107
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,068
I’ll pay a lot of money.

108
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:42,697
Ka-ching!

109
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:45,962
You’d be selling to the biggest
and the best.

110
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,527
Do you know why my company controls
every mall and sidewalk, Santa?

111
00:06:49,846 --> 00:06:53,055
Because people are too busy
to think about Christmas.

112
00:06:53,077 --> 00:06:55,890
With their cellular phones
and fax machines, e-mail

113
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,992
they’re never really away from work.

114
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,870
And you figure you’re helping.

115
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:03,324
Yes. There wouldn’t be a Cityville
Christmas without me.

116
00:07:03,746 --> 00:07:08,105
Your store sits on the perfect place
to build the crown jewel of my empire.

117
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:13,644
Picture it: Gifts delivered on
Christmas Eve by our new sleighmobile.

118
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,059
Isn’t that what Santa does?

119
00:07:17,355 --> 00:07:20,562
How cute. He still believes in
Santa Claus.

120
00:07:20,726 --> 00:07:23,678
Jake, do you think
I should sell the store?

121
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,167
Are you kidding?

122
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,721
I love this place.

123
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,806
You with no store would be like
Christmas without Santa.

124
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:33,851
Well, there you have it –
from the mouths of babes.

125
00:07:35,244 --> 00:07:39,116
Surely you’re not going to let Jake
make such a big decision.

126
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:40,604
He’s just a kid.

127
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,136
In case you change your mind.

128
00:07:44,543 --> 00:07:45,640
Thank you.

129
00:07:46,017 --> 00:07:48,454
And you can keep the troll costume.

130
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,354
Bye-bye.

131
00:07:51,414 --> 00:07:53,896
I’ve always loved a man in tights.

132
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,169
Grandma, do you realize
what you just did?

133
00:08:00,204 --> 00:08:02,615
You let my fortune walk out the door!

134
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,453
That was my future!

135
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:07,483
I mean Jake’s future –

136
00:08:07,803 --> 00:08:12,268
Money for college, travel to Italy,
world cruises, sports cars, jewels…

137
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:16,962
I’d tell you to put a cork in it,
you greedy money-grubber!

138
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:19,296
But grandmas shouldn’t talk that way.

139
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:20,249
Grandma,

140
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,123
if this store were mine,

141
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,350
I’d sell it.

142
00:08:24,573 --> 00:08:27,812
Cousin Mel,
this store will never be yours.

143
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:29,540
Oh, yeah!

144
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:38,084
We’ll see.

145
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,607
Cousin Mel was wrong.

146
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,867
You can keep a store going
on goodwill and baked goods.

147
00:08:45,372 --> 00:08:48,005
By the looks of my house
at Christmas time

148
00:08:48,115 --> 00:08:52,146
you’d think grandma was single-handedly
supplying the entire free world

149
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,655
with Christmas goodies.

150
00:08:53,856 --> 00:08:57,192
The way I see it, you can divide
the world into two groups:

151
00:08:57,409 --> 00:09:00,509
People who like fruitcake,
and all the rest of us.

152
00:09:03,341 --> 00:09:07,944
The holidays were upon us
and things were going fine

153
00:09:08,222 --> 00:09:12,855
till the day I heard the doorbell
and a chill ran up my spine.

154
00:09:13,403 --> 00:09:17,594
I grabbed the wife and children
as the postman wheeled it in.

155
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:22,456
My yearly Christmas nightmare
has just come back again:

156
00:09:22,653 --> 00:09:25,481
It was harder than the head
of uncle Bucky,

157
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,067
heavy as a sermon of preacher Lucky,

158
00:09:28,225 --> 00:09:32,300
one’s enough to give the whole state
of Kentucky a great big bellyache.

159
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:35,571
It was denser than a drove of
barnyard turkeys,

160
00:09:35,654 --> 00:09:38,006
tougher than a truckload of all-beef jerky

161
00:09:38,072 --> 00:09:40,432
drier than a drought in Albuquerque –

162
00:09:40,537 --> 00:09:42,480
grandma’s killer fruitcake.

163
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,190
You’re a great helper, Jake.

164
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,622
Now, just stir that bowl of ingredients
and it’s ready for the oven.

165
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:52,272
Grandma, Jake,
I’m afraid Doofus got out again.

166
00:09:52,295 --> 00:09:54,335
I can’t find him anywhere.

167
00:09:54,656 --> 00:09:58,256
Why, I wonder where that adorable dog
could have run off to this time.

168
00:09:58,591 --> 00:09:59,704
Come on, Jake.

169
00:10:02,805 --> 00:10:05,821
Hah! I don’t know who buys your
cakes and cookies

170
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:08,799
but this will for darn sure
make everyone sick.

171
00:10:09,288 --> 00:10:11,832
That ought to stop people
from shopping at the store

172
00:10:12,168 --> 00:10:17,034
and with no customers you’ll
have to sell, grandma!

173
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:19,585
Doofus was right next to the fireplace.

174
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:22,059
Must have missed him.

175
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,755
What were you saying?
I’d have to sell?

176
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:28,303
Oh, sell a lot, the way
these pastries taste.

177
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:39,828
Careful, grandma. Don’t drink too much
eggnog without your medication.

178
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:43,835
You’d think at my age you’d
outgrow an allergy to eggs.

179
00:10:44,332 --> 00:10:46,626
Now, where’d I put those pills?

180
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,221
I’ve got some mistletoe and holly. Who’s
going to help me with the decorating?

181
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:59,961
– Can’t. Have to call my boyfriend.
– Sorry, grandma, got to dash to the gym.
– Uh, I’d love to, but Frank…

182
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:03,214
The game’s just starting on TV.
– I’ll help you, grandma.

183
00:11:03,352 --> 00:11:04,587
My little man.

184
00:11:05,311 --> 00:11:05,997
Thanks.

185
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,701
Nobody understood me like grandma did.

186
00:11:09,148 --> 00:11:12,292
Christmas time was as important to her
as it was to me.

187
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:19,708
Well, we did it.

188
00:11:19,743 --> 00:11:21,663
That’s right on the nose, Jake.

189
00:11:22,005 --> 00:11:23,007
<i>We</i> did it.

190
00:11:25,522 --> 00:11:28,960
The sooner you go to sleep,
he sooner Santa will come.

191
00:11:29,434 --> 00:11:32,895
Grandma, Daphne says
here’s no such thing as Santa.

192
00:11:33,177 --> 00:11:35,783
Well, that’s because she
doesn’t believe like I do.

193
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,248
Have you ever seen him?

194
00:11:37,274 --> 00:11:43,139
No, but I’ve seen him in the smiles of people
who share with others every Christmas.

195
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:47,865
If you ever run into him, say hi for me.

196
00:11:51,957 --> 00:11:53,207
Good night, Jake.

197
00:11:57,494 --> 00:12:00,667
Grandma got run over by a reindeer

198
00:12:01,861 --> 00:12:04,863
walking home from our house
Christmas Eve.

199
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:09,261
You can say there’s no such thing
as Santa,

200
00:12:10,456 --> 00:12:13,433
but as for me and grandpa, we believe.

201
00:12:13,486 --> 00:12:16,553
Well, I’m fixing to take these
extra cookies and cakes

202
00:12:16,565 --> 00:12:19,885
to the volunteers at the Cityville
community services building.

203
00:12:19,962 --> 00:12:21,993
It’s too late to go out now, grandma.

204
00:12:22,044 --> 00:12:25,159
If I’d had some help I would have been
finished hours ago.

205
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:28,713
– I was busy.
– Sorry, had to finish my homework.
– Last-minute shopping.

206
00:12:30,864 --> 00:12:33,038
You’ve been drinking too much eggnog.

207
00:12:34,836 --> 00:12:36,978
– Please, don’t go!
– We’re begging!

208
00:12:40,068 --> 00:12:42,149
Besides, I left my medication
at the store.

209
00:12:58,981 --> 00:13:01,788
On, Donner! On, Blitzen!

210
00:13:03,673 --> 00:13:05,790
It’s him! Santa Claus!

211
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:07,565
He is real!

212
00:13:09,806 --> 00:13:11,569
Grandma, watch out!

213
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:30,125
Come on, everyone!

214
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:33,857
Hurry! Grandma got run over
by Santa’s reindeer!

215
00:13:34,327 --> 00:13:38,951
– Jake, close the door and get in here.
– Santa hit grandma! Grandma needs help!

216
00:13:39,255 --> 00:13:42,622
The only person who needs
help in this family is you.

217
00:13:43,047 --> 00:13:45,706
Now, Jake, calm down. Take a breath.

218
00:13:46,888 --> 00:13:49,400
Okay, Santa Claus was
flying low like this.

219
00:13:49,613 --> 00:13:53,572
And grandma was walking like this
and … is here, and …

220
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:56,089
Now, honey, you must have had
a bad dream.

221
00:13:56,128 --> 00:14:00,189
In case you haven’t noticed, Frank, your
son suffers from a dreaded affliction.

222
00:14:00,428 --> 00:14:03,383
– What affliction?
– The Santa Claus is real syndrome.

223
00:14:03,752 --> 00:14:05,182
He’s got all the symptoms:

224
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:09,036
Writing lists to Santa, checking them
twice, good behavior,

225
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:12,802
falling asleep before midnight.
I figure he gets it from his grandma.

226
00:14:12,882 --> 00:14:15,409
You saw what happened, didn’t you,
grandpa?

227
00:14:18,302 --> 00:14:20,503
I’m sorry. Were you talking to me?

228
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:24,818
I was too busy watching grandma get
run over by a reindeer-drawn sleigh.

229
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:25,977
Yes!

230
00:14:26,237 --> 00:14:28,773
What a sight!
Sleigh come out of nowhere.

231
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:32,763
Grandma takes a header into the
snowbank. Sleigh vanishes…

232
00:14:33,185 --> 00:14:35,514
like the ghost of Christmas past!

233
00:14:36,374 --> 00:14:40,877
And that’s what’s called an advanced
case of Santa Claus is real syndrome.

234
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:43,012
Oh, honestly, grandpa.

235
00:14:43,156 --> 00:14:45,433
We’ve got to go help grandma!

236
00:14:49,338 --> 00:14:51,046
Nothing is out there.

237
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:53,308
Frank, do something.

238
00:14:53,773 --> 00:14:57,281
Look, Jake, if I call the local shelter
and have grandma speak to you

239
00:14:57,703 --> 00:14:58,910
will you go to bed?

240
00:14:58,951 --> 00:15:00,293
But she won’t!

241
00:15:00,742 --> 00:15:01,815
I saw her!

242
00:15:02,092 --> 00:15:05,210
I told you Santa hit her with his sleigh!

243
00:15:05,512 --> 00:15:06,821
Call the police!

244
00:15:09,881 --> 00:15:11,582
That’s right, officer.
Missing.

245
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,004
Hit by Santa’s sleigh.

246
00:15:15,385 --> 00:15:17,329
Yes, we’ve been drinking eggnog.

247
00:15:19,525 --> 00:15:21,892
They’ll be out first thing in the morning.

248
00:15:23,934 --> 00:15:25,847
And what did you see, young man?

249
00:15:26,178 --> 00:15:28,849
I saw grandma get run over by a reindeer.

250
00:15:29,306 --> 00:15:30,997
Here we go again.

251
00:15:31,273 --> 00:15:33,957
Sorry, son, impossible.
Right here in the manual.

252
00:15:33,971 --> 00:15:36,170
There’s no such thing as Santa Claus.

253
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,277
Is, too.

254
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,218
We got a code 12-25:
Santa Claus is real syndrome –

255
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,205
family dispute.
– Come on!

256
00:15:43,315 --> 00:15:45,441
I’ll show you where she got run over.

257
00:15:47,807 --> 00:15:50,552
When we found her Christmas morning

258
00:15:52,346 --> 00:15:54,515
at the scene of the attack…
– See?

259
00:15:56,635 --> 00:15:59,471
… she had hoofprints on her forehead

260
00:16:00,053 --> 00:16:03,248
and incriminating Claus marks
on her back.

261
00:16:03,761 --> 00:16:07,079
Okay, we’ve got some reindeer hoofprints
and sleigh tread marks leading to a…

262
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,207
Oh, yeah!

263
00:16:08,237 --> 00:16:11,777
What appears to be an impression of a
person in the snow, look there. But, uh…

264
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,270
How do we know it’s grandma?
– Doofus knows!

265
00:16:19,985 --> 00:16:21,825
That’s one of grandma’s shoes.

266
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:24,876
That’s her special Christmas mug.

267
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,783
Her medicine.

268
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,803
And her cookies and…

269
00:16:31,972 --> 00:16:33,278
her fruitcake!

270
00:16:40,538 --> 00:16:42,313
Officer Lyon, check this out.

271
00:16:42,404 --> 00:16:44,225
Ooh, what do you make of this?

272
00:16:44,473 --> 00:16:49,164
Offhand, I’d say that’s animal hair.
Reindeer, 15-hands high, 12-point buck.

273
00:16:49,405 --> 00:16:54,657
By the markings, a sleigh-puller. Powerful,
capable of flight, age unknown, one of a…

274
00:16:55,078 --> 00:16:56,563
But it’s just a guess.

275
00:16:56,928 --> 00:17:00,652
Okay, then. I’ll just put it down
as sleighicular hit-and-run.

276
00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:02,383
What’s the code for that?

277
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,200
You should remember that one.
It’s a 12-24.

278
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:07,935
Oh, right, 12-24.

279
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:09,338
I get it.

280
00:17:09,346 --> 00:17:11,372
12-24: Day before Christmas.

281
00:17:11,392 --> 00:17:13,054
Just a minute, Sherlock.

282
00:17:13,094 --> 00:17:16,856
Before you put out an APB for a sleigh
driven by Santa Claus –

283
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,842
who, may I remind you, does not exist –

284
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:22,024
I’d like to know where grandma is.

285
00:17:22,345 --> 00:17:24,895
Good point. We can work
the Santa angle later.

286
00:17:25,343 --> 00:17:27,146
Better get looking for the old broad.

287
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,825
We’ll need a photo of the missing person.

288
00:17:31,977 --> 00:17:35,326
That started the biggest grandma hunt
in Cityville history.

289
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:38,586
The police searched every
nook and cranny for granny.

290
00:17:38,865 --> 00:17:41,599
Time passed, and police kept
looking and looking.

291
00:17:41,952 --> 00:17:43,175
Months went by.

292
00:17:43,427 --> 00:17:44,891
We looked and looked.

293
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,376
I even got permission to put
grandma’s picture on milk cartons.

294
00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:53,335
Nothing helped, not even stories
on the local news channel.

295
00:17:54,027 --> 00:17:56,396
Grandma was nowhere to be found.

296
00:17:59,956 --> 00:18:04,144
Grandma’s Christmas gifts remained
unopened and people dressed in black.

297
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:08,941
Grandpa tried to cope by playing cards
with cousin Mel.

298
00:18:10,801 --> 00:18:14,801
It wasn’t any better at the store,
either. Mom and dad tried their best.

299
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:18,076
But without grandma,
customers stopped coming in.

300
00:18:22,111 --> 00:18:24,442
My office said you called
and wanted to see me.

301
00:18:24,825 --> 00:18:29,170
I wanted to apologize for the way
grandma treated you last year.

302
00:18:30,123 --> 00:18:32,957
Did anyone ever tell you’re very good
looking for a man with…

303
00:18:33,436 --> 00:18:34,813
… deep pockets?

304
00:18:39,003 --> 00:18:40,259
I was dusting.

305
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,365
Well, go dust somewhere else!

306
00:18:42,612 --> 00:18:45,619
You can’t tell me what to do.
It’s grandma’s store.

307
00:18:49,034 --> 00:18:53,978
That reminds me, are you still interested
in buying this establishment?

308
00:18:54,043 --> 00:18:57,261
Well, it’s the ideal location for our
sleighmobile division.

309
00:18:57,384 --> 00:19:01,171
Good, because I know grandma
would want me to sell it.

310
00:19:01,236 --> 00:19:02,920
I have the deed right here.

311
00:19:04,901 --> 00:19:08,638
Unfortunately, your name’s not on the
deed, just grandma and grandpa’s.

312
00:19:08,704 --> 00:19:12,208
But if grandpa agrees,
then I could buy the store.

313
00:19:12,269 --> 00:19:16,501
I’m sure I can trick… I mean,
get grandpa to agree.

314
00:19:22,677 --> 00:19:25,445
You’ve been so depressed
since grandma disappeared.

315
00:19:25,851 --> 00:19:30,494
That’s why I had you bring me to my
favorite restaurant to cheer you up.

316
00:19:31,056 --> 00:19:32,518
I’ll cure your sorrow.

317
00:19:32,903 --> 00:19:36,641
We’ll spruce up the store, order
new merchandise, hire a baker.

318
00:19:36,682 --> 00:19:39,885
It’s right here in these papers.
All you have to do is sign.

319
00:19:40,384 --> 00:19:41,114
Sing?

320
00:19:41,421 --> 00:19:42,526
No, sign.

321
00:19:42,812 --> 00:19:43,601
Sure.

322
00:19:43,774 --> 00:19:44,926
So, sign.

323
00:19:45,611 --> 00:19:46,816
I’d rather sing.

324
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:55,915
Grandma’s spending Christmas
with the superstars

325
00:19:55,935 --> 00:19:59,296
since that reindeer ran her down
that fateful night .

326
00:20:00,952 --> 00:20:05,025
Grandma’s hanging out
with all those late, great stars

327
00:20:05,042 --> 00:20:08,819
for the heavenliest Christmas of her life.

328
00:20:09,151 --> 00:20:13,171
She’s standing under the mistletoe
with Elvis.

329
00:20:13,766 --> 00:20:17,468
He’s been consoling her
because she’s missing gramps.

330
00:20:18,322 --> 00:20:22,786
Then Elvis offers her the keys
to a new Cadillac,

331
00:20:22,837 --> 00:20:26,527
well, well, and a couple of sheets
of Elvis postage stamps.

332
00:20:28,184 --> 00:20:32,058
Grandma’s spending Christmas
with the superstars

333
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:35,550
since that reindeer ran her down
that fateful night.

334
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:41,163
Grandma’s hanging out
with all those late, great stars

335
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:44,729
for the heavenliest Christmas
of her life.

336
00:20:50,203 --> 00:20:51,943
Okay, I’ll sign.

337
00:20:52,057 --> 00:20:54,294
Oh, this is easier than I thought.

338
00:20:54,682 --> 00:20:57,530
Sign here and here. Initial this.

339
00:20:57,904 --> 00:21:01,244
Oh, and this one gives me power
of attorney over your affairs.

340
00:21:01,283 --> 00:21:04,826
I’ll be your dedicated money manager
forever.

341
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:06,965
I do feel better.

342
00:21:07,202 --> 00:21:08,097
Perfect!

343
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:16,250
This is it. The last of grandma’s
fruitcakes from last Christmas.

344
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:19,850
Oh, do you think it’s still good?
Did she use preservatives?

345
00:21:20,102 --> 00:21:22,646
Preservatives? It’s a fruitcake.

346
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:26,209
What do we do when it’s sold?

347
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:28,702
Nothing!

348
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,596
Because we’re going to be rich!

349
00:21:31,801 --> 00:21:33,265
We won the lottery!

350
00:21:33,328 --> 00:21:36,343
– We’re going to be rich?
– We’re going to be rich!

351
00:21:36,381 --> 00:21:37,596
We could retire?

352
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,262
What’s going on?

353
00:21:39,596 --> 00:21:43,432
Our boat’s come in.
Cousin Mel says we won the lottery!

354
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:46,782
– Won the lottery? All right!
– Sort of.

355
00:21:47,828 --> 00:21:51,735
Actually, I’m going over to see Austin
Bucks and sell this dump for millions.

356
00:21:51,972 --> 00:21:54,798
Thank grandpa.
He gave me power of attorney.

357
00:21:55,924 --> 00:21:56,776
Do what?

358
00:21:57,068 --> 00:21:58,315
Grandpa!

359
00:21:58,648 --> 00:22:00,490
How could you do that?

360
00:22:01,052 --> 00:22:03,003
I thought I was helping.

361
00:22:03,544 --> 00:22:06,579
Talk about having your cake
and eating it, too.

362
00:22:08,542 --> 00:22:09,991
I’ve got to stop her.

363
00:22:37,182 --> 00:22:39,261
Mr. Buck’s office – which way?

364
00:22:44,123 --> 00:22:46,121
Jake! Nice stop.

365
00:22:46,672 --> 00:22:49,469
Please, please don’t buy grandma’s store.

366
00:22:49,686 --> 00:22:54,299
Too late, kid. With this last piece of
property Mr. Bucks will own all of Cityville.

367
00:22:54,701 --> 00:22:55,735
Who are you?

368
00:22:56,238 --> 00:22:58,830
Cousin Mel’s attorney, I. M. Slime.

369
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:01,106
You said it, not me.

370
00:23:02,607 --> 00:23:03,766
Sorry, Jake.

371
00:23:04,131 --> 00:23:07,167
The only person who can stop this sale
is your grandma but

372
00:23:07,245 --> 00:23:09,227
no one knows what happened to her.

373
00:23:09,243 --> 00:23:11,499
She got run over by Santa’s reindeer.

374
00:23:11,994 --> 00:23:14,274
I just need more time to find grandma.

375
00:23:14,699 --> 00:23:18,093
Now, Austin, darling, why don’t we go
somewhere romantic

376
00:23:18,094 --> 00:23:20,114
and consummate this deal?

377
00:23:23,575 --> 00:23:27,476
You got it, kid. This deal doesn’t
close till the end of the week.

378
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,068
No!

379
00:23:29,444 --> 00:23:32,572
You’re an attorney. Do something!
Sue somebody!

380
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,656
A bit of advice.

381
00:23:34,857 --> 00:23:39,139
If you really believe grandma was run over
by Santa’s reindeer then find him.

382
00:23:39,455 --> 00:23:41,357
He should know where grandma is.

383
00:23:42,266 --> 00:23:43,907
Okay, I will!

384
00:23:49,851 --> 00:23:54,490
I have till the end of the week to stop
cousin Mel from selling grandma’s store.

385
00:23:54,812 --> 00:23:58,066
Look, Sherlock. You’ve tried your best
to find grandma.

386
00:23:58,306 --> 00:24:00,042
Your room is search central.

387
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:03,129
You got no results from your
do-it-yourself police sketch.

388
00:24:03,521 --> 00:24:06,314
Your dry erase board is full of
dead-end clues.

389
00:24:07,235 --> 00:24:08,573
Give it up.

390
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,850
You’re right, Doofus, we can’t give up.

391
00:24:31,354 --> 00:24:32,383
What’s this?

392
00:24:33,034 --> 00:24:35,020
Printout of my old Christmas list?

393
00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:40,241
Look, Doofus, it’s not as simple as adding
“find grandma” to my Christmas list

394
00:24:40,433 --> 00:24:42,681
and e-mailing it to Santa Claus.

395
00:24:43,223 --> 00:24:43,941
Wait.

396
00:24:45,216 --> 00:24:46,963
Doofus, you’re a genius!

397
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:52,103
To Santa Claus @SantaClausIsReal.com.

398
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,440
Quincy, you better see this.

399
00:25:31,147 --> 00:25:31,869
None.

400
00:25:32,047 --> 00:25:34,120
Not a single letter from Cityville.

401
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,349
It’s as if they’re too busy
with their prefabricated,

402
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,252
mass-produced lives to need me anymore.

403
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:41,484
Excuse me.

404
00:25:41,524 --> 00:25:45,717
I might as well shave my beard
and cancel the holidays in Cityville.

405
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:49,683
If I could meet just one stinking person

406
00:25:49,695 --> 00:25:52,748
who understands the holidays are about
human kindness

407
00:25:52,913 --> 00:25:55,440
with only a touch of conspicuous
consumption.

408
00:25:59,105 --> 00:26:01,174
Yes, Quincy? What’s this?

409
00:26:01,722 --> 00:26:02,880
Careful, Royce.

410
00:26:03,487 --> 00:26:06,409
Donna wanted a doll with braids with
a red ribbon.

411
00:26:06,685 --> 00:26:08,014
She’s on the good list.

412
00:26:11,147 --> 00:26:14,030
The mystery of grandma X is solved.

413
00:26:17,266 --> 00:26:18,966
Grandma Spankenheimer?

414
00:26:19,337 --> 00:26:21,357
Grandma Spankenheimer?

415
00:26:21,562 --> 00:26:22,674
Spankenheimer?

416
00:26:25,201 --> 00:26:28,465
No, never met her. But you might ask
one of those short fellers.

417
00:26:28,483 --> 00:26:31,357
Classic case of amnesia.
Can’t remember a thing.

418
00:26:31,811 --> 00:26:34,558
The Christmas lights are on but
nobody’s home.

419
00:26:35,035 --> 00:26:37,148
E-mail a reply immediately!

420
00:26:40,585 --> 00:26:42,774
I have a better idea.

421
00:27:04,086 --> 00:27:05,502
Call off the hound!

422
00:27:08,219 --> 00:27:09,897
Hi, I’m Quincy,

423
00:27:10,071 --> 00:27:11,110
Santa’s elf.

424
00:27:11,487 --> 00:27:12,942
Top elf, to be exact.

425
00:27:13,252 --> 00:27:15,789
I fly right seat on the sleigh.

426
00:27:16,104 --> 00:27:20,617
The man in the red suit doesn’t make
a move without consulting me first.

427
00:27:20,983 --> 00:27:22,139
You’re an elf.

428
00:27:22,668 --> 00:27:24,147
The genuine article.

429
00:27:29,538 --> 00:27:31,672
What are you doing here in September?

430
00:27:31,971 --> 00:27:33,585
I came to ask a question.

431
00:27:34,127 --> 00:27:36,208
Would you like to find your grandma?

432
00:27:36,418 --> 00:27:39,089
More than all the presents in the world.

433
00:27:39,178 --> 00:27:40,353
Then follow me.

434
00:27:43,345 --> 00:27:46,331
Grandpa, I’m going to the North Pole
to find grandma.

435
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:48,501
Fine, thanks for telling me.

436
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:03,397
Old St. Nick and Mrs. Claus

437
00:28:03,654 --> 00:28:05,712
decided just this year:

438
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,237
there won’t be any Christmas –

439
00:28:09,077 --> 00:28:11,212
the feeling’s just not here.

440
00:28:12,022 --> 00:28:14,365
Some kids get more than they need

441
00:28:14,744 --> 00:28:16,711
and some are spoiled rotten.

442
00:28:17,494 --> 00:28:19,819
And when it comes to Christmas time

443
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,551
too many are forgotten.

444
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:25,800
It will feel like Christmas

445
00:28:25,902 --> 00:28:27,950
to people everywhere,

446
00:28:28,529 --> 00:28:31,194
it will feel like Christmas

447
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,617
when we all learn to share.

448
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:36,695
Santa said to Mrs. Claus

449
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:39,232
“Something’s way off track –

450
00:28:39,764 --> 00:28:41,841
I can’t get into Christmas

451
00:28:42,409 --> 00:28:44,575
until the spirit’s back.”

452
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,255
It will feel like Christmas

453
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,551
to people everywhere,

454
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:53,782
it will feel like Christmas

455
00:28:53,954 --> 00:28:56,458
when we all learn to share.

456
00:29:02,671 --> 00:29:06,441
You better have a good reason
why you broke elf code

457
00:29:06,652 --> 00:29:08,486
and brought a human here.

458
00:29:09,033 --> 00:29:11,699
Thought you’d like to meet
Jake Spankenheimer.

459
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,195
The Jake Spankenheimer who loves
rollerblades,

460
00:29:15,258 --> 00:29:17,564
video games, pillow fights
with his sister,

461
00:29:17,643 --> 00:29:21,189
procrastinates once in a while with his
homework – not that I condone it –,

462
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:25,513
writes to me every Christmas
and helps his grandma in the kitchen?

463
00:29:25,902 --> 00:29:30,736
It’s nice to finally meet someone from
Cityville who still believes in me.

464
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:33,144
Pretty cool.

465
00:29:33,391 --> 00:29:36,190
Which is why you’re not sweeping up
reindeer chips.

466
00:29:39,365 --> 00:29:42,381
Grandma, there’s someone here
who wants to see you.

467
00:29:44,294 --> 00:29:45,303
Grandma!

468
00:29:51,631 --> 00:29:53,201
Okay, I’ll bite. Who is he?

469
00:29:56,013 --> 00:29:58,423
It’s me, Jake.  Don’t you remember?

470
00:30:00,642 --> 00:30:01,818
No, nothin’.

471
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:03,086
Wait…

472
00:30:04,514 --> 00:30:06,607
No. Thought I had somethin’.

473
00:30:07,211 --> 00:30:08,719
You’ve got to remember.

474
00:30:08,947 --> 00:30:10,539
Cousin Mel’s taking over.

475
00:30:10,693 --> 00:30:11,949
Who’s cousin Mel?

476
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,790
You know, big red hair, greedy,
moneygrubbing,

477
00:30:15,835 --> 00:30:18,649
too much jewelry, beats grandpa at cards.

478
00:30:18,675 --> 00:30:20,505
She doesn’t sound very nice.

479
00:30:21,144 --> 00:30:22,081
She isn’t.

480
00:30:22,482 --> 00:30:26,689
If you don’t come back right away she’s
going to sell your store to Mr. Bucks.

481
00:30:27,188 --> 00:30:30,920
Without it, our family and Christmas
will never be the same.

482
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:32,600
That’s terrible.

483
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,616
Who are you again?

484
00:30:35,703 --> 00:30:38,010
Will you come back with me
and stop the sale?

485
00:30:38,428 --> 00:30:41,134
Better than laying around here all day
getting fat.

486
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,598
Oh, yeah!

487
00:30:42,965 --> 00:30:45,340
Quincy, hook up the reindeer to the sleigh.

488
00:30:45,658 --> 00:30:47,279
We’re headed to the city.

489
00:30:54,713 --> 00:30:55,650
Turn here.

490
00:30:57,435 --> 00:30:58,941
We’re here!

491
00:30:59,356 --> 00:31:00,724
Better park in back.

492
00:31:02,514 --> 00:31:04,870
Cousin Mel wasn’t about
to give up easily.

493
00:31:05,953 --> 00:31:09,443
I remember what happened next.
It was a warm, September day.

494
00:31:14,516 --> 00:31:15,927
That was a landin’.

495
00:31:16,318 --> 00:31:19,796
I better sit here till my stomach
catches up to the rest of me.

496
00:31:20,176 --> 00:31:21,725
There’s no time, grandma.

497
00:31:22,927 --> 00:31:24,784
Quincy, keep an eye on things.

498
00:31:25,377 --> 00:31:26,480
Right, boss.

499
00:31:30,485 --> 00:31:31,552
It’s grandma!

500
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:33,734
She’s supposed to be missing.

501
00:31:33,877 --> 00:31:36,155
Ah, this ruins everything.

502
00:31:36,341 --> 00:31:41,005
Mr. Bucks will call off the deal.
There goes your fortune and my 50 percent.

503
00:31:41,348 --> 00:31:44,230
– Ten percent.
– Thirty percent! Plus expenses.

504
00:31:44,818 --> 00:31:45,589
Done.

505
00:31:47,878 --> 00:31:49,138
I’ve got an idea.

506
00:31:49,613 --> 00:31:52,190
You just make sure grandma stays missing.

507
00:32:10,323 --> 00:32:11,702
Hey! Hey! Come back!

508
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,434
Grandma Spankenheimer?

509
00:32:17,695 --> 00:32:21,272
Yes, they sent me down to get you.
Now, if you’ll just follow me?

510
00:32:21,513 --> 00:32:22,624
Sure, sweetie.

511
00:32:22,932 --> 00:32:25,818
Say, you wouldn’t happen to have any antacid?

512
00:32:29,701 --> 00:32:30,425
Wait!

513
00:32:31,018 --> 00:32:34,021
Mr. Bucks, you can’t buy the store
from cousin Mel.

514
00:32:34,551 --> 00:32:36,014
It’s not hers to sell.

515
00:32:36,385 --> 00:32:37,599
I found grandma.

516
00:32:37,788 --> 00:32:39,397
She’s waiting downstairs.

517
00:32:39,567 --> 00:32:41,488
Santa will explain everything.

518
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,515
Sorry.

519
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:49,701
Used to chimneys, not stairs.

520
00:32:49,776 --> 00:32:51,542
Fill them in while I get grandma.

521
00:32:52,492 --> 00:32:54,990
And, uh, you would be?

522
00:32:55,156 --> 00:32:56,235
Santa Claus.

523
00:33:00,493 --> 00:33:02,821
You know – ho-ho-ho!

524
00:33:03,123 --> 00:33:06,452
Not to embarrass you, but I’m afraid
anybody can put on a big red suit,

525
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:10,365
false beard and call themselves
Santa Claus. They all work for me.

526
00:33:12,247 --> 00:33:13,720
You’re Austin Bucks!

527
00:33:13,751 --> 00:33:17,767
When you were six years old, you wanted
a Lieutenant Neutron action figure.

528
00:33:18,442 --> 00:33:19,770
Lieutenant Neutron?

529
00:33:19,924 --> 00:33:21,260
He was the best!

530
00:33:21,915 --> 00:33:25,567
– Hey, how did you know that?
– I’m Santa. It’s what I do.

531
00:33:26,416 --> 00:33:27,630
Amazing!

532
00:33:28,262 --> 00:33:29,851
Unbelievable.

533
00:33:30,606 --> 00:33:32,594
So what <i>did</i> happen to grandma?

534
00:33:32,642 --> 00:33:34,982
I was makin’ my usual rounds…

535
00:33:35,902 --> 00:33:38,246
On, Donner! On, Dasher!

536
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:41,354
Something made my reindeer
go wha-ha!

537
00:33:41,678 --> 00:33:42,820
Wha-ha!

538
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,156
Follow me, guys!

539
00:33:44,614 --> 00:33:45,998
I tried to stop them.

540
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,757
But nothing worked.

541
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:50,759
Then everything went black.

542
00:33:51,967 --> 00:33:56,099
I’m terribly sorry. I don’t know
what got into those reindeer.

543
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:57,897
Who are you?

544
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:01,108
Oh, I better get you medical attention.
Quincy!

545
00:34:01,396 --> 00:34:03,590
Leave a note explaining what happened.

546
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:08,754
So, of course, she was welcome to stay
at the North Pole until she felt better.

547
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:11,115
We’ve got great medical care –

548
00:34:11,321 --> 00:34:16,234
every therapy and treatment imaginable
at no ho-ho-ho! cost.

549
00:34:17,593 --> 00:34:19,802
Thanks for straightening out this
whole mess, Santa.

550
00:34:19,905 --> 00:34:22,802
I’m eager to see grandma and tell her
the sale is off.

551
00:34:24,543 --> 00:34:27,851
– Sure glad everything worked out okay.
– I… I’m sorry.

552
00:34:27,871 --> 00:34:31,318
I had to chase the reindeer.
I was gone for a minute.

553
00:34:31,642 --> 00:34:33,136
She wandered off.

554
00:34:33,594 --> 00:34:35,194
– Who?
– Grandma!

555
00:34:35,557 --> 00:34:37,399
We couldn’t find her anywhere.

556
00:34:37,423 --> 00:34:39,375
She’s missing again.

557
00:34:40,182 --> 00:34:42,281
Since grandma is nowhere to be found

558
00:34:42,491 --> 00:34:45,400
and the man in the red suit here
admitted he ran over her

559
00:34:45,587 --> 00:34:49,239
I demand that you have Santa arrested
for the disappearance of grandma.

560
00:34:49,555 --> 00:34:50,717
No!

561
00:34:56,064 --> 00:35:00,233
The news that Santa had been arrested for
the disappearance of grandma was a shock,

562
00:35:00,518 --> 00:35:02,475
especially to Mrs. Claus.

563
00:35:03,285 --> 00:35:04,992
Santa’s been arrested!

564
00:35:08,116 --> 00:35:12,136
I shouldn’t say everyone was shocked
because cousin Mel and her partner in crime

565
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:14,970
Ms. Slime, sure weren’t.

566
00:35:15,263 --> 00:35:16,156
Here.

567
00:35:18,048 --> 00:35:21,877
Lucky a thing she still has a case of
amnesia and doesn’t know who you are.

568
00:35:22,067 --> 00:35:26,340
Lucky is right but we can’t keep her
locked up in here forever.

569
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:27,678
Won’t need to.

570
00:35:27,737 --> 00:35:30,431
We just need to keep her out of sight
long enough

571
00:35:30,434 --> 00:35:33,886
for the jury to find Santa Claus
guilty of her disappearance.

572
00:35:34,889 --> 00:35:37,095
And then we sue him for all that money.

573
00:35:37,165 --> 00:35:39,159
Think of it: Santa’s found guilty,

574
00:35:39,326 --> 00:35:42,100
we win the world’s most famous
case of hit-and-run.

575
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:45,298
Santa Claus must be worth a fortune,

576
00:35:45,681 --> 00:35:48,667
considering he supplies gifts
to everyone in the world.

577
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:51,499
That’s 2.5 billion times.

578
00:35:54,299 --> 00:35:58,560
What do you think he spends on average
per person? $10, $15?

579
00:35:58,786 --> 00:36:00,387
Even if it’s just five –

580
00:36:00,688 --> 00:36:04,245
your share, as grandpa’s financial
advisor, is…

581
00:36:11,221 --> 00:36:14,328
Grandpa’s gonna sue the pants off of Santa,

582
00:36:14,552 --> 00:36:16,371
that’s what grandpa’s gonna do

583
00:36:14,552 --> 00:36:16,466
that’s what grandpa’s gonna do.

584
00:36:17,797 --> 00:36:20,911
Grandpa’s gonna sue the pants off of Santa

585
00:36:20,923 --> 00:36:23,093
’cause grandma would’ve wanted him to.

586
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,542
Grandpa’s gonna sue the pants off of Santa,

587
00:36:27,593 --> 00:36:29,955
he knows the law is on his side.

588
00:36:30,884 --> 00:36:34,242
Grandpa’s gonna sue the pants off of Santa,

589
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,269
Santa’s going for a ride.

590
00:36:37,724 --> 00:36:40,791
Grandpa’s gonna sue the pants off of Santa,

591
00:36:40,945 --> 00:36:43,008
that’s what grandpa’s gonna do.

592
00:36:44,323 --> 00:36:47,395
Grandpa’s gonna sue the pants off of Santa

593
00:36:47,426 --> 00:36:49,430
’cause grandma would’ve wanted him to.

594
00:36:49,482 --> 00:36:50,924
No pantalones.

595
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,047
Grandpa’s gonna sue the pants off of Santa,

596
00:36:54,075 --> 00:36:56,592
he knows the law is on his side.

597
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,654
Grandpa’s gonna sue the pants off of Santa,

598
00:37:00,868 --> 00:37:02,840
Santa’s going for a ride.

599
00:37:02,886 --> 00:37:04,902
Santa’s going for a ride.

600
00:37:04,993 --> 00:37:06,981
Santa’s going for a ride.

601
00:37:11,148 --> 00:37:15,670
I’m at the courthouse where the sensational
Santa Claus trial is reaching its climax.

602
00:37:15,765 --> 00:37:19,884
It’s already December and after weeks
of testimony by several witnesses

603
00:37:20,345 --> 00:37:21,869
three questions remain:

604
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:24,343
Did Santa’s reindeer run over grandma?

605
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,810
Where is she now?

606
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:29,088
And without Santa Claus,
will there be a Christmas?

607
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:32,499
District attorney Hartung is making
his impassioned summation.

608
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,010
And so, in closing do I want to see
Santa Claus go to jail?

609
00:37:37,437 --> 00:37:38,595
Personally, no,

610
00:37:38,907 --> 00:37:41,789
but I represent the state and must do my job.

611
00:37:42,453 --> 00:37:47,476
The evidence proves Santa Claus is
responsible for grandma’s disappearance.

612
00:37:47,754 --> 00:37:50,426
So if the beard fits, you must convict.

613
00:37:53,348 --> 00:37:56,716
If he goes to jail,
it will be the end of Christmas.

614
00:37:57,115 --> 00:37:58,625
What can I do, grandpa?

615
00:37:58,917 --> 00:38:00,791
Find grandma again.

616
00:38:01,229 --> 00:38:02,953
Maybe she didn’t wander off.

617
00:38:03,049 --> 00:38:04,820
But everyone loves grandma.

618
00:38:05,314 --> 00:38:06,962
Who would do such a thing?

619
00:38:09,826 --> 00:38:11,470
Cousin Mel!

620
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:16,555
Hey, boy, whatcha smell?

621
00:38:17,306 --> 00:38:18,176
Grandma?

622
00:38:18,382 --> 00:38:21,237
Jake, get that mutt away from my backpack.

623
00:38:21,442 --> 00:38:22,722
Sure, cousin Mel.

624
00:38:27,525 --> 00:38:28,565
Okay, Doofus,

625
00:38:28,834 --> 00:38:30,494
do your smell thing.

626
00:38:32,928 --> 00:38:34,252
Keep it up, Doofus.

627
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,550
So that’s where she was going.

628
00:38:53,052 --> 00:38:55,044
Won’t be too much longer, grandma.

629
00:38:55,254 --> 00:38:58,467
The jury is about to find your friend
in the red suit guilty.

630
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,448
And who would that be?

631
00:39:00,468 --> 00:39:03,077
You still don’t remember a thing, do you?

632
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,951
My plan is going to work.

633
00:39:10,061 --> 00:39:14,052
I’m going to be wealthy
and there’s no one who can stop me.

634
00:39:14,582 --> 00:39:16,254
Hello, inside!

635
00:39:16,491 --> 00:39:18,222
Who can that be way out here?

636
00:39:18,479 --> 00:39:21,029
How should I know?
I don’t even know who I am.

637
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:25,236
If that’s your car parked down by the road
you better check it out.

638
00:39:25,383 --> 00:39:27,553
Some bears are hanging around it.

639
00:39:27,628 --> 00:39:29,889
Thank you! I was leaving anyway!

640
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,117
Okay, but don’t take too long.

641
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:35,094
Have a safe, fire-free day.

642
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,469
Good job!

643
00:39:51,698 --> 00:39:54,512
I came as soon as I received your e-mail,
Master Jake.

644
00:39:54,864 --> 00:39:57,717
Now what do you have up your sleeve
to get me inside?

645
00:40:09,308 --> 00:40:10,522
Nice entrance!

646
00:40:10,945 --> 00:40:13,794
What’s your name again?
– Jake Spankenheimer.

647
00:40:13,885 --> 00:40:15,055
Your grandson.

648
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:18,854
Doesn’t ring a bell but thanks, anyway.

649
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:21,530
Don’t thank me, thank Doofus.

650
00:40:23,676 --> 00:40:27,375
And I suppose this overexcited
pooch is Doofus.

651
00:40:34,213 --> 00:40:38,213
Grandma, I don’t have a lot of time
to explain but we’re going to the store.

652
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,899
What’s at the store?

653
00:40:40,057 --> 00:40:41,081
Your memory.

654
00:40:44,258 --> 00:40:46,650
This is Spankenheimer’s, remember?

655
00:40:47,452 --> 00:40:48,701
Your elf costume?

656
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:52,480
You’d wear it to read to the kids
while their parents were shopping.

657
00:40:52,527 --> 00:40:54,164
I can’t believe it.

658
00:40:54,294 --> 00:40:55,373
You remember!

659
00:40:55,752 --> 00:40:58,410
No, that I would wear that shade of green
with my coloring.

660
00:40:58,508 --> 00:40:59,896
Easy for you to say.

661
00:41:00,718 --> 00:41:02,927
Tell me again why I’m baking two cakes?

662
00:41:03,014 --> 00:41:04,647
One’s with your recipe,

663
00:41:04,778 --> 00:41:08,563
the other uses the stuff in the vial
I found at cousin Mel’s cabin.

664
00:41:08,587 --> 00:41:10,977
And this is your famous homemade fruitcake

665
00:41:11,206 --> 00:41:13,826
that, uh, a lot of people liked.

666
00:41:24,932 --> 00:41:27,114
Jake, what am I doing here?

667
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,177
Grandma, you remember!

668
00:41:31,001 --> 00:41:31,993
Oh, yeah.

669
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:35,325
You lost your memory, but now it’s back.

670
00:41:36,886 --> 00:41:38,809
It felt like I was in a dream.

671
00:41:39,374 --> 00:41:42,927
And you were in it, and Santa Claus,
and Mrs. Claus.

672
00:41:43,738 --> 00:41:46,631
I thought I was in a …, only it was cold.

673
00:41:48,635 --> 00:41:50,836
But if everything you told me is true,

674
00:41:51,014 --> 00:41:53,307
why aren’t we at the courthouse
to prove that I’m okay?

675
00:41:54,334 --> 00:41:55,587
We’re on our way.

676
00:41:58,989 --> 00:42:00,871
Has the jury reached a verdict?

677
00:42:02,768 --> 00:42:04,385
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

678
00:42:04,582 --> 00:42:07,183
In the matter of the State v. Santa Claus

679
00:42:07,641 --> 00:42:09,605
we, the Jury, find…
– Stop!

680
00:42:10,004 --> 00:42:11,433
Santa is innocent.

681
00:42:11,472 --> 00:42:13,804
I’m grandma, and I’m not missing.

682
00:42:14,148 --> 00:42:15,306
I’m right here.

683
00:42:16,608 --> 00:42:20,027
That woman is a fraud.
Grandma doesn’t know who she is.

684
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:22,258
Honeybunches! Grandma!

685
00:42:24,413 --> 00:42:25,753
Order in the court!

686
00:42:26,228 --> 00:42:27,907
Since grandma isn’t missing

687
00:42:28,105 --> 00:42:32,056
I hereby rule that Santa Claus is innocent
of causing her disappearance.

688
00:42:37,286 --> 00:42:38,274
Your honor,

689
00:42:38,491 --> 00:42:41,569
there are still the charges of
sleighicular hit-and-run

690
00:42:41,574 --> 00:42:43,697
and leaving the scene of an accident.

691
00:42:45,436 --> 00:42:49,621
I can answer that, Your Honor. If you
and the Jury would taste this fruitcake.

692
00:42:51,062 --> 00:42:52,296
No, don’t!

693
00:42:52,714 --> 00:42:53,920
She objects.

694
00:42:53,943 --> 00:42:55,754
Overruled. Continue.

695
00:42:56,461 --> 00:42:59,988
This one was made by grandma
using her special ingredients.

696
00:43:00,347 --> 00:43:03,950
Taste it and then compare it
to the pieces of cake

697
00:43:03,954 --> 00:43:06,291
found at the scene of the alleged crime –

698
00:43:06,433 --> 00:43:08,346
state’s evidence #12.

699
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:12,504
Do we have to, Your Honor?

700
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:13,966
Good question.

701
00:43:14,587 --> 00:43:15,706
Do we have to?

702
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:18,947
Yes, I think you’ll find a difference
between the two.

703
00:43:19,433 --> 00:43:23,460
All right, in the name of justice,
we eat fruitcake.

704
00:43:30,337 --> 00:43:34,791
Now taste state’s evidence #12
found where grandma disappeared.

705
00:43:41,862 --> 00:43:43,285
So, what’s your point?

706
00:43:43,783 --> 00:43:46,748
These pieces had an extra ingredient in them

707
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:50,572
from this vial of bad stuff found
at cousin Mel’s cabin.

708
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:02,752
You see, Your Honor,
it had the effect of reindeer nip.

709
00:44:03,479 --> 00:44:05,996
That’s why the reindeer knocked over
grandma.

710
00:44:06,071 --> 00:44:08,103
It wasn’t Santa’s reckless driving.

711
00:44:09,184 --> 00:44:11,468
I, uh, couldn’t control myself.

712
00:44:12,429 --> 00:44:14,603
The boy has done it again.

713
00:44:15,133 --> 00:44:18,909
I rule that Santa is also innocent
of the hit-and-run charge.

714
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:23,434
And I suppose Jake has an answer to the
charge of leaving the scene of an accident –

715
00:44:23,533 --> 00:44:25,517
sleighicular negligence?

716
00:44:25,644 --> 00:44:26,667
Doofus does.

717
00:44:26,786 --> 00:44:27,826
He’s my dog.

718
00:44:27,984 --> 00:44:29,628
What? I object.

719
00:44:30,845 --> 00:44:31,960
Let’s have it.

720
00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:44,676
This is a note Santa left at the
accident scene explaining everything.

721
00:44:45,024 --> 00:44:46,833
Dust it for fingerprints.

722
00:44:53,339 --> 00:44:55,189
All right, I admit it.

723
00:44:55,667 --> 00:44:57,450
Yes, yes, I did it.

724
00:44:57,731 --> 00:44:58,794
I hid the note.

725
00:44:59,347 --> 00:45:00,240
And…?

726
00:45:01,215 --> 00:45:04,169
And I made grandpa sign over his rights
to the store.

727
00:45:04,677 --> 00:45:05,511
And…?

728
00:45:05,732 --> 00:45:07,689
I’m behind this evil trial.

729
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:08,531
And…?

730
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:11,914
And I hate the goody, goody feelings
of Christmas –

731
00:45:12,203 --> 00:45:14,070
all this caring and sharing.

732
00:45:14,098 --> 00:45:17,268
So I kidnapped grandma and made
Santa Claus the fall guy

733
00:45:17,272 --> 00:45:19,047
so I could get all his money.

734
00:45:19,385 --> 00:45:20,061
Hey,

735
00:45:20,536 --> 00:45:21,907
I deserve to be rich.

736
00:45:21,923 --> 00:45:26,188
Arrest this woman for obstructing justice
and almost ruining Christmas.

737
00:45:26,648 --> 00:45:29,138
That’s what you get for being selfish and stupid.

738
00:45:30,083 --> 00:45:32,110
Babe, you’ll look great in stripes.

739
00:45:32,541 --> 00:45:36,213
Santa Claus, you are hereby found
innocent of all charges.

740
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:37,883
You are free to go.

741
00:45:41,256 --> 00:45:42,272
Oh, yeah!

742
00:45:42,897 --> 00:45:44,806
May I say one thing, Your Honor?

743
00:45:44,885 --> 00:45:45,902
Of course.

744
00:45:45,921 --> 00:45:48,724
Jake, you saved Christmas.

745
00:46:03,489 --> 00:46:05,943
Grandma, I want to talk to you
about your store.

746
00:46:06,909 --> 00:46:10,067
Young man, after everything
Jake has gone through

747
00:46:10,379 --> 00:46:12,571
do you really think I’m gonna sell?

748
00:46:12,753 --> 00:46:15,392
I don’t want to buy it.
I want to franchise it –

749
00:46:15,496 --> 00:46:18,801
open Spankenheimer general stores
all over the country.

750
00:46:19,077 --> 00:46:21,014
And I want you to be in charge.

751
00:46:21,465 --> 00:46:22,445
You did it.

752
00:46:23,026 --> 00:46:25,042
You’re a pretty cool little bro.

753
00:46:25,303 --> 00:46:27,311
We’re so proud of you, Jake.

754
00:46:27,457 --> 00:46:30,303
You never gave up
even when the rest of us did.

755
00:46:30,813 --> 00:46:31,710
So, Jake,

756
00:46:32,342 --> 00:46:34,066
what do you want for Christmas?

757
00:46:34,453 --> 00:46:35,327
Nothin’.

758
00:46:35,623 --> 00:46:38,671
I already got the best Christmas gift ever.

759
00:46:39,449 --> 00:46:41,738
I feel the same way.

760
00:46:42,172 --> 00:46:43,995
I’m glad you’re back, grandma.

761
00:46:44,975 --> 00:46:48,319
On, Donner, on, Blitzen…

762
00:46:48,868 --> 00:46:50,078
The rest of you!

763
00:46:53,003 --> 00:46:54,457
Just the way it happened.

764
00:46:54,991 --> 00:46:56,390
Oh, wait.

765
00:46:57,121 --> 00:46:59,275
I left out one more thing.

766
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,391
Not that one!

767
00:47:02,573 --> 00:47:03,873
It’s cousin Mel’s!

768
00:47:03,975 --> 00:47:05,038
Wha-ha!

769
00:47:08,717 --> 00:47:09,527
Oh, no!

770
00:47:09,937 --> 00:47:11,008
Reindeer nip.

771
00:47:11,522 --> 00:47:13,036
Not again!

772
00:47:13,154 --> 00:47:16,417
Grandma got run over by a reindeer

773
00:47:17,521 --> 00:47:20,577
walking home from our house
Christmas Eve.

774
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:24,946
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,

775
00:47:26,087 --> 00:47:29,318
but as for me and Grandpa, we believe.

776
00:47:31,338 --> 00:47:33,879
She'd been drinkin' too much eggnog,

777
00:47:35,692 --> 00:47:37,889
and we'd begged her not to go.

778
00:47:39,801 --> 00:47:42,552
But she forgot her medication,

779
00:47:43,433 --> 00:47:46,705
and she staggered out the door
into the snow.

780
00:47:48,807 --> 00:47:51,450
When we found her Christmas morning

781
00:47:53,356 --> 00:47:55,340
at the scene of the attack

782
00:47:57,622 --> 00:48:00,322
she had hoof prints on her forehead

783
00:48:01,041 --> 00:48:04,120
and incriminating Claus marks on her back.

784
00:48:05,994 --> 00:48:09,108
Grandma got run over by a reindeer

785
00:48:10,361 --> 00:48:13,468
walking home from our house
Christmas Eve.

786
00:48:14,757 --> 00:48:17,900
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,

787
00:48:18,919 --> 00:48:22,176
but as for me and Grandpa, we believe.

788
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:27,197
Now we're all so proud of grandpa –

789
00:48:28,553 --> 00:48:30,739
he's been taking this so well –,

790
00:48:32,967 --> 00:48:35,560
see him in there watching football,

791
00:48:36,256 --> 00:48:39,640
drinking beer and playing cards
with cousin Mel.

792
00:48:41,692 --> 00:48:44,510
It's not Christmas without grandma,

793
00:48:46,204 --> 00:48:48,346
all the family's dressed in black.

794
00:48:50,556 --> 00:48:53,272
And we just can't help but wonder

795
00:48:53,888 --> 00:48:57,062
should we open up her gifts
or send them back?

796
00:48:57,207 --> 00:48:58,361
Send them back!

797
00:48:58,851 --> 00:49:02,009
Grandma got run over by a reindeer

798
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:06,376
walking home from our house
Christmas Eve.

799
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:10,657
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,

800
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,932
but as for me and grandpa, we believe.

801
00:49:17,025 --> 00:49:19,733
Now the goose is on the table,

802
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:24,158
and the pudding made of fig,

803
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:28,701
and the blue and silver candles

804
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:32,629
that would just have matched
the hair in grandma's wig.

805
00:49:34,608 --> 00:49:37,377
I've warned all my friends and neighbors –

806
00:49:39,033 --> 00:49:41,778
better watch out for yourselves.

807
00:49:43,427 --> 00:49:46,158
They should never give a license

808
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:50,486
to a man who drives a sleigh
and plays with elves.

809
00:49:51,696 --> 00:49:54,959
Grandma got run over by a reindeer

810
00:49:56,102 --> 00:49:59,117
walking home from our house
Christmas Eve.

811
00:50:00,476 --> 00:50:03,516
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,

812
00:50:04,655 --> 00:50:07,892
but as for me and Grandpa, we believe.

813
00:50:08,211 --> 00:50:09,630
Sing it, grandpa…
