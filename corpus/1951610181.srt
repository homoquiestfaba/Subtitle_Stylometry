1
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:25,049
BOY: I'll give you that third birthmark
right on your ass.

2
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,114
Let's go!

3
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,353
( children chattering )

4
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:33,230
BOY: I'll take that hockey mask
and shove it right up your butt.

5
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:52,340
You see him?

6
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,546
No.

7
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,753
Come on, Jacob.
It's cool.

8
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:00,656
Ow!

9
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,362
- ( boys laugh )
- BOY: Oh, you got him.

10
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:08,399
( laughter )

11
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,097
Come on, come on.

12
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:20,704
- JACOB: What the hell is that?
- RUDY: Piss.

13
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:24,412
Hurry up. Go!

14
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,586
Oh, shit!

15
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:31,523
BOY: It's piss!

16
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,218
( gagging )

17
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,956
You and your ugly-ass brother
are so dead.

18
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,827
Anytime you're ready, dickhead.

19
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:40,559
Stop throwing up!

20
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,100
You're dead!

21
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,640
I'm past the deadline
on my thesis, Lee.

22
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,304
I don't have time to debate you.
She's your daughter.

23
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,473
Ma!
I need help.

24
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:30,709
You know what, Lee?

25
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:35,186
Any parent would be parent of the year
next to you, selfish prick.

26
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,116
Yeah, well...

27
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:50,366
You're late.

28
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:54,431
Yeah, well,
I began menstruating this morning,

29
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,566
and I had some difficulty
inserting the tampon.

30
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,835
What? It's a natural process.

31
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:04,475
You know I could conceive
and carry and birth a child right now?

32
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:06,884
Big deal. You won't.

33
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:08,981
But I could.

34
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,794
JACOB: Do you think I should
have Mom look at it?

35
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,299
Our birthday comes once a year,
and you ask for a hockey mask.

36
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,390
You don't even play.

37
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:25,301
Jason from <i>Friday the 13th</i> wears one.
He's bad-ass.

38
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:30,565
I dropped piss on Kenny's head.

39
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:31,905
What?

40
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,036
Jeff and Kenny were here.

41
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:35,876
I dropped the piss I've been saving
on their heads.

42
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,247
Why were you saving piss?

43
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,115
Just in case.
Pretty smart, huh?

44
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,380
JACOB: No. It's stupid.

45
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:44,252
'Cause now they're gonna come back here
and kick all of our asses.

46
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,689
You're such a butt munch!

47
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:49,923
MALEE: You guys!

48
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,258
It's your birthday!

49
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,628
Try to get along.

50
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,933
Malee. Take this up, please.

51
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,296
BOTH: Cheese.

52
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:07,845
Okay, you got
your small gifts this morning.

53
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,279
Now for the big ones.

54
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,483
Oh, my God!

55
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,079
Yes! This is too cool.

56
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:20,091
- Do you like it, Jacob?
- JACOB: Thanks.

57
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,057
( pop music playing )

58
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,396
WOMAN: ? Copper head
on a sunny pillow ?

59
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:34,167
? Brown eyes open,
go straight to the window ?

60
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,538
? As she opens her mind ?

61
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,407
? Another dream tonight ?

62
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:44,648
? Snow falls hard on a... ?

63
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,546
- It's ten acres.
-I'm not selling that land.

64
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,680
I'm willing to pay top dollar.

65
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:54,487
All right, you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna write down a number.

66
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,721
Look, our kids play in those woods
all the time.

67
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,388
You can't put a price on that.

68
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,931
I believe I can.

69
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:09,898
? You ?

70
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:14,003
? Are my everything... ?

71
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,642
KENNY: Go, man! Come on!

72
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,156
They're gonna
tear down the tree house tonight.

73
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:26,623
We gotta stop them.

74
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,854
JACOB: So? It's just a tree house.

75
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:30,920
You suck.

76
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:31,986
Leonard, you in?

77
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,533
You don't have to go
if you don't want to.

78
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:36,795
I'll go.

79
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,572
Let him go.

80
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,710
( fireworks popping and whistling )

81
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,167
Rudy?

82
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,872
RUDY: Unless you're coming with me,
I don't wanna hear about it.

83
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:27,049
Jeff and Kenny pick on you all the time,
and you don't do shit.

84
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,417
JACOB: It's <i>my</i> problem.

85
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:31,218
No, it's my problem, too,
because we're brothers.

86
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,723
That's what brothers do.

87
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,917
JACOB: I don't feel that way.

88
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,130
'Cause you're a pussy.

89
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:04,484
Rudy?

90
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,764
What?

91
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,176
Maybe we shouldn't talk.

92
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:27,836
Just listen for 'em.

93
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,946
And don't you fall asleep.

94
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,541
I'm wide awake.

95
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,018
KENNY: Can you stop walking?

96
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,394
Wait up.
I've gotta get my lighter out.

97
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,863
JEFF: All right, hurry up, man.

98
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:49,657
Come here.

99
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,666
We're gonna burn it down.
Here, come here.

100
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,000
Hell yeah, man.

101
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:55,700
Let's go.

102
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,301
- JEFF: Light mine, too.
- It's lit!

103
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:00,743
Move. You go first, you go first.

104
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,802
All right.

105
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,549
( Rudy moans )

106
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,810
Go.

107
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,150
- You suck.
- Got it.

108
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,251
RUDY: What?

109
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,454
- You hear that?
- RUDY: Put it out!

110
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,053
Aw, shit, man!
They're in there!

111
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,064
- KENNY: Where are you going?!
- Go! Run!

112
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:21,258
KENNY: Get back here!

113
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,097
( Rudy screaming )

114
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,899
RUDY: Leonard! Aah!

115
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,667
( Rudy screaming )

116
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,043
Come on, wake up!

117
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,411
Come on!

118
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,366
Come on, you better get--Shit!

119
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:01,865
Oh, my God.

120
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:29,592
( voice distorted )

121
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,740
( people whispering )

122
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:00,727
<i>'Cause you're a pussy.</i>

123
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,762
WOMAN: ( crying ) My baby!

124
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:06,429
Oh, my God!

125
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,340
Oh, my--my baby!

126
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:20,148
MAN: Jim, I, uh...I've gotta leave.

127
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,846
Again, I'm just...

128
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,379
I'm so, so sorry.

129
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,183
( woman sobbing )

130
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,030
You still interested in buying that land?

131
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,928
We can talk about it later if you'd like.

132
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,494
Build houses, condos, 7-Eleven,
I don't care.

133
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:42,302
I just don't wanna recognize it
ever again.

134
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:46,266
Okay.

135
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,751
This hospital is a nightmare.

136
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:01,289
- WOMAN: How are you feeling?
- My head hurts.

137
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,921
You're lucky you didn't get killed.

138
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,464
I told you I'm sorry.

139
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,023
WOMAN: I've never been
so scared in my life.

140
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,137
And...poor Rudy.

141
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,028
( sniffs )

142
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,862
( sighs )

143
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,313
Was it a friend or family?

144
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:57,407
Huh?

145
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,884
The person who died.

146
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,081
Friend.

147
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,083
I'm sorry.

148
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,128
Well, you're--
you're gonna like Dr. Chung.

149
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,058
MAN: This is only my second session.

150
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,498
She's really good.

151
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,596
I'm not a patient.
I'm her daughter.

152
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,901
Oh, yeah!

153
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,443
I can see the resemblance.

154
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,706
You trying to make me sick?

155
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,676
MAN: Miss Farland,
you can come in now.

156
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:37,782
Mr. Maitland?

157
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,889
DR. CHUNG:
I--I'll be just a second.

158
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,137
You're upset...

159
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,468
...and that's good.

160
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,381
And it's okay to cry, you know?

161
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,438
Ma.

162
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,678
I know it's okay to cry, okay?

163
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:09,220
I don't need you to tell me
it's okay to cry.

164
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,212
lf I wanna cry, I'll cry.

165
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:15,250
Fine.

166
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:23,930
( whimpers )

167
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,994
( machines beeping )

168
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,740
NURSE: You've gotta eat something.

169
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,777
MAN: Leonard has a condition.

170
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,903
It's called anosmia.

171
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,539
Oh, my God.
Is it serious?

172
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:40,142
No. Anosmia is when a person
loses their sense of smell.

173
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,620
It's not uncommon in patients
who suffer severe head injuries.

174
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:47,181
Unfortunately, it's also affecting
his ability to taste.

175
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,988
Again, not uncommon.

176
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,791
- I-is it permanent?
- That depends upon the patient.

177
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,996
What--what do we do?

178
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,503
He can't eat.

179
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:03,565
Oh, he <i>car</i> eat.
He just can't taste what he's eating.

180
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:06,373
I--I can't believe this is happening.

181
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:09,937
Considering what Leonard
could have suffered, he's lucky.

182
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,540
And he is severely overweight.

183
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:16,054
Perhaps a loss of appetite
will be a benefit.

184
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:21,422
It feels gross, this film on my tongue.

185
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:22,988
Hey.

186
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,028
I don't like apples.

187
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,070
So, you can't taste it, right?

188
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:33,695
Maybe you'll like the crunch.

189
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,091
( chainsaw buzzing )

190
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:23,216
( buzzing continues )

191
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,323
Oh, my God.

192
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,061
That guy...

193
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,567
I--I, like, know him.

194
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,906
He--he's one of my mom's patients.

195
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,067
So?

196
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,343
Should we go over and say hi?

197
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,786
I just wanna get out of here.

198
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,816
You coming, Malee?

199
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,264
WOMAN: Tommy Camacho.

200
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,300
Jacob Carges.

201
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,240
Rudy Carges.

202
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,249
Rudy Carges.

203
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,788
He's not in class anymore.

204
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,121
Now, how do you know?

205
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,450
'Cause he's dead.

206
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,859
WOMAN: It is not funny
to joke like that

207
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:42,458
about a fellow classmate's death,
Mr. Carges.

208
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,899
- Are you...
- His brother.

209
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:48,236
Was.

210
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:51,341
And I'm not kidding.
He's dead.

211
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,637
I'm so sorry.

212
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,707
Eight.

213
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:02,314
Ooh!

214
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:08,622
The state's requirement
for upper body strength is ten chin-ups.

215
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,286
Leonard, you're up.

216
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,231
( boy giggles )

217
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:27,602
Come on, son.

218
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,548
Come on, son!
Fight it.

219
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:33,342
( Leonard farts )

220
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,852
( students laughing )

221
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,615
Hey. That's enough.

222
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:38,885
All right, good job.

223
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,023
COACH: Who hasn't gone?

224
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,423
( boy chuckles )

225
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:47,488
( all playing out of tune )

226
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,735
( music stops )

227
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,533
Did anyone practice
over the summer?

228
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:06,107
Great. Well, we still have
a fall recital coming up.

229
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:10,019
lf anyone would like to perform a solo,
the sign-up sheet is on the door.

230
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,454
Class dismissed.

231
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,311
COACH: Not you, Leonard.

232
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:45,080
Center. That's the position
you'll be playing in two years.

233
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,488
Football?

234
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,254
- You don't like football?
- I love it.

235
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:52,161
It's just...
I'll never make the weight requirement.

236
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,927
Oh, there's no weight requirement
in high school, son.

237
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,199
These are your new bibles.

238
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:04,538
One on nutrition, the other exercise.

239
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,441
Now, you do what they say,

240
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:09,345
and you can play for me
once you come to high school.

241
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,477
Thanks.

242
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,988
Coach, why are you doing this for me?

243
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:26,321
Because I've never met a child
so out of shape in my life.

244
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,100
WOMAN: <i>I'm being stupid?</i>

245
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,969
No, they are wrong.
You call them back.

246
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,307
MAN: Ashley, I talked to the lawyer.
He wouldn't lie.

247
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,471
What's going on?

248
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:42,605
You know what?
This is all your fault.

249
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,670
- Me?
- Yes.

250
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:44,841
Because if you'd done what I said
and gone to the trial,

251
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:45,906
this never would have happened!

252
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:48,782
We both agreed it would be too painful!
We both agreed!

253
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,048
<i>You</i> agreed!

254
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,952
- Mom, what happened?
- ASHLEY: Tell him.

255
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,118
Tell your son.

256
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,628
The boys who killed Rudy
cut a deal.

257
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:08,696
They got a year in juvenile hall
and five years' probation.

258
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:11,834
One year.
That's what his life is wroth.

259
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,138
- Ashley.
- One year.

260
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,237
- Just calm down.
- How can you be so unaffected by this?

261
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,248
Your son was murdered!

262
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,648
It was an accident.

263
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:24,819
It was an accident.
And those boys were juveniles.

264
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,448
So that makes it okay?

265
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:34,962
( door slams )

266
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,572
( wind chime sounding )

267
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:04,587
<i>You're dead!</i>

268
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:07,325
( thunder crashing )

269
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:10,368
- JIM: <i>You don’t believe me.</i>
- ASHLEY: <i>No. they're wrong!</i>

270
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,766
JIM: <i>It was an accident.</i>

271
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:14,738
ASHLEY: <i>Ore.</i>
<i>That's what his life is worth. Ore year.</i>

272
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,740
- JIM: <i>Ashley. just--</i>
- ASHLEY: <i>Your son was murdered!</i>

273
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,842
I can't believe how much you suck.

274
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,480
I want them dead.

275
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,659
I wanna kill them.
I could handle a year in prison.

276
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,931
Don't you miss him?

277
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,193
You don't even care!

278
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:48,069
It's not that we don't care.

279
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,266
It's just--

280
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,706
Life goes on.

281
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,570
It does.

282
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,609
You have to deal with it.

283
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:59,583
You know 90% of people's problems are
due to their inability to get over the past?

284
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,618
How do you know?

285
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,949
Mom tells that to all her patients.

286
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:06,252
I've eavesdropped
on some of her therapy sessions.

287
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,226
That's cool.
Can I listen in sometime?

288
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:10,488
No.

289
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:15,531
Anyway, she says
if a person wants closure,

290
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,864
they gotta deal
with their problems head-on.

291
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:20,871
Go see these guys
and tell them how you feel.

292
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,305
Juvy hall's only
like 40 minutes from here.

293
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:25,706
Take a taxi.

294
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:31,841
WOMAN: ? You can't change
without someone's shadow ?

295
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:43,223
? 'Cause then it's gone
when you still shine ?

296
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:54,400
? You can't change
to solve somebody's name... ?

297
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:41,185
I hate you!
You know that?!

298
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,743
Hmm?

299
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,482
All this happened 'cause of <i>you.</i>

300
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,492
You deformed retard!

301
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,129
Every night I lie in bed
and plan your murder.

302
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,299
I'm shaking.

303
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,975
I'm gonna take a kitchen knife
and chop off your fingers.

304
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,636
Then your nose,
and then your tongue.

305
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,308
Then I'm gonna take scissors
and cut off your ears.

306
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:16,082
When they find you, it'll be like
putting a jigsaw puzzle back together.

307
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:21,588
You kill me, you come here.

308
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,128
So? What do I have to look forward to?

309
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:26,664
You destroyed my life!

310
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,892
What happened was an accident!

311
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:31,693
There are no accidents.

312
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:34,798
You're gonna pay for what you did.

313
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:36,966
And it's gonna hurt like hell.

314
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:54,149
MALEE: Don't I know you?

315
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,085
You're Dr. Chung's daughter.

316
00:24:58,196 --> 00:24:59,891
Yeah. You remember. Um...

317
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,528
We were never introduced.
My name's Malee.

318
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:04,762
Oh, hey.

319
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,599
Hi.

320
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:07,933
Gus. Hi.

321
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:11,540
What are you doing here?

322
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,278
I--I was in the mood for a picnic, um...

323
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:19,780
And I thought this would be
a nice place to have one.

324
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,216
MAN: Move that fucking truck!

325
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:23,345
- GUS: Right.
- Um...

326
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:27,357
Would you like to join me?
'Cause there's plenty of food.

327
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,925
Uh, you know what, I don't go for lunch
for another ten minutes, so...

328
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,022
I'll wait.

329
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:40,504
Meet me by that cement mixer
when--when you're ready.

330
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:49,275
So last time I saw you,
you were just getting back from a funeral.

331
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:50,939
How are you doing?

332
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:53,376
Okay.

333
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,948
Death is, like, so weird, you know?

334
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:02,516
I mean, it's sad...

335
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,893
...but I also feel
like I've been given this sign.

336
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:12,300
A sign which is telling me life is short,
so you gotta do what makes you happy.

337
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,066
You gotta take chances and...

338
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,471
get crazy!
( chuckles )

339
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,808
And what are you doing to get crazy?

340
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,402
I--I play the flute.

341
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,142
( chuckling )

342
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:28,777
Well, you know,
that's--that's totally nuts.

343
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:31,083
The flute. ( laughs )

344
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,316
No, not like that.

345
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:36,520
Just, you know, like every year
my school has this recital.

346
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:39,487
Um, and, you know, every year,

347
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:45,628
I've been, like, too chicken to play a solo
in front of people.

348
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:49,834
Um, but I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it this year.

349
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:54,238
You know what, good for you.

350
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:56,943
That's great.
Good for you.

351
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:58,972
When is it?

352
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:02,976
Why do you care?

353
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,248
Oh, 'cause I'm gonna come.

354
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:05,880
What?

355
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,754
- Yeah.
- You can't go!

356
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:08,952
Sure I can.

357
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:10,961
Nobody goes to these things.

358
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,263
I don't even think my mom's coming.

359
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:16,164
Well, you're gonna need somebody
to root for you, right?

360
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:17,758
And besides, I love music.

361
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:23,172
And, you know, I owe you
for this terrific lunch, right?

362
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,269
Are we having company?

363
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:31,645
It is all for you.

364
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:33,650
Your favorites.

365
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:40,351
Oh, and I made everything extra spicy
so you can taste it.

366
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,620
Mom, it doesn't matter
how spicy the food is.

367
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,422
So you're not gonna even try it?

368
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,466
I'm sure it's delicious.

369
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:51,429
Forget it.

370
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:54,336
Don't eat.

371
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,306
You can't just eat apples all the time.

372
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:01,034
Why not?

373
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,739
It's unhealthy.

MAN: ? We've gathered the corn
and ground it flat ?

376
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:36,671
? Wrestled the meat
and trimmed the fat ?

377
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:42,910
? I think it was wheat, and we deserve
ten times better than that ?

<i>I hear. I...</i>

379
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,535
I haven't fought fires
in over three years.

380
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:03,437
Something stirred your unconscious.

381
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:07,103
lf we can figure out what that was,
we can get some answers.

382
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:09,936
Okay.

383
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:11,982
All right!

384
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:14,776
Let's do it!

385
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:19,483
You said that your nightmares started
around the time that you moved here.

386
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:20,546
Yeah.

387
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:21,956
Let's explore that.

388
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:23,653
Why did you move here?

389
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:26,891
A friend of mine was
working construction.

390
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:31,800
He got a job offer
over at the--the Lindsay Acres job,

391
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:36,603
and, uh, I thought it'd be a good idea
to come work with him for a little while.

392
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:41,737
Are there any recurring elements
to your dreams?

393
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,713
Faces?

394
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:50,320

396
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,523
Yeah, you know,
the Blue Oyster Cult song?

397
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,502
- Dad?
- Jacob.

398
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,166
Y-you okay?

399
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,175
Fantastic.

400
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:16,474
You know...

401
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:21,943
For the past few weeks,
I sat in this house...

402
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:24,482
I couldn't move.

403
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,118
Everything reminded me of Rudy.

404
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,927
And then from out of nowhere...

405
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,520
...I had a revelation.

406
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,198
I'm alive.

407
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:38,258
Your mother is alive.

408
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,201
And I became overcome...

409
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:46,901
...with joy, because I realized
how lucky we are to still have you.

410
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:50,906
Me?

411
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,176
Jacob.

412
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,352
I love you.

413
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:10,693
I went to work today
for the first time in weeks.

414
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:11,962
I was fearless.

415
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,436
It was as if I'd just gotten out of college.

416
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,996
I went after accounts
I'd avoided for <i>years</i>

417
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:19,509
because I thought
they were out of my league.

418
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:21,837
And I was amazing.

419
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:24,040
I was magic!

420
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:25,980
But then when I came home
to share the news with your mother,

421
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,314
I found her asleep,
and then when I looked at the house,

422
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,355
I realized that <i>her</i> office,
for lack of a better word,

423
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:34,323
was also piled up,
so I took to the house.

424
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,919
I have made it my duty to clean this place
from top to bottom,

425
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:40,123
even if it takes me all freakin' night.

426
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:42,455
Jacob.

427
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:46,369
- Yeah?
- Will you join me?

428
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:50,134
Join me in this symbolic gesture
of cleaning out the old

429
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,073
and bringing in the new.

430
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:55,243
Do I have to?

431
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,574
No.

Thank you, Mr. Farmer.

Um, there's actually been a change.

442
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,406
I'm not gonna play the theme
from <i>Love Story.</i>

443
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,082
Um, this is a s--s--

444
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,879
- ( Mr. Farmer mutters )
- What?

445
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:09,716
I can't hear you!

446
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:16,724
Anyway, um, this is a song
from the Blue Oyster Cult.

? I can't see no reason
to put up a fight ?

you told me I suck than lie.

- It's a good song.
- Yeah.

What made you choose that?

481
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:20,714
My mother. She was humming it
all last week, you know,

482
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,720
'cause she's a big B.O.C. fan.

483
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,350
- Right.
- Yeah.

484
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:29,552
- Was she here?
- No. No, she's got class.

- Yeah.

Well, she missed out.

You're so sweet.

Malee, I, uh--
I had a really good time.

489
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:46,641
- I--I gotta run, but, uh...
- Okay.

490
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:49,612
But thank you.
Really, thanks.

It's crap.

504

I'm gonna ask you this once,
and I want a straight answer.

505
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,009
Are you in a cult?

MAN: ( chuckling ) Grace.

This is exactly what happens
when kids join cults.

508
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,118
The first thing they change
is their diets.

509
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:03,585
I'm not in a cult.

510
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:07,485
The issue is that you have stolen

511
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,823
one of the most exciting nights of the year
from your sisters.

512
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,021
lf anybody had done this to you
when you were a kid,

we never would've heard the end of it.

514

- Exactly.
- Now, get upstairs.

515
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,532
Now!

516
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,296
I wish somebody had done it to me.

517
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,868

00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,814
How could we forget?

00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:17,224
You've been coming here for months
to remind us.

525

No one's forcing you to talk to me.

Anything to get out of my cell.

527
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:25,963
Is your cell small?

528

Yes.

531

554

Rudy. His name was Rudy.

555
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:56,384
Oh, you knew him?

556
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:00,260
Yeah. Um, he's one of my best friends.

- Different?

714

you know?

719

720

somebody older than you,

721

724
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:53,986
Well, I don't--you know, problems.

725
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:58,084
You know, I think when a couple
has an age difference,

726
00:54:58,161 --> 00:55:01,824
they, um--they end up splitting up
because they want different things.

727
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:03,092

728
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:06,895
Uh, no. No.

729
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,460
No.

730
00:55:10,707 --> 00:55:14,040
Well, yeah, yeah.
Let's say, you know, you're 1 2, right?

731
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:18,242
And a boy
just a few years older than ya,

732
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,306
well, you know,
he'll be more experienced,

733
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:24,752
and boys--they can be impatient
about that sort of thing.

734
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,381
- Are you impatient?
- No.

735
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:29,755

736
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,316

You still wanted different things.

745

I don't think it's about age.

746
00:55:57,087 --> 00:56:00,523

747
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:02,182
they connect for other reasons.

748
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,892

749

Leonard, wake up.

886
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:49,455
Leonard.

887
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:01,402
No!

888
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:04,073
Please!

889
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:06,371
Aah!

890
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:07,347
<i>Please!</i>

891
01:08:10,653 --> 01:08:12,780
( door opens )

892
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,291
What the hell is this?

893
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:24,757
I made dinner, my love.

894
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,028
Right.

895
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:29,969
( whispers ) And I have a surprise.

896
01:08:30,906 --> 01:08:32,874
You've been in here before,
haven't you?

897
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:36,636
Oh, Malee.

898
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:40,807
Malee, you gotta--
you gotta put on your clothes.

899
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:47,080
Don't you like my body?

900
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:52,623
<i>Now</i>. Malee.

901
01:08:54,663 --> 01:08:55,891
It's okay.

902
01:08:58,067 --> 01:08:59,227
I love you.

903
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:04,764
Malee. Stop.

904
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:17,583
? Pretty thing, I've got you ?

905
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:19,052
Touch me.

906
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:27,588
? Right where I used to be ?

907
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:39,073
? We ride across this city ?

908
01:09:42,144 --> 01:09:45,272
? Starting fires recklessly... ?

909
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:46,871
Where are you going?

910
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:49,851
To call your mother.

911
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:57,558
But we're soul mates.

912
01:10:22,851 --> 01:10:26,719
I--I don't even...know what to say.

913
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:38,232
( car engine starts )

914
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,942
It's alive.

915
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:01,481
- What happened?
- Gas leak.

916
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:03,525
- My mom, is she--
- She'll be fine.

917
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:05,150
She broke her hip and a few ribs.

918
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:07,855
We're trying to get your father
on the phone right now.

919
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:10,899
- I have to see her.
- Shh.

920
01:11:11,634 --> 01:11:13,158
You need your rest.

921
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:15,897
Everything is fine now.

922
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:28,848
( clears throat )

923
01:11:37,893 --> 01:11:38,985
Uh, you know, it's--

924
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:40,494
Before we begin, I want to apologize--

925
01:11:40,562 --> 01:11:42,052
You know what? It's my fault.

926
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:45,133
Uh, I knew she had a crush on me.

927
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:49,634
I--I just felt bad for her, you know?

928
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:54,142
She's a very lonely girl.

929
01:11:57,413 --> 01:12:01,679
lf it's any consolation, uh...
( chuckles )

930
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:04,150
the whole thing
was kinda therapeutic for me.

931
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:09,583
Right. ( chuckles )

932
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:10,647
Sorry.

933
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:12,318
I, uh...

934
01:12:12,394 --> 01:12:13,793
It's okay.

935
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:17,496
It's <i>your</i> therapy, not mine.

936
01:12:21,603 --> 01:12:24,163
Well, so, how was it therapeutic?

937
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:30,035
I don't remember the last time
I slept so deep and so sound.

938
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:32,380
Don't remember dreaming.

939
01:12:32,448 --> 01:12:33,745
Nothing.

940
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:36,015
Why do you think that is?

941
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:44,184
One of the last fires I ever fought...

942
01:12:44,259 --> 01:12:45,851
was a brownstone.

943
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:48,392
Whole families wiped out.

944
01:12:50,499 --> 01:12:54,196
During the inspection,
I went upstairs.

945
01:12:56,271 --> 01:12:57,761
And I found a little girl.

946
01:13:00,175 --> 01:13:02,871
The whole right side of her face
was burned off.

947
01:13:06,281 --> 01:13:07,748
But her eyes were open.

948
01:13:10,853 --> 01:13:12,616
She was still alive.

949
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:19,020
Uh...

950
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:27,058
You know that the--the pain
must've been...

951
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:30,134
...excruciating.

952
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,434
You know?

953
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:48,580
She was--she was begging for me
to--to kill her.

954
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:54,559
And what did you do?

955
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:02,232
I did what she wanted me to do.

956
01:14:09,178 --> 01:14:10,167
I killed her.

957
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:21,682
I kept telling myself
that that was the right thing to do.

958
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,115
You know, it's--just--

959
01:14:30,999 --> 01:14:32,159
But, uh...

960
01:14:33,268 --> 01:14:35,293
I've never been so sure.

961
01:14:38,907 --> 01:14:40,374
I'm sorry.

962
01:14:40,442 --> 01:14:42,774
Gus, that's devastating.

963
01:14:47,616 --> 01:14:50,642
What does all this have to do
with Malee?

964
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:55,882
When I saw her last night...

965
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:02,957
...she had the same look on her face
as that little girl.

966
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:07,267
She just wanted me
to take her pain away.

967
01:15:17,579 --> 01:15:18,568
Doctor?

968
01:15:25,821 --> 01:15:29,257
I heard it's supposed to rain,
so I packed a poncho.

969
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:36,726
You're acting weird, man.
You're not gonna be a chicken.

970
01:15:36,798 --> 01:15:37,890
No.

971
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:43,137
I'm telling you, man,
it's gonna be great.

972
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:48,074
You ain't gonna be a pussy, right?

973
01:15:48,143 --> 01:15:49,201
No.

974
01:16:06,428 --> 01:16:07,588
Wanna play some catch?

975
01:16:07,663 --> 01:16:09,130
Where the hell did you get that?!

976
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:13,024
Did I say you could touch this?
Did I?!

977
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:17,534
Okay, everything--and I mean everything--
in this house is mine.

978
01:16:17,606 --> 01:16:19,039
You got it?

979
01:16:19,107 --> 01:16:22,099
You are not allowed to touch a thing,
including this glove!

980
01:16:33,889 --> 01:16:35,186
What's wrong now?

981
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:40,551
I was just looking at a picture
of you and Rudy when you were born.

982
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:44,289
God, I miss him.

983
01:16:45,467 --> 01:16:46,832
But you have Keith now.

984
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:50,137
What the hell does that mean?

985
01:16:50,205 --> 01:16:51,433
You have Keith.

986
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:54,300
Two boys again.
Everything's fine.

987
01:16:54,376 --> 01:16:57,038
We didn't adopt Keith to replace Rudy.

988
01:16:57,112 --> 01:16:58,545
Didn't you?

989
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:01,242
No. Your father and I
discussed adoption for years.

990
01:17:01,316 --> 01:17:02,977
Honey, we--we told you that.

991
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:04,382
Right.

992
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:07,945
Maybe if it was me that died, you wouldn't
need another kid to get over it.

993
01:17:08,023 --> 01:17:09,752
What are you talking about?

994
01:17:09,825 --> 01:17:11,986
I wouldn't wish that
on any of my children.

995
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:13,925
But one of us died.

996
01:17:14,596 --> 01:17:18,555
And I bet if you could choose which one,
you wish it was me.

997
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:20,761
You know what? I...

998
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:24,730
I know that you feel we favored Rudy.

999
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:26,137
You did! Admit it.

1000
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:29,268
I admit that he was easier to raise,
but that doesn't we loved him more.

1001
01:17:29,344 --> 01:17:33,075
Honey, Jacob, you were born
with a different set of challenges.

1002
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:34,240
- My birthmark?
- Yes.

1003
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:35,943
And it's not easy being different.

1004
01:17:36,018 --> 01:17:37,610
I'm not different!

1005
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:40,478
You always made it seem
like there was something wrong!

1006
01:17:40,555 --> 01:17:41,920
There's nothing wrong with me!

1007
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:43,548
- I know that--
- No, you don't!

1008
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,460
It's like you don't know
what to do with me.

1009
01:17:48,063 --> 01:17:49,155
You never did.

1010
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:51,265
Well, I'm sorry that you feel that way.

1011
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:53,164
You know,
you do what you can as a parent

1012
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:55,533
and sometimes you don't
always make the right choices,

1013
01:17:55,604 --> 01:17:59,938
but you are my son and I love you,
and I would do anything for you.

1014
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:04,001
I would fight for you, I would kill for you,
I'd die for you!

1015
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:09,916
Rudy used to say the same thing.

1016
01:18:11,653 --> 01:18:13,052
And he was right.

1017
01:18:15,757 --> 01:18:18,453
And as un-Christian as it sounds,
I still want the...

1018
01:18:20,729 --> 01:18:22,822
...boy that killed Rudy dead.

1019
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:27,695
And someday, when you grow up,

1020
01:18:27,769 --> 01:18:29,703
you'll understand that.

1021
01:18:34,076 --> 01:18:35,202
Someday.

1022
01:19:13,849 --> 01:19:15,817
( thunder crashes )

1023
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:19,852
A week?

1024
01:19:21,156 --> 01:19:22,145
No--

1025
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:25,618
Dad. Dad, I can take a train alone.

1026
01:19:28,530 --> 01:19:29,792
I understand.

1027
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:31,659
You, too.

1028
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:34,833
( sighs )

1029
01:19:39,407 --> 01:19:41,102
He really hates me.

1030
01:19:41,843 --> 01:19:43,435
He doesn't hate you.

1031
01:19:45,914 --> 01:19:47,313
I'm just gonna go see him.

1032
01:19:47,382 --> 01:19:49,646
That is not a good idea.

1033
01:19:51,686 --> 01:19:54,883
He doesn't wanna see me. Fine.

1034
01:19:54,956 --> 01:19:57,891
I just want him to
look me in the eyes and say it.

1035
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:04,928
- I can handle it, Ma.
- You don't know him.

1036
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,627
That's the problem.

1037
01:20:08,336 --> 01:20:10,930
Aren't you sick of being
angry at him all the time?

1038
01:20:19,281 --> 01:20:20,509
He hurt me.

1039
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:31,755
But you have to take me to see him.

1040
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:34,621
You have to.

1041
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:41,263
Okay.

1042
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:57,150
( alarm beeps )

1043
01:21:27,682 --> 01:21:28,808
You're late.

1044
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:31,207
Put this on.

1045
01:21:46,935 --> 01:21:48,402
What the fuck is that?

1046
01:21:50,272 --> 01:21:51,864
You didn't bring a disguise?

1047
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:53,771
No one gives a shit what I'm up to.

1048
01:22:04,786 --> 01:22:06,276
KENNY: Where are you going?

1049
01:22:08,323 --> 01:22:09,881
The main road's this way.

1050
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:12,051
Yeah, but if we cut
through the construction site,

1051
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:13,594
we'll hit the railroad tracks faster.

1052
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:15,789
Good point.

1053
01:22:16,531 --> 01:22:17,725
After you.

1054
01:22:43,358 --> 01:22:44,620
I'm sorry, Mom.

1055
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:49,426
I just wanted to help you.

1056
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:54,161
I spoke with your father.

1057
01:22:54,235 --> 01:22:58,331
He and the girls caught a flight.
They should be here by morning.

1058
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:01,135
Did you tell him what happened?

1059
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:04,135
I told him there was a gas leak.

1060
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:07,008
I meant the--

1061
01:23:08,283 --> 01:23:09,807
I know what you meant.

1062
01:23:11,252 --> 01:23:12,651
I didn't tell him.

1063
01:23:13,588 --> 01:23:14,987
I don't think I will.

1064
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:20,487
Are you mad?

1065
01:23:23,898 --> 01:23:24,887
You know...

1066
01:23:26,868 --> 01:23:30,326
Even if I could manage the food...

1067
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:34,999
...can you really see <i>me</i>
running a marathon?

1068
01:23:38,713 --> 01:23:41,147
You just have to run
to the end of the block.

1069
01:23:41,216 --> 01:23:43,343
It's not as hard as you think it is.

1070
01:23:45,587 --> 01:23:47,020
Easy for <i>you</i> to say.

1071
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:52,417
No.

1072
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:54,790
It's not.

1073
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:03,096
Okay.

1074
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:05,862
I'll try.

1075
01:24:13,448 --> 01:24:14,881
Ow, ow, ow.

1076
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:16,478
( chuckles )

1077
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:20,310
( thunder crashes )

1078
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:31,692
Son of a bitch!

1079
01:24:33,601 --> 01:24:35,262
I knew you'd chicken out.

1080
01:24:41,643 --> 01:24:43,235
Where'd you get that shit?

1081
01:24:43,311 --> 01:24:44,801
Is that real?

1082
01:25:01,162 --> 01:25:02,288
You killed him.

1083
01:25:04,232 --> 01:25:05,756
Come on, man.
Stop jo--

1084
01:26:44,732 --> 01:26:51,228
WOMAN: ? You can't change
without someone's shadow ?

1085
01:26:55,843 --> 01:27:02,510
? 'Cause then it's gone
when you still shine ?

1086
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:13,722
? You can't change
to solve somebody's name ?

1087
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:25,098
? Don't blink until you're made ?

1088
01:28:40,915 --> 01:28:43,907
( <i>Why Not Smile</i>
by R.E.M. playing )

1089
01:28:46,954 --> 01:28:51,914
? The concrete broke your fall ?

1090
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:59,296
? To hear you speak of it ?

1091
01:29:04,038 --> 01:29:07,974
? I'd have done anything ?

1092
01:29:12,613 --> 01:29:16,982
? I would do anything ?

1093
01:29:20,154 --> 01:29:26,218
? I feel like a cartoon brick wall ?

1094
01:29:29,864 --> 01:29:33,857
? To hear you speak of it ?

1095
01:29:38,606 --> 01:29:41,473
? You've been so sad ?

1096
01:29:42,877 --> 01:29:45,675
? It makes me worry ?

1097
01:29:46,681 --> 01:29:52,278
? Why not smile? ?

1098
01:29:56,491 --> 01:30:01,224
? You've been sad for a while ?

1099
01:30:03,965 --> 01:30:09,699
? Why not smile? ?

1100
01:30:17,545 --> 01:30:21,504
? I would do anything ?

1101
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:29,854
? To hear you speak of it ?

1102
01:30:34,162 --> 01:30:40,067
? Why not smile? ?

1103
01:30:43,704 --> 01:30:48,403
? You've been sad for a while ?

1104
01:30:52,313 --> 01:30:57,478
? You've been sad for a while ?
