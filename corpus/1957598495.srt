MORNING, MR. PETERSON.

30
00:02:24,467 --> 00:02:27,166
MORNING, MARY.

31
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,500
WELL, IN TWO WEEKS, CONRAD BIRDIE,

32
00:02:34,532 --> 00:02:36,467
THE BIGGEST ROCK AND ROLL TEEN IDOL

33
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,233
THIS COUNTRY HAS EVER SEEN,

34
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:40,300
IS GOING IN THE ARMY!

35
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:43,467
THEY JUST DENIED OUR SECOND APPEAL.

36
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,833
WOULD YOU STOP THAT AND LISTEN TO ME?

37
00:02:47,632 --> 00:02:50,500
THIS COULD BE THE END OF THE ALMAELOU MUSIC CORPORATION.

38
00:02:50,532 --> 00:02:54,300
ROSE, DID YOU HEAR WHAT I JUST SAID?

39
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,632
WHAT IS THAT?

40
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,433
MY RESIGNATION.

41
00:02:57,467 --> 00:02:59,532
MY PILLS. WHERE ARE MY PILLS--

42
00:02:59,566 --> 00:03:02,266
THE LITTLE WHITE ONES?

43
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,333
NOT A WHOLE ONE! BREAK IT IN HALF!

44
00:03:04,366 --> 00:03:05,899
YOU'RE 39 YEARS OLD, ALBERT.

45
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:07,632
YOU CAN TAKE A WHOLE ASPIRIN.

46
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,200
HOW CAN YOU RESIGN AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

47
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:11,866
MY MIND IS MADE UP, ALBERT.

48
00:03:11,899 --> 00:03:14,666
AS YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN WITH ALMAELOU FOR EIGHT YEARS.

49
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:17,166
I'VE BEEN MORE THAN JUST A SECRETARY TO YOU.

50
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,933
OH, I GET IT NOW.

51
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,866
YOU WANT A RAISE.

52
00:03:21,899 --> 00:03:24,500
WRONG! YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT, ALBERT.

53
00:03:24,532 --> 00:03:27,666
ROSIE, IF YOU'RE REFERRING

54
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:31,233
TO ANYTHING OF A MORE PERMANENT NATURE...

55
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,300
WELL, I'M JUST NOT READY FOR IT.

56
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,899
BESIDES, THERE ARE RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES.

57
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:37,666
SPANISH IS NOT A RELIGION.

58
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:39,799
IF IT'S PART OF THE COMPANY YOU'RE AFTER,

59
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,566
THE ANSWER IS NO TO THAT TOO!

60
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,166
ALMAELOU IS ME, MOMMA AND LOU.

61
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,233
ANY CHANGE WOULD KILL THAT WONDERFUL WOMAN THAT BORE ME!

62
00:03:47,266 --> 00:03:50,200
NOTHING COULD KILL YOUR MOTHER, AL, EXCEPT A SILVER BULLET.

63
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:53,233
AND I WON'T DROP POOR OLD LOU, EITHER.

64
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,766
HE LOVED YOU, ROSE.

65
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,366
OH, I LOVED LOU TOO.

66
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,200
SURE, HE WAS WARM, HE WAS LOYAL, HE WAS LOVABLE.

67
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:00,766
BUT HE DIED SIX YEARS AGO.

68
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,933
BESIDES, HE WAS A WIRE-HAIRED TERRIER!

69
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:05,799
ANYHOW, I DON'T WANT A PART OF THE COMPANY!

70
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,467
THIS IS SOMETHING MUCH MORE IMPORTANT!

71
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,799
YOU'RE GONNA DISCUSS WHAT I THINK YOU ARE,

72
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,699
I'M IN NO MOOD TO DISCUSS IT!

73
00:04:11,732 --> 00:04:15,233
THERE'S NOTHING TO DISCUSS. CONRAD BIRDIE'S GOING INTO THE ARMY AND I QUIT!

74
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:18,266
YOU CAN GIVE UP THE BUSINESS, GO BACK TO COLLEGE.

75
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,532
ROSE, I AM UP TO MY EARS IN DEBT!

76
00:04:20,566 --> 00:04:23,899
CONRAD BIRDIE HAS A $50,000 GUARANTEE

77
00:04:23,933 --> 00:04:25,467
WHICH I CAN'T PAY,

78
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,599
AND I HAVE JUST TAKEN A SEVERE OVERDOSE OF ASPIRIN.

79
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:34,166
ALBERT, THIS MAY BE YOUR VERY LAST CHANCE.

80
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:38,266

JUST BECAUSE HUGO PEABODY GAVE YOU HIS PIN

DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO RETIRE FROM ALL SOCIAL LIFE.

241
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,233
GOING STEADY IS VERY IMPORTANT,

242
00:12:29,266 --> 00:12:32,266

243
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,166

00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:45,899
I'M SORRY, URSULA, BUT I'VE MADE UP MY MIND.

00:29:41,467 --> 00:29:44,233
LOOK AT HER, SONNY BOY, HOW NICE SHE LOOKS.

526
00:29:44,266 --> 00:29:46,732
IT'S A WONDER SOME OLDER MAN DOESN'T SNATCH HER OFF.

527
00:29:46,766 --> 00:29:49,866
WHAT A CATCH YOU'D BE FOR A CONVALESCENT.

MOMMA, WHAT I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT

532
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,833
ACTUALLY INVOLVES ROSE.

533
00:30:03,866 --> 00:30:06,166
( clears throat ) MAYBE YOU SHOULD SIT DOWN, MOMMA.

534
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,866
WHY? I KNOW MY SONNY BOY. HE LOVES HIS MOMMA.

535
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:12,566
HE ISN'T GOING TO SAY ANYTHING THAT'D BREAK HER HEART.

536
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:15,166
GO AHEAD, DEAR. WHAT ABOUT, UH...

WHERE ARE YOU, LOU?

541
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:25,266
STRUCK DOWN BY A BEVERAGE

542
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,467

ROSE FEELS, AND I AGREE,

546
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:37,433
THAT MAYBE I SHOULD GIVE UP ALMAELOU.

547
00:30:37,467 --> 00:30:38,766
- OH! - WHAT'S THE MATTER, MOMMA?

548
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,166
NOTHING IS THE MATTER. YOU KILLED ME, THAT'S ALL.

THE SUBWAY IS TOO CROWDED!

554
00:30:50,233 --> 00:30:51,933
NOTHING IS TOO CROWDED FOR A MOTHER.

555
00:30:51,966 --> 00:30:54,666
I'LL GO DURING THE RUSH HOUR. THAT'S THE WORST TIME.

556
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:56,933

00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,866
I DOUBT SHE'LL BE COMING.

878
00:48:11,899 --> 00:48:15,200
SHE'S NOT IN THE BEST OF HEALTH. ( coughs )

879
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,300
TAKE THEM UPSTAIRS, HARRY.

880
00:48:17,333 --> 00:48:19,533
MR. PETERSON WILL STAY IN THE SPARE ROOM.

881
00:48:19,567 --> 00:48:22,666
MISS ALVAREZ WILL ROOM WITH KIM. ISN'T THAT CUTE?

882
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:25,166
CONRAD BIRDIE IS STAYING IN OUR ROOM.

883
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,933
- WHERE ARE WE STAYING? - WITH RANDOLPH.

884
00:48:26,966 --> 00:48:28,467
ISN'T THAT CUTE?

885
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,233
( dog barking )

886
00:48:38,433 --> 00:48:40,233
( sighs )

887
00:48:50,766 --> 00:48:52,899
- ( snoring ) - ( sighs )

888
00:49:01,799 --> 00:49:04,300
( muffled ) AAH! OH!

889
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,200
WHAT DO YOU WANT, THE WHOLE BED?

890
00:49:09,233 --> 00:49:12,266
ROLL OVER. I CAN'T BREATHE.

891
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,732
THEN STOP ROLLING UNDER ME.

892
00:49:14,766 --> 00:49:17,200
IT FEELS LIKE I'M SLEEPING ON A PEBBLE.

893
00:49:17,233 --> 00:49:18,866
NOT A PEBBLE. YOU MEAN A PEA.

894
00:49:18,899 --> 00:49:20,899
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, "A PEA?"

895
00:49:20,933 --> 00:49:22,599
A PEA!

896
00:49:22,632 --> 00:49:25,200
GET UP AND GO TO THE BATHROOM, DEAR.

897
00:49:25,233 --> 00:49:27,467
NO, "THE PRINCESS AND THE PEA."

898
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:30,533
THEY TESTED HER TO SEE IF SHE WAS A REAL PRINCESS.

899
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:32,699
THEY PUT A TINY PEA UNDER HER MATTRESS

900
00:49:32,732 --> 00:49:34,533
TO SEE IF SHE COULD FEEL IT.

901
00:49:34,567 --> 00:49:36,266
AND SHE DID.

902
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:40,200
SO I AM A REAL PRINCESS AFTER ALL!

903
00:49:40,233 --> 00:49:42,366

I WANT TO HAVE THIS MESS CLEARED BEFORE CONRAD COMES DOWN.

"THIS MESS," KIM, HAPPENS TO BE MY BREAKFAST.

- I INTEND TO ENJOY IT. - MOTHER.

925
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:46,899
KIM, DEAR, YOUR FATHER HAS A PERFECT RIGHT

926
00:50:46,933 --> 00:50:48,699
TO ENJOY HIS BREAKFAST,

927
00:50:48,732 --> 00:50:51,467
BUT I'M SURE HE WON'T MIND IF WE QUIETLY START

928
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,433
CLEARING SOME OF THESE OTHER THINGS AWAY.

929
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,433
I KNOW IT'S BEEN A HECTIC MORNING, DEAR,

930
00:50:55,467 --> 00:50:57,833
BUT KIM'S GONE TO A LOT OF TROUBLE TO MAKE

931
00:50:57,866 --> 00:50:59,666
A SPECIAL BREAKFAST FOR MR. BIRDIE.

932
00:50:59,699 --> 00:51:02,233
I WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S READY AND WAITING

933
00:51:02,266 --> 00:51:02,999
WHEN HE COMES DOWNSTAIRS.

934
00:51:03,033 --> 00:51:05,433
AFTER ALL, HE IS A NATIONAL FIGURE.

935
00:51:05,467 --> 00:51:07,500
I WANT TO SHOW THESE NEW YORK PEOPLE

936
00:51:07,533 --> 00:51:10,266
WE KNOW HOW TO TREAT A NATIONAL FIGURE IN SWEET APPLE.

937
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:14,266
NOT THAT IT MATTERS MUCH TO ME PERSONALLY, BUT FOR KIM'S SAKE...

938
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,833
THERE, ALL DONE.

939
00:51:15,866 --> 00:51:17,766
DID YOU ENJOY IT, DEAR? GOOD.

940
00:51:17,799 --> 00:51:20,699
NOW IF YOU'LL HURRY ALONG, I'LL CLEAR AWAY THESE OTHER THINGS.

941
00:51:20,732 --> 00:51:23,333
DORIS, I AM NOT BUDGING FROM THIS TABLE

942
00:51:23,366 --> 00:51:25,833
TILL I'VE HAD MY COFFEE AND READ MY NEWSPAPER.

943
00:51:25,866 --> 00:51:28,467
I'M SORRY, WE ONLY HAVE ENOUGH COFFEE FOR OUR GUEST.

944
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,400
HOW ABOUT A NICE WARM ROOT BEER?

945
00:51:30,433 --> 00:51:32,567
MORNING, PA. HERE'S THE MORNING PAPER.

946
00:51:32,599 --> 00:51:36,567
HOPE YOU DON'T MIND, BUT I CUT OUT A FEW STORIES ABOUT CONRAD.

947
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,567
( sighs )

948
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:49,433
I HAVE TRIED TO RUN THIS HOUSEHOLD ON A DEMOCRATIC BASIS.

949
00:51:49,467 --> 00:51:52,200
I HAVE EXTENDED THE PRIVILEGE OF SELF-DETERMINATION

950
00:51:52,233 --> 00:51:55,467
TO BOTH THE WOMAN I'VE MARRIED AND THE CHILDREN I HAVE SIRED.

951
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,333
THE VOTE HAS BEEN DENIED NO ONE

952
00:51:57,366 --> 00:51:59,666
FOR REASONS OF AGE, SEX OR POLITICAL AFFILIATION.

953
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:02,866
THERE'S BEEN NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION,

954
00:52:02,899 --> 00:52:04,899
AND OPEN COVENANTS HAVE BEEN OPENLY ARRIVED AT.

955
00:52:04,933 --> 00:52:07,732
LAST NIGHT, I GAVE UP THE LAST PIECE

956
00:52:07,766 --> 00:52:10,699
OF MY FAVORITE PIE-- STRAWBERRY RHUBARB--

957
00:52:10,732 --> 00:52:14,433
TO A GUEST WHO REPEATEDLY REFERRED TO ME AS "FATS."

958
00:52:14,467 --> 00:52:16,933
TELEPHONE CALLS WERE MADE ON MY PHONE

959
00:52:16,966 --> 00:52:18,467
TO NEW YORK, CHICAGO,

960
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:21,233
FAIRBANKS, ALASKA AND HONG KONG.

961
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:23,300
ALL NIGHT LONG I LAY AWAKE

962
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:25,933
WHILE OUTSIDE MY WINDOW THREE HARPIES SHRIEKED,

963
00:52:25,966 --> 00:52:28,533
"WE LOVE YOU, CONRAD, WE LOVE YOU, CONRAD,"

964
00:52:28,567 --> 00:52:32,266
4723 TIMES!

965
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,300
I HAVE JUST LOST TWO FRIED EGGS!

966
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:38,699
GENTLEMEN, THE DEMOCRACY IS OVER!

967
00:52:38,732 --> 00:52:40,567
PARLIAMENT'S BEEN DISSOLVED,

968
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:42,266
THE MAGNA CARTA IS REVOKED,

969
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,632
AND NERO IS BACK IN TOWN.

970
00:52:46,833 --> 00:52:49,833
OH FOLKS, WOULD YOU MIND STAYING OFF THE PHONE FOR A WHILE?

971
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:51,899
I'M EXPECTING A LONG-DISTANCE CALL FROM NEW YORK.

972
00:52:51,933 --> 00:52:54,300
HE'S COMING! HE'S COMING!

973
00:52:54,333 --> 00:52:56,233
- HE'S COMING! HE'S COMING! - HE'S COMING!

974
00:52:56,266 --> 00:52:57,899
I'LL GET THE EGGS! YOU CALL THE KIDS.

975
00:52:57,933 --> 00:53:00,933
GIRLS, HURRY IF YOU WANT TO WATCH HIM EAT!

976
00:53:00,966 --> 00:53:03,266
( shrieking )

977
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,500
Woman: SORRY, DORIS, WE HAD TO COME TOO.

978
00:53:05,533 --> 00:53:08,732
WE'LL STAND QUIETLY BACK HERE.

979
00:53:08,766 --> 00:53:12,233
HERE HE IS! HERE HE IS! HERE HE IS!

1050
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:28,233
- WHAT I WANTED-- - THEY'LL SEND CAMERAS AND LIGHTS AND COSTUMES.

1051
00:57:28,266 --> 00:57:29,632
WOULD YOU FORGET ABOUT THE "SULLIVAN SHOW"?

1052
00:57:29,666 --> 00:57:32,933
THERE'S SOMETHING SERIOUS I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. IT INVOLVES YOU AND I.

1053
00:57:32,966 --> 00:57:34,666
"YOU AND ME," ENGLISH TEACHER.

1054
00:57:34,699 --> 00:57:36,433
ROSE, I'M SERIOUS.

1055
00:57:36,467 --> 00:57:39,433
I'M REALLY GLAD THAT YOU AND ME-- YOU AND I--

1056
00:57:39,467 --> 00:57:40,899
YOU AND ME, YOU AND I--

1057
00:57:40,933 --> 00:57:42,866
ARE OUT HERE AWAY FROM NEW YORK.

1058
00:57:42,899 --> 00:57:46,732
I WANT YOU TO KNOW I WROTE MOMMA AND TOLD HER NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

1059
00:57:46,766 --> 00:57:48,866
I'M DEFINITELY GIVING UP ALMAELOU.

1060
00:57:48,899 --> 00:57:49,933
OH, ALBERT, YOU DIDN'T.

1061
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:52,333
I WROTE TO HER THE DAY WE LEFT,

1062
00:57:52,366 --> 00:57:54,467
AND IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS

1063
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,599
- AND WE HAVEN'T HEARD A WORD. - OH, ALBERT!

1064
00:57:56,632 --> 00:57:59,400
THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS ON A CROWDED BUS.

1065
00:57:59,433 --> 00:58:01,666
BUT WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? I'M ONLY A MOTHER,

1066
00:58:01,699 --> 00:58:03,766
AND FOR A MOTHER, A BUS IS GOOD ENOUGH.

1067
00:58:03,799 --> 00:58:06,333
MOMMA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

1068
00:58:06,366 --> 00:58:08,300
DID YOU THINK I WOULDN'T COME?

1069
00:58:08,333 --> 00:58:09,300
A WOMAN GETS A LETTER

1070
00:58:09,333 --> 00:58:11,533
OBVIOUSLY WRITTEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS,

1071
00:58:11,567 --> 00:58:12,766
AND SHE SHOULD STAY HOME?

1072
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:17,166
"DEAR MOM, THIS IS TO LET YOU KNOW ALMAELOU IS DISSOLVED.

1073
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,732
YOUR FRIEND, ALBERT."

1074
00:58:18,766 --> 00:58:21,300
"ALMAELOU IS DISSOLVED." DISSOLVE ME.

1075
00:58:21,333 --> 00:58:23,266
WHO AM I, ANYWAY? A SICK OLD WOMAN,

1076
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,567
PROBABLY WON'T LAST THE NIGHT.

1077
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:27,333
ALL I WANT IS A SIMPLE STONE WITH ONE WORD--

1078
00:58:27,366 --> 00:58:28,866
"ALBERT'S MOTHER."

1079
00:58:28,899 --> 00:58:32,233
DON'T HIRE A LIMOUSINE TO TAKE ME TO THE FINAL RESTING PLACE.

1080
00:58:32,266 --> 00:58:33,699
I'LL WALK.

1081
00:58:33,732 --> 00:58:36,833
TELL THAT LADY FRIEND OF YOURS I FORGIVE HER.

1082
00:58:36,866 --> 00:58:38,866
SHE KNOWETH NOT WHAT SHE DONETH.

1083
00:58:38,899 --> 00:58:40,799
MOMMA, ROSE IS RIGHT HERE.

1084
00:58:40,833 --> 00:58:44,266
THIS IS ROSE?

1085
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:45,766
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

1086
00:58:45,799 --> 00:58:46,933
SHE LOOKS LIKE MARGO

1087
00:58:46,966 --> 00:58:48,899
WHEN THEY TOOK HER OUT OF SHANGRI-LA.

1088
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:52,799
FOR HER OWN SAKE, SEND HER BACK TO TIBET.

1089
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:54,533
AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT A SECRETARY.

1090
00:58:54,567 --> 00:58:57,799
I FOUND, ON THE BUS, A PERFECT SECRETARY--

1091
00:58:57,833 --> 00:59:00,632
A WONDERFUL, REFINED GIRL ON HER WAY TO AKRON,

1092
00:59:00,666 --> 00:59:03,266
BUT I PERSUADED HER TO COME HERE.

1093
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:07,699
SONNY BOY, SAY HELLO...

1094
00:59:07,732 --> 00:59:10,366
TO GLORIA RASPUTIN.

1095
00:59:11,433 --> 00:59:14,266
YOU ARE SO CUTE!

1096
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:17,666
MOMMA, I DON'T NEED ANOTHER SECRETARY.

1097
00:59:17,699 --> 00:59:18,766
I HAVE ROSIE.

1098
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:20,233
OH, BUT I DON'T JUST TYPE.

1099
00:59:20,266 --> 00:59:22,766
- YOU DO OTHER THINGS? - I TAP DANCE.

1100
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:25,866
I FIGURE I COULD HELP YOU WITH THIS SECRETARY THING,

1101
00:59:25,899 --> 00:59:28,233
AND YOU COULD HELP ME BREAK INTO SHOW BUSINESS.

1102
00:59:28,266 --> 00:59:31,333
GET A LOAD OF THIS, AL. MAE, CAN YOU HUM "SWANEE RIVER"?

1103
00:59:31,366 --> 00:59:33,200
MY FAVORITE SELECTION.

1104
00:59:33,233 --> 00:59:34,732
HIT IT!

1105
00:59:34,766 --> 00:59:37,400
( vocalizing "Swanee River" ) YEAH!

1106
00:59:37,433 --> 00:59:40,899
( vocalizing continuing )

1107
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:55,866
THAT'S HER FAVORITE PART.

1108
01:00:08,833 --> 01:00:10,799
"BRAVE-O," "BRAVE-O."

1109
01:00:10,833 --> 01:00:12,833
SO DO I GET THE JOB?

1110
01:00:12,866 --> 01:00:15,467
YOU CERTAINLY HAVE SOME WONDERFUL QUALIFICATIONS.

1111
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:19,500
I AM USED TO WORKING WITH MISS ALVAREZ HERE.

1112
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:22,333
DO YOU HAVE TO STAY DOWN THERE LIKE THAT?

1113
01:00:22,366 --> 01:00:24,266
ONLY FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES.

1114
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:27,366
MAE, COULD YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE HELPING HAND?

1115
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,233
AL, IF YOU COULD GRAB THE OTHER ONE. EASY DOES IT!

1116
01:00:30,266 --> 01:00:33,732
SONNY, FOR THE MOVIES, THEY COULD ALWAYS CUT AWAY WHILE THEY JACK HER UP.

1117
01:00:33,766 --> 01:00:36,666
SONNY BOY, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE GLORIA SOMEWHERE

1118
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:38,666
AND SEE HOW FAST SHE TYPES?

1119
01:00:40,899 --> 01:00:44,433
WE DO HAVE ALL THOSE RELEASES TO GET OUT.

1120
01:00:44,467 --> 01:00:47,699
I'M SURE THAT GLORIA COULD HELP OUT WITH THOSE.

1121
01:00:47,732 --> 01:00:48,966
THAT IS--

1122
01:00:48,999 --> 01:00:53,799
THAT IS IF IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO YOU, UH...

1123
01:00:54,833 --> 01:00:56,833
- ROSE. - ROSE.

1124
01:00:56,866 --> 01:00:59,766
WHY SHOULD IT MAKE AND DIFFERENCE TO ME, UH, ALBERT?

1125
01:00:59,799 --> 01:01:03,500
I'LL GO SEE IF I CAN FIND YOU A TYPEWRITER.

1126
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:08,500
DO YOU USE THE...

1127
01:01:08,533 --> 01:01:09,866
TOUCH SYSTEM?

1128
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:11,833
WHENEVER POSSIBLE.

1129
01:01:24,467 --> 01:01:26,500
TYPE SOME RELEASES, ROSE.

1130
01:01:32,533 --> 01:01:34,400
MISS ALVAREZ?

1131
01:01:34,433 --> 01:01:37,766
IT'S HUGO PEABODY. CAN I SPEAK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE?

1132
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,632
I'M LOOKING FOR KIM MacAFEE.

1133
01:01:40,666 --> 01:01:43,833
I WANT TO TELL HER SHE'S NOT TO KISS CONRAD BIRDIE

1134
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:45,366
ON THAT "ED SULLIVAN SHOW."

1135
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,433
IF SHE DOES, I THINK I HAVE TO--

1136
01:01:48,966 --> 01:01:52,300
MISS ALVAREZ, IS ANYTHING WRONG?

1137
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:54,266
MISS ALVAREZ,

1138
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:55,866
CAN I-- CAN I DO ANYTHING FOR YOU?

1139
01:01:55,899 --> 01:01:58,866
YES, HUGO, I THINK YOU CAN.

1140
01:02:12,833 --> 01:02:14,233
( bell ringing )

1141
01:02:20,467 --> 01:02:22,333
Sullivan: Now as you know,

1142
01:02:22,366 --> 01:02:23,799
in just about 14 hours,

1143
01:02:23,833 --> 01:02:26,333
one of show business' brightest talents

1144
01:02:26,366 --> 01:02:28,732
is going off to play a very special engagement.

1145
01:02:28,766 --> 01:02:30,632
Tonight, before he goes,

1146
01:02:30,666 --> 01:02:33,266
he wants to leave a certain lucky young lady

1147
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:34,833
with one last kiss.

1148
01:02:34,866 --> 01:02:36,300
Ladies and gentlemen,

1149
01:02:36,333 --> 01:02:38,433
we take you to Sweet Apple, Ohio,

1150
01:02:38,467 --> 01:02:40,567
where a typical American family--

1151
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,732
Mr. and Mrs. Harry MacAfee

1152
01:02:42,766 --> 01:02:44,766
and their children Randolph and Kim--

1153
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:46,899
- WHERE'S ED? - ...are gathered to bid farewell

1154
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:49,333
to a typical American soldier--

1155
01:02:49,366 --> 01:02:50,732
Conrad Birdie.

NOW, KIM, WHY DON'T YOU JUST STAY HOME

1284

01:10:51,567 --> 01:10:53,766

1291
01:10:57,533 --> 01:10:58,866
STAY OUT OF MY WAY, ALBERT.

1292

01:11:00,732 --> 01:11:02,699
DON'T WORRY, MOMMA. I CAN HANDLE HER.

1294
01:11:02,732 --> 01:11:05,833

1295
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,699
FOR THE LAST TIME, ALBERT, STAY OUT OF MY WAY.

1296
01:11:13,732 --> 01:11:15,766
I'M GOING OUT ON THE TOWN TONIGHT.

1297

1317
01:12:11,333 --> 01:12:14,467
- BUT DADDY! - YOU HEARD ME, I SAID UPSTAIRS.

1318
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:19,433
ROSIE WAS RIGHT-- YOU'RE ALL THE SAME,

1319
01:12:19,467 --> 01:12:21,699
FROM PUBERTY TO MUSSOLINI!

1320
01:12:21,732 --> 01:12:23,833
WHAT'S THAT? YOU DARE SAY PUBERTY

1321
01:12:23,866 --> 01:12:25,699
IN FRONT OF YOUR OWN FATHER?

1322
01:12:25,732 --> 01:12:27,833
NOT TO MENTION MUSSOLINI.

1323
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,799
OH, DORIS.

1324
01:12:30,833 --> 01:12:33,567
WE HAVE FAILED AS PARENTS.

1325
01:12:35,866 --> 01:12:38,899
( sighs ) I NEVER ASKED FOR MUCH FROM MY CHILDREN,

1326
01:12:38,933 --> 01:12:42,799
JUST RESPECT-- A LITTLE RESPECT.

1327
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:45,500
THAT'S ALL I ASK FOR-- RESPECT.

1328
01:12:45,533 --> 01:12:46,766
BUT DID I GET RESPECT?

1329
01:12:46,799 --> 01:12:49,533
I DID NOT GET RESPECT. I GOT NO RESPECT.

1330
01:12:49,567 --> 01:12:51,300
I RESPECT YOU, PA.

1331
01:12:55,866 --> 01:12:59,666
I DON'T WANT YOUR RESPECT. YOU'RE A CHILD.

1332
01:12:59,699 --> 01:13:01,799

AND THAT'S ONLY THE BEGINNING, ALBERT.

1738

FROM NOW ON, THE SKY'S THE LIMIT.

1739
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:04,699
PARTIES, BALLS, DANCES...

FOR DONATING THE WEENIES.

1757
01:36:16,533 --> 01:36:18,433
NOW I'D LIKE TO BRING UP A SUBJECT

1758
01:36:18,467 --> 01:36:21,166
THAT I'M SURE IS ON EVERYBODY'S MIND TONIGHT.

1759
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:24,500
IT'S A SUBJECT THAT'S DIFFICULT TO EXPRESS--

1760
01:36:24,533 --> 01:36:25,866

1761
01:37:22,933 --> 01:37:24,400

1782
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:51,300
HUGO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

1783
01:41:51,333 --> 01:41:53,732
MY WHOLE WORLD IS COLLAPSING BEFORE ME.

1784
01:41:53,766 --> 01:41:55,633
KIM HAS RUN OFF WITH CONRAD BIRDIE.

1785
01:41:55,666 --> 01:41:57,433
( gasps ) WHERE'D THEY GO?

1786
01:41:57,467 --> 01:41:59,933
MY GREATEST FEAR IS THEY'VE GONE TO THE ICEHOUSE.

1787
01:41:59,966 --> 01:42:02,699
WELL, LET'S GO.

1788
01:42:02,732 --> 01:42:04,333
RIGHT, HOP ON.

1789
01:42:15,633 --> 01:42:18,766
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE HAVE TO RUN AROUND LOOKING FOR SOMEONE

1790
01:42:18,799 --> 01:42:20,732
IT WOULD BE BETTER NOT TO FIND.

1791
01:42:20,766 --> 01:42:23,799
LISTEN TO ME, SONNY BOY, COME HOME, HAVE A CUP OF POSTUM

1792
01:42:23,833 --> 01:42:24,966
AND GO TO BED.

1793
01:42:24,999 --> 01:42:28,166
I TOLD YOU I'M NOT COMING HOME UNTIL I FIND ROSIE.

1794
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:30,866
IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK HOME, IT'S FINE.

1795
01:42:30,899 --> 01:42:33,567
IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA. WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME, MOMMA?

1796
01:42:35,300 --> 01:42:36,799
WHAT DID YOU SAY, DARLING SWEETHEART?

1797
01:42:36,833 --> 01:42:39,899
I SAID, "WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME, MOMMA?"

1798
01:42:41,866 --> 01:42:45,233
WOULD YOU MIND REPEATING THAT ONCE MORE, SUNSHINE OF MY EXISTENCE?

1799
01:42:45,266 --> 01:42:48,500
I SAID, "GO HOME, MOMMA."

1800
01:42:49,899 --> 01:42:51,833
I DON'T NEED YOU ANYMORE.

1801
01:42:55,300 --> 01:42:58,200
SO IT'S COME AT LAST.

1802
01:42:58,233 --> 01:43:00,533
AT LAST, IT'S COME.

1803
01:43:00,567 --> 01:43:03,799
THE DAY I KNEW WOULD COME AT LAST HAS COME AT LAST.

1804
01:43:03,833 --> 01:43:06,899
MY SONNY BOY DOESN'T NEED ME ANY LONGER.

1805
01:43:19,667 --> 01:43:21,166
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

1806
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:22,933
GET RID OF ME.

1807
01:43:22,966 --> 01:43:25,667
PUT ME OUT WITH THE GARBAGE.

1808
01:43:25,699 --> 01:43:29,366
JUST THROW ME OUT WITH THE USED GRAPEFRUITS

SHE LEFT THE DINNER TABLE WITHOUT EATING DESSERT.

1884
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:55,667

- SHOULD WE DRAG THE RIVER? - WHAT ARE YOU ALL DOING HERE?

1891
01:49:09,533 --> 01:49:12,533
CONRAD BIRDIE HAS RUN OFF WITH MY KIM.

01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:40,866
CONRAD BIRDIE IS TURNING SWEET APPLE INTO A SLUM!

1905
01:49:40,899 --> 01:49:44,300
- ( shouting ) - ROSIE!

1906
01:49:44,333 --> 01:49:47,233
ROSIE, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR BLOUSE?

1907
01:49:47,266 --> 01:49:48,933
WHAT'RE YOU DOING WITH A GUITAR?

1908
01:49:48,966 --> 01:49:51,600
ALBERT, KIM AND CONRAD ARE AT THE ICEHOUSE.

1909
01:49:51,633 --> 01:49:53,233
WHAT IS THAT, A NIGHT CLUB?

1910
01:49:53,266 --> 01:49:54,732
- NO, IT'S AN ICEHOUSE. - THE ICEHOUSE?

1911
01:49:54,766 --> 01:49:56,667
- THE ICEHOUSE. - THE ICEHOUSE?

1912
01:49:56,699 --> 01:49:58,899
- THE ICEHOUSE. - THE ICEHOUSE?

1913
01:49:58,933 --> 01:50:01,500
DORIS, CALL OUT THE NATIONAL GUARD

1914
01:50:01,533 --> 01:50:03,233
AND THE R.O.T.C.!

1915
01:50:03,266 --> 01:50:06,200
CALL MR. KEEN, TRACER OF LOST PERSONS!

1916
01:50:06,233 --> 01:50:07,033
CALL THE SHADOW!

1917
01:50:07,066 --> 01:50:10,500
LOOK HIM UP UNDER LAMONT CRANSTON!

1918
01:50:14,300 --> 01:50:15,866
WHOO!

1919
01:50:15,899 --> 01:50:17,833
TO THE ICEHOUSE!

1920
01:50:31,667 --> 01:50:33,600
( angry shouting )

1921
01:50:42,266 --> 01:50:44,166
( cheering, laughing )

1922
01:51:42,233 --> 01:51:43,300
( softly ) THE ICEHOUSE!

1923
01:51:48,766 --> 01:51:51,799
( coughing )

1924
01:52:00,866 --> 01:52:03,333
WELL...

1925
01:52:03,366 --> 01:52:05,200
HERE WE ARE.

1926
01:52:09,300 --> 01:52:10,866
THIS IS THE ICEHOUSE.

1927
01:52:16,533 --> 01:52:18,333
IT'S FUN, ISN'T IT?

1928
01:52:30,567 --> 01:52:34,133
( siren wailing )

1929
01:52:37,966 --> 01:52:43,133
WELL, WHEN YOU'VE BEEN HERE AS MANY TIMES AS I HAVE...

1930
01:52:51,799 --> 01:52:54,899
CONRAD, YOU SEEM A BIT NERVOUS.

1931
01:52:56,699 --> 01:52:59,266
MAYBE A DRAG ON THIS WEED WOULD HELP RELAX YOU.

1932
01:53:04,366 --> 01:53:07,933
HOW ABOUT ONE OF THOSE REEFERS I'VE READ SO MUCH ABOUT?

1933
01:53:07,966 --> 01:53:10,799
I COULD GO OUT AND GET YOU A FIX...

1934
01:53:10,833 --> 01:53:12,732
IF YOU TELL ME WHAT IT IS.

1935
01:53:13,899 --> 01:53:17,200
( spits )

1936
01:53:18,966 --> 01:53:22,433
WHEN YOU'VE HAD A DONKEY ON YOUR BACK AS LONG AS I HAVE...

1937
01:53:24,300 --> 01:53:28,899
SO YOU SEE, I REALLY KNOW THE SCORE.

1938
01:53:28,933 --> 01:53:30,799
I EVEN KNOW SOME OF THE WORDS!

1939
01:53:33,866 --> 01:53:35,633
"CONNUBIAN."

1940
01:53:35,667 --> 01:53:37,866
"PRE-MARRY-AL."

1941
01:53:37,899 --> 01:53:39,567
JAILBAIT.

1942
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:41,933
THERE YOU ARE, O SENSUOUS ONE!

1943
01:53:41,966 --> 01:53:43,866
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU EVERYWHERE!

1944
01:53:43,899 --> 01:53:46,200
THAT'S NICE. I THINK GOT TO GO NOW.

1945
01:53:46,233 --> 01:53:48,233
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND-- WE'RE COMING WITH YOU.

1946
01:53:48,266 --> 01:53:51,233
YOU SAID IT-- WE'VE GOT A LOT OF LIVING TO DO!

1947
01:53:51,266 --> 01:53:54,233
- WAIT, WAIT. - WE'LL NEVER GO HOME AGAIN!

1948
01:53:54,266 --> 01:53:56,233
KIM, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

1949
01:53:56,266 --> 01:53:58,933
OH, HUGO, I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU.

1950
01:53:58,966 --> 01:54:01,233
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

1951
01:54:01,266 --> 01:54:03,899
LOOK, I'M YOUR STEADY.

1952
01:54:03,933 --> 01:54:06,200
( girls screaming )

1953
01:54:07,567 --> 01:54:11,467
NO, LISTEN. THAT STUFF IS NOT AS MUCH FUN AS IT SOUNDS.

1954
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:13,400
LET'S HAVE AN ORGY!

1955
01:54:13,433 --> 01:54:15,467
( screaming )

1956
01:54:40,500 --> 01:54:42,667
( screaming )

1957
01:54:47,899 --> 01:54:50,266
THANK GOD YOU CAME!

1958
01:54:56,699 --> 01:54:59,600
OFFICER, ARREST THIS MAN!

1959
01:55:01,333 --> 01:55:03,266
OFFICER, YOU CANNOT ARREST THIS MAN!

1960
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:05,699
- WHAT'RE YOU TALKING ABOUT? - HE IS A FORMER EAGLE SCOUT

1961
01:55:05,732 --> 01:55:06,933
AND A SOON-TO-BE VETERAN.

1962
01:55:06,966 --> 01:55:09,433
HE IS A ROLE MODEL FOR THE YOUTH.

1963
01:55:09,467 --> 01:55:11,266
ALBERT, LET ME HANDLE THIS.

1964
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:13,233
MR. MacAFEE, DO NOT ARREST HIM!

1965
01:55:13,266 --> 01:55:15,200
THIS IS ALBERT J. PETERSON SPEAKING!

1966
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:24,200
WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK TO THE HOUSE?

1967
01:55:24,233 --> 01:55:26,899
I'LL GO TO THE COURTHOUSE AND TALK TO THE MAYOR.

1968
01:55:26,933 --> 01:55:29,766
I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND. THIS IS THE NEW ALBERT.

I'LL GIVE YOU THE COAT OFF MY BACK IF YOU'LL GIVE HIM UP.

01:59:46,732 --> 01:59:48,933
NOT A CHANCE... MOTHER.

2041
01:59:48,966 --> 01:59:52,233
THE CRUELEST WORD I EVER HEARD.

2042
01:59:52,266 --> 01:59:54,366
TO THINK I'D LIVE TO SEE THE DAY

2043
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:56,366
THAT I'D HAVE RELATIVES IN EL SALVADOR!

2044
01:59:56,400 --> 01:59:58,833
ADIOS, MOMMA.

2045
01:59:58,866 --> 02:00:01,899
ADIOS, ROSE.

2046
02:00:05,233 --> 02:00:07,600
OH, CALL ME MRS. PETERSON.

2047
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:45,166
COME ON OUT. THE COAST IS CLEAR.

2048
02:00:56,333 --> 02:00:58,667
MAN, YOU REALLY SAVED MY NECK.

2049
02:00:58,699 --> 02:00:59,866
I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT.

2050
02:00:59,899 --> 02:01:02,233
YEAH, BUT I STILL OWE YOU THAT GUARANTEE.

2051
02:01:02,266 --> 02:01:03,866
ALBERT, YOU DON'T OWE ME ANYTHING.

2052
02:01:03,899 --> 02:01:05,899
YOU GOT A CONTRACT WITH ME FOR LIFE.

2053
02:01:05,933 --> 02:01:08,133
LOOK.

2054
02:01:10,366 --> 02:01:12,200
THIS IS A BLANK PIECE OF PAPER.

2055
02:01:12,233 --> 02:01:13,933
I JUST SIGNED MY NAME TO IT.

2056
02:01:13,966 --> 02:01:16,633
YOU JUST PUT ON THAT WHATEVER YOU WANT.

2057
02:01:25,600 --> 02:01:27,866
THAT'S THE NICEST THING.

2058
02:01:30,266 --> 02:01:34,200
- IT'S OKAY. - Momma: HELLO, ALBERT.

2059
02:01:34,233 --> 02:01:36,233
ROSE, YOU LOOK GOOD FOR A CHANGE.

2060
02:01:37,500 --> 02:01:39,433
I KNOW ALL ABOUT THE TWO OF YOU.

2061
02:01:39,467 --> 02:01:41,600
DON'T WORRY. I WON'T MAKE A FUSS.

2062
02:01:41,633 --> 02:01:44,266
I'LL DO WHAT ANY INTELLIGENT MOTHER HAS TO DO.

2063
02:01:45,266 --> 02:01:47,200
GOODBYE, DEAR.

2064
02:01:51,266 --> 02:01:53,200
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE COAT.

2065
02:01:53,233 --> 02:01:54,667
YOU'LL HAVE THREE MINK STOLES

2066
02:01:54,699 --> 02:01:56,766

02:01:58,633 --> 02:02:00,667
( train whistle blowing )

2068
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:15,400
THE TRAIN'S COMING.

2069
02:02:15,433 --> 02:02:17,200
RIGHT ON SCHEDULE.

2070
02:03:04,966 --> 02:03:06,166
THERE YOU GO.

2071
02:03:07,467 --> 02:03:10,200
MOMMA, I HAVE NO TIME FOR ANY OF YOUR NONSENSE.

2072
02:03:10,233 --> 02:03:12,233
I WANT YOU TO GET ON THIS TRAIN.

2073
02:03:12,266 --> 02:03:15,200
- THE TRAIN RAN OVER MY HAT. - I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR HAT.

2074
02:03:15,233 --> 02:03:18,300
- A MOTHER DOESN'T NEED A HAT. - THE TRAIN'S MOVING. LET'S GO!

2075
02:03:18,333 --> 02:03:20,866
