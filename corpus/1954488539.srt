1
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:37,471
<i>Dear Vista, I've been meaning to
write this note for a long time</i>

2
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:42,176
<i>but as you know I'm not very good at
expressing myself. So I'll just say this.</i>

3
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:46,280
<i>I miss your smile. I would say that
I hope this note finds you well</i>

4
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,416
<i>but as these things go...
that won't be the case.</i>

5
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:36,991
<i>A few hours ago I found this
girl looking a little too peaceful</i>

6
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:40,094
<i>in the last bathroom
stall of The Devoe.</i>

7
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:43,831
<i>I didn't know what to think of it.
I checked her pulse, but...</i>

8
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:46,267
<i>she was gone</i>

9
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:49,603
<i>And the scary thing is she
reminded me a little bit of you</i>

10
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,606
<i>and just like you,
she left someone behind.</i>

11
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,775
I'm sorry you had
to see this, Richie.

12
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:58,312
A beautiful young girl
dead on the toilet seat.

13
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:02,216
I mean, nobody needs that
kind of excitement am I right?

14
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,752
What do you owe The Devoe?

15
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:09,223
Because that debt is gone.
It's gone, Richie. Okay?

16
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:11,258
You and me, we're even.

17
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:15,196
The money you owe everybody else,
I'm gonna look the other way on that too.

18
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:18,232
You're like a son to me, Richie.

19
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:21,001
I feel like a father to
you all these years.

20
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:25,673
I know we don't hang out together but...
that's how I feel.

21
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:27,675
I really feel that way. I do.

22
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:31,512
Take this. That's on me.
You don't owe me nothin'.

23
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:34,115
Take that and...

24
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:40,785
Just... just keep what you saw here
tonight between us alright? Hey. Alright?

25
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,991
I appreciate that, Richie.

26
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:48,395
The world is a cold and lonely
place without you in it, Vista.

27
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:50,495
I just miss you.

28
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:58,072
And since you've been gone I've
been accused of being an observer

29
00:03:58,172 --> 00:04:01,575
a user, a loner, a cleaner,

30
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:03,811
a failure and a fool...

31
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:07,348
but never a participant. No.

32
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:10,384
No one's ever accused me of that.

33
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:13,988
Anyway, I decided it's
time to call it quits.

34
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:18,659
The drugs no longer work.
I'm coming home to see you

35
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,760
and there ain't nothing
gonna stop me this time.

36
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,040
- Hello.
- Richie.

37
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,944
I need someone to pick up Sophia from her
school recital. Can you do this for me?

38
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:46,513
I know, I know,
we haven't spoken in a while

39
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:51,553
but I'm not gonna be able to pick her up
from school 'cause something's come up.

40
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,088
I'm just so fucked right now.

41
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:57,858
I'm in a fucked-up situation and
I need a favor on this one.

42
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,361
Say something.

43
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:02,730
Jesus Christ, I know you're
not doing anything important!

44
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:07,234
You want me to beg you over the phone?
This is me begging you, okay? I'm begging.

45
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:09,536
Listen, when you get there,
there's a password, okay?

46
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:12,773
Only she and I know it.
The password is "Chestnut."

47
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,241
Are you hearing me? "Chestnut."

48
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:18,379
Okay? Can you be there in 20 minutes?
Can you do this one fucking thing?

49
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,479
What's it gonna be?

50
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,083
Please, Richie.

51
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,225
Okay.

52
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:47,334
I've had the privilege
of seeing these children

53
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:50,504
grow and move on to
pursue their dreams

54
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:53,941
and I must say, this class
has some of the smartest

55
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,810
and most talented
children I've ever seen.

56
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:01,079
So let's have another round of
applause for the 5th grade choir.

57
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,722
My name is Sophia Holy Hill.

58
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:12,626
And for tonight's recital, I have chosen
"Because I Could Not Stop For Death"

59
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:16,563
by the 19th century American poet,
Emily Dickenson.

60
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,300
"Because I could not stop for death
He kindly stopped for me.

61
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,937
"The carriage held but just
ourselves in immortality.

62
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:26,006
"We slowly drove. He knew no haste.

63
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:29,841
"And I had put away my labor
and my leisure too...

64
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:43,757
"Since then, 'tis centuries and yet
each seems shorter than the day.

65
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:47,461
I first surmised the horses'
heads were toward eternity."

66
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:49,930
Thank you, Sophia.
Let's give a hand...

67
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,966
I'm not done yet.

68
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:56,434
I will now recite the exact
same passage in Mandarin.

69
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,796
- Password.
- Chestnut.

70
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:57,898
Where's mother?

71
00:09:57,998 --> 00:10:00,367
I have gymnastics
rehearsal in 27 minutes.

72
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:03,170
If I'm not there on time,
there'll be hell to pay.

73
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,972
After that, you've to escort me home.

74
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:09,843
I have a test tomorrow, I need to be home
by 7 in order to study for it properly.

75
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:14,482
If I'm not home by 7 p.m. on
the dot, there'll be hell to pay.

76
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:17,251
Well, now that we cleared that up

77
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:19,052
I don't know if you remember me

78
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:22,823
but... my name is Richard.

79
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,626
And I am...

80
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:27,661
your uncle.

81
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,761
I don't care.

82
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,639
So, what, you,
take school in the summer?

83
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,507
Yes.

84
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,609
What, did you flunk?

85
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:45,245
No, I'm skipping 6th grade.

86
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,345
You're skipping 6th grade.

87
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,849
Skipping 6th grade.

88
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:54,421
I loved 6th grade.

89
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,855
I loved it so much, I took it twice.

90
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,917
You don't have to go
beyond this point.

91
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:33,291
Okay, yeah.
Well, it's nice to meet you.

92
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,696
- Tell your mom I say hello.
- Goodbye.

93
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,807
<i>Dear Vista you're not
gonna believe this</i>

94
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:50,644
<i>but I now feel worse
than I did before.</i>

95
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:54,314
<i>I'm not even kidding. Still,
my plan remains the same</i>

96
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:57,150
<i>but I cannot bear to
return to the red water.</i>

97
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,186
<i>I'm gonna try a softer
approach this time.</i>

98
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:01,555
<i>Something that won't
leave us quite a mess.</i>

99
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:04,658
<i>Normally, as you know,
I try to stay away from the pills</i>

100
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:09,196
<i>because of the adverse side effects
especially the paranoid delusions.</i>

101
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:11,999
<i>They're usually the first to surface.</i>

102
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:14,401
<i>I really hope it doesn't happen now.</i>

103
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:17,868
<i>Particularly the one delusion
where I owe people money.</i>

104
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,146
Richie!

105
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,982
- Yeah?
- You got our money?

106
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,985
- Who is this?
- You know who this is.

107
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:35,222
And you know the number. It's $800.

108
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:37,924
$800?

109
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:39,726
Yeah, I thought it was $600.

110
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:41,662
No, that was yesterday.
Today it's $800.

111
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:45,432
Well, what if I give it to you tomorrow?
What's it gonna be then?

112
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:49,269
You won't have it tomorrow, Richie.
That's the point. You'll never have it.

113
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:52,172
- I'll have it tomorrow.
- Yeah? How you gonna do that?

114
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,609
Don't worry about it. Okay?
I'm gonna have it for you tomorrow.

115
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:58,679
I'm gonna have it for you
tomorrow at dinnertime.

116
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:02,949
- Dinnertime. So 5 o'clock?
- Dinnertime is 7 o'clock.

117
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:05,118
Dinnertime is 5 o'clock
where I come from.

118
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:07,154
Yeah? Well, I guess you
come from America.

119
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:09,456
I come from New York
where it's 7 o'clock.

120
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:12,259
You're full of shit. You ain't
gonna have our money by tomorrow.

121
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:14,961
- I ain't full of shit!
- You're so full of shit.

122
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:18,498
- You're so full of shit...
- You know what I'm full of?

123
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:21,301
I'm full of 20 sleeping pills,
you pile of dung shit.

124
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:24,104
So I'm gonna be long gone
by tomorrow comes around.

125
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:26,139
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, that's right.

126
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,709
I'll be facedown in a
puddle of my own puke

127
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:32,312
by the time you show up here, okay?
So meet me up whenever.

128
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:34,648
5 o'clock, 7 o'clock, I don't care.

129
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:37,918
- I'm gonna be long gone, you understand?
- You fuckin' psycho.

130
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:41,388
$600, $800, why don't
we just make it $1,000?

131
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,987
Go fuck yourself!

132
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,204
Richie.

133
00:13:57,304 --> 00:14:00,038
Richie.

134
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:09,182
- I'm coming to see you now.
- No, that doesn't work for me.

135
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,984
We'll just see about
those sleeping pills.

136
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:13,887
- You come tomorrow night, dinnertime.
- You just stay right there.

137
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:17,758
I'm gonna be long gone by
the time you come around.

138
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:21,061
- I'm already in the building.
- What?

139
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:23,597
I said I'm in the building, Richie.

140
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:24,965
Bullshit!

141
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:28,135
There's a party going
on up there, right?

142
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:32,604
Yeah, Richie. Party celebrating
the longest day of the year.

143
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,176
Nah, there ain't no
party going on up here.

144
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:41,282
Oh, yes, there is. They're playing
music up there. I can hear it.

145
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:44,151
Yeah?

146
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:47,554
What song are they playing?

147
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,856
It's a good song, Richie.

148
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:52,559
It's David Bowie, I think.

149
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:54,795
Yeah, that's it.

150
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:58,265
It's "Five Years" by David Bowie.

151
00:16:56,949 --> 00:17:00,654
I'm gonna shoot you in the
face with a bow and arrow.

152
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:02,455
She hasn't come home.

153
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:07,093
Mother hasn't come home yet.

154
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,362
Are you sure?

155
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:12,098
Pretty sure.

156
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,600
Okay.

157
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,469
Well then, I-I guess

158
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,370
I'll try to make it over
there in a couple minutes.

159
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,435
There's no smoking in the lobby, sir.

160
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:56,376
There's no smoking in the lobby, sir!

161
00:17:56,476 --> 00:18:00,013
Would you give me a fucking break?
It's my last day on Earth, okay?

162
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:01,614
- Hello?
- Hey, hi, listen.

163
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,183
- Jordan?
- Yeah?

164
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:05,719
These... these pills...
they don't, they don't work.

165
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:08,922
- Which ones? How can you tell?
- It says Opadin, you know.

166
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:11,291
That's supposed to put
you into a long sleep.

167
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:15,528
Oh, sleep. It's Opadin. Nah, man,
that's not what you asked for.

168
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:19,632
- What are you talking about?
- I thought you asked for Zolufen.

169
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:22,268
- Zolufen What is that?
- Yeah. I don't know.

170
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:23,870
Zolufen? What... what is that?

171
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,940
You know, it's for, like,
menopause or something.

172
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,409
- Menopause!
- I don't know. Yeah.

173
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:31,011
- Menopause? What...
- Yeah.

174
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,812
Why would I want a
menopause medicine?

175
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:35,115
I don't know. I don't ask
any questions, Richie.

176
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:37,250
- Menopause?!
- Yeah.

177
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,254
- Oh, you stupid, stupid...
- You alright? What?

178
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:45,089
Stupid! Menopause?
Really? Fuckin' stupid!

179
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:12,516
Hey, are you Margaret's husband?

180
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,889
No.

181
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:20,727
Well...

182
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,828
Well, I just wanted to
make sure she was okay.

183
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,934
Yeah, okay.

184
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:30,003
What's your, what's your name?

185
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:33,404
I'm just a friend.
She's my best friend.

186
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,542
And you think she's here?

187
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,545
Is that what you think?

188
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,551
You know...

189
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:47,879
if you're really her best
friend you know that...

190
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,990
she doesn't have a husband.
Even when she was married,

191
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:53,493
she didn't have a husband.

192
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:57,464
Hey, who are you? Who are you? Hello?

193
00:19:57,564 --> 00:20:00,133
Hello? Miss Best Friend!

194
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:03,968
Who are you, Miss Best
Friend Person who are you?

195
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,111
There was a...
blonde woman over here.

196
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,812
I bet.

197
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:14,912
Alright, never mind.

198
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:31,097
So she, she hasn't
called yet or anything?

199
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:32,332
No.

200
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:35,866
- Is she ever late like this?
- Never.

201
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,974
Well, let's not get worried, I guess.

202
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,876
Maybe... maybe it's
possible that she,

203
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,446
I don't know hung out with
some friends after work

204
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:50,583
- or got a drink or something.
- No. Never.

205
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:53,020
It's not possible?

206
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,822
No. It is not possible.

207
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,124
She never hangs out with friends.
She's never late.

208
00:20:58,224 --> 00:21:00,693
She never allows me to be late.
She never drinks.

209
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:05,999
She never smokes, and she never has left
someone like you looking after me. Ever.

210
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:09,235
Yeah, well, there's a
first for everything.

211
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:12,737
As soon as she gets home,
you can get back to your life.

212
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,509
- Did you draw this?
- Yes.

213
00:21:22,015 --> 00:21:25,182
Another artist in the family.
That's really good.

214
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:28,988
You know, it reminds me...

215
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:32,325
I draw too. I used to draw these
flip-books when I was younger.

216
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:34,425
You know what flip-books are?

217
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:39,663
Anyway, I had this cartoon
character named Sophia.

218
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:44,938
Sophia and all her little adventures.
Your mom used to love 'em.

219
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:47,240
She'd laugh at them,
she thought they were funny.

220
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,440
She thought they were real cool.

221
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,812
I don't know.

222
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:55,982
I don't remember us growing
up with anyone named Sophia.

223
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:58,751
Sometimes I wonder, if maybe

224
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:01,721
she named you after...

225
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,856
these flip-books I used to make.

226
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:07,627
I don't know. Maybe she
mentioned something.

227
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:09,760
She doesn't talk about you.

228
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,601
Actually, she said you
were passive-aggressive.

229
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:17,904
- Passive what?
- Passive-aggressive?

230
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:21,941
Passive-aggressive? Passive-aggressive?
What does that mean?

231
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:26,043
Look, I have a test tomorrow morning.
So if you wouldn't mind...

232
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,286
You got a pencil over there?

233
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,656
Make sure you return it.

234
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:49,736
<i>Dear Vista this is the
third draft of a letter</i>

235
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:52,438
<i>that is supposed to
only be written once.</i>

236
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:56,843
<i>I'm writing to you from a view of the
beautiful city that I know you loved.</i>

237
00:22:56,943 --> 00:22:59,746
<i>I, unfortunately, need to stick
around a little while longer.</i>

238
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:02,115
<i>But I'm starting not to feel so good</i>

239
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:05,116
<i>and I'm wondering how long
I can keep this thing up.</i>

240
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:16,160
Mom? Okay.

241
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,797
He's here.

242
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:25,738
I love you too.

243
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:28,639
She wants to talk to you.
You can use that phone.

244
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,379
Go into the other room.

245
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:35,014
- I give you one thing to do.
- What?

246
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:36,349
You dropped her off alone?

247
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:38,384
- She told me to.
- She told you to?

248
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:40,453
- I don't know what to do with her.
- Clearly.

249
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:44,157
Nothing changes with you. It's incredible.
You're a marvel of modern science.

250
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:48,995
You asked me to pick the kid up and I did.
You didn't tell me what to do afterwards.

251
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:50,296
What was the plan then?

252
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:53,633
You were gonna drop her off alone
and disappear for another 5 years?

253
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:55,601
Hey, I didn't disappear.
I didn't disappear

254
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:57,136
- You disappeared.
- Don't start with that.

255
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:59,472
You told me to fuck off,
I fucked off.

256
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:02,108
- For 5 fucking years?
- I don't see you calling me.

257
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,677
- I called you today. Okay?
- Yeah. And why is that?

258
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,979
I'm not getting into
this with you right now.

259
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,549
- I made an error in judgment.
- An error in judgment?

260
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:12,852
Like when you punched my husband
in the face in a public restaurant?

261
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,954
Darren can go fuck himself,
that little bitch.

262
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:16,756
That's very apologetic.
Thank you. That's great.

263
00:24:16,856 --> 00:24:19,559
That weasel. He's lucky I
didn't kick him in the nuts.

264
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:23,496
He's still reproducing, can you believe it?
I should've kicked him in the nuts.

265
00:24:23,596 --> 00:24:26,632
You don't have the ability to understand
the consequences of your actions.

266
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:30,970
You know what? I'm all out of sorrys.
I ran out of those in the 20th century.

267
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,139
Just leave the apartment.
I don't wanna fight.

268
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:35,708
What do you want?
I'm doing the best I can.

269
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,744
I've got a kid giving
me permanent stink-eye

270
00:24:37,844 --> 00:24:40,413
old people are yelling,
I don't know where you are

271
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:43,483
I don't know where I am,
I don't know what's going on.

272
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:46,552
Just get out of my apartment
and have her lock the door.

273
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:49,355
Why don't you have your blonde
friend take care of her?

274
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:52,291
I'm just a little tired of
doing all the wrong things.

275
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:53,626
What friend?

276
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:57,463
Your friend looking for you in the hallway.
Blondie McGee or whatever her name is.

277
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:59,432
What are you talking about?
What friend?

278
00:24:59,532 --> 00:25:02,902
Some cracked-out bird was
looking for you in the hallway

279
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,371
said she was your best friend.
I don't know.

280
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:06,839
What did she look like?

281
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:11,811
She was like, blonde and looked like she
was trying a key into your apartment

282
00:25:11,911 --> 00:25:14,845
and then she sprinted down the
hallway like a crazy woman.

283
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:16,780
Hello?

284
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,720
Oh, my God!

285
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,790
Look, Maggie... I don't have
a lot of time left, you know?

286
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,825
I'd rather not end things like this.

287
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:29,662
You need to get Sophia out of that
apartment right now. It's not safe there.

288
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:31,464
- Huh?
- Get her out of the apartment.

289
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:34,567
Go down the stairwell, exit through
the street not through 3rd Avenue.

290
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:36,602
- Go down a stairwell?
- Just do it!

291
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,338
- From the 20th floor?
- Get her out of the building.

292
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:42,809
Okay, so you want me to sneak
Sophia out of the side entrance?

293
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:45,144
Yes! That's exactly
what I want you to do!

294
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:46,612
What am I? James Bond?

295
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,182
You see that woman again,
you don't talk to her

296
00:25:49,282 --> 00:25:51,984
you don't interact with her,
you don't do anything stupid.

297
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:54,053
You keep her far away
from my daughter.

298
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:56,656
So, you want me to
stay with Sophia now?

299
00:25:56,756 --> 00:25:58,825
Just do one fucking thing right!

300
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:02,094
Please, just do this one fucking
thing that I tell you to!

301
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:05,164
Can you do this? Can you get
her out of there, please?

302
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:08,601
- Yes, fine, whatever. Okay. Fine.
- Are you listening to me, Richie?

303
00:26:08,701 --> 00:26:11,971
Yes, yes, steer her away
from Blondie, get her outta here.

304
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,474
Take her to your apartment.
I'll call you later.

305
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:16,008
Look, I'll do whatever you want.

306
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:18,611
Maggie, but I don't think
she likes me very much.

307
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:21,614
You know, I think she'd
like to be with her mother.

308
00:26:21,714 --> 00:26:23,314
Sophia, hang up the phone.

309
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:31,424
I don't want her to see
me like this, Richie.

310
00:26:31,524 --> 00:26:35,294
Why don't you tell me where you are
and we'll come over there to you.

311
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:36,929
Can you just...

312
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,732
Can you just get her out
of the apartment, please?

313
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:42,833
What's... what's going on?
Are you... are you alright?

314
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,305
This is my one phone call.

315
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:50,810
This is my one phone call.

316
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,043
What do you mean it's
your one phone...

317
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:55,212
Maggie?

318
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:07,193
She said to take me to your place.

319
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:09,629
She what?

320
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:12,798
- Oh, no, no, that's not gonna work.
- That's what Mother said.

321
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:14,934
Yeah, well, she's not
my mother, okay?

322
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:17,270
My apartment isn't exactly
suitable for guests right now.

323
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,704
Well, that's what she said.

324
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:21,274
She told me to take you
out of the apartment.

325
00:27:21,374 --> 00:27:23,676
There was no directive as
to any certain destination.

326
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,879
There certainly was. I'm not
budging until we sort this out.

327
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,481
Are you gonna picket me?

328
00:27:28,581 --> 00:27:30,516
I'll tell her you find
the terms unacceptable.

329
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:32,318
You do what you gotta do, okay?

330
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:35,388
We are not going to my place.
That is an indisputable fact.

331
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:37,488
She's not picking up.

332
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,326
What are you looking for?

333
00:27:40,426 --> 00:27:44,163
I don't know. I got a headache.
Something with electrolytes.

334
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:46,296
- Electrolytes?
- Where's your bathroom?

335
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,028
What are you doing?

336
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:17,628
Nothing.

337
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:21,267
Why? Who does this?

338
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,767
You know who does this?
Animals do this.

339
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:28,040
Huh? I don't understand.
Why would you do that?

340
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,876
Alright, I'll check the security
footage see who's responsible.

341
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:33,579
Here's some emergency money
for you to spend on me.

342
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,046
- Let's go, come on.
- Let's clear those out.

343
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:40,353
Hill. H-I-L-L. Margaret Hill.

344
00:28:40,453 --> 00:28:42,286
One moment please.

345
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,092
Yes, we do have Margaret
Hill in our system.

346
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:49,195
You do? Okay, so, what,
what is she doin' there?

347
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:51,998
I can't tell you what she
was brought in for, Sir.

348
00:28:52,098 --> 00:28:56,135
I can tell you she was transferred to
central booking about 2 hours ago.

349
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,738
Central booking, okay.
What... what happens there?

350
00:28:58,838 --> 00:29:02,508
She's placed in a holding cell and
she's waiting for her arraignment.

351
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:05,478
- She's in a holding cell?
- Yes.

352
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:09,649
Okay, what-what... Do you know
what time the arraignment is?

353
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:13,386
Let's see. Her arraignment
is scheduled for 4 a.m.

354
00:29:13,486 --> 00:29:16,656
4 a.m.? Are you fucking kidding me?

355
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:19,225
What am I gonna do
with the kid till 4 a.m.?

356
00:29:19,325 --> 00:29:23,095
I don't know how to respond...
Holy crow, I'm fucked.

357
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:25,496
I'm so fucking fucked.

358
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:28,732
Let's go.

359
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,011
What the hell is this?

360
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,916
It's called a bowling alley.

361
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:47,486
I work for the guy who runs the place.
We can bowl for free.

362
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:49,655
- I don't bowl.
- You don't bowl?

363
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:54,126
Well, this is all that I can do
for 10 o'clock at night, okay?

364
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:57,227
It's either this or the bar.
You know what I mean?

365
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:19,950
What are you doing?

366
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:24,824
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm doing homework.

367
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:28,127
Alright, so you don't bowl. Okay,
I get it. There's other things to do.

368
00:30:28,228 --> 00:30:31,361
There's food. There's arcade games,
there's other activities.

369
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:34,900
What don't you understand
about homework?

370
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,905
Alright, fine, but you know...
do you not ever have... fun?

371
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:43,743
- I mean, don't you ever let loose?
- Gymnastics is fun.

372
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:48,047
Gymnastics. Okay. So you did a
triple-backflip whatever you call it

373
00:30:48,147 --> 00:30:50,616
but you did it with the
face of an assassin.

374
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:53,719
- I mean, where are the smiles?
- You don't smile.

375
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:56,288
What about your friends?
What do you do with them?

376
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:59,725
I don't have many friends.
Is that what you wanna hear?

377
00:30:59,825 --> 00:31:02,592
Just me and Mother,
and that's just fine.

378
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:04,895
You and Mother?

379
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:08,968
You ever heard of the movie "Psycho"?

380
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:11,303
You know, there's always
a test, by the way.

381
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:14,173
Your whole life is gonna
be a test, alright?

382
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:16,976
I mean, sometimes I'd skip out,
I'd not do my homework.

383
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:19,476
Yeah and look how you turned out.

384
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,387
Gideon wants to see you.

385
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:33,592
- Gideon would like to see me?
- Yeah.

386
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:35,559
- What for?
- I don't know.

387
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,764
Well...

388
00:31:38,864 --> 00:31:42,134
I have... I have my niece here,
you know? I mean, I'm gonna...

389
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:46,105
- We need somebody to watch her.
- It'll only be a couple of minutes.

390
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:49,573
Get somebody to watch my
niece or I'm not moving.

391
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,712
I'll watch her.

392
00:31:53,312 --> 00:31:55,479
Get somebody else.

393
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,587
Look, I,

394
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:04,390
I have to go for a couple minutes

395
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,924
I'll be right back, okay?

396
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:10,060
You'll be alright?

397
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:29,648
- Richie!
- Gideon.

398
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:31,483
Who's the, who's the girl?

399
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:34,787
Oh, that's... that's my niece.

400
00:32:34,887 --> 00:32:36,288
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

401
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:39,725
- Brother or sister?
- Sister.

402
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:41,927
Yeah? How's she doing?

403
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:44,129
- She's in jail.
- Now that's cool.

404
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:47,733
Calls me tonight, out of the blue.
To torture me, I guess.

405
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:51,170
I haven't spoken to her in years.

406
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,972
You worked in The Devoe last night?

407
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:55,674
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

408
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:57,240
I got this...

409
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,678
I got this problem, Richie.

410
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:04,884
I... I met someone recently,
who changes the way that I see things.

411
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:08,721
The way that I operate.
It's a... it's a girl.

412
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:11,657
It's not just any girl.
She's, you know, she's red-hot.

413
00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:15,194
I wake up sweating thinking she
won't be lying next to me.

414
00:33:15,294 --> 00:33:17,096
Maybe I'm thinking I
might get burned.

415
00:33:17,196 --> 00:33:19,598
Whatever it is, it's the
worst-case scenario, you know?

416
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:23,936
I've dreamed up all the bad scenarios.
I mean, this girl, Richie.

417
00:33:24,036 --> 00:33:27,306
This girl has me under a
fucking spell, you know?

418
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:32,344
I just can't shake it. It scares me
sometimes, the things I'd do for her.

419
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:33,746
I know the feeling.

420
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:36,815
I know you do, Richie.
That's why I can talk to you.

421
00:33:36,915 --> 00:33:40,185
Because unlike these other assholes,
you have been in love.

422
00:33:40,285 --> 00:33:43,586
Am I right? With that girl?
What's her name?

423
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:46,992
- Vista.
- Vista. Right. Vista.

424
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:48,794
You're probably gonna
be surprised by this

425
00:33:48,894 --> 00:33:53,132
since you and I don't talk so much,
but when I met my girl...

426
00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:56,001
I kinda thought of you guys.

427
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:58,737
I thought of what you guys had.

428
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:02,274
Well, what's your girl's name?

429
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:05,477
See, that's the thing, man.
She's, she's gone, you know?

430
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:08,414
She's been ignoring me for
the past 24 hours or so.

431
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:12,082
She completely disappeared, you know?
Here. Take a look at her.

432
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,719
Beautiful, right?

433
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:19,625
Anyway, she doesn't
come home last night.

434
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:22,294
There's no call, no text, no e-mail.
There's nothing.

435
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:25,097
I ask around when was the
last people heard from her.

436
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:26,899
I don't like the responses, you know?

437
00:34:26,999 --> 00:34:29,268
Something about the tone
of a person's voice.

438
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:33,439
So, day keeps moving on without her and
my imagination starts running wild, Richie.

439
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:36,508
And I start thinking about other
guys I've seen her look at.

440
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:39,878
I started thinking about her friends
that she doesn't know I know about.

441
00:34:39,978 --> 00:34:43,716
I started thinking what I'd do to
someone if I found out he bedded her.

442
00:34:43,816 --> 00:34:47,519
I would shackle the fucker up
for a year and I would slowly

443
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:50,689
and systematically torture him every
day until he finally shuts down.

444
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:54,259
I would burn off all his fucking
skin is what I would do.

445
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,895
These are the kinds of things
I'm thinking about, Richie.

446
00:34:56,995 --> 00:34:59,329
I'm thinking about bad things.

447
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:01,831
Right.

448
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:24,988
So, do you recognize her?

449
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,592
- Richie.
- Yeah?

450
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:30,963
You do?

451
00:35:31,063 --> 00:35:33,063
Yeah, no, I mean, I, I...

452
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:37,903
I see her, I see her around
The Devoe sometimes.

453
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:40,406
I mean, I don't know her, but...

454
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:43,242
- Hard to miss, right?
- Right.

455
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:45,811
It's the arguments about the
little things that get you.

456
00:35:45,911 --> 00:35:48,047
We got in some little
spat about something.

457
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:52,384
I don't even remember about what, and then,
poof she's gone. She's out the door.

458
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:55,454
You know where she goes, Richie?

459
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:57,389
She goes to The Devoe.

460
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,490
- Really?
- Yeah.

461
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:02,895
She marches over to that shithole club she
texts me that she found her friend Flora

462
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:05,964
and that was it. That was
the last I heard from her.

463
00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:08,767
I got friends over there.
I keep tabs on the competition.

464
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:12,337
The bouncers tell me that she
goes into the club around 1 a.m.

465
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:16,241
and then she doesn't come out.
She goes in, but she doesn't come out.

466
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:20,877
At least, not through the front door.
You did the late shift last night, right?

467
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:24,514
So I wanna know.

468
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,119
Did you see anything?

469
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:29,421
- Did I see anything?
- Yeah.

470
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,924
Did I see anything?

471
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:33,926
My late shift is later than most.

472
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:37,930
As you know, I don't... I don't
see much of anything ever.

473
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,732
You know, most days,
nobody even talks to me at all.

474
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,901
I mean, nobody sees anything in me

475
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:46,738
and I don't see anything in...
in anybody else.

476
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:50,907
And that's... that's my life.

477
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:55,979
You didn't answer my question.

478
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,156
Forget it, Richie.

479
00:37:04,256 --> 00:37:06,556
You're good people, I just...

480
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:12,131
I don't know. I thought maybe you
knew something. You know, it's just...

481
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:16,001
my head is just all fucked
up right now, you know?

482
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:18,036
I-I'm sure that, you know

483
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:22,441
this will all... be sorted out.
I mean, these things happen.

484
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:24,776
- These fights, right?
- Yeah.

485
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:26,813
I mean...

486
00:37:27,613 --> 00:37:29,078
Look.

487
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:33,483
Heroin does strange things to people.

488
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,923
What was that?

489
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:44,496
I... I was just saying that I think

490
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,031
How'd you know she does heroin?

491
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:48,333
- How would you know that?
- I must have misunderstood.

492
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:49,635
What's there to misunderstand?

493
00:37:49,735 --> 00:37:51,937
You said heroin, I didn't
say anything about that.

494
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:53,972
- Didn't you?
- No, no. I didn't tell you.

495
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:57,109
I haven't even told my best friends.
Why would I tell you?

496
00:37:57,209 --> 00:38:00,212
You said that that she went
looking for her friend Flora.

497
00:38:00,312 --> 00:38:03,980
Flora is slang for heroin.
Flora is slang for heroin.

498
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:08,453
You ever heard of that?

499
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:11,190
Ever heard of Flora?

500
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:16,061
No. Boy here knows everything about that,
he says no. Would you fuckin' lie to me?

501
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:18,363
I had a very intimate
relationship with the lady.

502
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:21,166
I know all her secrets and
I know all her names.

503
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:23,735
I know who Flora is.
I know what she does.

504
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:27,136
I don't know much about many things,
but I do know that.

505
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,340
I have my niece with me.

506
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:36,179
Yesterday, I would've told you to
kill me but today I have a niece.

507
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,576
Hey, listen, it's Richie.

508
00:39:06,076 --> 00:39:08,580
About that girl from last night

509
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,683
Gideon is asking around about her

510
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:16,021
and he's... he's saying that she
was his girlfriend and I'm just...

511
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:17,821
Hold on a second.

512
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,961
- Hello?
- Bill. Bill?

513
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:27,165
What happened with
that girl last night?

514
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:30,168
Did she... Did the
police show up or...

515
00:39:30,268 --> 00:39:31,968
What girl?

516
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:38,374
- The girl from the bathroom.
- What girl? From what bathroom?

517
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:45,215
Was there a girl in the bathroom last night,
Richie? Is that what you're sayin'?

518
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:48,086
No.

519
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:51,957
You'd tell us if you saw something
in the bathroom last night

520
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:54,157
wouldn't you, Richie?

521
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:59,662
I didn't see anything in
the bathroom last night.

522
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,232
Where are you, Richie?

523
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,568
Who are you with?

524
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,307
Let's just make this easy.

525
00:40:08,407 --> 00:40:11,310
Why don't you come into
your shift early tonight?

526
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:13,410
Say, 1:30?

527
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,780
Yeah, sure.

528
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:49,007
<i>Dear Vista, even Death
doesn't want me.</i>

529
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:54,146
<i>But he wanted that dead bird who's flown
back into my night again to haunt me.</i>

530
00:41:54,246 --> 00:41:58,417
<i>Meanwhile, my sister
normally Miss Perfect Pants</i>

531
00:41:58,517 --> 00:42:02,785
<i>has gotten herself into some sort
of jam and left me with her kid.</i>

532
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,191
- Richie.
- Devin.

533
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:08,760
<i>I wish I was on my way to seeing you</i>

534
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,563
<i>but the night is really
starting to get away from me</i>

535
00:42:11,663 --> 00:42:14,266
<i>and there doesn't seem
to be any end in sight.</i>

536
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:17,469
- Homework done?
- This place is unacceptable.

537
00:42:17,569 --> 00:42:20,639
- Take me to your apartment.
- Not gonna happen.

538
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:24,643
I have a test tomorrow at
8:22 a.m. for second period

539
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:29,548
and so help me God, if I bomb
that test I'm going to kill you.

540
00:42:29,948 --> 00:42:32,682
Yeah, well, get in line.

541
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:02,481
We gotta go somewhere.
I gotta pick something up.

542
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:04,216
Is it at your apartment?

543
00:43:04,316 --> 00:43:07,018
Is what at my apartment?
What I gotta pick up? No.

544
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:09,421
If it's not to your apartment,
I'm not going.

545
00:43:09,521 --> 00:43:12,791
It's just around the corner, okay?
It's gonna take 2 minutes.

546
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:14,390
I'm not going.

547
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:22,000
Game over.
Pack your bag and let's go.

548
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:51,296
Hey, man.

549
00:43:51,396 --> 00:43:53,331
Look, I'll be back in
a second, alright?

550
00:43:53,431 --> 00:43:57,767
Just stay right here. I'll just
be one second, okay? One second.

551
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:17,222
What's wrong? What's the problem?

552
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:19,357
- I wanna go home.
- Look, I'm sorry, okay?

553
00:44:19,457 --> 00:44:20,892
- I wanna go home.
- I'm sorry.

554
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,694
- You spent the money.
- I what?

555
00:44:22,794 --> 00:44:24,496
Your money?
I didn't spend your money.

556
00:44:24,596 --> 00:44:27,566
I got it right here. What does
your mother say about me?

557
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:31,002
- She doesn't talk about you.
- Would you please stop walking?

558
00:44:31,102 --> 00:44:33,104
Look, I went to get these...
these flip-books

559
00:44:33,204 --> 00:44:35,605
I was telling you about, alright?

560
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:39,811
I didn't spend your money.
I wouldn't do that.

561
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:43,515
I didn't spend your money
and I don't lie, alright?

562
00:44:43,615 --> 00:44:45,614
I don't lie.

563
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,650
I just...

564
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:52,123
I thought you'd wanna
see these, I don't know.

565
00:44:52,223 --> 00:44:53,391
Why were they in there?

566
00:44:53,491 --> 00:44:57,994
Because... because I used to,
I used to live there.

567
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:02,067
Look, I'm sorry, alright?
I shouldn't have taken you there.

568
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:04,836
I wasn't clear-headed, I just was...

569
00:45:04,936 --> 00:45:07,704
I thought you might
like to see these.

570
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,208
Would you like to see one?

571
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:24,623
She got shot by an arrow?

572
00:45:24,723 --> 00:45:27,392
Yeah, yeah, see? It's like...
it's like Looney Tunes.

573
00:45:27,492 --> 00:45:31,029
See? She dies, right? But then,
she comes back to life, see?

574
00:45:31,129 --> 00:45:33,563
Sophia always comes back to life.

575
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:45,076
How did you do all this?

576
00:45:45,176 --> 00:45:48,431
Well, I was bored, you know?
I was a kid and your mother and I,

577
00:45:48,532 --> 00:45:51,683
we didn't have a lot
of toys or video games

578
00:45:51,783 --> 00:45:54,954
so we had to find ways
to entertain ourselves.

579
00:45:55,754 --> 00:45:57,455
How many of them did you make?

580
00:45:57,555 --> 00:46:00,025
I got a box of these.
Like 60 of these.

581
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:02,093
- 60?
- Yeah, like 60 of them.

582
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:03,928
- 60?
- Yeah. Well, I was bored!

583
00:46:04,028 --> 00:46:06,364
- Yeah, but 60?
- I know, it's ridiculous.

584
00:46:06,464 --> 00:46:09,901
Can we please get into the
air conditioning? Please?

585
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:11,569
- Favorite number?
- 3.

586
00:46:11,669 --> 00:46:13,004
- Favorite color?
- Blue.

587
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:15,073
- Favorite book?
- Don't read.

588
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:17,375
- Who's the letter to?
- What letter?

589
00:46:17,475 --> 00:46:19,844
The girl you've been
writing a letter to.

590
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:21,179
Doesn't matter.

591
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:23,915
- But I wanna know.
- That doesn't matter.

592
00:46:24,015 --> 00:46:25,984
You know you're not
allowed to smoke indoors?

593
00:46:26,084 --> 00:46:27,585
Yes.

594
00:46:27,685 --> 00:46:31,089
You know smoking is one of the
leading causes of lung cancer?

595
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:34,059
- Yes, I do.
- Then why do you smoke?

596
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:37,796
Because it feels really good.

597
00:46:37,896 --> 00:46:41,132
You don't look really healthy.
Do you take vitamins?

598
00:46:41,232 --> 00:46:43,001
- I take drugs.
- Those aren't vitamins.

599
00:46:43,101 --> 00:46:44,836
- I know.
- Do you have a girlfriend?

600
00:46:44,936 --> 00:46:47,172
- No.
- Why not?

601
00:46:47,272 --> 00:46:48,707
It doesn't matter.

602
00:46:48,807 --> 00:46:50,542
Maybe it's 'cause you
don't look healthy.

603
00:46:50,642 --> 00:46:52,977
Maybe. Can you please
finish up eating your fries?

604
00:46:53,077 --> 00:46:57,082
- Maybe it's because of the bad breath.
- I don't have the bad breath.

605
00:46:57,182 --> 00:46:59,384
Smoking is one of the leading
causes of gingivitis.

606
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:01,586
You're really giving me
a headache right now...

607
00:47:01,686 --> 00:47:03,121
You don't take care of yourself.

608
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:05,323
You're giving me a huge
migraine headache.

609
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:07,459
- You should get a girlfriend.
- I can't...

610
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:09,859
You clearly can't take
care of yourself.

611
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:16,098
- Totally believe you.
- You have to do it.

612
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,810
Will you please stop knocking?

613
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:28,110
There's a little girl in there,
can you please stop knocking?

614
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:35,787
Excuse me. Can you stop... knocking?

615
00:47:35,887 --> 00:47:37,320
Hello?

616
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:44,560
Will you... will you please shut up?

617
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:49,768
Will you please shut up? Shut up!

618
00:47:49,868 --> 00:47:52,303
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

619
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:55,807
Shut up. Would you shut the hell up?

620
00:47:55,907 --> 00:47:58,643
Just shut the fuck up! Please!

621
00:47:58,743 --> 00:48:01,513
Shut your big, fat cow mouths!

622
00:48:01,613 --> 00:48:06,816
Shut it the fuck up! Just do it, man!
Shut it, please! God, shut up!

623
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,519
Seriously, alright. Hold on.

624
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:43,521
Listen, get Bruce on the phone.

625
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:48,090
Ask him to find out what's up with
Richie's sister. Have him help her out.

626
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:51,596
What's going on with my mom?

627
00:48:51,696 --> 00:48:55,898
I'm not gonna screw anything else up
by telling you something I shouldn't.

628
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:58,935
It's from Gideon.

629
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:09,514
How come you guys don't talk anymore?

630
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:12,517
Well, it's not just one thing.

631
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:14,853
- I wanna know.
- It's a bunch of things.

632
00:49:14,953 --> 00:49:18,356
We grew up in an unhealthy home,
your mother and I.

633
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:23,194
She had you when she was really young.
She had you when she was a teenager.

634
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:27,098
And I guess, she didn't wanna
bring you up in that environment

635
00:49:27,198 --> 00:49:29,000
and I was part of that environment.

636
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:32,969
So what happened was you grew apart?

637
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:36,472
What happened was...

638
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:40,376
I became a bad person.

639
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:44,580
I... I don't think that at all.

640
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:50,353
I... I think you're a dumb person.

641
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:56,459
Oh, my God! I love this song!

642
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:20,111
- Come dance with me.
- I don't dance.

643
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:22,144
- Come on!
- I don't dance.

644
00:51:24,048 --> 00:51:25,683
- Come on.
- I don't dance.

645
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,588
- What happened?
- Nothing. Nothing. It's just...

646
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,926
It was an accident.

647
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:46,335
I think you need stitches.

648
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:02,887
You're the public defender?

649
00:52:02,987 --> 00:52:05,390
No, I am not.
My name is Bruce Warham.

650
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:07,525
- I work for Gideon Young.
- Who?

651
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:10,628
Mr. Young has asked
me to represent you

652
00:52:10,728 --> 00:52:12,663
- as a favor to your brother.
- My brother?

653
00:52:12,763 --> 00:52:15,133
From what I understand,
the gentleman who assaulted you

654
00:52:15,233 --> 00:52:17,935
- has filed a cross complaint, right?
- My brother?

655
00:52:18,035 --> 00:52:20,069
I want you to
know something. I...

656
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:26,208
I'm really glad that I met you.

657
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:29,047
- Richie, are you alright?
- Yeah.

658
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:30,515
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

659
00:52:30,615 --> 00:52:33,951
I'm sorry, Miss Hill,
I don't have a lot of time.

660
00:52:34,051 --> 00:52:36,120
Are you aware of the cross complaint?

661
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,855
Yes.

662
00:52:37,955 --> 00:52:39,991
You should know that

663
00:52:40,091 --> 00:52:43,995
even though you're the one with
the shiner, he also has grounds.

664
00:52:44,095 --> 00:52:46,631
Grounds? Grounds to what?

665
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:48,900
Oh, my God. You're bleeding a lot.

666
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,768
- There's a pharmacy there.
- No, no, no.

667
00:52:50,868 --> 00:52:54,105
I'm gonna go there.
I promise, I'll be right back.

668
00:52:54,205 --> 00:52:57,075
Well, he could sue you, for one.

669
00:52:57,175 --> 00:53:00,778
He could press charges, although I
don't think that's very likely, but...

670
00:53:00,878 --> 00:53:04,082
they could try and frame it that way.
You should know that.

671
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:06,017
Excuse me.

672
00:53:06,117 --> 00:53:08,019
This man hit me, he assaulted me.

673
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:10,121
- I understand.
- So why am in a holding cell?

674
00:53:10,221 --> 00:53:12,657
How can he sue me if I'm the victim?

675
00:53:12,757 --> 00:53:15,693
This man punched a wall
and then he punched me.

676
00:53:15,793 --> 00:53:19,061
But you were sleeping
with this man, right?

677
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:22,555
This man is married, right?
This man has children,

678
00:53:22,656 --> 00:53:26,804
this man has a lawyer who can frame
this any which way he wants.

679
00:53:26,904 --> 00:53:29,040
But I didn't know he was married.

680
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:31,976
I understand that, but do
you see where I'm going?

681
00:53:32,076 --> 00:53:34,946
You're the mistress.

682
00:53:35,046 --> 00:53:36,848
I'm what?

683
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:39,248
You're the other woman.

684
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:42,987
I'm the other woman.

685
00:53:43,087 --> 00:53:45,389
It won't hold water.
I'll take care of it.

686
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:48,090
We'll get you out of
here in a few hours.

687
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,061
Miss Hill, it'll be fine.

688
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:25,122
Hey, Richie.
This might sting a little.

689
00:55:25,222 --> 00:55:27,124
- Jesus Christ!
- I'm sorry.

690
00:55:27,224 --> 00:55:28,926
It'll be over in a second. Breathe.

691
00:55:29,026 --> 00:55:30,528
- Breathe, Richie.
- I'm fine.

692
00:55:30,628 --> 00:55:32,396
Then count to 3, then breathe out.

693
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:35,900
This is a temporary fix.
We need to get you to a hospital.

694
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,802
- No, no hospitals.
- Go to a doctor.

695
00:55:37,902 --> 00:55:39,370
I ain't goin' to a doctor.

696
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:42,206
If you won't do it
for you, do it for me.

697
00:55:42,306 --> 00:55:44,875
Look, I just wanna get
you back home safe.

698
00:55:44,975 --> 00:55:47,778
I just wanna do one
thing right, okay?

699
00:55:47,878 --> 00:55:49,814
Then what? I'll have
to worry about you?

700
00:55:49,914 --> 00:55:52,617
That I'll never see you again?
That you'll be gone forever?

701
00:55:52,717 --> 00:55:54,986
Instead of thinking about yourself,
think about me.

702
00:55:55,086 --> 00:55:58,987
How's Sophia supposed to go on more
adventures if you're not around?

703
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:05,196
Sophia's gonna have a lot
of adventures, no matter what.

704
00:56:05,296 --> 00:56:07,098
I know you're down
on yourself, Richard

705
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:09,400
but there are much worse
people out there, alright?

706
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,203
Look, your mother doesn't want
me around you for a reason

707
00:56:12,303 --> 00:56:15,373
- and they have good reasons.
- You're better than a lot of people.

708
00:56:15,473 --> 00:56:18,476
At least you wouldn't say
that I shouldn't exist.

709
00:56:18,576 --> 00:56:22,313
Huh? Who... who says
you shouldn't exist?

710
00:56:22,413 --> 00:56:25,149
- Dad.
- Dad? Darren?

711
00:56:25,249 --> 00:56:27,451
Yeah, he's a jerk.

712
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:29,854
- When does he say that?
- All the time.

713
00:56:29,954 --> 00:56:33,691
His life would've been better.
I see him on the weekends.

714
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:36,827
Life would be better?
What does your mom say about this?

715
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:39,130
I don't bother mom with it.
It's just noise.

716
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:41,932
He called me a failed abortion
in front of his friends.

717
00:56:42,032 --> 00:56:44,368
- Failed abortion?
- It's just his idea of humor.

718
00:56:44,468 --> 00:56:46,437
It's just the way he is.

719
00:56:46,537 --> 00:56:48,873
Just the way he is?

720
00:56:48,973 --> 00:56:51,442
Just the way he is.

721
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:54,111
Does he still work at that,

722
00:56:54,211 --> 00:56:56,345
the store down the street?
That music store?

723
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:02,351
Does he work there on Wednesdays?

724
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:18,869
- We're closing in a few minutes.
- Darren working here? Darren here?

725
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:20,404
- He's in the workshop.
- The workshop.

726
00:57:20,504 --> 00:57:23,806
Give me one minute. One minute.
Stay there for one minute.

727
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:54,739
- What the f... Richie?
- Failed abortion?

728
00:57:54,839 --> 00:57:56,907
- What the fuck are you...
- A failed abortion?

729
00:57:57,007 --> 00:57:59,308
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about!

730
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:02,177
Richie, what the fuck?

731
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:10,486
Get the fuck off!

732
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:46,054
Fuck.

733
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:52,595
What the fuck, Richie! What the...

734
00:58:55,398 --> 00:59:01,039
I don't know what there is to live for
anymore, Darren but I swear to God...

735
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,542
I swear to God...

736
00:59:04,742 --> 00:59:09,313
if you say any more fucked-up things
to my sister or her kid again

737
00:59:09,413 --> 00:59:11,613
I will stay alive.

738
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:16,451
I will stay alive to make sure
your life is a living hell.

739
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:23,926
What the fuck, man?

740
01:01:12,603 --> 01:01:14,605
- Have a seat, Richie.
- No, that's okay.

741
01:01:14,705 --> 01:01:16,707
We're not stickin' around.
I gotta get her home.

742
01:01:16,807 --> 01:01:18,309
- I'm hungry.
- No, you're not.

743
01:01:18,409 --> 01:01:19,843
Sure I am.

744
01:01:19,943 --> 01:01:21,845
Howdy, folks.

745
01:01:21,945 --> 01:01:24,113
I'll have some of those ribs, please.

746
01:01:26,984 --> 01:01:29,653
- With some vegetables.
- I don't want vegetables.

747
01:01:29,753 --> 01:01:32,189
Put some vegetables in there.

748
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:34,224
- These are vegetables.
- Those don't have vegetables.

749
01:01:34,324 --> 01:01:37,294
Please put some green things in there.
Green vegetables.

750
01:01:37,394 --> 01:01:41,897
- Got it. Greenish vegetables.
- Thank you.

751
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:46,601
Guys.

752
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:54,278
So who is this fine
young lady, Richie?

753
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:56,080
My niece, Sophia.

754
01:01:56,180 --> 01:02:00,148
Hello, Miss Sophia.
Delightful to meet you.

755
01:02:05,155 --> 01:02:07,057
Precious.

756
01:02:07,157 --> 01:02:09,328
You never told me you had family.

757
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:13,697
You never told me you were
friends with Gideon either.

758
01:02:13,797 --> 01:02:18,335
I'm not friends with Gideon. I work
for him the same as I work for you.

759
01:02:18,435 --> 01:02:21,071
Is that all I am, Richie?

760
01:02:21,171 --> 01:02:23,341
Just the boss man?

761
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:26,942
Did you make that date
with Flora last night?

762
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:29,847
No. That stuff will kill you.

763
01:02:34,985 --> 01:02:38,122
Is that what you think
I was trying to do?

764
01:02:40,791 --> 01:02:43,794
Is that why you think
I gave it to you?

765
01:02:43,894 --> 01:02:45,329
- Gave what?
- 8 years.

766
01:02:45,429 --> 01:02:49,566
8 years you worked for me.
I never asked you for nothin'.

767
01:02:49,666 --> 01:02:52,002
I treated you great,

768
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:55,205
even when you went across
the street to work for that kid.

769
01:02:55,305 --> 01:02:57,508
Never yelled at you,
never made you feel small

770
01:02:57,608 --> 01:02:59,043
never asked what was bothering you.

771
01:02:59,143 --> 01:03:02,079
- Never cared.
- I cared enough to leave you alone!

772
01:03:02,179 --> 01:03:05,449
I respected that your business
was your own business!

773
01:03:05,549 --> 01:03:08,385
Even when it cost me money!

774
01:03:08,485 --> 01:03:13,090
Even when you couldn't afford to live
in the city no more, I lent you money!

775
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:16,360
Pretended like you had a home.
Like you had a life.

776
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:19,296
- Like we were equals.
- I guess we're not equals.

777
01:03:19,396 --> 01:03:22,163
I was in a tough spot, Richie!

778
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:26,301
They see what happened here,
they're gonna shut me down!

779
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:29,785
That's it! Over!
You'd be out of a job.

780
01:03:29,886 --> 01:03:33,310
We all would.
The dream would be done.

781
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:37,812
That stupid... stupid girl.

782
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:42,486
The difference between 20 jobs and a
rock club that's been lodged on Ludlow

783
01:03:42,586 --> 01:03:45,923
since before Joey Ramone
was taking the 7 train!

784
01:03:46,023 --> 01:03:49,259
It's either that or the wrecking
ball wipes out this entire block

785
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:52,327
and replaces it all
with fucking condos!

786
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:57,268
Sorry.

787
01:03:57,768 --> 01:04:00,571
I'm under a lot of stress.

788
01:04:00,671 --> 01:04:03,071
This MSG will do it to you.

789
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:09,144
I'm not usually this direct.

790
01:04:10,913 --> 01:04:13,417
I've never been in a
situation like this before.

791
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:17,454
I'm not the best at handlin'
situations like this.

792
01:04:17,554 --> 01:04:20,355
I just wanted to let you
know where I'm coming from.

793
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:26,764
I like to talk about
other things. Your niece.

794
01:04:27,064 --> 01:04:28,730
World affairs.

795
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:34,169
These fuckin' ribs aren't
doing it for me today.

796
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:53,821
You're gonna have to eat
more than that, darlin'.

797
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:05,333
- No I shouldn't.
- You asked for it.

798
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:13,443
I just said that to get back
at someone. I didn't mean it.

799
01:05:13,543 --> 01:05:15,078
Come on. It's on me.

800
01:05:15,178 --> 01:05:19,348
You can't quit all at once.
You gotta wean yourself slow.

801
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:23,418
Well, this will make
you feel real good.

802
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:26,087
Trust me.

803
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,567
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

804
01:05:36,667 --> 01:05:41,102
Alright, well just make sure you bring
that cute little ass back here, okay?

805
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:44,174
I have a man now.

806
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:49,079
You got a boy, darlin'. You want a man?
You know where to find me.

807
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:52,280
You're a repulsive, pathetic old man.

808
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:48,906
We're finished here.

809
01:06:49,006 --> 01:06:50,941
Come on, finish that up. We gotta go.

810
01:06:51,041 --> 01:06:53,808
There's nothing good here.
Nothing good.

811
01:07:01,985 --> 01:07:05,887
- You alright, Richie?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

812
01:07:07,723 --> 01:07:10,959
- You gotta come to work tonight.
- No, not tonight.

813
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:19,803
You know the wonderful
thing about you, Richie?

814
01:07:19,903 --> 01:07:23,073
It's that death isn't just
a destination for you.

815
01:07:23,173 --> 01:07:27,377
It's a part of you. It lives in you.

816
01:07:27,477 --> 01:07:30,547
It's woven into the fabric
of your soul.

817
01:07:30,647 --> 01:07:32,849
There's nothing you could
do but embrace the fact

818
01:07:32,949 --> 01:07:36,384
that every day of your life
ought to be your last.

819
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,390
Let's go.

820
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:47,395
Let's go. Come on.

821
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:50,098
Come on. Come on.

822
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:46,523
Did you brush your
teeth and everything?

823
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:51,659
You brushed your teeth? Okay, good.

824
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:57,966
- You're not leaving me, are you?
- No, I'm gonna be in the next room.

825
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:01,035
Promise?

826
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:04,739
I promise.

827
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:12,983
Oh, I... I read your letter
when you weren't looking.

828
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:15,650
I was curious. I hope you don't mind.

829
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:21,122
It's a love letter, right?

830
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:25,126
Right?

831
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:35,072
You forgot to tell her you love her.
That's why it doesn't work.

832
01:09:35,172 --> 01:09:38,006
Why you keep rewriting it.

833
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:41,276
That's the word that's missing.

834
01:10:30,492 --> 01:10:32,894
We're gonna need you
to come with us, sir.

835
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:38,135
You wanna explain this to us
before we call the police?

836
01:10:38,235 --> 01:10:41,938
- I'd love to hear this one.
- I don't remember this at all.

837
01:10:42,038 --> 01:10:44,241
You don't remember this
happening a few hours ago?

838
01:10:44,341 --> 01:10:46,877
No, I do not. No, I do not, sir.

839
01:10:46,977 --> 01:10:49,012
At the time that this
incident took place

840
01:10:49,112 --> 01:10:51,781
I was under the influence
of a menopausal medication.

841
01:10:51,881 --> 01:10:53,817
I don't remember much of
anything that happened.

842
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:55,619
- Let's take a walk.
- Until a couple...

843
01:10:55,719 --> 01:10:57,320
Maybe you'll remember this.

844
01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:00,757
Listen, my niece is up there, okay?
You gotta let me back up.

845
01:11:00,857 --> 01:11:03,727
If we ever see you here again,
we'll call the police.

846
01:11:03,827 --> 01:11:07,964
- Please let me back up there.
- You have 2 minutes to get outta here.

847
01:11:08,064 --> 01:11:09,864
Come on. Come on!

848
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:53,385
<i>Dear Vista,</i>

849
01:11:53,486 --> 01:11:57,681
<i>I have stumbled upon a part of me that
wants to see the sun rise tomorrow.</i>

850
01:11:57,781 --> 01:12:02,619
<i>A part of me that has been buried
deep inside for so many years.</i>

851
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:04,988
<i>I wonder if it's better to
go through life thinking</i>

852
01:12:05,088 --> 01:12:08,825
<i>that a loved one who's missing could
still be alive out there somewhere.</i>

853
01:12:08,925 --> 01:12:11,895
<i>I'm guessing the answer
to that question is no.</i>

854
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:16,733
<i>But I've been asked to do a favor that
I don't feel like delivering any longer.</i>

855
01:12:17,133 --> 01:12:20,434
<i>It's a debt that I need
to settle before I go.</i>

856
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:39,990
Hey, hey, have you seen...
Gideon around?

857
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:42,559
Yeah, man, he's fucked up.

858
01:12:42,659 --> 01:12:44,461
Do you know where he is?

859
01:12:44,561 --> 01:12:48,196
- No, I haven't seen him in like an hour.
- Yeah, thanks.

860
01:14:19,289 --> 01:14:22,292
- Rich, Rich.
- He invited me here.

861
01:14:22,392 --> 01:14:24,258
He-he invited me.

862
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:28,331
Devin, it's important.
It's important.

863
01:15:22,118 --> 01:15:25,588
Richie! Hey, come here!
It's good to see you, man.

864
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:29,520
Hey, I'm real sorry about before.
I fucked up. I overreacted, okay?

865
01:15:29,621 --> 01:15:32,162
- You don't have to apologize.
- No, no, no. I fucked up. Okay?

866
01:15:32,262 --> 01:15:34,798
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- You don't have to be.

867
01:15:34,898 --> 01:15:36,900
Come on, let me get you a drink.

868
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,470
I've been thinking about it, man.
I've been thinking about a lot of things.

869
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:43,239
And I... I gotta stop
losing my temper, you know?

870
01:15:43,339 --> 01:15:46,576
I gotta approach things in a
positive and constructive way.

871
01:15:46,676 --> 01:15:49,379
Because when I think
about it, I was 18 years old

872
01:15:49,479 --> 01:15:51,247
when I first got into this business.

873
01:15:51,347 --> 01:15:55,084
I didn't know what the fuck I was doing,
but I had a positive attitude.

874
01:15:55,184 --> 01:15:57,720
I took this abandoned
warehouse dumbo.

875
01:15:57,820 --> 01:16:01,491
I turned it into the hottest party in
New York. I was cleaning 60 Gs a night.

876
01:16:01,591 --> 01:16:05,061
I was 18, on top of the world.
You know how I did that?

877
01:16:05,161 --> 01:16:08,295
You know how I did that?
I seized the moment.

878
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:12,199
I seized the moment.

879
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:17,707
Anyway, enough of that shit.

880
01:16:17,807 --> 01:16:20,009
Did you say your sister
was in jail earlier?

881
01:16:20,109 --> 01:16:24,481
- Or am I just making that shit up?
- It's not jail, it's called Central Booking.

882
01:16:24,581 --> 01:16:25,949
- She's in Central Booking.
- Yeah.

883
01:16:26,049 --> 01:16:27,217
It's on Center Street, right?

884
01:16:27,317 --> 01:16:29,452
- She gets out in a few hours.
- Good.

885
01:16:29,552 --> 01:16:31,654
I was thinking about
maybe picking her up.

886
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:35,058
- You should.
- I don't know what to say to her.

887
01:16:35,158 --> 01:16:37,627
- What do you mean?
- I don't know what to say.

888
01:16:37,727 --> 01:16:42,465
It's easy. You just tell her
you love her. That's it.

889
01:16:42,565 --> 01:16:45,268
Who else is gonna pick her up?
She got a husband?

890
01:16:45,368 --> 01:16:49,038
- She has an ex-douchebag.
- A douchebag?

891
01:16:49,138 --> 01:16:51,608
Ex-douchebag. He knocked
her up when she was 17.

892
01:16:51,708 --> 01:16:53,910
You gotta go there.
Here's what you gotta do.

893
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:55,745
You gotta go there and be supportive.

894
01:16:55,845 --> 01:16:57,113
- Right.
- She's your sister.

895
01:16:57,213 --> 01:17:01,784
She's had a rough night. I'm real glad
you came by to my little gathering

896
01:17:01,884 --> 01:17:05,088
- I didn't think you were gonna come.
- I'm not here for the gathering.

897
01:17:05,188 --> 01:17:08,658
I'm here to see you, to talk
to you about something.

898
01:17:08,858 --> 01:17:11,561
I think I know what you
wanna talk to me about.

899
01:17:11,661 --> 01:17:13,329
I don't think you do.

900
01:17:13,429 --> 01:17:17,500
People come to my gatherings not to
see me they come for other things.

901
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:21,738
No, that's not it. I'm not here for
other things. Gideon, I'm not...

902
01:17:21,838 --> 01:17:24,040
I got uppers, downers,
I got whatever you want.

903
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:26,609
You don't have to lie.
I don't give a fuck.

904
01:17:26,709 --> 01:17:29,612
No, listen, I don't lie.
I don't lie. Okay?

905
01:17:29,712 --> 01:17:30,880
Relax.

906
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:33,683
I don't lie. I want you
to know that about me.

907
01:17:33,783 --> 01:17:35,485
- Okay, okay. Okay.
- No, it's not okay.

908
01:17:35,585 --> 01:17:37,287
Because I was dishonest
with you before.

909
01:17:37,387 --> 01:17:41,624
I was dishonest with you.
It's been eating me up all day.

910
01:17:41,724 --> 01:17:46,329
And I try never to lie. I hurt someone
once by lying and it just, it...

911
01:17:46,429 --> 01:17:49,132
I wanted you to know
that about me. I don't lie.

912
01:17:49,232 --> 01:17:51,601
- Okay?
- Okay.

913
01:17:51,701 --> 01:17:54,404
It's important that you
know that about me.

914
01:17:54,504 --> 01:17:55,838
Alright. It's duly noted.

915
01:17:55,938 --> 01:17:59,409
Now that we've cleared that up,
I need you to do me a favor.

916
01:17:59,509 --> 01:18:01,878
- Alright?
- Alright.

917
01:18:01,978 --> 01:18:04,578
Ask me what I know
about your girlfriend.

918
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:11,621
- You fuckin' with me?
- No, I ain't fuckin' with you.

919
01:18:11,721 --> 01:18:14,424
I ain't fuckin' with nobody,
but I wasn't very truthful before.

920
01:18:14,524 --> 01:18:17,293
So if you wanna redo that thing,
you wanna go ahead

921
01:18:17,393 --> 01:18:19,596
and ask about her,
you go ahead and ask.

922
01:18:19,696 --> 01:18:20,897
- Okay.
- Okay?

923
01:18:20,997 --> 01:18:22,699
What do you know about my girlfriend?

924
01:18:22,799 --> 01:18:26,169
I know that she came into
The Devoe sometimes. I met her.

925
01:18:26,269 --> 01:18:29,238
I met her a few times.
She was a real sweet girl.

926
01:18:29,338 --> 01:18:32,339
- Yeah.
- But she's gone.

927
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:35,910
She's gone.

928
01:18:37,545 --> 01:18:41,215
- What do you mean she's gone?
- I mean she's dead.

929
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:47,657
She's dead. Do you
hear what I'm sayin'?

930
01:18:47,757 --> 01:18:50,293
Hold on. I don't know what
you're doing right now.

931
01:18:50,393 --> 01:18:52,629
Why you saying this?
Let me tell you something.

932
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:54,664
You're talking about
the love of my life.

933
01:18:54,764 --> 01:18:57,233
- I know. I know.
- If you are fucking with me...

934
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:59,302
- I'm not.
- If you are fucking with me...

935
01:18:59,402 --> 01:19:04,407
The love of your life died of a drug
overdose in the fourth bathroom stall

936
01:19:04,507 --> 01:19:06,709
of the ladies restroom
in The Devoe last night.

937
01:19:06,809 --> 01:19:09,445
- I was there. I found her.
- What? What?

938
01:19:09,545 --> 01:19:14,283
She's beautiful. She was beautiful
to you, and she was beautiful to me.

939
01:19:14,383 --> 01:19:18,054
But to Bill... I guess she
was bad for business.

940
01:19:18,154 --> 01:19:19,589
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

941
01:19:19,689 --> 01:19:21,124
- Where is she?
- I don't know!

942
01:19:21,224 --> 01:19:24,494
- Why are you doing this to me?
- I'm not doing it to you!

943
01:19:24,594 --> 01:19:27,697
- Why you telling me this?
- I'm sorry I lied to you.

944
01:19:27,797 --> 01:19:30,366
I'm sorry I lied.
I didn't know what to say.

945
01:19:30,466 --> 01:19:32,135
I didn't know what to do.

946
01:19:32,235 --> 01:19:34,303
Whatever you do to me, I forgive you.

947
01:19:34,403 --> 01:19:36,873
- I forgive you.
- Why are you doing this to me?

948
01:19:36,973 --> 01:19:38,975
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you telling me this?

949
01:19:39,075 --> 01:19:40,608
I forgive you. I forgive you.

950
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:23,483
Pull over.

951
01:20:41,937 --> 01:20:43,371
Get out.

952
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:51,812
Get the fuck out.

953
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:58,011
Your sister's fucking my husband.

954
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:08,389
What was your plan?

955
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:11,492
I don't know.

956
01:22:13,795 --> 01:22:16,763
Stab her in the eye
with a pen, maybe.

957
01:23:36,344 --> 01:23:38,180
I'm so sorry.

958
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:42,018
I'm never gonna leave you
like that ever again, okay?

959
01:23:42,118 --> 01:23:44,184
What happened to your eye?

960
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:51,126
Go back to bed for a couple
of hours before school, okay?

961
01:24:09,811 --> 01:24:11,545
Be right back.

962
01:24:31,699 --> 01:24:35,135
- I love you.
- I love you too.

963
01:25:02,197 --> 01:25:05,199
- Goodnight.
- Night.

964
01:25:16,545 --> 01:25:21,518
I can see it in her face.
She's changed since last night.

965
01:25:22,218 --> 01:25:24,551
You got her liking you now.

966
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,223
10 hours and suddenly
you're Mr. Wonderful.

967
01:25:27,323 --> 01:25:28,791
- Don't pay me.
- Take the money.

968
01:25:28,891 --> 01:25:30,593
- I don't need the money.
- Take it.

969
01:25:30,693 --> 01:25:32,993
I don't need the
money anymore, Maggie.

970
01:25:37,165 --> 01:25:40,333
This is just between us.
This whole thing. Okay?

971
01:25:43,238 --> 01:25:45,941
I'm gonna call out of work
for a couple of days.

972
01:25:46,041 --> 01:25:49,643
Just do it from home.
It's work. It's fine.

973
01:25:51,079 --> 01:25:53,616
You don't want anyone
seeing you like this.

974
01:25:53,716 --> 01:25:56,986
You called me because you don't want
your friends seeing you like this?

975
01:25:57,086 --> 01:26:00,222
I've a lot of people
depending on me. Unlike you.

976
01:26:00,322 --> 01:26:02,625
There's a lot of money
on the line of what I do.

977
01:26:02,725 --> 01:26:04,927
I walk into that office
with a black eye

978
01:26:05,027 --> 01:26:07,897
with any scent of emotional
baggage, it's done.

979
01:26:07,997 --> 01:26:10,399
Everything I worked for. Gone.

980
01:26:10,499 --> 01:26:12,501
We come from different worlds.

981
01:26:12,601 --> 01:26:15,504
I know exactly where we come from.

982
01:26:15,604 --> 01:26:18,441
And I know that we
used to be friends.

983
01:26:18,541 --> 01:26:20,607
We used to be close.

984
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:25,781
Well, we were young.
And we could make mistakes.

985
01:26:25,881 --> 01:26:28,551
Yeah, but I mean, don't you
miss anything, you know?

986
01:26:28,651 --> 01:26:32,321
- I miss what we had.
- Yeah, 'cause you got to be a teenager.

987
01:26:32,421 --> 01:26:36,892
You got to do stuff that other
teenagers do. I had a kid.

988
01:26:36,992 --> 01:26:41,163
I didn't have the luxury of hanging out
with friends from the neighborhood.

989
01:26:41,263 --> 01:26:44,431
I didn't have the privilege
of making bad choices.

990
01:26:48,336 --> 01:26:50,270
Look, this is just a...

991
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:54,610
This is just a onetime thing, Richie.

992
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:58,214
I don't want my daughter
having any more false idols.

993
01:26:58,614 --> 01:27:01,548
Okay? So, please...

994
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:04,084
if you can just...

995
01:27:05,953 --> 01:27:07,788
leave.

996
01:27:13,995 --> 01:27:17,163
4th grade, PS 164.

997
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:21,501
Scottie Evans and Jimmy Knight,
they got to me.

998
01:27:22,437 --> 01:27:25,605
Sometimes it was a black eye.
Sometimes they cut me.

999
01:27:27,408 --> 01:27:30,579
Then one day, you come down there.
You remember?

1000
01:27:30,679 --> 01:27:33,349
You put your fist up
real high... and boom

1001
01:27:33,449 --> 01:27:35,918
you punched Scottie Evans
on his chin he goes down

1002
01:27:36,018 --> 01:27:39,355
like a ton of bricks.
I never seen anything like it.

1003
01:27:39,955 --> 01:27:42,725
They said, "You embarrassed
that your little sister

1004
01:27:42,825 --> 01:27:45,725
fight your battles for you?"
I didn't think so.

1005
01:27:46,427 --> 01:27:49,732
Just seeing you
standing there, you know?

1006
01:27:49,832 --> 01:27:53,636
"You don't mess with Richie,
you don't mess with my brother."

1007
01:27:53,736 --> 01:27:55,802
I knew the truth.

1008
01:27:56,804 --> 01:28:00,607
I had the coolest
sister in the world.

1009
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:03,844
And then we...

1010
01:28:04,979 --> 01:28:07,016
we grow up.

1011
01:28:07,516 --> 01:28:09,315
We change.

1012
01:28:10,985 --> 01:28:13,052
I changed.

1013
01:28:15,323 --> 01:28:18,594
And you go and you have this...
this beautiful girl, Maggie

1014
01:28:18,694 --> 01:28:21,495
I mean, she's a one in a million.
She's so smart.

1015
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:29,936
I know you don't get to be like that unless
your mother is the best of the best.

1016
01:28:34,575 --> 01:28:37,177
And then I realized that...

1017
01:28:38,846 --> 01:28:41,781
some things never change.

1018
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:48,321
You're still the coolest
sister in the world.

1019
01:31:25,513 --> 01:31:27,216
Look.

1020
01:31:27,316 --> 01:31:29,952
Why don't you come over
for dinner on Friday.

1021
01:31:30,052 --> 01:31:33,219
Around 7? We'll talk.

1022
01:31:34,889 --> 01:31:39,426
But if you're late or you disappoint
Sophia I'm gonna kill you. Okay?

1023
01:31:43,664 --> 01:31:45,298
Okay.

1024
01:31:48,803 --> 01:31:50,337
Okay.
