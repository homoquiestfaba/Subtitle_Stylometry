00:02:06,357 --> 00:02:07,892
My friend N.J.
Once told me there are

4
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:10,561
seven defining
moments in a person's life.

5
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,216
The challenge is figuring out
which ones they are.

6
00:02:24,609 --> 00:02:25,943
You know, I know you.

7
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,114
I feel like I know you too.

8
00:02:33,452 --> 00:02:36,453
We're... connected
or something.

9
00:02:39,124 --> 00:02:41,041
Well, I know I know you, but...

10
00:02:42,293 --> 00:02:44,962
...But not from today.

11
00:02:47,131 --> 00:02:51,152
Mmm... not from now
and all this.

12
00:02:51,154 --> 00:02:52,469
Before today?

13
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,456
Five times.

14
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:56,707
Um...

15
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,311
You married?

16
00:03:01,313 --> 00:03:03,581
No, that's my mother.

17
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:05,933
Oh.

18
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,336
Why is the picture so old?

19
00:03:08,338 --> 00:03:12,306
She died when I was a... kid.

20
00:03:12,308 --> 00:03:14,692
People do that, I guess.
Dying, I mean.

21
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,527
My grandmother did.

22
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,513
Made the post, actually,
the way she died.

23
00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:21,164
She accidentally hung herself
opening her front door.

24
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:25,153
Wow, I remember that.
That... was your grandmother?

25
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:26,854
So she...?

26
00:03:26,856 --> 00:03:29,524
Yeah, she wore her keys on a
shoestring around her neck.

27
00:03:29,526 --> 00:03:30,992
Wow!

28
00:03:30,994 --> 00:03:33,077
Did you read all of these?

29
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,947
Is your last name, like, Barnes & Noble
or something?

30
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:39,083
Wait... five times. What do you
mean... we've met five times?

31
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,418
Five times.

32
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,087
Oh, I know this guy!

33
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,555
We studied him in school.

34
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,708
He's from, like, Britain
or England or somewhere.

35
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,210
You study Ruskin in school?

36
00:03:49,212 --> 00:03:50,761
Yes.

37
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:53,297
We study a lot of
different stuff, so...

38
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,133
Why not this guy, right?
I mean, he's famous.

39
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:58,302
He... liked little girls.

40
00:03:58,304 --> 00:03:59,570
I mean really little girls.

41
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,722
That's what my teacher
said, younger than me.

42
00:04:01,724 --> 00:04:04,025
He stopped loving them
when they started to grow.

43
00:04:04,027 --> 00:04:06,510
He died a virgin.

44
00:04:09,164 --> 00:04:11,282
Well, I didn't say
that he loved them

45
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,100
the same way
that you just did me.

46
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:18,105
You know...

47
00:04:18,107 --> 00:04:20,107
Some girls in my class shave.

48
00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:21,742
Do you think that
I should shave?

49
00:04:29,785 --> 00:04:32,687
What? You don't want me now?

50
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,339
It's just...
It's time for you to go.

51
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:38,075
Go? I don't have to go.
It's only four!

52
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:42,479
Ohh! What's with the map?

53
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:44,331
It's nearly six.

54
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,799
What were the five times?

55
00:04:45,801 --> 00:04:47,268
Whoops.

56
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,570
Stefani, you have to go.

57
00:04:53,808 --> 00:04:55,276
What are the pins for?

58
00:04:55,278 --> 00:04:58,479
They're all places I've gone.

59
00:04:58,481 --> 00:04:59,946
Really?

60
00:04:59,948 --> 00:05:03,317
You've been
to all those places?

61
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,768
No, not yet.

62
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,604
They're places I plan to go.

63
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:10,724
Oh.

64
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:13,627
Spain. Why Spain?

65
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:14,929
Homage to Catalonia.

66
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:19,467
Cata-who?

67
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:21,018
Catalonia.

68
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,936
It's, uh, George Orwell.

69
00:05:27,793 --> 00:05:29,543
And here?

70
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:33,864
Prince Edward Island.
Anne of Green Gables.

71
00:05:42,307 --> 00:05:44,174
Sheltering Sky, Paul Bowles.

72
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,133
You've really gotta go.

73
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,471
How 'bout you buy me cigarettes

74
00:05:57,473 --> 00:06:00,174
because I don't have any money.

75
00:06:00,176 --> 00:06:01,642
No.

76
00:06:01,644 --> 00:06:02,977
No cigarettes.

77
00:06:04,312 --> 00:06:05,780
Hey.

78
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,782
Mmm. Really, you gotta go.

79
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,184
Daddy's comin' home.

80
00:06:10,186 --> 00:06:11,903
Daddy?

81
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:13,154
Danny.

82
00:06:13,156 --> 00:06:15,940
My father's name is Danny,
he lives with me.

83
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,375
Does he tuck you in at night?

84
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,076
Shake your pee-pee
when you're done tinkling?

85
00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:22,512
You gotta go.

86
00:06:24,932 --> 00:06:26,867
I was just funning with you.

87
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:29,286
It's what couples do, you know?

88
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:31,756
They fun with each other.

89
00:06:42,851 --> 00:06:47,654
It was outside that comic
book shop, Forbidden Planet.

90
00:06:47,656 --> 00:06:49,106
What was?

91
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:50,740
First time I saw you.

92
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:53,978
When?

93
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,880
That one time
I was with my dad.

94
00:06:57,949 --> 00:06:59,283
Your dad?

95
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,818
Yep. You guys were, like,
best friends in high school.

96
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:09,560
Best friends... me and your dad?

97
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,795
Stephen Jouseski.

98
00:07:13,715 --> 00:07:14,998
Stephen Jousesk?

99
00:07:17,235 --> 00:07:19,837
Yeah. He yelled,
"hey, Twisted Bliss,"

100
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,722
and then you raced
into the store.

101
00:07:21,724 --> 00:07:26,227
Jetski? Your Jetski's daughter?

102
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:28,812
Well, his last name's Jouseski.

103
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:30,864
It's mine too. Also my mom's.

104
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:32,350
Buy me cigarettes.

105
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:34,185
He's your dad?

106
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,252
Cigarettes.

107
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:44,161
Jetski?

108
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:45,946
What's that for?

109
00:07:45,948 --> 00:07:47,665
Cigarettes.

110
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,333
Oh, I need you to
buy them for me.

111
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,502
I thought you said you were 18.

112
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,437
Well, I am, it's just
I don't have any I.D.,

113
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:57,208
and those Deli guys are
assholes about carding.

114
00:07:59,611 --> 00:08:01,779
It's time to go.

115
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,521
You know what I don't like?

116
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:11,588
Shoes, please.

117
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:17,861
I don't like the fact
that you're so old.

118
00:08:17,863 --> 00:08:20,031
It's gonna be kind of hard
having a boyfriend

119
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,499
who's so much older than me.

120
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,800
By the time I'm 21
and we can go to bars together,

121
00:08:23,802 --> 00:08:26,870
you'll be... I don't even know.

122
00:08:26,872 --> 00:08:28,906
But you'll still be
a lot older.

123
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,791
Boyfriend?!

124
00:08:32,962 --> 00:08:34,295
Is that daddy?

125
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:35,513
Danny.

126
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,681
And, yeah, that's why
you need to go.

127
00:08:42,103 --> 00:08:43,570
What?

128
00:08:43,572 --> 00:08:45,739
You afraid that daddy
won't be happy to see me?

129
00:08:46,941 --> 00:08:50,642
Danny, and, yeah, I'm mean....

130
00:08:51,514 --> 00:08:55,949
No. I don't think right now is
the best time to introduce you.

131
00:08:57,952 --> 00:09:01,021
- He's older.
- Oh, older. Older than you?

132
00:09:01,023 --> 00:09:03,023
Ooh. He's one of those
200-year-old guys

133
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:06,827
you've got to carry around and
bathe and feed and stuff?

134
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:08,796
Does he wear one of
those giant diapers?

135
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,498
Stephanie, really,
you've got to go.

136
00:09:14,002 --> 00:09:16,386
Wait! Are you coming with me?

137
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:18,889
Yeah? It's me. Let me in.

138
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,725
Listen, go to the Bodega around the
corner right here on First Avenue.

139
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,627
Mr. Charlie's
is the name of the place,

140
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,629
is the name of the guy
behind the counter,

141
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,297
and tell him
Mr. Charlie sent you,

142
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:29,299
and he'll sell you cigarettes.

143
00:09:29,301 --> 00:09:31,101
Wait. You want me
to tell Mr. Charlie

144
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,770
that Mr. Charlie sent me?

145
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,722
Charlie's, with an "s."

146
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:36,189
Time to go.

147
00:09:36,191 --> 00:09:38,759
Wait. No.

148
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:40,360
When am I gonna see you again?

149
00:09:40,362 --> 00:09:42,196
Because this weekend
is awful for me.

150
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:44,364
Um...

151
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:46,317
I don't know, maybe Monday?

152
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,919
Stromboli pizza, after school?

153
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,205
Okay. Don't play with me.

154
00:09:51,207 --> 00:09:53,774
And call me?

155
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:56,193
- Call me often.
- Okay. I will.

156
00:09:57,862 --> 00:09:59,213
Tell me you love me.

157
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:00,681
Stephanie, come on.

158
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,449
Tell me.

159
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:04,484
Okay. I love you.

160
00:10:06,154 --> 00:10:09,039
And you're sorry for...
being so crabby.

161
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,642
I'm sorry I was crabby.

162
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,427
Now, give me a kiss.

163
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:15,612
A real one.

164
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:17,448
Mmmm.

165
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,782
'Kay.

166
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,250
Better.

167
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:22,919
Ahh... oh! And I
left you a present!

168
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:24,388
A-a surprise.

169
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,956
Surprise? What is it?

170
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,341
Oh, can I keep the change?

171
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:29,343
Change? Yeah, sure. Keep it.

172
00:10:29,345 --> 00:10:32,646
- What... what's the surprise?
- Monday, stromboli pizza. Don't forget.

173
00:10:37,352 --> 00:10:38,635
Surprise?

174
00:11:10,935 --> 00:11:13,604
Hey, daddy, how was your day?

175
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,606
What the hell have you
been doing in here?

176
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,792
I buzzed and I buzzed you.

177
00:11:20,128 --> 00:11:21,461
I was in the bathroom.

178
00:11:30,622 --> 00:11:32,756
Now, what I'm smelling here...

179
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,924
I mean, you had
all day to do that,

180
00:11:34,926 --> 00:11:37,761
and you wait till
I'm coming home.

181
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:41,098
Well, if you hadn't
lost your keys. Again.

182
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,984
Besides, I had that interview.

183
00:11:43,986 --> 00:11:47,821
Yeah, so... When do you start?

184
00:11:47,823 --> 00:11:49,940
We're still working out
the details.

185
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:51,742
Soon, though, I hope.

186
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,861
Good. 'Cause I can't keep
giving you an allowance.

187
00:11:58,116 --> 00:12:00,450
Did you take care of
those things

188
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:02,453
that I asked you
to take care of?

189
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,154
Some.

190
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:08,508
Did you get the groceries?

191
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,710
Well, no.

192
00:12:10,845 --> 00:12:12,296
Mail the letters?

193
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:13,681
Not yet.

194
00:12:13,683 --> 00:12:16,783
Well, please tell me that you
got the keys made for me.

195
00:12:16,785 --> 00:12:18,769
At least tell me you did that.

196
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:20,854
It's on my to-do list.

197
00:12:20,856 --> 00:12:22,723
What the hell have you
been doing all day,

198
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:24,791
aside from stinking
the place up?

199
00:12:24,793 --> 00:12:26,293
I had the interview,
daddy, I told you.

200
00:12:35,853 --> 00:12:37,220
Mmm.

201
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:59,059
Well?

202
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:01,895
Right. Let me go
take care of that stuff.

203
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,354
What are you waiting for?

204
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:13,240
Well, the thing is, I kind of
spent the money you gave me.

205
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:15,442
"Kind of spent it"?

206
00:13:15,444 --> 00:13:16,910
I spent it.

207
00:13:16,912 --> 00:13:18,529
On what?

208
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:21,031
Well, I had the job interview,

209
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,117
and I spent it.

210
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:24,318
Hmm.

211
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:38,932
And the groceries?

212
00:13:51,812 --> 00:13:54,781
Okay, then. Uh, thanks daddy.

213
00:13:54,783 --> 00:13:56,700
Should have seen
what I just saw.

214
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:59,236
Yeah? What's this?

215
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,905
- Clear shot.
- Clear shot?

216
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:03,423
Standing at the top
of the stairs,

217
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,076
all sexy and smart-ass-ish.

218
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,243
Hm-hm.

219
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:10,914
Had a clear shot
of her womanhoodliness.

220
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,249
No panties.

221
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:15,285
She called me daddy.

222
00:14:17,172 --> 00:14:18,422
"Hello, daddy."

223
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:19,840
Wow.

224
00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:21,508
Wow is right.

225
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,977
Got a good smell of her
as she passed by.

226
00:14:23,979 --> 00:14:25,295
Wow.

227
00:14:27,765 --> 00:14:30,267
I'm gonna go take care of
those keys before they close.

228
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,534
Yeah, do that.

229
00:14:34,105 --> 00:14:36,106
Ah, Mr. Charlie's!

230
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:39,109
- Hello! Hello!
- Hey! Has a woman...?

231
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:40,444
No!

232
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:43,012
- I haven't even asked you...
- Ah, yes, I know.

233
00:14:44,298 --> 00:14:46,450
- Well, did she...?
-  No!

234
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:51,255
- When did she...?
- No, Mr. Charlie's. The girl. No problem.

235
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:54,424
I tell her come any time,
all the time.

236
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:59,195
A friend of Mr. Charlie's
is a friend of Mr. Charlie's.

237
00:14:59,197 --> 00:15:01,815
She's your daughter, yes?

238
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,817
Daughter? She's a...

239
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,552
No, she's not my daughter.

240
00:15:05,554 --> 00:15:08,672
Ohh. Understand.

241
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,941
Understand!

242
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,359
I'm sure you do.

243
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:14,394
Uh... never mind.

244
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:15,729
Mr. Charlie's no shop?

245
00:15:15,731 --> 00:15:17,948
Uh, no, not right now. Later.

246
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,165
Ah, yes, later, Mr. Charlie's.

247
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:36,983
That'll be $5.75, Morris.

248
00:17:08,642 --> 00:17:10,978
Right.

249
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,413
Thanks.
I can never find my key.

250
00:17:24,775 --> 00:17:27,327
Right. Trouble getting it in?

251
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:29,162
What?

252
00:17:29,164 --> 00:17:31,665
Happens a lot. Sometimes
just doesn't want to go in.

253
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:35,602
Oh, uh, no. It's new.

254
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:37,254
I usually don't have trouble.

255
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,005
Right. Well, maybe some lube.

256
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:41,474
- Excuse me?
- The lock.

257
00:17:43,444 --> 00:17:44,911
Right.

258
00:17:44,913 --> 00:17:46,746
Hey, is that a good magazine?

259
00:17:46,748 --> 00:17:49,049
Well, the makeup tips and
sex advice are all wrong,

260
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:51,517
but the hairstyles and how-to-lose-weight
articles are pretty good.

261
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:53,353
"Bananas cure everything

262
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:54,821
from PMS to menopause."

263
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,656
I didn't know that.
Did you know that?

264
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,325
No, I didn't. I was
actually talking about

265
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,793
the travel magazine, though.

266
00:18:00,795 --> 00:18:02,963
Oh. Oh, right.

267
00:18:02,965 --> 00:18:04,464
It's my husband's, George's.

268
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:06,466
He never reads it.

269
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:08,301
Oh, here, have it.

270
00:18:08,303 --> 00:18:09,802
I don't even know
why we get it.

271
00:18:09,804 --> 00:18:11,804
You travel much?

272
00:18:11,806 --> 00:18:13,974
Uh, yeah, I travel. A lot.

273
00:18:13,976 --> 00:18:16,476
Or... I plan to travel.

274
00:18:16,478 --> 00:18:18,144
I haven't been anywhere
yet. Soon, though.

275
00:18:18,146 --> 00:18:20,947
Right. What are you doing
Sunday at five P.M.?

276
00:18:20,949 --> 00:18:22,933
Nothing... I can think of.

277
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,401
Great. Um...

278
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,336
Uh, let me ask you,
do you, uh...

279
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:28,738
Do you eat that...
what's that stuff called?

280
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,407
- What stuff?
- That Mexican stuff.

281
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,743
- Tacos?
- No, no. Tomatoes and onions.

282
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:35,745
- Comes in a bottle. It's all chopped up.
- Salsa.

283
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,480
Yeah, right. Salsa.
You eat salsa?

284
00:18:37,482 --> 00:18:39,916
Not often...
But, yeah, I eat it.

285
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,384
Oh. Well, great.

286
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:44,271
You want to make 125 bucks?

287
00:18:44,273 --> 00:18:45,905
Mmm... what do I have to do?

288
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:47,774
Nothing!

289
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:49,242
Oh, well, next to nothing.

290
00:18:49,244 --> 00:18:51,944
I need you for a focus
group for a new salsa.

291
00:18:51,946 --> 00:18:54,947
You just have to look at some
print ads and make some comments.

292
00:18:54,949 --> 00:18:57,016
Sure, yeah, I could do that.

293
00:18:57,018 --> 00:18:58,485
Right, right.

294
00:18:58,487 --> 00:19:00,320
Um...

295
00:19:00,322 --> 00:19:01,621
Troy, right?

296
00:19:03,457 --> 00:19:04,991
Morris.

297
00:19:04,993 --> 00:19:07,277
Uh, Morris Bliss.

298
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,945
Bliss.

299
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,280
Right.

300
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:19,072
...With wings and feathers,

301
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:23,643
birds can travel almost
anywhere they want.

302
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:26,562
What drives them to migrate?

303
00:19:26,564 --> 00:19:28,732
Survival.

304
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:31,902
What guides their path?

305
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,571
Instinct.

306
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:38,675
Without their instincts,
they would be lost,

307
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,926
blown off course,

308
00:19:40,928 --> 00:19:42,912
but, fortunately,

309
00:19:42,914 --> 00:19:46,265
their instincts
are strong and...

310
00:21:19,777 --> 00:21:21,110
Mmmm.

311
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:36,543
Yep?

312
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,795
We need to talk.

313
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,263
Stephanie?

314
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:41,698
I'm outside.

315
00:21:47,988 --> 00:21:50,540
Geez. What, do you
sleep in your clothes?

316
00:21:51,591 --> 00:21:53,359
Yep. I do.

317
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,315
What's up?

318
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,483
Don't worry, I'm not pregnant.

319
00:22:04,272 --> 00:22:06,273
I realize things.

320
00:22:06,275 --> 00:22:08,775
Now that I'm 18,
I realize things.

321
00:22:08,777 --> 00:22:12,279
I realize that...
I like you a lot.

322
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:16,283
I really like this Morris and
Stephanie thing that we have,

323
00:22:16,285 --> 00:22:22,121
but I realize that this,
our you-and-me,

324
00:22:22,123 --> 00:22:24,424
is not gonna work out.

325
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,626
I have plans, you know?

326
00:22:26,628 --> 00:22:29,879
You just aren't part of 'em.

327
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,131
I'm not a part of your plans?

328
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,885
Nope.

329
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:37,053
What kind of plans
are you talking about?

330
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:40,757
Owning my own Subway
sandwich shop, for one.

331
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,458
Be... be serious.

332
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,943
I am being serious.

333
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,745
This boy in my class,
Flabby Robbie,

334
00:22:45,747 --> 00:22:48,448
his dad owns a Subway
on 23rd and 7th Avenue,

335
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,949
and it makes a ton of money.

336
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:53,019
He actually gets them delivered
to school for lunch.

337
00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:55,622
That's how he makes
friends... free sandwiches.

338
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,174
That's the only reason, actually,
why people like Robbie.

339
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:00,193
He's kind of sickening.
His hands are always sticky

340
00:23:00,195 --> 00:23:02,162
like he just sneezed
in them, or worse.

341
00:23:02,164 --> 00:23:03,329
Oh, Christ!

342
00:23:03,331 --> 00:23:05,098
What? A rat!

343
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,200
Is that a rat? Oh, my God!
I think that's a rat!

344
00:23:07,202 --> 00:23:09,703
- Where?
- Kill it, kill it, kill it!

345
00:23:09,705 --> 00:23:11,504
Stephanie, get off me!

346
00:23:11,506 --> 00:23:13,840
Oh, my God!

347
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:16,542
It ran down that way.
I saw it run.

348
00:23:16,544 --> 00:23:17,811
Oh, God.

349
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,278
I hate rats.

350
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,081
Worse than horny cousins,
you know...

351
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:23,449
- The way you've got to fight 'em off.
- Right.

352
00:23:23,451 --> 00:23:26,102
We had this rat once in
our apartment building.

353
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:27,903
Used to hang out
in front of the door.

354
00:23:27,905 --> 00:23:30,873
Used to look through the peephole
to make sure I wasn't watching.

355
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:33,860
It was like he smelled the frozen
pizzas that my dad was cooking up.

356
00:23:33,862 --> 00:23:35,729
The super wouldn't do
anything about it,

357
00:23:35,731 --> 00:23:39,482
so my dad, he had to put
out those sticky traps,

358
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:41,801
and then the other ones,
you know,

359
00:23:41,803 --> 00:23:43,302
the kinds that snap.

360
00:23:43,304 --> 00:23:46,239
But rats are smart. This one was
smart, because nothing worked.

361
00:23:46,241 --> 00:23:49,208
So, one day, the rat
is scratching at the door.

362
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,110
My dad got so angry
that he grabbed a mop

363
00:23:51,112 --> 00:23:52,845
and he went and he
killed it himself.

364
00:23:52,847 --> 00:23:54,914
He killed it with a mop?

365
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:56,866
Well, he tried to.

366
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:59,302
He was naked
except for his underwear,

367
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:03,156
and the rat was sitting there with
this "what do you want?" Look.

368
00:24:03,158 --> 00:24:05,091
My dad went and hit it
with the mop,

369
00:24:05,093 --> 00:24:06,643
but it was one of
those sponge mops,

370
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,661
so it didn't really
hurt the rat that much,

371
00:24:08,663 --> 00:24:11,330
and the rat went
running down the hallway.

372
00:24:11,332 --> 00:24:13,933
My dad chased after it,
and he...

373
00:24:13,935 --> 00:24:18,337
Gave it a good wallop,
you know, real hard.

374
00:24:18,339 --> 00:24:21,107
I guess the rat got
hooked on to the mop.

375
00:24:21,109 --> 00:24:24,511
The tail or something got
wrapped around the handle,

376
00:24:24,513 --> 00:24:27,113
and so, as my dad
yanked at the mop,

377
00:24:27,115 --> 00:24:32,418
the rat went flying up in the air,
doing flips and twists and...

378
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,789
I guess, for a split second,

379
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:37,723
for a tiny split second,

380
00:24:37,725 --> 00:24:40,442
that rat came
face level with my dad.

381
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:45,465
Came up right here.
Looked him dead in the eye.

382
00:24:45,467 --> 00:24:48,467
My dad says he's never
seen so much evil

383
00:24:48,469 --> 00:24:51,271
as he saw in that rat's eyes.

384
00:24:51,273 --> 00:24:54,106
And then the rat, like,
fell down the bannister

385
00:24:54,108 --> 00:24:58,194
and was hitting his head,
bang-bang-bang.

386
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:02,247
When my dad went to go
look, the rat was gone.

387
00:25:07,054 --> 00:25:08,604
Wow.

388
00:25:10,874 --> 00:25:15,127
I probably don't mean
that much to you, do I?

389
00:25:15,129 --> 00:25:17,797
Just... another girlfriend,

390
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:20,766
one of probably three
zillion that you've had.

391
00:25:20,768 --> 00:25:23,903
Three zillion's
on the high end.

392
00:25:23,905 --> 00:25:25,905
So...

393
00:25:25,907 --> 00:25:28,974
What other plans do you have?

394
00:25:28,976 --> 00:25:30,810
Oh, I have lots of plans.

395
00:25:30,812 --> 00:25:32,445
None that I fit in.

396
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:33,763
No.

397
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:38,367
It's just... You don't seem.

398
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:40,136
I don't seem what?

399
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:42,138
You know, you just don't seem.

400
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,606
What does that mean,
"I don't seem"?

401
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:45,642
Before I forget,

402
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,510
I got you something, a gift.

403
00:25:50,281 --> 00:25:52,115
You got me Brie?

404
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,917
No, it's cheese. French, I think.
It's expensive stuff.

405
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:57,520
Where'd you get it?
Mr. Charlie's.

406
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:59,204
You bought this
at Mr. Charlie's?

407
00:25:59,206 --> 00:26:02,041
Well, I didn't exactly buy it.

408
00:26:02,043 --> 00:26:03,460
You stole it?

409
00:26:03,462 --> 00:26:04,677
Yeah. But it was because

410
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:06,679
he didn't give me change for
that 20 that you gave me.

411
00:26:06,681 --> 00:26:08,681
He kept saying, "problems,
problems, no change."

412
00:26:08,683 --> 00:26:10,467
Mr. Charlie's never has change.

413
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:12,552
No change? Yeah, well,
I went in there, you know.

414
00:26:12,554 --> 00:26:14,386
I made up for it. I did
a little extra shopping.

415
00:26:14,388 --> 00:26:16,556
He knows who you are.
He knows I know you.

416
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:18,558
So? He stole from me first.

417
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,545
And besides, it's not like we're
gonna go back there again.

418
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,182
Okay?

419
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:28,150
Okay what?

420
00:26:28,152 --> 00:26:30,119
I don't know. Just okay.

421
00:26:32,005 --> 00:26:33,539
Give me a kiss.

422
00:26:33,541 --> 00:26:35,358
Sure, that fits
into your plans.

423
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,193
I don't want
to ruin your plans.

424
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:39,712
No, no, no. I'll make you fit.

425
00:26:56,446 --> 00:26:58,915
- Where you going?
- Guess what I'm thinking.

426
00:27:00,117 --> 00:27:02,018
What are you thinking?

427
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,521
I'm thinking... That...

428
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:06,255
Maybe my plans have changed.

429
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:09,091
I'm thinking that
maybe you're part of them.

430
00:27:09,093 --> 00:27:11,060
May 23rd.

431
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:12,695
What's may 23rd?

432
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:14,197
Prom. Monday, stromboli pizza.

433
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,599
After school. Don't forget.

434
00:27:21,354 --> 00:27:22,588
Who's the girl, man?

435
00:27:24,658 --> 00:27:27,209
Where you been all week?

436
00:27:29,246 --> 00:27:31,447
What's with the bad tux?
You gettin' married?

437
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:35,585
No, man. And that's a blessing.

438
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:36,936
A pure blessing.

439
00:27:38,105 --> 00:27:39,505
Buy me a beer?

440
00:27:41,425 --> 00:27:43,259
I been riskin'
my life all week.

441
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:44,310
One beer.

442
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,948
Mama's, man.

443
00:27:51,201 --> 00:27:52,535
Saved my life.

444
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:55,271
What the hell's a "Mama's"?

445
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,156
It's what saved me
from the Cindi.

446
00:27:57,158 --> 00:27:58,557
Saved you from the what?

447
00:28:01,561 --> 00:28:03,062
Help yourself.

448
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,301
It's all about economics, man.

449
00:28:09,303 --> 00:28:10,837
How people spend money.

450
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:12,404
What they spend it on.

451
00:28:12,406 --> 00:28:15,341
It's all about the way people
spend other people's money.

452
00:28:15,343 --> 00:28:17,076
The way I'm always
buying you a beer

453
00:28:17,078 --> 00:28:18,511
'cause you're always broke?

454
00:28:18,513 --> 00:28:20,580
I'm not broke, man,
just frugal.

455
00:28:20,582 --> 00:28:24,083
You keepin' a tab?

456
00:28:24,085 --> 00:28:26,085
Like Medusa in a mirror,

457
00:28:26,087 --> 00:28:29,288
the economics of Mama's
broke the curse of the Cindi.

458
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,607
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

459
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,092
Mama's is a buffet
up in Harlem.

460
00:28:33,094 --> 00:28:34,927
The Cindi was my fiancée.

461
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:36,428
Your fiancée?

462
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,064
Why do you think
I got the tux, man?

463
00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:39,616
I was getting married today.

464
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:41,183
You were getting married, and
you didn't even tell me?

465
00:28:41,185 --> 00:28:42,685
It all happened so quick, man.

466
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:44,153
You could have called.

467
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:46,789
You could have said, "Morris,
I'm getting married."

468
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,458
I've known the Cindi
since Sunday.

469
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,959
I met her at church.

470
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:51,961
Six days ago?

471
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:53,629
I like to think of it
as a week, man.

472
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:55,131
A week can be a long time.

473
00:28:56,433 --> 00:28:57,933
Rome was ravaged in less.

474
00:28:57,935 --> 00:29:01,137
The seven days' war changed the
landscape of the middle east.

475
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:02,605
Yeah. Lot of destruction.

476
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,624
It was the six days' war that
happened in the middle east.

477
00:29:04,626 --> 00:29:06,025
God created the world
in a week.

478
00:29:06,027 --> 00:29:07,527
What's important...
it didn't happen.

479
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:09,028
I was saved.
I didn't get married.

480
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,898
We had a 4:00 appointment with
the judge today to get married.

481
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,650
The hottest thing man.

482
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:16,252
Cindi and I,
really into each other,

483
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,588
like plaid on polyester,
morning, noon, night.

484
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,058
Her place is in Harlem,
so we go to Mama's for lunch,

485
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,526
a pre-wedding meal.

486
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,662
Mama's, best buffet
in the city,

487
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:27,163
$4.25 a pound buffet,

488
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,048
except chitlins, which cost more.
Great stuff.

489
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:31,751
So... at the buffet,

490
00:29:31,753 --> 00:29:33,753
she loads up on rice and beans.

491
00:29:33,755 --> 00:29:35,254
Rice and beans, nothing else.

492
00:29:35,256 --> 00:29:37,089
Not the ribs, not the greens,
not the pulled pork, nothing.

493
00:29:37,091 --> 00:29:38,891
Just the cheap,
heavy stuff, man.

494
00:29:38,893 --> 00:29:41,394
Her meal ended up
costing seven bucks,

495
00:29:41,396 --> 00:29:43,346
all for a plate
of rice and beans,

496
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:46,432
and I'm the one paying for it.

497
00:29:46,434 --> 00:29:48,768
'Bout to get married
in less than three hours,

498
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:52,438
and suddenly I saw it all.

499
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,275
Saw the true colors
of the Cindi.

500
00:29:56,277 --> 00:29:58,277
I broke it off then and there.

501
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:00,246
I mean, how could I marry a
woman who has no problem

502
00:30:00,248 --> 00:30:02,948
paying seven and change,
all for beans and rice?

503
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,603
Get two more?

504
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:09,605
So, uh...

505
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:13,075
Who's the 15-year-old girl I saw you with?
Is she stalking you?

506
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:15,611
Eighteen. Stalking? No.

507
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:16,795
Why?

508
00:30:16,797 --> 00:30:19,015
'Cause this turning
into a gift or a threat.

509
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,467
- Remember Jetski?
- Jetski?

510
00:30:21,469 --> 00:30:22,935
Guy from high school.

511
00:30:22,937 --> 00:30:24,620
- Kid with the harelip. Spit when he talked.
- No, no, no.

512
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:26,422
Oh, I know who you mean.
Yeah, Jetski.

513
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:28,324
The guy's an asshole.
He used to work at

514
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,827
the movie theater
on 12th street.

515
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,079
He tried to sell me popcorn
he swept off the floor.

516
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,580
The guy's a real asshole, man.

517
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,516
Well, that girl you saw
is Jetski's daughter.

518
00:30:36,518 --> 00:30:38,451
Your girlfriend
is Jetski's daughter?

519
00:30:38,453 --> 00:30:40,986
- She's not my girlfriend.
- Thank God for that.

520
00:30:40,988 --> 00:30:42,505
Why?

521
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,306
Because if she was, I'd have
to tell you to dump her, man.

522
00:30:44,308 --> 00:30:46,025
My advice would be
to dump her, quick.

523
00:30:54,934 --> 00:30:57,303
So, you're not dating her?

524
00:30:57,305 --> 00:30:59,305
- No, I'm not dating her.
- But you slept with her?

525
00:30:59,307 --> 00:31:00,772
Look, I just met her today.

526
00:31:00,774 --> 00:31:02,441
Yes or no, man,
did you sleep with her?

527
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,110
Yes, I slept with her, but
it's not like you're thinking.

528
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,512
- Really?
- Really. Listen.

529
00:31:06,514 --> 00:31:09,482
I was looking for
a present for daddy.

530
00:31:09,484 --> 00:31:10,733
Dad.

531
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,138
You have something
on your face.

532
00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:20,626
Other side.

533
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:26,582
Hey, have you listened
to these guys?

534
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:29,852
They rock, but I want to show
you something even better.

535
00:31:34,174 --> 00:31:35,774
She came on to you.

536
00:31:35,776 --> 00:31:37,210
Yeah, but just let me finish.

537
00:31:51,491 --> 00:31:52,959
Uh...

538
00:31:55,829 --> 00:31:58,831
I want to see your place.

539
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,299
I don't know you.

540
00:32:00,301 --> 00:32:03,152
My name's Stephanie. Stephanie!

541
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:05,254
But... I don't know
who you are.

542
00:32:06,489 --> 00:32:08,457
You don't like me?
Why don't you like me?

543
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:11,761
Oh, I like you, I like you,
I just don't know you.

544
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,229
I know you.

545
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:15,664
I know you, I know
you, I know you.

546
00:32:18,502 --> 00:32:20,285
Dump her, man.
Tell her it was a mistake,

547
00:32:20,287 --> 00:32:22,070
tell her it was an oversight.

548
00:32:22,072 --> 00:32:23,555
You make it sound
like it requires

549
00:32:23,557 --> 00:32:25,057
a congressional investigation.

550
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:26,409
Basically, man, you had sex.

551
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:28,144
Two fancy animals
doing what animals do.

552
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:29,879
An act of nature. I'd get out

553
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,647
before emotions get tangled.

554
00:32:33,449 --> 00:32:35,417
End it before it gets messy.

555
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,464
Morris?

556
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,467
Yeah, it's me, daddy.

557
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,819
No shit, it's you.

558
00:32:53,821 --> 00:32:55,154
Come here, Morris.

559
00:32:59,993 --> 00:33:02,561
What the hell are you
doing out so late?

560
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,246
I was out with N.J.

561
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:06,248
Did you buy the groceries,

562
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,800
or did you take
the money I gave you

563
00:33:08,802 --> 00:33:10,853
and spend it on
something useless again?

564
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:12,087
I'll get 'em.

565
00:33:12,089 --> 00:33:13,422
No, whoa, whoa, whoa.

566
00:33:23,934 --> 00:33:26,135
How old are you, Morris?

567
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:27,303
35.

568
00:33:28,371 --> 00:33:30,972
Know what I was doing
when I was 35?

569
00:33:32,609 --> 00:33:34,160
I had a son,

570
00:33:34,162 --> 00:33:36,211
a wife,

571
00:33:36,213 --> 00:33:39,782
an apartment of my own.

572
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:42,417
A job.

573
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:44,286
See what I'm saying?

574
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:46,004
Not really.

575
00:33:46,006 --> 00:33:48,124
I was living.

576
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:49,508
I understand, daddy.

577
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:52,060
Oh, no, I don't think you do.

578
00:33:52,062 --> 00:33:54,413
I made choices.

579
00:33:54,415 --> 00:33:57,750
Each and every step of the way,

580
00:33:57,752 --> 00:34:00,486
I made a choice.

581
00:34:00,488 --> 00:34:02,805
It wasn't made for me.

582
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,840
I make choices.

583
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:07,142
Hmm.

584
00:34:07,144 --> 00:34:10,179
I wonder what your mother would
think about your choices.

585
00:37:20,987 --> 00:37:22,388
Stephanie, listen.

586
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:24,573
It's...

587
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,041
Hi, Stephanie.

588
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:27,909
It's...

589
00:37:27,911 --> 00:37:30,912
Hey, Stephanie, it's me.

590
00:37:30,914 --> 00:37:33,615
This is ridiculous.

591
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,556
Hey, Stephanie!

592
00:37:41,558 --> 00:37:43,925
- Twisted Bliss!
- Ah! You missed me, huh?

593
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:44,926
Jetski, Jetski.

594
00:37:44,928 --> 00:37:46,996
I ought to wax
your tugboat, Bliss!

595
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,697
- I've missed you too.
- Jetski!

596
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:51,083
- What are you doing?
- Jetski?

597
00:37:51,085 --> 00:37:52,751
Sweet baby Judas, Bliss!

598
00:37:52,753 --> 00:37:55,421
No one calls me Jetski anymore.

599
00:37:55,423 --> 00:37:57,506
I ought to take you
down for that, man.

600
00:37:57,508 --> 00:37:59,241
You know I hate that nickname!

601
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:00,809
Shit!

602
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,812
Twisted Bliss!

603
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:04,413
How you doin', buddy?

604
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:06,065
Good.

605
00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:08,000
Yeah? This is a reunion, Bliss.

606
00:38:08,002 --> 00:38:10,035
This is great.

607
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:13,138
How... how you been?
How's things? Things good?

608
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,191
Yeah.

609
00:38:15,193 --> 00:38:17,076
Well, it's good seeing you.

610
00:38:17,078 --> 00:38:18,894
Oh, man, it's good
seeing you too, man.

611
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:21,780
You know... You know what?

612
00:38:21,782 --> 00:38:23,799
We should go out
for some beers sometime.

613
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,268
Or, better yet, maybe you could
come over and meet the family.

614
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:29,738
You'd love my daughter!

615
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:32,774
What... what are you doing here?

616
00:38:32,776 --> 00:38:35,911
Oh, man, this renovation...

617
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:37,996
my show.

618
00:38:37,998 --> 00:38:40,932
I'm the foreman, in charge
of this whole project,

619
00:38:40,934 --> 00:38:42,551
which is already screwed,

620
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:44,920
and we haven't
even begun, but...

621
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:49,308
that's life, I guess. You
make plans, and life happens.

622
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,576
But... you've got
to get it done, right?

623
00:38:51,578 --> 00:38:53,078
You've got to push through.

624
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,746
Right. You've got
to push through.

625
00:38:54,748 --> 00:38:57,733
Do you remember
the Bloody Eagle brigade?

626
00:38:57,735 --> 00:39:01,737
I tell my wife and daughter
that story all the time, man!

627
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,255
No, I don't.

628
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,173
Aw, come on, Bliss,
the Bloody Eagles!

629
00:39:07,495 --> 00:39:10,579
Remember? You and me,
all the hijinks?

630
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:13,515
You, Morris the Professor,
coming up with the plan.

631
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,385
Me, the Axe,
getting the job done.

632
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:18,720
Remember all the shit
we used to pull?

633
00:39:18,722 --> 00:39:22,141
Twisted Bliss and the
Bloody Eagle brigade.

634
00:39:22,143 --> 00:39:24,927
Man, we were
famous in high school!

635
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:26,061
Shit!

636
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:29,180
You remember the time
that we put the, uh,

637
00:39:29,182 --> 00:39:31,182
the black shoe polish
on the toilet seats

638
00:39:31,184 --> 00:39:32,651
in the girls' locker room,

639
00:39:32,653 --> 00:39:35,253
or when you, the Professor,

640
00:39:35,255 --> 00:39:37,789
superglued Mr. Arnold's
chair to his desk?

641
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:39,257
- You remember that?
- No.

642
00:39:39,259 --> 00:39:40,925
Aw, come on, Bliss.

643
00:39:40,927 --> 00:39:43,027
Actually, no,
I really... I don't.

644
00:39:43,029 --> 00:39:44,613
The Bliss!

645
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:46,481
And Stevie J.!
The Bloody Eagles!

646
00:39:48,752 --> 00:39:50,085
Remember?

647
00:39:51,471 --> 00:39:54,106
- Sure.
- Oh, I miss that, you know?

648
00:39:54,108 --> 00:39:57,609
All those times, you know?

649
00:39:57,611 --> 00:39:59,428
But...

650
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:02,114
Now's now, you know?

651
00:40:02,116 --> 00:40:04,116
So, I have a wife,
teenage daughter.

652
00:40:04,118 --> 00:40:05,583
Right.

653
00:40:05,585 --> 00:40:08,520
I make good money, but...

654
00:40:08,522 --> 00:40:10,555
What do you do? Where... where...
where are you working?

655
00:40:10,557 --> 00:40:13,024
I'm between jobs.

656
00:40:13,026 --> 00:40:14,893
Let's. Do. Brews.

657
00:40:14,895 --> 00:40:16,361
How 'bout tonight?

658
00:40:16,363 --> 00:40:18,197
Let's get some cocktails
and catch up...

659
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:20,499
- Tonight, bro!
- Tonight? Eh...

660
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,501
Thing is, I gotta
watch my cash right now.

661
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,254
Bliss! Why didn't you tell me?

662
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,721
I could have got you on here.

663
00:40:26,723 --> 00:40:28,623
You should have
talked to me last week.

664
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:30,292
You know what?

665
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:36,631
Tide over.

666
00:40:38,701 --> 00:40:41,136
Till you get goin' again.

667
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:43,338
- Oh, no, I can't take this.
- No, no, no, no.

668
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,307
Take that.

669
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,409
One Bloody Eagle to another.

670
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,001
So, you want to see
what this place looks like

671
00:40:56,003 --> 00:40:58,270
before we tear
the shit out of it?

672
00:40:59,338 --> 00:41:00,806
Sure.

673
00:41:00,808 --> 00:41:03,074
Bloody Eagle, baby! Yeah!

674
00:41:04,677 --> 00:41:06,511
Oh, yeah.

675
00:41:06,513 --> 00:41:09,013
I haven't been in here
in six months.

676
00:41:09,015 --> 00:41:11,283
Restrictions, permits,

677
00:41:11,285 --> 00:41:13,618
wife suing the husband
for cheating,

678
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,788
husband's suing the wife
for being ugly.

679
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:18,123
Man.

680
00:41:19,792 --> 00:41:23,261
Divorce.
I don't get it, you know?

681
00:41:23,263 --> 00:41:27,299
I mean, when you say you're gonna
do something, you do it, right?

682
00:41:27,301 --> 00:41:29,501
- You stick to it.
- Yeah, right.

683
00:41:29,503 --> 00:41:31,970
I mean, just... your word.

684
00:41:31,972 --> 00:41:34,306
- I don't understand these...
- Jesus.

685
00:41:34,308 --> 00:41:37,142
This is your one warning:

686
00:41:37,144 --> 00:41:38,710
Leave or suffer.

687
00:41:38,712 --> 00:41:40,145
Hey, who the hell are you?

688
00:41:40,147 --> 00:41:42,781
You guys can't be in here.
This place is off limits.

689
00:41:42,783 --> 00:41:44,783
We've been breached.

690
00:41:44,785 --> 00:41:46,285
Excuse me?

691
00:41:46,287 --> 00:41:47,786
Remember the Maine.

692
00:41:47,788 --> 00:41:50,071
It's the Alamo, dumb-ass!

693
00:41:50,073 --> 00:41:53,409
- Let's just crack some heads.
- Ignition!

694
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:56,862
Ow! Ahh! Mother of God!

695
00:41:56,864 --> 00:41:58,163
I'm out of here, Jetski!

696
00:41:58,165 --> 00:42:00,432
I hear you. Sweet baby Judas!

697
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:11,826
The place is gonna burn down.

698
00:42:11,828 --> 00:42:13,328
Oh, no, they won't be so lucky.

699
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,497
Burning to death would be a
blessing to those people.

700
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:17,699
Be the only way to
get rid of the smell.

701
00:42:18,768 --> 00:42:20,435
Ohh! You know what?

702
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:23,038
I'm calling the cops, get 'em
to crack down on this shit.

703
00:42:25,441 --> 00:42:26,775
Wait, Bliss.

704
00:42:28,111 --> 00:42:30,295
I have an idea.

705
00:42:42,008 --> 00:42:44,376
There's three kinds of trouble:

706
00:42:44,378 --> 00:42:45,794
There's regular trouble,
real trouble,

707
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:48,029
and then there's the
trouble that you're in.

708
00:42:48,031 --> 00:42:50,081
No, you listen. I'm
not talking to you,

709
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:51,533
but if I was talking to you,

710
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:54,102
I would tell you how ridiculous
you look in this picture!

711
00:42:56,222 --> 00:42:59,958
There is a reason muscle shirts
are called muscle shirts.

712
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,710
It's because you're supposed
to have muscles to wear them.

713
00:43:04,314 --> 00:43:06,815
My grandmother had
bigger arms than you.

714
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:08,200
Where did you get this?

715
00:43:08,202 --> 00:43:10,702
What do you mean,
where did I get it?

716
00:43:10,704 --> 00:43:12,454
It's my dad's.

717
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:15,940
You know... your old high
school buddy, remember?

718
00:43:15,942 --> 00:43:18,660
Oh, by the way, my
mom is just thrilled

719
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:20,045
that you're taking me to prom.

720
00:43:20,047 --> 00:43:23,832
You told her?
Of course I told her.

721
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:25,834
I mean, I didn't tell her
who, but, yes, I told her.

722
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:28,303
Prom is a big deal.
It's like... a wedding.

723
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:30,806
But she said I couldn't go.

724
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:32,874
Uh, well, that's unfortunate.

725
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:35,043
Not until I ask my dad.

726
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:37,012
Not really until they meet you.

727
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:38,981
Which is kind of funny,

728
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:43,051
being that you're friends
with my dad and all.

729
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:44,820
Do you like chicken?

730
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:46,654
That's all my mom
knows how to make.

731
00:43:46,656 --> 00:43:48,924
It might be better if you
just eat before you show up.

732
00:43:50,793 --> 00:43:52,727
Look, Stephanie,
we need to talk.

733
00:43:54,463 --> 00:43:56,281
Okay.

734
00:43:56,283 --> 00:43:58,716
Well, I was talking
to my friend N.J., and...

735
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:04,288
- And...?
- And he said I should...

736
00:44:06,876 --> 00:44:08,460
What?

737
00:44:08,462 --> 00:44:10,361
He said I should...

738
00:44:13,499 --> 00:44:15,934
That I should find out what color your
prom dress is gonna be so I could...

739
00:44:15,936 --> 00:44:17,135
pink.

740
00:44:17,137 --> 00:44:19,705
Pink. It's my favorite color.

741
00:44:19,707 --> 00:44:21,272
Pink.

742
00:44:21,274 --> 00:44:23,709
There's a lot of things
you've got to learn about me.

743
00:44:25,277 --> 00:44:27,212
One of 'em is that...

744
00:44:27,214 --> 00:44:30,148
I get really pissed off when you
don't answer my phone calls.

745
00:44:38,624 --> 00:44:40,325
I gotta go.

746
00:44:40,327 --> 00:44:41,559
Trip.

747
00:44:41,561 --> 00:44:45,130
Monday. Stromboli.
Don't forget.

748
00:44:45,132 --> 00:44:46,465
Right.

749
00:44:50,636 --> 00:44:52,170
Monday.

750
00:45:13,876 --> 00:45:15,359
Damn it, Morris!

751
00:45:30,225 --> 00:45:31,442
Whoa!

752
00:45:31,444 --> 00:45:33,778
Ohh! It's me, daddy.

753
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:37,281
Wah... I know it's
you, goddamn it.

754
00:45:37,283 --> 00:45:40,118
You scared me.
Where are you...?

755
00:45:43,372 --> 00:45:44,872
I don't want to know.

756
00:45:44,874 --> 00:45:47,092
I'm helping out a friend.

757
00:45:47,094 --> 00:45:48,309
Great.

758
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:54,516
Making a choice.

759
00:45:55,951 --> 00:45:58,019
Stay low, Professor.

760
00:45:58,021 --> 00:45:59,437
Keep your head down.

761
00:45:59,439 --> 00:46:03,191
- Stephen, where are you?
- It's the Axe. Call me the Axe.

762
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:07,228
- Axe?
- I'm over here.

763
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:08,697
- Where?
- Here.

764
00:46:13,836 --> 00:46:16,003
Get down, Professor.
We're covert, remember?

765
00:46:20,242 --> 00:46:22,076
Oh, God, I hate heights.

766
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,266
I'm having second thoughts
about this, Professor.

767
00:46:28,268 --> 00:46:30,835
Maybe I should have
called the cops.

768
00:46:30,837 --> 00:46:33,771
We can do this, Axe.

769
00:46:33,773 --> 00:46:35,707
We're the Battle Eagles,
remember?

770
00:46:36,759 --> 00:46:38,092
The Bloody Eagles.

771
00:46:42,448 --> 00:46:44,682
I'm freezing up, Professor.

772
00:46:44,684 --> 00:46:47,435
I don't know if I can
go through with this.

773
00:46:47,437 --> 00:46:50,072
You made a commitment. You've
got to follow through.

774
00:46:50,074 --> 00:46:51,639
Just find your inner strength,

775
00:46:51,641 --> 00:46:53,641
just like that time you
killed that rat with a mop.

776
00:46:53,643 --> 00:46:55,376
You didn't freeze up
then, did you?

777
00:46:55,378 --> 00:46:58,796
You followed through.

778
00:46:58,798 --> 00:47:02,350
I told you about that?
I told you about the rat?

779
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:03,685
Let's go over the plan again.

780
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:05,587
Wait. When did I
tell you about the rat?

781
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:07,889
Hey. We're the Bloody
Eagles, right?

782
00:47:09,908 --> 00:47:12,410
Right. Let's do this.

783
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:15,146
- Let's do it!
- Yeah!

784
00:47:15,148 --> 00:47:17,415
This is bullshit.
They're not coming!

785
00:47:19,068 --> 00:47:21,886
Yeah, we've been waiting here for
something like 12 hours straight.

786
00:47:21,888 --> 00:47:24,539
- I'm hungry.
- No, they're coming.

787
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:27,442
They're not coming.
They pussed out, the big...

788
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:30,745
What was that?

789
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:32,213
It's them.

790
00:47:32,215 --> 00:47:34,382
No cops sound like that.
That sound was like...

791
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:36,951
It sounds like revenge! Aahhh!

792
00:47:39,788 --> 00:47:42,023
Professor, I'm down.

793
00:47:49,316 --> 00:47:51,449
Unh!

794
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:56,003
Aah!

795
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:03,378
Remember the Alamo, assholes!

796
00:48:07,783 --> 00:48:11,870
Goddamn it, Professor!
We did it!

797
00:48:14,406 --> 00:48:17,308
Bloody Eagle, baby!
Taste our talons!

798
00:50:45,141 --> 00:50:47,575
My wife was the first
woman I had sex with.

799
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:52,947
Can you believe that,
Professor?

800
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,302
The first,
and probably the last.

801
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:05,009
She got pregnant that
first time we did it,

802
00:51:05,011 --> 00:51:08,046
middle of senior year.

803
00:51:08,048 --> 00:51:10,348
What are the odds of that?

804
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:12,350
When I'm lucky...

805
00:51:14,286 --> 00:51:16,221
It's always with bad luck.

806
00:51:22,277 --> 00:51:24,112
Oh, man.

807
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:26,047
You should see my daughter.

808
00:51:29,117 --> 00:51:31,085
She's a beauty, but...

809
00:51:33,121 --> 00:51:35,639
I just don't feel the same
about her anymore, you know?

810
00:51:35,641 --> 00:51:37,008
It's like...

811
00:51:39,461 --> 00:51:41,462
It's like she's
all grown up, you know?

812
00:51:41,464 --> 00:51:42,697
Right.

813
00:51:44,066 --> 00:51:47,218
Fathers and daughters.

814
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:50,205
It's not the same as
fathers and sons. It's...

815
00:51:55,861 --> 00:51:57,145
Fathers and sons.

816
00:52:03,485 --> 00:52:04,886
You ever...

817
00:52:07,005 --> 00:52:08,339
What?

818
00:52:11,276 --> 00:52:13,211
You ever felt that
you were waiting?

819
00:52:14,446 --> 00:52:15,846
Waiting?

820
00:52:16,999 --> 00:52:18,249
Waiting on what?

821
00:52:20,268 --> 00:52:23,954
I don't know. Just... something.
Anything.

822
00:52:27,793 --> 00:52:29,510
It's like at the end
of Moby Dick,

823
00:52:29,512 --> 00:52:31,779
when Ishmael is out there
in the middle of the ocean...

824
00:52:33,616 --> 00:52:35,550
with nothing. Just...

825
00:52:37,653 --> 00:52:40,154
waiting for something
to come along and save him.

826
00:52:43,475 --> 00:52:45,676
What the hell are you
talking about, Bliss?

827
00:52:47,312 --> 00:52:48,596
I don't know, man.

828
00:52:49,982 --> 00:52:51,316
Just talkin'.

829
00:52:54,537 --> 00:52:56,137
So what happens?

830
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:57,972
When?

831
00:52:59,325 --> 00:53:02,327
With this guy.

832
00:53:02,329 --> 00:53:04,913
The guy in the middle
of the ocean. I mean...

833
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:06,297
Is he saved?

834
00:53:06,299 --> 00:53:09,133
Yeah, he's saved.

835
00:53:09,135 --> 00:53:11,336
By his best friend's Coffin.

836
00:53:14,089 --> 00:53:15,423
Damn, Bliss.

837
00:53:20,095 --> 00:53:21,562
What's wrong with you?

838
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:28,286
You know what you
need, Professor?

839
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:30,405
- What?
- You need...

840
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:32,624
Some woman action.

841
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:35,192
You got a girlfriend,
Professor?

842
00:53:35,194 --> 00:53:36,744
You need a girlfriend.

843
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,034
I should get goin'.

844
00:53:43,036 --> 00:53:44,919
You hungry? You want
to have breakfast with me?

845
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:46,755
You want to grab some breakfast?
I'd like to have breakfast with you.

846
00:53:46,757 --> 00:53:48,456
I'd love to, but I can't.

847
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:50,775
It's Sunday morning.
What do you got?

848
00:53:52,578 --> 00:53:53,995
Church.

849
00:54:04,306 --> 00:54:05,873
Well, Stephen, it's been good.

850
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,208
Hey.

851
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:10,578
- It's Axe.
- Right.

852
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:14,748
And no, Professor,
it's been great, man.

853
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:16,083
It's been great!

854
00:54:19,754 --> 00:54:23,324
You don't think
that shit matters?

855
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:26,077
You've got a lot to learn
about this business.

856
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:29,580
Things don't happen
like you see on TV.

857
00:54:29,582 --> 00:54:31,432
Life isn't that pretty.

858
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:34,285
Shit happens, and then
you're pushing 40,

859
00:54:34,287 --> 00:54:36,587
some more shit happens,
and you're pushing 70,

860
00:54:36,589 --> 00:54:39,590
then some more shit happens
and you're dead!

861
00:54:39,592 --> 00:54:41,426
Most of this shit
is just shit...

862
00:54:41,428 --> 00:54:44,411
day-to-day bullshit that doesn't
add up to much of anything.

863
00:54:44,413 --> 00:54:46,347
- You think...?
- Forget it.

864
00:55:19,848 --> 00:55:22,350
Thank you all so much
for your comments.

865
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:25,019
- I'm sure that our time...
- Even talking about salsa gives me cramps.

866
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:26,638
Thank you.

867
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,523
I'm available any time you need
me for one of these things,

868
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:30,892
especially if we actually
get to eat some...

869
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:32,093
Thank you, Duly noted.

870
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:36,363
So, uh, Morris, um...
You gonna get some dinner?

871
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:40,068
Uh, no, I was just
gonna head home.

872
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:41,585
Oh. Good. Me too.

873
00:55:41,587 --> 00:55:43,705
We can share a cab, right?

874
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:44,973
Sure.

875
00:56:25,413 --> 00:56:27,648
There you go.
And keep the change.

876
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:30,251
I got it, I got it.

877
00:56:30,253 --> 00:56:31,585
Thanks.

878
00:56:33,922 --> 00:56:35,823
Uh, right, I was thinking,

879
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:37,424
uh, I don't want
to go home yet.

880
00:56:39,261 --> 00:56:41,095
- Well...
- Drink, right?

881
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:43,765
Uh, sure. There's a
place right down there.

882
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:44,966
Oh, right.

883
00:56:53,942 --> 00:56:55,809
Hey, I was wondering
if you could help me.

884
00:57:01,317 --> 00:57:04,552
You see, my friend Morris,

885
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:06,487
he lives in the building.

886
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:10,425
Your friend?

887
00:57:11,576 --> 00:57:14,379
Yeah, my friend.

888
00:57:14,381 --> 00:57:17,181
Cheers. Thanks
for the focus group.

889
00:57:27,075 --> 00:57:29,743
Tell me something interesting,

890
00:57:29,745 --> 00:57:31,812
something about yourself
that few people know.

891
00:57:31,814 --> 00:57:35,099
Well... I'm half Greek.

892
00:57:35,101 --> 00:57:38,386
Mmm. I knew there was
a reason I liked you.

893
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:41,388
Mediterranean men know how
to handle women right.

894
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:44,425
You have a way with women.

895
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:46,944
Tell me something else.
Tell me a story.

896
00:57:46,946 --> 00:57:48,762
Tell me about
your first concert.

897
00:57:48,764 --> 00:57:52,433
My first concert? My first
concert was Liberace.

898
00:57:53,568 --> 00:57:55,036
Right, right.

899
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:56,403
No, really.

900
00:57:56,405 --> 00:57:59,106
Really. Liberace, Bob
Hope, and Bruce Jenner,

901
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:00,942
all on one stage, one night.

902
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:03,861
Bruce Jenner... you mean the
guy from the wheaties box?

903
00:58:03,863 --> 00:58:05,195
The olympian. Him.

904
00:58:07,632 --> 00:58:09,467
You almost had me!

905
00:58:09,469 --> 00:58:10,934
I thought you were serious!

906
00:58:10,936 --> 00:58:13,737
I am serious. My mother took me.
I was 12.

907
00:58:13,739 --> 00:58:15,739
I was too young to appreciate
the oddness of the whole thing.

908
00:58:15,741 --> 00:58:17,408
I had no idea
who these people were

909
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:20,161
or what it was
we were about to see.

910
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,447
That, and I was angry
with my mother then.

911
00:58:22,449 --> 00:58:25,666
Oh, I can't think of a time I
wasn't angry with my mother, right?

912
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,568
And she died, right?

913
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:29,636
Now I don't know
who to be angry with.

914
00:58:29,638 --> 00:58:30,955
How'd she die?

915
00:58:32,157 --> 00:58:35,092
How does anyone die?
Something stops.

916
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:37,327
Something doesn't stop.
Cancer. A car wreck.

917
00:58:37,329 --> 00:58:38,762
Coronary.

918
00:58:38,764 --> 00:58:40,081
But it's all good, right?

919
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:41,748
I'm not saying things are bad.
I'm not complaining.

920
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:44,852
I just... wish things
could be clean and clear,

921
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:46,203
with smooth edges.

922
00:58:49,475 --> 00:58:52,794
Right. Why can't I just bolt off
witty lines when I need to?

923
00:58:53,929 --> 00:58:55,680
No, you speak well.

924
00:58:55,682 --> 00:58:56,814
Mmm.

925
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,801
I speak well.

926
00:58:59,803 --> 00:59:02,069
Right.

927
00:59:03,271 --> 00:59:06,107
But tell me something:

928
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:10,043
Something you like about me.

929
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:13,581
I like your, uh...

930
00:59:16,985 --> 00:59:18,219
Dress.

931
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:22,756
And I like you, right?

932
00:59:24,309 --> 00:59:25,642
I like you a lot.

933
00:59:37,806 --> 00:59:40,474
Me and Georgie had a terrible,
terrible fight last night.

934
00:59:41,542 --> 00:59:43,377
I stormed out of
the house, right?

935
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:45,562
I stayed with my friend who
lives on 88th and Lexington

936
00:59:45,564 --> 00:59:48,132
in this tiny little place
she claims is a one-bedroom

937
00:59:48,134 --> 00:59:50,467
but really is just
a glorified studio

938
00:59:50,469 --> 00:59:52,586
with a Pullman kitchen.

939
00:59:52,588 --> 00:59:54,271
I'm sorry.

940
00:59:55,257 --> 00:59:56,923
You know what
frightens me the most?

941
01:00:00,111 --> 01:00:01,445
Not being appreciated.

942
01:00:04,616 --> 01:00:07,251
At home, I don't
feel appreciated, right?

943
01:00:09,721 --> 01:00:10,988
That, and turning shabby.

944
01:00:13,108 --> 01:00:14,708
I don't want to be
like a couch.

945
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:18,479
I don't want to get worn
and run down and lumpy.

946
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:21,999
I don't want to wake up one
day and realize I look used.

947
01:00:24,987 --> 01:00:27,137
You know what happens
to shabby couches, right?

948
01:00:27,139 --> 01:00:31,225
You... you've seen them,
right, on the street?

949
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:32,442
They get junked.

950
01:00:39,484 --> 01:00:41,985
We shouldn't be doing
this right here.

951
01:00:41,987 --> 01:00:44,154
- I want to see your place!
- Nah, daddy's home!

952
01:00:44,156 --> 01:00:45,623
Daddy?!

953
01:00:45,625 --> 01:00:48,125
I mean, Danny,
my father. He's home.

954
01:00:48,127 --> 01:00:50,628
Oh. Kinky. I like it.

955
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:53,163
It's just... mmm...
He's not well, so...

956
01:00:53,165 --> 01:00:54,632
Oh, right.

957
01:00:54,634 --> 01:00:57,485
Oh, that's so sweet of you,
taking care of him.

958
01:00:59,004 --> 01:01:01,338
Is he medicated?

959
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:04,408
- Yeah, he is.
- Maybe he won't notice!

960
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:05,910
No, it's just, um...

961
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:07,744
I... it's really tempting.
I just...

962
01:01:07,746 --> 01:01:10,080
Oh, wait. Shh, shh, shh.

963
01:01:10,082 --> 01:01:14,235
I think it's George. I swear
he's got a GPS on me.

964
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:15,853
Maybe you should go.

965
01:01:15,855 --> 01:01:17,104
Mnh!

966
01:01:18,606 --> 01:01:19,940
Right.

967
01:01:23,128 --> 01:01:25,129
Hey, I hope
your dad gets better.

968
01:01:25,131 --> 01:01:26,463
Yeah, thanks!

969
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:34,672
- N.J.?
- I found it, man.

970
01:01:34,674 --> 01:01:36,674
- Found what?
- The woman.

971
01:01:36,676 --> 01:01:39,342
The one. My life, man.
The reason to go on.

972
01:01:39,344 --> 01:01:41,478
Two days ago, you were getting married.
What happened to that woman?

973
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,647
That was years ago, man. Two
things happened since then,

974
01:01:43,649 --> 01:01:46,984
two important things, but I
gotta get running. I gotta go.

975
01:01:46,986 --> 01:01:49,452
I gotta get packed. Packed?
Where are you going?

976
01:01:50,588 --> 01:01:52,156
Montana, man.

977
01:01:52,158 --> 01:01:53,958
Montana? What's in Montana?

978
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,926
Me, and the one. The woman.

979
01:01:55,928 --> 01:01:58,946
To think, she's... she's been in
your building this whole time.

980
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:02,499
- Who lived in my building?
- My Bliss, Bliss.

981
01:02:02,501 --> 01:02:04,668
Hattie.

982
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:05,936
Hattie Rockworth.

983
01:02:07,706 --> 01:02:09,373
Hattie Rockworth?

984
01:02:19,517 --> 01:02:21,118
Morris.

985
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,719
Morris, come on in here.

986
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,362
Found these in the bathroom.

987
01:02:31,364 --> 01:02:33,948
Know they're not mine.

988
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:35,866
You don't wear these, do you?

989
01:02:35,868 --> 01:02:37,735
Surprise.

990
01:02:37,737 --> 01:02:40,420
Please tell me
you don't wear these.

991
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:44,525
Nope, they're not mine.

992
01:02:46,477 --> 01:02:50,130
I'm not running a hot-sheet
hotel here, you know.

993
01:02:50,132 --> 01:02:52,783
This is not where my
money's been going, is it?

994
01:04:23,592 --> 01:04:25,559
She's not coming.

995
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:27,061
Jesus!

996
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:28,529
Who's not coming?

997
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:31,282
Shit! Yeah, right, who.

998
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:32,566
Stephanie.

999
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:34,284
Sorry about the coffee.

1000
01:04:34,286 --> 01:04:37,271
Look, she's not coming.
She told me to tell you that,

1001
01:04:37,273 --> 01:04:39,990
and to meet her tonight out front
of the Velvet Cigar Lounge,

1002
01:04:39,992 --> 01:04:41,742
7:00, okay?

1003
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:45,078
And she said you'd buy me a
pepperoni slice and a root beer.

1004
01:04:46,081 --> 01:04:47,681
I'm not buying you anything.

1005
01:04:49,801 --> 01:04:53,304
Personally, I think you
two are perfect together.

1006
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:54,989
You're both really gross!

1007
01:05:10,638 --> 01:05:13,407
What's up with the outfit,
you join the rodeo?

1008
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:14,741
When in Rome...

1009
01:05:16,411 --> 01:05:17,928
What's that supposed to mean?

1010
01:05:17,930 --> 01:05:19,763
Montana, man.

1011
01:05:19,765 --> 01:05:21,332
It's what they wear in Montana.

1012
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:24,268
It's what I'll be
wearing when I herd.

1013
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:25,936
Herd what?

1014
01:05:25,938 --> 01:05:27,538
Buffali.

1015
01:05:35,763 --> 01:05:37,897
Check this out.

1016
01:05:37,899 --> 01:05:39,867
Hattie gave it to me.

1017
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:41,452
Is it a tapeworm?

1018
01:05:41,454 --> 01:05:42,820
It's a Red Thread.

1019
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:48,575
I'm in the cartel. I'm in.

1020
01:05:50,111 --> 01:05:52,946
Come on. I want
to show you something.

1021
01:05:52,948 --> 01:05:54,348
Come on!

1022
01:05:57,785 --> 01:05:59,202
See?

1023
01:06:00,138 --> 01:06:02,306
So... what you're telling me

1024
01:06:02,308 --> 01:06:04,141
is there's a secret cartel...

1025
01:06:04,143 --> 01:06:06,143
Yeah, the Red Thread.

1026
01:06:06,145 --> 01:06:08,562
...that controls the
world's energy resources

1027
01:06:08,564 --> 01:06:10,847
and runs an international
sex trade...

1028
01:06:10,849 --> 01:06:13,683
- And this Maddie woman...
- Hattie.

1029
01:06:13,685 --> 01:06:16,420
...Hattie, who you met yesterday
while waiting for me,

1030
01:06:16,422 --> 01:06:17,988
is now the new love
of your life,

1031
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:19,990
who you're running
away to Montana with,

1032
01:06:19,992 --> 01:06:21,491
introduced you to her father,

1033
01:06:21,493 --> 01:06:24,728
who runs the North American chapter
of the cartel, the Red Thread.

1034
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:26,563
Yeah. That's him.

1035
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:28,732
He's sponsoring you to become
a full-fledged member,

1036
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:30,851
which merely entails you
initiating a coup

1037
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:32,353
in some third-world country.

1038
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:35,088
Yeah.

1039
01:06:35,090 --> 01:06:37,591
That's okay. It took me a few
minutes to digest it all too.

1040
01:06:37,593 --> 01:06:39,059
But look at this.

1041
01:06:39,061 --> 01:06:40,611
Yeah?

1042
01:06:40,613 --> 01:06:42,279
Here. Look from here.

1043
01:06:43,781 --> 01:06:46,150
- And I'm looking at...?
- Right over here.

1044
01:06:50,372 --> 01:06:52,472
"Sex street, tail market."

1045
01:06:53,774 --> 01:06:56,443
The highest-grossing sex
trade market in the states,

1046
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:58,194
but we're getting
raided tonight,

1047
01:06:58,196 --> 01:07:00,497
so we have to move operations.

1048
01:07:01,616 --> 01:07:04,451
I gotta go. I wish you...

1049
01:07:04,453 --> 01:07:05,686
Luck with it.

1050
01:07:07,305 --> 01:07:08,605
You don't believe me, do you?

1051
01:07:10,958 --> 01:07:13,660
What? Of course I believe you.

1052
01:07:16,481 --> 01:07:21,251
Yeah, just like I believe you
went to Cuba last summer,

1053
01:07:21,253 --> 01:07:23,086
or that Nigerian
terrorist training camp

1054
01:07:23,088 --> 01:07:24,989
you visited
two christmases ago,

1055
01:07:24,991 --> 01:07:28,091
or the time Bill Gates called
you to ask your opinion

1056
01:07:28,093 --> 01:07:30,594
on one of his products.
Of course, I believe you.

1057
01:07:30,596 --> 01:07:33,030
Wait a minute, maybe I'm
being a little sensitive,

1058
01:07:33,032 --> 01:07:36,617
but I think I'm detecting
some harshness in your tone.

1059
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:38,602
- Really?
- Yeah.

1060
01:07:38,604 --> 01:07:40,270
No.

1061
01:07:42,257 --> 01:07:45,425
N.J., I love
to hear your stories.

1062
01:07:45,427 --> 01:07:46,760
It's fascinating.

1063
01:07:48,763 --> 01:07:50,764
It's hard to believe that
one guy could be so lucky

1064
01:07:50,766 --> 01:07:53,166
to meet so many famous
people, travel the world,

1065
01:07:53,168 --> 01:07:55,970
without ever leaving
the East Village.

1066
01:07:55,972 --> 01:07:58,272
Oh, what about your little map,

1067
01:07:58,274 --> 01:07:59,773
all the places you plan to go.

1068
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:02,009
'Least I've done
something, man.

1069
01:08:03,011 --> 01:08:04,644
Yeah, lied.

1070
01:08:09,967 --> 01:08:11,467
You remember how we met?

1071
01:08:13,354 --> 01:08:16,039
I saved your life, man.

1072
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:18,041
That day in the pool,
you were a rock

1073
01:08:18,043 --> 01:08:20,177
and I was Mark Spitz.

1074
01:08:21,913 --> 01:08:23,146
I pulled you up, man!

1075
01:08:33,474 --> 01:08:35,476
Shit!

1076
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:37,978
Morrie, old buddy,
what are you doing here?

1077
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:39,680
You smoke cigars?

1078
01:08:39,682 --> 01:08:43,050
Oh, no. I'm just
waiting for... someone.

1079
01:08:43,052 --> 01:08:44,485
It's nice seeing you.

1080
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:47,220
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Where are you going?

1081
01:08:47,222 --> 01:08:50,256
Bloody, Eagles, baby.
We need to have that drink.

1082
01:08:50,258 --> 01:08:52,593
Yeah, I'd love to, but
I'm waiting for someone.

1083
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:55,929
Oh, yeah? Waiting on a girl?

1084
01:08:55,931 --> 01:08:57,397
Yeah, a girl.

1085
01:08:57,399 --> 01:09:00,567
Yeah, is she, like,
super fly, super hot?

1086
01:09:00,569 --> 01:09:02,369
Yeah! Look,
I've got to take off.

1087
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:03,804
Surprise!

1088
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,772
Andrea.
What are you doing here?

1089
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:07,207
Stalking you.

1090
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:09,176
- Really?
- Bliss!

1091
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:11,344
Where's your manners?
Who's this pretty little filly?

1092
01:09:11,346 --> 01:09:13,681
So, after last night,
after our drinks

1093
01:09:13,683 --> 01:09:17,251
and all that...
Talking... we did,

1094
01:09:17,253 --> 01:09:19,269
what you said
really sank in, right?

1095
01:09:19,271 --> 01:09:21,772
- What'd I say?
- Right, like you've forgotten?

1096
01:09:21,774 --> 01:09:24,608
No, really. It really
cut me to my soul,

1097
01:09:24,610 --> 01:09:27,144
so this morning I woke up and
thought, "you know, Andrea",

1098
01:09:27,146 --> 01:09:28,946
time for something new."

1099
01:09:28,948 --> 01:09:32,566
An adventure, right?

1100
01:09:32,568 --> 01:09:35,035
Sounds like the Professor's
finally gotten tenure.

1101
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:36,736
Uh, I'm the Axe.

1102
01:09:36,738 --> 01:09:38,739
I'm sure the Professor's
told you all about me.

1103
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:40,540
So, I'd love to do
some more talking,

1104
01:09:40,542 --> 01:09:42,776
but George gets really jealous.

1105
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:45,428
- George is here?
- Yeah, he's just getting our coffee.

1106
01:09:45,430 --> 01:09:47,430
George, over here!

1107
01:09:47,432 --> 01:09:50,167
I bought him that
shirt as a joke,

1108
01:09:50,169 --> 01:09:52,252
but he loves it.
He wears it all the time.

1109
01:09:52,254 --> 01:09:54,254
Ha ha ha!

1110
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:56,807
- George, you remember Morris, right?
- No.

1111
01:09:56,809 --> 01:09:58,592
Yes, you do. I had drinks
with him last night.

1112
01:09:58,594 --> 01:10:01,144
That's why I came home so late.

1113
01:10:01,146 --> 01:10:03,680
- George was upset about that.
- This is the guy.

1114
01:10:03,682 --> 01:10:06,567
Yep. This is my little Bliss.

1115
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:08,435
His father's real sick.

1116
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:10,603
Professor! Your dad's sick?

1117
01:10:10,605 --> 01:10:12,522
- You didn't tell me that.
- This is the guy.

1118
01:10:12,524 --> 01:10:16,110
Georgie, we talked about this.

1119
01:10:16,112 --> 01:10:19,246
Um, so, uh, drinks again,
right, and more talk.

1120
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:21,198
Drinks. Right.

1121
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:23,533
And talk.

1122
01:10:23,535 --> 01:10:26,969
Don't forget the talk.

1123
01:10:26,971 --> 01:10:28,956
Talk. Right.

1124
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:31,258
All right, we've got to run.
Say goodbye, Georgie.

1125
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:32,626
You're the guy.

1126
01:10:36,297 --> 01:10:40,033
Mnh! Bloody Eagle, baby!

1127
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:41,451
Heh heh heh!

1128
01:10:41,453 --> 01:10:43,786
Bet you gave her a taste
of your talon, huh?

1129
01:10:43,788 --> 01:10:44,954
Yeah.

1130
01:10:44,956 --> 01:10:46,523
But be careful with
that one, Professor.

1131
01:10:46,525 --> 01:10:48,025
I know you're flying
high right now,

1132
01:10:48,027 --> 01:10:49,659
but little Georgie,

1133
01:10:49,661 --> 01:10:51,161
he looks like he could
clip some wings.

1134
01:10:51,163 --> 01:10:54,448
- You know what I'm saying?
- Hello, daddy.

1135
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:55,798
What were you guys looking at?

1136
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:00,170
Um, Stephanie, um, you remember
my good friend Morris.

1137
01:11:00,172 --> 01:11:01,238
The Professor.

1138
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:03,657
The Professor.

1139
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:05,559
You teach. I'm having some
trouble in my classes.

1140
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:07,544
Maybe you could tutor me.

1141
01:11:07,546 --> 01:11:09,163
You're having trouble in your classes?
Why didn't you tell me, sweetie?

1142
01:11:09,165 --> 01:11:11,381
You didn't ask.
What do you teach, Professor?

1143
01:11:11,383 --> 01:11:13,634
I'm not really a Professor.

1144
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:15,251
What are you, then?

1145
01:11:15,253 --> 01:11:16,753
He's a Bloody Eagle, Stephanie.

1146
01:11:16,755 --> 01:11:18,755
I told you all
about him, remember?

1147
01:11:18,757 --> 01:11:20,590
I might need a reminder.

1148
01:11:20,592 --> 01:11:22,759
We had this gang
in high school.

1149
01:11:22,761 --> 01:11:24,510
Oh, right, I remember. You were
best friends in high school.

1150
01:11:24,512 --> 01:11:26,162
You did everything
together, everything.

1151
01:11:26,164 --> 01:11:28,732
Who is that woman
that you were talking to?

1152
01:11:28,734 --> 01:11:30,484
- Nobody.
- Nobody.

1153
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:32,168
Nobody.

1154
01:11:32,170 --> 01:11:33,954
She didn't seem
like she was a nobody.

1155
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:36,657
She seemed like she was
probably a somebody.

1156
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:39,660
Sweetie, here. Why don't
you take a few dollars

1157
01:11:39,662 --> 01:11:43,413
and go get yourself and your
friends some ice cream,

1158
01:11:43,415 --> 01:11:46,182
okay, sweetie?
'Cause the Professor and I,

1159
01:11:46,184 --> 01:11:48,985
we have some business
we need to talk about, okay?

1160
01:11:48,987 --> 01:11:50,353
Does mom know
you've been drinking?

1161
01:11:50,355 --> 01:11:52,673
You know she hates it
when you've been drinking.

1162
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:54,391
Stephanie, I'm the adult here.

1163
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:57,610
Morris.
Morris is also an adult.

1164
01:11:57,612 --> 01:11:59,713
Yes, the Professor
is also an adult.

1165
01:11:59,715 --> 01:12:01,098
I'm just a child.

1166
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:02,582
You are a child. Correct.

1167
01:12:02,584 --> 01:12:05,385
But I won't always be a child.

1168
01:12:05,387 --> 01:12:07,971
Stephanie, what's
gotten into you?

1169
01:12:07,973 --> 01:12:09,105
Morris...

1170
01:12:11,276 --> 01:12:13,359
It's been nice

1171
01:12:13,361 --> 01:12:15,128
meeting you.

1172
01:12:18,816 --> 01:12:20,250
Christ.

1173
01:12:21,618 --> 01:12:24,921
She's my own daughter, and I
don't even understand her.

1174
01:12:24,923 --> 01:12:26,789
I mean, she's acting like...

1175
01:12:26,791 --> 01:12:28,292
- I don't know.
- A woman?

1176
01:12:28,294 --> 01:12:32,462
Exactly. She's
acting like a woman.

1177
01:12:32,464 --> 01:12:35,198
And pretty soon, she'll be
going out on dates with boys,

1178
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,851
and... God, I don't even
want to think about

1179
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:40,787
what happens after that.

1180
01:12:40,789 --> 01:12:43,123
Can you believe she has
a date to the prom?

1181
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:44,591
Some guy.

1182
01:12:44,593 --> 01:12:47,060
She's bringing him over
for dinner tomorrow night.

1183
01:12:47,062 --> 01:12:49,796
- Really? Tomorrow?
- Yeah, and I will wax his tugboat...

1184
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:51,631
If he even thinks
about touching her.

1185
01:12:51,633 --> 01:12:53,166
Right.

1186
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:54,768
I mean...

1187
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:57,137
She's a good-looking
girl, right, Professor?

1188
01:12:57,139 --> 01:12:59,623
I mean, you wouldn't kick
her out of bed, would you?

1189
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:03,160
Ah, sweet baby Judas,
what am I sayin'?

1190
01:13:03,162 --> 01:13:05,662
You're a Bloody Eagle.

1191
01:13:05,664 --> 01:13:08,448
But that would be...
Weird, right?

1192
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:11,285
- Yeah. Weird.
- Yeah.

1193
01:13:11,287 --> 01:13:13,253
Look...

1194
01:13:13,255 --> 01:13:15,088
Stephen.

1195
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:17,858
Axe. Call me Axe.

1196
01:13:20,077 --> 01:13:21,261
Axe.

1197
01:13:24,615 --> 01:13:26,633
I've got to get going.

1198
01:13:26,635 --> 01:13:28,802
But what about that girl
you were waiting on?

1199
01:13:28,804 --> 01:13:30,554
Yeah, well,
Bloody Eagles, right?

1200
01:13:30,556 --> 01:13:32,556
Ha ha! Bloody Eagle, baby!

1201
01:13:34,443 --> 01:13:36,143
- Stephanie...
- Your place. Now.

1202
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:38,611
Who are you dating,
me or my dad?

1203
01:13:38,613 --> 01:13:40,080
And who is the tramp?

1204
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:41,548
Not here. Come on.

1205
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:44,151
Oh, wow, we're going up to your place?
What about daddy?

1206
01:13:46,454 --> 01:13:49,289
Morris, have you seen my keys?

1207
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:51,041
Oh. Hi, daddy.

1208
01:13:51,043 --> 01:13:52,909
Oh, I see.

1209
01:13:52,911 --> 01:13:53,910
Not now.

1210
01:13:57,298 --> 01:13:58,966
Ow, you're hurting me.

1211
01:13:58,968 --> 01:14:00,667
Sorry.

1212
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:02,652
It's okay. I kind of liked it.

1213
01:14:02,654 --> 01:14:06,340
Look, Stephanie,
this isn't working.

1214
01:14:06,342 --> 01:14:07,473
What isn't working?

1215
01:14:07,475 --> 01:14:09,476
This. Us.

1216
01:14:09,478 --> 01:14:10,743
You and me.

1217
01:14:11,896 --> 01:14:13,430
Are you breaking up with me?

1218
01:14:13,432 --> 01:14:15,365
'Cause it sounds like
you're breaking up with me.

1219
01:14:15,367 --> 01:14:18,568
No, I mean, it wasn't...
It's just... it's not...

1220
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:19,953
Did my dad put you up to this?

1221
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:22,572
Jetski? Are you kidding me?
He can never know.

1222
01:14:22,574 --> 01:14:23,690
Why not?

1223
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:25,759
It just wouldn't...

1224
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:28,362
I don't think your dad
would understand.

1225
01:14:28,364 --> 01:14:30,980
Look, I like you. I do.

1226
01:14:32,215 --> 01:14:34,117
You're fun, and...

1227
01:14:34,119 --> 01:14:35,452
And what?

1228
01:14:35,454 --> 01:14:38,271
Stephanie, it was
a mistake, an oversight.

1229
01:14:38,273 --> 01:14:39,756
We had sex.

1230
01:14:39,758 --> 01:14:42,391
Two fancy animals
doing what animals do.

1231
01:14:42,393 --> 01:14:43,976
An act of nature.

1232
01:14:43,978 --> 01:14:45,811
I think...

1233
01:14:45,813 --> 01:14:49,298
We should end the relationship
before the emotions get tangled.

1234
01:14:51,018 --> 01:14:53,136
Your emotions
are getting tangled?

1235
01:14:53,138 --> 01:14:55,271
Well, yeah, kind of.

1236
01:14:56,974 --> 01:14:59,743
And when you see me, you can't
control the animal in you?

1237
01:15:01,896 --> 01:15:04,064
Something like that.

1238
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:05,198
It's okay.

1239
01:15:08,469 --> 01:15:12,588
You know, you remind me
of this puppy I once had.

1240
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:15,042
He'd always whine for me
when I left

1241
01:15:15,044 --> 01:15:18,077
and hump my leg
when I came home, but...

1242
01:15:18,079 --> 01:15:20,413
I always loved him

1243
01:15:20,415 --> 01:15:22,349
until he got ran over by a car.

1244
01:15:24,268 --> 01:15:26,753
I don't think you're
understanding what I'm saying.

1245
01:15:26,755 --> 01:15:28,221
Oh, no. I understand.

1246
01:15:31,658 --> 01:15:33,560
You took your map down.

1247
01:15:33,562 --> 01:15:36,179
Yeah, I just... It was time.

1248
01:15:41,769 --> 01:15:43,803
Do you remember that
first time we met?

1249
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:47,524
Do you remember
the way I kissed you?

1250
01:15:47,526 --> 01:15:49,476
Do you remember
what we did after?

1251
01:15:51,446 --> 01:15:53,129
How can I forget?

1252
01:15:54,165 --> 01:15:55,532
The sex.

1253
01:15:56,968 --> 01:15:59,002
I feel like...

1254
01:15:59,004 --> 01:16:01,838
One of those
chocolate Easter Rabbits.

1255
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:02,939
All hollow inside.

1256
01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:08,294
It's all part of
growing up, I guess.

1257
01:16:11,732 --> 01:16:15,234
"Just two fancy animals
doing what they do."

1258
01:16:18,389 --> 01:16:20,206
Well. What doesn't kill you...

1259
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:21,725
...only makes you stronger.

1260
01:16:33,253 --> 01:16:36,222
Nice knowing you, Professor.

1261
01:17:16,313 --> 01:17:19,249
Keep the change,
and pop the trunk.

1262
01:17:19,251 --> 01:17:21,350
Thanks. Have a safe trip.

1263
01:17:21,352 --> 01:17:22,886
Since when do you take cabs?

1264
01:17:24,422 --> 01:17:26,623
I don't talk to strangers.

1265
01:17:27,792 --> 01:17:29,543
N.J., come on.

1266
01:17:29,545 --> 01:17:30,877
Let me help.

1267
01:17:36,417 --> 01:17:39,419
Don't expect a tip, man.

1268
01:17:39,421 --> 01:17:42,322
So you're really going out to
the Wild West to herd buffalo?

1269
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:44,424
Buffali, man, I told you.

1270
01:17:44,426 --> 01:17:46,342
- Sorry, I forgot.
- Forgot?

1271
01:17:46,344 --> 01:17:48,010
How 'bout not believed?

1272
01:17:48,012 --> 01:17:50,513
I believed.

1273
01:17:50,515 --> 01:17:51,981
Come on, let me buy you a beer.

1274
01:17:51,983 --> 01:17:53,616
Let's not leave on a bad note.

1275
01:17:56,787 --> 01:17:58,104
Okay, give me a minute.

1276
01:18:03,410 --> 01:18:04,744
Uh...

1277
01:18:04,746 --> 01:18:06,346
I got it.

1278
01:18:07,781 --> 01:18:09,916
Keep the change.

1279
01:18:09,918 --> 01:18:11,934
Where the hell
did you get that?

1280
01:18:11,936 --> 01:18:15,405
Hattie's dad. Little
walking-around money.

1281
01:18:15,407 --> 01:18:16,739
Here.

1282
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,011
Five hundred bucks?

1283
01:18:23,246 --> 01:18:26,182
You have been keeping
a tab, huh?

1284
01:18:29,586 --> 01:18:30,754
Eight hundred dollars.

1285
01:18:30,756 --> 01:18:32,172
Don't get greedy on me, man.

1286
01:18:32,174 --> 01:18:34,123
There's no way
I owe you more than that.

1287
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:36,976
- This is all real?
- What's real is real, man.

1288
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:42,749
So the guy who was always broke

1289
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:44,584
is now a member of
some big money cult.

1290
01:18:44,586 --> 01:18:46,052
Cartel, not cult.

1291
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:47,387
And not broke, just frugal.

1292
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:52,125
It's real. I already told
you what the initiation is.

1293
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:54,461
I gotta prompt a coup in
some third-world country.

1294
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:56,529
If you can't pull it off?

1295
01:18:56,531 --> 01:18:59,265
Style counts for a lot.

1296
01:18:59,267 --> 01:19:02,235
A guy can get in
strictly on style.

1297
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:04,087
Guy's going for
initiation tonight.

1298
01:19:04,089 --> 01:19:06,539
Knocking over Zambia.
Hattie will tell you.

1299
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:08,324
Yeah, when do I get
to meet this Hattie?

1300
01:19:08,326 --> 01:19:10,326
You been sending her
checks every month,

1301
01:19:10,328 --> 01:19:12,111
or at least your dad has.
She owns your building.

1302
01:19:12,113 --> 01:19:13,579
She owns my building?

1303
01:19:13,581 --> 01:19:15,381
That and about
50 others in the city.

1304
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:18,317
Her family's got the kind of
money that other money stops...

1305
01:19:18,319 --> 01:19:19,919
And stares at.

1306
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:24,791
I'm calling you out, Bliss!

1307
01:19:24,793 --> 01:19:26,292
- Isn't that Jetski?
- Yep.

1308
01:19:26,294 --> 01:19:28,511
- He's calling you out, man.
- Thanks. I heard.

1309
01:19:30,582 --> 01:19:32,648
I got a score
to settle with you!

1310
01:19:32,650 --> 01:19:34,016
You gonna need help on this?

1311
01:19:34,018 --> 01:19:36,102
I don't think so.

1312
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:38,521
Got your number,
I'm gonna punch your ticket!

1313
01:19:38,523 --> 01:19:40,072
You sure? He seems
pretty pissed,

1314
01:19:40,074 --> 01:19:41,741
but then again
I'd be pissed too

1315
01:19:41,743 --> 01:19:43,593
if you were screwing
my 15-year-old daughter.

1316
01:19:43,595 --> 01:19:44,810
Eighteen.

1317
01:19:45,913 --> 01:19:48,414
Hey, Bliss...

1318
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:50,950
Dude, you coming out, or am I
gonna have to drag you out?

1319
01:19:56,423 --> 01:19:58,591
Thank you.

1320
01:19:58,593 --> 01:20:00,226
One thing I learned
in Calcutta,

1321
01:20:00,228 --> 01:20:02,896
if he takes a swing at
you, lean into the punch.

1322
01:20:02,898 --> 01:20:05,297
When have you ever
been to Calcutta?

1323
01:20:08,468 --> 01:20:10,036
She told me everything, man.

1324
01:20:11,772 --> 01:20:13,489
She told me all about
the two of you.

1325
01:20:15,442 --> 01:20:17,793
You betrayed me, Bliss.

1326
01:20:17,795 --> 01:20:21,431
A fellow Bloody Eagle,
and you betray me?

1327
01:20:21,433 --> 01:20:22,898
You know what...?

1328
01:20:24,034 --> 01:20:25,768
She doesn't love you, Bliss.

1329
01:20:25,770 --> 01:20:29,171
Read it and weep, fellow Eagle.

1330
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:37,780
Okay.

1331
01:20:38,949 --> 01:20:41,934
Excuse me? "Okay"? Okay what?

1332
01:20:41,936 --> 01:20:43,602
What's okay?! Just... just okay.

1333
01:20:43,604 --> 01:20:45,938
You. Us. Stephanie.

1334
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:49,325
Do not. Say. Her name.

1335
01:20:49,327 --> 01:20:52,161
- I just meant...
- Don't try taking my daughter from me.

1336
01:20:52,163 --> 01:20:54,630
- I haven't taken anything.
- You took her virginity, man.

1337
01:20:54,632 --> 01:20:56,065
I didn't take that.

1338
01:20:59,303 --> 01:21:01,587
Oh, okay. Okay,
you're calling her...

1339
01:21:01,589 --> 01:21:03,989
I'm not calling her anything.
All I'm saying...

1340
01:21:07,327 --> 01:21:08,994
Don't take her from me, Bliss.
You hear me?

1341
01:21:08,996 --> 01:21:10,296
Do not take my
daughter from me.

1342
01:21:10,298 --> 01:21:12,198
Do not take my daughter
from me, Bliss.

1343
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,666
Do not take her.

1344
01:21:13,668 --> 01:21:16,269
- Stephen, I'm...
- Shut up!

1345
01:21:16,271 --> 01:21:19,105
And stay away from
my family, man.

1346
01:21:22,459 --> 01:21:24,126
Bloody Eagles!

1347
01:21:29,933 --> 01:21:31,267
That was weird, man.

1348
01:21:34,121 --> 01:21:36,072
You got something on your face.

1349
01:21:37,290 --> 01:21:38,625
No. The other side.

1350
01:21:44,297 --> 01:21:45,632
I'm bleeding.

1351
01:21:45,634 --> 01:21:48,518
Why didn't you lean into
it, like I told you?

1352
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:53,673
Morris, this is Hattie.
Hattie, this is...

1353
01:21:58,979 --> 01:22:00,313
...Morris.

1354
01:22:02,983 --> 01:22:05,050
Oh, your face is bleeding.

1355
01:22:05,052 --> 01:22:07,687
Have we met

1356
01:22:07,689 --> 01:22:09,389
before?

1357
01:22:09,391 --> 01:22:11,791
You... live in my building.

1358
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:13,259
She owns your building, man.

1359
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:14,727
I own some things,

1360
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:16,729
but my family,
they own other things.

1361
01:22:16,731 --> 01:22:18,715
I know you, though.

1362
01:22:18,717 --> 01:22:20,099
No, you don't.

1363
01:22:20,101 --> 01:22:21,834
Your face is still
bleeding, by the way.

1364
01:22:23,470 --> 01:22:25,605
Saturday, the construction
site, is how I know you.

1365
01:22:28,959 --> 01:22:31,360
I think you must have
gotten hit really hard.

1366
01:22:31,362 --> 01:22:35,331
You've got me confused
with somebody else.

1367
01:22:35,333 --> 01:22:38,634
Yeah, you don't look
so good, man.

1368
01:22:38,636 --> 01:22:41,070
Jetski did catch you
pretty bad, huh?

1369
01:22:41,072 --> 01:22:42,955
Yeah, you're right. He did.

1370
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:02,725
I'll send you
some buffali hide.

1371
01:23:08,314 --> 01:23:09,582
Keep safe.

1372
01:23:09,584 --> 01:23:11,667
Yeah, you too.

1373
01:23:38,295 --> 01:23:39,612
Uh...

1374
01:24:12,312 --> 01:24:15,565
Shit.

1375
01:24:22,155 --> 01:24:25,508
- Andrea.
- Right. Oh, that looks like it hurt.

1376
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:27,293
Listen, um...

1377
01:24:27,295 --> 01:24:29,178
I was talking to
Georgie last night,

1378
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:32,131
and... I told him everything.

1379
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:34,100
- Everything?
- Right.

1380
01:24:34,102 --> 01:24:36,519
And he was upset about it,
but I explained everything,

1381
01:24:36,521 --> 01:24:39,655
and he has something
he wants to tell you, so...

1382
01:24:41,141 --> 01:24:42,274
George.

1383
01:24:44,110 --> 01:24:45,962
Like she said, I was pissed,

1384
01:24:45,964 --> 01:24:48,047
and when I'm pissed,
I usually hit things.

1385
01:24:48,049 --> 01:24:49,248
Look, George, I...

1386
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,066
I'm talkin' here.

1387
01:24:50,068 --> 01:24:52,118
Sorry.

1388
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:55,454
Like I was sayin',
I was pissed,

1389
01:24:55,456 --> 01:24:59,125
but Angie explained it
all to me, and I wanted to...

1390
01:25:01,978 --> 01:25:03,312
go ahead.

1391
01:25:06,817 --> 01:25:10,053
I want to say... Thank you.

1392
01:25:10,055 --> 01:25:12,288
You're welcome.

1393
01:25:13,924 --> 01:25:15,257
Good boy, Georgie.

1394
01:25:16,593 --> 01:25:20,179
So, I-I was
explaining to Georgie

1395
01:25:20,181 --> 01:25:22,681
that I was telling you how I
was feeling unappreciated

1396
01:25:22,683 --> 01:25:26,269
and how you...

1397
01:25:26,271 --> 01:25:30,439
encouraged me to...
express myself to him.

1398
01:25:30,441 --> 01:25:31,991
Right?

1399
01:25:31,993 --> 01:25:33,860
I certainly appreciated
it last night!

1400
01:25:33,862 --> 01:25:36,128
Just... stop!

1401
01:25:39,183 --> 01:25:42,434
I just wanted to say
thank you as well,

1402
01:25:42,436 --> 01:25:44,269
for listening...

1403
01:25:44,271 --> 01:25:45,738
And talking.

1404
01:25:47,509 --> 01:25:48,907
Any time.

1405
01:25:48,909 --> 01:25:51,527
Anyway, we've got
to run, right?

1406
01:26:11,398 --> 01:26:12,732
And a paper too.

1407
01:26:18,739 --> 01:26:21,407
This place is huge.

1408
01:26:29,299 --> 01:26:30,783
N.J.!

1409
01:26:34,587 --> 01:26:37,757
Ouch. Jetski did punch
your ticket, huh?

1410
01:26:37,759 --> 01:26:40,393
Fancy animals, right?

1411
01:26:40,395 --> 01:26:42,678
Well, at least your
face stopped bleeding.

1412
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:43,913
Yeah, it did.

1413
01:26:46,166 --> 01:26:48,484
So this is it.

1414
01:26:48,486 --> 01:26:49,602
This is it.

1415
01:26:52,205 --> 01:26:53,990
Hey, how's Mr. Charlie's?

1416
01:26:53,992 --> 01:26:56,358
I don't know.
I went to the supermarket.

1417
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:57,777
Hey.

1418
01:26:57,779 --> 01:27:00,679
That first time we met,

1419
01:27:00,681 --> 01:27:04,417
you were the rock.
I was Mark Spitz.

1420
01:27:04,419 --> 01:27:06,068
Didn't I save you?

1421
01:27:07,637 --> 01:27:09,755
One thing I learned
in prison in Haiti, man...

1422
01:27:09,757 --> 01:27:10,756
Oh.

1423
01:27:10,758 --> 01:27:12,258
...keeping 100% true to a tale

1424
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:13,725
isn't what's important.

1425
01:27:13,727 --> 01:27:15,727
What's important is the story,

1426
01:27:15,729 --> 01:27:18,080
the moral, whether it
lingers and lives on

1427
01:27:18,082 --> 01:27:19,582
after it's been told.

1428
01:27:19,584 --> 01:27:22,234
That, man,
that's what's important.

1429
01:27:22,236 --> 01:27:23,569
Yeah, it's important.

1430
01:27:24,972 --> 01:27:26,472
Page 12.

1431
01:27:26,474 --> 01:27:28,558
Huh?

1432
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:30,276
Page 12.

1433
01:27:30,278 --> 01:27:31,944
Boom!

1434
01:27:35,999 --> 01:27:37,516
Giddyap.

1435
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:48,161
Son of a bitch.

1436
01:28:04,594 --> 01:28:07,430
Happy Birthday, dad.

1437
01:28:07,432 --> 01:28:09,899
What the hell happened to you?

1438
01:28:09,901 --> 01:28:12,235
I made a choice.

1439
01:28:12,237 --> 01:28:14,186
Bad choice.

1440
01:28:16,023 --> 01:28:17,756
You remembered.

1441
01:28:22,896 --> 01:28:25,748
And... you finally
got the groceries.

1442
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:27,984
Some things take time.

1443
01:28:35,492 --> 01:28:37,376
Aren't you gonna open it?

1444
01:28:39,929 --> 01:28:41,264
Sure.

1445
01:29:09,108 --> 01:29:10,776
Oh, my God.

1446
01:29:14,564 --> 01:29:16,232
Where did you find it?

1447
01:29:16,234 --> 01:29:18,251
You like it?

1448
01:29:18,253 --> 01:29:22,021
Your mother and I used to
listen to this all the time.

1449
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:24,490
I can't believe you remembered.

1450
01:29:32,432 --> 01:29:34,816
You okay, dad?

1451
01:29:38,571 --> 01:29:39,921
Yeah.

1452
01:29:42,592 --> 01:29:43,926
I'm fine.

1453
01:30:05,933 --> 01:30:09,535
You, uh, you might be
interested in that.

1454
01:30:12,439 --> 01:30:13,906
It's your mother's.

1455
01:30:16,476 --> 01:30:20,646
Letters I wrote to her
and she wrote to me,

1456
01:30:20,648 --> 01:30:22,581
and pictures.

1457
01:30:33,309 --> 01:30:34,643
I was, uh...

1458
01:30:36,646 --> 01:30:39,347
I was about your age
when she died.

1459
01:30:48,375 --> 01:30:49,709
I'm...

1460
01:30:51,978 --> 01:30:54,079
I'm sorry. I...

1461
01:30:56,149 --> 01:30:57,716
I never really...

1462
01:31:04,841 --> 01:31:07,326
Your mother's death must
have been very hard on you.

1463
01:31:07,328 --> 01:31:09,962
You were... you were
just a child.

1464
01:31:11,431 --> 01:31:12,815
I was 14.

1465
01:31:15,618 --> 01:31:17,787
I understood.

1466
01:31:37,274 --> 01:31:39,274
Oh.

1467
01:31:39,276 --> 01:31:41,310
This was, uh...

1468
01:31:41,312 --> 01:31:43,862
This was her last
hurrah, so to speak.

1469
01:31:45,298 --> 01:31:47,600
Trip to her homeland.

1470
01:31:50,370 --> 01:31:52,821
Who's that in
the picture with mom?

1471
01:31:52,823 --> 01:31:55,474
Oh, it's your aunt Kristina.

1472
01:31:55,476 --> 01:31:57,076
Whatever happened to her?

1473
01:31:57,078 --> 01:31:59,644
She got married,

1474
01:31:59,646 --> 01:32:01,347
had a kid, and...

1475
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:03,315
Went back to Greece.

1476
01:32:05,152 --> 01:32:07,102
Do you have her number?

1477
01:32:52,466 --> 01:32:53,482
Thanks.

1478
01:32:59,722 --> 01:33:01,056
I'm going.

1479
01:33:06,479 --> 01:33:08,814
Got everything?

1480
01:33:08,816 --> 01:33:09,948
Think so.

1481
01:33:11,968 --> 01:33:14,219
You need anything before I go?

1482
01:33:15,605 --> 01:33:17,606
I'm good.

1483
01:33:19,275 --> 01:33:21,127
Okay, then.

1484
01:33:21,129 --> 01:33:22,161
Okay.

1485
01:33:24,030 --> 01:33:25,748
Oh, Morris.

1486
01:33:27,501 --> 01:33:30,085
Have you seen my keys?
