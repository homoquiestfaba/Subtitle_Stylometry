CHATTING TOO LONG, HUH?

IT'S NOT SMOKING!

378
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:06,866

379
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:09,535

00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,637
SORRY ABOUT THE INCONVENIENCE.

381
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,439
- INCONVENIENCE?!

382
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:16,742
- WOW, THAT'S A STRONG ROOF.

383
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,711
YOU KNOW, THIS WOULD BE
A REALLY COOL HOUSE TO BE IN

384
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:20,479
IF THERE WAS A HURRICANE.

385
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,982
- VERY COOL NOW THAT THERE'S
A HOLE IN THE ROOF!

386
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,653
[door slams]
- THEY PROBABLY DON'T GET

387
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,388
TOO MANY HURRICANES
AROUND HERE, HUH?

388
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,624
- NOT AROUND THESE PARTS.

389
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:34,360
- WHO ARE YOU?
WHAT HAPPENED?

390
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,628
- I WISH I KNEW.

391
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:38,397
UH, WE WAS FLYING ALONG--

392
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,698
- WE WERE ACTUALLY
ON OUR WAY TO LAS VEGAS

393
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,467
FOR A ROMANTIC VALENTINE'S DAY.

394
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,936
- IT WAS LIKE WE JUST FELL
PLUM OUT OF THE SKY.

395
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:45,504
YOU KNOW, IN OVER 30 YEARS
OF FLYING,

396
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:48,541
I NEVER EXPERIENCED
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,784
PEPPER UPPER.

401
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,386
- EXCUSE ME?

402
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:01,854
- PEPPER UPPER.

403
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:02,922
ACTUALLY, IT'S JUST THE NAME
I DANCED WITH

404
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:04,490
WHEN I WAS A PROFESSIONAL.

405
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,791
BUT I DECIDED I LIKED IT
A LOT MORE

406
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,560
THAN MY REAL NAME,
PENELOPE JOHNSTON.

407
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,895
SORT OF BORING.
ANYWAY, PEPPER UPPER'S CATCHY.

408
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,797
KIND OF LIKE A SODA.

409

PROTECTS TRAVELERS.

426
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:45,865

ST. CHRISTOPHER'S DAY.

427
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,166
THIS IS YOUR SON?

00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:32,077
AND I WAS JUST LUCKY ENOUGH
TO BE BORN TO IT.

453
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,679

00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,600

00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:31,390
JARVIS MOODY OF
THE UNIGLOBE LIFE INSURANCE

527
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:35,194
AND THE GOOD OLD EASY LIFE
I WAS BORN TO, YEE-HA.

528
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:36,795
- WELL, AT LEAST HE SENT
THE CLEANING SERVICE

529
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:37,830
LIKE HE PROMISED.

530
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,898
I THINK HE'S SINCERE.

531
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:41,700
- ANYBODY WORTH THAT
AMOUNT OF MONEY

532
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,869
DOESN'T FLY ANYWHERE
IN A LITTLE SINGLE ENGINE PLANE.

533
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:46,071
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN
JET WITH AN ACE PILOT

534
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:47,973
ON THE COMPANY PAYROLL.

535
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:50,976
- SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING--
THAT HE ISN'T WHO HE SAYS HE IS?

536
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:54,046
- I DON'T GIVE A SHIT.
AS LONG AS HE FIXES MY ROOF.

537
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,951
- WHEN DID YOU BECOME
SO BITTER?

538
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,686
- SOME PEOPLE GO GRAY.

539
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:07,392
WHY DON'T YOU STOP
FOR THE NIGHT?

540
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,161
EVEN THE POPE SLEEPS.

541
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:10,896
- THE POPE ISN'T A MOM.

542
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:11,864
[cutting]

543
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:15,367
- ALICE, WE HAVE TO TALK.

544
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,302
- I TOLD YOU.
I FORGOT HOW.

545
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,105
- MOVE YOUR LIPS.
SOMETHING WILL COME OUT.

546
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,174
- THAT'S WHAT I'M AFRAID OF.

547
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:36,021
- YOU HAVEN'T FILLED OUT
THE APPLICATION.

548
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:37,389
- I WILL.

549
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:41,026
- WILLIAM FAULKNER TOOK
LESS TIME TO WRITE

550
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,261
 THE SOUND AND THE FURY.

551
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:43,795
- IF YOU THINK IT'S SO EASY

552
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:45,998
TO WRITE ABOUT 13 YEARS
OF KNOWING OUR SON

553
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,100
IN THE ALLOTTED SPACE BELOW,
THEN YOU DO IT!

554
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,501
- I WOULD, ONLY YOU SAID
YOU WANTED TO DO IT.

555
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,003
- I WILL!

556
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,471
- IT HAS TO BE IN
BEFORE HIS BIRTHDAY.

557
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:54,072
- IT WILL BE IF YOU'LL
JUST STOP--

558
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:55,774
- WHY IS IT EVERY TIME
WE TALK ABOUT THIS

559
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:57,309
THE APPLICATIONS PILE UP,

560
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:59,244
AND I END UP FEELING LIKE
A SELFISH SON OF A BITCH

561
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:00,512
WHO WANTS TO GET RID OF
HIS KID?

562
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,915
- IS THAT A RHETORICAL QUESTION?

563
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:05,851
- ANDY LIKES IT THERE.

564
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,819
- WHAT?

565
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:10,088
- HE LIKES IT.
I TOOK HIM.

566
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:13,258
- YOU WHAT? WHEN?

567
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:16,061
- A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO
WHEN YOU HAD YOUR HAIRCUT.

568
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,463
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU WOULD DO THAT.

569
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:21,066
I TAKE ONE AFTERNOON OFF,
AND YOU TAKE ANDY THERE?

570
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,935
- THE DOCTOR TOLD ME
FOR ANDY TO HAVE

571
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:24,770
ANY KIND OF A CHANCE

572
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,838
FOR A REASONABLY NORMAL LIFE

573
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:27,973
THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME.

574
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:29,174
THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE.

575
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,842
YOU SHOULD SEE HIM THERE,
ALICE.

576
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,511
HE WAS HAPPY.
THERE WERE OTHER KIDS.

577
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:35,480
THEY ACTUALLY WERE
PLAYING TOGETHER.

578
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,116
WHY IS IT EVERY TIME
WE TALK ABOUT THIS

579
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:39,384
YOU START CLEANING?!

580
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,820
- BECAUSE THIS HOUSE
IS A MESS.

581
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,355
- IT'S NOT THE HOUSE
THAT'S THE MESS.

582
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:45,891
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD
BETRAY ME LIKE THAT.

583
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,326
- BETRAY YOU? THAT'S A LITTLE
DRAMATIC, DON'T YOU THINK?

584
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:49,494
- I AM HIS MOTHER!

585
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,263
- WILL YOU STOP FOR A MINUTE
AND LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS!

586
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:53,231
- I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU!

587
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,434
[doorbell]
- WHO THE HELL IS THAT?

588
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,838
- EVENING.
- HI.

589
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:03,308
OH, I HOPE WE'RE NOT
DISTURBING YOU.

590
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:06,411
- WELL, THANK YOU FOR
USING THE FRONT DOOR THIS TIME.

591
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,514
- OH.
[both laugh]

592
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,149
- COME ON IN.

593
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:12,517
- OH, JUST FOR A MINUTE.
- THANKS.

594
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,252
[laughs]

595
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,388
- WE MADE THE LATE EDITION.

596
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:19,057
THE ARTICLE WASN'T ALL THAT
FLATTERING TO THE PILOT.

597
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:21,460
- AW, HONEY!
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

598
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,128
IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO
ANYBODY.

599
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,930
- UH-HUH.

600
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,299
- HI.
- OH, HI.

601
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:30,602
- [sighs] YOU TWO LOOK SO CLEAN
AND DRESSED UP.

602
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,105
I'M STILL A SLOB.
- OH, COME ON.

603
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,840
AFTER THE DAY YOU HAD,
YOU LOOK JUST GREAT.

604
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,009
- JUST WANTED TO DROP BY
AND APOLOGIZE AGAIN

605
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:38,143
FOR ALL THE COMMOTION.

606
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:39,878
- YEAH, WE JUST FELT SO BAD

607
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:40,979
ABOUT SCARING YOUR SON
AND EVERYTHING.

608
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,381
JARVIS SAID WE HAD TO STOP BY

609
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:44,049
AND GET THOSE NICE PEOPLE
A LITTLE SOMETHING

610
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:45,117
AND SEE HOW THEY'RE DOING

611
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,585
BEFORE WE HEAD OVER TO VEGAS.

612
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:48,153
SO, HERE YOU GO.
THIS BIG ONE'S FOR ANDY.

613
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:50,622
AND, UH, HERE.
THIS IS FOR YOU.

614
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,291
- OH, THAT'S SO NICE.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

615
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,894
- GRANDMA MOODY ALWAYS
USED TO SAY

616
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,096
"HAVE TO AND WANT TO
MAY SOUND THE SAME,

617
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:00,465
"BUT THEY'RE AS DIFFERENT
AS THIS AND THAT."

618
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,334
- SHE SAID THAT?
- YES, SIR.

619
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,904
- OH!
- WELL.

620
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,339
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW
TOO MUCH ABOUT CHAMPAGNE.

621
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:09,374
BUT I SURE THOUGHT THIS
WAS THE PRETTIEST BOTTLE.

622
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,009
I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS
PAINTED

623
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,144
BY ONE OF THOSE FRENCH PAINTERS,

624
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,211
THE IMPRESSIONABLES.

625
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:14,513
- IMPRESSIONISTS.

626
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:16,515
THEY'VE BEEN DEAD FOR
OVER 100 YEARS.

627
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:17,916
- OH, THAT'S A SHAME.

628
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,384
THEY PAINTED SUCH
PRETTY PICTURES.

629
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,620
- YEAH, YOU SAVE THAT
FOR AN OCCASION.

630
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,288
- OH.
- WE BEST BE ON OUR WAY.

631
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:25,057
- WELL, THANK YOU
FOR DROPPING BY.

632
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:26,958
- OH, SHALL WE, DOLL?

633
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,560
- UH, WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO
STAY AND HAVE SOME CHAMPAGNE?

634
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,228
- NO, ALICE, THEY BETTER
GET GOING.

635
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:31,997
IT'S A LONG DRIVE TO VEGAS.

636
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,099
- YEAH, YOU OUGHT TO DRINK
THAT WITH SOME SPECIAL FRIENDS.

637
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:36,301
- WHAT'S MORE SPECIAL
THAN NEW FRIENDS?

638
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:37,569
- THAT'S TRUE, AND AFTER ALL
ST. VALENTINE

639
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,171
DID BRING US TOGETHER.
[laughs]

640
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,539
- YEAH, WELL, IF YOU DON'T
GET GOING SOON,

641
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:42,607
IT MIGHT BE ST. NICK.

642
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:43,675
- WHO ARE WE TO MESS
WITH THE SAINTS?

643
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,143
LET'S GIVE ANDY HIS PRESENT,

644
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:47,913
AND THEN WE'LL HAVE A TOAST.

645
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,920
[ripping]

646
00:30:57,322 --> 00:31:00,258
- OH! AN ERECTOR SET.

647
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:02,461
- OH, THAT'S A CHALLENGING GIFT.

648
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:04,162
- OH, MY BROTHER
JUST LOVED HIS.

649
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:05,630
AT FIRST, I WAS AFRAID
THAT MAYBE

650
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,399
IT WAS JUST A LITTLE
TOO ADVANCED.

651
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:09,601
BUT THEN WE FIGURED IT WAS
THE RIGHT KIND OF CHALLENGE.

652
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:11,303
- GRANDMA MOODY ALWAYS SAID

653
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:12,671
"IF YOU CAN'T REACH THE APPLE

654
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:15,140
"THERE'S ALWAYS A LADDER
STANDING BY."

655
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,341
- ANYWAY, I THOUGHT IT WAS
SOMETHING

656
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:17,642
THAT EVERYBODY COULD DO
TOGETHER.

657
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:22,013
- OH. WELL, THANKS.
THAT'S NICE.

658
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,348
- WHY DON'T ALL OF YOU
GO DOWNSTAIRS,

659
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:25,016
AND I'LL PUT ANDY TO BED.

660
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:27,052
[pats]

661
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:30,388
- [laughs]
THANK YOU.

662
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,324
- TO NEW FRIENDS.
- NEW FRIENDS!

663
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:34,092
- TO NEW ROOFS.
- HERE! HERE!

664
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,596
- MMM. DELICIOUS.

665
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:39,431
- OOH, IT IS GOOD.

666
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:41,733
- WHY DON'T WE ALL SIT DOWN?
- OKAY.

667
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,668
- [sighs]

668
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:45,737
- THAT-- THAT WAS SO NICE
OF YOU.

669
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,973
- OH, WELL, JARVIS MOODY
IS NOT ONLY

670
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:50,008
THE MOST GENEROUS MAN
I'VE EVER MET,

671
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:52,144
HE'S ALSO THE MOST ROMANTIC.

672
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:53,578
[kissing sounds]

673
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:58,283
I MEAN, TAKING ME TO LAS VEGAS
ON VALENTINE'S DAY.

674
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,485
ISN'T THAT JUST THE MOST
ROMANTIC THING!

675
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:06,358
[kissing sounds]
- [sighs]

676
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:12,297
- TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE BEFORE.

677
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:14,032
BUT JARVIS SAYS THAT THEY HAVE
GOT BEDS

678
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,234
IN THE SHAPES OF HEARTS.

679
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:17,235
- SOMETHING TELLS ME
YOU'RE GOING TO BE

680
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:18,470
SEEING ONE FOR YOURSELF.

681
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,306
- OH, I HOPE SO.
[laughs]

682
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:23,742
SO, WHAT DO YOU TWO
HAVE PLANNED FOR TONIGHT?

683
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:25,310
- NOTHING.

684
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,679
DONALD'S NOT WHAT YOU CALL
A ROMANTIC.

685
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,115
- OUR BED'S MORE RECTANGULAR.

686
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:32,684
- [laughs]

687
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:44,462
♪ ♪

688
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,164
- SO, PEPPER, YOU WERE
A PROFESSIONAL DANCER?

689
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,532
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
AN EXOTIC DANCER.

690
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:22,167
BUT NOT FOR VERY LONG.

691
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,336
THERE WAS NOTHING
ALL THAT EXOTIC ABOUT IT.

692
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,171
- IS THAT WHERE
YOU AND JARVIS MET?

693
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:29,507
- UH-UH.
- I DON'T GO INTO THOSE PLACES.

694
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,775
- REALLY?

695
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:33,144
- SO, UM, WHERE DID YOU TWO

MAYBE TRY IT ON ANDY.

870
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:16,868
- WELL, THANKS, PEPPER.
BUT WE HAVE OUR OWN SYSTEM.

871
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,669
- YEAH, THERE'S A SYSTEM
FOR EVERYTHING IN THIS HOUSE.

872
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:20,872
IT'S LIKE LIVING
IN MISSION CONTROL.

873
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,107
- AH, IT'S GETTING ON...
- COME ON LET ME GET YOU TO BED.

874
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:24,609
- JARVIS, HONEY, I KNOW WE GOT
TO GET GOING.

875
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:26,377
BUT I THINK IT'S
THE LEAST WE CAN DO.

876
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,046
- IT'S REALLY OKAY, PEPPER.
I'M USED TO DEALING WITH THIS.

877
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,015
- ALICE, IT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU CAN'T LEARN SOMETHING NEW.

878
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:36,621
- THERE'S A LOT MORE SALT TO
THAT PEPPER THAN MEETS THE EYE.

879
00:42:36,621 --> 00:42:39,157
NOT THAT WHAT MEETS THE EYE
IS ALL THAT BAD.

880
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:40,625
- [laughs]

881
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:41,893
- WOULD YOU LIKE A DRINK,
JARVIS?

882
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:43,294
- I'M FINE.

883
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,997
- I KNOW YOU'RE FINE.
BUT ARE YOU LOOSE?

884
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:47,799
GO TO VEGAS WITH
A GIRL LIKE THAT,

885
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:50,902
YOU GOT TO BE WILLING
TO ROLL THE DICE, RIGHT?

886
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:53,805
COME ON, JARVIS,

887
00:42:53,805 --> 00:42:55,406
THE LADIES ARE GOING TO
BE UP THERE FOR A LONG TIME.

888
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:59,210
IF I KNOW MY WIFE, SOMETIMES
IT TAKES ALICE ALL NIGHT.

889
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,245
YOU THINK THAT'S
THE PROBLEM WITH MY MARRIAGE?

890
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,314
SHE SLEEPS MORE WITH OUR SON
THAN SHE DOES WITH ME?

891
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:04,949
- I WOULDN'T KNOW.

892
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:06,884
- NO, MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T.

893
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:08,820
YOU EVER BEEN MARRIED,
JARVIS?

894
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,855
- ONCE.
- YEAH, WHAT HAPPENED?

895
00:43:10,855 --> 00:43:13,091
SHE RUN OFF WITH
A YOUNG RODEO RIDER?

896
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:15,827
- NO, WE WERE TOGETHER
TILL THE DAY SHE DIED.

897
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:18,296
- SORRY.

898
00:43:18,296 --> 00:43:21,399
- HOW COULD YOU BE?
YOU NEVER MET HER.

899
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:24,202
- HOW ABOUT SOME BOURBON?

900
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:25,870
YOU SOUTHERN BOYS
LIKE BOURBON.

901
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:28,773
- WHY I'M FROM TEXAS.

902
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:31,409
- I STAND CORRECTED.
YOU TEXAS BOYS LIKE BOURBON.

903
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:33,344
- ON THE RIGHT OCCASION.

904
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:35,146
- WELL, DO YOU CONSIDER THIS
THE RIGHT OCCASION?

905
00:43:35,146 --> 00:43:39,650
- AH, ABOUT AS RIGHT
AS IT'S GONNA GET.

906
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:45,256
NICE BIG YARD.

907
00:43:45,256 --> 00:43:47,225
YOU EVER THINK OF
PUTTING IN A POOL?

908
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:50,928
- WHAT YOU THINK
I CAN'T AFFORD IT?

909
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:52,730
- AH, I NEVER SAID THAT.

910
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:56,901
MOST FOLKS IN SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA HAVE POOLS IS ALL.

911
00:43:56,901 --> 00:44:00,705
- IF WE WANTED A POOL,
WE'D HAVE A POOL.

912
00:44:00,705 --> 00:44:02,773
ANDY NEEDS THE GRASS
FOR EXERCISE.

913
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:04,075
- I HAPPEN TO AGREE WITH YOU.

914
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:07,111
A GROWING BOY NEEDS
ROOM TO GRAZE.

915
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,416
[smacks lips]

916
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:14,452
- SO, JARVIS, PRETTY IMPRESSIVE

917
00:44:14,452 --> 00:44:16,821
PICKING UP YOUNG GIRLS
IN GAS STATIONS.

918
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,890
- YOU GET DONE WHAT NEEDS
TO GET DONE

919
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:20,324
TILL THE GOOD LORD
GETS DONE WITH YOU.

920
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,993
- [laughs]

921
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:24,262
I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF I COULD DO IT ANYMORE.

922
00:44:24,262 --> 00:44:27,198
ALL THE RIGHT MOVES AND...

923
00:44:27,198 --> 00:44:28,966
YOU'RE PRETTY SMOOTH THOUGH.

924
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:31,869
YOU GOT THAT "AW SHUCKS" THING
DOWN TO AN ART.

925
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:33,237
[laughs]

926
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:35,006
- YOU ALWAYS THIS PISSED OFF
AT THE WORLD?

927
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:37,241
- I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
I HAD A BAD MORNING.

928
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:38,476
YOU KNOW, ARGUMENT
WITH THE WIFE.

929
00:44:38,476 --> 00:44:39,944
NO COMMUNICATION
WITH THE SON.

930
00:44:39,944 --> 00:44:41,178
AIRPLANE CRASHING
THROUGH THE ROOF.

931
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,747
YOU KNOW, JUST ONE OF
THOSE DAYS.

932
00:44:42,747 --> 00:44:45,850
- IT COULD HAVE BEEN
A HELL OF A LOT WORSE.

933
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,185
IN FACT, FROM WHERE
I'M STANDING,

934
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:49,187
SO COULD YOUR LIFE.

935
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:52,390
- FROM WHERE YOU'RE STANDING,
YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE MY LIFE.

936
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:54,358
- GRANDMA MOODY USED TO SAY

937
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,261
"IF YOU HAVE TO LOOK OVER YOUR
FENCE TO SEE YOURSELF,

938
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:59,230
"YOU BEST MOVE."

939
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,232
- WHAT THE HELL IS
THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

940
00:45:01,232 --> 00:45:03,901
YOU SPOUT ALL THESE HOMILIES
FROM YOUR GRANDMA

941
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:06,771
AND YOUR GREAT GRANDPAPPY
LIKE IT WAS THE GOSPEL.

942
00:45:06,771 --> 00:45:09,407
- WELL, WE ALL NEED WORDS
TO LIVE BY.

943
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:11,442
- WHO'S IN THERE, JARVIS?

944
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:12,977
DO YOU EVER GET MAD?

945
00:45:12,977 --> 00:45:14,946
DO YOU EVEN SWEAT?
ARE YOU FUCKING HUMAN?

946
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:20,251
- WELL, HOWEVER LONG
I'M STUCK HERE

947
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:23,854
I WOULD EXPECT YOU TO BEHAVE
LIKE A GENTLEMAN.

948
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:27,024
AND I WILL DO MY DAMNEDEST
TO DO THE SAME.

949
00:45:31,796 --> 00:45:33,364
- TEACH ME TO DANCE.

950
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:36,400
- [snorts laughter]

951
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,935
WHAT?

952
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:39,437
- COME ON.

953
00:45:39,437 --> 00:45:41,372
JARVIS, AS LONG AS
YOU'RE STUCK HERE,

954
00:45:41,372 --> 00:45:43,574
YOU MIGHT AS WELL DO
SOMETHING CONSTRUCTIVE.

955
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,810
- YOU ARE ONE CRAZY
SON OF A BITCH.

956
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,445
- YOU SMASHED THROUGH MY ROOF,
AND I'M NOT GONNA SUE YOU.

957
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:50,147
I'M JUST ASKING FOR
A LITTLE INSTRUCTION HERE.

958
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:52,550
I SAW YOU WITH PEPPER.
YOU'RE REALLY SMOOTH.

959
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:55,119
WHAT'S THAT COWBOY DANCE
THING YOU GUYS ALWAYS DO?

960
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,487
WHAT'S THAT CALLED?
- THE TWO STEP.

961
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:57,855
- WELL, SEE THAT'S PERFECT.

962
00:45:57,855 --> 00:45:59,056
ALICE IS ALWAYS COMPLAINING

963
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:00,591
ABOUT ME NOT KNOWING THE STEPS.

964
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,426
IF THEY'RE ONLY TWO,
MAYBE I CAN LEARN 'EM.

965
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,829
- YOU ARE DUMBER THAN
A ROOSTER'S I.Q.

966
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:06,831
- I KNOW I CAN BE
A PRICK SOMETIMES.

967
00:46:06,831 --> 00:46:08,432
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.
PLEASE. COME ON.

968
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,500
TEACH ME HOW TO DANCE.

969
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,901
MAYBE IT WILL SAVE MY MARRIAGE.

970
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:12,436
- FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN,

971
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:15,206
YOU NEED A HELL OF A LOT MORE
THAN A FEW DANCE STEPS.

972
00:46:15,206 --> 00:46:18,175
FIRST THING, YOU'VE GOT
TO HAVE THE RIGHT MUSIC.

973
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:20,177
- SOMETHING COUNTRY, RIGHT?

974
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:22,546
- [laughs]
WHY, DONALD...

975
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:24,115
YOU'VE BEEN HOLDING OUT
ON ME.

976
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:26,417
- YEAH, WE ALL GOT A LITTLE
COWBOY IN US.

977
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:28,519
- NO WONDER YOU HAD
A BAD DREAM, HONEY.

978
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:30,521
YOU GOT TOO FRUSTRATED
BEFORE BED.

979
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:33,190
SHOULD HAVE WAITED FOR DADDY AND
ME TO HELP YOU WITH THIS.

980
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:35,226
- WELL, AT LEAST HE TRIED.

981
00:46:35,226 --> 00:46:37,528
- PEPPER, I KNOW WHAT MY SON
CAN AND CAN'T DO.

982
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:39,397
- I'M SURE YOU DO, ALICE.

983
00:46:39,397 --> 00:46:41,866
IT'S JUST THAT SOMETIMES YOU CAN
GET SO CLOSE TO SOMETHING

984
00:46:41,866 --> 00:46:43,434
THAT YOU CAN'T SEE IT.

985
00:46:43,434 --> 00:46:45,169
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T SEE
THE FOREST THROUGH THE BEES.

986
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:47,938
- IT'S TREES,
AND THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

987
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:51,142
- WHATEVER.

988
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:53,444
EW! WHAT'S THIS?

989
00:46:53,444 --> 00:46:57,148
- OH, THAT'S A POSTER
THAT WE GOT HIM AT A SWAP MEET.

990
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:59,650
IT WAS AFTER...

991
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,319
ANDY WAS ALMOST 5.

992
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,888
HE HAD TO HAVE IT.

993
00:47:03,888 --> 00:47:05,156
I THOUGHT IT WAS
TOO FRIGHTENING,

994
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:06,390
BUT DONALD THOUGHT
IT WAS OKAY.

995
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,462
- ANDY, NO WONDER
YOU HAVE NIGHTMARES.

996
00:47:11,462 --> 00:47:14,465
I MEAN, ALL THOSE GREEN GUYS
ARE SCARY.

997
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:16,067
- HE STARES AT IT A LOT.

998
00:47:16,067 --> 00:47:18,436
SOMETIMES I THINK
HE TALKS TO THEM.

999
00:47:18,436 --> 00:47:20,438
- WHAT DO YOU SAY TO 'EM,
ANDY?

1000
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,514
- [groaning]

1001
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:41,392
- IT'S OKAY, ANDY.

1002
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:43,594
COME ON. TELL ME
WHAT YOU SAY TO 'EM.

1003
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:47,631
- AH.

1004
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:51,936
[groaning]

1005
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,509
- THIS ISN'T WORKING, PEPPER.

1006
00:47:58,509 --> 00:48:00,511
WE NEED TO CALM HIM DOWN
BEFORE BED.

1007
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,979
NOT OVERSTIMULATE HIM.

1008
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:04,682
COME ON, HONEY.
LET'S GET IN BED.

1009
00:48:04,682 --> 00:48:06,584
TIME TO GO TO SLEEP.

1010
00:48:06,584 --> 00:48:08,686
- I'M SORRY.
JUST TRYING TO HELP.

1011
00:48:08,686 --> 00:48:10,187
- I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING
TO HELP,

1012
00:48:10,187 --> 00:48:11,956
BUT I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR A LONG TIME.

1013
00:48:11,956 --> 00:48:13,190
AND I KNOW WHAT WORKS.

1014
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,558
IN YOU GO.

1015
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:23,334
OKAY, JUST SHUT YOUR EYES.

1016
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:25,302
[sighs]

1017
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:26,971
OKAY, SWEETIE.

1018
00:48:26,971 --> 00:48:30,007
RELAX.
EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

1019
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:44,755
- I LOVE FOOT MASSAGES.

1020
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:48,459
- ACUPRESSURE POINTS.

1021
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:53,030
SHUT YOUR EYES, SWEETIE.

1022
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:56,667
PEPPER, THIS ISN'T HELPING.

1023
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:01,105
- LOOKS PRETTY RELAXED TO ME.

1024
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:06,410
- OKAY, JUST BREATHE,

1025
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,379
AND LET ALL THAT ENERGY OUT.

1026
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:11,382
JUST LISTEN TO
THE CALMING SOUNDS,

1027
00:49:11,382 --> 00:49:14,151
AND LET THEM FLOW
THROUGH YOUR BODY.

1028
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:16,053
[sniffs]

1029
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:17,354
[blows]

1030
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,560
[blows]

1031
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:26,697
AND LET THEM CARRY AWAY
ALL THAT ENERGY.

1032
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:27,998
[synthesizer pulse]

1033
00:49:30,034 --> 00:49:33,337
- OH, WOW.
[laughs]

1034
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:34,405
THERE WAS THIS ONE DANCE

1035
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:36,440
THAT I USED TO DO AT THE CLUB.

1036
00:49:40,044 --> 00:49:42,446
MM. YOU KNOW THAT SONG
"SEXUAL HEALING"?

1037
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:47,551
- CLOSE YOUR EYES.

00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:49,740
- YOU KNOW, PEPPER,

1207
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,608
WHOEVER TOLD YOU
YOU WEREN'T SMART

1208
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:52,709
WAS STUPID.

1209
00:56:56,847 --> 00:56:57,948
[clinking]
[hissing]

1210
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:00,951
- HERE YOU GO.
- MUCH OBLIGED.

1211
00:57:00,951 --> 00:57:02,152
- MY PLEASURE.

1212
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:03,887
[microwave dings]
- SO, JARVIS...

1213
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:04,888
WHAT DO YOU THINK
GRANDMA MOODY WOULD SAY

1214
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:06,657
ABOUT ONE OF THESE THINGS?

1215
00:57:06,657 --> 00:57:08,792
- SHE'D SAY NOBODY CAN
WAIT FOR NOTHING NO MORE.

1216
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:10,594
- WELL, THEN SHE'D BE RIGHT.

1217
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:13,597
- WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE BARBECUE THEM BABIES?

1218
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:14,931
- BARBECUE?

1219
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,834
- THE FLAVOR OF A STEAK
OVER AN OPEN FLAME.

1220
00:57:17,834 --> 00:57:19,536
YOU GOT ONE IN THE BACKYARD,
DON'T YOU?

1221
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:20,837
- YEAH.

1222
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:23,740
WE JUST DON'T
USE IT VERY MUCH.

1223
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,175
[microwave motor humming]

1224
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:29,212
- THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL.

1225
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:31,248
- I TOOK THAT
ON OUR HONEYMOON.

1226
00:57:31,248 --> 00:57:33,050
- YOU TOOK IT?

1227
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:34,885
YOU MEAN,
WITH YOUR CAMERA?

1228
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:38,088
- YEAH, PHOTOGRAPHY USED TO
BE SORT OF A HOBBY OF MINE.

1229
00:57:38,088 --> 00:57:40,891
- WELL, IT SURE LOOKS
REAL PROFESSIONAL TO ME.

1230
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:42,893
I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE
I'M THERE.

1231
00:57:42,893 --> 00:57:46,129
- IT WAS A REALLY NICE PLACE
TO BE.

1232
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:49,566
[sighs]

1233
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,234
MAYBE I NEED A BOOB JOB.

1234
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:54,671
OR A TUMMY TUCK
OR AN ASS LIFT.

1235
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:56,039
I USED TO HAVE A GREAT ASS.

1236
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:58,275
- YOU KNOW, I ALMOST GOT
A BOOB JOB ONCE.

1237
00:57:58,275 --> 00:57:59,843
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

1238
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:01,278
THIS GUY I USED TO DANCE FOR--

1239
00:58:01,278 --> 00:58:03,113
OOF! WHAT A PIG HE WAS.

1240
00:58:03,113 --> 00:58:04,781
ANYWAY, HE TOLD ME
I COULD HEADLINE

1241
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:06,583
IF I WAS JUST A COUPLE SIZES
BIGGER.

1242
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:08,285
- AND WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM?

1243
00:58:08,285 --> 00:58:10,654
- WELL, I TOLD HIM IF HE WAS
READY TO GET SOME SILICONE

1244
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:13,123
INJECTED INTO HIS DICK
THAT I WOULD DO IT.

1245
00:58:13,123 --> 00:58:14,624
[laughs]
- HE MUST HAVE LOVED THAT.

1246
00:58:14,624 --> 00:58:16,693
- OH YEAH, HE FIRED MY ASS.

1247
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:18,261
SO THE SAME DAY I WENT OUT,

1248
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:20,030
AND I GOT THIS.

1249
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,600
- "KISS MY ASS"?

1250
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,136
[laughs]
WHOO! I LOVE IT!

1251
00:58:26,136 --> 00:58:27,571
[clanking]

1252
00:58:27,571 --> 00:58:28,605
- WHOA!

1253
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:32,275
- HASN'T BEEN USED IN A WHILE.

1254
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:37,581
[flames blowing]

1255
00:58:37,581 --> 00:58:38,915
- IT WILL HEAT UP
IN NO TIME.

1256
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:40,050
- YEAH.

1257
00:58:50,227 --> 00:58:53,296
- SO, WHAT DO YOU DO,
DONALD?

1258
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:54,831
- YOU MEAN, WHEN I'M NOT COOKING
STEAKS

1259
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:56,166
FOR PEOPLE WHO CRASH LAND
ON MY ROOF?

1260
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:57,267
- YEP.

1261
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:59,035
- I'M A CORPORATE LAWYER.

1262
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:01,271
IMPRESSED?

1263
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:03,006
- DOESN'T GET YOUR SPURS
KICKING, HUH?

1264
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:06,610
- LATELY, I NEED SPURS TO
KICK MYSELF AWAKE.

1265
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:09,913
THESE DAYS, THE THING
I CARE ABOUT THE MOST IS SLEEP.

1266
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:13,016
- I'M NOT SO SURE THAT'S
WHAT THE GOOD LORD HAD IN MIND

1267
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:14,651
WHEN HE CREATED THE WORLD.

1268
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:16,686
- YOUR WORLD AND MY WORLD

1269
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:18,855
ARE 2 ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PLACES.

1270
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:25,295
I USED TO CARE ABOUT
A LOT OF THINGS.

1271
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:28,665
[sizzling]

1272
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:31,301
- FASTER, DADDY!
FASTER!

1273
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:33,837
FASTER, DADDY, FASTER!
- ARMS UP! ARMS UP!

1274
00:59:33,837 --> 00:59:38,208
OKAY, COME ON, ANDY.
MOVE THROUGH THE BLUE.

1275
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:40,377
THAT'S IT.
- MOVE INTO THE BLUE.

1276
00:59:40,377 --> 00:59:42,012
- COME ON, KICK.

1277
00:59:42,012 --> 00:59:45,148
KICK. USE YOUR ARMS.
USE YOUR ARMS.

1278
00:59:45,148 --> 00:59:47,050
COME ON, ANDY.
USE YOUR HANDS.

1279
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:50,720
REMEMBER HOW I TAUGHT YOU?
THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT.

1280
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,723
THAT A BOY.
SWIM WITH YOUR HANDS.

1281
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:56,126
[splashing]

1282
00:59:56,126 --> 00:59:58,028
USE YOUR HANDS, ANDY,
LIKE I TOLD YOU.

1283
00:59:58,028 --> 01:00:02,299
THAT A BOY.
MOVING THROUGH THE BLUE.

1284
01:00:02,299 --> 01:00:05,335
LOOK AT THIS!
- YOU'RE DOING GREAT!

1285
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:07,137
OH, THAT'S GOOD, ANDY.
- LOOK AT HIM!

1286
01:00:07,137 --> 01:00:09,406
- THAT'S GREAT!
- LOOK AT HIM GO.

1287
01:00:09,406 --> 01:00:12,742
KEEP THOSE ARMS GOING.
HE'S MY OLYMPIC SWIMMER.

1288
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:15,312
[laughs]
- SMILE! LOOK AT MOMMY.

1289
01:00:15,312 --> 01:00:17,848
ANDY, ARE YOU GONNA BE
MOMMY'S CHAMPION?

1290
01:00:17,848 --> 01:00:19,749
- NO, HE'S GOING TO BE
DADDY'S CHAMPION.

1291
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:22,285
- I WANT TO BE MOMMY
AND DADDY'S CHAMPION.

1292
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:25,288
- [laughs]
- GOOD ANSWER.

1293
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:28,191
- HOW HIGH CAN YOU GO?
[laughs]

1294
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:29,793
- GOOD!
- [laughs]

1295
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:31,061
- HERE, LET'S TAKE A PICTURE.

1296
01:00:31,061 --> 01:00:32,929
- OKAY, TURN AND LOOK
AT ME, BABY.

1297
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:35,031
- HERE WE GO.
WHOO!

1298
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:36,933
- AH, THAT'S A BEAUTY.

1299
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:49,045
- OH, MY GREAT GRANDDADDY
ALWAYS USED TO SAY

1300
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:51,348
"IT'S A LUCKY MAN WHO
LOOKS FORWARD TO

1301
01:00:51,348 --> 01:00:53,817
"GOING TO WORK IN THE MORNING.

1302
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:56,953
"AND AN EVEN LUCKIER ONE WHO
LOOKS FORWARD TO GOING HOME."

1303
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:58,455
- WHAT WOULD YOUR
GREAT GRANDDADDY SAY

1304
01:00:58,455 --> 01:01:00,323
ABOUT A MAN WHO DOESN'T
DO EITHER?

1305
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:04,728
- [smacks lips] HE'D FEEL
DOWNRIGHT SAD FOR THAT MAN.

1306
01:01:04,728 --> 01:01:07,998
BUT HE'D ALSO SAY THERE AIN'T
NO REASON TO FEE SAD

1307
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:10,700
FOR A MAN WHO FEELS
THAT SAD FOR HIMSELF.

1308
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:35,292
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1309
01:01:35,292 --> 01:01:37,060
- I WORE THIS FOR MY FIRST DAY

1310
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:39,963
AS A CLERK FOR THE PUBLIC
DEFENDER...WITH A BLAZER.

1311
01:01:39,963 --> 01:01:41,898
- OH, WELL, I HOPE YOUR BOSS
APPRECIATED IT.

1312
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:43,233
- [sighs]
WE LOST THE CASE.

1313
01:01:43,233 --> 01:01:44,467
- JUSTICE IS BLIND.

1314
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:48,438
- BUT I MET DONALD.
- LOVE IS NOT.

1315
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:51,107
- YOU KNOW, I THINK THIS ONE
IS TOO BORING.

1316
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:53,310
- OH, YEAH.

1317
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:55,445
ALICE, I THINK THIS IS
THE ONE.

1318
01:01:55,445 --> 01:01:57,414
- I WILL NEVER GET THIS ON.

1319
01:01:57,414 --> 01:01:58,982
- I PROMISE YOU ONE THING--

1320
01:01:58,982 --> 01:02:01,885
IF YOU GET THIS ON,
YOU WILL GET IT ON.

1321
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:03,420
COME ON! PUT IT ON!

1322
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:08,091
[giggling]

1323
01:02:11,161 --> 01:02:13,196
- WHAT ARE YOU BOYS
DOING OUT HERE?

1324
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:15,365
- WELL, WELL, WELL!

1325
01:02:15,365 --> 01:02:19,169
STEP RIGHT THIS WAY,
DARLINGS.

1326
01:02:19,169 --> 01:02:21,338
- YOU'RE BARBECUING.

1327
01:02:21,338 --> 01:02:24,808
- JARVIS SAID THEY TASTE BETTER,
AND HE'S THE GUEST.

1328
01:02:24,808 --> 01:02:26,209
- WELL, I'M AMAZED THIS THING
STILL WORKS.

1329
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:28,345
- JUST NEEDED A LITTLE
TENDER LOVING CARE.

1330
01:02:28,345 --> 01:02:30,313
- WELL, DON'T WE ALL.

1331
01:02:34,184 --> 01:02:35,452
- I REMEMBER YOU.

1332
01:02:37,354 --> 01:02:39,189
- IT'S NICE TO BE REMEMBERED.

1333
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:47,163
[clinking]

1334
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:51,468
- MMM. FABULOUS.

1335
01:02:51,468 --> 01:02:53,303
- THIS IS SO GOOD.

1336
01:02:53,303 --> 01:02:56,339
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
THERE'S LIKE THIS PERFECT MOMENT

1337
01:02:56,339 --> 01:02:58,174
WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE
AND THE RIGHT PLACE.

1338
01:02:58,174 --> 01:02:59,909
- AND THE RIGHT FOOD.

1339
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:01,578
WHY IS IT THAT THE THINGS
THAT ARE THE WORST FOR US

1340
01:03:01,578 --> 01:03:03,213
ALWAYS TASTE THE BEST?

1341
01:03:03,213 --> 01:03:05,015
- ASKED ADAM TO EVE.

1342
01:03:05,015 --> 01:03:07,317
- OH, WELL, SEE THERE'S
A STORY THAT I NEVER BELIEVED.

1343
01:03:07,317 --> 01:03:09,019
I MEAN, IF GOD DIDN'T WANT
THEM TO EAT THE APPLE,

1344
01:03:09,019 --> 01:03:11,254
WHY WOULD HAVE MADE
A TREE GROW FRUIT?

1345
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:13,089
- PEPPER, YOU'RE A THEOLOGIAN.

1346
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:14,624
- WELL, THESE DAYS THEY WOULDN'T
HAVE SURVIVED ANYWAY.

1347
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,493
TOO MANY PESTICIDES
ON THE APPLE.

1348
01:03:16,493 --> 01:03:19,195
- WELL, I JUST DON'T BELIEVE
IN FEELING GUILTY

1349
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:20,497
ABOUT WHAT FEELS GOOD.

1350
01:03:20,497 --> 01:03:23,099
- AS GRANDMA MOODY
ALWAYS USED TO SAY

1351
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:26,036
"AN OCCASIONAL ANYTHING
WON'T KILL YOU,

1352
01:03:26,036 --> 01:03:29,072
"UNLESS IT'S AN OCCASIONAL
BULLET TO THE HEAD."

1353
01:03:29,072 --> 01:03:32,008
[all laugh]

1354
01:03:32,008 --> 01:03:33,043
- WANT TO KNOW WHAT ELSE
BUGS ME?

1355
01:03:33,043 --> 01:03:35,612
- WHAT?
- SUN.

1356
01:03:35,612 --> 01:03:38,248
- EXCUSE ME?
- WELL, THE SUN.

1357
01:03:38,248 --> 01:03:40,283
BECAUSE, SEE, THE SUN
WILL SHINE DOWN

1358
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:43,086
ON PLACES LIKE,
I DON'T KNOW, ETHIOPIA, RIGHT,

1359
01:03:43,086 --> 01:03:45,255
WHERE IT'S ALL DRY
AND CRACKED,

1360
01:03:45,255 --> 01:03:46,489
AND IT DOESN'T GROW FOOD
ANYWHERE,

1361
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,091
AND PEOPLE ARE STARVING
AND DYING.

1362
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:49,926
BUT AT THE SAME TIME
THE SUN SHINES DOWN

1363
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:51,461
ON A PLACE LIKE HAWAII WHERE
PEOPLE ARE GETTING SUN TANS

1364
01:03:51,461 --> 01:03:53,063
AND DRINKING MAI TAIS.

1365
01:03:53,063 --> 01:03:55,498
IT JUST, WELL,
IT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR.

1366
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,036
IT'S THE SAME SUN.

1367
01:04:04,374 --> 01:04:05,909
- THE SAME SUN.

1368
01:04:05,909 --> 01:04:07,243
- [laughs]

1369
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:09,446
- [smacks lips]

1370
01:04:09,446 --> 01:04:11,247
- [clanking]

1371
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:14,117

01:04:24,928 --> 01:04:27,030
- HAIL TO THE CHEF.
- OH, NO, NO, NO.

1374
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:29,232
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT THE BRILLIANT ASSISTANCE

1375
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:31,668
OF GRANDMA MOODY'S
FAVORITE DISCIPLE JARVIS.

1376
01:04:31,668 --> 01:04:33,503
- IT WAS NOTHING.

1377
01:04:33,503 --> 01:04:35,972
- OH, BUNNY, NOW I WANT YOU
TO STOP THAT, OKAY.

1378
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:37,240
[sighs]
HE ALWAYS DOES THIS.

1379
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:38,708
HE NEVER TAKES CREDIT
FOR ANYTHING.

1380
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,344
HIS COMPANY, IT'S LIKE
ON TOP OF THAT LIST.

1381
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:44,114
YOU KNOW, UM,
OH, THE BUSINESS LIST.

1382
01:04:44,114 --> 01:04:46,049
THE MAGAZINE?
- FORTUNE 500.

1383
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:47,250
- YEAH, THAT'S THE ONE.

1384
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,119
WELL, HE NEVER TAKES CREDIT
FOR IT.

1385
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:50,620
HE THINKS HE HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

1386
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,422
- WELL, BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME
BEFORE I GOT HERE,

1387
01:04:52,422 --> 01:04:54,991
AND IT WILL BE AROUND
A LONG TIME AFTER I'M GONE.

1388
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:57,060
- SO, IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU DON'T MATTER AT ALL?

1389
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,662
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
- YOU DIDN'T NEED TO.

1390
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:01,131
COME ON, JARVIS.

1391
01:05:01,131 --> 01:05:02,532
IN MOST GUYS, HUMILITY
IS A VIRTUE.

1392
01:05:02,532 --> 01:05:04,033
IN YOU, IT'S ARMOR.

1393
01:05:06,035 --> 01:05:08,738
- ARE WE GONNA EAT, OR WE GONNA
GET ALL PSYCHOLOGICAL HERE?

1394
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,673
- YOU KNOW, I THINK
DONALD'S RIGHT.

1395
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:12,575
I MEAN, YOU RUN WHAT SOUNDS LIKE

1396
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,611
ONE OF THE BIGGEST INSURANCE
COMPANIES IN THE COUNTRY.

1397
01:05:14,611 --> 01:05:16,212
- MORE LIKE THE WHOLE WORLD.

1398
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:17,714
- AND YOU MAKE IT SOUND
LIKE A LEMONADE STAND.

1399
01:05:17,714 --> 01:05:19,149
- WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE HE
DOESN'T FEEL

1400
01:05:19,149 --> 01:05:20,350
HE EARNED IT, RIGHT?

1401
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:23,119
BUT YOU DID EARN IT, BUNNY.
YOU DID.

1402
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,522
BEING BORN INTO IT,
LIVING IT-- THAT'S EARNING IT.

1403
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:29,359
- HOW ABOUT THAT SPARRING MATCH?

1404
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:31,461
- NOW? WE'RE EATING.

1405
01:05:31,461 --> 01:05:33,029
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WAIT
A HALF AN HOUR.

1406
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:34,130
- WELL, THAT'S SWIMMING.

1407
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,365
- WHAT'S SPARRING?

1408
01:05:35,365 --> 01:05:37,534
[punches]
[grunting]

1409
01:05:39,736 --> 01:05:41,771
- CHARMING, HUH?

1410
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:44,340
- NOW WHY WOULD TWO GROWN MEN
WHO LIKE EACH OTHER

1411
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:46,176
WANT TO BEAT EACH OTHER
TO A PULP?

1412
01:05:46,176 --> 01:05:48,111
- BECAUSE THEY CAN'T
HAVE BABIES.

1413

[grunting]

1414
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:55,051

1415
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:57,754
- YOU KNOW, ALICE,
DONALD'S IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE.

1416
01:05:57,754 --> 01:06:01,257
- HE GIVES NEW MEANING TO
OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR.

1417
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:03,693
- YEAH, WELL, YOU HAVE
YOUR GOOD OBSESSIONS

1418
01:06:03,693 --> 01:06:05,495
AND YOUR BAD OBSESSIONS.

1419
01:06:05,495 --> 01:06:07,564
- AH!

1420
01:06:07,564 --> 01:06:10,099
- JARVIS DOESN'T LOOK
TOO BAD HIMSELF.

1421
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:11,634
- YOU HEAR THAT, BUNNY?

1422
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:15,038
ALICE THINKS YOU'RE A HUNK!
[laughs]

1423
01:06:15,038 --> 01:06:16,539
- OOH!

1424

1426
01:06:22,212 --> 01:06:25,081

THIS BROKEN DOWN COWBOY

1427
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:26,115
NEVER RIDES AGAIN!

1428
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:27,417
- NO, I JUST WANT TO SEE

1429
01:06:27,417 --> 01:06:29,052
IF THAT INSURANCE OF YOURS
PAYS OFF.

1430
01:06:29,052 --> 01:06:31,354
[punch]
- OOH!

1431
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:34,390
[heavy breathing]

1432
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:36,426
- I HAVEN'T HAD
THIS MUCH FUN SINCE COLLEGE.

1433
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:39,329
- WELL, FINE. I WON'T TAKE
THAT PERSONALLY.

1434
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:41,030
[heavy breathing]

1435
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:46,069
- WANT A JOB, DONALD?
- WHAT?

1436
01:06:46,069 --> 01:06:47,337
- A JOB!

1437
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:49,105
ANY LAWYER WITH FOOTWORK
LIKE YOURS,

1438
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:50,807
I WANT ON MY SIDE.

1439
01:06:50,807 --> 01:06:53,576
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- SERIOUS AS A BULL IN A CHUTE.

1440
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:55,712
[hard punch]
- OOH!

1441
01:06:55,712 --> 01:06:57,046
- OUCH!

1442
01:06:58,348 --> 01:07:00,283
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

1443
01:07:00,283 --> 01:07:01,384
- BECAUSE I CAN.

1444
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:04,621
[punch]
- OH! GOD!

1445
01:07:04,621 --> 01:07:07,123
- HELL OF AN INTERVIEW PROCESS,
JARVIS.

1446
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:08,391
- BRAVO!
[clapping]

1447
01:07:08,391 --> 01:07:10,760
[kissing sounds]
- OH!

1448
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,228
HE GOT ME.
- YOU OKAY? YEAH.

1449
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:14,130
WELL, YOU'RE BLEEDING A LITTLE.
- JESUS.

1450
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:15,732
ARE YOU SURE THERE'S NO LISTING

1451
01:07:15,732 --> 01:07:18,167
IN AUSTIN, HOUSTON OR DALLAS?

1452
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:20,536
YEAH, OKAY, KELLY.
THANKS.

1453
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:23,239
NO, NO. WE'RE FINE.
YEAH, I WILL.

1454
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:24,674
WHAT DID I TELL YOU.

1455
01:07:24,674 --> 01:07:27,377
NOT ONLY IS THERE NO NUMBER
ON THE CARD,

1456
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:28,778
BUT KELLY SAYS THERE'S
NO LISTING

1457
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:31,247
FOR A JARVIS MOODY
OR UNIGLOBE LIFE

1458
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:32,582
ANYWHERE IN TEXAS.

1459
01:07:32,582 --> 01:07:33,783
- SO?

1460
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:35,685
COME ON, RAGING BULL.
SIT DOWN.

1461
01:07:35,685 --> 01:07:37,654
AND I'LL FIX YOUR CUT.

1462
01:07:37,654 --> 01:07:40,823
- [sighs]
MAN. OH, MAN.

1463
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:44,527
I CAN'T BELIEVE I LET HIM
SUCKER PUNCH ME LIKE THAT.

1464
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:46,362
OW!
- SORRY.

1465
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:48,431
- I KNOW HE ONLY OFFERED ME
THAT JOB

1466
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:50,667
TO DISTRACT ME SO HE COULD
NAIL ME.

1467
01:07:50,667 --> 01:07:52,769
- OH, DONALD, YOU WEREN'T
PLAYING CHESS.

1468
01:07:52,769 --> 01:07:54,237
YOU WERE BOXING.

1469
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:55,672
PEOPLE GET HIT.

1470
01:07:55,672 --> 01:07:57,473
DON'T START GETTING PARANOID.

1471
01:07:57,473 --> 01:07:59,442
- I JUST DON'T TRUST
THE GUY, OKAY.

1472
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:00,543
- WELL, FINE.

1473
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:02,378
BUT WHOEVER THEY ARE

1474
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:05,148
I'M KIND OF ENJOYING MYSELF
THIS EVENING.

1475
01:08:05,148 --> 01:08:06,749
CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE
I'M SAYING THAT.

1476
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:09,619
IT'S BEEN SO LONG I CAN HARDLY
REMEMBER THE SENSATION.

1477
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:15,458
HERE.
BLEEDING STOPPED.

1478
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:18,227
- SO I WON'T NEED
THE TRANSFUSION?

1479
01:08:18,227 --> 01:08:20,396
- PERSONALITY TRANSPLANT,
MAYBE.

1480
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:26,102
- HAVE I TOLD YOU LATELY
YOU'RE AN AMAZING PERSON?

1481
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:29,472
- NO.

1482

01:13:14,123 --> 01:13:16,726
- HE HAD ANOTHER ONE
OF THOSE NIGHTMARES,

1544
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:18,961
AND YOU TWO WERE
OTHERWISE ENGAGED.

1545
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:21,631
SO, PEPPER WENT ON UP THERE
AND TOOK CARE OF IT.

1546
01:13:21,631 --> 01:13:23,199
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"TOOK CARE OF IT"?

1547
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:26,102
- TRUST PEPPER. SHE'S GOT A WAY
WITH YOUNG FOLKS.

1548
01:13:26,102 --> 01:13:28,004
- YEAH, SHE PRACTICALLY
IS ONE HERSELF.

1549
01:13:28,004 --> 01:13:29,972
- WELL, HOW LONG HAS
SHE BEEN UP THERE?

1550
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:31,841
- WELL, I CAN SEE YOU'RE
A BIT RILED.

1551
01:13:31,841 --> 01:13:35,478
BUT IT'S GOOD FOR ANDY
TO SPEND TIME WITH YOUNGSTERS,

1552
01:13:35,478 --> 01:13:37,914
ESPECIALLY WHEN HE'S GOING
TO THIS NEW SCHOOL.

1553
01:13:37,914 --> 01:13:39,682
- WHAT IS THIS?

1554
01:13:39,682 --> 01:13:41,484
A GODDAMN MALE CONSPIRACY?
- I DIDN'T SAY A WORD.

1555
01:13:41,484 --> 01:13:42,852
- WELL, HOW THE HELL DOES
HE KNOW? WHAT IS GOING ON?!

1556
01:13:42,852 --> 01:13:43,853
- I DON'T KNOW HOW THE HELL
HE KNOWS.

1557
01:13:43,853 --> 01:13:45,588
HOW THE HELL DID YOU KNOW?

1558
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:47,156
- I MUST HAVE HEARD
SOMETHING I SHOULDN'T HAVE.

1559
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:48,758
GRANDMA MOODY WAS
ALWAYS TELLING ME

1560
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:50,626
THERE'S 3 THINGS THE GOOD LORD
GAVE MAN,

AND 2 OF 'EM IS EARS.

1563
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:55,531
- ALICE, LOOK, HONEY.

1564
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:56,999
HE-- HE MIGHT ALREADY
BE ASLEEP.

1565
01:13:56,999 --> 01:13:58,567
YOU DON'T WANT TO
GO UP THERE AND WAKE HIM.

1566
01:14:01,137 --> 01:14:03,639
- SOUND ASLEEP, HUH?
ANDY!

1567
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:07,276
[tapping]

1568
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:10,046
- [whispers] OH, MY GOD.
THEY COULD FALL.

1569
01:14:12,982 --> 01:14:14,617
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

1570
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:15,985
SHE'S GOT HIM.

1571
01:14:20,089 --> 01:14:22,158
- THAT'S IT, ANDY.

1572
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:24,093
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

1573
01:14:26,262 --> 01:14:28,130
- DONALD, DO SOMETHING.

1574
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:29,932
- HE'S IN GOOD HANDS, ALICE.

1575
01:14:31,734 --> 01:14:34,704
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE A NATURAL DANCER.

1576
01:14:34,704 --> 01:14:36,839
JUST LIKE YOUR DADDY.

1577
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:47,483
HERE, PUT YOUR HAND
AROUND MY BACK.

1578
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:55,257
THAT'S RIGHT.

1579
01:14:55,257 --> 01:15:00,029
GIRLS LOVE TO BE HELD
JUST LIKE THAT.

1580
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:05,935
[birds tweeting]

1581
01:15:09,205 --> 01:15:12,241
[splashing]

1582
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:21,884
- WHAT YOU READING?

1583
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:23,719
- PEOPLE.

1584
01:15:23,719 --> 01:15:26,956
- HMM. CAN I HAVE A LICK?

1585
01:15:26,956 --> 01:15:28,824
[slurps]

1586
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:30,559
- [laughs]

1587
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:34,930
[kissing sounds]

1588
01:15:37,767 --> 01:15:39,335
- YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD KISSER.

1589
01:15:39,335 --> 01:15:42,671
I HAVE NEVER KISSED ANYBODY
WHO KISSES AS GOOD AS YOU.

1590
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:45,107
WOULD YOU PUT SOME OIL
ON MY BACK?

1591
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:46,242
- SURE.

1592
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:50,713
- DON'T WANT TO BURN.

1593
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:52,948
YOU KNOW, THAT WHOLE
OZONE LAYER THING.

1594
01:15:52,948 --> 01:15:55,551
- YEAH, I THINK I DID
A PROJECT ON THAT IN SCIENCE.

1595
01:15:57,953 --> 01:16:00,289
- [moans]

1596
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:02,024
I JUST WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND

1597
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:06,095
HOW SOMETHING THAT FEELS SO GOOD
CAN BE BAD FOR YOU.

1598
01:16:06,095 --> 01:16:07,096
- [laughs]

1599
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:17,206
- OH, ANDY, DON'T STOP.

1600
01:16:17,206 --> 01:16:19,708
YOU HAVE SUCH GREAT HANDS.

1601
01:16:28,684 --> 01:16:30,820
- HMM? COOL TATTOO.

1602
01:16:35,224 --> 01:16:36,926
CAN I?

1603
01:16:38,894 --> 01:16:40,830
- IT'D BE MY PLEASURE.

1604
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:45,267
[splashing]

1605
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:53,843
- I CAN'T WATCH THIS ANYMORE.

1606
01:16:53,843 --> 01:16:56,011
- WILL YOU CALM DOWN.
WE CAN'T STARTLE HIM.

1607
01:17:07,323 --> 01:17:09,992
IT-- IT'S OKAY, ANDY.

1608
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:12,194
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1609
01:17:12,194 --> 01:17:14,964
YOU LOOK REAL GOOD
DANCING UP THERE.

1610
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:18,000
BETTER THAN I COULD EVER DO.

1611
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,869
OKAY, ANDY, COME HERE.

1612
01:17:19,869 --> 01:17:22,271
COME ON. LET'S GO INSIDE NOW.

1613
01:17:22,271 --> 01:17:24,707
ANDY.
- ANDY?

1614
01:17:24,707 --> 01:17:26,942
HONEY, WHY DON'T YOU COME
ON BACK TO ME, OKAY?

1615
01:17:26,942 --> 01:17:29,912
COME ON. I WANT TO DANCE
WITH YOU SOME MORE.

1616
01:17:29,912 --> 01:17:32,781
- SON, I NEED YOU
TO TAKE MY HAND.

1617
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:35,117
- DONALD, GET HIM.

1618
01:17:39,255 --> 01:17:41,790
- ANDY.

1619
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:42,892
LET'S GO INSIDE, HONEY.

1620
01:17:42,892 --> 01:17:44,293
- TAKE MY HAND, SON.
COME ON.

1621
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:46,962
- WATCH IT.
- ANDY! DON'T! DON'T!

1622
01:17:46,962 --> 01:17:49,131
DON'T BACK UP!

1623
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:51,166
[shuffling]
ANDY!

1624
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:54,303
[screams]
ANDY!

1625
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:55,337
[shuffling]

1626
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:57,373
- [groaning]

1627
01:17:57,373 --> 01:17:59,041
- [sighs]

1628
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:01,443
[cries]

1629
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:03,712
- [breathing heavily]

1630
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:11,253
- [sighs]
THAT WAS AMAZING, PEPPER.

1631
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:13,055
- OH, IT WAS PROBABLY
ALL MY YEARS OF AEROBICS.

1632
01:18:13,055 --> 01:18:15,057
I USED TO TEACH AT
THE HOLIDAY SPA IN ANAHEIM.

1633
01:18:15,057 --> 01:18:16,992
- OH, STEP CLASS IS ONE THING.

1634
01:18:16,992 --> 01:18:18,060
BUT THE WAY YOU JUST

1635
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:20,296
REACHED OUT AND GRABBED HIM.

1636
01:18:20,296 --> 01:18:22,765
- ALICE, IT WAS NOTHING.
REALLY.

1637
01:18:22,765 --> 01:18:23,966
IT-- IT WAS KIND OF LIKE
THAT MOM

1638
01:18:23,966 --> 01:18:26,001
WHO LIFTED THE CAR
OFF HER BABY.

1639
01:18:26,001 --> 01:18:27,469
IT'S AMAZING THE THINGS
THAT WE CAN DO.

1640
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:29,138
- [sighs]

1641
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:32,508
I JUST DON'T KNOW
IF WE'LL EVER BE ABLE

1642
01:18:32,508 --> 01:18:34,543
TO DO ENOUGH TO THANK YOU.

1643
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,312
RIGHT, DONALD?
- RIGHT.

1644
01:18:38,247 --> 01:18:40,916
- WELL, DARLING, WE BEST
BE ON OUR WAY,

1645
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:43,819
OR THIS VALENTINE'S DAY
IS GONNA BE NOTHING BUT HISTORY.

1646
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:45,387
- [sighs]
OKAY.

1647
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:48,057
YOU DID PROMISE ME
VALENTINE'S DAY IN LAS VEGAS.

1648
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:50,492
AND YOU HAVEN'T BROKEN
A PROMISE TO ME YET.

1649
01:18:50,492 --> 01:18:53,095
[laughs]
[sighs]

1650
01:18:55,364 --> 01:18:58,968
GOODBYE, ANDY.
[kiss]

1651
01:18:58,968 --> 01:19:01,503
YOU KEEP DANCING, OKAY?

1652
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:03,038
- LET'S GET GOING

1653
01:19:03,038 --> 01:19:06,275
BEFORE FATHER TIME
MAKES A LIAR OUT OF ME.

1654
01:19:06,275 --> 01:19:07,409
- THANK YOU.

1655
01:19:16,452 --> 01:19:18,587
- OH, I'M SORRY. I WAS
JUST TRYING THESE ON--

1656
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:21,023
- NO, KEEP IT..

1657
01:19:21,023 --> 01:19:22,258
IT LOOKS GOOD ON YOU.

1658
01:19:25,027 --> 01:19:26,362
- THANK YOU.

1659
01:19:28,397 --> 01:19:30,165
HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY.

1660
01:19:30,165 --> 01:19:31,133
- YOU, TOO.

1661
01:19:37,172 --> 01:19:39,241
- COME ON, ANDY.
LET'S SAY GOODBYE TO OUR GUESTS.

1662
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:46,582
- DONALD.

1663
01:19:46,582 --> 01:19:48,851
- SO YOU'LL BE IN TOUCH
ABOUT THE ROOF?

1664
01:19:48,851 --> 01:19:50,252
- FIRST THING MONDAY MORNING.

1665
01:19:50,252 --> 01:19:51,954
- NOT THAT I HAVEN'T
GROWN TO LIKE IT.

1666
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:54,156
YOU KNOW, MAYBE...

1667
01:19:54,156 --> 01:19:56,425
 ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST 
WILL COME AND DO AN ARTICLE,

1668
01:19:56,425 --> 01:19:58,594
CALL IT "EARLY AIRPORT."

1669
01:19:58,594 --> 01:20:00,062
- [laughs]

1670
01:20:00,062 --> 01:20:01,630
FORTUNATELY, I THINK IT WILL
BE FIXED

1671
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,365
BEFORE YOU CAN START A TREND.

1672
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:05,134
- SWEETIE, GO ON UP TO BED.
I'LL BE RIGHT UP, OKAY.

1673
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:06,201
- JARVIS, I FORGET.

1674
01:20:06,201 --> 01:20:07,336
WHERE DID YOU SAY

1675
01:20:07,336 --> 01:20:09,004
YOUR COMPANY WAS LOCATED?

1676
01:20:09,004 --> 01:20:12,341
- AUSTIN.
- AUSTIN, THAT'S RIGHT.

1677
01:20:12,341 --> 01:20:14,109
- DONALD, PLEASE.
- NO, ALICE.

1678
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:18,013
THESE PEOPLE COME BY FOR
10 MINUTES TO DROP OFF GIFTS.

1679
01:20:18,013 --> 01:20:21,216
8 HOURS LATER THEY KNOW EVERY
INTIMATE DETAIL OF OUR LIVES,

1680
01:20:21,216 --> 01:20:22,317
AND WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THEM?

1681
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:24,019
- DONALD, WE JUST CAME TO BRING

1682
01:20:24,019 --> 01:20:25,421
A LITTLE VALENTINE'S DAY CHEER
INTO YOUR HOME,

1683
01:20:25,421 --> 01:20:27,489
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
YOU COULD USE.

1684
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:28,590
COME ON, BUNNY. LET'S GO.

1685
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:30,192
- AND, PEPPER,

1686
01:20:30,192 --> 01:20:32,194
WHERE THE HELL DID YOU
BECOME SO PERCEPTIVE?

1687
01:20:32,194 --> 01:20:33,462
WAS IT DANCING TOPLESS
IN FRONT OF

1688
01:20:33,462 --> 01:20:34,997
ALL THOSE HORNY CONVENTIONEERS?

1689
01:20:34,997 --> 01:20:37,066
- DONALD!
- HOLD IT RIGHT THERE, BUDDY!

1690
01:20:37,066 --> 01:20:39,101
- DONALD, DON'T DO THIS!
JUST LET 'EM GO!

1691
01:20:39,101 --> 01:20:41,136
- NO, ALICE, I GOT A FUCKING
HOLE IN MY ROOF!

1692
01:20:41,136 --> 01:20:43,439
AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF
IT'S EVER GONNA GET FIXED!

1693
01:20:43,439 --> 01:20:45,574
BECAUSE, YOU SEE, JARVIS
OLD BUDDY,

1694
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:48,677
THERE'S NO LISTING FOR YOU
OR YOUR COMPANY

1695
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:50,412
IN THE ENTIRE GREAT STATE
OF TEXAS.

1696
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:52,514
- THAT'S MY BUSINESS.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

1697
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:54,249
AND YOU DON'T OWE HIM ANYTHING.

1698
01:20:54,249 --> 01:20:56,385
- YOU'RE LIKE A RATTLER
CHOKING ON ITS OWN VENOM.

1699
01:20:56,385 --> 01:20:57,619
- OH, GOOD, ANOTHER FUCKING
PEARL OF WISDOM

1700
01:20:57,619 --> 01:20:59,354
FROM THE LATE-GREAT
GRANDMA MOODY.

1701
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:00,622
- LOOK, YOU CAN'T TALK
TO HIM THAT WAY!

1702
01:21:00,622 --> 01:21:02,324
- DONALD, COME ON!

1703
01:21:02,324 --> 01:21:04,026
- THIS IS MY HOUSE IN CASE
YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED!

1704
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:05,561
I CAN TALK ANY WAY I WANT!
- NO, YOU CAN'T.

1705
01:21:05,561 --> 01:21:07,663
THEY'RE OUR GUESTS.
- GUESTS! IS THAT WHAT THEY ARE?

1706
01:21:07,663 --> 01:21:10,065
- YES, AND IF YOU LET GO
OF THAT STUPID MALE PRIDE--

1707
01:21:10,065 --> 01:21:11,467
- OH, I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD
ANY OF THAT LEFT!

1708
01:21:11,467 --> 01:21:13,302
- INSTEAD OF BEING UPSET
THAT A STRANGER

1709
01:21:13,302 --> 01:21:14,570
SAVED OUR SON AND YOU DIDN'T,

1710
01:21:14,570 --> 01:21:16,138
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
