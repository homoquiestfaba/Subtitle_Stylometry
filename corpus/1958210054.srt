1
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:09,504
Are you ready?

2
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:13,073
We're ready.

3
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:16,243
Ready to forget,
once and for all.

4
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,580
Good, Mr. Lambert.

5
00:01:18,713 --> 00:01:21,749
So then, close your eyes.

6
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,619
Both of you.

7
00:01:26,054 --> 00:01:28,022
Now take a deep breath.

8
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:33,460
Now feel yourselves
getting sleepier and sleepier.

9
00:01:33,595 --> 00:01:37,599
Neither of you will remember
the last year.

10
00:01:37,732 --> 00:01:40,969
There is no place called
The Further.

11
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:45,607
You will only remember
Dalton's coma.

12
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,711
And his recovery.

13
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:52,312
And let the darkness drift

14
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:57,518
further and further away.

15
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:22,209
"For everything,
there is a season.

16
00:02:24,946 --> 00:02:26,714
"A time to be born

17
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:29,817
"and a time to die.

18
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,955
"A time to kill

19
00:02:35,056 --> 00:02:36,524
"and a time to heal.

20
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:40,193
"A time to keep

21
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,797
"and a time to throw away.

22
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,535
"A time to weep

23
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:49,704
"and a time to laugh.

24
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:57,377
"A time to mourn
and a time to dance.

25
00:02:58,813 --> 00:03:00,313
"A time for silence...

26
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:07,855
"...and a time to speak.

27
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:13,828
"A time for love
and a time to hate.

28
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,733
A time for war
and a time for peace."

29
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:19,834
Amen.

30
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:21,836
Amen.

31
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:31,546
We therefore commit
this body to the ground.

32
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:35,016
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,

33
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:36,383
dust to dust.

34
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:38,786
Amen.

35
00:03:51,032 --> 00:03:53,935
It was a beautiful service
for a beautiful grandma.

36
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:56,137
She loved
you guys so much.

37
00:03:57,505 --> 00:03:59,473
Your mother was
a fine friend, Josh.

38
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:01,042
Thank you.

39
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:03,211
I miss Grandma.

40
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,378
I know.
She misses you, too, Kali.

41
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:07,280
Dead people
don't miss anything.

42
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,518
Okay, that's-that's not true,
and she does miss you.

43
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:15,288
See you guys
next weekend, okay?

44
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,391
Dalton.

45
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:21,129
Dalton!

46
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,499
See what I mean?

47
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:27,135
He's just anxious
about leaving.

48
00:04:29,237 --> 00:04:31,205
For school next week.

49
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,441
I know. Yeah, uh-huh.

50
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:36,677
Um...

51
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,981
Thank you
for organizing all this.

52
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,016
I just haven't had
the bandwidth.

53
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:46,788
Why don't you drive him
to school?

54
00:04:46,921 --> 00:04:49,422
You have a few weeks until all
your students show up, right?

55
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:51,424
Nah, he-he-he wouldn't
want me to.

56
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:53,795
He's not the parent. You are.
I mean, if you don't want to,

57
00:04:53,928 --> 00:04:54,796
then that's
a different story,

58
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:55,830
but...
I... No, I can't.

59
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,233
Why?

60
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:03,671
Well...

61
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:12,013
It was just an idea.

62
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:14,615
Maybe s-some way that you guys
could connect, that's all.

63
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:16,150
You know,
he's gonna be gone soon,

64
00:05:16,284 --> 00:05:18,586
so, anyway, think about it.

65
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:24,292
Bye.

66
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:25,526
See you, man.

67
00:05:35,303 --> 00:05:36,737
Excuse me.

68
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:41,843
Excuse me. Hey.

69
00:05:43,945 --> 00:05:44,846
Do I know you?

70
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:48,616
I knew your mother.

71
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:49,884
Years ago.

72
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:54,121
Um, but w-we lost touch.

73
00:05:56,157 --> 00:05:57,457
What's your name?

74
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:01,696
Carl.

75
00:06:09,337 --> 00:06:11,371
Nice to meet you, Carl.

76
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,241
Appreciate you coming.
I'm sorry I grabbed you.

77
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,509
I got a lot on my mind.
I'm sure.

78
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:18,079
Death floods the mind
with memory.

79
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:21,849
But there's always
new ones to make, right?

80
00:06:23,084 --> 00:06:25,186
Yeah.
Bye, Josh.

81
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,580
Carl.

82
00:07:49,437 --> 00:07:51,605
What did you just tell me?

83
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:53,841
Well, just tell me, Dalton.

84
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:55,343
Change it?

85
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,777
Do you want a clean...

86
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:58,112
Do you want to keep
the same diaper on?

87
00:07:58,245 --> 00:07:59,213
Yeah?

88
00:07:59,347 --> 00:08:00,815
I tell you what.

89
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:03,684
We can clean... we can
just clean out the diaper,

90
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:06,287
and then put the same diaper
back on.

91
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,023
Would you like that?
Would you like that?

92
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,325
Okay, yeah, I'll do that then.

93
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:15,329
What kind of outfit
do you want?

94
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:22,169
What kind of outfit
do you want?

95
00:08:22,303 --> 00:08:24,438
Yeah? Well, tell me.

96
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:26,374
All you got to do
is talk to me.

97
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:29,877
Come on.

98
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:31,746

Why don't you
pick a bed?

138
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:53,033
Mom got you this, uh,
power station thing.

139
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:57,004
What do you got here?
You got, uh, two outlets,

140
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:59,674
USB port and, uh,
two jumper cables,

141
00:13:59,808 --> 00:14:01,643
which are useless.

00:14:16,825 --> 00:14:18,258
Okay.

145
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:25,032
You still need this?
Guess Mom put it in there.

146
00:14:30,638 --> 00:14:31,740
Whoa.

147
00:14:33,474 --> 00:14:36,076
This is intense.
This what you been working on?

148
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,379
Put it back.
No, it's really good.

149
00:14:39,514 --> 00:14:41,048
Did you do this from memory?

150
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:43,585
It's from a photo
I found at the house.

151
00:14:43,718 --> 00:14:46,053
Wow, looks like she's, uh...

152
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:48,188
Like she's hiding something?

153
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:50,023
That's what it feels like...

154
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:53,060
felt like,
the last few years.

155
00:14:54,128 --> 00:14:55,530
She had a tough go, you know,

156
00:14:55,663 --> 00:14:56,865
being a single mom.

157
00:14:58,566 --> 00:14:59,768
Yeah, yeah.

158
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,069
That's... yeah, that's tough.

159
00:15:12,514 --> 00:15:14,081
Guess I didn't make
the wall, huh?

160
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:19,621
I don't blame you.

161
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:23,257
You know, I'm sorry
I haven't been around lately.

162
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:27,662
Course, my dad wasn't
around at all, but...

163
00:15:28,563 --> 00:15:29,898
Could be a lot worse.

164
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:35,436
I've just been a little foggy
past few years.

165
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,237
I don't know, my brain just...

166
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:39,206
I just...

167
00:15:40,575 --> 00:15:44,411
haven't been able
to manage time for, uh,

168
00:15:44,546 --> 00:15:46,648
you and your brother
and sister.

169
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:49,082
Have you ever thought
about getting help?

170
00:15:51,485 --> 00:15:53,020
I'm just trying
to push through.

171
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:59,627
Are you Dalton Lambert?
Yeah. Are-are you...

172
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:01,962
Chris Winslow. Mm.

173
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,167
Everything cool, fellas?

174
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:08,837
Yeah, no, everything's fine.

175
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:12,439
I just-- I thought my roommate
would be a, um, um...

176
00:16:12,574 --> 00:16:13,808
A-A guy.

177
00:16:13,942 --> 00:16:15,342
Yeah.
Yeah.

178
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:16,977
Oh.

179
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,079
I just figured
it's a liberal arts school,

180
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:20,615
and we mean "liberal."

181
00:16:20,748 --> 00:16:22,884
Yeah, pr-probably just confused
by the name Chris.

182
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:23,984
Right.

183
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:25,118
'Cause that would never happen

184
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:27,020
with a name like Dalton.

185
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:28,590
You know, I'm gonna go down

186
00:16:28,723 --> 00:16:30,658
to the housing office
and get this all sorted out.

187
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:31,860
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

188
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:33,327
Please, Father of Dalton.

189
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,696
Allow me.

190
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:37,498
I clearly interrupted
some... boy bonding.

191
00:16:37,632 --> 00:16:39,199
I'll be back.

192
00:16:44,506 --> 00:16:48,175
Hey, uh,
I snagged this for you.

193
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:49,677
You should check it out.

194
00:16:49,811 --> 00:16:51,513
If you hate it, no worries,

195
00:16:51,646 --> 00:16:53,213
but you're not gonna hate it.

196
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:57,317
You really don't know me,
do you?

197
00:16:57,451 --> 00:17:00,855
I mean, you really think
I want to join a frat?

198
00:17:00,989 --> 00:17:03,323
It's just a party, Dalton.

199
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:05,325
Go. Have fun.

200
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,361
I mean, do it for me.
I drove you here.

201
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:09,363
You didn't even want to.
Course I did.

202
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:11,833
Stop lying to me!

203
00:17:11,966 --> 00:17:13,768
I-I heard what Mom said
at the funeral.

204
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:16,036
Well, I still did it.

205
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:18,038
Oh, so that makes you
father of the year now?

206
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,073
At least you've got a father.
Stop blaming your dad

207
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,475
for the shit
that you screwed up.

208
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:24,411
He left like 40 years ago.
Get over it.

209
00:17:24,546 --> 00:17:26,113
God knows I'm not gonna be
defined by you.

210
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:28,950
Are you kidding me?
After all we have done for you?

211
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:31,886
When did you become
this ungrateful little shit?!

212
00:17:34,856 --> 00:17:36,356
No wonder Mom divorced you.

213
00:17:37,525 --> 00:17:38,927
Thanks for the ride.

214
00:17:58,713 --> 00:17:59,981
Excuse me.

215
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,524
Want me to take that?
Yeah.

216
00:18:09,657 --> 00:18:11,425
Here, I got it.
Thank you.

217
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:33,041
You can tell
it's Shania Twain, right?

218
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,142
Yeah.

219
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,811
So, what'd they say at housing?

220
00:19:36,944 --> 00:19:38,846
They said, "Tough titties."

221
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,648
I got to sleep here tonight.

222
00:19:40,782 --> 00:19:42,016
But I'll get
a new room tomorrow,

223
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,785
so it's not a permanent thing.

224
00:19:43,918 --> 00:19:45,053
Heartbreak, right?

225
00:19:46,721 --> 00:19:48,523
You're in the art school,
I take it?
Yeah.

226
00:19:48,656 --> 00:19:50,357
Are you music?
Math.

227
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,292
I thought about music,
but the artist's life

228
00:19:52,426 --> 00:19:55,163
is one of nomadic instability
and much gnashing of teeth.

229
00:19:56,664 --> 00:19:58,498
But I'm sure
you'll be super successful.

230
00:20:01,002 --> 00:20:03,270
You want to blow my hooter?
What?

231
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:04,906
Do you play?

232
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:05,907
Oh.

233
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,575
Uh, just-just a little piano.

234
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:08,676
It's the same thing.

235
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,243
Just blow.

236
00:20:13,948 --> 00:20:15,382
My cooties are good cooties.

237
00:20:28,629 --> 00:20:29,731
What's that?

238
00:20:29,864 --> 00:20:31,799
It's just something
my mom wrote.

239
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:33,400
Sweet.

240
00:20:35,203 --> 00:20:38,706
So, what's some weird shit
about you?

241
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:42,910
I don't know.

242
00:20:43,044 --> 00:20:45,613
"Uh, I don't know."

243
00:20:45,747 --> 00:20:47,048
Come on, man.

244
00:20:47,181 --> 00:20:48,482
Everybody's weird.

245
00:20:48,616 --> 00:20:50,084
Y-You first.

246
00:20:50,218 --> 00:20:51,652
On Sundays, I wear a monocle

247
00:20:51,786 --> 00:20:53,320
and I order takeout
with a British accent.

248
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:56,057
That is weird.
Thank you.

249
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:00,027
Okay, sometimes I eat
instant oatmeal,

250
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:03,396
uh, with no, like, water
or milk or anything.

251
00:21:03,531 --> 00:21:05,566
It's just kind of dry.

252
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,168
You're bad at this.

253
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,170
Let's try again.

254
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:11,072
When I was ten,
my parents died,

255
00:21:11,205 --> 00:21:12,874
and I went to go live
with my Grandma Perkee,

256
00:21:13,007 --> 00:21:14,374
who once went
almost nearly blind

257
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:16,778
from a gnarly case
of athlete's foot.

258
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:21,115
I don't remember
when I was ten.

259
00:21:22,116 --> 00:21:24,185
Like, the whole year.

260
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:25,352
What do you mean?

261
00:21:27,088 --> 00:21:30,124
I was in a coma.
Viral meningitis.

262
00:21:30,258 --> 00:21:31,759
At least
that's what they told me

263
00:21:31,893 --> 00:21:34,095
the few times
that they would talk about it.

264
00:21:34,228 --> 00:21:37,464
But I don't remember anything.

265
00:21:37,598 --> 00:21:39,332
I don't even remember
being sick.

266
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:44,138
It's like I woke up one day
and a whole year had passed.

267
00:21:45,438 --> 00:21:46,473
That's awful.

268
00:21:47,642 --> 00:21:49,076
And pretty weird.

269
00:21:49,911 --> 00:21:51,612
Well done.

270
00:21:51,746 --> 00:21:53,147
Yeah, honestly,
I wish I could have forgotten

271
00:21:53,281 --> 00:21:55,550
a whole year when I was a kid.

272
00:21:55,683 --> 00:21:57,685
Could've used
a little meningi-gi.

273
00:22:00,555 --> 00:22:03,191
Uh, you know, there-there is

274
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:05,793
one more weird thing about me.

275
00:22:05,927 --> 00:22:10,198
Um, ever since my coma,
I've...

276
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,200
I've been afraid
of th-the dark.

277
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:16,037
I was afraid of Barbie dolls
till I was, like... now.

278
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:18,840
There's nothing wrong
with being scared.

279
00:22:18,973 --> 00:22:20,241
Just as long as
you don't keep me up

280
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:21,341
with some bright-ass
night-light.

281
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:23,311
Um...

282
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:27,414
Seriously?

283
00:22:27,548 --> 00:22:28,983
Sorry.
Oh, man.

284
00:22:29,116 --> 00:22:30,218
Whatever.

285
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,620
It's fine. I'll deal.

286
00:22:47,602 --> 00:22:49,170
Hey, this is Dalton.

287
00:22:49,303 --> 00:22:50,838
I can't get to the phone
right now,

288
00:22:50,972 --> 00:22:52,773
so leave me a message,
and I'll give you a call back.

289
00:22:52,907 --> 00:22:55,009
Hey, bud. It's me.

290
00:22:55,142 --> 00:22:57,377
Just making sure
you're getting settled in okay.

291
00:22:57,511 --> 00:22:58,512
Um...

292
00:23:00,114 --> 00:23:04,685
I was just, uh, thinking about
what you said,

293
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:06,320
and, um...

294
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:12,093
I don't know. I don't know
what's going on with me,

295
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:13,861
but, um...

296
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,565
...I'm gonna find out.

297
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:21,569
And I just wanted you
to know that.

298
00:23:25,773 --> 00:23:27,375
Okay, bye.

299
00:23:53,935 --> 00:23:57,638
Hello. I am Professor Armagan.

300
00:23:57,772 --> 00:23:59,407
Shut off your phones.

301
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,943
Open your portfolios.

302
00:24:02,076 --> 00:24:04,879
Pull out something
that will interest me.

303
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:09,083
Pin it to your easel.

304
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,451
Stand beside your work.

305
00:24:11,585 --> 00:24:13,421
Stand proud.

306
00:24:22,763 --> 00:24:23,965
Alec Anderson.

307
00:24:24,098 --> 00:24:26,267
Your technique is obvious.

308
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,768
It looks like a photograph.

309
00:24:27,902 --> 00:24:28,769
Thanks.

310
00:24:28,903 --> 00:24:30,771
That wasn't a compliment.

311
00:24:32,907 --> 00:24:34,175
Tear it up.

312
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:35,309
Excuse me?

313
00:24:35,443 --> 00:24:38,145
The drawing.
Tear it up.

314
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:40,681
I worked my ass off
on this piece.

315
00:24:40,815 --> 00:24:41,816
No one will miss it.

316
00:24:44,785 --> 00:24:45,820
No way.

317
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:48,255
Alas.

318
00:24:48,389 --> 00:24:50,124
Our first casualty.

319
00:24:50,257 --> 00:24:52,827
Usually, I go through
introductions

320
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,628
before someone quits.

321
00:24:54,762 --> 00:24:56,998
I didn't quit!
Yes, you did.

322
00:24:57,131 --> 00:24:59,333
You just haven't
realized it yet.

323
00:24:59,467 --> 00:25:00,534
You can go.

324
00:25:11,812 --> 00:25:12,980
Good luck.

325
00:25:15,216 --> 00:25:20,688
Any fool can learn technique,
even master it.

326
00:25:20,821 --> 00:25:24,325
It doesn't mean anything
if it doesn't come from inside.

327
00:25:25,826 --> 00:25:29,930
I am not interested
in the rules of art.

328
00:25:30,064 --> 00:25:32,400
We are going to break
the rules.

329
00:25:33,968 --> 00:25:36,370
Then I want you
to break them again.

330
00:25:36,505 --> 00:25:38,507
See how broken you can get.

331
00:25:47,715 --> 00:25:48,883
Dalton Lambert.

332
00:25:49,016 --> 00:25:50,217
Yes, ma'am.

333
00:25:50,351 --> 00:25:52,653
Why in the hell
would you destroy

334
00:25:52,787 --> 00:25:54,588
a beautiful drawing
like that?

335
00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:03,064
Once more for good measure.

336
00:26:07,134 --> 00:26:09,937
Wasn't so hard,
was it?

337
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:12,706
Good.

338
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,209
You must let go of your past,

339
00:26:15,342 --> 00:26:18,079
shed your skin
in order to grow.

340
00:26:18,212 --> 00:26:20,247
I'll count backwards from ten.

341
00:26:20,381 --> 00:26:24,685
With each number,
I want you to sink further

342
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:27,455
and further into yourself.

343
00:26:28,823 --> 00:26:32,093
Do not lift the charcoal
from the paper.

344
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,663
Ten, nine,

345
00:26:36,464 --> 00:26:40,101
eight, seven,

346
00:26:40,234 --> 00:26:43,604
six, five,

347
00:26:43,737 --> 00:26:47,509
four, three,

348
00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:50,579
two, one.

349
00:26:53,914 --> 00:26:56,283
Draw whatever your soul
brings forth,

350
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:59,153
an experience that defines you.

351
00:27:01,155 --> 00:27:03,691
You've got to be willing
to dredge up

352
00:27:03,824 --> 00:27:06,827
your ugliest,
innermost thoughts.

353
00:28:32,012 --> 00:28:34,215
Is it keeping you in or out?

354
00:28:43,724 --> 00:28:45,492
You'll have
headphones on.

355
00:28:45,627 --> 00:28:50,130
The machine is quite loud,
but you'll be able to hear me.

356
00:28:50,264 --> 00:28:53,602
And I'm gonna need you to stay
as still as possible

357
00:28:53,734 --> 00:28:55,469
throughout the procedure.

358
00:28:55,604 --> 00:28:57,706
You feel like you need
to get out of there,

359
00:28:57,838 --> 00:29:01,008
give the call ball a squeeze,
we'll give you a break.

360
00:29:01,141 --> 00:29:02,711
You good?

361
00:29:02,843 --> 00:29:04,111
Overjoyed.

362
00:29:04,245 --> 00:29:05,746
All aboard.

363
00:29:19,326 --> 00:29:21,428
Don't forget this.

364
00:29:36,343 --> 00:29:39,079
Okay. You comfortable, Josh?

365
00:29:39,213 --> 00:29:41,815
Yep.
Let's just get this over with.

366
00:30:19,386 --> 00:30:20,588
Hello?

367
00:30:23,357 --> 00:30:25,125
Dr. Brower?

368
00:30:29,296 --> 00:30:30,732
Dr. Brower?

369
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,269
There's someone with you.

370
00:30:35,402 --> 00:30:36,638
Wh-What?

371
00:30:36,771 --> 00:30:38,205
What did you say?

372
00:30:39,674 --> 00:30:41,576
Dr. Brower, what did you say?

373
00:30:48,415 --> 00:30:49,483
Wh...

374
00:30:52,986 --> 00:30:54,188
Come on.

375
00:30:55,724 --> 00:30:57,224
Um...

376
00:30:57,358 --> 00:30:58,859
Okay, can you
let me out, please?

377
00:31:01,328 --> 00:31:02,963
Hello! Hey!

378
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:05,866
Can you let me out?!

379
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:09,136
The door is open.

380
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:10,839
Okay, okay. Let me out.

381
00:31:10,971 --> 00:31:13,240
Let me out! Hey! Dr. Brower!

382
00:31:13,374 --> 00:31:14,441
Dr. Brower, let me out!

383
00:31:14,576 --> 00:31:16,276
Come on. Get me out of here!

384
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,812
Hello?!

385
00:31:17,945 --> 00:31:18,879
Hey!

386
00:31:24,051 --> 00:31:25,520
Just let me out.

387
00:31:25,653 --> 00:31:27,555
Let me out, let me out,
let me out.

388
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:29,858
Dr. Brower?

389
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:30,958
Come on.

390
00:31:33,561 --> 00:31:34,696
Let me out.

391
00:32:00,187 --> 00:32:01,455
Okay. Come on.

392
00:32:02,757 --> 00:32:04,626
Okay.

393
00:32:05,727 --> 00:32:07,027
Mr. Lambert?

394
00:32:07,161 --> 00:32:08,596
What was that? What was that?!
Are you okay?

395
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,130
What was that?!
Why did the lights go out?!

396
00:32:10,264 --> 00:32:11,131
Calm down.

397
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:13,133
Y-You said the lights went out?

398
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:15,837
All the lights went out,
and I got stuck in there, man.

399
00:32:15,969 --> 00:32:17,438
And I saw...

400
00:32:22,075 --> 00:32:25,312
Mr. Lambert, you've been asleep
for 15 minutes.

401
00:32:25,446 --> 00:32:27,080
You went right out.

402
00:32:27,214 --> 00:32:29,483
Uh, your MRI
went perfectly.

403
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:36,490
What?
Take your time and get dressed.

404
00:32:36,624 --> 00:32:38,660
Come on through.

405
00:32:49,671 --> 00:32:51,573
There's nothing
physically wrong with you.

406
00:32:51,706 --> 00:32:54,776
No growths or spots
on the brain.

407
00:32:54,909 --> 00:32:56,811
Nothing to be concerned about.

408
00:33:00,748 --> 00:33:04,519
That's good news,
Mr. Lambert.

409
00:33:04,652 --> 00:33:05,954
Yeah, no, I know.

410
00:33:06,086 --> 00:33:07,287
I, uh...

411
00:33:09,256 --> 00:33:11,458
I guess I was just hoping
for something real.

412
00:33:12,794 --> 00:33:16,029
Something that could
explain this... fog.

413
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:17,966
The memory issues
you're talking about,

414
00:33:18,098 --> 00:33:19,901
they could be spurred on
by a number of things.

415
00:33:20,033 --> 00:33:23,605
Increased stress,
change in daily habits.

416
00:33:23,738 --> 00:33:26,373
Have there been any disruptions
in your home life?

417
00:33:28,743 --> 00:33:31,513
My, uh, mom
passed away recently.

418
00:33:31,646 --> 00:33:34,081
I'm sorry for your loss.

419
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,384
Not to mention
my son left for school,

420
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:42,524
and, uh, my ex-wife
hardly talks to me, so...

421
00:33:42,657 --> 00:33:44,559
That certainly
sounds stressful.
Yeah.

422
00:33:44,692 --> 00:33:47,361
Maybe a grief counselor
could be of some help.

423
00:33:49,463 --> 00:33:51,231
Yeah. Sure. Probably would.

424
00:33:53,635 --> 00:33:57,539
Do you have any history of
mental illness in your family?

425
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,674
Mental illness?

426
00:33:59,807 --> 00:34:01,308
It's nothing to be
alarmed about.

427
00:34:01,441 --> 00:34:03,711
It can be informative
as we try to make a diagnosis.

428
00:34:03,845 --> 00:34:06,280
Not that I'm aware of.
It's worth looking into.

429
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:09,049
Meanwhile,
there are exercises,

430
00:34:09,182 --> 00:34:11,084
games you can do
to stimulate your memory.

431
00:34:11,218 --> 00:34:14,254
Matching games,
like-like-like kids do.

432
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:16,691
You want me to play
kids' games?

433
00:34:16,824 --> 00:34:18,560
We could learn a lot from kids.

434
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:22,864
Yeah.

435
00:34:26,901 --> 00:34:28,036
Thanks.

436
00:37:53,741 --> 00:37:54,876
Whatcha doin'?

437
00:38:00,715 --> 00:38:01,983
Got my new
room assignment today,

438
00:38:02,116 --> 00:38:04,519
so, alas,
no more panty parties.

439
00:38:04,652 --> 00:38:08,256
But consolation: I'm in 323
now, right above you.

440
00:38:08,421 --> 00:38:09,824
So be cautious, young man,

441
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:12,593
lest I hear you slap your
sausage in the dead of night.

442
00:38:19,267 --> 00:38:20,568
You want to join a frat?

443
00:38:20,701 --> 00:38:23,004
What? Oh.

444
00:38:23,137 --> 00:38:24,739
No, it's just something
my dad got me.

445
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,374
We should go.

446
00:38:27,508 --> 00:38:30,711
We can make fun of their
khaki pants and trust funds.

447
00:38:30,845 --> 00:38:32,513
Unless you're not done
redecorating.

448
00:38:33,948 --> 00:38:34,982
Come on, Dolphin.

449
00:38:35,116 --> 00:38:36,684
Do something nice
for your old man.

450
00:38:36,818 --> 00:38:38,853
What's the worst
that could happen?

451
00:38:44,058 --> 00:38:45,860
May I offer you
some diaper pudding?

452
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:48,495
Uh, I'm good.

453
00:38:48,629 --> 00:38:49,931
Uh, no.

454
00:38:50,064 --> 00:38:51,599
Whatever.

455
00:38:51,732 --> 00:38:53,935
Seriously?
Oh, come on.

456
00:38:54,068 --> 00:38:55,870
Quit your bitchin'
and come here.

457
00:38:56,003 --> 00:38:57,305
To memorialize the night

458
00:38:57,437 --> 00:38:59,907
that Dalton Lambert
actually has fun.

459
00:39:03,978 --> 00:39:07,882
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

460
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:10,151
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

461
00:39:10,284 --> 00:39:12,653
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

462
00:39:21,162 --> 00:39:23,197
What's "frat juice"?

463
00:39:23,331 --> 00:39:24,732
- Don't ask.
- Hey, hey, hey!

464
00:39:24,866 --> 00:39:26,701
Everyone, my name's Nick.

465
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:29,770
Nick the Dick! Nick the Dick!

466
00:39:29,904 --> 00:39:32,506
Nick the Dick! Nick the Dick!

467
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,075
Welcome to the Kappa house,

468
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:35,576
and welcome back to school,
baby.

469
00:39:36,978 --> 00:39:41,182
I'm just here to remind you,
fine folks,

470
00:39:41,315 --> 00:39:43,251
that frats,
they're under attack.

471
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:44,886
Right?

472
00:39:45,019 --> 00:39:47,688
And we must protect
our right to party

473
00:39:47,822 --> 00:39:49,422
and to be awesome.

474
00:39:49,557 --> 00:39:53,227
White, Black, brown or blue,
you're all welcome at JPU,

475
00:39:53,361 --> 00:39:58,232
provided that you recognize
and respect

476
00:39:58,366 --> 00:40:01,636
that the frat house
is the last house

477
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:03,971
where men can still be men!

478
00:40:10,044 --> 00:40:11,245
Thank-thank you.

479
00:40:11,379 --> 00:40:14,215
Now, we got a lot of drinking
to do tonight,

480
00:40:14,348 --> 00:40:17,218
but pace yourselves.

481
00:40:17,351 --> 00:40:19,253
We do not need
another incident.

482
00:40:19,387 --> 00:40:20,420
Yeah, rest in peace.

483
00:40:20,554 --> 00:40:22,590
Party's lame.
Confirmed.

484
00:40:22,723 --> 00:40:24,424
So let's go upstairs and
look through everyone's shit.

485
00:40:38,272 --> 00:40:39,774
Yeah.

486
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:50,918
We should make this quick.

487
00:40:53,754 --> 00:40:56,824
Permission to proceed granted.

488
00:40:58,059 --> 00:40:59,327
Wait.

489
00:41:11,572 --> 00:41:12,974
Huh. Oh.

490
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:19,914
Oh, no.

491
00:41:20,047 --> 00:41:21,649
This is Nick's room.

492
00:41:21,782 --> 00:41:23,517
And this is
Nick's butthole cream.

493
00:41:23,651 --> 00:41:26,854
I'm gonna go spread this
on the communal crapper. BRB.

494
00:41:26,988 --> 00:41:28,189
Wait.

495
00:41:57,985 --> 00:41:59,487
Hey, man.

496
00:42:07,895 --> 00:42:09,663
Hey, man, you-you okay?

497
00:42:09,797 --> 00:42:12,266
You need water or something?

498
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,035
Make it stop.

499
00:42:15,169 --> 00:42:16,505
Make it stop.

500
00:42:17,671 --> 00:42:18,572
Make it stop.

501
00:42:20,141 --> 00:42:21,742
Close the door.

502
00:42:22,843 --> 00:42:24,345
Close the...

503
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,915
Close the door!

504
00:42:28,049 --> 00:42:29,817
No, no, no, no. No, don't leave.

505
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:31,485
- Come on, I just...
- I-I'll be right back.

506
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:33,754
I just need some, uh, supplies.

507
00:42:39,493 --> 00:42:43,130
Hey, Paige. I am Nick.

508
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,302
♪ Tonight is your night, bro ♪

509
00:42:48,436 --> 00:42:50,805
♪ Tonight is the night. ♪

510
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,742
Gotcha.

511
00:43:01,415 --> 00:43:03,918
Come on, man.

512
00:43:05,853 --> 00:43:07,588
Just be you, bro.

513
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:11,325
You want to dance?

514
00:43:12,927 --> 00:43:14,261
Let's dance.

515
00:43:17,298 --> 00:43:19,233
Let's dance.

516
00:43:32,547 --> 00:43:33,881
Oh.

517
00:43:35,584 --> 00:43:37,952
♪ Tonight's the night, bro. ♪

518
00:44:49,323 --> 00:44:51,492
Be quiet.

519
00:44:52,726 --> 00:44:54,695
Are you good?

520
00:44:56,697 --> 00:44:58,365
I think I just saw...

521
00:44:58,499 --> 00:44:59,400
What?

522
00:45:02,102 --> 00:45:05,072
We need to go. Now.
But this is just getting fun.

523
00:45:05,206 --> 00:45:06,340
Yo, is somebody in my room?

524
00:45:06,473 --> 00:45:07,676
Shit, shit.
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

525
00:45:07,808 --> 00:45:09,410
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
Come here.

526
00:45:09,544 --> 00:45:11,412
One of you peckerwoods
is about to get the hammer drop.

527
00:45:11,546 --> 00:45:12,846
Mmm, mmm.

528
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:13,847
What the hell?

529
00:45:15,684 --> 00:45:18,352
Oh, my God. So sorry.

530
00:45:18,485 --> 00:45:22,823
We were just looking
for some privacy, you know?

531
00:45:22,957 --> 00:45:25,092
We were gonna do it.

532
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:27,895
I'd rather watch
my parents do it.

533
00:45:29,063 --> 00:45:31,332
But you should stick around.

534
00:45:31,465 --> 00:45:33,602
We might get drunk enough
to find you attractive.

535
00:45:35,236 --> 00:45:37,338
Even though
you look like a clown.

536
00:45:38,339 --> 00:45:40,274
Nick the Dick, huh?

537
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:43,744
I'm more partial
to kick the dick.

538
00:45:43,877 --> 00:45:45,647
Run.

539
00:45:51,686 --> 00:45:53,555
That was pretty quick thinking
back there, right?

540
00:45:53,688 --> 00:45:55,389
I, uh...

541
00:45:55,523 --> 00:45:56,890
Oh, crap.

542
00:45:57,024 --> 00:45:59,026
Ugh, I should've asked
before I kissed you, right?

543
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:01,563
I am sorry. I was just--
I was going on instinct.

544
00:46:01,696 --> 00:46:02,863
Oh, no.
Are you okay?

545
00:46:02,997 --> 00:46:05,299
I'm fine.
It's just, I, um...

546
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:14,775
I'm just sorry
for what he said to you.

547
00:46:14,908 --> 00:46:16,810
Oh.

548
00:46:16,944 --> 00:46:18,747
Whatever.

549
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,914
You think I care
what Vineyard Vines thinks?

550
00:46:21,048 --> 00:46:22,182
He should be so lucky.

551
00:46:23,718 --> 00:46:26,153
Hey, buddy, it is, uh, me again.

552
00:46:26,287 --> 00:46:28,623
Um, I went to the doctor.

553
00:46:28,757 --> 00:46:31,959
Um, and-and everything's okay.

554
00:46:32,092 --> 00:46:33,762
Well, not okay, but, uh,

555
00:46:33,894 --> 00:46:35,730
I'm getting
to the bottom of it, so...

556
00:46:35,863 --> 00:46:38,265
Uh, just give me a call
when you can. All right.

557
00:46:38,399 --> 00:46:40,334
I lo... I-I, uh...

558
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:41,770
I'm really sorry, Dalton,

559
00:46:41,902 --> 00:46:43,738
about what I said
the other day.

560
00:46:44,905 --> 00:46:46,675
All right, bye.

561
00:49:55,295 --> 00:49:57,832
Where is my mayonnaise?

562
00:50:01,134 --> 00:50:02,469
Who is it?

563
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,436
Please don't tell me
you're really just a creep.

564
00:51:09,571 --> 00:51:11,171
What? No.

565
00:51:11,305 --> 00:51:12,774
Then what the hell
is going on?

566
00:51:15,009 --> 00:51:16,109
Come on in.

567
00:51:26,721 --> 00:51:28,056
Something's happening to me.

568
00:51:28,188 --> 00:51:30,424
I'm seeing things,
crazy things.

569
00:51:30,558 --> 00:51:32,594
You know that kid
at the frat house

570
00:51:32,727 --> 00:51:34,729
that they talked about
with the incident?

571
00:51:34,862 --> 00:51:37,264
Uh-huh.
I saw him, and he was dead.

572
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:40,969
It started with
an art exercise,

573
00:51:41,101 --> 00:51:44,471
and she asked us to dig deep
into a memory,

574
00:51:44,606 --> 00:51:46,541
into our-our subconscious.

575
00:51:46,674 --> 00:51:49,476
So I did,
and I drew this door.

576
00:51:49,611 --> 00:51:51,244
You really need
to lay off the frat juice.

577
00:51:51,378 --> 00:51:52,580
I'm serious.

578
00:51:54,048 --> 00:51:57,117
Tonight, I was painting,
and I fell asleep.

579
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:59,186
And when I woke up,
this lantern appeared.

580
00:51:59,319 --> 00:52:02,322
It... it was like a dream,
but it wasn't a dream.

581
00:52:02,456 --> 00:52:05,425
And then I-I walked
to your room.

582
00:52:06,828 --> 00:52:09,097
I-I know
how this sounds.

583
00:52:23,978 --> 00:52:27,749
I feel like I'm getting
closer to something.

584
00:52:27,882 --> 00:52:29,784
Or something's
getting closer to me.

585
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:37,058
You got an extra pillow?

586
00:54:28,569 --> 00:54:30,270
Okay.

587
00:54:31,606 --> 00:54:32,740
Foster.

588
00:54:33,808 --> 00:54:35,243
Renai.

589
00:54:37,444 --> 00:54:38,946
Dalton.

590
00:54:41,048 --> 00:54:42,349
Kali.

591
00:54:45,052 --> 00:54:46,120
Dalton.

592
00:54:48,556 --> 00:54:49,891
Dalton?

593
00:54:51,058 --> 00:54:52,392
Dalton!

594
00:54:58,266 --> 00:54:59,567
Mom.

595
00:55:28,095 --> 00:55:29,496
Okay.

596
00:55:31,299 --> 00:55:33,433
Okay, Mom, help me out.

597
00:55:37,337 --> 00:55:39,339
Kali.

598
00:55:39,472 --> 00:55:41,309
Dalton. Dalton.

599
00:55:42,677 --> 00:55:43,978
Mom.

600
00:55:46,547 --> 00:55:47,715
Mom?

601
00:55:48,883 --> 00:55:50,051
Mom.

602
00:55:51,418 --> 00:55:53,554
I don't know. I don't know.

603
00:56:28,222 --> 00:56:29,223
Okay.

604
00:56:56,984 --> 00:56:58,052
Right.

605
00:57:59,947 --> 00:58:01,481
Chiaroscuro.

606
00:58:03,718 --> 00:58:05,953
The dance of light and shadow.

607
00:58:07,621 --> 00:58:11,892
An effect used not only
to create volume and definition

608
00:58:12,026 --> 00:58:16,864
but also a specific,
unseen light source.

609
00:58:16,998 --> 00:58:17,999
Right.

610
00:58:18,132 --> 00:58:21,335
This is one of Goya's best.

611
00:58:21,469 --> 00:58:25,406
The negative space
draws our eyes towards Saturn.

612
00:58:25,539 --> 00:58:30,811
Does it represent darkness
or some void?

613
00:58:30,945 --> 00:58:33,848
Goya mastered it on the canvas,
but family problems

614
00:58:33,981 --> 00:58:35,850
- and health issues...
- Please, Daddy.

615
00:58:35,983 --> 00:58:39,120
...sent this once revered
court painter

616
00:58:39,253 --> 00:58:42,556
into a dark spiral,
leading him to create

617
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:46,394
this grisly portrait
of a father devouring his son.

618
00:58:51,232 --> 00:58:54,068
This balance between
light and dark

619
00:58:54,201 --> 00:58:55,569
is what we're after.

620
00:58:55,703 --> 00:58:57,438
Get ready.

621
00:59:01,175 --> 00:59:04,078
Your own experiences
shape your artwork.

622
00:59:04,211 --> 00:59:05,980
Embrace them.

623
00:59:06,113 --> 00:59:07,248
Use them.

624
00:59:07,381 --> 00:59:12,086
Sink deep into
the darkness of memory.

625
00:59:12,219 --> 00:59:16,023
Ten, nine,

626
00:59:16,157 --> 00:59:19,593
eight, seven,

627
00:59:19,727 --> 00:59:22,630
six, five,

628
00:59:22,763 --> 00:59:25,566
four, three,

629
00:59:25,699 --> 00:59:28,402
two, one...

630
01:00:22,623 --> 01:00:23,491
'Sup, nerd?

631
01:00:23,624 --> 01:00:25,659
A red door.
A purple pecker.

632
01:00:25,793 --> 01:00:27,361
Come on, man. Doesn't that
mean anything to you?

633
01:00:27,495 --> 01:00:28,462
A red door?

634
01:00:28,597 --> 01:00:30,764
You sound weirder than usual.

635
01:00:30,898 --> 01:00:33,400
It's a thing from art class.
It's a painting.

636
01:00:33,535 --> 01:00:36,103
We had to find a memory.

637
01:00:36,237 --> 01:00:37,972
I thought it was something
from our childhood.

638
01:00:38,105 --> 01:00:39,073
Did you ask Mom?

639
01:00:39,206 --> 01:00:41,442
No, I don't want to worry her.

640
01:00:41,576 --> 01:00:42,810
Why would that worry her?

641
01:00:45,212 --> 01:00:46,413
I don't know.

642
01:00:46,548 --> 01:00:48,349
Is this what happens
when you go to college?

643
01:00:48,482 --> 01:00:49,783
You get all cryptic and shit?

644
01:00:51,152 --> 01:00:53,320
I guess.
Well, I'm not going, then.

645
01:01:19,813 --> 01:01:21,882
So, after the whole spooky

646
01:01:22,016 --> 01:01:23,984
dream-not-a-dream thing
the other night,

647
01:01:24,118 --> 01:01:27,087
I started thinking,
"Yeah, okay, Dalton's a weirdo,

648
01:01:27,221 --> 01:01:29,190
but he's not insane, right?"

649
01:01:29,323 --> 01:01:31,158
I'm gonna need that key back.
Right.

650
01:01:31,292 --> 01:01:35,530
So, I started poking around
the old interwebs,

651
01:01:35,664 --> 01:01:37,164
and guess what.

652
01:01:37,298 --> 01:01:38,966
You're not crazy at all.

653
01:01:39,099 --> 01:01:42,036
You are an astral projector.

654
01:01:42,169 --> 01:01:44,004
Check this out.

655
01:01:44,138 --> 01:01:46,740
Looks like they filmed it
in between shifts at Best Buy.

656
01:01:46,874 --> 01:01:48,742
Hey, guys,
this is "Spectral Sightings."

657
01:01:48,876 --> 01:01:50,110
I'm Specs.
This is Tucker.

658
01:01:50,244 --> 01:01:51,779
Say hi, Tucker.
No.

659
01:01:51,912 --> 01:01:55,783
Okay. We are PPI, Professional
Paranormal Investigators.

660
01:01:55,916 --> 01:01:57,619
Today, we're gonna be
talking about something

661
01:01:57,751 --> 01:02:00,622
that dozens of you
have been asking us about.

662
01:02:00,754 --> 01:02:02,456
Astral projection.

663
01:02:02,591 --> 01:02:03,757
It's a real phenomenon.

664
01:02:03,891 --> 01:02:05,694
Our physical body falls asleep,

665
01:02:05,826 --> 01:02:08,530
and our astral body

666
01:02:08,663 --> 01:02:12,333
leaves that physical body and
floats off into another realm.

667
01:02:12,466 --> 01:02:14,268
That's exactly
what it feels like.

668
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:15,869
See, I told you.
It's cool, right?

669
01:02:16,003 --> 01:02:18,506
Our former mentor,
Dr. Elise Rainier,

670
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,709
she had a name
for this other realm.

671
01:02:20,841 --> 01:02:22,611
She called it The Further.

672
01:02:22,743 --> 01:02:23,811
Hold on.

673
01:02:28,415 --> 01:02:31,118
I am Elise.

674
01:02:31,252 --> 01:02:32,721
It's nice to see you all.

675
01:02:32,853 --> 01:02:38,560
So, I'm here to talk to you
about astral projection

676
01:02:38,693 --> 01:02:40,761
and The Further.

677
01:02:40,894 --> 01:02:43,297
Okay.

678
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:45,232
Give me a minute here.

679
01:02:45,366 --> 01:02:47,801
Three,

680
01:02:47,935 --> 01:02:49,903
two,

681
01:02:50,037 --> 01:02:51,105
one.

682
01:02:53,708 --> 01:02:58,513
The Further is a dark realm

683
01:02:58,647 --> 01:03:02,016
filled with tortured souls
of the dead,

684
01:03:02,149 --> 01:03:07,555
and some are doomed

685
01:03:07,689 --> 01:03:09,957
to live the worst mistakes
of their lives

686
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:12,960
over and over and over
for all eternity.

687
01:03:14,128 --> 01:03:15,829
When you astral project

688
01:03:15,963 --> 01:03:18,899
or you travel to this realm,

689
01:03:19,033 --> 01:03:23,672
these are the souls that
you awaken with your presence.

690
01:03:23,804 --> 01:03:25,205
They can smell you.

691
01:03:26,173 --> 01:03:29,611
The presence of life.

692
01:03:29,744 --> 01:03:33,615
Life is what they crave
more than anything,

693
01:03:33,748 --> 01:03:37,117
so the further you travel,

694
01:03:38,553 --> 01:03:41,255
the riskier
the journey becomes.

695
01:03:41,388 --> 01:03:45,593
They want life, and they can
come to our world to get it.

696
01:03:46,827 --> 01:03:49,330
Keep a steady stride.

697
01:03:54,769 --> 01:03:59,173
Oh, I see those gears turning.
What is it?

698
01:03:59,306 --> 01:04:01,041
That kid from the frat house?

699
01:04:01,175 --> 01:04:02,309
The pukey kid?

700
01:04:02,443 --> 01:04:05,212
Yeah.
He said something to me.

701
01:04:05,346 --> 01:04:07,515
He said, "Close the door."

702
01:04:07,649 --> 01:04:09,784
I'm sure he did. It probably
wasn't his proudest moment.

703
01:04:09,917 --> 01:04:14,054
Yeah, but what if
he meant something else?

704
01:04:14,188 --> 01:04:16,691
What if he was
talking about this door?

705
01:04:16,825 --> 01:04:18,793
So, what,
you want to go back and ask him?

706
01:04:21,862 --> 01:04:22,831
Seriously?

707
01:04:22,963 --> 01:04:24,164
I need to know.

708
01:04:24,298 --> 01:04:28,068
I-I feel bad for the dude,
I do, but...

709
01:04:28,202 --> 01:04:30,739
dark realms are typically
places I try to avoid.

710
01:04:30,871 --> 01:04:33,708
There's something...

711
01:04:33,842 --> 01:04:37,211
important about
this painting, Chris.

712
01:04:38,513 --> 01:04:39,947
I have to find out.

713
01:04:41,115 --> 01:04:42,517
Okay.

714
01:04:44,652 --> 01:04:46,920
But it's not like Nick the Dick
is just gonna let you

715
01:04:47,054 --> 01:04:49,490
waltz into his bedroom and chat
with the ghost in his toilet.

716
01:04:50,625 --> 01:04:52,259
He'll never know I'm there.

717
01:05:04,839 --> 01:05:06,306
So, what's the plan?

718
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,543
- I got this.
- Can I help you?

719
01:05:11,713 --> 01:05:13,113
Hello.

720
01:05:13,247 --> 01:05:16,450
I have left my brassiere
in Nicholas's room,

721
01:05:16,584 --> 01:05:18,952
and I was wondering
if he is perchance home?

722
01:05:19,086 --> 01:05:22,757
I think he's upstairs
studying with Paige.

723
01:05:22,891 --> 01:05:25,259
Great job, Dolphin.

724
01:05:27,394 --> 01:05:29,296
So, I'm gonna read you this.

725
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:30,998
It's called "In Flames."

726
01:05:31,131 --> 01:05:32,966
Very vulnerable piece.

727
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,836
"Looking across a campfire,

728
01:05:34,968 --> 01:05:37,505
"they say it's beautiful.

729
01:05:37,639 --> 01:05:39,339
But without you
on the other side..."

730
01:05:39,473 --> 01:05:41,408
I need a room with darkness.

731
01:05:41,543 --> 01:05:42,777
Okay.

732
01:05:46,213 --> 01:05:47,649
Then what?

733
01:05:47,782 --> 01:05:51,619
You gonna float through the air
and do a little, "Ooh"?

734
01:05:52,887 --> 01:05:54,254
I'm not, like, a ghost.

735
01:05:54,388 --> 01:05:56,957
And you never will be
with that attitude, Casper.

736
01:05:59,059 --> 01:06:00,662
Bingo.

737
01:06:04,732 --> 01:06:07,167
What are the chances
those bedsheets are crusty?

738
01:06:07,301 --> 01:06:09,169
Probably snap
like a taco shell.

739
01:06:09,303 --> 01:06:11,271
I'll take the dirty floor.

740
01:06:16,076 --> 01:06:17,110
Okay.

741
01:06:25,452 --> 01:06:27,087
Can you, like,
give me a little space?

742
01:06:27,221 --> 01:06:28,656
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

743
01:06:37,866 --> 01:06:38,967
Okay, you ready?

744
01:06:42,035 --> 01:06:45,172
Ten, nine,

745
01:06:45,305 --> 01:06:48,877
eight, seven,

746
01:06:49,009 --> 01:06:52,145
six, five,

747
01:06:52,279 --> 01:06:55,382
four, three,

748
01:06:55,517 --> 01:06:59,453
two, one.

749
01:07:13,367 --> 01:07:14,869
Are you floating yet?

750
01:07:27,214 --> 01:07:29,049
Farewell, traveler.

751
01:07:40,193 --> 01:07:41,896
You out here, Dalton?

752
01:08:04,686 --> 01:08:07,555
Probably be a creative
writing double major.

753
01:08:09,023 --> 01:08:10,792
But I'm also crazy good
at finance,

754
01:08:10,925 --> 01:08:13,393
so I don't want
to waste that gift.

755
01:08:13,528 --> 01:08:15,563
How long do you
have to keep that on?

756
01:08:16,698 --> 01:08:18,533
Oh.

757
01:08:18,666 --> 01:08:19,767
Yeah, it's good now.

758
01:08:21,435 --> 01:08:22,770
My pores are good.

759
01:09:00,074 --> 01:09:02,142
Uh, I'm-I'm-a be a while.

760
01:09:02,275 --> 01:09:03,645
Gross.

761
01:09:18,092 --> 01:09:18,993
Dalton?

762
01:09:21,461 --> 01:09:23,296
Dalton?

763
01:09:25,833 --> 01:09:27,434
S-Someone, turn on the lights!

764
01:09:34,642 --> 01:09:37,045
Dalton? Dalton?

765
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:41,883
Dalton, wake up.
Chris.

766
01:09:42,016 --> 01:09:44,585
- Guys! Seriously.
- Guys, who's messing with me?

767
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:46,054
Close the door!

768
01:09:46,186 --> 01:09:48,589
Close the door!

769
01:09:49,557 --> 01:09:50,490
Dalton?

770
01:10:00,868 --> 01:10:02,202
Close the door!
Chris!

771
01:10:20,021 --> 01:10:21,488
Oh, God.

772
01:10:28,796 --> 01:10:30,397
Come on!

773
01:10:37,538 --> 01:10:38,973
Chris.

774
01:10:40,174 --> 01:10:41,109
What?

775
01:11:05,633 --> 01:11:07,467
Come on.

776
01:11:31,259 --> 01:11:32,960
What?

777
01:11:58,586 --> 01:12:01,155
Chris. Chris. Hey,

778
01:12:01,289 --> 01:12:03,124
I didn't mean, like, that...
Don't.

779
01:12:04,826 --> 01:12:06,961
I-I just wanted to see
if you're okay.

780
01:12:07,094 --> 01:12:08,996
I'm okay.

781
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:10,531
I'm sorry.

782
01:12:10,665 --> 01:12:12,967
I didn't know anyone could
get hurt in the real world.

783
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:15,503
Well, they can.

784
01:12:16,971 --> 01:12:20,007
You have no idea
what you're messing with.

785
01:12:20,141 --> 01:12:22,342
I can't be
a part of this, Dalton.

786
01:12:22,475 --> 01:12:23,678
And neither should you,

787
01:12:23,811 --> 01:12:25,980
because next time,
you might not wake up.

788
01:12:50,504 --> 01:12:51,505
Hey.

789
01:12:51,639 --> 01:12:53,507
Hi.
Uh, it's not your weekend.

790
01:12:53,641 --> 01:12:55,375
Kali's at a sleepover,
and Foster's...

791
01:12:55,509 --> 01:12:58,112
I'm not here for the kids.

792
01:12:58,246 --> 01:12:59,347
Can we talk?

793
01:13:00,815 --> 01:13:01,949
Sure.

794
01:13:09,924 --> 01:13:11,792
Wow, two calls in one week.

795
01:13:11,926 --> 01:13:13,060
Come on, man.

796
01:13:13,194 --> 01:13:14,262
Haven't you made
any friends yet?

797
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:18,733
Tell me everything you remember
about my coma.

798
01:13:21,202 --> 01:13:22,670
You should talk to Mom.

799
01:13:22,803 --> 01:13:26,507
I-I think these-these things
I-I'm drawing, they-they...

800
01:13:26,641 --> 01:13:29,877
The door?
And now a guy with a hammer.

801
01:13:31,345 --> 01:13:32,613
A hammer?

802
01:13:32,747 --> 01:13:36,183
I-I think they could be
clues from my past,

803
01:13:36,317 --> 01:13:38,451
thoughts that have disappeared
'cause of my coma.

804
01:13:38,586 --> 01:13:39,854
I don't know why
that they're coming out now,

805
01:13:39,987 --> 01:13:42,223
but they are, and I...
Wait. Dalton.

806
01:13:44,424 --> 01:13:45,993
What is it?

807
01:13:46,127 --> 01:13:48,495
I've had this image
in my mind for years.

808
01:13:48,629 --> 01:13:53,601
Mom always says it's not real,
it's just a bad dream, but...

809
01:13:53,734 --> 01:13:55,169
Tell me, little brother.

810
01:13:55,303 --> 01:13:56,304
Come on.

811
01:13:59,774 --> 01:14:02,610
Okay.
We're in a room somewhere.

812
01:14:02,743 --> 01:14:04,111
Like a basement.

813
01:14:05,246 --> 01:14:06,280
Do you remember that?

814
01:14:10,918 --> 01:14:11,919
Dalton, you there?

815
01:15:22,289 --> 01:15:25,526
All I ever wanted was to be
better than my father.

816
01:15:25,659 --> 01:15:28,696
You know that.
Just to be a... a good dad.

817
01:15:28,829 --> 01:15:30,798
You were. You are, Josh.

818
01:15:30,931 --> 01:15:33,667
Well, Dalton would disagree.

819
01:15:33,801 --> 01:15:35,336
Well, uh,
if it's any consolation,

820
01:15:35,469 --> 01:15:37,004
I can't even get him
to call me back.

821
01:15:40,775 --> 01:15:44,378
My dad abandoned his family,
and I've done the same thing.

822
01:15:44,513 --> 01:15:46,547
No, you haven't.

823
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:48,049
You're not him, Josh,

824
01:15:48,182 --> 01:15:49,583
and you're allowed
to be angry at him.

825
01:15:49,717 --> 01:15:51,018
I am angry.

826
01:15:51,152 --> 01:15:52,253
I've been angry
for a long time,

827
01:15:52,386 --> 01:15:54,121
angry at a man
that I have never met.

828
01:15:55,423 --> 01:15:57,291
Angry at a man
that jumped off the roof

829
01:15:57,425 --> 01:16:00,461
of a mental hospital
in 1978.

830
01:16:02,496 --> 01:16:06,367
For more than 40 years,
that man has been dead and gone.

831
01:16:06,501 --> 01:16:09,136
My dad. Ben Burton.

832
01:16:12,173 --> 01:16:15,209
So how in the hell is
he terrorizing me here, now,

833
01:16:15,342 --> 01:16:16,477
in the real world?

834
01:16:16,610 --> 01:16:18,212
He attacked me
at Mom's place...

835
01:16:18,345 --> 01:16:20,081
He attacked you?
Yeah.

836
01:16:20,214 --> 01:16:22,450
So-so am I just crazy or...

837
01:16:23,584 --> 01:16:25,419
I don't know.

838
01:16:25,554 --> 01:16:27,788
He, uh...

839
01:16:29,657 --> 01:16:33,562
...left this for my mom
the day he died.

840
01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:37,965
What ends with him?

841
01:16:39,834 --> 01:16:40,968
Josh...

842
01:16:41,102 --> 01:16:43,737
Is-is that the answer?
Am I just crazy?

843
01:16:43,871 --> 01:16:45,473
Is his madness inside of me?

844
01:16:45,606 --> 01:16:49,276
And is that why I've been
so lost the past few years?

845
01:16:49,410 --> 01:16:50,978
I mean, did I pass this curse
on to our kids?

846
01:16:51,112 --> 01:16:52,581
I mean, is he gonna haunt them
like he haunted me?

847
01:16:52,713 --> 01:16:54,482
Josh. Josh. Josh.
I mean, why didn't my mother

848
01:16:54,615 --> 01:16:56,917
say anything about this?
Stop. Stop. Stop.

849
01:16:57,051 --> 01:16:58,953
You're not crazy.

850
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:02,189
You're not crazy.

851
01:17:02,323 --> 01:17:04,692
Then what's happening to me?

852
01:17:53,674 --> 01:17:54,842
Dalton.

853
01:17:59,648 --> 01:18:04,418
So Dalton and I could travel
to some other...

854
01:18:05,986 --> 01:18:07,154
...dimension,

855
01:18:08,222 --> 01:18:10,257
where we were haunted

856
01:18:10,391 --> 01:18:13,027
by ghosts and goblins.

857
01:18:15,329 --> 01:18:17,731
More like entities,

858
01:18:17,865 --> 01:18:20,734
like the one in those photos
that haunted you.

859
01:18:22,036 --> 01:18:24,238
And your father,
he saw them, too,

860
01:18:24,371 --> 01:18:26,840
and maybe
he's just reaching out.

861
01:18:30,477 --> 01:18:32,980
Back then, he told your mom.
She didn't understand.

862
01:18:33,113 --> 01:18:34,381
She-she didn't know
how to help him.

863
01:18:34,516 --> 01:18:37,251
Oh, help him
like you helped us?

864
01:18:37,384 --> 01:18:39,554
By suppressing our memories?

865
01:18:39,688 --> 01:18:43,057
We all thought it was for
the best, Josh, you included.

866
01:18:43,190 --> 01:18:46,695
But you got foggy.

867
01:18:50,632 --> 01:18:52,900
The suppression,
it-it slowed you down.

868
01:18:53,033 --> 01:18:55,736
And your mom and I,
we didn't know what to do,

869
01:18:55,869 --> 01:18:58,239
and I was too scared
to tell you the truth.

870
01:19:00,074 --> 01:19:02,810
Dalton was right.

871
01:19:02,943 --> 01:19:05,079
He said my mom had secrets,

872
01:19:05,212 --> 01:19:08,916
that she was hiding something
from us.

873
01:19:09,049 --> 01:19:11,653
I just never thought
you did, too.

874
01:19:13,622 --> 01:19:14,755
For ten years...
You have no idea how hard

875
01:19:14,888 --> 01:19:16,625
it has been for me.
For ten years,

876
01:19:16,757 --> 01:19:18,492
you kept this away from me. Why?
Honestly, you don't know.

877
01:19:18,627 --> 01:19:20,127
Just why? Why? Why?!
Please. You don't understand.

878
01:19:20,261 --> 01:19:22,129
Because you tried
to kill our family!

879
01:19:24,265 --> 01:19:27,736
You chased us around the house
with a goddamn baseball bat!

880
01:19:29,236 --> 01:19:31,071
What?
I mean, I knew
that it wasn't you.

881
01:19:31,205 --> 01:19:33,073
I knew it was that thing
in those photos.

882
01:19:33,207 --> 01:19:35,543
But the kids?
They don't understand.

883
01:19:35,677 --> 01:19:38,279
All those night terrors
that Foster had.

884
01:19:38,412 --> 01:19:41,382
I've been lying to our children
for a decade,

885
01:19:41,516 --> 01:19:43,417
telling them
those memories aren't real.

886
01:19:43,551 --> 01:19:45,152
"They're just your imagination.

887
01:19:45,286 --> 01:19:47,154
Dad's not gonna hurt you."

888
01:19:47,288 --> 01:19:49,223
I couldn't.
But you did.

889
01:19:50,891 --> 01:19:54,128
Doesn't matter to them
what was controlling you.

890
01:19:54,261 --> 01:19:55,630
What they saw was your face.

891
01:19:55,764 --> 01:19:58,399
It was you who was
causing all that pain.

892
01:20:00,067 --> 01:20:02,469
That's why I pulled away.

893
01:20:02,604 --> 01:20:04,138
I just...

894
01:20:04,271 --> 01:20:06,675
I couldn't live
like that anymore.

895
01:20:18,152 --> 01:20:19,987
You know...

896
01:20:21,589 --> 01:20:23,725
...we could've gotten
through this together.

897
01:20:30,964 --> 01:20:32,132
Is this you?

898
01:20:35,737 --> 01:20:38,038
Dalton just sent this to me.

899
01:20:38,172 --> 01:20:41,275
He's been having nightmares
and visions.

900
01:20:41,408 --> 01:20:43,377
Something about a red door.

901
01:20:45,479 --> 01:20:46,614
And now this.

902
01:20:47,749 --> 01:20:48,982
What do we do?

903
01:21:57,484 --> 01:21:59,219
I'm scared.

904
01:21:59,353 --> 01:22:00,688
It's gonna be okay.

905
01:22:00,822 --> 01:22:02,456
It's gonna be okay.
I don't know...

906
01:22:02,590 --> 01:22:03,924
Hey, nothing's gonna
happen to us.

907
01:22:04,057 --> 01:22:05,926
I promise you, okay?

908
01:22:06,059 --> 01:22:07,629
Take care of your brother,
Dalton.

909
01:22:07,762 --> 01:22:09,631
Okay.

910
01:22:14,702 --> 01:22:16,303
Here.

911
01:22:16,437 --> 01:22:18,606
But why is Daddy mad at us?

912
01:22:33,454 --> 01:22:35,255
Mommy. Mommy.

913
01:22:35,389 --> 01:22:37,291
I can go into the dark place
and find Daddy.

914
01:22:37,424 --> 01:22:38,927
No, no, no, it's too dangerous.

915
01:22:39,059 --> 01:22:40,461
I-I can do it, though.

916
01:22:40,595 --> 01:22:42,129
Okay, just be careful.

917
01:23:34,181 --> 01:23:36,316
No! Stop! What are you doing?!

918
01:23:38,252 --> 01:23:40,220
Stop! What are you doing?!

919
01:23:42,289 --> 01:23:45,459
Dad, please just stop.
Just stop!

920
01:23:45,593 --> 01:23:48,730
No!

921
01:23:48,863 --> 01:23:50,865
Stop!

922
01:24:16,824 --> 01:24:19,426
And now, my dear friends,

923
01:24:19,561 --> 01:24:23,598
I'd like to dedicate this song
to all of you out there,

924
01:24:23,731 --> 01:24:25,600
wherever you may be.

925
01:24:25,733 --> 01:24:29,303
This song is for you.

926
01:24:40,048 --> 01:24:42,584
♪ Fill your heart
with love today ♪

927
01:24:42,717 --> 01:24:46,420
♪ Don't play the game of time ♪

928
01:24:46,554 --> 01:24:50,024
♪ Things that happened
in the past ♪

929
01:24:50,157 --> 01:24:53,061
♪ Happened in your mind ♪

930
01:24:53,193 --> 01:24:55,930
♪ In your mind,
only in your mind ♪

931
01:24:56,064 --> 01:24:57,765
♪ In your mind ♪

932
01:24:57,899 --> 01:25:02,704
♪ Forget your mind,
and you'll be free. ♪

933
01:25:41,174 --> 01:25:43,745
Just checking on you.

934
01:25:48,549 --> 01:25:50,283
Okay.

935
01:25:50,417 --> 01:25:51,819
Sitting on the floor,
being weird.

936
01:25:51,953 --> 01:25:53,588
That's normal.

937
01:25:53,721 --> 01:25:55,590
So you're good, right?

938
01:25:55,723 --> 01:25:57,859
Because I thought
that when the power went out

939
01:25:57,992 --> 01:26:01,194
that maybe you're messing with
that dark realm shit again.

940
01:26:01,328 --> 01:26:03,798
And I know that you
don't really care for the dark,

941
01:26:03,931 --> 01:26:08,536
so I figured
I would illuminate your room,

942
01:26:08,670 --> 01:26:11,371
much like how
I illuminate your life.

943
01:26:11,506 --> 01:26:13,440
I'm not afraid
of the dark anymore.

944
01:26:13,574 --> 01:26:15,208
Okay.

945
01:26:15,342 --> 01:26:17,177
Well, I hauled these
all the way down here,

946
01:26:17,310 --> 01:26:19,914
so they're going up anyway.

947
01:26:20,048 --> 01:26:21,749
Even though they're
totally freaking annoying.

948
01:26:21,883 --> 01:26:23,851
Geez.

949
01:26:24,986 --> 01:26:27,320
So, um, listen.

950
01:26:29,222 --> 01:26:31,893
I got your text,
and I wrote a snarky response,

951
01:26:32,026 --> 01:26:33,761
and then I deleted it,
because Grandma Perkee

952
01:26:33,895 --> 01:26:36,564
always told me to never
escalate an argument over text.

953
01:26:36,698 --> 01:26:38,231
Doesn't convey tone.

954
01:26:40,535 --> 01:26:43,504
But, I mean,
if you want my opinion,

955
01:26:43,638 --> 01:26:46,074
here it is.

956
01:26:46,206 --> 01:26:49,744
Don't go digging around
in your past.

957
01:26:49,877 --> 01:26:52,680
Some things are just better
left buried, you know?

958
01:26:52,814 --> 01:26:57,185
And sometimes
you just have to move on.

959
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:08,763
Dalton?

960
01:27:48,368 --> 01:27:49,269
Hey.

961
01:28:07,454 --> 01:28:08,388
Dalton.

962
01:28:09,422 --> 01:28:10,591
You okay?

963
01:28:23,171 --> 01:28:26,207
♪ Knee-deep ♪

964
01:28:26,339 --> 01:28:29,610
♪ In flowers, we'll stray ♪

965
01:28:29,744 --> 01:28:35,550
♪ We'll keep the showers away ♪

966
01:28:35,683 --> 01:28:39,821
♪ And if I kiss you
in the garden ♪

967
01:28:39,954 --> 01:28:41,488
♪ In the moonlight ♪

968
01:28:41,622 --> 01:28:43,390
♪ Will you pardon me ♪

969
01:28:43,524 --> 01:28:45,059
♪ And tiptoe ♪

970
01:28:45,193 --> 01:28:50,264
♪ Through the tulips with me? ♪

971
01:28:58,639 --> 01:29:00,675
Dalton.

972
01:29:10,251 --> 01:29:11,552
Dalton.

973
01:29:31,305 --> 01:29:32,405
Dalton?

974
01:29:38,079 --> 01:29:40,014
No.

975
01:29:45,152 --> 01:29:46,220
Oh, no.

976
01:29:46,354 --> 01:29:48,756
No, no, no!

977
01:29:53,661 --> 01:29:55,563
Daddy's here.

978
01:29:55,696 --> 01:29:57,832
I'm gonna get you out
of this place, Dalton.

979
01:30:09,409 --> 01:30:11,746
We're gonna get out of here,
and we're gonna get home, okay?

980
01:30:11,879 --> 01:30:13,180
We're never going back there.

981
01:30:20,755 --> 01:30:22,422
Dalton. What?

982
01:30:39,373 --> 01:30:40,408
Dalton?

983
01:30:44,378 --> 01:30:46,247
Dalton, tell me
you're in there.

984
01:30:47,114 --> 01:30:48,149
Dalton.

985
01:30:49,250 --> 01:30:51,919
Dalton, I know you're in there,

986
01:30:52,053 --> 01:30:54,322
but if you touch me again,
I'm gonna fuck you up.

987
01:31:11,205 --> 01:31:12,273
Dad, no!

988
01:31:22,116 --> 01:31:23,150
You tried to kill me.

989
01:31:23,284 --> 01:31:24,484
It wasn't me.

990
01:31:24,618 --> 01:31:26,287
I saw you.

991
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:29,190
Dalton, these things,
they can possess our bodies.

992
01:31:29,323 --> 01:31:31,525
It happened to me,
and now he's done it to you.

993
01:31:34,729 --> 01:31:36,063
He's coming back for you.

994
01:31:37,765 --> 01:31:40,234
We've got to go.

995
01:31:43,671 --> 01:31:45,239
Come on.

996
01:32:24,779 --> 01:32:27,181
He's coming. Go.

997
01:32:31,986 --> 01:32:33,220
Dalton, help me!

998
01:32:34,889 --> 01:32:36,424
Dalton, come help me
hold the door!

999
01:32:51,739 --> 01:32:53,574
No!

1000
01:32:53,707 --> 01:32:55,209
We can't hold it back, Dad.

1001
01:32:55,342 --> 01:32:57,611
Son, we got to try.

1002
01:33:01,148 --> 01:33:02,616
Go! Get away!

1003
01:33:10,858 --> 01:33:12,860
No! No!

1004
01:33:12,993 --> 01:33:14,261
Dalton, come on!

1005
01:33:14,395 --> 01:33:15,896
We're gonna have to find
s-something to block it,

1006
01:33:16,030 --> 01:33:16,964
something to seal it!

1007
01:33:22,670 --> 01:33:23,771
Come on. Let's go.

1008
01:33:25,606 --> 01:33:27,074
Dad, please.

1009
01:33:27,208 --> 01:33:28,809
Dad, we have to go!

1010
01:33:33,714 --> 01:33:34,982
It's okay.

1011
01:33:36,585 --> 01:33:37,618
You go.

1012
01:33:42,957 --> 01:33:44,191
Go.

1013
01:33:56,437 --> 01:33:58,939
Get away!

1014
01:34:06,814 --> 01:34:07,915
No!

1015
01:34:17,324 --> 01:34:18,527
No! Oh, God.

1016
01:34:20,629 --> 01:34:22,429
Josh.

1017
01:34:23,565 --> 01:34:24,865
Josh.

1018
01:34:27,134 --> 01:34:29,870
This ends with me.

1019
01:35:11,478 --> 01:35:12,479
Paint?

1020
01:35:18,786 --> 01:35:20,522
Paint. Dalton.

1021
01:36:21,015 --> 01:36:22,483
You need
to get rid of that thing.

1022
01:36:22,617 --> 01:36:23,984
Burn it. Forget about it.

1023
01:36:24,118 --> 01:36:25,754
No, no,
forgetting it doesn't work.

1024
01:36:25,886 --> 01:36:27,888
We need to remember.

1025
01:36:28,022 --> 01:36:29,923
Even the things
that hurt.

1026
01:37:05,794 --> 01:37:07,061
Dad?

1027
01:38:30,911 --> 01:38:33,213
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1028
01:38:37,151 --> 01:38:39,453
Is Dalton okay?
He's okay.

1029
01:38:39,587 --> 01:38:41,188
Okay.

1030
01:38:43,625 --> 01:38:45,760
That's him.

1031
01:38:47,294 --> 01:38:49,196
Dalton.
Is Dad back?

1032
01:38:49,329 --> 01:38:51,833
Yes. Yeah, he's back.
He's okay.

1033
01:38:53,033 --> 01:38:54,569
Are you okay?

1034
01:39:22,697 --> 01:39:24,632
I'll see you next Friday.

1035
01:39:24,766 --> 01:39:26,400
And tell Foster to pack
his history homework.

1036
01:39:26,534 --> 01:39:28,503
I'll help him with it.

1037
01:39:28,636 --> 01:39:31,606
Could come a little earlier
if you want, join us for dinner.

1038
01:39:32,973 --> 01:39:34,174
Yeah, I'd like that.

1039
01:39:34,308 --> 01:39:35,309
Okay.
Thanks.

1040
01:39:57,866 --> 01:40:01,068
Lovely home.
Oh, thanks.

1041
01:40:01,201 --> 01:40:04,304
Do you live here?
Uh, I hope so.

1042
01:40:04,438 --> 01:40:06,473
That's a weird answer.

1043
01:40:06,608 --> 01:40:09,042
Guess I'm just
lost in memories.

1044
01:40:09,176 --> 01:40:11,378
They can flood the mind.

1045
01:40:19,086 --> 01:40:20,688
I know you.

1046
01:40:22,991 --> 01:40:25,392
May have seen me around.

1047
01:40:25,527 --> 01:40:26,861
I know your mother.

1048
01:40:31,799 --> 01:40:33,968
There's so much
I want to tell her.

1049
01:40:34,101 --> 01:40:35,970
I know.

1050
01:40:36,103 --> 01:40:37,805
And you can.

1051
01:40:37,939 --> 01:40:39,373
And you will.

1052
01:40:39,507 --> 01:40:40,675
Someday.

1053
01:40:40,808 --> 01:40:43,545
You have a bright future ahead.

1054
01:40:43,678 --> 01:40:45,078
You and Dalton.

1055
01:40:48,816 --> 01:40:50,785
Keep a steady stride, Josh.

1056
01:42:09,162 --> 01:42:10,364
Wow.

1057
01:42:13,101 --> 01:42:15,603
I made the wall.

1058
01:42:17,939 --> 01:42:19,507
Yeah.

1059
01:42:21,042 --> 01:42:22,810
I love you, son.

1060
01:42:22,944 --> 01:42:24,444
