1
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:23,983
Every family is a story.

2
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:34,233
Every family is a ghost story.

3
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,159
Lottery ticket?

4
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:45,859
Not this time.

5
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:53,674
Careful out there.

6
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,972
You have a good night.

7
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,308
- Hello?
- Why?

8
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,283
Chick?

9
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:39,911
- Why?
- Chick, listen...

10
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:42,182
I wasn't even invited?

11
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:44,281
It was their idea.

12
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:46,292
- They thought it was...
- That what?

13
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,421
Safe, or I was going
to do something?

14
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:52,762
I don't know.

15
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,562
I'm a monster now,
is that it?

16
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:55,897
I'm sorry.

17
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,369
- It's complicated.
- I wasn't invited

18
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:59,201
to my own daughter's wedding.

19
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:01,434
- Look, Chick, she's not a kid anymore,
- Never mind.

20
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:02,703
and if she was worried...

21
00:04:02,777 --> 00:04:05,678
- Cathy.
- What?

22
00:04:06,147 --> 00:04:07,808
Sorry, Cathy.

23
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,339
Where are you going?

24
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:13,616
Where are you going?

25
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:16,646
Home.

26
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,557
Damn!

27
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:58,042
Come on, Charley!

28
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,520
Run! Run! Run! Run!

29
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,476
Mom?

30
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:35,746
All right, come on, let's go.
Dive, dive!

31
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,190
- Oh, man!
- Good work!

32
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:41,753
- Which one's yours?
- None.

33
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,286
We don't...

34
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:46,333
I was just closing
on a house nearby.

35
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,732
Okay, you're a baseball fan?

36
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,064
Sort of.

37
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,196
I write about sports
for a newspaper.

38
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:57,038
That guy over there,
he's a story.

39
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,340
Oh, yeah?

40
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:01,438
Chick Benetto.

41
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:03,881
Made the World Series in '73.

42
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:05,782
Supposed to be dead by now,

43
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,651
from what I hear.

44
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:11,452
Anyhow, he's a story.

45
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:14,788
Maybe I'm not looking
for a story.

46
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,777
All right, guys!

47
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:34,303
Go to first!

48
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,508
Come on, dive, dive!

49
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:41,118
You want to know why

50
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:44,556
I tried to kill myself, right?

51
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:48,527
Where I've been, all that?

52
00:08:48,596 --> 00:08:51,463
But mostly, why I tried to kill myself.

53
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:56,398
It's okay, everybody does.

54
00:08:57,438 --> 00:09:00,430
It's like they measure
themselves against me.

55
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:02,340
They figure

56
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:06,107
that I crossed some kind of line,

57
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,204
and they want to know

58
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:10,011
if they could ever get
as close as I did.

59
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:12,909
You gonna sit?

60
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:20,524
People are wrong.

61
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,860
There's no line.

62
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,398
There's only your life,

63
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:26,728
how you mess it up,

64
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,859
and who's there to save you.

65
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:31,496
Or who isn't.

66
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:23,488
I'm sorry you didn't

67
00:10:24,525 --> 00:10:26,789
get a chance to say
good-bye, Daddy.

68
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:34,425
Your mother lived a good life.

69
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,903
Stop blaming yourself.

70
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:42,873
I was in the car.

71
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:46,038
- I was on my way...
- It was her heart.

72
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:49,105
You couldn't have known.

73
00:10:50,718 --> 00:10:52,379
She lived 70 years,

74
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,412
I was gone for one day.

75
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,355
One day.
What kind of...

76
00:11:01,362 --> 00:11:04,354
How could this happen?

77
00:11:11,372 --> 00:11:13,932
That's not going
to bring her back.

78
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:41,156
The only thing that would eliminate
the pitching change

79
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:46,730
is if Henry can get Valet
to do an inning-ending double-play.

80
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:49,469
One ball, one strike.

81
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:56,839
And she has sealed
Barry's booth.

82
00:11:57,885 --> 00:12:00,012
He cannot see or hear
what is going on...

83
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:02,085
Try the double dare.

84
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:04,613
Okay, if it works for you,

85
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:05,919
he misses again.

86
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:07,984
You receive an additional $200.

87
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,858
You will then have
a commanding...

88
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,626
I'm no good at it, Catherine.

89
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:15,133
It's Maria, Dad.

90
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:16,863
Maria.

91
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:19,564
I'm sorry, sweetie.

92
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,041
It's okay.

93
00:12:26,547 --> 00:12:28,538
Look at me.

94
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,245
I want you to promise me
something, okay?

95
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,777
Okay.

96
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,823
When you get older,

97
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,983
you do what you love.

98
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:41,084
You understand?
You do what you love.

99
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:43,823
Maria, go to your room.

100
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:46,092
- Mom, I was...
- Promise me.

101
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,963
Now.

102
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:09,044
Don't say it.

103
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,682
- Chick...
- It's a slump, Mike.

104
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:13,123
It's a pretty damn long one.

105
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:15,058
- Mike...
- I've been looking out for you, but...

106
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,618
I just got to get
my swing back.

107
00:13:16,697 --> 00:13:19,530
You can swing better
when you can see straight.

108
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,862
It's 9:30.

109
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:23,425
What time did you have
your first drink?

110
00:13:23,504 --> 00:13:26,098
Damn it, Chick,
you got a wife and kid.

111
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:28,434
I know it's been hard
since your mom died...

112
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,876
- Listen, Mike,
- No, you listen to me.

113
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:33,913
I'm done,
I'm out of excuses.

114
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:35,744
It's a year now.

115
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,408
You got two sits left this week.

116
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,111
You got to convert one of them.

117
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,312
That's it, buddy.

118
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:42,218
Bottom of the ninth.

119
00:13:43,457 --> 00:13:45,982
Now, who do you have later?

120
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,119
I don't know, Peterson.

121
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,461
Peterson, good.

122
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:53,830
Warm him up.

123
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:55,596
Come on, talk to him
about baseball.

124
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:57,534
All these guys wanted
to be an athlete,

125
00:13:57,604 --> 00:13:59,265
just like you were.

126
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,332
Okay.

127
00:14:04,745 --> 00:14:05,973
For God's sake, Chick,

128
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:10,006
stay a few drinks behind him.

129
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,686
I get up to bat.

130
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,916
As a catcher,

131
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,480
I figure I can steal a sign

132
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,459
from the second baseman.

133
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,518
I see him,
he signals fastball.

134
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:23,893
Now, I'm all set.

135
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:26,489
I'm gonna smack that pitch,

136
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:28,933
except the signs are reversed.

137
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,867
Perry throws a curve.

138
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:32,235
Wicked cheese.

139
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:34,604
I miss so badly, I fall over,

140
00:14:34,675 --> 00:14:36,302
I mean, down.

141
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,638
Gaylord Perry.

142
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,474
He was something.

143
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:40,535
Lived on a spitball.

144
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:42,411
Now, back to the new binder line.

145
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:45,383
I'm not sure
we want to switch...

146
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:48,285
You couldn't hit
that damn pitch.

147
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:51,620
- You know, stay where we are.
- Dropped like that.

148
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,555
It must've been something.

149
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,196
Yeah.

150
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:15,876
I'm open!

151
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,389
I'm open!

152
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:36,029
Pass it, pass it!

153
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,639
Hey.

154
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:44,773
You ever hear
of sharing the ball?

155
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:48,246
- Benetto, come on.
- No, no.

156
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,249
You're supposed
to teach them, right?

157
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:52,114
This is a school?

158
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:55,382
In school,
you're supposed to teach.

159
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,386
Passing is not that hard.

160
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:00,757
You give up the ball,

161
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,590
then somebody else
on your team

162
00:16:02,663 --> 00:16:04,028
gets to shoot it.

163
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,587
I played ball.

164
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,293
I know what I'm talking about.

165
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,267
- Daddy, please!
- No!

166
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:12,362
No. I'll show you. See?

167
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,600
You dribble, you dribble,

168
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:17,269
then you give it up.

169
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:18,611
Come on, Maria, honey,

170
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,638
you got to catch the easy ones.

171
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:36,124
This is not gonna be pleasant, folks,

172
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:40,622
I can tell you this right now.

173
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:41,759
Tie-breaking run,

174
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,200
standing down at third base,

175
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,101
and the person at one,
Cecil Espy.

176
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:47,902
Only one batter is going to retire...

177
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:57,678
Better catch it!

178
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:01,220
I smoked for 12 years,

179
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:04,985
and within just one day
of using Smoke Away,

180
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:06,753
I was done.

181
00:17:06,827 --> 00:17:10,729
I haven't had a cigarette
in two years.

182
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:13,561
Do you want to walk
with your $2,000 in cash?

183
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:16,727
Or do you want to play
for $60,000 more?

184
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:22,007
He is dealing to Deivi Cruz
for strike one.

185
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:24,772
Lyon coming in from Triple A...

186
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:51,226
Hello?

187
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:56,106
I wasn't invited
to my own daughter's wedding?

188
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:58,576
Look, Chick, she's
not a kid anymore.

189
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,968
Damn!

190
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:53,429
Mom?

191
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:57,995
Mom?

192
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:05,977
Mom?

193
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,411
Mom.

194
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:11,196
That's enough.

195
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:13,728
Finish your homework.

196
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:06,751
Charley?

197
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:09,894
Charley, is that you?

198
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,296
Come on, come on,
stop it, stop it.

199
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:14,526
What are you doing here?

200
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:16,535
You're making a mess!

201
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:19,501
Well, you look like hell.

202
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:26,441
What's going on?
You're all cut up.

203
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,176
What's the matter?

204
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:36,781
I don't expect you
to believe me.

205
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,122
People don't see ghosts, I know.

206
00:22:42,996 --> 00:22:44,429
What did she look like?

207
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:48,798
Like the last time
I saw her alive.

208
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,132
She was right there
in front of me.

209
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:53,638
I wasn't drunk.

210
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,367
But she'd been dead for...

211
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:56,773
Nine years.

212
00:22:59,646 --> 00:23:01,705
I don't know how
to explain it.

213
00:23:02,749 --> 00:23:04,410
Try.

214
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,182
It's like jumping
off the planet.

215
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:10,280
There's what you think,

216
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:12,483
and then there's
what happens.

217
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,857
I saw my mother alive,

218
00:23:14,928 --> 00:23:16,987
right in front of my eyes.

219
00:23:17,197 --> 00:23:19,791
I knew it was impossible.

220
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:23,826
But I didn't want it to end.

221
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:34,811
Does it sting?

222
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:39,409
I must have more of these

223
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:42,444
in the house somewhere.

224
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:43,749
Mom.

225
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,191
No, just hold still
a minute, will you?

226
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,194
Mom, what is this?

227
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:52,231
It's poison.
I'm poisoning you.

228
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:53,697
It's antiseptic.

229
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,758
Now, just hold still for a second.

230
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:02,031
Oh, Charley.

231
00:24:03,076 --> 00:24:06,443
The trouble you get yourself into.

232
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:21,627
Oh, that's too hard for you.

233
00:24:22,662 --> 00:24:26,428
Let's see if we can find you

234
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:29,297
something better than that.

235
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:37,237
Oh, hey, kiddo.

236
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:40,007
Give your mother a kiss.

237
00:24:41,414 --> 00:24:42,881
<i>Curious George?</i>

238
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:46,147
You've read that
ten times already.

239
00:24:46,219 --> 00:24:49,484
- Yeah?
- Yes, you mean.

240
00:24:49,556 --> 00:24:50,853
I wanted a different book

241
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:53,984
but the lady wouldn't
let me have it.

242
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,755
Why not?

243
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:05,596
I am Mrs. Benetto,
and this is my son Charley.

244
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:07,970
Did you tell him that a book

245
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:09,872
was too hard for him to read?

246
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:11,171
Don't you shush me.

247
00:25:11,244 --> 00:25:14,179
Did you tell my son
that a book was too hard?

248
00:25:14,247 --> 00:25:17,478
<i>He wanted
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.</i>

249
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,142
He's not ready.

250
00:25:19,219 --> 00:25:21,619
He's not...

251
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:23,121
How would you know that?

252
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:25,953
Well, I've been helping children...

253
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,152
Never tell a child

254
00:25:28,228 --> 00:25:30,093
that something is
too hard for them,

255
00:25:30,163 --> 00:25:33,098
and never this child.

256
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:34,326
Where's the book?

257
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,424
Now, just a mo...

258
00:25:36,469 --> 00:25:38,699
Where's the book?

259
00:25:45,812 --> 00:25:47,370
Okay, now you get a broom

260
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:51,315
and clean up that mess
on the floor.

261
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:53,784
I'll make you some breakfast.

262
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:55,013
You have something to drink?

263
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:56,650
You need to eat.

264
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,453
I don't feel like eating.

265
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:01,083
Get the broom, please.

266
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,628
Oh, look at you.

267
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:06,130
You're just a disaster.

268
00:26:06,199 --> 00:26:08,167
It's out back.

269
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:10,794
Go, go, go, go, go.

270
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:28,380
Hi, Dad.

271
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:34,787
One.

272
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:39,760
Dad, what makes an echo?

273
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:46,235
My teacher says I have
to recite on Monday

274
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:48,706
what makes an echo.

275
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:50,072
You do your calisthenics today?

276
00:26:50,143 --> 00:26:52,270
Because you're never gonna
make it into the big leagues

277
00:26:52,345 --> 00:26:53,607
unless you do your calisthenics.

278
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,840
Yes, sir.

279
00:26:54,914 --> 00:26:56,381
Doesn't it happen
in the mountains?

280
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:58,440
An echo?

281
00:26:58,584 --> 00:26:59,846
I guess.

282
00:27:00,887 --> 00:27:02,149
Weren't you in the mountains,

283
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:04,519
in the war?

284
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,581
When you were in Italy?

285
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,060
Put the pencil back.

286
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:11,996
I'll just ask Mom.

287
00:27:12,065 --> 00:27:13,692
Hey, you want
to talk about school

288
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:15,131
or you want to play ball?

289
00:27:15,201 --> 00:27:17,931
Go around back,
I'll throw you some.

290
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:20,996
First, calisthenics.

291
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:22,438
Excuse me?

292
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:25,444
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

293
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:27,979
All the way down.

294
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,843
Chick, go out back
and do them.

295
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:35,319
- But I can do them right...
- Chick!

296
00:27:44,364 --> 00:27:45,558
Okay, let's go,
ready position,

297
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:47,793
eye on the ball.

298
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:49,630
Step forward on the throw.

299
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:51,067
Good.

300
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:52,331
A little bit more.

301
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:53,736
I can catch it.

302
00:27:53,806 --> 00:27:55,467
See, I'm not afraid of the ball.

303
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:57,771
Don't be afraid of the ball.

304
00:27:57,844 --> 00:27:59,072
Chick, you're doing it again.

305
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:00,373
I said don't be afraid.

306
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:02,380
It's not gonna hurt you.

307
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:04,075
Aw, come on.
Run, run, run, run, run.

308
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,845
He's stealing second,
let's go!

309
00:28:05,918 --> 00:28:07,681
There you go,
nice job.

310
00:28:07,754 --> 00:28:08,948
You got to be tough.

311
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,251
You can't back away
from the ball.

312
00:28:13,493 --> 00:28:15,984
All right,
let me hit some to you.

313
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,395
Ready? Okay.

314
00:28:19,465 --> 00:28:21,194
I took care of it.

315
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:23,633
Sit for breakfast.

316
00:28:26,506 --> 00:28:28,667
I made them the way
you like them,

317
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:31,768
with greenies.

318
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:33,277
What?

319
00:28:33,346 --> 00:28:35,007
You don't remember?

320
00:28:35,081 --> 00:28:37,777
Chives, you used to
call them "greenies."

321
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,875
What time is it?

322
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:42,750
Why? You go someplace
more important to be?

323
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:45,552
Well, it doesn't
matter then, does it?

324
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:48,183
Oh, your toast.

325
00:28:49,762 --> 00:28:50,990
Here.

326
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:54,295
You can spend a day
with your mother.

327
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:55,800
How about that?

328
00:28:55,868 --> 00:28:57,927
With you?

329
00:28:58,004 --> 00:28:59,995
You got another mother?

330
00:29:02,675 --> 00:29:04,006
You know, the doctor says

331
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:07,945
you shouldn't eat salt.

332
00:29:08,014 --> 00:29:09,345
High blood pressure,

333
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:12,407
they say it takes
five years off your life.

334
00:29:12,485 --> 00:29:13,782
I say, what five years?

335
00:29:13,853 --> 00:29:16,117
From 85 to 90?

336
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:17,781
Keep 'em.
I'd rather have salt.

337
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:19,552
Mom?

338
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:20,751
Here, have some.

339
00:29:20,827 --> 00:29:22,454
- Mom!
- What?

340
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:24,428
This is impossible!

341
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:31,426
Eat.

342
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:44,441
This lasagna still ain't right.

343
00:29:45,485 --> 00:29:46,952
I've tried ten different ways, Len.

344
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:48,384
I don't know what you want.

345
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:51,252
We play the Red Sox Saturday.

346
00:29:51,324 --> 00:29:52,757
Yeah, what are you gonna do?

347
00:29:52,825 --> 00:29:55,316
- Three hits and no strikeouts.
- That's right.

348
00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:57,487
Strikeouts are for losers.
No sympathy for losers.

349
00:29:57,563 --> 00:29:59,497
- You got that?
- Got it.

350
00:29:59,565 --> 00:30:01,032
That's what you're
teaching him?

351
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,397
No, this still ain't right.

352
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:05,062
You make it next time.

353
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,570
You know what?

354
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:07,833
When I was a kid,

355
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:09,169
there was no Little League.

356
00:30:09,242 --> 00:30:10,641
I had to work on Saturdays.

357
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,870
I'll tell you what, though.

358
00:30:11,944 --> 00:30:14,139
If I had half the chance
that you have,

359
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:15,441
I wouldn't strike out.

360
00:30:15,515 --> 00:30:17,142
I'd get some wood on that ball.

361
00:30:17,216 --> 00:30:18,547
Strikeouts,

362
00:30:18,618 --> 00:30:21,018
they're a waste of time
is what they are.

363
00:30:21,354 --> 00:30:22,844
Mommy?

364
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,087
How did Daddy and you
get "gaged?"

365
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,421
"Engaged," you mean?

366
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:30,587
Chick, give me the bread.

367
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:32,062
I told you, sweetheart.

368
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:34,861
Daddy sent me a nice letter

369
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:35,866
from Italy.

370
00:30:35,902 --> 00:30:37,267
During the war.

371
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,894
You know, there's more to life

372
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:40,097
than baseball, Len.

373
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,037
He's fine.
Aren't you, Chick?

374
00:30:42,108 --> 00:30:44,042
His name is Charley.

375
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,372
I like Chick.

376
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:47,674
You just have him ready by noon.

377
00:30:47,747 --> 00:30:49,374
I'll be coming from the new store.

378
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:50,915
One more headache
we don't need.

379
00:30:50,983 --> 00:30:52,883
Hey, two stores,
twice the income.

380
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:55,352
I get it going, you won't have to work
at that hospital anymore.

381
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:56,513
Well, if anyone's interested,

382
00:30:56,589 --> 00:30:58,216
I enjoy working at that hospital.

383
00:30:58,291 --> 00:31:00,759
I'm a good nurse.

384
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:02,993
What's wrong?

385
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,225
It's not right.

386
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:07,823
You see?

387
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,630
Even the kid knows.

388
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:14,100
Thank you.

389
00:31:15,141 --> 00:31:17,405
For what?

390
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:19,467
For breakfast.

391
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:21,706
Well, you're welcome

392
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:24,649
for breakfast.

393
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:25,979
We should go.

394
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:29,044
I just want to put on
some lipstick.

395
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,563
Not until you're older.

396
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:51,204
Mom, can me and Roberta

397
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,404
<i>watch The Rifleman?</i>

398
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:55,811
Roberta and I.

399
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:57,678
Roberta and I.

400
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:58,842
And no,

401
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:00,977
we're having a party.

402
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:02,281
Read.

403
00:32:02,355 --> 00:32:04,289
"An echo.

404
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:07,258
"The persistence of sound

405
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:10,261
after the source has stopped."

406
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:12,661
And when can
you hear an echo?

407
00:32:12,732 --> 00:32:14,165
"When it is quiet,

408
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:18,033
and all other sounds
have been absorbed."

409
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:19,833
Why do I have to do this?

410
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:21,338
Because if you're good in school,

411
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:23,238
you get to go to college.

412
00:32:23,676 --> 00:32:25,200
Give your mother a hand.

413
00:32:35,488 --> 00:32:36,750
Thank you.

414
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,052
You're welcome.

415
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:40,956
Charley, don't mumble.

416
00:32:41,027 --> 00:32:42,153
It makes you sound
uneducated.

417
00:32:42,228 --> 00:32:43,695
Posey, let's go!
People are coming.

418
00:32:43,763 --> 00:32:46,027
She's got lipstick
all over her face.

419
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:48,866
I'll get it!

420
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:50,367
Don't run!

421
00:32:50,603 --> 00:32:52,093
We'll finish this later.

422
00:32:58,444 --> 00:33:00,435
You want to be a mama's boy?

423
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:12,685
Let me tell you something, Chick.

424
00:33:13,726 --> 00:33:16,194
You could be a mama's boy,

425
00:33:16,262 --> 00:33:19,231
or you could be a daddy's boy.

426
00:33:19,298 --> 00:33:21,664
But you can't be both.

427
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:24,066
You got that?

428
00:33:26,072 --> 00:33:29,064
Wipe the lipstick
off your face.

429
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:38,338
Thank you.

430
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:40,640
Where are we going?

431
00:34:40,713 --> 00:34:42,772
We're gonna pay a visit.

432
00:34:42,848 --> 00:34:45,817
But first, I want
to show you something.

433
00:34:45,885 --> 00:34:47,318
Ma, what are you doing here?

434
00:34:47,386 --> 00:34:48,683
I live here.

435
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,984
Not anymore.

436
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:53,923
Then why did you come back?

437
00:34:53,993 --> 00:34:55,984
I don't know.

438
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:58,560
The house...

439
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:02,333
Tell us what happened.

440
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:06,668
Charles, what happened?

441
00:35:06,739 --> 00:35:08,138
You want to talk about this?

442
00:35:08,207 --> 00:35:09,196
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

443
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:11,038
You can't be here.

444
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,771
Why not?

445
00:35:12,845 --> 00:35:14,870
Because you died.

446
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:18,145
Oh, Charley.

447
00:35:19,151 --> 00:35:22,143
You make too much of things.

448
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,281
Come on.

449
00:35:31,597 --> 00:35:34,259
What happened to you?

450
00:35:37,036 --> 00:35:39,436
Are you in any pain?

451
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:43,441
I haven't been so good, Mom.

452
00:35:46,412 --> 00:35:49,404
What I want to show you
is over there.

453
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:53,785
First three years
I was married to your father,

454
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,084
I couldn't get pregnant.

455
00:35:57,156 --> 00:35:59,215
People thought there was
something wrong with me.

456
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:00,986
Well, so did I.

457
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,722
I hope it's still there.

458
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,662
That's... There it is, look.

459
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:11,101
"Please"?

460
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:14,296
What is it?

461
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:18,174
It's a prayer.

462
00:36:18,244 --> 00:36:20,906
I carved it one night.

463
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,971
For a child.

464
00:36:23,382 --> 00:36:25,373
For you.

465
00:36:28,888 --> 00:36:32,187
So, Charley,
whatever is going on,

466
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:36,194
just know that
from the very start,

467
00:36:36,262 --> 00:36:39,595
you were an answer
to my prayer.

468
00:36:42,768 --> 00:36:44,736
So, now you know
how much you were

469
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:48,262
wanted.

470
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,399
I think children
forget that sometimes,

471
00:36:50,476 --> 00:36:51,636
you know?

472
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:55,339
They start thinking
of themselves as a burden,

473
00:36:55,414 --> 00:36:57,279
instead of...

474
00:36:58,484 --> 00:37:01,146
a wish granted.

475
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:09,189
- Come on, Chick!
- Let's go, Chicky.

476
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:12,493
Now's your time, son.
Now's your time.

477
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:13,724
You wait for your pitch.

478
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:14,959
You wait for your pitch, son.

479
00:37:15,034 --> 00:37:16,558
- You wait for your pitch.
- Yea, Charley!

480
00:37:16,635 --> 00:37:18,967
Let's go!
Keep your elbow up.

481
00:37:19,038 --> 00:37:20,403
Keep your elbow up.

482
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:22,497
Keep your hands together.
Keep your eye on the ball.

483
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,166
Keep your eye on the ball.

484
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,935
- Strike!
- Good cut, good cut.

485
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,971
Come on, Charley!

486
00:37:30,049 --> 00:37:31,482
There's nothing up there
that can help you, Chicky.

487
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,177
There's nothing up there
that can help you.

488
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:34,617
Keep your eye on the ball!

489
00:37:34,687 --> 00:37:36,712
Let's go, son!
Let's go!

490
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:46,695
Dig, dig, dig!
Run, run, run!

491
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:48,995
Dig, dig, that a boy!

492
00:37:49,068 --> 00:37:50,501
That's the way we want it.
Come on.

493
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:52,332
Get back to that base.
Let's go, let's go.

494
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:54,599
That's what I'm talking about.
That's what I'm talking about.

495
00:37:54,673 --> 00:37:56,106
See what happens
when you listen to me?

496
00:37:56,175 --> 00:37:58,109
Next time, don't look
at the ball when you hit it,

497
00:37:58,177 --> 00:37:59,439
you just run,
you run it out.

498
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:01,741
Nobody on. One out.

499
00:38:01,814 --> 00:38:04,544
Wynn cuts loose,
a change, it's high.

500
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,311
One and one.

501
00:38:08,921 --> 00:38:11,481
Dad, what's your favorite drink?

502
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:14,321
Something you're
too young to have.

503
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:16,657
Mine's champagne.

504
00:38:16,729 --> 00:38:17,889
Champagne, huh?

505
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:19,555
That's what they
pour on your head

506
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:22,657
when you win
the World Series.

507
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:26,464
Here, clean your face.

508
00:38:27,606 --> 00:38:28,868
You know, the only way

509
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:32,536
you get to the World Series
is by practicing.

510
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:34,272
You understand?

511
00:38:34,346 --> 00:38:36,678
You don't practice,
you're gonna be ordinary.

512
00:38:36,749 --> 00:38:38,080
You want to be ordinary?

513
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:40,344
Good, because you're not.

514
00:38:41,387 --> 00:38:42,979
And when I win
the World Series,

515
00:38:43,055 --> 00:38:45,080
I'm gonna pour champagne
on your head.

516
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:47,315
I got to get to the new store.

517
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,386
- Maybe we...
- I said I got to go.

518
00:38:51,463 --> 00:38:53,260
Hey.

519
00:38:53,332 --> 00:38:55,425
You be ready
in the morning, okay?

520
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:56,934
Get the mud off your cleats

521
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:59,027
- and you look sharp.
- Okay.

522
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:01,436
And don't tell your mother
about the ice cream.

523
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:02,804
It's our secret, okay?

524
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:05,275
Our secret.

525
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:25,161
Every pitch, every swing,

526
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:28,792
I thought about my father.

527
00:39:49,822 --> 00:39:51,483
Oh, hey, Miss Thelma.

528
00:39:52,524 --> 00:39:53,616
Morning, Chickadoo.

529
00:39:53,692 --> 00:39:55,353
Where's my dad?

530
00:39:55,427 --> 00:39:57,292
Your mother's in the kitchen.

531
00:40:02,301 --> 00:40:04,098
Turn it off, Charley.

532
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:09,435
I'll have cereal.

533
00:40:13,145 --> 00:40:15,477
What time is your game?

534
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:18,380
Mom, do you have a cold?

535
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:21,510
No, honey.

536
00:40:21,587 --> 00:40:23,384
What time is your game?

537
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:25,616
I don't know.
Dad knows.

538
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:28,182
I'll take you,

539
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,160
whatever time it is.

540
00:40:30,229 --> 00:40:32,356
Why can't Dad take me?

541
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:34,490
Your father's not here.

542
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:37,558
Well, when's Dad coming home?

543
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,401
Mom?

544
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:43,602
When's Dad coming home?

545
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:01,119
Rose got too frail

546
00:41:02,161 --> 00:41:04,891
to go to the beauty shop, so...

547
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,864
You know, old people
like to look nice too.

548
00:41:07,933 --> 00:41:09,662
So she's alive.

549
00:41:09,735 --> 00:41:12,033
Of course she's alive.

550
00:41:12,104 --> 00:41:14,038
So are you.

551
00:41:19,845 --> 00:41:21,540
Hello, Rose.

552
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:26,108
You remember my son Charley?

553
00:41:26,185 --> 00:41:28,312
You came!

554
00:41:28,387 --> 00:41:29,911
Well, sure I did.

555
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:32,479
You called me, remember?

556
00:42:10,462 --> 00:42:12,123
Continued sunny and mild,

557
00:42:13,165 --> 00:42:14,632
with highs around 70 degrees.

558
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,224
How are your children, Rose?

559
00:42:16,301 --> 00:42:18,963
Oh, they call me once a week,

560
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,504
like a chore.

561
00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:22,467
You get old and sick,

562
00:42:23,508 --> 00:42:25,203
they get afraid,

563
00:42:25,277 --> 00:42:28,440
like they're gonna
catch something.

564
00:42:28,513 --> 00:42:31,914
You were never afraid, dear.

565
00:42:31,984 --> 00:42:33,542
Thank you.

566
00:42:33,819 --> 00:42:37,619
And you're the best
hairdresser in town.

567
00:42:38,657 --> 00:42:40,090
Oh, you're sweet.

568
00:42:40,158 --> 00:42:42,422
She was a nurse first.

569
00:42:42,494 --> 00:42:44,121
Well, that was a long time ago.

570
00:42:44,196 --> 00:42:46,926
Does your mother cut your hair too?

571
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:48,091
Oh, no.

572
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:49,633
Charley would never
let me touch it.

573
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:51,293
He always insisted

574
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:52,837
on going to a barber shop.

575
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:56,635
Children get embarrassed
by their parents.

576
00:42:56,708 --> 00:42:58,107
Well, any child

577
00:42:58,176 --> 00:43:01,168
who's embarrassed by his mother

578
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:04,647
is a child that hasn't
lived long enough.

579
00:43:06,718 --> 00:43:08,686
Give me.

580
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:11,712
No!

581
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,591
Mommy!

582
00:43:19,998 --> 00:43:22,728
Did the hospital
let you out early?

583
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:25,293
Give your mother a kiss.

584
00:43:25,671 --> 00:43:27,298
What are you doing here?

585
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,308
Well, I was thinking,

586
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:31,535
ice cream.

587
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,009
Yeah, yeah!

588
00:43:33,078 --> 00:43:35,774
I have baseball practice.

589
00:43:35,847 --> 00:43:37,337
- Well, you can miss one practice.
- No!

590
00:43:37,416 --> 00:43:39,043
I can't miss a practice!

591
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,641
Okay, honey.

592
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:42,277
Okay.

593
00:43:42,354 --> 00:43:45,790
Did you do something wrong
at work?

594
00:43:45,857 --> 00:43:47,882
I hate ice cream!

595
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,187
Chick!

596
00:43:49,394 --> 00:43:51,988
It's okay, honey.

597
00:43:53,031 --> 00:43:55,522
Some doctor couldn't
keep his hands to himself,

598
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,296
my mother had the guts
to speak up,

599
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:00,304
and they let her go.

600
00:44:00,706 --> 00:44:01,764
But...

601
00:44:02,808 --> 00:44:04,435
why didn't she file a complaint?

602
00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:06,409
It was a different time.

603
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:08,446
She tried to keep us the same,
but back then,

604
00:44:08,513 --> 00:44:10,242
a small town doesn't
let you be the same

605
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:12,943
if there was a divorce.

606
00:44:24,229 --> 00:44:26,493
Would you turn that off, young man?

607
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:31,865
Sometimes I have it on too loud.

608
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:36,001
I only listen for the news.

609
00:44:37,042 --> 00:44:40,671
Oh, did you hear about
that terrible accident?

610
00:44:40,746 --> 00:44:44,682
A car veered
into the wrong lane,

611
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,411
almost hit a truck,

612
00:44:46,485 --> 00:44:49,010
and crashed into the ravine.

613
00:44:49,087 --> 00:44:50,611
Terrible!

614
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:53,715
Yeah, the news can be
depressing sometimes, Rose.

615
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:56,784
Oh, yes, so much so.

616
00:44:59,965 --> 00:45:02,957
What's the matter?

617
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:06,903
It's nice you spend
the day with your mother.

618
00:45:06,972 --> 00:45:09,566
Children should do that more often.

619
00:45:09,641 --> 00:45:12,132
Yeah, Charley's a good boy.

620
00:45:16,148 --> 00:45:19,515
Are you all right?

621
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:22,918
Why don't you answer the phone?

622
00:45:29,528 --> 00:45:30,790
Hello?

623
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:34,765
Mr. Benetto,
Charles Benetto.

624
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:37,734
I need you to talk to me.

625
00:45:37,803 --> 00:45:39,998
Come on, Charles,
I know you can hear me.

626
00:45:41,106 --> 00:45:43,370
Who was on the phone?

627
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:46,741
No one.

628
00:45:50,515 --> 00:45:53,575
Oh, no.
Charley, Charley.

629
00:45:54,619 --> 00:45:57,611
Where's that ever gotten you?

630
00:45:57,889 --> 00:46:00,881
Now's a time you have to remember.

631
00:46:08,033 --> 00:46:09,466
Look at me.

632
00:46:10,502 --> 00:46:12,060
Look at me.

633
00:46:13,905 --> 00:46:15,839
Do you trust me?

634
00:46:18,477 --> 00:46:19,705
Do you?

635
00:46:22,681 --> 00:46:23,909
Good!

636
00:46:41,566 --> 00:46:43,591
So long, Rose.

637
00:46:44,636 --> 00:46:47,434
I'll see you soon, dear, won't I?

638
00:46:47,506 --> 00:46:49,235
Yes, you will.

639
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:51,639
Good luck, Charley.

640
00:46:52,644 --> 00:46:54,509
You look nice.

641
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:56,979
It's a special day.

642
00:46:57,048 --> 00:46:59,039
What's the occasion?

643
00:46:59,117 --> 00:47:02,109
I'm going to see my husband.

644
00:47:05,023 --> 00:47:07,014
Bye.

645
00:47:20,805 --> 00:47:22,602
She's dying, you know.

646
00:47:23,642 --> 00:47:26,008
Rose?

647
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:28,705
She'll die tonight.

648
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,042
I don't get it.

649
00:47:30,115 --> 00:47:32,549
She said she was going
to visit her husband.

650
00:47:32,617 --> 00:47:34,949
She is.

651
00:47:36,488 --> 00:47:39,980
Mom, how do you know this?

652
00:47:41,026 --> 00:47:43,153
She called me.

653
00:47:43,228 --> 00:47:46,220
I've been helping her
get ready.

654
00:48:10,488 --> 00:48:11,853
Enough baseball, Charley.

655
00:48:12,891 --> 00:48:15,257
Come inside
and do your homework.

656
00:48:15,327 --> 00:48:17,625
Is he ever coming home?

657
00:48:18,763 --> 00:48:20,196
Is he?

658
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:23,223
No.

659
00:48:23,868 --> 00:48:25,859
What did you do?

660
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:28,065
What?

661
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:30,039
You made him leave.

662
00:48:30,108 --> 00:48:31,234
Charley.

663
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:32,469
You did something to him.

664
00:48:32,544 --> 00:48:33,476
What did you do?

665
00:48:33,511 --> 00:48:35,536
Don't talk to me like that.

666
00:48:35,647 --> 00:48:37,205
Tell me!

667
00:48:37,282 --> 00:48:38,544
You're too young.

668
00:48:38,617 --> 00:48:40,847
It's too hard for you
to understand.

669
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,883
Never tell a child
something is too hard!

670
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:46,390
- Get in the house.
- No.

671
00:48:46,458 --> 00:48:48,756
Charley, I said get in the house!

672
00:48:48,827 --> 00:48:51,625
Charley, you get back here.
Charley!

673
00:49:35,674 --> 00:49:37,938
There you go.

674
00:49:41,613 --> 00:49:42,875
You cut the crusts off.

675
00:49:43,915 --> 00:49:46,179
That's the way
you always liked it.

676
00:49:46,251 --> 00:49:48,719
I'm not a kid anymore.

677
00:49:48,787 --> 00:49:51,449
Of course you're not.

678
00:49:53,124 --> 00:49:56,321
You haven't mentioned
Catherine or Maria.

679
00:49:57,362 --> 00:49:59,353
How are they?

680
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:04,158
She's fine.
They're fine.

681
00:50:08,807 --> 00:50:10,798
No, they're...

682
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:15,643
Catherine and I aren't
together anymore.

683
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:18,740
And Maria doesn't...

684
00:50:18,817 --> 00:50:23,049
She...

685
00:50:23,121 --> 00:50:26,022
She doesn't speak to me.

686
00:50:26,091 --> 00:50:28,491
She's ashamed of me.

687
00:50:29,761 --> 00:50:32,423
Are you listening?

688
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:40,003
Sometimes,
children want you to hurt

689
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:43,599
the way they do.

690
00:50:43,675 --> 00:50:47,304
Maria is not a child, Ma.

691
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:50,575
Do you know
how old she is now?

692
00:50:50,648 --> 00:50:51,842
Do you?

693
00:50:51,916 --> 00:50:53,941
Come on, Ma.

694
00:50:54,018 --> 00:50:56,680
Things can be fixed,
you know.

695
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:11,430
How come they didn't
invite you to their party?

696
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:14,665
We're having
our own party right here.

697
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:17,264
Santa's coming.

698
00:51:17,342 --> 00:51:18,934
And he may come by 10:00,

699
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:20,136
which means you, young lady,

700
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:22,202
had better be sound asleep by then.

701
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,475
10:00?

702
00:51:51,176 --> 00:51:52,541
Is that Santa?

703
00:51:53,578 --> 00:51:56,012
Ho, ho, ho!
Who's there?

704
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,105
No, you'll scare him away!

705
00:51:58,183 --> 00:52:00,014
It's just Mom, stupid.

706
00:52:00,084 --> 00:52:02,075
Stop it, it's Santa!

707
00:52:02,153 --> 00:52:03,848
Santa's not a girl, stupid.

708
00:52:03,922 --> 00:52:05,947
It's Mom.
It's always Mom.

709
00:52:06,024 --> 00:52:09,187
- Stop it!
- It's always gonna be Mom.

710
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,636
Answer the door.

711
00:52:29,948 --> 00:52:31,279
Answer the door, Charley.

712
00:52:32,317 --> 00:52:34,785
Just leave it.

713
00:52:34,853 --> 00:52:37,185
Maybe they'll go away.

714
00:52:37,455 --> 00:52:39,150
No, they won't.

715
00:52:59,544 --> 00:53:01,341
Charles Benetto.

716
00:53:09,888 --> 00:53:12,482
Chickadoo?

717
00:53:16,461 --> 00:53:19,453
Well, look who's all grown up.

718
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,532
I'm the only one
wearing a stupid tie.

719
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:28,130
It's your first day of college.

720
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:30,265
You're not going fishing.

721
00:53:30,341 --> 00:53:33,208
Did we remember
your toiletry kit?

722
00:53:34,379 --> 00:53:36,279
Did you pack it?

723
00:53:37,315 --> 00:53:38,976
Yeah, I packed it.

724
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:46,886
Okay, third floor.

725
00:53:47,926 --> 00:53:49,291
I can take those.

726
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,590
Oh, please.

727
00:53:51,663 --> 00:53:53,631
I want to see your room.

728
00:53:53,698 --> 00:53:55,165
Oh, come on, Ma.

729
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:56,825
I can make up your bed.

730
00:53:57,835 --> 00:53:58,995
Okay.

731
00:54:00,038 --> 00:54:03,030
You can probably
make up your own bed.

732
00:54:07,612 --> 00:54:10,080
Okay, well, this is it.

733
00:54:11,115 --> 00:54:13,379
Give your mother a kiss.

734
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:29,096
Study.

735
00:54:31,002 --> 00:54:32,367
Bye, Mom.

736
00:54:36,474 --> 00:54:39,102
Stopped up across the floor!

737
00:54:40,144 --> 00:54:42,009
I wanted to kill him!

738
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,581
I've been thinking of you, Posey.

739
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:48,983
- Have you?
- I surely have.

740
00:54:49,053 --> 00:54:51,521
Didn't expect to see you here,
Chickadoo.

741
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:53,181
What's the occasion?

742
00:54:53,257 --> 00:54:55,521
I'm visiting my mom.

743
00:54:55,593 --> 00:54:57,493
Will wonders never cease?

744
00:54:57,562 --> 00:54:58,688
Grandma!

745
00:55:13,711 --> 00:55:15,611
What just happened?

746
00:55:25,156 --> 00:55:26,316
I hate that my family

747
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:30,452
sees me so sick and ugly.

748
00:55:30,528 --> 00:55:32,257
Grandma, come play with us.

749
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:34,025
Could you, Posey?

750
00:55:34,098 --> 00:55:35,622
Of course I can.

751
00:55:36,334 --> 00:55:38,734
It may take a miracle.

752
00:55:39,771 --> 00:55:41,739
I've got moisturizer.

753
00:55:41,806 --> 00:55:44,798
Do you believe in miracles,
Chickadoo?

754
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:01,415
Two outs, guys.
Two outs.

755
00:56:04,195 --> 00:56:06,322
Bring us home, Chicky!

756
00:56:07,365 --> 00:56:09,925
Chick, let's go.
Win, win, win!

757
00:56:10,001 --> 00:56:11,298
We got 'em!

758
00:56:12,303 --> 00:56:15,295
Wait for it, Chick.
Wait for it.

759
00:56:15,973 --> 00:56:18,840
Make it count.

760
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:21,401
Strike!

761
00:56:21,479 --> 00:56:22,969
Chick, you can do it!

762
00:56:23,047 --> 00:56:24,139
It's all right, man!

763
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:29,283
Hang in there, Chick.
Stay there.

764
00:56:30,321 --> 00:56:32,118
- Stay in there, Chicky!
- Show 'em, Chick!

765
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:33,316
All right, Chick.

766
00:56:33,391 --> 00:56:34,756
Here's your pitch, Chick!
Come on, man.

767
00:56:34,826 --> 00:56:36,191
- We need a hit!
- Yeah, Chick!

768
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:38,387
- Here we go, come on!
- Chicky!

769
00:56:38,463 --> 00:56:40,226
Let's go, Chick.

770
00:56:40,698 --> 00:56:42,563
Here you go, Chick!

771
00:56:56,114 --> 00:56:57,479
Way to go, Chick!

772
00:56:58,516 --> 00:57:00,006
Great hit!

773
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:02,583
Good job, Chicky!

774
00:57:08,359 --> 00:57:10,190
Way to go, kid.

775
00:57:27,078 --> 00:57:28,204
All that time,

776
00:57:29,247 --> 00:57:32,273
she never told you why he left?

777
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:35,979
After a while,
you just stop asking.

778
00:57:36,053 --> 00:57:38,317
Why do you think
people keep secrets

779
00:57:38,389 --> 00:57:41,324
from their family, I mean?

780
00:57:41,392 --> 00:57:44,384
Can there ever be
a good enough reason?

781
00:57:44,462 --> 00:57:46,020
I don't know.

782
00:57:47,064 --> 00:57:49,362
You tell me.

783
00:57:50,368 --> 00:57:55,806
Way to hit it
out of the park, Chick!

784
00:57:58,142 --> 00:57:59,837
Nice hit, Chick!

785
00:58:01,045 --> 00:58:03,070
Good game.

786
00:58:04,115 --> 00:58:06,015
Thanks.

787
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:07,414
Nice follow-through,

788
00:58:07,485 --> 00:58:08,952
staying behind the ball.

789
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:11,284
It makes the ball carry.

790
00:58:13,925 --> 00:58:15,290
What?

791
00:58:16,327 --> 00:58:18,022
You want to hit me?

792
00:58:18,095 --> 00:58:20,086
No.

793
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,031
Tell your coach

794
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:26,366
I'll drive you back to campus.

795
00:58:35,279 --> 00:58:38,214
I didn't hate baseball.

796
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:40,376
Of course you did.

797
00:58:40,451 --> 00:58:41,577
I did not.

798
00:58:41,652 --> 00:58:43,313
You didn't even come to the Series.

799
00:58:43,387 --> 00:58:44,547
Well...

800
00:58:44,622 --> 00:58:46,089
You got two tickets.

801
00:58:46,157 --> 00:58:48,318
You knew your father
wasn't going to miss it.

802
00:58:48,392 --> 00:58:49,552
What, you were expecting

803
00:58:49,627 --> 00:58:51,185
a family reunion?

804
00:58:51,262 --> 00:58:52,593
Do you two want to be alone?

805
00:58:52,663 --> 00:58:53,994
Now, just hold still, Thelma.

806
00:58:54,065 --> 00:58:55,225
But I loved it, Ma.

807
00:58:55,299 --> 00:58:56,425
Forget about Dad
for a minute,

808
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,660
I loved the game.

809
00:58:57,735 --> 00:58:59,703
- I was good at it.
- I know you were.

810
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:01,704
So why couldn't you support me?

811
00:59:01,772 --> 00:59:04,570
I did support you!

812
00:59:04,642 --> 00:59:06,109
At school.

813
00:59:06,177 --> 00:59:08,577
At studying, yes,
but not at baseball,

814
00:59:08,646 --> 00:59:10,273
not at what I wanted.

815
00:59:10,348 --> 00:59:12,475
Why?

816
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:14,415
Just tell me why.

817
00:59:14,485 --> 00:59:17,352
Because I knew it would
break your heart.

818
00:59:20,258 --> 00:59:21,384
Swing!

819
00:59:22,426 --> 00:59:23,620
- Nice hit, Chick!
- Let's go!

820
00:59:23,694 --> 00:59:25,787
Hit it hard, now!

821
00:59:29,867 --> 00:59:32,927
Can't get that one out.

822
00:59:33,971 --> 00:59:35,495
Get another one!

823
00:59:36,741 --> 00:59:40,177
- Way to go.
- Nice, Chick.

824
00:59:41,212 --> 00:59:43,612
You're next in there.

825
00:59:43,681 --> 00:59:45,672
Hey.

826
00:59:46,717 --> 00:59:48,514
Say hello to Wally Peters.

827
00:59:50,488 --> 00:59:52,183
You got a hell of a swing.

828
00:59:53,224 --> 00:59:55,021
Outstanding contact,

829
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:57,925
opposite field power.

830
00:59:57,995 --> 01:00:00,190
Your old man taught you good.

831
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:02,357
Thanks.

832
01:00:02,433 --> 01:00:03,900
Keep it up, kid.

833
01:00:03,968 --> 01:00:05,196
- Take care, Len.
- Yeah.

834
01:00:06,237 --> 01:00:07,829
- I'll send you some gear.
- Sounds good.

835
01:00:07,905 --> 01:00:10,237
Hey, Jimmy!

836
01:00:10,308 --> 01:00:13,141
You want some gear?

837
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:15,701
From the New York Mets?

838
01:00:16,213 --> 01:00:17,339
You're kidding.

839
01:00:18,382 --> 01:00:20,714
He's a scout?

840
01:00:23,721 --> 01:00:26,087
You have time for a beer?

841
01:00:28,726 --> 01:00:30,091
See, hard work pays off.

842
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:32,561
Didn't I tell you that?

843
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:33,756
This is your time, son.

844
01:00:33,831 --> 01:00:35,355
This is your time.

845
01:00:35,433 --> 01:00:36,866
You just stay
in those cages.

846
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:38,299
You put in the hours,

847
01:00:38,369 --> 01:00:39,836
and I will do the rest.

848
01:00:41,572 --> 01:00:42,834
What about school?

849
01:00:43,874 --> 01:00:46,843
You're too good
for college ball.

850
01:00:46,911 --> 01:00:48,902
No, Dad.

851
01:00:49,113 --> 01:00:51,343
I mean, school.

852
01:00:52,383 --> 01:00:54,010
You can always go back

853
01:00:54,085 --> 01:00:56,246
after your career.

854
01:00:57,421 --> 01:00:58,513
No.

855
01:00:59,557 --> 01:01:00,990
Excuse me?

856
01:01:01,058 --> 01:01:03,117
I can't.

857
01:01:03,194 --> 01:01:04,593
Mom will kill me.

858
01:01:04,662 --> 01:01:06,254
You listen to me, Chick.

859
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:07,524
She has a hard head,

860
01:01:07,598 --> 01:01:09,190
- but she will get over it.
- Dad, please...

861
01:01:09,266 --> 01:01:10,324
No, no, no.
You tell me

862
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:11,595
if you don't want to play

863
01:01:11,669 --> 01:01:13,603
Major League Baseball.

864
01:01:13,671 --> 01:01:16,663
You do that,
and I don't say another word.

865
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:21,810
Remember,
this is your dream.

866
01:01:22,847 --> 01:01:24,678
Your mother has
to understand that.

867
01:01:24,749 --> 01:01:27,741
This is your dream.

868
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:37,026
Hello, Ida's Beauty Shop.

869
01:01:38,062 --> 01:01:40,622
Collect call for Mrs. Benetto.

870
01:01:40,698 --> 01:01:42,290
It is your son,
do you accept?

871
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:44,561
- Yes, I accept. Charley?
- Mom.

872
01:01:44,635 --> 01:01:46,432
- Mom, don't get mad.
- Where are you?

873
01:01:46,504 --> 01:01:48,062
I'm with a baseball team.

874
01:01:48,139 --> 01:01:49,470
The Mets farm system.

875
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:50,734
It happened really fast,

876
01:01:50,808 --> 01:01:53,106
but they're paying me, Mom,
to play ball.

877
01:01:53,177 --> 01:01:55,077
Why aren't you at school?

878
01:01:55,146 --> 01:01:57,808
I'm not in school anymore.

879
01:01:57,882 --> 01:02:00,646
Mom, Dad's been coming
to my games.

880
01:02:00,718 --> 01:02:02,743
I didn't know how to tell you.

881
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:04,617
- But he talked to the scouts.
- Hey, 4:00.

882
01:02:04,688 --> 01:02:05,985
He got me a contract.

883
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:08,081
I'm playing professional ball, Ma.

884
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:10,753
I can send money to you now.

885
01:02:10,828 --> 01:02:12,125
I don't want your money.

886
01:02:12,196 --> 01:02:13,686
I want you in school.

887
01:02:13,764 --> 01:02:14,924
But I wasn't getting any better

888
01:02:14,999 --> 01:02:15,966
playing in college.

889
01:02:16,033 --> 01:02:18,160
You were getting smarter.

890
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:19,793
I can always
go back to school.

891
01:02:20,271 --> 01:02:22,899
Going back to something
is harder than you think.

892
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:25,636
I want to play baseball.

893
01:02:25,709 --> 01:02:27,643
Mom?

894
01:02:34,585 --> 01:02:37,577
I couldn't have hurt her
more if I tried.

895
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:50,358
But you were good at it.

896
01:02:51,402 --> 01:02:52,767
I mean, you made the majors,

897
01:02:52,837 --> 01:02:54,737
a World Series!

898
01:02:54,805 --> 01:02:56,636
I got called up in September

899
01:02:56,707 --> 01:02:58,800
to replace a guy who got hurt.

900
01:02:58,876 --> 01:03:00,810
The team was great
before I got there.

901
01:03:00,878 --> 01:03:02,470
I just went along for the ride.

902
01:03:02,546 --> 01:03:04,673
But still.

903
01:03:04,748 --> 01:03:06,010
I know.

904
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:08,244
World Series.

905
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:11,413
It never leaves your head.

906
01:03:24,368 --> 01:03:27,132
I felt more alive
those couple of weeks

907
01:03:28,172 --> 01:03:31,573
than I have the rest of my life.

908
01:03:32,977 --> 01:03:35,468
Here come the greatest
players in history,

909
01:03:36,514 --> 01:03:39,347
the New York Mets!

910
01:03:44,021 --> 01:03:45,113
Ladies and gentlemen,

911
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:48,818
your 1973
National League Champions,

912
01:03:48,893 --> 01:03:50,155
New York Mets!

913
01:03:50,227 --> 01:03:52,627
We lost the Series,

914
01:03:52,696 --> 01:03:55,221
and I never even got to bat.

915
01:03:55,299 --> 01:03:56,527
It didn't matter.

916
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,933
I thought there'd be
a World Series every year

917
01:04:00,004 --> 01:04:02,905
until the next spring.

918
01:04:04,775 --> 01:04:07,767
March eighth, fifth inning.

919
01:04:27,097 --> 01:04:28,962
I never saw the majors again.

920
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,059
Two surgeries,

921
01:04:32,136 --> 01:04:34,331
three months on crutches,

922
01:04:34,405 --> 01:04:36,703
an exhibition game.

923
01:04:36,774 --> 01:04:37,934
Didn't even count.

924
01:04:48,285 --> 01:04:50,879
Still, your dream came true.

925
01:04:51,922 --> 01:04:53,082
Then that just means

926
01:04:53,157 --> 01:04:55,523
you have to change dreams.

927
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:59,058
I stayed in the minors for years

928
01:05:00,097 --> 01:05:03,089
trying to get back to a place
I'd already been.

929
01:05:06,136 --> 01:05:07,933
And your father?

930
01:05:08,973 --> 01:05:11,874
When I finally quit,
he pretty much vanished.

931
01:05:11,942 --> 01:05:13,705
Bought a liquor distributorship

932
01:05:13,777 --> 01:05:15,836
near Pittsburgh.

933
01:05:15,913 --> 01:05:17,710
He didn't even offer you a job?

934
01:05:19,183 --> 01:05:21,947
No sympathy for losers.

935
01:05:46,477 --> 01:05:49,378
I miss those Saturdays
working with you.

936
01:05:50,414 --> 01:05:52,075
We sure had fun.

937
01:05:52,149 --> 01:05:54,811
Oh, we certainly did that.

938
01:05:54,885 --> 01:05:56,682
You worked
at the beauty parlor?

939
01:05:56,754 --> 01:05:58,483
Me?

940
01:05:59,423 --> 01:06:02,392
No, we cleaned houses together.

941
01:06:03,427 --> 01:06:05,952
How do you think I got
you kids through college?

942
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:07,327
You were a cleaning lady?

943
01:06:08,666 --> 01:06:10,691
You mean,
you mopped people's floors?

944
01:06:11,735 --> 01:06:12,929
Yes, Charley.

945
01:06:13,003 --> 01:06:14,402
He was always a little proud.

946
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:18,407
- I remember.
- I was not.

947
01:06:18,575 --> 01:06:19,872
It's just, I know what it's like

948
01:06:20,911 --> 01:06:23,277
to take a job
that's beneath you.

949
01:06:23,347 --> 01:06:24,871
It wasn't beneath me.

950
01:06:24,948 --> 01:06:25,972
It was.

951
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:27,642
Just like my job.

952
01:06:27,718 --> 01:06:29,982
What's wrong with what you do?

953
01:06:30,054 --> 01:06:31,612
It's sales.

954
01:06:32,423 --> 01:06:33,754
What?

955
01:06:34,792 --> 01:06:36,316
It's work?

956
01:06:36,393 --> 01:06:39,385
What, Charley?

957
01:06:39,463 --> 01:06:41,260
It's ordinary.

958
01:06:43,067 --> 01:06:44,932
Define ordinary.

959
01:06:45,969 --> 01:06:48,062
You know.

960
01:06:48,305 --> 01:06:51,138
Someone you forget.

961
01:06:52,176 --> 01:06:54,576
Grandma!

962
01:06:54,645 --> 01:06:56,306
You hear that?

963
01:06:56,380 --> 01:07:00,043
That's what keeps me
from being forgot.

964
01:07:00,117 --> 01:07:02,108
You do whatever
you have to do

965
01:07:02,186 --> 01:07:04,279
to hold your family together.

966
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:07,289
And there is nothing
ordinary about it.

967
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:09,450
But you didn't do
what you wanted to.

968
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:11,118
Oh, I did what I wanted to.

969
01:07:11,195 --> 01:07:12,822
I was a mother.

970
01:07:22,773 --> 01:07:25,241
A miracle.

971
01:07:26,276 --> 01:07:28,972
We're waiting for you!

972
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:32,813
I'm going to go visit
with them a spell.

973
01:07:32,883 --> 01:07:34,851
I'll see you soon.

974
01:07:54,538 --> 01:07:58,030
Would you please tell me
what's happening?

975
01:07:59,076 --> 01:08:01,567
She was thinking of me.

976
01:08:01,645 --> 01:08:03,442
When you hold someone
in your thoughts,

977
01:08:03,514 --> 01:08:05,744
they're always around.

978
01:08:05,816 --> 01:08:07,977
Wait.

979
01:08:09,019 --> 01:08:11,010
She said she'd see you.

980
01:08:12,156 --> 01:08:14,090
She's dying?

981
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:16,786
Soon.

982
01:08:18,262 --> 01:08:20,856
Like Rose.

983
01:08:21,899 --> 01:08:24,732
Like Rose.

984
01:08:24,802 --> 01:08:28,101
And I'm dying too.

985
01:08:28,172 --> 01:08:30,572
Am I dying, Ma?

986
01:08:32,509 --> 01:08:36,138
I didn't do what you did.

987
01:08:37,181 --> 01:08:39,172
I didn't keep my family together.

988
01:08:39,249 --> 01:08:41,308
I let it go.
I just... I just...

989
01:08:41,385 --> 01:08:42,511
Charles Benetto?

990
01:08:42,586 --> 01:08:44,281
Are you Charles Benetto?

991
01:08:44,354 --> 01:08:45,981
Charles, are you with us?

992
01:08:47,591 --> 01:08:48,990
What do I do?

993
01:08:50,027 --> 01:08:52,860
It's up to you, Charley.

994
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:55,023
Mr. Benetto, are you with us?

995
01:08:55,098 --> 01:08:56,395
Mr. Benetto.

996
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:57,626
- Mr. Benetto.
- Talk to me.

997
01:08:57,701 --> 01:09:00,670
- Come on, can you hear me?
- Charles Benetto.

998
01:09:13,817 --> 01:09:18,481
I always said I'd stop celebrating
my birthdays after age 70.

999
01:09:20,224 --> 01:09:22,488
You said you were here.

1000
01:09:23,527 --> 01:09:24,926
You said, "This is real."

1001
01:09:24,995 --> 01:09:26,155
- It is.
- No, it isn't.

1002
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:28,061
You're gone.

1003
01:09:28,131 --> 01:09:30,599
Well, once somebody's
in your heart,

1004
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:33,261
they're never truly gone.

1005
01:09:33,337 --> 01:09:34,929
And they can come back to you

1006
01:09:35,005 --> 01:09:37,803
in the most unlikely times.

1007
01:09:37,875 --> 01:09:38,933
I let you die.

1008
01:09:39,009 --> 01:09:40,943
Well, you had nothing
to do with it.

1009
01:09:41,011 --> 01:09:42,171
But I should have been there.

1010
01:09:42,246 --> 01:09:43,406
Maybe I could have...

1011
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:44,447
You could have what?

1012
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:47,847
Saved me? Charley.

1013
01:09:47,918 --> 01:09:50,751
You know, you drink,
you hide,

1014
01:09:50,821 --> 01:09:53,346
you point your finger
at everyone else.

1015
01:09:53,423 --> 01:09:55,288
The one thing that
you had absolutely

1016
01:09:55,359 --> 01:09:57,224
no control over whatsoever,

1017
01:09:57,294 --> 01:10:00,195
that, you want
to blame yourself for.

1018
01:10:00,264 --> 01:10:02,129
No.

1019
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:04,394
Why don't you ask yourself,

1020
01:10:04,468 --> 01:10:06,333
what's behind all of this?

1021
01:10:06,403 --> 01:10:09,065
I don't know.

1022
01:10:09,139 --> 01:10:11,232
I'm starting to count
my birthdays backwards now.

1023
01:10:11,308 --> 01:10:13,572
I'm getting younger every year.

1024
01:10:13,644 --> 01:10:14,633
Let's see.

1025
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:16,645
"Birthdays come
but once a year,

1026
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:20,012
a chance to share
with friends so dear."

1027
01:10:21,351 --> 01:10:23,251
What, is she going
to read every card?

1028
01:10:24,288 --> 01:10:25,755
Oh, shut up, Chick,
it's sweet.

1029
01:10:25,822 --> 01:10:26,880
Uh, let's see.

1030
01:10:26,957 --> 01:10:28,015
"Friends tomorrow,

1031
01:10:28,091 --> 01:10:29,285
"friends today.

1032
01:10:29,359 --> 01:10:31,589
Friends for every
new birthday."

1033
01:10:31,929 --> 01:10:33,692
Actually, I think this is
the same card

1034
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:36,494
I gave you for your birthday.

1035
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:39,865
No, no, no,
I'm kidding!

1036
01:10:39,937 --> 01:10:42,235
Thank you,
it's beautiful.

1037
01:10:42,306 --> 01:10:43,898
Let's see.

1038
01:10:46,276 --> 01:10:47,573
Hello?

1039
01:10:49,947 --> 01:10:51,915
Chick, that you?

1040
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:54,110
Dad?

1041
01:10:54,184 --> 01:10:55,412
I tried your office,

1042
01:10:55,485 --> 01:10:56,509
I tried your house.

1043
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:58,554
I couldn't figure
where the hell you were.

1044
01:10:58,622 --> 01:11:00,556
I'm at Mom's birthday party.

1045
01:11:00,624 --> 01:11:03,616
Listen. The Mets have
their old-timers game, right?

1046
01:11:03,694 --> 01:11:05,491
I was talking to Harrelson.

1047
01:11:05,562 --> 01:11:07,223
He told me Fitzgerald
crapped out.

1048
01:11:07,297 --> 01:11:09,492
- He ain't coming.
- So?

1049
01:11:09,566 --> 01:11:11,295
So, it's too late
to get a replacement.

1050
01:11:11,368 --> 01:11:13,165
I told him
you were around.

1051
01:11:13,236 --> 01:11:15,295
I'm not around.

1052
01:11:15,372 --> 01:11:16,703
You can be.

1053
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:20,607
You leave now,
you can be here by late tonight.

1054
01:11:20,677 --> 01:11:22,770
They want me to play
in the old-timers game?

1055
01:11:22,846 --> 01:11:24,404
That's what I'm saying.

1056
01:11:24,481 --> 01:11:25,880
But I only played a month.

1057
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:27,439
That don't mean nothing.

1058
01:11:27,517 --> 01:11:28,848
You were on
the World Series team.

1059
01:11:28,919 --> 01:11:30,250
They'll take you.

1060
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:33,380
Now, look, you got just
enough time to get going.

1061
01:11:33,457 --> 01:11:34,856
I don't know.

1062
01:11:34,925 --> 01:11:36,187
Don't know what?

1063
01:11:36,259 --> 01:11:37,726
It's not about the game, Chick.

1064
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:39,193
It's about the connections
you can make.

1065
01:11:39,262 --> 01:11:40,786
You get in there,
you throw the bull.

1066
01:11:40,864 --> 01:11:42,593
See if there's
a coaching spot opening up.

1067
01:11:42,666 --> 01:11:45,134
Maybe something
in the minors.

1068
01:11:45,202 --> 01:11:46,601
You tell them
you'll move anywhere,

1069
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:47,796
you'll start anywhere.

1070
01:11:47,871 --> 01:11:48,838
Get back in the game.

1071
01:11:48,905 --> 01:11:50,873
Dad, I have a job.

1072
01:11:50,941 --> 01:11:52,033
Oh, yeah?

1073
01:11:52,109 --> 01:11:54,304
What are you selling now?

1074
01:11:56,913 --> 01:11:58,574
When is it?

1075
01:11:59,616 --> 01:12:01,447
Noon, tomorrow.

1076
01:12:02,285 --> 01:12:04,583
It's Mom's birthday.

1077
01:12:05,622 --> 01:12:08,523
Well, tomorrow it ain't.

1078
01:12:12,129 --> 01:12:13,255
What kind of client

1079
01:12:14,297 --> 01:12:16,231
makes you meet on Sunday?

1080
01:12:16,299 --> 01:12:17,561
I know, I know.

1081
01:12:17,634 --> 01:12:18,726
It's ridiculous.

1082
01:12:18,802 --> 01:12:21,202
I thought we were going
to spend the day together.

1083
01:12:21,271 --> 01:12:22,533
It's my job, Ma.

1084
01:12:22,606 --> 01:12:23,868
What do you want me to do?

1085
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,567
Well, you could call him back

1086
01:12:25,642 --> 01:12:27,132
and tell him it's
your mother's birthday.

1087
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:29,007
I can't call him back, okay?

1088
01:12:29,079 --> 01:12:30,410
Chick.

1089
01:12:34,785 --> 01:12:37,413
Look, I'll be back.

1090
01:12:38,455 --> 01:12:40,446
We'll go out someplace nice.

1091
01:12:40,524 --> 01:12:42,116
What do you say?

1092
01:12:42,192 --> 01:12:44,752
You do what you have to do, Charley.

1093
01:12:44,828 --> 01:12:46,728
Thanks, Mom.

1094
01:12:46,797 --> 01:12:49,459
And take some cake.

1095
01:12:49,533 --> 01:12:51,626
I'll call you, okay?

1096
01:12:52,636 --> 01:12:53,967
See you tomorrow.

1097
01:12:54,504 --> 01:12:57,166
Be careful, Charley.

1098
01:13:31,675 --> 01:13:34,508
Run those wheels!

1099
01:13:35,545 --> 01:13:37,445
Nobody out.

1100
01:13:38,448 --> 01:13:41,008
Next batter,

1101
01:13:42,052 --> 01:13:45,783
from the World Series team of 1973,

1102
01:13:45,856 --> 01:13:49,622
Charles "Chick" Benetto.

1103
01:13:51,328 --> 01:13:53,319
Come on, boy.

1104
01:13:54,364 --> 01:13:56,127
Let's get a hit, baby!

1105
01:13:56,199 --> 01:13:57,496
Give it all you got, yeah!

1106
01:13:57,567 --> 01:13:58,693
Come on, Chick!

1107
01:13:58,768 --> 01:14:01,134
Brought in from Tidewater
in late September,

1108
01:14:01,204 --> 01:14:03,138
this promising young catcher

1109
01:14:03,206 --> 01:14:05,197
would add invaluable
bench support

1110
01:14:05,275 --> 01:14:07,243
at a time the team
needed it most.

1111
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:10,336
- One for me, Chick!
- Let's see one of those meatballs!

1112
01:14:10,413 --> 01:14:14,008
Let's see what you got.

1113
01:14:14,084 --> 01:14:17,713
Come on! Come on!

1114
01:14:22,759 --> 01:14:24,784
Nice try.

1115
01:14:25,829 --> 01:14:27,820
Easy, guy.
It's not worth dying over.

1116
01:14:27,898 --> 01:14:29,490
Next time.

1117
01:14:29,566 --> 01:14:31,864
Remember, fans.
Mets-Cubs coming up.

1118
01:14:31,935 --> 01:14:35,701
2:30 start time.
Ramone Santiago versus...

1119
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,797
Hey.

1120
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:08,235
You got under that pitch.

1121
01:15:08,305 --> 01:15:09,897
Yeah.

1122
01:15:09,973 --> 01:15:11,201
Don't matter.
You're rusty.

1123
01:15:11,274 --> 01:15:14,437
What did you expect?

1124
01:15:14,511 --> 01:15:16,741
How come you're
out here so fast?

1125
01:15:16,813 --> 01:15:18,610
Game's over, Dad.

1126
01:15:18,682 --> 01:15:21,446
Did you talk to Harrelson?

1127
01:15:22,319 --> 01:15:23,980
Did you at least
leave your number?

1128
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:26,181
How they gonna call you

1129
01:15:26,256 --> 01:15:28,588
if you don't leave your numbers?

1130
01:15:28,658 --> 01:15:29,955
Get back in there.

1131
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:31,653
Dad.

1132
01:15:31,728 --> 01:15:33,195
Come on,
before they all leave.

1133
01:15:33,263 --> 01:15:36,061
Dad, I haven't seen you in years.

1134
01:15:36,132 --> 01:15:37,292
So what?

1135
01:15:37,367 --> 01:15:38,561
Damn it, Chick.

1136
01:15:38,635 --> 01:15:40,193
How you gonna
get back in the game

1137
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:42,135
talking to me?

1138
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:43,467
I got to go.

1139
01:15:44,474 --> 01:15:45,634
What are you talking about?

1140
01:15:45,709 --> 01:15:46,733
I'll see you around.

1141
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:48,744
Where are you going?

1142
01:16:44,868 --> 01:16:47,860
I wanted that day back
so many times.

1143
01:16:52,175 --> 01:16:56,236
The last thing
I told you was a lie.

1144
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,510
It wasn't work.

1145
01:16:59,582 --> 01:17:01,812
It was...

1146
01:17:01,885 --> 01:17:03,477
Your father.

1147
01:17:04,487 --> 01:17:07,945
- You knew?
- Well, of course I knew.

1148
01:17:08,024 --> 01:17:09,286
I spent my life

1149
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:11,327
watching your face light up

1150
01:17:11,394 --> 01:17:12,383
every time he gave you

1151
01:17:12,462 --> 01:17:15,454
the tiniest bit of attention.

1152
01:17:16,833 --> 01:17:19,597
When I found out you died,

1153
01:17:20,637 --> 01:17:22,070
the first thing I thought was,

1154
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:23,833
"I have to call Dad."

1155
01:17:23,907 --> 01:17:27,604
Can you believe that?

1156
01:17:27,677 --> 01:17:30,475
I never saw him again.

1157
01:17:30,547 --> 01:17:32,538
I lost both of my parents that day.

1158
01:17:32,615 --> 01:17:36,244
I let him down,
I let you down...

1159
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:39,686
Is that why you want to die?

1160
01:17:40,557 --> 01:17:43,117
I lost everything.

1161
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:45,684
I lost you,

1162
01:17:45,762 --> 01:17:46,786
I lost my wife,

1163
01:17:46,863 --> 01:17:49,730
I lost...

1164
01:17:49,799 --> 01:17:52,029
I lost my little girl.

1165
01:17:52,102 --> 01:17:54,093
Now, you listen to me.

1166
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:57,970
You have one family,
for good or bad.

1167
01:17:58,041 --> 01:17:59,599
And you can't ever lose this.

1168
01:17:59,676 --> 01:18:02,338
No, don't you get it?

1169
01:18:02,412 --> 01:18:04,710
I'm a drunk!

1170
01:18:04,781 --> 01:18:08,114
I'm no good to anybody.

1171
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:10,243
And I want it to stop.

1172
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:13,312
I just want it to stop.

1173
01:18:33,777 --> 01:18:36,337
Just let me go.

1174
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:40,372
No, we have
one more stop to make.

1175
01:18:40,683 --> 01:18:41,843
Mom...

1176
01:18:42,886 --> 01:18:46,014
Yeah, then you can make
your decision.

1177
01:18:47,991 --> 01:18:49,982
Come on.

1178
01:18:55,165 --> 01:18:56,860
Come on.

1179
01:19:09,479 --> 01:19:10,707
Where are we?

1180
01:19:11,748 --> 01:19:13,613
Collingswood.

1181
01:19:13,683 --> 01:19:15,412
Where Dad built his store?

1182
01:19:15,485 --> 01:19:18,682
I was only here once.

1183
01:19:18,755 --> 01:19:20,222
You see, many nights,

1184
01:19:20,290 --> 01:19:23,157
your father didn't come home.

1185
01:19:23,226 --> 01:19:24,591
After a while,
I started to think

1186
01:19:24,661 --> 01:19:26,185
he was spending
an awful lot of time

1187
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:27,388
in the Collingswood store.

1188
01:19:27,464 --> 01:19:29,694
So one night,

1189
01:19:29,766 --> 01:19:31,631
I followed him.

1190
01:20:51,814 --> 01:20:54,112
What is this?

1191
01:20:56,486 --> 01:20:57,783
She's pretty, isn't she?

1192
01:21:00,657 --> 01:21:02,989
He had a girlfriend?

1193
01:21:04,027 --> 01:21:06,120
A wife.

1194
01:21:12,869 --> 01:21:14,803
What are you talking about?

1195
01:21:15,838 --> 01:21:17,271
He married her

1196
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:19,331
in Italy during the war.

1197
01:21:19,409 --> 01:21:21,900
A lot of men died
in those mountains,

1198
01:21:21,978 --> 01:21:23,536
and I guess he got scared.

1199
01:21:23,613 --> 01:21:25,308
And, well, you know him.

1200
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:27,246
He always had
to have a plan.

1201
01:21:27,317 --> 01:21:28,841
No, no.
He wrote you that letter.

1202
01:21:28,918 --> 01:21:30,579
- He proposed to you.
- Yeah.

1203
01:21:30,653 --> 01:21:33,281
When he saw that
the war was ending,

1204
01:21:33,356 --> 01:21:34,789
he wanted his old plan back.

1205
01:21:34,857 --> 01:21:36,688
That was me.

1206
01:21:37,026 --> 01:21:39,119
But how...

1207
01:21:40,163 --> 01:21:41,494
I don't know, Charley.

1208
01:21:41,564 --> 01:21:43,862
At a certain point,
he brought her over here.

1209
01:21:43,933 --> 01:21:45,730
He got another house,
another store,

1210
01:21:45,802 --> 01:21:48,032
another life.

1211
01:21:48,104 --> 01:21:51,335
It was her lasagna
he wanted me to make.

1212
01:21:51,774 --> 01:21:53,332
It's not right.

1213
01:21:55,545 --> 01:21:58,105
That is a lie.

1214
01:21:59,148 --> 01:22:00,945
He never would have done that.

1215
01:22:01,017 --> 01:22:03,315
Aw, you're still defending him.

1216
01:22:03,386 --> 01:22:06,048
I'm his son!

1217
01:22:06,289 --> 01:22:08,951
One of his sons.

1218
01:22:28,111 --> 01:22:30,443
I'm sorry, Charley.

1219
01:22:41,624 --> 01:22:44,252
Did he play baseball?

1220
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:47,956
I don't really know.

1221
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:53,230
So what did you do?

1222
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,065
I drove home.

1223
01:23:00,109 --> 01:23:02,737
I waited.

1224
01:23:07,784 --> 01:23:09,911
When he got there,
I got in his car

1225
01:23:10,953 --> 01:23:13,979
and I made him
roll up the windows.

1226
01:23:14,057 --> 01:23:15,718
And I exploded.

1227
01:23:18,027 --> 01:23:20,222
I just let him have it,

1228
01:23:21,264 --> 01:23:23,255
until he stopped lying to me.

1229
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:24,424
What are you doing?

1230
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,491
They're my family too.

1231
01:23:26,569 --> 01:23:27,729
They are my family too.

1232
01:23:27,804 --> 01:23:29,704
They're your family?

1233
01:23:29,772 --> 01:23:32,639
He admitted the whole thing.

1234
01:23:32,709 --> 01:23:35,507
You told him to leave.

1235
01:23:35,578 --> 01:23:38,570
And to never come back.

1236
01:23:38,748 --> 01:23:40,272
Why didn't you tell me?

1237
01:23:41,317 --> 01:23:44,309
Well, I thought
of it many times.

1238
01:23:45,254 --> 01:23:47,017
Then why?

1239
01:23:49,292 --> 01:23:52,352
I couldn't stand
to hurt you that much.

1240
01:23:53,396 --> 01:23:55,990
You adored him.

1241
01:23:56,065 --> 01:23:57,327
I don't know,

1242
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,630
maybe I hurt you more
by not telling you.

1243
01:24:00,069 --> 01:24:03,505
But you let me
treat you so rotten.

1244
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:07,532
You let me believe
it was all your fault.

1245
01:24:09,512 --> 01:24:11,639
How could I have been

1246
01:24:12,682 --> 01:24:14,479
so stupid all of these years?

1247
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:16,518
I picked him over you!

1248
01:24:16,586 --> 01:24:19,487
I made the wrong choice.

1249
01:24:20,523 --> 01:24:23,515
Children shouldn't have to choose.

1250
01:24:23,593 --> 01:24:25,584
Mom!

1251
01:24:28,164 --> 01:24:31,133
You have a child of your own.

1252
01:24:32,168 --> 01:24:34,796
Make it right with her.

1253
01:24:46,082 --> 01:24:47,845
What's happening?

1254
01:24:49,051 --> 01:24:52,316
We've been together
for one more day.

1255
01:24:54,657 --> 01:24:56,488
Now it's time to give
your mother a kiss.

1256
01:24:57,527 --> 01:25:00,291
Oh, no, wait.

1257
01:25:00,363 --> 01:25:02,331
I love you, Charley.

1258
01:25:03,099 --> 01:25:05,499
I don't want to lose you again.

1259
01:25:06,536 --> 01:25:08,663
Nah, you can't lose me.

1260
01:25:08,738 --> 01:25:10,569
I'm your mother.

1261
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:13,609
We persist

1262
01:25:13,676 --> 01:25:15,974
like an echo,

1263
01:25:16,045 --> 01:25:19,742
even after the source is gone.

1264
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:22,811
And when do you hear an echo?

1265
01:25:25,488 --> 01:25:29,686
- When it's quiet.
- Yeah.

1266
01:25:32,094 --> 01:25:34,756
When it's quiet,

1267
01:25:35,798 --> 01:25:38,266
you'll be able to hear me too.

1268
01:25:39,535 --> 01:25:41,560
I'll always be right here.

1269
01:25:42,605 --> 01:25:44,072
Wait.

1270
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:46,267
Wait.

1271
01:25:49,312 --> 01:25:52,907
You were a really great mom.

1272
01:25:55,151 --> 01:25:57,312
I never told you that...

1273
01:25:58,354 --> 01:26:00,686
Mr. Benetto, are you with us?

1274
01:26:00,756 --> 01:26:01,723
Mr. Benetto.

1275
01:26:01,791 --> 01:26:04,191
Charles Benetto.

1276
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:06,854
Are you with us?

1277
01:26:06,929 --> 01:26:09,056
Stay with us.

1278
01:26:09,131 --> 01:26:11,565
We're going to move
you now, Charles.

1279
01:26:11,634 --> 01:26:12,896
Over here!

1280
01:26:12,969 --> 01:26:15,301
- Stay with us.
- One minute!

1281
01:26:15,371 --> 01:26:16,838
Come on.

1282
01:26:16,906 --> 01:26:19,466
Nice and easy.

1283
01:26:19,542 --> 01:26:21,271
I got you.

1284
01:26:21,344 --> 01:26:24,142
All right.

1285
01:26:24,213 --> 01:26:25,339
Let's get some help!

1286
01:26:25,414 --> 01:26:27,109
- Back it up!
- The truck driver...

1287
01:26:27,183 --> 01:26:30,448
Everyone's gonna be okay.

1288
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:32,510
Easy, now.

1289
01:26:41,264 --> 01:26:43,323
It's been a long road to here.

1290
01:27:02,885 --> 01:27:05,877
You closed on the house, huh?

1291
01:27:08,057 --> 01:27:09,991
Good.

1292
01:27:11,027 --> 01:27:14,019
It should stay in the family.

1293
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:19,860
Chick Benetto died last summer,

1294
01:27:20,903 --> 01:27:23,872
six years after we sat
in those bleachers.

1295
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:27,304
I want to make things right.

1296
01:27:28,344 --> 01:27:30,278
But they were the best six years

1297
01:27:30,346 --> 01:27:33,543
we had together.

1298
01:27:38,955 --> 01:27:41,321
My name is Maria Lang.

1299
01:27:42,358 --> 01:27:45,555
Before that, I was Maria Benetto.

1300
01:27:45,628 --> 01:27:48,096
Chick Benetto was my father.

1301
01:27:48,698 --> 01:27:51,292
Every family is a ghost story.

1302
01:27:52,335 --> 01:27:54,860
Sometimes, the ghosts come back.

1303
01:27:54,937 --> 01:27:58,168
Sometimes, they never left.

1304
01:28:00,443 --> 01:28:01,842
Mommy.

1305
01:28:02,878 --> 01:28:06,109
I'm coming, Charley.

1306
01:28:18,361 --> 01:28:21,353
