1
00:00:30,305 --> 00:00:35,305
- Art Subs - 9 years making art for you!

2
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:10,940
The Ciambra

3
00:02:17,483 --> 00:02:21,128
Will break the door so! The father will kill you!

4
00:02:21,258 --> 00:02:23,119
When I get out I'll give you a punch

5
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,213
that will make you fly with the door

6
00:02:25,214 --> 00:02:27,650
and will stop where the dogs are!

7
00:02:27,855 --> 00:02:29,570
You can not, Pio.

8
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,104
Pio, stop, Grandpa needs to make breakfast!

9
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,544
Come on, Pio, hurry up it's late!

10
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,842
Pisa but strong.

11
00:03:44,812 --> 00:03:46,820
Come on, I'm hungry.

12
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,266
Pio! Pio! Pio, help me!

13
00:03:51,896 --> 00:03:53,846
Pega este, Cocchi.

14
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:06,305
Pio, this bike is broken.

15
00:04:06,306 --> 00:04:09,964
- Just missing gasoline. - You are spoiled.

16
00:04:12,914 --> 00:04:15,546
Pio, why not stop it?

17
00:04:15,874 --> 00:04:17,746
And look here!

18
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,340
Pio, stop it!

19
00:04:20,776 --> 00:04:22,744
- Will you stop? - Is that you?

20
00:04:23,112 --> 00:04:25,218
Play this bike out!

21
00:04:26,906 --> 00:04:29,619
Come out, come soon.

22
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,096
Do not fill my bag.

23
00:04:31,908 --> 00:04:35,058
I'll piss in your mouth!

24
00:05:20,857 --> 00:05:22,331
I see a beer.

25
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:05,327
- Have you seen my brother? - No.

26
00:06:29,435 --> 00:06:30,787
I'm not listening.

27
00:06:30,907 --> 00:06:33,231
Who is it? I'm not listening.

28
00:06:37,674 --> 00:06:39,101
Everything in order?

29
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:42,671
How's it going with that there?

30
00:06:42,937 --> 00:06:45,617
Well. I'm almost there.

31
00:06:45,893 --> 00:06:47,675
- Want to help? - No need.

32
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,352
What help?

33
00:06:49,353 --> 00:06:51,939
He said he could get that there.

34
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:56,923
You will not get.

35
00:06:57,993 --> 00:07:01,674
- So you can not. - I can not worry.

36
00:07:01,675 --> 00:07:04,882
And when a heart attack who will take you to the hospital?

37
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,801
The blond here will take you?

38
00:07:09,743 --> 00:07:12,759
Can you or not? Can It?

39
00:07:24,995 --> 00:07:26,831
Let's see if you can.

40
00:08:47,643 --> 00:08:50,229
Do not put everything.

41
00:09:14,662 --> 00:09:17,200
You do not know burn copper.

42
00:09:17,728 --> 00:09:22,628
For God's sake, it is wet. What the fuck is my fault?

43
00:09:22,878 --> 00:09:24,832
You're ruining everything.

44
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:27,358
So do you.

45
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,632
I just got home from school. You do it.

46
00:09:30,796 --> 00:09:32,273
I am not going to school.

47
00:09:32,274 --> 00:09:34,539
You will never, so do not know how to read.

48
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,726
To learn to read? Look at this.

49
00:09:39,436 --> 00:09:41,257
Lele, come here.

50
00:09:41,258 --> 00:09:44,499
My sister put a nice outfit and maquiou.

51
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,984
Come here to kiss her.

52
00:09:47,828 --> 00:09:50,678
- It is true, Pio? - How do I know?

53
00:09:51,248 --> 00:09:53,774
Want to see? You want to show you?

54
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:55,880
Stop this. Want to see?

55
00:10:04,376 --> 00:10:06,362
Stop it!

56
00:10:07,784 --> 00:10:11,143
- Enough! - African fucking stop!

57
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:14,219
At home we get hits.

58
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:16,724
Hi guys.

59
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,733
What the hell do here? Go away!

60
00:10:23,307 --> 00:10:26,739
Are you still here? Will soon!

61
00:10:30,807 --> 00:10:33,574
- Police!
- Police!

62
00:10:35,794 --> 00:10:37,563
Police!

63
00:10:39,663 --> 00:10:42,971
The police! Police!

64
00:11:14,947 --> 00:11:17,396
Leave him alone, damn it.

65
00:11:17,397 --> 00:11:19,676
- What were you doing out here? - Just came out a little.

66
00:11:19,677 --> 00:11:22,241
- You must stay inside. - He went out to get some air.

67
00:11:22,242 --> 00:11:25,117
- Shut up, lady. - I'm the mother and I shut up?

68
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,898
There have now been put handcuffs.

69
00:11:30,902 --> 00:11:33,196
What the police doing here?

70
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,849
- they came because of the light? - No, just because it came out.

71
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,675
Curse! I hope to die these cops burned!

72
00:11:41,857 --> 00:11:43,813
- You turned off the light? - I hung up.

73
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:45,599
well yet.

74
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:48,001
Come help me.

75
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:32,927
You go with the bike.

76
00:12:32,928 --> 00:12:36,383
If you see the police, the lighthouse flashes.

77
00:12:36,384 --> 00:12:37,738
- Combined? - Combined.

78
00:13:17,828 --> 00:13:21,684
When you get a car, unlock the steering wheel,

79
00:13:22,016 --> 00:13:23,854
push the washer and turn the ignition

80
00:13:23,855 --> 00:13:25,869
with the screwdriver.

81
00:13:26,697 --> 00:13:29,602
And one more thing. This is the engine control unit.

82
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:31,837
Pull the lever.

83
00:13:32,627 --> 00:13:34,802
Then remove it and pull out.

84
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:53,718
That's how it's done. Paid attention?

85
00:13:54,905 --> 00:13:57,292
Under has two steering wires,

86
00:13:57,293 --> 00:13:59,269
one red and one black,

87
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:03,234
you join the two and the engine starts.

88
00:14:03,235 --> 00:14:05,453
And then just bring the car here.

89
00:14:09,921 --> 00:14:11,531
I give you 50 euros.

90
00:14:20,203 --> 00:14:21,927
No, I will not go.

91
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:28,529
Do not worry, I'll take the car for you.

92
00:14:31,097 --> 00:14:33,621
Yes, I'll take, I take.

93
00:14:34,037 --> 00:14:37,161
Yes. Give me the number.

94
00:14:44,465 --> 00:14:46,371
All right then.

95
00:14:48,272 --> 00:14:53,243
Yes, all right. I'll call you tomorrow. Goodbye.

96
00:14:53,932 --> 00:14:55,305
Pio!

97
00:14:56,836 --> 00:15:00,221
Let's go. It was not, hurry up.

98
00:15:00,964 --> 00:15:03,851
It was nothing. Move yourself.

99
00:15:04,244 --> 00:15:05,660
Your logo!

100
00:15:08,182 --> 00:15:10,591
And do not wash your hand, I need that number.

101
00:15:14,742 --> 00:15:17,494
- With the! - I have four women.

102
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,001
- When we drink? - Now.

103
00:15:21,002 --> 00:15:23,390
- Give a little to Grandpa. - Drink this.

104
00:15:23,764 --> 00:15:26,581
- Mom I'm hungry! - I will soon, I'm starving.

105
00:15:26,582 --> 00:15:28,866
You just gets a dish at a time?

106
00:15:34,492 --> 00:15:36,967
Give a little to Cocchino.

107
00:15:36,968 --> 00:15:40,663
- We eat like Italians. - Grandpa, let's eat like Italians.

108
00:15:40,664 --> 00:15:42,460
I want more noodles, will soon!

109
00:15:42,928 --> 00:15:44,626
I can not go.

110
00:15:45,286 --> 00:15:46,770
Goodbye.

111
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,348
- It was the Licca, your girlfriend? - Yes.

112
00:15:49,685 --> 00:15:52,341
- And what did she want? - Why do not you see it?

113
00:15:52,342 --> 00:15:55,293
I can not go, I must stay here if the police appear.

114
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,978
I can not find her.

115
00:15:57,662 --> 00:16:00,531
- Why not talk to her? - I'll be busy tomorrow.

116
00:16:01,316 --> 00:16:03,474
Drink slowly, calmly.

117
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:08,728
"Drink wine that gives you a little help."

118
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,536
Let's drink to that.

119
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,424
No, Pio. Do not ... Did you see? He drinks really.

120
00:16:19,237 --> 00:16:24,238
Look at him. Soon end up like them.

121
00:16:26,773 --> 00:16:32,429
- Health, mother. - My God! By Cosmas and Damian.

122
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:35,972
Leave that bottle or I will give you the same end of the Africans.

123
00:16:35,973 --> 00:16:38,905
- I will break it in your face. - You are drunk!

124
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:42,558
The end of africa ... What did you say?

125
00:16:43,012 --> 00:16:45,371
But why do not you slap him?

126
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:49,275
Lower that glass, wine is bad. Look at her.

127
00:16:51,042 --> 00:16:54,834
You do not see how it is? And then I'm drunk?

128
00:16:54,835 --> 00:16:57,828
I do not! No, you're drunk, I do not.

129
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:59,349
Throw away this wine.

130
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:02,957
- Play the wine. - You should hit her.

131
00:17:03,992 --> 00:17:07,455
Damn ... Now go get drunk! I'll break you.

132
00:17:07,597 --> 00:17:09,619
You'll get drunk, little sister!

133
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:13,568
- You doubt it? - Dad, she's drunk.

134
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:15,264
I want another drink.

135
00:17:15,265 --> 00:17:17,555
I will break the bottle in your head!

136
00:17:19,824 --> 00:17:22,355
Leave her alone, just a little wine.

137
00:17:22,518 --> 00:17:23,929
Cheers!

138
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:28,710
- mixed with soda. - not mixed! You are drunk!

139
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,602
I have a lot to do tonight, but ...

140
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:37,054
But what happens?

141
00:17:42,336 --> 00:17:45,028
They are all drunk as Africans.

142
00:17:47,088 --> 00:17:49,282
It is how do Africans.

143
00:17:49,466 --> 00:17:51,111
African ...

144
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,633
Africans do so, get drunk,

145
00:17:53,634 --> 00:17:57,599
bottles break after each other in the head.

146
00:17:57,973 --> 00:18:00,340
And then they slap. You do the same thing.

147
00:18:00,341 --> 00:18:03,266
You will end up as the Africans who drink.

148
00:18:04,024 --> 00:18:06,823
Last winter, my daughter Carmelina,

149
00:18:06,824 --> 00:18:11,282
He had hurt his hand on the door and took her to the hospital.

150
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:16,173
It was December or January and saw an African shirtless.

151
00:18:16,174 --> 00:18:18,728
It was almost naked, and very cold.

152
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:21,618
He was naked and you could punch the wall.

153
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:23,655
He could punch in the door.

154
00:18:23,656 --> 00:18:26,032
It was all broken out, face, arms,

155
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:28,899
It was full of blood. I was scared.

156
00:18:29,422 --> 00:18:31,906
- He gave punch at all. - And the police were there.

157
00:18:32,414 --> 00:18:35,754
- I had police there. - They beat him with ...

158
00:18:35,755 --> 00:18:41,329
The officers were dismayed with the baton.

159
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:46,101
You know what happened once? I saw one while making purchase.

160
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,982
And he told me: "Come here." I said, "What do you want?"

161
00:18:49,048 --> 00:18:52,177
And I said, "How ugly is ugly African, go away."

162
00:18:52,178 --> 00:18:53,820
He said, "No, come here."

163
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,795
He took my hand and said, "Wow, what a great hand."

164
00:18:56,796 --> 00:19:00,192
And I said, "Your ugly black, go away I'm afraid."

165
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,264
He scared me.

166
00:19:06,046 --> 00:19:07,788
I did not understand what he said.

167
00:19:10,355 --> 00:19:13,944
He said that when drunk trying to steal his animals.

168
00:19:14,118 --> 00:19:15,964
When I drank.

169
00:19:16,564 --> 00:19:18,607
No one could fool the dad.

170
00:19:18,608 --> 00:19:21,788
- Do not smoke much, Pio. - Leave me alone.

171
00:19:24,745 --> 00:19:28,103
- Pio, you turned off the power? - No.

172
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,607
How not?

173
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:32,556
You can not go on like this. How will we pay the light?

174
00:19:32,557 --> 00:19:35,245
- Who will give us money? - How do I know?

175
00:19:35,399 --> 00:19:37,414
- Did not know? - How do I know?

176
00:19:37,415 --> 00:19:39,427
Instead of walking behind his brother,

177
00:19:39,729 --> 00:19:42,585
do what I say.

178
00:19:44,145 --> 00:19:47,761
- Understood? Go, get moving. - Go connect the wires.

179
00:20:27,345 --> 00:20:29,368
Mother. Mother!

180
00:20:31,838 --> 00:20:33,636
- At where? - Out there.

181
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:40,860
- Good evening. - Good evening.

182
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,170
A word.

183
00:20:57,642 --> 00:21:00,117
- Where are you going? - Let me go.

184
00:21:00,118 --> 00:21:03,295
- You can not come with me. - Do not fill my bag!

185
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:04,834
You can not come with me!

186
00:21:07,639 --> 00:21:10,426
- Let's see if you now to. - No, no.

187
00:21:11,441 --> 00:21:13,471
If you drop, you go to the shop?

188
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:15,539
No, I'm not going! Stop!

189
00:21:15,831 --> 00:21:18,300
- I will not follow you. - Are you sure?

190
00:21:18,301 --> 00:21:19,753
Have. Please...

191
00:21:20,365 --> 00:21:23,849
Go back inside. You can not come with me.

192
00:21:24,382 --> 00:21:26,626
- Will soon! - Will you stop it?

193
00:21:26,627 --> 00:21:28,307
Close the door!

194
00:21:29,461 --> 00:21:32,851
- That's good? - Go to sleep and do not fill the bag.

195
00:21:33,615 --> 00:21:35,147
And do not cry.

196
00:21:35,515 --> 00:21:37,754
Gosh, I do not know what to do.

197
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,903
He did not listen to me.

198
00:21:40,964 --> 00:21:42,380
It's driving me crazy.

199
00:21:42,381 --> 00:21:44,487
I do not know what to do, can not stand it.

200
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:23,416
How often should I say not to steal in Gioia Tauro?

201
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:24,813
No one took nothing there.

202
00:22:24,814 --> 00:22:26,640
Only we took cars in Reggio Calabria.

203
00:22:26,641 --> 00:22:28,198
They do not know the black Fiat Punto?

204
00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:29,525
No, no.

205
00:22:29,526 --> 00:22:31,980
But if he were here, I think would not you?

206
00:22:32,245 --> 00:22:35,219
- Only if you talked about it all day. - he's gone a Fiat Punto black.

207
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,952
I also theft, but did not get that car.

208
00:22:38,953 --> 00:22:43,193
- And you do not know anything? - Anything. I'll get them in Reggio.

209
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:46,470
- All right, beauty. - I'll pretend that nothing happened.

210
00:22:46,471 --> 00:22:48,693
Let's let it go, it's just a car.

211
00:22:48,994 --> 00:22:54,265
But we have work to do. We will go to a house in Tonnara.

212
00:22:54,266 --> 00:22:56,679
- When? - Today they will go to a wedding.

213
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,665
- You can go? - I go. I am free.

214
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:00,086
Go alone?

215
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,728
Thank you.

216
00:25:14,852 --> 00:25:19,148
I get this room. I do not want to be arrested, hurry up.

217
00:25:24,184 --> 00:25:25,596
Come here! Where do you think you're going?

218
00:25:52,495 --> 00:25:54,364
Gypsy shit.

219
00:26:00,254 --> 00:26:01,788
Hello, is the police?

220
00:26:01,813 --> 00:26:03,904
Send a car to my house.

221
00:26:04,044 --> 00:26:05,642
It has to be fast.

222
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,438
It has a gang of gypsies who are stealing everything.

223
00:26:16,184 --> 00:26:17,819
Scinà, nº 15.

224
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:21,380
They must come soon if you can, do not know what to do.

225
00:26:22,254 --> 00:26:24,888
Please send the car soon.

226
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,120
Where are you going?

227
00:27:21,378 --> 00:27:24,426
- Has a suitcase here. - You can check.

228
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,340
I want to see the documents.

229
00:27:28,468 --> 00:27:31,134
- They are at home. - Give me the documents.

230
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,630
Stay still.

231
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:46,270
The car!

232
00:28:58,775 --> 00:29:00,979
Police!

233
00:29:13,222 --> 00:29:14,806
Leave him alone.

234
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,380
What's this here?

235
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,919
- Two wires. - Two wires?

236
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,965
Can hold it, it goes to the police station.

237
00:29:49,966 --> 00:29:51,588
Why will arrest him?

238
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:54,125
Never go in the other houses, always come here.

239
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,730
You just come here. Leave him alone!

240
00:29:56,977 --> 00:29:58,552
Doin 'it!

241
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:02,774
Let go! What did he do?

242
00:30:04,342 --> 00:30:06,558
You run, run and always come here!

243
00:30:07,728 --> 00:30:10,016
It seems like they are holding Totò Riina.

244
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:13,152
Run, run, and always end up here.

245
00:30:56,882 --> 00:30:59,474
Mother, you see, are the Italians.

246
00:30:59,622 --> 00:31:01,109
They go inside.

247
00:31:02,906 --> 00:31:06,568
Come on. Quick, go inside.

248
00:31:18,821 --> 00:31:21,476
- They made fire, Iolanda? - Yes i's cold.

249
00:31:21,477 --> 00:31:23,189
- Good afternoon. - Good afternoon.

250
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:24,781
My boys.

251
00:31:26,256 --> 00:31:29,669
- For him. - Thanks.

252
00:31:30,547 --> 00:31:33,041
I heard they arrested the boy.

253
00:31:33,235 --> 00:31:37,391
- What can we do? - It happens to the living.

254
00:31:37,571 --> 00:31:39,335
What's that saying?

255
00:31:39,569 --> 00:31:42,434
Best hear the sound of chains that the sound of bells.

256
00:31:42,441 --> 00:31:44,922
- He'll leave.
- You will not be there forever.

257
00:31:44,923 --> 00:31:48,017
And he did nothing. Will soon, for sure.

258
00:31:49,188 --> 00:31:52,156
I spoke to the car owner.

259
00:31:52,671 --> 00:31:55,613
Will be in Piazza dell'Incontro tonight.

260
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:58,765
- All right.
- We combine 300 euros.

261
00:31:58,766 --> 00:32:00,969
- That 's right.
- You take care of that?

262
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,375
Do not worry.

263
00:32:03,074 --> 00:32:06,434
Later send a boy to resolve the matter.

264
00:32:06,435 --> 00:32:07,863
- It's all right. - It's all right?

265
00:32:07,864 --> 00:32:10,385
- Thank you, Mrs. Iolanda.. - Thanks. Good afternoon.

266
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,963
- If you need anything, let me know. - Thanks.

267
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:15,736
- We see later.
- Bye.

268
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:28,494
Pio! Pio ...

269
00:32:28,848 --> 00:32:31,510
I know you're back there. Come here.

270
00:32:32,586 --> 00:32:34,219
Pio;

271
00:32:38,474 --> 00:32:41,891
-  - No, I take.

272
00:32:41,892 --> 00:32:43,909
- You can not go. - Why not?

273
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:46,597
Nanà will take you! Why do not you listen?

274
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:50,181
-  - Why do not you listen to me?

275
00:32:50,182 --> 00:32:52,890
Like his father is not here, do you think that says?

276
00:32:53,112 --> 00:32:54,674
Why that?

277
00:32:55,454 --> 00:32:58,040
Come on, move. Listen to what I say.

278
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:00,324
Or.

279
00:33:23,227 --> 00:33:25,102
You're hurting me.

280
00:33:25,397 --> 00:33:26,973
What the hell do you want?

281
00:33:26,974 --> 00:33:28,587
Read this message to me.

282
00:33:28,768 --> 00:33:31,800
- Read it. - I can read by any chance?

283
00:33:39,191 --> 00:33:42,504
"I tried to call you, but no one answered."

284
00:33:44,246 --> 00:33:47,736
- Get out of here. - Not thanks. Fuck you!

285
00:33:49,769 --> 00:33:51,288
Hello?

286
00:33:52,062 --> 00:33:54,140
Because the car.

287
00:33:55,709 --> 00:33:58,464
Yes sure. See you tonight.

288
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:02,652
No, not in the square. At the station.

289
00:34:05,118 --> 00:34:06,840
Yes of course.

290
00:34:08,645 --> 00:34:11,983
Beauty. It's all right. Goodbye.

291
00:35:21,797 --> 00:35:24,829
He's a big jerk, but you're cute.

292
00:35:25,503 --> 00:35:29,522
- Leave him in peace. - Fuck you both.

293
00:35:32,024 --> 00:35:34,005
Forget it, it's a bitch.

294
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,693
Why are you here? I knew your brother.

295
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:38,370
- He is fine? - It is.

296
00:35:39,233 --> 00:35:41,711
- Why are you here? - I was looking for you.

297
00:35:41,712 --> 00:35:43,157
- Looking for me? - That.

298
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:45,508
- What you want? - Need help.

299
00:35:50,278 --> 00:35:52,029
Yes Yes.

300
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:55,233
We are coming.

301
00:35:57,074 --> 00:35:59,705
Give me about 20 minutes.

302
00:36:00,204 --> 00:36:02,115
Beauty? Goodbye.

303
00:36:08,254 --> 00:36:10,288
Now try to join the two wires.

304
00:36:17,226 --> 00:36:18,738
- Beauty. - That's how it's done.

305
00:36:20,162 --> 00:36:23,230
- Thanks. Goodbye. - Wait, where are you?

306
00:36:23,278 --> 00:36:24,651
Take the car.

307
00:36:24,652 --> 00:36:26,641
You can not drive, leave to another.

308
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,137
- Because? - You are child.

309
00:36:28,138 --> 00:36:30,596
- What a child! - Send someone else to take.

310
00:36:30,726 --> 00:36:33,042
- Screw U. - Hang on! Where are you going?

311
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:35,224
Stopped.

312
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,006
I know how to drive.

313
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:53,304
Will soon it's late.

314
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,782
Beauty. Goodbye.

315
00:37:03,468 --> 00:37:06,131
- Enough. - Got it arrives.

316
00:37:06,132 --> 00:37:08,324
Come here. Look deep into my eyes.

317
00:37:09,306 --> 00:37:10,636
Ended.

318
00:37:11,502 --> 00:37:14,740
I do not want to go to jail or go back to Burkina Faso.

319
00:37:15,386 --> 00:37:18,250
And I do not want to send you to boarding school.

320
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,072
Yes, arrives.

321
00:37:22,228 --> 00:37:24,576
- Understood? - Got it.

322
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:29,202
- Did you understand what I said? - Yes.

323
00:37:32,286 --> 00:37:34,552
Thank you for real.

324
00:38:06,134 --> 00:38:08,757
- You're the guy from Turin? - And who are you?

325
00:38:08,758 --> 00:38:11,557
- The guy's car. - The car? And where is he?

326
00:38:11,558 --> 00:38:12,924
First pass the money.

327
00:38:20,674 --> 00:38:22,152
That's right.

328
00:38:27,314 --> 00:38:30,632
Are 300 euros, should give me 10.

329
00:38:30,736 --> 00:38:33,807
Ten more? But the deal was 300.

330
00:38:33,808 --> 00:38:37,928
We are a station, take the train and go home.

331
00:38:38,102 --> 00:38:40,115
I'm leaving when you give me the car.

332
00:38:40,116 --> 00:38:41,567
No, the car still with me.

333
00:38:41,568 --> 00:38:44,636
But the deal was 300. Come here, come back here.

334
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:49,904
He knew he should not come to this city.

335
00:38:51,592 --> 00:38:53,759
Take, here are 310.

336
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,665
- Where is my car? - is nearby.

337
00:38:57,666 --> 00:39:00,089
- Close to where? - At Palazzo Verdi.

338
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:03,562
- But I'm not in town. - You will find the car.

339
00:39:03,805 --> 00:39:05,441
But look ...

340
00:39:44,499 --> 00:39:46,212
Stop it, please return.

341
00:39:46,213 --> 00:39:48,584
You will not do it, is not an idiot like him.

342
00:39:48,585 --> 00:39:51,867
You threw my phone on fire and the idiot am I?

343
00:39:52,418 --> 00:39:54,745
No problem, buy one for you.

344
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,465
How much do you want?

345
00:39:57,231 --> 00:39:59,806
- Where did you get this money? - In the bank.

346
00:39:59,807 --> 00:40:01,565
- Of course ... - It's true.

347
00:40:02,101 --> 00:40:04,736
- I'm not kidding. - Tomorrow we will go together to the bank.

348
00:40:04,737 --> 00:40:07,951
Can be. Tomorrow up early and come with me.

349
00:40:08,923 --> 00:40:10,275
What caught?

350
00:40:10,723 --> 00:40:12,845
give you 200, do you?

351
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:16,851
- Do you want? Whether or not? - Stop this!

352
00:40:17,077 --> 00:40:19,941
- Would you like? - Stop, Pius!

353
00:40:21,901 --> 00:40:26,323
- Give me 10 euros. - Only that? I'll give you 50.

354
00:40:26,435 --> 00:40:28,503
Come on, give me 5 euros.

355
00:40:28,724 --> 00:40:30,925
Only if you wash your ass with the air pump.

356
00:40:31,067 --> 00:40:34,576
- As you're mean! - His face is black.

357
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:37,121
Look who's talking, the girls do not want you.

358
00:40:37,122 --> 00:40:39,972
You are the handsome, with those teeth excavator.

359
00:40:40,324 --> 00:40:43,763
- Beauty, I go home. - Pio, can not go home.

360
00:40:43,764 --> 00:40:45,791
- Because? - They are talking.

361
00:40:45,792 --> 00:40:49,109
- They sent me out too. - Because you're small.

362
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:52,024
- Screw you, go! - Go take a shower!

363
00:41:01,344 --> 00:41:04,692
Pio, where the hell have you been?

364
00:41:04,853 --> 00:41:08,387
I sent you take the car to Nanà and come back here.

365
00:41:08,388 --> 00:41:11,198
Two hours ago I'm waiting for you! Where did you go?

366
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:19,778
- And the money? - Is the car money.

367
00:41:20,131 --> 00:41:22,612
Of car? But why not venture?

368
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:26,306
Longer worry about your brother, you also want to be arrested?

369
00:41:27,122 --> 00:41:29,390
- And how he took the car? - Alone.

370
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:32,725
- What if the police stop you? - Do not do anything.

371
00:41:32,726 --> 00:41:35,824
No? They would take you to the bar and would take coffee together.

372
00:41:36,984 --> 00:41:38,642
The whole family in jail!

373
00:41:38,643 --> 00:41:41,809
They in jail and you too, just like family.

374
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:46,203
And then I am alone, right? Tell me how to nourish home.

375
00:41:46,489 --> 00:41:50,532
- Grandma, he brought you the money. - Come out! Get out of here!

376
00:41:50,533 --> 00:41:52,315
Stop this!

377
00:41:52,797 --> 00:41:55,133
You'll drive me crazy, you know?

378
00:41:55,267 --> 00:41:58,909
It is two hours that you expect and did not know what to think.

379
00:41:59,321 --> 00:42:01,822
You took the car! Why not venture?

380
00:42:01,823 --> 00:42:06,359
If I gave the car to Nanà, he would take our money!

381
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:10,084
But why did you take? I will break you!

382
00:42:10,085 --> 00:42:13,619
- Why do not you listen to me? - Okay, I brought the money.

383
00:42:13,798 --> 00:42:16,047
- Now I'm leaving. - And where are you?

384
00:42:16,163 --> 00:42:19,429
- Where are you going? - I'm going for a walk.

385
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:23,307
Can not stand it, I'll go crazy. They will kill me.

386
00:42:24,592 --> 00:42:27,157
- Pio, where are you? - Up there.

387
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,796
What did you steal?

388
00:43:01,042 --> 00:43:02,556
Baby.

389
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:05,862
- Take the glass, Pio. - Five euros.

390
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:07,502
Five euros.

391
00:43:07,766 --> 00:43:09,360
- Cheers. - Health.

392
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:11,256
What will you do?

393
00:43:40,448 --> 00:43:41,994
Good evening, ma'am.

394
00:43:43,806 --> 00:43:45,689
We seek the covers that you stole.

395
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,143
At this time?

396
00:44:26,474 --> 00:44:29,046
Here you go, ma'am. This is the warrant.

397
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,229
Now they will break down the door.

398
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:34,680
Check right there, then see the other room.

399
00:44:34,681 --> 00:44:38,380
- Look good and will find it all. - you will not find anything.

400
00:44:38,381 --> 00:44:40,881
- And who is this boy? - My son.

401
00:44:40,973 --> 00:44:42,509
Come on.

402
00:44:43,075 --> 00:44:46,907
This will not be the last time.

403
00:45:01,504 --> 00:45:03,826
- This is the account. - How much is it?

404
00:45:04,155 --> 00:45:06,604
- Nine thousand euros. - Nine thousand euros?

405
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:10,220
And it is written to when you need to pay?

406
00:45:10,372 --> 00:45:13,024
- Is it not written? - No.

407
00:45:13,128 --> 00:45:16,028
I still had plenty of time to pay.

408
00:45:16,064 --> 00:45:19,360
- No, this is the consumption of light. - How shall we do?

409
00:48:01,526 --> 00:48:07,075
- Sergio, you saw Ayiva? - No, but it must be there.

410
00:48:25,727 --> 00:48:28,643
- Did you see the Ayiva? - No.

411
00:48:37,521 --> 00:48:39,517
You saw the Ayiva?

412
00:48:42,067 --> 00:48:44,273
No, no.

413
00:49:15,023 --> 00:49:17,465
Your friend is there.

414
00:49:31,264 --> 00:49:33,406
- Come see a thing. - How is it?

415
00:49:33,407 --> 00:49:35,737
- I want to show you something. - What is?

416
00:49:46,415 --> 00:49:47,807
Works.

00:49:47,955 --> 00:49:49,607
- How much do you want? - Hundred.

418
00:49:49,965 --> 00:49:51,815
- Hundred? - That.

419
00:49:51,961 --> 00:49:56,007
- I do not need this. - But nobody wants to buy?

420
00:49:56,403 --> 00:49:58,827
I need money, find someone who wants to.

421
00:50:01,773 --> 00:50:04,615
Jennifer! Come here.

422
00:50:31,724 --> 00:50:33,335

- To Rosarno. - And how are we going?

424
00:50:34,997 --> 00:50:38,153
- By train. - No, I will not.

425
00:50:39,253 --> 00:50:44,291
- Want to sell it? - I'm afraid to train.

426
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,142
I will not go.

427
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,124
- Because? - I do not want.

428
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:25,510
Pass the tablet here.

429
00:51:27,952 --> 00:51:29,870
I'll wait on the bike.

430
00:51:53,212 --> 00:51:54,982

00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:57,678
- How much you got? - Seventy.

I only got 70. Take this. And this is for me.

434
00:52:03,596 --> 00:52:05,426
- Do not. - Stop it, Pio.

00:52:05,874 --> 00:52:07,642
- I sent stop. - Give me.

436
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:11,643
- Stop! This is how it works with me? - Yes. Give the money here.

437
00:52:11,644 --> 00:52:13,222
- Really? - Yeah. Give here.

438
00:52:13,602 --> 00:52:16,214
Okay, you can stay. See what I do with you.

439
00:52:16,396 --> 00:52:17,814
Observe.

440
00:52:21,396 --> 00:52:23,843
Take these 10 euros, buy train passage

441
00:52:23,844 --> 00:52:25,560

442
00:52:26,942 --> 00:52:28,960
Where the hell you going?

443
00:52:48,404 --> 00:52:51,558
Run the train comes, this is the last.

00:52:59,834 --> 00:53:02,442
Or catch the last train or going to sleep here.

00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:42,784
Let's raise some money?

451
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:50,470
I need to finish something.

452
00:56:51,432 --> 00:56:52,798

And your wife?

We are only three of us.

00:58:37,379 --> 00:58:39,652
- You also smoke? - What?

459
00:58:39,778 --> 00:58:43,384

Try it, it will not hurt.

463
00:58:50,332 --> 00:58:52,108
No, no.

464
00:58:57,684 --> 00:58:59,854
- Where did you find this? - Around.

465
00:59:00,012 --> 00:59:01,576
- Around? - That.

00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:04,260
Beauty.

00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:08,541
- I need TV. - What did he say?

468
00:59:08,542 --> 00:59:11,215
He spoke Italian, he said it needs television.

469
00:59:11,216 --> 00:59:15,008
This one is for me, but just for me.

470
00:59:15,202 --> 00:59:19,642
I need a big TV for everyone.

471
00:59:19,736 --> 00:59:22,891
Because you will have football game.

472
00:59:40,116 --> 00:59:42,827
What? What did he say?

473
00:59:44,589 --> 00:59:46,647
He said he needs a TV.

474
00:59:47,395 --> 00:59:49,794
I have one, but I can not bring today

475
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:52,019

00:59:54,283 --> 00:59:56,433
- I need to work. - I bring myself.

477
00:59:56,637 --> 00:59:58,093
Alone?

478
01:00:03,681 --> 01:00:05,056

01:00:05,057 --> 01:00:07,489
- What gives 200 for everything. - Right.

01:00:07,808 --> 01:00:10,609

I will not come here for four hundred.

01:00:20,463 --> 01:00:22,815
- I bring. - I can not wait.

483
01:00:23,061 --> 01:00:25,610
- Tomorrow no longer need. - Not now.

484
01:00:25,611 --> 01:00:27,899
- Now? - I swear.

485
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:29,867
You said you swear?

486
01:00:32,235 --> 01:00:36,125
You know how to say "I swear" in my country?

487
01:00:42,531 --> 01:00:43,975
What did you say?

488
01:00:43,976 --> 01:00:47,397
Now that you said it should bring the TV tonight.

489
01:00:47,775 --> 01:00:51,103
- Beauty. See you. - I will be waiting for you.

490
01:00:52,633 --> 01:00:54,087
I'll wait.

491
01:01:10,626 --> 01:01:12,521
What is all this?

492
01:01:12,522 --> 01:01:15,895
I will fill this warehouse and when full,

493
01:01:16,019 --> 01:01:19,112
picked up a container, send everything to Burkina Faso,

494
01:01:19,113 --> 01:01:21,087
seeing and I'm done.

495
01:01:22,857 --> 01:01:24,863
This is called trade.

496
01:01:28,759 --> 01:01:30,265
The TV is this.

497
01:01:33,407 --> 01:01:36,165
But I'm finding you very strange, why?

498
01:01:36,973 --> 01:01:38,343
I am fine.

499
01:01:39,013 --> 01:01:41,217
Life is a little complicated.

500
01:01:41,513 --> 01:01:43,631
When do you think is advancing

501
01:01:44,221 --> 01:01:46,231
begins to turn back.

502
01:01:48,077 --> 01:01:50,355
But is not it better to get a train?

503
01:01:53,202 --> 01:01:56,349
That's right. Need to work. How will you take?

504
01:01:56,350 --> 01:01:59,284
You work in the same place where my sister works?

505
01:01:59,365 --> 01:02:01,438
Yes, but only when they need it.

506
01:02:01,558 --> 01:02:04,340
That house is beautiful, there is real money.

507
01:02:06,342 --> 01:02:09,026
Bother to take the TV and not on other things.

508
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:10,573
How will you take?

509
01:02:11,024 --> 01:02:12,448
So, you see?

510
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:17,548
You are just like an African woman.

511
01:02:17,913 --> 01:02:20,772
I'll put you in the container, send to Africa

512
01:02:20,773 --> 01:02:23,145
- and you'll be fine there. - Goodbye.

513
01:02:25,881 --> 01:02:28,981
- Send for Kingsley. - Leave it to me.

514
01:02:47,581 --> 01:02:49,187
Klinsere.

515
01:02:49,743 --> 01:02:52,375
- How is it? - Klins?

516
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,457
- O homeland? - Klins.

517
01:02:56,573 --> 01:02:59,037
How's his name ... that you were here.

518
01:02:59,213 --> 01:03:02,193
- you mean Kingsley. - Yeah, where is he?

519
01:03:02,355 --> 01:03:04,231
- It's in the bar. - What bar?

520
01:03:04,392 --> 01:03:06,659
- That one. It's not far. - Where is?

521
01:03:08,581 --> 01:03:10,757
Come to show you.

522
01:03:17,823 --> 01:03:19,505
Kingsley!

523
01:03:20,095 --> 01:03:22,519
- What's it? - He's looking for you.

524
01:03:26,831 --> 01:03:28,451
- thought? - I found.

525
01:03:41,582 --> 01:03:43,580
No, give me money, I need to come back.

526
01:03:43,581 --> 01:03:46,513
- No, stay here. - Give me the money.

527
01:03:47,529 --> 01:03:51,362
- I need to go. - Pio, do not do it.

528
01:03:51,513 --> 01:03:55,457
Friends, he brought television and is called Pio.

529
01:03:55,719 --> 01:03:57,905
- Pio. - Pio.

530
01:03:58,919 --> 01:04:00,367
Did you see?

531
01:04:00,765 --> 01:04:04,349
- Pio, Pio! - Pio, Pio!

532
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,333
Come on.

533
01:04:18,775 --> 01:04:20,623
Take the beer here.

534
01:04:21,161 --> 01:04:23,722
Pio, Pio!

535
01:04:38,863 --> 01:04:41,139
How are you? You are at ease?

536
01:04:41,867 --> 01:04:43,831
You see all these people?

537
01:04:44,109 --> 01:04:45,526
They are Ghanaians.

538
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:48,802
I am Nigerian.

539
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:51,318
- Where you are from? - From Gioia.

540
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:53,962
Gioia Tauro? You gypsy?

541
01:04:55,906 --> 01:04:57,640
I like the Gypsies.

542
01:04:58,168 --> 01:04:59,614
Legal.

543
01:04:59,790 --> 01:05:01,990
- Do you have a house? - No.

544
01:05:02,092 --> 01:05:03,550
Por countryside?

545
01:05:04,244 --> 01:05:06,824
You're beautiful, why not have a house?

546
01:05:34,304 --> 01:05:37,654
- Pio, Pio! - Pio, Pio!

547
01:05:41,632 --> 01:05:43,420
- I'm sure. - No, no.

548
01:05:44,792 --> 01:05:46,368
Our mother.

549
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:57,042
Okay, you're a good boy.

550
01:05:57,296 --> 01:05:58,786
That's the way I like it.

551
01:05:59,028 --> 01:06:01,924
See, we are all Gypsies.

552
01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:06,510
Here we are all equal.

553
01:06:30,802 --> 01:06:33,033
- You are here? - Yes.

554
01:06:33,034 --> 01:06:34,525
What the hell are you doing here?

555
01:06:36,304 --> 01:06:37,768
What are you doing here?

556
01:06:41,588 --> 01:06:45,331
- Are not you working? - You know what time it is?

557
01:06:45,332 --> 01:06:46,782
No, what time is it?

558
01:06:48,767 --> 01:06:50,273
He's fine, Ayiva.

559
01:06:50,274 --> 01:06:51,865
- All right, all right? - I am.

560
01:06:51,866 --> 01:06:53,601
- Are you alright? - Yes.

561
01:07:12,314 --> 01:07:14,382
- Are you alright? - I am.

562
01:07:35,842 --> 01:07:40,045
Since you are a good boy. What a good boy.

563
01:07:42,173 --> 01:07:45,499
Are you sleepy? It is stinking of beer.

564
01:07:46,099 --> 01:07:50,221
- What you want? - You stink of beer.

565
01:07:50,717 --> 01:07:52,593
It is stinking of beer.

566
01:07:53,155 --> 01:07:55,084
- Did you drink beer? - No.

567
01:07:55,085 --> 01:07:58,213
- No? Are you sure? - No!

568
01:08:00,967 --> 01:08:02,983
You stink beer, get out of there!

569
01:08:10,403 --> 01:08:13,359
You will hurt him. Will make you choke.

570
01:08:13,537 --> 01:08:16,797
Will leave you dizzy. He will choke.

571
01:08:23,753 --> 01:08:25,749
I'll kill him.

572
01:08:26,051 --> 01:08:28,327
You're crazy, go there.

573
01:08:30,546 --> 01:08:32,413
Pass the ball!

574
01:08:39,767 --> 01:08:41,761
Pio!

575
01:08:42,579 --> 01:08:46,459
Grandpa is in the shop, go help him with the car.

576
01:09:29,633 --> 01:09:33,413
Pio, I was born in this wagon.

577
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:40,689
Come here. Come, Pio.

578
01:09:46,671 --> 01:09:49,466
Before we were always on the road.

579
01:09:49,467 --> 01:09:51,695
Always on the road.

580
01:09:52,008 --> 01:09:54,701
We were free, without bosses.

581
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:58,158
We were free, we should not have anything to anyone.

582
01:09:58,159 --> 01:10:01,109
We were free and we were always on the road.

583
01:10:01,444 --> 01:10:03,443
And now we're here.

584
01:10:05,065 --> 01:10:06,935
Remember if.

585
01:10:07,551 --> 01:10:11,145
Us against the world.

586
01:10:11,737 --> 01:10:13,673
Against the world.

587
01:10:30,972 --> 01:10:33,379
What are you doing?

588
01:10:34,847 --> 01:10:36,631
What the fuck are you doing?

589
01:10:37,428 --> 01:10:40,198
- If playing in front of the car? - Excuse me.

590
01:10:40,199 --> 01:10:42,023
Do not fill the bag!

591
01:10:43,241 --> 01:10:46,079
Take your hand away and get out.

592
01:11:32,013 --> 01:11:34,975
- What's it? - Anything.

593
01:11:46,045 --> 01:11:49,517
There are many Africans who have car?

594
01:11:49,647 --> 01:11:51,881
There are some, but not many.

595
01:11:53,993 --> 01:11:55,599
Por countryside?

596
01:11:56,533 --> 01:12:00,034
Why not sell spare parts for them?

597
01:12:07,314 --> 01:12:09,512
You should not think about stealing cars.

598
01:12:15,966 --> 01:12:17,408
Come on.

599
01:14:46,568 --> 01:14:48,977
Pio ... Pio!

600
01:14:49,172 --> 01:14:51,364
An important thing happened.

601
01:16:17,211 --> 01:16:21,469
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

602
01:16:21,856 --> 01:16:23,237
Let's pray.

603
01:16:23,957 --> 01:16:27,870
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee,

604
01:16:27,871 --> 01:16:30,350
Blessed art thou among women

605
01:16:30,351 --> 01:16:33,301
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

606
01:16:33,323 --> 01:16:34,945
Santa Maria ...

607
01:16:35,095 --> 01:16:39,943
Dear brothers in the pursuit, according to the Christian rite,

01:16:50,168 --> 01:16:55,952
We deliver to earth the body of this our brother, Emiliano.

612
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:01,437
in the hope of his resurrection and ask that his soul

613
01:17:01,438 --> 01:17:03,846
is received in the glorious Communion of Saints.

614
01:17:04,352 --> 01:17:07,267

617
01:17:14,772 --> 01:17:16,107
in the presence of the eternal King.

618
01:17:16,108 --> 01:17:19,160
Let us leave because Grandpa.

619
01:17:19,236 --> 01:17:21,726
Let us pray for families.

620
01:17:22,352 --> 01:17:25,744
The Iolanda daughter, her husband Rocco,

621
01:17:26,044 --> 01:17:29,309
their sons, Simona, Antonella,

622
01:17:29,310 --> 01:17:33,720

623
01:17:34,206 --> 01:17:37,730

01:17:37,893 --> 01:17:41,493
Cosimo, Gesuele Massimo, Cristina

625
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:43,361
and Francesco Pio.

626
01:17:43,635 --> 01:17:46,603
And her other daughter, Simona.

627
01:19:26,599 --> 01:19:29,505
Why do not you tell me things of jail?

628
01:19:29,626 --> 01:19:32,913
What the hell do I care chain, Pio?

629
01:19:34,863 --> 01:19:38,973
When you were arrested, I supported the family.

630
01:19:42,189 --> 01:19:44,715
Why do not we do something together?

631
01:19:44,854 --> 01:19:47,063
I know what you want?

632
01:19:47,218 --> 01:19:48,931
Let's steal.

633
01:19:50,597 --> 01:19:54,927
You are small, where you want to go? Tell me where you're going.

634
01:19:56,241 --> 01:19:59,715
Do not fill my bag.

635
01:20:00,236 --> 01:20:04,330
- You will take care of the Italians? - I'm not afraid of them.

636
01:20:07,388 --> 01:20:10,764
Get out of here! Skirt that is filling me.

637
01:20:12,202 --> 01:20:14,058
I sent out.

638
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:17,354
Get out as soon as it is annoying me.

639
01:21:14,908 --> 01:21:17,476
Excuse me, my ball fell inside.

640
01:21:17,614 --> 01:21:19,068
And what you want now?

641
01:21:19,382 --> 01:21:21,120
Want to play ball?

642
01:21:21,834 --> 01:21:24,992
It's just a boy, go get the ball this time.

643
01:21:25,132 --> 01:21:27,728
But soon I'm hungry, Dad.

644
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:29,754
That's right.

645
01:21:55,566 --> 01:21:58,128
Here's your ball. Go play somewhere else.

646
01:21:58,258 --> 01:22:01,466
If it falls here again, I will stick it, you know?

647
01:22:02,123 --> 01:22:03,588
Go, get out of here.

648
01:23:39,038 --> 01:23:41,775
- What are you doing here? - I came to get the ball.

649
01:23:41,776 --> 01:23:43,192
Come here.

650
01:23:43,344 --> 01:23:46,988
so enter the homes of others? How dare you come in here?

651
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:49,917
- What was I going to do? - I came because of the ball.

652
01:23:50,757 --> 01:23:53,681
- Are you sure that was the ball? - It's the ball.

653
01:23:54,705 --> 01:23:56,965
And what's that bag?

654
01:24:00,065 --> 01:24:02,841
Bring it here. You can bring, Michele.

655
01:24:02,985 --> 01:24:04,755
You got something?

656
01:25:11,899 --> 01:25:15,133
Tell your father what you done.

657
01:25:17,327 --> 01:25:19,469
Tell what you've been up to.

658
01:25:19,613 --> 01:25:22,388
If you do not explain, I'll explain.

659
01:25:22,694 --> 01:25:25,322
I went to get the ball,

660
01:25:25,762 --> 01:25:30,300
I saw a computer and a picture, and got it.

661
01:25:32,782 --> 01:25:34,460
And what else?

662
01:25:34,514 --> 01:25:37,530
Come on, talk. Tell me what ready.

663
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:43,174
Tell your mother what ready.

664
01:25:44,685 --> 01:25:47,194
You know how long I know your family?

665
01:25:47,352 --> 01:25:48,916
You come into my house,

666
01:25:49,904 --> 01:25:54,454
sacaneia me and politely asks you to return the ball.

667
01:25:54,834 --> 01:25:57,346
I was leaving in a hurry with my family.

668
01:25:57,538 --> 01:26:01,782
I stopped to return the ball. He said, "Come back tomorrow."

669
01:26:04,585 --> 01:26:07,840
I never dare to go to my house.

670
01:26:08,261 --> 01:26:11,575
Or you'll end up dead. Understood?

671
01:26:11,576 --> 01:26:15,334
If he does not know you, I would have killed you today.

672
01:26:15,526 --> 01:26:16,925
That is wrong.

673
01:26:16,926 --> 01:26:18,768
Thank that I know his family.

674
01:26:18,822 --> 01:26:20,764
By knowing your brother, you know?

675
01:26:21,033 --> 01:26:24,356
Otherwise, tonight would not have ended well. Understood?

676
01:26:26,195 --> 01:26:28,843
- Apologize to all of them. - I'm sorry.

677
01:26:28,985 --> 01:26:31,331
For all. Even to his sister.

678
01:26:31,457 --> 01:26:33,379
Excuse me.

679
01:26:35,649 --> 01:26:37,935
Rocco, you'll pay the damages of the house.

680
01:26:38,039 --> 01:26:41,131
How much damage he gave?

681
01:26:41,259 --> 01:26:43,123
About 8000 euros injury.

682
01:26:43,124 --> 01:26:46,591
You will pay the damage he caused.

683
01:26:46,592 --> 01:26:49,767
Of course, Pasquale. See value and pay without problems.

684
01:26:49,768 --> 01:26:52,484
- What can we do? - You are a bastard.

685
01:26:52,661 --> 01:26:55,638
- It's not right, Pius

686
01:26:56,083 --> 01:26:57,955
You will steal my house?

687
01:26:58,707 --> 01:27:01,731
There is more to steal from me or anyone, right?

688
01:27:02,094 --> 01:27:04,221
Bring my coat, please.

689
01:27:09,975 --> 01:27:12,387
Pasquale, let's get an agreement.

690
01:27:12,445 --> 01:27:15,831
We will talk tomorrow. Teach good manners to it.

691
01:27:16,905 --> 01:27:19,691
For small as well.

692
01:27:19,811 --> 01:27:22,509
- See you later. Good evening. - Goodbye.

693
01:27:30,693 --> 01:27:32,625
Get out of here!

694
01:27:33,821 --> 01:27:37,056
You will not sleep here! Get out immediately!

695
01:27:40,301 --> 01:27:43,079
Hurry up, get out! Skirt!

696
01:27:43,205 --> 01:27:45,389
Get out, walk!

01:27:49,021 --> 01:27:52,114
- Let me in! - Again? Do not come back here!

698
01:27:52,115 --> 01:27:53,877
Get out of here!

699
01:29:34,672 --> 01:29:36,851
Take water.

700
01:30:03,476 --> 01:30:05,447
Where are you going, Pio?

701
01:30:05,643 --> 01:30:08,429
Pio! Where are you going?

702
01:30:54,913 --> 01:30:56,463

703
01:31:00,765 --> 01:31:02,325
Ayiv to!

Ayiv to!

705
01:31:08,862 --> 01:31:11,736
He can not stay here. This house is not appropriate.

706
01:31:11,852 --> 01:31:13,580
It's just for tonight.

707
01:31:16,899 --> 01:31:21,688
- What happened? - Anything. Try to sleep.

708
01:31:21,948 --> 01:31:24,644
About what they are talking?

709
01:31:24,778 --> 01:31:26,534
You can sleep soundly today.

710
01:31:27,334 --> 01:31:31,755
Try to sleep, tomorrow morning call their parents,

711
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:35,156
tell that you are well and will return home.

712
01:31:35,294 --> 01:31:36,630
Beauty.

713
01:31:37,236 --> 01:31:40,458
- You promise? - Promise. Thank you.

714
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,978
What's it?

715
01:32:51,818 --> 01:32:54,598
You want to know about the chain?

716
01:32:56,437 --> 01:33:00,545
In the prison of Palmi, do not let us miss anything.

717
01:33:02,304 --> 01:33:05,116
All there they respect us.

718
01:33:08,203 --> 01:33:09,915
Africans do not.

719
01:33:10,329 --> 01:33:13,109
Africans, no way.

720
01:33:13,999 --> 01:33:16,337
No one even looks at Africans.

721
01:33:16,467 --> 01:33:20,477
But we are respected by all.

722
01:33:20,973 --> 01:33:23,565
Up by the Italians.

723
01:33:26,249 --> 01:33:27,697
In the prison of Palmi,

724
01:33:27,698 --> 01:33:30,716
I had a guy who had been arrested in Brazil.

725
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:36,969
In his cell, they pissed and cagavam on the floor,

726
01:33:36,970 --> 01:33:39,677
if they are holding the bars not to fall in the shit.

727
01:33:42,148 --> 01:33:45,168
Inside they behaved like animals.

728
01:33:50,126 --> 01:33:52,548
You missed, Pio.

729
01:34:03,363 --> 01:34:05,714
What are we going to do now?

730
01:34:06,851 --> 01:34:09,061
Do not know.

731
01:34:09,918 --> 01:34:12,051
You want to do something with me?

732
01:34:14,292 --> 01:34:18,183
Let's do one thing and everything will straighten.

733
01:34:21,675 --> 01:34:23,253
Beauty.

734
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:27,369
- You got it, Pio? - Got it.

735
01:34:54,088 --> 01:34:56,265
- But what do we do? - I told you.

736
01:34:56,266 --> 01:35:00,544
A friend of mine will come with the truck and I will help you.

737
01:35:00,671 --> 01:35:03,420
They give us the money on time.

738
01:35:03,669 --> 01:35:06,328
I will not do that because I know him.

739
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:09,222
Stop getting involved with these Africans!

740
01:35:09,477 --> 01:35:11,337
Why call it African?

741
01:35:11,479 --> 01:35:13,986
We need to think of ourselves

742
01:35:14,036 --> 01:35:15,917
and you care about the African?

743
01:35:16,988 --> 01:35:19,706
No other way, so do not!

744
01:35:19,822 --> 01:35:22,052
Which way? Tell me that way.

745
01:35:22,356 --> 01:35:25,772
Or they'll kick you out, you can not go back to Ciambra.

746
01:35:25,926 --> 01:35:29,598
You need to call him and keep him here.

747
01:35:31,972 --> 01:35:33,690
Let's do it and everything is solved.

748
01:35:33,691 --> 01:35:35,181
I will not do enough!

749
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:37,626
Do not be a child, Pio.

750
01:35:38,879 --> 01:35:41,048
The guy who comes with the truck is my friend.

751
01:35:41,049 --> 01:35:44,123
Let's carry and he pays on time.

752
01:35:46,613 --> 01:35:49,765
Call him! African trusts you.

753
01:36:45,129 --> 01:36:46,875
Why do not you come home?

754
01:36:58,147 --> 01:36:59,949
I like you so much.

755
01:41:58,323 --> 01:41:59,763
What happened to you?

756
01:42:14,939 --> 01:42:16,723
Me tale.

757
01:42:18,793 --> 01:42:20,973
You are scarring me. What happened?

758
01:43:04,511 --> 01:43:06,685
Can you take me home?

759
01:43:34,466 --> 01:43:36,774
Here we go! Let's go!

760
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:41,335
Let's go! Let's go!

761
01:44:44,105 --> 01:44:46,832
Did you see? It's all solved.

762
01:44:48,269 --> 01:44:50,049
What's it?

763
01:44:50,344 --> 01:44:52,143
Pio!

764
01:44:52,238 --> 01:44:54,309
Does it hurt?

765
01:44:57,349 --> 01:44:59,445
You did the right thing.

766
01:45:02,105 --> 01:45:05,149
- Now you became man. - I already am a man.

767
01:45:06,801 --> 01:45:08,188
Really?

768
01:45:08,550 --> 01:45:10,141
You are a man?

769
01:45:11,374 --> 01:45:12,703
Sou.

770
01:45:34,244 --> 01:45:35,649
Wait here.

771
01:45:36,583 --> 01:45:39,242
- Good evening. - Good evening.

772
01:45:42,637 --> 01:45:46,899
I brought my brother he never had sex. Never.

773
01:45:48,099 --> 01:45:50,832
- Who agrees to do the job? - I did.

774
01:45:51,452 --> 01:45:54,473
I do not because I know him.

775
01:45:55,876 --> 01:45:58,680
- So I do. - You? Are you sure?

776
01:45:58,681 --> 01:46:00,104
- Absolute. - I can call him?

777
01:46:00,105 --> 01:46:01,845
- You can. - Beauty.

778
01:46:06,079 --> 01:46:08,889
Go! You see if you are real man.

779
01:46:21,412 --> 01:46:23,227
Come in, boy.

780
01:47:57,141 --> 01:47:59,005
- What did you do here? - I fell.

781
01:47:59,398 --> 01:48:01,609
- Does it hurt? - A little.

782
01:48:02,141 --> 01:48:04,668
But you're well? Are you sure?

783
01:48:05,518 --> 01:48:06,950
You run a lot.

784
01:48:06,951 --> 01:48:09,597
You should not run, but it hurts.

785
01:48:17,393 --> 01:48:20,319
Pio! Come here!

786
01:48:21,773 --> 01:48:23,951
Go Pius.

787
01:48:39,689 --> 01:48:42,045
Come here, Pius!

788
01:48:42,704 --> 01:48:44,157
Come on!
