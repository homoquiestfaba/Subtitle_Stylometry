1
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,598
(crowd cheers)

2
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,793
- Whoa.
- What a wild kickflip wallplant!

3
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,036
It takes me back to my boarding days.

4
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,873
Funny. Cos I feel like
the only boarding you did

5
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,077
was with Charlie and Henry
and the horrid biscuit game.

6
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,878
Oh, OK, yeah, fair point.

7
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,279
The competition has been amazing.
The girls were great.

8
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,796
But the one everyone is talking about,
Kim Matthews, is still missing.

9
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,158
We've actually got some footage of her
as an early skateboarding prodigy.

10
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,356
Kim started competing
when she was seven.

11
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,271
She won the National
Mixed Under-16s

12
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,112
when she was just 11 years old.

13
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,156
I mean, attractive girl even then.

14
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,118
- Really? Because I said 11.
- Yeah, objectively.

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,792
(woman) Two years ago, aged 17,

16
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,154
she won the London Trials.

17
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,232
(man) Mum and Dad supported her

18
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,639
with parental pride

19
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,676
and simplistic homemade signs.

20
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,638
Then nothing. We haven't seen her since.

21
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,676
(woman) There was an accident, Rick.

22
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,558
The car crash, when she lost her mum.

23
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,518
We're thinking of you, Kim.
Wherever you are,

24
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,912
whatever you're doing, we hope
you're riding high and living the dream.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,072
(man on PA) And today's special:
two for one on onion rings.

26
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,559
Onion rings, two for one.

27
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,995
Please don't push.

28
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,118
- (Dad) I thought it was junk mail.
- (Kim) Big red letters.

29
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,668
"Not junk mail."
It says "Urgent Demand" on it.

30
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,150
- They always say that. It's hardly...
- It's nearly a grand.

31
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,593
Dad, you can't just ignore it.

32
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,229
But, hey, we're big hitters, right?
We'll just sell the Bentley.

33
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,518
Oh, no, someone's stolen the Bentley.
Plan B?

34
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,239
They're bluffing.
I'll think of something.

35
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,118
How are you getting on?

36
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,192
No. Nothing yet.

37
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,995
- I'll talk to Les. Sort something out.
- What would I do without you?

38
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,593
Fester.

39
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,792
Hmm!

40
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,034
My rota is... full.

41
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,079
Maybe if you're extra nice to me? Hmm?

42
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,357
Oh, Les, don't be a cock all your life.

43
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,396
(Les on PA) That's your extra nice?

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,677
How did my summer job
become the rest-of-my life job?

45
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,116
A friend of my cousin's
just got into this well-good scam.

46
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:20,036
Catering agencies. Serving champagne
and tiny food to toffs. £12.50 an hour.

47
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:26,119
Hmm. Toffs and champagne
or Les and... Urgh.

48
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,988
I can get the number if you want.
You gotta be posh, though.

49
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,278
Posh? Trace, I can do posh.

50
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,716
- Hi, I'm Arabella.
- I'm Henrietta.

51
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,110
- lsabella.
- Petronella.

52
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,389
Kim.

53
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,153
White wine? Yes.

54
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,798
Red wine?

55
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,871
Yes.

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,036
Dessert wine?

57
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,269
No.

58
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,875
# Is it true what they say
about posh girls?

59
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,596
# Is it true what they say
about posh girls?

60
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,591
(crash)

61
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,079
(Kim) Shit.

62
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,398
You're a lovely girl,
but I'm just not sure.

63
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,710
Let me try. You're just not sure

64
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,155
I'm the right kind of girl
for your clients.

65
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,435
It's hard to say why exactly,

66
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,796
but it's probably to do with the fact
that I'm not called Arabella

67
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,030
or lsabella or anything-bella.

68
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,839
I don't have hundred-quid highlights,
perfect nails

69
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,151
or, I'm just guessing here,
expensively trimmed pubes.

70
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,992
So even though I'm the only person

71
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,356
with actual experience of actual work
in the actual real world,

72
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,116
and you know
I'd try really, really hard,

73
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,112
I'm just not the right kind of girl.

74
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,752
- Is that about the size of it?
- About there, yes.

75
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,958
(Vivaldi's "Four Seasons" ringtone)

76
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,679
This is Bella.

77
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,910
She did what?

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,390
Oh, for God's sake, the silly cow.

79
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,678
Yes, it's the day after tomorrow.
Everyone's booked out.

80
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,077
Wait there,

81
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,789
er,... Kim.

82
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,836
- (Dad) It sounds great.
- I said no.

83
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,115
- What was the job?
- Cooking and cleaning.

84
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,430
Same as I do at work.
Same as I do here.

85
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,592
- Was the pay rubbish?
- No, it's better. Double, plus tips.

86
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,478
But... But still...

87
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,516
But still what?

88
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,149
It's in a ski chalet. In Austria.

89
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,959
For four months.

90
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,749
- Right. Well, I'm sure I could...
- You couldn't.

91
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,753
I'd come home and find a skeleton
on the couch holding the remote.

92
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,353
That's a bit harsh.

93
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,193
- Totally the right decision.
- You think so?

94
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,115
Yeah. What's a luxury chalet with hot,
rich clients in a beautiful ski resort

95
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,668
got on this place? It's a no-brainer.

96
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,548
- Oi, I found this toenail in my...
- Don't even try.

97
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,474
See? Would you get that kind of
quality entertainment in Austria?

98
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,437
I don't think so.

99
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,029
Hi, it's Kim Matthews from yesterday.
I was wondering if you're still...

100
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,998
(Bella) Still desperately seeking
a chalet girl? Yes, I am.

101
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,718
- You are?
- Could you do it?

102
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,076
You have to be there tomorrow.
It's ten hours on the overnight train.

103
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,633
(Kim) Right. I'm making freezer food
to last until April.

104
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,472
You know how the microwave works?

105
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,199
(Dad) It's a magnetron
that converts electricity...

106
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,431
- (Kim) No, no, no. Like on, off?
- (Dad) Yeah, yeah.

107
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,956
What am I doing? I'm packing you off
to some mountainous wasteland,

108
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,349
while I'm stuck here looking for a job.

109
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,079
(Kim) It'll happen,
as long as you keep trying.

110
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,833
- (Dad) But you're only 19.
- (Kim) Exactly! I'm 19.

111
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,717
It's Austria. Hardly a wasteland.

112
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,792
(Dad) Austria. Famous for
"The Sound of Music", breaded food

113
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,633
and the invention of psychoanalysis.
You join the dots.

114
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,553
(Kim) You're such a freak.
No wonder nobody will hire you.

115
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,272
- And you won't forget to have a bath?
- (Dad) Every month.

116
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,396
(Kim) I give up.

117
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,595
And what exactly am l
supposed to do with this?

118
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,989
- What is it?
- You can't live on beans on toast.

119
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,913
We won two world wars
and one World Cup on beans on toast,

120
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,069
so don't knock 'em.

121
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,078
I've set it up online,
so you'll get a delivery every week.

122
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,311
Lexi, this is my health-freak dad, Bill.
Bill, this is Lexi.

123
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,960
I'm trusting you to keep him alive
till I get back, OK?

124
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,190
- (car horn beeps)
- Shit.

125
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,157
My pay goes into the mortgage account.

126
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,390
I'll send any tips back.
Any envelopes...

127
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,631
Big red letters. I know.
Now hurry up, you'll miss your train.

128
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,278
- Maybe this isn't a great idea.
- Go, now.

129
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,312
- I love you, Kimberley.
- I love you, William.

130
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,719
Bye, Dad.

131
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,877
- See you later. Auf Wiedersehen.
- (door shuts)

132
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,876
(yodelling)

133
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,994
Oh, my God, I'm never doing that again!
I can't remember the whole night.

134
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,798
Honestly.

135
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,316
Oh, my God, did you see that guy
staring at my tits the whole night?

136
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,674
It was so awkward.

137
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,753
He was such a perv. And he had a hairy
chest and everything. Can you imagine?

138
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,638
(laughs) Yeah.

139
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,631
Can I call you back, babes?

140
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,558
- Seriously?
- Yep.

141
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,031
OK, let's go. Put your bags
in the back and get in.

142
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,276
Shit.

143
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,553
(Kim) Oh, my God, they're huge.

144
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,997
Yeah, they're mountains.
Huge is part of the concept.

145
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,117
You don't even ski, do you?
What are you doing here?

146
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,877
- It's a job. I need to earn money.
- Earn? What, as in, like, "save"?

147
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,679
(toots horn)

148
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,628
- Oh.
- Thought I recognised that arse.

149
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,235
- Alright, ugly. You coming out?
- Yeah. Just dumping the new girl off.

150
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,630
- The new girl! Let me see.
- Kim, Jules. Jules, Kim.

151
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,870
- Hi.
- Hi.

152
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,309
- I'll see you later, babes.
- See you later, babes.

153
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,557
(Kim) It's a bit poky, isn't it?

154
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,438
So is this guy
head of some evil criminal empire?

155
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,909
- He's a banker.
- That's a yes, then.

156
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,877
- You don't get it, do you?
- Get what?

157
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,916
This is the best job in the Alps.

158
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,470
They use the place to entertain clients
plus a few family weekends.

159
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,955
Apart from that,
they're hardly ever here.

160
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,556
I had 30 girls texting me after Milly
broke her leg, begging me for the job.

161
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,313
But the agency said it had to be
someone they'd seen.

162
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,631
You know what's really funny is,
I wasn't going to take it at first.

163
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,678
OK, maybe not really funny but...

164
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,116
Do what I tell you and if
you're not up to it, I will tell them.

165
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,953
Listen, a week ago I was
mopping up puke in a burger bar.

166
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,558
No, you listen, little Miss Essex
no-coat, non-skiing freak show.

167
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,358
I'm not actually from...

168
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,830
The Madsens fly in at five.
They expect perfection from the start.

169
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,198
Now, if you screw up or, more
importantly, if you make me look bad,

170
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,956
then clearing up puke will be a fond
memory of the good old days. Got it?

171
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,951
Oh!

172
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,228
Got it.

173
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,116
So I'll just make myself at home, then.

174
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,758
# Farmer in my own farm

175
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,593
# In, out and far

176
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,478
# From the high ceilings

177
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,594
(yodelling on TV)

178
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,230
- Look out!
- Hey!

179
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,430
(man shouts / children laugh)

180
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,319
(tuts)

181
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,753
It's a total nightmare.

182
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,519
It's not like you've got to spend
the next four months

183
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,192
sharing a room with her.

184
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,193
- Oh, no, wait, you have.
- I'm serious, babes.

185
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,193
It's like she's never seen snow before.
It's like she's from Africa.

186
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,556
A chalet girl who can't ski.
That's classic.

187
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,349
- Tell me about it. Later, babes.
- Later, babes.

188
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,709
The three golden rules
of chalet-girling.

189
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,836
One, no friends up in the chalet.

190
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,232
Two, party all you like, as long as
breakfast is on the table at eight.

191
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,995
- You oversleep, you pack your bags.
- Friends, breakfast, check.

192
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,435
Three, no sleeping with the clients.

193
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,399
Unless they're fit. Or minted.
Or hitting on you.

194
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,759
- Basically, there's only two rules.
- Basically, yeah.

195
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,629
We're just going to get
the essentials for now.

196
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,631
Right, so shall I go and get the veg?

197
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,837
Six tins of caviar, please. Beluga.

198
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,196
Caviar, right. Of course.

199
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,477
I'm more front-of-house type,
you're more back office.

200
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,278
Because I know how to talk to them.

201
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,352
Yeah, I don't speak much posh.
Dropped it after GCSEs.

202
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,073
- Do you want to prep the veg?
- I live to prep veg.

203
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,549
Right, carrots,
we've got a big game coming up.

204
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,950
I want to see each and every one of you
giving 110 per cent.

205
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,712
Are you done?

206
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,155
Yeah. I thought you said
they landed at five.

207
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,073
I did. But the pilot called.
They ran into some headwind.

208
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,391
Oh, right... The who called?

209
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,875
- (girl) God, he's here already.
- (Kim) Who?

210
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,037
(girl) The owners' all-round ski guide,
fixer and gimp.

211
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,159
Kim, meet the very handsome,
very powerful Bernhardt.

212
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,956
- You're late.
- Did I mention very charming too?

213
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,918
- Is this the new Hausmadchen?
- Hi.

214
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,913
Hey, welcome!

215
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,151
- So, who is everyone?
- Oh, you'll figure it out.

216
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,915
You know, you're going to have to stop
being so helpful all the time.

217
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,557
Rule three. Anyway, he's taken.

218
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,030
- Turned you down, did he?
- No.

219
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,193
So, what's the deal?
How do l, you know, talk to them?

220
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,268
You don't talk to them.
You don't look them directly in the eye.

221
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,518
- And curtsey when you meet them.
- Oh.

222
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,558
- Alright, needle cock?
- You old slapper.

223
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,349
- You OK down there?
- Yeah, yeah, just... stretching.

224
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,796
- Right. Is this the new helper?
- Er, something like that.

225
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,472
Hi, I'm Kim.

226
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,154
Jonny. And I don't actually have
a needle cock.

227
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,789
- He did when he was ten.
- Hey.

228
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,836
I'm so excited to be back! Hi!

229
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,150
- Hey, Chloe.
- How are you?

230
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,834
- This is Milly's replacement, Kate.
- Kim.

231
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,150
This heartbreaker is her brother Nigel.

232
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,438
- Nigel. The famous Nigel.
- He really does have a tiny cock.

233
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,513
Hey, it's not what you got,
it's about where you put it in...

234
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,150
Please ignore him.

235
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,515
This is my dad Richard,
"Call me Dickie."

236
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,999
Are you following this?

237
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,719
- Dad, this is Kim.
- Call me Dickie.

238
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,872
Thank you for stepping in.
Just do whatever Georgie does.

239
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,598
Except that thing with her chin.

240
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,029
- We liked that, didn't we?
- That was a one-off.

241
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,759
- Speaking of one-offs...
- Hey!

242
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,319
Hello.

243
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,834
This is my wife Caroline.

244
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,638
Who apparently has a throat infection.

245
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,392
- Help us with the bags?
- Ah, yes.

246
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,077
- Ahem.
- Give her a chance.

247
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,594
I didn't say anything.

248
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,749
(Georgie) And lovingly topped off
with gravy, a la me.

249
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,317
Back office.

250
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,232
Wouldn't want to steal your thunder
with the sprouts.

251
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,037
Oh, brilliant. Look at that!

252
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,555
(all exclaim)

253
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:56,349
Ibble dibble number one, with 12 ibble
dibbles calls ibble dibble number...

254
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,589
There. Right there.

255
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,671
Mmm! I want to be a profiterole.

256
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,637
So these guys fly in on a private jet

257
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,076
and their idea of fun is rubbing
a burnt cork on each other's faces?

258
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,718
That's insane.

259
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,509
Sanity's overrated.
Tried it once, didn't get it.

260
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,792
Join in. We don't bite.

261
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,395
Well, my mum bites a bit. The rest of us
just nibble ibble dibble...

262
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,913
Talking crap.

263
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,434
- You! It's time.
- No, there's absolutely no way.

264
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,750
- Yes! Yes!
- I don't want to!

265
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,438
Georgie! Georgie! Georgie! Georgie!

266
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,551
OK, OK.

267
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,039
Hark! The Herald.

268
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,309
Ooh.

269
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,598
(makes farting sounds to tune of
"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing")

270
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,874
(mimics beatbox)

271
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,599
- Go, go, go.
- (Chloe) Oh, Nigel.

272
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,999
(Dickie) Yeah, yeah, yeah.

273
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,397
See now, this is my idea of fun.
You should join in.

274
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,318
(all) # Hark! The herald angels sing

275
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,234
Unfortunately I'm only grade one
at... whatever that is.

276
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,038
Yeah!

277
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,669
- You eating alright?
- Five a day. How's it going?

278
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,320
- It's fine.
- What are the people like?

279
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,311
- (excited shrieking)
- They're...

280
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,197
Who wants more champagne?

281
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,872
..fine.

282
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,191
If it doesn't work out, I can
always nick one of their paintings.

283
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,236
- (beeping)
- What's that noise?

284
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,629
Oh, nothing, er...

285
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,474
No, it's next door.
There's a truck reversing,

286
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,118
I think.

287
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,990
Listen, Kimmy,

288
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,593
I really miss you, you know?

289
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,911
I know, Dad. Me too.

290
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,792
(Kim) Georgie? Georgie?

291
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,353
It's seven.

292
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,396
(Georgie groans)

293
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,194
Rule two?

294
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,960
- Is this caviar?
- Sure looks like it.

295
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,830
Well, dig in, everyone,
and enjoy your $300 omelettes.

296
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:31,680
Jesus, Kim. You have to wake me.
I don't need you making me look bad.

297
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,115
- No kidding.
- (shrieks)

298
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,760
So what am I supposed
to do all day, then?

299
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:42,039
I don't know. I'm sure
you'll find something. Look around.

300
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,268
Oh, shit.

301
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,311
Wait! Stop!

302
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,874
- Georgie, this cake is supreme.
- Thank you, Jonny.

303
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,871
(Nigel) Hm-hmm! Sure is.

304
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,878
- This place is so magical.
- It is when you're here.

305
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,997
Enjoy it. You won't ski this much
when you're starting a family.

306
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,197
- Do I get a say in any of this?
- No, snoogles, you don't.

307
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,750
I'm not sure I'm ready for any of this.
Do I look like a grandfather?

308
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,115
- Don't answer that!
- (Chloe laughs)

309
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,914
Thank you. Ooh.

310
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,831
(shrieks)

311
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,399
That's hot!

312
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,389
# Angels watching over me
with smiles upon their face

313
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,429
# Cos I have made it through this far
in an unforgiving place

314
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,036
# It feels sometimes this hill's
too steep for a girl like me to climb

315
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,634
# But I must knock those thoughts
right down

316
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,676
# I'll do it in my own time

317
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,478
# I don 't care

318
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,915
# I'm halfway there

319
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,276
# On a road that leads me
straight to who knows where

320
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,555
(yells)

321
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,588
You crazy freak!
Watch where you're going!

322
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,398
I'm so sorry. Sorry.

323
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,313
Stay safe, Betty Boop.
Hang outside on the ripside!

324
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,916
- Yeah, and in English?
- Hang outside on the ripside.

325
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,389
Ciao!

326
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,670
# I tell you what

327
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,433
# What I have found

328
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,080
# That I'm no fool

329
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,720
# I'm just upside down

330
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,910
# Ain't got no cares

331
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,958
# I ain't got no rules

332
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,429
# I think I like

333
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,159
# Living upside down

334
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,073
# You gotta slow it down

335
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,549
- (yells)
- # But then you pick it up

336
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,950
# Come on and try a little topsy-turvy
back-to-front the right way round

337
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,354
You blow at boarding.
But you sure are styley.

338
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,908
I'll take it you're not
into pink all-in-ones?

339
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,149
(laughs)

340
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,953
- Mikki. Single guy from Finland.
- Kim. Not interested from England.

341
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,913
- You know the skateboarding?
- A bit.

342
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,395
Same, same, but different.
You want some help?

343
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,074
- Yeah.
- OK, come on, get up.

344
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:12,271
OK, in skateboarding, weight back.
In snowboarding, weight centred.

345
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,790
OK. Right.

346
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,518
- Knees.
- OK.

347
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,953
Turn with your shoulders,
not the knees.

348
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,876
You're a natural.

349
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,718
It's like skateboarding, huh?

350
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,114
(Kim) Whoo-hoo!

351
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,553
(laughs)

352
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,679
- That was pretty cool.
- That was nothing, Betty.

353
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,512
Let's get high.

354
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,079
Up.

355
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,317
Oh. No, I can't. I'm on the budget tour.

356
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,914
Betty... Follow me.

357
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,996
Hey, look. That's the biggest
snowboarding competition in Tyrol.

358
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,755
Every year I enter,
every year I face-plant.

359
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,910
But this year I rock it!

360
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,150
Hey, we'll enter together.

361
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,475
Why? Because I'm such a pro boarder?

362
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,676
Three months, maybe.

363
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,399
Maybe, maybe not.

364
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,234
Come on. $25,000. It's easy for you.
You're a skateboarder.

365
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,198
I pulled a 360 my first day on a board.

366
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,392
- (Kim) And broke your neck, right?
- (Mikki) No. My leg.

367
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,394
Just so you know,
I've given Jonny your mother's ring.

368
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,155
That's a coincidence. I've given him
one of her dresses. He'll look lovely.

369
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,879
It is not funny.
The marquee is pencilled for June.

370
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,713
It was quite funny.

371
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,997
Didn't you get the message?
You're joining us. Dress up.

372
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,478
I... did.

373
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,437
Don't worry. She made me change too.

374
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,752
Drainpipe jeans and winkle-pickers
aren't very this season apparently.

375
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,671
(Chloe) You were never a style guru.

376
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,478
(Jonny) I was.

377
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,870
Lippy.

378
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,399
Liner.

379
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,993
Lashes.

380
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,991
Accessories.

381
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,433
I want those back.

382
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,557
And... hair gum. Use sparingly.

383
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,358
Hair gum?

384
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,752
And like that, she became a swan.

385
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,751
So I used to be an ugly duckling, then?

386
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,400
Someone needs to learn
how to take a compliment.

387
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,396
- Ah, it all makes sense now.
- Yeah. I'm just back office.

388
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,872
- It's a shoelace.
- Er, it's bow tie.

389
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,356
No, it's a shoelace knot. Come here.

390
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,436
Didn't think you'd be the kind of girl
who knew how to tie a bow tie.

391
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,432
And here's me thinking
you were the kind of boy who would.

392
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,035
Big night for you, then?

393
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,590
There.

394
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,671
Licensed to kill.

395
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,919
- Or be killed.
- (laughs)

396
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,515
(Jonny) Right, who needs a drink?

397
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,910
- Oh, Georgie. What are these?
- Mini-burgers. Don't blame me.

398
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,713
They are sensational.

399
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,394
- Trying to get me drunk?
- Just helping you on your way.

400
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,357
Greasing your nuts, as it were.

401
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,193
- Rule three?
- Oh, shut up.

402
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,151
What are you grinning at?

403
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,397
Nothing. Just think
I'm starting to get the hang of this.

404
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,314
The cake's on the oven. The beef
is nearly done. And the mousse has set.

405
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,231
Oh, thank you.

406
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,396
Thank you.

407
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,119
- Wow. Did you hear what...
- Yeah, don't get used to it.

408
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,151
Get a fresh one of these.

409
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,708
Such responsibility.
Do I get a performance star?

410
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,791
- What?
- Doesn't matter.

411
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,476
Chloe, you look wonderful.

412
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,111
Oh, look. Looks like the new girl's
putting on pre-dinner entertainment.

413
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,634
Oh, dear, stand back.

414
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,869
Kim, wait. Kim...

415
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,315
(Caroline) What a waste. That's vintage.

416
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,516
Doctor's orders. The good news is,
you've already got the headache,

417
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,318
so you can drink as much as you like.

418
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,789
- I should go and help Georgie.
- I wouldn't worry.

419
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,838
- I think Nigel has her covered.
- Thanks.

420
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:09,151
- Hit the spot.
- Yeah, it should. '62 Dom.

421
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,437
- Dom?
- It's 500 quid a bottle.

422
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,638
500? Think I'll just take the cash
next time.

423
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,228
Why am I here?
I'm stuck in a parallel reality

424
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,039
where people drink my monthly salary
every ten minutes.

425
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,477
You're right. We're aliens.
My mother has a tail. Did you see it?

426
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,755
Your mum is the scariest woman
I've ever met.

427
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,071
You want to know how she met
my dad? Air stewardess. Concorde.

428
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,833
Your dad was an air stewardess?

429
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,628
She's not that scary.

430
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,197
Well, look, I should be getting back.

431
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,592
Yeah, of course. Thanks for the Dom.

432
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,558
Yeah.

433
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,717
(Jonny) Can we talk about this later?

434
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,872
(Caroline)
She won't wait forever, Jonny.

435
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,554
(sighs) I feel so sorry for her.

436
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,433
See?

437
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,872
- Thank you.
- Everything alright?

438
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,549
Yeah, everything's fine.
We'll be back out in February.

439
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,871
See if you can figure out the whole
champagne-bottle thing by then.

440
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,509
- Yep, I will practise daily.
- Knock yourself out.

441
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,678
Trying to shake your hand,
punch you in the stomach. Not cool.

442
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,115
So, I'll put the photos on Facebook.

443
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,230
Well,... poke me.

444
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,149
Right. OK, girls.

445
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,596
This is for all your hard work.
Thank you so much.

446
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,558
And, Kim, you know you get
a lift pass too, don't you?

447
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,031
Just charge it to the chalet.
Unless you'd prefer the cash.

448
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,270
- Lift pass would be great.
- OK.

449
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,158
- Alright, let's go.
- It's a private plane. It can wait.

450
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,874
- It will. I won't.
- Desperate to get back to work.

451
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,679
OK, maybe I'll quit,
and next time we can hitchhike here.

452
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,558
A father-son adventure.
I like the sound of that. Bye.

453
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,714
- "Poke me"?
- Piss off.

454
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,319
Slut.

455
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,234
- 200-euro tip for one week?
- (microwave pings)

456
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,072
Are you sure you're just cooking?

457
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,869
I'll put it in the bank when I can.
You OK?

458
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,392
- Yeah. Solid.
- Huh?

459
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,311
I mean sound, yeah.

460
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,870
- Don't let them work you too hard.
- I won't.

461
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,079
(Kim) Right, Finland, let's do this.
Where do we start?

462
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:55,075
Well, in slopestyle, you are scored
on your tricks on the rails,

463
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,798
and the jump you pull at the end.

464
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,555
- You smell me?
- Yes, I smell you. Unfortunately.

465
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,868
Think about the run. Only the run.
Be the board.

466
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,230
Let's get tricky with Mikki!

467
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,958
(yells)

468
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,389
(whoops)

469
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,556
Right, come on, Kim.

470
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,713
(yells)

471
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,719
(whoops)

472
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,356
Yes! (whoops)

473
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,434
- Hey.
- Hey.

474
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:51,559
You do realise you're riding a beginner
board from, like, the 16th century?

475
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,030
I thought the 16th century
was the golden age of snowboarding.

476
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,873
Go to the rental shop
and pick yourself up a park board.

477
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,030
You'll have more fun on that, trust me.

478
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:04,113
And ask for Willy. Tell him
Tara sent you. He'll hook you up.

479
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,395
Stay safe out there.

480
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,399
Thanks.

481
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,954
Kann ich dir helfen?

482
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,555
Oh, I'm just looking, thanks.

483
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:29,679
Rentals are only 80 euros a week,
and half-price for staff.

484
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,433
Well, I'm staff. And actually,
Tara told me to come by.

485
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,239
OK, fine. 30.

486
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:41,074
Freestyle board, boots and helmet.
You get top end for that.

487
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,991
Cool. Deal.

488
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,349
# For such a long time

489
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,796
# We've been standing in line

490
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,435
# And it's been so long

491
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,832
# That we forgot the reason
we're hanging on

492
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,192
- Georgie!
- Hey!

493
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,511
Check it out! That's your buddy, Kim.

494
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,999
Whoo!

495
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,953
I thought you said she hadn't been
in the mountains before.

496
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,638
She hadn't.

497
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,709
# Far away with me

498
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,711
# You will never know

499
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,593
(Dad) Hey, Kimmy.
I've got my first interview tomorrow.

500
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,958
And, well, I'm being a good boy and
going through the statements, but I saw

501
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,873
that tip money hasn't gone in.
It's probably their fault

502
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,632
but I just thought I'd let you know.

503
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,714
And, hey, Kimmy, aubergines. Whoo!
My new favourite food. Who knew?

504
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,239
Alright, Kimmy, love you.

505
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,198
(alarm clock beeps)

506
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,074
- Didn't hear you get up.
- I haven't.

507
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,598
Level nine! Yeah, baby.

508
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,595
You really think
you're going to win that pro?

509
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,159
N-N-No.

510
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,151
(Bernhardt) Hallo!

511
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,118
Abend. Fraulein.

512
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,272
- Hey, Bernie.
- What's with the towel, Bernie?

513
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,399
My name is Bernhardt. Mr Madsen,
he asked me to test the hot tub.

514
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,630
- Did he now?
- Jawohl.

515
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,957
There is, you must know,
room for more than just one.

516
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,640
That is so funny,

517
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,915
because Kim and I were just saying

518
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,594
how much we would love
to share a hot tub with Bernhardt.

519
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,070
- For sure?
- Yeah.

520
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,436
But the problem is,
we don't have our swimsuits.

521
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,511
Who needs swimsuits?

522
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,993
Yeah, Kim, who needs swimsuits?

523
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,712
You are so right.

524
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,519
Maybe when we're out there
you could give me a back rub.

525
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,592
And then we can, like,
frolic naked in the snow!

526
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,237
Yeah.

527
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:45,079
Ah! I understand.
The famous English humour.

528
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,798
I forget.

529
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,878
(yells)

530
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,473
Stop snowing!

531
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,438
# You cannot change this

532
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,990
# We are not going back

533
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,554
# Yeah

534
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,437
Yes!

535
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,034
(phone beeps)

536
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,037
It's your birthday?

537
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,680
What makes you think that?

538
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,070
You want to look at anything else?
Bank statements, knicker drawer?

539
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,232
- Bertie's. Now.
- I'm can't, I'm saving.

540
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,709
I thought you were
just about to win $25,000.

541
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,995
I don't think you need to save.
Come on.

542
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,592
No, Georgie. I'm not going.

543
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,477
Betty in the house!

544
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,239
You owe me ten euros, G.
She bet me you'd never come in.

545
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,518
She says you were too much of a...
How you say? Chav? What is a chav?

546
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,477
Yeah, Georgie, what is a chav?

547
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,438
I didn't... His English is awful.

548
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,590
Buy yourself some vegetables.

549
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,438
Hey, Willy. This is Kim.

550
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,115
We already met. Tara says
you look sweet on the freestyle.

551
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,316
Do you know who that is?

552
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,960
- Yeah. It's Tara.
- Tara Dakides!

553
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,474
She won, like,
1,000 X Games medals.

554
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,632
First chick in the world
to pull a backside rodeo, right, Willy?

555
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,756
Broke her back
in three places learning it.

556
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,149
Now she needs a painkiller
every time she rides.

557
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,437
- lnsane. What is she doing here?
- The Roxy. Her big comeback.

558
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,238
She reckons this girl has game.

559
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,432
(laughs)
I taught her everything she knows!

560
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,512
- Alright.
- (Georgie) Yeah.

561
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,239
Happy birthday! Blow out your candles!

562
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,271
Whoo-hoo!

563
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,799
(yells)

564
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,718
(rock music)

565
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,670
# Come away with me,
far away with me

566
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,436
# You will never know until you go

567
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,756
# When will you go?

568
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,116
# Fly away with me,
just leave the gravity

569
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,589
# It's all just for show

570
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,238
# When will you go?

571
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,000
# Just let go

572
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,949
# For such a long time

573
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,555
# We've been standing in line

574
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,155
# It's been so long

575
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,471
- It's just a few. Come on.
- But it's rule number one.

576
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,910
The night is young, and so are we.

577
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,310
Just a few.

578
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,436
(loud music)

579
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,840
- This is your fault.
- You are welcome.

580
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,313
Oh, come on!

581
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,958
(yells)

582
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:13,790
- Little Finnish lunatic.
- How long have you been together?

583
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,316
- Oh, we're not together.
- My balls are ice cream!

584
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,789
(girls shriek)

585
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,317
Argh. (laughs nervously)

586
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,675
Chill out.

587
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,917
Chill out, chill out, chill out,

588
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,073
chill out, chill out, chill out,
chill out, chill out, chill out!

589
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,879
(cheers)

590
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:45,354
Chill out, chill out, chill out,
chill out, chill out, chill out!

591
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,954
(others stop chanting)

592
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,634
You here all season?

593
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,756
- Jimmy's going home.
- Don't tempt me.

594
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:26,152
There's a broken coffee table in
the hall, the speaker system is kaput,

595
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,674
and vomit on the yucca plant.

596
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,069
(sighs) Excellent work, girls.

597
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,472
Just as long as nobody painted
a comedy moustache on the...

598
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,397
OK, look, just clean up the mess,
I'll replace the kit,

599
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,080
you pay me back later.
We'll take it out of your tips.

600
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,879
- But what's happened...
- They don't need to know.

601
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,509
I don't understand why they would
do this if they knew we were coming.

602
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,511
- You told them, right?
- Ja, sicher.

603
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,673
Jawohl. I say Mr Jonny come early
because of the good snow.

604
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,637
- No, no, no, he didn't!
- You didn't!

605
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,790
- I did.
- Awesome sauna, bro.

606
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,075
OK, erm... You do not get
to call me needle cock ever again.

607
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,948
And you, next time you have a birthday
party, do it at your own house.

608
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,031
Yeah, yeah, a few rounds of Twister,

609
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,429
a couple of games of gin rummy
and we're away.

610
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,556
- Great.
- Pop round if you're in the area.

611
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,631
- Maybe I will.
- Cool.

612
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,040
Er, breakfast at eight. OK?

613
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,869
Better luck next time, Scheisskopf.

614
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,834
- Kim?
- Georgie?

615
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,435
You're really going to have
to win that competition now.

616
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,354
- Yep.
- (both laugh)

617
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,472
Come on, babes.

618
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,997
First day of the season.

619
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,793
See you later. Try not to organise
any mass raves while we're out.

620
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,795
# I'm not Mr Muscle but I can
be loathsome and I can hustle you

621
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:19,190
# I'm not Mr Muscle but I can
be loathsome and I can hustle you

622
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,114
Look, Dad. I'll speak to you later.
I've really got to go. Love you.

623
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,428
Bye.

624
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,591
Come on.

625
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,112
- Hi.
- Hi.

626
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,875
Hi!

627
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,554
Jesus, have you slept
with half the bloody resort?

628
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,956
- Only the useful half.
- I can be useful.

629
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,993
# I'm not Mr Muscle but I can
be loathsome and I can hustle you

630
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,957
# I'm not Mr Muscle
but I can be loathsome

631
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,918
Is it true chalet girls
all have sex in gondolas?

632
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,594
Oh, yeah. Non-stop.
We are crazy for it.

633
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,318
Come on, can't people see in?

634
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,436
The windows steam up
if you do it right.

635
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:10,479
Yep. On this one you only have
90 seconds. No time for foreplay.

636
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,391
90 seconds is Nige's record.

637
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,552
- I still think I can do better.
- OK, sister present.

638
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,557
- Check out the fresh tracks.
- (Kim) Wow.

639
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,870
- The Yeti.
- The who?

640
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,474
Not really a Yeti.
Just some local mystery guy.

641
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,279
He's always first to put fresh tracks
down the powder.

642
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:31,158
- You know he's a guy because...
- Local mystery person.

643
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,994
He, she, they climb through the night,
ski down at dawn. Pretty amazing.

644
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,350
Amazing / weird.

645
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,877
I'd love to have sex in a gondola.

646
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:54,195
You girls want to come ski with us?
Bernhardt told me about this empty run.

647
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,316
I'm sure they have things
they want to do.

648
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,109
- I'm meeting someone at the snowpark.
- Worried you can't keep up, huh?

649
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,430
- (Georgie scoffs)
- We'll see about that.

650
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,829
(whoops)

651
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,595
(whoops)

652
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,234
(both laugh)

653
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,997
Hey. Over here!

654
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,879
Come on. Your turn to jump.

655
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,512
(car horn blares)

656
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,830
You OK?

657
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,035
Chloe. Chloe, wait!

658
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,758
No, Chloe please don't! Chloe.

659
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,915
(yells / thud)

660
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,629
(yells)

661
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,190
- Does it hurt?
- Of course it fricking hurts, idiot!

662
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,556
OK, give her some more
of that strong stuff. Yeah.

663
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,437
(Chloe yells)

664
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,909
- I feel bad.
- So you should. It's all your fault.

665
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,433
I'm joking. It's really not.

666
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,876
I'll get her back to London
this afternoon. We know a good surgeon.

667
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,474
I'll back out in a couple of weeks
with some clients.

668
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,279
So I'll see you then, then.

669
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,759
Then.

670
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,909
(Chloe yells)

671
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,710
(men shout) Three! Two! One!

672
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,756
(all cheer)

673
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:26,710
- I need help.
- Me too.

674
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,470
Taking big jumps, lesson one.

675
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,393
It's complex, so watch close.

676
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,837
(whoops)

677
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,708
Jump into my arms, Betty!

678
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,429
Betty Boop? You there?

679
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,353
- (breathes heavily)
- Betty?

680
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,556
What's wrong?

681
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,715
Betty, jumping is easy.

682
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,756
Landing is the hard bit.

683
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,512
Come on.

684
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,718
- You ready?
- Yeah.

685
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,756
On three. Three!

686
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,518
(yells)

687
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,477
(both laugh)

688
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,354
(yells)

689
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,477
Yeah!

690
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:03,313
# Chicken! Pay the chicken back back,
pay the chicken back

691
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,517
# Pay back the chicken back,
do the chicken payback

692
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,672
# Piggy! Pay the piggy back back,
pay the piggy back

693
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,911
# Pay back the piggy back,
do the piggy payback

694
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,753
# Monkey! Pay the monkey back back,
pay the monkey back

695
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,832
# See the monkey, do the monkey,
pay the monkey back

696
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,990
Slamdown! Y es!

697
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,717
- My flying angel!
- Ow!

698
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,349
- Are you really going to go for it?
- Yeah. This girl is a podgy.

699
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,910
- She's a what...?
- Podgy. She's a real podgy.

700
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,831
- (phone rings)
- (Kim) I'm not podgy!

701
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,717
Oh, prodigy.

702
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,509
Hey, Nigel, my sexy beast!
How are you?

703
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,749
Nigel?

704
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,308
Hey, Kim! What's up?

705
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,551
Hey. Hey, Tara, erm...

706
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,797
Just... taking a break.

707
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,316
Well, like they say, if it were easy...

708
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,156
You guys ready? Let's go.

709
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,034
Right, come on, buster.

710
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,714
It's been a long day, Betty.
Take it easy.

711
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,349
(Kim) Hey, watch and learn, my friend!

712
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,271
Betty, wait up! It's too soon!

713
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,432
(car horn blares)

714
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,628
(yells)

715
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,433
Whoa!

716
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,358
(chopping)

717
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,915
I think that's enough carrots.

718
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,673
Why give up now
after you've worked so hard?

719
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,753
- Because I don't feel like it, OK?
- It's just a sprain.

720
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,400
This time. Then next time
I break my neck. Then what?

721
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,072
People die doing this stuff.

722
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,037
- I thought you needed the money.
- I do.

723
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,190
Maybe if I hadn't spent it
renting ski kit

724
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,590
and replacing stupid speakers,
which we haven't paid for yet...

725
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:20,468
Jesus, Kim,
we're meant to be having fun.

726
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:32,750
Hello, this is Kim Matthews's phone.
Leave a message after the tone. Bye!

727
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,835
Cheer up, babe. It might never happen.

728
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,310
It has. It continues to.

729
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,153
Do you know what you need to do?

730
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,753
Drink bleach? Good idea.

731
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,195
Two capfuls. Bucket. Hot water.

732
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,114
You know what they say, don't you?
Tidy kitchen, tidy mind.

733
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,310
I just feel like I'm losing her.

734
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,517
People change. Change is good.

735
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,556
Where's her mum, then?

736
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:09,434
Sutton Row Cemetery.
Change isn't always good.

737
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,668
Two capfuls?

738
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:22,392
Yo-ho, snow-ho! (laughs)

739
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:27,237
- How's your arm?
- It's alright. It's getting there.

740
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,311
The doctor said it'll be fine
in a few days.

741
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,437
Oh. Wow, she can talk to me now,
right?

742
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,273
Now that Captain America
isn't calling her 50 times a day.

743
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:39,069
I need my training buddy. They started
building the course for the pro.

744
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:42,118
- You wanna take a sneaky peeky?
- No, I can't.

745
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,794
We've got corporate guests.
Big weekend.

746
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,350
One hour? You've got to do this.

747
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,473
Betty, you on a board,
it's where you're meant to be.

748
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:58,075
You've got so much talent
it's unfair on the rest of us, so why...

749
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,998
Betty...

750
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,349
Sorry, Mikki. I can't.

751
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,794
Bye.

752
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,356
- Thank you, Kate.
- Dad, her name's Kim.

753
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,035
Where's that one from last year, Dickie?
Really big tits, big arse?

754
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,270
Henry Goodwin?
He went bust, didn't you hear?

755
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,828
- You prick! The chalet girl.
- Milly broke her leg.

756
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,990
- What, skiing?
- Apres-skiing.

757
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,436
You're too lean for my taste.
We'll have to fatten you up, love.

758
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,353
Yeah, a bit more cushion
for the pushin'.

759
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,396
- They tip well.
- They'd better.

760
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,232
We need Malcolm to come in first.

761
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,914
40 mill, 50 maybe.
The others will follow.

762
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,150
- You worry too much.
- You don't worry enough.

763
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:54,357
- (Malcolm) Dickie, shift your arse!
- Right. Let's get going.

764
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,908
Georgie, you're coming with us
to dish up lunch?

765
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,077
Erm, actually I've come down
with something.

766
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:04,950
It's like a little tickle.
It's like... (coughs)

767
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,713
Oh. Well, you'd better come,
then, erm...

768
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,030
- Oh, Dad, for God's sake, it's Kim.
- Kim.

769
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,549
No, I should be...

770
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:13,993
Ow.

771
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:19,153
Fine. I'll get changed
and get my lift pass.

772
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,435
You don't need a lift pass.

773
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,795
How can you not need a lift pass?

774
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,115
Ah.

775
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,958
You ever been
in one of these things?

776
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,713
Yeah, we got one at home.
This one's pretty small.

777
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,917
- Do we pay extra for irony?
- No, the irony's free.

778
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,468
- It's the sarcasm you're paying for.
- (laughs)

779
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,198
Ironically.

780
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,959
Oh, wow.

781
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,476
- How long have you been on that thing?
- About eight weeks.

782
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,551
Jesus. Dickie...

783
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,108
You can fly back on the bird
if you're not sure.

784
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:10,789
- She's fine. Trust me.
- I don't want her holding us up.

785
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,398
The global financial meltdown
just happened to other people, right?

786
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:33,234
I warned you about sub-primes. Greed
is only good when it comes to lunch.

787
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,834
Speaking of which, what is this?

788
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:40,675
Special Austrian food.
Strudel, nudel and... knodel.

789
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:44,958
I wouldn't mind a "canoodle"
with this one in fact.

790
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:48,197
Right, nearest the pin, lads.
It's 50s in and it's...

791
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,032
I'm going to go 32C.

792
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,873
It's hard to tell. The jumper
might be bulking her up.

793
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,757
Put me down for a 30B.

794
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,912
Miles off. I'm thinking 30D,
the Holy Grail of bra sizes.

795
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,912
Controversial. Go on, Kimmy,
put us out of our misery.

796
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,797
No, Kim, don't answer that.

797
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,390
I'm sorry. I was under the impression
that we were enjoying ourselves.

798
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:11,075
Unlike most women you know, Malcolm,
Kim keeps her clothes on for a living.

799
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,275
Oh.

800
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,237
It's alright.
You know what they say.

801
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,390
The bigger the chat,
the smaller the chap.

802
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,835
(Dickie laughs)

803
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,388
(Dickie) New game. Waistlines.
Malcolm?

804
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,476
(Malcolm) Fantastic weekend, Dickie.

805
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,790
Flattery will get you nowhere

806
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:33,874
but some fresh powder and a couple of
tasty chalet tarts will get you 40 mill.

807
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:38,271
- Dad, wait.
- Forgotten your hair-care products?

808
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:43,109
Actually, I was thinking about staying
a couple more days if it's OK.

809
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:47,637
Hey, do your thing.
Back for the weekend, obviously?

810
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,551
Yeah, of course.

811
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,918
I'll see you guys soon.

812
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:58,349
There's, like, 400 euros here.
Should think so too. Bloody perverts.

813
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,590
Jonny didn't ask us
to pay him back for...

814
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:03,877
Thanks for reminding me.
(clears throat)

815
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:11,151
- (Georgie laughs)
- Oh, and you. Yes.

816
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:16,954
OK, so that you can earn yours back,
I want to hire you.

817
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,917
50 euros an hour.

818
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,549
Not like that.

819
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,315
- Need a hand? The meter's running.
- No.

820
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,198
That's three euros right there.
Well, it's your money.

821
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,475
Actually, it's mine now. Again.

822
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,592
Show me what's so great
about boarding. Let's get gnarled.

823
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,319
- Gnarly.
- Whatever. Sick, phat, ill.

824
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,038
You sound like a doctor.

825
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:46,030
- Holy shit, I'm a natural.
- Shut up, snoogles.

826
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,511
(Jonny) Move back into position.

827
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:54,273
- (Jonny) Watch this one.
- (Kim) Now concentrate.

828
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,590
- (Jonny) OK.
- ldiot.

829
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:00,673
I think you mean, "Concentrate, please,
valued paying customer."'

830
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:05,071
- (Jonny) Oops.
- Ow!

831
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:10,035
- OK, that was an accident.
- I'm not going to be your bit of fun.

832
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:15,229
- (Kim) Go on, then.
- Yes, yes, yes.

833
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,749
(Kim) Come on, loser.
I'll show you how it's done.

834
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,952
Yes!

835
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,077
(Kim)
So you have a pretty rough life, huh?

836
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,072
- (Jonny) Hideous, isn't it?
- I don't know how you stand it.

837
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,838
It's not all it's cracked up to be.

838
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:39,912
I've heard that having loads of money
can be a real let-down.

839
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,068
You think I could do
anything I want to?

840
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:49,557
Truth is, my dad's been saving a place
for me on the board since I was two

841
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:52,234
and my mother won't be happy
until I've married Chloe

842
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,198
and have nine children
with perfect teeth.

843
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,077
They've got it all planned out for me

844
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:00,038
and I'm, like,
"This is it? This is my life?"

845
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,519
No, nice try, but not quite.

846
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,398
Oh, angst. The rich kid's alternative
to real problems.

847
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:12,553
Sarcasm. The chalet girl's alternative
to real humour. I know I'm lucky...

848
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,716
"But I'm stuck in this caged existence

849
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,030
of vintage champagne
and luxury ski chalets

850
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,111
when I just want to be a pop star."'

851
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,310
Rock star.

852
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,830
- Why don't you just do it, then?
- It's just not that simple.

853
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,198
- What?
- It's nothing.

854
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:38,714
No, what? Go on.

855
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,115
It's just a bit silly.
My mum always used to say,

856
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,516
"You've got brains in your head,
feet in your shoes."'

857
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,512
"You can steer yourself
in any direction you choose."'

858
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,839
Clever girl, your mum.

859
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,316
Yeah. We should get going.

860
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:01,879
(Jonny) Yeah.

861
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,396
(Georgie)
I hope you know what you're doing.

862
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,439
- Excuse me?
- I'm just saying.

863
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:12,433
The season ends, he goes back
to his world, you go back to yours.

864
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:13,788
What are you left with?

865
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:17,714
(scoffs) My world?
Where exactly is that? Pluto?

866
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,917
- No, that's not what I meant.
- Don't judge me by your standards.

867
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,195
You'd rather be with a rich idiot
like Nigel

868
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,999
instead of Mikki
who you are clearly in love with.

869
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:29,709
- I'm going for a beer.
- There's something you need to know.

870
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:33,509
I think I'm done
on the friendly advice for now, thanks.

871
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,956
It'd be better
if you just stay out of it, OK?

872
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,711
Do you want to talk about it?
A barman's cheaper than a shrink.

873
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,631
A beer's cheaper than a barman.

874
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,274
- I'm pretty cheap.
- Beer doesn't talk back either.

875
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,317
(Jonny) Hey. Are you OK?

876
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:19,473
- She told you where I was, then?
- I'm staying out of it.

877
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,071
Look, about us...

878
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:24,999
Night, Jonny.

879
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:30,070
What I really came to say was
I booked the helicopter again.

880
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,070
I need someone to serve me lunch.

881
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:37,672
You are so annoying.

882
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:51,873
# I feel sweet

883
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,315
# Do you feel sweet?

884
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,072
# It's amazing

885
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:03,719
# I have no skin,
and I feel everything

886
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,438
# It's amazing

887
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:11,510
# I've wanted this for so long

888
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,955
# Now the deed has been done

889
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,838
# We shall rise with the sun

890
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:19,150
# Spend our time as one

891
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,834
# Now there is no sin in anything

892
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,672
# It's life-changing

893
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,234
# This feeling

894
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,592
# This feeling

895
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,791
# This feeling

896
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,311
# It's amazing

897
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,878
# From now on

898
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,069
# From now on

899
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,549
# We are one

900
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,710
# It's amazing

901
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,553
# It's in the stars, in the sun

902
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,596
# It's everywhere, in everyone

903
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:23,229
# And it will be every day

904
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,720
# From now on

905
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,637
# From now on

906
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,512
# We are one

907
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:34,039
# It's amazing

908
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:36,031
(Jonny) It's like pass the parcel.

909
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,270
34B. Knew it.

910
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,353
What?

911
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:01,678
Nothing.

912
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:17,196
(Kim) Would it freak you out if I said
that was the best day of my life?

913
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:22,070
OK, maybe not the best,
but certainly top... five.

914
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,919
What is with you people
walking in on me naked?

915
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,515
I think the idea was
you stayed below stairs, young lady.

916
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:35,673
And you, don't you have
an engagement party to go to?

917
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,235
For a second there
I thought she meant...

918
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:43,877
Oh.

919
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,710
- I did try to tell you.
- (Kim) It's not hard.

920
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,836
"Did you hear
Jonny proposed to Chloe?"

921
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,951
"No. Thanks for letting me know, chum."'

922
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,758
I didn't want to see you get hurt.

923
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:09,992
Yeah, you just did a spiffing job
all round, didn't you?

924
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:13,834
She's a chalet girl.
My God, it is such a cliche.

925
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,354
I wouldn't have minded so much
if you were discreet

926
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:19,910
but Bernhardt said you were all over
each other, on the beginner slope!

927
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,310
Bernhardt could learn a few things
about being discreet himself.

928
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:25,868
Honey, do you realise
what you're risking here?

929
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,951
You have to stop this right now,
or I will.

930
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:31,510
This isn't Jane Austen, Mum.
Look, when you and Dad met...

931
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,591
Enough, Jonathan.

932
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:37,157
I just think you can do better.

933
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:39,595
Well, I don't think
Dad could have done better.

934
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,872
Look, your father and l, we got lucky.

935
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:46,952
But believe me,
this girl is only after one thing.

936
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:48,951
Yeah. And it was great.

937
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:52,350
- Is there a reason you're still here?
- Look, Kim, can we just...

938
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:57,070
There's a noise. I can't quite...
Oh, that's right, it's a lying bastard.

939
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:59,515
Yeah. OK.

940
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:03,878
Erm, well, look, I owe you...
three hours.

941
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:06,996
(laughs)

942
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:09,629
Shit.

943
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:13,030
Kim! Kim, wait! Kim!

944
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,358
Kim!

945
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,557
About 8:30 tomorrow.
I'll cook you a nice tea to celebrate.

946
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,234
- What about the competition?
- I was never going to win.

947
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:39,390
It's fine. I can come back
and sort you out.

948
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:42,438
I've lasted three months.
I'm sure I can manage another week.

949
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:45,512
Dad, I looked online
at your latest order. 24 tins of beans?

950
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,391
Are you giving up
the chance of a lifetime

951
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,436
because I'm eating
too many baked beans?

952
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,511
Someone's got to take care of you.

953
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,717
Oh, no, you don't.
Don't you dare do that, Kimmy.

954
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,394
Don't you put this on me.
This is your decision.

955
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:03,109
Anyway, since when did my Kimmy
ever say there was no way

956
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,952
she was gonna win something?

957
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:07,031
I'll tell you something else, Kimberley.

958
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,994
What, William?

959
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,195
It's what she would have wanted.

960
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:18,035
Hallo. Was bekommst du?

961
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,752
Erm, what do you want?

962
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:34,112
It's a beautiful spring morning
here in St Anton,

963
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,794
perfect conditions
for the open qualifiers!

964
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,989
Come on! Come on!

965
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,833
(commentator)..ranks with a kicker.

966
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,596
Mixing things up

967
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:52,875
and finishing off
with a super styley 540

968
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,157
that should see him through
to the weekend's final.

969
01:07:56,240 --> 01:08:00,597
And there it is, a 73!
That sends Hampton through.

970
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:05,356
Next up, from Finland, Mikki Niemenan!

971
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:08,637
- That's you, champ.
- Is Georgie out there?

972
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:12,315
Well, don't think about her.
Think about the run. Only the run.

973
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,470
Be the board.

974
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,872
(start-gate monitor) Go!

975
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:23,631
(commentator) Here he goes,
the Finnish freak now going down,

976
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,915
hammers those rails!

977
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:30,069
Niemenan
showing some impressive skills.

978
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:34,432
Switch 50-50, backside 180.

979
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:38,394
Sweet! Coming up to the booter
where he fell last year.

980
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,755
Hits it, going for broke!

981
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,590
Whoa!

982
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:47,353
And broke it is!

983
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:51,479
He's up, but he's going to have
a monster headache in the morning.

984
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:54,356
- You sure you want this?
- Just do it.

985
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:57,432
And in the ladies' qualifiers now...

986
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,476
Don't worry, it's legal.

987
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,512
- Better than sex too.
-.. Tara Dakides!

988
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:10,071
A solid 50-50 on the goalpost. Boom!

989
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:14,518
She spread some butter on the box!

990
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:18,756
And a frontside seven lean!

991
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,470
A master class from the master!

992
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,835
The Greek goddess!

993
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:28,708
Whatever, man! She is awesome!

994
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,394
The Queen of Scream is back!

995
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:34,199
- Ow!
- Now, last up, strapped in,

996
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:37,909
trying to follow an amazing run,
newcomer Kim Matthews.

997
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,592
Let's see what she has got!

998
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:43,150
Drei, zwei, eins. Go!

999
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:48,751
A front 180 to switch tail, a 180 out!

1000
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:51,515
T extbook awesomeness!

1001
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,433
A silky tail press. Nice one, Matthews!

1002
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:00,311
Throwing an indy grab
coming off the box!

1003
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:05,150
And here she goes now,
coming up to the big booter!

1004
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,673
(car horn blares)

1005
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:12,959
What's happened there?

1006
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,992
She's stopped short
and takes the lame line down.

1007
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:20,798
Kim might have done just enough on the
top section to get into the main event.

1008
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:25,237
Oh, no. 59, just outside qualification.

1009
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:27,470
Kim will be back on finals day,

1010
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,949
but she'll have to wait and see
if she gets a ride.

1011
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:32,600
I came 21st. Yay!

1012
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:34,716
That's great. How many qualify?

1013
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:38,634
The top 20. So, suddenly, not so yay.
I am first reserve though.

1014
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:42,395
- I get a chance if someone pulls out.
- You gave it your best shot though.

1015
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:44,429
(door opens)

1016
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:47,671
- Dad, I've got to go.
- OK, bye.

1017
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:49,318
Bye.

1018
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,829
- (Mikki laughs)
- Finland!

1019
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,911
Morphine rules!

1020
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,639
It's just ligaments, thank God.

1021
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,920
Oh, piss off! Again.

1022
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:06,919
(snoring)

1023
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:18,713
- (Willy) Hi.
- (gasps)

1024
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:25,748
So you are the Yeti.

1025
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:28,399
Must be the hair.

1026
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,552
Want to talk about it?

1027
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:09,235
No.

1028
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,551
It's just something that...

1029
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:26,471
Er...

1030
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,312
We were...

1031
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,960
We were driving home, and, erm...

1032
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,598
I'd just won the London Trials

1033
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:35,353
and... all of us in the car,

1034
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,839
me and my mum and dad,

1035
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:39,115
were singing at the top of our voices

1036
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:42,431
and we were all laughing
cos none of us can sing for shit.

1037
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,476
And, erm...

1038
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,717
Er...

1039
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,189
My dad had to swerve, and...

1040
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:54,190
And he skidded off the road.

1041
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:58,919
And my...

1042
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,319
My mum was on the side
that got hit, and...

1043
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:10,310
And she died.

1044
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:14,196
My mum died.

1045
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,311
I just really miss her.

1046
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,197
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

1047
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,440
I always get like this
when I'm around Yetis.

1048
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,392
Let's ride.

1049
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:54,314
(Willy) I always tell the mountains
my problems. They're good listeners.

1050
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:43,236
Two minutes. I'm going to go
and tell the caterers.

1051
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:50,879
(man) Jonathan!

1052
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:53,190
Deidre and I would like to say...

1053
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,794
Lord and Lady Marberry,
can I get you another drink?

1054
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:58,872
Well, why not? Good to see you.

1055
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:02,117
If you've got to do it, do it now.

1056
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:12,188
He had it the entire time we were there
and I had no idea. Such a surprise.

1057
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:15,033
- Excuse me. Can I have a word?
- Yeah.

1058
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:16,917
Thanks.

1059
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,638
What's up?

1060
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:22,033
What?

1061
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:25,996
- What is it?
- Erm...

1062
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,913
I have an idea
that I wanted to run by you.

1063
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:35,838
How-How would you feel
if we didn't get married?

1064
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,871
How would that sit with you?

1065
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:46,073
- Good idea.
- Really? You're OK with this?

1066
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,396
Of course I'm not OK with it.

1067
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:53,992
- Look, I understand it's bad timing.
- Do you really?

1068
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:57,914
Ending a five-year relationship
in the middle of our engagement party?

1069
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,037
Yes, I think that constitutes
bad timing!

1070
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:02,951
(room falls silent)

1071
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:06,794
- I'm sorry, I'm...
- An asshole is what you are!

1072
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:12,555
Exactly right. I am.

1073
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:18,315
You're in love with her, aren't you?

1074
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:25,717
Exactly right. I am.

1075
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:38,234
Someday I will probably
thank you for this,

1076
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,835
for not going through with it
just to please your mother.

1077
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,831
But today...

1078
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:49,231
(all gasp)

1079
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,637
Today, it's not quite how I'm feeling.

1080
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,237
Here, I got you some ice
for the swelling.

1081
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,556
They're gonna blow up.

1082
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:11,236
Come on, let's go.

1083
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:15,235
- And for your next trick...
- You're not upset?

1084
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:17,629
She's lovely, but I trust you.

1085
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:20,598
- Your mother, on the other hand...
- (wine glass tings)

1086
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:26,396
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the happy couple.

1087
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:28,750
In the unlikely event
of an emergency landing,

1088
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:31,991
the cabin crew will direct you
to the nearest available exit.

1089
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:33,997
It was like love at first sight.

1090
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:37,436
They were kids,
if you can believe that.

1091
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:42,150
(sighs) OK, baby. Let's get you drunk.

1092
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:47,309
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

1093
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,719
Yeah, laters, babe. Yeah.

1094
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,360
Oh, my God!
You guys are never going to believe

1095
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,032
what happened to Jonny and Chloe.

1096
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:56,954
Apparently there was this major
showdown at their engagement party.

1097
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:59,600
Hattie says Chloe dumped Jonny
in front of everyone

1098
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,352
and Jonny stormed out.

1099
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:04,432
But Pips also tweeted that it was
Jonny who broke up with Chloe

1100
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,795
and Chloe just passed out, right there.

1101
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:09,713
Either way,
it was just super-dramatic, right?

1102
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:17,712
What?

1103
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,791
I couldn't care less.

1104
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:28,879
Welcome to Channel 419, broadcasting
live from St Anton, Austria.

1105
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:31,474
Let's go to our girl on the scene,
Jasmine Kendal.

1106
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:34,916
So it's finals day here in St Anton,
and one shot is all they get.

1107
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,956
Come on, y'all. Let's make some noise!

1108
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:41,789
The Roxy Slopestyle Pro! Whoo!

1109
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:46,476
Come on, let this be the best event in
the history of snowboarding! Let's go!

1110
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,676
Whoo!

1111
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:51,320
(man) Good luck, Kim.
I hope you get a ride.

1112
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:54,392
(Kim) Yeah, well, fingers crossed.

1113
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:56,272
Thanks, Gunter.

1114
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,556
Whoa, whoa, this area is reserved.

1115
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,676
- Well, I'm the reserve.
- Oh, yes?

1116
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:05,274
- Your tick here?
- Does it really matter?

1117
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:08,796
- (Willy) You're not listening.
- (Tara) Enough. I'm doing it already.

1118
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,518
Thanks.

1119
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:16,115
(commentator)
20th qualifier, Anja Schmidt!

1120
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:18,919
By my count, nice. That's an 84!

1121
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,798
Bethany Loux, getting high!
She's looking good!

1122
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:26,917
Uh-oh, that bump's gonna cost her.

1123
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:31,471
Halfway through the competition now,
and this thing is still wide open.

1124
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,313
What's this? A front flip! Yes!

1125
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:37,073
Awesome-tacular!

1126
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:44,233
Some major amplitude on that hit! Sick!

1127
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:48,630
Deep in the final stages.
It is getting tense!

1128
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:53,038
Oh. And a super-smooth 720.

1129
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:56,157
That takes Kjersti Buaas
into top spot!

1130
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:01,240
Final three competitors
to the gate, please.

1131
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:06,348
Howson, Beal and... Dakides.

1132
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:09,910
You see, you must have a system
or else everything fails.

1133
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,719
Now, my friend, my work here is done.

1134
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:16,795
- Hey.
- Just wanted to say good luck.

1135
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:18,359
Thanks.

1136
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,155
Hey, you killed it in qualifying,
you know that?

1137
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:26,074
- Up to the point where I screwed up.
- Yeah. Up until then.

1138
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:27,991
(Willy) OK, Tara, it's ready.

1139
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,756
- Well, I'll leave you to it.
- Thanks.

1140
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:37,828
Pretty near perfect yesterday, babe.
What's left to prove?

1141
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:53,798
Hey, Kim. Come back.

1142
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:01,758
- You're riding.
- But no one's dropped out.

1143
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:14,270
Try not to screw up this time, huh?

1144
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:19,309
Hey, clipboard guy. I'm pulling out.
I gave my bib to Kim.

1145
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:29,030
- Last up, lead qualifier...
- Hold on.

1146
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:34,797
Wait... I'm being told that
Tara Dakides has had to pull out.

1147
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:38,919
Her place is being taken
by Kim Matthews from the UK.

1148
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,479
(yells)

1149
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,910
(phone rings)

1150
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:51,952
- Hello?
- (Kim) Channel 419.

1151
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:54,190
I'm on. Now.

1152
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,712
Ready?

1153
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:13,756
# Oh, take these storms away,
start a brand-new story

1154
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:17,230
# I'll make it through each day,
singing death or glory

1155
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,271
- # Lord won't answer me
- Drei...

1156
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:22,352
- # I won't let it bring me down
- Zwei, eins...

1157
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:23,509
Go!

1158
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:27,875
What channel? Now?

1159
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:29,712
Cheers, Bill. Les!

1160
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:35,709
(commentator)
Kim's coming up to the table.

1161
01:23:39,160 --> 01:23:40,275
- Come on.
- # Hold on

1162
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:43,312
# Hold on

1163
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:48,910
On the goalpost,
backside boardslide. Nice!

1164
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:55,829
Yes!

1165
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:59,071
Now what has she saved up for last?

1166
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:17,317
# Hold on, hold on

1167
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:20,676
# Where we belong

1168
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:25,515
# My heart, my song

1169
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,319
# We stand alone

1170
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:31,472
# Where we belong

1171
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:32,834
# Where we belong

1172
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:35,718
(commentator) Switch rodeo 900!

1173
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:38,155
She is so sweet, my teeth hurt!

1174
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:41,829
Y es!

1175
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,750
Hey, whoa! Let's stay professional!

1176
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,718
I'm her agent. All offers to me!

1177
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:58,636
Ow. Ooh. Ow.

1178
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:00,631
You were amazing, Betty.

1179
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:03,276
Pull your chequebooks and follow me.

1180
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:06,033
(Georgie) She's my friend!
I saw her first!

1181
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:08,793
(all shriek)

1182
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:12,952
(Jonny) Congratulations.

1183
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:16,919
So I guess your hourly rate
just shot through the roof.

1184
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,629
Oh, right. It's the lying bastard.

1185
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:25,635
- Technically, I never lied to you.
- Withholding-the-truth bastard.

1186
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:29,595
You hurt me, you know.

1187
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,074
Look...

1188
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:39,352
I'm sorry. I really am.
You know it's over...

1189
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:42,955
Things are gonna have to change
now I'm a global snowboarding megastar.

1190
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:49,272
You're right. You're completely
out of my league.

1191
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:50,952
(Kim) Hm-hmm.

1192
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:55,079
It would be really awkward
if I was always paying for everything.

1193
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:57,196
I could be a kept man.

1194
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,512
(Kim) Come here!

1195
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,228
I've never kissed a girl
in a helmet before.

1196
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:07,952
Safety first.

1197
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:18,079
(Jonny) Oh, God.

1198
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:20,515
We don't have a licence for that stuff!

1199
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,069
Alright.

1200
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:31,071
Kim, come up here and get your prize!

1201
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:37,712
That was so beautiful.

1202
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:43,549
Georgie, from the moment
I laid eyes on you,

1203
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:45,796
I knew that one day
we would be together

1204
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:48,110
and now seeing you here l...

1205
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:52,030
Shitballs.

1206
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:56,272
How about you?
Want to catch a gondola?

1207
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:58,157
- OK.
- Really?

1208
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:05,236
And in first place, winning $25,000,

1209
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:09,717
please welcome to the podium
Kim Matthews!

1210
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,438
(crowd roars)

1211
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:25,356
(commentator) What a future
this girl has ahead of her! Amazing!

1212
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,434
# You say everything's alright

1213
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:59,229
# I say nothing can go right, yeah

1214
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:01,117
# Oh, what a game you can play

1215
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:05,680
# Sad days add to confusion

1216
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:09,469
# Sad ways end in delusion, yeah

1217
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,152
# That's the name of the game

1218
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:15,148
# Well, I know your love is rough

1219
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:17,913
# And the road you take is tough

1220
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,116
# But I just can't get enough

1221
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:21,673
# Chequered love

1222
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:25,469
- Erm...
- I'm trying a bit of the old gourmet.

1223
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:28,154
(laughs)
Oh, yeah? Who's the lucky lady?

1224
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:29,468
You are?

1225
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:33,672
I mean, only if you want to.

1226
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,318
I mean, I only said that

1227
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,231
cos I thought it sounded cool.

1228
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:41,472
- I finish work at six.
- Six is good.

1229
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:44,028
See you at six, then.

1230
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,035
# Well, I know your love is rough

1231
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:50,634
# And the road you take is tough

1232
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:52,790
# But I just can't get enough

1233
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,791
# Chequered love

1234
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:57,070
(presenter) Kim, this is big.

1235
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:01,034
You know, pro snowboarder,
sponsorship deals all over the place.

1236
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:03,793
And you totally rocked up
with some hot guy.

1237
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:07,839
- So that's brilliant.
- He just keeps following me around.

1238
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:11,310
If you want me to take him off your
hands, that is something I could do.

1239
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:14,153
Yeah. We could sort of share him.

1240
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:16,869
# Chequered love

1241
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:24,280
# You say everything's alright

1242
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:27,796
# I say nothing can go right, yeah

1243
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:29,359
# Oh, what a game you can play

1244
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:32,193
- (Jules) Oh! Nigel!
- (Nigel groans)

1245
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,748
(Nigel) Jules, we did it!
It's under 90 seconds!

1246
01:29:34,840 --> 01:29:36,273
(Jules) Well done, babes.

1247
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:40,319
# Oh, I can't let go

1248
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:42,032
# Cos I need you so tonight

1249
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:02,795
Whoo-hoo!

1250
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,029
- Oh.
- (laughter)

1251
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:06,076
# Chequered love

1252
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:09,792
(man) Action.

1253
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:11,950
- This is your fault.
- You are welcome.

1254
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:13,155
(glass smashes)

1255
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:15,549
- Oh.
- (beep)
