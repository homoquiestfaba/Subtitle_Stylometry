For all y'all that ain't ever been there,
you better buckle up...

00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:36,553
...because you're in for a ride.

5
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:40,130
Lots of folks have been curious
about what ever happened...

00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,997
...to the Dukes of old Hazzard County.

7
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,535
First, there's Bo.

8
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:47,572
One day, old Bo was driving to Nashville
to see the Opry...

9
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,675
...but took a wrong turn at Charlotte...

10
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:54,542
...which turned out good because
now he's a racecar driver on the pro circuit.

That's him in that fancy sports car
heading for Hazzard.

12
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:03,422
And Luke Duke was full of plans to
leave Hazzard and set the world on fire.

13
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,491
But instead old Luke's putting out fires...

for the Forestry Service.

to Sheriff Rosco...

...and Rosco's doing his best to maintain
Boss Hogg's high standard of low villainy.
