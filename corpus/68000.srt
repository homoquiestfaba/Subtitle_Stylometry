1
00:02:48,117 --> 00:02:52,486
Carl's Jr. Has this $6 burger,
which really only costs $3.95...

2
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:54,850
...so you think
you're getting some deal...

3
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:58,858
...but the truth is, it may be
the best franchise burger out there.

4
00:02:59,362 --> 00:03:02,695
I went there yesterday
and ordered three.

5
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:06,029
By golly, those suckers
almost filled me up.

6
00:03:06,202 --> 00:03:10,434
When I got home,
I still had to have a box of Eggos...

7
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:13,633
...but that doesn't take away
from Carl's achievement.

8
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,645
I mean, here's a guy who's got
to go through life as Carl Junior, right?

9
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:23,275
Like he can never get out of the shadow
of his dad, the original Carl, I guess.

10
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,620
Do you think this eating has to do
with thinking you killed your mother?

11
00:03:27,824 --> 00:03:30,622
That you're eating yourself
to death as punishment?

12
00:03:31,594 --> 00:03:35,792
- You do think you killed her, right?
- I never said that.

13
00:03:36,266 --> 00:03:39,201
She called out to you
from that big, fancy oak bed.

14
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:42,861
- She said she was having chest pain.
- I never told you any of that!

15
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,338
- How could you know this?
- She begged you to dial 911.

16
00:03:46,576 --> 00:03:50,103
But she was always calling out
for you, wasn't she, Barry?

17
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,840
You weren't there. How could
you know what happened? How?

18
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:02,751
Doesn't matter. What matters is,
you've got to stop blaming yourself.

19
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,918
If you don't, you'll eat yourself
into an early grave for no reason.

20
00:04:07,096 --> 00:04:09,087
You're looking in my head!
Stop it!

21
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,233
- Don't look in there.
- You don't have to do it, Barry.

22
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:13,929
Leave me alone!

23
00:04:16,272 --> 00:04:18,206
It wasn't your fault.

24
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,612
Jonesy?

25
00:05:31,147 --> 00:05:33,377
<i>Hey, how are you doing, Henry?</i>

26
00:05:33,549 --> 00:05:34,948
What's that you say?

27
00:05:35,118 --> 00:05:37,086
<i>Are you going deaf?</i>
<i>How are you doing?</i>

28
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:40,780
You know. SSDD.

29
00:05:40,957 --> 00:05:42,390
<i>Well, yeah, of course.</i>

30
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:47,287
Hey, you know, I was thinking if you were
free this weekend we might go see Duddits.

31
00:05:47,497 --> 00:05:51,024
Yeah, absolutely.
He's been on my mind a lot too.

32
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,191
It's been a long time.

33
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,432
It's open!

34
00:05:57,673 --> 00:06:01,507
I gotta go. I got a thing here.
I'll see you Saturday.

35
00:06:01,677 --> 00:06:02,666
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

36
00:06:13,856 --> 00:06:15,824
See you Saturday.

37
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,585
So, Mr. Defuniak...

38
00:06:20,696 --> 00:06:23,722
...do you know we're both
escapees from Maine?

39
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,101
You're from Pittsfield.

40
00:06:36,045 --> 00:06:40,482
Do you know what happens to scholarship
students caught cheating on exams?

41
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,765
You had the flu that day, didn't you, David?
You didn't take the exam?

42
00:06:58,201 --> 00:07:04,197
You missed the test. And since you were ill,
why not write me an essay instead?

43
00:07:04,373 --> 00:07:07,501
3000 words on the short-term results
of the Norman Conquest.

44
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,474
- Go get started.
- Yes, sir.

45
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:12,113
Better to be from Pittsfield
than go back to it.

46
00:07:12,281 --> 00:07:14,044
Thank you, sir.

47
00:07:18,421 --> 00:07:21,652
How did you know?
You weren't even there that day.

48
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:27,156
Sometimes I just know.

49
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,981
Hello.

50
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:53,618
This probably won't work.

51
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:57,657
Never start that way with a car salesman.
We love challenges. Pete Moore.

52
00:07:58,127 --> 00:08:01,858
In one hour I'm showing a house in
Fryeburg. It's a big commission.

53
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:05,865
And I just lost my damn car keys.
Could you possibly make me duplicates?

54
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:09,198
- That takes at least a day.
- Oh, boy, I just knew it!

55
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:13,167
Easy, Trish. Maybe I can help.
I'm always good at finding things.

56
00:08:13,342 --> 00:08:17,574
- Did I tell you my name? I don't remember...
- I guessed.

57
00:08:20,016 --> 00:08:21,506
Now, let's find those keys.

58
00:08:22,318 --> 00:08:24,752
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hey, Pete.

59
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:28,584
- Miss, I looked again. I couldn't find them.
- Okay. I need your help.

60
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,522
You had the coffee in your hand,
bought aspirin...

61
00:08:31,694 --> 00:08:34,390
...went to your car,
realized the keys were gone.

62
00:08:34,564 --> 00:08:36,191
- That everything?
- Yes.

63
00:08:38,234 --> 00:08:43,365
Look. This is gonna seem weird,
but it's just a thing I do to help me think.

64
00:08:56,686 --> 00:08:59,416
You bought a candy bar
before the aspirin.

65
00:09:04,827 --> 00:09:06,852
Mars bar.

66
00:09:13,436 --> 00:09:14,733
Yours, right?

67
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:25,537
One more question. If I find your keys,
will you let me buy you dinner?

68
00:09:25,715 --> 00:09:27,307
West Wharf? 6:30?

69
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:30,884
Best fried clams in the state?
It's right on your way back.

70
00:09:31,053 --> 00:09:33,351
Sure. Okay.

71
00:09:34,056 --> 00:09:37,423
- That'd be nice.
- All right.

72
00:09:38,628 --> 00:09:41,688
So you got here.
You opened your purse.

73
00:09:41,864 --> 00:09:45,891
Coffee, candy and aspirin,
you're juggling it all around.

74
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:47,626
And that's when...

75
00:09:54,143 --> 00:09:56,043
...you dropped your keys.

76
00:09:57,747 --> 00:09:59,544
It's just luck, is all.

77
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:05,614
Thank you.

78
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:19,590
- West Wharf, right? Half past six?
- You got it.

79
00:10:30,579 --> 00:10:32,604
Another fuckarow.

80
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,884
- Jones.
- <i>How are you doing?</i>

81
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:21,553
- <i>Hey, Beaver. Same shit, different day.</i>
- Same shit, different day.

82
00:11:22,064 --> 00:11:25,932
- Wanna talk?
- No, you're trying to get home.

83
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:30,595
- What's up?
- Really, I got nothing. Go home.

84
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:34,641
- Wait, Jonesy?
- <i>Yeah, Beav?</i>

85
00:11:35,711 --> 00:11:39,772
- You be careful.
- Be careful of what?

86
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,915
Wish I knew.

87
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:17,048
What did you say?

88
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:19,954
I didn't say anything.

89
00:12:20,122 --> 00:12:22,249
Right. Sorry.

90
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:42,471
- Somebody call an ambulance!
- It won't do any good.

91
00:12:42,645 --> 00:12:47,605
I looked away for one second.
Then I heard a thump. What happened?

92
00:12:51,987 --> 00:12:55,354
Oh, my God!
Professor Jones!

93
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:59,460
I just saw him.
He can't die!

94
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:10,438
Clear!

95
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,642
No good. Flatline.
Hit it again!

96
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,277
Clear!

97
00:13:16,445 --> 00:13:20,711
- What do you think?
- I think it's no good. I think he's gone.

98
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,278
Watch out for Ister Gay.

99
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,850
Jonesy, don't try to lift that stuff.

100
00:14:04,026 --> 00:14:09,054
- Just go up to the cabin. I'll get that.
- Here, here, look. Big jacket.

101
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,530
- Beaver, I'm going in!
- All right, I'll see you in a second!

102
00:14:13,469 --> 00:14:15,232
Watch the beer.

103
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:28,780
- Got blown last night.
- Good for you.

104
00:14:29,485 --> 00:14:32,648
- First time?
- Bite my bag.

105
00:14:34,056 --> 00:14:38,049
Met some lady at bingo, went back
to her place, turned into a nice fuckaree.

106
00:14:38,227 --> 00:14:41,594
- As opposed to a fuckarow.
- Obviously.

107
00:14:41,764 --> 00:14:46,133
Though I've had perfectly good fuckarees
turn into fuckarows in a flash.

108
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,634
- Try Viagra.
- Viagra?

109
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,102
I'm practically
at full salute all day.

110
00:14:51,674 --> 00:14:55,110
I'm... What do you call it?
Privatic?

111
00:14:55,678 --> 00:14:58,146
Prag... Prasmatic?
Henry will know.

112
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,442
- You're thinking of fourth grade.
- You're having wood problems?

113
00:15:01,617 --> 00:15:03,744
- You haven't tried it, have you?
- Hell, no!

114
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:09,152
Drop that little blue bomb, you're hard
as a Louisville Slugger for 12 hours.

115
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,050
Twelve hours?

116
00:15:11,226 --> 00:15:14,753
I'm talking Yastrzemski.
You don't have to need it to love it.

117
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,827
Bingo? Did you say bingo,
like the game in church basements?

118
00:15:19,635 --> 00:15:22,103
- There's trim there.
- Beaver!

119
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,303
I thought my deal was pathetic.

120
00:15:31,113 --> 00:15:35,015
- You just watch. That's your job.
- I'm fine.

121
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:40,618
H, you been thinking
about Duddits more than usual?

122
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:45,625
Remember we were gonna
go see him that weekend?

123
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:48,661
- I remember.
- Then I got hit.

124
00:15:54,336 --> 00:15:56,497
I gotta tell you something weird.

125
00:15:56,672 --> 00:16:01,974
The night I got hit, I was standing there
and across the street, I saw Duddits.

126
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:05,973
Just like he was that day
we first saw him back in Derry.

127
00:16:06,148 --> 00:16:09,549
He was calling out for help
and everyone was ignoring him.

128
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:13,051
Then he looked over at me.
He looked directly at me.

129
00:16:13,922 --> 00:16:16,789
And he motioned for me
to come to him.

130
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:27,067
You believe I saw him, don't you?

131
00:16:28,037 --> 00:16:30,062
Yes, sir, I do.

132
00:16:31,874 --> 00:16:35,833
Duddits loves me, I know that.
He loves us all.

133
00:16:39,348 --> 00:16:42,044
He would die before
he'd ever hurt us.

134
00:16:43,485 --> 00:16:46,147
So why was he calling me
into the street to get hit?

135
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,457
Maybe there's more to the story
we don't get yet.

136
00:16:56,198 --> 00:16:57,859
- You don't know shit.
- Name it!

137
00:16:58,033 --> 00:17:01,366
I'll name it after we come up
with a small wager.

138
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:03,061
- 50 bucks.
- What's the subject?

139
00:17:03,238 --> 00:17:06,105
In the movies, when people
wake up together...

140
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,039
...they immediately start kissing
and going at it.

141
00:17:09,211 --> 00:17:13,341
But they never get up first, take a leak
and brush their goddamn teeth.

142
00:17:13,515 --> 00:17:16,541
Which is pretty much necessary
when you wake up.

143
00:17:17,052 --> 00:17:19,714
What's it called when
you got a constant woody?

144
00:17:19,888 --> 00:17:23,051
- You mean priapism.
- See? I'm practically priasmic.

145
00:17:23,225 --> 00:17:24,692
Priapismic.

146
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,795
- Whatever! It's hard.
- That's what you're betting on?

147
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:33,230
No, I can name the one movie where
they acknowledge the scuzzy facts of life.

148
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:37,338
- I'll give you a quarter.
- A quarter from you. 50 bucks from you.

149
00:17:39,374 --> 00:17:42,969
- <i>Promised Land</i>.
- <i>Promised Land</i>? Never heard of it.

150
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:46,112
Meg Ryan and what's his name?
Reefer Sutherland.

151
00:17:46,448 --> 00:17:49,315
- Kiefer.
- From, I don't know,1988 or something?

152
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,943
So Meg Ryan wakes up in the morning
and says, "Where's the cat?"

153
00:17:53,122 --> 00:17:56,751
And he says, "What cat?" And she says,
"The cat that shit in my mouth."

154
00:17:58,694 --> 00:18:00,059
That will be 50 small.

155
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:02,959
- Bullshit! You made it up.
- Could Beaver make that up?

156
00:18:03,132 --> 00:18:06,898
You can have that priceless piece
of cinematic trivia absolutely free.

157
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:11,130
I'm filing that in the "Who-gives-a-shit"
section of my memory warehouse.

158
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,940
- What's the memory warehouse?
- You don't remember?

159
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:18,875
- I must've forgot.
- You forgot?

160
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:22,778
- Just remind me. Don't give me shit.
- It's in his head. We've all got one.

161
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:25,215
- Hasn't that place been condemned?
- Not yet.

162
00:18:25,387 --> 00:18:29,483
It's so crowded I have to throw something
out every time I learn something new.

163
00:18:29,658 --> 00:18:34,152
When I got my new laptop I had to
throw out all my files of rock 'n' roll lyrics.

164
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:42,334
My warehouse was washed away
in a flood about 10 years ago.

165
00:18:42,504 --> 00:18:45,598
I didn't know they had enough beer
in Maine for a flood.

166
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:50,706
Jonesy, if that really
is your name...

167
00:18:52,848 --> 00:18:56,181
...what do you do with the discarded files?
- I burn them.

168
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:39,017
- You threw away the lyrics to "Blue Bayou"?
- No.

169
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:41,523
No, if I really can't
let go of something...

170
00:19:41,697 --> 00:19:44,723
...I sneak it back to an office
where I keep my secret stuff.

171
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,420
Where do you keep
the stuff on Duddits?

172
00:20:05,587 --> 00:20:09,853
He's got a special section all his
own on the third level.

173
00:20:10,058 --> 00:20:13,391
I can't stop thinking about the Duds
lately. How about you guys?

174
00:20:14,062 --> 00:20:17,793
It's this place. He's all around here,
even though he's never been here.

175
00:20:20,502 --> 00:20:24,029
This is our 20th year coming out
here to Hole in the Wall.

176
00:20:24,206 --> 00:20:26,766
And fuck me, Freddy,
here's to 20 more.

177
00:20:28,844 --> 00:20:30,141
Twenty more.

178
00:20:33,081 --> 00:20:34,912
Here's to Duddits...

179
00:20:35,183 --> 00:20:37,048
...our dreamcatcher.

180
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:39,050
Wish he was here.

181
00:20:39,454 --> 00:20:40,682
To the Duds.

182
00:20:40,856 --> 00:20:43,757
- To Douglas Cavell.
- To Duddits.

183
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:55,200
Why is Tina Schlossinger's
pussy on the wall of Tracker Brothers?

184
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,964
Because I said so. It's a picture.

185
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,732
- Have you seen it?
- No...

186
00:20:59,908 --> 00:21:02,638
...but the kid who sits
behind me in shop, he saw it.

187
00:21:02,811 --> 00:21:04,745
Tracker Brothers is deserted.

188
00:21:04,913 --> 00:21:09,043
You don't want to see the homecoming
queen's pussy? Don't come.

189
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,378
Fuck me, Freddy! Some kid's shirt.

190
00:21:13,555 --> 00:21:16,615
- So?
- It's new!

191
00:21:21,163 --> 00:21:23,063
Scooby-Doo.

192
00:21:23,832 --> 00:21:26,232
"I belong to Douglas Cavell."

193
00:21:26,401 --> 00:21:31,703
"If the boy I belong to is lost, please bring
him to 19 Maple Lane, Derry, Maine."

194
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:35,138
Must belong to one of those kids
from the Retard Academy.

195
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:41,542
Come on. Eat it. Eat it.
Eat it and you can go.

196
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,378
Hey, you guys!
Quit it!

197
00:21:43,986 --> 00:21:45,749
Just fucking quit it!

198
00:21:47,322 --> 00:21:48,653
What are you doing?

199
00:21:48,824 --> 00:21:52,089
You're trying to make him eat that?
What's wrong with you?

200
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,286
Got it. I'll make him eat
this dog turd, then he can go.

201
00:21:55,464 --> 00:21:57,989
You go now.
Unless you want half.

202
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,726
Take a hike, girls,
while you have the chance.

203
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:03,336
Piss off.
That's your final warning.

204
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,202
- You better watch it!
- Why is that?

205
00:22:08,777 --> 00:22:11,473
- I know who you are.
- I'm trembling with fear.

206
00:22:11,646 --> 00:22:14,513
- You're Richie Grenadeau, the quarterback!
- So?

207
00:22:14,683 --> 00:22:18,210
What will people say when we tell them
what we caught you doing?

208
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,119
You won't tell anybody anything
because you'll be dead.

209
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,887
- Get ready, Pete.
- Give the word, Henry.

210
00:22:27,062 --> 00:22:30,896
Pete can fly. When you come for us,
all we have to do is get in your way.

211
00:22:31,566 --> 00:22:33,227
I can't catch that little dick?

212
00:22:33,402 --> 00:22:36,803
You know who that is?
That's Pete Moore.

213
00:22:38,006 --> 00:22:41,407
That's right, fat-ass. Pete Moore.
No one can catch him.

214
00:22:41,576 --> 00:22:44,602
He's going straight to his house
to tell his mother.

215
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,044
She'll call the cops
and then we'll see.

216
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:50,044
- You know him, is that it?
- Never saw him.

217
00:22:50,218 --> 00:22:54,848
Then why ask for trouble?
I mean, look at this moron!

218
00:22:55,023 --> 00:22:58,186
- He likes this attention.
- How do you know what he likes?

219
00:23:01,763 --> 00:23:03,128
Come on, you dickweeds!

220
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:07,830
- You want to fight us?
- Yes! Yes!

221
00:23:08,003 --> 00:23:09,868
I'm gone, Henry.
Just say the word.

222
00:23:10,038 --> 00:23:13,872
- Why? You'll lose! Why?
- Because you can't do that! It's wrong!

223
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:16,408
And I'm gonna tell the world!
Tell everybody!

224
00:23:19,381 --> 00:23:22,873
- You want us to leave, is that it?
- No! Let's kick their asses!

225
00:23:30,258 --> 00:23:33,921
Let's go.
We'll get him later. You know that.

226
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:35,996
Get you all later.

227
00:23:46,775 --> 00:23:49,437
It's okay.
You can stop now.

228
00:23:50,245 --> 00:23:51,576
Do something.
Somebody!

229
00:23:53,281 --> 00:23:54,942
If I do...

230
00:23:56,451 --> 00:24:01,787
...and you tell anybody,
I'll never hang with you guys again.

231
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,903
I never knew Beav could sing.

232
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,786
- Beaver, that's beautiful.
- I mean it. Not one word.

233
00:24:35,957 --> 00:24:37,720
Eaver!

234
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:40,018
You've got a fan.

235
00:24:40,662 --> 00:24:41,720
This yours?

236
00:24:56,444 --> 00:24:59,572
Douglas Cavell.
That's your name, right?

237
00:25:01,449 --> 00:25:02,882
I Duddits.

238
00:25:03,051 --> 00:25:06,077
- What?
- I Duddits!

239
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,688
- Duddits?
- Duddits.

240
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,081
Duddits, we got to get you home.

241
00:25:22,671 --> 00:25:25,834
Hey, guys! Come here!
Leave the kid there.

242
00:25:26,508 --> 00:25:29,944
Stand right here, Duddits.
Right here with Scooby, okay?

243
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,232
Jesus Christ bananas!

244
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,062
No way is that
Tina Jean Schlossinger.

245
00:25:55,237 --> 00:25:58,172
Maybe her grandmother.
Good going, Beav.

246
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,537
Holy God. We came all the way
here just for that?

247
00:26:02,277 --> 00:26:06,213
No.
We came for him.

248
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,908
Hey, Pete.
You forgot the dogs.

249
00:26:37,312 --> 00:26:43,774
Weather moving in. Double storm.
Alberta Clipper first, maybe eight inches...

250
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:46,212
...with a nor'easter on its tail.

251
00:26:47,389 --> 00:26:51,792
- Get on back to the cabin, Henry.
- Heading straight there, Mr. G.

252
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,857
- Don't mess around.
- No, sir.

253
00:28:42,737 --> 00:28:44,204
Easy, fella.

254
00:28:44,372 --> 00:28:47,739
Easy. You're okay.
You're all right.

255
00:28:48,243 --> 00:28:50,541
Thank God. Thank God.

256
00:28:50,712 --> 00:28:54,307
Gee, thank God!

257
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:57,974
I'm lost. I've been lost
in the woods since yesterday.

258
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,714
Let's get you inside.
Get you warm.

259
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:06,024
- How would that be?
- Sure.

260
00:29:20,241 --> 00:29:22,175
Here, let me get that.

261
00:29:26,448 --> 00:29:31,715
- Rick McCarthy.
- Gary Jones. But it's Jonesy to everybody.

262
00:29:31,886 --> 00:29:36,550
Our damn cell phones are on the blink now,
so I can't call for help...

263
00:29:36,724 --> 00:29:38,521
...but our car will be back soon.

264
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:43,255
I didn't think I'd make it.
I lost the folks I was with.

265
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:47,066
You saved me, that's for sure.

266
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,032
What's that?

267
00:29:51,473 --> 00:29:53,373
It's a dreamcatcher.

268
00:29:55,677 --> 00:29:58,874
Indian charm.
Catches nightmares...

269
00:29:59,447 --> 00:30:02,382
...keeps them away.
Keeps you safe down here.

270
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,541
I've had enough nightmares.

271
00:30:09,591 --> 00:30:11,320
Been doing that all night.

272
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,451
I ate some berries in the dark.

273
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:19,460
I think they must have upset me.

274
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:45,050
I know what you're thinking.

275
00:30:45,226 --> 00:30:49,526
Anyone who drinks at 11 a.m. Needs
to take the cure, but I only do it here.

276
00:30:50,031 --> 00:30:52,693
In the real world, I never
drink till after 5:00...

277
00:30:52,867 --> 00:30:55,665
...and if it ever does,
I'm on the wagon for life.

278
00:30:56,304 --> 00:30:57,430
Glad to hear it.

279
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:02,499
What's the matter with you?

280
00:31:04,178 --> 00:31:07,670
About six months ago,
the day Jonesy got hit...

281
00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:13,583
...I did something terrible with a patient.
Humiliated him. Drove him out of the office.

282
00:31:13,755 --> 00:31:15,746
Barry Neiman.

283
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:20,354
Couple days ago, I saw his picture
in the paper. He ate himself to death.

284
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:25,455
Mind if I don't use that story
next time I'm trying to sell a Mustang?

285
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,767
Henry, you were a lead balloon long before
this porker munched his way to eternity.

286
00:31:30,939 --> 00:31:35,467
Thanks. You're a real comfort.
You got a real delicate touch to you.

287
00:31:38,413 --> 00:31:42,406
Here you go, Rick, buddy.
That will fix you up.

288
00:31:48,856 --> 00:31:53,156
Jesus Christ bananas!
Some fuckarow this is turning into!

289
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,628
- Thanks a lot, Pete.
- Yeah, I think I got it all.

290
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,631
What happened to you?

291
00:32:03,605 --> 00:32:08,008
Hi. Joe Clarendon.
Call me Beaver.

292
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,269
Rick here had a bad night
in the woods.

293
00:32:10,445 --> 00:32:12,003
Welcome.

294
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,581
- Is that frostbite?
- No, I get the same thing from peanuts.

295
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,842
It's allergy.

296
00:32:19,654 --> 00:32:21,383
Grilled cheese, anyone?

297
00:32:21,556 --> 00:32:26,186
- No, the soup's fine for me, thanks.
- I'll bite. Sail it over here.

298
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:32,029
My mother used to feed me
pea soup when I was feeling...

299
00:32:35,436 --> 00:32:37,336
Bitch in a buzz saw!

300
00:32:37,505 --> 00:32:41,134
I've heard some mighty burps in my time,
but that's the blue ribbon.

301
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:42,571
I am so embarrassed.

302
00:32:42,744 --> 00:32:44,712
Rick ate some berries in the woods.

303
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,279
Oh, my God!

304
00:32:52,654 --> 00:32:54,121
Oh, my God, that's awful!

305
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:55,814
I'm so sorry!

306
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:59,926
Rick, buddy, don't worry about it.
There's more room out than in, anyway.

307
00:33:00,094 --> 00:33:02,961
What have you been eating,
woodchuck turds?

308
00:33:05,867 --> 00:33:07,198
Know what I think?

309
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:11,394
I think you need to lie down
and take you a little nap.

310
00:33:12,306 --> 00:33:14,297
You know, I bet you're right.

311
00:33:14,842 --> 00:33:16,400
I'm just tired, that's all.

312
00:33:17,011 --> 00:33:19,741
- Come on.
- My hat.

313
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:22,480
Beaver?

314
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,178
In here.

315
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:34,392
Thank you for taking me in.
Thank you both.

316
00:33:34,562 --> 00:33:38,430
- Shit, anybody would have.
- Maybe. Maybe not.

317
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,330
All right, this is in case
you have to urk...

318
00:33:41,502 --> 00:33:45,165
...if you can't get to the bathroom,
which is the third door to your left.

319
00:33:45,339 --> 00:33:48,399
If you go in the first,
you'll take a shit in the closet.

320
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,935
If you need anything, we're outside.

321
00:34:05,993 --> 00:34:07,551
Fuck me, give me some air!

322
00:34:07,729 --> 00:34:10,926
We got any gas masks handy?
We need a biohazard team in here.

323
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:16,369
- Wanna hear what will freak you out more?
- Not really.

324
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:18,362
You know his huge stomach?

325
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:22,873
When he got here, his stomach was normal,
but his chest was out to here!

326
00:34:23,044 --> 00:34:24,511
I wish Henry was here.

327
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,374
He's a shrink, not an internist.

328
00:34:26,581 --> 00:34:29,709
He went to med school.
Did you?

329
00:34:31,252 --> 00:34:33,083
I thought about it.

330
00:34:47,435 --> 00:34:49,232
You better get a run at it.

331
00:34:59,247 --> 00:35:00,976
- Shit!
- Watch it!

332
00:35:01,149 --> 00:35:02,343
What the hell?

333
00:35:29,911 --> 00:35:35,349
- Pete, are you okay?
- No, I broke my leg! Man, my damn leg!

334
00:35:35,516 --> 00:35:38,485
Okay. Hang on. Hang on a second.

335
00:35:38,653 --> 00:35:40,883
- I'm caught! I can't...
- God!

336
00:35:48,262 --> 00:35:53,393
- God.
- Henry! A little help here!

337
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,960
Hang on, Pete. Hang on.

338
00:35:56,137 --> 00:35:59,971
- Okay. Here comes the seat belt.
- I just opened that beer.

339
00:36:02,143 --> 00:36:03,770
I got you.

340
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,618
How's your leg?

341
00:36:18,693 --> 00:36:23,392
Well, it ain't broken.
It's just locked up, is all.

342
00:36:43,317 --> 00:36:45,877
You don't suppose
he got exposed to radiation?

343
00:36:46,053 --> 00:36:50,353
I saw that once in a movie.
Guy ended up bald as Telly what's-his-fuck.

344
00:36:50,524 --> 00:36:54,984
This guy's got plenty of hair. But that
red mark got bigger while I was watching it.

345
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:02,493
- What are you doing?
- Peanut butter calms me down.

346
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:07,129
- Somebody else might want to use that jar.
- I'll leave some.

347
00:37:09,176 --> 00:37:10,666
Beav.

348
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,603
Beaver.

349
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,681
Criminettlies!

350
00:37:37,438 --> 00:37:39,338
I think it's a woman.

351
00:37:40,775 --> 00:37:43,676
I ought to warn you.
I'm gonna strangle this broad.

352
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:46,745
- I'd guess she's already dead.
- I'll strangle her anyway.

353
00:37:46,914 --> 00:37:48,973
She almost got us both killed.

354
00:37:50,284 --> 00:37:53,776
Hello! Here we come, ma'am.
Don't be startled.

355
00:38:03,331 --> 00:38:04,889
Hello?

356
00:38:05,766 --> 00:38:09,566
Forget it, H. She's gone.

357
00:38:12,573 --> 00:38:14,200
Hello!

358
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:22,415
Ma'am, can you hear me?
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

359
00:38:25,353 --> 00:38:29,016
I wonder if maybe that's how
they say hello around here.

360
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:33,024
Listen, Miss Road Kill,
you almost got us dead.

361
00:38:34,128 --> 00:38:36,062
Say something.

362
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:40,056
I have to find Rick.

363
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:45,700
- Okay.
- Rick.

364
00:38:50,311 --> 00:38:51,938
Yeah.

365
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:55,781
Fuck me, Freddy.

366
00:39:02,189 --> 00:39:06,125
- What's all that red stuff on their fur?
- Just like McCarthy's cheek.

367
00:39:06,727 --> 00:39:10,754
- I never saw anything like this before.
- Even the bears look scared.

368
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:14,423
- Of what? Where are they going?
- It's not where that worries me...

369
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:17,093
...it's what are they running away from?

370
00:39:25,546 --> 00:39:26,911
What the hell?

371
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,510
This could be perfect.
They can get Stinky to a hospital.

372
00:39:32,686 --> 00:39:33,914
Hey, you guys!

373
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:43,620
- We need some help! Got a sick guy inside!
- <i>This area is under temporary quarantine.</i>

374
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,198
- <i>Stay where you are.</i>
- What quarantine?

375
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:50,770
- We got a sick guy down here!
- We need your help here!

376
00:39:50,938 --> 00:39:53,839
- We got a real sick guy here!
- Take him with you now!

377
00:39:54,408 --> 00:39:59,539
<i>Glad you're okay. This situation</i>
<i>will be resolved in 24 to 48 hours.</i>

378
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:03,744
Kiss my bender!

379
00:40:28,776 --> 00:40:32,337
I gotta ask you, old buddy.
Because I'm confused.

380
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:36,847
- Is this SSDD or not?
- Definitely not.

381
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,678
Different shit today, Pete.

382
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:42,482
And a pretty weird day so far,
if you want to know.

383
00:40:42,656 --> 00:40:44,419
Over here.

384
00:40:49,096 --> 00:40:50,563
There you go.

385
00:40:51,665 --> 00:40:53,257
Easy.

386
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:03,506
It's nine miles to Hole in the Wall.
I think I can manage it.

387
00:41:04,478 --> 00:41:07,003
I'll bring the snowmobile back
and get you both.

388
00:41:07,181 --> 00:41:11,174
Now, Pete, you listen to me.
Don't go back to the car for beer.

389
00:41:11,352 --> 00:41:16,756
- Stay with her. Keep her warm.
- Right hand to God, Dr. D.

390
00:41:17,491 --> 00:41:18,753
Henry!

391
00:41:18,926 --> 00:41:21,190
If we die before you get back...

392
00:41:21,929 --> 00:41:25,228
...promise you'll tell everybody
she wasn't my date.

393
00:41:34,175 --> 00:41:37,269
I'm telling you, Jonesy,
I don't like this at all.

394
00:41:37,444 --> 00:41:41,744
This is turning into a double fuckarow.
A real jobba-nobba.

395
00:42:49,617 --> 00:42:52,711
- Rick, you okay?
- I'm a little sick, fellas.

396
00:42:52,886 --> 00:42:57,016
- I just need to make a little room.
- McCarthy, Rick, open up, man.

397
00:42:57,191 --> 00:42:59,955
- Go away!
- Open the door or we break it down.

398
00:43:00,127 --> 00:43:03,756
- Can't a man have some privacy?
- Rick, where are you bleeding from?

399
00:43:03,931 --> 00:43:07,389
Bleeding? I'm not bleeding.

400
00:43:10,638 --> 00:43:14,039
- Let's do it.
- I'm not positive I wanna go in there.

401
00:43:14,208 --> 00:43:18,304
What if he's dying? Scooby-Dooby-Doo,
we got some work to do now.

402
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,239
On three. Ready?

403
00:43:21,548 --> 00:43:24,984
One... Two...

404
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:28,486
Hold it!
What if we just bounce off?

405
00:43:30,157 --> 00:43:34,093
- No bounce, no play.
- Right. No bounce, no play.

406
00:43:34,795 --> 00:43:36,456
One...

407
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:40,331
And a two... Three!

408
00:43:47,941 --> 00:43:51,001
Oh, fuck! Oh, man!
Fuck!

409
00:43:51,278 --> 00:43:53,746
I don't want to see this!
I can't see this.

410
00:43:53,914 --> 00:43:57,475
- Shut up a minute. Mr. McCarthy? Rick?
- Is he still alive?

411
00:43:57,651 --> 00:44:00,779
I don't know. Rick?
Rick, are you...?

412
00:44:01,422 --> 00:44:05,119
Oh, man! Jonesy, if he can still do that,
he must be alive.

413
00:44:05,292 --> 00:44:07,385
Can you hear me?
I think he's dead.

414
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,859
Bullshit! He dropped a clinker!
I heard it.

415
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:13,591
- I don't think that was a clinker.
- That's enough, snap out of it!

416
00:44:14,435 --> 00:44:16,801
- Oh, my God!
- My God!

417
00:44:20,874 --> 00:44:22,808
- No!
- No?

418
00:44:25,512 --> 00:44:30,006
Good move! It's trapped.
Got nowhere to go but the septic tank.

419
00:44:55,309 --> 00:44:57,072
Oh, shit!

420
00:44:57,644 --> 00:45:01,080
- Listen, Beaver, we're gonna change places.
- What?

421
00:45:01,248 --> 00:45:03,614
- One of us is gonna go to the shed.
- No way!

422
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06,480
Shut up and listen!
There's friction tape there.

423
00:45:06,653 --> 00:45:09,349
You go get it, come back.
We'll tape the lid down.

424
00:45:09,556 --> 00:45:11,717
Then we're gonna get the hell out of here!

425
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:15,357
- You get the tape, Jonesy.
- Don't be brave, Beav.

426
00:45:15,529 --> 00:45:17,895
You're faster than me.
I'll sit on Thumper.

427
00:45:18,065 --> 00:45:21,193
No, if it does get out, you can't fight it.
Not with your hip.

428
00:45:21,702 --> 00:45:24,569
Oh, my God!
Goddamn it! Go!

429
00:45:35,883 --> 00:45:37,714
- And Beav?
- Yeah?

430
00:45:37,951 --> 00:45:39,919
Sit tight, buddy.

431
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:46,149
Okay.

432
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:41,370
All right. Okay.

433
00:46:48,856 --> 00:46:53,725
Shit! Earth to Jonesy!
Come in, Jonesy!

434
00:47:05,772 --> 00:47:09,367
Jonesy. Jonesy.

435
00:47:11,979 --> 00:47:15,039
Calm down now. Okay.

436
00:47:16,517 --> 00:47:17,814
Okay.

437
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:22,081
Okay, here it is. Okay.

438
00:47:27,327 --> 00:47:29,557
Find the damn tape!

439
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,395
Where is it?

440
00:48:48,475 --> 00:48:49,601
Coming, Beav!

441
00:49:06,293 --> 00:49:08,523
Beaver! Beav!

442
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:11,330
I got the... What the...

443
00:49:18,171 --> 00:49:19,570
Jonesy, get out of here!

444
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:21,632
Beaver.

445
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:24,776
- Get out! Shut the door!
- No.

446
00:49:26,513 --> 00:49:27,844
Run, Jonesy.

447
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,065
You killed him.

448
00:50:29,209 --> 00:50:31,700
You killed Beaver.

449
00:50:31,878 --> 00:50:34,403
You killed him, you fuck!

450
00:52:05,138 --> 00:52:07,698
What do you want?

451
00:53:32,859 --> 00:53:36,556
The men call the red stuff Ripley,
after the broad in the <i>Alien</i> movies.

452
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:39,290
We eradicate the animals
as they flee the Blue Zone.

453
00:53:39,432 --> 00:53:40,558
And the populace?

454
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:44,898
We're bringing civilians to Gosselin's.
We'll detain them till we figure this out.

455
00:53:45,071 --> 00:53:50,532
And Owen? This time the ETs belong
to you. That's right, bucko.

456
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:52,803
- You'll be Blue Boy leader.
- Finally.

457
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:55,504
- How many left?
- About a hundred.

458
00:53:55,682 --> 00:53:59,049
Yeah. Not nearly enough
for a serious incursion.

459
00:53:59,219 --> 00:54:01,483
My guess is,
it's a crash-landing.

460
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:05,250
They've never picked terrain like this before.
Or cold weather.

461
00:54:05,425 --> 00:54:06,756
What's your call?

462
00:54:06,927 --> 00:54:10,021
The biggest threat
is them getting out of our net.

463
00:54:10,196 --> 00:54:11,993
Crash-landing or not...

464
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,963
...they'll try to get out
and spread the infection.

465
00:54:16,303 --> 00:54:20,740
I always say they never visited a world
they wouldn't rather own.

466
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,942
They're up to their old tricks.

467
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:26,839
Using a standard grayboy look...

468
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:31,211
...with the innocent doggy eyes
and smooth baby-butt skin.

469
00:54:31,384 --> 00:54:34,251
They project what they think
we want to see.

470
00:54:34,421 --> 00:54:39,051
But I've had a look at the real thing.
You wouldn't want it marrying your sister.

471
00:54:39,659 --> 00:54:45,222
- Difference of opinion about the Ripley.
- Really? Who has an opinion?

472
00:54:45,398 --> 00:54:47,662
- Who do you think?
- General Matheson.

473
00:54:47,834 --> 00:54:51,292
- Three-star General Matheson.
- Three?

474
00:54:51,805 --> 00:54:55,332
- When did you see him?
- They called me in yesterday.

475
00:54:55,508 --> 00:54:58,477
What's the opinion
of those enlightened cocksuckers...

476
00:54:58,611 --> 00:55:00,511
...who've never been near an ET?

477
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:04,707
They say the fungus doesn't take hold in all
victims. Some of them get over it.

478
00:55:05,285 --> 00:55:07,879
Really?
And what about the shit weasels?

479
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:10,386
The ones blasting out the basement door?

480
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:13,549
Does Matheson think
folks get over one of those puppies?

481
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:19,597
Their theory is, they'll only grow in a small
percentage of the exposed population.

482
00:55:20,533 --> 00:55:23,093
Do you like that theory, bucko?

483
00:55:26,606 --> 00:55:28,198
I think it's crap.

484
00:55:28,875 --> 00:55:31,901
So if you thought someone
had been exposed...

485
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:35,878
...and you had them in your grasp...
- I wouldn't want them walking out...

486
00:55:36,049 --> 00:55:42,181
...to wander as they wish.
- Bucko, I think we're on the same page.

487
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:45,183
Pissing in the same latrine.

488
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:50,153
If the Ripley gets out of this
pine-tree paradise...

489
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:53,731
Well, it just can't be allowed to do that.

490
00:55:54,834 --> 00:55:57,826
I've quarantined the entire area.

491
00:55:58,304 --> 00:56:01,637
- Nothing leaves alive.
- Roger that, boss.

492
00:56:02,242 --> 00:56:03,402
Come!

493
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:07,204
Got Maples here, boss.

494
00:56:07,881 --> 00:56:11,715
- Corporal Maples, sir. I mean, boss.
- I know who you are, Maples.

495
00:56:11,885 --> 00:56:16,788
I handpicked every man in Blue Boy group.
Sometimes I wonder about my judgment.

496
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:20,687
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry, boss.
- Do you know the Blue Unit catechism?

497
00:56:20,827 --> 00:56:24,319
- Yes, the B.U.C. For all buckos.
- Is Blue Unit part of regular Army?

498
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,864
- No, boss. Better.
- How does Blue Unit operate?

499
00:56:27,033 --> 00:56:31,561
Under the radar. We do not salute, display
rank, say "sir." A force unto ourselves.

500
00:56:31,704 --> 00:56:33,968
- Regular Army compared to Blue Unit?
- Pussies.

501
00:56:34,107 --> 00:56:37,133
- Under what rules does Blue Unit operate?
- Rules of combat.

502
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:38,800
That's right, laddie.

503
00:56:39,179 --> 00:56:43,013
When a soldier disobeys a superior's orders,
he puts everyone at risk.

504
00:56:43,183 --> 00:56:46,744
And is to be punished immediately
by appropriate command personnel.

505
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,411
That's me. <i>Capisce?</i>
Good.

506
00:56:49,689 --> 00:56:52,817
Now answer me one question
and you can boogie out of here.

507
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:55,620
But you have to answer honestly.

508
00:56:57,363 --> 00:57:02,995
You were on containment detail at 0600
this morning, sector 14 of Blue Zone.

509
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:06,263
Did you allow a young woman
and her 4-year-old daughter...

510
00:57:06,439 --> 00:57:10,535
...to exit the zone in their own vehicle
on Hickam Valley Road?

511
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:13,811
Colonel Curtis, she hadn't been in the zone.

512
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:17,006
She made a wrong turn.
She couldn't have been contaminated.

513
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:20,311
You know this for a fact?
Or because she told you so?

514
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:23,713
- For a fact, boss.
- Scout's honor?

515
00:57:26,257 --> 00:57:31,456
Can you raise your hand and tell me
honestly that you know this for a fact?

516
00:57:36,267 --> 00:57:38,064
Then do it, Maples.

517
00:57:38,469 --> 00:57:41,495
Swear on it.
Scout's honor.

518
00:57:47,712 --> 00:57:49,111
Scout's honor.

519
00:57:52,049 --> 00:57:54,574
Stop your blatting, laddie-buck!

520
00:57:55,553 --> 00:57:57,646
You just avoided a court-martial, boy.

521
00:57:57,822 --> 00:58:00,655
You lie to me again,
you'll be facing a firing squad.

522
00:58:00,825 --> 00:58:04,420
- Get him out before I change my mind.
- Let's get him out of here.

523
00:58:04,795 --> 00:58:06,353
Sentry!

524
00:58:17,074 --> 00:58:19,634
- Jesus, Abe.
- I warned him.

525
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:22,574
Could have gotten off
with a slap on the wrist.

526
00:58:23,114 --> 00:58:26,550
- Instead of taking his whole hand?
- He crossed the Curtis line!

527
00:58:26,917 --> 00:58:29,579
He came into my house, told me lies.

528
00:58:29,987 --> 00:58:32,353
- You think I'm crazy, Owen?
- A little.

529
00:58:36,727 --> 00:58:40,561
I lost my temper there.
But that little worm did something worse.

530
00:58:40,931 --> 00:58:43,331
The pretty mom he let pass this morning?

531
00:58:43,501 --> 00:58:46,868
She's down at the barn right now
crawling with the Ripley.

532
00:58:47,038 --> 00:58:48,699
Twenty-five years, Owen.

533
00:58:48,873 --> 00:58:53,003
Twenty-five years I've been going out
to fight these alien bastards...

534
00:58:53,177 --> 00:58:57,739
...show them they picked the wrong place,
knocked on the wrong fucking door.

535
00:58:57,915 --> 00:59:01,078
And frankly, laddie,
the tank is running a little low.

536
00:59:01,252 --> 00:59:05,746
Luckily for me, there's one bit of good news
in this blizzard of bullshit.

537
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:11,187
I have you. To lead the assault today
and to take over for me tomorrow.

538
00:59:12,096 --> 00:59:15,532
- What are you talking about, Abe?
- It's my last dance, Owen.

539
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:20,103
From now on, you will lead the band.

540
00:59:21,372 --> 00:59:23,704
- You know where I got that?
- John Wayne.

541
00:59:23,908 --> 00:59:28,038
That's right. He gave it to me.
And now I'm giving it to you.

542
00:59:28,245 --> 00:59:33,512
- Abe, I don't know how to...
- Let's not get all girlie with each other.

543
00:59:33,684 --> 00:59:36,915
- Just tell me how we do it.
- We go in fast and hard.

544
00:59:37,088 --> 00:59:38,646
- How do we come out?
- Clean...

545
00:59:38,823 --> 00:59:40,814
...and smiling.

546
00:59:58,843 --> 01:00:01,004
Honey, I'm home.

547
01:00:10,721 --> 01:00:13,986
That's a good idea.
Catch a little shuteye.

548
01:00:14,158 --> 01:00:17,753
Save your energy for those horrendous farts!

549
01:01:26,797 --> 01:01:33,168
Well, it's very nice of you to say so.
I find you very attractive also.

550
01:01:34,572 --> 01:01:38,975
You're one of those rare women who
can handle the full-size Ford Expedition.

551
01:01:39,143 --> 01:01:45,548
The truck that handles like a luxury car.
A really big luxury car.

552
01:01:50,354 --> 01:01:54,688
But seriously, folks,
there is one issue I'd like to bring up...

553
01:01:54,859 --> 01:01:58,795
...just in case I should, you know,
kick the bucket out here...

554
01:01:58,963 --> 01:02:05,027
...turn into a goddamn Petesicle.
Not that I think that's inevitable.

555
01:02:05,202 --> 01:02:09,639
I'm sure Henry or Jonesy or Beaver
will be coming to get us soon.

556
01:02:10,574 --> 01:02:13,668
They're my friends.
We're all best friends.

557
01:02:15,846 --> 01:02:19,577
Now, ma'am,
I'll be very candid with you about this...

558
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:24,551
...so please, don't get freaked out
or think that I'm some kind of weirdo...

559
01:02:24,722 --> 01:02:27,782
...who you shouldn't meet
for the best fried clams in Maine.

560
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:31,519
Just some innocent fried clams
at the West Wharf!

561
01:02:33,297 --> 01:02:35,458
You see, the four of us,
best friends...

562
01:02:35,633 --> 01:02:38,898
...we all have this other friend
by the name of Duddits.

563
01:02:39,069 --> 01:02:43,597
And our friend Duddits, well,
he's not your average old buddy.

564
01:02:44,642 --> 01:02:50,512
One day, a long time ago,
he gave us all this kind of gift.

565
01:02:50,681 --> 01:02:54,173
It's this... How shall I put it?

566
01:02:54,785 --> 01:03:00,246
This ability.
This ability to know things...

567
01:03:00,424 --> 01:03:04,690
...to talk to each other without talking
at all, just mind-to-mind.

568
01:03:04,862 --> 01:03:07,524
Do you see what I'm getting at?

569
01:03:14,438 --> 01:03:16,303
I knew you would.

570
01:03:17,608 --> 01:03:20,406
Lately, I've been having this dream...

571
01:03:20,577 --> 01:03:26,538
...and in the dream, I understand
how Duddits could give us a gift like that.

572
01:03:27,751 --> 01:03:30,652
I think maybe our friend Duds
is not from this planet.

573
01:03:30,821 --> 01:03:33,255
I think Duddits is from somewhere else...

574
01:03:33,424 --> 01:03:38,885
...and he came here
to prepare us for something.

575
01:03:43,233 --> 01:03:44,860
It's crazy.

576
01:03:45,936 --> 01:03:49,463
Talking shit about the only perfect person
I ever knew.

577
01:03:50,474 --> 01:03:55,537
He's so goddamned good.
I can't believe he's a human.

578
01:03:57,181 --> 01:04:01,174
I should be singing his praises,
not questioning what galaxy he's...

579
01:04:01,352 --> 01:04:02,910
I gotta pee.

580
01:04:06,824 --> 01:04:08,018
That's what I should be doing.

581
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:21,397
Here's to you, Duds.

582
01:04:23,007 --> 01:04:25,202
The highest civilian decoration.

583
01:04:36,653 --> 01:04:38,553
Lord, I will never drink again.

584
01:05:41,151 --> 01:05:42,641
Let me get this straight.

585
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:47,848
Yesterday you want to call it quits,
throw in the towel, pull the plug, curtains.

586
01:05:48,025 --> 01:05:53,657
Today, you're begging, praying.
Couple more hours. Couple more miles.

587
01:05:53,831 --> 01:05:55,958
Make up your mind.

588
01:05:57,701 --> 01:06:00,534
Jonesy!
Way to go, motherfucker!

589
01:06:00,704 --> 01:06:02,467
Here you come to save the day!

590
01:06:06,944 --> 01:06:08,343
What the hell?

591
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:12,039
Who's Mr. Gray?

592
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:15,650
What are you trying to tell me, Jonesy?

593
01:06:17,788 --> 01:06:19,722
You're not Jonesy.

594
01:06:57,227 --> 01:07:00,355
What was that, Mr. Jones?
What did we just pass on the road?

595
01:07:00,964 --> 01:07:05,628
- <i>Are you speaking to me?</i>
- Yes, I am, Mr. Jones. Or is it Jonesy?

596
01:07:05,802 --> 01:07:09,738
That's what your friends call you, isn't it?
Let's be friends.

597
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:13,199
- <i>Why are you letting me live?</i>
- I'm borrowing you.

598
01:07:13,377 --> 01:07:18,508
- We're going to take a little journey.
- <i>Beaver never hurt a soul and you killed him.</i>

599
01:07:18,749 --> 01:07:22,515
He had nothing in his head.
I've found something useful in yours.

600
01:07:22,886 --> 01:07:25,946
- Fuck you!
- I know what that expression means.

601
01:07:26,123 --> 01:07:29,456
I've studied the foul language section
of your memory warehouse.

602
01:07:29,626 --> 01:07:34,928
- Rather distasteful, I must say.
- How about this, Mr. Gray? Eat shit and die.

603
01:07:38,168 --> 01:07:40,432
Why did you call me Mr. Gray?

604
01:07:40,604 --> 01:07:43,539
Watch out for Ister Gay.

605
01:07:44,107 --> 01:07:47,907
Someone told you about me.
Who told you about me?

606
01:07:48,145 --> 01:07:50,579
If you want to know,
why don't you read my mind?

607
01:07:50,881 --> 01:07:53,611
Surprisingly,
you're able to keep things from me...

608
01:07:53,784 --> 01:07:56,981
...I don't understand it.
But I'm sure I'll figure it out soon.

609
01:08:17,941 --> 01:08:19,636
Oh, Pete, Jesus!

610
01:08:19,810 --> 01:08:22,438
Motherfucker tried to bite my dick off,
Jonesy.

611
01:08:22,613 --> 01:08:25,138
I always thought it would be my ex-wife
did that.

612
01:08:26,316 --> 01:08:28,546
Let's get you to some help.

613
01:08:30,954 --> 01:08:33,286
Can you still see the line, buddy?

614
01:08:34,091 --> 01:08:38,790
- I don't need the line to get to Gosselin's.
- No, I know that, but...

615
01:08:38,962 --> 01:08:43,228
...if we didn't want to go to Gosselin's,
how would you get us out to 95?

616
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:47,700
95? Who gives a shit?
I'm hurting here, Jonesy.

617
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:52,167
What's wrong with you?

618
01:08:55,012 --> 01:08:57,446
- Wait a minute, you're not...
- Shut up, Pete.

619
01:08:57,614 --> 01:08:59,980
You're too messed up
to know what you're saying.

620
01:09:00,150 --> 01:09:04,610
Too late for that. Pete, I need you
to get onto the snowmobile right now.

621
01:09:04,855 --> 01:09:08,313
Who the fuck are you?
You sound like one of those James Bonds!

622
01:09:08,492 --> 01:09:11,984
This has to do with the fucking eel,
doesn't it? You're not...

623
01:09:17,634 --> 01:09:21,627
Stop it! I'll get him to help.
Pete, tell him what he wants to know.

624
01:09:31,581 --> 01:09:36,678
Now, Pete, which way to l-95?
I need to go to Massachusetts.

625
01:09:57,941 --> 01:10:01,138
My, my. That is a gift.

626
01:10:01,978 --> 01:10:03,707
Who taught you that?

627
01:10:09,186 --> 01:10:11,416
You're gonna be a big help, Pete.

628
01:10:13,957 --> 01:10:15,686
Climb aboard.

629
01:10:32,075 --> 01:10:35,135
- Show's over out there, buddy. Let me in.
- <i>Let me in.</i>

630
01:10:35,312 --> 01:10:38,873
What have you got
in that part of your mind, professor?

631
01:10:39,049 --> 01:10:42,610
Your memories are out here
in the warehouse, aren't they?

632
01:10:42,786 --> 01:10:46,745
I want to know who warned you about me.
And who taught Pete that nifty trick?

633
01:10:46,923 --> 01:10:50,450
I'm sure the answers are here.
It'll just take me a while to find them.

634
01:10:50,627 --> 01:10:52,618
- <i>To find them.</i>
- Think about letting me in.

635
01:10:52,796 --> 01:10:55,788
- It's the polite thing to do.
- <i>Polite thing to do.</i>

636
01:11:59,396 --> 01:12:01,227
Beav!

637
01:12:36,099 --> 01:12:37,726
What is this?

638
01:13:07,998 --> 01:13:09,431
Beav.

639
01:13:10,534 --> 01:13:12,297
Shit!

640
01:13:16,573 --> 01:13:18,700
Fuck me, Freddy.

641
01:14:32,382 --> 01:14:34,213
Asshole!

642
01:16:51,221 --> 01:16:54,657
So long, Beav. Love you, man.

643
01:17:10,774 --> 01:17:12,241
We all made them in art.

644
01:17:12,408 --> 01:17:14,603
I finished first, so I made one for you, Duds.

645
01:17:14,778 --> 01:17:17,679
Mine's deformed.
I couldn't figure out the string.

646
01:17:18,748 --> 01:17:24,186
- Eaver, Henny, Ownzy, Eet!
- That's right, my man.

647
01:17:24,921 --> 01:17:26,479
I Duddits.

648
01:17:27,257 --> 01:17:30,124
- Yes. I Duddits.
- I Duddits!

649
01:17:31,127 --> 01:17:33,527
I Duddits!

650
01:17:36,099 --> 01:17:38,158
- Duds will find her.
- How?

651
01:17:38,334 --> 01:17:41,064
- He can do anything.
- She's from the Retard Academy.

652
01:17:41,237 --> 01:17:44,331
- She always waves.
- We've gotta save this girl.

653
01:17:47,010 --> 01:17:50,343
- Save this world?
- Not the world, Duds. A girl.

654
01:17:50,513 --> 01:17:53,380
- We'll save the world some other time.
- Ister Gay?

655
01:17:53,550 --> 01:17:55,916
- Yeah, it's a mystery.
- We need you to solve it.

656
01:17:56,085 --> 01:17:58,576
- Dreamcatcher. Duds'll read our minds.
- Not this again.

657
01:17:58,755 --> 01:18:00,620
- Shut up.
- We gotta think of Josie.

658
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:03,020
Josie, Josie, Josie.

659
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:07,090
"Josie Rinkenhauer."

660
01:19:02,452 --> 01:19:06,149
- Josie?
- That's right. Can you find Josie?

661
01:19:47,697 --> 01:19:50,495
- <i>This is completely crazy.</i>
- You can say that again.

662
01:19:50,667 --> 01:19:53,067
- I didn't say anything.
- <i>You did. I heard you.</i>

663
01:19:53,236 --> 01:19:57,502
- <i>You said, "This is completely crazy."</i>
- I didn't say that.

664
01:19:58,441 --> 01:20:00,432
I thought it.

665
01:20:01,377 --> 01:20:06,610
Kiss my bender.
Duds can hear people's thoughts. We can't.

666
01:20:06,950 --> 01:20:08,508
<i>Are you sure of that, Beav?</i>

667
01:20:53,930 --> 01:20:56,990
Hey, guys! She's down here for sure!

668
01:21:09,379 --> 01:21:10,903
Josie, you down there?

669
01:21:12,281 --> 01:21:15,546
Josie! Josie!

670
01:21:18,087 --> 01:21:20,351
Fuck me, Freddy, she's down there.

671
01:21:20,523 --> 01:21:24,323
I know it. I can see her in my head.

672
01:21:24,494 --> 01:21:27,190
- Yeah.
- Me too.

673
01:21:27,764 --> 01:21:30,927
Help! Please!

674
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:34,592
- Help me.
- Hold on, Josie, we're coming!

675
01:21:34,771 --> 01:21:37,137
Josie, hang in there!

676
01:21:42,979 --> 01:21:44,844
Don't sing.
She's scared enough.

677
01:21:45,014 --> 01:21:49,747
- Shut up. There's like rat shit in here.
- Hold on to my feet!

678
01:21:50,286 --> 01:21:52,151
Pete, do you see anything?

679
01:21:53,056 --> 01:21:58,255
- Duds! We got her!
- Here's Josie.

680
01:22:31,594 --> 01:22:34,358
Blue Boy leader.
How we doing, bucko?

681
01:22:35,531 --> 01:22:40,798
- Right here, boss. Fast and hard.
- Wouldn't have it any other way, Blue Boy.

682
01:22:42,505 --> 01:22:44,132
Sir?

683
01:22:46,509 --> 01:22:48,306
I see it.

684
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:02,814
- <i>Don't hurt us.</i>
- <i>We're dying.</i>

685
01:23:02,992 --> 01:23:05,517
- <i>There is no infection here.</i>
- Whose radio is that?

686
01:23:05,728 --> 01:23:08,629
It's not the radio.
They're putting it into our heads.

687
01:23:08,865 --> 01:23:11,026
- <i>We are helpless.</i>
- There it is, gentlemen.

688
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:14,533
- <i>There's no infection here.</i>
- Directly into our heads.

689
01:23:14,837 --> 01:23:17,305
This gives you an idea
what we're up against.

690
01:23:19,308 --> 01:23:22,368
If anybody's thinking,
"Those poor, helpless little folk...

691
01:23:22,545 --> 01:23:26,641
...all naked and unarmed beside
their crashed intergalactic Winnebago...

692
01:23:26,816 --> 01:23:29,808
...what kind of a dog,
what kind of a monster...

693
01:23:29,986 --> 01:23:32,750
...could hear that heartbreak
and go in just the same?"

694
01:23:32,922 --> 01:23:38,019
- Well, I'm that dog. I'm that monster.
- <i>We are helpless. We are dying.</i>

695
01:23:38,194 --> 01:23:41,027
These mothers are as harmless
as a fox in a henhouse.

696
01:23:41,197 --> 01:23:44,064
And I'm here to kick some ass!
Are you with me?

697
01:23:44,233 --> 01:23:46,030
- Yes, boss!
- Roger that, boss.

698
01:23:46,269 --> 01:23:47,429
Right on, boss.

699
01:23:48,504 --> 01:23:50,597
<i>Don't hurt us.</i>

700
01:23:55,011 --> 01:23:56,808
I have a visual.

701
01:23:59,849 --> 01:24:01,612
<i>Holy shit!</i>

702
01:24:01,784 --> 01:24:03,718
<i>Damn, look at the size of that.</i>

703
01:24:05,188 --> 01:24:09,784
<i>Blue Boy group, this is Blue Boy leader.</i>
<i>Target imminent. Move to level 4 readiness.</i>

704
01:24:09,959 --> 01:24:12,120
Gentlemen, lock and load.

705
01:24:14,063 --> 01:24:15,394
Hellfires are hot.

706
01:24:17,099 --> 01:24:18,361
Sing it out, Owen!

707
01:24:18,868 --> 01:24:24,431
Blue Boy group, this is Blue Boy leader.
Clean up the forest and get rid of this trash!

708
01:24:24,607 --> 01:24:27,201
- Don't hurt us.
- Please, don't hurt us.

709
01:24:27,376 --> 01:24:30,436
- There is no infection here.
- We are helpless.

710
01:24:30,746 --> 01:24:33,214
- Fire at will!
- Fire!

711
01:25:46,489 --> 01:25:48,480
<i>Owen, get them out of there!</i>

712
01:25:49,692 --> 01:25:50,989
<i>It's gonna blow!</i>

713
01:25:51,494 --> 01:25:55,157
Blue Boy group, withdraw at once.
I repeat, cease firing and back off!

714
01:25:55,331 --> 01:25:57,697
- We can get them!
- <i>It's self-destructing. Back off!</i>

715
01:25:58,100 --> 01:26:00,933
- Blue Boy group, get out of there!
- We're on top of it!

716
01:26:01,837 --> 01:26:03,737
<i>Owen, pull out now!</i>

717
01:26:03,906 --> 01:26:07,239
- <i>Pull out! Get out of there!</i>
- Pull out!

718
01:26:34,003 --> 01:26:39,066
Jonesy, I've been thinking about our friend.
Our Scooby-Doo buddy.

719
01:26:39,675 --> 01:26:43,406
For a long time I thought he was sent to us
to warn us about something.

720
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:46,648
- I could never figure what it was.
- Don't talk about him.

721
01:26:46,816 --> 01:26:51,048
Not till today.
It was this, right now.

722
01:26:51,787 --> 01:26:57,089
- He wanted to warn us.
- Go ahead, Pete. Tell me about your friend.

723
01:26:57,259 --> 01:27:02,219
- Did he show you that nifty trick?
- No. Jonesy's right.

724
01:27:02,665 --> 01:27:06,761
- Come on, Pete. Let's talk.
- Bite my bag, motherfucker!

725
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:15,906
All right, Pete, I'll bite.
Your bag and everything else.

726
01:27:19,849 --> 01:27:23,012
No, no! You bastard! No!

727
01:27:31,961 --> 01:27:33,895
Pete.

728
01:28:22,878 --> 01:28:25,210
Don't talk to him!
Get out of there!

729
01:28:29,585 --> 01:28:32,179
- What's up?
- Thank God you came by, governor.

730
01:28:32,488 --> 01:28:35,082
I'm broke down here and fearing for my life.

731
01:28:35,758 --> 01:28:37,385
That's a good-looking dog.

732
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:39,619
- Where you headed?
- Gosselin's.

733
01:28:39,795 --> 01:28:42,389
Any chance you're going near there?

734
01:28:42,865 --> 01:28:44,594
That's where I'm going.

735
01:28:45,501 --> 01:28:49,198
Well, I believe your tailgate has come open.

736
01:28:55,678 --> 01:28:57,407
Let's take a look.

737
01:29:05,087 --> 01:29:08,181
I see you have some cargo
you're taking to Blue Base.

738
01:29:32,081 --> 01:29:34,447
Got a treat for you, lke.

739
01:29:37,386 --> 01:29:42,016
All you can eat.
Eat all the red stuff.

740
01:29:43,692 --> 01:29:49,426
Good doggy. Yes.
Good boy.

741
01:29:50,032 --> 01:29:54,298
Have your fill.
Tasty, tasty.

742
01:29:54,470 --> 01:29:56,529
Eat all you want...

743
01:29:59,508 --> 01:30:04,138
Jonesy.
What are you up to?

744
01:30:39,448 --> 01:30:40,847
<i>Jonesy!</i>

745
01:31:01,870 --> 01:31:03,599
Oh, God!

746
01:31:55,958 --> 01:32:00,054
Halt or we'll fire!
You cannot leave the quarantine zone!

747
01:32:00,229 --> 01:32:02,356
- Halt!
- I think I just about halted here.

748
01:32:08,003 --> 01:32:09,527
Come with me, Owen.

749
01:32:09,705 --> 01:32:12,731
I'll show you things
you'll wish you'd never seen.

750
01:32:27,956 --> 01:32:30,686
- How long we gotta be here?
- It'll be all right.

751
01:32:35,264 --> 01:32:38,859
- I demand to see my lawyer!
- There must be something they can do.

752
01:32:41,170 --> 01:32:42,933
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

753
01:32:43,138 --> 01:32:45,231
- When do we get out?
- Within hours.

754
01:32:45,407 --> 01:32:49,639
- You can't do this to people in America!
- I told you to stay over there!

755
01:32:49,812 --> 01:32:52,280
- My wife...
- Government's doing everything they can...

756
01:32:52,448 --> 01:32:55,474
...to get you out of here.
Please don't worry. It's all right.

757
01:32:55,651 --> 01:32:58,211
We're doing everything
to make sure you're safe.

758
01:32:58,387 --> 01:33:01,254
We'll get you back to your homes
within hours.

759
01:33:10,866 --> 01:33:12,527
All clear.

760
01:33:35,057 --> 01:33:37,821
Can I help you, sir?
What's your name?

761
01:33:37,993 --> 01:33:42,020
- Henry. Dr. Henry Devlin.
- A doctor? Good.

762
01:33:42,197 --> 01:33:43,858
We need doctors in there.

763
01:33:45,734 --> 01:33:48,259
Come on, laddie, I'll buy you a cup.

764
01:33:50,272 --> 01:33:54,902
- You, sir, where you from?
- Boston.

765
01:33:55,577 --> 01:34:01,140
Beantown? Great city.
We'll have you back there in no time.

766
01:34:01,316 --> 01:34:03,147
Maybe by morning.

767
01:34:04,253 --> 01:34:06,187
Hurry up, bucko.

768
01:34:16,632 --> 01:34:19,328
You see that crud on the faces
of children...

769
01:34:19,501 --> 01:34:23,665
...you know why I relish a turn
in the country like we had today.

770
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:29,168
You were excellent out there, O.
It made me feel very proud to...

771
01:34:32,114 --> 01:34:35,948
Abe?
Abe, you okay?

772
01:34:37,352 --> 01:34:39,343
Abe?

773
01:34:46,228 --> 01:34:51,564
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
I must be getting too old for this shit.

774
01:34:52,701 --> 01:34:55,499
I don't know what the hell that was about.

775
01:35:09,451 --> 01:35:11,783
It's the only way, Owen.

776
01:35:12,588 --> 01:35:15,250
We've got to cauterize the site.

777
01:35:16,859 --> 01:35:18,850
They've all got to die.

778
01:35:20,262 --> 01:35:21,854
It's the only way.

779
01:35:22,097 --> 01:35:23,894
But we don't know that.

780
01:35:24,099 --> 01:35:28,536
The studies point to the strong possibility
of recovery for many exposed subjects.

781
01:35:28,704 --> 01:35:31,434
The studies show squat,
that's what they show.

782
01:35:31,607 --> 01:35:34,838
If Matheson had been in my spot
for the last quarter-century...

783
01:35:34,977 --> 01:35:37,605
...you'd have never made
it to your first jerk-off.

784
01:35:38,046 --> 01:35:42,415
Those gray bastards would have had you
for lunch back in Armpit, Kentucky.

785
01:35:42,584 --> 01:35:45,917
Some get better. At least
half will be over it in a few days...

786
01:35:46,088 --> 01:35:48,283
Which ones, Mother Teresa?

787
01:35:48,457 --> 01:35:52,723
Can you guarantee they won't take it home
like a present for the family?

788
01:35:52,928 --> 01:35:56,830
I'll tell you what you should be worried
about. What should be on your mind.

789
01:35:56,999 --> 01:35:58,626
Not these few unfortunates.

790
01:35:59,101 --> 01:36:01,661
What you should be worried
about is a hitchhiker.

791
01:36:01,837 --> 01:36:03,304
- What?
- A hitchhiker.

792
01:36:03,472 --> 01:36:06,566
Our greatest fear is that a grayboy
would catch a ride...

793
01:36:06,742 --> 01:36:10,735
...with somebody and would carry them
out of here, without being consumed.

794
01:36:11,013 --> 01:36:14,039
To scatter the infection,
like Johnny-fucking-Appleseed.

795
01:36:14,216 --> 01:36:16,480
- Are you sure there isn't such a person?
- No.

796
01:36:16,652 --> 01:36:19,212
But I am sure that if there is one
he won't get out.

797
01:36:19,388 --> 01:36:22,084
Not with the net my boys
put up around the Blue Zone.

798
01:36:22,357 --> 01:36:25,155
And if we do a thorough job
on the ones we've got.

799
01:36:25,327 --> 01:36:29,730
If we don't get gooey about the little picture
when our job is taking care of the big one.

800
01:36:30,399 --> 01:36:31,730
<i>Capisce?</i>

801
01:36:32,134 --> 01:36:36,093
Owen, if you think this is easy for me,
you're crazier than my mother was.

802
01:36:37,673 --> 01:36:39,265
Those poor schmucks.

803
01:36:40,075 --> 01:36:43,841
They drive Chevrolets, shop at Wal-Mart...

804
01:36:44,012 --> 01:36:46,003
...never miss an episode of <i>Friends</i>.

805
01:36:47,082 --> 01:36:48,947
These are Americans.

806
01:36:50,686 --> 01:36:52,881
The idea of slaughtering Americans...

807
01:36:55,691 --> 01:36:57,921
...it just turns my stomach.

808
01:37:01,964 --> 01:37:06,196
But I'll do it.
I'll do it because it needs to be done.

809
01:37:07,669 --> 01:37:12,129
So if we start at 2, we can be done
by 2:30. And it's all behind us.

810
01:37:13,075 --> 01:37:15,066
Except for the dreams.

811
01:37:18,046 --> 01:37:20,446
Yeah, except for them.

812
01:37:32,694 --> 01:37:36,095
What are you gonna tell Rita
about what you did here?

813
01:37:36,398 --> 01:37:39,959
What are you gonna tell Katrina
when she's old enough to ask?

814
01:37:43,638 --> 01:37:48,234
You know me, don't you? I don't remember
when we met, but you know me.

815
01:37:48,477 --> 01:37:52,379
We don't have time to screw around.
You've got two problems.

816
01:37:52,547 --> 01:37:55,846
- One you know about, one you don't.
- Go ahead.

817
01:37:56,451 --> 01:38:02,287
Your mentor, Colonel Curtis, he's gone
insane from hunting aliens for 25 years.

818
01:38:02,457 --> 01:38:06,450
Now he wants you to help him
kill hundreds of innocent people.

819
01:38:07,529 --> 01:38:09,520
- Who are you?
- Me?

820
01:38:09,698 --> 01:38:12,690
Talk about that later,
once we get out of here.

821
01:38:13,668 --> 01:38:16,694
You're predictable.
You won't let me burn on this fence...

822
01:38:16,872 --> 01:38:19,534
...any more than you'll help
Curtis kill those people.

823
01:38:19,708 --> 01:38:23,474
What you're thinking now is whether
that digital sat-scan transmitter...

824
01:38:23,645 --> 01:38:26,705
...in your duffle bag will
let you get through to somebody.

825
01:38:27,749 --> 01:38:30,718
Somebody named General Matheson.

826
01:38:34,022 --> 01:38:39,426
"Sometimes we have to kill,
but our real job is to save lives."

827
01:38:43,598 --> 01:38:45,896
Your father was a great soldier.

828
01:38:46,368 --> 01:38:47,835
Those were his last words.

829
01:38:48,003 --> 01:38:50,164
You carry his picture with you always.

830
01:38:53,308 --> 01:38:54,935
Tell me everything.

831
01:38:56,111 --> 01:38:58,045
You'll save these people.

832
01:38:58,213 --> 01:39:01,671
When we're done talking, get on the
transmitter, contact Matheson.

833
01:39:01,850 --> 01:39:03,112
Cavalry rides in.

834
01:39:03,285 --> 01:39:06,584
That takes care of problem number one.
Now comes the hard part.

835
01:39:06,755 --> 01:39:11,317
You think the infection's been contained,
that there's no hitchhiker.

836
01:39:11,493 --> 01:39:15,190
You're wrong. He's riding with
my best friend on Earth.

837
01:39:15,363 --> 01:39:18,264
A guy named Gary Jones.
And he's out there.

838
01:39:18,834 --> 01:39:23,168
You and I don't get after him right away,
he'll get out of my range...

839
01:39:23,371 --> 01:39:26,306
...and some kind of shit
is gonna hit the planetary fan.

840
01:39:40,689 --> 01:39:42,816
Our nightmare hitchhiker.

841
01:39:43,425 --> 01:39:48,954
And all Dr. Mystery wants is a free pass
so he can catch his friend.

842
01:39:49,131 --> 01:39:52,396
- Very convenient.
- I'm saying you ought to hear his story.

843
01:39:52,801 --> 01:39:54,234
Okay. Where is he?

844
01:39:54,402 --> 01:39:56,199
Had him taken to the tractor shed.

845
01:39:56,671 --> 01:40:00,072
Okay. I'll check him out
and we can compare notes.

846
01:40:00,242 --> 01:40:01,937
Whatever you say, boss.

847
01:40:08,817 --> 01:40:12,218
Come on, come on. Time's a-wasting.

848
01:40:22,164 --> 01:40:24,291
All right, lad, open up.

849
01:40:42,717 --> 01:40:44,014
Dr. Boston?

850
01:40:45,420 --> 01:40:46,751
Are you in here?

851
01:40:48,156 --> 01:40:49,623
I'm here.

852
01:40:49,758 --> 01:40:51,055
Where I've been put.

853
01:40:52,227 --> 01:40:54,457
A prisoner on my own damn property.

854
01:40:59,234 --> 01:41:00,565
Let's go!

855
01:41:02,270 --> 01:41:03,669
Come on, let's go.

856
01:41:10,312 --> 01:41:11,870
Get in!

857
01:41:13,982 --> 01:41:15,711
You almost ran me down.

858
01:41:15,884 --> 01:41:18,785
Figured you'd read my mind
and get out of the way.

859
01:41:21,890 --> 01:41:26,725
<i>Blue Unit, stand down.</i>
<i>You are under regular Army command.</i>

860
01:41:26,895 --> 01:41:28,886
<i>Put down your weapons at once.</i>

861
01:41:29,965 --> 01:41:32,490
<i>Your mission is rescinded.</i>

862
01:41:32,667 --> 01:41:36,000
<i>This is no longer a Blue Unit operation.</i>

863
01:41:36,171 --> 01:41:41,302
<i>Put down your arms.</i>
<i>Repeat, put down your arms.</i>

864
01:41:41,476 --> 01:41:44,707
<i>General Matheson has assumed command.</i>

865
01:41:54,089 --> 01:41:55,351
Okay, Owen.

866
01:41:56,024 --> 01:41:57,321
Okay.

867
01:41:58,026 --> 01:42:01,154
You just drove over the Curtis line.

868
01:42:03,331 --> 01:42:05,196
- Where we going?
- South.

869
01:42:05,367 --> 01:42:08,131
All I know right now.
Just get me in range of Jonesy...

870
01:42:08,303 --> 01:42:10,203
...we'll know everything we need to know.

871
01:42:33,928 --> 01:42:36,726
That's some gun.
Can I have a look?

872
01:42:44,005 --> 01:42:47,338
- Kind of flashy for a guy like you, isn't it?
- It's a gift.

873
01:42:47,509 --> 01:42:49,170
I know.

874
01:42:51,346 --> 01:42:52,836
Where are you, Jonesy?

875
01:42:53,014 --> 01:42:56,074
Pick up the phone. Call 1-800-HENRY.

876
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:14,534
Hello? Jonesy!

877
01:43:14,703 --> 01:43:18,400
Jesus Christ, I knew it was you.
Where's he taking you?

878
01:43:19,174 --> 01:43:21,369
Massachusetts? He is?

879
01:43:21,676 --> 01:43:25,203
Duddits? Okay, I will.
You hang in there, Jonesy.

880
01:43:25,380 --> 01:43:26,677
Jonesy?

881
01:43:27,349 --> 01:43:28,748
He hung up.

882
01:43:29,851 --> 01:43:31,512
Give me back my gun.

883
01:43:33,788 --> 01:43:36,222
- We gotta go to Derry.
- That where they're going?

884
01:43:36,391 --> 01:43:39,519
No, they're going towards Massachusetts.
We need Duddits.

885
01:43:39,694 --> 01:43:42,720
Jonesy says Mr. Gray is afraid of Duddits.

886
01:43:42,897 --> 01:43:46,958
Your buddy, he's still alive
after all this time with Mr. Gray?

887
01:43:47,135 --> 01:43:49,968
Yeah, he's immune.
I think it's because he died.

888
01:43:51,706 --> 01:43:55,870
He got hit by a car
and his heart stopped. Twice.

889
01:43:56,044 --> 01:43:57,875
I don't think he even knows it.

890
01:43:58,213 --> 01:44:01,740
He came back from the dead.
Must have changed him somehow.

891
01:44:03,485 --> 01:44:08,013
It's almost like Duddits saw
this whole thing coming. Is that it?

892
01:44:10,392 --> 01:44:14,328
Jonesy told me it was Duddits
who drew him into the accident.

893
01:44:14,496 --> 01:44:17,124
If we catch him,
we're gonna have to kill him.

894
01:44:17,499 --> 01:44:21,060
You know we have to do it.
It's the only way to stop Mr. Gray...

895
01:44:21,636 --> 01:44:23,661
...assuming we can catch him.

896
01:44:26,808 --> 01:44:29,174
When was the last time you saw Duddits?

897
01:44:29,344 --> 01:44:30,971
Long time ago.

898
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:33,479
Years.

899
01:44:34,916 --> 01:44:37,180
What makes you so sure he can help?

900
01:44:37,752 --> 01:44:39,379
Duddits can do anything.

901
01:44:40,355 --> 01:44:44,621
I didn't understand that then,
but I think it's always been true.

902
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:47,851
He's the one who made us like this.

903
01:44:48,029 --> 01:44:50,827
- Like what?
- You know, weird.

904
01:45:07,081 --> 01:45:08,673
He's been waiting for you.

905
01:45:08,850 --> 01:45:10,215
Blizzard slowed us up.

906
01:45:10,385 --> 01:45:12,546
Henny, Henny.

907
01:45:13,688 --> 01:45:15,155
Henny.

908
01:45:19,928 --> 01:45:22,123
I miss you, Henny.

909
01:45:22,297 --> 01:45:24,265
I miss you.

910
01:45:26,868 --> 01:45:28,426
Henny.

911
01:45:28,670 --> 01:45:31,002
Long time, Henny.

912
01:45:36,211 --> 01:45:40,341
- My God, Roberta, what is it?
- Lymphocytic leukemia.

913
01:45:43,418 --> 01:45:47,878
I'm gonna let you take him,
but I have to tell you why.

914
01:45:48,923 --> 01:45:51,551
Just now, when he was getting ready...

915
01:45:53,428 --> 01:45:56,829
...Henry he was so excited.

916
01:45:56,998 --> 01:45:59,899
Like he hasn't been in such a long time.

917
01:46:06,941 --> 01:46:08,704
I think...

918
01:46:08,877 --> 01:46:12,438
...that if he's with you,
he might die happy...

919
01:46:12,914 --> 01:46:15,246
...instead of in this awful room.

920
01:46:17,719 --> 01:46:21,211
Be sure the parka stays on tight.
Cold devastates him.

921
01:46:22,223 --> 01:46:25,386
The medication and instructions are in here.

922
01:46:26,761 --> 01:46:28,285
Bye, Mom.

923
01:46:41,576 --> 01:46:44,739
Goodbye, Duddie. Be a good boy.

924
01:46:46,881 --> 01:46:49,213
Now, go save the world.

925
01:47:18,246 --> 01:47:19,873
I'm all right, laddie.

926
01:47:20,081 --> 01:47:23,778
They haven't got enough courage
to take my trailer. Not yet, anyway.

927
01:47:23,952 --> 01:47:25,180
What've we got?

928
01:47:25,353 --> 01:47:30,484
They're leaving Derry, Maine, heading
south on 95. Toward Massachusetts.

929
01:47:30,658 --> 01:47:32,285
Massachusetts?

930
01:47:34,195 --> 01:47:35,924
Stay with it, bucko.

931
01:47:48,509 --> 01:47:50,670
General Matheson. Come in, please.

932
01:47:54,282 --> 01:47:55,806
This is very nice, Abe.

933
01:47:55,984 --> 01:47:58,452
Been home through some rough times.

934
01:47:58,686 --> 01:48:01,120
Was there something we hadn't covered?

935
01:48:01,522 --> 01:48:05,390
I don't think I got to say before
how much I respect the work you've done.

936
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:07,425
It was with sincere regret...

937
01:48:07,595 --> 01:48:09,790
Herman... May I call you Herman?

938
01:48:10,431 --> 01:48:14,765
We may not agree on all the strategic
initiatives, but we do agree on this:

939
01:48:14,936 --> 01:48:19,600
I'm past it. Burned out.
Just needed a push, that's all.

940
01:48:19,907 --> 01:48:22,705
Should have quit
after that mess in Montana.

941
01:48:25,079 --> 01:48:27,639
Even I don't trust my judgment anymore.

942
01:48:29,217 --> 01:48:30,650
Oh, yeah...

943
01:48:30,818 --> 01:48:34,777
My techies tell me we're getting
some electronics reading hot from in here.

944
01:48:35,123 --> 01:48:38,354
Yes, I've been talking
to the wife on my sat phone.

945
01:48:38,526 --> 01:48:42,690
I don't know if you've ever met Barbara.
She's been after me for years to retire.

946
01:48:42,864 --> 01:48:47,392
She's very happy, I can tell you that.
I'll have everything shut down in an hour.

947
01:48:47,602 --> 01:48:50,435
If that's soon enough.

948
01:48:51,005 --> 01:48:52,700
That will be fine.

949
01:49:40,655 --> 01:49:42,782
How do you turn off the goddamn lights?

950
01:49:42,957 --> 01:49:46,324
<i>Maybe you shouldn't have been</i>
<i>so fast to kill that trooper.</i>

951
01:49:46,494 --> 01:49:48,121
<i>You're making yourself at home.</i>

952
01:49:48,296 --> 01:49:51,925
You have no idea, Jonesy.
Tell me how you like this:

953
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:56,764
"Maybe you shouldn't have been
so fast to kill that trooper." Not bad?

954
01:49:58,072 --> 01:49:59,733
Oh, don't like that, Gary, do you?

955
01:50:00,975 --> 01:50:04,570
Ownzy. He's in a police car now.

956
01:50:05,646 --> 01:50:07,307
He's in a police car now.

957
01:50:07,482 --> 01:50:09,279
Can you see where they are, Duds?

958
01:50:10,985 --> 01:50:14,148
Ownzy. He's in Ister Gay.

959
01:50:15,723 --> 01:50:17,213
Mr. Gray.

960
01:50:17,759 --> 01:50:19,954
That's right, Duds, he is in Mr. Gray.

961
01:50:20,128 --> 01:50:22,221
"Ister Gay" is Mr. Gray.

962
01:50:22,563 --> 01:50:23,962
We gotta save this girl.

963
01:50:24,966 --> 01:50:26,433
Save the world?

964
01:50:26,601 --> 01:50:30,128
Not the world, Duds, a girl.
We'll save the world some other time.

965
01:50:30,304 --> 01:50:31,362
Ister Gay?

966
01:50:35,009 --> 01:50:36,840
You already knew.

967
01:50:39,113 --> 01:50:40,944
Where's he going, Duds?

968
01:50:41,749 --> 01:50:44,650
Where is Mr. Gray taking Jonesy?

969
01:51:00,868 --> 01:51:03,496
Ister Gay, he want war.

970
01:51:03,704 --> 01:51:06,195
- War?
- Not war, water.

971
01:51:07,275 --> 01:51:08,936
Mr. Gray wants water.

972
01:51:09,610 --> 01:51:10,872
I know where he's going.

973
01:51:11,045 --> 01:51:13,809
- He's going to the Quabbin Reservoir.
- What's Quabbin?

974
01:51:13,981 --> 01:51:16,575
It supplies drinking water for all of Boston.

975
01:51:18,619 --> 01:51:19,950
What?

976
01:51:21,823 --> 01:51:24,485
One worm kills the world.

977
01:51:25,159 --> 01:51:27,627
One worm kills the world?

978
01:51:28,896 --> 01:51:32,024
Oh, my God. One worm.

979
01:51:32,233 --> 01:51:35,669
Back at our cabin, I saw the worms
that come out of these weasels.

980
01:51:35,837 --> 01:51:38,931
Mr. Gray must want to get one
into the Boston drinking supply.

981
01:51:41,809 --> 01:51:44,835
Just one worm infects the whole world?

982
01:51:46,881 --> 01:51:48,371
- Are we going right?
- Yes.

983
01:51:48,549 --> 01:51:53,179
Take the 495 to the Mass Pike.
It's not far. You're doing great, buddy.

984
01:51:53,387 --> 01:51:57,380
Now, are you ready to try something hard?
I want to ask you something hard.

985
01:51:57,558 --> 01:51:59,116
Yes, Henny.

986
01:51:59,293 --> 01:52:03,787
Good. Can you talk to Jonesy?

987
01:52:04,565 --> 01:52:06,499
Can you make him hear you?

988
01:52:07,235 --> 01:52:08,896
Ownzy...

989
01:52:10,771 --> 01:52:13,296
...and Ister Gay.

990
01:52:14,642 --> 01:52:15,768
Duddits.

991
01:52:26,120 --> 01:52:30,284
I knew it. I knew it.
He's been here all along.

992
01:52:30,458 --> 01:52:31,755
Waiting.

993
01:52:32,460 --> 01:52:36,726
Jonesy? It appears
we didn't meet by accident.

994
01:52:38,132 --> 01:52:41,590
We owe it to our friend, Duddits.

995
01:52:41,836 --> 01:52:45,636
- <i>I don't know what you mean.</i>
- No? Maybe not.

996
01:52:45,806 --> 01:52:49,298
Maybe your clever friend didn't want
you to know what he was up to.

997
01:52:49,477 --> 01:52:54,471
That's why you had nothing
in the warehouse about me.

998
01:52:55,816 --> 01:52:59,274
Duddits didn't bother to tell you
what job he had in mind for you.

999
01:53:00,988 --> 01:53:02,580
It doesn't matter.

1000
01:53:04,592 --> 01:53:08,426
His little scheme didn't work.
Did it, lke? No, no.

1001
01:53:08,596 --> 01:53:09,927
We're almost there.

1002
01:53:11,732 --> 01:53:14,064
What was it your poetry file had to say?

1003
01:53:14,769 --> 01:53:18,330
<i>I have promises to keep</i>
<i>And miles to go before I sleep</i>

1004
01:53:21,742 --> 01:53:26,008
<i>And miles to go before I sleep</i>

1005
01:53:47,468 --> 01:53:49,299
Stop that chopper!

1006
01:54:18,699 --> 01:54:20,564
<i>Punch it, dude. Don't be a pussy.</i>

1007
01:54:23,604 --> 01:54:25,071
Thank you, Gary Jones.

1008
01:54:43,657 --> 01:54:45,591
Go up around the reservoir.

1009
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:48,628
Aqueduct to Boston starts in Shaft 12.

1010
01:55:12,286 --> 01:55:14,481
Patience, <i>bambino</i>.

1011
01:55:14,655 --> 01:55:16,885
Just up ahead.

1012
01:56:46,213 --> 01:56:49,444
Stay here and take care of your friend.

1013
01:56:50,117 --> 01:56:52,415
No matter what you hear.

1014
01:57:09,003 --> 01:57:10,436
So long, doctor.

1015
01:57:24,518 --> 01:57:26,713
Good doggy.

1016
01:57:26,887 --> 01:57:28,548
Good girl.

1017
01:59:25,172 --> 01:59:26,537
Shit!

1018
01:59:27,141 --> 01:59:28,802
You son of a bitch!

1019
01:59:49,330 --> 01:59:50,991
Wait.

1020
01:59:51,265 --> 01:59:52,596
Wait.

1021
02:00:24,798 --> 02:00:26,857
Go back to car, Duddie.

1022
02:00:27,034 --> 02:00:28,729
You'll be safer there.

1023
02:01:13,781 --> 02:01:15,146
Look out, Jonesy.

1024
02:01:42,075 --> 02:01:44,566
I knew you'd come, Henry.

1025
02:01:45,446 --> 02:01:47,311
I knew you wouldn't let me die.

1026
02:01:47,815 --> 02:01:50,443
Who the fuck are you?

1027
02:01:54,321 --> 02:01:57,484
- Don't you know me, H?
- I don't know.

1028
02:01:59,893 --> 02:02:02,760
I think I'm gonna have to shoot you.

1029
02:02:02,930 --> 02:02:04,227
Just to be sure.

1030
02:02:07,835 --> 02:02:10,463
Well, maybe you're right, my friend.

1031
02:02:11,305 --> 02:02:14,570
I don't know myself if Mr. Gray is gone.

1032
02:02:15,576 --> 02:02:18,545
He could be hiding in here somewhere...

1033
02:02:19,613 --> 02:02:21,547
...waiting for his chance.

1034
02:02:37,397 --> 02:02:40,230
Tell me something Mr. Gray
couldn't possibly know.

1035
02:02:42,402 --> 02:02:44,529
Tell me something only we would know.

1036
02:02:50,611 --> 02:02:52,704
SSDD.

1037
02:02:57,484 --> 02:02:59,179
Not good enough.

1038
02:03:03,123 --> 02:03:06,684
Well, you decide. Ask me anything.

1039
02:03:23,810 --> 02:03:27,871
At Tracker Brothers, day we met Duddits...

1040
02:03:29,583 --> 02:03:32,143
...what was painted
on the wall by the window?

1041
02:03:45,432 --> 02:03:46,729
No...

1042
02:03:50,170 --> 02:03:51,432
...bounce...

1043
02:04:01,548 --> 02:04:02,981
No play.

1044
02:04:06,486 --> 02:04:08,283
Hello...

1045
02:04:08,789 --> 02:04:10,120
...Ister Gay.

1046
02:04:46,059 --> 02:04:47,321
You.

1047
02:04:47,628 --> 02:04:50,290
Ooby-Ooby-Doo...

1048
02:04:51,164 --> 02:04:53,496
...we got some work to do now.

1049
02:05:06,847 --> 02:05:09,145
Ister Gay...

1050
02:05:09,783 --> 02:05:11,546
...go away.

1051
02:05:49,389 --> 02:05:51,448
No!

1052
02:06:13,180 --> 02:06:15,648
I Duddits.

1053
02:07:39,533 --> 02:07:40,693
H?

1054
02:07:58,051 --> 02:07:59,313
Jonesy.

1055
02:08:05,358 --> 02:08:09,192
Jonesy, if that really is your name...

1056
02:08:15,435 --> 02:08:17,960
- That'll be 50 small.
- Bullshit.

1057
02:08:20,607 --> 02:08:22,939
- I Duddits.
- I Duddits.

1058
02:08:23,109 --> 02:08:25,475
They're my friends. We're all best friends.

1059
02:08:25,645 --> 02:08:28,944
Here's to Duddits, our dreamcatcher.

1060
