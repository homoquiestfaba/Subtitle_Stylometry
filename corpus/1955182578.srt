00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,170
It's off.

3
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,880
- Did anybody see me come in?
- I don't think so.

4
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,560
- I did.
- Fuck off, Bert.

5
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,770
Okay, now, young man, look here.

6
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,820
All of this,

7
00:04:10,943 --> 00:04:14,797
okay, you can get a hit off of any of
these and change the whole investigation.

8
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,329
With this is an very
interesting ashtray.

9
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:20,419
Sorry, Lieutenant, Captain Harris
is out front, he's looking for you.

10
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,200
- Already?
- Yes.

11
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,819
All right, hold on,
let me just...

12
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,160
Don't let anyone touch my bag.

13
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,020
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck, Sir.

14
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,170
<i>These guys have been
in business for a while.

15
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,871
- Can you hand me a bag, please?
- Yeah.

16
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,430
- Thank you.
<i>- Ooh! Check this thing out!

17
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,406
This mobile unit is
specifically designed to help with

18
00:04:53,456 --> 00:04:55,976
chain of custody for the
evidence we collect on-site.

19
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:57,481
- It's all computerized,
- Uh-huh.

20
00:04:57,531 --> 00:05:00,239
we check for DNA, fingerprints
without ever needing to change hands.

21
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,340
- It's uh...
- It's very detailed, I know, but...

22
00:05:02,464 --> 00:05:03,199
Expensive!

23
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,689
Look, Jim, I don't know
what I can do about this,

24
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,249
you're gonna have to
talk to the Commander.

25
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,983
But I did, and he told me
I need to speak with you.

26
00:05:10,095 --> 00:05:11,195
Right.

27
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,790
Ya know, you really should just
talk to the Commander about it.

28
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,090
Yes, Sir,
absolutely, Sir.

29
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,650
Oh!

30
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,590
<i>I'm fucked! Help!

31
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,340
Ah!

32
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,060
- Are you all right, Bert?
- Fuck no, I'm not all right!

33
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,270
I haven't had a cigarette.

34
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,682
So what was it you needed
to talk to me about then, Captain?

35
00:05:44,732 --> 00:05:48,838
You guys down at Property
had tagged this little puppy

36
00:05:48,888 --> 00:05:51,980
and it's goin'
up for auction this week.

37
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,080
Okay.

38
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,939
- I want it as a gift to my son-in-law.
- That's... very thoughtful of you.

39
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,121
Well, ya know, he's a good kid.

40
00:05:59,171 --> 00:06:02,320
Would you mind headin' down to
the O.P.G. and checkin' it out?

41
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,876
I want our guys in the
garage to know I got my eye on it.

42
00:06:04,926 --> 00:06:07,259
- Well, I can look into it for you, of course.
- Great.

43
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,329
That's great, 'cause I think we have
everything under control here.

44
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,800
No, I have my...
no, you can keep that.

45
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,836
I'm sorry, you want me to
go to the garage right now?

46
00:06:16,305 --> 00:06:17,635
Yeah.

47
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,770
What the shit is this?

48
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,450
- Is that a lawn mower?
- It's for Harris.

49
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,160
For a Captain,
that guy's a real shit heel.

50
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,469
<i>And $5,000, the bill to bid to</i> buy,
I'm gonna get 5 where, who'll give me 2,500.

51
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,509
<i>twenty-five, thank you, Ma'am, now I'll
take a bidder, think big, so now it's better...

52
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,598
<i>I'm 7, who's gonna give 7,
now 7, now 8, give me 9...

53
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,617
- He wants this thing for his son?
- Son-in-LAW.

54
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:52,050
Well, okay, that's quite the gesture.

55
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,770
Yeah, we'll keep it off the floor.

56
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,480
<i>Nice car.

57
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,576
What happened here?

58
00:07:13,626 --> 00:07:17,010
<i>That car was dead when we got it,</i>
someone gutted the engine completely,

59
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,763
But, look what we found
when we popped the hood.

60
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,807
- This is full of cocaine.
- Yes, I know.

61
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,977
This needs to be
submitted as evidence.

62
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:32,019
Yes, right, absolutely, sorry,

63
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:34,600
It will, it will be
submiited, check this out.

64
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,332
Fits like a glove, right, quite the
clever way to move coke, if you ask me.

65
00:07:43,382 --> 00:07:45,002
I mean, who check the engine block.?

66
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,691
- Well, I guess... I did.
- Who owned the car?

67
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,760
A local guy,
a drug dealer, obviously.

68
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,978
I got the paperwork for the arrest on the
desk back there, if you want to check it out.

69
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,689
<i>Yes, Sir, he's out back.

70
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:15,890
<i>Hey!

71
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:20,092
The Captain wants to know if you can take a few
new pictures of the John Deere before you leave.

72
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,677
Just, like with your phone...
or whatever.

73
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,420
What do you think?

74
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:07,340
<i>Well, I think that</i> there's a lot
more to makin' a cop than just paper.

75
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,643
Yes... but I just...
thought it was unusual.

76
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:15,049
It is.

77
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,668
<i>Ya know,</i> a good cop is gonna
look at it and know exactly what to do.

78
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,219
- Hello?
- Yes, I do, I just have to...

79
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,908
- Was it something I said?
- No, I just have to make a phone call.

80
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,838
What the fuck, Dude!

81
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,810
What?

82
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,753
-<i> You don't see anything unusual?</i>
- Where have you brought me?

83
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,560
Look at the guy's sheet.

84
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,520
- Why, why would I...
- Look, what do you notice?

85
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,617
- He had a lotta priors.
- And?

86
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:40,147
- "And", what "and"?
- All right, the girl's coming.

87
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,120
Hi, I'll have a refill and...

88
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,250
- Water.
- Okay.

89
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,655
She never told me...
She had a pot in her hand...

90
00:10:51,705 --> 00:10:53,817
Okay, well, that's all right, she's probably...
where are you going?

91
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,428
This place is freaking me out.

92
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,149
Would you just hold on a second, please,
there... there... there's something to this...

93
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,119
Could you just sit down...
humor me for a second.

94
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,178
- Let's just talk about it tomorrow.
- Check out the guy's bail receipt.

95
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,650
<i>Excuse me!</i>
'Scuse me!

96
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,400
- Bro, this can't be right.
- It is.

97
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,618
- How do you know?
- I checked.

98
00:11:20,668 --> 00:11:22,690
- Was it a bond?
- Cashier's check.

99
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,062
- For $200,000?
- Yeah.

100
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,380
- Who paid that?
- I don't know.

101
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,360
What do you think?

102
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,080
- What do I think?
-<i>Yes.

103
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,510
I think that guy has a
friend with deep pockets.

104
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,819
That's deep, very deep.

105
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,720
I think that guy's
getting a hand job.

106
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,810
<i>He's still eating,
so it's hard to tell.

107
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:52,000
- Are you gonna have those, can I get one?
- What?

108
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:57,290
<i>Who could get that much
cash together that quickly?

109
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,996
Wha... what's that for?

110
00:11:59,046 --> 00:12:00,989
- Have you ever tried it?
- I can't say that I have.

111
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,820
All right, well, you take this one...

112
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,409
and I'll take the other.

113
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,128
What are we, in the sixth grade?
I'm not gonna eat this!

114
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:15,319
He has cash in hand, I'm just sayin', if someone
risked a fortune to get this kid outta of jail,

115
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,740
then, right now, you and I are the
only two people who even seem to notice.

116
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,889
So, whaddya wanna do, ya want
me to rob a drug dealer for ya?

117
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,510
Rob a drug dealer?

118
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,125
Well, right now, I just wanna find
out where the cash is coming from.

119
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,370
I don't think
it's a good idea.

120
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,430
I'm not talking
about anything crazy.

121
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:40,840
Look... look, this guy is a... well,
you read his sheet, he's a nobody.

122
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,019
But he can't be a nobody,
who spends $200,000 on a nobody?

123
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,481
If you want my opinion...

124
00:12:46,531 --> 00:12:50,067
Something like this it is worth doing
if you can keep it quiet and simple, okay?

125
00:12:50,117 --> 00:12:53,386
And what you're talking about here would be
neither of those things, I can promise you that.

126
00:12:53,436 --> 00:12:55,142
Wow, that sounded so cool.

127
00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:00,136
The way you just said that,
right now, that sounded cool.

128
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,760
- What, it tastes good to you?
- Naw, it doesn't.

129
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,801
Sometimes I think I
should really pull it together...

130
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,044
a little bit.

131
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:20,192
- I think they're checkin' us out.
- No, they're not.

132
00:13:20,242 --> 00:13:22,190
- I think they are.
- You're wrong.

133
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,260
I just wanna put a tail on him.

134
00:13:25,351 --> 00:13:29,087
If it's a den then so be it, life
goes on, none the richer.

135
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,785
I'll cover your time off.

136
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,470
All right, I'll do it,
I'll find this guy.

137
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,274
But only because when it come
to you and me, I truly, and...

138
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:48,289
I mean this sincerely, I truly have
nothing better to do, and I despise my job.

139
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,062
That's the spirit!

140
00:13:51,148 --> 00:13:53,855
You are a bad ass!

141
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,136
What the fuck!

142
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,380
What does he do in there?

143
00:15:50,481 --> 00:15:52,295
He works in the first floor restaurant.

144
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,153
I know, but...what is it?

145
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:59,080
You know, he gave us drinks, stocks the bar.
Could you stop that?

146
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,280
Someone has him scared.

147
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,021
- Whaddya mean?
- He shows up to work five nights a week...

148
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,462
- Yeah.
- on time...

149
00:16:07,512 --> 00:16:09,074
- Yeah.
- to stock a bar?

150
00:16:09,124 --> 00:16:10,124
Uh-huh.

151
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,650
He's a drug dealer, Dave.

152
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,390
Jesus!

153
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:40,680
<i>Jim! Jim! You can't just go
marching up to</i> this guy right now!

154
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,690
- You're dressed like a cop.
- I am a cop.

155
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,250
- You know what I mean!
- Look, you gotta give this another week at least.

156
00:16:45,374 --> 00:16:48,449
For what? The kid got rolled and now
his people have him cleaning dishes.

157
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,122
Jesus! Will you stop looking around!

158
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,476
- Are you sure you didn't miss something?
- Yes, I'm sure.

159
00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:55,350
Well, you're out there smoking
that refer, so you might not...

160
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,119
I'm sorry? Am I on an official assignment here?

161
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,989
Short of getting hired as bellhop,
there's nothing that more I can do.

162
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,226
And I'm not wasting anymore
vacation days on this, either.

163
00:17:04,276 --> 00:17:07,228
Don't take this the wrong
way, because we're friends, and

164
00:17:07,278 --> 00:17:09,436
and you're also my boss...
fuck you, Jim!

165
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,004
- This is some bullshit right here.
- David.

166
00:17:12,521 --> 00:17:15,913
David! Stay positive, Dude!

167
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,852
I'm leavin' this with you guys,
Treasury'll be by to pick it up.

168
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:40,227
It's all fake.

169
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,018
- When are they coming?
- How should I know.

170
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:46,690
- Come on, man, I got a lot of shit to do.
- Oh, God, sorry about that.

171
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,450
Can't you just wait for 'em?

172
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,100
I'll tell you what,
I'll flip you for it.

173
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,026
What are you doing?

174
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,172
Would you like to go first,
or should I?

175
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,251
- You?
- Stop it.

176
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:08,135
Okay, I'll go first.

177
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,966
Jesus!Fuck!
What the...

178
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,846
- That's a rush... your turn.
- No.

179
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:17,567
- No?
- Oh fuck!

180
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,594
-<i> Sergeant Waters.

181
00:18:26,624 --> 00:18:30,810
What?
What's this about?

182
00:18:30,911 --> 00:18:34,389
<i>Lieutenant Stahl requested you for his desk
while he's away on a special assignment, Sir.

183
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,840
What are you talking about?
What special assignment?

184
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,000
Jesus Christ!

185
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,540
<i>Jimmy, it's your friend!

186
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,210
Where the hell are you
going at this hour?

187
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:04,919
- Official Police business, Dad.
- Who's the cop?

188
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,622
I am, Dad, we both are...
goodnight.

189
00:22:08,672 --> 00:22:11,669
- Good luck.
- Dad's unusually up-beat tonight.

190
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,167
I know, yeah,
it's good to see, yeah, right?

191
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,302
- What the fuck is this?
- It's my tips.

192
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,870
Don't laugh,
it's more than we make.

193
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,956
So, they're closed on Sunday.

194
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,727
They do the drop-offs in the back,
but where does it go once it's inside?

195
00:22:43,777 --> 00:22:46,242
- Did you check it out?
- It's funny you should mention that.

196
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,790
What, you didn't get hired
as a bag boy or something?

197
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:56,565
- You take these?
-<i> There's one in there, that's...

198
00:22:56,615 --> 00:22:58,724
Ah! Let's just see if you can spot it.

199
00:22:58,774 --> 00:23:00,802
- They're terrible.
- Yeah.

200
00:23:00,852 --> 00:23:02,589
It looks like a bum from
the street took these.

201
00:23:02,639 --> 00:23:05,607
Well, the Lord knows I wasn't
gonna go marching around back there.

202
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,286
You made a homeless
person that these photos?

203
00:23:09,593 --> 00:23:11,270
Why... I paid them a little.

204
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,660
- All right.
- Right.

205
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:20,221
So, I think this is more than just a
money drop or however you call it.

206
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,376
Why would you say that?

207
00:23:21,426 --> 00:23:24,059
Because whatever they're
bringing here, stays here.

208
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,678
<i>Nothing goes out... ever.

209
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,330
- What is this?
- Huh?

210
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,180
Look at the freezer, that lock.

211
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,550
Makes you wonder, doesn't it?

212
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,520
- Look at you.
- What?

213
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,225
- And I'm skippin' right into your little...
- My what?

214
00:23:46,275 --> 00:23:47,966
What's the name of that
girl that solves the crimes.

215
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,590
Nancy Drew...
this is some Nancy Drew shit.

216
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,821
Did you see that one?

217
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,320
Spotted it!

218
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,180
It's that grocery store.

219
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:16,260
I haven't heard anything from
your Department about this.

220
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,639
- What kind of nonsense is this?
- No, no, I...

221
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,410
- You just reached for my phone.
- Yes I did.

222
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,190
- In a suspicious manner.
- No, I wasn't, I swear...

223
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,869
I would suggest that you're here
under the auspice of illegal activity.

224
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:31,411
- What crime is it anyway? You think...
- I'll call the Sheriff.

225
00:24:31,461 --> 00:24:33,490
- I'll give you $100.
- Okay.

226
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,200
All right.

227
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:43,830
Well, you are very lucky that this
investigation is so well funded, I'll tell you that.

228
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,287
<i>Yeah, wipe it.

229
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:55,042
<i>- Wipe it.
- Delete, delete.

230
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,680
- Right there?
- Yeah, stop there, go a few frames back.

231
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,140
<i>- Okay.
- Okay, stop, replay that.

232
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:06,381
<i>Okay, okay,</i> stop, can you
give me some other camera angles?

233
00:25:06,431 --> 00:25:07,791
Sure.

234
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
<i>Now, pause it.

235
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:18,079
Isn't that that sandwich shop on Decatur,
the one that makes the cheese steaks?

236
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,804
Oh, yeah, I've been
there, that place is legit.

237
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,438
Man, that place is delicious.

238
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,340
How ya doin', Bill?

239
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,392
That's the way to go.

240
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,811
<i>The way the cheese
spills over the bread.

241
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,202
- Hey, gotta get a cheeseburger.
- Jim!

242
00:25:31,252 --> 00:25:32,719
All right, give me a hard
copy of that, then wipe it,

243
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,760
- and just keep goin' with the time codes there.
- You got it.

244
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,160
- I looked at the store.
- Yeah?

245
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,821
They recently installed
a new storage unit.

246
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:43,662
<i>According to that work
order, that freezer has

247
00:25:43,766 --> 00:25:47,540
<i>got 36 inches of steel
reinforced concrete protecting it.

248
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:52,098
<i>Now, it could be the world's
most secure meat locker,

249
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,575
<i>but when you consider
the drug dealers,

250
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:57,001
<i>the hotel front and phony laundry
service making one way trips to this place...

251
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,091
<i>And nothing ever goes out.

252
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,586
<i>I think you know exactly
what I'm getting at.

253
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,953
Holy shit!

254
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,568
- Sir.
- Oh, thank you.

255
00:26:10,618 --> 00:26:12,442
- Wipe it?
- Wipe it.

256
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:22,180
Have you ever broken
into a vault before?

257
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:27,076
- No... are you serious right now?
- I don't know.

258
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,730
- Have you?
- No.

259
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,600
<i>- What about this one?</i>
- Yeah, go for it, Lewis.

260
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,847
Ya know, here's a question:

261
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,600
Somebody builds a safe in the
back of a grocery store, right?

262
00:26:37,724 --> 00:26:38,764
Yeah.

263
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,933
- And we found it.
- Precisely.

264
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,490
And we assume it's filled with money, or
drugs or whatever... it's filled with stuff?

265
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,642
Yeah.

266
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:51,668
Well... how do we...
ya know, get it... out?

267
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,359
Hello, can I help you?

268
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,607
Yes, hello.

269
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,205
Just a moment.

270
00:27:28,854 --> 00:27:30,512
Just a moment.

271
00:27:33,804 --> 00:27:35,579
Yes, good.

272
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:40,647
I need a drill.

273
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,260
Wait... wait...

274
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,518
How are you going to pay for it?

275
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,250
Well, my people will contact you
and arrange it, ya, yes.

276
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,707
The Yank's hiding something.

277
00:27:56,757 --> 00:27:58,825
He must be a bank
robber or something.

278
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:01,333
Yeah, so cool.

279
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,709
- I gotta go, you finish up.
-<i> But I'm not authorized.

280
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,750
Who gives a shit?

281
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:19,690
<i>So this is the floor plan for the
apartment that's directly above the vault?

282
00:28:19,995 --> 00:28:23,147
<i>- Yeah, taped it out this morning.
- You did a fine job.

283
00:28:23,397 --> 00:28:24,383
<i>What's this?

284
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,640
<i>That's from the guys in Germany.

285
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,890
This is the quote for the drill?
You know I don't have this money.

286
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:33,430
- I'm sure you'll think of something.
- Where am I gonna get this kind of cash?

287
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:36,400
You're smart, crafty.

288
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,790
What the fuck are you talking about?
Where's your money coming from?

289
00:28:38,874 --> 00:28:39,907
I am refinancing.

290
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,243
- Refinancing what?
- It's a home equity loan, I already applied for it.

291
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,570
You're mortgaging your
house to pay for a heist?

292
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:49,200
- Do you have any idea how insane that is?
- We don't have a lot of time.

293
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,400
Okay, well, like I was saying,
the ceiling is where I think we go in.

294
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,018
The vault door isn't that old, messing
with it runs the risk of a fail-safe...

295
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,927
unless we want to
hire professionals safe crackers...

296
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,930
- Which we don't.
- Which we don't.

297
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:03,908
What you're saying is we drill
down through the floor of the apartment?

298
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:04,942
That's right.

299
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,798
- And where will we do that?
- The dining room.

300
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,674
Let's check it out.

301
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,740
The only other hitch is
there might be a tenant.

302
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,080
What's that?

303
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:25,360
Uh... that's nothing... A bee flew in
my face when I was doing that part.

304
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:30,662
- We'll have to deal with him.
- Who, the tenant?

305
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,188
- Well, do we pay him off?
- Pay him off? What? No!

306
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,833
We'll just tie him
up or whatever.

307
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:39,040
Tie him up or whatever, that sounds
complicated, which one of us is doing that?

308
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,425
Well, I'm sure it won't be easy.

309
00:29:40,475 --> 00:29:43,350
Well, you just said it, like,
whatever, we'll just tie him up.

310
00:29:43,471 --> 00:29:45,421
Well, let's table this for
now, we gotta get back... so...

311
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,510
Are you good for the money,
'cause I wanna put the order in?

312
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,918
Jim, it's 10 grand.

313
00:29:51,968 --> 00:29:55,550
Well, are you good for it
or not, because I'm all in?

314
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,100
Don't leave me hanging.

315
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,675
This took me 3 hours, by the way.

316
00:30:08,666 --> 00:30:10,750
And it's Da Vinci-esque.

317
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,680
All right, yeah, I'll...
I'll figure it out.

318
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,341
You're a positive thinker...
and I respect you.

319
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,310
And I fuckin' dig you.

320
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,500
<i>Have you ever done
one of these before?

321
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,300
<i>No.

322
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:05,540
I'm not doin' this out of
the goodness of my heart.

323
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:08,170
<i>You're asking
for a lot of money.

324
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,766
This is a short term loan.

325
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:13,909
I know.

326
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,582
Let's go.

327
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:29,690
These guys know the score.

328
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,490
One... two might try to run,
if that happens, stop 'em.

329
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:49,546
All right, everybody up.
EVERYBODY UP!

330
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:55,484
<i>Get up! Up! Get against the wall...
right now! Move! Get against that wall!

331
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,978
<i>Get against that wall!
Right now!

332
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,569
- What's happening?
- You are under arrest.

333
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:02,848
If you'll just give me a minute.

334
00:32:02,885 --> 00:32:05,230
<i>...right to remain silent.

335
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:21,089
This is one, I said two,
I said I need two.

336
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,038
That's...
that's all I have.

337
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:26,000
- I said two!
-<i> That's all I have, that's all I have.

338
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,679
I'll tell you what I'll do.

339
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,246
I'll flip ya for it.

340
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,240
No, no, don't, no, no,
please, don't, no, no.

341
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,209
- Whaddya wanna do then?
- No, don't, don't, don't.

342
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,989
- No, no, no.
- Whaddya wanna do.

343
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:59,655
<i>No, no, no.

344
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,380
No.

345
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,120
Go with her, go!

346
00:34:56,601 --> 00:35:00,529
<i>Bobo,</i> that's great.

347
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:30,777
Bobo, Bobo,
Bobo's interesting.

348
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:34,170
Especially for someone
who sells guns.

349
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:39,000
It's fun, ya know, it's...

350
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,333
I'm Jim, by the way.

351
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,289
Hey, where... where are we...
where are we now, is it far?

352
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,750
Man, shut the fuck up!

353
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,380
<i>Fuck!

354
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,696
You can sit your ass right
there until I know we good.

355
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:07,105
And you ain't about that, I'll
stick the party to your ear right now.

356
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,938
You got me?

357
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:16,900
I'm 'standin' that,
it's far?

358
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,565
Get out.

359
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,378
The money!

360
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:56,717
That's a big one.

361
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,550
It's all there,
you can count it.

362
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:06,030
I mean, these are...
brand new, right?

363
00:37:07,012 --> 00:37:08,188
I mean...

364
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,330
you didn't...

365
00:37:12,192 --> 00:37:13,058
like...

366
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:17,130
scrape the serial numbers off
them or anything like that, did you?

367
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,861
Fuckin' whoever you have,
they are hopin' somebody like me...

368
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,777
hope for some<i> corny
motherfucker like you.

369
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,560
Look at that mug.

370
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,255
Get used to it,
he's our new roommate.

371
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,690
- And he's alone in there, correct?
- I've barely seen him leave the place.

372
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,770
- Where did you stash the van?
- The van?

373
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:17,580
No, I just got the plates,
I thought you were gonna get the van.

374
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,010
You were supposed to
take care of both.

375
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,170
No, I remember you sayin' that you...

376
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:26,290
No, no, I didn't, the van was yours,
what the fuck are we gonna do now?

377
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,580
I guess I goofed up,
sorry, dude.

378
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,468
Jesus!

379
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,281
How are we supposed to pull this off?

380
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:42,669
Huh? Really?

381
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,658
Look at this thing!

382
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,350
He can't even keep the
the simplest thing...

383
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,758
We're about to risk our lives here!
Do you realize that?

384
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,642
Do you have any clue how
dangerous it is what we're trying to do?

385
00:39:53,692 --> 00:39:58,460
How many things can go wrong? Or are
you just unable to see that at any point?

386
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:09,000
I picked it up and I stashed it
by the Airport this morning.

387
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:14,560
I'm sorry, David, it was just...
just a little... pre-heist... joke.

388
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:23,620
It was...
was just a joke!

389
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:45,000
Please don't be him, please don't be him,
please don't be him, please don't be him.

390
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,590
We okay?

391
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,240
You look so cool right now.

392
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,597
Now, I'm gonna go in and
make sure we're clear.

393
00:41:22,192 --> 00:41:27,901
And when I KNOW we're clear, I'm gonna
invite YOU via walkie-talkie, all right?

394
00:41:27,951 --> 00:41:29,252
Okay.

395
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,080
Fuck!

396
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:30,880
Get up!

397
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,080
Get the fuck up!

398
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,093
Move!

399
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,300
Get on the bed!
Stay quiet!

400
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,324
Christ!

401
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:29,210
Did you hear anything?

402
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:49,080
I looked away, he came after
me, dragged the girl with him.

403
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,080
I only shot the guy.

404
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,440
<i>Throw her on the bed.

405
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,070
<i>Shove her outta here.

406
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,560
<i>- We need a paintbrush next.
- Where are we gonna put her?

407
00:45:25,704 --> 00:45:27,874
<i>Okay, get her back up.

408
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:32,740
Oh, God, she's choking!

409
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:35,550
<i>Put her over here.

410
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,170
That looks pretty good...

411
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,389
maybe.

412
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:02,665
On three, two, one... up!

413
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,200
Okay, you know the drill.

414
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:26,935
The first bit's spent.

415
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,190
How far are we?

416
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,290
What up?

417
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,804
They changed the recipe.

418
00:49:42,583 --> 00:49:44,330
Ya know, it has my approval.

419
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,510
We're about half way through.

420
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,264
I need a cigarette.

421
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:04,710
Fuck.

422
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,150
I'll take care of this.

423
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:10,020
<i>- What are you gonna to do?</i>
- Something.

424
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:25,041
Hey there.

425
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:28,478
Good evening.

426
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,530
You really gave us a start, man.

427
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:33,824
Yeah, well, I thought I saw some people
unloading some equipment down there...

428
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:38,893
Well, that's likely, we got a stakeout
going on and you nearly walked into it.

429
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,540
A stakeout?

430
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,474
- Detective O'Connor.
- Oh! Uh... Cliff.

431
00:50:45,524 --> 00:50:46,891
Hey.

432
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:06,997
How long have you
been watching?

433
00:51:07,452 --> 00:51:09,803
- Your guy here?
- Tonight?

434
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:11,296
<i>18 hours, I think.

435
00:51:11,541 --> 00:51:13,243
<i>Hey, would you mind turning your lights off?

436
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:17,396
<i>Ya know, I always wanted to be a
cop, it seems like a pretty good deal.

437
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,050
- There are perks.
- Yeah, I bet there are.

438
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:26,180
Ya know, I'm gonna need you
to turn those lights off, Cliff.

439
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:29,353
Oh, yeah, sure thing...
the lights.

440
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:32,949
I'm gonna need your radio, the other calls,
let her know what's going on here.

441
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:37,468
This is undercover stuff, man,
you really can't, sorry.

442
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:42,759
Oh, yeah, right...
Hey, not a problem, Officer!

443
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,336
- Good luck.
- Have a good night, Cliff.

444
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:25,540
No!

445
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:12,111
We gotta move,
we're running behind.

446
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:31,300
Good! Got a bite!

447
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:40,380
Keep going!

448
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:57,693
We must've tripped it.

449
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:02,031
...anything in there.

450
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:12,470
The belt.

451
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:15,060
It's broken.

452
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,060
Do we have any more?

453
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,280
<i>What... what's next, Jim?

454
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:37,455
We'll think of somethin'.

455
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:42,629
- Are we fucked?
- No.

456
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,180
- Uh-uh.
- Okay.

457
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:18,660
We only had a quarter
of an inch left.

458
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:29,337
All right, grab it.

459
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,500
You wanna practice or something?

460
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:43,040
I'll hold it if you'd rather.

461
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:49,400
You haven't had a lot of
coffee today, have you?

462
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:52,340
J.K., go for it.

463
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:03,790
<i>Two more!
</i> Give it t'me good!

464
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,998
It bounces too much...
we're fucked.

465
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:20,508
I have an idea.

466
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,853
It's kind of... whacky.

467
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:38,387
Jim?

468
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,620
- Oh, fuck.
- Did you hear about...

469
00:59:07,470 --> 00:59:09,730
- We're through.
- Okay.

470
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:39,581
Ready.

471
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,060
Okay, I've got the tumbler.

472
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:45,410
And you're right, I see
two fail-safes, which means

473
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:49,096
if we miss a number, that's it,
nothing's gonna get that door open.

474
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:53,550
All right, let's proceed.

475
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,705
<i>Move slowly to the
right and clear it.

476
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:58,840
Moving to zero.

477
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:05,433
Ready.

478
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:07,967
<i>Okay, continue.

479
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,400
Catch!

480
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:32,290
- Ready.
- Just give me a second.

481
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,453
Okay, continue.

482
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:57,360
<i>Catch!

483
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:07,925
Ready.

484
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,433
Slow down, I can't see the notch.

485
01:03:00,550 --> 01:03:02,287
Stop, stop, stop!

486
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,090
<i>Catch... I think.

487
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:07,229
You think?

488
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:10,395
It's behind the other two
rings, and I can barely see it,

489
01:03:10,445 --> 01:03:12,881
but I heard something
latch, did you hear it?

490
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:15,143
<i>No, I didn't.

491
01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:22,260
It's caught...
open it.

492
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:25,292
Are you sure?

493
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,541
<i>Hello?

494
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:33,490
Yeah, open it.

495
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:57,650
Is it open?

496
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:16,735
<i>Opened.

497
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,410
Is it good?

498
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:28,460
What?
What's happening?

499
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:34,630
Can ya hear me?
What is it, just steaks down there?

500
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:38,560
Talk to me,
what are you looking at?

501
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:41,950
<i>You should come down here.

502
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:43,230
Okay.

503
01:05:01,630 --> 01:05:03,444
This is okay.

504
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,550
<i>What the hell is this place?

505
01:05:23,930 --> 01:05:25,886
Did you open this?

506
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,000
We should go back up and clean.

507
01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:24,930
Okay.

508
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,263
<i>Hello?

509
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:06,720
<i>Hello?

510
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:31,230
<i>I have a little boy at home.

511
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:34,573
He's three.

512
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,440
I need to call his father.

513
01:07:41,450 --> 01:07:42,611
Please!

514
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:46,755
<i>Please, that's all I'm asking.

515
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:10,230
Write the number...
write it on my hand.

516
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:52,274
- Hello?
- Yeah, it's me.

517
01:08:52,324 --> 01:08:54,655
<i>Hey...
do you know what time it is?

518
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:57,393
- I checked and it's early.
-<i> Well, whaddya want?

519
01:08:57,513 --> 01:08:59,770
<i>- Can you help me out?
- What is it?

520
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:09,917
- Hi.
- Hey.

521
01:10:03,430 --> 01:10:05,108
Jesus, fuck.

522
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,806
Do you live here?

523
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:19,459
<i>Who lives here?

524
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:23,350
- I don't know what you mean.
- Whose guns are those?

525
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:25,270
What guns?

526
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:27,585
The guns in the closet.

527
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:30,428
I don't know anything about guns.

528
01:10:30,478 --> 01:10:32,345
Whose... you don't know
anything about guns.

529
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,464
- Are they his?
-<i> I don't know!

530
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:37,290
<i>I don't know him!

531
01:10:58,950 --> 01:11:01,060
- Whose guns are those?
- I don't know.

532
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,820
Whose' guns are those?

533
01:11:04,058 --> 01:11:05,071
Huh?

534
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:08,253
- Whose guns are those?
- <i>What do you want with me?

535
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:11,490
<i>- Whose guns are those?</i>
- I don't know him.

536
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,743
<i>I don't know him, I just...

537
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:18,040
He's a goat.

538
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:23,029
I have... I have problems, and pain.

539
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,470
You had bad luck.

540
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:38,444
- What did she say?
- Nothing, she thinks they're his.

541
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,920
<i>- Who the fuck is "he"?</i>
- She doesn't know.

542
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:43,487
These aren't loaded,
you saw that, right?

543
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:47,860
We can't do this.

544
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:52,110
- Whaddya mean?
- Down there isn't just a little...

545
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:56,660
I don't know what this is.

546
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,580
I don't know where
we are right now.

547
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:03,300
We're in the heart of
"the American Dream."

548
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:07,060
I've never seen anything
like this before in my life!

549
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:10,920
- Well, it is a bit of a twist.
- We need to get out of here, man.

550
01:12:11,157 --> 01:12:12,730
- Okay.
- Everything is staying

551
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:14,719
right where we found it,
this is crazy right now.

552
01:12:14,769 --> 01:12:19,136
It is a little crazy, but that doesn't mean
you have to walk away empty handed, David.

553
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:22,758
Empty handed? We'll be lucky
to walk out of here at all.

554
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,490
<i>You brought enough
bags to take everything.

555
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:34,830
Jesus!

556
01:12:35,290 --> 01:12:37,717
- You knew about this.
- What?

557
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:41,120
You did, you knew this was here.

558
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:46,260
No... nobody just finds
something like this outta nowhere!

559
01:12:48,470 --> 01:12:50,150
We did.

560
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,700
- You had your eye on this!
<i>- No, David, I didn't.

561
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:04,095
<i>- I'm just as shocked as you are.</i>
- Well, you don't look it.

562
01:13:04,145 --> 01:13:06,281
Well, I come prepared, that's what you
do when you're someone like me

563
01:13:06,398 --> 01:13:09,200
who refuses to underestimate
the power of positive thinking.

564
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,780
You wanna know how positive I am?

565
01:13:11,237 --> 01:13:16,120
I mean, this was going to be a surprise,
but I can tell you're a little stressed.

566
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:19,973
I'm so positive I've got two tickets in
my pocket right now for the Bahamas...

567
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,434
<i>one with your name on it,

568
01:13:21,484 --> 01:13:23,739
<i>because when we're finished
here, we're gonna celebrate,

569
01:13:23,789 --> 01:13:25,670
drinking rum and smoking cigars.

570
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:28,703
- That's how positive I am.
- Are you trying to stick this on me?

571
01:13:28,753 --> 01:13:31,170
- Is that what's going on?
- Stick what on you?

572
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:32,269
I'm serious!

573
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:35,319
Well, if you're serious, then you
should know you're not making any sense.

574
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:37,859
How long have you been waiting
for someone like me to do this with?

575
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:40,220
A guy you could point the finger at?

576
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,100
David, I thought you were...

577
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:47,362
You know I'd have to be a
genius to plan something like that!

578
01:13:47,412 --> 01:13:51,059
- So tell me another story, Jim.
- Okay... we're friends...

579
01:13:51,109 --> 01:13:53,681
we've had a lot of money,
and I'm super happy about that.

580
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:55,245
There's your story.

581
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,650
- We're not touching...
- Oh, my God!

582
01:13:58,410 --> 01:14:04,054
What does it take to get someone
to split millions of dollars with you?

583
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:05,790
Get in grip!

584
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:31,176
- Jim, the hunt is down.
- David.

585
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,197
<i>Please open it.

586
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,570
<i>I asked you nicely.

587
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:43,580
I'm sorry.

588
01:14:46,590 --> 01:14:50,550
Look, if you're scared,
I get it, it's okay.

589
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:52,583
But I'm not.

590
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:57,680
And... and I've... I've come this
far, so, please open the door.

591
01:14:58,050 --> 01:15:00,040
You'll get us killed for this.

592
01:15:04,150 --> 01:15:06,510
I'm only gonna ask
you one more time.

593
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,883
Please open it.

594
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:15,313
I can't.

595
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:17,490
Open it!

596
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:19,070
- Open it!
- Jim!

597
01:15:19,290 --> 01:15:22,168
Open it! Open it!
Open it! Open it!

598
01:15:22,396 --> 01:15:26,130
Open it! Open it!
Open it! Open it!

599
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,164
<i>I think you should
wait with her,

600
01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:24,179
while I finish loading
up from the gate,

601
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:28,280
and then we'll get
rid of her up north.

602
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:33,580
She saw my face,

603
01:17:34,050 --> 01:17:36,060
what else could we do?

604
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:39,180
All right.

605
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,030
Hey, Dave,
I'm really sorry...

606
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:43,310
Some more here.

607
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:47,150
Okay, you're on soft
ground now, come here.

608
01:22:51,610 --> 01:22:54,581
All right, let me put
you inside... step down.

609
01:22:57,530 --> 01:22:59,150
That's good,
stay down.

610
01:23:12,790 --> 01:23:16,437
<i>Now, this is what's gonna happen:
</i> If you do exactly as I say, you'll live.

611
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:20,510
If you do anything different,
you won't, understand?

612
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:23,140
Jesus! Yes?

613
01:23:23,390 --> 01:23:24,390
<i>Yes.

614
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:26,980
It's been a long
fucking night.

615
01:24:06,150 --> 01:24:08,560
Once we stop,
I'll let you out.

616
01:24:09,020 --> 01:24:12,592
That way you can move on from
this like it never happened, all right?

617
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,590
What do you want from me?

618
01:24:56,780 --> 01:24:58,494
God damn it,
who are they?

619
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:00,730
<i>Who did you call?

620
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:08,996
Tell me or I'll shoot you
through the fucking seat... tell me!

621
01:25:15,050 --> 01:25:16,507
No, no, no, no, I'm a cop!

622
01:25:16,557 --> 01:25:19,423
<i>No, no, no.
