1
00:01:12,801 --> 00:01:15,055
All right, Dawn,
we'll begin with you.

2
00:01:15,056 --> 00:01:16,862
My mom works in a doctor's office

3
00:01:16,863 --> 00:01:18,843
looking at where babies come out.

4
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:20,880
Shh!

5
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,560
Now, why don't you tell us
what you see as your career goals.

6
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:27,841
I want to be a baker
and bake donuts.

7
00:01:28,808 --> 00:01:30,308
All right, who's next?

8
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:38,197
Joseph?

9
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:43,702
Um,

10
00:01:44,526 --> 00:01:45,226
I guess,

11
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,036
a singer.

12
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:53,051
Like,

13
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,008
um, Johnny Ray.

14
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,030
He's a,

15
00:01:59,471 --> 00:02:00,431
whatta you call?

16
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,321
A crooner.

17
00:02:03,426 --> 00:02:05,194
He's real good with the ladies.

18
00:02:06,224 --> 00:02:08,114
My mom collects
all of his records.

19
00:02:08,115 --> 00:02:09,675
Ever since she was little.

20
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,409
She almost met him one time.

21
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:13,159
All right, Alice.

22
00:02:13,411 --> 00:02:14,731
Why don't you tell Joe

23
00:02:15,297 --> 00:02:17,289
what the directions
were, please?

24
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,321
We were supposed to tell
what our parents do for a career.

25
00:02:20,322 --> 00:02:22,122
And then what we wanted to do.

26
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:23,518
That's what, dummy.

27
00:02:24,526 --> 00:02:26,626
Um-hm,
thank you very much, Alice.

28
00:02:28,537 --> 00:02:29,237
Joe!?

29
00:02:30,196 --> 00:02:31,936
My mom works at the rug mill.

30
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:34,886
And where does your father work?

31
00:02:38,619 --> 00:02:39,459
He's a banker.

32
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,414
Joe,
why don't you just tell us

33
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,640
what your father's job is,
so that we can move on, okay?

34
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:48,234
He's,

35
00:02:49,898 --> 00:02:51,098
a singer.
- Joseph!

36
00:02:52,735 --> 00:02:53,435
A spaceman.

37
00:02:54,427 --> 00:02:55,170
Joseph!

38
00:02:56,137 --> 00:02:57,097
He's a magician.

39
00:02:57,561 --> 00:02:58,261
Tell us!

40
00:03:00,038 --> 00:03:00,738
He's dead.

41
00:03:01,135 --> 00:03:02,314
All right, you know what?

42
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:03,882
I've had just about
enough of this, all right?

43
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,083
He's a cleaning man.

44
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:06,919
What?
I couldn't hear you.

45
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,500
Say it louder
so the whole class can hear!

46
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,709
He's the janitor.

47
00:03:11,262 --> 00:03:13,842
Where?! Where does he work?!
And speak up!

48
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:15,527
Here at school.

49
00:03:16,118 --> 00:03:18,055
He cleans out all the toilets.

50
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:21,279
Aw!

51
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:24,809
Silence!

52
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:29,801
You will never touch another child
in my classroom again!

53
00:03:36,714 --> 00:03:40,074
When I tell you to do something,
I expect you to do it.

54
00:03:42,545 --> 00:03:44,187
You're just like your father.

55
00:03:44,913 --> 00:03:46,279
- Bob!?
- Oh God.

56
00:03:46,917 --> 00:03:47,617
- Bob?

57
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,290
Where are the lights?

58
00:03:52,591 --> 00:03:54,991
I want the lights kept on
at all times.

59
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,370
What are you doing?

60
00:03:58,513 --> 00:04:00,402
Are you drinking
down here again?

61
00:04:00,403 --> 00:04:01,103
No, Ann.

62
00:04:01,895 --> 00:04:04,309
I'm telling you,
if I catch you drinking,

63
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,111
or find another bottle
in this office,

64
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,932
you'll be out of here so fast.
Do you hear me?

65
00:04:09,111 --> 00:04:11,811
- Yes, Ann. - No excuses,
no talks, nothing.

66
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:13,292
You'll be out.

67
00:04:15,943 --> 00:04:16,643
Yes, Ann.

68
00:04:18,313 --> 00:04:21,133
I want the sink in my bathroom
repaired today.

69
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,916
And that's another thing.

70
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,237
I'm not some broad
you just picked up.

71
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,218
You refer to me
as Ms. Williams.

72
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,410
You understand?

73
00:04:36,102 --> 00:04:36,802
Yes.

74
00:04:41,859 --> 00:04:43,059
You smell nice, Ann.

75
00:04:44,932 --> 00:04:46,312
Put out that cigarette.

76
00:04:56,989 --> 00:04:57,689
Ho-de-do.

77
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,550
- And then I would smack
her fat ass again.

78
00:05:01,575 --> 00:05:03,495
Smack! Smack...
- Shut up, Ray!

79
00:05:05,804 --> 00:05:07,904
She really pulled down
your pants?

80
00:05:12,555 --> 00:05:13,875
In front of everybody?

81
00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:24,256
That's what I'd have done.

82
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,057
I'd have smacked that fat ass.

83
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,040
I mean, she should have
just been smacked!

84
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:31,417
The... gosh!

85
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,379
That was just terrible.

86
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,564
You can't stay out
of trouble, can you?

87
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,690
Where the hell you going?
Sit back down.

88
00:06:12,797 --> 00:06:15,497
What are we supposed
to eat with? Our hands?

89
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:17,819
Go get the goddamn silverware.

90
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:25,011
Did she tell your father?

91
00:06:25,736 --> 00:06:26,436
I dunno.

92
00:06:28,244 --> 00:06:29,504
She deserved it, Mom.

93
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,057
Hey, go wash your hands,
they're filthy!

94
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,078
Where's the note?

95
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:43,422
What the hell is wrong with you?

96
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,490
Are you that goddamn
stupid? Huh?

97
00:06:46,254 --> 00:06:47,802
They were saying stuff
about Dad.

98
00:06:47,803 --> 00:06:51,538
Let them say whatever they want.
Ignore them, for Christ's sakes!

99
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:54,321
Next time they're going
to put you in Central Tech School

100
00:06:54,322 --> 00:06:57,474
with those crazy, retarded kids.
Is that where you want to end up?

101
00:06:57,475 --> 00:06:59,046
I didn't even do anything.

102
00:06:59,387 --> 00:07:00,087
Shhh.

103
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:09,958
So now you're hitting people?

104
00:07:11,193 --> 00:07:12,453
Okay.
Let's eat now.

105
00:07:13,982 --> 00:07:16,142
No, I'm talking
to your stupid son.

106
00:07:17,177 --> 00:07:18,557
I asked you a question.

107
00:07:18,794 --> 00:07:21,794
So, now you're hitting
little girls with pencils?

108
00:07:22,414 --> 00:07:23,734
It was the eraser end.

109
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:27,859
You listen to me.

110
00:07:28,957 --> 00:07:31,433
If I hear crap like that again
from one of your teachers

111
00:07:31,434 --> 00:07:34,517
I'm gonna knock your fucking
head off, you hear me?

112
00:07:34,518 --> 00:07:36,510
- I didn't even hurt her.
- It's my job!

113
00:07:36,892 --> 00:07:38,692
I work there!
Do you hear me?

114
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,220
Okay.

115
00:07:42,761 --> 00:07:43,461
Okay?

116
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:31,997
Hey, get in.

117
00:08:33,105 --> 00:08:33,805
For what?

118
00:08:34,638 --> 00:08:37,001
- Get in. - What for?
I told Mom to stop at the store.

119
00:08:37,002 --> 00:08:39,777
If you make me get out of this car,
I'm gonna knock your fucking head off.

120
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:41,861
I told Mom I was gonna
stop at the store.

121
00:08:41,862 --> 00:08:43,842
Never mind that.
Get in the car.

122
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:46,625
What, Dad?

123
00:08:47,801 --> 00:08:49,721
I need you to pick something up.

124
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:51,111
- From who?
- Jerry.

125
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:53,339
I gotta work for that guy.

126
00:08:54,516 --> 00:08:55,956
Get in this goddamn car.

127
00:08:57,877 --> 00:09:00,097
You owe him
like a thousand dollars.

128
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,930
Why don't you do your own
fucking dirty work?

129
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:12,159
Get in this car!

130
00:10:07,572 --> 00:10:09,192
What? Buzz off!

131
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:45,287
You're twenty minutes late!

132
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,954
Go cut some squash, and then,

133
00:10:51,152 --> 00:10:52,472
check out the freezer.

134
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,820
You hear me?

135
00:10:56,317 --> 00:10:58,417
And then go out
and check the bar.

136
00:11:00,249 --> 00:11:01,934
And while you're
in the bathroom

137
00:11:01,935 --> 00:11:03,855
put some toilet paper
in there.

138
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,865
You do it,
it's your jerk-off room.

139
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,306
I'll jerk your head off!

140
00:11:21,345 --> 00:11:23,205
Give me three salads with this.

141
00:11:24,925 --> 00:11:27,085
What it is, little man?
What it is?

142
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,870
Did you get something to eat?

143
00:11:32,214 --> 00:11:33,474
Oh, just some Ho Hos.

144
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:34,886
Ho Hos?

145
00:11:35,284 --> 00:11:36,392
Get a sandwich.

146
00:11:36,393 --> 00:11:38,613
Tell Roy to get you
a sandwich, man.

147
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,431
It's all right.
I'll just pick on this.

148
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,735
I wouldn't be touching that
if you saw the leper

149
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,470
who was drooling
all over that shit.

150
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:46,791
Hey Roy, you old fuck!

151
00:11:47,369 --> 00:11:48,069
What?

152
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:51,576
Get the boy a sandwich or something
before he gets hepatitis!

153
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,270
What you talking about,
hepatitis?

154
00:11:53,271 --> 00:11:55,251
Get him a fucking sandwich,
man!

155
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,390
No hepatitis around here.

156
00:11:58,763 --> 00:12:00,782
Here, go upstairs
to my apartment

157
00:12:00,783 --> 00:12:02,223
and get me
some change.

158
00:12:03,852 --> 00:12:04,945
Where are the lemons?

159
00:12:04,946 --> 00:12:05,786
In your pants.

160
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,160
I'll take a grilled cheese,
Popeye.

161
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:10,421
You'll take squirrel.

162
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,650
Grilled cheese on rye,
you old fuck.

163
00:12:14,745 --> 00:12:15,445
Fuck!

164
00:12:32,158 --> 00:12:32,858
Hey, Jerri,

165
00:12:33,707 --> 00:12:35,747
there's a little man
at the door.

166
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,517
What the hell do you want?

167
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,296
Oh, Christ.

168
00:12:45,441 --> 00:12:47,541
Doesn't she know
I'm busy up here?

169
00:12:47,913 --> 00:12:49,533
She knows I'm busy up here.

170
00:12:52,328 --> 00:12:53,348
Is that a midget?

171
00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:55,501
She really doesn't give a shit.

172
00:12:59,991 --> 00:13:02,091
She can't leave me alone,
can she?

173
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:04,762
She can't leave me alone.

174
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:12,829
Take it, take it, take it.
Get out.

175
00:13:13,284 --> 00:13:14,364
Oh, and by the way

176
00:13:15,072 --> 00:13:17,403
you tell your old man
I'm tired of waiting.

177
00:13:17,404 --> 00:13:19,984
Enough is enough,
I want my goddamn money.

178
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:22,848
Get out.
Go, go, go, go, go.

179
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:27,806
Mike?

180
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:30,643
- Yeah?
- I saw Allyson.

181
00:13:31,057 --> 00:13:31,757
She's here?

182
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,045
- Yeah, I saw her here.
- Where?

183
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,140
She's with Jim Darcey and them.

184
00:13:41,164 --> 00:13:41,864
See you.

185
00:13:51,153 --> 00:13:51,894
What?

186
00:13:52,455 --> 00:13:53,605
He likes her now.

187
00:13:54,789 --> 00:13:55,629
- Oh, I dunno.

188
00:13:56,391 --> 00:13:58,791
- I hate her.
Hate all them rich girls.

189
00:13:59,531 --> 00:14:00,359
Me too.

190
00:14:00,648 --> 00:14:01,695
Rich bitches.

191
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,048
She got nice titties, though.

192
00:14:10,206 --> 00:14:12,966
- She does have nice titties.
- Yeah, I know.

193
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:18,178
You look nice.

194
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:20,105
Thanks.

195
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:28,367
Hey!

196
00:14:30,038 --> 00:14:31,358
What do you want?
Where's Ray?

197
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:32,726
Where's Ray?

198
00:14:33,947 --> 00:14:34,907
He's over there.

199
00:14:36,385 --> 00:14:37,945
We're gonna play foosball.

200
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,517
What are you wearing,
aftershave?

201
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,220
No.

202
00:14:42,725 --> 00:14:45,125
My mom cooked sausage.
Maybe that's it.

203
00:14:45,308 --> 00:14:47,828
- What kind of sausage?
- Summer sausage.

204
00:14:48,204 --> 00:14:50,424
- I love summer sausage.
- Oh, yeah.

205
00:14:50,952 --> 00:14:52,152
Now get out of here.

206
00:14:57,767 --> 00:14:58,487
Who is that?

207
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,766
Uh...,
that was my little brother.

208
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,610
Joe.

209
00:15:04,289 --> 00:15:05,129
How old is he?

210
00:15:06,152 --> 00:15:06,872
Uh..., he's,

211
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:09,488
a year younger than me.

212
00:15:11,465 --> 00:15:12,425
He's so scrawny.

213
00:15:14,286 --> 00:15:15,246
And his clothes.

214
00:15:16,653 --> 00:15:17,353
What?

215
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,898
He looks like a little hobo.

216
00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:23,509
Our washer is busted.

217
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,190
Can I talk to her?

218
00:15:35,952 --> 00:15:37,092
Which one you like?

219
00:15:37,658 --> 00:15:38,498
The short one.

220
00:15:39,754 --> 00:15:42,240
She's pretty cute,
she in eighth or ninth?

221
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:43,741
They held her back twice.

222
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:45,048
She's like 18.

223
00:15:45,766 --> 00:15:47,102
I dunno, Maybe 17.

224
00:15:48,056 --> 00:15:50,696
I thought we were gonna
play some foosball.

225
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,984
These fuckers are never
gonna let us play.

226
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,125
They will. Come on.

227
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,068
She does have splendid titties.

228
00:16:26,358 --> 00:16:27,678
Did you get a haircut?

229
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,820
Yeah, I got a little trim.

230
00:16:30,584 --> 00:16:31,904
Looks a little uneven.

231
00:16:34,986 --> 00:16:36,186
My mom cut it wrong.

232
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:40,089
You got a cigarette?

233
00:16:40,255 --> 00:16:41,815
You can't smoke over here.

234
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,220
Aw, let them arrest me.

235
00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:49,684
Let's dance.

236
00:16:56,987 --> 00:16:58,598
Look at this fucking asshole.

237
00:16:58,599 --> 00:16:59,299
I know.

238
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:10,788
Come on, there's foxes.

239
00:17:29,004 --> 00:17:29,964
What's he doing?

240
00:17:33,757 --> 00:17:35,617
- Disco dancing?
- I guess so.

241
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:38,722
He looks like some kind
of herky jerky fish.

242
00:17:44,754 --> 00:17:47,514
He looks like a puppet.
A puppet on a string.

243
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,960
Looks like he has palsy.

244
00:17:59,535 --> 00:18:02,059
Let's get the fuck out of here.
I can't stand to look at this.

245
00:18:02,084 --> 00:18:02,784
Let's go.

246
00:19:03,074 --> 00:19:03,840
- Hey.

247
00:19:04,117 --> 00:19:04,886
Hey.

248
00:19:05,581 --> 00:19:07,141
Get rid of that cigarette.

249
00:19:10,311 --> 00:19:11,331
What do you want?

250
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,680
How are you getting home?

251
00:19:14,866 --> 00:19:17,026
I'm getting a ride
with these guys.

252
00:19:18,343 --> 00:19:19,363
Can I come along?

253
00:19:20,351 --> 00:19:22,451
We're really
kind of full in here.

254
00:19:25,256 --> 00:19:25,956
Hey.

255
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:28,147
Where's Ray?

256
00:19:29,305 --> 00:19:30,265
He's over there.

257
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,950
How you gonna get home?

258
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:35,666
I guess we'll hitch.

259
00:19:37,337 --> 00:19:38,037
Hey, hey!

260
00:19:40,587 --> 00:19:43,078
Listen, I'd ask them
if you could come, but

261
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:45,179
we're really
kind of full in here.

262
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,800
Don't worry about it.

263
00:20:22,043 --> 00:20:25,463
Okay, everybody, number 4 is up,
number 4 in your books.

264
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,727
Do you have a number 4?
No, you don't have a number 4.

265
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:29,648
"Streets of Laredo" is number 4.

266
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:32,530
I know you don't like it.
I'm not crazy about it, either.

267
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,284
But it's music.
Express yourselves.

268
00:20:34,285 --> 00:20:36,805
Let's try to get
a little energy into it.

269
00:20:36,827 --> 00:20:38,747
Here's Joe.
"Hi Joe", everyone.

270
00:20:39,604 --> 00:20:41,839
He's here.
He's late, but he's here.

271
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,000
And he's gonna
look for his sticks,

272
00:20:44,713 --> 00:20:46,153
and they won't be there.

273
00:20:47,132 --> 00:20:48,632
They're not there, right?

274
00:20:50,972 --> 00:20:52,652
What did you do,
sell them?

275
00:20:53,864 --> 00:20:56,084
Go get your sticks,
"Mr. Forgetful!"

276
00:20:57,364 --> 00:20:58,324
"Mr. Forgetful!"

277
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:01,811
Look at the triplets,
Ta-Te-Ti,

278
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:04,773
Ta-Te-Ti, Ta-Te-Ti,
very sharp on the triplets.

279
00:21:05,705 --> 00:21:07,231
Joe, can I talk to you
for a sec?

280
00:21:07,357 --> 00:21:09,097
Horns up.
Everyone, tune up.

281
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:17,005
Your Dad is "Mr. Forgetful", too.
Do you know what I'm talking about?

282
00:21:17,006 --> 00:21:17,706
Quiet!

283
00:21:18,613 --> 00:21:20,653
I need my $300.
He owes it to me.

284
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,360
Now go talk to him for me,
will you?

285
00:21:24,438 --> 00:21:25,138
Will you?

286
00:21:26,204 --> 00:21:27,344
Go get your sticks.

287
00:21:28,924 --> 00:21:31,324
Everyone, horns up.
Concert A, tune up.

288
00:23:14,302 --> 00:23:16,522
- Hey, hey.
I want that fucking money.

289
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,929
I want the $40.
Give me the money.

290
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,031
- Now, wait a minute.
- Give me the money...

291
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:23,432
- Just hold on.
Not in front of my house.

292
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,437
- Give me the money, now!
I want the money, now!

293
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,739
Forty dollars. You said on Thursday,
it's fucking three Thursdays.

294
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,600
- I'll show you everything I got.

295
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:33,056
- Give me the money,
give me the money.

296
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,506
Give me the money.
C'mon, c'mon.

297
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:36,414
C'mon, nothing.

298
00:23:36,469 --> 00:23:38,869
When you say Thursday,
I want Thursday!

299
00:24:23,131 --> 00:24:24,151
You listen to me.

300
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,898
- When I ask you to do something,
you do it, right? - Right.

301
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,062
Make me chase you
down the fucking street.

302
00:24:30,063 --> 00:24:32,021
If I ask you to march out
on the street

303
00:24:32,022 --> 00:24:34,638
and jump up and down like
GI Joe, you do it, right? - Right.

304
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,515
If I ask you to go up to the roof
and bark like a chicken,

305
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,136
you do it, right?
- Right.

306
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:40,811
I don't give a fuck whether
he's your boss or whatever it is,

307
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,324
I'm your father and you do
exactly what I say. Look at me!

308
00:24:43,325 --> 00:24:44,405
- Right?
- Right.

309
00:24:44,695 --> 00:24:45,515
All right.

310
00:24:49,491 --> 00:24:50,571
What's for supper?

311
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:54,658
- She left spaghetti for you guys.
- What'd you say?

312
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,760
She's got leftover spaghetti
in the refrigerator.

313
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:59,281
Oh, that's it, that's it.
The fucking!

314
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:03,851
I'm home starving to death,
and I get two days old spaghetti?

315
00:25:04,933 --> 00:25:05,633
All right,

316
00:25:07,615 --> 00:25:08,755
here's what you do.

317
00:25:10,196 --> 00:25:11,298
Go down to uh,

318
00:25:11,805 --> 00:25:12,680
Durock's

319
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:15,813
get me chipped beef
and a loaf of white bread.

320
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,194
But I have to be at work
in a half an hour.

321
00:25:18,195 --> 00:25:19,695
Then you better haul ass.

322
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,720
Go!

323
00:25:24,203 --> 00:25:25,043
Hup, hup, hup!

324
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:33,509
And get me some cigarettes!

325
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:40,438
- Hey!

326
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,241
What's up?

327
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:45,769
- Not much.
- Where you going?

328
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,579
The store. Dad wants chipped beef.
Wanna take a walk?

329
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,649
I can't go. My mom's boyfriend
is taking us out to dinner.

330
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,384
Oh, boy.
Who's her boyfriend now?

331
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,705
Why are you concerned?

332
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,621
Seems like she got a new boyfriend
every time I turn the corner.

333
00:25:57,622 --> 00:26:00,891
Don't worry yourself about it.
Anyway, he's taking us out.

334
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,192
Where?
The Ponderosa?

335
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:03,661
Fuck you,
what's wrong with that?

336
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,963
You're just jealous,
you gotta eat chipped beef.

337
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:08,844
- Shut up and go home.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm going.

338
00:26:12,752 --> 00:26:14,672
Wanna come with me
to the store?

339
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,974
I can't, I gotta read
this thing for English.

340
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:18,595
Do it later, man.
Come on.

341
00:26:19,007 --> 00:26:19,707
Nah.

342
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,860
What's wrong?

343
00:26:24,448 --> 00:26:25,348
It's fucked up.

344
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,410
What?

345
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:29,659
People are so fucked up.

346
00:26:30,303 --> 00:26:31,003
Who?

347
00:26:32,235 --> 00:26:33,075
Orzo and them.

348
00:26:34,164 --> 00:26:34,864
Kenny Orzo?

349
00:26:36,042 --> 00:26:36,742
Yeah.

350
00:26:37,623 --> 00:26:38,323
Fucks.

351
00:26:38,483 --> 00:26:39,563
What did they say?

352
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:41,098
Shit about Dad.

353
00:26:43,432 --> 00:26:44,132
Yeah?

354
00:26:45,801 --> 00:26:48,658
Yeah. They heard I was working
that job cleaning after school.

355
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:49,359
- So?

356
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:53,321
So, he said, "Tell your old man
he taught you good."

357
00:26:53,346 --> 00:26:57,186
And that,"The two of us can come
and clean his toilet anytime."

358
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,830
So, I said, "Shut the fuck up,
you harelip bastard."

359
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,921
You said that?
You said the harelip?

360
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:05,623
Yeah, well, he's got
a fucking harelip.

361
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,764
What happened then?

362
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,089
He came at me to fight.

363
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,665
He said to meet him at Chesney Park,
tomorrow after school

364
00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:15,099
or, he'll come to my shack
and beat the shit outta me.

365
00:27:15,248 --> 00:27:15,948
Holy shit.

366
00:27:17,568 --> 00:27:19,608
So, basically,
I gotta fight him.

367
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,273
What are you, nuts?
He's a big, huge guy.

368
00:27:23,906 --> 00:27:24,866
I got no choice.

369
00:27:25,848 --> 00:27:28,815
You better be coming from
that store instead of just going.

370
00:27:28,816 --> 00:27:29,956
Hey, you better go.

371
00:27:30,807 --> 00:27:31,587
You hear me?!

372
00:27:32,129 --> 00:27:32,829
Yeah!

373
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:35,330
Here,

374
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:36,892
do me a favour

375
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:39,823
go get him his chipped beef.
I'm already late for work.

376
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,525
Hey, bring home some
of those frog legs tonight.

377
00:27:42,526 --> 00:27:43,226
- I'll try.

378
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,827
Ever wish you could
just disappear?

379
00:27:53,292 --> 00:27:55,572
Just disappear
off the fucking earth?

380
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:10,393
You better start
coming on time

381
00:28:10,394 --> 00:28:13,079
unless you want the lady
going off on you, man.

382
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,780
Fuck her.

383
00:28:14,238 --> 00:28:16,818
Oh, God, I feel like shit,
I swear to God.

384
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:22,166
I was doing some serious fucking
last night, man

385
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,607
I mean, serious fucking.

386
00:28:24,976 --> 00:28:26,176
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

387
00:28:26,494 --> 00:28:28,872
This Chinese chick.
You know. Oh, my God

388
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,708
I went to this Willie Colén
concert last night,

389
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,989
and I told her
I was Willie's cousin.

390
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,260
She ate it up, man.
And then I ate her up.

391
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:42,524
You know Chinese girls
have straight pussy hair?

392
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:44,555
- Huh? Did you know that?
- No, I didn't know that.

393
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,867
'Course you don't.
You don't know that, motherfucker.

394
00:28:46,868 --> 00:28:50,308
She had some big tits.
Ever seen the Chinese... oh, shit.

395
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:52,889
This is Roy's order,
four pounds of butter

396
00:28:52,928 --> 00:28:55,568
get the cheap kind,
and however many cases.

397
00:28:57,335 --> 00:29:00,604
- Okay.You need some Seagram's
and some Jack, too. Can I get that?

398
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:02,473
- Oh, go get a case.
- I'm going.

399
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:03,974
There's a pile of dishes
a mile high.

400
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:06,677
Get here on time,
or I'll dock your paycheck.

401
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:07,818
You pay me in cash.

402
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:11,099
Don't wise off, I'll throw
your ass out the window.

403
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:16,085
Fuck off,
everybody just fuck off.

404
00:29:33,311 --> 00:29:34,011
Fuck.

405
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,016
What happened?

406
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,332
- The old man went nuts.

407
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:52,316
What?

408
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,186
- He broke all her records.

409
00:30:57,952 --> 00:31:00,472
Just threw them
at the walls, one by one.

410
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,140
Smashing them over his knee
and shit.

411
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:09,186
All of them?

412
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:11,435
- Just about.

413
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,866
He asked her for cash,

414
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,455
she said she didn't have any.

415
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:30,164
He started going through her purse,
than all of a sudden,

416
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:34,369
he started screaming at her
and calling her a whore.

417
00:31:35,134 --> 00:31:36,274
He called her that?

418
00:31:37,822 --> 00:31:39,142
I couldn't believe it.

419
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:41,850
Then what?

420
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:45,561
He started smacking her around.

421
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:50,994
He found rubbers.

422
00:31:56,065 --> 00:31:56,765
What?

423
00:31:58,844 --> 00:31:59,624
In her purse.

424
00:32:11,067 --> 00:32:11,847
Where is she?

425
00:32:14,169 --> 00:32:15,069
In the kitchen.

426
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:28,879
I can't believe he broke
all her records.

427
00:33:14,573 --> 00:33:15,533
Come on with me.

428
00:33:33,852 --> 00:33:34,552
How is it?

429
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:37,757
Good.

430
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,658
They put a lot of whipped cream
on it this time.

431
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:48,359
Want some?

432
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:06,499
You be a good boy, Joe.

433
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,906
Sorry about your records, Ma.

434
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:53,033
Late pass.

435
00:34:54,355 --> 00:34:55,055
Fuck!

436
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:58,295
Next time you are late,
you're expelled.

437
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:01,660
And today you report to Mr. Coles
during your study hall period.

438
00:35:01,661 --> 00:35:02,361
You got it?

439
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:10,205
Overslept?
Give me a break.

440
00:35:45,628 --> 00:35:46,528
Are you, uh...?

441
00:35:48,182 --> 00:35:50,282
You must be uh Joe, uh,
Joe Henry.

442
00:35:52,592 --> 00:35:53,372
Joseph Henry.

443
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:54,979
Yeah.

444
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:58,066
All right, great.
I'm your guidance counsellor.

445
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:00,696
I'm Len Coles.
You can call me uh Len,

446
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:02,805
or Coles, or Mr. Coles.

447
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,161
Are you related to Jack Coles?

448
00:36:08,094 --> 00:36:09,534
Yeah I'm, he's my uncle.

449
00:36:11,248 --> 00:36:12,568
I see the resemblance.

450
00:36:13,831 --> 00:36:17,197
My old man used to work for him
at Prescott School for a while.

451
00:36:17,198 --> 00:36:17,978
That's funny.

452
00:36:20,794 --> 00:36:22,579
So I'm supposed to talk to you
about this whole tardiness.

453
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,540
"One-Eyed Jack!"

454
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:24,815
What?

455
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:27,684
That's what my old man
used to call him.

456
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,385
Huh.

457
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:31,321
On account he was hit in the eye
playing fast pitch.

458
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:34,682
Had to wear a patch over his eye,
looked like a pirate.

459
00:36:34,695 --> 00:36:36,015
Real nice fella, Jack.

460
00:36:36,364 --> 00:36:37,144
Yeah, he was.

461
00:36:38,027 --> 00:36:40,801
Hey, if you ever see him,
tell him Joe the King says "hello."

462
00:36:40,802 --> 00:36:41,582
He'll get it.

463
00:36:43,096 --> 00:36:43,796
He's dead.

464
00:36:47,022 --> 00:36:49,182
This whole tardiness thing,
I mean,

465
00:36:50,281 --> 00:36:51,721
it's a lot of tardiness.

466
00:36:54,601 --> 00:36:56,328
Yeah, I mean,
54 times?

467
00:36:59,241 --> 00:37:02,961
You know, maybe you should try
to get to bed a little sooner.

468
00:37:04,809 --> 00:37:05,509
Well...

469
00:37:07,229 --> 00:37:10,649
you got any work you can do?
Some homework or something?

470
00:37:11,149 --> 00:37:11,849
All right.

471
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,230
I got some uh, here.

472
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,014
This is good.

473
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:20,639
Take a look,
look at this, all right?

474
00:37:23,715 --> 00:37:25,515
I'll be back in a few minutes.

475
00:37:25,629 --> 00:37:26,329
- All right.

476
00:39:22,088 --> 00:39:23,348
These look like gold.

477
00:39:24,264 --> 00:39:24,964
Lemme see.

478
00:39:31,734 --> 00:39:32,874
This definitely is.

479
00:39:33,952 --> 00:39:35,872
Give me some more whipped cream.

480
00:39:38,488 --> 00:39:40,648
I'll pawn these
for a pretty penny.

481
00:39:58,764 --> 00:39:59,464
Where from?

482
00:40:00,381 --> 00:40:02,061
- Found them.
- Found them?

483
00:40:02,428 --> 00:40:03,695
Yeah, that's what I said.

484
00:40:03,696 --> 00:40:06,396
Yeah, my ass, you found them.
Put that down.

485
00:40:07,911 --> 00:40:08,611
How much?

486
00:40:09,164 --> 00:40:10,621
Two hundred for the three.

487
00:40:10,622 --> 00:40:12,872
One hundred for the three.
That's as high as I'll go.

488
00:40:12,873 --> 00:40:13,573
One fifty.

489
00:40:14,006 --> 00:40:17,360
These rings are hot.
You're lucky I don't call the cops.

490
00:40:17,361 --> 00:40:18,561
Give me the hundred.

491
00:40:26,004 --> 00:40:27,144
Thanks for nothing.

492
00:40:27,223 --> 00:40:28,766
Take a hike, you little crook.

493
00:40:28,767 --> 00:40:30,207
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

494
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:33,416
- Suck my dick.
- Suck my dick.

495
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,788
What I don't have,
I can get in a week.

496
00:40:44,789 --> 00:40:46,940
I got the Nancy Wilson,
the Billy Eckstine,

497
00:40:46,941 --> 00:40:48,830
the Joe Williams
and the Chuck Jackson.

498
00:40:48,831 --> 00:40:52,052
I have two of the Brook Benton's,
the other three I have at home.

499
00:40:52,053 --> 00:40:54,393
A lot of the Johnny Ray stuff
is uh...

500
00:40:55,211 --> 00:40:57,011
kinda hard to find,
you know.

501
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,620
It..., it all depends on how much
you got to spend.

502
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:01,864
Money is no object.

503
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,046
Now you're speaking my language.

504
00:41:04,575 --> 00:41:05,775
Could I bum a smoke?

505
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:11,310
I'll see you in a few days.

506
00:41:25,603 --> 00:41:26,443
Joe, Joe, Joe.

507
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,640
- Did you see Mike?
- No, why?

508
00:41:29,864 --> 00:41:31,856
- Orzo's looking for him.
- The harelip's looking for him.

509
00:41:31,857 --> 00:41:33,339
- Is he gonna fight him?
- Where is he?

510
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:36,100
- Upstairs in the room, cleaning.
- Aw, shit!

511
00:41:39,974 --> 00:41:41,444
You don't fuck
with the harelip.

512
00:41:41,445 --> 00:41:43,396
- Mike's been running
from the harelip all week.

513
00:41:43,397 --> 00:41:45,814
- I ain't afraid of that big dumb
fucking harelip bastard.

514
00:41:45,815 --> 00:41:48,436
- Fuck you. He'll have you
screaming like a little girl.

515
00:41:48,437 --> 00:41:49,937
- You're a fucking idiot!

516
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:06,623
Hey!

517
00:42:11,372 --> 00:42:14,312
You ain't gonna fight
that fucking guy, are you?

518
00:42:31,365 --> 00:42:34,159
Maybe you should go talk to him
and tell him you're sorry.

519
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,240
Yeah, "I'm sorry."

520
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:37,607
Are you a fucking idiot?

521
00:43:11,357 --> 00:43:14,111
Come on, Mike, let's just go home.
It's just stupid. You can't beat him.

522
00:43:14,112 --> 00:43:15,912
Stop talking about it,
okay?!

523
00:43:16,131 --> 00:43:19,311
I'm going to fight this fucking guy,
like it or not.

524
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:27,904
I've known this guy
since I was 6 years old.

525
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:29,372
What kind of cruel shit is that?

526
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:32,475
Standing there with a fucking mop
and pail, making $2.25 an hour,

527
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:34,210
and you want me to say,
"I'm sorry!?"

528
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:35,531
I won't say I'm sorry!

529
00:43:41,247 --> 00:43:42,867
I'm not gonna come.

530
00:43:49,796 --> 00:43:51,476
Please,
let's just go home!

531
00:44:03,242 --> 00:44:05,461
I try to tell you something.

532
00:44:05,462 --> 00:44:06,787
- Shut up!
Shut up!

533
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,340
Oh, no.

534
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,693
I was running back.

535
00:45:25,582 --> 00:45:27,262
I got nothing to say to you.

536
00:45:27,944 --> 00:45:29,084
I was running back!

537
00:45:30,865 --> 00:45:32,425
Got nothing to say to you.

538
00:45:59,127 --> 00:46:00,027
<i>The price of oil.</i>

539
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:25,293
What the fuck
is going on there?

540
00:46:25,635 --> 00:46:26,335
- Nothing.

541
00:46:27,321 --> 00:46:28,341
Go back to sleep.

542
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:33,328
Where the hell have you been?

543
00:46:34,107 --> 00:46:35,976
- Work. Where do you think
I've been?

544
00:46:35,977 --> 00:46:36,937
Don't mouth off.

545
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:39,462
Hear me?

546
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:41,123
- What?

547
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:44,170
I said, "Don't mouth off!"
You hear me?!

548
00:46:47,011 --> 00:46:47,711
Yeah, yeah!

549
00:47:02,144 --> 00:47:02,844
You stink.

550
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,040
I smell your fucking shoes
from here.

551
00:47:13,125 --> 00:47:16,425
I want you to take those,
I told you a thousand times,

552
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:20,550
and throw them
in the fucking trash.

553
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:24,783
Why don't you buy me
some new ones?

554
00:47:25,601 --> 00:47:28,241
You're the big man,
you're the working man.

555
00:47:36,111 --> 00:47:37,791
Yeah,
you know what I make?

556
00:47:38,036 --> 00:47:41,276
Why don't you tell me about it,
big man, working man?

557
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,452
You don't wanna know.

558
00:47:44,234 --> 00:47:48,134
How much you take in tonight?
Let me see your wallet. Come here.

559
00:47:48,435 --> 00:47:50,115
Why,
you wanna borrow some?

560
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:53,920
Are you through?

561
00:47:57,105 --> 00:47:57,805
Come on.

562
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:01,024
You finished?

563
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:09,886
Every time I turn the corner, it's
"When's your old man gonna pay me?"

564
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,654
And "Tell your old man
I better get my money."

565
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:13,695
Brazer, Jerry,
and everyone else.

566
00:48:14,154 --> 00:48:16,629
You owe them, so pay them,
and get them off my back.

567
00:48:16,949 --> 00:48:17,649
Argh!

568
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,279
Argh.

569
00:48:52,023 --> 00:48:53,103
You don't tell me,

570
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:54,950
I tell you.

571
00:49:00,051 --> 00:49:02,811
Get yourself some shoes.
You look like a bum.

572
00:49:22,383 --> 00:49:23,283
Get me a drink.

573
00:49:23,898 --> 00:49:25,158
Seagram's and a Coke.

574
00:50:23,074 --> 00:50:24,817
- What's with this toilet?

575
00:50:27,363 --> 00:50:28,683
Who broke the toilet!?

576
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:43,059
That's very nice, very nice.
Looks nice.

577
00:50:43,497 --> 00:50:46,797
What are you standing around for?
Go wash your dishes.

578
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:18,141
Tada!

579
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:24,865
Frog legs,
just like you like them.

580
00:51:24,866 --> 00:51:27,779
Let me tell you, it wasn't easy.
They're watching me like a hawk.

581
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,340
And if that wasn't enough,

582
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:30,987
apple pie.

583
00:52:05,585 --> 00:52:06,285
Jokes, huh?

584
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:12,419
What you ought to be doing
is studying for the regents.

585
00:52:12,455 --> 00:52:13,475
The math regents?

586
00:52:14,144 --> 00:52:14,844
Fuck math.

587
00:52:17,093 --> 00:52:18,473
That's a nice attitude.

588
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:19,720
Very nice.

589
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:23,978
Someday you're gonna have
to balance a check book, you know?

590
00:52:24,709 --> 00:52:26,089
You think that's funny?

591
00:52:26,227 --> 00:52:28,687
You're gonna need math
when you grow up.

592
00:52:31,421 --> 00:52:33,761
You're so full of shit,
you know that?

593
00:52:34,177 --> 00:52:37,117
Huh? I don't buy it.
You come in here every day,

594
00:52:37,466 --> 00:52:38,786
you don't have a book,

595
00:52:39,376 --> 00:52:40,576
you look like a bum.

596
00:52:42,336 --> 00:52:44,916
What are you gonna do
with your life, huh?

597
00:52:53,695 --> 00:52:54,655
Read your jokes.

598
00:53:14,644 --> 00:53:16,144
Hey, you wanna ride home?

599
00:53:16,992 --> 00:53:18,312
Nah, I'm not done yet.

600
00:53:19,906 --> 00:53:23,866
Fuck it, man. The bitch is gone
with her husband for the weekend.

601
00:53:24,697 --> 00:53:25,777
- Oh yeah?
- Yup.

602
00:53:28,532 --> 00:53:29,492
Where'd they go?

603
00:53:31,818 --> 00:53:35,658
Where it is that stupid, ugly,
white people go for the weekend.

604
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:38,133
Hey, no offense, okay?

605
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:45,672
Just make sure you tell Roy
when you're done, all right?

606
00:53:45,999 --> 00:53:49,091
That stupid bastard.
Catch you on the rebound, all right?

607
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:49,792
Catch you.

608
00:54:42,147 --> 00:54:42,847
Argh!

609
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:06,502
Fuck!

610
00:55:06,605 --> 00:55:07,608
What the fuck.

611
00:55:10,172 --> 00:55:10,872
Oh, no...

612
00:55:11,647 --> 00:55:12,967
my fucking house keys.

613
00:55:15,284 --> 00:55:15,984
Oh...

614
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:17,230
fuck!

615
00:55:32,593 --> 00:55:33,853
Where the fuck is it?

616
00:55:54,035 --> 00:55:54,735
Damn it!

617
00:55:56,145 --> 00:55:56,845
Mary?

618
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:24,247
Argh.

619
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,440
What the fuck
is the window open for?

620
00:56:33,893 --> 00:56:34,593
Fuck!

621
00:56:36,122 --> 00:56:36,962
What the fuck?

622
00:56:40,872 --> 00:56:41,637
Jesus.

623
00:56:42,374 --> 00:56:43,074
Shit.

624
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:45,134
- Oh, God he kills me...

625
00:57:24,762 --> 00:57:25,462
Aw.

626
00:57:28,484 --> 00:57:29,184
Aw.

627
00:57:34,064 --> 00:57:34,764
Aw.

628
00:57:38,852 --> 00:57:39,552
Aw.

629
00:57:53,336 --> 00:57:54,836
You know what time it is?

630
00:57:55,985 --> 00:57:58,325
I had to work, Ma.
I had to shut down.

631
00:57:58,443 --> 00:58:00,709
God, Joe, how many times
do I have to tell you

632
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:03,142
to call if you're gonna be late?
How many times?

633
00:58:03,237 --> 00:58:04,737
I had to clean the fryer.

634
00:58:05,433 --> 00:58:07,516
Why is your brother
sleeping in the closet?

635
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:08,385
I don't know.

636
00:58:08,386 --> 00:58:12,166
Yeah, I bet you don't, coming home
in the middle of the night.

637
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,220
Night, Ma.

638
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:15,560
Joe, I'm telling you.

639
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:18,600
The police show up here
one more time,

640
00:58:18,702 --> 00:58:19,662
I'm telling you.

641
00:58:20,498 --> 00:58:21,198
Night, Ma.

642
00:58:36,342 --> 00:58:38,142
Cut my ankle real bad at work.

643
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:41,669
Turn out the fucking light.

644
00:58:44,112 --> 00:58:45,732
C'mon back in, man, please?

645
00:58:46,632 --> 00:58:48,672
Don't sleep on the floor,
please?

646
00:59:29,724 --> 00:59:30,984
What happened to you?

647
00:59:32,088 --> 00:59:33,228
Cut myself at work.

648
00:59:37,755 --> 00:59:38,455
Shit.

649
00:59:40,374 --> 00:59:41,874
Why aren't you in school?

650
00:59:43,093 --> 00:59:44,533
- It's Saturday.
- Uhm.

651
00:59:57,661 --> 00:59:58,361
Ugh!

652
01:00:39,006 --> 01:00:39,726
Is Ray home?

653
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:41,610
No.

654
01:00:43,083 --> 01:00:43,783
Ray?

655
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:48,515
You're not going nowhere.
You hear me?

656
01:00:48,532 --> 01:00:50,514
Yeah, I hear you!
Go back inside, will you?

657
01:00:50,515 --> 01:00:52,748
I told you to clean up that shit,
now get in here!

658
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:55,183
- Fuck off!
- Fuck off you, you little brat!

659
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:56,885
You're embarrassing yourself
in front of the whole neighbourhood!

660
01:00:56,886 --> 01:00:59,166
- Now, get out!
- Have another drink.

661
01:01:00,844 --> 01:01:02,491
Oh, shit.
Where'd you get that?

662
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:03,932
Heist at the restaurant.

663
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,780
- That's a shitload of cash.
- Check this out.

664
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:10,364
Aw, shit, that looks bad.
How'd that happen?

665
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,160
- Cut myself during the heist.
- Oh man.

666
01:01:13,649 --> 01:01:15,989
Get in here, Ray!
- I gotta go.

667
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:19,519
Don't say nothing to nobody.
- I won't.

668
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:21,998
- You swear? - Yeah.
- Goddamn bastard!

669
01:01:21,999 --> 01:01:23,859
- Say it, dickweed.
- I swear.

670
01:01:25,823 --> 01:01:28,059
- I told you
to clean that room,

671
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:30,700
now get in there,
you little piece of shit!

672
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:32,690
Will you shut the fuck up?!

673
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:38,480
- Hey,
let me tell you, cochise

674
01:01:38,481 --> 01:01:40,262
you're getting
an excellent deal.

675
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:42,003
These are all mint condition.

676
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:43,831
Look at this.
Rare shit.

677
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:46,318
I appreciate it.

678
01:01:47,136 --> 01:01:48,816
Whoo!
You'll love it, baby!

679
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,180
Have it,

680
01:01:51,754 --> 01:01:52,454
salve it,

681
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:53,993
dig it.

682
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:38,273
What's this?

683
01:02:38,805 --> 01:02:40,605
The money my old man owes you.

684
01:02:57,806 --> 01:02:58,506
What's up?

685
01:03:02,824 --> 01:03:04,384
Get any action last night?

686
01:03:19,213 --> 01:03:20,353
Better get to work.

687
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:23,070
The hell you are.
Come here.

688
01:03:25,101 --> 01:03:26,241
Let me talk to you.

689
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:32,174
You're a lucky young man.
I'm gonna tell you why.

690
01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:35,210
First, you're lucky
that I was spending quality time

691
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:38,691
with some respectable types,
including my parole officer.

692
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,269
What are you talking about?

693
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:43,451
What the fuck
don't jive me, man.

694
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:46,021
Secondly, you're lucky the old man
had enough Seagram's in him

695
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:48,461
so he didn't die when he fell
down the steps. Number three

696
01:03:48,462 --> 01:03:51,131
you're lucky I don't fucking bust
you ass up and turn you in there

697
01:03:51,132 --> 01:03:53,328
for breaking and entering,
you hear me?

698
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:54,767
I, I don't know what
you're talking about.

699
01:03:54,768 --> 01:03:57,228
Go home and shut
the fuck up, all right?

700
01:03:57,508 --> 01:03:59,801
The lady don't want to see you
without working papers

701
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:02,202
so get the hell out of here,
all right?

702
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,620
Do they know it was me?

703
01:04:04,198 --> 01:04:07,798
They think it's Mary's ex-husband,
so don't worry about it.

704
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:10,124
They asked the old man,

705
01:04:10,464 --> 01:04:12,144
he thought it was a big rat.

706
01:04:12,214 --> 01:04:15,175
He thought that you looked
like a big fucking rat.

707
01:04:16,874 --> 01:04:19,214
What the fuck
you laughing at, stupid?

708
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:21,790
Hey!

709
01:04:23,267 --> 01:04:25,727
I didn't meant to get you
in no trouble.

710
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:28,614
Don't sweat it.
Be cool, all right?

711
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:29,695
Just be cool, man.

712
01:05:10,589 --> 01:05:11,289
Len?

713
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:13,715
Lenny?

714
01:05:14,388 --> 01:05:15,109
- Uh-huh.

715
01:05:17,077 --> 01:05:18,457
What does "pithy" mean?

716
01:05:20,098 --> 01:05:21,298
How do you spell it?

717
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:23,637
P-I ... T-H...

718
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,732
What's wrong with your leg,
man?

719
01:05:26,733 --> 01:05:28,893
Why do you keep
scratching at that?

720
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:30,058
Let me see.

721
01:05:34,359 --> 01:05:35,059
Ugh.

722
01:05:35,584 --> 01:05:36,284
Ugh.

723
01:05:37,427 --> 01:05:38,507
How'd that happen?

724
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:40,135
I fell.

725
01:05:40,638 --> 01:05:41,958
It's a hell of a fall.

726
01:05:43,076 --> 01:05:43,950
Better come.

727
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:48,300
We gotta get that looked at.
We'll get you an excuse for the day.

728
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:50,045
Pithy, huh?

729
01:05:51,423 --> 01:05:52,623
P... pith...
Pithy?

730
01:05:55,676 --> 01:05:57,356
I don't know.
Don't ask me.

731
01:06:00,948 --> 01:06:02,508
Keep it clean and covered.

732
01:06:03,029 --> 01:06:05,549
I'm giving you some extra
gauze and tape.

733
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:11,197
It's a bit infected,
so I'm prescribing an antibiotic.

734
01:06:12,867 --> 01:06:14,165
Yeah, come on in!

735
01:06:16,793 --> 01:06:18,740
They called my name
over the loudspeakers?

736
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:20,841
That's right.
Raymond Dewy, right?

737
01:06:22,547 --> 01:06:23,627
Come on, sit down.

738
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:26,572
They, called my name
over the loudspeaker.

739
01:06:26,573 --> 01:06:27,773
Uh-huh.
Have a seat.

740
01:06:30,451 --> 01:06:31,881
Where's your mom!?

741
01:06:32,046 --> 01:06:33,306
Oh, she's in the car.

742
01:06:34,505 --> 01:06:36,845
Have her come up
so I can talk to her.

743
01:06:37,791 --> 01:06:38,491
She can't.

744
01:06:39,232 --> 01:06:40,132
Can't?
Why not?

745
01:06:41,259 --> 01:06:43,599
Well, she's afraid
to turn the car off

746
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:45,340
'cause of the transmission.

747
01:06:46,109 --> 01:06:48,029
But it's okay, I got it covered.

748
01:06:48,261 --> 01:06:51,804
It was a test and they called
my name over the loudspeaker,

749
01:06:51,805 --> 01:06:54,325
kin, kinda takes a guy
by surprise. Whoo!

750
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:56,690
Well, that was me.

751
01:06:58,401 --> 01:06:59,481
I wanted to, uh...

752
01:07:00,289 --> 01:07:02,650
talk to you about your friend,
Joe Henry?

753
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:05,556
You're friends with him, right?
- Oh, I don't know.

754
01:07:05,557 --> 01:07:06,457
You don't know?

755
01:07:08,164 --> 01:07:10,264
- Can I have one of those?
- Sure.

756
01:07:11,169 --> 01:07:13,689
Do you have any idea
how he hurt himself?

757
01:07:32,748 --> 01:07:35,568
I've been having trouble
contacting his folks.

758
01:07:35,609 --> 01:07:37,289
You're asking the wrong guy.

759
01:07:38,587 --> 01:07:40,327
I thought you two were tight.

760
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,558
He might have cut it off.

761
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:45,227
I'm sorry?

762
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:49,215
Might have cut off the phone.
Maybe that's it.

763
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:52,398
Look, you're barking
up the wrong tree here.

764
01:08:00,571 --> 01:08:01,297
Raymond,

765
01:08:02,434 --> 01:08:04,114
I'm just a little concerned.

766
01:08:05,985 --> 01:08:07,920
He might have
hurt himself at work.

767
01:08:07,921 --> 01:08:08,621
At work?

768
01:08:09,632 --> 01:08:11,886
At the restaurant.
You didn't hear it from me.

769
01:08:11,887 --> 01:08:12,847
What restaurant?

770
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:17,492
Mmm, I don't know, it's at Schautz.
It's a greasy spoon, bar place.

771
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:18,793
He washes dishes there.

772
01:08:18,794 --> 01:08:21,194
- How do you spell it?
S-C-H... - Whoa!

773
01:08:21,997 --> 01:08:24,097
Don't ask me how to spell,
mister.

774
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:30,939
Hello.

775
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:33,341
Hello.
Is this Schautz restaurant?

776
01:08:33,342 --> 01:08:35,127
<i>Yes, it is.
Who am I speaking to, please?</i>

777
01:08:35,128 --> 01:08:37,307
Uh..., well, could I speak
to the manager?

778
01:08:37,308 --> 01:08:38,028
Who is this?

779
01:08:38,627 --> 01:08:43,088
<i>This is Len Coles. I'm Joe Henry's
guidance counsellor at Lincoln Central.</i>

780
01:08:43,089 --> 01:08:45,309
- It's the kid's teacher.
- Hang up.

781
01:08:47,247 --> 01:08:48,714
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hello.

782
01:08:48,715 --> 01:08:50,035
What can I do for you?

783
01:08:50,222 --> 01:08:53,027
<i>Do you employ Joe Henry
in your kitchen?</i>

784
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:56,231
I do, but he's not working no more,
we're cutting back.

785
01:08:56,232 --> 01:08:58,392
- Hang up!
Oh Goddammit! Goddammit!

786
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:01,002
I knew I was gonna get screwed
by that little cocksucker.

787
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:03,103
Will you shut up!
Shut up, shut up!

788
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:12,680
<i>- I did not know he was 14
years old. Nobody told me that.</i>

789
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:14,616
Well, I'm telling you now,
all right?

790
01:09:14,617 --> 01:09:17,252
<i>And I haven't contacted his
parents yet, but when I do</i>

791
01:09:17,253 --> 01:09:19,320
<i>I'm sure they're gonna
be very upset.</i>

792
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:22,290
Like I said, I don't know nothing
about the kid's leg or nothing.

793
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:23,750
<i>- All right.</i>
- Yes, sir, yes.

794
01:09:23,751 --> 01:09:25,994
And I hope he doesn't
work there anymore, if he does

795
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:28,029
the next call you'll be hearing
from is the police.

796
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:29,764
<i>- You understand?</i>
- Yes.

797
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:32,465
Can I just ask you something?
He cut his leg

798
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:35,703
and there was a lot of blood.
- I don't care if he cut his leg!

799
01:09:35,704 --> 01:09:37,939
<i>- It was a lot of
blood, a severe gash.</i>

800
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:40,542
- You're feeling sorry for him now?
- Yes, thank you.

801
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:41,243
Bye.

802
01:09:43,188 --> 01:09:46,008
- Who you calling?
- The cops. It was the kid.

803
01:09:46,907 --> 01:09:48,647
Mike, it's Joe.
Is Mom home?

804
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:50,721
<i>- What do you want?</i>

805
01:09:50,722 --> 01:09:52,887
Just thought I'd let her know
I'm on my way home.

806
01:09:52,888 --> 01:09:56,608
<i>She's at work, then she's going out.
What do you want?</i>

807
01:09:56,890 --> 01:09:58,893
- Is Dad around?
<i>- No, he's not around.</i>

808
01:09:58,894 --> 01:10:00,694
<i>What do you want?
I gotta go.</i>

809
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:03,717
- Where you going?
<i>- Jim Darcey's.</i>

810
01:10:04,266 --> 01:10:06,066
You,
you going for the night?

811
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:07,901
<i>- Yeah, what do you want?</i>

812
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:11,504
- Can I come?
<i>- Nah, I gotta go.</i>

813
01:10:11,555 --> 01:10:15,755
- I got some cash, you know.
<i>- No, you can't. I gotta go. Bye.</i>

814
01:10:15,778 --> 01:10:16,478
Wait, but.

815
01:10:56,772 --> 01:10:57,472
Hey.

816
01:10:58,136 --> 01:10:59,777
- Hey.
- What are you eating?

817
01:10:59,778 --> 01:11:00,478
These.

818
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:01,860
Can I have one?

819
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:04,759
Can I have a couple more?

820
01:11:05,784 --> 01:11:06,624
- Come on out.

821
01:11:07,408 --> 01:11:09,028
Can't, it's a school night.

822
01:11:09,938 --> 01:11:12,518
Come on! Sneak out.
Nobody is at my house.

823
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:14,902
I got cash.
We'll order some pizza.

824
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:17,303
Plus, the old bag
is in the front room.

825
01:11:17,567 --> 01:11:18,347
Yeah, I know.

826
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:21,400
Just wish this fucking window
opened more.

827
01:11:22,311 --> 01:11:23,391
Oh, well. See you.

828
01:11:24,831 --> 01:11:25,531
Hey!

829
01:11:26,309 --> 01:11:29,058
- Yeah? - I got called down
to the office today.

830
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:31,429
- Yeah?
- Get in here...!

831
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:33,470
- Aw, nothing.
I'll tell you later.

832
01:12:38,510 --> 01:12:39,210
Hello?

833
01:13:50,605 --> 01:13:51,625
Wh... who is it?!

834
01:13:51,767 --> 01:13:53,147
Open the door.
Police!

835
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,300
Joe Henry?

836
01:14:00,002 --> 01:14:03,302
Get your clothes on.
You're coming with us.  Let's go.

837
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:07,893
Look, buddy, there's still
no answer at your house.

838
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:09,536
No idea where she is, huh?

839
01:14:11,588 --> 01:14:14,228
It's 2:00 in the morning.
I'll keep trying.

840
01:14:14,514 --> 01:14:16,643
In the meantime,
I'm gonna bring a cot in here

841
01:14:16,644 --> 01:14:18,984
rather than put you
in the cell, okay?

842
01:14:19,738 --> 01:14:20,438
Okay.

843
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:58,330
I don't know what to do.
His father isn't around half the time.

844
01:15:01,446 --> 01:15:05,166
I work all day, I can't keep
an eye on him 24 hours. I can't.

845
01:15:09,511 --> 01:15:10,211
Well,

846
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:13,974
what do you suggest
I do with him?

847
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:24,670
It looks like the best thing
I can do for you,

848
01:15:26,005 --> 01:15:29,605
is to send you to the Jamesville
Juvenile Detention Center,

849
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:32,646
for the term of six months,

850
01:15:33,496 --> 01:15:34,216
to one year.

851
01:15:36,264 --> 01:15:37,704
I will allow you one day

852
01:15:38,154 --> 01:15:40,974
to put your affairs in order
with your family,

853
01:15:41,009 --> 01:15:43,049
after which,
you will report here

854
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:44,580
at 5:00 p.m.

855
01:15:46,316 --> 01:15:47,156
Any questions?

856
01:16:12,815 --> 01:16:15,515
I guess there's no school
for me today, huh?

857
01:16:41,796 --> 01:16:42,756
Where you going?

858
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:45,139
I'm going to school, Ma.

859
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:49,180
Where the hell is your father?
Why do I have to do this alone?

860
01:17:05,610 --> 01:17:07,590
We have to have him here at 5:00.

861
01:17:09,593 --> 01:17:11,633
I'll come home right after school.

862
01:18:07,050 --> 01:18:07,750
Aw.

863
01:18:08,039 --> 01:18:08,769
You okay?

864
01:18:10,208 --> 01:18:11,468
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

865
01:18:12,821 --> 01:18:14,021
No school today, eh?

866
01:18:16,263 --> 01:18:16,963
I quit.

867
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:33,261
Here you go.

868
01:18:34,861 --> 01:18:35,561
Apple pie,

869
01:18:36,944 --> 01:18:37,964
strawberry shake,

870
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:39,760
french fries,

871
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:42,530
cheeseburger,

872
01:18:44,453 --> 01:18:45,173
onion rings,

873
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:48,649
mashed potatoes.

874
01:18:52,013 --> 01:18:53,273
That's a lot of food.

875
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:54,960
Yes.

876
01:18:57,742 --> 01:18:58,442
Okay.

877
01:19:55,081 --> 01:19:58,741
I brought you a little extra gravy
for your mashed potatoes.

878
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:01,524
Can I have the check?

879
01:20:04,165 --> 01:20:04,865
You done?

880
01:20:06,107 --> 01:20:07,007
Yeah, I'm done.

881
01:20:48,461 --> 01:20:50,683
- Is that him?! Is that him?!

882
01:20:50,690 --> 01:20:51,851
Where were you?

883
01:20:54,387 --> 01:20:55,887
Where the hell were you?!

884
01:20:59,054 --> 01:20:59,754
Oh God.

885
01:21:10,832 --> 01:21:11,532
Joe?

886
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:19,310
Christ, Joe, you know where I have
to take you in less than an hour?

887
01:21:20,008 --> 01:21:20,708
Look at me.

888
01:21:37,626 --> 01:21:38,346
Yes, I know.

889
01:21:41,966 --> 01:21:44,246
I put some stuff
in that bag for you.

890
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:04,117
So you're gonna do some time.

891
01:23:08,586 --> 01:23:11,166
Stevie Wonder
could have seen that coming.

892
01:23:13,082 --> 01:23:14,342
Keep your nose clean,

893
01:23:15,606 --> 01:23:16,866
don't talk to nobody.

894
01:23:18,193 --> 01:23:18,913
You hear me?

895
01:23:23,898 --> 01:23:24,978
How's your mother?

896
01:23:26,746 --> 01:23:27,446
What?

897
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:32,788
How's your mother
taking the news?

898
01:23:33,608 --> 01:23:34,688
Not good, I guess.

899
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:37,331
How long you gotta do?

900
01:23:39,047 --> 01:23:41,079
They say six months
if I stay outta trouble.

901
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:42,520
Six months for stealing.

902
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:48,732
What did you need the money for?
Christ, I could have got you the money.

903
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:51,899
What the fuck you need money for?
You're 13 fucking years old.

904
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:52,600
14.

905
01:23:55,859 --> 01:23:58,139
You're not gonna see
15 at this rate.

906
01:24:05,868 --> 01:24:06,568
You scared?

907
01:24:10,494 --> 01:24:11,194
A little.

908
01:24:16,518 --> 01:24:19,319
How many times I tell you
about the stealing, Joe?

909
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:22,320
How many times did I tell you
about the stealing?

910
01:24:23,992 --> 01:24:25,072
I better get back.

911
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:29,949
I guess I'm not much
to give advice.

912
01:24:31,730 --> 01:24:32,690
No, I guess not.

913
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:35,100
"No, I guess not."

914
01:24:36,538 --> 01:24:39,358
But I, think about you
and your brother a lot.

915
01:24:44,879 --> 01:24:46,019
What I'm saying is,

916
01:24:53,064 --> 01:24:53,764
is,

917
01:24:54,910 --> 01:24:56,950
there's people
who do good, Joey,

918
01:24:58,253 --> 01:24:59,003
they have,

919
01:25:01,063 --> 01:25:01,763
family,

920
01:25:02,142 --> 01:25:02,842
job,

921
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:06,836
I had a job.

922
01:25:09,852 --> 01:25:11,532
Swept floors, made a living.

923
01:25:14,703 --> 01:25:16,083
I had a pension coming.

924
01:25:18,746 --> 01:25:19,446
I gotta go.

925
01:25:22,689 --> 01:25:23,829
What I'm saying is,

926
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:27,801
there are good people, Joey,

927
01:25:30,325 --> 01:25:32,485
and then,
there are people like me.

928
01:25:36,627 --> 01:25:37,647
Don't get caught,

929
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:42,595
on the wrong side
of that equation.

930
01:25:47,762 --> 01:25:49,142
That advice I can give.

931
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:52,346
I gotta go.

932
01:25:58,270 --> 01:25:58,970
Okay.

933
01:26:04,515 --> 01:26:05,655
I'll see you later.

934
01:26:36,591 --> 01:26:37,291
Hey!

935
01:26:38,973 --> 01:26:41,433
thanks for uh...
taking care of, Brazer.

936
01:26:42,339 --> 01:26:43,299
I appreciate it.

937
01:26:43,831 --> 01:26:44,731
You're welcome.

938
01:26:50,905 --> 01:26:53,665
Thought I told you
to get rid of those shoes.

939
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:56,730
I'll get around to it.

940
01:27:02,116 --> 01:27:04,218
C'mon, get in the car,
I'll take you home.

941
01:27:04,375 --> 01:27:05,575
Nah, I'll walk back.

942
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:11,258
Okay.
I'll see you.

943
01:27:14,862 --> 01:27:15,562
Love you.

944
01:28:10,652 --> 01:28:12,092
What did he have to say?

945
01:28:13,988 --> 01:28:14,768
Nothing much.

946
01:28:18,438 --> 01:28:21,258
So, he's still driving
that big piece of shit.

947
01:28:21,992 --> 01:28:22,692
Yup.

948
01:28:29,237 --> 01:28:30,677
Sorry about the harelip.

949
01:28:31,105 --> 01:28:33,236
- Forget about that now.
- No, I should have been there.

950
01:28:33,237 --> 01:28:35,354
Forget about it.
It was my own fault

951
01:28:35,355 --> 01:28:38,096
for tangling with that big
fucking guy in the first place.

952
01:28:38,097 --> 01:28:39,777
I know what you're thinking.

953
01:28:40,723 --> 01:28:41,863
It wasn't my fault.

954
01:28:43,685 --> 01:28:44,885
Joe, I swear to God.

955
01:28:45,386 --> 01:28:48,188
You swear to God. You always say that
even when I know you're lying.

956
01:28:48,189 --> 01:28:50,390
Don't mean nothing.
- Joe, I swear on my mother.

957
01:28:50,391 --> 01:28:51,891
Yeah, now we believe you.

958
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:54,601
I just told that headshrinker guy,
you know,

959
01:28:54,602 --> 01:28:56,701
Mr. Coles, that you might
a got hurt at work.

960
01:28:56,702 --> 01:28:59,462
I mean, I didn't mean nothing.
- Yeah, right.

961
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:03,864
- Come on.

962
01:29:13,790 --> 01:29:15,050
Can I have your bike?

963
01:29:18,419 --> 01:29:19,499
Get your own bike.

964
01:29:40,105 --> 01:29:41,225
- Joe Henry?

965
01:29:42,117 --> 01:29:43,944
You wanna sign over here
for me, please?

966
01:29:43,945 --> 01:29:45,925
Right there.
Wanna come with me?

967
01:29:46,447 --> 01:29:47,467
Give me your bag.

968
01:29:56,090 --> 01:29:57,470
I'll give you a minute.

969
01:29:59,994 --> 01:30:01,134
See you in a while.

970
01:30:20,235 --> 01:30:21,555
Take care of yourself.

971
01:30:23,432 --> 01:30:24,132
You, too.

972
01:30:36,312 --> 01:30:37,609
I'll be up soon.

973
01:30:44,772 --> 01:30:47,592
I left something for you
underneath the porch.

974
01:30:48,576 --> 01:30:51,156
- I'm gonna have to take him now.

975
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:56,107
Come over here for me, please.
Put your arms across the bus.

976
01:30:56,884 --> 01:30:58,624
Move your legs apart, please.

977
01:31:15,002 --> 01:31:15,702
Oh, Jesus.

978
01:40:27,055 --> 01:40:27,755
The End

979
01:40:28,011 --> 01:40:32,011
