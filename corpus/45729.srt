1
00:02:53,787 --> 00:02:55,220
Doc...

2
00:02:55,255 --> 00:02:57,450
those pills you gave me
for my back,

3
00:02:57,491 --> 00:02:59,550
I'm not sure that they work.

4
00:02:59,593 --> 00:03:00,992
Well, I'm not sure either,

5
00:03:01,027 --> 00:03:02,722
but you don't
hear me complain.

6
00:03:02,762 --> 00:03:05,287
Step by the office

7
00:03:05,332 --> 00:03:06,492
at the end of the afternoon.

8
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:07,898
Thanks, Doc.

9
00:03:08,835 --> 00:03:10,462
They're kidding, right?

10
00:03:10,504 --> 00:03:13,098
No, they're not kidding.
This is your movie.

11
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:15,164
This is small town America.

12
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:18,041
The town in New Hampshire
was small town America, too.

13
00:03:18,078 --> 00:03:20,171
$40,000 a day
to shoot on the street

14
00:03:20,213 --> 00:03:21,202
and then
they kick us out.

15
00:03:21,248 --> 00:03:23,341
That's life
in the movie business.

16
00:03:23,383 --> 00:03:25,214
But look here--

17
00:03:25,252 --> 00:03:26,583
a jacket for $5.

18
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,144
I could buy this
whole town for 50 bucks.

19
00:03:28,188 --> 00:03:29,780
You told me that
about the last town.

20
00:03:29,823 --> 00:03:31,256
Yeah, but they never
shot a movie here.

21
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,452
I'm bleeding, Bill.
I'm bleeding.

22
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:34,619
Why am I here?

23
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:37,459
What do they got
to pass for the old mill?

24
00:03:37,497 --> 00:03:38,486
There you go.

25
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:39,658
The Waterford Mill.

26
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:42,327
Built in 1 825.
A longtime tourist attraction.

27
00:03:43,803 --> 00:03:45,771
Wake up, Umberto.

28
00:03:48,141 --> 00:03:49,472
We're here.

29
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:51,340
- Where are we?
- Give him a cigarette.

30
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:53,437
They send the old mill
from New Hampshire?

31
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,345
They're holding
our old mill for ransom.

32
00:03:55,382 --> 00:03:57,077
- We build one.
- They got one.

33
00:03:57,117 --> 00:03:59,017
We build a fire hut.

34
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:03,988
Okay, but we have to
lose the window.

35
00:04:04,024 --> 00:04:05,753
We can't lose the window.

36
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:07,783
Then I can't
do the shot, Wally...

37
00:04:07,827 --> 00:04:10,227
You want me to push in
through the window.

38
00:04:10,263 --> 00:04:11,560
Look.

39
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:14,032
I can't push in
through the window.

40
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:16,126
We go back
to New Hampshire, eh?

41
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:18,034
No, we can't ever
go back to New Hampshire.

42
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:20,198
No, we're going to
stay here.

43
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,832
This is what
my people die for--

44
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:24,810
the right to make a movie
in this town.

45
00:04:26,446 --> 00:04:28,812
What was wrong
with the old traffic light?

46
00:04:28,848 --> 00:04:30,179
I'm glad you asked.

47
00:04:30,216 --> 00:04:31,376
I'll tell you
what was wrong with it,

48
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:33,943
it was behind the times.

49
00:04:33,987 --> 00:04:36,012
- Good morning, darling.
- Morning.

50
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:37,580
You want to bring
business to this town,

51
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:39,592
you have to plan
for a Waterford

52
00:04:39,626 --> 00:04:42,390
that does not exist.
Not at this moment, no.

53
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:44,021
You have to live
in the present, folks.

54
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:46,055
You can not live
in the past.

55
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:47,760
Good morning.

56
00:04:47,801 --> 00:04:49,359
- Hi, Annie.
- Hi, Carla.

57
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:52,803
I'm going to be a little late
for the rehearsal tonight.

58
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,636
It's okay, Maude.
Do you know your lines?

59
00:04:54,674 --> 00:04:56,107
I know them.

60
00:04:56,142 --> 00:04:57,541
I don't know
what order they come in.

61
00:04:57,577 --> 00:04:59,408
We'll work it out.

62
00:04:59,446 --> 00:05:02,847
Now, what shall we have
that's good to eat?

63
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:05,316
- What are they on about?
- Traffic light.

64
00:05:05,352 --> 00:05:06,319
Jack's right.

65
00:05:06,353 --> 00:05:08,617
Public office
is a public trust.

66
00:05:08,655 --> 00:05:10,145
This is why
this is America.

67
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,214
That's right.

68
00:05:11,257 --> 00:05:13,157
The question is
who owns the street?

69
00:05:13,193 --> 00:05:14,820
That is the question.

70
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:33,812
Lots of room.

71
00:05:33,847 --> 00:05:35,371
Uh huh.

72
00:05:37,684 --> 00:05:39,345
Marty!

73
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:41,115
We got a new town.

74
00:05:41,154 --> 00:05:43,520
Yeah, it's a--
Where are we again?

75
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:44,989
Waterford, Vermont.

76
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:47,152
Waterford, Vermont.

77
00:05:47,193 --> 00:05:48,125
It's--

78
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:49,651
Where is it?

79
00:05:49,696 --> 00:05:51,630
That's where it is?

80
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:53,826
Here, talk to Bill.

81
00:05:53,867 --> 00:05:55,698
You have got to get me
Main Street for nothing.

82
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:57,202
I will.

83
00:05:57,237 --> 00:06:00,263
Marty, Bill.

84
00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:02,001
Okay, put her on.

85
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:03,009
Yup.

86
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:04,533
Kathy,

87
00:06:04,577 --> 00:06:06,044
stand by.

88
00:06:09,182 --> 00:06:12,879
Everyone goes
to Waterford, Vermont.

89
00:06:15,655 --> 00:06:18,385
Well, look on
a bigger map.

90
00:06:18,425 --> 00:06:19,517
God, she makes
me cranky.

91
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:21,151
May I help you?

92
00:06:21,194 --> 00:06:23,822
Yeah, I'd like to speak
to the manager.

93
00:06:23,863 --> 00:06:26,229
Would you like
a room?

94
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:29,030
No, we want to rent
the whole hotel.

95
00:06:33,106 --> 00:06:34,505
Because.

96
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:36,668
Because we don't
have to build an old mill.

97
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,678
They have an old mill.

98
00:06:38,712 --> 00:06:41,146
Yeah, it's on a stream.

99
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:42,148
That's where you put
an old mill.

100
00:06:42,182 --> 00:06:44,150
- They run on water.
- Uh huh.

101
00:06:44,184 --> 00:06:45,446
Okay, I'm looking at--

102
00:06:45,485 --> 00:06:47,009
I've got scene 1 2.

103
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:48,281
Come in.

104
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:50,812
Uh huh.
Thank you.

105
00:06:50,857 --> 00:06:52,916
Shouldn't you be
in school?

106
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,392
It's night.

107
00:06:55,528 --> 00:06:58,759
Scene 1 2,
the arrival at the mill.

108
00:06:58,798 --> 00:07:00,698
All right, work it out
and get back to me.

109
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:01,792
Mr. Price?

110
00:07:01,835 --> 00:07:03,530
What?

111
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:04,901
What is it?
We're working.

112
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:08,740
“Bring it in on time
and there's more

113
00:07:08,775 --> 00:07:10,242
where these came from.
Marty.

114
00:07:10,276 --> 00:07:13,473
P.S., I want to talk to you
about a product tie-in.”

115
00:07:13,513 --> 00:07:14,639
Somebody make a note.

116
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:16,672
I want for the broad--
What does she like?

117
00:07:16,716 --> 00:07:18,047
Lilacs.

118
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:20,712
A truckload of lilacs
when the broad comes.

119
00:07:20,754 --> 00:07:22,745
And get something
for Bob Barrenger.

120
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:24,381
Get him--
What does he like?

121
00:07:24,424 --> 00:07:26,483
Bob Barrenger? Bob Barrenger
is in this movie?

122
00:07:26,526 --> 00:07:28,323
- That's correct.
- He's staying here?

123
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:29,726
Put something in his room.
What does he like?

124
00:07:29,763 --> 00:07:31,458
1 4-year-old girls.

125
00:07:31,498 --> 00:07:32,863
Well, get him
something else.

126
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:35,333
Let's try to get out
of this town in one piece.

127
00:07:35,368 --> 00:07:38,064
Get him half
a 28-year-old girl.

128
00:07:38,104 --> 00:07:39,833
How's my math?

129
00:07:41,107 --> 00:07:43,940
Woman:
Who wanted these storyboards?

130
00:07:43,977 --> 00:07:45,205
Bill:
Sound department said

131
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:48,043
there's no hold up
on the KMR-81.

132
00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:50,811
Two of the caterers
are down with botulism.

133
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,284
And Umberto tells me
he can't take this shot

134
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:55,310
unless they let him
take out the Firehouse window.

135
00:07:55,355 --> 00:07:57,255
I need my lucky pillow.

136
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,587
I need to talk to you
about her nude scene.

137
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:00,422
I need that permit
to shoot on Main Street.

138
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,859
I need to speak
to the mayor.

139
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:03,658
- Well, speak to him.
- We can't find him.

140
00:08:03,696 --> 00:08:04,822
Are you ever in school?

141
00:08:04,864 --> 00:08:06,491
There are other things
to be learned.

142
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:07,522
Is that true?
Like what?

143
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:08,932
Like the mayor's here.

144
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:11,129
- What's his name?
- Mr. Bailey.

145
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:14,004
- Hi, Mr. Bailey.
- You've got to do these again.

146
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,007
Okay.

147
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,508
Mr. Bailey.

148
00:08:16,543 --> 00:08:19,068
Mr. Bailey, Walt Price.

149
00:08:19,112 --> 00:08:20,136
I'm going to be
your director.

150
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,306
I lost my typewriter.

151
00:08:21,347 --> 00:08:24,043
I have to tell you,
I can not express to you

152
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,881
- how happy--
- We're glad to have you here.

153
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,582
No phone calls.
I'm with the mayor.

154
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:31,385
Yes, can I speak
to my wife, please?

155
00:08:32,992 --> 00:08:34,220
This isn't our firehouse.

156
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,125
No, that's a firehouse
in New Hampshire.

157
00:08:36,162 --> 00:08:37,891
Why did you
leave New Hampshire?

158
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:39,398
Would you like a cigar?

159
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:40,990
Aren't these illegal?

160
00:08:41,034 --> 00:08:42,433
Why would they
be illegal?

161
00:08:42,468 --> 00:08:45,562
Well, the trade embargo
against Cuba.

162
00:08:45,605 --> 00:08:48,005
Nobody tells me anything.

163
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,736
Well, you know, uh...

164
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:53,171
I'd like to say that

165
00:08:53,213 --> 00:08:54,475
anything I can do--

166
00:08:54,514 --> 00:08:57,108
That's very kind of you.
As a matter of fact,

167
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,412
I'd hate to bother you
with this...

168
00:08:58,451 --> 00:09:00,817
We need a shooting permit
for Main Street.

169
00:09:00,854 --> 00:09:03,049
Whatever you need.

170
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:05,319
Uh, the city council,
of course, will have to--

171
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:06,347
The city council.

172
00:09:06,392 --> 00:09:08,622
--will have to pass
on your permit.

173
00:09:08,661 --> 00:09:10,094
But that's less than
a formality.

174
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:11,118
It is?

175
00:09:11,164 --> 00:09:13,689
I am the city council.

176
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:16,497
Well, Mr. Mayor,
that's very kind of you.

177
00:09:16,536 --> 00:09:18,504
My wife would like
to invite you

178
00:09:18,538 --> 00:09:21,769
to have dinner with us
at our home.

179
00:09:21,808 --> 00:09:23,639
And I hate to be
a pain about this--

180
00:09:23,676 --> 00:09:27,237
Oh, I would be delighted,
are you kidding me?

181
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,908
Well, well, I won't
take more of your time.

182
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:31,576
No, not at all.

183
00:09:31,618 --> 00:09:33,677
I can't imagine
the responsibility--

184
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,381
Actually I can imagine
because

185
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:38,254
once I had to video my
grandniece's confirmation...

186
00:09:39,292 --> 00:09:41,453
Walt, it's Marty
on the coast.

187
00:09:41,494 --> 00:09:43,553
We'll see you
Tuesday for dinner.

188
00:09:43,596 --> 00:09:46,326
It was one of the great,
great pleasures meeting you.

189
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:47,765
Thank you.

190
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,631
Bye bye.

191
00:09:51,204 --> 00:09:53,138
I found
your lucky pillow.

192
00:09:54,807 --> 00:09:56,934
It's Marty on the coast.

193
00:09:56,976 --> 00:09:58,102
Of course
he's on the coast.

194
00:09:58,144 --> 00:09:59,509
Where's he going to be,
the Hauge?

195
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:01,773
What?

196
00:10:01,814 --> 00:10:03,475
Marty, hi?

197
00:10:03,516 --> 00:10:05,541
The new town's cheaper
than the old town.

198
00:10:05,585 --> 00:10:07,678
We're going to save
a fortune.

199
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,712
Because? Because we don't
have to rebuild the old mill.

200
00:10:10,757 --> 00:10:14,659
They've got an old mill.
They've got a firehouse--

201
00:10:14,694 --> 00:10:16,321
Baby, baby, baby,

202
00:10:16,362 --> 00:10:19,695
I want to save the money
just as much as you do.

203
00:10:19,732 --> 00:10:22,292
Just put it on the end
of the counter there.

204
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,895
Right on the counter.

205
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:26,428
Whoa? Whoa whoa whoa?

206
00:10:26,472 --> 00:10:27,996
You wiped out the board?

207
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,509
Dinner with the mayor.
Write it big.

208
00:10:30,543 --> 00:10:32,841
That's just what we need,
to miss dinner with the mayor.

209
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:35,677
Marty, we've got to talk
about this schedule.

210
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:37,808
I got to have an extra day
on the dead horse gag.

211
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,713
I'm serious.

212
00:10:40,753 --> 00:10:41,947
No, it gets worse.

213
00:10:41,988 --> 00:10:43,819
I need another half day
on the old mill pond.

214
00:10:43,856 --> 00:10:46,689
We can't shoot
in the old mill.

215
00:10:47,794 --> 00:10:50,763
Marty, uh...
call me back in two minutes.

216
00:10:50,797 --> 00:10:52,458
We can't shoot
in the old mill.

217
00:10:52,498 --> 00:10:55,194
I just talked to the mayor.
He told me anything we need.

218
00:10:55,234 --> 00:10:57,794
- It burnt down.
- When did it burn down?

219
00:10:57,837 --> 00:10:59,828
1 960.

220
00:11:01,674 --> 00:11:03,869
Part of a spate
of suspicious fires.

221
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,673
The old mill--

222
00:11:05,712 --> 00:11:07,270
You told me they had
an old mill.

223
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,007
by a disturbed teenager,
were in fact the inspiration

224
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,644
for the Waterford Huskies.”

225
00:11:13,686 --> 00:11:14,846
Hi.

226
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:17,788
Does it have to be an old mill?
Where have you been?

227
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:20,292
I was in New Hampshire.
I was at the old location.

228
00:11:20,326 --> 00:11:21,816
We can't shoot
the old mill.

229
00:11:24,831 --> 00:11:27,095
You know, they told me
there were going to be jokes.

230
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:28,498
Kid the new guy.

231
00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:29,626
That's not quite it.

232
00:11:29,669 --> 00:11:31,534
The old mill burned down.

233
00:11:33,206 --> 00:11:35,936
Can't you build
the old mill?

234
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:37,135
We're out of money.

235
00:11:37,176 --> 00:11:39,076
You built the old mill
in New Hampshire.

236
00:11:39,112 --> 00:11:41,740
They're holding
the old mill for ransom.

237
00:11:41,781 --> 00:11:43,146
Oh.

238
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:46,817
Why did we have to
leave New Hampshire?

239
00:11:53,292 --> 00:11:55,351
Hello, Marty.

240
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:57,955
What would they have used
instead of an old mill?

241
00:11:57,997 --> 00:11:59,157
I need it tonight.

242
00:11:59,198 --> 00:12:00,722
Yeah, Marty,
you were saying?

243
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:02,132
I can't write it.

244
00:12:02,168 --> 00:12:03,294
Why?

245
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:04,633
I lost my typewriter.

246
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,604
Get Mr. White a typewriter.

247
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,436
I can only write on manual.

248
00:12:08,474 --> 00:12:10,066
I know the feeling.

249
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:12,009
Typewriter for Mr. White?

250
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:14,673
You know, that's a lie.

251
00:12:14,714 --> 00:12:17,239
- That's a real fault.
- It's not a lie.

252
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:19,410
It's a gift for fiction.

253
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:21,884
Off you go.

254
00:12:23,723 --> 00:12:25,691
Bill.

255
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,522
How big is this horse?

256
00:12:28,561 --> 00:12:29,653
1 5 halves.

257
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:31,993
What is that in fingers?

258
00:12:32,031 --> 00:12:34,499
Just kidding.
Get me this horse.

259
00:12:34,534 --> 00:12:35,762
That horse is booked.

260
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:37,326
Tell the guy--
Get me this horse?

261
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,632
Tell the guy...

262
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:40,662
I'll give him
an Associate Producer credit.

263
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:53,847
I'll give the horse
an Associate Producer credit.

264
00:12:56,022 --> 00:12:57,546
Put a VHS,
an air conditioner

265
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,057
and a refrigerator
in that room,

266
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:00,491
she's gonna blow.

267
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:03,324
The labor with the first child
can sometimes be prolonged.

268
00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:06,229
What's an Associate
Producer credit?

269
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:08,233
It's what you give
to your secretary

270
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:09,825
instead of a raise.

271
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:11,268
This isn't Evian water.

272
00:13:11,304 --> 00:13:12,635
It's water.

273
00:13:12,672 --> 00:13:13,468
Can't sign for it, sorry.

274
00:13:13,506 --> 00:13:14,734
She's going to blow.

275
00:13:14,774 --> 00:13:16,071
Well, you rewire.

276
00:13:16,109 --> 00:13:18,703
I rewire it, I have
to tear out half the wall.

277
00:13:19,979 --> 00:13:22,140
I'm looking
for my typewriter.

278
00:13:22,181 --> 00:13:25,173
- Bill, I found lilacs.
- Put them in her room.

279
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:28,278
Tommy, you got to send
somebody running

280
00:13:28,321 --> 00:13:29,481
for a new dead horse.

281
00:13:29,522 --> 00:13:31,046
Did they find
my typewriter?

282
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,921
- Bob! Bob!
- Oh, my God.

283
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,154
Mr. Barrenger, Mr. Barrenger!

284
00:13:35,194 --> 00:13:37,219
I told you, all of you.
Get back, get back.

285
00:13:37,263 --> 00:13:38,787
This man is a guest here.

286
00:13:40,099 --> 00:13:41,088
Hi, I'm uh...

287
00:13:41,134 --> 00:13:42,226
Oh, sir, I know
who you are.

288
00:13:42,268 --> 00:13:43,599
...Bob Barrenger.
I'm with the movie.

289
00:13:43,636 --> 00:13:45,433
Sir, we're so...
We're so--

290
00:13:45,471 --> 00:13:46,802
Front!

291
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,103
I've seen--
I know everybody says this,

292
00:13:49,142 --> 00:13:52,339
but I've seen
every one of your movies.

293
00:13:52,378 --> 00:13:54,073
Show Mr. Barrenger
to his room.

294
00:13:54,113 --> 00:13:56,081
Your room is 21 4
through 1 7.

295
00:13:56,115 --> 00:13:57,241
I'm Scott Larkin.

296
00:13:57,283 --> 00:13:59,717
Anything you need,
this is my private line.

297
00:13:59,752 --> 00:14:00,912
Oh, thank you
very much, Scottie.

298
00:14:00,953 --> 00:14:02,545
I'm just here to do
a job like the rest--

299
00:14:02,588 --> 00:14:05,489
- Hey, Bob!
- Hey, Tommy.

300
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:07,152
I heard your wife's
having a baby.

301
00:14:07,193 --> 00:14:08,160
Do they know
who the father is?

302
00:14:08,194 --> 00:14:09,491
They think
it's your first wife.

303
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:10,553
Oh, that could be.

304
00:14:11,764 --> 00:14:13,356
Now get out of here.

305
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:16,568
I'm going to get
you a list

306
00:14:16,602 --> 00:14:18,001
of Mr. Barrenger's
dietary requirements.

307
00:14:18,037 --> 00:14:19,834
- Mr. Barrenger!
- Chuckie, not today.

308
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:21,203
Mr. Barrenger
has just arrived.

309
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,969
Oh, that's all right.

310
00:14:24,243 --> 00:14:25,437
Chuckie.

311
00:14:25,478 --> 00:14:27,378
How do you
spell that, son?

312
00:14:27,413 --> 00:14:29,347
With an “ie”?

313
00:14:29,382 --> 00:14:31,373
Chuck, what are
your hobbies?

314
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:33,214
Baseball?

315
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:35,482
Baseball?

316
00:14:35,521 --> 00:14:36,749
Chuckie...

317
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,055
that's the national sport.

318
00:14:44,997 --> 00:14:46,191
Thank you.

319
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:48,932
Here you go, Dad.

320
00:14:50,036 --> 00:14:51,936
Man: I'll tell you what else.
In the land of freedom

321
00:14:51,971 --> 00:14:53,905
we get to choose
what we have for breakfast.

322
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,999
You think that's nothing?
Go live under communism.

323
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:58,135
Here's your bowl of kasha.
Eat it and shut up.

324
00:14:58,177 --> 00:15:01,010
Vanilla frappé,
two tuna BLTs,

325
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:02,674
What's a tuna BLT?

326
00:15:02,715 --> 00:15:04,307
It's for
the movie people.

327
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,183
Well, I for one am glad
of a little diversion

328
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,653
and I'm glad
they're here.

329
00:15:08,688 --> 00:15:09,382
What I'm saying is,

330
00:15:09,422 --> 00:15:11,287
we have to look out
for our own.

331
00:15:11,324 --> 00:15:13,087
They want to close
down Main Street.

332
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,285
You want to talk
about Main Street,

333
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:15,954
why don't you fix
the pot hole?

334
00:15:15,995 --> 00:15:17,622
Doug, it's--
what, three days?

335
00:15:17,663 --> 00:15:18,960
Three, four days?

336
00:15:18,998 --> 00:15:20,329
You know what
we're gonna have?

337
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:22,459
A record of our
wonderful life.

338
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:23,900
Why don't you stick

339
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:25,233
to the amateur theatricals?

340
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:27,432
This is not quite
the same thing, you see.

341
00:15:27,473 --> 00:15:29,065
This is big business

342
00:15:29,108 --> 00:15:31,804
in which our life
is no less a commodity than--

343
00:15:31,844 --> 00:15:33,209
Help me out here.

344
00:15:33,246 --> 00:15:34,736
Woman: Water or mineral deposits?

345
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,975
Well, that's what I'm saying.

346
00:15:37,016 --> 00:15:38,142
I think that they're nice.

347
00:15:38,184 --> 00:15:39,811
I'm sure they are.

348
00:15:39,852 --> 00:15:41,342
As nice as they are...

349
00:15:41,387 --> 00:15:43,753
they should be thankful
they can choose their breakfast.

350
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:46,189
Why? Because they don't
live under communism.

351
00:15:46,225 --> 00:15:47,351
Communism's over.

352
00:15:47,393 --> 00:15:50,191
That's what they said
about Warner Brothers in 1 985.

353
00:15:50,229 --> 00:15:52,561
But if you look at their
price per share today...

354
00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:55,032
Well, hard to argue
with that.

355
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:57,627
Dad, I've got to go to
Terry's house to study tonight.

356
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,796
I want you home by 9:00.

357
00:16:01,073 --> 00:16:02,904
I want to tell you something.

358
00:16:02,942 --> 00:16:05,706
You stay soft all your life,
people will despise you.

359
00:16:05,745 --> 00:16:07,212
It awakens adverse in them.

360
00:16:07,246 --> 00:16:08,577
They take advantage of you.

361
00:16:08,614 --> 00:16:10,241
And that's human nature.

362
00:16:12,084 --> 00:16:13,244
Oh, are you going to be
home tonight?

363
00:16:13,286 --> 00:16:15,151
I might have something
important to tell you.

364
00:16:15,187 --> 00:16:16,449
What is it,
a surprise?

365
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:18,354
That's right.

366
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:23,789
She could have
done better than him.

367
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:25,387
It takes all kinds.

368
00:16:25,431 --> 00:16:26,762
That's what
it takes?

369
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:29,359
I always wondered
what it took.

370
00:16:35,174 --> 00:16:36,801
Excuse me.

371
00:16:36,842 --> 00:16:40,334
Your sign says
you'd be back at 2:00.

372
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:41,903
It's a quarter
to 3:00.

373
00:16:41,947 --> 00:16:43,778
Oh.
Uh...

374
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,787
You doing a play?

375
00:16:55,828 --> 00:16:58,296
Local drama group.

376
00:16:58,331 --> 00:16:59,457
Northern Books.

377
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,527
No, it hasn't come in yet.

378
00:17:02,568 --> 00:17:04,331
As soon as it does.

379
00:17:05,404 --> 00:17:06,632
You too, Marge.

380
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:12,670
A little, small town, I suppose
you have to make your own fun.

381
00:17:12,712 --> 00:17:14,339
Everybody makes
their own fun.

382
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,813
If you don't make it yourself
it ain't fun,

383
00:17:15,848 --> 00:17:18,544
it's entertainment.

384
00:17:18,584 --> 00:17:21,212
See my point?
Northern Books.

385
00:17:21,253 --> 00:17:22,550
What can I do for you?

386
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:24,488
I need a typewriter.

387
00:17:24,523 --> 00:17:25,353
We got them.

388
00:17:25,391 --> 00:17:27,325
North--
No,

389
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,488
Henry James was the novelist,
Frank James was a criminal.

390
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:33,089
Yup, you came
to the right place.

391
00:17:33,132 --> 00:17:36,226
Jesse James
was the brother...

392
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:38,736
of the novelist,
that's right.

393
00:17:38,771 --> 00:17:41,569
That's all right, Suzy.
See you tomorrow.

394
00:17:44,443 --> 00:17:46,377
Okay.

395
00:17:46,412 --> 00:17:47,538
I want to rent this one.

396
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,514
Why don't you buy it?
Only 40 bucks.

397
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:51,516
I had one,
but they lost it.

398
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,415
You buy this typewriter,

399
00:17:53,452 --> 00:17:54,749
I will get it
all spruced up for you,

400
00:17:54,787 --> 00:17:56,049
good as new.
Better than new

401
00:17:56,088 --> 00:17:57,350
because it has
some history.

402
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,914
The other one
had history, too.

403
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,391
I wrote my play on it.

404
00:18:00,426 --> 00:18:02,155
You wrote a play on it?
What play is that?

405
00:18:02,194 --> 00:18:03,126
You never heard of it.

406
00:18:03,162 --> 00:18:04,026
What's it called?

407
00:18:04,063 --> 00:18:06,156
“Anguish.”

408
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:09,565
“Anguish,”
by Joseph Turner White.

409
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:11,126
You're Joseph
Turner White?

410
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,071
- That's right.
- Good afternoon, Annie.

411
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:18,338
Girls, this man
wrote this play.

412
00:18:18,377 --> 00:18:19,469
Is that a fact?

413
00:18:19,512 --> 00:18:21,002
Well, is it a good play?

414
00:18:21,046 --> 00:18:23,344
Yes, Maude, it is.
It's a very good play.

415
00:18:23,382 --> 00:18:25,077
A very good play indeed.

416
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:27,981
What's he doing here?

417
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,214
What are you doing here?

418
00:18:29,255 --> 00:18:30,244
Writing the movie.

419
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:31,950
You're writing the movie?

420
00:18:31,991 --> 00:18:32,958
Yeah.

421
00:18:32,992 --> 00:18:34,425
What's it about?

422
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,860
It's about
the quest for purity.

423
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:43,200
Scene blah blah blah,
they meet.

424
00:18:43,235 --> 00:18:45,499
“Sister, I've just
come from a fire.

425
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:47,529
There are some things
I want to think out?”

426
00:18:47,573 --> 00:18:49,438
That's bad because?

427
00:18:49,475 --> 00:18:51,067
Because he wouldn't
say that.

428
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:53,044
Look, Sister,
I've just come from a fire.

429
00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:55,239
There are some things
I want to think out.

430
00:18:55,281 --> 00:18:57,306
Come on.
Come on.

431
00:18:57,349 --> 00:18:59,408
Leave me alone?
A gesture? All right?

432
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:00,441
What else?

433
00:19:00,486 --> 00:19:02,477
Page three.
“It's a nice evening.”

434
00:19:02,521 --> 00:19:03,681
I'm not gonna
say that,

435
00:19:03,722 --> 00:19:04,950
“It's a nice evening.”

436
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,924
- Yeah, okay.
- Come on.

437
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,085
Yeah? Come in?

438
00:19:09,662 --> 00:19:12,324
Joe?
You know Bob?

439
00:19:12,364 --> 00:19:13,888
I grew up
on your movies.

440
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:15,924
Do you mind if I don't
go through the usual bullshit

441
00:19:15,968 --> 00:19:17,435
about how much I loved it?

442
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,530
I mean, okay, fine,
but it's a motion picture.

443
00:19:20,573 --> 00:19:21,904
You're gonna
bore them to death.

444
00:19:21,941 --> 00:19:23,135
Come in?

445
00:19:25,845 --> 00:19:28,109
I brought your sandwich.

446
00:19:28,147 --> 00:19:29,375
Thanks, honey.

447
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:32,646
Next time bring two.
Save yourself a trip.

448
00:19:32,685 --> 00:19:35,916
The people came to see
a motion picture.

449
00:19:35,955 --> 00:19:36,683
Hold on.

450
00:19:36,722 --> 00:19:38,212
No, no,
you can go.

451
00:19:39,258 --> 00:19:40,589
Page five.

452
00:19:40,626 --> 00:19:42,560
The fucking horse dies.

453
00:19:42,595 --> 00:19:44,358
You know,
she could be in the movie.

454
00:19:44,396 --> 00:19:45,658
- She could.
- Oh, boy.

455
00:19:45,698 --> 00:19:46,995
She's got a good face.
She could be the doctor's--

456
00:19:47,032 --> 00:19:49,193
Why does it
have to be his wife?

457
00:19:49,235 --> 00:19:52,636
- It could be his, uh...
- Stick to business, will you?

458
00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:55,970
- Can we do that?
- You're absolutely right.

459
00:19:56,008 --> 00:19:58,772
You go start doing that stuff
in this town...

460
00:19:58,811 --> 00:20:00,745
Hey, everybody
needs a hobby.

461
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:02,440
Okay, look, page--

462
00:20:04,884 --> 00:20:06,078
Claire.

463
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,444
You know Bob Barrenger?

464
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:13,049
I just saw “ Desert Sun.”
I want to tell you...

465
00:20:13,092 --> 00:20:16,994
No, I was...
I was just learning on it.

466
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:18,963
How did you like working
with Richard Hill?

467
00:20:18,998 --> 00:20:21,489
I loved it.

468
00:20:23,469 --> 00:20:24,800
Joe White.

469
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,139
How can I thank you?

470
00:20:29,174 --> 00:20:31,904
How can I repay you
for this part?

471
00:20:31,944 --> 00:20:33,377
It's a...

472
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:34,777
What a...

473
00:20:34,813 --> 00:20:36,713
Thank you for this part.

474
00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:39,547
The first scene
at the old mill--

475
00:20:39,585 --> 00:20:43,385
Joe's been having some thoughts
about the old mill scene.

476
00:20:43,422 --> 00:20:45,322
What is there
to think about?

477
00:20:45,357 --> 00:20:46,881
The scene is perfect.

478
00:20:46,926 --> 00:20:48,257
I get to say--

479
00:20:48,294 --> 00:20:52,924
Yeah, but Joe's been--
He's been having a few thoughts.

480
00:20:52,965 --> 00:20:55,297
How many times
in your life

481
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:57,199
do you get
a speech like that?

482
00:20:57,236 --> 00:20:58,328
Yeah.

483
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:01,271
This scene is why
I'm doing the movie.

484
00:21:01,307 --> 00:21:02,865
Look at the mill, Frank.

485
00:21:02,908 --> 00:21:04,671
Look at the way
it goes around.

486
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,837
Half the time
the darn wheel's under water,

487
00:21:06,879 --> 00:21:09,074
but still
it rises up, Frank.

488
00:21:09,114 --> 00:21:10,547
It rises up

489
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:13,074
as high as it can go.

490
00:21:13,118 --> 00:21:14,244
Tsk.

491
00:21:18,724 --> 00:21:19,622
Yeah.

492
00:21:19,658 --> 00:21:22,149
Um, that's true.

493
00:21:22,194 --> 00:21:24,958
Joe, you want to, um--

494
00:21:24,997 --> 00:21:27,124
you want to tell Claire

495
00:21:27,166 --> 00:21:30,135
about the thoughts
you've been having

496
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:32,228
about the old mill scene?

497
00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:58,353
So young. So innocent.
So full of promise.

498
00:21:58,397 --> 00:22:00,456
I beg your pardon?

499
00:22:07,673 --> 00:22:10,233
I've got your typewriter.

500
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:11,902
I don't need it,
I quit.

501
00:22:11,944 --> 00:22:13,912
- You quit?
- Quit the movie.

502
00:22:13,946 --> 00:22:15,846
Why'd you quit?

503
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:17,815
Hey, why in the world
would you quit?

504
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,444
Why I quit
is not important,

505
00:22:20,486 --> 00:22:23,614
but thank you
for your help.

506
00:22:24,723 --> 00:22:26,281
Uh huh.

507
00:22:40,172 --> 00:22:42,037
Actually, I'm not sure
if I quit.

508
00:22:42,074 --> 00:22:43,564
I think I got fired.

509
00:22:43,609 --> 00:22:44,974
No.

510
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,808
I'm such a liar,
I never could tell the truth.

511
00:22:47,846 --> 00:22:49,336
Don't be hard
on yourself.

512
00:22:49,381 --> 00:22:52,680
But I just got
kicked off my first movie.

513
00:22:54,219 --> 00:22:56,619
Well, everybody
has reversals.

514
00:22:56,655 --> 00:22:58,418
If you were
never down,

515
00:22:58,457 --> 00:23:00,118
how would you know
when you were up?

516
00:23:01,126 --> 00:23:02,718
You have a gift
for words.

517
00:23:02,761 --> 00:23:04,456
It's in your play.

518
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:09,661
Oh.

519
00:23:11,136 --> 00:23:13,070
Evening, Annie.
See you at rehearsal.

520
00:23:13,105 --> 00:23:14,697
You know your line?

521
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,232
Rise. One need not bend the knee
before the throne of justice.

522
00:23:18,277 --> 00:23:19,869
Go, you Huskies.

523
00:23:19,912 --> 00:23:21,277
Go, you Huskies.

524
00:23:21,313 --> 00:23:23,406
He leaves the clothing
out all night?

525
00:23:23,449 --> 00:23:24,848
Yup.

526
00:23:24,883 --> 00:23:26,578
Isn't he afraid
it's going to get stolen?

527
00:23:26,618 --> 00:23:28,483
Ain't worth stealing.

528
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,987
Only thing in town
worth anything

529
00:23:30,022 --> 00:23:31,751
is that
stained glass window.

530
00:23:33,158 --> 00:23:37,026
Waterford historic
firehouse, 1851.

531
00:23:37,062 --> 00:23:38,962
Did you ever wonder
why the dalmatian

532
00:23:38,997 --> 00:23:40,396
is the symbol
of the firehouse?

533
00:23:40,432 --> 00:23:42,059
The first organized
fire department

534
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:43,966
was on the border
of Dalmatia and Sardinia

535
00:23:44,002 --> 00:23:45,936
in the year 642.

536
00:23:47,473 --> 00:23:48,906
That's why
the dalmatian?

537
00:23:48,941 --> 00:23:51,671
It was either that
or a sardine.

538
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:56,639
Morning, Bucky.

539
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,344
Here you go, pal.

540
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:02,715
You grew up here?

541
00:24:02,755 --> 00:24:05,883
Central High and matinees
at the Bijou Theater.

542
00:24:05,924 --> 00:24:08,256
- Nice town.
- Oh, yeah.

543
00:24:12,197 --> 00:24:13,892
Do you want
to talk about it?

544
00:24:17,736 --> 00:24:18,998
Uh uh.

545
00:24:23,108 --> 00:24:25,076
You see...

546
00:24:28,313 --> 00:24:31,476
the sanctity
of every day things.

547
00:24:31,517 --> 00:24:32,779
Every day things, yes.

548
00:24:32,818 --> 00:24:35,013
For example,

549
00:24:35,053 --> 00:24:37,021
the heat's coming
from a fire,

550
00:24:37,055 --> 00:24:39,080
and um--

551
00:24:39,124 --> 00:24:41,615
That's a fine house.

552
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,458
You know when you look at that
you know nice people live there.

553
00:24:44,496 --> 00:24:46,293
I live there.

554
00:24:46,331 --> 00:24:48,026
Really?

555
00:24:48,066 --> 00:24:49,658
The porch swing
and everything?

556
00:24:49,701 --> 00:24:51,430
Surest thing you know.

557
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,435
I don't mean
to impose, but...

558
00:24:58,577 --> 00:25:00,909
do you think we might...

559
00:25:00,946 --> 00:25:03,471
That's what
the swing's there for.

560
00:25:03,515 --> 00:25:05,176
That's what
the swing is there for?

561
00:25:05,217 --> 00:25:06,411
Uh huh.

562
00:25:06,451 --> 00:25:08,214
That's its purpose,
isn't it?

563
00:25:08,253 --> 00:25:09,686
I always thought so.

564
00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:22,526
It's such
a pleasant sound.

565
00:25:22,568 --> 00:25:24,001
Uh huh.

566
00:25:25,604 --> 00:25:28,801
Because it's...

567
00:25:28,841 --> 00:25:31,639
it's the simple things.

568
00:25:31,677 --> 00:25:33,042
Well, there you are.

569
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:37,213
And have I got
big news for you.

570
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:41,986
This is Joe White
and this is... this is...

571
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,011
uh uh...

572
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:48,919
my fiancé,
Doug Mc Kenzie.

573
00:25:48,961 --> 00:25:51,555
It's a pleasure.

574
00:25:51,597 --> 00:25:54,794
Guess who is this close
to a nomination to State Senate,

575
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:58,997
which is this close
to one step from Congress?

576
00:25:59,037 --> 00:26:01,505
Who?

577
00:26:10,716 --> 00:26:13,048
It was lovely
meeting--

578
00:26:13,085 --> 00:26:15,485
Mr. White
is working on the movie.

579
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,646
It's a pleasure
meeting you.

580
00:26:16,688 --> 00:26:18,713
- And we were just--
- Let me tell you,

581
00:26:18,757 --> 00:26:20,054
they were a bit
coy at first.

582
00:26:20,092 --> 00:26:22,117
I told them, look,
the people are tired.

583
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,787
They're going to vote
their pocket book, yes,

584
00:26:23,829 --> 00:26:25,694
but they're going
to vote their heart.

585
00:26:25,731 --> 00:26:26,925
How do I know?

586
00:26:26,965 --> 00:26:28,455
I'm out there
with them every day.

587
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,660
Go down
to the lumber mills,

588
00:26:29,701 --> 00:26:31,225
go down
to the truck stops

589
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,261
and you'll see people
of this great land

590
00:26:33,305 --> 00:26:35,899
working, playing,
moving...

591
00:27:03,335 --> 00:27:05,929
What happened in 1 975?

592
00:27:16,114 --> 00:27:17,547
The 1 9--

593
00:27:22,354 --> 00:27:25,016
Don't run off.

594
00:27:25,057 --> 00:27:27,890
Don't run off.
We need you.

595
00:27:27,926 --> 00:27:30,224
You know why?

596
00:27:30,262 --> 00:27:32,662
You're why we're here.

597
00:27:32,698 --> 00:27:34,996
Your script
is why we're here.

598
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:36,967
Big deal,
we fight a little bit.

599
00:27:37,002 --> 00:27:39,368
You show me
a family that doesn't.

600
00:27:39,404 --> 00:27:40,769
But we've got
something good here.

601
00:27:40,806 --> 00:27:42,831
You know what it is?

602
00:27:42,874 --> 00:27:46,037
We're here to make
a movie.

603
00:27:46,078 --> 00:27:47,568
We can't use
the old mill.

604
00:27:47,612 --> 00:27:50,206
That happens.
What you got to do,

605
00:27:50,248 --> 00:27:51,840
you've got to figure out
the essence.

606
00:27:51,883 --> 00:27:54,511
What is it
that brought us all here?

607
00:27:54,553 --> 00:27:57,579
It wasn't a building, Joe.

608
00:27:57,622 --> 00:27:59,283
It was an idea.

609
00:27:59,324 --> 00:28:01,087
What is the essence
of your story, Joe?

610
00:28:02,427 --> 00:28:05,294
It's about a man
who gets a second chance.

611
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:07,298
Then you write that.

612
00:28:07,332 --> 00:28:09,266
And then this is
our second chance.

613
00:28:09,301 --> 00:28:11,599
That's why
we're all here.

614
00:28:11,636 --> 00:28:13,331
I want to make
a good film.

615
00:28:13,372 --> 00:28:14,896
I know you do!

616
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:19,140
Maybe it will be
a better film

617
00:28:19,177 --> 00:28:20,269
without the old mill.

618
00:28:20,312 --> 00:28:22,337
Hey, it's with the gods.
We don't have the money.

619
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:24,542
We got to write it out,
the best or not.

620
00:28:25,817 --> 00:28:27,648
And that's a lesson.

621
00:28:27,686 --> 00:28:29,347
Did you get
your typewriter yet?

622
00:28:29,388 --> 00:28:30,650
No.

623
00:28:30,689 --> 00:28:32,179
Grace,

624
00:28:32,224 --> 00:28:33,213
get on the other phone.

625
00:28:33,258 --> 00:28:35,522
Get Mr. White
his typewriter.

626
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,721
Have what's her name send
up some nosh.

627
00:28:37,763 --> 00:28:38,923
What do you
like to drink?

628
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:42,092
- I don't drink,
- Did my matzos come?

629
00:28:42,134 --> 00:28:44,102
Get some for everybody.

630
00:28:44,136 --> 00:28:46,297
Thank you.

631
00:28:46,338 --> 00:28:48,306
Let me tell you
about my first picture.

632
00:29:09,995 --> 00:29:12,020
The chairs go.

633
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,658
- The lazyboy goes.
- Not the lazyboy.

634
00:29:14,699 --> 00:29:16,690
The lazyboy goes.

635
00:29:16,735 --> 00:29:18,396
Hi, Sherry.
Where do you want it?

636
00:29:18,437 --> 00:29:19,529
Put it in
the living room.

637
00:29:19,571 --> 00:29:21,266
And we have
13 at table.

638
00:29:21,306 --> 00:29:22,830
We don't have
13 at table.

639
00:29:22,874 --> 00:29:24,899
Bob Barrenger,
Claire Wellesley, the director--

640
00:29:24,943 --> 00:29:27,707
- Invite someone else then.
- I don't want to invite someone else.

641
00:29:27,746 --> 00:29:29,509
Because this is the most
exclusive dinner--

642
00:29:29,548 --> 00:29:32,073
Well, then you do
whatever makes you happy.

643
00:29:32,117 --> 00:29:34,085
I'll be back
with the butter churn.

644
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:36,087
And we need
a blunder buss.

645
00:29:36,121 --> 00:29:39,648
The woman's gone crazy
about this dinner party.

646
00:29:39,691 --> 00:29:41,420
George.

647
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,519
I want a city
council meeting.

648
00:29:43,562 --> 00:29:44,961
City council?

649
00:29:44,996 --> 00:29:47,328
Doug, the traffic light--

650
00:29:47,365 --> 00:29:48,559
Fuck the traffic light.

651
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,500
I'm talking about 3%
of the adjusted gross

652
00:29:50,535 --> 00:29:52,025
of a major motion picture.

653
00:29:54,739 --> 00:29:55,797
Hi.

654
00:29:55,841 --> 00:29:57,741
I love your script.

655
00:29:58,944 --> 00:30:01,435
- What?
- You're still here.

656
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,004
Morning, Annie.

657
00:30:03,048 --> 00:30:04,538
See you
at rehearsal tonight.

658
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:07,108
In the name of justice,
sir, I bid you pause,

659
00:30:07,152 --> 00:30:08,915
for she is our queen.

660
00:30:08,954 --> 00:30:10,080
That's very good.

661
00:30:10,122 --> 00:30:13,285
In fact, I'm not sure if
I gave them a second chance

662
00:30:13,325 --> 00:30:14,986
or if they're
giving it to me.

663
00:30:15,026 --> 00:30:18,086
That's the truth.
The truth's best, don't you think?

664
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,927
You'd know
better than me.

665
00:30:19,965 --> 00:30:21,557
How can you say that?

666
00:30:22,601 --> 00:30:24,034
It's in your script.

667
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:26,936
It's about getting
a second chance, isn't it?

668
00:30:26,972 --> 00:30:28,837
You can go back.

669
00:30:28,874 --> 00:30:32,469
But how do I...
how do I do a film

670
00:30:32,511 --> 00:30:35,969
called “The Old Mill”
when I don't have an old mill?

671
00:30:36,014 --> 00:30:38,312
Well, first you got
to change the title.

672
00:30:40,285 --> 00:30:41,809
No, he doesn't
want to work out

673
00:30:41,853 --> 00:30:43,718
with the Waterford Huskies.

674
00:30:43,755 --> 00:30:45,586
Because he's Bob Barrenger.

675
00:30:45,624 --> 00:30:47,319
Call his girl in Aspen.

676
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:48,587
Get her to ship his weights.

677
00:30:48,627 --> 00:30:49,924
There you go, sir.

678
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:52,930
Well, fine, then he's not
going to do the pond scene.

679
00:30:52,964 --> 00:30:55,489
Not unless he can work out.

680
00:30:55,534 --> 00:30:59,630
Call his girl in Aspen,
get her to ship the weights out.

681
00:30:59,671 --> 00:31:01,263
How much can they weigh?

682
00:31:01,306 --> 00:31:03,331
Walt, are these
the ones?

683
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:06,742
Yes. Who designed
these costumes?

684
00:31:06,778 --> 00:31:08,006
Who designed
these costumes?

685
00:31:08,046 --> 00:31:09,809
It looks like
Edith Head puked

686
00:31:09,848 --> 00:31:12,112
and that puke designed
these costumes.

687
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,879
- Get Courtney.
- Your wife's on the phone.

688
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,410
I have no wife?

689
00:31:16,454 --> 00:31:17,682
Okay.

690
00:31:19,491 --> 00:31:21,186
Tommy,

691
00:31:21,226 --> 00:31:23,160
we need a new name
for the movie.

692
00:31:23,195 --> 00:31:24,685
Where's the writer?

693
00:31:24,729 --> 00:31:25,696
Roger.

694
00:31:27,566 --> 00:31:31,127
Wally, I got to take out
the window from the dog.

695
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:33,137
- Walt?
- I can't shoot through...

696
00:31:33,171 --> 00:31:35,401
- What?
- Claire has a problem.

697
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,001
If I have a moment
of your time.

698
00:31:39,044 --> 00:31:41,103
- I cannot do the shot you want.
- Why not?

699
00:31:41,146 --> 00:31:43,614
Because it's got a window
with dogs in it.

700
00:31:43,648 --> 00:31:46,549
You want me to push in,
or lose the shot.

701
00:31:46,585 --> 00:31:48,450
No, you cannot
lose the shot.

702
00:31:48,486 --> 00:31:50,886
The meaning of the film
is in that shot.

703
00:31:50,922 --> 00:31:53,447
- But the window to the Fire--
- I don't care.

704
00:31:53,491 --> 00:31:56,517
Fix it.

705
00:31:56,561 --> 00:31:59,621
- Courtney...
- Hmm.

706
00:31:59,664 --> 00:32:01,222
Did you show Claire
these sketches?

707
00:32:01,266 --> 00:32:02,858
- Yes.
- Did she throw up?

708
00:32:02,901 --> 00:32:04,266
That's not very nice.

709
00:32:04,302 --> 00:32:05,792
Oh, really?

710
00:32:05,837 --> 00:32:07,828
Why don't you sue me
in the world court?

711
00:32:07,872 --> 00:32:09,271
Did she like
the costumes?

712
00:32:09,307 --> 00:32:10,706
- I can't tell.
- Why not?

713
00:32:10,742 --> 00:32:12,232
She won't stop crying.

714
00:32:12,277 --> 00:32:14,336
Oh, goody.

715
00:32:14,379 --> 00:32:16,108
Find out when
Marty Rossen's arriving.

716
00:32:16,147 --> 00:32:18,012
Get some lilacs
to send to the broad.

717
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:19,141
The town's out of lilacs.

718
00:32:20,952 --> 00:32:24,979
You go to her room, you take
the lilacs from the water,

719
00:32:25,023 --> 00:32:26,650
dry them,
get some cellophane,

720
00:32:26,691 --> 00:32:29,660
wrap them up,
get a card from Marty.

721
00:32:30,695 --> 00:32:31,787
Right.

722
00:32:33,565 --> 00:32:34,623
What's her problem?

723
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:36,634
She doesn't want
to bare her breasts.

724
00:32:36,668 --> 00:32:38,033
She doesn't want
to bare her breasts.

725
00:32:38,069 --> 00:32:39,331
In the nude scene?

726
00:32:39,371 --> 00:32:41,271
Why are we paying her
$3 million?

727
00:32:41,306 --> 00:32:42,705
She got religion.

728
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:46,268
Her religion bars her
from fulfilling her contract.

729
00:33:22,147 --> 00:33:23,637
Claire?

730
00:33:24,683 --> 00:33:26,241
Claire.

731
00:33:28,219 --> 00:33:29,481
Claire?

732
00:33:33,024 --> 00:33:34,685
What is it, pal?

733
00:33:36,494 --> 00:33:37,722
What?

734
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:41,360
I can't do it, Walt.

735
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:42,730
You can't do what?

736
00:33:42,767 --> 00:33:44,735
It isn't right.
I can't.

737
00:33:44,769 --> 00:33:47,101
I know I signed
the contract.

738
00:33:47,138 --> 00:33:50,938
I don't know if they told me
it was in the contract.

739
00:33:50,975 --> 00:33:53,273
Forget the contract.
What is it?

740
00:33:53,311 --> 00:33:56,212
I don't want to take
my shirt off.

741
00:33:56,247 --> 00:33:58,715
What are these things
they're asking of me?

742
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,116
What?
I try to be good.

743
00:34:01,152 --> 00:34:02,585
The only thing
I care about...

744
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:05,214
- I know that.
- ...is the movie.

745
00:34:05,256 --> 00:34:06,814
I know that.
We all know.

746
00:34:06,858 --> 00:34:10,350
- Everybody, they treat me--
- No, they don't.

747
00:34:10,395 --> 00:34:12,386
They treat me like a child.

748
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:14,159
Now, Claire...

749
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:16,224
To bare my body--

750
00:34:16,267 --> 00:34:18,735
What are they
asking of me?

751
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:21,170
Now look, Claire.

752
00:34:21,206 --> 00:34:22,833
I want to tell you
a story--

753
00:34:22,874 --> 00:34:24,842
What?

754
00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:31,709
Fuck flowers?
This isn't about flowers.

755
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,718
This is about a human being.

756
00:34:35,387 --> 00:34:37,378
Lilacs.

757
00:34:37,422 --> 00:34:38,480
Who are these from?

758
00:34:38,523 --> 00:34:39,319
Marty.

759
00:34:39,357 --> 00:34:41,917
That's very
thoughtful of him.

760
00:34:44,996 --> 00:34:46,520
- Eleanora Duse--
- I can't.

761
00:34:46,564 --> 00:34:47,462
Listen to me.

762
00:34:47,499 --> 00:34:49,865
Eleanora Duse
was playing Hamlet

763
00:34:49,901 --> 00:34:51,630
in London in 1 905

764
00:34:51,669 --> 00:34:54,137
and Royalty
could not get a ticket.

765
00:34:54,172 --> 00:34:58,836
She said, “I'm not doing the
seven shows a week I signed for.”

766
00:34:58,877 --> 00:35:02,108
She said, “I can't bare
my soul seven times a week.

767
00:35:02,147 --> 00:35:03,739
I am an artist.

768
00:35:03,782 --> 00:35:05,340
I'll do four shows a week.”

769
00:35:05,383 --> 00:35:07,317
The greatest actress
of her time.

770
00:35:07,352 --> 00:35:10,344
And do you know
what her producer said?

771
00:35:10,388 --> 00:35:11,514
What?

772
00:35:11,556 --> 00:35:15,117
Nothing.
He held her and he wept,

773
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:20,598
because he understood that
was her life's blood on the stage.

774
00:35:20,632 --> 00:35:23,157
I know. I know.

775
00:35:23,201 --> 00:35:25,692
And did she?

776
00:35:25,737 --> 00:35:27,568
She did the seven shows?

777
00:35:27,605 --> 00:35:29,436
No, she didn't.

778
00:35:29,474 --> 00:35:31,271
But I think
you should do this scene.

779
00:35:31,309 --> 00:35:32,207
Wally.

780
00:35:32,243 --> 00:35:35,076
I know. I know.

781
00:35:35,113 --> 00:35:37,138
It's the hardest thing
in the world.

782
00:35:37,182 --> 00:35:40,345
And sometimes it seems
everybody wants a--

783
00:35:40,385 --> 00:35:43,616
- Yes.
- wants a piece of us.

784
00:35:43,655 --> 00:35:44,952
And you know what?

785
00:35:47,392 --> 00:35:49,053
We have to give it.

786
00:35:49,093 --> 00:35:50,720
I don't know
what her problem is.

787
00:35:50,762 --> 00:35:53,856
She takes her shirt off
to do a voice over.

788
00:35:53,898 --> 00:35:55,263
What's her problem?

789
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,768
The country could draw
her tits from memory.

790
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:09,340
- I--
- Bill...

791
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,938
call her agent
in New York.

792
00:36:10,982 --> 00:36:12,745
Tell him she's breaking
her contract.

793
00:36:12,784 --> 00:36:15,218
We're very upset
with her.

794
00:36:15,253 --> 00:36:16,880
Get someone
to double for her.

795
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:18,684
Her tits.
The tit scene.

796
00:36:18,723 --> 00:36:19,781
Call L.A.

797
00:36:19,824 --> 00:36:22,258
I want to see pictures
of women's tits.

798
00:36:22,293 --> 00:36:23,351
I'm very sorry.

799
00:36:23,394 --> 00:36:26,454
You're very sorry, you passive
aggressive son of a bitch?

800
00:36:26,498 --> 00:36:27,465
Can we replace him?

801
00:36:27,499 --> 00:36:29,262
We start shooting
in three days.

802
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,927
You want to see
the fireman's costumes?

803
00:36:30,969 --> 00:36:32,493
Because I found this
moleskin for the color?

804
00:36:32,537 --> 00:36:34,437
Marty Rossen's
touched down.

805
00:36:34,472 --> 00:36:36,599
It's not black,
but it looks black.

806
00:36:36,641 --> 00:36:37,608
It's not brown--

807
00:36:37,642 --> 00:36:41,009
Yup, it's faggy without
being homosexual.

808
00:36:45,683 --> 00:36:47,913
Wait, wait, wait.
wait, wait.

809
00:36:47,952 --> 00:36:49,852
He gets a second chance,
do you see?

810
00:36:49,888 --> 00:36:51,253
And you get
a second chance.

811
00:36:51,289 --> 00:36:52,813
No, I don't.

812
00:36:52,857 --> 00:36:54,586
He doesn't go back
to the mill.

813
00:36:54,626 --> 00:36:58,084
He gets a second chance
to go back to the firehouse.

814
00:36:58,129 --> 00:37:00,825
You don't need
the old mill.

815
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,868
This is what--
you see?

816
00:37:03,902 --> 00:37:06,632
This is what your-- This
is what the script is saying?

817
00:37:06,671 --> 00:37:07,695
Hi, Annie.

818
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:09,070
Hi, Emma,
see you tonight.

819
00:37:09,107 --> 00:37:11,166
- Go, you Huskies.
- Go you, Huskies.

820
00:37:11,209 --> 00:37:14,804
What I see you saying is you have
the two elements, fire and water.

821
00:37:14,846 --> 00:37:16,711
The firehouse
and the old mill.

822
00:37:16,748 --> 00:37:18,215
You know, you could--

823
00:37:18,249 --> 00:37:19,511
What are you
doing tonight?

824
00:37:19,551 --> 00:37:21,143
- Me?
- Yeah.

825
00:37:21,185 --> 00:37:22,777
Tonight?

826
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,879
I have play practice.

827
00:37:24,923 --> 00:37:26,618
Oh.

828
00:37:28,259 --> 00:37:30,523
That's important.

829
00:37:34,265 --> 00:37:35,892
Come on, people.
Let's hump it. Let's go!

830
00:37:38,436 --> 00:37:40,301
Yeah.

831
00:37:40,338 --> 00:37:42,966
Let's go, let's go!
Come on, come on.

832
00:37:47,045 --> 00:37:48,137
You call
the broad out?

833
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:49,373
No, I left that
for you.

834
00:37:49,414 --> 00:37:51,245
That's thoughtful.

835
00:37:51,282 --> 00:37:52,408
Mmm, this is good.
Did you try this?

836
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:54,543
Oh, I'm really going
to eat carbohydrates.

837
00:37:54,586 --> 00:37:56,076
Dump this somewhere.

838
00:38:00,491 --> 00:38:02,118
What did you do,
build this?

839
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,287
- How was your flight?
- We're flying over pigs.

840
00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:07,059
- We're flying over sheep.
- Did you bring Bob's weights?

841
00:38:07,098 --> 00:38:08,690
They're coming FedEx.

842
00:38:08,733 --> 00:38:10,997
- What's in the bags?
- My undies.

843
00:38:11,035 --> 00:38:13,868
'Cause you can't get this picture
off, I'm going to wet myself.

844
00:38:13,905 --> 00:38:17,170
- I'm going to get it off.
- 55 days I take home the camera.

845
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:19,676
Oh, I got an idea
for a product placement--

846
00:38:19,711 --> 00:38:21,542
- Hi, Shelly.
- Hi, Doc.

847
00:38:21,579 --> 00:38:24,241
- How's the arm?
- Still itching.

848
00:38:24,282 --> 00:38:26,113
Good. A sign
it's getting well.

849
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:29,414
Good afternoon.

850
00:38:29,454 --> 00:38:31,945
- Stop.
- That's what I told you.

851
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:34,322
How are you getting on
with these fine people?

852
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:37,055
Like dykes and dogs.

853
00:38:37,095 --> 00:38:39,859
Did you see the grosses
for “Ghandi II”?

854
00:38:45,269 --> 00:38:46,429
Yeah? Come in?

855
00:38:49,007 --> 00:38:50,133
Ah, good.

856
00:38:51,776 --> 00:38:53,573
I just uh...

857
00:38:56,547 --> 00:38:58,344
Prices are going up.

858
00:39:00,118 --> 00:39:01,642
That's the way
of the world, isn't it?

859
00:39:01,686 --> 00:39:03,176
Everybody's got to eat.

860
00:39:04,222 --> 00:39:05,189
The way of the world.

861
00:39:07,525 --> 00:39:09,686
I'm being pretty impolite.

862
00:39:11,195 --> 00:39:12,457
Would you like some?

863
00:39:12,497 --> 00:39:14,931
I don't eat vegetables.

864
00:39:16,434 --> 00:39:18,629
Well, I could offer you
something to drink.

865
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,934
Sure, what have you got?

866
00:39:20,972 --> 00:39:22,530
What do you drink?

867
00:39:22,573 --> 00:39:24,871
Bourbon and milk.

868
00:39:27,445 --> 00:39:29,037
How old are you?

869
00:39:37,055 --> 00:39:38,682
Then I hope
you wouldn't tell anyone

870
00:39:38,723 --> 00:39:40,623
that I gave this to you.

871
00:39:40,658 --> 00:39:43,092
I would never tell anyone
anything that happened

872
00:39:43,127 --> 00:39:45,527
between me and somebody
who was my friend.

873
00:39:50,468 --> 00:39:52,333
Yeah.

874
00:39:55,373 --> 00:39:56,670
Nice town you got here.

875
00:39:56,708 --> 00:40:00,474
We could see it a lot better
if we were on the roof.

876
00:40:00,511 --> 00:40:03,207
Wouldn't that
be dangerous?

877
00:40:03,247 --> 00:40:05,340
Not if you have
something to hold onto.

878
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:17,318
The requirement is you
tell me what the shot is.

879
00:40:17,361 --> 00:40:20,762
Because if you cannot
tell me what is it

880
00:40:20,798 --> 00:40:22,789
how can I take
pictures of it?

881
00:40:22,834 --> 00:40:28,704
Wally wants me to push in
through the window.

882
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,332
How can I push in
through the window?

883
00:40:30,374 --> 00:40:32,274
- Yeah. No. Um...
- Telephone.

884
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:34,301
Scusa.

885
00:40:34,345 --> 00:40:35,972
Pronto?

886
00:40:51,062 --> 00:40:53,394
Hello.
How are you?

887
00:40:53,431 --> 00:40:55,194
I thought you had
play practice.

888
00:40:55,233 --> 00:40:57,497
- What happened?
- The cast stood me up.

889
00:40:57,535 --> 00:41:00,402
They're all preparing
for the auditions for your movie.

890
00:41:03,407 --> 00:41:05,466
My glasses fell apart.
I lost the--

891
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:07,535
Lost the screw?

892
00:41:07,578 --> 00:41:09,136
- Good evening, Annie.
- Evening, sweetheart.

893
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,408
Go, you Huskies.

894
00:41:10,448 --> 00:41:11,881
You said it.

895
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:15,745
Do you like kids?

896
00:41:17,054 --> 00:41:19,284
I never saw
the point of them.

897
00:41:19,323 --> 00:41:21,985
Me, too.

898
00:41:22,026 --> 00:41:24,586
Do you have a paper clip
to fix my glasses?

899
00:41:24,629 --> 00:41:26,187
Better idea.

900
00:41:28,132 --> 00:41:30,464
Hold up, Cathy,
I need you.

901
00:41:30,501 --> 00:41:32,059
Oh, watch out
for that lure.

902
00:41:34,505 --> 00:41:36,473
Can I get some
fishing line?

903
00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:40,134
Okay, let's see
what we've got.

904
00:41:45,383 --> 00:41:48,181
A little fishing line,
a little country wisdom

905
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:49,948
and the world's our oyster.

906
00:41:49,987 --> 00:41:52,547
I'm going to fix you up
a brand new hinge.

907
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:54,023
It'll be as good as new.

908
00:41:54,058 --> 00:41:55,958
Better than new
because it has a story.

909
00:41:55,993 --> 00:41:57,392
Uh huh.

910
00:41:57,428 --> 00:41:59,828
Presto chango.

911
00:41:59,864 --> 00:42:02,389
The inherently
helpful qualities

912
00:42:02,433 --> 00:42:04,799
of every day
household things.

913
00:42:04,836 --> 00:42:06,804
Uh huh.

914
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:07,668
There you go.

915
00:42:07,705 --> 00:42:10,071
Let me try it.

916
00:42:11,509 --> 00:42:14,137
Careful you don't
burn yourself.

917
00:42:14,178 --> 00:42:15,167
Ow!

918
00:42:15,213 --> 00:42:16,612
God.

919
00:42:20,952 --> 00:42:22,385
You know what
you got there?

920
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,615
You got a fish hook
in your finger.

921
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:27,248
I'm right proud of you.

922
00:42:29,961 --> 00:42:32,555
Let me tell you something,
Wally he's a pussycat.

923
00:42:32,597 --> 00:42:35,896
My thing is to see everybody
does what they said they would.

924
00:42:35,933 --> 00:42:37,230
Now what is this?

925
00:42:37,268 --> 00:42:40,362
You want $800,000 to do
what you're being paid to?

926
00:42:40,404 --> 00:42:41,962
You already signed
you'd do?

927
00:42:42,006 --> 00:42:42,973
What is that?

928
00:42:43,007 --> 00:42:45,100
I think I should
talk to my agent.

929
00:42:45,142 --> 00:42:46,803
You and I should...
we should really--

930
00:42:46,844 --> 00:42:48,471
- Who is her agent?
- Mitch Cohen.

931
00:42:48,512 --> 00:42:49,479
Get him on the phone.

932
00:42:49,513 --> 00:42:50,741
He's on the island.

933
00:42:50,781 --> 00:42:53,716
Get him on the phone?
I want you to hear this.

934
00:42:53,751 --> 00:42:54,775
It's ringing.

935
00:42:54,819 --> 00:42:57,151
I really think
that business matters

936
00:42:57,188 --> 00:42:58,416
should be discussed
between you two.

937
00:42:58,456 --> 00:43:01,152
I'm gonna discuss them between
you because it's your idea.

938
00:43:01,192 --> 00:43:05,356
If you're going to sign to do a job
and then hold us up, you are in error.

939
00:43:05,396 --> 00:43:07,387
- He's on the phone.
- Thank you.

940
00:43:07,431 --> 00:43:09,422
Mitch, this is Marty Rossen,
I'm here in...

941
00:43:09,467 --> 00:43:12,368
- Waterford, Vermont.
- I'm somewhere on location.

942
00:43:12,403 --> 00:43:15,566
I'm going to solve it here
or this bimbo you sent me

943
00:43:15,606 --> 00:43:18,507
is going to be doing a donkey
act on public access television.

944
00:43:19,477 --> 00:43:23,436
- Hi.
- Her tits. Her tits?

945
00:43:23,481 --> 00:43:26,279
That she signed
in her contract.

946
00:43:26,317 --> 00:43:28,512
We hired her because of 1 0 years
at the actor's studio?

947
00:43:28,552 --> 00:43:29,951
The way she played Medea?

948
00:43:29,987 --> 00:43:32,888
Her last two pictures laid
on the screen like my first wife.

949
00:43:32,924 --> 00:43:35,017
- You have no right--
- Cool it, you started this.

950
00:43:35,059 --> 00:43:36,924
- What's the--?
- Where have you been?

951
00:43:36,961 --> 00:43:40,988
You tell me, you tell me now.
I got to shoot on Wednesday!

952
00:43:41,032 --> 00:43:42,795
I will not pay
your blood money.

953
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:44,801
P.S. I put the word
out on the street

954
00:43:44,835 --> 00:43:47,201
and Betty Boop can look
for work in squiggle-vision?

955
00:43:47,238 --> 00:43:48,205
Sit down.

956
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:51,231
I don't think you should
talk to a lady like that.

957
00:43:51,275 --> 00:43:53,470
- Would you excuse me, please?
- You can't treat me like this.

958
00:43:53,511 --> 00:43:55,138
I'm not a child.

959
00:43:55,179 --> 00:43:57,511
- She's absolutely right.
- I'm not a child?

960
00:43:57,548 --> 00:44:00,381
I have feelings.
I mean, don't you--

961
00:44:00,418 --> 00:44:02,648
Don't--
Don't--

962
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,655
Because I want to
tell you something

963
00:44:04,689 --> 00:44:07,624
and I think you know
what I mean.

964
00:44:11,128 --> 00:44:13,596
Well, you call him
and you call me back,

965
00:44:13,631 --> 00:44:16,031
but this is it, pal.
You fuck with me

966
00:44:16,067 --> 00:44:17,398
and I'm going
to tear out your heart

967
00:44:17,435 --> 00:44:19,767
and piss on your lungs
through the hole in your chest.

968
00:44:19,804 --> 00:44:22,898
And the best to Marion.
Where have you been?

969
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,204
He says they're looking
for you all day.

970
00:44:25,242 --> 00:44:27,005
You're on salary,
he needs pages.

971
00:44:27,044 --> 00:44:28,671
What are you--?
You been haguing?

972
00:44:28,713 --> 00:44:29,907
- Now--
- Marty?

973
00:44:29,947 --> 00:44:31,073
Later for that,
let's get this.

974
00:44:31,115 --> 00:44:33,242
We need the pages
for “The Old Mill”.

975
00:44:33,284 --> 00:44:35,252
We need a new title.
We need--

976
00:44:35,286 --> 00:44:37,277
Rewrite for Bob,
the dead horse scene.

977
00:44:37,321 --> 00:44:38,686
Whatever it is,
go do it.

978
00:44:38,723 --> 00:44:40,054
How are you doing
on the permit?

979
00:44:40,091 --> 00:44:42,252
- It's just a formality.
- That's why I want it.

980
00:44:42,293 --> 00:44:44,420
Go on, type it up
and get it back to me.

981
00:44:44,462 --> 00:44:45,724
I can't.

982
00:44:45,763 --> 00:44:47,025
Don't tell me
you can't write it.

983
00:44:47,064 --> 00:44:48,691
No, I can write it.
I can't type it.

984
00:44:48,733 --> 00:44:50,132
Why?

985
00:44:50,167 --> 00:44:51,600
Hurt my finger.

986
00:44:51,635 --> 00:44:53,762
Get a typist.
Get him a typist!

987
00:44:53,804 --> 00:44:56,034
Get out of here.

988
00:44:56,073 --> 00:44:58,803
Get out of here or we're
going to have you killed.

989
00:45:02,747 --> 00:45:04,977
800 grand
to show her tits.

990
00:45:05,016 --> 00:45:06,005
Pay her.

991
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:06,880
I don't got the money.

992
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:08,009
Find the money.

993
00:45:08,052 --> 00:45:09,314
I got a company
that will give us

994
00:45:09,353 --> 00:45:11,878
a million dollars to put
their product in the film.

995
00:45:11,922 --> 00:45:13,116
A product placement.

996
00:45:13,157 --> 00:45:15,557
- Yeah, take a look.
- What is it?

997
00:45:16,227 --> 00:45:18,752
No no no no!

998
00:45:18,796 --> 00:45:20,263
Just find me the money!

999
00:45:23,734 --> 00:45:26,498
This is Joe White in 201.

1000
00:45:26,537 --> 00:45:28,266
They're sending up
a typist.

1001
00:45:29,807 --> 00:45:32,071
Okay. No, I thank you.
It's here.

1002
00:45:32,109 --> 00:45:33,974
Come in.

1003
00:45:34,011 --> 00:45:35,444
Hi.

1004
00:45:36,981 --> 00:45:38,471
Hi.

1005
00:45:38,516 --> 00:45:39,642
May I come in?

1006
00:45:40,684 --> 00:45:41,651
Please.

1007
00:45:49,527 --> 00:45:53,361
You said, “You can't talk
that way to a lady.”

1008
00:45:53,397 --> 00:45:55,365
You stood up for me.

1009
00:45:57,668 --> 00:45:58,862
What do you have
to drink?

1010
00:45:58,903 --> 00:46:00,598
I don't drink.

1011
00:46:00,638 --> 00:46:02,697
Matzoh.

1012
00:46:05,976 --> 00:46:07,967
Are you Jewish?

1013
00:46:08,012 --> 00:46:09,411
Well, actually--

1014
00:46:09,447 --> 00:46:10,641
I love Jewish men.

1015
00:46:12,216 --> 00:46:13,547
Why?

1016
00:46:13,584 --> 00:46:15,313
You know.

1017
00:46:16,487 --> 00:46:18,318
Where's your bathroom?

1018
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,557
You liked
the script, huh?

1019
00:46:32,036 --> 00:46:34,402
- Where have you been.
- Hi.

1020
00:46:37,842 --> 00:46:40,333
- We had a date.
- We did?

1021
00:46:40,377 --> 00:46:43,312
- Where have you been?
- I've been thinking.

1022
00:46:43,347 --> 00:46:44,746
Well, I know,
because they told me

1023
00:46:44,782 --> 00:46:46,443
you were with that writer
from the--

1024
00:46:46,484 --> 00:46:49,112
You see,
this is what I mean.

1025
00:46:49,153 --> 00:46:51,587
The whole town's
been warped

1026
00:46:51,622 --> 00:46:53,522
by the presence
of the movie company.

1027
00:46:53,557 --> 00:46:55,548
They holler
and we jump.

1028
00:46:55,593 --> 00:46:56,685
You have a date,
they call,

1029
00:46:56,727 --> 00:46:58,251
you're doing business
9:00 at night.

1030
00:46:58,295 --> 00:46:59,956
I wasn't doing business.

1031
00:46:59,997 --> 00:47:02,261
Oh, well, what
were you doing, then

1032
00:47:02,299 --> 00:47:04,767
that's so important you
shouldn't call your fiancé?

1033
00:47:04,802 --> 00:47:06,770
I...
have to tell you

1034
00:47:06,804 --> 00:47:09,364
that's it's all over
between us, Doug.

1035
00:47:10,741 --> 00:47:13,642
I...

1036
00:47:13,677 --> 00:47:16,578
met somebody else
and it's very serious

1037
00:47:16,614 --> 00:47:18,172
and it's over.

1038
00:47:18,215 --> 00:47:21,446
Wait. So serious you couldn't
call to tell me you'd be--

1039
00:47:21,485 --> 00:47:22,952
What did you say?

1040
00:47:22,987 --> 00:47:25,046
It's all over between us.

1041
00:47:25,089 --> 00:47:27,057
I've met someone else.

1042
00:47:28,392 --> 00:47:30,724
Who is this person
that you've found?

1043
00:47:30,761 --> 00:47:33,059
He works on the movie.

1044
00:47:33,097 --> 00:47:35,565
No, don't tell me that.

1045
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,430
I'm sorry.

1046
00:47:47,411 --> 00:47:48,776
Can you type?

1047
00:47:48,812 --> 00:47:51,144
If you can,
they need you at the hotel.

1048
00:47:51,182 --> 00:47:52,774
Can you type?

1049
00:47:52,816 --> 00:47:55,216
Never admit you can type.

1050
00:47:55,252 --> 00:47:56,742
Okay.

1051
00:48:08,098 --> 00:48:09,827
All right, look--

1052
00:48:09,867 --> 00:48:11,835
I feel so close to you.

1053
00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:13,632
I like you very much.

1054
00:48:13,671 --> 00:48:15,138
I like you, too.

1055
00:48:15,172 --> 00:48:16,764
Look, I met someone.

1056
00:48:18,976 --> 00:48:20,841
- Who is it?
- Room service.

1057
00:48:20,878 --> 00:48:22,573
Could you leave it
just outside the door?

1058
00:48:22,613 --> 00:48:24,444
You have to sign for it.

1059
00:48:26,984 --> 00:48:27,814
Would you excuse me?

1060
00:48:27,851 --> 00:48:29,216
Of course.

1061
00:48:31,455 --> 00:48:33,480
- Hi?
- Oh, God.

1062
00:48:33,524 --> 00:48:36,152
I'm going to be your typist
for this evening.

1063
00:48:36,193 --> 00:48:38,525
And here's some
hydrogen-peroxide.

1064
00:48:38,562 --> 00:48:39,654
I don't drink.

1065
00:48:39,697 --> 00:48:41,130
It's for your finger.

1066
00:48:41,165 --> 00:48:43,497
That's very thoughtful.

1067
00:48:43,534 --> 00:48:45,900
Here I am.
Shall we get down to it?

1068
00:48:51,709 --> 00:48:52,698
Thought you might
like these.

1069
00:48:52,743 --> 00:48:54,438
Well, thank you
very much.

1070
00:48:55,679 --> 00:48:57,613
Read the card.

1071
00:48:57,648 --> 00:49:00,674
“To the love of my life.
Love, Doug.”

1072
00:49:00,718 --> 00:49:02,481
The other side.

1073
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:04,384
Oh.
Wait! Wait.

1074
00:49:04,421 --> 00:49:05,615
Where are you going?

1075
00:49:05,656 --> 00:49:07,817
Don't you think we should
put these in water?

1076
00:49:07,858 --> 00:49:09,655
For God's sake, why?

1077
00:49:09,693 --> 00:49:12,491
Because if you don't,
they die?

1078
00:49:12,529 --> 00:49:13,860
Hmm.

1079
00:49:15,232 --> 00:49:16,756
And in my opinion
that makes them

1080
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,291
so much
less attractive.

1081
00:49:19,336 --> 00:49:20,963
Wait wait wait!
Don't do that.

1082
00:49:21,005 --> 00:49:22,973
You shouldn't do that.
Wait.

1083
00:49:24,241 --> 00:49:26,505
Yup, the little things
mean a lot.

1084
00:49:26,543 --> 00:49:28,875
Yes, the little things
mean a lot.

1085
00:49:28,912 --> 00:49:30,903
It's so true.

1086
00:49:30,948 --> 00:49:34,816
For example, I once had
an uncle who was bit by a spider

1087
00:49:34,852 --> 00:49:36,410
and he lost
his sense of smell.

1088
00:49:38,389 --> 00:49:40,084
Can I have a cracker?

1089
00:49:47,765 --> 00:49:49,255
Shouldn't we start?

1090
00:49:51,001 --> 00:49:52,332
Let's start--

1091
00:49:53,537 --> 00:49:55,334
Start typing.

1092
00:49:55,372 --> 00:49:57,033
This isn't a good time.

1093
00:49:57,074 --> 00:49:59,770
Oh, all right.

1094
00:50:00,811 --> 00:50:05,271
Then I'll come back
at a better time.

1095
00:50:05,316 --> 00:50:06,510
What would be
a better time?

1096
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:07,983
Later on.

1097
00:50:08,018 --> 00:50:09,508
Then I'll come back then.

1098
00:50:15,793 --> 00:50:17,761
You going out with
your fiancé tonight?

1099
00:50:17,795 --> 00:50:19,319
No, no,
that's not happening.

1100
00:50:21,398 --> 00:50:22,956
I'll see you tomorrow.

1101
00:50:35,779 --> 00:50:36,973
Hi.

1102
00:50:38,182 --> 00:50:39,672
Hi.

1103
00:50:39,717 --> 00:50:41,708
It occurred to me
you'd want to have this,

1104
00:50:41,752 --> 00:50:43,982
sort of as a memento
of our--

1105
00:50:44,021 --> 00:50:46,581
Oh, I hope I'm not
disturbing you.

1106
00:50:48,425 --> 00:50:50,450
She came in here--

1107
00:50:50,494 --> 00:50:52,553
Wait, she--

1108
00:50:52,596 --> 00:50:54,086
I was giving her
a massage.

1109
00:50:55,132 --> 00:50:56,793
Wait.

1110
00:50:56,834 --> 00:50:58,859
Wait,
she came in here--

1111
00:50:58,902 --> 00:51:00,164
She--

1112
00:51:00,204 --> 00:51:01,501
With all due respect,

1113
00:51:01,538 --> 00:51:03,130
she took off her clothes

1114
00:51:03,173 --> 00:51:04,265
and she got into bed

1115
00:51:04,308 --> 00:51:06,299
and I told her
we could not

1116
00:51:06,343 --> 00:51:07,833
because we don't
know each other--

1117
00:51:07,878 --> 00:51:10,244
We had a script
conference.

1118
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,043
And I said,
“Thank you very much.”

1119
00:51:12,082 --> 00:51:15,279
I had a couple
questions about a line.

1120
00:51:15,319 --> 00:51:16,513
But, uh--

1121
00:51:16,787 --> 00:51:21,053
It was inconvenient
because...

1122
00:51:21,091 --> 00:51:22,786
because--

1123
00:51:22,826 --> 00:51:24,453
You can do it.

1124
00:51:24,495 --> 00:51:26,759
Because I met
someone else.

1125
00:51:26,797 --> 00:51:28,697
Oh, okay.

1126
00:51:28,732 --> 00:51:29,721
You believe that?

1127
00:51:29,767 --> 00:51:31,735
I do if you do.

1128
00:51:31,769 --> 00:51:33,498
But it's absurd.

1129
00:51:33,537 --> 00:51:36,938
So is our electoral process
but we still vote.

1130
00:51:39,676 --> 00:51:41,075
Wait.

1131
00:51:41,111 --> 00:51:44,308
Do you truly think the
electoral process is absurd?

1132
00:51:44,348 --> 00:51:46,316
I used to go out
with a politician.

1133
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:48,215
You used to go out with him?
You broke up with him?

1134
00:51:48,252 --> 00:51:49,913
Time for a change.

1135
00:51:51,955 --> 00:51:53,115
Keep your margins straight.

1136
00:51:53,157 --> 00:51:54,624
Yes.

1137
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:28,383
Don't worry
about that permit.

1138
00:52:28,425 --> 00:52:31,656
That is right fine
of you, Mr. Mayor.

1139
00:52:31,695 --> 00:52:32,957
George.

1140
00:52:32,996 --> 00:52:34,861
- Morning, George.
- Chuckie.

1141
00:52:34,898 --> 00:52:36,126
Sherry,
your brother's here.

1142
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:38,600
We're glad
to have you here.

1143
00:52:38,635 --> 00:52:39,932
My wife, Sherry,

1144
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:42,803
we're having a party
Tuesday night--

1145
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,398
Walt and Bob Barrenger--

1146
00:52:44,441 --> 00:52:46,909
invite them over--
home cooked meal.

1147
00:52:46,944 --> 00:52:50,880
- If you'd like to join us.
- I'd be honored.

1148
00:52:50,914 --> 00:52:54,008
- Sherry, this is Mr., uh...
- Where the hell have you been?

1149
00:52:55,052 --> 00:52:56,576
It's a quarter after 9:00.

1150
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:58,850
- I've been on the phone--
- Morning, Mrs. Bailey.

1151
00:52:58,889 --> 00:53:01,323
I have two days--

1152
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:03,417
This is Mr. Rossen.
He is the producer--

1153
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,758
- Hello.
- I am so glad to meet you?

1154
00:53:05,796 --> 00:53:08,594
We're glad to have you here
and welcome to our--

1155
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:12,727
Yearly, we redecorate
to restore it

1156
00:53:12,769 --> 00:53:14,964
to the original
1 835 condition.

1157
00:53:15,005 --> 00:53:18,236
- What is that?
- The house.

1158
00:53:18,275 --> 00:53:21,608
The original kitchen,
of course, burned in 1 960,

1159
00:53:21,645 --> 00:53:23,840
as part of a spate
of suspicious fires,

1160
00:53:23,881 --> 00:53:26,611
which in fact,
lead to the inspiration

1161
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:28,675
of the formation
of the Waterford Huskies?

1162
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:29,777
My, oh, my!

1163
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,879
Would you like
a cup of tea?

1164
00:53:31,922 --> 00:53:34,755
George, I have
to talk to you.

1165
00:53:34,791 --> 00:53:37,055
This is Mr. Rossen.
He's the producer.

1166
00:53:37,094 --> 00:53:38,322
I want you
to hear this, pal.

1167
00:53:38,362 --> 00:53:41,854
Forget the overages, forget
$1 0,000 for three days to two weeks.

1168
00:53:41,899 --> 00:53:44,459
Do you know what it would cost
to build this town as a set?

1169
00:53:44,501 --> 00:53:46,401
$6 million.

1170
00:53:46,436 --> 00:53:48,768
Now the Waterford
Merchant's Association

1171
00:53:48,805 --> 00:53:51,638
demands through me
as their council

1172
00:53:51,675 --> 00:53:54,109
5% of the profits
of the movie,

1173
00:53:54,144 --> 00:53:57,602
as geared to the most
favorable definition of profits

1174
00:53:57,648 --> 00:53:59,138
of either “A,”
the producer--

1175
00:53:59,182 --> 00:54:01,207
Counselor,
I am sure--

1176
00:54:01,251 --> 00:54:02,775
No, I am positive,

1177
00:54:02,819 --> 00:54:04,309
we can reach some
accommodation.

1178
00:54:04,354 --> 00:54:06,720
I am thrilled and relieved
to hear you say that,

1179
00:54:06,757 --> 00:54:09,123
and thank you, sir.
What did you have in mind?

1180
00:54:09,159 --> 00:54:12,287
Don't tell me you
don't have any wallpaper.

1181
00:54:12,329 --> 00:54:13,557
I told you we could
have it by Wednesday.

1182
00:54:13,597 --> 00:54:15,963
Don't tell me you don't
have any wallpaper.

1183
00:54:15,999 --> 00:54:18,729
The biggest grossing
box office star in the world

1184
00:54:18,769 --> 00:54:20,600
is coming to dinner
on Tuesday.

1185
00:54:20,637 --> 00:54:21,968
Well, if you'd ordered
something common...

1186
00:54:22,005 --> 00:54:24,473
I'm going to give you
something common.

1187
00:54:24,508 --> 00:54:26,533
I'm going to give you
an injunction as well.

1188
00:54:26,577 --> 00:54:27,703
Mr. Mayor.

1189
00:54:27,744 --> 00:54:29,109
Mr. Mayor--

1190
00:54:29,146 --> 00:54:31,205
Why you cheap,
little heb.

1191
00:54:31,248 --> 00:54:36,015
“Assembly of Death” did
$95 million the first weekend.

1192
00:54:36,053 --> 00:54:37,884
Yeah, but those grosses
are inflated.

1193
00:54:37,921 --> 00:54:39,047
You think so?

1194
00:54:39,089 --> 00:54:41,887
Well, you got to look
at the per screen averages.

1195
00:54:44,061 --> 00:54:45,892
Hi, Annie.

1196
00:54:45,929 --> 00:54:49,797
I'm sorry I haven't been
to a meeting of the drama club.

1197
00:54:52,603 --> 00:54:54,264
Oh, that's too bad.

1198
00:54:57,007 --> 00:54:58,167
Hello.

1199
00:55:02,446 --> 00:55:03,413
What's the matter?

1200
00:55:03,447 --> 00:55:06,382
I can't seem to get it
to come out right.

1201
00:55:08,185 --> 00:55:09,152
What's the scene?

1202
00:55:09,186 --> 00:55:11,245
It used to be
the old mill.

1203
00:55:11,288 --> 00:55:12,755
What do you got?

1204
00:55:12,789 --> 00:55:15,121
They meet on Main Street,

1205
00:55:15,158 --> 00:55:17,251
her horse has just died.

1206
00:55:17,294 --> 00:55:19,387
He's coming from the fire.

1207
00:55:19,429 --> 00:55:21,420
Annie, do you want
something to eat?

1208
00:55:21,465 --> 00:55:23,797
What's the scene about?

1209
00:55:23,834 --> 00:55:26,826
I don't know anymore.

1210
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:28,303
Have you seen Carla?

1211
00:55:28,338 --> 00:55:29,305
No.

1212
00:55:32,175 --> 00:55:33,733
He sees her
on the street.

1213
00:55:33,777 --> 00:55:35,802
He wipes the soot
from his eyes.

1214
00:55:35,846 --> 00:55:38,508
He goes up to her--

1215
00:55:38,548 --> 00:55:40,573
“What happened
to the horse?”

1216
00:55:40,617 --> 00:55:43,848
He-- She...

1217
00:55:43,887 --> 00:55:45,514
looks at him.

1218
00:55:45,555 --> 00:55:46,886
She takes his hand--

1219
00:55:46,923 --> 00:55:48,049
- Ow.
- I hurt you.

1220
00:55:48,091 --> 00:55:49,854
I hurt your finger.

1221
00:55:49,893 --> 00:55:50,917
What happened
to his finger?

1222
00:55:50,961 --> 00:55:52,929
It was burnt.

1223
00:55:52,963 --> 00:55:54,294
Then it was really hurt.

1224
00:55:54,331 --> 00:55:57,357
Ah ah ah?

1225
00:55:57,401 --> 00:55:59,631
That's what she says.

1226
00:56:00,671 --> 00:56:02,730
That's what she says.

1227
00:56:02,773 --> 00:56:04,297
He says,

1228
00:56:04,341 --> 00:56:08,038
“Sister, I've come
from a fire.”

1229
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:13,641
But she realizes

1230
00:56:13,684 --> 00:56:15,675
it was not the fire
that hurt him,

1231
00:56:15,719 --> 00:56:18,051
that the true hurt
was her.

1232
00:56:18,088 --> 00:56:23,321
- Was her unbridled sexuality...
- Yes. Yes.

1233
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:27,763
because, because
it's about purity.

1234
00:56:27,798 --> 00:56:29,993
It's... it's...

1235
00:56:30,033 --> 00:56:32,001
it's...

1236
00:56:32,035 --> 00:56:36,096
And then you don't need
the nude scene.

1237
00:56:36,139 --> 00:56:38,107
Because it's about purity!

1238
00:56:38,141 --> 00:56:41,907
Take any two people--
Take you and me--

1239
00:56:51,955 --> 00:56:54,924
I've always thought so.

1240
00:56:55,959 --> 00:56:58,951
The finest people you could
ever hope to work with.

1241
00:56:58,995 --> 00:57:00,326
Do you have the new
old mill pages?

1242
00:57:00,363 --> 00:57:01,728
I can't find the writer.

1243
00:57:01,765 --> 00:57:03,096
Totally false.

1244
00:57:04,201 --> 00:57:05,463
Totally false.

1245
00:57:05,502 --> 00:57:09,996
He is the most responsible
human being I have ever--

1246
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,201
- I have to talk to you.
- Not now.

1247
00:57:12,242 --> 00:57:13,675
My wife is going
to have a baby.

1248
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:15,405
That's great.
Let's bring more people

1249
00:57:15,445 --> 00:57:17,208
into this
over crowded world.

1250
00:57:17,247 --> 00:57:18,509
Yes?

1251
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:22,084
Yes, I know
what you mean.

1252
00:57:23,553 --> 00:57:25,578
Yes, that's very,
very true.

1253
00:57:25,622 --> 00:57:26,748
Take it off.

1254
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:28,985
Take off that stupid,
fucking shirt right now.

1255
00:57:29,025 --> 00:57:30,856
Take it off.

1256
00:57:30,894 --> 00:57:34,261
Well, if I had to say
one thing,

1257
00:57:34,297 --> 00:57:37,698
it's about purity.

1258
00:57:37,734 --> 00:57:39,429
Miss Wellesley's
bags, please.

1259
00:57:39,469 --> 00:57:40,868
Claire?

1260
00:57:40,904 --> 00:57:42,166
The plane is waiting.

1261
00:57:42,205 --> 00:57:43,866
I've written a letter
to the studio

1262
00:57:43,907 --> 00:57:46,307
and to SAG protesting--
Get a copy of that letter.

1263
00:57:46,343 --> 00:57:49,073
I just want to say
I am past chagrin.

1264
00:57:49,112 --> 00:57:51,546
I am mortified at the way
you were spoken to.

1265
00:57:51,581 --> 00:57:53,412
An artist of your caliber.

1266
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:55,850
When I read this script
I said there is only

1267
00:57:55,886 --> 00:57:57,581
one person to play
that part.

1268
00:57:57,621 --> 00:57:59,111
The minute I read
the script I said--

1269
00:57:59,156 --> 00:58:00,487
I know.

1270
00:58:00,524 --> 00:58:02,924
I said she works
with animals,

1271
00:58:02,959 --> 00:58:04,256
she has a home.

1272
00:58:04,294 --> 00:58:05,818
A woman who--

1273
00:58:05,862 --> 00:58:08,729
The community respects her.
Please don't go.

1274
00:58:08,765 --> 00:58:12,166
Please don't go.
What can I do but beseech you?

1275
00:58:12,202 --> 00:58:13,533
Trauma? Toil?

1276
00:58:15,105 --> 00:58:17,198
All things must end.

1277
00:58:18,175 --> 00:58:20,700
You just get an idea
and try to find

1278
00:58:20,744 --> 00:58:23,042
the best way
to express it pictorially.

1279
00:58:23,079 --> 00:58:24,046
Claire?

1280
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,069
Claire.

1281
00:58:26,483 --> 00:58:28,951
As an interpretive artist
to a creative artist,

1282
00:58:28,985 --> 00:58:31,476
stay with me,
I need you.

1283
00:58:31,521 --> 00:58:33,011
We start to shoot
in two days.

1284
00:58:33,056 --> 00:58:34,614
Then it belongs to us.

1285
00:58:34,658 --> 00:58:36,216
Stay.

1286
00:58:36,259 --> 00:58:39,160
Tonight when they've
all gone, let's talk.

1287
00:58:39,196 --> 00:58:41,323
Let's really talk.
We'll have dinner.

1288
00:58:41,364 --> 00:58:43,855
A bottle of bad red wine.
We'll eat spaghetti--

1289
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:45,527
I'm sorry,
it's gone beyond that.

1290
00:58:47,103 --> 00:58:49,503
I've enjoyed it, too.

1291
00:58:49,539 --> 00:58:52,099
I've always enjoyed
your publication.

1292
00:58:52,142 --> 00:58:54,474
Any time.

1293
00:58:54,511 --> 00:58:56,741
What does that woman
want from life?

1294
00:58:57,781 --> 00:59:00,477
She wants $800,000
to show her tits.

1295
00:59:00,517 --> 00:59:01,848
Pay her off.

1296
00:59:01,885 --> 00:59:03,716
- We don't have the money.
- Find the money.

1297
00:59:03,753 --> 00:59:05,516
If you do
the product placement--

1298
00:59:05,555 --> 00:59:09,150
It's a computer company.

1299
00:59:09,192 --> 00:59:12,025
- Bazoomer Com?!
- Bazoomer dot com.

1300
00:59:12,062 --> 00:59:16,294
I can't put a computer
in a film shot in 1 895!

1301
00:59:16,333 --> 00:59:18,233
You want to tell me
how to do that?

1302
00:59:18,268 --> 00:59:20,031
The art department
had some ideas.

1303
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:22,265
No no no no!
Just pay her off!

1304
00:59:22,305 --> 00:59:23,670
Call Howie.

1305
00:59:26,576 --> 00:59:28,703
Give me Howie Gold.

1306
00:59:28,745 --> 00:59:29,905
Howie, this is--

1307
00:59:29,946 --> 00:59:32,779
I need 800 grand.

1308
00:59:33,984 --> 00:59:36,782
I don't care where
it comes from.

1309
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:38,617
It comes out of our end.

1310
00:59:38,655 --> 00:59:40,418
Well, that's a shock.

1311
00:59:40,457 --> 00:59:43,017
- I need--
- She doesn't show her tits?

1312
00:59:43,059 --> 00:59:44,651
Just get me the money.

1313
00:59:44,694 --> 00:59:47,185
Hey, she doesn't
show her tits?

1314
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:49,357
She doesn't show
her tits.

1315
00:59:49,399 --> 00:59:51,492
Her breasts
symbolize motherhood.

1316
00:59:51,534 --> 00:59:53,866
The breasts
symbolize motherhood?

1317
00:59:53,904 --> 00:59:56,168
The movie's about purity.

1318
00:59:56,206 --> 00:59:57,969
So we don't show
her breasts.

1319
00:59:58,008 --> 00:59:59,600
We show them to him.

1320
00:59:59,643 --> 01:00:01,201
She keeps her back
to the camera.

1321
01:00:01,244 --> 01:00:02,438
It'll hurt
the box office.

1322
01:00:02,479 --> 01:00:04,140
They know what
her tits look like.

1323
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:06,774
Know? They could
draw them from memory.

1324
01:00:09,619 --> 01:00:11,814
You are fantastic.

1325
01:00:11,855 --> 01:00:13,880
What a find you are?
Get out of here.

1326
01:00:13,924 --> 01:00:15,516
I still need
the dead horse scene.

1327
01:00:15,558 --> 01:00:16,957
- I'm going to nail it.
- I know you are.

1328
01:00:16,993 --> 01:00:19,621
- Go, you Huskies.
- Go, you Huskies?

1329
01:00:19,663 --> 01:00:21,995
- Mr. Rossen?
- Yeah?

1330
01:00:22,032 --> 01:00:23,431
Thank you.

1331
01:00:24,501 --> 01:00:25,866
We just got the permit.

1332
01:00:25,902 --> 01:00:28,029
Stop her
at the airport!

1333
01:00:28,071 --> 01:00:29,095
Catch the broad
at the airport.

1334
01:00:29,139 --> 01:00:30,106
Send her back here.

1335
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:32,574
Catch the broad
at the airport.

1336
01:00:32,609 --> 01:00:34,907
That Joe, he is
one hell of a kid.

1337
01:00:34,945 --> 01:00:37,379
He just saved us
800,000 bucks?

1338
01:00:37,414 --> 01:00:38,938
He's got a gift
for fiction.

1339
01:00:38,982 --> 01:00:41,348
We got to do
something nice for him.

1340
01:00:41,384 --> 01:00:43,079
Hey, come here.

1341
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:45,610
Turn around.

1342
01:00:45,655 --> 01:00:47,350
Get him a bottle of--

1343
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:49,415
Get him some maple syrup.

1344
01:00:49,459 --> 01:00:51,825
Stick this card on it
and put it in his room.

1345
01:00:51,861 --> 01:00:54,489
- Who?
- Joe, the writer!

1346
01:00:55,532 --> 01:00:57,363
Joe, the writer,
maple syrup, yes, sir.

1347
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,800
Grows on trees.

1348
01:00:59,836 --> 01:01:02,703
Actually, it's an extract
of the tree.

1349
01:01:02,739 --> 01:01:04,172
Oh, bullshit.

1350
01:01:06,509 --> 01:01:09,740
I see some of our buddies got
themselves a part in the movie.

1351
01:01:09,779 --> 01:01:12,407
You see where Tom Miller
is playing the old farmer.

1352
01:01:12,449 --> 01:01:15,418
He's been playing the
old farmer now for 60 years.

1353
01:01:15,452 --> 01:01:18,478
I read for that part.
I did pretty well, too.

1354
01:01:18,521 --> 01:01:19,647
I bet you did.

1355
01:01:19,689 --> 01:01:21,554
But I couldn't remember
all the words.

1356
01:01:21,591 --> 01:01:23,456
Asked them would they
give me a second chance.

1357
01:01:23,493 --> 01:01:25,085
Ain't no second
chances in life.

1358
01:01:25,128 --> 01:01:27,494
- Is that true?
- The only second chance we get

1359
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:30,158
is to make the same
mistake twice.

1360
01:01:43,113 --> 01:01:45,104
The only...

1361
01:01:45,148 --> 01:01:48,743
second chance...

1362
01:01:48,785 --> 01:01:51,049
is the chance...

1363
01:01:51,087 --> 01:01:53,282
to make the same--

1364
01:02:17,981 --> 01:02:20,575
Okay, you're going
to be all right.

1365
01:02:27,023 --> 01:02:28,422
So that happened.

1366
01:02:28,458 --> 01:02:29,686
Are you all right?

1367
01:02:31,061 --> 01:02:33,962
- Am I all right?
- Yeah.

1368
01:02:36,433 --> 01:02:38,765
Well, I'm going
to tell you something.

1369
01:02:38,802 --> 01:02:40,292
We have to get her
out of here.

1370
01:02:40,336 --> 01:02:41,803
Who?

1371
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:50,238
- Are you all right?
- What?

1372
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,612
You gotta get out of here.

1373
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:55,178
All right.

1374
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:58,748
No.

1375
01:02:59,823 --> 01:03:01,791
You gotta get out of here.

1376
01:03:03,193 --> 01:03:04,490
Oh.

1377
01:03:05,929 --> 01:03:07,191
Oh.

1378
01:03:08,331 --> 01:03:09,593
Okay.

1379
01:03:19,809 --> 01:03:22,209
But here's the kicker--

1380
01:03:22,245 --> 01:03:23,735
Do you have a cigarette?

1381
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:24,872
What?

1382
01:03:26,616 --> 01:03:28,015
No, forget about it.

1383
01:03:45,168 --> 01:03:47,159
No, he's fine, Howie,
he's going to be fine.

1384
01:03:47,203 --> 01:03:49,296
He got knocked
around a little bit.

1385
01:03:49,339 --> 01:03:51,864
You're going to be fine.
I'll stop by tomorrow.

1386
01:03:51,908 --> 01:03:54,035
Thanks for your help.

1387
01:03:54,077 --> 01:03:55,374
It's what I do
for a living.

1388
01:03:55,411 --> 01:03:58,778
Seriously, thank you
for helping us out.

1389
01:03:58,815 --> 01:04:01,409
Believe it or not,
I've seen it all before.

1390
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,385
Howie wants
to talk to you.

1391
01:04:07,457 --> 01:04:09,084
Hey, Howie.

1392
01:04:09,125 --> 01:04:10,114
I'm fine.

1393
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,957
I'll be ready Wed--

1394
01:04:11,995 --> 01:04:14,987
I'm here to make
a movie, don't worry--

1395
01:04:15,031 --> 01:04:17,795
Hey, pal, when did
I ever let you down be--

1396
01:04:17,834 --> 01:04:19,267
Okay, babe.

1397
01:04:19,302 --> 01:04:21,395
I love you, too.

1398
01:04:21,437 --> 01:04:24,304
He wants to talk
to you about the...

1399
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:27,605
Howie, I'm calling
you back, two minutes.

1400
01:04:27,644 --> 01:04:29,703
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1401
01:04:29,746 --> 01:04:31,714
I reached over to--
the girl had to be home.

1402
01:04:31,748 --> 01:04:33,238
I don't know,
a school night--

1403
01:04:33,283 --> 01:04:34,910
Bobby--

1404
01:04:34,951 --> 01:04:37,146
Everybody needs a hobby.

1405
01:04:39,789 --> 01:04:42,349
I wonder if I can take
a moment of your time.

1406
01:04:42,392 --> 01:04:43,552
I need a day off.

1407
01:04:43,593 --> 01:04:45,322
My wife is having
a rough time.

1408
01:04:45,361 --> 01:04:47,989
Thank you for keeping
me current.

1409
01:04:51,434 --> 01:04:53,493
Howie Gold, please.

1410
01:04:53,536 --> 01:04:55,197
Walt Price,
I was just on with him.

1411
01:04:55,238 --> 01:04:57,035
Walt?

1412
01:04:57,073 --> 01:04:58,131
He's fine.

1413
01:04:58,174 --> 01:05:00,608
If there's anything
I can do--

1414
01:05:00,643 --> 01:05:02,042
No no no,
you've done it.

1415
01:05:02,078 --> 01:05:03,705
Thank you.
It's going to be fine.

1416
01:05:03,746 --> 01:05:07,079
Howie, Walt here?
I'm sorry, it's crazy.

1417
01:05:07,116 --> 01:05:09,311
No no no, he's 110%.

1418
01:05:09,352 --> 01:05:12,981
He got banged on the head.
He got a shot of adrenaline.

1419
01:05:13,022 --> 01:05:15,217
What request for money?

1420
01:05:15,258 --> 01:05:17,954
Howie, what request--?
That Marty--?

1421
01:05:17,994 --> 01:05:19,359
Is Mr. Barrenger
in there?

1422
01:05:21,531 --> 01:05:24,022
Howie, I'm going
to call you right back.

1423
01:05:25,602 --> 01:05:27,695
It's really raining
out there, huh, officer?

1424
01:05:29,439 --> 01:05:30,599
I guess it is.

1425
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,972
Could I see
Mr. Barrenger, please?

1426
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,782
Okay, what is she,
1 9, 20?

1427
01:05:48,891 --> 01:05:52,054
- Oh, Christ!
- Look-- Okay. Okay.

1428
01:05:52,095 --> 01:05:54,495
You're driving...
countryside, so on.

1429
01:05:54,530 --> 01:05:56,259
You picked her up,
she was hitch hiking--

1430
01:05:56,299 --> 01:05:58,494
No, she hid in the back
of your car.

1431
01:05:58,534 --> 01:05:59,831
- It happens all the time.
- Wait wait wait.

1432
01:05:59,869 --> 01:06:01,632
Can I see
Mr. Barrenger, please?

1433
01:06:01,671 --> 01:06:03,571
Wait, we can't put her
in the car.

1434
01:06:03,606 --> 01:06:06,131
She gets it in her head
to sue or rape--

1435
01:06:06,175 --> 01:06:09,633
- She wasn't in the car.
- You were all alone.

1436
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:11,146
There's no witnesses.

1437
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:12,738
There's no witnesses, right?

1438
01:06:12,782 --> 01:06:15,080
No, just Joe.

1439
01:06:15,118 --> 01:06:16,142
Joe, the writer.

1440
01:06:16,185 --> 01:06:17,777
Just him and me.

1441
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:20,345
Then she wasn't
in the car. Say it.

1442
01:06:21,891 --> 01:06:23,722
She wasn't in the car.

1443
01:06:37,106 --> 01:06:38,471
Mr. Barrenger?

1444
01:06:38,508 --> 01:06:39,975
Yes?

1445
01:06:40,009 --> 01:06:41,203
I'm very sorry to--

1446
01:06:41,244 --> 01:06:42,802
What seems to be
the problem?

1447
01:06:42,845 --> 01:06:44,870
I have to ask you
some questions.

1448
01:06:49,719 --> 01:06:51,880
Do you have a valid
driver's license?

1449
01:06:51,921 --> 01:06:53,115
Of course he has.

1450
01:06:53,156 --> 01:06:54,680
Could I see it, please?

1451
01:06:56,059 --> 01:06:58,653
- What?
- Your driver's license.

1452
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:14,343
Were you
under the influence?

1453
01:07:15,511 --> 01:07:17,069
No.

1454
01:07:20,216 --> 01:07:22,184
And who was
driving the car?

1455
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:27,723
I was alone in the car.
I was driving the car.

1456
01:07:27,757 --> 01:07:29,156
Uh huh.

1457
01:07:29,192 --> 01:07:32,650
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger,
I'm very sorry.

1458
01:07:32,695 --> 01:07:35,095
In fact, I'm as sorry
as I can be, but--

1459
01:07:35,131 --> 01:07:36,564
I'm an attorney,
if there's anything

1460
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:37,793
you have to say
to Mr. Barrenger,

1461
01:07:37,834 --> 01:07:40,029
you can say it to me.

1462
01:07:40,069 --> 01:07:41,696
I have to give you
this ticket

1463
01:07:41,738 --> 01:07:43,296
for damage
to city property.

1464
01:07:43,339 --> 01:07:46,069
I'm really sorry, sir.
It's a formality.

1465
01:07:46,109 --> 01:07:47,440
You have to what?

1466
01:07:47,477 --> 01:07:48,501
It's a formality.

1467
01:07:48,544 --> 01:07:50,842
Any case of damage
to city prop--

1468
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,474
You hit the control box
of the new stop light

1469
01:07:53,516 --> 01:07:56,610
and they're going
to send you a bill.

1470
01:07:56,652 --> 01:07:59,143
They'll, uh--
These things happen.

1471
01:07:59,188 --> 01:08:01,418
I hope
you're all right.

1472
01:08:01,457 --> 01:08:05,257
Don't worry, but that's
so sweet of you.

1473
01:08:05,294 --> 01:08:08,388
If there's anything I can do
to make your stay more pleasant.

1474
01:08:12,301 --> 01:08:14,292
We appreciate
your concern, officer.

1475
01:08:14,337 --> 01:08:16,498
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all.

1476
01:08:16,539 --> 01:08:18,200
Yeah?

1477
01:08:19,409 --> 01:08:20,842
Hello, Mr. Mayor.

1478
01:08:20,877 --> 01:08:23,141
Walt Price.

1479
01:08:23,179 --> 01:08:24,373
No, no.

1480
01:08:25,615 --> 01:08:26,775
He's fine.

1481
01:08:28,584 --> 01:08:30,814
Well, he's right here.

1482
01:08:30,853 --> 01:08:32,912
You're not to see
that girl again.

1483
01:08:32,955 --> 01:08:34,650
Do you understand me?

1484
01:08:35,892 --> 01:08:37,086
Hello?

1485
01:08:37,126 --> 01:08:39,526
No, he's right here.
Would you like to--

1486
01:08:39,562 --> 01:08:42,053
Bob, are you
all right?

1487
01:08:47,837 --> 01:08:48,895
- Hi?
- Hi.

1488
01:08:48,938 --> 01:08:49,927
Where are you going?

1489
01:08:49,972 --> 01:08:53,908
- Going home.
- Going home? Yeah.

1490
01:08:56,679 --> 01:08:59,307
- I told them what you said.
- What?

1491
01:08:59,348 --> 01:09:01,145
I told them what you said
about the script.

1492
01:09:01,184 --> 01:09:03,846
I didn't say anything.
I was just talking out loud.

1493
01:09:03,886 --> 01:09:07,253
- How else can you talk?
- No, that's true.

1494
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:13,993
I told them you can't
portray with the picture

1495
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:16,828
what you're saying
with the words.

1496
01:09:16,866 --> 01:09:18,857
I don't know, the movies--
I don't know.

1497
01:09:18,901 --> 01:09:20,391
They should be
socially uplifting.

1498
01:09:20,436 --> 01:09:22,199
Why does she
have to show her--

1499
01:09:23,406 --> 01:09:24,395
What is this?

1500
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,533
Yes, sir,
Joseph Knight's print shop.

1501
01:09:26,576 --> 01:09:28,407
Vacant for 30 years.

1502
01:09:28,444 --> 01:09:31,242
- Is it?
- Yup, and it's for sale.

1503
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:35,243
You want to see it?

1504
01:09:35,284 --> 01:09:37,878
I have the key
in my store.

1505
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,013
I'd love to.

1506
01:09:55,438 --> 01:09:56,996
How's your movie star?

1507
01:09:57,039 --> 01:09:59,030
Gosh, you look nice.

1508
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:05,647
What?

1509
01:10:05,681 --> 01:10:08,241
What are you going to
do with it, the print shop?

1510
01:10:08,284 --> 01:10:10,775
Oh.

1511
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:20,724
It's wet out there.

1512
01:10:20,763 --> 01:10:23,493
Hey, slip into something
more comfortable.

1513
01:10:25,134 --> 01:10:27,466
So what would
you do with it?

1514
01:10:27,503 --> 01:10:28,401
The print shop?

1515
01:10:29,438 --> 01:10:31,963
Start back up
“The Waterford Sentinel.”

1516
01:10:32,008 --> 01:10:34,670
“The Waterford Sentinel”?

1517
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:36,268
Town newspaper.

1518
01:10:36,312 --> 01:10:37,472
I got it all worked out.

1519
01:10:37,513 --> 01:10:39,037
Yeah?

1520
01:10:39,081 --> 01:10:41,549
- Show you the plans?
- Sure.

1521
01:10:46,622 --> 01:10:50,319
1 865, Devil's Tail Press.

1522
01:10:50,359 --> 01:10:53,522
“The Waterford Sentinel,”
the voice of the mountains.

1523
01:10:54,597 --> 01:10:56,690
You shall not
bear false witness.

1524
01:11:02,371 --> 01:11:05,465
- The press still works?
- It did as of last week.

1525
01:11:05,508 --> 01:11:07,032
You printed
the poster here?

1526
01:11:07,076 --> 01:11:09,670
The best way I know
to get ink on your hands.

1527
01:11:12,114 --> 01:11:14,639
Well--

1528
01:11:14,684 --> 01:11:16,549
Oh my.

1529
01:11:16,586 --> 01:11:17,712
Life in the country.

1530
01:11:28,397 --> 01:11:31,628
The past comes
to our rescue once again.

1531
01:11:41,210 --> 01:11:44,543
Yeah, you could
print the newspaper here.

1532
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:46,980
That's something
a man could do.

1533
01:11:48,351 --> 01:11:50,546
You know what else
a man could do?

1534
01:11:51,587 --> 01:11:53,145
What?

1535
01:11:59,128 --> 01:12:00,823
One moment.

1536
01:12:02,498 --> 01:12:03,965
All right, out you go.
Don't come back.

1537
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,695
Go home, Bucky.
Go home, boy.

1538
01:12:11,774 --> 01:12:15,335
I left the keys inside
in my jacket.

1539
01:12:19,148 --> 01:12:20,843
Well--

1540
01:12:22,451 --> 01:12:25,716
I suppose
I should be...

1541
01:12:27,590 --> 01:12:28,921
heading home.

1542
01:12:28,958 --> 01:12:30,220
Evening, Annie.

1543
01:12:32,128 --> 01:12:33,618
Evening, Cal.

1544
01:12:33,663 --> 01:12:35,096
Got an umbrella?

1545
01:12:35,131 --> 01:12:36,189
No.

1546
01:12:36,232 --> 01:12:38,826
That's all right.

1547
01:12:38,868 --> 01:12:41,632
You can have my coat.
I'll walk you home.

1548
01:12:41,671 --> 01:12:43,070
Then you'll be wet.

1549
01:12:43,105 --> 01:12:46,336
I'm going off shift.
Come on, I'll walk you home.

1550
01:13:44,967 --> 01:13:48,198
People.
People, people, people.

1551
01:13:48,237 --> 01:13:50,671
Every movie's got to be
about something,

1552
01:13:50,706 --> 01:13:54,005
and it's got to be about
just one thing.

1553
01:13:54,043 --> 01:13:55,635
What is this movie about?

1554
01:13:55,678 --> 01:13:58,579
It's about what we always
said it was about.

1555
01:13:58,614 --> 01:14:02,607
We were lost, but now
we're back on the right track.

1556
01:14:02,651 --> 01:14:05,711
You see, what I'm saying?
The movie is about purity.

1557
01:14:05,755 --> 01:14:06,915
Barrenger:
I've always seen that.

1558
01:14:06,956 --> 01:14:08,253
So we don't show
your breasts,

1559
01:14:08,290 --> 01:14:09,882
we show
your reaction to it.

1560
01:14:09,925 --> 01:14:13,793
- I am so comfortable with that--
- It was Joe's idea.

1561
01:14:13,829 --> 01:14:15,456
And you were
exactly right.

1562
01:14:15,498 --> 01:14:17,659
- This is great work.
- Thank you so much.

1563
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:19,759
We're not out of the woods.
I need that dead horse scene.

1564
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:22,938
I have Mr. Barrenger's
tuna BLT.

1565
01:14:22,972 --> 01:14:23,802
Thank you.

1566
01:14:23,839 --> 01:14:25,807
I tried to take it
to him in his room--

1567
01:14:25,841 --> 01:14:26,899
I think he's moved.

1568
01:14:29,178 --> 01:14:32,409
You know what Walt said
makes a lot of sense.

1569
01:14:33,616 --> 01:14:37,518
Listen, the audience isn't
coming to see your breasts.

1570
01:14:37,553 --> 01:14:39,180
They're coming
to see your acting.

1571
01:14:39,221 --> 01:14:42,156
- What are you doing this evening?
- I'm having dinner with Walt.

1572
01:14:42,191 --> 01:14:43,624
- Do you want to come?
- Do you mind?

1573
01:14:43,659 --> 01:14:47,459
- Not at all, you kidding me?
- Isn't she a trip?

1574
01:14:47,496 --> 01:14:49,589
We're going to have
some local food,

1575
01:14:49,632 --> 01:14:51,896
some roadhouse--
Joe, wanna go?

1576
01:14:51,934 --> 01:14:53,333
Got a date.

1577
01:14:53,369 --> 01:14:55,234
Already he's learned
how to write a movie

1578
01:14:55,271 --> 01:14:57,330
and he's found some girl
to get his toes curled.

1579
01:14:57,373 --> 01:14:59,398
- You're a monster!
- Too kind.

1580
01:14:59,441 --> 01:15:00,601
Quit your kidding.

1581
01:15:00,643 --> 01:15:02,201
How are we coming
with the dead horse scene?

1582
01:15:02,244 --> 01:15:03,973
You can't actually
kill the horse.

1583
01:15:04,013 --> 01:15:05,708
Oh, fuck me.

1584
01:15:08,217 --> 01:15:11,448
Yes, yes, I'm trying.

1585
01:15:13,856 --> 01:15:15,517
When is your mom coming?

1586
01:15:15,558 --> 01:15:17,355
Oh.

1587
01:15:17,393 --> 01:15:19,224
What did the midwife say?

1588
01:15:19,261 --> 01:15:20,626
Where are we
going to dinner?

1589
01:15:20,663 --> 01:15:21,994
Did you get
a reservation?

1590
01:15:22,031 --> 01:15:23,259
You were going
to book us--

1591
01:15:23,299 --> 01:15:25,324
Where is my schedule?
Where we going to dinner?

1592
01:15:25,367 --> 01:15:26,595
What's your problem?

1593
01:15:26,635 --> 01:15:27,897
My wife's
having a baby.

1594
01:15:27,937 --> 01:15:29,336
Is that on
the call sheet?

1595
01:15:29,371 --> 01:15:32,829
Or is that
personal business?

1596
01:15:32,875 --> 01:15:34,365
Oh, Christ, Marty!

1597
01:15:34,410 --> 01:15:35,468
Are we paying you?

1598
01:15:35,511 --> 01:15:36,910
I--

1599
01:15:40,683 --> 01:15:43,243
She didn't even finish
knitting me the sweater.

1600
01:15:43,285 --> 01:15:44,513
Morning, Doc.

1601
01:15:44,553 --> 01:15:46,077
Morning.

1602
01:15:46,121 --> 01:15:48,021
What are you
doing here, Doug?

1603
01:15:48,057 --> 01:15:49,490
I thought you started
out the day

1604
01:15:49,525 --> 01:15:50,822
with that pernicious
caffeine.

1605
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:52,725
Kiss my ass.

1606
01:15:52,761 --> 01:15:54,388
He's had a hard day.

1607
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:56,159
Ann deserted him
for some guy on the movie.

1608
01:15:56,198 --> 01:15:57,631
Well, they don't
always leave

1609
01:15:57,666 --> 01:15:58,758
with the ones
they come in with.

1610
01:15:58,801 --> 01:16:00,268
Big day last night.

1611
01:16:00,302 --> 01:16:01,997
Hoped to tell you.

1612
01:16:02,037 --> 01:16:03,800
Didn't I pick
the fragments of glass

1613
01:16:03,839 --> 01:16:07,297
out of Bob Barrenger's
actual head myself?

1614
01:16:07,343 --> 01:16:08,810
- Morning, Carla.
- Morning, Uncle Ron.

1615
01:16:08,844 --> 01:16:10,311
Morning, Carla.

1616
01:16:10,346 --> 01:16:13,315
Morning, Doc.
Morning, Doug.

1617
01:16:13,349 --> 01:16:14,873
A cluster of events.

1618
01:16:14,917 --> 01:16:16,748
Don't see something
for 1 0 years,

1619
01:16:16,785 --> 01:16:19,083
all of a sudden,
three times in a night.

1620
01:16:20,289 --> 01:16:21,916
Who got glass in their head?

1621
01:16:23,325 --> 01:16:24,314
What?

1622
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,225
Who got glass in their head?

1623
01:16:26,262 --> 01:16:29,595
Oh, uh, Barrenger,

1624
01:16:29,632 --> 01:16:33,124
and another fellow
who works on the movie,

1625
01:16:33,168 --> 01:16:34,396
a cameraman.

1626
01:16:34,436 --> 01:16:35,733
You said three.

1627
01:16:36,772 --> 01:16:39,297
Did I?
I think you're mistaken.

1628
01:16:45,147 --> 01:16:46,478
I wasn't in the car.

1629
01:16:46,515 --> 01:16:47,948
We'll just
see about that.

1630
01:16:47,983 --> 01:16:49,780
Doug, she said
she wasn't in the car.

1631
01:16:49,818 --> 01:16:52,286
Jack, it's time
to rip the band-aid off!

1632
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:58,159
Mister,
you're going to jail.

1633
01:16:59,194 --> 01:17:01,788
I didn't know
it was illegal.

1634
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:03,422
I beg you pardon.

1635
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:06,198
Could somebody
explain to me--

1636
01:17:06,235 --> 01:17:08,294
We've got to turn
this hotel upside down.

1637
01:17:08,337 --> 01:17:09,736
A-ha?

1638
01:17:09,772 --> 01:17:10,932
Arrest him.

1639
01:17:10,973 --> 01:17:12,065
What's the problem?

1640
01:17:12,107 --> 01:17:13,768
- Arrest him.
- For what?

1641
01:17:13,809 --> 01:17:15,572
Conspiracy
in statutory rape.

1642
01:17:15,611 --> 01:17:17,135
Conspiracy
in statutory rape?

1643
01:17:17,179 --> 01:17:18,737
Okay, of whom?

1644
01:17:18,781 --> 01:17:21,045
- This young woman.
- Nobody touched me.

1645
01:17:21,083 --> 01:17:22,744
- Who was it that raped you?
- Nobody.

1646
01:17:22,785 --> 01:17:24,116
Well, what's the beef?

1647
01:17:25,154 --> 01:17:27,122
She was in the car
with Bob Barrenger.

1648
01:17:27,156 --> 01:17:29,420
She was injured coming home
from a love tryst.

1649
01:17:29,458 --> 01:17:30,618
You were in the car
with Bob?

1650
01:17:30,659 --> 01:17:32,627
No.

1651
01:17:33,295 --> 01:17:35,320
Then what is the--

1652
01:17:35,364 --> 01:17:37,924
Then what is this,
you son of a bitch?

1653
01:17:37,967 --> 01:17:39,559
Because if you haven't
heard about the laws

1654
01:17:39,601 --> 01:17:41,296
of malicious prosecution,
you're about to.

1655
01:17:41,337 --> 01:17:43,134
Don't flinch
while I'm talking to you,

1656
01:17:43,172 --> 01:17:44,696
you speed trap shaygits.

1657
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:49,006
The kid was not in the car.
She says she wasn't in the car.

1658
01:17:49,044 --> 01:17:50,705
No one says
that she was in the car.

1659
01:17:50,746 --> 01:17:55,080
You have no case. So I'm
not playing patsy with you.

1660
01:17:55,117 --> 01:17:56,880
Look me in the eyes.

1661
01:17:56,919 --> 01:18:00,480
I made 11 million bucks last year
and I don't like being trifled with.

1662
01:18:00,522 --> 01:18:03,218
Now I think the better part
of valor is for you to step away.

1663
01:18:03,258 --> 01:18:05,158
Or you, your kids,
and your grandchildren

1664
01:18:05,194 --> 01:18:06,855
will die in poverty.

1665
01:18:06,895 --> 01:18:09,090
What do you think?

1666
01:18:09,131 --> 01:18:11,759
We have a movie to make.
Can we all pull together here?

1667
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:13,199
Have a cigar.

1668
01:18:13,235 --> 01:18:14,634
There you go.

1669
01:18:18,474 --> 01:18:20,908
In a communist country
if a fellow makes an accusation

1670
01:18:20,943 --> 01:18:22,171
these are the things
that occur--

1671
01:18:22,211 --> 01:18:24,577
It's a mistake.
It's all over.

1672
01:18:24,613 --> 01:18:26,547
I'm sorry that
we've inconvenienced you.

1673
01:18:26,582 --> 01:18:27,708
I wasn't in the car.

1674
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:29,615
We know that you weren't.
We're all aware of that.

1675
01:18:30,786 --> 01:18:33,983
Because you treat me
like a child.

1676
01:18:34,023 --> 01:18:35,581
You treat me like a child.

1677
01:18:35,624 --> 01:18:38,115
That's why I can't come.

1678
01:18:48,604 --> 01:18:50,003
Uh...

1679
01:18:50,039 --> 01:18:52,439
He took advantage of me?

1680
01:18:54,109 --> 01:18:56,270
I got to admit
I'm a bit confused.

1681
01:18:56,311 --> 01:18:57,676
I'm going
to straighten you out.

1682
01:18:57,713 --> 01:18:59,237
Officer, will you
see these folks home?

1683
01:18:59,281 --> 01:19:00,441
Yes, sir.

1684
01:19:00,482 --> 01:19:02,347
She's upset
and impressionable.

1685
01:19:02,384 --> 01:19:04,011
Get me my law book
and the mayor.

1686
01:19:04,053 --> 01:19:06,021
I was talking
to that girl in there.

1687
01:19:06,055 --> 01:19:09,115
- Overcome by the events...
- I never touched her...

1688
01:19:09,158 --> 01:19:11,888
- A high powered fantasy.
- On my mother's grave.

1689
01:19:11,927 --> 01:19:12,894
We were talking
about the script.

1690
01:19:12,928 --> 01:19:15,192
I think you might
want to get dressed.

1691
01:19:15,230 --> 01:19:16,857
I really don't
understand the problem.

1692
01:19:16,899 --> 01:19:17,866
- Wally--
- All right.

1693
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:19,663
Carla: I want to go home.

1694
01:19:19,701 --> 01:19:21,168
If somebody
would enlighten me.

1695
01:19:21,203 --> 01:19:22,363
That's what
I'm here for.

1696
01:19:22,404 --> 01:19:23,462
Carla.

1697
01:19:25,274 --> 01:19:26,935
Adolescence is
a difficult time.

1698
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:28,499
It is a time of dreams.

1699
01:19:28,544 --> 01:19:30,068
Many young folks
dream of Hollywood.

1700
01:19:30,112 --> 01:19:31,044
I know I did.

1701
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:33,105
And here Hollywood
has come to you.

1702
01:19:33,148 --> 01:19:35,673
She told me
she was studying Phonics.

1703
01:19:35,717 --> 01:19:37,912
I'm going to need
her birth certificate.

1704
01:19:37,953 --> 01:19:39,921
Carla, I swear that girl
in my room--

1705
01:19:39,955 --> 01:19:41,718
Be quiet, Bob.

1706
01:19:41,757 --> 01:19:43,725
It's called
a script conference.

1707
01:19:43,759 --> 01:19:45,522
You have
a fertile mind.

1708
01:19:45,561 --> 01:19:47,392
We use people like that
in our work.

1709
01:19:47,429 --> 01:19:49,454
You said you were
doing your homework!

1710
01:19:49,498 --> 01:19:51,557
Because if that's not true,
you're grounded?

1711
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,433
Can we get him
home, please?

1712
01:19:54,470 --> 01:19:56,461
- I--
- I don't think so.

1713
01:19:56,505 --> 01:19:59,668
If you think I'm fooling,
wait until I get you home.

1714
01:19:59,708 --> 01:20:01,005
It occurs to me

1715
01:20:01,043 --> 01:20:02,670
that there's a part
in our movie--

1716
01:20:02,711 --> 01:20:04,338
I would appreciate it if you
wouldn't speak to the complainant.

1717
01:20:04,379 --> 01:20:07,246
There's part, a young girl--
Am I right?

1718
01:20:07,282 --> 01:20:10,376
Here, statutory rape,
blah blah blah.

1719
01:20:10,419 --> 01:20:12,944
Carla, you know at the beginning
of any relationship--

1720
01:20:12,988 --> 01:20:15,718
Keep him away from me
until the end of time.

1721
01:20:15,757 --> 01:20:18,225
Unsupported testimony
of the complainant--

1722
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:19,659
You travel with
the statutes on rape?

1723
01:20:19,695 --> 01:20:20,889
Carla.

1724
01:20:20,929 --> 01:20:24,262
Conflicting statements,
a coerced accusation--

1725
01:20:24,299 --> 01:20:27,132
You got a complainant
who's worthless.

1726
01:20:27,169 --> 01:20:29,501
You've got no witness
that puts her in the car,

1727
01:20:29,538 --> 01:20:30,800
and you've got no backing.

1728
01:20:30,839 --> 01:20:33,831
Yeah? Maybe we better
talk to the mayor.

1729
01:20:33,876 --> 01:20:36,208
- Hello, Mr. Mayor.
- Is that the mayor?

1730
01:20:36,245 --> 01:20:39,840
- It's just an unfortunate--
- Is he cool or angry?

1731
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:50,649
So, today we got lucky.

1732
01:20:50,692 --> 01:20:53,684
If your memory was as long as
your dick you'd be in good shape.

1733
01:20:53,729 --> 01:20:56,254
How long since you almost
went to jail for this shit?

1734
01:20:56,298 --> 01:20:58,596
How could she turn on me?
I thought she liked me.

1735
01:20:58,634 --> 01:21:02,001
Can we keep our pants buttoned
and get out of this in one piece?

1736
01:21:02,037 --> 01:21:03,834
- I'm ready.
- Well, stay ready.

1737
01:21:03,872 --> 01:21:06,363
- Stay by yourself in your room.
- What am I going to do for fun?

1738
01:21:06,408 --> 01:21:08,239
Why don't you
learn your lines?

1739
01:21:08,277 --> 01:21:10,302
-I know my lines.
- You do?

1740
01:21:10,345 --> 01:21:12,939
I just don't know
what order they come in.

1741
01:21:12,981 --> 01:21:15,074
I'll tell you what--

1742
01:21:15,117 --> 01:21:17,210
Let's ditch these
cockamamie locals.

1743
01:21:17,252 --> 01:21:20,813
- They play too rough.
- Let's go to some roadhouse.

1744
01:21:20,856 --> 01:21:22,517
Just us.
You, me and Claire.

1745
01:21:22,558 --> 01:21:25,186
We'll drink
a bottle of wine.

1746
01:21:25,227 --> 01:21:27,695
- Now you're talking.
- Just get in the car and go.

1747
01:21:27,729 --> 01:21:30,493
Yeah,
someplace real.

1748
01:21:30,532 --> 01:21:31,829
You and me, pal.

1749
01:21:34,436 --> 01:21:35,733
What are you
doing for fun?

1750
01:21:35,771 --> 01:21:37,796
I went for a ride
on a tractor.

1751
01:21:37,839 --> 01:21:39,670
- Get out.
- Nope.

1752
01:21:39,708 --> 01:21:41,733
You went for a ride
on a tractor?

1753
01:21:41,777 --> 01:21:43,802
Yup, last night.

1754
01:21:55,857 --> 01:21:58,223
Hey, Molly, will you
get me a ham sandwich?

1755
01:22:26,922 --> 01:22:28,822
Hey, you got
to eat a pack of dirt.

1756
01:22:28,857 --> 01:22:30,688
My wife just went
into labor.

1757
01:22:30,726 --> 01:22:32,785
Half a buck
I'd close it down.

1758
01:22:32,828 --> 01:22:35,194
It's perfidy.

1759
01:22:35,230 --> 01:22:37,391
You got Barrenger
molesting little girls.

1760
01:22:37,432 --> 01:22:39,593
- He should be put in jail.
- I'd put him in jail.

1761
01:22:39,635 --> 01:22:41,660
- You should.
- If I had a witness I would.

1762
01:22:41,703 --> 01:22:43,068
A witness to what?

1763
01:22:43,105 --> 01:22:45,903
To the rape.
Even to the accident.

1764
01:22:45,941 --> 01:22:47,135
You mean with White?

1765
01:22:47,175 --> 01:22:48,574
What?

1766
01:22:48,610 --> 01:22:50,737
You mean you need a witness
in addition to White?

1767
01:22:50,779 --> 01:22:52,542
- Who's White?
- The writer.

1768
01:22:52,581 --> 01:22:54,981
- He saw the accident?
- Sure.

1769
01:22:55,017 --> 01:22:56,484
He saw the girl
in the car?

1770
01:22:56,518 --> 01:22:58,418
You bet he did.

1771
01:23:08,263 --> 01:23:10,891
Well, that's
what I'm talking about.

1772
01:23:37,392 --> 01:23:39,860
Don't you touch that.

1773
01:23:56,345 --> 01:23:57,642
Excuse me.

1774
01:24:02,117 --> 01:24:05,382
- I want them gone.
- I signed the permit.

1775
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:08,218
- I want them thrown in jail.
- Sherry. Sherry.

1776
01:24:09,257 --> 01:24:11,885
I want them to starve
in a great big hole

1777
01:24:11,927 --> 01:24:14,122
and I'm going to
go there and piss on them.

1778
01:24:14,162 --> 01:24:15,652
What?

1779
01:24:19,568 --> 01:24:21,593
Get me the state police.

1780
01:24:25,507 --> 01:24:27,634
The sleepy little town
of Waterford, Vermont,

1781
01:24:27,676 --> 01:24:29,667
where movie star,
Bob Barrenger,

1782
01:24:29,711 --> 01:24:32,339
fresh with his troubles
with the law last year,

1783
01:24:32,381 --> 01:24:34,576
is once again
in hot water,

1784
01:24:34,616 --> 01:24:37,050
involved in a car crash
with a young,

1785
01:24:37,085 --> 01:24:38,780
a very young, woman.

1786
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:41,380
Mr. Barrenger is being
arraigned today

1787
01:24:41,423 --> 01:24:44,256
for moral turpitude
and several other--

1788
01:24:44,292 --> 01:24:46,055
Make sure you
got your facts straight.

1789
01:24:46,094 --> 01:24:48,790
You step off the line
and I'm gonna sue you personally.

1790
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:50,923
Bobby!

1791
01:24:50,966 --> 01:24:53,059
Good morning, where are you
taking Mr. Barrenger?

1792
01:24:53,101 --> 01:24:55,763
We're looking for
a Mr. Joseph Turner White.

1793
01:24:55,804 --> 01:24:57,271
- What are you doing?
- He's under arrest.

1794
01:24:57,305 --> 01:25:00,206
I'm his lawyer.
And you must be Perry Mason.

1795
01:25:00,242 --> 01:25:01,209
Guess what?

1796
01:25:01,243 --> 01:25:03,803
You are one half step
from a world of hurt.

1797
01:25:03,845 --> 01:25:06,211
How diverting? The mayor's
going to have your ass.

1798
01:25:06,248 --> 01:25:07,806
- Can I watch?
- You guess what?

1799
01:25:07,849 --> 01:25:08,816
The mayor sent me.

1800
01:25:08,850 --> 01:25:10,841
I have your Mr. Barrenger
with a history--

1801
01:25:10,886 --> 01:25:12,444
A history of nothing.
He was acquitted.

1802
01:25:12,487 --> 01:25:14,250
Moral turpitude.
What are you waiting for?

1803
01:25:14,289 --> 01:25:16,553
- Don't say anything.
- Nothing happened.

1804
01:25:17,325 --> 01:25:20,954
You're on my home court. I got
the mayor and the town behind me.

1805
01:25:20,996 --> 01:25:22,463
And forget making
your movie.

1806
01:25:22,497 --> 01:25:24,624
I may own the studio
when I get through.

1807
01:25:24,666 --> 01:25:26,793
I got a civil suit.
I got rape. I got collusion.

1808
01:25:26,835 --> 01:25:28,234
You got nothing.
You don't have a witness?

1809
01:25:28,270 --> 01:25:30,830
And I have a witness?
Your Mr. White saw the crime.

1810
01:25:30,872 --> 01:25:32,567
- He told you that?
- He didn't have to.

1811
01:25:32,607 --> 01:25:34,040
I need to talk to him.
Will you excuse me?

1812
01:25:34,075 --> 01:25:35,064
Oh, you're
his attorney, too?

1813
01:25:35,110 --> 01:25:36,805
- Later for you, pal.
- Okay.

1814
01:25:38,447 --> 01:25:40,244
Marty!

1815
01:25:40,282 --> 01:25:42,182
Bob's in the slammer.
You do that, I'll do this.

1816
01:25:42,217 --> 01:25:43,241
What are you
going to do?

1817
01:25:43,285 --> 01:25:44,684
Go be with him.

1818
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:46,846
- Hey, Marty.
- Hi, pal.

1819
01:25:46,888 --> 01:25:49,413
I need to talk to you.

1820
01:26:08,043 --> 01:26:10,739
Okay.

1821
01:26:10,779 --> 01:26:12,576
He's going to give you
a couple of minutes.

1822
01:26:14,015 --> 01:26:15,573
What's it all about?

1823
01:26:15,617 --> 01:26:16,982
I saw the accident.

1824
01:26:17,018 --> 01:26:18,508
How do they know that?
You told them?

1825
01:26:18,553 --> 01:26:20,453
- No.
- What did you say to them?

1826
01:26:20,489 --> 01:26:21,922
I didn't say anything
to them.

1827
01:26:21,957 --> 01:26:24,289
Good.
Come here.

1828
01:26:24,326 --> 01:26:25,486
That's very good.

1829
01:26:28,230 --> 01:26:29,197
Have a seat.

1830
01:26:31,066 --> 01:26:33,330
How do you know
you saw it?

1831
01:26:33,368 --> 01:26:36,166
- I don't understand.
- Perhaps you didn't see it.

1832
01:26:37,606 --> 01:26:39,005
Perhaps you didn't
see it.

1833
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:40,632
I saw it.
I was there.

1834
01:26:40,675 --> 01:26:43,143
You were there...

1835
01:26:43,178 --> 01:26:44,475
at 1 0:35?

1836
01:26:46,548 --> 01:26:48,413
Yeah, I was walking
down the street

1837
01:26:48,450 --> 01:26:52,546
and I remember...
I was writing--

1838
01:26:52,587 --> 01:26:53,986
What glasses
were you wearing?

1839
01:26:54,022 --> 01:26:55,580
Were you wearing
your reading glasses?

1840
01:26:56,858 --> 01:26:58,052
I--

1841
01:26:58,093 --> 01:26:59,287
You told me
you were writing.

1842
01:26:59,327 --> 01:27:00,885
Don't you wear your reading
glasses to write?

1843
01:27:00,929 --> 01:27:02,157
Isn't that
what you told me?

1844
01:27:02,197 --> 01:27:03,494
Hold on.

1845
01:27:05,667 --> 01:27:06,634
Yeah?

1846
01:27:07,869 --> 01:27:08,858
Yeah.

1847
01:27:10,171 --> 01:27:12,401
I've got to go
to the jail.

1848
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:13,407
Be strong.

1849
01:27:20,715 --> 01:27:22,774
What am I gonna do?

1850
01:27:22,817 --> 01:27:25,115
You gotta tell them you saw
the accident, don't you?

1851
01:27:25,153 --> 01:27:27,121
I can't do that.

1852
01:27:27,155 --> 01:27:30,181
If I tell them,
they'll try Bob for rape

1853
01:27:30,225 --> 01:27:31,920
and it will
ruin his career.

1854
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:33,587
But that's what happened.

1855
01:27:33,628 --> 01:27:35,152
But they'll stop the movie.

1856
01:27:35,196 --> 01:27:37,687
Maybe there'll be
other movies.

1857
01:27:37,732 --> 01:27:39,199
They'll blackball me.

1858
01:27:40,368 --> 01:27:42,700
Carla was in the car.

1859
01:27:42,737 --> 01:27:44,329
What am I gonna do?

1860
01:27:53,515 --> 01:27:54,846
A lot of hubbub
in the street.

1861
01:27:54,883 --> 01:27:56,680
I'm taking you
the back way.

1862
01:28:04,626 --> 01:28:06,287
Two minutes?

1863
01:28:06,328 --> 01:28:08,353
Let's speak English.
You gotta help the side.

1864
01:28:08,396 --> 01:28:09,454
You want me to lie?

1865
01:28:09,497 --> 01:28:11,658
To the contrary,
I want you to tell the truth.

1866
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:14,601
Truth is you can't tell me
that you saw the thing.

1867
01:28:14,636 --> 01:28:17,730
You don't remember
which glasses you've got on.

1868
01:28:17,772 --> 01:28:21,674
If you're not sure, then they've
got nothing and Bob walks free.

1869
01:28:21,710 --> 01:28:24,270
This is a damn roust
and everybody knows it.

1870
01:28:24,312 --> 01:28:27,440
The guy wants to
make a name for himself.

1871
01:28:27,482 --> 01:28:30,713
If we let him do that, then
we're being false to our community.

1872
01:28:30,752 --> 01:28:32,242
Do you understand?
To our world.

1873
01:28:32,287 --> 01:28:34,312
And you're a part
of that world.

1874
01:28:34,356 --> 01:28:36,347
I got a five picture deal
with the studio.

1875
01:28:36,391 --> 01:28:38,086
You stick with me,
you write one, two more--

1876
01:28:38,126 --> 01:28:40,890
You stick with me,
you'll direct the next one.

1877
01:28:40,929 --> 01:28:42,590
The girl wasn't
in the car.

1878
01:28:42,631 --> 01:28:44,360
You got to go.

1879
01:29:33,581 --> 01:29:36,049
Joseph Turner White.

1880
01:29:48,863 --> 01:29:50,228
Hear ye, hear ye.

1881
01:29:50,265 --> 01:29:52,529
Sixth District Court
in for the county of Codona,

1882
01:29:52,567 --> 01:29:54,125
State of Vermont.

1883
01:29:54,169 --> 01:29:56,729
The Honorable James Addison
Flynn presiding.

1884
01:29:56,771 --> 01:29:59,740
All those with business before
this honorable court draw near

1885
01:29:59,774 --> 01:30:01,435
you will be heard.

1886
01:30:02,510 --> 01:30:05,570
Mr. White, this is
a simple matter of--

1887
01:30:08,016 --> 01:30:10,507
All we need is a simple
fact or two.

1888
01:30:11,653 --> 01:30:13,587
You're going to give your
recollections of the accident

1889
01:30:13,621 --> 01:30:15,088
at the corner
of State and Main.

1890
01:30:15,123 --> 01:30:16,988
Would you please
swear him in?

1891
01:30:17,025 --> 01:30:19,118
Raise your right hand.

1892
01:30:21,663 --> 01:30:23,255
Do you swear
to tell the truth,

1893
01:30:23,298 --> 01:30:25,391
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth,

1894
01:30:25,433 --> 01:30:26,730
so help you God?

1895
01:30:29,471 --> 01:30:30,733
I do.

1896
01:30:32,140 --> 01:30:34,574
The arraignment, as we said,
of Bob Barrenger.

1897
01:30:34,609 --> 01:30:36,804
The Bob Barrenger,
star of “The Old Mill”

1898
01:30:36,845 --> 01:30:39,780
about to begin shooting here
in picturesque and sleepy--

1899
01:30:39,814 --> 01:30:42,647
or we should say,
formerly sleepy--

1900
01:30:42,684 --> 01:30:45,881
Yes, yes...

1901
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:47,854
Yes, it's Claire Wellesley.

1902
01:30:47,889 --> 01:30:49,288
We're going to try
to get a look at her.

1903
01:30:49,324 --> 01:30:51,884
Let's go.
Stay with me.

1904
01:31:14,249 --> 01:31:15,409
Morning, Doc.

1905
01:31:15,450 --> 01:31:17,782
Morning, Billy.
Where are you headed?

1906
01:31:17,819 --> 01:31:19,252
Down to the corner
to see the ruckus.

1907
01:31:19,287 --> 01:31:22,154
Watch the curbs now.

1908
01:31:22,190 --> 01:31:23,179
Good morning.

1909
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:27,151
Where are you off to?

1910
01:31:27,195 --> 01:31:28,162
Uh...

1911
01:31:29,798 --> 01:31:31,231
I'm leaving.

1912
01:31:31,266 --> 01:31:32,358
Why?

1913
01:31:33,401 --> 01:31:35,767
I perjured myself.

1914
01:31:37,005 --> 01:31:41,101
I told a lie,
and I ruined my life.

1915
01:31:41,142 --> 01:31:42,700
That's what I did.

1916
01:31:44,212 --> 01:31:46,874
I don't suppose you could
help me with that, could you?

1917
01:31:48,082 --> 01:31:50,676
Turn back the clock
or something?

1918
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:54,047
You know,
to give me back my...

1919
01:31:55,490 --> 01:31:57,355
give me back
my purity?

1920
01:31:57,392 --> 01:31:59,826
I don't suppose you could wave your
magic wand

1921
01:31:59,861 --> 01:32:01,055
and do that, could you?

1922
01:32:02,630 --> 01:32:04,962
For what is truth?

1923
01:32:06,601 --> 01:32:09,764
Isn't that the thing,
what is true?

1924
01:32:09,804 --> 01:32:11,499
The truth is
you never should trust

1925
01:32:11,539 --> 01:32:13,234
anybody who wears a bow tie.

1926
01:32:13,274 --> 01:32:14,901
Here.

1927
01:32:16,411 --> 01:32:18,470
A cravat is supposed
to point down,

1928
01:32:18,513 --> 01:32:20,743
to accentuate
the genitals.

1929
01:32:20,782 --> 01:32:22,147
Why do you want
to trust somebody

1930
01:32:22,183 --> 01:32:25,550
whose tie points out
to accentuate his ears?

1931
01:32:28,389 --> 01:32:31,586
Aren't you supposed to set
an example for people?

1932
01:32:31,626 --> 01:32:32,991
Nope.

1933
01:32:33,027 --> 01:32:35,427
Just supposed to hold
their hands while they die.

1934
01:32:37,765 --> 01:32:39,596
What did you say
your problem was?

1935
01:32:39,634 --> 01:32:41,534
- Hi, Doc.
- Oh, morning, Chrissy.

1936
01:32:41,569 --> 01:32:43,196
How's the back?

1937
01:33:00,088 --> 01:33:02,420
I ruined my life.

1938
01:33:04,859 --> 01:33:07,555
Isn't that funny
you can actually do it

1939
01:33:07,595 --> 01:33:09,790
in one moment,
just like they say?

1940
01:33:11,099 --> 01:33:13,329
I ruined my life
back in that courthouse.

1941
01:33:14,502 --> 01:33:16,868
- What courthouse?
- The courthouse back in town.

1942
01:33:16,905 --> 01:33:18,497
The town ain't got
no courthouse.

1943
01:33:18,539 --> 01:33:19,836
What?

1944
01:33:19,874 --> 01:33:21,341
It ain't got
no courthouse.

1945
01:33:21,376 --> 01:33:23,970
Courthouse burned
down in 1 960.

1946
01:33:24,012 --> 01:33:25,980
Where do they hold court?

1947
01:33:26,014 --> 01:33:28,949
To hold court they have to--
science lab

1948
01:33:28,983 --> 01:33:30,314
at the high school.

1949
01:33:32,487 --> 01:33:35,422
Morning, Judge,
what brings you down here?

1950
01:33:35,456 --> 01:33:37,686
Supposed to be hearing
some deposition.

1951
01:33:37,725 --> 01:33:40,091
Some fool saw the accident
the other night.

1952
01:33:40,128 --> 01:33:41,254
Did the courthouse
burn down?

1953
01:33:41,296 --> 01:33:43,730
Courthouse burned
down 1 960.

1954
01:33:43,765 --> 01:33:45,858
Part of a spate of fires--

1955
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:47,731
old mill, courthouse--

1956
01:33:47,769 --> 01:33:50,636
Supposed to have been set
by some deranged teenager.

1957
01:33:50,672 --> 01:33:53,835
Gave rise to
the Waterford Huskies.

1958
01:35:09,350 --> 01:35:11,614
I thought you needed
to get it out of your system.

1959
01:35:14,589 --> 01:35:16,557
The American system
of jurisprudence,

1960
01:35:16,591 --> 01:35:18,616
which differs from ours
in the following respects:

1961
01:35:18,659 --> 01:35:19,990
They have their
Bill of Rights,

1962
01:35:20,028 --> 01:35:22,496
equal perhaps
to our Magna Carta.

1963
01:35:24,432 --> 01:35:25,558
What are you
gonna do?

1964
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:26,999
Tell the truth.

1965
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:42,080
I would now like
to address you

1966
01:35:42,116 --> 01:35:45,313
on the responsibility
of the prosecutor's office.

1967
01:35:45,353 --> 01:35:47,583
The job is not
always a happy one,

1968
01:35:47,622 --> 01:35:49,249
but there comes
a time now and then

1969
01:35:49,290 --> 01:35:52,157
in the life of the community
for the display of force.

1970
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:54,894
So be it.

1971
01:35:54,929 --> 01:35:58,160
Now it falls to my lot
to join the fray,

1972
01:35:58,199 --> 01:36:00,394
to join in battle
and to exterminate

1973
01:36:00,435 --> 01:36:02,266
by means of this
criminal indictment,

1974
01:36:02,303 --> 01:36:04,396
to exterminate
the vermin...

1975
01:36:04,439 --> 01:36:06,373
He's got toilet
paper on his face

1976
01:36:06,407 --> 01:36:08,341
and he's sweating
like a pig.

1977
01:36:08,376 --> 01:36:11,038
...a license granted him
by a gracious nation,

1978
01:36:11,245 --> 01:36:13,509
who spew filth
and degradation

1979
01:36:13,548 --> 01:36:14,981
and who--

1980
01:36:16,551 --> 01:36:19,111
Damnit.
Who pollute the minds--

1981
01:36:19,153 --> 01:36:21,781
We're live in five minutes.
Do you need to clean up?

1982
01:36:21,823 --> 01:36:23,222
Yes, thank you.

1983
01:36:26,627 --> 01:36:28,026
Do something.

1984
01:36:28,062 --> 01:36:30,121
You tell me what to do.
I'll do it.

1985
01:36:30,164 --> 01:36:34,123
I was just paying off
my spread in Montana.

1986
01:36:37,371 --> 01:36:39,236
Excuse me, sorry.

1987
01:36:39,273 --> 01:36:40,831
I'm here to give
my deposition.

1988
01:36:40,875 --> 01:36:42,433
Joe?

1989
01:36:42,477 --> 01:36:44,308
Thank God.
It's up to you, pal.

1990
01:36:44,345 --> 01:36:46,404
- I'm out.
- I don't get you.

1991
01:36:46,447 --> 01:36:48,381
The girl was
in the car.

1992
01:36:48,416 --> 01:36:50,384
I treated you like a son,
or a nephew--

1993
01:36:50,418 --> 01:36:51,783
It's not about you--

1994
01:36:51,819 --> 01:36:53,047
No, what's it
about then?

1995
01:36:53,087 --> 01:36:55,055
I have to tell
the truth.

1996
01:36:55,089 --> 01:36:57,114
That is just so narrow.

1997
01:36:57,158 --> 01:36:59,023
The girl was in the car.

1998
01:36:59,060 --> 01:37:00,027
Then you're finished
in showbiz.

1999
01:37:00,061 --> 01:37:01,153
So be it.

2000
01:37:01,195 --> 01:37:02,492
And we're going to sue you
for a billion dollars.

2001
01:37:02,530 --> 01:37:03,929
What cause?

2002
01:37:03,965 --> 01:37:05,956
I don't need a cause.

2003
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,661
I just need a lawyer!

2004
01:37:07,702 --> 01:37:09,067
I'm a lawyer.

2005
01:37:09,103 --> 01:37:10,661
- Howie?
- Yeah.

2006
01:37:10,705 --> 01:37:12,764
Howie, what are you
doing here?

2007
01:37:12,807 --> 01:37:14,536
What am I doing here?

2008
01:37:14,575 --> 01:37:17,169
I just flew seven hours
because you asked me here.

2009
01:37:17,211 --> 01:37:18,303
What for?

2010
01:37:18,346 --> 01:37:20,007
For this, and I hope
you need it,

2011
01:37:20,047 --> 01:37:21,742
because it's coming
out of your budget.

2012
01:37:36,330 --> 01:37:37,422
Hi.

2013
01:37:37,465 --> 01:37:40,866
I would prefer it
if you didn't speak to me.

2014
01:37:40,902 --> 01:37:43,268
You know,

2015
01:37:43,304 --> 01:37:44,362
there's nothing
you could say

2016
01:37:44,405 --> 01:37:46,168
that could possibly
make a difference.

2017
01:37:46,207 --> 01:37:47,936
So why don't you
just save your breath?

2018
01:37:47,975 --> 01:37:50,068
Okay.

2019
01:37:52,313 --> 01:37:53,803
You forgot your case.

2020
01:37:56,017 --> 01:37:58,815
That's not my case.
That's your case.

2021
01:37:58,853 --> 01:38:01,048
Oh, it's mine?
What did I put in it?

2022
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:03,181
$800,000 in cash.

2023
01:38:04,825 --> 01:38:06,816
And what was it
you wanted to say?

2024
01:38:06,861 --> 01:38:08,795
Good yuntiff.

2025
01:38:12,466 --> 01:38:13,433
Officer.

2026
01:38:14,602 --> 01:38:16,194
I'm supposed to give
my deposition.

2027
01:38:16,237 --> 01:38:18,467
The judge will be
with you in a minute.

2028
01:38:23,077 --> 01:38:24,704
I'm going to have
to go to jail.

2029
01:38:24,745 --> 01:38:26,212
I'll knit you a sweater.

2030
01:38:26,247 --> 01:38:28,306
I might be in there
a long time.

2031
01:38:28,349 --> 01:38:30,214
I'll knit you
a jump suit.

2032
01:38:30,251 --> 01:38:31,878
Well, okay.
Okay, then.

2033
01:38:33,788 --> 01:38:35,983
I've come to
give myself up.

2034
01:38:36,524 --> 01:38:37,855
Hi, Annie.

2035
01:38:37,892 --> 01:38:39,291
Hi, Judge.

2036
01:38:40,962 --> 01:38:42,054
Good to see you, girl.

2037
01:38:42,096 --> 01:38:43,461
I've come to
give myself up.

2038
01:38:44,532 --> 01:38:47,865
You're going to have to
give yourself up to someone else.

2039
01:38:47,902 --> 01:38:50,837
I'm going to
get in some golf.

2040
01:38:53,808 --> 01:38:57,505
Why don't you
give yourself up to her?

2041
01:38:57,545 --> 01:38:59,706
That's what I'd do
if I were you.

2042
01:39:06,220 --> 01:39:09,212
I have learned a lesson
and the lesson is this:

2043
01:39:09,257 --> 01:39:11,623
That everybody needs
a second chance.

2044
01:39:13,494 --> 01:39:16,657
You, me and these
fine film people here.

2045
01:39:17,732 --> 01:39:20,530
You know, they have
a high profile

2046
01:39:20,568 --> 01:39:23,765
but that doesn't mean they
aren't deserving of our trust

2047
01:39:23,804 --> 01:39:25,567
and of our respect.

2048
01:39:25,606 --> 01:39:28,404
I think there's
a lesson here.

2049
01:39:28,442 --> 01:39:30,342
The lesson is this:

2050
01:39:30,378 --> 01:39:32,778
It is a lesson
of tolerance.

2051
01:39:32,813 --> 01:39:35,304
And as we look
at this industry--

2052
01:39:35,349 --> 01:39:36,543
Ssh...

2053
01:39:36,584 --> 01:39:40,418
As we look at this clean,
American industry,

2054
01:39:40,454 --> 01:39:43,890
and as I begin
my campaign for congress

2055
01:39:43,924 --> 01:39:47,155
in my aspiration toward
that city on a hill,

2056
01:39:47,194 --> 01:39:49,560
I would
like to say this...

2057
01:39:52,566 --> 01:39:55,831
This is picture?
This is picture?

2058
01:39:58,105 --> 01:39:59,902
- Roll camera.
- Speed.

2059
01:39:59,940 --> 01:40:02,135
“The Fires of Home,”
scene one, take one.

2060
01:40:05,012 --> 01:40:06,309
Action?

2061
01:40:08,783 --> 01:40:10,774
Hold still now.

2062
01:40:13,854 --> 01:40:16,914
I guess that fire got a little
bit exciting last night, eh, Frank?

2063
01:40:18,459 --> 01:40:20,893
Doc, that's their nature.

2064
01:40:20,928 --> 01:40:22,088
If you didn't have
a little excitement

2065
01:40:22,129 --> 01:40:23,153
wouldn't life be dull?

2066
01:40:23,197 --> 01:40:25,631
That it would.

2067
01:40:25,666 --> 01:40:27,827
What do I owe you?

2068
01:40:27,868 --> 01:40:30,063
You quit your kidding.

2069
01:40:30,104 --> 01:40:32,664
Hey, Nate, see what
you can do with this.

2070
01:40:32,707 --> 01:40:36,040
Ha ha, fix it up
good as new, Frank.

2071
01:40:36,077 --> 01:40:37,339
Morning, Sister.

2072
01:40:45,252 --> 01:40:47,152
We missed you
in church today.

2073
01:40:47,188 --> 01:40:49,554
Sister, I've just
come from a fire.

2074
01:40:49,590 --> 01:40:52,855
That is an explanation,
but it's no excuse.

2075
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:01,300
Let me help you with that.

2076
01:41:03,604 --> 01:41:06,505
Sister, I didn't come here
to talk about the altitude.

2077
01:41:06,540 --> 01:41:08,474
What did you want
to tell me about?

2078
01:41:08,509 --> 01:41:11,103
Let's talk about something
a man could get his hands on.

2079
01:41:11,145 --> 01:41:13,511
That's exactly why
I want to talk to you.

2080
01:41:13,547 --> 01:41:15,447
I wish you had been
in church today.

2081
01:41:15,483 --> 01:41:17,041
What would I have seen?

2082
01:41:17,084 --> 01:41:19,609
You would have seen
Father Mulcahy,

2083
01:41:19,653 --> 01:41:22,281
that kind, dear old man.

2084
01:41:22,323 --> 01:41:23,517
I heard he was ill.

2085
01:41:23,557 --> 01:41:25,718
He is ill, and you
would have seen him

2086
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:28,194
rise from his bed
and hobble to church

2087
01:41:28,229 --> 01:41:30,595
and talk about
redemption.

2088
01:41:30,631 --> 01:41:34,067
If he had been
talking to me...

2089
01:41:34,101 --> 01:41:36,592
Just as bad. I have
no chance of redemption.

2090
01:41:36,637 --> 01:41:39,697
Redemption is not offered
once, Frank, but continually.

2091
01:41:39,740 --> 01:41:41,002
Kind words, Sister.

2092
01:41:41,041 --> 01:41:43,066
They are not mine.

2093
01:41:43,110 --> 01:41:44,634
And you come by
next Sunday,

2094
01:41:44,678 --> 01:41:46,407
we'll give you
a second chance.

2095
01:41:46,447 --> 01:41:48,210
Sister, the only
second chance I know

2096
01:41:48,249 --> 01:41:50,717
is the chance to make
the same mistake twice.

2097
01:41:53,554 --> 01:41:55,044
Cut!
That's a cut.

2098
01:41:55,089 --> 01:41:56,351
Bob, this is great!

2099
01:42:00,428 --> 01:42:02,419
We've got to talk
about this thing.

2100
01:42:02,463 --> 01:42:03,953
Joe. Joe?

2101
01:42:03,998 --> 01:42:05,727
I want to change this.

2102
01:42:06,767 --> 01:42:10,567
We are going again.
We are going again?

2103
01:42:11,605 --> 01:42:12,572
Good work, Bob.

2104
01:42:12,606 --> 01:42:14,335
Stand by.

2105
01:42:14,375 --> 01:42:16,002
Cue the dead horse.

2106
01:42:16,043 --> 01:42:18,443
And can we get a crate
of doughnuts for the teamsters?

2107
01:42:18,479 --> 01:42:19,969
Well, it beats working.

2108
01:44:14,795 --> 01:44:17,696
Man #1 : Would you care
to identify that song for us?

2109
01:44:17,731 --> 01:44:19,323
Man #2: The song is called--

2110
01:44:19,366 --> 01:44:21,800
well, the original title,
which we can't use any more

2111
01:44:21,835 --> 01:44:24,201
is called
“The Song of the Old Mill.”

2112
01:44:24,238 --> 01:44:26,468
We can't use that title
because that's no longer

2113
01:44:26,507 --> 01:44:27,371
the name of the movie.

2114
01:44:27,408 --> 01:44:29,137
Man #1 : The movie
now is called--

2115
01:44:29,176 --> 01:44:30,973
Man #2: The movie is now
called “The Fires of Home.”

2116
01:44:31,011 --> 01:44:33,809
Man #1 : “The Fires of Home,”
and this movie is about...?

2117
01:44:33,847 --> 01:44:38,409
Man #2: Well, it's about
many, many things.

2118
01:44:38,452 --> 01:44:42,479
Which I think is a character
of any great movie.

2119
01:44:42,523 --> 01:44:45,253
It means many different
things to many people.

2120
01:44:45,292 --> 01:44:46,850
Or three things
to three guys.

2121
01:44:46,894 --> 01:44:48,259
Man #1 : Let's go
the phones.

2122
01:44:48,295 --> 01:44:51,560
Maurice is on the line
from Medicine Hat, Alberta.

2123
01:45:31,805 --> 01:45:34,239
Man: Once more, and can you
try to play the notes this time?
