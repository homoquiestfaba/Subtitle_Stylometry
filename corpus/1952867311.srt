1
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,405
BEASTLY

2
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,105
And the next candidate
for Buckston High School

3
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,810
Green Committee President,
Kyle Kingson.

4
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,123
True or false...

5
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:39,131
you are an aggressively
unattractive person.

6
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:42,828
Hatchet face, face-ache,
face like burnt lego?

7
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:47,037
Or did you only
just miss the beauty boat.

8
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:51,434
Any which way,
best embrace the suck.

9
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,344
Beautiful people get it better.

10
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,344
That's just the way it is.

11
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:09,462
So-So...what does this got to do

12
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,327
with running for
Green Committee President?

13
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:14,799
Not much. Except...

14
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:18,496
you'll never elect me 'cause of
my commitment to the environment.

15
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:22,500
I don't have one.
I want this for my transcript.

16
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,409
But what you got to ask yourselves is,

17
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:28,208
should you vote for me just
because I'm the rich, popular,

18
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,715
goodlooking guy with the famous dad?

19
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:35,017
And the answer is, hell yeah.

20
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:01,177
Palm of your hand, man,
palm of your hand.

21
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,374
Stellar Angels in America essay.

22
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:06,475
I appreciate all the extra time
you spent with me, Mr. Bernstein.

23
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,079
You hate that teacher's guts.

24
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:10,384
Whatever it takes,
'til the college recs are in.

25
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:11,889
Speech killed.

26
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,791
Speaking of killing, you see that
ball-biting, voodoo-tatted slut.

27
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,988
But really, who gives?
Stick to my mantra

28
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,291
steer clear of the witch.

29
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,389
I'll put it out of your head later.

30
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,596
What the shit?

31
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,008
Maybe it's just me,

32
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,814
but shouldn't whoever runs
the Green Committee

33
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,514
actually care about things green?

34
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:47,626
Or be green, like the rest of
your facially disabled coven?

35
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,127
Throw it to someone deserving.

36
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,027
Lindy Taylor's only going for Treasurer

37
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,826
because she knew she couldn't win
President against you.

38
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:53,729
No, no, no. I...

39
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,826
But I think we're all hoping that
in the privacy of the voting booth

40
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,066
your bandwagoneers will stop
fearing for their social lives

41
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,868
and make the right choice.

42
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,173
And might I just add,

43
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:07,870
looks are important to you.

44
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,681
They're important to everyone.

45
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,376
Except you, clearly.

46
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:20,387
Appreciate the smear campaign
and kudos to you and

47
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,894
your bitchcrafty friend
for staging a little coup,

48
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,395
but if you wanted Prez,
you shoulda had...

49
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,091
Actually, I don't want Prez,

50
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,690
I don't know Kendra and
I don't let others speak for me.

51
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:32,295
But maybe that's just me being
the defensive scholarship kid. So,

52
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,600
best of luck tomorrow.

53
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,906
And it's nice to finally meet you
after three years.

54
00:04:58,598 --> 00:04:59,530
How are you?

55
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:01,865
Not bad.

56
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,265
Elections today.

57
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,572
Great.

58
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,071
No, not you. I was talking to my son.

59
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,578
- Did us proud.
- Yeah, all right.

60
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,981
Experimented with heroin too.

61
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:19,883
Terrific. Uh, wait, hold on. Jill,
I got to go.

62
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:23,086
Hey, I'm sorry, Jill got canned.

63
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,086
Yeah, it's probably the way
the baby ten looked on camera.

64
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,091
and she's a big-boned girl
to begin with.

65
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,396
People like people who look good.

66
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:34,092
Anyone who says otherwise
is dumb or ugly.

67
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,296
- Who's Jill?
- I told you about her.

68
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,395
I don't think so.

69
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,004
And I know this because
the last time we had a conversation

70
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,305
that lasted more than five minutes
was sophomore year.

71
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,902
I hear you.
Why don't you leave me alone?

72
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,413
When I told you I had brain cancer.

73
00:05:56,589 --> 00:06:00,650
And? Oh, shoot. Hang on.

74
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:01,659
Rob Kingson.

75
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,168
What?

76
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,563
Nothing. I say good night.

77
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,268
Why, 'cause you need to get home
to your sixteen children?

78
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,574
My three children live in Jamaica
with their father, which you know.

79
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:22,978
Do me a favor.

80
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:24,877
Save the sob stories

81
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,283
for your heart-to-hearts with Mr. Clean.

82
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,387
You no vex me,

83
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,087
you stoosh ginnygog.

84
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:36,494
And next year's GC president
Kyle Kingson.

85
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,698
Josh Black, please report
to the principal's office.

86
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,912
Don't think it was a landslide,
if it makes you feel better.

87
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:57,915
And... and I'm sorry.

88
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,417
Is bullshit one word or two?

89
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,952
No, it's not...
And I want to make it up to you.

90
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,648
I get two Green Party VIP passes.

91
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:07,250
Scores you greenroom access,
that kinda thing. want one?

92
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,553
- What's the catch?
- No catch.

93
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,657
- So I'd be like, going with you?
- Yeah.

94
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,367
What about your girl friend?

95
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:19,068
Deep-fried barbie doll
e-dumped me last night.

96
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,663
Hey, I don't know
what game this is, but I'll play.

97
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:22,366
Really?

98
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,876
Everyone deserves a second chance.

99
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,277
Besides, you know what
they say about me, don't you?

100
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,081
Vicious gossip.

101
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:33,175
And only idiots screw with witches.

102
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:35,279
Careful now.

103
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,001
Tell me you did not
get a cheap-ass rose.

104
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,294
Them no have the orchid.

105
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,395
They didn't have it?

106
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,202
I told you two weeks ago
to order it.

107
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,003
You tell me yesterday,

108
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,201
But listen.

109
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:05,645
"A symbol of humility,
the white rose also say,

110
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:08,346
'I am loyal and worthy of you.'"

111
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,052
WTF?

112
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,261
And it also means
I am loyal and worthy of you.

113
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,959
- Go blow a goat.
- I'm sorry.

114
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,466
The orchid was
this year's yellow ribbon.

115
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:23,968
It was a political statement.

116
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,766
Thanks for making me
look like an insensitive bitch.

117
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,776
I mean does it suck so bad?

118
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:36,376
No, it's... badass.

119
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,378
Did I ever congratulate you
on treasurer?

120
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:46,289
Probably never apologized for
my aholian election behavior either.

121
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,088
Well... two weeks ago
was the first and last time

122
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,286
you spoke to me in three years.

123
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,795
So, um... no.

124
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,097
Sorry on all counts.

125
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,491
Got to slave here all night?

126
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:56,796
Slaving all year.

127
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:57,801
Work-study?

128
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,338
Yeah. I'm saving
for the Machu Picchu trip.

129
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,634
But my shift's almost over.

130
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,232
Just in time for the real fun.

131
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,641
Yeah, right.

132
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,838
She blows it off. Too cool for school?

133
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,545
Definitely not. Just...

134
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,048
Not your thing.

135
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:14,352
That, and... well, that.

136
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,853
What can I say?
I'm substance over style.

137
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,255
A dying breed.

138
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,758
Never too late to join.

139
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,760
Think I already drank the kool-aid.

140
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,255
Always hope.

141
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,763
- Take a picture with me.
- What?

142
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,964
School newspaper.

143
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,467
But I'll need to approve it
before it runs.

144
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,077
Hold up.

145
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,876
- What else'll I do with it?
- "I'm worthy of you."

146
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:44,581
What?

147
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,177
What white roses mean.

148
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,779
Lamecore, I know.

149
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:53,689
And obviously not what I,
uh, thought you meant.

150
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,484
No, it's just...

151
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,026
See you later.

152
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,431
Don't be a stranger.

153
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,632
- What's with her?
- Pity mack.

154
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:42,335
Cause you got a flesh-eater
at 4 o'clock.

155
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:46,337
And here we go.

156
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,746
You actually bought it.

157
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,547
You bought that I'd hook up with you

158
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:58,352
the self-mutilated, tatted Frankenskank

159
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:02,087
who publicly humiliated me,
almost cost me the election?

160
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,685
No dice, sunshine.

161
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:07,389
But hey, you can buy a ticket.

162
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,397
Or here's a secret.

163
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:13,495
Sometimes they let you
in just 'cause you're eyecandy.

164
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:15,601
She eye-candy?

165
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,909
Rules are she needs a ticket.

166
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:21,608
Ah well, que sera, sera.

167
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:25,310
Spanish for sucks to be an ugly cow.

168
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,610
I only came to give you a second chance.

169
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,817
- Guess I blew it.
- I Guess so.

170
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,822
But Kyle?

171
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,720
Best embrace the suck.

172
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:16,293
Relax. Kyle,
I already forgave you. Come on.

173
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,697
God, you're sweating like a pig.

174
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,400
You see the way she looked at me?

175
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,410
So what?

176
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,303
- I got to go.
- Kyle.

177
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:10,988
How are you feeling, Kyle?

178
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,189
Kendra? what're you doing here?

179
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:19,698
I'm here for everyone
who just missed the beauty boat.

180
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,198
What?

181
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,402
And all the self-mutilating,
tatted Frankenskanks.

182
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,596
It was Ajoke.

183
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:27,798
I didn't get it.

184
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,802
But pretty soon, you will.

185
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,905
You have a year to find
someone to love you.

186
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,707
Before the tree blooms again.

187
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,919
When the spring flowers bloom again,
the year is up,

188
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,817
And either the words "I love you"
will release you from the spell

189
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,828
or stay like this forever.

190
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:51,828
Like what?

191
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,233
No!

192
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,468
No!

193
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:05,675
No!

194
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:12,183
As aggressively unattractive outside
as you are inside.

195
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,183
Wait!

196
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:18,087
You have a year
to find someone to love you.

197
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:23,285
or stay like this forever.

198
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,019
Dad.

199
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,417
Jesus, you scared me.

200
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,014
Don't turn on the light.

201
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,022
- Why?
- Please.

202
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,429
What's going on?

203
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,256
Why do you love me?

204
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,457
Kind of a question is that?

205
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:05,059
- Just answer it.
- Because you're my son.

206
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,969
But-But do you believe in magic?

207
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,668
Magic? what the hell are you--

208
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:17,280
Kyle?

209
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:22,079
His vision and hearing.

210
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:23,986
That's all you've got?

211
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:28,993
And, of course, his insides are just
as normal as-as they were before,

212
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,586
but the skin won't change
no matter what we do.

213
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,189
Now, what about skin grafts
or face transplants?

214
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,292
I mean, look at him, look at him.

215
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,697
He doesn't want to live life
looking like this.

216
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,104
We'd risk anything.

217
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:43,506
What?

218
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,110
Kyle, we are going to
find somebody else.

219
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:50,910
I'm not taking
"no" from Dr. Crap-For-Brains.

220
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,109
We will fix this.

221
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,516
Yes, because we'd risk anything,
including me dying.

222
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,816
No-No, that's not what I meant.
It just came out that way.

223
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,414
Or did it come out
because that is what you meant?

224
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:01,858
No.

225
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,660
Come on. I have a surprise for you.

226
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:17,570
What do you think, Kyle?

227
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,871
It's private, safe.

228
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:23,176
People can't be spying all the time.

229
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:26,375
Plus, I'm thinking I might get you
that motorcycle you've always wanted.

230
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,482
Where's your room?

231
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:33,986
It's right across the hall.

232
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,387
Don't worry. I will take care of
whatever you need.

233
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,697
Still need to get my stuff.

234
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,201
But we're keeping the place in the city?

235
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,800
So I can crash there late nights
if need be.

236
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,014
Dad?

237
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,048
Yeah?

238
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,457
Hey, hey.

239
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:20,769
Okay, I have a four-o'clock call,
so I will check in right after that.

240
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,673
And Zola's right here. Okay?

241
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:27,070
Who're you?

242
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,263
Mary Poppins.

243
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:36,476
The tutor. Uh, your dad hired me.
I'm supposed to move in today.

244
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,775
Tell my father
he can carpe diem in hell.

245
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,085
Happy to.

246
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,384
Meantime, how about you cage the rage

247
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:47,584
and invite me in
for a nice, hot bowl of Dad sucks?

248
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,292
Saw right through that one, Oprah?

249
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:51,886
Yeah, it's a little gift I have.

250
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,797
Especially since I can't actually see.

251
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,041
- Hi, I am will.
- Come in.

252
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,648
I'll get Zola.
She'll welcome you to hell,

253
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:15,050
fix you up with your own bedroom,
and explain what happened to me and-

254
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,051
and what I did to deserve this.

255
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:21,852
Oh, and please-please, hang with us.

256
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:24,555
Gouge the old man
for everything he's worth.

257
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,158
He deserves it.

258
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:28,763
You know what? Obviously, he forgot

259
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,564
to spin the borderline hostile act
of hiring a blind guy

260
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,264
to tutor his creepshow son.

261
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,364
As for learning calculus,
I think I'll take a pass.

262
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,476
Nice to meet you.

263
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,280
Sorry, I come back later.

264
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,102
How old are your kids?

265
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:11,909
Sixteen, thirteen, ten.

266
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,622
You just left them?

267
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,125
Can't get them green cards.

268
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,924
But you left them.

269
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,734
Parents do what
they do with what they know.

270
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:43,631
They were not very big when I leave.

271
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,836
It was five years.

272
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,641
For my little one, it is half his life.

273
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,849
There is a hole in my heart.

274
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,393
So I know your father will come.

275
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:05,687
I don't think so.

276
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:25,811
Rob Kingson. Leave a message.

277
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:27,811
It's me.

278
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,620
Could you do me a favor?

279
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:38,925
I, uh, I know we were
rescheduling for the next week,

280
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:43,934
or maybe it was the week after, but...

281
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:49,039
Maybe we should...

282
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:52,634
Maybe we should
just not pretend anymore.

283
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:24,792
Sweet.

284
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,112
Kendra!

285
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:39,611
Kendra!

286
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:41,709
Kendra! Kendra!

287
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,618
I am begging you.

288
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,114
Please make it end. Please.

289
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:47,818
I can't do that.

290
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:48,825
But-But I get it.

291
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,226
I--I know what it's
like to be shit-ugly.

292
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:55,430
So-So you got me, five months is enough,

293
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,831
I learned the lesson.

294
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:58,833
You learned nothing.

295
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:02,364
Find someone
who can see better than you can.

296
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:07,871
Seven more months
for someone to say, "I love you."

297
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,981
Please! Make this go away!

298
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:21,791
Sloan?

299
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:28,089
That sounded like Kyle, didn't it?

300
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:32,296
Weird. I suck not writing him back.

301
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,894
I suck more.

302
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:38,500
Well, but honestly,
with him gone, it's kind of a relief.

303
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,704
Like, I always felt like I had to be on

304
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:46,115
and mean, like really mean...
to keep him entertained.

305
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:49,313
And I know what you mean.

306
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,318
Hey.

307
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:54,415
Sorry.

308
00:24:55,193 --> 00:25:00,256
And I'm sorry to spy on you, spying.

309
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,359
Unbelievable.

310
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,772
But it does sorta feel like
the death of romance unfolding

311
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,172
before your very eyes, doesn't it?

312
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:12,874
Doesn't she have a boyfriend?

313
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:16,277
Yes, this is what I'm saying.

314
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:20,077
What happened to romance?

315
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:24,081
Sappy, soppy longhand love letters

316
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:31,190
and you really, really don't have
to keep listening to me, by the way.

317
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:34,589
Thing is that guy
they were talking about?

318
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,497
They're way off.

319
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:40,804
Personally I respect that
he called things as he saw them,

320
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,707
even if he did see them wrong.

321
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:46,100
Do you know what it really was?

322
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:47,109
What?

323
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,609
He was a shot of life.

324
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:37,787
You're kidding, right?

325
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:48,099
How do you do that?

326
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:53,207
I went to this dance and
some emo chick gave me a dart hex.

327
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,302
Bite me.

328
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:59,107
Oh hey, now you're up,
want to learn something?

329
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:03,453
- No!
- Be careful.

330
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:06,948
Lose your smarts, blondes
will be telling jokes about you.

331
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:18,061
My dad always said that
how much people like you

332
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:21,865
is directly proportional to
what you look like.

333
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,876
But they hated me.

334
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:36,880
High school unquestionably sucks ass.

335
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:40,788
You went to regular school?

336
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:43,589
At fifteen,
my friends lost their virginity.

337
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:45,190
I lost my sight.

338
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,391
But living hell has its upside.

339
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:51,895
- Like better hearing?
- Yeah.

340
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,404
And chicks dig blind guys.

341
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:00,842
Too bad they don't dig ugly guys.

342
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:03,546
How do you know?

343
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:22,319
Defying expectations,

344
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:25,413
Blindie keeps up
his bitchin' sense of style.

345
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,822
A holdover from my seeing days.

346
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:33,924
Point being, no matter what,
how you look matters?

347
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:38,230
Point being, it's not about
how others look at me,

348
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:41,030
it's about how I look at myself.

349
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:44,732
Mental Rubiks cube, I know,

350
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,039
but one day it'll make sense.

351
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:34,003
Ass-wipe.

352
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:36,012
You have the humor of a marmot.

353
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:41,718
So, I heard someone
sneaking in late last night.

354
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:42,718
Where'd you go?

355
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:47,019
Isn't the benefit of having
no parents that you have no parents?

356
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:48,217
Get off my back.

357
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:52,820
But, uh, you know, since we last talked,

358
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:54,330
I've been thinking and...

359
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:57,329
is there any kind of eye operation?

360
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:59,962
'Cause I saw, like,
every doctor in the country.

361
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:04,171
Miracles only, but thanks.

362
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,066
So where did you go last night?

363
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:09,977
I went to see about this girl.

364
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,983
I'm so happy for you!

365
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,882
I didn't even talk to her.

366
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:18,581
Baby steps. You think
you might say, "wassup?"

367
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:22,183
The benefit of you being blind
is you can't see

368
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,285
how I should so never say, "wassup."

369
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,591
Baby steps. we must celebrate.

370
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:34,597
One, two, three. wassup!

371
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:35,798
Fore!

372
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:40,501
One, two, three. wassup!

373
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,010
Wassup.

374
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,708
Wassup!

375
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,080
- Here's a sandwich, Ben.
- Thanks.

376
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,579
How's your dad? Stayin' out of trouble?

377
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:31,990
Dad, I'm home. Dad?

378
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,390
Come on.

379
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,994
Dad!

380
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,683
I don't have it.
Please, Victor, come on.

381
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:54,014
Just hook me up.

382
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:59,221
Just another week.
I just need a little more time.

383
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,850
No-No-No, I'm not screwing around,
you sorry-ass addict.

384
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:04,156
- Dad, not this again.
- I'm sorry, Lindy

385
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:06,355
Hey, shut up. And you get out of here.

386
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,557
Victor, please.
We'll get you your money.

387
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:12,061
Give me and my brother our money.

388
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:13,769
Dad!

389
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,672
No!

390
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:06,447
Where is she?

391
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:11,158
You killed him.

392
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,262
Your daughter for my brother.

393
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:17,958
Someday I'll find her.

394
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:19,568
I wouldn't.

395
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:22,667
What do you need?

396
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:25,768
Come on, what do you want?

397
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:30,973
I want her.

398
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:33,982
I'm want to protect her.

399
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:35,382
I can protect her.

400
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:40,388
Please. Did you hear him?

401
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,185
If she stays with me,
she-she'll be safe.

402
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:46,996
I don't know who you are.

403
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:50,192
But if she leaves... If she leaves...

404
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,302
cops will get these.

405
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,937
No. It's just too twisted.

406
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:02,936
So's killing a man.

407
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,646
But what's she gonna think of you?

408
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:27,361
Zola, remember.
Hunter, not Kyle. Hunter.

409
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,872
Hello, I'm Zola.

410
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:35,878
- Where is he?
- You can go.

411
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:37,678
I'm not gonna just leave you here.

412
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:38,680
With some stranger?

413
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,182
Son of an old friend. For your safety.

414
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:44,380
Bullshit and I can take care of myself.

415
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:46,582
- I let you say goodbye.
- No need.

416
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:48,982
How'm I gonna know you're okay?

417
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,391
You're not.

418
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:51,985
Deal is, I give up my life,

419
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,793
my whole life, school, friends,
everything, everything.

420
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:57,390
And in return, you don't come see me,

421
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,595
don't call me, don't do anything.

422
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:01,933
Just stay away.

423
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:06,736
I screwed up,
keep screwing up, I know that,

424
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:08,537
but I don't know what else to do...

425
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:09,738
You can leave.

426
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,663
So I'm here, okay?

427
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:33,067
Whoever you are.
You come near me, I taser your ass.

428
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:45,181
So that makes two of us.

429
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:53,688
43, 47, 53, 59...

430
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:57,194
- I got you food.
- Call someone who gives.

431
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,003
I'd really like to explain.

432
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:10,804
Please come out.

433
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:16,305
Inviting.

434
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:21,216
What?

435
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:31,311
This time go to Barneys,
get Manolos or whatever

436
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:33,913
sick-expensive kind Sloan
and her bimbots loved.

437
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:37,017
Everything you say to me about her,
everything I see,

438
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:38,527
tells me she's not the kind.

439
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:39,528
Prada, then.

440
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:40,529
To be bought.

441
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:42,422
I'm not trying to buy her.

442
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,229
You are. And she'll hate that.

443
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:47,636
So what, then?

444
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,939
What do you know about her?

445
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:52,537
You must think about her.

446
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:55,340
Me know you see who she is.

447
00:41:56,514 --> 00:42:00,075
Go on. Think.

448
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:10,283
It's like you don't even know me.

449
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:13,789
This whole thing is all kinds of mess.
It's just a bad scene.

450
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,298
There's nothing remotely good
and I miss everybody.

451
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,803
I miss being able to go out and
get deli coffee whenever I want.

452
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,802
And the clinic.

453
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,396
And everything that made me me.

454
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:24,998
No, it's way screwed up and

455
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:28,602
he thinks he can give me a few presents
and, like, that fixes everything.

456
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:32,115
I know it's just for a little while,
but I'm hating it.

457
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:37,614
I hate missing school, hate my dad,
just hate hating.

458
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:39,212
And I know it's life or death

459
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:42,919
but I've been saving for
that Machu Picchu trip for three years.

460
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:46,326
You know, the first thing
I did in my life just for me,

461
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,331
just because I wanted to.

462
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,433
Lindy-Lindy journeys to
a wonder of the world

463
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:54,733
and finally seizes her moment and--

464
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:00,073
Jesus, what's your problem?

465
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:01,270
What's with the mask?

466
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:02,573
I didn't want to freak you out.

467
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:05,581
Sure. The ski mask didn't freak me out.

468
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,476
I, uh, I-I got you Jujyfruits.

469
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,389
Can I ask you something?

470
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,392
Why am I here?

471
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:19,190
Because you need to be protected.

472
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,094
But I can take care of myself.

473
00:43:21,165 --> 00:43:22,496
You don't even know me.

474
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,597
But my Dad and-and-and your Dad--

475
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:27,000
I know, his mysterious
"friend from the past."

476
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:29,198
He wanted someone
they couldn't trace you to.

477
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:32,401
He's scared out of his mind
something will happen to you.

478
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,006
Because of how much he loves you.

479
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:39,010
which he kept saying over and over.

480
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:44,216
- Really?
- Yeah.

481
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,118
Thanks for the Jujyfruits.

482
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:50,817
You're welcome.

483
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:02,969
The thinking thing killed. Killed.

484
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:28,796
Dear Lindy, I've been
thinking about letters recently.

485
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:31,300
The real kind. Longhand.

486
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:34,303
And how it's terrible that
nobody's writing them anymore.

487
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,800
And so I decided to start
one to you, today.

488
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:41,706
Now, you're doing what?

489
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:44,009
Seeing if I can build a greenhouse.

490
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:45,912
She's very into roses.

491
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:47,807
Each color means
something different, you know?

492
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:51,116
Yeah. well, they all kind of mean,

493
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:55,625
I'm a guy who cries over chick flicks
and sleeps with stuffed animals.

494
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:01,162
I'm not here.

495
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,069
Hey. I'm Lindy.

496
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:15,373
Hi. will. A pleasure.

497
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:17,875
I, uh... heard the game.

498
00:45:17,948 --> 00:45:19,882
- You a Rangers fan?
- Die-hard.

499
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:22,384
I knew it. Guys' gal.

500
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:24,481
Guys' gal.

501
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:28,185
- Why don't you join me?
- Thanks.

502
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:29,190
Sure.

503
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:32,394
What's with all the tools?

504
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:35,591
Uh, it's Hunter's thing.
It's a structure on the roof.

505
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:36,997
Structure for what?

506
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:41,104
You ever see the 1954
Devil Girl from Mars flick,

507
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:44,800
Where they abduct virginal
teenage girls for breeding stock?

508
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:51,312
I'm just-- It's a joke-joke. Sorry.

509
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:54,509
I haven't gotten out much.
I'm losing my social graces.

510
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:55,643
Rewind.

511
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:00,854
Hi. will. Pleasure.

512
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,553
The building books belong to Hunter,

513
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:08,758
an all-around, way-good guy
who's contemplating building

514
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,457
a greenhouse.

515
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:15,071
- A greenhouse?
- Yeah.

516
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,063
Rad.

517
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:20,975
Right?

518
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:22,064
Very funny.

519
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:33,775
So are we gonna, like, really meet?

520
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:36,583
- Like, now?
- No.

521
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:38,086
Okay.

522
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:45,694
You lived here your whole life?

523
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:48,688
No. Pretty recently.

524
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:50,692
I was living with my dad,

525
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:54,897
but he's the kinda guy
who can't really deal...

526
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,705
I wouldn't know anything about that.

527
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:01,536
And your mom?

528
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:08,449
Mine's dead. I never knew her.

529
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:13,349
So...no mom...Screwed-up dad.

530
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:15,758
It's too bad we have nothing in common.

531
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:22,760
What's with the Korean TV?

532
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:25,867
You speak Korean?

533
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:29,571
- Fluently.
- Oh, really?

534
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,868
What are they saying?

535
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:34,167
"Bon Appetit."

536
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:36,678
She didn't say "Bon Appetit."

537
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,681
Oh, you speak Korean too?

538
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,774
I don't like to show off, but yes.

539
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:43,183
And Koreans do not say Bon Appetit.

540
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:45,185
She said the Korean equivalent.

541
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:46,187
Which is what?

542
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,190
I hope you have a big appetite

543
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:52,388
such that you scarf food
and hurl chunks.

544
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,196
No that's the subjunctive.

545
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,789
I'll take Mom, you take Perm Boy.

546
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:57,799
Game on.

547
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:01,636
So what's she saying now?

548
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:06,242
I love you, but when it comes to hair,
you are a clueless wonder

549
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:10,446
I can tell you for a fact
that is not what she said.

550
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:12,448
What Mom said was...

551
00:49:22,025 --> 00:49:24,050
Hope will isn't your Korean teacher.

552
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:28,561
Do you, uh...do you miss school?

553
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,464
Like a natural-born wonk.

554
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:35,469
Cause, uh...I have classes
if you want to come.

555
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:41,074
Yes. I'd love to

556
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:43,979
- Tomorrow?
- Sure.

557
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:48,779
Well, great.

558
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:50,786
I guess good night then.

559
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:53,187
Hold up.

560
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:15,709
Pretty gruesome, huh?

561
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:22,716
I've seen worse.

562
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:05,787
We're having school today,

563
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:07,887
but you need to make it
seem like we didn't just start

564
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:09,795
a-and I need to look smart.

565
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,000
Lindy's coming.

566
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:16,105
Shut up. what're we studying?

567
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:19,006
Don't worry, I'll come up with
something graphic and humiliating.

568
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,703
No-No-No.
I need to know what it is now.

569
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:22,301
I need the answers in advance.

570
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:23,812
That's called cheating.

571
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,711
No, that's called trying
to get a girl to like you

572
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:28,114
while look like the lead
in a slasher flick.

573
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:31,217
- Shakespeare sonnet?
- Obvious.

574
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:33,017
- E.E. Cummings.
- Cliche.

575
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,321
What's cliche is the guy liking
school to impress the girl.

576
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:39,423
What about the Frank O'Hara poem
"Having a Coke with You"?

577
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:41,423
How do you know that poem?

578
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:43,728
I Googled
"modern poetry, impress girls."

579
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,536
But I need smart things to say.

580
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:49,431
Good luck with that.

581
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:54,038
I need another thinking thing.
Another thing Lindy'll like.

582
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,339
It's for this morning. Please don't ask.

583
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:57,039
When my husband wanted me to marry him,

584
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,445
he would weave me baskets.

585
00:51:58,515 --> 00:52:00,881
Yeah, I really don't think
that's gonna work.

586
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:03,378
- What about chocolate?
- Oh, no.

587
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:04,385
Come on.

588
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:06,881
She will like it
when you are being kind.

589
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:09,491
Yeah, I suck at that

590
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:11,186
When you are being yourself.

591
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:13,286
What, this self or the jerk I was?

592
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:17,292
The man I know you to be.

593
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:03,276
How'd you do it?

594
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:06,675
I, uh, I just figured it out.

595
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:12,683
I love "Having a Coke with You."

596
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:14,489
- Shoot me now.
- What?

597
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:20,087
No, I mean, that's great,
that you know all about it

598
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:22,688
and will have
lots of smart things to say.

599
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:25,394
Blind man climbing.

600
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,803
- Could you just hang on a sec?
- Ow! Blind guy tripping.

601
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:33,006
- You're okay?
- Peachy.

602
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:34,202
Zola, thanks for getting these.

603
00:53:34,277 --> 00:53:35,904
And by the way, I'm up the creek.

604
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:38,504
It turns out "Having a Coke with You"
is one of Lindy's favorites.

605
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:40,516
God, I'm looking forward to this class.

606
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,410
- Here you go.
- How'd you know?

607
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:46,512
Deli coffee, very underrated.

608
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:48,318
As I've always said.

609
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,021
Long-time green thumb?

610
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:55,130
No, no.

611
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,162
Actually my dad stuck me in this house

612
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:01,568
so no one could see me.

613
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:04,573
And I thought I'd take the, the ugly and

614
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:06,973
shameful thing and
turn it into something not.

615
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:17,176
Of course, not everyone
can necessarily see its beauty...

616
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,188
Just read.

617
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:28,695
Having a Coke with You

618
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:32,100
is even more fun than
going to San Sebastian,

619
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:40,299
lrun, Hendaye, Biarritz, Bayonne

620
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:41,708
or being sick to my stomach

621
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:45,214
on the Travesera de Gracia in Barcelona

622
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:48,316
partly because in your orange shirt

623
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:51,718
you look like a better
happier St. Sebastian

624
00:54:52,188 --> 00:54:54,213
partly because of my love for you.

625
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:02,862
We be back.

626
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:05,867
We-- Oh, yeah, we be back. we be back.

627
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:06,867
Carry on.

628
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:19,881
in the warm New York 4 o'clock light

629
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:23,578
we are drifting back and forth
between each other

630
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:27,282
like a tree breathing
through its spectacles

631
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:40,693
and the portrait show
seems to have no faces in it at all,

632
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:42,698
just paint

633
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:46,100
you suddenly wonder
why in the world anyone ever did them

634
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:50,810
I look at you
and I would rather look at you than

635
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,814
all the portraits in the world

636
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:21,267
I need more time.

637
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:24,170
Magic can't be undone.

638
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:25,475
But I might have a shot
if I had more time.

639
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,175
Can't, sorry.

640
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,781
Okay. I pissed you off. You wasted me.

641
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:32,879
But there's got to be something
you can do.

642
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:34,184
Come on, help me.

643
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:35,986
I can't. And I wouldn't.

644
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,186
You still don't think about
anyone but yourself.

645
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:43,598
You're wrong.
I do think about other people.

646
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:45,395
I think about Lindy
and what her life is like

647
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:46,901
and I think about
a woman who can't see her kids

648
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,403
and a man who can't see, period.

649
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:52,500
So he cares now?

650
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:57,711
Yeah. Yeah.

651
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:00,842
Okay, I'll keep trying with Lindy.

652
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:05,047
But please give will his sight,
Zola her family.

653
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:07,046
It's the least they deserve

654
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:08,852
after being trapped
in this hell with me.

655
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:12,656
I'll help them. If you succeed.

656
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:20,961
And Kyle, good luck.

657
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:33,377
- I got your CDs.
- Thanks.

658
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:51,390
Just some guy at my old school.

659
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:53,793
- Kind of a jerk, actually.
- Really?

660
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,804
Yeah, we were
on this committee together,

661
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:57,897
so that's why I have his picture.

662
00:57:58,274 --> 00:58:01,539
I mean... Looks-wise, he doesn't suck.

663
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:03,238
Oh! He knew it, too.

664
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:05,442
Same old, same old:

665
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:07,142
jerks are exciting
and my type falls for 'em.

666
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:10,050
- Did you fall for him?
- Not that I fell for him.

667
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:15,156
Every once in a while,
you kind of remind me of him.

668
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:17,950
Not that you're a jerk.

669
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:24,566
Anyways, he disappeared. Rehab.

670
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:29,869
Oh, it figures. The addict's daughter
falls for the addict.

671
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:31,566
So you did fall for him?

672
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:35,668
No, I mean, I just talked to him
his last night.

673
00:58:35,745 --> 00:58:36,871
For, like, a minute.

674
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,576
You konow, the truly
ridiculous thing is,

675
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:41,276
I might have, kind of, sort of,

676
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:45,685
actually thought he,
a little bit, liked me...ish.

677
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:47,188
Of course he did.

678
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:48,189
Oh, please.

679
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:52,490
He was completely on the in
and I was not, am not.

680
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:53,790
That's why I like you.

681
00:58:57,066 --> 00:58:59,830
Yeah, well...same.

682
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:03,236
Anyways, being on the in isn't all that.

683
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:06,241
Isn't that what people on the out
say to make each other feel better?

684
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:10,545
Yeah. But it also happens to be true.

685
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:14,840
Something about him...

686
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:16,650
What?

687
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:21,047
Underneath all the bullshit was...
I don't know.

688
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:23,049
What?

689
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:25,359
Good.

690
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:27,053
Good?

691
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:32,660
So, I mean, are you still into him?

692
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:36,464
Like you said, you don't want to be
the girl who falls forjerks.

693
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:38,268
Yeah. But he-he's not.

694
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:40,571
Right. He's a decent guy at heart.

695
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:41,974
That's what I'm thinking.

696
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:44,775
But still kinda...wrong.

697
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:46,480
Yeah.

698
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,275
I don't know.

699
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:54,686
You know, that something underneath,
it's catnip for sappy tools like me.

700
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:58,088
To be the one who uncovers it.

701
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:08,997
Do you want to go somewhere with me?

702
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:23,611
Usually, if I'm out this time of night,

703
01:00:23,686 --> 01:00:25,210
I'm looking for my dad,

704
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:27,913
mace in hand, counting by primes.

705
01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:28,923
Counting?

706
01:00:28,992 --> 01:00:30,823
It keeps me from getting scared.

707
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:37,232
Oh. Fortunately,
scary guy's right next to you.

708
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:39,332
So there's that.

709
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,431
What about when people see you?

710
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:46,138
They don't. I got it down.

711
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:48,843
I was good at blending in too.

712
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:53,245
This way.

713
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,047
You taking me to the park?

714
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:59,884
You'll see. Come on.

715
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:03,883
The zoo?

716
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:08,696
Hear that?

717
01:01:09,966 --> 01:01:14,300
The animals. water lapping.

718
01:01:16,572 --> 01:01:19,200
In some nearby street,
a man is whispering...

719
01:01:20,476 --> 01:01:21,500
"I love you."

720
01:01:26,482 --> 01:01:27,414
Do you hear that?

721
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:31,617
What?

722
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:34,418
Somewhere there's a baboon
scratching his ass.

723
01:01:58,414 --> 01:01:59,346
Why are we here?

724
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:01,780
This place is important to me.

725
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:22,396
It's still here.

726
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:24,999
What is it?

727
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:28,002
When I was in kindergarten,

728
01:02:28,878 --> 01:02:31,312
my dad offered to take me
anywhere I wanted.

729
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:33,913
We came to the zoo.

730
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:38,313
He bought me
all the toys and candy I wanted.

731
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:42,414
And at the end of the day,
he told me my mother had left.

732
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:47,228
I haven't seen her since.

733
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:55,434
After he told me,
I ran away and hid in here.

734
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:57,236
And saw this movie.

735
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:06,479
It's about this mother elephant
whose two babies die.

736
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:08,880
Plague or something.

737
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,980
She misses them so much

738
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:17,787
that when she's migrating back
a year later--

739
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:25,489
a year later--
she finds her babies' bones.

740
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:32,302
Can you imagine that love?

741
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:36,110
No.

742
01:03:45,188 --> 01:03:47,622
I never brought anyone here before.

743
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:12,174
Seven, eight, nine...

744
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:19,183
ten, eleven, twelve...

745
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:23,983
It feels like I've known you forever.

746
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:34,000
Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen...

747
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:35,701
The sun's coming up.

748
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:49,011
I think...

749
01:04:52,288 --> 01:04:53,516
I think I love you.

750
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:57,909
Maybe I should let her go.

751
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:00,250
At least she'll be safe in Machu Picchu.

752
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:02,848
She has been jonesing
for that trip forever,

753
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:04,358
even without being stuck here.

754
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:07,453
But every day,
she like you more and more.

755
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:08,861
But not the way I like her.

756
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:11,557
- Move your hands. My turn.
- Sorry.

757
01:06:12,435 --> 01:06:13,868
I don't stand a chance.

758
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:17,064
She's still talking about
running away. And...

759
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:22,267
I-I know you guys want out, too.

760
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,169
- Desperately.
- No.

761
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:26,276
Kidding. Kidding.

762
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:28,283
Look, even if she does go on the trip,

763
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:31,479
you still have a couple days
to ratchet up the romance quotient.

764
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:34,489
Just try to put yourself in her shoes.

765
01:06:34,557 --> 01:06:36,684
This is all so strange for her,

766
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:39,990
but me know she'll say
those words, "I love you."

767
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:42,988
It's just the year is almost up.

768
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:47,895
Just take her to whatever
bad-boy country house Daddy's got.

769
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:49,198
Daddy don't got.

770
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:53,501
Just the lake cottage.

771
01:06:54,877 --> 01:06:57,505
Just the--

772
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:00,845
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Would you buy a frickin' vowel? Go!

773
01:08:18,727 --> 01:08:20,160
seriously?

774
01:08:23,532 --> 01:08:24,464
After you.

775
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:38,980
So, are you, uh, dying of boredom yet?

776
01:08:40,749 --> 01:08:41,681
No.

777
01:08:44,253 --> 01:08:47,780
It must have been so great
as a kid coming out here.

778
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:51,285
My dad got bad reception down
at the lake.

779
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,895
He could only take it
for about forty-five minutes.

780
01:08:56,065 --> 01:09:00,024
But those forty-five minutes...
they were awesome.

781
01:09:05,107 --> 01:09:09,635
My Dad was a teacher.
You know, before my mom died and

782
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:12,246
he lost it.

783
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:13,739
Do you miss your dad?

784
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:15,841
Not right now.

785
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:21,547
In the past few months,
living away from my dad...

786
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:26,061
not spending every second
worrying about him,

787
01:09:26,629 --> 01:09:29,154
I mean, not trying to
fix everything for him,

788
01:09:29,231 --> 01:09:32,564
Just not totally losing myself.

789
01:09:33,035 --> 01:09:36,266
That's why I wanted to go away
on that trip in the first place.

790
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:40,975
I guess this cage set me free.

791
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:44,774
Is that a "thank you"?

792
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:49,677
- Let's go down to the lake.
- Okay.

793
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:12,903
I've been writing something for you.

794
01:10:13,576 --> 01:10:15,908
- What is it?
- A letter.

795
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:38,626
I'm sorry. This-This ring is only--

796
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:40,433
Hello?

797
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:44,235
Which hospital?

798
01:10:44,306 --> 01:10:46,433
Okay. I'll--I'll--I'll call you back.

799
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:53,438
My father OD'd.

800
01:10:57,319 --> 01:10:58,547
You have to go to him.

801
01:11:11,467 --> 01:11:12,991
All aboard!

802
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:27,107
- Thank you.
- Go, go, go!

803
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:28,410
- I'll call you.
- He's gonna be fine.

804
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:30,918
Okay. I'll call you. And as soon as
he's better, I'll come back.

805
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:33,418
And everything will be all right.

806
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:35,714
And Hunter...

807
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:37,624
Yeah?

808
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:43,424
You're a good friend.

809
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:05,877
Don't. Don't read that.

810
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:10,082
Don't read that. Don't read that.

811
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:19,398
Dear Lindy, I've been
thinking about letters recently.

812
01:12:19,768 --> 01:12:22,202
The real kind. Longhand.

813
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:25,297
And how it's terrible that
nobody's writing them anymore.

814
01:12:25,574 --> 01:12:28,907
And so I decided to start
one to you, today.

815
01:12:28,977 --> 01:12:34,609
And I'm going to write to you
every day for a long, long, long time

816
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:41,313
because I think-
I think I might be in danger of...

817
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:43,221
falling in love with you.

818
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:57,335
Hey, it's me.
Uh, my dad is gonna be okay, but

819
01:12:57,706 --> 01:13:00,971
I really want to talk to you
about your letter.

820
01:13:01,443 --> 01:13:02,876
Where are you?

821
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:05,773
Look, I don't understand.

822
01:13:05,848 --> 01:13:07,281
You wrote me this letter.

823
01:13:07,349 --> 01:13:08,873
Why don't you call me back?

824
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:10,884
Because I'm "a good friend."

825
01:13:11,353 --> 01:13:12,980
What's going on?

826
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:16,324
Hunter...

827
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:35,507
I'm out of time.

828
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:36,407
Call her back.

829
01:13:36,478 --> 01:13:38,002
Why, because I'm "a good friend?"

830
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,012
Yup.

831
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:41,606
And not calling her back,
what good that do, huh?

832
01:13:42,284 --> 01:13:45,617
She even called me.
Why won't you talk to her?

833
01:13:45,687 --> 01:13:49,623
The last time I talked to her,
she told me she's hurt.

834
01:13:49,691 --> 01:13:53,627
And "hurt" is girl-speak for,
"Call now, bonehead."

835
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:56,325
She don't know what to do,

836
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:58,832
so she go back to school
to go on the trip.

837
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:41,307
Lindy!

838
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:50,609
What're you doing here?

839
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:52,613
I had to see you before you left.

840
01:14:52,688 --> 01:14:54,121
- You wrote me that letter.
- I know.

841
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:56,623
- And then you didn't call me back.
- I'm sorry.

842
01:14:56,692 --> 01:14:58,421
You knew what was going on with me.

843
01:14:58,494 --> 01:14:59,825
I was being dumb.

844
01:14:59,895 --> 01:15:01,954
- I just was scared you didn't--
- Didn't what?

845
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:03,156
Love me.

846
01:15:07,035 --> 01:15:10,664
And I didn't think you could.
Because of how ugly I am.

847
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:19,080
And I should have known better,
that that's not who you are.

848
01:15:22,951 --> 01:15:27,388
You took one look at me
and still said you'd seen worse.

849
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:34,491
Somehow...when I'm around you...

850
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:40,396
I don't feel ugly at all.

851
01:15:43,171 --> 01:15:44,900
It's because you're not.

852
01:16:30,152 --> 01:16:31,084
Go.

853
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:32,779
You deserve it.

854
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:45,992
Nothing's gonna change
while you're gone.

855
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:49,496
That I can promise.

856
01:17:03,218 --> 01:17:04,150
Go.

857
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:11,658
Go.

858
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:22,569
Hunter.

859
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:28,268
I love you.

860
01:18:03,412 --> 01:18:04,538
Kyle.

861
01:18:40,849 --> 01:18:41,781
Hunter!

862
01:18:43,351 --> 01:18:44,283
Kyle!

863
01:18:45,153 --> 01:18:47,678
Sorry, I'm looking for someone,
I don't mean to be rude.

864
01:18:47,756 --> 01:18:48,882
- I get it.
- Thanks.

865
01:18:48,957 --> 01:18:50,390
And sometime, you'll tell me
what happened to you.

866
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:52,188
- I-I met someone.
- That's great.

867
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:53,887
She reminds me of you.

868
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:56,190
And she showed me
that love can change you.

869
01:18:56,264 --> 01:18:57,390
Do you think love change you?

870
01:18:57,466 --> 01:18:58,398
Of course.

871
01:18:58,767 --> 01:19:00,029
Then you'll believe the story
I'm about to tell you.

872
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:01,034
Where is he?

873
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:05,130
It's about a guy, good-looking
on the outside, ugly on the inside.

874
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:08,040
And there's a curse.
Love-Love changes him.

875
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:09,543
Everyone knows that story.

876
01:19:11,012 --> 01:19:14,140
What if it wasn't a story?
What if it were true?

877
01:19:14,216 --> 01:19:15,148
What?

878
01:19:51,253 --> 01:19:54,689
Can you imagine...that love?

879
01:20:01,163 --> 01:20:02,095
Can you?

880
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:10,002
Yeah.

881
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:26,511
It's you.

882
01:20:56,318 --> 01:20:59,151
Wake up. Wake up.

883
01:21:00,956 --> 01:21:05,484
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

884
01:21:10,165 --> 01:21:12,190
It's a dream, right?

885
01:21:13,568 --> 01:21:14,899
It's must be.

886
01:21:17,472 --> 01:21:18,700
But happy.

887
01:21:20,075 --> 01:21:22,009
Very damn happy.

888
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:28,811
Mr. Kingson, your new intern
is coming up in the elevator,

889
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:30,408
I thought you might want to meet her.

890
01:21:30,485 --> 01:21:32,009
Just so long as she's easy on the eyes.

891
01:21:32,087 --> 01:21:34,317
Well she's a bit odd looking.

892
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:36,016
No dogfaces, no dumpy frumps.

893
01:21:36,091 --> 01:21:38,616
But her reference said
no matter what you throw her way,

894
01:21:38,693 --> 01:21:40,820
she can always work magic.

895
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:54,000
