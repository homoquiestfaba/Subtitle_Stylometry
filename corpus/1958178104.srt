INTERVIEWER:
So as you've been
coaching over the years,

2
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:08,609
what would you say are the
most important, uh, lessons

3
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:10,277
of leadership
that you've learned?

4
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:13,781
COACH K:
The very first thing is that,

5
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:15,349
you know,
in order to get better,

6
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:16,584
you change limits.

7
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:17,651
And when you change limits,

8
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,786
you're gonna look bad
and you're gonna fail.

9
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:22,690
And at West Point,

10
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:25,358
I learned that failure
was never a destination.

11
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,696
In other words,
when you are knocked back,

12
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:32,566
you know, figure out why
and then, then change.

13
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:36,237
The other thing is that you're
not gonna get there alone.

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,571
You know, be on a team.

15
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:40,541
You know, surround yourself
with good people

16
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:42,108
and learn how to listen.

17
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:46,246
You're not gonna learn
with you just talking.

18
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,650
And when you do talk,
converse,

19
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:51,184
don't make excuses.

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,788
Figure out the solution.

21
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,491
And you don't have to
figure it out yourself.

22
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:03,464
I always wanted to be
a part of a team

23
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:05,632
and obviously I wanted
to lead that team.

24
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,168
You know, what a,

25
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:09,569
what an interesting life

26
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,272
it is to be a leader.

27
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,542

to be here.

-Because I love this, Richie.

I love this so much, dude.

123
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:18,732
Did you know that
when this restaurant
opened 12 years ago,

124
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,302
it won the best restaurant
in the world the same year?

125
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,337
It's retained three stars

126
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,205
because we have
a waiting list that's long.

127
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,608
Five thousand people waiting
at any given moment long.

128
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:30,077
Do you see their faces
when they walk in here?

129
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,046
How stoked they are to see us

130
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:34,180
and how stoked we have to be
to serve them?

131
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:37,585
It takes 200 people
to keep this place in orbit.

132
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:39,520
And at any given moment,
one of those people

133
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:41,455
that is waiting in line
gets to eat here.

134
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,490
They get to spend their time
and their money here.

135
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,025
I'm sorry, bro,

136
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:47,561
but we need to have some forks
without streaks in them.

Every day here
is the freaking Super Bowl.

138

You don't have to drink
the Kool-Aid, Richie.

00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:57,605
I just need you to respect me.
I need you to respect the staff.

140
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,206
I need you
to respect the diners.

141
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,607
And I need you
to respect yourself.

142
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:08,515

159
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:44,518

their fuckin' minds.

MANAGER: Last thing,

165
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,329
still, no one is
owning up to the smudge.

166
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:57,598
I wanna clarify that it's not
so much the smudge,

167
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:59,066
but rather the fact that no one

168
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,769
is taking responsibility
for the smudge.

169
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:04,505
We're not children.
It's okay to make mistakes.

170
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:08,208
We can smudge things,
but we need to own up to them

171
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:11,578
with immediacy,
integrity, and honesty.

172
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,448
Does anyone wanna talk
any more about the smudge?

173
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,458
Couple menu updates.

174
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:26,427
Uh, per Chef Terry

175
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,462
the duck roulade
will now be served

176
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,197
with a, uh,
Concord grape reduction

177
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,432
instead of the cherry.

178
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,734
We're gonna be adding
a dish to the menu.

179
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,336
That's gonna be the six-course,

180
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:38,105
a Dungeness crab
with grapefruit and champagne.

181
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,073
-Did you talk about the smudge?
-Only a lot.

182
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,077
I know this sounds ridiculous.

183
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,312
I am aware that I've had to say
the word fucking "smudge"

184
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,214
20 times
in the last two days,

185
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:48,782
but we had to reset
the plate with the smudge

186
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,751
because the persimmon glaze
was smudged,

187
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:52,653
which fucked the set because
we had to take it to a four-top,

188
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:55,222
which meant we have to match
the other three plates

189
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,358
to the smudge plate,
which cost us 45 seconds.

190
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:59,293
-Forty-seven seconds.
-Forty-seven seconds.

191
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,328
Now, if you cost us
that kind of time,

192
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:03,297
you sure as shit
better own up to it,

193
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,199
because we sure as shit
are gonna pay for it.

194
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:06,634

195
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:07,601

Thank you.

398
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:37,338
Uh, but I couldn't
live with myself

399
00:20:37,371 --> 00:20:40,540
if I let this beautiful family
leave Chicago

400
00:20:40,941 --> 00:20:43,410
without sampling one
of my personal favorite dishes.

401
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:46,480
Pequod's deep dish.

402
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:47,648

You did not
hear me say that. (gasps)

404
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,620
Mangia, baby.

-You guys good on drinks?
-WOMAN: I can't believe this.

You guys want some
Bacardi and Diet?

410
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,232
Little B&D,

411

-(all laughing)
-Enjoy, guys.

412
00:21:09,236 --> 00:21:10,070
What a service.

413
00:21:10,104 --> 00:21:12,473
It's way better than New York.
Right?

414
00:21:12,506 --> 00:21:14,308
-WOMAN:
Don't you say that to my mom.
-MAN: Hey, hey.

415
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:15,643

Don't you say that to my mom.

416
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:17,177

00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:21,115
Go.

419
00:21:21,148 --> 00:21:22,449

Three seconds.

421
00:21:24,251 --> 00:21:25,519
Uh, apple cider gastrique.

422
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:26,754
Apple cider gastrique!

423
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:28,355

424
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:29,390
-Alright, let's go.
-(Garrett grunts)

00:21:29,423 --> 00:21:31,058

426
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:32,359
Oh, come on.
That's Bercy.

427
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:34,461
W-wait. Wait. No.

428
00:21:34,895 --> 00:21:36,129
Velouté derivative.

429
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,599
-That's an Allemande.
-Ooh, yeah, it sure is.

430
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:40,367
Oh! Oh! Hadouken!

431
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,069

432
00:21:42,102 --> 00:21:43,304
-2012.
-Yes.

433
00:21:43,337 --> 00:21:44,605
And what year
did we get our third star?

434
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:47,374
-2012. Trick question. Nice try.
-JESSICA: Correct.

435
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:50,477
And lastly, what were
tonight's specials?

436
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,478
We don't have specials.

437
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:52,613
We do however have supplements,

438
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:54,748
including tonight's
caviar pairing.

439
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:57,618

Yo, let me ask you,
am I the oldest stage

464
00:23:04,785 --> 00:23:06,253
that's ever staged here?

465
00:23:06,286 --> 00:23:07,754
GARRETT:
I don't know, dude. Probably.

466
00:23:08,355 --> 00:23:10,624
-How old are you?
-That's an HR violation.

467
00:23:10,657 --> 00:23:12,059
-You're not supposed to ask--
-Fuck off, Garrett.

468
00:23:12,092 --> 00:23:14,028
-How old are you?
-I'm 30, dude.

469
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:15,329
-Thirty.
-And you're like a chef?

470
00:23:15,362 --> 00:23:17,231
-What?
-RICHIE: You like to cook?

471
00:23:17,264 --> 00:23:19,300
-You like, uh, rattle
the pots and pans?
-GARRETT: No, I don't like--

472
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:20,568
No, no, I don't like to cook.

473
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:22,336
Then why you work
at a restaurant?

474
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:23,703
GARRETT:
I don't know, man, because...

475
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:26,439
A couple of years ago,
I had a drinking problem.

476
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,308
And I got sober.

477
00:23:28,842 --> 00:23:31,078
I'm good now, you know,
like I feel healthy

478
00:23:31,111 --> 00:23:32,479
and I'm happy and I'm grateful.

479
00:23:33,013 --> 00:23:34,481
And through that experience,

480
00:23:34,514 --> 00:23:37,317
I learned about
acts of service and...

481
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:43,057
I just like being able to serve
other people now.

482
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,057
You know?

483
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:47,328
-Service.
-GARRETT: Yeah.

484
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:49,597
You know, I used to work
for this guy who used to say

485
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,732
that taking care of people
at the highest level

486
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:53,567
was like working at a hospital.

487
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,236
You know,
like it was like medi--

488
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:57,204
Okay. That's a little much.

489
00:23:57,237 --> 00:23:58,739
I'm just saying,
I think that's why restaurants

490
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:01,608
and hospitals use
the same word, "hospitality."

491
00:24:03,343 --> 00:24:04,612
Yeah, no shit.

492
00:24:04,645 --> 00:24:06,012
Hospitality.

493
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:12,219
I wanted to say thanks
for a fun week, man.
It was dope.

494
00:24:12,252 --> 00:24:14,188
Thank you, my man.
It was fun.

495
00:24:14,221 --> 00:24:16,090
GARRETT:
Yeah. Um, you know,

496
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:17,458
we have a new stage
coming tomorrow morning,

497
00:24:17,491 --> 00:24:19,559
and, um, I think we're all
really gonna miss you here.

498
00:24:20,227 --> 00:24:21,595
Aah.

499
00:24:22,496 --> 00:24:23,597
Fuck, man.

500
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,632
I'm just gettin' the hang of it.

501
00:24:24,665 --> 00:24:26,299
GARRETT:
I know, I know. I know.

502
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:29,103
We have one more
shift tomorrow, but, yeah.

503
00:24:29,136 --> 00:24:30,170
Damn.

504
00:24:30,938 --> 00:24:33,039
Let me ask you,
like, what if, uh...

505
00:24:33,874 --> 00:24:35,743
I mean, I don't know
what the situation is like,

506
00:24:35,776 --> 00:24:37,043
you know, but...

507
00:24:37,844 --> 00:24:40,781
if something opens up,
you know...

508
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:42,449
Richie.

509
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:44,284
That'd be awesome,
but you know it's not my call.

510
00:24:46,386 --> 00:24:47,521
Alright.

511
00:24:47,554 --> 00:24:51,058
I mean,
I got another job anyway.

512
00:24:51,091 --> 00:24:54,027
I am needed elsewhere.

513
00:24:55,062 --> 00:24:56,162
Thanks, bro.

514
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:07,440
(sighs)

515
00:25:09,476 --> 00:25:11,579
(exhales)

516
00:25:11,612 --> 00:25:13,547
(cell phone ringing)

517
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:18,319
-Yo, cousin, what's up?
-What's going on?

518
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:19,553
CARMY:
I'm watching Fak
do something--

519
00:25:19,587 --> 00:25:21,221
-FAK: I'm recalibrating.
-I'm watching Fak recalibrate.

520
00:25:21,254 --> 00:25:22,489
Yeah, I'm recalibrating.

521
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:25,326
We, uh, we failed
the fire suppression test.

522
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:26,727
Another one, dude?

523
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,162
CARMY:
Yeah, yeah, another one.

524
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:29,229
We have one more shot.

525
00:25:29,263 --> 00:25:31,031
RICHIE: How bad is it
if we fail that one?

526
00:25:31,064 --> 00:25:32,065
It's fuckin' bad--

527
00:25:32,432 --> 00:25:33,667
-(screams) Goddammit.
-Shit! Fuck, man!

528
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,070
-FAK: Okay, I'm just--
-CARMY: Please be careful.

529
00:25:36,103 --> 00:25:37,338
It's bad, cousin.
What do you need?

530
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:38,339
RICHIE: What do I need?

531
00:25:38,372 --> 00:25:40,440
(scoffs)
I don't need anything.

532
00:25:41,108 --> 00:25:43,377
-Just calling
to tell you I'm done.
-CARMY: Yes, yes.

533
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,244
No, that's right.
How'd that go?

534
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:45,713
Bro, you're going
to fuck yourself.

535
00:25:45,746 --> 00:25:46,714
RICHIE: It was fine.

536
00:25:46,747 --> 00:25:47,614
(Fak groans)

537
00:25:49,249 --> 00:25:51,118
Yo, I know you sent me there
to get rid of me.

538
00:25:51,151 --> 00:25:52,720
What... To get rid of you?
Fak. Fak. Fak!

539
00:25:52,753 --> 00:25:54,655
-I fucking told you.
-RICHIE: Yes.

540
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,823
-Please!
-Yes.

541
00:25:55,856 --> 00:25:58,291
I was annoying you and you
wanted me out of your hair.

542
00:25:58,658 --> 00:26:00,027
-(Fak screams)
-What?

543
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,228
-RICHIE: Yeah, you sent me--
-No, no.

544
00:26:01,261 --> 00:26:02,295
-RICHIE: No, cousin--
-No. No, no, no.

545
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:03,330
-I-I-I sent you there--
-RICHIE: No, cousin.

546
00:26:03,363 --> 00:26:04,732
You sent me there

547
00:26:04,765 --> 00:26:07,167
to fucking humiliate me,
you fucking jagoff.

548
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,069
Make me look like
a fucking jagoff.

549
00:26:09,102 --> 00:26:10,070
You're the fucking jagoff,
Carmen.

550
00:26:10,103 --> 00:26:12,039
What the fuck you talkin' about?

551
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:13,607
-(screaming) Fuck! Fuck!
-Yo! Fuckin' Christ!

552
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,175
-Fak! Jesus!
-Stop! Stop it!

553
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:16,376
-CARMY: Just fuckin' stop.
-FAK: Stop!

554
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:17,310
-Yeah, I'll talk to you later.
-CARMY: Take a break.

555
00:26:17,344 --> 00:26:18,712
FAK: I actually think
I hurt myself.

556
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:30,790
(alarm beeping)

557
00:26:35,796 --> 00:26:37,430
(water running)

558
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,541
Um...

559
00:27:09,763 --> 00:27:12,499
(clock ticking)

560
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:15,468
(footsteps approaching)

561
00:27:16,002 --> 00:27:18,072
Hey, I'm about
to go over staff reviews.

562
00:27:18,105 --> 00:27:19,807
-You wanna observe?
-Oh, uh, thanks.

563
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,175
I gotta finish this last bin.

564
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,044
'Kay.

565
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,514
We loved having you here.
Thanks for everything.

566
00:27:28,682 --> 00:27:29,716
Thanks, Chef Jess.

567
00:27:36,223 --> 00:27:37,190
(sighs deeply)

568
00:28:01,548 --> 00:28:04,551
You know where the polish is?
That bullshit keeps moving.

569
00:28:04,584 --> 00:28:05,752
Try that drawer over there.

570
00:28:08,388 --> 00:28:09,757
What are you making?

571
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,392
I'm just peeling mushrooms
for the lamb des tournelles.

572
00:28:14,294 --> 00:28:15,629
Peeling mushrooms?

573
00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:18,098
Yeah. It's just
a nice little fun detail.

574
00:28:18,131 --> 00:28:20,067
So when the diners see it,
they know that someone

575
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,368
spent a lot of time
on their dish.

576
00:28:21,401 --> 00:28:22,669
Do you wanna have a go?

577
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,604
Alright.

578
00:28:25,005 --> 00:28:27,107
Okay, so hold it like this.

579
00:28:27,474 --> 00:28:29,743
-Mm-hmm.
-Knife, 1300.

580
00:28:30,844 --> 00:28:34,414
Grab the end
and just peel like that.

581
00:28:35,515 --> 00:28:36,650
So slowly.

582
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:41,421
Yeah.

583
00:28:44,157 --> 00:28:45,659
Thirteen hundred, huh?

584
00:28:45,692 --> 00:28:47,194
-TERRY: Yeah.
-Did you serve?

585
00:28:47,962 --> 00:28:50,297
-Dad did.
-RICHIE: Yeah. Same.

586
00:28:50,664 --> 00:28:52,333
Staff sergeant.

587
00:28:52,366 --> 00:28:53,700
Corporal.

588
00:28:54,468 --> 00:28:55,336
A lot of standards.

589
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:56,670
Yeah.

590
00:28:56,703 --> 00:28:58,272
Turns out, I like standards.

591
00:28:58,305 --> 00:28:59,372
(Richie scoffs)

592
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:02,209
(Richie sighs)

593
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,110
Did you move around a lot?

594
00:29:04,578 --> 00:29:06,279
Yeah. You?

595
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:11,518
-I know Carmen.
-RICHIE: Yeah, I know.

596
00:29:14,288 --> 00:29:15,723
I'm sorry
that he pulled a favor.

597
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:17,991
Not at all.
I don't do favors.

598
00:29:24,464 --> 00:29:26,466
-How's that?
-That's great.

599
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:30,303
-Can I do another one?
-TERRY: Yes, please do.

600
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,145
So why do you do this?

601
00:29:38,178 --> 00:29:40,180
(laughs) I do it for a living.

602
00:29:40,213 --> 00:29:43,684
No, but, like, don't you
have stages that do this shit?

603
00:29:43,717 --> 00:29:45,685
Yeah, well, I like
starting the day with this.

604
00:29:46,052 --> 00:29:49,156
-Why?
-TERRY: Respect. Feels attached.

605
00:29:49,189 --> 00:29:51,425
I think time spent doing this
is time well spent.

606
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:53,326
RICHIE: Time well spent.

607
00:29:54,628 --> 00:29:56,297
That's what it's all about?

608
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,164
Yeah, I think so.

609
00:30:01,168 --> 00:30:02,302
When did that start?

610
00:30:03,103 --> 00:30:07,374
Oh, I st... I tried to open
a giant place years ago.

611
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:12,613
I had all these accolades.
I was younger, I was on fire.

612
00:30:12,646 --> 00:30:14,447
I was arrogant, and, uh...

613
00:30:15,749 --> 00:30:17,117
I tried to move too fast.

614
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,319
I couldn't keep the place open,

615
00:30:18,352 --> 00:30:20,787
and the market crashed
and I got killed.

616
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:24,191
Public wipeout?

617
00:30:24,224 --> 00:30:26,259
Oh, yeah.
The most public wipeout.

618
00:30:30,264 --> 00:30:31,732
So how'd this place happen?

619
00:30:31,765 --> 00:30:33,400
Well, now, that was on my...

620
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:36,303
-My 38th birthday.
-Hmm.

621
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:40,507
I was out walking all night,
unemployed, angry, depressed.

622
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:44,778
Blaming everybody else
for all the time I'd lost

623
00:30:44,811 --> 00:30:47,314
and the money I'd lost,
all of it.

624
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:49,116
And it was raining.

625
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:52,186
And I was walking
through Lincoln Park.
My phone had died.

626
00:30:52,219 --> 00:30:55,256
And so I stood under this awning
waiting for the rain to stop.

627
00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:57,057
And I just stood there
and stared.

628
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:58,192
And eventually the sun came up

629
00:30:58,225 --> 00:31:00,126
and it turns out
I was right there.

630
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:03,063
And then I walked
'round to the front

631
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:05,733
and I saw the sign.

632
00:31:05,766 --> 00:31:07,301
It was an actual sign.

633
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:09,169
It was a restaurant
for lease sign.

634
00:31:10,704 --> 00:31:12,506
Like, um... (clicks tongue)

635
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,308
-...never too late kinda thing.
-TERRY: Yeah.

636
00:31:14,341 --> 00:31:16,243
Never too late to start over.

637
00:31:22,282 --> 00:31:24,618
How did you get
the money to open?

638
00:31:24,651 --> 00:31:26,687
Um, well, my dad had died
the summer before,

639
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,057
and only child, my mum sold
the house and put it in here.

640
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,458
-Oh. Family business.
-TERRY: Yeah.

641
00:31:32,693 --> 00:31:34,028
You close with your ma?

642
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:36,764
Yeah, she's my best friend.
You?

643
00:31:36,797 --> 00:31:39,667
My best friend's ma
was like my ma.

644
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,767
TERRY: Ooh, yeah?

645
00:31:42,703 --> 00:31:44,137
What about your dad?

646
00:31:44,638 --> 00:31:45,739
-No.
-Yeah. (laughs)

647
00:31:45,772 --> 00:31:47,173
Are you close to yours?

648
00:31:48,308 --> 00:31:49,810
-Hmm.
-Yeah. Yeah, it's funny.

649
00:31:49,843 --> 00:31:53,346
I learned the most about him
when I was packing up his house.

650
00:31:54,147 --> 00:31:56,683
All his belongings,
like, his whole life.

651
00:31:57,618 --> 00:32:00,287
And I found this
stash of pocket notebooks

652
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,222
that he must have taken with him
when he was on tour.

653
00:32:03,156 --> 00:32:04,692
And full of all these details,

654
00:32:04,725 --> 00:32:08,195
like the palm trees he'd seen
or escargot he'd tried.

655
00:32:08,228 --> 00:32:10,330
Or this time
the ocean looked purple.

656
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:13,167
And, um, the way
he wrote everything,

657
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:13,968
it was like a reminder,

658
00:32:14,001 --> 00:32:16,737
like a...
don't forget this moment

659
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:19,607
or don't forget this
interesting, strange detail.

660
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,775
Hundreds of these entries.

661
00:32:21,808 --> 00:32:22,943
JESSICA: Chef Terry?

662
00:32:22,976 --> 00:32:25,746
And he'd-he'd sign each one off
the same way every time.

663
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:28,048
-Chef?
-Yes, Chef?

664
00:32:28,081 --> 00:32:29,183
Arnaud upstairs.

665
00:32:29,216 --> 00:32:30,551
TERRY:
Oh, thank you, Chef.

666
00:32:30,584 --> 00:32:31,785
Don't be a stranger, Richie.

667
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,289
Say hi to Carmen for me.

668
00:32:35,322 --> 00:32:36,557
Yeah, will do.

669
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,024
TERRY: Thank you.

670
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:41,061
He believes in you,
you know.

671
00:32:41,094 --> 00:32:41,995
(Richie scoffs)

672
00:32:42,596 --> 00:32:44,131
What makes you say that?

673
00:32:44,164 --> 00:32:45,565
He told me.

674
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:48,501
He said you're good with people.
He's not wrong.

675
00:32:52,739 --> 00:32:53,741
Nice talking to you, Chef.

676
00:32:53,774 --> 00:32:55,275
TERRY: Likewise, Chef.

677
00:32:57,377 --> 00:32:59,213
Uh, ch... Chef?

678
00:32:59,246 --> 00:33:01,649
Uh, you never said
what he signed off with.

679
00:33:01,682 --> 00:33:03,617
What'd your dad...
