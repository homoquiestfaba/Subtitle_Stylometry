1
00:00:56,045 --> 00:00:58,598
"Girl, I love... " No.

2
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,452
"Girl, I love your... "

3
00:01:00,524 --> 00:01:02,215
No, that ain't it.

4
00:01:02,508 --> 00:01:04,419
"Girl, I love your style.

5
00:01:04,685 --> 00:01:06,921
"I love when you get that smile.

6
00:01:07,084 --> 00:01:10,117
"You should be in a magazine,
because you're a queen.

7
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,772
"Our love is everything. "

8
00:01:14,348 --> 00:01:16,901
- Percy?
- Not right now. I'm busy.

9
00:01:17,355 --> 00:01:19,244
You got a girl in there?

10
00:01:22,603 --> 00:01:25,058
What kind of question is that,
"You got a woman in here?"

11
00:01:25,131 --> 00:01:26,756
I didn't know. I heard you talking.

12
00:01:26,827 --> 00:01:28,802
- I'm in here doing my vows.
- Vows?

13
00:01:28,874 --> 00:01:32,452
For this ridiculous party
my wife is losing her mind over!

14
00:01:32,587 --> 00:01:37,027
This extravaganza is costing a lot of money.
Now she wants us to renew our vows.

15
00:01:37,322 --> 00:01:39,330
What was wrong with what I said
the first time?

16
00:01:39,403 --> 00:01:41,923
- What's wrong with "I do"? I did, didn't I?
- Yes, you did.

17
00:01:41,993 --> 00:01:45,473
- Women, boy.
- I know. Women, it's just a whole other...

18
00:01:48,938 --> 00:01:53,094
You know what? I think it's cool
you're just doing the lyrics from that song.

19
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:55,049
I wrote this on the way to work
this morning.

20
00:01:55,113 --> 00:01:56,870
- You wrote that on the way to work?
- Yeah.

21
00:01:56,937 --> 00:02:00,515
Were you listening to the radio
when you wrote it? 'Cause I think it's B2K.

22
00:02:00,584 --> 00:02:03,968
Okay, then. If this is to a song,
tell me what the next line is.

23
00:02:05,257 --> 00:02:06,979
Baby, turn around

24
00:02:07,112 --> 00:02:10,625
And let me see that sexy body
go bump, bump, bump

25
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,356
That's it.

26
00:02:14,664 --> 00:02:15,612
Go.

27
00:02:18,664 --> 00:02:19,777
Reggie.

28
00:02:20,936 --> 00:02:23,204
See your sexy smile and bump, bump?

29
00:02:23,367 --> 00:02:25,310
- Three bumps.
- Three bumps.

30
00:02:28,008 --> 00:02:30,625
See your sexy smile and you bump, bump

31
00:02:31,303 --> 00:02:33,725
See your sexy smile and you

32
00:02:40,423 --> 00:02:44,415
Hey, boss. Did I hear Theresa's bringing
a new boyfriend to your anniversary party?

33
00:02:44,486 --> 00:02:45,500
Yes.

34
00:02:46,437 --> 00:02:48,380
What? I'm fine with it.

35
00:02:48,582 --> 00:02:51,779
- So, you met him?
- Nope. I pulled his credit report.

36
00:02:52,102 --> 00:02:54,687
- You didn't.
- I sure as hell did.

37
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,985
Fred, this young brother is a stockbroker
for J.P. Oliver.

38
00:02:59,172 --> 00:03:02,403
- Theresa? I don't believe it.
- Marilyn said she's crazy about him.

39
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,876
And this boy's credit report, I'm telling you,
is a thing of beauty.

40
00:03:06,948 --> 00:03:08,377
I almost cried.

41
00:03:08,452 --> 00:03:11,102
Wow, this guy sounds too good to be true.

42
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:14,335
He probably is. But the brother has a job.

43
00:03:14,404 --> 00:03:17,437
- I'm glad you think that way...
- That's right, my friend. A J-O-B!

44
00:03:17,507 --> 00:03:18,937
...but I quit.

45
00:03:20,611 --> 00:03:23,328
- I quit!
- Simon, calm down.

46
00:03:23,747 --> 00:03:26,846
I'm just trying to explain to you
how the world works.

47
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,857
It's the clients, I'm just explaining...

48
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:32,095
None of my clients seem to care.
This guy didn't seem to care, did he?

49
00:03:32,163 --> 00:03:33,886
Come on. Don't be so sensitive.

50
00:03:33,953 --> 00:03:37,053
That's not how the world works.
It's how your world works.

51
00:03:37,572 --> 00:03:39,993
Simon, sit down. Simon!

52
00:03:50,722 --> 00:03:51,737
Jerk.

53
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:54,558
I don't need you, Nathan!

54
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,381
I don't need J.P. Oliver.

55
00:03:56,896 --> 00:04:00,790
My résumé is good enough. I can get a job
anywhere I want. I'm out of here.

56
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:11,637
I'm not going to freak out!

57
00:04:13,024 --> 00:04:14,485
What am I going to tell Theresa?

58
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:16,022
What am I going to tell her?

59
00:04:16,095 --> 00:04:20,765
"Baby, you know how you're always
saying I'm at the office too much?

60
00:04:20,832 --> 00:04:21,944
"Well, great news!"

61
00:04:22,015 --> 00:04:25,693
I'll meet my future father-in-law and
tell him I'm unemployed. That'll be great.

62
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,476
Okay. I'll get the next one.

63
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,233
I can't quit my job!

64
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,915
I'm not gonna beg for this job!

65
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:36,700
- I got $20 says he goes up again.
- I'll take some of that.

66
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:39,003
Oh, my God! I just quit my job!

67
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,494
I don't need this job! No.

68
00:04:52,285 --> 00:04:53,714
Here he comes.

69
00:04:57,596 --> 00:05:00,150
- Hi.
- Have a good one.

70
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:04,051
Hello, Liz. Simon Green here.

71
00:05:04,893 --> 00:05:06,202
Simon! What's up?

72
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:08,722
Every investment I've made
in the last six months.

73
00:05:09,532 --> 00:05:13,394
Listen. That job you offered me.
Tell me it's still open.

74
00:05:13,468 --> 00:05:14,678
Why? What happened?

75
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:17,465
I'll tell you about it later.
Can you talk to Bartlett for me?

76
00:05:17,532 --> 00:05:19,768
Are you kidding?
I'm e-mailing him right now.

77
00:05:19,836 --> 00:05:21,559
When he finds out you asked about this...

78
00:05:23,163 --> 00:05:24,145
he will go nuts!

79
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:25,878
Liz, thank you.

80
00:06:09,304 --> 00:06:11,126
Theresa? Baby?

81
00:06:13,592 --> 00:06:15,185
You're home early.

82
00:06:15,704 --> 00:06:17,395
Really early. Hi.

83
00:06:17,463 --> 00:06:20,529
- Got out of there quick.
- Good. Then come on, help me with these.

84
00:06:21,334 --> 00:06:22,676
What have we got?

85
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:25,166
Tumi.

86
00:06:25,815 --> 00:06:29,458
- That's nice. When did we get this?
- Got them today.

87
00:06:30,743 --> 00:06:34,157
Combined incomes. Bling bling, baby!

88
00:06:34,262 --> 00:06:35,922
Yeah. Bling bling.

89
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:41,517
Baby?

90
00:06:41,782 --> 00:06:44,270
God. You should have heard Dad's voice
on the phone...

91
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:46,676
when I told him you work for J.P. Oliver.

92
00:06:46,743 --> 00:06:49,776
I feel like he's more in love with you
than I am.

93
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,596
- Really?
- Yeah. You don't understand.

94
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:55,948
Ever since I can remember,
his whole thing has been about:

95
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,191
"Theresa, does that boy have a job?"

96
00:07:00,534 --> 00:07:03,250
- It's a good thing I do then, huh?
- I know.

97
00:07:04,787 --> 00:07:07,886
I'm so excited! Aren't you excited?

98
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:13,265
Theresa, a man is never excited
about meeting his future father-in-law.

99
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:18,856
You know, I was thinking.
Maybe we should postpone telling them.

100
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,746
What?

101
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:22,859
- It was your idea.
- I know.

102
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:26,122
But I'm thinking now
that maybe it was a bad idea.

103
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:27,983
No, I think it's a great idea.

104
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,418
Announcing our engagement
at my parents' party...

105
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:33,352
is gonna be the best present
we can give them.

106
00:07:33,427 --> 00:07:35,250
Babe, Mom's gonna flip.

107
00:07:35,603 --> 00:07:39,246
See, I'm not worried about your mom.
I was thinking about...

108
00:07:40,691 --> 00:07:41,900
him.

109
00:07:43,537 --> 00:07:47,400
See, he's about ready
to pop a blood vessel...

110
00:07:47,826 --> 00:07:50,761
in his head, because you guys
are losing a basketball game.

111
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:54,129
No, we were winning that game. Yeah.

112
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:02,348
We're bringing in a canopy here.

113
00:08:02,417 --> 00:08:05,352
Swags of tulle with festoons.

114
00:08:05,425 --> 00:08:07,148
Sprays of roses.

115
00:08:07,473 --> 00:08:09,708
Parquet dance floor here.

116
00:08:09,775 --> 00:08:12,361
Guests will be seated at tables
in Chiavari chairs.

117
00:08:12,432 --> 00:08:14,373
Very clean, very simple, very elegant.

118
00:08:14,448 --> 00:08:17,514
And rose petals on the lawn.
And not just a few...

119
00:08:17,903 --> 00:08:18,918
oodles.

120
00:08:18,992 --> 00:08:22,374
At my wedding, we had oodles of petals.
It was fabulous.

121
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:25,063
At that wedding, was a woman involved?

122
00:08:25,678 --> 00:08:27,205
Of course it involved a woman.

123
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,727
If she's not a woman, it's gonna be
a surprise to both of us. Hello!

124
00:08:30,798 --> 00:08:34,093
- Look.
- I'll tell you, this is going to be some party.

125
00:08:34,288 --> 00:08:36,425
Twenty-five years of marriage.

126
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:39,654
- More power to you, pal.
- Thank you.

127
00:08:40,046 --> 00:08:42,053
- Hey, baby.
- Sorry I'm late.

128
00:08:42,445 --> 00:08:44,550
My vice principal called in sick today...

129
00:08:44,621 --> 00:08:47,556
so it was just me
against 208 middle-schoolers.

130
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:50,760
I swear half of them
ate pure sugar for breakfast.

131
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:52,840
Hi, Dante.

132
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:56,203
- So, Percy, which one do you like best?
- I like that...

133
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,926
Is your name Percy?

134
00:08:58,605 --> 00:08:59,588
Which one costs the most?

135
00:08:59,662 --> 00:09:01,636
- They cost the same.
- They don't cost the same.

136
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:03,716
This one's from Saks.
This one's from Macy's.

137
00:09:03,788 --> 00:09:04,836
Saks!

138
00:09:05,676 --> 00:09:08,643
Thank you.
And now I can give my honest opinion.

139
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,121
- I'm digging that one, baby.
- Really?

140
00:09:14,636 --> 00:09:17,386
Well, that's too bad,
'cause I'm wearing this one.

141
00:09:17,453 --> 00:09:18,761
Hallelujah.

142
00:09:20,684 --> 00:09:21,961
Sweetheart.

143
00:09:22,123 --> 00:09:23,553
- Yeah?
- Listen.

144
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:26,121
Why do you even bother asking me?

145
00:09:26,187 --> 00:09:29,003
'Cause it's a big day for us
and I wanted you to feel included.

146
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:31,685
Why couldn't you include
Martha Superfreak out there?

147
00:09:31,756 --> 00:09:33,347
Dante is a nice man.

148
00:09:33,835 --> 00:09:35,144
A nice man.

149
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,276
A nice man that part of the time
likes to sleep with other nice men.

150
00:09:38,346 --> 00:09:39,491
Will you stop it?

151
00:09:39,562 --> 00:09:42,726
Would you open your mind, Percy Jones?
Dante is a metrosexual.

152
00:09:42,793 --> 00:09:44,769
- A what?
- He's a straight man with taste.

153
00:09:44,842 --> 00:09:48,137
No such thing. You might as well tell me
he rode over here on a unicorn.

154
00:09:48,202 --> 00:09:51,397
Look, serious face, serious moment.

155
00:09:51,849 --> 00:09:52,962
I need to talk to you.

156
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:55,880
I know, baby. I'm working on my vows.
Almost got them perfect.

157
00:09:55,944 --> 00:09:58,761
- That's sweet, but that's not it.
- What is it?

158
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,210
This boy that Theresa's bringing home?

159
00:10:02,632 --> 00:10:05,217
I don't know who his people are,
where he's from...

160
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:07,524
I don't know anything about him.

161
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:10,527
But what I do know is that
I need you to be nice.

162
00:10:11,048 --> 00:10:12,325
I'm always nice.

163
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:15,174
Let's be nice long enough
to find out who the boy is.

164
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,150
I already know who he is.

165
00:10:17,672 --> 00:10:19,711
- You pulled his credit report?
- I did not.

166
00:10:19,783 --> 00:10:22,205
You pulled his credit report, Percy?

167
00:10:23,944 --> 00:10:25,799
I mean, I glanced at it.

168
00:10:25,863 --> 00:10:28,678
But a credit report don't tell you
the character of a man.

169
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:31,132
But being a loan officer for 22 years...

170
00:10:31,334 --> 00:10:33,223
I can size that boy up in an instant.

171
00:10:33,288 --> 00:10:35,841
And you know I got a knack for it.
You know that.

172
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:38,015
Five seconds. That's all I need.

173
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:41,213
That's all I need.

174
00:10:42,596 --> 00:10:45,413
- Nobody knows that better than me.
- Say what?

175
00:10:45,863 --> 00:10:47,237
I didn't stutter.

176
00:10:55,844 --> 00:10:58,083
I'm not so good with dads, baby.

177
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,992
I'm good with moms. I'm better with moms.

178
00:11:01,126 --> 00:11:03,133
He's a big guy, right?

179
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:05,407
Scary big. He also has these...

180
00:11:05,476 --> 00:11:07,842
piercing eyes that just burn
right into your soul.

181
00:11:07,907 --> 00:11:12,282
Don't maintain eye contact for
a long period of time. At least today, okay?

182
00:11:13,476 --> 00:11:17,054
Babe, I'm kidding.
Just relax. It's gonna be fun.

183
00:11:17,892 --> 00:11:18,972
Okay?

184
00:11:20,739 --> 00:11:23,423
- Did you tell them?
- What? Tell them what?

185
00:11:23,874 --> 00:11:26,721
- Babe, don't... The...
- What?

186
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:29,242
- Did you... I'm...
- Cute? Clean-shaven? What?

187
00:11:29,315 --> 00:11:31,769
Pigment-challenged?
Did you tell them that I'm white?

188
00:11:31,843 --> 00:11:33,250
You're white?

189
00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:34,876
You're white?

190
00:11:35,235 --> 00:11:36,379
Stop the car!

191
00:11:37,891 --> 00:11:40,126
Oh, my God! Look at what you...

192
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:44,575
Oh, my God.

193
00:11:44,803 --> 00:11:46,264
Simon, I'm so sorry.

194
00:11:46,562 --> 00:11:50,238
- It was a joke, sir. I was kidding.
- Yeah, sister. You're funny.

195
00:11:51,008 --> 00:11:52,700
Simon, are you okay?

196
00:11:53,632 --> 00:11:55,771
- Who are you?
- Are you serious?

197
00:11:56,192 --> 00:11:57,820
Why am I in Jersey?

198
00:12:03,232 --> 00:12:05,949
- Don't worry. It's gonna be great, okay?
- All right.

199
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,667
I'm very sorry. It was a bad joke.

200
00:12:09,088 --> 00:12:13,311
- So, did you tell them?
- No. I only told them the important things.

201
00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:17,470
That I love you.
That you're an amazing man.

202
00:12:17,823 --> 00:12:20,955
That you have a very cute birthmark
on your left butt cheek.

203
00:12:21,088 --> 00:12:25,593
You just didn't feel the need to mention
it's a Caucasian butt cheek. That was...

204
00:12:26,526 --> 00:12:30,683
Simon, look. I didn't mention it
because I don't think it's gonna matter.

205
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:33,337
It's gonna matter.

206
00:12:34,143 --> 00:12:35,670
We're fine, sir.

207
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:00,212
Dad!

208
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:03,889
Look at this here. Oh, my God.
Give your daddy a hug.

209
00:13:06,108 --> 00:13:07,318
How are you?

210
00:13:07,516 --> 00:13:08,531
Mom!

211
00:13:10,013 --> 00:13:13,690
- Hey, my man. Percy Jones, baby.
- Pleasure to meet you.

212
00:13:13,756 --> 00:13:18,163
Man, look at this here. I like this, man.
Nice, solid, strong grip.

213
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,626
Wow. That's something else.

214
00:13:20,764 --> 00:13:24,112
Listen. You doing everything you can
to make my daughter happy?

215
00:13:24,219 --> 00:13:26,455
- No, Dad, it's...
- Hey, sweetheart.

216
00:13:26,523 --> 00:13:28,378
You can take that to the front door for me.

217
00:13:28,443 --> 00:13:29,872
- Thank you.
- No, you see, this...

218
00:13:29,947 --> 00:13:32,947
Don't interrupt.
I'm giving your friend a once-over here.

219
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:36,847
Sir? Don't stand like a statue.
Take it to the front door.

220
00:13:36,923 --> 00:13:39,856
That's that square with the hole.
Look inside, you see furniture.

221
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:41,205
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

222
00:13:41,274 --> 00:13:43,642
You doing everything in your power
to make her happy?

223
00:13:43,707 --> 00:13:46,902
I'm not sure if I am,
but I'd sure like a crack at it.

224
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,230
- Boy, I ought to drill you, man. I like him.
- Okay, all right, listen.

225
00:13:50,714 --> 00:13:53,201
Young man, don't worry about it. Relax.

226
00:13:53,272 --> 00:13:56,273
I figure, what, $30?
Get yourself some candy or something.

227
00:13:56,344 --> 00:13:57,970
Dad, this is Simon.

228
00:14:00,153 --> 00:14:01,233
Simon?

229
00:14:02,585 --> 00:14:05,366
- That's her boyfriend's name.
- That's right.

230
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:08,623
- Well, who are you?
- Wesley Thompson. That's my cab.

231
00:14:08,696 --> 00:14:11,992
But if you're still down with me
making your girl happy...

232
00:14:12,058 --> 00:14:13,485
I'm good to go.

233
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,340
- Why don't you just go?
- Just...

234
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:28,375
I wish Theresa would have told me
you guys were black.

235
00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:31,057
That would have saved an awkward moment.

236
00:14:31,992 --> 00:14:34,741
- Kind of like this one.
- Yeah.

237
00:14:37,398 --> 00:14:39,732
- Welcome home, sweetheart.
- Thanks, Mom.

238
00:14:39,797 --> 00:14:41,553
- Baby, let me get that.
- I got it.

239
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:43,569
Lemonade.

240
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,957
Damn!

241
00:14:52,661 --> 00:14:56,721
Ain't no need, us standing out here.
Why don't we go on inside and talk?

242
00:14:56,789 --> 00:15:00,619
Come on, we going on inside
with a quickness. No use standing out here.

243
00:15:00,694 --> 00:15:02,122
Just come on.

244
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,499
That boy's white.

245
00:15:03,925 --> 00:15:05,266
Nothing gets past you.

246
00:15:05,715 --> 00:15:08,650
I guess it's those 22 years as a loan officer.

247
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:11,475
- You knew about this.
- I didn't know a thing, I promise you.

248
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:14,574
But I did figure it out
after the second "Daddy!"

249
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:17,873
Why she just didn't say nothing?
Give us a warning, you know?

250
00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:20,939
We taught our girls
to see only people, not color.

251
00:15:21,012 --> 00:15:23,728
- I know that but...
- So, what's the problem?

252
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,018
I guess the problem is
she just didn't tell us.

253
00:15:27,091 --> 00:15:30,090
I'm expecting Denzel Washington
to come walking through the door...

254
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,919
and I get Whitey McWhiteman instead.

255
00:15:31,987 --> 00:15:34,256
- Hi, you guys.
- Hi!

256
00:15:34,739 --> 00:15:36,778
I'm just showing Simon the house.

257
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,638
You've a very beautiful home, Mrs. Jones.

258
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:41,837
- Why, thank you. You can call me Marilyn.
- Will do.

259
00:15:41,906 --> 00:15:43,630
You, too, Mr. Jones.

260
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:46,185
Thank you. You can call me Mr. Jones.

261
00:15:48,785 --> 00:15:50,346
I'm just kidding.

262
00:15:51,696 --> 00:15:53,703
You got me. That was funny.

263
00:15:53,872 --> 00:15:56,176
I'm making lemonade.
You want to sit down?

264
00:15:56,241 --> 00:15:59,306
- Yes, thank you. Sit down, babe.
- Great.

265
00:15:59,665 --> 00:16:02,348
So, Simon, they tell me
you work at J.P. Oliver?

266
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,561
Yes, sir.

267
00:16:03,632 --> 00:16:07,593
- You like it there? You been there long?
- Well, it's a couple of years, I suppose.

268
00:16:07,664 --> 00:16:11,788
- You moving up?
- There's been some recent movement, yes.

269
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,409
- You a hard worker? You work hard?
- The hardest.

270
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,926
- J.P. Oliver has a huge IPO coming up...
- He doesn't want to hear about this.

271
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:20,139
But he's asking you about your work.

272
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:23,622
- I know, but you go into details...
- He likes to be modest. Shut up.

273
00:16:23,694 --> 00:16:27,656
Anyway, they made Simon their IPO...
Wait, what is it? Point man?

274
00:16:27,727 --> 00:16:30,149
And they're flying him
to San Francisco on Monday.

275
00:16:30,224 --> 00:16:32,459
I'm not going to see him for three days.

276
00:16:32,528 --> 00:16:34,915
- So, Simon, what do your parents do?
- Yeah.

277
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:37,444
- My mother is a realtor.
- Mom, let me help you with that.

278
00:16:37,517 --> 00:16:40,332
And she sells mini-blinds
and teaches dance.

279
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:43,053
Damn. How many jobs your mama got?

280
00:16:43,407 --> 00:16:46,570
She's a single parent.
She's always been a hard worker.

281
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,459
What happened to your father?

282
00:16:49,005 --> 00:16:52,899
He left when I was two
and I haven't seen much of him since.

283
00:16:53,324 --> 00:16:56,588
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- It happens.

284
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,208
You play any sports?

285
00:17:02,028 --> 00:17:04,678
I played some foosball in college.

286
00:17:06,476 --> 00:17:09,989
- That's the table with the soccer guys...
- I know what foosball is.

287
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,002
- Stupid joke.
- It's not a sport.

288
00:17:12,076 --> 00:17:13,799
Dad, stop badgering him.

289
00:17:13,868 --> 00:17:16,834
I'm not badgering him.
I'm just taking an interest.

290
00:17:16,908 --> 00:17:19,778
I don't understand why you don't
play sports? It don't make sense.

291
00:17:19,851 --> 00:17:22,981
A man who don't play sports
isn't a real man, as far as I'm concerned.

292
00:17:23,051 --> 00:17:25,385
- I used to run a little.
- What? Like track?

293
00:17:29,323 --> 00:17:31,942
I mean, you don't look like a sprinter.

294
00:17:32,012 --> 00:17:34,247
- What'd you run? Did you steeplechase?
- Dad!

295
00:17:34,314 --> 00:17:36,070
Come on, man. What was your race?

296
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,025
- Cars.
- Cars.

297
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:41,123
- NASCAR.
- NASCAR!

298
00:17:41,802 --> 00:17:43,363
That was the one.

299
00:17:44,298 --> 00:17:46,884
I had some hopes and some dreams and...

300
00:17:47,178 --> 00:17:50,855
it all ended on a hot August day
on a speedway in Charlotte.

301
00:17:51,466 --> 00:17:53,352
It was a crash. Just...

302
00:17:57,417 --> 00:17:59,141
They said I should've been killed.

303
00:17:59,209 --> 00:18:02,656
Actually, I got out without a scratch.
I figured that was a sign.

304
00:18:02,985 --> 00:18:04,129
NASCAR?

305
00:18:04,712 --> 00:18:06,371
Mostly I just worked in the pit.

306
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,342
I mean, I test drove
for one of the drivers some, but...

307
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,009
What was his name?

308
00:18:13,353 --> 00:18:14,758
Jay Gordon.

309
00:18:14,855 --> 00:18:16,798
You drove for Jeff Gordon?

310
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:20,541
We called him Jay or J.G.
It was like a pet name.

311
00:18:21,992 --> 00:18:23,715
A pit name, actually.

312
00:18:24,488 --> 00:18:25,435
NASCAR?

313
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,473
I believe I said I don't like to talk
about that time in my life.

314
00:18:29,544 --> 00:18:30,655
NASCAR?

315
00:18:31,655 --> 00:18:33,116
What was I supposed to do?

316
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:36,005
He was staring at me
with those piercing eyes.

317
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,597
- He was not.
- It was like...

318
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:41,980
filled with piercing disappointment
'cause I don't play sports?

319
00:18:42,184 --> 00:18:45,281
"A man who don't play sports
isn't really a man now, is he?"

320
00:18:45,383 --> 00:18:48,349
I had to give him something! He's big.

321
00:18:48,613 --> 00:18:51,515
He's like... You said he was big,
but he's big-big.

322
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:54,558
But why did you lie about NASCAR?
My father loves NASCAR.

323
00:18:54,631 --> 00:18:58,012
It's NASCAR, baby. That's, like,
the whitest sport on the planet.

324
00:18:58,084 --> 00:18:59,427
Not anymore, Simon.

325
00:18:59,493 --> 00:19:01,914
There's, like, NASCAR and hockey.

326
00:19:02,436 --> 00:19:04,378
Hockey. I should have went with hockey.

327
00:19:04,452 --> 00:19:08,477
Don't worry. He'll forget about it.
He's like this with everyone.

328
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:11,647
It always takes him some time
to warm up to new people. That's all.

329
00:19:11,716 --> 00:19:15,806
- What are we talking about here?
- By Sunday, you'll be a part of this family.

330
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:18,561
I can tell he really likes you.

331
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,436
I don't like him.

332
00:19:23,171 --> 00:19:26,466
And I really don't think
the whole racial thing matters to him.

333
00:19:27,012 --> 00:19:29,564
- It's not that he's white.
- It's not?

334
00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:44,184
- Is this yours or mine?
- That's mine and that's for later.

335
00:19:44,257 --> 00:19:46,624
No. I think it's for now.

336
00:19:47,585 --> 00:19:50,814
- If memory serves me right, I think it's mine.
- No, Simon.

337
00:19:53,219 --> 00:19:54,559
Take it off!

338
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:57,342
- Take it off right now.
- It's perfect on me.

339
00:19:57,409 --> 00:19:59,830
- What are you doing?
- Look at it. Red is my color.

340
00:19:59,905 --> 00:20:03,220
- Always has been. Look at it. My goodness!
- Simon, take it off.

341
00:20:03,296 --> 00:20:04,409
But it fits me so perfectly.

342
00:20:04,481 --> 00:20:05,625
Look, you're stretching it!

343
00:20:05,696 --> 00:20:07,354
- Take it off right now.
- It's not ruined.

344
00:20:07,424 --> 00:20:09,117
It's nice. You take it off.

345
00:20:09,185 --> 00:20:11,093
- I'm not joking.
- You want some of this?

346
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,630
Stop it, Simon.

347
00:20:12,704 --> 00:20:14,711
- Take it off.
- You take it off.

348
00:20:14,784 --> 00:20:16,060
Coming in.

349
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:21,397
Mom!

350
00:20:22,176 --> 00:20:25,078
- I'm going to tell her right now.
- Go and tell.

351
00:20:25,152 --> 00:20:27,901
- What?
- He's taking Simon to a hotel!

352
00:20:28,511 --> 00:20:30,104
I'm paying for it. What's the problem?

353
00:20:30,175 --> 00:20:31,549
- Can I speak to you?
- You sure can.

354
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,022
Why are you taking him to a hotel?

355
00:20:33,087 --> 00:20:35,257
You didn't see
what they were about to do upstairs.

356
00:20:35,326 --> 00:20:38,195
- Mom, we were just playing.
- Well, playtime is over.

357
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,953
Mr. Jones, I'm not a cross-dresser.

358
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:42,969
Just for the record.

359
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:45,013
- A cross-dresser?
- No.

360
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,033
What are you... It's lingerie.

361
00:20:47,101 --> 00:20:50,265
- You shouldn't even be having any.
- I'm a grown woman, Percy!

362
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,504
- It is not covering up the grown parts!
- What!

363
00:20:52,573 --> 00:20:54,483
Why does the young man
have to go to a hotel?

364
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:56,793
Don't start with me.
This is my house and my rules.

365
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:57,810
Your rules?

366
00:20:57,886 --> 00:20:59,740
This house can't handle
no more testosterone.

367
00:20:59,804 --> 00:21:01,714
We cannot exceed the testosterone level.

368
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:05,434
We gotta keep it like that until the girls
get married. Maybe even beyond that.

369
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:07,508
And I'm not suggesting anyone get married!

370
00:21:07,581 --> 00:21:09,620
Why can't he stay in the basement,
in your room?

371
00:21:09,692 --> 00:21:12,245
Because that's my room!
That's my stuff down there.

372
00:21:12,315 --> 00:21:14,007
- How selfish.
- That doesn't make sense.

373
00:21:14,076 --> 00:21:15,352
It got mold, anyway.

374
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:18,518
Could be black mold. I wouldn't
feel comfortable putting him at risk.

375
00:21:18,587 --> 00:21:20,529
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous that sounds?

376
00:21:20,603 --> 00:21:21,617
No, it's okay.

377
00:21:21,692 --> 00:21:24,058
No, it's not okay!
What are you talking about?

378
00:21:24,124 --> 00:21:27,440
Look, this is your father's house.
We're gonna play it by his rules.

379
00:21:27,515 --> 00:21:30,581
Now, he's obviously set
a testosterone standard.

380
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,024
And I'm going to abide by that.

381
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:35,571
- You falling for that? I'm going with you.
- No, you're not gonna do that.

382
00:21:35,643 --> 00:21:38,742
- You don't want me to go with you?
- Of course I want you to!

383
00:21:38,811 --> 00:21:39,923
But what?

384
00:21:39,995 --> 00:21:41,489
- You need to stay here.
- Hello?

385
00:21:44,378 --> 00:21:45,392
You need to stay here.

386
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:47,953
- No. I want to be with you!
- We're still here!

387
00:21:48,025 --> 00:21:50,960
Are you two gonna be done soon,
or maybe we should have a seat?

388
00:21:51,033 --> 00:21:52,311
Come on, honey. Let's sit...

389
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:55,693
You need to help your mom
with the party arrangements.

390
00:21:56,058 --> 00:21:58,360
We don't want to stress them out, do we?

391
00:21:58,744 --> 00:21:59,727
No.

392
00:22:00,216 --> 00:22:01,742
- All right?
- Yes.

393
00:22:02,457 --> 00:22:06,831
- All right. We're all set.
- I'm glad you all decided. Come on, let's go.

394
00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:09,713
- Come on, get your stuff. Let's go.
- Yeah. All right.

395
00:22:09,784 --> 00:22:13,362
Where is he? Girl!

396
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:14,860
Oh, my God. Are we being audited?

397
00:22:14,935 --> 00:22:16,497
- No, Keisha.
- What's happening?

398
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:20,212
This is Simon. This is Theresa's boyfriend.
This is Keisha, her little sister.

399
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:21,294
Go.

400
00:22:21,368 --> 00:22:24,881
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, this... Yes. Nice to meet you, too.

401
00:22:24,951 --> 00:22:27,767
Good, you all met. Take it to the car.
I'll meet you out there.

402
00:22:27,832 --> 00:22:31,376
- Dad, Theresa's boyfriend is white.
- I know.

403
00:22:31,446 --> 00:22:32,789
I know you know.

404
00:22:32,854 --> 00:22:35,472
I just wanted to see your face
when you heard it again.

405
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:36,720
Not now.

406
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:40,752
- Don't forget we have dinner reservations.
- We'll meet you over there.

407
00:23:05,013 --> 00:23:09,072
She was black as the night

408
00:23:10,228 --> 00:23:13,489
Louie was whiter than white

409
00:23:14,772 --> 00:23:15,721
Danger

410
00:23:16,212 --> 00:23:18,350
Take a walk on the wild side

411
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:21,005
And the colored girls go
doo do doo do doo

412
00:23:34,323 --> 00:23:35,849
Looks like rain.

413
00:23:37,331 --> 00:23:38,378
Nope.

414
00:23:40,658 --> 00:23:44,432
- Those clouds look pretty threatening.
- I live here. I know the weather.

415
00:23:48,018 --> 00:23:52,274
So, Theresa tells me you're in charge
of the loan department at the bank.

416
00:23:52,434 --> 00:23:54,408
That must be a rewarding job.

417
00:24:00,848 --> 00:24:03,566
I'm thinking about making a switch
to a smaller company.

418
00:24:03,632 --> 00:24:05,837
I just think there's less political garbage.

419
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:08,173
You think I don't deal
with political garbage?

420
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:10,728
I got political garbage coming out my ass.

421
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,418
If I give a guy a loan,
I'm married to him for 30 years.

422
00:24:13,487 --> 00:24:16,422
If I deny him, I have to deal with him
in church on Sunday.

423
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:20,292
- I know that feeling.
- Don't try to act like our jobs are alike.

424
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:25,637
Good thing it isn't raining.

425
00:24:26,704 --> 00:24:29,005
That's not rain. It's sprinkling.

426
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:32,204
You might want to turn on
the windshield wipers.

427
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:34,442
I will once it starts raining.

428
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,358
Come on, you two, let's go.

429
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:43,180
- I don't want to be late. Keisha!
- Coming!

430
00:24:43,246 --> 00:24:45,100
Why you always got to knock
on my door first?

431
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:46,442
'Cause you still live here.

432
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:48,614
Let's go. It's raining. I don't wanna be late.

433
00:24:50,735 --> 00:24:51,912
Come on.

434
00:24:57,005 --> 00:24:59,143
Okay, tell me what's it like?

435
00:25:00,044 --> 00:25:03,078
- What's what like?
- Being with a white guy.

436
00:25:04,109 --> 00:25:07,076
- Come on, Keisha, what's the sex like?
- Yeah.

437
00:25:08,492 --> 00:25:09,834
Where's Mom?

438
00:25:09,996 --> 00:25:13,312
She's downstairs, girl. Come on! Bring it.

439
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:17,763
Okay. You know that thing they say
about the size? Completely the opposite.

440
00:25:18,379 --> 00:25:20,169
- Really?
- They're huge.

441
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,288
And not only are their penises big,
but they can sing.

442
00:25:25,003 --> 00:25:26,858
When they get excited, they sing up a storm.

443
00:25:26,924 --> 00:25:29,028
They know a million tunes.
They're like big iPods.

444
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:31,400
Cut it out. Stop it.

445
00:25:33,611 --> 00:25:35,684
Keisha, seriously, is he nice?

446
00:25:35,946 --> 00:25:38,281
- Yeah, and he's cute, too.
- I know.

447
00:25:39,755 --> 00:25:41,991
- What about Mom and Dad?
- Mom is cool with it.

448
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:45,985
I mean, Dad, he seems, you know,
a little on edge, but not more than usual.

449
00:25:46,057 --> 00:25:47,006
Isn't he ever?

450
00:25:47,082 --> 00:25:48,804
- Girls!
- Coming!

451
00:25:49,096 --> 00:25:53,440
But can I just say,
I love you so much right now because...

452
00:25:53,514 --> 00:25:57,637
- Why?
... from now on, no matter what I do, if I...

453
00:25:58,281 --> 00:26:00,833
- crash Dad's car, or if I...
- What's wrong?

454
00:26:00,905 --> 00:26:02,279
...rob a bank...

455
00:26:03,177 --> 00:26:05,796
- if I burn this house down...
- Keisha.

456
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:09,606
...I won't be the one
who brought home the white boy!

457
00:26:13,769 --> 00:26:15,045
Thank you!

458
00:26:18,151 --> 00:26:19,134
Mom!

459
00:26:21,768 --> 00:26:24,549
- Can I help you with your bag, sir?
- I'm okay. I got it.

460
00:26:26,663 --> 00:26:29,051
You don't trust a working man
with your bag?

461
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:31,844
No, I just... It's just one bag.

462
00:26:31,911 --> 00:26:34,212
What do you think,
he'll rifle through your luggage...

463
00:26:34,278 --> 00:26:36,766
and steal your toothbrush
and your fancy conditioner?

464
00:26:37,671 --> 00:26:40,485
- No, that's not it at all.
- Let me tell you something.

465
00:26:40,552 --> 00:26:45,219
Theresa's grandfather was a bellman for
over 60 years and he never stole nothing.

466
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,176
Could you get my bag?

467
00:26:50,247 --> 00:26:52,188
What, he's your slave now?

468
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:53,855
No.

469
00:26:53,926 --> 00:26:56,161
Did you want me to take your bag, sir?

470
00:26:58,085 --> 00:26:59,493
I don't know.

471
00:26:59,812 --> 00:27:01,122
- Next, please.
- Okay.

472
00:27:02,501 --> 00:27:04,923
Hi. Reservation for Percy Jones.

473
00:27:06,596 --> 00:27:08,539
And that's Jones with a " J"?

474
00:27:08,613 --> 00:27:10,270
No, Jones with a "P."

475
00:27:10,341 --> 00:27:12,346
I made the reservation last week.

476
00:27:14,276 --> 00:27:16,796
You knew you were gonna kick me out
a week ago?

477
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:19,650
Son, I knew I was gonna kick you out
24 years ago...

478
00:27:19,715 --> 00:27:21,690
when the doctor announced it was a girl.

479
00:27:21,764 --> 00:27:23,421
- Here you are.
- Good.

480
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,985
- We gave your room away.
- What?

481
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,154
Check-in was at 4:00.

482
00:27:28,227 --> 00:27:31,227
It's Thursday night. I'm quite sure
you got another room available.

483
00:27:31,298 --> 00:27:34,048
I'm sorry, we're completely booked
and so is everyone else.

484
00:27:34,114 --> 00:27:37,049
There's a Shriners convention
in town, actually.

485
00:27:38,051 --> 00:27:40,920
May I help you with anything else,
Mr. Pjones?

486
00:27:42,626 --> 00:27:44,633
I guess I'll have to stay at your house, then.

487
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:48,284
No, there's a crack hotel downtown.
You'll be just fine. Come on.

488
00:27:50,177 --> 00:27:51,388
Next.

489
00:27:53,313 --> 00:27:55,222
Hi. Welcome to Cranford.

490
00:27:56,161 --> 00:28:00,154
- I don't know what your basement's like...
- It's damp. You'd hate it.

491
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:03,799
I don't think dampness is really an issue
at this point.

492
00:28:03,873 --> 00:28:07,517
You can't think about anything but getting
back in the house with my daughter.

493
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:11,032
Mr. Jones, I'm in your house.
I'll obey your rules.

494
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,590
Yeah, right. You'll obey Mr. Jones now...

495
00:28:13,664 --> 00:28:15,607
but when you're up at 3:00 in the morning...

496
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:17,502
all hot and horny, you'll obey Mr. Johnson.

497
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:21,245
You heard the lady. There's no available
hotel rooms in the whole town.

498
00:28:21,311 --> 00:28:25,141
- I'm not gonna do anything. I swear.
- Put your stuff in there. Come on.

499
00:28:29,567 --> 00:28:31,389
You know, dinner's in about 10 minutes.

500
00:28:31,454 --> 00:28:35,284
I don't know what Marilyn is like
about schedule, but I know Theresa is...

501
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:37,342
Stay out of that storm.

502
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,751
All right. You can stay in my basement.

503
00:28:42,045 --> 00:28:46,355
But you remember one thing.
These eyes, they see everything.

504
00:28:46,716 --> 00:28:48,955
Now get in the car. Come on, let's go.

505
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:56,407
Ebony, ivory

506
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,843
living in perfect harmony

507
00:28:58,909 --> 00:29:02,770
Ivory, ebony

508
00:29:04,158 --> 00:29:06,742
So, how long have you two been together?

509
00:29:06,813 --> 00:29:08,504
- Five months.
- Six months.

510
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:10,099
Which one is it?

511
00:29:11,067 --> 00:29:14,450
Well, see, Theresa counts
from the first day that we met.

512
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,790
And I count from the first...

513
00:29:20,763 --> 00:29:23,283
- How's the chicken here?
- It's really good.

514
00:29:23,484 --> 00:29:24,913
Did I tell you two girls...

515
00:29:24,988 --> 00:29:28,151
that for the first dance,
your father and I are gonna do the tango?

516
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,812
- The tango?
- You and Dad?

517
00:29:29,883 --> 00:29:33,658
You know what? Your father and I used to
dance all the time when we were younger.

518
00:29:33,723 --> 00:29:35,862
Sweetheart, I told you
we're not doing a tango.

519
00:29:35,931 --> 00:29:38,418
We're already saying our vows.
That's enough.

520
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,247
We're doing the tango.

521
00:29:40,314 --> 00:29:42,518
Sorry. I forgot to turn it off.

522
00:29:44,217 --> 00:29:46,606
Know what? This is an important call.
I'm just gonna...

523
00:29:46,681 --> 00:29:50,327
No, you can take your call here.
Sit down and take your call.

524
00:29:51,258 --> 00:29:53,810
It's a business call. It's boring stuff.

525
00:29:53,881 --> 00:29:57,012
Business is not boring.
Simon, sit down and take your call.

526
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,029
Sit down.

527
00:30:00,985 --> 00:30:02,391
- Hello.
- Simon?

528
00:30:02,456 --> 00:30:05,839
- Yeah, this is Simon.
- Sorry I didn't get back to you earlier.

529
00:30:05,913 --> 00:30:08,148
I hope Theresa makes good money
as a photographer.

530
00:30:08,216 --> 00:30:10,965
Someone started a rumor
that you're being investigated...

531
00:30:11,032 --> 00:30:12,855
by the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

532
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:18,230
That is so Nathan to do something like that.

533
00:30:18,808 --> 00:30:20,269
I think it's Nathan, too...

534
00:30:20,343 --> 00:30:24,686
'cause this is the last thing he wants to see,
is his best employee going to another firm.

535
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,101
You know me.

536
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:30,927
- I'm always up for a new challenge.
- Are you listening to me?

537
00:30:30,998 --> 00:30:33,420
- You've been blackballed.
- Great!

538
00:30:34,007 --> 00:30:37,269
Guy, it's not my fault.
I'm just telling you what they told me.

539
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,797
I'll call you next week.

540
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:41,489
Did Nathan put you up for another award?

541
00:30:42,357 --> 00:30:44,080
Nothing. It's embarrassing.

542
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:47,697
- Hello. Can I start you off with some drinks?
- Vodka tonic.

543
00:30:51,286 --> 00:30:53,490
Celebrating a great phone call.

544
00:30:54,548 --> 00:30:58,126
Okay. Bring him his liquor,
and bring the rest of us our usual.

545
00:30:58,196 --> 00:31:00,302
They have iced tea and I have my lemonade.

546
00:31:00,373 --> 00:31:03,821
Actually, I think I'm gonna have
a glass of Pinot Grigio.

547
00:31:05,013 --> 00:31:07,762
- And I'll have a Cosmo.
- Me, too.

548
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:13,194
Okay. Bring them their alcohol
and I'll have my usual lemonade.

549
00:31:13,652 --> 00:31:16,369
Someone has to act responsibly
around here.

550
00:31:16,563 --> 00:31:19,214
So, Simon, I hear that you're a singer.

551
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:23,341
What are you, a soprano, an alto, or...

552
00:31:23,763 --> 00:31:25,618
No? Maybe bass?

553
00:31:28,563 --> 00:31:29,872
I don't really sing.

554
00:31:29,939 --> 00:31:31,947
How long can you hold a note?

555
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:33,328
He can hold a note.

556
00:31:33,395 --> 00:31:35,534
- Really?
- For a very long time.

557
00:31:35,604 --> 00:31:37,392
Sing something for me, baby.

558
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:41,809
Are you okay? Drink some water.

559
00:31:42,162 --> 00:31:46,059
Jerry, Nathan's got my ankles
to my earlobes right now. I'm gonna need...

560
00:31:46,578 --> 00:31:48,487
I'm gonna need some cash.

561
00:31:49,843 --> 00:31:53,158
Call me back as soon as you get this.
I need a favor, okay?

562
00:32:07,087 --> 00:32:08,997
You've got to be kidding me.

563
00:32:29,423 --> 00:32:31,756
"Let me see your sexy body go... "

564
00:32:35,503 --> 00:32:38,219
I knew you'd be down here sooner or later.

565
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:41,414
Did you bring some of that
sexy lingerie for me to try?

566
00:32:41,487 --> 00:32:45,064
What is wrong with you, boy?
Don't you have your own underwear?

567
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,061
You like my space?

568
00:32:49,135 --> 00:32:52,297
Yeah. It's very homey. Interesting odor.

569
00:32:52,782 --> 00:32:54,374
I told you it had mold.

570
00:32:54,445 --> 00:32:58,406
Did you come down here for this?
Having a little trouble writing your vows?

571
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,810
That's none of your damn business.

572
00:33:01,582 --> 00:33:05,836
I'm just saying, I could maybe help you
come up with something romantic.

573
00:33:06,445 --> 00:33:09,378
Don't start thinking that you know more
about romance than I do.

574
00:33:09,451 --> 00:33:11,753
With your hand-holding
and feeding each other food...

575
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,511
and wiping off each other's faces.

576
00:33:13,579 --> 00:33:15,106
That's bullshit.

577
00:33:15,468 --> 00:33:17,956
Being married 25 years, that's real romance.

578
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:21,802
And believe me, it's a war.
Brutal. Exhausting.

579
00:33:24,555 --> 00:33:27,272
Sounds like someone
just finished their vows.

580
00:33:29,067 --> 00:33:31,686
- Ready for lights out?
- Looks that way.

581
00:33:33,323 --> 00:33:35,014
- Good night.
- Good night.

582
00:33:36,971 --> 00:33:38,977
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

583
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:48,872
- What are you doing?
- Getting ready to go to sleep.

584
00:33:50,026 --> 00:33:53,026
- Here? You're sleeping here?
- Right here.

585
00:33:53,418 --> 00:33:57,126
- Don't you have a bed upstairs?
- Sure do. So does Theresa.

586
00:33:58,184 --> 00:34:01,763
By me sleeping here assures me
that she'll get a good night's sleep...

587
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:04,102
all alone. Good night.

588
00:34:12,743 --> 00:34:13,856
Sorry.

589
00:34:16,936 --> 00:34:20,197
- What are you doing under there?
- It's just a pillow.

590
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,520
- We might need a barrier.
- A barrier for what?

591
00:34:23,656 --> 00:34:25,695
I tend to move around a lot in my sleep.

592
00:34:25,768 --> 00:34:27,807
How do you know you move around
if you're asleep?

593
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:30,084
Theresa mentioned once that...

594
00:34:30,408 --> 00:34:32,512
I mentioned it to her...

595
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:34,727
after someone else told me...

596
00:34:35,334 --> 00:34:37,026
that wasn't Theresa.

597
00:34:40,134 --> 00:34:43,516
Okay. We can talk about this, right?
Theresa and I have a...

598
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:46,012
- No, you can't talk about it.
... healthy relationship...

599
00:34:46,086 --> 00:34:47,810
- Stop!
- We can't talk about this?

600
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:50,660
I don't wanna hear you talking
about sleeping with my daughter.

601
00:34:50,726 --> 00:34:53,541
You're sleeping with me now.
Now, good night!

602
00:36:03,682 --> 00:36:05,437
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

603
00:36:05,505 --> 00:36:06,965
You're up early.

604
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,658
Or late, depending on how you look at it.

605
00:36:10,912 --> 00:36:13,016
- Coffee?
- Yes. Bless you.

606
00:36:15,328 --> 00:36:17,433
I don't know how you sleep with that man.

607
00:36:17,504 --> 00:36:19,925
- Did he get in your space?
- A little bit.

608
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,041
Did he spoon you?

609
00:36:22,369 --> 00:36:25,564
It was more of a wedge maneuver.

610
00:36:26,974 --> 00:36:29,462
Big man likes to cuddle in his sleep.

611
00:36:30,016 --> 00:36:33,495
I just wish he were a little bit more cuddly
when he was awake.

612
00:36:33,568 --> 00:36:37,722
You know, when my father first met
Percy Jones, he could not stand him.

613
00:36:37,823 --> 00:36:39,033
Really?

614
00:36:39,102 --> 00:36:41,273
But eventually they got along, right?

615
00:36:41,726 --> 00:36:42,708
No.

616
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:46,426
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

617
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:49,147
Good morning, babe.

618
00:36:49,598 --> 00:36:51,703
- I missed you.
- I missed you.

619
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:54,201
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.

620
00:36:59,006 --> 00:37:02,137
- Who's going with me to get some flowers?
- I'll go.

621
00:37:02,302 --> 00:37:05,650
Me, too, if we go early,
because I have to work this afternoon.

622
00:37:09,565 --> 00:37:10,612
Good morning!

623
00:37:10,684 --> 00:37:12,755
You're looking awfully chipper this morning.

624
00:37:12,827 --> 00:37:16,756
Something about knowing your daughter's
not being violated relaxes a man.

625
00:37:16,828 --> 00:37:18,933
I thought you said
that mattress hurts your back.

626
00:37:19,004 --> 00:37:22,452
No, not me.
I could sleep on that mattress every night.

627
00:37:23,195 --> 00:37:24,984
Every single night.

628
00:37:48,923 --> 00:37:51,889
Good morning, boss. Got you some coffee.

629
00:37:52,698 --> 00:37:55,545
- So, what's the verdict?
- What are you talking about?

630
00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:57,497
I'm talking about Theresa's new boyfriend.

631
00:37:57,562 --> 00:38:01,303
What is he, a painter? Poet?
Did he ask you to borrow some money?

632
00:38:01,369 --> 00:38:05,678
My daughter's got great taste in men.
That new guy, he's really something.

633
00:38:06,424 --> 00:38:09,905
- Tell me a little bit about the brother.
- Oh, man, thank you.

634
00:38:10,424 --> 00:38:13,970
I'll tell you about the brother.
He's a big guy. Nice looking.

635
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,949
- What's his name?
- Jamal.

636
00:38:16,792 --> 00:38:19,029
- Graduated Howard University.
- Howard?

637
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:21,207
Played basketball.

638
00:38:21,272 --> 00:38:24,403
He almost went pro.
Till he changed his career to medicine.

639
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:26,838
There was a big write-up on him in Jet
four years ago.

640
00:38:26,903 --> 00:38:28,180
No shit.

641
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:30,061
Parents from Atlanta.

642
00:38:30,135 --> 00:38:33,397
Friends with Mrs. King,
Dr. Cosby, Rev. Jackson.

643
00:38:33,463 --> 00:38:34,805
Come on now.

644
00:38:35,671 --> 00:38:38,769
- Go down towards the middle.
- Go down? Sit up a little bit.

645
00:38:39,606 --> 00:38:42,256
- That's it?
- Man, yeah.

646
00:38:44,247 --> 00:38:47,344
I'm telling you, Reggie.
I'm the luckiest man in Jersey.

647
00:38:47,734 --> 00:38:50,352
My daughter's dating the great black hope.

648
00:38:50,421 --> 00:38:52,209
- You got it.
- That's it.

649
00:38:52,277 --> 00:38:54,099
- Hold it right there.
- I'm not gonna move.

650
00:38:58,645 --> 00:39:00,139
Excuse me? Boss?

651
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:03,276
Simon Green here to see you.

652
00:39:05,684 --> 00:39:07,311
Lifting, you know.

653
00:39:11,187 --> 00:39:14,221
Cut that off, Reggie. Go on, take it out.

654
00:39:14,868 --> 00:39:17,486
Come on, Reggie.
Get on the ball around the...

655
00:39:17,556 --> 00:39:19,247
I'll be right there.

656
00:39:21,235 --> 00:39:24,464
I'll be right out. Give me... Sign something.

657
00:39:28,692 --> 00:39:32,401
- Fred, who is Simon?
- A friend of Theresa's, he says.

658
00:39:32,468 --> 00:39:35,728
Oh, shit.
He better hope Jamal don't find out.

659
00:39:35,986 --> 00:39:38,352
- Be right with you, sir.
- Great.

660
00:39:45,682 --> 00:39:47,820
- Jerry? Hey.
- Simon, what's up?

661
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:52,910
Listen. I need you to get me into that
nanotech IPO. I want 10 blocks.

662
00:39:52,977 --> 00:39:54,286
That's $50,000!

663
00:39:54,418 --> 00:39:56,523
Did you inherit a boatload or something?

664
00:39:56,593 --> 00:40:00,270
The initial public offering comes out
on Tuesday. What do you expect me to do?

665
00:40:00,336 --> 00:40:03,631
I know when it comes out.
I set the damn date, okay?

666
00:40:04,177 --> 00:40:06,119
Just buy it for me on margin.

667
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:08,361
Dude, you don't work here anymore.

668
00:40:09,617 --> 00:40:12,334
I need this IPO to hold me over
until I get another job.

669
00:40:12,402 --> 00:40:14,441
I know you're really screwed right now...

670
00:40:14,513 --> 00:40:16,617
but do you even have $50,000?

671
00:40:17,008 --> 00:40:20,620
I'm gonna sell off my IRAs, okay?
I'll have it in 10 days.

672
00:40:20,784 --> 00:40:22,159
I can't do margin.

673
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,788
I need cash.

674
00:40:23,887 --> 00:40:26,701
I'm in Jersey right now.
Where am I gonna get cash?

675
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:29,319
I'm sure one of those chemical plants
has an ATM machine.

676
00:40:29,391 --> 00:40:31,944
All right, look. I'll get the cash.
Just put in the order.

677
00:40:32,015 --> 00:40:33,509
Cash by Tuesday.

678
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:35,437
I'll bring it to you personally on Monday.

679
00:40:35,502 --> 00:40:37,225
Don't punk out on me.

680
00:40:39,341 --> 00:40:40,551
- Hey.
- Hey.

681
00:40:40,685 --> 00:40:42,575
What are you doing here?

682
00:40:43,055 --> 00:40:45,869
I feel like we didn't get off
on the right foot yesterday...

683
00:40:45,934 --> 00:40:47,876
so I thought maybe...

684
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:50,883
I'd come here and take you to lunch.
Maybe we could bond a little.

685
00:40:50,956 --> 00:40:55,179
I think we bonded just fine around 3:10 this
morning when your knee was in my crotch.

686
00:40:55,246 --> 00:40:56,522
Right.

687
00:40:56,942 --> 00:40:58,153
I'll buy.

688
00:40:59,469 --> 00:41:01,225
- You want to buy me lunch?
- Yeah.

689
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:05,351
I figured it's the proper thing to do
after sleeping with each other.

690
00:41:09,037 --> 00:41:10,084
Okay.

691
00:41:14,285 --> 00:41:17,153
- So, nice bank.
- I'm glad you like it.

692
00:41:18,189 --> 00:41:22,280
I like the small-town feel.
It's less complicated.

693
00:41:22,347 --> 00:41:25,282
Somebody needs money,
they just come in and say:

694
00:41:25,994 --> 00:41:27,883
"Percy, I need a loan. "

695
00:41:28,299 --> 00:41:29,444
Right?

696
00:41:30,764 --> 00:41:33,862
And then, of course, you say,
"Well, yeah. How much?"

697
00:41:34,123 --> 00:41:37,919
They say, "I don't know.
You tell me. $50,000?"

698
00:41:38,314 --> 00:41:40,168
What, you need $50,000?

699
00:41:40,681 --> 00:41:42,592
- Do I need $50,000?
- Yeah.

700
00:41:43,691 --> 00:41:46,309
No. I most assuredly do not.

701
00:41:46,987 --> 00:41:49,190
I was just admiring the process.

702
00:41:57,898 --> 00:42:01,029
How many cylinders does a NASCAR engine
have, six or eight?

703
00:42:01,096 --> 00:42:02,373
- How...
- Yeah.

704
00:42:02,442 --> 00:42:04,774
Six... or eight...

705
00:42:07,304 --> 00:42:12,061
depending on the gas mileage
consumption of the automobile.

706
00:42:12,233 --> 00:42:16,007
You never worked in the pit at NASCAR.
You might as well admit it.

707
00:42:16,776 --> 00:42:19,013
All right, you know, fine.

708
00:42:21,224 --> 00:42:23,907
I never really had an aptitude for engines.

709
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:25,567
Jay... Jeff...

710
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:29,989
Jeff Gordon didn't really trust me
in the pit that much.

711
00:42:30,503 --> 00:42:32,097
But you did drive the cars.

712
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,606
- Drive?
- Yeah.

713
00:42:34,023 --> 00:42:35,965
- Absolutely.
- Good.

714
00:42:56,965 --> 00:42:59,867
All right! Fine! I never drove NASCAR!

715
00:43:00,261 --> 00:43:02,748
But I was nervous
and I wanted to impress you.

716
00:43:02,821 --> 00:43:04,710
You shouldn't have lied.

717
00:43:05,573 --> 00:43:09,347
All right. This is the deal.
We go one lap around.

718
00:43:10,052 --> 00:43:12,671
If you beat me, I'll loan you the money.

719
00:43:14,979 --> 00:43:18,494
- Really?
- I knew it! I knew you needed the money.

720
00:43:18,564 --> 00:43:20,385
I don't need the money!

721
00:43:47,779 --> 00:43:49,305
Move over!

722
00:43:55,651 --> 00:43:57,624
Yeah. Fool!

723
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,025
Sucker!

724
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:53,211
Move it, man!

725
00:44:55,135 --> 00:44:57,174
What the hell are you doing?

726
00:45:03,933 --> 00:45:07,674
- I think it's obvious who came in first.
- You're doggone right. You know I won.

727
00:45:08,028 --> 00:45:12,501
- I was through the bushes before...
- I was through first. I had more speed.

728
00:45:12,572 --> 00:45:14,677
I was through the bushes
and on the asphalt...

729
00:45:14,748 --> 00:45:17,498
- before you even were at the bushes.
- Look.

730
00:45:19,485 --> 00:45:21,142
Dispatch, this is 53 Charlie.

731
00:45:21,211 --> 00:45:24,277
Brian, we got a problem.
Two cars have jumped...

732
00:45:27,805 --> 00:45:29,713
License and registration.

733
00:45:33,851 --> 00:45:36,217
- Poppy!
- There's my beautiful girl.

734
00:45:37,562 --> 00:45:39,353
Simon, I want you to meet my granddad.

735
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:42,234
- Hi, there. Howard Jones.
- Simon Green. Good to meet you, sir.

736
00:45:42,299 --> 00:45:43,728
Nice to meet you.

737
00:45:43,802 --> 00:45:45,591
- Hey, Speed Racer.
- Hey!

738
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:48,919
- What's with the white kid?
- That's Simon. He's my boyfriend.

739
00:45:48,985 --> 00:45:51,288
Your boyfriend?
You didn't tell me he was white.

740
00:45:51,354 --> 00:45:52,532
- Yes, I did.
- When?

741
00:45:52,602 --> 00:45:54,577
- Back at the home.
- I thought you was kidding.

742
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:56,538
Okay. Well, I think that's it.

743
00:45:56,953 --> 00:45:59,341
I think you're forgetting about the vodka.

744
00:45:59,416 --> 00:46:00,977
Say grace, Percy.

745
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:05,232
Thank you, Lord. Amen.

746
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:09,684
- That was fast.
- The Lord knows I'm busy.

747
00:46:09,881 --> 00:46:12,847
- Simon, pass on the broccoli, please.
- Yes, sir.

748
00:46:13,048 --> 00:46:16,463
So, what, they don't have any available
young black men in New York anymore?

749
00:46:16,536 --> 00:46:18,607
They just ran out last week, Grandpa.

750
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:22,128
I'm just trying to figure out
why you chose to go this way.

751
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,404
- Don't mind him.
- It's okay.

752
00:46:24,728 --> 00:46:26,767
My grandmother loved you
when she first met you.

753
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:29,687
But later she said some things.
I was like, "Wow, Grandma. "

754
00:46:30,424 --> 00:46:33,106
- What kind of things?
- Yeah, what kind of things?

755
00:46:33,654 --> 00:46:35,345
Nothing. Just things.

756
00:46:36,022 --> 00:46:37,647
- Such as?
- Yeah, such as?

757
00:46:37,718 --> 00:46:39,759
- Daddy? I got it.
- I know.

758
00:46:43,192 --> 00:46:45,524
You know what?
You're gonna laugh when you hear this.

759
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:48,885
She said that Theresa was a very pretty girl.

760
00:46:50,485 --> 00:46:52,241
- That's so nice.
- Good taste.

761
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:55,887
So I ask her
what she liked about you the most, right?

762
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:57,167
She said...

763
00:46:57,238 --> 00:47:00,947
She says, "I just love
her cute, little, nappy little head. "

764
00:47:05,908 --> 00:47:08,811
- Your grandmother, where does she live?
- Brooklyn. Why?

765
00:47:08,885 --> 00:47:12,878
I just wanna know how far I'd have to travel
to kick her old white ass, that's why!

766
00:47:12,949 --> 00:47:14,158
Grandpa.

767
00:47:14,388 --> 00:47:16,494
You don't call my grandchild
no nappy head!

768
00:47:16,564 --> 00:47:19,629
Did she say that while putting on a sheet
for the Klan rally?

769
00:47:19,699 --> 00:47:22,066
Settle down, now! Hand me the butter.

770
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:25,066
- My grandmother's not a malicious woman.
- No, she's not.

771
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:27,921
She's 82. She comes from a different time.

772
00:47:27,988 --> 00:47:29,962
I'm 74 and I come from a different time.

773
00:47:30,036 --> 00:47:32,589
You don't hear me calling white folks
honky and flat-ass!

774
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:33,967
- Casper.
- Cracker.

775
00:47:34,034 --> 00:47:35,463
- Ofay.
- Peckerwood.

776
00:47:35,539 --> 00:47:37,197
- Wonder bread.
- Bird shit.

777
00:47:37,265 --> 00:47:38,413
Bird shit?

778
00:47:38,484 --> 00:47:40,109
It's almost white.

779
00:47:40,627 --> 00:47:41,739
That's pretty good.

780
00:47:41,811 --> 00:47:43,915
Howard. Percy!

781
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:47,598
It's okay.

782
00:47:48,018 --> 00:47:51,084
I'm really sorry
about what my grandmother said...

783
00:47:51,313 --> 00:47:54,096
but there are some people
you're just never gonna change...

784
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:56,016
- as much as you'd like to.
- Yep.

785
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:58,699
I can tell you this. Last Thanksgiving...

786
00:47:58,961 --> 00:48:01,808
my Uncle Dave said a black joke
at the table, right?

787
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:05,925
So I said, right in front of the whole family,
"Look, that's inappropriate.

788
00:48:06,032 --> 00:48:07,975
"We're not gonna have it. "

789
00:48:09,552 --> 00:48:13,414
I think that's how you change people.
You just gotta attack it one at a time.

790
00:48:13,488 --> 00:48:14,502
Exactly.

791
00:48:14,576 --> 00:48:16,103
What was the joke?

792
00:48:16,656 --> 00:48:17,900
Excuse me?

793
00:48:19,247 --> 00:48:20,589
Tell the joke.

794
00:48:21,295 --> 00:48:24,013
- I don't remember it.
- Sure you do. Tell the joke.

795
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,110
- Really, I don't remember it. It was...
- Dad.

796
00:48:27,343 --> 00:48:28,520
Chicken.

797
00:48:29,712 --> 00:48:31,784
- Excuse me?
- I didn't stutter.

798
00:48:31,856 --> 00:48:34,888
Okay, you know what? I'll tell the joke.

799
00:48:35,022 --> 00:48:37,641
- No, Simon. You don't...
- Baby, it's okay.

800
00:48:37,904 --> 00:48:39,331
I'll tell you why.

801
00:48:39,407 --> 00:48:43,400
Because by not telling the joke,
I'm empowering it. Right? So I'll just...

802
00:48:44,429 --> 00:48:47,812
tell the joke and expose
how simple-minded...

803
00:48:48,238 --> 00:48:51,205
and crude and unfunny it actually is.

804
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:55,048
What do you call...

805
00:48:59,948 --> 00:49:03,080
What do you call 100 black men...

806
00:49:03,597 --> 00:49:06,116
buried in the ground up to their neck?

807
00:49:07,342 --> 00:49:09,316
- What?
- Afro-Turf.

808
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,602
- That's cute.
- What are you laughing at?

809
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:17,188
- It's cute.
- Cute don't make it funny.

810
00:49:17,644 --> 00:49:18,789
Tell another.

811
00:49:18,891 --> 00:49:21,226
- Dad, no.
- Let the man tell a joke!

812
00:49:22,028 --> 00:49:24,067
I don't know any other ones.

813
00:49:25,932 --> 00:49:30,666
Obviously, I've heard other black jokes,
but I think I've proven my point.

814
00:49:30,763 --> 00:49:33,152
So it's okay to empower the other ones?

815
00:49:33,643 --> 00:49:37,505
Okay. I see what you're doing here,
you're putting me on the spot.

816
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:40,677
It's okay. Look, it's fine.
'Cause I'm not gonna back down.

817
00:49:40,747 --> 00:49:41,924
Back down, Simon.

818
00:49:41,996 --> 00:49:45,671
The only way to break down barriers
is to have everything out in the open.

819
00:49:45,738 --> 00:49:46,982
- Right?
- Exactly.

820
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,937
So, what do you call...

821
00:49:49,706 --> 00:49:53,503
one black man being chased
by 300 white men?

822
00:49:54,281 --> 00:49:56,768
- What?
- The PGA Tour.

823
00:49:58,186 --> 00:49:59,613
I get it.

824
00:49:59,688 --> 00:50:01,063
Tiger Woods. There it is.

825
00:50:01,162 --> 00:50:02,535
That's good.

826
00:50:03,241 --> 00:50:04,801
Tell another one.

827
00:50:07,465 --> 00:50:10,694
How do we know that Adam and Eve
weren't black?

828
00:50:11,688 --> 00:50:12,636
How?

829
00:50:12,712 --> 00:50:15,779
You ever try to take a rib away
from a black man?

830
00:50:18,568 --> 00:50:19,713
That's pretty good.

831
00:50:19,784 --> 00:50:23,297
- That's pretty good.
- I wouldn't take one from you, I know that!

832
00:50:23,368 --> 00:50:26,565
- You chewing it down to the bone.
- That's a good one.

833
00:50:26,919 --> 00:50:30,148
- He's a rib fan.
- Don't try.

834
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:31,843
- Tell more.
- Okay.

835
00:50:31,911 --> 00:50:34,213
- Why don't black people like country music?
- Why?

836
00:50:34,278 --> 00:50:38,720
'Cause every time they say "hoe-down,"
they think someone shot their sister.

837
00:50:41,991 --> 00:50:44,291
You gonna be all right?

838
00:50:47,174 --> 00:50:48,701
That is so true.

839
00:50:48,806 --> 00:50:51,937
- That's a tailored joke for you.
- Why I gotta be a ho?

840
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:53,828
Ain't nobody talking about you.

841
00:50:53,894 --> 00:50:55,584
- It's a sister joke!
- You're sisters.

842
00:50:55,654 --> 00:50:57,247
I'm not the "ho sister. "

843
00:50:57,318 --> 00:50:59,651
Come on now. Can't stop now, baby.

844
00:51:00,133 --> 00:51:02,980
What are three things
that a black man can't get?

845
00:51:03,045 --> 00:51:05,149
What is that he can't he get?

846
00:51:06,533 --> 00:51:09,827
A black eye, a fat lip, and a job.

847
00:51:15,844 --> 00:51:18,177
I tell you I'm going to kick this boy's ass!

848
00:51:18,244 --> 00:51:20,927
- Grandpa.
- No, it's...

849
00:51:21,636 --> 00:51:24,931
We know you can take him,
but just sit down. Be nice. Come on.

850
00:51:25,956 --> 00:51:28,890
- Come on, now. It's a joke.
- That's right, Daddy.

851
00:51:28,963 --> 00:51:30,969
Sit down. It's just a joke.

852
00:51:31,298 --> 00:51:34,015
Come on. Hee-hee, ha-ha. That's all it is.

853
00:51:37,443 --> 00:51:39,386
Now if you'll excuse me...

854
00:51:40,003 --> 00:51:42,108
all of a sudden, I lost my appetite.

855
00:51:45,665 --> 00:51:47,487
Think I'll take a walk.

856
00:51:56,577 --> 00:51:59,774
- I should have stopped at "hoe-down. "
- You should have never started.

857
00:51:59,841 --> 00:52:03,037
This isn't like us at home,
laughing about this bullshit.

858
00:52:03,105 --> 00:52:04,894
It's my father's house, Simon.

859
00:52:04,961 --> 00:52:07,928
What do you want me to do,
go upstairs and apologize to him again?

860
00:52:08,001 --> 00:52:09,016
No.

861
00:52:10,047 --> 00:52:12,285
Let the storm pass. It'll be fine.

862
00:52:13,889 --> 00:52:15,294
Besides, he dared you!

863
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,498
- He double-dared! He called me chicken.
- I heard!

864
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:20,863
- I can't be called chicken.
- You have to watch him on those.

865
00:52:21,632 --> 00:52:25,625
You know? I'm fresh out of ideas
as to how to impress your father.

866
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:29,405
Telling black jokes is never a good idea,
but that's just me.

867
00:52:29,472 --> 00:52:30,748
You think?

868
00:52:36,767 --> 00:52:38,328
I'll talk to him.

869
00:52:42,975 --> 00:52:44,436
Say nice things about me.

870
00:52:44,509 --> 00:52:47,858
No, I'm not going to say nice things
about you. You are still punished.

871
00:52:47,966 --> 00:52:51,797
Baby, I'm a good guy.
I like ribs, too. I don't...

872
00:52:54,526 --> 00:52:56,381
Why are you being so mean to me?

873
00:52:56,445 --> 00:52:58,966
- My grandfather's out there.
- He's not going to come in.

874
00:52:59,038 --> 00:53:01,559
- This is my mom's kitchen!
- She's not going to come in.

875
00:53:01,629 --> 00:53:03,930
You're still gonna do the dishes.

876
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,701
- Get off me.
- Fine, I'll do the dishes.

877
00:53:08,188 --> 00:53:10,130
Here, do the broccoli one.

878
00:53:13,053 --> 00:53:15,921
- Dad, I have to talk to you.
- What?

879
00:53:16,252 --> 00:53:19,066
- Why did you do that?
- I didn't start it. Mr. Nappy Head did.

880
00:53:19,131 --> 00:53:21,750
Dad, Simon's a good man.
He has a good heart.

881
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:23,959
- A good man?
- You put him on the spot.

882
00:53:24,029 --> 00:53:25,238
You really think so?

883
00:53:25,308 --> 00:53:27,217
What is your problem with him anyways?

884
00:53:27,291 --> 00:53:29,778
Besides the fact, of course, that he's white.

885
00:53:29,851 --> 00:53:33,396
You gonna get in a heap of trouble
talking to me like that.

886
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:37,107
Don't care nothing about that man
being white. He's hiding something.

887
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,586
What? NASCAR?

888
00:53:39,931 --> 00:53:41,904
You thought I didn't know?

889
00:53:42,235 --> 00:53:46,064
Of course I knew.
We talk about everything, Simon and I.

890
00:53:47,706 --> 00:53:51,121
Daddy, I love him,
and you need to start respecting that.

891
00:53:51,546 --> 00:53:54,992
Then you respect me enough to tell me
in advance who you're bringing home.

892
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,432
- I didn't think you'd care.
- But you weren't sure.

893
00:53:57,497 --> 00:53:59,636
- So you decided to test me.
- No, of course not.

894
00:53:59,706 --> 00:54:01,266
- So you're looking for a reaction?
- No.

895
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:02,613
So what are you looking for?

896
00:54:02,681 --> 00:54:06,675
I'm looking for you to tell me
that it's okay for me to be with him.

897
00:54:14,808 --> 00:54:16,117
I'm scared.

898
00:54:17,944 --> 00:54:18,991
Okay?

899
00:54:19,897 --> 00:54:21,718
I'm really scared, Dad.

900
00:54:22,487 --> 00:54:25,718
I know things are different now
and times have changed...

901
00:54:25,785 --> 00:54:29,525
but you should really hear the kind of things
that people say to us sometimes.

902
00:54:29,591 --> 00:54:31,630
And the way they look at us.

903
00:54:34,038 --> 00:54:37,236
I need you to tell me
that it's okay to be with him.

904
00:54:38,711 --> 00:54:42,257
Baby, me telling you it's okay
is not gonna change the world.

905
00:54:42,326 --> 00:54:44,661
Dad. But it would change my world.

906
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:48,299
It will change my world
if I know that you're behind us.

907
00:54:48,374 --> 00:54:50,709
I'm always behind you, sweetheart.

908
00:54:52,054 --> 00:54:53,363
And I love you.

909
00:54:54,549 --> 00:54:56,654
It's my job to keep you safe.

910
00:54:57,588 --> 00:54:59,597
And I don't trust that kid.

911
00:55:16,564 --> 00:55:18,222
- Hey, baby.
- Yes.

912
00:55:18,323 --> 00:55:21,869
I'm trying to figure out where he got
all those doggone black jokes.

913
00:55:21,939 --> 00:55:24,209
What do white people do, take a class...

914
00:55:24,276 --> 00:55:26,664
sit around and think of new jokes
about the black man?

915
00:55:26,739 --> 00:55:28,430
I don't know, Percy.

916
00:55:28,723 --> 00:55:30,763
You need to let that one go.

917
00:55:31,379 --> 00:55:34,827
Come on, sweetheart.
We need to practice the tango.

918
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,038
I told you. I ain't doing no doggone tango.

919
00:55:37,108 --> 00:55:39,857
Why? You think you can't dance anymore?

920
00:55:39,922 --> 00:55:43,336
No. I think the tango's a stupid dance
and I ain't doing it.

921
00:55:45,585 --> 00:55:46,863
Marilyn...

922
00:55:47,986 --> 00:55:51,401
why can't we do the hustle?
What's wrong with the hustle?

923
00:55:51,826 --> 00:55:54,990
Because the hustle is a stupid dance...

924
00:55:55,058 --> 00:55:57,064
and I want to do the tango.

925
00:56:01,137 --> 00:56:03,559
Look here, woman,
can't we do this some other time?

926
00:56:03,634 --> 00:56:05,968
I gotta take Dad back to the home.

927
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:10,155
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

928
00:57:58,537 --> 00:57:59,486
Shut up!

929
00:58:02,889 --> 00:58:06,084
All right, stop.
Okay, move a little to your left.

930
00:58:06,153 --> 00:58:07,778
- Okay.
- All right, kiss me.

931
00:58:07,849 --> 00:58:10,696
This is the exact spot
where I had my first kiss.

932
00:58:10,952 --> 00:58:14,726
No! I'm not going to kiss you in the spot
that you had your first kiss.

933
00:58:14,984 --> 00:58:17,123
- No.
- Why not?

934
00:58:17,672 --> 00:58:20,192
It's some other guy's spot.

935
00:58:21,225 --> 00:58:22,239
Fine.

936
00:58:23,304 --> 00:58:25,191
- What was his name?
- Curtis Booker.

937
00:58:25,256 --> 00:58:27,524
He had these big old Bucky Beaver teeth.

938
00:58:27,592 --> 00:58:30,624
But he was such a nice boy.
He was a good kisser, too.

939
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:33,279
- Better than me?
- Way better.

940
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:34,973
- Way better?
- Yeah.

941
00:58:35,047 --> 00:58:36,837
- Did he grab your ass?
- No.

942
00:58:36,903 --> 00:58:38,789
- Squeeze it?
- No. We were 13.

943
00:58:38,855 --> 00:58:41,221
- Grab you down here?
- No. Come on!

944
00:58:44,102 --> 00:58:45,925
- Slow down.
- Come on.

945
00:58:48,582 --> 00:58:52,159
- There's a car! Get out of the way!
- Come on! Yeah!

946
00:58:58,277 --> 00:58:59,837
Okay, be careful.

947
00:59:03,333 --> 00:59:05,243
So, this is my favorite spot.

948
00:59:07,108 --> 00:59:09,018
It's pretty amazing, huh?

949
00:59:09,701 --> 00:59:11,707
All right, so it's not...

950
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:14,846
the top of the world, but it's nice.

951
00:59:16,837 --> 00:59:18,211
It's a fort.

952
00:59:20,133 --> 00:59:21,856
It's a gun placement.

953
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:26,144
When I was little, I would sneak
out of the house in the middle of the night...

954
00:59:26,211 --> 00:59:30,301
and just come out here and just dream.

955
00:59:30,819 --> 00:59:31,899
Yeah?

956
00:59:32,868 --> 00:59:35,289
Weren't you afraid of sneaking
out of your house?

957
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:37,784
Please. I'm not afraid of Percy Jones.

958
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:42,873
Well, that makes you and... you.

959
00:59:46,626 --> 00:59:48,830
Okay, so this is just Cranford.

960
00:59:49,538 --> 00:59:53,596
But it's a great place to grow up.
It's a good place to raise a family, too.

961
00:59:57,473 --> 00:59:59,961
You know, maybe we shouldn't do this.

962
01:00:00,256 --> 01:00:02,199
What? Live in the suburbs?

963
01:00:02,529 --> 01:00:06,074
No. Tell your parents
about our engagement this weekend.

964
01:00:07,392 --> 01:00:10,808
Simon, I told you not to look at him
straight in the eye.

965
01:00:12,673 --> 01:00:15,160
I don't think Percy Jones is ready.

966
01:00:15,584 --> 01:00:18,006
I think Percy Jones needs more time.

967
01:00:18,464 --> 01:00:20,701
A lot more time for Percy Jones.

968
01:00:21,376 --> 01:00:23,797
- Are you getting cold feet, Simon?
- No.

969
01:00:25,344 --> 01:00:27,482
No, I'm not getting cold feet.

970
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:30,229
I can't wait to marry you.

971
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:33,052
Make babies with you.

972
01:00:35,103 --> 01:00:37,918
Give me a daughter that looks just like you.

973
01:00:42,142 --> 01:00:43,736
I can work on that.

974
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:45,147
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

975
01:00:45,982 --> 01:00:48,666
And hopefully, I can be a good dad.

976
01:00:49,598 --> 01:00:51,737
I think you'll be a great dad.

977
01:00:51,902 --> 01:00:54,771
You're never gonna be
like your father, Simon.

978
01:00:58,621 --> 01:01:00,564
Maybe I can be like yours.

979
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:02,163
- Like Percy?
- Yeah.

980
01:01:02,237 --> 01:01:04,725
- No.
- Baby, Percy Jones is a good dad.

981
01:01:05,501 --> 01:01:07,158
He's there for you.

982
01:01:07,389 --> 01:01:10,072
He cares about you. He loves you so much.

983
01:01:10,396 --> 01:01:11,574
He does.

984
01:01:12,701 --> 01:01:14,523
We just have to get him to love you.

985
01:01:14,588 --> 01:01:18,996
Maybe we can start by getting him to take
the padlock off the basement door.

986
01:01:19,869 --> 01:01:21,778
It's not going to happen.

987
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:25,489
Why don't you give me
a little Curtis Booker?

988
01:01:25,564 --> 01:01:27,058
I can't believe I told you that.

989
01:01:27,131 --> 01:01:29,848
- Come on, baby, a little Bucky Beaver?
- No.

990
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:32,562
No. How about some Simon Green?

991
01:02:07,801 --> 01:02:10,289
Marilyn, you cut off the porch light?

992
01:02:16,248 --> 01:02:17,710
That's my girl.

993
01:02:25,207 --> 01:02:26,614
Very stylish.

994
01:02:27,127 --> 01:02:30,838
I need to take a quarter inch off the pants.
I can do it here. Let me have them.

995
01:02:30,904 --> 01:02:32,464
What, you mean take the pants off?

996
01:02:32,536 --> 01:02:35,851
I could do with you in them
but I don't want to poke you with my needle.

997
01:02:35,927 --> 01:02:38,741
You keep your eyes on the pants,
you hear me?

998
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:51,699
Mr. Jones, do you know
where the extra chairs are?

999
01:02:51,766 --> 01:02:53,805
What are you, blind?
They're against the wall.

1000
01:02:53,877 --> 01:02:56,016
- When you go out, close the door.
- Right.

1001
01:02:56,086 --> 01:02:58,868
Percy, put some pants on.
We got people in the house.

1002
01:02:58,934 --> 01:03:01,487
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sweetheart. I didn't realize.

1003
01:03:02,421 --> 01:03:03,665
How long's it gonna take?

1004
01:03:03,733 --> 01:03:06,417
- Two shakes of a lamb's tail.
- Whatever the hell that means.

1005
01:03:06,485 --> 01:03:08,590
Mercy, Percy! Keep your shirt on!

1006
01:03:08,661 --> 01:03:10,569
Or take it off. Whatever.

1007
01:03:10,837 --> 01:03:14,185
Could someone answer
that damn phone? Thank you!

1008
01:03:17,299 --> 01:03:20,169
- Jones residence.
- This is Reggie. Who's this?

1009
01:03:21,268 --> 01:03:25,807
- This is Theresa's boyfriend.
- Jamal! What's up, man?

1010
01:03:25,876 --> 01:03:28,843
- Percy told me all about you.
- What's that?

1011
01:03:28,914 --> 01:03:32,047
My name is Reggie.
Percy told me all about you, man.

1012
01:03:32,116 --> 01:03:33,162
He did?

1013
01:03:33,235 --> 01:03:37,261
You know what we should do?
Get together and play some hoops, man.

1014
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:39,656
I don't really play hoops.

1015
01:03:39,954 --> 01:03:42,410
Come on, man. Don't be shy.
Why are you being shy?

1016
01:03:42,483 --> 01:03:46,444
Percy told me that you went to Howard.
He said you almost went pro.

1017
01:03:46,643 --> 01:03:48,018
- He said that?
- Yeah.

1018
01:03:48,082 --> 01:03:51,791
He was bragging all about you, Jamal.
But listen...

1019
01:03:51,857 --> 01:03:55,021
two things.
One: Could you autograph the issue...

1020
01:03:55,089 --> 01:03:58,919
of Jet for me? And the other thing is,
I would love to meet the Cosbys.

1021
01:03:58,994 --> 01:04:02,638
When I say love to meet them,
I mean I love to meet them.

1022
01:04:02,897 --> 01:04:05,613
- I'll see what I can do.
- I feel like I grew up with them.

1023
01:04:05,681 --> 01:04:07,088
Let me get Percy for you.

1024
01:04:07,154 --> 01:04:09,836
You know, in the '80s and whatnot and...

1025
01:04:09,905 --> 01:04:13,581
- It's for you. It's Reggie.
- We were talking about the Cosbys.

1026
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,746
- May I have some privacy, please?
- But, yeah, you know what I mean?

1027
01:04:17,201 --> 01:04:19,273
- And shut the door.
- I'd still love to meet them.

1028
01:04:19,792 --> 01:04:20,740
Theo...

1029
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:24,331
Reggie. What did you find out?

1030
01:04:24,399 --> 01:04:27,878
You were right about Simon Green.
He is no longer at J.P. Oliver.

1031
01:04:27,951 --> 01:04:29,894
Come on. Give me my pants.

1032
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:32,619
- Jamal, huh?
- Don't start.

1033
01:04:32,687 --> 01:04:36,582
This isn't about me. It's about you
and your job, that you don't have anymore.

1034
01:04:36,655 --> 01:04:39,338
- What?
- Yeah. Move out of my way.

1035
01:04:39,567 --> 01:04:40,843
Hey, baby!

1036
01:04:41,583 --> 01:04:44,300
Theresa! Come here, sweetheart.
Daddy needs to talk to you.

1037
01:04:44,368 --> 01:04:47,017
- Don't listen to him.
- What are you talking about?

1038
01:04:47,087 --> 01:04:50,501
Your boyfriend's unemployed, lost his job.
He got fired a couple days ago.

1039
01:04:50,574 --> 01:04:52,231
I did not get fired! I quit!

1040
01:04:52,302 --> 01:04:54,407
You quit? Why didn't you tell me this?

1041
01:04:54,478 --> 01:04:57,411
- It's complicated.
- It's complicated when you're a liar.

1042
01:04:57,484 --> 01:05:01,608
I'm a liar?
What about the lies you told Reggie?

1043
01:05:01,741 --> 01:05:03,203
- Jamal?
- Who's Jamal?

1044
01:05:03,278 --> 01:05:05,831
- He's good friends with the Cosbys.
- What about NASCAR?

1045
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:08,235
That was nothing, and I admitted it.

1046
01:05:08,301 --> 01:05:11,431
- You admitted that you lied.
- You tried to kill me with a go-kart.

1047
01:05:11,501 --> 01:05:13,126
At least I can drive.

1048
01:05:13,196 --> 01:05:16,196
This crazy ass almost got us arrested.
Now we both got court dates.

1049
01:05:16,268 --> 01:05:18,058
I can't believe you checked up on me.

1050
01:05:18,124 --> 01:05:20,873
- You kept asking me for money.
- I never asked you for money.

1051
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:24,321
- You asked my father for money?
- $50,000 loan, baby.

1052
01:05:24,395 --> 01:05:26,762
- I did not. He trapped me into it.
- You're a liar.

1053
01:05:26,827 --> 01:05:28,518
You were checking up on him?

1054
01:05:28,588 --> 01:05:31,174
He forced my hand.
You're my daughter and he's not worthy!

1055
01:05:31,243 --> 01:05:32,804
- That's not for you to decide.
- Right!

1056
01:05:32,876 --> 01:05:35,690
And what about you, lying to me?
You said you would never lie.

1057
01:05:35,756 --> 01:05:37,216
You ain't gotta go over there.

1058
01:05:37,291 --> 01:05:38,665
I thought I could get another job.

1059
01:05:38,731 --> 01:05:41,633
I was gonna tell you,
but I didn't want to ruin the big weekend.

1060
01:05:41,707 --> 01:05:43,977
You said we would
always tell each other the truth.

1061
01:05:44,043 --> 01:05:47,109
Like how you told your parents
about me being white?

1062
01:05:47,179 --> 01:05:50,887
- I knew they wouldn't care about that.
- I don't care. I care that you're a liar.

1063
01:05:50,954 --> 01:05:54,980
That's bullshit! You care.
He has to care. It's human nature.

1064
01:05:55,562 --> 01:05:57,536
That means that you care that I'm black?

1065
01:05:57,609 --> 01:05:59,365
- Do you?
- Dad!

1066
01:06:01,066 --> 01:06:04,414
No. It doesn't matter what I say.
You people are gonna think I'm a racist.

1067
01:06:04,488 --> 01:06:08,068
- You hear that? "You people. "
- I know. I heard. What people?

1068
01:06:09,097 --> 01:06:10,951
The people in the yard.

1069
01:06:13,705 --> 01:06:16,672
That's what I'm... See?
I say one thing and I'm a racist!

1070
01:06:16,745 --> 01:06:19,527
- No, Simon, you're a liar.
- And a racist.

1071
01:06:20,424 --> 01:06:23,555
Where do you get off calling me a racist?
I have a black girlfriend!

1072
01:06:23,623 --> 01:06:25,924
- You had a black girlfriend!
- Have.

1073
01:06:25,991 --> 01:06:28,512
Past tense! Had!
And let me tell you something else, son...

1074
01:06:28,584 --> 01:06:31,235
- What the hell is going on?
- I'll tell you what's going on.

1075
01:06:31,303 --> 01:06:34,881
- He got fired from J.P. Oliver!
- I did not get fired! I quit!

1076
01:06:34,952 --> 01:06:37,372
- I told you to stay out of Theresa's life.
- Thank you.

1077
01:06:37,446 --> 01:06:40,031
He can't just walk in our house,
telling our baby lies.

1078
01:06:40,102 --> 01:06:42,492
- I'm not lying!
- I don't think so!

1079
01:06:43,304 --> 01:06:46,434
- The party's off, Percy.
- Woman, you must be crazy.

1080
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:49,569
I don't want to say my vows with you.
It would be a lie before God.

1081
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:51,874
Marilyn, we're saying
some goddamn vows tomorrow.

1082
01:06:51,942 --> 01:06:55,324
- Yeah, he got a book and everything.
- Would you shut up?

1083
01:06:55,749 --> 01:06:57,344
You got your vows out of a book?

1084
01:06:57,415 --> 01:07:01,189
No. Don't listen to him! I got a book.
I'm using it for inspiration.

1085
01:07:01,253 --> 01:07:03,904
- He wrote it down word for word.
- You're going to get hurt.

1086
01:07:03,972 --> 01:07:05,981
- That is so pathetic!
- Come on, Marilyn!

1087
01:07:06,054 --> 01:07:09,467
Because if memory serves me correctly,
I used to be inspiration enough.

1088
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:10,751
You still are!

1089
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:12,861
You'd be inspiration to me. He neglects you.

1090
01:07:12,933 --> 01:07:15,419
Marilyn, get your ass back here!

1091
01:07:15,493 --> 01:07:17,729
I got a $200 cake coming tomorrow!

1092
01:07:17,796 --> 01:07:21,341
Sixty pounds of shrimp!
Sixty pounds of shrimp, woman!

1093
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:23,233
I had to take a second on the house!

1094
01:07:23,299 --> 01:07:26,615
- She looked angry.
- Marilyn, don't let me raise my voice now!

1095
01:07:26,691 --> 01:07:28,318
You gonna force me to use the muscle!

1096
01:07:28,388 --> 01:07:29,698
Hope you like seafood.

1097
01:07:37,379 --> 01:07:38,785
Theresa! Wait!

1098
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,069
Come on!

1099
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:46,715
- They'll be back.
- No, they're not coming back.

1100
01:07:46,786 --> 01:07:49,207
They gotta come back.
Sixty pounds of shrimp!

1101
01:07:49,282 --> 01:07:51,224
Come on, baby. Pick it up.

1102
01:07:53,058 --> 01:07:56,439
Answer that phone, sweetheart,
and it will be your last.

1103
01:07:59,107 --> 01:08:00,535
Let me borrow your car.

1104
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:04,156
What? You can't go chasing behind
no women. Have some dignity!

1105
01:08:04,226 --> 01:08:06,330
Besides, you can't even drive
a damn go-kart!

1106
01:08:10,592 --> 01:08:12,283
Trouble in paradise?

1107
01:08:26,975 --> 01:08:29,278
Baby, we need to talk about this.

1108
01:08:29,473 --> 01:08:32,058
You should call me
and we should talk about it like adults...

1109
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:34,549
because adults communicate
when they have problems.

1110
01:08:34,623 --> 01:08:38,103
I'm looking at your photos on the wall
and they're beautiful.

1111
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:42,907
Beautiful photos. I don't think that
I compliment you on your work enough.

1112
01:08:42,975 --> 01:08:47,612
You know what? You're being rude.
That's what you're being. So call me back.

1113
01:08:50,302 --> 01:08:52,157
Baby, I'm sorry. You're not being rude.

1114
01:08:52,222 --> 01:08:55,221
You have all the reason in the world
to be upset with me right now.

1115
01:08:55,293 --> 01:08:59,319
You shouldn't be calling me back.
If I was you, I wouldn't call me back.

1116
01:08:59,613 --> 01:09:01,272
Baby, call me back.

1117
01:09:01,981 --> 01:09:03,257
Call me back, baby.

1118
01:09:03,325 --> 01:09:06,325
I'm looking at your bulletin board
and there's a picture of you...

1119
01:09:06,398 --> 01:09:09,975
sitting next to a guy and I think
that that guy might be Curtis Booker.

1120
01:09:10,044 --> 01:09:11,867
He looks like he's got Bucky Beaver teeth.

1121
01:09:11,933 --> 01:09:14,136
He looks a lot older than 13!

1122
01:09:14,204 --> 01:09:17,140
So I don't know how you feel about it,
but it's gone!

1123
01:09:17,214 --> 01:09:19,318
Old Curtis Booker can go bye-bye!

1124
01:09:22,235 --> 01:09:24,177
Baby, do you have any Scotch Tape?

1125
01:09:24,251 --> 01:09:27,547
You're acting like I cheated on you,
and I've never cheated on you...

1126
01:09:27,613 --> 01:09:31,507
except for that one time with myself,
and you caught me.

1127
01:09:46,074 --> 01:09:47,056
Hello.

1128
01:09:47,131 --> 01:09:49,715
Darlene! How you doing?
This is Percy Jones.

1129
01:09:49,786 --> 01:09:53,648
I'm looking for Marilyn. She left a little
earlier. I thought she'd be back by now.

1130
01:09:53,722 --> 01:09:57,170
- I'm sorry. Now, who is this?
- Percy Jones.

1131
01:09:57,305 --> 01:10:00,054
I'm sorry, Percy.
I must have fell asleep on the couch.

1132
01:10:00,121 --> 01:10:02,225
Baby, you say you looking for Marilyn?

1133
01:10:02,297 --> 01:10:04,534
- Have you seen her?
- Well, now, what happened?

1134
01:10:04,601 --> 01:10:06,772
What'd you say to my sister, Percy Jones?

1135
01:10:08,089 --> 01:10:09,267
Nothing.

1136
01:10:09,496 --> 01:10:12,496
Listen, if you hear from her,
can you let me know?

1137
01:10:12,568 --> 01:10:16,661
Will do. And I look forward to seeing you
tomorrow at the party, right?

1138
01:10:16,730 --> 01:10:19,446
- Yeah, it should be a lot of fun.
- Goodbye.

1139
01:10:30,457 --> 01:10:31,535
Girl!

1140
01:10:32,727 --> 01:10:35,630
You will never guess
who was just on the phone!

1141
01:10:36,503 --> 01:10:39,088
- Who?
- A Mr. Percy A. Jones.

1142
01:10:39,543 --> 01:10:41,071
Percy A. Who?

1143
01:10:42,263 --> 01:10:45,132
Yeah, well, baby, he is feeling the pain now!

1144
01:10:46,647 --> 01:10:49,711
Mom. Is that gonna be your last one?

1145
01:10:49,781 --> 01:10:52,629
It might be, baby. And it might not.

1146
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:56,013
You should be over there
trying to work this out with Dad.

1147
01:10:56,087 --> 01:10:59,315
I should be over there trying to work it out
with Simon. Mom, please.

1148
01:10:59,381 --> 01:11:03,211
Child, leave your mom alone.
They ain't going nowhere.

1149
01:11:03,286 --> 01:11:06,002
Your man quit his job and didn't tell you.

1150
01:11:06,325 --> 01:11:08,627
- Got to nip that shit in the bud.
- Yes.

1151
01:11:08,821 --> 01:11:11,211
No. But... Look, I have 15 missed calls.

1152
01:11:11,605 --> 01:11:14,921
- Fifteen, Mom. Fifteen!
- Fifteen?

1153
01:11:14,997 --> 01:11:17,036
Your baby got 15 missed calls!

1154
01:11:17,109 --> 01:11:19,248
- Bullshit. Let him wait!
- That's true.

1155
01:11:19,316 --> 01:11:20,592
I'm gonna call him now.

1156
01:11:20,659 --> 01:11:24,041
- No, you're not!
- No. Don't you dare!

1157
01:11:24,116 --> 01:11:26,734
Child, you take your finger off that trigger!

1158
01:11:26,804 --> 01:11:29,739
Did he lie to you, Theresa?
Did he lie to you?

1159
01:11:29,812 --> 01:11:31,121
Yes, he did.

1160
01:11:31,475 --> 01:11:35,272
So, if you don't want him to do it again,
let him feel the pain!

1161
01:11:36,178 --> 01:11:39,954
Look, honey, and if you want him
that bad, you've got to train him.

1162
01:11:41,427 --> 01:11:44,077
My God, if what he's giving you
is that good...

1163
01:11:44,146 --> 01:11:47,691
and then you still don't want him,
send his pasty ass to me!

1164
01:11:51,698 --> 01:11:53,967
- All right, one more!
- Two!

1165
01:11:54,035 --> 01:11:55,692
There you go, baby!

1166
01:12:01,136 --> 01:12:02,796
Here's to you, baby.

1167
01:12:05,841 --> 01:12:08,775
I gotta go to work in the morning. Hello?

1168
01:12:09,585 --> 01:12:12,367
- Sorry, Marcus.
- I'm sorry, baby.

1169
01:12:14,289 --> 01:12:15,816
You want a taste?

1170
01:12:24,848 --> 01:12:26,442
Thank you, Marcus.

1171
01:12:28,399 --> 01:12:29,960
This is my house.

1172
01:12:52,878 --> 01:12:56,456
- She won't answer the phone.
- She don't want to talk to you.

1173
01:12:57,486 --> 01:12:59,754
- Can I get something to drink?
- What, vodka?

1174
01:12:59,822 --> 01:13:03,367
Yes. Vodka. I would like some vodka.

1175
01:13:03,725 --> 01:13:05,547
Sorry, Charlie. No vodka.

1176
01:13:05,613 --> 01:13:09,355
There's gotta be something around here.
Marilyn was throwing an anniversary party.

1177
01:13:09,422 --> 01:13:10,469
Is throwing a party.

1178
01:13:10,541 --> 01:13:11,784
- Was.
- Is.

1179
01:13:12,108 --> 01:13:14,247
- Party's off, dude.
- The party is on, dude.

1180
01:13:14,318 --> 01:13:17,613
You won't find no liquor in here.
This is a Christian home.

1181
01:13:17,677 --> 01:13:18,756
Bingo.

1182
01:13:22,027 --> 01:13:23,337
With a house full of sinners.

1183
01:13:23,404 --> 01:13:26,405
Marilyn's got good taste in vodka.
This is, like, a $50 bottle.

1184
01:13:26,477 --> 01:13:28,484
Give me that. Give it here.

1185
01:13:31,915 --> 01:13:34,435
- Can I at least have a little bit?
- No.

1186
01:13:35,242 --> 01:13:36,649
Just a taste.

1187
01:13:38,474 --> 01:13:42,272
Come around here and get those
two glasses over there. Hurry up.

1188
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:46,815
Who's playing?

1189
01:13:47,402 --> 01:13:49,769
Played. That's history.

1190
01:13:50,378 --> 01:13:52,614
New York Giants' first Super Bowl win.

1191
01:13:52,938 --> 01:13:55,076
Talking about Phil Simms. L.T.

1192
01:14:02,921 --> 01:14:04,351
You ever play?

1193
01:14:06,473 --> 01:14:09,342
- I told you before, no.
- Pitiful.

1194
01:14:18,377 --> 01:14:20,199
All right, let's do it.

1195
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:21,857
Do what?

1196
01:14:31,208 --> 01:14:34,851
- Fumble!
- You said you weren't gonna hit me!

1197
01:14:34,918 --> 01:14:37,570
Touchdown! Yeah, baby.

1198
01:14:38,631 --> 01:14:40,802
- This is where your hands go.
- Where am I gonna be?

1199
01:14:40,871 --> 01:14:43,172
- You're on the bottom. I'm on the top.
- All right.

1200
01:14:43,239 --> 01:14:45,377
Okay, so you hold this frame.

1201
01:14:45,734 --> 01:14:48,385
One and step. Right.

1202
01:14:48,454 --> 01:14:49,828
- I'm leading.
- Okay.

1203
01:14:49,894 --> 01:14:51,454
Back. Nice. Step.

1204
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:53,797
Left. Good. Double-time.

1205
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:58,691
- Okay, no. See? This is...
- What was wrong with that?

1206
01:14:58,757 --> 01:15:00,098
- You're screwing around.
- I'm not.

1207
01:15:00,165 --> 01:15:02,238
You're getting crazy here,
not holding your frame.

1208
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:04,960
There must be space between us.
Not like when we're sleeping.

1209
01:15:05,029 --> 01:15:06,174
You can't be, like, up here.

1210
01:15:06,245 --> 01:15:09,279
You're not holding your frame.
It's a structured dance.

1211
01:15:09,573 --> 01:15:12,060
- Okay, so back up.
- Your mama taught you this?

1212
01:15:12,133 --> 01:15:14,948
Yes, I used to help her in the dance studio
on the weekends.

1213
01:15:15,013 --> 01:15:17,118
- Step. Two.
- You get fired from there, too?

1214
01:15:17,189 --> 01:15:20,057
No. I didn't get fired from this job. I quit.

1215
01:15:21,347 --> 01:15:24,698
Was it over money? Because if it wasn't,
this doesn't make any sense.

1216
01:15:24,774 --> 01:15:27,555
I had a difference of opinion
with the management.

1217
01:15:27,621 --> 01:15:30,107
They weren't ready for a guy like me.

1218
01:15:32,227 --> 01:15:33,372
I don't get it.

1219
01:15:33,444 --> 01:15:35,417
And heads. No, you're doing great.

1220
01:15:35,491 --> 01:15:38,940
I ain't talking about this.
I'm talking about you and Theresa.

1221
01:15:39,012 --> 01:15:40,954
You ain't got nothing in common.

1222
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:42,881
For example:

1223
01:15:44,323 --> 01:15:47,138
You don't like sports. Theresa loves sports.

1224
01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:50,171
You're a businessman. She's an artist.

1225
01:15:50,658 --> 01:15:53,757
You're white. She's black.
Did I miss anything?

1226
01:15:55,010 --> 01:15:58,173
No. That's just it. She's everything I'm not.

1227
01:15:59,330 --> 01:16:02,810
You know, she's my other half.
Without her, I'm not whole.

1228
01:16:04,129 --> 01:16:06,747
You know, the thing
about meeting your other half is...

1229
01:16:06,816 --> 01:16:09,205
you're walking around,
you think you're happy...

1230
01:16:09,281 --> 01:16:10,458
you think that you're whole.

1231
01:16:10,528 --> 01:16:13,212
Then you realize you ain't shit without her.

1232
01:16:13,281 --> 01:16:15,003
Then you can't go back to being a half...

1233
01:16:15,073 --> 01:16:17,244
'cause now you know what it's like
to be a whole.

1234
01:16:17,313 --> 01:16:19,036
You know what I mean?

1235
01:16:19,871 --> 01:16:21,180
Yeah, I do.

1236
01:16:24,386 --> 01:16:26,043
And I still got it.

1237
01:16:26,336 --> 01:16:27,678
- That was nice.
- Real nice.

1238
01:16:27,744 --> 01:16:29,566
- I liked the snap.
- You like that?

1239
01:16:29,632 --> 01:16:31,290
- I think you hurt me.
- Percy Jones, boy.

1240
01:16:35,327 --> 01:16:36,734
Good morning.

1241
01:16:37,888 --> 01:16:40,058
Looks like I missed a fun night.

1242
01:16:40,127 --> 01:16:44,283
- Just sitting up here, watching football.
- That's how it always starts.

1243
01:16:45,086 --> 01:16:48,632
- Where's Marilyn?
- She stayed all night at Darlene's house.

1244
01:16:48,831 --> 01:16:50,488
She must be really mad.

1245
01:16:50,558 --> 01:16:53,079
Wait. You knew where they were
the whole time?

1246
01:16:53,182 --> 01:16:54,841
Yeah. I thought they'd be back by now.

1247
01:16:54,909 --> 01:16:56,982
- Did you apologize?
- I didn't do anything.

1248
01:16:57,053 --> 01:16:58,362
Exactly!

1249
01:16:58,685 --> 01:17:02,908
Dante, please. Don't try to play
that metrosexual mind game on me, okay?

1250
01:17:03,197 --> 01:17:04,888
Okay. All right.

1251
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:08,981
Let's go get them.

1252
01:17:10,205 --> 01:17:11,929
You don't understand.

1253
01:17:12,668 --> 01:17:16,411
They done called all their friends
and sat up all night ragging on men.

1254
01:17:16,477 --> 01:17:19,771
They've worked themselves up
into a man-hating frenzy.

1255
01:17:20,699 --> 01:17:23,735
- How many women?
- I guarantee you, large numbers.

1256
01:17:23,806 --> 01:17:24,983
Sisters.

1257
01:17:25,309 --> 01:17:29,269
You can't just walk in on a bunch
of angry black women. You'll die.

1258
01:17:30,075 --> 01:17:32,757
Well, we'll just have to go out like men.

1259
01:17:33,914 --> 01:17:36,403
- He's right, Percy.
- I know he's right.

1260
01:17:36,476 --> 01:17:38,200
But I'm still scared.

1261
01:17:38,492 --> 01:17:41,044
- Keep talking. What are you saying?
- Like that, a little.

1262
01:17:41,115 --> 01:17:42,903
- I'm liking it.
- Thank you.

1263
01:17:42,971 --> 01:17:45,009
You gonna share your colors?

1264
01:17:45,371 --> 01:17:47,475
You're one of them sisters
who don't share colors.

1265
01:17:47,547 --> 01:17:48,529
No, I'm not.

1266
01:17:48,603 --> 01:17:49,911
Give up your secrets, honey.

1267
01:17:49,977 --> 01:17:53,206
This is gorgeous. Pink Passion.
Every woman needs this.

1268
01:17:53,274 --> 01:17:54,550
A little Pink Passion?

1269
01:17:54,619 --> 01:17:55,828
You know what I always say?

1270
01:17:55,897 --> 01:17:59,510
A little bit of makeup, a little bit of hair
ain't never hurt nobody.

1271
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:02,097
How did I know
she would be wearing Pink Passion?

1272
01:18:07,706 --> 01:18:09,877
- Yes, they're in there.
- Maybe I should go first.

1273
01:18:09,945 --> 01:18:13,327
Are you crazy? I'm the one
that got experience in this sort of thing.

1274
01:18:13,401 --> 01:18:15,954
You just pay attention.
I'll show you how it's done.

1275
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:17,911
Here, straighten yourself up.

1276
01:18:17,976 --> 01:18:20,364
If you go up in there,
you go in looking like a man.

1277
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,415
- Wipe this off.
- You got something.

1278
01:18:22,488 --> 01:18:24,015
Thank you. Yeah.

1279
01:18:25,624 --> 01:18:28,885
- Man, I'm not gonna...
- No. We gotta do this.

1280
01:18:36,024 --> 01:18:37,779
Well, well, well.

1281
01:18:37,848 --> 01:18:40,497
- If it isn't Mr. Percy Jones.
- It is I.

1282
01:18:40,567 --> 01:18:42,160
It's about time you showed up.

1283
01:18:42,231 --> 01:18:43,953
- What's up?
- I'm well.

1284
01:18:47,319 --> 01:18:49,041
- Percy.
- Marilyn.

1285
01:18:50,775 --> 01:18:53,774
Marilyn, may I speak to you in private
over there, please...

1286
01:18:53,846 --> 01:18:55,635
so the ladies can continue eating?

1287
01:18:55,703 --> 01:18:57,524
Oh, no! You go on home with that.

1288
01:18:57,588 --> 01:19:00,938
- It's not going down like that, my brother.
- No way, no how.

1289
01:19:01,013 --> 01:19:04,722
You know better than that, Percy.
You got something to say, say it here.

1290
01:19:04,789 --> 01:19:06,284
In front of everybody.

1291
01:19:06,358 --> 01:19:09,075
Step up to the chalk line and be a man.

1292
01:19:12,917 --> 01:19:15,567
I married you, didn't I?
Don't that count for something?

1293
01:19:15,636 --> 01:19:17,546
- Hell, no!
- What does he want, an award?

1294
01:19:17,621 --> 01:19:18,994
That don't count for nothing!

1295
01:19:19,059 --> 01:19:20,467
It really doesn't count.

1296
01:19:20,532 --> 01:19:23,021
- Come on, man.
- I know, I'm just...

1297
01:19:29,011 --> 01:19:30,254
Oh, hell.

1298
01:19:30,322 --> 01:19:31,751
I was wrong, okay?

1299
01:19:31,827 --> 01:19:33,900
- It's a good start, Percy.
- Keep going!

1300
01:19:33,971 --> 01:19:36,209
I've been wrong for a long time.

1301
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:38,608
Ever since I forgot...

1302
01:19:40,179 --> 01:19:42,066
that you are my better half.

1303
01:19:42,450 --> 01:19:45,166
Hell, Marilyn, you're everything I'm not.

1304
01:19:46,675 --> 01:19:48,682
Without you, I'm not whole.

1305
01:19:50,323 --> 01:19:51,729
Look. Let...

1306
01:19:57,329 --> 01:19:59,948
Baby, before I met you,
I thought I was all that.

1307
01:20:00,018 --> 01:20:04,108
And then you came into my life,
and I realized that I wasn't all that.

1308
01:20:07,152 --> 01:20:09,062
Wasn't even half of that.

1309
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:11,598
I might have been a quarter of that.

1310
01:20:11,666 --> 01:20:13,290
But then you left me last night!

1311
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:16,393
And, baby, I remembered
how it felt to be without you.

1312
01:20:16,464 --> 01:20:19,846
And let me tell you something.
I ain't shit without you!

1313
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:21,319
- Dad.
- Man.

1314
01:20:21,392 --> 01:20:23,281
And I forgot about that.

1315
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:25,829
And I'm sorry.

1316
01:20:31,375 --> 01:20:32,869
Baby, marry me.

1317
01:20:34,031 --> 01:20:35,756
Make me whole again.

1318
01:20:35,824 --> 01:20:38,279
- I love you, Percy.
- I love you, too.

1319
01:20:39,279 --> 01:20:42,212
- That's what I'm talking about, baby.
- You go, Marilyn, bad girl!

1320
01:20:42,286 --> 01:20:43,748
Kiss your baby.

1321
01:20:43,823 --> 01:20:45,994
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you.

1322
01:20:46,062 --> 01:20:49,226
I couldn't sleep at all last night.
I'm sorry, baby.

1323
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:51,883
I feel so much better!

1324
01:20:51,982 --> 01:20:54,283
- Isn't that lovely?
- Get off that.

1325
01:21:03,437 --> 01:21:05,161
I guess it's my turn.

1326
01:21:06,957 --> 01:21:08,234
All right.

1327
01:21:09,582 --> 01:21:12,810
That's going to be a tough speech to follow.

1328
01:21:13,582 --> 01:21:15,947
- It was a great speech, Perce.
- Thank you.

1329
01:21:16,013 --> 01:21:20,037
- I had something similar in mind.
- Great minds think alike.

1330
01:21:20,108 --> 01:21:22,476
Admitting you were wrong
would be a great start.

1331
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:24,002
Yes, it would.

1332
01:21:25,484 --> 01:21:26,596
Right.

1333
01:21:28,811 --> 01:21:30,240
Go ahead, man.

1334
01:21:31,690 --> 01:21:33,284
Baby, I was wrong!

1335
01:21:34,604 --> 01:21:36,261
What are you doing?

1336
01:21:38,476 --> 01:21:41,606
I want to see your sexy body
go bump, bump, bump.

1337
01:21:41,834 --> 01:21:43,841
We have to talk in private.

1338
01:21:44,395 --> 01:21:46,598
I don't wanna hear it. No. Mom?

1339
01:21:48,266 --> 01:21:50,633
Just stay here and talk about it
in front of everybody!

1340
01:21:50,698 --> 01:21:52,160
Ladies, please.

1341
01:21:52,778 --> 01:21:55,266
Take your man
and go work out your business.

1342
01:21:55,338 --> 01:21:56,745
That's right.

1343
01:21:57,610 --> 01:21:58,755
Go on.

1344
01:21:59,914 --> 01:22:01,025
Thank you.

1345
01:22:01,097 --> 01:22:03,334
- Don't let him work on you.
- That ain't right.

1346
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:06,117
- Did he say "bump, bump, bump"?
- Yeah, and it's Percy's fault.

1347
01:22:06,185 --> 01:22:07,429
It's all your fault!

1348
01:22:07,497 --> 01:22:11,109
Those kids are in love and they finally
liked each other and you all interfere.

1349
01:22:11,178 --> 01:22:15,879
My love right here.
Don't tell me how to define my love!

1350
01:22:16,105 --> 01:22:17,664
Lord have mercy.

1351
01:22:22,664 --> 01:22:23,712
Baby.

1352
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:25,857
Come on.

1353
01:22:29,575 --> 01:22:31,581
I was trying to impress your father.

1354
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:34,656
I didn't want to show up here
and be the unemployed fiancé.

1355
01:22:34,728 --> 01:22:38,404
I've never lied to you before
and I'll never lie to you again, ever.

1356
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:41,252
You lied about asking my father for a loan.

1357
01:22:41,318 --> 01:22:44,516
That was an omission that was tied
to a previous lie. That doesn't...

1358
01:22:44,582 --> 01:22:46,306
And I look like an idiot to you.

1359
01:22:46,375 --> 01:22:50,269
No. You look a little bit
like Percy Jones, though.

1360
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:53,666
I can't believe you're trying to be funny.

1361
01:22:53,734 --> 01:22:56,800
- Baby, come on.
- Why do you have to be funny right now?

1362
01:22:56,870 --> 01:22:58,331
Don't touch me!

1363
01:23:00,006 --> 01:23:01,215
You need to calm down.

1364
01:23:01,285 --> 01:23:04,450
You made me look like an asshole in there.
Don't tell me to calm down.

1365
01:23:04,518 --> 01:23:07,038
I think you were doing
a pretty good job of that yourself.

1366
01:23:07,109 --> 01:23:09,083
Not telling them about me?

1367
01:23:09,349 --> 01:23:12,316
And then I pitched in and I blew it, okay?

1368
01:23:12,389 --> 01:23:15,040
I panicked when I found out
that Nathan was blackballing me.

1369
01:23:15,108 --> 01:23:18,905
I thought if I could score this IPO, I'd have
enough money until I got another job.

1370
01:23:18,981 --> 01:23:22,297
- But I was doing that for you.
- What am I, your mother?

1371
01:23:22,372 --> 01:23:23,932
I don't need you to take care of me.

1372
01:23:24,004 --> 01:23:26,753
I want you to do things with me,
not for me, Simon!

1373
01:23:26,819 --> 01:23:29,023
- Will you just talk to me?
- I am talking to you.

1374
01:23:29,219 --> 01:23:31,805
- You're talking at me.
- I am talking to you.

1375
01:23:31,875 --> 01:23:35,389
But you need to talk to me and tell me
how am I supposed to believe in you...

1376
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:37,663
when you don't trust me enough
to tell me the truth?

1377
01:23:37,731 --> 01:23:41,985
How do we get past this, with this skin,
if we don't have each other's back?

1378
01:23:42,051 --> 01:23:45,728
- Okay, I'm always gonna be the white boy.
- And I'll always be the black girl.

1379
01:23:45,795 --> 01:23:49,373
But at least I'm here and willing to deal
with it, and I don't know about you.

1380
01:23:49,443 --> 01:23:53,153
I don't know. And eventually, if you're
gonna quit on me, just do it and don't...

1381
01:23:53,218 --> 01:23:55,454
I'm standing right here!

1382
01:23:55,522 --> 01:23:58,621
What more do you want from me?
What do you want from the white boy?

1383
01:23:58,690 --> 01:24:00,959
I've been here busting my ass
to make you happy!

1384
01:24:01,025 --> 01:24:04,254
Then let me make this easy for you!
The engagement is off!

1385
01:24:04,418 --> 01:24:05,464
Fine.

1386
01:24:05,857 --> 01:24:07,231
- Good.
- Great.

1387
01:24:10,305 --> 01:24:11,418
Great.

1388
01:24:28,448 --> 01:24:30,203
I'm in Jersey!

1389
01:24:34,208 --> 01:24:36,957
- Okay, stand still now.
- I'm still.

1390
01:24:39,615 --> 01:24:41,044
You all right?

1391
01:24:43,327 --> 01:24:44,537
I'm fine.

1392
01:24:46,078 --> 01:24:48,949
I'm great. It's going to be a great day, Dad.

1393
01:24:49,023 --> 01:24:52,153
- It sure is.
- Yes. I'm gonna take lots of pictures.

1394
01:24:52,895 --> 01:24:55,742
- So you better smile big for me, okay?
- I will.

1395
01:24:55,806 --> 01:24:59,035
And no crying.
Mom said you cried last time.

1396
01:24:59,166 --> 01:25:01,587
I was not crying, I was sweating...

1397
01:25:01,821 --> 01:25:02,934
from my eyeballs.

1398
01:25:04,029 --> 01:25:06,811
Hell, I was nervous.
I knew I was making a big mistake.

1399
01:25:06,877 --> 01:25:08,471
A 25-year mistake.

1400
01:25:09,310 --> 01:25:11,098
And going for 25 more.

1401
01:25:13,724 --> 01:25:15,033
Sweetheart?

1402
01:25:15,548 --> 01:25:17,458
Why don't you call that man?

1403
01:25:17,533 --> 01:25:19,922
You know he got his cell phone on.
You know he does.

1404
01:25:19,997 --> 01:25:22,266
He's probably waiting on the 5:15 train.

1405
01:25:22,429 --> 01:25:25,178
We got a party going on.
You get his ass back here!

1406
01:25:25,244 --> 01:25:26,999
How many missed calls you have last night?

1407
01:25:27,067 --> 01:25:28,212
Thirty-three.

1408
01:25:28,283 --> 01:25:30,388
- Thirty-three?
- Yeah.

1409
01:25:30,715 --> 01:25:32,657
- Thirty-three?
- Yeah.

1410
01:25:32,861 --> 01:25:36,373
Thirty-three missed calls?
Sweetheart, that's major.

1411
01:25:37,083 --> 01:25:41,142
And you know the man is unemployed, yes,
but he calls you. So give him that.

1412
01:25:41,530 --> 01:25:44,847
Thirty-three missed calls?
And you can't call him once?

1413
01:25:46,043 --> 01:25:48,344
- Girl, don't be so proud.
- No. Daddy, it's not...

1414
01:25:48,411 --> 01:25:51,443
Pride ain't nothing
when it comes to matters of the heart.

1415
01:25:51,514 --> 01:25:52,942
It's not that.

1416
01:25:53,753 --> 01:25:55,827
- It's not?
- No.

1417
01:26:06,393 --> 01:26:10,005
- I was going to marry him.
- What?

1418
01:26:10,809 --> 01:26:14,104
We were going to announce
our engagement this weekend.

1419
01:26:22,584 --> 01:26:23,924
So, you see?

1420
01:26:24,504 --> 01:26:25,845
I have you to thank...

1421
01:26:25,912 --> 01:26:29,457
because you saved me from a big heartache.

1422
01:26:31,575 --> 01:26:34,292
Sweetheart, I just don't
understand something.

1423
01:26:34,359 --> 01:26:37,556
- Why did Simon quit his job?
- I don't know. He didn't say.

1424
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:41,651
Why would a man quit his job on the day
he's gonna meet his future father-in-law?

1425
01:26:41,718 --> 01:26:45,745
Maybe he got tired of waiting
for that promotion that never happened.

1426
01:26:47,032 --> 01:26:49,038
Simon's a rising star, Dad.

1427
01:26:50,422 --> 01:26:52,658
- He really is.
- I believe that.

1428
01:26:53,205 --> 01:26:56,053
But that boss of his is just not a nice man.

1429
01:26:56,534 --> 01:26:59,020
- You ever met him?
- A couple of times.

1430
01:26:59,574 --> 01:27:02,324
He was always friendly, kind of.

1431
01:27:03,094 --> 01:27:06,738
But he always had
this look in his eyes, you know?

1432
01:27:08,118 --> 01:27:09,807
Just not a nice man.

1433
01:27:10,677 --> 01:27:12,979
But he was Simon's mentor, so...

1434
01:27:14,132 --> 01:27:15,342
Whatever.

1435
01:27:16,277 --> 01:27:17,553
Let it go.

1436
01:27:18,486 --> 01:27:20,492
Today is about you and Mom.

1437
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:25,263
Now, first picture of the night.

1438
01:27:25,331 --> 01:27:27,786
- Let me get my... On my good side.
- Smile.

1439
01:27:29,876 --> 01:27:32,364
I don't want Mom to see me like this.

1440
01:27:34,452 --> 01:27:37,266
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you, too.

1441
01:28:01,297 --> 01:28:02,346
Damn!

1442
01:28:09,233 --> 01:28:10,443
No.

1443
01:28:10,513 --> 01:28:12,335
Do not do this to me, Percy Jones!

1444
01:28:12,401 --> 01:28:16,329
We have a schedule! Tick-tock.
Everything works. Timing.

1445
01:28:16,401 --> 01:28:17,514
I'll be right back.

1446
01:28:17,586 --> 01:28:19,439
- Timing!
- I'll be right back.

1447
01:28:19,538 --> 01:28:21,162
- In 10 minutes?
- Or so, okay?

1448
01:28:21,233 --> 01:28:22,377
How so?

1449
01:28:24,048 --> 01:28:26,916
I'm sorry.
Percy, have you met my wife, Diane?

1450
01:28:27,375 --> 01:28:29,928
I certainly have heard
a lot about you, Percy Jones.

1451
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,462
Nice to meet you.

1452
01:28:31,536 --> 01:28:34,351
- Does Marilyn know you're going AWOL?
- Of course.

1453
01:28:35,439 --> 01:28:37,261
She does not.

1454
01:29:48,682 --> 01:29:50,820
So you missed your train, huh?

1455
01:29:53,131 --> 01:29:56,196
- There's another one at 6:00.
- You gonna be on it?

1456
01:29:56,682 --> 01:29:58,885
I should have been on that one.

1457
01:30:02,506 --> 01:30:04,393
What are you doing here?

1458
01:30:04,682 --> 01:30:06,786
I know why you quit your job.

1459
01:30:07,241 --> 01:30:09,925
You told your boss you was coming here
to meet me and he said:

1460
01:30:09,992 --> 01:30:12,130
"Don't marry that black girl. "

1461
01:30:14,952 --> 01:30:17,190
Those weren't exactly the words.

1462
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:22,786
How did you know we were getting married?

1463
01:30:22,888 --> 01:30:26,051
I told you, son.
Don't nothing get past Percy Jones.

1464
01:30:26,247 --> 01:30:28,353
- Theresa told you.
- That, too.

1465
01:30:31,272 --> 01:30:32,995
Come on, man. Let's get real.

1466
01:30:33,065 --> 01:30:36,380
What you did with your boss
was honorable, impressive...

1467
01:30:37,287 --> 01:30:38,563
and stupid.

1468
01:30:38,632 --> 01:30:42,243
You can't quit your job every time
somebody rolls their eyes at the two of you.

1469
01:30:42,311 --> 01:30:44,352
You'll never make any money.

1470
01:30:51,718 --> 01:30:55,034
- How do you do 25 years?
- Painfully.

1471
01:30:57,957 --> 01:30:59,387
No, seriously.

1472
01:30:59,622 --> 01:31:03,200
If you're gonna marry one of these women,
sometimes it's gonna hurt like hell.

1473
01:31:03,270 --> 01:31:07,676
All you can do is admit that you're wrong
and know that she's always right.

1474
01:31:08,230 --> 01:31:09,723
- She's right?
- That's right.

1475
01:31:09,796 --> 01:31:11,041
- Always?
- Right.

1476
01:31:11,109 --> 01:31:12,319
- Right.
- That's right.

1477
01:31:12,388 --> 01:31:13,665
All right.

1478
01:31:14,213 --> 01:31:16,547
Okay, what about all the talk
about my dignity?

1479
01:31:16,614 --> 01:31:19,134
Do you love her? Do you want her?

1480
01:31:19,972 --> 01:31:21,860
Then she's always right.

1481
01:31:28,611 --> 01:31:31,427
Look, I know I didn't give you a fair shake.

1482
01:31:31,972 --> 01:31:33,499
And I was wrong.

1483
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:38,081
And my daughter,
she'd be lucky to have you.

1484
01:31:45,764 --> 01:31:47,868
I'm not a quitter, Mr. Jones.

1485
01:31:48,803 --> 01:31:50,941
I think I know that about you.

1486
01:31:51,587 --> 01:31:53,113
Theresa doesn't.

1487
01:31:54,563 --> 01:31:57,431
You just have to show her
what you're made of.

1488
01:31:57,601 --> 01:32:00,797
You know she's hot-headed.
She's just like her mama.

1489
01:32:04,611 --> 01:32:07,360
Every man gets to choose his destiny, son.

1490
01:32:08,992 --> 01:32:11,131
No matter what his father did.

1491
01:32:28,064 --> 01:32:30,302
And, Percy, you are not perfect.

1492
01:32:30,529 --> 01:32:33,789
But that works for me because
two perfect people in one relationship...

1493
01:32:33,855 --> 01:32:35,449
might be too much.

1494
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:39,325
And sometimes you bark
and bluff and bluster...

1495
01:32:39,391 --> 01:32:42,391
but I always see the boy I married
25 years ago.

1496
01:32:42,464 --> 01:32:46,457
And I only wish I loved him
as much as I did back then, but I don't.

1497
01:32:51,647 --> 01:32:53,173
I love him more.

1498
01:32:53,311 --> 01:32:55,415
Thank you, Marilyn. That was lovely.

1499
01:32:55,614 --> 01:32:57,588
Percy? Your vows?

1500
01:33:03,006 --> 01:33:04,436
Marilyn Jones.

1501
01:33:05,117 --> 01:33:07,637
Everyone knows I didn't write my vows.

1502
01:33:09,212 --> 01:33:12,212
Everyone knows because you kept
beating me up about it for weeks...

1503
01:33:12,284 --> 01:33:15,156
crying to all your friends. You know?

1504
01:33:15,774 --> 01:33:18,107
Now, look here, woman. I love you.

1505
01:33:19,325 --> 01:33:22,074
But you didn't have to do me like that
about my vows.

1506
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:25,008
You know I don't like writing.
She knows that.

1507
01:33:26,587 --> 01:33:28,279
I'm not a wordsmith.

1508
01:33:28,989 --> 01:33:31,891
I do numbers. That's me. I don't do words.

1509
01:33:32,635 --> 01:33:34,326
Damn it, I do money.

1510
01:33:35,387 --> 01:33:39,031
And after 25 years, all I've asked you...

1511
01:33:40,859 --> 01:33:42,518
is to let me be me.

1512
01:33:46,906 --> 01:33:49,142
You'll never find

1513
01:33:50,715 --> 01:33:52,755
As long as you shall live

1514
01:33:53,179 --> 01:33:54,455
Oh, Lord.

1515
01:33:54,682 --> 01:33:56,437
Someone to love you

1516
01:33:56,506 --> 01:33:58,230
Love you, love you

1517
01:33:58,299 --> 01:34:01,816
Tender like I do

1518
01:34:01,881 --> 01:34:03,541
You know that about me, woman.

1519
01:34:03,643 --> 01:34:05,878
You'll never find

1520
01:34:07,481 --> 01:34:09,521
No matter where you search

1521
01:34:09,593 --> 01:34:10,869
I'm not looking.

1522
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,888
Someone to care about you

1523
01:34:12,952 --> 01:34:14,448
Care about you, care about you

1524
01:34:14,522 --> 01:34:18,033
The way I do

1525
01:34:19,705 --> 01:34:22,901
Oh, I'm not bragging on myself, baby

1526
01:34:23,704 --> 01:34:27,731
But I'm the only one that loves you

1527
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:33,520
I think I forgot what love is
until you and Simon showed up.

1528
01:34:33,591 --> 01:34:36,177
Give that man another chance, daughter.

1529
01:34:36,727 --> 01:34:38,964
You'll never find

1530
01:34:41,335 --> 01:34:42,481
Simon!

1531
01:34:42,552 --> 01:34:44,079
Yes, Simon.

1532
01:34:44,728 --> 01:34:47,597
It'll take the end of all time

1533
01:34:48,374 --> 01:34:51,244
Someone who understands you

1534
01:34:52,503 --> 01:34:55,121
Like I do

1535
01:34:57,047 --> 01:34:58,606
That's not Jamal.

1536
01:35:04,630 --> 01:35:09,004
I could probably find a million reasons
why we shouldn't be together.

1537
01:35:09,461 --> 01:35:11,949
But you know what? I don't care.

1538
01:35:13,942 --> 01:35:15,665
I don't care, either.

1539
01:35:16,308 --> 01:35:17,650
I love you.

1540
01:35:17,940 --> 01:35:20,242
And I'm sorry that I lied to you.

1541
01:35:20,308 --> 01:35:21,616
I'm sorry, too.

1542
01:35:24,019 --> 01:35:25,427
You're sorry?

1543
01:35:26,996 --> 01:35:29,614
- Can you say that again?
- I'm sorry, Simon.

1544
01:35:29,684 --> 01:35:32,269
You're sorry? She said she was sorry.
I believe she's...

1545
01:35:32,339 --> 01:35:33,932
I'm sorry, Simon.

1546
01:35:35,763 --> 01:35:38,349
- Get your man, girl!
- Go ahead, sweetie!

1547
01:35:43,603 --> 01:35:45,806
Ladies and gentlemen,
it gives me great pleasure...

1548
01:35:45,874 --> 01:35:49,868
to introduce to you all
my future son-in-law, Simon Green.

1549
01:35:50,322 --> 01:35:53,550
He's broke, unemployed, and he's white.

1550
01:35:54,419 --> 01:35:57,169
But he loves my Theresa
and that's all right with us.

1551
01:35:57,234 --> 01:35:58,182
That's right.

1552
01:35:58,610 --> 01:36:01,676
Welcome to the family, son.
Welcome to the family.

1553
01:36:05,682 --> 01:36:07,306
And cue the magic.

1554
01:36:14,546 --> 01:36:15,592
Look at this.

1555
01:36:15,665 --> 01:36:17,672
Will you look at that shit?

1556
01:36:18,416 --> 01:36:20,587
Drink up! Enjoy!

1557
01:36:22,959 --> 01:36:24,366
Welcome, man.

1558
01:36:41,264 --> 01:36:43,336
- Let's watch the tango.
- No, let's watch the party.

1559
01:36:45,230 --> 01:36:48,459
- All right. Get your feet off the table.
- Sorry, sir.

1560
01:36:53,389 --> 01:36:56,686
- I look pretty good out there.
- You do, Mom.

1561
01:36:56,750 --> 01:37:00,459
Baby, you look so good
because you're twirling around me.

1562
01:37:00,526 --> 01:37:02,828
Oh, yeah, there you go, there you go.

1563
01:37:04,365 --> 01:37:05,926
All right, you blew that part.

1564
01:37:05,997 --> 01:37:08,266
- That was perfect.
- There was hesitation there.

1565
01:37:08,332 --> 01:37:10,701
- You did it better the night before.
- The night before?

1566
01:37:10,765 --> 01:37:13,548
- What happened?
- We had a little dry run the night before.

1567
01:37:13,614 --> 01:37:15,436
- Really?
- You didn't tell me that, Percy!

1568
01:37:15,502 --> 01:37:18,762
You're hallucinating, Simon.
I ain't never danced with no man in my life.

1569
01:37:18,828 --> 01:37:20,038
Taught him everything he knows.

1570
01:37:20,108 --> 01:37:22,279
Percy Jones was born
knowing how to tango.

1571
01:37:22,347 --> 01:37:24,617
And let me tell you something
about the tango.

1572
01:37:24,684 --> 01:37:27,435
- It's a structured dance.
- I told you that.

1573
01:37:32,365 --> 01:37:33,607
What was that, Mom?

1574
01:37:33,675 --> 01:37:36,905
You know what that is, Theresa.
You're a grown-ass woman.

1575
01:37:37,419 --> 01:37:40,069
- Damn, Mama, you still got it.
- I know it, Keisha.

1576
01:37:40,139 --> 01:37:42,529
All right now, watch this.
This is when I got funky.

1577
01:37:42,604 --> 01:37:46,792
- Go, Percy! It's your birthday!
- Go, Percy.

1578
01:37:48,651 --> 01:37:49,828
- Let's watch the vows.
- No!

1579
01:37:49,898 --> 01:37:52,831
- Watch the party.
- Okay, fine, whatever.

1580
01:37:55,243 --> 01:37:57,795
- There you are.
- I got her, that girl is mine!

1581
01:37:57,866 --> 01:38:00,550
I was just shocked you didn't fall down.

1582
01:38:00,618 --> 01:38:01,730
That is cold.

1583
01:38:01,803 --> 01:38:04,169
Look. Check me out. I am doing the hustle.

1584
01:38:04,234 --> 01:38:06,372
I'm doing the hustle in your honor,
Percy Jones.

1585
01:38:06,441 --> 01:38:08,993
That ain't no damn hustle.
That's the white man overbite.

1586
01:38:09,064 --> 01:38:12,064
- You ain't even doing that right.
- Why's it gotta be a white thing?

1587
01:38:12,137 --> 01:38:13,381
Blacks have overbites, too.

1588
01:38:13,449 --> 01:38:16,416
- He's doing a great hustle!
- He's turning it up.

1589
01:38:19,944 --> 01:38:22,147
- Why is my man looking at your ass?
- No, he's not.

1590
01:38:22,215 --> 01:38:24,004
Why is your man Samoan?

1591
01:38:24,071 --> 01:38:27,847
- Where is Manu these days?
- We broke up last week.

1592
01:38:27,912 --> 01:38:30,213
- Thank you, Jesus.
- What happened?

1593
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:32,767
I only started going out with him
to mess with Daddy.

1594
01:38:32,839 --> 01:38:36,255
And, girl, please. He is too big.
He is a bone crusher.

1595
01:38:36,327 --> 01:38:38,017
- Watch your mouth!
- What?

1596
01:38:38,087 --> 01:38:40,674
Do not use the word "bone" in my house.

1597
01:38:51,079 --> 01:38:53,980
- Where were you all going?
- Let's see that again.

1598
01:38:54,054 --> 01:38:56,772
Your mother and I
got a sudden thirst for punch.

1599
01:38:56,934 --> 01:38:58,397
No. You're old enough to know.

1600
01:38:58,470 --> 01:39:00,991
We going to shake some sheets.
Is that all right with you?

1601
01:39:01,063 --> 01:39:03,680
I thought you said no bone in the house!

1602
01:39:04,102 --> 01:39:05,117
No!

1603
01:39:05,189 --> 01:39:08,123
If everyone wants to see the lift,
we do the lift.

1604
01:39:08,196 --> 01:39:09,627
We're doing the lift!

1605
01:39:09,701 --> 01:39:11,391
This is good.

1606
01:39:11,461 --> 01:39:14,309
No. I was so sure
you were going to drop me there.

1607
01:39:14,822 --> 01:39:15,901
I love you!

1608
01:39:15,973 --> 01:39:18,820
This is Dirty Dancing.
I've been doing this since high school.

1609
01:39:18,884 --> 01:39:19,932
Look at that.

1610
01:39:20,005 --> 01:39:22,492
- Who's the man?
- You did it with other girls?

1611
01:39:22,563 --> 01:39:25,827
No, I only do that with you.

1612
01:39:29,124 --> 01:39:30,585
I know that hurt.

1613
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:33,855
See that move right there.
That's why you're not getting any grandkids.

1614
01:39:33,923 --> 01:39:37,720
Let me call your mama right now
and thank her for those dance lessons.

1615
01:39:37,795 --> 01:39:40,065
- That's a low blow.
- It's just a joke.

1616
01:39:40,355 --> 01:39:43,038
- Simon!
- Come on. I'll catch your big ass.

1617
01:39:47,171 --> 01:39:48,512
We're down!

1618
01:39:49,827 --> 01:39:51,997
Good thing is, she didn't break that dress.

1619
01:39:52,066 --> 01:39:54,817
No, she didn't,
but she felt bad about it all week.

1620
01:39:55,170 --> 01:39:56,828
They gotta go deep.

1621
01:39:56,930 --> 01:39:59,101
- I knew better.
- Oh, my God.

1622
01:39:59,169 --> 01:40:01,472
- That was a great party.
- It was, Mom.

1623
01:40:01,539 --> 01:40:04,636
Yeah, I guess a party not a party
till something get broke.
