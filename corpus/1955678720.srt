1
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,032
<i>And so, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

2
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:34,034
<i>we come to our final item,</i>

3
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:38,247
<i>a 1937 Bugatti
Type 57SC Atlantic,</i>

4
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,457
<i>one of only two in the world.</i>

5
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:43,460
<i>I could take the time to further
describe this absolute gem,</i>

6
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:44,878
<i>but you wouldn't be here today</i>

7
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,339
<i>if you hadn't been dreaming about
this car your entire life.</i>

8
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,258
<i>Bidding starts at $30 million.</i>

9
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,759
<i>$30 million, anybody?</i>

10
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,052
<i>Thank you, madam. $30 million.</i>

11
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,388
<i>Do I hear 32?</i>

12
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,057
<i>$32 million. Thank you, sir.</i>

13
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,392
<i>Thirty-four, anyone?</i>

14
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,102
<i>Thirty-four, on the telephone.</i>

15
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,480
<i>Thirty-six, anybody?
Thirty-six.</i>

16
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:06,275
<i>Thirty-six over there. Thirty-eight.
Do I have 38?</i>

17
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,317
<i>Thirty-seven, if you like.</i>

18
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,987
What do you think?
This is the one?

19
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,197
<i>Thirty-seven. Thank you, sir.</i>

20
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,323
<i>Thirty-seven over there.</i>

21
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,450
-Here.
-$38 million, on the telephone.

22
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,453
<i>Thirty-nine, in the room.
Thank you, sir.</i>

23
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,790
<i>$40 million. $40 million.</i>

24
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:24,543
<i>Going once, going twice...</i>

25
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:27,212
<i>Final call at $40 million...</i>

26
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,463
<i>$41 million.</i>

27
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,549
<i>$41 million, I have a bid.</i>

28
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,385
<i>Going once, going twice...</i>

29
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:36,096
<i>Sold for $41 million.</i>

30
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:39,016
<i>Congratulations.
The car is yours, sir.</i>

31
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,104
Come on.

32
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,106
Come on.

33
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,359
Come on, Gabriela.
Call me.

34
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,197
That phone's
not gonna ring.

35
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:54,239
You don't know that.

36
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,367
I'm on a bridge
in the South of France

37
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:00,162
instead of on a beach in
Brazil, counting our money,

38
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:01,580
because you fell
for the mark.

39
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,208
I didn't fall, okay?

40
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:09,046
If you look around, and you
don't know who the mark is,

41
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:10,422
then it's you.

42
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,549
That Ferrari
is not coming back.

43
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,302
You were played
by a very bad girl.

44
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:17,304
She'll call.

45
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,060
She'll call.

46
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,062
Can we focus, please?

47
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,605
I do love
the bad girls, though.

48
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:27,856
Focus.

49
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,566
All right, I heard
you the first time.

50
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:32,110
I bet you did,
with those big-ass ears.

51
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,113
There's nothing wrong with my ears.
I've got Dad's ears.

52
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,203
That's us.
You got this?

53
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,412
Yeah.
Do you?

54
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,207
You might need more
of a running start.

55
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:46,416
You're gonna tell me
how to do my job, now?

56
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,544
I'm just saying, one more step
might make all the difference.

57
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,586
Just drive.

58
00:03:40,385 --> 00:03:42,329
Seriously?

59
00:04:38,716 --> 00:04:40,087
Okay.

60
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:27,370
Hey, brother.

61
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:36,535
I should be driving.

62
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,666
You're flooding it, man.

63
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,984
Cutting the brakes?
Really?

64
00:06:09,026 --> 00:06:11,570
-That was your decision?
-I saved your ass back there.

65
00:06:11,612 --> 00:06:13,572
You should learn to be
kinder to your brother.

66
00:06:13,614 --> 00:06:14,615
-Half-brother.
-Yeah.

67
00:06:14,657 --> 00:06:17,284
We were trying not to draw
attention to ourselves.

68
00:06:17,326 --> 00:06:20,705
You know, I usually take your
general shit attitude towards me

69
00:06:20,746 --> 00:06:23,624
as a thinly-veiled cry for help,
but not today, brother,

70
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:27,712
because this beauty is our
first step to getting flush.

71
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:20,287
OVERDRIVE

72
00:07:20,288 --> 00:07:21,288
Subrip and Sync:
Pix

73
00:07:57,943 --> 00:08:00,638
-Look, I'm sorry. I didn't...
-Hi, Garrett.

74
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:11,828
You climbed out of our bed,
tip-toed over the floor,

75
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:14,044
and left me there
to steal that car.

76
00:08:14,045 --> 00:08:15,732
We are a team.

77
00:08:15,927 --> 00:08:18,058
You can't sideline me
on this one.

78
00:08:18,059 --> 00:08:19,898
Well, I tried to convince him,

79
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,548
but he wasn't having any of it.

80
00:08:22,827 --> 00:08:24,415
I'll give you a minute.

81
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,312
-Yeah.
-Steph...

82
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:29,489
You've got
to let me in, Andrew.

83
00:08:30,102 --> 00:08:31,789
All the way in.

84
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:35,302
Just tell me,
"You got it."

85
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:38,438
You got it.

86
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:50,883
Come on.

87
00:08:50,884 --> 00:08:52,221
Let's toast to Marseille.

88
00:08:52,222 --> 00:08:53,433
Damn right, baby.

89
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:56,109
Yeah, if jackass over here can
learn how to follow a plan.

90
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,843
Come on! Your plan was to
hang off the side of a truck.

91
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,937
If only your dad could
see you right now.

92
00:09:03,094 --> 00:09:04,347
Here we go.

93
00:09:04,348 --> 00:09:06,061
Did I ever tell you
about the time

94
00:09:06,062 --> 00:09:08,612
I changed the oil
on that '62 Ferrari?

95
00:09:08,613 --> 00:09:10,285
Terrible impression of Dad.

96
00:09:10,286 --> 00:09:14,299
Greatest goddamn day a grease
jockey like me ever had.

97
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,948
See, I heard the Ferrari
before I saw it.

98
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:18,940
Felt it shake
the floor of the garage.

99
00:09:18,941 --> 00:09:20,321
He's not gonna stop.

100
00:09:20,322 --> 00:09:23,665
The body was like that
of a... elegant woman.

101
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,296
The paint, a perfect red.
The oil...

102
00:09:25,297 --> 00:09:27,862
We've really got
to get him a girl.

103
00:09:28,976 --> 00:09:33,199
For a few hours, everything
felt right in the world.

104
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,065
And then, like a
vision, it was gone.

105
00:09:38,426 --> 00:09:41,744
Okay. Time for bed, old man.

106
00:09:42,274 --> 00:09:43,360
Fine.

107
00:09:43,361 --> 00:09:44,821
Bye.

108
00:09:44,822 --> 00:09:46,414
Hey.

109
00:09:46,683 --> 00:09:48,749
-Get some sleep. I'm serious.
-Yeah.

110
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,701
We've got a car
to fence in the morning.

111
00:09:49,702 --> 00:09:53,196
Yeah, you're right.
We should call it a night.

112
00:09:54,085 --> 00:09:55,678
Or...

113
00:09:58,924 --> 00:10:04,899
So, what was that you were
saying about "all the way in"?

114
00:10:22,453 --> 00:10:24,252
Beautiful.

115
00:10:26,712 --> 00:10:28,613
You have delivered the dream.

116
00:10:28,614 --> 00:10:31,241
That's the Foster guarantee.

117
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,737
When I told you
I wanted this car,

118
00:10:39,738 --> 00:10:43,192
I didn't say I wanted it
stolen from a madman.

119
00:10:44,038 --> 00:10:45,838
Let's be clear about that.

120
00:10:46,644 --> 00:10:49,455
Well, we don't ask you
where you get your money.

121
00:10:49,456 --> 00:10:51,563
Don't ask us
where we get our cars.

122
00:10:51,564 --> 00:10:55,969
But sometimes, you upset the
wrong guy and you find trouble.

123
00:10:56,444 --> 00:10:59,029
Well, then don't upset us.

124
00:10:59,438 --> 00:11:03,051
Look. Come on, now, all right?
This is just business.

125
00:11:03,052 --> 00:11:07,176
You ordered a classic, Mr. Panahi,
and we delivered on time.

126
00:11:07,857 --> 00:11:10,789
If you just pay us,
we'll be on our way.

127
00:11:49,812 --> 00:11:52,829
I swear,

128
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,901
I had no idea
who the car belonged to.

129
00:11:56,902 --> 00:11:58,990
I would never have...

130
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,674
Do you know who I am?

131
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:22,002
Nope, but I'm pretty sure

132
00:12:22,003 --> 00:12:26,365
the last time a guy wearing
an ascot got laid was 1972.

133
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:40,038
So you're brothers?

134
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:42,441
Yeah, he's my brother
from another mother.

135
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:45,388
Literally. Look.

136
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,289
Never mind.

137
00:12:47,455 --> 00:12:51,011
Would you like
to know who I am?

138
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:56,181
If you look to the west, just
where the lake meets the shore...

139
00:12:57,442 --> 00:12:59,324
Right at the tip,
you see?

140
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,748
About 200 meters from there
is where I was born.

141
00:13:04,637 --> 00:13:08,049
The house I lived in was no
bigger than a storage shed.

142
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:10,343
My mother worked
for a fishmonger,

143
00:13:10,344 --> 00:13:14,914
cleaning up scales and blood and
gills until her fingers went raw.

144
00:13:15,182 --> 00:13:18,180
She was stooped over
as long as I ever knew her.

145
00:13:19,524 --> 00:13:24,094
I didn't want to hug her,
the way she smelled.

146
00:13:25,768 --> 00:13:30,048
Can you imagine not wanting
to hug your own mother?

147
00:13:32,715 --> 00:13:36,229
My father worked for a man who
restored antique hunting rifles

148
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,008
until the day he died.

149
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:39,992
I learned all about underlever,

150
00:13:39,993 --> 00:13:42,743
exposed hammers,
Whelen barrels,

151
00:13:43,012 --> 00:13:46,713
express sights
before I could walk.

152
00:13:47,478 --> 00:13:51,860
When he died, I started stealing
wallets from the sailors in Marseille.

153
00:13:51,861 --> 00:13:53,867
Made quite a living.

154
00:13:54,012 --> 00:13:56,555
Kept expanding my operation.

155
00:13:56,576 --> 00:14:00,483
And now, I'm the biggest black-tar
importer in southern Europe.

156
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,668
And a collector
of all that is rare.

157
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,811
And beautiful.

158
00:14:16,094 --> 00:14:17,728
Untie them.

159
00:14:19,816 --> 00:14:22,607
I wanna show you
more beauties.

160
00:14:47,191 --> 00:14:50,043
Is that the Alfa Romeo 158?

161
00:14:50,044 --> 00:14:52,987
Yes, it was driven
by Juan Manuel Fangio.

162
00:14:52,988 --> 00:14:56,739
This car finished first in the
1950 Monte Carlo Grand Prix?

163
00:14:56,886 --> 00:14:58,481
Perceptive.

164
00:14:59,872 --> 00:15:01,902
Dodge 6 with
right-handed steering?

165
00:15:01,903 --> 00:15:04,100
It was altered
for Al Capone himself.

166
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:06,048
Very convenient
for a drive-by.

167
00:15:06,049 --> 00:15:08,515
Corvette C1.

168
00:15:08,911 --> 00:15:11,024
'64 Shelby Cobra.

169
00:15:11,025 --> 00:15:13,491
You got an Austin-Healey,

170
00:15:13,804 --> 00:15:15,586
a Jaguar Type-E,

171
00:15:15,587 --> 00:15:18,779
and, a BMW 327,

172
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,935
and an Aston Martin!

173
00:15:20,936 --> 00:15:22,303
-'70?
-'69.

174
00:15:22,304 --> 00:15:24,480
'67 Mustang.

175
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,258
Porsche 356.

176
00:15:27,737 --> 00:15:29,311
Jaguar XK120.

177
00:15:29,312 --> 00:15:31,239
Exactly right.

178
00:15:31,883 --> 00:15:33,519
Right.

179
00:15:34,827 --> 00:15:38,040
-You're...
-Jacomo Morier.

180
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,445
Dear.

181
00:15:40,466 --> 00:15:42,145
Yeah.

182
00:15:42,747 --> 00:15:46,166
Entirety of my life has been
invested in these cars.

183
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:48,220
They're a constant reminder
of how far I've come

184
00:15:48,221 --> 00:15:50,479
and how far I intend to go.

185
00:15:51,497 --> 00:15:53,900
That motherless freak
Panahi thieved from me,

186
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:55,807
which means
you thieved from me.

187
00:15:55,808 --> 00:15:59,167
Mr. Morier, we had no
idea this was your car.

188
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:00,576
We just thought it was
purchased at auction

189
00:16:00,577 --> 00:16:02,359
and passing
through Marseille.

190
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,728
Ignorance of a crime
against a man

191
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,883
is no excuse
for the crime itself.

192
00:16:05,884 --> 00:16:07,667
Wait, wait, wait.

193
00:16:07,668 --> 00:16:09,617
Look, Mr. Morier, maybe there's
something we can do for you,

194
00:16:09,618 --> 00:16:10,570
-you know?
-Garrett...

195
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:11,441
Make things square.
He's gonna shoot us.

196
00:16:11,442 --> 00:16:14,115
-You're not helping.
-Max Klemp.

197
00:16:15,712 --> 00:16:18,178
-Max Klemp?
-Max Klemp.

198
00:16:19,817 --> 00:16:22,595
Look, either we cut him in,
or there's nothing to cut.

199
00:16:22,596 --> 00:16:24,191
Cut me into what?

200
00:16:27,364 --> 00:16:30,120
Okay. Max Klemp.

201
00:16:30,972 --> 00:16:35,179
Max Klemp was a third-generation
heavy out of West Berlin.

202
00:16:35,657 --> 00:16:38,289
<i>Born with a silver spoon
in his mouth.</i>

203
00:16:45,941 --> 00:16:48,677
<i>Turns out he was the
smart one in the family</i>

204
00:16:48,678 --> 00:16:53,445
<i>because at age 15, he started his
MBA at the University of Munich,</i>

205
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,602
<i>seven years younger
than any other student.</i>

206
00:16:55,603 --> 00:16:59,831
<i>At age 20, he proved himself not
only brilliant with numbers</i>

207
00:16:59,832 --> 00:17:02,277
<i>but capable of taking over
the family business</i>

208
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:05,159
<i>in his own unique way.</i>

209
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:24,068
<i>At age 30, his father handed
him the reins to the empire,</i>

210
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:30,080
<i>and to celebrate the event,
he gave him a gift.</i>

211
00:17:33,129 --> 00:17:37,007
<i>A 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO,</i>

212
00:17:37,008 --> 00:17:40,986
<i>today worth roughly $38 million.</i>

213
00:17:48,336 --> 00:17:53,185
We were gonna steal it from
them here in Marseille.

214
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:58,017
It's our plan.

215
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,933
You know him?

216
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:03,890
Klemp.

217
00:18:04,582 --> 00:18:07,682
I know the bastard better
than he knows himself.

218
00:18:08,248 --> 00:18:10,455
He crossed me on an important
real estate deal in Berlin,

219
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,871
which cost me dearly.

220
00:18:11,872 --> 00:18:14,329
He took Torino,
Naples, Monaco,

221
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,328
and then he decided to take
something else from me,

222
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:20,577
something priceless.

223
00:18:20,578 --> 00:18:23,576
Marseille.
But Marseille is mine.

224
00:18:23,577 --> 00:18:26,969
Well, sounds as if you
don't like him very much.

225
00:18:31,617 --> 00:18:36,573
So, you say you're going
to steal that '62 Ferrari

226
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:39,406
right out of his compound.

227
00:18:39,407 --> 00:18:40,447
That is impossible.

228
00:18:40,448 --> 00:18:42,173
You let us go,

229
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,672
and we can bring you Max Klemp's
most prized possession.

230
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:58,128
Look, it's not just a car,
Mr. Morier.

231
00:18:59,528 --> 00:19:01,752
It's his legacy.

232
00:19:04,318 --> 00:19:05,918
What do you say?

233
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,958
You have one week.

234
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:14,856
A week? We're gonna
need longer than that.

235
00:19:14,857 --> 00:19:16,748
Drop them back in Marseille.

236
00:19:27,146 --> 00:19:29,894
We've never planned a job
inside a week before.

237
00:19:29,895 --> 00:19:32,394
We're in Marseille.
We can't crew up that fast.

238
00:19:32,395 --> 00:19:34,994
-Shit.
-What?

239
00:19:37,393 --> 00:19:39,201
What's that?

240
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:40,433
I'm gonna ask
Steph to marry me.

241
00:19:40,434 --> 00:19:42,076
Now?

242
00:19:42,184 --> 00:19:43,909
-Yeah.
-Really?

243
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,265
That's great.
I'm happy for you.

244
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:50,032
I mean, she deserves
better, but still.

245
00:19:50,224 --> 00:19:52,181
I'm taking the piss,
all right?

246
00:19:52,182 --> 00:19:54,031
I want the best
for you, brother.

247
00:19:54,431 --> 00:19:55,555
So you're okay with this?

248
00:19:55,556 --> 00:19:57,197
Of course.

249
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,178
-It's just...
-Here we go.

250
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:04,385
It's a genuine concern.

251
00:20:04,386 --> 00:20:08,302
You get married. You have a kid.
The whole thing goes tits-up.

252
00:20:08,303 --> 00:20:09,510
And I'm left holding the bag.

253
00:20:09,511 --> 00:20:10,842
We can't do this forever.

254
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,985
But we can't stop
in our prime.

255
00:20:13,384 --> 00:20:15,734
I'm sure Stephanie
would agree with me.

256
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,383
What did Dad say to us
when he brought us together?

257
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,465
"You missed the first 15 years of being
friends. Don't miss the next 50."

258
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:24,899
So let's get back on our feet

259
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:26,506
and do what we do best.

260
00:20:26,507 --> 00:20:29,776
Garrett, after this job,
I'm done.

261
00:20:30,075 --> 00:20:31,752
You're joking.

262
00:20:34,464 --> 00:20:37,011
When were you thinking
of telling me?

263
00:20:37,115 --> 00:20:38,873
Just did.

264
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,737
-Where have you been?
-Honey, just...

265
00:21:00,923 --> 00:21:04,339
-You scared the hell out of me.
-Could really get used to this.

266
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,843
I called you all day.
You didn't answer the phone.

267
00:21:06,844 --> 00:21:09,349
Why are you wet?

268
00:21:09,784 --> 00:21:11,792
We had a slight problem.

269
00:21:12,889 --> 00:21:14,214
What kind of problem?

270
00:21:14,215 --> 00:21:16,338
The kind where people
are shot off roofs.

271
00:21:16,339 --> 00:21:18,706
What?

272
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,571
-Shot off roofs?
-I'm fine.

273
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,432
But this is why I don't
want you in on this one.

274
00:21:23,433 --> 00:21:26,684
There's always a risk
involved, Andrew.

275
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:30,230
-That's part of the job.
-There's a place for her, Andrew.

276
00:21:30,231 --> 00:21:32,914
Out of the question.
Not with these guys.

277
00:21:32,915 --> 00:21:36,178
Sweet. It's like my own
private telenovela.

278
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:39,282
You didn't tell her
we've only got one week.

279
00:21:39,283 --> 00:21:41,016
This is why you need me.

280
00:21:41,017 --> 00:21:43,188
Plus, we're gonna need a crew if we're
gonna pull off a job like this.

281
00:21:43,189 --> 00:21:45,109
Exactly what I thought.

282
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,812
I got a friend here
in Marseille.

283
00:21:47,813 --> 00:21:49,826
She can help us get
the people we need.

284
00:21:49,827 --> 00:21:52,245
-What?
-Relax.

285
00:21:52,246 --> 00:21:55,847
She's great. She taught me lot.
She's a fisherman.

286
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,887
No, I said "crew," Steph.

287
00:21:58,888 --> 00:22:02,473
I'm not sure a fisherman is
exactly what we're looking for.

288
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:06,240
That's 'cause I haven't told
you what she fishes for.

289
00:22:06,334 --> 00:22:08,290
<i>And how do you know
this friend, exactly?</i>

290
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:11,602
<i>Let's just say that neither of
us are welcome in any casino</i>

291
00:22:11,603 --> 00:22:13,280
<i>this side of Amsterdam.</i>

292
00:22:22,534 --> 00:22:24,521
Yeah, we don't
speak French. Sorry.

293
00:22:24,522 --> 00:22:26,592
-Okay. You can pole me.
-I don't want...

294
00:22:26,593 --> 00:22:28,330
Then come... Hey!

295
00:22:28,331 --> 00:22:31,332
Check your valuables, sir.
This woman is a known thief.

296
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:33,817
No, I'm okay.

297
00:22:38,517 --> 00:22:40,897
Here she comes.

298
00:22:42,617 --> 00:22:44,230
She's single.

299
00:22:44,231 --> 00:22:45,597
She's a thief.

300
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:47,316
We're thieves, smart guy.

301
00:22:50,566 --> 00:22:52,429
Devin!

302
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,106
So good to see you.

303
00:22:57,399 --> 00:22:59,386
-So, this is Andrew.
-Hi.

304
00:22:59,387 --> 00:23:01,932
-And this is Garrett.
-Hello.

305
00:23:02,408 --> 00:23:05,079
You having a little trouble
with the police?

306
00:23:05,513 --> 00:23:07,107
No trouble.

307
00:23:09,116 --> 00:23:10,834
Hey!

308
00:23:12,139 --> 00:23:14,140
<i>Merde!
Call me.</i>

309
00:23:14,141 --> 00:23:15,913
Get back here!

310
00:23:16,108 --> 00:23:17,798
-Stop!
-Get back here!

311
00:23:20,588 --> 00:23:22,429
It's not bad.

312
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:24,161
She's in.

313
00:23:29,548 --> 00:23:31,137
So the bump is important,

314
00:23:31,138 --> 00:23:33,525
but the misdirection of
the target is the key.

315
00:23:33,526 --> 00:23:36,622
And now you can rob
poor tourists together.

316
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,731
Stop.

317
00:23:39,429 --> 00:23:41,688
Get them thinking about one
thing before you bump them.

318
00:23:41,689 --> 00:23:45,624
Like, say, "Excuse me,
do you have the time?"

319
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:46,587
No, you don't.

320
00:23:46,588 --> 00:23:49,434
Would another good example
of a misdirect be

321
00:23:49,435 --> 00:23:51,276
to get someone
to fall in love with you,

322
00:23:51,277 --> 00:23:54,222
steal their stuff, and then
leave while they're asleep?

323
00:23:55,506 --> 00:23:56,678
Brazil, Brazil.

324
00:23:56,679 --> 00:23:59,204
Yeah, that would
work really well.

325
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:20,430
Leon.

326
00:24:21,631 --> 00:24:23,361
Leon.

327
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:30,463
What did you
bring me, you thief?

328
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,553
<i>C'est un croissant.</i>

329
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:33,242
Your favorite.

330
00:24:33,897 --> 00:24:35,530
First, you have
to prove to my friends

331
00:24:35,531 --> 00:24:37,303
how good you are
at blowing things up.

332
00:24:44,574 --> 00:24:46,666
Open the safe
without harming the pastries,

333
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:48,314
and they're yours.

334
00:24:54,246 --> 00:24:56,310
All right,
get out of the way.

335
00:25:09,652 --> 00:25:11,257
Should we...

336
00:25:19,073 --> 00:25:20,788
I promise, he's good.

337
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:22,086
I just got him
a little excited. It was...

338
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,692
He's in.

339
00:25:24,138 --> 00:25:27,334
-He's in?
-Yup. We don't have time to be picky.

340
00:25:41,262 --> 00:25:43,228
Not this time. No.

341
00:25:43,229 --> 00:25:45,197
I wanna focus on the job.

342
00:25:45,198 --> 00:25:47,849
-You sure about that?
-Yes.

343
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:50,822
Yes.

344
00:25:52,022 --> 00:25:53,528
Anyway, I think we
should be more concerned

345
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:56,558
about how we're gonna work
this from the inside.

346
00:25:56,837 --> 00:25:58,735
I wanna do that.

347
00:25:59,223 --> 00:26:01,749
I'm the last one
anyone would expect.

348
00:26:02,154 --> 00:26:03,884
Steph...

349
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,480
What?

350
00:26:07,219 --> 00:26:10,062
Can I talk to you for a sec?

351
00:26:21,412 --> 00:26:24,132
What's the matter with you?

352
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:26,017
How many times are we gonna
have the same fight?

353
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:28,445
I'm just trying
to keep you safe.

354
00:26:28,446 --> 00:26:30,161
So let me get this straight.

355
00:26:30,162 --> 00:26:32,297
You've risked my life in the
past, but now you won't.

356
00:26:32,298 --> 00:26:33,386
-Yeah.
-Is that it?

357
00:26:33,387 --> 00:26:35,060
-Yes, that's right.
-Why?

358
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:36,400
Because we're together now?

359
00:26:36,401 --> 00:26:38,452
-I haven't changed.
-I have.

360
00:26:38,453 --> 00:26:40,461
You know I can handle it.

361
00:26:40,462 --> 00:26:43,030
Andrew, shutting me out

362
00:26:43,225 --> 00:26:47,844
and trying to protect me like one
of those cars, it won't work.

363
00:26:50,301 --> 00:26:53,524
I know you're afraid to lose me,
but this is the life we chose.

364
00:26:53,525 --> 00:26:55,841
Don't you see that?

365
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:21,407
So, tell me, what
happened in Brazil?

366
00:27:21,408 --> 00:27:22,998
-It doesn't matter.
-I'd like to know.

367
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:26,279
-No. No, please. Allow me.
-Andrew.

368
00:27:26,516 --> 00:27:28,357
You see, we were
finishing a job.

369
00:27:28,358 --> 00:27:31,829
-Don't.
-'61 California Spider. It was beautiful.

370
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:35,080
We had the car, and the night we
negotiate the deal with the buyers,

371
00:27:35,081 --> 00:27:38,389
Gabriela lets
little Garrett hit it.

372
00:27:39,122 --> 00:27:44,306
The next morning, Gabriela's
gone, and so is the Ferrari.

373
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:46,539
Oof! Screwed two times.

374
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,664
Not quite.

375
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:51,081
Actually,
while I was recovering,

376
00:27:51,082 --> 00:27:52,790
Andrew saw
the car leave at dawn.

377
00:27:52,791 --> 00:27:54,581
He could have chased it.
I know I would have.

378
00:27:54,582 --> 00:27:55,623
The road was blocked.

379
00:27:55,624 --> 00:27:57,748
Which is why you should
have done the Riviera Run.

380
00:27:57,749 --> 00:27:58,623
-What?
-Yeah.

381
00:27:58,624 --> 00:28:01,331
-What, did you just make that up?
-Yup.

382
00:28:01,332 --> 00:28:02,790
It's catchy.

383
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:04,831
-What's that?
-Riviera Run?

384
00:28:04,832 --> 00:28:06,290
Okay.

385
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:08,706
So you're holding the throttle while
mashing the brake at the same time.

386
00:28:08,707 --> 00:28:10,457
It's not as easy
as it sounds, okay?

387
00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:11,666
Too much pressure,
and the engine stalls.

388
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:13,541
Too little,
and you lose speed.

389
00:28:13,542 --> 00:28:15,434
And then,
when you let it go...

390
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:18,625
Riviera Run.

391
00:28:18,626 --> 00:28:20,415
That doesn't actually work.

392
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:21,666
Yes, it does.
You didn't try it.

393
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:23,308
You weren't there.

394
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:27,392
Stop.

395
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:31,124
So that's it?

396
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:34,059
You don't get involved with
girls on jobs anymore?

397
00:28:36,626 --> 00:28:38,626
I think you should
dance with me.

398
00:28:38,627 --> 00:28:42,351
Yeah? Only if you give
me my phone back first.

399
00:28:44,793 --> 00:28:47,018
It's not gonna ring.

400
00:29:32,796 --> 00:29:34,396
They're good.

401
00:29:41,755 --> 00:29:42,797
Really good.

402
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:44,397
Meh.

403
00:29:46,089 --> 00:29:48,897
You have friends that
can drive like that?

404
00:29:49,797 --> 00:29:51,397
So what's your plan?

405
00:29:51,797 --> 00:29:53,464
Don't need one.

406
00:29:53,465 --> 00:29:55,439
Got to be able to adapt.

407
00:29:55,506 --> 00:29:57,464
-Just start low.
-Yeah, I know what to do.

408
00:29:57,465 --> 00:29:58,631
Garrett, let me
help you with this.

409
00:29:58,632 --> 00:29:59,588
-These people...
-No, thanks.

410
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:02,273
Fair, but firm.
That's what I always do.

411
00:30:02,423 --> 00:30:04,630
I don't steal from people
who don't have it coming.

412
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:06,398
Fine. Be my guest.

413
00:30:08,548 --> 00:30:10,398
Who wants bouillabaisse?

414
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:15,940
I'm buying.

415
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:21,982
We're prepared to pay you each 1,000
euros for your driving services.

416
00:30:26,674 --> 00:30:28,274
All right, then.

417
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,150
You know the way out.

418
00:30:34,091 --> 00:30:36,633
Look, you guys need to counter.
That's how this works.

419
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:39,233
Otherwise, I don't know
where your heads are, so...

420
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:44,442
Okay, then. Just a little
bit of help, please.

421
00:30:47,426 --> 00:30:50,234
Five grand.
It's my final offer.

422
00:30:54,676 --> 00:30:56,318
What?

423
00:31:01,135 --> 00:31:02,211
They don't speak English?

424
00:31:02,212 --> 00:31:04,574
I tried to tell you, but...

425
00:31:05,286 --> 00:31:06,556
You knew about this,
didn't you?

426
00:31:06,557 --> 00:31:08,196
No.

427
00:31:08,197 --> 00:31:10,519
You're a wanker.

428
00:31:11,404 --> 00:31:14,151
Five grand.
We're good, then.

429
00:31:21,233 --> 00:31:23,500
That's women for you!

430
00:31:23,501 --> 00:31:24,893
Who's that?

431
00:31:24,894 --> 00:31:27,258
Hey, who are you?

432
00:31:27,259 --> 00:31:30,291
You're gonna swing
that thing? Go ahead.

433
00:31:30,292 --> 00:31:34,115
Except I understand you wanna
get in with Max Klemp.

434
00:31:36,017 --> 00:31:38,281
I can help with that.

435
00:31:39,054 --> 00:31:41,570
Hey, I asked you a question.

436
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:43,467
My name is Laurent.

437
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:45,964
-Well, this was lovely, Laurent.
-Morier.

438
00:31:45,965 --> 00:31:47,712
Laurent Morier.

439
00:31:47,713 --> 00:31:50,603
I'm Jacomo Morier's
first cousin.

440
00:31:50,877 --> 00:31:53,913
I believe you had a nice day
of skeet shooting with him.

441
00:31:53,914 --> 00:31:55,288
He asked me
to join up with you.

442
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:57,553
Help you with whatever
you have planned.

443
00:31:57,785 --> 00:32:00,783
So, you mean, spy on us
and report back to him.

444
00:32:00,784 --> 00:32:02,214
Exactly.

445
00:32:02,947 --> 00:32:05,818
Let me ask you,
who is your contact

446
00:32:05,819 --> 00:32:08,292
inside Max Klemp's organization?

447
00:32:09,233 --> 00:32:10,938
I'll tell you.

448
00:32:10,939 --> 00:32:12,228
It's me.

449
00:32:12,229 --> 00:32:14,286
How?

450
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:17,284
I know a guy
who knows a guy.

451
00:32:20,554 --> 00:32:22,592
<i>The guy I know is Kuhn.</i>

452
00:32:22,593 --> 00:32:25,191
<i>Does dirty work for Klemp</i>

453
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:28,272
<i>but he cannot ignore
an easy score.</i>

454
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,262
Mr. Kuhn.

455
00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:47,942
What the hell do you want,
Laurent Morier?

456
00:32:47,943 --> 00:32:50,190
I have a business proposition
you might be interested in.

457
00:32:50,191 --> 00:32:53,644
And what's your cousin
think of you being here?

458
00:32:53,645 --> 00:32:56,493
What my cousin doesn't know is
what my cousin doesn't know.

459
00:32:57,724 --> 00:33:00,179
-What are your names?
-Foster.

460
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,510
I'm Garrett, and this is
my brother, Andrew.

461
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:04,217
That's cute.
Who's in charge?

462
00:33:04,218 --> 00:33:06,233
I am.

463
00:33:06,715 --> 00:33:08,439
I got this one, boys.

464
00:33:08,755 --> 00:33:11,395
Okay, here's the deal.

465
00:33:11,627 --> 00:33:14,707
These guys are the two best
drivers in the business.

466
00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:16,871
We can steal anything
with an engine.

467
00:33:16,872 --> 00:33:19,660
Armored trucks,
high-end delivery vans...

468
00:33:19,661 --> 00:33:22,425
-Why don't we just show you?
-Wait.

469
00:33:22,616 --> 00:33:27,044
If we pull a job for you,
we get an introduction.

470
00:33:27,485 --> 00:33:29,959
-To whom?
-Max Klemp.

471
00:33:30,774 --> 00:33:32,166
I don't know Max Klemp.

472
00:33:32,167 --> 00:33:34,027
Come on.

473
00:33:34,225 --> 00:33:36,168
Well, that's too bad.

474
00:33:41,321 --> 00:33:43,097
Wait.

475
00:33:56,607 --> 00:33:58,383
Here. Hold that.

476
00:34:06,602 --> 00:34:09,092
Now he's just showing off.

477
00:34:11,642 --> 00:34:13,459
Get back in here.

478
00:34:17,521 --> 00:34:19,212
Are you done yet?

479
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,383
Good.

480
00:34:30,708 --> 00:34:33,940
But enough games.
Take a look out there.

481
00:34:33,941 --> 00:34:36,375
See that cargo plane?

482
00:34:36,376 --> 00:34:39,706
It's a vehicle
with an engine, right?

483
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:41,078
I want you to stop it.

484
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,585
Now.

485
00:34:42,586 --> 00:34:43,976
What?

486
00:34:43,977 --> 00:34:46,118
Listen,
that's not what we meant.

487
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:50,624
If that plane takes off, then
you can forget about Max Klemp.

488
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,904
-Garrett?
-Yeah.

489
00:34:55,905 --> 00:34:58,898
<i>-You see that plane about to take off?
-Yeah.</i>

490
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:01,320
Don't let it.

491
00:35:01,321 --> 00:35:02,971
Really?

492
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:10,349
Where are you going?

493
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,957
To watch you.

494
00:35:13,373 --> 00:35:15,347
What the hell are you doing?

495
00:35:15,348 --> 00:35:17,404
We've got a plane to catch.

496
00:35:17,405 --> 00:35:19,685
You can watch
from right here.

497
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:32,745
Stop! Stop!

498
00:36:58,989 --> 00:37:00,836
Garrett,
get out in front of it.

499
00:37:00,837 --> 00:37:02,613
Yeah, I'm on it.

500
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:05,814
What the hell?

501
00:38:06,726 --> 00:38:08,657
Congratulations.

502
00:38:08,658 --> 00:38:12,605
You just robbed one of Max
Klemp's private planes.

503
00:38:12,606 --> 00:38:15,880
He owns this airstrip
and everything in it.

504
00:38:15,881 --> 00:38:20,008
I'm quite sure he'll be looking
for an introduction to you now.

505
00:39:24,122 --> 00:39:27,703
You've got some balls.
Good for you.

506
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:33,498
My pilot, on the other
hand, was weak.

507
00:39:34,452 --> 00:39:36,774
I can't stand the weak.

508
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:44,039
So you two took Kuhn
for a bit of a ride?

509
00:39:44,321 --> 00:39:45,202
Something like that.

510
00:39:45,203 --> 00:39:47,805
Do you know how much
a new propeller costs?

511
00:39:47,806 --> 00:39:50,871
We're worth it, though,
if I may, Mr. Klemp.

512
00:39:50,872 --> 00:39:53,517
My brother and I have pulled
jobs on all five continents.

513
00:39:53,518 --> 00:39:57,674
Your car collection is legendary.
We can help you add to it.

514
00:39:57,675 --> 00:40:01,887
Any car, any time.
We're not rookies.

515
00:40:01,958 --> 00:40:04,239
I think our work
speaks for itself.

516
00:40:04,647 --> 00:40:06,661
You can easily hire the gutter
punks down in Marseille

517
00:40:06,662 --> 00:40:08,005
to steal
what needs stealing,

518
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:10,958
but if you want
it done right...

519
00:40:11,408 --> 00:40:13,016
Well,

520
00:40:13,255 --> 00:40:15,829
we have a reputation.

521
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,091
You.

522
00:40:19,092 --> 00:40:20,003
Me?

523
00:40:20,004 --> 00:40:24,055
No, the one without the mouth,
the big guy. Come here.

524
00:40:26,815 --> 00:40:28,511
Come on, big guy.

525
00:40:28,512 --> 00:40:31,344
Hold this nail for me.

526
00:40:31,936 --> 00:40:35,567
You know, my brother really
handles the negotiation.

527
00:40:35,568 --> 00:40:38,981
There's nothing to negotiate.

528
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,553
You see, I don't care about reputation
or how good you think you are.

529
00:40:48,554 --> 00:40:50,670
I care about one thing.

530
00:40:50,671 --> 00:40:52,949
Trust.

531
00:40:53,524 --> 00:40:57,507
There are not many people
in this town you can trust.

532
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:00,565
What makes you think
you're one of them?

533
00:41:00,566 --> 00:41:03,340
We're not from this town.

534
00:41:03,981 --> 00:41:07,027
Neither am I.

535
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:17,677
You can buy trust,
Mr. Klemp.

536
00:41:17,678 --> 00:41:20,515
Respect,
on the other hand,

537
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:23,803
you can't put a price on that.

538
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,591
I'll be in touch.

539
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:35,195
Thank you.

540
00:41:39,523 --> 00:41:41,126
You know what?

541
00:41:42,155 --> 00:41:43,757
Something wrong?

542
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:45,762
I'm a car enthusiast.

543
00:41:46,874 --> 00:41:48,685
You wanna see my garage.

544
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:55,701
Don't you think I know that
you're Jacomo Morier's cousin?

545
00:41:55,936 --> 00:41:57,899
-Second cousin.
-Second cousin.

546
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,486
I think.

547
00:41:59,487 --> 00:42:00,404
I never get
those things right.

548
00:42:00,405 --> 00:42:03,219
First cousin once removed,
second cousin...

549
00:42:04,247 --> 00:42:05,333
Why are you here?

550
00:42:05,334 --> 00:42:07,729
-Look, Mr. Klemp...
-Let him answer.

551
00:42:09,635 --> 00:42:14,830
Two years ago, I went to
my cousin to ask for work.

552
00:42:16,485 --> 00:42:18,880
In front of all his men,
he spun me around,

553
00:42:19,575 --> 00:42:21,177
kicked me in the ass.

554
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:25,981
Told me to go beg for scraps
in someone else's junkyard.

555
00:42:26,716 --> 00:42:28,862
Said our blood
meant nothing to him.

556
00:42:29,723 --> 00:42:32,078
Let me tell you
something, Mr. Klemp.

557
00:42:32,397 --> 00:42:34,292
When an opportunity
comes along

558
00:42:34,694 --> 00:42:36,839
where he's standing
on a cliff's edge,

559
00:42:40,332 --> 00:42:41,934
I'll be the one to push.

560
00:42:44,048 --> 00:42:45,943
Is that so?

561
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:26,246
Beautiful.

562
00:43:26,774 --> 00:43:29,044
GTO 250.

563
00:43:29,781 --> 00:43:32,427
I haven't seen one of these
outside a car magazine.

564
00:43:33,498 --> 00:43:35,392
She's gorgeous.

565
00:43:35,419 --> 00:43:36,713
It's not a car.

566
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,316
It's a masterpiece.

567
00:43:38,426 --> 00:43:40,195
Trumps them all, right?

568
00:43:42,811 --> 00:43:45,204
All right, enough.
Get out of here.

569
00:44:00,954 --> 00:44:02,997
Here, keep this safe.

570
00:44:02,998 --> 00:44:04,749
He's a liability.

571
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,351
What did you say?

572
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,544
I said you're
a goddamn liability,

573
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:10,546
and the last thing I need
is an amateur in my crew.

574
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:11,839
Amateur?

575
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,484
You wouldn't even have looked in
the garage if it weren't for me.

576
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:16,552
I clocked that garage
in the first five seconds.

577
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:18,471
What I didn't do
is draw attention to it.

578
00:44:18,472 --> 00:44:20,407
I found out what
needed finding out.

579
00:44:20,516 --> 00:44:21,683
You got the code,
didn't you?

580
00:44:21,684 --> 00:44:24,035
No, you overplayed
your hand.

581
00:44:24,269 --> 00:44:26,288
Having you around
was a mistake.

582
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,416
You think my cousin is going
to let you go on without me?

583
00:44:29,775 --> 00:44:31,501
I wouldn't bet on it.

584
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:36,339
You know, what you said earlier
about throwing Morier off a cliff,

585
00:44:36,782 --> 00:44:38,383
was that true?

586
00:44:38,826 --> 00:44:40,510
I love my cousin.

587
00:44:41,704 --> 00:44:43,305
All right.

588
00:44:53,966 --> 00:44:56,109
Really? What now?

589
00:44:56,802 --> 00:44:58,278
They forced their way in and
said they would wait for you.

590
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:02,056
Officer DePaul with INTERPOL,
and this is Officer Closson.

591
00:45:02,057 --> 00:45:03,850
You are Garrett
and Andrew Foster?

592
00:45:03,851 --> 00:45:05,601
Yeah, that's right.

593
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:07,454
And who's this?

594
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:09,856
-Simon Dardin.
-Sorry. What?

595
00:45:09,857 --> 00:45:11,499
Simon Dardin.

596
00:45:12,693 --> 00:45:14,068
What is this about?

597
00:45:14,069 --> 00:45:15,737
Well, you tell me.

598
00:45:15,738 --> 00:45:18,614
Why would we be here
standing in your apartment?

599
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:20,467
Well, I don't know.

600
00:45:20,659 --> 00:45:22,594
Seems illegal, though.

601
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:24,679
Do you have to have
a warrant in France?

602
00:45:25,956 --> 00:45:27,666
I think you have
to have a warrant.

603
00:45:27,667 --> 00:45:29,834
Funny guy.

604
00:45:29,835 --> 00:45:33,338
We are investigating a stolen
car ring all over Europe,

605
00:45:33,339 --> 00:45:35,965
and the names that we
hear again and again

606
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:38,885
are two brothers
named Foster.

607
00:45:38,886 --> 00:45:43,657
Yeah. Are you sure that it's "Foster"
coming up and not "Fosterre"?

608
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:47,285
I see. You are smart guys.

609
00:45:51,565 --> 00:45:53,316
I love smart guys.

610
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:55,418
I love to watch them crack.

611
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:57,779
I love that moment in their eyes

612
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,782
when they realize
they're not so smart.

613
00:46:00,783 --> 00:46:04,260
You must see that every morning
when you're brushing your teeth.

614
00:46:06,914 --> 00:46:10,392
See you soon,
Foster brothers.

615
00:46:13,128 --> 00:46:15,605
We'll be there
when you're not so smart.

616
00:46:25,683 --> 00:46:27,809
Seems like I need to be more
worried about the two of you

617
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:30,328
than you need
to worry about me.

618
00:46:30,396 --> 00:46:32,689
We need to get
the hell out of here.

619
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,749
Yeah, good luck with that.

620
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:37,360
Listen, you say one word
of this to your cousin,

621
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:41,172
and I'll be the person
throwing somebody off a cliff.

622
00:46:41,657 --> 00:46:43,508
Yeah?

623
00:46:50,485 --> 00:46:53,570
Tell me your "drop this"
radar isn't going off.

624
00:46:53,571 --> 00:46:55,172
I'm ignoring it.

625
00:46:55,198 --> 00:46:56,365
You shouldn't.

626
00:46:56,366 --> 00:46:58,926
Well, that's why I have you.

627
00:46:59,302 --> 00:47:02,013
We're just relying on way too
many people we don't know

628
00:47:02,014 --> 00:47:04,448
for this not to go sideways.

629
00:47:04,641 --> 00:47:07,702
We're a team.
Remember?

630
00:47:08,103 --> 00:47:09,228
The sooner you start
to realize that,

631
00:47:09,229 --> 00:47:12,039
the sooner we can
just get on with it.

632
00:47:17,988 --> 00:47:20,990
You really think I wanna steal
cars for the rest of my life?

633
00:47:20,991 --> 00:47:23,801
There are other ways
to make Dad proud.

634
00:47:27,998 --> 00:47:30,600
Stubborn old dog,
wasn't he?

635
00:47:31,251 --> 00:47:33,978
Never thought I'd forgive
him when he left.

636
00:47:34,296 --> 00:47:36,606
Then seeing him
in that hospital bed,

637
00:47:37,132 --> 00:47:39,984
chasing dreams
till the very end.

638
00:47:40,427 --> 00:47:42,469
He wasn't the best dad.

639
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:45,823
He brought us together,
though, didn't he?

640
00:47:50,103 --> 00:47:53,689
It's just Stephanie.
She... She changes things.

641
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:56,876
No, Andrew.
She doesn't.

642
00:47:57,444 --> 00:47:58,652
The reason
why you love her

643
00:47:58,653 --> 00:48:00,696
is because she's more like
us than you care to admit.

644
00:48:00,697 --> 00:48:03,049
Surely, you see that.

645
00:48:04,993 --> 00:48:06,368
So what are you saying?

646
00:48:06,369 --> 00:48:08,746
We continue to work together
as a threesome?

647
00:48:08,747 --> 00:48:11,207
Well,

648
00:48:11,208 --> 00:48:13,084
I mean, I wouldn't
have used that word,

649
00:48:13,085 --> 00:48:15,520
but now that you
mentioned it...

650
00:48:16,212 --> 00:48:17,980
Is there a moment
you can't ruin?

651
00:48:44,366 --> 00:48:47,409
Don't you know this market
isn't safe for foreigners?

652
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:48,630
Come with me.

653
00:48:48,631 --> 00:48:51,097
-Get your hands off me.
-Move it.

654
00:49:06,304 --> 00:49:07,905
Get out of my way!

655
00:49:37,502 --> 00:49:39,604
Don't we know them?

656
00:49:41,548 --> 00:49:43,649
Panahi's men.

657
00:49:44,467 --> 00:49:46,944
Run!

658
00:50:01,484 --> 00:50:03,127
Go left!

659
00:52:06,443 --> 00:52:08,694
-They took her.
-What?

660
00:52:08,695 --> 00:52:11,881
Morier's men, they snatched
Stephanie at the market.

661
00:52:20,415 --> 00:52:22,058
Morier!

662
00:52:23,418 --> 00:52:25,269
Hey, hold it
right there!

663
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:28,272
Hey.

664
00:52:28,465 --> 00:52:31,025
Watch your manners, boy.

665
00:52:31,426 --> 00:52:33,778
Where is she?

666
00:52:35,305 --> 00:52:36,906
Try it.

667
00:52:39,559 --> 00:52:42,019
You wanna see her?

668
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:43,788
Come on.

669
00:52:46,983 --> 00:52:48,317
-Steph!
-Andrew, stop!

670
00:52:48,318 --> 00:52:49,694
-No!
-Wait.

671
00:52:49,695 --> 00:52:51,696
Calm down.
Think about it.

672
00:52:51,697 --> 00:52:53,572
Stop. Stop!

673
00:52:53,573 --> 00:52:56,533
I understand you boys are thinking
of running away from France

674
00:52:56,534 --> 00:52:57,535
-without stealing the one car I want.
-No!

675
00:52:57,536 --> 00:52:59,453
-Wait!
-You're trying to make a fool of me.

676
00:52:59,454 --> 00:53:03,057
-She's not in this!
-Everyone is in this.

677
00:53:06,036 --> 00:53:07,937
No!

678
00:53:08,139 --> 00:53:09,833
Please.

679
00:53:09,834 --> 00:53:11,384
If you don't bring me
that vintage Ferrari,

680
00:53:11,385 --> 00:53:14,804
this pretty girl's face will
be nothing but a skid mark.

681
00:53:14,805 --> 00:53:16,306
Then I'm gonna kill
everyone you know.

682
00:53:16,307 --> 00:53:18,184
<i>Everyone you ever
said bonjour to.</i>

683
00:53:18,185 --> 00:53:20,143
I'm gonna kill
every last one of them

684
00:53:20,144 --> 00:53:23,455
in ways that would make
the devil hide his eyes.

685
00:53:24,106 --> 00:53:27,108
-Am I making myself completely clear?
-Yes.

686
00:53:27,109 --> 00:53:31,070
Well then, let's consider our
deal officially renegotiated.

687
00:53:31,071 --> 00:53:32,864
I wanna hear your plan,

688
00:53:32,865 --> 00:53:35,675
and I wanna meet your crew,
every last one of them.

689
00:53:36,076 --> 00:53:38,845
Can I have a word with
my brother for a second?

690
00:53:39,538 --> 00:53:41,556
Come on. Andrew!

691
00:53:43,542 --> 00:53:45,686
Think.

692
00:53:46,253 --> 00:53:49,589
-This changes everything.
-No, it doesn't, Andrew.

693
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:51,775
We can adapt.

694
00:53:53,219 --> 00:53:56,530
-I can't lose her.
-Neither can I.

695
00:53:57,264 --> 00:53:58,865
Hey.

696
00:54:01,018 --> 00:54:02,703
Yeah?

697
00:54:08,901 --> 00:54:12,713
Okay. You wanna
know the plan?

698
00:54:13,572 --> 00:54:15,799
<i>Meet us and our team tomorrow
morning at the chapelle.</i>

699
00:54:29,588 --> 00:54:32,215
So, let's hear how
you're gonna do this.

700
00:54:32,216 --> 00:54:34,050
The best way to steal
from a thief

701
00:54:34,051 --> 00:54:36,177
is to lure him away
from the stash.

702
00:54:36,178 --> 00:54:38,179
How are we gonna do that?

703
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:39,865
Well...

704
00:54:41,225 --> 00:54:44,703
<i>First, we're gonna get our
hands on a bulldozer.</i>

705
00:54:52,945 --> 00:54:54,963
<i>Then we're gonna
steal some stuff.</i>

706
00:54:55,197 --> 00:54:59,843
<i>Police cars, police vans,</i>

707
00:55:00,369 --> 00:55:02,804
<i>and some riot gear.</i>

708
00:55:12,923 --> 00:55:14,775
So you're gonna
boost police cars.

709
00:55:14,884 --> 00:55:16,926
Klemp has a lot of
policemen in his pocket.

710
00:55:16,927 --> 00:55:19,821
We know, and we're
counting on that.

711
00:55:24,101 --> 00:55:26,102
-Yes?
-Max Klemp?

712
00:55:26,103 --> 00:55:28,188
This is Corinne from the
police station in Marseille.

713
00:55:28,189 --> 00:55:31,625
I was told to tip you that you
are being raided sometime today.

714
00:55:44,455 --> 00:55:46,247
-Come on. Let's go.
-Alpha team left.

715
00:55:46,248 --> 00:55:48,917
Bravo, right.
Go, go, go!

716
00:55:48,918 --> 00:55:50,335
<i>If you back
a rat into a corner,</i>

717
00:55:50,336 --> 00:55:52,921
<i>he'll bare his teeth
and fight to the death.</i>

718
00:55:52,922 --> 00:55:57,818
<i>But if you give that rat
an option, he'll take it.</i>

719
00:55:58,052 --> 00:56:00,970
<i>And then you can steer him in
whichever direction you want.</i>

720
00:56:00,971 --> 00:56:03,949
<i>And how are you
sure he'll run?</i>

721
00:56:03,974 --> 00:56:06,351
<i>Because all rats
desert a sinking ship.</i>

722
00:56:06,352 --> 00:56:07,685
<i>It's instinct.</i>

723
00:56:07,686 --> 00:56:10,146
<i>Just remember, you're dealing
with a very smart rat.</i>

724
00:56:10,147 --> 00:56:11,998
We're smarter.

725
00:56:18,595 --> 00:56:20,238
What the hell is this?

726
00:56:20,347 --> 00:56:22,198
Just be cool.

727
00:56:33,235 --> 00:56:35,712
Weapons down! Now!

728
00:57:16,654 --> 00:57:19,256
How stupid
do you think I am?

729
00:57:20,491 --> 00:57:22,533
The minute your cousin
stepped foot on my property,

730
00:57:22,534 --> 00:57:24,302
I knew you were
up to something.

731
00:57:25,704 --> 00:57:28,890
You learned nothing
from our history.

732
00:57:29,541 --> 00:57:32,585
You have something
of value, I take it.

733
00:57:32,586 --> 00:57:37,774
The drugs, the mule routes,
the ports, and now Marseille.

734
00:57:38,342 --> 00:57:42,028
This is my town.
I'll never let you take it.

735
00:57:43,514 --> 00:57:45,306
I tell you one thing.

736
00:57:45,307 --> 00:57:47,558
I'm always 10
steps ahead of him,

737
00:57:47,559 --> 00:57:50,287
so whatever you're gonna do,

738
00:57:50,562 --> 00:57:52,873
I'd think twice.

739
00:57:56,652 --> 00:57:59,921
Good to see you,
old friend.

740
00:58:26,265 --> 00:58:28,684
Take him tomorrow,
and I am coming with you.

741
00:58:28,685 --> 00:58:30,519
That's not a good idea
if we're gonna do this.

742
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,412
"If"?

743
00:58:32,688 --> 00:58:36,733
I say tomorrow.
And I'll drive that car.

744
00:58:36,734 --> 00:58:39,836
7:00 a.m.
Here.

745
00:58:52,383 --> 00:58:54,592
Too bad we have to leave
your sexy girl behind?

746
00:58:54,593 --> 00:58:57,654
I'm sure my cousin will
take good care of her.

747
00:59:08,232 --> 00:59:11,251
Hey, I wanna talk to someone.

748
00:59:12,236 --> 00:59:15,047
Listen, you bastards,
let me out!

749
00:59:41,265 --> 00:59:42,866
Thanks.

750
00:59:47,396 --> 00:59:49,439
So, the food is good?

751
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,250
I see you are still
getting along so well.

752
00:59:52,526 --> 00:59:54,152
Although
I should tell you,

753
00:59:54,153 --> 00:59:56,963
we have discovered that
you are not Simon Dardin.

754
00:59:57,448 --> 00:59:59,491
<i>You are the cousin
of Monsieur Jacomo Morier</i>

755
00:59:59,492 --> 01:00:01,968
from right here
in Marseille.

756
01:00:02,369 --> 01:00:03,912
Good work, officers.

757
01:00:03,913 --> 01:00:07,516
You should be proud
of your investigative skills.

758
01:00:09,085 --> 01:00:11,461
You lied to us.
We know something is up.

759
01:00:11,462 --> 01:00:13,922
And when we find out
what it is,

760
01:00:13,923 --> 01:00:16,983
we'll all be spending
much more time together.

761
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:19,111
I guarantee that.

762
01:00:32,525 --> 01:00:36,128
You know,
I'm going to enjoy this.

763
01:00:36,612 --> 01:00:38,213
What are you talking about?

764
01:00:38,823 --> 01:00:42,700
We can't have them follow us,
or none of this is gonna work.

765
01:00:42,701 --> 01:00:47,764
So, we're gonna have INTERPOL
think that we had a falling out.

766
01:00:48,499 --> 01:00:50,350
-Falling out?
-Yeah.

767
01:00:55,297 --> 01:00:57,024
Son of a bitch!

768
01:00:59,468 --> 01:01:01,194
Morier's cousin?

769
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:03,905
Come on.

770
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:15,125
If you insist. Thanks.

771
01:01:18,362 --> 01:01:21,381
Andrew! Wait.
Where are you going?

772
01:01:38,591 --> 01:01:40,317
All alone again?

773
01:01:41,385 --> 01:01:43,195
Story of my life.

774
01:01:43,721 --> 01:01:45,555
Mind if I join you?

775
01:01:45,556 --> 01:01:47,574
Look, I'm really
not in the mood.

776
01:01:52,598 --> 01:01:54,241
Nice.

777
01:01:55,267 --> 01:01:56,559
It's not my flavor.

778
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:57,436
Yeah, you're right.

779
01:01:57,437 --> 01:02:00,789
Ferrari has never made
a car like the 166.

780
01:02:02,525 --> 01:02:03,566
What did you just say?

781
01:02:03,567 --> 01:02:06,361
Well, my father spent
20 years restoring one.

782
01:02:06,362 --> 01:02:07,529
The original
red Barchetta?

783
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:09,256
Yes.

784
01:02:09,657 --> 01:02:11,950
-That's my favorite car.
-Really?

785
01:02:11,951 --> 01:02:13,410
Did you ever
get to drive it?

786
01:02:13,411 --> 01:02:15,762
Every Sunday afternoon.

787
01:02:17,331 --> 01:02:20,291
Look, I appreciate
what you're trying to do.

788
01:02:20,292 --> 01:02:23,895
It's gonna be okay, Garrett.
We're gonna do this.

789
01:02:24,505 --> 01:02:26,273
Come here.

790
01:03:17,266 --> 01:03:19,017
What?
What do you want?

791
01:03:19,018 --> 01:03:20,477
I'm hungry.

792
01:03:20,478 --> 01:03:22,687
Hey. Hey.

793
01:03:22,688 --> 01:03:24,915
Come on. Please.

794
01:03:28,277 --> 01:03:30,337
I thought we could
eat together.

795
01:03:33,324 --> 01:03:35,175
What do you think?

796
01:03:36,786 --> 01:03:38,620
You think I'm stupid?

797
01:03:38,621 --> 01:03:41,181
You think I'm gonna fall
for your little trick?

798
01:03:41,624 --> 01:03:44,226
Well, you fell for
Andrew's, didn't you?

799
01:03:44,502 --> 01:03:46,353
I bet you didn't
even fight back.

800
01:03:46,379 --> 01:03:48,272
What did you say?

801
01:03:49,382 --> 01:03:51,441
What did you say?

802
01:03:59,809 --> 01:04:02,160
Come here.

803
01:04:05,064 --> 01:04:06,873
Nice try.

804
01:04:30,112 --> 01:04:35,119
-****?
-***.

805
01:04:46,177 --> 01:04:49,105
***.

806
01:05:04,069 --> 01:05:07,473
-***?
-***.

807
01:05:17,377 --> 01:05:20,303
Okay, this is it.

808
01:05:20,304 --> 01:05:22,865
You know what to do.

809
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,855
Buckle up.

810
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:33,631
Okay.
Let's roll.

811
01:05:51,611 --> 01:05:53,629
-Hello?
-Max Klemp.

812
01:06:38,032 --> 01:06:40,325
<i>-Monsieur Morier?
-Oui?</i>

813
01:06:40,326 --> 01:06:41,660
INTERPOL.

814
01:06:41,661 --> 01:06:43,512
Out of the car, please.

815
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:06,160
Get the car.
We're leaving.

816
01:07:09,355 --> 01:07:11,707
Everyone back up.

817
01:07:21,993 --> 01:07:23,702
<i>Merde.</i>

818
01:07:23,703 --> 01:07:25,162
<i>Forgive me for being direct,
Monsieur Morier,</i>

819
01:07:25,163 --> 01:07:29,558
but are you not here expecting to
meet two men by the name of Foster?

820
01:07:30,126 --> 01:07:32,127
I don't know
what you're speaking of.

821
01:07:32,128 --> 01:07:34,755
I'm speaking of the two
men whom we witnessed

822
01:07:34,756 --> 01:07:37,382
beating Mr. Laurent here.

823
01:07:37,383 --> 01:07:41,386
I'm speaking of the two men who are
going to incite a crime war for you.

824
01:07:41,387 --> 01:07:43,447
You are all under arrest.

825
01:08:27,748 --> 01:08:28,999
<i>Merde.</i>

826
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,461
-You've got to be kidding me.
-It's okay. I have more, yeah?

827
01:08:31,462 --> 01:08:33,996
We don't have time.
We've got to get inside now.

828
01:08:41,245 --> 01:08:43,162
<i>The best way
to steal from a thief</i>

829
01:08:43,163 --> 01:08:45,974
<i>is to lure him away
from the stash.</i>

830
01:09:00,773 --> 01:09:02,732
You work out of the
Brussels office, yes?

831
01:09:02,733 --> 01:09:04,417
That's right.

832
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:07,946
Tell Officer Vanderberg

833
01:09:07,947 --> 01:09:10,198
this is the second time
he sends his bees to sting me,

834
01:09:10,199 --> 01:09:11,950
and it won't work
this time, either.

835
01:09:11,951 --> 01:09:13,718
I will tell him.

836
01:09:14,161 --> 01:09:16,346
There is no
Officer Vanderberg.

837
01:09:31,095 --> 01:09:33,822
I told you I could be
your inside girl.

838
01:09:33,889 --> 01:09:36,099
Never doubted you
for a second.

839
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:38,285
You're an idiot.

840
01:09:41,438 --> 01:09:43,748
Tick-tock, turtledoves.

841
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:16,740
Fire in the hole.

842
01:10:17,474 --> 01:10:19,534
Come on.

843
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,330
Yes!

844
01:11:11,904 --> 01:11:13,905
Hey.

845
01:11:13,906 --> 01:11:16,033
I hope you're out of there
because you've got trouble.

846
01:11:16,034 --> 01:11:17,867
What kind of trouble?

847
01:11:17,868 --> 01:11:20,512
Morier made us.
He's heading home.

848
01:11:31,215 --> 01:11:33,566
Come on.

849
01:11:46,563 --> 01:11:47,897
Come on.

850
01:11:47,898 --> 01:11:49,958
You all in?

851
01:12:05,916 --> 01:12:07,892
Yeah!

852
01:12:18,595 --> 01:12:22,407
All right, guys, whatever you
do, don't wreck these cars.

853
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:44,554
-Shit.
-What?

854
01:12:46,323 --> 01:12:48,467
You looking for this?

855
01:12:56,042 --> 01:12:58,043
Andrew, we don't have time.

856
01:12:58,044 --> 01:12:59,669
-Look at me.
-But...

857
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:01,480
Steph.

858
01:13:03,799 --> 01:13:05,651
Will you marry me?

859
01:13:09,346 --> 01:13:11,615
You're crazy.

860
01:13:14,977 --> 01:13:16,352
Yes.

861
01:13:16,353 --> 01:13:18,664
Yes, go. Go!
Go now.

862
01:13:47,847 --> 01:13:51,367
All right, proceed as planned.
We'll take the canyon.

863
01:17:20,949 --> 01:17:23,301
<i>Leon, get ready to blow
that bridge behind us.</i>

864
01:17:56,694 --> 01:17:58,503
Andrew, it's not worth it.

865
01:18:12,251 --> 01:18:14,519
Andrew, no!

866
01:18:42,781 --> 01:18:44,549
The Riviera Run.

867
01:20:16,166 --> 01:20:18,226
Damn.

868
01:20:33,684 --> 01:20:36,328
Devin, hope you're
ready for Plan B.

869
01:20:36,395 --> 01:20:38,204
<i>I'm ready.</i>

870
01:21:20,898 --> 01:21:23,250
Andrew, what are you doing?

871
01:21:30,908 --> 01:21:34,386
Morier, this ends now.

872
01:21:57,893 --> 01:21:59,661
What part
of the plan is this?

873
01:22:00,104 --> 01:22:02,289
Thought you didn't
need a plan.

874
01:22:46,984 --> 01:22:48,985
I will call you.

875
01:22:48,986 --> 01:22:50,670
I promise.

876
01:23:22,628 --> 01:23:24,229
Yeah.

877
01:23:27,425 --> 01:23:30,110
-Guys.
-Yeah, it's cool.

878
01:23:32,672 --> 01:23:35,908
Officers.
Glad to see you.

879
01:23:37,310 --> 01:23:39,436
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'll be fine. Don't worry.

880
01:23:39,437 --> 01:23:41,163
Good.

881
01:23:41,564 --> 01:23:43,165
Hey.

882
01:23:44,275 --> 01:23:45,650
Next time,
we want to drive.

883
01:23:45,651 --> 01:23:47,294
You've got it.

884
01:24:06,506 --> 01:24:08,006
Thanks for playing along.

885
01:24:08,007 --> 01:24:09,942
Anytime.

886
01:24:15,765 --> 01:24:19,326
By the way, the guy in the
barrel, was it too much?

887
01:24:19,435 --> 01:24:21,328
No, it was
a nice touch.

888
01:24:21,396 --> 01:24:22,997
Good.

889
01:24:49,465 --> 01:24:53,235
I have to hand it to you,
it was a bold plan.

890
01:24:53,469 --> 01:24:56,447
Yeah? Well, you
know what they say.

891
01:24:57,724 --> 01:25:00,326
Fortune favors the bold.

892
01:25:12,488 --> 01:25:14,740
Why does this
keep happening to me?

893
01:25:14,741 --> 01:25:16,867
I'm a good person.
I mean, I talk a lot,

894
01:25:16,868 --> 01:25:19,345
but I don't deserve
to be blown off every time.

895
01:25:20,538 --> 01:25:23,432
-That phone's not gonna ring.
-You don't know that.

896
01:25:25,084 --> 01:25:27,394
Yes, I do.

897
01:25:29,756 --> 01:25:32,024
What is that I hear?

898
01:25:51,569 --> 01:25:54,171
-Any trouble?
-Nope.

899
01:25:58,117 --> 01:26:01,387
You are beautiful.
You know that?

900
01:26:01,704 --> 01:26:04,056
That's my favorite thing
about her.

901
01:26:04,457 --> 01:26:06,100
The ability to shut him up.

902
01:26:15,468 --> 01:26:16,843
What?

903
01:26:16,844 --> 01:26:19,238
My God!

904
01:26:22,558 --> 01:26:23,934
Did I ever tell you
about the time

905
01:26:23,935 --> 01:26:27,437
I changed the oil
on that '62 Ferrari?

906
01:26:27,438 --> 01:26:30,899
Greatest goddamn day a grease
jockey like me ever had.

907
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:33,085
It's all yours, old man.

908
01:26:35,446 --> 01:26:37,155
So that's it, then?

909
01:26:37,156 --> 01:26:39,216
We're done?

910
01:26:40,618 --> 01:26:43,345
-You know...
-What?

911
01:26:43,871 --> 01:26:45,706
There is one more thing.

912
01:26:45,707 --> 01:26:48,166
A '53 Sierra Coupe.

913
01:26:48,167 --> 01:26:50,561
There are only
nine in the world.

914
01:26:51,170 --> 01:26:53,230
And one is in Barcelona.

915
01:26:53,881 --> 01:26:55,482
You up for it?

916
01:26:56,592 --> 01:26:58,485
I'm driving.

917
01:27:06,728 --> 01:27:10,331
You think I bought that you
just came up with that plan?

918
01:27:10,523 --> 01:27:12,524
A wise man once told me,

919
01:27:12,525 --> 01:27:15,144
"If you look around and can't
see who the mark is...

920
01:27:15,145 --> 01:27:17,254
"Then it's you."
