Hello. My name is...
[clears throat]

[sighs]

8
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:46,781
Hi.

00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:53,521
[exhales deeply]

10
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,557
[sniffs] Yeah.

11
00:01:01,763 --> 00:01:03,263
Hi. My name is...

[exhales]

13
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:27,822
Ayar.

[squeaky harmonica]

23
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,535
[owner] No, no.

24
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,837
No, she's related
to the old cleaning lady.

25
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,540
She's a cousin or niece,
I don't know...

26
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:28,776
Oh. No, I'm gonna make her
wear a mask and gloves.

27
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,578
And she leaves
her clothes here after...

28
00:03:30,912 --> 00:03:32,747
He's fine. I mean, he actually,

29
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,282
he made a ton of money
on some mask company.

30
00:03:35,717 --> 00:03:37,652
I know, it's so sad, but yeah.

31
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,420
I should go. Yeah, okay,

32
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,389
let's plan a play date
this weekend, okay?

33
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:43,524
All right.

34
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:45,727
I'm so sorry.

35
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,327
I don't know where
my days get away from me now.

36
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,696
- No problem.
- Sorry. Thanks for waiting.

37
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:51,799
[Ayar sighs]

38
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,739
[Ayar] What is it?

39
00:03:57,772 --> 00:03:59,507
[owner chuckles]
Sorry. Nothing. You're just...

40
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,408
You're just so much younger
than I was expecting.

41
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,810
- [Ayar grunts]
- How are you related

42
00:04:02,844 --> 00:04:04,444
- to Maria again?
- [Ayar] I'm not.

43
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:05,980
She's my friend's mother.

44
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:07,849
[owner] She told me
you just moved back from Vegas.

45
00:04:07,882 --> 00:04:09,684
Were you working at a hotel?

46
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:12,687
I was working as a singer,

47
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,387
but I came back
to be with my daughter.

48
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,057
[owner] Your English
is really good.

49
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,692
How long have you been here?

50
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:19,259
Since I was thirteen.

51
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:23,430
[owner]
Well, the house is really big.

52
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:24,999
[chuckles]

53
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:26,868
Lots of rooms. Four bathrooms,
we only use two of them,

54
00:04:26,901 --> 00:04:28,870
so you have to clean
two every week.

55
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:32,472
But we used to use
all the natural products,

56
00:04:32,507 --> 00:04:33,875
but they just honestly
don't get the job done,

57
00:04:33,908 --> 00:04:35,777
so now we just
use bleach on everything.

58
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:38,913
We like the floors done,
the windows done weekly,

59
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,015
laundry... you know?

60
00:04:41,516 --> 00:04:42,850
Sure. No problem.

61
00:04:42,884 --> 00:04:43,951
- Okay.
- Okay.

62
00:04:43,985 --> 00:04:45,052
[owner chuckles] Well.

63
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:46,888
I can show you
where the supplies are,

64
00:04:46,921 --> 00:04:48,321
you can get started now.

65
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:50,725
No, sorry. I can't start today.

66
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:52,459
[owner]
Oh, I thought we said today.

67
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:53,861
[Ayar] No, we discussed Monday.

68
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:56,531
We said on Monday.
I can start on Monday.

69
00:04:57,565 --> 00:04:58,900
[owner] Huh. Okay.

70
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:00,701
Yeah, I guess that's fine.
[chuckles]

71
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:02,003
- Sure.
- [Ayar] All right.

72
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:03,470
[owner] See you Monday.

73
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:04,806
[keys clinking]

74
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:08,943

77
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:25,526
[Ayar on phone]
<i>What do you want, Robert?</i>

78
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,595
[Robert] <i>I need to see you.</i>

79
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:28,796
<i>When are you coming back, Ayar?</i>

80
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:30,330
[Ayar] <i>I don't know.</i>

some big auditions.</i>

[Ayar] <i>I need to go.</i>

84
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:39,674
[Robert] <i>Please.</i>

85
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,943
<i>I'm coming to see you.</i>

86
00:05:41,976 --> 00:05:43,878
[Ayar] <i>No.
Her birthday is today. Don't.</i>

87
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,981
[Robert] <i>Why are you doing this?</i>

88
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:48,783
[Ayar] <i>I have to go.</i>

89
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:03,965
[Ayar] I'll be there soon.

90
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:06,067
[Julie] <i>Oh, yeah,
you must be so excited</i>

91
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,903
<i>to see her.
How long has it been?</i>

92
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:11,105
Long.

93
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:14,642
[sighs] Too long.

95
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,382
[Julie] <i>You're back now.</i>

96
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:24,752
<i>That's what matters.</i>

97
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:29,557
[Ayar]
I just hope it's not too late.

Get away from there!

100

What did you do with that? Stop!

Can you believe that my daughter
won't even come here anymore?

116
00:07:58,546 --> 00:08:01,549
She could go to the bar, but she
can't come and see her mom.

Who you looking for?

No. No, I think
I'm in the wrong place.

Are you okay?

Raj!

150
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:22,957
What? I was telling a story.
What happened?

[dramatic piano music]

152
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,310
Did you put a sick person
next to my room?

153
00:10:43,344 --> 00:10:45,112
- [Raj] What?
- Did you put someone with COVID

154
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:46,981
- next to me?
- She said they had no symptoms

155
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:48,149
- when they checked in.
- They said

156
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:49,717
this wasn't a COVID motel.

157
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,085
- It's not.
- Then why is the lady next door

158
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:52,386
coughing her lungs out?

159
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:53,988
She lied to me
when she checked in.

161
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,690
By the time I'm back,
she'd better be

162
00:10:56,724 --> 00:10:58,225
far, far away from my room.

163
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:00,861
- I will take care of it.
- Thanks. And please wear a mask.

164
00:11:00,895 --> 00:11:02,096
- [door creaks]
- Will do.

165

- Yeah!

That's a fancy top.

171
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:18,212
- What's the occasion?
- None of your business.

172
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:20,915
Why do I sense
you need someone to talk to?

- Hey, Raj!

174

00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:26,987
What was that earlier?

176
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:28,322
With what?

177
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:29,390
[Ayar] With the car.

178
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:31,692
Uh, with that car?

179
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:32,960
[Ayar] Uh-uh.

180
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:35,129

he turned to stone.

369
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,703

Good night.

No.

Don't worry.

Is she sick?

No.

she could find,

431
00:33:01,215 --> 00:33:03,450
and walked back
to my grandfather's bed,

432

was normal at first,

I was like a little man

of my skull and everything.

The first cases
of feeling unreal

512
00:36:45,773 --> 00:36:48,009

Depersonalization disorder?

517
00:37:03,024 --> 00:37:04,726
Someone gave it a name.

518
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:06,594
Now you believe?

Someone who came
before you said,

520
00:37:08,062 --> 00:37:09,564
do this, do that.

521
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:11,632
Now you're believin'.

522
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:13,266
I guess so.

523
00:37:13,868 --> 00:37:15,670
I ended up selling my apartment

524
00:37:15,703 --> 00:37:18,271
and all my shit, and I've
been traveling ever since.

525
00:37:19,941 --> 00:37:22,375
So you felt trapped
in a steady, well-paying job,

526
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,946
and you decided to say,
fuck it, and become a gypsy.

527
00:37:24,979 --> 00:37:27,380
[chuckles] Yeah.

528
00:37:27,715 --> 00:37:30,383
- Basically.
- What a luxury.

529
00:37:32,086 --> 00:37:35,489
My dad worked a job he hated
until the day he died.

530
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:43,598
Now they want us
all to stay in place.

531
00:37:45,566 --> 00:37:48,936
Don't you feel lonely,
traveling all the time?

532
00:37:55,342 --> 00:37:56,811
I miss my son.

533

He's in college now.

534
00:38:01,549 --> 00:38:03,518
He barely talks to me.

535
00:38:06,621 --> 00:38:07,822
Why?

536
00:38:09,524 --> 00:38:11,391
'Cause that's what happens.

537
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:13,594
People forget.

538
00:38:19,033 --> 00:38:22,003
I was working in Vegas
when everything shut down.

539
00:38:23,771 --> 00:38:25,573
What'd you do there?

540
00:38:26,941 --> 00:38:27,875
[exhales]

541
00:38:28,509 --> 00:38:30,878
I got my first gig after college

542
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,914
as a back-up singer in a show.

543
00:38:32,947 --> 00:38:34,882
[chuckles]

544
00:39:05,646 --> 00:39:07,447
My mom used to say,

545
00:39:09,116 --> 00:39:11,953
now you can be
anything you dream of, Ayar.

00:51:18,412 --> 00:51:20,380
that's eventually gonna explode.

728
00:51:20,414 --> 00:51:22,115
Stop it! Stop it! Stop!

729
00:51:22,149 --> 00:51:24,886
Just a minute! Stop!
Please, please. Stop it!

730
00:51:24,919 --> 00:51:26,521
[loud ticking]

731
00:52:03,825 --> 00:52:05,225
[doorbell chimes]

732
00:52:11,331 --> 00:52:14,468
[knocking on door]

733
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:17,437
[knocking continues]

734
00:52:18,906 --> 00:52:20,474
[knocking continues]

735
00:52:20,908 --> 00:52:22,744
[Robert] Ayar, please open up.

736
00:52:23,745 --> 00:52:26,246
- [Ayar mumbles]
- Please open the door.

737
00:52:27,447 --> 00:52:28,683
[knocking]

738
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:30,852
- [knocking]
- [Robert] Ayar.

739
00:52:31,552 --> 00:52:32,820
[door clicks]

740
00:52:36,758 --> 00:52:38,526
Why aren't you
returning my calls?

741
00:52:40,394 --> 00:52:41,461
What are you doing here?

742
00:52:42,362 --> 00:52:44,331
Please just stop this
and come back.

743
00:52:44,766 --> 00:52:46,266
You shouldn't have come.

744
00:52:47,835 --> 00:52:48,903
I love you, Ayar.

745
00:52:49,704 --> 00:52:52,472
You don't know
anything about love.

746
00:52:52,874 --> 00:52:54,241
Please.

747
00:52:54,676 --> 00:52:56,243
We can raise her together.

748
00:52:56,744 --> 00:52:57,745
We can be family.

749
00:52:58,513 --> 00:53:00,347
I'm never coming back, Robert.

750
00:53:02,617 --> 00:53:03,818
- Goodbye.
- [thud]

751
00:53:04,284 --> 00:53:06,486
You don't mean that.
You don't mean that.

752
00:53:06,521 --> 00:53:07,822
- [grunt]
- Don't say something

753
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:08,956
you're gonna regret.

754
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:10,558
[Ayar] Let go!

755
00:53:10,591 --> 00:53:12,292
Come on! Look,
I know I've made mistakes.

756
00:53:12,325 --> 00:53:14,428
- I know that. Please.
- [panting]

757
00:53:14,696 --> 00:53:16,531
- I'm sorry.
- Let go!

758
00:53:16,564 --> 00:53:17,899
- [slam]
- [groan]

759
00:53:18,298 --> 00:53:19,901
[grunting]

760
00:53:19,934 --> 00:53:22,335
Please, Ayar. [gasps]

761
00:53:24,605 --> 00:53:26,339
You feel that pain?

762
00:53:27,041 --> 00:53:28,442
You can use that.

763
00:53:29,476 --> 00:53:31,512
You can build from that.

764
00:53:31,546 --> 00:53:32,547
- [grunts]
- [slam]

765
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,482
[Robert] You think
you can just go back?

766
00:53:36,818 --> 00:53:37,952
Wake up!

767
00:53:38,351 --> 00:53:39,921
You're ashamed
of who you really are.

768
00:53:39,954 --> 00:53:43,390
You're scared to admit
that you're a nobody! Admit it!

769
00:53:43,758 --> 00:53:45,425
You're gonna
be a nobody forever!

770
00:53:45,459 --> 00:53:46,493
[chuckles] Oh, no.

771
00:53:46,527 --> 00:53:47,762
[Robert] People wanna see stars.

772
00:53:47,795 --> 00:53:49,630
The same people
over and over again.

773
00:53:49,664 --> 00:53:51,331
People don't care about you.

774
00:53:51,364 --> 00:53:52,700
Nobody's gonna watch this movie!

775
00:53:52,734 --> 00:53:55,335
Just shut up! And go away!

776
00:54:00,641 --> 00:54:01,909
[muffled coughing]

777
00:54:03,778 --> 00:54:06,948
[ominous music]

778
00:54:27,602 --> 00:54:29,871
[indistinct voices]

779
00:54:32,006 --> 00:54:34,041
[music swells]

780
00:54:47,454 --> 00:54:48,990
[labored breathing]

781
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:03,070
[coughing]

782
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,749
My name is Vilma Vega.

783
00:55:15,049 --> 00:55:16,884
I was born in Lima, Peru.

784
00:55:17,384 --> 00:55:18,653
I have one brother.

785
00:55:19,053 --> 00:55:21,488
My mother never received
a formal education,

786
00:55:21,522 --> 00:55:23,858
and she worked
as a maid for years.

787
00:55:24,158 --> 00:55:26,060
I met my father
for the first time

788
00:55:26,093 --> 00:55:27,795
this year of 2020.

789
00:55:28,095 --> 00:55:30,731
My heritage is
indigenous Peruvian.

790
00:55:30,965 --> 00:55:34,802
Both of my parents
were raised speaking Quechua

791
00:55:34,836 --> 00:55:36,704
and later learned Spanish.

792
00:55:37,705 --> 00:55:40,141
I left for the United States
to Los Angeles

793
00:55:40,174 --> 00:55:42,910
when I was 15 years old,
with my boyfriend.

794
00:55:43,711 --> 00:55:44,979
I loved him.

795
00:55:46,247 --> 00:55:49,116
It was a world of possibilities
filled with hopes and dreams.

796
00:55:49,817 --> 00:55:51,786
I wanted to be an actress.

797
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:54,088
And I got pregnant.

798
00:55:54,822 --> 00:55:56,824
And at the same time,
my boyfriend

799
00:55:56,858 --> 00:55:58,659
left me for another woman.

800
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,495
My mother-in-law
took custody of my child,

801
00:56:03,764 --> 00:56:05,566
and I was all alone.

802
00:56:07,068 --> 00:56:08,870
But I got an education.

803
00:56:08,903 --> 00:56:10,571
I learned English.

804
00:56:10,605 --> 00:56:13,541
I got a four-year college degree
from U.C. Davis.

805
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:16,944
And I got my citizenship
when I was 40 years old.

806
00:56:17,178 --> 00:56:20,882
It took just about
over twenty years.

807
00:56:22,482 --> 00:56:23,818
I worked several jobs.

808
00:56:23,851 --> 00:56:26,854
I worked as a bank teller,
babysitter,

809
00:56:27,555 --> 00:56:28,923
fast food worker,

810
00:56:28,956 --> 00:56:32,727
then sales,
then management and leadership.

811
00:56:33,861 --> 00:56:35,830
I missed my son every day.

812
00:56:40,201 --> 00:56:42,036
And I was finally
reunited with him

813
00:56:42,069 --> 00:56:43,838
when he was 15 years old.

814
00:56:44,205 --> 00:56:47,141
And last year, I took him
to a trip to Cuzco

815
00:56:47,909 --> 00:56:50,044
to show him where I was from.

816
00:56:52,847 --> 00:56:53,948
Two years ago,

817
00:56:54,949 --> 00:56:58,619
I decided that pursuing acting
wasn't too late.

818
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:10,564
[Ariana] Vilma, when you were
apart from your son,

819
00:57:10,598 --> 00:57:12,934
did you ever
think to yourself, I'm not...

820
00:57:12,967 --> 00:57:16,469
maybe I'm just gonna
forget about him. Like...

821
00:57:16,504 --> 00:57:17,672
There was a time where...

822
00:57:17,705 --> 00:57:19,206
So, the... yes.

823
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,509
You're after the success, right?

824
00:57:21,542 --> 00:57:24,812
It is to prove something,
to validate your absence,

825
00:57:24,845 --> 00:57:26,681
to validate you.

826
00:57:26,714 --> 00:57:28,616
The shame gets bigger,

827
00:57:28,649 --> 00:57:30,718
because that's what happens when
you don't put truth to the lie.

828
00:57:31,052 --> 00:57:33,921
You never know
for sure who you are.

829
00:57:33,955 --> 00:57:36,757
When I go into this hole,
or this rabbit hole,

830
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:39,260
my mom played this character,
my dad played this character,

831
00:57:39,293 --> 00:57:40,528
my brother.

832
00:57:40,561 --> 00:57:41,929
Like, am I part of a movie?

833
00:57:41,963 --> 00:57:43,864
And I'm just a character, then,

834
00:57:43,898 --> 00:57:47,234
so if I am,
then what do I get to create?

835
00:57:47,268 --> 00:57:49,136
- You know?
- [laughs]

836
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:52,807
I'm thinking of,
as, like, if I'm Ayar.

837
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,141
But, yeah, she's a role.

838
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:56,277
- She's a movie.
- [both laugh]

839
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:58,779
Right. It's probably
the real wake-up moment.

840
00:57:58,813 --> 00:58:02,783
Am I really in this world?
[laughs]

841
00:58:02,817 --> 00:58:05,052
That's like,
because, you know...

842
00:58:05,086 --> 00:58:06,687
Life is... [laughs]

843
00:58:06,721 --> 00:58:08,856
- [women indistinct]
- [man] Ayar.

844
00:58:08,889 --> 00:58:10,124
- Ayar!
- [snap]

845
00:58:11,292 --> 00:58:12,893
Hello, my name is
Henry Foster Brown, I'm...-

846
00:58:12,927 --> 00:58:14,695
Caesar Hartman

Hi, I'm Simon Haycock.
I'm 6' 1".

849
00:58:18,199 --> 00:58:19,867
- It's me.
- [Caesar] And stood there

00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,268
with a knife in her hands...-

851
00:58:21,302 --> 00:58:24,071
[Foster] As though I was
observing everything

852
00:58:24,105 --> 00:58:25,206
from a plate of glass.

853
00:58:25,239 --> 00:58:26,774
[singing]

854
00:58:26,807 --> 00:58:32,646
I am a middle-aged
gay, Jewish New Yorker.

855
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:35,049
I am born in Tijuana, Mexico...-

856
00:58:35,082 --> 00:58:38,019
We are indigenous to this land
and to Mexico.

857
00:58:38,052 --> 00:58:39,887
My grandfather
grew up on a plantation...-

858
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,957
First came to the United States
as a student.

859
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:44,759
Through Ellis Island.

860
00:58:44,792 --> 00:58:46,293
To be with the love of my life.

861
00:58:46,327 --> 00:58:47,762
Through an arranged marriage.

862
00:58:47,795 --> 00:58:49,263
I started getting

863
00:58:49,296 --> 00:58:50,798
- a whole bunch of odd jobs.
- I've been married for

864
00:58:50,831 --> 00:58:52,666
- 33 years.
- I was an insurance agent.

865
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,101
- Salesman, working call center.
- And we have two daughters.

866
00:58:54,135 --> 00:58:55,269
To travel with
the United States military.

867
00:58:55,302 --> 00:58:57,872
I was a model in Milan, Italy.

868
00:58:57,905 --> 00:58:59,040
- And then I married.
- I was a lead singer

869
00:58:59,073 --> 00:59:00,641
in a rock band

870
00:59:00,674 --> 00:59:01,942
- alongside my office job.
- I personally

871
00:59:01,976 --> 00:59:03,144
- have worked as a dance teacher.
- I did acting

872
00:59:03,177 --> 00:59:04,011
when I was one year old.

01:03:17,164 --> 01:03:18,198
Hello?

896
01:03:21,569 --> 01:03:22,570
Hello?

897
01:04:01,008 --> 01:04:02,409
What are you doing?

898
01:04:05,245 --> 01:04:06,313
Are you there?

899
01:04:07,181 --> 01:04:08,115
[laughs]

900
01:04:08,415 --> 01:04:11,619
So, this is how it ends.

901
01:04:11,653 --> 01:04:12,853
Ayar...

902
01:04:14,955 --> 01:04:16,190
This is not you.

903
01:04:16,658 --> 01:04:17,925
You have no idea

904
01:04:18,526 --> 01:04:20,562
how much you mean to me.

905
01:04:21,395 --> 01:04:23,030
