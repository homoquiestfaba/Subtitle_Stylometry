1
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:12,832
Oh, God!

2
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,731
What?

3
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:17,031
Didn't you see that?

4
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,037
There was a dead cat...

5
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,663
hanging from that sign
we just passed.

6
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,640
Really? Cool.

7
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,009
Don't you even think
about going back there.

8
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:28,673
What color was it?

9
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:29,909
Tiger-striped.

10
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:31,041
What difference
does it make?

11
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,279
Well, I thought it might
be black, you know?

12
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,150
Satanists out in the desert.

13
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:40,156
Marielle said the Nevada desert
was full of oddballs.

14
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,031
I just don't know who could kill
a living creature like that.

15
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,193
You're traveling through
another dimension...

16
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:52,295
A dimension not only
of sight and sound, but of mind.

17
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,737
Very funny.

18
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,203
I can't wait to get back
to Salt Lake City, at least.

19
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,180
Too much nature out here.

20
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:05,013
I'm starting to miss civilization.

21
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:06,211
What? What is it?

22
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:09,688
A car. Really movin', too.

23
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:12,850
Get over.
Give him the road.

24
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,590
It's a cop.

25
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:20,658
Why is he going so fast
with his flashers off?

26
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,100
Who's he gonna
run them for out here?

27
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,263
Well, there's us.

28
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:31,599
What's he doing?

29
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,271
I don't know.

30
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,255
Hi.

31
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,048
What does he want?

32
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,381
Well, I guess he wants
to get back behind us again.

33
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,318
Well, why didn't
he just pull over...

34
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,912
and let us pass then,
if that's what he wants?

35
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,320
I don't know.

36
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,763
Why is he stopping us,
Peter? Why?

37
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,598
These asses have
a quota to make.

38
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,798
They keep the posted limit at 55
so they can make it.

39
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,806
Don't pull over.

40
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,307
I don't have a choice, Mary.

41
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,912
Great.

42
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:59,331
Holy God, it's Sasquatch!

43
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,171
Guess I was going
a little fast, officer.

44
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,640
Had the hammer
down a little, huh?

45
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,043
Can I see your registration
please, sir?

46
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,674
No problem.

47
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,520
But the car's not mine.

48
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:22,612
It's my sister's.

49
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:26,250
We're driving it back
for her to New York.

50
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,988
She's... she goes
to school in Oregon.

51
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,120
Rand College.

52
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,528
Have you ever heard of it?

53
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,491
Mar, could you get
the registration?

54
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,968
I think it's in
the glove compartment.

55
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,528
I don't believe this...

56
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,062
I can't find my license.

57
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,640
Sorry, officer, I...

58
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,407
Oh, wait a minute, here it is.

59
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:52,317
OK, and, um, here's
the registration.

60
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,478
Oh, good.

61
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,918
I see you're
an organ donor.

62
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:58,652
Think that's wise?

63
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:02,351
Well...

64
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:13,001
Is there a problem, officer?

65
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,475
Your name is Jackson?

66
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:20,468
The one on the pink slip
says Deirdre Finney.

67
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,342
That your sister?

68
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,680
Right.

69
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,207
She's been divorced
for about a year...

70
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,777
but she kept
her husband's last name.

71
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,721
Deirdre's a bit of a flake.

72
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,482
Bit of a flake, huh?

73
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,084
Tak.

74
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,390
Can I ask you to step
out of the car, Mr. Jackson?

75
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:42,526
What for?

76
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,596
Of course.

77
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,715
Come around back, Mr. Jackson.

78
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,882
Hell!

79
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,085
Peter, what is it?

80
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:10,095
Our...
our damn license plate fell off!

81
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:11,653
I doubt it.

82
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,063
Did you stop in Fallon?

83
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,365
Yeah, we got gas
at the Conoco there.

84
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:18,802
Why?

85
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:21,773
They got some
light-fingered kids hang out there.

86
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:27,110
I reckon your license plate
is hangin' in their clubhouse right now.

87
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:29,444
You know this and
it still goes on?

88
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,643
Oh, Fallon is not my place.

89
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,915
Those are not my ways.
Gosh, no.

90
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:39,248
What should
we do about that, officer?

91
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,226
Well, you just take
the plate off the front...

92
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,386
and put it in the back.

93
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:43,417
That's should get you
across the country.

94
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,760
You got a tool kit?

95
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,759
These are yours.

96
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,233
Thanks.

97
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:51,259
I think I saw a tool kit
in the trunk.

98
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,828
Yeah, OK.

99
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,674
There, behind
my make-up case.

100
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:13,884
Hey.

101
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:16,053
What is this?

102
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,657
Damned sister!

103
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,066
Officer, I know what
this looks like.

104
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,630
But we checked her stuff...

105
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,865
But we're not
customs officers!

106
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,703
That... that is not our dope!

107
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:29,969
No.

108
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,551
Let me have your keys.

109
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,330
Get in the car.

110
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,629
But...

111
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,728
Are you deaf?
Get in the car!

112
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,898
Get in the car!

113
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,144
OK, we'll get this
taken care of.

114
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,078
In Desperation.

115
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,048
Get in the car, folks.

116
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,379
Tak.

117
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,405
Slow down,
you'll flip us!

118
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:23,321
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

119
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,721
Officer, you saw
our registration.

120
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,063
You know that isn't our car,
and it's not our dope either!

121
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,068
Do you think
we'd be so stupid...

122
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:39,435
Shut up, you
New York deviant.

123
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,635
Wh... wh... what
did you call me?

124
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,508
I'm arresting you
for possession of marijuana...

125
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,535
with intent to sell.

126
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,707
You can't be serious!

127
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,307
You have the right
to remain silent.

128
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,443
If you choose
to not be silent...

129
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,181
everything you say
can be held against you...

130
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:56,711
In a court of law.

131
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:57,848
You have the right
to an attorney.

132
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,289
I am going to kill you.

133
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,020
If you cannot
afford an attorney...

134
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,823
One will be
provided for you.

135
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:03,954
Do you understand
your rights...

136
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,157
as I have explained them
to you?

137
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,468
Do you understand
your rights?

138
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,267
Just... Act normally.

139
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,296
I don't think he understands
what he just said.

140
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,707
Do you understand your rights?!

141
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:20,211
Do you or not?
Answer me...

142
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:23,579
you smart-aleck blue state
unisex swingles!

143
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:27,108
Do you or not?
Do you or not?

144
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,018
Yes! Yes,
we understand.

145
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,046
Please, just watch the road.

146
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,661
Don't worry about me.

147
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,687
I got eyes in the back
of my head.

148
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,528
You'd do well
to remember that.

149
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:02,184
Up there on the horizon's
the china pit.

150
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,019
Gotta go
all the way to Peru

151
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,490
to find a bigger one.

152
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,558
Yeah, we just started
working her again.

153
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:13,190
They got some kind
of technology...

154
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,723
that makes even
the tailings valuable.

155
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:18,328
Science, huh?

156
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,894
Gosh.

157
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,266
Yeah, I think we're gonna
be a boom town again...

158
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,537
just like in the old days.

159
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:46,881
Officer, please don't kill us.

160
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,793
We'll do whatever you say.
Just don't kill us!

161
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,491
Shut your quackin'
yuppie pothead mouth!

162
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,089
We're not potheads.

163
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,795
You look like potheads to me.

164
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,868
Yuppies killed
Princess Di, you know.

165
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,669
Wasn't she beautiful?

166
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:03,902
Officer...

167
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:06,138
Shut up and walk.

168
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,975
Where is everybody?

169
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,571
Disneyland.

170
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,778
Come on, walk,
hay foot, straw foot.

171
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,712
You're Peter.

172
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,780
You're Mary.

173
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,792
So where's Paul?

174
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:23,454
<i>I mean, how can you sing
Puff the Magic Dragon</i>

175
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,895
without Paul?

176
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,034
Wait a minute.
Peter Jackson.

177
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:35,268
<i>I love Lord of the Rings!</i>

178
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,776
You are useless.

179
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,870
You at least look healthy.

180
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:42,574
Get in there, girlfriend.

181
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:53,789
Forgot all about her.

182
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:57,227
You can never remember
everything, now can you?

183
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:02,796
I don't care if you're
a Jew, a Hindu, or Mr. Magoo.

184
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,860
In Desperation...

185
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,738
We don't care about
those things much.

186
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:22,109
Peter!

187
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,554
Peter! Let me go!

188
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,785
Peter!

189
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,028
Shotgun, get the shotgun!

190
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,053
Shoot him, shoot him!

191
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,998
Get it!
Get it, woman!

192
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,968
Pick it up,
for God sakes!

193
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,094
Don't do that.

194
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,077
Drop it, Mary.

195
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,745
Put it down, Mary.

196
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,516
Put it down.

197
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,250
Drop it.

198
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,295
Now, if you don't
want to see your liver...

199
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,638
come squirting
out of your nose...

200
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,165
I'd put it down, Mary.

201
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,785
Kill me if you're going to.

202
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,762
Now, why would
I want to kill you...

203
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,792
when things are
just starting to get interesting?

204
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,609
He killed my husband!

205
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,703
He killed our little girl.

206
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,648
Three billion red Chinese
don't give a damn.

207
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,548
How they hangin', old timer?

208
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:10,593
Don't you hurt him!
I'm warning you.

209
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,062
Who are you, boy?

210
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:14,622
I'm David Carver.

211
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:18,864
I live at 248 Poplar Street
in Wentworth, Ohio.

212
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,537
Yeah, but...

213
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,373
who made thee?

214
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,546
Canst thou say
who made thee? Tak!

215
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:35,453
I guess my folks did.

216
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,681
And God.

217
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:42,653
There's no god
out here, little Dave.

218
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:45,663
Leave him alone!

219
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:48,029
Haven't you done
enough to our family?

220
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,900
Even bald-headed
hoppin'- Satan...

221
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:54,770
don't step his split-foot
much west of Tonopah.

222
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,900
This is Desperation.

223
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,436
Only thing out here
is can tah and can tak.

224
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:04,909
And don't you forget it!

225
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,796
You're mine.

226
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,742
David, what's wrong?

227
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,079
What's... what's
wrong with him?

228
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:45,079
There's nothing
wrong with him.

229
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,648
What do you mean?
Are you blind?

230
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,922
I think your son
is praying.

231
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:30,226
Well. Hey there.

232
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,703
Are you a nice person?

233
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,204
Well, I like to think so...

234
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:38,072
but, then again,
if I was Ted Bundy...

235
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,441
do you think I'd tell you?

236
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:42,470
I'd know.
I got a psychic streak.

237
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,541
Up yours!

238
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,053
That's pleasant.

239
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,885
So what's your name,
young lady?

240
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,221
Cynthia Smith.

241
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:56,557
Smith? Oh. Smith.
That's a likely story.

242
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,688
No, really, it is.

243
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,890
Sure.

244
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,092
Honest!

245
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,122
OK.

246
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,566
Who are you?

247
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:08,471
Me? Steve Ames.
A noble moniker.

248
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:12,807
So, haul your psychic
streak on up here...

249
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:13,833
Cynthia Smith...

250
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,110
And let's make
some miles, OK?

251
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,083
Yeah, I guess you'll do.

252
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:22,848
Oh. Well, thank you
very much, cookie.

253
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,221
Don't call me cookie,
and I won't call you cake.

254
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,724
Oh, my.

255
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:38,831
You gonna smoke that
or gum it to death?

256
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,702
Yeah, I quit.

257
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,971
Never hurts to keep
in practice, though.

258
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,015
What you lookin' at, huh?

259
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,613
Your T-shirt.

260
00:20:58,657 --> 00:20:59,624
Yeah, right!

261
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,023
I'm lookin' at your t-shirt!

262
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,050
Come on, that's OK!
We're all animals, right?

263
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,563
Oh, come on, now!
Give me a break.

264
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:10,296
<i>I worked with Dylan back in '95
when, uh, he did Unplugged.</i>

265
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:11,302
No way!

266
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:12,394
Yeah, yeah way. Yeah.

267
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,997
I was doin' amps
and guitar tech...

268
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,302
back in those days.

269
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:17,740
Are you a roadie?

270
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,244
Well, this truck looks too small
to carry a band's gear.

271
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,406
No, I'm workin'
for this writer...

272
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,540
And he's, uh, he's driving
cross country...

273
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,450
doing little speaking things,
you know?

274
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,511
And he does one
every couple of days or so...

275
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:31,522
and when he gets back
to the west coast...

276
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,080
he's gonna write a book about it.

277
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,558
Is he famous?

278
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:38,654
Have you ever heard of
John Edward Marinville?

279
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,631
No.

280
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:45,501
Well, he's famous
amongst book people, I guess.

281
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:48,301
Yeah, I pretty much
stick with Dean Koontz.

282
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:52,469
Is he cool?

283
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:54,445
Is he cool? Yeah...

284
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,776
you know, once you
get past the ego...

285
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,282
which is like,
the size of Tibet.

286
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,650
Yeah, I mean, he gets cranky
every so often, but I like him...

287
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:02,711
you know.

288
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,482
People drive across
country everyday.

289
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:07,549
Why is he writing
a book about it?

290
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:11,528
Ah, well, it's like he's got
this midlife crisis thing...

291
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,554
You know, the guy's 60 years old.

292
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:17,864
He's been everywhere,
he's done everyone, you know.

293
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:21,236
The guy rides a big
Harley soft tail.

294
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:24,140
Hey, hey! Is his bike
red and cream?

295
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,143
Yeah, red and cream.

296
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,144
I think I saw him
this morning!

297
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,406
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you probably did.

298
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:28,913
Lookin' all handsome
on his bike.

299
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:30,278
Handsome man, yeah!

300
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:32,180
Yeah, and he knows
it, too, believe me.

301
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:33,309
Well, he's got
to be what...

302
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,319
like, 50, 70 miles ahead of you.

303
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,945
Yeah, about that.

304
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:38,182
You know, I catch up to him
when he has a gig...

305
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:41,351
And I set up the sound systems
for him...

306
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:42,587
And I, you know...

307
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:45,892
Make sure he's got
the names straight, stuff like that.

308
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,832
And I'll have dinner with him
if he wants somebody to talk to.

309
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,335
Not with, to.

310
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,998
But the guy's having the time
of his life.

311
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,473
Yeah, he likes to play
the lone wolf, huh?

312
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:59,136
Yeah. That's...
that's the boss.

313
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:01,407
<i>Lone Wolf McQuade.</i>

314
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,175
A film before your time.

315
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:24,958
Come on, come on. Go.

316
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,596
Water in the desert.

317
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,635
Thank you, Lord.

318
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:48,252
You want to
come up here, sir?

319
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:51,380
I think we need
to have a talk.

320
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:54,153
Afternoon, officer.

321
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:00,428
A wise man once told me...

322
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,695
no matter how much
you squirm and dance...

323
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:05,703
last two drops end up
in your pants.

324
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:10,400
Sir. Are you aware
that parking your vehicle

325
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,342
on a state road
is against the law?

326
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:16,211
And that relieving
yourself in public...

327
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,682
is also against the law?

328
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:24,179
Well, I didn't see any crowd
gathering to watch me, so...

329
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:25,280
Sir.

330
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:28,087
Yeah. Well,
listen, you can...

331
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:29,286
write me up
if you have to...

332
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:33,821
and I will take it with a smile
and apologize...

333
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,423
if that will
improve your day.

334
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,731
I'm not gonna
write you up, sir.

335
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:40,033
Just a warning
will do this time, but...

336
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,072
What?

337
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,671
Something wrong?

338
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,382
Holy God.

339
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,053
Holy God!

340
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:02,992
You're John Edward Marinville,
aren't you?

341
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,996
- Oh, I...
- Damn!

342
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,861
I'm busted.
You got me again.

343
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,763
Damn!

344
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,767
Glad to meet you.

345
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:10,768
I am shaking hands

346
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,861
<i>With the guy who wrote Delight!</i>

347
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,201
Yeah.

348
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,104
<i>With the guy who wrote
Song of the Hammer!</i>

349
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,403
- Yeah.
- This is...

350
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:19,569
Wow!

351
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,578
What are you
doing out here?

352
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,176
And on such an unsafe
mode of transportation?

353
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,186
I mean, they don't
call them murder-cycles for nothin'...

354
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,983
and I'm a wolf.

355
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:33,252
Are you workin'
on anything new, sir?

356
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:36,787
Yeah, a book of essays.

357
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:39,023
I thought I'd cycle
across America...

358
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,725
and get in touch
with the common folk.

359
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,632
You know,
get back to my roots.

360
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:45,465
That's amazing.

361
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:50,372
Sir, can I
can I have your autograph?

362
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,878
I mean, that'd... that'd...
that'd make my whole day.

363
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,039
Hell, that'd make
my whole year.

364
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:58,072
Yeah, that'd be fine.
Right here and?

365
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,107
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- All right.

366
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:04,554
Could you just make it out
to Collie Entragian...

367
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:08,116
your number one fan.

368
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,683
Thank you.

369
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:14,829
I heard you saw some
pretty hairy stuff in the 'Nam.

370
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:17,528
I was just
a correspondent, officer.

371
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:21,437
Just one more
ink-stained wretch.

372
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,634
But, I must say...

373
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:26,769
that the Vietnam experience
defined me.

374
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,006
Nobody wrote about
'Nam like you.

375
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,174
I heard you saved some soldiers...

376
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:34,185
when some suicide gook
blew up a restaurant.

377
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:41,252
Well, it was gut check time
for a lot of us.

378
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:42,520
We did what we could.

379
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,529
Yeah, well, some people
don't do anything.

380
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:47,724
Some made the bread
of forgetfulness...

381
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:50,326
and drank the wine
of cowardice. Tak.

382
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:58,305
Hey, you don't want to ride around
like that, Mr. Marinville.

383
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,538
That thing gets caught
up in your back wheel...

384
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:01,545
you're toast.

385
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:04,309
How'd that get like that?

386
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,407
It can't be.

387
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,783
I always check these buckles
before I get on the cycle.

388
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,310
It's the last thing I do.

389
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,847
Well, they say the memory's
the first thing to go.

390
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,951
What's that
supposed to mean?

391
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,731
What the hell is that?

392
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:32,138
That's a wolf!
Shoot it!

393
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:35,169
Ah, that's just a wild dog.

394
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,908
They're not dangerous.

395
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,850
Ordinarily.

396
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,010
Tak!

397
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,344
Tak ah lah!

398
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,720
Tak ah wah!

399
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:52,287
What the hell
did you say to it?

400
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:55,629
Is that some kind
of Indian dialect?

401
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:57,897
Well, it's a lot
older than that.

402
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:04,305
Now, since you can't
take care of yourself...

403
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,071
You big baby...

404
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:09,970
Hey.

405
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:12,979
Gosh.

406
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,849
Houston, we have a problem.

407
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:19,879
That's not mine.

408
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,892
You put that in there
when I was off doing my business.

409
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,257
Yeah.

410
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:27,094
Blame the cop, just like in
your letty New York stories.

411
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:28,121
Tak.

412
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:31,626
Why do you keep
saying that?

413
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:33,534
Why do you keep
saying "tak"?

414
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:36,301
I didn't say tak.
You said tak.

415
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:41,108
You say tomato,
I say tomat-oh.

416
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:44,877
You say potato,
I say potat-ah.

417
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,281
What the hell's
the matter with you?

418
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:47,909
Tomato...

419
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,283
Tomat-oh.

420
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:52,216
Potato.

421
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:54,384
Potat-oh.

422
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:57,053
## Let's call
the whole thing off ##

423
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:02,563
My nose!

424
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:05,763
That's not all I'll break.

425
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:10,333
My children of the desert.

426
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:14,038
Can toi.

427
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:17,275
What music they make.

428
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,347
Get up!

429
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:22,546
On your feet, Lord Jim.

430
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:25,385
Upsa-daisy, you
worthless piece of crap.

431
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:27,948
You've been redefined.

432
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,425
Watch what you're
doing to me.

433
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,427
Shut up!

434
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:32,429
You're in my house now!

435
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:34,192
You're in the house
of the wolf and the scorpion...

436
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:35,597
and don't you forget it!

437
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:41,369
You really did wet
your pants this time.

438
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,208
You're a sorry excuse
for a writer...

439
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:54,651
and you're a sorry
excuse for a man.

440
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,381
Your whole life is a lie...

441
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,616
and I could just kill
you right here.

442
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,187
Yes.

443
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,220
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

444
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,724
No. No. No. No.

445
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,203
It's still showing.

446
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:21,705
I can still see it.

447
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:23,434
Cover it up more!

448
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:26,170
More, please.

449
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,837
Yes.

450
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,581
Thank you for using Sky.

451
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,110
Your call is now
being routed.

452
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:38,213
Have a great day.

453
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:39,280
Oh, damn it.

454
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:45,929
I was in a literary commune
in Chicago.

455
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,864
Yeah, that's
a new one on me.

456
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:49,389
Well, when you have
a bunch of people...

457
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:50,594
sitting around
in a roach motel...

458
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,126
smoking crystal meth,
they're addicts.

459
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:54,570
- Nice.
- But!

460
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:57,165
If they've been to college,
they're a literary commune.

461
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:58,470
For a while, though,
it wasn't bad...

462
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:01,569
But then I realized
I was getting old before my time.

463
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:03,773
So, I split.

464
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:05,908
OK, all right...

465
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,941
Do me a favor.
Just don't say anything, OK?

466
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,454
He's... he'll
be cool about it.

467
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,183
But his agent
made a huge stink...

468
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:15,886
about picking up,
wayward hitchhikers.

469
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,993
Hey, boss, that you?

470
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,225
Steve...
Steve, I'm...

471
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:22,459
Johnny?

472
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,899
Boss, is that...

473
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,368
Trouble...

474
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:28,600
I hear you, boss.
What's wrong?

475
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,374
Boss?

476
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,379
About a mile and...
about a mile and a half...

477
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,608
Boss?

478
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:43,145
Boss? Boss!

479
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,814
Steve...

480
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,289
Boss? Boss?!

481
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,588
Steve, can you...
can you hear me? S...

482
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:51,117
S...
Shoot.

483
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:53,794
Lost him.

484
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,135
Miss me?

485
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:53,188
Where you taking me?

486
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:56,489
The old calabozo,
my friend...

487
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:59,360
Where anything you bray
will be abused against you...

488
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,797
in the court of caw.

489
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:13,066
Well, aren't you going
to at least say gesundheit?

490
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:19,309
He's in trouble isn't he?

491
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,143
Said something
about the cops.

492
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:23,949
Oh, God.

493
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:24,977
Bad.

494
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:26,580
Not good.

495
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,683
Big ego. Big temper.

496
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:33,095
Just hope he hasn't
killed anybody.

497
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,929
All right,
brace yourself, Cynthia.

498
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,265
There might be blood.

499
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,792
Yeah, I will.

500
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:41,236
I'm a woman.

501
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:42,762
I can deal with blood.

502
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,085
Look, John.

503
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,918
What in the name of God
is going on?

504
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,366
What's up
with the praying, David?

505
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:16,134
I've been doing it since
Bryan's accident.

506
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:18,768
Everyone thought he'd die.

507
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:20,299
Your sister died.

508
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,936
I'd say that's
a pretty lousy bargain.

509
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,139
Honey, leave him alone...

510
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,478
I want to know about this!

511
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,641
He's praying.
That's all.

512
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,980
He's not hurting
anybody.

513
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,144
Praying is great.

514
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,212
Without it, the crusades would've
never gotten off the ground.

515
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:33,189
Do you do this
all the time, son?

516
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:34,316
Or is it special?

517
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:38,124
I ask for help in the morning
and give thanks at night.

518
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:40,289
In the middle I just
take a few minutes...

519
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,060
and try to...

520
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,794
get open.

521
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:46,894
Sort of like a football
receiver or something.

522
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:49,406
It's hard to explain.

523
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,408
Bryan got you going on this?

524
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:54,275
Bryan's accident.

525
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:55,836
You remember
the doctor saying...

526
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,576
how his recovery was
almost miraculous?

527
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,545
I saw him, Mom.

528
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:03,842
It wasn't "almost. "

529
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:13,353
Bryan, look out!

530
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,100
Bryan!

531
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:23,436
Bryan!

532
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:33,116
Bryan, are you OK?

533
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:39,152
Bryan, are you...

534
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:45,019
Help me! Somebody help me!

535
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:46,620
I think he's dying!

536
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,091
Come on, please.

537
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,801
God, please don't
let him die.

538
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:58,568
If you save him,
I'll do something for you.

539
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:02,111
Anything you want,
I promise.

540
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,044
Only don't let him die.

541
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:08,846
Please don't let him die.

542
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,051
God could work a miracle
on your friend...

543
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:14,421
but not on your baby sister?

544
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:17,757
He couldn't save her
from that cop?

545
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,090
What kind of a god is that?

546
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,828
I don't know what kind
of god he is.

547
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:24,892
Look, leave him alone.

548
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:26,197
I want to know how you
can get on your knees...

549
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:28,762
and pray to a god
who killed your sister!

550
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,001
Lady, he's your son...

551
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,203
and I don't mean
to interfere.

552
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:36,042
But why don't you take
it easy on the boy?

553
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,446
I know you lost
your little girl.

554
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,006
I lost my husband.

555
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:42,178
It's been a tough day
on everyone.

556
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:43,652
Tough day.

557
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,118
Listen.

558
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,720
Maybe it's help.

559
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:54,663
No. It's Collie.

560
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,860
I recognize the engine.

561
00:38:56,901 --> 00:39:00,564
His name is
Collie Entragian.

562
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,241
He's been on the force
here for...

563
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:07,574
about 12 years.

564
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:09,875
I'm... I'm the vet
in these parts...

565
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:13,213
and I took care of
Collie's dogs.

566
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,241
He was a nice fellow.

567
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:16,583
Yeah, a real sweetheart.

568
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,588
Till this, I mean.

569
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:20,920
I'll tell you
something, though.

570
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,793
He's bigger.

571
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,456
What do you mean,
"he's bigger"?

572
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:27,464
Bigger.

573
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:29,227
Taller.

574
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:31,632
A few inches at least.

575
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:33,762
That's impossible.

576
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:36,295
I know.

577
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,974
Look at us, would you.

578
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:48,143
Just one big happy family.

579
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:50,153
Tak.

580
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:04,299
I don't even know
what I'm looking for.

581
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:05,632
His bike...

582
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:09,571
Skid marks, or just anything
out of the ordinary.

583
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:12,940
- Wait, wait... what is that?
- What?

584
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,878
He said something about an R.V.

585
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,574
Hey!

586
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:19,048
What? What is it?

587
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,245
Just a reflection,
I guess. Go slow.

588
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,315
Hello?

589
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:57,418
Anybody home?

590
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:00,015
Look.

591
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:02,792
This is some little
girl's favorite.

592
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:04,886
See how the dress
is patched?

593
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:06,760
So why was it left
in the sand?

594
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,299
Yeah. And why...

595
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:16,971
Why are all the tires flat, you know?

596
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:20,067
Like, not just one or two
of them, but all of them.

597
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:59,077
Eeny, meeny, miney, mo.

598
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,745
Catch a tourist by the toe.

599
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,225
Don't you scream.

600
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,702
Don't you shout.

601
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,974
Time has come

602
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:29,537
to take you... out.

603
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,638
Leave them alone!

604
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:33,383
Haven't you done
enough to us?

605
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:34,884
In a word...

606
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:35,886
No.

607
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,718
Come on out, hon.

608
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:41,816
Or this no chin,
pencil neck, paper pusher...

609
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:43,850
gets it right
between the eyes.

610
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:49,326
Ellie, no.

611
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:50,697
And the boy goes next.

612
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,531
No!

613
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:02,905
I'll be all right.

614
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:04,676
OK.

615
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:08,618
That's right, hon.

616
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:10,415
Fine as fiddlesticks.

617
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:17,891
If you want that...

618
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,759
take me where my son
won't have to see.

619
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:21,162
Oh, don't worry, hon.

620
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:23,689
I don't want "that. "

621
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:26,396
Especially not from "you. "

622
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,504
Mom, no!

623
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,598
Leave her alone,
you bastard!

624
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:31,938
Leave my mother alone.

625
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:34,069
Don't worry, honey.
I'll be back. OK?

626
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:38,108
Make him stop.
Dad, make him stop.

627
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:40,116
Oh, God.

628
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,785
I'm warning you.

629
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:47,052
If you hurt her, you'll be sorry.

630
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:49,389
Maybe.

631
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:51,018
But I doubt it.

632
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:55,461
You're just a little
prayboy, aren't you?

633
00:43:55,499 --> 00:43:57,558
Yes, yes, you are.

634
00:43:57,601 --> 00:44:01,560
You just little prayboy
in a baseball shirt.

635
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:04,733
Well, go ahead and pray.

636
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:06,504
See what good it does.

637
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:09,512
But God ain't here
any more than he was...

638
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:13,448
when Jesus was dying
on the cross with flies in his eyes.

639
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:14,473
Tak!

640
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:20,652
Tak! Ah lah!

641
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,920
Him en tow!

642
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:31,096
If you set a hand
or a foot outside your cell...

643
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:33,126
he'll have it off before you
even know it was gone.

644
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,228
Leave her alone.

645
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:35,966
Son!

646
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,566
I will put a stick through
your mother and spin her...

647
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:41,578
until she catches fire
if I so desire.

648
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:43,011
And you'll not stop me.

649
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,005
And I'll come back for you.

650
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:50,315
Collie!

651
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:53,983
Don't hurt her!

652
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,760
Carver. Carver.

653
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:26,713
Well, there was boy here
as well as a girl.

654
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:30,818
David Carver. Carver.

655
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:32,692
What do you got?

656
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:33,856
Jewelry.

657
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,296
Earrings and rings.

658
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:37,857
You know, not Tiffany,
but not cheap either.

659
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,198
Not the kind of stuff
you'd leave behind...

660
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,329
unless you were in a hurry.

661
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:46,131
Time for the cops, isn't it?

662
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:48,144
Well, I'm pretty sure
the boss said something...

663
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:49,941
about being like
a mile from the R.V.

664
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,039
So...

665
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:54,050
Before we start
yelling for the cops...

666
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:21,605
You're crazy.

667
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:02,775
Cynthia!

668
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:59,169
Why are you
taking me here?!

669
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,216
It's beautiful, isn't it?

670
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:32,403
Oh, God.

671
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:33,807
Please, don't kill me.

672
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:36,839
Just...

673
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,927
Now what?

674
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:56,262
Well, there's a town
not too far far east of here...

675
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,131
Desperation.

676
00:48:58,168 --> 00:48:59,692
They got some cute names
out here, don't they?

677
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:01,533
Yeah, I don't
care about the name.

678
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:03,835
I just care about if they have
at least one working phone...

679
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:06,206
and maybe
one working cop.

680
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:08,438
Yeah.
Wouldn't that be nice.

681
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:40,607
## Mother Mary ##

682
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,202
## What's the story ##

683
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:45,578
## Save my soul
from Purgatory ##

684
00:49:58,695 --> 00:49:59,787
Pie.

685
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:04,430
Murder God.

686
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:06,766
That's what it really says.

687
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:15,943
Pie, I'm sorry
he killed you.

688
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:17,810
Never mind.

689
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,611
I have something for you.

690
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:23,013
Tak ah lah!

691
00:50:23,053 --> 00:50:25,453
Tak!

692
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:31,522
Look, David.

693
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:48,535
David, are you OK?

694
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,512
Could you
please turn around?

695
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:54,983
This is a little
embarrassing.

696
00:50:57,854 --> 00:50:59,822
David, whatever
you have in mind...

697
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:02,051
It can't be a good idea.

698
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:03,081
It's the only idea.

699
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:04,423
Who says so, son?

700
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:06,622
My sister...

701
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:07,652
God.

702
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:12,859
Are you going to stop this...

703
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,701
before you son does
something he regrets?

704
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,036
David, you don't
have to do this.

705
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,474
The cop's bleeding out.
He can't last much longer.

706
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:20,908
It won't take him long...

707
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:23,344
to kill my mom
if decides to.

708
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,543
David, I don't know
what you're planning...

709
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,210
But I forbid it.

710
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,377
Sorry, Dad.

711
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:33,912
What's he doing?

712
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:48,098
David! David,
you don't have to do this.

713
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:49,730
You'll get stuck.

714
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:53,269
Even if you do get out,

715
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,039
That thing'll eat you
from the feet up.

716
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:58,241
Lord, close its mouth
like you did with the lions...

717
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,841
When Daniel was cast
into their den.

718
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:04,085
Amen.

719
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:08,387
Stop it!

720
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:10,723
Get away from him
you ugly bastard.

721
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,284
Here, here. Here! Here!

722
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,388
Hey! Hey, come on!

723
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:15,557
Get over here,
you mutt.

724
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,728
Come to me!
Come to me!

725
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,203
Come on,
take another bite!

726
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:29,373
Come this way!
Come to me!

727
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:39,714
David, there's no time!
Come on, move!

728
00:52:40,857 --> 00:52:42,757
Get out of there, David!

729
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:45,260
David, pull it!
Get out of there!

730
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:49,756
Come on, come on!

731
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:54,927
David, push!

732
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,007
Get out!
Get out!

733
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,938
Call the police!

734
00:53:04,981 --> 00:53:07,677
Run, run, David!

735
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,232
Please help me
take care of my mom...

736
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:31,604
and do what
I'm supposed to do.

737
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,460
Hello?

738
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:28,358
Anybody home?

739
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,468
Tasteful.

740
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:41,170
Operators are standing by.

741
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:43,008
Hello?! Anybody there?

742
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:44,707
It's dead!

743
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:45,715
It's got to be the...

744
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,080
Hey, wait! Wait! Wait!

745
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,483
Wait.

746
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:53,216
There are some garbage cans
lined up against the wall.

747
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:54,951
The wind just knocked
one down. That's all.

748
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:56,356
I don't care.
I want to get out of here.

749
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:58,827
This place is empty,
and it gives me the creeps.

750
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:01,126
There's trucks out there.

751
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:03,098
Where is everybody?

752
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,532
I don't know.
But I just think...

753
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:05,898
we ought to just keep...

754
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:06,993
I know, just tell me...

755
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:08,368
we're going to be
laughing at each other...

756
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:10,339
and feeling stupid
in a few seconds. OK?

757
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:13,001
OK. A few seconds.

758
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:14,874
Good enough.

759
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:17,141
Let's see what we see.

760
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:21,215
Do you hear that?

761
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:23,776
Sounds like a kid blowing
bubbles through a straw.

762
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,479
Do not worry, Little Nell,

763
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:29,651
for I shall save you.

764
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,854
Dork.

765
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:33,829
Yeah.

766
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:47,240
It's just an aquarium.

767
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:54,710
No, look.

768
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:57,414
Look.

769
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:58,614
What?

770
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:03,483
Behind the boat.
