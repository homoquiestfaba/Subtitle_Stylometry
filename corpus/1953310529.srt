1
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:05,688
You just tell me when
you're rolling.

2
00:00:05,723 --> 00:00:09,082
We're rolling.

3
00:00:09,148 --> 00:00:11,050
A lot of people--

4
00:00:11,117 --> 00:00:14,755
have questioned
what really happened.

5
00:00:14,822 --> 00:00:18,258
And when the novel
was first published,

6
00:00:18,325 --> 00:00:20,494
it didn't take long

7
00:00:20,561 --> 00:00:24,164
for there to be even
more questions asked.

8
00:00:24,231 --> 00:00:26,667
It's always
remained a mystery.

9
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:29,269
And that's why
I wanted to thank you

10
00:00:29,336 --> 00:00:31,672
for coming
in to meet with us.

11
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:37,946
To help shed some
light on the events.

12
00:00:38,013 --> 00:00:39,848
Okay.

13
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:42,784
He dedicated
the book to you.

14
00:00:42,851 --> 00:00:44,919
Can you tell us
how much of his novel

15
00:00:44,986 --> 00:00:46,321
was based on fact?

16
00:00:46,388 --> 00:00:47,423
All of it.

17
00:00:48,858 --> 00:00:50,125
It was 1969--

18
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:58,167
What can you tell us
about that summer?

19
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:03,706
Question? What was
the question?

20
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:06,275
What do you remember about that
summer 1969?

21
00:01:06,309 --> 00:01:08,011
It was hot.
It was real hot.

22
00:01:08,078 --> 00:01:10,446
God must have been sweatin',
it was so hot.

23
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:18,722
Tell me about the murder.

24
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,429
Hey, how much, how much I'm gettin'
paid for this?

25
00:01:30,968 --> 00:01:34,272
Well, Sheriff Call
was this evil, nasty,

26
00:01:34,339 --> 00:01:37,408
disgusting son
of a gun.

27
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:48,721
Black people
hated Sheriff Call

28
00:01:48,787 --> 00:01:51,022
because he killed
so many of us

29
00:01:51,089 --> 00:01:53,459
during his two terms
in service.

30
00:02:02,402 --> 00:02:05,270
Some of my family
was included.

31
00:02:05,337 --> 00:02:07,440
White people
feared him too.

32
00:02:14,948 --> 00:02:17,584
So somebody got fed up
with his fat ass, and killed him.

33
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:20,453
That's what happened
that summer.

34
00:02:50,451 --> 00:02:52,154
They say he dragged
his intestines

35
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,222
for a mile
before he died.

36
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:59,895
Crazy white people even
built a statue for him.

37
00:03:02,165 --> 00:03:04,399
How did it come about

38
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:06,869
that you worked
for the Jansens?

39
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,105
I was cleaning
for them part time,

40
00:03:09,172 --> 00:03:11,841
right when his mamma
ran off.

41
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:15,244
And Ward and I,
Ward was his brother,

42
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:17,480
he was in high school
at the time

43
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:19,515
and we raised
him together.

44
00:03:19,582 --> 00:03:22,319
Little Jackie
was five at the time.

45
00:03:22,386 --> 00:03:25,088
Where was his father?

46
00:03:25,154 --> 00:03:27,725
W. W. was just

47
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,393
chasing girls,
you know.

48
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,695
And running
the local newspaper.

49
00:03:31,762 --> 00:03:36,601
The Moat County Tribune.

50
00:03:36,668 --> 00:03:38,335
How's Ward?

51
00:03:38,402 --> 00:03:41,840
He's good, he's good.
Real busy.

52
00:03:41,906 --> 00:03:43,808
Ward was a writer--

53
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:49,047
uh--for the Miami Times.

54
00:03:49,114 --> 00:03:52,484
He used to write
about, uh--

55
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,719
well, he was kind of famous,
you know,

56
00:03:54,786 --> 00:03:58,790
'cause he wrote about the Civil
Rights Movement

57
00:03:58,857 --> 00:04:03,162
and the poor
and the unjustly accused.

58
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:05,897
That's how come
that lady Charlotte

59
00:04:05,965 --> 00:04:07,900
started writing
letters to him.

60
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:10,136
Stuff like that.

61
00:04:10,202 --> 00:04:11,971
Yeah.

62
00:04:12,038 --> 00:04:15,308
And then Jack, like I said,
he was a swimmer.

63
00:04:15,374 --> 00:04:17,777
And, uh--

64
00:04:17,843 --> 00:04:19,578
almost professional,
very close but then

65
00:04:19,645 --> 00:04:21,248
he got kicked
off the swim team,

66
00:04:21,315 --> 00:04:23,717
he got kicked
out of college,

67
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,653
and he came back home to his papa's
house to deliver newspapers.

68
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:30,590
He didn't want
to come back home,

69
00:04:30,657 --> 00:04:32,259
but he didn't have
nowhere else to go.

70
00:04:37,465 --> 00:04:39,633
# Yeah #

71
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,669
# Mmm #

72
00:04:41,736 --> 00:04:43,671
Jack, you better turn
that music down.

73
00:04:43,738 --> 00:04:45,873
You know W. W.
gon' be mad at you.

74
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:51,946
Dang it, Anita, can you
please knock?

75
00:04:52,013 --> 00:04:54,415
I could've been
jerking off in here.

76
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:58,519
Please, it ain't nothing
I ain't seen before.

77
00:04:58,586 --> 00:05:00,321
What are you doing?

78
00:05:00,388 --> 00:05:02,491
I'm picking up your stuff,
like I do every day.

79
00:05:02,558 --> 00:05:05,794
Oh come on, not today.
It's too hot for that.

80
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:07,930
I'm just helping.

81
00:05:07,997 --> 00:05:09,965
You're not helping me.
You don't have to help me.

82
00:05:10,032 --> 00:05:11,434
Come on.

83
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,002
Get off the bed
so I can make it.

84
00:05:13,068 --> 00:05:14,303
Go fix me
some collard greens.

85
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,872
It's my bed.

86
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:18,074
I know it's your bed.
Really?

87
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:21,044
Because it's your bed,
you should fucking make it.

88
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:23,880
They cancelled
"The Smothers Brothers."

89
00:05:23,947 --> 00:05:26,116
Oh, no, that's your show.

90
00:05:26,182 --> 00:05:29,486
Well, I love that show.
I love Dick and I love T ommy.

91
00:05:29,552 --> 00:05:33,823
Lay down. Let me be you for a second.
Oh, yeah, right. Get me in trouble.

92
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:37,461
You want to be me,
I get to be you? Okay.

93
00:05:37,528 --> 00:05:40,698
Okay, I'll love this.
Jack, may I come in?

94
00:05:40,765 --> 00:05:43,401
Oh, good, okay. Go away, go out.
Go back out.

95
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:48,806
Okay. I better start jerking
off first. Okay.

96
00:05:48,873 --> 00:05:51,009
Jack, sorry to interrupt
your masturbation,

97
00:05:51,076 --> 00:05:53,010
but I'm here
to clean the bed!

98
00:05:53,077 --> 00:05:54,945
I could've been jerking off.
I'm gonna clean everything!

99
00:05:55,012 --> 00:05:56,915
I could have
been jerking off!

100
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,916
Get out!
Clean my shit up!

101
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,720
...get all that we
have received in return,

102
00:06:01,787 --> 00:06:04,323
is just another
smooth exercise

103
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:06,558
in political manipulation.
Good girl.

104
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,660
Deceit and deception,

105
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:12,130
callousness and indifference
to our individual problems,

106
00:06:12,197 --> 00:06:15,535
and the disgusting playing
of divisive politics,

107
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:18,204
pitting the young
against the old,

108
00:06:18,271 --> 00:06:21,774
labor against management,
north against south.

109
00:06:21,841 --> 00:06:24,043
Did you want
to see me?

110
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,879
Have you spoken
to Ward this week?

111
00:06:26,946 --> 00:06:29,082
No.
Hello, Jack.

112
00:06:29,148 --> 00:06:31,385
He didn't mention anything to you
about coming here?

113
00:06:31,452 --> 00:06:35,155
I can't believe your father's making
me report on this.

114
00:06:35,222 --> 00:06:37,191
I mean, look at her.

115
00:06:37,257 --> 00:06:39,225
... to open our society.

116
00:06:39,292 --> 00:06:41,895
She plans to run
for president next.

117
00:06:41,962 --> 00:06:45,200
They want to talk
to Hillary Van Wetter.

118
00:06:45,266 --> 00:06:48,469
Don't you let that Pulitzer
Prize fool you.

119
00:06:49,903 --> 00:06:51,339
He don't know
everything yet.

120
00:06:53,073 --> 00:06:56,077
Ain't no reason
to come up here

121
00:06:56,144 --> 00:06:59,146
stirring up shit
with that asshole.

122
00:06:59,213 --> 00:07:02,784
I just wanted to say
that it is very important

123
00:07:02,851 --> 00:07:04,953
for all Americans
to recognize--

124
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:08,356
Charlotte Bless loved
her some dangerous men.

125
00:07:08,423 --> 00:07:10,159
She wrote men in prison.

126
00:07:10,226 --> 00:07:11,861
She finally fell
in love with one.

127
00:07:11,927 --> 00:07:13,995
She was determined
to get him out.

128
00:07:14,062 --> 00:07:16,032
Why y'all ain't got
no ice in here?

129
00:07:16,098 --> 00:07:17,833
You want ice,
go to your house.

130
00:07:17,867 --> 00:07:19,734
Charlotte.

131
00:07:19,801 --> 00:07:21,737
Oh, that's my show.
What you think, Charlotte?

132
00:07:21,771 --> 00:07:23,339
I don't like it.
Make it looser.

133
00:07:23,406 --> 00:07:25,042
That's that nigger
you've been writing?

134
00:07:25,108 --> 00:07:27,009
No. This is
my white man.

135
00:07:27,076 --> 00:07:28,644
Ohhh.

136
00:07:28,711 --> 00:07:32,182
What happened yesterday?
I missed it.

137
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:34,317
Listen to this. He thinks I'm
his angel.

138
00:07:34,383 --> 00:07:37,888
His angel? Shhh.
Shut your face.

139
00:07:37,955 --> 00:07:40,691
Bitch, how old is he?
Oh, my God.

140
00:07:40,757 --> 00:07:44,461
He's a fine motherfucker that's trying to
fuck you. "Ever there was an angel in the world,

141
00:07:44,528 --> 00:07:46,496
"my angel, it must be you,

142
00:07:46,563 --> 00:07:50,301
but no angel would do the things
I dream that you want."

143
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:53,870
Your angel, his angel.

144
00:07:53,937 --> 00:07:56,307
Mm-hm.
That's hot.

145
00:07:56,374 --> 00:08:01,980
He say, "If you truly exist,
I may become a religious man."

146
00:08:02,046 --> 00:08:03,414
Ah!

147
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:11,256
"All my life, my heart has tried
to find a place

148
00:08:11,323 --> 00:08:16,962
I cannot name...a home."

149
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,264
You need to find
yourself a young one.

150
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:20,833
He'll fuck you
real good.

151
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:25,338
He says
I'm his home. Hm.

152
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:27,039
Got a hundred
different men

153
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,974
writing her
from the penitentiary.

154
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,343
That's her man.

155
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,912
Oh, no.
This is my man.

156
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:36,716
This here's the one.

157
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,251
Mm-hm.

158
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,657
Ward came home
to investigate

159
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,160
the conviction
of Hillary Van Wetter.

160
00:08:46,227 --> 00:08:48,628
The town wasn't
too happy about it

161
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,065
and neither was his papa.
Oh, shit. U gh.

162
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:58,072
Ward--

163
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:00,508
there's a horse
in the parking lot.

164
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:02,777
It's our ride
home, Yardley.

165
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:06,448
Uh, where is everybody?

166
00:09:06,515 --> 00:09:08,549
It's Sunday.

167
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:10,986
People's either at home
or at church.

168
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:20,228
It's a shithole.

169
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,675
Hey, man.

170
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,914
Hey, you.

171
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,317
How you doing?

172
00:09:41,384 --> 00:09:43,152
Jack, meet
Yardley Acheman. Hey.

173
00:09:43,219 --> 00:09:45,689
My little brother, Jack.
The swimmer, right?

174
00:09:45,756 --> 00:09:50,227
Yeah, he's our driver now.
Right, good.

175
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,563
Here, let me get these.

176
00:09:54,598 --> 00:09:56,800
That's my typewriter.
You've gotten big, boy.

177
00:09:56,867 --> 00:09:58,435
Just be careful
with the typewriter.

178
00:09:58,502 --> 00:10:01,705
Got all pumped up.
Is that from swimming?

179
00:10:01,772 --> 00:10:03,707
Not anymore.

180
00:10:09,848 --> 00:10:12,751
No! No! No!

181
00:10:12,817 --> 00:10:15,086
Yardley's real particular
about his suits

182
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,088
and his typewriter.
Well, it's very expensive.

183
00:10:21,593 --> 00:10:23,094
Yes. Thank you.

184
00:10:25,331 --> 00:10:28,233
How do I get in?

185
00:10:30,036 --> 00:10:32,505
Watch your head.
Watch your head.

186
00:10:32,571 --> 00:10:35,975
Don't touch my head. Tell him
where you're from, Yardley.

187
00:10:37,143 --> 00:10:38,879
London.

188
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:40,747
Ah!

189
00:10:40,813 --> 00:10:43,049
When I came here--
from New York,

190
00:10:43,115 --> 00:10:46,486
I was interviewing
for the job--

191
00:10:46,553 --> 00:10:49,256
and I was in advertising
in New York

192
00:10:49,323 --> 00:10:53,560
and I mentioned that it was simply
different in New York.

193
00:10:58,432 --> 00:11:00,468
So how'd you get
from New York City

194
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:03,303
to the metropolis
of Lately, Florida?

195
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,008
Jansen residence.

196
00:11:08,075 --> 00:11:11,412
So I came down South and
I interviewed at the paper.

197
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:14,016
W.W., Miss Roberta's
on the phone.

198
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,017
No, no, no.

199
00:11:16,084 --> 00:11:17,719
We don't take
phone calls. Anita...

200
00:11:17,785 --> 00:11:19,321
Who's Miss Roberta?
No calls, Anita.

201
00:11:24,293 --> 00:11:27,162
What part of London
you from, Yardley?

202
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:31,200
Um, all over London.

203
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:33,569
Is there a good dry cleaning here?
Excuse me?

204
00:11:33,637 --> 00:11:36,238
Dry cleaning.

205
00:11:36,305 --> 00:11:38,307
Dry cleaning?
Yes.

206
00:11:38,374 --> 00:11:41,244
You ain't gonna eat
that, are you? Uh-uh.

207
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,980
How you gonna win those swimming
meets if you don't eat?

208
00:11:45,882 --> 00:11:48,117
I'm retired.

209
00:11:48,183 --> 00:11:51,488
Retired. Jack, you ain't even tired
enough to be retired.

210
00:11:55,525 --> 00:11:59,130
How is it exactly
you guys work?

211
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:03,199
I mean, like that boy
drowned at his initiation?

212
00:12:06,337 --> 00:12:08,204
Well, Yardley's the writer--

213
00:12:08,238 --> 00:12:12,009
And I'd guess you'd say
Ward is the nuts and bolts.

214
00:12:12,076 --> 00:12:14,012
Yeah. When I was
a reporter,

215
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,280
we had rewrite men who took
the stories over the phone.

216
00:12:16,347 --> 00:12:18,483
No, no, no.
I'm not a rewrite man.

217
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,285
I'm the writer.

218
00:12:20,352 --> 00:12:23,455
I'm the one who puts
the facts into perspective.

219
00:12:23,522 --> 00:12:25,190
Oh!

220
00:12:25,257 --> 00:12:27,726
Yes. It's a different
world now, Mr. Jansen.

221
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,265
Clearly.

222
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,267
Times have changed
a bit, sir.

223
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:37,169
What interest does
"The Miami Times"

224
00:12:37,235 --> 00:12:39,806
have in Hillary
Van Wetter?

225
00:12:39,872 --> 00:12:41,474
He murdered
somebody in jail?

226
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,676
Even if he was guilty--

227
00:12:43,743 --> 00:12:46,179
It was a lynching, pure and simple.
--he had certain rights.

228
00:12:46,245 --> 00:12:48,282
And even
if he was guilty--

229
00:12:48,349 --> 00:12:51,718
Hillary has rights that the process
completely disregarded.

230
00:12:51,784 --> 00:12:54,555
And that's why
we're here.

231
00:12:54,621 --> 00:12:57,924
I'm very sorry, everybody,
but I'm going to have to leave.

232
00:12:57,991 --> 00:12:59,994
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

233
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,428
I have early evaluations
first thing in the morning.

234
00:13:02,495 --> 00:13:03,931
Come here, sugar.
I apologize.

235
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,134
All right, buddy.

236
00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:10,537
Ward?

237
00:13:10,604 --> 00:13:11,772
Good night, boys.

238
00:13:13,642 --> 00:13:15,210
Ward?

239
00:13:18,947 --> 00:13:21,650
Seems mighty sure
of himself for a colored.

240
00:13:24,786 --> 00:13:28,557
Ward said
they need a driver.

241
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:30,158
A driver?

242
00:13:30,225 --> 00:13:32,360
What you do out there?

243
00:13:32,427 --> 00:13:35,231
So you meet anybody new
out there in Miami?

244
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:40,436
I met a few.

245
00:13:40,503 --> 00:13:43,806
Oh, yeah. All types down there,
you know?

246
00:13:43,873 --> 00:13:45,508
You stay away
from those rough ones.

247
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,476
Remember what happened
the last time.

248
00:13:49,478 --> 00:13:50,713
How your kids?

249
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,548
You look beautiful, babe.

250
00:13:52,615 --> 00:13:55,585
They're doing good.
They're doing really good.

251
00:13:55,619 --> 00:13:57,420
As soon as I get
out of here,

252
00:13:57,486 --> 00:14:01,692
I'll go see them and make dinner
all over again.

253
00:14:04,227 --> 00:14:05,729
You should come
to that dinner, too.

254
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,232
I'll come
to that dinner.

255
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:13,404
I think Ellen is
maybe number four--

256
00:14:13,471 --> 00:14:14,973
since you left.

257
00:14:16,373 --> 00:14:18,142
Yeah.

258
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:20,278
That's why I don't take
them bitches too seriously.

259
00:14:20,345 --> 00:14:23,881
They come and they go
and they come and they go.

260
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:26,284
You know
what I mean?

261
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:30,855
# At last
My dreams come true #

262
00:14:30,888 --> 00:14:34,293
# Today he said "I do" #

263
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,562
# Friends said
It couldn't be done #

264
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:41,333
# But all his love
I know I've won #

265
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,736
How you doing there, Yard?
Oh, jeez.

266
00:14:43,802 --> 00:14:48,908
# That's where he placed
The wedding band #

267
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:54,848
Hey, close
that door, boy.

268
00:14:54,914 --> 00:14:57,049
I don't want your daddy
screaming about all the flies

269
00:14:57,116 --> 00:14:58,518
getting in the house.

270
00:14:58,585 --> 00:15:00,754
Hmm.

271
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,757
Who is that, Jack?

272
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:04,891
Uh--

273
00:15:09,096 --> 00:15:11,765
I'm looking for the office
of Mr. Jansen.

274
00:15:11,831 --> 00:15:13,801
Ward Jansen
of "The Miami Times."

275
00:15:13,868 --> 00:15:16,337
I said who is it?
I work for the Times.

276
00:15:16,403 --> 00:15:17,938
You do?
Yeah.

277
00:15:19,307 --> 00:15:21,075
Huh.

278
00:15:21,142 --> 00:15:24,345
Well, I'm Charlotte Bless.
I'm Jack Jansen.

279
00:15:24,412 --> 00:15:26,447
Here, let me get that.
Oh.

280
00:15:26,514 --> 00:15:29,084
Hey.
All my files.

281
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:32,053
The office
is in the garage.

282
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:35,057
You look a little young
to be a journalist.

283
00:15:35,123 --> 00:15:37,859
I'm really just the driver.
Oh.

284
00:15:37,926 --> 00:15:39,995
But I do write.

285
00:15:40,062 --> 00:15:43,899
So do I. I write letters.
I'm pretty good.

286
00:15:47,135 --> 00:15:48,604
Hey, guys!

287
00:15:48,671 --> 00:15:50,339
This here is
Miss Charlotte Bless.

288
00:15:50,405 --> 00:15:52,240
Oh, not for long.

289
00:15:52,308 --> 00:15:54,310
Hillary and I are engaged
to be married.

290
00:15:54,377 --> 00:15:56,245
Hello, Miss Bless.
I'm Ward.

291
00:15:56,312 --> 00:15:59,048
Oh, Mr. Ward, good to finally
meet you.

292
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:01,884
You didn't mention the engagement
in your letters. Go clean yourself up.

293
00:16:01,951 --> 00:16:04,253
Well, it only just happened.
He just proposed.

294
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,756
Oh, that looks nasty.
Well, how did I do that?

295
00:16:06,823 --> 00:16:08,993
Excuse me a second.

296
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:11,327
Get Miss Bless something to drink.
I'm Yardley Acheman.

297
00:16:11,394 --> 00:16:13,230
We thought you
and Hillary hadn't met.

298
00:16:13,297 --> 00:16:14,832
Well, only in pictures,

299
00:16:14,898 --> 00:16:16,567
but we been writing
each other for months

300
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,569
and we understand
ourselves just perfect.

301
00:16:18,636 --> 00:16:20,471
Ward, where should
I put her files?

302
00:16:20,537 --> 00:16:22,407
Everything you need to know
about Van Wetter

303
00:16:22,474 --> 00:16:23,607
that's been in the papers,

304
00:16:23,674 --> 00:16:25,342
is here in these boxes.

305
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:27,746
Our exciting correspondence
is in that box.

306
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:29,514
In case
you're interested.

307
00:16:30,814 --> 00:16:32,651
My desk, Jackie boy.

308
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,459
Mr. Jansen, I really just
wanted to thank you.

309
00:16:41,526 --> 00:16:43,462
I wanted to thank you
for returning my letters.

310
00:16:43,496 --> 00:16:46,331
And for helping me get Hillary out
of that hellhole.

311
00:16:46,364 --> 00:16:48,567
Well, I wouldn't go
booking the honeymoon just yet.

312
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:50,136
But we are going
to fight his sentence

313
00:16:50,202 --> 00:16:51,971
and the way
it came about.

314
00:16:52,038 --> 00:16:54,040
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

315
00:16:54,106 --> 00:16:58,711
Nobody deserves the death penalty,
Miss Bless.

316
00:16:58,778 --> 00:17:00,980
Not even
Hillary Van Wetter.

317
00:17:01,047 --> 00:17:04,884
Um, excuse me. So, everything is
ordered alphabetically.

318
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:07,454
I was telling, um--
what's your name?

319
00:17:07,487 --> 00:17:08,789
Yardley.
Yardley.

320
00:17:08,855 --> 00:17:11,892
Um, that all
of the files,

321
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,394
Um, everything that's been
in the papers,

322
00:17:14,461 --> 00:17:17,731
is in the top box.
This is gonna be a great help.

323
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:20,000
He's an innocent man.
You're gonna find that out.

324
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:21,836
Wrongly convicted.

325
00:17:21,903 --> 00:17:23,504
This is gonna get us
off to a great start.

326
00:17:23,571 --> 00:17:25,872
I've done a lot of research.
I see that.

327
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:28,376
In the meantime, you need to freshen
up or anything?

328
00:17:28,443 --> 00:17:31,980
Jack, show Miss Bless to the washroom.
I think I'll just stay here.

329
00:17:32,046 --> 00:17:34,449
You might have some questions
that you need answered.

330
00:17:34,515 --> 00:17:36,017
I can freshen
up just here.

331
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:39,053
Cold beer for me, Jack.

332
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,922
You're adorable, Jack.

333
00:17:40,989 --> 00:17:42,825
I will take an iced tea
if you have it.

334
00:17:42,891 --> 00:17:44,625
You want anything, Ward?
I'm good.

335
00:17:44,692 --> 00:17:46,662
You'll see, uh--

336
00:17:46,729 --> 00:17:49,064
it's an enormous amount of work--
What's with the boxes?

337
00:17:49,131 --> 00:17:52,668
I don't know what to do here.
What's with the boxes?

338
00:17:52,735 --> 00:17:54,870
Well, we're
gonna start on it.

339
00:17:54,937 --> 00:17:58,407
My Jack was in love
with Charlotte Bless.

340
00:17:58,474 --> 00:18:00,175
I could tell
that horny little boy

341
00:18:00,242 --> 00:18:02,712
wanted to jump her
on first sight.

342
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:07,751
Everybody was confused why she was
engaged to Hillary Van Wetter.

343
00:18:07,817 --> 00:18:11,120
Nasty, white trash swamp.

344
00:18:11,186 --> 00:18:13,523
"All the killers
who have written me

345
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,694
want to press their mouths
into my vagina

346
00:18:16,727 --> 00:18:19,729
and some, even the crack
of my behind,

347
00:18:19,763 --> 00:18:22,433
except Hillary Van Wetter.

348
00:18:24,435 --> 00:18:26,604
He has no such desire.

349
00:18:26,637 --> 00:18:29,807
He wants to be
sucked off himself.

350
00:18:29,874 --> 00:18:33,077
I consider this psychological proof
of his innocence. "

351
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:37,649
She is one nasty
little nut job.

352
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:40,251
Think we've been taking
her a little too seriously.

353
00:18:40,318 --> 00:18:42,421
You sure get
bored quick.

354
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:44,456
No. Can tell I'm not going
to get laid anytime soon

355
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,459
in this Floridian
shit pit, so--

356
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,661
Listen--
Hey, Kathy, it's me.

357
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:51,663
Hillary tells her
that the knife

358
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,799
Yardley.
and the bloodied shirt

359
00:18:53,865 --> 00:18:56,369
that the deputies claim
to have found in his house

360
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:59,538
somehow got lost
before the trial.

361
00:18:59,604 --> 00:19:01,607
Yeah, I miss you, too.

362
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:03,443
What?

363
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:05,978
Hello, Kathy.

364
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,117
Miss Bless wanted
to look at the prison.

365
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:13,753
Jack's first assignment
was to take her there.

366
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:16,857
I bet he knows
I'm here.

367
00:19:16,924 --> 00:19:18,925
See, people who fall
in love outside--

368
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,962
of a normal relationship,

369
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:27,801
they have these powers--
telepathic powers.

370
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:30,971
Hillary and I have that kind
of connection, you dig?

371
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:42,283
Now why ain't you
in college?

372
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,019
Huh?

373
00:19:44,052 --> 00:19:47,022
Uh, I was a swimmer when
I was in school.

374
00:19:47,055 --> 00:19:48,823
No kidding?
Yeah.

375
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,992
I was a swimmer.
You were?

376
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,927
Uh-huh. I'd swim
like a mermaid

377
00:19:52,994 --> 00:19:56,666
if it wasn't
for my damn curly hair.

378
00:19:56,732 --> 00:19:58,733
I think straight hair
gives me class.

379
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,470
All right.

380
00:20:02,571 --> 00:20:03,673
Good.

381
00:20:05,307 --> 00:20:07,209
So?

382
00:20:07,276 --> 00:20:10,012
Well, we was drunk one night,
and, uh--

383
00:20:12,915 --> 00:20:15,351
I just--

384
00:20:15,418 --> 00:20:17,354
I lost my temper
and just--

385
00:20:18,854 --> 00:20:20,723
well, I emptied the pool.

386
00:20:20,756 --> 00:20:22,259
At your college?

387
00:20:22,326 --> 00:20:23,860
The University
of Florida.

388
00:20:25,996 --> 00:20:29,900
They called that vandalism,
I guess.

389
00:20:29,966 --> 00:20:32,369
It's actually not as easy
to do as it sounds.

390
00:20:34,104 --> 00:20:35,873
So you lose
your temper often?

391
00:20:39,743 --> 00:20:41,346
Mm.

392
00:20:41,412 --> 00:20:43,014
This place is full of boys
just like you

393
00:20:43,081 --> 00:20:44,782
who lost their temper
one day.

394
00:20:47,552 --> 00:20:52,191
I'm getting horny
being this close to him.

395
00:20:53,391 --> 00:20:54,792
Oh, baby.

396
00:20:56,628 --> 00:20:59,130
I bet he's horny
for me all the time.

397
00:21:00,766 --> 00:21:01,767
Yeah.

398
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,801
Mmm.

399
00:21:05,604 --> 00:21:07,439
Oh, I can feel him.

400
00:21:11,878 --> 00:21:12,878
Can I help you folks?

401
00:21:12,945 --> 00:21:14,313
Oh, no.

402
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:20,252
Yes, Officer.
Uh--hm.

403
00:21:20,285 --> 00:21:23,256
We just wanted to sit in your
parking lot for a little while.

404
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:25,392
What for?

405
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,961
His daddy's in there and we wanted
to send him good vibrations.

406
00:21:28,028 --> 00:21:30,096
Some good what?

407
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:34,834
Oh, these special things
called good vibrations.

408
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,706
Sorry, ma'am.
Y'all can't park here.

409
00:21:38,773 --> 00:21:40,106
Oh.

410
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,777
Yes, Officer.

411
00:21:51,753 --> 00:21:53,954
The story that Hillary
told the deputies

412
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,658
was never investigated.

413
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:59,428
He simply told it once
from the witness stand

414
00:21:59,461 --> 00:22:01,129
and was never asked
to elaborate,

415
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:05,100
not even
by his own lawyers.

416
00:22:17,547 --> 00:22:19,615
Good to see you again, Ward.
Nice to see you.

417
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:31,628
Sir, this is my writing partner,
Mr. Yardley Acheman.

418
00:22:37,835 --> 00:22:40,371
Of course.

419
00:22:40,437 --> 00:22:42,406
I suppose
the best place to start

420
00:22:42,473 --> 00:22:44,174
would be
the beginning.

421
00:22:44,241 --> 00:22:45,877
I was born
in this county.

422
00:22:45,944 --> 00:22:50,382
1897, to poor
but proud parents.

423
00:22:50,448 --> 00:22:53,118
Mr. Pine, could we
skip 65 years,

424
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,918
save everyone some time?

425
00:22:57,489 --> 00:22:59,858
Hillary Van Wetter, 1965?

426
00:22:59,924 --> 00:23:02,494
Oh, I can't agree to talk to you
about that matter.

427
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,663
Not without
my client's permission.

428
00:23:04,729 --> 00:23:08,500
He's entitled to his privacy,
just like anybody else.

429
00:23:08,566 --> 00:23:11,337
You have his permission.
He wrote you.

430
00:23:11,404 --> 00:23:13,571
I'll have to check
that out.

431
00:23:13,638 --> 00:23:16,042
I'm sure the letters would be
in your files, Mr. Pine.

432
00:23:16,108 --> 00:23:18,244
That's what you say,
but I have a client to protect.

433
00:23:20,047 --> 00:23:22,648
Look here.

434
00:23:22,715 --> 00:23:25,052
If we have to get a lawyer of
our own down here

435
00:23:25,118 --> 00:23:27,386
to sort this out,
then while he's here,

436
00:23:27,453 --> 00:23:32,125
we're gonna have him look through every
aspect of Mr. Van Wetter's case.

437
00:23:32,192 --> 00:23:34,760
Including the competency
of his defense.

438
00:23:34,827 --> 00:23:37,798
There was nothing wrong with the defense
Hillary Van Wetter got in court!

439
00:23:37,864 --> 00:23:40,368
Then you have nothing
to worry about from us.

440
00:23:40,434 --> 00:23:41,735
We just want
to talk to him.

441
00:23:41,802 --> 00:23:43,403
Then we'll be
out of your--

442
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,206
You don't know a thing
about this person!

443
00:23:45,273 --> 00:23:49,811
You've been in this world
for five minutes, boy!

444
00:23:49,877 --> 00:23:53,081
Now that's just
not necessary, Mr. Pine.

445
00:23:53,147 --> 00:23:55,383
Yes. I talk the way I want
in my office!

446
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,618
All right. Then you'll arrange
the meeting, will you?

447
00:24:03,658 --> 00:24:04,994
Quick!
We're gonna be late!

448
00:24:07,662 --> 00:24:09,765
You get
the marriage license?

449
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:35,392
I can't believe
we're doing this!

450
00:24:40,231 --> 00:24:42,365
Fuck! Jack, go knock
on the door again.

451
00:24:44,367 --> 00:24:46,904
There she is.
Whoa, baby

452
00:24:49,205 --> 00:24:51,575
Well, I say--
Good morning,
Miss Bless.

453
00:24:51,642 --> 00:24:53,778
Look at Daisy Mae.

454
00:24:53,844 --> 00:24:55,212
Morning.

455
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,380
You look
just fine.

456
00:24:56,447 --> 00:24:57,848
Hope he likes it.

457
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,890
Uh--

458
00:25:04,956 --> 00:25:06,958
Would you mind putting
up the windows?

459
00:25:07,025 --> 00:25:08,359
It's gonna muss my hair.

460
00:25:10,796 --> 00:25:13,832
Are you serious?

461
00:25:13,899 --> 00:25:16,068
I'm sweating like a pregnant nun
back here.

462
00:25:18,136 --> 00:25:19,672
Unbelievable!

463
00:25:36,356 --> 00:25:37,423
Hi.

464
00:25:53,907 --> 00:25:55,476
You got 15 minutes.

465
00:25:55,542 --> 00:25:57,044
No physical contact
of any kind.

466
00:25:57,111 --> 00:25:58,946
No tape recorders.

467
00:25:59,013 --> 00:26:00,682
No object may be passed
to the prisoner.

468
00:26:00,749 --> 00:26:02,049
I'll be right
outside this door.

469
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:12,627
Mr. Van Wetter,

470
00:26:12,694 --> 00:26:14,897
my name is Ward J ansen.

471
00:26:14,964 --> 00:26:19,602
This is my associate, Yardley Acheman--
You look like your picture.

472
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:24,573
Mmm.
I do?

473
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,609
Thank you.

474
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,579
These your
paperboys?

475
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:34,718
Mm-hm.

476
00:26:34,785 --> 00:26:36,519
What they gonna do
for us?

477
00:26:37,987 --> 00:26:40,824
They gonna save you.

478
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,958
They're gonna save us?

479
00:26:45,762 --> 00:26:46,630
Mm-hm.

480
00:26:51,935 --> 00:26:54,138
Shit. They can't even
save themselves.

481
00:26:54,205 --> 00:26:55,872
Mr. Van Wetter,
we wanted to ask you

482
00:26:55,939 --> 00:26:57,441
about the lost evidence
in your case.

483
00:26:57,507 --> 00:26:59,677
Shut up. Can't you see
I'm busy?

484
00:27:04,182 --> 00:27:07,251
Will you do something
for me right now?

485
00:27:07,318 --> 00:27:11,589
Oh.
Oh, I wish I could.

486
00:27:17,128 --> 00:27:19,531
Spread your legs open
a little bit.

487
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,637
Mmm.
Yeah.

488
00:27:25,704 --> 00:27:27,639
Now tear off
them pantyhose.

489
00:27:27,706 --> 00:27:29,441
Rip those off.

490
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:34,547
Yeah.
Mm-hm.

491
00:27:34,614 --> 00:27:36,515
Move your hands away.
Mmm.

492
00:27:36,548 --> 00:27:39,386
Yeah.

493
00:27:46,459 --> 00:27:48,461
Now open
up your mouth--

494
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:50,563
you picture what you wrote
me in your letters.

495
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,774
You bitch!

496
00:29:02,306 --> 00:29:03,640
Oh, I love you.

497
00:29:11,215 --> 00:29:13,351
What the hell's
going on in here?

498
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,587
You're a good girl. I warned y'all!
This visit's over!

499
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,154
I told y'all this visit was--
come on!

500
00:29:17,221 --> 00:29:18,590
Come on, Hillary.
No!

501
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:20,859
No!
There's nothing going on!

502
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,594
Shit!
No!

503
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:26,164
What the fuck?
I didn't touch that girl!

504
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,034
No!
No!

505
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,068
What the fuck
you laughing about?

506
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,108
Come on now,
Miss Bless.

507
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:38,544
Jack came home
and threw up after that.

508
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:40,346
He couldn't believe
he still loved her

509
00:29:40,413 --> 00:29:42,983
after what he saw,
but he did.

510
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:46,285
You're Ward Ward's boy?
Mm-hm.

511
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:49,423
Most contrary man
in all of Moat County.

512
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,695
What may I do for you
gentlemen today?

513
00:29:54,761 --> 00:29:57,430
It's about the murder
of Sheriff Call.

514
00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:59,566
I understand that there's
some physical evidence

515
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:01,768
relating to the case
that was lost?

516
00:30:01,835 --> 00:30:04,237
Yes, sir.
I believe there was.

517
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:06,707
Well, we was wondering
what sort of explanation

518
00:30:06,773 --> 00:30:09,377
the department might have.

519
00:30:09,444 --> 00:30:10,644
I wish I knew.

520
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:16,351
Mr. Van Wetter once cut
a deputy's thumb off.

521
00:30:18,252 --> 00:30:20,054
Did you know that?

522
00:30:20,121 --> 00:30:23,225
It was over a traffic ticket,
if I remember.

523
00:30:23,292 --> 00:30:26,060
You can't do much
without your thumb.

524
00:30:26,127 --> 00:30:29,999
It's what separates us
from the primates.

525
00:30:30,065 --> 00:30:34,169
For a little thing like holding
your wife's titty.

526
00:30:34,236 --> 00:30:37,405
You're not married,
Mr. Jansen? No.

527
00:30:41,043 --> 00:30:43,146
A little thing like that,
you can't do it.

528
00:30:45,581 --> 00:30:47,182
Maybe I'll just go talk
to the deputies

529
00:30:47,249 --> 00:30:49,085
who was involved
in the arrest.

530
00:30:49,152 --> 00:30:50,919
You can talk
to whoever you want

531
00:30:50,986 --> 00:30:53,356
as long as they'll talk to you.
But they won't.

532
00:30:53,423 --> 00:30:55,658
And why is that?

533
00:30:55,725 --> 00:30:58,061
They haven't forgotten
what Hillary did to one of theirs.

534
00:30:58,128 --> 00:30:59,696
The judge
allowed testimony

535
00:30:59,763 --> 00:31:01,398
based on evidence
that he never even saw.

536
00:31:01,464 --> 00:31:03,367
He took the officer's word
over Hillary's.

537
00:31:03,434 --> 00:31:06,670
I can't say I blame him.
Nobody does.

538
00:31:15,513 --> 00:31:17,748
You got me
in the face there.

539
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,759
So you've got
to ask him.

540
00:31:27,793 --> 00:31:29,895
Where was he
between 2:00 and 6:00?

541
00:31:29,961 --> 00:31:31,295
I'm gonna ask him
about some things he wrote,

542
00:31:31,362 --> 00:31:32,964
some letters to Charlotte.

543
00:31:38,236 --> 00:31:39,604
H ere we go.

544
00:31:39,671 --> 00:31:40,906
Hold.

545
00:31:43,376 --> 00:31:45,010
Good morning,
Mr. Van Wetter.

546
00:31:49,816 --> 00:31:51,083
Hey.

547
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:55,288
Where's your dress?

548
00:31:55,355 --> 00:31:57,458
You don't like me
like this?

549
00:31:57,524 --> 00:32:00,093
You know a prisoner
by the name of--

550
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,661
Ward, Ward, Ward.

551
00:32:01,728 --> 00:32:03,330
You know a prisoner
by the name

552
00:32:03,397 --> 00:32:05,832
of Mr. Bobby Valentine?
Mr. Van Wetter?

553
00:32:05,898 --> 00:32:08,502
Mr. Demarcus Williams,
Mr. Bobby Hinton?

554
00:32:08,569 --> 00:32:10,971
Another prisoner
by the name of Jimmy Edwards,

555
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:13,207
another one, Demarcus.

556
00:32:13,273 --> 00:32:15,342
I think his name is Curt.
I forgot his last name.

557
00:32:15,409 --> 00:32:17,579
Anyway, you know what
they all have in common?

558
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:20,280
Hey, Martin Luther King.

559
00:32:20,347 --> 00:32:22,317
You know what they all had
in common? What?

560
00:32:22,384 --> 00:32:24,918
They all wear pants.

561
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:27,122
Every goddamned man
in here wears pants!

562
00:32:27,188 --> 00:32:29,157
How am I supposed to tell
you apart from them?

563
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,925
Don't talk to her like that!
Sit down, Jack.

564
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:32,861
Sit the fuck down.

565
00:32:32,927 --> 00:32:35,130
Mr. Van Wetter, we don't have
a lot of time, all right?

566
00:32:35,196 --> 00:32:36,965
We got to move on.

567
00:32:37,033 --> 00:32:39,534
You're gonna move
on one way or another, Ward?

568
00:32:39,601 --> 00:32:41,770
Ward's in charge!

569
00:32:41,836 --> 00:32:45,440
He's gonna get his way--
till he don't.

570
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:48,310
Maybe that's how he got
his scars on the face.

571
00:32:51,313 --> 00:32:54,283
You mentioned in one
of your letters to Miss Bless

572
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,852
that you was working
Turn around, bitch!

573
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,155
An Uncle Tyree--
Yeah, yeah.

574
00:32:59,221 --> 00:33:00,823
at the time
of the murder.

575
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:01,892
What kind of work you doing?
Lawn work.

576
00:33:01,958 --> 00:33:03,593
Lawn work.

577
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,494
You wear a dress
in here next time

578
00:33:05,561 --> 00:33:08,198
or you don't bother coming!
Bitch, look at me!

579
00:33:12,469 --> 00:33:14,037
And stop bringing
that fucking nigger

580
00:33:14,071 --> 00:33:15,906
think he
Muhammad Ali with you!

581
00:33:15,972 --> 00:33:17,508
Mr. Van Wetter,
come have a seat.

582
00:33:17,575 --> 00:33:19,743
Cassius Clay, nigger.

583
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,445
We can get a dress
here in five minutes.

584
00:33:21,511 --> 00:33:22,714
Why don't you
have a seat?

585
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,748
Go home, boy!

586
00:33:27,585 --> 00:33:29,554
I don't know--

587
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:33,658
Charlotte, where does one get
pants like that from anyway?

588
00:33:33,725 --> 00:33:36,694
Well, I think we got
the case licked.

589
00:33:36,762 --> 00:33:38,330
This is
a fucking circus!

590
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,670
In this town,

591
00:33:45,737 --> 00:33:47,706
Weldon Pine helped get
Sheriff Call re-elected.

592
00:33:47,773 --> 00:33:49,875
Tension was brewing
in the house.

593
00:33:49,942 --> 00:33:53,078
Jack was getting jealous of
Hillary and Charlotte.

594
00:33:55,514 --> 00:33:58,817
And he was getting jealous
of Ward and Yardley, too.

595
00:33:58,884 --> 00:34:04,524
Ward wasn't somebody who
attached himself to just anybody.

596
00:34:04,591 --> 00:34:06,993
Your dad's girlfriend,
what's her name?

597
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,896
Jack couldn't understand why he
was so attached to that Yardley.

598
00:34:09,963 --> 00:34:12,298
No, you didn't.

599
00:34:12,365 --> 00:34:14,067
What is the hottest
temperature

600
00:34:14,134 --> 00:34:15,535
that you've
ever been in?

601
00:34:15,602 --> 00:34:17,071
125.

602
00:34:17,104 --> 00:34:18,938
How about you?

603
00:34:19,005 --> 00:34:21,074
Just put your hand out
and it burns off

604
00:34:21,141 --> 00:34:23,310
The hottest was when I lived
in Florida. How about you?

605
00:34:23,377 --> 00:34:25,979
It doesn't bother me.
I never pay attention to it.

606
00:34:26,046 --> 00:34:29,784
Cold and wet just goes
fucking through you like a knife

607
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,853
but--I don't know.

608
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:37,125
So how's Mr. Van Wetter today?
He still innocent?

609
00:34:37,192 --> 00:34:39,660
I don't know.
If he is--

610
00:34:39,727 --> 00:34:42,931
he sure as hell didn't have no help
proving it,

611
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,866
not from that
Weldon Pine guy anyway.

612
00:34:44,933 --> 00:34:47,502
Could I have a fork
or something?

613
00:34:47,569 --> 00:34:50,505
The chicken legs, you eat those
with your hands.

614
00:34:50,572 --> 00:34:52,308
Maybe at your house.

615
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:54,276
This is
the South, sugar.

616
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:56,746
Anyway, you know
how I feel about that.

617
00:34:56,813 --> 00:34:59,948
Do you eat your mashed potatoes with
your hands? Do you really want to--?

618
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:03,753
Do you really want to--? Do you really want to--?
Bring me some chopsticks, Anita.

619
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,255
Do you really want
to take the shot--

620
00:35:06,322 --> 00:35:08,791
on putting to death
a man or a woman

621
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:12,962
when maybe they're innocent?
I mean, I don't.

622
00:35:13,029 --> 00:35:16,600
I don't want to try to have
to live with that.

623
00:35:16,667 --> 00:35:20,503
On the other hand-- Are you gonna
eat that or torture it?

624
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:22,006
T old you,
I'm not hungry.

625
00:35:22,072 --> 00:35:24,341
That's'cause
you're in love.

626
00:35:24,408 --> 00:35:26,410
I know who you're
sniffing around, too.

627
00:35:26,477 --> 00:35:28,212
Anita, please don't tease him
at the table.

628
00:35:28,278 --> 00:35:30,147
On the other hand,
if somebody's guilty,

629
00:35:30,214 --> 00:35:34,151
well, you want to pay
their room and board 365?

630
00:35:34,218 --> 00:35:35,085
Absolutely.
Ah!

631
00:35:35,152 --> 00:35:36,721
Whoops.

632
00:35:36,788 --> 00:35:39,391
I'm so sorry.

633
00:35:39,457 --> 00:35:42,293
Anyway, it's just iced tea.
It ain't even gonna stain.

634
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,899
You'da thought Jack woulda
had a girlfriend by now,

635
00:35:47,966 --> 00:35:49,901
but all he did was jerk
off to the pictures

636
00:35:49,968 --> 00:35:53,505
in those nudie magazines
that was under his bed.

637
00:35:53,571 --> 00:35:57,276
Now she was all he could think
of night and day.

638
00:35:57,343 --> 00:35:59,512
Oh, yeah, he was
definitely in love.

639
00:36:02,348 --> 00:36:03,949
He needed her.

640
00:36:04,016 --> 00:36:06,353
What you reading?
You give it to me.

641
00:36:06,419 --> 00:36:09,555
What is this shit?
" Lolita."

642
00:36:09,622 --> 00:36:11,558
Porno, I bet.

643
00:36:15,594 --> 00:36:16,863
Oh.

644
00:36:19,032 --> 00:36:21,401
You need a girlfriend.

645
00:36:26,474 --> 00:36:28,108
Look at them girls
over there.

646
00:36:28,175 --> 00:36:31,412
Go on and introduce yourself.
Go on.

647
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,017
I'm just fine
right here.

648
00:36:41,422 --> 00:36:43,191
You want me to blow you,
don't you?

649
00:36:43,257 --> 00:36:45,693
You don't have to answer.
I know it's true.

650
00:36:49,797 --> 00:36:51,967
I'm not gonna blow
a friendship--

651
00:36:52,034 --> 00:36:54,402
over a stupid
little blowjob.

652
00:36:57,406 --> 00:36:58,407
You hear me?

653
00:37:00,042 --> 00:37:01,744
Look, why you talking
to me like that?

654
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:05,782
See that one in blue?
She'll blow you.

655
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:07,983
I don't want someone like
that blowing me.

656
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,285
It's a good thing
you're not in prison

657
00:37:10,352 --> 00:37:12,155
because you wouldn't have
a choice there.

658
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,895
Fuck you.

659
00:37:25,101 --> 00:37:27,337
Jack, come back here.

660
00:37:27,404 --> 00:37:30,641
# Well, well #

661
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:36,313
# I passed the corner
Where we first met #

662
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,449
# Yes, I did #

663
00:37:38,516 --> 00:37:42,753
# Memories of our love
Linger there yet #

664
00:37:44,655 --> 00:37:48,025
# Oh, I'm sitting
On top of the world #

665
00:37:48,092 --> 00:37:52,698
# Just to know
That you're my girl #

666
00:37:52,764 --> 00:37:56,435
# I'm just lucky #

667
00:37:56,501 --> 00:38:01,373
# I'm lucky, lucky,
Lucky in love #

668
00:38:19,292 --> 00:38:20,860
# Our love is here--#

669
00:38:27,501 --> 00:38:29,869
# Lucky, lucky, lucky
In love--#

670
00:38:40,348 --> 00:38:44,084
# Oh, I'm sitting
On top of the world #

671
00:38:44,151 --> 00:38:46,921
# Just to know
That she's my girl #

672
00:38:46,988 --> 00:38:49,723
# That makes me lucky #

673
00:38:49,757 --> 00:38:52,093
Oh my God.
Pam.

674
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,595
# I'm so lucky lucky
Lucky in love #

675
00:38:54,661 --> 00:38:57,365
# Let me sing
One more time ##

676
00:38:57,432 --> 00:39:00,169
What is that?
Is he okay?

677
00:39:00,236 --> 00:39:01,736
Is he having
an allergic reaction?

678
00:39:01,803 --> 00:39:03,772
A jellyfish sting
or something?

679
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:05,441
A fucking jellyfish
did that.

680
00:39:05,508 --> 00:39:07,443
You're supposed to piss
on a jellyfish sting.

681
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,444
We're gonna have to do
something embarrassing.

682
00:39:09,511 --> 00:39:11,414
You got to hang
in there. Hey!

683
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,282
Well, you're gonna--
You'll piss on him?

684
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:14,950
What are you
doing to him?

685
00:39:15,017 --> 00:39:16,619
Call an ambulance.

686
00:39:16,686 --> 00:39:18,421
He's having a reaction!
Shut the fuck up!

687
00:39:18,487 --> 00:39:20,190
Don't push me!
You're supposed to piss--

688
00:39:20,223 --> 00:39:21,857
Get the fuck out of here!
I can see this.

689
00:39:21,924 --> 00:39:24,560
I can see he's poisoned.
You don't pee on--

690
00:39:24,627 --> 00:39:26,830
Don't push me!
I will slap your face.

691
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:28,964
Get the fuck out of here.
All right.

692
00:39:29,031 --> 00:39:32,436
I said, I will kick your ass!
I'm going to call the police.

693
00:39:32,502 --> 00:39:34,271
Move it!
Fine.

694
00:39:34,304 --> 00:39:36,206
If anyone's gonna piss
on him, it's gonna be me!

695
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:37,808
Fine, fuck you!

696
00:39:37,874 --> 00:39:39,676
He don't like strangers
peeing on him!

697
00:39:39,743 --> 00:39:41,145
Come on. Come on.

698
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,213
Come on, baby come on!
Wake up!

699
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,748
Come on! Shit!

700
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:46,584
# La la la #

701
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:51,389
# Zippeydoo da #

702
00:39:51,456 --> 00:39:52,323
Come on.

703
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:54,592
Come on!

704
00:39:56,327 --> 00:40:00,265
# No matter
What people say #

705
00:40:00,332 --> 00:40:03,768
# I know our love
Is here to stay #

706
00:40:03,835 --> 00:40:08,273
# And I'm so lucky #

707
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,607
You're gonna be okay!

708
00:40:09,675 --> 00:40:12,444
# Lucky lucky in love #

709
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:15,948
# I'm mister lucky #

710
00:40:16,015 --> 00:40:19,184
# I'm so lucky
Lucky lucky in love ##

711
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:20,453
Jack.

712
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,920
What are you doing here?

713
00:40:21,987 --> 00:40:24,456
What do you think
I'm doing here?

714
00:40:26,192 --> 00:40:27,460
Told you to knock
on my door

715
00:40:27,527 --> 00:40:28,528
before you come
in my room.

716
00:40:28,594 --> 00:40:30,030
Oh, hush up.

717
00:40:31,631 --> 00:40:33,266
Here, I brought
you something.

718
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:34,769
Take these pills.

719
00:40:34,802 --> 00:40:37,003
I smell awful.

720
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:39,807
That's because that blond
lady peed all over your face.

721
00:40:41,675 --> 00:40:45,446
Ugh. Here,
drink this.

722
00:40:45,513 --> 00:40:46,881
Does it hurt?

723
00:40:50,685 --> 00:40:52,820
I'm cold,
I'm cold,
I'm cold.

724
00:41:04,065 --> 00:41:07,969
Congratulations, Jack.
We're in the paper.

725
00:41:08,036 --> 00:41:12,407
"Fast action saves
Lately man at beach.

726
00:41:12,474 --> 00:41:14,343
"Miss Charlotte Bless
of Mobile, Alabama

727
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:16,511
apparently saved
Mr. Jansen's life

728
00:41:16,578 --> 00:41:18,647
by urinating over the areas
of his body

729
00:41:18,714 --> 00:41:20,850
where he was attacked.

730
00:41:20,917 --> 00:41:23,919
These included the victim's arms,
genitals and face. "

731
00:41:23,985 --> 00:41:25,621
Jack, I had no idea.

732
00:41:25,688 --> 00:41:27,056
I had no idea
that your own father

733
00:41:27,123 --> 00:41:28,524
would print
something like that.

734
00:41:28,591 --> 00:41:30,159
It made the AP wire.

735
00:41:30,226 --> 00:41:34,097
You're famous
all over the country.

736
00:41:34,163 --> 00:41:38,201
"Home Remedy."
Good title.

737
00:41:38,267 --> 00:41:41,405
What's Dad trying
to do to me?

738
00:41:41,472 --> 00:41:44,441
It's called the newspaper
business, Jack.

739
00:41:48,245 --> 00:41:49,546
Oh, shit.

740
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,053
Let him go, Jack!
You're gonna kill him.

741
00:42:04,629 --> 00:42:06,765
Jack, let him go.

742
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,474
You put your hands
on me again,

743
00:42:15,541 --> 00:42:16,975
I will fuck you up!
Yeah?

744
00:42:18,176 --> 00:42:19,211
Fuck you, nigger!

745
00:42:25,818 --> 00:42:27,787
He needs to get laid.

746
00:42:27,853 --> 00:42:30,189
He needs
a fucking straitjacket.

747
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,857
He's sexually repressed.

748
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,693
Sexually repressed
is a 40-year-old woman

749
00:42:33,726 --> 00:42:36,662
who's obsessed
with prison cock!

750
00:42:36,729 --> 00:42:38,597
That's not nice.
Calm down now.

751
00:42:38,664 --> 00:42:40,333
No, fuck calm down!

752
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,602
I'm not having
some kid call me a nigger.

753
00:42:42,669 --> 00:42:43,736
I want him
out of here now!

754
00:42:46,573 --> 00:42:48,141
Yardley?

755
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:57,784
Jack, let's go
to the prison.

756
00:42:57,851 --> 00:42:59,620
You two can stay here
and keep arguing.

757
00:42:59,687 --> 00:43:01,456
This time I'm talking
to Hillary by myself.

758
00:43:01,522 --> 00:43:03,024
Come on.

759
00:43:03,091 --> 00:43:04,759
He's not even
gonna look at you

760
00:43:04,826 --> 00:43:06,828
if I'm not there
in a pretty dress.

761
00:43:06,894 --> 00:43:08,864
Well, that's too bad
for him.

762
00:43:08,931 --> 00:43:10,465
Ward.

763
00:43:13,334 --> 00:43:15,003
You'll see.

764
00:43:23,879 --> 00:43:26,548
I knew Jack
didn't mean to say it.

765
00:43:26,615 --> 00:43:28,718
But those were the times
we were living in

766
00:43:28,785 --> 00:43:30,319
and it was
what it was.

767
00:43:32,388 --> 00:43:35,058
Yardley, on the other
hand, well--

768
00:43:39,729 --> 00:43:43,166
# Get out of the cold #

769
00:43:43,233 --> 00:43:46,970
# Take the night off #

770
00:43:47,037 --> 00:43:50,974
# Be your own boss #

771
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:54,412
# When you're near me #

772
00:43:54,478 --> 00:43:56,247
# Can you hear me #

773
00:43:56,313 --> 00:44:00,418
# Or do I have to shout
In your ear #

774
00:44:00,484 --> 00:44:01,786
# Mmm #

775
00:44:01,852 --> 00:44:05,089
# Take the night off #

776
00:44:05,156 --> 00:44:08,860
# Turn the light on #

777
00:44:08,927 --> 00:44:11,362
# Take the night off #

778
00:44:11,429 --> 00:44:14,099
# Turn the light on #

779
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:16,768
Forensic report says
that the sheriff

780
00:44:16,835 --> 00:44:19,337
was stabbed
between 2 and 3 AM.

781
00:44:19,404 --> 00:44:21,173
Y ep. Like I told you,

782
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:23,443
I was with-- my Uncle Tyree
doing lawn work

783
00:44:23,509 --> 00:44:25,110
in Ormond Beach
at the time.

784
00:44:25,177 --> 00:44:27,379
Lawn work?
Yes, sir.

785
00:44:27,446 --> 00:44:29,282
You mean stealing?
Yes, sir.

786
00:44:29,348 --> 00:44:31,349
Stealing sod
off a golf course.

787
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:34,554
A developer paid through
the teeth for that shit.

788
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,055
We sold it and we didn't
make it back

789
00:44:36,122 --> 00:44:37,823
to the river
till sunrise.

790
00:44:37,889 --> 00:44:39,792
What kind of developers?
Condominiums, man.

791
00:44:39,859 --> 00:44:41,961
You got a name?
No, I don't.

792
00:44:42,028 --> 00:44:45,064
Deputies say they found
the sheriff's body at 6 AM--

793
00:44:45,131 --> 00:44:47,200
but it was the way
he was killed.

794
00:44:50,304 --> 00:44:52,305
That's what makes everybody
assume it was you.

795
00:44:52,372 --> 00:44:55,309
What you think?
You tell me.

796
00:44:55,376 --> 00:44:57,977
I ain't the only one carrying
a machete around here.

797
00:45:00,814 --> 00:45:01,782
True.

798
00:45:03,318 --> 00:45:05,052
The deputies
went to Tyree's house,

799
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,187
he said he'd been sleeping
in bed all night

800
00:45:07,254 --> 00:45:10,824
and had a whole bunch of family
members there to confirm it.

801
00:45:10,891 --> 00:45:12,893
Then they go
to your house--

802
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,497
where they find the bloodstained shirt
and knife.

803
00:45:15,563 --> 00:45:17,931
Yeah, all right.
Listen to me.

804
00:45:17,998 --> 00:45:21,102
Every knife and shirt that
I own is stained in blood.

805
00:45:21,169 --> 00:45:22,704
It's what I do
for a living.

806
00:45:22,771 --> 00:45:25,106
I'm gutting alligators
for their skin.

807
00:45:25,173 --> 00:45:26,941
Okay?
I was a bachelor.

808
00:45:27,008 --> 00:45:30,046
I didn't have nobody
to do my laundry.

809
00:45:30,112 --> 00:45:32,013
You probably got somebody
to do your laundry.

810
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,115
What you think?

811
00:45:34,417 --> 00:45:35,785
I bet you do.

812
00:45:38,954 --> 00:45:41,357
They never matched the blood
to the sheriff's, did they?

813
00:45:41,424 --> 00:45:43,160
Tell me how to find Tyree.

814
00:45:48,932 --> 00:45:51,967
The arms of mercy
are so wide

815
00:45:52,034 --> 00:45:54,705
they will accept any man,

816
00:45:54,771 --> 00:45:58,608
but they will not accept
any man wearing pants.

817
00:45:58,675 --> 00:46:01,978
Where is my woman?

818
00:46:04,549 --> 00:46:06,483
Where's my woman?

819
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:10,154
The only one you need
to talk to right now is me, baby.

820
00:46:10,221 --> 00:46:11,655
The only one
I need to talk to?

821
00:46:11,722 --> 00:46:13,291
I'm the only one.
I'm your mercy.

822
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:15,393
I'm your arms wide open,
I'm your pants.

823
00:46:18,129 --> 00:46:19,630
Ward's in charge!

824
00:46:24,069 --> 00:46:26,371
Ifyou wanna go see Tyree,
I'll give you directions,

825
00:46:26,437 --> 00:46:29,908
but you got to make that choice
because he's a violent man.

826
00:46:29,975 --> 00:46:31,676
Now stay with me now

827
00:46:31,743 --> 00:46:33,645
because this is
when it gets tricky.

828
00:46:33,712 --> 00:46:35,914
Ward called Charlotte

829
00:46:35,981 --> 00:46:40,819
and told her to drive Yardley
to Ormond Beach.

830
00:46:40,886 --> 00:46:45,090
He wanted to verify Hillary's
so-called golf course story.

831
00:46:45,157 --> 00:46:48,194
The boys went on to visit
this Uncle Tyree.

832
00:46:48,261 --> 00:46:50,864
Man, this is stupid.
Where are we going?

833
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:53,133
No one lives out here.
No one could live out here.

834
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:57,772
You talk to Anita about your--choice
of words?

835
00:47:00,373 --> 00:47:01,608
It was fucked up.

836
00:47:03,577 --> 00:47:05,111
I know.

837
00:47:16,624 --> 00:47:18,060
Goddamn it.

838
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,560
Sure you don't me
to watch the car?

839
00:47:21,395 --> 00:47:24,800
Goddamn it! This stuff
ain't working, man.

840
00:47:24,866 --> 00:47:26,801
It's like they
like this shit.

841
00:47:26,867 --> 00:47:28,303
Better than jellyfish,
I bet.

842
00:47:30,205 --> 00:47:32,106
Fuck!
Oh, my God!

843
00:47:32,173 --> 00:47:34,209
Watch it! You're way too
close to him. Ward! Ward!

844
00:47:34,276 --> 00:47:37,179
You better jump him.

845
00:47:37,245 --> 00:47:39,314
It's better in here
where we have to get lower.

846
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:45,754
Ward, you're sinking!

847
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,457
This whole place
is just floating.

848
00:47:56,599 --> 00:47:58,669
You ever think
about Mama?

849
00:48:06,442 --> 00:48:07,845
I wonder
where she at.

850
00:48:12,683 --> 00:48:14,918
She is
in Tucson, Arizona.

851
00:48:21,291 --> 00:48:22,460
You got a girlfriend?

852
00:48:29,434 --> 00:48:30,468
Why?

853
00:48:39,011 --> 00:48:42,882
You don't remember this, but
Mom used to go on about, uh--

854
00:48:42,948 --> 00:48:46,384
don't make love to a woman until
you get married, right? Mm-hm.

855
00:48:50,523 --> 00:48:52,225
I followed that
until I was--

856
00:48:56,162 --> 00:48:57,898
Oh, fuck that. We'll talk
about it later.

857
00:48:57,964 --> 00:48:59,066
Let's go.

858
00:49:09,042 --> 00:49:10,477
Mr. Van Wetter?

859
00:49:14,514 --> 00:49:16,483
Good afternoon, sir.

860
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:18,820
My name is Ward Jansen.
I work for "The Miami Times. "

861
00:49:18,886 --> 00:49:21,488
We're here on behalf here
of your nephew, Hillary.

862
00:49:23,691 --> 00:49:25,727
You lost a shoe.

863
00:49:28,162 --> 00:49:30,698
You're lucky it was
just the one.

864
00:49:30,765 --> 00:49:33,534
Snakes all around here.

865
00:49:33,601 --> 00:49:36,604
We need to talk to you about your nephew,
Mr. Van Wetter.

866
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:40,341
Little late for that,
isn't it?

867
00:49:40,408 --> 00:49:42,611
He gonna be strapped
to a chair and electrocuted.

868
00:49:42,678 --> 00:49:44,513
Well--

869
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:47,282
you come all the way up here
just to tell me that?

870
00:49:47,349 --> 00:49:49,017
You could've saved
yourself a trip.

871
00:49:49,084 --> 00:49:51,520
He tells me
that he was with you

872
00:49:51,587 --> 00:49:53,555
the night Sheriff Call
was murdered,

873
00:49:53,622 --> 00:49:55,457
stealing sod,
which you later sold.

874
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:00,029
Let's hope
nobody believes him.

875
00:50:00,095 --> 00:50:03,133
Stealing's against the law,
ain't it?

876
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:04,968
Now he's still got time.

877
00:50:09,939 --> 00:50:11,776
I don't much care
for you.

878
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,177
Come up here
in my home--

879
00:50:14,244 --> 00:50:16,312
and call me a thief.

880
00:50:18,416 --> 00:50:22,987
I ain't up here about thieving,
Mr. Van Wetter.

881
00:50:23,054 --> 00:50:27,725
I'm up here about whether a man's life
needs to be taken or not--

882
00:50:27,792 --> 00:50:29,660
for the murder
of Sheriff Call.

883
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,904
But if you was with your nephew
that night,

884
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:41,172
it's vital for Hillary
that you admit it.

885
00:50:42,674 --> 00:50:44,676
I don't think
he likes you much.

886
00:50:44,743 --> 00:50:46,178
I don't like him
much either.

887
00:50:53,252 --> 00:50:54,586
Where's the ice cream?

888
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:56,121
It's coming.

889
00:50:56,188 --> 00:50:57,690
Keep that baby quiet.

890
00:51:00,325 --> 00:51:02,128
What's wrong
with that baby?

891
00:51:03,696 --> 00:51:05,665
All right,
well, sit on it.

892
00:51:12,339 --> 00:51:13,207
Yeah.

893
00:51:18,645 --> 00:51:19,947
You want--?

894
00:51:21,548 --> 00:51:22,983
You want
a little ice cream?

895
00:51:26,388 --> 00:51:28,322
You don't want
to have any ice cream.

896
00:51:28,355 --> 00:51:30,624
You take this chair
out here with me.

897
00:51:34,294 --> 00:51:36,197
No sense you staying
over there.

898
00:51:37,232 --> 00:51:39,401
Thank you.

899
00:51:39,467 --> 00:51:41,469
Little man, get yourself
a chair there.

900
00:51:41,536 --> 00:51:42,570
Get yourself a chair.

901
00:51:47,176 --> 00:51:48,476
Was you with him?

902
00:51:48,543 --> 00:51:50,045
Yeah.

903
00:51:52,748 --> 00:51:54,016
Well, I--

904
00:51:54,082 --> 00:51:55,350
I was with him.

905
00:51:57,186 --> 00:51:58,187
Where?

906
00:52:01,424 --> 00:52:02,825
Golf club.

907
00:52:02,892 --> 00:52:04,693
Ormond Beach.

908
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:09,932
Stole sod, sold it--

909
00:52:11,401 --> 00:52:13,203
to this one
condo developer.

910
00:52:14,704 --> 00:52:16,406
Where's Hillary
live from here?

911
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,709
We didn't get back
till the morning, sunrise.

912
00:52:21,578 --> 00:52:22,979
He lives that way.

913
00:52:23,046 --> 00:52:24,881
So why are you
telling me now?

914
00:52:27,285 --> 00:52:30,855
You seem like the only person
thinks Hillary's innocent.

915
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:36,127
No, sir, Mr. Van Wetter.
No, sir.

916
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,462
I didn't say that.

917
00:52:39,363 --> 00:52:40,933
Your boy--

918
00:52:42,667 --> 00:52:44,335
he's getting
nervous over there.

919
00:52:44,402 --> 00:52:46,271
Let's go. I'm done
talking to you.

920
00:52:48,539 --> 00:52:50,341
What you hiding?
Ward?

921
00:52:50,408 --> 00:52:51,710
I'm sick--

922
00:52:51,777 --> 00:52:53,612
of your questions.

923
00:52:56,148 --> 00:52:57,416
Eugene?

924
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:08,227
Ward, remember the first day
when I was with Charlotte? Yeah?

925
00:53:08,293 --> 00:53:09,828
We went and stopped
at the prison.

926
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:12,999
We didn't go in.
I saw him.

927
00:53:13,066 --> 00:53:15,067
Tyree?
Yeah.

928
00:53:15,134 --> 00:53:17,771
What you think? They was getting
their stories together?

929
00:53:17,837 --> 00:53:19,172
I don't know.

930
00:53:20,306 --> 00:53:21,741
I'll tell you this.

931
00:53:21,808 --> 00:53:23,109
They ain't as dumb
as they look.

932
00:53:26,847 --> 00:53:28,581
Oh, shit, man.

933
00:53:30,518 --> 00:53:31,519
Fuck.

934
00:53:40,027 --> 00:53:42,096
What the fuck, man?

935
00:53:43,764 --> 00:53:45,467
Leave me
at the fucking hotel?

936
00:53:45,534 --> 00:53:47,069
Jesus!

937
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,536
In Yardley's room,
no less.

938
00:53:48,602 --> 00:53:49,770
Fuck, man.
Look at you.

939
00:53:53,208 --> 00:53:56,278
You're becoming obsessed
with this case.

940
00:53:56,344 --> 00:53:57,946
Wake me up.

941
00:54:00,717 --> 00:54:02,117
Wake me up.

942
00:54:02,184 --> 00:54:03,652
Come on.

943
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:05,455
You look terrible, Ward.

944
00:54:05,521 --> 00:54:08,490
Those mosquitoes eat
you for breakfast?

945
00:54:08,557 --> 00:54:10,827
Yardley found
the golf course.

946
00:54:10,893 --> 00:54:13,730
You found the golf course?
What's he doing in my clothes?

947
00:54:15,998 --> 00:54:17,400
The car broke down.

948
00:54:17,467 --> 00:54:19,135
we had to walk
into town,

949
00:54:19,202 --> 00:54:22,472
stopped by the motel
to freshen up.

950
00:54:22,538 --> 00:54:24,974
Get out of my clothes now.

951
00:54:28,678 --> 00:54:31,582
Come on.

952
00:54:31,648 --> 00:54:33,150
Come on, Jack.

953
00:54:33,217 --> 00:54:36,153
What are you doing?

954
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:37,988
Miss Bless.
Come on, stop it.

955
00:54:38,055 --> 00:54:39,223
Jack!

956
00:54:41,993 --> 00:54:43,894
On the morning
of the murder

957
00:54:43,961 --> 00:54:46,164
the grounds superintendent
of the Ormond Beach Golf Course

958
00:54:46,231 --> 00:54:47,665
phoned the
Police Department

959
00:54:47,732 --> 00:54:49,166
to report that four
of his greens

960
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:50,835
had been stripped
in the night.

961
00:54:50,902 --> 00:54:52,604
You talked to the
superintendent? No.

962
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:54,606
He died, but I found
another guy who remembered

963
00:54:54,672 --> 00:54:57,108
that the club
called the governor

964
00:54:57,175 --> 00:54:59,110
to ask him to declare them
a disaster area

965
00:54:59,177 --> 00:55:01,013
so they could get
federal funds

966
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,181
to replace the greens.

967
00:55:02,247 --> 00:55:03,882
It gets better.

968
00:55:03,948 --> 00:55:05,618
I found the builder, too,

969
00:55:05,684 --> 00:55:07,219
the guy who bought
the stolen greens.

970
00:55:07,286 --> 00:55:09,354
He remembered
Hillary and Tyree.

971
00:55:09,421 --> 00:55:11,690
They showed up
at 6 AM in a truck.

972
00:55:11,757 --> 00:55:13,893
He took one look at them
and what they had

973
00:55:13,959 --> 00:55:18,130
and thought they'd stolen
it from a cemetery.

974
00:55:18,197 --> 00:55:20,934
But of course, he doesn't want to
be connected to this in any way.

975
00:55:21,968 --> 00:55:23,569
And who was he?

976
00:55:23,636 --> 00:55:25,372
Well, the only way
he'd talk to me

977
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,973
is if I promised
to keep him anonymous.

978
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,709
Come on now.
What's his name?

979
00:55:28,775 --> 00:55:30,577
No, no, no.

980
00:55:30,644 --> 00:55:32,579
I've got to keep it anonymous.
I gave him my word.

981
00:55:32,646 --> 00:55:34,381
He's got, well,
he's in a position

982
00:55:34,448 --> 00:55:37,584
to get some work from the state,
so you know.

983
00:55:37,651 --> 00:55:40,321
But good, huh?

984
00:55:40,388 --> 00:55:41,823
Outstanding.

985
00:55:45,059 --> 00:55:46,928
How'd you find him?

986
00:55:46,994 --> 00:55:49,329
Building permits.

987
00:55:52,233 --> 00:55:54,168
Damn building permit.

988
00:55:57,338 --> 00:55:59,574
Time to get out of Lately.

989
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:02,810
Did you sleep
with Yardley?

990
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:07,516
You know, people
like Yardley, you just--

991
00:56:10,018 --> 00:56:13,622
got to get him
on your side.

992
00:56:13,689 --> 00:56:15,024
You know what I mean?

993
00:56:17,092 --> 00:56:18,861
You fucked him for that?

994
00:56:22,699 --> 00:56:26,369
Fucking a man is the most natural
thing in the world, Jack.

995
00:56:26,436 --> 00:56:27,704
It is.

996
00:56:29,706 --> 00:56:30,707
It is.

997
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,881
I kind of like it
out here.

998
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:44,789
This was
a good idea.

999
00:56:48,726 --> 00:56:49,894
Oooh!

1000
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,129
Come on!
Let's dance.

1001
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,234
Come on!
No!

1002
00:56:57,301 --> 00:57:00,405
Come on, Jack.
Got to have fun!

1003
00:57:05,977 --> 00:57:07,345
You wanna dance?

1004
00:57:07,412 --> 00:57:09,916
Yeah! I wanna dance
with you!

1005
00:57:16,222 --> 00:57:17,923
Woo! You're good!

1006
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,436
This is not me
apologizing, you dig?

1007
00:57:29,503 --> 00:57:31,671
I just don't like
to see you sad.

1008
00:57:44,418 --> 00:57:47,121
Yardley told their editor
about the new evidence

1009
00:57:47,187 --> 00:57:49,557
from Ormond Beach.

1010
00:57:49,624 --> 00:57:52,726
This was enough to show injustice
in the legal system of Lately

1011
00:57:52,793 --> 00:57:54,729
and enough for a good story.

1012
00:57:54,796 --> 00:57:57,231
Yardley wanted to get
out of town

1013
00:57:57,297 --> 00:57:58,799
and Ward knew it.

1014
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:09,545
All these peanuts
on the floor.

1015
00:58:09,612 --> 00:58:12,814
Pigs. Bunch of pigs
living around here.

1016
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:17,185
Sick of this shit.

1017
00:58:17,252 --> 00:58:19,555
I can't find
Mama's ring.

1018
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:23,325
Oh, well, a nigger
must have come

1019
00:58:23,392 --> 00:58:25,461
in the middle of the night
and stole it.

1020
00:58:34,671 --> 00:58:36,039
I'm sorry, Anita.

1021
00:58:36,106 --> 00:58:38,307
I didn't mean to say--

1022
00:58:40,077 --> 00:58:42,279
I didn't mean
to say that.

1023
00:58:42,345 --> 00:58:43,981
And I'm really sorry.

1024
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:48,752
You know, Jackie, you got to watch
your mouth.

1025
00:58:48,819 --> 00:58:52,322
Somebody'll cut your little ass
over some shit like that.

1026
00:58:55,193 --> 00:58:57,195
You understand me, boy?

1027
00:58:57,261 --> 00:58:58,295
Yes, ma'am.

1028
00:59:03,201 --> 00:59:05,470
And you miss
your mother?

1029
00:59:07,105 --> 00:59:09,308
Sometimes.

1030
00:59:09,374 --> 00:59:12,110
It's a dis-damn grace
the way she left you.

1031
00:59:16,715 --> 00:59:18,449
And I been here.

1032
00:59:22,287 --> 00:59:24,224
Well, let's find
this ring, I guess.

1033
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:26,892
No, that's all right.
I can find it.

1034
00:59:48,148 --> 00:59:49,517
Ohhh.
Sorry.

1035
00:59:49,583 --> 00:59:50,885
All right.

1036
00:59:52,585 --> 00:59:53,754
Okay.

1037
00:59:53,821 --> 00:59:56,490
I'm really sorry.
Okay.

1038
00:59:57,658 --> 01:00:00,594
All right, Jack.

1039
01:00:00,661 --> 01:00:02,930
What's makes
this story any different?

1040
01:00:02,997 --> 01:00:05,699
What makes your story different
than the others, John?

1041
01:00:05,766 --> 01:00:08,870
What makes this case so different that you
want to pull the plug now?

1042
01:00:08,937 --> 01:00:10,672
The facts.
What's left to do?

1043
01:00:10,739 --> 01:00:12,339
You've been up there
a month and a half.

1044
01:00:12,406 --> 01:00:14,009
I want
your ass back here.

1045
01:00:14,076 --> 01:00:16,011
Save that shit
for someone else.

1046
01:00:16,078 --> 01:00:18,345
I'm not comfortable with it
and you shouldn't be either.

1047
01:00:18,413 --> 01:00:20,115
I'm going to Ormond Beach
to get the facts.

1048
01:00:22,184 --> 01:00:25,787
I want to get some
alligator shoes.

1049
01:00:25,854 --> 01:00:29,058
You run this article,
this shit could hurt me.

1050
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:31,360
I got advertisers
to think of.

1051
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:34,397
A dvertisers? You want
me to be concerned

1052
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,566
with the advertisers
for your newspaper?

1053
01:00:36,632 --> 01:00:38,034
Ward, you don't
know everything.

1054
01:00:38,101 --> 01:00:39,535
He knows
what he's doing, Pa.

1055
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:41,370
Shut up! I'm not
talking to you.

1056
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:43,307
He knows
how to get stories,

1057
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:45,408
but what he doesn't
fully appreciate

1058
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:48,412
is that the stories
go out into a community.

1059
01:00:48,479 --> 01:00:49,713
They resonate.

1060
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:51,482
Oh, like the jellyfish?

1061
01:00:51,548 --> 01:00:53,984
Like getting pissed on?

1062
01:00:54,051 --> 01:00:57,087
You notice Anita's been acting
mighty bossy recently?

1063
01:00:59,123 --> 01:01:01,925
She's always been
that way. Yeah.

1064
01:01:04,396 --> 01:01:06,663
Oh, shit.

1065
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:09,334
Darling, let it go.
Don't get yourself hurt.

1066
01:01:09,401 --> 01:01:11,935
Sit down.
I'll get Anita. Anita!

1067
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:14,239
Hey, I'll take
care of it.

1068
01:01:14,305 --> 01:01:17,475
Anita will get it. Anita! Does she
have children? I can't remember.

1069
01:01:19,344 --> 01:01:23,082
She got two kids.
Oh, yeah.

1070
01:01:26,985 --> 01:01:28,687
How you doing, baby doll?
Where you going?

1071
01:01:28,754 --> 01:01:30,623
Hoo.
A baby shower.

1072
01:01:30,689 --> 01:01:32,791
Um, Anita, uh,
before you go,

1073
01:01:32,857 --> 01:01:34,794
could you clean
up this mess.

1074
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:37,129
I said I got it. It's all right.
Anita's got it.

1075
01:01:40,866 --> 01:01:41,867
I got it.

1076
01:01:42,868 --> 01:01:44,271
I got it.

1077
01:01:44,337 --> 01:01:46,072
We're going
to Ormond Beach.

1078
01:01:46,138 --> 01:01:49,543
Oh, just come right
out and tell them.

1079
01:01:49,609 --> 01:01:52,979
I've named Ellen
editor-in-chief.

1080
01:01:57,017 --> 01:01:59,386
And--

1081
01:01:59,453 --> 01:02:00,654
we're getting married.

1082
01:02:10,865 --> 01:02:12,632
It's an antique.

1083
01:02:12,699 --> 01:02:14,902
I know it is.

1084
01:02:14,969 --> 01:02:18,407
This belonged
to my mother.

1085
01:02:18,474 --> 01:02:21,242
It was a gift from me.
Give it back, Jack.

1086
01:02:21,309 --> 01:02:23,645
Just give it
back to her.

1087
01:02:23,712 --> 01:02:25,748
It's all I got.

1088
01:02:25,813 --> 01:02:27,916
Ward never believed
Yardley's story.

1089
01:02:27,983 --> 01:02:29,952
Building permits
and anonymous sources.

1090
01:02:30,018 --> 01:02:32,688
He took Charlotte and Jack
back to Ormond Beach

1091
01:02:32,755 --> 01:02:34,690
to get
to the bottom of it.

1092
01:02:34,757 --> 01:02:36,759
Yardley went back home
to Miami.

1093
01:02:36,825 --> 01:02:38,995
# That man is dangerous #

1094
01:02:40,763 --> 01:02:43,166
# Loving him is dangerous #

1095
01:02:45,769 --> 01:02:47,536
# That man is dangerous #

1096
01:02:49,939 --> 01:02:51,708
# Loving him is dangerous #

1097
01:02:54,511 --> 01:02:56,179
# That man is dangerous #

1098
01:02:57,882 --> 01:02:59,783
What is that builder's name,
Charlotte?

1099
01:02:59,849 --> 01:03:01,718
What builder?

1100
01:03:01,785 --> 01:03:03,788
You know
exactly what builder.

1101
01:03:03,854 --> 01:03:06,222
The one Yardley
says bought the sod.

1102
01:03:06,289 --> 01:03:07,625
I don't know.
He went alone.

1103
01:03:07,691 --> 01:03:10,661
I went
to the hairdresser's.

1104
01:03:10,728 --> 01:03:12,396
Takes a lot
to look like this.

1105
01:03:12,464 --> 01:03:16,133
Charlotte Bless,
you is a mess.

1106
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,403
And you'd do anything
to get your man

1107
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:21,806
out of jail--
wouldn't you?

1108
01:03:26,278 --> 01:03:27,746
Thirsty, huh?

1109
01:03:27,813 --> 01:03:28,980
Oh, yeah.

1110
01:03:29,047 --> 01:03:32,050
# That man is dangerous #

1111
01:03:32,117 --> 01:03:34,486
You keep staring
like that,

1112
01:03:34,553 --> 01:03:37,222
we're gonna have
a problem.

1113
01:03:37,289 --> 01:03:40,092
What really happened
down there, Charlotte?

1114
01:03:40,158 --> 01:03:42,495
After you went to the hairdresser,
what happened? Hm?

1115
01:03:42,562 --> 01:03:44,964
Jack, would you tell your brother to get
his hands off of me?

1116
01:03:44,997 --> 01:03:48,000
Come on, man. Let's go somewhere else.
Easy, little brother.

1117
01:03:48,067 --> 01:03:50,236
Just fucking relax, boy.

1118
01:03:50,303 --> 01:03:52,406
Miss Bless ain't got
no answer, huh?

1119
01:03:55,341 --> 01:03:56,409
I didn't think so.

1120
01:04:00,513 --> 01:04:02,282
Your brother's
acting strange.

1121
01:04:02,349 --> 01:04:04,685
Not used to drinking
like this.

1122
01:04:04,752 --> 01:04:07,287
# Is this love affair for real
Or is it just one and done? #

1123
01:04:07,354 --> 01:04:09,356
# I'm telling you #

1124
01:04:09,423 --> 01:04:10,958
A little more
than that.

1125
01:04:18,833 --> 01:04:20,167
Why is Ward doing this?

1126
01:04:22,203 --> 01:04:24,272
We got 50 places
to be tomorrow.

1127
01:04:32,882 --> 01:04:34,382
What is that?

1128
01:04:35,884 --> 01:04:37,119
It's beautiful.

1129
01:04:39,622 --> 01:04:42,391
Don't turn it down.

1130
01:04:42,458 --> 01:04:45,194
No one's ever given me
something like this before.

1131
01:04:51,467 --> 01:04:54,537
Well, you just tell me
when you want it back, huh?

1132
01:04:56,138 --> 01:04:58,041
It's beautiful.

1133
01:05:14,858 --> 01:05:18,696
You want me
to fuck you, Jack?

1134
01:05:18,763 --> 01:05:22,533
Then I'm gonna fuck you
any way you want.

1135
01:05:25,937 --> 01:05:27,872
Jack.

1136
01:05:29,674 --> 01:05:31,777
Jack!

1137
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:36,047
I want to get
some alligator shoes.

1138
01:05:36,114 --> 01:05:38,217
Mmm, Jack.

1139
01:05:38,283 --> 01:05:41,018
You wanted
your ass whupped.

1140
01:05:41,085 --> 01:05:42,554
Is that what you wanted?

1141
01:05:42,621 --> 01:05:44,189
Tell me
what you want.

1142
01:05:44,256 --> 01:05:45,824
You're a dirty pig.

1143
01:05:45,891 --> 01:05:48,060
I'll fuck you
any way you want.

1144
01:05:48,127 --> 01:05:50,529
Little white pig.

1145
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:56,636
Jack? Jack! Jack!

1146
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:57,737
Jack, wake up!

1147
01:05:59,339 --> 01:06:01,106
Something's going
on in Ward's room.

1148
01:06:27,235 --> 01:06:28,969
Hey! Hey!

1149
01:06:29,036 --> 01:06:30,771
Stop it!

1150
01:06:30,838 --> 01:06:32,040
What the fuck?

1151
01:06:35,810 --> 01:06:38,013
Help!
We need help!

1152
01:07:14,518 --> 01:07:16,386
Where's the fucking keys?

1153
01:07:16,453 --> 01:07:18,655
Where's the fucking keys,
you piece of shit?

1154
01:07:18,722 --> 01:07:20,657
Motherfucker, wake up!

1155
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:24,395
Help!

1156
01:07:26,965 --> 01:07:29,066
Where are
the fucking keys?

1157
01:07:29,133 --> 01:07:30,868
Ward, what's
the plastic for?

1158
01:07:33,171 --> 01:07:34,739
What is the plastic?

1159
01:07:40,245 --> 01:07:42,647
What the fuck?

1160
01:08:02,068 --> 01:08:04,370
I've watched you so often.

1161
01:08:04,437 --> 01:08:07,441
You sit here, and I heard
that you play a little drum.

1162
01:08:07,507 --> 01:08:10,342
You didn't get up
and do anything. No.

1163
01:08:10,409 --> 01:08:12,079
I heard you could sing,

1164
01:08:12,145 --> 01:08:13,713
but with me you
are going to sing.

1165
01:08:18,351 --> 01:08:19,953
He's gonna be fine.

1166
01:08:59,094 --> 01:09:01,631
You don't have to sleep
all the way down there.

1167
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:32,263
All right.

1168
01:09:32,329 --> 01:09:34,031
Just this once.

1169
01:09:41,673 --> 01:09:44,675
I can't fuck
with this TV on.

1170
01:09:48,346 --> 01:09:50,281
Feels kind of awkward
to be talking

1171
01:09:50,347 --> 01:09:51,817
while you see this.

1172
01:09:58,056 --> 01:10:01,828
But it's kind of awkward that
they're doing it in the first place.

1173
01:10:07,734 --> 01:10:09,968
Most boys Jack's age
fall in love

1174
01:10:10,035 --> 01:10:12,305
with their high school
or college sweetheart,

1175
01:10:12,371 --> 01:10:15,007
but Jack never bothered
much with girls

1176
01:10:15,074 --> 01:10:16,309
after his mama left.

1177
01:10:21,248 --> 01:10:24,083
I guess you could say
he had abandonment issues.

1178
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:27,254
With Charlotte, it was like he
was getting his mama,

1179
01:10:27,321 --> 01:10:30,858
his high school sweetheart,
and a oversexed Barbie doll

1180
01:10:30,924 --> 01:10:32,760
all rolled into one.

1181
01:10:38,332 --> 01:10:41,369
Anywho, I think
y'all seen enough.

1182
01:10:44,505 --> 01:10:47,442
My hair looks like crap.
Don't even look at it.

1183
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:49,210
Oh, shit.

1184
01:10:49,277 --> 01:10:51,713
I got to go
to the hairdresser.

1185
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:54,616
My wig
ain't acting right.

1186
01:10:54,682 --> 01:10:56,085
I don't understand
what the fuck

1187
01:10:56,152 --> 01:10:57,786
you're doing
with Hillary.

1188
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:02,291
Oh.

1189
01:11:04,225 --> 01:11:05,895
Here we go.

1190
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:07,530
You don't
love him.

1191
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:10,733
Really?
M m-hm.

1192
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,134
You don't know that.

1193
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:16,506
You don't know anything.

1194
01:11:16,573 --> 01:11:18,741
You're 20 years old.
You're not that much older.

1195
01:11:20,077 --> 01:11:21,745
I'm a lot older.

1196
01:11:23,313 --> 01:11:25,315
It ain't gonna happen.

1197
01:11:25,382 --> 01:11:26,550
Look at me.

1198
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:28,151
It's not practical.

1199
01:11:28,218 --> 01:11:30,554
I'm not as practical
as the murderer?

1200
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:32,756
He's not guilty, Jack.
That's the point.

1201
01:11:32,823 --> 01:11:35,059
That's not the point.
Fuck this. I knew it would happen.

1202
01:11:35,126 --> 01:11:36,561
What?

1203
01:11:36,627 --> 01:11:38,261
I give you some ass
and suddenly--

1204
01:11:40,665 --> 01:11:44,267
Look--Hillary
ain't so bad.

1205
01:11:44,334 --> 01:11:46,604
And I'm not so good.

1206
01:11:46,671 --> 01:11:49,173
I've got another side.

1207
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:50,975
I got a fucked-up side,

1208
01:11:51,042 --> 01:11:53,010
and it gets along
just fine with my man.

1209
01:11:53,077 --> 01:11:54,947
You can't split
yourself into sides.

1210
01:11:55,013 --> 01:11:56,882
Sure, you can.
Just ask your brother.

1211
01:11:56,949 --> 01:11:59,117
What the fuck does Ward
have to do with this?

1212
01:11:59,183 --> 01:12:01,186
He has a dark side and I don't mean
him being a fag.

1213
01:12:01,253 --> 01:12:05,124
Now these boys
lived for each other.

1214
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:09,428
Jack wasn't hurt by Ward
being a homosexual

1215
01:12:09,495 --> 01:12:12,364
or the dark stuff
that he was into.

1216
01:12:12,431 --> 01:12:15,802
He was just hurt
that Ward never told him.

1217
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:23,042
Hi.
Hey, there.

1218
01:12:25,111 --> 01:12:27,514
H e's doing better.
He's gonna be all right. Good.

1219
01:12:28,882 --> 01:12:30,217
So, I gotta go.

1220
01:12:31,985 --> 01:12:33,553
Go where?
Where you going?

1221
01:12:34,722 --> 01:12:36,290
I'm going back home.

1222
01:12:38,892 --> 01:12:40,494
You don't have
to go anywhere.

1223
01:12:40,561 --> 01:12:43,330
It's just the way
it works.

1224
01:12:43,397 --> 01:12:45,299
You shouldn't go anywhere
you don't want to go.

1225
01:12:50,739 --> 01:12:52,406
Who says
I don't want to go?

1226
01:12:54,008 --> 01:12:55,243
Why do you have to go?

1227
01:12:57,245 --> 01:12:58,479
'Cause I do.

1228
01:12:59,915 --> 01:13:01,550
Take this ring back.

1229
01:13:03,318 --> 01:13:04,853
Yardley called
the hotel.

1230
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:06,788
Did you tell him?

1231
01:13:06,855 --> 01:13:09,091
I told him Ward got mugged
and beaten on the beach.

1232
01:13:12,761 --> 01:13:14,096
Well, what'd he say?

1233
01:13:14,162 --> 01:13:16,532
Not much.

1234
01:13:16,599 --> 01:13:18,600
Wanted to know
if he was gonna make it.

1235
01:13:18,667 --> 01:13:21,003
When I told him
it wasn't serious,

1236
01:13:21,070 --> 01:13:24,341
he kind of just lost interest.
He's not gonna be much help for a while.

1237
01:13:24,408 --> 01:13:27,443
Didn't sound like he needed
much help.

1238
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:29,947
He can't go write the story
alone, Charlotte.

1239
01:13:30,013 --> 01:13:33,049
Well, we'll just have to see.
He doesn't know enough about it.

1240
01:13:33,116 --> 01:13:34,918
This isn't about
a newspaper article, Jack.

1241
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:36,520
It's about
a person's life.

1242
01:13:36,587 --> 01:13:38,221
That's the whole point
we're here, okay?

1243
01:13:38,287 --> 01:13:40,057
So it's about
someone's life.

1244
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:45,696
Baby, don't go.

1245
01:13:45,763 --> 01:13:47,898
You're starting to screw
with my head.

1246
01:13:49,801 --> 01:13:51,702
Look, you're a good kid,
all right?

1247
01:13:51,769 --> 01:13:54,906
You're--

1248
01:13:54,973 --> 01:13:58,242
You got your whole life
ahead of you,

1249
01:13:58,308 --> 01:13:59,778
and you want me?

1250
01:14:05,283 --> 01:14:07,385
Jack went down
to "The Miami Times"

1251
01:14:07,452 --> 01:14:09,822
to try to stop Yardley
from publishing the article.

1252
01:14:12,323 --> 01:14:14,427
He didn't want
his brother's name on it.

1253
01:14:15,327 --> 01:14:16,996
Jack.

1254
01:14:18,596 --> 01:14:20,332
Hi.

1255
01:14:20,399 --> 01:14:24,337
Hey. How's Ward?
How's your brother doing?

1256
01:14:24,404 --> 01:14:26,439
Been trying to get ahold
of you since yesterday.

1257
01:14:26,505 --> 01:14:29,109
Good. He's obviously
not doing so badly then.

1258
01:14:29,176 --> 01:14:34,114
Sorry, I didn't want
any distractions. Come, sit, sit.

1259
01:14:34,181 --> 01:14:36,516
He wants to read
what you're writing.

1260
01:14:36,583 --> 01:14:39,119
A s soon as I'm done, he'll be the first
to read it, as always.

1261
01:14:39,152 --> 01:14:42,289
Damn it! I'm so sick
of your shit, man!

1262
01:14:42,355 --> 01:14:44,225
His name
is on that, too.

1263
01:14:44,292 --> 01:14:47,294
He wants to read it
before it's published.

1264
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,130
Okay? That's it.
Uh-huh.

1265
01:14:49,197 --> 01:14:51,799
He just wants to read it
before it's published.

1266
01:14:51,865 --> 01:14:53,968
You got to get
those facts straight.

1267
01:14:54,035 --> 01:14:56,304
You got to get
all the facts straight.

1268
01:14:56,370 --> 01:14:58,973
You're starting to sound
like your brother.

1269
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,609
Look, we have
a deadline here.

1270
01:15:01,676 --> 01:15:03,611
I've told you, this is
the newspaper business.

1271
01:15:03,678 --> 01:15:05,379
We don't have time
to get all the facts.

1272
01:15:05,446 --> 01:15:08,216
We both know the town
of Lately set Hillary up.

1273
01:15:08,282 --> 01:15:11,386
We've got the story.
It's not the fucking truth!

1274
01:15:11,453 --> 01:15:14,189
You want to talk
about the motherfucking truth?

1275
01:15:17,726 --> 01:15:20,729
You thought
I was from London?

1276
01:15:20,796 --> 01:15:22,831
Ain't no Negro getting
a job up in this spot

1277
01:15:22,898 --> 01:15:26,201
unless he's a colored
motherfucking James Bond, you dig?

1278
01:15:28,203 --> 01:15:31,174
I got drunk once
and let Ward suck my dick.

1279
01:15:33,041 --> 01:15:35,311
He got a taste for niggers
and now he hates himself.

1280
01:15:35,378 --> 01:15:36,746
That's the truth.

1281
01:15:39,549 --> 01:15:41,351
Go back
to your brother, boy.

1282
01:15:44,922 --> 01:15:47,524
I have got
a deadline to meet.

1283
01:16:23,463 --> 01:16:25,565
Hello?

1284
01:16:25,631 --> 01:16:29,202
Put Ward
on the phone.

1285
01:16:29,268 --> 01:16:32,071
Why'd you put his byline
on that article?

1286
01:16:32,138 --> 01:16:33,806
How could you sign
his name on that?

1287
01:16:33,873 --> 01:16:35,875
Tell him we got
Hillary out.

1288
01:16:35,942 --> 01:16:37,744
The governor's
gonna pardon him.

1289
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,749
Hillary's getting out.

1290
01:16:46,285 --> 01:16:48,388
"I've had some time to think
over the past few months

1291
01:16:48,455 --> 01:16:51,992
about me,
about you.

1292
01:16:52,059 --> 01:16:54,661
I'm not sure I found
what I want out of life yet.

1293
01:16:54,728 --> 01:16:58,333
All I know is that I don't want
to live it without you.

1294
01:16:58,399 --> 01:17:01,235
Please take this ring back.
Love, Jack. "

1295
01:17:09,310 --> 01:17:10,845
Get the door.

1296
01:17:14,749 --> 01:17:17,585
Get the fucking
door, bitch!

1297
01:17:32,701 --> 01:17:34,804
Who the fuck are you?

1298
01:17:34,870 --> 01:17:36,772
I'm Hillary.
What you want?

1299
01:17:36,839 --> 01:17:38,475
Get the fuck out!
I'm with Charlotte.

1300
01:17:38,542 --> 01:17:40,209
That bitch took my--
I'll call you later!

1301
01:17:43,513 --> 01:17:46,149
Charlotte, you want me
to call the police?

1302
01:17:55,625 --> 01:17:57,561
There she is.

1303
01:17:58,863 --> 01:18:00,230
I'm sorry.

1304
01:18:00,297 --> 01:18:01,898
I was gonna write
you a letter--

1305
01:18:01,965 --> 01:18:04,335
No, I don't need
your letters. Come here.

1306
01:18:09,474 --> 01:18:10,675
Uh--

1307
01:18:17,816 --> 01:18:19,218
Don't touch me.

1308
01:18:19,284 --> 01:18:20,985
Come on here.
Don't touch you?

1309
01:18:23,422 --> 01:18:24,690
Don't touch you?

1310
01:18:27,325 --> 01:18:29,228
It's okay.

1311
01:18:30,395 --> 01:18:31,363
It's all right, baby.

1312
01:18:45,912 --> 01:18:46,946
Anything.

1313
01:18:55,955 --> 01:18:56,756
That's all right.

1314
01:19:14,475 --> 01:19:16,710
You told me you loved me
in your third letter.

1315
01:19:16,777 --> 01:19:18,814
Do you love me?

1316
01:19:20,282 --> 01:19:21,248
Yes!

1317
01:19:45,174 --> 01:19:48,177
You always fuck
like this?

1318
01:19:48,244 --> 01:19:49,912
Like it was
the last time?

1319
01:19:56,919 --> 01:19:58,856
Do you think I'm pretty?

1320
01:19:58,922 --> 01:20:00,390
You fuck
those niggers like this?

1321
01:20:08,265 --> 01:20:11,001
Gonna get all inside here!

1322
01:20:14,272 --> 01:20:16,473
Now pack your shit
and let's go.

1323
01:20:22,881 --> 01:20:26,117
I don't think I'm gonna like
living in a swamp.

1324
01:20:26,184 --> 01:20:30,221
I don't want to live in a swamp.
I like it here.

1325
01:20:32,792 --> 01:20:37,163
And that was
their declaration of love.

1326
01:20:37,229 --> 01:20:39,965
So Hillary took
Charlotte to the swamp.

1327
01:20:52,379 --> 01:20:55,681
So did you hear
about old man Henry? No.

1328
01:20:55,748 --> 01:20:58,418
He got drunk in his back yard
by the water,

1329
01:20:58,485 --> 01:21:01,455
and the alligators came out and took
a big chunk of his leg.

1330
01:21:02,889 --> 01:21:04,825
Ha. Just joking.

1331
01:21:06,493 --> 01:21:08,195
My daddy rooster,
he got jumped

1332
01:21:08,261 --> 01:21:09,996
by three of his sons,

1333
01:21:10,063 --> 01:21:13,034
so I need to find a home
for three of them.

1334
01:21:13,101 --> 01:21:15,202
So he's
in my house sitting,

1335
01:21:15,268 --> 01:21:17,338
so I need--I know
you only have hens.

1336
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:19,841
That's why I was wondering,
you know, if you want to babysit,

1337
01:21:19,907 --> 01:21:22,110
you know, adopt three
of them for you.

1338
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:25,847
But they'd be good though,
because you have hens. No.

1339
01:21:25,913 --> 01:21:29,317
You're my only hope.
No! I don't want any.

1340
01:21:29,383 --> 01:21:30,685
Come on, Charlotte.

1341
01:21:30,752 --> 01:21:32,554
I need you
to do me a favor.

1342
01:21:32,621 --> 01:21:34,223
I need you to post
this thing for me.

1343
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:36,357
It ain't got
a stamp on it.

1344
01:21:36,424 --> 01:21:38,026
What's wrong with you today?
It's real important.

1345
01:21:38,093 --> 01:21:39,628
You think you can do
that for me?

1346
01:21:39,695 --> 01:21:41,463
You're not acting
yourself today.

1347
01:21:46,368 --> 01:21:49,204
Why's your door open, huh?

1348
01:21:51,875 --> 01:21:53,343
Smells like piss
in here.

1349
01:21:53,443 --> 01:21:56,078
Ward Ward said
you might show up.

1350
01:21:56,145 --> 01:21:57,480
Left him a note.

1351
01:21:58,815 --> 01:22:00,583
You stink.

1352
01:22:00,650 --> 01:22:02,318
I can smell you
from over here.

1353
01:22:02,385 --> 01:22:05,588
Come here, boy.
Come sit down.

1354
01:22:05,655 --> 01:22:07,725
What you doing
back in Miami?

1355
01:22:11,829 --> 01:22:13,297
Yardley's gone.

1356
01:22:14,331 --> 01:22:15,498
He quit?

1357
01:22:15,565 --> 01:22:17,001
No.

1358
01:22:19,770 --> 01:22:21,439
He's in New York.

1359
01:22:23,174 --> 01:22:25,276
Signing some book deal.

1360
01:22:25,342 --> 01:22:29,513
Hero of the new journalism
or some kind of shit. I don't know.

1361
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:32,417
W.W. moved Ellen
into the house, huh?

1362
01:22:34,419 --> 01:22:35,686
Whatever.

1363
01:22:37,189 --> 01:22:39,257
Whatever makes him happy.

1364
01:23:06,987 --> 01:23:09,056
There wasn't
no developer, Jack.

1365
01:23:15,995 --> 01:23:17,664
All right, let's move.

1366
01:23:19,133 --> 01:23:20,234
Come on,
go shower, Ward.

1367
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:22,303
I'm tired.

1368
01:23:24,404 --> 01:23:25,572
Come on.

1369
01:23:27,509 --> 01:23:29,476
Jeez.

1370
01:23:43,191 --> 01:23:45,527
I keep thinking
I missed something, Jack.

1371
01:23:50,098 --> 01:23:51,901
Like I missed something
I was supposed to see

1372
01:23:51,967 --> 01:23:53,602
that was right
in front of me.

1373
01:23:53,669 --> 01:23:55,137
Like what?

1374
01:23:58,374 --> 01:23:59,942
The point of it.

1375
01:24:01,111 --> 01:24:02,546
Doesn't matter.

1376
01:24:04,713 --> 01:24:06,950
Things got out of hand.

1377
01:24:07,017 --> 01:24:08,985
You got hurt,

1378
01:24:09,085 --> 01:24:11,555
Yardley got
his fucking book deal.

1379
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:15,893
Hillary got Charlotte
in the swamp.

1380
01:24:18,028 --> 01:24:22,700
The idea--is that--
you run the water

1381
01:24:22,767 --> 01:24:23,967
while you're
in there with it.

1382
01:24:25,469 --> 01:24:26,637
Come on, man.

1383
01:24:33,978 --> 01:24:35,313
Hey.

1384
01:24:42,988 --> 01:24:45,656
What if we didn't get
it right, huh?

1385
01:24:46,892 --> 01:24:48,360
Makes no difference.

1386
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:50,061
It makes no difference,
Jack?

1387
01:24:50,128 --> 01:24:51,597
You don't know
what it feels like

1388
01:24:51,697 --> 01:24:53,932
to get it
exactly right now.

1389
01:24:53,999 --> 01:24:57,870
To get it down just
the way it happened.

1390
01:24:57,936 --> 01:24:59,571
You're going
back to see Hillary.

1391
01:24:59,638 --> 01:25:01,141
Fuck yeah, I am.

1392
01:25:01,241 --> 01:25:03,842
Do you ever hear
from her?

1393
01:25:03,909 --> 01:25:05,244
No.

1394
01:25:05,310 --> 01:25:07,247
Miss Bless?
No.

1395
01:25:07,313 --> 01:25:09,682
I wonder what she thinks
of him now, huh?

1396
01:25:11,851 --> 01:25:13,953
Can't see her sitting
on the porch stoop

1397
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:16,090
holding a silver spoon

1398
01:25:16,157 --> 01:25:18,625
and waiting for the ice cream carton
to come her way, can you?

1399
01:25:21,328 --> 01:25:23,097
I dug around.

1400
01:25:23,164 --> 01:25:25,599
There wasn't no proof,
no how, nowhere

1401
01:25:25,666 --> 01:25:28,969
that they was ever
stealing sod that night.

1402
01:25:29,036 --> 01:25:32,973
They want me
to keep my mouth shut.

1403
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:36,812
Don't want me to tell my story.
Well, fuck them.

1404
01:25:36,878 --> 01:25:39,647
I'm gonna tell my story.
I'm gonna write my story,

1405
01:25:39,713 --> 01:25:42,818
and they can publish it
wherever the fuck they want to.

1406
01:25:50,559 --> 01:25:53,562
Yeah, Mama always said
you better be--

1407
01:25:53,628 --> 01:25:59,801
right and be last before you gonna be
first and be wrong, boy.

1408
01:25:59,868 --> 01:26:03,139
Be right and be last before you go
gonna be first and be wrong--

1409
01:26:03,206 --> 01:26:04,439
Yeah, I know!

1410
01:26:29,233 --> 01:26:31,268
I heard--
They said things about--

1411
01:26:31,335 --> 01:26:33,370
Oh, yeah.
It's all true.

1412
01:26:33,437 --> 01:26:36,508
Just kidding.
You should see the other guy.

1413
01:26:36,574 --> 01:26:39,777
Smile.
Smile.

1414
01:26:39,843 --> 01:26:40,945
Thank you.

1415
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:49,554
Everyone, please.
We're cutting the cake!

1416
01:26:49,621 --> 01:26:51,089
Where's the photographer?

1417
01:26:53,358 --> 01:26:54,826
Hey, Claire,
can you hand me

1418
01:26:54,893 --> 01:26:57,729
that salt over there?

1419
01:26:57,796 --> 01:26:58,763
Thank you.

1420
01:27:00,599 --> 01:27:01,967
Hi.

1421
01:27:04,402 --> 01:27:05,971
You ain't supposed
to be in here.

1422
01:27:06,038 --> 01:27:07,773
You gonna get me in--
I got you a drink.

1423
01:27:11,877 --> 01:27:15,315
You know
W. W. fired me.

1424
01:27:15,382 --> 01:27:17,083
I'm gonna talk
to your boss

1425
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:18,884
and tell him you're a friend
of the family.

1426
01:27:18,951 --> 01:27:20,787
No, Jack.
Yeah.

1427
01:27:20,854 --> 01:27:22,756
All I ever did was cook
and clean for you boys.

1428
01:27:22,823 --> 01:27:24,890
I wasn't never no family.

1429
01:27:24,958 --> 01:27:28,095
Anyway, go on back outside.

1430
01:27:28,161 --> 01:27:31,565
Well, Ward's out there.
You gonna come see him?

1431
01:27:31,631 --> 01:27:33,934
Are you trying
to get me fired?

1432
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,303
I miss you.

1433
01:27:40,007 --> 01:27:42,743
I got something for you.
Wait a minute.

1434
01:27:52,086 --> 01:27:53,955
This came for you
about a month ago.

1435
01:27:54,021 --> 01:27:55,791
She told him to tell-

1436
01:27:55,858 --> 01:27:59,627
She told him
not to let you see it.

1437
01:27:59,694 --> 01:28:02,164
"Dear Jack,
I can't believe

1438
01:28:02,264 --> 01:28:04,900
I'm finally writing you
this letter

1439
01:28:04,967 --> 01:28:06,535
or if it will get to you

1440
01:28:06,602 --> 01:28:09,404
or whether
you'll even read it.

1441
01:28:09,471 --> 01:28:12,708
Jack, I think I've really
messed up this time.

1442
01:28:12,775 --> 01:28:14,243
Don't misunderstand me.

1443
01:28:14,343 --> 01:28:16,546
Hillary lo ves me,
in his way.

1444
01:28:16,613 --> 01:28:18,881
It's just me that isn't made
for this place,

1445
01:28:18,947 --> 01:28:21,451
for this lifestyle.

1446
01:28:21,551 --> 01:28:24,387
I hope I can make it
to your father's wedding

1447
01:28:24,454 --> 01:28:29,827
so I can hear you tell me,
'I told you so.'

1448
01:28:29,894 --> 01:28:34,632
Take care for now.
Sweetly, your Charlotte. "

1449
01:28:38,169 --> 01:28:40,004
Is that from blondie?

1450
01:28:48,179 --> 01:28:49,213
Thank you.

1451
01:28:51,349 --> 01:28:52,817
Where's your hat?

1452
01:28:52,883 --> 01:28:54,586
Oh, I forgot.
Get out of the kitchen.

1453
01:28:54,653 --> 01:28:56,421
I'm sorry.

1454
01:28:56,488 --> 01:28:58,557
Excuse me. I'm Jack Jansen.
I'm the groom's son.

1455
01:28:58,623 --> 01:29:01,092
My father wants to know
what exactly is taking dinner so long.

1456
01:29:01,193 --> 01:29:02,994
It'll be ready in a minute, sir.
Thank you.

1457
01:29:03,061 --> 01:29:05,864
Put the hair
under the hat.

1458
01:29:05,931 --> 01:29:08,333
I don't want your black hair
in my food.

1459
01:29:12,170 --> 01:29:13,872
You can put your black hair
in my food.

1460
01:29:19,378 --> 01:29:20,613
Cheers.

1461
01:29:26,185 --> 01:29:27,553
Bye, Anita.

1462
01:29:38,132 --> 01:29:39,466
Bye, Jack.

1463
01:29:57,585 --> 01:29:59,554
You wouldn't leave
without me, would you?

1464
01:29:59,654 --> 01:30:02,724
Drop you off at the motel.
I'm going somewhere.

1465
01:30:02,791 --> 01:30:05,261
Mind me asking where
you're going afterwards?

1466
01:30:05,327 --> 01:30:06,594
Going to Charlotte's.

1467
01:30:06,661 --> 01:30:08,229
Well, it gotta be tonight?

1468
01:30:08,296 --> 01:30:09,765
I got to get her
the fuck out of there.

1469
01:30:09,832 --> 01:30:11,400
I got to get her
out of there!

1470
01:30:11,467 --> 01:30:13,101
Charlotte's acting
on her own free will.

1471
01:30:13,168 --> 01:30:14,637
What do you want me
to say? Move.

1472
01:30:14,737 --> 01:30:16,272
I got to go
to the Van Wetters' anyway.

1473
01:30:16,338 --> 01:30:17,973
Come with me
tomorrow morning.

1474
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:20,075
We're going now.
It ain't the right time.

1475
01:30:20,142 --> 01:30:22,478
Get the fuck out my way.
You ain't driving drunk like this.

1476
01:30:22,545 --> 01:30:24,314
What the fuck are you gonna
do about it, huh?

1477
01:30:25,816 --> 01:30:26,982
What?

1478
01:30:35,358 --> 01:30:37,527
Charlotte must be
a good piece of ass.

1479
01:30:37,594 --> 01:30:40,363
You look like a pirate.
I know.

1480
01:30:40,430 --> 01:30:42,799
Do this for me
one time. Go "Aargh. "

1481
01:30:42,866 --> 01:30:43,500
Uh-huh.

1482
01:30:46,269 --> 01:30:49,040
Hey, you're driving
all squirrelly, man.

1483
01:30:49,107 --> 01:30:51,342
Hey, Jack,
sit on down. Hey.

1484
01:30:57,715 --> 01:31:00,151
You sure
it's this way?

1485
01:31:00,218 --> 01:31:01,519
I'm sure
it's this way.

1486
01:31:04,123 --> 01:31:06,891
Ain't a good time to be drinking
too much out here, Jack.

1487
01:31:08,359 --> 01:31:10,162
Yeah, you're one to talk.

1488
01:31:10,229 --> 01:31:12,498
Keeping your promise
to Dad, did you?

1489
01:31:12,564 --> 01:31:14,233
Not to drink
on his big day?

1490
01:31:14,299 --> 01:31:17,069
How you holding up?

1491
01:31:17,136 --> 01:31:19,739
Let's see your hands.
Are they shaking?

1492
01:31:19,805 --> 01:31:24,677
They shaking, Ward, huh?
Don't drink.

1493
01:31:24,744 --> 01:31:28,080
Well, why do you take
after the worst of me, Jack?

1494
01:31:30,483 --> 01:31:32,085
'Cause you're my brother.

1495
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:42,395
Wedding party, Charlotte?

1496
01:31:42,462 --> 01:31:43,864
I'm going
to the wedding.

1497
01:31:43,931 --> 01:31:45,599
Don't be difficult.
I told you--

1498
01:31:45,666 --> 01:31:47,333
I don't want you to go.

1499
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:49,437
No. I told you. I'm going to
the wedding.

1500
01:31:50,604 --> 01:31:51,572
Watch out.

1501
01:31:53,507 --> 01:31:54,942
God, it smells
like shit.

1502
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:01,916
Electric fence.
You all right?

1503
01:32:01,982 --> 01:32:03,452
You all right?

1504
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:05,787
Goddamn.

1505
01:32:16,631 --> 01:32:18,200
You let me lead.

1506
01:32:34,050 --> 01:32:35,852
I don't want to quarrel
with you.

1507
01:32:35,918 --> 01:32:37,587
You're my little pony.

1508
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:42,925
I just want to climb
up on you one more time.

1509
01:32:55,506 --> 01:32:57,274
I can't believe
she'd live here.

1510
01:33:08,186 --> 01:33:09,521
Charlotte!

1511
01:33:39,052 --> 01:33:40,520
Charlotte?

1512
01:33:48,495 --> 01:33:49,729
Charlotte!

1513
01:33:57,237 --> 01:33:58,673
What you want?

1514
01:34:06,647 --> 01:34:08,116
She not here.

1515
01:34:08,216 --> 01:34:10,184
She gone.

1516
01:34:10,284 --> 01:34:12,587
What is it you want
with my wife?

1517
01:34:16,991 --> 01:34:18,260
Huh?

1518
01:34:20,329 --> 01:34:22,230
What is it you want
with my wife?

1519
01:34:25,067 --> 01:34:27,102
Just wanted
to say hello.

1520
01:34:27,169 --> 01:34:30,873
A quick hello and a quick poke
while you're at it?

1521
01:34:30,939 --> 01:34:32,909
How about you?
What you up to, Ward?

1522
01:34:35,611 --> 01:34:37,346
I know what you came for.

1523
01:34:40,416 --> 01:34:42,618
I got what you want.

1524
01:34:42,685 --> 01:34:44,621
Where is she?

1525
01:34:44,687 --> 01:34:47,023
How should I know?
I'm not leaving until I see her.

1526
01:34:47,090 --> 01:34:48,558
She not here.
She gone.

1527
01:34:49,726 --> 01:34:50,894
Let's go.
Where?

1528
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:52,128
How should I know?

1529
01:34:52,195 --> 01:34:53,697
Last night
she told me

1530
01:34:53,798 --> 01:34:55,398
she was going
to your father's wedding!

1531
01:34:55,465 --> 01:34:57,300
You're a liar!
We just come from there!

1532
01:34:57,367 --> 01:34:59,470
And that's where you
should go back to, boy!

1533
01:34:59,537 --> 01:35:00,971
He's lying!

1534
01:35:01,038 --> 01:35:02,472
He's lying.

1535
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:04,542
I got this.
Go back to the boat.

1536
01:35:04,642 --> 01:35:06,977
Where is she?
Where is she?

1537
01:35:07,044 --> 01:35:08,512
Stop provoking me, boy,

1538
01:35:08,612 --> 01:35:10,114
and do what your brother
tells you!

1539
01:35:10,214 --> 01:35:11,715
I said I'm not leaving
until I see her!

1540
01:35:14,386 --> 01:35:16,754
Goddamn it,
he killed her.

1541
01:35:16,821 --> 01:35:18,590
He killed her, Ward.

1542
01:35:18,657 --> 01:35:20,759
You killed her!

1543
01:35:20,826 --> 01:35:23,261
You son of a bitch!

1544
01:35:23,328 --> 01:35:25,163
That's all you were good
for is killing her!

1545
01:35:25,230 --> 01:35:26,698
Huh?

1546
01:35:26,798 --> 01:35:27,834
Run, Jack!

1547
01:35:30,569 --> 01:35:32,839
Come on, boy.
Show me.

1548
01:35:32,905 --> 01:35:34,373
I'm gonna fuck you up.

1549
01:35:34,474 --> 01:35:35,941
Come on!

1550
01:35:36,007 --> 01:35:37,343
Jack!

1551
01:35:37,410 --> 01:35:38,845
Ward!

1552
01:35:38,911 --> 01:35:40,680
Ward!

1553
01:35:40,746 --> 01:35:41,980
Is this
what you wanted?

1554
01:35:45,618 --> 01:35:46,853
Yeah.

1555
01:35:52,759 --> 01:35:54,428
You got
what you come for.

1556
01:35:55,928 --> 01:35:58,132
Paperboy.

1557
01:35:58,198 --> 01:36:00,000
Where you going,
paperboy?

1558
01:36:01,835 --> 01:36:03,804
Ain't no way
out of this one.

1559
01:36:09,543 --> 01:36:10,878
Fuck you!

1560
01:40:34,655 --> 01:40:36,925
Hillary Van Wetter
