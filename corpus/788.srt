1
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,578
We gotta jack it up. We need help here.

2
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:56,415
Hey, we got a flat tire in the back now.
They gotta get that unloaded.

3
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:59,683
Slim, get over there.
I don't need you working on the tarp.

4
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:03,488
I got it, I got it! Pull it down.
Hook it at the bottom.

5
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:05,995
Just get out of the way. Come on.

6
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:11,069
Hey, guys, get out of the truck.
We need a hand out here. Hurry up.

7
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:14,103
Come on, they got a flat tire down there.

8
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:19,306
Let's go, let's go. We gotta get down there.
The animals are getting spooked.

9
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,840
Hurry up. Hurry, now.
We've gotta get it unloaded.

10
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,382
Don't worry about it. Just let it go.

11
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:29,553
No, no. No, five of them. Go.
Don't worry about that.

12
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,991
Don't let the zebras run. Stay with them.

13
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,887
- Both of you, come here.
- Everything's off.

14
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:42,501
- No, no, no.
- All right, it's good. It's good.

15
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,327
We'll load them up
as soon as the tire's on.

16
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,973
Load them back on!
Don't forget anything!

17
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,735
- Come on. There you go.
- Go. Go.

18
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,174
- Let's go.
- We've got it.

19
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:55,940
- We got everything?
- We've got it all.

20
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:13,221
What the...? Hey. Hey, there.

21
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,400
Hey, boy, just calm down.
It's all right. It's all right.

22
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:32,335
There we go. There you go.

23
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,175
It's all right.

24
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,877
It's all right. There you go.

25
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,416
- All right.
- You weren't kidding.

26
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:25,021
Can we keep him, Daddy?
Can we, please?

27
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,764
I don't know, it's...

28
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:33,099
You know, he's probably got all kinds
of special needs. We should...

29
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,174
- We should probably call the zoo and...
- No.

30
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:39,709
No zoos. You know I don't like the idea
of animals in cages.

31
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,848
Honey, neither do I,
but let's just see what we got here.

32
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:45,416
Let's... I gotta think about this.

33
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:54,119
Well, first things first. Let's get him
some blankets and warm milk.

34
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:57,658
Okay, don't get too carried away.

35
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,847
- Stop waking me up.
- What's in the basket?

36
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,579
Hey, Tucker. Did you see that?

37
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:25,622
You seen one funny-looking horse,
you seen them all.

38
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:29,250
Oh, come on.
Get out there and say hello.

39
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:32,990
- Wake me up when he leaves.
- You know what, I'll do it myself.

40
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,760
That's the weirdest-looking horse
I've ever seen.

41
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:39,837
Oh, he's cute. Tucker, come out here
and meet our guest.

42
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,305
I'm coming. I swear, Franny,
the funnier-looking the animal...

43
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:47,071
...the more you wanna keep it.
- Kept you, didn't I?

44
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,710
Well, subdivide me and Kentucky-fry me.

45
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:53,215
You know what, Tucker,
you cut those bangs...

46
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:57,186
...you and him could be cousins.
- Bad hair.

47
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:01,418
- Just thinking out loud. Thinking out loud.
- Question time.

48
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,619
- What exactly are you?
- Good question.

49
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:07,562
- I don't know.
- Okay, we can rule out genius.

50
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:10,996
Don't make me chew open a can
of pony whup.

51
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,331
Save the sweet talk for later.

52
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,669
Don't pay any attention to him.
Listen, he's all whinny and no bite.

53
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:21,439
I'm Franny, this is Reggie,
and Mr. Sensitive here is Tucker.

54
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:24,082
And that old goat there is an old goat.

55
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,241
It's the chief.

56
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,848
- You used to be so nice.
- Yeah, I know, but I got over it.

57
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:33,253
Why do you have to be
such a horse's...?

58
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:47,466
Well, let's just get you dried off first,
all right?

59
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:57,305
He's got real strong legs.

60
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,815
He's quite the little athlete.

61
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,686
Hey, buddy.

62
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:09,461
Why don't you grab the milk
and see if he'll come to you.

63
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:13,991
Come here, boy. Come on.

64
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:17,728
Come on. Come on. There you are.

65
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,199
Come on, boy.

66
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,036
Come on.

67
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:27,239
Attaboy.

68
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:31,312
- Welcome to your new home, Stripes.
- Stripes?

69
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,412
Well, "Spot" doesn't work, now, does it?

70
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,181
You like that name, don't you?

71
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,154
Stripes.

72
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,697
Well, I'll take that as a yes.

73
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,933
Good morning, Walsh Farm!

74
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,803
Well, I know it's not glamorous,
but it's a living.

75
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:02,277
Keeps my head on my shoulders, which
is more than I can say for my cousins.

76
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,482
Simmer down there, Lightning.

77
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,295
Hey, hey, slow down. Boy, oh, boy.

78
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:29,339
Kids these days, no control.
Now, back in my day...

79
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,036
Oh, here we go again with
the ancient-history lesson. Enough.

80
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,040
Now we're in for it.

81
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,954
<i>And the horses are entering
the starting gates.</i>

82
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,787
Oh, what is that?

83
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:51,486
That is the only reason
for a horse to live, kid.

84
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:52,926
It's called a racetrack.

85
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:56,432
Oh, there's more to life
than running around in a circle.

86
00:08:56,602 --> 00:09:00,470
Well, maybe to you. It's like this:
Humans race, horses race.

87
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,134
<i>There was even a Chicken Run, but there's
never been a goat race. Ever, ever, ever.</i>

88
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,710
Get the picture, Franny?

89
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,813
- Could I race?
- It's complicated.

90
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:11,347
It takes a lot of work
to become a racehorse.

91
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:14,680
- What's a racehorse?
- They're the greatest.

92
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:17,948
Once a year, there's a big race
to see who's the best.

93
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:21,719
By the way, the horses that won every year
were the ones we trained.

94
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:25,227
- Why did you quit?
- Lxnay on the other-may.

95
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,731
Say what you mean.
We haven't spoken Latin since the pigs left.

96
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,129
Oh, all right.

97
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,136
A few years ago, the girl's mother
had an accident.

98
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:36,639
Yeah. Her horse stumbled
and neither one of them could be saved.

99
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:40,404
- The chief couldn't bear to train after that.
- And neither did we.

100
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,310
Hey, look, they're ready to go.

101
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,851
- How come none of them have stripes?
- You take this one.

102
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,418
Thanks.

103
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,522
Just unlucky, I guess.

104
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,720
<i>And they're off. Flash of Thunder's...</i>

105
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:59,228
Look at them. Look at them run.
Watch me, I'm a racehorse.

106
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:04,097
Well, would you look at him?
He loves to run. It's in his heart.

107
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,670
- But that's not enough.
- You could train him.

108
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,603
- Then it would be enough.
- Let me tell you something.

109
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:14,235
The legs are too short, the head's too big.
He's got as much chance to race as me.

110
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:18,281
Besides, I have got better things to do.

111
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,579
- Oh, go fix your hair.
- I heard that.

112
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:24,120
Watch me, I'm in the big race.

113
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,818
Excuse me. Racehorse coming through.

114
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:36,961
Whoa, look at that.

115
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,628
- Come on.
- Dude, I'm right with you.

116
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:47,167
Whoa, nice mohawk.

117
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,940
That's funny. Mohawk.

118
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,846
- What's a mohawk?
- Shut up, you idiot.

119
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:56,318
- You guys train to race?
- Yeah, you want a taste?

120
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:00,084
- Ready, set, go. Catch me if you can.
- Hey, I wasn't ready.

121
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:03,387
Come on, you slowpoke! Yeah!

122
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:14,204
- I'm not even in second gear yet.
- Yeah, he's not even in second gear yet.

123
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,005
Last one to the fence is a donkey.

124
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,842
- Dude, it's your dad.
- Great.

125
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,153
Son. Stay away from that fence.

126
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,618
Come on, Dad.
We were just having some fun.

127
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,018
Fun is overrated.

128
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:36,150
If you're going to be a champion,
I suggest you start acting like one.

129
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,695
- Oh, your dad scares me, dude.
- Not me.

130
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,561
- Pride! Ruffshodd!
- Coming, Father.

131
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,704
Yeah, coming, Mr. Sir Trenton, sir.

132
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,709
I don't understand.
Why won't he let them play with me?

133
00:11:53,879 --> 00:12:00,045
You're just different.
And for some horses, different is scary.

134
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:24,866
Come on, he's never late.

135
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,737
I'm all ready to go. Where is he?

136
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:31,775
Oh, here he comes.

137
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:38,054
Bring it on. Show me what you got.

138
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,191
Here we go.

139
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:51,286
Better luck tomorrow!

140
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,789
Dang! I had him today.

141
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:04,742
- She's just not right today, Mr. Cooper.
- Yep.

142
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,674
- Better give her a break.
- Okay.

143
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,944
You call that jumping?
Looked like she was having a seizure.

144
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:15,484
Sorry, Miss Dalrymple.
She seemed a bit shy on the high jump...

145
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:18,748
...so I thought I'd take it easy.
- Of course you did.

146
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:22,917
But, you know, the thing is,
I don't pay you to take it easy.

147
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:25,120
I pay you to train.

148
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,663
You can only push a horse so hard.

149
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:33,203
Cooper, cooper, cooper.
Why must you be so tedious?

150
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,564
Okay, here's the deal.

151
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:41,975
Now, as long as I am signing your checks,
you will push her as hard as I tell you to.

152
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:45,378
Don't you have a board meeting
at the track to get to?

153
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,249
As a matter of fact, I do.

154
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:55,152
Yo, yo, Pride. Check out the new filly.
What a mane.

155
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,658
Look at those flanks.

156
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:00,731
Watch. She's gonna come straight for me.
Do I have anything in my teeth?

157
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,562
You always have something
in your teeth, Ruffshodd.

158
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,402
- Hey, where's she going?
- Excuse me.

159
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:10,970
- Would you care to join me for a drink?
- A drink. Good call.

160
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,312
No.

161
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,604
Talk to the tail, boys.

162
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:21,646
Did you ever consider going around
that tree instead of through it?

163
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,415
Yeah, well, usually it moves
out of my way.

164
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,151
I've never heard of a tree doing that.

165
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,591
You don't know the trees here.
Are you new?

166
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:33,961
- Just got here. I'm Sandy.
- I'm Stripes.

167
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,294
You don't say?

168
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:40,370
- Are you a racehorse?
- No, I'm a jumper.

169
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,803
I've actually competed
all around the world.

170
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:46,240
Well, I'm a racehorse.
I'm training to be in the big race.

171
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,306
By racing the mailman?

172
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,744
Well, the other horses
don't wanna race me.

173
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,578
- I'm just way too fast for them.
- He's not a racer.

174
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,049
Oh, not them again.

175
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,748
They say his dad's a horse
and his mom's a fence.

176
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,389
Real funny, guys.

177
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:06,497
I've gotta go, I'm sorry.
I'll see you around, Stripes?

178
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,498
- Later.
- So, Stripey, how's it going?

179
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:13,126
- You still racing the mailman?
- Oh, the mailman wasn't racing him.

180
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:18,174
- He was running away from him.
- I'll race you any time you want.

181
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:23,646
- Well, unfortunately I don't race nobodies.
- Yeah, he don't race nobodies.

182
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:28,617
- Figures. All talk and no action.
- Well, this is disappointing.

183
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:31,187
- Oh, it's my dad.
- Listen, you.

184
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:35,191
I want you to stop bothering my son.
And you can tell Tucker I said that.

185
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:39,491
Trenton's Pride is a champion
with a real future. And you, well...

186
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,326
You have your place.

187
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,900
- Father, I...
- You and I will talk later.

188
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:48,062
Mr. Sir Trenton, sir, we been trying
to get this guy to stop bothering us...

189
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,606
...but he just won't stop...
- Ruffshodd.

190
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,677
...bothering us.
- Shut up, you idiot.

191
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,440
Yes, Mr. Sir Trenton, sir.

192
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,846
And may I say,
your coat is very shiny today.

193
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,853
There's a place where we can settle this.
No humans. No rules.

194
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,821
Where and when?

195
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:20,567
- Welcome to the Blue Moon Races.
- Yeah!

196
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,400
- It's him.
- Be quiet. Be quiet.

197
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:27,739
Tonight's first contestant
is 10-0 and good to go.

198
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:31,849
He is the baddest pony on the prairie.

199
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:37,455
Give it up for Trenton's Pride.

200
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,189
Step right up, if you're horse enough.

201
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:48,025
- Not me, no way.
- Who's feeling their oats?

202
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,828
- Nobody can beat him.
- No way. He's too tough.

203
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,062
I'll take him on.

204
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,446
Laugh it up. Just wait and see.

205
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,220
- Hey, Sandy.
- Hi, Stripes.

206
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,990
Well, well.
I'm surprised you showed up.

207
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:19,323
You wanna talk or race?

208
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:23,434
- That coat is simply dreadful.
- Well, it's slimming, though. Right?

209
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:27,663
- Oh, you're gonna wish you stayed home.
- You're gonna wish I stayed home too.

210
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,138
After I kick your butt.

211
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,708
And now, let's get ready to...

212
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:39,476
...race!

213
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:51,587
Up to that heap, around it
and back to here.

214
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:58,602
I am going to make you look so bad
in front of your girlfriend.

215
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,832
- Send him home, Pride.
- Show him who's boss.

216
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,101
You got guts, kid.

217
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,040
Come on, Pride.
You show him who's in charge.

218
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,008
Let's go!

219
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:13,674
Come on, Stripey, try and keep up.
See you, loser.

220
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:17,622
Just giving you a head start.
You're gonna need it.

221
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,348
Come on, Pride, is that all you got?

222
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,687
I'm not even breaking a sweat yet.

223
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,591
Good thing your daddy's not here
to see this.

224
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:28,164
Holy cow, what a kick.

225
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:33,161
- At least you're gonna keep this interesting.
- I told you guys he's fast.

226
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:42,108
Slow down, kid,
you're gonna blow the turn.

227
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,113
Stripes!

228
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:52,990
Nice turn, Stripey.
I tried to warn you.

229
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,690
How's that ridge taste?

230
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,862
What can you say? Rookie mistake.

231
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,135
- Stripes, are you all right?
- Go back where you belong!

232
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:15,212
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- What a loser!

233
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,211
Get out of here!

234
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,143
- Stripes.
- We don't want you.

235
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,913
- Go home!
- Hey, Stripey.

236
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:29,356
Did you really think that you could beat
a trained professional?

237
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,387
Hey there, boy.

238
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:01,092
What's up? What's the matter?

239
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,058
Feel like there's something
you're not telling me.

240
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:06,459
What, you sick or something?

241
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:11,366
There you are.
Now you're all gorgeous again.

242
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:15,438
I can't have my best boy
looking all gnarly, now, can I?

243
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,838
Stay out of the mud.

244
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,446
So you don't know
where the mud came from?

245
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:27,677
- It didn't come from the Blue Moon Races?
- Nope, just took a mudbath for my arthritis.

246
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,047
Chan!

247
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,953
Helmet.

248
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:42,725
- Take it easy.
- I'm gonna be late for work.

249
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:44,960
Yeah, that's right.

250
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:59,146
Boy, will you get a load of this dump?

251
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,810
Even Old MacDonald wouldn't want
this farm, but it's perfect.

252
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:07,288
Miles from the Jersey shore,
not an ocean in sight, not even a birdbath.

253
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:10,826
No one will look for a classy guy
like the Goose here.

254
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,301
Watch where you're going,
that's my knee.

255
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,429
So that's how we land
in the big city.

256
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:22,471
If there's no parking space,
you make one.

257
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,871
Any of you mugs got a problem
with that?

258
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:27,204
Nice landing.
Can we see you take off now?

259
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,711
Are you a small horse
or some sort of an ass?

260
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:33,214
- Because you look like an ass to me.
- I don't mean to be rude...

261
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:37,048
...but you seem to be more surf than turf.
Did you take a wrong turn?

262
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:40,589
Because you look slow, I'll skip the salad
and get to the risotto.

263
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:44,058
Let's just say I'm having
a little disagreement with my family.

264
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:47,926
We disagree on whether or not
they should whack me. Name's Goose.

265
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,728
Oh, a pelican named Goose.
Well, my name's Duck.

266
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:52,870
- Duck? Duck?
- Duck. Goose.

267
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:54,431
Oh, you're funny.

268
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:58,542
But there's only room for one wise guy
on this farm, and you should know...

269
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,737
...Goose is a name that strikes fear
into anyone on the East Coast.

270
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,277
Don't shoot! I didn't do it!

271
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,544
It was the horse with the funny hair.
The goat's in on it.

272
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,416
You're fine unless you're being chased
by a tractor.

273
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,649
Look, here's the whole spaghetti sauce.

274
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:17,352
I'm a hit bird, and when Sammy the Gull
needs a lesson taught...

275
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,258
...the Goose is the guy he calls.

276
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:22,400
Only this last job, I had a little mishap.

277
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:27,766
Instead of hitting Freddy the Flamingo,
I hit Sammy's Capo, Johnny Storkanado.

278
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:30,931
And now Sammy, Freddy, Johnny,
they're all after me.

279
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:34,806
- Hey, ever try shutting up?
- Ever try swimming in cement horseshoes?

280
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,609
- I've taken out punks bigger than you.
- What, you talk them to death?

281
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:42,982
Careful, pony boy, or somebody's gonna
wake up with your head in their bed.

282
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:45,487
Knew from that pecker
you'd be a bigmouth.

283
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:46,919
Watch it, stumpy.

284
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:51,153
I'd cut you off at the knees, but it looks
like somebody's beaten me to it.

285
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:54,560
All right, knock it off.
Nobody has anything to prove here.

286
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:56,963
Proof? You want proof, huh?

287
00:23:57,135 --> 00:24:00,332
You see Rusty the Rotating Rooster
up there?

288
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:04,942
- He's about to get Goosed.
- Where is hunting season when you need it?

289
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:09,843
Okay, adjust for the wind.
Nice, level flight.

290
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:13,240
Come on, Goose, use the Force.

291
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,991
Well, you can't say that he couldn't
hit the broadside of a barn door.

292
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:30,624
Acid rain! Acid rain! I'm blind.
It's too late for me.

293
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:36,138
Save yourselves. I'm going to the light.
I see a bucket of dead relatives!

294
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:40,836
Extra crispy. Extra crispy!

295
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,316
That's the worst turn
I've ever seen anybody make.

296
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:56,120
- Awful, terrible, stink-o.
- I have no idea what you're talking about.

297
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:59,457
The Blue Moon Races
are the worst-kept secret of all time.

298
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:02,191
I know. I almost had him.

299
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,733
- I should have beaten him, easily.
- Wrong.

300
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:07,394
You need more than raw talent,
which you have...

301
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:10,268
...to beat a well-trained racehorse.
It takes skill.

302
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:13,969
Real skill and real discipline
to become a racer. It's hard work.

303
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:16,136
Nothing good ever comes easy.

304
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,584
And speaking of hard work...

305
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:23,517
Oh, boy. See you later, kid.
Good luck.

306
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,923
Tractor's down, Stripes.

307
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:31,790
Yeah, it's time to earn your keep.

308
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,522
Yeah.

309
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,699
There you go. Easy, take it easy.

310
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:40,230
Yeah, good boy.

311
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,803
There you go.

312
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:48,443
Come on, now. Come on, Stripes,
just give it a little more.

313
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:51,741
Little more.
It's gonna be over that much quicker.

314
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,248
Come on, now.

315
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:55,682
Come on. Come on.

316
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:59,384
Hey, sweetness.
Look at your bigtime racehorse now.

317
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:02,185
Yeah, bigtime.

318
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,657
Check it out.

319
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:07,525
Hey, plow boy, you missed a spot!

320
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,366
Why don't you guys
go choke on an apple.

321
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:16,132
Come on, darling, don't go getting
your tail in a knot.

322
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:36,756
Talk to me. You look frustrated,
what's the matter?

323
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:41,395
What is it gonna take for me to get
to the track so I can have another shot?

324
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:45,400
I won't blow sun up your tail.
You're from the wrong side of the fence.

325
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,504
The only chance you've got is...

326
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:51,438
- Forget it, forget it, forget it.
- No. What? What were you gonna say?

327
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,602
You gotta get someone to ride you
so you can show them.

328
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,576
- A human?
- No, we're gonna strap...

329
00:26:56,748 --> 00:27:01,651
...Reggie to your back. Of course a human.
So if you do get to race, you'll be ready.

330
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,688
And pulling that thing can only help.
Put your back into it. Get to work.

331
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:08,621
Yeah. I will make it to the track, Tucker.

332
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:12,786
And when I do, I'm gonna beat Pride
and win the big race.

333
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:19,361
- Whoa, big fella!
- That's the attitude.

334
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:23,600
Well, like my mama used to say:

335
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:28,576
"You can put your boots in the oven,
but that won't make them biscuits."

336
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,203
Good boy.

337
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:57,572
Good boy.

338
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,774
You did all right, huh.

339
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:02,708
Yeah.

340
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,718
Good boy.

341
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,297
Hey, there's my best boy.

342
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:30,430
Been working you hard, hasn't he?

343
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,701
I'll see you later.

344
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:39,341
All right.
I need to find a way to get rid of you.

345
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:41,178
That could be arranged.

346
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:44,450
- Who are you?
- Name's Goose.

347
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:48,080
Always looking to do a favor
for someone that's been in the joint.

348
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,056
- When'd you get out?
- Out of where?

349
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,992
The pokey, the do-right ranch,
the iron-bar inn.

350
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:56,895
- Come on, you can level with me.
- What are you talking about?

351
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,901
Oh, you're good.
Yes, you are, you are very good.

352
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:04,906
So where did you do your stretch?
Sing Sing? Alcatraz? The Bronx Zoo?

353
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,771
Look, how can you help?

354
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,115
All right, listen up,
you glue-factory rejects.

355
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:14,945
Professor Goose is gonna school youse
in how to take out a motorcycle.

356
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,317
- Class is now in session.
- Will we be tested on this?

357
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,290
Stuff it, McNugget. Rule number one,
we never say nothing.

358
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,224
Even when tortured,
not a word gets out.

359
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:28,593
Watch this. Look out!
Freddy the Flamingo's right behind you.

360
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,167
- Hey, Goose.
- All right, I'll talk, I'll talk.

361
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:34,794
It was vito. Vito Pelligrino from Pier 9.

362
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:39,069
What do you know? Goose, who was really
a pelican, is really a stool pigeon...

363
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:41,610
...who is actually a chicken that ducks.

364
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,113
- That makes five birds in one, count them.
- I'm no chicken.

365
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,444
Mind you, I got nothing
against chickens.

366
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:52,352
I mean, some of my best friends
are chickens. Fowl are fine folks.

367
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:54,719
All right, let's go, it's time.

368
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:57,794
Now, you guys stay here.
This ain't gonna be pretty.

369
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,226
Oh, boy, now what do I do?

370
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:04,198
All right, tough guy, we can do this
the easy way or the hard way.

371
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:08,096
Gentlemen, don't let the feathers fool you,
this dude's dangerous.

372
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:10,935
He's a killing machine
disguised as an idiot.

373
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:14,010
Hey, you like that? Huh?
Right in the seat.

374
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,443
Okay, lights out.

375
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:19,048
Turning up the pain. You like that?

376
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:20,980
Come on, can you hear me?

377
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,748
Oh, a spitter, huh?
Oh, you wanna dance?

378
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,619
You want a piece of the Goose?

379
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:33,730
Karate-chop-a! Poke-a-sock-a!
Smack-a-face-a! Break-a-bones-a!

380
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:47,307
You see?
You call the Goose, and ba-da-bing.

381
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:49,679
Ba-da-boom.

382
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:55,383
This is Reggie Redrooster
with the farm report.

383
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:59,887
In sports news, Goose the Pelican
dropped the motorcycle in the first round.

384
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:04,256
Then, for good measure,
taught the truck a lesson as well.

385
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:09,228
Move it along, nothing to see here.

386
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,669
I'm gonna be late for work.

387
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:16,068
Well, you can take Old Blue.

388
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:22,774
Oh, that's just great.

389
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:24,471
Oh, come on.

390
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:27,117
How long will it take
to put on the spare?

391
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:30,413
Honey, that is the spare.

392
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:32,249
What the...?

393
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:40,024
Can I take Stripes?

394
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:44,023
- What do you mean, ride him?
- Just for today.

395
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:46,832
No. No.

396
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:50,236
Come on, I have to get to work.
Can I take him, please?

397
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,636
Honey, no.

398
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:54,607
Besides, I'd never be able
to get a saddle on him.

399
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:03,746
All right, so I got a saddle on him,
big deal.

400
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,482
Not like he's gonna let you ride him.

401
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:10,253
- You don't know him like I do.
- Well...

402
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:13,459
...even if he does let you,
you know how I feel.

403
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,360
I've been riding since I was 5.

404
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:19,534
- That's not the point.
- Come on.

405
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:22,798
I mean, it's almost like he wants
to be ridden.

406
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:25,602
Oh, honey. Honey, come on.

407
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:28,777
Just let me try.

408
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,846
Come on, come on.

409
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:38,153
Careful.

410
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,728
- Now we're talking.
- Talking to who?

411
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,996
What you been talking about?
You been training Stripes, haven't you?

412
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,999
Just nice and easy.

413
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:19,426
Run like the wind.
Show them what you got.

414
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:20,928
Will you shut up?

415
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:24,660
I'm the coach, you're the goat.
Now, listen to the way it's done.

416
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:27,303
Run like the wind, kid!
Show them what you got!

417
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:29,133
See, that's coaching.

418
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:33,142
Come on, Stripes. Come on.

419
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:39,913
Come on, boy!

420
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:56,425
Good boy.

421
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:08,078
Better get going back!
Circus must be in town!

422
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,905
I used to see spots,
now I'm seeing stripes.

423
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:13,944
Where'd that come from?

424
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:16,951
Shouldn't you be
on a carousel somewhere?

425
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:22,457
- This ain't the zoo!
- Oh, no way.

426
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,194
- Go home!
- Go home, four left hooves!

427
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:27,456
- Haven't you learned?
- You don't fit in!

428
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:29,862
- Hoof it!
- We don't want you!

429
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:33,094
- Nobody asked you here, freak!
- Yeah, no freaks allowed.

430
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,212
I'll see you later, buddy. Be good.

431
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,617
Those guys aren't so fast.
I can take them.

432
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:14,478
Scuzz, how can you ruin
a great song like that?

433
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:17,136
Oh, come on, man!
That song's already ruined.

434
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:19,783
You need some good tunes like this:

435
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:31,053
- Those aren't even the words.
- The words don't matter, man!

436
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:34,096
You know "you can't touch this,"
the rest of it's gold.

437
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:37,701
Okay, smart boy,
just go fly yourself into a fan.

438
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,997
Now, come on, let's go get some food.
Just follow me.

439
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:43,800
Waiter! Table for one, please.

440
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,307
Hey, why don't you take a closer look.

441
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:48,772
I'll tell Mom!

442
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:54,509
Scuzz, I don't believe it.
I got 20 million brothers and sisters...

443
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:57,415
...and Mom tells me
that I gotta look out for you.

444
00:35:57,588 --> 00:36:03,083
Well, that's because it's easy, dumb-dumb.
Nothing bad ever happens to me!

445
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:08,930
Scuzz, you know what?
Bad is the only thing that happens to you!

446
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,567
- Hey, pull my wing.
- No.

447
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:14,262
It's not like before.
I promise, nothing will happen.

448
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,641
Never, never fall for that. It's too easy!

449
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,883
Who does that thing belong to?

450
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:39,492
He's mine, Miss Dalrymple.
I had no other way of getting here.

451
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:44,766
- I'll go put him in the stables.
- Yes, and from now on...

452
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:50,067
...you will leave him at that petting zoo you
and your father so laughably call a farm.

453
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:53,404
This is a racetrack, dear,
not the Serengeti.

454
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:02,378
You don't know the words
to that either.

455
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,487
I can make up a rap about anything.

456
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:12,057
Hey. Hey, what's that?

457
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,097
Well, that's obvious.
It's the racetrack referee.

458
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:19,794
Buzz, check this out.
Hey, pal, why the long face?

459
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,303
- Thank you!
- "Why the long face?"

460
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:26,739
- Still got it!
- What are you doing? Look.

461
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:30,540
You're a horse!
You all have long faces, get it?

462
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:33,275
- It's a joke!
- I've heard all the jokes.

463
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:36,318
The others have been making fun
of me since I was born.

464
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:39,354
- I know I'm different.
- You think you had it rough?

465
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:43,482
You try starting out life as a maggot.
Nobody wants to pet a little maggot.

466
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:46,357
- Nobody.
- Scuzz, Scuzz, Scuzz. Come on, now. Easy.

467
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:50,557
Seriously, what's with the stripes?
Are you making some kind of statement?

468
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,259
Yeah, you know, I saw you...

469
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,768
...and I was about to say
to my brother Buzz:

470
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,567
"I never seen a black horse
with white stripes."

471
00:37:57,742 --> 00:38:02,679
You dimwit! He is obviously
a white horse with black stripes!

472
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,337
Now, anybody could see that.

473
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,845
Guys, look out!

474
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:15,957
- Are we dead? Are we dead?
- Well, if we are...

475
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,118
...Buzz, we're in heaven!

476
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:28,505
Here comes your open winner, Miss D.

477
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:31,198
Yes, well, he better be, Mr. Cooper.

478
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:34,833
Anything less than a victory,
and you'll be back shoveling manure.

479
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,896
- See you, woodzie.
- Night, Ken.

480
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:10,740
What are you doing, boy?
We shouldn't be out here.

481
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:20,382
I know, boy.

482
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:22,890
I feel it too.

483
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,594
When I was little...

484
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:32,764
...my mama used to bring me out here
at around this time.

485
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:36,262
Put me on the saddle behind her...

486
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:39,238
...take me once around the track.

487
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,945
It was like magic.

488
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:53,113
Come on, boy! Come on!

489
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:56,953
Go! Let's go, boy!

490
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,268
Easy, boy. Come on.

491
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,804
Attaboy.

492
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:11,999
Easy does it.

493
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,203
Good boy.

494
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:19,142
Channing!

495
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:21,944
- Hold on a second.
- Woodzie.

496
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:26,823
- You're not gonna tell anyone, are you?
- Mum's the word.

497
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,615
Well, who's your friend?

498
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:31,659
- Some turn of foot.
- This is Stripes.

499
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:34,127
- He's quick, huh?
- I'll say.

500
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:37,028
Like to get a watch on him for real.

501
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:40,560
Dad doesn't want me to ride,
let alone race.

502
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:44,731
Well, that's a crime.
You move just like your mom.

503
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:48,773
God rest her soul.
And not even a proper saddle.

504
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:53,007
A trainer friend of mine's working
some horses in the time trial tomorrow.

505
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:56,153
Why don't you come out early
and join in.

506
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,348
Yeah, you think about it.

507
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,658
Hey.

508
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:14,100
Forget where the house is?

509
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:16,771
Miss Dalrymple made me stay late.

510
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:21,972
- I can't stand her.
- Don't give me excuses.

511
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:25,582
And don't take it out on her.
If anything, you should pity her.

512
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:29,150
She sees a horse, she doesn't see beauty.
She just sees business.

513
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,585
I don't see how you ever worked for her.
She's such a pain.

514
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:35,281
I let most of it go in one ear
and out the other.

515
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:39,088
It was worth it. I got a chance to work
with some mighty fine horses.

516
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:42,054
We could do it again, you know.

517
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:47,530
- Chan...
- Dad...

518
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:50,003
...everybody says you're still the best.

519
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,802
We just need a few horses
to get us started.

520
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:55,673
Then we could put old Dalrymple
out to pasture.

521
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,473
That's in the past, honey.

522
00:41:57,815 --> 00:42:00,875
I fixed the flat.
You can take Blue to work tomorrow.

523
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,377
But I wanna ride Stripes.

524
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,355
He was great, Dad.
You should've seen him!

525
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:13,556
That was a one-shot deal.

526
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:15,488
You know how I feel.

527
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:18,264
- What about how I feel?
- Discussion's over.

528
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:20,266
- But, Dad...
- I said no, Chan.

529
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:25,440
You are so busy trying to keep me
from hurting myself like Mom...

530
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:29,306
...that you won't give me a chance
to just try anything.

531
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:36,686
Well, just because you've given up
on your dreams doesn't mean that I have to.

532
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:49,526
He treats me like I'm still a little girl.

533
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,561
Well, I'm not.

534
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,598
I wanna race.

535
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,375
I'm gonna race...

536
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:05,372
...and no one can stop me.

537
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,649
Doesn't anybody have a clock?

538
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:08,238
Easy, girl.

539
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,915
Hey! It's woodzie.

540
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:24,526
No! Help me! I'm drowning!

541
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:27,687
Get out of there, Scuzz!
That's the man's expresso!

542
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:29,856
I know.

543
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:32,832
I'm expressing myself.

544
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:37,236
You are the reason
they invented fly swatters.

545
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:41,904
There are those that say Trenton's Pride
is the only real contender this year.

546
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,015
- How do you feel about that?
- Well, dear, how do you feel about that?

547
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:50,586
Miss Dalrymple, how does Trenton's Pride
compare with his legendary father?

548
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:54,246
Well, I like to believe that
I can see a good bet, and I...

549
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:57,826
what...? Where's...? What the...?

550
00:44:57,995 --> 00:45:01,192
Excuse me. Excuse me!

551
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,297
I can't believe we're being upstaged
by a zebra.

552
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:08,904
What is that dreadful child up to now?

553
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:11,268
How can they allow this to happen?

554
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,674
- Eat my dust, runt!
- Loser!

555
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,249
I'm gonna run you down!
Who do you think you are?

556
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:22,349
You don't belong here!

557
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:27,852
You don't know nothing about this!

558
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:31,185
You're a joke!

559
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:39,026
It's all right, boy. It's all right.

560
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:53,872
Let's go, boy! Whoa, whoa, Stripes.

561
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:02,390
Come on, come on, boy!
Come on, Stripes!

562
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,322
Come on!

563
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:06,656
Come on, boy! Come on!

564
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:08,593
Faster! Come on, buddy!

565
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:17,697
Attaboy!

566
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:19,937
Faster, Stripes, faster! Come on!

567
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:26,978
Who would have thought a zebra
could have such a kick?

568
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:47,126
He's on the rail and moving fast.

569
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:05,650
Chan!

570
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,958
- Oh, my.
- Come on, come on, let's go!

571
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:11,651
You better make sure you get this, Mike.

572
00:47:13,263 --> 00:47:14,730
Chan!

573
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:16,160
- Chan!
- Nothing's broken.

574
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,891
Honey, just look in my eyes.

575
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:19,558
- Dad, it's nothing.
- Listen.

576
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:23,467
- It's fine.
- This is what I told you was gonna happen.

577
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,041
- Your father's right.
- He just got spooked. It's not his fault.

578
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:29,736
- He just needs some more training.
- Yes, right.

579
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:34,714
I'm sure that more than half of the blame
sits squarely on the shoulders of his rider.

580
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:36,876
- You're such a...
- Chan. Chan, Chan!

581
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:40,046
Just go get Stripes
and meet me in the parking lot.

582
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,188
You so obsessed with winning
you'll pick on a girl?

583
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:49,725
Really, Nolan.
You expect me to dignify that?

584
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:54,731
I'm just a Kentucky gal who loves watching
Thoroughbreds race at the top of their game.

585
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:57,299
Of course you are.

586
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:01,334
I'll tell you what.

587
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:04,804
As chairman of the Turfway Board...

588
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:07,507
...I hereby extend an invitation
to Mr. Walsh...

589
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:11,586
...to enter his zebra in the Kentucky Open.

590
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:16,589
All it takes is an entrance fee.

591
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:23,424
How about that, Mr. Walsh?

592
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,932
- Mr. Walsh?
- Mr. Walsh?

593
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:28,833
Well, there goes the great Nolan Walsh,
everyone.

594
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:32,840
Corn farmer and zebra trainer.
And you can print that.

595
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:37,470
Hey, Clara, can they print that you
ain't won the Kentucky Open...

596
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:40,879
...since Nolan stopped training
your horses for you?

597
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:44,248
- What do you have to say about that?
- Mind your own business.

598
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:50,856
You there! See what happens
when you forget your place.

599
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:53,588
A racetrack is no place for a zebra.

600
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,062
- What did you just call me?
- A zebra!

601
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:57,461
Which is what you are.

602
00:48:57,634 --> 00:49:00,262
You didn't really think
you were a horse, did you?

603
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,997
But I am a horse. A racehorse.

604
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:04,606
You're nothing of the kind.

605
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,107
You're lunch for a lion,
and that's about it.

606
00:49:07,544 --> 00:49:11,947
One thing's for sure, kid.
You will never be a racehorse.

607
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:21,385
A zebra? I thought I was a racehorse.

608
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:23,788
Why didn't anyone tell me?

609
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:34,470
Well, I just can't believe
you deliberately disobeyed me.

610
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,705
- I can't believe you took her side.
- I didn't.

611
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:39,967
And don't change the subject.

612
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:43,669
- Mom would've let me ride.
- Don't bring your mother into this!

613
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:45,278
Just don't.

614
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:46,814
Why not?

615
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:51,182
At least she would've tried to understand.
It's more than I can say for you!

616
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:53,050
Don't get out of the truck!

617
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,057
Channing, get back in the truck.

618
00:49:56,426 --> 00:49:58,326
Don't do it.

619
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:43,831
Well, well, well.

620
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:46,999
Look what the cat drug in.

621
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:56,511
Don't shoot me, don't shoot me!

622
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:58,119
Jersey flashback.

623
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:05,485
Hey, we made it, man! Nice!
That sure beats flying.

624
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:07,390
We made it, but...

625
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:10,328
- Well, little Skeeter here didn't.
- Oh, no.

626
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,468
You know, that's why Mom always said:

627
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:15,969
- "Look both ways before crossing."
- "Look both ways before crossing."

628
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,974
Afternoon, Woodzie.

629
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:22,403
- What brings you out here?
- I got a hunch about your zebra.

630
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,311
Look at this.

631
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:27,882
I left it right where it was
this morning.

632
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:32,846
- Twenty-three seconds a quarter mile?
- He didn't finish...

633
00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:36,550
...but I got him between the quarter pole
and the half-mile pole.

634
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:38,318
Twenty-three flat.

635
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:40,530
Your zebra.

636
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:49,429
Look, that zebra really wants to race.
I can see it.

637
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:52,598
You just need to train him.

638
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:55,304
Where would I do that?

639
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:57,706
And even if I could, I mean...

640
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:00,145
...you got the $5000 entrance fee?
I don't.

641
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:03,513
I do. And I won most of it
betting on your horses.

642
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:08,957
I know a good bet when I see it,
and I can't bet him if he's not in the race.

643
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,992
Come on, Nolan.

644
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:16,262
No. That's final.

645
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:20,864
Too poor to paint,
too proud to whitewash.

646
00:52:21,037 --> 00:52:23,562
He's not gonna let Stripes race.
That's not cool.

647
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,765
Let's go talk to Tucker.

648
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:29,638
- Guess who.
- Hey, Buzz and Scuzz!

649
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,542
How you been, fellas?

650
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:34,741
- We miss you down at the track.
- Those were great years.

651
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:38,354
Yeah, yeah. Listen, listen.
We got some bad news for Stripes.

652
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:42,652
Let me guess. His parole officers caught up
with him. Don't let them take you.

653
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:44,653
Is he always like this?

654
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:47,353
- Worse. Much worse.
- Anyway, listen, kid.

655
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:51,797
- The chief isn't gonna let you race.
- But don't worry. We'll cheer you up.

656
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:53,526
Check this one out.

657
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:07,509
Get off me, you stupid flies! Get off!

658
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:10,585
Man, "Ebony and Ivory" didn't work.
That's a first.

659
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:12,813
- Told you we should've rapped.
- Stripes.

660
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,556
Walking away isn't gonna solve anything.

661
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,793
Who cares. Leave me alone!

662
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:21,863
- We've gotta get this kid into the race.
- The chief will never go for it.

663
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:24,826
Of course he will.
Just like somebody else I know.

664
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:26,992
He just needs a little push.

665
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:31,732
I'm going to bed.

666
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,177
Channing?

667
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:41,749
- Yeah?
- Why don't you come on out here.

668
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:45,050
Come on.

669
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:55,330
This is gonna be a hard one, honey.

670
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:59,265
Probably the only thing to do,
really the obvious thing...

671
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,833
...is to get rid of the problem.

672
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:03,867
What?

673
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:06,232
Dad.

674
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,240
No!

675
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:12,142
It's not Stripes' fault.
He's not the problem. It's my fault.

676
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:16,052
Dad, you can't just get rid of him.

677
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:20,019
I... I know him
better than anyone ever could.

678
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:23,219
I love him.

679
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:27,924
What do you think the alternative is?

680
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:31,796
I don't ride him.

681
00:54:39,976 --> 00:54:42,069
Ever, ever again.

682
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:45,339
That's right, honey.

683
00:55:29,975 --> 00:55:31,408
Franny?

684
00:55:34,012 --> 00:55:35,809
Hey.

685
00:55:42,721 --> 00:55:44,552
Hey.

686
00:57:00,632 --> 00:57:02,827
How did you know?

687
00:58:00,191 --> 00:58:03,592
If you build it, they will come.

688
00:58:03,795 --> 00:58:07,026
Well, it's showtime, kid.
You ready to start training?

689
00:58:08,166 --> 00:58:10,134
Why bother?

690
00:58:11,036 --> 00:58:14,233
I don't understand this.
Isn't this what he wanted?

691
00:58:14,406 --> 00:58:16,840
This is exactly why I never had kids.

692
00:58:17,008 --> 00:58:18,498
- Reggie?
- Yes?

693
00:58:18,677 --> 00:58:20,736
Get off my back.

694
00:58:33,024 --> 00:58:34,321
Hey, hotshot.

695
00:58:34,659 --> 00:58:38,356
- Run into any trees lately?
- Oh, great. More jokes.

696
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:41,727
- I really wanna be alone, Sandy.
- What's going on with you?

697
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:44,596
That doesn't sound like the attitude
of a racehorse.

698
00:58:44,769 --> 00:58:48,102
Because I'm not a racehorse.
I'm not even a regular horse.

699
00:58:48,273 --> 00:58:50,298
- I'm a...
- Zebra?

700
00:58:50,475 --> 00:58:53,444
I know. I've traveled
around the world, remember?

701
00:58:53,612 --> 00:58:55,136
Why didn't you say anything?

702
00:58:55,313 --> 00:58:58,305
Because I don't care
that you're not a racehorse.

703
00:58:58,483 --> 00:59:00,917
You love to run,
and that's all that matters.

704
00:59:01,086 --> 00:59:05,079
Maybe to you.
But it's not your problem, Sandy.

705
00:59:05,824 --> 00:59:09,851
You know, if you wanna see
the real problem, try looking down.

706
00:59:10,028 --> 00:59:11,655
Fine.

707
00:59:22,507 --> 00:59:24,839
After we're done with the gate...

708
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:27,444
...we need to think about
how he's gonna last.

709
00:59:27,612 --> 00:59:30,103
So we gotta work on stamina,
more than speed...

710
00:59:30,281 --> 00:59:32,340
...because zebras burn more adrenaline.

711
00:59:32,517 --> 00:59:35,281
They have a heightened flight reflex...

712
00:59:35,787 --> 00:59:38,722
...that comes from being hunted
on the plains of Africa.

713
00:59:39,658 --> 00:59:42,058
You're not the only one who uses
the Internet.

714
00:59:42,394 --> 00:59:45,420
- Impressive, Dad.
- Come on, let's get back to it.

715
00:59:45,597 --> 00:59:47,929
Let's give him one more shot at it.

716
00:59:48,133 --> 00:59:50,727
All right, bring him in. That's it, that's it.

717
00:59:51,269 --> 00:59:52,964
Careful, Chan. Careful.

718
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:59,370
It's all right. Stop. Walk him away.
Now, just walk him away from the gate.

719
00:59:59,711 --> 01:00:02,077
The gate's always trouble.
They should know.

720
01:00:02,247 --> 01:00:05,444
He needs a break. He needs a break.
So do I.

721
01:00:06,251 --> 01:00:10,654
- I don't know why he's acting like this.
- It's gonna take him some time, that's all.

722
01:00:10,822 --> 01:00:12,756
He'll be all right.

723
01:00:21,833 --> 01:00:26,133
- I better go talk to the kid.
- Take it easy on him.

724
01:00:28,773 --> 01:00:31,435
- Hey, what's your problem?
- I'm not a racehorse.

725
01:00:31,609 --> 01:00:33,668
- What?
- I don't belong in the gate!

726
01:00:33,845 --> 01:00:36,143
No, no, you're wrong.
And I'll tell you why.

727
01:00:36,314 --> 01:00:40,307
Racing is for anyone.
Anyone with a fire in their heart.

728
01:00:40,952 --> 01:00:44,581
What do you know, you little nobody?
You never raced.

729
01:00:49,094 --> 01:00:51,255
They're all the same.

730
01:00:52,063 --> 01:00:53,655
Tucker doesn't understand.

731
01:00:53,832 --> 01:00:58,132
He didn't even know that I was a zebra.
He doesn't get it. What's he ever done?

732
01:00:58,303 --> 01:01:01,670
Let me tell you something.
I've made a few clams on the ponies.

733
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:04,138
This guy's all hair and no brains.

734
01:01:04,309 --> 01:01:07,836
That's just about enough out of you,
young colt. And, Goose, bang!

735
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,341
Hit the hay!

736
01:01:10,815 --> 01:01:13,249
Come here.
People think they know everything.

737
01:01:13,418 --> 01:01:16,046
You tell somebody something,
they get an attitude.

738
01:01:16,221 --> 01:01:19,122
Hey, I didn't know the goat
was packing.

739
01:01:20,925 --> 01:01:23,894
Come up here.
I want you to take a look up there.

740
01:01:24,062 --> 01:01:26,394
- You tell me what you see.
- I've seen them.

741
01:01:26,731 --> 01:01:32,499
- The chief, my girl and her mother.
- And that's it? No. Look closer.

742
01:01:32,904 --> 01:01:34,872
- That's Sir Trenton.
- And who else?

743
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:37,166
- Tucker.
- That's right, Tucker.

744
01:01:37,342 --> 01:01:40,869
He trained Sir Trenton.
He and the chief trained all the winners.

745
01:01:41,045 --> 01:01:43,570
And not one of them ever,
ever thanked him.

746
01:01:44,349 --> 01:01:47,045
- How come he never said anything?
- Because to him...

747
01:01:47,218 --> 01:01:50,346
...actions speak louder than words.
He believes in you.

748
01:01:50,522 --> 01:01:53,320
And now you're gonna
have to believe in him too.

749
01:01:59,164 --> 01:02:03,624
I'm sorry for the way I've been acting. I'm
the last one who should be name-calling.

750
01:02:03,802 --> 01:02:07,033
Look at me. When you got shorter legs
than a sheepdog...

751
01:02:07,205 --> 01:02:10,174
...you get used to being made fun of.
I can relate.

752
01:02:10,341 --> 01:02:12,138
It's just...

753
01:02:12,310 --> 01:02:14,540
I'm not really a racehorse.

754
01:02:14,712 --> 01:02:16,612
I'm a...

755
01:02:16,881 --> 01:02:18,815
- I'm a zebra.
- So what?

756
01:02:18,983 --> 01:02:22,214
You're a horse with stripes
who needs an attitude adjustment.

757
01:02:22,587 --> 01:02:25,954
Tucker, you don't really think
I have what it takes, do you?

758
01:02:26,124 --> 01:02:28,024
Now listen to me, kid. You're right.

759
01:02:28,193 --> 01:02:31,685
You don't have the strength or ability
of a Thoroughbred...

760
01:02:31,863 --> 01:02:35,458
- I knew it.
...but you have got more heart...

761
01:02:35,633 --> 01:02:37,863
...than all of them put together.

762
01:02:38,436 --> 01:02:42,236
But the gate! I freeze up.
It keeps me from running.

763
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,499
I don't know what it is. I can't do it.

764
01:02:44,676 --> 01:02:47,144
Most horses are afraid of
the gate at first.

765
01:02:47,312 --> 01:02:50,440
It's perfectly normal.
But they get over it. You will too.

766
01:02:50,615 --> 01:02:54,312
You just keep running, okay?
And let the chief worry about the gate.

767
01:02:54,485 --> 01:02:56,578
He knows what he's doing.

768
01:03:08,633 --> 01:03:09,998
Attaboy!

769
01:03:15,673 --> 01:03:17,334
Yeah, boy!

770
01:03:34,125 --> 01:03:36,787
Did you see that? You see that?
Good job, Chan!

771
01:03:37,228 --> 01:03:39,856
There it is! That's what I'm talking about!

772
01:03:41,866 --> 01:03:44,130
Good job, Chan! Walk him out.

773
01:03:44,502 --> 01:03:46,299
We might actually have a chance.

774
01:03:46,471 --> 01:03:50,168
If we're lucky, maybe at 99-1.

775
01:03:50,341 --> 01:03:52,639
There's just one thing left to work on.

776
01:03:52,810 --> 01:03:55,210
- And that's the gate.
- No problem.

777
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:57,644
You've worked every kind
of horse there is.

778
01:03:57,815 --> 01:04:00,215
Yeah, well, the problem is,
he's not a horse.

779
01:04:00,385 --> 01:04:04,481
Relax, Nolan.
If anyone can do it, you can.

780
01:04:04,656 --> 01:04:06,681
I'm counting on it.

781
01:04:13,398 --> 01:04:15,366
It's gonna sound like a carnival.

782
01:04:15,633 --> 01:04:18,500
You won't know which way to look.
Look straight ahead.

783
01:04:18,770 --> 01:04:23,173
Just ignore all that noise, all that talk,
all that yelling, all that jiggling.

784
01:04:23,975 --> 01:04:25,670
Come on, now.

785
01:04:26,611 --> 01:04:28,909
You gotta let all this...

786
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:31,514
This out of your mind.

787
01:04:31,683 --> 01:04:34,243
All that's gotta fall away.

788
01:04:34,752 --> 01:04:36,720
That's right. That's right.

789
01:04:36,888 --> 01:04:39,823
Because I want your world
to be silent.

790
01:04:40,058 --> 01:04:44,256
I want you to hear nothing
but your own heartbeat.

791
01:04:46,531 --> 01:04:48,328
That's it.

792
01:04:50,568 --> 01:04:52,661
Easy does it. Come on, buddy.

793
01:04:52,837 --> 01:04:55,397
- That's a good boy.
- Good boy.

794
01:04:55,573 --> 01:04:57,973
- Good boy.
- That's it. You got the idea.

795
01:04:58,142 --> 01:05:00,007
- Come on, now.
- Good job, Stripes.

796
01:05:00,178 --> 01:05:04,080
Good boy. Chan, duck your head.
That's not so hard. Slow down.

797
01:05:04,248 --> 01:05:08,776
- Good boy. Easy does it.
- Good boy. Just like that. There you go.

798
01:05:11,856 --> 01:05:13,221
Good.

799
01:05:14,892 --> 01:05:16,291
That's right, good boy.

800
01:05:16,761 --> 01:05:19,025
Attaboy.

801
01:05:20,465 --> 01:05:21,762
Easy does it.

802
01:05:22,166 --> 01:05:24,361
Good boy.

803
01:05:28,339 --> 01:05:31,240
- You did it.
- Yeah, I guess I did, huh?

804
01:05:31,409 --> 01:05:33,070
Now what?

805
01:05:33,244 --> 01:05:35,371
Now you give it all you got.

806
01:05:41,319 --> 01:05:44,482
- Let's show them what we got!
- They cannot be serious.

807
01:05:44,822 --> 01:05:49,759
This will not stand. I will not allow
that beast to run in my competition.

808
01:05:49,927 --> 01:05:53,328
Please, Father, don't interfere.
I can win it, fair and square.

809
01:05:54,032 --> 01:05:56,830
That's not a risk I'm willing to take.

810
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:05,704
Double Pride's workout schedule.

811
01:06:27,165 --> 01:06:30,726
Pull! Pull! Come on, pull!

812
01:07:10,908 --> 01:07:14,105
Come on, Scuzz! What are you
doing here? Give it to me! Push!

813
01:07:14,278 --> 01:07:17,839
I can't do no more, take it!
Put the marshmallows back on!

814
01:07:18,015 --> 01:07:19,573
You ate the marshmallows!

815
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:22,981
Stretch him out! Lighten up on him!
Lighten up on him!

816
01:07:47,278 --> 01:07:49,337
Boy, are you in for a surprise.

817
01:07:51,015 --> 01:07:53,711
You'll never beat a Trenton.

818
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:10,127
- You weren't supposed to hear that.
- Oh, God, what is that?

819
01:08:10,301 --> 01:08:14,101
I got a million eyes,
and you got every one of them burning!

820
01:08:17,909 --> 01:08:21,037
- Well, tomorrow's the big day, kid.
- Do you think I'm ready?

821
01:08:21,212 --> 01:08:25,046
Absolutely. Listen, you can run,
there's no doubt about that.

822
01:08:25,216 --> 01:08:28,708
Your legs are gonna be burning
when you're turning for home.

823
01:08:28,886 --> 01:08:31,286
That's when you find out
what you're made of.

824
01:08:31,455 --> 01:08:36,051
You know what I used to tell my racers?
"Don't look back, leave it all on the track."

825
01:08:36,227 --> 01:08:40,960
- What does that mean?
- Kid, when the time is right, you'll know.

826
01:08:51,876 --> 01:08:53,468
Hello?

827
01:08:53,778 --> 01:08:57,805
Where you think you going?
You have a big day tomorrow. You can't go.

828
01:08:58,749 --> 01:09:01,411
I need to make things right with Sandy.

829
01:09:02,053 --> 01:09:04,851
All right. I understand.

830
01:09:05,022 --> 01:09:07,684
But listen, a little advice
from an old goat:

831
01:09:08,125 --> 01:09:13,620
Relationships are like racing. When you do it
for love, you've already won.

832
01:09:14,465 --> 01:09:16,262
Go on, go on.

833
01:09:25,376 --> 01:09:26,968
- Hey, Sandy.
- What?

834
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:31,371
I was hoping you'd come by.

835
01:09:34,252 --> 01:09:36,777
- I'm sorry that I was mean.
- I'm sorry that I...

836
01:09:37,188 --> 01:09:41,056
- You go first.
- The things I said the other day?

837
01:09:41,225 --> 01:09:45,218
- I just wanna say I was wrong.
- Well, yeah.

838
01:09:46,297 --> 01:09:49,391
You just... You got me so mad
because you weren't seeing it!

839
01:09:49,567 --> 01:09:52,058
- Seeing what?
- How lucky you are.

840
01:09:52,236 --> 01:09:53,794
- Me, lucky?
- Yes.

841
01:09:53,971 --> 01:09:56,633
The grass is way greener on your side
of the fence.

842
01:09:56,807 --> 01:10:00,903
Look at the training facilities. You've got
everything a horse could dream of.

843
01:10:01,078 --> 01:10:03,308
Yeah, everything except real friends.

844
01:10:03,481 --> 01:10:07,542
Friends like you have.
And a friend like I bet you are.

845
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:14,815
Listen, Sandy, I know I don't look
like a racehorse, but...

846
01:10:15,226 --> 01:10:17,251
Stop! Stop.

847
01:10:17,728 --> 01:10:22,131
You know, I care more about what's on the
inside, and you have more on the inside...

848
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:26,794
...than any of the horses over there.
And I also happen to think...

849
01:10:26,971 --> 01:10:31,271
...that what you have on the outside
is the cutest thing on four hooves.

850
01:10:33,577 --> 01:10:38,241
And, just so you know,
I'm already on your side.

851
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:52,855
Well, well, well. What have we here?

852
01:10:53,631 --> 01:10:57,067
- Beauty and the beast.
- Oh, no. Sir Trenton.

853
01:10:57,234 --> 01:10:59,759
I'm afraid there's been
a change of plans, zebra.

854
01:10:59,937 --> 01:11:03,270
You're about to get scratched
from tomorrow's racecard.

855
01:11:03,441 --> 01:11:08,071
- Oh, no. There are so many.
- It's okay. Let's stay calm.

856
01:11:08,512 --> 01:11:13,006
- Pretty picture, huh, boys?
- Don't do this, Sir Trenton, please!

857
01:11:13,317 --> 01:11:15,911
- Take her away.
- All right, boss.

858
01:11:16,087 --> 01:11:17,213
- Let's go.
- Sandy!

859
01:11:17,388 --> 01:11:19,754
Stripes, I'm not going
anywhere without you!

860
01:11:19,924 --> 01:11:22,017
- It's all right, Sandy. Just go.
- Yeah!

861
01:11:22,193 --> 01:11:24,491
Better hide your eyes there, honey!

862
01:11:25,996 --> 01:11:28,794
We're out of here. Trust me,
you don't wanna see this.

863
01:11:28,966 --> 01:11:31,662
- You better not hurt her.
- Oh, don't fret about her.

864
01:11:31,836 --> 01:11:35,829
As long as you don't race tomorrow,
I wouldn't dream of harming her.

865
01:11:36,006 --> 01:11:38,998
You, on the other hand,
need to be taught a lesson.

866
01:11:39,176 --> 01:11:41,076
Show him!

867
01:11:58,763 --> 01:12:01,698
Oh, that's just great!
The race is in four hours.

868
01:12:01,866 --> 01:12:05,632
Well, he went out last night,
he said he was gonna go find Sandy and...

869
01:12:05,803 --> 01:12:08,567
And you, Miss Softy,
you just let him go, didn't you?

870
01:12:08,739 --> 01:12:11,708
- Goose, time to earn your keep.
- I'm on it!

871
01:12:17,748 --> 01:12:20,273
Where are you, kid? Where are you?

872
01:12:32,196 --> 01:12:34,027
Looks like the work of a pro.

873
01:12:34,198 --> 01:12:38,601
Hey, kid. Kid, come on, wake up!
How many wings am I holding up?

874
01:12:43,107 --> 01:12:46,008
- Is he okay?
- Goose, go get him some water.

875
01:12:51,382 --> 01:12:54,010
I knew I should've stayed with him
last night.

876
01:13:03,627 --> 01:13:06,994
They have Sandy.
Sir Trenton's gonna hurt her if I race.

877
01:13:07,164 --> 01:13:11,498
Those dirty rats. I say we get busy
and show those bums what for!

878
01:13:12,670 --> 01:13:16,162
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
No, you right. You are right.

879
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:20,367
Let us go and kick some horse flank.
Come on, y'all!

880
01:13:20,544 --> 01:13:22,876
Let's move in with the SWAT team!

881
01:13:24,882 --> 01:13:27,680
Quiet!

882
01:13:28,853 --> 01:13:33,950
Thank you. Now, listen. To rescue Sandy,
we all have to work together.

883
01:13:34,124 --> 01:13:37,890
Just when I think I'm out,
they pull me back in!

884
01:13:38,062 --> 01:13:42,021
Here's the plan. And I don't know why
I didn't think of this earlier.

885
01:13:42,199 --> 01:13:46,260
I could build a giant wooden chicken
and hide inside.

886
01:13:46,437 --> 01:13:51,739
Then, under cover of night,
I'll jump out and I'll...

887
01:13:55,379 --> 01:13:56,903
Or I could just stay home.

888
01:13:57,081 --> 01:14:00,881
Knock it off, Reggie. Now, listen up.
Here's what we're gonna do.

889
01:14:03,053 --> 01:14:05,283
Listen, boy. I won this race...

890
01:14:05,456 --> 01:14:09,586
...my daddy won it, his daddy won it,
all the way back to General Trenton...

891
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:13,821
...who won the first Kentucky Open
100 years ago. You get my point?

892
01:14:13,998 --> 01:14:16,990
- I'll do my best, Dad.
- Yeah, well, good.

893
01:14:22,673 --> 01:14:24,470
You won't get away with this.

894
01:14:24,642 --> 01:14:28,100
Hush, now, little girl.
You're interfering with my Mozart.

895
01:14:28,279 --> 01:14:30,338
I wonder if he was a Thoroughbred.

896
01:14:32,016 --> 01:14:34,246
- There's Sandy.
- And there's Sir Trenton...

897
01:14:34,418 --> 01:14:37,080
...all 1500 pounds of him.
We'll never get her out.

898
01:14:37,254 --> 01:14:39,620
Oh, yes, we will.
We just need a diversion.

899
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:42,224
I got your diversion right here.
Out of my way.

900
01:14:42,393 --> 01:14:43,826
Goose! Stick with the plan!

901
01:14:44,628 --> 01:14:46,425
Hey, moron! Up here!

902
01:14:46,864 --> 01:14:48,832
Never side against the family.

903
01:14:54,838 --> 01:14:57,136
Will you remind me again
why we brought him?

904
01:14:57,308 --> 01:15:00,744
- Hey, who killed the lights?
- How did you get in here?

905
01:15:00,911 --> 01:15:04,506
Say your prayers, pelican.
Your lights are about to go out for good.

906
01:15:04,682 --> 01:15:08,140
- Can I get a little help here?
- Oh, great. There goes plan A.

907
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:11,311
- Say hello...
- To plan B!

908
01:15:11,789 --> 01:15:14,815
Horse's booty at 12 o'clock.
Follow me, you're my wingman.

909
01:15:14,992 --> 01:15:18,484
No way! You follow me! You are
my wingman! I am not your wingman!

910
01:15:18,662 --> 01:15:20,687
You're my "pull my wing" man!

911
01:15:20,864 --> 01:15:23,492
Whoa, dude.
A little trim wouldn't kill you!

912
01:15:29,907 --> 01:15:31,374
What is that hideous racket?

913
01:15:31,542 --> 01:15:35,171
Get back here! Come on,
I'll fight you with one wing behind my back.

914
01:15:35,346 --> 01:15:37,405
Nobody is allowed in my stables!

915
01:15:38,215 --> 01:15:40,308
I'll shut you up for good!

916
01:15:40,818 --> 01:15:43,582
Scuzz! You always get us in trouble.

917
01:15:44,455 --> 01:15:47,424
Hey, Trenton! Walk this way.

918
01:15:47,591 --> 01:15:49,252
- Break it down!
- What in the...?

919
01:15:49,426 --> 01:15:52,020
- This just ain't my speed here.
- You can do it.

920
01:15:52,196 --> 01:15:55,996
- You're Superfly, son.
- All right, step back and watch me work.

921
01:15:58,535 --> 01:16:00,435
Turn this up, now!

922
01:16:00,604 --> 01:16:02,333
Say it like you mean it!

923
01:16:02,973 --> 01:16:04,497
Come on, now!

924
01:16:06,143 --> 01:16:08,043
What is going on here?

925
01:16:08,545 --> 01:16:11,173
- Tucker, get Sandy.
- You're the boss.

926
01:16:14,551 --> 01:16:16,041
What?

927
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:19,014
- Come on, Sandy.
- Tucker! You old rail rat!

928
01:16:19,189 --> 01:16:21,384
- I might've known!
- Let's go! Quick!

929
01:16:21,659 --> 01:16:25,789
You and your animal freak show
have gotten in my way for the last time!

930
01:16:25,963 --> 01:16:29,421
- Those legs won't carry you far, Tucker!
- Hey! Wait for us!

931
01:16:35,039 --> 01:16:36,506
Where are they?

932
01:16:37,141 --> 01:16:40,577
- Come on.
- Stripes! Over here!

933
01:16:40,811 --> 01:16:42,540
Sandy!

934
01:16:43,113 --> 01:16:44,410
Look out, he's coming!

935
01:16:54,324 --> 01:16:58,260
- I'm getting too old for this.
- You was born too old for this. Let's go!

936
01:17:00,731 --> 01:17:04,929
- You won't get away with this!
- Leave us alone, Sir Trenton.

937
01:17:05,102 --> 01:17:07,730
You and your foolish friends
accomplished nothing.

938
01:17:07,905 --> 01:17:10,999
The affections of a filly
do not make you a racehorse!

939
01:17:11,175 --> 01:17:14,611
You know something, Sir Trenton?
I don't want to be a racehorse.

940
01:17:14,778 --> 01:17:17,747
I'm a zebra.
And I'm going to the big race.

941
01:17:17,981 --> 01:17:20,575
- You fool.
- Come on, Tucker.

942
01:17:20,751 --> 01:17:23,948
- Let's go win ourselves a horserace.
- I like your attitude.

943
01:17:24,521 --> 01:17:27,888
You runts don't know
what you're in for.

944
01:17:28,525 --> 01:17:30,584
Well, he's nowhere south of the barn.

945
01:17:30,761 --> 01:17:33,457
He's not by the creek either.
What are we gonna do?

946
01:17:33,630 --> 01:17:36,827
We're gonna keep looking.
We'll start at the top of the hill.

947
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,991
Well, let's go! We got a race to run.

948
01:17:39,169 --> 01:17:41,660
Stripes is missing.
We don't know what happened.

949
01:17:41,839 --> 01:17:44,637
What are you talking about?
He looks okay to me.

950
01:17:47,311 --> 01:17:49,905
Chan, get him cleaned up
and loaded right now.

951
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,570
You got it, coach.

952
01:17:58,021 --> 01:18:01,320
- It's the filly.
- It always is.

953
01:18:01,725 --> 01:18:03,693
Hey! Hey, she's from Philly.

954
01:18:03,861 --> 01:18:07,695
I didn't know she was from Philly.
Man, I love those Philly cheesesteaks.

955
01:18:07,865 --> 01:18:12,302
Or any kind of cheese, really. Or any food
from anywhere. Especially candy and poop.

956
01:18:12,469 --> 01:18:15,131
- What were we talking about?
- I hate my life.

957
01:18:24,448 --> 01:18:26,939
Guys, I'm not gonna let Tucker
have all the fun.

958
01:18:27,117 --> 01:18:29,608
- There's no way I'm missing this.
- Hey, hold on!

959
01:18:29,953 --> 01:18:31,580
Wait for me!

960
01:18:33,390 --> 01:18:36,120
This chicken is flying the coop!

961
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:41,420
Finally, some peace and quiet.
Y'all go ahead. Bye-bye, now.

962
01:18:41,598 --> 01:18:44,795
I'll just stay here and watch the palace.
For shizzle.

963
01:18:56,180 --> 01:18:58,114
Hang on a second. I just...

964
01:18:59,516 --> 01:19:02,781
I think your mom would've wanted
you to have that.

965
01:19:11,528 --> 01:19:12,893
Dad...

966
01:19:14,298 --> 01:19:16,596
...I don't know what to say.

967
01:19:17,501 --> 01:19:20,061
Well, you were right.
You know, I've been...

968
01:19:20,904 --> 01:19:22,462
...scared since Mom died.

969
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:25,233
You know, too scared to train horses...

970
01:19:26,376 --> 01:19:28,640
...too scared to let you grow up.

971
01:19:29,713 --> 01:19:31,806
You forgive your old man?

972
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:35,115
Daddy, you're not old.

973
01:19:40,290 --> 01:19:43,817
- Maybe a little gray.
- All right, well, let's get a move on.

974
01:20:08,151 --> 01:20:10,278
Riders, up!

975
01:20:10,821 --> 01:20:12,982
There you go. Okay, come on.

976
01:20:13,857 --> 01:20:16,382
Stay away from the rail, now.
Don't get boxed in.

977
01:20:22,933 --> 01:20:25,959
Ladies and gentlemen,
would you all please stand...

978
01:20:26,136 --> 01:20:29,367
...and join in singing the national anthem.

979
01:20:47,057 --> 01:20:50,185
When you're in the gate,
don't listen to the other racers.

980
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:54,126
Let them do all the horsing around.
Save your energy for when it counts.

981
01:20:54,298 --> 01:20:57,927
Right. But, Tucker,
I do kind of feel sick to my stomach.

982
01:20:58,101 --> 01:21:00,365
Good. That means you're ready.

983
01:21:17,955 --> 01:21:20,651
This is Courtney Jones, KNN,
coming to you live...

984
01:21:20,824 --> 01:21:24,521
...from Turfway Park, where
horseracing history is about to be made.

985
01:21:24,695 --> 01:21:27,163
- Can a zebra...?
- Sentimental favorite, Stripes...

986
01:21:27,331 --> 01:21:28,889
...can beat Trenton's Pride.

987
01:21:29,766 --> 01:21:32,098
He is trained by the legendary
Nolan Walsh...

988
01:21:32,269 --> 01:21:35,238
...who came out of retirement
specifically for this race.

989
01:21:35,405 --> 01:21:39,205
Stripes is ridden by the remarkable
16-year-old jockey, Channing Walsh.

990
01:21:39,376 --> 01:21:42,937
What could go down as extraordinary
in the history of horseracing...

991
01:21:43,113 --> 01:21:45,445
...is taking place at Turfway Park.

992
01:21:45,615 --> 01:21:49,984
Only a few short weeks ago, no one
had ever heard of Stripes, the racing zebra.

993
01:22:05,102 --> 01:22:06,660
Nolan.

994
01:22:07,070 --> 01:22:08,401
Clara.

995
01:22:08,705 --> 01:22:10,229
Beautiful day, huh?

996
01:22:10,407 --> 01:22:13,808
It would be if you weren't working
so hard to ruin my race day...

997
01:22:13,977 --> 01:22:16,468
...with that glorified donkey of yours.

998
01:22:17,647 --> 01:22:20,138
You're chipper
for someone who's about to lose.

999
01:22:20,317 --> 01:22:22,945
You wanna make this more interesting?
I mean...

1000
01:22:23,587 --> 01:22:26,385
- I'm listening.
- All right. I'll make you a deal.

1001
01:22:26,556 --> 01:22:29,855
My zebra wins, I get your filly,
the white jumper.

1002
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:32,888
And your horse wins, I'll...

1003
01:22:34,865 --> 01:22:37,527
I'll give you the Walsh farm.

1004
01:22:37,868 --> 01:22:42,896
Nolan. My filly is worth twice as much
as your piece of land.

1005
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:47,904
I tell you what. You lose,
and you come back to work for me.

1006
01:22:48,745 --> 01:22:51,942
Lifetime contract, in writing.

1007
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:58,415
Deal.

1008
01:22:59,856 --> 01:23:02,256
It'll be real nice
to have you back, Nolan.

1009
01:23:08,698 --> 01:23:12,293
All right, no speeches.
You all know what to do. Go get them.

1010
01:23:14,504 --> 01:23:16,734
There he is! Come on, Franny!

1011
01:23:20,510 --> 01:23:23,843
You didn't think we'd let you
have all the glory to yourself.

1012
01:23:24,014 --> 01:23:26,107
Just like old times, Franny.

1013
01:23:39,262 --> 01:23:42,925
Ladies and gentlemen,
the starter has now called the roll.

1014
01:23:45,135 --> 01:23:48,127
The horses are approaching
the starting gate.

1015
01:24:11,361 --> 01:24:13,727
I'm gonna grind you into the track,
pony boy!

1016
01:24:14,498 --> 01:24:16,864
- You're pathetic!
- You're going down!

1017
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:19,600
- Knock you out of the park!
- Gonna get trampled!

1018
01:24:20,003 --> 01:24:21,595
You're a joke!

1019
01:24:37,888 --> 01:24:39,219
They're all in.

1020
01:24:41,525 --> 01:24:45,894
And away they go. Marietta's Rock,
Pirate's cove and Trenton's Pride...

1021
01:24:46,062 --> 01:24:48,826
...came away smartly,
with Jordan's Revenge...

1022
01:24:49,166 --> 01:24:51,498
- Ride, Stripes!
- Go! Come on, Stripes!

1023
01:24:51,668 --> 01:24:54,136
Ruffshodd keeping Stripes
tight on the rail...

1024
01:24:54,304 --> 01:24:57,865
...with Marc's A Mystery,
Flemish Fury and Brown-Nose-Biren.

1025
01:24:58,041 --> 01:25:02,307
As they head into the first corner,
Marietta's Rock's gone ahead to lead...

1026
01:25:02,712 --> 01:25:04,907
You're out of your league, freak!

1027
01:25:05,081 --> 01:25:07,242
You should've stuck
to racing the mailman.

1028
01:25:11,454 --> 01:25:14,719
- Tell Tucker Ruffshodd's got him boxed in!
- Copy that, Goose!

1029
01:25:14,891 --> 01:25:16,256
Ten-four! Roger Wilco!

1030
01:25:16,426 --> 01:25:20,795
Trenton's Pride is back in third.
Stripes is along the inside...

1031
01:25:20,964 --> 01:25:23,899
- Ruffshodd's boxed him in.
- Tell Stripes hug the rail...

1032
01:25:24,067 --> 01:25:27,093
...and make his move at the turn.
- Got it! Let's fly!

1033
01:25:27,537 --> 01:25:28,799
- Hey, Buzz?
- What?

1034
01:25:28,972 --> 01:25:31,668
Did you notice the irony
when you said, "Let's fly"?

1035
01:25:31,841 --> 01:25:34,241
- What are you talking about?
- I'm just asking.

1036
01:25:34,411 --> 01:25:37,972
Because we are flies and all.
Do you ever think about that stuff?

1037
01:25:38,148 --> 01:25:39,672
Would you shut up?

1038
01:25:39,849 --> 01:25:43,080
Tucker says to hug the rail
and make your move at the turn.

1039
01:25:43,253 --> 01:25:45,244
You're doing great!
You're doing great!

1040
01:25:45,422 --> 01:25:50,485
- Mistake. Miyuki's Magic is a long leader
outside, then comes Marc's A Mystery...

1041
01:25:57,567 --> 01:25:59,228
How does the rail taste?

1042
01:26:02,806 --> 01:26:04,774
You'll never see the finish line!

1043
01:26:05,842 --> 01:26:09,608
Ruffshodd's putting the Jersey
squeeze on him. That's a dirty trick!

1044
01:26:09,779 --> 01:26:12,942
Oh, not for long.
Time to take a bite out of crime.

1045
01:26:13,116 --> 01:26:15,209
Oh, I hate horse meat. Here goes.

1046
01:26:17,187 --> 01:26:21,817
- Coming out of the turn. And Ruffshodd
has inexplicably tossed his rider!

1047
01:26:23,426 --> 01:26:25,758
And Ruffshodd is out of the race!

1048
01:26:26,363 --> 01:26:28,354
- Marietta's Rock...
- That's my boy.

1049
01:26:28,531 --> 01:26:31,159
You've always been a pain in the butt.

1050
01:26:34,271 --> 01:26:38,332
They're down the back stretch.
Trenton's Pride is running the perfect race.

1051
01:26:38,508 --> 01:26:42,911
He's moving like an absolute winner.
Trenton's Pride, right up there in third spot.

1052
01:26:43,079 --> 01:26:47,516
The sentimental choice, Stripes, is coming
under pressure and starting to drop back.

1053
01:26:47,684 --> 01:26:50,983
- Stripes seems to be running out of steam.
- Had enough, boy?

1054
01:26:51,154 --> 01:26:55,454
Trenton's Pride is going strongly up
there amongst the leading line.

1055
01:26:55,625 --> 01:26:59,493
Three parts of the way through the race,
Marietta's Rock still in front...

1056
01:26:59,663 --> 01:27:03,599
...from Pirate's cove, then Trenton's Pride
moving like a winner in third.

1057
01:27:03,767 --> 01:27:05,735
It was just too much to ask of him.

1058
01:27:05,902 --> 01:27:07,096
In comes Miyuki's Magic.

1059
01:27:07,671 --> 01:27:09,263
By a league is Pirate's cove...

1060
01:27:09,439 --> 01:27:12,340
- I can't do it. I can't do it!
- Stripes is in the rear.

1061
01:27:20,817 --> 01:27:24,446
- The kid... The kid is wiped out.
- Yeah, he's falling back fast.

1062
01:27:24,621 --> 01:27:27,021
All right. Okay. One last shot.

1063
01:27:27,190 --> 01:27:32,025
You tell him if he believes he's not good
enough, he should stop trying. It's okay.

1064
01:27:32,362 --> 01:27:36,526
This is Superfly. We're proceeding
to the target. Do you copy, Scuzz?

1065
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:40,693
Hey, I told you to use my code name,
Luke Scuzzwalker!

1066
01:27:45,208 --> 01:27:49,542
Kid, listen. Coach says that if you're
not good enough, you should stop trying.

1067
01:27:49,713 --> 01:27:52,648
- It's okay.
- You tell Tucker I've got a message for him!

1068
01:27:56,453 --> 01:28:01,891
Hey! Stripes said to tell you, "Don't
look back, leave it all on the track!"

1069
01:28:02,058 --> 01:28:04,754
Yes! That trick works every time!

1070
01:28:08,398 --> 01:28:13,131
- Good boy! Go, Stripes! Let's go!
- Stripes is starting to get in on the inside.

1071
01:28:13,303 --> 01:28:16,329
Stripes is surging back into contention.

1072
01:28:16,506 --> 01:28:21,466
Trenton's Pride in front, but here comes
Stripes charging along the inside.

1073
01:28:21,644 --> 01:28:25,740
And Stripes is picking them off one by one,
he's coming at Trenton's Pride!

1074
01:28:25,915 --> 01:28:28,475
- Come on, Stripes!
- Stripes! Come on, Stripes!

1075
01:28:28,651 --> 01:28:30,516
Stripes is coming in around the inside.

1076
01:28:38,595 --> 01:28:40,825
- Come on, Channing!
- Come on, Channing!

1077
01:28:40,997 --> 01:28:43,295
These two are now locked together!

1078
01:28:43,466 --> 01:28:45,730
Stripes inside,
finding trouble on the rail.

1079
01:28:45,935 --> 01:28:49,632
Behind him, Trenton's Pride.
These two are head-to-head!

1080
01:28:49,806 --> 01:28:52,673
- Come on!
- Let him run!

1081
01:28:56,446 --> 01:28:59,973
They're head-to-head.
They're inside the final stages!

1082
01:29:00,150 --> 01:29:01,947
Stripes and Trenton's Pride...

1083
01:29:02,118 --> 01:29:04,712
- come on! Yes, yes!
- Come on!

1084
01:29:04,888 --> 01:29:08,380
They're racing up towards the line.
Stripes along the inside.

1085
01:29:08,558 --> 01:29:10,822
- Let him run!
- Come on, Channing!

1086
01:29:10,994 --> 01:29:13,724
Come on! Come on! Run!
Move your butt! Come on!

1087
01:29:44,194 --> 01:29:46,219
- Way to go!
- Yeah!

1088
01:29:49,933 --> 01:29:51,298
Yeah!

1089
01:29:52,936 --> 01:29:54,597
That's my boy right there!

1090
01:29:54,771 --> 01:29:57,604
- Kentucky Open,
he's edged out Trenton's Pride...

1091
01:29:57,941 --> 01:30:01,934
...and Stripes is the winner
of the Kentucky Open...

1092
01:30:02,111 --> 01:30:06,480
...narrowly beating Trenton's Pride
in a driving finish.

1093
01:30:08,952 --> 01:30:11,944
I won. I can't believe I won!

1094
01:30:25,001 --> 01:30:26,901
That's my best boy.

1095
01:30:28,204 --> 01:30:31,264
Come on, hurry up!
We're going to the winner's circle!

1096
01:30:31,441 --> 01:30:33,966
This is his moment, guys. Come on.
He did it!

1097
01:30:43,019 --> 01:30:47,956
Did you see him, Dad? Did you see him?
He almost shot out from underneath me!

1098
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:53,420
Your mom would be so proud.

1099
01:30:53,930 --> 01:30:55,591
And so am I.

1100
01:31:02,005 --> 01:31:04,838
- Hey, Stripey.
- Yeah?

1101
01:31:05,008 --> 01:31:08,842
My father was wrong about you.
You're a great racer.

1102
01:31:09,145 --> 01:31:12,808
Thanks! So are you.
We left it all on the track, didn't we?

1103
01:31:12,982 --> 01:31:15,780
Yeah. Yeah, I guess we did.

1104
01:31:16,252 --> 01:31:17,617
I'll see you at the fence?

1105
01:31:18,121 --> 01:31:20,248
Yeah. See you.

1106
01:31:27,130 --> 01:31:30,759
Great job. You make a lousy gangster,
but you're a stand-up pelican.

1107
01:31:30,934 --> 01:31:33,926
Listen, you mug, I...

1108
01:31:34,103 --> 01:31:37,766
Hey, that's the nicest thing
a very short horse ever said to me.

1109
01:31:38,541 --> 01:31:42,033
Then why don't you stick around here.
We make a pretty good team.

1110
01:31:42,211 --> 01:31:44,475
Now, that's an offer I can't refuse.

1111
01:31:44,647 --> 01:31:47,275
But first there's something
I gotta take care of.

1112
01:31:47,784 --> 01:31:50,548
I demand an inquiry!

1113
01:31:50,954 --> 01:31:52,922
- Do you hear me?
- Channing, over here!

1114
01:31:53,089 --> 01:31:55,785
That zebra was all over the field!

1115
01:31:56,759 --> 01:31:59,853
You listen to me,
I want that zebra disqualified!

1116
01:32:00,530 --> 01:32:04,330
Say hello to my little friend.

1117
01:32:04,901 --> 01:32:08,803
And I insist that you pay attention to...

1118
01:32:14,510 --> 01:32:16,034
To me.

1119
01:32:19,582 --> 01:32:21,607
If you'll excuse me.

1120
01:32:25,755 --> 01:32:28,246
I know how you feel, honey.
It happened to me.

1121
01:32:28,424 --> 01:32:33,555
All I can tell you is rinse, lather and repeat.
Rinse, lather and repeat!

1122
01:32:36,432 --> 01:32:40,766
Is there anybody special you'd like
to dedicate today's victory to?

1123
01:32:49,646 --> 01:32:52,171
Stripes! Stripes! Over here!

1124
01:32:54,150 --> 01:32:56,141
Where's he going?

1125
01:32:56,519 --> 01:32:59,283
Okay, Dean, get him.
Get the animals.

1126
01:32:59,455 --> 01:33:01,685
You should be in the winner's circle.

1127
01:33:01,858 --> 01:33:04,952
We both should be.
I'd be nothing without you.

1128
01:33:10,466 --> 01:33:14,197
- Thanks, kid.
- The roses make you look like Elvis.

1129
01:33:14,837 --> 01:33:17,635
Very Elvis. Very Elvis '75.

1130
01:33:17,907 --> 01:33:21,240
- I'm so proud of you, Stripes.
- Thanks, Sandy.

1131
01:33:22,111 --> 01:33:27,071
Coming through! Coming through!
Big winner! Coming through!

1132
01:33:36,893 --> 01:33:40,226
Yeah! Catch me, baby, catch me!
Get the good side!

1133
01:33:44,133 --> 01:33:45,862
Hey, boy.

1134
01:33:46,335 --> 01:33:48,803
- Say cheese!
- Big smile!
