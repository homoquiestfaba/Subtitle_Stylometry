1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074
Attack of the 60 Foot Centerfold 1995

2
00:00:34,152 --> 00:00:36,731
Are you sure this is a good idea?

3
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:39,449
We will never know, unless we try.

4
00:00:40,475 --> 00:00:43,871
But the dose has increased a lot

5
00:00:44,206 --> 00:00:46,208
If there is no pain there is no gain

6
00:00:49,641 --> 00:00:50,985
? Some friends?

7
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,944
This can also be dangerous
- Yes

8
00:01:01,777 --> 00:01:03,596
Ah ي you have a friend

9
00:01:08,148 --> 00:01:13,786
Everything will be fine, I am aware that the dose is high
but we must see what we are capable of

10
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,446
Talvéz I'm right n

11
00:01:15,654 --> 00:01:17,532
But what about the dangerous part

12
00:01:17,532 --> 00:01:20,094
Well, we should see what this thing does.

13
00:01:20,522 --> 00:01:21,408
Bring the camera

14
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,702
Here is Doctor

15
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:27,155
Let's take some before and after photos

16
00:01:28,995 --> 00:01:32,569
Look at the little bird

17
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:43,680
THE ATTACK OF THE MODELS OF 150 METERS

18
00:04:11,988 --> 00:04:13,096
Wilson come here, come on.

19
00:04:14,186 --> 00:04:14,636
Good.

20
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:29,663
Stu, no more snow.

21
00:04:39,498 --> 00:04:41,264
Beautiful, that, good.

22
00:04:41,523 --> 00:04:42,233
Great.

23
00:04:42,517 --> 00:04:43,552
Stay like that.

24
00:04:45,675 --> 00:04:48,857
Great... you know girls, if it were up to me, they would have my vote

25
00:04:49,003 --> 00:04:50,034
But it's not like that.

26
00:04:50,235 --> 00:04:52,469
When can we meet Mr. Gordon?

27
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,500
He is not supposed to personally select one of us.

28
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,148
Wilson, can you move, please.

29
00:04:57,183 --> 00:04:58,621
In the house on the weekend.

30
00:04:58,829 --> 00:04:59,946
? Really?

31
00:05:00,372 --> 00:05:01,664
? This weekend?

32
00:05:01,665 --> 00:05:03,876
He has invited everyone to his ranch in Malib.

33
00:05:04,457 --> 00:05:06,345
He wants to know each of them personally.

34
00:05:06,926 --> 00:05:10,297
And he wants us to do a special photo session on the beach.

35
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,529
And then you will choose me for the model.

36
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,720
It's a competition, it can be any of you.

37
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,252
What competition?

38
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,922
You really are a bitch.

39
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:23,741
Thanks.

40
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,757
,,, WILSON !!!

41
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:29,033
Could you please get out of my way? Thank you.

42
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,611
Good girls, beautiful, stay there.

43
00:05:35,531 --> 00:05:36,408
Good.

44
00:05:39,946 --> 00:05:40,664
That's it.

45
00:05:47,712 --> 00:05:49,168
Good, another one.

46
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,633
Good girls, let's do it without a bra.

47
00:05:57,817 --> 00:05:59,945
Look how snowy he got.

48
00:05:59,946 --> 00:06:01,726
Leave him alone.

49
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,909
I think he likes you.

50
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,171
Great, to your girls locker room.

51
00:07:39,653 --> 00:07:42,181
I think we all have the chance to win.

52
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:43,798
What do you think Inga?

53
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:45,211
Same.

54
00:07:45,212 --> 00:07:47,206
The two are going to lose.

55
00:07:47,207 --> 00:07:49,136
How can you be so sure?

56
00:07:49,137 --> 00:07:51,508
Have you looked at a mirror lately?

57
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:52,995
What is that supposed to mean?

58
00:07:52,996 --> 00:07:55,840
Hey, calm down, we have not finished n.

59
00:07:55,841 --> 00:08:00,364
I mean, have you looked in the mirror lately?
?how old are you?

60
00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:01,236
? 30?

61
00:08:01,237 --> 00:08:03,136
I look in the mirror all the time.

62
00:08:03,137 --> 00:08:05,011
I'm beautiful.

63
00:08:05,012 --> 00:08:07,535
Is your chest shrinking?

64
00:09:04,526 --> 00:09:08,523
Our records say it has been a year or since you stopped the program.

65
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:12,402
And obviously it works.

66
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,360
You are hermonsa.

67
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:17,369
I know it worked and worked well.

68
00:09:17,369 --> 00:09:19,333
But I have to put it back on him.

69
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:25,493
Grace is praised, we require a waiting period of 5 years before restarting the envelment program, you know.

70
00:09:25,493 --> 00:09:29,951
I know everything, program of envellecimiento, highly experimental.

71
00:09:29,951 --> 00:09:31,581
Highly secret

72
00:09:31,828 --> 00:09:35,361
But why the hell do you want to go back to the show?

73
00:09:35,361 --> 00:09:37,737
She is an extremely attractive woman.

74
00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:42,162
? I need to remind you how I looked before I started with this?

75
00:09:45,531 --> 00:09:47,837
No, you do not need to remind me.

76
00:09:48,808 --> 00:09:50,277
Before.

77
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,178
And later.

78
00:09:58,246 --> 00:10:03,443
Look, I've noticed changes.

79
00:10:05,185 --> 00:10:06,685
Changes in my body.

80
00:10:07,892 --> 00:10:10,413
Do these look smaller?

81
00:10:11,124 --> 00:10:13,100
They seem good to me.

82
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,657
Does this seem firm to you?

83
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,074
Definitely, without doubts.

84
00:10:21,985 --> 00:10:23,409
I can feel it.

85
00:10:23,884 --> 00:10:25,876
My faces are getting old.

86
00:10:25,877 --> 00:10:29,915
That's how old Grace is, Grace, it happens to everyone.

87
00:10:31,377 --> 00:10:34,633
My body is changing, I know.

88
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:38,780
And now I have the opportunity to be the model of a or.

89
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,369
And my breasts are shrinking.

90
00:10:43,836 --> 00:10:44,837
Help me.

91
00:10:44,838 --> 00:10:49,778
Although I would like to do it, it is very risky.

92
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,876
I beg you.

93
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,770
Look...

94
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,606
He has been using the drug of envellecimiendo.

95
00:11:01,606 --> 00:11:04,252
That works with cell growth.

96
00:11:04,252 --> 00:11:08,115
The alternatives for the body can be radically altered.

97
00:11:08,116 --> 00:11:12,178
Using them for a short period, it's safe.

98
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:17,257
Do not bore me with the details Doc, just make it beautiful.

99
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:22,918
If you start with the program so soon, I can not tell you what can happen.

100
00:11:23,306 --> 00:11:24,614
Please.

101
00:11:25,003 --> 00:11:28,144
Your life may be in great danger.

102
00:11:29,065 --> 00:11:30,686
By favorsito.

103
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:39,797
This suitcase contains 30 doses of the formula.

104
00:11:40,356 --> 00:11:43,065
I can take only one dose a day.

105
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:45,444
Neither more nor less.

106
00:11:45,445 --> 00:11:49,236
Any other dose can be fatal.

107
00:11:57,832 --> 00:12:01,604
Whoever is out of my way, do you understand?

108
00:12:01,604 --> 00:12:03,806
What to do here?

109
00:12:04,035 --> 00:12:06,549
S doing some final touches.

110
00:12:08,664 --> 00:12:11,802
Now, who are you looking for?

111
00:12:11,803 --> 00:12:14,413
We were going to send those to Mr. Gordon.

112
00:12:14,414 --> 00:12:16,218
Then, send them out.

113
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:24,273
Betty, destroying the photographs is not going to make you win the competition.
- I know it is a brainiac, but it makes me feel better.

114
00:12:24,274 --> 00:12:29,336
Good, good, tomorrow will be a long day.
- Talvéz if I sleep with him.

115
00:12:29,337 --> 00:12:30,997
With that, it will be enough.

116
00:12:32,054 --> 00:12:34,213
? Sleeping with who?
- Bob Gordon.

117
00:12:34,214 --> 00:12:36,198
I have the whole weekend to work on that.

118
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:38,797
Betty, let me give you a warning about Bob Gordon.

119
00:12:38,798 --> 00:12:40,095
Stay away from him.

120
00:12:40,096 --> 00:12:42,651
He has a girlfriend, who is extremely jealous.

121
00:12:42,652 --> 00:12:46,137
But, you can sleep with me.

122
00:12:46,788 --> 00:12:48,795
How good will that be?

123
00:13:31,235 --> 00:13:33,913
So I like it

124
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,637
? Yes?

125
00:13:40,638 --> 00:13:44,549
Bob speaks Eric, I'm in Lab 4,
I think you should come here.

126
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,549
What's up?

127
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,794
Hurry up

128
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:51,253
? Eric?... Eric?

129
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,272
Oh, God, what have we done?

130
00:14:27,554 --> 00:14:29,348
What devil is going on?

131
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,616
You will not believe this.

132
00:14:32,617 --> 00:14:33,617
Why we do not look.

133
00:14:33,618 --> 00:14:36,076
I would not do that if it were you.

134
00:14:37,182 --> 00:14:39,023
Open that door.

135
00:14:47,121 --> 00:14:49,030
What is that noise?

136
00:14:50,006 --> 00:14:50,859
Good...

137
00:14:56,017 --> 00:15:01,322
I have... I have good news and bad news.

138
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:09,531
No, this is terrible.

139
00:15:09,532 --> 00:15:10,833
What is the good news?

140
00:15:10,988 --> 00:15:12,285
That's the good news.

141
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:19,776
Oh, God.

142
00:15:42,038 --> 00:15:44,915
We should call Gobierto for this.

143
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,696
Without the Government.

144
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,894
Come here and they will take you all.

145
00:15:53,673 --> 00:15:54,893
This is serious.

146
00:15:54,894 --> 00:15:56,881
As well as losing our paycheck.

147
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:00,095
We can deal with this.

148
00:16:00,665 --> 00:16:02,066
We need to call.

149
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:04,159
A good exterminator.

150
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:06,824
An excellent Exterminator.

151
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,049
Hello, hello.

152
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:29,061
Miss Grace, it's Dr. Lindstrom, I need to see her immediately, it's that...
- Ha, she sends you e.

153
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:33,491
I'm not home now, but you can leave me a message and a credit card number.

154
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:39,734
It's Dr. Lindstrom, I need to talk to you, about... from...

155
00:16:39,735 --> 00:16:44,160
Well you know that..., call me when you hear this message, it is urgent.

156
00:16:45,112 --> 00:16:49,007
If you do not hear that message on time it may be too late.

157
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,573
We wish we knew where you are.

158
00:17:28,521 --> 00:17:30,699
Look at this place.

159
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,694
It's incredible.

160
00:17:33,995 --> 00:17:36,060
I wonder if you live only here.

161
00:17:36,061 --> 00:17:40,721
You know, he looks like a fan of architecture.

162
00:17:40,722 --> 00:17:43,548
I would say that Mr. Gordon sold some magazines.

163
00:17:44,475 --> 00:17:45,855
Yes I did.

164
00:17:55,764 --> 00:17:59,128
It has 9 holes.

165
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:03,714
Bob Gordon, owner of PlayThing magazine, a pleasure.

166
00:18:03,971 --> 00:18:06,686
Betty, Betty Bennet, It is November.

167
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:10,077
I was saying what a wonderful home you have here.

168
00:18:10,078 --> 00:18:12,151
Well, thank you, I appreciate it very much.

169
00:18:13,456 --> 00:18:16,339
Inga, Inga Sorensen.

170
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,011
He is urinating ..
- I know, Julio is urged, I will never forget him.

171
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:23,634
I'm very horny to meet you.

172
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:28,724
Good, and you should be marching March.

173
00:18:28,725 --> 00:18:30,986
My friends call me Angel.

174
00:18:30,987 --> 00:18:32,123
Angel.

175
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,665
Betty... Inga...

176
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,951
I am very happy because they could come.

177
00:18:36,952 --> 00:18:40,994
Let's go inside and I'll give you the tour of the PlayThing mansion.

178
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:43,758
And of course we will arrive just for dinner.

179
00:18:54,586 --> 00:18:56,356
Rosita, the suitcases.

180
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,011
We can help you.

181
00:19:00,012 --> 00:19:02,691
No, nonsense, she can alone.

182
00:19:02,692 --> 00:19:04,267
? Are you sure?

183
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,868
We do not care.

184
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:09,696
No, no, no, I'm the right kind of man.

185
00:19:09,697 --> 00:19:13,468
Well, what do they say if we go in and start the tour?

186
00:19:20,788 --> 00:19:24,536
Well you pray, here we are, the mansion n Plaything.

187
00:19:46,363 --> 00:19:48,224
One of the most friendly places in the world.

188
00:19:48,225 --> 00:19:50,837
Rosita, does not look very friendly.

189
00:19:50,838 --> 00:19:55,004
Well, I do not pay much attention, it's always the same.

190
00:19:55,845 --> 00:19:58,268
Good servitude is hard to find.

191
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:03,758
Servitude, Rosita, not her is not servitude,
I do not need servitude. She's my girlfriend.

192
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:07,105
Well the rooms are on the west side.

193
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:09,259
And the east wing in the night.

194
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:33,536
I would like to propose a toast.

195
00:20:34,425 --> 00:20:35,791
For you three prayers.

196
00:20:36,581 --> 00:20:42,160
The finalists the tenth contest is Ordered Plaything of a o.

197
00:20:42,161 --> 00:20:45,824
It has always been a difficult decision.

198
00:20:45,825 --> 00:20:49,788
But when looking at you, I must say that this is or is not an exception.

199
00:20:50,668 --> 00:20:53,482
? We will not take photos on the beach?

200
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:56,796
Your beach

201
00:21:00,931 --> 00:21:02,683
It has its beach plropia.

202
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:06,181
No, it's only 4 miles from it.

203
00:21:06,428 --> 00:21:09,327
I can suggest a small dessert.

204
00:21:09,328 --> 00:21:11,710
And then have a good night sleep.

205
00:21:11,711 --> 00:21:14,610
You can suggest anything you want.

206
00:21:18,018 --> 00:21:21,377
You know I want the best of you.

207
00:21:22,244 --> 00:21:24,589
I like to meet people.

208
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,593
Rosita... dessert.

209
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,727
That looks delicious.

210
00:21:48,378 --> 00:21:50,424
I do not want a big piece.

211
00:21:51,192 --> 00:21:52,363
Thanks.

212
00:21:57,933 --> 00:22:01,844
Rosita, sometimes she gets a little jealous.

213
00:22:01,845 --> 00:22:05,465
But, do not worry, she has never hurt anyone.

214
00:22:05,756 --> 00:22:07,038
I apologize a moment.

215
00:22:10,969 --> 00:22:14,336
She has never hurt anyone.
- I told them to stay away from him.

216
00:22:14,337 --> 00:22:17,567
Not that you say it.
- So that's your game.

217
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,564
Sleeping with him to be chosen the model of the o

218
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:26,242
You are so predictable.
- Yes, I saw you touching it under the table, bitch.

219
00:22:26,243 --> 00:22:28,844
Or, this can last for hours.

220
00:22:28,845 --> 00:22:30,998
I think I'll make up my nose.

221
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:33,903
I know it after I saw you did not touch it first.

222
00:22:33,904 --> 00:22:36,183
Putilla.
Slippery.

223
00:22:36,184 --> 00:22:38,195
If you pray, excuse me...

224
00:22:38,196 --> 00:22:39,779
You plan to stay.

225
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,865
Yes, this is exciting me.

226
00:22:41,866 --> 00:22:43,614
Sow
Cow.

227
00:22:47,516 --> 00:22:48,985
Maraca.
Putilla.

228
00:22:49,231 --> 00:22:50,461
You already used that.

229
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,359
Mark, what a surprise.

230
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,359
I thought we could have a few drinks, and discuss the morning session.

231
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,091
I'm really tired.

232
00:23:20,092 --> 00:23:23,864
You know, I spoke well of you Bob.

233
00:23:23,865 --> 00:23:25,632
I hope you appreciate it.

234
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:28,909
If I appreciate it, but not tonight.

235
00:23:29,744 --> 00:23:30,670
? Safe?

236
00:23:55,313 --> 00:23:58,423
Wow, what a surprise.

237
00:23:58,424 --> 00:24:02,736
I thought we could have some drinks, and discuss the morning session.

238
00:24:04,223 --> 00:24:04,942
? What?

239
00:24:05,554 --> 00:24:11,618
Let me guess, you spoke well of my Bob, and now you want to see if I appreciate it.

240
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:13,775
? How do you know?

241
00:24:13,864 --> 00:24:17,232
You used that line 6 months ago in the Pleybunny session.

242
00:24:17,762 --> 00:24:22,590
Let me ask you something, I used that line with Inga before?
- Many times.

243
00:24:24,343 --> 00:24:27,227
But I do not think the allas used with Angel.

244
00:24:28,764 --> 00:24:30,753
You know, I think you're right.

245
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,302
Thanks.

246
00:24:33,422 --> 00:24:34,950
Neither mention it.

247
00:24:42,675 --> 00:24:43,852
Here you are.

248
00:24:59,204 --> 00:25:02,292
Everything's over
- All.

249
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,366
I have a confession to make.
- What.

250
00:25:33,654 --> 00:25:34,733
I'm drunk.

251
00:25:37,165 --> 00:25:38,870
I like that in my women.

252
00:25:40,489 --> 00:25:42,422
I have another confession.

253
00:25:43,061 --> 00:25:44,255
Confess me.

254
00:25:45,664 --> 00:25:51,059
I've always told Wilson that I think you're handsome.

255
00:25:52,922 --> 00:25:55,203
Well, that's a coincidence.

256
00:25:55,204 --> 00:25:55,858
Why?

257
00:25:56,792 --> 00:26:00,592
Because, I also think that you are pretty.

258
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:03,889
? Deveras?

259
00:26:12,762 --> 00:26:13,870
Deveras.

260
00:26:21,308 --> 00:26:23,353
Should we be doing this?

261
00:26:23,353 --> 00:26:26,905
I feel a little stunned.

262
00:26:30,354 --> 00:26:32,242
I feel the same.

263
00:26:32,945 --> 00:26:34,840
Stunned.

264
00:26:36,534 --> 00:26:38,073
Passionate

265
00:27:56,474 --> 00:28:00,775
"See you on the beach... Mark"

266
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:03,149
The beach

267
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:08,431
Oh, God... the photo shoot

268
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,568
Beautiful.
Now, look towards me.

269
00:28:37,198 --> 00:28:38,089
One more.

270
00:28:48,741 --> 00:28:49,713
Do not be panic

271
00:28:51,862 --> 00:28:52,858
Do not be panic

272
00:29:06,748 --> 00:29:07,658
Be phoenix

273
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:10,611
What am I going to do?

274
00:29:29,922 --> 00:29:30,804
That's it, stay that way.

275
00:29:30,805 --> 00:29:31,670
Beautiful.

276
00:29:33,286 --> 00:29:35,107
Cari or this is to break the heart.

277
00:29:37,528 --> 00:29:39,617
I'm sure this will work

278
00:30:12,847 --> 00:30:13,601
Good, look at me.

279
00:30:13,602 --> 00:30:14,858
Make love to the camera.

280
00:30:14,859 --> 00:30:16,399
Look at the lens, that's it.

281
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:18,236
Beautiful.

282
00:30:18,237 --> 00:30:19,864
That's it, stay that way.

283
00:30:22,725 --> 00:30:24,835
Mmmm, Angel was late.

284
00:30:26,981 --> 00:30:28,228
I can go find her.

285
00:30:28,887 --> 00:30:30,636
I mean, it's just so...

286
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:32,704
We can give you 5 more minutes.

287
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,343
Good, stay like that.

288
00:31:03,776 --> 00:31:05,077
What size are these?

289
00:31:14,027 --> 00:31:17,156
Wilson, can you remove it from there?

290
00:31:21,369 --> 00:31:22,266
One more.

291
00:31:27,707 --> 00:31:29,784
Launch them, throw them.

292
00:31:31,294 --> 00:31:31,950
Great.

293
00:31:32,356 --> 00:31:33,806
Hey, here you are.

294
00:31:34,598 --> 00:31:35,450
Hello.

295
00:31:35,451 --> 00:31:36,665
What a pleasure you came.

296
00:31:36,665 --> 00:31:37,847
Sorry to be late.

297
00:31:37,847 --> 00:31:39,202
Do not worry, we are just beginning.

298
00:31:41,465 --> 00:31:42,578
Are you not using tacos?

299
00:31:42,813 --> 00:31:44,064
? Should I?

300
00:31:44,064 --> 00:31:45,683
No, no, no, that's what...

301
00:31:46,146 --> 00:31:48,783
You seem... higher

302
00:31:49,643 --> 00:31:50,329
? S ي?

303
00:31:52,402 --> 00:31:54,594
What vitamins are you taking?

304
00:31:54,736 --> 00:31:55,857
I do not know

305
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,240
Good, good, come together.

306
00:32:05,974 --> 00:32:06,627
That's it.

307
00:32:09,698 --> 00:32:11,726
You are taller than me.

308
00:32:12,749 --> 00:32:14,587
Well you pray, let me see some skin.

309
00:33:00,553 --> 00:33:02,657
Great, beautiful.

310
00:33:06,566 --> 00:33:07,349
Recharge.

311
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,621
I'm sorry you are praying, take a few minutes.

312
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,768
? Do you feel good?

313
00:33:17,908 --> 00:33:21,540
Good, good, is that I had a few drinks last night

314
00:33:22,037 --> 00:33:22,919
I'm fine.

315
00:33:26,065 --> 00:33:27,250
Mark.

316
00:33:29,771 --> 00:33:30,482
Come on.

317
00:33:33,671 --> 00:33:36,987
Mmmm, it seems that competition is becoming easier

318
00:33:36,987 --> 00:33:38,036
Shut up.

319
00:33:38,574 --> 00:33:40,526
Do you think it gets better?
- It seems to me that it's fine.

320
00:33:40,527 --> 00:33:42,087
No, she does not seem well.

321
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:46,608
Well Wilson, I'll come back and I'll bring help.
- I also.

322
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:48,016
I go with you.

323
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:49,915
S-S hurry up.

324
00:33:50,645 --> 00:33:51,457
Hurry.

325
00:34:06,373 --> 00:34:10,062
No, no, no, no, it's incredible, you'll love it.

326
00:34:12,792 --> 00:34:15,492
Mr. Gordon, we need an ambulance, right away.

327
00:34:15,493 --> 00:34:17,519
It's Angel, fainted on the beach.

328
00:34:18,107 --> 00:34:19,430
Wait a moment, please.

329
00:34:20,499 --> 00:34:21,914
What?

330
00:34:27,355 --> 00:34:30,240
? Where is it?
- I was here with Wilson.

331
00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:31,672
WILSON.

332
00:34:32,158 --> 00:34:35,071
You are probably on a side giving mouth-to-mouth breathing.

333
00:34:35,536 --> 00:34:36,806
WILSON.

334
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:41,889
Hey, here I am.

335
00:34:43,412 --> 00:34:45,174
Where is Angel?
?He is okay?

336
00:34:45,531 --> 00:34:47,214
Define well.

337
00:34:53,564 --> 00:34:54,969
Hello angel.

338
00:34:59,289 --> 00:35:02,988
Ooooo... my...
- God.

339
00:35:06,443 --> 00:35:10,207
E-e-e-ste is Bob Gordon, cancel the ambulance.

340
00:35:11,205 --> 00:35:12,753
Wilson, how the heck did this happen?

341
00:35:12,753 --> 00:35:18,416
I do not know, she only grew it, and it grew and grew.

342
00:35:20,591 --> 00:35:22,257
I'm scared.

343
00:35:23,015 --> 00:35:23,258
Do you have any idea that... how is this?

344
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,711
All I remember is feeling a bit dizzy.

345
00:35:31,593 --> 00:35:33,603
When I woke up...

346
00:35:35,264 --> 00:35:36,969
... help me, I'm huge.

347
00:35:37,486 --> 00:35:41,100
Good, good, let's calm down, it's all right Angel.

348
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,892
We will take care of you.

349
00:35:51,263 --> 00:35:56,054
Well, what are your references are or...?
- Sticker.

350
00:35:56,331 --> 00:35:59,093
Dick Stricker.

351
00:36:02,971 --> 00:36:04,447
Pretty boots.

352
00:36:07,263 --> 00:36:09,115
I could take them from my desk, please.

353
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,106
Rat leather.

354
00:36:11,726 --> 00:36:14,211
Genuine rat leather.

355
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:16,657
Perd n.

356
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,418
I made them myself.

357
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:22,647
You need other references.

358
00:36:22,967 --> 00:36:26,978
Do you have any idea of the type of problems we have?

359
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:28,973
He has a rat.

360
00:36:28,974 --> 00:36:30,890
It is not an ordinary rat.

361
00:36:37,014 --> 00:36:38,292
I never heard.

362
00:36:38,293 --> 00:36:41,269
You can not smoke in this building.

363
00:36:48,317 --> 00:36:49,759
When can you start?

364
00:36:57,718 --> 00:37:02,328
Take the one, not more.

365
00:37:03,435 --> 00:37:06,696
Any other dose can be fatal

366
00:37:17,979 --> 00:37:19,599
We must do something.

367
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,240
Call someone.

368
00:37:21,558 --> 00:37:22,509
? Who?

369
00:37:23,005 --> 00:37:24,603
I do not know, a Doctor.

370
00:37:26,524 --> 00:37:31,508
You know I have a funny feeling that you will not find
_ giant women in the yellow pages

371
00:37:31,509 --> 00:37:34,805
In addition, we must keep it a secret for now.

372
00:37:34,806 --> 00:37:35,803
Why?

373
00:37:37,938 --> 00:37:42,370
I want you to tell Angel that we will send him specialists
That will give us the time we need.

374
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:43,915
? Give us time?

375
00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:45,055
What are you talking about?

376
00:37:46,042 --> 00:37:47,351
Never learn what you owe.

377
00:37:47,902 --> 00:37:50,449
Marky I'm talking about the great image.

378
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:51,873
I'm talking...

379
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:57,175
The model of 150 meters.

380
00:38:01,587 --> 00:38:06,765
? Do you have any idea how much this chicha costs in sales for Plaything?

381
00:38:06,766 --> 00:38:09,072
Boby, have you gone crazy?

382
00:38:11,304 --> 00:38:12,916
60 million.

383
00:38:15,006 --> 00:38:15,922
? So much?

384
00:38:17,659 --> 00:38:18,701
Maybe so.

385
00:38:19,447 --> 00:38:20,906
It is is...

386
00:38:20,907 --> 00:38:25,929
It's... like a million for a foot.

387
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,598
Yes.

388
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,120
And you could have one of those feet if you help me.

389
00:38:32,657 --> 00:38:33,982
What do you say Marky?

390
00:38:33,983 --> 00:38:37,104
No, take your time, think about it.

391
00:38:38,137 --> 00:38:39,474
? 60 million?

392
00:38:41,123 --> 00:38:44,913
Come on, you tell me she's cute with you, just use it a little.

393
00:38:44,913 --> 00:38:46,795
I can do that, I can do it.

394
00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:47,796
? For how long?

395
00:38:48,647 --> 00:38:51,764
It's enough to exploit it.

396
00:38:52,308 --> 00:38:53,629
And after charging.

397
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:56,003
I will call some friends that I have in the Government.

398
00:38:56,004 --> 00:38:58,146
And they will get her out of here.

399
00:38:58,306 --> 00:39:00,220
What will you do?

400
00:39:00,667 --> 00:39:02,226
Marky, what do you care?

401
00:39:02,227 --> 00:39:05,052
I do not know, experiments, I think.

402
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:07,387
What difference there is, I have a contract with her.

403
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:10,142
So keep this quiet, okay?

404
00:39:10,653 --> 00:39:11,575
The first thing I will do.

405
00:39:11,998 --> 00:39:17,165
I will take pictures and I will throw it to the public.

406
00:39:17,695 --> 00:39:20,809
We will make a fortune.

407
00:40:00,475 --> 00:40:02,189
It was not a dream

408
00:40:20,857 --> 00:40:21,409
Hey.

409
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,120
What are t and Bob plotting?

410
00:40:25,488 --> 00:40:26,100
What do you mean?

411
00:40:26,101 --> 00:40:27,759
I heard them talking about Angel.

412
00:40:28,256 --> 00:40:31,741
Look, keep your mouth closed on this.

413
00:40:31,742 --> 00:40:33,160
Do not you worry about her at all?

414
00:40:33,161 --> 00:40:35,313
Wilson, we're talking a lot of direct.

415
00:40:35,804 --> 00:40:37,029
I care about her.

416
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:39,833
I need to remind you that I am the one she cares about.

417
00:40:40,036 --> 00:40:41,753
She's hot for me, not you, partner.

418
00:40:42,251 --> 00:40:43,133
Face it.

419
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:44,403
Partner.

420
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:50,518
You gain something... you lose something.

421
00:41:11,086 --> 00:41:12,571
I smell a rodent.

422
00:41:12,572 --> 00:41:14,234
This is where we lost it.

423
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:19,181
The rat has been seen in many places in the building, we have not been able to record it.

424
00:41:20,474 --> 00:41:21,342
Good.

425
00:41:30,934 --> 00:41:35,205
I want to go in, I have work to do.

426
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:33,144
It's time for fun.

427
00:42:39,935 --> 00:42:40,952
Come on Micky.

428
00:42:54,771 --> 00:42:56,631
Come and look for it.

429
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:11,039
You're a little kid, are not you?

430
00:43:49,064 --> 00:43:50,569
Angel, dear.

431
00:43:51,592 --> 00:43:52,653
Angel, are you here?

432
00:43:56,359 --> 00:43:58,589
? Where is that big fool?

433
00:43:59,280 --> 00:43:59,995
? Angel?

434
00:44:07,695 --> 00:44:08,578
? Mark?

435
00:44:09,112 --> 00:44:10,157
How do you feel?

436
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:12,697
I'm scared.

437
00:44:12,697 --> 00:44:14,334
Do not worry, everything will be fine.

438
00:44:14,811 --> 00:44:15,745
I confide in me.

439
00:44:16,803 --> 00:44:18,583
We will return to normal soon.

440
00:44:19,494 --> 00:44:21,001
? And what if not?

441
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:23,172
What will happen to me?

442
00:44:23,898 --> 00:44:25,750
Here, are you for you?

443
00:44:33,444 --> 00:44:35,887
? Can you contact my Doctor for me?

444
00:44:36,542 --> 00:44:38,857
His name ed Paul Lindstrom.

445
00:44:38,858 --> 00:44:40,638
He has a clinic in L.A.

446
00:44:40,948 --> 00:44:42,377
Tell him what happened.

447
00:44:42,695 --> 00:44:45,466
Yes, yes, sure, what you want dear.

448
00:44:45,466 --> 00:44:48,019
What will happen to me?

449
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:51,916
Everything will be fine, Bob is calling specialists.

450
00:44:51,916 --> 00:44:53,857
I hope they come soon.

451
00:45:04,478 --> 00:45:05,302
? Is it okay?

452
00:45:08,265 --> 00:45:09,532
Good.

453
00:45:10,421 --> 00:45:12,067
I think it's the flowers.

454
00:45:13,153 --> 00:45:14,648
Better the boto.

455
00:45:15,314 --> 00:45:17,323
Yes, you must be careful.

456
00:45:33,005 --> 00:45:34,194
? Is it okay?

457
00:45:38,577 --> 00:45:42,212
Yes, it's about relaxing, I'll see you later.

458
00:45:44,444 --> 00:45:45,583
? Mark?

459
00:45:47,423 --> 00:45:51,971
Do you want to enter a moment?

460
00:45:51,971 --> 00:45:54,977
I do not think it's a good idea for now.

461
00:45:54,977 --> 00:45:55,992
Talvéz later.

462
00:45:56,399 --> 00:45:57,825
Do not be afraid

463
00:45:59,828 --> 00:46:06,424
Talvéz measures 150 meters, but I'm still a woman.

464
00:46:06,424 --> 00:46:09,760
It is that I have a tremendous headache at this time.

465
00:46:10,111 --> 00:46:11,063
How about tomorrow?

466
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,052
? Did you believe it?

467
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:42,878
Everything.

468
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:44,615
The whole story.

469
00:46:46,185 --> 00:46:48,089
He asked me to make his Doctor.

470
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,442
What did you say?
- I told him I would.

471
00:46:51,443 --> 00:46:53,220
But it is something comical.

472
00:46:53,298 --> 00:46:55,690
I can not remember the name the type.

473
00:46:57,943 --> 00:46:59,257
Good boy.

474
00:47:14,512 --> 00:47:16,425
Doc, where do you want this?

475
00:47:16,426 --> 00:47:20,670
I want her on the third floor, something funny happens, come on.

476
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:23,637
Are you sure it's okay?

477
00:47:23,638 --> 00:47:24,911
Nothing hurts him.

478
00:47:24,912 --> 00:47:28,020
Do not be ridiculous, those men are professionals.

479
00:47:30,825 --> 00:47:32,232
Come on.

480
00:47:34,657 --> 00:47:38,725
Well girls, the good news is that Angel will be fine.

481
00:47:38,726 --> 00:47:40,879
I'm making it as comfortable as I can.

482
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:45,080
I even sent a specialist to come see.

483
00:47:45,494 --> 00:47:47,357
And what about the competition?

484
00:47:48,255 --> 00:47:51,025
Well, I'll need a few more days to decide.

485
00:47:51,026 --> 00:47:56,123
You will understand, but this does not mean that the contest is over.

486
00:47:56,385 --> 00:47:59,207
It's a delay, but this is resolved.

487
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:03,829
Meanwhile, I want you to keep the closed vocals about Angel.

488
00:48:05,043 --> 00:48:06,451
? When can we see it?

489
00:48:07,246 --> 00:48:13,358
I do not think it is prudent to disturb her
the poor one is very upset.

490
00:48:19,348 --> 00:48:23,383
A n does not know anything about Angel Grace.
- Nothing is answered by the answering machine.

491
00:48:29,577 --> 00:48:31,199
Jur that I heard something.

492
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,832
? That is absolutely necessary?

493
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:36,429
We do not know how big that rat is.

494
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:38,828
Be careful with that thing.

495
00:48:38,889 --> 00:48:40,114
Good.

496
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,429
Come on.

497
00:49:00,171 --> 00:49:03,052
It's enough, I resign.

498
00:49:18,916 --> 00:49:20,339
Ready for today's action.

499
00:49:20,968 --> 00:49:24,853
I brought my camera to take some pictures.

500
00:49:24,854 --> 00:49:26,858
I'm very tired.

501
00:49:26,859 --> 00:49:31,216
I really want to start with modeling, not as soon as possible.

502
00:49:31,217 --> 00:49:35,463
Talvéz ma ana, could you locate Dr. Lindstrom?

503
00:49:36,198 --> 00:49:40,070
Look, it's 12 o'clock, I should be here already, I'll ask Bob later.

504
00:49:40,826 --> 00:49:43,700
I want to be normal again, that's all.

505
00:49:43,701 --> 00:49:46,972
Cari or t you are normal, except for the part of the 150 meters.

506
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,877
I feel so extra to.

507
00:49:49,878 --> 00:49:53,024
How Godzilla or something.

508
00:49:53,025 --> 00:49:54,965
You are much more beautiful than Godzilla.

509
00:49:55,995 --> 00:49:58,273
No without makeup.

510
00:49:58,274 --> 00:50:01,322
That reminds me, I have something to make you happy.

511
00:50:01,323 --> 00:50:02,445
WILSON.

512
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:04,583
Wilson, bring it.

513
00:50:05,349 --> 00:50:06,261
? Bring that?

514
00:50:06,262 --> 00:50:09,700
Something Bob ordered to do specially for you, I hope you enjoy it.

515
00:50:09,701 --> 00:50:10,863
Wilson, come on.

516
00:50:15,083 --> 00:50:15,874
Hey...

517
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,396
What is that?

518
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:26,277
Lipstick

519
00:50:29,163 --> 00:50:30,576
Thanks.

520
00:50:30,577 --> 00:50:32,190
And how is the food?

521
00:50:36,314 --> 00:50:39,880
You know what I really need now.

522
00:50:42,549 --> 00:50:43,513
? What?

523
00:51:00,427 --> 00:51:01,931
? Can I help you?

524
00:51:02,337 --> 00:51:03,393
Yes...

525
00:51:05,112 --> 00:51:07,131
Can I order 250 Fatburgesas?

526
00:51:07,321 --> 00:51:08,391
Please.

527
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:13,354
Do you want fries with that?

528
00:51:13,708 --> 00:51:14,527
Yes.

529
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:18,657
? To serve or carry?

530
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:19,579
To carry.

531
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:20,809
Definitely to carry.

532
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:22,581
Yes, of course.

533
00:51:43,573 --> 00:51:45,170
I hope this works.

534
00:51:45,171 --> 00:51:46,726
Well let me show you.

535
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:54,865
Here is Angel Grace and here is the rat.
- I know, the differences do not tell me.

536
00:51:54,866 --> 00:51:57,943
We'll do this to that.

537
00:51:57,944 --> 00:51:59,606
And do it small or again.

538
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:06,959
Care.

539
00:52:27,024 --> 00:52:28,346
You did it.

540
00:52:29,161 --> 00:52:29,903
We did it.

541
00:52:30,214 --> 00:52:32,924
Yes, we did, right?

542
00:52:35,951 --> 00:52:38,767
Now we need to locate Angel Grace.

543
00:52:45,485 --> 00:52:47,442
Well, this presents a problem.

544
00:52:49,689 --> 00:52:52,047
At least Angel is not a rat.

545
00:52:52,048 --> 00:52:53,048
It's not what I hear.

546
00:53:22,975 --> 00:53:25,168
Wilson, what time is it?

547
00:53:26,591 --> 00:53:27,574
It's too late.

548
00:53:28,176 --> 00:53:29,707
Listen, we need to talk.

549
00:53:43,357 --> 00:53:46,282
Listen, I do not have much time

550
00:53:46,283 --> 00:53:48,782
If they know I was talking to you, I will have serious problems.

551
00:53:49,942 --> 00:53:51,050
Who are they?

552
00:53:51,051 --> 00:53:52,343
Mark and Mr. Gordon.

553
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,884
What are you talking about?

554
00:53:54,885 --> 00:53:56,522
Angel, they're just using you.

555
00:53:56,523 --> 00:53:59,969
Plan to continue with the model and explore.

556
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:02,604
And then turn yourself in to the government to get tested.

557
00:54:02,605 --> 00:54:04,973
But it will bring specialists to help me.

558
00:54:04,974 --> 00:54:07,259
They told you that, just to keep you here.

559
00:54:07,782 --> 00:54:09,209
I do not think so.

560
00:54:09,555 --> 00:54:11,844
I try to make you see.

561
00:54:11,845 --> 00:54:12,714
? See what?

562
00:54:12,715 --> 00:54:14,201
That Mark does not love you.

563
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:16,614
But I do.

564
00:54:17,329 --> 00:54:18,185
Wilson.

565
00:54:18,875 --> 00:54:20,734
I do not want to be hurt Angel.

566
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:27,472
I am a woman, I can take care of myself.

567
00:54:27,473 --> 00:54:28,198
But...

568
00:54:28,654 --> 00:54:30,042
You're wrong with Mark.

569
00:54:30,043 --> 00:54:32,428
I know you care about me.

570
00:54:33,301 --> 00:54:34,911
And I'm glad that you too.

571
00:54:35,422 --> 00:54:38,269
Yes... I better go.

572
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:39,725
Do me a favor...

573
00:54:40,216 --> 00:54:42,487
Follow up with the Clinica Lindstrom in L.A.

574
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:44,589
And talk to Dr. Paul Lidstrom

575
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:47,294
And ask him, why has not he arrived?

576
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:49,694
Who is Dr. Lindstrom, Angel?

577
00:54:49,695 --> 00:54:51,191
He's my Doctor.

578
00:54:51,192 --> 00:54:54,607
And I told Mark to tell him it was an emergency and I told him that...

579
00:54:54,966 --> 00:54:56,851
? And what if Mark did not make the call?

580
00:54:58,166 --> 00:55:00,073
Mark would not do that to me.

581
00:55:06,607 --> 00:55:07,363
? O s ي?

582
00:55:25,189 --> 00:55:26,666
What are you doing?

583
00:55:26,667 --> 00:55:28,398
I'm doing the same thing as you.

584
00:55:28,399 --> 00:55:29,687
I was hungry.

585
00:55:29,688 --> 00:55:33,372
That's not the kitchen, it's Bob Gordon's bedroom.

586
00:55:33,373 --> 00:55:36,577
? Really ?, I had no idea.

587
00:55:36,578 --> 00:55:38,052
That's wrong

588
00:55:38,053 --> 00:55:39,494
What are you doing here?

589
00:55:40,273 --> 00:55:42,007
I was also hungry.

590
00:55:57,453 --> 00:56:00,254
49 beer bottle on the wall

591
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:02,678
49 beer bottle.

592
00:56:03,178 --> 00:56:06,477
But a bottle fell.

593
00:56:06,478 --> 00:56:09,172
49 beer bottles on the wall

594
00:56:09,173 --> 00:56:12,462
You know, I can not stand the drunks.

595
00:56:12,548 --> 00:56:13,751
Give me a beer.

596
00:56:15,604 --> 00:56:18,512
Friends, do not allow friends to drive drunk.

597
00:56:18,513 --> 00:56:19,310
? Yes?

598
00:56:20,221 --> 00:56:23,103
And friends, do not allow friends to walk home either.

599
00:56:24,823 --> 00:56:25,540
Good point.

600
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:42,372
? Did you see that?

601
00:56:44,098 --> 00:56:44,878
? What?

602
00:56:47,966 --> 00:56:49,305
I do not know.

603
00:56:49,961 --> 00:56:52,332
They were like a pair of giant legs.

604
00:56:54,192 --> 00:56:56,612
Yes... sure.

605
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,047
Let's go.

606
00:57:08,182 --> 00:57:09,921
I swear I saw something.

607
00:57:11,674 --> 00:57:12,854
? You smell?

608
00:57:13,332 --> 00:57:15,039
It's like perfume.

609
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,685
Shut up, you're still drunk.

610
00:57:32,875 --> 00:57:34,218
There is something out there.

611
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:37,072
No, it's probably a tremor or something.

612
00:57:37,073 --> 00:57:38,389
Excuse me.

613
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:40,761
Can you tell me the way to the village?

614
00:57:49,539 --> 00:57:51,440
What idiots.

615
00:57:53,016 --> 00:57:59,815
Or yes, you could see them in the sky as clear as water.

616
00:57:59,816 --> 00:58:06,671
They fly in the sky like lightning flashes, like flying relamists.

617
00:58:09,656 --> 00:58:13,287
? That was before or after being abducted by aliens?

618
00:58:13,288 --> 00:58:17,040
Before, I never saw them coming.

619
00:58:18,642 --> 00:58:20,252
? Say that the leader has a name?

620
00:58:20,253 --> 00:58:21,253
Or yes, so I can say your name e-e-e-ra Regie.

621
00:58:26,411 --> 00:58:27,368
? Regie?

622
00:58:27,369 --> 00:58:29,108
Yes, Regie.

623
00:58:29,109 --> 00:58:33,913
Well, you never know what you want to say, in another language.

624
00:58:33,914 --> 00:58:35,503
I think it was Regie.

625
00:58:35,504 --> 00:58:37,372
You know, it sounded like Regie.

626
00:58:37,373 --> 00:58:39,234
When I asked him he said...

627
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:40,929
What's your name, mate?

628
00:58:41,757 --> 00:58:48,605
And he looked me straight in the eye and said... Regie... Regie.

629
00:58:48,653 --> 00:58:49,567
As same.

630
00:58:50,368 --> 00:58:52,437
And he said he was going back tonight.

631
00:58:53,349 --> 00:58:58,428
The mother ship has, that must be like now.

632
00:58:58,429 --> 00:59:00,881
That's why I called your newspaper.

633
00:59:00,882 --> 00:59:03,027
For you to tell how it was.

634
00:59:03,028 --> 00:59:05,613
Nothing affects you Se or.

635
00:59:05,614 --> 00:59:07,330
Yes the daily inquisitor.

636
00:59:07,331 --> 00:59:09,717
Integrity is his middle name.

637
00:59:12,513 --> 00:59:13,734
I have a client.

638
00:59:21,993 --> 00:59:23,535
10 and make it fast

639
00:59:23,536 --> 00:59:25,067
I know what I saw.

640
00:59:25,068 --> 00:59:27,266
And you saw it also because you were with me.

641
00:59:28,426 --> 00:59:29,395
Shut your mouth, fine.

642
00:59:29,396 --> 00:59:30,550
What did he just say?

643
00:59:30,551 --> 00:59:32,718
Do not believe what we saw.

644
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:33,751
What was it?

645
00:59:33,752 --> 00:59:36,422
It was a woman, a giant woman.

646
00:59:36,736 --> 00:59:37,568
? How big?

647
00:59:37,569 --> 00:59:41,421
It was there, it was about 100 meters.
- Shut up.

648
00:59:41,422 --> 00:59:43,399
We did not see anything,?

649
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:46,194
Not started a n.
- Well, hurry up, we want to leave here.

650
00:59:46,195 --> 00:59:47,195
You should also leave.

651
00:59:47,196 --> 00:59:48,196
I can not leave, I'm waiting for the mother ship.

652
00:59:51,968 --> 00:59:53,975
Are you all crazy around here?

653
00:59:54,484 --> 00:59:55,567
Only me.

654
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,899
Hey, do not they want your fuel?

655
01:00:05,105 --> 01:00:06,325
Where is it going?

656
01:00:06,948 --> 01:00:11,743
To look for a woman, and exit the mother ship by me.

657
01:00:31,701 --> 01:00:32,781
They are late.

658
01:00:43,936 --> 01:00:46,506
WELCOME TO SEASCAPE

659
01:01:36,376 --> 01:01:37,109
Hello.

660
01:01:37,515 --> 01:01:39,066
Would it bother you to give me a drink?

661
01:01:39,932 --> 01:01:42,707
Take everything is orita, I can not anymore.

662
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:52,788
Thanks.

663
01:01:54,579 --> 01:01:55,584
Do not mention it.

664
01:02:11,712 --> 01:02:13,192
What will I do?

665
01:02:28,527 --> 01:02:31,204
Yes, Daily the Inquisitor.

666
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:32,777
What do you want?

667
01:02:35,552 --> 01:02:36,295
A lot

668
01:02:36,831 --> 01:02:38,796
What the hell are you doing there?

669
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:40,897
Look, something happened.

670
01:02:40,898 --> 01:02:42,468
I will need one more days.

671
01:02:42,469 --> 01:02:47,116
Flying saucer or not, it was supposed to come back yesterday.

672
01:02:47,117 --> 01:02:50,426
Someone said that I saw a giant woman.

673
01:02:50,427 --> 01:02:54,573
We have a date, now take the next flight and leave there.

674
01:02:54,574 --> 01:02:58,502
If I know it sounds crazy, but I think it's worth investigating.

675
01:02:58,503 --> 01:03:04,910
Well, investigate that giant woman, but
better be right, it's better.

676
01:03:04,911 --> 01:03:07,451
He's good boss, I'll find her.

677
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:10,439
Hehehe, nothing surprises me.

678
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:11,440
You know, I'll need more money, say 100.

679
01:03:17,049 --> 01:03:21,099
? Hello ?, Hello?

680
01:03:25,274 --> 01:03:25,897
? Hello?

681
01:03:51,629 --> 01:03:52,642
Hello.

682
01:03:52,643 --> 01:03:53,974
? Dr. Lindstrom?

683
01:03:54,421 --> 01:03:56,845
Angel asked me to contact him.

684
01:03:57,622 --> 01:03:59,601
Something happened and needs your help.

685
01:04:00,633 --> 01:04:01,662
What happened?

686
01:04:02,626 --> 01:04:07,944
I do not know how to say esop, but... I grew up a little.

687
01:04:09,247 --> 01:04:10,552
? Where is it?

688
01:04:10,816 --> 01:04:11,553
I'm on Gordon's property.

689
01:04:11,554 --> 01:04:14,561
The Plaything mansion, do you know where it is?

690
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:15,928
Yes.

691
01:04:36,822 --> 01:04:37,584
Betty.

692
01:04:37,585 --> 01:04:39,661
What's going on here Wilson?

693
01:04:39,662 --> 01:04:40,316
What do you mean?

694
01:04:40,317 --> 01:04:42,090
Do not look at me like that.

695
01:04:42,091 --> 01:04:44,157
I am an armored person.

696
01:04:44,158 --> 01:04:45,441
You know that.

697
01:04:45,442 --> 01:04:49,684
I want a direct answer about this contest.

698
01:04:50,467 --> 01:04:51,862
Do you want an answer?

699
01:04:52,404 --> 01:04:53,280
Yes.

700
01:04:54,455 --> 01:04:58,184
Look at the central page, read it and cry.

701
01:05:18,103 --> 01:05:19,604
I will become a millionaire.

702
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:36,308
We could take a pair with you standing up.

703
01:05:41,747 --> 01:05:42,706
? As?

704
01:05:43,822 --> 01:05:45,026
Perfect.

705
01:05:47,454 --> 01:05:50,117
I'm glad you decided to take these pictures.

706
01:05:53,634 --> 01:05:55,166
I trust in you Mark.

707
01:05:56,599 --> 01:05:59,167
Yes, of course, could you move a little to your left ?, please.

708
01:05:59,168 --> 01:06:00,923
On the right, yes same.

709
01:06:00,924 --> 01:06:02,391
Great.

710
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:04,372
As same.

711
01:06:16,756 --> 01:06:17,642
Good.

712
01:06:30,224 --> 01:06:32,596
This is great.

713
01:06:32,597 --> 01:06:34,396
Great, yes, same.

714
01:06:35,202 --> 01:06:36,265
Stay like that.

715
01:06:37,292 --> 01:06:38,097
Stay like that.

716
01:06:38,808 --> 01:06:39,497
Good.

717
01:06:40,229 --> 01:06:41,296
One more, one more.

718
01:06:45,859 --> 01:06:48,055
Upss, forgive n.

719
01:06:48,412 --> 01:06:49,244
Perd n.

720
01:06:50,612 --> 01:06:52,041
It's fine, it was hot.

721
01:06:53,048 --> 01:06:54,439
Come on.

722
01:06:55,245 --> 01:06:56,114
Here we go.

723
01:06:57,661 --> 01:06:58,727
Good, good.

724
01:06:59,731 --> 01:07:00,327
Great.

725
01:07:00,566 --> 01:07:01,376
As ي.

726
01:07:01,377 --> 01:07:03,831
Put them together, well, well.

727
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:04,832
It looks good.

728
01:07:04,833 --> 01:07:09,283
Good, move to the right now.
Good good good.

729
01:07:11,739 --> 01:07:14,654
Come on, smile, smile, come on baby.

730
01:07:16,998 --> 01:07:18,307
Likewise, it looks tight.

731
01:07:18,308 --> 01:07:20,242
Yes, Good, good.

732
01:07:20,604 --> 01:07:24,581
If you have it, like that, well.

733
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:25,964
Good, one more, one more.

734
01:07:25,965 --> 01:07:26,867
Here we go.

735
01:07:27,595 --> 01:07:28,255
Stay like that.

736
01:07:34,902 --> 01:07:37,313
I'm telling you, Angel somehow arranged it.

737
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:41,579
How would she want to have 150 meters to be the model of a or?

738
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:42,865
Yes, definitely.

739
01:07:43,136 --> 01:07:45,387
Nobody wants to win so much.

740
01:07:46,966 --> 01:07:50,762
She jokes what she wants, but that does not change that she arranged it.

741
01:07:50,763 --> 01:07:53,167
Have you seen the size of her breasts?

742
01:07:53,168 --> 01:07:55,062
How could I not?

743
01:07:55,826 --> 01:07:58,353
Betty, calm down, it's just a contest.

744
01:07:58,354 --> 01:08:01,979
Be the Plaything of the year, it is not just a contest.

745
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:03,984
I have worked all my life for this.

746
01:08:03,985 --> 01:08:04,985
And now Angel grows a few meters and is selected over me.

747
01:08:10,377 --> 01:08:12,158
How would it have happened anyway?

748
01:08:12,939 --> 01:08:14,147
We should find out.

749
01:08:14,418 --> 01:08:15,327
? How should we?

750
01:08:16,398 --> 01:08:18,470
Well, he cheated us both.

751
01:08:19,823 --> 01:08:21,357
You must do something.

752
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:22,992
Come on.

753
01:08:22,993 --> 01:08:24,421
You cover the sun.

754
01:08:24,805 --> 01:08:26,676
Good.

755
01:09:42,202 --> 01:09:43,165
Hello Angel.

756
01:09:44,530 --> 01:09:47,072
She looks pretty today.

757
01:09:47,073 --> 01:09:48,725
Pretty as a photo.

758
01:09:49,963 --> 01:09:52,440
Where is Mark?

759
01:09:52,969 --> 01:09:56,081
Well he's...
- I'm here.

760
01:09:56,806 --> 01:09:58,459
I will give you the pictures of money.

761
01:10:03,257 --> 01:10:04,437
? How are you?

762
01:10:05,703 --> 01:10:06,973
Good, I think.

763
01:10:07,381 --> 01:10:10,281
I am anxious because these specialists arrive.

764
01:10:10,282 --> 01:10:12,545
Yes, I can not imagine that it takes so long.

765
01:10:13,266 --> 01:10:17,334
I want them to arrive soon, I want to be normal again.

766
01:10:17,335 --> 01:10:18,665
I'm sure I know.

767
01:10:19,231 --> 01:10:22,109
If someone can help you with Bob's specialists.

768
01:10:22,110 --> 01:10:23,426
I hope you're right.

769
01:10:24,165 --> 01:10:26,544
I would hate it to be another lie.

770
01:10:27,117 --> 01:10:29,090
Ha, another lie.

771
01:10:29,989 --> 01:10:31,750
Those specialists do not exist.

772
01:10:32,373 --> 01:10:33,807
? Or are there?

773
01:10:36,947 --> 01:10:38,491
Betty, where are you?

774
01:10:49,684 --> 01:10:51,073
Betty, are you here?

775
01:11:12,025 --> 01:11:14,195
Sure, there are specialists, Angel.

776
01:11:14,196 --> 01:11:16,594
You do not know what you're talking about

777
01:11:16,595 --> 01:11:18,862
She knows exactly what she is talking about.

778
01:11:18,863 --> 01:11:20,955
Hey, what side are you on?

779
01:11:21,442 --> 01:11:23,097
I'm on the side of her.

780
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:27,138
Angel, there were never any specialists, they lied to you all the time.

781
01:11:27,139 --> 01:11:29,169
And do not bother to say goodbye.

782
01:11:29,491 --> 01:11:30,496
I resign.

783
01:11:32,074 --> 01:11:35,619
M-look, Angel, Bob and I, we only care about you.

784
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:38,697
We always wanted to do the best for you, dear.

785
01:11:39,267 --> 01:11:41,161
How could you do this to me?

786
01:11:41,919 --> 01:11:43,933
You will be famous.

787
01:11:43,934 --> 01:11:46,264
? How?, A phenomenon.

788
01:11:46,265 --> 01:11:48,319
An act of circus.

789
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,421
No, no, you will be...

790
01:11:50,699 --> 01:11:52,301
Bigger than Elvis.

791
01:11:52,302 --> 01:11:53,331
Do not listen to them.

792
01:11:53,332 --> 01:11:57,040
Look around you, there are many beautiful people.

793
01:11:57,638 --> 01:12:02,440
But t, you're unique.

794
01:12:02,441 --> 01:12:03,915
Do not bet.

795
01:12:03,915 --> 01:12:07,371
I thought you would go out with yours, cheating, right?

796
01:12:07,763 --> 01:12:09,465
Well, think again.

797
01:12:17,097 --> 01:12:17,757
No.

798
01:12:19,481 --> 01:12:22,207
You can not, I will win this contest.

799
01:12:34,118 --> 01:12:36,023
This can not be happening.

800
01:12:44,428 --> 01:12:46,105
Are you Dr. Lindstrom?
- Yes.

801
01:12:46,106 --> 01:12:48,477
There is no time to lose, help me with this.

802
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:50,992
? This will make it normal again?
- Yes.

803
01:12:50,993 --> 01:12:54,708
The tranquilizer will make them slower, enough to apply the cure.
Come on.

804
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:14,709
Baby, this month I can pay the rent.

805
01:13:23,537 --> 01:13:26,536
Angel, it's me, Dr. Lindstrom.

806
01:13:26,834 --> 01:13:28,329
I have a cure.

807
01:13:28,917 --> 01:13:30,785
Dr. Lindstrom, help me.

808
01:13:31,742 --> 01:13:33,818
We will make them normal again.

809
01:13:33,819 --> 01:13:34,614
Help me.

810
01:13:47,733 --> 01:13:49,251
You are not stopping them.

811
01:13:49,252 --> 01:13:50,916
It is not stopping.

812
01:13:50,917 --> 01:13:52,405
I better go.

813
01:13:59,293 --> 01:14:00,731
Hello.

814
01:14:02,359 --> 01:14:03,702
God, I mat.

815
01:14:03,829 --> 01:14:05,546
No, it's just a tranquilizer.

816
01:14:13,373 --> 01:14:14,634
Come on, returned to my car.

817
01:14:18,747 --> 01:14:20,315
? Is it okay?

818
01:14:21,348 --> 01:14:22,659
Mr. Gordon.

819
01:14:27,112 --> 01:14:28,264
No, no.

820
01:14:28,759 --> 01:14:30,564
This seems painful.

821
01:14:30,959 --> 01:14:31,565
Stamina

822
01:14:37,786 --> 01:14:40,297
Sorry, I could not warn you about Betty.

823
01:14:42,721 --> 01:14:43,940
? Where were they?

824
01:14:43,941 --> 01:14:45,357
I do not know.

825
01:14:45,668 --> 01:14:46,597
Can you walk?

826
01:14:47,027 --> 01:14:48,787
I will return it to the house.

827
01:15:11,975 --> 01:15:12,897
Vac ي o.

828
01:15:16,589 --> 01:15:18,579
This is not a good se al.

831
01:15:40,648 --> 01:15:42,133
Save who can.

832
01:16:15,036 --> 01:16:18,673
Two giant women, we need reinforcements, immediately.

833
01:16:22,674 --> 01:16:23,307
No.

834
01:16:25,354 --> 01:16:28,820
I do not know how big they are, they are giants.

835
01:16:29,748 --> 01:16:30,349
Hello.

836
01:16:31,372 --> 01:16:32,058
Hello.

837
01:16:32,059 --> 01:16:34,966
Well, we have a problem, I do not think they believed me.

838
01:16:38,825 --> 01:16:43,024
Demons, we need reinforcements, who is with me ?.

839
01:16:58,695 --> 01:17:01,494
Oh, God, look at the size of those girls.

840
01:18:10,881 --> 01:18:13,768
Excuse me, have you seen two giant women?

841
01:18:13,769 --> 01:18:15,196
See them, I do not even know them.

842
01:18:15,197 --> 01:18:16,432
Why do you run?

843
01:18:16,433 --> 01:18:17,961
Everyone does it.

844
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:35,094
You pray, you pray, stop this fight, immediately.

845
01:18:39,458 --> 01:18:40,794
Let them have it.

846
01:18:59,303 --> 01:19:00,686
Yes, come on.

847
01:19:03,842 --> 01:19:05,229
I am normal again.

848
01:19:16,058 --> 01:19:18,449
Betty, are you okay?

849
01:19:22,144 --> 01:19:23,462
You will be fine.

850
01:19:25,682 --> 01:19:26,444
? Angel?

851
01:19:26,810 --> 01:19:27,701
? Is it okay?

852
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:30,392
Sorry.
- ?What?

853
01:19:30,706 --> 01:19:31,901
Not this time partner.

854
01:19:38,249 --> 01:19:42,337
Hey, Mark, you win something, you lose something, partner.

855
01:19:47,757 --> 01:19:50,521
Well, let's go, let the police come back.

856
01:19:51,509 --> 01:19:52,681
Come on, go away.

857
01:19:52,682 --> 01:19:53,577
Long here.

858
01:19:55,571 --> 01:19:57,625
I have Betty.

859
01:19:58,377 --> 01:19:59,719
Are you a baby?

860
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:01,619
Long here.

861
01:20:26,674 --> 01:20:28,149
What time will you come?

862
01:20:28,150 --> 01:20:29,508
How to at 7.

863
01:20:30,037 --> 01:20:31,698
Do you need something more to drink?

864
01:20:31,699 --> 01:20:32,760
Yes.

865
01:20:36,121 --> 01:20:37,648
He does it, right?
- Yes.

866
01:20:41,813 --> 01:20:42,511
Hello.

867
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:50,524
Can you believe this?

868
01:20:50,874 --> 01:20:52,686
They must believe that we are crazy.
