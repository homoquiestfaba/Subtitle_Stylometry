1
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:01,620
I don't see her.

2
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:02,703
The shift changes.

3
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:04,708
Just give it a
couple of minutes.

4
00:02:07,964 --> 00:02:09,694
You guys sure about this?

5
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,860
Yeah yeah, works all the time.

6
00:02:11,902 --> 00:02:15,167
Besides, this
lady loves Lynch.

7
00:02:15,205 --> 00:02:17,503
- Loves him.
- I'm cute.

8
00:02:26,616 --> 00:02:28,777
Is that...
is that her?

9
00:02:29,986 --> 00:02:31,986
Shit.

10
00:02:40,664 --> 00:02:44,031
Parker, what you could do...

11
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:47,388
is go down there and
look beautiful...

12
00:02:47,393 --> 00:02:48,300
and smile.

13
00:02:48,305 --> 00:02:50,933
- What? Me?
- Yeah.

14
00:02:50,974 --> 00:02:52,337
Uh, no.

15
00:02:52,342 --> 00:02:55,470
No no, this is your thing.

16
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,448
All you have to do is go
over there and say, like,

17
00:02:59,482 --> 00:03:01,950
'Hey, me and my friends...'

18
00:03:01,985 --> 00:03:04,078
Girlfriends.
Say girlfriends.

19
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,152
'Me and my girlfriends totally
forgot our credit cards...

20
00:03:07,157 --> 00:03:08,754
so we can't get
our lift tickets...

21
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:09,487
from over there.

22
00:03:09,492 --> 00:03:11,397
- So can you,
like, help us out?'

23
00:03:11,402 --> 00:03:12,324
That is so lame.

24
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:13,925
- Give me my money back.
- Your money.

25
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,428
- It's not gonna work.
- Take this. Start at 50.

26
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:18,296
That's what the other
lady usually takes.

27
00:03:18,301 --> 00:03:19,130
And just, you know,

28
00:03:19,135 --> 00:03:20,532
work your way up
if you need to.

29
00:03:20,537 --> 00:03:23,165
- Dan...
- Hey, look at me. Look at me.

30
00:03:23,206 --> 00:03:26,004
You're gonna be fine.
You'll be great.

31
00:03:26,042 --> 00:03:28,042
Parker, you've so got this.

32
00:03:28,044 --> 00:03:31,241
Yeah, and what's the worst
that can happen?

33
00:03:31,281 --> 00:03:33,044
The guy says no.

34
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:36,815
And he's not gonna say no.
No one's ever said no.

35
00:03:36,853 --> 00:03:38,912
Dan, you do it.
I feel stupid.

36
00:03:38,955 --> 00:03:39,859
Relax, okay?

37
00:03:39,864 --> 00:03:42,356
I promise, you're
gonna be great.

38
00:03:42,392 --> 00:03:45,520
- Why me?
- That's 'cause you're a girl.

39
00:03:45,562 --> 00:03:49,020
A beautiful...
hey, you're a beautiful girl.

40
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,600
And you have a charming smile.

41
00:03:56,906 --> 00:03:58,906
Just...

42
00:03:59,876 --> 00:04:01,876
just...

43
00:04:02,746 --> 00:04:04,746
There we go.

44
00:04:08,652 --> 00:04:11,212
That's great.
Go get him.

45
00:04:13,023 --> 00:04:14,919
- Get in the game.
- Okay.

46
00:04:14,924 --> 00:04:16,949
Come on.

47
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:20,882
Attention all skiers.

48
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:22,494
The Black Dog
Trail is now open.

49
00:04:22,499 --> 00:04:24,831
Sorry for the inconvenience.

50
00:04:31,874 --> 00:04:33,874
Hey.

51
00:04:35,177 --> 00:04:37,873
Can I bum a smoke?

52
00:04:55,197 --> 00:04:58,724
- I'm Parker.
- Jason.

53
00:04:58,767 --> 00:05:01,065
Oh cool.
My brother's name is Jason.

54
00:05:01,103 --> 00:05:03,162
That's awesome.

55
00:05:03,205 --> 00:05:07,232
Yeah, so I don't want to waste
your time or anything...

56
00:05:07,276 --> 00:05:08,663
because you seem like...

57
00:05:08,668 --> 00:05:10,607
a wicked busy guy
and everything.

58
00:05:10,612 --> 00:05:13,513
This is gonna sound
really stupid.

59
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:16,177
It's just that my
girlfriends and I...

60
00:05:16,218 --> 00:05:18,215
came all the way up
from Salem State.

61
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,285
I was kind of the dumbass
who said that I could pay...

62
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,253
for all three of the tickets
on my mom's credit card.

63
00:05:23,258 --> 00:05:25,627
And then I left
her credit card...

64
00:05:25,632 --> 00:05:26,990
at the gas station.

65
00:05:26,995 --> 00:05:29,122
- Right.
- No, I mean...

66
00:05:29,164 --> 00:05:30,961
I totally have money.

67
00:05:30,966 --> 00:05:33,097
Just not enough for all three,
you know?

68
00:05:33,102 --> 00:05:35,536
- How much?
- 50?

69
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,839
I could lose my job.

70
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:41,605
No no, he's not going for it.

71
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,704
Yes he will.
Just shut up, please.

72
00:05:44,747 --> 00:05:47,875
I mean he's either
gonna do that job for...

73
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,580
what do you call it, minimal?

74
00:05:49,585 --> 00:05:51,081
- Minimum.
- Minimum wage,

75
00:05:51,086 --> 00:05:53,135
or he's gonna do it
for minimum wage...

76
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,084
plus a little bit.

77
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:56,216
I mean, I know what I'd do.

78
00:06:00,929 --> 00:06:03,329
She just had to come
skiing today, huh?

79
00:06:05,768 --> 00:06:07,431
You said you wouldn't mind.

80
00:06:07,436 --> 00:06:09,956
I don't. I don't mind.
I don't mind at all.

81
00:06:11,206 --> 00:06:12,976
I'm just saying we
haven't seen you...

82
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:14,471
at Fezzywigs for
a $1 pitcher...

83
00:06:14,476 --> 00:06:15,878
since last semester
and you don't...

84
00:06:15,883 --> 00:06:17,207
show up for Monday
Night Football.

85
00:06:17,212 --> 00:06:19,476
I watched football
at your house last week.

86
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:21,380
Dan, 10 minutes.
Football games...

87
00:06:21,385 --> 00:06:22,780
are more than 10 minutes.

88
00:06:22,785 --> 00:06:24,150
They're like lots
of 10 minuteses,

89
00:06:24,155 --> 00:06:24,515
you know?

90
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,216
I have a girlfriend now.

91
00:06:26,221 --> 00:06:28,452
I don't know what you want
me to do about it.

92
00:06:28,457 --> 00:06:30,053
- I'm sorry.
- You know what? It's fine.

93
00:06:30,058 --> 00:06:31,671
I'm... I'm just
just saying that

94
00:06:31,676 --> 00:06:33,490
Mt. Holliston was
kind of our thing.

95
00:06:33,495 --> 00:06:35,692
And she can't even ride
so it's a little weird.

96
00:06:35,697 --> 00:06:38,325
- She's getting better.
- Yeah yeah.

97
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:40,699
Now I feel like a dick.

98
00:06:40,736 --> 00:06:42,226
I mean, if you had
a problem with this,

99
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:43,300
you've got to say something.

100
00:06:43,305 --> 00:06:46,763
No no, it's not a problem.
Just forget I said anything.

101
00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:48,405
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,935
Attention all skiers.

103
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:53,243
Mt. Holliston will be open
next Friday through Sunday.

104
00:06:53,248 --> 00:06:55,978
Get your tickets now
to avoid waiting in line.

105
00:07:09,498 --> 00:07:11,796
Okay.

106
00:07:13,902 --> 00:07:16,567
I think you did great.
I'm proud of you, Parker.

107
00:07:16,572 --> 00:07:19,735
- I did good, right?
- You did well.

108
00:07:22,177 --> 00:07:24,177
So where's my change?

109
00:07:24,179 --> 00:07:26,179
Um, there isn't any.

110
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:28,181
You just gave
him the full 100?

111
00:07:28,185 --> 00:07:30,585
Well, yeah.
He wasn't gonna do it for 50.

112
00:07:30,619 --> 00:07:32,484
Okay, so what happened to...

113
00:07:32,489 --> 00:07:34,555
the numbers
between 50 and 100?

114
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,520
Like, say, 51...

115
00:07:36,525 --> 00:07:38,584
or 75 even?

116
00:07:38,627 --> 00:07:39,974
Dan, you gave me two 50s.

117
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:41,758
Was I supposed to
ask for change?

118
00:07:41,763 --> 00:07:44,231
I would have asked for change.

119
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:46,151
I mean, it's still way cheaper...

120
00:07:46,156 --> 00:07:48,156
than paying for
tickets, right?

121
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,870
I definitely would have
asked for change.

122
00:07:52,608 --> 00:07:54,608
Hey.

123
00:07:57,913 --> 00:07:59,776
Girlfriends?

124
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:01,781
What's up?

125
00:08:08,624 --> 00:08:10,074
Look at these chumps paying...

126
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,722
top dollar for
their lift tickets.

127
00:08:11,727 --> 00:08:14,059
- Whoo-hoo!
- Not us, though.

128
00:08:14,096 --> 00:08:16,394
Thanks to you, babe.

129
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:20,094
Oh, now I'm babe.

130
00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:22,467
You never call me pet names.

131
00:08:22,504 --> 00:08:25,405
- I'm not a pet name guy.
- Hmm.

132
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,238
He calls me Parker.

133
00:08:28,277 --> 00:08:31,075
- That's your name.
- I know.

134
00:08:31,113 --> 00:08:32,072
But you're supposed to...

135
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:33,343
call me something
affectionate...

136
00:08:33,348 --> 00:08:35,578
like honey or sweetie.

137
00:08:35,617 --> 00:08:37,915
You know, I hooked up
with a girl last semester...

138
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,860
that called me my
last name in bed.

139
00:08:39,865 --> 00:08:40,584
It was weird.

140
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:43,717
She was all like, 'Oh, Lynch,
your hair's so soft.

141
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:44,806
Do me harder, Lynch.'

142
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:46,857
It was like throwing
it to Dan over here.

143
00:08:46,862 --> 00:08:48,862
Yeah, I could call you O'Neil.

144
00:08:50,365 --> 00:08:53,892
You don't touch
my face enough either.

145
00:08:53,936 --> 00:08:55,699
Third wheel.

146
00:08:55,704 --> 00:08:57,968
- Watch it, Lynch.
- Hey, I'm not dating you.

147
00:08:57,973 --> 00:09:00,003
You don't get to
make my life suck.

148
00:09:00,008 --> 00:09:02,306
- Whoa! No no no.
- Whoa.

149
00:09:02,344 --> 00:09:04,041
No one ever said anything...

150
00:09:04,046 --> 00:09:06,344
about you making my life suck.

151
00:09:06,381 --> 00:09:08,381
- Uh-huh.
- Sweetie.

152
00:09:09,384 --> 00:09:11,477
Aw.

153
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:16,385
So Dan tells me you're getting
a little better on that board.

154
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,120
Well, I don't know about that.

155
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,787
Last time I did pretty
good, didn't I?

156
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:23,456
Yeah.
Yeah, you're getting better.

157
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:25,227
You fall on your
ass snowboarding.

158
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,862
The first few times
you fall on your ass.

159
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:29,567
After that it's easy.
It's like riding a bike.

160
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,193
Just tell me, when
are you gonna...

161
00:09:35,198 --> 00:09:36,872
get rid of those goddamn skis?

162
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:38,708
- Come on.
- What?

163
00:09:38,713 --> 00:09:42,376
I mean, snowboards are just
too emo for me.

164
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,476
Those things are a fad.
In 10 years they'll be gone.

165
00:09:45,486 --> 00:09:47,886
Yeah, that's what
they said about rap.

166
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:49,947
That's true.

167
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,491
Can you guys smell
that fresh mountain air?

168
00:09:55,496 --> 00:09:57,691
It smells a bit like...

169
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:01,066
cancer.

170
00:10:02,503 --> 00:10:05,301
You know what?
I am so sick of potheads...

171
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:06,936
giving me shit
about smoking butts.

172
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:09,627
- At least pot does
something for you.

173
00:10:09,632 --> 00:10:09,872
Oh.

174
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:11,136
Yes, cigarettes
are just gross,

175
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:12,074
especially in the cold.

176
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,876
They stick to you.
You smell like...

177
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:16,679
an ashtray,
an old man's used floss.

178
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:18,614
Old man's... where
the hell do you...

179
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:19,849
come up with this stuff?

180
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:22,379
Okay, have you ever
smelled your floss?

181
00:10:22,423 --> 00:10:24,891
No, I have never
smelled my own floss.

182
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:25,934
- Never. Not once.

183
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:27,623
Well, it's nasty. It is nasty.

184
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:30,654
- Why am I friends with you?
- I don't know.

185
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:33,064
Here, give me a drag.

186
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:37,266
Do you guys know
when we're gonna get back?

187
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:40,832
'Cause I've got like two weeks
worth of chapters to read.

188
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,638
Oh come on.
She broke the first rule.

189
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:45,209
- Parker, you broke
the first rule.

190
00:10:45,214 --> 00:10:45,608
What?

191
00:10:45,613 --> 00:10:46,766
You can't talk about
real life shit...

192
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:47,376
while we're up here.

193
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:48,986
The whole point of being here...

194
00:10:48,991 --> 00:10:50,646
is to forget about
all that shit,

195
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,114
- relax, enjoy ourselves.
- Okay.

196
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,549
Deal with that shit
when you get home.

197
00:10:53,554 --> 00:10:56,523
Okay, but I've got...

198
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:07,528
Okay, what asshole couldn't
get on the chair right?

199
00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:09,798
- What the hell, right?
- Dude.

200
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:12,567
Oh, that's good.
Yell more.

201
00:11:15,076 --> 00:11:17,076
- Hello!
- Having fun up there?

202
00:11:17,078 --> 00:11:19,273
Parker, it's okay.

203
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:21,804
Is someone afraid of heights?

204
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,874
- No.
- No?

205
00:11:23,918 --> 00:11:27,615
So it doesn't bother you
when I do this?

206
00:11:27,655 --> 00:11:30,317
- Quit it!
- Don't be an asshole.

207
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,821
Stop.

208
00:11:31,826 --> 00:11:33,255
Sorry.

209
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,888
Honey, crazy thing.

210
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,728
Only one of these things
has ever fallen off...

211
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:41,428
a chairlift thing before.

212
00:11:41,469 --> 00:11:44,927
Okay,
points for calling me honey.

213
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:47,440
But you just made
that statistic up.

214
00:11:47,475 --> 00:11:50,016
Yeah, and statistics
don't work...

215
00:11:50,021 --> 00:11:52,021
on smokers.

216
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:54,677
Come on, man.
We paid good money to ride.

217
00:11:54,682 --> 00:11:56,741
Let's go!

218
00:11:56,784 --> 00:11:59,412
Actually, I paid good money.

219
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:01,163
Actually, I'm
gonna pay you back,

220
00:12:01,168 --> 00:12:02,618
so it's like the same thing.

221
00:12:02,623 --> 00:12:05,023
- Okay.
- Okay.

222
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:07,527
What, do you want it now?

223
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:10,029
All right, that's what
I'm talking about.

224
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:12,931
Whoo!
You guys ready?

225
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:19,738
- Why do I have
to wear a helmet?

226
00:12:19,743 --> 00:12:20,503
Safety first.

227
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:22,669
But you guys aren't
wearing helmets.

228
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,640
Only kids wear helmets.

229
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:27,049
That's 'cause they're
still learning,

230
00:12:27,054 --> 00:12:27,676
like you.

231
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:29,327
Here, I'm not
arguing about this.

232
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:30,379
Just put it on. Here.

233
00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:32,081
No, Dan, I don't want...

234
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:34,304
Look, even the pro
guys wear helmets.

235
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:36,309
Nobody makes fun of them.

236
00:12:36,657 --> 00:12:38,682
Aw.

237
00:12:38,726 --> 00:12:40,823
You guys are just doing this
to make fun of me.

238
00:12:40,828 --> 00:12:42,158
No, huh-uh.

239
00:12:42,163 --> 00:12:44,996
Oh yeah, sure.

240
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:48,627
No, I think chicks
in helmets are hot.

241
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:51,331
- Right?
- Yeah.

242
00:12:54,742 --> 00:12:57,677
- Need a little help?
- You think?

243
00:12:57,711 --> 00:12:59,842
Yeah, looks like your bindings
are a little loose.

244
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:01,974
come on, I'll get you up.
come on.

245
00:13:02,016 --> 00:13:02,482
There you go.

246
00:13:02,487 --> 00:13:03,746
I'll just tighten
these up for you.

247
00:13:03,751 --> 00:13:06,242
- Thanks.
- No problem.

248
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:08,380
Aw.

249
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:10,286
Look at Lynch.

250
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,192
Yeah, look at him.
He's a chick magnet.

251
00:13:14,428 --> 00:13:17,522
- These all right?
- Yeah, that's a lot better.

252
00:13:17,565 --> 00:13:19,342
- What the hell
are you doing, man?

253
00:13:19,347 --> 00:13:20,362
What's your problem?

254
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:21,931
- I'm trying to help her.
- Ryan!

255
00:13:21,936 --> 00:13:23,533
- He had his hands
all over you.

256
00:13:23,538 --> 00:13:25,534
No he didn't. I can
take care of myself.

257
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:28,565
Just go, okay?
I'll be there in a second.

258
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:33,790
I am so sorry about that.

259
00:13:33,795 --> 00:13:35,778
He can be such an
asshole sometimes.

260
00:13:35,783 --> 00:13:38,081
I was seriously just
trying to help.

261
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:40,401
I mean, I don't know
if I can compete...

262
00:13:40,406 --> 00:13:42,406
with a catch like that.

263
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:46,055
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

264
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,060
Well, thank you for your help.

265
00:13:48,062 --> 00:13:50,292
I'm really sorry about that.

266
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:52,261
- I'm Shannon, by the way.
- Joe.

267
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:54,266
Shannon, come on.

268
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:57,634
Well, it was really
nice to meet you.

269
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,538
- Yeah, you too.
- I've got to go.

270
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:03,440
- Good luck with that.
- Yeah.

271
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,411
I was like a second away
from kicking that guy's ass.

272
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,044
Yeah, I know you were, Lynch.

273
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:15,250
Don't worry about it.
He's a douchebag.

274
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:17,553
Seriously, that guy
was such a dick.

275
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,645
Why don't we talk
about how tough...

276
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,650
you guys are at the bottom?

277
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:27,058
I'm tough.

278
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,796
I know you are, baby.

279
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,801
Come here.

280
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,602
Whoo!

281
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:44,498
¶ How can you say
there are no answers...

282
00:14:44,503 --> 00:14:46,180
to my questions? ¶...

283
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:51,122
¶ You just called once
to let it go ¶...

284
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:53,549
¶ How can you say that none...

285
00:14:53,554 --> 00:14:56,026
of this is really
worth it ¶...

286
00:14:56,062 --> 00:15:00,362
¶ When we've already won? ¶...

287
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:05,770
¶ When we've already won. ¶

288
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:15,146
What?

289
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,527
Oh, she told you that?

290
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,298
Yeah, we'll go to
Okemo, Killington.

291
00:15:34,303 --> 00:15:35,430
We'll just go up north.

292
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,332
- We'll get away for a while.
- Let's do it.

293
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:39,396
- Christmas, you and me.
- Deal.

294
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,374
Listen, it's not
like out West where,

295
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:43,104
you know, it's
like a commercial.

296
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,632
You've got to ride
three lifts to get to...

297
00:15:44,637 --> 00:15:45,840
the top, it's like
perfect powder.

298
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:47,375
Let's be honest,
it's not gonna be like that.

299
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,678
Yeah, well, speaking
of good skiing,

300
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:52,514
riding the bunny hill
has been fun all day,

301
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,857
but, you know, I think
I'd like to do...

302
00:15:54,862 --> 00:15:57,142
an actual run before
we leave tonight.

303
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:59,601
Look, if you want to
go off on your own,

304
00:15:59,606 --> 00:16:01,122
you don't have to hang
out with us all day.

305
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,648
No no, it's fine.
I'm just saying

306
00:16:02,653 --> 00:16:04,359
I'd like to step it
up at some point.

307
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:05,703
You know, it's been
amazing watching

308
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:06,861
Parker fall on
her ass all day,

309
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:09,266
but, you know,
it'd be cool to...

310
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,032
do some real skiing.

311
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:15,404
I think I've had enough
skiing for today anyway.

312
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,238
So I can just stay
here at the lodge...

313
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:19,711
if you guys want to do more.

314
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:22,076
I didn't mean that.
I didn't mean it like that.

315
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,945
That's not what I meant.
I don't know what I meant.

316
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,714
I told you I didn't...
I didn't have to come.

317
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:29,586
No no no, Parker,
I didn't not want you to come.

318
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:30,915
No, he was the one
who suggested...

319
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,953
you come in the first place.

320
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,017
Okay okay.

321
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,621
The last thing I want
to do is intrude on guy time.

322
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,790
I will not be offended.

323
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,829
I have a lot of
things I can do here.

324
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,756
Actually, why don't
you give me the key...

325
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:45,133
and I'll go check my messages?

326
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,068
Not to the locker, no.
You're gonna...

327
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:49,070
come sit down for a second.
Come here.

328
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:50,552
All you're gonna
get is a bunch...

329
00:16:50,557 --> 00:16:51,773
of messages from your mom...

330
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:54,275
complaining about this,
complaining about that.

331
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,714
No, I'm not gonna
give you the key.

332
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,378
I'm sorry if I ruined
skiing for you today.

333
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,911
You didn't.
Honestly, you didn't at all.

334
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,480
You missed the whole part of...

335
00:17:04,485 --> 00:17:06,454
the conversation before
you walked up...

336
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,731
where I was
saying, like, um...

337
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,091
what was I saying?

338
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:10,774
I was saying, like,

339
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,959
'Dude, this has
been really cool.

340
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,728
I'm glad that we sort of had
this chance...

341
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,235
to bond as a threesome.'

342
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,797
What?

343
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,805
No, I mean, I've seen you
fall a couple times today.

344
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,441
But Dan, I mean, I think...

345
00:17:25,446 --> 00:17:27,446
it took him maybe
three months...

346
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,915
before he could even
stand on that...

347
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,511
thing without looking
like a total idiot.

348
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:33,076
No offense, buddy.
Just the truth.

349
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,280
Joe.

350
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:38,256
I will catch up with you guys.

351
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,782
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

352
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,988
I just... I wanted
to apologize again.

353
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:46,961
Yeah, it's no big deal.

354
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,563
He's just lucky
he didn't make me mad.

355
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,131
I only look half your
boyfriend's size.

356
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:52,263
Ex. He's my ex-boyfriend.

357
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:54,044
We're, you know, trying to...

358
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:56,003
still be friends
and everything.

359
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,146
But as you can see,

360
00:17:57,151 --> 00:17:59,007
it's not really
gonna work out.

361
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:00,641
No way.

362
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:03,077
A group of us all agreed
to go skiing this weekend.

363
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,652
Well, whatever. It's
this whole story...

364
00:18:04,657 --> 00:18:05,913
and I don't want
to hold you up.

365
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,445
But that was just
really embarrassing...

366
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,085
and I just wanted
to say sorry.

367
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,090
That's no problem.

368
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,690
Um, are you gonna be here
next weekend?

369
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,259
Yeah yeah, probably.

370
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,987
My roommate and I
come up like every

371
00:18:19,992 --> 00:18:21,762
Sunday, so maybe
I'll see you around.

372
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,895
That would be a nice time.

373
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28,566
- Okay.
- I guess I'll see you then.

374
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:31,133
- Great. Good night.
- Good night.

375
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,511
Come on.
You know what?

376
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,007
Can I just get your
number so I know...

377
00:18:38,012 --> 00:18:38,946
how to catch up with you?

378
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,748
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

379
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:42,187
Shit, I don't
ski with a phone.

380
00:18:42,192 --> 00:18:42,884
You have a pen?

381
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:45,153
I don't ski with a pen.
Sorry.

382
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:47,121
All right, you know what?
Just shoot.

383
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,523
I've got a pretty good memory.

384
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:50,668
I've only smoked pot
like 500 times...

385
00:18:50,673 --> 00:18:52,673
so I'm good.

386
00:18:53,321 --> 00:18:54,961
How can they afford
to close early?

387
00:18:54,966 --> 00:18:56,930
You're only open three days
out of the week, man.

388
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,298
Why don't you write a letter?

389
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,799
Why don't you give me
my money back?

390
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:01,268
What money?

391
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,764
We're only had,
like, four runs.

392
00:19:03,808 --> 00:19:05,413
- Can you give us
a break, please?

393
00:19:05,418 --> 00:19:05,605
830.

394
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,274
- What?
- Just remember 830.

395
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,747
- Just one more time, please?
- Sorry.

396
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:12,750
I'd give you more money
but I gave it all to you.

397
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,714
Hey, you got a pen?

398
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:17,584
It's not about the money.
We got weather coming in.

399
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:18,946
We're trying to
Clear the mountain.

400
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:19,920
There's nothing I can do.

401
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,048
Okay, what if we
run straight down?

402
00:19:22,053 --> 00:19:24,053
Like the quickest run ever?

403
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,855
We'll be, like, wicked fast.

404
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:30,459
We gave you 100 bucks.

405
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,970
Come on.

406
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,575
Please?

407
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,073
- Hurry.
- Like I said, wicked fast.

408
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:46,709
- Like the wind.
- 7860.

409
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,575
Seriously, for 100
bucks you'd figure...

410
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,761
the guy would cut
us some slack.

411
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:03,296
No shit.

412
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:05,498
I thought they were open
till 10:00 on Sundays.

413
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,233
What ever happened
to night skiing?

414
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:11,204
Wachusett's got night skiing.
Should have gone there.

415
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:13,969
It's kind of like Quash Hill,
just not as lame.

416
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,943
Do you remember
the numbers I told you?

417
00:20:16,948 --> 00:20:19,143
830.

418
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,652
Look at you, Lynch.
You got her number.

419
00:20:21,686 --> 00:20:23,450
What did He-Man
have to say about that?

420
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,785
That guy? Who cares?
Steroids shrink your dick.

421
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,281
Oh shit, what are my numbers?

422
00:20:28,326 --> 00:20:30,419
7860.

423
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:33,090
Parker, will you
remember that, 7860?

424
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,531
Nope.

425
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,695
- Early night, huh?
- Yeah.

426
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,402
Pendergraph wants to see you
in his office.

427
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,337
Something about the schedule
next weekend.

428
00:20:44,342 --> 00:20:45,761
- I'm not working
next weekend.

429
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:47,140
Well, that's what you thought.

430
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:47,904
Come on, Rifkin,

431
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:49,476
it's my brother's
bachelor party.

432
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,211
I put in for it
two months ago.

433
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,810
Go talk to the boss.
He's packing up.

434
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:56,286
I'm the best man.

435
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:58,985
Ready to shut down?

436
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:01,088
There's three more
on the way down.

437
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,093
Wait for them
and it's all set.

438
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,359
I am not waiting
till we get back...

439
00:21:08,364 --> 00:21:09,162
to campus to eat.

440
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,764
I am starving.

441
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,099
Why didn't you just eat
some of that pizza?

442
00:21:13,104 --> 00:21:14,438
Oh, you mean the cardboard...

443
00:21:14,443 --> 00:21:15,869
with tomato sauce
you guys ate?

444
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:18,001
That's not pizza.

445
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,886
That's like rolle
r-skating-rink-...

446
00:21:19,891 --> 00:21:21,207
birthday-party pizza. No.

447
00:21:21,212 --> 00:21:23,084
There's a Papa Gino's
in the way back.

448
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:25,011
It's like 15 minutes
down the mountain.

449
00:21:25,016 --> 00:21:26,746
Sweet.

450
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:29,982
I may eat a whole real pizza
myself, thank you.

451
00:21:31,022 --> 00:21:33,022
Whoa, look at those guys.

452
00:21:33,024 --> 00:21:35,188
We are definitely hitting
that jump this time.

453
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,423
Last run, got to
make it count.

454
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,896
Hey, Sullivan, hey.

455
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:43,858
Hey, man, do me a solid.

456
00:21:43,863 --> 00:21:45,699
I've got to take a piss
so bad I can taste it.

457
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:46,515
- What? What?

458
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,644
I'll just be gone
for two minutes.

459
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:53,010
Asshole.

460
00:21:58,616 --> 00:22:02,108
- Jesus.
- It's just the wind, Parker.

461
00:22:02,153 --> 00:22:05,054
Don't you mean baby?

462
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,576
Last chair is through.

463
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:28,578
All set down here.

464
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,639
Let's go home.

465
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,556
Oh, come on.

466
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,004
It's freakin' cold up here!

467
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:56,472
We don't have time for this.
Thank you.

468
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,319
Anyone know any good jokes?

469
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:11,584
Uh...

470
00:23:13,057 --> 00:23:15,455
what did the 14-year-old girl
from New Hampshire...

471
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,323
say to her dad
when she lost her virginity?

472
00:23:17,328 --> 00:23:19,853
Get off me,
you're crushing my Marlboros.

473
00:23:20,865 --> 00:23:22,865
Yup.

474
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:36,142
What do you think the worst
way to die would be?

475
00:23:36,147 --> 00:23:38,614
That's not morbid.

476
00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:41,777
Yeah, seriously,
that's kind of spooky, Dan.

477
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:45,152
See, I think being
eaten by a shark,

478
00:23:45,189 --> 00:23:47,453
that would be the
worst way to go.

479
00:23:47,491 --> 00:23:50,971
Not like one of those surfers
who gets attacked from below.

480
00:23:50,994 --> 00:23:53,292
You know, never
sees it coming.

481
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,629
Like the poster for 'Jaws.'

482
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:58,263
The chick on the 'Jaws'
poster was hot.

483
00:23:58,268 --> 00:23:59,898
She was?

484
00:23:59,903 --> 00:24:03,134
I don't know. She was naked
and naked chicks are hot.

485
00:24:03,173 --> 00:24:07,667
What if you actually saw
the fin coming towards you?

486
00:24:09,346 --> 00:24:11,031
That'd be worse
than being eaten,

487
00:24:11,036 --> 00:24:11,443
I think.

488
00:24:11,448 --> 00:24:13,364
I mean, knowing this
giant animal...

489
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,379
is coming at you...

490
00:24:14,384 --> 00:24:17,046
and it's gonna eat you alive.

491
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,924
Did you ever see the video,
by the way,

492
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:24,024
of that great white
that's jumping out...

493
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,691
of the water and
eating the seal?

494
00:24:25,696 --> 00:24:28,096
Yeah, that's why I
only swim in pools.

495
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:32,297
I think burning would be
the worst way to go.

496
00:24:32,302 --> 00:24:34,668
Well, yes and no.

497
00:24:34,705 --> 00:24:36,037
I mean, most people
die of smoke...

498
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:37,603
inhalation before fire
even touches them.

499
00:24:37,608 --> 00:24:39,872
It's a fact.

500
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:43,243
I remember watching TV
for three days straight...

501
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,510
after 9/11.

502
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:47,558
The footage they
showed of those...

503
00:24:47,563 --> 00:24:49,723
people leaping off
the Trade Center.

504
00:24:51,054 --> 00:24:53,886
Can you imagine how bad
it must have been inside...

505
00:24:53,891 --> 00:24:55,823
to know that jumping
would have...

506
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,828
been the better way out?

507
00:24:59,296 --> 00:25:01,275
Yeah, but they say
that when you jump...

508
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,961
from that height
your heart stops.

509
00:25:02,966 --> 00:25:04,730
You don't feel it
when you hit the ground.

510
00:25:04,735 --> 00:25:07,299
Okay then, Lynch,
what is the worst way to die?

511
00:25:07,304 --> 00:25:09,167
- What?
- Oh no no no.

512
00:25:09,172 --> 00:25:11,381
You have an answer
for everything.

513
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:13,105
What is your biggest fear?

514
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,943
That's easy.
The sarlacc pit.

515
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,512
I'm sorry, the what?

516
00:25:20,517 --> 00:25:22,581
The sarlacc pit
from 'Return of the Jedi.'

517
00:25:22,586 --> 00:25:25,025
Uh, hello. Being
slowly digested...

518
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,318
over 1000 years...

519
00:25:26,323 --> 00:25:29,156
worst death ever.

520
00:25:29,192 --> 00:25:32,423
'Dan, why don't I ever
have a girlfriend?

521
00:25:32,462 --> 00:25:33,859
Why?'

522
00:25:33,864 --> 00:25:36,424
Hey, shut up.

523
00:25:41,438 --> 00:25:43,736
Why hasn't the
chair started again?

524
00:25:43,774 --> 00:25:46,072
Just give it a minute.

525
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:48,168
This is nothing, man.

526
00:25:48,211 --> 00:25:50,577
At Stowe last year,
me and Sullet...

527
00:25:50,614 --> 00:25:53,447
were stranded for
like 25 minutes.

528
00:25:53,483 --> 00:25:57,112
This big chick fell at the top
and twisted her leg, you know?

529
00:25:57,154 --> 00:25:58,584
And I was like, fine, people.

530
00:25:58,589 --> 00:26:00,118
Just hoist her
off to the side.

531
00:26:00,123 --> 00:26:02,956
Keep the line moving.
But no, they had to stop,

532
00:26:02,993 --> 00:26:03,981
celebrate it right there.

533
00:26:03,986 --> 00:26:05,290
We all had to stay
on the lift...

534
00:26:05,295 --> 00:26:07,295
and freeze our asses off.

535
00:26:07,297 --> 00:26:09,566
Honestly, by the end
of it I couldn't...

536
00:26:09,571 --> 00:26:11,571
feel my fingers.

537
00:26:12,069 --> 00:26:15,095
What? Come on.

538
00:26:15,138 --> 00:26:16,802
Oh, come on now.

539
00:26:16,807 --> 00:26:18,807
Man, this is so messed up.

540
00:26:20,644 --> 00:26:23,112
- Are you kidding me?
- Dan.

541
00:26:23,146 --> 00:26:25,664
I kind of just shat my
pants a little bit.

542
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:27,669
I'm not gonna lie.

543
00:26:28,752 --> 00:26:30,649
Hey!

544
00:26:30,654 --> 00:26:32,781
Turn the goddamn lights on!

545
00:26:35,592 --> 00:26:37,317
They forgot that
we're up here.

546
00:26:37,322 --> 00:26:38,824
No one knows we're up here.

547
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:40,659
They didn't forget
that we're up here, okay?

548
00:26:40,664 --> 00:26:42,763
There's cameras
all over the place.

549
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:45,166
- Hello!
- Hey!

550
00:26:45,202 --> 00:26:48,467
Assholes, start the chair!
We're freezing!

551
00:26:49,673 --> 00:26:50,217
Oh my God.

552
00:26:50,222 --> 00:26:52,404
What if they can't
get the chair moving?

553
00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:54,506
What if... what if
everyone went home?

554
00:26:54,511 --> 00:26:56,065
Hey hey, you know
what you need to do?

555
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,009
You need to stop, okay?

556
00:26:57,014 --> 00:26:59,111
You're just scaring
the shit out of me.

557
00:26:59,116 --> 00:27:01,024
By the way, remind me to knock...

558
00:27:01,029 --> 00:27:03,081
the shit out of
that chairlift guy.

559
00:27:03,086 --> 00:27:04,850
What exactly did
you say to him?

560
00:27:04,855 --> 00:27:07,119
What? Nothing.
I didn't say anything to him.

561
00:27:07,124 --> 00:27:08,925
Well, you clearly
pissed him off...

562
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:09,855
enough to do this.

563
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,189
Look, he knows we're up here.

564
00:27:11,194 --> 00:27:13,685
Then why are the
lights off, Dan?

565
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,093
Is that part of their policy?

566
00:27:15,098 --> 00:27:16,862
Turn off the lights
and scare the customers?

567
00:27:16,867 --> 00:27:18,867
I don't know.

568
00:27:18,902 --> 00:27:21,366
Maybe it's a power outage
or something, okay?

569
00:27:21,371 --> 00:27:23,371
That stuff happens
all the time.

570
00:27:23,407 --> 00:27:26,399
They didn't go home.
That's retarded.

571
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:32,213
This is so messed up.

572
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,548
I mean, worst-case scenario...

573
00:27:39,589 --> 00:27:42,049
they send up a ladder
or something, right?

574
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:51,534
Worst case I could just jump.

575
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:54,864
I've done that before.

576
00:27:54,905 --> 00:27:57,373
It's not so bad.

577
00:28:04,648 --> 00:28:06,219
We have to get
off these chairs.

578
00:28:06,224 --> 00:28:07,746
We can't stay up
in this chair.

579
00:28:07,751 --> 00:28:09,815
Why isn't the goddamn chair
moving, Dan?

580
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,941
You acting all psycho
is not gonna...

581
00:28:11,946 --> 00:28:13,946
make the chair
move along, okay?

582
00:28:14,925 --> 00:28:16,925
All right?

583
00:28:19,362 --> 00:28:22,456
Please don't yell at me.

584
00:28:23,533 --> 00:28:25,533
I didn't mean to yell.

585
00:28:27,136 --> 00:28:29,433
This shit happens
all the time though, okay?

586
00:28:29,438 --> 00:28:32,965
I mean, they can't just leave
people up on chairs.

587
00:28:33,008 --> 00:28:35,773
You know the kind of lawsuit
that they would have?

588
00:28:35,778 --> 00:28:37,778
What other people?

589
00:28:39,148 --> 00:28:41,343
There wasn't anybody
in front of us.

590
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:45,349
They're not gonna leave us
up here all night.

591
00:28:45,354 --> 00:28:47,754
That's all I'm saying.

592
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,286
It's Sunday.

593
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:51,657
It's fucking Sunday...

594
00:28:51,694 --> 00:28:53,691
and they're not open
again till Friday.

595
00:28:53,696 --> 00:28:56,494
We're gonna be stuck
here all week.

596
00:28:56,532 --> 00:28:58,762
Oh God.

597
00:28:58,801 --> 00:29:01,463
We're not gonna
be stuck up here.

598
00:29:01,504 --> 00:29:03,938
Parker.
Parker, look at me.

599
00:29:03,973 --> 00:29:05,969
Come on, there is no
way a ski resort...

600
00:29:05,974 --> 00:29:07,071
would let that happen,

601
00:29:07,076 --> 00:29:09,442
no matter how shitty
they are, okay?

602
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:30,230
Hello!

603
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:33,292
Somebody help us, please!

604
00:29:33,335 --> 00:29:36,532
- Somebody! Hello!
- Hey hey hey.

605
00:29:36,572 --> 00:29:38,669
- Come on, it's all right.
- Somebody!

606
00:29:38,674 --> 00:29:40,404
Shh.
Come on, it's okay.

607
00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:42,406
They're gonna turn
the power on in a minute.

608
00:29:42,411 --> 00:29:43,888
We're all gonna be...

609
00:29:43,893 --> 00:29:46,074
laughing about
this. Seriously.

610
00:29:48,918 --> 00:29:50,918
I have to pee.

611
00:29:55,024 --> 00:29:56,554
I have to pee wicked bad.

612
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,522
Yeah, that makes two of us.

613
00:29:58,527 --> 00:30:00,527
Ew, Lynch.

614
00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:03,227
If you pull your junk out
in front of me, I might puke.

615
00:30:03,232 --> 00:30:05,150
Well, what do you
want me to do?

616
00:30:05,155 --> 00:30:07,155
I've got to go.

617
00:30:07,269 --> 00:30:09,200
How am I supposed to go?

618
00:30:09,205 --> 00:30:11,936
I don't know. Just, you know,
lift this up and bend down.

619
00:30:11,941 --> 00:30:14,603
Are you crazy?
Put the bar down.

620
00:30:14,643 --> 00:30:16,941
It's just a safety bar, okay?
It doesn't really do anything.

621
00:30:16,946 --> 00:30:19,486
Well, I like the safety
bar and I like it...

622
00:30:19,491 --> 00:30:21,312
down where it's
supposed to be.

623
00:30:21,317 --> 00:30:23,317
Well, how are you gonna piss?

624
00:30:25,287 --> 00:30:28,586
- I can hold it.
- For a week?

625
00:30:33,128 --> 00:30:34,779
What? She's the one saying...

626
00:30:34,784 --> 00:30:36,784
we're gonna be
here for a week.

627
00:30:40,269 --> 00:30:42,269
I can hold it.

628
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:44,902
Well, I can't.
I'm pissing.

629
00:30:44,907 --> 00:30:48,035
Ew, that is so gross, Lynch.

630
00:30:48,077 --> 00:30:50,375
Well, too bad, okay?

631
00:30:51,747 --> 00:30:53,747
Make me wait up here...

632
00:30:53,749 --> 00:30:56,047
in this below
freezing weather...

633
00:30:57,953 --> 00:31:00,021
while I wait for
this Fisher-Price...

634
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:00,751
lift to work.

635
00:31:00,756 --> 00:31:02,586
Ah.

636
00:31:02,591 --> 00:31:04,991
Oh shit.

637
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:37,259
Hey!
We're up here!

638
00:31:37,293 --> 00:31:39,318
Hello!

639
00:31:39,361 --> 00:31:41,693
- Somebody help us!
- Somebody!

640
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,627
- Put the bar down, Joe.
- Help!

641
00:31:43,632 --> 00:31:46,123
Put the goddamn bar down, Joe!

642
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:50,070
God, it feels like a needle.

643
00:32:26,408 --> 00:32:28,968
Hey!
Hey!

644
00:32:29,011 --> 00:32:31,639
What did I tell you guys?

645
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,205
Hello!

646
00:32:34,249 --> 00:32:37,218
- Hey!
- Hey, we're over here!

647
00:32:37,252 --> 00:32:39,720
Whoo-hoo!

648
00:32:43,092 --> 00:32:45,322
Up here!

649
00:32:45,361 --> 00:32:48,489
- Whoo-hoo!
- Help us!

650
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:51,226
Help us!

651
00:32:51,266 --> 00:32:53,266
Cody, this is base.

652
00:32:55,404 --> 00:32:58,498
Why is he stopping?

653
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:01,236
He's gonna help us.
He sees us.

654
00:33:01,276 --> 00:33:02,573
Go for Cody.

655
00:33:02,578 --> 00:33:04,842
Hey man, where you at?

656
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:08,379
I'm cutting over to Pinewood
to pick up Barnes.

657
00:33:08,384 --> 00:33:11,384
No, man, Barnes just landed.
The mountain is clear.

658
00:33:11,387 --> 00:33:13,784
Come back to base so we can
get the hell out of here.

659
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:17,747
Copy that.

660
00:33:18,926 --> 00:33:21,952
Hey, where are you going?

661
00:33:21,996 --> 00:33:24,556
- Hey! Hey!
- Where's he going?

662
00:33:27,602 --> 00:33:30,264
- What is he doing?
- Where is he going?

663
00:33:30,304 --> 00:33:33,034
- Up here!
- We're up here!

664
00:33:38,513 --> 00:33:40,743
- Hey!
- Come on.

665
00:33:40,782 --> 00:33:42,782
Up here.

666
00:33:46,187 --> 00:33:48,187
Hey!

667
00:33:49,957 --> 00:33:53,620
- Hey!
- Please don't leave us!

668
00:33:53,661 --> 00:33:56,960
- Look up!
- No!

669
00:33:56,998 --> 00:34:00,297
- Come back! Stop!
- Hey!

670
00:34:00,334 --> 00:34:03,997
Stop! Stop!

671
00:34:08,009 --> 00:34:10,102
Hey, come back!

672
00:34:15,283 --> 00:34:17,649
Come back. We're here.

673
00:34:17,685 --> 00:34:21,246
No. No.

674
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:44,207
My face is burning.

675
00:34:44,245 --> 00:34:45,741
Power's coming back on.

676
00:34:45,746 --> 00:34:48,613
- No it isn't.
- It has to.

677
00:34:48,649 --> 00:34:49,153
Parker:

678
00:34:49,158 --> 00:34:51,618
Does anybody know
what time it is?

679
00:34:51,652 --> 00:34:55,053
Hold on. Let me just
run back to the locker.

680
00:34:55,089 --> 00:34:57,182
I'll check my
phone real quick.

681
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,024
Okay,

682
00:35:02,063 --> 00:35:04,327
top three breakfast cereals
of all time.

683
00:35:04,332 --> 00:35:06,357
Go.

684
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,164
Okay, I'll go first.

685
00:35:08,169 --> 00:35:10,694
Uh, crunch Berries.

686
00:35:10,738 --> 00:35:13,468
- Stop.
- Cinnamon Toast crunch.

687
00:35:13,508 --> 00:35:15,171
Please stop.

688
00:35:15,176 --> 00:35:17,039
And I'm gonna go out
on a limb and say

689
00:35:17,044 --> 00:35:19,478
Lucky charms
pre purple horseshoes.

690
00:35:19,514 --> 00:35:22,381
Is it just me or is
it really weird...

691
00:35:22,416 --> 00:35:24,816
eating purple horseshoes?

692
00:35:28,389 --> 00:35:30,584
Everybody went home.

693
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:33,321
They left us up here.

694
00:35:35,563 --> 00:35:38,413
Top three
celebrities you'd do.

695
00:35:38,418 --> 00:35:39,762
Go.

696
00:35:39,767 --> 00:35:41,767
Somebody needs to jump.

697
00:35:43,871 --> 00:35:46,704
If we're up here all week
we're gonna die.

698
00:35:54,549 --> 00:35:56,744
Hey. Shh.

699
00:35:56,784 --> 00:35:59,218
Hey.

700
00:35:59,253 --> 00:36:01,517
Shh shh.

701
00:36:01,556 --> 00:36:02,306
- It's okay.

702
00:36:02,311 --> 00:36:04,376
I don't want to
die up here, Dan.

703
00:36:04,392 --> 00:36:07,361
No no no.
Hey, you're not gonna die.

704
00:36:07,395 --> 00:36:11,126
I promise I won't let you die.

705
00:36:12,733 --> 00:36:14,963
Okay?

706
00:36:16,604 --> 00:36:19,095
I'm so...

707
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,768
I'm so scared.

708
00:36:21,809 --> 00:36:24,642
Yeah, me too.

709
00:36:28,082 --> 00:36:30,710
Oh my God.

710
00:36:32,753 --> 00:36:34,753
Hey, guys.

711
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:40,392
What was the best Christmas
present you guys ever got?

712
00:36:41,495 --> 00:36:43,725
Shaina my puppy.

713
00:36:43,764 --> 00:36:46,392
Hey, Dan?

714
00:36:46,434 --> 00:36:48,434
No? Okay.

715
00:36:48,436 --> 00:36:50,597
I guess it's my turn.

716
00:36:51,606 --> 00:36:54,734
My skis.
You get it?

717
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:58,840
- Oh shit.
- Oh! Shit.

718
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,746
Hey. Hey.

719
00:37:05,786 --> 00:37:08,687
Look at me.
Look at me.

720
00:37:08,723 --> 00:37:10,816
Look at me. Look at me.

721
00:37:10,858 --> 00:37:13,088
Your face is...

722
00:37:13,127 --> 00:37:16,324
it's really red.
I think you got frostbite.

723
00:37:16,788 --> 00:37:19,458
No, you can't get
frostbite that fast.

724
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,695
We've only been up here, what?

725
00:37:21,736 --> 00:37:24,967
I mean, it's only been
a few hours tops.

726
00:37:25,006 --> 00:37:27,106
- What are you doing?
- I'm jumping.

727
00:37:27,141 --> 00:37:28,971
- No you're not.
- Yes I am.

728
00:37:28,976 --> 00:37:31,307
Even if I hurt myself
I can get myself down...

729
00:37:31,312 --> 00:37:33,712
and I can get us some help.

730
00:37:33,748 --> 00:37:35,011
It's too far, man.
You can't jump.

731
00:37:35,016 --> 00:37:37,013
- Do you have a better idea?
- Than jumping?

732
00:37:37,018 --> 00:37:38,648
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I got a better idea.

733
00:37:38,653 --> 00:37:40,916
We can wait till the morning.
I mean, someone's gonna come.

734
00:37:40,921 --> 00:37:42,318
A groomer or some shit.

735
00:37:42,323 --> 00:37:43,567
They're gonna groom
the mountain...

736
00:37:43,572 --> 00:37:44,353
when it's closed, huh?

737
00:37:44,358 --> 00:37:46,656
When it's not gonna be open
for another five days.

738
00:37:46,661 --> 00:37:49,186
- Dan, don't leave me.
- I can do this.

739
00:37:50,865 --> 00:37:53,800
All right, Joe's gonna
be here with you, okay?

740
00:37:53,834 --> 00:37:56,496
All right?
He'll take care of you.

741
00:37:56,537 --> 00:37:58,200
No, man, don't do this.
Walker, don't.

742
00:37:58,205 --> 00:38:01,368
Dan, don't leave me.
Please.

743
00:38:01,409 --> 00:38:03,740
Look at me.
Look at me.

744
00:38:05,945 --> 00:38:09,972
You're gonna be okay, baby.
You're gonna be okay.

745
00:38:17,857 --> 00:38:20,052
- Dan, no.
- Don't do this, man.

746
00:38:26,933 --> 00:38:30,391
Remember that thing I said
about having done this before?

747
00:38:31,905 --> 00:38:34,373
I totally lied.
I'm scared shitless.

748
00:39:01,568 --> 00:39:03,729
Dan! Danny!

749
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:06,295
Dan, are you okay?
Say something!

750
00:39:06,339 --> 00:39:09,137
Oh my God.

751
00:39:10,143 --> 00:39:11,606
Oh my God!

752
00:39:11,611 --> 00:39:14,375
Danny!
Talk to me, Danny!

753
00:39:14,414 --> 00:39:16,939
Oh my God.

754
00:39:16,983 --> 00:39:19,281
- Oh my God, my legs.
- Dan!

755
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:23,585
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

756
00:39:23,623 --> 00:39:25,887
My legs are broken!
Oh my God!

757
00:39:25,925 --> 00:39:28,086
Can you move, Dan?

758
00:39:28,128 --> 00:39:30,460
No, I can't.
I can't move.

759
00:39:30,497 --> 00:39:32,293
Okay, hold on.
Hold on, baby.

760
00:39:32,298 --> 00:39:34,429
- What are you doing?
- I've got to get down to him.

761
00:39:34,434 --> 00:39:35,930
Stop, you're gonna get hurt.
Calm down.

762
00:39:35,935 --> 00:39:38,165
No no no, stay there.

763
00:39:38,204 --> 00:39:40,635
Don't get off the chair.
Stay on the chair.

764
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,132
- How bad is it?
- It's bad.

765
00:39:44,177 --> 00:39:45,874
It's really bad.

766
00:39:45,879 --> 00:39:48,883
The bone is sticking
out of my leg.

767
00:39:48,888 --> 00:39:49,344
Help!

768
00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:51,476
Help!

769
00:39:51,518 --> 00:39:53,518
Please help!

770
00:39:53,553 --> 00:39:55,450
Hey, Dan, buddy.

771
00:39:55,455 --> 00:39:57,051
Dan, can you move at all?

772
00:39:57,056 --> 00:39:59,524
No, man, it's bad.

773
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:01,790
You can't slide down the hill
or anything?

774
00:40:01,795 --> 00:40:03,781
No, I can't slide down
the fucking hill!

775
00:40:03,786 --> 00:40:05,126
I'm bleeding to death, man!

776
00:40:05,131 --> 00:40:07,061
Okay okay.

777
00:40:07,066 --> 00:40:09,030
Can you stop the bleeding?

778
00:40:09,035 --> 00:40:11,970
- With what?
- Hold on.

779
00:40:17,076 --> 00:40:19,076
Here.

780
00:40:20,513 --> 00:40:22,010
Shit!

781
00:40:22,015 --> 00:40:23,578
Hey, Dan, hold on, man.

782
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:24,107
Hold on.

783
00:40:24,112 --> 00:40:26,279
I'm gonna throw
mine down to you.

784
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,447
Here it comes.
Ready?

785
00:40:31,057 --> 00:40:33,057
Can you get to it?

786
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,660
Just feel for it, buddy.

787
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:12,990
I got it.
I got it.

788
00:41:13,032 --> 00:41:15,944
Okay, Dan, you're
gonna have to...

789
00:41:15,949 --> 00:41:17,866
tie that to your legs.

790
00:41:17,871 --> 00:41:20,101
Tie it onto your legs
above where it's bleeding.

791
00:41:20,106 --> 00:41:22,836
Okay?
Like a tourniquet thing.

792
00:41:32,218 --> 00:41:35,619
Okay, hold on. Wait.
Here, take my coat.

793
00:41:35,655 --> 00:41:39,250
No, leave your coat on.
Don't take your coat off.

794
00:41:39,292 --> 00:41:41,222
It's okay.
I can huddle next to Lynch.

795
00:41:41,227 --> 00:41:43,227
- Please.
- Leave your coat on!

796
00:41:53,306 --> 00:41:55,536
Fuck!

797
00:42:03,149 --> 00:42:05,947
- Hey. Hey, Dan.
- What?

798
00:42:05,985 --> 00:42:08,249
Maybe I can climb
up to the cable...

799
00:42:08,288 --> 00:42:10,585
and get to a chair
that's closer to the ground.

800
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:13,621
You've got to be careful, man.
Those cables are razor sharp.

801
00:42:13,626 --> 00:42:15,556
You think you can
pull yourself...

802
00:42:15,561 --> 00:42:17,358
across on these chairs?

803
00:42:17,363 --> 00:42:18,626
I can't even do a pull-up.

804
00:42:18,631 --> 00:42:20,495
You never even tried
to do a fucking pull-up.

805
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,624
Your mom had to
write you a letter...

806
00:42:22,629 --> 00:42:24,669
so you could get
out of gym class.

807
00:42:26,172 --> 00:42:28,333
- Hey, Joe.
- Yeah?

808
00:42:28,374 --> 00:42:31,002
Remember Jenny Bluth?
Huh?

809
00:42:31,044 --> 00:42:31,799
Remember her?

810
00:42:31,804 --> 00:42:33,608
She could do a
fucking pull-up.

811
00:42:33,613 --> 00:42:35,343
I know, but...

812
00:42:35,348 --> 00:42:36,786
even if I get to that chair,

813
00:42:36,791 --> 00:42:38,846
how many more chairs
is it gonna take...

814
00:42:38,851 --> 00:42:41,671
before I get to one
that's closer to the ground?

815
00:42:42,288 --> 00:42:43,952
The poles.

816
00:42:43,957 --> 00:42:45,887
The poles, they all have
ladders on them, okay?

817
00:42:45,892 --> 00:42:47,288
The lift poles.

818
00:42:47,293 --> 00:42:49,057
You just have to find
your way to one of those.

819
00:42:49,062 --> 00:42:51,061
Okay.

820
00:42:51,063 --> 00:42:54,794
Okay, how far is that chair
away from the pole?

821
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:57,631
- I don't know.
- Just give me a second.

822
00:42:57,669 --> 00:43:00,103
Give me a second, all right?

823
00:43:00,138 --> 00:43:02,538
Wait, what if you fall too?

824
00:43:02,574 --> 00:43:04,934
Parker, if we stay up
here we're gonna...

825
00:43:04,939 --> 00:43:07,039
freeze to death
and he's gonna die.

826
00:43:08,347 --> 00:43:08,990
Okay, Dan.

827
00:43:08,995 --> 00:43:11,316
Dan, I'm gonna try
and scale back...

828
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:13,443
to the next chair.

829
00:43:15,988 --> 00:43:17,818
Baby.

830
00:43:17,823 --> 00:43:20,053
Baby, was that you?

831
00:43:20,092 --> 00:43:23,619
- What?
- Hey, shut up, Dan. Shut up.

832
00:43:25,497 --> 00:43:27,829
Oh my God.

833
00:43:27,866 --> 00:43:30,892
Oh my God.
That was a wolf.

834
00:43:30,936 --> 00:43:33,333
Dan, that's not a wolf, man.
That's a coyote or something.

835
00:43:33,573 --> 00:43:35,602
I know the sound
of a fucking wolf!

836
00:43:35,607 --> 00:43:37,973
- Help!
- They're scared of people.

837
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:40,478
- Help me!
- Come on, relax.

838
00:43:40,512 --> 00:43:41,779
When was the last
time you heard...

839
00:43:41,784 --> 00:43:42,943
of a wolf attack
in New England?

840
00:43:42,948 --> 00:43:46,042
Never.
They're pussies, man.

841
00:43:46,084 --> 00:43:49,024
The wolves around here,
they're not even that big.

842
00:43:50,922 --> 00:43:54,756
Hey. Hey, listen.
It could be worse, right?

843
00:43:54,793 --> 00:43:56,793
How could it be worse?

844
00:43:59,197 --> 00:44:01,324
It could be the sarlacc pit.

845
00:44:01,366 --> 00:44:05,097
Hey, Parker came through
with the tension breaker, bud.

846
00:44:05,137 --> 00:44:07,503
Your girl's all right, Walker.

847
00:44:07,539 --> 00:44:10,508
- Hey, she's all right.
- Just climb.

848
00:44:10,542 --> 00:44:13,010
Please, please just climb.

849
00:44:13,045 --> 00:44:16,276
Okay, hold on.
Hold on, I'm coming.

850
00:44:20,419 --> 00:44:22,215
Hold on.

851
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:24,848
It'll be okay, Dan.

852
00:44:27,826 --> 00:44:29,496
You know it's funny,
I was never...

853
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:31,124
afraid of heights
until right now.

854
00:44:31,129 --> 00:44:33,460
- Okay, what can I do to help?
- I don't know.

855
00:44:33,465 --> 00:44:35,465
Just hold on to my legs.

856
00:44:35,467 --> 00:44:37,998
I mean, you can't stop me
from falling but it's...

857
00:44:38,003 --> 00:44:40,000
it's like psychological
or something.

858
00:44:40,005 --> 00:44:42,530
- Okay.
- Okay.

859
00:44:44,342 --> 00:44:46,506
Oh shit, it's high.
It's really fucking high.

860
00:44:46,511 --> 00:44:47,869
- What can I do to help?

861
00:44:47,874 --> 00:44:49,743
Nothing. Just stop
talking, okay?

862
00:44:49,748 --> 00:44:51,748
- Okay.
- Okay.

863
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:54,241
Come on.

864
00:45:00,258 --> 00:45:02,155
Please hurry!

865
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,390
Dan, just be quiet, okay?

866
00:45:08,133 --> 00:45:10,133
Oh God.

867
00:45:11,803 --> 00:45:13,803
Shit, it's all ice.

868
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:17,240
Hey, Dan.
Dan, buddy, it's all ice.

869
00:45:17,275 --> 00:45:20,335
But I think if we knock it off
I can get to the top.

870
00:45:21,613 --> 00:45:23,613
Hold on.

871
00:45:25,851 --> 00:45:27,851
Shit.

872
00:45:43,835 --> 00:45:46,736
Oh shit.

873
00:45:47,739 --> 00:45:49,969
What am I supposed to do?

874
00:45:53,845 --> 00:45:56,313
You guys!

875
00:45:56,348 --> 00:45:58,348
What the fuck
am I supposed to do?

876
00:46:01,186 --> 00:46:03,186
Get the hell away from him!

877
00:46:12,597 --> 00:46:14,597
Hey.
Hey, are you all right?

878
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:16,692
Yeah.

879
00:46:16,735 --> 00:46:18,828
Yeah, I'm alive.

880
00:46:20,405 --> 00:46:22,369
See, I told you, man.

881
00:46:22,374 --> 00:46:25,639
They're more afraid of you
than you are of them. Huh?

882
00:46:25,677 --> 00:46:28,578
I don't know, man.
I'm pretty afraid.

883
00:46:28,613 --> 00:46:30,443
I know, man.
I know.

884
00:46:30,448 --> 00:46:33,042
I can't feel my legs anymore.

885
00:46:33,084 --> 00:46:36,383
That's not good, right?

886
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:39,481
I mean, they
don't hurt as bad,

887
00:46:39,524 --> 00:46:41,651
but that's not good.

888
00:46:41,693 --> 00:46:44,124
No no, it's fine.
You're gonna be all right.

889
00:46:44,129 --> 00:46:46,529
Okay, it's probably
really really bad.

890
00:46:46,565 --> 00:46:48,528
We're got to move and get...

891
00:46:48,533 --> 00:46:51,058
Hey hey hey.
Go like this.

892
00:46:51,102 --> 00:46:53,593
Ow.
Ow, it's like a sunburn.

893
00:46:53,638 --> 00:46:55,711
- No no, I think
it's frostbite.

894
00:46:55,716 --> 00:46:56,069
What?

895
00:46:56,074 --> 00:46:58,174
Is my face changing
color anywhere?

896
00:46:58,977 --> 00:47:01,411
I don't know.
I can't see anything.

897
00:47:01,446 --> 00:47:03,376
Don't... don't touch it.
Stop.

898
00:47:03,381 --> 00:47:05,381
- Stop.
- But it itches now.

899
00:47:05,383 --> 00:47:06,588
I know, but if you
rub your face...

900
00:47:06,593 --> 00:47:07,280
it's gonna come off.

901
00:47:07,285 --> 00:47:08,582
Will you just hurry
up up there? !

902
00:47:08,587 --> 00:47:10,851
Okay, I'm trying.
Hold on.

903
00:47:10,889 --> 00:47:12,889
Shit.

904
00:47:28,406 --> 00:47:29,769
Be careful.

905
00:47:29,774 --> 00:47:32,641
Okay, just don't talk.

906
00:47:35,947 --> 00:47:38,245
I can do this.

907
00:47:44,255 --> 00:47:46,185
Oh, I got you.

908
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:48,190
Shit, it's slippery.

909
00:47:48,959 --> 00:47:51,120
Don't look down.

910
00:47:56,267 --> 00:47:58,394
My boots are so heavy.

911
00:48:13,384 --> 00:48:16,444
The cable is cutting
through my gloves.

912
00:48:19,623 --> 00:48:21,750
Do you got it?

913
00:48:30,501 --> 00:48:32,501
Oh, my hands.

914
00:48:36,507 --> 00:48:38,532
Oh my God.

915
00:48:38,575 --> 00:48:40,702
What?
What's wrong?

916
00:48:40,744 --> 00:48:43,178
Oh my God.
Okay.

917
00:48:44,715 --> 00:48:47,343
What is it? What?

918
00:48:48,819 --> 00:48:50,819
I got you.
I got you, you're okay.

919
00:48:50,854 --> 00:48:52,854
I got you.

920
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:55,381
You're okay.

921
00:48:55,426 --> 00:48:57,156
What's wrong?

922
00:48:57,161 --> 00:48:58,657
- What's wrong?
- Don't look down.

923
00:48:58,662 --> 00:49:00,755
- What?
- Don't look. Don't look.

924
00:49:01,765 --> 00:49:03,329
- Lynch.
- Yeah, man?

925
00:49:03,334 --> 00:49:05,962
Don't you let her look.

926
00:49:06,003 --> 00:49:08,202
- Don't you fucking
let her look.

927
00:49:08,207 --> 00:49:08,500
Dan!

928
00:49:08,505 --> 00:49:10,905
- Shh.
- Dan!

929
00:49:10,941 --> 00:49:13,239
No, I won't, man.

930
00:49:13,277 --> 00:49:15,174
Don't.

931
00:49:15,179 --> 00:49:17,909
Don't you let her look!

932
00:49:17,948 --> 00:49:21,179
Dan!

933
00:49:26,256 --> 00:49:28,588
Let me look.
I need to look.

934
00:49:28,625 --> 00:49:31,150
I need to look!

935
00:49:31,195 --> 00:49:33,322
No!

936
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:37,997
No! Dan!

937
00:49:38,035 --> 00:49:40,560
Let me look!

938
00:49:44,742 --> 00:49:47,939
- No!
- Oh my God. Oh my God.

939
00:49:47,978 --> 00:49:51,175
Oh my God.

940
00:49:53,384 --> 00:49:55,875
Oh God.
Think about Dan.

941
00:50:01,725 --> 00:50:03,555
Shh shh.

942
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:06,140
Don't listen to it.
Just don't listen to it.

943
00:50:06,163 --> 00:50:08,256
Don't listen to it.

944
00:50:15,339 --> 00:50:17,864
Okay. Okay.

945
00:50:17,908 --> 00:50:20,706
Okay.

946
00:50:38,495 --> 00:50:40,793
Dan!

947
00:50:47,938 --> 00:50:49,938
No, Dan.

948
00:50:55,012 --> 00:50:57,310
No!

949
00:51:25,375 --> 00:51:27,502
Cables cut through my gloves.

950
00:51:27,544 --> 00:51:29,705
My hands are wasted.

951
00:51:30,714 --> 00:51:32,714
Why'd you let him jump?

952
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,154
You can't be serious.

953
00:51:40,157 --> 00:51:42,157
It was too far.

954
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:45,719
No, he said he could do it.

955
00:51:45,762 --> 00:51:48,128
You didn't try to stop him.

956
00:51:53,203 --> 00:51:56,034
I can't believe this.
Are you trying to blame me?

957
00:51:56,039 --> 00:51:58,003
No.

958
00:51:58,008 --> 00:51:59,605
No, I'm not blaming you.

959
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:01,106
I mean, you're his girlfriend.

960
00:52:01,111 --> 00:52:02,527
I didn't see you
trying to throw...

961
00:52:02,532 --> 00:52:03,542
yourself in front of him.

962
00:52:03,547 --> 00:52:05,879
He wasn't going
to listen to me.

963
00:52:05,916 --> 00:52:07,916
But he would have
listened to me?

964
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:11,747
No, I said it was a bad idea.

965
00:52:11,788 --> 00:52:13,552
I said it was too far a drop.

966
00:52:13,557 --> 00:52:15,553
I didn't hear any
ideas from you...

967
00:52:15,558 --> 00:52:17,558
except for crying about it.

968
00:52:18,128 --> 00:52:20,153
Don't you fucking blame me.

969
00:52:22,432 --> 00:52:24,601
You've been his
girlfriend for what,

970
00:52:24,606 --> 00:52:25,063
a year?

971
00:52:25,068 --> 00:52:27,067
Maybe?

972
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,666
I've known him
my entire fucking life.

973
00:52:34,877 --> 00:52:36,607
You should've...

974
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:38,739
- you should've...
- What?

975
00:52:40,983 --> 00:52:43,008
Say it!

976
00:52:45,087 --> 00:52:47,112
It should've been me.

977
00:52:47,156 --> 00:52:49,556
- No.
- That's what you want to say.

978
00:52:49,592 --> 00:52:51,856
No, that's...
that's not what I said.

979
00:52:51,894 --> 00:52:54,727
It's okay. I get it.
I get it.

980
00:52:54,764 --> 00:52:56,794
It should have been me
down there, right?

981
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:58,229
'Cause who gives
a fuck about me?

982
00:52:58,234 --> 00:53:00,234
No.

983
00:53:01,571 --> 00:53:03,167
You know what?

984
00:53:03,172 --> 00:53:04,537
If we hadn't spent
the entire day...

985
00:53:04,542 --> 00:53:05,603
on the fucking bunny hill...

986
00:53:05,608 --> 00:53:07,572
watching you fall
on your ass...

987
00:53:07,577 --> 00:53:09,574
we would have done some runs
and we could have gone home.

988
00:53:09,579 --> 00:53:11,706
I'm sorry.

989
00:53:13,416 --> 00:53:16,283
Or maybe if you hadn't
fucked with our thing.

990
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,549
Maybe if you had
just stayed home...

991
00:53:18,588 --> 00:53:20,715
and not tried to
force yourself...

992
00:53:20,756 --> 00:53:22,853
into every little
aspect of his life...

993
00:53:22,858 --> 00:53:24,989
my best friend
wouldn't be dead right now.

994
00:53:24,994 --> 00:53:27,394
That's...

995
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:29,260
not fair.

996
00:53:29,265 --> 00:53:31,265
That's not fair.

997
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:36,600
It's not fair
that my best friend is dead.

998
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:40,941
He's not coming back.
He's gone.

999
00:53:44,947 --> 00:53:48,075
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck you!

1000
00:54:09,238 --> 00:54:11,238
I'm sorry.

1001
00:54:14,577 --> 00:54:16,540
I'm sorry.

1002
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:19,537
I'm so sorry, Lynch.

1003
00:54:20,983 --> 00:54:22,983
Please.

1004
00:54:31,093 --> 00:54:33,152
I'm sorry.

1005
00:54:34,163 --> 00:54:37,724
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

1006
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:47,332
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it, okay?

1007
00:54:47,376 --> 00:54:49,810
I didn't mean it.

1008
00:55:05,695 --> 00:55:07,695
830.

1009
00:55:08,898 --> 00:55:10,861
Oh shit.

1010
00:55:10,866 --> 00:55:13,357
What were my numbers?

1011
00:55:13,402 --> 00:55:16,530
- 786...
- 7860.

1012
00:55:17,707 --> 00:55:20,505
830-7860.

1013
00:55:20,543 --> 00:55:22,543
Yeah.

1014
00:55:22,578 --> 00:55:25,274
I'm so gonna call that girl
when I get back.

1015
00:55:25,314 --> 00:55:27,578
You know what?

1016
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:30,414
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
No messing around.

1017
00:55:30,419 --> 00:55:31,790
I'm just gonna call
her and I'm gonna...

1018
00:55:31,795 --> 00:55:32,583
be like, 'Hey, Shannon.

1019
00:55:32,588 --> 00:55:35,319
It's Joe from the chairlift.
Will you marry me?'

1020
00:55:35,324 --> 00:55:37,451
We'll get a house,
have two kids...

1021
00:55:37,493 --> 00:55:39,223
and a dog named Steve.

1022
00:55:39,228 --> 00:55:41,721
- Who's gonna pay
for the house?

1023
00:55:41,726 --> 00:55:42,460
She will.

1024
00:55:42,465 --> 00:55:44,592
She's got a great job.

1025
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:46,564
What does she do?

1026
00:55:46,569 --> 00:55:49,129
Orthodontist.

1027
00:55:49,589 --> 00:55:51,602
Orthodontists make
a lot of money.

1028
00:55:51,607 --> 00:55:53,471
Yeah.

1029
00:55:53,476 --> 00:55:57,037
Well, I'm sure the two of you
will be really happy.

1030
00:55:58,414 --> 00:56:01,645
830-7860.

1031
00:56:03,786 --> 00:56:05,483
Who names their dog Steve?

1032
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:07,752
I will.

1033
00:56:09,024 --> 00:56:11,219
Steve's a people name.

1034
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:13,490
Says who?

1035
00:56:16,198 --> 00:56:18,362
You don't, like,
go to someone's house...

1036
00:56:18,367 --> 00:56:21,996
and have them say,
'Here, meet my dog Steve.'

1037
00:56:23,038 --> 00:56:23,487
Why not?

1038
00:56:23,492 --> 00:56:25,636
I think Steve's a
good name for a dog.

1039
00:56:25,641 --> 00:56:27,973
Here, meet my cat Chris.

1040
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:30,740
No cat.

1041
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:33,840
Just a dog...
Steve.

1042
00:56:37,219 --> 00:56:39,744
Shaina must be so hungry.

1043
00:56:43,292 --> 00:56:44,889
What kind of pizza
should we get?

1044
00:56:44,894 --> 00:56:46,894
The poor thing.

1045
00:56:48,364 --> 00:56:51,128
She's just a puppy.

1046
00:56:52,501 --> 00:56:56,198
She's not gonna understand
that I died.

1047
00:56:58,307 --> 00:57:00,832
She's gonna think that I left,

1048
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:02,876
that I forgot about her.

1049
00:57:03,979 --> 00:57:06,607
She's probably waiting...

1050
00:57:06,649 --> 00:57:09,049
by the front door right now.

1051
00:57:09,084 --> 00:57:12,815
At every little noise
that she hears...

1052
00:57:12,855 --> 00:57:14,350
in the hallway,

1053
00:57:14,355 --> 00:57:17,620
she's probably
cocking her little head...

1054
00:57:17,659 --> 00:57:19,854
to the side...

1055
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:22,522
wondering when
I'm gonna come in.

1056
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:25,158
But I won't.

1057
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,498
I won't come in.

1058
00:57:27,535 --> 00:57:30,663
And she's gonna...
she's gonna starve to death.

1059
00:57:34,108 --> 00:57:36,072
She's gonna starve to death...

1060
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:39,672
waiting for me to come in.

1061
00:57:39,714 --> 00:57:42,012
It's all my fault.

1062
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:44,848
She's not gonna
starve to death.

1063
00:57:44,886 --> 00:57:47,582
You're not gonna die, Parker.

1064
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:51,991
I'm the only one with a key
to my apartment, though.

1065
00:57:52,026 --> 00:57:53,477
Yeah, I know, but
the neighbors...

1066
00:57:53,482 --> 00:57:54,591
will kick the door down...

1067
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:57,497
if she doesn't stop barking.

1068
00:57:57,532 --> 00:57:59,932
Someone will figure it out.

1069
00:57:59,968 --> 00:58:02,334
She'll be just fine.

1070
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:06,239
So will you.

1071
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,834
So will we.

1072
00:58:17,318 --> 00:58:19,318
I just want to see my mom.

1073
00:58:22,056 --> 00:58:24,056
And my dad.

1074
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:11,717
Ah!

1075
01:01:18,399 --> 01:01:21,095
I thought I was dreaming.

1076
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:24,036
I thought I was dreaming this.

1077
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:35,774
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

1078
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:39,151
Your frostbite is
getting worse.

1079
01:01:40,021 --> 01:01:42,841
- Really? How bad...
- Don't touch it. It's bad.

1080
01:01:45,259 --> 01:01:47,123
It doesn't itch
as much anymore.

1081
01:01:47,128 --> 01:01:49,562
Okay, don't touch
your face though.

1082
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,763
When we get out of here
I'm gonna get you to a doctor.

1083
01:01:53,768 --> 01:01:56,328
- They'll fix it right away.
- You have...

1084
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:58,998
You have red marks
on your face too.

1085
01:02:02,442 --> 01:02:04,467
They'll fix me up too.

1086
01:02:06,113 --> 01:02:08,513
Don't. Don't.
Don't touch it. It's bad.

1087
01:02:12,786 --> 01:02:14,786
Well, it's the morning.

1088
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:18,687
Maybe someone
will come up now.

1089
01:02:18,692 --> 01:02:20,785
For what?

1090
01:02:22,796 --> 01:02:24,991
Mountain maintenance.
I don't know.

1091
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:28,737
Besides, if we don't
show up for class...

1092
01:02:28,742 --> 01:02:29,898
people will start
looking for us.

1093
01:02:29,903 --> 01:02:31,928
No one knows we're here.

1094
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:35,770
I didn't tell anyone
I was coming.

1095
01:02:38,145 --> 01:02:39,641
Help!

1096
01:02:39,646 --> 01:02:42,638
We need help!

1097
01:02:51,091 --> 01:02:54,271
If I can get to that pole
I can climb down the ladder.

1098
01:02:58,064 --> 01:03:01,004
How are you gonna climb
with your hands like that?

1099
01:03:02,569 --> 01:03:04,399
We won't make it
another night.

1100
01:03:04,404 --> 01:03:06,668
Are you sure you
don't want to...

1101
01:03:06,706 --> 01:03:09,038
wait a few hours?

1102
01:03:09,075 --> 01:03:11,075
I mean, maybe you're right.

1103
01:03:11,111 --> 01:03:13,978
Maybe someone's
coming in today.

1104
01:05:38,158 --> 01:05:40,718
The sun feels good.

1105
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:44,287
First we're freezing,
now we're gonna get sunburned.

1106
01:05:44,331 --> 01:05:46,697
Be careful what you
wish for, right?

1107
01:05:46,733 --> 01:05:49,327
How come you
never have a girlfriend?

1108
01:05:49,848 --> 01:05:52,463
How am I supposed
to answer that?

1109
01:05:52,979 --> 01:05:55,133
I just mean you're
a decent guy.

1110
01:05:55,175 --> 01:05:57,405
And chicks dig you.

1111
01:05:57,444 --> 01:06:00,140
But you never
have a relationship.

1112
01:06:02,361 --> 01:06:04,012
I had a serious
girlfriend once.

1113
01:06:04,017 --> 01:06:06,577
- High school doesn't count.
- No.

1114
01:06:06,619 --> 01:06:08,917
No, post high school.
Freshman year.

1115
01:06:08,955 --> 01:06:10,885
Who?

1116
01:06:10,890 --> 01:06:13,688
This girl Annie.

1117
01:06:13,727 --> 01:06:17,219
We met at freshman
orientation.

1118
01:06:17,263 --> 01:06:19,857
We emailed each other
during the summer.

1119
01:06:19,899 --> 01:06:22,731
When we got back to school
it was like we were dating.

1120
01:06:22,736 --> 01:06:24,265
Oh.

1121
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:27,398
I just really felt it
with her, you know?

1122
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,971
We were into the same stuff,
which was cool.

1123
01:06:29,976 --> 01:06:32,206
She was way into Aerosmith.

1124
01:06:32,245 --> 01:06:34,442
I'd seen 'em five times.
She'd seem 'em eight.

1125
01:06:34,447 --> 01:06:36,881
What happened?

1126
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:41,719
She, uh...

1127
01:06:42,956 --> 01:06:46,255
had the same favorite
movie as me... ET.

1128
01:06:47,494 --> 01:06:50,360
It was like soulmates,
that shit you read about.

1129
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:57,367
So what happened?

1130
01:06:58,470 --> 01:07:00,300
Same old shit.

1131
01:07:00,305 --> 01:07:02,535
No.

1132
01:07:02,574 --> 01:07:05,099
You know what happened?
She...

1133
01:07:05,144 --> 01:07:07,144
she liked another guy.

1134
01:07:08,614 --> 01:07:13,244
This fraternity douchebag
named Dean.

1135
01:07:14,586 --> 01:07:17,054
She dumped you for a frat guy?

1136
01:07:17,089 --> 01:07:18,919
No.

1137
01:07:18,924 --> 01:07:21,119
No, I dumped her.

1138
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:23,390
We were in the
cafeteria, right?

1139
01:07:23,429 --> 01:07:24,858
You know, we were
having lunch,

1140
01:07:24,863 --> 01:07:25,692
facing each other.

1141
01:07:25,697 --> 01:07:27,752
I was facing the
wall and she was...

1142
01:07:27,757 --> 01:07:29,757
facing everybody behind me.

1143
01:07:32,871 --> 01:07:34,930
And I kept seeing her, like,

1144
01:07:34,973 --> 01:07:36,341
you know, looking at somebody.

1145
01:07:36,346 --> 01:07:37,805
You know, like
kind of laughing.

1146
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:39,706
And I was just like,
you know,

1147
01:07:39,711 --> 01:07:41,642
'What's so funny?' You know?

1148
01:07:41,647 --> 01:07:43,877
And, you know, like,
'What the hell is going on?'

1149
01:07:43,882 --> 01:07:45,882
And she said...

1150
01:07:49,455 --> 01:07:51,855
she said,
'Dean's making fun of you.'

1151
01:07:51,890 --> 01:07:53,956
So I turn around
and I'm ready to...

1152
01:07:53,961 --> 01:07:56,061
just beat the shit
out of this guy.

1153
01:07:57,663 --> 01:08:00,603
But all I can see are these
random fucking people.

1154
01:08:00,632 --> 01:08:02,759
All these faces.

1155
01:08:02,801 --> 01:08:06,601
This guy was making eyes
at my girl and could see me...

1156
01:08:06,638 --> 01:08:09,607
but I couldn't see him.

1157
01:08:13,011 --> 01:08:15,309
That's messed up.

1158
01:08:17,316 --> 01:08:19,443
I never felt so stupid.

1159
01:08:21,086 --> 01:08:23,316
I just walked out.

1160
01:08:24,323 --> 01:08:26,253
You just walked out?

1161
01:08:26,258 --> 01:08:27,487
Yeah, I told her
to laugh it up...

1162
01:08:27,492 --> 01:08:28,322
with Dean the frat guy.

1163
01:08:28,327 --> 01:08:30,057
I was out.

1164
01:08:30,062 --> 01:08:32,530
That sucks.

1165
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:37,731
Maybe I shouldn't have been
so quick to walk away.

1166
01:08:37,736 --> 01:08:40,667
You know, maybe I should
have had a thicker skin...

1167
01:08:40,672 --> 01:08:42,772
and not been
such a sensitive bitch.

1168
01:08:49,248 --> 01:08:52,547
Sometimes I feel like
I was just insecure.

1169
01:08:52,584 --> 01:08:54,677
Maybe I screwed up.

1170
01:08:57,689 --> 01:08:59,884
You should tell her that.

1171
01:08:59,925 --> 01:09:02,985
When you get home
you should call her.

1172
01:09:05,697 --> 01:09:07,697
I can't.

1173
01:09:11,203 --> 01:09:13,228
She's dating Dean.

1174
01:09:23,882 --> 01:09:25,882
I should have done something.

1175
01:09:29,388 --> 01:09:30,918
There was nothing
you could have done.

1176
01:09:30,923 --> 01:09:34,450
I just sat here
and I let him die.

1177
01:09:34,493 --> 01:09:37,189
No, you didn't.
We didn't let him die, okay?

1178
01:09:37,229 --> 01:09:38,926
There was nothing
we could have done.

1179
01:09:38,931 --> 01:09:41,559
He jumped down there
to save us, okay?

1180
01:09:45,337 --> 01:09:47,067
He was the one.

1181
01:09:47,072 --> 01:09:49,973
He was the boy
I was gonna marry.

1182
01:09:52,644 --> 01:09:54,771
Hey.

1183
01:09:54,813 --> 01:09:56,974
First grade...

1184
01:09:57,015 --> 01:10:00,382
and we get left there
by our moms...

1185
01:10:00,419 --> 01:10:01,815
for the day.

1186
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:03,750
It's like the first
real day of school,

1187
01:10:03,755 --> 01:10:05,419
you know,
without your folks around.

1188
01:10:05,424 --> 01:10:09,326
And Dan was this
chubby little kid.

1189
01:10:09,361 --> 01:10:11,386
No, fuck it.

1190
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:14,422
He was a fat ass.

1191
01:10:14,466 --> 01:10:17,060
And so our moms all leave...

1192
01:10:17,102 --> 01:10:19,562
but Dan wouldn't let go
of his mom's hand.

1193
01:10:20,272 --> 01:10:21,974
And even after she
left he just stood...

1194
01:10:21,979 --> 01:10:23,170
at the front of the class...

1195
01:10:23,175 --> 01:10:25,268
crying like a total pussy.

1196
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:28,190
- That sounds like Dan.
- Yeah, you have no idea.

1197
01:10:29,648 --> 01:10:32,116
Anyway, so the teacher...

1198
01:10:32,150 --> 01:10:34,914
oh, what's her name?

1199
01:10:38,824 --> 01:10:40,554
Mrs. Schifrin.

1200
01:10:40,559 --> 01:10:42,574
So Mrs. Schifrin is
trying everything...

1201
01:10:42,579 --> 01:10:44,291
to get the fat kid
to stop crying.

1202
01:10:44,296 --> 01:10:46,924
And she says,

1203
01:10:46,965 --> 01:10:49,263
'You know,
maybe there's somebody...

1204
01:10:49,301 --> 01:10:51,428
somebody else
you know in the class.

1205
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:54,170
Maybe you have a friend
you want to sit with.'

1206
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:58,937
And this little fucker points
right at me and says, 'Him.'

1207
01:10:58,977 --> 01:11:01,878
Now I've never seen
this kid in my life.

1208
01:11:03,315 --> 01:11:06,716
But for some reason
he pointed at me.

1209
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:10,550
- So you had to sit with him?
- Yeah, for a whole week.

1210
01:11:10,555 --> 01:11:12,418
Whole first week of
school I had to share...

1211
01:11:12,423 --> 01:11:13,820
my little cubby
with his fat ass.

1212
01:11:13,825 --> 01:11:15,986
Oh, gosh.

1213
01:11:19,231 --> 01:11:21,931
He was a douchebag.
I never let him forget it.

1214
01:11:38,783 --> 01:11:40,958
Dan didn't die up
here just for you...

1215
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,963
and I to give up and die too.

1216
01:11:54,532 --> 01:11:56,532
Help me up.

1217
01:12:13,551 --> 01:12:15,678
Are you okay?

1218
01:12:21,559 --> 01:12:22,755
Oh God!

1219
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:24,557
Oh shit.

1220
01:12:24,562 --> 01:12:27,725
- Shit, just hold on.
- Oh my God.

1221
01:12:27,765 --> 01:12:30,663
- The chair is gonna fall.
- No it's not. No it's not.

1222
01:12:30,668 --> 01:12:33,694
Oh, God.

1223
01:12:36,674 --> 01:12:38,699
My hands.

1224
01:12:47,485 --> 01:12:49,612
Oh God, my hands.

1225
01:13:35,065 --> 01:13:37,065
Joe!

1226
01:13:49,013 --> 01:13:51,013
Fuck you, Jenny Bluth.

1227
01:13:52,149 --> 01:13:54,777
Oh fuck.

1228
01:14:04,094 --> 01:14:06,654
Oh shit.
Shit.

1229
01:14:06,697 --> 01:14:09,222
- Hey, Parker.
- What?

1230
01:14:09,266 --> 01:14:10,920
I need you to throw
my extra pole...

1231
01:14:10,925 --> 01:14:12,164
as far as you can this way.

1232
01:14:12,169 --> 01:14:14,169
What?

1233
01:14:14,205 --> 01:14:16,799
I said I want you
to throw my ski pole...

1234
01:14:16,841 --> 01:14:19,469
as far down the
hill as you can.

1235
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:21,907
I'm gonna need some defense
when I get on the ground.

1236
01:14:21,912 --> 01:14:24,005
Okay.

1237
01:14:53,711 --> 01:14:55,711
Okay.

1238
01:15:04,121 --> 01:15:06,453
Oh my God.

1239
01:15:09,293 --> 01:15:11,955
- Shit.
- I'm sorry.

1240
01:15:11,996 --> 01:15:15,090
It's okay.

1241
01:15:23,841 --> 01:15:26,469
Shit.
Oh shit.

1242
01:15:28,579 --> 01:15:30,142
Okay.

1243
01:15:30,147 --> 01:15:31,744
You can do it.

1244
01:15:31,749 --> 01:15:34,377
You can do it.
Please do it.

1245
01:16:09,119 --> 01:16:11,610
Please don't break.
Please don't break.

1246
01:16:23,233 --> 01:16:25,326
Shit.

1247
01:16:28,137 --> 01:16:31,106
I just want to go.
Please let me go.

1248
01:16:55,531 --> 01:16:58,159
You did it!
You did it!

1249
01:17:06,576 --> 01:17:08,539
- Oh shit.
- Joe!

1250
01:17:08,544 --> 01:17:10,544
Lynch!

1251
01:17:11,614 --> 01:17:14,048
- Lynch!
- I'm okay.

1252
01:17:39,776 --> 01:17:41,776
No! No!

1253
01:17:55,458 --> 01:17:57,585
No!

1254
01:18:11,174 --> 01:18:13,768
Stay the fuck back!

1255
01:18:18,347 --> 01:18:20,406
Try and stay still.

1256
01:18:24,420 --> 01:18:26,615
I'll be back as fast as I can.

1257
01:18:26,656 --> 01:18:29,056
Please please hurry.
Please.

1258
01:18:31,427 --> 01:18:34,453
Joe, look out!

1259
01:18:39,302 --> 01:18:41,964
Joe!

1260
01:21:01,344 --> 01:21:03,344
Aw, Joe...

1261
01:23:10,071 --> 01:23:12,071
Ow!

1262
01:26:14,421 --> 01:26:16,446
Hello!

1263
01:26:22,229 --> 01:26:24,229
Help, please!

1264
01:26:24,264 --> 01:26:26,264
Wait!

1265
01:27:32,799 --> 01:27:35,097
Hey, you okay?

1266
01:27:35,135 --> 01:27:36,732
Hello?

1267
01:27:36,737 --> 01:27:38,634
Hey, you all right?

1268
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:41,267
Hold on.
Hold on.

1269
01:27:41,308 --> 01:27:42,738
Hold on.

1270
01:27:42,743 --> 01:27:44,768
I'm gonna get you help.

1271
01:27:47,581 --> 01:27:49,511
No, there were no other cars.

1272
01:27:49,516 --> 01:27:51,455
I found her laying in the road...

1273
01:27:51,460 --> 01:27:53,460
right outside of
Mt. Holliston.

1274
01:27:56,490 --> 01:27:58,788
I'm taking her to you now.

1275
01:28:00,027 --> 01:28:02,325
Hold on.

1276
01:28:02,362 --> 01:28:04,557
The hospital
is only 10 minutes away.

1277
01:28:05,999 --> 01:28:07,896
You're gonna be okay.

1278
01:28:07,901 --> 01:28:10,131
You're gonna be okay.

1279
01:28:11,438 --> 01:28:13,778
You're gonna be okay, baby.

1280
01:28:15,842 --> 01:28:18,037
You're gonna be okay.
