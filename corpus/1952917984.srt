-It won't.
-MAN: That's right.

1210

It's not justice we need or even want.

MAN: In another life,

1223
01:34:00,752 --> 01:34:02,743
I was another man.

1224
01:34:03,287 --> 01:34:07,417
I was a thief and a fool.

1225
01:34:07,592 --> 01:34:11,619
A policeman, who rightly was trying
to bring me to justice, pursued me.

1226
01:34:12,363 --> 01:34:13,955
I ran,

1227
01:34:14,132 --> 01:34:17,568
and I took this family's child
away from them.

1228
01:34:18,636 --> 01:34:20,831
It was prison, finally, that broke me.

1229
01:34:21,005 --> 01:34:23,496
I surrendered my life to my father,

1230
01:34:23,674 --> 01:34:27,872
and I sought to make amends
for the mess that I made of that life.

1231
01:34:28,546 --> 01:34:32,346
For penance, I entered the mission
field in my ancestors' land of Kenya.

1232
01:34:32,517 --> 01:34:35,418
Now it is the thing for which I live.

1233
01:34:35,586 --> 01:34:40,888
I paid society for my crime
with eight years of my life.

1234
01:34:41,058 --> 01:34:45,586
Justice was served,
but not to this family.

1235
01:34:45,763 --> 01:34:47,697
I owe them a debt I can never repay.

1236
01:34:48,833 --> 01:34:55,466
I cannot and I will not go another day
without facing them

1237
01:34:55,640 --> 01:35:00,134
and accepting responsibility
for what I have done.

1238
01:35:09,020 --> 01:35:10,214
With all my heart,

1239
01:35:11,689 --> 01:35:13,714
I am sorry.

1240
01:35:14,659 --> 01:35:16,627
I beg your forgiveness.

1241
01:35:17,895 --> 01:35:21,626
I beg your grace.
