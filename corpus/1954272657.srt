1
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:36,284
Heeyah!

2
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:38,757
Hyah!

3
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:44,957
Whoa.

4
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:53,088
<i>Hey.</i>

5
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,317
Her mother is dead.

6
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,405
You are her aunt.

7
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,693
I don't know what to do with her.

8
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,503
I'll send more each month.

9
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,038
Before you can even start to miss me,

10
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,354
I'm going to sail right up that river,

11
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,787
take you back to Africa.

12
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,529
Girls in Africa may not wear shoes...

13
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:19,911
but French girls do.

14
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:27,491
Quietly, Therese.

15
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,222
Your father isn't coming back,
Therese.

16
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,603
He'll come back.

17
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,691
My brother has never
done a single thing

18
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:09,914
he said he was going to do.

19
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,917
Therese, your cousin
needs his medicine.

20
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,746
God gives and he takes away.

21
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,499
He took away Camille's health,
but gave him you.

22
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,351
You're his guardian angel.

23
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:26,955
Boo!

24
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,960
Should you be out?

25
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,248
I escaped.

26
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,292
Kiss me, Camille.

27
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:40,522
All right.

28
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:42,811
No, not like that.

29
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:44,753
Like this?

30
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,309
No.

31
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,269
Well, how?

32
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,287
Never mind.

33
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,865
A letter came...
for you, from Africa.

34
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,956
Your father went down
off the coast of Algeria.

35
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,350
What's going
to happen to me now?

36
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:27,556
Well, there's the small pension
your father left you, perhaps.

37
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,459
Perhaps we could use that
to help find our way.

38
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,713
Oh, my son.
Oh, my God!

39
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,853
What was I thinking?

40
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,445
You should be inside.
It's damp out here.

41
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,914
I'm fine.
You're overreacting.

42
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,362
Camille has an announcement
to make.

43
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,062
We're moving to Paris.

44
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:12,347
Paris?

45
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,799
Such a filthy city.

46
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:16,234
Yes.

47
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,809
Through an old friend of mother's,
Inspector Michaud, I've found a job.

48
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:20,736
In an office.

49
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,404
A lowly clerk in a big company,
be with my own little desk.

50
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:26,565
It sounds wonderful.

51
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,269
Makes no sense to me
whatsoever.

52
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,598
I mean, how are Therese and I
supposed to look after you

53
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:31,830
if you're gone all day?

54
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,188
The doctor did say
I should exert myself more

55
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,289
and you do spoil me, mother.
He said so.

56
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,261
Oh, he's a country doctor
with one dead eye.

57
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,367
I hardly believe
that he knows what's--

58
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:40,772
I've let you coddle me all my life.

59
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,073
The least you can do is allow me
a will of my own, mother.

60
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,727
It's time I take control
of our little family.

61
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:49,531
Well...

62
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,481
I've often dreamed of having
a small shop again.

63
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,481
Ha, see? A silver lining.

64
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,976
You know, a few special lace pieces
in the window and...

65
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,030
Well, you let me take care
of everything, you naughty boy.

66
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,406
I wouldn't dream of having it
any other way, mother.

67
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,609
We can leave right after the wedding.

68
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,044
Whose wedding are we going to?

69
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:13,475
Well, yours, dear.

70
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,579
Well, but who am I going to marry?

71
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,592
Why, Camille, of course.

72
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,007
Therese...

73
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:36,032
We don't even know
who your mother was.

74
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,748
Illegitimates have been dealt
an unlucky hand.

75
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:47,475
We should consider ourselves lucky
that you have Camille.

76
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:52,453
And he is so excited.

77
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,934
Oh, and you will be Madame Raquin,
just like me.

78
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,239
In the name of
the Father and the Son

79
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,448
and the Holy Spirit.
Amen.

80
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,579
Clear the way, lad.

81
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,109
Children.

82
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,108
This way.

83
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:57,772
Set it there.

84
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,310
"I found the most wonderful shop,"
you said.

85
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,273
I saw it in the daylight.

86
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,288
"An enthralling arcade"?

87
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,920
Well, it was enthralling.

88
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,800
Therese, let the young man pass.

89
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:15,696
He has work to do.

90
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,335
It's smaller than you said, mother.

91
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,881
I adore this house.
It's our new home.

92
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:26,164
It's dark.

93
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,436
Oh, well, be fair. It's late.

94
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:31,866
When the sun streams in,

95
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,088
- it's lovely.
- It's mean.

96
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,756
Oh, don't be silly.

97
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,797
Well, I will be cooped up all day,

98
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,099
content in my new job at the office,

99
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:45,015
while you two girls will have each other
to thin the gloom.

100
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,555
Customers bustling in and out.

101
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,604
Oh, yes. Won't it be exciting?

102
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,910
And even I will admit, my dear,
that it needs a few touches.

103
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,960
Well, there were financial
limitations, of course.

104
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:01,013
I mean, but I think we can do wonders
with the place. Really.

105
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:02,407
Hmm.

106
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,969
Just get some flowers
on the windowsills,

107
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,285
and wallpaper.

108
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:11,677
Curtains, of course.
Let me show you the upstairs.

109
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:13,284
Yes.

110
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,276
- We have a generous storeroom.
- Right.

111
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,374
This one.

112
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,354
Thank you.

113
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,969
What do you do all day?

114
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:56,798
You know what I do.

115
00:13:57,102 --> 00:14:00,232
I don't. Go to the office.

116
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,296
And then I come home.

117
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,079
Are you happy?

118
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,238
Not at the office.

119
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:10,918
Where?

120
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:11,977
At the zoo.

121
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:14,322
The zoo?

122
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,397
By the end of another meaningless
column of figures,

123
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:17,899
my mind is blank.

124
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,495
Feels nice.

125
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,309
I let my feet decide the destination

126
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,001
and the rest of me
just sort of follows along.

127
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,014
Your feet decide
to go to the zoo?

128
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,243
Oh, yes. I don't know why,

129
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:31,625
but four days out of five

130
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,467
I find myself outside a cage
and I watch the bears.

131
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,365
I see.

132
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:40,636
I get to feel the ground
shuddering under my feet

133
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,550
as they move about.

134
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,494
Where's my book?

135
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,409
Oh, I must have left it downstairs.

136
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,515
I'm too tired to read tonight.

137
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,479
<i>Hey.</i>

138
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,911
I might be a bear.

139
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:09,994
But you're not.

140
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,144
You're my little Therese.

141
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,649
- Candied grapefruit peel?
- No.

142
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,652
Camille is never this late.

143
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,378
Mother!

144
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,211
Finally.

145
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,164
I'll return in a moment.

146
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,209
And no cheating.

147
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:47,682
Therese.

148
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,522
Camille! Where have you been?
You've--

149
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,912
Ta-da! I brought you a present.

150
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,751
Imported from your
long-lost past in Vernon.

151
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:59,183
Oh.

152
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,658
You don't remember him.

153
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,000
- Do I?
- It's Laurent.

154
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,699
You must remember Laurent!

155
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:07,627
His father owned the dairy
beyond the church.

156
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,303
Oh, my! Yes!

157
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,109
Oh, my!
Little Laurent.

158
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:14,832
Yes!

159
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,570
Oh!

160
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:17,809
This is before you came
to live with us.

161
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,477
Oh, so long ago.

162
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:23,436
When I was a girl,
a summer day was just...

163
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,376
Now, mother, let's not get started
on summer days

164
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:26,918
or we'll die of hunger.

165
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:28,239
Can you feed this great ox?

166
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,690
Well, yes, of course I can.

167
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,583
Oh, little Laurent.

168
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:33,885
You can stay, can't you?

169
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,739
I would love to stay, thank you.

170
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,465
He works for the company, too,
and we never even knew.

171
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:39,026
Oh, my.

172
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,031
So I thought why not?
I'll bring him along to Dominoes Night.

173
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,270
Oh, well, that's perfect.

174
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:44,404
Thursday evenings here
are always so exciting.

175
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:47,023
- Yes.
- I mean, the banter,

176
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:49,053
especially Inspector Michaud.

177
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:50,988
And his son Olivier.
He's fantastic.

178
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,243
Come, come, come, come!
You must meet everyone.

179
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:54,605
Oh, I will.

180
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,727
Therese, put the lights out, dear.

181
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,170
Good evening.

182
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:02,603
Welcome, Laurent.

183
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,318
- Mr. Olivier.
- Good evening.

184
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:05,996
This is my wife Suzanne.

185
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,555
Here you go, my friend.

186
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,700
Ah, Inspector.
Very good to meet you.

187
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,326
Ah!

188
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:19,977
- Very nice.
- Well done.

189
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,470
Would you open a window, Therese?

190
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,742
I keep smelling an odor,
like gas.

191
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,435
It's probably me.

192
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,036
Oh, no, certainly not.

193
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,428
Yes. Owing to an investigation,

194
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,130
which I'm not at liberty to discuss,

195
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:35,986
I had to go to the morgue today.

196
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,931
It was, uh, rather warm.

197
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,295
The aroma clings.

198
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:43,743
I seem to be having
the slightest attack of the vapors.

199
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,183
Excuse me.

200
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:48,843
Therese.

201
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,598
Don't bother. She won't be long.

202
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:54,982
Grapefruit peel?

203
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,450
Oh, yes, thank you.

204
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,667
When I was a young police officer
like my son here,

205
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,133
I wouldn't go down
to the morgue at all.

206
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:04,629
I had to draw a line.

207
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,077
Send me into the nearest
den of thieves, unarmed.

208
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:12,464
I've been to the morgue myself,
a number of times.

209
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:17,103
What for? On a bet?

210
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,779
No, no, no, not at all.
With my artist friends.

211
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,252
You didn't paint, did you?

212
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:23,688
I'm afraid I did.

213
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,580
While my father paid my way
in the hugely mistaken assumption

214
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,887
that I was grooming myself
for the law.

215
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,035
Were you good?

216
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,386
No, not at all.
But I liked the life.

217
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,272
By "life" you must mean--

218
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,454
He said life, he meant the life.

219
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,490
Let's leave it at that.

220
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,252
But why the morgue?

221
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:44,627
Well, we'd stand at the public rail
with pad in hand and sketch the bodies.

222
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,380
Wasn't there a supply of,
uh, warmer models?

223
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:48,646
Obviously not.

224
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,624
So why did you
hang up your brush?

225
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:54,596
Well, my--my father came
to my garret one day

226
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:58,574
and my model opened the door
as she was and my father

227
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,041
was so shocked that
he took a step backwards

228
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,280
and fell down
three flights of steps.

229
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,467
Was he hurt?

230
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:07,855
Oh not a bit, but I was.

231
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,137
By the time he hit bottom,

232
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,554
he'd cut me off completely
without a sou.

233
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:12,884
Hmm.

234
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,172
I haven't spoken
to the old skinflint since.

235
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,317
You weren't prepared to starve
for your art?

236
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,909
Do I look like a man
who would starve for his art?

237
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,220
I couldn't say you do.

238
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,059
No.

239
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,048
- Therese.
- I have to open a window.

240
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:37,247
- Why? What's wrong?
- Nothing. The air is close.

241
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:38,723
Won't you come
and join us at the table?

242
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:39,971
No. My head is splitting.

243
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:41,735
Laurent will think you don't like him.

244
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,870
I don't.

245
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:46,637
Might have a think about that.

246
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,695
He smells like an animal.
I can smell him from here.

247
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,697
Don't be ridiculous.

248
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:53,196
Oh, Grivet, you've won again!

249
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:00,669
I've tried, but I just can't imagine it.

250
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:02,693
What?

251
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,375
Standing there with palette
and brush in hand

252
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:07,827
while a woman takes off her clothes.

253
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,760
Can't you?

254
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,008
Therese!

255
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:12,206
I wouldn't know where to look.

256
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,446
There are dozens of places.

257
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,345
My hand would shake.

258
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:19,854
- Therese!
- Should you not see

259
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,352
- what she wants?
- Don't move.

260
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:22,867
Sorry.

261
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:26,055
A customer probably wandered
into the shop by mistake.

262
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:28,552
I'd be hypnotized.

263
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,871
The model is hypnotized, too.

264
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,826
Do you look at her face?

265
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,785
Mm-hmm.
And I look at her body.

266
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,273
I listen and try to hear
what the body is saying.

267
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,319
"I have to go wee"?

268
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,289
Yeah, maybe.

269
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,338
The body says other things.

270
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:51,655
"Love me," I suppose.

271
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,210
The first model I ever had
was this beautiful redhead.

272
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:59,575
Natural red,
as I quickly discovered.

273
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,845
With the only hitch being
that this wonderful creature

274
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:04,262
was deaf as a brick.

275
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:05,379
Hmm.

276
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,881
Couldn't call out if I wanted
adjustments. I had to...

277
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:11,371
mold her like a sculptor,

278
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,605
Part by part.

279
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:20,972
One afternoon,
I wanted her legs to be a bit wider.

280
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,847
So I went to move her knees apart
with my hands,

281
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:26,957
but my touch was clumsy.

282
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:32,114
And then, on a hunch,

283
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:36,055
I touched the inside of her thigh

284
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,452
with the tip of my brush...

285
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:49,716
where the skin is soft as cream,
and warm.

286
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,392
Lightest touch of camel's hair.

287
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,434
Did she make the small move
you were after?

288
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,970
She did.

289
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,235
And what was her body
saying to you?

290
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:09,987
"Brush me again."

291
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:13,907
Did Madame call?

292
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:16,482
Yes. Five minutes ago.

293
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:20,514
Is it done?

294
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,146
It's a painting, Madame,
not a roast.

295
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,798
Great art takes time, mother.

296
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:26,724
Just one small peek.

297
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,682
Ah! Can't be done.

298
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,917
Oh, but I could be called away
to heaven before it's completed.

299
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:33,971
No, I doubt it, Madame.

300
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,749
My guess is you'll see us
all snug in our graves.

301
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,406
What a horrible thought.

302
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:43,994
Mother, I'm posing.

303
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:46,789
Oh, so handsome.

304
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,279
Therese. Now.

305
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:51,966
Don't move.

306
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:55,528
I've painted your shadow
into the picture.

307
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,326
Therese, I need
my hot water bottle.

308
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,362
My feet are freezing.

309
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,330
Therese, honestly,
I wonder your head is.

310
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:13,654
You're not even listening.

311
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,460
Could you come up here, please?

312
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,540
Hmm.

313
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:29,674
I look--

314
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,282
is "distinguished" the word?

315
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:34,808
It's a word.

316
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:35,967
Thank you.

317
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:38,211
But it barely resembles you.

318
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,923
It's so blue.

319
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,091
And so...gray.

320
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,127
It resembles my soul, mother.

321
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,416
Oh.

322
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:52,234
Is that what you were after,
his soul?

323
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,578
I paint what I see, Madame.

324
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,486
It does grow on one.

325
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:01,315
So does mange.

326
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,760
Oh, no, don't belittle yourself.

327
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:05,618
You've given us a glimpse
of something...

328
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,482
eternal.

329
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:11,564
Oh, no, not a customer now.

330
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,293
Let me go out and get a bottle
of champagne to celebrate.

331
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,488
- Yes.
- No, no, no!

332
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:15,653
- Two bottles.
- Yes!

333
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:18,157
And then we can come back here
and marvel at Laurent's masterpiece.

334
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,140
- But hurry.
- Of course.

335
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:28,602
Marvelous.

336
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,377
It really is an extraordinary thing.

337
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,147
Thank you, dear friend.

338
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,880
Do you like it?

339
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,240
You said you couldn't paint.

340
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:57,764
Unbutton your blouse.

341
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:04,591
We don't have time.

342
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,560
Am I hurting you?

343
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:30,851
Yes.

344
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:35,215
Don't moan.

345
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,921
Don't make a sound.
Keep quiet.

346
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:05,254
Well, you're busy as a little bee
this morning.

347
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,540
I slept very well last night.

348
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:12,141
- Buzz, buzz, buzz.
- Buzz, buzz, buzz.

349
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:30,381
There?

350
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:34,398
Show me where.

351
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:37,884
Show me where.

352
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:41,039
Ah. There. Right there?

353
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:49,853
Tomorrow. Don't be late.

354
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:51,071
Yes.

355
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,765
Therese? I need you.

356
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:32,685
Well, um, I'll save them
both for you,

357
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:35,428
and you can stop in once
you've given it some thought.

358
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,637
Oh, that's what I'll do.
Thank you.

359
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:57,855
Boo!

360
00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:59,813
Jesus, Camille,
you scared the hell out of me.

361
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,258
Will you join me for some lunch?

362
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:03,596
- Um, uh...
- It's not a difficult question.

363
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,795
I'm sorry. The head clerk needs me
to run an errand for him.

364
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,054
Oh. Will I see you tonight?

365
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:09,713
- Tonight?
- It's Thursday.

366
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,101
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
I'll see you tonight.

367
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,510
I'm sorry, I'm late, Camille.

368
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:17,773
Come over whenever you want.
You're family now.

369
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:43,707
Your marriage bed?

370
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:46,439
Madame could come up here
at any minute.

371
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,591
Oh, she wouldn't dream
of leaving the shop.

372
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,170
Besides, I have a terrible headache
and need to rest.

373
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,073
You're afraid.

374
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,320
I can't believe that you're
the same lifeless girl

375
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:14,244
who always sat in a corner.

376
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,550
You have no idea how much
they've stolen from me.

377
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:22,535
I almost ran away twice.

378
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,267
But she always told me
I couldn't survive without them.

379
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,312
And I believed her.

380
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:31,961
There is nothing left of me

381
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,590
but a bit of burnt wick

382
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:39,104
and a wisp of smoke.

383
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:42,212
And look at you now.

384
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:45,692
So don't be afraid.

385
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:50,535
Danger passes by those
who look it right in the eye.

386
00:29:57,695 --> 00:30:01,065
He still had her blood
under his fingernails

387
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:02,486
when we found him.

388
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:03,924
Oh--

389
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,323
Excuse me.

390
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:09,423
Therese.

391
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:11,107
She won't be long.

392
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:12,962
Thou shalt not.

393
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,741
Is it the sixth or the seventh?

394
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,859
- The seventh.
- The sixth

395
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:18,738
and the seventh.

396
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:22,154
There is nothing but murder
and lust.

397
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:25,551
To be stuffed into her own oven.

398
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,727
Hacked to bloody pieces
and baked in a pie.

399
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:34,384
Therese.

400
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,626
It's your move.

401
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:38,995
Oh.

402
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:44,541
Oh, now.

403
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,226
I had no idea you were such
a skillful player, Therese.

404
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,635
It's always the quiet ones
in the corner

405
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:52,238
that you have to keep an eye on.

406
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,530
I can't stand not being with you.

407
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:01,912
Therese?

408
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,923
Oh, for God's sake.

409
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:05,375
Therese, are you ill?

410
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:07,653
I have a terrible migraine,
Madame.

411
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,176
Well, would you like a cup of tea?

412
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:13,322
Maybe later. I need to rest.

413
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:14,798
Hmm.

414
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:21,751
You like to lie.

415
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,740
I do.
And I'm good at it.

416
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,890
They made me better.

417
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,862
Thank you for locking me up
in a sickroom.

418
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:31,785
Shh.

419
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:34,673
And thank you
for burying me alive.

420
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:38,619
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Oh, thank you.

421
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:48,246
Therese, is the cat
coughing up furballs again?

422
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:05,622
What's wrong?

423
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,869
You dug me up too late.

424
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,433
No.

425
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,966
No. Just in time.

426
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,715
Just in time.

427
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,372
Save me.

428
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:29,635
Please save me.

429
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,539
- Shh.
- I was sinking.

430
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,930
I was sinking into
something cold and deep.

431
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,020
I couldn't breathe.

432
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:08,495
You were dreaming.

433
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,008
What are you doing?

434
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,933
Listening to the river.

435
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,149
That's just a brick wall, Therese.

436
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,108
Hmm.

437
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:26,585
Do you often sit up alone at night?

438
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,741
Sometimes.

439
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,014
You have secrets from me.

440
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:34,014
I didn't know.

441
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,051
Sometimes at night
I sit up at the window.

442
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,188
That's all.

443
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:42,856
Well, come back to bed.

444
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,147
I want to hold you.

445
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:45,352
I never dream when I hold you.

446
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,022
I hated you.

447
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,331
You hated me?

448
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,461
Before you ever touched me.

449
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,588
I used to walk into a room,

450
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:15,097
and I'd see you there

451
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,390
and you'd barely look up.

452
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:23,357
I'd find myself moving around
and around your chair,

453
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:28,349
hoping that a small part of my dress

454
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,960
or my hand might touch you.

455
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,130
Do you still hate me?

456
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,140
Yes.

457
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,355
Why?

458
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,268
Because you can leave me.

459
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:49,723
But I won't.

460
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:54,631
I promise.

461
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:58,982
I promise.

462
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:04,176
I promise.

463
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:08,637
Camille! What are we doing?

464
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,947
Come to see my bear.

465
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:13,512
Why?

466
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,495
Last week there was a young boy
here with a crust of bread

467
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:18,591
that he'd spread with honey.

468
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,680
He threw it
but his aim was bad.

469
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,192
The bread hit the bear on the back
and it stuck there.

470
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,491
Poor thing could smell the honey,
but he couldn't quite reach it.

471
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,140
The bear went crazy.

472
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:33,956
The poor thing mauled itself.

473
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:37,209
Why dwell on it?
It's sad.

474
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:39,272
Come on, let's go.

475
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:43,346
I don't know how
to make Therese happy.

476
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:49,859
Isn't she happy?

477
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,753
I don't even know
how to tell anymore.

478
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,813
Just love her, Camille.

479
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:05,131
It just seemed so much easier
back in Vernon.

480
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,540
Just love her.

481
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:09,823
See if she comes around.

482
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:12,372
Come on, let's go.

483
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,896
I want to fall asleep in your arms.

484
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:03,409
I wish that could happen.

485
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:08,073
I want to touch your body
while you sleep.

486
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:13,864
I want to wake up
with your tongue inside me.

487
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:15,882
Therese.

488
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:18,383
Therese, I made you
some chamomile tea.

489
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:20,036
Go. Get under my skirts.

490
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:24,347
Therese?

491
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:25,542
Open your legs.

492
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,740
- No.
- I can't breathe.

493
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:27,771
I don't care.

494
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:31,657
Were you dozing, dear?

495
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,276
I thought I heard you muttering.

496
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:35,879
Maybe I was.
I don't remember.

497
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:37,997
- Tea?
- Yes, please.

498
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:41,079
How's your head?
Still agonizing?

499
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:43,305
It comes and goes.

500
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:45,394
Perhaps I should rub your neck.

501
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,193
Oh, you know,
I don't think that's--

502
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:49,671
Oh, it always helped
when you were small.

503
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,911
You know, you've had
so many headaches lately.

504
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,337
Perhaps we should
talk to the doctor.

505
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:58,951
I need you by my side, dear,
down in the shop.

506
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:05,721
My brother was an officer

507
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:08,184
He went away to sea

508
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:11,696
He met someone,
somewhere, somehow

509
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:15,033
And brought you home to me

510
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,015
- Is that better?
- Oh, yes.

511
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,083
Thank you.

512
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,450
You should start getting packing
material from Fragnet's shop.

513
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:34,373
What for?

514
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,122
We're moving back to Vernon.

515
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:44,911
What?

516
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:48,879
Paris is so bad for my health.
All the filth and soot.

517
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:52,657
But your job, the shop?

518
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,690
Both easily replaced in Vernon.

519
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:00,222
Camille, Camille.

520
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:03,556
When were you going
to discuss this with me?

521
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:05,505
I like Paris.

522
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:09,501
Well, Mother says you've been getting
terrible migraines every afternoon,

523
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,504
so it's better for you, too.

524
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,599
The air is much cleaner in Vernon.

525
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:15,444
God, what's gotten into you?

526
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:19,199
I'm the husband.

527
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:21,951
I make the decisions.

528
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:25,299
Yeah, but we have friends here
and our business.

529
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,293
Therese!

530
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:28,861
I'm not asking you.

531
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:30,887
I'm telling you.

532
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,110
We will live out our lives together

533
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,958
away from this filthy city
and all will be fine.

534
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:51,263
Therese, it's time for bed.

535
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:58,598
Therese?

536
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:00,664
Yes?

537
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:01,951
What are you doing?

538
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:05,984
Uh...
Uh, checking that the door is locked.

539
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,460
Go to bed this instant.
It's late.

540
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:25,955
Good evening,
Monsieur Jeanneau.

541
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:39,631
Oh, I can't live without you
any longer.

542
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,576
If only he'd go away.

543
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,698
Well, people don't just go away.

544
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:58,451
Sometimes they do.

545
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:04,717
But it's...

546
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:06,492
it's dangerous for...

547
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,346
people they leave behind.

548
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:15,187
Not if the going away
is an accident.

549
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:21,689
People have accidents
every day and...

550
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:25,713
sometimes they
just don't come back.

551
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:31,597
That's all.

552
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:42,875
I have to go.

553
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,039
Therese.

554
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:50,135
Do I own you?

555
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,580
Completely.

556
00:41:57,781 --> 00:41:58,801
Do I own you?

557
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:04,141
Yes. Yes.

558
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:32,772
For you.

559
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,912
They're supposed to go
into water, Therese.

560
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:47,091
Oh, and don't tell mother.
She'll be jealous.

561
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:03,322
Feels like summer's nearly over.

562
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:06,628
The leaves will be falling
before we know it.

563
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,394
Why does that happen?

564
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:09,829
Listen.

565
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,670
What?

566
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:13,722
I hear water.

567
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,021
Ah. Maybe it's the leaves
drifting down.

568
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,147
It's the river,
beyond those trees over there.

569
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:22,853
Oh, why don't we rent a boat
and row out into the sunset?

570
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,484
Just-just let me
sit down for a moment.

571
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:28,431
Are you tired?

572
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:30,782
Oh, I'm exhausted.

573
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,078
I couldn't have trudged
another step.

574
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:35,727
Just let me catch up
with a couple of winks.

575
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:38,597
Therese.

576
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:43,085
Notice this, Laurent.

577
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:48,042
If you get married, you'll find yourself
with a portable pillow.

578
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:50,842
Don't flaunt your good fortune,
my friend.

579
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:55,033
Oh, we must have
walked 20 miles.

580
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,046
Maybe two.

581
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:00,776
I'm getting old.

582
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:03,502
What an odd thought.

583
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:14,097
Are you warm enough?

584
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:18,117
Camille?

585
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,161
Camille?

586
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,863
Shh.

587
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:27,390
Don't.

588
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:29,271
I have to touch you.

589
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:49,445
Oh, my God.

590
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,740
I know.

591
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:51,781
No, you don't know.

592
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,422
There, clomping through the leaves.

593
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:56,446
Isn't that Therese?

594
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:58,837
Oh, look.
It's Laurent and Therese.

595
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,573
- Hello.
- Laurent!

596
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:02,902
One, one boat.

597
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:06,089
Shh.

598
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:07,386
Oh. Sorry.

599
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:08,461
Is he sick?

600
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,456
Oh, no.
He's napping.

601
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:12,041
- Oh.
- On the damp ground?

602
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:13,572
His mother would have a heart attack.

603
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,747
I won't tell if you won't.

604
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:18,396
What happened to your foot?

605
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:20,049
Oh. A blister.

606
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:21,750
I got one, too.

607
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:23,866
I told you this walk was too far.

608
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:26,214
Well, we're leaving now,
aren't we, darling?

609
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:28,843
Without doing the single thing
we came to do.

610
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:31,573
If you want to rent a boat, Suzanne,

611
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:34,549
and row out into the fading light,
be my guest.

612
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:36,492
I'm going home.

613
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,980
Good afternoon.

614
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:39,998
Can I tell you something, Therese?

615
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,620
All men are pigs.

616
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,125
Why can't you two
be civil to one another?

617
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:48,177
She wants to go on a boat.

618
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:54,561
Wait! Olivier, please!
Wait for me!

619
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:56,589
Will you control your temper?

620
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,150
Have a good afternoon.

621
00:45:58,455 --> 00:46:00,645
I was ready to go
in the boat this Sunday,

622
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:04,131
but somebody had taken their time
choosing the right dress.

623
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:06,715
Let's have a lovely walk
by the river.

624
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,770
We should go.

625
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:12,498
- Where?
- Back.

626
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,292
To what?

627
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:23,399
I'd never make a sailor.

628
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,670
Go easy.

629
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:25,878
Want to know why?
I'm terrified of water.

630
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:27,490
Don't be such a baby.

631
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:30,258
If God had intended us
to conquer the waves,

632
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:32,494
he'd have fitted us with pontoons
instead of feet.

633
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:35,000
Look, just sit down.
Don't stand in the boat.

634
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:37,773
Sit.

635
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:45,067
When we were little,
remember, Therese,

636
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,539
you'd make me play that game.
Remember?

637
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,470
We'd sit in our room
and the sun would go down,

638
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:54,745
and you'd say,
"Don't light a candle yet."

639
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,770
The light would fade.

640
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:00,361
But we could still just
make out things in the room--

641
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,658
the table, the rug, the vase.

642
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:05,768
Then they lost their color.

643
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:07,293
Then their edges.

644
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:09,966
Therese?

645
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,520
When it was completely dark...

646
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:12,819
Get in the boat.

647
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:16,967
It'd feel like there was almost
someone else with us there in the room.

648
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:20,731
I wanted to strike a match,
but you called me a baby.

649
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,055
- Remember?
- I love you.

650
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:32,170
Well, at least I'm not afraid of boats,
like some babies I could mention.

651
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:25,479
Is there anything as depressingly calm
as a Sunday afternoon?

652
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,167
Camille!

653
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:29,518
Man over!

654
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,910
Camille! I have to go back in!

655
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:33,266
- Laurent!
- Camille?

656
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:34,407
Laurent.

657
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,339
Oh, my goodness!

658
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,011
My dear! What's wrong?

659
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:41,483
I have to save him!
Camille!

660
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:43,662
Therese, shh.
Therese, shh. Therese.

661
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:08,549
I told him to stop dancing round
in the boat.

662
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:13,853
I told him.
And then the boat tipped over.

663
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:16,918
You did all
that was humanly possible.

664
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:19,181
She's got a fever.

665
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,644
He kept shouting,
"Save my Therese."

666
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,982
You die just like that,
in the twinkle of an eye.

667
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:29,955
Horrible, just horrible.

668
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:33,331
A report will have to be filed.

669
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:36,134
Certainly someone saw something.

670
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,270
And they will find the body.

671
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:47,837
No, wait here.

672
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:49,721
You've been through enough
today, dear boy.

673
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,630
I'll take over now.

674
00:51:04,961 --> 00:51:07,241
I should go to Madame.

675
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:20,178
We have a long way to go.

676
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:23,845
You can never leave me now.

677
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,977
Be strong.

678
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:35,748
I think you should come in now.

679
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:40,138
No, no, no, no, no!

680
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:44,167
- Shh, shh.
- Oh, no, no!

681
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:56,690
Therese,
Madame needs you now.

682
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:02,562
Oh, no. Oh, no.

683
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:06,320
I miss my boy!
I miss my boy!

684
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:13,014
No, no, no, no!

685
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:22,723
Oh, no, no, no!

686
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:25,367
My boy!

687
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:28,132
- Shh, shh, shh.
- I miss my boy!

688
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:31,102
Oh, no!

689
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:35,014
<i>Anima eius et animae omnius</i>

690
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:37,575
<i>fidelium defunctorum</i>

691
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:42,841
<i>per misericordiam def
requiescant in pace.</i>

692
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:44,413
Amen.

693
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:46,674
Amen.

694
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:53,435
I'm so sorry, Madame.
I'm so sorry.

695
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,431
I'd do it all again if I had to.

696
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:06,602
I love you.

697
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,340
Therese, please, let me do it.

698
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:30,442
No, I want to keep busy.

699
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:45,785
I see him sometimes
breaking the surface.

700
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:47,963
Have some tea, Madame.

701
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:49,211
Swelling and...

702
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:52,251
bursting apart.

703
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,300
Madame, I beg you.

704
00:55:56,786 --> 00:55:58,016
And other times...

705
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:10,239
Other times,
I see the boat tipping

706
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:13,454
and I see him falling.

707
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:18,327
And then I see him
swimming away.

708
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:22,695
Flopping up onto a bank,
exhausted but happy.

709
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:26,244
And I wonder,

710
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:30,999
why couldn't it be that way?

711
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:39,955
Tea, Madame.

712
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:44,038
Have my son bring it to me.

713
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:02,955
Therese.

714
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:11,802
Madame, you should come inside.

715
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:14,225
Shh.

716
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:23,314
You did this.

717
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:25,043
No. I don't know what you mean.

718
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:27,155
You, you took your eyes off of him.

719
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:29,094
You weren't watching.

720
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,816
You were supposed to be
his guardian angel!

721
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,212
Madame, accidents
happen every day.

722
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:39,007
When the boat tipped over,
how did you survive?

723
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:42,716
How did you survive

724
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:46,219
while my child sank down
into the blackness?

725
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:47,723
What were you doing?

726
00:57:47,997 --> 00:57:49,227
Tell me, tell me.

727
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:51,582
Oh, God, tell me!
What were you doing?

728
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:53,671
Madame, I tried.

729
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:55,237
No, you didn't.

730
00:57:56,439 --> 00:57:57,579
You let him die.

731
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:03,283
How did you manage to live

732
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,690
and not him?

733
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:07,342
How?

734
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:11,160
He should be standing
right here beside me.

735
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:14,888
Not you, not you, not you!

736
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:17,649
Not you!

737
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:21,600
Not you!

738
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:31,202
Madame. Shh.

739
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,030
Shh.

740
00:58:37,947 --> 00:58:41,317
Therese. Oh, my..
Oh, my baby girl.

741
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:44,168
I didn't mean those things I said.

742
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:46,051
I didn't mean...

743
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:49,489
Something has reached inside...

744
00:58:52,428 --> 00:58:54,918
and destroyed my heart
and my mind.

745
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,230
Oh, my sweet girl.

746
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:49,727
Is she sleeping?

747
00:59:51,854 --> 00:59:53,814
Yes.

748
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:56,003
Perhaps we should leave.

749
00:59:57,527 --> 00:59:58,637
Please stay.

750
01:00:00,363 --> 01:00:03,433
We, uh, we weren't sure
whether to come here

751
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,960
even after you invited us.

752
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:09,529
But it's been so long
and we've missed your at-homes.

753
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,006
Well, she's missed them, too.

754
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,324
Please, stay.

755
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:27,438
I had to be near you.

756
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:30,404
Near whom, Therese?
Did you say something?

757
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:33,033
No, mother.

758
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:35,393
You must have been dreaming.

759
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:40,899
How long...

760
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:44,279
does it take to drown?

761
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:49,673
To sink down into the murk,
how long?

762
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:54,269
It's very late.

763
01:00:54,517 --> 01:00:55,717
We've worn you down.

764
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:57,069
<i>Oh, no, no.</i>

765
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:58,717
No.

766
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:01,932
I'm thankful for that.

767
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:04,108
- And please do come again soon.
- Madame.

768
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:08,444
You must try not to imagine
Camille in bits and pieces.

769
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:13,454
How should I imagine him?

770
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:17,021
Gone, just gone.

771
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:19,755
Gone?

772
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:23,020
We'll see ourselves out.

773
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:29,207
Just gone.

774
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:36,040
If I make grief an inconvenience.

775
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:38,189
Perhaps it pains them
to see you suffer.

776
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:40,795
You have a kind heart

777
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:42,997
Oh, it's nothing, Madame.

778
01:01:43,399 --> 01:01:45,329
No.

779
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:49,985
No, it's not nothing.

780
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:54,017
It's comfort, Laurent,
and you give it gladly.

781
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:02,383
Lock up the shop as you leave.

782
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,239
Of course.

783
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:15,015
Therese, I need you.

784
01:03:26,235 --> 01:03:28,225
Don't...Don't ever do that
to me again.

785
01:03:29,772 --> 01:03:32,382
Therese. I can't sleep.

786
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:35,015
I haven't slept in months.
Let me come to your room tonight.

787
01:03:35,878 --> 01:03:38,128
No. No, we have to wait.

788
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,230
Why did We kill him?

789
01:03:45,555 --> 01:03:47,545
- To be together.
- Exactly.

790
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:54,014
I can't sleep. I keep having
nightmares about it.

791
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:58,775
Darling, as soon as we're married

792
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:01,488
and sleep in the same bed together,

793
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:03,488
all of the nightmares will stop.

794
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,270
Let's just leave.
We'll leave tonight.

795
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:06,838
- I don't care where we go.
- Therese. Stop.

796
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:10,164
If we left right now,
we'd go straight to the guillotine.

797
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:14,780
Soon. We'll have each other
and the shop.

798
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:17,168
Oh, I don't care about the shop.

799
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:19,803
Well, you should care about
the shop. It's yours now.

800
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:23,573
I don't know, Laurent.
Everything is in her name.

801
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,790
Nothing was in his name,
not even a bank account.

802
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:27,983
What?

803
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:30,224
Yes. Nothing.

804
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:38,038
Can you grieve a little more?

805
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:45,682
Therese, have you
made any tea?

806
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:53,111
Therese, what is that sound?

807
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:57,522
Therese?

808
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:03,234
Therese?

809
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:10,826
Oh!

810
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:12,593
- Suzanne.
- My, you scared me!

811
01:05:12,942 --> 01:05:15,462
Just making sure all the doors
were locked up tight.

812
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,390
I never realized the shop
had a side door.

813
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:22,505
Hmm. Both doors are secure.

814
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:27,938
It's heartbreaking.
Just heartbreaking.

815
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:29,621
Mmm. Perhaps we should
just let them be.

816
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:31,096
I should help.

817
01:05:31,394 --> 01:05:34,414
It's a beautiful evening.
Let me walk you home.

818
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:38,145
Um...

819
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:39,551
We'll take the long way.

820
01:05:41,971 --> 01:05:42,841
Yes.

821
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:48,880
How sick is Therese?

822
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:50,695
I beg your pardon?

823
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:53,067
She's as white as
a slab of marble, Madame.

824
01:05:53,482 --> 01:05:55,412
Her eyes are empty,
her skin is dull,

825
01:05:55,818 --> 01:05:57,898
and either she's sick
as a dog or...

826
01:05:58,321 --> 01:05:59,111
Or what?

827
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:01,195
Or she's sick of lying alone
in an empty bed.

828
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:02,670
Father!

829
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:04,732
Well, wouldn't you be?

830
01:06:05,061 --> 01:06:07,691
I only wonder if anyone
even remembers.

831
01:06:08,197 --> 01:06:09,927
Remembers what, Madame?

832
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:15,309
That I had a son who died
just eight months ago.

833
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:18,068
But shouldn't Therese move on?

834
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:19,764
Well, of course she should.

835
01:06:24,613 --> 01:06:26,983
I don't..I don't know.

836
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:28,850
It's as if she's fading away.

837
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:30,735
Madame, I've seen
many things in my life,

838
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:32,667
and I can tell you
with absolute certainty

839
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:34,602
that that woman is dying
of a broken heart.

840
01:06:36,692 --> 01:06:39,212
From a bleeding wound
that never heals.

841
01:06:40,563 --> 01:06:41,993
Marriage is the cure.

842
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:43,941
Marriage?

843
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:51,099
No. Oh, no, no, no, no.
That's not possible, no.

844
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:57,219
- Who would she marry?
- Who else but Laurent?

845
01:07:00,816 --> 01:07:02,276
Oh.

846
01:07:05,988 --> 01:07:08,328
More respectful
to Camille's memory

847
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:10,401
than were she to marry
a stranger.

848
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:12,873
A stranger?

849
01:07:14,663 --> 01:07:18,563
Oh, no. No.

850
01:07:19,835 --> 01:07:21,765
No, not--not a stranger.

851
01:07:23,739 --> 01:07:28,099
Not at this late chapter in my life.
A stranger?

852
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,190
They're watching us.

853
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:46,578
Do you miss me?

854
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:48,343
Yes.

855
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:52,263
That's not very convincing.

856
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:56,725
Well, sometimes at night
when I'm afraid, I miss you then.

857
01:07:57,373 --> 01:07:58,543
Only sometimes?

858
01:07:58,841 --> 01:07:59,801
Well, sometimes...

859
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:02,560
I lie in my great big bed

860
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:05,215
completely alone
for the first time in my life and...

861
01:08:06,382 --> 01:08:07,612
I feel like a little girl again.

862
01:08:12,321 --> 01:08:14,461
Once we're married
it'll be like it used to be.

863
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:17,852
Have you taken a mistress?

864
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:22,190
No.

865
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:25,349
I can smell her from here.

866
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:30,594
What does she look like?

867
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:35,880
She looks like you.

868
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:39,216
- But it's over.
- Really? Why?

869
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:42,129
Because I couldn't
remember her name.

870
01:08:42,485 --> 01:08:45,145
I'd be dreaming and I'd whisper
your name in her ear.

871
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:46,474
Does she have red hair?

872
01:08:46,722 --> 01:08:47,482
Therese.

873
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:54,749
With the love and support
of our dear friends,

874
01:08:56,599 --> 01:08:57,889
I'm ready to discuss
your marriage.

875
01:08:58,601 --> 01:08:59,741
Marriage, mother?

876
01:09:01,036 --> 01:09:02,616
But to..to whom?

877
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:07,908
But I love Laurent as a brother.

878
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:11,987
I happily accept, Madame,
if Therese will have me.

879
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:22,967
Camille slipped from these hands.

880
01:09:25,194 --> 01:09:27,124
I will never let that happen to you.

881
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:31,335
Ever.

882
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:53,443
Amen.

883
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:10,119
Since Therese is the last
of our family,

884
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:13,806
I have decided to change my will

885
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:16,596
and put it in both of your names.

886
01:10:18,013 --> 01:10:21,413
Upon my passing,
you will receive the shop

887
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:24,597
and 20,000 francs.

888
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:29,307
That's hardly a fortune,
but it will be yours.

889
01:10:30,025 --> 01:10:34,805
Bound by a tie more powerful
than love money.

890
01:10:35,598 --> 01:10:37,028
Shall we go celebrate?

891
01:10:54,216 --> 01:10:56,766
Madame's really outdone herself
with our room.

892
01:10:57,253 --> 01:11:00,443
New sheets, fresh flowers.

893
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:06,217
Therese.

894
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:14,111
Oh. Madame has..

895
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:16,086
- Take it down.
- It's only a painting.

896
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:18,218
If it's only a painting,
why are we whispering?

897
01:11:28,884 --> 01:11:30,584
That scar on your neck.

898
01:11:33,222 --> 01:11:34,832
It was bright red today
at the church.

899
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:36,390
Was it?

900
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:37,982
Mmm. How did you...

901
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:39,664
Don't.

902
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:47,571
We've dreamt of this moment
for so long

903
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:50,773
and now the dream's come true.

904
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:56,317
Remember you said that you wanted
to fall asleep in my arms?

905
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:59,546
And then wake up with me
warm beside you?

906
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:01,975
Did I?

907
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:04,886
Yes.

908
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:06,477
And now we can.

909
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:08,463
Now that Camille is gone...

910
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:10,127
Oh, no!
Why did you say his name?

911
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:11,249
What?

912
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:12,423
You say it.

913
01:12:12,695 --> 01:12:13,485
Oh, I can't.

914
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:14,989
Therese, say it!

915
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:19,791
Camille.

916
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:22,000
See? What happened?

917
01:12:22,237 --> 01:12:23,137
Nothing.

918
01:12:23,405 --> 01:12:26,035
Nothing.
Why?

919
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:30,903
Because he's gone.
He's dead.

920
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:34,647
Camille? Camille?

921
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:42,148
How badly did he die?

922
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:55,169
You didn't see?

923
01:12:57,873 --> 01:12:59,683
I closed my eyes.

924
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:02,537
When?

925
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:04,162
Stop it!
You're tickling me!

926
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:06,481
No!

927
01:13:11,253 --> 01:13:13,123
I was gentle, Therese.

928
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:17,004
I lowered him into the water
like it was a bath.

929
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,093
Show me how.

930
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:25,703
He didn't fight?

931
01:13:26,034 --> 01:13:27,674
No he was quiet
like it was bath time.

932
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:28,996
Show me.

933
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:39,509
Don't lie to me.
He didn't go gently, did he?

934
01:13:39,982 --> 01:13:41,622
I closed my eyes.
I couldn't close my ears.

935
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:43,684
- Shh, shh, shh.
- I heard him call my name.

936
01:13:44,052 --> 01:13:44,982
Therese!

937
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:47,088
Therese!

938
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:50,174
Therese!

939
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:51,762
- Therese!
- Shh! Stop it!

940
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:00,401
Stop it.

941
01:14:41,877 --> 01:14:43,337
Do you know what tonight is?

942
01:14:44,947 --> 01:14:46,617
I'd almost forgotten.

943
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:52,843
It's our wedding night.

944
01:14:56,124 --> 01:14:58,874
We were married the moment
I stepped into that boat.

945
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:15,226
Madame.

946
01:15:15,477 --> 01:15:16,347
Hmm?

947
01:15:16,612 --> 01:15:20,182
Oh, perhaps Therese
might like a ginger biscuit.

948
01:15:23,652 --> 01:15:26,312
Every afternoon since the wedding.

949
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:31,992
I'm not much for napping myself.

950
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:47,478
Do you like the chicken?

951
01:15:47,776 --> 01:15:49,826
Yes. Thank you
for bringing me lunch.

952
01:15:50,245 --> 01:15:52,795
Lunchtime used to mean something...

953
01:15:53,282 --> 01:15:55,712
very different for us.

954
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:01,972
We're settling in.

955
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:05,738
I have to get back to work.

956
01:16:07,262 --> 01:16:08,222
Mother.

957
01:16:08,497 --> 01:16:11,927
When I was a girl,
a summer's day...

958
01:16:12,534 --> 01:16:13,764
Oh, there she goes again.

959
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:15,969
Tell us about a summer's day.

960
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:21,730
Oh. I babble on and on and on.

961
01:16:22,711 --> 01:16:24,931
As I drift away.

962
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:29,249
How long will it take?

963
01:16:30,652 --> 01:16:33,642
I think I shall turn...

964
01:16:36,325 --> 01:16:38,225
and see someone I knew.

965
01:16:42,197 --> 01:16:44,127
Someone I loved.

966
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:51,489
A summer's day, spun out like...

967
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:56,750
sugar...

968
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:02,280
spun white.

969
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:05,399
What?

970
01:17:07,322 --> 01:17:09,542
What spun? What? Oh.

971
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:11,452
You--you said a day.

972
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:15,453
We thought the cowpats
were stepping-stones

973
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:19,558
and my sister Amalie
stepped on one

974
01:17:20,769 --> 01:17:23,789
and screamed again,
and I laughed so hard, I thought...

975
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:26,550
Mother.

976
01:17:26,942 --> 01:17:28,312
Oh!

977
01:17:33,448 --> 01:17:34,558
Shh.

978
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:43,363
Madame? Laurent!

979
01:17:44,726 --> 01:17:47,126
- Madame?
- Mother?

980
01:17:48,563 --> 01:17:51,603
Try to get her to move unassisted
as often as possible.

981
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:53,277
The smallest movement will help.

982
01:17:53,568 --> 01:17:54,528
Certainly.

983
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:56,973
And encourage her to talk,
even moan a little.

984
01:17:57,406 --> 01:18:00,016
The slightest sound may help her
regain her speech.

985
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:02,149
So how can she be able to...

986
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:05,351
You know, she's very lucky
to have the two of you

987
01:18:05,881 --> 01:18:08,871
to watch over her.
Good night.

988
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:11,098
Good night, doctor.

989
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:17,010
We're all alone now.

990
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:05,748
Carry her down to the shop
before you leave.

991
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:14,969
All right.

992
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:18,358
Ready, mother?

993
01:19:34,569 --> 01:19:37,059
You need both of our signatures
to get the money.

994
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:39,600
Good morning!

995
01:19:39,841 --> 01:19:41,211
We'll be right down.

996
01:19:48,483 --> 01:19:50,383
Laurent, time to go home.

997
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:52,366
Yeah. Just finishing up.

998
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:15,839
You should learn how to cook.

999
01:20:17,746 --> 01:20:20,146
You should learn how to eat.

1000
01:20:20,782 --> 01:20:24,062
If only I was more like Camille.
Hmm?

1001
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:29,940
Well, it's getting late, isn't it?

1002
01:20:30,892 --> 01:20:32,262
You should be in bed.

1003
01:20:40,135 --> 01:20:42,445
I don't know who you are
sometimes.

1004
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:47,700
Till death do us part, dear.

1005
01:20:54,816 --> 01:20:56,596
Therese!

1006
01:20:56,985 --> 01:20:57,945
What?

1007
01:20:59,888 --> 01:21:01,588
Stop the ticking.

1008
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:05,557
The ticking is the only thing
that drowns you out.

1009
01:21:09,898 --> 01:21:11,008
I'm not saying a word.

1010
01:21:11,299 --> 01:21:13,959
You are. I can hear you.

1011
01:21:14,469 --> 01:21:15,929
What am I saying?

1012
01:21:16,838 --> 01:21:18,148
Exactly what I'm saying.

1013
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:20,467
You're not saying anything.

1014
01:21:21,009 --> 01:21:22,879
The boat.

1015
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:24,358
The afternoon.

1016
01:21:24,646 --> 01:21:25,726
- The sun going down.
- Shh.

1017
01:21:26,014 --> 01:21:27,184
- The fog.
- Come here, come here!

1018
01:21:28,183 --> 01:21:30,323
The shore is gone,
the boat is drifting.

1019
01:21:33,855 --> 01:21:36,635
We're all alone.
He sees my face.

1020
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:38,008
He starts to shout.

1021
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:39,930
I grab his throat.
"Therese!"

1022
01:21:40,295 --> 01:21:42,345
I lift him up and he bites my neck.

1023
01:21:43,365 --> 01:21:44,945
- He screams your name.
- "Therese!"

1024
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,590
- I heave him in!
- "Therese!"

1025
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:53,744
And then he's gone.

1026
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:56,640
That's right, he's gone.

1027
01:21:58,680 --> 01:21:59,760
You killed him?

1028
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:03,863
You liar! You liar!

1029
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:05,012
Liar!

1030
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:06,983
You wanted him dead!

1031
01:22:07,355 --> 01:22:09,935
You begged me to kill him.
We killed him!

1032
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:12,095
Then why does he only haunt you?

1033
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,070
Are you out of your mind?

1034
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:16,599
You know he comes to you
every night.

1035
01:22:17,032 --> 01:22:19,842
He slithers into your dreams
and you wake up screaming.

1036
01:22:20,368 --> 01:22:22,268
I scream because you hold on
too tight

1037
01:22:22,671 --> 01:22:25,221
and your nails bite into my skin!

1038
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:34,221
Oh.

1039
01:22:40,822 --> 01:22:42,662
Oh, God.

1040
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:07,344
Go ahead, say something.

1041
01:23:10,285 --> 01:23:11,395
Spit in my face.

1042
01:23:13,688 --> 01:23:14,738
Tell me to go to hell.

1043
01:23:16,891 --> 01:23:18,731
Where do you think
you are now?

1044
01:23:25,066 --> 01:23:25,936
Therese!

1045
01:23:26,968 --> 01:23:28,838
Therese! Where do you think
you're going? Get over here.

1046
01:23:29,237 --> 01:23:31,047
- Let go of me.
- What are you doing?

1047
01:24:37,305 --> 01:24:38,445
Tea, Madame?

1048
01:24:41,309 --> 01:24:43,769
Six or the two?

1049
01:24:46,681 --> 01:24:48,381
Oh, I see. Voilà.

1050
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:52,620
She sparkles at the six
and won't look at the two, so six.

1051
01:24:54,622 --> 01:24:55,472
Simple.

1052
01:24:55,723 --> 01:24:58,713
My mind over her dead matter.

1053
01:25:00,395 --> 01:25:02,005
Then what is she writing?

1054
01:25:02,363 --> 01:25:03,183
Beg pardon?

1055
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:06,271
While you were going on,
her fingers were tracing letters.

1056
01:25:06,801 --> 01:25:08,141
- Watch.
- Hmm?

1057
01:25:16,478 --> 01:25:17,878
Uh, start over again, Madame.

1058
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:26,860
What's that look like?

1059
01:25:28,189 --> 01:25:28,799
It's a T.

1060
01:25:29,023 --> 01:25:30,163
- It's a T, isn't it?
- Isn't that a T?

1061
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:38,128
H.

1062
01:25:40,368 --> 01:25:41,978
E, the...
The something.

1063
01:25:42,337 --> 01:25:43,097
The...

1064
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:45,678
- Let me see.
- Darling, you're just on my leg.

1065
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:47,431
R-

1066
01:25:50,545 --> 01:25:52,475
- E.
- E.

1067
01:25:52,881 --> 01:25:54,281
There but for the grace...

1068
01:25:54,616 --> 01:25:56,636
- Shut up, Grivet.
- Shh!

1069
01:25:57,051 --> 01:25:58,631
What's the next one?

1070
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:00,477
- S.
- Is that an S?

1071
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:02,112
- It's an S.
- That is an S.

1072
01:26:02,991 --> 01:26:05,041
- E. Therese?
- E. Therese.

1073
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:06,220
Thank you, professor.

1074
01:26:06,461 --> 01:26:07,861
Therese.
She's written "Therese."

1075
01:26:08,196 --> 01:26:10,066
Oh.

1076
01:26:10,465 --> 01:26:12,105
Therese...

1077
01:26:16,104 --> 01:26:17,774
Therese...

1078
01:26:18,139 --> 01:26:19,839
- Therese and...
- Therese and Laurent!

1079
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:21,058
That's what she's written--

1080
01:26:21,309 --> 01:26:22,329
"Therese and Laurent."

1081
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:23,480
Aw.

1082
01:26:24,913 --> 01:26:26,613
Therese and Laurent.

1083
01:26:26,981 --> 01:26:30,701
- A.
- A.

1084
01:26:31,352 --> 01:26:32,932
R-

1085
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:38,735
- E.
- E!

1086
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:40,867
Therese and Laurent are--

1087
01:26:41,262 --> 01:26:42,722
What, Madame?

1088
01:26:56,945 --> 01:26:58,495
- Oh.
- She's tired herself.

1089
01:26:58,846 --> 01:27:01,066
No need for her to finish.

1090
01:27:01,516 --> 01:27:03,476
Just look in her eyes.

1091
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:06,435
Therese and Laurent are...

1092
01:27:06,921 --> 01:27:09,961
wonderful children
who treat me very well.

1093
01:27:11,292 --> 01:27:13,102
Am I right?

1094
01:27:14,462 --> 01:27:15,282
Why is she crying?

1095
01:27:16,397 --> 01:27:17,447
Gratitude.

1096
01:27:17,732 --> 01:27:19,952
No, mother.

1097
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:23,801
We are the ones
that are grateful to you. Shh.

1098
01:27:28,176 --> 01:27:29,256
Ohh.

1099
01:27:32,981 --> 01:27:33,831
- To a perfect couple.
- Yes.

1100
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:35,072
Perfect couple.

1101
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:37,720
This is a happy home.
Good people live here.

1102
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,240
Are those headaches back?

1103
01:27:58,473 --> 01:28:00,083
I can't take it.

1104
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:06,148
The two of you can't fool me
for another moment.

1105
01:28:09,851 --> 01:28:13,071
I predict an addition
to this little family

1106
01:28:13,921 --> 01:28:15,671
- in eight months.
- Oh, no. No, Suzanne,

1107
01:28:16,057 --> 01:28:16,817
- I'm...
- Hmm?

1108
01:28:17,058 --> 01:28:19,138
No, I'm certain.
That's not it.

1109
01:28:41,849 --> 01:28:43,139
Thank you.

1110
01:28:45,787 --> 01:28:47,217
Thank you.

1111
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:55,090
I'm going to go lie down.
My head is throbbing.

1112
01:28:55,930 --> 01:28:57,830
I'll listen for the bell.

1113
01:29:27,328 --> 01:29:28,848
I forgot my buttons.

1114
01:29:48,316 --> 01:29:49,456
I've changed my mind.

1115
01:29:50,184 --> 01:29:51,354
I have to get out of here.

1116
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:02,390
Go ahead. Hmm?

1117
01:30:04,031 --> 01:30:06,221
Bore a hole right through me.

1118
01:30:06,667 --> 01:30:08,277
Right here.

1119
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:12,591
Who sold me into marriage,
hmm?

1120
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:18,449
Who would do anything
to keep from being alone?

1121
01:30:21,048 --> 01:30:22,448
You.

1122
01:31:10,998 --> 01:31:13,108
Drink up. It's time to go.

1123
01:31:13,534 --> 01:31:15,144
The bar closed half an hour ago.

1124
01:31:16,504 --> 01:31:18,584
- Sorry, darling.
- No, don't leave.

1125
01:31:19,006 --> 01:31:20,266
Well, we can't stay here.

1126
01:31:20,575 --> 01:31:22,275
Don't..don't leave.
Don't leave. Please stay.

1127
01:31:22,643 --> 01:31:23,873
Sorry, darling.

1128
01:31:33,855 --> 01:31:35,165
No, please stay.

1129
01:31:36,424 --> 01:31:38,234
You must stay.

1130
01:31:40,595 --> 01:31:42,435
Could I buy you a drink?

1131
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:48,825
I have one.

1132
01:31:50,137 --> 01:31:51,247
Can I buy you?

1133
01:31:54,008 --> 01:31:55,118
I'm free.

1134
01:31:58,513 --> 01:31:59,333
Hmm.

1135
01:32:00,781 --> 01:32:02,011
Get up on this table.

1136
01:32:02,316 --> 01:32:03,986
Come on. Lift your skirt.

1137
01:32:07,588 --> 01:32:08,378
For what?

1138
01:32:11,893 --> 01:32:14,883
Come on. You'll see.

1139
01:32:15,429 --> 01:32:17,299
This will make it all better.

1140
01:32:23,804 --> 01:32:24,674
Hang on.

1141
01:32:24,939 --> 01:32:26,459
Go on. Yeah.

1142
01:32:26,807 --> 01:32:28,557
One second. Hold on.

1143
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:34,300
I don't want you.

1144
01:33:05,479 --> 01:33:08,199
Prussic acid.
Quick as lightning.

1145
01:33:08,816 --> 01:33:11,156
Tiniest drop you'll never
see those rats again.

1146
01:33:14,589 --> 01:33:15,729
Have a good morning.

1147
01:33:22,229 --> 01:33:23,689
Laurent?

1148
01:33:26,867 --> 01:33:29,007
Laurent, come and get her.

1149
01:34:18,052 --> 01:34:19,102
Hello?

1150
01:34:25,893 --> 01:34:27,093
Hello?

1151
01:34:31,432 --> 01:34:32,452
Madame?

1152
01:34:34,402 --> 01:34:35,222
Hello?

1153
01:34:41,542 --> 01:34:42,652
Oh.

1154
01:34:50,918 --> 01:34:52,618
We'll be right down, Suzanne.

1155
01:34:55,823 --> 01:34:57,253
- Oh, no!
- Careful!

1156
01:34:59,193 --> 01:35:00,503
Suzanne?

1157
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:22,600
I loved your son.

1158
01:35:23,150 --> 01:35:24,110
Please.

1159
01:35:25,386 --> 01:35:27,026
And if you could forgive me,

1160
01:35:27,388 --> 01:35:29,758
I'd kill myself and end in peace.

1161
01:35:30,224 --> 01:35:32,804
Please, do you forgive me?

1162
01:35:35,529 --> 01:35:36,459
Do you forgive...

1163
01:35:37,431 --> 01:35:38,861
Do you forgive me?

1164
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:40,220
Get off the floor.

1165
01:35:40,501 --> 01:35:42,281
- Forgive me, please.
- Oh, get off the floor!

1166
01:35:42,670 --> 01:35:44,280
- Please.
- Yes, she forgives you!

1167
01:35:44,638 --> 01:35:45,688
Look! She forgives you!

1168
01:35:45,973 --> 01:35:48,553
She wishes that she had
a dozen children

1169
01:35:49,043 --> 01:35:50,773
so you could kill them all
as well!

1170
01:35:52,780 --> 01:35:54,590
- They've come for us, Therese.
- I'm sorry.

1171
01:35:54,982 --> 01:35:56,242
Go see who it is.

1172
01:35:57,384 --> 01:35:58,554
I want this over.

1173
01:35:58,853 --> 01:36:00,873
Therese, go see who it is.

1174
01:36:01,288 --> 01:36:04,128
Go! Go!

1175
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:23,069
May I help you, sir'?

1176
01:36:25,846 --> 01:36:26,746
Olivier.

1177
01:36:27,014 --> 01:36:28,884
Ah, I, uh I didn't hear
you come down.

1178
01:36:29,283 --> 01:36:30,923
Is Suzanne with you?

1179
01:36:31,285 --> 01:36:33,945
No. No, I was just passing by.

1180
01:36:34,455 --> 01:36:35,795
We haven't seen any of you
in so long.

1181
01:36:36,123 --> 01:36:37,963
I know.
Madame has been very ill.

1182
01:36:38,359 --> 01:36:39,499
May I say hello to her?

1183
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:42,254
She's sound asleep.
I'll tell her you stopped in.

1184
01:36:42,730 --> 01:36:44,250
Yes, let her know
that we send our best.

1185
01:36:44,598 --> 01:36:45,558
<i>Mmm.</i>

1186
01:36:47,568 --> 01:36:50,468
Well, hopefully we'll start
our Thursday evenings very soon.

1187
01:36:51,005 --> 01:36:52,675
She misses them so much.

1188
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,000
As do we.

1189
01:36:55,142 --> 01:36:56,342
Olivier.

1190
01:37:00,314 --> 01:37:01,804
Your hat.

1191
01:37:04,718 --> 01:37:05,768
Oh.

1192
01:37:10,958 --> 01:37:12,388
Have a good morning.

1193
01:37:44,458 --> 01:37:46,098
It's all gone.
The shop is completely empty.

1194
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:47,130
It's been abandoned.

1195
01:37:49,029 --> 01:37:50,759
- This way?
- The river.

1196
01:37:51,131 --> 01:37:52,001
They're headed this way?

1197
01:38:11,151 --> 01:38:12,641
Did you ever love me?

1198
01:38:13,387 --> 01:38:14,257
Yes.

1199
01:38:16,824 --> 01:38:18,434
When he was alive.

1200
01:38:20,461 --> 01:38:21,481
I loved you.

1201
01:38:24,465 --> 01:38:25,135
After I killed him.

1202
01:38:25,366 --> 01:38:26,626
We killed him.

1203
01:38:35,643 --> 01:38:37,513
Do you want some wine?

1204
01:38:37,912 --> 01:38:39,582
Yes.

1205
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:21,567
I want to kiss you.

1206
01:39:23,624 --> 01:39:25,764
From your neck to your thigh.

1207
01:39:28,295 --> 01:39:30,255
- Put my tongue inside--
- We did all that.

1208
01:39:51,852 --> 01:39:53,312
Do it.

1209
01:39:55,622 --> 01:39:58,812
No. You.

1210
01:41:17,371 --> 01:41:19,041
This way, this way.

1211
01:41:19,406 --> 01:41:20,226
Down there.

1212
01:41:25,879 --> 01:41:26,749
Therese!
