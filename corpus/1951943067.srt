1
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,336
You can't take the Chyron chip
rom me!

2
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,850
It's my idea, my design,
my patent.

3
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,934
Trace you have to defend your
patent for the Chyron chip...

4
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,134
The investors have financed the
development of the chip

5
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,935
By law, if they can't be repaid,
the patent belongs to them.

6
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,329
You can't give it to them!

7
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,492
They will pollute the vision of
everything my chip stands for

8
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,374
Here is an opening!

9
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,250
It has fire marks on it!
Break it in!

10
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,898
This way.

11
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,091
We got a live one over here

12
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,135
- Get the gurney out.
Pull gurney out.

13
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,773
We have to repair that shattered
maxillary fracture.

14
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,972
We're gonna lose him. We're
gonna fix that damn artery

15
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,140
We're losing the vital signs,
get me RD forty.

16
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,178
Heart stopped.
He need to defibrillate.

17
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:17,613
- Clear!
- One, two, three!

18
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,455
Patient is a male.
Late twenties...

19
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,534
multiple amputee, smoke lesions
on the lungs...

20
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,136
and third degree burns over
eighteen per cent of his body.

21
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,574
Transferred from County?

22
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,693
They amputated both of his legs
and reconstructed his face.

23
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,528
- Well, what's the veredict?
- It's hard to tell...

24
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,930
so many different pathways
through the interface

25
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,136
only one way to find out.

26
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,259
Hello, can you hear me?

27
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,334
Peter Peter pumpkin eater?

28
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,499
- What does it mean?
- It means he can hear us.

29
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,938
What is your name?

30
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,370
- Peter Peter pumpkin eater.
Maybe his name is Peter.

31
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,893
I'll try this. "Had a wife, but
couldn't keep her".

32
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,289
Jobe... Hello, Jobe.

33
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:50,129
Jobe, tell me about yourself.

34
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,336
Empty space. It is all just
empty space inside...

35
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,735
like it is been erased.

36
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,136
Try to visualize all the people
and places that you have met.

37
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,934
Just relax and let the images
come to you.

38
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,336
- Jobe! Hey, Jobe!
- Hi, Peter.

39
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,134
- Look what I've got.
Is that the new Cosmic Man?

40
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,935
- Yeah, it is great!
- Thanks, buddy.

41
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,410
Happy birthday, Jobe. Make a wish

42
00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:01,894
Excuse me... Jobe. I am Jonathon
Walker. I run this place...

43
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:07,329
I own the patent to the Chyron
chip and you can build it.

44
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,849
Jobe, there is nothing
to be afraid of...

45
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,535
Virtual Reality will rehabilitate
your mind your body...

46
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,692
You'll be alright, I promise...

47
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,571
just concentrate. Okay?
We'll try some music.

48
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,738
Access granted.

49
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,618
LOS ANGELES. The future.

50
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,500
Hey, Matt... Matt!

51
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,419
- Come here. Have you seen Peter?
No, sorry...

52
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,937
Get down on your knees, repent!
Man destroys man.

53
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:07,812
Before the end. Get down and pray
for forgiveness before...

54
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,408
Thank you. Your videophone access
code is approved.

55
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,289
Yeah! That was awesome!

56
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:42,456
Here, let me see... Cool! Here.

57
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,129
- Crap!
Man are you okey?

58
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,049
Are you crazy, Peter?
You know it can't hurt me.

59
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,178
- How long, Travis?
- Right now. Did you get it?

60
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,378
Just shoulder sifted it
on the way over.

61
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,571
You are a saint. Thank you.
Come on, let's go inside...

62
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,411
I've got his password
you got the access code...

63
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,814
Man, we are set.

64
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,373
What's up, Travis?

65
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,133
How about a taste of remote
presence, my friends?

66
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,450
All hooked up and ready to go.

67
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,009
All right.
Et's use the Cybercycle disc.

68
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,696
- No way, I am flying.
- Me too.

69
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,854
I am waitin' for this all day.

70
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,816
Please enter videophone
access code...

71
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,937
trapdoor access
to Cyberscape granted...

72
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,138
ten, nine, eight, seven...

73
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,214
six, five, four, three...

74
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,092
two, one...

75
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,536
Trapdoor opened. Enter now.

76
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,294
- Peter, what's happening?
- What's going on?

77
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,656
Who is doing this?

78
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,412
Shawn, the Cybercycles.

79
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,690
Harvey, put in the
Cybercycle disc...

80
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,533
Harvey, can you hear me? Put in
the Cybercycle disc now!

81
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,568
No one jacks-out until we find
who is doing this!

82
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,138
You are alive! How can that be?

83
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,689
There isn't time, Peter.
Need your help. I am diyng.

84
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,448
What do you mean dying?

85
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,413
The Cyberspace is dying and
so am I right along with it...

86
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,858
I am trapped here, Peter.
You have to help me.

87
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,410
- I do not get it.
- I need you to find Trace.

88
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,220
- What?
Doctor Benjamin Trace.

89
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,851
When the Cyberspace dies,
so do I.

90
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,491
What if he won't jack-in?

91
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,369
I'm building his chip Chyron,
I need the Egypt link.

92
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,259
- Peter?
- Peter!

93
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,019
I do not think he's breathing.

94
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,093
- What do we do?
- Let's try CPR.

95
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,337
- Hurry up, we have no time.
Alright.

96
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:50,008
One, two, three, four, five...
Breath! Breath, Peter!

97
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,053
One, two, three, four, five.
Breath!

98
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,574
It is not working.

99
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,376
One, two, three, four...
Come on, get up. Are you OK?

100
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,172
If you knew you were in danger,
you should have jacket-out!

101
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,655
It was the most exciting tele-
presence I've ever lived.

102
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,175
I want to talk to Halloway person
to person, okay?

103
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,696
I don't want any other nonsense.
We are running out of time.

104
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,892
Well, Senator Greenspan. How
wonderful to see you again...

105
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,729
Welcome to the
Virtual Light Institute.

106
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,135
My head of research and
development, Doc. Cori Platt...

107
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,139
and this is Jennifer.
Please come with me, Senator.

108
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,532
Senators, Virtual Light...

109
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:16,139
until now, no one has had
he ability to create...

110
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:20,936
an entire computer network based
ithin Virtual Reality...

111
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,696
I'll render all other
systems obsolete.

112
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,216
Virtual Reality has evolved from
a simulation to an actual place.

113
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,735
Watch your head, those
monitors'll kill you...

114
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,175
So, it is like a whole
new world out there.

115
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,416
Full of interesting possibilities
I understand.

116
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,134
I love a man that does his
homework. Do not you, Doctor?

117
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,689
Well, Senator, what is holding us
back is final...

118
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,697
congressional approval
of our license.

119
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,615
This must be the Chyron chip
that everybody is talking about.

120
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,380
The key to my
Virtual Light Uplink.

121
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,576
Since the information
superhighway...

122
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,692
has left people feeling isolated
from their fellow man...

123
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,411
the Virtual Light Institute will
bring cultures together...

124
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,935
in one continuous
Virtual Enviroment.

125
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,651
And this is our main
control room...

126
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,619
hub of all our operations here at
Virtual Light.

127
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,490
I am still a little unclear as to
ow this fits together.

128
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,819
Well, I am sure Doctor Platt will
enlighten you. Jennifer, please.

129
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,135
The outer circle represents
the real world...

130
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,098
the inner one, Virtual Reality...

131
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,735
the spokes are the different
pathways between the two...

132
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,336
the Chyron chip will open up
these pathways simultaneously...

133
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:45,095
so a network based inside VR
can be accessed by everyone.

134
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,456
So, next miracle...

135
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,015
When you hook into the library of
my Virtual city...

136
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,450
you hook into every library in
the world...

137
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,891
the chip will bring everything
on line for everyone.

138
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,376
Well, yes, it is very pretty,
onathon, but I think...

139
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,130
we'd be placing quite a
concentration of power in your lap

140
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,854
My lap is your lap, Senator.

141
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,089
- Twinkie?
How did it go?

142
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,538
Walker makes me feel like the
star poodle on his dog show.

143
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,455
- At least you get top billing.
- Walker always gets top billing.

144
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,454
The Chyron chip and designing
the Virtual City.

145
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,615
I do not mind.

146
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:48,489
I care about how other people see
you, how they perceive you.

147
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,774
That's your world, Dr. Platt, not
mine. My world is in here...

148
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,499
out there people look at me and
they see half a person...

149
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,814
but in here, they see what
I want them to see...

150
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:13,612
- how I really am.
- I don't see half a person.

151
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,696
- That's your world.
- Good night, Jobe

152
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,613
What do you want?

153
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,572
You sure don't look like the
ather of Virtual Reality to me.

154
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,295
- What?
- You are Dr. Benjamin Trace, right?

155
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,736
- He's dead.
- Dead?

156
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,896
That's not what they said in the
Internet. They said he was here.

157
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,492
The Benjamin Trace you want
is resting in peace.

158
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,056
I suggest you get on that cool
bike of yours and go on home.

159
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,489
Don't know what Jobe was thinking
he's just as crazy as this guy.

160
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,339
Trippy fool invented some kind of
Chyron chip.

161
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,816
- What did you say?
Chyron chip?

162
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,772
Come inside.

163
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:13,369
- So, what's your name, kid?
- Peter... Doc.

164
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:22,896
Call me Trace. Well, Peter, it's
all in here. All the answers

165
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:33,133
- in the water, in the air...
- The reason I came is because.

166
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,173
My friend Jobe is dying. You're
he only one who could save him.

167
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,732
You seem a bit young to know
anything about the Chyron chip.

168
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,414
- Well, Jobe told me about it.
- Who is Jobe?

169
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,538
He was our lawnmower man back
when my mom was still alive...

170
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,578
he was my best friend, but now
he's stuck in Virtual Reality.

171
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,771
- What does he know about it?
- He is building it.

172
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:00,210
- He is building it?
- That's what he said. I need you

173
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:06,689
I don't live that life anymore.
That technology just consumes you

174
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:14,411
I need your help. You can
find me at the 3rd st. Station.

175
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,220
Tunnel eleven,
if you change your mind.

176
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,339
Doctor Benjamin Trace.
Only he can stop this.

177
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,533
- What if he won't jack-in?
Tell him I'm building his chip.

178
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,974
- My dog does not stink.
- Yes, it does, Shawn...

179
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,609
- the funck is burning my eyes.
- It does not stink!

180
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,449
I looked at him and I almost
went blind. Harvey used...

181
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,133
to be a poodle. He looks like
a Chihuahua on steroids.

182
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,329
Who is it?

183
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,293
You know this guy, Peter?

184
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,333
Back off. This is the guy Jobe
old me about!

185
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,330
- You all live down here?
- This is just our summer cottage.

186
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:39,453
- I love your ventilation system.
Listen, this guy can help us.

187
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,453
Adults have betrayed me my whole
life. You know that, Peter.

188
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,897
Look, Travis, you don't have to
trust him. You must trust Peter.

189
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,851
So, you are the Einstein of VR?

190
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,970
I'll take that
as a compliment, Travis...

191
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,540
You know, Einstein made a few
mistakes himself.

192
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,579
- What are these?
- Man, you must be a dinosaur!

193
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:13,373
The electroplates on the sides?
They hit your temple and tap into

194
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,458
certain neurons, giving you full
neuro-sensory involvement.

195
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,533
- You can actually feel?
- Exactly...

196
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,135
See, that's why we have to save
Jobe, though. Because he's real

197
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,729
in there. He dies in there,
he is going to die out there.

198
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,692
Are you sure Jobe need saving?

199
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:31,977
What are you trying to say? Jobe
wouldn't lie to me.

200
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,132
You said you couldn't trust
any adults

201
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:39,978
He's not like you. I mean, he's
like a kid. He was until...

202
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,610
- Until what?
- Until my next door nieghbor did

203
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,414
some experiments with him in VR
and turned him from a simpleton

204
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,693
into a genius. We are wasting
time. You can ask him yourself.

205
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,413
- Ready!
Let's hook it up. Let's do it.

206
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,812
- Doc, here is your stuff.
No, I do not want to go into VR

207
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:09,133
- Why not?
I'm not ready yet. It is scary.

208
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:15,017
- I might get lost or something.
- Fine, I'll go in.

209
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:24,370
Back door access to Cyberspace
granted, please stand by.

210
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,692
Welcome to my world, Peter.
Did you bring the good Doctor?

211
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:51,974
- No, he's watching.
- Jack-in, jack-off.

212
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:55,976
Scared of the boogy man, doctor?
You can at least humor me with

213
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,289
a point of view, can not you?

214
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,572
It is a pleasure to finally meet
you. I feel like we're almost

215
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,418
I am blushing... family.

216
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,414
- I do not think so, Jobe.
- Don't be sure."Incest", the game...

217
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:17,051
the whole family can play.
My brother is my Daddy.

218
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,411
Doc, we are both unwanted,
under appreciated and...

219
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,532
ahead of our time. And the only
difference is your time was then.

220
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,973
- My time is now.
- It's a short ride. Enjoy it.

221
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:32,772
I plan to enjoy it for a long
time. I've found the secret to...

222
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,131
- inmortality in the Chyron chip.
- Where is the Chyron chip?

223
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,932
Come with me, won't you?

224
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:03,057
There she is... Miss Chyron chip!

225
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:08,139
It is taken years of work, but
our Chyron chip is a reality.

226
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,334
Look what I am doing, Doctor.
Sn't it amazing?

227
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,135
You do not look like you are in
danger. What do you want?

228
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:24,257
Egypt. Do not hold back on
me. It is a hidden "nano-routine"

229
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,735
encoded into the design of
he Chyron chip.

230
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:31,259
- I'm not going to help you.
- You share Egypt with me and I'II...

231
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:34,657
share with you technological
knowledge beyond your dreams.

232
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:38,256
This is your worl too, Doctor.
Your work helped create it.

233
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:43,250
My work is to build it. Now,
tell me. What does Egypt mean?

234
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:47,533
I'm not going to tell you.
You don't understand its power

235
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:51,729
I do, Doctor. And in 3 days I'll
be in every system in the world

236
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:58,094
Tell me what Egypt means, doctor,
before I get really pissed off!

237
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,739
Get out of here, Peter!

238
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,853
It is getting out of control!

239
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,455
Something is wrong. I've
neverseen Jobe like that before.

240
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,693
Stop it! I can stop it!

241
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,539
I thought you said the trains
didn't run through these tunnels.

242
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,099
They do not!

243
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,210
Oh, my God, It is heading
right for us!

244
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,575
Get out of here!

245
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,179
But this is our home!

246
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,658
Dispatch, do something!

247
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,535
Implement emergency procedures
immediately.

248
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,049
Dispatch shut all systems down.
Disengage...

249
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:41,332
Come on! Jade, Peter, hurry up!

250
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,932
The game is afoot.

251
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,612
Closed track. Code red.

252
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:14,216
The caboose is loose.

253
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,656
Shawn, let's go, come on!

254
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,816
I can not leave Harvey here!

255
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,848
Come on, Trace, get out of there!

256
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,175
Let's get out of here, it is
going to blow!

257
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,940
Now, let's deal with the
true believers.

258
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,217
Show me all the contributors to
fundamental world religions over.

259
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,569
The past five years.

260
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,619
And each user thinks that
they have total privacy.

261
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,892
Every time anyone logs onto
Virtual Light Uplink...

262
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,370
we'll know everything about them.

263
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:01,970
Show me all hypocriticaldemocrats
making over 300,000 a year.

264
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,819
That train was no accident,
was it?

265
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,976
Not a chance.

266
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,978
Man, now we have lost our home
and the Cyberspace.

267
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,097
I bet Jobe did it, so he could
build this his city.

268
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,092
Like this world didn't suck
enough already.

269
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,053
I think that's just a taste of
what he could do if.

270
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,938
It can not get any worse.

271
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:29,496
W What's with this Egyptthing,
Doesn't he need it from you?

272
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,777
If Jobe's worried about Egypt,
it means he's about to use it

273
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,811
to its full hideous potential.

274
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,974
Which is?

275
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:40,809
Enter every system in the world
and take over through VR.

276
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,659
So is there any way
to stop him or...

277
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,498
should we just start digging
ourown graves?

278
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,851
We've got to stael him the Chyron
chip before he figures out Egypt.

279
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,972
Federal Library?

280
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,855
If we could use their computers
we'll find the chip.

281
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,574
That's right, Peter, let's go.

282
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,936
Initiate image regeneration.

283
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,295
You have to help me.

284
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,819
Isn't that just like a recording?

285
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:18,251
We have to strip away the layers
within the program to discover

286
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:21,532
who the software that Jobe used
to enter VR was licensed to.

287
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,609
We have a problem.

288
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,812
I can not get past the memory
lock to isolate the chain.

289
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,450
Simple. Just enhance
the memoryindex.

290
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,775
What have we got hare?

291
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,258
Actualize data.

292
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,052
Five...

293
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,814
Here we go...

294
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,978
Execute worm function.

295
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,132
Enhance.

296
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,657
Redimensionalize variables.

297
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,815
All we have to do now is access
Datatronic Systems.

298
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,738
I am right with you, Doc...

299
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,134
there is our registered
wner. Platt.

300
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,856
I am accessing phone
listings, now.

301
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,736
We have forty three Platts.

302
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,740
See if you have a Cori Platt.

303
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:37,209
No Cori, but we have 3 C.
Platts. One is a PhD.

304
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,820
Trace, pull over.

305
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,299
Aren't we going to Dr.
Platt's apartment?

306
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,731
First we have to get tracker so
she can lead us to the chip.

307
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,012
It is locked.

308
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:15,849
- How are they going to do this?
- No problem. My brother can...

309
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,418
handle it. He is great at this
kind of stuff.

310
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,651
It is unlocked. Let's go shopping.

311
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:35,653
Well, the extra day I got
Greenspan to stay was useless...

312
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:39,375
that liberal idiot is on his way
back to Washington right now...

313
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,970
to recommend that they rescind
our license to go on line.

314
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:48,613
If we lose that license,
we aredead.

315
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,138
Accesing LAX Reservations file.

316
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:13,931

318
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,018
Access denied.

319
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,089
Access granted.

320
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:35,811
Reset system. Auto pilot descent
from thirty thousand feet.

321
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,250
Warming. Altitude 15,000 feet.

322
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,928
Execute.

323
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,736
We have lost the instrument panel
Activate auto pilot.

324
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:49,649
Auto pilot activated.
Descent rate increasing.

325
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,054
Override auto pilot.

326
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,455
I can not!

327
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,934
Contact approach. Declare an
emergency.

328
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,729
Oh, my God!

329
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,409
Open top secret files.

330
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:23,694
Request data transcripts.
Jobe, Virtual Light.

331
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,418
You are awfully nosey,
aren't you, Guillermo?

332
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:03,611
Hi, you haven't forgotten me?

333
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,295
No for lack of trying.

334
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,534
How have you been?

335
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,139
Fine, Ben. What do you want?

336
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:14,770
I need to talk to you. About Jobe

337
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,530
- He's not what you think he is.
Neither were you.

338
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,289
He's very dangerous, Cori.

339
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,458
Hardly. And what makes you think
you can just show up here...

340
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,139
and entertain a conversation
with me?

341
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:27,776
- You have right to be angry
- I am not angry. I am leaving!

342
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,652
Let's go.

343
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:37,375
You look terrific. More beautiful
than I remember.

344
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,500
Has Jobe used up all the memory
in your system?

345
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,373
Every printed word, thought and
deed in human history...

346
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,491
couldn't begin to fill up the
type of memory we are using.

347
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,928
Because of my Chyron chip.

348
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,529
I heard you deserted that
project just like you did us.

349
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,891
I am sorry you lost
the patent.

350
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,215
I do not want pity, Cori.
I want the chip.

351
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,331
And you want me to help you
get it. Forget it.

352
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,899
You should know what Jobe
is up to.

353
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,739
Do not patronize me, Trace.
I'm not your student anymore.

354
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,254
He tried to kill me, Cori...

355
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,337
you musn't not let go him go
on line. Check his data file...

356
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,053
you'll be surprised of what
you find there.

357
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,770
- How are we doing?
- Cool. The tracker is working.

358
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,888
That's where we have to break
into to get the chip?

359
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,010
Do you have any ideas?

360
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:03,776
We could have Jade tap into the
County engineering and pull up...

361
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,049
the blue prints on that place.

362
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:07,052
That's good idea.

363
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,898
You are cleverer than you look.

364
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,134
- Where is David?
- I don't know. He was just here.

365
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,617
Take that down to the mail room.

366
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,336
Arthur, it looks like you have
been going at it for hours.

367
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:27,535
Walker's orders.

368
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:36,057
You don't do anything on this
project withuot my authorization.

369
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,970
Can I speak with you for a moment?

370
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:47,289
I do take my responsabilities
just as seriously as you do.

371
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,536
You do your job, a
nd let me do mine.

372
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,298
What exactly is your job?

373
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,375
We've got a problem.

374
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:01,613
All available memory capacity on
the I ten eighty six S is gone.

375
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,699
That's imposible.

376
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,412
I know that.

377
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:22,128
What's is going on? I didn't
authorize this equipment.

378
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,729
- What happened to the memory?
- I forgot.

379
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:28,052
- Walker's behind schedule.
- We are not behind the schedule.

380
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,613
He is losing memory and he wants
Jobe working around the clock on

381
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:30,775
the Virtual Light

382
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:32,095
I'm not going to discuss this
with you.

383
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,494
He's going on line tomorrow.

384
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:39,818
Mr. Walker... Mr. Walker...

385
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:44,854
I think you have made a mistake,
Doctor.

386
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,290
No. I think you have made
a mistake.

387
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:50,219
Why wasn't I notified that you
intend to put Jobe on line?

388
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:54,538
We'II, you are just a scientist.
I am a businessman.

389
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,498
And Jobe is a human being.

390
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,818
And every day that VR
goes unfinished is costing me

391
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:06,658
millions in potential revenue.

392
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:09,619
He's showing signs of
instabilities. I am worried.

393
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:16,694
Well, the man is at a distinct
disadvantage.

394
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:23,136
You've been profiting off this
man's misery for years...

395
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,690
how many times have you postponed
his prosthetics legs?

396
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:30,655
I couldn't have him getting up
and walking out on us now...

397
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:35,570
could I? Why do not we discuss
this after Jobe goes on line?

398
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,573
Requets file, Jobe.

399
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:57,972
Access denied. Code 7.

400
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:00,740
Override code seven,
three-nine-four-two.

401
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:08,337
Access granted. Please wait.

402
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:12,533
File 248, Jobe empty.
Contest erased.

403
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:14,649
Whose authorization?

404
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,649
Jonathon Walker.

405
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,773
Cooper, you finish the security
and go tosection twenty-four.

406
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:06,131
- Dr. Platt!
Henry! You startled me.

407
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:09,418
Just making my rounds.
Is everything okay?

408
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:13,251
I was just dropping off some
production charts for the week.

409
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:15,937
- Good night, Henry.
Good night.

410
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:47,130
- Are you all right?
Yes, we'll be just fine.

411
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:48,773
Wait! Let me...

412
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:05,528
Me again. I was right, wasn't I?
Jobe is expanding his memory base

413
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:06,695
Get out of the car.

414
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:12,258
Good, I caught you.

415
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:17,139
A guard reported seeing you in my
office this evening.

416
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:21,215
You could have come up with a
better excuse

417
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,968
Jobe is going on line tomorrow,
so I wanted to deliver...

418
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:28,810
- them to you myself.
- I see. Well. Good.

419
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:34,137
Be sure you get some rest.
We have a big day tomorrow.

420
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:44,137
You are working for Jonathon
Walker? He stole my patent.

421
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,574
He didn't exactly steal it.

422
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,970
He was one of the investors that
took me to court.

423
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,653
Get out of the car!

424
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:53,653
I was right about the memory base
I am right about Jobe.

425
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:55,532
I don't think you or Walker
understand the power...

426
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:57,775
Get out.

427
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,660
I thought you were better than
this, Cori.

428
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,333
You stole a gun?

429
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:21,418
No, man. It is a camera,
check it out.

430
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,129
Cool.

431
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,490
Alright. Let's do it.

432
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:46,373
Execute virtual surveillance
system loop.

433
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:50,056
Your attention, please.
A coolant test will be run...

434
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:55,698
on levels eight through ten at OH
three hundred hours. Thank you.

435
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:33,454
Lieutenant Martin to Security...

436
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:54,096
Sub level four.

437
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:21,537
You have to understand, with those
tubes you have to be heli-arch...

438
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:25,653
about three inches wide. Guess
you do not realize is that...

439
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:29,978
an alumnium tubing about
eight millimeters thick.

440
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:55,651
That is a special laser alarm.
Sensitive to anything above 0°C.

441
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:00,856
Come. I have an idea.

442
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:21,530
It's Doctor Platt. I seemto have
left my key card in the lab.

443
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,935
Yes, Doctor. I'm sorry, we didn't
know it was you.

444
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:25,135
Thank you.

445
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:56,130
You ready?

446
00:52:56,580 --> 00:53:00,493
I don't think so. This isn't one
of your best ideas.

447
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,770
I wouldn't trust anybody else.
You can do it.

448
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:24,609
Grab it! Grab it!

449
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:36,859
What are you doing?

450
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:39,170
He will kill them!

451
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,615
What is going on?

452
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:53,533
- By the way, who are you?
- Security.

453
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:17,010
Sealing sector four.

454
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,970
Sector four secured.

455
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:26,657
You want the chip?
Put your guns down...

456
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:29,415
Put them down or I will smash it.

457
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:38,812
Put them down now!
Slide them forward.

458
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:55,615
You have the card?

459
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,131
What now? Here!

460
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,570
- Where?
- Go on. Go.

461
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,178
Why did I let you back
into my life?

462
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:37,336
You find me irresistible.

463
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,093
You got the chip?

464
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:42,576
Good work.

465
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,254
You are bleeding.

466
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:48,732
Let us get out of there.

467
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,739
- What is that?
- Just some dirt.

468
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:15,015
Bring it to me!

469
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,372
Get that dirt, you idiots!

470
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:27,091
Take off your shirt.

471
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:29,848
What do you have in mind?

472
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:35,609
I need to stop this bleeding and
I'm not going to use my shirt.

473
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,328
Do I know you, guys?

474
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:46,055
- I owe you an apology, Cori.
- You could say that.

475
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:50,219
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.

476
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:54,650
Okay, so apologize.

477
00:58:55,940 --> 00:59:00,934
I am sorry, Cori. I really am.

478
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:06,976
I did not want to see anybody.
I was too ambitious, I was naive

479
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:08,215
Stupid.

480
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,138
That too.

481
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:15,810
Thanks for the medical attention.

482
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:18,176
You are welcome for the medical
attention.

483
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:23,738
Race you to the top of the hill.

484
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:33,453
Pretty neat, huh?

485
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:36,172
It's incredible...

486
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:39,897
They were able to bypass the
capability protection registers?

487
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:44,498
It makes me wonder if I could
have ever finished it myself.

488
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:49,415
The chip was supposed to make
things better for them.

489
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:52,771
Ironic. Still maybe it could.

490
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:55,337
What did he do here?

491
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,649
That's where Jobe merged the
nano-matching hardware.

492
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:03,693
He couldn't have. There is no
trans-matrix.

493
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:06,169
There isn't.

494
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:12,498
Something's wrong.
It should be there.

495
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:14,573
So you lost the chip.

496
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:17,779
You idiot.

497
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:21,653
Do you honestly think I'd entrust
something that important to you?

498
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:24,769
Voila!

499
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:28,537
People want a show...

500
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:33,014
and now that Jobe has solved the
link, the chip can be activated.

501
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,332
Now, get out of my sight.

502
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:41,259
Any progress?

503
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:45,335
Jobe is tracking down the intruders

504
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:48,131
And you are a genious.

505
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:53,051
Yes, I know. I think it is time
we call the President.

506
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:55,139
Try to get Virtual Light Europe.

507
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:56,773
- Where?
- Anywhere.

508
01:00:57,580 --> 01:01:00,458
Uplink, England, Virtual Light...

509
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:09,533
Nothing.

510
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:15,132
Greetings, Mr. President.

511
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:18,491
And thank you for joining us
in this momentous occasion.

512
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:19,655
I am happy to be here.

513
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:23,933
I was shocked to hear about
Greenspan's dreadful accident...

514
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:27,417
I know how much he wanted to be
a part of what we are doing here.

515
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:29,493
But, "la vie continue"...

516
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:33,169
We will be joined by hundreds of
others prominent people...

517
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:35,530
who'll be jacking-in from all
over the country...

518
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:38,694
so, if you are ready, don your
eyephones...

519
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:40,930
and we can begin.

520
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:52,979
- I am...
- Just relax.

521
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:29,010
Ladies and gentlemen...

522
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:33,014
Welcome to Virtual Light...

523
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:37,131
We stand in the face of a new age...

524
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:40,210
The future is one world...

525
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:43,856
one thought, one mind...

526
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:46,459
Behold.

527
01:02:56,060 --> 01:03:00,292
The future is now!

528
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:20,336
Twelve hours to Global interface.

529
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:08,408
It is all taken care of.

530
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:11,134
The foreign marketplace will be
secure only when they place...

531
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:12,819
their money in your hands.

532
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:14,612
Excellent work, Jobe.

533
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:22,411
- It is already started to happen
What's that supposed to mean?

534
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:26,219
It means that Jobe must have
figured a way around Egypt.

535
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:28,299
And he's using the chip
to enter...

536
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:32,379
every system around the world,
replacing it with himself

537
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:35,570
It takes about twelve hours for
the interface to complete.

538
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:38,499
Once complete it is irreversible.

539
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:39,769
Walker is going to stop him.

540
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:42,930
Are you crazy? Who do you think
is doing this with him?

541
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:46,173
Walker is a businessman and Jobe
is bad for business.

542
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:50,499
Come on!

543
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:56,095
What a surprise. I did not expect
to hear from you so soon, Doctor.

544
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:58,570
You have to stop Jobe before
it's too late.

545
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:02,610
Too late? What happened to your
sense of loyalty, Cori?

546
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:04,134
You wouldn't know the meaning of
the word, Walker.

547
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:08,376
Is that Doctor Benjamin Trace?

548
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:11,811
Listen, Walker, you have to take
Jobe off line immediately.

549
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:16,057
I would love to accommodate you,
Doctor, I really would.

550
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:18,977
But that is not an opinion
I can exercise right now.

551
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:20,659
Listen to me, you stupid bastard!

552
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:23,738
If you do not take him off line
you will have no options.

553
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:25,618
Are you threatening me, Doctor?

554
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:28,698
No, I'm not. Jobe is.

555
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:33,377
Jobe is a loyal employee.
I 'd trust him with my life.

556
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:36,492
You better, because you just
gave it to him.

557
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,968
Time to get rid of some pesky
little roaches.

558
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:45,533
Stop. Back two sectors.

559
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:48,298
Enhance.

560
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:55,175
They check in, but they do not
check out.

561
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:01,934
Systems override.

562
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:22,815
Still no response. Control,
I need help, I have a Mayday!

563
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:30,848
Control, you need to reply.
We are Alpha six!

564
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:35,132
Doctor, we have company.

565
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:37,495
Reference present position.
We are going in after him.

566
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:41,817
You have to help me.
Override the system!

567
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:56,255
Let's get out of here.

568
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:07,255
I lost frequency.
Help me out of here!

569
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:40,779
Two hours to Global Interface.

570
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:44,339
Give me access to all
credit accounts.

571
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:47,855
I am sorry,
your account is overdrawn.

572
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:50,494
This card is no longer valid.

573
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:52,254
ATM machins...

574
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:01,056
Department of Water and Power.

575
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:05,492
Reports of city wide civil
disturbances have been verified.

576
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:08,931
As the police department has gone
on full tactical alert.

577
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:11,455
But with automated system
failures occurring throughout...

578
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:14,811
the city, response is expected
to be slower than usual.

579
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:16,533
Already the violence has taken...

580
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:19,937
several lives and few see an end
to thecontinuing chaos.

581
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:25,097
Officials are reporting an
outbreak of looting and random...

582
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:28,212
myhem throughout the city,
nation and globe.

583
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:29,855
He has finished this city.

584
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:32,449
That's why he waited, so he could
offer an alternative.

585
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:33,888
People need hope.

586
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:37,297
If he can destroy our world,
we will have to turn to him...

587
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,377
a new Messiah in Cyberspace.

588
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:41,258
But you can not live
in Cyberspace.

589
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:43,178
Jobe can.

590
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:47,379
He can achieve global interface,
we won't have any choice.

591
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:51,693
- Egypt.
- Where they built the first dam.

592
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:55,132
- The chip is a dam.
Exactly.

593
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:03,774
Come to me all who have burdens.

594
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:05,494
I will set you free.

595
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:10,251
And you will no longer be the
children of a lost generation.

596
01:09:22,448 --> 01:09:25,281
It is time to take control
of the system!

597
01:09:26,648 --> 01:09:30,482
There shall be no more authority
to oppress you.

598
01:09:30,928 --> 01:09:32,646
We can all be the authority.

599
01:09:39,848 --> 01:09:43,682
Jack into a new world order.
Follow Jobe...

600
01:09:44,688 --> 01:09:46,246
Follow Jobe...

601
01:09:48,528 --> 01:09:53,158
Escape the violence and greed
that threatens to consume you.

602
01:09:54,888 --> 01:09:57,118
Come be one with your
fellow man.

603
01:09:58,408 --> 01:10:01,718
This is true spirituality.

604
01:10:10,968 --> 01:10:14,244
There shall be no more authority
to oppress you.

605
01:10:18,208 --> 01:10:20,881
World economic markets have been
taken some of the worst collapses

606
01:10:21,088 --> 01:10:22,237
in the history.

607
01:10:23,608 --> 01:10:26,839
Jonathon, I have some bad news
and I have some bad news.

608
01:10:36,528 --> 01:10:38,678
Where are you going?
Come back here!

609
01:10:42,848 --> 01:10:44,566
Stay here!
You can not go anywhere!

610
01:10:51,488 --> 01:10:52,807
Come on!

611
01:10:59,288 --> 01:11:01,722
Jobe, what the hell is going on?

612
01:11:02,128 --> 01:11:06,121
We have lost control. AII the lab
files are disappearing!

613
01:11:08,048 --> 01:11:10,403
Are you messing with me?

614
01:11:12,248 --> 01:11:13,522
Answer me.

615
01:11:14,368 --> 01:11:15,517
That is an order.

616
01:11:16,368 --> 01:11:18,723
You have no power to give orders.

617
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:23,203
In 100 years your petty financial
empire will not mean anything...

618
01:11:23,888 --> 01:11:25,116
but I'll still be here.

619
01:11:25,408 --> 01:11:26,682
You son of a bitch!

620
01:11:27,768 --> 01:11:30,441
Without me you are nothing but
a deaf and dumb cripple.

621
01:11:30,688 --> 01:11:33,646
I made you and I can unmake you.

622
01:11:41,848 --> 01:11:45,079
Twenty minutes to
Global Interface...

623
01:12:02,848 --> 01:12:05,442
You can't disconnect him.
Virtual Jobe will remain inside.

624
01:12:05,688 --> 01:12:10,079
You can either heavily sedate him
or take him out.

625
01:12:10,288 --> 01:12:11,687
If you want to take me out...

626
01:12:13,608 --> 01:12:15,121
just ask.

627
01:12:20,888 --> 01:12:22,560
Open the door, goddammit!

628
01:12:24,888 --> 01:12:26,003
Bastard!

629
01:12:31,688 --> 01:12:35,522
Alright. If that is the way
you want to play it.

630
01:12:40,688 --> 01:12:43,805
Prime alert. Security breach.

631
01:12:50,448 --> 01:12:52,643
Code Red. Code Red.

632
01:12:53,368 --> 01:12:57,247
All personnel will evacuate
the building immediately

633
01:12:57,968 --> 01:13:01,244
There are three terrorists
on the premises...

634
01:13:01,448 --> 01:13:05,202
fully armed and dangerous moving
down corridor 6D.

635
01:13:05,488 --> 01:13:08,844
Shoot on sight.
Repeat, shoot to kill.

636
01:13:09,048 --> 01:13:10,276
That son of a bitch.

637
01:13:10,488 --> 01:13:14,037
- Sir, there were terrorist here.
- We are the terrorists you idiot!

638
01:13:14,248 --> 01:13:15,363
Give me that gun.

639
01:13:21,928 --> 01:13:25,238
There are three terrorists on the
premises.

640
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:28,805
Shoot on sight.
Repeat, shoot to kill.

641
01:13:52,528 --> 01:13:54,758
Fifteen minutes to
Global Interface.

642
01:13:54,968 --> 01:13:56,367
Give yourselves to me.

643
01:13:56,768 --> 01:14:00,647
Your re-birth in the womb of
Cyberspace is a chance for a new

644
01:14:00,848 --> 01:14:02,725
beginning. To live in Eden...

645
01:14:02,968 --> 01:14:05,436
without hunger, without famine...

646
01:14:06,448 --> 01:14:08,484
without temptation!

647
01:14:15,648 --> 01:14:17,957
Ten minutes to Global Interface.

648
01:14:18,248 --> 01:14:21,046
We have got ten minutes, Cori,
you better watch the monitors...

649
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:23,045
Pull the real chip at the exact
moment you destroy the Virtual.

650
01:14:27,808 --> 01:14:28,923
Check it out, man.

651
01:14:29,248 --> 01:14:30,203
Let us look!

652
01:14:34,208 --> 01:14:36,483
If we can just jack in to that
dome unnoticed...

653
01:14:36,688 --> 01:14:40,727
No. Jobe knows all about
anyone who jacks into the dome.

654
01:14:41,048 --> 01:14:42,276
We have to find another way in.

655
01:14:42,488 --> 01:14:44,797
These are the routes for the
information superhighway...

656
01:14:45,008 --> 01:14:46,043
that lead directly into the dome.

657
01:14:47,128 --> 01:14:48,243
You do not have to jack in, Doc.

658
01:14:48,448 --> 01:14:50,200
You have a problem jacking
into VR?

659
01:14:50,768 --> 01:14:54,204
No, I will be fine. I am not
going to run away this time.

660
01:14:54,848 --> 01:14:56,406
Listen, guys...

661
01:14:56,688 --> 01:14:59,839
We are going to follow the
superhighway through the city...

662
01:15:00,088 --> 01:15:03,160
to where it goes underground all
the way into the dome.

663
01:15:03,488 --> 01:15:06,366
We'll take this access route
follow that up inside and

664
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:11,483
comes the tricky bit. We have to
get by Jobe and smash the chip.

665
01:15:11,688 --> 01:15:13,246
How are we going to get
through the city?

666
01:15:13,768 --> 01:15:15,724
Well, how about a little
bike ride?

667
01:15:17,088 --> 01:15:18,487
Okay, let's do it.

668
01:15:21,368 --> 01:15:24,246
Destroying the chip won't stop.
What do you really have in mind?

669
01:15:24,488 --> 01:15:28,367
The chip gave Jobe the power
to go on line.

670
01:15:28,568 --> 01:15:31,321
It contains a dam function to
prevent the use of absolute power

671
01:15:31,528 --> 01:15:34,361
We destroy the chip, we destroy
the dam and expose Jobe.

672
01:15:34,568 --> 01:15:37,082
I am going to make him angry
enough to destroy himself.

673
01:15:37,688 --> 01:15:39,201
Trace, we have to go!

674
01:15:39,568 --> 01:15:43,720
If you can not, get out, I don't
want you disappearing on me again

675
01:16:57,288 --> 01:17:01,122
You shall wait no more. The
Prophecy has already been fulled.

676
01:17:01,288 --> 01:17:07,079
For I have seen the Heavens and
a voice of the throne saving...

677
01:17:07,288 --> 01:17:12,078
There will be chaos in
the streets!

678
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:16,767
And in the final days, the
material world will fade away...

679
01:17:17,288 --> 01:17:19,848
and only Cyberspace will remain.

680
01:17:20,288 --> 01:17:23,644
In the womb of Cyberspace is a
chance for a new begining...

681
01:17:24,688 --> 01:17:27,156
to live in Eden without hunger...

682
01:17:27,448 --> 01:17:29,882
without famine. With me...

683
01:17:30,168 --> 01:17:34,241
you will find refuge.

684
01:17:46,688 --> 01:17:47,882
We came to save to you, Jobe.

685
01:17:48,608 --> 01:17:52,237
In here, I am the savior.

686
01:18:36,368 --> 01:18:38,324
I will crush you!

687
01:18:47,648 --> 01:18:49,320
You are just
thelawnmower man, Jobe.

688
01:18:52,448 --> 01:18:54,404
The lawnmower man is dead!

689
01:18:57,808 --> 01:18:58,558
By the way...

690
01:18:59,288 --> 01:19:02,917
I don't have to worry about Egypt
anymore. I simply built around it

691
01:19:17,928 --> 01:19:19,646
You destroyed Peter's world.

692
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:21,646
I am going to destroy yours.

693
01:19:22,288 --> 01:19:24,324
Six... five...

694
01:19:24,608 --> 01:19:26,405
...four... three...

695
01:19:27,288 --> 01:19:28,801
...two... one...

696
01:19:40,888 --> 01:19:45,166
You are a fool, Trace. I don't
need the Chyron chip anymore.

697
01:19:49,288 --> 01:19:51,677
I have become the chip.

698
01:19:52,088 --> 01:19:53,840
You've betrayed, Peter, Jobe.

699
01:19:54,088 --> 01:19:56,522
You have sold your soul
for nothing.

700
01:19:57,288 --> 01:19:59,518
You don't even have enough power
to destroy me.

701
01:20:09,928 --> 01:20:13,079
Is that all you have got, Jobe?
Is that all you have got?

702
01:20:15,448 --> 01:20:17,404
Is that the best you can do?

703
01:20:24,128 --> 01:20:29,486
What's... happening... to me?

704
01:20:30,088 --> 01:20:32,443
Egypt, Jobe. Egypt!

705
01:20:49,088 --> 01:20:52,239
Jobe, come here! Make a wish.

706
01:20:55,528 --> 01:20:57,086
Make a wish.

707
01:21:13,328 --> 01:21:14,317
We are back!

708
01:21:28,648 --> 01:21:32,641
Hey, my pal. Well done.

709
01:21:37,728 --> 01:21:39,081
I need to see Jobe.

710
01:21:40,848 --> 01:21:42,520
Okay. Let us go.

711
01:21:49,048 --> 01:21:50,117
There he is.

712
01:21:52,288 --> 01:21:53,562
Be careful.

713
01:21:58,288 --> 01:22:00,927
Probable pathways to interface...

714
01:22:01,248 --> 01:22:03,921
forty thousand... eighty four...

715
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:05,322
He's regressing.

716
01:22:16,888 --> 01:22:19,004
Well, isn't that touching?

717
01:22:20,568 --> 01:22:24,447
I want the chip. You can keep the
rest, for what is worth.

718
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:27,446
We will give you the chip,
give us the kid.

719
01:22:27,688 --> 01:22:31,158
I really dislike repeating myself

720
01:22:32,288 --> 01:22:33,357
Give him the chip.

721
01:22:41,408 --> 01:22:45,447
By the way, Doctor Platt,
you are fired.

722
01:23:25,728 --> 01:23:27,764
I though I lost you, man.

723
01:23:44,848 --> 01:23:46,361
Let's go home.
