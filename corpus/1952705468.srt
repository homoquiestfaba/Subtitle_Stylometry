1
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,337
Attention, all passengers...

2
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,176
... please do not leave
your luggage unattended.

3
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,181
This is for complete security
measures.

4
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:57,254
Unattended baggage will be collected
and searched by Security.

5
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:58,981
Thank you for your cooperation.

6
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:02,823
- Archer.
- The northbound arriving.

7
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:05,190
- You get on it.
- Is he alive?

8
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,660
Just get on the train.

9
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,482
Say, "Bye, Dad."

10
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,084
Bye, Dad.

11
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:51,103
- Yes?
- Next stop, you get off.

12
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,465
I need to know. Is he alive?

13
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,438
Just follow my instructions,
Mr. Archer.

14
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,271
- But...
- At the next stop, get off...

15
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,538
... switch to the red line.

16
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:28,232
Red line train south is now departing.
Please stand clear of the doors.

17
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:41,376
Red line train south now departing
at Platform B.

18
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,326
Red line train south now departing
at Platform B.

19
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,667
Next stop, Walnut Station.

20
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:58,666
Next stop, Walnut Station.

21
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:11,288
- In the van?
- That's correct, Mr. Archer.

22
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,055
And the bag?

23
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,359
It stays with you.

24
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,201
Put it on.

25
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:26,702
Well...

26
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,104
...we did it.

27
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,617
- You did it.
- Yeah.

28
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,916
The O.G.O. Complex is...

29
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,817
...well...

30
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:45,429
...it's this firm's crowning achievement
is what it is.

31
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:49,925
We went up against the biggest-shots
in this city. But you know what?

32
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:52,069
We landed it.

33
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,402
Now, there are many of you
to thank.

34
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,401
I am going to start with Tom Archer.

35
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,574
Tom, what can I say?

36
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:05,650
You know how I feel about you.

37
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,318
You are the man.

38
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,021
The work that you and your team did
on this design...

39
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:20,923
...is stunning.

40
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,931
Simply stunning. And I thank you.

41
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,559
Come here.

42
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,297
He's right, you know.

43
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:58,561
You are the man.

44
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,303
- It's good to be the man.
- Yeah.

45
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,771
Come here.

46
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:03,732
- Where is he?
- Through the looking glass, Mr. Archer.

47
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,931
We told the babysitter
we'd be home at midnight.

48
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,502
The babysitter will be fine.

49
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,937
Maybe we should just call.

50
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:21,511
You know what?
I will call her when I am done with you.

51
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,125
I love you.

52
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:35,119
We can see everything you do,
Mr. Archer.

53
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,755
So do exactly as you're told.

54
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,619
Leave the old key in the gym bag
in the room.

55
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:42,794
Then take the new key
and the flashlight.

56
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,690
Then go back into the hallway.

57
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,229
Good. Now take a left...

58
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:28,463
... and go to the end of the hallway
and down the stairs.

59
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,291
You should have called her.

60
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,363
Honey, she's 16. She will be fine.

61
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,133
Hey.

62
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,501
What?

63
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,302
The door is open.

64
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,735
Amy?

65
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,317
Amy.

66
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,364
Maybe she's up with Tyler.

67
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,231
Oh, my God.

68
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,140
Oh, my God.

69
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,214
- No. Tyler.
- Sarah. Sarah.

70
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,009
Sarah, call 911. Go. Go.

71
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,532
Tyler. Tyler?

72
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:24,948
Tom.

73
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,017
Tyler. No.

74
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:29,137
No.

75
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,654
Tom.

76
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:46,365
- Yes?
- Mr. Archer...

77
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:50,303
... this is the man
that murdered your son...

78
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,239
... and brutalized your wife.

79
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,044
You sure?

80
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,181
We have a positive match
to the blood and hair samples...

81
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,318
... taken from your home.

82
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,386
As you see, he's quite alive.

83
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,115
You will find everything
you could possibly need...

84
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,021
... in the room.

85
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:12,459
Remember, we're watching you.

86
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,786
Hi, Dad.

87
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:21,022
Do you remember this boy?

88
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,093
Look again.

89
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,096
Of course you don't.

90
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,603
But you will.

91
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,495
Don't worry about this.

92
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,721
I am just warming up.

93
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,204
I am going to ask you again.

94
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,141
Do you remember that boy?

95
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:20,585
You don't remember killing
my son, huh?

96
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,220
You're a fucking liar.

97
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:30,818
You attacked my wife.

98
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:36,092
- You feeling any better?
- My wife.

99
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,565
They have already taken her
to County General.

100
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,704
A police officer will give you a lift.

101
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,402
Mr. Archer, I know it doesn't seem
like the right time...

102
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,773
...but can you give me anything more
on the man who attacked you?

103
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,708
Anything?

104
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:52,883
How about the babysitter?
She have a boyfriend?

105
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,220
- Anything.
- I don't know.

106
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,752
I just want to see my wife.

107
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,127
Hey.

108
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,607
It's hot.

109
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,508
Well, give it a minute.

110
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:02,582
Mr. Archer, I am sorry to intrude
but do you have a minute?

111
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:06,249
I really shouldn't be here
telling you this...

112
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:10,461
...but if what happened to you
happened to me, I'd want to know.

113
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:12,858
What? What's going on?

114
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,597
I have been reassigned to another unit.

115
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,796
Okay, so who's your replacement?

116
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,276
Well, that's just it, sir.
There is no replacement.

117
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,205
With budget cuts, the department...

118
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:30,807
...we're short of manpower.

119
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:32,808
Is it officially unsolved?

120
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,350
What about my son? My wife?

121
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:39,354
Well, it won't be official. It's just
no one's assigned to the case anymore.

122
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:42,115
It will just go away.

123
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,522
But how can you do that?

124
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,122
I am really very sorry, Mr. Archer.

125
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,028
It's a lousy thing.

126
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:55,662
Wait.

127
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:00,367
If I were you,
you know what I would do?

128
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:06,916
I'd dedicate my life
to finding that piece of shit.

129
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:10,644
Every penny, every resource,
everything and anything.

130
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:13,686
I'd find him...

131
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:15,320
...roast him on a spit.

132
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,338
If you need something, anything...

133
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,164
...give me a call.

134
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,387
Look what you have done.

135
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:05,201
I need some time.

136
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,606
Away.

137
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:10,773
To be alone for a while.

138
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:14,549
Every time I look at you, I see him.

139
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:21,185
It's killing me.

140
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:35,734
You're going to pay.

141
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,909
You're going to pay.

142
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,339
I am going to put this
through your goddamn skull.

143
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,257
Not yet.

144
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,974
Look at me.

145
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:22,252
Look at me.

146
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,857
All right.

147
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:29,117
That's fine, tough guy.

148
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,158
We got plenty of time.

149
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,165
Look at me.

150
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,030
Look at me.

151
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,506
You are going to die.

152
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,514
Now look at me.

153
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:55,513
Good.

154
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,692
- This is bullshit.
- Mr. Archer.

155
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,363
- Detective.
- I got this, fellas.

156
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,897
Mr. Archer, you're upset.
Let's take a seat.

157
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,331
You come to my house and you drop
a fucking bomb on me like that?

158
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:13,765
Mr. Archer.

159
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:15,030
I am a good man.

160
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,209
I follow the rules.
I do everything I am supposed to do.

161
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,038
I have never had a speeding ticket
and this is what I get?

162
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,907
You call yourself cops?

163
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:24,547
I tried to explain.

164
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,546
Look, no. My wife.

165
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:30,448
This has destroyed her.
And... do something.

166
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:32,280
- My hands are tied.
- They're tied?

167
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:33,889
Do your fucking job.

168
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,560
Mr. Archer, think about
what's really going on.

169
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,193
Find me the man.

170
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,724
You punched a cop?

171
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:18,066
I tried to.

172
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,596
- You realize how that sounds?
- You don't understand.

173
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,298
No, and I don't pretend
to understand.

174
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,574
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

175
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:33,111
But, Tom, you need to ask yourself
if what you're doing is helping.

176
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:35,682
You haven't been into the office
in three months.

177
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,251
Hey, then fire me.

178
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:40,853
I am not going to fire you.

179
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:42,993
This isn't about your job.

180
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:45,928
I want you to take
all the time you need.

181
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:48,156
Then I want you back.

182
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,894
But I can't use you like this.

183
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,799
Tom, I think you need help.

184
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:57,634
I am fine.

185
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,673
You're fine?

186
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,509
Take a look around you, Tom.

187
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,639
I am bailing you out of jail.

188
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:17,885
Listen. The desk sergeant said
the detective you took a swing at...

189
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:20,690
...won't press charges
if you agree to get counseling.

190
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:25,565
- A psychiatrist?
- Yeah.

191
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,164
The department uses him...

192
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,864
...for officers and fire-fighters
who have been through traumatic events.

193
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,637
Call him.

194
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,374
Rise and shine.

195
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,981
Let's try the other one.

196
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:11,240
- Yes.
- Are you okay, Mr. Archer?

197
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:14,104
- Is everything to your satisfaction?
- I don't know.

198
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:16,772
Do you need assistance?

199
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,539
I just need a minute.

200
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:43,437
Is everything all right?

201
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,802
I don't think so. No.

202
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,501
What seems to be the problem?

203
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,441
I don't think this is the man
who murdered my son.

204
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:59,221
There is no doubt he is the man.

205
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:02,188
Why do you think it's not him?

206
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,323
The tattoo.

207
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,996
He had a tattoo on his wrist.

208
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:07,489
A tattoo?

209
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:11,362
In all your statements to the police
you never once mentioned a tattoo.

210
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:13,628
- I know. I just remem...
- This is the man.

211
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:17,330
Our investigation was thorough and
state-of-the-art forensics confirms it.

212
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,531
We have to stop this.

213
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:22,042
Once you begin,
there's no turning back.

214
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:26,408
That was our agreement, Mr. Archer.
You said you understood.

215
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:27,913
What if he's the wrong guy?

216
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:31,815
What you're experiencing
is not unusual.

217
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:34,491
- I want to speak with him.
- Speak with whom?

218
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:36,683
The man I have been torturing.

219
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,057
That is not allowed.

220
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,427
- I am going to talk to him.
- Wait a moment.

221
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:46,330
Let me call Dr. Heller.

222
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,146
Who are you?

223
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:04,650
Please.

224
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,683
Who are you?

225
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:10,555
I haven't done anything.

226
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,787
Why are you here?

227
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,101
Why are you here?

228
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:20,097
I don't know.

229
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:22,637
Why do you think you're here?

230
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,671
I don't know.

231
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:26,301
I don't know.

232
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:27,944
You don't know?

233
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:30,273
How did you get here?

234
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:32,815
Two men...

235
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,945
...jumped me.

236
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:38,282
Threw a hood over my head...

237
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:41,917
...and I wake up in this chair.

238
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,118
That's all I know.

239
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,290
I am really sorry...

240
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:52,469
...what happened to your wife...

241
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:55,105
...and your kid.

242
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,934
But it wasn't me.

243
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:02,443
You got the wrong man.

244
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:05,441
You got the wrong man.

245
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:11,647
Don't you fucking lie to me.

246
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,657
I am not.

247
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,666
- What?
- Dr. Heller is on the line.

248
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,838
- I have no idea.
- I left five messages.

249
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,940
- You can't wait in his office.
- I don't care. I am going to wait.

250
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:33,508
You already said that l...
We both know it already.

251
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:36,771
I am going inside. I need to see him.
I need to see him.

252
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:40,148
Well, I wasn't expecting you.

253
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,150
Sorry if I kept you waiting.

254
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:44,821
You didn't. It's not my day.

255
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,547
- I am not supposed to be here.
- Nonsense.

256
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:49,385
- How are you progressing?
- I am not.

257
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,628
Nothing has changed.

258
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,990
I don't feel any better.

259
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:57,560
I am all talked out.
I have run out of words.

260
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:01,330
I have been coming to you
for three months.

261
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:05,339
Every time I come here,
it feels like the first day.

262
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,636
It's always today.

263
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:11,508
And what about tomorrow?

264
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,045
Tomorrow, my son
is still going to be dead.

265
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:19,647
Tomorrow, maybe my wife
will be gone.

266
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:26,690
I don't know what to do.

267
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,371
Let's take a walk.

268
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:36,371
Off the meter.

269
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:40,704
You have reason to feel the way you do
and your anger is completely justified.

270
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,779
There's a lot of evil at work
in this world...

271
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:47,212
...and in my practice
I see it all the time.

272
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,545
Too often it goes...

273
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,881
...unpunished.

274
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:55,585
If there was a way...

275
00:34:56,461 --> 00:35:00,955
...to find out
and punish the man who did it...

276
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,936
...would you be prepared
to go all the way?

277
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,800
All the way?

278
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:13,841
What I am about to say
may surprise you...

279
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:16,736
...considering it comes from me.

280
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,749
I am listening.

281
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:27,580
In cases such as yours, I find...

282
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,920
Bizarre as it may sound.

283
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:37,126
That there is only one way to exorcise
those demons that torment you.

284
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:39,493
What is it?

285
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:43,968
Putting you and him
in the same room...

286
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,969
...alone.

287
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,809
And the rest is up to you.

288
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,474
How could you do that?

289
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:56,584
Oh, it can be done.

290
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:58,448
It's expensive.

291
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,783
Not without risks.

292
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,352
But it can be done.

293
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:06,359
Hello, it's Dr. Heller.

294
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:07,622
We got a problem.

295
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,995
I am on my way to see you right now.
Do nothing till I get there.

296
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:12,692
Do nothing? Too late.

297
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:14,837
This business about the tattoo...

298
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,768
... talk to me about it.

299
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:20,273
The man who attacked me had a tattoo
on his right wrist. He doesn't.

300
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:23,106
Well, it sounds like your subconscious
is at work here.

301
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:24,508
No, that's not it.

302
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:26,546
I know he had a tattoo. I know it.

303
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:30,016
Now, wait, wait, wait.
Just listen to me, please.

304
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:31,813
You must be careful.

305
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,820
They're watching
every move you make.

306
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,823
Now, sit tight. I am on my way.
We will work this out.

307
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,120
I promise you.

308
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:39,728
All right.

309
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,625
Just hurry.

310
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,434
Please.

311
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:51,000
Could you take the nail out?

312
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:00,751
This is going to hurt.

313
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:43,987
Now what?

314
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:46,856
We wait for my shrink.

315
00:37:47,064 --> 00:37:50,761
A package will arrive at your home.
Inside will be a cell phone.

316
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:54,233
Charge it up, turn it on
and then you wait.

317
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:57,566
A call could come that night
or next week or even in six months...

318
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,208
...but it will come.

319
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:03,039
And then you must follow
their instructions to the letter.

320
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:07,047
It's very important that you never
waver, and do exactly as you're told.

321
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:08,980
These men are to be respected.

322
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:11,711
They are very serious people...

323
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,015
...and they believe in what they do.

324
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:15,416
Who are they?

325
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:19,153
They prefer to maintain
an extremely low-profile existence.

326
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:22,423
Doc, I am paying a lot of money
for this.

327
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,157
Who are they?

328
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:28,433
Well, let's just say
that they're composed of former...

329
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,802
...and I believe current
law-enforcement officials...

330
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:34,273
...who share one interest in common.

331
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,503
They want to see justice done.

332
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:40,241
They see a legal system
that is failing miserably every day.

333
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:41,782
It's their city.

334
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:47,117
They want to rid it of the kind of scum
that destroyed your family.

335
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,623
You can understand that.

336
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,256
So that's it?

337
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:57,161
I mean...

338
00:38:57,368 --> 00:39:00,303
...when do I see you next?
- That's entirely up to you.

339
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:05,435
But I do believe, for the moment,
that's it.

340
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:09,004
Now, don't try and fool yourself.

341
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:11,773
None of this
is going to bring back your son.

342
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:16,976
But when you realize that what you did
had to be done and you walk away...

343
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:20,516
...you will know that the book
has been closed forever.

344
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,886
You can get on with your life.

345
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:26,357
And...

346
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:31,962
...good luck, Tom.

347
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:47,181
- Yes.
- Stop breaking the rules, Mr. Archer.

348
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,818
Where's Heller?

349
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,850
- Enough, already.
- Just bring me Heller.

350
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,615
Put his gag back on.

351
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:57,056
Just bring me Heller.

352
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:20,074
Could you...?

353
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:23,248
Could you get me out of this
fucking chair, please?

354
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:25,422
You know I can't.

355
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:31,354
- I am innocent. You know that.
- I don't know shit.

356
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:33,221
Yes, you do.

357
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,093
- You just said it yourself.
- Shut up.

358
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:40,663
Who the fuck are you?

359
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:43,434
Who made you God?

360
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,378
The man who took my son.

361
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:51,237
That wasn't me.

362
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,717
Archer, this is Dr. Heller.

363
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,147
Let me in, please.

364
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:58,321
- Are you alone?
- Yes, I am alone.

365
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:01,116
Just open the door, please.

366
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,063
- Do you know what you're doing?
- I don't.

367
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:10,222
You took his gag off and the camera.

368
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:12,266
- Why?
- Time.

369
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,995
- I need to talk.
- They're concerned, Tom.

370
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,503
- They're very concerned.
- I don't think it's him.

371
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,766
Maybe the stress
has been too much for you.

372
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,605
- But this is truly the man.
- No, I am not.

373
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,249
I am a father just like you.

374
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:27,678
I don't belong here.

375
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:29,182
Listen, listen, my friend.

376
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:33,618
They have assured me that this is
the man who destroyed your family.

377
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,759
They assured you?
What the hell does that even mean?

378
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:38,588
How are they sure?
How do they know?

379
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,998
All right. All right.

380
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:52,137
Here's what I do know.

381
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:56,211
He's a career criminal,
a repeat offender, a killer.

382
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:57,471
A paid killer.

383
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,649
They compile lists
of such individuals...

384
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,977
...individuals who have escaped
from justice.

385
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,177
They track them, they monitor them.

386
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:06,822
Did he tell you that he was picked up
off a street?

387
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,787
Plucked like an apple from a tree?

388
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:11,451
Oh, no. No, no.

389
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:15,359
That man has deserved everything
you gave him tonight.

390
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,367
That I can guarantee.

391
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:23,071
You came here to right a wrong.

392
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,705
Yes?

393
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,202
Well, this is your enemy.

394
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,642
He deserves to die.

395
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:32,338
All right.

396
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:33,908
All right.

397
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:38,248
I am no saint whatsoever.

398
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:40,252
But I don't kill kids.

399
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:42,220
I don't beat women.

400
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:45,259
And I don't have a fucking tattoo.

401
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:47,896
I have a son I love very much.

402
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:50,225
I am a mechanic, that's it.

403
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:52,095
That's who I am.

404
00:42:57,274 --> 00:42:59,868
They have got my 500,000.
Tell them to keep the money.

405
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,408
That's fine with me.

406
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:04,274
But I paid for this and it ends
when I say so.

407
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:07,075
Oh, no, no, it's far too late for that.

408
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,878
My dear friend, don't you realize...

409
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,920
...that what's been set in motion here
can't be stopped?

410
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:16,251
They're not going to let
the two of you just walk out of here.

411
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,861
I have told you, these people are serious,
deadly serious.

412
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:23,260
Even if he wasn't the guy,
they don't care.

413
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:26,102
As far as they're concerned,
he's guilty.

414
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:28,897
And he is, or he wouldn't be here.

415
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:32,465
And admit it.

416
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:38,979
In that moment when he was
the bastard that took your child...

417
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,949
...you felt empowered, didn't you?

418
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,050
Yes.

419
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:50,121
You felt a release for the first time.

420
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:52,454
You felt complete.

421
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,856
Am I right?

422
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:58,734
Yes.

423
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:03,070
Then finish it.

424
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,367
Take back your life.

425
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:25,657
I'd like to do this alone.

426
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:50,482
Please.

427
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:54,714
It's a mistake.

428
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,941
Tom?

429
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,809
Tom?

430
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,083
Good God.

431
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:28,590
What have you done?

432
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:34,754
They will kill you for this, Tom.

433
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:37,358
They're professionals.

434
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:38,727
That's what they do.

435
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,965
Have you ever fired a gun before?

436
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:48,037
- No.
- If you want to live...

437
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:51,544
...and see your wife again,
you put that gun down and walk out.

438
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:52,773
Call them.

439
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:56,778
That is not a good idea.

440
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,510
Call them.

441
00:45:58,722 --> 00:46:01,247
Tell them they can keep my money.
But he goes with me.

442
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,892
Tom, I am on your side.

443
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,426
I can make this work
if you just listen to sense.

444
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:13,400
Explain to them this situation.

445
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,932
Oh, this is madness.

446
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:22,577
Just madness.

447
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:26,777
Yes.

448
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,279
Yes.

449
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,478
He wants to leave.

450
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:33,315
With him.

451
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,556
Oh, yes, I explained that.

452
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,163
Very well, I will tell him.

453
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:46,627
Listen, they're still on the line.

454
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:49,771
They're prepared to let you go.

455
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:52,407
Alone. Now.

456
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:55,408
Listen to me.

457
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:58,940
You will never
leave this building alive.

458
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,275
Never.

459
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:02,508
Take the offer and go.

460
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:05,153
You haven't seen them.
You can't identify them.

461
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:07,289
Right this minute, you're no threat.

462
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,619
But if you take this further,
that will not be the case.

463
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,193
Why can't we just go?

464
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:16,332
We're not going to say anything.
We're not going to call the cops.

465
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:20,832
You haven't been listening, have you?
These are the cops.

466
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,098
No.

467
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,879
- I am taking him with me.
- Oh, Tom, for God's sake.

468
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,451
Tell them.

469
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:45,358
Tell them you accept the offer.

470
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,860
To buy time. He's right.

471
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:55,633
If you say we're leaving,
they're going to come and kill us both.

472
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:09,344
Okay.

473
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:14,914
He agrees. Alone.

474
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:19,023
Give me a minute. I will call you back.

475
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:25,694
Now what?

476
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:29,732
Lock the door.

477
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:42,114
You're good with a bat.

478
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,186
How good are you
with a sledgehammer?

479
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,864
I don't think
you're going to make it, Tom.

480
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:04,866
- How many of them are there?
- Five or six, at least.

481
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,771
We got to go.

482
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:13,209
Come on, come on, quickly.

483
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:24,560
- So, what happens to you?
- I don't know.

484
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:26,592
I will manage somehow.

485
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:42,275
Mr. Archer.

486
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:45,577
- Mr. Archer, open the door.
- Open the door.

487
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:50,710
Mr. Archer, open up this door now.

488
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:03,733
Come on.

489
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:08,004
Keep moving.

490
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:13,376
Bring that son of a bitch out.

491
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,311
Move it.

492
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:24,313
Move.

493
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:48,377
- They killed Heller.
- Forget it.

494
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:51,741
Hey, can you call out
on your phone?

495
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:52,698
No.

496
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:56,248
- Did they give it to you?
- Yeah.

497
00:50:56,453 --> 00:51:00,890
Destroy it. They can track us with it.
They come with GPS.

498
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:18,571
Come here. Help me.

499
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:04,945
We have to get out of here.

500
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:14,863
Okay.

501
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:53,535
- Let me have your gun.
- What?

502
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:55,432
- Give me the gun.
- No.

503
00:52:58,508 --> 00:52:59,532
Give it to me, please.

504
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:03,808
You said you don't know
how to use it. I do.

505
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:10,908
I am not going to point it at you.
I am going to point it at them.

506
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:13,183
Trust me.

507
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:17,023
Give me the gun.

508
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:25,066
Thank you.

509
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,337
Get down.

510
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:11,571
Get the gun.

511
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:56,289
Where are they?

512
00:54:57,427 --> 00:55:01,386
They're down there.
And they lost a weapon.

513
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:04,832
They have to think about this
for a little while.

514
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:11,631
You're pretty good with a gun
for a mechanic.

515
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:15,811
Lucky shot.

516
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:47,935
So, what do we do now?

517
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:59,108
You motherfucker. I should fuck you up
for what you did to me tonight.

518
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:01,215
I should fuck you up big-time.

519
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:05,047
- I thought that...
- You thought? Right. You did not know.

520
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:07,386
You thought.

521
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,416
- They told me...
- They told you?

522
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:13,722
You were going to kill me
for what someone else told you?

523
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,391
Something you wanted
to believe so bad.

524
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,533
And I would have fucking died for it.

525
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:22,299
Now.

526
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:26,106
Tell me, how does it feel?

527
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:31,280
How does it feel?

528
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:33,311
You're right.

529
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:37,183
For what happened to my family,
I would have killed you.

530
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:40,313
Go ahead.

531
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:44,887
Kill me. You have earned it.

532
00:57:58,007 --> 00:57:59,099
All right.

533
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,088
I need a break.

534
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:51,916
You said you had a son?

535
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:54,079
Yeah.

536
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:57,225
What's his name?

537
00:59:58,361 --> 01:00:00,261
Stephen.

538
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,095
How old is he?

539
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:06,728
He's 7, I think. No.

540
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:10,030
Wait. He's... He's 9.

541
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:11,968
He's 9.

542
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:16,104
Do you live with him?

543
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:17,863
No.

544
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:24,350
When is the last time you saw him?

545
01:00:24,587 --> 01:00:26,350
Come on.

546
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,623
I don't think this
is any of your business.

547
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:35,589
- I was just...
- Just drop it.

548
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:41,168
We need each other to get out of here
but that's where it ends.

549
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:44,066
No more questions.
No more bullshit.

550
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:45,638
No more small talk, okay?

551
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,304
Okay.

552
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:50,239
Good.

553
01:00:53,516 --> 01:00:55,279
What time is it?

554
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:01,586
It's almost 3:00.

555
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:11,397
When they brought you in,
did you see the size of the place?

556
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:17,804
It's huge. It's some sort of
abandoned industrial complex.

557
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:21,309
Did you see anything else?

558
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:26,504
They had a hood over my head
until I got outside.

559
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:29,313
So nothing else?

560
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:31,877
Just...

561
01:01:32,088 --> 01:01:34,989
...they have got security cameras
everywhere.

562
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:37,718
Your friend said...

563
01:01:38,394 --> 01:01:41,693
...that there's,
like, six of them, right?

564
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:43,695
He said there were five or six.

565
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:46,662
Four, maybe five.

566
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:49,499
That's good.

567
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:52,637
Why is that good?

568
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:56,510
Five people can never lock
this place down.

569
01:01:59,415 --> 01:02:01,542
That's why it's good.

570
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:09,248
Did you see anything
when they brought you in?

571
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:11,685
I told you back in the room.

572
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:16,554
- I wasn't lying.
- I didn't say you were.

573
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:19,027
Right.

574
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:26,267
You seem to know
how these guys think.

575
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:29,039
They play it the way I'd play it.

576
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:30,837
It's common sense.

577
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,605
For you, maybe. Not for me.

578
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:45,126
Maybe we should just stay here.
We have got cover.

579
01:02:45,328 --> 01:02:47,592
We just wait and pick them off.

580
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:51,393
Wait for them to come?

581
01:02:51,634 --> 01:02:54,603
Well, what if they don't come?

582
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:58,066
You said this place is abandoned.

583
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:00,872
We stay in this room...

584
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:03,068
... we die in this room.

585
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:06,873
Our only chance is to get moving.

586
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:08,675
We have to find a way out of here.

587
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:20,027
What's your ETA down there?

588
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:23,164
Roger that now.

589
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:57,127
Stay.

590
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:48,175
- Are you almost done?
- Give me five.

591
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:31,645
You want this back?

592
01:06:36,058 --> 01:06:37,923
I will take this one.

593
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:47,931
Get the radio.

594
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:53,937
Unit 5.

595
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:57,536
Five, do you read me?

596
01:06:58,781 --> 01:07:02,046
Five, if you can read me,
you're squelching, over.

597
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:23,463
What is this, a bomb?

598
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:25,173
Sort of.

599
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:28,502
It's gasoline.
They want to burn us out.

600
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,816
Hey, hey. Do you know
what you're doing?

601
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:39,771
No.

602
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:43,290
I was a soldier once.

603
01:07:43,959 --> 01:07:46,484
So close your eyes.

604
01:07:57,573 --> 01:07:59,598
Where do we go now?

605
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:02,706
I have no idea.

606
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:20,519
Archer.

607
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:22,616
Archer.

608
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:30,024
This has gone far enough. If you
cooperate now, we will let you go.

609
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:34,593
Mr. Archer, come out now and live.
We want what's best.

610
01:09:34,803 --> 01:09:37,294
Come out and we will finish
what you started.

611
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:45,643
Mr. Archer.

612
01:10:07,336 --> 01:10:09,201
Go. Go.

613
01:10:34,597 --> 01:10:37,930
Mr. Archer, your time is up.

614
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:40,033
Do you understand me?

615
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:17,802
Mr. Archer, no more fucking around.

616
01:11:22,177 --> 01:11:25,203
- You're all right?
- Yeah, you?

617
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:29,611
If you don't come out now...

618
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:33,254
...after we kill you,
we're going to kill your wife.

619
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:37,421
Do you understand me?

620
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:39,491
You are your wife's only hope.

621
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:42,664
Show yourself and you're going to
end up like Heller back there.

622
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:47,268
Mr. Archer,
am I talking to a dead man?

623
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:50,495
When they come at us...

624
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:53,106
...just use short bursts, okay?

625
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:16,114
What happened?

626
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:18,893
I hit him.

627
01:13:19,294 --> 01:13:22,730
You think? Or are you sure?

628
01:13:23,532 --> 01:13:25,159
I got him.

629
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:27,558
Good.

630
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:35,773
Hey, you're all right, you're alive
and we're almost done here.

631
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:40,044
There's maybe three or two left.

632
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:43,416
And one is back down there
but he's hurt.

633
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:46,179
I got him in the neck.

634
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:51,791
Hey, I am not moving anywhere.

635
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:56,254
So it's all on you now.

636
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:01,361
Together, we can manage
to get out of here.

637
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,165
But, first, you have to finish him off.

638
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:12,671
Okay?

639
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:21,983
Now move.

640
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:04,022
Why?

641
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:06,666
Why did you do this?

642
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:08,666
You wanted justice.

643
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:10,998
You wanted me to find the man,
remember?

644
01:15:11,807 --> 01:15:13,434
It wasn't him.

645
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:18,272
Fuck you. He's a piece of shit.
I gave you a way out.

646
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,347
You had an opportunity
to find peace...

647
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:25,611
...and make the world a better place
at the same time for everyone else.

648
01:15:25,821 --> 01:15:27,015
You fucked it up.

649
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:30,851
You fucked up everything.

650
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:35,128
Don't.

651
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:38,898
You can't do it.

652
01:15:40,435 --> 01:15:41,993
Don't.

653
01:15:43,438 --> 01:15:45,269
You're not going to do it.

654
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:52,077
Fucking coward.

655
01:16:29,151 --> 01:16:30,618
Here.

656
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:33,087
I got you a present.

657
01:16:34,056 --> 01:16:35,853
What about you?

658
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:38,620
I can run, you can't.

659
01:16:40,629 --> 01:16:42,256
Thank you.

660
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:55,186
Oh, my God.

661
01:19:20,455 --> 01:19:22,082
Do you remember this boy?

662
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:25,052
You don't remember killing my son?

663
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:27,091
- You got to help me.
- Come here, sweetie.

664
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:29,126
Help me.
What am I supposed to do?

665
01:19:30,031 --> 01:19:32,556
I don't think this is the man
who murdered my son.

666
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:36,260
- Your turn, tiger. Say, "Bye, Daddy."
- Bye, Dad.

667
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:51,380
Your son.

668
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:55,518
I could not imagine.

669
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:08,593
They want me dead
and they used you.

670
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:12,398
I am really sorry.

671
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:20,639
Who are you, really?

672
01:20:25,587 --> 01:20:27,646
You don't want to know.

673
01:20:42,103 --> 01:20:44,435
You have a beautiful son.

674
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:48,967
Yeah.

675
01:20:56,918 --> 01:20:59,079
We got to get out of here.

676
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:20,674
Hey, come here.

677
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:22,471
I found another one.

678
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:25,671
Shit.

679
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:27,007
Go.

680
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,813
Come on. Come on.

681
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:39,126
Move.

682
01:22:52,334 --> 01:22:53,767
Is that what this is about?

683
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,997
This is about the money?

684
01:22:57,038 --> 01:23:02,499
Well, which answer do you want?
The real one?

685
01:23:04,446 --> 01:23:07,438
Or the one you prefer to hear?

686
01:23:11,252 --> 01:23:14,187
No, it's me. Kill them.
They're down there. Down the tunnel.

687
01:23:14,389 --> 01:23:17,586
- Well, I wasn't expecting you.
- You must be careful.

688
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:19,692
They're watching every move
you make.

689
01:23:19,894 --> 01:23:21,452
Have you tried counseling?

690
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:24,598
The detective won't press charges
if you agree to counseling.

691
01:23:24,799 --> 01:23:27,199
There is only one way
to exorcise those demons.

692
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:30,269
- Are you prepared to go all the way?
- Stress is too much.

693
01:23:30,472 --> 01:23:33,270
This is your enemy. This is the man.
Tom, I am on your side.

694
01:23:33,475 --> 01:23:36,171
This is the man
who destroyed your family.

695
01:23:36,378 --> 01:23:38,972
These are the cops.
They will kill you for this, Tom.

696
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:40,772
Finish it.

697
01:23:40,982 --> 01:23:42,472
Take back your life.

698
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:49,350
I am the man that cleans up after you.

699
01:23:50,158 --> 01:23:52,285
We work behind the scenes.

700
01:23:52,494 --> 01:23:53,688
We create justice...

701
01:23:53,895 --> 01:23:58,992
...all in the name of making
our city a safer, better place.

702
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:02,363
But you live in a bubble.

703
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:07,701
And when that safe,
sanctimonious bubble bursts...

704
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:12,505
...what do you do?
You scream for justice.

705
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:15,546
Now, this man...

706
01:24:16,418 --> 01:24:18,818
...this is a bad man.

707
01:24:20,388 --> 01:24:22,982
If it wasn't your son he killed...

708
01:24:23,191 --> 01:24:24,419
...it was somebody else's.

709
01:24:24,626 --> 01:24:26,389
And what do you do?

710
01:24:26,594 --> 01:24:30,997
You put him straight back
on the streets.

711
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:34,163
So I ask you, Tom Archer...

712
01:24:35,837 --> 01:24:38,169
...where's the difference?

713
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:01,021
I don't need to kill you.

714
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:03,127
You're already dead.

715
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:29,287
You really wanted to sit at home
with your wife...

716
01:25:29,491 --> 01:25:32,949
...and wait for him to come
and kill you both?

717
01:26:02,790 --> 01:26:04,087
Take it.

718
01:26:06,427 --> 01:26:08,122
If I wanted that fucking bag...

719
01:26:08,329 --> 01:26:11,594
...you think I'd ask your permission
to take it?

720
01:26:23,478 --> 01:26:25,173
Thank you.

721
01:30:01,929 --> 01:30:03,658
Come here.

722
01:30:09,904 --> 01:30:14,841
Say, "Bye, Daddy. I love you."

723
01:30:45,306 --> 01:30:47,240
Do you remember this little boy?

724
01:30:49,143 --> 01:30:49,893
No?

725
01:30:59,487 --> 01:31:01,284
Do you know what you did
to his family?

726
01:31:01,489 --> 01:31:04,049
You know what you almost did
to mine?

727
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:06,484
You little fuck.
