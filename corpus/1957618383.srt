Say that son, say that.

10
00:00:46,067 --> 00:00:48,333
I just love to make a
broad moan and cry.

00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:49,900
Easy baby.

12
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:52,333
I used to be young,
dumb, and full of cum

Ow!

21
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:20,333
I fucked an ape in a cape, a
goat in a coat, a cat in a hat

22
00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:22,767
and a pig in a wig.

23

You know what?

24
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:27,933
I fucked Siamese twins.

25
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,267
They were joined at they spine.

26
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,633
Look out, son!

[Funk Music Playing]

44
00:02:24,633 --> 00:02:27,333
I was born in Fort
Smith, Arkansas but I

45
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:28,800
migrated

46
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:32,067
to Cleveland, Ohio in
my teenage years.

47
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,833
Grew up in Cleveland,
went to the Army.

48
00:02:34,867 --> 00:02:37,700
Come out at the age of 22.

49
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:42,800
Then I migrated to Los Angeles
in search for a singing career.

00:02:44,467 --> 00:02:47,433
[Fast Drum Music]

51
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,500
My first performing
career was an

52
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:52,333
interpretive dancer.

53
00:02:52,367 --> 00:02:55,867
That is someone that dances
to the jungle drums, and

54
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,433
they do work with African
rhythms and, uh,

55
00:02:59,467 --> 00:03:02,500
Hindu rhythms. I
was that type of a

56
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:05,100
dancer. And then we
called it adagio

57
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:07,633
dancing also.

* You gotta step it
up and go, yeah

60
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:17,067
My first singing
career started on

61
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,200
King Federal Records.

62
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:22,133
I was produced by one of the

63
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:24,700
great producers of that
time, Mr. Ran Bast.

64
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:28,667
I did a record called
"Step it Up and Go".

65
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,333
That almost got to be a hit.

66
00:03:31,367 --> 00:03:34,133
And I made records
for Dooto records.

67
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:37,567
That's a re-label that
started Redd Foxx.

68
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,733
Dootsie Williams was the, uh,

69
00:03:39,767 --> 00:03:42,733
owner of the label. He'd
come to the California
Club and sold me on

70
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:44,567
stage workin' and asked me

71
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,833
to be a record for his label.

72
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:49,367
I did a record called
"Bellow the Belt".

73
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,067
Another one called
"Let's Come Together".

74
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,767
Neither one of them made it.

75
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,333
And I want this to be
known by the world

76
00:03:57,367 --> 00:04:00,400
that I was not able
to make it in my

77
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:03,133
singing career and
had great, great song

78
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:05,067
because I was hid

79
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:06,700
behind

80
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:08,933
singers like Pat Boone

81
00:04:08,967 --> 00:04:11,667
and other white singers that

82
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,200
had the airwaves.

83
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:16,500
And I was not able to get
a break at that time.

This is Rudy Ray Moore

87
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:32,067
I am at the record center
of the west, which is

88
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,133
Dolphin's of Hollywood.

89
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:38,067
Two locations. I am at the
one on Vernon and Central.

90
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:40,433
I worked at a record
store because

91
00:04:40,467 --> 00:04:43,433
uh, I wanted to get into the
record business and learn

92
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:45,733
how to manufacture
and produce records.

93
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:48,700
The man that I worked
for was John Dolphin of

94
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:50,233
Dolphin's of Hollywood.

95
00:04:50,267 --> 00:04:54,300
And he taught me the ropes
of how to produce a record.

96
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:57,300
Then I started making
my own masters

97
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,533
and producing my own records.

98
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:02,700
In other words, I'd
been self made, uh,

99
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:04,200
all of my whole career.

100
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:07,133
I first hear the
Dolemite from a wino.

101
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:10,400
I was working in Dolphin's at
Hollywood as their management.

102
00:05:10,433 --> 00:05:13,400
There was a wino
come in named Rico.

103
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:16,400
And he wanted, uh,
me to give him

104
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:18,600
some money for soup.

105
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:20,333
'Cause he didn't have any teeth.

106
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:23,467
So I told him I said used to
hear him on the street corners

107
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,467
doing all of these raps and
rhymes and so forth.

108
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,867
I says "Rico, you do
Dolemite, I'm gonna give you
some money for some soup."

109
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,367
He did Dolemite in the middle
of the floor of the store
where I was working and

110
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,167
people just rolled.

111
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,967
So, I thought then I
said "now, he's not

112
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:42,400
a professional, I'm not a
professional comedian."

113
00:05:42,433 --> 00:05:44,067
"What if I...

114
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:46,700
did Dolemite?" And sure enough

115
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:50,200
I invited him to my house
to give him a little
reefer and some wine.

116
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:52,367
He put Dolemite on tape.

117
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,367
I recorded it. And the
rest is history.

118
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,367
"Some folks say
that Willie Green

119
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,333
was the baddest motherfucker the

120
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:05,067

121
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:08,167

joint, take a real good shit

122
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,900
and screw your wig on tight.

123
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:13,067
And let me tell you
about the little bad

124
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,333
motherfucker called Dolemite."

125
00:06:15,367 --> 00:06:17,667
Eat out more often, I made it.

126
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,433
I carried it to the
record distributors.

127
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:23,300
The man's in charge
of distribution

128
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:27,467
said "Rudy"... says "What
on Earth you expect

129
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,067
to do with this piece of shit?"

130
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,267
I said "Sell it."

131
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,067
"He slapped his pappy's face
and said "from now on

132
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:36,433
cocksucker, I'm
runnin' this place."

133
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,900
At the age of 1...

134
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,900
he was drinkin' whiskey and gin.

135
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:47,067
At the age of 2, he was eatin'
the bottles it came in."

136
00:06:47,767 --> 00:06:51,267
And, I put records in my car.

137
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,700
Driven across country
and passed them out

138
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:57,700
in the ghetto areas of many

139
00:06:57,733 --> 00:07:02,733
of the major cities. Handin
'em to street lovin' people.

140
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:05,733
And in Philadelphia when I
passed this record out

141
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:09,133
two days later, I
had a smash hit.

142
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:10,933
By word of mouth.

143
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:13,967
"But his dick was still hard.

144
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:16,900
The preacher said "ashes

145
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:18,300
to ashes."

146
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:22,100
The company that picked it
up was Kent Records.

147
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:25,100
When I was carryin' it over to
another record company, they'd
wanna give me

148
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:26,900
you know, money,
they'd wanna give me

149
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:29,467
thousand dollars.
Well I'd already got

150
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,067
a $2700 order of the record.

151
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:34,500
And I said "I can't do
nothin' with a thousand
dollars" to the man.

152
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:36,600
Says "Rudy come back over
here with that record."

153
00:07:36,633 --> 00:07:39,600
And uh, they distributed
me across country.

154
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:42,600
After that I recorded
the second album.

155
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:45,067
Called "This Pussy
Belong to Me".

156
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:47,367
Featured the signifying monkey.

157
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,967
It hit the billboards,
best selling charts,

158
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:52,267
within two weeks after
it was released.

159
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,300
Dolemite albums are...

160
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:57,767
somethin' that a...

161
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,233
we as black men grow
up listenin' to.

162
00:08:00,267 --> 00:08:02,300
I have your albums from

163
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,667
my mother- I used to steal my
mother's Rudy Ray Moore albums.

164
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,667
I can say after hearing that I
knew what pussy was.

165
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,400
I knew what it looked like. I
never seen it, but he

166
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:12,400
described it so well.

167
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:16,367
"So drop your drawers and
get your legs open wide

168
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,300
'Cuz I'm gonna knock
open your pussy and put

169
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,600
this load deep down inside."

170
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:25,967
I am the world's first
comedian to come out

171
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:29,867
doing X rated words

172
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,400
on a record.

173
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:33,600
Rudy's humor
might've been on the

174
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:36,600
on the on the risky side. He
had some fly album covers.

175
00:08:36,633 --> 00:08:39,600
You'd se these records, and
there'd be a whole bunch of
buck naked

some crazy stuff.

00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,067
I wanted to be as
shocking as I could be.

179
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:50,500
The language was
already shocking.

180
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:54,567
But the album covers
were so erotic.

181
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,533
And the people, some
people would buy it

182
00:08:57,567 --> 00:09:00,167
yearly for the album cover.

183
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,067
"Gave $100 bills

184
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:05,067
just to see this
little girl a-play.

185
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:07,900
She was the best
whore on any block.

186
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:10,167
She went from city to city,

187
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,100
fuckin' the mayors
and senators, the

188
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:14,700

government lot.

190
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,900
Rudy was the bad boy
of the whole thing.

191
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,933
And Rudy name mean.

192
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:27,133
Uh, Queen Bee is the shit.

193
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,433
Dom't mess with Queen Bee.

194
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:32,300
Queen Bee is my name,
and fuckin' is my game.

195
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,800
I know the game from A-Z

196
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,433
'cuz ain't nothin' a
motherfucker can pull on me.

197
00:09:37,467 --> 00:09:40,433
Lady Reed was a lady
that I picked up

198
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:44,700
to try to make a comedian
and [INAUDIBLE] out of.

199
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:46,767
She made it...

200
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,733
awhile with me and went on the
road and traveled with me

201
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:51,067
here as my costar.

202
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,267

the floor the queen.

The queen of the party

204
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,533
A big hand for the
fabulous Lady Reed."

205
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,200
"Like I said, yous with
you got to give

207
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:07,267
Sell it.

208
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,300
If it's bad pussy, sell it.

209
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:13,200
If it's fat pussy, skinny pussy

210
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:15,467
sell it.

211
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,667
If it's young pussy, sell it.

212
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,633
If it's old pussy, give it a
shot of jack-rabbit

214
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:25,367
And sell that old motherfucker."

215
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,367
She quit before [INAUDIBLE]
she's passed

216
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,433
about three years ago.

217
00:10:30,467 --> 00:10:34,167
But I got to take it off to
Lady Reed, she was

218
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,167
a very dear friend of
mine. And wrote

219
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,800
several things for me
including one great one.

220
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,100
"My day have arrived."

221
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:46,100
"Now the course has changed.

222
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:49,133
And I'm pretty much on my way.

223
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:53,633
The time has arrived.

224
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:57,233
And it's my God-damned day."

225
00:10:58,433 --> 00:11:01,267
It was in the
context of his life

226
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,067
As an artists trugglin', you
know, a black man

227
00:11:04,067 --> 00:11:06,800
strugglin' tryin' to make it.
And then tryin' to do somethin'

228
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,633
for his people.

229
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,867
But I, I just felt that he
wasn't appreciated

230
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,967
eh, uh, enough.

231
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:14,867
That's why I wrote my,
that inspiration song.

232
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,767
My, uh, "My Day Arrived".

233
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,733

235
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:27,267
So while I'm climbin'
this mountain...

00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:30,567

237
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,300
have no fear.

238
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:38,833
I'm gonna remember all
when I needed someone who
stood by that was near."

239
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:41,500
I will say that we toured

240
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:44,933
we lived in hotels that were not

241
00:11:44,967 --> 00:11:47,900
what you call Triple A hotels.

242
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:50,900
But she said "Rudy," says
"I don't mind stayin'

243
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:52,600
wherever you put me.

244
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:55,600
I have a son that I'm tryin'
to send to college.

245
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:58,067
And I need to save money."

246
00:11:58,067 --> 00:12:01,100
So, we worked many
places where I

247
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:02,200
promoted the show.

248
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:04,267
[Upbeat Music]

249
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,067
See at that time,
"Streaking" was out.

250
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,167
And Rudy got this red van
sellin' he was gonna streak.

251
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,867
And I just get in the car and
said "Oh Lord help him."

252
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,867
And he, well he would just
come straight on out
streaking in the towel

253
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,300
and flash it.

254
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:20,300
But first a woman said
"drop yer drawers".

255
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,067
I'm lookin' at ladies

256
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:24,633
"Drop yer drawers."

257
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:27,333
So Rudy decide to take the towel

258
00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:29,500
and oh, everybody wanted to see.

259
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:31,900
Now I'm tryin' to get the
women on my side

260
00:12:31,933 --> 00:12:34,500
and they watchin' where,
wah, where Rudy dick was.

261
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:36,633
How long it was or what it was.

262
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:40,067
Woman snatched the towel, he
had to run out there naked
with all his black ass out.

263
00:12:40,067 --> 00:12:42,200
I'm tellin' you, they was fun.

264
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:44,567
She would go on before me

265
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,533
and do her act. And then I'd
sit in the booth and take

266
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:50,533
the money. And when she's
gettin' ready to come off

267
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:53,533
I would run back to the
stage and she would run

268
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:55,067
back to the booth.

269
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:57,167
I remember one time we in
the [INAUDIBLE] Texas

270
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
and I had so much money

271
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:02,433
all in my drawers,
all in my bra...

272
00:13:02,467 --> 00:13:05,567
and I, I couldn't give
noth- Rudy nothin' at
the, at the place.

273
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,200
I say "wait 'til you get home."

274
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:10,567
And I, I would unhook that
bra and money just fall
out everywhere.

275
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,133
So, we had good times
out there. You know,

276
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:16,767
knowing that we could
make it on our own.

277

278
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,900

279
00:13:22,933 --> 00:13:26,067
I'm gonna get my
kicks thinkin' about

280
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:29,067

00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,733
"I hope this is a hit."

283
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:37,733
One of my uh,
favorite memories of

284
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:41,067
Rudy Ray Moore and myself

285
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:43,600
when we worked at the
York Club here in

286
00:13:43,633 --> 00:13:45,267
Los Angeles.

287
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,700
The club owner, Bob,

288
00:13:47,733 --> 00:13:49,767
he fired Rudy.

289
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,667
And I say "well, if
Rudy go, I go."

290
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,533
So me and Rudy walked
out and we shook hands.

I, that wasn't where I
wanted to end up at.

297
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:16,733
And I was never got
on a screen if I

298
00:14:16,767 --> 00:14:19,133
had a waited for somebody
to put me on it.

299
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:21,367
So the way I got on
the screen was to put

300
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,667
myself on it.

"Breathin' down yo neck!"

I put the little money
that I had together

304
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,067
and made the motion
picture "Dolemite" and

makin' so much money, he
didn't close the show.

And stepped out the Cadillac,
our feet didn't even touch the

glowing inside. The people

00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:30,700
I walked up and down the streets

366

and cracked jokes to the
people that stood in line.

00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,833
There was a man that
wrote an article on me

And uh, I did. And I've always

00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,600
I've always appreciated
Rudy Ray Moore, mainly

384
00:18:25,633 --> 00:18:28,100
because he really was an
independent film maker.

385
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:32,633
The picture only run
$90,000 to make.

386
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:35,333
It played against
films that costed

belongs in that, you

of the mainstream.

Dolemite got a powerful name.

00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:58,567
- Powerful name.
- That's that's like dynamite.

1998, Dolemite after 25 years

Rudy Ray Moore has
his own, uh, humor.

00:19:20,633 --> 00:19:23,067
His own brand of, uh, comedy.

406
00:19:23,067 --> 00:19:26,067
I think he makes fun of
the situation in our

the black experience.

just to show us how we are.

00:35:26,067 --> 00:35:28,333
"What kind of shit is this?"

699
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:31,167
So he's been tagging along

700
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,933
with on all, all of those years,

701
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:38,433
"Jimmy Lynch and Marie Love,
I wanna thank y'all so much

702
00:35:38,467 --> 00:35:40,067
for coming out to be
with me tonight."

703
00:35:40,067 --> 00:35:43,067
"Dolemite, brother, we wouldn't
have missed it for the world."

704
00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:44,633
Dolemite was a rapper.

705
00:35:44,667 --> 00:35:47,667
Long before they
called it rapping.

706
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,967
When we'd get off of work
at the [inaudible] at 2
o'clock in the morning

707
00:35:54,067 --> 00:35:56,800
Rudy would be, uh, rappin'
down there on Central

708
00:35:56,833 --> 00:35:59,067
Avenue at Dolphin's
of Hollywood.

709
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,733
And everybody be crowdin'
around the window, lookin' at

710
00:36:01,767 --> 00:36:03,767
him do the radio rabbit.

711
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,367
So he the king of the raps, he

712
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,100
he put the "R" in "rap".

713
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:10,100
When I recorded such tales
as a signifying monkey

714
00:36:10,133 --> 00:36:13,100
shinin' the great
Titanic and Dolemite

715
00:36:13,133 --> 00:36:16,433
it had that uh,
rappin' flavor to it.

716
00:36:16,467 --> 00:36:18,967
And it had the
explissive language

717
00:36:19,067 --> 00:36:20,967
which a lot of people
want to refer to it as

718
00:36:21,067 --> 00:36:22,633
four letter words, but I call it

719
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:25,133
"Gheto Expressions",
and a form of art.

720
00:36:25,167 --> 00:36:26,500
I know for me

721
00:36:26,533 --> 00:36:29,800
you've always inspired
me, but in terms of that
young generation

722
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:31,433
you know, vibin' into
Rudy Ray Moore.

723
00:36:31,467 --> 00:36:33,933
Well, the things that I
were doing were sort of

724
00:36:33,967 --> 00:36:35,867
now and fresh for them.

725
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,867
In other words, I did
the Signifying Monkey

726
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,867
and it was set to
rap music, during

727
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,100
that period.

728
00:36:43,133 --> 00:36:45,700
"Signifying Monkey" I remember
really being struck by that.

729
00:36:45,733 --> 00:36:47,700
Because it was, it
was so African

730
00:36:47,733 --> 00:36:49,300
you know, it was like
"listen to this!"

731
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:50,967
We used to listen to his uh,

732
00:36:51,067 --> 00:36:52,700
his records and everything, like

733
00:36:52,733 --> 00:36:54,800
"Way down in the jungle deep"...

734
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:58,167
"The lion stepped on the
signifying monkey's feet.

735
00:37:00,733 --> 00:37:04,200
The monkey said "motherfucker,
can't you see?"

736
00:37:04,233 --> 00:37:07,067
You done stepped on
my goddamned feet!

737
00:37:07,067 --> 00:37:10,067
"The monkey lived in the
jungle in an old oak tree.

738
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:14,967
Bullshittin' the lion
every day in the week."

739
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:16,833
The lion said "I ain't
heard a word you said.

740
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:19,833
Say two more and I'll go upside
your motherfuckin' head."

741
00:37:19,867 --> 00:37:22,967
"Everyday before the
sun go down, that lion
would kick his ass.

742
00:37:23,067 --> 00:37:25,933
All through the jungle top."

743
00:37:25,967 --> 00:37:28,067
The monkey said "that's
alright, 'cuz you gonna meet up

744
00:37:28,067 --> 00:37:30,933
with a bad motherfucker
later on in life."

745
00:37:30,967 --> 00:37:34,133
"And he's somebody
that you don't know."

746
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:38,500
"He just broke a-loose from
Ringling Brother's show."

747
00:37:38,533 --> 00:37:41,433
"Said he talked about your
people in a hell of a way."

748
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:44,633
I talked about your uncle 'til
the motherfucker hair turn gray.

749
00:37:44,667 --> 00:37:47,633
I screwed your mother,
your aunt and your niece.

750
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:50,267
Even had a [inaudible]
your grandma for a piece.

751
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,800
The signifying monkey is
probably the strongest tale

752
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:56,333
that I tell in person.

753
00:37:56,367 --> 00:37:59,600
Plush shine in the great
Titanic and Old Folk Hotel.

754
00:37:59,633 --> 00:38:01,667
They've been around
'round 50 years.

755
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,300
As I say, told by the beer joint

756
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:06,633
and liquor store wise men.

757
00:38:06,667 --> 00:38:11,833
"Wasn't it sad when the
great Titanic went down?

758
00:38:11,867 --> 00:38:14,267
There was people of all races

759
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,633
of all different kind.

760
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:23,267
But there was one black
motherfucker on the deck that
they called Shine.

761
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,833
He wore sweet and
wild britches and

762
00:38:25,867 --> 00:38:28,467
broken shoes.

763
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,767
You know that
motherfucker used ta

764
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,333
sit around all day just
a singin' the blues."

765
00:38:34,367 --> 00:38:35,833
He's the...

766
00:38:35,867 --> 00:38:37,733
ice cube of the

767
00:38:37,767 --> 00:38:40,267
[Laughing] of the...

768
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,867
70's. He's Ice T.

769
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,867
When I first started rappin' and
swearin' and cursin' on records

770
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,700
people were like they acted
like I made it up.

771
00:38:48,733 --> 00:38:51,767
We like "naw, naw, there's
other brothers that were

772
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,767
far in the future before
me that made it up."

773
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,767
I'm just tryin' to
carry on the tradition.

774
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,767
Beastie Boys, long time,
Rudy Ray Moore

775
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,433
Dolemite fans. Pretty
much we became

776
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:05,767
completely Dolemite
influenced and inspired.

777
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,800
I mean he been doin' this
shit for years, right?

778
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,567
And I like I been
studyin' his little

779
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,833
style, i could take his
whole style and just
flip the whole shit.

780
00:39:14,867 --> 00:39:17,433
Dolemite is just, definite,
he's was in one our videos.

781
00:39:17,467 --> 00:39:18,433
Called "In The Ghetto".

782
00:39:18,467 --> 00:39:20,500
"Why you jive turkeys,
I'll knock you through

783
00:39:20,533 --> 00:39:22,300
Sunday and be waitin'
for you on Monday.

784
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:26,933
You too young to seen the
sights that [inaudible] and
[inaudible] about Dolemite."

785
00:39:26,967 --> 00:39:30,067
Uh, you have to know the
fly-fucker, the pussy-maker

786
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:31,133
the big-bitch-breaker.

787
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:33,267
Well alright, it's
Dolemite. The Legend.

788
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,500
You motherfuckers better know.

789
00:39:34,533 --> 00:39:37,567
Man, I seen him as
just at the Godfather

790
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,200
you know I'm sayin'? Still out
here kickin' it in 2000.

791
00:39:41,233 --> 00:39:45,733
Keepin' it real, just like
in '73, '74 all that you
know I'm sayin'?

792
00:39:45,767 --> 00:39:50,067
Just like that man. That
nigger's just a livin'
legend man, bottom line.

793
00:39:50,067 --> 00:39:52,867
The rappers, they've
picked parts

794
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,933
from my party records and
dubbed them into their rap.

795
00:39:56,967 --> 00:39:58,733
Dr. Dre,

796
00:39:58,767 --> 00:40:00,600
the Chronic Album,

797
00:40:00,633 --> 00:40:03,267
Big Daddy Kane, the
Taste of Chocolate,

798
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,300
The 2-Live Crew, many albums.

799
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:08,700
31 times they sample me.

800
00:40:08,733 --> 00:40:12,333
I've been sampled now 80
times off my records.

801
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:15,300
All that just stuck in my
head trippin' on how much he

802
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:17,533
influenced everythang
and just how

803
00:40:17,567 --> 00:40:19,533
his recreation keep
comin' around.

804
00:40:19,567 --> 00:40:22,767
You, we can't get away from
him 'cuz that's our roots.

805
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,600
Uh, Busta Rhyme

806
00:40:24,633 --> 00:40:27,700
he had me in an album called

807
00:40:27,733 --> 00:40:30,367
"When Disaster Strikes".

808
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,833
A great album.

809
00:40:31,867 --> 00:40:34,600
The late great Eazy-E

810
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:37,467
was my very dear friend. Any
time he give something

811
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,200
he wanted Dolemite there.

812
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:40,767
You did a song with Dolemite

813
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,300
As I call "Merry
Motherfucking Christmas".

814
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:44,567
It was kinda cool.

815
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,900
And another one of the great
rappers was Too Short.

816
00:40:47,933 --> 00:40:51,400
Too Short invited me out
one night he said "I
want you to come out

817
00:40:51,433 --> 00:40:54,000
and introduce me on my
final performance."

818
00:40:54,033 --> 00:40:56,267
He called himself retirin',
but he didn't retire.

819
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,267
I worked with Dr. Dre.

820
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,600
Dr. Dre had me in the
Snoop Dogg video

821
00:41:01,633 --> 00:41:04,833
"He shoulda came alone today.

822
00:41:04,867 --> 00:41:06,733
He's Snoop Doggy Dog."

823
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:08,433
Without Rudy Ray Moore

824
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:11,133
wouldn't be no Snoop Dog.
And that's real.

825
00:41:11,167 --> 00:41:14,400
I appear on his album before
his last one called

826
00:41:14,433 --> 00:41:16,600
"Top Dogg No Limit".

827
00:41:16,633 --> 00:41:18,400
I think the young man

828
00:41:18,433 --> 00:41:20,800
no doubt about it is one of the

829
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:23,800
truly great rappers of our time.

830
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:26,167
We just sittin' here live,
you know, percolating.

831
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,500
With the man, the
myth, the legend

832
00:41:28,533 --> 00:41:30,167
my uncle Rudy Ray Moore.

833
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,167
Also my nephew Nate Dogg.

834
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,967
And we doin' his DPG.

835
00:41:34,067 --> 00:41:37,467
Rudy Ray Moore thang, you
know, givin' a special
shout out, a tribute

836
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,267
to the greatest of all time.

837
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,933
Like I said, without him there
wouldn't be no rap community.

838
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:44,433
He was doin' it before we knew
what to do with it.

839
00:41:44,467 --> 00:41:46,533
And we gon' continue
to push his rim

840
00:41:46,567 --> 00:41:49,133
and keep it goin' on and
take it to the next level.

841
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:51,100
And let the young
generation know

842
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:54,067
what he means to this industry
and what he means to this

843
00:41:54,067 --> 00:41:56,067
you know community
that we call rap.

844
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,933
And how we should cherish
every moment that we spend

845
00:41:58,967 --> 00:42:01,167
with the great Rudy Ray Moore.

846
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,167
[Cheering]

847
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:07,200
[Music PLaying]

848
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:18,900
I can remember
talkin' about Rudy.

849
00:42:18,933 --> 00:42:21,700
I said "Rudy could
adjust to any crowd."

850
00:42:21,733 --> 00:42:24,667
Uh, meaning that if
a crowd wanted uh

851
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,200
triple X material...

852
00:42:27,233 --> 00:42:29,667
then rudy could give it
to 'em triple X. And

853
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,067
in fact he probably had extra
couple more X's in there.

854
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,700
I first got introduced to Rudy
Ray Moore, actually

855
00:42:36,733 --> 00:42:38,833
through uh, Richard Pryor.

856
00:42:38,867 --> 00:42:41,633
Richard Pryor is a fan of his.
Richard likes his work.

857
00:42:41,667 --> 00:42:43,733
I think that, uh, Rudy gave

858
00:42:43,767 --> 00:42:45,100
Eddie Murphy and

859
00:42:45,133 --> 00:42:49,333
a lot of those
comedians, uh, yeah...

860
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:51,200
I think he give them courage.

861
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:54,833
Eddie Murphy has Rudy
Ray Moore parties.

862
00:42:54,867 --> 00:42:58,367
We stay up all night watching
all of Rudy's films.

863
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,300
And Eddie is insane
for Rudy Ray Moore.

864
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:03,533
What makes him so funny?

865
00:43:03,567 --> 00:43:05,967
His, he's just a
comedian, he's funny.

866
00:43:06,067 --> 00:43:07,400
