1
00:00:17,275 --> 00:00:22,813
# I head east towards the city #

2
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:25,215
# And when the sun goes down #

3
00:00:25,216 --> 00:00:28,085
# I'm heading home again #

4
00:00:31,723 --> 00:00:37,193
# The city lights
have left me empty #

5
00:00:37,194 --> 00:00:39,694
# They've replaced the stars #

6
00:00:39,696 --> 00:00:42,697
# That used to shine so bright #

7
00:00:44,467 --> 00:00:48,336
# But I will smile #

8
00:00:48,338 --> 00:00:53,208
# And I'll keep you close #

9
00:01:00,882 --> 00:01:02,716
# And when the sun breaks #

10
00:01:02,718 --> 00:01:05,552
# In the morning... #

11
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,401
It's a fanfare.

12
00:01:13,403 --> 00:01:16,103
It's great... arrival music.

13
00:01:16,105 --> 00:01:19,573
It's "Fanfare for a Son"... a classic.

14
00:01:31,853 --> 00:01:35,255
Dad, I caved on the shirt.
I'm not wearing the tie.

15
00:01:35,257 --> 00:01:36,991
A young man in a tie
makes a statement.

16
00:01:36,993 --> 00:01:39,627
What, that my father dresses me
in the morning?

17
00:01:40,663 --> 00:01:43,198
Nobody wears ties
to these things.

18
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:48,234
What?

19
00:01:48,236 --> 00:01:51,304
Without the tie,
we're having the sex talk.

20
00:01:52,573 --> 00:01:55,475
Oh, my God.

21
00:02:00,447 --> 00:02:03,216
I need a six-letter
word for llama.

22
00:02:03,218 --> 00:02:04,984
Llama?
Yeah.

23
00:02:04,986 --> 00:02:07,053
Vicuña

24
00:02:07,055 --> 00:02:09,222
How could you possibly
know that?

25
00:02:09,224 --> 00:02:10,389
Give me another one.

26
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:12,991
Okay, um, feckless.

27
00:02:12,993 --> 00:02:14,594
What's another word
for feckless?

28
00:02:14,596 --> 00:02:16,928
Feckless?
Yeah.

29
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,332
Honey, feckless
is the other word.

30
00:02:19,334 --> 00:02:21,733
Come on, it's nine letters.

31
00:02:27,907 --> 00:02:33,945
# It's getting cold
out on that big lake #

32
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:39,883
# And the water's painted blue #

33
00:02:39,886 --> 00:02:45,222
# Don't let the skyline
fool you, baby... #

34
00:02:45,224 --> 00:02:47,658
Mom.
Yeah?

35
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,294
You just missed the turn.
No, I didn't.

36
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:51,363
You looked right
at the sign that said

37
00:02:51,365 --> 00:02:53,464
"Middleton Campus
Not This Way. "

38
00:02:53,466 --> 00:02:54,865
I don't know
what you're talking about.

39
00:02:54,867 --> 00:02:57,901
What is wrong with you?
You're gonna make me late.

40
00:03:01,872 --> 00:03:03,673
It's pointless!

41
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:06,576
What's pointless?

42
00:03:06,578 --> 00:03:10,479
The goddamn nine-letter word
for feckless.

43
00:03:11,915 --> 00:03:13,417
Pointless.

44
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,086
Right?

45
00:03:17,088 --> 00:03:19,422
Look, Conrad,
I know that Middleton

46
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,524
is not at the top
of your list,

47
00:03:21,526 --> 00:03:23,059
but just give it a chance.

48
00:03:23,061 --> 00:03:25,328
Sometimes a place
can surprise you.

49
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,763
I'm surprised no one's
wearing a tie.

50
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,203
Can't you just park head in,
like most

51
00:03:35,204 --> 00:03:38,139
every other driver
on the planet?

52
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:40,107
Father: I've told you before,
you have much better visibility

53
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:41,810
when you're exiting
a parking space...

54
00:03:41,812 --> 00:03:43,545
Dad, you just got parked.

55
00:03:51,286 --> 00:03:53,554
Hi. Excuse me.

56
00:03:53,556 --> 00:03:55,622
Excuse me.

57
00:03:55,624 --> 00:03:57,257
Excuse me.
Hi. Good morning.

58
00:03:57,259 --> 00:03:58,426
Hi.
Good morning.

59
00:03:58,428 --> 00:04:01,129
Uh, you took my spot.

60
00:04:01,131 --> 00:04:02,530
I thought you were
pulling into that one.

61
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:05,233
No, I was gonna back... you know,
I was going to go like...

62
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:06,967
and then come in and back
into this one like that.

63
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:09,404
Ah, you're one of those.

64
00:04:09,406 --> 00:04:11,939
What does that mean?
Look, it's a parking lot.

65
00:04:11,941 --> 00:04:14,808
There's a space.
Celebrate.

66
00:04:18,446 --> 00:04:19,879
Celebrate?

67
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:21,313
<i>Of course a guy
who wears a bow tie</i>

68
00:04:21,316 --> 00:04:23,183
would back into
a parking space.

69
00:04:23,185 --> 00:04:26,318
Mom, just let it go.

70
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:27,921
Celebrate.

71
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,191
I bet you he irons
his underwear.

72
00:04:32,193 --> 00:04:35,961
I bet you he waits 30 minutes
after eating before swimming.

73
00:04:35,963 --> 00:04:37,196
You know fuming
is feckless, right?

74
00:04:37,198 --> 00:04:40,466
Yeah, and I bet you he made
his boy wear that tie.

75
00:04:40,468 --> 00:04:41,867
Oh, my God, let's go!

76
00:04:41,869 --> 00:04:44,336
Of course she drives an X5
with 40-inch wheels

77
00:04:44,338 --> 00:04:46,337
because we all know
how treacherous

78
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:48,172
these paved roads can be.

79
00:04:48,175 --> 00:04:50,074
She had Colorado plates.

80
00:04:50,076 --> 00:04:52,945
Yeah, well, God save
the grizzlies.

81
00:04:52,947 --> 00:04:54,812
All right, hey, everybody.

82
00:04:54,814 --> 00:04:56,914
Gather round.
Here we go.

83
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:59,617
Hope everybody had
a good drive in, 10:00 tour.

84
00:04:59,619 --> 00:05:02,253
<i>Okay, welcome to
Meet Middleton!</i>

85
00:05:02,255 --> 00:05:04,889
First, let's meet Justin. Hi.

86
00:05:04,891 --> 00:05:06,791
That's me. I'm Justin.
Great to meet you guys.

87
00:05:06,793 --> 00:05:10,294
<i>Hi, Justin. I'll be taking you
around today.</i>

88
00:05:10,297 --> 00:05:12,163
Let's just pass
these bad boys out...

89
00:05:12,165 --> 00:05:14,565
a little brochure, a map of the campus,
know where we're going.

90
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:16,000
Thank you.
Okay, cool.

91
00:05:16,002 --> 00:05:19,070
A couple things about me...
I'm a junior at the college

92
00:05:19,072 --> 00:05:21,972
and a double major
in music and horticulture...

93
00:05:21,974 --> 00:05:24,708
unfortunately known
as a dingleberry.

94
00:05:27,246 --> 00:05:29,211
Thank you.

95
00:05:29,213 --> 00:05:31,448
Um, we're gonna take
a two-hour tour,

96
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:33,682
after which we'll
break for lunch.

97
00:05:33,684 --> 00:05:37,522
And then we're gonna have
a pretty exciting thing.

98
00:05:37,523 --> 00:05:39,389
You're gonna meet
the faculty member

99
00:05:39,391 --> 00:05:41,491
from the department
of your choice.

100
00:05:41,493 --> 00:05:44,227
<i>And by the time the
afternoon bell sounds...</i>

101
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:51,501
you'll have fallen in love.

102
00:05:51,502 --> 00:05:53,136
I guarantee it.

103
00:05:53,137 --> 00:05:55,005
Well, all right, so let's get this
little tour bus on the road,

104
00:05:55,007 --> 00:05:56,106
you rock stars.

105
00:05:56,108 --> 00:05:58,374
Come on!
Let's get going.

106
00:05:58,376 --> 00:06:01,009
They have a planetarium.
It's an observatory.

107
00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:03,611
It's an observatory, chief.

108
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,879
<i>A fun fact about the walkway
we're currently on...</i>

109
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:07,682
<i>it was built by a thousand
children in 1842.</i>

110
00:06:07,684 --> 00:06:10,084
What a waste of a perfectly
beautiful tie.

111
00:06:10,086 --> 00:06:12,520
<i>Tell me about it. I'm just kidding.
Just 100...</i>

112
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:15,156
<i>Lovely day.
Let's go over here.</i>

113
00:06:15,158 --> 00:06:17,959
Come on in. Come on in.
Don't be shy.

114
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,527
It's just me.

115
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:22,029
Now, the college,
which is situated on

116
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:25,334
just over 100
breathtaking acres,

117
00:06:25,336 --> 00:06:28,971
was founded in 1887
by Lowndes Pope Middleton,

118
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:32,706
<i>who as a young man made
a fortune in whale blubber</i>

119
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,607
<i>before finding
his true calling</i>

120
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,944
in education and philanthropy.

121
00:06:36,946 --> 00:06:39,112
Now, his bronze likeness

122
00:06:39,114 --> 00:06:41,815
once stood upon this pedestal,

123
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:44,818
but fell prey to some bandits

124
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,719
in the late 1960s.

125
00:06:46,722 --> 00:06:48,555
Why didn't they replace him?

126
00:06:48,557 --> 00:06:51,691
<i>Well, you know, these boots
have sort of become</i>

127
00:06:51,693 --> 00:06:54,928
a living metaphor for the
mission of Middleton.

128
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,963
Have you had any deaths
on campus?

129
00:06:56,965 --> 00:06:58,965
You'd be surprised.
There are a lot of deaths.

130
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:00,566
I'm just kidding.
There's... no.

131
00:07:00,568 --> 00:07:02,568
<i>Very, very safe here.</i>

132
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,071
<i>We have a security team of students.
They're volunteers.</i>

133
00:07:05,073 --> 00:07:08,406
They're constantly patrolling.
We give them small nightsticks.

134
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:10,775
And they make sure everybody
sort of stays in order.

135
00:07:10,777 --> 00:07:12,245
It's a good system.

136
00:07:12,247 --> 00:07:15,248
I see the toe of the boot
is fairly worn out.

137
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,316
Is that a tradition...
to rub the toes there?

138
00:07:17,318 --> 00:07:19,785
<i>It is. It is. Thank you
for bringing that up.</i>

139
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:24,056
Before an important day
or test or something,

140
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:26,058
you're supposed
to kiss the boot.

141
00:07:26,059 --> 00:07:28,093
<i>Any rapes?
Oh, my God.</i>

142
00:07:28,095 --> 00:07:31,162
<i>A lot of rapes. But that's typical
at college, you know.</i>

143
00:07:31,164 --> 00:07:34,231
<i>That's what you're
getting into.</i>

144
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:37,234
Yeah. So it's a
fantastic tradition.

145
00:07:37,236 --> 00:07:40,105
I need a coffee.
You had two cups in the car.

146
00:07:40,107 --> 00:07:42,173
Do you want one?
Can I get you one? No.

147
00:07:42,175 --> 00:07:44,407
Cool. Any more questions?
Love questions.

148
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:46,277
They're not even gonna
notice I'm gone, okay?

149
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,477
<i>Excuse me.
Our next stop on the tour</i>

150
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:50,648
is gonna be the Pope Library.

151
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:52,348
<i>Now this thing is
brand-spanking-new,</i>

152
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,883
<i>so you're gonna be pretty
impressed.</i>

153
00:07:53,885 --> 00:07:55,952
Okay? Just remember,
don't smudge the glass.

154
00:07:55,954 --> 00:07:58,021
It's the hospital.
I'll see you in the library.

155
00:07:58,023 --> 00:08:00,224
All right. And wipe those
boots before entering.

156
00:08:00,226 --> 00:08:01,558
<i>Come on, you rascals.</i>

157
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:02,559
<i>We're having fun.
We're having fun.</i>

158
00:08:02,562 --> 00:08:04,128
<i>Say it.</i>

159
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,630
Hello. Yes.
Dr. Hartman.

160
00:08:07,632 --> 00:08:08,831
Yes. Hello?

161
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,633
Yes, Dr. Ha... hello?
Hello?

162
00:08:12,871 --> 00:08:14,505
Unbelievable.

163
00:08:14,507 --> 00:08:17,041
One of those, please.

164
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,075
Make it two.

165
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,949
I hear they keep
the doctor away.

166
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,621
<i>I talked... doctor...</i>

167
00:08:32,623 --> 00:08:36,925
<i>but... when...
George, are you...</i>

168
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:39,995
<i>The connection... George?</i>

169
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:42,731
<i>George?
Hey.</i>

170
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:44,465
<i>George, are you the...?</i>

171
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:47,134
<i>Can't hear... you there?</i>

172
00:08:47,136 --> 00:08:49,871
<i>George, I'm dying.
Help me.</i>

173
00:08:49,873 --> 00:08:51,373
Larry, are you there? Larry.

174
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,508
<i>George, you still there?
Yeah, I got you.</i>

175
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,676
<i>George?
Listen, Larry,</i>

176
00:08:54,678 --> 00:08:56,176
there's nothing
to worry about, okay?

177
00:08:56,178 --> 00:08:57,778
You're in good hands.
I need you to relax.

178
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,782
Call me anytime, all right?
Larry? Larry?

179
00:09:05,488 --> 00:09:08,254
These things are so feckless,
don't you think?

180
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,124
Excuse me?

181
00:09:10,126 --> 00:09:11,959
These tours.

182
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,696
Feckless?
Mm-hmm.

183
00:09:16,698 --> 00:09:19,199
Let me guess... you're a high school
English teacher.

184
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:21,735
Wrong. How about you?

185
00:09:21,737 --> 00:09:24,070
Wait, let me guess.
Let me guess.

186
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,773
Are you a Brooks
Brothers model?

187
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,177
I'm a cardiac surgeon.
I was speaking with a patient.

188
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:35,580
Mm, so you can fix a heart
over the phone?

189
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,250
Depends on the data plan.

190
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,621
Well, is he gonna make it?

191
00:09:46,026 --> 00:09:47,793
I'm not sure.

192
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:51,296
Oh.

193
00:09:51,298 --> 00:09:53,065
George Hartman.

194
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:54,600
Oh.

195
00:09:54,602 --> 00:09:56,235
What?

196
00:09:56,237 --> 00:09:58,536
Heart man?
Oh, yes.

197
00:09:58,538 --> 00:10:00,872
Well, what can I say?
I like things neat.

198
00:10:00,874 --> 00:10:02,907
I'm Edith Martin.

199
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:04,442
Edith?
Oh.

200
00:10:04,444 --> 00:10:06,511
Oh, I know, I know,

201
00:10:06,513 --> 00:10:07,945
but it's gonna
make a comeback.

202
00:10:07,946 --> 00:10:09,379
Just wait and see.

203
00:10:09,381 --> 00:10:10,714
Excuse me.

204
00:10:10,716 --> 00:10:15,018
Do you know where
the Pope Library is?

205
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,154
Yeah.

206
00:10:17,156 --> 00:10:19,488
It's the building next
to the building

207
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:22,124
behind that building.

208
00:10:22,126 --> 00:10:23,659
So next to the thing?

209
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:25,430
Exactly.

210
00:10:27,465 --> 00:10:31,069
43 grand a year and that's
the best they can do?

211
00:10:35,074 --> 00:10:38,775
You made your boy
put on that tie, didn't you?

212
00:10:38,777 --> 00:10:40,310
You mean the waste of a tie.

213
00:10:40,312 --> 00:10:42,745
Well, it's obvious
he doesn't want to wear it.

214
00:10:42,747 --> 00:10:45,381
I was just trying
to be encouraging.

215
00:10:46,683 --> 00:10:49,218
Well, your girl seemed
very determined.

216
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,986
Audrey. Yeah, I named her
after Audrey Hepburn,

217
00:10:51,988 --> 00:10:53,688
but it was a serious
miscalculation.

218
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:54,924
I should have named
her Benito.

219
00:10:54,926 --> 00:10:56,958
A smartphone fascist?
Right?

220
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,294
Oh, my God.

221
00:10:58,296 --> 00:11:00,061
If Audrey had to give up
either her phone

222
00:11:00,063 --> 00:11:04,065
or a kidney, she'd be on dialysis,
I'm sure of it.

223
00:11:04,067 --> 00:11:06,468
So is Middleton
your first stop?

224
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,904
No, it's our only stop.

225
00:11:09,906 --> 00:11:14,243
Yeah, I couldn't get her
to look anyplace else.

226
00:11:14,245 --> 00:11:18,247
My husband was supposed
to chaperone, but...

227
00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:20,982
he couldn't get off of work.

228
00:11:22,718 --> 00:11:24,918
I told my wife that...

229
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,454
I wouldn't miss this
for the world.

230
00:11:27,456 --> 00:11:29,957
I think it's a little
slice of heaven.

231
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:31,725
Middleton?

232
00:11:31,727 --> 00:11:34,895
Yes, Middleton.

233
00:11:34,897 --> 00:11:39,299
Eh, a little small
for my taste.

234
00:11:39,301 --> 00:11:40,967
We all like books here
a lot at Middleton.

235
00:11:40,969 --> 00:11:42,503
We're big fans of books.

236
00:11:42,504 --> 00:11:43,837
Our library, the Pope Library,

237
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:49,408
<i>has on hand over 200,000
volumes of books</i>

238
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,345
<i>as well as a huge collection
of rare books.</i>

239
00:11:52,347 --> 00:11:55,347
It's not small.
It's intimate is what it is.

240
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:58,984
God, these things are like
a dog and pony show.

241
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:01,420
They give your child
no idea whatsoever

242
00:12:01,422 --> 00:12:03,756
what it would be like
to actually go here.

243
00:12:03,758 --> 00:12:05,525
It's just a day.

244
00:12:05,527 --> 00:12:07,727
<i>Books are like the magazines
of the gods. Am I right?</i>

245
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:11,364
Sometimes a day
can be an eternity.

246
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:13,266
Particularly if you're
in the company of a man

247
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:16,401
who backs into
a parking space.

248
00:12:16,404 --> 00:12:17,503
It's a good place
to come and study.

249
00:12:17,505 --> 00:12:19,204
There's actually
a floor upstairs

250
00:12:19,206 --> 00:12:21,106
that you're required
to be quiet.

251
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,942
These tours are like a first date.

252
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:27,612
She's smart. She's pretty.
She smells good.

253
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,648
Maybe you'll try to stick
your hand up her shirt.

254
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,048
Shh!

255
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,516
<i>My favorite is "Cat Fancy"
and "Dog Fancy,"</i>

256
00:12:33,518 --> 00:12:36,052
"House and Garden,"
"Botanist's Weekly,"

257
00:12:36,054 --> 00:12:38,955
"Architectural Digest"...
a whole array of stuff.

258
00:12:38,957 --> 00:12:40,790
A lot of good magazines here.

259
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:43,093
<i>I'm just always
trying to keep up.</i>

260
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,663
<i>Now, this is pretty exciting...</i>

261
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:48,099
currently we have on loan
from the British Library

262
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:52,169
a manuscript from renowned poet
and author Charles Dodgson.

263
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:55,639
Now, Dodgson didn't write
under his real name.

264
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,675
Lewis Carroll.

265
00:12:57,677 --> 00:12:59,710
Very good. Very nice.

266
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:02,680
Um, Carroll's masterwork

267
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:04,914
"Alice's Adventures
in Wonderland"...

268
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,417
that's gonna be here till
the end of the month,

269
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,518
so we're very excited.

270
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,520
Excuse me.

271
00:13:10,522 --> 00:13:12,454
I find it extraordinary

272
00:13:12,456 --> 00:13:14,923
that Lewis Carroll's masterwork
would be available

273
00:13:14,925 --> 00:13:17,259
to such a small college.

274
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:19,461
<i>I think it's incredible.
I do.</i>

275
00:13:19,463 --> 00:13:22,297
But, you know, a lot of really
cool stuff happens here.

276
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:24,966
Um, this past weekend

277
00:13:24,969 --> 00:13:28,270
Snatches of Pink played
a free concert on the quad.

278
00:13:28,272 --> 00:13:31,306
<i>Ah Justin.
Hmm?</i>

279
00:13:31,307 --> 00:13:33,608
On a scale of one to 10,

280
00:13:33,611 --> 00:13:37,180
could you rate the effect
on your life respectively

281
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:39,749
of the visiting manuscript

282
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,583
versus the Snatches
of Pink concert?

283
00:13:43,952 --> 00:13:45,287
The Snatches were tight.

284
00:13:46,724 --> 00:13:48,756
The Snatches
were tight, George.

285
00:13:48,758 --> 00:13:51,058
So let's...
Tight.

286
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,160
Hey, let's float on over
to this residence hall.

287
00:13:53,162 --> 00:13:55,763
Ooh, speaking of floating...
I know what that means.

288
00:13:55,765 --> 00:13:57,498
Just up the stairs

289
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,034
<i>and, ironically,
it's just past the Ps.</i>

290
00:14:02,238 --> 00:14:04,038
<i>All righty, so come on.</i>

291
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,774
This dorm we're gonna go see...
it's actually named after

292
00:14:06,776 --> 00:14:09,976
the fourth of Middleton's
seven illegitimate children.

293
00:14:09,978 --> 00:14:12,413
Osborne.
You're killing it.

294
00:14:12,415 --> 00:14:14,447
You're on fire.

295
00:14:14,449 --> 00:14:16,917
She's the one to beat, you guys.
Uh-oh.

296
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:19,218
Seven children
from seven women...

297
00:14:19,219 --> 00:14:21,052
<i>hey, Middleton
was no Moby Dick.</i>

298
00:14:21,055 --> 00:14:22,854
<i>Hey.
Hey.</i>

299
00:14:22,856 --> 00:14:25,258
<i>I am on fire right now.
This woman's driving me crazy...</i>

300
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,393
completely loony.

301
00:14:27,395 --> 00:14:29,128
You look very handsome.

302
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,430
A little pinch in there
and we'll be all set.

303
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:33,399
What do you think of it so far?

304
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:35,735
Of what?
Middleton.

305
00:14:35,737 --> 00:14:38,671
It's small.

306
00:14:38,673 --> 00:14:40,739
It's not small.
It's intimate.

307
00:14:40,741 --> 00:14:42,275
Why are you cramming
this place down my throat?

308
00:14:42,276 --> 00:14:43,375
Who's cramming?

309
00:14:43,377 --> 00:14:45,377
Can't you just let me
figure it out myself?

310
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:46,812
How are you gonna
figure it out

311
00:14:46,813 --> 00:14:48,647
with this kind
of feckless approach?

312
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:50,915
Feckless?
Feckless.

313
00:14:50,918 --> 00:14:52,584
That would be
"not tight" to you.

314
00:14:52,586 --> 00:14:55,586
Dad, please don't
say "tight. "

315
00:14:56,888 --> 00:14:58,622
Where are you going?

316
00:14:58,624 --> 00:15:01,693
I'm going to figure
it out myself.

317
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:58,413
I think he's rounding second.

318
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,883
Hey. How are you?

319
00:16:00,885 --> 00:16:02,753
You think they're freshmen?

320
00:16:02,755 --> 00:16:04,153
Yeah.

321
00:16:07,556 --> 00:16:09,958
Carry on. Carry on.

322
00:16:14,163 --> 00:16:16,531
You know,
it's not polite to stare.

323
00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:19,133
I'm not staring.
Oh, you were a statue.

324
00:16:19,135 --> 00:16:22,604
How long were you there? Just
long enough to catch you staring.

325
00:16:23,938 --> 00:16:25,939
What are you doing up here?
Going to the bathroom.

326
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:28,443
Is that your story? Because my
money's on you followed me.

327
00:16:28,444 --> 00:16:31,211
I did no such thing.
Of course you did.

328
00:16:31,213 --> 00:16:32,579
Yeah, I could easily say
that you came up here

329
00:16:32,581 --> 00:16:33,814
so I would follow you.

330
00:16:33,816 --> 00:16:37,250
You could.
And you'd be wrong.

331
00:16:37,252 --> 00:16:41,120
Excuse me. Hey.
I'm trying to write a paper here.

332
00:16:41,122 --> 00:16:42,421
You know, this is a library.

333
00:16:42,423 --> 00:16:43,389
I'm sorry.
We're being rude.

334
00:16:43,391 --> 00:16:45,690
What paper are you working on?

335
00:16:45,692 --> 00:16:49,095
You wouldn't be interested.
Give it a shot. I might surprise you.

336
00:16:49,098 --> 00:16:52,566
What have you got there?
Hemingway? Steinbeck?

337
00:16:52,568 --> 00:16:55,669
That's cute.
"Images of Sexual Alienation

338
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,471
As They Relate
to the Monkey Garden

339
00:16:58,474 --> 00:17:01,140
in 'The House on Mango Street. '

340
00:17:01,142 --> 00:17:03,543
I got nothing for you.
Good luck.

341
00:17:03,545 --> 00:17:06,012
What, you guys get separated
from the tour?

342
00:17:06,013 --> 00:17:07,013
Yeah.

343
00:17:07,014 --> 00:17:10,382
Dingleberry?
Yeah.

344
00:17:10,384 --> 00:17:11,717
You're better off on your own.

345
00:17:20,492 --> 00:17:22,026
Thank you.

346
00:17:22,028 --> 00:17:24,261
Okay, I did follow you.

347
00:17:24,263 --> 00:17:26,263
Ha! Why?

348
00:17:26,265 --> 00:17:28,232
I wanted to apologize.
For what?

349
00:17:28,234 --> 00:17:30,334
For being that guy.
Oh.

350
00:17:30,335 --> 00:17:33,370
Oh, pshh.
You're not really that guy.

351
00:17:33,372 --> 00:17:35,705
I mean, your son thinks
you're that guy.

352
00:17:35,707 --> 00:17:37,776
But trust me,
you're definitely not that guy.

353
00:17:37,777 --> 00:17:40,545
Monkey Garden back there
will grow up to be that guy.

354
00:17:40,547 --> 00:17:42,848
Anyway, apology accepted.

355
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,882
Thank you.

356
00:17:49,321 --> 00:17:52,989
Where do you suppose
they are?

357
00:17:52,991 --> 00:17:55,024
Well...

358
00:17:55,026 --> 00:17:59,028
uh, library.

359
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,097
According to the schedule,
Osborne Hall.

360
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:03,298
Yeah?

361
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:06,201
Is Osborne Hall...
Is where?

362
00:18:06,203 --> 00:18:08,404
...around here?

363
00:18:08,406 --> 00:18:11,241
Oh, it's in the building

364
00:18:11,243 --> 00:18:12,808
next to the building
behind that building.

365
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:16,345
Osborne Hall,
which is where I'm going.

366
00:18:16,347 --> 00:18:18,480
Okay, let me guess...

367
00:18:18,482 --> 00:18:21,250
you sell...

368
00:18:21,252 --> 00:18:23,853
antiques.

369
00:18:23,855 --> 00:18:25,588
Hmm.

370
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,156
Gardening equipment.
Mm.

371
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:30,492
Antique gardening equipment.

372
00:18:30,494 --> 00:18:32,995
Children's furniture.
Really?

373
00:18:32,997 --> 00:18:34,962
High-end children's furniture.

374
00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:37,698
And what constitutes high-end
children's furniture?

375
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,901
It being in my store.

376
00:18:39,904 --> 00:18:41,602
How about you?

377
00:18:41,604 --> 00:18:44,373
So you fix broken hearts.
Do you have any other children?

378
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,040
No. You?

379
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,242
No, Audrey's
all we can handle.

380
00:18:48,244 --> 00:18:50,578
I thought they would be here.

381
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,915
Yeah.

382
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:56,117
Hello?

383
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:58,486
<i>Up in this building...
Hi. Where are you?</i>

384
00:18:58,488 --> 00:18:59,819
Where are you?
I thought you said

385
00:18:59,821 --> 00:19:00,720
we were gonna do
this together.

386
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:01,956
Well, yeah,
that's what I thought,

387
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,223
until it became obvious

388
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,792
I've become some endless
well of embarrassment for you.

389
00:19:05,794 --> 00:19:07,626
You know how important
this day is to me.

390
00:19:07,628 --> 00:19:08,994
Why are you doing this?

391
00:19:08,996 --> 00:19:10,663
I don't know. I don't know
what you're talking about.

392
00:19:10,665 --> 00:19:13,501
"How many people
have been killed at Middleton?"

393
00:19:13,503 --> 00:19:14,834
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

394
00:19:14,836 --> 00:19:17,470
You're indicting me
for being a caring parent?

395
00:19:17,472 --> 00:19:19,872
No, I'm indicting the succubus
that body-snatched your soul

396
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,642
and is walking around
in your clothes today.

397
00:19:22,644 --> 00:19:24,377
She just called me a succubus.

398
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:26,479
<i>Succubus?
Listen to me, Audrey.</i>

399
00:19:26,481 --> 00:19:28,815
<i>Okay...
No, Mom, you listen.</i>

400
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:31,017
This is the beginning of
my Middleton experience.

401
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:33,453
<i>And I'm not gonna
let you ruin it.</i>

402
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:35,854
I'm going here.
I'm gonna study with Emerson.

403
00:19:35,856 --> 00:19:39,057
And you know what else?
I'm gonna finish.

404
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:40,358
Okay, what does that mean?

405
00:19:40,361 --> 00:19:41,893
It means that I won't
have to settle

406
00:19:41,895 --> 00:19:43,995
for selling furniture
the rest of my life.

407
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,238
Ooh!

408
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,507
I can't.
I can't. No.

409
00:19:57,776 --> 00:19:59,911
Oh, God.

410
00:19:59,913 --> 00:20:02,848
Okay, you know what?

411
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,017
I'd say that you're
behaving like

412
00:20:06,019 --> 00:20:10,088
a five-letter word
that means "female dog. "

413
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,090
Okay.

414
00:20:13,425 --> 00:20:15,826
So, listen, when I was
in the library,

415
00:20:15,828 --> 00:20:17,960
I happened to run
into the dean of students

416
00:20:17,963 --> 00:20:19,830
who just volunteered
to give George and me

417
00:20:19,832 --> 00:20:22,566
a personal tour of the campus.
What?

418
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:25,269
<i>Dean Pruitt?
Yeah, in the flesh.</i>

419
00:20:25,271 --> 00:20:29,972
But what we're seeing
isn't on the regular tour, no.

420
00:20:29,974 --> 00:20:33,943
You get to meet Middleton.
We get to feel her up.

421
00:20:33,945 --> 00:20:36,379
<i>Really?
Really.</i>

422
00:20:36,381 --> 00:20:39,715
<i>So take your personal space.</i>

423
00:20:39,716 --> 00:20:42,183
Enjoy the cookie-cutter tour
with the Dingleberry.

424
00:20:42,186 --> 00:20:45,987
And, you know, call me
when you need a ride home.

425
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:50,760
That was very impressive.
What?

426
00:20:50,762 --> 00:20:53,296
The way you so convincingly
lied to your daughter.

427
00:20:53,298 --> 00:20:57,033
Yeah? I'm not even warmed up.

428
00:20:57,035 --> 00:20:59,067
<i>Okay, guys,
I can't help it.</i>

429
00:20:59,069 --> 00:21:01,169
<i>At this point,
I've just got to tell you</i>

430
00:21:01,171 --> 00:21:05,273
<i>some really great things
about Middleton...</i>

431
00:21:05,275 --> 00:21:07,275
Hi.
Oh, hey. What's going on?

432
00:21:07,277 --> 00:21:10,512
Audrey Martin.
Hi. Conrad Hartman.

433
00:21:10,514 --> 00:21:12,614
Parking lot earlier.

434
00:21:12,616 --> 00:21:14,816
Yeah, I remember.
Yeah. Yeah.

435
00:21:14,818 --> 00:21:17,384
Nice to meet you.
You as well.

436
00:21:17,386 --> 00:21:19,354
So where is your mom?

437
00:21:19,356 --> 00:21:21,823
Um, who cares?

438
00:21:21,824 --> 00:21:23,023
What do you mean?

439
00:21:23,025 --> 00:21:25,894
She seems pretty cool,
for a mom.

440
00:21:25,896 --> 00:21:28,594
Why didn't your mom
make the trip?

441
00:21:28,596 --> 00:21:31,130
You know,
this is Dad's thing.

442
00:21:31,132 --> 00:21:33,232
And Dad's thing's
really Mom's thing.

443
00:21:33,234 --> 00:21:36,470
I guess he wanted it to be
some kind of bonding experience,

444
00:21:36,472 --> 00:21:39,039
but I'm totally
not feeling it.

445
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:43,543
It just seems
all so feckless.

446
00:21:43,546 --> 00:21:45,279
You said "feckless. "

447
00:21:45,281 --> 00:21:47,748
Yeah, feckless.

448
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,449
Yeah.

449
00:21:51,552 --> 00:21:54,921
You know, maybe
Monkey Garden is right.

450
00:21:54,924 --> 00:21:57,990
Maybe we'd do better
on our own.

451
00:21:57,992 --> 00:22:00,059
Are you advocating tour hooky?

452
00:22:00,061 --> 00:22:03,027
Yep.
What do I tell Conrad?

453
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:07,031
Oh, you know, I don't know.
Just give him some space.

454
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:10,268
You know?
Let him loosen his tie.

455
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,036
But this visit
was my idea.

456
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:13,571
He's gonna think
I flaked out on him.

457
00:22:13,573 --> 00:22:15,440
He doesn't even have
lunch money.

458
00:22:23,249 --> 00:22:25,183
I don't think so.

459
00:22:25,185 --> 00:22:27,319
You know, they're
probably in class.

460
00:22:27,321 --> 00:22:28,420
Look, we'll bring
them right back.

461
00:22:28,422 --> 00:22:30,789
No.
This is fate.

462
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:34,292
This is theft, Edith.

463
00:22:34,294 --> 00:22:36,561
When was the last time
you rode a bike, George?

464
00:22:38,363 --> 00:22:40,197
Yeah, my point exactly.

465
00:22:40,199 --> 00:22:41,499
Now get on.

466
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,134
According to the Dingleberry,

467
00:22:43,135 --> 00:22:46,403
we have a little over 100 breathtaking
acres at our disposal.

468
00:22:46,405 --> 00:22:48,037
You know?
We need the speed.

469
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:51,674
Come on.
We'll bring 'em right back.

470
00:22:51,676 --> 00:22:53,810
Come on, Hartman!

471
00:22:53,812 --> 00:22:56,212
Get the stick out of your ass!

472
00:22:56,214 --> 00:22:59,215
Hey.

473
00:22:59,217 --> 00:23:00,950
All right.

474
00:23:10,827 --> 00:23:13,229
12.
What?

475
00:23:13,232 --> 00:23:16,532
Last time I rode a bike,
I was 12.

476
00:23:30,947 --> 00:23:31,947
Are you sure
you're okay, George?

477
00:23:31,949 --> 00:23:34,817
You strike me as a helmet-wearing
kind of guy.

478
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:38,854
Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

479
00:23:41,691 --> 00:23:44,026
I think I lost a testicle.

480
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:23,463
Oh.

481
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,151
Wow!

482
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:54,726
Oh...

483
00:24:54,728 --> 00:24:57,796
You okay?

484
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:01,098
Yeah. Just give me
a second.

485
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,633
Unbelievable.

486
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:04,935
Look, you can see
the entire campus.

487
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:07,138
You can see the town.
Yeah. Yeah.

488
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,573
You can see the one car
parked backwards.

489
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:12,009
Yeah. Yeah.

490
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:16,847
Get over here.
Yeah. Yeah.

491
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:22,920
Yeah.

492
00:25:22,922 --> 00:25:25,221
Did you read up ever
on this bell tower?

493
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:26,823
Hmm? No.

494
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,958
Yeah, there's a legend
of the bell tower.

495
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,761
I saw it here in the...

496
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:33,529
oh, here it is.

497
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,831
Edith, Edith, don't do that.

498
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:38,367
Don't lean over like that.

499
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:41,337
Says here the tower
was completed in 1917,

500
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:44,607
the year that the United States
entered the First World War.

501
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:46,876
More than 150
Middleton students

502
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,412
enlisted for military service.
Hmm.

503
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:52,814
And there was a young
woman by the name of...

504
00:25:52,816 --> 00:25:55,585
a freshman,
name of Matilda Reynolds,

505
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:58,920
whose boyfriend,
Seymour Sternshine,

506
00:25:58,922 --> 00:26:01,623
was among the newly minted
doughboys.

507
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:05,227
Upon his departure, she ascended
the steps of this very tower

508
00:26:05,228 --> 00:26:08,597
and stood in the east window,

509
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:12,199
facing Europe,
of course, yeah,

510
00:26:12,201 --> 00:26:15,469
where she silently pledged
her eternal love to him,

511
00:26:15,471 --> 00:26:17,937
vowing that she would rise
into the tower

512
00:26:17,939 --> 00:26:22,009
at the same time each day until
he returned safely from the war.

513
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,612
Aww.
Young love.

514
00:26:24,615 --> 00:26:27,881
And what happened?

515
00:26:27,883 --> 00:26:30,317
What happened?

516
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:33,687
It says... oh.

517
00:26:33,689 --> 00:26:36,256
Seymour was killed.

518
00:26:38,793 --> 00:26:39,626
Yeah, he was killed by...

519
00:26:39,628 --> 00:26:42,429
by a stampede of rogue swine
in the Loire Valley

520
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:46,400
that also claimed the lives
of almost all of his platoon

521
00:26:46,402 --> 00:26:51,169
except for his young brother,
Ernest Sternshine,

522
00:26:51,171 --> 00:26:54,539
who was the bugle man
who lived to tell the story.

523
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:57,876
Apparently
the high C notes

524
00:26:57,878 --> 00:27:01,279
drove off the rogue swine...

525
00:27:01,281 --> 00:27:03,882
the very sensitive ears
that their swine have.

526
00:27:06,253 --> 00:27:08,753
Seymour Sternshine.

527
00:27:08,755 --> 00:27:10,522
All right,
so I have a little trouble

528
00:27:10,524 --> 00:27:14,292
playing poker
in a brightly lit room.

529
00:27:14,294 --> 00:27:15,761
Come over here.

530
00:27:15,763 --> 00:27:17,797
Come over here.
You can't miss this.

531
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:18,631
No, I'm good.
There's a nice breeze here.

532
00:27:18,633 --> 00:27:19,665
Huh?

533
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:21,333
A nice breeze here.
Come here.

534
00:27:29,575 --> 00:27:31,242
No.
Yes.

535
00:27:31,244 --> 00:27:33,611
Yeah?
Yeah.

536
00:27:33,612 --> 00:27:36,079
You're afraid of heights?
"Afraid" is a strong word.

537
00:27:36,081 --> 00:27:39,883
Let's just say I try to organize
my life in such a way

538
00:27:39,885 --> 00:27:42,586
where heights don't really
play into the equation.

539
00:27:42,588 --> 00:27:44,755
So you will open up
a person's chest

540
00:27:44,757 --> 00:27:45,989
with a very sharp knife,

541
00:27:45,991 --> 00:27:50,226
but you won't stand over here
by this railing?

542
00:27:50,228 --> 00:27:51,728
It's a little more
complicated than that,

543
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:52,762
but pretty much, yeah.

544
00:27:52,764 --> 00:27:55,664
No. Come on.
I will... I'll help you.

545
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:57,333
No, listen...
I'll help you.

546
00:27:57,335 --> 00:28:00,403
I will take care of you. I promise.
I'll take care of you.

547
00:28:00,405 --> 00:28:01,837
Edith.
Come on.

548
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:03,305
Edith, I can't go over there.
You can.

549
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:04,641
No, I can't.
I'll help you.

550
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:06,108
No, I can't go over there.
Yes, you can.

551
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,676
Listen to me very carefully.
I'll help you.

552
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,278
Edith. Edith. Come on.
Come on, George.

553
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,914
I can't go over there.
Yes, you can.

554
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:12,915
Come on.

555
00:28:14,684 --> 00:28:16,619
Come on.

556
00:28:17,921 --> 00:28:21,524
You can't miss this.

557
00:28:21,525 --> 00:28:23,058
Okay, I saw a bird.

558
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,394
I saw a bird.

559
00:28:27,696 --> 00:28:29,665
Edith.

560
00:28:48,117 --> 00:28:49,484
Ahh.

561
00:28:49,486 --> 00:28:51,352
Mm. Thank you.

562
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,788
Open your eyes.
Oh.

563
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,790
Open your eyes.

564
00:28:57,024 --> 00:28:58,391
Open your eyes.

565
00:28:58,394 --> 00:29:00,995
Oh, my God.
Open your eyes.

566
00:29:00,996 --> 00:29:03,431
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

567
00:29:03,433 --> 00:29:05,700
Oh, my God.

568
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,668
I am starting to get
Middleton as intimate.

569
00:29:09,973 --> 00:29:11,270
Oh! No. Really?

570
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,273
So this is the church

571
00:29:14,275 --> 00:29:17,042
of Santos Dominicus
Ignatius Aloysius

572
00:29:17,044 --> 00:29:20,913
and my favorite thing about
this place is the reverberation.

573
00:29:20,915 --> 00:29:23,482
Sometimes I just come
in here and I sing.

574
00:29:23,484 --> 00:29:25,517
# Amen. #

575
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:26,885
You know?

576
00:29:26,887 --> 00:29:28,987
# Jesus. #
Stuff like that.

577
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:33,258
So I'm not a religious person,
but I find it very powerful,

578
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,360
so I come here on the tours.

579
00:29:35,363 --> 00:29:37,062
Just halfway through.

580
00:29:37,064 --> 00:29:39,765
We can just take a break
and, yeah, have a seat.

581
00:29:39,767 --> 00:29:44,170
If... if, you know,
you feel like prayer, pray.

582
00:29:44,172 --> 00:29:47,138
<i>And if you feel just like
cooling off, taking a break,</i>

583
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,006
<i>it's fine to do that.</i>

584
00:29:49,008 --> 00:29:51,642
<i>Just take a deep breath.</i>

585
00:29:51,644 --> 00:29:56,480
# Hallelujah. #

586
00:30:03,056 --> 00:30:05,522
It's so small.

587
00:30:07,593 --> 00:30:10,227
Compared to what?

588
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,328
On the virtual tour,
it seemed bigger.

589
00:30:17,168 --> 00:30:19,670
Well, there's
always Princeton.

590
00:30:19,671 --> 00:30:22,538
And what does that mean?

591
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,275
It just doesn't seem that
you like this place very much.

592
00:30:25,277 --> 00:30:27,377
Well, that's because
I love this place.

593
00:30:27,379 --> 00:30:28,778
Why?

594
00:30:30,714 --> 00:30:32,782
Roland Emerson.

595
00:30:32,784 --> 00:30:35,751
I hear he only works
with upperclassmen.

596
00:30:35,753 --> 00:30:38,354
What?
That's bullshit.

597
00:30:38,356 --> 00:30:39,755
Sit back, please.

598
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:46,329
He's one of the premier linguistic
scholars in the country.

599
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:47,496
And?

600
00:30:47,498 --> 00:30:50,399
And linguistics is the perfect
foundation for any number of careers.

601
00:30:50,401 --> 00:30:53,735
Like?
Like law, business.

602
00:30:55,905 --> 00:30:58,372
So what are you gonna study?

603
00:30:58,374 --> 00:31:01,642
I'm just keeping
my options open.

604
00:31:01,644 --> 00:31:03,110
Hmm.

605
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:06,412
Yeah, yeah, that's a really
strong department.

606
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:12,721
I'm just saying.

607
00:31:12,723 --> 00:31:14,289
Whew.

608
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,824
How come this...

609
00:31:15,826 --> 00:31:18,125
they put a bench
in front of a tree?

610
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:21,028
It blocks the view.

611
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:23,265
Well...
What was here first?

612
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:26,767
The tree was here first,
judging by the girth.

613
00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:30,204
See that boy over there?
Mm-hmm.

614
00:31:30,206 --> 00:31:32,840
Ronald.

615
00:31:32,842 --> 00:31:35,842
He is from Battle Creek,
Michigan. Mm-hmm.

616
00:31:35,844 --> 00:31:38,176
<i>He will try, but fail
to discover the cure</i>

617
00:31:38,178 --> 00:31:39,779
<i>for restless leg syndrome.</i>

618
00:31:47,086 --> 00:31:49,055
That one over there.

619
00:31:49,056 --> 00:31:52,457
<i>Oh, that's either
Adonis or Samson, right?</i>

620
00:31:52,459 --> 00:31:53,992
<i>One of the two.</i>

621
00:31:53,994 --> 00:31:57,296
He majors in geology and...

622
00:31:57,298 --> 00:31:58,797
see how he's looking up?

623
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,600
Astronomy.
Uh-huh.

624
00:32:00,602 --> 00:32:02,802
Which makes him, of course,
a rock star.

625
00:32:02,804 --> 00:32:04,370
Oh.

626
00:32:06,707 --> 00:32:08,608
Oh.

627
00:32:10,142 --> 00:32:15,513
And of course he'll forego
the sciences to write a...

628
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,782
very successful
novel entitled

629
00:32:17,784 --> 00:32:19,718
"My Life As a Spirochete. "

630
00:32:21,486 --> 00:32:23,688
You know what that is?

631
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:25,790
Any relation
to a parakeet?

632
00:32:25,792 --> 00:32:30,194
Well, it's a parakeet that spied
in the Spanish-American War.

633
00:32:33,432 --> 00:32:34,699
My turn.

634
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,999
Give me one.

635
00:32:39,137 --> 00:32:41,505
The young girl there.

636
00:32:41,507 --> 00:32:44,942
Ah, that is Tessa.

637
00:32:44,944 --> 00:32:48,645
<i>Tessa has just learned
from her parents</i>

638
00:32:48,647 --> 00:32:52,449
that her Rhodesian Ridgeback
named Hedwig has croaked.

639
00:32:52,451 --> 00:32:54,617
He's...

640
00:32:54,619 --> 00:32:56,886
he's movedon. org.

641
00:32:56,888 --> 00:32:59,121
And she's just trying

642
00:32:59,123 --> 00:33:02,425
to consolidate her grief
into, like, 40 characters

643
00:33:02,427 --> 00:33:05,061
so that she could tweet
her sadness to the world.

644
00:33:05,063 --> 00:33:06,896
Yeah, and she will.

645
00:33:10,934 --> 00:33:14,236
How about that guy?

646
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:16,005
With the suit?
Yep.

647
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:18,240
That's Georgie.
Mm-hmm.

648
00:33:18,242 --> 00:33:20,476
Georgie is enormously bright,

649
00:33:20,478 --> 00:33:24,178
but is hampered
by the little brother complex.

650
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,548
He always wants to make
his father proud.

651
00:33:29,284 --> 00:33:32,986
He will marry the first woman
he falls in love with.

652
00:33:32,988 --> 00:33:36,125
And he will go on to a long
and distinguished, but...

653
00:33:38,427 --> 00:33:41,829
somewhat unfulfilling
career as a surgeon.

654
00:33:43,933 --> 00:33:46,267
I detect a sadness in Georgie.

655
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:50,738
No, it's not sadness.
He has enormous resolve.

656
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,540
Can I tell you something
about Georgie?

657
00:33:52,542 --> 00:33:55,009
No.

658
00:33:55,011 --> 00:33:58,045
I think that...

659
00:33:58,047 --> 00:34:01,947
that he has no idea just
how special he truly is.

660
00:34:05,185 --> 00:34:08,687
But, you know, that's probably
the Dasani talking.

661
00:34:11,124 --> 00:34:13,527
Have some more Dasani.

662
00:34:15,495 --> 00:34:17,930
Come on. Come.

663
00:34:17,932 --> 00:34:20,366
Get the bikes back?
Yeah.

664
00:34:23,335 --> 00:34:24,970
Thank you.

665
00:34:33,979 --> 00:34:35,513
Hi. What's your major?

666
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:39,684
Good-bye.

667
00:34:42,388 --> 00:34:44,422
Come on.

668
00:34:57,202 --> 00:34:59,170
Georgie.

669
00:35:01,272 --> 00:35:04,308
"The Appassionata. "

670
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,176
You play?

671
00:35:06,178 --> 00:35:09,245
I play at it. You?

672
00:35:09,247 --> 00:35:10,713
A prodigy.

673
00:35:10,715 --> 00:35:13,149
Prodigy?

674
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:15,185
Remember, I've seen you lie.

675
00:35:15,187 --> 00:35:17,855
I'm gonna need
some confirmation.

676
00:35:24,762 --> 00:35:27,263
Stay.

677
00:35:32,637 --> 00:35:35,304
Oh.

678
00:35:35,306 --> 00:35:37,240
After you.

679
00:35:39,008 --> 00:35:41,978
Age before beauty.

680
00:36:10,706 --> 00:36:12,873
Prodigy.

681
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:05,090
<i>Okay!</i>

682
00:37:05,092 --> 00:37:08,393
I'm trying to learn the
Rachmaninoff's Second, okay?

683
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:11,830
And "Chopsticks" playing
in the background...

684
00:37:11,832 --> 00:37:14,932
it makes it feel like
you are mocking me.

685
00:37:15,902 --> 00:37:17,369
Okay?

686
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,839
Yeah.

687
00:37:21,841 --> 00:37:23,542
Whew. Yeah.

688
00:37:23,544 --> 00:37:25,544
Rachmaninoff is so hard.

689
00:37:25,545 --> 00:37:28,512
The guy must have had hands
the size of trash can lids.

690
00:37:28,514 --> 00:37:30,514
I know.

691
00:37:30,516 --> 00:37:33,049
If I stretch any further,
I feel like

692
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:36,487
bones will poke
out of my fingertips.

693
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:55,205
Yeah, these are Bach's hands.

694
00:37:55,207 --> 00:37:58,407
You know?
Stay away from the Russians.

695
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:00,110
You know, enjoy them.
Admire their passion.

696
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:03,679
But, like, don't get obsessed
with playing them.

697
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,950
No one's ever said that to me.

698
00:38:08,952 --> 00:38:10,852
Thank you.

699
00:38:10,854 --> 00:38:12,754
You're a lucky man.

700
00:38:12,756 --> 00:38:14,289
Thank you.

701
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,426
<i>Edith. Edith. Edith.</i>

702
00:38:18,428 --> 00:38:20,495
Okay, let's go.
Let go. Okay, boy.

703
00:38:20,497 --> 00:38:22,196
Okay, time to practice.
Let's go.

704
00:38:22,198 --> 00:38:23,298
Okay, let go.
Let go.

705
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,333
Thank you.
Good luck.

706
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:26,001
Come on. Come on.
This way.

707
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:27,636
Campus police is outside
looking for the bicycles.

708
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,903
Let's go.
But we borrowed them.

709
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:31,006
No, no, no, I'd rather not
have that discussion.

710
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:32,241
Come on.

711
00:38:33,743 --> 00:38:36,211
Wasn't that nice?
Oh, nice, very good. Nice kid.

712
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:38,913
Oh. Come on.
No, George, I mean the duet.

713
00:38:38,915 --> 00:38:40,949
What? It feels good to
have a partner.

714
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:44,151
I think we should walk faster, Edith.
Are you happy, George?

715
00:38:44,153 --> 00:38:47,921
Happy? I'd be a lot happier
if we don't end up in the pokey.

716
00:38:47,923 --> 00:38:50,057
Pokey?

717
00:38:54,095 --> 00:38:55,829
Oh! Oh!

718
00:38:55,831 --> 00:38:57,863
Come.
Come here, come here.

719
00:39:03,338 --> 00:39:05,371
Come on,
George, this way.

720
00:39:05,373 --> 00:39:06,739
Edith, I can't go up. Edith.

721
00:39:06,741 --> 00:39:09,343
Come on. Yes, you can.
Come on.

722
00:39:10,944 --> 00:39:15,248
Negative. No sign of them.
Don't look down. Look up.

723
00:39:42,976 --> 00:39:45,476
<i>Now don't get chilly.</i>

724
00:39:45,479 --> 00:39:47,579
<i>Gotta get up and warm up.</i>

725
00:39:47,581 --> 00:39:51,349
<i>Good. Let's go, the last time.
Big-time. Go.</i>

726
00:39:53,386 --> 00:39:56,219
<i>Very good. Puh-puh-puh,
buh-buh-buh, muh-muh-muh.</i>

727
00:39:56,222 --> 00:39:59,222
<i>Puh-puh-puh, buh-buh-buh,
muh-muh-muh.</i>

728
00:39:59,224 --> 00:40:00,692
This way.

729
00:40:00,694 --> 00:40:02,559
<i>Edith. Edith.</i>

730
00:40:02,561 --> 00:40:04,862
<i>Duh-duh-duh, nuh-nuh-huh,
tuh-tuh-tuh.</i>

731
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,997
Duh-duh-duh, nuh-nuh-huh,
tuh-tuh-tuh.

732
00:40:06,999 --> 00:40:08,766
Duh-duh-duh,
nuh-nuh-huh, tuh-tuh-tuh.

733
00:40:08,768 --> 00:40:10,968
Duh-duh-duh, nuh-nuh-huh,
tuh-tuh-tuh.

734
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:14,271
<i>Duh-duh-duh, nuh-nuh-huh,
tuh-tuh-tuh. Good. Br-r-r-r.</i>

735
00:40:14,273 --> 00:40:17,408
<i>Br-r-r-r.</i>

736
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:20,277
Again.

737
00:40:22,014 --> 00:40:24,514
<i>All the way.</i>

738
00:40:25,514 --> 00:40:27,545
<i>Good. Puh-puh-puh,
buh-buh-buh, muh-muh-muh.</i>

739
00:40:28,029 --> 00:40:30,081
<i>Puh-puh-puh, buh-buh-buh,
muh-muh-muh.</i>

740
00:40:30,355 --> 00:40:32,216
<i>Puh-puh-puh, buh-buh-buh,
muh-muh-muh.</i>

741
00:40:32,484 --> 00:40:34,425
<i>Puh-puh-puh, buh-buh-buh,
muh-muh-muh.</i>

742
00:40:34,462 --> 00:40:35,658
<i>Duh-duh-duh,
nuh-nuh-huh, tuh-tuh-tuh.</i>

743
00:40:35,659 --> 00:40:37,659
<i>Duh-duh-duh, nuh-nuh-huh,
tuh-tuh-tuh.</i>

744
00:40:37,661 --> 00:40:40,095
<i>Good. Take a deep breath.
Ahh.</i>

745
00:40:40,097 --> 00:40:42,563
<i>Good. Let's go
all the way down.</i>

746
00:40:42,566 --> 00:40:45,366
Get up and take the deep breath.

747
00:40:45,368 --> 00:40:49,204
It helps you to relax.

748
00:40:49,206 --> 00:40:52,307
And exhale in one tone.

749
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:54,476
<i>Ahh.</i>

750
00:40:54,478 --> 00:40:55,911
<i>Beautiful.</i>

751
00:40:55,913 --> 00:40:58,480
<i>Let's stretch.
All the way.</i>

752
00:40:58,482 --> 00:41:00,816
<i>And let me see you move</i>

753
00:41:00,818 --> 00:41:02,651
with the sentence.

754
00:41:02,653 --> 00:41:04,886
Shh.

755
00:41:08,156 --> 00:41:10,591
<i>Beautiful.
Let's change the legs.</i>

756
00:41:10,592 --> 00:41:12,827
<i>Br-r-r-r.
Shake it up.</i>

757
00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:14,628
<i>Br-r-r-r.</i>

758
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:17,998
<i>Now let's have
the last intense sentence.</i>

759
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,202
<i>Go.</i>

760
00:41:24,705 --> 00:41:26,273
<i>Beautiful.</i>

761
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,874
<i>Let's get ready
for the scene work.</i>

762
00:41:27,876 --> 00:41:30,377
Hey.

763
00:41:30,378 --> 00:41:32,178
Can I help you?

764
00:41:38,376 --> 00:41:40,383
Hi.
Hi.

765
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:43,355
Hey, class.
Wonderful class.

766
00:41:43,357 --> 00:41:45,390
We came in the wrong door.

767
00:41:45,393 --> 00:41:48,962
There are no wrong doors.
All the world's a stage.

768
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,330
Not in my world.

769
00:41:50,332 --> 00:41:51,830
Who are you?

770
00:41:51,832 --> 00:41:53,899
We're...
We're... we're... we're...

771
00:41:53,901 --> 00:41:55,869
We're... we got lost...
We got lost from the...

772
00:41:55,871 --> 00:41:59,071
separated from the tour. Yeah.
Yeah.

773
00:41:59,073 --> 00:42:01,807
Oh, Dingleberry.

774
00:42:01,809 --> 00:42:03,642
Hey, can we watch your class
for a bit? Do you mind?

775
00:42:03,644 --> 00:42:07,512
I'm sorry, but no one
audits my class.

776
00:42:07,515 --> 00:42:09,548
I require full participation.

777
00:42:11,317 --> 00:42:13,652
I'm gonna kill you, Edith.

778
00:42:13,654 --> 00:42:15,287
Sorry, some other time.

779
00:42:15,289 --> 00:42:17,289
Thank you very much.
We'll be right down.

780
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:18,788
Edith.
George.

781
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:20,358
Let's go this way.
No, come on.

782
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,025
Edith. Edith.
George, let's go.

783
00:42:22,027 --> 00:42:24,762
Edith, George, now.

784
00:42:24,764 --> 00:42:27,031
All right, you guys,
I don't want to see any tears,

785
00:42:27,033 --> 00:42:30,968
but this concludes the
tour portion of the day.

786
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:32,169
Aww.

787
00:42:32,171 --> 00:42:34,538
I know. I hope it's been fun
and informative.

788
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:39,009
And this is the cafeteria
right here to our right.

789
00:42:39,011 --> 00:42:42,012
You know, go in there.
Don't have the chowder.

790
00:42:42,014 --> 00:42:44,215
It's pretty nasty.

791
00:42:44,217 --> 00:42:46,851
And I hope you guys can fill out
your evaluation forms.

792
00:42:46,853 --> 00:42:48,752
And enjoy the rest
of your visit.

793
00:42:48,755 --> 00:42:51,388
Oh, thanks.
Thanks. Good job.

794
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:53,756
Thank you.
Hope you give me all fives.

795
00:42:53,758 --> 00:42:55,958
Thanks.
All right.

796
00:42:57,126 --> 00:42:58,761
Excuse me.
Mm-hmm?

797
00:42:58,762 --> 00:43:00,729
I just have a few questions.

798
00:43:00,731 --> 00:43:02,798
I love questions.
Shoot 'em.

799
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,701
Is it true that Roland Emerson
won't work with underclassmen?

800
00:43:05,703 --> 00:43:07,769
I'm sorry, what is
a Roland Emerson?

801
00:43:07,771 --> 00:43:09,638
He's a person.

802
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,809
The premier linguistics
professor in the country.

803
00:43:12,811 --> 00:43:15,078
Roland Emerson.
Roland Emerson.

804
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,213
No, I'm just kidding. I know him.
He's a big hit here.

805
00:43:18,215 --> 00:43:23,285
Roland and I are like this.

806
00:43:23,287 --> 00:43:26,155
Okay, let me tell you exactly
how to peel the Emerson onion.

807
00:43:26,157 --> 00:43:27,289
So...

808
00:43:29,558 --> 00:43:31,859
How did you get
out of your shackles?

809
00:43:31,861 --> 00:43:34,596
Wait! What about the onion?

810
00:43:34,598 --> 00:43:36,463
Girlfriend stuff.

811
00:43:36,465 --> 00:43:41,302
I can't wait to fail your
evaluation.

812
00:43:41,304 --> 00:43:44,305
Dingleberry.

813
00:43:44,307 --> 00:43:46,106
So how was your day, honey?

814
00:43:46,108 --> 00:43:48,375
It was good.
What's for dinner?

815
00:43:48,377 --> 00:43:50,309
I'm leaving you,
Gerald.

816
00:43:50,312 --> 00:43:53,046
No, you're not.
What's for dinner?

817
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:55,882
There is no dinner.
I'm leaving.

818
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:58,085
And I won't be
talked out of it this time.

819
00:43:58,087 --> 00:44:00,254
<i>No, you're not. No,
you're not leaving, come on.</i>

820
00:44:00,256 --> 00:44:03,358
<i>I'm leaving.
You're just leaving?</i>

821
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,224
<i>I'm just leaving.
That's so silly.</i>

822
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:07,460
<i>What's silly about it?
I'm sorry.</i>

823
00:44:07,462 --> 00:44:09,363
I thought these two were
supposed to be married.

824
00:44:09,364 --> 00:44:10,696
That's correct.

825
00:44:10,698 --> 00:44:13,699
No married couple in the history
of marriage talks like this.

826
00:44:13,701 --> 00:44:16,202
Yeah, I can't say it was
working for me either.

827
00:44:19,106 --> 00:44:21,574
George, Edith,

828
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:24,075
<i>take the stage.
No.</i>

829
00:44:24,077 --> 00:44:25,610
Yeah
No.

830
00:44:25,612 --> 00:44:27,213
Yeah.
No, it was working fine.

831
00:44:27,215 --> 00:44:29,280
Make it real for us, please.

832
00:44:29,283 --> 00:44:31,783
No.

833
00:44:31,785 --> 00:44:33,718
No, Edith.

834
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,755
<i>Come on.
Edith.</i>

835
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:37,922
Please.

836
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:41,859
I'm going to give each of you
separately an objective

837
00:44:41,861 --> 00:44:43,227
which you will attempt
to achieve

838
00:44:43,229 --> 00:44:45,195
through an improvised dialogue.

839
00:44:45,197 --> 00:44:50,168
Yeah. Let's go.
Come on.

840
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:52,036
Easy enough?

841
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:54,072
Please have a seat.

842
00:44:54,074 --> 00:44:57,041
So, Edith, why don't you
try to get...

843
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:02,212
And, George...

844
00:45:02,214 --> 00:45:04,748
to make Edith to go
to bed with you,

845
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:06,917
into bed as soon as possible.

846
00:45:06,919 --> 00:45:10,120
No. No.
Give me another objective.

847
00:45:10,122 --> 00:45:12,122
Save it, George.
You know the rules.

848
00:45:12,124 --> 00:45:14,258
Remember, just stay
in the moment.

849
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:16,292
Connect to your partner,
and it's all good.

850
00:45:16,294 --> 00:45:18,594
No, I understand. No, really,
I need another objective.

851
00:45:18,596 --> 00:45:20,963
Give me another one.
Come on, George.

852
00:45:20,964 --> 00:45:23,699
You are a successfully
married couple.

853
00:45:23,701 --> 00:45:26,168
You know each other
from the inside out.

854
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:28,838
This should be a piece of cake.

855
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,139
Please.

856
00:45:31,141 --> 00:45:33,975
Edith is trying to get George
to bake a pie

857
00:45:33,977 --> 00:45:37,380
and George is trying
to get Edith into bed.

858
00:45:39,483 --> 00:45:43,052
Trust your instincts
and follow each other.

859
00:45:43,054 --> 00:45:47,056
Call upon your own experience
and emotion as necessary.

860
00:45:48,792 --> 00:45:50,526
Okay?

861
00:45:50,528 --> 00:45:51,926
Please.

862
00:46:14,782 --> 00:46:17,184
Are you happy, George?

863
00:46:27,795 --> 00:46:29,896
Maybe this isn't
the right time, Edith.

864
00:46:29,898 --> 00:46:32,031
No, I think it's the perfect time.

865
00:46:37,538 --> 00:46:40,874
If I was happy,
would you have to ask?

866
00:46:40,876 --> 00:46:42,574
So we're gonna be
honest today?

867
00:46:42,577 --> 00:46:47,946
I've been honest
every day of...

868
00:46:47,949 --> 00:46:50,549
of this...

869
00:46:53,353 --> 00:46:57,122
my marriage.

870
00:46:57,124 --> 00:46:59,892
I haven't.

871
00:47:04,563 --> 00:47:07,999
It's probably time
I tell the truth.

872
00:47:08,001 --> 00:47:10,066
Go ahead.

873
00:47:10,068 --> 00:47:12,538
Okay.

874
00:47:16,241 --> 00:47:19,310
I am profoundly unhappy.

875
00:47:25,517 --> 00:47:28,486
And I'm lonely.

876
00:47:28,488 --> 00:47:30,288
And lonely.

877
00:47:40,431 --> 00:47:43,799
Let it ring.

878
00:47:43,801 --> 00:47:46,302
Edith, let it ring.
You started this.

879
00:47:46,305 --> 00:47:48,405
I want to hear what you have to say.
No, you don't want to hear.

880
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:51,006
You don't want to hear anything
that isn't about you,

881
00:47:51,008 --> 00:47:54,877
your wants and your needs.

882
00:48:10,861 --> 00:48:13,395
When did you stop loving me?

883
00:48:13,397 --> 00:48:17,765
What?

884
00:48:17,767 --> 00:48:23,705
When did you stop
loving me?

885
00:48:23,707 --> 00:48:27,141
Did you ever love me?

886
00:48:35,417 --> 00:48:38,586
Did you ever love me?
It's a simple question.

887
00:48:41,957 --> 00:48:43,423
George.

888
00:48:49,932 --> 00:48:51,198
George.

889
00:48:58,706 --> 00:49:00,239
Right.

890
00:49:00,242 --> 00:49:03,377
George. George.

891
00:49:14,388 --> 00:49:17,390
I'm so sorry.

892
00:49:17,392 --> 00:49:21,761
I'm so sorry.
It's not your fault.

893
00:49:33,238 --> 00:49:34,773
Wow.

894
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,782
Thanks for having us.

895
00:49:43,784 --> 00:49:47,085
Carry on.

896
00:49:55,962 --> 00:50:00,764
Mm, I should probably
call him back.

897
00:50:00,766 --> 00:50:03,232
Oh, yeah.

898
00:50:03,234 --> 00:50:06,736
Okay, sure.
Ahem.

899
00:50:08,973 --> 00:50:13,743
Hi. Sorry I missed your call.
We were in a thing.

900
00:50:13,745 --> 00:50:18,281
Yeah. Oh, it's great.
It's a little slice of heaven.

901
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:22,184
Mm-hmm.

902
00:50:22,187 --> 00:50:23,785
Oh, she loves it, yeah.

903
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:26,789
I can tell it's gonna be work
getting her back in the car.

904
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:28,891
Did you talk to her yet?
Did you...?

905
00:50:28,893 --> 00:50:32,895
Oh, it's beautiful. It's a
beautiful campus, you know.

906
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:41,436
Well, how are you? Yeah?

907
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:44,639
Uh...
Try texting her.

908
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:46,975
Hi. Yeah.

909
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:49,844
What?
Yeah, mm-hmm.

910
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:52,380
Just checking in before you left.

911
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:53,681
We'll see what she says.

912
00:50:53,684 --> 00:50:54,849
She hasn't met him yet,
but I'm sure...

913
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:56,985
No, everything...
everything's fine.

914
00:50:56,987 --> 00:51:02,157
Conrad is passionately indifferent
towards Middleton.

915
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:03,991
<i>No big surprise.</i>

916
00:51:03,993 --> 00:51:06,060
What? Yeah?

917
00:51:06,061 --> 00:51:08,428
It's beautiful here.

918
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:10,598
Really beautiful.
Okay, we'll just... we'll talk later.

919
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:12,734
Mm-hmm, okay.

920
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,769
All right. Bye.

921
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:18,739
Okay, try you later.
All right.

922
00:51:20,508 --> 00:51:22,675
Good reception.

923
00:51:22,677 --> 00:51:25,012
Look at that...
parents and their children

924
00:51:25,014 --> 00:51:27,280
on a college tour
eating lunch together.

925
00:51:28,817 --> 00:51:30,350
What a novel idea.

926
00:51:30,352 --> 00:51:32,419
I think it's overrated.

927
00:51:32,421 --> 00:51:36,423
You know, all I wanted was for
her to just let me have my day.

928
00:51:36,425 --> 00:51:39,359
She's not the one who's gonna
go here. I'm going here.

929
00:51:39,361 --> 00:51:41,694
And all I wanted was for her
to shut up and be present.

930
00:51:41,696 --> 00:51:43,229
Is that so much to ask for?

931
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:46,298
What's the big deal?
Just give her a call.

932
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:48,133
Yeah, but I shouldn't
have to give her a call.

933
00:51:48,136 --> 00:51:51,035
Why are you so angry?
I'm not angry.

934
00:51:53,339 --> 00:51:55,740
I should eat somewhere else.

935
00:51:55,742 --> 00:51:58,243
Wait.
What?

936
00:51:58,244 --> 00:52:00,312
Conrad, I'm sorry.

937
00:52:00,314 --> 00:52:02,314
Okay?

938
00:52:02,316 --> 00:52:04,550
I'm a nice person, I promise.

939
00:52:04,552 --> 00:52:07,119
Look, sometimes I push away
people I like.

940
00:52:07,121 --> 00:52:09,488
It's one of my few flaws.

941
00:52:13,293 --> 00:52:14,692
Please?

942
00:52:14,694 --> 00:52:16,961
Yeah, I'll stay.

943
00:52:24,436 --> 00:52:26,636
They have omelets.

944
00:52:29,874 --> 00:52:32,209
Would you excuse me
for a moment?

945
00:52:32,211 --> 00:52:34,743
I've got a bladder
the size of a ball bearing.

946
00:52:37,814 --> 00:52:39,849
Okay.

947
00:53:01,071 --> 00:53:03,639
Absolutely not.

948
00:53:03,641 --> 00:53:06,875
Do you want me
to call your mom?

949
00:53:06,877 --> 00:53:08,409
No.

950
00:53:08,411 --> 00:53:10,913
She's on a private tour
with the dean of students.

951
00:53:10,915 --> 00:53:12,514
Can you believe that?

952
00:53:25,661 --> 00:53:27,795
Hi. Yes, I'm Audrey Martin

953
00:53:27,797 --> 00:53:31,465
and I'm a rising freshman currently
on a tour of Middleton campus.

954
00:53:31,467 --> 00:53:34,902
Um, do you think
it would be possible

955
00:53:34,904 --> 00:53:36,405
to have a brief word
with Dean Pruitt?

956
00:53:36,407 --> 00:53:39,173
It's very important.

957
00:53:39,175 --> 00:53:41,042
Uh-huh.

958
00:53:42,977 --> 00:53:46,914
Yeah. Okay, thank you.

959
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:12,804
Excuse me.
Oh, shit.

960
00:54:12,807 --> 00:54:15,373
<i>Excuse me.</i>

961
00:54:16,943 --> 00:54:18,376
Hey.

962
00:54:18,378 --> 00:54:20,412
How was the tour with
the dean of students?

963
00:54:20,414 --> 00:54:23,547
The tour with the dean
of students, yes.

964
00:54:23,549 --> 00:54:26,686
It was... it was great.
It was great.

965
00:54:26,688 --> 00:54:29,988
We saw some fascinating...
have you seen the bell tower yet?

966
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:32,959
We saw the... we were up
into the bell tower.

967
00:54:32,961 --> 00:54:35,060
It's beautiful.
And we went into a class.

968
00:54:35,062 --> 00:54:37,963
We went into an acting class
and they taught us

969
00:54:37,965 --> 00:54:40,632
how to breathe... you know,
how the actors breathe.

970
00:54:40,634 --> 00:54:43,435
It was like...

971
00:54:43,437 --> 00:54:45,570
Ahh-hh.

972
00:54:45,572 --> 00:54:47,505
Gotta make a sound like that.

973
00:54:47,507 --> 00:54:49,672
Ahh-hh.

974
00:54:49,674 --> 00:54:53,010
The dean of students
is at a conference in Toronto.

975
00:54:55,181 --> 00:54:58,549
Ahh-hh.

976
00:55:02,486 --> 00:55:05,555
It's like...

977
00:55:05,557 --> 00:55:08,424
Excuse me.

978
00:55:08,426 --> 00:55:11,060
Okay, where's my mother?

979
00:55:11,062 --> 00:55:13,530
Uh, she's...

980
00:55:13,531 --> 00:55:15,299
planetarium.

981
00:55:15,301 --> 00:55:17,034
She said something
about the planetarium.

982
00:55:17,036 --> 00:55:20,137
It's an observatory.
Well, yes, exactly... the observatory.

983
00:55:20,139 --> 00:55:21,971
Yeah.
I've just been calling it the...

984
00:55:21,973 --> 00:55:23,172
planetarium.

985
00:55:23,174 --> 00:55:25,942
Have you seen Conrad?
Have you seen Conrad?

986
00:55:29,245 --> 00:55:32,180
Hey.
I just ran into your dad.

987
00:55:32,182 --> 00:55:34,549
Was he looking for me?
No.

988
00:55:34,551 --> 00:55:37,386
What's up with your mom?
I'm tracking her down.

989
00:55:37,389 --> 00:55:40,622
I cannot wait to find her deceitful
ass and expose her lie.

990
00:55:40,624 --> 00:55:42,390
What's the rush?

991
00:55:42,392 --> 00:55:45,627
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm a now kind of girl.

992
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,234
George.

993
00:55:57,506 --> 00:55:59,507
What are we doing here?

994
00:55:59,509 --> 00:56:01,443
We're having lunch.

995
00:56:01,444 --> 00:56:03,411
Is that what you call it...
having lunch?

996
00:56:03,413 --> 00:56:05,279
What do you call it,
George?

997
00:56:05,281 --> 00:56:06,514
Just look at me
straight in the eye

998
00:56:06,516 --> 00:56:09,083
and tell me that
we're just having lunch.

999
00:56:21,463 --> 00:56:23,997
I need...

1000
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:30,637
I need some...

1001
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:32,639
I need some ketchup.

1002
00:56:32,641 --> 00:56:34,307
Come here.
Hey, come on.

1003
00:56:34,309 --> 00:56:37,309
Edith, Edith, sit down.

1004
00:56:40,746 --> 00:56:43,281
Come on.

1005
00:56:43,283 --> 00:56:46,484
What just happened
in that acting class?

1006
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:48,521
What was that?

1007
00:56:48,523 --> 00:56:51,023
It was two adults making believe.
Making believe?

1008
00:56:51,025 --> 00:56:52,558
Is that what you call it...
making believe?

1009
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,093
Well, what do you call it, George?

1010
00:56:54,095 --> 00:56:56,962
Well, uh,

1011
00:56:56,965 --> 00:56:59,631
if you want to know the truth,
I'm afraid to give it a name.

1012
00:56:59,633 --> 00:57:02,267
Because what I've got swirling
in my head right now...

1013
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:07,039
it's scaring me half to death.

1014
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:12,744
I just saw your daughter.

1015
00:57:12,746 --> 00:57:14,379
Audrey is here?

1016
00:57:14,381 --> 00:57:16,413
No, she's not here.

1017
00:57:16,415 --> 00:57:19,082
She's not here because
I looked her in the eye

1018
00:57:19,084 --> 00:57:21,118
and I told her a lie.

1019
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,620
What did you say? She wanted
to know where you were

1020
00:57:23,622 --> 00:57:25,789
and I told her you were
at the planetarium.

1021
00:57:25,791 --> 00:57:28,692
No, I think it's an observatory.
Yes, I know. I've heard.

1022
00:57:30,728 --> 00:57:32,796
Why did you lie?

1023
00:57:32,798 --> 00:57:34,998
Because I don't want
our day to end.

1024
00:57:44,942 --> 00:57:46,511
Come on, help me out, Edith.

1025
00:57:49,946 --> 00:57:51,747
Say something.

1026
00:57:57,521 --> 00:57:59,889
What do you want me to say?
Say anything.

1027
00:57:59,891 --> 00:58:01,490
Tell me that this day
has meant more to you

1028
00:58:01,492 --> 00:58:03,726
than just killing time

1029
00:58:03,728 --> 00:58:05,960
or your daughter's
just looking at a college.

1030
00:58:05,962 --> 00:58:09,764
Tell me that.
Give me that much.

1031
00:58:09,766 --> 00:58:11,699
We're married.

1032
00:58:11,701 --> 00:58:13,601
And we have kids.
Hey, stop avoiding.

1033
00:58:13,603 --> 00:58:15,603
Listen to me, Edith, please.

1034
00:58:18,008 --> 00:58:20,675
Just tell me you feel
something for me

1035
00:58:20,677 --> 00:58:22,477
and I'm not imagining this.

1036
00:58:22,479 --> 00:58:25,346
We should probably
get back to our children.

1037
00:58:25,348 --> 00:58:26,981
Edith.
Okay, listen, I'm sorry.

1038
00:58:26,983 --> 00:58:28,382
Don't go. Listen.
Just talk to me a second.

1039
00:58:28,385 --> 00:58:29,884
I'm sorry, George.
Edith.

1040
00:58:29,886 --> 00:58:31,486
I'm sorry.

1041
00:58:31,488 --> 00:58:34,789
Edith. Edith.

1042
00:58:34,791 --> 00:58:38,826
<i>The college was founded in
1887 by Lowndes Pope Middleton,</i>

1043
00:58:38,828 --> 00:58:41,528
<i>who made his fortune as a seafaring
entrepreneur before devoting...</i>

1044
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:43,764
Excuse me.
Yes?

1045
00:58:43,767 --> 00:58:46,033
Where's the observatory? I've gotten
separated from my daughter.

1046
00:58:46,035 --> 00:58:48,735
It's on the hill behind Franklin.
I'm sorry, where's Franklin?

1047
00:58:48,737 --> 00:58:51,438
Excuse me, some of us
who didn't desert our children

1048
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,241
would like to continue
with the program.

1049
00:58:55,244 --> 00:58:58,111
I politely interrupt
to ask a simple question

1050
00:58:58,113 --> 00:59:00,646
and you think that gives you the right
to indict my parenting?

1051
00:59:00,648 --> 00:59:03,115
<i>Wow, look at you.</i>

1052
00:59:03,116 --> 00:59:04,283
Look at you.

1053
00:59:04,285 --> 00:59:06,285
You think you've got it
all worked out, huh?

1054
00:59:06,287 --> 00:59:08,987
Yeah, 18 years, right,

1055
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:11,990
of saying the right things,
making good choices,

1056
00:59:11,993 --> 00:59:14,327
telling yourself it all adds up
to little Johnny here

1057
00:59:14,329 --> 00:59:17,463
having what it takes
to skate through life, huh?

1058
00:59:17,465 --> 00:59:19,765
<i>Well, I've got news for you...</i>

1059
00:59:19,767 --> 00:59:21,467
it doesn't add up.

1060
00:59:21,469 --> 00:59:23,268
Nothing adds up.

1061
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:27,172
It's all just a feckless
dingleberry monkey garden.

1062
00:59:29,342 --> 00:59:31,343
Here's how it works, okay?

1063
00:59:31,345 --> 00:59:33,745
You love them.
They love you.

1064
00:59:33,747 --> 00:59:36,147
But after that, all bets are off.

1065
00:59:36,148 --> 00:59:38,782
After that, if you've done
your job right,

1066
00:59:38,784 --> 00:59:41,719
they just leave.

1067
00:59:41,721 --> 00:59:45,022
And you know where
that leaves you?

1068
00:59:45,024 --> 00:59:46,856
It leaves you alone
with a stranger

1069
00:59:46,858 --> 00:59:50,326
who you realize you haven't really
gotten to know over the last 18 years.

1070
01:00:00,272 --> 01:00:02,641
Look,

1071
01:00:02,642 --> 01:00:04,543
okay,

1072
01:00:04,545 --> 01:00:08,145
here's all you need to know
about the Middleton experience:

1073
01:00:08,147 --> 01:00:10,580
it doesn't include you.

1074
01:00:10,582 --> 01:00:13,650
George: Come on, let's go.
That was fun.

1075
01:00:17,788 --> 01:00:18,820
Excuse me?

1076
01:00:18,822 --> 01:00:20,557
Nothing.

1077
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:23,493
That was fun?
I'm sorry.

1078
01:00:29,465 --> 01:00:31,199
Sorry.

1079
01:00:34,971 --> 01:00:37,239
It's beautiful here in Middleton.

1080
01:00:37,241 --> 01:00:42,511
It's really beautiful.

1081
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:45,913
You need to celebrate.

1082
01:00:47,449 --> 01:00:50,051
You okay?

1083
01:00:54,756 --> 01:00:58,125
Maybe she's waiting for
you at your meeting.

1084
01:01:01,063 --> 01:01:04,198
I think it's locked.

1085
01:01:09,838 --> 01:01:12,439
This is unbelievable!
Where is she?

1086
01:01:14,442 --> 01:01:15,976
I'm done.

1087
01:01:15,978 --> 01:01:18,045
I think I'm just gonna go
to my meeting.

1088
01:01:18,047 --> 01:01:20,814
So you want to leave, too? What is this,
take-a-shit-on-Audrey day?

1089
01:01:20,816 --> 01:01:23,716
I don't mean this in a bad way,
but you're kind of a lot of work.

1090
01:01:23,718 --> 01:01:26,518
Oh, really?
Yeah.

1091
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,821
So we're taking
the gloves off, huh?

1092
01:01:28,823 --> 01:01:30,489
Please, Conrad,
I know you.

1093
01:01:30,491 --> 01:01:32,358
I know you better
than you know yourself.

1094
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:35,094
You think your million-dollar
smile will give you

1095
01:01:35,096 --> 01:01:37,763
an all-access
backstage pass to life?

1096
01:01:37,766 --> 01:01:39,799
You know what?
The fairy tale ends.

1097
01:01:39,801 --> 01:01:42,535
It's all downhill from here.

1098
01:01:42,537 --> 01:01:45,371
You've peaked.

1099
01:01:45,373 --> 01:01:47,139
Have a nice life.

1100
01:01:52,212 --> 01:01:54,247
Yeah, that's it.
Go ahead.

1101
01:01:54,249 --> 01:01:57,882
Confusion has a lot
of great soundtracks.

1102
01:02:04,155 --> 01:02:07,458
I'm going there.

1103
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:11,663
Audrey.

1104
01:02:11,665 --> 01:02:13,630
Conrad's meeting...

1105
01:02:13,632 --> 01:02:17,035
I gotta go this way.

1106
01:02:31,216 --> 01:02:33,684
These are definitely
not Bach's hands.

1107
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:43,993
Well...

1108
01:02:47,631 --> 01:02:49,832
Thank you.

1109
01:02:49,834 --> 01:02:53,169
What for?

1110
01:03:07,918 --> 01:03:10,752
Bye, Edith.

1111
01:04:55,087 --> 01:04:58,656
Edith?

1112
01:05:08,432 --> 01:05:11,701
What's the matter?

1113
01:05:11,703 --> 01:05:15,138
Uh... oh.

1114
01:05:17,509 --> 01:05:19,309
What's going on?

1115
01:05:19,311 --> 01:05:21,543
I didn't want anyone
else to hear.

1116
01:05:21,545 --> 01:05:24,279
Hear what?
What I have to say.

1117
01:05:24,281 --> 01:05:26,715
Edith, we just said good-bye.

1118
01:05:26,717 --> 01:05:31,253
No, you said good-bye.
I didn't say anything.

1119
01:05:31,255 --> 01:05:35,623
I just... I don't want
to be rushed.

1120
01:05:35,625 --> 01:05:40,028
Uh...

1121
01:05:48,004 --> 01:05:49,937
Edith.
Yes?

1122
01:05:49,939 --> 01:05:52,139
I'm a board-certified
cardiac surgeon.

1123
01:05:52,141 --> 01:05:54,276
I'm hiding in a dark room
from a hallway of people

1124
01:05:54,278 --> 01:05:55,610
who can't legally
rent a car.

1125
01:05:55,613 --> 01:05:59,081
Okay, I get it.

1126
01:05:59,083 --> 01:06:02,451
Okay, George, um...

1127
01:06:03,886 --> 01:06:06,787
I don't want to say good-bye.

1128
01:06:08,022 --> 01:06:11,758
This makes me happy.

1129
01:06:15,196 --> 01:06:17,497
Say something.

1130
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,807
No, don't stop.

1131
01:06:27,809 --> 01:06:29,677
You guys are so sweet,

1132
01:06:29,678 --> 01:06:33,146
sneaking off to the projection
room to steal a kiss.

1133
01:06:33,148 --> 01:06:34,347
No, we're...
No, no, no, no.

1134
01:06:34,349 --> 01:06:36,082
No, we're not stea...
No, we're... we're...

1135
01:06:36,084 --> 01:06:39,385
It's just that we haven't seen
each other in a long time.

1136
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:46,124
I'm Daphne.
I could kill you, Edith.

1137
01:06:46,126 --> 01:06:48,727
Hi. George. How are you?
Hi.

1138
01:06:48,728 --> 01:06:50,162
Nice to meet you.
I'm Edith.

1139
01:06:50,164 --> 01:06:51,296
Hi.

1140
01:06:53,333 --> 01:06:55,033
Oh, my God.

1141
01:06:55,035 --> 01:06:57,268
You know this?
What?

1142
01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:58,736
No. What is it?

1143
01:06:58,738 --> 01:07:01,171
"Les Parapluies de Cherbourg. "

1144
01:07:01,174 --> 01:07:03,608
I haven't seen this in 20 years.

1145
01:07:03,609 --> 01:07:05,043
English, please.

1146
01:07:05,045 --> 01:07:08,279
"Umbrellas of Cherbourg. "
Oh. What's it about?

1147
01:07:08,281 --> 01:07:11,916
It's about young love.

1148
01:07:11,918 --> 01:07:13,218
Who's the woman?

1149
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:15,321
That's a 20-year-old
Catherine Deneuve.

1150
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:17,789
19. Yeah?
What's her name?

1151
01:07:17,791 --> 01:07:19,123
Wow.
Geneviève.

1152
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:21,792
Geneviève, right.
And she falls in love with...

1153
01:07:21,794 --> 01:07:24,294
Guy.
Guy. Guy.

1154
01:07:26,531 --> 01:07:29,333
They're so beautiful.

1155
01:07:31,336 --> 01:07:32,935
How does it end?

1156
01:07:32,937 --> 01:07:35,439
That's cheating,
George.

1157
01:07:35,441 --> 01:07:39,176
And, you know, French films are
always complicated, aren't they?

1158
01:07:39,178 --> 01:07:41,944
Oh, always.

1159
01:07:45,916 --> 01:07:49,919
I got a call from the hospital.
I gotta take this.

1160
01:07:49,921 --> 01:07:51,521
I'm sorry.
Nice meeting you.

1161
01:07:51,523 --> 01:07:53,089
<i>Bye.</i>

1162
01:07:53,091 --> 01:07:54,723
<i>Congratulations to</i>

1163
01:07:54,725 --> 01:07:58,293
<i>the Middleton public safety
officers Kleiman and Tallis</i>

1164
01:07:58,295 --> 01:08:00,997
<i>for the successful recovery
of two bicycles</i>

1165
01:08:00,999 --> 01:08:03,466
<i>stolen earlier today

1166
01:08:03,468 --> 01:08:06,302
<i>to be musical bandits.</i>

1167
01:08:06,304 --> 01:08:09,372
<i>And to all you aspiring Otters
out there,</i>

1168
01:08:09,374 --> 01:08:11,639
<i>today will be the last
school-sanctioned</i>

1169
01:08:11,642 --> 01:08:13,908
<i>Fountain Friday
of the year,</i>

1170
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:18,346
<i>so feel free to get
weird and get wet.</i>

1171
01:08:18,348 --> 01:08:20,615
<i>This Sugarwolf song
is dedicated</i>

1172
01:08:20,617 --> 01:08:24,352
<i>to my fifth-grade teacher
Owen Perlmutter.</i>

1173
01:08:24,354 --> 01:08:27,722
<i>It's called "Bad Name. "</i>

1174
01:08:42,436 --> 01:08:44,470
Take a seat.

1175
01:08:44,472 --> 01:08:46,839
Does your watch say 2:00?

1176
01:08:46,841 --> 01:08:48,675
Because my watch
broke years ago,

1177
01:08:48,677 --> 01:08:51,178
but I know you are late.

1178
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:52,579
Sorry. I just wanted to...

1179
01:08:52,581 --> 01:08:55,115
First lesson of radio: don't be late.

1180
01:08:55,117 --> 01:08:57,517
Silence is death.

1181
01:08:57,519 --> 01:08:59,653
I... Uh, uh, if it doesn't involve

1182
01:08:59,655 --> 01:09:01,722
you and a coed,
I don't want to hear about it.

1183
01:09:01,724 --> 01:09:03,156
What's your name?
Conrad.

1184
01:09:03,158 --> 01:09:05,324
Conrad. That's great.
We'll change it.

1185
01:09:05,326 --> 01:09:08,593
Boneyard Sims.
Welcome to radio, my brother.

1186
01:09:10,797 --> 01:09:13,165
Okay, here's how we rock.

1187
01:09:13,167 --> 01:09:14,733
I've got to be there for Larry.

1188
01:09:14,736 --> 01:09:16,334
Who's Larry?
George's patient.

1189
01:09:16,336 --> 01:09:19,071
Where's the nearest computer?
Oh, that would be mine. Come on.

1190
01:09:19,073 --> 01:09:21,639
Well, what about the movie?
I know how it ends.

1191
01:09:39,059 --> 01:09:41,493
Hi. I have an appointment
with Dr. Emerson.

1192
01:09:43,628 --> 01:09:46,097
Audrey Martin?
Yes.

1193
01:09:50,334 --> 01:09:53,537
I heard he refuses to sponsor
freshmen or sophomores

1194
01:09:53,539 --> 01:09:55,206
for independent study.

1195
01:09:55,208 --> 01:09:56,439
Is it true?

1196
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:58,575
You'll need to talk
to Dr. Emerson about that.

1197
01:10:05,483 --> 01:10:08,084
Is it true he works "The Times"
Sunday crossword puzzle

1198
01:10:08,086 --> 01:10:09,219
in under an hour?

1199
01:10:09,221 --> 01:10:10,787
In pen.

1200
01:10:11,989 --> 01:10:14,757
Do you know
if he ever got my letters?

1201
01:10:14,759 --> 01:10:17,192
All six of them.

1202
01:10:17,195 --> 01:10:19,061
Miss Martin.

1203
01:10:19,063 --> 01:10:21,130
Hi. It's very nice to meet you.

1204
01:10:21,132 --> 01:10:23,164
Welcome.
Thank you.

1205
01:10:23,166 --> 01:10:25,768
Would you like some tea?
Yes, love it.

1206
01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:28,737
Hold on one second.
I gotta access our BP.

1207
01:10:30,807 --> 01:10:32,841
She's all yours, George.

1208
01:10:40,048 --> 01:10:42,451
There it is.

1209
01:10:48,526 --> 01:10:50,858
Whoa.

1210
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:53,227
Is that...?

1211
01:10:53,229 --> 01:10:54,961
Is that an angiography?

1212
01:10:54,963 --> 01:10:58,099
George, Edith,
this is my boyfriend Travis.

1213
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:00,500
What up?
He's premed.

1214
01:11:00,502 --> 01:11:02,569
George is a cardiac surgeon

1215
01:11:02,571 --> 01:11:06,640
and he's trying to save
Larry's life online.

1216
01:11:07,875 --> 01:11:10,143
Is that Larry's heart?

1217
01:11:10,145 --> 01:11:13,014
What's left of it.

1218
01:11:13,016 --> 01:11:14,915
Yeah, call that in, dude.

1219
01:11:14,918 --> 01:11:16,584
Yeah. Yeah,
we're gonna have to get

1220
01:11:16,586 --> 01:11:19,153
Larry in surgery immediately.

1221
01:11:19,154 --> 01:11:21,555
Yeah, call Rob,
tell him to scrub in.

1222
01:11:21,557 --> 01:11:23,858
And tell Larry I'm sorry
I'm not there for him.

1223
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:26,660
<i>I'll be checking in and I'll
see him in the morning.</i>

1224
01:11:26,663 --> 01:11:28,094
Okay, thanks.

1225
01:11:35,836 --> 01:11:39,071
I've got a patient who's so
afraid to die that he can't live.

1226
01:11:39,073 --> 01:11:41,573
I've got a son
that most of the time

1227
01:11:41,575 --> 01:11:44,276
probably wishes
I were dead.

1228
01:11:44,278 --> 01:11:48,112
And I'm living a day
that's making me realize

1229
01:11:48,114 --> 01:11:50,182
I have been dead.

1230
01:11:50,184 --> 01:11:53,418
Damn, George.

1231
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:55,920
That's a tad dark.
Yeah.

1232
01:11:55,922 --> 01:11:57,956
You need to take the edge off.

1233
01:11:57,958 --> 01:11:59,990
Actually,
I could use a drink.

1234
01:11:59,993 --> 01:12:03,462
You're out of luck on that.
We're only 20, so...

1235
01:12:03,464 --> 01:12:05,396
but we...

1236
01:12:05,398 --> 01:12:07,232
yeah?

1237
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:15,272
The white dragon.

1238
01:12:17,442 --> 01:12:19,443
Yeah.

1239
01:12:19,445 --> 01:12:22,213
Whew. It's epic.

1240
01:12:24,216 --> 01:12:25,415
I've never...

1241
01:12:31,022 --> 01:12:33,357
Here.
Oh, thank you.

1242
01:12:33,359 --> 01:12:35,658
You're welcome.

1243
01:12:43,333 --> 01:12:46,269
Well...

1244
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:48,437
I read "The Philosophy
of Language" in ninth grade

1245
01:12:48,439 --> 01:12:50,173
and it changed my life.

1246
01:12:50,174 --> 01:12:52,108
Really?
Absolutely.

1247
01:12:52,110 --> 01:12:54,543
It's so simple,
yet so passionate.

1248
01:12:54,545 --> 01:12:57,413
And from the first paragraph,

1249
01:12:57,415 --> 01:12:59,649
I knew that I was
in the hands of a genius.

1250
01:12:59,651 --> 01:13:01,317
And I felt so privileged
to be able

1251
01:13:01,319 --> 01:13:04,186
to share so intimately
in his mind and his soul.

1252
01:13:04,188 --> 01:13:06,555
Well,

1253
01:13:06,557 --> 01:13:08,690
what can I say?

1254
01:13:17,465 --> 01:13:20,534
"The most important element
in all forms of communication

1255
01:13:20,536 --> 01:13:24,672
is understanding the language
of what isn't being said. "

1256
01:13:24,674 --> 01:13:26,740
Good afternoon,
Dr. Emerson.

1257
01:13:26,741 --> 01:13:28,709
Tea?

1258
01:13:28,711 --> 01:13:30,611
Oh, yes.

1259
01:13:32,646 --> 01:13:34,213
I can't imagine
you're a student.

1260
01:13:34,215 --> 01:13:36,785
A student of life, my friend.

1261
01:13:40,188 --> 01:13:41,989
That was the Oath

1262
01:13:41,991 --> 01:13:44,224
from Charlottesville, Virginia.

1263
01:13:44,226 --> 01:13:46,161
And if you ask me,
they have all the pieces

1264
01:13:46,162 --> 01:13:48,929
to become a really
mediocre band.

1265
01:13:48,931 --> 01:13:51,498
Less bullying
and more music, boys.

1266
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:56,235
Okay, Boneyard Sims
on a lazy Friday afternoon.

1267
01:13:56,236 --> 01:13:59,604
Don't you matriculators
have some homework to do?

1268
01:14:02,076 --> 01:14:03,743
Where were we?

1269
01:14:03,745 --> 01:14:05,177
Lesson number four.

1270
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:07,512
Oh, yes, lesson number four:

1271
01:14:07,514 --> 01:14:09,247
know your audience.

1272
01:14:09,249 --> 01:14:11,350
It's all about making
a connection.

1273
01:14:11,352 --> 01:14:13,318
That's the beauty of radio.

1274
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,787
Something goes on between you
and the people out there.

1275
01:14:15,789 --> 01:14:18,022
It's living and changing
moment to moment.

1276
01:14:18,025 --> 01:14:20,692
You can't see it,
but you can feel it.

1277
01:14:20,694 --> 01:14:23,328
And you can't get that on VH1.

1278
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:25,431
What are you listening to?

1279
01:14:25,433 --> 01:14:27,966
What are you listening to?
Oh.

1280
01:14:27,968 --> 01:14:32,337
# Hang me tight,
I'm gone from it all #

1281
01:14:32,339 --> 01:14:36,674
# Bring me down,
this town #

1282
01:14:36,676 --> 01:14:38,642
# I love to love... #

1283
01:14:38,644 --> 01:14:42,079
Shit. Shit. Shit.

1284
01:14:42,081 --> 01:14:44,448
Bullshit.
More shit.

1285
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:48,051
Horseshit. Cow shit.
More shit.

1286
01:14:48,053 --> 01:14:50,621
You got a great ear, kid.
I think you're a natural.

1287
01:14:50,623 --> 01:14:52,155
Beer?

1288
01:14:52,157 --> 01:14:54,825
Uh, no,
I'd better not.

1289
01:14:54,827 --> 01:14:56,360
Good call.
More for me.

1290
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:04,366
Sláinte.

1291
01:15:04,369 --> 01:15:06,469
# Oh, yeah #

1292
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:08,370
# The reggae beat #

1293
01:15:08,373 --> 01:15:12,207
# Yeah... #

1294
01:15:16,646 --> 01:15:21,050
# I'm a cardiac surgeon, yeah. #

1295
01:15:28,892 --> 01:15:32,194
Isn't it supposed to be the kids
that are going away to college

1296
01:15:32,196 --> 01:15:35,164
and smoking weed
behind the parents' back?

1297
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:43,905
So what's the word?
Are you guys digging Middleton?

1298
01:15:43,907 --> 01:15:45,840
Your kids are gonna
go here or what?

1299
01:15:45,842 --> 01:15:48,408
Yes.
No.

1300
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:51,878
<i>I gotta say, man,
in my short life,</i>

1301
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:56,616
you two are the coolest parents
I've ever seen.

1302
01:15:56,618 --> 01:15:59,319
Aw, thank you.

1303
01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:00,888
Where did you guys meet?

1304
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:02,790
College.

1305
01:16:07,094 --> 01:16:09,163
<i>Yeah.</i>

1306
01:16:09,165 --> 01:16:11,631
You got one.

1307
01:16:11,633 --> 01:16:13,868
So as I was saying,
the trouble with Chomsky is

1308
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:15,669
he can't leave his politics
out of it.

1309
01:16:15,671 --> 01:16:17,736
Now, that, for me, in my view,

1310
01:16:17,738 --> 01:16:19,940
compromises his science.

1311
01:16:19,942 --> 01:16:22,808
Some would say Chomsky
is just true to his conscience.

1312
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:24,511
Ah.

1313
01:16:24,512 --> 01:16:25,911
Advise me.

1314
01:16:25,913 --> 01:16:28,280
Oh, I think you've worked it out
pretty well on your own.

1315
01:16:28,282 --> 01:16:32,184
No, I mean,
be my advisor next year.

1316
01:16:32,186 --> 01:16:34,720
I will not let you down.

1317
01:16:34,722 --> 01:16:36,655
You're a very serious
young woman.

1318
01:16:36,657 --> 01:16:38,457
Well, thank you.

1319
01:16:38,459 --> 01:16:42,494
I didn't quite mean it
as a compliment.

1320
01:16:42,496 --> 01:16:44,028
It sounds as though

1321
01:16:44,030 --> 01:16:46,465
you're hurrying somewhere
in such a way

1322
01:16:46,467 --> 01:16:49,668
that the journey will yield
very little pleasure.

1323
01:16:51,036 --> 01:16:53,238
Slow down.

1324
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:55,240
<i>College should not
necessarily be about</i>

1325
01:16:55,242 --> 01:16:57,008
<i>narrowing your focus.</i>

1326
01:16:57,010 --> 01:17:00,645
It's about broadening
your experience.

1327
01:17:03,048 --> 01:17:07,285
I'm sorry,
but I can't be your advisor.

1328
01:17:07,287 --> 01:17:10,288
Okay, I know you don't
take on freshmen,

1329
01:17:10,290 --> 01:17:12,056
but with my AP credits,

1330
01:17:12,058 --> 01:17:15,292
I'm technically entering
Middleton as a sophomore.

1331
01:17:15,295 --> 01:17:17,862
I'm leaving Middleton.

1332
01:17:17,864 --> 01:17:21,499
At the end of next week,
as a matter of fact.

1333
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:23,934
Are you going
to another school?

1334
01:17:23,937 --> 01:17:25,736
I'm going on a sabbatical.

1335
01:17:25,738 --> 01:17:27,904
Right.

1336
01:17:27,906 --> 01:17:30,339
There's a remnant of a Sioux tribe
in South Dakota

1337
01:17:30,341 --> 01:17:32,375
that I've arranged to study.

1338
01:17:32,377 --> 01:17:35,477
And I won't be in residence
for the next four years.

1339
01:17:38,249 --> 01:17:40,650
You can't do this to me.

1340
01:17:40,652 --> 01:17:41,851
I'm sorry?

1341
01:17:41,853 --> 01:17:44,087
You're all I thought about
this last year.

1342
01:17:44,089 --> 01:17:47,123
There are other linguistics
professors at Middleton.

1343
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:48,457
Well, I don't want
other professors.

1344
01:17:48,459 --> 01:17:49,825
I want you.

1345
01:17:49,827 --> 01:17:51,794
Audrey, I...
Miss Martin.

1346
01:17:51,796 --> 01:17:53,896
Miss Martin...
Is this what this is all about...

1347
01:17:53,898 --> 01:17:56,531
tea at the faculty club,
I'll let her down easy?

1348
01:17:56,533 --> 01:17:59,702
Fuck South Dakota!

1349
01:17:59,703 --> 01:18:01,536
Hmm.

1350
01:18:01,538 --> 01:18:05,072
Okay.

1351
01:18:05,074 --> 01:18:07,309
Please excuse me.

1352
01:18:11,847 --> 01:18:15,082
The line between
ambition and obsession

1353
01:18:15,084 --> 01:18:17,685
is much thinner
than one might imagine.

1354
01:18:17,687 --> 01:18:20,020
You would be well
served to look down

1355
01:18:20,022 --> 01:18:23,657
and see exactly
where you are standing.

1356
01:18:41,443 --> 01:18:44,677
I can't believe
my baby is leaving me.

1357
01:18:48,016 --> 01:18:51,384
# It's been a long time
coming down... #

1358
01:18:54,222 --> 01:18:58,790
Conrad doesn't even know
what's in store for him.

1359
01:18:58,792 --> 01:19:02,028
He's gonna get his buttocks
handed to him.

1360
01:19:02,030 --> 01:19:06,698
Where did the last 17 years go?

1361
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:09,601
Sleepovers, soccer games,
slamming doors.

1362
01:19:09,603 --> 01:19:11,436
Yeah.

1363
01:19:11,438 --> 01:19:15,340
I mean, I don't feel like the way
that I thought I would feel

1364
01:19:15,342 --> 01:19:16,541
when this happened.

1365
01:19:16,543 --> 01:19:18,410
How do you feel?

1366
01:19:18,412 --> 01:19:20,979
Young!
You are young.

1367
01:19:20,981 --> 01:19:24,115
Who defines young
as having a child in college?

1368
01:19:31,891 --> 01:19:33,958
Larry.

1369
01:19:33,961 --> 01:19:36,061
Heart Attack Larry.

1370
01:19:48,339 --> 01:19:50,873
I won't have to wait up
till 1:00 in the morning

1371
01:19:50,875 --> 01:19:53,309
listening for Audrey
to come home.

1372
01:19:53,311 --> 01:19:55,845
I won't have to fumigate his room

1373
01:19:55,847 --> 01:19:57,914
twice a year.

1374
01:20:12,964 --> 01:20:14,998
# Yeah... #

1375
01:21:17,959 --> 01:21:19,458
Please, come on.

1376
01:21:21,361 --> 01:21:24,363
<i>Hi, it's Edith. Leave a message.
I'll call you back.</i>

1377
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:50,955
It's okay, George.

1378
01:21:50,957 --> 01:21:55,094
I still respect you.
Mm.

1379
01:21:55,095 --> 01:21:57,862
Yeah, I respect you, too, George.

1380
01:21:57,864 --> 01:22:02,300
You know, I'd let you
dig around in my chest.

1381
01:22:02,302 --> 01:22:07,038
Of course, not today,
but, you know...

1382
01:22:07,639 --> 01:22:09,707
George,

1383
01:22:09,708 --> 01:22:12,943
can I tell you a story?

1384
01:22:12,945 --> 01:22:16,279
When I was a kid,
we had this dog.

1385
01:22:16,281 --> 01:22:19,950
This dog had a ball sack...

1386
01:22:19,952 --> 01:22:25,422
oh, yeah...
that was abnormally large.

1387
01:22:25,424 --> 01:22:27,858
When I say large,
I mean it looked like

1388
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:29,993
somebody had grabbed him

1389
01:22:29,995 --> 01:22:33,229
and just shoved
two Crenshaw melons

1390
01:22:33,232 --> 01:22:35,231
inside of his nut sack.

1391
01:22:35,234 --> 01:22:37,534
<i>Anyway, one day</i>

1392
01:22:37,536 --> 01:22:40,136
<i>the dog got sick, okay?</i>

1393
01:22:40,138 --> 01:22:42,471
It had a liver thing or something.

1394
01:22:42,473 --> 01:22:45,975
And the sicker the dog got,

1395
01:22:45,978 --> 01:22:48,144
the smaller

1396
01:22:48,146 --> 01:22:50,078
the ball sack got.

1397
01:22:50,081 --> 01:22:52,813
Hmm.

1398
01:22:52,816 --> 01:22:57,385
The vet says he's never seen
anything like it.

1399
01:22:57,387 --> 01:23:00,889
You know what I think, George?

1400
01:23:00,890 --> 01:23:03,824
The ball sack

1401
01:23:03,827 --> 01:23:07,229
is life.

1402
01:23:07,231 --> 01:23:08,729
Hmm.

1403
01:23:08,731 --> 01:23:12,033
The ball sack is life.

1404
01:23:12,035 --> 01:23:14,069
Exactly.

1405
01:23:14,071 --> 01:23:16,504
I was sure that
there was gonna be

1406
01:23:16,506 --> 01:23:18,941
a point in there
somewhere, but...

1407
01:23:18,943 --> 01:23:21,409
Yeah.

1408
01:23:24,981 --> 01:23:26,981
The ball sack is life.
The ball sack is life.

1409
01:23:26,983 --> 01:23:29,315
The ball sack is life.

1410
01:23:29,317 --> 01:23:32,318
Come on, let's go!
Come on!

1411
01:23:34,122 --> 01:23:35,522
Yo, it's Fountain Friday?

1412
01:23:35,524 --> 01:23:37,892
Oh, yeah.

1413
01:23:37,894 --> 01:23:39,994
- It's Fountain Friday?
- Yes.

1414
01:23:39,995 --> 01:23:41,528
Are you guys in?

1415
01:23:41,530 --> 01:23:44,697
By my count,
it's Fountain Friday,

1416
01:23:44,699 --> 01:23:47,467
so get in that water,
all you crazy kids,

1417
01:23:47,469 --> 01:23:49,402
and don't forget
your sunscreen.

1418
01:23:49,404 --> 01:23:52,338
Now to play some music
for all you revelers

1419
01:23:52,339 --> 01:23:55,475
is our guest DJ Con Fab.

1420
01:23:55,477 --> 01:23:59,344
That's Con for Conrad
and Fab for "fabulous. "

1421
01:23:59,346 --> 01:24:02,015
Take it away, pilgrim.

1422
01:24:05,853 --> 01:24:09,856
Um, this is for all you
reluctant Middletonians

1423
01:24:09,857 --> 01:24:12,824
who are thinking about not
getting in that fountain today.

1424
01:24:12,826 --> 01:24:16,661
Do yourselves a favor,
get in the water now.

1425
01:24:16,664 --> 01:24:20,298
You might be thinking
it's too uncool or stupid,

1426
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:23,200
but you'll never know
how you really feel about it

1427
01:24:23,202 --> 01:24:25,036
until you jump in.

1428
01:24:25,039 --> 01:24:27,239
Go ahead.

1429
01:24:27,241 --> 01:24:29,407
Give it a chance.

1430
01:24:29,410 --> 01:24:32,209
And, hey,
you just might like it.

1431
01:24:36,047 --> 01:24:38,148
This is usually
where we play a song.

1432
01:24:38,151 --> 01:24:43,153
I've got a little over six million.
Help yourself.

1433
01:24:43,154 --> 01:24:46,189
Um...

1434
01:25:02,375 --> 01:25:05,275
Not bad, kid.

1435
01:25:05,277 --> 01:25:08,345
Not bad.

1436
01:25:08,347 --> 01:25:12,514
Not bad at all.

1437
01:25:29,932 --> 01:25:31,866
That's my son.

1438
01:25:31,869 --> 01:25:33,702
That's Conrad.

1439
01:25:56,576 --> 01:26:00,863
# Would you rather be more
than the things that you say #

1440
01:26:01,516 --> 01:26:06,371
# Just be the words that you
sing to yourself in your head #

1441
01:26:07,735 --> 01:26:13,272
# When nobody's around? #

1442
01:26:13,274 --> 01:26:16,942
# Or would you rather be
a part of the crowd #

1443
01:26:16,945 --> 01:26:21,248
# Or just a single sound #

1444
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:26,385
# Waiting to be heard? #

1445
01:26:26,387 --> 01:26:32,558
# Do you know what I mean? #

1446
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:38,222
# Well, you could be
one of the lovers or liars #

1447
01:26:38,756 --> 01:26:43,836
# Hiding all the things they do
on the back of their hands #

1448
01:26:44,671 --> 01:26:50,875
# Well, it's just you and me #

1449
01:26:50,877 --> 01:26:55,146
# 'Cause everybody's got
a little wrong #

1450
01:26:55,148 --> 01:26:58,715
# In all the right places #

1451
01:26:58,717 --> 01:27:02,552
# Just depends on
where you are... #

1452
01:27:39,357 --> 01:27:41,624
Come on.

1453
01:28:30,272 --> 01:28:32,772
You were so right.

1454
01:28:32,774 --> 01:28:34,341
About what?

1455
01:28:34,343 --> 01:28:36,343
About everything.

1456
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:30,895
Hey.
Hey.

1457
01:29:30,897 --> 01:29:34,265
I just wanted to say I'm sorry
about what happened today.

1458
01:29:34,266 --> 01:29:36,633
Yeah, me, too.

1459
01:29:36,635 --> 01:29:39,937
I was wrong about this place.

1460
01:29:39,939 --> 01:29:42,473
I think I could go here.

1461
01:29:42,475 --> 01:29:44,942
Well, you couldn't pay me
to go here.

1462
01:29:44,944 --> 01:29:46,644
Bad day, huh?

1463
01:29:46,646 --> 01:29:48,679
Catastrophic.

1464
01:29:48,681 --> 01:29:51,448
I'm sorry to hear that.

1465
01:29:51,451 --> 01:29:54,218
It's not your fault.

1466
01:30:00,024 --> 01:30:01,758
I like you better
without the leash.

1467
01:30:31,921 --> 01:30:33,889
Not yet.

1468
01:31:00,115 --> 01:31:04,818
I... I don't think we can...

1469
01:31:06,921 --> 01:31:09,955
Yeah. No.

1470
01:31:12,626 --> 01:31:13,926
I thought you fixed hearts.

1471
01:31:31,877 --> 01:31:34,046
It ends badly, doesn't it?

1472
01:31:34,048 --> 01:31:35,748
What do you mean?

1473
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:38,416
The French movie...

1474
01:31:38,418 --> 01:31:42,355
it ends badly.

1475
01:31:42,357 --> 01:31:46,124
That's what makes it
so special.

1476
01:32:00,371 --> 01:32:01,840
Well, this can't be good.

1477
01:32:05,211 --> 01:32:07,345
Hey, what happened to you?

1478
01:32:07,347 --> 01:32:09,913
I mean, where have you been?
Why haven't you answered my calls?

1479
01:32:09,915 --> 01:32:13,016
Here.

1480
01:32:15,453 --> 01:32:18,088
Okay.

1481
01:32:29,099 --> 01:32:31,534
<i>Let's go.</i>

1482
01:32:33,904 --> 01:32:37,940
I need you to drive.

1483
01:33:12,808 --> 01:33:14,842
Should I take 90 or Highway 2?

1484
01:33:25,821 --> 01:33:29,023
What happened
to your glasses?

1485
01:34:52,036 --> 01:34:53,702
Mom.

1486
01:35:07,584 --> 01:35:10,085
We're gonna be okay.

1487
01:35:15,426 --> 01:35:18,895
You were right.

1488
01:35:18,897 --> 01:35:21,730
Middleton's not so bad.

1489
01:35:36,845 --> 01:35:38,479
Let's take
the long way home.
