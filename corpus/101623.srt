1
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,763
Where are you going?

2
00:00:50,934 --> 00:00:55,997
<i>The 2: 15 to Mont Laurier</i>
<i>will be loading at gate number 10.</i>

3
00:01:01,511 --> 00:01:03,638
One ticket, please. Mont Laurier.

4
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:13,247
Do you mind? The guy in the back,
he won't stop snoring.

5
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,389
No. Sure.

6
00:01:19,596 --> 00:01:21,291
I'm Matt.

7
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:24,195
- I'm Martin.
- Hey, Martin. Nice to meet you.

8
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:27,268
- Nice to meet you.
- Where you headed to?

9
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:29,636
Just as far away as I can get.

10
00:01:30,807 --> 00:01:32,968
Well, I'll drink to that, brother.

11
00:01:39,449 --> 00:01:41,144
Cheers.

12
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:55,691
I think we got a little engine trouble
here, folks. Just sit tight.

13
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:58,766
Man! You know, the same thing
happened in St. Lawrence.

14
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,629
We had to sit tight for nearly eight hours.

15
00:02:01,805 --> 00:02:05,673
Hell, this sucks. This totally sucks.

16
00:02:08,111 --> 00:02:10,636
Three hundred and eighty-five dollars.
Cash only.

17
00:02:10,814 --> 00:02:12,611
All I got is my dad's credit card.

18
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,815
You can't read?

19
00:02:16,085 --> 00:02:18,019
Cash only.

20
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:24,249
- You have a license?
- I had one. They took it away, though.

21
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,529
Looks like you're driving.

22
00:02:46,616 --> 00:02:48,140
See that?

23
00:02:51,955 --> 00:02:53,183
Fake.

24
00:02:53,356 --> 00:02:55,415
- What happened?
- Courtesy of my stepdad.

25
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:58,993
Hit me so hard I flew across the kitchen,
dented the Sheetrock.

26
00:02:59,162 --> 00:03:00,857
My mom watched the whole thing.

27
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,590
- Why?
- Why does he do half the things he does?

28
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:07,293
Fucking psycho,
200 pounds of worthless grease.

29
00:03:07,503 --> 00:03:09,437
But I got him back.

30
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:10,900
What? You popped him?

31
00:03:11,074 --> 00:03:15,101
Got me a tour of hell, though. Had me
in military school by the next morning.

32
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,042
But I don't believe in following
people's rules, man.

33
00:03:18,214 --> 00:03:22,082
Fuck people, fuck their rules.
That's why I jumped the wall two days ago.

34
00:03:22,252 --> 00:03:24,777
Now I'm going to Seattle to play music.

35
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,301
Jesus Christ.

36
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:51,472
I'm so sorry, man. I'm an idiot,
I wasn't paying attention.

37
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,172
No. Forget about it, man.

38
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:56,045
We're lucky this piece of shit
had a spare. Fuck.

39
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:58,744
You ever changed a tire before, Martin?

40
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:01,789
Didn't think so. Cool.

41
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:05,216
Okay. What do we got here?

42
00:04:05,395 --> 00:04:08,887
Oh, yeah, I'll have us back on the road
in no time, no time at all.

43
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:11,499
But this time, I'm driving. Cool?

44
00:04:16,606 --> 00:04:18,073
Fucker's on tight.

45
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,457
First one's kind of always the hardest. After
that, the rest of them come off pretty easy.

46
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:48,660
You and I are about the same height, man.

47
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,771
What?

48
00:06:14,557 --> 00:06:16,024
Be quiet.

49
00:10:05,588 --> 00:10:08,785
Officer. Officer, I need your help.

50
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,926
I just saw my son on the ferry.

51
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,857
My son is dead.

52
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,991
He died 19 years ago,
but this was my son.

53
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:23,798
He walked straight in front of me.
We had eye contact.

54
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:25,371
He recognized me.

55
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:27,973
A mother's not wrong
about things like this.

56
00:10:29,612 --> 00:10:32,274
How can I explain
how dangerous he was, how...?

57
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,545
No, not "was."

58
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:39,786
Is.

59
00:10:40,756 --> 00:10:44,317
My son is a very dangerous man.

60
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:55,501
- What are you doing?
- Preparing a briefing for Agent Scott.

61
00:10:56,672 --> 00:10:58,299
Agent Scott?

62
00:10:58,474 --> 00:11:02,934
I don't understand why he needs someone
else. We've got everything under control.

63
00:11:03,112 --> 00:11:06,707
- We don't have anything, Joseph.
- Because we didn't have enough time.

64
00:11:06,882 --> 00:11:09,817
- We need a couple more days, that's it.
- She here yet?

65
00:11:10,186 --> 00:11:14,213
She was on the flight. They can't find her.
Gérard is checking baggage claim.

66
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:18,520
- She's going to be advising, right?
- This isn't about territory, Paquette.

67
00:11:18,694 --> 00:11:20,753
There hasn't been
a murder like this in years.

68
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,366
And the first thing you do is
bring in someone else. Come on.

69
00:11:24,533 --> 00:11:27,229
I have a strange feeling about this murder.

70
00:11:27,703 --> 00:11:30,331
We need help. We have nothing.

71
00:11:30,873 --> 00:11:33,706
You call me as soon as she gets here.

72
00:12:23,926 --> 00:12:25,860
You got to be fucking kidding me.

73
00:12:26,028 --> 00:12:29,054
- Special Agent Scott?
- Yes.

74
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:32,700
We were waiting for you at the station.

75
00:12:32,868 --> 00:12:35,860
- That's a grave, you know.
- Yes, I know that.

76
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,610
- Agent Scott.
- <i>Monsieur</i> Director, hello.

77
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:45,372
I see you are already making
yourself comfortable.

78
00:12:45,548 --> 00:12:49,040
Joseph Paquette and Emile Duval.
They're leading the investigation.

79
00:12:49,218 --> 00:12:52,449
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Thanks for inviting me.

80
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:54,213
We didn't.

81
00:12:55,157 --> 00:12:59,025
We're pretty sure the victim was killed
somewhere else, then brought here.

82
00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:02,461
I think it was premeditated.

83
00:13:02,631 --> 00:13:04,690
- What?
- I think it was premeditated.

84
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:09,895
I think the killer chose this site,
specifically, and dug it in advance.

85
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:13,672
I can show you... You can tell because...
See this? The corners?

86
00:13:13,843 --> 00:13:15,834
They're neat. They're symmetrical.

87
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:18,206
The proportions are precise.

88
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,780
They're exactly 5 foot, 11 inches.

89
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,612
- Your victim 5-10?
- Yes, exactly.

90
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,445
I think he's been watching him
for a few weeks...

91
00:13:27,623 --> 00:13:29,523
...studying his habits, his routine.

92
00:13:29,692 --> 00:13:32,718
And he knew he could rely
on digging the grave right here.

93
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,657
And how did he know the victim
would be here when he wanted?

94
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:40,233
That's a bicycle path, right?

95
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,427
On the photos you sent...

96
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:46,564
...the victim had these slight indentations
on his ankles.

97
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:49,743
I'm guessing that's from bicycle clips.

98
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:52,443
Also, there's a sexual element to all this.

99
00:13:52,615 --> 00:13:56,210
Strangling from behind, cutting off
the hands, smashing in the face.

100
00:13:56,385 --> 00:14:00,185
It's tactile. It's immediate.
It's what turns him on.

101
00:14:00,956 --> 00:14:02,651
And...

102
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:04,890
...he wanted you to find the body.

103
00:14:05,294 --> 00:14:06,818
I mean...

104
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:11,625
...why else bury it at a construction site,
unless you want it to be dug up, right?

105
00:14:58,581 --> 00:15:02,176
His eyes, we think they were removed,
or are they still in his skull?

106
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:04,410
- We don't know.
- I assume you're doing...

107
00:15:04,587 --> 00:15:07,078
Skull reconstruction. Yes, of course.

108
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:09,918
- It's being done right now.
- Okay.

109
00:15:10,192 --> 00:15:11,682
Are we done here?

110
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,122
- Yeah.
- Okay.

111
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,156
Good night.

112
00:15:15,564 --> 00:15:20,024
Don't worry about Paquette. He's impulsive.
He wants to rush into everything.

113
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:21,567
I don't blame him.

114
00:15:22,037 --> 00:15:24,005
It's good to see you again, Illeana.

115
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,471
Means a lot that you're up here.

116
00:15:26,642 --> 00:15:28,735
Lying in the grave.

117
00:15:29,244 --> 00:15:32,179
My investigators think
you are some kind of witch.

118
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,872
Well, I've been called worse.

119
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:36,643
- You know that.
- I know.

120
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,675
Hi. I'm sorry for disturbing you.
A man was killed last night.

121
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:15,644
It happened in a parking lot outside
a 24-hour health club around 9:00.

122
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:17,752
- Same m.o.?
- Same everything.

123
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,320
We found the garrotte there.
It looks homemade.

124
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:22,650
The face was bashed
in with a loose stone.

125
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:24,884
No time to get to the hands, though.

126
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,052
- Why not?
- He was interrupted.

127
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:32,030
The victim's name was Clive Morin,
and that's James Costa.

128
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:33,964
He claims he saw what happened.

129
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,127
He headed towards my car, and I hear...

130
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,433
When our guys got there,
he was trying to revive the victim.

131
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:41,075
What about the blood on you?

132
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:44,371
You try to help somebody
who's bleeding to death...

133
00:17:44,546 --> 00:17:46,980
- Is he checking out?
...you get blood on you.

134
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:51,047
James McKeen Costa.
Born Nova Scotia, 1965.

135
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,280
Everything looks pretty standard.

136
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,955
We've got blood samples
and a DNA swab on the way to the lab.

137
00:17:58,127 --> 00:18:00,891
I turn, and I see...

138
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,757
...a man standing over somebody else...

139
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:06,895
...with...

140
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,098
...a rock...

141
00:18:09,638 --> 00:18:11,435
...in his hand.

142
00:18:13,408 --> 00:18:14,932
And then...

143
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:19,809
...he started beating
this guy's face in...

144
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:23,615
- So I shouted...
- What did you shout?

145
00:18:25,754 --> 00:18:30,691
"Stop," you know. Something dumb
like that. I don't know. l...

146
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,453
And then I ran towards them.

147
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:39,400
And he looked up at me,
and he pointed a gun at me.

148
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:42,833
And I...

149
00:18:44,907 --> 00:18:46,704
I don't know. I thought...

150
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,275
I don't know what I thought.
Then he ran away.

151
00:18:49,444 --> 00:18:52,504
He's gone, and then I call the cops.

152
00:18:52,981 --> 00:18:58,112
And I tried to perform CPR on the
other guy until the paramedics came.

153
00:18:58,587 --> 00:19:00,817
Did you remove the garrotte?

154
00:19:00,989 --> 00:19:05,517
The...? Oh, the thing around his neck?
Yeah, I kind of had to.

155
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:10,657
- Did you see where the attacker went?
- Yeah, he went far from me. Right?

156
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,393
What kind of gun did he have?

157
00:19:14,336 --> 00:19:17,203
He had the kind that puts
really big holes in people.

158
00:19:20,475 --> 00:19:22,500
I saw this guy.

159
00:19:22,678 --> 00:19:25,772
All right? And I can draw a little bit,
all right? So...

160
00:19:25,948 --> 00:19:31,011
...maybe if you would give me a piece
of paper, I can sketch him for you.

161
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:40,527
I don't know about this guy.
I can't read him.

162
00:19:40,696 --> 00:19:42,857
Something about his answers.

163
00:19:43,532 --> 00:19:45,022
You mind if I give it a try?

164
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,391
No, please go ahead.

165
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:53,765
Hi.

166
00:20:03,752 --> 00:20:05,276
You another cop?

167
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,946
In a way, yes.
I'm Special Agent Illeana Scott.

168
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:14,020
- Special agent?
- I'm FBI. I'm helping on the case.

169
00:20:20,402 --> 00:20:23,337
- Can I ask a few questions?
- You asking the same ones...

170
00:20:23,505 --> 00:20:26,201
...the other guy did?
- Yes, probably.

171
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:30,303
- Do you mind if I have a cigarette?
- No, of course not.

172
00:20:50,532 --> 00:20:52,227
You nervous?

173
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:56,431
Yes, I am.

174
00:20:56,605 --> 00:20:58,334
Extremely.

175
00:20:59,074 --> 00:21:01,133
Thanks for the pad of paper.

176
00:21:12,154 --> 00:21:14,213
So, what did he look like?

177
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:18,916
He had extremely bright eyes.

178
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:21,122
Burning, you know?

179
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,491
Even in the dark.

180
00:21:23,665 --> 00:21:25,690
His hair...

181
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:28,469
...could have been blond.

182
00:21:33,642 --> 00:21:35,542
He had a beard.

183
00:21:36,111 --> 00:21:39,205
He had, not five-o'clock shadow...

184
00:21:39,514 --> 00:21:41,004
...but something cultivated.

185
00:21:46,855 --> 00:21:49,119
Did he seem agitated or in control?

186
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,993
Oh, Jesus.

187
00:21:53,161 --> 00:21:55,254
Is that what I think it is?

188
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,829
Is that...? That's the...

189
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:59,900
That was around his neck, right?
Am I right?

190
00:22:00,168 --> 00:22:01,635
- Am I right?
- Yes, yes.

191
00:22:01,803 --> 00:22:03,998
You did that on purpose?

192
00:22:04,172 --> 00:22:08,233
All right, I'm doing my best here, all right?
That man's face was half gone!

193
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,742
I couldn't even...
It didn't even look human.

194
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:14,575
I did everything I could
to try to help him, and he...

195
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,716
He died, okay? He died. There was...

196
00:22:20,155 --> 00:22:25,183
Look, there was too much blood there.
I'd never seen so much blood in my life.

197
00:22:25,861 --> 00:22:29,092
And I kept trying,
even though I knew that it was too late.

198
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:33,524
I saw the man who did this. Okay?

199
00:22:33,702 --> 00:22:37,661
I saw him, and I can show you
what he looks like.

200
00:22:38,974 --> 00:22:40,635
And then...

201
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:42,900
...you can go catch him.

202
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,673
Okay.

203
00:22:52,554 --> 00:22:53,919
What do you think?

204
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:57,547
Yeah, pattern marks on Morin's neck
show the killer's left-handed.

205
00:22:57,726 --> 00:23:01,492
He sketches with his right,
tried to light a cigarette with his right.

206
00:23:01,663 --> 00:23:03,927
I think we need
a little more than that, no?

207
00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:06,659
I know. There's also
a file open on the table.

208
00:23:06,835 --> 00:23:09,303
It's your profile.
Evidence, notes, everything.

209
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,872
If he were the killer, chances are
he'd be trying to take a look.

210
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:16,944
Psychopaths actually have
very different brain patterns.

211
00:23:17,112 --> 00:23:23,176
You say words like "tree," "sofa,"
"house," "rape," "incest," "murder"...

212
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:27,014
...a normal person's brain pattern changes,
their frontal lobe reacts.

213
00:23:27,189 --> 00:23:29,054
Psychopaths have no reaction.

214
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,627
They feel the same about murder
as they do about dinner.

215
00:23:32,794 --> 00:23:34,591
They have no emotional connection.

216
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:38,795
Anyway, my point is that
when he saw the garrotte...

217
00:23:38,967 --> 00:23:40,696
...he reacted...

218
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:43,633
...with genuine shock and disgust.

219
00:23:48,477 --> 00:23:50,809
A psychopath's brain?

220
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:55,506
You learn a lot of that stuff
at the FBI, don't you?

221
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,152
I mean, all those theories,
all those books.

222
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,083
Yeah, that's right.

223
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,455
I'm not sure what I see in you yet,
with your tricks.

224
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,019
- I don't have any.
- Bullshit.

225
00:24:09,397 --> 00:24:11,524
You pulled a lot of them in that room.

226
00:24:11,766 --> 00:24:13,131
Agent Scott?

227
00:24:14,002 --> 00:24:17,130
- Could I talk to you for a second?
- Excuse me.

228
00:24:20,742 --> 00:24:25,406
I have sisters who get that look in their eye
when they're cornered and don't like it.

229
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,048
- I'm sorry if I'm wrong, but...
- No.

230
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,776
- Thank you.
- All right.

231
00:25:20,969 --> 00:25:23,836
- Agent Scott.
- Can I talk to you?

232
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:30,910
- You haven't slept yet.
- No.

233
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,146
There's a guard
in the lobby of that hotel.

234
00:25:34,316 --> 00:25:37,285
And we're right by a road.
So it doesn't make any sense.

235
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,215
Do you think it was staged?

236
00:25:39,387 --> 00:25:41,947
No. There's always
a sense of joy in a staging.

237
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:45,058
A kind of arrogance.
There's none of that behavior here.

238
00:25:45,227 --> 00:25:49,220
Maybe he wants us to find the bodies
quickly, like at the construction site.

239
00:25:49,397 --> 00:25:52,855
Yeah. But why?

240
00:25:53,034 --> 00:25:55,662
I mean, why?
He's not taunting us.

241
00:25:55,837 --> 00:25:59,432
You know,
there's no "fuck you" anywhere.

242
00:26:16,691 --> 00:26:18,659
Why do you do that?

243
00:26:19,361 --> 00:26:21,226
- What?
- Cover your ears?

244
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:26,726
I just think better when it's quiet.

245
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:28,994
It makes sense.

246
00:26:36,144 --> 00:26:38,942
With all this,
maybe he's just getting desperate.

247
00:26:39,114 --> 00:26:42,777
- That happens, doesn't it?
- Yeah, but why?

248
00:26:42,951 --> 00:26:46,512
We're nowhere near him.
And he knows it.

249
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:01,764
Henri Bisonnette,
a freelance scuba diver.

250
00:27:01,936 --> 00:27:04,666
- Is that our construction site body?
- Yes.

251
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:07,205
His sister identified him.

252
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:11,641
Bisonnette used to work for him
on and off for a few years.

253
00:27:11,813 --> 00:27:15,510
Also, his sister said he disappeared
just about a couple of weeks ago.

254
00:27:15,817 --> 00:27:18,980
But his credit cards have been
in use all this time.

255
00:27:25,427 --> 00:27:27,987
What kind of a man was he?
What do we know?

256
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,660
He lived in a small apartment...

257
00:27:31,032 --> 00:27:33,694
...picked up odd computer jobs...

258
00:27:34,202 --> 00:27:36,170
...didn't have a lot of friends.

259
00:27:37,005 --> 00:27:38,905
You ever do that? Go diving?

260
00:27:39,641 --> 00:27:42,701
My ex-wife made us take
one of those Club Med holidays.

261
00:27:42,877 --> 00:27:46,369
She wasn't down 20 feet
before she freaked out. Couldn't take it.

262
00:27:56,024 --> 00:27:57,651
That's a good one.

263
00:28:01,463 --> 00:28:03,454
Have you ever gone diving,
Agent Scott?

264
00:28:07,068 --> 00:28:08,592
No, I've never tried it.

265
00:28:09,838 --> 00:28:11,567
It's very serene, right?

266
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,141
The fish swim all around you.
They don't even mind you're there.

267
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,809
You'd like it, it's quiet.

268
00:28:19,414 --> 00:28:21,575
- I've got a hit on that sketch.
- Where?

269
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,877
Some residential hotel near the river.

270
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:26,979
- What are you doing?
- Shouldn't we be going?

271
00:28:28,189 --> 00:28:30,521
We're still eating our breakfast.

272
00:28:46,374 --> 00:28:48,342
- Follow me.
- Thank you.

273
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:52,044
So he paid me cash three months
in advance, and I never see him.

274
00:28:52,213 --> 00:28:53,805
Did you see him here?

275
00:28:54,449 --> 00:28:56,349
Yeah, that's him.

276
00:28:56,518 --> 00:29:00,818
But before you guys bust him,
he kind of owes me $90 on the phone bill.

277
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,389
Maybe you guys can take care of that.

278
00:29:04,292 --> 00:29:07,853
You know what?
We need that phone bill.

279
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:12,463
- All right. You guys gonna pay it?
- We'll see.

280
00:32:08,376 --> 00:32:10,367
Everything's clear.

281
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,372
- Oh, shit.
- What?

282
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,028
The ring from the finger was engraved
with the name Clark William Edwards.

283
00:33:03,197 --> 00:33:05,165
It's from Vancouver Secondary School.

284
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:09,531
Thirty-four years old.
Works part-time on an Alaskan cruise line.

285
00:33:09,704 --> 00:33:12,696
His credit card was used yesterday
in Montreal.

286
00:33:12,874 --> 00:33:15,206
- He had not been reported missing.
- Good.

287
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:17,367
- Let's keep it that way.
- Why?

288
00:33:17,545 --> 00:33:19,706
Let's not reward the killer
with coverage.

289
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:21,872
He likes attention. He'll be pissed.

290
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:24,416
If he's pissed off, he'll make a mistake.

291
00:33:24,852 --> 00:33:29,585
We should put a marker on Edwards' credit
card and order surveillance of this place.

292
00:33:29,991 --> 00:33:32,516
- So we're getting close.
- One more thing.

293
00:33:32,694 --> 00:33:34,958
The lab results on Costa's DNA came in.

294
00:33:35,129 --> 00:33:38,223
- He's clean.
- Good.

295
00:34:38,226 --> 00:34:39,693
Man...

296
00:34:40,194 --> 00:34:42,719
You got those coffees and a sandwich?

297
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,561
So this isn't a coincidence, right?

298
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:53,172
No.

299
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:57,576
The two cops outside the gallery?
That's not a coincidence either, right?

300
00:34:57,745 --> 00:34:59,804
Does that bother you?

301
00:35:00,481 --> 00:35:04,440
I've been looking over my shoulder
since this whole thing happened, so no.

302
00:35:05,319 --> 00:35:08,846
- I'm glad for the company.
- How are you doing?

303
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:12,726
I can't sleep.

304
00:35:12,894 --> 00:35:14,555
But that's all right.

305
00:35:14,729 --> 00:35:17,562
I have a giant show on Friday,
bunch of new paintings.

306
00:35:17,732 --> 00:35:19,859
If I don't sell them,
I'm gonna go broke.

307
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:22,832
So I'm throwing myself into my work.
Kind of like you.

308
00:35:26,808 --> 00:35:28,435
- Here you go.
- Keep it. Thanks.

309
00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:32,170
Did you get any responses to the sketch?

310
00:35:33,614 --> 00:35:35,309
Maybe.

311
00:35:38,953 --> 00:35:40,545
You're being vague.

312
00:35:50,331 --> 00:35:53,596
That night, do you remember
Clive Morin fighting back?

313
00:35:59,106 --> 00:36:00,505
I mean, you know...

314
00:36:00,675 --> 00:36:05,942
...it took me a couple seconds to see,
even register, what was going on.

315
00:36:06,113 --> 00:36:08,513
I heard these sounds,
I saw him with the rock.

316
00:36:08,683 --> 00:36:12,210
By the time I saw Clive Morin...

317
00:36:12,386 --> 00:36:16,720
...you know, he wasn't doing anything.

318
00:36:20,161 --> 00:36:21,526
How do you know CPR?

319
00:36:22,797 --> 00:36:24,025
I don't.

320
00:36:24,198 --> 00:36:26,393
I mean, l...

321
00:36:26,567 --> 00:36:29,365
I tried to do CPR on him...

322
00:36:29,537 --> 00:36:32,267
...but I just did what I could, you know?

323
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,204
I imitated what I've seen on TV.

324
00:36:37,411 --> 00:36:40,107
You looking at my fingers?
You looking at this?

325
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,613
- Yes.
- You're, like, looking at everything.

326
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:47,152
No, this is... This is... l...
I make my own frames.

327
00:36:47,321 --> 00:36:49,812
You know, and I...

328
00:36:49,991 --> 00:36:53,552
The closer we get to the show,
the worse my accuracy is.

329
00:36:55,496 --> 00:36:59,398
How long have you been doing that,
dealing art?

330
00:36:59,934 --> 00:37:03,370
I started right after school.

331
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:08,173
I went to Thailand, you know?
And I...

332
00:37:08,342 --> 00:37:11,937
I met this very strange old man
who was a painter.

333
00:37:12,113 --> 00:37:14,911
But he didn't have any money
so he just...

334
00:37:15,082 --> 00:37:18,483
You know, he'd just paint everything.
And he had these doors.

335
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,121
These incredible doors that he'd painted.

336
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:23,382
And he gave me a couple of them.

337
00:37:23,557 --> 00:37:25,889
And so I brought them here
and I sold them...

338
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:30,224
...for, you know, not much money,
but I sent it back to him, the money.

339
00:37:30,398 --> 00:37:33,765
You know? And it was a fortune to him.

340
00:37:34,268 --> 00:37:37,760
And that's how I started.

341
00:37:39,573 --> 00:37:41,268
That's very nice.

342
00:37:43,911 --> 00:37:48,211
I'd like to buy you a cup of coffee,
but it looks like you have a problem.

343
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:52,247
Well, the first step is admitting to it.

344
00:37:53,321 --> 00:37:57,655
Is that a sense of humor?
Is that what that is? It is.

345
00:37:57,825 --> 00:38:00,350
All that and... What's this?

346
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,602
My cell phone number,
in case you remember anything else.

347
00:38:10,271 --> 00:38:12,603
Anything that might be helpful.

348
00:38:12,773 --> 00:38:14,673
Okay.

349
00:38:16,077 --> 00:38:18,068
All right. Well, thanks.

350
00:38:18,913 --> 00:38:21,575
Okay, I'll...

351
00:38:21,749 --> 00:38:24,411
Maybe you want to come
to the show on Friday night.

352
00:38:24,585 --> 00:38:28,487
You know, I think you'd like it.
Lots of strange, disturbing pieces.

353
00:38:29,957 --> 00:38:31,754
All right.

354
00:38:39,033 --> 00:38:42,196
Whoever was in that hotel room
called this number 20 times.

355
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:44,601
"Rebecca Asher."

356
00:38:44,772 --> 00:38:49,141
She claimed to have seen her dead son at
the Quebec ferry terminal three weeks ago.

357
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:54,748
- And what do we know about her?
- In her late 60s, no husband, lives alone.

358
00:39:00,321 --> 00:39:03,984
I'm gonna handle this one
on my own, I think. Okay?

359
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,266
I know you've seen this picture
on the news...

360
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:26,311
...but if you could take
a closer look at it, please?

361
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:30,179
Of course.

362
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,654
Could that be your son?

363
00:39:37,558 --> 00:39:39,116
It could be.

364
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,333
I recognized him on the ferry.

365
00:39:49,703 --> 00:39:52,968
He had a full beard,
hat low on his forehead.

366
00:39:53,841 --> 00:39:56,036
But his eyes...

367
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:58,178
...they were unmistakable.

368
00:40:00,514 --> 00:40:04,450
And he was pulling on his ear.

369
00:40:04,618 --> 00:40:07,382
It's an old nervous tic from childhood.

370
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:11,315
I could never get him to break it.

371
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:15,485
Were you ever actually asked
to identify a body years ago?

372
00:40:18,032 --> 00:40:20,432
They showed me some remains...

373
00:40:20,601 --> 00:40:23,502
...that had been hit by a truck.

374
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:29,803
I can't say that I was
in any way prepared for it.

375
00:40:29,977 --> 00:40:31,877
No, of course not.

376
00:40:32,046 --> 00:40:33,911
I'm sorry.

377
00:40:39,487 --> 00:40:41,887
- May I?
- Please.

378
00:40:50,097 --> 00:40:51,655
Martin.

379
00:40:51,832 --> 00:40:54,824
No. No, that is Reese.

380
00:40:55,002 --> 00:40:57,368
That's Martin's older brother.

381
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:01,106
By older, I mean three minutes.

382
00:41:01,275 --> 00:41:04,005
- Twins?
- Identical.

383
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:10,006
Has Reese been receiving
any strange phone calls, or...?

384
00:41:11,585 --> 00:41:13,985
Of course you couldn't know.

385
00:41:14,355 --> 00:41:15,617
Reese passed away.

386
00:41:17,191 --> 00:41:18,954
I'm sorry.

387
00:41:19,627 --> 00:41:21,595
They were 14.

388
00:41:21,762 --> 00:41:24,424
They took a raft out on the Saint Michel.

389
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:27,797
There had been a very big
snow melt-off that year...

390
00:41:27,968 --> 00:41:30,232
...and Martin fell overboard.

391
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:32,895
Reese jumped in to save him.

392
00:41:33,941 --> 00:41:36,466
Only Martin reached the shore.

393
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:41,245
- That must have been devastating for you.
- It was.

394
00:41:44,118 --> 00:41:46,211
Well, it was for Martin too.

395
00:41:47,521 --> 00:41:49,512
You know, Reese...

396
00:41:52,359 --> 00:41:54,259
He was just charismatic...

397
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,654
...outgoing.

398
00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:00,425
After he died,
Martin just took a strange turn.

399
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,501
He became violent.

400
00:42:03,537 --> 00:42:07,837
And when he was 16, he stole
most of my jewelry and ran away.

401
00:42:08,676 --> 00:42:11,975
The police from St. Jovite
called me just a few days later...

402
00:42:12,846 --> 00:42:14,780
...telling me about the accident.

403
00:42:17,084 --> 00:42:18,517
That's a great one.

404
00:42:18,686 --> 00:42:20,153
Oh, yes.

405
00:42:20,321 --> 00:42:23,449
Summer vacation, Fort Rupert.

406
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:24,852
And this?

407
00:42:25,025 --> 00:42:28,256
Oh, that was our first symphony.

408
00:42:28,562 --> 00:42:31,258
- <i>The Magic Flute</i>.
- Of course.

409
00:42:31,432 --> 00:42:32,660
He's cute.

410
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:34,698
He was.

411
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:38,595
He was cute.

412
00:42:43,711 --> 00:42:45,872
Now, that's Martin.

413
00:42:46,046 --> 00:42:48,810
He always had to wear those big glasses.

414
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:52,316
Half the time, I couldn't tell them apart
unless he had those on.

415
00:42:54,555 --> 00:42:56,386
Here, I'll just take...

416
00:42:56,757 --> 00:42:58,952
...that thing for you.

417
00:43:00,861 --> 00:43:04,661
- Oh, I forgot my purse. I'll just be...
- I'll get it.

418
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:24,542
Here you are.

419
00:43:24,718 --> 00:43:27,812
Thanks. I appreciate your time.
You've been very helpful.

420
00:43:28,756 --> 00:43:31,247
You will call me
when you find him, won't you?

421
00:43:31,425 --> 00:43:32,983
Yes, of course.

422
00:43:33,827 --> 00:43:35,658
Good.

423
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:44,469
So?

424
00:43:44,638 --> 00:43:46,936
How long does it take here
to dig up a body?

425
00:44:02,289 --> 00:44:06,919
According to his mother, Martin Asher
had only broken one bone in his life:

426
00:44:07,094 --> 00:44:10,894
The left radius,
falling off a chair or something.

427
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:14,228
This kid broke a lot of bones.

428
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:17,598
Mostly in his face, hands and torso.

429
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:23,437
But as you can see,
the left radius is intact.

430
00:44:23,944 --> 00:44:26,378
This isn't the body of Martin Asher.

431
00:44:28,115 --> 00:44:31,551
Okay. We better
get Mrs. Asher someplace safe.

432
00:44:33,687 --> 00:44:35,917
Here, Mrs. Asher, 601.

433
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,422
No, no. I'm afraid that room
is unacceptable.

434
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:40,321
It's too near the elevator.

435
00:44:40,494 --> 00:44:45,522
- How'd she talk you into putting her here?
- Mrs. Asher has a way with words.

436
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:47,962
She's hiding something.

437
00:44:48,135 --> 00:44:50,933
There's a door in the house
hidden by a bookcase.

438
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,630
Her house is under
the department's protection...

439
00:44:53,807 --> 00:44:55,832
...but we can't just go and search it.

440
00:44:56,009 --> 00:45:01,242
Well, what about a headstrong FBI agent
who's just not familiar with the rules?

441
00:45:01,415 --> 00:45:03,144
Now, that's a different story.

442
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:04,158
There you are.

443
00:48:59,986 --> 00:49:01,578
- Scott.
- <i>Illeana.</i>

444
00:49:01,754 --> 00:49:05,781
<i>The crime scene investigators think he came</i>
<i>in through a second story window.</i>

445
00:49:05,958 --> 00:49:08,085
<i>Mrs. Asher claims no one else has a key.</i>

446
00:49:08,261 --> 00:49:11,389
<i>And so far, the fingerprints</i>
<i>haven't turned up anything.</i>

447
00:49:11,564 --> 00:49:16,001
- <i>How are you feeling? You okay?</i>
- I'm fine.

448
00:49:16,169 --> 00:49:18,660
- <i>Are you sure?</i>
- I'm fine.

449
00:49:18,838 --> 00:49:22,069
<i>Illeana, Leclair knows</i>
<i>you were at the house.</i>

450
00:49:22,241 --> 00:49:25,301
<i>I don't think he connected you</i>
<i>with anything else...</i>

451
00:49:25,478 --> 00:49:29,175
Could...? Would you come to the office
about an hour early tomorrow?

452
00:49:29,348 --> 00:49:30,679
<i>Sure.</i>

453
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:32,681
- I'll see you there.
- <i>Bye.</i>

454
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:38,956
<i>Taking lives.</i>

455
00:49:39,125 --> 00:49:42,720
That's what Martin Asher's
been doing for almost 20 years.

456
00:49:42,895 --> 00:49:44,362
His first victim, John Doe.

457
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:47,397
He was clumsier then.
He covered with a car accident...

458
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:50,798
...to fake his own death,
and then he took the boy's identity.

459
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:53,837
There's a gap between
John Doe and Henri Bisonnette...

460
00:49:54,006 --> 00:49:56,372
...but that doesn't mean
Asher was dormant.

461
00:49:56,542 --> 00:50:00,603
Yes, ViCLAS gave us 19 unsolved murders
throughout eastern Canada.

462
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:02,611
At least 11 match the m.o.

463
00:50:02,782 --> 00:50:06,946
All who either lived solitary lives
or simply would not be missed right away.

464
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:10,611
Henri Bisonnette. Asher kills him,
takes his life, his apartment...

465
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:13,315
...uses his credit cards.
He even pays his taxes.

466
00:50:13,492 --> 00:50:17,519
Nothing extravagant.
He's just living Bisonnette's life.

467
00:50:17,697 --> 00:50:22,134
Then he drops him for Clark William
Edwards, and as Edwards he stalks Morin.

468
00:50:22,301 --> 00:50:25,896
All of these men have something in
common, something that he desires.

469
00:50:26,072 --> 00:50:29,337
Simply, a life different from his own.

470
00:50:29,675 --> 00:50:31,404
I met his mother.

471
00:50:31,577 --> 00:50:34,171
Asher had a twin brother
who she clearly favored.

472
00:50:34,347 --> 00:50:36,281
He died in a drowning accident.

473
00:50:36,449 --> 00:50:38,747
It wouldn't take much
to get her to admit...

474
00:50:38,918 --> 00:50:42,513
...that she thinks Martin had something
to do with it. She hates him.

475
00:50:42,688 --> 00:50:48,126
So this guy can't stand to be
who he actually is for even a moment.

476
00:50:48,494 --> 00:50:50,325
So...

477
00:50:50,496 --> 00:50:52,293
...he overlaps bodies.

478
00:50:53,065 --> 00:50:54,555
He's like a hermit crab.

479
00:50:54,734 --> 00:50:58,295
He outgrows one shell,
and he starts looking for a new one.

480
00:50:58,671 --> 00:51:00,263
Okay.

481
00:51:00,773 --> 00:51:03,241
Someone just broke
into James Costa's gallery.

482
00:51:03,509 --> 00:51:07,502
All that's missing is my organizer
and a business checkbook? Nothing else?

483
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,045
The alarm system was cut.

484
00:51:09,215 --> 00:51:13,174
Yeah, right. So this doesn't feel
like a normal break-in?

485
00:51:13,786 --> 00:51:15,845
What happened tonight, Mr. Costa?

486
00:51:16,022 --> 00:51:19,514
Right, listen,
I do all my calls to Europe at night.

487
00:51:19,692 --> 00:51:21,421
All my shipping stuff at night.

488
00:51:21,594 --> 00:51:24,825
I want a cup of coffee,
I go to the diner across the street.

489
00:51:24,997 --> 00:51:28,626
I come back in, the door's busted open,
and my desk is all messed up.

490
00:51:29,001 --> 00:51:30,491
You think it's him, right?

491
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:35,801
We're going to assign more officers to your
apartment until we're sure it's nothing.

492
00:51:35,975 --> 00:51:40,605
- That answers my question.
- Clark William Edwards.

493
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:44,811
You're meeting with someone named
Clark William Edwards tomorrow night?

494
00:51:44,984 --> 00:51:48,920
- Is that right?
- Yeah. He's a potential buyer.

495
00:51:50,723 --> 00:51:52,748
His rep called me up yesterday.

496
00:51:54,794 --> 00:51:56,455
Could be a really big client.

497
00:51:59,432 --> 00:52:00,694
You're kidding me.

498
00:52:02,001 --> 00:52:04,765
We'll have undercover officers
watching all the time.

499
00:52:04,937 --> 00:52:06,495
The best surveillance team.

500
00:52:06,672 --> 00:52:10,403
We're still talking about the same guy
who smashes in people's faces...

501
00:52:10,576 --> 00:52:12,271
...and cuts off their hands?

502
00:52:13,512 --> 00:52:16,504
He won't come within 50 yards
of you, okay?

503
00:52:16,682 --> 00:52:19,742
It would be a great service
to the city of Montreal.

504
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:26,050
It is a dangerous thing to do, but it is
probably our best shot at catching this guy.

505
00:52:30,196 --> 00:52:31,663
All right?

506
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:36,500
All right. All right.

507
00:52:36,669 --> 00:52:40,366
But only in service
to the great city of Montreal.

508
00:52:46,479 --> 00:52:48,276
Is he gonna drive me home?

509
00:52:48,447 --> 00:52:51,075
Could Agent Scott drive me home?

510
00:52:55,321 --> 00:52:58,222
I should have stayed
in Winnipeg, you know?

511
00:52:58,391 --> 00:53:02,589
I had a nice gallery, three paintings
on the wall, nobody ever came in.

512
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:07,256
If you stayed there, we wouldn't have had
a witness who could draw the killer.

513
00:53:07,433 --> 00:53:09,594
And that's made a big difference.

514
00:53:12,538 --> 00:53:15,234
- That's a generous way of looking at it.
- Left here?

515
00:53:15,408 --> 00:53:19,105
No, just keep going straight,
past Chevalier.

516
00:53:28,387 --> 00:53:30,821
Can I...?

517
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:32,981
Can I ask you a question?

518
00:53:33,659 --> 00:53:34,887
Yes.

519
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:36,891
How do you do it?

520
00:53:37,062 --> 00:53:40,725
How do you live your life
surrounded by all this...

521
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:44,563
...ugliness? You know,
I mean, murderers...

522
00:53:44,737 --> 00:53:47,069
...and victims and these pictures,
you know?

523
00:53:48,307 --> 00:53:52,368
What I'm going through, just a little bit,
is what you live every day, right?

524
00:53:52,545 --> 00:53:55,480
- This is my job.
- There are different jobs.

525
00:53:55,648 --> 00:53:59,516
- There are better jobs.
- Not for me. No there isn't. 219?

526
00:54:00,186 --> 00:54:02,518
219? Yeah, yeah, right up here.

527
00:54:03,756 --> 00:54:08,887
- You say that like it's a punishment.
- It's not a punishment.

528
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:12,093
It's more like a compulsion.

529
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:26,601
Okay, we're here.

530
00:54:27,213 --> 00:54:29,272
What compels you?

531
00:54:37,089 --> 00:54:39,114
What compels you?

532
00:54:43,762 --> 00:54:47,425
Fine. When I was 12 years old...

533
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,626
...I heard a noise downstairs
and I thought it was my dad.

534
00:54:50,803 --> 00:54:53,738
So... So I went down.

535
00:54:55,107 --> 00:54:57,803
And somebody had broken into
our house.

536
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:03,742
He saw me and he came towards me.
And I grabbed a knife and I ran towards him.

537
00:55:03,916 --> 00:55:05,747
And I killed him.

538
00:55:06,652 --> 00:55:10,645
He was 16 years old.
He was probably trying to steal the TV.

539
00:55:12,791 --> 00:55:14,759
But I killed him.

540
00:55:16,362 --> 00:55:17,795
That's what compels me.

541
00:55:23,769 --> 00:55:27,296
- Walk you to the door, Mr. Costa?
- Yeah, great. I'll...

542
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:41,009
What does Mr. Agent Scott
think about all this?

543
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,317
I'm not married.

544
00:55:43,489 --> 00:55:46,117
I just... I just wear that.

545
00:55:48,294 --> 00:55:50,694
So listen, tomorrow...

546
00:55:51,697 --> 00:55:53,631
It's gonna be okay.

547
00:55:53,799 --> 00:55:55,699
Try to get some sleep.

548
00:55:56,368 --> 00:55:59,201
Then I'll look forward
to seeing you tomorrow, okay?

549
00:56:14,219 --> 00:56:17,245
Is there some kind of signal
I should give if I need help?

550
00:56:17,423 --> 00:56:20,881
- You know, like...
- No need. All eyes will be on you.

551
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:24,359
We've got five men on the inside
and a dozen outside.

552
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:28,967
So don't worry. When he shows up,
we'll be right on top of him.

553
00:56:29,134 --> 00:56:31,034
Well, that's a comfort.

554
00:57:12,177 --> 00:57:13,508
Everything okay?

555
00:57:13,679 --> 00:57:16,307
- What?
- Would you like another?

556
00:57:16,482 --> 00:57:19,576
- Refill?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

557
00:57:19,752 --> 00:57:22,516
- Scotch, right?
- Yeah.

558
00:57:36,435 --> 00:57:37,868
He's late.

559
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:39,265
Yes, he is.

560
00:58:23,882 --> 00:58:27,249
I just got a note. It says,
"Meet me in the men's room."

561
00:59:02,187 --> 00:59:04,553
I'm going to the restroom.

562
00:59:39,258 --> 00:59:41,590
Meet me outside.

563
00:59:44,229 --> 00:59:45,457
What's going on?

564
00:59:45,631 --> 00:59:49,465
- We thought it best to cut it off.
- I was sitting in there for two hours.

565
00:59:49,635 --> 00:59:52,468
- He must've made us.
- "Made us"? What does that mean?

566
00:59:52,638 --> 00:59:56,472
He saw you? He knows what's happening?
Knows I'm cooperating with police?

567
00:59:56,642 --> 01:00:00,476
- Take it easy, okay?
- Take it easy? Have you ever been fishing?

568
01:00:00,646 --> 01:00:02,739
The bait always dies.

569
01:00:07,019 --> 01:00:08,680
Oh, boy.

570
01:00:12,791 --> 01:00:17,728
This ought to provide you
with some juicy profiling material.

571
01:00:17,896 --> 01:00:20,057
Single art dealer...

572
01:00:20,232 --> 01:00:25,033
...living in constant state
of organized chaos.

573
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:29,368
Purchases firearm, even though
he doesn't know how to use one...

574
01:00:29,541 --> 01:00:33,033
...for a false sense of security.

575
01:00:35,914 --> 01:00:39,543
- You... You can come in, you know.
- No, it's all right. Thank you.

576
01:00:40,719 --> 01:00:42,710
You two, back door.

577
01:00:44,189 --> 01:00:46,589
You'll be safe.
You have two guys in back...

578
01:00:46,758 --> 01:00:48,885
...and two in the hallway. Okay?
- Great.

579
01:00:54,766 --> 01:00:57,098
Just going to check the street
one more time.

580
01:00:57,269 --> 01:01:00,705
If you need anything, you know how
to get me, Duval or Paquette?

581
01:01:00,873 --> 01:01:03,433
- Yeah. Back there at the bar...
- It's okay.

582
01:01:03,609 --> 01:01:06,601
No, I really wish
I didn't freak out like that.

583
01:01:07,713 --> 01:01:10,045
I wasn't helping anybody.

584
01:01:10,549 --> 01:01:11,948
You've been great.

585
01:01:12,117 --> 01:01:14,608
You're making me sound nicer than I am.

586
01:01:14,987 --> 01:01:17,888
- You are nice.
- No. That's...

587
01:01:18,056 --> 01:01:19,717
That's the kiss of death.

588
01:01:19,892 --> 01:01:21,291
What do you mean?

589
01:01:22,628 --> 01:01:24,892
Us nice guys never get the girl.

590
01:01:33,238 --> 01:01:35,103
I should go.

591
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:36,901
You know how to find us.

592
01:01:49,488 --> 01:01:51,319
So I'm leaving.

593
01:01:52,157 --> 01:01:53,522
What do you mean?

594
01:01:53,692 --> 01:01:54,920
My job is done here.

595
01:01:55,093 --> 01:01:58,324
You have a profile and a witness.
You don't need me anymore.

596
01:01:58,497 --> 01:02:00,795
Illeana...

597
01:02:00,966 --> 01:02:03,491
...we need someone who can get
into Asher's head.

598
01:02:03,669 --> 01:02:07,127
- You have that, and you have a suspect.
- That might not be enough.

599
01:02:09,408 --> 01:02:11,137
What's really going on here?

600
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:13,039
Nothing.

601
01:02:13,578 --> 01:02:16,046
Please. What is it?

602
01:02:17,749 --> 01:02:20,912
I might be having a reaction
to the witness.

603
01:02:21,086 --> 01:02:23,020
A reaction?

604
01:02:23,822 --> 01:02:25,653
Favorable.

605
01:02:26,291 --> 01:02:28,691
One that could cloud my judgment.

606
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:30,623
I see.

607
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:35,197
Illeana...

608
01:02:35,367 --> 01:02:38,393
...how long did we know each other
when I was at Quantico?

609
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:40,538
- Six months.
- How many times...

610
01:02:40,706 --> 01:02:43,766
...were you asked for a drink?
- I don't know.

611
01:02:43,942 --> 01:02:45,910
How many times
did you turn them down?

612
01:02:46,078 --> 01:02:47,409
- Every time.
- Well...

613
01:02:47,579 --> 01:02:50,377
...I think it takes a lot
to cloud your judgment.

614
01:02:50,549 --> 01:02:55,111
Listen, I have to catch this guy.
I know you. You have to catch him too.

615
01:02:55,654 --> 01:02:57,519
I really need you.

616
01:02:58,991 --> 01:03:00,822
Please.

617
01:03:25,617 --> 01:03:27,881
At least the food is good.

618
01:03:28,687 --> 01:03:31,815
Yeah, because the art is shit.

619
01:03:33,358 --> 01:03:35,758
Try not to look so much like cops.

620
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:51,507
I almost didn't recognize you
without a picture of a dead body.

621
01:03:51,676 --> 01:03:54,668
- That's nice.
- It sounded better in my head.

622
01:03:54,846 --> 01:03:56,507
- Have a drink.
- No, thank you.

623
01:03:56,681 --> 01:03:58,740
I mean, it's just water.

624
01:03:59,117 --> 01:04:01,108
- All right?
- Thank you.

625
01:04:02,721 --> 01:04:06,122
- Excuse me.
- This one is my favorite.

626
01:04:06,291 --> 01:04:09,317
You know, it just...
I don't know why. The sky...

627
01:04:09,494 --> 01:04:12,622
The sky in it reminds me
of growing up in Nova Scotia.

628
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:16,196
Where'd you grow up?

629
01:04:16,368 --> 01:04:21,396
- Just outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
- Oh, yeah? You a country girl?

630
01:04:21,573 --> 01:04:24,098
- I'll let you get back to work.
- Thank you.

631
01:04:52,003 --> 01:04:53,436
It's him.

632
01:04:54,339 --> 01:04:56,000
Freeze!

633
01:06:32,304 --> 01:06:34,204
So now he's running loose again.

634
01:06:34,372 --> 01:06:37,170
We lost him in the crowd.
It was a fucking mob scene.

635
01:06:37,342 --> 01:06:39,970
"Fucking mob scene." And Costa?

636
01:06:40,145 --> 01:06:42,545
Shaken up, but he wasn't hurt.

637
01:06:43,381 --> 01:06:45,281
What do you think his next move is?

638
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:48,749
I think he sees James Costa
as unfinished business.

639
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:53,152
We've got Costa on a flight
to Toronto tomorrow morning at 8:30.

640
01:06:54,025 --> 01:06:57,256
Then I want one of you to take him
personally to the airport.

641
01:06:57,429 --> 01:06:58,657
Okay, I'll go.

642
01:06:58,830 --> 01:07:00,422
Dismissed.

643
01:07:08,406 --> 01:07:10,874
Oh, hey. Would you mind taking these?

644
01:07:11,543 --> 01:07:15,479
- We are running a little late.
- Yeah, I know. I know, I'm coming.

645
01:08:05,030 --> 01:08:07,191
Hi, James.

646
01:08:07,365 --> 01:08:08,662
Where you going?

647
01:08:17,409 --> 01:08:19,343
Not leaving, are you?

648
01:08:21,079 --> 01:08:24,378
Come on, after all these fun games
we've been playing?

649
01:08:24,749 --> 01:08:27,582
All this time that I've put into it?

650
01:08:29,354 --> 01:08:30,981
Take a seat.

651
01:08:34,693 --> 01:08:37,594
There's a police officer
outside your apartment.

652
01:08:38,229 --> 01:08:42,893
I also couldn't help but notice
that you've been packing.

653
01:08:46,271 --> 01:08:47,863
And that...

654
01:08:48,039 --> 01:08:49,768
...is not...

655
01:08:50,508 --> 01:08:51,736
...okay!

656
01:08:57,315 --> 01:09:00,546
Now, I thought you and I
had a special relationship.

657
01:09:01,486 --> 01:09:04,216
The kind that demanded
a great deal of respect.

658
01:09:04,389 --> 01:09:06,357
But obviously, you don't understand.

659
01:09:06,524 --> 01:09:08,549
So I'm gonna explain it to you again.

660
01:09:09,094 --> 01:09:12,928
You have something that I want.

661
01:09:13,098 --> 01:09:14,827
Therefore...

662
01:09:14,999 --> 01:09:17,126
...it's mine.

663
01:09:17,702 --> 01:09:19,897
So this idea of running away...

664
01:09:20,538 --> 01:09:21,869
...it's not gonna happen.

665
01:09:23,775 --> 01:09:25,936
I need you to answer something for me.

666
01:09:26,411 --> 01:09:29,039
What did you tell the police about me?

667
01:09:29,514 --> 01:09:31,209
What do the police know about...?

668
01:09:53,805 --> 01:09:55,033
Help!

669
01:09:55,206 --> 01:09:56,867
Help me!

670
01:09:57,041 --> 01:09:59,134
Help!

671
01:10:07,652 --> 01:10:09,347
Drop it.

672
01:10:11,656 --> 01:10:13,146
I said, drop it!

673
01:10:50,962 --> 01:10:54,693
This is Agent Scott.
Officer down, 219 St. Amelie.

674
01:10:58,803 --> 01:11:00,395
Shit.

675
01:12:44,275 --> 01:12:45,902
Help!

676
01:13:03,328 --> 01:13:04,556
Is he dead?

677
01:13:09,701 --> 01:13:12,363
Help! Is he dead?

678
01:13:12,837 --> 01:13:15,328
- He shot Duval.
- Drop your weapon!

679
01:13:15,506 --> 01:13:16,734
It's him?

680
01:13:16,908 --> 01:13:19,172
- Drop your weapon!
- It's him. It's Asher!

681
01:13:19,344 --> 01:13:21,471
- Drop your weapon!
- He shot Duval.

682
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,344
Move, move! Go!

683
01:13:56,948 --> 01:13:58,176
He was lucky.

684
01:13:58,549 --> 01:14:01,677
An accident like this, only stitches.

685
01:14:01,853 --> 01:14:04,378
Do you know where he was taking you,
Mr. Costa?

686
01:14:04,555 --> 01:14:05,783
I have no idea.

687
01:14:08,092 --> 01:14:11,220
I think he wanted to add Mr. Costa
to his collection.

688
01:14:13,197 --> 01:14:15,893
I'm so sorry about Inspector Duval.

689
01:14:16,334 --> 01:14:18,734
He was trying to save my life.

690
01:14:19,504 --> 01:14:22,496
- So, what now?
- We got our lab results.

691
01:14:22,774 --> 01:14:26,175
Asher's DNA matches the hairs
found on Clive Morin's body.

692
01:14:26,811 --> 01:14:28,904
So it's over?

693
01:14:29,881 --> 01:14:32,679
I will need a statement from you,
some paperwork.

694
01:14:33,151 --> 01:14:36,348
Other than that, yeah, it's over.

695
01:14:37,588 --> 01:14:41,354
You did a very brave thing
in that car today, Mr. Costa.

696
01:14:44,462 --> 01:14:46,293
You were great.

697
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:50,295
Thank you.

698
01:14:55,873 --> 01:14:57,272
Bye.

699
01:18:37,361 --> 01:18:40,091
- May I help you?
- Call Ms. Scott's room, please.

700
01:18:40,264 --> 01:18:41,663
Of course.

701
01:18:45,436 --> 01:18:48,030
I'm so sorry, sir.
She has a "do not disturb."

702
01:18:48,205 --> 01:18:50,070
Can I take a message for her?

703
01:18:50,241 --> 01:18:51,799
No.

704
01:19:55,439 --> 01:19:56,929
What?

705
01:19:59,410 --> 01:20:01,469
It's the stitches.

706
01:20:07,284 --> 01:20:09,980
Looks like you opened up some last night.

707
01:20:10,855 --> 01:20:13,255
I'll have to redo some of them.

708
01:20:21,932 --> 01:20:25,459
- They got art down there, don't they?
- What?

709
01:20:25,836 --> 01:20:27,963
Down there in Washington, D.C.

710
01:20:28,139 --> 01:20:32,371
Those politician types, they like to hang
things on their walls, don't they?

711
01:20:32,543 --> 01:20:35,171
I'm just saying, I could start a little...

712
01:20:35,479 --> 01:20:39,347
You know, a gallery.

713
01:20:39,850 --> 01:20:42,341
I could find a space there.

714
01:20:42,887 --> 01:20:45,219
They have galleries there, right?

715
01:20:47,291 --> 01:20:49,350
Oh, God.

716
01:20:53,164 --> 01:20:55,689
Where is it? Oh, my God.

717
01:20:57,768 --> 01:20:59,429
Scott.

718
01:21:00,271 --> 01:21:01,795
She's here?

719
01:21:01,972 --> 01:21:05,339
No. I'm in the hospital already.
I'm just here with a friend.

720
01:21:05,976 --> 01:21:10,003
- Be gentle.
- I'll be right up. Okay.

721
01:21:10,381 --> 01:21:11,814
That was Leclair.

722
01:21:12,683 --> 01:21:15,743
- I have to meet him upstairs.
- Sorry.

723
01:21:17,755 --> 01:21:20,417
Do you wanna come back here
or meet in the lobby?

724
01:21:21,859 --> 01:21:23,486
Lobby.

725
01:21:24,295 --> 01:21:25,728
All right.

726
01:21:32,770 --> 01:21:34,863
How's your friend?

727
01:21:35,039 --> 01:21:38,031
- He's fine.
- I know this is unpleasant for you...

728
01:21:38,209 --> 01:21:42,270
...but if you could just give us
a definitive identification.

729
01:21:42,446 --> 01:21:43,674
I understand.

730
01:21:51,188 --> 01:21:53,349
Can't touch the body.

731
01:21:54,325 --> 01:21:56,418
I'll touch anything I wish.

732
01:22:18,949 --> 01:22:20,746
Crazy old bat.

733
01:22:27,024 --> 01:22:28,252
Mrs. Asher?

734
01:22:28,425 --> 01:22:30,086
Mrs. Asher!

735
01:22:30,261 --> 01:22:32,024
Mrs. Asher?

736
01:22:34,865 --> 01:22:36,799
Hello, Mother.

737
01:23:00,324 --> 01:23:02,451
All I ever wanted...

738
01:23:04,528 --> 01:23:06,689
...was to love you.

739
01:23:08,065 --> 01:23:10,431
But you wouldn't let me.

740
01:23:11,302 --> 01:23:13,293
It was always Reese.

741
01:23:13,470 --> 01:23:17,372
You could have had me forever, but you...

742
01:23:18,809 --> 01:23:22,074
...ruined it. You ruined...

743
01:23:22,246 --> 01:23:23,804
...everything.

744
01:23:29,787 --> 01:23:32,051
Step back, Martin.

745
01:23:35,926 --> 01:23:38,087
You don't frighten me.

746
01:24:26,810 --> 01:24:28,744
Illeana!

747
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:31,443
Illeana!

748
01:24:34,418 --> 01:24:36,318
Costa did it.

749
01:24:36,587 --> 01:24:38,179
Costa did it.

750
01:24:39,056 --> 01:24:41,081
Costa is Asher.

751
01:24:41,258 --> 01:24:43,419
- What did you say?
- Oh, shit!

752
01:24:43,594 --> 01:24:45,653
- Costa did it.
- Where is he?

753
01:24:45,829 --> 01:24:47,057
- Where?
- Elevator.

754
01:24:47,231 --> 01:24:48,960
- Down? Up?
- Down!

755
01:24:49,133 --> 01:24:50,760
Which one?

756
01:24:57,508 --> 01:24:59,203
Fuck!

757
01:25:28,872 --> 01:25:30,806
Come on, for fuck's sakes.

758
01:25:44,355 --> 01:25:47,722
Hey, man. I found these in the machine.
Are they yours?

759
01:25:47,891 --> 01:25:50,291
- Yeah. Thanks, man.
- I was buying a pack...

760
01:25:59,236 --> 01:26:03,935
You don't trust us, but you did trust her
enough to come here and fuck our killer.

761
01:26:04,108 --> 01:26:07,475
Case was closed. She's handled herself
in a professional manner.

762
01:26:07,644 --> 01:26:09,111
Bullshit!

763
01:26:09,813 --> 01:26:12,805
Tell that to Duval. You remember Duval?

764
01:26:12,983 --> 01:26:15,747
And the poor bastard lying in the morgue?

765
01:26:17,755 --> 01:26:19,382
I know how you feel.

766
01:26:19,556 --> 01:26:21,820
If you have something to say,
say it to me.

767
01:26:21,992 --> 01:26:24,586
- What did you say?
- lf you have something to say...

768
01:26:25,729 --> 01:26:27,094
Paquette!

769
01:26:42,379 --> 01:26:45,439
For the past four years,
I've been scouting for the League.

770
01:26:45,616 --> 01:26:49,245
Quebec, Alberta, Manitoba, BC last year.

771
01:26:49,420 --> 01:26:51,820
Whenever I hear about some star kid.

772
01:26:51,989 --> 01:26:54,924
- Always traveling?
- You get used to it after a while.

773
01:26:55,092 --> 01:26:57,356
- Tough on the wife, though.
- Not married.

774
01:26:57,528 --> 01:27:01,862
No? So it's just you
and the two sisters, right?

775
01:27:02,032 --> 01:27:03,294
Susan and Debbie.

776
01:27:03,467 --> 01:27:05,799
And where are they?

777
01:27:05,969 --> 01:27:09,200
- They're back home in Tracadie.
- Tracadie.

778
01:27:09,373 --> 01:27:10,601
Hockey's big out there.

779
01:27:10,774 --> 01:27:13,675
Yeah, there's nothing else to do
in that fucking town.

780
01:27:13,844 --> 01:27:16,278
- You play as a kid?
- Yeah, a little.

781
01:27:16,447 --> 01:27:18,415
World Junior Team two years in a row.

782
01:27:18,582 --> 01:27:20,812
No shit. I could tell, I could tell.

783
01:27:20,984 --> 01:27:25,512
You got all that residual confidence
left over from being a golden boy.

784
01:27:25,689 --> 01:27:27,714
The way you smoke...

785
01:27:28,425 --> 01:27:30,086
...your voice...

786
01:27:30,294 --> 01:27:31,727
...it's a little low.

787
01:27:31,895 --> 01:27:36,093
Trying to be cool, so kids at the rink
don't know what a loser you've become.

788
01:27:36,867 --> 01:27:38,494
What the fuck you saying, man?

789
01:27:39,703 --> 01:27:41,364
Don't get tense.

790
01:27:46,543 --> 01:27:48,443
That's Christopher Hart.

791
01:27:48,612 --> 01:27:53,072
- What do we know about him?
- He's a drug addict and an art thief.

792
01:27:53,717 --> 01:27:55,947
Costa was selling stolen art for him.

793
01:27:56,119 --> 01:27:58,610
E-mails show Costa wasn't paying him.

794
01:27:58,956 --> 01:28:01,186
All Hart wanted was his money.

795
01:28:01,358 --> 01:28:04,293
He owed him over $80,000.

796
01:28:05,529 --> 01:28:07,326
Costa set him up.

797
01:28:07,531 --> 01:28:09,192
Yeah.

798
01:28:30,687 --> 01:28:33,247
<i>Hi. Are you there?</i>

799
01:28:35,526 --> 01:28:36,754
It's me.

800
01:28:38,128 --> 01:28:41,291
- Who is this?
- <i>You know who it is.</i>

801
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:44,633
Come on, Illeana.

802
01:28:45,035 --> 01:28:47,401
You didn't fall for James Costa.

803
01:28:47,571 --> 01:28:52,099
Somebody as beautiful
and powerful as you...

804
01:28:52,276 --> 01:28:54,642
...doesn't fall for a faggy art dealer.

805
01:28:54,811 --> 01:28:56,574
<i>Okay?</i>

806
01:28:56,747 --> 01:29:00,410
<i>That guy was nothing, all right?</i>
<i>I didn't take his life, I lived it.</i>

807
01:29:00,584 --> 01:29:03,314
<i>I was the best thing</i>
<i>that ever happened to that guy.</i>

808
01:29:03,587 --> 01:29:05,987
You looked at him...

809
01:29:06,156 --> 01:29:08,386
...and you saw me.

810
01:29:09,526 --> 01:29:12,893
And I looked at you, and I saw you.

811
01:29:13,363 --> 01:29:15,524
<i>And we are the same.</i>

812
01:29:16,133 --> 01:29:17,498
Fuck you.

813
01:29:17,668 --> 01:29:19,499
"Fuck you"?

814
01:29:20,003 --> 01:29:22,836
Fuck you. Yeah, I did fuck you.

815
01:29:23,006 --> 01:29:26,669
Remember making love with those pictures
of the dead people around us?

816
01:29:27,077 --> 01:29:29,136
<i>Let's face it, Illeana...</i>

817
01:29:29,313 --> 01:29:33,875
<i>... an ordinary person does not love that</i>
<i>as much as we did.</i>

818
01:29:34,051 --> 01:29:37,214
<i>I mean, coming inside of you</i>
<i>was the best moment of my life.</i>

819
01:29:37,387 --> 01:29:40,584
<i>And I feel so much better now.</i>

820
01:29:41,725 --> 01:29:46,025
Everything just keeps going my way,
you know?

821
01:29:46,229 --> 01:29:48,129
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

822
01:29:50,067 --> 01:29:51,500
- What'd he say?
- Where is he?

823
01:29:51,668 --> 01:29:54,398
A hit. Morin's credit card.
Bought a train ticket...

824
01:29:54,571 --> 01:29:57,301
...to Moncton 3 hours ago.
- He'll be there in 20 minutes.

825
01:29:57,474 --> 01:30:00,910
Get Commander Hache on the phone
and the Moncton director.

826
01:30:24,267 --> 01:30:26,098
I'll be fine.

827
01:30:26,403 --> 01:30:28,234
Thank you.

828
01:30:41,518 --> 01:30:44,954
<i>I want a cup of coffee,</i>
<i>I go to the diner across the street.</i>

829
01:30:45,122 --> 01:30:49,115
<i>I come back in, the door's busted open,</i>
<i>and my desk is all messed up.</i>

830
01:30:51,094 --> 01:30:53,654
<i>This isn't a coincidence, is it?</i>

831
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:03,867
Help!

832
01:31:54,157 --> 01:31:56,125
Police!

833
01:32:11,308 --> 01:32:13,868
Seal off all the exits.
Now, now! Do it now!

834
01:32:19,583 --> 01:32:21,016
You.

835
01:32:47,677 --> 01:32:51,738
<i>After carefully reviewing Special Agent</i>
<i>Scott's record with the Bureau...</i>

836
01:32:51,915 --> 01:32:56,511
<i>... the Office of Professional Responsibility</i>
<i>has issued a letter of termination...</i>

837
01:32:56,686 --> 01:32:59,348
<i>... citing egregious lack of judgment...</i>

838
01:32:59,523 --> 01:33:02,253
<i>... and conduct unbecoming</i>
<i>of a federal agent.</i>

839
01:33:02,425 --> 01:33:05,861
<i>Though the Bureau is saddened to lose</i>
<i>an agent of your caliber...</i>

840
01:33:06,129 --> 01:33:10,498
<i>... we're confident that this decision</i>
<i>will best serve all parties involved.</i>

<i>Clouds to 8000 feet.</i>
<i>Visibility, two miles.</i>

<i>Air temperature currently 10 degrees.</i>
<i>National weather forecast...</i>

845
01:34:05,789 --> 01:34:07,916
Sweetheart, you should
get yourself home.

846
01:34:09,893 --> 01:34:11,622
It's miserable out there.

847
01:34:14,431 --> 01:34:17,059
- Thanks. See you, Liz.
- See you.

848
01:34:19,035 --> 01:34:21,469
- You be careful, huh?
- I will.

849
01:36:45,315 --> 01:36:47,306
I scared you. I'm sorry.

850
01:36:47,484 --> 01:36:49,611
Come on, have a seat.

851
01:36:50,887 --> 01:36:53,788
No, no. Come on, have a seat.

852
01:36:56,126 --> 01:36:57,650
You were making some tea?

853
01:36:58,228 --> 01:37:00,526
All right, let me make you a cup.

854
01:37:06,636 --> 01:37:08,968
Are you...? What are you looking for?

855
01:37:12,075 --> 01:37:13,906
You looking...?

856
01:37:15,445 --> 01:37:16,673
You looking for this?

857
01:37:18,748 --> 01:37:22,081
Now, you see,
that's got me very confused, Illeana.

858
01:37:23,586 --> 01:37:27,488
I mean, you got these planted
all over the house.

859
01:37:29,325 --> 01:37:30,986
Got this one behind the fridge.

860
01:37:32,629 --> 01:37:34,722
You got one under the bed...

861
01:37:35,465 --> 01:37:37,763
...the underside of the bathtub.

862
01:37:38,935 --> 01:37:41,631
You must be awfully scared
out here on your own.

863
01:37:41,805 --> 01:37:43,500
Is that it?

864
01:37:43,706 --> 01:37:45,901
You feeling scared?

865
01:37:49,045 --> 01:37:53,675
I followed all that business
down there in Washington...

866
01:37:55,018 --> 01:37:56,679
...which, I thought...

867
01:37:57,220 --> 01:38:00,314
...was completely bogus, by the way.

868
01:38:01,057 --> 01:38:04,925
They were lucky to have you.
Very lucky.

869
01:38:05,462 --> 01:38:09,125
But then you just disappeared.

870
01:38:09,365 --> 01:38:11,458
You dropped out.

871
01:38:12,168 --> 01:38:15,660
You left a few footprints, though,
didn't you?

872
01:38:17,607 --> 01:38:20,235
I thought you were pretty easy to find.

873
01:38:21,611 --> 01:38:24,774
Come out here,
there's never any cops around.

874
01:38:25,381 --> 01:38:27,349
You don't make any phone calls.

875
01:38:27,517 --> 01:38:28,745
Here you go.

876
01:38:33,623 --> 01:38:35,716
Careful, it's still hot.

877
01:38:40,263 --> 01:38:43,994
And then I saw
that your belly was growing...

878
01:38:45,735 --> 01:38:48,568
...and I knew
that you were waiting for me.

879
01:38:51,107 --> 01:38:53,098
They're boys, aren't they?

880
01:38:53,276 --> 01:38:55,005
Twins?

881
01:39:06,422 --> 01:39:09,016
I like going into their room.

882
01:39:09,492 --> 01:39:12,723
It's full of so much love and warmth.

883
01:39:13,363 --> 01:39:14,591
I can...

884
01:39:16,032 --> 01:39:19,160
I can picture them in there, playing...

885
01:39:19,469 --> 01:39:21,562
...having fun.

886
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:25,633
You and I...

887
01:39:27,310 --> 01:39:28,971
...watching...

888
01:39:31,014 --> 01:39:32,538
...and laughing.

889
01:39:35,418 --> 01:39:37,079
You and I.

890
01:39:42,392 --> 01:39:44,792
We can start fresh.

891
01:39:49,599 --> 01:39:51,760
We can do this.

892
01:39:54,103 --> 01:39:56,731
What? What is it?

893
01:39:57,607 --> 01:39:59,199
I don't want to.

894
01:40:05,915 --> 01:40:08,110
I'm sorry. Those are our babies.

895
01:40:08,284 --> 01:40:10,684
- I know those are.
- These are not your babies.

896
01:40:10,853 --> 01:40:13,014
These are James Costa's babies.

897
01:40:13,189 --> 01:40:15,089
I don't know who you are.

898
01:40:24,801 --> 01:40:26,792
Why would you say something like that?

899
01:40:29,372 --> 01:40:31,704
Why would you say something like that?

900
01:40:32,675 --> 01:40:36,668
- Take it back.
- Okay, okay. I take it back. I take it back!

901
01:40:37,146 --> 01:40:38,841
All right.

902
01:40:39,249 --> 01:40:43,515
All right. Well, then stand up. Come on.

903
01:40:47,090 --> 01:40:48,557
Stand up.

904
01:40:59,402 --> 01:41:01,029
You okay?

905
01:41:04,607 --> 01:41:06,507
- Whose babies are they?
- Yours.

906
01:41:06,676 --> 01:41:08,405
They're mine?

907
01:41:10,780 --> 01:41:12,680
Give me a kiss.

908
01:41:39,876 --> 01:41:41,468
Kiss me.

909
01:41:45,648 --> 01:41:46,876
It's all right.

910
01:41:47,483 --> 01:41:51,078
I'm not gonna kill you.
I'm gonna do this until you pass out.

911
01:41:51,354 --> 01:41:56,087
You're probably getting light-headed
right about now. That's all right. Relax.

912
01:41:56,326 --> 01:41:57,884
It's okay.

913
01:42:02,498 --> 01:42:04,159
Okay. All right, come.

914
01:42:04,334 --> 01:42:05,562
Give those to me.

915
01:42:07,970 --> 01:42:10,097
It's all right. It's all right.

916
01:42:11,541 --> 01:42:13,270
Hey, calm down. Give it to me.

917
01:42:16,512 --> 01:42:18,912
Calm down.

918
01:42:19,949 --> 01:42:21,917
Give it to me. All right?

919
01:42:29,959 --> 01:42:32,052
What are you doing?

920
01:42:32,395 --> 01:42:33,623
What is wrong with you?

921
01:42:36,432 --> 01:42:37,922
Okay!

922
01:42:39,168 --> 01:42:42,467
You gonna calm down?
I'm not gonna hurt you, all right?

923
01:42:42,638 --> 01:42:44,868
I don't want to hurt you.

924
01:42:45,141 --> 01:42:48,338
- Are you gonna calm down?
- Yes! Yes. Yes.

925
01:43:17,306 --> 01:43:19,638
Everything you saw...

926
01:43:20,510 --> 01:43:22,137
...I wanted you to see.

927
01:43:31,754 --> 01:43:34,052
Fuck you.

928
01:44:21,537 --> 01:44:23,402
<i>Hello. Inspector Leclair.</i>

929
01:44:24,340 --> 01:44:28,037
- Leclair.
- <i>Illeana. I was worried.</i>

930
01:44:28,211 --> 01:44:30,008
<i>Is it done?</i>

931
01:44:30,546 --> 01:44:35,108
- It's over.
- <i>Good. Stay put. I'll call this is in.</i>

932
01:44:35,651 --> 01:44:37,710
<i>They'll be there soon.</i>

933
