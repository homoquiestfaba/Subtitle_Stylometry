Hey, look who's up.

22
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,512
Hey. What are we doing here, Nathan?

23
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:37,049
I think I took a wrong turn somewhere.

24
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,886
I'm just trying to get a signal
on for the GPS but nothing.

25
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,889
I know the way from here.
We should get going.

26
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,258
Okay, sure.
Whatever.

27
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,395
You had
a good sleep?

28
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,397

<i>(Nathan on phone) Sorry, I'm

<i>(Nathan on phone) just
call Agent Walker, okay?</i>

33
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:07,012
He's handling my cases

34
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,681
I thought you were
gonna turn that thing off.

35
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,683
It's off, it's off.

36
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,685
<i>(Nathan)
Look, I promise-</i>

37
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,855
This weekend is all about
me meeting your family.

38
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,025
No work, no phone.

39
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,027
<i>(Virginia)
No gun.</i>

40
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,863
I don't think my family are
going to be that intimidating.

<i>(Nathan) Wow, this place

44
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,906
<i>(Virginia) The perfect
place to forget our jobs.</i>

<i>(Nathan) Don't worry, my phone
doesn't want to work up here anyway.</i>

46
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,723
Wow!
Now that is a house.

47
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,727
<i>(Nathan) I didn't know I
was marrying into money.</i>

48
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,729
Don't get any ideas.

49
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,998
The house has been in the
family for generations.

50
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,000
It's amazing.

51
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,670
(Gran) Welcome home, Virginia.

52
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,672
(Gran laughing)

53
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,909
You're too skinny.

54
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,679
You say that every time
I've been away for a while.

55
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,681
Because it's true.

56
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,683
(Virginia) Jake! Look at you!

57
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,685

58
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,687
Where's Marcus?

59
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,022
(Gran) Uh, at work.
He'll be home tonight.

60
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,024
You guys I want you
to meet Nathan.

61
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,362
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

62
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,364
<i>(Nathan)
You must be Jake.</i>

63
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,533
Jake will help you
get your bag

64
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,802
show you to your room,
get you settled.

65
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,804
I don't mean to be an
ungracious hostess but

66
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,306
I'd like to spend some private
time with my granddaughter.

67
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,308
Understood.

68
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,415
(Jake) So you're the guy
who's banging my sister huh?

69
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,387
Well, if you knew anything
about your sister

70
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,389
you'd know it's
the other way around.

71
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,225
I heard you
call her 'Red'-

72
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,327
Everybody in the
family call her that?

73
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,329
Yeah, it's, uh, a name
of honor given to

74
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,832
the first born daughter in
each generation of our family.

75
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,334
So it's not because
of the red hair?

76
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,336
(Jake laughing)
No.

77
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,839
Well, what does
it mean?

78
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,209
You'll have to
ask Virginia.

79
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,017
It feels good
to be home.

80
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,019
So nice
to have you here.

81
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:30,222
Everyone sleeping under
the same roof again.

82
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,557
If only for
a little while.

83
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,197
How's that job?

84
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,367
Keeping my skills
sharp.

85
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,203
Any activity within
the den?

86
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,706
No they're
behaving quietly.

87
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,708
Adhering
to the truce.

88
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,043
That's good.

89
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,914
I need to talk
to you about something.

90
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:58,417
I wanted to wait until
we were face to face.

91
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,321
I want to tell Nathan
about our family history.

92
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,361
What we do is difficult for
people who were not born into it.

93
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:11,496
Just as difficult on
those who are.

94
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,999
It's a lot to trust
to someone.

95
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,668
I've never brought anyone
home for you to meet before.

96
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,340
It's important to me
that he knows me.

97
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,510
All of me.

98
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,546
I don't want to lie to him
for the rest of my life.

99
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,682
It'll have to be a
family decision.

100
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,351
Of course.

101
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,527
Virginia-

102
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,364
Are you sure
he's the one?

103
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,979
Well I'm so glad that we
finally get to meet you.

104
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:04,149
I was starting to think
you guys didn't exist.

105
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,018
I'd like to see my
granddaughter more often.

106
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,321
She just doesn't
want you to know

107
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,323
what we really do
out here.

108
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,496
Hey, remember, you're
talking to two Federal Agents.

109
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,532
So how did
you two meet?

110
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,534
Actually we met
at the academy.

111
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,837
I was sort of, I guess,
top dog for a little while-

112
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,908
<i>And your granddaughter
showed up and kicked my butt.</i>

113
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,010
No, I did not.

114
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,012
(Nathan) Yes, you did, Virginia.

115
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:36,014
That reminds me, um-

116
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,350
Why do you guys
call her Red?

117
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,952
<i>Yeah, why is that?</i>

118
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,288
(Gran) Why do you want
to marry my granddaughter?

119
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,957
<i>(Virginia) Let's not embarrass him.</i>

120
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,959
That's okay,
that's okay-

121
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,961
Um-

122
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,297
Well, I, uh-

123
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,299
I guess
she challenges me.

124
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,369
(Gran)
You like challenge.

125
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,971
I do.

126
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,973
Dude-
You have no idea.

127
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,480
<i>(Virginia) Okay, I think we
should unpack before dinner.</i>

128
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,982
(Nathan) I just have to run out
to the car quickly for something.

129
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:14,019
Thank you.

130
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,824
Play nice.

131
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,160
<i>(Virginia) Nathan, you
better not be on the phone!</i>

132
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,162
You have to keep
your mouth shut.

133
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:43,381
Oh, here we go-

134
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,359
Hey hey hey-

135
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,195
Ga- Ga- Ga-

136
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:59,197
Gabriel-

137
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,233
Hey! Hey!
Hey!

138
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,370
I'll go get help! Stay with
me and I'll be right back!

139
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,046
Help! Somebody call the police!

140
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:17,048
Hurry up!

141
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,388
(Nathan)
I don't understand.

142
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,390
<i>(Nathan) What the hell happened?</i>

143
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,392
<i>(Gran)
It's Xavier.</i>

144
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,695
<i>(Nathan) You know who this is?</i>

145
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:33,698
Yes, did he say anything
to you before you left him?

146
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,900
He said a name-
Gabriel.

147
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,404
<i>(Nathan) Am I the only
one bothered by the fact</i>

148
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,240
that I was just talking to
this guy five minutes ago?

149
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,242
And now he's
basically incinerated?

150
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,746
<i>It's physically impossible for
a human body to burn this fast.</i>

151
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,584
<i>(Nathan)
Finally.</i>

152
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,786
Sheriff-
Agent Keswick, FBI.

153
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,089
That's him?

154
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,859
Yes, Marcus.
This is Nathan.

155
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,861
Am I missing
something here?

156
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,863
<i>(Jake) This is our brother, Marcus.</i>

157
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,799
Jake, get a shovel and
a bag out of the truck.

158
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,801
Let's move this stuff
before anyone else sees.

159
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,803
<i>(Nathan) Whoa, whoa, hey
- There's protocol here.</i>

160
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,805
We gotta get
the medical examiner

161
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,807
to check this out first
before we touch anything.

162
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,076
Virginia, you brought him
here, you deal with him.

163
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,912
I am gonna have
to tell him.

164
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,914
We've been left
with no choice.

165
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,916
Tell me what?

166
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:26,918
Virginia, what the hell
is going on here?

167
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,920
I need to show you
something.

168
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,406
We have a problem.

169
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,576
Yes, we do.

170
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,748
(Virginia) I need you
to keep an open mind.

171
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,684
My family is not only
involved in law enforcement.

172
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,187
We are also hunters.
Of a sort.

173
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,023
Okay, so you hunt.
What the hell

174
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,025
does that have to do
with the dead guy outside?

175
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,027
It's what we hunt.

176
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,364
Okay, what am I
looking at?

177
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,368
It's what we hunt.

178
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,704
<i>(Nathan) But, but these are...</i>

179
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,708
Werewolves.

180
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,710
Oh, come on.
Gimmie a break.

181
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:31,382
Nathan!

182
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,384
I just need
some time.

183
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,386
Nathan!
Nathan!

184
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,388
Whoa whoa whoa-
Virginia, let him go.

185
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,390
No. Whoever killed
Xavier is still out there.

186
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,893
He's a big boy he can
take care of himself.

187
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,395
It's not a full moon,
he's gonna be fine.

188
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,531
Let's go. Come on
inside, come on inside.

189
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:50,568
Come on.
Let's go.

190
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,847
Come on...

191
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,527
(thunder crashes)

192
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:20,031
<i>(Nathan on phone)
Hello! </i>

193
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,033
<i>(Nathan on phone)
Hey, can you hear me?</i>

194
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,037
<i>(Nathan) This is Agent Nathan Keswick.</i>

195
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:28,373
<i>(Nathan on phone) Can you
hear anything I'm saying?</i>

196
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:32,410
Son of a bitch-

197
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,412
<i>(trees creaking)</i>

198
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:42,420
<i>(branches snapping)</i>

199
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,565
Anybody there?

200
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:10,849
<i>(Nathan)
Hello?</i>

201
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,354
(Nathan)
Somebody here?

202
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,699
Are you lost?

203
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:32,036
(Nathan) Who the hell are you?
And what are you doing out here?

204
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,372
(man) I was just out
here taking a stroll.

205
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,175
(Nathan) A stroll? In the rain?

206
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,177
<i>I prefer to be
out here in nature.</i>

207
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,048
Well, it's not safe. There's
a killer on the loose.

208
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,050
What kind of killer
would that be?

209
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,386
<i>(Nathan) I'm not sure.
Some kind of animal.</i>

210
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,889
Could it have been
a wolf?

211
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,157
What kind of wolf
would rip a man apart?

212
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,159
Something like this.

213
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,228
(snarling/growling)

214
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,230
(man screaming)

215
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:15,179
(werewolf growling)

216
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:35,433
(Nathan breathing
heavily)

217
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,603
(werewolf snarling)

218
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,309
(Nathan groaning)

219
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,055
My name is
Gabriel.

220
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,670
(Marcus) You going somewhere?

221
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,672
Nathan's been gone
too long.

222
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,674
We need to go
after him.

223
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:20,011
With Xavier dead I've got more important
things to worry about than your boyfriend.

224
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,013
Fine,
I'll go alone.

225
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,015
I'll send Jake.

226
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,017
<i>(distant howl)</i>

227
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:28,019
That's impossible.

228
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,355
It's not a Werewolf.
It's not a full moon.

229
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,523
<i>(Virginia)
I'll go ahead.</i>

230
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,128
<i>(Virginia) Jake, come on! Let's go!</i>

231
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,103
<i>(Jake) Nathan! Nathan!</i>

232
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,305
<i>(Virginia) Nathan!
Nathan, where are you?</i>

233
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,711
<i>(Virginia)
Nathan, answer me!</i>

234
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,854
(Jake)
Red, wait!

235
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,457
Nathan! Nathan, are you alright?

236
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,459
Nathan, get up!
Get up! Get up!

237
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,795
Are you hurt?
Nathan!

238
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:12,797
Answer me!
Are you hurt?

239
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,336
Everything you said
was true.

240
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,838
It was a werewolf.

241
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,840
Yeah. We followed his
trail directly to you.

242
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,344
You're lucky
to be alive.

243
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,346
He said his name
was Gabriel.

244
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,850
I watched him turn.

245
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,686
How did you get away
from him?

246
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,356
I don't think I did.

247
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,358
<i>(Virginia)
Did he bite you?</i>

248
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,360
No, I don't
think so.

249
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:45,696
I
- I'm sorry. I have to be sure you weren't bitten.

250
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:47,865
<i>(Nathan)
And if I was?</i>

251
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,867
You'll transform
and I'll have to kill you.

252
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,870
(Nathan groaning)

253
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,706
<i>(Virginia)
You're bleeding.</i>

254
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,708
What?
Did he bite me?

255
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,710
No,
no you're okay.

256
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,548
He's okay,
he just hit his head.

257
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,152
I'll radio Marcus. Tell
him we found Nathan,

258
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,322
and meet you back
at the house.

259
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,825
(Jake) I'm gonna see if
I can track this thing.

260
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,327
Be careful. We're dealing with
something we've never seen before.

261
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,330
(Virginia)
Here, let's go.

262
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,332
Okay.
Slow, slow-

263
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,334
Come on.
One, two, three-

264
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,337
Okay, I'm okay.
Okay.

265
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,339
(Virginia) You're
okay. Just take it slow.

266
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,343
What's wrong?

267
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,345
Hold on.

268
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,347
You okay?
Stay right here.

269
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,349
(Marcus) I was looking
for you what happened?

270
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,852
Nathan ran into a Werewolf
that can phase at will.

271
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,354
(Gran)
Is he bitten?

272
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,356
No, no,
thank God.

273
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,358
The Wolf's name
was Gabriel.

274
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,595
That must be the wolf
that killed Xavier.

275
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,730
Okay did he have any
special markings?

276
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,033
Did he have any
markings?

277
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,703
<i>I just watched a man
turn into a Werewolf.</i>

278
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:04,142
That may be a common day occurrence
for you people but not for me.

279
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,144
What the hell's going
on here Virginia?

280
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,313
The dead man, at the
end of the driveway?

281
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,150
He was the leader of one
of the last wolf packs.

282
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,152
Our family had a truce
with him.

283
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,487
As long as they stayed
in the deep woods,

284
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,823
<i>kept themselves locked
away during the full moon-</i>

285
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,326
We agreed not
to hunt them.

286
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,663
Okay, Nathan, what did he
look like in human form?

287
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,333
I don't know.
He's-

288
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,335
Middle aged,
six foot four-

289
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,671
Wait, wait, we're not
dragging him into this.

290
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,673
He's in this.
You brought him into it.

291
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:39,177
We have a dead pack leader and
a wolf who can phase at will.

292
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,212
(Virginia)
I won't allow it.

293
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:44,515
<i>You wanna marry this guy, you
want him to understand what you do,</i>

294
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:48,019
<i>then he needs to see it first
hand, see if he can stomach it.</i>

295
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,021
Let the man make up
his own mind!

296
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,925
The only thing that I
wanna make my mind up about

297
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,927
is going upstairs
and getting some sleep.

298
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:01,732
(Marcus) This is all insane.

299
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:13,211
I'm impressed that he survived a
werewolf in the first encounter.

300
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,379
Few people do that.

301
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:18,382
Maybe he is cut out to
be part of this family.

302
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:20,618
Or maybe somebody
wanted him to survive.

303
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:20,778
(slow breaths)

304
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:27,952
(Marcus)
Where's Nathan?

305
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,954
Still in bed.
Exhausted.

306
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,627
These perimeters are
clear. I think we should-

307
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,729
(Jake) Marcus! Virginia! I'm okay!

308
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,968
It took all night but
I tracked that wolf

309
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:45,970
just outside Tanner's
River before I lost it.

310
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,306
That town is outside
the designated territory.

311
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,508
Is the entire clan
is about to go rogue?

312
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,510
It's possible. But, if even one of them

313
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:55,346
set foot into the town, that's
a violation of the truce.

314
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,349
So?
We going hunting?

315
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,920
We are.

316
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,423
(Jake laughs)
Alright.

317
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,425
Hey.

318
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,427
That thing I saw
last night-

319
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:12,897
How do we kill it?

320
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,601
<i>(Virginia) There's only
one way to kill a werewolf.</i>

321
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,604
<i>(Virginia) A silver
weapon through the heart,</i>

322
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,606
bullet or blade,
doesn't matter.

323
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,608
It's an involuntary
transformation

324
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,944
triggered by the full
moon it ends at dawn.

325
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:29,280
This Gabriel seems like a
different kind of animal.

326
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,283
<i>You get bitten by a
werewolf, you will</i>

327
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,785
turn into one of them
by the next full moon.

328
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:37,288
<i>(Jake) There's a chance that
the effects can be reversed</i>

329
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,957
but only if you kill
the wolf that bit you

330
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:41,959
before you make
your first human kill.

331
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,962
You kill a human, you're
cursed for as long as you live.

332
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,131
So basically,
don't get bitten.

333
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,567
Once you're bitten,
you're never the same.

334
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:52,069
It's like a disease or drug
addiction you can't kick.

335
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,238
The wolf is always
a part of you.

336
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:58,576
You ever turn
one back?

337
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,579
A werewolf,
I mean.

338
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:03,748
Grandmother did.
Once.

339
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,083
Who was it?

340
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:08,085
Our grandfather.

341
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,087
Our family's dirty
little secret.

342
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:15,760
If we're hunting during the day
how do we know they're not wolves?

343
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:18,262
(Marcus) They may not look
like wolves but they are.

344
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:20,765
<i>How do we make sure
we don't kill a human?</i>

345
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,934
A werewolf test.

346
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,270
UGH!

347
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,272
It's a pellet filled
with silver halide paint,

348
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:31,275
burns the flesh, marks them and
causes a mild transformation.

349
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:34,111
Mild transformation?
What does that mean?

350
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:37,782
You'll see.

351
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:39,984
God!

352
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:43,621
Okay, okay,
alright!

353
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,230
<i>(Virginia) Tanner's River is
the edge of their territory.</i>

354
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:56,434
<i>(Marcus) Anyone from the pack
caught within the town is fair game.</i>

355
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:58,736
<i>(Jake) And fair game means dead.</i>

356
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,596
What the hell
happened here?

357
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,765
It was before
the truce.

358
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,801
It was a course of 3 nights
practically everyone here was turned.

359
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,637
My family had no choice
but to put them down.

360
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:36,273
An entire town?

361
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,275
That's why it's so
important that we

362
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,110
never let them out
of their territory.

363
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,613
Never let them get close
to the rest of civilization.

364
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,451
Truce or no truce.

365
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,987
We should have wiped
them out a long time ago.

366
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,556
<i>(tires screeching)</i>

367
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:58,529
(footsteps)

368
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,232
Go go go go go!

369
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:15,412
<i>(Marcus) Looks like we
got a couple of rogues.</i>

370
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,414
<i>(Marcus)
Shooter in position?</i>

371
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,416
(Nathan)
Affirmative.

372
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,419
<i>Nathan, you see your wolf from
last night you let us know.</i>

373
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:38,602
(shot firing)

374
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:40,604
(wolf growling)

375
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:45,442
(blade slicing)

376
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,051
(groaning)

377
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:56,053
(wolf growling)

378
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,055
(shot firing)

379
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,057
(shot firing)

380
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:02,059
(shots firing)

381
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:08,732
I love this.

382
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,705
(gun shots firing)

383
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:18,475
(shot firing)

384
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,511
(shot firing)

385
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:22,513
<i>(Gabriel)
Nathan...</i>

386
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:26,650
What are you
doing?

387
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,653
(shots firing)

388
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:34,258
¶

389
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:36,260
You alright?

390
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:38,262
Yeah, thanks
to Nathan.

391
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:40,264
I'm good.

392
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,936
Is this your wolf?

393
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:47,972
No.

394
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,945
(shots firing)

395
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:56,947
(werewolf screeches)

396
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:04,755
(sounds from trunk)

397
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,576
(girl screams)

398
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,578
Please,
don't hurt me!

399
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,747
Grab her.

400
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,916
Come on.
Come on.

401
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,252
(Virginia) It's okay,
it's okay. You're safe now.

402
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,423
(Virginia)
Did they hurt you?

403
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,093
It's okay,
it's okay.

404
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,596
Just tell us
what happened.

405
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:48,599
I was running out of gas
and I pulled off the highway.

406
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:52,202
And there was
a gas station.

407
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:54,872
And there was just
dead ends-

408
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:00,377
That's where
they put me.

409
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,379
(girl sobbing)

410
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,885
You and Virginia take
her to the hospital.

411
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:10,387
Tell them we'll be by
later to file a report.

412
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,389
Virginia will know
what to say.

413
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,391
Okay where are you
gonna go?

414
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:17,394
We'll sweep the rest of the town,
make sure there's nothing else.

415
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,396
Jake!
Let's go.

416
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:22,900
Is she okay?

417
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,736
Are you sure
they didn't hurt you?

418
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:30,908
They said they were gonna
use me In the next game.

419
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:35,079
What game?

420
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,247
I don't know.

421
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:39,249
From what they
were saying.

422
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:42,252
Once you go to the game,
you never come back.

423
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:46,256
(girl crying)

424
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,534
(people groaning)

425
00:28:57,602 --> 00:29:03,540
(people crying)

426
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,055
Come on!

427
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:24,428
(girls crying)

428
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:26,430
Come on!

429
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:38,609
(footsteps)

430
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:05,536
Your ancestors
were strong.

431
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:10,440
Their blood is
in your veins.

432
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:15,112
<i>They were
unstoppable.</i>

433
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:18,982
<i>Your ancestors roamed
free on this earth.</i>

434
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:24,388
But now the hunters
define us.

435
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,791
They've driven us to
this rotten little patch.

436
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:07,097
They say we're
ruled by the moon!

437
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,000
I say it's
all a lie!

438
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,138
We can change at will.

439
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:18,442
(people crying)

440
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:20,444
(bones cracking)

441
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:24,715
(people crying)

442
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:28,886
(bones cracking)

443
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:33,924
(people gasping)

444
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,355
No one here,
but us humans.

445
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:13,690
So it would seem.

446
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:23,000
Do you see the way
they look at you?

447
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:28,972
You should have killed
Xavier much sooner.

448
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,010
To survive
we must evolve.

449
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:59,403
(Nathan)
Hey.

450
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:03,840
You okay?

451
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:06,410
Thank you.

452
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,412
For what?

453
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,414
For keeping our secret.
Not saying anything

454
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:12,416
to that girl's parents
at the hospital.

455
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:15,419
Well, it's all about
family right?

456
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:22,793
I'm not sure my family's
been the best thing for you.

457
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:29,433
Is there a reason that you
never talk about your parents?

458
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:33,437
I didn't really
know them.

459
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:35,439
I was so young
when they died.

460
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:37,607
How did they die?

461
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:40,243
Killed by a Werewolf.

462
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,380
I'm sorry.

463
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:48,218
What's bothering you?

464
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,253
Nothing, I'm fine.

465
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,495
I liked killing that
Werewolf today.

466
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,799
I enjoyed it.

467
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,236
I felt no sense of
remorse whatsoever.

468
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,041
Made me feel
powerful.

469
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:15,145
Is that wrong?

470
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:19,116
No.

471
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,268
(girl crying)

472
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:14,371
Tonight you'll learn
what it's like.

473
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:16,840
To be like us.

474
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:20,177
To live in
a primal state.

475
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,614
If you will it,
you will survive.

476
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:30,387
Set 'em free.

477
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:50,373
I want you
to turn me.

478
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,375
I don't wanna die.

479
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,377
I wanna live.

480
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,414
I wanna be like you.

481
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:05,789
(growls)

482
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,492
(screams)

483
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:42,292
(truck engine)

484
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,644
(growl)

485
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:26,469
(screams)

486
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,406
Just relax. I'll end
this quickly for you.

487
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:34,978
(deep growling)

488
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:37,180
AHHHHHHHH!

489
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:40,016
(werewolf snarling)

490
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:42,619
AHHHHHHH!

491
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:03,239
Don't move, don't move! Stay calm!

492
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:05,375
Don't kill me,
don't kill me!

493
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:07,377
Don't kill me,
don't kill me!

494
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:09,379
It's okay!

495
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,381
It's okay, believe me.
You're safe with us.

496
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:14,050
No, we have to go! The
wolves, they're coming!

497
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:16,886
They're coming!

498
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:18,888
<i>(Virginia)
It's okay-</i>

499
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,890
Is this the game we've
been hearing about?

500
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,892
The game?
They hunt humans?

501
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,894
Yes!

502
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:31,368
(gun shot fires)

503
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,149
(wolf dies)

504
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:58,061
How did you know that
wolf was there?

505
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,834
Instinct, I guess.

506
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:24,954
Okay there's no record here of any
wolf being able to transform at will.

507
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:26,956
Nothing.

508
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:28,958
So is this Gabriel some
kind of new breed?

509
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,294
Being able to transform at
will, it changes everything.

510
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:35,465
Especially if he's teaching the
rest of his pack to do the same.

511
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:38,301
The guy at the farmhouse
he's been with them for weeks.

512
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:40,236
He said this wolf
is also telepathic.

513
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:43,239
He said that Gabriel can somehow
communicate with those he's turned.

514
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,075
Is that even possible?

515
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,077
I dunno, Red.

516
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,080
I'm seeing things that I never
thought I'd see in my lifetime.

517
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,082
We have to wipe
them out now.

518
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,084
Every last one
of them.

519
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,086
No more excuse,
no more truce.

520
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,088
No more mercy.

521
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:02,091
You guys go upstairs
get some rest.

522
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,594
First thing in the morning
we start at Tanner's River,

523
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:08,264
work our way to the farmhouse,
see if we can pick up the trail.

524
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,769
Gran-

525
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,440
There's something about
Nathan that bothers me.

526
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:19,776
What?

527
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,778
I dunno, it's just
a feeling I get.

528
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,780
Keep an eye on him.

529
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:14,264
<i>(Virginia) Nothing up here to report!</i>

530
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:16,432
I can't see anything
out here either!

531
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,435
We've been looking all day
we must have missed something.

532
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:22,205
<i>(Virginia) I think we should
lock up here for the night.</i>

533
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:24,207
Maybe wait 'til
the full moon.

534
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,444
Check that.

535
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,662
(heavy breathing/
struggling)

536
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,388
Nathan?

537
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,229
(growls)

538
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:56,699
Nathan?

539
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:00,703
(Nathan growls)

540
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,745
<i>(Marcus)
Virginia, move!</i>

541
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:10,747
Don't kill him!

542
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:16,419
(Nathan growls)

543
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,421
(Nathan growling)

544
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,423
Hit him before
he moves!

545
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:22,425
(taser tasing)

546
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,974
You put us all
in danger.

547
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:41,344
(Marcus) We need to lock him up.

548
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:50,613
What happened?

549
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:56,652
You've been infected,
Nathan.

550
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:06,129
Last night you turned
into a Werewolf.

551
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,531
Did I hurt anyone?

552
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:10,533
No, no,
thank God.

553
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,706
How did this
happen?

554
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,709
Gabriel must have
bitten you.

555
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:21,711
I should have looked
more closely.

556
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:27,116
You said-

557
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:30,653
You said that if I
turned into a Werewolf,

558
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:34,757
you were gonna have to kill me.

559
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,669
Wait here.

560
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,671
I'll get you some
clothes.

561
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:21,337
You shoulda let me kill
him.

562
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:25,208
Not everything is black
and white, Marcus!

563
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,210
It is to me!

564
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:29,145
That's always been
your problem.

565
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:31,647
If you could see anything
outside of being a hunter.

566
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,317
I don't wanna see anything
outside of being a hunter!

567
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:38,154
This is what I am! I'm good
at it! I like being good at it!

568
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,489
Your narrow view of the
world is a liability.

569
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:43,492
No, I'm not the bad guy here,
you're the one who's wrong.

570
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,494
First responsibility is
always to protect this family.

571
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:47,997
Always. You shouldn't
have brought him here.

572
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,800
Nathan is family!
As far as I'm concerned!

573
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:54,971
Forgive me for wanting to have some
kind of life outside of being a hunter!

574
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:58,207
Marcus if it had been
Jake, Virginia, or me,

575
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:00,443
would you have been
able to kill so easily?

576
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:03,212
We all make mistakes,
Marcus.

577
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:05,348
No one got hurt that's
the impotant thing.

578
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,350
It is time to forgive
and move on.

579
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,852
We have to stick together
now more than ever before.

580
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,854
We know who
infected him, right?

581
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,856
He hasn't killed
anyone.

582
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,858
What's the problem?
We can turn him back.

583
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,694
We gotta hunt Gabriel to
the ends of the earth anyway.

584
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,696
It's not that simple,
there are repercussions.

585
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,698
They're manageable.

586
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,668
It's not gonna turn out
well for you and him.

587
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:28,471
Then, it'll be my problem
to deal with.

588
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:30,473
After we turn him back.
Not yours.

589
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:34,110
I got him into this
I'm gonna get him out.

590
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:36,245
With or without your
help, Marcus.

591
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,414
(Marcus)
I'll help!

592
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:41,384
I'll help.

593
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:45,655
(Marcus) But it's only
because I wanna hunt that son

594
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:47,657
of a bitch down
and kill him myself.

595
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:50,660
For the record, if that
happen to me, I want

596
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:53,996
one of you to kill me rather
than let me live like that.

597
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:56,332
I'll make a note of it
for future reference.

598
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,685
(Gabriel) That's it. You can do it.

599
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,754
Yes, you can.

600
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,061
There is a beast
in all of us.

601
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,264
<i>(Gabriel) Just waiting to be summoned.</i>

602
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:31,500
Feel it coursing
through your veins.

603
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:33,636
You've got to
give into it.

604
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:36,672
<i>(Gabriel) Get rid of
that painful human side.</i>

605
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,944
It's just too hard.

606
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:47,283
Really?

607
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,585
Perhaps you should
lie down. Take a nap.

608
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:53,789
<i>I'd like that.</i>

609
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,791
Sleep tight.

610
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,260
(screams)

611
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:05,401
So-

612
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:07,403
Shall we try again?

613
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:14,110
You know it's an amazing feeling when
you are in the throws of transformation.

614
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:20,816
It is such joy.

615
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:23,686
Such ecstasy.

616
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:28,090
And to think that you can have
that sensation whenever you want it.

617
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:30,893
That's what you desire.

618
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,462
That's what you thirst
for.

619
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:36,165
Now let that desire
drive you.

620
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:48,210
(breaths and growls)

621
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:54,050
Well done.

622
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:58,187
Well if he can do it,
who's next?

623
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:20,209
Hey.

624
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:22,578
How's he doing?

625
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:24,580
Nathan?

626
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,016
He's strong.

627
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:31,220
He's a good man.

628
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:35,558
Yeah.
He is.

629
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:40,196
Any activity?

630
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:42,198
It's all quiet.

631
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,534
I plotted out their movements
over the last 3 days.

632
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,038
Given what the guy
at the farmhouse said,

633
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:51,540
they must still be hiding
out in Tanner's River.

634
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,376
<i>I wish he could have
given us more information.</i>

635
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:57,213
He was hysterical. It must
have been like a bad dream.

636
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:59,215
Ah this is
a bad dream.

637
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,454
Do you agree with Marcus? About Nathan?

638
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,229
I don't know, Red.

639
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,732
I just want
all this to be over.

640
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:18,734
Hey.

641
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:20,736
So, is it time?

642
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:22,738
It is.

643
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,907
The wolf stays here.

644
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:46,855
The license plates, we
should have noticed before.

645
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:49,358
Notice what?

646
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,493
<i>(Marcus) They're all out of state.</i>

647
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:55,464
<i>By the look of it they've been louring
people off the highway for quite a while.</i>

648
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:58,434
<i>(distant sound)</i>

649
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,004
Go go, go!

650
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,100
1, 2... go!

651
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:41,236
This should make you
sleep right through it.

652
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,772
It's for the best believe me.

653
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:46,241
Okay.

654
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,618
Thank you.

655
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,954
Thank you for being so
concerned for my safety.

656
00:55:59,989 --> 00:56:01,924
It's not for your safety,
it's for my own.

657
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,130
Is it true?

658
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:11,467
That you were able to turn your
husband back after he got infected?

659
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,137
It's true.

660
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,274
Was it the right choice?

661
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:23,846
That's a difficult
question, Nathan.

662
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,816
Please.

663
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:30,719
I would really like
to know the answer.

664
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,324
He liked being a wolf.

665
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:39,261
He resented that I took
the choice away from him.

666
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:43,432
On more than one occasion I found
him trying to turn himself back.

667
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,026
Eventually he did.

668
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:13,462
And so I had to kill him.

669
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:19,301
I'm sorry for what
happened to you.

670
00:57:21,037 --> 00:57:23,806
I know that you are a
victim in all of this.

671
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:27,142
But I will not let my granddaughter
go through what I had to.

672
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:31,413
Not if I can help it.

673
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:16,225
You and jake head down
that way, I'll go down here.

674
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:18,560
Splitting up's not
such a good idea.

675
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:20,496
Make sure none
of them get past us.

676
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:22,498
I'll be fine.

677
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:02,905
What is this?

678
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:34,469
Welcome.

679
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:37,005
I've been looking
forward to this.

680
00:59:37,707 --> 00:59:39,641
<i>(Gabriel)
Get some rest.</i>

681
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:50,586
Nathan!

682
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:07,169
(Nathan growls)

683
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:09,171
(Virginia screams)

684
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:22,217
(Virginia struggling)

685
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:26,221
(Virginia crying)

686
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:34,296
Gabriel, I presume?

687
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:38,867
After I've had a bad
dream,

688
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:42,537
I find it's helpful to
get a good stretch.

689
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:46,541
Where are my brothers?

690
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,412
Worrying about their
future, I hope.

691
01:00:54,717 --> 01:00:56,985
Our newbies are eager to
make their first kill.

692
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,590
And me?

693
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:08,196
I intend to
kill you myself.

694
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:13,969
The last female warrior
of the hunter blood line.

695
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:22,711
You're a monster.
You and all your kind.

696
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:28,984
Now
- We're the perfect match.

697
01:01:45,234 --> 01:01:47,169
I am going to kill you,
Gabriel.

698
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:55,010
Once upon a time
I would have run.

699
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:26,875
(distant growl)

700
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,846
Jake, Jake!

701
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:37,252
(Gabriel screaming)

702
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:43,325
Hunters, we honor you.

703
01:02:45,294 --> 01:02:47,562
For our newcomers, you will
be their first kills.

704
01:02:48,998 --> 01:02:52,167
You will give them the opportunity
to show what they're made of.

705
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:57,339
The chance to become
permanent members of the clan.

706
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:01,810
Set them free!

707
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:04,146
Jake!

708
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:06,148
Jake we've got to
stick together!

709
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:08,150
Always!

710
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:24,099
We gotta find someplace
to make a stand.

711
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,101
We're never going to
out run them.

712
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:28,103
Find a weapon
or something!

713
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:30,939
Marcus!

714
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:37,612
They never checked
my boots.

715
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:42,784
Our odds of survival just
improved dramatically, let's go.

716
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,755
<i>(Marcus) Come on, Jake! Come on!</i>

717
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:00,135
(Marcus)
Come on!

718
01:04:11,547 --> 01:04:13,481
Where'd they go?

719
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,483
I don't know.
Jake, go back-

720
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:19,321
Go back to town,
get Virginia!

721
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:20,755
Get Virginia,
Jake.

722
01:04:20,823 --> 01:04:21,756
What about you?

723
01:04:21,824 --> 01:04:24,125
I'm good, I'm good.
I just-

724
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:26,094
I'm gonna find him.
Go!

725
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:28,096
Go go go!

726
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:04,900
(struggles)

727
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:44,372
Did you expect them
to kill this many?

728
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:49,778
No, I did not.

729
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:56,017
(yells)

730
01:05:58,254 --> 01:06:00,188
(screams)

731
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:05,460
(fights)

732
01:06:05,928 --> 01:06:07,862
(screams)

733
01:06:15,871 --> 01:06:17,806
Where's my sister?

734
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:23,011
Done.

735
01:06:33,089 --> 01:07:02,917
(screams)

736
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:04,919
They're not back yet.
Something must be wrong.

737
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:08,656
I'm going after them.

738
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:10,592
I'll come with you.

739
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:12,594
No.

740
01:07:12,795 --> 01:07:14,596
You'll only
slow me down.

741
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:38,353
He'll pay for this,
I promise you.

742
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:41,623
<i>(Gabriel) Don't fool yourself, Nathan.</i>

743
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:44,592
<i>(Gabriel)
You're with us now.</i>

744
01:07:45,761 --> 01:07:47,695
<i>(Gabriel) Look deep
inside yourself Nathan.</i>

745
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:50,065
<i>(Gabriel) You know it's
true. You wanna be a wolf.</i>

746
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:29,270
<i>(Gabriel)
Nathan-</i>

747
01:08:29,672 --> 01:08:31,606
<i>(Gabriel) Their death was inevitable.</i>

748
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:33,608
<i>(Gabriel) Yours doesn't have to be.</i>

749
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,654
Welcome.

750
01:08:58,033 --> 01:08:59,968
Don't be afraid.

751
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:02,837
It's just me.
In your head.

752
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:05,640
Oh yeah?

753
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:07,642
Well then come out
and face me.

754
01:09:10,112 --> 01:09:12,046
<i>(Gabriel) If they kill
me you'll change back.</i>

755
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:14,315
<i>(Gabriel) Think of what I've given you.</i>

756
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:16,918
(Virginia) Nathan! Nathan!

757
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:21,356
(gun shots firing)

758
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:25,193
Nathan!

759
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:27,662
Nathan!

760
01:09:27,863 --> 01:09:29,664
Virginia!

761
01:09:29,865 --> 01:09:31,666
Oh Virginia,
you okay?

762
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:33,668
Just get me down.
Just get me down.

763
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:36,437
Where are my brothers?

764
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,940
I gotta get you down-

765
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:40,975
Nathan, where are
my brothers?

766
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:43,578
We don't have time for
this!

767
01:09:44,413 --> 01:09:46,347
No!

768
01:09:48,584 --> 01:09:51,352
<i>(Gabriel) Should you choose to
remain with her, she will kill you.</i>

769
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:53,721
<i>(Gabriel) That is of
course unless you turn.</i>

770
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:57,458
<i>(Gabriel) You could have it
all, turn her and it's all yours.</i>

771
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:01,563
<i>(Gabriel) Tonight I
will be coming for her.</i>

772
01:10:55,284 --> 01:10:57,218
When I was a little
girl all I wanted was

773
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:59,220
to grow up
so I could hunt.

774
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:04,592
Carry on the family
tradition.

775
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:06,628
Seemed so grand,
so exciting.

776
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:13,768
It made us special.

777
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:17,805
The secret
we couldn't share.

778
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:19,807
Knowing something
no one else did.

779
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:23,978
It was magical.

780
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:27,849
I felt the same way.

781
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:30,518
We all did.

782
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:33,354
Now it's all
come down to you.

783
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:37,959
You mustn't let a single
one of them live.

784
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:46,567
I don't plan to.

785
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:13,661
Here, wear these.

786
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:15,997
We don't want you
touching any silver.

787
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:32,447
Okay, I'm gonna head
back down alright?

788
01:13:03,846 --> 01:13:05,780
Hey!

789
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:08,182
You forgot these.

790
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:10,451
Got it.

791
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:36,577
Okay. I think that's
the last of the guns,

792
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,348
and they're all fully
loaded with silver.

793
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:42,784
Good.
Then, we're ready.

794
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:56,864
I think I'm running out
of time.

795
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:01,335
I'm gonna end this
tonight.

796
01:14:02,638 --> 01:14:06,107
I think we better get me in my
cage. I can feel it starting.

797
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:15,283
I'm gonna make this
right.

798
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:19,220
Virginia,
it's time.

799
01:14:20,155 --> 01:14:22,089
You go, I'll put him
in his cage.

800
01:16:25,113 --> 01:16:27,048
(struggles)

801
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:12,860
You gotta try a bit
harder, Virginia.

802
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:19,300
Aren't you the slippery
one?

803
01:17:26,742 --> 01:17:28,676
Too bad about your
brothers, Virginia.

804
01:17:33,015 --> 01:17:35,282
I wish I could tell you
they died well.

805
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:41,622
But in the end, I find all
pure humans are cowards.

806
01:19:07,943 --> 01:19:09,877
I'm so sorry,
Nathan.

807
01:19:11,046 --> 01:19:12,980
(gun shot fires)

808
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:02,289
I told you,
I'd kill you, Gabriel.

809
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:09,296
You'll never kill
all of us.

810
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:35,356
Nathan!

811
01:21:49,704 --> 01:21:51,639
(Virginia crying)

812
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:21,535
<i>(Virginia)
Nathan!</i>

813
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:26,307
Nathan!

814
01:22:31,746 --> 01:22:33,681
Nathan!

815
01:22:37,018 --> 01:22:38,953
Nathan!

816
01:22:40,922 --> 01:22:42,856
Nathan?

817
01:22:43,992 --> 01:22:45,926
GRRRRRRRR!

818
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:49,196
(Nathan snarling)

819
01:22:49,397 --> 01:22:52,666
(Nathan howling)

820
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:32,833
You're bleeding.

821
01:24:33,034 --> 01:24:34,835
It's okay,
it's not my blood.

822
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:42,543
Gabriel's dead. I think
the rest of the pack, too.

823
01:24:44,112 --> 01:24:46,046
Good that means
it's just me then.

824
01:24:52,854 --> 01:24:54,788
It wasn't supposed
to end this way.

825
01:24:56,624 --> 01:24:58,559
It doesn't have
to end.

826
01:25:00,995 --> 01:25:02,930
<i>I wanna have a life
with you, Virginia.</i>

827
01:25:05,366 --> 01:25:07,301
That would be nice.

828
01:25:07,502 --> 01:25:09,803
Just lock me away for
the full moon, that's all.

829
01:25:10,004 --> 01:25:11,805
That doesn't work.

830
01:25:17,879 --> 01:25:19,813
Virginia, you've
been bitten.

831
01:25:21,516 --> 01:25:23,450
Hey, this gives us
a choice now.

832
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:25,886
We can do this.

833
01:25:26,087 --> 01:25:27,888
It doesn't have
to end this way.

834
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:32,226
I was so stupid.

835
01:25:33,595 --> 01:25:35,529
I wanted
a normal life.

836
01:25:36,364 --> 01:25:38,298
I wanted everything my
family fought to protect.

837
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:44,505
I'm sorry I ever
brought you here.

838
01:25:44,706 --> 01:25:46,507
Hey-
I'm not sorry.

839
01:25:48,009 --> 01:25:49,943
I'm not sorry,
okay?

840
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:52,079
We can do this.

841
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:54,114
Trust me.

842
01:25:54,315 --> 01:25:56,116
Everything's
gonna be okay.

843
01:25:59,854 --> 01:26:01,788
I promise.

844
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:04,124
I'll find a way to
control the change. Okay?

845
01:26:10,665 --> 01:26:12,599
(Nathan struggles)

846
01:26:23,878 --> 01:26:25,812
I love you, Nathan.
I always will.

847
01:26:33,421 --> 01:26:53,307
