So?

1019
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:16,549
Is anything wrong?

1020
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:17,715
Yeah.

1021
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:19,275
Yeah, my dad died.

1022
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:20,833
No, I know.

1023
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,236
I wish I could've met him.
I'm sure he was a great man.

1024
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:27,875
He was.

1025
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,958
I got to do this.

1026
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:36,194
Charlotte.

1027
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:38,514
Charlotte.

1028
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,312
-What do you want, Will?
-What do I want?

1029
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:44,158
I just want you to know that I'm here
for you.

1030
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:45,918
Okay, got it. What else?

1031
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:48,838
And not to worry about the daycare.
I can handle that until you come back.

1032
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:49,915
That's it.

1033
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:50,916
Listen, I'm sorry, okay.

1034
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:53,315
It's just a lot to deal with right now,
and I sort of want to be alone.

1035
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:54,555
Okay. I get it, yeah.

1036
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:55,715
And look, about the band...

1037
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:00,152
Don't even worry about the band, okay?
We'll use Phil's Song for Bandslam.

1038
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:03,000
Or not. We don't have to use Phil's Song.
We can find another song, or...

1039
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,509
Hey, go ahead. Knock yourselves out.

1040
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:12,480
I mean, it's a beautiful song, Charlotte.

1041
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,390
It would make your dad proud.
It would be like he's there.

1042
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,590
Stop! Please, just stop!

1043
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:20,192
There is no us, Will. I'm not in the band.

1044
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:23,312
What? No, no, no.
Okay, we'll find another song...

1045
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,319
It's not about the song. I quit. I just quit.

1046
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:27,714
-Why?
-I don't do "why"!

1047
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,479
No, you have to. You just have to!

1048
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:38,635
Please.

1049
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,591
You really want to know why?

1050
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,468
Last summer, when my dad got sick,

1051
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:55,353
I promised God, the universe,

1052
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,318
anyone who'd listen,

1053
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,952
that I'd be different.

1054
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,799
Better. Nicer.

1055
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,798
My dad hated the way I acted
when I was with Ben.

1056
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:13,113
The way I treated kids who weren't popular.

1057
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,159
So, I changed.

1058
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:20,677
I started volunteering with the monsters.
I left my friends. I left my band.

1059
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:24,597
I left everything that set me apart
from people like...

1060
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:26,989
Me.

1061
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,109
People like me.

1062
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:37,032
So we were just this

1063
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:40,839
experiment to try and make your dad okay?

1064
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,712
No, I know how crazy this must sound...

1065
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:45,673
Honestly, Charlotte,
the thing that never made sense

1066
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:48,598
was you being my friend in the first place.

1067
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,871
Hey!
While you're up there on your high horse,

1068
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,037
ask yourself who are you
to judge me about lying?

1069
01:14:58,360 --> 01:14:59,429
Dewey!

1070
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:08,355

1071

1072
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,437
I don't know what's worse.

1073
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:21,271
Losing a father you love so much
you change your whole life for him,

1074
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:29,358
or having a father you're so ashamed of,
you make up a whole life for him.

1075
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:06,151
Can I have some beef jerky?

1076
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,279
Is he kidding?

1077
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,471
You warned me about her.

1078
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:16,312
I didn't listen.

1079
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:19,989
She can't help it.
It's how girls like that are hardwired.

1080
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:24,590
How are we hardwired?

1081
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:30,475
I mean, sure, right now, I am just a kid.

1082
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:31,749
Whatever.

1083
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,357
What's going to change?

1084
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,634
Nothing.

1085
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:41,278
I'm just going to be

1086
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,434
unhappy,

1087
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,315
alone,

1088
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,198
scared of, like, everything.

1089
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,597
You're not alone, Will.

1090
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,157
Experiment? We were just her experiment?

1091
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,518
I keep thinking...

1092
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:11,829
What?

1093
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:16,199
Well, if you were just part of
Charlotte's experiment this whole time,

1094
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:18,072
then, what is reality?

1095
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,637
What if Charlotte and her experiment are

1096
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:23,797
really a part of someone else's
larger experiment?

1097
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:28,676
I mean, what if we're being manipulated
by some greater intelligence than our own?

1098
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:31,997
And if so, is there really such a thing
as free will?

1099
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:35,468
Am I moving my hand,

1100
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:39,036
or was it predetermined by a force
I'm not even aware of?

1101

1102
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,389
See, this is why you don't have friends!

1103
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,717
All right, this is ridiculous! She doesn't
get to make our whole lives a lie!

1104
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:59,912
I mean, it was real for me.
Wasn't it real for you?

1105
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,035
I say we refuse to let Charlotte
screw this up for us.

1106
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:06,230
I mean, we've worked too hard.

1107

No. Should it?

1133

I guess not. I just didn't know how much
research you all had done, so...

1134
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:19,589

1137
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:27,716
and ran him over while he was walking
home from school.

1138
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:30,270
I heard. I'm sorry.

1139
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:34,313
Yeah. Did you hear that Will insisted
that I bring him to the funeral?

1140

And then they put him away, and it's
like they just turned it all on his kid.

1146
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,919

1147
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:02,508

on saying to him, or doing, but just don't.

Just don't. Okay?
