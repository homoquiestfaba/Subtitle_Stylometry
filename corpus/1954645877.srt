1
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:48,280
Hold on one second,
I gotta take off my necklace.

2
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,195
              Whoo!

3
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:37,629
              Mom!

4
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:46,004
        Lena! Lena! Lena!

5
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:26,004
                     This is it.

6
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:53,031
     Hey, it's from Natalie.

7
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:55,834
   "Welcome to your new home."

8
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:58,704
          That's sweet.

9
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,693
             Sorry.

10
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:57,896
        I didn't mean to
        get you all wet.

11
00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:59,731
                    That's fine,
                       I'll dry.

12
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:00,932
      Tobey, where are you?

13
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:02,034
                 Over here, mom.

14
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:06,038
Beckett, at last,
you're here!

15
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,205
           Hi Natalie.

16
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:08,573
Welcome to
your new home.

17
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:11,043
         Now I wanted to get you
          your Hamilton uniform,

18
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:14,179
                which I think...

19
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:16,815
             oh, good, it's just
         exactly the right size.

20
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,884
               Beckett, have you
               met my son Tobey?

21
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:19,885
               Hi.

22
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:21,186
              Hey.

23
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:22,988
I thought
I heard voices.

24
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,955
Hey Tobey,
good to see you.

25
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:26,091
            Hi Miles,
          how are you?

26
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:27,626
Thank you so much.

27
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:30,896
     It was my ex-husband's.

28
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:32,864
So how's the draft?

29
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,032
           What draft?

30
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:35,600
The publisher
won't wait...

31
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,129
          Can't sleep?

32
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:06,898
    It never gets dark here.

33
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,501
        Isn't that great?

34
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:14,473
I like the dark.

35
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:18,276
           You know, Hamilton is
           a really good school.

36
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:21,847
                 We're lucky Nat
               could get you in.

37
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,290
I know it's hard, Beck, but this
 will be good for us, you know?

38
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:35,560
    It's like a fresh start.

39
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,663
Okay, dad.

40
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:53,812
Aren't you coming?

41
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:55,714
                 I don't want to
                  embarrass you.

42
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:58,917
                      You go on,
                       have fun.

43
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,519
            Welcome to Hamilton,
                        Rebecca.

44
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,455
                  I am Ms. Neal,
                 your principal.

45
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:39,624
It's Beckett,
not Rebecca.

46
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,761
                        Beckett,
                      of course.

47
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:46,531
       Ladies, I'd like to
    introduce Beckett Warner.

48
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:47,666
           Say Hello.

49
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:50,635
        You can take that
        seat in the back.

50
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,504
Thanks.

51
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:59,644
   So...we need to talk about
 what's happened to our heroine.

52
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,016
             Sunday?

53
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:06,852
       Um...devirginated.

54
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:09,087
            And so...

55
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,756
        So she's without
      value to her family.

56
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:14,559
                    Very good...
                Any other ideas?

57
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:27,572
         Hey, new girl.

58
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:31,810
         You might want
         to be careful.

59
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:33,512
            I'm Jen.

60
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:34,513
                        Beckett.

61
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,014
So what brings
you to Hamilton?

62
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,283
                    I just moved
                    to the city.

63
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:40,185
Is it job
or divorce?

64
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,220
                 My mother died.

65
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:45,857
Oh...I'm sorry,
that sucks.

66
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:14,953
        You dropped this.

67
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,703
              Everything's gonna
                     be alright.

68
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:35,574
      Let's just go to my office
       and we can talk about it.

69
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:09,534
                        Beckett?

70
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:13,104
 I'm afraid our garden is closed
       for renovation this year.

71
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:14,806
Sorry.

72
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:16,408
                      It's okay.

73
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,642
                   Why don't you
                   come with me?

74
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:19,678
                        Come on.

75
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:36,761
Come on.

76
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:42,600
This is our
founder's parlor.

77
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:43,368
             Hello.

78
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,503
        Beckett, come in!

79
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:50,742
  She's a Hamilton mother and a
member of our board of trustees.

80
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:52,243
         How do you do?

81
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:53,578
And this is
Vivienne Carpenter.

82
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,913
She's in charge of
the upper school.

83
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,481
      We were just talking
         about your dad.

84
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:58,483
                   Her father is
                   Miles Warner.

85
00:11:58,485 --> 00:11:59,751
Natalie's publishing
his new book.

86
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:00,919
              Yes.

87
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:03,922
       I am such a big fan
        of your father's.

88
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:09,227
     We read his last one...
 it had beautiful poetry in it.

89
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,819
                    Oh! Beckett?

90
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:37,055
                Are you alright?

91
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:38,656
       Honey, you alright?

92
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:41,025
    Yeah, I just feel dizzy.

93
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:43,328
          Let me take you to the
             nurse's office, ok?

94
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,929
                           Yeah?

95
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,665
                   Come with me.

96
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,501
  Pamela will fix her right up.

97
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:51,002
    I heard about her mother.

98
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,170
             So sad.

99
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,777
                 Pamela, I think
             you made a mistake.

100
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,578
                 That's a rectal
                    thermometer.

101
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,347
Well, then it's in
the right place.

102
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:03,448
          You're fine.

103
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,349
       Thank you, Sunday.

104
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:06,017
No, I'm sick.

105
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,085
Help me.

106
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,119
              Out.

107
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,621
                  You heard her,
                     Chloe, out.

108
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,556
I'm going,
I'm going.

109
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,860
Everything is going
to be fine, ok?

110
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,130
                        Come on!

111
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,167
  Careful, we're all sick here.

112
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:25,570
       Hey Chloe, wait up.

113
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:27,772
 Would you like to come through?

114
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,045
       You want to hop on?

115
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:40,685
  So you're the new girl, huh?

116
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:42,821
     You can call me Pamela.

117
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:43,721
                        Beckett.

118
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,757
Why don't you
lie down?

119
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,833
      How are you feeling?

120
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:56,467
            I'm fine.

121
00:13:56,469 --> 00:14:00,438
 Just a little bit dizzy before.

122
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,273
      I like your necklace.

123
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:04,909
   Thanks, it was my mother's.

124
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,348
      Have you eaten today?

125
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,652
Yeah, probably not
enough though.

126
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:19,924
       Alright, under your
       tongue, that's it.

127
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:23,294
       I remember my first
     day here as a student.

128
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:26,431
  It was a very long time ago.

129
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,166
         It gets better.

130
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:32,604
Alright.

131
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:35,173
Well, looks fine.

132
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:36,941
I think you're tired.

133
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:38,910
Why don't you stay here,
lie down for a while,

134
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:41,279
and I'll come back
and get you.

135
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:43,681
           Thank you.

136
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:25,023
        Lena! Lena! Lena!

137
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,884
It can be quite challenging, but
 I think it's also quite a gift.

138
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:56,187
  We like to think of ourselves
     a little like a family.

139
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:59,457
Well, that is exactly what
she needs right now.

140
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,992
    What are you doing here?

141
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:02,160
Hey, honey.

142
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:03,661
Your nurse called me.

143
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,396
We thought we'd let
you sleep for a while.

144
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:06,531
You okay?

145
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:07,999
                           Yeah.

146
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,036
       Thank you again for
        staying with her.

147
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:14,806
              It was fine, I was
            working late anyway.

148
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:17,942
                          Miles!

149
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:19,777
            Natalie!

150
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,546
                Beckett, how are
                    you feeling?

151
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:23,748
     Much better, thank you.

152
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,583
Hi, I'm Ms. Lawrence.

153
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:26,517
        Nice to meet you.

154
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,819
Beckett, hello.

155
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,253
Pamela, you ready?

156
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:31,589
We were just looking for you.

157
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,257
                  Get home safe.

158
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:39,464
            This is the Hamilton
               Alumni Book Club.

159
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:40,732
Ladies, shall we resume?

160
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:44,635
  It's one way to get your blood
      pumping on a Friday night.

161
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:47,472
You better make your
escape while you can.

162
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:48,873
          Thanks again.

163
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,508
It was a pleasure
to meet you.

164
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:27,011
        Your nurse seems nice...
             for a school nurse.

165
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:28,479
Dad...

166
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:36,954
                            Hey!

167
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,161
             What are you doing?

168
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:44,462
                 Come back here!

169
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,000
                     What is it?

170
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:55,206
                    We'll get it
               on Monday, honey.

171
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,340
No!

172
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:58,109
Help me.

173
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:00,344
No, no, no...No!

174
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:01,312
                        Beckett!

175
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,951
                      Oh my God.

176
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,348
                        Beckett,
              mind if I come in?

177
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,917
Oh, hi.

178
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,621
                 I wanted to see
             how you were doing.

179
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,756
Fantastic.

180
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:48,626
                    I found this
                   in my office.

181
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,828
             I thought you might
                  be missing it.

182
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,231
           Thank you.

183
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:58,269
 Your father, he mentioned that
 the police had been here again.

184
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:03,207
Yeah, I told them that I had
seen Sunday cutting herself.

185
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:07,211
I should have -- I should have
said something earlier.

186
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:11,816
      Beckett, she had been
     suffering for a while.

187
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:17,788
     It was me who should've
      done more...not you.

188
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,857
 Pamela brought us some dinner.

189
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:22,360
           You hungry?

190
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:24,295
A little.

191
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,666
    Beckett told me that you
   were also a Hamilton girl.

192
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,201
I was.

193
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:33,671
When did you realize that it was
your vocation to heal teenagers?

194
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,306
      This is really good.

195
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:38,409
Well, I was studying
botanical medicine in Paris,

196
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:41,946
where, incidentally, I read
part of your first book.

197
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:44,749
         Why not the whole book?

198
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:46,083
Distracted.

199
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,351
              How?

200
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,487
I fell in love.

201
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:52,757
                        Oh yeah,
                  that'll do it.

202
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:55,126
              And?

203
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:57,495
He died.

204
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:02,533
So are you taking
Beckett out of Hamilton?

205
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,069
                       Probably.
               No.

206
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:10,775
 Dad, I don't want to run away.

207
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:12,810
            You sure about this?

208
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:15,746
         Yeah, I'm sure.

209
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,982
                   Alright then.

210
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:23,120
Good, that's good.

211
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,529
Honey, you okay?

212
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,434
      Uh...yeah, I'm fine.

213
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:38,236
        I think I'm just
       going to go to bed.

214
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,504
             Goodnight, sweetie.

215
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:52,383
    Thank you for having me.

216
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:25,082
You feeling better?

217
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:30,788
                     Dad...Yeah,
                    I'm alright.

218
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,823
             How late did Pamela
                 end up staying?

219
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:35,426
She left pretty soon
after you drifted off.

220
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:38,529
It was nice of her
to come see you.

221
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:40,531
                           Yeah.

222
00:21:55,047 --> 00:22:00,651
           So Beckett,
     do you know what I do?

223
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,120
          You're a psychiatrist.

224
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:06,257
Yeah, and in the wake of
Sunday Wilson's death,

225
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:09,894
I'll be seeing students
on a weekly basis.

226
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:12,730
           Did you treat Sunday?

227
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:15,366
Yes, I did.

228
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:17,902
Do you think about
Sunday a lot?

229
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:18,969
                            Yes.

230
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:22,306
         Why she killed herself,
          and if she was scared,

231
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:27,011
                 what she was so
              scared of exactly.

232
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,747
What do you think
she was scared of?

233
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:31,382
                   I don't know.

234
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:35,386
          Aren't you the one who
        talked to her every day?

235
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:14,191
That's Sunday's mom.

236
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:19,363
             Wow...she's so good
                   at being sad.

237
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:20,765
              Is that a horrible
                   thing to say?

238
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:23,033
Her daughter almost
squished you.

239
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:25,469
You can say whatever
the hell you want.

240
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:32,610
     I can't believe that Pamela
          ate at your apartment.

241
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:35,446
     Her like great-great-great,
       or something, grandmother

242
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:37,014
             founded this school
           so she inherited like

243
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:39,950
           mad amounts of money.

244
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:42,353
            Are she and your dad
           like boning hard yet?

245
00:23:42,355 --> 00:23:44,488
What, Jen?

246
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,490
                      I'm sorry.

247
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:47,758
                  Was that rude?

248
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:56,967
  Do you think that Chloe knew
    Sunday was going to jump?

249
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:59,003
 I mean, they were best friends.

250
00:23:59,005 --> 00:24:01,872
       They had a pact to
     stay virgins together.

251
00:24:01,874 --> 00:24:02,940
I don't know.

252
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:05,509
I kind of wish
I knew Sunday better.

253
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:09,013
             Ok, well, you could
               always ask Tobey.

254
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:11,482
                      He used to
                go out with her.

255
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,287
You know him?

256
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:19,723
           Do you like him or --

257
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:34,004
It's sine,
not cosine.

258
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:37,241
                         Thanks.

259
00:24:37,243 --> 00:24:43,848
So, uh, Jen says
you dated Sunday?

260
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,283
                 Um, not really.

261
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:49,353
       I mean, we held hands and
     fed each other French fries

262
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:52,590
     for a summer, but you know,
                that's about it.

263
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:54,892
         I'm sorry, I...

264
00:24:54,894 --> 00:24:58,362
Let's go!

265
00:24:58,364 --> 00:24:59,997
Now.

266
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:01,825
What floor is yours?

267
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:02,726
                       12th one.

268
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,528
              Come on, let's go.

269
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:15,272
Hi Eddie.

270
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:16,140
          Hey, ladies.

271
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:17,575
Hi.

272
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,748
              Jen?

273
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:27,351
Beckett...

274
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:29,520
This is my mother.

275
00:26:29,522 --> 00:26:32,156
        Beckett, so nice
          to meet you.

276
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:33,857
                       You, too.

277
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:35,526
           Did you eat
           yet, honey?

278
00:26:35,528 --> 00:26:36,860
Yes, Ava.

279
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:38,495
       What did you have?

280
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:39,530
Salad.

281
00:26:39,532 --> 00:26:41,465
              Okay.

282
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:46,136
  This is all she does all day,
       like go to the gym

283
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:48,172
       and take vitamins,
       and stay hydrated,

284
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:51,675
    not with water of course.

285
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:53,811
       Do you see the way
      that she looks at me?

286
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:55,913
    It's like I'm mold, like,
      she's like disgusted

287
00:26:55,915 --> 00:26:58,015
    that I've grown this far.

288
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,954
                 Jen, your room,
               I really like it.

289
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,456
Thanks.

290
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:08,158
Kent says it's really important
for me to create my own world

291
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,661
because Ava is
an alcoholic.

292
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:12,963
                  Well, my dad's
                   an alcoholic.

293
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:17,768
            What if they went to
     meetings together sometime?

294
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:20,204
             I wish.

295
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:22,272
               How long have you
           been seeing Dr. Kent?

296
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:23,574
Once a week since
I was little.

297
00:27:23,576 --> 00:27:25,109
Ava figured if I didn't
have a dad, then I should

298
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:27,444
at least have like
a steady therapist.

299
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:31,315
She and Kent went
to school together.

300
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:32,449
Come on.

301
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:35,052
Let's get you out
of that uniform.

302
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:37,688
         These are cute.

303
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:46,563
            Kick it,
          kick flip it.

304
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:48,198
           You can get
        higher than that.

305
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:04,014
                     Hey Jenski.

306
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,282
   Hirsch, what are you doing?

307
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:07,951
     Just go sit over there.

308
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:11,288
           You know, I bet I can
        flip this chip from here

309
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,057
           using only my tongue.

310
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:16,694
 If that chip leaves your mouth,
   I'm going to dismember you.

311
00:28:16,696 --> 00:28:18,896
                    Yes, please!

312
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:19,963
          Hello again.

313
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:23,167
Hi.

314
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:24,835
           You skate?

315
00:28:24,837 --> 00:28:26,003
Not really.

316
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:31,275
         You should try.

317
00:28:31,277 --> 00:28:33,677
Okay.

318
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:39,783
                   There you go.

319
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:41,885
                  Want to learn?

320
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,854
You want to teach me?

321
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:50,461
Hey, Pamela just
dropped by to see you.

322
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:52,262
I thought you'd
be home sooner.

323
00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:53,130
              Hey.

324
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:53,897
                             Hi.

325
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,066
She's kicking my ass.

326
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,835
          What is this?

327
00:29:00,706 --> 00:29:02,473
                          Where?

328
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:07,678
How did I miss that?

329
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,280
          Come on, stay
          and help me.

330
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:12,683
I'm tired, I think
I'm going to go to bed.

331
00:29:12,685 --> 00:29:16,920
                  Well, then I'm
               out of here, too.

332
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:20,691
            Beckett, I wanted to
             give you something.

333
00:29:20,693 --> 00:29:25,095
         I just thought it would
         look incredible on you.

334
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:27,598
           I couldn't resist it.

335
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:32,469
     This is really pretty.

336
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:33,570
           Thank you!

337
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:35,239
                 You're welcome.

338
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:59,897
              Dad?

339
00:30:07,706 --> 00:30:09,006
            Help me.

340
00:30:09,008 --> 00:30:10,240
      Help me comb my hair.

341
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:13,143
         Please help me.

342
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:16,847
        Help me! Help me!

343
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,950
         It's ok, baby,
          it's alright.

344
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:22,619
         Wake up, baby,
        wake up, come on.

345
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:26,423
          There you go.

346
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:33,030
        Just a bad dream.

347
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:35,899
It's alright, baby.

348
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:39,203
It's ok, it's ok.

349
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:43,774
I...had a dream about
Sunday last night.

350
00:30:43,776 --> 00:30:46,910
              Yeah?

351
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:51,315
She asked me to
comb her hair.

352
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:53,183
          Did you comb her hair?

353
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:55,185
I wanted to.

354
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,788
                  You wanted to?

355
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,158
               Beckett, who used
              to comb your hair?

356
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,526
My mom.

357
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:05,629
                           Nice.

358
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:08,031
       Do you sometimes feel you
       could've helped your mom?

359
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:09,633
She had an aneurysm.

360
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:11,702
There was nothing
I could do.

361
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:14,571
              That's true but is
               that how you feel

362
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:18,575
              or is that how you
          think you should feel?

363
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:21,478
I don't know.

364
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,080
         You don't have to know.

365
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:25,249
      You just let your feelings
    come out when they're ready.

366
00:31:25,251 --> 00:31:28,051
      In the meantime, I'm going
        to write a prescription.

367
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,390
           It'll help you sleep.

368
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,517
               Hi.

369
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,919
    Brought you my old deck.

370
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,390
That's goofy,
that's goofy style.

371
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,326
             I like being goofy.

372
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:44,928
Basically the trick to the ollie
is it's basically like

373
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:48,198
a one-footed jump, but the
second that the tail hits

374
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,100
the ground, you're up off the
board and then your front foot

375
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:55,639
slides forward and levels
the board out so --

376
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:57,741
I'll just show you.

377
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:04,915
Here, why don't
you try?

378
00:33:04,917 --> 00:33:06,483
I got you.

379
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:14,458
That's good,
that's really good.

380
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,826
You can't overthink
it though,

381
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:20,464
you just gotta put the
moves down and just...

382
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:23,900
That was good...
sort of.

383
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:30,107
No, no, no,
please not by myself.

384
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:46,490
Hi.

385
00:33:46,492 --> 00:33:48,625
                 Where were you?

386
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:51,428
I was at the park
with Jen and Tobey.

387
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,529
I texted you.

388
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,631
                 Is that why you
                 smell like pot?

389
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:57,267
I don't know, I guess
some kids were smoking --

390
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:59,603
          It won't mix with your
             prescription, Beck.

391
00:33:59,605 --> 00:34:02,172
Dad, I don't smoke pot.

392
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:04,474
    And on school nights, I want
  you home by seven from now on.

393
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:07,644
I don't need you to tell
me to do my homework.

394
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:09,346
                           Good.

395
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,356
Miles...

396
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:21,391
                   Are you okay?

397
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:25,195
Yeah, I'm fine.

398
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:29,199
     Natalie, she persuaded your
   father to read at our benefit

399
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:38,842
 and he's not too thrilled about
 it...and I think he misses you.

400
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:55,352
               Beckett...are you
              taking your pills?

401
00:35:55,354 --> 00:35:57,320
              Good.

402
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:00,390
       Anymore nightmares?

403
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:05,996
No...

404
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:14,037
but sometimes I hear these
sounds that aren't there.

405
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:16,973
              Do you see things?

406
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:21,945
There you are,
I was waiting for you.

407
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:25,182
Come on, let's
get out of here.

408
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:59,115
        You've done this
         before, right?

409
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:01,284
                   Yeah, and I'm
                  very hygienic,

410
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:03,386
                  you know that.

411
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:06,289
Ok, go for it.

412
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:08,425
                  Tobey is going
                   to love this.

413
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:11,127
        It's not for him.

414
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:13,530
             Right.

415
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:18,435
   Gloves, ice, extra alcohol,
     extremely clean needle.

416
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:20,971
               Just count to 15.

417
00:37:20,973 --> 00:37:28,712
One, two, three,

418
00:37:28,714 --> 00:37:41,658
four...ow...five...

419
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,727
           Beautiful.

420
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:54,471
So, let's see it.

421
00:37:54,473 --> 00:37:56,640
                           Okay.

422
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:06,983
That's not bad.

423
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:09,219
You must have a pretty
amazing teacher.

424
00:38:09,221 --> 00:38:12,122
                          Where?

425
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:14,491
Now you just have to
teach me how to surf.

426
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:16,593
           I don't surf anymore.

427
00:38:16,595 --> 00:38:18,094
Why's that?

428
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:19,562
              Because of my mom.

429
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:21,264
Right.

430
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:23,833
I'm sorry, that was
a stupid question.

431
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:26,069
                      It's okay.

432
00:38:26,071 --> 00:38:28,271
                I think you'd be
                  a good surfer.

433
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:41,184
So, you wanna
come over?

434
00:39:39,411 --> 00:39:40,677
         Today was fun.

435
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:42,879
                   Yeah, it was.

436
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:48,318
        Literally, five seconds,
                 I swear to God.

437
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,620
Just dedicate it
to the color of...

438
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:07,530
You're bleeding.

439
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:08,865
           It's okay.

440
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:12,368
                       Sit down.

441
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:22,946
                   Let's see it.

442
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:31,921
                It's might sting
                       a little.

443
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:43,766
              There, all better.

444
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:45,702
         Thanks, nurse.

445
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:11,127
     Tobey, turn it down --

446
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:13,663
               Jeez, mom, knock.

447
00:42:13,665 --> 00:42:17,367
        Beckett, you need
        to go home...now.

448
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:44,060
              Hey.

449
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:48,164
                 Where's my dad?

450
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:50,700
       He's at a meeting.

451
00:42:55,239 --> 00:43:01,911
We got some review copies
in at the book club.

452
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,581
Natalie called.

453
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:08,585
                      We weren't
                 doing anything.

454
00:43:08,587 --> 00:43:11,955
Listen, if you rush into
something that should be

455
00:43:11,957 --> 00:43:17,093
so beautiful,
it can turn ugly.

456
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:19,629
Do you understand?

457
00:43:19,631 --> 00:43:22,699
                     Does my dad
                know about this?

458
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:27,236
No, and he doesn't need to
if you promise me

459
00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:31,007
not to rush into
anything with Tobey.

460
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:33,876
Can you do that?

461
00:43:43,755 --> 00:43:45,588
              Yes.

462
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:49,626
Goodnight, Beckett.

463
00:43:49,628 --> 00:43:51,961
                      Goodnight.

464
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,076
Help me.

465
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:12,382
            Help me!

466
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:26,562
           So when are you going
             to see Tobey again?

467
00:44:26,564 --> 00:44:30,066
Never if Natalie and
Pamela get their way.

468
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:36,072
     Well, we can be pure as the
      driven snow together then.

469
00:44:36,074 --> 00:44:37,607
Why is that?

470
00:44:37,609 --> 00:44:41,277
                 Hirsch was with
               Chloe last night.

471
00:45:02,567 --> 00:45:05,268
36...

472
00:45:08,073 --> 00:45:10,173
            Help me.

473
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,544
              So Dr. Kent bailed
                 on our session.

474
00:46:21,546 --> 00:46:24,213
           I was going to see if
        you wanted to come over.

475
00:46:24,215 --> 00:46:26,115
             Is everything okay?

476
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:30,186
    Jen, it happened before.

477
00:46:30,188 --> 00:46:32,722
                           What?

478
00:46:32,724 --> 00:46:37,627
       Ew, gross, I think my mom
      actually knew those girls.

479
00:46:37,629 --> 00:46:40,329
Um, I have to go.

480
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:42,565
                        Beckett?

481
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:48,805
Beckett.

482
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:52,975
                            Bye.

483
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:04,887
     I was wondering if you
      knew these two girls.

484
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:11,661
     No, I didn't know them.

485
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:14,964
                Because Ava said
              that she knew them

486
00:47:14,966 --> 00:47:18,634
        and I know you guys went
        to school together so...

487
00:47:18,636 --> 00:47:23,439
   Yes, Ava and I did, but she
    was in a different class.

488
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:28,544
She's a few years older than me.

489
00:47:28,546 --> 00:47:31,214
   Beckett, I really wouldn't
        believe too much

490
00:47:31,216 --> 00:47:32,949
    of what Ava says to you.

491
00:47:32,951 --> 00:47:37,053
   She's having some personal
        issues right now.

492
00:47:37,055 --> 00:47:39,222
    I'm sure you've noticed.

493
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,894
  You should get back to class.

494
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:51,067
  Only when Odysseus comes home
 is the heroic cycle completed.

495
00:47:51,069 --> 00:47:55,338
       That's what I want
       you to write about.

496
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,106
   A cycle from your own life.

497
00:47:57,108 --> 00:47:59,175
     Write something brave.

498
00:47:59,177 --> 00:48:00,743
Like, brave how?

499
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:11,888
          Chloe. Chloe!

500
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:15,157
   Those flowers that you were
   drawing before in class...

501
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:18,194
     Sunday, she had them in
   her hair the day she died.

502
00:48:18,196 --> 00:48:22,665
Look, Beckett, I don't
want to play with you.

503
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:36,979
Where did you find this?

504
00:48:36,981 --> 00:48:40,149
   Someone mentioned it to me
       so I looked it up.

505
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:47,657
So you're drawing a connection
between these two girls

506
00:48:47,659 --> 00:48:49,725
who drowned and Sunday.

507
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:50,826
                 I'm not drawing
                   a connection.

508
00:48:50,828 --> 00:48:54,430
          There is a connection.

509
00:48:54,432 --> 00:49:01,570
   They all went to Hamilton and
     they all killed themselves.

510
00:49:01,572 --> 00:49:03,406
So what is it about Hamilton
that makes students

511
00:49:03,408 --> 00:49:05,708
want to kill themselves?

512
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:08,945
         I'm not quite sure yet.

513
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:28,297
              Dad?

514
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:33,235
    I really don't want to read.

515
00:49:33,237 --> 00:49:34,370
              Do I have to read?

516
00:49:34,372 --> 00:49:40,443
Yes.

517
00:49:40,445 --> 00:49:42,278
                 Where's my tie?

518
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,879
               I know it's here.

519
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:48,517
           Hey honey.

520
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:49,585
            Come on.

521
00:49:49,587 --> 00:49:51,420
        It's time to go.

522
00:50:06,537 --> 00:50:07,937
                      Beautiful.

523
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:31,394
        Beckett, you look
           beautiful.

524
00:50:31,396 --> 00:50:32,762
        Miles, very nice.

525
00:50:32,764 --> 00:50:34,296
Where's Tobey?

526
00:50:34,298 --> 00:50:35,564
           He's home.

527
00:50:35,566 --> 00:50:36,832
         He was swamped
        with schoolwork.

528
00:50:36,834 --> 00:50:40,302
        He was very sorry
          to miss you.

529
00:50:40,304 --> 00:50:41,137
           Come on in.

530
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:43,773
Thank you.

531
00:51:24,782 --> 00:51:27,650
       Semper et aeternum.

532
00:51:27,652 --> 00:51:31,120
       Always and forever.

533
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:36,258
     Beckett, if you'll just
     excuse us for a moment.

534
00:51:38,029 --> 00:51:40,596
                 I'm just tired,
          I'm tired of all this.

535
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:42,531
     You're not tired, Ava,
          you're drunk.

536
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:03,085
Hello...I know
I've seen you before.

537
00:52:03,087 --> 00:52:05,621
Have you lived
in Perugia?

538
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:07,756
         No, I'm afraid
           I haven't.

539
00:52:07,758 --> 00:52:10,559
     Perhaps it was somebody
       who looked like me.

540
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:12,761
                    I'm sorry to
                    interrupt --

541
00:52:40,091 --> 00:52:45,628
     Please no, please don't
         be angry at me.

542
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:48,998
We're not angry at you.

543
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,433
We're disappointed.

544
00:52:51,435 --> 00:52:54,203
          Malia, Malia!

545
00:52:54,205 --> 00:52:58,807
Don't call me that,
don't call me that.

546
00:52:58,809 --> 00:53:06,782
You need to
go to sleep.

547
00:53:06,784 --> 00:53:09,385
You'll be better
in the morning.

548
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:50,259
   Come on, let's go outside.

549
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:53,662
                    It's locked.

550
00:53:53,664 --> 00:53:57,132
I got mom's keys.

551
00:54:51,355 --> 00:54:52,755
                   What's wrong?

552
00:54:54,825 --> 00:54:57,026
                           Beck?

553
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:04,233
            Where are you going?

554
00:55:04,235 --> 00:55:05,801
                           Beck?

555
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:22,217
     Hey, I've been looking
       for you everywhere.

556
00:55:22,219 --> 00:55:24,553
      Where have you been?

557
00:55:24,555 --> 00:55:26,822
       I thought that you
     were at home studying?

558
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:28,991
I am.

559
00:55:28,993 --> 00:55:29,925
               Do you have a key
                   for this one?

560
00:55:29,927 --> 00:55:31,060
Yeah, of course.

561
00:55:35,532 --> 00:55:38,500
   Your mom just left the keys
   where you could find them?

562
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:40,803
      That's kind of weird.

563
00:55:40,805 --> 00:55:42,404
                    What are you
                    looking for?

564
00:55:42,406 --> 00:55:43,806
             Relax.

565
00:55:43,808 --> 00:55:45,507
                   What is this?

566
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:47,443
     It's a Shirley Temple.

567
00:55:47,445 --> 00:55:49,278
                 Ah, it's gross.

568
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,846
                     How can you
                     drink that?

569
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:52,648
     I think it's delicious.

570
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:54,216
           Your loss.

571
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:06,929
 Don't lay down on that, Tobey.

572
00:56:06,931 --> 00:56:08,697
        It's disgusting.

573
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:09,998
                      It's fine,
                  they clean it.

574
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,567
          This place is
          kinda creepy.

575
00:56:11,569 --> 00:56:13,302
             You can go back out
               if you want, Jen.

576
00:56:13,304 --> 00:56:15,971
Why is it I don't
like that idea?

577
00:56:15,973 --> 00:56:17,306
             What are you doing?

578
00:56:17,308 --> 00:56:18,941
    I'm trying to figure out
       what kind of pills

579
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:21,443
   Pamela is giving to Chloe.

580
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:26,949
        This is Vicodin.

581
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:28,517
           Excellent.

582
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:33,589
   Hey, maybe we should not be
  going through Pamela's meds.

583
00:56:33,591 --> 00:56:35,724
         Can we just go?

584
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:37,760
Stop complaining.

585
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:56,678
Am I interrupting
something?

586
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,281
  I wasn't feeling well so I was
      just looking for something

587
00:56:59,283 --> 00:57:03,786
          to help with the pain.

588
00:57:03,788 --> 00:57:06,755
Tobey, Jen, will you go
rejoin the others please?

589
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:21,537
         We really weren't doing
               anything, Pamela.

590
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:28,811
Sunday, she gave me
this the day she died.

591
00:57:28,813 --> 00:57:30,679
       My family have been
    looking after this school

592
00:57:30,681 --> 00:57:32,181
    for generations, Beckett.

593
00:57:32,183 --> 00:57:33,882
  These are private keepsakes.

594
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:36,118
       Do you understand?

595
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:39,621
  Are you testing me, Beckett?

596
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:42,191
  Breaking into a school office
         crosses a line

597
00:57:42,193 --> 00:57:43,325
      that you can't cross!

598
00:57:43,327 --> 00:57:44,026
       Do you understand?

599
00:57:44,028 --> 00:57:45,093
Yes.

600
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:47,796
I already told you
I wasn't feeling well.

601
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,665
                 Beckett, do not
                      lie to me.

602
00:57:49,667 --> 00:57:53,001
Dad, do you not see
what's been going on here?

603
00:57:53,003 --> 00:57:54,102
                           What?

604
00:57:54,104 --> 00:57:55,537
She was giving pills
to Sunday, okay,

605
00:57:55,539 --> 00:57:57,773
and now she's trying to
give them to Chloe, too.

606
00:57:57,775 --> 00:57:59,274
Will you just
listen to me?

607
00:57:59,276 --> 00:58:01,176
         She's the school nurse,
                        Beckett.

608
00:58:01,178 --> 00:58:04,346
          If a student is taking
          prescribed medication,

609
00:58:04,348 --> 00:58:07,282
It's more than that and
you're not listening!

610
00:58:07,284 --> 00:58:09,384
            What more than that?
     What are you talking about?

611
00:58:09,386 --> 00:58:11,220
              Pamela, explain to
                her what you do.

612
00:58:11,222 --> 00:58:12,654
                     What is she
                  talking about?

613
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:14,723
         Beckett, do not
       walk away from me.

614
00:58:14,725 --> 00:58:19,628
      Rebecca, I am trying
         to talk to you.

615
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:25,234
               Rebecca? Rebecca,
     I am trying to talk to you.

616
00:58:25,236 --> 00:58:26,535
                   What is that?

617
00:58:26,537 --> 00:58:29,238
It's nothing.

618
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:32,140
         That is a hunk of metal
           in your belly button.

619
00:58:32,142 --> 00:58:36,044
You know what, Dad,
it's mine...Mine!

620
00:58:36,046 --> 00:58:37,246
So get out!

621
00:58:37,248 --> 00:58:39,815
            Can I talk with her,
                  please, Miles?

622
00:58:39,817 --> 00:58:41,683
Get out!

623
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:56,999
  You know, you really remind me
  of myself when I was your age.

624
00:58:57,001 --> 00:59:00,435
             You're so stubborn.

625
00:59:00,437 --> 00:59:06,775
I am nothing like you,
whatever you are.

626
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:20,656
                 Beckett, honey?

627
00:59:20,658 --> 00:59:24,560
      Talk to me, Beckett,
     talk to me, talk to me.

628
00:59:24,562 --> 00:59:26,295
                      It's okay,
                   it's alright.

629
00:59:26,297 --> 00:59:29,131
                It's okay, baby,
                it's okay, baby.

630
00:59:29,133 --> 00:59:31,433
            I'm here, it's okay.

631
00:59:31,435 --> 00:59:37,339
             It's gonna be okay,
    it's gonna be okay, alright.

632
00:59:44,281 --> 00:59:46,481
There you go.

633
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:55,290
I'll be back pretty late
so the deal is,

634
00:59:55,292 --> 00:59:57,993
you're not going to leave
the apartment, right?

635
00:59:57,995 --> 00:59:59,761
                           Okay.

636
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:10,038
I love you.

637
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:45,374
Hey Hirsch.

638
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:56,585
Do you trust me?
You gotta try this.

639
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:06,461
Just stay cool and
wait...trust me.

640
01:02:01,984 --> 01:02:06,154
              Hey.

641
01:02:06,156 --> 01:02:09,825
            Hold on.

642
01:02:09,827 --> 01:02:10,792
              Hey.

643
01:02:10,794 --> 01:02:11,960
              <i> Hi.</i>

644
01:02:11,962 --> 01:02:14,596
     <i> Um, can you come over?</i>

645
01:02:14,598 --> 01:02:16,098
     <i> It's really important.</i>

646
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,933
      I don't think I can.

647
01:02:17,935 --> 01:02:20,469
  <i> Tobey, I'm serious, I really</i>
     <i> need you to come over.</i>

648
01:02:20,471 --> 01:02:21,803
       Wait, what's wrong?

649
01:02:21,805 --> 01:02:23,205
      <i> I don't want to tell</i>
       <i> you on the phone.</i>

650
01:02:23,207 --> 01:02:24,940
         <i> I have to show</i>
         <i> you something.</i>

651
01:02:24,942 --> 01:02:25,941
    Beckett, what's going on?

652
01:02:25,943 --> 01:02:27,075
       <i> Get over here now.</i>

653
01:02:55,038 --> 01:02:56,271
                      Who is it?

654
01:02:56,273 --> 01:02:57,739
            It's me.

655
01:03:07,317 --> 01:03:10,318
                   What is that?

656
01:03:35,512 --> 01:03:41,850
Wake up.

657
01:03:41,852 --> 01:03:44,486
        You're still pure
      aren't you, Beckett?

658
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:47,956
        Beckett, wake up.

659
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:53,261
      You're just dreaming.

660
01:03:53,263 --> 01:03:55,730
        Beckett, it's me.

661
01:03:55,732 --> 01:04:03,605
      Your father asked me
       to check in on you.

662
01:04:03,607 --> 01:04:07,375
       Have you taken your
        medication today?

663
01:04:07,377 --> 01:04:13,548
              Yeah.

664
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:17,452
        You...drugged me.

665
01:04:17,454 --> 01:04:20,522
                        Beckett,
               you cut yourself.

666
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:21,389
               I'm just going to
                 clean it, okay?

667
01:04:21,391 --> 01:04:22,357
No!

668
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:24,226
       Hey, just, you lie still.

669
01:04:24,228 --> 01:04:25,527
No.

670
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:26,728
        I'm worried you're going
         to hurt yourself, okay?

671
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:28,330
           It's okay, calm down.

672
01:04:28,332 --> 01:04:29,097
Get off me!

673
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:34,035
                        Stop it.

674
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:36,404
You're one of them.

675
01:04:36,406 --> 01:04:39,541
     You know what, you're upset
  and I totally understand that,

676
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:43,144
           but I am not going to
            hurt you, I promise.

677
01:07:20,736 --> 01:07:24,139
            God...you scared me.

678
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:29,577
It's beautiful.

679
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:32,380
What is it?

680
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:34,916
                   It's for you.

681
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:45,326
              Hey, what's wrong?

682
01:07:45,328 --> 01:07:52,400
Tobey, I want you to know that
if anything ever happened to me,

683
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:56,905
I would never do anything
to hurt myself, okay?

684
01:07:56,907 --> 01:07:59,574
                        Beckett,
                what's going on?

685
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:02,177
You won't believe me.

686
01:08:02,179 --> 01:08:05,847
               Of course I will.

687
01:08:05,849 --> 01:08:12,887
It's Pamela and
the book club...

688
01:08:12,889 --> 01:08:16,524
They're trying
to kill me, Tobey.

689
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:31,673
I got you, didn't I?

690
01:08:51,561 --> 01:08:57,432
       Beckett...we don't
        have to do this.

691
01:08:57,434 --> 01:09:00,135
                      I want to.

692
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:58,259
              Hey.

693
01:09:58,261 --> 01:10:01,529
    I wasn't sure if you were
     ever going to wake up.

694
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:03,765
           Can I borrow a shirt?

695
01:10:03,767 --> 01:10:05,200
Yeah.

696
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:15,677
  I should probably get going.

697
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:17,545
        Your mom is going
        to wake up soon.

698
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:20,048
She's not going to be
back until later tonight

699
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:22,550
after the book club meeting.

700
01:10:22,552 --> 01:10:23,851
      Book club is tonight?

701
01:10:23,853 --> 01:10:27,422
Yeah, why?

702
01:10:27,424 --> 01:10:29,824
     Tobey, I need to borrow
        your phone, okay?

703
01:10:29,826 --> 01:10:31,392
Beck, what's going on?

704
01:10:34,297 --> 01:10:35,496
           I'm sorry.

705
01:10:45,976 --> 01:10:46,975
                   This is nuts.

706
01:10:46,977 --> 01:10:52,413
   Miles, I know this is hard,
    but this is what kids...

707
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:54,148
How could this happen?

708
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:56,651
           This is what kids do.

709
01:10:56,653 --> 01:11:00,321
                  She'll be home
               when she's ready.

710
01:11:00,323 --> 01:11:02,156
                       Trust me.

711
01:11:32,389 --> 01:11:33,755
         <i> It's Beckett.</i>

712
01:11:33,757 --> 01:11:36,491
  Everyone's like freaking out
      and looking for you.

713
01:11:36,493 --> 01:11:38,126
        Don't freak out.

714
01:11:38,128 --> 01:11:39,294
       I'll explain later.

715
01:11:39,296 --> 01:11:41,863
   I just need you to meet me.

716
01:11:41,865 --> 01:11:44,332
     Can you please meet me?

717
01:11:44,334 --> 01:11:46,067
 <i> Why are you on Tobey's phone?</i>

718
01:11:46,069 --> 01:11:47,769
Jen?

719
01:11:47,771 --> 01:11:50,605
   I'm going to call you back
   in like two minutes, okay?

720
01:11:50,607 --> 01:11:52,206
       <i> No, don't hang up!</i>

721
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:08,556
           Hi sweetie.

722
01:12:08,558 --> 01:12:11,025
             Hi mom.

723
01:12:11,027 --> 01:12:17,031
     You look so beautiful.

724
01:12:17,033 --> 01:12:20,101
        What's going on?

725
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:02,910
Oh sorry.

726
01:13:02,912 --> 01:13:04,145
Is Jen home?

727
01:13:04,147 --> 01:13:08,249
                   I think she's
                    in her room.

728
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:37,044
            Jen? Jen!

729
01:13:37,046 --> 01:13:39,647
              Jen?

730
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:44,719
              Jen?

731
01:14:11,114 --> 01:14:12,213
          Hey, it's me.

732
01:14:12,215 --> 01:14:14,215
     <i> Tobey, they have Jen.</i>

733
01:14:14,217 --> 01:14:16,584
  <i> No, no, we have to help her.</i>

734
01:14:16,586 --> 01:14:19,020
     <i> I think they're going</i>
      <i> to kill her, Tobey.</i>

735
01:14:19,022 --> 01:14:20,621
       <i> Please believe me.</i>

736
01:14:20,623 --> 01:14:22,056
       <i> I'm really scared.</i>

737
01:14:22,058 --> 01:14:24,659
 Can you meet me by the tunnel?

738
01:14:24,661 --> 01:14:27,328
      Okay, when it's dark.

739
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:49,717
             <i> Hello?</i>

740
01:14:49,719 --> 01:14:50,785
      Hey Jen, it's Tobey.

741
01:14:50,787 --> 01:14:52,186
             Tobey?

742
01:14:52,188 --> 01:14:54,055
      <i> Is everything okay?</i>

743
01:14:54,057 --> 01:14:55,490
         Yeah, I'm fine.

744
01:14:55,492 --> 01:14:59,827
      Just here with mummy,
      bored out of my mind.

745
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:00,962
  <i> So you're sure you're okay?</i>

746
01:15:00,964 --> 01:15:02,029
             Mm-hmm.

747
01:15:02,031 --> 01:15:02,964
        <i> Okay, gotta go.</i>

748
01:15:02,966 --> 01:15:07,935
          Okay...freak.

749
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:44,038
             Tobey!

750
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,113
   Tobey, we have to go, okay?

751
01:15:52,115 --> 01:15:55,149
         Beckett, wait.

752
01:15:55,151 --> 01:15:59,654
          What's wrong?

753
01:16:01,123 --> 01:16:04,692
            Beckett.

754
01:16:04,694 --> 01:16:11,399
   They're gonna help you, Beck,
they'll take you somewhere safe.

755
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:26,213
Tobey cares about
you a great deal.

756
01:16:26,215 --> 01:16:29,951
Don't make this harder
on him than it has to be.

757
01:16:33,655 --> 01:16:38,426
         This is yours.

758
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:44,832
Come on.

759
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:53,541
           I'm sorry.

760
01:16:57,779 --> 01:17:00,014
              Stop!

761
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:12,086
             Pamela?

762
01:18:18,894 --> 01:18:21,128
             Pamela?

763
01:18:21,831 --> 01:18:24,231
           I can't wait anymore.

764
01:18:24,233 --> 01:18:25,332
   You didn't answer your phone.

765
01:18:25,334 --> 01:18:26,801
        We have to do something.

766
01:18:26,803 --> 01:18:30,838
I didn't answer my phone because
I was talking with Beckett.

767
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,139
                   Where is she?

768
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:33,407
I don't know.

769
01:18:33,409 --> 01:18:35,576
She didn't say, but she's safe
and she promised me

770
01:18:35,578 --> 01:18:37,211
that she would call you
later tonight.

771
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:40,014
                         Oh God.

772
01:18:40,016 --> 01:18:41,849
It's alright.

773
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:47,121
It's alright.

774
01:18:52,427 --> 01:18:56,597
              This is Beckett's.

775
01:18:56,599 --> 01:19:00,534
Well, I don't know
how it got here.

776
01:19:00,536 --> 01:19:01,769
Are you sure she
was wearing it?

777
01:19:01,771 --> 01:19:05,840
                           Yeah!

778
01:19:13,281 --> 01:19:18,719
                  I have so much
                   filing to do.

779
01:19:18,721 --> 01:19:24,925
Yeah, well, I guess I'll go
home and wait for her call.

780
01:19:27,462 --> 01:19:32,299
        If I get all this
        finished in time,

781
01:19:32,301 --> 01:19:37,938
       I'll come home and
       we'll be together.

782
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,807
       Alright, it's fine.

783
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:04,892
It's time.

784
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:12,066
              Jen?

785
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:40,094
  You're going to be just fine.

786
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:57,177
   I want you to know that you
    will be with me forever.

787
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:12,293
        No...no, please.

788
01:22:12,295 --> 01:22:15,829
        Somebody, please!

789
01:22:15,831 --> 01:22:18,198
              Help!

790
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:36,784
                         Shhh...

791
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:45,085
      I will not feed you.

792
01:23:54,195 --> 01:24:05,839
           Alverna...

793
01:24:05,841 --> 01:24:09,643
  When I left her in your care,
          she was pure.

794
01:24:09,645 --> 01:24:17,618
It's not my fault, she ran away.

795
01:24:22,091 --> 01:24:25,092
Your blood is
worthless to me now...

796
01:24:25,094 --> 01:24:35,269
but my blood, it can
help you live.

797
01:24:35,271 --> 01:24:37,671
Don't be afraid.

798
01:24:37,673 --> 01:24:41,075
Taste it...

799
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:57,257
             No, no.

800
01:25:15,778 --> 01:25:19,213
Join us.

801
01:25:49,577 --> 01:25:53,514
                    You're mine,
                    you're mine.

802
01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:52,606
Let's go.

803
01:27:29,944 --> 01:27:33,547
             Beckett, it's okay,
                 I'm right here.

804
01:27:33,549 --> 01:27:37,517
             Beckett, it's over.
