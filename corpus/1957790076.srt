00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,332
we need you to sign off on the count

190
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,434
for the deposit tomorrow.

191
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:32,638
- Thank you for the water, sister.

192
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:34,807
Is there anything else?

193
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:39,412
- Yeah, but um, I would like to talk to you in private.

194
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,548
- Well, uh, make an appointment,

195
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:44,383
just like everybody else.

196
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,152
You know, pastor's a busy man

197
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,955
and we can't make exceptions for just

198
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:49,789
anyone.

199
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:51,691
- Okay.

200
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:57,296
(Sister Brianna chuckles)

201
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,068
- I'll be so glad when Satan come to collect

202
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,035

203
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:05,137
and get out pastor's face.

204
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:08,341
- It's the loose ones running up on the men of the church

205
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,743
with the Jezebel ways. - Mm hmm.

206
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,946
I just wish the pastor would put her out of God's house.

207
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,381
- And you know what I wish you would do.

208
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,882
- Mm? - Shave that mustache

209
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,651
above your top lip

210
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:19,785
or at least line it up

211
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,354
to where it met your goatee.

212
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,223
- You are dis respectful harlot.

213
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,658
- Right?

214
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,159

222
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,442

223
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,276

Stop.

230
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,839
- Why you let her get to you like that?

231
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,174

00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,773

399
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,753
- Mm, Mila, beautiful name for a beautiful goddess.

400
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:01,754
(Mila giggles)

401
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,155
I'ma talk to her.

402
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:04,390

- [Mila] Probably go home.

406
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,228
We just got something to eat.

407
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:10,062
- Got something to eat, huh?

408
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:12,197
You ain't bring me none.

409
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,401
- Now why you standing over here looking all scared.

410
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,302
- I am not scared.

411
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:18,470
Just giving my girl a little privacy.

412
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,438
That's all.

413
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:20,372
- Oh, okay.

414
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:23,409
- Hmm.

415
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,312
- What you looking at?

416
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:28,347
- Where's the rest of it?

417
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:29,948
- The rest of what?

418
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,618
- Scripture?

419
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:36,422
- Oh, well that was the most powerful part to me.

420
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:37,856
I know God is with me

421
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:40,392
so that's no need to fear anything.

422
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,394
Everything guess it'll fall into place.

423
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,862
You know. - Hm.

424
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:44,930
What church you go to?

425
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,665
- (scoffs) Nah, shorty.

426
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,634
I don't get down like that.

427
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:53,005
Look, I believe in God or whatever, but that's about it.

428
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,840
But anyway, what's your name?

429
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,841

00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:56,842

431
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:57,843
- Oo, Haven,

432
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,646
I like that.

433
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,514
(Haven chuckles) It's different.

434
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,416
Do that mean, I can find safe space in you?

435
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,286
(Haven scoffs) Right?

436
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:08,554

- But you can call me Asa.

440
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,626
- Hmm.

441
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:16,128

442
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,062

443
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,398

456
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,122

460
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,495
so we can get together.

461
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:50,996
- That ain't no problem.

462
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:52,731

00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:06,518
- I have to go do the Lord's work.

732
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,719
That's what I call to do.

733
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:10,321
- But daddy, your first ministry is at home

734
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,223
and you're hardly here.

735
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,826
- Ouch.

736
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:15,960
(Hosea chuckling) - [Haven] Ouch.

737
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,362
- Using my own teachings against me.

738
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,830
- [Haven] Hm.

739
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,732
- I guess you have been paying attention in church.

740
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:21,933
- Have I, now?

741
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:22,767
- Uh.

742
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:25,336
How about this?

743
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:26,805
After this weekend,

744
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,373
I'll take some time off

745
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,809
and the three of us can hang out.

746
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:31,810
- The three of us?

747
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,279
- Yeah, you, me, Shaunie.

748
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,613
- I'll pass.

749
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:36,548
- Come on now.

750
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,415
Why you gotta pass, baby?

751
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:38,349
- I'll pass you.

752
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:40,685
You go on to your ministry, dad.

753
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:44,923
I'll see, when you get back, safe travels.

754
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:48,426
Will you be back tomorrow or whenever?

755
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:49,360
It doesn't matter.

756
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,695
Love you.

757
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:52,864
- I love you too. - mm-hmm.

758
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:55,700
- Father, son.

759
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:59,170
Holy ghost. (both laughing)

760
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,405
All right.

761
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,840
Look when I get back, I'll take you shopping.

762
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,141
All right? - Mm-hmm.

763
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:04,042
- All right?

764
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:05,043
Praise the Lord.

765
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:06,177
- Hallelujah. - Hallelujah.

766
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:07,011
Let's go.

767
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:19,224
(slow melodic music)

768
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,561
(door knocking)

769
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:24,963
- [Haven] Coming!

770
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:33,438
- Hey, best friend! - Hey, girl!

771
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:38,143
(door knocking) (Asa speaking faintly)

772
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:39,344
- [Fangaz] It was you, bruh.

773
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:40,278
Should have left your ass in the car.

774
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,848
(door knocking repeatedly)

775
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:48,620
(knocking continues)

776
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,488
- Nice house.

777
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:52,657
- Girl, I can smell that chicken all the way out here.

778
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:53,925
- Uh-uh.

779
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:55,293
- What is this?

780
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,528
- What?

781
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:57,595
You too good to let a nigga up in your house?

782
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:58,863
- Aye, bruh, don't. - What?

783
00:29:58,863 --> 00:29:59,697
- Don't do that.

784
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:00,865
- Listen little ugly.

785
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:01,800
It ain't got nothing to do with me

786
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,934
being better than anybody.

787
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:04,169
It's a simple fact that

788
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:05,603
my dad don't even play these type of games

789
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,105
and Mila,

790
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,374
you know what would happen if he came back here right now.

791
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,342
- Girl, that's not gonna happen.

792
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,711
The last thing your daddy gonna do is come back here

793
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:16,214
with Shaunie in the car. (Haven scoff)

794
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:17,816
- What do you mean with Shaunie in the car?

795
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,051
My daddy went to go do ministry.

796
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:21,586
- Ministry?

797
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,421
Is that what they callin' sneaky linkin' these days?

798
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:27,225
'Cause our show did see them get on I-75 on my way here.

799
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:28,459
- Yeah, we did.

800
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,365
- Okay, come on, y'all.

801
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:35,767
Hey, best friend. - Hm, best friend.

802
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,802
- Smell like chicken, mm.

803
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,705
- Hey, you. (smooth jazz music)

804
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:41,573
- Hey, you.

805
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:43,575
- Good to see you.

806
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:44,375
- It is.

807
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,747
- It's nice place you got.

808
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:50,715
- Thank you.

809
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:55,954
- After you.

810
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:58,456
(Haven sighs)

811
00:30:58,456 --> 00:30:59,524
- The chicken. - Man, that shit

812
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,692
better be good, the way you keep

813
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,995
talking about it. - It is! I promise you.

814
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,233
- What is wrong with you?

815
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,667
- What?

816
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,069
- Why you bringing these strange men up in my house, Mila?

817
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:12,937
You know, we don't get down like that.

818
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:14,239
- [Mila] They're cool people.

819
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:15,540
- [Haven] Says who?

820
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,575
- I've been talking to Fangaz for weeks.

821
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:18,509
- So.

822
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,078
- He's cool and so is Trouble.

823
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:22,146
He asked about you the other day?

824
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:23,781
- No, he did not.

825
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:25,083
That man doesn't know much about me from

826
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:27,418
the conversation we had three weeks ago.

827
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:29,020
- He did too.

828
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,389
And judging by that smile you're trying to hide

829
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,991
I can tell you glad about it.

830
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:33,858
(Haven mocking Mila)

831
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:34,692
Mm-hmm.

832
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:37,829
- Oo. - Okay.

833
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:41,833
So y'all can take a seat at the island.

834
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,535
I didn't know that we were having extra company,

835
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:48,740
but there should be enough for everybody.

836
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,074
- Yeah.

837
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,410
- Ooh. - You know, you know.

838
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,444
- You not even like that, bro.

839
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:54,746
- Right? He's faking.

840
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,713
- [Mila] Don't to him.

841
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:56,848
- Bruh, stop playing me, bruh.

842
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,616
- I've been teaching him, okay?

843
00:31:58,616 --> 00:31:59,984
- [Haven] Mm, I know a phony when I see one.

844
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:00,752
- A real gentleman.

845
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,353
Chivalry.

846
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:03,788
- Spell chivalry. (Haven laughing)

847
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:05,023
- [Haven] Spell it. Spell it!

848
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:08,426
- C-H-ilvery. (group laughing)

849
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:09,928
- Shut up.

850
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:10,895
- [Haven] I'm surprised you got the first two, right?

851
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,096
- Oh whatever. (girls laughing)

852
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,464
- Makes my life, I ain't gonna hold you.

853
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:14,565
- [Mila] Mm-hmm.

854
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:16,701
- You got some hot sauce, right?

855
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:18,403
- Yes. - [Fangaz] Okay, let's go.

856
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:19,404
- You don't see the color of my skin?

857
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:20,638
Of course we got hot sauce.

858
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:21,306
- [Asa] Say that. - Just checkin'.

859
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:22,106
Just checkin'.

860
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,207
(Haven laughing)

861
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:25,443
- You not even gonna need it.

862
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,645
- Oh, it's that good? - Mm-hmm.

863
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:28,546
- [Asa] Thank you.

864
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:30,214
- [Haven] Of course.

865
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:32,450
- Okay.

866
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,351
I just feel it. (plate hits countertop)

867
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:34,919
(Asa laughing)

868
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,555
- [Asa] God damn. - [Haven] You're welcome.

869
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:39,824
(Mila laughing)

870
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:41,592
- [Asa] I mean, she have to do all but.

871
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:43,061
(both laughing)

872
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:46,464
- Hold on, my man's can't show me up, like that.

873
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,266
- Show him how to do it right.

874
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,600
- Oh, now he trying to be a old gentleman.

875
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,269
- [Asa] Come on now, this regular.

876
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:52,670
- Y'all wanna be us, so bad. - [Asa] This regular.

877
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,972
- Oh, really? - I try.

878
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:58,776
- I promise you. (Mila laughing)

879
00:32:58,776 --> 00:32:59,610
- It's missing something.

880
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:00,578
- Mm, okay.

881
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,747
- Shut up. - Hot sauce.

882
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,215
- Okay.

883
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:05,316
- [Mila] This chicken good.

884
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,517
- Okay. - Mm-hmm.

885
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:07,185
- [Fangaz] Need some hot sauce but.

886
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,586
(Asa laughing)

887
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:09,754
- You know, put little the mm. - A little something.

888
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:12,523
(Haven laughing)

889
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:22,300
- Stop doing that.

890
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,568
- Doing what?

891
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:25,470
- Pulling on your clothes.

892
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,671
- I'm not.

893
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,505
- You are.

894
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,311
Why you got that kiddie portion of food on your plate?

895
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:36,547
- I'm just not that hungry, that's all.

896
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,588
- I'm gonna break you out of that shell.

897
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:44,922
Sooner or later.

898
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,999
- Can I get some hot sauce or something?

899
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:55,867
What?

900
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,001
- Is it good?

901
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:58,069
Would you like something to drink too?

902
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,570
- Mm-hmm.

903
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,205
- It's all right, still waiting on hot sauce though.

904
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,807
(Mila laughing)

905
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,008
- You don't need it.

906
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:05,877
- Trouble, would you like something to drink?

907
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:06,711
- Water?

908
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:08,980
- I'm saying, though you,

909
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,416
see us all sitting out eating all this nice ass shit

910
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:13,217
and the only person that you gonna offer something to drink

911
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,385
is this fool?

912
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,653
- [Asa] Bruh.

913
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:16,854
For real?

914
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:20,291
- First of all, don't cuss in my house.

915
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:21,626
Secondly,

916
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,127
the reason why I didn't ask you

917
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:25,163
is because we don't have enough Proactive cocktail

918
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:26,564
to clean up that face of yours

919
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,099
from the inside and out so. (all laughing)

920
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,500
- [Asa] God damn.

921
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,869
- Okay.

922
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:34,372
I told you to stop coming from my boo like that.

923
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:36,140
- (chuckling) And now see that's why

924
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,742
she gonna be my baby mama.

925
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,577
Keep on taking up for me like that, girl.

926
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,145
Keep it up, keep it up, now.

927
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:42,580
- This guy.

928
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,615
- [Haven] I hope you were gonna get one from overseas, Mi.

929
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:45,783
- Get what from overseas?

930
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:47,251
- A baby.

931
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,319
Because you having one with that one right there

932
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:52,723
is not the move. (all laughing)

933
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:53,991
- [Asa] Pull up.

934
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:56,027
- (laughing) It's funny.

935
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:59,030
- Shut your fat ass up, bitch!

936
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,131
- Say, bruh.

937
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:01,065
- What?

938
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:02,033
- Now, you can't do that.

939
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:02,967
- What?

940
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,202
- What you not about to do

941
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:06,437
is come for that one right there.

942
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,272
- So you taking up her? - Yeah!

943
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,507
- All right.

944
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,042
- This right here is a lifetime bond.

945
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,877
You just got here.

946
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,146
You not about to come from my sister.

947
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:16,414
- All right.

948
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:18,349
- I'm gonna go. - Haven.

949
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:21,586
Bruh, you see that?

950
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:23,121
That's some foul shit, bruh.

951
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,722
- What, bruh?

952
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:26,290
- Call her a bitch in her house.

953
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,358
- You on her side, too?

954
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:28,793
- Definitely.

955
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:29,927
- Nigga, we were supposed to be boys, though.

956
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:31,462
(Mila sucks teeth) - We boys.

957
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,599
We are boys but that's why I can tell you why you wrong.

958
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,200
That shit a foul, bruh.

959
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,668
- Let me go check on her.

960
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:38,836
- Nah, let me.

961
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:43,074
- Second door to the left.

962
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:44,809
- Captain save a, hmm.

963
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,478
- [Asa] Get your mans. - Shut up.

964
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,681
- We gonna talk. - Why don't you say that?

965
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:53,784
- Because she ain't gimme no hot sauce and I'm still upset.

966
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:54,619
What?

967
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,489
- I wanna see you. (lofi music)

968
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:01,926
(Haven faintly praying through tears)

969
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:04,762
God, let me know that you're here.

970
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:08,799
(crying)

971
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:11,903
- Hey, hey.

972
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:15,606
Hey, hey, shh.

973
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:17,341
Come here, shh.

974
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,176
It's okay.

975
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:20,778
It's okay, it's okay.

976
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:22,547
Relax.

977
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,050
Relax.

978
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,485
(breathing heavily) (Asa shushing)

979
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:30,288
(whispering faintly)

980
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,023
Come on, breathe with me, breathe with me.

981
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,124
Breathe with me.

982
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:34,425
Breathe with me.

983
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:36,961
(both taking deep breathes)

984
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:37,795
Come on.

985
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:42,934
He, he gonna be him.

986
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,068
He ain't mean it.

987
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:45,403
He didn't mean it.

988
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:46,237
- Yes he did.

989
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:48,239
- No, he didn't.

990
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,207
Look, no he didn't. - Yes he did.

991
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,841
- No, he didn't.

992
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:52,243
He didn't.

993
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:53,978
He didn't, I promise.

994
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:58,583
Now you may now see it right now but

995
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,151
you gonna get over this.

996
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:02,553
Fangaz ain't mean that stuff he was saying.

997
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,889
You just crushed his little manhood.

998
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,091
(Haven laughing) That's it.

999
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:09,427
About his future child and (chuckling)

1000
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:10,695
that sh,

1001
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:13,331
I mean, that stuff was low key funny.

1002
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,834
(both laughing)

1003
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:18,703
- Right? - Just a little bit.

1004
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:19,537
- Yeah.

1005
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:21,205
Just relax.

1006
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:23,040
Don't worry about him.

1007
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,512
What are um,

1008
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:29,747
what are those?

1009
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:33,484
- Uh, my writings on the wall?

1010
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:34,785
- Yeah.

1011
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:37,722
- Um, those are my prayer requests.

1012
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:42,093
- That's like that lady from the movie

1013
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,762
where she sat in closet the whole time.

1014
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:47,164
She actually told him how to pray.

1015
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:48,232
- War Room? - War Room.

1016
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:49,333
(Haven laughing)

1017
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:50,568
That's it.

1018
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,570
And my grandma, she took me to it

1019
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,538
as soon as it came out.

1020
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:55,973
I didn't, I didn't want to go

1021
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:57,275
but

1022
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,176
she wasn't having that.

1023
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:01,412
- Sounds like she don't play.

1024
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:03,581
Not even the radio. (Haven laughing)

1025
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:04,815
- You gone see.

1026
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:07,818
- Mm.

1027
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:12,223
I wish I had someone to spend time with me like that.

1028
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:13,658
You're lucky.

1029
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:17,261
- I mean, from the pictures on the hall look like

1030
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:19,263
you had a pretty good life to me.

1031
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:20,097
- Oh.

1032
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,635
Material things don't move me.

1033
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:31,142
My dad spends all his time to the church and everyone else.

1034
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,980
He doesn't really have much time for me.

1035
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:40,751
Those material things,

1036
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,953
they don't move me.

1037
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:46,290
He uses those to fill the void.

1038
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,124
I guess.

1039
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,864
- Where you're old lady?

1040
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:54,899
- Huh?

1041
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:55,733
- Your mom.

1042
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:56,567
Where your mom?

1043
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:57,401
- Oh uh,

1044
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,004
yeah.

1045
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:03,741
She died when I was three.

1046
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:10,014
- I'm sorry to hear that.

1047
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:10,881
- Yeah.

1048
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:12,316
What about yours?

1049
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:17,388
- She died house two.

1050
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:18,222
Oh.

1051
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,094
I'm sorry to hear that.

1052
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:29,567
(sighs) I guess we have more in common than we thought.

1053
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:31,936
- Yeah, let's get me at this war room

1054
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:33,337
(both laughing) (cell phone ringing)

1055
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:34,672
before I turn it to one of them ladies

1056
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,240
(Haven laughing) from the movie.

1057
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,909
(cellphone ringing) - Oh shoot, um.

1058
00:39:38,909 --> 00:39:40,444
My dad's calling.

1059
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:42,413
Okay so if I don't answer, he's gonna send

1060
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:44,115
Mrs. Easley from the church to come check on me.

1061
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:45,383
- Okay, I'll give a little privacy.

1062
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,584
- No, no, no, stay. (cellphone ringing)

1063
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:47,585
- All right.

1064
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,321
- Hello?

1065
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:52,623
And before you ask daddy, yes I'm okay.

1066
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:53,858
- [Shaunie] Did you tell her yet?

1067
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:56,193
- [Hosea] (sighs) Not yet. - Hello?

1068
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:57,928
- [Shaunie] Well, you better hurry up.

1069
00:39:57,928 --> 00:39:59,397
- Daddy. - [Shaunie] We don't have long

1070
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,399
and I refuse to walk down this aisle with a big stomach.

1071
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,633
- [Hosea] Yeah, yeah, well, um.

1072
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:03,868
- [Shaunie] I'm not bringing this baby

1073
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,403
into this world, unmarried, Hosea.

1074
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,505
(Asa clears throat) - [Hosea] Baby.

1075
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:08,339
I got you.

1076
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:12,643
(phone beeps)

1077
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:14,245
- Haven.

1078
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,079
You okay?

1079
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:18,883
Haven.

1080
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:21,485
You all right?

1081
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,559
(door knocking)

1082
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,430
- Yo.

1083
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:35,599
Yo, Haven.

1084
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,302
Haven.

1085
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:39,603
Yo, real quick uh,

1086
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,105
I just wanted to apologize about earlier.

1087
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,406
That was my fault, for real, for real.

1088
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:44,241
- (scoffs) It's fine.

1089
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:45,209
You're good.

1090
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:55,219
Uh, Mila, do you have any of that famous juice of yours?

1091
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:57,521
- Uh, are you sure?

1092
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:59,757

1105
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,895

Chop sent the hit.

1259

1269
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:33,110
Chinirika was Trouble's mama's best friend.

1270
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:35,612
She told him everything, bruh.

1271
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:39,149
- That's crazy as fuck. - I know, bruh.

1272
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:41,818
- What the fuck? - [Fangaz] Yeah.

1273
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:44,454
- Yo, you straight?

1274
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:46,323
- Yeah.

1275
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:48,959
I'm good. - All right.

1276
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:52,262
- I'm just think about tonight.

1277
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,031
- All right, bro, so uh,

1278
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:55,098
you know we gotta be on our shit tonight, right?

1279
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:57,267
- Bruh, don't start that shit.

1280
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,101
- I'm just saying, bro.

1281
00:48:58,101 --> 00:48:59,903
- Man, chill.

1282
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,771
Don't start that shit.

1283
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,306
I told Shea.

1284
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:03,573
Damn. - All I'm saying is, bro

1285
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:05,509
we can't afford no slip ups. - I got it.

1286
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:07,144
- All right.

1287
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:10,213
Shit, if you ready then let's be out.

1288
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,019
♪ See, had a dollar and dream

1289
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:17,955
♪ Nigga moved to Atlanta

1290
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,256

1293
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:29,066
- [Asa] Man, I hope there ain't a lot of people here.

1294
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:31,668
- [Fangaz] It's a church, bruh.

1295
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:35,439
- Hey, you know, you need to put

1296
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:36,840
your good boy act on, right?

1297
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,009
- Yeah, whatever.

1298
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:40,844
Miss me with all that.

1299
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:43,580
I'ma do what I'm supposed to do.

1300
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:46,683
Just make sure you do what you're supposed to.

1301
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:49,019
- (scoffs) All right.

1302
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:50,253
You ready? - Yeah.

1303
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:51,888
- I'm glad you took them goofy ass shades off.

1304
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:54,992
In the house of the Lord. (both chuckling)

1305
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:57,127
- And it's my favorite scripture in the bible

1306
00:49:57,127 --> 00:50:00,697
because he went through great test.

1307
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:02,432
- [Women] That's right. - But he kept the faith.

1308
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:03,967
- [Women] Amen.

1309
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:05,769
- The race is not given to the swift nor the mighty.

1310
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:06,970
- Mm.

1311
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,372
- But to those who endure to end.

1312
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:09,606
- Glory to god. - Amen.

1313
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:10,807
- [All] Amen. - Amen.

1314
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:12,376
I will see you next week.

1315
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:13,577
I love you.

1316
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:15,679
Love on somebody on your way out, all right?

1317
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,883
(indistinct group chatter)

1318
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:20,984
- [Mila] Bye.

1319
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:24,855
- [Haven] Oh, my God, it's time, okay, okay.

1320
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:25,956
- Stop fidgeting, you look amazing.

1321
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:27,424
- Okay. - You look amazing

1322
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:29,226
and Trouble's gonna love it. - [Haven] You think so?

1323
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:30,494
- [Mila] Yes.

1324
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:32,562
- [Haven] All right, let's go, let's go.

1325
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:34,464
(Haven clears throat)

1326
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:35,399
- [Asa] What's up, gorgeous.

1327
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:36,733
- [Fangaz] Hey, beautiful.

1328
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:38,835
- Hey handsome.

1329
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:40,470
- I love this look on you.

1330
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:43,840
- Thank you, yeah, you know, um

1331
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,143
Mila's starting to do her little hair braiding thing

1332
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,211
and now I'm her walking guinea pig.

1333
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,279
(both laughing)

1334
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:51,448
But, uh, I kind of like it.

1335
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:52,682
- Yeah, it's fire.

1336
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:54,718
It's fire but that's not what I mean.

1337
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:55,952
- What do you mean?

1338
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:58,889
- I love this look of confidence on you.

1339
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,491
- How come you don't ever say nothing like that to me?

1340
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:02,559
- (sucks teeth) First of all, baby,

1341
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,760
that's corny.

1342
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,729
All right, baby, I'm a big gangster.

1343
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:06,897
Big gangster.

1344
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:07,898
- You get on my nerves

1345
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:08,832
so bad. - The biggest gangster.

1346
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:09,699
I'm the biggest gangster.

1347
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:10,700
Yeah, he'll tell you.

1348
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,669
He can vouch for that, yeah.

1349
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:13,904
For real.

1350
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,238
- [Mila] You get on my nerves so bad.

1351
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,741
(Haven giggling) - This guy.

1352
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,342
- Are you ready? - Yeah.

1353
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:20,310
- Are you sure?

1354
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:21,711
- (sucks teeth) Yes.

1355
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:22,646
Okay, just.

1356
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,850
Okay. (Haven giggling)

1357
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:27,684
Daddy.

1358
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:30,787
- Hey baby.

1359
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:32,222
- Hey, thank you.

1360
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:34,925
- (chuckling) Who's this?

1361
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,827
- Okay, um, daddy.

1362
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:38,328
This is Asa. - Mm.

1363
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:40,864
- Asa, this is my dad,

1364
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:42,165
Pastor Reynolds.

1365
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:43,266
- Nice to meet you young, man.

1366
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,734
- Nice to meet you, sir. - Mm-hmm.

1367
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:46,903
- So, uh, you go to school with the girls.

1368
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:48,205
- I do.

1369
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:49,873
Um, we actually take a few classes together.

1370
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:51,708
(Shaunie clears throat)

1371
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:53,410
- Excuse me, sorry.

1372
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:54,911
My throat is dry.

1373
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:58,548
I'm gonna go get some water, I'll be right back.

1374
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:01,985
- So, uh,

1375
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:04,754
how's your grades, Asa?

1376
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:06,490
- Daddy, you don't have to do that right now.

1377
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,958
- It's cool, beautiful.

1378
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,459
It's cool, I don't mind answering his questions.

1379
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,027
I mean, if it was my only daughter

1380
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:13,497
bringing me some guy I never met before,

1381
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:15,699
I'd probably be the same way.

1382
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:17,634
But to answer your question, sir,

1383
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:20,737
I've been an honor student since the ninth grade,

1384
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:24,307
before then I was a little rebellious acting out.

1385
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:26,176
'Cause I missed my mom, - Mm hmm.

1386
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:29,746
- But my granna sat me down and explained to me

1387
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:31,548
how important school was.

1388
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:32,415
- Hmm.

1389
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:33,817
- Ever since then

1390
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,485
got it together.

1391
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:37,687
- (chuckling) That's nice.

1392
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:39,189
Nice. I like that.

1393
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:41,424
We're gonna have to have you over to the house for dinner.

1394
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:42,592
Me and you can talk. - [Asa] Yeah.

1395
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:43,793
- Get to know each other a little bit more.

1396
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:46,029
- Yeah. - Yeah, I like that.

1397
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:48,899
- Well, I ain't gonna keep you, baby girl.

1398
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:50,700
I know you got to go do your thing.

1399
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,968
- Yeah. - All right.

1400
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:53,036
You don't try to stay out too late.

1401
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:55,138
- I won't, we'll be home on time.

1402
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:55,972
- Mm-hmm.

1403
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:56,907
- Nice to meet you.

1404
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:57,741
- Same.

1405
00:52:57,741 --> 00:52:58,842
- Asa.

1406
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,510
- Pastor Reynolds. - Hmm.

1407
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:02,546
- See you later, daddy.

1408
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:03,480
- All right, baby.

1409
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,115
- All right, all right, preach.

1410
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:08,351
- Yeah. (Haven laughing)

1411
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,619
- [Haven] That kind of went okay.

1412
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:10,820
- [Asa] It was good. - [Haven] Slightly.

1413
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:13,256
You know. - [Asa] It was good.

1414
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:16,860
(indistinct group chatter)

1415
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:31,508
- Oh.

1416
00:53:31,508 --> 00:53:33,210
- Yo, why you leave like that?

1417
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,546
- Oh baby, I told you I was thirsty.

1418
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:37,981
I had to go get a drink of water.

1419
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:39,950
My mouth was dry.

1420
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:41,218
You would've heard me

1421
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,720
if you were listening to me and instead of Haven.

1422
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,222
- Don't start with that.

1423
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,824
You know when my daughter is concerned, it's about her.

1424
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:49,226
- (scoffs) Yeah. - All right.

1425
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,460
- Yeah, you right.

1426
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:53,330
- But what about when this baby gets here? Hm?

1427
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:55,365
Is this baby gonna get that same treatment?

1428
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:57,734
Hm? And does, does Haven even know?

1429
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,936
- When this baby gets here,

1430
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:03,974
I'm going to treat her the same way.

1431
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:05,809
- Mm-hmm, you better.

1432
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:07,477
'Cause one thing I won't have

1433
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:10,180
is my baby feeling inferior to Haven.

1434
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:11,481
You don't have to worry about that.

1435
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:12,716
- Uh-huh, okay.

1436
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:16,286
It's not the right time.

1437
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:17,921
No, no, when you're gonna tell her?

1438
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,523
You gonna wait 'til I'm pushing or something?

1439
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:22,892
- I got it, baby, okay?

1440
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:25,629
I promise you, I'm gonna tell her.

1441
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:26,463
- Okay.

1442
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:32,302
- Who was that on the phone, when I came in?

1443
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:33,903
- Oh, nobody.

01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:48,877
We both know it could have been much worse.

1799
01:10:48,877 --> 01:10:51,280
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

1800
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:55,117
- Have you heard from Asa?

1801
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:57,620
- No ma'am and they gave me strict instructions

1802
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:58,921
not to call him.

1803
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:02,958
I know that the good Lord is tired of me

1804
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:06,729

1805
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:08,631
- You and me both.

1806
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:10,165

1811
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:26,415

1815
01:11:33,222 --> 01:11:35,924

You gonna get my great-granddaughter all upset.

1820
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:45,034

1821
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:46,402

01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:48,237
I ain't never been wrong yet.

1823
01:11:48,237 --> 01:11:52,541
- [Haven] Oh really? (both laughing)

1824
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:57,413

You know, Asa, told me everything.

1830
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:07,389
- Did he?

1831
01:12:07,389 --> 01:12:08,657
- Yes, ma'am.

1832
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:09,892

You know the routine.

01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:52,788
- What the fuck are you doing here?

1877
01:14:55,457 --> 01:14:57,693
- Since you pastor and all,

1879
01:15:01,063 --> 01:15:02,798
(intense music)

1880
01:15:02,798 --> 01:15:04,766
I don't have time for this shit, man.

1881
01:15:04,766 --> 01:15:06,502
- Nigga, you got all the time in the world.

1882
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:08,003
- [Hosea] Get out.

1883

01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:12,674
You was smart as fuck,

1885
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:14,776
setting up shop at church.

1886
01:15:14,776 --> 01:15:19,681
God damn, I wish I would've thought of that shit.

1887
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:21,283
Especially after you uh,

1888
01:15:21,283 --> 01:15:22,551

1889
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:25,454
after what happened with your baby mama.

1890
01:15:26,622 --> 01:15:30,392
And I never took you for a family guy either.

1891
01:15:31,994 --> 01:15:33,195
But you did a good job

1892
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:36,965

01:15:36,965 --> 01:15:39,001
As fine as her, mama.

1895
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:42,671
Get the fuck off me, nigga.

- Fuck you nigga, fuck your daughter!

1898
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:48,043
You think I was gonna let you steal my shit

1899
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:50,212

1900
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:53,315

Trapper turned preacher caught red-handed.

1948

Charges remain unseen. - It's gonna be all right.

Just calm down.

1956
01:18:59,468 --> 01:19:02,370
It's just a misunderstanding, it's okay.

It's all right, calm down.

I can't.

1966
01:19:20,689 --> 01:19:24,326
He's been an dope dealing liar this whole time.

1967
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:25,160
- Just relax.

1968
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:27,195
- You listen to me.

1969
01:19:27,195 --> 01:19:28,130
Your daddy,

1970
01:19:29,364 --> 01:19:31,767
he might be a lot of things,

1971
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,603

1976
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:44,813
my daughter.

1977
01:19:44,813 --> 01:19:46,414
Not that man.

1978
01:19:46,414 --> 01:19:48,583
That man is Satan himself.

1979
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:53,188
You see, my gift of discernment is sharper.

1980
01:19:53,188 --> 01:19:55,257
I can read anybody.

1981
01:19:55,257 --> 01:19:58,360
From the moment I laid my eyes on that negro,

1982
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,495
I knew he wasn't no good.

1983
01:20:00,495 --> 01:20:04,065
I begged and I begged and I begged her to cut him loose,

1984
01:20:04,065 --> 01:20:06,902
but he had a hold on her so tight.

1985
01:20:08,069 --> 01:20:10,071
It almost suffocated me.

1986
01:20:11,406 --> 01:20:12,974
And then

1987
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:13,875
she told me

1988
01:20:15,243 --> 01:20:16,178
for my family,

1989
01:20:16,178 --> 01:20:17,012
but baby,

1990
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:22,417
the night you showed up on my porch,

1991
01:20:22,417 --> 01:20:25,153
I promise you, girl was like,

1992
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:29,424
like granna had seen my angel straight from heaven.

1993
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:36,198
- Thank you, granna.

1994
01:20:37,766 --> 01:20:38,834
- Your mother

1995
01:20:40,268 --> 01:20:44,005
is proud of the woman that you are becoming baby.

1996
01:20:46,908 --> 01:20:51,613
- I can't believe your father wanted to kill me.

1997
01:20:51,613 --> 01:20:54,015
Why? I had nothing to do with anything.

1998
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:56,318
- That nigga ain't my daddy.

1999
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:59,387
Just some nigga that nutted in my mama.

2000
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:00,188
That's it.

2001
01:21:01,556 --> 01:21:04,693
Haven, the day that Chop showed me that picture of you

2002
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:06,962
I literally was tripping.

2003
01:21:06,962 --> 01:21:08,196
I just met you.

2004
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:12,534
And he talking 'bout, get close to you.

2005
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:14,202
Get you to trust me.

2006
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:18,340
I was supposed to bring you into him.

2007
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:23,845
- Were you gonna kill me?

2008
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:28,116
- Honestly,

2009
01:21:29,484 --> 01:21:30,952
I was just, I was just gonna listen to his orders,

2010
01:21:30,952 --> 01:21:33,288
but Haven something changed.

2011
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:36,625
Everything changed, Haven.

2012
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:39,060
Look,

2013
01:21:40,795 --> 01:21:43,164
it's not just because we had sex.

2014
01:21:43,164 --> 01:21:47,002
It's that conversation we had in your closet.

2015
01:21:47,002 --> 01:21:50,071
I knew you were a real deal

2016
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:52,007
and I understand why you were sent to me.

2017
01:21:52,007 --> 01:21:53,141
I get it, now.

2018
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:56,077
Look, it may have started out,

2019
01:21:56,077 --> 01:21:58,647
by some plan the enemy started,

2020
01:22:01,216 --> 01:22:03,184
but God turned it around for us.

2021
01:22:03,184 --> 01:22:04,686
- Hey, hallelujah!

2022
01:22:05,687 --> 01:22:08,056
Okay. Yes, grand baby. - Grandma.

2023
01:22:08,056 --> 01:22:09,257
- Oh, baby,

2024
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:10,759
I'm sorry.

2025
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:14,195
You know how I get what God shows himself approved.

2026
01:22:14,195 --> 01:22:15,030
I'ma hush.

2027
01:22:18,967 --> 01:22:22,337
- Is that what you' trying to tell me that night.

2028
01:22:22,337 --> 01:22:23,171
- Yeah.

2029
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:27,042
- I meant everything I said Haven.

2030
01:22:27,042 --> 01:22:27,943
I meant it.

2031
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:34,249
I just hope that you can forgive me.

2032
01:22:35,517 --> 01:22:37,519
- Okay, what about Chop? - [Asa] Look.

2033
01:22:37,519 --> 01:22:39,087
- What if he tries to kill me?

2034
01:22:39,087 --> 01:22:41,122
- You ain't gonna have to worry about him no more.

2035
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:41,957
Okay?

2036
01:22:43,124 --> 01:22:46,227
My three girls are protected.

2037
01:22:46,227 --> 01:22:47,062
All right?

2038
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:49,264
- What?

2039
01:22:49,264 --> 01:22:50,799
What are you talking about three girls.

2040
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:51,666
- Granna.

2041
01:22:51,666 --> 01:22:53,001
You.

2042
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:54,803
And my little princess baking in there.

2043
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:56,338
(Haven chuckles)

2044
01:22:56,338 --> 01:22:57,439
- And here you go.

2045
01:22:57,439 --> 01:22:59,240
How do you know it's a girl?

2046
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:02,077
- I don't, but granna said it, so

2047
01:23:02,077 --> 01:23:04,045
it must be law. - [Haven] Not granna.

2048
01:23:04,045 --> 01:23:05,046
(all laughing)

2049
01:23:05,046 --> 01:23:06,881
- We just gonna run with it.

2050
01:23:06,881 --> 01:23:09,651
We just gonna go with it but look,

2051
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:11,886
we gonna start a new life.

2052
01:23:11,886 --> 01:23:12,721
Us three.

2053
01:23:15,423 --> 01:23:16,257
Our love,

2054
01:23:17,192 --> 01:23:18,026
honesty,

2055
01:23:19,561 --> 01:23:20,395
respect,

2056
01:23:21,596 --> 01:23:24,933
all that other stuff you were telling me.

2057
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:26,835
It's over now.

2058
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:27,669
Okay?

2059
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:33,475
All right?

2060
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:35,910
Don't worry.

2061
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:36,745
I got you.

2062
01:23:38,113 --> 01:23:38,947
Okay?

2063
01:23:40,148 --> 01:23:42,817
(police sirens)

2064
01:23:45,453 --> 01:23:47,055
- [Guard] Reynolds.

2065
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:07,909
- [Kidnapped girl] Get off me!

2066
01:24:07,909 --> 01:24:09,377
What is going on?

2067
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:11,046
Please get off of me!

2068
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:12,313
No!

2069
01:24:12,313 --> 01:24:12,981
- [Kidnapper] Ah, shut the fuck up.

2070
01:24:12,981 --> 01:24:15,417
(gunshots)

2071
01:24:15,417 --> 01:24:17,419
(bible thuds)

2072
01:24:17,419 --> 01:24:20,922
(Hosea exclaims)

2073
01:24:20,922 --> 01:24:22,190
- Love you.

2074
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:23,658
- I love you too.

2075
01:24:23,658 --> 01:24:24,926
(intense music)

2076
01:24:24,926 --> 01:24:28,930
(inmates speaking indistinctly)

2077
01:24:46,414 --> 01:24:49,184
(dramatic music)

2078
01:24:58,560 --> 01:24:59,494
- You good?

2079
01:25:04,232 --> 01:25:07,402
(sighs) I'm so disgusted by these charges.

2080
01:25:07,402 --> 01:25:10,238
I won't even beat around the bush.

2081
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:12,941
You're going down.

2082
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:15,443
And if I have anything to do with it,

2083
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:17,946
it's gonna be for a long time.

2084
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:20,215
- Whatever, man

2085
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:23,384
- I've seen people get arrested for

2086
01:25:23,384 --> 01:25:26,054
almost everything under the sun.

2087
01:25:27,489 --> 01:25:30,258
So the drugs and the murders don't really surprise me.

2088
01:25:30,258 --> 01:25:33,261
But what doesn't surprise me is that you

2089
01:25:33,261 --> 01:25:36,898
have the audacity to play with God

2090
01:25:36,898 --> 01:25:39,834
by claiming to be a servant of his.

2091
01:25:45,573 --> 01:25:47,342
You give good pastors

2092
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:51,813
who are really about this life,

2093
01:25:52,714 --> 01:25:53,615
a bad name.

2094
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:57,418
- I don't know what you're talking about.

2095
01:25:57,418 --> 01:25:58,786
Those things that you found,

2096
01:25:58,786 --> 01:26:00,522
don't belong to me.

2097
01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:02,457
And I don't know how it got there.

2098
01:26:02,457 --> 01:26:03,758
All right?

2099
01:26:03,758 --> 01:26:05,026
As a man of God,

2100
01:26:05,026 --> 01:26:08,696
as a man of the cloth I would never, never,

2101
01:26:08,696 --> 01:26:11,666
never do anything to disrespect God.

2102
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:12,500
- Wow!

2103
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:14,769
Unbelievable.

2104
01:26:16,804 --> 01:26:18,606
I stand in front of my congregation

2105
01:26:18,606 --> 01:26:21,943
every Sunday and Wednesday doing my best

2106
01:26:24,245 --> 01:26:27,649
to lead God's people back to him

2107
01:26:27,649 --> 01:26:30,585
and pray that I don't do anything to make them fall

2108
01:26:30,585 --> 01:26:33,021
while under my leadership.

2109
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:37,759
I'm responsible for those souls that I'm teaching.

2110
01:26:37,759 --> 01:26:39,527
Do you not understand

2111
01:26:40,828 --> 01:26:42,363
that their blood is on my hands

2112
01:26:42,363 --> 01:26:44,866
if I were to lead them astray?

2113
01:26:51,005 --> 01:26:53,508
(deep breath)

2114
01:26:54,776 --> 01:26:56,778
- Those people are grown

2115
01:26:58,813 --> 01:27:01,950
and they're gonna do what they wanna do,

2116
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:03,685
no matter what I say.

2117
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:07,689
And if they were really so

2118
01:27:07,689 --> 01:27:08,523
holy,

2119
01:27:09,991 --> 01:27:12,627
they would realize that I picked out the scriptures

2120
01:27:12,627 --> 01:27:16,898
that hyped them up to make them fork off for money.

2121
01:27:21,369 --> 01:27:23,037
- They may be grown.

2122
01:27:26,741 --> 01:27:29,143
But what about your daughter?

2123
01:27:44,993 --> 01:27:45,827
- Baby?

2124
01:27:47,395 --> 01:27:49,330
What are we doing here?

2125
01:27:54,035 --> 01:27:55,036
- Get out.

2126
01:27:55,036 --> 01:27:57,872

01:28:56,798 --> 01:28:58,633
I was just trying to find the right time to tell you.

2155
01:28:58,633 --> 01:29:02,570
I thought, I thought that maybe if I told you the right way,

2156
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:04,872
he would accept it.

01:29:04,872 --> 01:29:06,007
(Chop scoffs)

2158
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:07,842
- Believe this broad? (both chuckle)

2159
01:29:07,842 --> 01:29:10,611
- I, I'm telling the truth, baby.

2160
01:29:12,313 --> 01:29:13,147
Listen,

2161
01:29:14,549 --> 01:29:16,084
I just,

2162
01:29:16,084 --> 01:29:19,520
I know you weren't there for Trouble when he was born and

2163
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:20,922
maybe this is our chance.

2164
01:29:20,922 --> 01:29:22,657
Maybe now we can be a family.

2165
01:29:22,657 --> 01:29:25,827
Maybe God is giving you another chance.

2166
01:29:25,827 --> 01:29:29,497
- (laughing) You said, God?

2167
01:29:31,566 --> 01:29:33,034
You talking about the same God that

2168
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:34,569
you and that bitch ass nigga Keys is using

2169
01:29:34,569 --> 01:29:37,205
to pimp the saints whenever the door to the church is open?

2170
01:29:37,205 --> 01:29:38,139
(thunder roaring)

2171
01:29:38,139 --> 01:29:39,741
You talking about that God?

2172
01:29:39,741 --> 01:29:41,409
You talking about that God?

2173
01:29:41,409 --> 01:29:42,610
You funny as shit.

2174
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:44,612
She funny as shit, ain't she? (laughing)

2175
01:29:44,612 --> 01:29:47,582
You is a funny mother fucker.

2176
01:29:47,582 --> 01:29:50,451
(Chinirika laughing)

2177
01:29:50,451 --> 01:29:51,719
- You know the only thing funny

2178
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:54,422
is trying to reason with a man like you.

2179
01:29:54,422 --> 01:29:57,658
Shit, I should have been left your ass.

2180
01:29:57,658 --> 01:30:00,094
(tense music)

2181
01:30:00,094 --> 01:30:03,398
None of this shit is worth it.

2182
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:04,832
And Keys,

2183
01:30:04,832 --> 01:30:06,401
would've been a way better daddy to this baby

2184
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:08,736
than you could ever be.

2185
01:30:08,736 --> 01:30:11,339
Shit, he was a way better boss.

2186
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:14,275
That nigga stole your dope.

2187
01:30:14,275 --> 01:30:18,913
Started from nothing and still leveled up on your ass.

2188
01:30:18,913 --> 01:30:19,747
(scoffs)

2189
01:30:19,747 --> 01:30:21,249
I see why you mad.

2190
01:30:24,619 --> 01:30:25,820
(gun clicks)

2191
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:27,488
(repeated gunshots) (Shea shouting)

2192
01:30:27,488 --> 01:30:28,489
- Put that on God!

2193
01:30:28,489 --> 01:30:29,690
Put that on God!

2194
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:30,525
- Damn.

2195
01:30:31,859 --> 01:30:33,861
I ain't see that coming.

2196
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:36,197
(cocks gun)

2197
01:30:36,197 --> 01:30:38,666
Just like you didn't see this.

2198
01:30:38,666 --> 01:30:39,500
Yeah.

2199
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:40,301
Yeah.

2200
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:44,238
See you and Keys are alike in many ways.

2201
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:45,773
Y'all both about money.

2202
01:30:45,773 --> 01:30:49,177
Get rid of any nigga that get in y'all way.

2203
01:30:49,177 --> 01:30:52,580
But the difference between y'all two is;

2204
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:56,217
unlike him, you let your feelings guide you.

2205
01:30:57,652 --> 01:31:00,288
And you don't always know who on your team.

2206
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:01,522
Big ass mistake.

2207
01:31:03,257 --> 01:31:06,494
- Nigga, I always know who I got in my squad.

2208
01:31:06,494 --> 01:31:07,328
- Really?

2209
01:31:08,229 --> 01:31:09,130
So tell me,

2210
01:31:11,732 --> 01:31:13,167
you knew Kenya's brother was on your team?

2211
01:31:13,167 --> 01:31:15,203
(thunder roars)

2212
01:31:15,203 --> 01:31:16,137
- What the fuck you talking about?

2213
01:31:16,137 --> 01:31:18,339
(gunshot) (Chop screams)

2214
01:31:18,339 --> 01:31:19,607
Ah shit!

2215
01:31:19,607 --> 01:31:20,708
- Bitch ass nigga.

2216
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:22,910
- You bitch ass nigga! (gun clicks)

2217
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:24,312
- Probably shouldn't have used all your bullets

2218
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:27,114
on your little boo right here.

2219
01:31:27,114 --> 01:31:30,785
(chuckles) Imagine.

2220
01:31:30,785 --> 01:31:31,786
Just imagine

2221
01:31:33,754 --> 01:31:38,359
your mother gettin' the car the night before Christmas,

2222
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:44,432
and the police telling her her only daughter being shot.

2223
01:31:45,299 --> 01:31:46,567
Nigga, you know how it feel

2224
01:31:46,567 --> 01:31:48,336
to hear the woman that birthed you

2225
01:31:48,336 --> 01:31:51,973
struggle to breathe after hearing that shit?

2226
01:31:55,810 --> 01:31:58,212
But oh, what a God we serve, right?

2227
01:31:58,212 --> 01:31:59,847
What a God we serve.

2228
01:32:01,315 --> 01:32:04,118
'Cause right when we rushed in,

2229
01:32:04,118 --> 01:32:07,255
the doctors told us they was able to bring Kenya back.

2230
01:32:07,255 --> 01:32:09,590
(cocks gun)

2231
01:32:12,126 --> 01:32:13,361
- Kenya alive?

2232
01:32:13,361 --> 01:32:14,428
(gunshot) (Chop yelling)

2233
01:32:14,428 --> 01:32:16,564
- Did I fuckin' say talk?

2234
01:32:16,564 --> 01:32:18,799
- You bitch. - Did I say talk?

2235
01:32:18,799 --> 01:32:20,968
- Bitch ass nigga.

2236
01:32:20,968 --> 01:32:22,770
- I made my sister a promise

2237
01:32:22,770 --> 01:32:26,240
sitting next to her hospital bed.

2238
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:29,143
I told her my niece will be taken care of.

2239
01:32:29,143 --> 01:32:30,344
(chuckles)

2240
01:32:30,344 --> 01:32:32,680
Before I take my last breath

2241
01:32:35,316 --> 01:32:37,518
you and keys will already taken yours.

2242
01:32:37,518 --> 01:32:39,654
(Chop wincing)

2243
01:32:39,654 --> 01:32:41,455
- Nigga, you must have forgot

2244
01:32:41,455 --> 01:32:42,890
you talking about,

2245
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:43,724
ah shit.

2246
01:32:44,859 --> 01:32:45,660
Nigga,

2247
01:32:47,328 --> 01:32:48,529
you was saying all that shit about

2248
01:32:48,529 --> 01:32:50,498
who all on everybody team you early.

2249
01:32:50,498 --> 01:32:53,267
You must've forgot who had on my fuckin' team, nigga.

2250
01:32:53,267 --> 01:32:55,102
(Chop winces)

2251
01:32:55,102 --> 01:32:57,705
If I don't show up as planned later on

2252
01:32:57,705 --> 01:33:00,207
Trouble and all them niggas gonna be on your head.

2253
01:33:00,207 --> 01:33:02,977
'Cause they knew I was coming to meet your bitch ass.

2254
01:33:02,977 --> 01:33:05,112
(wincing) Oh shit.

2255
01:33:05,112 --> 01:33:06,080
- [Man On phone] Is it done yet?

2256
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:07,582
- Almost.

2257
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:09,050
Your boy here seems to think

2258
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:10,351
that y'all gonna be on my head

2259
01:33:10,351 --> 01:33:12,920
when he don't meet up with y'all later.

2260
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:13,921
You know, considering the fact

2261
01:33:13,921 --> 01:33:15,189
everybody knew he was me.

2262
01:33:15,189 --> 01:33:16,424
- [Man] I thought you was calling to tell me

2263
01:33:16,424 --> 01:33:18,426
his body was stinking by now. - What the?

2264
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:21,028
- [Man] After all the shit that he done caused us.

2265
01:33:21,028 --> 01:33:22,063
- [Chop] Fuck.

2266
01:33:22,063 --> 01:33:23,698
- Indeed. - Man, fuck that nigga.

2267
01:33:23,698 --> 01:33:25,199
- Indeed.

2268
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:28,235
I'll pull up when it's done.

2269
01:33:28,235 --> 01:33:32,573
- [Chop] (whispering) Fuck.

2270
01:33:32,573 --> 01:33:37,244
- My mama's favorite scripture for as long as I can remember

2271
01:33:37,244 --> 01:33:39,580
was Galatians six and seven.

2272
01:33:40,848 --> 01:33:42,450
Do not be deceived.

2273
01:33:43,584 --> 01:33:45,519
God will not be mocked.

2274
01:33:47,188 --> 01:33:49,290
A man reaps what he sows.

2275
01:33:51,225 --> 01:33:52,226
Good or bad.

2276
01:33:53,928 --> 01:33:55,396
You reap the benefits of what you plant.

2277
01:33:55,396 --> 01:33:57,598
- Nigga, shut that shit up!

2278
01:33:57,598 --> 01:34:00,001
Don't nobody wanna hear no god damn sermon.

2279
01:34:00,001 --> 01:34:03,237
Nigga wanna commit a sin and it all holier than thou.

2280
01:34:03,237 --> 01:34:05,606
Nigga, you might as well go ahead kill me now, nigga, so.

2281
01:34:05,606 --> 01:34:09,210
- As you please. (gunshot)

2282
01:34:14,215 --> 01:34:17,151
- [Guard] Reynolds, you got a visitor.

2283
01:34:17,151 --> 01:34:21,155
(inmates shouting indistinctly)

2284
01:34:42,977 --> 01:34:44,845
Open cell five.

2285
01:34:44,845 --> 01:34:47,348
(cell buzzes)

2286
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:04,699
- Baby girl.

2287
01:35:11,672 --> 01:35:12,506
You alive.

2288
01:35:13,674 --> 01:35:16,277
God knows I was worried about you.

2289
01:35:17,578 --> 01:35:20,381
- You was worried about me?

2290
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:23,150
Were you worried about me when you lied to me my whole life?

2291
01:35:23,150 --> 01:35:25,786
(intense music)

2292
01:35:25,786 --> 01:35:27,621
- Haven, listen to me.

2293
01:35:28,889 --> 01:35:31,959
I don't know what you heard about me,

2294
01:35:34,328 --> 01:35:35,162
but I did

2295
01:35:36,530 --> 01:35:39,800
what was best for you at the time?

2296
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:42,937
- (scoffs) No.

2297
01:35:42,937 --> 01:35:45,172
What was best for me?

2298
01:35:45,172 --> 01:35:46,874
What was best for me would've been

2299
01:35:46,874 --> 01:35:49,310
for you to tell me the truth.

2300
01:35:50,177 --> 01:35:51,712
What was best for me was be,

2301
01:35:51,712 --> 01:35:54,115
be for you to open your eyes!

2302
01:35:57,485 --> 01:36:01,322
For you to have not have lied and preached things

2303
01:36:01,322 --> 01:36:03,057
that you didn't even believe your damn self.

2304
01:36:03,057 --> 01:36:05,126
That's what would've been what's best for me.

2305
01:36:05,126 --> 01:36:06,260
But instead

2306
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:07,094
you knew

2307
01:36:10,131 --> 01:36:11,298
how hurt I was

2308
01:36:13,167 --> 01:36:14,802
that I didn't have a mother

2309
01:36:14,802 --> 01:36:15,636
and instead,

2310
01:36:15,636 --> 01:36:16,871
instead of you,

2311
01:36:17,705 --> 01:36:18,873
instead of you

2312
01:36:21,041 --> 01:36:24,612
spending as much time with me as you could.

2313
01:36:27,882 --> 01:36:30,317
What was best for me would you for you to live

2314
01:36:30,317 --> 01:36:32,086
a life of honesty,

2315
01:36:32,086 --> 01:36:35,322
but you lied to an entire congregation.

2316
01:36:38,759 --> 01:36:41,262
I already lost my mother to cancer,

2317
01:36:41,262 --> 01:36:45,833
but here you are sacrificing your life and mine

2318
01:36:45,833 --> 01:36:46,667
every day

2319
01:36:48,769 --> 01:36:51,038
and you have to audacity to try to tell me

2320
01:36:51,038 --> 01:36:52,640
what's best for me.

2321
01:36:54,341 --> 01:36:56,844
(deep exhale)

2322
01:37:00,748 --> 01:37:02,750
You're right, baby girl.

2323
01:37:05,252 --> 01:37:06,320
I was selfish

2324
01:37:09,857 --> 01:37:14,695
and consumed with being the biggest kingpin to ever do it.

2325
01:37:18,432 --> 01:37:19,600
But your mama,

2326
01:37:23,237 --> 01:37:26,140
she really was the love of my life.

2327
01:37:30,711 --> 01:37:33,013
And I put her in harm's way too.

2328
01:37:33,013 --> 01:37:33,848
- What?

2329
01:37:37,484 --> 01:37:40,287
What do you mean, you put her in harms way?

2330
01:37:40,287 --> 01:37:41,522
(slams table) Dad,

2331
01:37:41,522 --> 01:37:44,625
what do you mean you put her in harms way?

2332
01:37:49,363 --> 01:37:50,865
Stop lying to me.

2333
01:37:50,865 --> 01:37:52,533
What? What happened?

2334
01:37:55,336 --> 01:37:58,105
- She didn't die of cancer, baby.

2335
01:38:00,507 --> 01:38:03,510
(Haven crying) Baby.

2336
01:38:04,545 --> 01:38:06,146
Baby, what's wrong?

2337
01:38:07,414 --> 01:38:09,049
Haven?

2338
01:38:09,049 --> 01:38:10,284

01:38:10,284 --> 01:38:11,752
Yo, guard, guard, get my daughter!

Get my daughter. - What's wrong with her?

2341
01:38:12,786 --> 01:38:14,221
- She's breathing heavy, man.

2342
01:38:14,221 --> 01:38:15,055
We was just talking right there.

2343
01:38:15,055 --> 01:38:16,023
I don't even know

2344
01:38:16,023 --> 01:38:17,391
what happened! - Get back.

2345
01:38:17,391 --> 01:38:19,560
Medic, we need a medic in here.

2346
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:21,195
We need a medic in here.

2347
01:38:21,195 --> 01:38:22,830
Have a seat!

2348
01:38:22,830 --> 01:38:24,265
Sit down! (suspenseful music)

2349
01:38:24,265 --> 01:38:26,901
(Haven hyperventilating)

2350
01:38:26,901 --> 01:38:29,003
- What's her name? - Haven Reynolds.

2351
01:38:29,003 --> 01:38:31,171
- Haven, can you hear me? - [Hosea] Baby.

2352
01:38:31,171 --> 01:38:32,206
- She's hyperventilating. (Haven breathing heavy)

2353
01:38:32,206 --> 01:38:33,574
- Check her pulse.

2354
01:38:33,574 --> 01:38:35,542
- How far along are you? - [Hosea] Pregnant?

2355
01:38:35,542 --> 01:38:37,378
- Ma'am, how far along are you?

2356
01:38:37,378 --> 01:38:38,946
Yeah, she's pregnant, we have to take her to the E.R.

2357
01:38:38,946 --> 01:38:39,880
Let's go. - I guess you're not

2358
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:41,415

2359
01:38:41,415 --> 01:38:43,517
(heavily breathing) - [Medic] Come on, let's go.

2360
01:38:43,517 --> 01:38:44,451
Let's go, let's go.

2361
01:38:44,451 --> 01:38:47,354
(Haven breathing heavily)

2362
01:38:47,354 --> 01:38:50,925
(intense electronic music)

2363
01:38:58,332 --> 01:39:01,468
- (gasp) Ooh, Mi's here.

2364
01:39:01,468 --> 01:39:02,636

01:39:05,372 --> 01:39:06,874
- Uh-uh, granna.

2367
01:39:06,874 --> 01:39:08,108
Don't do my bestie like that.

2368
01:39:08,108 --> 01:39:09,176
- I got it, baby.

2369
01:39:09,176 --> 01:39:11,245
Just rest, okay.

2370
01:39:11,245 --> 01:39:13,013
Gonna go and get Mi.

2371
01:39:13,013 --> 01:39:13,847
- Mm.

2372
01:39:18,619 --> 01:39:19,920
- Hey, bro!

2373
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:21,488
- What's good, sis!

2374
01:39:21,488 --> 01:39:23,290
- How you doing? - I'm good, I'm good.

2375
01:39:23,290 --> 01:39:25,292

Touch! (both laughing)

2378
01:39:29,697 --> 01:39:31,031
Granna, darling!

2379
01:39:32,066 --> 01:39:33,567
- Hey little miss fastness.

2380
01:39:33,567 --> 01:39:35,035
- Oh. (Asa chuckling)

2381
01:39:35,035 --> 01:39:38,305
- Come on over and gimme my hug.

2382
01:39:38,305 --> 01:39:39,139

2383
01:39:39,139 --> 01:39:41,675
(Haven laughing)

2384
01:39:41,675 --> 01:39:44,545
(Haven and Mila screaming)

2385
01:39:44,545 --> 01:39:46,847
- Look at, Ti Ti baby.

2386
01:39:46,847 --> 01:39:48,615
- Stop that, you psycho.

2387
01:39:48,615 --> 01:39:49,850
You know, every time you do that,

2388
01:39:49,850 --> 01:39:51,452
it takes her hours to settle back down.

2389
01:39:51,452 --> 01:39:52,686
- Man.

2390
01:39:52,686 --> 01:39:54,121
- Well hurry up and spit her out then

2391
01:39:54,121 --> 01:39:56,357
so I can spoils her. (Haven laughing)

2392
01:39:56,357 --> 01:39:58,826
Oo, before I forget.

2393
01:39:58,826 --> 01:39:59,660
Ba-yow!

2394
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:00,494
- Wow. What?

2395
01:40:00,494 --> 01:40:01,829
- One for you

2396
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:02,730
and one for you, sir.

2397
01:40:02,730 --> 01:40:03,864
Yeah, mm-hmm.

2398
01:40:03,864 --> 01:40:04,698
- Uh huh.

2399
01:40:04,698 --> 01:40:05,532
- What's that?

2400
01:40:05,532 --> 01:40:06,367
- Ah!

2401
01:40:06,367 --> 01:40:07,601
Is this what I?

2402
01:40:07,601 --> 01:40:09,036
Ah!

2403
01:40:09,036 --> 01:40:10,104
Yes!

2404
01:40:10,104 --> 01:40:11,672
(Haven squealing)

2405
01:40:11,672 --> 01:40:12,773
- Well what is it?

2406
01:40:12,773 --> 01:40:14,174
- It's my degree!

2407
01:40:15,209 --> 01:40:16,477
With

2408
01:40:16,477 --> 01:40:18,012
honors!

2409
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:20,347
- Praise god! (Granna laughing)

2410
01:40:20,347 --> 01:40:23,384
- Yes, I'm so proud of you.

2411
01:40:23,384 --> 01:40:26,920
- Oh, my goodness, I actually did it.

2412
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:29,023
I am so sorry that I couldn't walk with you

2413
01:40:29,023 --> 01:40:32,192
like we always planned, Mi. - Oh, I know.

2414
01:40:32,192 --> 01:40:33,794
That's why I didn't walk.

2415
01:40:33,794 --> 01:40:35,095
- What?

2416
01:40:35,095 --> 01:40:36,630
- Calm down.

2417
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:38,298
You know, I wasn't about to walk that stage

2418
01:40:38,298 --> 01:40:39,433
without my sister.

2419
01:40:39,433 --> 01:40:40,667
- Oh.

2420
01:40:40,667 --> 01:40:42,236
- So this just means when we get our masters,

2421
01:40:42,236 --> 01:40:44,671
you better not be full of another baby 'cause we

2422
01:40:44,671 --> 01:40:46,774
gone twerk across the stage. (Haven exclaiming)

2423
01:40:46,774 --> 01:40:47,608
Ah, ah! - Aye, ah, ah!

2424
01:40:47,608 --> 01:40:48,709
(both celebrating)

2425
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:50,511
- Aye, oh, baby mama!

2426
01:40:50,511 --> 01:40:51,712
Ah, ah.

2427
01:40:51,712 --> 01:40:52,679
Ah!

2428
01:40:52,679 --> 01:40:54,681
- Hey, what's wrong, babe?

2429
01:40:56,517 --> 01:40:57,851
Hmm?

2430
01:40:57,851 --> 01:40:58,952
- You open.

2431
01:40:58,952 --> 01:40:59,987
- What is is?

2432
01:41:03,357 --> 01:41:05,092
Baby you went and got your GED?

2433
01:41:05,092 --> 01:41:06,493
- Yeah.

2434
01:41:06,493 --> 01:41:09,096
- What, why didn't you tell me?

2435
01:41:10,798 --> 01:41:14,168
- I ain't wanna disappoint you just in case I failed.

2436
01:41:14,168 --> 01:41:16,503
- Maybe you can never disappoint me.

2437
01:41:16,503 --> 01:41:18,806
The fact that you stepped out on faith and took the test,

2438
01:41:18,806 --> 01:41:20,541
I am so proud of you.

2439
01:41:22,142 --> 01:41:23,544
(Asa sighs)

2440
01:41:23,544 --> 01:41:24,378
- All right now,

2441
01:41:24,378 --> 01:41:25,813
what does it say?

2442
01:41:25,813 --> 01:41:30,484
- Oh, okay. (Asa deep takes deep breath)

2443
01:41:50,637 --> 01:41:51,438
Okay.

2444
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:55,542
- If you don't spit out that tea.

2445
01:41:55,542 --> 01:41:56,343
- Um.

2446
01:42:00,214 --> 01:42:00,948
Uh.

2447
01:42:03,083 --> 01:42:06,420
It says, (mellow guitar music)

2448
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:07,254
it says,

2449
01:42:09,756 --> 01:42:12,593
that my baby passed all four sections

2450
01:42:12,593 --> 01:42:13,861
with honors! - (clapping) Hallelujah.

2451
01:42:13,861 --> 01:42:14,828
Praise god! - I passed?

2452
01:42:14,828 --> 01:42:17,464
Yes, look, babe! - [Mila] Yes!

2453
01:42:17,464 --> 01:42:20,467
- Ah! (both laughing)

2454
01:42:20,467 --> 01:42:21,301
- Oh, my God.

2455
01:42:21,301 --> 01:42:23,137
- Yes. - [Granna] Amen.

2456
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:24,404
- I'm so proud of you.

2457
01:42:24,404 --> 01:42:27,074
- Thank you for not making me feel dumb.

2458
01:42:27,074 --> 01:42:28,509
Talking down on me.

2459
01:42:28,509 --> 01:42:29,943
Granna you too.

2460
01:42:29,943 --> 01:42:31,745
That really helped me.

2461
01:42:31,745 --> 01:42:33,580
- I will always believe in you

2462
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:34,781
because I know for a fact that

2463
01:42:34,781 --> 01:42:37,217
God has higher plans for you.

2464
01:42:38,385 --> 01:42:39,953
Congratulations.

2465
01:42:39,953 --> 01:42:41,221
- Thank you. - Mm.

2466
01:42:41,221 --> 01:42:43,824
- Look, I know, God got something better for me.

2467
01:42:43,824 --> 01:42:45,058
- Oh?

2468
01:42:45,058 --> 01:42:46,326
- 'Cause instead of going to just,

2469
01:42:46,326 --> 01:42:48,562
you know, regular college. - Mm-hmm?

2470
01:42:48,562 --> 01:42:50,063
- I'ma go to seminary school.

2471
01:42:50,063 --> 01:42:51,498
- Oh, hallelujah!

2472
01:42:51,498 --> 01:42:52,699
Won't he do it?

2473
01:42:52,699 --> 01:42:54,835
- No he didn't! - Go head, grand baby!

2474
01:42:54,835 --> 01:42:57,704
Yes, Jesus. - [Haven] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2475
01:42:57,704 --> 01:42:58,739
Ah!

2476
01:42:58,739 --> 01:43:00,874
Okay, so what's going on?

2477
01:43:00,874 --> 01:43:03,310
Oh, what's going on?

2478
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:05,679
- I think I met someone.

2479
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:08,415
- Child, you think or you know?

2480
01:43:08,415 --> 01:43:09,650
- You know what I mean?

2481
01:43:09,650 --> 01:43:11,585
- No, I don't know what you mean

2482
01:43:11,585 --> 01:43:15,055
because you definitely pick the crunchiest men

2483
01:43:15,055 --> 01:43:16,190
I've ever found, - Uh.

2484
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:17,124
- in your entire life.

2485
01:43:17,124 --> 01:43:18,525
So tell me

2486
01:43:18,525 --> 01:43:20,093
which creature from the Bikini Bottom

2487
01:43:20,093 --> 01:43:22,262
have you chosen this time? (laughing)

2488
01:43:22,262 --> 01:43:24,765
- If you weren't pregnant I would push you off this bed.

2489
01:43:24,765 --> 01:43:25,766
They are not that bad.

2490
01:43:25,766 --> 01:43:26,867
- They are horrible.

2491
01:43:26,867 --> 01:43:28,268
Like horrid.

2492
01:43:28,268 --> 01:43:29,336
- Mm-hmm.

2493
01:43:29,336 --> 01:43:30,938
- So. - Yeah, you right.

2494
01:43:30,938 --> 01:43:31,972
- Okay. - Justin did look like

2495
01:43:31,972 --> 01:43:33,774
he was related to Squidward.

2496
01:43:33,774 --> 01:43:36,710
- The way that he sounded! - (nasally) Squidward.

2497
01:43:36,710 --> 01:43:39,012
- (nasally) He was like, Mila, I love you.

2498
01:43:39,012 --> 01:43:40,747
(both laughing)

2499
01:43:40,747 --> 01:43:42,816
- Oh, I was so bad. - Oh!

2500
01:43:42,816 --> 01:43:44,418
Oh.

2501
01:43:44,418 --> 01:43:45,252
Ow.

2502
01:43:45,252 --> 01:43:46,186
- You okay?

2503
01:43:47,421 --> 01:43:48,989
- I think my water just broke.

2504
01:43:48,989 --> 01:43:49,923
- What?

2505
01:43:49,923 --> 01:43:50,991
Oh my.

2506
01:43:50,991 --> 01:43:51,825
- No, no.

2507
01:43:51,825 --> 01:43:52,659
Ow.

2508
01:43:52,659 --> 01:43:53,894
- Grandma! Asa!

2509
01:43:55,629 --> 01:43:58,031
Breathe, are you okay? - (heavily breathing) Yeah.

2510
01:43:58,031 --> 01:43:59,666
- [Both] What's wrong?!

2511
01:43:59,666 --> 01:44:00,701
- I think her water just broke.

2512
01:44:00,701 --> 01:44:01,702
We gotta go.

2513
01:44:03,403 --> 01:44:04,238
- [Asa] Uh.

2514
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:05,405
- We gotta go.

2515
01:44:05,405 --> 01:44:06,707
- Boy, if you don't get your shoes

2516
01:44:06,707 --> 01:44:08,041

2517
01:44:08,041 --> 01:44:10,210
- Okay, I'll get it, all right.

01:44:10,210 --> 01:44:12,713

2519
01:44:12,713 --> 01:44:14,381

2521
01:44:17,851 --> 01:44:20,854

2522
01:44:20,854 --> 01:44:23,357
Oo, ooh, oo, okay, okay, okay.

2523
01:44:25,125 --> 01:44:27,261
(gentle music)

2524
01:44:27,261 --> 01:44:30,264
(monitor beeping)

2525
01:44:30,264 --> 01:44:31,765
- [Doctor] You did great, Haven.

2526
01:44:31,765 --> 01:44:33,033
- Thank you.

2527
01:44:33,033 --> 01:44:34,301
- You too, dad.

2528
01:44:34,301 --> 01:44:37,704
- Thank you. - My babies done had a baby.

2529
01:44:38,939 --> 01:44:40,374
(soft chuckles)

2530
01:44:40,374 --> 01:44:41,308
- Oh my gosh.

2531
01:44:41,308 --> 01:44:42,976
I can't believe, I'm a mom.

2532
01:44:42,976 --> 01:44:45,245
- Oh, well believe it, honey.

2533
01:44:45,245 --> 01:44:47,948
And it's about to get real, real.

2534
01:44:47,948 --> 01:44:51,418
Wait 'til that child start waking up every two hours to eat.

2535
01:44:51,418 --> 01:44:52,653
- [Haven] Oh.

2536
01:44:52,653 --> 01:44:53,954
- And don't come looking for granna

2537
01:44:53,954 --> 01:44:57,624
'cause I'm going to be down Mr. Rufus' house.

2538
01:44:57,624 --> 01:44:58,725
(laughing)

2539
01:44:58,725 --> 01:44:59,559
Oh,

2540
01:44:59,559 --> 01:45:00,527
what? - [Asa] Granna.

2541
01:45:00,527 --> 01:45:02,462
- This old lady ain't dead yet.

2542
01:45:02,462 --> 01:45:05,766
Besides Mr. Rufus as fine as he wanna be.

2543
01:45:05,766 --> 01:45:07,234
Look like a young Billy Dee.

2544
01:45:07,234 --> 01:45:10,671
- I know that's right. (both laughing)

2545
01:45:10,671 --> 01:45:12,172
- You know, I'ma have to,

2546
01:45:12,172 --> 01:45:14,174
I'ma have to go down and see about this, Mr. Rufus.

2547
01:45:14,174 --> 01:45:15,375
And see what he talking about.

2548
01:45:15,375 --> 01:45:16,943
'Cause granna you can't.

2549
01:45:16,943 --> 01:45:19,579
- You don't be out here hating on granna.

2550
01:45:19,579 --> 01:45:21,515
- Mm-hmm. (Haven laughing)

2551
01:45:21,515 --> 01:45:23,183
- I ain't hatin'. (granna laughing)

2552
01:45:23,183 --> 01:45:24,618
- Mm, you wanna hold her?

2553
01:45:24,618 --> 01:45:25,719
- Yeah - Yeah.

2554
01:45:25,719 --> 01:45:27,754
- Yeah. - All right, now.

2555
01:45:27,754 --> 01:45:31,091
- Come on, you got her. - Easy, grandson.

2556
01:45:31,091 --> 01:45:32,926
- Hold on. Hold on.

2557
01:45:32,926 --> 01:45:34,227
- Hold her head.

2558
01:45:34,227 --> 01:45:35,562
- Okay, okay.

2559
01:45:35,562 --> 01:45:37,831
(monitor beeping)

2560
01:45:37,831 --> 01:45:40,500
- Just like that. - [Haven] Daddy.

2561
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:43,236
(Mila chuckling)

2562
01:45:45,372 --> 01:45:48,508
- What's wrong with you, baby girl?

2563
01:45:48,508 --> 01:45:52,079
- (sighs) Nothing, it's.

2564
01:45:52,079 --> 01:45:52,913
I'm so,

2565
01:45:54,448 --> 01:45:56,283
I'm so appreciative

2566
01:45:56,283 --> 01:45:58,051
of you guys all thank you with me,

2567
01:45:58,051 --> 01:45:58,885
it's just,

2568
01:46:01,722 --> 01:46:03,623
I'm just realizing that

2569
01:46:05,058 --> 01:46:08,628
neither of my parents are here to experience this with me.

2570
01:46:08,628 --> 01:46:10,997
- Look, I understand baby,

2571
01:46:10,997 --> 01:46:12,966
but I, I'm just grateful

2572
01:46:12,966 --> 01:46:14,668
you got an opportunity

2573
01:46:14,668 --> 01:46:17,504
to talk to your daddy and forgive him.

2574
01:46:17,504 --> 01:46:19,873
Forgiveness is everything, baby.

2575
01:46:19,873 --> 01:46:21,641
- [Haven] Yes.

2576
01:46:21,641 --> 01:46:23,143
Yeah.

2577
01:46:23,143 --> 01:46:24,277
- Now,

2578
01:46:24,277 --> 01:46:25,612
have you all decided

2579
01:46:25,612 --> 01:46:27,280
what you gonna name this child?

2580
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:28,548
I mean,

2581
01:46:28,548 --> 01:46:30,183
we can continue to call her gorgeous

2582
01:46:30,183 --> 01:46:33,086
because that's exactly what she is.

2583
01:46:33,086 --> 01:46:36,656
- (laughing) Yeah, we did.

2584
01:46:38,992 --> 01:46:41,428
That's unfortunate that Haven's parents aren't here

2585
01:46:41,428 --> 01:46:44,564
to experience this with us but

2586
01:46:44,564 --> 01:46:47,367
we still wanted to honor them so

2587
01:46:47,367 --> 01:46:49,503
we decided to name her

2588
01:46:49,503 --> 01:46:51,238
Kenya Hosanna Thomas.

2589
01:46:52,172 --> 01:46:53,774
- Amen.

2590
01:46:53,774 --> 01:46:55,942
- Did someone say my name?

2591
01:46:57,677 --> 01:46:59,880
(granna gasps)

2592
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:01,014
- Mom?

2593
01:47:01,014 --> 01:47:02,749
- Oh, that's the God I serve.

2594
01:47:02,749 --> 01:47:04,284
- Mom? - Yes, baby, yes.

2595
01:47:04,284 --> 01:47:06,787
(both crying)

2596
01:47:08,755 --> 01:47:12,559
(indistinctly speaking through tears)

2597
01:47:12,559 --> 01:47:13,727
- Oh, my good.

2598
01:47:14,961 --> 01:47:16,630
Oh, let me see my baby.

2599
01:47:16,630 --> 01:47:19,633
- Oh, you gotta meet her. - Oh, my god.

2600
01:47:19,633 --> 01:47:21,134
- Oh, look at.

2601
01:47:21,134 --> 01:47:24,104
(Asa chuckling)

2602
01:47:24,104 --> 01:47:25,772
- Oh, you're a grandma.

2603
01:47:25,772 --> 01:47:28,008
- You sweet beautiful baby.

2604
01:47:29,743 --> 01:47:31,711
(whispering indistinctly)

2605
01:47:31,711 --> 01:47:33,914
- [Kenya] Granny's here now.

2606
01:47:33,914 --> 01:47:36,149
(laughing)

2607
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:41,888
- We did it. - We did it.

2608
01:47:41,888 --> 01:47:43,056
- Oh, look at.

2609
01:47:44,558 --> 01:47:46,393
- I'm so proud of you.

2610
01:47:53,099 --> 01:47:54,601
- Hey. - Asa!

2611
01:47:54,601 --> 01:47:55,936
If you had to taken any longer to open that door,

2612
01:47:55,936 --> 01:47:57,804
you was gonna have to change my diaper.

2613
01:47:57,804 --> 01:47:58,638
(Kenya laughing) - I'm sorry.

2614
01:47:58,638 --> 01:47:59,739
I'm sorry.

2615
01:47:59,739 --> 01:48:00,974
- How you doing baby? - I'm good.

2616
01:48:00,974 --> 01:48:01,842
- You ain't keeping up no trouble, are you?

2617
01:48:01,842 --> 01:48:02,642
- No. - Okay, good.

2618
01:48:02,642 --> 01:48:03,877
Now, get out my way.

2619
01:48:03,877 --> 01:48:04,878
I'm here to see my granddaughter.

2620
01:48:04,878 --> 01:48:07,247
- Yeah. - Where is Gigi's baby?

2621
01:48:07,247 --> 01:48:08,515
- She's right here.

2622
01:48:08,515 --> 01:48:11,284
- [Kenya] Gigi's baby, come here to grandma.

2623
01:48:11,284 --> 01:48:13,687
- Here she is. - Bring her to me.

2624
01:48:13,687 --> 01:48:15,255
Let me see here.

2625
01:48:15,255 --> 01:48:16,323
- Hi there,

2626
01:48:16,323 --> 01:48:18,758
little Kenya benya. - Hey.

2627
01:48:18,758 --> 01:48:22,028
- Hi, stinker. (Haven sighs)

2628
01:48:22,028 --> 01:48:22,863
- Hey, Meech.

2629
01:48:22,863 --> 01:48:23,997
Let me holler at you

2630
01:48:23,997 --> 01:48:24,998
for a minute. - [Kenya] How are you

2631
01:48:24,998 --> 01:48:26,199
doing baby? - All right.

2632
01:48:26,199 --> 01:48:27,434
- [Kenya] Oh my goodness.

2633
01:48:27,434 --> 01:48:29,936
Did you know that your name was...

2634
01:48:37,210 --> 01:48:38,745
(Asa sighs)

2635
01:48:38,745 --> 01:48:39,913
- Man, they say

2636
01:48:39,913 --> 01:48:41,748
whoever killed O'Shea,

2637
01:48:43,083 --> 01:48:45,752
put two bullets in his body.

2638
01:48:45,752 --> 01:48:47,020
- It was three.

2639
01:48:48,889 --> 01:48:49,890
- Man, look.

2640
01:48:51,324 --> 01:48:54,928
I know you was O'Shea's right hand man for years,

2641
01:48:54,928 --> 01:48:57,964
but I need you to understand,

2642
01:48:57,964 --> 01:49:00,901
I need to make sure I can trust you.

2643
01:49:03,036 --> 01:49:04,771
- Look, man.

2644
01:49:04,771 --> 01:49:07,440
My business was with O'Shea.

2645
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:11,211
Long as you take care of Haven and that baby,

2646
01:49:11,211 --> 01:49:12,045
we good.

2647
01:49:13,246 --> 01:49:15,682
- (chuckling) All right.

2648
01:49:15,682 --> 01:49:18,952
(hip hop music begins)

2649
01:49:23,723 --> 01:49:24,824
- Damn, fool.

2650
01:49:26,826 --> 01:49:28,428
How is he?

2651
01:49:28,428 --> 01:49:30,764
- Well, he's finally resting.

2652
01:49:30,764 --> 01:49:31,831
I'm surprised he's still alive

2653
01:49:31,831 --> 01:49:33,767
after all the blood he's lost.

2654
01:49:33,767 --> 01:49:36,202
You sure you don't wanna take him to the hospital?

2655
01:49:36,202 --> 01:49:38,471
- Look, no hospitals, no visitors.

2656
01:49:38,471 --> 01:49:40,473
Nobody can know he's here.

2657
01:49:40,473 --> 01:49:41,741
Just do what the fuck I pay you for

2658
01:49:41,741 --> 01:49:44,044
and keep the nigga alive, all right?

2659
01:49:44,044 --> 01:49:46,146
