1
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,500
What kind of bird is that?

2
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:03,218
Why don't you sit up with the others and meditate,
and you can imagine all the birds you want.

3
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:05,887
I don't want to close my eyes today.

4
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,270
Want to help me ring the bell?

5
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,610
Okay, here you go, hand these out.

6
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,702
Good job.

7
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,738
Give them some pongal.

8
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,043
What did you get?

9
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,383
Nice to see you too.

10
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,020
What is this?

11
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:59,106
Where's the food, the
beds, school supplies?

12
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,974
That's all I could get for the money.

13
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,703
So where's the money?

14
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:23,793
They want you to meet with
them in New York. “What?

15
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,212
To tell them why we are a worthy cause.

16
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,177
- How many hoops do we have to jump through?
- It's their money.

17
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,722
I won't teach them about compassion
when the kids need me here,

18
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:36,218
- so tell them to save the goddamn whales.
- They want to give us $2 million.

19
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,798
Look at his pants.

20
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:09,713
He's a baby.

21
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,675
He peed his bed.

22
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,390
Gget out of here!

23
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,768
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Stop it! I hate you!

24
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,183
Stop!

25
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,682
Jal, jai, jal, it's okay. It's okay.

26
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,109
Can you get me some sheets?

27
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,603
It's okay. It's okay.

28
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,480
You're okay. You're okay.

29
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,609
I'm here. I'm right here.
Look at me. Look at me.

30
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,656
Look at me. I'm right here, okay?

31
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:36,949
I'm not leaving him.

32
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,040
Do you hear me?

33
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,044
I do.

34
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,509
Why don't I go to new
York and meet with them?

35
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,630
You could fill me in, and I
could take them through it.

36
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,430
It's on my way to Argentina.

37
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:01,772
Sort of.

38
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,309
Yes.

39
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,480
I understand.

40
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,318
Of course.

41
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,448
It has to be you.

42
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:26,958
Bye-bye.

43
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,001
Bye-bye. Ta-ta.

44
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,545
Bye-bye.

45
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:31,917
Bye-bye.

46
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,171
Bye-bye.

47
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,218
Check on him every night.

48
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:41,935
We were here long before god
brought you to us, Isabel.

49
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,179
I'm not coming back without
a suitcase full of money.

50
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,538
Bye.

51
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,535
Hey, guys. What's up?

52
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,662
Tanya, you don't have to sell them on it.

53
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:50,412
Just walk them through it. Give them all
the information they need. What else?

54
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,133
Yeah, well, then we're gonna
need bill on the call.

55
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,717
Can somebody shoot him an e-mail?

56
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,219
You know what?

57
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:05,140
If you can't get him tonight, then let's do this
tomorrow because I don't want to go through it twice.

58
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:09,059
Okay? Gwen, can you stay on the line?

59
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:13,060
Will you get bill first thing
tomorrow and then get me”? Okay.

60
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:16,907
Okay.

61
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,492
Well, is Cahill at home or at the office?

62
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:23,828
Will you text me her cell, please?

63
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:27,120
Okay. I'm finished for the night. Bye-bye.

64
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,961
Chickens! Little chickens!

65
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,330
Hi, dusty. Hi.

66
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,297
- Oh, what are you doing?
- Hi, mom.

67
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:38,509
You know I don't like that game.

68
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,504
- But dad said we could.
- Dad said we could.

69
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:43,382
He did? Well, mommy's home now, okay?

70
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,054
Just five more minutes.

71
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,473
- Yeah.
- I don't think so.

72
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,611
And 40007?

73
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,573
Cycle through them.

74
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:15,955
Hi, bunny.

75
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,503
Hi, daddy.

76
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:21,886
Nothing.

77
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,632
Just getting married this weekend.

78
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,553
Yeah, I heard.

79
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,643
- Not that big a deal.
- Grace!

80
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,602
Milly bought us a round of shots.

81
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,979
Sounds like you're having fun over there.

82
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,269
Kind of.

83
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,399
Hey, grace?

84
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,407
Yeah?

85
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,567
It's gonna be perfect, okay?

86
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:46,866
Your mom's got everyone working
at maximum efficiency.

87
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,823
Thank you, daddy.

88
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,540
How's the show coming?

89
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,251
You know, work in progress.
Thanks for asking.

90
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,171
I just... I wanted to call and say hi.

91
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,507
I love you, Gracie.

92
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,304
I love you too.

93
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,796
Okay. Bye.

94
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,392
Congratulations!

95
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,725
- We love you, grace!
- I love you.

96
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:27,027
"The expression on his face changed rapidly
from fear to sadness to anger.

97
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,528
'Who are you, boy?

98
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,030
Did you draw these pictures?'

99
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,623
Hugo didn't answer him.

100
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,585
'I said, did you draw these pictures?

101
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,751
Hugo growled again and spit on the floor.

102
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,749
'Who did you steal this notebook from?"

103
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,250
' Didn't steal it!"

104
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,776
What is wrong with the boys?
Why are they reading?

105
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,739
Hey, did you tell them that they can play
that killing-each-other-in-outer-space game?

106
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,983
Lords of domination? Maybe.

107
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,112
- So how does it look?
- I don't know.

108
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,456
It's never quite like I imagine.

109
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:18,169
No, it's gonna be great. The work is beautiful.
You should just relax and try to enjoy it.

110
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:21,335
And Gracie called. I think she was looking
for some reassurance.

111
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,378
She sounded nervous.

112
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,923
Guess it runs in the family.

113
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,886
- Are you feeling nervous?
- Are you nervous?

114
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,426
- Are you nervous?
- Are you nervous?

115
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,675
- One second. I'm getting a call.
- Are you nervous?

116
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,426
- How's it going? She can't talk now.
- No.

117
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,599
- She's feeling nervous.
- Stop tickling me.

118
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,972
- Don't. No! No, no, no!
- Does this make you nervous?

119
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,975
- Who's nervous now?
- Do not... oh, my god!

120
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,022
No, no, no.

121
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,409
How'd they respond to the retention period?

122
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,904
That's not gonna work for me.

123
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:57,158
We can give on the deferred compensation, but
the retention period is nonnegotiable, okay?

124
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:04,249
All right. Look, I'm walking the dog, so
I'll call you back when I get in the car.

125
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,260
Thanks.

126
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:57,310
Dusty, what are you doing? No, no, no.
Don't eat that.

127
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,792
Miss andersen, welcome to New York.

128
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:25,084
We're so happy you'll be staying with us
at the hotel. Right this way.

129
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,126
This is our 14th-floor penthouse suite.

130
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:34,097
It's 1000 square feet with
a 650 square-foot terrace.

131
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:40,096
There's a carrara marble bathroom with a
deep soaking tub and a rainfall shower.

132
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,516
This is your cell phone.

133
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,519
There's a car at your disposal.

134
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:47,769
My number and the driver's
are both programmed.

135
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,568
Anything that I can do to make your stay more
comfortable, please don't hesitate to ask.

136
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,884
Isabel? Yes?

137
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:20,093
I'm Jonathan. I'm here to
take you to your meeting.

138
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,511
Oh, okay.

139
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,060
How's the hotel? You comfortable?
Yes.

140
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,183
Good. I chose it myself.

141
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,691
Have you ever met Theresa?

142
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,779
No.

143
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,115
She's very impressive.

144
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,952
She built horizon from
nothing 22 years ago,

145
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:42,119
and now it's the biggest media placement
company in the United States.

146
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,162
It sounds like you know her well.

147
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,126
I've worked at the company for four years.

148
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,462
And she's my mother-in-law.

149
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:51,253
Or will be, on Saturday.

150
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,591
Marrying her daughter.

151
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,636
Congratulations.

152
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,057
Thanks.

153
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,979
How long will you be away?

154
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,770
Just a week.

155
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:19,031
- Will you be back for my birthday?
- I don't miss birthdays, jai.

156
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,403
There's free ice cream.

157
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,122
Thank you so much.

158
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,264
I'm so sorry. They're almost finished.

159
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:47,514
- But I keep telling them...
- Christine?

160
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:51,484
Christine, the valuation potentially
changes if it leaks into next quarter.

161
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,897
Can I get you a water?

162
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,318
- Means conceding a few points, and that's fine with me.
- No, thank you.

163
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,236
Okay, but I think the original number is...

164
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,986
I'm sorry. Can you excuse me one moment?

165
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:03,329
Tanya and I will call you
back with suggestions.

166
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,789
Yes, that's great. And I've got to go.

167
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,704
I'll talk to you later.

168
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:11,955
I don't know why we hired someone to guide us
through this process who we now need to guide.

169
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,753
She's been through this with other
companies, so that's valuable.

170
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,173
Can we think about renegotiating her fee?
We're doing most of the work here.

171
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,847
- Okay? Hi.
- Okay. Okay.

172
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:24,638
I am so sorry to keep you waiting.
You must be Isabel.

173
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,101
- Yes.
- I'm Theresa.

174
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,892
- Theresa, it's so nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

175
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,479
It's so clear today that
you can see New Jersey.

176
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,727
I don't know why you'd want to though.

177
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,563
Let's go to my office.

178
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,986
Please, come in, sit down.
You must be exhausted.

179
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,033
I'm fine, really.
“What's the time difference?

180
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:48,078
- Nine hours. Thank you.
- Here, have a seat.

181
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:54,334
So I watched the video my group
brought back from India.

182
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:57,709
What's really going on there
just can't be understood through a video.

183
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,211
I think it gave a pretty good sense.

184
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,929
There are over 200,000 child
prostitutes in the south alone.

185
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,800
Five times that number
suffer from malnutrition.

186
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,393
Those numbers increase when you
get into the bigger cities.

187
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,309
Hundreds of thousands die
from minor illnesses and infections,

188
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:15,560
completely preventable and for very little
money, if someone had the inclination.

189
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,695
- Because it's preventable.
- I'm so sorry to interrupt.

190
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:26,241
I have the caterers on the line. They want to know
if they can use mussels and shrimp in the Risotto.

191
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,988
There's a lobster shortage.

192
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,118
Is there a lobster shortage,
or can they not get enough lobster?

193
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,586
I'm not sure.

194
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,126
Will you find out?

195
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,876
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry about that.
You just caught me at a very busy time.

196
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,798
My daughter's getting married this weekend.

197
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,922
- I met your son-in-law.
- Yeah, Jonathan.

198
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:48,552
Well, grace says she's in love
and she's ready to get married, and...

199
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:53,272
I could fight her, and tell her she's too young
and that she doesn't know what she's doing.

200
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,062
And have her hate me forever, or...

201
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,186
I could give her a beautiful wedding.

202
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,232
Do you have kids?

203
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,654
No. Partner?

204
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,823
No, my work is all-consuming.

205
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:11,331
Yeah, I get it, it's a lot. It's
really a lot to manage both.

206
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:14,577
I just always wanted both,
so I worked hard at it.

207
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:18,706
I have twin boys too. I worked
hard to get them, believe me.

208
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:25,588
So we do have a list of priorities,
if you're interested in seeing that.

209
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,009
Okay.

210
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:30,555
What we'd like to do is take in
three times the number of kids.

211
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,680
- Okay.
- Change our food program,

212
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:37,149
subsidize, buy from local
farmers, vaccinate...

213
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,565
Which can be done for under $5 per child.

214
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:42,741
This is...

215
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:44,778
It's great.

216
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,650
It's very, very impressive...

217
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,948
- Thank you.
- The work you're doing.

218
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:52,494
I feel I need a little
more time to explore this.

219
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:56,369
There are a lot of very deserving
organizations out there.

220
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,460
What?

221
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:01,841
I'm sorry, I was under the impression that
you had already decided to be involved.

222
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:05,177
If you look at the information there,
you can see that the need is undeniable.

223
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:08,423
Clearly. I just have a
big weekend ahead of me.

224
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:12,552
So leave all this with me, we'll have lunch
on Monday and I'll tell you what I can do.

225
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:15,726
In the meantime, come to the wedding.
We can get to know each other better.

226
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,816
- I have a flight to India.
- Staying the weekend won't kill you.

227
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:22,528
Gwen? Gwen? Can you get Isabel
an invitation to the wedding?

228
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,566
Right away.

229
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:27,943
And you won't be uncomfortable, I promise
you. It's just a big party. It'll be fun.

230
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,535
Dr. Cahill is here for
the insurance workup.

231
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,995
- Send her in.
- I need a physical?

232
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,660
No, it's not for you. It's for me.

233
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,955
Got a lot of hoops to jump through
to sell your company. Thank you so much.

234
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,374
Thank you. What a pleasure to meet you.

235
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,997
- Thank you so much for your time.
- I'll see you tomorrow. Okay?

236
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,793
- The style is just classic. Allow me to show you.
- Right.

237
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,964
I understand your reticence.
Let's go. Time is money.

238
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:27,802
Chop-chop. Come on. Come on.
I see one swan here. I need to see three.

239
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,761
I et's do this. Come on.

240
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:33,178
- Let's go. You, sir, side door, please.
- Yeah, they got the lobster.

241
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,517
- Easy, easy.
- What? What'd you do?

242
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:38,103
I nixed the ice sculpture,
and Melinda's having a fit.

243
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,768
Sir, could we hurry it up? Thank you.

244
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,733
It's probably not the time to tell her
that we need another chair.

245
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,773
- Come on. Time is money. Let's go!
- I invited somebody from work.

246
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,689
Maybe...

247
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:53,491
I just won't tell her and put
it in after, when she leaves.

248
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,078
- Where's grace?
- Is she gonna leave?

249
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,663
- She's in the back.
- Okay.

250
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:57,998
You got this? Okay.

251
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:09,419
Yeah. Okay, thank you.

252
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,843
Hi. So if you could just
wrap them around the tree?

253
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:17,344
And then, also, more just
hanging down a foot.

254
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,891
But, yeah, I'll be right back, okay?

255
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,390
- The chairs are too slanted.
- I told you.

256
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,017
How you doing?

257
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,394
Doing okay? Yeah.

258
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:28,562
Any doubts?

259
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,485
- You wish.
- No.

260
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,028
I wish what you wish.

261
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,196
Thank you.

262
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,367
I don't know why you can't live
together for a while though.

263
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,207
- Really?
- And he's not as good-looking as you.

264
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,543
You went there. That's nice.

265
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:45,913
Is there anything else?

266
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,341
You'll always be mine, remember that.

267
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,262
God, you're honestly the worst.

268
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:55,923
You're the worst.

269
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:03,231
Can you just, like, try before the wedding
to get all of your crying out?

270
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,350
- Yeah, I will.
- It sets me off.

271
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,190
You set me off.

272
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:11,989
Okay.

273
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:15,576
- I have to go. I'm so busy. I have so many things to do.
- Me too.

274
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,321
- I have chairs to un-slant and stuff like that.
- Oh, my god.

275
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,040
What? That's awesome!

276
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,573
Yeah, it's big.

277
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,701
It's big, but it's also small.

278
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,922
All the buildings are squeezed together
in these really small, little spaces.

279
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,586
Are there birds?

280
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:57,007
Yeah, there's birds. But they're
different from what we're used fo.

281
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:00,214
When will you be back?

282
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,385
As soon as I can.

283
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,223
I want you to set a good example
for the others while I'm gone.

284
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,103
Okay.

285
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,473
Will you put preena on the phone?

286
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:11,441
Okay. Goodbye, miss Isabel.

287
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:12,480
Bye, jai.

288
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,278
So? What do you think?

289
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:23,491
I think we could get 100 beds for what
they're paying for this hotel suite.

290
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,490
I hope this wasn't too good to be true.

291
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:29,835
- I'm not coming back without a suitcase full of...
- A suitcase full of money, I know.

292
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,169
Can I call you back?

293
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,749
Excuse me. What's...? What's going on here?

294
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:39,219
Miss young thought you might need a dress.
For the wedding.

295
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:54,189
- Mom, please.
- Sorry.

296
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,692
You look beautiful, honey.

297
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:58,905
You've told me that.

298
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,160
Like, a lot.

299
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,361
Because it's true, you do.

300
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:05,988
- You look really beautiful.
- Thank you.

301
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,905
Grace and Jonathan,

302
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:49,035
today you're here to
engage in a shared path.

303
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:05,010
Life will throw you its ups and downs...

304
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,845
Be patient with each other,

305
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:15,646
knowing that change happens
slowly and gradually.

306
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:19,190
Seek inspiration from
your family and friends.

307
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:22,986
To make this relationship
work will take love.

308
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:26,701
This is the core of your marriage
and why you are here today.

309
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:32,458
It will take trust to know that in your hearts
you truly want what's best for each other.

310
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:38,839
It will take dedication to stay open to one
another, and to learn and grow together.

311
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:45,304
It will take faith to go forward together
without knowing exactly what the future brings.

312
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:46,888
It will take commitment

313
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:50,476
to hold to the journey that
you've both pledged to today.

314
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:53,224
Rings, please.

315
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,317
Thank you.

316
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,402
Grace and Jonathan, it is my humble honor
and divine pleasure

317
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,120
to pronounce you husband and wife.

318
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,614
Congratulations!

319
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,478
So this one of his sculptures?

320
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,147
Yeah, he made it for them. It's
an original piece. “Wonderful.

321
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,655
Thank you.

322
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:26,942
And...

323
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,236
Because it's a special occasion,

324
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,657
you may have them, but before dinner...

325
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,245
- But tonight you enjoy.
- You enjoy.

326
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,253
Good.

327
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,631
All right?

328
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:46,838
- Mom said...
- Oh, yeah. No, we need a picture.

329
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,840
- We got to go. Picture.
- Graciel!

330
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,760
- Get in here, honey.
- A little bit more that way?

331
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:55,931
- Yeah, this way. She wants to get the light right.
- Okay.

332
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,848
She's an artist.

333
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,721
- Perfect.
- Everybody smile.

334
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:01,849
Thank you.

335
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,691
- How about you with your parents?
- Okay.

336
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,356
So, what do you say?

337
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,570
All right. All right, perfect.

338
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,392
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

339
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,731
What are you doing here?

340
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,943
Hi. Good, you made it.

341
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:51,156
I was a little bit late. I missed the
first part. The traffic. We were stuck...

342
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:55,368
That's okay. You're here now. That's all
that matters. You met my husband? Yeah?

343
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:58,614
So Isabel runs an orphanage in India
that I'm thinking of funding.

344
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:03,161
Yeah. I thought it'd be
nice if she could come. Yeah.

345
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,878
Mom, should I change my
dress before dinner?

346
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:09,795
No, because people like to see the bride
in her beautiful dress. It looks so good.

347
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:13,011
This is our daughter, grace.
This is Isabel.

348
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,595
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

349
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:18,012
- It's a beautiful dress.
- Let's double-check that playlist before it starts.

350
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,305
- Okay? Cool. Hey!
- Yeah, sure.

351
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,725
- I'm glad you could make it.
- Thank you for having me.

352
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,188
- Let's get a picture.
- Okay.

353
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,807
- Yeah.
- Okay. All right. Here we go.

354
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,810
- Oh, dad. Come on.
- All together. Tight.

355
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,186
- No, you.
- Oh, Isabel, you too.

356
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,687
- Yeah.
- Tight, tight.

357
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,860
- Come on, let's do it.
- Perfect.

358
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,028
And...

359
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,158
Perfect.

360
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:40,326
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

361
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,574
- Congratulations.
- Let's go party like it's 2019.

362
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,577
Get in there. Have fun.
You too. Come on.

363
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:46,749
- Don't be shy.
- Yes. Everybody.

364
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,338
I want to make sure
that you get some candids too, all right?

365
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,348
- Oatmeal.
- Hamburgers.

366
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,263
I'm on this paleo thing.

367
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:08,483
Training for a tri in
Hawaii on the big island.

368
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:14,690
Hi. Hello. I want to welcome you all.

369
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,408
I thought the saying "I do"
part would be the hardest.

370
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,537
When I started working for Theresa,

371
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:29,003
I thought I was just getting a great job

372
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:32,465
for one of the most forward-thinking
entrepreneurs I had ever read about.

373
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:33,879
But very quickly,

374
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:36,924
I came to dread coming in to work.

375
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:38,092
It wasn't my boss's fault.

376
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,011
Well, sort of, it was.

377
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:45,388
You see, two years ago,
grace started coming in with Theresa.

378
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,889
She was working in the design
department for the summer.

379
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,893
She's an amazing artist, for
those of you who don't know.

380
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:53,691
Yeah, we know!

381
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,733
Anyway...

382
00:33:56,743 --> 00:34:02,238
I saw them coming through the lobby,
these two beautiful, powerful women,

383
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:03,864
and I froze.

384
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,912
- Which one is he in love with?
- But I spent the next month

385
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,333
doing everything I could to just be in the
same place at the same time as grace.

386
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:14,291
And, finally, I braved an
elevator ride with her.

387
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,468
Do you remember my genius banter?

388
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,587
"What floor?"

389
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,884
Yeah, it was not good.

390
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,425
Until one day,

391
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,301
- I got lucky.
- Hey!

392
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,803
All right, not like that.

393
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:32,392
We were in standing line at the
company pub. She was in front of me.

394
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,861
And she had forgotten her wallet.

395
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,775
So I paid.

396
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:39,946
And it was the best $14 that I ever spent.

397
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:44,701
Grace, I love you more than anything.

398
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:47,165
And I couldn't be happier
that you agreed to marry me.

399
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,378
All right!

400
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,296
It's gonna be a fun honeymoon.

401
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:02,471
Hi.

402
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,841
Hi. You're not quite free yet.

403
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,060
Jonathan,

404
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:10,149
I love you.

405
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,434
And I'm so happy to be your wife.

406
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,854
I can't believe I can say that now.

407
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:22,276
But this this speech isn't for you.

408
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:24,369
It's for my mom and dad.

409
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,040
Dad.

410
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:31,163
I don't know a girl who is closer
to her father than I am with you.

411
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:35,001
And I am so grateful for that...

412
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,544
Most of the time.

413
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,135
I've gotten so much from you.

414
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,723
My sulking.

415
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:47,843
And my sense of humor.

416
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,807
Unfortunately, my nose.

417
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,899
And thank you for the beautiful sculpture.

418
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:57,895
Yeah. I don't know if it's grace and me
or grace and her dad.

419
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,360
- Jonathan.
- I'm kidding, of course. Absolutely.

420
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:03,987
Mom.

421
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:07,825
You've made this night so special.

422
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,580
You are...

423
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,167
The most caring,

424
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,294
loving,

425
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:19,211
best example of a woman
I could have ever asked for in a mother.

426
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:20,299
Thank you.

427
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:27,473
And for those of you who don't know,

428
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:31,265
I had the rare experience
of getting to choose my own mother.

429
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:34,605
It was just me and my dad for
the first year of my life.

430
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:39,937
My dad and I went everywhere together,
with me strapped to his chest.

431
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,813
And one day,

432
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:44,612
we were walking down the street in soho,

433
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,526
and this...

434
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:50,622
This beautiful woman with bright red hair

435
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,786
had just moved to the neighborhood.

436
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:56,662
I guess we looked like locals,
so she asked if we knew of a place

437
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:58,004
to get a good cup of coffee.

438
00:36:58,675 --> 00:36:59,915
And what did you say?

439
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,216
"I don't drink coffee. I don't know."

440
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:08,011
Right. Yeah. And that would have been that,
except I grabbed hold of her hair

441
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:10,349
and I wouldn't let her go.

442
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:15,180
Mom, I'm so happy that I chose you.

443
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:24,481
To my parents, for this wonderful life

444
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,073
and this beautiful night.

445
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,738
- Right.
- Cheers.

446
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,202
Cheers!

447
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,321
- Cheers!
- We're toasting.

448
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,453
Cheers.

449
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:36,372
Cheers.

450
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,459
Cheers.

451
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:40,797
Cheers.

452
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:57,180
I couldn't agree more. I
am not into weddings.

453
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:03,186
- I'd like to be alone.
- Tell me about it. Crowds are awful.

454
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:12,947
Okay, I can take one for the
team and drink them both.

455
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:22,961
You know how at every wedding,
there's always a few single people

456
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:25,761
well...

457
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,052
We're those people.

458
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:30,964
It's weird, right”?

459
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:34,559
I'm divorced. What's your story?

460
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:38,805
Get away from me.

461
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:42,236
Okay.

462
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,107
Excuse me. I think I need
some sodas or something.

463
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,247
- What did you do?
- Fireworks time!

464
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:44,621
Let's head down to the beach
and continue this party!

465
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,298
- I can't talk to you about this right now.
- Dad!

466
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:52,546
Oscar! The fireworks!

467
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:55,094
I'm... Isabel, I'm gonna call you tomorrow.

468
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,231
Oh, my gosh.

469
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:39,736
I didn't know.

470
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,114
I didn't know it was her.

471
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,143
Let's see what they got us.

472
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:06,433
It's just two lines:

473
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:10,559
"Here's to the year. Here's to
an extra special anniversary."

474
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:13,653
- I think it's a blanket?
- Maybe.

475
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:16,068
- What do you think, grace?
- I think it's a tablecloth.

476
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,940
Oh, yeah? I think it's a cape.

477
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,692
Yeah.
'Whatever it is, it's nice.

478
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:23,117
- It's a cape, right?
- It's from one of our lawyers.

479
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:24,864
- Sorry.
- Does it have a return receipt?

480
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:27,083
Might be a matching hat in there.

481
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:28,701
- Somebody's at the door.
- Hold on.

482
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:32,251
- Was there anything else in there?
- No, just some of this.

483
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:40,891
Please come in.

484
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:50,772
Wait here, okay?

485
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,436
I'm gonna do something with it.
I'm gonna go.

486
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:57,234
Should we start with the flamingos?
Or should we start...?

487
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,947
- Hey.
- Gonna go with this one.

488
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:01,818
Who made this? Did you make this?

489
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:05,207
Hi.

490
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:08,287
- Hi.
- Isabel, right?

491
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:12,041
Thank you for coming yesterday.

492
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,379
Thanks for having me.

493
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:16,294
- I told you that I would call you.
- But you didn't.

494
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,918
- Can I get you something to drink?
- No.

495
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,795
Why don't we show you around?
Yeah.

496
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:22,422
Is everything okay? Yeah.

497
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:26,176
Everything's fine. But keep opening presents
because otherwise we'll be here all week.

498
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:36,648
Okay.

499
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:38,692
What do you want?

500
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,314
I want to know why my daughter...

501
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,570
Is in the other room.

502
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,706
How do you live with yourself?

503
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:57,048
A lot more easily than if I had left her
with someone else to raise.

504
00:43:57,844 --> 00:44:00,301
So how did that even happen?

505
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,967
Because... because we decided
that we couldn't keep the baby.

506
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:06,011
- No, you decided.
- No, you agreed.

507
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,809
No, no, no. I was a kid.

508
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:09,768
Exactly.

509
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:12,684
We decided to give her up for adoption

510
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:16,105
because we decided that was
the best thing for her.

511
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:18,899
- Isabel, we tried to find you. We...
- No, you didn't. You didn't.

512
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:22,398
If you'd wanted to find me, you could
have found me. You wanted to be the hero.

513
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,321
Oh, don't talk to her like that!

514
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:28,912
You didn't want to be found. You ran the
second they let you out of the hospital.

515
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,247
You're goddamn right I did.

516
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:32,958
You know how painful that decision
was to make. You were there.

517
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:35,624
I don't remember it being that hard.

518
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,292
Or if it was, you didn't tell me.

519
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,541
You just shut down. You
turned into some zombie.

520
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:42,043
So that gives you the right
to raise her behind my back

521
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:45,387
because I was conflicted about being
a mother when I was 18 years old?

522
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:49,634
"Conflicted"? You went crazy. One second, telling
me what a great life we were gonna have,

523
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:52,387
- the next, how you wanted to kill yourself.
- I never said that.

524
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:53,763
- You did.
- I never said that!

525
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,685
- You said it to my face!
- I never said that!

526
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:58,856
All right, all right, calm down.
Please, quiet.

527
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:02,984
Hey.

528
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:05,278
Come on. It's all good.

529
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:07,735
Please don't do that.

530
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:20,256
Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna keep her?

531
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:31,676
I didn't know until after you were gone,
and by then, it was too late.

532
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,349
And I couldn't find you.

533
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:42,312
I'm not gonna justify myself to you.
I don't owe you anything.

534
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:45,106
You tell her, or I will.

535
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:47,259
At every moment, I made the
best decision that I could.

536
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:49,219
It was very complicated, grace.

537
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,805
- You just don't understand.
- No, you're fucking right.

538
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,515
- I don't understand.
- Don't curse at me.

539
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:57,770
It was a lot to manage. I did my best.

540
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,513
And this...

541
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:01,140
Story...

542
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,892
Just kind of developed.

543
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:07,776
Do you think that I made it up on purpose?

544
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:11,150
I didn't want you to know that your mom
gave you up, so I told you that she died.

545
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,491
Can you not understand that?

546
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:19,458
A little girl. I didn't want you
to feel that hurt and that pain.

547
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:21,373
You don't think I feel that anyway?

548
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:24,630
You don't think that I feel incomplete?

549
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:28,001
You had no right to do what you did,

550
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:31,345
and it is not my job to make
you feel better about it.

551
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:32,429
And I won't.

552
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:35,300
What hotel?

553
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,951
Are you sure you want to do this?

554
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,948
You already have a really great mom.

555
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:02,164
Grace, I... I just mean...

556
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,546
I'll wait for you.

557
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:15,783
Come in. Please.

558
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,216
Can I...?

559
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,504
Get you something to drink?
We have everything.

560
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,386
Yeah, okay.

561
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:38,266
I'll take that.

562
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:40,633
You know what, I have a glass.

563
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,225
My dad said that you were dead.

564
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:53,688
Well, I'm not.

565
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:56,201
Yeah.

566
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:01,873
Thanks.

567
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:07,706
What's this...? Taste like?

568
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,668
It's like fancy orange soda, I guess.

569
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:19,262
Have a sip.

570
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:21,809
Okay.

571
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,022
It's sweet.

572
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:37,322
You don't have this in India?

573
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:39,702
No, we have...

574
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:41,704
Artos.

575
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:43,870
But not so much at the orphanage.

576
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,450
I have so many questions.

577
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,461
How long are you here for?

578
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,713
- Do you have time to meet?
- Yeah, of course.

579
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,136
- I'd love that.
- Okay.

580
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:06,014
I can... I can call you.

581
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:08,604
Now that I know you exist.

582
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,603
I can... I can call you too.

583
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:12,610
Yeah.

584
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,651
Do...? Do you have a phone?
Yeah.

585
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:37,802
Great.

586
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,295
Okay.

587
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:44,424
I should go because
Jonathan's waiting for me.

588
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:45,435
Okay.

589
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,181
Okay.

590
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:56,821
See you.

591
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,396
- Okay.
- Oh, let me get that for you.

592
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:04,660
- See you.
- Bye.

593
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:23,800
I want you to lead the
meditation when I'm gone.

594
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,221
Would you like that? You can
show the others how it's done?

595
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:31,762
Come on, I can teach you.

596
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:35,978
It's easy. Look.

597
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:38,269
Just close your eyes.

598
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,032
Close your eyes.

599
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:45,036
There.

600
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,454
See, now, but they're not really closed.

601
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:53,246
They're looking on the inside of you,
and only you can see that.

602
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,587
I see the dark.

603
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:00,924
No, no, really look. You can
see everyone that you love.

604
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:05,638
And then with your imagination...

605
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:07,597
You can create anything.

606
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:11,302
And then do you hear the drum?

607
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:12,313
The...

608
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:17,896
That... that is not a drum.

609
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,564
No? What's that?

610
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,311
That's my heart.

611
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,822
I thought this place might
remind you of home.

612
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,240
That was probably stupid.

613
00:53:33,252 --> 00:53:35,368
No, it was thoughtful.

614
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:37,711
Jonathan took me here on
one of our first dates.

615
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:39,831
It seemed exotic then.

616
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:43,129
You two seem very happy.

617
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:45,388
Yeah.

618
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:51,179
To tell you the truth, it's kind of hard
to think straight about anything right now.

619
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:52,926
Yeah, I know what you mean.

620
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,223
Some chutney.

621
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,231
Thank you.

622
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:04,985
So do I have any brothers or
sisters I don't know about?

623
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:07,198
No. Well...

624
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,829
There is this one little boy at the
orphanage that I've pretty much raised.

625
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:15,165
We found him by the side of
the road when he was just 1.

626
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:17,705
How old is he now?

627
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:19,374
Eight next week.

628
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:26,131
He loves birds.

629
00:54:26,138 --> 00:54:27,674
And he...

630
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:31,344
He wants to be a professional
football player when he grows up.

631
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:32,511
Soccer, you mean.

632
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,180
Soccer!

633
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:35,188
Yes.

634
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,482
I brought some photos with
me if you want to see them.

635
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:42,351
- I would love that.
- Okay.

636
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,281
Here.

637
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:48,490
Okay.

638
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:49,779
I et's see.

639
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:56,533
So that's when we went to a ranch...

640
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,204
In the summer.

641
00:54:58,212 --> 00:55:01,420
Cute. Such a cute kid.

642
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:09,087
Oh, we built a snow fort in the backyard.

643
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,552
That's a terrified little reindeer.
Yeah.

644
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:19,565
Oh, yeah.

645
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:21,852
That was my birthday.

646
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,475
I'm decorating cupcakes.

647
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:24,647
Fun. Yeah.

648
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,824
I don't think that I could give up a baby.

649
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,967
It wasn't in my plans either.

650
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:56,885
I just knew I couldn't take care of you
and that bringing you into the world

651
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,305
was the best I could do.

652
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:12,904
That was the first day of third grade.

653
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,407
Cibele, there was a nest in my closet.

654
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,241
- Did you move it?
- A nest?

655
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:38,985
A bird's nest with little blue eggs.

656
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:40,578
- Did you move it?
- No, no.

657
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:42,243
- I didn't see that.
- You... all right.

658
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:45,910
I do appreciate the interest,
but I think I'm gonna hang on to the ap.

659
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:48,333
But I'm happy to show you
new stuff I'm working on.

660
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:53,630
And that's cool. But jamey is willing to pay secondary
if we could figure out something not totally...

661
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:55,628
- Hey.
- Theresa. Jamey, Andre.

662
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:58,551
- They're looking at some of the new stuff.
- Did you take that from me?

663
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:02,225
- Oh, yeah. I found it in your closet.
- What were you doing in my closet?

664
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:05,892
I was replacing a light bulb.
The nest looked like it was falling apart.

665
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,981
- I was gonna repair it.
- You don't have to fix everything.

666
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,475
You're not the handyman.

667
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:19,239
Downside to working at home. I'll show you
a sketch of the stuff I'm working on.

668
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:22,787
I want to revisit that.

669
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:24,076
- We will.
- All right.

670
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:40,846
Good.

671
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:42,716
Sit down.

672
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:44,434
I'm celebrating.

673
00:58:44,438 --> 00:58:46,645
I officially sold my company.

674
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:49,139
- Can we have two more, please?
- Of course, miss young.

675
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:51,437
No, thank you. You don't drink?

676
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,646
- Not in the middle of the day, no.
- Not at the wedding either.

677
00:58:56,408 --> 00:58:59,900
Oscar said that you guys partied a lot
back in the day. Is that why?

678
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:05,831
Theresa? Just wanted to stop
by and say congratulations.

679
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:08,576
- Heard you made out pretty well.
- Is that a surprise?

680
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:12,705
Now I'm just a very, very,
very rich employee.

681
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:17,926
This is my friend, Isabel.
This is Richard and Eddie.

682
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:22,468
I'm about to donate a small fortune
to the orphanage Isabel runs in India.

683
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:27,018
- Now I feel bad about myself.
- Well, it's about time.

684
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:30,898
- Congratulations again.
- Nice to see you. Thanks.

685
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:35,185
I assumed,

686
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:36,733
after the other night,

687
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:39,277
- that that was no longer...
- It makes more sense now.

688
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:41,024
We're practically family.

689
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:42,742
We'll have the sole.

690
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:44,782
- You'll love it.
- Thank you.

691
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,583
- Why are you doing this?
- Because I want to.

692
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,122
Why can't you just be grateful?

693
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:54,496
Because I know when things
seem too good to be true.

694
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:58,046
I think the only thing you need to know is
what to do with the money.

695
00:59:58,053 --> 01:00:00,760
So it's a good day. A
good day for both of us.

696
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:05,015
Was it strange to see Oscar again?

697
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,893
I mean, does he look different now?

698
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:13,807
I don't remember.

699
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:15,559
Come on. I mean, he's...

700
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:19,154
He's a good-looking man
now, but back then...

701
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:21,113
He must've really been something.

702
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:27,241
You knew who I was when you invited me
to come here, didn't you?

703
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:29,615
No, I did not.

704
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:34,120
All I knew is what my people told me, that
there was a good charitable opportunity.

705
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:36,213
- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.

706
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:40,177
What do you want?

707
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:44,550
- Hi. I'm so sorry to interrupt.
- Oh, then why are you?

708
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:47,971
You have your conference call. I tried
texting, but you weren't responding.

709
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:51,095
Well, I'm not available
now, so push the call.

710
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:54,064
- You specifically asked me to schedule it for Monday.
- Jesus Christ.

711
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:56,228
Do I work for you, or do you work for me?

712
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:59,023
- Which one is it?
- Iwork for you.

713
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:04,650
Yes, you work for me. So push the fucking call.
If you can't, don't come in tomorrow. Thank you.

714
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:09,954
I'm sorry. God, I'm so sorry about that.

715
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:14,334
Grace told me that you two had dinner,

716
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:17,704
and I just wanted to say that
I'm glad that's happening.

717
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:41,269
- Gwen dropped these off for you.
- Thank you.

718
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:44,523
- She also wanted to see if you're okay.
- Yeah, fine.

719
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:50,487
I decided to go ahead and
finance Isabel's orphanage.

720
01:01:55,003 --> 01:01:56,368
You gonna say anything?

721
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,376
I'm sure she'll be very happy about it.

722
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:04,008
You're perfect for each other.

723
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:06,799
- What?
- I said, you're perfect for each other.

724
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:10,924
- What is that supposed to mean?
- She didn't seem that grateful either.

725
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:16,475
I'm gonna assume that this
is the vodka talking.

726
01:02:17,025 --> 01:02:18,140
Good solution.

727
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:20,187
No responsibility that way.

728
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:30,281
You know that you're not the only
one affected by this, right?

729
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:39,954
- Just don't go up to the boys' room like this.
- Don't tell me what to do.

730
01:02:39,965 --> 01:02:44,459
And don't tell me how to be a mother because
it's not like you're the better parent.

731
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:47,336
And I'm sick and tired

732
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:50,839
of that single-dad story
you keep telling...

733
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:53,057
Because you didn't do it on your own.

734
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:46,107
Hi. I want to apologize.

735
01:03:46,114 --> 01:03:48,901
I was awful. Hope I didn't scare you.

736
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:51,115
- Oh, it takes more than that.
- Please.

737
01:03:52,704 --> 01:03:55,912
- Can you tell them I'm gonna be 15 minutes late?
- Sure.

738
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:05,376
I have decided to amend my offer.

739
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:09,001
I'd like to make it
significantly more generous.

740
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:13,255
It will require you to stay a few more days
while the details are being worked out.

741
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:15,678
- No, I can't stay. I have to get home.
- I do understand,

742
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:18,017
but the circumstances have changed, and...

743
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:21,730
I think this is too important
to be a one-off donation.

744
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:25,267
Obviously, it means a lot to me
that you're grace's biological mother,

745
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:30,238
so I have talked to my lawyers
about establishing a fund.

746
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:33,825
It would be in both your and grace's name.
You would run it together.

747
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:36,695
And I was thinking 20
million over six years.

748
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:41,200
From the research I did, that
would cover 50,000 kids a year.

749
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:44,294
For medication, education or housing,

750
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:48,290
whatever you need, including
the local farming thing.

751
01:04:50,512 --> 01:04:52,048
What's in it for you?

752
01:04:56,935 --> 01:05:00,519
Just stay. Just stay a little bit
so we can work out the details.

753
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:03,434
You can spend time with grace,
get to know her better.

754
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:09,607
I'm gonna take my boys to D.C. for the weekend
to see my sister, so why don't you...?

755
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:11,821
Why don't you go out there while I'm gone?

756
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:13,992
Talk to Oscar.

757
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:19,738
I'm sure you have a lot to talk about.

758
01:05:23,545 --> 01:05:25,456
- Is my dad in there?
- He's on the path.

759
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,875
He's on the trail? Okay. Thank you.
Yes.

760
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:58,860
Dad!

761
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:04,115
What are you doing out here?

762
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:09,003
I was just thinking.

763
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:11,544
I hate fighting with you.

764
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:19,805
You think you're ever gonna forgive me?

765
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,010
What's my other option?

766
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:30,350
But I want to know everything.

767
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:43,364
When you give a child up for adoption,
you've got 30 days to change your mind.

768
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:49,168
A grace period.

769
01:06:53,176 --> 01:06:56,134
How long did it take you
to decide to come get me?

770
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:00,630
Twenty-nine days.

771
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:04,892
We agreed...

772
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:08,726
That once you were born,
we would both leave.

773
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:13,018
She kept her end of the bargain,

774
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,565
and I meant to,

775
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:17,814
but I thought I would just...

776
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:22,740
Yeah, go over and visit you for an hour.

777
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:26,205
And then I couldn't stop going.

778
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,705
Just staring at you...

779
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:32,044
Talking to you.

780
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:36,093
So...

781
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:40,136
Did you marry mom for my sake?

782
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:44,306
- So that I'd have a mother?
- No.

783
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:46,471
I married her because I loved her.

784
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:50,190
Do you?

785
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:53,902
I do.

786
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:01,233
I'm sorry, Gracie.

787
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:11,960
You guys think you're strong
enough to get this one? Yeah.

788
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:14,500
- This is heavy.
- Yeah, that's because of the shoes.

789
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:17,624
You need lots and lots of shoes
when you're visiting so many museums.

790
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:19,341
- No!
- No, I'm kidding.

791
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:20,835
- Maximum, three.
- Please, don't.

792
01:08:20,847 --> 01:08:22,883
- Still, that's too many.
- Hey, guys,

793
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:25,131
- the snacks are in the back.
- Okay, and just...

794
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:28,306
Put it in the back and then jump in
the car. I don't want to hit traffic.

795
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:30,349
- Okay. Bye, dad.
- Why don't you take the train?

796
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:32,312
Then you don't have to worry about traffic.

797
01:08:32,317 --> 01:08:34,979
- Or crashing.
- No, I want to drive.

798
01:08:34,986 --> 01:08:39,195
I like to be alone with them
because they talk to you in the car.

799
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:41,234
See? I'm listening, even
when you think I'm not.

800
01:08:42,577 --> 01:08:43,987
- Say hi to your sister.
- I will.

801
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:47,738
- Be careful.
- Yeah, of course. I'm gonna be careful. Of course.

802
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:51,458
Hey, shorties! Let me give you a hand.
Here you go.

803
01:09:14,776 --> 01:09:15,776
Hi.

804
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:23,492
So...

805
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:28,240
Do you know about this fund
that Theresa asked me to administer?

806
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:32,286
That's what you came for, right?
With grace? I'd run it with grace?

807
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:39,627
I don't even think that grace knows.
I don't know if it's real. I don't know...

808
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:43,172
- To be honest with you, I don't trust your wife.
- You don't trust my wife?

809
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:46,387
She's gonna give you money for your charity
and you're gonna question her integrity, huh?

810
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:48,302
Twenty million dollars?

811
01:09:55,358 --> 01:09:56,438
Is it real?

812
01:09:58,277 --> 01:10:00,734
You don't have to be poor
to have good intentions.

813
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:03,821
- There are people with money and principles, okay?
- Really?

814
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:08,701
- That's not what I remember you saying when I knew you.
- That's because I was an idiotic idealist.

815
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:09,820
But I grew up.

816
01:10:11,666 --> 01:10:12,701
Did you?

817
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:15,252
No.

818
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,831
Theresa doesn't care about the orphanage.

819
01:10:21,843 --> 01:10:24,755
She doesn't want to talk about it.
She's interested in business.

820
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:26,593
So, what does she want?

821
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:32,433
Give grace some direction? I don't know.

822
01:10:32,437 --> 01:10:33,847
I don't know.

823
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:34,935
I don't know.

824
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:39,399
Appears to be a running
theme for me these days.

825
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:49,363
Well, join the club.

826
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:58,034
I looked at your work online.

827
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:02,799
Yeah?

828
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:04,957
Yeah. It's...

829
01:11:06,888 --> 01:11:08,469
Really bad.

830
01:11:17,148 --> 01:11:18,308
How do you choose?

831
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:24,022
Can't describe it, really.

832
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,611
Can't or don't want to?

833
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:27,616
Both.

834
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:29,736
Fair enough.

835
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,581
Certain rocks kind of glow to me.

836
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:46,551
Like an aura?

837
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:52,432
Maybe.

838
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:57,093
So then those are the ones you take?

839
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:00,471
Not at first, no.

840
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:03,107
I leave them there...

841
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:06,398
And then I go back.

842
01:12:09,617 --> 01:12:12,199
And if it's still...

843
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:14,496
Lighting up,

844
01:12:14,914 --> 01:12:16,199
then I take them.

845
01:12:20,211 --> 01:12:21,542
Is that what happened?

846
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:27,335
With grace? She was lighting up?

847
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:04,805
Are you gonna meet us at nobu,
or you want to come by the office?

848
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:06,351
For what?

849
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:07,815
For dinner.

850
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:10,309
With Ben and xandy.

851
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:13,320
What are you doing?

852
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:17,699
Is that India?

853
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:19,989
Yeah. I thought we could go.

854
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:21,862
When?

855
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:23,159
For our honeymoon.

856
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:25,912
They're supposed to have great hotels.

857
01:14:27,004 --> 01:14:28,619
We're going to Costa Rica.

858
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:30,462
I want to surf.

859
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:33,378
Yeah, I know, I know, but
maybe we could do both.

860
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:36,252
India's too far, babe.

861
01:14:36,263 --> 01:14:37,924
I can't take that much time off work.

862
01:14:37,932 --> 01:14:40,469
We just said we were gonna
be gone for a week.

863
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:44,139
Maybe you could go for a week
and I could stay for longer.

864
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:47,058
So you want to be alone in India?

865
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:49,933
Because I think you...
You hate being alone.

866
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:53,394
I won't be alone. I'll be with Isabel.

867
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:57,027
Yeah.

868
01:14:57,034 --> 01:14:59,275
I know. I'm not stupid.

869
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:02,328
Why are you being so shitty?

870
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:03,446
Me?

871
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:08,663
Grace, how do you think it feels
to get married to somebody,

872
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:11,333
and then a week later,
have them turn into a different person?

873
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:15,921
Did you just think that I was
gonna stay the same forever?

874
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:19,045
- Jesus Christ, grace, that's not what I'm saying.
- What are you saying?

875
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:21,763
That you can't just change things
now, okay? She gave you up.

876
01:15:28,983 --> 01:15:30,519
I'm sorry.

877
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:31,732
I got to go, okay?

878
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:00,983
Aardvark? Good one.

879
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:02,777
- Oh, no, it's your turn.
- Cheetah.

880
01:17:02,785 --> 01:17:04,491
- Yeah, that's good.
- Lion.

881
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:08,119
Deer.

882
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:09,489
Camel.

883
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,990
Octopus.

884
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:14,118
That... does an octopus count as an animal?

885
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:16,416
- Kind... yeah!
- Okay. All right.

886
01:17:16,423 --> 01:17:18,288
- It's a sea creature.
- Otter. I say otter.

887
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,756
Otter? Shark.

888
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,296
Dog.

889
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:22,303
Chicken.

890
01:17:23,222 --> 01:17:24,132
Crocodile.

891
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:25,425
- Panther.
- Okay.

892
01:17:25,432 --> 01:17:26,717
All right, guys.

893
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:30,638
Dad! Daddy!

894
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:32,762
Hi, baby. Hey, hey, hey!

895
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:35,351
Daddy, look what we won.

896
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,691
- They're huge.
- They're huge, right?

897
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:39,310
- Yeah.
- How did you win these?

898
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:44,111
There was a lovely go-kart track off the
highway, and they had carnival games.

899
01:17:44,118 --> 01:17:47,736
Mom said the games were a waste of time,
so she bought them.

900
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:51,489
It smelled like feet and hot dogs in there,
and I wanted to beat the traffic.

901
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,365
Thanks, George Washington.

902
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:56,369
Hey, you guys, go upstairs
and take a bath. Okay?

903
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:58,712
And then afterwards, you
can play one video game.

904
01:17:58,716 --> 01:17:59,922
- Can we pick?
- Can we pick?

905
01:17:59,925 --> 01:18:01,540
Daddy's gonna pick, okay?

906
01:18:01,552 --> 01:18:03,713
Go upstairs and wash those stinky feet.

907
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:05,382
- Okay.
- Will you take this upstairs?

908
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:07,129
I have to run into the office.

909
01:18:07,141 --> 01:18:10,258
- I will be back for dinner. All right?
- Hey, wait...

910
01:18:10,269 --> 01:18:11,725
I talked to your doctor.

911
01:18:14,732 --> 01:18:16,688
You've known about this for three months?

912
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:20,396
She spoke to you?

913
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:21,404
Yeah.

914
01:18:22,323 --> 01:18:24,905
That's a breach of
doctor-patient confidentiality.

915
01:18:24,909 --> 01:18:26,865
- I could sue her.
- She figured I already knew

916
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:30,157
because you promised her you'd
tell me after the wedding.

917
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:31,904
I don't have time for this right now.

918
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:36,455
Theresa. Honey, we have to talk about this.

919
01:18:36,462 --> 01:18:37,793
- No. No, we...
- Yeah, yeah.

920
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:40,412
- I have nothing to talk about.
- We have to talk about this.

921
01:18:40,424 --> 01:18:42,255
- Let me go. I have to get to work.
- Let you go?

922
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:44,716
- Let me go.
- I'm your husband! I'm never gonna let you go!

923
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:52,424
Don't tell grace and the boys.

924
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:53,926
- Baby...
- Don't tell them.

925
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:02,397
- We'll figure something out.
- I have figured it out.

926
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:05,441
There's got to be some kind
of experimental treatment or testing...

927
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:06,859
There's not. I've looked.

928
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:10,610
There's nothing. There's nothing that
wouldn't just prolong it or make it worse.

929
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:13,954
I don't want you to see me that way
and I don't want them to see me that way.

930
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:16,402
So you just want me to do nothing.

931
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:20,165
We don't get to choose. Let me go.

932
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:39,931
Happy birthday to you

933
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:43,400
happy birthday to you

934
01:19:43,404 --> 01:19:46,737
happy birthday, dear jai

935
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:50,232
happy birthday to you

936
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:55,287
we'll do the ice cream how.

937
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:56,371
Tell them I said:

938
01:19:57,835 --> 01:19:59,075
Isabel,

939
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:01,293
you're doing something important.

940
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:04,167
Good luck.

941
01:20:04,174 --> 01:20:05,174
Bye.

942
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:12,638
So there are a couple of
points I don't understand.

943
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:14,927
Okay. Let's see.

944
01:20:20,441 --> 01:20:25,026
If you and grace can't agree on how funds are
distributed, Oscar gets a tie-breaking vote.

945
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:28,738
- I thought it'd be better if it wasn't me.
- Yeah, no. Not that. This.

946
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:29,947
It.

947
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:32,612
Says I have to live in New York?

948
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:34,905
But your cost of living
will be taken care of.

949
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:38,326
But I can just come in for board meetings.
I can do the rest on Skype.

950
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:39,949
I'm afraid it's a requirement.

951
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:42,622
Yeah, but that doesn't make any sense. Why?

952
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:47,540
Because you're used to running things
at the orphanage, but you're not accustomed

953
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:50,418
to managing millions of dollars,
so I would like you here.

954
01:21:03,817 --> 01:21:05,933
I'll do six months here and six there.

955
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:07,104
It's nonnegotiable.

956
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:13,024
Please don't... don't waste our time
pretending that you're not gonna do this.

957
01:21:14,745 --> 01:21:16,736
You think I give a shit about your money?

958
01:21:16,747 --> 01:21:18,658
Yes, I do.
You think I'm for sale?

959
01:21:18,665 --> 01:21:21,122
- You wanna buy me?
- No, I don't want to buy you,

960
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:23,833
- I want to give you an opportunity.
- Bullshit!

961
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:28,460
- That's what it says here.
- Call it whatever you want. I don't care.

962
01:21:28,467 --> 01:21:32,130
But just think about what you can do with
the money and all the kids you could help.

963
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:35,550
- I know you'd sell yourself for that.
- You don't know me.

964
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:37,468
Actually, I do.

965
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:40,263
Thirty-nine years old.
Born in Troy, New York.

966
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:43,762
Raised in Connecticut by adoptive parents.
You went to boarding school upstate.

967
01:21:43,774 --> 01:21:47,392
Went to Syracuse for a year, dropped out.
Joined the peace corps. Met Oscar.

968
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:49,735
You're a good person.
You're well-intentioned.

969
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:51,945
You're an idealist. You're just like grace.

970
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:56,070
I have a life.

971
01:21:56,078 --> 01:21:59,821
- Your life will be good here, I promise.
- I have a good life there!

972
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:03,370
You think because you're rich, I'm gonna get
down on my knees and lick your asshole?!

973
01:22:04,503 --> 01:22:08,837
And you think because you're a do-gooder, it makes up
for the fact that you abandoned your child, right?

974
01:22:45,461 --> 01:22:46,667
Isabel!

975
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:48,285
Isabel, I'm sorry!

976
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:49,833
I'm so, so sorry.

977
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:53,503
- Who do you think you are? You're cruel.
- She's your daughter. She needs you.

978
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:55,751
And she needs you here,
and Oscar needs you here.

979
01:22:55,762 --> 01:22:58,048
- You're crazy!
- No. No, I'm sick.

980
01:22:58,056 --> 01:22:59,762
I'm... I'm sick. I'm dying.

981
01:23:03,312 --> 01:23:06,145
I didn't bring you here
just to give you money.

982
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:09,233
What?

983
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:12,730
My boys are 8 years old.

984
01:23:16,617 --> 01:23:17,617
Help me.

985
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:21,405
Please.

986
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:24,620
Help me.

987
01:23:25,876 --> 01:23:28,663
Do I have to be halfway around
the world to get your help?

988
01:24:01,954 --> 01:24:03,319
Grace.

989
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:04,695
Can I talk to you?

990
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:05,741
Yeah, of course.

991
01:24:12,965 --> 01:24:15,422
Have you told your parents how you feel?

992
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:18,626
No. I can't.

993
01:24:18,637 --> 01:24:21,299
They thought I was too
young to get married.

994
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:22,716
They were right.

995
01:24:24,351 --> 01:24:26,512
God, I wish I wasn't married.

996
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:31,513
Can you tell me what to do?

997
01:24:34,278 --> 01:24:35,688
No, grace, I can't.

998
01:24:35,696 --> 01:24:36,856
Please.

999
01:24:36,863 --> 01:24:41,448
Everyone's gonna hate me if I get divorced, but
I don't... I don't know if I can stay married.

1000
01:24:53,046 --> 01:24:54,411
It's your life.

1001
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:56,872
You decide.

1002
01:25:01,847 --> 01:25:02,927
Like you did?

1003
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:09,468
Did you even think about
what you were doing to me?!

1004
01:25:17,863 --> 01:25:18,978
I'm sorry.

1005
01:25:23,827 --> 01:25:24,942
I'm sorry.

1006
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:33,742
It's okay.

1007
01:25:33,754 --> 01:25:35,335
It's okay.

1008
01:25:35,339 --> 01:25:36,419
I'm here.

1009
01:26:05,452 --> 01:26:07,192
- Hello.
- It's Isabel.

1010
01:26:07,204 --> 01:26:08,944
Isabel.

1011
01:26:08,955 --> 01:26:10,240
Did we get the money?

1012
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:13,032
Yes.

1013
01:26:13,043 --> 01:26:14,829
It's a miracle.

1014
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:17,043
Let me get jai. We'll celebrate!

1015
01:26:17,047 --> 01:26:18,378
No, no, no.

1016
01:26:19,299 --> 01:26:20,539
What's the matter?

1017
01:26:26,098 --> 01:26:27,133
I'm

1018
01:26:30,936 --> 01:26:34,474
not... I'm not coming back.
I'm staying in New York.

1019
01:26:34,481 --> 01:26:36,688
What do you mean? For how long?

1020
01:26:48,245 --> 01:26:50,031
Hey.

1021
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:51,153
Is she okay?

1022
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:53,910
She's upset.

1023
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:56,908
And confused.

1024
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:59,536
And she feels like she's made a mistake.

1025
01:27:04,094 --> 01:27:05,334
What'd you tell her?

1026
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:08,303
I told her that it was her life.

1027
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:11,636
Thank you for letting her stay with you.

1028
01:27:19,276 --> 01:27:21,232
Gracie.

1029
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:22,476
You're gonna be okay.

1030
01:27:28,994 --> 01:27:30,200
Hey, sleepyhead.

1031
01:27:32,831 --> 01:27:34,571
This is really weird.

1032
01:27:38,295 --> 01:27:39,535
Oh, sure, have some.

1033
01:27:41,006 --> 01:27:42,917
I'll get some more.

1034
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:44,255
Do you want one, dad?

1035
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:45,499
Yeah, thanks.

1036
01:27:47,137 --> 01:27:49,253
Why don't you see if they
have some pastries too?

1037
01:27:54,144 --> 01:27:56,009
She's so sensitive.

1038
01:27:57,522 --> 01:28:00,013
Oscar, you have to tell her about Theresa.

1039
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:09,822
I really... I don't want to...

1040
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:12,526
I don't want to hurt her.

1041
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:19,875
They're bringing the pastries over.

1042
01:28:38,063 --> 01:28:39,063
Thank you.

1043
01:28:40,023 --> 01:28:41,183
Theresa,

1044
01:28:41,191 --> 01:28:42,271
your turn.

1045
01:28:55,705 --> 01:28:58,663
Well... it's official.

1046
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:00,203
I have a lot less money.

1047
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:02,292
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1048
01:29:02,295 --> 01:29:05,207
Thank you, everyone. Thanks so much.

1049
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:08,088
All right.

1050
01:29:09,928 --> 01:29:13,716
- You're changing a lot of people's lives.
- I hope you do everything you want with it.

1051
01:29:16,268 --> 01:29:18,099
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

1052
01:29:18,103 --> 01:29:19,593
Grace is here.

1053
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:22,141
I wasn't expecting her. Send her in.

1054
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:24,685
- I'll just start that 12:30 without you.
- That'd be great.

1055
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:26,103
Isabel, you can stay.

1056
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:28,818
I don't think she's here to see me.

1057
01:29:45,797 --> 01:29:48,504
Hi, sweetheart. I wish I'd
known you were coming.

1058
01:29:48,508 --> 01:29:50,544
I would have cleared myself for lunch...

1059
01:29:53,555 --> 01:29:54,920
Why didn't you tell me?

1060
01:29:57,893 --> 01:29:59,884
Why didn't you tell me yourself?

1061
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:07,099
- You were lying every minute you knew and didn't tell me.
- I'm sorry.

1062
01:30:08,111 --> 01:30:12,195
- I didn't want to make you sad.
- You didn't think I'd be sad if you just died one day?

1063
01:30:12,198 --> 01:30:13,233
No. “What?

1064
01:30:15,744 --> 01:30:17,700
I didn't want anything to change.

1065
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:23,039
Maybe I was wrong.

1066
01:30:27,589 --> 01:30:32,299
If I knew that you were dying, I wouldn't
have spent my time doing other stuff.

1067
01:30:33,929 --> 01:30:37,968
It's okay. Okay. It's okay. You'll be okay.

1068
01:30:37,974 --> 01:30:39,805
No, I don't want to be okay.

1069
01:30:39,809 --> 01:30:42,300
Okay. Isabel will be here.

1070
01:30:42,312 --> 01:30:46,305
- She'll be here.
- I don't care about Isabel. I care about you.

1071
01:30:47,609 --> 01:30:49,691
You're my mom, and I...

1072
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:53,653
If you don't tell me, I can't... I can't
tell you all the things that I want to say.

1073
01:30:53,657 --> 01:30:55,193
What do you want to say?

1074
01:30:56,910 --> 01:30:59,151
I can't tell you that I...

1075
01:30:59,162 --> 01:31:01,744
- That I love you.
- I know you do.

1076
01:31:01,748 --> 01:31:02,908
I love you.

1077
01:31:06,211 --> 01:31:08,122
I don't want you to die.

1078
01:32:00,265 --> 01:32:02,347
This pair always gives me trouble.

1079
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:03,430
Oh, yeah.

1080
01:32:15,196 --> 01:32:16,936
I love being needed.

1081
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:18,605
It makes me horny.

1082
01:32:23,830 --> 01:32:25,161
One more second.

1083
01:32:25,165 --> 01:32:26,165
Thank you.

1084
01:32:31,755 --> 01:32:32,870
Dance party?

1085
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:36,252
- I love to dance.
- Mom, this is serious.

1086
01:32:36,259 --> 01:32:38,045
- Get out of the way!
- Get out of the way!

1087
01:32:38,053 --> 01:32:40,795
It's serious. Oh, sorry. I'll
do some serious dancing.

1088
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:43,296
So there are not many people

1089
01:32:43,308 --> 01:32:47,096
who have the power and tenacity

1090
01:32:47,103 --> 01:32:49,594
to will their vision into existence

1091
01:32:49,606 --> 01:32:53,019
and in the process, change
the way our industry works.

1092
01:32:53,026 --> 01:32:56,484
Not to mention employing over 1000 people
and raising a family

1093
01:32:56,488 --> 01:32:59,855
- and, oh, yeah, making a shit-ton of money.
- Yeah, that's right.

1094
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:06,612
So why sell when you have built
this big, thriving behemoth of a company?

1095
01:33:06,623 --> 01:33:08,409
- Why?
- That's what I want to know.

1096
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:09,496
- Thank you. Right.
- No.

1097
01:33:09,501 --> 01:33:11,913
Why? Why? Why?

1098
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,377
- Why? Why? Why?
- Theresa, why?

1099
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:16,837
Okay, so she did say it is because

1100
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:18,706
she likes beginnings.

1101
01:33:19,511 --> 01:33:22,344
And a little bit of hardship.

1102
01:33:22,347 --> 01:33:25,305
And when things get too easy
for her, she gets bored.

1103
01:33:25,308 --> 01:33:26,673
We bored her.

1104
01:33:26,684 --> 01:33:28,265
You said it, I didn't.

1105
01:33:30,313 --> 01:33:32,895
So congratulations, Theresa.

1106
01:33:32,899 --> 01:33:36,107
You know we love you,
and we can't wait to see what you do next.

1107
01:33:36,111 --> 01:33:39,023
To Theresa. For bringing us all together.

1108
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:41,021
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1109
01:33:43,201 --> 01:33:47,490
Happy birthday to you

1110
01:33:47,497 --> 01:33:50,955
happy birthday to you

1111
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:57,709
- happy birthday, dear Theresa
- Dear mom

1112
01:33:57,715 --> 01:34:02,926
happy birthday to you

1113
01:34:08,226 --> 01:34:10,137
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1114
01:34:10,145 --> 01:34:13,512
Just to be clear, my birthday's
not until next month,

1115
01:34:13,523 --> 01:34:15,479
but thank you for being here

1116
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:19,021
and thank you for this extraordinary cake.

1117
01:34:19,028 --> 01:34:21,394
- Did you make this, babe?
- Yeah, I did.

1118
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:24,773
Your work is generally more abstract
than this and it's pretty figurative,

1119
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:27,947
- so it's a real departure for you.
- First time working with cake.

1120
01:34:30,039 --> 01:34:33,327
As you know, Oscar is a brilliant artist.

1121
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:39,500
I always thought that artists were flaky and impractical,
and I never expected to fall in love with one.

1122
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:40,667
I thought I was...

1123
01:34:40,675 --> 01:34:43,166
I was gonna meet a nice banker,

1124
01:34:43,178 --> 01:34:45,885
but it turns out, there
are no nice bankers.

1125
01:34:48,808 --> 01:34:52,471
Oh, do you know what he said to
me in the car on the way here?

1126
01:34:53,897 --> 01:34:54,977
He said:

1127
01:34:56,941 --> 01:35:00,058
"Is it us moving through the world,

1128
01:35:01,029 --> 01:35:02,894
or the world running past us?"

1129
01:35:06,784 --> 01:35:07,864
To which I said:

1130
01:35:11,289 --> 01:35:14,873
"Let's not take the northern state.
Traffic's terrible at this time."

1131
01:35:16,794 --> 01:35:18,000
But this is...

1132
01:35:18,004 --> 01:35:19,460
This is not about...

1133
01:35:19,464 --> 01:35:21,921
Not about me and my family.

1134
01:35:21,925 --> 01:35:26,589
This is about us and what we have
accomplished together, which is a lot.

1135
01:35:26,596 --> 01:35:30,384
And I know that many people are wondering
what this company is gonna look like now,

1136
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:34,179
and I would be lying to you if I didn't say
that there would be a period of transition.

1137
01:35:35,063 --> 01:35:37,304
But if you say to yourself:

1138
01:35:37,315 --> 01:35:39,556
"I feel uncomfortable,"

1139
01:35:39,567 --> 01:35:41,023
then good.

1140
01:35:41,027 --> 01:35:45,487
Because discomfort brings growth.

1141
01:36:14,686 --> 01:36:17,143
I forgot to tell you the...

1142
01:36:17,146 --> 01:36:18,932
The school called... yeah?

1143
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:21,352
To suggest that we split the boys

1144
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:23,725
into separate classes
after the winter break.

1145
01:36:25,238 --> 01:36:27,320
They think it might be
good for their confidence.

1146
01:36:32,495 --> 01:36:34,827
I just worry about that...

1147
01:36:34,831 --> 01:36:36,617
That one teacher, Janet.

1148
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:39,206
She's a little melancholy for third grade.

1149
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:40,871
Why are you telling me this?

1150
01:36:43,256 --> 01:36:44,621
You okay?

1151
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:47,669
- Let me get you a painkiller, all right?
- No. No.

1152
01:36:47,677 --> 01:36:51,044
I want to know why you're
telling me this about the boys.

1153
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:54,347
Because we have to decide.

1154
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:57,717
No, we don't have to decide anything.
You have to decide.

1155
01:37:00,565 --> 01:37:03,102
It's all done. I did everything I could.

1156
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:08,524
But there's always gonna be more to do
and you're gonna have to do it.

1157
01:37:09,657 --> 01:37:11,443
Because I'm not gonna be here.

1158
01:37:19,459 --> 01:37:21,495
I won't. I won't be here.

1159
01:37:28,009 --> 01:37:31,092
- You think you'll be with her when I'm gone?
- Stop.

1160
01:37:31,095 --> 01:37:32,426
No, I want to know.

1161
01:37:32,430 --> 01:37:34,011
Baby, I love you.

1162
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:44,897
Where do you go?

1163
01:37:49,447 --> 01:37:51,438
You know, where will I... 7?

1164
01:37:51,449 --> 01:37:52,655
Where will I go?

1165
01:37:54,369 --> 01:37:55,609
I don't know.

1166
01:37:59,082 --> 01:38:00,367
I don't want to die.

1167
01:38:03,127 --> 01:38:04,788
I don't want to die.

1168
01:38:06,255 --> 01:38:08,086
I don't...

1169
01:38:08,091 --> 01:38:10,047
I don't want to die.

1170
01:38:11,302 --> 01:38:13,509
I don't want to.

1171
01:38:13,513 --> 01:38:15,344
I'm not done!

1172
01:38:17,767 --> 01:38:21,760
- I'm not done! I'm not done!
- I know. I know, I know.

1173
01:38:21,771 --> 01:38:23,887
I'm not done!

1174
01:38:25,942 --> 01:38:28,103
I know. I know.

1175
01:38:29,112 --> 01:38:30,397
I know you're not.

1176
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:32,989
I know.

1177
01:38:34,325 --> 01:38:36,737
I'm with you, baby. I'm with you.

1178
01:38:36,744 --> 01:38:37,744
I'm with you.

1179
01:41:09,063 --> 01:41:10,143
Isabel.

1180
01:41:13,985 --> 01:41:15,941
So good to see you.

1181
01:41:17,697 --> 01:41:18,697
Come.

1182
01:41:20,992 --> 01:41:22,698
Okay. Come in.

1183
01:41:22,702 --> 01:41:24,693
Come in. You come with me.

1184
01:41:24,704 --> 01:41:27,491
So excited to show you all
the improvements we've made.

1185
01:41:38,301 --> 01:41:40,758
Jai! Guess who's here!

1186
01:41:44,890 --> 01:41:46,926
- Miss Isabel!
- Jail

1187
01:41:46,934 --> 01:41:48,765
oh, I missed you!

1188
01:41:48,769 --> 01:41:51,260
I missed you too.

1189
01:41:51,272 --> 01:41:52,603
Miss Isabel? “What?

1190
01:41:52,607 --> 01:41:54,188
Come. “What?

1191
01:41:54,191 --> 01:41:55,191
What is it?

1192
01:41:57,903 --> 01:42:00,394
I ook. A bird's nest.

1193
01:42:00,406 --> 01:42:02,021
Oh, amazing.

1194
01:42:02,033 --> 01:42:04,649
- I watched the mother feed them.
- Really?

1195
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:06,070

1196
01:42:06,078 --> 01:42:08,410

1197
01:42:08,831 --> 01:42:09,820
Vindaloo?

1198
01:42:09,832 --> 01:42:11,288
No, miss Isabel.

1199
01:42:11,292 --> 01:42:12,202
Worms.

1200
01:42:12,209 --> 01:42:13,790
Oh, worms.

1201
01:42:17,131 --> 01:42:18,541
Jal, I want to ask you something.

1202
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:26,216
How would you like to come
back with me to New York?

1203
01:42:30,102 --> 01:42:31,102
To live.

1204
01:42:34,565 --> 01:42:35,805
No.

1205
01:42:40,696 --> 01:42:42,687
I will miss my friends.

1206
01:42:43,699 --> 01:42:46,281
The thing is, is that I have to live there.

1207
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:50,578
So then we wouldn't be able
to see each other as much.

1208
01:42:53,417 --> 01:42:55,624
You can come and visit.

1209
01:42:57,171 --> 01:42:58,206
Yeah, I can.

1210
01:43:03,844 --> 01:43:04,879
Jal, come!

1211
01:43:07,014 --> 01:43:08,014
Come on, jal!

1212
01:43:08,974 --> 01:43:10,464
You want to go play?

1213
01:43:10,476 --> 01:43:11,841
Go on. Go.
