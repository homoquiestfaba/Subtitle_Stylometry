1
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:17,981
THE SILENCE OF NETO

2
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,687
You're absolutely right, Al.
Thank you.

3
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:34,564
Welcome, baseball fans.
Buck Cañiel here live.

4
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:38,536
This is the moment
of truth for the Indians.

5
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:42,196
who are trailing
3 games to nil...

6
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:14,493
Your uncle was
in terrible pain, Neto.

7
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:18,334
Now he's at peace.

8
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:00,743
Your papers.

9
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,604
Choy, it's me!

10
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:06,674
Your Honour, I'm sorry.
I didn't recognize you.

11
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,616
So you made lieutenant?

12
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,948
My brother just died.

13
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,224
Don Ernesto?

14
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,897
Show this to anyone
who stops you.

15
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,410
Thanks, you're very kind.

16
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,340
My deepest sympathy.

17
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,140
- Señora, my condolences.
- Thank you.

18
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:52,292
Doña Mercedes,
my condolences.

19
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:59,167
I want to go with him.
My Ernesto!

20
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:02,670
Don't say that, it's a sin.

21
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,174
The sin is that
he never married me.

22
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:12,408
He promised to marry me once
his mother and father died.

23
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,611
And there she is,
fit as a fiddle.

24
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:17,653
What a scandal!

25
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,853
Give her a pill,
take her for a walk...

26
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:24,287
But for God's sake
get her out of here!

27
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:54,212
It's okay, Neto. Relax.

28
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,062
And the elder son
said to his father...

29
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,632
"I have long served you
and never disobeyed you.

30
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:46,100
"Yet you never
gave me a calf.

31
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,204
"But when this son came,

32
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:51,534
"who has wasted your fortune
on loose women,

33
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,338
"you killed the fatted calf
for him."

34
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:58,977
And the father said to him,
"Son, you are always with me."

35
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:03,446
"But it was fitting that
we should feast and rejoice

36
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:07,887
"because your brother was dead
and has come back to life.

37
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:12,190
"He was lost
and now he is found."

38
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:43,262
Mother most Holy,
I am a sinner.

39
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,125
Forgive me.

40
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,398
Last night I forgot
to pray for my uncle.

41
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,503
Please don't send him to hell.

42
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:56,469
He was a little strange,
but I thought he was great.

43
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:01,536
Hail Mary, full of grace...

44
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:09,548
Hey, Uncle! Aren't you
supposed to be dead?

45
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,082
Don't be scared, Neto.

46
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,784
You're all dressed up.

47
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,452
How was your exam?

48
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,159
Don't worry.

49
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,759
I bet you flunked.

50
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:29,198
I'm just kidding.

51
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,865
Let me see...

52
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,771
You got 98.

53
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:43,113
Come on, let's go
and have a little talk.

54
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,728
This may be
your best trick yet.

55
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:06,575
You don't think I'd leave
without saying goodbye?

56
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,510
No way!

57
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,674
Is something bothering you?

58
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,450
Last night I forgot
to pray for you.

59
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:19,447
You had your mind
on Nidia, you rascal.

60
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,454
She sure is cute.

61
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:26,056
I had my eye on her myself.

62
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:29,530
But she wouldn't give me
a tumble. Lucky boy!

63
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,530
So you're just like
everyone else.

64
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,264
What did you expect?

65
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:39,277
- I thought you had no faults.
- Neto, always remember this.

66
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,743
The worst thing to do
is not to say what you feel.

67
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,974
Remember,
say what you feel.

68
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,448
Remember, say what you feel.
Remember...

69
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:53,152
<i>six months earlier...</i>

70
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:02,200
Oh, my God! My God!
What's happened?

71
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:05,902
What's the matter?
No, no...no!

72
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:09,837
He's dead! He's dead!

73
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,736
Hi, Mum, we're home.

74
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:15,345
Hello, darling.
Did you get wet?

75
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:18,540
No, the rain was over
when we left school.

76
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,083
But there were
some great puddles.

77
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,415
Mario! You're all wet!
And you too.

78
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:27,057
Hi, kids.
How was school?

79
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,454
Okay, go and get changed.
Go on.

80
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,032
Children, here's your snack.

81
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:16,935
Elena...

82
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,740
Wow! It looks great.

83
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,971
- You like it?
- I love it.

84
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:25,183
There are
some great bargains...

85
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:40,494
I will return, María Elena,
when there is peace.

86
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:46,427
When justice is done...
and our mission is ended.

87
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:53,236
I will return, María Elena.
One day I will return.

88
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,505
When there is peace...

89
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:59,813
The Unforgettable
Adventures of...

90
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,684
...a special bulletin.

91
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:09,725
The President of the Republic,
Col. Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán,

92
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:12,896
announced this afternoon
that, as of today,

93
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:16,566
the government of
the United States of America

94
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:19,862
has established
a naval blockade...

95
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,397
Who knows
what will happen?

96
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,003
Don't worry.

97
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,537
...to prevent
the entry of arms...

98
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:30,680
Now we'll never know what
happened to the Villalobos.

99
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,545
I know. They shouldn't
be allowed to interrupt.

100
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,223
Hey, try holding your breath
underwater for a whole minute.

101
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,926
- How will that help?
- It will strengthen your lungs.

102
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:49,098
Neto, enough talking
on the phone.

103
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:52,464
Bulletin terminated.
Over and out.

104
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,640
I don't like
talking on the phone.

105
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:02,004
- Neither do l, Cristy.
- It's not like before, is it?

106
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,842
People used to talk
to each other, face to face.

107
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,378
Guess what I'll do when
I grow up and have money.

108
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:15,154
Take care of your parents?

109
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,852
Will you... travel?

110
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:25,097
I'll get a phone in my car
and call the whole world.

111
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,229
What an imagination, Neto.

112
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,872
Hello, Uncle Ernesto?
Hello?

113
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,072
For Mother's medicine.

114
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,305
You might need it.

115
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,911
La Hora! La Hora!
Extra! Extra!

116
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:47,583
Be careful what you say.

117
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,819
These days you never know
who you might be talking to.

118
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:56,194
Hi, Chilo. What's news?

119
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:00,268
I saw Rodrigo demonstrating
at the National Palace.

120
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,331
Put the change
in your piggy bank.

121
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,737
Good afternoon,
Don Eduardo.

122
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,382
Hello, dear.

123
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,145
Hello, Father.

124
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:21,392
Hi. Did you do
your homework?

125
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,362
Yes, but I have to study
some more.

126
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,058
Did something
go wrong at work?

127
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,168
Things are turning ugly.

128
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,431
You must tell Rodrigo
to keep out of politics.

129
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,145
- It could make trouble for us.
- I'll talk to Rosa.

130
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,814
And if Nidia wants
to see her dad

131
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,312
Sunday is her day off.

132
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,814
Okay, I'll tell her.

133
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:33,494
What are you doing, child?

134
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,193
Neto, what are you doing?

135
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,925
My exercises.

136
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,970
Exercises?
Are you crazy?

137
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:49,112
With this report on
our country's impending crisis

138
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:53,182
we sign off this broadcast
of Guatemala Flash.

139
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,234
Just rumors.

140
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,040
Today when the rain started

141
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,979
I was thinking of
our first quarrel. Remember?

142
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:32,049
You arrived in Chichicastenango
completely soaked.

143
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,953
And I told my mother I never
wanted to see you again.

144
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,527
My dear...

145
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,630
How silly I was.

146
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:33,418
Food. Compass.
Gloves. Water.

147
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:53,432
Rodrigo, please, I'm working.

148
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,308
Teach me to iron?

149
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:05,108
No, please... I'm busy.

150
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,809
Come on...

151
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,451
Drop that a minute.

152
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,993
Why play hard to get?

153
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,524
The iron!

154
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:57,130
It's burnt and I'll get fired.

155
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:02,239
Now what do I do?
What am I going to do?

156
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,399
Nine.

157
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:08,805
Ten.

158
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:13,177
Eleven.

159
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:17,882
Thirteen.

160
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,622
Tomorrow I must do twenty.

161
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:32,403
- Hurry up, Neto.
- Coming.

162
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,843
Careful.

163
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:58,893
Fighting for Peace and Honor.
The Three Villalobos.

164
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,861
I, Rodolfo... Macho... Miguelón...

165
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,625
solemnly swear
we will not rest

166
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:07,804
until the death of our brother
is avenged.

167
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,066
I swear.

168
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:39,101
Girls, out of the pool.

169
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,767
You too, boys.

170
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,719
Antigua by 5 am...

171
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,651
Santa María by 6.

172
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:05,487
Then we set off up the volcano,
and keep heading south.

173
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,740
Wherever there's suffering.

174
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,815
- Wherever there's misery.
- Wherever evil prevails.

175
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:31,078
Wherever danger threatens.

176
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:34,349
Tamacún the Avenger
will ride again.

177
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:57,676
All set, Rodrigo?

178
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,980
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

179
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,447
I have to stand guard outside.

180
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,447
Did Neto explain?

181
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:08,283
Sort of.

182
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,985
Here's how it works.

183
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:15,591
For 5 cents
you can see two pages.

184
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:19,761
10 cents
gets you five pages.

185
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,570
And for 25 cents...

186
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:25,801
the whole magazine.

187
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:28,610
You pay up front.

188
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:49,059
Slow down, Rodrigo.

189
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:08,751
There once lived a king
who had a palace of diamonds,

190
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:13,115
a balcony of malachite,
a great coat of cloth

191
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:17,486
and a kind and beautiful
daughter, Princess Margarita.

192
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,663
As beautiful as you.

193
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:36,311
All done?

194
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:40,176
Here... I brought
the knapsack you asked for.

195
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,751
- Take good care of it.
- Thanks.

196
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,454
I sure will.

197
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,728
What about my commission?

198
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,361
Ten percent.

199
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:03,431
- Can we go?
- Hold on.

200
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:05,707
Again?

201
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,744
See how your parents
gave you permission to go?

202
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:14,349
That's because the whole
was going to be at the pool.

203
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:18,014
Talking about permissions,
look at this.

204
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,456
Let's see.

205
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:31,901
It's the same permission slip
as for the swimming trip.

206
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:36,070
No. The 18th is...

207
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,832
In 10 days.

208
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:42,011
Exactly. The date of our plan.
I just wrote in the new date.

209
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:46,979
During recess
when no one was watching.

210
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:51,147
I used the teacher's typewriter
for the new dates.

211
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,056
Okay, let's go.

212
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:13,067
The class has already started.

213
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:38,262
I like Ruth.
What about you?

214
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,971
Me, Maria.
How about you, Neto?

215
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:45,273
- I know who.
- Me too.

216
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,206
- Ani.
- You're hooked on her...

217
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:03,183
Ani, what's going on here?

218
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:07,056
- It was an alley cat.
- Oh, those awful cats!

219
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,300
Back to work, girls.

220
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,124
Why were you at ballet class?

221
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,560
I wanted... to see you.

222
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:48,495
And... I wanted
to ask you something.

223
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:50,101
What?

224
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,173
If I could...

225
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:56,644
If I could walk you home.

226
00:26:58,016 --> 00:26:59,984
What do you think of the clouds?

227
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:02,242
I like clouds.

228
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,683
Okay.

229
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:06,185
Really?

230
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,629
Look at that one.

231
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:20,871
It looks like a goldfish
chatting with a wild boar.

232
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,505
What an imagination.

233
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:29,246
Just one more bite.
A little more. The last one.

234
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:33,115
No sweeter sight
than a sweet with a sweet.

235
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,639
- Hello, Don Choy.
- No, wait, Neto.

236
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,639
Your father's busy.

237
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:03,507
Your money's not welcome.
Choy!

238
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,750
Show these men out.

239
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:10,078
That won't be necessary.
Government jobs aren't forever.

240
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,351
But money is.

241
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:14,352
Let's go.

242
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:30,638
One more taste.

243
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,867
I don't want any more,
Ernesto.

244
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:38,342
- If only I were a slice of cake.
- Don't say such things.

245
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,278
Mommy!

246
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:44,382
Delicious...

247
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:49,158
You know who's upstairs
watching?

248
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:50,951
Eduardo.

249
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:02,134
Attention,
Guatemalan National Army.

250
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:04,398
Here is important news

251
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:08,110
via Liberation Radio,
the underground station.

252
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:12,009
This is an outrage.
An organized circus.

253
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:14,615
Catholics of Guatemala,

254
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,979
Communism denies
the existence of God

255
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:23,192
to destroy the religious faith
that keeps us strong.

256
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,120
We must fight Communism!

257
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:33,227
- Dad, will you eat this?
- No, thanks.

258
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:48,783
Neto, is the glue ready yet?

259
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,817
Yes, coming.

260
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,560
Who invented balloons,
Uncle?

261
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,992
It was the Chinese.

262
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:07,932
They passed the idea
on to the Arabs

263
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:11,199
who gave it to the Spanish
and so to us.

264
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:14,273
The lndians got everything
from the Spanish.

265
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:17,743
No! The Maya
were great inventors.

266
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:22,281
They had a way of counting
like our decimal system

267
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,248
to write big numbers
in small spaces.

268
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,152
- Did they have telescopes?
- Of course.

269
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:32,193
They simply used
two sticks to see...

270
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,454
the moon...

271
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:38,634
Venus...

272
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:42,873
the stars.

273
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,574
And what about Tikal?

274
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,371
The Maya
were great architects.

275
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:53,914
- Better than the Romans?
- Just as good.

276
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,153
Did Rome have lots
of Romans?

277
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:59,389
Yes. Big Romans,
little Romans...

278
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:02,353
- Lady Romans.
- What else have you seen?

279
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,595
Many things.
Strange animals, dinosaurs...

280
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,594
pink elephants,
five-legged hippos...

281
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,267
What color were they,
my son?

282
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:16,568
All beautiful colors, Mama.

283
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:19,501
They were green...

284
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:23,175
red... bright yellow...

285
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:24,676
fuschia!

286
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:27,315
But most amazing of all

287
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:31,452
was the time I saw
the Pope in person.

288
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,247
Pius XII?

289
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:38,723
Pius XII... in the flesh.

290
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,897
Did he pardon your sins?

291
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,123
Elena, please.

292
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:48,371
What sins could my son have
that couldn't be forgiven?

293
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,902
True.

294
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:53,575
All that's left
is to canonize him.

295
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:55,839
Hi, Eduardo.

296
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:00,650
So you're back
unannounced as usual.

297
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,683
Did you enjoy the pastries?

298
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:07,253
Hi, Dad.

299
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:11,959
The kids are about to fly
this balloon. Why not come?

300
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,164
You too, Mother.

301
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:18,094
No, it's dangerous.
Boys shouldn't play with fire.

302
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:20,303
They're irresponsible.

303
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:23,365
Because parents
make them that way.

304
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:27,242
Besides, it's late, Elena.

305
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,781
Okay, kids,
say good night.

306
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,048
It's time for you
to lie down, too.

307
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:39,688
Bye, son.

308
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,736
Don't speak to me that way
in front of the children.

309
00:32:57,008 --> 00:33:01,342
And don't tell me how to bring
them up. I'm a good father.

310
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:04,240
- What are you insinuating?
- Nothing.

311
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:07,245
Who knows how many
children you have?

312
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,316
What's my life to you?

313
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:11,987
What matters
is your bad example.

314
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:16,727
Is it bad to tell them
there's a whole world outside?

315
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:21,254
At least they won't turn out
to be wandering misfits.

316
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,564
And you want them
to be robots like yourself.

317
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,362
Let them breathe a little.

318
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:32,268
Their place is here at home
with their parents.

319
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:34,443
You're just like Mum and Dad.

320
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:37,909
You selfishly think
children are only meant

321
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,275
to look after their parents.

322
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:43,611
You're the selfish one,
bumming around the world,

323
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,085
pretending
no one understands you.

324
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:48,285
Cut the crap.

325
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:53,155
You know very well I left
to earn money to send home.

326
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:55,399
Those damned money orders...

327
00:33:55,633 --> 00:34:00,070
Mum would hide them from Dad
so he couldn't tear them up.

328
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:01,931
And he'd shout...

329
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,869
"I'd trade a million checks
for one hug from my son."

330
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,236
Hypocrite!

331
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:10,345
As usual.

332
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,945
You can't face the truth.

333
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:17,148
I'm leaving before
I punch you in the mouth.

334
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:52,479
No, Neto, no!

335
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,392
No, Neto, no!

336
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:02,690
I told you not to do that.

337
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:10,607
While you live in my house
you'll do as I say.

338
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:15,036
- That's dangerous.
- No, Daddy!

339
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:22,710
Silence!

340
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:28,688
Silence now.
That's it. Shut up!

341
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:37,864
No, I didn't mean it.
It was an accident.

342
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:40,229
No, Daddy!

343
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,633
What beautiful gondolas,
Uncle.

344
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:49,970
The postcard reminded me of
the boats on Lake Amatitlán.

345
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:53,114
But the gondoliers here
don 't dress as well

346
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,216
as they do in Venice.

347
00:35:56,053 --> 00:36:01,116
I've been preparing for a while
for a big adventure.

348
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:06,426
I'll tell you about it when
you return for my birthday.

349
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,163
That's all for now.

350
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:13,129
I remain your ever loyal
and attentive servant,

351
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:16,962
Ernesto Antonio
Yepes Amézquita.

352
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:09,449
Mom, Cristy's asking
for the punch.

353
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,659
Coming.

354
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:16,999
Rodrigo!

355
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,704
Tonight you won't get away.

356
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:23,406
I told you
to leave Nidia alone.

357
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:25,164
It's nothing, Mom.

358
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:28,569
Think of your future.
Don't be a fool.

359
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,655
Here are the drinks.

360
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:45,990
There's a special bottle
just for you.

361
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:09,712
A drink, Justo?

362
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:15,984
Ice?

363
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:28,895
Let's hope for the best.

364
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:37,506
The children
are what worry me most.

365
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:01,193
Uncle!

366
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:05,936
I didn't know you were back.

367
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:08,369
Twelve already.

368
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:10,739
Yep, I'm getting old.

369
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:13,449
And so much yet to see.

370
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:26,223
Don't turn your back
on life's surprises.

371
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,624
- Then you won't be bored.
- Let's get some cake.

372
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:33,700
You can have mine.
There's a gift inside for you.

373
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:35,166
Okay, Uncle.

374
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:49,278
Neto, come on.

375
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,988
- Did you find the top?
- Yes.

376
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:55,122
Come on. The ants
will get you out here.

377
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:58,958
Cristy, the cake looks terrific.
Eduardo...

378
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,890
A candle went out.
Cristy, call the children.

379
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:06,101
Kids, come and blow out
the candles.

380
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:10,034
One.. two... three.

381
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:27,347
Dad, what's that?

382
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:30,690
It's for his asthma.

383
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:54,507
This cake stinks
but it tastes good. Smell it.

384
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:27,008
What a lovely party.

385
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,045
It really is such fun.

386
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:05,950
My goodness, Neto!
You musn't get so excited.

387
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,648
- You could have an attack.
- Listen to your mother.

388
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:18,494
If you're not careful, you won't
be able to breathe tonight.

389
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:22,535
- But I feel fine.
- Maybe for now.

390
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:35,510
Look.

391
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:37,845
Your uncle sent you this.

392
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:47,724
Look, that's Babe Ruth
the day he retired.

393
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:54,935
New York, 1 May 1954.

394
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:58,470
Dear Neto, it's time to fly
your first balloon.

395
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:02,542
I made this one especially
for you. Happy Birthday.

396
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:06,079
With all my love,
your Uncle Ernesto.

397
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:24,194
I'm going to fly this myself.

398
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,968
Dad, can I fly my balloon?

399
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:31,003
Neto, this is
a dangerous business.

400
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:32,573
But Dad...

401
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,938
Watch and you can do it
when you're old enough.

402
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,306
Make room.
I'm going to fill it with air.

403
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:45,316
Rodrigo, give me a hand.

404
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,959
Watch, this is how it's done.

405
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:53,855
Neto...

406
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:57,491
What are you doing?
You'll catch your death.

407
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:01,058
Look, Mom.
Here comes a comet.

408
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:05,368
Oh Neto...
Comets don't come, they go.

409
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:08,730
Always running away,
like your Uncle Ernesto.

410
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:16,002
Come, let's go inside,
my little monkey.

411
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:28,224
He only invited Ani
to his party.

412
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:30,324
A party just for geniuses.

413
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:33,018
For geniuses
and revolutionaries.

414
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:37,199
Geniuses are dopey
and revolutionaries are dumb.

415
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:39,334
My dad's not a revolutionary.

416
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:42,027
My dad says
that revolutionaries...

417
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:43,967
wear red underwear!

418
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:48,133
- Leave him alone!
- You stay out of it.

419
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:53,145
- Want to see something good?
- Like what?

420
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:59,246
Children, stop it.
Everyone inside, now!

421
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:02,349
Are you all right, Neto?

422
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:05,789
Today we learn the meaning
of the words "tolerance"

423
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:07,486
and "dignity".

424
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:11,098
Any volunteers to read
from the blackboard?

425
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:15,598
Neto, please.

426
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:20,610
"There is no human power

427
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:27,242
"capable of crushing
the will of a people

428
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:30,716
"unless its leaders
betray them.

429
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:34,822
"People and government
together constitute dignity."

430
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:38,026
Juan José Arévalo,
President of Guatemala,

431
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:42,288
1946 - 1951.

432
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:57,070
Looks like it's getting cloudy.

433
00:46:57,347 --> 00:47:00,680
Cloudy? You're crazy.
There are no clouds.

434
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:05,655
Look what they're doing.
Let's get them!

435
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,589
They're throwing down papers!

436
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:22,895
"For God, Country and Liberty.
Fight Communism."

437
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:54,370
Alberto, Neto...
a demonstration!

438
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:56,266
Wow! Hop on, Neto.

439
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:05,707
Close the door
before they get here.

440
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:35,534
My love, we must
defend democracy.

441
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:40,944
Unite!
Unite and fight!

442
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:18,180
There's no danger,
my darling.

443
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,614
I'm scared, Rodrigo.

444
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,151
Oh, my love!

445
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:28,587
I'll be back soon.

446
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:35,431
I hope you die in the war,
Rodrigo, and never come back.

447
00:49:35,939 --> 00:49:38,908
Rodrigo... no.

448
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:41,570
I have to go.

449
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:52,218
Whore!

450
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:57,183
I'm going to tell Dad you're
messing around with Rodrigo.

451
00:49:57,461 --> 00:50:00,897
Child, it's just something
grown people do.

452
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:05,567
Then, when I'm grown up,
will you mess around with me?

453
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:10,072
Dirty Indian.

454
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:15,110
Neto, in this country
everyone is an Indian.

455
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:17,177
Not me.

456
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:26,249
Explain to me
what makes balloons fly.

457
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:28,514
It's very simple.

458
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:32,193
First of all, balloons were
invented by the Chinese...

459
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,896
My dear Ani,
I'm writing you this letter

460
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,929
in case something
on my arduous journey

461
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:40,998
prevents me returning.

462
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:44,068
I would like these verses
to carry to you

463
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:48,139
my last breath
and eternal devotion.

464
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:53,442
"Little princess, how beautiful
is the sea, and the wind

465
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:57,208
"carrying me the scent of
orange blossom, your breath."

466
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:02,514
"Now that you are so far away,
keep a sweet thought of me,

467
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:06,388
"as sweet as the story
I wanted to tell you."

468
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,999
You explain things very well.

469
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,669
Quick, it's getting late.

470
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:16,338
...with much love, Neto.

471
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:23,008
Ani...
Can I ask you a favor?

472
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,474
Of course.

473
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:30,881
Keep this letter.

474
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:35,184
If I'm not at school on Monday,
read it and think of me.

475
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:36,756
Why?

476
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,853
Good afternoon, Tomás.

477
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:42,364
I'll come inside in a moment.

478
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,694
Why?

479
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:48,267
Because I have to go
on a very important journey.

480
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,262
Where to?

481
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:52,634
I'll tell you when I get back.

482
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,247
Hurry up, child.

483
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:07,450
Thank you.
You're much prettier in person.

484
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:28,211
Isn't he sweet?

485
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:49,355
Stop pestering me.

486
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:53,191
He's going on a camping trip
with a fake permission slip.

487
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,631
Here, take this and get out.

488
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:06,214
- I am immortal, silly giant.
- I am invincible, sad knight.

489
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:11,083
And now I will destroy you
with my evil tortures,

490
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:13,822
you stupid,
black-bearded fool!

491
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:26,500
- Raise you five.
- A pair of sixes.

492
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:29,102
- Two pairs.
- You've won again...

493
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:31,864
TGW, the Voice of Guatemala,

494
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:36,441
via the Emergency
Broadcast System,

495
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:40,141
brings you
this special bulletin.

496
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:43,385
The Government
of the Republic...

497
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:50,150
...this afternoon at 4 p.m.
two pirate aircraft,

498
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:55,863
in flagrant violation of
our national sovereignty...

499
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:59,529
Thank you, Lord.

500
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:05,806
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

501
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:09,739
Blessed art thou
among women.

502
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:13,944
Thank you,
Lord of Esquipulas.

503
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:22,420
We thank Thee for watching
over us in our time of need.

504
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:36,996
Mother dearest...

505
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:40,266
I'm so glad you're back, son.

506
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:43,273
How are you, Ernesto?
What a surprise.

507
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,511
Look how beautiful you are.

508
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:54,657
When did you get back
to Guatemala?

509
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:58,121
I just got here.
It was too hot in Morocco

510
00:54:58,361 --> 00:55:00,795
so I've returned
to the Cold War.

511
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:03,795
Now pour me a drink.
I'm chilly already.

512
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:07,797
You're so silly, Ernesto.
You never change.

513
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:11,073
The Lord heard my prayer.

514
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,708
And now He'll send
the Americans

515
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,445
to free us
from the Communists.

516
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:20,740
Mama, you think anyone
who's different is a Communist.

517
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:22,882
Ernesto, respect your mother.

518
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:27,680
Tell Ambassador Peurifoy
to show us some respect.

519
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,186
Boys, don't argue, please.

520
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:31,494
Uncle!

521
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:34,288
How are you, young man?

522
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:38,596
No one believes I saw
the Communist planes.

523
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:42,166
It's really nothing
but American propaganda.

524
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:44,906
It's all so simple, right?

525
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:52,106
And to think, all of this
just to steal a few bananas.

526
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:56,642
But that's not why I came.
You can't stay here.

527
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:01,050
The National Guard will be
bombed, and you're too close.

528
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,121
He's right, Eduardo.

529
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:06,452
Where the hell are we
supposed to go, then?

530
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:11,063
To my house. Nobody would
think to bomb Antigua.

531
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:13,132
What about my field trip?

532
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:17,401
Forget about it.
Elena, get the bags ready.

533
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:23,645
I'm sure they'll postpone it.
Neto, let's go and pack.

534
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:25,744
Antigua will be fun.

535
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:30,550
- Do I bring my schoolbooks?
- There's no school tomorrow.

536
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:35,314
Quiet, kids!
This isn't a circus, it's a war.

537
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:41,258
You needn't upset them.
What do they know about war?

538
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:51,439
Hello.
Is Alberto there, please?

539
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:56,778
- Machito-Alberto?
- I read you, Neto-Rodolfo.

540
00:56:57,046 --> 00:57:01,278
The sardines' trip is postponed
until the shark is gone.

541
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,548
- Got it?
- Loud and clear.

542
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:06,050
- Tell Miguelón.
- Over.

543
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:08,153
Over and out.

544
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:14,853
The just decision to expropriate
uncultivated land

545
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:17,895
for distribution
among landless peasants

546
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:22,933
has made local reactionaries
and rich foreigners desperate

547
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:27,608
and intensified
a long-standing conspiracy,

548
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:34,146
national and international,
powerful and antidemocratic,

549
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:39,150
whose intentions
are to damage

550
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:43,017
the democratic government
of Guatemala

551
00:57:43,326 --> 00:57:47,490
and to block
its program of reform

552
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:50,789
which, as everybody knows,

553
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:54,764
seeks to develop
the economy of our country.

554
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:05,337
Here, take these.

555
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:08,444
This one's fixed.

556
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:10,482
People of Guatemala...

557
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:15,519
The Communists' land reform
is causing widespread misery.

558
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:18,453
The government
has cheated you.

559
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:20,856
We must fight Communism!

560
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:42,476
Eeny, meeny, miney, mo...

561
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,220
Okay, I'll teach you one.

562
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:50,622
By Lake Titicaca,
a lady had to caca.

563
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:53,487
She had no hankie,
had to use her pinkie

564
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:55,559
and the pinkie is you!

565
00:59:26,629 --> 00:59:31,123
Liberation Radio of Guatemala,
the underground station...

566
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:38,065
...The Army's honour
is vested in the upholding

567
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:43,575
of the broadest democracy
and national independence.

568
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,940
- Okay here?
- Yes, fine.

569
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:51,618
... with absolute faith
and hope in the future...

570
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,356
People of Guatemala!

571
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:01,290
The government
has denied your rights

572
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:04,965
by turning labor codes
into an instrument of Moscow

573
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:07,635
and its Guatemalan puppets.

574
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:09,701
Down with the gover...

575
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:13,508
How terrible!

576
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:17,576
For their part,
the banana magnates,

577
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:21,873
sending their peasants
like lambs to the slaughter...

578
01:00:22,151 --> 01:00:25,450
How do you like that?
That Arbenz really has balls.

579
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:30,991
Shouldn't they have left
the banana company alone?

580
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:33,855
If it were only
about bananas...

581
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:38,497
What the gringos can't stand
is that we don't lick their boots.

582
01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:46,668
At least we'll have
the satisfaction

583
01:00:46,943 --> 01:00:51,903
of being the first to say no
to the Yankees.

584
01:00:53,249 --> 01:00:55,080
Yes, my friend.

585
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,219
First we water over here.

586
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:03,281
Like this.

587
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:07,019
And a little above.

588
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:11,556
And if you need more water...

589
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:32,181
What country are we in,
Agripina?

590
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:37,255
With your permission,
good night.

591
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:44,667
As your friend and brother...

592
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:51,072
I shall take your wallet
so that nobody can steal it.

593
01:01:52,975 --> 01:01:55,603
Look at the dog, Neto.

594
01:01:55,845 --> 01:01:57,904
He looks like our dog.

595
01:02:07,924 --> 01:02:09,687
Thank you very much.

596
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,491
You are very kind.

597
01:02:12,762 --> 01:02:15,287
And they said
there was a drought.

598
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:23,305
Hey, what's going on here?

599
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:26,234
Hey! What's the story?

600
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:28,774
My pants are all wet.

601
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:45,957
I'm getting tired, Uncle.
I feel my asthma coming on.

602
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:49,591
You and your asthma.

603
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:52,066
What can I do, Uncle?

604
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:57,396
I've taken all kinds of pills.
My bum is swollen from shots.

605
01:02:58,174 --> 01:03:00,335
And I still can't breathe.

606
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:04,672
Between your grandmother,
your mother, your aunt,

607
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:06,947
Rosa and Nidia,

608
01:03:07,183 --> 01:03:10,550
you've got five umbilical
cords feeding you

609
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,813
so you can't breathe
out of your own nose.

610
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:23,823
Neto, you're all wet.
Go inside and change.

611
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:27,568
Nidia, help Neto find
some dry clothes, please.

612
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:31,470
He isn't made of sugar.
He's a boy.

613
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:41,582
Mario, what are you doing?

614
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:49,748
Boys will be boys.

615
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:31,223
People of Guatemala...

616
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:36,303
Our country is undergoing
a very difficult test.

617
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:41,566
Two weeks ago
a cruel war was unleashed

618
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:46,941
and no government
appears to be responsible.

619
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:50,913
But we do know who has
committed this aggression

620
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:53,087
against our dear country.

621
01:04:53,356 --> 01:04:55,415
Elena, Arbenz is speaking.

622
01:04:55,691 --> 01:04:58,455
Everybody come!
It's the President.

623
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:02,721
...monopolies, in collaboration
with the U.S. government,

624
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:06,731
are responsible for
what has happened to us.

625
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:12,532
Pilots and mercenaries
of various countries,

626
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:16,939
hired by Guatemalan
exiles abroad

627
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:19,876
have unleashed fire
and death

628
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:23,483
with no regard
for innocent lives

629
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:26,017
or our country's integrity.

630
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:31,215
In whose name have they
committed these atrocities?

631
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:33,621
Under what flag?

632
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:36,696
We all know full well.

633
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:40,967
They have used the pretext
of Communism.

634
01:05:41,203 --> 01:05:43,433
The truth is very different.

635
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:46,642
Look for it
in the financial interests

636
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:48,867
of the United Fruit Company

637
01:05:49,178 --> 01:05:52,204
and the other
North American monopolies

638
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:55,779
with vast interests
in Latin America,

639
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:59,044
whose greatest fear
is that Guatemala's example

640
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:02,449
will spread to the rest
of Latin America.

641
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:07,728
After careful consideration and
with revolutionary conscience,

642
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,364
I have reached a decision

643
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:13,502
with enormous implications
for our country.

644
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:16,331
In the hope of halting
the aggression

645
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:19,234
and bringing peace back
to Guatemala,

646
01:06:19,508 --> 01:06:22,102
I have decided
to resign from power

647
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:27,075
and to place my command
in the hands of my friend

648
01:06:27,383 --> 01:06:31,217
Colonel Carlos Enrique Díaz
head of the Armed Forces...

649
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,447
So what happens now, Dad?

650
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:39,320
They give us back the land
the Communist took away.

651
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:42,324
Oh, yes.

652
01:06:42,598 --> 01:06:45,999
Those vast idle lands where
imaginary cows will graze

653
01:06:46,202 --> 01:06:49,035
and where we'll plant
invisible corn.

654
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:52,797
Thank you,
Our Lord of Esquipulas.

655
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:01,811
Tens years of struggle,
tears and sacrifice,

656
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:04,485
and of achievements
for democracy,

657
01:07:04,754 --> 01:07:08,656
stand in defiance
of the course of events.

658
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:12,360
Perhaps some will
feel I am making a mistake.

659
01:07:12,628 --> 01:07:16,120
In the depths of my conscience
I believe this is not true.

660
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:20,893
History alone
will be the final judge.

661
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:24,037
With the satisfaction
of one who believes

662
01:07:24,306 --> 01:07:27,639
he has done as he must,
and with faith in the future,

663
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:31,175
I say "Long live
the October Revolution!"

664
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:33,408
"Long live Guatemala!"

665
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:50,262
Where will you go, Uncle?

666
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:59,140
I don't know. To hell.
Maybe to Italy.

667
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:03,538
I'm ashamed to stay here,
among cowards and traitors.

668
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:05,737
Father's not a coward.

669
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:10,380
I didn't mean him.
With him it's another story.

670
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:13,678
Every time you two talk
you end up fighting.

671
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,221
Couldn't you just keep quiet?

672
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:19,961
That would be easiest,
wouldn't it, Neto?

673
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:23,563
But if you have something
to say, you must say it.

674
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:34,435
How like your mother you are.

675
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:39,871
You're quiet, just like her...
just like this whole country.

676
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:43,951
Neto, silence like this
isn't good.

677
01:08:44,253 --> 01:08:47,552
It's ingrained in us
from the time we're born.

678
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:51,554
But it's up to us to tear it out
from inside ourselves.

679
01:08:52,995 --> 01:08:55,964
Not until then
will we be able to breathe.

680
01:09:01,537 --> 01:09:03,402
Goodbye, Uncle.

681
01:09:04,006 --> 01:09:08,500
Take good care of yourself.
Take care, son.

682
01:09:32,034 --> 01:09:35,060
- Where's Ani?
- Isn't she here yet?

683
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:39,197
She always comes early.

684
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:43,768
President Jacobo Arbenz
has resigned.

685
01:09:44,113 --> 01:09:48,880
This affirms the strength
of the Liberation Army

686
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:54,521
which defeated him
overwhelmingly.

687
01:09:55,658 --> 01:09:58,650
It is with great joy
that we announce

688
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:03,090
that this crucial objective
has been achieved...

689
01:10:04,466 --> 01:10:06,457
I'll take care of it.

690
01:10:07,736 --> 01:10:09,533
What are you doing
at my desk?

691
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:12,302
My desk.

692
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:22,379
Your belongings
are in that box.

693
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:24,653
That's my fountain pen.

694
01:10:25,254 --> 01:10:28,985
Sorry, it's already been
registered in the inventory.

695
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:34,520
Need any help?

696
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:37,526
No, thank you.
I can manage on my own.

697
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:40,231
Well, hello there.

698
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:47,802
As of today...

699
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:52,405
Mr. Rogelio Pérez
will be your new teacher.

700
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:57,078
- They're in your hands now.
- Thank you, Principal.

701
01:11:06,395 --> 01:11:08,022
You may sit down.

702
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:32,618
Today we'll learn
the capitals of the states

703
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:36,187
of the United States
of America.

704
01:11:36,725 --> 01:11:38,716
Repeat after me.

705
01:11:40,562 --> 01:11:43,326
Alabama,
capital Montgomery.

706
01:11:46,935 --> 01:11:50,462
When I say repeat after me,
I mean everyone.

707
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:56,268
That's better.

708
01:11:59,848 --> 01:12:02,817
Arkansas,
capital Little Rock.

709
01:12:06,522 --> 01:12:08,456
Sir, I have to leave the room.

710
01:12:14,797 --> 01:12:16,321
Let's go on.

711
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:29,638
Neto, come back here!
I'll have to tell the Principal.

712
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:44,308
What are you doing?

713
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:47,317
- Looking for Ani.
- There's no Ani here.

714
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:55,091
Will you change the new
teacher's signature too?

715
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:56,558
Maybe.

716
01:13:56,865 --> 01:14:00,028
You can't do that.
It doesn't matter any more.

717
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,499
- This was your idea.
- So?

718
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:05,035
It doesn't matter any more.

719
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:09,139
You're on your own
with the volcano trip.

720
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:17,575
- Biscuit, Eduardo?
- Yes, thanks.

721
01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:22,018
Where are the maids?

722
01:14:22,391 --> 01:14:25,952
They're going crazy
looking for Rodrigo.

723
01:14:26,662 --> 01:14:28,323
What happened?

724
01:14:28,931 --> 01:14:32,298
He hasn't been home
in three days.

725
01:14:33,869 --> 01:14:35,097
Why not?

726
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:47,041
My parents are acting
as if they know nothing.

727
01:14:47,282 --> 01:14:49,011
Chickens!

728
01:14:52,754 --> 01:14:54,745
People of Guatemala...

729
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:58,648
In the tradition
of this great democracy...

730
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:00,519
What is it?

731
01:15:02,097 --> 01:15:04,031
Did you find out anything?

732
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:09,600
...on the occasion of the
greatest battle of our history.

733
01:15:10,072 --> 01:15:13,667
This will be Radio Liberation's
final broadcast.

734
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:19,046
"I hope you die in the war,
Rodrigo, and never come back. "

735
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:31,950
Germán!

736
01:16:32,788 --> 01:16:34,050
Al berto!

737
01:16:34,289 --> 01:16:35,950
Where are you?

738
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:43,932
Hey, look at this!

739
01:16:46,168 --> 01:16:47,999
You've got to see this!

740
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:56,503
No, Neto, leave it alone.
That's from the war.

741
01:16:58,180 --> 01:16:59,909
You sound like my dad.

742
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:02,978
Alberto's right.
It's dangerous.

743
01:17:03,218 --> 01:17:05,413
But it's so beautiful.

744
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:11,358
You jerk!

745
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:17,332
Germán...

746
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:20,931
Germán, what's the matter?

747
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:25,003
You stupid idiot!
You could have killed me.

748
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:29,270
Gosh,
I'm glad I didn't kill you.

749
01:17:56,905 --> 01:17:58,133
Hi, Dad.

750
01:18:00,475 --> 01:18:04,036
You seem worried.
What is it?

751
01:18:04,312 --> 01:18:05,973
It's nothing.

752
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:10,644
It must be something.
Is it about Neto?

753
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,148
Yes.

754
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:17,453
Lately he's become
so irresponsible.

755
01:18:17,659 --> 01:18:20,389
Your mother says
that's how boys are.

756
01:18:20,595 --> 01:18:22,529
But how would she know,
being a woman?

757
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:25,996
Yeah. He doesn't like
staying at home any more.

758
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:29,762
Right.
As if this were a prison.

759
01:18:30,806 --> 01:18:34,401
I love you, Dad.
And I like being here with you.

760
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:38,543
- Don't worry
- You're growing up, son.

761
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:44,215
Now that I have a new job
I'll be traveling more.

762
01:18:44,486 --> 01:18:48,013
I want to give you
the house's expense money.

763
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:51,387
Look after it. You know
how to handle money.

764
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:56,362
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

765
01:19:07,442 --> 01:19:09,103
Hurry up!

766
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:23,549
Let's go and play pool.

767
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,762
Not saying hello, Alejandra?

768
01:19:44,146 --> 01:19:47,240
Nice shot. Right, buddy?

769
01:19:49,484 --> 01:19:51,475
Don't choke.

770
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:55,121
- It wont be enough Mario.
- I gave you Q5.00 yesterday.

771
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:59,156
Yes, but I spent it. You ate
all the cookies yourself.

772
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:03,192
- Well, I was hungry.
- Give me one more Quetzal.

773
01:20:03,398 --> 01:20:05,730
No, it's too much.

774
01:20:06,001 --> 01:20:08,469
I'll give you 50 centavos.

775
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:10,900
This is getting out of hand.

776
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:15,041
- I'll have to see you father.
- So?

777
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:34,228
Respect your mother,
you bastard.

778
01:20:34,563 --> 01:20:37,999
- It's none of your business.
- Go and apologize.

779
01:20:39,901 --> 01:20:41,528
Apologize or you'll get it.

780
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:43,670
Ooh, I'm scared.

781
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:46,371
- Give me the money.
- It's mine!

782
01:20:46,608 --> 01:20:48,906
I should have it.
I'm older.

783
01:20:49,077 --> 01:20:52,046
I'm the one who should
take care of it.

784
01:21:02,724 --> 01:21:05,192
Boys! Stop fighting.

785
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:08,719
Neto, let go of your brother.

786
01:21:10,832 --> 01:21:13,130
- Let's go.
- But he started it...

787
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:16,735
- I don't want to hear.
- It's not my fault.

788
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:28,174
I gave Mum Q1.50.

789
01:21:36,825 --> 01:21:39,623
He's barely nine.
Why give him money?

790
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:41,625
It's disrespectful to me.

791
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:44,628
At least he knows
how to handle money.

792
01:21:44,866 --> 01:21:46,697
What do you mean by that?

793
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:49,700
You throw money away
on bingo and cards

794
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:52,339
and buying Neto
whatever he likes.

795
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:56,374
I play bingo because I'm bored,
understand? Fed up.

796
01:21:56,544 --> 01:21:59,138
All you care about
is your whisky.

797
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:01,747
I can't take it any more.

798
01:22:28,543 --> 01:22:32,445
Let me go, I haven't done
anything. I want to go home.

799
01:22:36,885 --> 01:22:38,546
Let's go, Doña Rosa.

800
01:22:38,753 --> 01:22:43,349
- That boy could be my son.
- But he's not. Let's go.

801
01:23:22,697 --> 01:23:24,597
Star, are you still in the sky?
Dove, have you flown away?

802
01:23:24,866 --> 01:23:28,768
Where are you?
You've been gone so long.

803
01:23:29,037 --> 01:23:32,939
You left like a sigh.
Is it forever?

804
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:56,193
Another small one.

805
01:24:06,074 --> 01:24:09,976
This came out great.
Congratulations.

806
01:24:10,178 --> 01:24:13,909
Even Mr. Pérez
won't be able to tell.

807
01:24:14,082 --> 01:24:16,175
Now I'll do yours.

808
01:24:19,754 --> 01:24:22,655
- Mum, sign this for me.
- I'm on the phone.

809
01:24:22,857 --> 01:24:25,792
It's just a permission slip
for school.

810
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:28,825
- For what?
- The class trip.

811
01:24:31,666 --> 01:24:32,894
Thanks.

812
01:26:19,707 --> 01:26:22,335
There's our volcano.
Let's go.

813
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:40,224
Leave, Nidia.

814
01:26:40,662 --> 01:26:43,927
Leave.
Don't end up like me.

815
01:26:44,132 --> 01:26:46,327
Go to your people.

816
01:26:48,736 --> 01:26:52,638
You'll be safe with them.
Don't stay here like I did.

817
01:26:53,942 --> 01:26:55,569
Leave, child.

818
01:26:57,946 --> 01:27:01,848
Eduardo,
a telegram from ltaly.

819
01:27:06,287 --> 01:27:09,950
"Ernesto Yepes recovering
from cardiac arrest.

820
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:12,149
"Valdevere Clinic.

821
01:27:12,393 --> 01:27:16,295
"Arriving Guatemala
October 19 via New York."

822
01:27:16,497 --> 01:27:18,556
That's tomorrow.

823
01:27:18,766 --> 01:27:21,826
Regard, Paola Corinne."

824
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:23,867
Who's Paola Corinne?

825
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:26,973
She must be
the director of the clinic.

826
01:27:27,842 --> 01:27:31,744
How awful.
Oh, that Ernesto.

827
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:33,710
If he doesn't take care

828
01:27:33,948 --> 01:27:36,610
One day he'll give us
a real scare.

829
01:27:37,185 --> 01:27:40,245
He needs to cut down
on drinking and smoking.

830
01:27:40,455 --> 01:27:41,888
So should you.

831
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:46,092
Don't worry. We Yepes
live to a ripe old age.

832
01:27:46,995 --> 01:27:48,860
We're quiet country folk.

833
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:50,827
What about Ernesto?

834
01:27:51,065 --> 01:27:53,329
I don't know
what happened there.

835
01:27:53,534 --> 01:27:56,094
He never liked
staying at home.

836
01:27:56,537 --> 01:27:59,028
A real vagabond.

837
01:28:00,008 --> 01:28:03,307
I've never heard you
speak of him without sarcasm.

838
01:28:03,544 --> 01:28:06,411
Elena, the man is ill.

839
01:28:07,515 --> 01:28:09,745
Don't be so self-centered.

840
01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:14,512
Maybe I am self-centered.

841
01:28:14,756 --> 01:28:18,089
But I'm tired of seeing you
so worried all the time.

842
01:28:18,293 --> 01:28:20,818
If I don't worry, who will?

843
01:28:21,629 --> 01:28:25,360
Everything seemed
so beautiful ten years ago.

844
01:28:26,034 --> 01:28:29,936
We couldn't even afford
a cradle when Neto was born.

845
01:28:31,372 --> 01:28:33,704
But we had our dreams.

846
01:28:33,941 --> 01:28:36,808
What happened
to those dreams?

847
01:28:53,027 --> 01:28:56,929
There once was a trio,
the Three Villalobos.

848
01:28:57,365 --> 01:29:01,267
Yes, there were three,
and none was a dodo.

849
01:29:02,103 --> 01:29:06,005
May the best luck,
God willing,

850
01:29:06,574 --> 01:29:10,237
always be there
to guide them

851
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:14,413
and we in Villahermosa

852
01:29:14,716 --> 01:29:18,618
will always sing this song.

853
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:23,122
There once was a trio
the Three Villalobos.

854
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:27,360
Yes, there were three
and none was a dodo...

855
01:30:10,872 --> 01:30:13,705
What's happening?
It won't fly.

856
01:30:14,108 --> 01:30:15,905
There is too much wind.

857
01:30:17,111 --> 01:30:18,373
It's burning.

858
01:30:18,713 --> 01:30:21,181
My balloon's burning.

859
01:30:21,449 --> 01:30:23,644
This thing doesn't work.

860
01:31:03,758 --> 01:31:07,660
- I'm staying here.
- The wolves will eat you.

861
01:31:08,362 --> 01:31:10,455
Let them.
I'm staying here.

862
01:31:10,698 --> 01:31:15,499
In that case,
I'm taking your pack.

863
01:31:15,570 --> 01:31:18,368
They'll have plenty to eat
with just you.

864
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:22,473
Dad was right. I shouldn't
start what I can't finish.

865
01:31:22,677 --> 01:31:23,871
So what do you want?

866
01:31:25,947 --> 01:31:28,814
- To get to the top.
- Come on, then.

867
01:33:54,662 --> 01:33:55,959
Cut it out.

868
01:34:00,801 --> 01:34:02,564
Thanks, Alberto.

869
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:34,629
Look who's there.

870
01:34:44,445 --> 01:34:47,846
You're going bad, Neto.
You're a forger.

871
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:52,247
What about my friends?

872
01:34:52,453 --> 01:34:54,250
They can come.

873
01:35:30,224 --> 01:35:32,886
Why did you come back?

874
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:35,060
Do you mind?

875
01:35:37,264 --> 01:35:40,062
No. Forgive me.

876
01:35:40,935 --> 01:35:44,837
I just thought
you'd stay in Rome.

877
01:35:46,974 --> 01:35:48,839
With Paola.

878
01:35:51,245 --> 01:35:54,180
I came home
to die in my own bed.

879
01:35:54,448 --> 01:35:57,906
So no one could
blame me for going off...

880
01:35:58,652 --> 01:36:01,246
and dying
God knows where,

881
01:36:01,589 --> 01:36:05,491
not even knowing
where I was buried.

882
01:36:07,661 --> 01:36:11,563
- Don't be so cynical.
- You want me to change now?

883
01:36:14,301 --> 01:36:16,201
Life's a big joke, isn't it?

884
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:17,664
Why?

885
01:36:18,873 --> 01:36:22,775
I kept running away from
this house to be different.

886
01:36:23,544 --> 01:36:25,910
But I never left it behind.

887
01:36:26,547 --> 01:36:29,277
and I'm ending up
like everyone else.

888
01:36:30,751 --> 01:36:32,651
What do you mean?

889
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:35,480
It's time for me to pay up.

890
01:36:35,756 --> 01:36:38,054
You never change, Ernesto.

891
01:36:40,261 --> 01:36:44,163
And what guides our life?
I don't even know.

892
01:36:44,765 --> 01:36:48,166
We're all different,
that's about all I know.

893
01:36:48,369 --> 01:36:50,360
Full of dreams...

894
01:36:50,771 --> 01:36:53,205
that we don't
even understand.

895
01:36:54,708 --> 01:36:56,005
Yes.

896
01:36:56,844 --> 01:36:59,278
We're all different.

897
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:05,819
Do you know
why I really came back?

898
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:09,653
Only in the place
where we were born

899
01:37:09,924 --> 01:37:11,824
can we come to life again.

900
01:37:13,327 --> 01:37:14,954
Anywhere else

901
01:37:15,196 --> 01:37:18,791
we would remain
incomplete forever

902
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:23,569
and our pain
would never end.

903
01:37:31,345 --> 01:37:33,370
Come in, Neto.

904
01:37:39,019 --> 01:37:41,647
Don't tire your uncle.

905
01:37:46,961 --> 01:37:49,259
Give me a hug, my boy.

906
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:55,798
What happened to you?

907
01:37:56,003 --> 01:37:59,097
Nothing.
I came to see you.

908
01:38:00,241 --> 01:38:03,972
So, you climbed
up to the crater?

909
01:38:04,445 --> 01:38:07,778
It was hard, but I made it.

910
01:38:08,582 --> 01:38:12,484
You look great. You did
something big by yourself.

911
01:38:13,787 --> 01:38:17,052
Yes. I never thought
I could do it.

912
01:38:17,258 --> 01:38:19,283
And I didn't get asthma.

913
01:38:21,962 --> 01:38:23,122
Water?

914
01:38:25,132 --> 01:38:28,260
I tried to fly a balloon,
but I couldn't.

915
01:38:28,669 --> 01:38:30,398
You know why?

916
01:38:31,338 --> 01:38:34,671
Because it wasn't a balloon
you made yourself.

917
01:38:37,645 --> 01:38:39,579
I have to go, Uncle.

918
01:38:39,813 --> 01:38:42,543
I have to study
for an exam tomorrow.

919
01:38:42,716 --> 01:38:44,081
That's fine.

920
01:38:44,852 --> 01:38:49,585
Before you leave,
open that trunk.

921
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:56,862
Those patterns and the
tissue paper are for you.

922
01:38:58,599 --> 01:39:02,501
You have to build
the first balloon you fly...

923
01:39:02,937 --> 01:39:04,598
yourself.

924
01:39:05,472 --> 01:39:09,238
Thanks, Uncle. You'll be there
to help me, right?

925
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:12,412
I'll be there, just in case.

926
01:39:13,213 --> 01:39:17,115
But it must be your balloon.

927
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:22,418
For Ernesto,
with all my love.

928
01:39:22,856 --> 01:39:26,053
I'll never forget you.
Elena.

929
01:39:38,672 --> 01:39:42,574
My uncle always said
it's not good to keep silent.

930
01:39:45,612 --> 01:39:48,080
Neto, they're going
to bring him out.

931
01:39:51,785 --> 01:39:53,719
- I have to go.
- Where?

932
01:39:54,788 --> 01:39:58,690
But this time
it was he who kept silent.

933
01:40:38,432 --> 01:40:39,797
Let's go.

934
01:40:57,184 --> 01:41:01,086
Nidia, come on.
Let's go fly my balloon.

935
01:41:53,574 --> 01:41:56,441
- I can't do it.
- Never say you can't.

936
01:41:56,710 --> 01:41:58,507
I have to go.

937
01:41:58,712 --> 01:42:01,875
Keep trying
until the flame catches.

938
01:42:02,116 --> 01:42:04,050
This is the last match.

939
01:42:04,218 --> 01:42:06,152
Don't worry.

940
01:42:41,622 --> 01:42:44,352
The dead remain
in the memory of the living.

941
01:42:44,758 --> 01:42:46,350
Is it filling?

942
01:42:47,427 --> 01:42:48,917
More or less.

943
01:43:02,276 --> 01:43:04,938
There. You see?

944
01:43:25,799 --> 01:43:27,858
Goodbye, Neto.

945
01:44:01,001 --> 01:44:03,162
Goodbye, Uncle.

946
01:44:06,773 --> 01:44:08,331
Goodbye, Neto.

947
01:44:08,642 --> 01:44:11,509
- Where are you going?
- Back to my village.

948
01:44:11,712 --> 01:44:13,043
Why?

949
01:44:13,313 --> 01:44:17,215
I want my baby to be
born among its own people.

950
01:44:23,023 --> 01:44:24,251
Nidia!

951
01:44:24,324 --> 01:44:26,815
Always let your son
say what he feels.

952
01:44:39,006 --> 01:44:42,908
It's like the one Ernesto flew
when his father died.

953
01:44:50,217 --> 01:44:54,119
The most important thing
my Uncle Ernesto taught me

954
01:44:54,888 --> 01:44:58,380
was to always keep a promise.

955
01:45:15,642 --> 01:45:18,873
To María Luisa,
my mother
