and that particular night,
it was me--

86
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,809
uh, to decide who got passed

87
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,719
and--and who would get
to go on during the week

88
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,189

<i>I first saw him</i>
<i>on "The Tonight Show,"</i>

and I thought,
"Well, who's this guy?"

102
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,629
My mother is Jewish,
and my father is Catholic.

103
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,829
That is the truth.

104
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,369
I was raised Catholic formally.

105
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,439
Although I must say,
the Jewish mind comes out

106
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,939
even in the Catholic system.

107
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,039
Uh, give you an example, uh,
we used to go into confession,

108
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,079
and I would bring
a lawyer in with me.

109
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,060

110
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,669

111
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,389

112
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,319

115
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,829
<i>You know, it's interesting</i>
<i>where comics start out</i>

116
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,229
<i>and where they end up.</i>

117
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:09,049
Some end up in movies.
Some end up in sitcoms.

118
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,449
Some end up just being

119
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,449
concert performers, you know.

120
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,349

121
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,259
this guy.

00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,059
thank you,
and hi, I'm Bill Maher,

125
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,749
and this is
"Politically Incorrect."

126
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,479
"Politically Incorrect" was--

127
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,249
I was 35 or something
when I started it.

128
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,789
<i>The idea was always--</i>
<i>from the beginning</i>

129
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,189
<i>and to this day--</i>

130
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,939
to approximate...

131
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,109
what goes on in my life

132
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,739
when I'm just hanging out
with my friends.

133
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,109
I always saw the show
as a cocktail party

134
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,519
with the audience as just

135
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,919
one more friend.

136
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,749
All right,
fasten your seat belts

137
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,049

Let's get to the issues!

138
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,359
[laughs]

139
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,559
Put your thinking cap on.
All right.

140
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,609
43% of--
of Evangelical Christians

141
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,879
believe that the devil
is to blame

142
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,519
for the gay rights movement.

143
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,399
The--the other 57% think

144
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,269
it is the, uh,
high school music teachers.

145
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,369
That's...
[laughter and applause]

146
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,509
You've said that 1995
is the year of the penis.

147
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,979
What can we expect?
[laughs]

148
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,279
I support hunters having guns

149
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,849
'cause that increases the odds
of two rednecks

150
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,509
blowing each other's heads off.

151
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,679
[laughter]

152
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,049
You seriously think...
Wait a minute.

153
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,269
You're gonna run out of air?
I do.

154
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,139
I think there's a hole
in the ozone layer,

155
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,769
I think there's global warming,

156
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,369
I think the ice caps
are melting,

157
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,010
and when I die,
I'm blaming you.

158
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,999
<i>I certainly had never seen</i>
<i>a show like it.</i>

159
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,899
He was deliberately
being provocative

160
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,799
because he's always been
infuriated by the fear

161
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,639
<i>of shaking it up...</i>
I'm leaving.

162
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,589

<i>Of saying things that,</i>

their scotch, their Prozac,
their Valium?

175
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,549

and with political commentary.

180
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,659
Chris, uh, how did you find
New Hampshire itself?

181
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,949
This is, I assume,
your first trip up there.

182
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,519
It's, um--it's--

183
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,849
This is America.

184
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,619
This is-- this is a really,

185
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,189
really, really white town.

186
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,439
This is, uh...

187
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,409
I'm having a real hard time...
Yeah.

188
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,209
Trying to find
hair care products here.

189
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,279
[laughter and applause]

190
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,919
Really...
[laughs]

191
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,819
[applause]

192
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,389
<i>Bill's biggest influence</i>
<i>in comedy</i>

193
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,389
has always been Johnny Carson,

194
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,269
and so Bill not only
admired the interviews,

195
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,009
not only admired the monologue,

196
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,679
but he also admired

197
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,109
Art Fern or Aunt Blabby.

198
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,399
Good evening.

199
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,869
I am the beautifu.

200
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,399
[laughter]

201
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,869
Certainly don't want
any violence.

202
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,069
Let's bring her out!

203
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,609
Monica! Monica!

204
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,079
[audience booing]

205
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,629
<i>So we did sketches</i>
<i>for a long time</i>

206
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,699
<i>that kind of served to be</i>

207
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,299
<i>a bridge between</i>

208
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,899
more traditional
talk-variety formats

209
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,869
and then the absolutely
revolutionary format

210
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,369
that we were moving toward.

211
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,879
Once New York starts
going down--

212
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,159
or LA, which is certainly
going down,

213
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,899
um, as we speak.

214
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,059
'Cause of the earthquake.

215
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,399
I get it.
[laughs]

216
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,769
Do you want to screw
Margaret Thatcher?

217
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,119
Yes or no.

218
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,449
There's your answer!

219
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,819
It's been-- it's been a while

220
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,319
since I've been with
a older white woman.

221
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,289
[laughter]

222
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,859

00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,199
[applause]

224
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,099
"Politically Correct"
was a designed train wreck

225
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,669
Oh, yeah!

226
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,699
<i>The whole point of the show</i>
<i>was that you were</i>

227
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,469
<i>putting together people</i>
<i>who shouldn't be</i>

228
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,549
talking to each other.

229
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,059
Cool!

230
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,089
Janeane Garofalo
right over there!

231
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,059
Glad you can join us.
It's great to be here,

232
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,599
especially for me to be
back together

233
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,129
with all these nuts again, huh?

234
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,799
[laughs]
You will treat me

235
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,579
and every other woman
with respect...

236
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,149
I don't mean here.
And dignity!

237
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,689
<i>And sometimes it--</i>

238
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,319
<i>it just revealed</i>

239
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,919
what a crazy
Democratic nation we are,

240
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,929
where everyone gets a say.

241
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,609
And everyone did.
I'm sure you do.

242
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,149
And I am tired of the press
getting beat up.

243
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,709
Oh, of course you are,
'cause you are the most

244
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,049
hypersensitive people in
the United States of America.

245
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,819
[laughter and applause]

246
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,819
<i>I loved that he would</i>

247
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,239
from opposite ends
of the political spectrum

248
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,709
d everywhere in between,
and he could talk

249
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,839
<i>to everyone and challenge them</i>

250
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,049
<i>or agree with them</i>

251
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,519
<i>and back up his opinion</i>
<i>with facts.</i>

252
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,029
I always learned something

253
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,429
from watching his shows.

254
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,999
I'm a communist,
and I think that the people

255
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,509
should have control

256
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,069
over their own destiny...
By the way...

257
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,809
And over the profits...
Did you read any

258
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,209
of the history
of the 20th century?

259
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,679
'Cause they did try communism.

260
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,129
You defended the Menendez kids.

261
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,169
What do you care about facts?
ll, e, you absolutely

262
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,439
don't know anything
about the facts.

263
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,839
I knew they blew
their parents' heads off.

264
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,709
No, they didn't.
What did they do?

265
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,489
They--they, uh,
unloaded shotguns

266
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,789
in their direction,
but they didn't

267
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,629
blow their heads off.
[laughter]

268
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,729
Hey!

269
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,169
I distinctly remember
all the critics saying,

270
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,519
"This person is crazy.

271
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,349
"The one area you never
want to do

272
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,989
for entertainment--
that's poison--is politics."

273
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,259
[laughter]

274
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,529
And definitely don't have
your own opinions.

275
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,529
[laughs]
You know, definitely the host

276
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,199
was not supposed
to have opinions.

277
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,179
Isn't a religion just a cult
that doesn't have

278
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,379
to pay taxes,
and shouldn't it pay them?

279
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,589
What about suggesting
that parents watch their kids

280
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,559
instead of trying--
as we seem to be doing--

281
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,159
to childproof the world?

282
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,979
Does show business
turn people into jerks,

283
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,879
or are jerks attracted
to show business?

284
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,419
[laughter]
Who is writing this show?

285
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,179
This is unbelievable.

286
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,049
I just fell in love with him

287
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,789
fr that first day.

288
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,219
<i>He was irreverent.</i>

289
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,789
<i>He said things that</i>
<i>you thought to yourself,</i>

290
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,159
"Did he just say that?"

291
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,549
If being single was a disease,

292
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,779
I could listhe symptoms:

293
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,779
extra money, self-reliance,

294
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,919
and not needing
a special holiday to remind us

295
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,749
to get laid.

296
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,169
<i>And then you said, "Yes,</i>
<i>he just said that."</i>

297
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,909
And it was really,
really funny,

298
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,179
and then you realize
that it was also

299
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,379
<i>really, really wise.</i>
Now, America, we're told,

300
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,649
is a land where anybody
can grow up to be president,

301
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,179
but I think even Betsy Ross

302
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,119
would have added, "Yeah,
but for God's sake,

303
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,739
not Donald Trump."

304
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,969
[laughter]

305
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,209
<i>From the beginning,</i>
<i>people thought</i>

306
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:27,179
"Politically Incorrect"
was just a cute...

307
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,709
saying, but it's actually

308
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,229
something
that meant something to me.

309
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,069
<i>The world</i>
<i>was too politically correct.</i>

310
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,569
<i>I still think the world</i>
<i>is too politically correct.</i>

311
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,839
<i>Now, that's not to say</i>
<i>that there aren't some areas</i>

312
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,109
where we do evolve.

313
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,889
I've gotten a lot of mail
from women who say,

314
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,359
you ow"When you bring women
on the show"--

315
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,429
I very often have
a bad habit of--

316
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,499
a lot of times, I know them,
and I say, "Hey, beautiful,"

317
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,069
or some word like that.

318
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,069
Hey, baby.
How are you, baby?

319
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,469
Hey, baby.
Hiya, doll.

320
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,039
[applause]

321
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,869
How you been?
Oh, man,

322
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,259
you must be getting a lot.

323
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,859
Eh, you don't want
to talk about it here.

324
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,029
Hey, beautiful.
How you doing?

325
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,759
Nice to see you.

326
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,149
Go ahead.

327
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,679
[whists and applause]

328
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,879
I'm gonna miss doing that.

329
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,989
I like it, but I have
learned something:

330
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,619
if it hurts a woman,
just don't do it.

331
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,489
Doesn't matter--you don't have
to know why.

332
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,920
So I promise
I won't do it anymore.

333
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:23,499
<i>It</i> and it didn't mean <i>cept</i>
<i></i>liberal or conservative.<i>,</i>

334
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,969
It just meant the opposite
of politically correct,

335
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,449
which was bullshit.

336
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,349
I always used to definit
the elevation

337
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,059
of sensitivity over truth.

338
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,019
<i>This just in,</i>
<i>you are looking at,</i>

339
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,439
<i>obviously, a very disturbing</i>
<i>live shot there.</i>

340
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,779
Th is the <i>World Trade Center,</i>

341
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,379
<i>and we have unconfirmed reports</i>

342
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,379
<i>this morning that a plane</i>
<i>has crashed into one</i>

343
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,949
<i>of the towers</i>
<i>of the World Trade Center.</i>

344
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,019
<i>Six days after 9/11,</i>

345
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,389
the president,
George Bush, had said,

346
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:51,139
"Unless you go back to doing
what you normally do,

347
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,779
the terrorists win."

348
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,179
I took that seriously.

349
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,519
Now, I hope, panel,
that you answer

350
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,719
with total candor,

351
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,699
because
political correctness itself...

352
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,339
is something we can
no longer afford.

353
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,469
Feelings are gonna get hurt

354
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,079

<i>Every time I walk into</i>
<i>the writers' meeting,</i>

531
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,159
<i>it's been the same.</i>

532
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,299
I walk in there
with a look on my face

533
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,629
like my mother just died...

534
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,389
because one time, she did.
[laughs]

535
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,149
And so I never want them

536
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:29,419
to know if something bad
is going on in my life.

537
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,689
And the other reason I do it
is because

538
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,849
I want to be a tough crowd

539
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,909
for those writers
and producers.

540
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,249
I-I know that
when they make me laugh--

541
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,749
'cause I'm pretty jaded--

542
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,019
then we got something.

543
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,069
What defense spending really is

544
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,769
is a giant welfare program,

545
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,439
a jobs program
for defense workers

546
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,449
to build crap we don't need...

547
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,119
<i>You know, there's basically</i>
<i>two kinds of talk shows.</i>

548
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,979
<i>There's entertainment ones--</i>
<i>you know, the ones</i>

549
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,189
on late night--
and then there's

550
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,569
the cable news shows,

551
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,009
but this is not like
either one of those.

552
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,339
It's totally original format.

553
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,909
Here's how Sean Spicer

554
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,409
explained alternative facts.

555
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,049
He said it's like
the weather report.

556
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,629
One weather report comes out

557
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,199
and says it's gonna be cloudy.

558
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,269
Another says there's gonna be
light rain.

559
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,439
No one lied to you.

560
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,209
Yeah, you know, sometimes
weathermen do disagree

561
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,659
on what the weather's
gonna be like tomorrow.

562
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,829
But not on what it was like
yesterday!

563
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,459
[laughter]

564
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,500
[cheers and applause]

565
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,199
I think, as the show
has evolved, it's hit upon

566
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,389
a terrific structure
with the short monologue,

567
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,759
<i>then the interview</i>
<i>with a single guest,</i>

568
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,859
<i>then the panel,</i>
<i>then someone comes out</i>

569
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,559
<i>in the middle of the panel</i>
<i>to kind of give it</i>

570
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,799
<i>a little bit of a bump,</i>
<i>and then you end</i>

571
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,749
on a crescendo
with "New Rules."

572
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,819
New rule: I don't care
if Henry Kissinger

573
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,749
is a war criminal
when he starts melting.

574
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,760
[laughter]

575
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,029
You don't just there
and make vagina hands.

576
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,359
[laughter]

577
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,819
New rule: you can't look
at the before and after

578
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,949
and tell me these two
didn't do it on the ane.

579
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,689
New rul[laughter]'t look
at the before and after

580
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,959
New rule:
Sarah Huckabee Sanders

581
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,959
has to try to look
a little less

582
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,749
like the roommate who comes
to the door and says,

583
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,449
"She doesn't want to see you."

584
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,849
[laughter]

585
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,979
<i>"New Rules" is genius.</i>

586
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,389
<i>If something can make you laugh</i>

587
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,219
and also keep you engaged,

588
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,419
it's pretty great television.

589
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,009
New rule: since our new
national position

590
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:32,209
on science is, "Screw it,
we prefer witchcraft..."

591
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:35,079
[laughter]

592
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,339
Let's not just retire
the space shuttle "Atlantis."

593
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,139
Let's drive it to one
of the five stupidest states

594
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,039
and have the locals
beat it with sticks.

595
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,739
[laughter]

596
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,459
New rule: The people--
oh, you're not gonna like

597
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,899
this one...
[lghs]

598
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,569
The people who participate
in the ultra-Orthodox

599
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,269
atonement ritual of kaparot,

600
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:57,769
where you swing a live chicken
over your head three times

601
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:00,109
and read Bible passages
while someone else

602
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,909
holds a baby...

603
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,829
have to look me in the eye
and tell me

604
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,899
there's not some point
in the ceremony

605
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,529
where you're thinking,
"What the fuck are we doing?"

606
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,129
[laughter]

607
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,639
[laughs]
Okay, new rule:

608
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,719
if the tabloids are going
to continue to call

609
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,559
these two "Kimye"
and these two "Billary"

610
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,889
and these two "J-Rod,"

611
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:22,029
they must refer to these two
as "Shitstorm."

612
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,029
[laughter and applause]

613
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,169
My favorite pais the e.

614
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,999
<i>It's sort of Bill</i>

615
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,269
<i>in his full intensity.</i>

616
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,189
<i>You feel like</i>
<i>watching the eclipse.</i>

617
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,929
You know, you have
to wear glasses

618
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,759
because sometimes
it's so intense.

619
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,999
This country
is in quite a pickle.

620
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,249
Conservatives govern
without shame,

621
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,819
and liberals shame
without goveing.

622
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,289
Conservatives govern
[cheers and applause]

623
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:51,229
<i>Some of them</i>
<i>are enormously complex.</i>

624
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,159
And, as always,
they are very ballsy,

625
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,859
and they're very honest.

626
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,549
When did the American dream

627
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:01,019
become this pathwayndent,

628
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,019
this economic death spiral
where workers get paid

629
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,159
next to nothing
so they can only afford

630
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,609
to buy next to nothing
so business are forced

631
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,079
to sell cheaper
and cheaper shit?

632
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,549
Walmart employees can only
afford to shop at Walmart.

633
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:17,699
McDonald's workers can only
afford to eat at McDonald's.

634
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,699
And Hoers itresses
have to wear shirts

635
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,339
they grew out of years ago.

636
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,709
[laughter]

637
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,309
Europe and Latin America,
they take a break every day

638
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,079
between noon and 3:00,
and they call it a siesta.

639
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,909
But let's face it.

640
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:33,169
[laughter and applause]

641
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:35,499
They're fucking in the day,
and we're not.

642
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,209
[laughter]

643
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,769
<i>Bill's editorials</i>
<i>are a lot like the show--</i>

644
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:42,139
<i>that it's this blend</i>
<i>of passion,</i>

645
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,459
politics, and insights
but then also humor.

646
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,729
Now the white supremacists

647
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:50,269
are the federal government.

648
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,899
And it's liberal states
that are under siege

649
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,509
from federal overreach.

650
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:57,079
We're trying to defend
our way of life here

651
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,479
and what we believe in.

652
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,049
We believe in sanctuary cities
and pollution controls...

653
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:05,429
[cheers and applause]

654
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:08,139
And legalized pot
and gun control

655
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,639
and Obamacare and a woman's
right to choose,

656
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,319
and we're going to defend them.

657
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,029
theebels now!

658
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,259
[cheers and applause]

659
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,159
There's a specific group
of Americans out there

660
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,829
whose name I won't mention,
but it begins with "tea"

661
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,699
and ends with "baggers"...

662
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,429
[laughter]

663
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:26,139
No, in America,
when a man puts something

664
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,619
in another man,
it had better be a bullet.

665
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,529
[laughter]

666
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:33,059
There's only one thing
conservatives believe in more

667
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,099
than work, and that's
the God-given right

668
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,819
of rich people to leave
all their money to their kids

669
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:40,349
so they never have to work
a day in their lives.

670
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,849
[laughter and applause]

671
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,549
Meanwhile, on the other side
of the world,

672
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:46,739
this man--
ex-KGB agent Vladimir Putin,

673
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,409
AKA Vlad Bat

674
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,579
AKA The Bodfather...

675
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,749
[laughter]

676
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,919
Is looking to install a stooge

677
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,349
in the country he still hates.

678
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,489
But who?

679
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,889
Who's desperate
and dumb enough?

680
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,209
[sighs]

681
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,979
<i>And the dience,</i>
<i>all of their defenses</i>

682
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,109
are coming down.

683
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,009
All of their force fields
are lowered.

684
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,179
"Oh, this is fun.

685
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,279
I like this man.
He's making me laugh."

686
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,469
And then he--when those
force fields are down,

687
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,599
en he zaps them.
We tell our children

688
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,739
they don't have to fix
their flaws

689
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,769
because it's the world's job

690
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:21,409
to accept everything
about them and love it.

691
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,139
Like they say on reality shows,

692
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:26,759
the most important thing
is just you doing you.

693
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,169
But what if you
is a big asshole?

694
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,799
[laughter and applause]

695
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,239
<i>He really sets up the argument</i>

696
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,659
in a very logical way,

697
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,789
uh, like a procuto

698
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,999
and at the same time
makes you laugh.

699
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,059
That's an incredible gift.

700
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,299
I don't know
the exact definition

701
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,319
of white privilege,
but being able to talk about

702
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,489
grabbing pussies
and how big your dick is

703
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,229
and still getting
elected president--

704
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,859
that's gotta come close.

705
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,229
[with Southern accent]
You know, uh, we don't need

706
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,829
no outside agitators...

707
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,269
[laughter]

708
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:04,099
With their "Make America
Great Again" caps

709
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,049
coming in here
to our clean state

710
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:09,919
and telling uso ta down
our solar panels...

711
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,859
[laughter]

712
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,529
Or how to treat our interns.

713
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,829
[laughter]

714
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:18,179
Here in our state,
we use tiki torches

715
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,549
they way they're supposed
to be used--

716
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,519
for lesbian weddings
on the beach.

717
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,549
[laughter and applause]

718
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:26,019
<i>After the show is over,</i>
<i>I start to go over it</i>

719
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,019
<i>in my mind:</i>

720
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,229
<i>"Oh, I should have said this.</i>

721
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,429
<i>Oh, I shouldn't have</i>
<i>said that."</i>

722
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,659
<i>That's why I love</i>
<i>the editorial,</i>

723
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,909
because I get to work on it
all week long.

724
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:35,349
Sometimes I put in 12, 15 hours

725
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:38,189
to make five or six minutes,
but I get to say it

726
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,089
exactly the way I want
to say it,

727
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:42,309
and it's always something
that no one else is saying

728
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:45,509
and we make it funny,
and, uh...

729
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,009
that's--that's my joy.

730
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,949
<i>[laughter]</i>

731
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,949
Ready, four.
And take.

732
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,639
<i>One of the ways in which</i>
<i>our show is unique</i>

733
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,909
is that we have almost
a true hour on air

734
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:00,569
<i>completely uninterrupted</i>
<i>by commercials,</i>

735
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,909
<i>so Bill is doing</i>
<i>this obstacle course</i>

736
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,849
every week,
which is incredible.

737
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,599
We think of Megyn Kelly
as the sane one

738
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,899
over there at Fox News.

739
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,199
That's just because
she's surrounded

740
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,969
by Hannity and Bill O'Reilly.

741
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,599
She's like the blonde
dragon girl

742
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,869
on "Game of Thrones."

743
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,809
Everyone else is a zombie
or a dwarf

744
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,989
or fucking their sister,
so she looks normal.

745
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,589
[laughter]

746
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,099
<i>If you think</i>
<i>about the monologues</i>

747
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,499
<i>of the late-night shows</i>
<i>that sometimes have politics,</i>

748
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,629
it was all very tame,
very bland, and that--

749
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:27,939
that stuff came out
of the Bob Hope era,

750
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,999
if you will.

751
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,569
This was a whole
different thing.

752
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:32,769
Anytime someone
prefaces a statement

753
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,939
by saying, "I'm not a racist,"

754
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,989
some racist shit is about
to come out of them.

755
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,399
Now, I mean...

756
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,199
He wanted to outlaw blow jobs,

757
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,599
and he lost single women

758
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,269
in the state by 43 points.

759
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,989
But listen to this.
He won married women

760
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,419
by nine.

761
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,889
[laughter and applause]

762
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,989
And...

763
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:55,429
that is all I need
to know about marriage.

764
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,629
That's--that's all I'm saying.

765
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,899
The budget director also said
about the new budget

766
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,619
that the after-school
meals program--gone.

767
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,819
You know, I've always
said this.

768
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,789
You want Republicans
to care about kids,

769
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:09,259
you're gonna just have
to jam them back in the uterus.

770
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,779
[laughter]

771
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,849
There's almost nothing
on televisn

772
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:15,349
that goes out live-live

773
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:18,519
with no tape delay
and they can't bleep you;

774
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,319
<i>you can say anything you want.</i>

775
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,869
<i>And I think that kind of</i>
<i>edge of danger</i>

776
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,279
<i>is very good for thshow</i>

777
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,609
<i>and I think</i>
<i>it's very good for him.</i>

778
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:29,079
<i>A lot of shows are like a play,</i>

779
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,279
<i>where there's a script</i>
<i>and it gets rehearsed</i>

780
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,549
<i>over and over</i>
<i>and then it gets taped.</i>

781
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,819
<i>And our show is more like</i>
<i>a sporting event,</i>

782
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,969
where there are umpires,

783
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,269
there's--there's spectators,

784
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,309
there's one team,
there's the other team,

785
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:44,349
and then once the game begins,
nobody knows exactly

786
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,409
what's going to happen.
<i>I'm sorry, but it's time</i>

787
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,969
for a comedy bit.
Okay.

788
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,929
augh [mimics cracking]

789
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,639
[laughter]

790
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,939
[speaking indistinctly]

791
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,409
Can I use this for a second?

792
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,269
[laughter]

793
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,309
<i>Being on "Real Time,"</i>
<i>it's like the most interesting</i>

794
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,009
dinner party you ever had
with people that

795
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,949
you don't know very well
but you know of them.

796
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,449
And it's
a fascinating conversation,

797
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,849
and then you realize
it's all taking place

798
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,339
on a high wire 100 stories
above the ground,

799
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,369
and one false move
and you're cooked.

800
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,339
The Obama administration
really has to stop

801
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,439
completely blaming everything

802
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,539
on its predecessor completely.

803
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,399
And I really--
I'm sick of hearing,

804
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,459
"Oh, well, we were handed this.

805
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,659
We were handed this."
I know.

806
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,699
Everyone knows,
but we need to move on.

807
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,029
You think that's
what Obama's doing?

808
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,939
You think he's doing that?
I do, to a degree.

809
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,899
Not nearly enough.

810
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,369
Ronald Reagan
blamed Jimmy Carter every day

811
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,309
for eight years.

812
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,789
[cheers and applause]

813
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:35,259
No--and in the speech--

814
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,899
in the speech,
what President Bush said--

815
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,069
one of the things
he's had to adjust to...

816
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,229
Yeah, I wasn't born yet,
so I don't know.

817
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,139
Well, that's...
[laughs]

818
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,519
I-I wasn't born during
the French Revolution,

819
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,419
but know about it.

820
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,089

[indistinct chatter]

822
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,599
It comes out this week
that Reince Priebus

823
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,009
was talking to the FBI--

824
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,849
he's the chief of staff.

825
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:57,049
That really is booze.
No, it's not.

826
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,649

You wish it was

827
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:00,619

[laughs]

829
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,589
Things that are in the Bible

830
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,159
that if we took it
literally true:

831
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,139
uh, "slaves must
submit themselves

832
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,049
to their masters,
no matter how harsh."

833
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:11,849
Right--right off the bat,
we're believing in slavery.

835
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,549

<i>Bill's success is that</i>
<i>you gotta come prepared.</i>

There are no free passes.

838
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,309
Uh, he's not interested
in sycophants.

839
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,139
He's not interested
in the pabulum

840
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,609
of usual exchange.

841
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:26,349
<i>You gotta bring your "A" game.</i>
This is a tough guy

842
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:27,869
to argue with.
[laughs]

843
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,529
But I mean, look...
[stammering]

844
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,469
Okay, so, Bill, listen...
Hey, if it makes you

845
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,099
feel better, I feel like
I'm in high school again,

846
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,739
where I'm just sitting there
like, "I'm not passing

847
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,339
this class."

848
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,939
[laughter]

849
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,039
You always have said to me,

850
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,229
"I'm too stupid
to do your show."

851
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,029
No, no, I-- no, I didn't say--

852
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:46,399
Have you gotten smarter?
No, sadly.

853
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,199
I saw you a while ago,
and you said something

854
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,089
that changed it, and you said--
I think it was a compliment--

855
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,989
you said, "Oh, are you kidding?

856
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,589
We have guests
much stupider than you."

857
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,529
[laughter]

858
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:58,629
Listen, they gave me
water tonight.

859
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,999
I got nothing.
I know. I know.

860
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,799
Maybe you got his booze.
Is that what he said?

861
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,599
Could we get Darrell Issa's,

862
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,599
uh, Jack Daniels for...

863
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,669
Let's deal with serious issues.

864
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,439
I know.
You know, fuckups

865
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,559
are fuckups, but when you
don't bring Seth MacFarlane

866
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,759
his liquor...
You're wondering why

867
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,299
he's so quiet right now.
It's not gonna be

868
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,029
a good show.
You know it.

869
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,299
[applause]

870
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,729
Thank you so much.
<i>Most other shows,</i>

871

is get the greenroom
conversation on the set.

875

he was involved with her

No, no, you were right.

that could have been worse.

It usually is.
[laughs]

932
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:22,459
It is a great feeling
of freedom

934
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,979

"No, say anything."

from my show

1031
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,699
who I thought was
colossally wrong,

1032
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,899

<i>I think it's important--</i>
<i>especially when you think</i>

1034
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,919
someone is dangerous--
to expose that

1035
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,619
to as manyeoe as you can.

1036
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:45,689

1037
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:48,659
or Anne Coulter a platform,

1038
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,479
that's a public service.

1039
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,179
You id after 9/11
what we should do

1040
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,589
is attack Muslim countries,
kill their leaders,

1041
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,019

to Christianity.

1042
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,449

even when the crowd
does not agree.

1048
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,849
I do think that there is
an element of racism

against white individuals.

1050
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:12,889
I-I do.
I do see it.

1051
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:13,949
I think it's been evidenced.

1052
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,119
Well, since--
since I'm a conservative

1053
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,539
and not a Trump person,
let me just say this:

1054
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,639
that's absurd.

1055
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,939
That's fucking crazy.

1056
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,109
The pope made
a very strong statement

1057
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,469
in support of my position
on climate change.

1058
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,769
Not yours.

1059
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,969
And your position,
when you heard that, was,

1060
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:31,569
"Hey, let's leave the science
to the scientists."

1061
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,609
Okay, first of all,
you're not doing that.

1062
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:36,209
But second of all...
Oh--oh, I am.

1063
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,079
You're not, because 97%
of all scientists believe...

1064
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,319
It's a bogus number.
It's so not a bogus number.

1065
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,079
It's so a bogus number.
Okay, yours is. Mine is.

1066
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,689
Yours is. Mine is.

Thank you for having me
on this show

1077
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:05,239
to present, uh, the other side,
but not every network

1078
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,739
does that all the time.
This might be

1079
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,429
the only place in the world
where we'd ever meet.

1080
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,429
Right.
[laughter]

1081
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,359
Everyone knows that
he gives people room to breathe

1082
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,229
and he gives people
their time to talk

1083
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,469
and make their point, um,

1084
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,419
and he will give you your space
to do that.

1085
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,219
But then when you look
at the Democrats,

1086
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,659
you--you see who's up
against this guy.

1087
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,089
This unbelievably useless,

1088
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,909
terrible candidate

1089
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,479
of Hillary Clinton.

1090
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,419
I feel liberated to say
whatever I believe

1091
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,319
and some of that is not
very popular.

1092
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,319
I've gotten booed
several times by the audience.

1093

<i>Bill is clearly</i>
<i>someone who's a liberal,</i>

1094
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,059
<i>but he's not a party-line guy.</i>

1095
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,439

1097
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:48,819
if you assume
they're always right.

1098
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:52,549
Obama was against
gay marriage in 2008.

1099
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,469
Does he have to resign?

1100
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,669
Hillary came around
just last year.

1101
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,079
Can she be president?

1102
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,609
You can't purge everybody

1103
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:03,459

you did.

1105
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,399

for all of a year

1106
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,439

1107
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,809
"Huh.

<i>that the rest</i>
<i>of the press drops.</i>

1111
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,499
I'll be wondering,
"Why aren't people talking

1112
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,599
abt this subject
or that subject?"

1113
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,329
And sure enough, Bill gets it.

1114
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:25,369
It'll be on his next show.

1115
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:28,509
Denying racism
is the new racism.

1116
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:31,119
Would you agree that there is
some sort of a medical,

1117
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,689
pharmaceutical,
food industry complex

1118
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,329
that are--where there's
a lot of profit

1119
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:37,229
in getting us sick
and a lot of profit

1120
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,979
in selling us pills that
don't really get us better?

1121
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,469
[cheers and applause]

1122
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,599
Um...
[clears throat]

1123
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,599
It can't be the duty
of every American

1124
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,739
to say something
if they see something,

1125
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,289
except for the people
whose job it is

1126
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:49,929
to do something.

1127
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,359
When...

1128
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,400
[cheers and applause]

1129
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:58,019
When--when cops ask minorities

1130
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,749
why they don't snih
on their own,

1131
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:03,019
minorities have every right
to say,

1132
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,089
"You first."

1133
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,489
And...

1134
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,759
[applause]

1135
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,499
After a shooting,
Bill was the first one,

1136
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,829
I think, on air to say,

1137
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:14,079
"It's not enough
to say thoughts and prayers."

1138
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,389
I'm so sick
of all the reactions.

1139
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:18,059
I'm so sick of thoughts
and prayers.

1140
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,119
First of all...

1141
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,739
[applause]

1142
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,409
[laus]

1143
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:28,149
Thoughts are the opposite
of prayers.

1144
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,379
[laughter]

1145
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,769
[applause]

1146
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,909
A thought is, "What should do?

1147
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:37,609
A prayer is wishing on a star.

1148
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,909
Thoughts and prayers are
the Republican way of saying,

1149
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,309
"Tough shit."

1150
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,549
Uh...
<i>You know, I-I think--</i>

1151
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,479
I'm sure I was the first one
to call Bill

1152
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,819
an American treasure on--
on my radio show...

1153
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,169
[laughs]

1154
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,439
And I meant it.

1155
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,639
Uh, mostly because

1156
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,769
the comedy is one thing,

1157
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:55,609
but, um, taking on religion

1158
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,079
is, uh, something else.

1159
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,499
In your album, you say,
"Religion, question religion.

1160
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,159
Question it all."Well.

1161
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,699
You been watching me,
haven't you?

1162
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,799
[laughs]
Religion is a bunch

1163
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,399
of bullshit, and it's, uh...

1164
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,799
That's what I wanted to hear
from you.

1165
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,309
[laughs]
Good to see you, Bill.

1166
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:12,179
Bill, ink,
has a slightly darker view

1167
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,949
of all religion,
and so it's not surprising

1168
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,549
that he has
a slightly darker view

1169
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,079
of Islam,
and I understand that.

1170
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,529
<i>The trouble began on the set</i>

1171
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:21,299

1172
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,139

1178
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:34,159
So we have--we have...
That's just a fact.

1179
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,999
It's--it's not a fact.
It is a...

1180
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,499
It's an ugly thing to say.

1181
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,199
How about the more
than a billion people

1182
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,509
who aren't fanatical,
who don't punish women,

1183
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,959
who just want to go to school,
have some sandwiches,

1184
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,989
five times a day,

1185
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:46,129

all Muslims do...

1187
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:48,799
No, wait, wait, wait.
And stereotyping--

1188
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,099

If you are a liberal,

1199
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:13,089
these are basic
human rights ideas

1200
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,889
that you have to stand behind.

1201
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:17,490
You know, most Muslims
around the world

1202
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:23,249
uAmerican Muslims do
to practice the religion

1203
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:26,179
any way they want,
and American liberals

1204
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,669
should make that their cause

1205
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:31,969
instead of conflating
criticizing a religion,

1206
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:33,869
which is legitimate,
with bigotry,

1207
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,579
which it is not.

1208
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:38,279
We are never going
to, uh, defeat terrorism

1209
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,009
if we don't reform Islam.
Yes.

1210
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:44,019
And we are not going
to reform Islam

1211
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:46,249
if we can't talk about it.

1212
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,989
And if Muslims
can't talk about it.

1213
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:50,609
Political correctness,
by and large,

1214
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:53,309
narrows the argument
and locks you in

1215
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,709
to identity politics

1216
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,999
<i>and all sorts of things</i>
<i>you're not allowed to say</i>

1217
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,599

<i>off the table,</i>

International Women's Day,

1221
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,639

"A woman should be...

1222
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,299
whatever the fuck she wants."

1223
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:17,169
[cheers and applause]

1224
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:19,099
So...

1225
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,039
liberals, you can applaud that,

1226
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,539
or you can pretend

1227
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,819
this is just a fashion trend.

1228
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,929
You just can't do both.

1229
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:28,159
There's a lot of ideas,
I think,

1230
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,329
that were not mainstream
when we first started

1231
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:32,499
to talk about them
that have become mainstream.

1232
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,979
<i>Atheism, you know,</i>

1233
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:36,889
<i>being single is no wor tha,</i>

1234
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:39,219
<i>marijuana...</i>
I never met a mean pothead.

1235
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,959
I've met a mean drunk,
a mean drug addict,

1236
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,389
but every pothead--
even the stupid ones are nice.

1237
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:44,559
I mean...
Right.

1238
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,699
And--and I know it's supposed

1239
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,219
to cure anxiety--
I prefer poppers, myself--

1240
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,979
t however, if...

1241
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,549
[laughter]

1242
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:54,319
I know.
And it doesn't make you stupid.

1243
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,159
Look at you.
[laughs]

1244
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,159
[laughter]
<i>Almost no one</i>

1245
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,179
comes out and says,

1246
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,549
"I smoke weed," on TV,

1247
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:04,579
even though God knows
how many millions

1248
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,949
of people do every day.

1249
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,799
Millions of Americans
are still trapped

1250
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,399
in a no-man's-land

1251
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,769
where a pot dispensary
can sell you weed

1252
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:14,139
if you have a "card"

1253
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,779
from a "doctor"...

1254
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,009
[laughter]

1255
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:19,949
Who certifies

1256
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:22,429
that you have a "disease,"

1257
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:24,629
which is just
"d't a, don't tell"

1258
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:26,899
for pot smokers.

1259
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,639
And...

1260
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,709
[applause]

1261
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:33,089
And it creates a culture
of dishonesty

1262
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:35,659
that gives a bad name
to people like me

1263
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,799
who genuinely suffer
from whatever it is

1264
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,529
I told them I had.

1265
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:42,339
You have given it up for
about a year and a half now...

1266
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,039
Yeah.
Uh, and, uh,

1267
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,469
I think that's great.

1268
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:47,469
When we were in, uh, Hawaii
last year, in solidarity--

1269
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:49,839
I didn't want to temp you,
so I didn't do it around you

1270
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,159
when--when we were together--
but you were one

1271
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,559
of tneers.

1272
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,669
And I'm not gonna try
to get you back on the wagon

1273
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,669
at all, uh, but I just want
to show you--

1274
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:59,239
no, no, I just want
to show you some pictures

1275
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,439
to reminisce.

1276
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,890
<i>Here's us this last year</i>
<i>in Hawaii</i>

1277
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,529
<i>after with Jeff Ross, p pot, </i>
<i>and, you know, you look, uh...</i>

1278
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:08,329
<i>you look okay but not ecstatic.</i>

1279
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:09,659
<i>And, uh--</i>

1280
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,599
<i>But here's the year before</i>
<i>when we were</i>

1281
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,199
<i>completely baked, all right?</i>

1282
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,869
<i>I'm just saying...</i>

1283
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:16,439
<i>[laughter and applause]</i>

1284
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,249
But, uh...
That's a strong case.

1285
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:20,419
That's a...
[laughs]

1286
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,159
Maybe I should, uh...

1287
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,430
[cheers and applause]

1288
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,979
I thought,
"Is he allowed to do this?"

1289
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:29,979
You know?

1290
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,419
"Is he gonna get arrested?"

1291
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,219
Please remember...
[coughing]

1292
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,749
[laughter]

1293
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:36,639
[coughing]
Please remember

1294
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,539
that legalizing pot is a lg wa

1295
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,739
from a done deal.

1296
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,649
I know you're tired--
I am too--

1297
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:45,949
of making the same old
obvious pot arguments,

1298
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:48,079
like how pot is less dangerous

1299
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,819
than other legal
adult activities,

1300
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:52,709
but somehow,
you can drink alcohol;

1301
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:54,239
you can smoke cigarettes;

1302
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,279
you can do that thing
where you cut off your oxygen

1303
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,209
with a belt and masturbate...

1304
00:44:58,210 --> 00:44:59,549
[laughter]

1305
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:01,349
Which is not only dangerous,
but take it from me,

1306
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:04,599
it'll get you kicked out
of Macy's menswear like that.

1307
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,339
[laughter]

1308
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,469
<i>I'm not gonna see</i>
<i>Chuck Todd do that</i>

1309
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:10,109
on "Meet the Press."

1310
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:11,669
That's...
[laughs]

1311
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:13,579
I mean, where are you
gonna e that?

1312
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:14,809
And...

1313
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:17,309
see that person back
on the air next week.

1314
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:18,619
[laughs]
Well, that's one

1315
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,949
of the things he criticizes
Democrats for--

1316
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:22,999
that they were late to pushing

1317
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,699
for marijuana legislation

1318
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,769
and late to pushing harder
on gay marriage.

1319
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:29,239
<i>And he was right out there.</i>

1320
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,429
I never understand why
the gays want marriage.

1321
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:33,299
I always thought the hip thing
aboubeingay

1322
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,999
was that you couldn't
get married.

1323
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,929
[laughter]

1324
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:38,639
Which is why you live
more of a gay lifestyle

1325
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,099
than I do.
Hello.

1326
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,539
[laughter]

1327
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:44,109
If homosexual marriage
comes flooding in,

1328
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:45,579
we will all be losers.

1329
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:48,029
It's going to undermine
the future civilization.

1330
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:50,359
Isn't this a flood
that you can't stop

1331
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,369
no matter how hard you try
to put your finger in the dike?

1332
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:56,799
[laughter]

1333
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,159
<i>He's been one</i>
<i>of the most pro-gay forces</i>

1334
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,929
<i>in popular culture, and I think</i>

1335
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:03,929
<i>he's more effective than most</i>
<i>'cause he's not</i>

1336
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:06,629
<i>some simpering lefty</i>

1337
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,979
LGBTQRS kind of guy.

1338
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,819
[laughs]
Where is the Democrat

1339
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,749
who will stand up and go beyond

1340
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:15,319
the half measures
of civil union

1341
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,919
and, "Hate the sin,
love the sinner,"

1342
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,689
and say loud and clear,
"There is no sin"?

1343
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:23,449
It's not an abomination,
and no one can control

1344
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:25,179
how Cupid aims his arrows.

1345
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:27,949
And the ones who pretend
they can usually turn out

1346
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:30,089
to be the biggest freaks.

1347
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:34,409
[cheers and applause]

1348
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:36,879
Another thing
about the show is, you know,

1349
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,249
you get a sense some people
play to an audience,

1350
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:41,379
including literally
their audience.

1351
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,049
You don't get that, uh,
on Bill's show.

1352
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,219
I mean, he'll challenge
the aud--

1353
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,019
I think he enjoys
challenging the audience.

1354
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,719
You know who's superstitious
about Friday the 13th?

1355
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,889
Republicans.

1356
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,009
They say the country
is having bad luck

1357
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,909
because we let a black cat

1358
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:55,749
in the White House.

1359
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:58,249
[audience groans]

1360
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:00,479
What the fuck was wrong

1361
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,269
with that joke?
[laughter]

1362
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:04,099
If the audience groans

1363
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:07,169
or thinks a joke is too far,

1364
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:08,469
<i>he takes them on.</i>

1365
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:10,879
He doesn't ignore it.
Oh, go fuck yourself.

1366
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,149
I mean, really.

1367
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:13,509
An obvious joke.

1368
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:14,609
Don't start groaning.

1369
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:16,019
I'll go fucking nuts
on you today.

1370
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,799
You can see, I am right
on the edge here.

1371
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,239
Oh, nothatas fucking funny.

1372
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,269
What is wrong with you people?

1373
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:23,739
Fuck you, with the "boo."

1374
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,109
What is the booing?

1375
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:27,159
It's gonna be rough unless
you get that stick out

1376
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,129
of your ass right now.

1377
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:31,359
My relationship
with the audience

1378
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,899
is the relationship of my life.

1379
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,099
Kids?

1380
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,389
I don't have time for kids.

1381
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:38,119
I've got to reite this e.

1382
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,259
[laughter]

1383
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:41,619
It's always where I put
my energy.

1384
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,729
It's what I love the most.

1385
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:45,459
That's my truth.

1386
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,099
That's the way I was born.

1387
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,999
That's what my body
is telling me to do

1388
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,279
and always has.

1389
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,119
It's why I've always
eated e audience

1390
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,219
like they're my friend--
and I mean a real friend.

1391
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,119
I trust them enough
to say things

1392
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,729
they may not want to hear.

1393
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:02,279
We don't agree on everything,
and we don't have to,

1394
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,449
because friends don't
leave each other over that.

1395
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:07,449
We even fight sometimes,

1396
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:09,319
because honesty is love,

1397
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,289
and friends don't
bullshit each other.

1398
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:12,859
The night that people
heckled him--

1399
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:15,109
these hecklers kept
interrupting his show...

1400
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:16,609
See, this is the problem
sometimes with...

1401
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:18,709
[man shouting indistinctly]

1402
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:21,249
Hey, do we have
some fucking security

1403
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:22,519
in this building...
[laughs]

1404
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,279
Or do I have to come over

1405
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,149
and kick this guy's ass
out of here?

1406
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:29,909
Would you get the fuck out
of my building?

1407
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:31,309
Hey, hey.

1408
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:33,939
Hey, hey.
Out! Out!

1409
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:36,179
I just remember
that he had guts, balls.

1410
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,459
I was impressed.

1411
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:39,269
This isn't towa caucus!

1412
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:41,129
[laughs]
Okay?

1413
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:42,169
It's not a debate!

1414
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:43,899
It's a debate between us.

1415
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,269
You're in the audience.

1416
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:47,209
"Audience" comes from the Latin
"to listen."

1417
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:49,779
[laughter and applause]

1418
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,309
What's going on here?

1419
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:53,549
<i>If you're watching,</i>
<i>you don't for one second think</i>

1420
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:56,629
that anything's been altered
to get a rating

1421
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:58,529
or to get anyone's approval,

1422
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:00,439
and I think that's
powerful television.

1423
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,009
Before we go on further
with this topic,

1424
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:04,369
we never really got to
the presidential campaign

1425
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:05,989
last week,
and Donald Trump entered,

1426
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:08,759
and I just want to--
weever really discussed it,

1427
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,259
and I have to say--
I want to ask you two,

1428
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,469
especially,
because I hear all over

1429
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:14,869
the media, "He's just a joke.

1430
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:17,769
"It's just a--it's just
a publicity stunt.

1431
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:19,339
Don't worry about it.
It'll go away."

1432
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,169
It's not going away.
Yeah.

1433
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:22,559
I don't think that
Donald Trump's gonna stay

1434
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,529
at the poll--stay at the top
of theollsor very long.

1435
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:26,259
I do.
I really don't think so.

1436
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:28,699
He makes everybody else
look like a midget.

1437
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:31,149
Not in a good way,
but you know what?

1438
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:33,219
ke, here-- here's the thing

1439
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,589
about Donald Trump.

1440
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:37,189
He never apologizes.
He's never wrong.

1441
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:40,129
No matter what crazy thing
he says, he's totally--

1442
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:41,809
He's the white Kanye.

1443
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:43,049
[laughter]

1444
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:44,049
But isn't this just a promotion

1445
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:45,309
for "Celebrity Apprentice"?

1446
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:46,619
I mean, really.
No.

1447
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,449
That's what I think!
No, no.

1448
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:50,319
No, you're wrong.
<i>A lot of people,</i>

1449
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,889
in the beginning,
either saw Trump

1450
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:54,859
as just funny

1451
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:57,009
and didn't see the danger,

1452
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:59,449
or journalists saw him
as dangerous

1453
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:01,709
and did not see the funny.

1454
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:04,379
I think Bill was the first guy
to see both.

1455
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,369
I certainly don't want
to be shitting on Donald Trump

1456
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:07,939
all night.
[laughter]

1457
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:09,839
Why not?
Oh, I'm just kidding.

1458
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,569
Why not?
Believe me, there's plenty

1459
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:13,239
more shitting to come.
[laughs]

1460
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,639
Did you watch Tuesday?

1461
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,649
Oh, he is--he is getting
a lot closer

1462
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:18,849
to wrapping up the apocalypse.

1463
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:21,249
I have seen this guy
change his position

1464
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:23,589
from the beginning
to the end of a sentence.

1465
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:25,019
Yeah.
"All I know

1466
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,739
is what's on the Internet"?

1467
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,569
This guy's gonna change
America's symbol

1468
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:31,209
from the bald eagle
to a turtle fucking a shoe.

1469
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:32,779
[laughter]

1470
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,479
Where are the other Republicans
to condemn this?

1471
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,729
When are they going to say,
"Look, I get it.

1472
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:40,139
"We handcuffed ourselves
to this deadker

1473
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,609
but at some..."
[laughter]

1474
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:44,909
They see him as a strong
alpha man...

1475
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:46,279
Yes.
Which is amazing to me,

1476
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,409
'cause he's such
a whiny little bitch.

1477
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:50,809
[all chanting]
Whiny little bitch.

1478
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:53,399
Whiny little bitch.

1479
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,969
[cheers and applause]

1480
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:57,039
If there's anything scarier
than the fact

1481
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,369
that Donald Trump thinks

1482
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:00,989
he's the most important person
in the world,

1483
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:03,429
it's that in eight months,
he could be.

1484
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:05,189
Mm!
[applause]

1485
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:07,599
New rule: Donald Trump
must immediately submit

1486
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,669
to DNA tests to determine...

1487
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:12,619
[laughter]

1488
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:15,650
[cheers and applause]

1489
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:18,659
[clears throat]
To determine whether

1490
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,729
he is, in fact, the love child

1491
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:23,029
of a human woman
and an orangutan

1492
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:24,499
from the Brooklyn Zoo.

1493
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,149
[laughter]

1494
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:28,049
<i>Donald Trump was going after</i>
<i>President Obama,</i>

1495
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:30,189
<i>pretending President Obama</i>
<i>wasn't born in America--</i>

1496
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:32,859
which was nonsense
and, I think, code language

1497
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,489
to people with
racial prejudices

1498
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:37,039
to tell them, "You don't
really have to honor

1499
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,309
"the African-American
president.

1500
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:40,279
It's okay.
He's not really one of us."

1501
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,609
<i>So Bill called him on it.</i>

1502
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:44,619
But given your face,
your physique,

1503
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,989
your intelligence level,

1504
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:49,659
and, of course, your hair...
[laughter]

1505
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:51,959
The American deserve
some real proof

1506
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,489
that your mother did not
spend most nights

1507
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:56,649
in 1945

1508
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:58,919
covering her body
in banana oil,

1509
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,779
sneaking into the monkey cage,

1510
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,249
and compulsively humping
an orange-haired ape.

1511
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:04,349
[laughter]

1512
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:06,689
Somebody had to say that.
[laughs]

1513
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,439
He called me and he said,

1514
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,709
"You know, maybe it would
make a good column for you

1515
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,909
because Donald Trump
is suing me."

1516
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:15,079
You're suing Bill Maher.
<i>Yes, and my friends</i>

1517
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,379
<i>at "Fox and Friends"</i>
<i>have it first.</i>

1518
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:19,699
<i>Yeah, I'll sue him</i>
<i>about 12:00 today.</i>

1519
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,699
For how much?
<i>For million,</i>

1520
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,569
<i>all going to charity.</i>

1521
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:24,969
His lawyer sent me a letter.

1522
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:27,279
I shit you not, this is real.

1523
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,249
[laughter]

1524
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:32,630
His lawyer sent me a letter
that says, and I quote...

1525
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,229
[laughter and applause]

1526
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:43,729
<i>Bill will speak truth to power.</i>

1527
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:45,929
<i>He will speak truth</i>
<i>to billionaires.</i>

1528
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:47,699
That's what's needed right now.

1529
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:50,029
This may surprise you,
but I am not a big fan

1530
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:51,669
of Rush Limbaugh.

1531
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:53,039
[laughter]

1532
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,249
However, if you're one
of the people with a website

1533
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:58,159
devoted to making him go away,

1534
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,259
you are part of the problem.

1535
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,299
And, ironically,
you're not even

1536
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,459
a proper liberal

1537
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:06,149
because you don't get
free speech.

1538
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:08,819
I'm telling you, this is gonna
be the death of liberals,

1539
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:12,489
this nitpicky,
intramural attacking of friends

1540
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:14,489
for insufficient purity,

1541
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:16,909
compulsively cleaning up

1542
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:18,879
a little corner theoom

1543
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,749
that's already quite clean...

1544
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:23,019
[laughter]

1545
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:26,119
While there giant piles
of shit everywhere else.

1546
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,649
[laughter and applause]

1547
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:29,289
One of the reasons
I admire Bill

1548
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:30,819
is that he says, "Screw that.

1549
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:33,209
<i>"Yes, I am liberal, but I'm not</i>

1550
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,679
<i>"politically correct.</i>

1551
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,979
"I'm not in chains--

1552
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,979
in the chains
of political correctness."

1553
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:40,229
In a world where it's
too politically correct,

1554
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:43,169
people go to some jackass

1555
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:45,399
because, oh, it is a breath
of fresh air

1556
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,139
from political correctness.

1557
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,239
<i>Donald Trump came along--</i>

1558
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:50,909
<i>and he wasn't the first,</i>
<i>but obviously,</i>

1559
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:52,809
<i>he was sort of</i>
<i>the most significant--</i>

1560
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:55,009
and said, "Okay,
if we currently live

1561
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:58,279
"in a world where everything
is offensive,

1562
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,649
I'm gonna create one
where nothing is."

1563
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:02,969
<i>And people defended that</i>

1564
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:05,009
<i>as standing athwart</i>
<i>political correctness.</i>

1565
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:06,809
<i>Now, that's not</i>
<i>what he was doing,</i>

1566
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,439
but because
political correctness

1567
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,129
had gotten so absurd, he--

1568
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:11,859
it really did allow him

1569
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:13,629
to sort of jump off the cliff.

1570
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:15,739
I'm sorry to have
to kind of be the--

1571
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:17,699
the buzzkill here so early on,

1572
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,909
but I think Trump is gonna win.

1573
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:21,609
I-I'm sorry.
[audience booing]

1574
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:22,979
You know what?
Yeah.

1575
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:24,609
Boo if you want.
I am glad you're saying it.

1576
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:26,199
Everybody should say that--
I don't want to say it.

1577
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,529
No, no, the--the enemy
is complacency.

1578
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:29,729
Yeah.
But you could tell

1579
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:32,839
he was really raw...

1580
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,819
and concerned,

1581
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:37,019
and it's like he knew something
that no one else did.

1582
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:40,229
And I didn't think
for a chance...

1583
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:42,529
that his concerns
were accurate.

1584
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:43,799
I'm gonna be honest with you.

1585
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,479
I've had a couple of drinks.

1586
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,049
[laughter]

1587
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,279
I'm gonna be honest with you.

1588
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,149
You've had more
than a couple of drinks.

1589
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:51,349
[laughter]

1590
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:52,419
I really have.

1591
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:53,889
I mean, I'm shitting
in my pants

1592
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:55,159
because, you know...
[laughs]

1593
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,959
Let me take you back
a couple of years.

1594
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,659
First they said--
everybody said

1595
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:00,509
that Donald Trump,
when he talks about running

1596
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:02,849
fopresident,
"Oh, he's just saying that."

1597
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:05,849
Just saying that because
he wants to, you know,

1598
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:07,549
burnish his brand
and get people

1599
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:08,899
to buy his books or whatever.

1600
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:09,909
Okay.

1601
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:11,409
Then he announced
he was gonna run.

1602
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:14,409
They said, "Well, sure,
he's a reality show star...

1603
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:15,879
"and people think
that's interesting,

1604
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,079
but he's not gonna get
any votes."

1605
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,409
Then he got votes.

1606
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:19,879
Then he-nd tn they said,
"He's not gonna win

1607
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,479
any primaries."

1608
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,949
Then he won primaries.

1609
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,759
Then they said, "But he's not
gonna win the nomination."

1610
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:26,989
Then he won the nomination.

1611
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,679
And now these same people
are saying,

1612
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,479
"He's not gonna win
the election."

1613
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,679
Yeah, he could win
the election.

1614
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,849
<i>This is CNN breaking news.</i>

1615
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:40,139
Donald Trump will be
the 45th president

1616
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,539
<i>of the United States.</i>

1617
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:44,339
I mean...
[laughs]

1618
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:46,139
They're gonna get rid
of Obamacare,

1619
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:47,809
probably get rid
of Roe versus Wade.

1620
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:50,149
So you know what?
Enjoy your victory,

1621
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:51,879
Trump voters,
'cause when you're dying

1622
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,299
because you don't have
health insurance

1623
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:56,099
to treat the inftionou got
from a back-alley abortion

1624
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,869
you had to get
'cause of fetal lead poisoning,

1625
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:01,169
you can say to yourself,
"At least I didn't vote

1626
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:03,689
for someone with
a private email server."

1627
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:06,129
[cheers and applause]

1628
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:07,229
<i>It's interesting,</i>
<i>'cause sometimes</i>

1629
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,099
you'll watch the show
and he'll--

1630
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,029
they'll be talking about
a particular subject

1631
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:13,369
and you go...
[stammering]

1632
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,449
You want everybody
to be watching this.

1633
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:17,419
I ce read the list

1634
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:19,789
of things that Trump does
that sound like

1635
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:21,559
a third world dictator.

1636
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:24,259
Uh, you put your name
on buildings.

1637
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:27,529
You appoint your family members
to positions of power.

1638
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:30,389
Your rallies are scary.
[laughter]

1639
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:32,289
Yote the press and talk about

1640
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:33,919
jailing reporters.

1641
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,089
Uh, you want missile parades.

1642
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:38,239
He doesn't have one,
but he wants one.

1643
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,049
Uh, you use the ofce
for financial gain.

1644
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:43,279
You love other dictators.

1645
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,749
Does anyone agree with me
that he is not going

1646
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:48,789
to leave until
he wants to leave,

1647
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:51,319
including the 2020 election?

1648
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:54,759
He'll probably be reelected.
52% of Republicans

1649
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,359
would support postponing
the 2020 election

1650
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,169
if Trump proposed it.

1651
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:01,949
He takes their side
and not ours.

1652
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:03,149
That's a traitor.

1653
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:05,489
He calls you a lowlife.

1654
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:07,819
You, who spent your life

1655
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:10,709
defending this country,
especially after 9/11.

1656
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:12,379
He's not on our side.

1657
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:13,649
I know this is a comedy show,

1658
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:15,819
and I'm gonna try
to keep it on that level,

1659
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:18,249
but it's not fucking funny.

1660
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:20,589
There is a slow-moving

1661
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:22,639
right-wing coup...

1662
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,509
going on.

1663
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:27,339
Media, do your fucking job.

1664
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:28,679
[cheers and applause]

1665
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,309
<i>Our job is to get</i>
<i>the information out</i>

1666
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:32,009
<i>as best we can, and--</i>

1667
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:34,899
and start to mobilize people
to think.

1668
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,299
And you can do it
with laughter, but you have

1669
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,139
to do it with intelligence
behind it,

1670
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:41,439
and that's what, I think,
Bill does brilliantly.

1671
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,489
You can un-friend someone

1672
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:46,529
whose politics you don't like,
but you can't un-friend

1673
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:48,929
47% of America.

1674
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:51,499
Roommates can move out.

1675
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,169
Patriots can't.

1676
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:55,699
America needs you
more than ever,

1677
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:58,019
right here with me

1678
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,359

Until we can figure ou
w to really

1682
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:11,449
make America great again.

1683
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:13,789
And don't ever
let them forget--

1684
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:15,659
we're still here.

[cheers and applause]

1686
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,579
