1
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,465
The Ancient Ones
said that Jauja

2
00:00:34,655 --> 00:00:37,519
was a mythological land of
abundance and happiness.

3
00:00:37,903 --> 00:00:40,646
Many expeditions tried to
find the place to verify this.

4
00:00:40,881 --> 00:00:43,479
With time, the legend grew
disproportionately.

5
00:00:43,657 --> 00:00:46,302
People were undoubtedly exaggerating,
as they usually do.

6
00:00:46,624 --> 00:00:48,783
The only thing that
is known for certain

7
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,295
is that all who tried to find this
earthly paradise got lost on the way.

8
00:01:15,795 --> 00:01:18,184
Father, why can't I have
a dog of my own?

9
00:01:20,716 --> 00:01:22,593
You will, Inge.

10
00:01:22,596 --> 00:01:24,234
But not until we return home.

11
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:41,594
What kind of dog
would you like?

12
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:45,595
One that follows
me everywhere.

13
00:01:46,326 --> 00:01:48,242
I see...

14
00:01:48,277 --> 00:01:49,750
One like that...

15
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,589
That certainly won't be easy.

16
00:02:03,801 --> 00:02:05,792
I'm sure we'll find a way.

17
00:02:25,724 --> 00:02:27,715
My sweet girl.

18
00:07:22,961 --> 00:07:24,792
Would you like a drink?

19
00:07:34,603 --> 00:07:36,161
Aquavit.

20
00:07:37,483 --> 00:07:41,716
When are we leaving
for the desert fort?

21
00:07:41,724 --> 00:07:43,316
In two weeks.

22
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,275
- It's high time we left.
- Yes.

23
00:07:47,644 --> 00:07:51,160
I'll be in charge of the convoy.
There are several wagons.

24
00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:56,085
I'll prepare a special carriage
for Ingeborg.

25
00:07:57,405 --> 00:07:59,317
So she can travel comfortably.

26
00:08:00,406 --> 00:08:02,044
Or are you leaving her here?

27
00:08:03,206 --> 00:08:05,117
No, she'll come with me.

28
00:08:08,007 --> 00:08:12,683
Is it true, everything they're
saying about Zuluaga?

29
00:08:14,088 --> 00:08:18,081
He's an extremely competent officer.
And brave.

30
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:21,804
- But isn't he a bit crazy?
- People around here talk too much.

31
00:08:23,809 --> 00:08:25,447
Do you know him?

32
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:27,878
Have you spoken to him?

33
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:30,319
Many times.

34
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,402
We've covered many
miles together

35
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,844
and fought side by side.

36
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,166
He's very brave and
level-headed.

37
00:08:38,171 --> 00:08:41,766
He's dependable
and law-abiding.

38
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:46,242
And now we're going
to his fort, right?

39
00:08:46,372 --> 00:08:49,125
Is he there now?

40
00:08:49,132 --> 00:08:53,172
I heard news that he was
in the big fort nearby.

41
00:08:53,173 --> 00:08:57,883
But as soon as the invasion took place,
he rushed to be with his men.

42
00:08:57,893 --> 00:09:00,805
He must be there by now.

43
00:09:00,813 --> 00:09:03,089
He's a very experienced soldier.

44
00:09:04,254 --> 00:09:07,963
In the desert, he can make himself invisible
and travel at the speed of sound.

45
00:09:09,895 --> 00:09:13,570
And he's a very disciplined
military man.

46
00:09:13,575 --> 00:09:15,247
You will like him.

47
00:09:16,215 --> 00:09:18,286
Does he live alone?

48
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,566
Alone?

49
00:09:20,576 --> 00:09:22,931
Does he have a wife?

50
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:25,530
Children?

51
00:09:25,537 --> 00:09:27,414
Or is he like you?

52
00:09:28,257 --> 00:09:31,567
On the desert frontier,
one is alone.

53
00:09:32,817 --> 00:09:36,049
Relationships and comforts
are debilitating.

54
00:09:37,178 --> 00:09:40,215
As you well know,
it's a strange way of life,

55
00:09:40,218 --> 00:09:44,735
to build up a place, a country,
a family.

56
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:48,738
But one must embrace an idea
and push ahead with it.

57
00:09:48,739 --> 00:09:51,493
That's what sets us apart
from the coconut-heads.

58
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,009
They wander from
place to place,

59
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,774
stealing and killing
like complete animals.

60
00:09:56,781 --> 00:09:59,978
Why do you call them
coconut-heads?

61
00:10:02,661 --> 00:10:06,735
That's not a tribe, a coconut...

62
00:10:06,742 --> 00:10:09,620
We consider all of them
coconut-heads.

63
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,812
But it's not a proper name.

64
00:10:11,822 --> 00:10:14,018
The name doesn't matter.

65
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:18,694
But if we don't know their name,
how can we understand them?

66
00:10:18,703 --> 00:10:22,492
We don't need to understand them,
we have to exterminate them.

67
00:10:22,624 --> 00:10:25,218
We have to kill them all.

68
00:10:26,824 --> 00:10:28,098
I see...

69
00:10:33,025 --> 00:10:34,583
Lieutenant Pittaluga,

70
00:10:34,585 --> 00:10:37,578
I have a little problem

71
00:10:37,706 --> 00:10:40,504
between my men
and your soldiers.

72
00:10:41,546 --> 00:10:44,344
There's a lot of... hostility...

73
00:10:44,466 --> 00:10:47,584
Could you talk to my
surveyors tomorrow?

74
00:10:47,587 --> 00:10:49,020
Of course.

75
00:10:49,147 --> 00:10:50,739
- Thank you.
- Of course.

76
00:10:52,147 --> 00:10:55,777
You remember tomorrow there's the ball
being given by the Minister of War?

77
00:10:57,188 --> 00:10:59,338
- It is quite an event.
- Yeah?

78
00:11:00,469 --> 00:11:02,619
I'd like to invite your daughter.

79
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:05,022
My daughter?

80
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:07,567
Birrita could come
along as chaperone.

81
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:11,139
No, but she...

82
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,545
She's not a...

83
00:11:18,471 --> 00:11:20,382
She's my daughter.

84
00:11:24,432 --> 00:11:26,070
Captain Dinesen...

85
00:11:28,352 --> 00:11:31,185
It would be an honour for me
to give you a horse as a gift

86
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,349
for your daughter.

87
00:11:35,753 --> 00:11:38,745
In these parts,
the man who rides is king.

88
00:11:38,873 --> 00:11:40,910
I could teach her to ride.

89
00:11:40,914 --> 00:11:43,826
No, she already
knows how to ride.

90
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:45,472
All the better.

91
00:11:49,595 --> 00:11:52,393
I'd like to invite you to the
ranch where I breed them.

92
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:57,555
- Thank you.
- I have some gorgeous horses.

93
00:12:00,116 --> 00:12:02,789
I'll give it some thought.

94
00:12:02,796 --> 00:12:04,788
I have a chestnut horse.

95
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:06,828
A real beauty.

96
00:12:08,317 --> 00:12:11,036
Thank you.

97
00:12:11,037 --> 00:12:14,110
But first we have
work to do, right?

98
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:33,647
Ingeborg!

99
00:13:37,528 --> 00:13:38,847
Inge!

100
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:44,283
You know Lieutenant Pittaluga,
don't you?

101
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:46,081
You know who I mean?

102
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:48,888
Yes, the man with
the short assistant.

103
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,285
Exactly.

104
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,724
Wherever he goes,
his assistant follows.

105
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,081
Or else the assistant leads the way.
And he follows.

106
00:13:58,211 --> 00:14:01,248
Yes, that sounds right.
In any case...

107
00:14:01,251 --> 00:14:03,607
The other day,

108
00:14:03,732 --> 00:14:06,804
just as I was returning
to the house with Dora,

109
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,167
the little man was at
the fort waiting for us.

110
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:13,530
What did you say?

111
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:17,242
And the Lieutenant was sitting inside.
He said he was waiting for you.

112
00:14:18,493 --> 00:14:21,930
Really?
Is that what he said?

113
00:14:21,934 --> 00:14:23,731
He was in full dress uniform.

114
00:14:23,734 --> 00:14:25,565
No!
I'll be damned!

115
00:14:27,455 --> 00:14:29,491
It wasn't me he
was waiting for!

116
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:32,166
It was you he came to...

117
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:37,049
He came to see you.

118
00:14:37,056 --> 00:14:40,765
Now, you listen to me.
He is much too fond of young girls.

119
00:14:40,776 --> 00:14:44,247
He's a filthy pig!
I won't have you anywhere near him!

120
00:14:45,137 --> 00:14:48,971
- Is that clear?
- Why would I go near him?

121
00:14:48,977 --> 00:14:50,456
Well...

122
00:14:51,698 --> 00:14:53,768
Yes, of course... you're right.

123
00:14:53,898 --> 00:14:55,456
Why would you?

124
00:14:56,618 --> 00:14:58,210
Forgive me.
But...

125
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,209
Oh, my poor girl.

126
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,500
We don't belong here at all.

127
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,097
We'll go home to Denmark soon.

128
00:15:17,341 --> 00:15:19,457
I love the desert.

129
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:24,261
I like how it fills me.

130
00:15:25,582 --> 00:15:27,413
I beg your pardon?

131
00:15:32,943 --> 00:15:34,535
Captain!

132
00:15:39,624 --> 00:15:43,014
- Your horse is ready, Captain!
- Yes, yes! Just a moment!

133
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:28,708
Ingeborg!
Wait a moment!

134
00:16:39,191 --> 00:16:40,670
Damn it!

135
00:16:45,312 --> 00:16:46,791
Birrita!

136
00:18:32,685 --> 00:18:35,075
Corto, come here!

137
00:18:38,086 --> 00:18:39,997
Take your boots off!

138
00:18:40,726 --> 00:18:43,366
Miss Ingeborg,
please return to the camp.

139
00:19:15,651 --> 00:19:17,323
This I shall keep.

140
00:19:56,216 --> 00:19:58,411
Good day.
How are you, Ángel?

141
00:20:09,498 --> 00:20:11,454
Thank you.

142
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,130
Corto...

143
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:23,130
Would you like some cold "mate"?

144
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,376
We drink cold "mate" here.

145
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,530
Father.

146
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,896
Not now, Ingeborg!

147
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:36,051
Look what I found.

148
00:20:36,061 --> 00:20:41,011
Yes... that's fine. But now you can go...
go back to the tent.

149
00:20:43,422 --> 00:20:45,060
Go on!
Move along!

150
00:21:13,866 --> 00:21:17,381
Tell us what you told
the administrator.

151
00:21:17,386 --> 00:21:19,217
I want to hear it from you.

152
00:21:23,027 --> 00:21:24,619
Speak up!

153
00:21:25,907 --> 00:21:27,625
You've much to tell us.

154
00:21:28,908 --> 00:21:31,547
- About the colonel?
- Exactly.

155
00:21:32,268 --> 00:21:35,180
Zuluaga is leading
a band of thieves.

156
00:21:35,188 --> 00:21:38,226
The strange thing is he's
dressed like a woman.

157
00:21:38,229 --> 00:21:40,140
I already told this
to the other officer.

158
00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:42,987
Did you see him?

159
00:21:42,989 --> 00:21:47,188
No, I heard it from some locals
who were with the coconut-heads.

160
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,226
Listen to me, Corto.

161
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,831
Colonel Zuluaga disappeared
in the desert

162
00:21:51,866 --> 00:21:55,704
while trying to reach his
fort to help his soldiers.

163
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:58,827
He was later seen in
two relay stations,

164
00:21:58,831 --> 00:22:00,868
where he changed horses
and had a meal.

165
00:22:00,872 --> 00:22:03,067
He was in perfect shape.

166
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,302
That is all we know.

167
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,223
No news since then.

168
00:22:07,232 --> 00:22:10,350
He never arrived,
and no one saw him again.

169
00:22:10,353 --> 00:22:13,151
Nor has a body been found.

170
00:22:13,273 --> 00:22:15,468
We infiltrated the coconut-heads,

171
00:22:15,473 --> 00:22:17,749
but we learned nothing
from them, right?

172
00:22:19,234 --> 00:22:23,352
Either they've hidden him,
or Zuluaga just vanished into thin air.

173
00:22:25,195 --> 00:22:27,709
The second search party
returned yesterday,

174
00:22:27,715 --> 00:22:29,626
all experienced men,
empty-handed.

175
00:22:30,955 --> 00:22:35,632
One of Zuluaga's horses was
spotted up near the forest.

176
00:22:35,756 --> 00:22:40,433
The horse was in good condition,
grazing calmly, with saddle intact,

177
00:22:40,437 --> 00:22:44,953
carrying the colonel's saddlebags
as if its master were nearby.

178
00:22:44,957 --> 00:22:47,425
But they never found him.

179
00:22:47,437 --> 00:22:50,555
I find it strange that such
an experienced man

180
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:52,435
could get lost in the desert.

181
00:22:53,598 --> 00:22:55,828
Perhaps we overestimated him.

182
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,627
The desert devours everything.

183
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,638
That's when people began
spreading rumours.

184
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,393
You're telling us

185
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,356
that they told you

186
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,956
they saw him leading a band of men,
dressed like a woman.

187
00:23:15,281 --> 00:23:18,432
And what's even stranger,

188
00:23:18,441 --> 00:23:22,196
- the dog... his dog...
- Jersey.

189
00:23:22,202 --> 00:23:25,831
His dog Jersey disappeared
from his pen

190
00:23:25,842 --> 00:23:28,403
the same day as his master.

191
00:23:29,043 --> 00:23:31,841
And therefore,
I'm now asking you...

192
00:23:32,843 --> 00:23:36,200
why would Zuluaga desert?

193
00:23:37,564 --> 00:23:39,998
Why would he dress
up like a woman?

194
00:23:41,884 --> 00:23:44,843
What kind of shit-for-brains
are you people?

195
00:23:48,565 --> 00:23:50,237
Search for him.

196
00:23:51,445 --> 00:23:55,837
Go into the desert and bring
back something from Zuluaga.

197
00:23:55,846 --> 00:23:58,201
Something tangible,
something material.

198
00:23:59,326 --> 00:24:00,965
Use your contacts.

199
00:24:03,687 --> 00:24:05,962
Something material?

200
00:24:05,967 --> 00:24:09,199
Yes.
Something material.

201
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:11,119
Do you understand?
Material.

202
00:24:12,608 --> 00:24:14,246
Something like...

203
00:24:14,248 --> 00:24:18,162
Something like...
the dress he's wearing.

204
00:24:21,089 --> 00:24:22,522
Birrita!

205
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:45,161
Any news on the supplies?

206
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:50,411
Yes, they're on
their way, Pittaluga.

207
00:24:52,293 --> 00:24:54,682
It's always the same story.

208
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:58,328
We're constantly asked
to do the impossible.

209
00:25:00,414 --> 00:25:02,484
I don't understand a
word you're saying.

210
00:25:03,374 --> 00:25:05,366
They've been on their
way for six months.

211
00:25:06,695 --> 00:25:08,333
Don't be vulgar.

212
00:25:09,455 --> 00:25:11,093
Come now, gentlemen.

213
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,369
Well, that was fun...

214
00:25:32,418 --> 00:25:34,329
Are we going to eat now?

215
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:38,931
A bit later.

216
00:26:55,269 --> 00:26:58,067
It seems that you've heard
the rumours too.

217
00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:04,182
The rumours, yes.

218
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,225
But they are only rumours.

219
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:10,302
Rumours spread quickly
in the desert, don't they?

220
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:16,429
I've heard a lot of far-fetched things
about Zuluaga since I got here.

221
00:27:17,711 --> 00:27:19,304
Do you know what I think?

222
00:27:20,392 --> 00:27:23,065
He was an unpredictable officer.

223
00:27:26,873 --> 00:27:28,864
Don't you agree?

224
00:27:28,873 --> 00:27:30,545
No.

225
00:27:35,514 --> 00:27:37,391
Come on, Lieutenant.

226
00:27:37,394 --> 00:27:39,032
Calm down.

227
00:27:40,914 --> 00:27:43,475
This is no time to get upset.

228
00:27:44,515 --> 00:27:47,791
We should be relaxing and
enjoying ourselves now.

229
00:27:57,156 --> 00:28:00,354
Are you going to the ball the
Minister of War is giving?

230
00:28:02,157 --> 00:28:04,432
They say it'll be very elaborate.

231
00:28:06,438 --> 00:28:08,633
We are all going to the ball, sir.

232
00:28:10,518 --> 00:28:12,349
I hope to see you there.

233
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:21,589
Get a good night's rest, Pittaluga.

234
00:30:30,456 --> 00:30:31,935
Ingeborg?

235
00:30:38,457 --> 00:30:39,936
Ingeborg!

236
00:30:45,017 --> 00:30:46,929
Where the hell are you?

237
00:30:48,258 --> 00:30:49,850
Inge!

238
00:30:54,379 --> 00:30:56,973
Mr. Milkibar!

239
00:30:56,979 --> 00:30:59,652
My daughter is not here!

240
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:02,220
She is invisible!

241
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,717
Captain.
Captain!

242
00:33:48,721 --> 00:33:51,633
Let me take care of it.
I know how to find her.

243
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:55,793
Thanks for offering, Lieutenant,
but she's my daughter.

244
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:59,158
Captain Dinesen,
I advise you not to go.

245
00:33:59,962 --> 00:34:03,750
Corto won't dare to flee, not even
for your daughter's great beauty.

246
00:34:39,807 --> 00:34:41,160
Pittaluga...

247
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,078
you're not going anywhere.

248
00:34:44,088 --> 00:34:46,318
You're staying here.

249
00:34:46,328 --> 00:34:48,888
We must go to the
Minister of War's ball.

250
00:38:02,672 --> 00:38:04,152
Does it hurt?

251
00:38:08,193 --> 00:38:09,990
It's a birthmark.

252
00:38:14,954 --> 00:38:16,945
It looks like a constellation.

253
00:38:18,594 --> 00:38:20,313
Or a falling star.

254
00:38:26,435 --> 00:38:28,472
Where is your mother?

255
00:38:34,716 --> 00:38:37,515
I have a feeling this
has happened before,

256
00:38:39,157 --> 00:38:41,227
that we've been
together before.

257
00:38:55,479 --> 00:38:57,310
Where did you come from?

258
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,237
Is that man your father?

259
00:43:08,191 --> 00:43:10,102
- Hello, Captain.
- Good afternoon.

260
00:43:13,392 --> 00:43:15,667
Do you see how the
work's progressing?

261
00:43:17,392 --> 00:43:19,587
Excellent work,
Engineer Malaespina.

262
00:43:21,393 --> 00:43:24,112
Tell me, have you
seen my daughter?

263
00:43:25,033 --> 00:43:28,025
- Your daughter?
- Yes, did she come this way?

264
00:43:29,074 --> 00:43:32,066
- Alone?
- No...

265
00:43:38,275 --> 00:43:40,072
Did you see her or not?

266
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,986
I didn't see her.

267
00:43:44,475 --> 00:43:46,387
I didn't see her, Captain.

268
00:43:53,437 --> 00:43:55,587
Could you give us some water?

269
00:43:55,597 --> 00:43:57,474
Of course.
Go over there.

270
00:43:58,877 --> 00:44:01,631
There's a barrel of water.
Drink as much as you can.

271
00:44:02,758 --> 00:44:04,316
Thank you.

272
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,032
Keep digging!

273
00:44:33,082 --> 00:44:35,312
Would you give him
a little water, please?

274
00:45:45,491 --> 00:45:47,607
Perhaps in the mountains...

275
00:46:06,693 --> 00:46:08,207
Thanks.

276
00:48:11,949 --> 00:48:16,944
<i>The time I went away,
the time I went away</i>

277
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:21,188
<i>My girl wished to come with me,
yes, she wished to come with me</i>

278
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:24,108
<i>No, you cannot go, my dear</i>

279
00:48:24,111 --> 00:48:26,750
<i>It's to war that I am bound</i>

280
00:48:26,751 --> 00:48:31,542
<i>And if I do not fall,
it's to you I shall return</i>

281
00:48:31,552 --> 00:48:35,943
<i>If no danger lay in store,
I'd stay right here with you</i>

282
00:48:35,952 --> 00:48:41,232
<i>But all of Denmark's girls
are counting on me now</i>

283
00:48:41,353 --> 00:48:45,904
<i>And so I wish to fight,
a soldier brave and true</i>

284
00:48:45,913 --> 00:48:49,702
<i>Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!</i>

285
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,317
Zuluaga!

286
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,509
No, please!

287
01:00:25,801 --> 01:00:27,554
Where is she?

288
01:00:28,762 --> 01:00:31,515
Where is she?
Where is my daughter?

289
01:00:37,403 --> 01:00:39,280
Where is she?

290
01:00:40,123 --> 01:00:41,761
Zuluaga...

291
01:02:04,414 --> 01:02:07,611
Where is she?
Where the hell is she?

292
01:03:09,226 --> 01:03:11,146
No!
God damn it!

293
01:03:23,706 --> 01:03:25,163
Rot in hell!

294
01:03:38,866 --> 01:03:40,379
Ingeborg!

295
01:03:45,866 --> 01:03:47,220
Inge!

296
01:04:07,429 --> 01:04:09,147
Where are you?

297
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:15,099
Ingeborg!
Can you hear me?

298
01:04:21,109 --> 01:04:22,470
No, no...

299
01:04:22,505 --> 01:04:24,626
No. Oh, God, no.
Inge!

300
01:08:38,179 --> 01:08:40,130
What the hell?

301
01:11:59,489 --> 01:12:01,207
My sweet girl...

302
01:12:25,452 --> 01:12:27,363
What a shit country!

303
01:12:40,494 --> 01:12:42,166
Come here now!

304
01:18:43,259 --> 01:18:46,616
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

305
01:18:48,820 --> 01:18:51,254
Do you have a little water?

306
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:53,491
The water is for everyone.

307
01:18:53,501 --> 01:18:56,538
Go up there.
You'll find a spring back there.

308
01:19:04,022 --> 01:19:05,933
Just go over there.

309
01:20:58,956 --> 01:21:00,709
Is there anyone here?

310
01:21:20,399 --> 01:21:22,959
I was looking for the
owner of the house.

311
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,712
Well, you've found her.

312
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:29,472
Have a seat.

313
01:21:43,602 --> 01:21:45,160
Do you live alone here?

314
01:21:46,122 --> 01:21:49,832
Yes. Well, with my dogs
and my spring.

315
01:21:54,483 --> 01:21:56,475
Please help yourself.

316
01:21:59,644 --> 01:22:01,475
Eat, eat.

317
01:22:06,525 --> 01:22:08,561
Did the water taste good?

318
01:22:11,245 --> 01:22:12,918
Splendid.

319
01:22:15,366 --> 01:22:19,245
The well is 50 metres deep.
My husband discovered it.

320
01:22:20,247 --> 01:22:23,796
My husband was bitten by a snake
and died. Do you like snakes?

321
01:22:27,448 --> 01:22:30,997
They're not very well liked,
but I can't fault them.

322
01:22:33,168 --> 01:22:35,808
No, I don't actually
like them much.

323
01:22:40,209 --> 01:22:44,249
You must forgive me,
but I'm used to talking to my dog.

324
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:46,810
It's strange for me
to talk to a man.

325
01:22:48,370 --> 01:22:50,406
Are you a man?

326
01:22:53,611 --> 01:22:55,442
Yes, I think so...

327
01:22:57,411 --> 01:22:59,323
Where are you going?
Is it far?

328
01:23:03,172 --> 01:23:05,083
I don't know.

329
01:23:08,733 --> 01:23:10,689
I'm looking for my daughter.

330
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:47,538
I thought you might have seen a
blonde girl somewhere around here.

331
01:23:49,058 --> 01:23:50,855
What did she look like?

332
01:23:54,658 --> 01:23:56,331
Blonde...

333
01:23:57,339 --> 01:23:59,330
Very young...

334
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:03,418
She was...
She is... 14...

335
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:05,536
No, 15 years old.

336
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:09,898
No.
What did my mother look like?

337
01:24:12,061 --> 01:24:14,052
Your mother?

338
01:24:15,101 --> 01:24:18,298
I mean, what did the girl's
mother look like?

339
01:24:20,142 --> 01:24:21,621
Why?

340
01:24:23,102 --> 01:24:25,980
I've always wanted to know.

341
01:24:36,824 --> 01:24:40,658
She was quite tall.
And beautiful.

342
01:24:42,665 --> 01:24:44,895
Unbearably beautiful.

343
01:24:46,905 --> 01:24:49,373
Rather highly strung.

344
01:24:52,026 --> 01:24:56,099
She was like a carnivorous plant
that grows at night,

345
01:24:56,106 --> 01:25:00,146
focusing all of its energy on
the insect it wants to devour.

346
01:25:04,627 --> 01:25:07,017
Perhaps she's happy.

347
01:25:09,588 --> 01:25:12,819
She left us just after
you were born.

348
01:25:19,389 --> 01:25:22,587
It's rather unusual for a mother
to abandon her child.

349
01:25:25,350 --> 01:25:27,784
And now the girl is gone?

350
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:32,386
Yes, she's gone now too.
So it seems.

351
01:25:34,751 --> 01:25:37,106
Where did she run away from?

352
01:25:38,712 --> 01:25:40,589
From nowhere.

353
01:25:41,392 --> 01:25:45,783
You see, she doesn't have a home.
Neither do I.

354
01:25:47,193 --> 01:25:49,548
We travel from place to place.

355
01:25:51,513 --> 01:25:53,663
Doesn't she have any family
she could go to?

356
01:25:53,673 --> 01:25:57,030
No.
I am her only family.

357
01:25:59,274 --> 01:26:04,190
All families disappear eventually,
even if it takes a long time.

358
01:26:05,555 --> 01:26:08,752
They're wiped off the face of the earth.
The desert swallows them up.

359
01:26:08,875 --> 01:26:10,753
I think it's for the best.

360
01:26:26,958 --> 01:26:29,153
I'm looking for my daughter.

361
01:26:30,918 --> 01:26:34,468
If you'd like to come back
sometime for a longer visit,

362
01:26:34,479 --> 01:26:36,788
I'll always be here.

363
01:28:16,891 --> 01:28:19,929
One man is not all men.

364
01:28:48,855 --> 01:28:51,394
I now remember a boy...

365
01:28:51,692 --> 01:28:56,011
I saw one evening
after sunset.

366
01:29:02,777 --> 01:29:07,898
It was an ordinary day,
like all other ordinary, dull days.

367
01:29:09,978 --> 01:29:12,287
The dog was leading him.

368
01:29:12,298 --> 01:29:15,291
Because dogs like
to make friends.

369
01:29:22,140 --> 01:29:27,419
The little girl in me
dreams of dogs,

370
01:29:28,820 --> 01:29:33,337
and wild animals and wild men.

371
01:29:35,141 --> 01:29:40,136
She dreams of blood running
over the cliffs, into the sea.

372
01:29:41,742 --> 01:29:45,338
But the little girl became a woman
and lives in the desert.

373
01:29:45,343 --> 01:29:47,811
And she doesn't put up
with any nonsense!

374
01:30:05,265 --> 01:30:09,145
What is it that makes a life
function and move forward?

375
01:31:02,192 --> 01:31:03,864
I don't know...

376
01:32:19,122 --> 01:32:24,322
What is it that makes a life
function and move forward?

377
01:35:43,788 --> 01:35:45,540
Good morning, dear Wilbjørk.

378
01:35:45,548 --> 01:35:47,266
Have you seen Henrik?

379
01:35:51,669 --> 01:35:53,307
No, I haven't.

380
01:35:54,389 --> 01:35:59,384
He said he was going
to the hockey game.

381
01:36:01,230 --> 01:36:03,903
The dog is doing a
lot better now.

382
01:36:03,910 --> 01:36:08,905
I put ointment on him and
gave him some antibiotics.

383
01:36:09,751 --> 01:36:11,548
So that's a good thing.

384
01:36:14,271 --> 01:36:16,786
It's the first time he's had
something like that.

385
01:36:16,792 --> 01:36:20,228
I'd heard about this,
but none of my dogs had ever had it.

386
01:36:21,672 --> 01:36:23,743
It's a hot spot.

387
01:36:23,753 --> 01:36:25,152
A hot spot?

388
01:36:25,153 --> 01:36:30,307
It's a nervous reaction
in the animal.

389
01:36:32,794 --> 01:36:34,546
Like smoking?

390
01:36:35,514 --> 01:36:38,712
When he doesn't
understand something,

391
01:36:38,715 --> 01:36:41,787
he scratches himself furiously.

392
01:36:41,795 --> 01:36:46,745
It irritates him,
and he can injure himself.

393
01:36:46,756 --> 01:36:48,712
What is it he doesn't
understand?

394
01:36:51,236 --> 01:36:55,549
He doesn't understand why
you go away for so long.

395
01:36:59,677 --> 01:37:01,747
I'm here now, though.

396
01:37:01,757 --> 01:37:03,510
I'm home again.

397
01:37:06,358 --> 01:37:11,114
These creatures know a lot
more than people realise.

398
01:37:12,439 --> 01:37:14,316
They make plans.

399
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:23,912
I'm going for a walk.
