1
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,594
<i>Middleburg is a middle-size town</i>
<i>in the middle of the country.</i>

2
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:25,933
<i>But sometimes, in my dreams,</i>
<i>it felt like someplace else.</i>

3
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:29,771
<i>Somehow familiar,</i>
<i>but also very strange.</i>

4
00:00:40,016 --> 00:00:43,618
<i>Middleburg is where i live,</i>

5
00:00:43,654 --> 00:00:46,954
<i>and so does something... else.</i>

6
00:00:56,032 --> 00:00:58,099
<i>Some people thought</i>
<i>middleburg was dull,</i>

7
00:00:58,134 --> 00:01:00,001
<i>that nothing ever</i>
<i>happened here.</i>

8
00:01:00,036 --> 00:01:02,904
<i>Well, they were very wrong.</i>

9
00:01:54,023 --> 00:01:56,958
Francis?

10
00:01:59,028 --> 00:02:02,864
Francis, time to
get up, honey.

11
00:02:09,473 --> 00:02:12,006
Franny?

12
00:02:13,744 --> 00:02:16,043
<i>My name is francis</i>
<i>bacon mccausland.</i>

13
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,945
<i>I'm fourteen years old.</i>

14
00:02:17,981 --> 00:02:21,616
<i>That morning i was</i>
<i>extremely tired.</i>

15
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,656
It's so dark.

16
00:02:28,692 --> 00:02:30,925
Must be a storm front moving in.

17
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,394
Not according to the barometer.

18
00:02:32,429 --> 00:02:33,961
Maybe it's the
end of the world.

19
00:02:33,997 --> 00:02:35,963
It sure feels like it.

20
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:38,867
How would you know what the
end of the world felt like?

21
00:02:38,902 --> 00:02:40,268
You've never felt it
before, have you?

22
00:02:40,303 --> 00:02:41,969
Maybe the clocks
are wrong.

23
00:02:42,005 --> 00:02:42,970
Hope springs eternal.

24
00:02:43,006 --> 00:02:43,971
I always set our clocks

25
00:02:44,007 --> 00:02:45,973
by the naval
observatory web site.

26
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:47,074
I'll check it out.

27
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,143
Bert, trash, and don't
forget the paper.

28
00:02:49,178 --> 00:02:51,979
Why do i always have to
take out the garbage?

29
00:02:52,015 --> 00:02:53,014
Because with age comes
responsibility, bert.

30
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:54,982
When you go to college,
your sister, francis,

31
00:02:55,018 --> 00:02:56,551
will take the trash out.

32
00:02:56,586 --> 00:02:58,986
I wanna get a dog, so he
could eat the garbage,

33
00:02:59,022 --> 00:03:00,288
and he could fetch
the newspaper.

34
00:03:00,323 --> 00:03:01,956
Dogs have germs.

35
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:04,492
What would you do with it
when you went to college?

36
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:06,628
They don't allow dogs
in the dorm room.

37
00:03:06,663 --> 00:03:08,930
Maybe you could put
it on the roof.

38
00:03:08,965 --> 00:03:09,931
Get real, francis.

39
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:10,932
Grow up, bert.

40
00:03:10,967 --> 00:03:12,767
Get a real grown-up.

41
00:03:12,803 --> 00:03:14,936
Aw, jeez, what
happened to the eggs?

42
00:03:14,971 --> 00:03:16,938
There were two dozen eggs
in the fridge last night.

43
00:03:16,973 --> 00:03:17,939
Now there aren't any.

44
00:03:17,974 --> 00:03:18,940
Cold cereal again.

45
00:03:18,975 --> 00:03:19,941
I didn't do
anything with 'em.

46
00:03:19,976 --> 00:03:21,443
No one's blaming
you, francis.

47
00:03:21,478 --> 00:03:23,377
I'm the one they always blame for everything.

48
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:25,179
That's because you have so much pent up aggression.

49
00:03:25,214 --> 00:03:26,581
I do not!

50
00:03:26,616 --> 00:03:27,949
All right, you two!

51
00:03:27,984 --> 00:03:29,651
We're not talking about
aggression right now.

52
00:03:29,686 --> 00:03:30,952
That's what family
time is for.

53
00:03:30,987 --> 00:03:32,053
Now we are simply
trying to determine

54
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:33,955
what has happened
to the eggs.

55
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,392
It's 4:23 a.m.

56
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:39,961
the clocks say 7:23.

57
00:03:39,996 --> 00:03:41,963
The clocks are wrong.

58
00:03:41,998 --> 00:03:45,934
I told you it was the
end of the world.

59
00:03:51,007 --> 00:03:52,974
<i>It was hard to get</i>
<i>back to sleep.</i>

60
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:56,077
<i>I kept wondering why all the</i>
<i>clocks had been sped up.</i>

61
00:03:56,112 --> 00:04:00,882
<i>But i knew there had to</i>
<i>be a logical explanation.</i>

62
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:19,534
Hee hee hee.

63
00:04:21,972 --> 00:04:24,572
That's it. Come here.

64
00:04:24,608 --> 00:04:27,208
Come here. Ha ha ha.

65
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,946
<i>Most kids my age go</i>
<i>to middle school,</i>

66
00:04:31,982 --> 00:04:32,947
<i>but i skipped a grade.</i>

67
00:04:32,983 --> 00:04:33,948
Hi, bert.

68
00:04:33,984 --> 00:04:35,449
Hey.

69
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:36,951
<i>You shouldn't waste a</i>
<i>lot of time growing up.</i>

70
00:04:36,987 --> 00:04:37,952
Jo?

71
00:04:37,988 --> 00:04:38,953
Oh! Hi.

72
00:04:38,989 --> 00:04:40,522
Hi.

73
00:04:40,557 --> 00:04:42,991
So, um, why don't you want
to take the bus to school?

74
00:04:43,026 --> 00:04:45,793
Joanne, nobody rides
the bus to high school.

75
00:04:45,829 --> 00:04:47,729
It's just for children.

76
00:04:47,764 --> 00:04:50,965
I wish i could skip a grade so i could go to high school.

77
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:53,968
Bert does have another year
after this, doesn't he?

78
00:04:54,004 --> 00:04:56,203
If he's lucky.

79
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:58,339
Well, why do you care
when bert graduates?

80
00:04:58,374 --> 00:05:00,875
Ahh... did i tell you
our alarm clocks

81
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:02,810
went off three hours
early this morning?

82
00:05:02,846 --> 00:05:03,945
Really?

83
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,914
Yep.
And mom says the neighbor's clocks were wrong too.

84
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:07,615
Can you believe that?

85
00:05:07,651 --> 00:05:09,617
Well, yeah. Our clocks
did the exact same thing.

86
00:05:09,653 --> 00:05:11,085
They were all
three hours early.

87
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,820
It's so weird.

88
00:05:12,856 --> 00:05:13,922
Well, it's only weird
because you don't have

89
00:05:13,957 --> 00:05:16,925
a logical
explanation for it.

90
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,294
Uh, why is that
dog on the roof?

91
00:05:27,804 --> 00:05:29,671
Now that's weird.

92
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:39,948
<i>Maybe it was some kind of</i>
<i>magnetic... you know... like...</i>

93
00:05:39,983 --> 00:05:41,182
<i>like a power surge.</i>

94
00:05:41,217 --> 00:05:43,952
<i>Why would that make</i>
<i>dogs get on the roof?</i>

95
00:05:43,987 --> 00:05:45,954
I was talking about the
clocks being wrong.

96
00:05:45,989 --> 00:05:46,955
Good morning, francis.

97
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,957
Good morning,
mr. Kepler.

98
00:05:48,992 --> 00:05:50,257
He's my
biology teacher.

99
00:05:50,293 --> 00:05:51,659
He really likes me.

100
00:05:51,695 --> 00:05:53,962
Does he make you cut
up frogs and stuff?

101
00:05:53,997 --> 00:05:56,330
That is <i>so</i> gross.

102
00:05:56,365 --> 00:05:58,600
I <i>love</i> biology.

103
00:05:58,635 --> 00:06:02,436
See, yesterday we got take this chicken embryo--

104
00:06:10,947 --> 00:06:13,648
why is that guy
staring at us?

105
00:06:14,951 --> 00:06:17,719
What... guy?

106
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,928
Well, we was
just right there.

107
00:06:26,963 --> 00:06:28,562
Ok, francis.

108
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:31,933
I gotta get going, but i'll see
you here after school. Ok?

109
00:06:31,968 --> 00:06:33,668
Ok.

110
00:06:35,872 --> 00:06:38,906
Ah, gorgeous.

111
00:06:58,995 --> 00:07:02,130
The egg, or ovum,

112
00:07:02,165 --> 00:07:07,201
may be surrounded by as many as
three protective membranes.

113
00:07:07,236 --> 00:07:12,874
Ha ha ha ha ha!

114
00:07:13,943 --> 00:07:16,144
Ho ho ho ho! Hee hee hee hee!

115
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:17,311
Huh?

116
00:07:21,384 --> 00:07:26,921
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

117
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:41,903
What is this?

118
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:51,946
That's the wonder
of the egg.

119
00:07:51,981 --> 00:07:54,916
And now, the
secondary membrane--

120
00:07:56,986 --> 00:07:58,686
do you have a question, francis?

121
00:08:01,758 --> 00:08:04,892
Actually i do, mr. Kepler.

122
00:08:04,928 --> 00:08:10,765
Ahh, did your alarm clock go off
three hours early this morning?

123
00:08:12,936 --> 00:08:14,202
How could you know that?

124
00:08:14,237 --> 00:08:16,904
Oh, a lot of clocks were wrong.

125
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,908
And, uh, see, i've been taking
a statistically accurate

126
00:08:20,944 --> 00:08:22,476
sampling of the
whole school,

127
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:25,613
getting names, and addresses,
and phone numbers--

128
00:08:25,648 --> 00:08:27,915
you know, to see if it
all happened in one area.

129
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:29,917
May i see
that, please?

130
00:08:29,953 --> 00:08:31,986
Oh, yeah.

131
00:09:12,896 --> 00:09:14,829
Who did this?

132
00:09:23,072 --> 00:09:26,140
Do you know anything
about this, francis?

133
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:39,887
He was in your
science class?

134
00:09:39,923 --> 00:09:40,888
Not really in
the class,

135
00:09:40,924 --> 00:09:41,889
he was just sitting
on the shelf.

136
00:09:41,925 --> 00:09:42,890
He was what?

137
00:09:42,926 --> 00:09:44,892
Oh, look! There's
another one.

138
00:09:44,928 --> 00:09:47,128
How'd you get up there in
the first place, charlie?

139
00:09:47,163 --> 00:09:49,864
That is <i>so</i> weird.

140
00:09:52,936 --> 00:09:54,902
What if a helicopter
flew over so low that

141
00:09:54,938 --> 00:09:57,338
the dogs thought they
could catch it,

142
00:09:57,373 --> 00:09:59,006
and chased it right
up the roof?

143
00:09:59,042 --> 00:10:00,908
That's a logical
explanation, isn't it?

144
00:10:00,944 --> 00:10:02,176
Sure, jo.

145
00:10:03,112 --> 00:10:04,078
Hi, bert.

146
00:10:04,113 --> 00:10:05,880
Whatever.

147
00:10:05,915 --> 00:10:07,915
Have you got a
crush on bert?

148
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:08,916
No!

149
00:10:08,952 --> 00:10:09,917
Yes, you do!

150
00:10:09,953 --> 00:10:11,752
No, i don't!

151
00:10:11,787 --> 00:10:13,821
Well, he is
kinda cute.

152
00:10:13,857 --> 00:10:15,923
Well, you should see his room.

153
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:17,491
If you think dissecting
a frog is gross--

154
00:10:17,526 --> 00:10:20,761
i think it's really brave what he did for your little brother.

155
00:10:20,796 --> 00:10:22,930
All he had to do
was lie there.

156
00:10:22,966 --> 00:10:25,967
But i hear it really hurts when
they stick those needles in you.

157
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:28,936
It must be really great
to save someone's life.

158
00:10:28,972 --> 00:10:31,472
It was the doctors who
saved darwin's life.

159
00:10:32,475 --> 00:10:33,941
Well, you better
not tell bert

160
00:10:33,977 --> 00:10:35,910
anything about me
thinking he's cute.

161
00:10:35,945 --> 00:10:37,945
Yeah, right.
Like i'm gonna say anything to bert about anything.

162
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:38,946
Promise?

163
00:10:38,982 --> 00:10:40,514
I promise.

164
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:42,884
Cross your heart and hope to
die. Stick a needle in your eye.

165
00:10:43,987 --> 00:10:44,986
Grow up, joanne.

166
00:10:45,021 --> 00:10:46,988
Look, i gotta get to
swimming practice,

167
00:10:47,023 --> 00:10:48,389
but i'll see you tomorrow.

168
00:10:48,424 --> 00:10:49,957
Ok.

169
00:10:49,993 --> 00:10:51,959
Oh, are you trying out for
the high school team?

170
00:10:51,995 --> 00:10:54,061
They're all older than i am.

171
00:10:54,097 --> 00:10:55,963
Oh, it doesn't
matter in swimming,

172
00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:57,965
that just means you're
more streamline.

173
00:10:58,001 --> 00:10:58,966
Bye.

174
00:10:59,002 --> 00:10:59,934
Bye.

175
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,883
Are you following me?

176
00:11:16,953 --> 00:11:19,453
Yeah, i'm
talking to you.

177
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,357
You can see me?

178
00:11:23,393 --> 00:11:24,892
Well, yeah.

179
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,503
<i>Strange things were</i>
<i>happening that day.</i>

180
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:39,273
<i>All over middleburg.</i>

181
00:11:41,477 --> 00:11:45,012
<i>Someone put a little gelatin</i>
<i>in the school swimming pool.</i>

182
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:50,384
Help!

183
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,519
Hang on! I'll
get you out.

184
00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:54,855
Now, grab onto this.

185
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,959
<i>A colony of bees colonized</i>

186
00:11:57,994 --> 00:11:59,593
<i>the principal's office.</i>

187
00:12:06,902 --> 00:12:11,872
<i>School buses developed</i>
<i>unexplained leaks.</i>

188
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:19,280
<i>And then there was</i>

189
00:12:19,315 --> 00:12:21,048
<i>the graffiti.</i>

190
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:32,926
<i>Nobody knew who</i>
<i>was responsible.</i>

191
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:35,329
<i>Nobody knew who to blame.</i>

192
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:42,903
Aw, yuk.

193
00:12:47,676 --> 00:12:51,112
Aw, nanook--

194
00:12:51,147 --> 00:12:52,346
aaahhhhhh!

195
00:13:34,957 --> 00:13:35,889
Franny!

196
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,520
Why've you always got to
blame me for everything?

197
00:14:06,556 --> 00:14:07,888
It's called
inductive logic.

198
00:14:07,923 --> 00:14:09,890
Look, if you want everybody
to know you skipped a grade

199
00:14:09,925 --> 00:14:10,891
why don't you just
wear a sign?

200
00:14:10,926 --> 00:14:11,892
Bert?

201
00:14:11,927 --> 00:14:13,060
She's the one that started it.

202
00:14:13,096 --> 00:14:14,728
No one blaming anyone, bert,

203
00:14:14,763 --> 00:14:15,896
for anything.

204
00:14:15,931 --> 00:14:17,331
Of course not.

205
00:14:17,366 --> 00:14:19,900
It's just that studies of
various cultures show

206
00:14:19,935 --> 00:14:20,901
that pranks like these

207
00:14:20,936 --> 00:14:23,471
are usually the work
of adolescents.

208
00:14:23,506 --> 00:14:27,608
You know, i remember
when i was fifteen--

209
00:14:27,643 --> 00:14:29,910
you rolled a yard
with toilet paper.

210
00:14:29,945 --> 00:14:32,879
We were just discussing
whether any of the kids at school

211
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:34,615
are talking about anything.

212
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,917
You know, like setting
the clocks forward,

213
00:14:36,952 --> 00:14:38,885
or putting something in
the water at the pool.

214
00:14:40,055 --> 00:14:42,923
What happened to
all the gelatin?

215
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,925
Huh?

216
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,028
I was going to make my wiggly
fruit thing for dinner tonight.

217
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,296
Well, i didn't take it.

218
00:14:49,332 --> 00:14:51,898
Well, no one's saying
you did, bert.

219
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:54,935
Well, if it's not in the cabinet,
then somebody had to take it.

220
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,337
It's the only
logical conclusion.

221
00:14:59,975 --> 00:15:04,111
<i>Parents are always ready to</i>
<i>believe you've done something bad.</i>

222
00:15:04,147 --> 00:15:06,046
What?

223
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:09,850
<i>It's like they never forget they</i>
<i>had to change your diapers.</i>

224
00:15:12,155 --> 00:15:13,987
<i>But, at least your friends</i>
<i>have more faith in you.</i>

225
00:15:14,023 --> 00:15:15,889
Hi, jo.

226
00:15:15,924 --> 00:15:17,858
How could you do this?

227
00:15:18,927 --> 00:15:22,863
Jo loves bert! You promised!

228
00:15:25,434 --> 00:15:26,900
Jo, i didn't do this.

229
00:15:26,935 --> 00:15:29,870
Get real, francis!

230
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:32,806
Jo! Joanne!

231
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:34,041
Forget it!

232
00:15:58,801 --> 00:16:00,867
<i>If i thought it was</i>
<i>strange at home,</i>

233
00:16:00,903 --> 00:16:02,002
<i>school was even stranger.</i>

234
00:16:59,962 --> 00:17:02,829
I'm telling you, she's
the one who did it.

235
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:06,867
Is there something
interesting about my locker?

236
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:09,436
Why is yours the only
one without a "b" on it?

237
00:17:09,472 --> 00:17:11,872
Maybe she's the
one who did it.

238
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:13,874
Grow up, people.

239
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:16,310
Just because they
skipped my locker

240
00:17:16,345 --> 00:17:17,844
it doesn't mean i had
anything to do with--

241
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:20,080
see, it is her.

242
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:41,902
Hey, did you really egg
creepy kepler's car?

243
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:42,903
Who told you that?

244
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:44,004
That's what everybody says.

245
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,906
They said you did
the lockers too.

246
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:46,907
I think that's
really cool.

247
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:48,909
It's not cool,
it's vandalism.

248
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:50,678
What does "b" stand for?

249
00:17:50,713 --> 00:17:52,913
You know,
i did not put a "b" on all the lockers!

250
00:17:52,948 --> 00:17:53,914
Well, who did then?

251
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:55,882
I--

252
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,191
i'm gonna find out.

253
00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:12,899
Aren't ya gonna run
away this time?

254
00:18:12,935 --> 00:18:14,501
I didn't really run away.

255
00:18:14,537 --> 00:18:15,836
Yes. You did!

256
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:18,872
I just needed some space
to evaluate the situation.

257
00:18:18,907 --> 00:18:21,775
I didn't know you could see me.

258
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:23,210
Why wouldn't i be
able to see you?

259
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,547
Nobody else can.

260
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,515
Yeah, right.

261
00:18:28,551 --> 00:18:30,150
All right.

262
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,854
Ooohh! Yeaaahh! Ooow!

263
00:18:38,427 --> 00:18:39,893
Well, that's
stealing, you know?

264
00:18:39,928 --> 00:18:40,994
He knows he shouldn't
eat this stuff.

265
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:42,963
It makes his
face break out.

266
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:46,900
Well, what's your
name, anyway?

267
00:18:46,935 --> 00:18:48,902
Houdini.

268
00:18:48,937 --> 00:18:50,804
Larry houdini.

269
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,907
Oh, i guess you're almost named after harry houdini?

270
00:18:53,942 --> 00:18:55,909
That-that's really funny.

271
00:18:55,944 --> 00:18:59,279
It's better than being named after <i>francis bacon.</i>

272
00:18:59,314 --> 00:19:00,848
I don't like bacon.

273
00:19:00,883 --> 00:19:01,849
Well--

274
00:19:01,884 --> 00:19:04,618
houdini's not even
a <i>real</i> name.

275
00:19:04,653 --> 00:19:07,153
I'm not a real person.

276
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:08,856
I'm...

277
00:19:08,891 --> 00:19:10,824
an imaginary friend.

278
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,859
Thank you very much!
Thank you very much!

279
00:19:11,894 --> 00:19:13,827
Yeah! Yeah! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

280
00:19:13,863 --> 00:19:16,697
Well, that's really cute, but i
do not have an imaginary friend.

281
00:19:16,732 --> 00:19:20,634
Did i say i was <i>your</i>
imaginary friend?

282
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:23,504
I don't think so,
miss francis.

283
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:24,872
Well,

284
00:19:24,907 --> 00:19:27,040
if you're not my friend,

285
00:19:27,075 --> 00:19:29,175
then why are you
following me around?

286
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:32,045
Are you sure i'm
following you?

287
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,849
Maybe you're just imagining.

288
00:19:38,487 --> 00:19:39,887
No!

289
00:19:39,922 --> 00:19:40,888
Seriously, fran, do you
mind if i call you fran?

290
00:19:40,923 --> 00:19:42,122
Yeah, actually i do.

291
00:19:42,157 --> 00:19:43,891
I think i must have been
sent here to help you.

292
00:19:43,926 --> 00:19:45,893
That's probably
why you can see me.

293
00:19:45,928 --> 00:19:47,994
Oh, you know, i
don't need any help,

294
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,898
real or imaginary.

295
00:19:50,933 --> 00:19:53,400
Oh, contraire.

296
00:19:53,436 --> 00:19:55,602
There's something very peculiar

297
00:19:55,638 --> 00:19:57,671
going down in this burg, watson.

298
00:19:57,706 --> 00:19:59,907
And it looks to me like...

299
00:19:59,942 --> 00:20:01,909
you're in the middle of it.

300
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:03,911
Look, i don't care
what they said,

301
00:20:03,946 --> 00:20:05,913
but i did <i>not</i> egg
mr. Kepler's car.

302
00:20:05,948 --> 00:20:07,748
I know you didn't.

303
00:20:07,783 --> 00:20:08,749
Ok.

304
00:20:08,784 --> 00:20:10,651
I know who did.

305
00:20:11,954 --> 00:20:13,320
It was the boogeyman.

306
00:20:15,658 --> 00:20:17,925
The boogeyman?

307
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,893
Um-hmm. And i think he's
got it in for you, fran.

308
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:21,294
I think you're being...

309
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,896
framed.

310
00:20:28,136 --> 00:20:30,838
Excuse me!

311
00:20:30,873 --> 00:20:31,972
I'm-i'm really sorry.

312
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:35,576
Umm, does anybody know
who this guy is?

313
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:36,944
What is she talking about?

314
00:20:36,979 --> 00:20:40,514
He says his name is
larry houdini.

315
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:43,450
Does anybody know
who he really is?

316
00:20:52,427 --> 00:20:55,963
<i>Francis mccausland.</i>
<i>To the office please.</i>

317
00:20:55,998 --> 00:20:59,967
<i>Francis mccausland.</i>
<i>To the office.</i>

318
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,907
I see your middle name is bacon.

319
00:21:06,942 --> 00:21:10,878
That is bacon with
a "b", correct?

320
00:21:10,913 --> 00:21:13,480
Is there a bacon without a "b"?

321
00:21:13,516 --> 00:21:16,917
Francis, it has been suggested

322
00:21:16,952 --> 00:21:19,019
that you might know something

323
00:21:19,054 --> 00:21:21,922
about the unusual events
that have been happening

324
00:21:21,957 --> 00:21:23,557
the past few days.

325
00:21:23,592 --> 00:21:25,926
We have reason to
believe there was a plan

326
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:27,928
among a large
number of students

327
00:21:27,963 --> 00:21:30,931
to set clocks to
the wrong time

328
00:21:30,966 --> 00:21:32,298
as a sort of mass prank.

329
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:34,902
<i>You</i> had that list of students you were checking with

330
00:21:34,937 --> 00:21:36,770
to make sure they set their clocks forward.

331
00:21:36,805 --> 00:21:38,304
What?

332
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,108
Back.
You set them <i>back</i> to make the alarms go off earlier.

333
00:21:42,144 --> 00:21:43,176
You set them forward.

334
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:45,946
It's like daylight savings time.

335
00:21:45,981 --> 00:21:46,947
Fall back.
Spring forward.

336
00:21:46,982 --> 00:21:48,582
No. Fall forwards.
Spring back.

337
00:21:48,617 --> 00:21:50,250
Can we forget
about the clocks...

338
00:21:50,285 --> 00:21:51,952
for a moment?

339
00:21:51,987 --> 00:21:52,953
Spring forward.

340
00:21:52,988 --> 00:21:55,956
Francis, do you
have any knowledge

341
00:21:55,991 --> 00:21:57,658
about mr. Kepler's car
being vandalized?

342
00:21:57,693 --> 00:21:58,959
No!

343
00:21:58,994 --> 00:22:00,861
Or about the graffiti
on the lockers?

344
00:22:00,896 --> 00:22:01,895
No!

345
00:22:01,931 --> 00:22:03,897
Don't forget the gelatin
in the swimming pool.

346
00:22:03,933 --> 00:22:04,898
No!

347
00:22:04,934 --> 00:22:06,266
How do you
feel, francis,

348
00:22:06,301 --> 00:22:08,902
about all
these things?

349
00:22:08,938 --> 00:22:12,305
Do you have
any insights?

350
00:22:15,644 --> 00:22:18,278
Yes. Yes, actually i do.

351
00:22:18,313 --> 00:22:20,146
There's this boy...

352
00:22:20,182 --> 00:22:23,917
and he's been
following me around.

353
00:22:23,953 --> 00:22:25,919
Well, he's really weird.

354
00:22:25,955 --> 00:22:28,254
He said his name
was larry houdini.

355
00:22:32,194 --> 00:22:35,228
Well, he said a lot
of silly things.

356
00:22:35,263 --> 00:22:38,899
Did he say he knew who
was behind the pranks?

357
00:22:39,969 --> 00:22:42,335
Well, actually--

358
00:22:43,973 --> 00:22:45,939
well, there he is!
He's right there!

359
00:22:45,975 --> 00:22:47,841
Hey!

360
00:22:47,876 --> 00:22:49,375
Come here, you!

361
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:50,543
Francis.

362
00:22:53,983 --> 00:22:54,948
Francis!

363
00:22:54,984 --> 00:22:57,951
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

364
00:22:57,987 --> 00:23:00,721
Ya! Ya! Ya! Ya! Ya!

365
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:03,323
Hey! You! Come here!

366
00:23:03,358 --> 00:23:06,326
Houdini kid, come here!

367
00:23:06,361 --> 00:23:07,327
Hey! What's
with her?

368
00:23:07,362 --> 00:23:08,428
Come back here!

369
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:12,766
Quick! In here!

370
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,905
Get in the bass drum.

371
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:21,908
As a hiding place,
you can't beat it!

372
00:23:21,944 --> 00:23:23,910
I'm not trying to
hide. I'm chasing you.

373
00:23:23,946 --> 00:23:25,912
Fran, fran, fran.

374
00:23:25,948 --> 00:23:27,914
You're making a
big mistake, fran.

375
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,816
And i was really sent
here to help you.

376
00:23:29,852 --> 00:23:31,818
Yeah, who sent you?

377
00:23:31,854 --> 00:23:33,920
Do you ever hear a little
voice inside you head,

378
00:23:33,956 --> 00:23:34,921
telling you you
should do something?

379
00:23:34,957 --> 00:23:35,922
Actually, no.

380
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:39,926
Well, i did. And <i>he</i> told me

381
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:42,929
to come to beautiful
downtown middleburg.

382
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:44,931
What you heard was
just disassociation

383
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:46,933
between the two
sides of your...

384
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:47,934
alleged brain.

385
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,770
No, no, no. It's
the same guy

386
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:52,039
that sings those stupid songs
you can't get out of your head.

387
00:23:52,074 --> 00:23:53,974
No. That's
barry manilow.

388
00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:55,042
Francis!

389
00:23:55,077 --> 00:23:56,143
In here!

390
00:23:57,813 --> 00:23:59,512
He's in here!

391
00:23:59,548 --> 00:24:00,881
See you get out of
this one, houdini.

392
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:03,850
Fran, fran, fran.

393
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,887
There he is. Larry houdini.

394
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:16,997
I think this joke has gone on long enough, francis.

395
00:24:17,032 --> 00:24:18,899
What are you
talking about?

396
00:24:18,934 --> 00:24:20,901
He's right here. He's
playing a saxophone.

397
00:24:20,936 --> 00:24:22,869
He's moon-walking.

398
00:24:26,641 --> 00:24:28,909
I'm going to have to
call your parents.

399
00:24:28,944 --> 00:24:29,910
Why are you doing
this to me?

400
00:24:29,945 --> 00:24:33,914
Why are you pretending
that you can't--

401
00:24:33,949 --> 00:24:36,817
see him?

402
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:38,919
Would you like to
lie down, francis?

403
00:24:42,457 --> 00:24:43,423
Francis?

404
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:44,891
Francis! Oh!

405
00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:04,878
Would you say that francis
is unusually rebellious?

406
00:25:04,913 --> 00:25:07,180
Oh, no. Not at all.

407
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:10,316
Francis has always been
very mature for her age.

408
00:25:10,352 --> 00:25:12,652
Very, very
well adjusted.

409
00:25:12,687 --> 00:25:13,887
Very grown up.

410
00:25:13,922 --> 00:25:16,890
Starting high school
can be traumatic.

411
00:25:16,925 --> 00:25:19,259
Especially if she
skipped a grade.

412
00:25:19,294 --> 00:25:22,896
I understand that her younger
brother had leukemia.

413
00:25:22,931 --> 00:25:25,899
And it says here
that he was given

414
00:25:25,934 --> 00:25:28,601
bone marrow transplants
from his sibling.

415
00:25:28,637 --> 00:25:31,905
Well, yes. That's true.

416
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,908
Ah, but darwin is in remission.

417
00:25:34,943 --> 00:25:37,811
The doctors say there's every
hope for a complete cure.

418
00:25:37,846 --> 00:25:38,912
Oh.

419
00:25:38,947 --> 00:25:41,214
I've been developing
a theory

420
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,916
that francis is acting out,

421
00:25:42,951 --> 00:25:46,920
oh, repressed anger at having
to donate her bone marrow

422
00:25:46,955 --> 00:25:48,021
to save her brother.

423
00:25:48,056 --> 00:25:51,091
Well, that's interesting.

424
00:25:51,126 --> 00:25:53,927
However it was our elder son,

425
00:25:53,962 --> 00:25:56,963
bert, albert,

426
00:25:56,999 --> 00:25:58,698
who was the donor.

427
00:25:58,733 --> 00:26:00,500
So...?

428
00:26:00,535 --> 00:26:04,871
Well, it was
just a theory.

429
00:26:04,907 --> 00:26:05,839
I see.

430
00:26:30,933 --> 00:26:32,699
Oh.

431
00:26:38,941 --> 00:26:41,908
Can franny come out to play?

432
00:26:47,782 --> 00:26:48,915
Aaahhhh!

433
00:26:48,951 --> 00:26:50,917
Francis!

434
00:26:50,953 --> 00:26:53,220
How do you
feel, francis?

435
00:26:53,255 --> 00:26:54,921
Ok.

436
00:26:54,957 --> 00:26:56,890
I guess.

437
00:26:56,925 --> 00:26:59,492
Oh, i am sure that there
is a logical explanation

438
00:26:59,527 --> 00:27:01,561
for everything that's
been going on.

439
00:27:01,596 --> 00:27:02,863
I know that you are
far too mature

440
00:27:02,898 --> 00:27:06,299
to be playing childish
pranks on people.

441
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:09,102
And you still think it
was this boy, larry,

442
00:27:09,137 --> 00:27:11,104
who put the gelatin in
the swimming pool,

443
00:27:11,139 --> 00:27:15,108
and threw the eggs
on mr. Kepler's car?

444
00:27:15,143 --> 00:27:17,610
Eggs?

445
00:27:18,914 --> 00:27:23,583
I'm sure it is all simply a
misunderstanding, honey,

446
00:27:23,618 --> 00:27:27,888
but francis, i was just
thinking about something

447
00:27:27,923 --> 00:27:29,589
ms. Readle said.

448
00:27:29,624 --> 00:27:31,992
You know, about
repressed anger.

449
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:33,726
Oh, mom, no!

450
00:27:33,762 --> 00:27:34,895
Is there anything your father and i could possibly--

451
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:37,898
please, please let's not
get freudian, ok?

452
00:27:37,933 --> 00:27:40,901
This is not some
kind of adolescent--

453
00:27:40,936 --> 00:27:41,868
thing.

454
00:27:43,571 --> 00:27:44,871
Well, honey...?

455
00:27:46,841 --> 00:27:48,041
I didn't do it!

456
00:27:50,946 --> 00:27:55,148
She ran into her room like she
was still just a little child.

457
00:27:55,183 --> 00:27:58,919
Oh, what if she's not emotionally
mature enough to start high school?

458
00:27:58,954 --> 00:28:02,855
Oh, come on.
We have thought all the way through this.

459
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:06,026
I know, but what if
we made a mistake?

460
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:07,894
Well, maybe she's
unhappy, michael.

461
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,562
Maybe she's blaming us.

462
00:28:09,597 --> 00:28:12,865
Oh! Oh!
So you think our daughter

463
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:15,168
is expressing her
resentment towards us

464
00:28:15,203 --> 00:28:19,239
by writing the letter "b"
all through the town.

465
00:28:19,274 --> 00:28:21,874
Let's be the adults
here, michael, shall we?

466
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:26,879
No. I mean, obviously she's
not doing everything alone.

467
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:28,881
Well, obviously.

468
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:30,883
But if she is unhappy,

469
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:32,585
that could make her vulnerable,

470
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,721
and maybe she got involved in...

471
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:40,093
some kind of--oh, i
don't know, some--

472
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:47,900
mind control.

473
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:49,902
You know, she mentioned
being hypnotized

474
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:51,804
in the car on the way home.

475
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,007
And there are incidents of mass hypnosis

476
00:28:54,042 --> 00:28:55,908
that have occurred
all over the world.

477
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:57,910
What <i>if</i>

478
00:28:57,946 --> 00:29:01,081
someone is controlling
the minds of children

479
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:02,849
all over middleburg?

480
00:29:02,884 --> 00:29:05,818
Telling them to egg cars,
and set clocks back--

481
00:29:05,854 --> 00:29:09,155
so you're saying that someone
is coming into this house

482
00:29:09,191 --> 00:29:11,858
to control our
children's minds?

483
00:29:11,893 --> 00:29:13,860
How could
they do that?

484
00:29:13,895 --> 00:29:15,862
<i>So remember, my friends, when</i>
<i>you are ready to make--</i>

485
00:29:15,897 --> 00:29:18,098
we are having an important discussion here, bert!

486
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:20,100
About francis.

487
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:22,869
What?
You guys think she's the one doing all that stuff?

488
00:29:22,904 --> 00:29:24,437
That's what everybody
at school says.

489
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:26,839
She's supposed to be, like,
the ringleader or something.

490
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:28,508
To break this accursed
spell, hmm?

491
00:29:28,543 --> 00:29:30,910
Be mass hypnosis.otta

492
00:29:30,945 --> 00:29:34,280
be mass hypnosis.otta

493
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:37,650
it's the only
possible explanation.

494
00:29:52,967 --> 00:29:54,234
Aaaah!

495
00:29:54,269 --> 00:29:55,935
Darwin!

496
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:58,938
Are you sure there isn't
really a boogyman?

497
00:29:58,973 --> 00:29:59,972
What?

498
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:01,941
Some kids at the
park said there is.

499
00:30:01,976 --> 00:30:04,377
But if you pull the covers
over your head at night,

500
00:30:04,413 --> 00:30:05,945
the boogeyman
can't get you.

501
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,948
Darwin, the boogeyman
is just something

502
00:30:08,983 --> 00:30:10,950
that somebody made
up to scare children.

503
00:30:10,985 --> 00:30:14,120
You know, somebody older and wiser
needs to tell those kids the truth.

504
00:30:14,156 --> 00:30:17,057
It was a big boy who told
them about the boogeyman.

505
00:30:17,092 --> 00:30:19,959
Well, he should be ashamed for
scaring children like that.

506
00:30:19,994 --> 00:30:22,929
They said his name was larry.

507
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,166
Hey! Hey, darwin!

508
00:30:27,102 --> 00:30:28,968
What did he
look like?

509
00:30:29,003 --> 00:30:32,205
The guy who told them
about the boogeyman.

510
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,974
I don't know. They said he
was playing basketball.

511
00:30:35,009 --> 00:30:36,943
But i couldn't see him.

512
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:50,623
Come on. Give
me the ball.

513
00:30:50,658 --> 00:30:51,991
Give me the ball!
Give me the ball!

514
00:30:52,026 --> 00:30:52,992
Wooowwww!

515
00:30:53,027 --> 00:30:54,026
Woooowwwowww!

516
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:55,027
And he scores!

517
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:56,229
Hyyyeeee ya!

518
00:30:56,264 --> 00:30:59,165
Woowooooo!

519
00:30:59,201 --> 00:31:01,101
You missed the shot.

520
00:31:01,136 --> 00:31:03,936
What are you? The referee?

521
00:31:03,972 --> 00:31:05,938
Games over,
larry houdini.

522
00:31:05,974 --> 00:31:06,939
Are you mad
about somethin'?

523
00:31:06,975 --> 00:31:08,941
Yeah! Actually
i'm furious!

524
00:31:08,977 --> 00:31:12,044
You had me thinkin' i was
seeing things, or something.

525
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,581
For telling me you're some
kind of imaginary person.

526
00:31:14,616 --> 00:31:15,948
Fran! Get it right.

527
00:31:15,984 --> 00:31:17,950
Well, all you really
did was just hypnotize

528
00:31:17,986 --> 00:31:18,951
the principal
and ms. Readle

529
00:31:18,987 --> 00:31:20,786
to make them think that
they couldn't see you.

530
00:31:20,822 --> 00:31:21,787
What?

531
00:31:21,823 --> 00:31:22,955
Yeah.

532
00:31:22,991 --> 00:31:24,957
Girl! I don't know how
to hypnotize people.

533
00:31:24,993 --> 00:31:28,628
I can do a magic trick.

534
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,966
Here you go, fran.

535
00:31:34,002 --> 00:31:35,268
You know, if you're not
for real then why--

536
00:31:35,303 --> 00:31:36,969
why could the kids
in the park see you?

537
00:31:37,005 --> 00:31:39,272
Those were little
kids, fran.

538
00:31:39,307 --> 00:31:40,973
They can see
anything they want.

539
00:31:41,009 --> 00:31:45,978
Just like i see
these monkey bars.

540
00:31:50,985 --> 00:31:52,985
You know, i want you
to tell my parents,

541
00:31:53,021 --> 00:31:54,987
and the principal,

542
00:31:55,023 --> 00:31:55,988
and ms. Readle...

543
00:31:56,024 --> 00:31:58,090
are you listening to me?

544
00:31:58,126 --> 00:31:59,091
Larry?

545
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:01,927
They can't see me, fran. Ok?

[Continues making
monkey noises ñ

00:32:08,002 --> 00:32:10,637
are you the one who's been
causing' all the weird stuff

548
00:32:10,672 --> 00:32:11,937
that's happening around here?

549
00:32:11,973 --> 00:32:15,642
Yeah, like the graffiti,
and the vandalism,

550
00:32:15,677 --> 00:32:16,942
and the dogs?

551
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:18,944
Why are you doing
this to me?

552
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,380
I told you.

553
00:32:20,415 --> 00:32:22,515
The guy in my head.
He sent me here.

554
00:32:22,551 --> 00:32:23,916
You don't listen.

555
00:32:24,986 --> 00:32:27,720
I get it. I get it.
You're trying to get me into trouble.

556
00:32:27,755 --> 00:32:28,954
You're trying to blame
everything on me.

557
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,955
Shhhhh.

558
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:30,956
What?
Shhhhhh.

559
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:31,957
What?

560
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:33,526
Can you hear 'em?

561
00:32:33,562 --> 00:32:34,960
No! I don't hear voices!

562
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:39,699
I just see things.

563
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,571
Have you seen this one yet?

564
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:47,674
Check it out, fran.
Pretty cool, huh?

565
00:32:47,709 --> 00:32:49,175
Weeeeee!

00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,880
Ahh.

00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:56,916
Do you have a
library card?

568
00:32:58,019 --> 00:32:58,951

said i needed a book.

bright in here?

Some people, they
like to read in here.

Go figure.

593
00:33:57,011 --> 00:33:58,978
What's with
your eyes?

594
00:33:59,013 --> 00:34:00,913
Ok. It's not that
bright in here.

you mean <i>not</i> for real.

He did.

645
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:44,510
He did.

646
00:36:44,546 --> 00:36:47,914
Do not touch the audio
visual equipment.

So, who wants to
hear the story...

649
00:37:07,635 --> 00:37:10,135
...about the boogeyman?

650
00:37:10,171 --> 00:37:13,405
Oh, i'm getting scared
just thinking about it.

651
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:15,808
Oh, hi, francis. How you doin'?

652
00:37:15,844 --> 00:37:16,809
Anyway,

653
00:37:16,845 --> 00:37:19,078
the boogeyman is a very bad man.

654
00:37:19,113 --> 00:37:21,914
So, if he ever tries to
come into your home,

655
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,916
at night, into your room,

656
00:37:23,952 --> 00:37:25,918
make sure you pull the
covers over your head.

657
00:37:25,954 --> 00:37:27,920
That way he can't get you.

658
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:33,392
I think i'd like
to check this out.

659
00:37:35,964 --> 00:37:37,930
Oh! This is it!
This is it!

to bust your boogey.

00:37:43,137 --> 00:37:44,937
You know, you could
be an astronaut

662
00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:48,941
from a galaxy
far, far away.

663
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:50,943
And you've got this neural thing in your head

664
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:52,945
that keeps people
from seeing you.

665
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:55,915
Ok.
Although it doesn't work on really small children.

666
00:37:57,351 --> 00:37:59,585
You know, what if that
voice in your head,

667
00:37:59,621 --> 00:38:00,887
what if it's some
kind of transmission

668
00:38:00,922 --> 00:38:02,388
from a mother ship?

669
00:38:02,423 --> 00:38:05,525
Man, if we had a
thermo-nuclear device

670
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,126
that boogeyman
would be toast!

671
00:38:07,161 --> 00:38:08,895
No! What if
the boogeyman

672
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:11,898
was really a creature from a distant planet?

673
00:38:11,933 --> 00:38:13,332
He comes from
under your bed.

674
00:38:13,367 --> 00:38:14,333
What?

675
00:38:14,368 --> 00:38:15,902
It says it right here.

676
00:38:15,937 --> 00:38:17,904
The boogeyman lives
under your bed.

677
00:38:17,939 --> 00:38:18,971
It doesn't say
which bed,

678
00:38:19,007 --> 00:38:20,907
but i figure if he's trying to ruin your life,

679
00:38:20,942 --> 00:38:22,875
it must be
under <i>your</i> bed.

680
00:38:24,111 --> 00:38:25,912
Well, there's nothing living under my bed.

681
00:38:25,947 --> 00:38:26,913
Oh, yeah, francis?

682
00:38:26,948 --> 00:38:27,914
Yeah.

683
00:38:27,949 --> 00:38:29,982
Have you
looked lately?

684
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,921
Well, let's just go look right now.

685
00:38:34,956 --> 00:38:35,888
All righty,
then.

686
00:38:35,924 --> 00:38:36,856
Ok.

687
00:38:38,927 --> 00:38:40,092
Well, are you coming or--

688
00:38:43,932 --> 00:38:45,865
what?

689
00:38:52,106 --> 00:38:53,906
Where have you
been, francis?

690
00:38:53,942 --> 00:38:55,541
Don't, michael.

691
00:38:55,577 --> 00:38:56,909
I just went to
the library.

692
00:38:56,945 --> 00:39:00,613
You know you're not supposed
to go out without telling us first.

693
00:39:00,648 --> 00:39:02,848
Ok. I'm sorry.
I guess i forgot.

694
00:39:02,884 --> 00:39:04,483
It's all
right, francis.

695
00:39:04,518 --> 00:39:06,852
We're not angry.
We're just very worried about you.

696
00:39:06,888 --> 00:39:08,854
Can i go to
my room now?

697
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,856
Actually, we need
to talk, francis.

698
00:39:10,892 --> 00:39:11,857
Yes, you may go.

699
00:39:11,893 --> 00:39:14,860
But just keep us informed next time, ok?

700
00:39:14,896 --> 00:39:16,862
Ok.

701
00:39:16,898 --> 00:39:18,864
Don't you want to know what's going on with her?

702
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,633
Well, of course i do!

703
00:39:20,668 --> 00:39:22,101
But we can't pressure
her, michael.

704
00:39:22,136 --> 00:39:23,168
She needs her space.

705
00:39:23,204 --> 00:39:25,037
She needs
professional help!

706
00:39:25,073 --> 00:39:26,872
Sshhhh!

707
00:39:26,908 --> 00:39:29,875
I am going to e-mail
that guidance counselor,

708
00:39:29,911 --> 00:39:31,243
ms. Readle.

709
00:39:31,278 --> 00:39:33,879
I'm going to invite her
over to dinner tomorrow.

710
00:39:33,915 --> 00:39:35,881
She has experience
dealing with

711
00:39:35,917 --> 00:39:37,449
problems like this.

712
00:39:37,485 --> 00:39:40,753
Besides, i have that
roast i need to cook.

713
00:40:24,966 --> 00:40:25,931
Hey!

714
00:40:27,969 --> 00:40:28,934
Larry!

715
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:30,836
He's not under there...

716
00:40:30,872 --> 00:40:31,904
...now.

717
00:40:33,741 --> 00:40:36,776
Ok. It says here there's
this thing called temporalfuge

718
00:40:36,811 --> 00:40:38,443
that can make a
boogeyman harmless.

719
00:40:38,479 --> 00:40:40,646
You've got your
feet on my bed!

720
00:40:40,682 --> 00:40:42,948
Aw, man!
I think i can make one of these temporalfuge things.

721
00:40:42,984 --> 00:40:44,383
Where do you get
your clothes?

722
00:40:44,418 --> 00:40:46,185
Well, i swear, it's got the
instructions and everything!

723
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,186
Look at this!

724
00:40:47,221 --> 00:40:50,322
Have you lost your marbles?

725
00:40:50,357 --> 00:40:51,857
Darwin?

726
00:40:51,893 --> 00:40:55,460
Found 'em on the floor.
They're not bert's.

727
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:57,063
Hey, man! Don't you
recognize me?

728
00:40:57,098 --> 00:40:58,064
How do you
know darwin?

729
00:40:58,099 --> 00:40:59,198
He said they
weren't his.

730
00:40:59,233 --> 00:41:00,265
It's me!

731
00:41:00,301 --> 00:41:01,901
Larry?

732
00:41:01,936 --> 00:41:03,268
Are they yours?

733
00:41:03,304 --> 00:41:05,671
Do you see anybody else in here?

734
00:41:05,707 --> 00:41:07,907
You don't have to
be snotty about it.

735
00:41:07,942 --> 00:41:10,710
I don't want your ol'
marbles, anyway.

736
00:41:11,846 --> 00:41:13,813
Oh, wait. Don't leave, darwin.
Darwin?

737
00:41:13,848 --> 00:41:17,883
Darwin? Why won't you be
my friend anymore?

738
00:41:18,953 --> 00:41:20,920
You were darwin's
imaginary friend?

739
00:41:20,955 --> 00:41:22,154
I didn't know that
was your brother.

740
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,923
Darwin, pull the
covers over your head,

741
00:41:23,958 --> 00:41:25,991
so you'll be safe. Ok?

742
00:41:27,261 --> 00:41:29,929
He doesn't even
know i exist!

743
00:41:29,964 --> 00:41:33,933
Well, he doesn't believe in things like imaginary friends.

744
00:41:33,968 --> 00:41:36,936
I can't believe i'm
having this conversation.

745
00:41:36,971 --> 00:41:39,772
You're not really an
imaginary friend.

746
00:41:39,807 --> 00:41:42,307
I don't understand why he
doesn't believe in me anymore.

747
00:41:42,343 --> 00:41:44,443
Oh, well, look. I told
him a long time ago

748
00:41:44,478 --> 00:41:47,146
that it was childish to
believe in things like that.

749
00:41:50,985 --> 00:41:52,918
You did it.

750
00:41:54,288 --> 00:41:55,955
You're the reason
why he can't see me!

751
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,990
You told darwin to
stop believing in me.

752
00:41:58,025 --> 00:42:00,292
What's wrong
with your eyes?

753
00:42:03,164 --> 00:42:05,898
I must be allergic to
something. I don't know.

754
00:42:05,933 --> 00:42:07,900
Allergies don't make
your eyes look like that.

755
00:42:07,935 --> 00:42:10,535
You know what, fran, you just
know everything. Don't you?

756
00:42:10,571 --> 00:42:12,905
That's why--that's why you told
darwin to stop believing in me.

757
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,907
To show him you knew
more than he did.

758
00:42:14,942 --> 00:42:18,911
No! He needs to believe in his doctors.
Ok?

759
00:42:18,946 --> 00:42:20,646
Something real.

760
00:42:21,949 --> 00:42:25,918
That's how you
stop being afraid.

761
00:42:25,953 --> 00:42:27,920
You grow up and...

762
00:42:27,955 --> 00:42:30,689
face reality.

763
00:42:30,724 --> 00:42:31,924
And i had to
help him do that.

764
00:42:31,959 --> 00:42:33,558
You wanted to help him?

765
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:35,928
Then why didn't you give him
some of your bone marrow? Huh?

766
00:42:35,963 --> 00:42:37,930
I wanted to help him
but the doctors said

767
00:42:37,965 --> 00:42:39,932
bert was the only
one who could do it.

768
00:42:39,967 --> 00:42:41,566
I bet that was a relief.

769
00:42:41,602 --> 00:42:42,902
No! I wanted to do it!

770
00:42:42,937 --> 00:42:43,969
Safe!

771
00:42:44,005 --> 00:42:45,504
Larry?

772
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:47,940
No! Don't pretend with me, fran!

773
00:42:47,975 --> 00:42:49,909
I know all about pretending.

774
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,082
Larry?

775
00:44:00,481 --> 00:44:03,849
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heehhhh.

776
00:44:31,946 --> 00:44:32,878
Fran?

777
00:44:34,315 --> 00:44:37,582
The boogeyman
is on the roof.

778
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,920
A fireman now?

779
00:44:40,955 --> 00:44:42,988
You remind me of
darwin's action figures.

780
00:44:44,792 --> 00:44:45,925
Well, i don't
see anybody.

781
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,927
Just all these
christmas lights.

782
00:44:47,962 --> 00:44:50,930
There is no boogeyman
on the roof. Ok?

783
00:44:50,965 --> 00:44:52,798
I think you're making
the whole thing up.

784
00:44:54,969 --> 00:44:57,369
Hold this for me.
I'm going up.

785
00:44:57,405 --> 00:44:58,503
Wait. Wait. What are
you going to do?

786
00:44:58,539 --> 00:44:59,704
I don't know.

787
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,974
Ok? I don't know.

788
00:45:02,009 --> 00:45:03,875
I guess i'll use
my imagination.

789
00:45:03,911 --> 00:45:04,977
Try using a ladder. Ok?

790
00:45:05,012 --> 00:45:05,978
There's one in
the garage.

791
00:45:06,013 --> 00:45:07,079
Larry?

792
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:10,849
Larry?

793
00:45:14,922 --> 00:45:16,888
Larry?

794
00:45:16,924 --> 00:45:17,889
Larry?!

795
00:45:17,925 --> 00:45:19,858
Ssshhhhh!

796
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,899
Larry?

797
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,867
Larry?

798
00:45:59,967 --> 00:46:02,868
Rah!

799
00:46:02,903 --> 00:46:04,269
Ha ha ha ha ha haaaa!

800
00:46:08,075 --> 00:46:09,841
Got you!

801
00:46:10,911 --> 00:46:12,878
Aaaahhhh!

802
00:46:12,913 --> 00:46:13,879
Ha ha ha ha!

803
00:46:13,914 --> 00:46:15,881
Aaahhhhh!

804
00:46:15,916 --> 00:46:17,516
Whoooooa!

805
00:46:20,287 --> 00:46:22,388
It's nice of you
to hang around,

806
00:46:22,423 --> 00:46:25,590
but you'd be safer
on the ground.

807
00:46:25,626 --> 00:46:28,727
Whooo whooo whooo ha ha haaa!

808
00:46:28,762 --> 00:46:30,896
Oh, eyes are
kinda scarey.

809
00:46:30,931 --> 00:46:33,065
Don't ya think
so, larry?

810
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,233
Do you see him, fran?!

811
00:46:35,169 --> 00:46:36,301
Franny.

812
00:46:38,305 --> 00:46:41,907
It won't be long
until she can see

813
00:46:41,942 --> 00:46:44,543
a boogey just like me.

814
00:46:44,578 --> 00:46:45,911
Larry?

815
00:46:45,946 --> 00:46:47,913
Do you see him, fran?!

816
00:46:47,948 --> 00:46:49,881
Do you see him?!

817
00:46:51,185 --> 00:46:54,920
And you'll see that
you boogey too.

818
00:46:54,955 --> 00:46:57,756
Inside of the mirror,

819
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,891
it's you.

820
00:47:05,899 --> 00:47:07,866
Fran!

821
00:47:07,901 --> 00:47:10,035
Whoa!

822
00:47:10,071 --> 00:47:11,836
Whooaaa!

823
00:47:13,941 --> 00:47:15,874
Aaahhhh!

824
00:47:15,909 --> 00:47:17,576
Aaahhhhh!

825
00:47:17,611 --> 00:47:18,843
What was that?

826
00:47:21,014 --> 00:47:21,980
Ohhh!

827
00:47:22,015 --> 00:47:24,983
Look around and you will see

828
00:47:25,018 --> 00:47:28,853
that blackout starts with "b".

829
00:47:35,096 --> 00:47:36,728
What's this?

830
00:47:36,763 --> 00:47:37,862
What's with
the lights?

831
00:47:40,033 --> 00:47:41,766
Francis?

832
00:47:42,703 --> 00:47:44,736
What?

833
00:47:44,771 --> 00:47:46,405
Please.

834
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,673
Ahh, ahhh...

835
00:47:48,709 --> 00:47:49,674
what?

836
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:52,978
Ahhh... aahhh...

837
00:48:01,888 --> 00:48:03,822
hey, mike!
What's up with this?

838
00:48:03,857 --> 00:48:04,856
There he is!

839
00:48:04,891 --> 00:48:07,859
Mr. Mccausland?
Mr. Mccausland?!

840
00:48:07,894 --> 00:48:09,161
Wwhooaaaa!

841
00:48:09,196 --> 00:48:11,296
Why was your house the only
one with power in the city?

842
00:48:11,332 --> 00:48:13,865
Can you make a
statement, sir?

843
00:48:16,737 --> 00:48:18,837
Is this a political statement?

844
00:48:21,908 --> 00:48:23,875
We need to talk about this.

845
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:25,877
Could we not discuss
current events

846
00:48:25,912 --> 00:48:26,878
this morning, michael?

847
00:48:26,913 --> 00:48:29,648
I am talking
about this!

848
00:48:29,683 --> 00:48:32,784
This is our house on the front page of the paper!

849
00:48:32,819 --> 00:48:34,986
We've got tv reporters outside right now!

850
00:48:35,022 --> 00:48:36,121
Ah, cool!

851
00:48:37,924 --> 00:48:38,890
Hello?

852
00:48:38,925 --> 00:48:39,891
Francis?

853
00:48:39,926 --> 00:48:43,195
You know we are not
trying to pressure you,

854
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:44,896
but even you must admit

855
00:48:44,931 --> 00:48:47,899
that you have not adequately
explained what you where doing

856
00:48:47,934 --> 00:48:49,801
with that ladder last night.

857
00:48:49,836 --> 00:48:50,969
Francis?

858
00:48:51,004 --> 00:48:54,906
This has nothing to do with
the public right to know!

859
00:48:54,941 --> 00:48:56,208
Francis? Are we
communicating?

860
00:48:56,243 --> 00:48:58,009
Nope!

861
00:48:58,045 --> 00:48:59,344
What, mom?

862
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:01,846
A chick from channel 15
news is out there.

863
00:49:01,882 --> 00:49:02,847
Oh, she's a hotty.

864
00:49:02,883 --> 00:49:04,949
If you want to know
about our family,

865
00:49:04,985 --> 00:49:06,818
visit our web site.

866
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,493
Maybe we ought to get
away from the house.

867
00:49:14,528 --> 00:49:16,861
Why don't we take
a family drive?

868
00:49:16,897 --> 00:49:19,431
Aw, gee, i would
love that...

869
00:49:19,466 --> 00:49:21,866
but i've got this
elective dental surgery.

870
00:49:21,902 --> 00:49:24,869
Listen, bert--

871
00:49:24,905 --> 00:49:26,871
and i don't feel good.
Can i stay home too?

872
00:49:26,907 --> 00:49:29,841
After what you were up to
last night, young lady--

873
00:49:29,876 --> 00:49:32,877
just... michael.

874
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:54,399
Whooo!

875
00:49:56,036 --> 00:49:57,001
Time flies.

876
00:49:57,037 --> 00:49:58,903
Ha! Nice catch.

877
00:49:58,939 --> 00:50:00,672
You're all right?

878
00:50:00,708 --> 00:50:02,541
Just <i>all right?</i>

879
00:50:02,576 --> 00:50:04,409
And i thought i
was great! Ha!

880
00:50:04,445 --> 00:50:06,478
When you fell off
the roof last night,

881
00:50:06,513 --> 00:50:07,912
i thought
that you were...

882
00:50:07,948 --> 00:50:09,814
get real,
francis.

883
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:11,082
If i can quote your
friend, joanne.

884
00:50:11,118 --> 00:50:14,052
Well, former friend.
Thanks to the boogeyman.

885
00:50:15,922 --> 00:50:18,690
Are you sure you didn't do anything to make him mad?

886
00:50:18,726 --> 00:50:21,025
Hello? I think
i'd remember

887
00:50:21,061 --> 00:50:24,630
if i'd ever done anything to the boogeyman.

888
00:50:24,665 --> 00:50:26,931
Ok, francis. Ok.

889
00:50:30,971 --> 00:50:33,938
Are you saying because
you're imaginary

890
00:50:33,974 --> 00:50:35,807
that you can't
ever die?

891
00:50:36,943 --> 00:50:37,942
I never asked!

892
00:50:37,978 --> 00:50:40,445
Well, so, what, you
never get old?

893
00:50:40,481 --> 00:50:43,948
You just stay young forever,
like... peter pan?

894
00:50:43,984 --> 00:50:46,951
Our friends grow
up, then...

895
00:50:46,987 --> 00:50:47,952
they don't need
us anymore.

896
00:50:47,988 --> 00:50:49,388
So we go find
new friends.

897
00:50:49,423 --> 00:50:50,955
Makin' new friends
keeps you young.

898
00:50:50,991 --> 00:50:51,956
Just like aerobics.

899
00:50:51,992 --> 00:50:53,958
Tae bo. Tai chi.
All that good stuff!

900
00:50:53,994 --> 00:50:55,960
Well, then why didn't
you get a new friend

901
00:50:55,996 --> 00:50:58,029
when darwin stopped
believing in you?

902
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,800
Because darwin

903
00:51:01,835 --> 00:51:02,867
still needed me.

904
00:51:05,939 --> 00:51:06,871
Well...

905
00:51:08,776 --> 00:51:10,909
what is this thing anyway?

906
00:51:10,944 --> 00:51:12,577
Temporalfuge.

907
00:51:13,947 --> 00:51:14,879
Ohhh.

908
00:51:15,949 --> 00:51:17,683
How does it work?

909
00:51:17,718 --> 00:51:19,017
Assuming it works.

910
00:51:19,052 --> 00:51:21,920
Oh, it's so simple, a
child could understand it.

911
00:51:21,955 --> 00:51:23,922
In fact, a grown-up couldn't
understand it at all.

912
00:51:23,957 --> 00:51:25,924
All right. If you
spin the clock

913
00:51:25,959 --> 00:51:27,693
clockwise at the right rpm,

914
00:51:27,728 --> 00:51:30,362
it creates, what you call a
temporal fugitation impulse.

915
00:51:30,397 --> 00:51:31,930
You take the fugitation
impulse and

916
00:51:31,965 --> 00:51:33,565
you amplify it with
magnetic fields,

917
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,702
and then the speaker sends it
through the vacuum chamber.

918
00:51:36,737 --> 00:51:38,269
Well, that's dad's
vacuum cleaner!

919
00:51:40,541 --> 00:51:42,841
Your dad does
the vacuuming?

920
00:51:42,876 --> 00:51:44,710
Yeah, he likes to
do the house work.

921
00:51:44,745 --> 00:51:46,945
This is starting to
get unbelievable.

922
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:48,947
Anyways, after resonating
the vacuum chamber,

923
00:51:48,982 --> 00:51:50,949
the impulses go through
these jumper cables

924
00:51:50,984 --> 00:51:54,519
and right into the boogeyman.

925
00:51:54,555 --> 00:51:55,954
And?

926
00:51:55,989 --> 00:51:58,957
A boogeyman has got a very
tightly wound biological clock.

927
00:51:58,992 --> 00:52:01,460
That's why they only bother you
when you're a little kid.

928
00:52:01,495 --> 00:52:02,894
By the time you grow up,

929
00:52:02,929 --> 00:52:04,896
the boogeyman is
tired and retired.

930
00:52:04,931 --> 00:52:07,232
No, no. Then why is
he bothering me now?

931
00:52:10,937 --> 00:52:14,373
That's a very good
question, fran.

932
00:52:16,844 --> 00:52:18,910
Anywho, the temporalfuge
speeds it up.

933
00:52:18,945 --> 00:52:21,913
Thirty seconds on this baby,
he's got a white, long beard,

934
00:52:21,948 --> 00:52:23,682
walking with a cane,
eating some prunes.

935
00:52:23,717 --> 00:52:26,485
He's harmless. Too
old to boogey.

936
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,353
You expect me to
believe all this?

937
00:52:28,389 --> 00:52:29,921
It's in the book.

938
00:52:29,956 --> 00:52:31,222
What do you want, a
demonstration?

939
00:52:31,258 --> 00:52:33,925
Yeah.

940
00:52:35,962 --> 00:52:36,961
Stay back.

941
00:52:36,997 --> 00:52:39,931
It's still experimental.

942
00:52:39,966 --> 00:52:42,267
I would've said
ridiculous.

943
00:52:47,007 --> 00:52:50,442
I'm going to
pull the switch.

944
00:52:59,152 --> 00:53:02,754
They said i was crazy
at the university.

945
00:53:03,924 --> 00:53:06,658
It's alive!

946
00:53:06,693 --> 00:53:08,894
But now i've showed them.

947
00:53:08,929 --> 00:53:11,996
Now they'll see
who has the last laugh.

948
00:53:12,032 --> 00:53:14,466
Ha ha!

949
00:53:14,501 --> 00:53:16,868
Ha ha ha!

950
00:53:18,038 --> 00:53:19,270
Oooh!

951
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:24,876
It's not funny!

952
00:53:27,247 --> 00:53:29,080
Sorry.

953
00:53:29,115 --> 00:53:31,917
You know, this stuff
smells disgusting.

954
00:53:31,952 --> 00:53:34,753
It's sour.

955
00:53:34,788 --> 00:53:37,288
It's been fugitated. It's
like two months old now.

956
00:53:37,324 --> 00:53:39,925
I don't know why i went
kablooey like that.

957
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,927
The temporalfuge must be
lactose intolerant or something.

958
00:53:41,962 --> 00:53:43,929
Oouch! You scratched me!

959
00:53:43,964 --> 00:53:45,864
Give me that!

960
00:53:49,803 --> 00:53:50,902
I used to bite them.

961
00:53:52,539 --> 00:53:55,774
Uh-hmm, so that's why they grow really fast now.

962
00:53:55,809 --> 00:53:58,944
Man, there is something
strange going on with you.

963
00:53:58,979 --> 00:54:00,512
Like, how would
you know?

964
00:54:00,547 --> 00:54:02,881
Have you known any other imaginary people?

965
00:54:02,916 --> 00:54:04,883
I could be
perfectly normal.

966
00:54:04,918 --> 00:54:05,884
Ha! Yeah, right.

967
00:54:05,919 --> 00:54:07,185
And pigs
could fly.

968
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:09,888
Look, i'm gonna go
take a cold shower.

969
00:54:09,923 --> 00:54:12,858
Maybe that'll wake me
up from this nightmare.

970
00:54:40,186 --> 00:54:42,687
Ooh, is that a zit?

971
00:54:42,723 --> 00:54:44,890
Girl, you need to take care of your skin.

972
00:54:48,662 --> 00:54:50,929
Great. I'm still dreaming.

973
00:54:50,964 --> 00:54:52,196
Over here.

974
00:54:55,869 --> 00:54:57,836
What are you doing in there?

975
00:54:57,871 --> 00:54:59,804
Just pausing
to reflect.

976
00:55:01,875 --> 00:55:03,875
Get out! Ok? Get out!

977
00:55:03,911 --> 00:55:05,844
It's creepy.

978
00:55:14,922 --> 00:55:15,887
Oh.

979
00:55:15,923 --> 00:55:17,221
There.

980
00:55:18,291 --> 00:55:19,891
How long have you been in there?

981
00:55:19,927 --> 00:55:21,593
I was just thinking,

982
00:55:21,628 --> 00:55:23,895
now that the boogeyman
knows we're after him,

983
00:55:23,931 --> 00:55:25,897
he may not come out
from under the bed

984
00:55:25,933 --> 00:55:26,898
for who knows
how long.

985
00:55:26,934 --> 00:55:28,900
You know.
Lay low.

986
00:55:28,936 --> 00:55:31,670
Why can't we just wait for him to come out?

987
00:55:31,705 --> 00:55:32,904
What's the hurry?

988
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,138
Oh, no. No.
There's no hurry

989
00:55:34,174 --> 00:55:35,941
i just thought it'd be
nice to get it over with.

990
00:55:35,976 --> 00:55:38,209
You know, before
something bad happens.

991
00:55:38,244 --> 00:55:39,911
Bad?

992
00:55:39,947 --> 00:55:42,346
I mean if it does.

993
00:55:42,382 --> 00:55:44,115
So how do we get this over with?

994
00:55:46,386 --> 00:55:48,687
It's all in
the book.

995
00:55:48,722 --> 00:55:50,922
This is what's to be
called, "boogey goo."

996
00:55:50,958 --> 00:55:51,923
Boogey goo.

997
00:55:51,959 --> 00:55:54,926
Boogeymen love
this stuff.

998
00:55:54,962 --> 00:55:57,929
It's gonna take me a while to get the ingredients, but...

999
00:55:57,965 --> 00:55:59,931
why don't you try
the supermarket?

1000
00:55:59,967 --> 00:56:01,800
Imaginary food
section.

1001
00:56:02,736 --> 00:56:04,368
That's a good idea.

1002
00:56:04,404 --> 00:56:05,870
Fran, you are so smart.

1003
00:56:05,906 --> 00:56:06,304
Ap...

1004
00:56:06,339 --> 00:56:06,571
a spell or a..."

1005
00:56:06,607 --> 00:56:07,005
you di

1006
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:07,806
a spell or a..."

1007
00:56:07,841 --> 00:56:07,872
you didn't say charm.
I know that.

1008
00:56:09,943 --> 00:56:12,877
That's a lovely little
bust you have there.

1009
00:56:14,915 --> 00:56:16,915
Ohhh, yes.

1010
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:17,916
Thank you.

1011
00:56:17,951 --> 00:56:19,918
It's a reproduction, of course.

1012
00:56:19,953 --> 00:56:22,921
You know, you don't get rich
being a cultural anthropologist.

1013
00:56:22,956 --> 00:56:25,289
Oh, tell me about it.

1014
00:56:25,325 --> 00:56:27,759
And what do you
do, michael?

1015
00:56:27,794 --> 00:56:31,462
I've got a phd in solid
waste engineering.

1016
00:56:32,966 --> 00:56:35,000
Piled higher
and deeper.

1017
00:56:36,202 --> 00:56:37,268
Ha ha ha ha!

1018
00:56:38,972 --> 00:56:42,507
It's so caring of you to invite me
into your home environment,

1019
00:56:42,542 --> 00:56:44,242
and give francis
and i a chance

1020
00:56:44,277 --> 00:56:45,944
to get to
know each other.

1021
00:56:45,979 --> 00:56:46,945
Francis and <i>me.</i>

1022
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:47,946
Uh-huh.

1023
00:56:47,981 --> 00:56:49,914
Can i be excused?

1024
00:56:52,285 --> 00:56:54,953
Yes. Of course you may, francis.

1025
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:59,924
I'm gonna to go to
my room environment.

1026
00:57:05,932 --> 00:57:07,866
What are you doing?

1027
00:57:11,104 --> 00:57:12,904
Oooh!

1028
00:57:12,939 --> 00:57:15,874
Ooh! That smells
so disgusting!

1029
00:57:15,909 --> 00:57:17,909
It's boogey goo!

1030
00:57:17,944 --> 00:57:19,210
Oh, yeah.
Boogey goo.

1031
00:57:19,245 --> 00:57:20,912
You need to clean this up

1032
00:57:20,947 --> 00:57:23,347
before somebody comes in
here and sees all this.

1033
00:57:23,383 --> 00:57:26,851
I think it's about done, anyway.

1034
00:57:27,954 --> 00:57:28,887
What's in that?

1035
00:57:31,958 --> 00:57:33,692
Hee hee hee hee!

1036
00:57:33,727 --> 00:57:35,927
It's so good! It's so
good! It's so good!

1037
00:57:35,962 --> 00:57:38,930
Some rotten eggs,
burnt sugar,

1038
00:57:38,965 --> 00:57:41,933
jalapeño peppers,
limburger cheese,

1039
00:57:41,968 --> 00:57:43,935
some anchovies,
bacon grease,

1040
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:45,636
ah, one of
those guys.

1041
00:57:45,672 --> 00:57:47,939
And your...

1042
00:57:47,974 --> 00:57:50,942
daily requirement of iron.

1043
00:57:50,977 --> 00:57:52,310
A couple of slugs,

1044
00:57:52,345 --> 00:57:54,946
some leftovers from
the school cafeteria.

1045
00:57:54,981 --> 00:57:56,715
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1046
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:57,716
Aahh!

1047
00:57:57,751 --> 00:57:58,717
Sick!

1048
00:57:58,752 --> 00:57:59,718
Yeah!

1049
00:57:59,753 --> 00:58:00,885
Don't you hate leftovers?

1050
00:58:00,921 --> 00:58:03,888
Oh, and i needed
some week-old sweat,

1051
00:58:03,924 --> 00:58:06,758
so i ran one of bert's gym
socks through the blender.

1052
00:58:07,928 --> 00:58:09,894
Well, you did wash it out when
you were done, didn't you?

1053
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:11,596
Say what?

1054
00:58:11,631 --> 00:58:13,898
You did wash it out--

1055
00:58:13,934 --> 00:58:15,867
this is expensive.

1056
00:58:17,938 --> 00:58:19,904
Pudding, ms. Readle?

1057
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:21,940
Oh, thank you.

1058
00:58:21,975 --> 00:58:23,908
It looks delicious.

1059
00:58:23,944 --> 00:58:26,878
Excuse me. I think i smell
something... strange.

1060
00:58:27,948 --> 00:58:30,915
We can pour a trail
of boogey goo,

1061
00:58:30,951 --> 00:58:33,918
and lead the boogeyman straight into the temporalfuge.

1062
00:58:33,954 --> 00:58:34,919
Ooh!

1063
00:58:34,955 --> 00:58:36,721
Francis?

1064
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:45,930
Why? And what in the
world are you cooking?

1065
00:58:45,966 --> 00:58:48,032
It's... uh...

1066
00:58:48,068 --> 00:58:49,100
homework.

1067
00:58:49,136 --> 00:58:50,769
For home ec.

1068
00:58:50,804 --> 00:58:53,571
You are not taking
home... ec.

1069
00:58:54,741 --> 00:58:55,940
That's why i'm
cooking it at home.

1070
00:58:55,976 --> 00:58:57,909
I think everyone should
learn how to cook.

1071
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:02,413
This doesn't not smell
like food, francis.

1072
00:59:05,886 --> 00:59:07,852
You're right. I'm
gonna take it out.

1073
00:59:15,929 --> 00:59:17,896
Ok. I think it's about time

1074
00:59:17,931 --> 00:59:19,898
we started telling each
other the truth, young lady.

1075
00:59:19,933 --> 00:59:21,199
Now, mom?

1076
00:59:21,234 --> 00:59:22,867
Yes. Now.

1077
00:59:22,903 --> 00:59:26,905
Francis, your father
and i both know

1078
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:28,907
that something is
going on with you,

1079
00:59:28,942 --> 00:59:31,142
and that you are
involved somehow

1080
00:59:31,178 --> 00:59:32,911
with what's going
on in middleburg.

1081
00:59:32,946 --> 00:59:34,212
Mom--

1082
00:59:34,247 --> 00:59:35,914
we don't want to punish
you, francis--

1083
00:59:35,949 --> 00:59:37,282
can we move?

1084
00:59:37,317 --> 00:59:41,686
We just want to understand
why you are doing it.

1085
00:59:41,721 --> 00:59:44,488
I can't help but feel
that your father and i

1086
00:59:44,524 --> 00:59:46,490
are partially
responsible.

1087
00:59:46,526 --> 00:59:49,928
That maybe we forced you
to grow up too fast.

1088
00:59:49,963 --> 00:59:54,465
This has a very
interesting flavor.

1089
00:59:56,669 --> 00:59:59,938
Do i detect a
hint of nutmeg?

1090
00:59:59,973 --> 01:00:02,340
Just a little bit.

1091
01:00:10,984 --> 01:00:15,453
That looks like
bert's gym sock.

1092
01:00:15,488 --> 01:00:16,955
Oh!

1093
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:18,957
I know what we went
through with darwin

1094
01:00:18,992 --> 01:00:21,960
must've been very
hard for you.

1095
01:00:21,995 --> 01:00:24,963
We almost lost him, and
that was very scary.

1096
01:00:24,998 --> 01:00:26,965
Even for the grown-ups--

1097
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,934
what kind of cookbook is this, honey,
because i'm just a little--

1098
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:30,969
karen!

1099
01:00:31,004 --> 01:00:34,973
Now, don't go, 'cause
we gotta start now.

1100
01:00:35,008 --> 01:00:35,974
I'll be back.

1101
01:00:36,009 --> 01:00:37,976
Karen,
honey!

1102
01:00:38,011 --> 01:00:39,043
Karen, need a
little help!

1103
01:00:40,446 --> 01:00:42,113
Larry?

1104
01:00:43,049 --> 01:00:44,815
Larry?

1105
01:00:44,851 --> 01:00:45,950
Uuh!

1106
01:00:48,521 --> 01:00:49,988
Larry?

1107
01:00:50,023 --> 01:00:51,956
Uuh, uuh.

1108
01:00:58,198 --> 01:00:59,998
What are you
doing in there?

1109
01:01:00,033 --> 01:01:01,933
I got hungry.

1110
01:01:01,968 --> 01:01:05,003
Get out. Get out!

1111
01:01:20,887 --> 01:01:22,887
Can you help me?

1112
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:26,891
Can you help me?

1113
01:01:36,636 --> 01:01:38,602
How can you eat
that stuff?

1114
01:01:38,638 --> 01:01:41,940
It kinda taste
like chicken,

1115
01:01:41,975 --> 01:01:43,942
with a... with a hint of...

1116
01:01:43,977 --> 01:01:44,943
of nutmeg!

1117
01:01:44,978 --> 01:01:45,944
Yeah.

1118
01:01:45,979 --> 01:01:48,913
What is going on
with you, larry?

1119
01:01:49,983 --> 01:01:52,850
First, your eyes...

1120
01:01:52,885 --> 01:01:54,518
your fingernails...

1121
01:01:54,554 --> 01:01:56,587
now you're eating
boogey goo.

1122
01:01:56,622 --> 01:01:59,590
Look. I'm not...

1123
01:01:59,625 --> 01:02:01,259
turning into a
boogeyman, ok?

1124
01:02:01,294 --> 01:02:03,261
You got that?

1125
01:02:03,296 --> 01:02:04,862
Don't go there!

1126
01:02:07,934 --> 01:02:09,900
Don't go there, francis!

1127
01:02:09,936 --> 01:02:11,936
Larry?

1128
01:02:14,941 --> 01:02:17,908
Just keep taking deep
breaths, ms. Readle.

1129
01:02:17,944 --> 01:02:19,143
Ok.

1130
01:02:19,179 --> 01:02:21,012
I'm going to get some
anti-nausea medicine.

1131
01:02:21,047 --> 01:02:22,880
And a waste basket.

1132
01:02:22,915 --> 01:02:24,215
May i be excused?

1133
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:26,917
I hate seeing
people barf.

1134
01:02:42,335 --> 01:02:45,036
You are turning into a
boogeyman, aren't you?

1135
01:02:45,071 --> 01:02:46,937
What makes you say that?

1136
01:02:46,973 --> 01:02:50,674
Where do boogeymen
come from, larry?

1137
01:02:51,978 --> 01:02:53,677
Is it in the book?

1138
01:02:59,819 --> 01:03:03,721
"If a child stops believing in
an imaginary friend too soon,

1139
01:03:03,756 --> 01:03:09,293
the imaginary friend... may
turn into a boogeyman."

1140
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:12,863
That's what's happening
to you, isn't it?

1141
01:03:14,934 --> 01:03:19,303
Because i made darwin stop
believing in you too soon.

1142
01:03:21,941 --> 01:03:23,408
Larry, i'm trying to help you.

1143
01:03:23,443 --> 01:03:24,942
Just go away, ok?
You can't help me.

1144
01:03:24,977 --> 01:03:27,912
Don't say i can't help, ok?!

1145
01:03:27,947 --> 01:03:30,881
That's a terrible
thing to say.

1146
01:03:33,453 --> 01:03:35,920
Who are you talking to?

1147
01:03:35,955 --> 01:03:37,922
Darwin, i'm trying to have a private conversation here.

1148
01:03:37,957 --> 01:03:40,624
Does that mean you're
talking to yourself?

1149
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:43,561
Will you just please leave
me alone for a little while?

1150
01:03:43,596 --> 01:03:45,163
It's my room.

1151
01:03:45,198 --> 01:03:46,931
Please?

1152
01:03:46,966 --> 01:03:49,900
Ok, but then i
get your room.

1153
01:03:51,938 --> 01:03:53,037
Would you give this
to darwin for me?

1154
01:03:53,073 --> 01:03:54,939
He's looking all
over for it.

1155
01:03:54,974 --> 01:03:57,975
Maybe you could give
it to him yourself.

1156
01:03:58,010 --> 01:03:59,944
Or maybe i could
talk to darwin

1157
01:03:59,979 --> 01:04:01,845
and i could get him to
believe in you again.

1158
01:04:01,881 --> 01:04:05,649
It's a little late
for that, fran.

1159
01:04:05,685 --> 01:04:07,651
Larry?

1160
01:04:09,922 --> 01:04:10,888
Oh, there you are.

1161
01:04:10,923 --> 01:04:12,190
Nestor here is a diver.

1162
01:04:12,225 --> 01:04:13,891
You can go for
rides on his back.

1163
01:04:13,926 --> 01:04:16,894
He might even give you
swimming lessons.

1164
01:04:18,931 --> 01:04:21,799
Do you smell something?

1165
01:04:28,941 --> 01:04:31,909
Hey. How are you doing?

1166
01:04:31,944 --> 01:04:34,878
Now, watch.

1167
01:04:41,954 --> 01:04:43,921
Boogey goo!

1168
01:04:43,956 --> 01:04:45,689
Stop it, larry! Ok?
That's disgusting!

1169
01:04:45,725 --> 01:04:47,158
Ha ha ha! He he!

1170
01:04:47,193 --> 01:04:51,929
Boogey goo! I think i must've
spilled it on the kitchen floor.

1171
01:04:51,964 --> 01:04:54,932
And you stepped in it.

1172
01:04:54,967 --> 01:04:57,901
I didn't step in any
boogey goo, ok?!

1173
01:04:57,937 --> 01:04:59,903
Then how did it
get up here?

1174
01:05:02,908 --> 01:05:03,874
Darwin!
Darwin!

1175
01:05:03,909 --> 01:05:06,844
Now watch me dive.

1176
01:05:10,916 --> 01:05:13,851
Aaaahhhhh!

1177
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,854
Darwin?

1178
01:05:17,923 --> 01:05:19,890
Darwin?!

1179
01:05:32,938 --> 01:05:35,273
Why are you breathing like that?

1180
01:05:35,308 --> 01:05:38,409
There's something in my--

1181
01:05:38,444 --> 01:05:39,977
there's something in my throat.

1182
01:05:41,947 --> 01:05:43,914
He must be downstairs.

1183
01:05:43,949 --> 01:05:46,750
Oh! That's awful!

1184
01:05:46,786 --> 01:05:47,918
What did you expect?

1185
01:05:47,953 --> 01:05:50,888
The boogeyman licked
the shoe! Blaaa!

1186
01:05:54,527 --> 01:05:56,927
Are you telling me that the
boogeyman's got darwin?

1187
01:05:56,962 --> 01:05:59,930
It must be after his sole.

1188
01:05:59,965 --> 01:06:01,832
It's got boogey goo on it.

1189
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:06,437
I looked under the bed, and
darwin is not under there.

1190
01:06:06,472 --> 01:06:07,871
No, no, no, no.
He's under there,

1191
01:06:07,907 --> 01:06:10,374
you just can't see him.

1192
01:06:10,410 --> 01:06:13,977
Darwin's in the
boogey world, now.

1193
01:06:14,013 --> 01:06:16,314
I'm gonna go get my
temporalfuge, all right?

1194
01:06:16,349 --> 01:06:18,416
Boogey world?

1195
01:06:19,919 --> 01:06:22,653
No. No, no, no.
Yes.

1196
01:06:22,689 --> 01:06:24,855
Now you have gone too...

1197
01:06:26,926 --> 01:06:28,626
far.

1198
01:06:31,964 --> 01:06:35,899
Ok, i refuse to believe
in some invisible place

1199
01:06:35,935 --> 01:06:37,268
called the boogey world.

1200
01:06:37,303 --> 01:06:40,671
C'mon, fran. You believe in
the boogeyman, don't you?

1201
01:06:40,707 --> 01:06:41,905
I haven't seen him.

1202
01:06:41,941 --> 01:06:43,907
You didn't see him on
the roof last night?

1203
01:06:43,943 --> 01:06:47,278
All i saw was you and a
lot of blinky lights.

1204
01:06:47,313 --> 01:06:49,913
Besides, it's hard to believe in something you can't see.

1205
01:06:49,949 --> 01:06:51,549
You mean like electricity.

1206
01:06:51,584 --> 01:06:52,550
Oh, come on.

1207
01:06:52,585 --> 01:06:53,618
Atoms, molecules,

1208
01:06:53,653 --> 01:06:55,586
gravity.

1209
01:06:56,989 --> 01:06:59,223
Ok, ok.

1210
01:06:59,259 --> 01:07:03,561
If there was a...

1211
01:07:03,596 --> 01:07:04,862
boogey world,

1212
01:07:04,897 --> 01:07:05,863
how do we get
into it?

1213
01:07:05,898 --> 01:07:07,431
<i>We</i> don't.

1214
01:07:07,467 --> 01:07:09,867
This job is for a
professional.

1215
01:07:09,902 --> 01:07:13,103
Look, i am not going to sit
up here and do nothing, ok?

1216
01:07:13,139 --> 01:07:15,105
You have no idea
how hard it was

1217
01:07:15,141 --> 01:07:16,874
when darwin was sick and i
couldn't do anthing--

1218
01:07:16,909 --> 01:07:19,176
and you told him he should
stop believing in me!

1219
01:07:19,211 --> 01:07:20,878
You were a big
help then, fran.

1220
01:07:20,913 --> 01:07:22,045
Why are you
being so mean?

1221
01:07:22,081 --> 01:07:23,781
What do you expect?!

1222
01:07:23,816 --> 01:07:25,449
I'm turning into a
boogeyman, ok?!

1223
01:07:25,485 --> 01:07:27,418
Ok, francis?

1224
01:07:32,925 --> 01:07:34,892
I'm going with you.

1225
01:07:34,927 --> 01:07:36,894
What if i boogey down the rest
of the way while you're in there?

1226
01:07:36,929 --> 01:07:39,597
You may get trapped in boogey
world, just like darwin.

1227
01:07:39,632 --> 01:07:41,064
I'm not worried about
what happens to me.

1228
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:43,867
I am! Ok? I am.

1229
01:07:44,937 --> 01:07:46,904
Larry...

1230
01:07:46,939 --> 01:07:48,906
what?!

1231
01:07:48,941 --> 01:07:54,077
What you said about me being
relieved when i couldn't be a donor...

1232
01:07:54,113 --> 01:07:56,880
it's true.

1233
01:07:58,918 --> 01:08:00,851
I was glad it
had to be bert,

1234
01:08:00,886 --> 01:08:03,487
because i was scared.

1235
01:08:03,523 --> 01:08:07,224
Real people get
scared, fran.

1236
01:08:07,259 --> 01:08:11,796
It's perfectly logical.

1237
01:08:29,915 --> 01:08:31,882
Aaah!

1238
01:08:31,917 --> 01:08:34,618
Oh, i hate that
stupid thing!

1239
01:08:55,975 --> 01:08:57,908
Aaah!

1240
01:08:57,943 --> 01:08:59,877
Please do not do
that, dad?!

1241
01:09:02,114 --> 01:09:07,150
Francis, did you put a
gym sock in the blender?

1242
01:09:07,186 --> 01:09:09,687
Dad, i'm kinda in the middle of something right now.

1243
01:09:09,722 --> 01:09:11,555
Well, it's just going
to have to wait,

1244
01:09:11,591 --> 01:09:13,691
because i am not
leaving here

1245
01:09:13,726 --> 01:09:16,059
until i hear the truth
about everything.

1246
01:09:18,898 --> 01:09:19,830
Ok.

1247
01:09:21,601 --> 01:09:24,869
It was...

1248
01:09:24,904 --> 01:09:26,537
the boogeyman.

1249
01:09:27,907 --> 01:09:29,373
Ok? The boogeyman.

1250
01:09:29,409 --> 01:09:31,842
You know, and he's got darwin
under the bed, right now.

1251
01:09:31,878 --> 01:09:33,878
And he has been the
cause of everything

1252
01:09:33,913 --> 01:09:35,846
that has been
happening around here.

1253
01:09:42,422 --> 01:09:46,256
Maybe you would be more comfortable
speaking with your mother about this.

1254
01:09:46,292 --> 01:09:47,858
Sure.

1255
01:09:54,934 --> 01:09:56,166
Bye.

1256
01:10:25,965 --> 01:10:27,898
Larry! Larry!

1257
01:10:28,968 --> 01:10:30,901
Larry!

1258
01:10:33,473 --> 01:10:36,941
You know what? I had a feeling
you were following me.

1259
01:10:36,976 --> 01:10:38,909
Especially when you
started yanking my cord.

1260
01:10:44,684 --> 01:10:46,951
Where are we?

1261
01:10:46,986 --> 01:10:50,855
Under your bed, sort of.

1262
01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:53,323
You believe in the
boogey world now?

1263
01:10:53,359 --> 01:10:55,659
This isn't happening.

1264
01:10:55,695 --> 01:10:56,961
It's so big.

1265
01:10:56,996 --> 01:10:59,964
Imagine if you had a
queen-size bed. Whooo!

1266
01:10:59,999 --> 01:11:01,899
Now that's big.

1267
01:11:01,934 --> 01:11:03,901
How am i gonna find
darwin in this?

1268
01:11:03,936 --> 01:11:05,903
Well, we can walk

1269
01:11:05,938 --> 01:11:07,872
or take the car.

1270
01:11:08,941 --> 01:11:10,541
Is that darwin's toy car?

1271
01:11:10,576 --> 01:11:13,911
Yeah.
You should've seen me trying to get it out of my pocket.

1272
01:11:13,946 --> 01:11:15,513
Whooo!

1273
01:11:16,949 --> 01:11:18,916
Do you think that the
boogeyman would hurt darwin?

1274
01:11:18,951 --> 01:11:19,917
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1275
01:11:19,952 --> 01:11:21,886
You're the one he's after.

1276
01:11:21,921 --> 01:11:24,922
I figure darwin's just the bait
to get you under the bed.

1277
01:11:24,957 --> 01:11:26,757
So you better watch your back,

1278
01:11:26,792 --> 01:11:30,661
your front, your sides, your right, your left,
and-- whoo-hoo! Over your head!

1279
01:11:32,598 --> 01:11:33,931
Look out!

1280
01:11:33,966 --> 01:11:35,165
Stop! Stop!

1281
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:38,903
Is that the boogeyman?
Is that the boogeyman?

1282
01:11:39,972 --> 01:11:43,941
No. This is a
peanut-butter sandwich.

1283
01:11:43,976 --> 01:11:46,376
Why is the boogeyman
after me?

1284
01:11:46,412 --> 01:11:48,178
Why doesn't he just
leave me alone?

1285
01:11:48,213 --> 01:11:50,915
Did you ever have an
imaginary friend?

1286
01:11:53,953 --> 01:11:55,920
No. Never.

1287
01:11:57,990 --> 01:12:00,858
Maybe it's just a
boogey thing.

1288
01:12:13,039 --> 01:12:14,538
So sick!

1289
01:12:14,574 --> 01:12:17,741
Ok, we gotta push the
car to get it started.

1290
01:12:17,777 --> 01:12:21,344
Ah, hello?
Why don't you use the jumper cables on your back?

1291
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:23,914
Jumper cables only
work on real cars.

1292
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:26,216
We're gonna have to
push it backwards.

1293
01:12:26,251 --> 01:12:28,552
I bet you only had
educational toys.

1294
01:12:28,588 --> 01:12:31,021
C'mon. Let's just
find darwin.

1295
01:12:36,528 --> 01:12:38,929
C'mon, fran, put
your back into it.

1296
01:12:38,965 --> 01:12:39,964
I am.

1297
01:12:39,999 --> 01:12:41,899
Get on. Get on.

1298
01:12:46,072 --> 01:12:48,939
Hurry. Hurry,
it's slipping.

1299
01:12:48,975 --> 01:12:50,741
Oooh!

1300
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,080
Turn left! Turn left!

1301
01:13:05,925 --> 01:13:08,325
Larry! Aaaah!

1302
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:10,327
Turn right! Right, right!

1303
01:13:10,362 --> 01:13:11,895
What is going on?

1304
01:13:11,931 --> 01:13:13,864
You don't even
know how to drive!

1305
01:13:19,505 --> 01:13:20,904
Watch out! Watch out!

1306
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:23,173
Aaaaaahhh!

1307
01:13:28,948 --> 01:13:31,248
Oh, there's nothing like
the wind in your hair!

1308
01:13:41,961 --> 01:13:44,862
Woo hoo hoo!

1309
01:13:45,965 --> 01:13:46,930
Larry!

1310
01:13:46,966 --> 01:13:48,498
Let go of the cord!

1311
01:13:48,534 --> 01:13:50,734
Aaaah!

1312
01:13:57,143 --> 01:13:58,108
Look out!

1313
01:13:58,144 --> 01:13:59,910
Look out, fran!

1314
01:14:09,955 --> 01:14:11,454
Fran?

1315
01:14:14,193 --> 01:14:15,926
Fran, are you ok?

1316
01:14:15,961 --> 01:14:17,895
I bit my lip.

1317
01:14:28,874 --> 01:14:30,941
Francis!

1318
01:14:30,976 --> 01:14:32,943
Where am i, francis?

1319
01:14:32,978 --> 01:14:34,945
Francis!

1320
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:37,948
Darwin! Darwin!

1321
01:14:37,983 --> 01:14:39,950
Oooh!

1322
01:14:39,985 --> 01:14:41,952
It smells like a
dirty sock in here!

1323
01:14:41,987 --> 01:14:43,954
Don't worr darwin!
I'm gonna get you out.

1324
01:14:43,989 --> 01:14:46,890
Help me!

1325
01:14:53,999 --> 01:14:55,966
Ooh!

1326
01:14:56,001 --> 01:14:58,936
I remember when i couldn't
even get these on you.

1327
01:15:04,944 --> 01:15:06,910
Ha ha ha.

1328
01:15:09,949 --> 01:15:11,915
Uh, fran!

1329
01:15:16,188 --> 01:15:17,687
Francis!

1330
01:15:17,723 --> 01:15:19,522
Larry.

1331
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,895
Turn it up, quick!
He's right behind you!

1332
01:15:26,132 --> 01:15:27,931
Bowling for boogies.

1333
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:32,002
Come on.

1334
01:15:36,976 --> 01:15:39,877
Strike! Yeah!

1335
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:41,945
Help!

1336
01:15:41,981 --> 01:15:45,949
Larry! Larry, it's him!

1337
01:15:47,987 --> 01:15:49,920
It's temporalfuge time!

1338
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:56,326
What? Are you trying
to start something?

1339
01:15:56,361 --> 01:15:58,395
Yeah.

1340
01:15:58,430 --> 01:15:59,863
You.

1341
01:15:59,899 --> 01:16:01,999
Aah!

1342
01:16:02,034 --> 01:16:03,000
Say goodbye.

1343
01:16:03,035 --> 01:16:04,101
No!

1344
01:16:05,938 --> 01:16:06,904
Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!

1345
01:16:06,939 --> 01:16:07,905
Ha ha ha ha!

1346
01:16:07,940 --> 01:16:12,209
Aaaaaahhhh!

1347
01:16:12,244 --> 01:16:13,911
Got ya.

1348
01:16:13,946 --> 01:16:15,279
Huh?

1349
01:16:15,314 --> 01:16:16,713
What's wrong?

1350
01:16:22,855 --> 01:16:25,923
Your extension cord

1351
01:16:25,958 --> 01:16:28,292
has come uncurled.

1352
01:16:28,327 --> 01:16:31,428
And now you're powerless

1353
01:16:31,463 --> 01:16:34,198
in boogey world.

1354
01:16:35,734 --> 01:16:37,301
Don't worry, larry.

1355
01:16:37,336 --> 01:16:39,937
I won't hurt you.

1356
01:16:39,972 --> 01:16:41,939
It's lots more fun

1357
01:16:41,974 --> 01:16:44,908
to just convert you.

1358
01:16:46,979 --> 01:16:47,945
Help!

1359
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:49,947
I'm not a boogeyman, yet.

1360
01:16:49,982 --> 01:16:51,949
There's still time
to bust you!

1361
01:16:51,984 --> 01:16:53,717
Huh?

1362
01:16:53,752 --> 01:16:55,585
Noooo!

1363
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:57,855
Larry, are you ok?

1364
01:16:57,890 --> 01:16:59,422
Who are you talking
to, francis?

1365
01:17:00,692 --> 01:17:01,758
Darwin!

1366
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:06,897
It's coiled around me!

1367
01:17:06,932 --> 01:17:08,832
Larry!

1368
01:17:17,243 --> 01:17:19,276
Francis...

1369
01:17:19,311 --> 01:17:20,911
larry?

1370
01:17:20,946 --> 01:17:26,884
Do you think i look
a little strange?

1371
01:17:26,919 --> 01:17:29,920
But when you grow up,

1372
01:17:29,955 --> 01:17:32,890
sometimes you change!

1373
01:17:35,961 --> 01:17:36,927
Larry...

1374
01:17:36,962 --> 01:17:38,929
francis.

1375
01:17:38,964 --> 01:17:39,930
Larry, you have
to fight this.

1376
01:17:39,965 --> 01:17:40,931
Come, francis.

1377
01:17:40,966 --> 01:17:42,432
Fight what?

1378
01:17:42,467 --> 01:17:43,934
Larry!

1379
01:17:43,969 --> 01:17:46,636
Come, let's play, francis.

1380
01:17:46,671 --> 01:17:48,772
Francis?

1381
01:17:48,807 --> 01:17:49,907
Aaaaahhh!

1382
01:17:49,942 --> 01:17:51,541
Ooooh-ahhhh!

1383
01:17:52,677 --> 01:17:54,945
Aaaah!

1384
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:57,447
Larry, you don't have
to be a boogeyman!

1385
01:17:57,482 --> 01:17:58,949
You said there's
no such thing.

1386
01:17:58,984 --> 01:18:01,385
Franny, franny, franny.

1387
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:03,120
Franny?

1388
01:18:03,155 --> 01:18:06,890
Stash franny in
someplace or other,

1389
01:18:06,926 --> 01:18:09,893
while i get a wig off
her little brother.

1390
01:18:09,929 --> 01:18:11,895
Haaa!

1391
01:18:11,931 --> 01:18:13,897
Larry, you have to help
him! He needs you!

1392
01:18:13,933 --> 01:18:15,399
I'm scared!

1393
01:18:15,434 --> 01:18:17,901
If darwin wanted
me to care,

1394
01:18:17,937 --> 01:18:21,905
he should have asked
for help from larry.

1395
01:18:21,941 --> 01:18:23,873
Get me out, francis!

1396
01:18:25,777 --> 01:18:26,910
I'm scared!

1397
01:18:26,946 --> 01:18:27,945
Did that hurt?

1398
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:29,212
Oh, i'm sorry.

1399
01:18:29,248 --> 01:18:30,948
Darwin, ask larry for help!

1400
01:18:30,983 --> 01:18:32,916
Remember your
friend, larry?

1401
01:18:32,952 --> 01:18:34,918
He's not real. You told me.

1402
01:18:34,954 --> 01:18:36,553
You said we have
to be grown up.

1403
01:18:36,588 --> 01:18:41,925
Ha! It's scary to take
such a long, long drop.

1404
01:18:41,961 --> 01:18:44,794
Francis!

1405
01:18:45,931 --> 01:18:49,933
But even scarier
when you stop.

1406
01:18:49,969 --> 01:18:51,935
I was wrong! I was just afraid!

1407
01:18:51,971 --> 01:18:53,937
Darwin, i didn't
know what to do,

1408
01:18:53,973 --> 01:18:55,939
and i thought that if i was
grown up, i could do anything.

1409
01:18:55,975 --> 01:19:00,444
Ha! You don't get second
chances to be young.

1410
01:19:00,479 --> 01:19:02,245
Darwin! Darwin!

1411
01:19:02,281 --> 01:19:05,382
So, you won't
answer, franny?

1412
01:19:05,417 --> 01:19:06,583
Francis!

1413
01:19:06,618 --> 01:19:08,085
Hold your tongue!

1414
01:19:10,922 --> 01:19:12,922
Darwin! Darwin,
can you hear me?

1415
01:19:12,958 --> 01:19:16,393
Hey, darwin, if you still believe in larry,
clap your hands, ok?

1416
01:19:16,428 --> 01:19:18,895
That's all you have
to do, just clap!

1417
01:19:18,930 --> 01:19:20,330
Shut up! Stop it!

1418
01:19:20,366 --> 01:19:21,898
That's it! Come on, clap!

1419
01:19:21,933 --> 01:19:23,900
Stop it!

1420
01:19:23,935 --> 01:19:27,804
Larry, i need you!
Help me, please!

1421
01:19:27,839 --> 01:19:28,905
Larry!

1422
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:29,906
That's it, darwin!

1423
01:19:29,941 --> 01:19:32,609
Larry, i
need you!

1424
01:19:32,644 --> 01:19:34,677
Aaaaaaah!

1425
01:19:34,713 --> 01:19:36,880
I still believe! Larry!

1426
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:42,919
I'm back!

1427
01:19:42,954 --> 01:19:45,922
And you're busted!

1428
01:19:45,957 --> 01:19:48,958
The temporalfuge! You've got
to plug it in to something!

1429
01:19:51,963 --> 01:19:52,929
Hey! Cut it out!

1430
01:19:52,964 --> 01:19:54,831
C'mon, you guys!

1431
01:19:57,969 --> 01:19:59,936
That's my friend in
there, you scaggy creep!

1432
01:19:59,971 --> 01:20:02,939
Stop! Stop!
Who's pulling me?

1433
01:20:02,974 --> 01:20:03,940
What's going on?!

1434
01:20:03,975 --> 01:20:05,242
You're not gonna
hurt my pal!

1435
01:20:05,277 --> 01:20:06,743
There's no way, man!
All right?

1436
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,947
Francis! Where are
you, francis?!

1437
01:20:10,982 --> 01:20:11,981
Oh.

1438
01:20:14,986 --> 01:20:17,087
Ooh!

1439
01:20:18,090 --> 01:20:20,257
Oow! My foot!

1440
01:20:20,292 --> 01:20:21,958
Francis!

1441
01:20:21,993 --> 01:20:24,227
C'mon, you guys!

1442
01:20:25,764 --> 01:20:27,330
If you think you
can win,

1443
01:20:27,366 --> 01:20:29,966
you're wrong.

1444
01:20:30,001 --> 01:20:30,967
Aaah!

1445
01:20:31,002 --> 01:20:31,935
Larry!

1446
01:20:35,006 --> 01:20:36,940
That boogeyman is
really strong.

1447
01:20:40,779 --> 01:20:43,547
I hate to be the
one to tell you,

1448
01:20:43,582 --> 01:20:46,983
but it's not too late
for me to nail you.

1449
01:20:47,018 --> 01:20:48,985
Ah ha ha!

1450
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:49,953
Aah!

1451
01:20:56,027 --> 01:20:57,994
You know, i think i'm
gonna be staying alive,

1452
01:20:58,029 --> 01:20:59,996
'cause you can't catch
up with this jive.

1453
01:21:00,031 --> 01:21:03,766
Ha ha! Whoo!
And what? And what?

1454
01:21:03,802 --> 01:21:04,901
Uh-oh!

1455
01:21:16,081 --> 01:21:17,947
Yaaaa!

1456
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:26,923
Uuuh.

1457
01:21:31,896 --> 01:21:32,862
Darwin!

1458
01:21:32,897 --> 01:21:34,964
I'm ok, but i'm
not happy!

1459
01:21:43,775 --> 01:21:46,709
The pen is mightier
than the sword.

1460
01:21:52,584 --> 01:21:55,985
The pen is mightier
than two swords.

1461
01:21:56,021 --> 01:21:57,954
Aah!

1462
01:22:09,268 --> 01:22:12,902
Of course it's no match
for a fingernail.

1463
01:22:15,474 --> 01:22:16,839
Ok!

1464
01:22:25,984 --> 01:22:27,484
I gotcha now.

1465
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:33,923
Huh?

1466
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:42,965
Don't do it!

1467
01:22:43,001 --> 01:22:44,967
Don't do it!

1468
01:22:45,003 --> 01:22:45,968
Use 'em, fran!

1469
01:22:46,004 --> 01:22:49,972
Aaaaaahhhhhh!

1470
01:22:50,008 --> 01:22:50,973
Franny, no!

1471
01:22:51,009 --> 01:22:52,975
Franny, wait!

1472
01:22:53,011 --> 01:22:54,977
Franny?

1473
01:22:55,013 --> 01:22:57,947
Ooh! I'm getting old.

1474
01:22:57,982 --> 01:22:59,982
I'm getting so old,

1475
01:23:00,018 --> 01:23:03,920
i've even forgotten how
to rhyme anymore.

1476
01:23:03,955 --> 01:23:07,156
Oh, please.

1477
01:23:07,192 --> 01:23:10,159
Please, please,
franny, franny.

1478
01:23:10,195 --> 01:23:12,795
Oooooh!

1479
01:23:18,136 --> 01:23:20,937
Aaahhh! Aaah!

1480
01:23:20,972 --> 01:23:21,904
Aaaah!

1481
01:23:25,344 --> 01:23:28,645
Your temporalfuge,
it didn't work.

1482
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:31,581
Now i'll get you

1483
01:23:31,617 --> 01:23:33,983
and this imaginary jerk!

1484
01:23:34,018 --> 01:23:35,918
I'm not afraid of you!

1485
01:23:37,989 --> 01:23:38,955
I beg your pardon?

1486
01:23:38,990 --> 01:23:41,658
I'm not afraid of you!

1487
01:23:41,693 --> 01:23:42,992
I know who you are.

1488
01:23:43,027 --> 01:23:44,961
You can't scare me.

1489
01:23:44,996 --> 01:23:48,965
Really? Yaaaaaa!

1490
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,433
Francis!

1491
01:23:51,503 --> 01:23:53,970
Stop it, zoe!

1492
01:23:54,005 --> 01:23:56,139
Zoe? Who's zoe?

1493
01:23:56,174 --> 01:23:58,875
Only one person ever
called me franny.

1494
01:23:58,910 --> 01:24:01,878
It was hard for me to
admit it was you.

1495
01:24:03,915 --> 01:24:05,882
I didn't want it
to be my fault.

1496
01:24:11,523 --> 01:24:12,922
I'm sorry, zoe.

1497
01:24:12,957 --> 01:24:14,924
No!

1498
01:24:14,959 --> 01:24:16,893
Francis!

1499
01:24:37,683 --> 01:24:38,915
Zoe.

1500
01:24:47,992 --> 01:24:51,961
The boogeyman, a girl?

1501
01:24:51,996 --> 01:24:53,963
Get outta here! What
you doing a girl?

1502
01:24:53,998 --> 01:24:55,965
Larry! I thought
it was you!

1503
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,967
Long time no see, huh?

1504
01:24:58,002 --> 01:25:00,870
Hey, remember your car?

1505
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:03,673
Are you ok, darwin?

1506
01:25:03,709 --> 01:25:06,843
I'm got sock fuzz
in my mouth.

1507
01:25:07,779 --> 01:25:09,879
Francis?

1508
01:25:11,950 --> 01:25:14,917
Are you ok, francis? We
heard a strange noise.

1509
01:25:14,953 --> 01:25:18,154
Uh... i...

1510
01:25:18,189 --> 01:25:21,725
was vacuuming
under the bed.

1511
01:25:27,733 --> 01:25:29,932
You didn't change
the bag first.

1512
01:25:29,968 --> 01:25:32,902
Encouragement, michael, encouragement.

1513
01:25:33,972 --> 01:25:38,775
Francis, honey, we came
upstairs to apologize.

1514
01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:40,977
You father just logged
onto the internet news.

1515
01:25:41,012 --> 01:25:42,945
The same things that
were going on here,

1516
01:25:42,981 --> 01:25:45,715
just started happening
last night in centerville.

1517
01:25:45,751 --> 01:25:47,950
They think the same
people are responsible

1518
01:25:47,986 --> 01:25:50,253
but most important,

1519
01:25:50,288 --> 01:25:53,790
we know that you are
not responsible.

1520
01:25:53,825 --> 01:25:55,592
Oh, sweetheart,

1521
01:25:55,627 --> 01:25:58,961
we are so sorry that we
didn't believe you.

1522
01:25:58,997 --> 01:26:00,864
It's ok. It's ok, mom.

1523
01:26:02,434 --> 01:26:04,901
You were just looking for
a logical explanation.

1524
01:26:04,936 --> 01:26:07,670
It was the boogeyman.

1525
01:26:07,706 --> 01:26:09,906
Oh, please.

1526
01:26:09,941 --> 01:26:12,909
Darwin, you know there's no
such thing as the boogeyman.

1527
01:26:12,944 --> 01:26:13,910
Yeah, but i saw him,

1528
01:26:13,945 --> 01:26:15,912
with big, sharp
teeth and claws!

1529
01:26:15,947 --> 01:26:17,914
Darwin, it's past
your bedtime.

1530
01:26:17,949 --> 01:26:18,915
You tell 'em, darwin.

1531
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:20,917
You won't go
away, will you?

1532
01:26:20,952 --> 01:26:23,820
Well, of course she won't go away, honey.

1533
01:26:23,855 --> 01:26:24,921
She's your sister.

1534
01:26:24,956 --> 01:26:26,222
I'll be here whenever
you need me.

1535
01:26:26,257 --> 01:26:27,824
That's what
friends are for.

1536
01:26:27,859 --> 01:26:29,959
I'm glad i do believe
in you again.

1537
01:26:29,994 --> 01:26:32,361
I believe in you
too, francis.

1538
01:26:32,397 --> 01:26:36,466
Yes, honey,
we all do.

1539
01:26:38,002 --> 01:26:39,903
Goodnight, sweetheart.

1540
01:26:40,972 --> 01:26:42,739
Goodnight.

1541
01:26:44,208 --> 01:26:47,944
So what's the story on
the boogeyman here?

1542
01:26:47,979 --> 01:26:52,381
Actually, it's
boogey person.

1543
01:26:52,417 --> 01:26:55,985
Yeah? So who are you?

1544
01:26:56,020 --> 01:26:57,654
Personally?

1545
01:26:57,689 --> 01:26:58,955
This is zoe.

1546
01:26:58,990 --> 01:27:01,891
Zoe's my imaginary friend.

1547
01:27:01,927 --> 01:27:04,861
You told me you never had an imaginary friend.

1548
01:27:06,498 --> 01:27:07,797
She lied.

1549
01:27:07,833 --> 01:27:09,532
Wise up, lar.

1550
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:11,801
Just because you hang around
with a seven-year-old,

1551
01:27:11,837 --> 01:27:13,035
doesn't mean you
have to be naive.

1552
01:27:13,071 --> 01:27:15,905
Zoe and i used to play all the time when i was little.

1553
01:27:15,941 --> 01:27:19,909
When darwin got sick,
and we couldn't do anything to make him better,

1554
01:27:19,945 --> 01:27:22,879
that's when i decided
i had to grow up.

1555
01:27:24,048 --> 01:27:26,950
I just stopped believing
in what wasn't real.

1556
01:27:26,985 --> 01:27:29,819
And you started to turn
into a boogeyman?

1557
01:27:29,855 --> 01:27:31,921
Boogey person.

1558
01:27:31,957 --> 01:27:35,525
I'm so sorry i stopped
believing in you, zoe.

1559
01:27:36,962 --> 01:27:37,927
Shhh.

1560
01:27:37,963 --> 01:27:41,097
The guy inside his head.

1561
01:27:41,132 --> 01:27:43,933
That explains the echo.

1562
01:27:43,969 --> 01:27:45,902
On my way, big guy.

1563
01:27:45,937 --> 01:27:46,936
Gotta go, fran.

1564
01:27:46,972 --> 01:27:48,938
Go where?
Centerville.

1565
01:27:48,974 --> 01:27:49,939
You heard what
your dad said

1566
01:27:49,975 --> 01:27:51,941
about the weird things
going on over there.

1567
01:27:51,977 --> 01:27:54,911
They've got a boogeyman
who needs busting.

1568
01:27:56,982 --> 01:27:58,948
I'd better go with you.

1569
01:27:58,984 --> 01:28:01,518
I've seen you in
action, lar,

1570
01:28:01,553 --> 01:28:04,888
and i don't think you could handle
a full-tilt boogey by yourself.

1571
01:28:04,923 --> 01:28:06,923
You know what? I think
i liked you better

1572
01:28:06,958 --> 01:28:08,024
when you were a boogey--

1573
01:28:09,928 --> 01:28:11,661
person.

1574
01:28:11,696 --> 01:28:13,863
[Mumbling ñ

1575
01:28:20,371 --> 01:28:22,906
oh, it was wonderful to
see you again, franny.

1576
01:28:22,941 --> 01:28:24,908
I'm sorry for all the
trouble i caused.

1577
01:28:24,943 --> 01:28:26,609
I didn't want to
be a boogey.

1578
01:28:26,645 --> 01:28:27,911
I just couldn't
help it.

1579
01:28:27,946 --> 01:28:29,913
It's ok. Everything's
all right,

1580
01:28:29,948 --> 01:28:31,447
and we can be friends
again, just like before.

1581
01:28:34,953 --> 01:28:37,887
You won't be seeing
us anymore, franny.

1582
01:28:39,724 --> 01:28:41,925
Well, you told darwin
you wouldn't go away.

1583
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:44,761
She means we won't be
coming back to see you.

1584
01:28:44,796 --> 01:28:46,930
Oh, no, no.

1585
01:28:46,965 --> 01:28:48,932
Only real friends
last forever.

1586
01:28:48,967 --> 01:28:49,933
Like joanne.

1587
01:28:49,968 --> 01:28:52,368
But i believe in you.

1588
01:28:52,403 --> 01:28:54,236
I believe in both of you.

1589
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:57,173
The time to believe is when you're little,
like darwin.

1590
01:28:57,208 --> 01:28:58,942
When you still need us.

1591
01:28:58,977 --> 01:29:01,878
I don't want to
lose you again.

1592
01:29:01,913 --> 01:29:02,879
You won't lose
me, franny.

1593
01:29:02,914 --> 01:29:04,881
Not as long as
you remember me.

1594
01:29:04,916 --> 01:29:06,449
Fess up, fran?

1595
01:29:06,484 --> 01:29:09,018
You know you're too grown up
to have an imaginary friend.

1596
01:29:09,054 --> 01:29:10,853
Don't you?

1597
01:29:10,889 --> 01:29:11,854
Well, no.

1598
01:29:11,890 --> 01:29:13,856
I mean i can see you
guys right now,

1599
01:29:13,892 --> 01:29:15,357
and that proves,
logically, that--

1600
01:29:15,393 --> 01:29:18,828
excuse me.

1601
01:29:30,909 --> 01:29:32,875
You're not turning into
a boogeyman, anymore.

1602
01:29:32,911 --> 01:29:34,777
You don't need
sunglasses.

1603
01:29:34,813 --> 01:29:37,847
Yeah. But they
make me look cool.

1604
01:29:38,917 --> 01:29:39,882
Hey, fran...

1605
01:29:39,918 --> 01:29:41,884
maybe i am too grown up.

1606
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:43,653
Ah, fran...

1607
01:29:43,688 --> 01:29:46,122
just because you're
getting older,

1608
01:29:46,157 --> 01:29:48,157
doesn't mean you
have to get old.

1609
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:25,928
I can't sleep.
I'm kinda scared.

1610
01:30:25,964 --> 01:30:28,931
Climb in.

1611
01:30:28,967 --> 01:30:30,933
You know, the only way the
boogeyman can hurt you

1612
01:30:30,969 --> 01:30:32,935
is by making you afraid.

1613
01:30:32,971 --> 01:30:34,937
Yeah.

1614
01:30:34,973 --> 01:30:36,939
Francis...

1615
01:30:36,975 --> 01:30:37,940
uh-huh.

1616
01:30:37,976 --> 01:30:40,242
I'm not really scared
of the boogeyman.

1617
01:30:40,278 --> 01:30:42,645
And i saw how
you handled him.

1618
01:30:42,681 --> 01:30:45,948
I'm worried about
getting sick again.

1619
01:30:45,984 --> 01:30:49,952
Have you talked to
larry about it?

1620
01:30:49,988 --> 01:30:53,956
He said you
could help me.

1621
01:30:53,992 --> 01:30:57,860
That you could tell me how
grown-ups keep from being scared.

1622
01:30:57,896 --> 01:31:01,998
Well, i guess they know that
being afraid doesn't help.

1623
01:31:02,033 --> 01:31:04,901
Also, they don't
like being afraid.

1624
01:31:04,936 --> 01:31:07,904
It makes them
act afraid.

1625
01:31:07,939 --> 01:31:12,909
Kinda like pretending
you're not scared.

1626
01:31:12,944 --> 01:31:16,412
Yeah, i guess.

1627
01:31:16,447 --> 01:31:19,782
And pretty soon, you're
not afraid anymore.

1628
01:31:21,586 --> 01:31:23,920
I guess it takes a
lot of imagination

1629
01:31:23,955 --> 01:31:25,888
to become a
grown-up.

1630
01:31:27,959 --> 01:31:30,793
It sure does, sweetie.
