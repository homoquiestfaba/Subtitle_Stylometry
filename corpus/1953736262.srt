I watched them bury you.

531
00:45:44,167 --> 00:45:45,725
It's a long story.

532
00:45:46,247 --> 00:45:47,726
And my time is short.

533
00:45:48,127 --> 00:45:49,560
Are you here to kill
Red and his men?

534
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:53,198
Unless they kill me first.

535
00:45:53,927 --> 00:45:56,236
Well, I don't care if you
are the spawn of hell.

536
00:45:58,207 --> 00:45:59,401
I'll ride with you.

537
00:46:02,847 --> 00:46:04,758
It's personal.

538
00:46:09,007 --> 00:46:11,601
Red Cavanaugh murdered
my husband in cold blood.

539
00:46:12,287 --> 00:46:14,278
Ain't nothin' more
personal than that.

540
00:46:17,967 --> 00:46:20,322
You can dance
on his grave.

541
00:46:20,647 --> 00:46:23,002
But until I'm through,

542
00:46:23,087 --> 00:46:24,759
stay out of my way.

543
00:46:27,407 --> 00:46:29,204
Look, you may be good,
but they've got numbers.

544
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:33,806
Red hired up a lot of guns
since he took the town.

545
00:46:35,127 --> 00:46:36,606
Let us help.

546
00:46:38,287 --> 00:46:39,356
Us?

547
00:46:40,647 --> 00:46:43,798
We've been praying
for someone to bring
justice.

548
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:46,606
Been a year.
Nobody's come.

549
00:46:46,727 --> 00:46:48,524
No marshals,

550
00:46:48,607 --> 00:46:50,245
no law of any kind.

551
00:46:52,287 --> 00:46:54,437
And trust me,
we've sent letters,

552
00:46:54,527 --> 00:46:57,041
telegrams, we even
went to Denver.

553
00:46:58,527 --> 00:47:00,757
Seems like Red's got himself
some friends in high places.

554
00:47:02,167 --> 00:47:03,156
So you see,

555
00:47:06,127 --> 00:47:07,799
we gotta stick together.

556
00:47:08,447 --> 00:47:10,517
You don't hear too good,
do you, lady?

557
00:47:13,647 --> 00:47:15,877
Nobody can kill
them but me.

558
00:47:18,407 --> 00:47:19,635
Now,

559
00:47:19,727 --> 00:47:23,197
I suggest you clear out,
'cause they'll be back
sooner or later.

560
00:48:03,567 --> 00:48:05,319
Where the hell
is Baptiste?

561
00:48:05,767 --> 00:48:07,644
Was he a part of that
ruckus this morning?

562
00:48:08,527 --> 00:48:10,006
That man loves a fight.

563
00:48:11,327 --> 00:48:12,362
Dead, boss.

564
00:48:16,487 --> 00:48:17,715
Ramos, too.

565
00:48:21,007 --> 00:48:22,565

you talking about?

566
00:48:24,287 --> 00:48:26,084
I seen 'em boxed up.

567
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,446
All right, boys.

568
00:48:36,287 --> 00:48:38,357
Let's go pay
our respects, huh?

569
00:48:39,807 --> 00:48:42,321

Come on.

571

You from around here?

572
00:50:02,047 --> 00:50:03,480
Not exactly.

573
00:50:08,207 --> 00:50:09,879
Can I help you
with somethin'?
Leave the bottle.

574
00:50:10,287 --> 00:50:11,640
Yes, sir.

575
00:50:12,007 --> 00:50:13,565
Well, you know
what they say,

576
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:15,161
"If you're looking
for someone..."

577
00:50:15,447 --> 00:50:17,085
"Just head to the saloon."

578
00:50:23,607 --> 00:50:26,360
Expect it'll be getting
lively around here in
a while.

579

ones for?

580

fucking stupid?

we're gonna do.

is still half alive.

There are eternal

712

Give this town back to us

713

and you'll have the
rest of your life to
atone for the sins

714

you left behind.

down here, boys?

722
01:02:47,407 --> 01:02:48,999
I don't think
we can hit 100.

723
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,884
No, you gotta get
to 200, Washington,

724
01:02:51,127 --> 01:02:53,322
or you're gonna have
a large-size problem here.

All right,
everybody listen up,

726
01:02:58,767 --> 01:03:01,327
we're three months
behind on deliveries

727
01:03:01,447 --> 01:03:03,005
and he's coming to collect.

728
01:03:03,367 --> 01:03:06,325
He can help us hack it out
of the goddamned walls
if he wants.

729
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:08,284
We have nothing to hide.

730
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:11,040
Washington, he's the least
of our problems at this point.

the stranger's

Yeah, what I'm telling you

734
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,356
He's my brother.

743
01:04:00,007 --> 01:04:00,996
All right, he's here.

01:04:56,127 --> 01:04:57,242

754
01:04:57,327 --> 01:04:58,806
And you brought marshals.
Thank God.

757
01:05:04,487 --> 01:05:05,806
Hello, Cal.

758
01:05:06,567 --> 01:05:07,556
Yes,

759
01:05:08,447 --> 01:05:11,007
I think you should stay
down until all this
gets sorted out.

760
01:05:11,687 --> 01:05:14,485
Hey, limey!
I just came for Red.

761
01:05:14,567 --> 01:05:16,319
Why don't you come
and get your boy?
JUDAH: Red,

762
01:05:16,807 --> 01:05:19,924
is this the fellow that's
been putting your men
on display at the chapel?

763
01:05:20,007 --> 01:05:22,396
Yeah, but me and the boys
are taking care of it,
obviously.

764
01:05:22,487 --> 01:05:25,559
Really? Because just
the opposite appears
to be the case.

765
01:05:25,647 --> 01:05:28,115
I pay you to run this
operation and keep
our interests secure,

766
01:05:28,207 --> 01:05:30,243
which clearly they are not.
Which begs the question,

767
01:05:30,407 --> 01:05:31,999
where's my gold?

768
01:05:32,167 --> 01:05:33,520
Oh, you're gonna
get it, Judah.

769
01:05:33,607 --> 01:05:34,801
You're gonna get it.

770
01:05:34,887 --> 01:05:36,320
You're the one
protecting him?

771
01:05:37,007 --> 01:05:39,646
The federal courts were going
to let the mining rights
revert to Edendale.

772
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:42,195
So if I wanted control
of the mine,

773
01:05:42,567 --> 01:05:44,319
I simply needed
control of the town.

774
01:05:44,727 --> 01:05:47,605
Mr. Cavanaugh here
provides that control.

775
01:05:47,687 --> 01:05:49,598
And I...

776
01:05:50,727 --> 01:05:52,046
I pay off all
the right people.

777
01:05:53,287 --> 01:05:54,481
So,

778
01:05:54,567 --> 01:05:56,956
if I don't see every
ounce of my gold,

779
01:05:57,327 --> 01:05:58,919
I'll take my men

780
01:05:59,007 --> 01:06:01,396
and leave you in the
predicament in which
I found you.

781
01:06:01,927 --> 01:06:03,042

782
01:06:03,807 --> 01:06:04,956

for you.
