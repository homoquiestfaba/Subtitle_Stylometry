1
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:05,232
<i>My ears hear what others cannot hear.</i>

2
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:11,572
<i>Small, faraway things people
cannot normally see are visible to me.</i>

3
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,034
<i>These senses are the fruits
of a lifetime of longing.</i>

4
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,495
<i>Longing to be rescued.</i>

5
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,205
<i>To be completed.</i>

6
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:24,668
<i>Just as the skirt needs the wind to billow...</i>

7
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:28,589
<i>...I'm not formed by things
that are of myself alone.</i>

8
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:32,342
<i>I wear my father's belt
tied around my mother's blouse.</i>

9
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,555
<i>And shoes which are from my uncle.</i>

10
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:39,558
<i>This is me.</i>

11
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:47,149
<i>Just as a flower does not choose its color...</i>

12
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:51,486
<i>...we are not responsible
for what we have come to be.</i>

13
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,950
<i>Only once you realize this
do you become free.</i>

14
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,119
<i>And to become adult...</i>

15
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,914
<i>...is to become free.</i>

16
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:13,610
Happy Birthday

17
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,210
Happy Birthday India

18
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,392
Richard! No!

19
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,693
A family man...

20
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,738
...devoted husband to his wife, Evelyn...

21
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:01,491
...loving father to his daughter, India.

22
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:05,120
He was a model to our town...

23
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:09,166
...and of what it means to be a man
who walks through the world...

24
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:13,670
...with openness, honesty and integrity.

25
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,634
<i>-India?
-Richard Stoker was taken from us...</i>

26
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:20,344
...by a cruel twist of fate.

27
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:21,929
<i>India?</i>

28
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:25,766
The reasons for which
are unknown and unknowable.

29
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:29,311
By an accident
nobody would have predicted.

30
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:33,065
It would have been impossible
for even an outstanding architect...

31
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,650
<i>...like Richard...</i>

32
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,110
<i>...to understand God's
great design.</i>

33
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,082
India?

34
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,294
India.

35
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,133
The guests will be here soon.

36
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:03,011
Can you help
Mrs. McGarrick in the kitchen?

37
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:13,689
Please?

38
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,570
Don't do this to me, India.

39
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,363
Not today.

40
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,420
When they pried open his car...

41
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,298
-...you know, his body was burned--
-To a crisp.

42
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,091
Terrible accident.

43
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,177
Poor thing.
India was so close to her father.

44
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,971
-Who's gonna look after her?
-She's still got her mother.

45
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,349
Her mother look after her?
More like the other way around.

46
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:52,603
You know what?
This whole accident is so strange.

47
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,189
Have you heard
all the rumors floating around...?

48
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,944
You don't think he meant
to drive off the bridge?

49
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,572
-Why did he have to go two states away?
-I don't know.

50
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:07,242
-Everything all right?
-Yes, Mrs. McGarrick.

51
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:26,887
Now I'm wondering
if I kept them in the fridge too long.

52
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,058
What do you think?
Was I too stingy with the paprika?

53
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,232
Your deviled eggs remind me
of when I was a little girl.

54
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:44,029
Well, you may be all grown up,
but you still get eggshells all over the floor.

55
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,490
Have you outgrown your shoes?

56
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,665
Did you find your birthday present yet?

57
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,463
<i>I found the box, but it was empty.</i>

58
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,007
Are you sure?

59
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,884
Did you check?

60
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,512
Check again.

61
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,809
Every year I thought it was my father
who left me shoes on my birthday.

62
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,311
But all this time, it's been--

63
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,483
Tell me what it opens.

64
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,444
How would I know?

65
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:26,989
All right.

66
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,490
That was my brother....

67
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:37,457
You know, originally
they were part of a set of four...

68
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,710
...but then I broke one as a kid.

69
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:45,674
Now I'm seeing in this house
someone must have let another break.

70
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:46,925
No, it wasn't me.

71
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:51,763
When we-- When we moved in, it broke
as the housekeepers were unpacking it.

72
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:56,018
India. Come and say hello
to your Uncle Charlie.

73
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,736
<i>India? Come over.</i>

74
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,322
See you soon.

75
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:10,949
Hello, India.

76
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,162
Come on.

77
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,958
She hates to be touched.

78
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,127
I'm her mother.

79
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:24,004
What a curse.

80
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,674
You know, Charlie, Richard used to say...

81
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:30,385
...that we had lost you
to the rest of the world forever.

82
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:33,514
Why, India, you're white as a sheet.

83
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,766
Is something wrong?

84
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:39,686
Yes.

85
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:42,064
My father is dead.

86
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,101
<i>How beautiful.</i>

87
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:24,314
Richard was so proud of India's hunting
that he stuffed every single thing she killed.

88
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,402
What a tragic waste of life.

89
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,904
These live particularly deep in the forest.

90
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:33,407
They'd be very hard to catch.

91
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,745
I guess Richard and India were a good team.

92
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:53,760
It's kind of disrespectful, him not wearing
black to his own brother's funeral.

93
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:56,805
He must have come back today
from the Middle East or something.

94
00:09:56,889 --> 00:09:59,308
It's just part of a dig
in some old part of Istanbul?

95
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:02,895
No, I think he was digging for something
quite different. Gold in Indonesia.

96
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:06,064
I really want to thank you
for your words this morning.

97
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:09,401
Well, you and Richard deserve every word.

98
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,058
The wine's good.

99
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,879
There you are. Come and join us.

100
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,924
This is Richard's brother.

101
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,008
Hello.

102
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:16,635
-He's back.
-Nice to meet you.

103
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,804
These are the Blooms,
good friends of ours.

104
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,013
Good evening.

105
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:21,849
I didn't know Richard had a brother.

106
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:23,058
Nice to meet you.

107
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,977
We're sorry for your loss.

108
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,979
How did you know Richard?

109
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,071
Got his doctorate from Oxford
when he was 24.

110
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,739
Stoker sure had the brains.

111
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:40,158
Yeah. Just look at India.

112
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:46,456
Hello, again.

113
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:59,970
Do you want to know why
you feel at a disadvantage right now?

114
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:03,974
Because I didn't know
you existed until today?

115
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:07,019
Because you're standing below me.

116
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:39,092
You look like my father.

117
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,680
I am so sorry.

118
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,850
It's your loss too.

119
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,905
In about 60 seconds,
your mother's gonna tell you...

120
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:02,783
...that I'm gonna be
staying here for a while...

121
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,994
...but I want it to be your decision too.

122
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,789
Why?

123
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:12,209
Because...

124
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,254
...it's important to me.

125
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:58,172
This really is a beautiful garden.

126
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:02,467
The soil...

127
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,513
...is so soft.

128
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:08,557
Good for digging.

129
00:14:32,498 --> 00:14:35,626
I'm not exactly sure what you're driving at.

130
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:39,546
I don't want any trouble.

131
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,216
I am the only one
who would know anything about it.

132
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,551
I did everything you asked of me.

133
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:46,970
I kept you informed every year.

134
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:52,434
I was your eyes, your ears,
your hands all this time.

135
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:54,686
You're acting like you're in diapers now...

136
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:58,565
...and you've done this to me
ever since you were a child. I'm tired of it.

137
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,275
-I am tired of it.
-All right.

138
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:13,872
<i>Mrs. McGarrick?</i>

139
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:17,501
Mrs. McGarrick?

140
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,507
Where is she?

141
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,425
I haven't seen her yet.

142
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,428
Good morning.

143
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:31,890
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF
FUNERALS AND MOURNING

144
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,392
It's afternoon.

145
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,562
I guess it is.

146
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:39,606
Do you think you could--?

147
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:44,111
That's my girl. Thank you.

148
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,033
What are you doing today?

149
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:52,995
Thought I'd...

150
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:56,456
...draw the curtains, stop the clocks...

151
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,335
...cover the mirrors
and then retire to my room.

152
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:02,462
Don't be morbid.

153
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:05,215
Get rid of that dress. What is that?

154
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:07,301
It's my mourning attire.

155
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,679
Why don't we get out of here?

156
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,141
Go shopping.
We could get some ice cream.

157
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:18,312
In Victorian times, a widow was expected
to mourn her husband for two years.

158
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:20,314
At least.

159
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:22,524
-India.
-But in Ancient China...

160
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:27,529
...they built a straw hut beside the grave
and lived there for three years doing nothing.

161
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:31,116
You and me, ice cream, fresh air.

162
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,329
Come on, all these years
of hunting trips with him...

163
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:38,499
...and all I'm asking for
is one afternoon with me.

164
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,585
That's what your father would have wanted.

165
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:48,717
You know, your father and I
weren't always so distant.

166
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:52,179
I miss when he was...

167
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:55,933
...young.

168
00:18:10,883 --> 00:18:12,217
PASSPORT
United States of America

169
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:12,986
India!

170
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:17,157
India!

171
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,554
Mature aroma.

172
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:40,264
You chose a good year.

173
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:42,140
You can't compare it to a younger wine.

174
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:44,726
Too tannic.

175
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,979
Not ready to be open.

176
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:50,274
You should have come with us, India.
Oh, the open top...

177
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:53,569
...the air. It felt so good.

178
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:56,488
We stopped and Uncle Charlie
got some ice cream for you.

179
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:59,491
One chocolate, one vanilla.

180
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,326
Did I get it right?

181
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:04,121
I like the swirl kind.

182
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:08,625
You can make the swirl yourself,
you lazy thing.

183
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:11,044
Where's Mrs. McGarrick?

184
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:12,421
She's still not here.

185
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:14,756
What? What are we supposed to do?

186
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:18,093
I'm not much in the kitchen.

187
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:20,429
I can cook a little.

188
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:23,098
No, you don't have to do that.

189
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:24,433
I'd love to.

190
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:29,104
Charlie, who in the world are you?

191
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:34,651
India, would you take these
down to the freezer, please?

192
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:40,115
Do as your uncle tells you.

193
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:55,088
-Thank you.
-Thank you, India.

194
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:09,413
Too cold down there?

195
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,126
No.

196
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:36,356
You know, there was a time...

197
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:39,359
...Richard used to cook meals like this.

198
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:42,863
Wasn't there, India?

199
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:48,076
I'm sorry, of course.
That was before you were born.

200
00:22:51,163 --> 00:22:53,373
Where did you learn to cook like this,
Charlie?

201
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:55,876
Madame Jacquin.

202
00:22:56,293 --> 00:23:01,089
She ran a Michelin-starred restaurant
outside of Toulouse called "L'Institution."

203
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:04,676
A female chef.

204
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,930
In her opinion,
there was nothing a man could master...

205
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:10,015
...that a woman couldn't make.

206
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:11,934
What do you mean?

207
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:14,686
It sounds better in French.

208
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:19,233
Did I tell you on the way home?
Your French accent is perfect.

209
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:24,571
One of the perks of a first-class education.

210
00:23:24,655 --> 00:23:27,658
I could stay locked up in this house
for the rest of my life...

211
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:31,537
...yet still speak impeccable French.

212
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:35,624
I know you're not gonna spend
the rest of your life locked up in this house.

213
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:39,169
How do you spend your days?
I want to know my brother's wife.

214
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:45,050
Oh, I don't know where to start.

215
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:50,264
Charlie, you didn't even touch your food.

216
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:53,183
Did you put poison
in the food just for us girls?

217
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,145
But India ate everything.

218
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:00,941
Practically licked it clean.

219
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:07,906
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

220
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,742
Now, can I get you anything else?

221
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:13,579
Maybe some ice cream?

222
00:24:14,163 --> 00:24:15,414
No.

223
00:24:16,165 --> 00:24:18,041
"No, thank you."

224
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:22,087
I mean, no, thank you.

225
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:29,052
Would you like to
play something for us after dinner?

226
00:24:29,136 --> 00:24:31,013
I don't think so.

227
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:32,264
Would you?

228
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:34,057
India.

229
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:36,226
I mean, no, thank you.

230
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:46,528
Why didn't you tell me I had an uncle?

231
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:50,282
Because I barely knew about Charlie myself.

232
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:53,994
I mean, he's been traveling the world
for as long as I've known your father.

233
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:56,121
You know, he used to say to me:

234
00:24:56,538 --> 00:25:00,334
"What kind of family is family
that never comes home?"

235
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:05,047
Let's stop talking about Richard. Excuse me.

236
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:09,134
I'm sorry.

237
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:47,047
1994.

238
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:53,053
The year you were born.

239
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:30,841
What do you want from me?

240
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:32,676
To be friends.

241
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,021
We don't need to be friends.

242
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:49,359
We're family.

243
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:53,780
<i>It takes time to observe attentively.</i>

244
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,326
Wait for the moment that our eyes...

245
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:00,537
...finally penetrate the inside of the subject.

246
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:02,080
Look, Marv...

247
00:27:02,164 --> 00:27:04,541
...see that flower?
The way it just hangs there?

248
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:06,668
My eyes are penetrating
the inside of you.

249
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:11,048
Observe carefully
and you'll note that this plant....

250
00:27:14,593 --> 00:27:16,178
Check out Pitts.

251
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:19,097
I want you to really....

252
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:20,807
Hey.

253
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:26,230
Pitts.

254
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:28,106
Yes, Mr. Feldman?

255
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:31,401
Is there something you'd like to share
with the rest of the class?

256
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:33,737
Yeah, I've got something I'd like to share.

257
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,739
With India.

258
00:27:38,534 --> 00:27:40,202
MHS

259
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:57,594
He's gorgeous.

260
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:25,539
Hey.

261
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:30,335
Come back.

262
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:53,567
Mom?

263
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,220
It's going to rain.

264
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:51,959
Relax.

265
00:29:53,335 --> 00:29:54,878
There.

266
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:00,259
Curl your fingers.

267
00:30:02,845 --> 00:30:04,179
No.

268
00:30:04,263 --> 00:30:07,099
Watch me. You see?

269
00:30:11,395 --> 00:30:13,313
I'm teaching him piano.

270
00:30:13,397 --> 00:30:15,816
Uncle Charlie is a complete beginner.

271
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:19,152
Put on some dry clothes
and come play with us.

272
00:30:19,236 --> 00:30:24,158
Why don't you take a hot shower first
or you'll catch a coId. Come on. Here.

273
00:30:27,703 --> 00:30:29,705
Good morning, sweetie.

274
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:33,083
Charlie cleared off the court yesterday.

275
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:35,419
So we're just gonna walk on over.

276
00:30:36,253 --> 00:30:38,630
You don't want to come, do you?

277
00:30:38,714 --> 00:30:40,340
Hello, India.

278
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:43,385
I took one of Richard's belts.

279
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:46,096
His whites are a little big.

280
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:48,098
Ready?

281
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:49,641
Let's go.

282
00:30:59,193 --> 00:31:01,111
India?

283
00:31:02,988 --> 00:31:04,907
It's me.

284
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:07,826
Come and give your Auntie Gin a hug.

285
00:31:17,252 --> 00:31:21,423
-What time did you get in, Gwendolyn?
-Around 4.

286
00:31:21,715 --> 00:31:23,550
That's right.

287
00:31:24,968 --> 00:31:26,094
And when do you fly out?

288
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:31,183
That remains to be seen.

289
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:34,102
I'd originally planned
to stay for only a day or two...

290
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:38,023
...but now I'm thinking
I should stay a bit longer.

291
00:31:38,106 --> 00:31:40,400
Spend a little quality time with India.

292
00:31:42,945 --> 00:31:44,071
How nice for her.

293
00:31:46,323 --> 00:31:48,700
-Charles?
-Auntie Gin.

294
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:50,494
How long have you been here?

295
00:31:51,286 --> 00:31:53,038
Not long.

296
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:57,125
We're so grateful that he's taken time away
from his commitments in Europe.

297
00:31:58,168 --> 00:32:00,087
-Europe?
-Yes.

298
00:32:14,852 --> 00:32:20,566
Evie, dear, after dinner,
I was thinking perhaps you and I could talk.

299
00:32:21,108 --> 00:32:23,068
-We are talking.
-Alone.

300
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:26,071
-About what?
-Like Richard, for instance.

301
00:32:26,155 --> 00:32:28,448
-Richard?
-Yes, Evie. Richard.

302
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:30,325
My nephew, your late husband.

303
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:32,995
I don't think I'll be forgetting his name
any time soon.

304
00:32:33,078 --> 00:32:38,792
Of course not. I just thought
there might be arrangements to be made.

305
00:32:39,293 --> 00:32:41,461
Things to be settled.

306
00:32:41,545 --> 00:32:46,091
Our lawyer has said none of this has anything
to do with you. You're not in the will.

307
00:32:46,175 --> 00:32:49,636
No, dear, I mean something entirely different.

308
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:52,514
Like, for example...

309
00:32:52,598 --> 00:32:57,352
...maybe we could talk about
your living here with Charlie like this.

310
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:04,276
Auntie Gin isn't shy when it comes
to expressing her opinions about me.

311
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:08,071
Like when Richard asked me to marry him.
What Auntie Gin might be surprised...

312
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:11,992
...to learn is that those opinions
are neither wanted, needed, or appreciated.

313
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:14,369
-Evie--
-You come into my home and attack me...

314
00:33:14,453 --> 00:33:16,580
...at a time like this.

315
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:18,081
Evie--

316
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:27,674
I'm sure Auntie Gin didn't mean anything.

317
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:29,927
You didn't mean anything by it, did you?

318
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,720
No.

319
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:35,265
No, of course not, Evie dear.

320
00:33:35,933 --> 00:33:40,354
Now, would either of you two
like to play something for us after dinner?

321
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:42,981
-No, thank you.
-No, thank you.

322
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,820
Good night, Auntie Gin.

323
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:51,240
Don't mind Evie. She's just tired.

324
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:54,076
What was the name of your hotel again?

325
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:58,997
-The Biltmore.
-The Biltmore.

326
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:02,918
Maybe we could have breakfast together.

327
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:05,003
-Just us girls.
-Oh, I'm not sure.

328
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:09,174
-Can you take her to the Biltmore Hotel?
-I'll probably have a headache in the morning.

329
00:34:09,258 --> 00:34:13,178
-Drive carefully.
-Auntie Gin, stay the night here.

330
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:19,017
You made the evening much nicer.

331
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:21,645
Oh, thank you, dear.

332
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:27,359
But an old woman needs time on her own
to recover. Good night, sweet child.

333
00:34:29,194 --> 00:34:30,904
Call me.

334
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:43,167
Are there any other hotels in town
besides the Biltmore?

335
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:48,005
<i>Even family ties have no meaning
when food is scarce.</i>

336
00:34:48,088 --> 00:34:52,843
<i>This one knows there is no room
for his brother in the hunt.</i>

337
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:58,932
<i>While this sibling rivalry may seem cruel,
in the end, it is for the best.</i>

338
00:34:59,892 --> 00:35:03,478
<i>Each day in the hunt
brings the eagle closer to maturity.</i>

339
00:35:09,818 --> 00:35:10,944
<i>--and chicks of his own.</i>

340
00:35:11,028 --> 00:35:15,491
<i>The most patient of predators,
the black eagle can circle for hours...</i>

341
00:35:15,574 --> 00:35:18,785
<i>...waiting for the perfect moment to strike.</i>

342
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:23,624
<i>The fish will provide much needed
nourishment for her growing chicks.</i>

343
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:44,061
I was wondering
if anyone had turned in a cell phone.

344
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:48,565
I think I may have dropped it
when I was checking in.

345
00:35:49,149 --> 00:35:51,944
Are you absolutely certain?

346
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:59,451
All right. Oh, wait, wait.
What number do I have to press to dial out?

347
00:35:59,952 --> 00:36:02,746
Nine. Yes, I thought so.

348
00:36:49,835 --> 00:36:53,922
MOTEL

349
00:36:56,925 --> 00:36:58,802
PLEASE RING THE BELL
AT NIGHT

350
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,392
<i>Come on.</i>

351
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:08,937
<i>The mountains are no place
for the faint of heart.</i>

352
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:12,482
<i>The steep terrain and harsh climate
make a challenging climate...</i>

353
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:14,443
<i>...for even the strongest of species.</i>

354
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:24,620
<i>--wings are freedom.</i>

355
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:32,211
<i>--while the eagle prefers to find its own meals,
there is nothing wrong in having a little help.</i>

356
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:36,840
<i>Any advantage in nature is to be appreciated,
and what the left....</i>

357
00:37:39,176 --> 00:37:44,181
<i>--a hearty meal for the hungry bird
who lived to hunt another day.</i>

358
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:08,831
<i>--thirteen pounds
and a wingspan of nearly 7 feet.</i>

359
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:27,057
You said you were staying
at the Biltmore Hotel...

360
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,184
...and yet, here you are.

361
00:38:30,602 --> 00:38:32,271
I even had to call the cab company.

362
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:45,117
<i>--prey does not suspect
the hunter is circling high above...</i>

363
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:48,662
<i>...and is taken completely by surprise.</i>

364
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:42,049
-Hey, yo, yo. Look who's here.
-No kidding?

365
00:39:42,132 --> 00:39:45,052
-Is it--? Is it true?
-Is it?

366
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:46,887
MIDDLEBEND HIGH

367
00:39:51,517 --> 00:39:52,559
Yo, check this out.

368
00:39:53,143 --> 00:39:55,896
-I'm telling you, she can talk, bro.
-Well, let's find out.

369
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:58,732
-Oh, creepy, man.
-All right.

370
00:39:58,815 --> 00:40:00,567
Hey, Stoker.

371
00:40:09,743 --> 00:40:11,745
<i>-Hey, Stoker.
-Where you going?</i>

372
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:13,705
I'm talking to you.

373
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:17,501
Or do you go by Stroker now?

374
00:40:17,584 --> 00:40:20,212
<i>Because I hear
that's what your mom's been doing...</i>

375
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:22,297
<i>...to your uncle.</i>

376
00:40:23,632 --> 00:40:25,634
You been getting in on that?

377
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:29,972
What did you say?

378
00:40:30,055 --> 00:40:32,975
-She speaks.
-"What did you say?"

379
00:40:34,101 --> 00:40:36,228
I think you heard me, Stroker.

380
00:40:36,812 --> 00:40:38,021
Say that again?

381
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:45,237
All right. I think you'd better
watch your step, Stroker.

382
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:48,157
You know what happens
to little girls who mess with me?

383
00:40:49,074 --> 00:40:51,160
Watch this.

384
00:40:54,705 --> 00:40:55,789
What's up, bitch?

385
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:58,792
What's up?

386
00:41:10,554 --> 00:41:12,681
-Hey, come here, you all right?
-Oh, my God.

387
00:41:12,764 --> 00:41:14,141
You okay?

388
00:41:14,516 --> 00:41:17,561
All right, Pitts. That's enough.

389
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:18,812
Get out of here, Whip.

390
00:41:20,147 --> 00:41:23,108
Follow the bouncing ball, jackass.

391
00:41:23,192 --> 00:41:25,652
She's not interested.

392
00:41:28,071 --> 00:41:29,072
Dude, let's just go.

393
00:41:30,532 --> 00:41:34,036
Yeah, like I enjoy wasting my time
on this bitch, anyways. Let's go.

394
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:37,247
-Freak.
-Sorry about that.

395
00:41:37,331 --> 00:41:39,416
He's an A-hole, okay? Just ignore him.

396
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:43,128
Hey.

397
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,380
Where you going?

398
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:15,953
<i>Too cold down there?</i>

399
00:42:25,045 --> 00:42:28,173
<i>India, would you take these down
to the freezer, please?</i>

400
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:22,301
You stayed longer than I thought you would.

401
00:47:25,012 --> 00:47:28,182
You probably need to move on.

402
00:47:35,439 --> 00:47:37,524
You want me to leave?

403
00:47:42,863 --> 00:47:43,906
Come on.

404
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:47,326
You could return to Madame Jacquin.

405
00:47:58,629 --> 00:47:59,713
Dance with me.

406
00:48:02,966 --> 00:48:05,052
I always end up leading.

407
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:08,013
Well then, lead me, Evie.

408
00:48:26,448 --> 00:48:28,075
You know...

409
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:30,160
...for me...

410
00:48:30,994 --> 00:48:33,622
...it doesn't matter who you are.

411
00:48:34,248 --> 00:48:36,625
I feel the same.

412
00:48:38,877 --> 00:48:40,504
Really?

413
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:45,050
It doesn't matter who I am for me, either.

414
00:49:54,411 --> 00:49:55,454
Whip.

415
00:50:00,167 --> 00:50:01,793
Hey.

416
00:50:02,753 --> 00:50:04,546
I just thought I....

417
00:50:06,048 --> 00:50:08,133
I've never been here before.

418
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,594
Yeah, no kidding.

419
00:50:12,763 --> 00:50:15,224
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

420
00:50:15,516 --> 00:50:17,226
Have fun, bro.

421
00:50:29,154 --> 00:50:30,197
So....

422
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,492
You wanna go inside?

423
00:50:36,995 --> 00:50:39,706
Then where would you like to go?

424
00:50:48,131 --> 00:50:52,219
India Stoker,
Middlebend straight-A student...

425
00:50:52,302 --> 00:50:55,764
...hanging out in the parking lot at Rockets?

426
00:50:55,848 --> 00:50:58,016
Doesn't really seem like you.

427
00:50:58,725 --> 00:51:00,853
Not that you would know.

428
00:51:02,354 --> 00:51:06,900
Well, I.... I guess you're right. I wouldn't.

429
00:51:07,693 --> 00:51:09,903
It's just that....

430
00:51:09,987 --> 00:51:11,530
Yes.

431
00:51:12,406 --> 00:51:14,241
I know what you mean.

432
00:51:15,284 --> 00:51:16,785
Oh, yeah?

433
00:51:17,744 --> 00:51:19,204
How's that?

434
00:51:24,209 --> 00:51:26,378
Have you ever seen
a photograph of yourself...

435
00:51:27,379 --> 00:51:30,883
...taken when you didn't know
you're being photographed?

436
00:51:32,009 --> 00:51:35,512
From an angle you don't get to see
when you look in the mirror.

437
00:51:36,638 --> 00:51:39,266
And you think, "That's me.

438
00:51:40,058 --> 00:51:42,895
That's also me."

439
00:51:42,978 --> 00:51:44,438
Do you...?

440
00:51:45,105 --> 00:51:47,566
Do you know what I'm talking about?

441
00:51:48,984 --> 00:51:52,154
Yeah. I think I do.

442
00:51:58,827 --> 00:52:00,537
Well...

443
00:52:00,621 --> 00:52:03,081
...that's how I feel tonight.

444
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:07,336
So you're surprised at yourself?

445
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,973
You're not afraid of being touched anymore?

446
00:52:22,184 --> 00:52:24,311
Please don't spoil it.

447
00:53:11,233 --> 00:53:13,318
Holy shit.

448
00:53:13,777 --> 00:53:15,529
Everyone said you were crazy.

449
00:53:16,238 --> 00:53:19,032
But they have no idea, do they?

450
00:53:19,116 --> 00:53:21,285
I wanna go home now.

451
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:23,620
Let me go.

452
00:53:23,704 --> 00:53:25,164
No, you don't.

453
00:53:25,247 --> 00:53:29,001
You opened this door,
and now you're gonna walk through it.

454
00:53:36,425 --> 00:53:38,051
Quiet.

455
00:53:39,052 --> 00:53:40,888
Hold still.

456
00:53:40,971 --> 00:53:43,307
This is not gonna hurt.

457
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:45,392
Shit, what--?

458
00:53:47,561 --> 00:53:48,896
Stop, stop, stop.

459
00:53:48,979 --> 00:53:51,148
I broke my--

460
00:53:51,482 --> 00:53:55,444
Glad I borrowed your dad's belt.
Mine would've been way too short.

461
00:53:55,527 --> 00:53:58,071
-Shit--
-All yours.

462
00:53:58,155 --> 00:54:01,533
-I'm seriously hurt. Shit.
-Shut up.

463
00:54:24,139 --> 00:54:26,016
India, stop.

464
00:54:27,351 --> 00:54:28,894
India.

465
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:31,939
Stop. Stop.

466
00:56:07,451 --> 00:56:09,495
I'll kill you.

467
00:56:12,581 --> 00:56:14,249
I don't give a fuck--

468
00:57:15,477 --> 00:57:17,146
CALL ME!!!

469
00:59:27,067 --> 00:59:28,694
Yes?

470
00:59:33,699 --> 00:59:35,159
Can I come in?

471
00:59:38,495 --> 00:59:40,455
Well, what time is it?

472
00:59:55,179 --> 00:59:57,347
Would you brush my hair?

473
00:59:59,141 --> 01:00:01,560
I was just going to bed.

474
01:00:05,063 --> 01:00:07,191
Then I'll brush yours.

475
01:00:11,111 --> 01:00:14,114
You're wearing the nightgown I bought you.

476
01:00:18,619 --> 01:00:21,997
Tonight I felt like wearing something silk.

477
01:00:22,539 --> 01:00:26,418
Now that I think about it,
I never brushed your hair...

478
01:00:27,085 --> 01:00:28,712
...did I?

479
01:00:29,046 --> 01:00:30,506
You were busy.

480
01:00:33,759 --> 01:00:34,927
With what?

481
01:00:36,094 --> 01:00:37,095
I don't know.

482
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:40,682
You and your father
were always on your hunting trips.

483
01:00:40,766 --> 01:00:45,562
How could I compete with all of those
dead birds you constantly brought home?

484
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:02,162
I saw you in the dining room today.

485
01:01:03,622 --> 01:01:05,999
I don't know what you think you saw...

486
01:01:08,043 --> 01:01:10,254
...but nothing happened.

487
01:01:12,172 --> 01:01:15,717
You were so still,
I never even heard you there.

488
01:01:15,801 --> 01:01:18,095
Dad taught me that.

489
01:01:20,013 --> 01:01:21,682
Hunting.

490
01:01:25,018 --> 01:01:27,104
To wait.

491
01:01:30,274 --> 01:01:32,568
<i>In silence.</i>

492
01:01:37,364 --> 01:01:39,908
<i>We wouldn't need food or drink.</i>

493
01:01:41,076 --> 01:01:43,120
<i>We would watch everything.</i>

494
01:01:44,121 --> 01:01:47,249
<i>The patterns of tree branches
spreading out...</i>

495
01:01:48,417 --> 01:01:51,795
<i>...the thousands of shapes clouds make.</i>

496
01:01:52,671 --> 01:01:56,008
<i>I could count the number of leaves on a tree
in five hours.</i>

497
01:02:02,139 --> 01:02:05,309
<i>I always thought Dad liked hunting.</i>

498
01:02:05,559 --> 01:02:07,394
<i>But tonight I realized he did it for me.</i>

499
01:02:09,938 --> 01:02:12,983
<i>He used to say, "Sometimes
you need to do something bad...</i>

500
01:02:13,066 --> 01:02:16,236
<i>...to stop you from doing something worse."</i>

501
01:02:33,837 --> 01:02:38,091
Tomorrow, I'm gonna go
to the hairdresser...

502
01:02:38,175 --> 01:02:41,345
...after I clean out your father's study.

506
01:05:20,671 --> 01:05:22,756
<i>Dear India, happy birthday.</i>

507
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:26,051
<i>You are 5 years old today.
I wish I could be there for your party...</i>

508
01:05:26,134 --> 01:05:29,721
<i>...but your uncle is far away in Africa
taking pictures for the magazine.</i>

509
01:05:29,805 --> 01:05:32,641
<i>Dearest India, I'm writing this letter to you
from Florence.</i>

510
01:05:32,724 --> 01:05:36,019
<i>Yesterday, I circled Michelangelo's David
for hours. He carries a sling.</i>

511
01:05:36,103 --> 01:05:38,480
<i>His belted weapon over his left shoulder.</i>

512
01:05:38,564 --> 01:05:41,942
<i>-You are my dearest and only niece.
-My silent and invisible partner.</i>

513
01:05:42,025 --> 01:05:45,070
<i>And these are the lessons for you
in our many chapters together.</i>

514
01:05:45,154 --> 01:05:47,030
<i>-Dear India.
-Happy birthday again.</i>

515
01:05:47,114 --> 01:05:49,074
<i>I've missed your first teeth coming out.</i>

516
01:05:49,158 --> 01:05:53,704
<i>I'll never see the holes in your smile or how
they will fill in as you mature into a young lady.</i>

517
01:05:53,787 --> 01:05:57,875
<i>Greetings from Saint-Ètienne, where everyone
I meet insists on kissing both cheeks.</i>

518
01:05:57,958 --> 01:06:01,920
<i>-This custom of hugging and kissing.
-I think you, too, would find this uncomfortable.</i>

519
01:06:02,004 --> 01:06:05,007
<i>If I found it was you in an embrace,
I could make an exception.</i>

520
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:07,467
<i>-I wonder if you would, too.
-Happy Valentine's.</i>

521
01:06:07,551 --> 01:06:09,178
<i>-Happy Halloween.
-Merry Christmas.</i>

522
01:06:09,261 --> 01:06:12,723
<i>-Though I never receive a letter....
-I see your messages in the stars.</i>

523
01:06:12,806 --> 01:06:14,016
<i>Or in the music I hear.</i>

524
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:18,187
<i>It is a whistling tune from a lonely man
wandering in a foreign land.</i>

525
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:21,315
<i>I sense things so acutely
until it becomes almost too much.</i>

526
01:06:21,398 --> 01:06:23,942
<i>I wonder if for you, too,
life is made difficult by--</i>

527
01:06:24,026 --> 01:06:28,071
<i>The fact that you can hear what others
cannot hear, see what they cannot see.</i>

528
01:06:28,155 --> 01:06:31,617
<i>I know that someday you'll be very special,
India, and you already are.</i>

529
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:35,120
<i>-I know inside you feel some loneliness.
-Because you are the only one.</i>

530
01:06:35,204 --> 01:06:39,082
<i>Please know that I am with you
as we share the same blood.</i>

531
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:45,088
<i>Tonight, I'll fall asleep as I try to imagine
that you'll grow up and take over our name.</i>

532
01:06:46,006 --> 01:06:47,799
<i>How I want to meet you.</i>

533
01:06:47,883 --> 01:06:51,678
<i>-All my love, Charlie.
-All my love, Charlie.</i>

534
01:07:27,923 --> 01:07:29,508
Crawford Institute
Box 6292 Crawford, PA 19086

535
01:07:45,774 --> 01:07:46,942
Happy Birthday

536
01:08:13,051 --> 01:08:16,346
<i>You've reached the Middlebend Sheriff's
Department non-emergency number.</i>

537
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:20,684
<i>If this is an emergency,
please hang up and dial 911.</i>

538
01:08:20,767 --> 01:08:24,980
<i>Otherwise, please hold
for the next available operator.</i>

539
01:08:27,483 --> 01:08:30,694
<i>Middlebend Sheriff's Department,
how may I help you?</i>

540
01:08:31,111 --> 01:08:32,779
<i>Hello?</i>

541
01:08:32,863 --> 01:08:34,448
<i>Hello?</i>

542
01:08:34,531 --> 01:08:36,074
<i>Hello?</i>

543
01:08:45,209 --> 01:08:49,046
My father had the exact same sunglasses.

544
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:58,931
He wore them only when he was driving
so they were always in the glove compartment.

545
01:09:00,641 --> 01:09:04,311
Now I suppose they're all melted up,
along with the rest of the car.

546
01:09:05,103 --> 01:09:07,356
Please leave before my mother wakes up.

547
01:09:09,191 --> 01:09:12,277
Aren't you curious
about what happened to Richard?

548
01:09:14,488 --> 01:09:16,949
I'm curious
about what happened to Jonathan.

549
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:25,833
<i>That's an inseparable part
of what happened to Richard.</i>

550
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:30,212
<i>Richard was completely taken with Jonathan.</i>

551
01:09:30,295 --> 01:09:34,967
<i>That summer, Jonathan had just learned
how to climb the stairs.</i>

552
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:36,635
<i>Let's go again. Let's go.</i>

553
01:09:36,718 --> 01:09:40,472
<i>He couldn't resist climbing any staircase
he came across.</i>

554
01:10:53,879 --> 01:10:58,133
<i>It's been 20 years since your family
donated this building to Crawford.</i>

555
01:10:58,217 --> 01:11:02,012
It may look old now,
but Charlie's room is still very comfortable.

556
01:11:02,721 --> 01:11:05,933
As you know,
he was the one who wanted to stay here.

557
01:11:06,016 --> 01:11:09,394
And he insisted on being discharged
on this day.

558
01:11:09,478 --> 01:11:11,063
Today.

559
01:11:12,689 --> 01:11:13,774
Welcome to my home.

560
01:11:16,902 --> 01:11:19,029
Away from home.

561
01:11:35,587 --> 01:11:37,714
Until we meet again.

562
01:11:47,808 --> 01:11:49,351
I'm so proud of you.

563
01:12:25,179 --> 01:12:28,015
It always was your favorite car.

564
01:12:31,602 --> 01:12:34,938
I think you're gonna love New York.

565
01:12:35,606 --> 01:12:37,232
I got you your own apartment.

566
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:41,111
You see?

567
01:12:42,446 --> 01:12:44,698
Aren't we going to your house?

568
01:12:45,657 --> 01:12:47,993
Everything you need is in here.

569
01:12:50,287 --> 01:12:52,039
Why aren't we going to your place?

570
01:12:56,502 --> 01:12:57,920
I'm not gonna see India?

571
01:12:58,003 --> 01:12:59,171
Here are the keys.

572
01:12:59,254 --> 01:13:01,965
I think you'll see that I've taken care of
all the details.

573
01:13:03,091 --> 01:13:04,384
<i>Why are you doing this to me?</i>

574
01:13:04,468 --> 01:13:08,555
Do I really have to tell you something
you already know?

575
01:13:08,889 --> 01:13:10,724
Why can't I go?

576
01:13:10,808 --> 01:13:12,768
Charlie.

577
01:13:12,851 --> 01:13:14,394
Why not?

578
01:13:19,691 --> 01:13:21,360
Tell me.

579
01:13:23,862 --> 01:13:25,113
You listen very carefully.

580
01:13:25,197 --> 01:13:27,449
This is the most important thing.

581
01:13:28,116 --> 01:13:32,496
-If anything happens, you must call--
-You still love me, don't you, Richie?

582
01:13:34,373 --> 01:13:37,960
Yes, of course, I love you, Charlie.

583
01:13:40,587 --> 01:13:45,259
I just have to love you a little less now.
I can't have you--

584
01:13:45,342 --> 01:13:48,971
Near my India, my family.

585
01:13:49,054 --> 01:13:50,222
And I said:

586
01:13:50,889 --> 01:13:53,058
But I'm your family.

587
01:13:55,144 --> 01:13:58,230
What kind of family
is family you can't take home?

588
01:13:58,939 --> 01:14:01,150
-Jesus.
-Excuse me.

589
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,946
Jesus, Charlie.

590
01:14:30,888 --> 01:14:32,556
Are you okay?

591
01:14:33,932 --> 01:14:36,059
<i>I'm fine, Richie.</i>

592
01:14:37,478 --> 01:14:38,770
<i>I'm fine now.</i>

593
01:14:40,898 --> 01:14:42,316
Thank you for asking.

594
01:14:58,415 --> 01:14:59,458
Charlie?

595
01:15:03,003 --> 01:15:04,004
Oh, Charlie.

596
01:15:16,934 --> 01:15:19,812
Of course, I still love you, Richard.

597
01:15:21,021 --> 01:15:24,316
I just have to love you a little bit less now.

598
01:15:39,998 --> 01:15:41,875
<i>Why now?</i>

599
01:15:44,002 --> 01:15:45,254
Why come back now?

600
01:15:54,221 --> 01:15:56,431
The day I left Crawford...

601
01:15:56,932 --> 01:15:58,892
...the day your father had his accident...

602
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:01,979
...what day was it, do you remember?

603
01:16:02,062 --> 01:16:03,730
Yes.

604
01:16:05,274 --> 01:16:07,025
I remember.

605
01:16:07,568 --> 01:16:08,986
What day was it?

606
01:16:11,405 --> 01:16:14,116
It was my 18th birthday.

607
01:16:23,917 --> 01:16:25,085
I was waiting.

608
01:16:26,211 --> 01:16:27,963
For you.

609
01:16:28,338 --> 01:16:29,798
Everything I've ever done.

610
01:16:31,925 --> 01:16:33,385
For you, India.

611
01:18:05,435 --> 01:18:07,896
Happy birthday, India.

612
01:18:16,071 --> 01:18:17,739
Yes, sheriff.

613
01:18:17,823 --> 01:18:21,577
I was hungry,
so I stopped by Rockets for some fries.

614
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:26,582
I bumped into Whip at the parking lot
and we decided to go for a walk.

615
01:18:26,665 --> 01:18:29,710
At night? Those woods are dangerous.

616
01:18:29,793 --> 01:18:32,045
Oh, I wasn't scared.

617
01:18:32,129 --> 01:18:34,047
Not with Whip there.

618
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:37,009
He's so strong.

619
01:18:38,135 --> 01:18:39,511
I see.

620
01:18:41,513 --> 01:18:46,185
So we had a very nice time.

621
01:18:49,563 --> 01:18:51,023
And then?

622
01:18:51,482 --> 01:18:54,109
And then I went home.

623
01:18:54,985 --> 01:18:57,446
I thought Whip said
he was heading home too.

624
01:18:57,529 --> 01:19:00,032
Any idea what time that was?

625
01:19:00,491 --> 01:19:02,618
Well, that was....

626
01:19:04,077 --> 01:19:06,079
When did you eat the fries?

627
01:19:08,081 --> 01:19:09,082
Excuse me?

628
01:19:09,166 --> 01:19:12,419
Well, you said you went there
because you were hungry?

629
01:19:12,503 --> 01:19:19,176
And then, that is, after having a nice time,
you would have become even more hungry...

630
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:22,930
...and if you went to eat some fries...

631
01:19:23,013 --> 01:19:27,017
...I could find some people that can remember
what time they saw you.

632
01:19:28,227 --> 01:19:29,895
I think I--

633
01:19:30,187 --> 01:19:32,022
I think I must have been--

634
01:19:32,105 --> 01:19:33,899
I must have been blushing.

635
01:19:33,982 --> 01:19:36,985
It was my first time outside with a boy.

636
01:19:37,069 --> 01:19:39,488
I didn't want to be seen.

637
01:19:39,571 --> 01:19:41,865
It was 8:30 when you came home.

638
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:45,077
<i>II Trovatore was playing on PBS.</i>

639
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:48,956
Yeah, when I came home,
my uncle was watching T.V...

640
01:19:49,039 --> 01:19:51,208
...so l watched it with him.

641
01:19:52,251 --> 01:19:53,710
Just one moment.

642
01:19:53,794 --> 01:19:58,298
<i>II Trovatore.</i>

643
01:19:58,382 --> 01:20:00,968
What is it? It's a foreign movie?

644
01:20:01,051 --> 01:20:04,346
No. No, it's an opera by Verdi.

645
01:20:04,763 --> 01:20:07,516
-Would you like me to write it down?
-I'm fine.

646
01:20:08,517 --> 01:20:10,144
I do hope Whip's okay.

647
01:20:10,227 --> 01:20:12,312
Well, his folks are a mess.

648
01:20:12,396 --> 01:20:16,817
Then again, I have a feeling that he'll turn up.

649
01:20:17,067 --> 01:20:18,986
Boys that age....

650
01:20:19,611 --> 01:20:20,988
Well, you know how they are.

651
01:20:21,071 --> 01:20:23,157
I'm sure I do.

652
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,909
You will let me know if you hear anything,
won't you?

653
01:20:25,993 --> 01:20:27,286
Will do.

654
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:29,997
Okay.

655
01:20:30,414 --> 01:20:32,624
Well, I'll be in touch.

656
01:20:32,708 --> 01:20:33,876
Goodbye, sheriff.

657
01:20:33,959 --> 01:20:35,836
Goodbye, sheriff.

658
01:20:43,719 --> 01:20:49,391
Oh, by the way, did your housekeeper
ever get in touch after leaving town so quick?

659
01:20:53,103 --> 01:20:54,646
No.

660
01:20:55,689 --> 01:20:57,232
She didn't.

661
01:20:57,774 --> 01:21:02,779
Strange how people
can just disappear on you.

662
01:21:15,542 --> 01:21:17,377
He'll be back.

663
01:21:20,172 --> 01:21:22,216
What are we going to do?

664
01:21:23,717 --> 01:21:29,181
I think we'll really love New York.

665
01:21:37,606 --> 01:21:39,566
When do we leave?

666
01:22:00,045 --> 01:22:01,964
I'm sorry.

667
01:22:09,096 --> 01:22:10,681
Tomorrow night.

668
01:23:29,676 --> 01:23:34,139
-Should we do it again?
-I'm hungry. Let's eat first.

669
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:48,570
You know, I've often wondered
why it is we have children in the first place.

670
01:23:50,113 --> 01:23:53,492
And the conclusion I've come to is...

671
01:23:55,911 --> 01:24:00,749
...at some point in our lives,
we realize things are....

672
01:24:00,833 --> 01:24:03,710
They're screwed up beyond repair.

673
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:08,382
So we decide to start again.

674
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:12,010
Wipe the slate clean.

675
01:24:13,137 --> 01:24:14,972
Start afresh.

676
01:24:18,142 --> 01:24:20,227
And we have children.

677
01:24:21,854 --> 01:24:27,067
Little carbon copies we can turn to and say,
"You will do what I could not.

678
01:24:28,068 --> 01:24:31,780
You will succeed where I have failed."

679
01:24:34,074 --> 01:24:37,911
Because we want someone
to get it right this time.

680
01:24:45,085 --> 01:24:47,212
But not me.

681
01:24:52,050 --> 01:24:57,723
Personally speaking,
I can't wait to watch life tear you apart.

682
01:25:07,733 --> 01:25:09,485
India...

683
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,157
...who are you?

684
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:21,705
You were supposed to love me, weren't you?

685
01:25:46,897 --> 01:25:48,857
Come up to my room, please.

686
01:25:51,026 --> 01:25:53,570
I enjoyed your performance.

687
01:26:00,285 --> 01:26:03,121
India, go and pack a small bag.

688
01:26:03,205 --> 01:26:05,999
We'll be leaving shortly.

689
01:26:41,076 --> 01:26:42,578
I....

690
01:26:44,413 --> 01:26:46,665
I came to say goodbye.

691
01:26:47,332 --> 01:26:49,168
I can't allow you to do this.

692
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,003
Why not?

693
01:26:57,217 --> 01:27:02,514
There are little things one notices
along the way, but one suppresses because....

694
01:27:03,599 --> 01:27:04,683
Because?

695
01:27:05,934 --> 01:27:07,895
Why do you think?

696
01:27:10,939 --> 01:27:11,982
Love?

697
01:27:14,902 --> 01:27:16,904
Richard loved India.

698
01:27:18,322 --> 01:27:21,366
He would never have driven
so far away on her birthday.

699
01:27:21,992 --> 01:27:27,164
Not unless, for some reason he was called
away by someone he couldn't say no to.

700
01:27:29,875 --> 01:27:32,836
Auntie Gin
wanted to speak to me about you...

701
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:36,340
...but she never did come back after that night,
did she?

702
01:27:39,176 --> 01:27:43,388
People disappear...

703
01:27:44,223 --> 01:27:46,225
...all the time.

704
01:28:07,830 --> 01:28:12,584
Have me instead,
but stay away from my daughter.

705
01:28:13,001 --> 01:28:14,503
She's of age.

706
01:28:14,586 --> 01:28:16,129
Of age for what?

707
01:28:16,797 --> 01:28:22,761
To live in this house on her own
while her mother finally travels the world.

708
01:28:22,845 --> 01:28:25,055
Don't you want to speak French in France?

709
01:28:26,974 --> 01:28:29,143
What are you suggesting?

710
01:28:39,069 --> 01:28:40,904
Come with me.

711
01:29:39,379 --> 01:29:40,547
India.

712
01:29:40,631 --> 01:29:42,049
India, come here and look.

713
01:29:51,225 --> 01:29:54,311
India, come here.

714
01:30:00,067 --> 01:30:02,986
India! Come here! Now!

715
01:32:46,942 --> 01:32:48,652
In a hurry?

716
01:32:49,903 --> 01:32:52,072
Know how fast you were going?

717
01:32:56,160 --> 01:32:57,911
Pardon?

718
01:33:02,166 --> 01:33:05,502
Effectively fast, Mister Sheriff.

719
01:33:09,590 --> 01:33:11,758
Effective for what?
