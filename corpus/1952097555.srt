1
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:04,323
Anyideawhy all thetraffic?

2
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:06,688
Construction, probably.

3
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,038
I'm sorry I'm so late. Traffic.

4
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,745
I hope you don't mind, I took the liberty of ordering
Bratwurst

5
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,785
for everyone. You know what they say about sausage...

6
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,616
Why don't we pass everything around and everyone

7
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,347
just help themselves.

8
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:16,291
-These are great numbers.
-Great numbers

9
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,054
You are confident they'll be accepted?

10
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,562
-Absolutely.
-Good answer

11
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:26,806
Great numbers - 15 percent, 24 percent, 32 percent.

12
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,770
Just great, don't you agree?

13
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,433
Absolutely, we were just saying they are great numbers.

14
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,772
And we've got the right people where we need them.

15
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,848
No one is going to want to be a spoil-sport, all the players

16
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:40,679
even the foreign policy guys, everybody benefits too much

17
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,548
to throw a wrench into this one.

18
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,417
As you may have heard, there has been
some trouble in that area of the country.

19
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:49,688
Misunderstandings really, but Jack here -

20
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:53,821
His group wants to make sure that we
have everything under control.

21
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,092
We do, right?

22
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:58,634
-Absolutely.
-So, we're all friends here...

23
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:02,502
One last time because Jack hasn't been present in the past

24
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:06,338
and he needs to hearthis. Before we send these out-

25
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,338
Is there anything you want to tell us that is not in the
report?

26
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,286
No.

27
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:21,288
I'm glad to hear that. The level of
exposure were anything to go wrong

28
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,088
would be unacceptable.

29
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:29,962
Our position on this one is you break
it you're on your own to fix it.

30
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:06,401
Take me to the office.

31
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,913
I'm finished. You can lock up.

32
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,671
Buenas noches.

33
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,328
Wait, hold on.

34
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,802
-I gottta take this. What's up?
-We've got a problem

35
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,270
IMF, World Bank- everyone somehow
got the wrong numbers

36
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,273
Do they know the source?

37
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,811
No, but we do..

38
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,776
Theywere sent out electronically
by the guy you trust so much.

39
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,849
The one with the unbelievably good numbers.

40
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,948
Oh, and get this - attached to the
email with the numbers shock

41
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,112
was a short video clip.
It shows what happened to the locals

42
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,417
who were having trouble understanding us.

43
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,520
On this one, the really good numbers
guy really fixed ourwagon.

44
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,959
Unless right now you say otherwise
I'm gonna buy some art.

45
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:28,870
I'll buy some art

46
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,539
So why did you want to see me here?

47
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,947
Is this about my gallery's fee?

48
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,961
Saw your annual coverwith my painting on it.

49
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,557
What did you think?

50
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:56,794
Thought it looked good.

51
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,298
Made it look like you guys weren't
just a bunch of scum bags.

52
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:09,779
I've noticed from the society pages
you've been spending a lot of time

53
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,076
with that expensive girlfriend.

54
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:19,154
Does she know your career peaked a
year afteryou got out of school?

55
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,189
Maybe she'd find it romantic if
you were broke. You want to find out?

56
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:31,336
Which brings us to my original question.

57
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,104
To what do I owe the honor?

58
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:39,474
We've got another situation where
we need someone like you.

59
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:45,272
Someone with roots in the community.

60
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:56,787
We'll take them all.

61
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:39,205
-So what does my lawyer say?
-You'll have to let me handle this

62
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:39,899
-OK

63
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,465
You don't need surround-sound on this, you know

64
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,304
=You'll have to drive.
-I'll have to drive?!

65
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,447
Yeah, I got a place in Red Hook where we can do it

66
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:50,579
Does the guy I'm driving know what he's doing?

67
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,717
Absolutely

68
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:05,864
Hey, soldier, get your photo taken

69
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:23,733
Did you think you'd get awaywith it?

70
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,672
No, I knew I'd get a call like this one

71
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,037
So leave this world with a little dignity.
Be in Red Hook at midnight

72
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,578
-Tell them I need a couple of weeks.
-A couple of weeks?!

73
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:37,346
Yes. Tell him I can make it more
easyfor him down the road

74
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:41,482
when I'm gone or more difficult,
depending upon what I leave

75
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,150
for people to find.

76
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:48,125
Tell him I want to make a deal
for two more weeks, then,

77
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,768
as he's requested,
I'll meet him in Red Hook.

78
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,935
I'll get back to you.

79
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:35,772
-Hello?
-Is this Detective Turlotte?

80
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:36,915
Who's this?

81
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:42,380
Detective Turlotte, I would like
to engage your professional services.

82
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,683
Will you call me at my office on Monday,
I'm in the yellow pages.

83
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,155
Have a good day.

84
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,716
-Hello?
-I'll pay you five times-

85
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,754
-your advertised rate starting
immediately. Two weeks.

86
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,515
That's all, then you're done.

87
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,286
Two weeks? That's all?
Yes.

88
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:26,056
And it's not your agency I want to hire,
Detective Turlotte, it's you.

89
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:29,929
Do I know you? Is that why you're
using that Dick Tracey device?

90
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:33,295
Right to the point, good.
We have so little time

91
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:36,873
Regrettably, I must keep
my identity a secret.

92
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:41,638
It's nothing personal. It is a question
of unacceptable risk.

93
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,977
What I suggest is that I be called
"John Doe."

94
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,744
-Oh boy.
-It's very simple really

95
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,754
if you knew my situation you'd understand my calculations

96
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,983
I want you to keep an eye on someone. Watch him.

97
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:58,159
Tell me what you see.

98
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,456
-What, he run off with yourwife?
-No, it's nothing like that

99
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:05,871
Let's just say he's planning an event
that will be disadvantageous to me.

100
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:10,604
-What's this guy's profession?
-He's a kind of hired gun

101
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:14,939
with a lot of blood on his hands.
That's all I can say right now.

102
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:21,150
No, no, I must also tell you to
watch out, Detective Turlotte.

103
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:25,351
Your life could possibly be in
danger and I'm sorry about that.

104
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:30,154
I'm just an eye, that's all I am, an eye.

105
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:33,525
I know a lot of good ears, why don't you let me partner with
a good ear?

106
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:37,533
No. I understand your limitations and I want you, Frank.

107
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,296
Here's the contact information I can provide.

108
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,670
The name of the man is Jimmy Stevens.
He's staying in apartment

109
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:49,303
32 at 840 West 58th Street.
Do you have that?

110
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,009
-Yes.
-We'll schedule our conversations-

111
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:55,483
-by phone in the early evenings.
Will this work for you, Frank?

112
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,454
I am waiting for your answer, Frank.

113
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,587
Detective Turlotte?

114
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:11,896
Detective Turlotte, if there's a problem- if it's the money-

115
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:17,772
A green canary...somebody lost their canary

116
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,235
What?

117
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,242
I'll do it

118
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,941
Just write down the address and I'll tell the messenger.

119
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,153
Okay, we'll take care of it.

120
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,215
Mr. Stevens, there's ataxi outside.
You want me to hold him for you?

121
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,157
No thank you

122
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,956
Have a good day

123
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:45,129
Frank, what do you think?

124
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:49,494
The subject appears to lead a very monotonous, simple
existence

125
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:52,235
What do you mean? You think his life is boring?

126
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,403
-Did you get the photos?
=Yes

127
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,371
What do you think?

128
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:01,407
You're absolutely right.
I don't see anything very interesting

129
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:07,384
Personally, I find myself drawn
to some of the little details.

130
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:11,950
He lights a cigarette and then
puts it out almost immediately.

131
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:14,718
-Maybe he's trying to quit.
-Not a chance..

132
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,590
Look at the way he does it.
It's not haphazard.

133
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:23,056
He repeats it down to the smallest detail. It's like a ritual.

134
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:24,832
So what?

135
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:29,998
Well it's interesting,
a nervous habit like that

136
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:34,043
with a guy who otherwise acts so smooth.

137
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:38,649
Look at the way he tears his cigarettes
apart after he takes two puffs.

138
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:42,309
That's all you've got for me,
notes about how the guy smokes?

139
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:46,054
Notice the expression on his face
when he talks to the children

140
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:47,822
I don't follow you

141
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,194
Doesn't it seem strange to you
the way he looks at them

142
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:52,557
when he's talking to them?

143
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:54,528
No. So what?

144
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:59,534
Well, Mr. Doe, it just seems
curious to me that a guy

145
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:03,606
who dresses with such sophistication
should be spending so much time

146
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,504
talking to children in the park.

147
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,645
What do you mean by that?

148
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,839
I just thought it was worth mentioning. That's all

149
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:14,645
-That's all?
-That's all, Mr. Doe. That's all

150
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:20,284
And like all ruthless contract-killers, your Mr. Stevens

151
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,324
is close to his aged mother.

152
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:25,657
-How do you know it's his mother?
-It's an assisted-living facility

153
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:29,028
I called it. She has the same last name.

154
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,634
Do you want me to keep working foryou?

155
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:34,733
Yes, but I need a lot more.
Can you make contact with him?

156
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:38,137
You know, sayyou're someone else
and gain his confidence.

157
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,937
Do you think that's possible?

158
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:42,576
Well, I said I was only an eye

159
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:47,247
At these prices, I think I can ask
for you to expand your job description

160
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,047
a little don't you think, Frank?

161
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:54,822
Yes Sir, Mr. Doe.
I'll talk to you later

162
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,673
Excuse me. Hello?

163
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:50,314
This is my usual bench.
Do you mind if I sit here?

164
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:53,110
No.

165
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:10,935
That's -

166
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:14,435
-What are the chances?
-Odd, isn't it?

167
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,367
-Enjoying it?
-I'm fascinated by it

168
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,679
I think it'll be very helpful to me.

169
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:28,145
-In what way?
-Well, because I like to study birds...

170
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:47,562
Hello?

171
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:51,005
Frank, I hope you really have
something of value for me this time

172
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:56,545
He invited me to dinner.
And he called me "old friend."

173
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:59,442
-What did he talk about?
-A lot of things.

174
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,415
I made him think I was a birdwatcher,

175
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,180
so he starts talking about birdwatchers.

176
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:09,487
He says the best ones use their
ears as much as their eyes.

177
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:12,931
And you should do the same thing
when you try to practice-

178
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:17,027
the art of memory. He said he
remembered being here on 9/11

179
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:20,171
not bywhat got repeated
ad nauseam on the TV-

180
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,067
but bythe smell of the smoke.

181
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:23,934
You seem to have listened carefully

182
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:27,670
No, no, I'm forgetting a lot.
I told you, I'm an eye, not an ear

183
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:30,314
-Did he talk about his work?
-No

184
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,507
Then that's everything you've got for me?

185
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:35,016
Are you kidding?!
Didn't you hearwhat I said?

186
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:38,781
The guy invited me to dinner!
That's got to be the jackpot.

187
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:42,290
Okay, Frank, but don't take it
easy and get sloppy on me

188
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:43,761
Watch out

189
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:50,932
We have... very little time.
Good bye, Frank

190
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:08,402
Hi sweetheart. I'm at work.

191
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:10,975
Me too.

192
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:19,307
What kind of trouble? It's the propeller.
Yes. It's not serious,

193
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,452
just have Mark take a look at it.

194
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:28,050
It looks like another week.
Yeah, it's screwy, with the amount of money

195
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:31,354
this guy's paying me something's
not Kosher but I don't know

196
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:36,626
what it is yet. The client is going
to call me in five minutes.

197
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,970
The subject just came home.
I gottato run. I'll call you later.

198
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,173
-Yeah.
-Anything new for me?

199
00:31:55,513 --> 00:32:00,416
What would you say if I told you I'm looking at him right
now

200
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,745
through a window.

201
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:05,082
You're looking at who...?

202
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:07,651
At the Pope! Who do you think I'm looking at

203
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,794
=You mean to say you're-
-That's right

204
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:15,865
I've got my camera planted in a
window across from his living room

205
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:19,533
-As we speak?
-As we speak, Mr. Doe

206
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:25,601
Is there anything interesting going on, Frank?

207
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:29,903
The subject is on his couch
talking to someone on the telephone

208
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:32,983
You'd think he was looking right at me

209
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:38,982
I'm not paying you to find out
he's talking on the telephone,

210
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:43,282
that's hardly a newsflash! Can you
tell me who it is he's talking to?

211
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:44,720
Give me time. I'll find-

212
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:47,456
Basically, you don't have
anything new?! That's it?

213
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:51,335
You know Mr. Doe,
you are starting to bother me!

214
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,995
-I am?
=Yeah, that's right. Mr. Doe.

215
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:56,265
This is what you get for your dough, Mr. Doe,

216
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:59,772
that is, until it leads somewhere
and because you won't tell me more

217
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:02,777
I've no ideawhere it's leading...
so you'd better get used to it

218
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:05,415
or find yourself someone else,
are we clear?

219
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:15,416
What strikes me is watching this
guy is so dull it's interesting.

220
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:20,795
It's like I've taken acid and
I'm watching bacteria grow

221
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:22,762
on linoleum for days.

222
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:25,232
You're wrong, Frank.
You'd bettertry harder

223
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:28,772
I happen to know right now,
while you're looking at him,

224
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,268
He's arranging a murder

225
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:43,282
I met a traveler from an antique land who said:

226
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:46,116
Two vast and trunkless legs of stone...

227
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:11,411
Here it is

228
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:16,743
That's fine. Thank you.
And you can take that, too

229
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:18,222
Certainly

230
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,948
-It's good to see you.
=Yes

231
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:51,421
We're going to have a little fun
tonight, Frank.

232
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:54,318
You don't have anything against
having a little fun, do you?

233
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:57,552
-Not at all, in fact-
-I'm going to go have a cigarette

234
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:59,821
-Will you join me?
-I quit years ago

235
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,662
Good foryou. Keep me company, would you?

236
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:16,680
I'm sorry, sir, I 'm afraid I can't
let you smoke that out here in front

237
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:19,950
Of course....

238
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:38,925
Would you believe it? They have
customers who are worried about

239
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:42,334
being poisoned by my cigarettes outdoors!

240
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,442
Fear sells.

241
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:50,440
It's so damn depressing...

242
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:55,875
And the thing that's particularly
hard on me is that I get paid

243
00:35:56,053 --> 00:36:00,752
to be an optimist, but recently
I've been letting my melancholia

244
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:01,152
to show...

245
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:09,925
You know you've got a very
strange way of looking at me.

246
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:13,659
What do you mean you've been
allowing your melancholiato show?

247
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:18,398
Well first tell me what it is you
were thinking when you were observing

248
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:19,634
me like that.

249
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:24,042
Alright, I was just wondering
why someone would light a cigarette,

250
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:26,342
put it out and start all over.

251
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:32,247
-I don't know.
=You don't know? That's rich

252
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,893
Let's go back inside

253
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:52,567
-ls it all birds that interest you?
=Yes

254
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:56,571
But I tend to concentrate on a
particular kind of bird

255
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:59,147
for a period of time, and then on another.

256
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:01,108
What are you interested in now?

257
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:02,582
-Now?
=Yes

258
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,989
-Peregrine falcons.
-Why?

259
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:09,854
I don't know. Maybe because they're predators.

260
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,527
Predators are the fastest birds,
the most majestic.

261
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:16,531
Do you think that's true among humans,

262
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:19,232
that predators are the most majestic?

263
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:24,932
No, not from what I've seen.
Peregrine falcons are also survivors.

264
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:29,238
In New York City theywere
practically extinct bythe 1950s

265
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:34,009
because they digested so much DDT.
The shell of their eggs became

266
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:38,053
so fragile they'd break when the
mothertried to keep the eggs warm.

267
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,890
Now the Peregrine falcons are coming back.

268
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:42,926
Survivors..

269
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,957
Care to taste the wine now, sir?

270
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:54,234
You can leave it here.

271
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:06,016
I think we'll just let this breathe for a while.

272
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,913
So how does optimism pay?

273
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:12,918
My impression is that optimism pays quite well.

274
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:17,789
My job has consisted of predicting
future energy needs

275
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:22,262
for what are euphemistically known as
"developing countries."

276
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,331
And based on those predictions,
international financial institutions

277
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:30,270
then fund construction projects
to meet the anticipated demand.

278
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:34,210
The greaterthe anticipated
demand the largerthe amount

279
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:39,748
of construction. A wall is supposed
to exist between our research

280
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:44,377
and the companies that would
profit from distorting our estimates.

281
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:50,086
but in practice that wall does not exist.

282
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,664
Beautiful legs...

283
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:02,872
As a result, the countries are never
able to pay back the loans

284
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,999
and instead they become even more at
the mercy of international capital.

285
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:09,572
Try the wine.

286
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:17,921
-What do you think?
-About what?

287
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:21,058
-The wine.
-Oh, It's very good

288
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:25,825
They wanted me to make it all up...

289
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:31,424
but they didn't want to know
that I was making it up.

290
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:36,800
They didn't want to know what they knew.
And I didn't want to know

291
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:37,941
what I know.

292
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:40,771
What changed? Was it your memories

293
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:48,545
What hasn't changed is fear,
but I think I've found a solution

294
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:52,450
to that fear.
Even though it's a personal one.

295
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:54,624
And your bout of melancholia?

296
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:59,327
It disturbed their sleep.... perhaps that's all it did

297
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:00,960
Then why bother?

298
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:20,748
I have to make a phone call.
This may take a few minutes.

299
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:24,115
I won't be too long.
Just enjoyyourwine until I get back.

300
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:37,163
The gentleman left a note foryou, sir

301
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:51,809
Sorry, I don't have time to explain.
I have to leave immediately.

302
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:54,007
Meet me tomorrow evening at the bench.

303
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:30,376
-I'm sorry about last night.
-What was that about?

304
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:35,188
It was just instinct. I felt I was in danger

305
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,656
-In danger?
-I felt someone was following me

306
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:39,988
Come on!

307
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:44,362
Listen Frank, I get the feeling
someone is watching

308
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:45,661
my every move.

309
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,669
What are you talking about?
You're being watched?

310
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:52,070
There are one or more persons
who are paying careful attention

311
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:53,267
to everything I do..

312
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,002
You know what they want from you?

313
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,846
=Yes, I think so.
-Optimism?

314
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:07,718
It's too late for that. Listen,
about last night - that was my treat.

315
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:09,585
I'll see you soon.

316
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:15,455
-Wait. Tell me what's happening.
-I can't now.

317
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:17,634
I promise I will when I can

318
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:38,449
What do you have for me, Frank?

319
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:40,613
The subject thinks he's being watched.

320
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:43,055
-He is.
-Yes, I know

321
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:47,823
Not byyou, Frank, by others.
They'll make contact with him soon

322
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:53,698
That means time has ran out,
fasterthan I had hoped. So incredibly fast

323
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,672
I had hoped you would have been
able to spend more time with him

324
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,071
and tell me who this person really is.
But that's impossible now.

325
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:02,838
It's too risky. I'm sorry about this.

326
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:06,574
There is one last thing you can do
for me to fulfill your contract.

327
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,446
A meeting will take place this coming Thursday

328
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,917
at midnight in Red Hook.

329
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:14,122
The murderwill take place down near T Street.

330
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:15,781
-Do you know Red Hook?
-The Hook?

331
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,529
Yeah, I know the hook. Thursday?

332
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:20,497
I can find out more about this guy, Mr. Doe

333
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:24,225
No. Stand down, Frank. I'd like you to stay away now.

334
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:26,301
Did he tell you anything about his work?

335
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,364
- No.
-You're lying

336
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,408
Mr. Doe,
this guy is not a professional killer

337
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:35,204
He is, Frank, I tell you he's guilty!

338
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:37,972
Mr. Doe, the guy is guilty of a lot of things, I'm sure,

339
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:40,116
but being a killer isn't one of them.

340
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,776
-He's guilty!
-What are you guilty of, Mr. Doe?

341
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:45,685
You're the one hiding your identity.

342
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:47,483
Is it the same thing Jimmy's guilty of?

343
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:50,889
Anyway, it doesn't matter what you think anymore

344
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:53,894
Just be at the meeting. That's where
your presence can really make

345
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:57,363
a difference. Until then,
lay off, spend some of the money

346
00:43:57,534 --> 00:43:59,661
I've wired to you. Enjoy yourself.

347
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:03,173
A final payment with a bonus will
be wired into your account

348
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:05,607
after the meeting. Good-bye, Frank.

349
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:44,407
I won't be coming back again, Mom

350
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:54,039
They only serve Rattatouille here
with noodles. They overcook it here

351
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:58,914
-It's overcooked everywhere.
-Everything is coming apart...

352
00:45:59,723 --> 00:46:04,057
And you, you're like a cow's cud,
like used chewing tobacco

353
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:08,187
-Very used, yes.
-Molly used you

354
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,798
-Why do you call her Molly?
-She used you

355
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:14,426
She sends you a kiss. She'll
come to see you when I can't

356
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:18,271
You never came to see me.
It's not you who are there

357
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:21,274
-It's not me?
=You are not there.

358
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:22,901
Who's not there?

359
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:29,212
The big ugly duckling, he's not
there. All around are little ducklings,

360
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:32,782
-Tire you out, don't they?
=Yes

361
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:39,287
Little ducklings are so tiring.
She's here, the big dipper!

362
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:43,000
She's not going to get me, is she going to get you, ugly
duckling?

363
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:43,967
-no

364
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:48,764
Take your carotene!
Around here they know.

365
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:52,974
Take your carotene and your life won't waste away.

366
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:54,977
You will be infinite.

367
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:02,347
I hearyou're in a bind, son.

368
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:09,515
I hear it all, you're going to be
happy because you have your harpy.

369
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:16,065
They're going to finish you, aren't they?

370
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:25,475
Yes

371
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:33,706
Really? Then you will have a
beginning, middle and end.

372
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:38,618
Have some noodle soup.

373
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,026
You always were awet noodle,
weren't you?

374
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:49,164
And what is a noodle, Mom?

375
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:56,236
A noodle? It's the mind of a man
who is totally alone.

376
00:47:57,507 --> 00:48:05,414
Totally, and he doesn't
even know it. Alone.

377
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:16,118
What's that?

378
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:25,924
My little fingerjust told me the big
ugly duckling is no longer all alone,

379
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,261
is that true?

380
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:34,107
It's true, Mom. I am no longer all alone

381
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:37,564
My love, as they watch without understanding,

382
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:42,171
I struggle to reach the death at their hands that I have
planned for myself.

383
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:45,441
Before then I must see you.

384
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:50,602
I will contact you again through
our beloved Lila. Jimmy

385
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:13,560
Excuse me. Do you know this man?
I have something to give him

386
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:17,064
Yes, it's Jimmy. Jimmy lives with
Eileen on the fifth floor,

387
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,870
but he's away. She's his
"sophisticated lady." See you!

388
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:45,562
-Hello?
-Eileen Brahm?

389
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:47,794
Yes?
I'm a friend of Jimmy's

390
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:50,940
-Where is he?
-Where can we arrange to meet?

391
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:10,515
I've got trouble, trouble, trouble.

392
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:15,320
Holding this man of mine.

393
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:29,168
Say it seems there's trouble
every time I speak my mind...

394
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:35,681
Thank you.

395
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:47,020
You must be a new friend of Jimmy's.

396
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:50,793
-Why new?
-Because I know all his old friends

397
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:55,871
We've known each other a short time.
How did you know it was me?

398
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:58,403
Everybody else here is a regular

399
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:01,102
I don't know why he's worried about you

400
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:08,278
Really? I know why I worry about him. Do you worry about
him?

401
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:11,880
-Sure.
-Because you like him?

402
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:13,622
Something like that

403
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:17,860
Let's be straight with each other,
shall we?

404
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:20,789
You're wasting your time talking to
me if you're looking for Jimmy.

405
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:22,895
I don't know where he is.

406
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:24,191
That's okay

407
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:37,547
First time I met Jimmy was at the club

408
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:43,847
He was with some associates.
Jimmy was the one that looked lost.

409
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:48,157
That evening, Jimmy didn't miss a song.

410
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:51,589
He kept coming back to hear me sing.

411
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:53,996
You really are a masochist

412
00:53:54,497 --> 00:53:58,456
Maybe so, but that's not why I keep coming back.

413
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:03,036
There's a story about the painter
Delacroix who wrote to his friend

414
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:06,607
Chopin, the composer,
"Last night when you played,

415
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:13,439
I heard the blue note."
And when you sing I hear the blue note.

416
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:20,454
The blue note? That's nice

417
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:25,684
It's more than nice, it's sophisticated

418
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:30,288
That's how I became his
"sophisticated lady."

419
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:33,693
You know besides me there's a much youngerwoman

420
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:35,064
in your friend's life.

421
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,364
The little girl

422
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:38,973
Yes, her motherworks
housecleaning in the building.

423
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,938
Her daughter and I became friends and then when Lila met
Jimmy

424
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:45,411
it was like they were lost souls.

425
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,578
It's very sweet how important
they are to each other.

426
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:54,048
Here it is.

427
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,730
Will you come see me again sometime, Frank?

428
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:07,199
Sure

429
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:13,941
Did Jimmy ever mention his work to you?

430
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:20,480
No, never. Good night, Frank

431
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:44,132
I brought you a sandwich
with extra mustard

432
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,870
And how did you know that's what I wanted?

433
00:55:47,243 --> 00:55:52,977
You're easy to read. I gave her your
letter. I read it before I did

434
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:55,914
-You read it?
-You didn't seal it

435
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:58,577
-That's your excuse?
-I didn't have to tell you

436
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:01,087
Did you talk to your Mother
about what was in the letter?

437
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:03,916
Are you kidding? It would
be really bad if she knew

438
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:05,450
What exactly?

439
00:56:05,628 --> 00:56:09,223
That some guys were looking for you.
She'd say that's what happens

440
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:10,525
to people like you.

441
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:11,893
Like me?

442
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:13,535
She thinks you're nice.

443
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,866
It's because of you that l
can afford to go to my school,

444
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,338
but she says there's something wrong with you.

445
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:22,840
If she found out guys were
looking foryou she'd say,

446
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:24,673
"That guy has it coming to him."

447
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:27,776
What do these guys want to do to you?

448
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:29,919
Do theywant to teach you a lesson?

449
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:33,122
Yes

450
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,751
Would you mind looking after her for a moment?

451
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:40,327
Sometimes she really gets to me.

452
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:58,173
How's business?

453
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:01,608
I retire in six months. You think
you can you find a place for me?

454
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:03,912
Call me when you get your gold watch

455
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:06,622
You've changed, Frank.

456
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:12,884
I did that little favoryou asked me
to do. Where did you find this guy?

457
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:18,056
His information is classified above
my rank. That tells me something.

458
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:22,394
It tells me you should drop it. You're
just a little private dick.

459
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:25,340
You might get it chopped off like
one of these guys here.

460
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:39,615
-Did the guys show up?
-No. She's been missing you

461
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:43,322
It's because of her! These guys
don't like to have someone see them.

462
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:44,824
What if they wanted to punch you?

463
00:57:44,994 --> 00:57:46,484
Well, what about it?

464
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:50,121
It's not the same if nobody knows
or if there is some person who sees it

465
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,458
That's true

466
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:54,665
I got this book for my birthday

467
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:44,186
Why are fairy tales always for children?

468
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,682
Fairy tales don't interest you grown-ups?

469
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:49,654
Perhaps fairies don't want to live with us

470
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:55,358
But they do live with us.
See that old woman? She's a fairy!

471
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,524
You know, I was wondering about her

472
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:06,868
You want to tell me a story?
You promised me a story about Lulu.

473
00:59:07,143 --> 00:59:08,371
Is Lulu real?

474
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:09,979
Yes

475
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:12,911
You said you found him again
because you saw his name

476
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:17,151
=Yes. I did in a newspaper article.
-With his picture

477
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,287
Yes.

478
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:21,917
Well, why doesn't he recognize you?

479
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:22,750
Well

480
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:25,924
We were about your age. Look at me now.

481
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:28,787
You know when you see somebody
you haven't seen for a long time

482
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:30,762
you don't always recognize them.

483
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,533
It was his family name that
I recognized - Turlotte.

484
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:36,934
Why doesn't he recognize your name?

485
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:41,506
Because my mother changed
our name. He kept his.

486
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:44,313
It's all he has left of his family.

487
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:46,908
What happened to them?

488
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:51,116
Well, that's a story I don't want to tell you

489
00:59:51,854 --> 00:59:53,947
Tell me the story you want to tell me

490
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:59,956
It's a sad story and it's a happy story, too

491
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:01,956
Tell it to me

492
01:00:02,565 --> 01:00:06,831
It was a long time ago,
at a time when men had gone crazy

493
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:08,197
What were they doing?

494
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:12,239
With their planes,
they were shooting at people

495
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:45,018
Did you go there?

496
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:47,645
Yes, we walked

497
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:12,748
You and Lulu,
did you make it to Salsparello?

498
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:14,416
Yes

499
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:19,480
-So, it was thanks to Lulu?
=Yes

500
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:23,585
Did Lulu do anything else?

501
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:27,822
-Yes.
-Tell me

502
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,165
Not today, I'll tell you tomorrow

503
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:35,167
Okay, see you tomorrow, Mr. Jimmy.

504
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:37,168
Mr. Salsparello!

505
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:48,173
Lila, would you tell Eileen to
meet me tonight at the Oasis

506
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:51,650
at closing time, okay? Thank you.

507
01:05:30,893 --> 01:05:32,190
You look happy sitting there.

508
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:34,386
It's because you're here

509
01:05:35,798 --> 01:05:38,096
Why did we stop enjoying the city one day?

510
01:05:38,968 --> 01:05:41,459
-Why?
=Yes, why?

511
01:05:41,637 --> 01:05:43,264
Because they are stronger than us?

512
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:46,471
Not stronger. Almost stronger

513
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:48,869
Almost?

514
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:51,847
Why don't we get away to Diego's place?

515
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:57,576
They would find me. Even there they
would find me. It's finished, Eileen.

516
01:05:57,753 --> 01:05:58,720
I don't want to run.

517
01:05:58,921 --> 01:06:00,548
So you're going to wait for them?

518
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:05,694
-Have you thought about me?
-I never stop thinking about you.

519
01:06:06,095 --> 01:06:08,620
You know that. I've arranged everything

520
01:06:11,867 --> 01:06:13,926
Aren't you afraid of what they'll do to you?

521
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:18,199
I was afraid for a very long time.
I think the thing that frightened me

522
01:06:18,374 --> 01:06:22,868
the most was that I would be
reduced somehow, to a thing.

523
01:06:24,213 --> 01:06:25,771
But I'm not afraid anymore.

524
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:32,988
You said theywere almost stronger. Why "almost"?

525
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:36,124
Do you remember what I told you when we were at Diego's?

526
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:37,793
Every word.

527
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:43,291
You said that your love for me made
you feel that there was something

528
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:45,593
strongerthan everything else.

529
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,715
You promised me the rest of the story about Lulu

530
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:18,152
Lulu.

531
01:11:03,626 --> 01:11:03,759
Without your friend that man
would have died in no special way

532
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:07,251
Without your friend that man
would have died in no special way

533
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:12,632
That's right. In no special way

534
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:15,870
You're very lucky to have a friend like that

535
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:19,433
Yes, I am.

536
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:30,978
You know I'm not going to be here tomorrow.

537
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:32,713
Where will you be?

538
01:11:34,356 --> 01:11:36,984
I'm going to be with the men who are looking for me

539
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:40,626
Who are they? Are they friends of yours?

540
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:42,923
They're the people I have to leave with

541
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:45,431
Is Eileen going to be with you?

542
01:11:45,601 --> 01:11:48,570
Yes, in the same way that you're going to be with me.

543
01:11:50,839 --> 01:11:56,243
You know, Lila, I am very happy to have met you

544
01:11:56,412 --> 01:11:58,505
and very proud to have gotten to know you

545
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:31,902
Good afternoon..

546
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:35,382
What do you want? Are you the new doctor?

547
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:39,313
-I am a friend of your son.
-Who has a son? I have a son?

548
01:12:39,555 --> 01:12:40,522
Jimmy

549
01:12:40,889 --> 01:12:43,824
-I'm going to stuff that empty shell.
-Really?

550
01:12:43,992 --> 01:12:47,723
That shell, that empty shell,
just look at his Michelle, his Shelly!

551
01:12:47,896 --> 01:12:48,885
Eileen?

552
01:12:49,398 --> 01:12:53,095
Of course you lean, you're not standing upright,

553
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:56,237
you are leaning on a cane that's
like a dog cut from paper.

554
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,734
She never gave him vitamins,
everybody knows that.

555
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:03,537
You're worried about him?

556
01:13:04,346 --> 01:13:08,942
If you were a mother you'd know.
I make you his mother. I assign you

557
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:14,947
I sign all the papers. Like that.
Like that. All the papers signed. Like that.

558
01:13:15,124 --> 01:13:16,421
No... not me

559
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:21,085
I'm not worried about anything.
I don't have a worry in the world,

560
01:13:23,465 --> 01:13:26,491
but that guy - he's finished.

561
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:28,099
Finished?

562
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:32,701
Beginning, middle and father. His goose is cooked

563
01:13:32,975 --> 01:13:33,942
Really?

564
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:40,043
Don't pretend to be an idiot.
I can't stand your "really"? Really?

565
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:43,184
-No, I just meant-
-You mean nothing, zero!

566
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:49,388
It's me who speaks and I say he
is no longer all alone. Ugly duckling

567
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:51,521
Yes, he is no longer alone

568
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:54,594
Ugly cooked goose, but not alone

569
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:56,196
He has Eileen

570
01:13:56,565 --> 01:14:01,593
Not some her, some "one." You get it?

571
01:14:05,908 --> 01:14:09,867
No you don't get it! Leave! Out! Out!

572
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:14,440
You won't get him. Now that he
has someone on his side!

573
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:16,584
You won't get him!

574
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:48,907
Are you looking for something?

575
01:15:50,913 --> 01:15:53,006
This was in the newspaper a couple of months ago

576
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:56,849
I know. I saw it the day it appeared

577
01:15:57,953 --> 01:16:00,319
So you've been following me since you saw it?

578
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:01,581
That's right

579
01:16:04,459 --> 01:16:05,653
And you're John Doe.

580
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:14,663
You've been playing with me this
whole time. What's the game?

581
01:16:15,003 --> 01:16:17,130
What do you want from me?
What is it you want?

582
01:16:19,808 --> 01:16:24,211
Why are you doing this?
Is it the money you wired me?

583
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:28,577
It's dirty, isn't it? You're setting
me up to be the patsy, the fall guy, right?

584
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,684
-No, that's not it.
-Why then?

585
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:32,615
Why did you get me involved with this?

586
01:16:32,788 --> 01:16:36,485
The meeting will take place tonight
in Red Hook down by the water

587
01:16:36,658 --> 01:16:39,786
Not a chance. You're on your own.

588
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:32,923
Hey soldier boy

589
01:19:33,301 --> 01:19:34,598
Just drive

590
01:20:05,534 --> 01:20:06,967
Isn't it late for you to be up?

591
01:20:07,435 --> 01:20:10,563
My Mom is working at a cocktail
party on the third floor.

592
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:13,572
You have your doll

593
01:20:13,742 --> 01:20:15,073
He doesn't need her anymore.

594
01:20:15,243 --> 01:20:18,474
He has his friend, Lulu, who's
going to be there tonight.

595
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:19,944
Lulu?

596
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:23,506
Some people are bothering
him but with Lulu he's okay

597
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:27,978
Who is Lulu?

598
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:31,957
Lulu is afraid of nothing.
He once watched another man die!

599
01:20:32,127 --> 01:20:33,287
Can you believe it?

600
01:20:36,231 --> 01:20:37,664
What did you say?

601
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:39,296
Are you deaf?

602
01:20:40,702 --> 01:20:41,828
Completely.

603
01:20:53,748 --> 01:20:54,874
What are you doing, Frank?

604
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:57,648
Tell Joe I had to borrow his boat

605
01:20:58,553 --> 01:21:00,180
Joe ain't going to like this

606
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:42,321
Go get him, champ

607
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:13,751
It's time my friend.

608
01:23:19,561 --> 01:23:21,188
Let's take a walk overthere.

609
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:06,698
I knew you'd be here.
It changes everything

610
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:08,172
Stay still

611
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:13,840
This is 911. What is your emergency?

612
01:24:14,015 --> 01:24:16,882
A man's been shot here in Red Hook

613
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:20,684
A man's been shot! Did you get that?!

614
01:24:21,756 --> 01:24:25,214
South of T Street. Send an ambulance!

615
01:24:27,128 --> 01:24:28,322
Will you stop!?

616
01:24:30,632 --> 01:24:32,759
Where are you trying to go?!

617
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:52,986
Salsparello

618
01:26:53,474 --> 01:26:56,238
Right there, there, here

619
01:26:56,911 --> 01:26:58,071
Look through there

620
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:01,075
It's a whole family

621
01:27:04,285 --> 01:27:05,513
Can you see them?

622
01:27:10,325 --> 01:27:11,849
It's Beautiful.
