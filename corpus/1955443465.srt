1
00:01:38,992 --> 00:01:40,742
Mama.

2
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:00,051
How does this story begin?

3
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:07,558
It begins like so many stories

4
00:02:08,603 --> 00:02:10,520
With a boy...

5
00:02:11,306 --> 00:02:14,732
too old to be a kid...

6
00:02:15,773 --> 00:02:19,777
too young to be a man.

7
00:02:24,015 --> 00:02:27,412
And a nightmare.

8
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,454
It has two fundamental constants:

9
00:05:26,487 --> 00:05:30,201
E, the base of the natural logarithm system.

10
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,769
It is a number.
It is a number that emerges from our scheme.

11
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,626
What is the mathematical function
or thing which describes things...

12
00:05:39,794 --> 00:05:45,820
By the rate which they change is
proportional to their magnitude?

13
00:05:46,332 --> 00:05:52,305
If you do that mathematically,
it will give you this fundamental constant.

14
00:05:54,431 --> 00:05:56,934
Conor?

15
00:05:57,975 --> 00:06:00,521
You all right there, Conor?

16
00:06:00,685 --> 00:06:02,355
You look tired.

17
00:06:02,523 --> 00:06:04,392
Are you getting enough rest?

18
00:06:05,726 --> 00:06:06,988
Yeah, I'm fine.

19
00:06:07,496 --> 00:06:10,388
Because you know if
you ever want to talk...

20
00:06:10,588 --> 00:06:12,280
I'm fine.

21
00:06:12,448 --> 00:06:14,281
Okay.

22
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:19,162
Everyone, eyes front.

23
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:23,621
Pi is the ratio of the conference,
and when it all...

24
00:06:23,777 --> 00:06:25,925
Careful, O'Malley.
You might fall.

25
00:06:26,082 --> 00:06:28,292
Are you drunk or something?

26
00:06:28,441 --> 00:06:31,597
Get his ass slapped
so his mummy can kiss it for him.

27
00:06:34,383 --> 00:06:38,055
You're always off in your
own little dream world.

28
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:41,766
And what's there? So interesting?

29
00:06:44,016 --> 00:06:46,979
Get up.

30
00:06:49,121 --> 00:06:53,777
You've been a good boy. Remember, O'Malley.

31
00:06:53,945 --> 00:06:56,948
Good boys don't talk.

32
00:07:22,437 --> 00:07:25,230
- Hey, Con.
- Hey, mum.

33
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:32,028
- What is that?
- It's a surprise.

34
00:07:32,393 --> 00:07:36,658
- So this is a VCR?
- This is much better than a VCR.

35
00:07:36,693 --> 00:07:39,546
It's your grandpa's old film projector.

36
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,874
- There we go.
- I wish you could have known him.

37
00:07:42,954 --> 00:07:44,187
Who?

38
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:46,574
Grandpa.

39
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,975
Even grandma was softened up around him.

40
00:07:50,077 --> 00:07:51,998
Yeah, all right.

41
00:07:53,155 --> 00:07:54,617
Here we go.

42
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,848
What a bunch of assholes.

43
00:08:12,016 --> 00:08:14,375
Why are they trying to kill King Kong?

44
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:19,355
People don't like what
they do not understand.

45
00:08:21,055 --> 00:08:23,166
They get scared.

46
00:08:24,768 --> 00:08:27,602
King Kong could've just smashed them all...

47
00:08:28,071 --> 00:08:31,321
break them into a million pieces.

48
00:10:24,176 --> 00:10:27,178
Conor.

49
00:10:33,184 --> 00:10:35,602
Mum?

50
00:13:59,942 --> 00:14:04,393
I have come to get you, Conor O'Malley.

51
00:14:12,108 --> 00:14:14,925
Why don't you run, Conor O'Malley?

52
00:14:14,993 --> 00:14:17,327
Why don't you run for your mother?

53
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,641
You leave her alone. I'm not afraid of you.

54
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:42,842
I will visit you again on further nights,
Conor O'Malley...

55
00:14:43,011 --> 00:14:45,937
and I will shake your walls until you wake.

56
00:14:46,012 --> 00:14:49,666
And then I will tell you three stories.

57
00:14:50,966 --> 00:14:53,235
You're going to tell me stories?

58
00:14:54,004 --> 00:14:58,031
I am. I will tell you three stories.

59
00:14:58,108 --> 00:15:03,185
And when I've finished my stories,
you will tell me a fourth.

60
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:04,998
I don't know anything about stories.

61
00:15:05,084 --> 00:15:07,861
You will tell me a fourth
and it will be the truth.

62
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,190
- What are you talking about?
- This truth that you hide.

63
00:15:11,297 --> 00:15:13,631
The truth you dream.

64
00:15:13,671 --> 00:15:15,852
- You will tell me your nightmare.
- No.

65
00:15:16,003 --> 00:15:18,735
Yes. That will be your truth.

66
00:15:18,903 --> 00:15:21,069
And if I don't?

67
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:52,433
Oh, Con, I was asleep.

68
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:01,021
You should be in your own bed, Con.

69
00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:03,651
Five minutes.

70
00:16:03,815 --> 00:16:07,110
- That is not true.
- Yes it is.

71
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:13,032
- Come on, Con.
- Just five minutes. I promise.

72
00:16:16,203 --> 00:16:18,957
Five minutes.

73
00:16:24,334 --> 00:16:26,920
Night night.

74
00:17:42,989 --> 00:17:45,491
I respect that, Lizzie, I do.

75
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,947
But the last thing your father would want
would be for him to go to America...

76
00:17:49,007 --> 00:17:52,196
to live with some strange
woman and her strange child.

77
00:17:52,396 --> 00:17:54,584
We have to discuss this now.

78
00:17:54,752 --> 00:17:57,836
- Hey, Con.
- Ah, there's the little man.

79
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:01,674
- Where did you say you got these?
- From a very nice old people's home.

80
00:18:01,838 --> 00:18:05,133
They're clearing it out to make
flats and I will be the agent.

81
00:18:05,301 --> 00:18:07,012
Your mother needs a cup of tea.

82
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,751
Green, no sugar. I take mine black.

83
00:18:09,897 --> 00:18:11,331
What do you think, Con?

84
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,296
He loves it.

85
00:18:13,341 --> 00:18:14,728
- Go on.
- Okay.

86
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:18,464
Go on. Try something else.

87
00:18:20,216 --> 00:18:23,723
- I'm only doing this for you.
- I do not have this conversation now.

88
00:18:23,891 --> 00:18:26,352
I understand that,
but you can not go on like this, Lizzie.

89
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,857
- You have to take some decisions.
- I'm not doing that.

90
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:43,221
Go help Conor with the tea,
or I'm literally going insane.

91
00:18:48,062 --> 00:18:51,529
- You and I need to have a talk.
- I'm making tea.

92
00:18:51,693 --> 00:18:55,954
- I said I'm making tea.
- We need to...

93
00:18:56,118 --> 00:18:58,667
I'm not the enemy, Conor.
I'm here to help your mother.

94
00:18:58,831 --> 00:19:00,963
- I know why you're here.
- I'm here because...

95
00:19:01,128 --> 00:19:05,096
12 year old boys shouldn't be wiping down
counters without being asked to first.

96
00:19:05,264 --> 00:19:08,851
- You want to do it?
- Less of your cheek.

97
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:11,362
She is always sick
after her treatments.

98
00:19:11,562 --> 00:19:13,905
She'll be better tomorrow,
and then you can go home.

99
00:19:14,073 --> 00:19:18,498
She'll seem better tomorrow.
She needs to talk about this with you.

100
00:19:18,662 --> 00:19:19,916
Talk to me about what?

101
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:25,758
- About you're coming to live with me.
- I will never come to live with you...

102
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:29,267
- Listen to me, Conor, if your mother...
- There is no if.

103
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:33,527
She'll be better and then you can go.

104
00:19:34,613 --> 00:19:37,198
Oh, Lizzie? Lizzie!

105
00:19:37,366 --> 00:19:39,831
My God. Hold on, hold on.

106
00:19:39,996 --> 00:19:43,418
Where's the medicine?
Conor!

107
00:19:43,587 --> 00:19:44,841
Conor!

108
00:19:45,005 --> 00:19:47,847
I'm here, I'm here.
Take a deep breath.

109
00:19:47,893 --> 00:19:52,017
Conor please.
Please, give me the medicine. Hurry.

110
00:19:54,321 --> 00:19:55,506
It's coming.

111
00:19:57,788 --> 00:20:00,208
Here you go, here you go.

112
00:20:03,674 --> 00:20:04,759
That's better.

113
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:06,596
Deep breath.

114
00:20:08,138 --> 00:20:09,894
Deep breath.

115
00:20:11,396 --> 00:20:14,734
Deep breath.
Deep breath.

116
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:19,119
It is okay.

117
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,937
Just don't touch anything.

118
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:42,322
Trust me,
I'll be doing my very best not to.

119
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:47,840
Our conversation isn't over, young man.

120
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,272
Oh yes it is.

121
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:22,111
Mum.

122
00:22:30,945 --> 00:22:33,233
What took you so long?

123
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:36,297
It is time for me to
tell you the first tale.

124
00:22:36,334 --> 00:22:39,961
I don't need a tale.
I need a bus ticket for my grandma.

125
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,214
It is time for me to tell you...

126
00:22:42,382 --> 00:22:45,219
Where do you think you are going?
I will be listened to.

127
00:22:45,387 --> 00:22:47,207
I am as old as this land,
and I will...

128
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,227
What do you know
about anything?

129
00:22:49,395 --> 00:22:52,581
I know everything about you, Conor O'Malley.

130
00:22:52,586 --> 00:22:55,153
No you don't. If you did...

131
00:22:55,267 --> 00:22:58,818
You know I don't have time to listen
to stupid stories from a stupid tree...

132
00:22:58,819 --> 00:23:00,291
that is just a dream.

133
00:23:00,455 --> 00:23:04,299
A dream? What is a dream, Conor O'Malley?

134
00:23:04,463 --> 00:23:08,345
And who is to say that it is not
everything else that is a dream?

135
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:10,934
Never mind.

136
00:23:12,353 --> 00:23:14,779
I came to see you today,
because I thought...

137
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:19,324
You thought I might have come to
topple your enemies, slay your dragons.

138
00:23:19,325 --> 00:23:21,293
Or at least help me
with my grandmother.

139
00:23:21,493 --> 00:23:23,460
All you want to do
is tell me stories.

140
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,257
Stories about how I toppled my enemies.

141
00:23:27,425 --> 00:23:29,716
Stories of how I slew dragons.

142
00:23:29,885 --> 00:23:33,143
Let me tell you a tale
of when I came walking.

143
00:23:33,307 --> 00:23:35,980
Let me tell you of the
end of a wicked queen...

144
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:41,406
and how I made sure she
was never seen again.

145
00:23:46,123 --> 00:23:47,377
Go on then.

146
00:23:48,241 --> 00:23:49,784
Good.

147
00:24:21,147 --> 00:24:22,734
What do you see?

148
00:24:22,898 --> 00:24:25,155
Nothing. There are leafs in the way.

149
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:28,826
Use your imagination, Conor O'Malley.

150
00:24:28,994 --> 00:24:30,497
Now, what do you see?

151
00:24:34,588 --> 00:24:37,425
- I see a spark.
- Yes. And?

152
00:24:37,593 --> 00:24:41,100
No, it's water. It is watercolor.

153
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:43,007
Keep looking.

154
00:24:45,524 --> 00:24:47,612
- Wow.
- Wow, indeed.

155
00:24:47,781 --> 00:24:52,661
Long ago, before this was a town
with roads and trains and cars...

156
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,971
- this was a kingdom.
- Here?

157
00:24:55,071 --> 00:24:56,686
We don't even have a Tesco.

158
00:24:57,923 --> 00:25:00,427
It was a prosperous kingdom
with a wise king...

159
00:25:00,596 --> 00:25:02,680
With one peace for his people...

160
00:25:02,848 --> 00:25:06,106
but peace had come at a price.

161
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:09,777
The king had lost all three
of his sons in battle...

162
00:25:09,946 --> 00:25:11,876
to giants...

163
00:25:13,796 --> 00:25:15,481
to dragons...

164
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:19,879
to armies of men led by great wizards.

165
00:25:20,047 --> 00:25:21,952
This all sounds pretty fairytalish.

166
00:25:22,116 --> 00:25:26,191
You wouldn't say that if you heard the
screams of a man through by a spear.

167
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:36,160
The queen wasn't able to bear the
loss of all their three sons...

168
00:25:38,165 --> 00:25:39,994
Leaving the king alone in despair,

169
00:25:40,194 --> 00:25:43,423
with the company of his
only remaining heir...

170
00:25:43,591 --> 00:25:46,179
his orphaned grandson.

171
00:25:52,231 --> 00:25:54,065
The child was raised as a prince...

172
00:25:54,234 --> 00:25:57,989
winning the love of the kingdom
with his scaventry and good heart.

173
00:26:04,501 --> 00:26:07,968
His people loved him.

174
00:26:08,136 --> 00:26:09,802
Our future king.

175
00:26:13,646 --> 00:26:18,656
He was nearly a man when his
grandfather took a new wife.

176
00:26:22,662 --> 00:26:25,668
The king felt ill and
rumor began to spread...

177
00:26:25,832 --> 00:26:27,756
that she was an evil witch...

178
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:33,345
That she was bent on taking the throne
by herself by poisoning the king.

179
00:26:36,852 --> 00:26:40,696
A few weeks later the king died.

180
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:49,796
The prince was too young to
take the king's place...

181
00:26:49,961 --> 00:26:55,887
So, by law,
the queen would rule for another year.

182
00:26:59,895 --> 00:27:02,567
The future was uncertain.

183
00:27:14,421 --> 00:27:18,849
The prince meanwhile had
given away his heart.

184
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:23,358
She was beautiful and smart,
and though only a farmer's daughter...

185
00:27:23,523 --> 00:27:26,736
the kingdom smiled on the match.

186
00:27:30,326 --> 00:27:34,587
The queen however,
was rather enjoying being queen.

187
00:27:34,751 --> 00:27:38,927
And what better way to remain so,
than to marry the prince herself?

188
00:27:39,095 --> 00:27:41,098
What? That's disgusting.

189
00:27:41,263 --> 00:27:43,768
- She was his grandmother.
- Stepgrandmother...

190
00:27:43,936 --> 00:27:47,526
and still a young,
beautiful woman herself, don't forget.

191
00:27:47,691 --> 00:27:50,532
The prince, however, didn't like the idea.

192
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:59,548
He took the famer's daughter,
and they rode away into the night.

193
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:05,724
They stopped to rest under
the branches of a yew tree.

194
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,396
That's you.

195
00:28:08,565 --> 00:28:11,735
The next morning the Prince awoke.

196
00:28:11,903 --> 00:28:15,077
"Arise, my beloved" he said.

197
00:28:15,241 --> 00:28:19,000
But the farmer's daughter did not steer...

198
00:28:20,602 --> 00:28:23,417
Which was when the prince noticed the blood.

199
00:28:23,457 --> 00:28:24,636
Blood?

200
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:27,015
Someone had killed his
beloved in the night.

201
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:28,188
What?

202
00:28:29,352 --> 00:28:31,523
"The Queen" he cried.

203
00:28:31,692 --> 00:28:35,198
"The queen has murdered my bride."

204
00:28:35,362 --> 00:28:39,871
The villagers, full of fury and vengeance,
rose up at the crime.

205
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:43,129
It was then that I came walking.

206
00:29:06,642 --> 00:29:09,927
The queen was never seen again.

207
00:29:13,516 --> 00:29:15,350
Good. She deserved it.

208
00:29:16,274 --> 00:29:19,501
Now, I don't suppose you
can help me with my grandma.

209
00:29:19,846 --> 00:29:22,117
The story is not yet finished.

210
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:25,694
I took the queen and
carried her far enough away

211
00:29:25,894 --> 00:29:28,778
so that the townspeople
would never find her...

212
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:32,686
to a village by the sea,
where she began a new life.

213
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:35,092
But she killed the farmer's daughter.

214
00:29:35,517 --> 00:29:37,756
How can you save a murderer?

215
00:29:38,647 --> 00:29:39,898
You really are a monster.

216
00:29:39,967 --> 00:29:42,521
I never said she killed famer's daughter.

217
00:29:42,771 --> 00:29:46,389
I only said that the prince said it was so.

218
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:49,835
The prince never fell asleep that night...

219
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:54,336
but waited for the farmer's daughter
to be lost in her dreams...

220
00:29:54,853 --> 00:29:57,808
and then began his real plan.

221
00:29:58,807 --> 00:30:00,272
What?

222
00:30:01,437 --> 00:30:06,698
He knew her death would start a fire
that would consume the queen entire.

223
00:30:11,455 --> 00:30:13,883
That's a terrible story. And a cheat.

224
00:30:14,036 --> 00:30:15,639
It's a true story.

225
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,355
Many things that are true feel like a cheat.

226
00:30:18,676 --> 00:30:20,999
Kingdoms get their princes they deserve.

227
00:30:21,209 --> 00:30:23,522
Farmers' daughters die for no reason.

228
00:30:23,764 --> 00:30:26,659
And sometimes witches merit saving.

229
00:30:27,444 --> 00:30:30,273
Quite often, actually. You'd be surprised.

230
00:30:32,661 --> 00:30:37,591
So the good prince was a murderer and
the evil queen was no witch after all?

231
00:30:37,672 --> 00:30:41,431
No, the queen was most certainly a witch...

232
00:30:41,595 --> 00:30:44,908
and could well have been
on her way to great evil.

233
00:30:45,017 --> 00:30:46,578
Who can say?

234
00:30:46,652 --> 00:30:48,210
Then why did you save her then?

235
00:30:48,272 --> 00:30:52,200
Because what she was not, was a murderer.

236
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,238
She hadn't poisoned the king.

237
00:30:56,623 --> 00:30:59,553
He had merely grown old.

238
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:02,562
Did the prince ever get caught?

239
00:31:02,734 --> 00:31:05,688
No. He became a much beloved king...

240
00:31:06,381 --> 00:31:10,233
who ruled happily until
the end of his long days.

241
00:31:10,323 --> 00:31:11,780
Oh yes.

242
00:31:12,425 --> 00:31:13,710
I don't get it.

243
00:31:14,361 --> 00:31:15,571
Who is the good guy here?

244
00:31:15,651 --> 00:31:18,584
There is not always a good guy,
Conor O'Malley...

245
00:31:18,622 --> 00:31:20,711
nor is there always a bad one.

246
00:31:20,736 --> 00:31:23,251
Most people are somewhere in between.

247
00:31:25,066 --> 00:31:27,872
So how is this all meant
to save me from grandma?

248
00:31:29,499 --> 00:31:32,759
It is not her you need saving from.

249
00:31:52,695 --> 00:31:54,531
There are always two sides to a story.

250
00:31:54,699 --> 00:31:56,370
Now, how many of you know the saying:

251
00:31:56,535 --> 00:32:02,044
"Stick and stones may break my bones,
but words can never touch me?"

252
00:32:03,412 --> 00:32:05,877
That way the next time someone says
something to you just remember...

253
00:32:31,503 --> 00:32:33,270
Good, you're home.

254
00:32:34,301 --> 00:32:36,598
Your mum's upstairs.
She wants to talk to you.

255
00:32:36,635 --> 00:32:39,995
- What?
- Your father's flying in on Sunday.

256
00:32:40,522 --> 00:32:42,612
Dad's coming? From America?

257
00:32:43,318 --> 00:32:44,989
Go on.

258
00:32:45,157 --> 00:32:46,868
She's waiting.

259
00:32:47,034 --> 00:32:48,099
And pack your bag.

260
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,962
You're coming to stay
with me for a few days.

261
00:32:52,295 --> 00:32:54,382
Go on.

262
00:33:07,538 --> 00:33:09,534
That tree is amazing.

263
00:33:10,953 --> 00:33:13,078
It's been here for thousands of years.

264
00:33:16,086 --> 00:33:17,251
What do you think?

265
00:33:18,441 --> 00:33:21,112
I think Grandma is trying
to turn me into Tina Turner.

266
00:33:22,735 --> 00:33:24,038
She must be a fan.

267
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,989
Why am I going to stay with grandma?

268
00:33:35,194 --> 00:33:36,761
Are you goig back to the hospital?

269
00:33:38,171 --> 00:33:41,132
Come here, Con.

270
00:33:45,476 --> 00:33:48,897
This lastest treatment is not
doing what it's supposed to.

271
00:33:50,569 --> 00:33:52,325
So they're going to adjust it...

272
00:33:53,206 --> 00:33:54,542
try something else.

273
00:33:57,206 --> 00:33:59,097
- That's all?
- That's all.

274
00:34:00,296 --> 00:34:01,819
Are you sure?

275
00:34:04,936 --> 00:34:06,475
I'm sure.

276
00:34:08,075 --> 00:34:09,646
Because...

277
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:12,026
you can tell me, you know.

278
00:34:34,129 --> 00:34:35,986
Everything will be fine, Conor.

279
00:34:37,865 --> 00:34:39,259
You'll see.

280
00:35:26,107 --> 00:35:27,988
Wait up, Conor. Where are you going?

281
00:35:29,751 --> 00:35:31,787
- Don't touch him.
- "Don't touch him?"

282
00:35:31,873 --> 00:35:35,013
- With a punch to the face?
- I said don't touch him.

283
00:35:37,053 --> 00:35:39,165
O'Malley and I have an understanding.

284
00:35:40,345 --> 00:35:42,233
I'm the only one who touches him.

285
00:35:43,401 --> 00:35:44,676
Isn't that right?

286
00:35:45,653 --> 00:35:46,778
Now tell me.

287
00:35:48,325 --> 00:35:52,849
Why is it that every time I turn around,
you're there looking at me?

288
00:35:53,332 --> 00:35:56,977
Getting a bit odd, don't you think?

289
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:01,731
Sorry, that was a bit harsh.

290
00:36:01,852 --> 00:36:03,828
Life isn't really going your way today,
are they.

291
00:36:04,687 --> 00:36:06,860
You picked the wrong spot.

292
00:36:23,683 --> 00:36:25,341
I have a house to show.

293
00:36:25,745 --> 00:36:28,863
I trust you alone here
till your father shows up.

294
00:36:29,063 --> 00:36:30,882
I'm not five years old.

295
00:36:32,878 --> 00:36:34,493
This is the correct time.

296
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:37,866
Not the one on your
phone or on the computer,

297
00:36:38,066 --> 00:36:39,655
not even on the news.

298
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:43,110
That was my mother's,
your great grandmother's.

299
00:36:43,196 --> 00:36:46,036
Perfect timekeeping for
over a hundred years.

300
00:36:46,803 --> 00:36:49,037
Conor! Pack up your rucksack.

301
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:54,572
I don't want your father to think
that I'm keeping you in a pigsty.

302
00:36:55,074 --> 00:36:56,546
- Not much of that.
- No.

303
00:36:57,633 --> 00:37:00,151
When you go to the hospital,
your father may

304
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:02,811
not notice how tired
you mother's becoming.

305
00:37:02,993 --> 00:37:06,174
So we have to make sure he
does not overstay his welcome.

306
00:37:06,573 --> 00:37:08,883
Not that that's been a historically problem.

307
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:12,591
No eggs.
You already had eggs twice this week.

308
00:37:12,885 --> 00:37:14,307
If you are getting hungry,

309
00:37:14,507 --> 00:37:16,967
there is spinach in the
fridge you can steam.

310
00:37:17,098 --> 00:37:19,032
Yeah, sure.

311
00:37:19,201 --> 00:37:20,587
Don't touch anything.

312
00:37:23,124 --> 00:37:26,591
I will do my very best not to.

313
00:38:00,768 --> 00:38:02,268
Get it.

314
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,892
Dad.

315
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,392
Oh.

316
00:40:15,404 --> 00:40:17,224
How are you doing, Con? You look tired.

317
00:40:17,392 --> 00:40:18,516
I'm fine.

318
00:40:18,684 --> 00:40:21,516
Mum's on this new medicine.
And it will make her better.

319
00:40:21,684 --> 00:40:24,560
She goes to the hospital
every two weeks...

320
00:40:24,724 --> 00:40:29,600
and they pump the medicine
into her bloodstream.

321
00:40:29,768 --> 00:40:33,532
She's sick for the next few days,
but she's better again.

322
00:40:40,516 --> 00:40:45,176
- Your sister is doing better.
- Half sister.

323
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,308
Yeah.

324
00:40:47,476 --> 00:40:49,392
I'd still love you to meet her.

325
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:53,892
I've been talking with your grandmother
about bringing you out to LA.

326
00:40:54,766 --> 00:40:57,616
- You want me to come to LA?
- Yeah absolutely.

327
00:40:57,684 --> 00:41:00,046
- You'd like that wouldn't you?
- Yeah.

328
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,254
We were thinking over Christmas,

329
00:41:01,454 --> 00:41:03,184
that way you can be back
here in time for school.

330
00:41:05,448 --> 00:41:07,204
So you mean just for a visit then?

331
00:41:07,404 --> 00:41:09,057
Yeah, but it would be great.

332
00:41:09,989 --> 00:41:11,883
I don't want to live with grandma.

333
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:14,756
It's an old lady's house
with old ladies' things.

334
00:41:14,816 --> 00:41:16,667
Can't touch anything
or sit anywhere.

335
00:41:16,867 --> 00:41:18,868
Can't even leave a
mess for two seconds.

336
00:41:18,932 --> 00:41:19,894
Conor, I know, but...

337
00:41:20,094 --> 00:41:23,113
I want to have my own room in my
my own house with my own things.

338
00:41:23,213 --> 00:41:24,320
Well, you wouldn't have
that in America, Conor.

339
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,700
There is barely enough
room for the three of us.

340
00:41:25,768 --> 00:41:27,308
- I do not care.
- Conor listen...

341
00:41:27,476 --> 00:41:30,060
- She's so strict.
- Your family, your life, your friends...

342
00:41:30,224 --> 00:41:33,932
- Her house is like a museum.
- Your school, all of it is here, okay?

343
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,739
It would be unfair to
take you out of here.

344
00:41:35,939 --> 00:41:36,992
Unfair to whom?
Conor.

345
00:41:49,348 --> 00:41:52,184
Doesn't look like your
grandmother's home yet.

346
00:41:52,348 --> 00:41:56,348
She sometimes goes back to the
hospital after I go to bed.

347
00:41:56,516 --> 00:41:59,016
The nurses let her sleep in a chair.

348
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:00,727
Hey, just because your grandmother

349
00:42:00,927 --> 00:42:03,060
doesn't like me,
doesn't make her a bad person.

350
00:42:03,224 --> 00:42:05,100
She says you're all start and no finish.

351
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,600
Well, she entitled to her own opinion.

352
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,932
How long are you here for?

353
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,768
As long as I can be.

354
00:42:16,932 --> 00:42:18,600
What does that mean?

355
00:42:19,268 --> 00:42:23,392
We don't have a lot of money and
Americans don't get a lot of holiday.

356
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:26,173
- You're not an American.
- No, but I live there now.

357
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,272
I'll come back whenever I need to.

358
00:42:29,472 --> 00:42:31,684
And you're going to come
to LA for Christmas.

359
00:42:31,848 --> 00:42:33,932
God no, not in your cramped house
where there is no room for me.

360
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,620
Why did you come?

361
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,724
Conor wait.

362
00:42:52,516 --> 00:42:54,724
Conor, I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

363
00:42:54,892 --> 00:42:57,124
There's still loads of time.

364
00:44:45,348 --> 00:44:48,848
As destruction goes,
that was remarkably pitiful.

365
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,060
Now, I've come to tell you the second tale.

366
00:44:53,224 --> 00:44:54,768
Is it as bad as the last one?

367
00:44:54,932 --> 00:44:58,932
It ends with proper destruction,
if that's what you mean.

368
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,060
It's about a man who
thought only of himself...

369
00:45:02,224 --> 00:45:04,932
a man who wasn't as generous
as he should have been.

370
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,932
A man who gets punished very badly indeed.

371
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,100
Stories aren't real though.

372
00:45:10,268 --> 00:45:11,600
They don't help anything.

373
00:45:11,768 --> 00:45:14,348
Stories are wild creatures, Conor O'Malley.

374
00:45:14,516 --> 00:45:15,686
When you let them lose,

375
00:45:15,886 --> 00:45:17,768
who knows what havoc
they might reek?

376
00:45:17,932 --> 00:45:19,516
Oh yes.

377
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,724
Okay.

378
00:45:23,892 --> 00:45:25,648
Go on then.

379
00:45:26,516 --> 00:45:28,048
Good.

380
00:46:06,687 --> 00:46:08,472
150 years ago...

381
00:46:09,068 --> 00:46:10,870
The future came.

382
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:14,790
Factories grew like weeds.

383
00:46:16,471 --> 00:46:18,978
trees fell, rivers blackened...

384
00:46:19,013 --> 00:46:21,928
and the sky choked on smoke and ash.

385
00:46:23,875 --> 00:46:27,377
But there was still green
if you knew where to look.

386
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:31,414
On the edge of this town
lived a stubborn man.

387
00:46:32,493 --> 00:46:34,316
Who refused to change.

388
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,032
He daunted on the old ways of medicine...

389
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,616
herbs and barks and concoctions
brewed from berries and leafs.

390
00:46:43,784 --> 00:46:47,240
Villagers ever only
called him the apothecary.

391
00:46:47,408 --> 00:46:49,492
- The what?
- The apothecary.

392
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,769
An old-fashioned name for 'pharmacist'.

393
00:46:51,804 --> 00:46:54,024
Why didn't you just say?

394
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:02,317
There was also a young
parson in this village,

395
00:47:02,517 --> 00:47:04,516
an enligthned man
and a kind one...

396
00:47:04,684 --> 00:47:08,516
who just wanted the very
best for his congregation.

397
00:47:09,485 --> 00:47:12,659
He preached against the
apothecary's use of the old ways...

398
00:47:12,694 --> 00:47:15,812
and the apothecary's
foul temper and greed...

399
00:47:15,813 --> 00:47:19,848
made certain some of these
sermons fell on eager ears.

400
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:28,060
Much as he tried to keep on
helping the community...

401
00:47:28,224 --> 00:47:34,060
his business sank which
only made him grow bitter

402
00:47:36,848 --> 00:47:40,932
On the parsonage's ground
there also lived a yew tree.

403
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:43,970
That's the hill where you live.

404
00:47:44,005 --> 00:47:46,315
The yew tree is the most
important of the healing trees.

405
00:47:46,515 --> 00:47:47,625
Why?

406
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:52,100
Its berries, its bark,
they brum and burn and twist with life.

407
00:47:52,268 --> 00:47:55,434
That can cure almost any ailment.

408
00:47:55,469 --> 00:47:56,947
Really? Anything?

409
00:47:56,982 --> 00:48:01,184
Anything that can be cured if
mixed by the right apothecary.

410
00:48:09,184 --> 00:48:12,432
The apothecary wanted
the yew tree very badly.

411
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:16,392
But in order to harvest these things,
he would have to cut it down.

412
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,560
And this, the parson would not allow.

413
00:48:26,932 --> 00:48:30,383
The parson had two daughters
who were the light of his life.

414
00:48:30,418 --> 00:48:34,848
He was a caring, loving father who
would've done anything for their sake.

415
00:48:35,016 --> 00:48:40,268
But one day both little girls were
struck by a terrible sickness...

416
00:48:41,115 --> 00:48:43,254
and nothing the parson did helped.

417
00:48:43,836 --> 00:48:47,999
No cure from the more modern doctors,
no prayer, nothing.

418
00:48:56,593 --> 00:49:00,091
There was no choice but to
approach the apothecary.

419
00:49:02,574 --> 00:49:05,308
"Will you not help my daughters?".
The parson begged.

420
00:49:05,476 --> 00:49:09,060
"Will you not save two innocent girls?"

421
00:49:10,522 --> 00:49:13,060
"Why should I?". Said the apothecary.

422
00:49:13,224 --> 00:49:16,616
"You have driven away my
business with your preachings...

423
00:49:16,651 --> 00:49:20,844
and you have refused me the yew tree,
my best source of healing".

424
00:49:21,848 --> 00:49:24,700
"You may have the yew tree,"
said the parson.

425
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,591
"I will preach sermons in your favour.

426
00:49:26,626 --> 00:49:29,892
I will do anything only you
will save my daughters."

427
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:35,099
"Would you give up everything you
believe in?". Said the apothecary.

428
00:49:35,224 --> 00:49:38,932
"If it would save them,
I would give up everything."

429
00:49:39,432 --> 00:49:42,939
"Then there's nothing I can do to help you."

430
00:50:07,216 --> 00:50:10,195
The very next day both of
the parson's daughters died.

431
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:14,193
- What?
- And that night I came walking.

432
00:50:14,228 --> 00:50:17,476
Good.
He deserves all the punishment he gets.

433
00:50:18,278 --> 00:50:21,379
Indeed. It was shortly after midnight...

434
00:50:21,414 --> 00:50:24,060
That I tore the house of the
parson from its very foundations.

435
00:50:24,224 --> 00:50:27,091
The parson? What are you talking about?

436
00:50:27,126 --> 00:50:29,128
The apothecary is the evil one.

437
00:50:29,163 --> 00:50:33,016
He was greedy and rude,
but he was still a healer.

438
00:50:33,184 --> 00:50:35,348
The parson, what was he?

439
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,066
A man of faith without faith.

440
00:50:49,151 --> 00:50:50,803
Belief is half of all healing.

441
00:50:50,838 --> 00:50:54,408
Belief in the cure,
belief in the future that awaits.

442
00:50:54,443 --> 00:50:57,258
Your belief is precious...

443
00:50:57,259 --> 00:51:03,014
so you must be careful where
you put it and in whom.

444
00:51:04,888 --> 00:51:07,889
Tell me, Conor O'Malley,
what shall I destroy next?

445
00:51:07,924 --> 00:51:10,923
- What?
- It is most satisfying, I can assure you.

446
00:51:10,958 --> 00:51:14,060
Tell me. What should I destroy?

447
00:51:16,439 --> 00:51:18,195
Smack the chimney?

448
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:19,308
The chimney.

449
00:51:21,294 --> 00:51:22,316
Next?

450
00:51:23,258 --> 00:51:24,328
Throw away their beds.

451
00:51:29,787 --> 00:51:31,082
Smash the furniture.

452
00:51:40,288 --> 00:51:41,560
Break the windows.

453
00:51:41,595 --> 00:51:43,348
Windows.

454
00:51:44,805 --> 00:51:46,768
Break them yourself.

455
00:51:50,076 --> 00:51:51,232
Come one.

456
00:52:02,424 --> 00:52:03,706
Harder, Conor O'Malley.

457
00:52:03,741 --> 00:52:05,524
Come on. Harder.

458
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:06,775
That's it.

459
00:52:08,069 --> 00:52:09,368
Yes.

460
00:52:11,516 --> 00:52:12,932
Feels good doesn't it?

461
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,324
Yeah.

462
00:54:04,224 --> 00:54:07,391
Grandma.

463
00:54:07,929 --> 00:54:09,555
Grandma.

464
00:54:10,655 --> 00:54:13,056
Grandma, please...

465
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:54,250
Grandma.

466
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:56,814
I heard you like them sunny side up.

467
00:55:56,909 --> 00:56:00,648
- What are you doing here?
- What do you think?

468
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:07,119
Your grandmother called
very early this morning.

469
00:56:09,522 --> 00:56:11,348
She's gone to the hospital to see your mum.

470
00:56:11,548 --> 00:56:13,374
Your mum's had a bad turn, Con.

471
00:56:16,288 --> 00:56:18,474
I need to see her.

472
00:56:18,477 --> 00:56:20,292
We'll see what happens today,
and maybe you can

473
00:56:20,492 --> 00:56:22,306
visit for a little while this afternoon.

474
00:56:28,589 --> 00:56:31,033
I can see how upset you are.

475
00:56:33,824 --> 00:56:37,341
I didn't mean to.
I don't know what happened.

476
00:56:37,509 --> 00:56:41,639
- Worse things happen at sea.
- What do you mean?

477
00:56:41,807 --> 00:56:43,669
Aren't you going to punish me?

478
00:56:43,672 --> 00:56:46,083
What could possibly be the point in that?

479
00:56:53,863 --> 00:56:57,968
I got to say champ,
this is really just amazingly thorough.

480
00:57:04,044 --> 00:57:06,380
Oh, a buried treasure.

481
00:57:07,032 --> 00:57:09,561
These must be those home
movies that your mother

482
00:57:09,761 --> 00:57:12,289
used to send when
I first moved away.

483
00:57:12,292 --> 00:57:14,070
Why did you move away?

484
00:57:17,364 --> 00:57:19,460
We were young.

485
00:57:19,463 --> 00:57:22,525
Too young, you know?
We had big dreams, and...

486
00:57:22,528 --> 00:57:25,840
- What kind of dreams?
- Your mother wanted to go to art college.

487
00:57:29,301 --> 00:57:33,155
- Really?
- Yeah. She didn't go, but she wanted to.

488
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,526
What happened?

489
00:57:36,573 --> 00:57:38,475
Because mum got pregnant with me.

490
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:42,697
Mum never regretted having you.
You were only ever good news.

491
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:47,194
And I know that for a fact, because the
one thing she regretted was marrying me.

492
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:50,814
- Why did she marry you then?
- Because I'm handsome.

493
00:57:55,780 --> 00:58:00,787
Your mum was amazing.
And she still is. And we were in love.

494
00:58:01,337 --> 00:58:04,946
I mean, I still love her.
But you will see that...

495
00:58:07,481 --> 00:58:11,300
love isn't enough.
It doesn't carry you through.

496
00:58:12,381 --> 00:58:15,292
So you didn't get happily ever after.

497
00:58:15,295 --> 00:58:17,788
No, but that's life, you know?

498
00:58:19,208 --> 00:58:24,580
Most of it just get messier after.
And that's alright.

499
00:58:28,531 --> 00:58:31,661
Even I'm happy you turned out like her.

500
00:59:31,021 --> 00:59:33,824
You're telling what to do now?
I can pull him in any direction.

501
00:59:34,024 --> 00:59:35,827
You can take him out of school then...

502
00:59:42,016 --> 00:59:43,422
Thank you.

503
00:59:47,174 --> 00:59:49,250
I'm looking for something to eat.
You want something, kid?

504
00:59:49,450 --> 00:59:50,925
Stop calling me 'kid'.

505
00:59:51,536 --> 00:59:53,472
Fair enough.

506
00:59:57,767 --> 00:59:59,805
I'm sorry, Lizzie.

507
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:08,819
Who was that man in a suit?

508
01:00:09,328 --> 01:00:11,498
Just...

509
01:00:11,666 --> 01:00:13,044
Nothing.

510
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:15,990
- What happened this morning?
- Nothing.

511
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:19,385
It's fine.

512
01:00:23,098 --> 01:00:26,850
I had a bit of a bad reaction.

513
01:00:32,037 --> 01:00:34,142
There's one more thing
they're going to try,

514
01:00:34,342 --> 01:00:36,446
and it's a medicine that's
had some really good results.

515
01:00:36,449 --> 01:00:38,672
Why didn't they try it in the first place?

516
01:00:38,675 --> 01:00:41,050
Because this is something
you take when the other

517
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:43,624
stuff hasn't worked the
way they wanted it to.

518
01:00:46,055 --> 01:00:47,568
Does that mean it's too late?

519
01:00:47,768 --> 01:00:49,881
No of course it doesn't
mean it's too late.

520
01:00:50,049 --> 01:00:51,660
Are you sure?

521
01:00:52,805 --> 01:00:55,593
I believe every word I say.

522
01:00:58,994 --> 01:01:01,502
Belief is half of all healing.

523
01:01:04,399 --> 01:01:09,032
Belief in the cure,
belief in the future that awaits.

524
01:01:10,961 --> 01:01:12,095
Yeah.

525
01:01:15,458 --> 01:01:18,611
And you know that tree
I'm always going on about?

526
01:01:18,614 --> 01:01:20,077
Yeah.

527
01:01:20,277 --> 01:01:23,939
Well,
this drug is made from trees like that.

528
01:01:24,009 --> 01:01:25,427
- It is?
- Yeah.

529
01:01:25,596 --> 01:01:26,953
Seriously?

530
01:01:27,153 --> 01:01:30,309
All this time we could have gone
out there and just chopped it down.

531
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,340
But not that one.

532
01:01:37,667 --> 01:01:39,886
That one's our friend.

533
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,655
Where are you?

534
01:02:20,665 --> 01:02:22,024
I'm here.

535
01:02:24,442 --> 01:02:27,207
Can you do it? Can you make my mum better?

536
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:30,372
If your mother can be healed,
the yew tree will do it.

537
01:02:33,212 --> 01:02:37,544
- So that's a yes?
- You still don't know why you called me.

538
01:02:37,547 --> 01:02:41,292
I didn't call you.
And even if I did, it was obviously for mum.

539
01:02:41,295 --> 01:02:42,768
- Was it?
- What else?

540
01:02:42,775 --> 01:02:45,277
To listen to idiotic
stories that make no sense.

541
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:50,334
It is not yet time for the third tale.
But soon. And after that...

542
01:02:50,337 --> 01:02:53,136
you will tell me your story, Conor O'Malley.

543
01:02:53,139 --> 01:02:55,576
No.

544
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:58,913
No, not this. That's just a nightmare.

545
01:02:59,082 --> 01:03:01,542
No, please.

546
01:03:04,742 --> 01:03:08,096
That's not my truth.
That's just a nightmare.

547
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:11,434
Nevertheless,
this will happen after the third tale.

548
01:03:11,602 --> 01:03:13,808
I want to know what's going
to happen with my mum.

549
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:17,750
Do not waste the precious
time that is given you.

550
01:03:17,753 --> 01:03:20,741
Wait. Where are you going?

551
01:03:20,905 --> 01:03:23,548
If you are a tree of healing,
then I need you to heal.

552
01:03:25,418 --> 01:03:27,625
And so I shall.

553
01:03:57,764 --> 01:04:03,017
Conor, I'll come back. I promise, alright.
And you'll come to LA for Christmas.

554
01:04:03,085 --> 01:04:05,582
I wont leave mum alone for Christmas.

555
01:04:05,645 --> 01:04:09,027
- Conor this medicine your mum's taking...
- Is going to make her well.

556
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:11,084
No, Conor, it probably isn't.

557
01:04:11,087 --> 01:04:13,281
- Yes it is.
- No, it's a last stage effort, son.

558
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:15,869
It will heal her. I know it.

559
01:04:16,898 --> 01:04:19,144
It is the reason it came. It has to.

560
01:04:19,147 --> 01:04:21,893
- Reason what came?
- The monster.

561
01:04:21,896 --> 01:04:23,984
- Conor, what?
- It comes to 12h07.

562
01:04:23,996 --> 01:04:26,533
At first I thought it was a dream,
but there is always...

563
01:04:26,703 --> 01:04:28,265
Stop. It is a dream.

564
01:04:28,434 --> 01:04:30,759
That's all it is.
I'm sorry you have to face this...

565
01:04:30,809 --> 01:04:33,071
but you have to be brave.

566
01:04:33,774 --> 01:04:36,527
Do you understand?

567
01:04:37,469 --> 01:04:39,163
Come on.

568
01:04:40,183 --> 01:04:41,586
Come on.

569
01:04:51,855 --> 01:04:53,979
I'll be back as soon as I can.

570
01:04:54,425 --> 01:04:57,075
What if it's not fast enough?

571
01:05:02,568 --> 01:05:03,654
Conor, listen...

572
01:05:03,823 --> 01:05:07,120
- It's okay.
- What is okay?

573
01:05:07,288 --> 01:05:08,740
Just...

574
01:05:08,743 --> 01:05:10,934
You don't have to.

575
01:06:19,043 --> 01:06:21,632
Look. Do you see it?

576
01:06:21,796 --> 01:06:23,635
Do you see it? Can you wave?

577
01:06:23,799 --> 01:06:26,640
Can you see him?

578
01:06:26,804 --> 01:06:31,231
And then we wave to grandma.

579
01:06:34,653 --> 01:06:36,488
Hello grandma.

580
01:06:36,656 --> 01:06:38,907
Con, you can say hello to grandma and mum?

581
01:06:39,076 --> 01:06:41,247
Hello Grandma.

582
01:06:41,411 --> 01:06:43,667
Here we go.

583
01:06:43,831 --> 01:06:46,672
Mum has heard this many times.

584
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:48,575
Are you ready?

585
01:06:48,739 --> 01:06:50,911
Con, come sit here.

586
01:06:51,079 --> 01:06:53,747
Con, look.

587
01:06:53,916 --> 01:06:56,588
- Hello grandma.
- Mama...

588
01:06:56,752 --> 01:06:58,756
- one...
- Mama.

589
01:06:58,924 --> 01:07:01,203
There we go.

590
01:07:01,206 --> 01:07:03,848
We are doing your picture, grandma.

591
01:07:04,016 --> 01:07:06,853
And then mix it together.

592
01:07:07,021 --> 01:07:08,523
What color is that?

593
01:07:09,092 --> 01:07:10,426
Brown.

594
01:07:13,031 --> 01:07:14,865
- It is a nice lodgy brown.
- Brown.

595
01:07:15,034 --> 01:07:17,870
- But we have brown here.
- That's true.

596
01:07:18,039 --> 01:07:21,336
What can you see?

597
01:07:21,504 --> 01:07:24,509
What is that? What are those?

598
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:26,677
What do you... What are these?

599
01:07:26,845 --> 01:07:29,890
- Eyes.
- Eyes. That's it.

600
01:07:30,058 --> 01:07:32,646
Life is always in the eyes.

601
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:35,735
If you get that...

602
01:07:35,738 --> 01:07:38,319
you will be a proper artist.

603
01:07:38,767 --> 01:07:40,642
Yes.

604
01:07:41,036 --> 01:07:43,788
Look.

605
01:07:43,956 --> 01:07:45,791
This is how we draw the eyes in...

606
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:50,039
because this is where the
eyes catch the reflection.

607
01:07:51,092 --> 01:07:54,930
There we see the life in the eyes. See that?

608
01:07:55,098 --> 01:07:59,814
Do it again. It's life.

609
01:08:02,819 --> 01:08:06,240
Maybe if we take a pencil...

610
01:08:06,408 --> 01:08:10,082
and you can draw on that...

611
01:08:10,247 --> 01:08:12,502
Do you want to try it?

612
01:08:12,667 --> 01:08:14,880
Show me how you do it.

613
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:30,740
Look, Con.

614
01:08:30,904 --> 01:08:35,912
That's his hair and this is his eyebrow.

615
01:08:37,374 --> 01:08:40,047
There's the eyes.

616
01:08:40,211 --> 01:08:42,967
Oh look, there's his mouth.

617
01:08:43,136 --> 01:08:46,806
There's his mouth. He is very angry.

618
01:08:46,974 --> 01:08:49,145
Can you see?

619
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:51,898
Look at that.

620
01:08:52,466 --> 01:08:56,684
And then we start to make a face.

621
01:08:56,687 --> 01:08:58,741
And then...

622
01:08:58,909 --> 01:09:01,165
there's our monster.

623
01:09:01,329 --> 01:09:02,915
There's the monster.

624
01:09:03,084 --> 01:09:05,672
Look at the monster.

625
01:09:40,099 --> 01:09:42,103
Very slowly.

626
01:09:43,689 --> 01:09:45,692
That's it.

627
01:09:49,366 --> 01:09:51,618
That's it, okay.

628
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:05,140
Okay, so 30 minutes exam this morning...

629
01:10:05,308 --> 01:10:09,146
and this is all the stuff we've
been doing for the last two weeks.

630
01:10:09,314 --> 01:10:13,786
So if you've done your revision,
there will be no surprises.

631
01:10:18,329 --> 01:10:21,596
So in a moment I'm going to ask
you to turn your pages over.

632
01:10:21,599 --> 01:10:27,673
There will be no talking for the next
30 minutes. I want total silence...

633
01:10:27,676 --> 01:10:31,975
because you are going to use your brains,
not your mouths.

634
01:10:32,143 --> 01:10:34,395
So 30 minutes...

635
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:37,235
Starting now. Good luck.

636
01:11:03,976 --> 01:11:07,437
I think I've finally figures you out.

637
01:11:07,505 --> 01:11:10,008
After all this time.

638
01:11:10,172 --> 01:11:14,599
All you're looking for is
someone kick your head in.

639
01:11:14,763 --> 01:11:16,265
But you know what?

640
01:11:16,433 --> 01:11:19,437
I'm not that guy anymore.

641
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,623
Goodbye, O'Malley.

642
01:11:27,656 --> 01:11:30,412
I no longer see you.

643
01:11:30,576 --> 01:11:33,740
Now you're invisible to me too.

644
01:11:34,706 --> 01:11:37,100
I hope your mum gets better.

645
01:12:01,857 --> 01:12:03,880
What took you so long?

646
01:12:03,883 --> 01:12:07,206
It's time for the third tale.

647
01:12:10,006 --> 01:12:13,332
There was once an invisible man...

648
01:12:13,335 --> 01:12:16,515
who was grown tired of being unseen.

649
01:12:16,684 --> 01:12:20,481
It was not that he was actually invisible.

650
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:25,944
It was just the people had
become used to not seeing him.

651
01:12:26,112 --> 01:12:30,951
One day,
the invisible man couldn't stand it anymore.

652
01:12:31,119 --> 01:12:35,874
He kept wondering, if no one sees you...

653
01:12:36,042 --> 01:12:39,547
Are you really there at all?

654
01:12:39,715 --> 01:12:42,551
What did the invisible man do?

655
01:12:43,077 --> 01:12:47,158
He called for a monster.

656
01:13:05,206 --> 01:13:08,318
I don't even know what to say to you,
O'Malley.

657
01:13:09,588 --> 01:13:13,425
You sent him to hospital.

658
01:13:13,593 --> 01:13:16,345
His parents are threatening to sue.

659
01:13:16,513 --> 01:13:19,565
- It wasn't me.
- What was that?

660
01:13:19,568 --> 01:13:22,021
Wasn't me.

661
01:13:25,025 --> 01:13:28,490
I'm not invisible. I'm not invisible.

662
01:13:28,554 --> 01:13:31,300
If you want to be seen, O'Malley,
this is not the best way.

663
01:13:31,303 --> 01:13:36,040
I'm not invisible. Did you hear me?
I'm not invisible.

664
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:40,897
School rules dictate immediately exclusion.

665
01:13:42,465 --> 01:13:47,308
But how could I do that and consider
myself any kind of a teacher?

666
01:13:48,309 --> 01:13:50,022
Go back to class.

667
01:13:50,025 --> 01:13:54,352
We will talk about this one day,
but not today.

668
01:13:54,898 --> 01:13:58,239
You're not punishing me?

669
01:13:58,403 --> 01:14:01,828
What could possibly be the point?

670
01:14:14,593 --> 01:14:17,181
Well, let me give you an
example of emotional wellness.

671
01:14:17,349 --> 01:14:22,436
You know how difficult it is sometimes
to say no. And how good it feels...

672
01:14:22,604 --> 01:14:27,110
When you finally find the courage
to say it anyway. Why is that?

673
01:14:27,837 --> 01:14:29,827
Do you have a moment?

674
01:14:32,994 --> 01:14:34,665
Hoi, wat is is?

675
01:14:34,829 --> 01:14:37,332
We just got a call from the hospital.

676
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:42,547
I am afraid that Conor's mother is not going
to make it. They want him to come there.

677
01:15:11,694 --> 01:15:13,934
Aren't you coming?

678
01:15:14,996 --> 01:15:17,162
I'll be right here.

679
01:15:50,501 --> 01:15:53,117
What did you do to your hands?

680
01:15:59,112 --> 01:16:01,948
It's the talk isn't it?

681
01:16:02,116 --> 01:16:05,329
Everybody wants to have a talk lately.

682
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:11,169
Con...

683
01:16:11,337 --> 01:16:14,341
Look at me.

684
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:20,919
I spoke to the doctor this morning.

685
01:16:26,965 --> 01:16:30,147
The new treatment,
it's... it's not working.

686
01:16:31,156 --> 01:16:34,076
The one from the yew tree?

687
01:16:36,802 --> 01:16:38,058
Yeah.

688
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:41,524
How can it not be working?

689
01:16:41,586 --> 01:16:45,800
Things just happen fast.
Faster than they thought.

690
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:49,221
- How can it not be working?
- I don't know.

691
01:16:49,389 --> 01:16:51,516
It has to.

692
01:16:56,859 --> 01:17:01,029
So what happens now?
What's going to be the next treatment?

693
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:09,284
I'm so sorry.

694
01:17:10,769 --> 01:17:16,006
I've never been more sorry
about anything in my life.

695
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,798
It's okay that you're angry, Con.

696
01:17:30,029 --> 01:17:31,885
It really is.

697
01:17:33,281 --> 01:17:37,256
I'm pretty angry too, to tell you the truth.

698
01:17:38,887 --> 01:17:40,835
But Con...

699
01:17:45,572 --> 01:17:47,944
Con, are you listening?

700
01:17:51,266 --> 01:17:53,458
One day...

701
01:17:54,895 --> 01:17:59,102
if you look back and you feel
bad for being so angry...

702
01:17:59,105 --> 01:18:04,964
you couldn't even speak to me,
you have to know that was okay...

703
01:18:11,377 --> 01:18:14,213
That I knew.

704
01:18:16,666 --> 01:18:22,977
Because I know everything you need to tell
me without you having to say it out loud.

705
01:18:27,399 --> 01:18:30,560
And if you need to break things...

706
01:18:32,362 --> 01:18:35,251
By God you break them.

707
01:18:35,789 --> 01:18:38,769
Break them good and hard.

708
01:18:38,772 --> 01:18:42,167
And I'll be right there, Con.

709
01:18:53,307 --> 01:18:56,549
I wish I had a hundred years.

710
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:05,473
A hundred years I could give to you.

711
01:19:32,573 --> 01:19:34,871
Wake up.

712
01:19:36,412 --> 01:19:38,822
Wake up.

713
01:19:39,390 --> 01:19:44,421
Wake up.

714
01:19:44,589 --> 01:19:49,524
I don't care what time it is.
You lied. Wake up.

715
01:19:51,098 --> 01:19:53,986
Wake up.

716
01:19:55,162 --> 01:19:57,267
I need you now.

717
01:20:09,455 --> 01:20:12,960
- You are doing yourself more pain.
- It did not work.

718
01:20:13,128 --> 01:20:16,088
You said the yew tree would make her better,
but it did not.

719
01:20:16,091 --> 01:20:18,085
Make her better.

720
01:20:20,178 --> 01:20:22,773
You're the one who called me,
Conor O'Malley.

721
01:20:22,973 --> 01:20:26,310
If I called you, it was to save her.
It was to heal her.

722
01:20:26,378 --> 01:20:29,291
- I did not come to heal her.
- Yes you did.

723
01:20:29,391 --> 01:20:30,940
I came to heal you.

724
01:20:31,193 --> 01:20:34,365
Me? I'm not the one who needs healing.

725
01:20:34,529 --> 01:20:37,577
How many times do I have to tell you?

726
01:20:38,326 --> 01:20:40,279
My mum's the one who...

727
01:20:53,884 --> 01:20:55,648
Help me.

728
01:21:02,235 --> 01:21:05,383
It is time for the fourth tale.

729
01:21:08,168 --> 01:21:11,057
No, no please. Get me out of here.

730
01:21:11,156 --> 01:21:15,042
- It is time for your nightmare.
- I need to get back to my mum.

731
01:21:15,045 --> 01:21:17,296
She is already here.

732
01:21:22,026 --> 01:21:23,232
No.

733
01:21:23,596 --> 01:21:25,185
Mum, get out of there.

734
01:21:25,188 --> 01:21:28,896
It is alright.
There is nothing to worry about.

735
01:21:29,064 --> 01:21:31,544
Mum, run. Please, run.

736
01:21:33,278 --> 01:21:34,580
Mum.

737
01:21:42,458 --> 01:21:43,836
Mum.

738
01:21:48,715 --> 01:21:50,009
Conor.

739
01:21:50,177 --> 01:21:51,342
Mum.

740
01:21:53,890 --> 01:21:54,975
No.

741
01:21:55,615 --> 01:21:56,985
Conor.

742
01:21:56,988 --> 01:21:59,690
Mum.

743
01:21:59,854 --> 01:22:00,915
Conor.

744
01:22:00,984 --> 01:22:02,065
Mum.

745
01:22:02,233 --> 01:22:04,028
- Don't let go.
- I won't.

746
01:22:06,199 --> 01:22:09,535
- Conor.
- Mama.

747
01:22:09,704 --> 01:22:10,913
- Mum.
- Conor.

748
01:22:11,077 --> 01:22:13,333
Mum.

749
01:22:13,501 --> 01:22:16,044
Mum, no.

750
01:22:16,213 --> 01:22:19,048
- Mum, no.
- Conor.

751
01:22:21,219 --> 01:22:22,469
Mum.

752
01:22:25,473 --> 01:22:26,811
Mum.

753
01:22:29,439 --> 01:22:30,857
No.

754
01:22:32,735 --> 01:22:36,448
Conor.

755
01:22:36,612 --> 01:22:39,163
- Here is the fourth tale.
- Get help.

756
01:22:39,166 --> 01:22:41,347
Here is the truth of Conor O'Malley.

757
01:22:41,455 --> 01:22:43,582
Mum. No.

758
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:46,294
- Mum.
- Here is your nightmare.

759
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:48,757
- Mum.
- Conor.

760
01:22:48,921 --> 01:22:50,423
Mum.

761
01:22:52,010 --> 01:22:56,892
Save me.

762
01:22:57,060 --> 01:23:01,106
- Conor.
- Mama.

763
01:23:01,274 --> 01:23:04,403
Mama.

764
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:11,660
Mama.

765
01:23:35,105 --> 01:23:37,463
This is when I wake up.

766
01:23:38,826 --> 01:23:41,493
This is when I always wake up.

767
01:23:42,121 --> 01:23:44,414
The tale is not yet told.

768
01:23:44,582 --> 01:23:46,720
Get me out of here.
I need to see my mum.

769
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:48,458
She is no longer here, Conor.

770
01:23:48,464 --> 01:23:50,906
She fell. I could not
hold onto her anymore.

771
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:52,631
Conor.

772
01:23:52,885 --> 01:23:55,758
- Speak the truth.
- No.

773
01:23:55,761 --> 01:23:58,760
You will speak the truth or you
will never leave this place.

774
01:23:58,817 --> 01:24:01,255
What truth? I do not know
what you mean.

775
01:24:01,281 --> 01:24:03,931
You must tell me the fourth tale,
Conor O'Malley.

776
01:24:04,131 --> 01:24:06,780
You must tell me your nightmare
before it is too late.

777
01:24:06,948 --> 01:24:10,093
Yes. Tell me, Conor. Tell me the truth.

778
01:24:10,096 --> 01:24:14,290
- It will kill me if I do.
- It will kill you if you do not.

779
01:24:14,458 --> 01:24:15,708
Speak the truth.

780
01:24:15,876 --> 01:24:17,661
- No.
- The truth, Conor O'Malley.

781
01:24:17,712 --> 01:24:19,674
- Tell me the truth, boy.
- No.

782
01:24:19,739 --> 01:24:24,748
- Speak the truth.
- No.

783
01:24:24,751 --> 01:24:26,950
Speak the truth, boy.

784
01:24:26,953 --> 01:24:29,103
I want it to be over.

785
01:24:40,782 --> 01:24:44,956
I can't stand knowing she will go.

786
01:24:45,124 --> 01:24:49,294
I want it to be finished.
I let her fall.

787
01:24:49,462 --> 01:24:51,633
I let her die.

788
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:18,919
That was brave, Conor.

789
01:25:19,087 --> 01:25:21,839
You finally said it.

790
01:25:23,425 --> 01:25:25,325
Why didn't it kill me?

791
01:25:26,429 --> 01:25:28,710
I deserve punishment.

792
01:25:29,433 --> 01:25:31,508
I deserve the worst.

793
01:25:32,273 --> 01:25:33,936
Do you?

794
01:25:35,694 --> 01:25:39,447
I've known forever that she
wasn't going to make it.

795
01:25:40,116 --> 01:25:43,410
She keep telling me she was
getting better all the time...

796
01:25:44,622 --> 01:25:47,001
because that's what I wanted to hear.

797
01:25:47,794 --> 01:25:50,056
And I believed her.

798
01:25:51,215 --> 01:25:53,574
Except I didn't.

799
01:25:57,556 --> 01:26:01,635
And I started to think how
much I wanted it to be over.

800
01:26:02,161 --> 01:26:04,431
I couldn't...

801
01:26:04,434 --> 01:26:07,631
I couldn't stand how alone
that would make me feel.

802
01:26:08,655 --> 01:26:13,077
Part of you wished it would end
even if it meant losing her...

803
01:26:16,526 --> 01:26:18,416
I let her go.

804
01:26:19,085 --> 01:26:21,580
I couldn't hold on for longer...

805
01:26:22,422 --> 01:26:25,093
but I always let her go.

806
01:26:25,262 --> 01:26:30,268
And that is your truth, Conor O'Malley.

807
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:35,503
I don't want it to be though.

808
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:37,761
Now it's for real.

809
01:26:38,095 --> 01:26:40,484
Now she's going to die and it's my fault.

810
01:26:40,908 --> 01:26:44,002
Now, that is not the truth at all.

811
01:26:44,163 --> 01:26:48,109
You were merely wishing for an end of pain.
Your own pain.

812
01:26:48,201 --> 01:26:50,207
It is the most human wish there is.

813
01:26:50,304 --> 01:26:51,618
I didn't mean it though.

814
01:26:51,714 --> 01:26:54,680
You did, but you also did not.

815
01:26:58,684 --> 01:27:00,057
How can both be true?

816
01:27:00,225 --> 01:27:04,023
How can a prince be a murderer
and beloved by his people?

817
01:27:04,191 --> 01:27:08,063
How can an apothecary be evil
tempted but right thinking?

818
01:27:08,137 --> 01:27:12,127
How can invisible men make
themselves lonelier by being seen?

819
01:27:12,130 --> 01:27:15,538
I don't know.
Your stories never made sense to me.

820
01:27:15,707 --> 01:27:18,543
Because humans are complicated beasts.

821
01:27:18,711 --> 01:27:21,241
You believe comforting lies,
while knowing full well...

822
01:27:21,441 --> 01:27:23,971
the painful truth that
makes those lies necessary.

823
01:27:24,493 --> 01:27:29,225
In the end, Conor,
it is not important what you think.

824
01:27:29,389 --> 01:27:33,271
It is only important what you do.

825
01:27:33,439 --> 01:27:35,149
So what do I do?

826
01:27:35,313 --> 01:27:38,486
What you did just now.
You speak the truth.

827
01:27:38,654 --> 01:27:39,948
That's all?

828
01:27:40,112 --> 01:27:41,614
You think it's easy?

829
01:27:41,782 --> 01:27:44,582
You were willing to die
rather than speak it.

830
01:27:46,645 --> 01:27:50,542
I'm so tired. So tired of all this.

831
01:27:50,711 --> 01:27:53,557
Then sleep. There is time.

832
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:56,396
Are you sure? I need to see my mum.

833
01:27:56,763 --> 01:28:00,432
- We will both see her tonight.
- Will you be there?

834
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:02,519
Yes.

835
01:28:02,687 --> 01:28:05,290
It will be the final steps of my walking.

836
01:28:09,028 --> 01:28:11,367
How does the fourth story end?

837
01:28:13,366 --> 01:28:15,204
Sleep.

838
01:28:16,142 --> 01:28:17,686
Sleep.

839
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:20,467
Sleep.

840
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:57,685
Thank God. Conor! Conor!

841
01:29:00,216 --> 01:29:02,430
I've been out of my mind trying to find you.

842
01:29:02,598 --> 01:29:06,315
- There was something I had to do.
- No time. We have to go now.

843
01:29:29,203 --> 01:29:31,168
Damn it.

844
01:29:36,087 --> 01:29:37,507
Grandma.

845
01:29:38,935 --> 01:29:40,984
I'm sorry.

846
01:29:41,149 --> 01:29:45,425
About the living room and the everything.

847
01:29:47,541 --> 01:29:49,546
It doesn't matter.

848
01:29:50,548 --> 01:29:52,970
It doesn't matter.

849
01:30:06,712 --> 01:30:09,865
You know, Conor. You and me...

850
01:30:10,766 --> 01:30:14,132
we're not the most natural fit, are we?

851
01:30:15,086 --> 01:30:16,856
No.

852
01:30:16,865 --> 01:30:18,220
I guess not.

853
01:30:18,284 --> 01:30:20,693
I guess not either.

854
01:30:22,042 --> 01:30:24,393
But we're going to have to learn.

855
01:30:26,805 --> 01:30:29,897
- I know.
- You do know, don't you.

856
01:30:30,061 --> 01:30:32,527
Of course you do.

857
01:30:37,079 --> 01:30:40,069
But there is one thing we have in common.

858
01:30:41,297 --> 01:30:43,124
Your mum.

859
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:50,989
That's what we have in common.

860
01:32:06,715 --> 01:32:08,263
It's okay.

861
01:32:08,428 --> 01:32:10,207
I see you found him.

862
01:32:11,435 --> 01:32:12,970
Thank you.

863
01:32:19,832 --> 01:32:21,793
Hello my darling.

864
01:32:22,591 --> 01:32:25,181
- Mum?
- Yes, I'm here.

865
01:32:25,345 --> 01:32:27,580
I'm here. Can you feel my hand?

866
01:32:28,770 --> 01:32:31,196
Conor's here too.

867
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,325
- Is he?
- Yes.

868
01:32:38,963 --> 01:32:41,385
Conor.

869
01:33:17,349 --> 01:33:20,273
Here is the end of the tale.

870
01:33:22,278 --> 01:33:24,114
I'm afraid.

871
01:33:24,282 --> 01:33:26,540
Of course you're afraid.

872
01:33:27,583 --> 01:33:31,377
It will be hard. It will be more than hard.

873
01:33:32,563 --> 01:33:36,123
But you will make it through,
Conor O'Malley.

874
01:33:36,773 --> 01:33:38,738
You'll stay?

875
01:33:39,570 --> 01:33:42,031
I will be right here.

876
01:33:50,262 --> 01:33:52,166
What do I do?

877
01:33:52,823 --> 01:33:58,255
Now all that is left is for you to
speak the simplest truth of all.

878
01:34:19,864 --> 01:34:21,700
I don't want you to go.

879
01:34:21,969 --> 01:34:24,776
I know, sweetheart.

880
01:34:30,831 --> 01:34:33,004
I don't want you to go.

881
01:35:39,147 --> 01:35:41,371
How does the fourth story end?

882
01:35:41,496 --> 01:35:45,436
It ends with a boy holding
on tight to his mother.

883
01:35:45,572 --> 01:35:47,413
And by doing so...

884
01:35:47,568 --> 01:35:51,464
he can finally let her go.

885
01:36:33,749 --> 01:36:35,754
Conor.

886
01:36:42,788 --> 01:36:45,210
This is your room now.

887
01:36:45,279 --> 01:36:47,617
I'm making it ready.

888
01:36:52,179 --> 01:36:53,672
Thank you.
