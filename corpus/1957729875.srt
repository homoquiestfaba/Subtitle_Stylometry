>> Where is she now, Bill?

184
00:16:05,275 --> 00:16:07,172
>> She's in Sunset hospital.

185
00:16:07,206 --> 00:16:09,724
>> Okay, I'm going there
right now.

186
00:16:09,758 --> 00:16:11,413
>> I'll be there later.

[dramatic music]

188
00:16:28,724 --> 00:16:30,000
>> Dirk, thank God you're here.

189
00:16:30,034 --> 00:16:32,000
We've tried you so many times.

190
00:16:35,344 --> 00:16:38,206
>> Mr. Longstreet,

191
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:40,793
I'm not going to pull
any punches with you

192
00:16:40,827 --> 00:16:42,689
she could still leave us.

193
00:16:42,724 --> 00:16:45,413
Her coma
is a result of a massive trauma

194
00:16:45,448 --> 00:16:47,448
her body shut down.

195
00:16:50,482 --> 00:16:51,724
>> For how long?

196
00:16:51,758 --> 00:16:55,758
>> Few days,
a week, a year,

197
00:16:55,793 --> 00:16:58,275
her brain has to
turn itself back on.

198
00:17:00,034 --> 00:17:02,241
She's lost a lot of blood.

199
00:17:04,862 --> 00:17:08,517
>> She was uh...>> Raped. Severely.

200
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:18,000
>> She can't have any visitors
until she's out of the ICU,

201
00:17:18,034 --> 00:17:19,862
I'm very sorry.

202
00:17:22,344 --> 00:17:25,137
>> Hey man the cops
want to talk to you

203
00:17:25,172 --> 00:17:27,034
let's go outside
and get some air.

204
00:17:27,068 --> 00:17:28,379
What do you say.

205
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:31,068
Come on.

206
00:17:38,034 --> 00:17:42,000
[dramatic music]

207
00:17:50,931 --> 00:17:52,551
>> I made some of those
changes that you asked for.

208
00:17:52,586 --> 00:17:53,586
>> I like that, that looks,

209
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,275
just flip that last...>> Hi Dirk.

210
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,000
>> I need to talk to you.

211
00:17:58,034 --> 00:18:00,275
>> Just keep doing
what we talked about

212
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,758
switch the paragraphs over.>> Okay!

213
00:18:01,793 --> 00:18:03,413
>> Hey what's up.

214
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:04,689
>> You know the cops
have no leads

215
00:18:04,724 --> 00:18:07,827
on what happened to Nicole,

216
00:18:07,862 --> 00:18:09,862
so I guess it's up to us.

217
00:18:09,896 --> 00:18:11,551
>> You have a plan?

218
00:18:11,586 --> 00:18:14,517
>> No, I'm sure you have some
favors you can ask, hmm,

219
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,758
some strings you can pull.

220
00:18:16,793 --> 00:18:20,586
I know you're never
without an angle. Right?

221
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,000
>> Can I quote you on that?

222
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:24,827
>> Sure you can.

223
00:18:24,862 --> 00:18:26,172
>> Let's go.

224
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:28,931
I'll be back.

225
00:18:31,896 --> 00:18:34,724
>> Hey, hey Mr. Editor

226
00:18:35,206 --> 00:18:37,482
what's the deal.

227
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,827
We don't like
what you wrote about us.

228
00:18:39,862 --> 00:18:43,965
We feel like
you don't understand us.

229
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,517
So if you apologize,

230
00:18:45,551 --> 00:18:47,413
may be you'll live
to see another morning.

231
00:18:47,448 --> 00:18:50,827
>> Yeah and some financial
compensation all right.

232
00:18:50,862 --> 00:18:52,000
>> How much?

233
00:18:52,034 --> 00:18:53,551
>> We'll take
whatever you've got on you.

234
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:56,413
>> And this car
right here homey.

235
00:18:57,275 --> 00:18:58,827
>> I'll take care of that.

236
00:18:58,862 --> 00:19:00,724
>> You pick on him
you pick on me.

237
00:19:00,758 --> 00:19:02,241
>> Come on, mo foo.

238
00:19:11,034 --> 00:19:15,000
[dramatic music]

239
00:19:28,655 --> 00:19:29,827
>> How's that feel?

240
00:19:35,344 --> 00:19:36,689
>> Are you okay?

241
00:19:39,034 --> 00:19:40,000
>> Nice kick.

242
00:19:40,034 --> 00:19:42,689
>> Hey thanks,
I needed the workout.

243
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:45,758
You handled yourself
pretty good back there

244
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:46,931
for a reporter.

245
00:19:46,965 --> 00:19:48,965
>> Well so did you.

246
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,068
Listen I called Bill.

247
00:19:50,103 --> 00:19:52,655
Told him we're going to need
his computer savvy,

248
00:19:52,689 --> 00:19:54,689
he should be able
to help us out.

249
00:20:07,344 --> 00:20:08,310
>> Password needed.

250
00:20:08,344 --> 00:20:10,517
>> Ah no, not again.

251
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:15,931
>> You know what,
I can't get anything

252
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,275
>> Yeah I can't
get in there either.

253

>> Access denied.

254
00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:19,517
>> Are you sure
Bill was coming.

255
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,965
>> Yeah, yeah, I talked to him

256
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,689
he's the guy that installed
the security system

257
00:20:22,724 --> 00:20:24,206
on her computer.

258
00:20:25,241 --> 00:20:26,275
There he is.>> It's about time.

259
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,620
>> Hi Guys.>> Hey Bill.

260
00:20:27,655 --> 00:20:28,931
Good, you brought
your computer right.

261
00:20:28,965 --> 00:20:30,931
>> Yeah!
So how is Nicole doing?"

262
00:20:30,965 --> 00:20:32,551
>> Well she's all right,
well stable,

263
00:20:32,586 --> 00:20:34,379
but they haven't taken her off
the critical list yet.

264
00:20:34,413 --> 00:20:35,586
And because I can't talk to her

265
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,965
I need to get into her computer.

266
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,551
We assumed
you installed it right.

267
00:20:38,586 --> 00:20:40,068
>> Yes I did.

268
00:20:43,206 --> 00:20:45,379
So, what do you want
me to do in there.

269
00:20:45,413 --> 00:20:47,034
>> I'm sure the answer
to what happened to Nicole

270
00:20:47,068 --> 00:20:49,034
is right in this computer.

271
00:20:49,068 --> 00:20:51,827
>> I hope she didn't
change her password.

272
00:20:51,862 --> 00:20:52,965
>> Access denied.

273
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,310
>> Oh, she did.

274
00:20:57,586 --> 00:20:59,655
>> Okay, now I'll try
a default setting,

275
00:20:59,689 --> 00:21:02,241
hopefully the computer
will read the difference.

276
00:21:02,896 --> 00:21:03,862
Hmm!

277
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:05,551
>> Access denied.

278
00:21:06,896 --> 00:21:08,551
>> We'll have to find
a back door,

279
00:21:08,586 --> 00:21:09,931
maybe if I use
my sub-routine,

280
00:21:09,965 --> 00:21:11,655
I can break the firewall.

281
00:21:11,689 --> 00:21:13,482
>> Access denied.

282
00:21:13,517 --> 00:21:15,655
>> I'm going to have to
fry the security drive

283
00:21:15,689 --> 00:21:17,275
and use my
master password

284
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,172
that will make
the firewall think I'm Nicole,

285
00:21:19,206 --> 00:21:21,034
this is our only hope guys.

286
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,000
>> Welcome Nicole.

287
00:21:27,034 --> 00:21:28,344
>> Okay I'm in.

288
00:21:29,862 --> 00:21:31,172
>> Oh.

289
00:21:31,827 --> 00:21:33,620
Okay I need any files
that were modified

290
00:21:33,655 --> 00:21:36,137
on or around the night
that Nicole was attacked.

291
00:21:41,517 --> 00:21:46,172
>> [sigh] Okay we have,
June log, July log and August.

292
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,413
Okay August, Ogden.

293
00:21:49,448 --> 00:21:52,413
>> Oh yah this one
this looks familiar, Ogden.

294
00:21:52,448 --> 00:21:53,448
>> Okay.

295
00:21:55,137 --> 00:21:56,724
Ogden correctional.

296
00:21:56,758 --> 00:21:57,724
>> That's the city jail,

297
00:21:57,758 --> 00:22:00,000
no wonder she's been
busy every Saturday.

298
00:22:00,034 --> 00:22:03,034
>> Isn't this
the same jail where your student

299
00:22:03,068 --> 00:22:05,931
what was his name
Dermot was in?

300
00:22:06,931 --> 00:22:07,931
Huh!

301
00:22:08,689 --> 00:22:10,482
She had an informant told her

302
00:22:10,517 --> 00:22:13,344
that there is some kind
of fight club in there.

303
00:22:14,896 --> 00:22:16,551
>> Okay I see.

304
00:22:18,655 --> 00:22:23,206
>> 2 AM expected start
time of underground fight

305
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:25,241
called fight club.

306
00:22:27,482 --> 00:22:31,655
Huh, her last entry is on
the day she disappeared.

307
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:36,862
I don't think anyone
is going to believe this.

308
00:22:36,896 --> 00:22:39,655
We're going to
need some proof.

309
00:22:39,689 --> 00:22:41,517
>> I will get proof.

310
00:22:41,965 --> 00:22:43,620
>> I suggest you give
a visit to your buddy

311
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:45,310
and see what's in there.

312
00:22:51,517 --> 00:22:54,241
>> Pass the ball,
come on man shoot it, shoot it,

313
00:22:54,275 --> 00:22:56,379
shoot it, come on, yeah.

327
00:24:37,586 --> 00:24:39,241
Is there something wrong?

328
00:24:41,931 --> 00:24:43,241
Talk to me.

329
00:24:50,862 --> 00:24:52,551

>> Tell me about it.

00:45:23,586 --> 00:45:26,413
For men with the courage
to go the extra mile.

542
00:45:27,344 --> 00:45:30,172
Now, called you here
for a reason.

543
00:45:30,896 --> 00:45:32,034
Here you go.

544
00:45:34,517 --> 00:45:36,344
I want you to fight for me.

545
00:45:37,896 --> 00:45:38,862
A man of your persuasion

546
00:45:38,896 --> 00:45:41,206
can really put
butts in the seats.

547
00:45:42,482 --> 00:45:44,068
>> Persuasion!

548
00:45:44,103 --> 00:45:45,896
>> Come on Morrison.

In the world of
professional sports

550

the blacks are dominant
everybody knows that.

551
00:45:50,655 --> 00:45:52,931
Now rich white folks
will pay good money

552
00:45:52,965 --> 00:45:55,172
to see a white boy
like yourself win.

553
00:45:55,206 --> 00:45:57,724
And win again
and keep winning.

554
00:45:57,758 --> 00:45:59,413
Now we can only watch
so much damn hockey

555

you know what
I'm saying. [laughing]

556
00:46:06,034 --> 00:46:10,034
I want you to prove yourself
as a great white warrior.

557
00:46:10,068 --> 00:46:11,724
I can give you
all the comforts you need

558
00:46:11,758 --> 00:46:14,931

560

>> I'll set you up
on so many bogus charges,

561
00:46:20,965 --> 00:46:24,172
I'll get your sentence
increased by twenty years.

562
00:46:24,206 --> 00:46:26,896
I'll basically make
your life a living hell.

563
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:31,137
>> Well I guess I'm going to
have to fight for you.

564
00:46:32,068 --> 00:46:33,379
>> Good!

565
00:46:33,413 --> 00:46:34,413
>> Cheers!

566
00:46:43,034 --> 00:46:47,137
Ahh come on man

>> Anything unusual
to report?

573
00:47:14,034 --> 00:47:15,172
>> No!

574
00:47:16,862 --> 00:47:18,517
Pike wins again.

are going to love this.

Any way uh hear me out.

585

I have finally
found Pike a partner

586
00:49:49,931 --> 00:49:52,034
so how about we do
the beach scenario.

587
00:49:52,068 --> 00:49:54,413
It's easy to secure
and it's way out of the way.

588
00:49:55,965 --> 00:49:58,068
This weekend!

589
00:49:58,103 --> 00:49:59,068

I just realized who you are.

596

I saw you fight
a few years back.

597
00:50:24,758 --> 00:50:27,724
I didn't recognize you
till I saw you again tonight.

598
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:30,931
Never thought I'd meet
Dirk Longstreet again.

599

keep it quiet between us.

Yeah, I'm calling about a
recent transfer a Jim Morrison.

604
00:51:21,068 --> 00:51:22,689
Now why would
you transfer this guy,

605
00:51:22,724 --> 00:51:24,724
he could
win you a lot of money.

606
00:51:24,758 --> 00:51:28,689
Besides I heard your circuit
is losing badly any way.

607
00:51:28,724 --> 00:51:30,724
No I said a Jim Morrison.

608
00:51:32,034 --> 00:51:34,034
Never heard of him.

609

That is impossible I've got
his file right in front of me,

01:02:58,206 --> 01:03:01,000
You guys have
already proven that.

720
01:03:01,034 --> 01:03:03,793
Now, we've got a challenge
from another penitentiary

721
01:03:03,827 --> 01:03:06,000
called Gilmore penitentiary.

722
01:03:06,034 --> 01:03:08,517
Those guys have been bragging
for the last couple months,

723
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:10,620
and they're talking
you guys down.

724
01:03:10,655 --> 01:03:12,586
I want you to
fight these guys.

725
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:14,241
I want you to
teach them a lesson.

726
01:03:14,275 --> 01:03:15,793
They punch you in the nose,
you crack their ribs.

727
01:03:15,827 --> 01:03:17,965
They crack your ribs.
you knock them out, cold.

728
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,275
Like a stuffed pig.

729
01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:21,862
You guys understand
what I'm saying?

730
01:03:21,896 --> 01:03:23,827
I hate losing.

731
01:03:23,862 --> 01:03:27,068
I hate losing
and I hate losers.

732
01:03:27,103 --> 01:03:28,620
At the end of the fights,

733
01:03:28,655 --> 01:03:32,655
I want you to be standing up,
not the opponent.

734
01:03:33,724 --> 01:03:34,827
You guys up for the challenge.

735
01:03:34,862 --> 01:03:35,827
>> Yeah!

736
01:03:35,862 --> 01:03:36,827
Are you up for the challenge"

737
01:03:36,862 --> 01:03:38,000
>> Yeah!

738
01:03:38,034 --> 01:03:40,000
>> Yeah! All right!

739
01:03:59,034 --> 01:04:03,068
[telephone ringing]

740
01:04:08,034 --> 01:04:10,206
>> Yeah!>> Max!

741
01:04:10,241 --> 01:04:11,620
You sound tired.

742
01:04:11,655 --> 01:04:12,965
>> I'll be all right.

743
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,068
Hey you know Biggs is setting
you and Pike up to fight

744
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:17,275
some champs from another
prison did you know that?

745
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:19,137
>> The war is on yeah.

746
01:04:20,068 --> 01:04:21,034
I know.

747
01:04:21,068 --> 01:04:24,103
>> Well don't trust Pike
not for a second.

748
01:04:24,137 --> 01:04:28,689
>> Yeah, do you know
when we fight?

749
01:04:28,724 --> 01:04:30,379
>> This weekend
but I don't know where.

750
01:04:30,413 --> 01:04:33,827
>> Okay, when you find out
just call Sykes.

751
01:04:33,862 --> 01:04:35,793
I'm sure he will know.

752
01:04:35,827 --> 01:04:39,586
>> I tried, Sykes is on
assignment in Texas.

753
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:43,206
>> Just figure out where they're
taking us and call the Feds.>> I'll be there.

754
01:04:43,241 --> 01:04:45,896
>> I better go before
someone get suspicious,

755
01:04:45,931 --> 01:04:47,034
I'll talk to you later.

756
01:04:47,068 --> 01:04:48,724
>> Okay, see ya.

757
01:04:50,034 --> 01:05:01,000
Matches, matches.

758
01:05:01,034 --> 01:05:04,000
[dramatic music]

759
01:05:08,206 --> 01:05:09,862
>> Look I told you

760
01:05:09,896 --> 01:05:11,551
half the money will be
transferred into your account

761
01:05:11,586 --> 01:05:13,241
by the end of the day.

762
01:05:14,068 --> 01:05:16,034
You know what needs to be done.

763
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:19,758
Good you call me
when the bitch is dead.

764
01:05:33,551 --> 01:05:35,137
>> God damn it!

765
01:05:35,172 --> 01:05:37,275
You let him know
we're on to him.

766
01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:39,655
What the hell
is wrong with you?

767
01:05:40,931 --> 01:05:42,413
I might have to cancel tonight.

768
01:05:42,448 --> 01:05:44,275
Too many people are on to us.

769
01:05:48,241 --> 01:05:50,344
>> This needs to
go down tonight.

770
01:05:50,379 --> 01:05:52,758
I'll take care of everything.

771
01:05:52,793 --> 01:05:54,275
>> You sure?

772
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:58,379
>> If he had put a few bullets
into the bitch's head
like I told him

773
01:05:58,413 --> 01:06:00,758
none of this
would be happening.

774
01:06:00,793 --> 01:06:02,758
>> Watch your mouth Pike.

775
01:06:02,793 --> 01:06:04,137
>> I took care
of the girl last night.

776
01:06:04,172 --> 01:06:05,931
>> Baxter!

777
01:06:05,965 --> 01:06:08,137
Take Pike back to his cell.

778
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:09,517
>> Let's go.

779
01:06:15,413 --> 01:06:17,241
>> One less witness.

780
01:06:21,689 --> 01:06:23,000

781
01:06:25,172 --> 01:06:26,862
[telephone ringing]

782
01:06:30,103 --> 01:06:33,068
>> Yeah Max,
I spoke to the sergeant.

783
01:06:33,103 --> 01:06:36,620
No, he can't move in
until he has the evidence.

784
01:06:37,655 --> 01:06:38,896
>> Now listen,

785
01:06:38,931 --> 01:06:41,172
can you at least keep a unit
on standby, ready to move in?

786
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:42,896
>> God, I'm trying to
get the coordinates

787
01:06:42,931 --> 01:06:44,689
I still don't know
where they are.

788
01:06:44,724 --> 01:06:47,103
I know on the beach
but which beach?

789
01:06:47,137 --> 01:06:51,172
The start up time
of the tournament is 2 AM.

790
01:06:51,206 --> 01:06:53,137
I'll try to find
the coordinates.

791
01:06:53,172 --> 01:06:54,620
>> Okay call me.

792
01:06:54,655 --> 01:06:57,068
>> Okay, okay I'll talk to you
in few minutes bye.

793
01:06:57,103 --> 01:06:58,965
>> Later.

794
01:07:01,965 --> 01:07:03,103
Aargh!

[waves crashing]

797
01:07:35,793 --> 01:07:37,275
>> Tell them we're starting.

798
01:07:49,758 --> 01:07:52,689
That's Morrison right there
in the black hat.

799
01:07:52,724 --> 01:07:54,551
>> I can't believe it.

800
01:07:57,896 --> 01:07:59,379
>> Ready to start.

801
01:08:00,275 --> 01:08:02,793
>> I'll be there. >> Okay!

802
01:08:03,965 --> 01:08:05,275
>> Wait here.

803
01:08:07,931 --> 01:08:10,827
>> Folks I know its cold tonight

804
01:08:10,862 --> 01:08:13,689
but we're all here
to see these convicts,

805
01:08:13,724 --> 01:08:15,862

I promise you a lot of blood,

810
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:26,931
I can even promise you
a death or two.

811
01:08:26,965 --> 01:08:30,000
Are you folks ready
to see some blood tonight?

813
01:08:32,206 --> 01:08:34,034

what time we're meeting him?

829
01:16:36,206 --> 01:16:37,172
I will take the chopper,

830
01:16:37,206 --> 01:16:39,758
yeah, the sun will be up
in a few minutes.

831
01:16:39,793 --> 01:16:41,137
>> Where are you flying from?

832
01:16:41,172 --> 01:16:43,758
>> From Van Nuys Airport.
See you there.

833
01:16:43,793 --> 01:16:45,827
>> You'll need more
than a chopper, Bill.

834
01:16:45,862 --> 01:16:47,586
>> Okay, you bring the cops.

835
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:49,517

I've got a wonderful surprise

I know something
you don't folks.

840

prize many times over.

842
01:17:12,758 --> 01:17:14,758
Haven't you.
[laughing]

843
01:17:15,758 --> 01:17:17,344
>> Before Dirk Longstreet
came here

844
01:17:17,379 --> 01:17:18,862
he used to fight
in an arena like this

845
01:17:18,896 --> 01:17:20,931
all over the eastern seaboard.

846
01:17:20,965 --> 01:17:23,310
So you guys expect
a great fight tonight.

>> Is that all you got?

851
01:17:56,172 --> 01:17:57,551
It must drive you crazy

852
01:17:57,586 --> 01:18:00,482
knowing that your bitch
felt my hot breath all over her.

853
01:18:06,034 --> 01:18:10,000
[drums beating]

854
01:18:33,344 --> 01:18:36,344
How doe's it feel Pike,
how does it feel?

855
01:18:39,448 --> 01:18:40,482
>> Come on Pike.

856
01:18:40,517 --> 01:18:43,620
>> Now you're not so tough
you son of a bitch.

857
01:18:43,655 --> 01:18:46,103
>> Get up Pike, get up.

858
01:18:46,137 --> 01:18:47,896
>> You better be running now.

859
01:18:47,931 --> 01:18:49,103
Get back here, Pike.

860
01:18:49,137 --> 01:18:50,344
>> No, no, don't.

861
01:18:50,379 --> 01:18:52,586
>> Let's get the hell
out of here.>> Get back here.

862
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:54,344
They're running away.

863
01:18:54,379 --> 01:18:56,344
>> What the hell is going on?

864
01:18:56,379 --> 01:18:57,551
>> Hey get down.

865
01:18:59,344 --> 01:19:00,448
Freeze!

866
01:19:00,482 --> 01:19:02,655
>> Stop, stop right now
or I'll shoot.

[guns firing]

868
01:19:14,275 --> 01:19:17,482

[gun firing]

870
01:19:31,862 --> 01:19:34,344
>> Go after them
get the damn bastards.

871
01:19:35,275 --> 01:19:37,103
Just shoot them all.

872

[guns firing]

873
01:19:45,448 --> 01:19:48,448
I hear sirens
lets get out of here.

874
01:19:48,482 --> 01:19:50,310
Come on, let's go this way.

875

[sirens wailing]

876
01:19:53,862 --> 01:19:56,000
>> if we look at the geography
of this entire region,

877
01:19:56,034 --> 01:19:59,689
there is only
one area accessible for cars,

878
01:19:59,724 --> 01:20:02,379
that's where they'll be!

879
01:20:02,413 --> 01:20:04,103
>> We'll be there
in 15 minuets.

880
01:20:04,137 --> 01:20:05,310
>> Let's go.

881
01:20:17,034 --> 01:20:20,689
>> Tower this is 59577,
request clearance.

882
01:20:36,068 --> 01:20:45,172
We should have
visual any time now.

883
01:20:45,206 --> 01:20:47,241
>> There, there
that's the area,

884
01:20:47,275 --> 01:20:48,965
behind the rocks.

885
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:52,000
The other side,
let's go to the other side.

886
01:20:56,931 --> 01:20:58,482
There I see them.

887
01:20:58,517 --> 01:21:03,896
>> Get back.

888
01:21:03,896 --> 01:21:08,586
>> Get back.

889
01:21:23,896 --> 01:21:25,793
>> Dirk Longstreet
this is the Police.

890
01:21:25,827 --> 01:21:28,655
Officers on the ground have been
notified as to your position

891
01:21:28,689 --> 01:21:30,517
and are on route.

892
01:22:00,206 --> 01:22:03,724
>> That's enough Dirk,
everything is under control.

893
01:22:15,379 --> 01:22:30,000
>> You killed Nicole
you son of a bitch.
