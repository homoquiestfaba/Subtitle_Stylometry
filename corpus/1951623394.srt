1
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,831
Oh!

2
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,837
Aah!

3
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,998
Wildfire, you either walk
into that other corral,

4
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,356
or I'm gonna shoot ya
and drag your carcass in there.

5
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,830
Come on, Wildfire.
Come on, boy.

6
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,912
Let's go meet Susie now.
You'll like her.

7
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,831
You two
gotta get together.

8
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,159
Gotcha!
Whoa, whoa!

9
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,789
Whoa, boy, whoa!
Whoa!

10
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,711
Damn it.

11
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,836
You and Susie are gonna make
some little birds, or I'm gonna
take some barbecue sauce to ya!

12
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,670
Earl Basset, right?

13
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,718
<i>I told you</i>
<i>that's the other one.</i>

14
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,918
Señor Basset.

15
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,193
<i>This is beautiful country,</i>
<i>but very isolated.</i>

16
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,556
<i>I had great difficulty</i>
<i>finding you,</i>
<i>but I'm glad I did.</i>

17
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,519
<i>You see, we have had to</i>
<i>close down one of Mexico's</i>
<i>biggest oil fields.</i>

18
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,319
<i>Several workers</i>
<i>have been killed.</i>

19
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,472
Ah, we have
now determined that...

20
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,710
the men were killed by...

21
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,509
certain large
underground animals.

22
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,831
Graboids.

23
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,959
Ah! I told you that's
what they named 'em.
Excuse me.

24
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,079
You mean...
there's more of them?

25
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,869
Yes. The company is facing
very expensive delays.

26
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,714
<i>But more importantly,</i>
<i>there are many isolated people</i>
<i>who live in the region.</i>

27
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,631
Many lives are in danger.

28
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,872
<i>We need someone, an expert,</i>
<i>to eliminate these creatures.</i>

29
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,797
- You want somebody
to go graboid hunting?
<i>- Sí.</i>

30
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,757
Ah, señor,
please, please!

31
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,400
<i>We've already spoken</i>
<i>to your partner, Señor McKee.</i>

32
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,311
H-He is unwilling
to help us.

33
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,551
Sure, Val married a good woman.
Why would he want to die?

34
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,394
Of course,
we are willing to pay.
They're willing to pay!

35
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,631
'Kay.

36
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,712
$50,000.

37
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,439
Go... away.

38
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,071
No, no, no. He wants to pay you
$50,000 for each graboid.

39
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,037
Look.

40
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,953
No way. Not for
any amount of money.

41
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,713
But for you, getting those worms
would be a piece of cake.

42
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,473
Who are you?
And why are you so dumb?

43
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,596
Oh, Grady. Grady.

44
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,593
<i>Grady Hoover. It's an honor</i>
<i>to meet you, Mr. Basset, sir.</i>
<i>I'm probably your biggest fan.</i>

45
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,514
That Reebok commercial
with you guys runnin' through
the desert... so very cool.

46
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,433
- You like that, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

47
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,030
Listen, could I come in?
I mean, just for a second.

48
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,031
Great.

49
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,191
Thanks.

50
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,670
<i>The</i> Earl Basset.
Ohh!

51
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,957
Yep. I've read
every one of these.

52
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,794
I got two copies of this one.
I keep one wrapped in plastic.

53
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,634
<i>Oh, my God, you got</i>
<i>your own one of these!</i>

54
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,032
Oh, I bet you made a fortune
off this. Quarter, quarter,
quarter, quarter.

55
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,918
Well, somebody did.
It sure wasn't me.

56
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,393
Well, you musta got
a percentage.

57
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,311
I shoulda got
a lawyer.

58
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,188
Wow. That sucks.

59
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,469
Did he really say
$50,000?

60
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,199
Stack of Bibles.

61
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,397
Forget it.

62
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,440
You boys don't know
how mean these things are.

63
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,876
<i>Well, okay...</i>
<i>okay, but...</i>
That was my big chance.

64
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,875
<i>Yeah, but M-Mr. Basset...</i>
You only get one of those
in life, and I blew it...

65
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,077
on goddam Big Bird
and his scrawny girlfriend!

66
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,351
Yeah, but <i>50,000.</i>

67
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,271
That's what
she's doin' there.

68
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,191
Who?

69
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,717
Ooh.
"Miss October, 1974"?

70
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:59,158
<i>Yeah, she's there to remind me</i>
<i>not to keep chasin' after things</i>
<i>I'm never gonna get.</i>

71
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,276
But why wouldn't
you get this?

72
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,114
Earl... Mr. Basset,
you're the expert. You guys
kicked ass with those things.

73
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,998
And this time, you'll be
a step ahead of them.

74
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,356
The Mexican army is willin'
to give you whatever you want.

75
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,115
Dynamite.
Shh, whoo, wa-bam! 50 Gs!

76
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,397
Maybe this is your
big second chance.

77
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,278
Señor Ortega,
you've got a deal.

78
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,874
Bravo, bravo!
And I'm
goin' with him.

79
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,350
<i>¡Ah, muy bien, muy bien!</i>
Um, if you'll excuse me?

80
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,670
What? Why do you think
I drove all this way?

81
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,593
When he said he was looking
for <i>the</i> Earl Basset,

82
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,478
I knew Opportunity
was knockin', and I was home.

83
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,437
I don't even know you.

84
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,116
I drive a taxi;
I live in a crappy apartment;
I watch too much TV; et cetera.

85
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,716
Look, you're going to need
a partner. How many people
would want to do this?

86
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,510
<i>I'll do anything you want:</i>
<i>Carry luggage, make coffee,</i>

87
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,431
light fuses.

88
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,949
Maybe you will
come in handy.

89
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,828
Ha!
When they're eating you, it'll
give me a chance to get away.

90
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,911
Uh-oh.

91
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,117
Who gets the last soda?
One, two...

92
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,158
What?
Scissors,
rock, paper.

93
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,800
One, two, three!
What's this?

94
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,111
Scissors cuts paper.
I win.

95
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,151
Buenos días, señores.

96
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,233
<i>¿Ustedes dos son los americanos</i>
<i>cazadores de monstruos?</i>
Um...

97
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,915
Um... <i>Quién es...</i> uh...

98
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,594
No, no, no, no.
<i>"¿Dónde está..."</i>
<i>Señor Ortega?</i>

99
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,070
<i>¿Ortega? Oh, Ortega,</i>
<i>venga acá. Están aquí.</i>

100
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,391
Welcome.
Welcome, gentlemen.
You made good time.

101
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,948
The sooner we get here,
the sooner we can leave.

102
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,316
- This is Pedro, the company's
chief engineer.
<i>- Mucho gusto.</i>

103
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,994
Uh, <i>buenos días.</i>
<i>Ysu nuevo compañero,</i>
<i>el Sr. Hoover.</i>

104
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,198
<i>Mucho gusto.</i>
<i>Buena suerte y que los monstruos</i>
<i>no los coman a ustedes.</i>

105
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,238
Pedro.

106
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,199
Um, I have all your
equipment over here.

107
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,999
Oh, by the way,
I have some good news.

108
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,232
We offer you double the price
if you are able to capture
one of the animals alive.

109
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,869
Double?
Alive? Have you ever seen
one of these things?

110
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,795
It is only a suggestion...
if it was possible
to capture one of them.

111
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,156
No, you never know.
Earl, you never know.
Yes, I do.

112
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,549
Never should have
come down here.

113
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,518
The army has sent
everything you requested.

114
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,909
You have asked for some...

115
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,831
Unusual things.

116
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,795
Earl, please
check this out.

117
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,678
Look, this isn't
some kind of party.

118
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,591
I know that.

119
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,956
I just think we should show
a little enthusiasm here.

120
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,198
Let me introduce you
to Kate Riley.
Hi.

121
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,078
<i>She's the geologist</i>
<i>for the oil company.</i>
<i>And these are the men...</i>

122
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,472
I know, I know.
The monster hunters. I saw you
on <i>Good Morning, America...</i>

123
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,869
or, uh, one of those.

124
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,873
<i>Yeah, this is, uh,</i>
the <i>Earl Basset,</i>
<i>the one and only.</i>

125
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,430
Uh, that's right.
Nice to meet ya.

126
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,910
- Really nice to meet you.
<i>- I'm Grady Hoover,</i>
<i>the new guy.</i>

127
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,831
<i>Nice... hat.</i>
Thanks.

128
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,195
I hope to hear
good news soon.

129
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,398
<i>Miss Riley will stay in contact</i>
<i>with me. Let us know</i>
<i>anything else you need.</i>

130
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,311
And, uh...

131
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,073
Well, best of luck
to you, huh?

132
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,037
<i>Vaya con Dios.</i>

133
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,511
<i>So this is the place.</i>
<i>I'll show you around.</i>
<i>You thirsty or anything?</i>

134
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,036
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, I am.

135
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,918
<i>Anyway, we've been</i>
<i>pretty nervous down here.</i>

136
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,798
<i>Glad you guys were willin'</i>
<i>to come all this way.</i>

137
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,599
<i>It sure is in the middle</i>
<i>of nowhere.</i>

138
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,434
Well, of course.
Stuff like this only happens
in the middle of nowhere.

139
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,910
- Hey, Julio.
- Hey, Kate.

140
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,798
So?
It's all done.
They're all working.

141
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,396
Yes, yes! Guys, this is Julio.
He's been setting up
the seismographs. Earl, Grady.

142
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,278
Yes, I've seen you
in the magazines.

143
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,158
Actually, I'm not
the original guy.

144
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,314
You know, you musta made a lot
of money, huh? The royalties
on that video game alone! Ooh.

145
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,154
<i>Julio, we should be able to get</i>
<i>an accurate count now, right?</i>

146
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,198
<i>Yes, yes. I have a friend</i>
<i>who invested in that company.</i>

147
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,831
Hey.

148
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,992
Hi. Come on in.

149
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,551
So, uh, we were gonna
look over some maps?

150
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,837
Right. Um, coffee?

151
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,229
Yeah, black.

152
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,278
How were those
burritos, anyway?

153
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,351
Um, good. Good.

154
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,000
Yeah, sorry about that.

155
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,356
Pretty bad, I know.
But with Cook gone,
that's best we've got.

156
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,191
So, um... how many of you
are still workin' out here?

157
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,034
Only the three of us.
They had to shut the whole
operation down.

158
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,951
Six people got killed...

159
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,871
people I knew.

160
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,750
Hmm. Well, uh,
how come you stayed on?
Well...

161
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,469
You're not scared?
Shit, yeah, I'm scared.

162
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,790
But...
I'm also fascinated.

163
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,711
It's, uh...

164
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,712
With me, "fascinated"
usually wins.

165
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,155
Maps.

166
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,435
I'll get these cores out
of the way. Come on, baby.

167
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,310
So, uh,
have the graboids come
near the refinery yet?

168
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,517
No, they've left us alone.
They stay about 20 miles north.

169
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,909
That's where the workers
were killed.

170
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,309
Who named them
graboids, anyway?

171
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,791
A... friend of ours,
Walter Chang.

172
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,713
He named them,
then they ate him.

173
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,554
<i>Hey, guys,</i>
<i>look what I made.</i>

174
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,310
Just, you know,
drag it behind the truck.

175
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,553
Make, you know,
make more noise.

176
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,519
You see, uh,
graboids hunt by sound.

177
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,398
I'll probably just go hook that
to the back of the truck.

178
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,840
"Moonstros."
<i>Ah, sí.</i>

179
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,229
<i>Mr. Hoover, come here please.</i>

180
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,470
<i>I have the monitor working.</i>

181
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,391
Okay.

182
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,554
We've set up radio seismographs
all over, so the monitor will
show you where the graboids are.

183
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,393
Cool.

184
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,156
You know, this is none of my
business, I guess, but you guys
are going out there alone?

185
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,995
You don't want to take with you
the whole army of Mexico?
<i>Let me explain, Julio.</i>

186
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,117
Graboids, they got no eyes.
They hunt by sound.

187
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,919
<i>You make a noise;</i>
<i>They're gonna come after you.</i>

188
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,356
If we get a bunch of people
runnin' around...

189
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,399
Graboids gonna spread out
all over the place. No,
we want 'em all to come to us.

190
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,236
So you guys are what?
You guys are the bait?

191
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,511
That's the plan.

192
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,795
Okay, so, uh...

193
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,396
<i>That's us.</i>
<i>That's our truck.</i>

194
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,791
<i>Seems like everything's</i>
<i>workin' okay.</i>

195
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,919
Well, sure it is, Earl.
This is a high-tech,
professional operation here.

196
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,232
Hey, we got a good plan goin'.
Fifty thousand apiece, baby.

197
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,472
Ho! You know, me,
I'm gonna get mine all at once,

198
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,391
just stacked!

199
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,439
Well, if I make any money
this time, I'll invest it...
conservatively.

200
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,991
Hey, you shaved.

201
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,074
What?
No, I just... I just noticed
you... you know, shaved.

202
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,157
So what?
A man can shave, can't he?

203
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,477
No, you're right.
She's a babe.

204
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,429
Well,

205
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,159
here's where they're
supposed to be.

206
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,913
Man, look at that
country, huh?

207
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,595
Yeah. Not a lot of rocks
and boulders out there.

208
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,990
Not much to climb on if we
don't want to get slurped.

209
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,760
There's mountains around.
You said they can't
get through mountains.

210
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,354
I said they can't
go through rock.

211
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,271
<i>These hills are alluvial.</i>

212
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,352
Oh, "alluvial."

213
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,399
Wait a minute, that's the little
dingleberry in the back
of your throat, right?

214
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,278
You want to hunt graboids;
you better know geology.

215
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,275
<i>Here, you drive. I'm keepin'</i>
<i>my eye on this... seismo-jigger.</i>

216
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,191
Oh, good call.

217
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,438
No offence, Earl, but you're
nervous as a chihuahua.

218
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,636
I'm not nervous.
I'm alert.

219
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,551
Whatever.

220
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,793
<i>Those worms have to be deaf</i>
<i>if they don't hear us.</i>

221
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,270
Hey, take it easy, huh?

222
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,991
<i>Jesus, Grady.</i>
<i>We got one!</i>

223
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,277
- It's spotted us!
It's comin' right toward us!
- Well, that's the idea.

224
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,636
Doesn't mean I have to like it.
Now stop. Stop already!

225
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,475
Okay, time
for the secret weapon.

226
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,548
<i>Careful with that detonator.</i>
<i>Set it like I showed you.</i>

227
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,918
- How dumb do you think I am?
- Catch me later on that one.

228
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,430
- He's comin' in.
I think he's followin' it.

229
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,318
Of course he is.

230
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,152
I can't see it, Earl.
Earl, I can't see it!

231
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,198
<i>Left. Left.</i>
<i>Left!</i>

232
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,431
- Okay, okay.
<i>- Wait. Wait, there.</i>

233
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,711
He did it. He took it.
O-Okay. Hit it! Get him!

234
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,837
Oh, shit.
Earl, what are you doin'?
Hit it, hit it!

235
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,911
Hit it!
Hit it, Earl!

236
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,554
<i>Whoo-hoo-hoo!</i>
<i>50 Gs, baby, 50 Gs!</i>

237
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,189
Oh, shit!

238
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,272
Told ya.

239
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,237
I forgot.

240
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,876
Yeah!
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

241
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,675
Man, this stuff
really stinks.

242
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,116
Yeah, don't forget
to get that antenna too.

243
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,113
<i>Uno de los mejores éxitos</i>
<i>de Travis Tritt.</i>

244
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,354
Vamos a continuar con una media hora
de música sin interrupción.

245
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,078
You left the radio
on the ground?

246
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,151
Sorry, I forgot.

247
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,400
Is that a coyote?

248
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,914
Yep.

249
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,833
Man, he better keep quiet.

250
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,878
Yep.

251
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,517
He took it.
Hey, it's my turn.

252
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,398
Oh, c-come on, Earl.
Let me get one more.

253
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,311
Shit.

254
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,393
Rock breaks scissors.
I win.

255
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,233
It does?

256
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,555
I told you one stick
would be enough.

257
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,915
<i>You're right.</i>

258
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,754
That makes $300,000.

259
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,671
Apiece.

260
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,116
I'm feelin'
light-headed, Earl.

261
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,919
And whatcha gonna do
with all your money?

262
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,798
Invest it.
Well, yeah, of course,
invest it, but...

263
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,519
Even at five percent,
I'll be doin' pretty good.

264
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,594
Five percent?
You're talkin', um, mutual funds
or C.D. S or somethin', huh?

265
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,468
That's right.
That's small, Earl.
You're thinkin' small.

266
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,632
See, I'm thinkin'
<i>big,</i> okay?

267
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,995
I'm thinkin' <i>theme park.</i>

268
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,631
Now, now.
"Grady Hoover's World
of Natural Wonders."

269
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,918
Whoa! Or, you know,
maybe somethin' simple,

270
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,754
like "Monster World,"
or "Monsterland"...

271
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,671
or "Worm World."

272
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,196
How 'bout "Looney World"?
Seems to fit.
Get off the ground!

273
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,111
It's vision, Earl.

274
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,875
Vision is what separates
the average...

275
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,388
I know that song.

276
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,516
<i>Jesus! Get off the ground,</i>
<i>Grady! Get off the ground!</i>

277
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,832
Whoa!

278
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,833
Jesus, man,
those things are huge!

279
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,309
Shh! Be quiet!
Did you see that mouth?

280
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,555
Oh, no.

281
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,631
<i>It snagged the chain.</i>

282
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,232
Can it do that?

283
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,916
It can't be that strong.

284
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,349
Son of a bitch!

285
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,800
- Hit the brakes!
- I am! I did!

286
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,757
It doesn't work!

287
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,071
Earl!
What do I do?

288
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,754
<i>- I don't know.</i>
<i>Do anything!</i>
- Ooh!

289
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,670
- Cliff!
- Oh, no.

290
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,953
He stopped. He stopped.

291
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,759
Oh, shit.

292
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,031
Oh, come on.

293
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,356
Rock!

294
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,035
<i>Rock!</i>
He's going under it!

295
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,759
Turn! Turn the wheel!

296
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,638
- Turn!
- I'm trying; I'm trying!

297
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,359
Oh, God, oh, God!

298
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,911
<i>Yee-ha!</i>

299
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,154
All right.

300
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,071
You all right?

301
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,958
Wow, chain broke
right off.

302
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,871
Jesus, we're lucky.

303
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,518
Well, truck seems
to be all right.

304
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,275
Earl, that's gonna be the first
ride in my theme park.

305
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,113
Doesn't anything
ever get you down?

306
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,998
Well, I'm blessed
with a sunny disposition.

307
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,548
Most people
seem to like it.

308
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,990
Oh, yeah? What does this
do for your disposition?

309
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,794
I think we're gonna
need some help.

310
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,156
Help? Who'd be crazy enough
to help us with this mess?

311
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:37,115
<i>The big guns pounded enemy</i>
<i>positions for 72 straight hours.</i>

312
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,749
<i>It was the deadliest</i>
<i>bombardment of the siege.</i>

313
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,637
Yeah?

314
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,190
Hey, Burt, it's Earl.
How ya doin'?

315
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,111
Listen, um,

316
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,998
If this sounds kinda funny, it's
'cause I'm on a radio phone.

317
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,913
It's the only way we
can call out of this place.

318
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,438
Earl? Oh... Earl.
Haven't seen you in a while.

319
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,869
<i>Well, I haven't seen you.</i>
<i>Guess you've been layin'</i>
<i>kinda low, huh?</i>

320
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,349
Layin' low?
No. Negative.

321
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,671
I've been real busy...
lots of projects.

322
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,877
So, uh, how
you and Heather doing?

323
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,636
Well, she, uh...
She's still visiting her sister.

324
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,950
Yeah?

325
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,759
You know, she actually...

326
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,116
blames our problems on the
collapse of the Soviet Union?

327
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,919
Well, you did take that
kinda hard, Burt.

328
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,632
Said I was hard to live with.
Said I couldn't handle life
without the threat of war.

329
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,555
What kind of thing
is that to say to a man?
Well, I don't know, Burt...

330
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,996
Anyway, it takes more
than that to get me down.

331
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,878
I been running around so much,
it's lucky you caught me home.

332
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,715
Well, in that case, I don't know
if you'd be interested in this.

333
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,554
I'm down in Mexico,
see, and I find myself
in a sort of situation.

334
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,995
What kind of situation?

335
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,228
A graboid
kind of situation.

336
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,278
Hey, you keepin'
an eye on that monitor?

337
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,477
Uh, yeah, I'm watchin' it.
They're just stayin' up north.

338
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,313
- Oh, my God!
What?

339
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,994
Sorry. Come here.
Come here. Look at this.

340
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,030
I've been staring
at this fossil for over a month,
and I just realized what it is.

341
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,874
Hey, Earl, that looks like one
of those spikes on their sides.

342
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,791
<i>Okay, it resembles one.</i>

343
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,953
<i>I really think it is</i>
<i>a fossil fragment of a graboid.</i>

344
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,349
<i>It's gonna take</i>
<i>months to prove...</i>

345
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,317
No, this is important,
isn't it?

346
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,960
Science has never
determined their origin.

347
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,474
I read that in <i>People.</i>

348
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:09,839
And that's true. But that's not
the only thing. You guys,
this is Precambrian rock.

349
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,637
Precambrian.

350
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,157
Precambrian. That means
that this is the oldest
life form on the planet.

351
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,038
<i>I mean other than one-celled</i>
<i>things. But look at that.</i>

352
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,033
- Wait a minute.
Older than dinosaurs?
<i>- Way.</i>

353
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,918
So they're from earth,
right? Damn.
<i>Yeah.</i>

354
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,514
I always thought
they were from outer space.

355
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,558
<i>Doesn't look like it.</i>

356
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,677
<i>¡Mira, mira!</i>
<i>¡El monstruo más grande...</i>
<i>viene acá!</i>

357
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,876
Look! Look at
the seismograph! Look!

358
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,599
<i>¡El monstruo viene!</i>
<i>¡Es grande!</i>

359
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,550
It ain't no graboid.

360
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,790
It's somethin'
more dangerous.

361
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,151
Monster H.Q., I presume.

362
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,708
Hey, Burt,
good to see you.
Earl, good to see you.

363
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,679
Uh, this is Kate,
uh, Pedro,
Hey, what's up?

364
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,036
Julio, and, uh...
The pleasure is mine.

365
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,157
Grady, Grady Hoover.
Yeah, I read all about you,
Mr... Mr. Gummer.

366
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,073
- Yeah, it's a real...
real honor.
- Yes.

367
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:35,153
Man, you think you got
a big enough truck here?
He the new guy?

368
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,152
<i>So, did you get me one</i>
<i>of those seismo-monitors?</i>

369
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,312
<i>Hey, no problem.</i>
What you got in this thing?

370
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,550
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

371
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,279
Don't touch.
Don't touch. Easy.

372
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,669
Mexican army gave me
this truck...

373
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,113
And a few little items
on my wish list.

374
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,632
Ho!

375
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,192
It's, uh, a bit much,
don't you think?

376
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,271
Maybe I'm wrong.

377
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,191
Hope I'm right.

378
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,872
Makes my home-made stuff
look like cherry bombs.

379
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:31,273
Thermite, C-4, TNT,
high-explosive... H.E.

380
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,920
Is there such thing
as "low-explosive"?

381
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,030
Well, y-yes,
son, there is.

382
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:43,830
I mean, the <i>federales</i> offer
you anything you want, and you
guys take <i>one</i> case of dynamite?

383
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,309
What the hell
is this thing for?

384
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,393
That, uh, might end up
in my collection.

385
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,313
Hey, got some, uh, new equipment
for you, gentlemen.

386
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,118
Your backup weapons.
Can you handle a firearm?

387
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,873
I'll check him out.

388
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,791
Shotguns?

389
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,678
We're not huntin'
rabbits down here, Burt.

390
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,957
Not shotguns.
Double rifles. Elephant guns.

391
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,989
Wesley-Richards 480,
375 H&H Mag.

392
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,629
Knockdown power
up the yin-yang.
Treat them well.

393
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,872
But hold 'em good 'n tight
to your shoulder, or they'll
break your collarbone.

394
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,191
So where's, uh, Mrs. Gummer?
She didn't want to come?

395
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,193
<i>Uh, why don't you get this,</i>
<i>uh, stuff in our truck?</i>

396
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,151
Sure, no problem.

397
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,832
Look, man, I... really want
to thank you for comin' down.

398
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,231
We're in pretty deep here.

399
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,311
Oh, forget it, Earl.

400
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:53,032
To tell you the truth, if I
didn't get out of that house,
I was gonna go crazy.

401
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,951
Heather's not comin' back.

402
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,076
No?

403
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,675
She called me and told me
to send her the H.K. -91.

404
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,796
Whew. Ouch.

405
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,757
Yep.

406
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,791
So.

407
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,557
Anyway, it'll be good to get
into somethin' constructive.

408
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,194
Oh, my.
What is this?

409
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,397
Grizzly single-shot
50-calibre B.M. G...

410
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,199
based on a World War I
antitank cartridge.

411
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,558
- Antitank?
- Had the bullets custom cast
from solid bronze.

412
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,633
Man, Burt, you put a whole new
shine on the word "overkill."

413
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,315
When you need it
and don't have it,
you sing a different tune.

414
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,390
Well, this is it, Burt.
Okay.

415
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,517
I'll patrol east.
You take the west.

416
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,638
You know, those are
terrible for you.

417
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,474
<i>You need complex carbohydrates.</i>
<i>Lower those L.D.L.s.</i>

418
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,199
I gave up smoking, Burt.
What more do you want?

419
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,512
- Have an M.R.E.
- A what?

420
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,431
Meals Ready to Eat.

421
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,351
Freeze-dried, foil sealed.

422
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,069
It's got to be foil. Plastic
is <i>not</i> an oxygen barrier.

423
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,152
Includes entrée,
cracker pack, cheese spread,

424
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,118
mixed fruit, beverage powder,
spoon, coffee,

425
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,591
cream substitute, candy, salt,
matches, toilet tissue.

426
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,240
Shelf life of ten years.

427
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,517
Here, take a few.

428
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,398
Buy 'em all the time.
Saves trips to the supermarket.

429
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,436
<i>Oh, no, Burt.</i>

430
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,909
We don't want to use up
all your food.
<i>No problem.</i>

431
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,355
Brought 120 pounds of it.

432
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,317
Good luck, <i>compadres.</i>

433
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:22,592
<i>Oh, man, this stuff</i>
<i>tastes like toilet paper.</i>

434
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,593
<i>Earl, that</i> is
<i>the toilet paper.</i>

435
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,751
14 May.

436
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,673
1500 hours.

437
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:51,151
I have a confirmed
graboid reading.

438
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,391
I'm now employing the technique
pioneered by Earl Basset...

439
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,155
to make my first kill.

440
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,391
Subject has taken
the bait.

441
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,311
Preparing to fire.

442
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,277
Yes!

443
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,515
Memo:

444
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,956
Four pounds of C-4
may be a little...

445
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,831
excessive.

446
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,555
<i>Yo, Grady and Earl.</i>
<i>I got one. Over.</i>

447
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,511
Yeah, we know, Burt.
We heard it clear over here.

448
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,354
Damnedest thing. It had a big
chain hangin' out of its mouth.

449
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,035
Damn it. Burt, you skunk,
that one was ours.

450
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:04,352
<i>Oh, yeah, son? I didn't see</i>
<i>your name on it. Over and out.</i>

451
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,829
Why did we
invite him, anyway?

452
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,831
Hey, pay attention.

453
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,435
Whoa.
We got one.

454
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,511
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

455
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,034
It's movin' away from us.

456
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:21,432
It must be
somethin' else.

457
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,351
Like what,
a giant prairie dog?

458
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,910
Well, shit, I don't know, Earl.
It's movin' away from us.

459
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,039
Should we follow it?

460
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,638
<i>What the hell is</i>
<i>the matter with him?</i>

461
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,837
We're makin'
plenty of noise.

462
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,959
I don't like it, Grady.
They're gettin' smarter.
That's what they do.

463
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,838
They got some kinda
plan goin' here.

464
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:59,357
I tell ya, these boys
are up to somethin' new.

465
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,877
They're diggin'
a trap for us, or...

466
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,791
playin' possum,

467
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,189
Or somethin'.

468
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,748
Holy Mother!

469
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,593
Oh, man, oh, man!

470
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,755
Shit! Shit, how
could I do that?

471
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,671
I gotta get
to Burt's gun!

472
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,157
Whoa.

473
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,959
- Where is he?
Should be all over us.
- I don't know.

474
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,634
- What is that?
Can they do that?
- Shh.

475
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,636
That's a new one on me.

476
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,318
Jesus, Grady, what are you
doin'? Get off the ground!

477
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,837
I know, I know.
I got an idea. Trust me.

478
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,789
Damn it, Grady,
come on back.

479
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,391
He's still there.

480
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:31,039
What the hell's
it doing?

481
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,429
I have no idea.

482
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,829
Something's wrong
with him.

483
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,751
Must be sick.

484
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,638
Probably ate somebody
that didn't agree with it.

485
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,391
Jesus, Grady!

486
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,471
It's okay, Earl.

487
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:47,314
He's not goin' anywhere.

488
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,231
Hey!

489
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:54,239
We just caught ourselves
a live one.

490
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,312
That's $100,000, Earl.

491
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,231
Oh, yes!

492
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,118
Oh, yeah?
What're you gonna do,
carry him back?

493
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,031
We just wrecked
the truck.

494
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,389
Oh, yeah.

495
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,989
Hello, this is Earl
to anybody.

496
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,469
<i>Anybody there?</i>

497
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,916
Hey, Earl, it's Kate.
How're you guys doin'?
Well, uh...

498
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,714
we kinda wrecked our truck
a little bit.
What?

499
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,631
A-Are you okay?

500
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,518
We're fine. We're gonna need
somebody to come fetch us.

501
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:36,276
Let me talk to her.
Would you tell Pedro to bring
that big truck of his out here?

502
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:39,477
It's got a crane on it,
doesn't it?
Yeah.

503
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,471
<i>It's going to</i>
<i>take him hours.</i>

504
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,915
Tell him to bring it
because...

505
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,438
- We're gonna winch that slinky
off to Monster World.
- Get off the damn ground!

506
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,636
I'm off; I'm off.

507
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,953
Jesus!

508
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,838
Damn it, he got
himself another one.

509
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,480
The man never sleeps.

510
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:21,598
<i>Guys, Burt here, doin'</i>
<i>a little night fishing.</i>

511
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:26,390
<i>Got three of 'em</i>
<i>on a cluster charge. I'd say</i>
<i>we're about even now. Over.</i>

512
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,870
Come on, Burt.
This isn't a competition.
Who's competing?

513
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,758
I'm just saying the score's
tied, that's all. Over.

514
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:36,355
Well, <i>son,</i> no it isn't,
'cause we just caught
ourselves a live one.

515
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:40,592
A live one? How in the...
That's a trade secret.
Happy huntin', Burt.

516
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,838
I'll bet that burned
his skinny ass.

517
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:52,036
God Almighty!

518
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,349
Somethin's wrong
with our worm, Earl.

519
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,113
Well, what do you want
me to do about it?

520
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,630
Maybe somethin's tryin'
to eat it out there...
coyotes or somethin'.

521
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,790
They'll have plenty to eat.

522
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,111
Come on, Earl. We have got
to protect our investment.
We can't just sit here.

523
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,830
Jesus, listen to it!

524
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:28,708
Poor thing. I mean,
don't you just feel
a little sorry for him?

525
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,076
No.

526
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,991
That's cold, Earl.

527
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,317
Where's that Pedro
and that damn truck?

528
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,752
Something ate it!

529
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,308
In two minutes?

530
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,710
<i> Well, somethin'</i>
<i>happened to it, 'cause</i>
<i>there is nothin' left inside.</i>

531
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:41,759
Something came out of it.
What do you mean,
something came out of it?

532
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:45,116
It did that thing that things do
when they change, you know...

533
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,031
there's a word
for it, uh...

534
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:51,113
It turned into something else
like a caterpillar does.

535
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,829
Only I bet that
whatever came out wasn't
no sweet little butterfly.

536
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,438
Damn worms never
cut you any slack.

537
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,799
<i>I said you all ought to</i>
<i>head out to Rioverde.</i>

538
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,589
Clear out 'til we know
what's going on. Over.

539
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,478
Kate, did you
get any of that? Over.

540
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,950
Shit! Now, what?

541
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:29,112
The radio's out.
How could that be?
I was just talking to her.

542
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,313
Man! You know
what that is, don't you?

543
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,994
Yeah. Another one's
doing it.

544
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,517
There! There's Pedro!

545
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,716
'Bout damn time.

546
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,914
- He stopped.
- He stopped?

547
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,639
Maybe he's taking a leak?

548
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,428
That's a long leak.

549
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,193
Hey, Pedro! Pedro!

550
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,796
Well,

551
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,838
maybe we should go over
and see what's wrong.

552
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,913
Go over? You mean, walk a mile
across open country?

553
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,159
I'm not going six feet
from that seismo.

554
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,596
<i>Come on. There's no graboids</i>
<i>anywhere near us right now.</i>

555
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,912
Now, I say we go
while the going's good.

556
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,998
You know, you could
carry some of this stuff.

557
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,071
I got what I want.

558
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,750
Well, I can't say
this looks good.

559
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,797
Pedro?

560
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,877
Hey, Pedro!

561
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:23,069
Man!

562
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,515
This brings
back memories.

563
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:42,232
<i>Jesus! Looks like somebody</i>
<i>took a can opener to the thing.</i>

564
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,671
Oh, man!
Look at that engine.

565
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,591
It's torn to pieces.

566
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,068
Pedro!

567
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,958
Damn it!
Where are you?

568
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,597
<i>Hey! There he is!</i>

569
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,035
<i>Pedro?</i>

570
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,951
Oh, God!

571
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,076
Oh, God!

572
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,713
Whoa! It's a whole
new ball game.

573
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,711
A whole new
goddam ball game.

574
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,268
Well... Well, you know
what to do, right?

575
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,158
Right?
I don't know shit!

576
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,988
<i>Okay! Okay!</i>

577
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,913
We can hike over
to that radio tower.

578
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,357
Th-Th-They've gotta
have a radio that's working.
We can, uh... We can call direct.

579
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,034
14 May. 1900 hours.

580
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,317
I've been out of radio contact
for several hours,

581
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,473
unable to reach Grady and Earl
or anybody at H.Q.

582
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,713
The situation dictates
that I return to base.

583
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,037
A further mystery:

584
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:35,317
<i>I've not had a single</i>
<i>seismic reading in hours,</i>

585
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,870
yet I tracked one
of the sightless brutes
right into this valley.

586
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,397
Where the hell did he go?

587
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,311
They do get smarter.

588
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,231
Is it possible he learned...

589
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:52,678
to avoid the unique sound
of my deuce-and-half's
mil-spec engine?

590
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:56,309
I do not have the answer
at this time.

591
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,951
<i>Oh, no, no, no. Don't tell me</i>
<i>that's the radio stuff.</i>

592
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,873
<i>I can't believe this.</i>

593
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:17,229
Oh, man!
Can't we ever
get a goddam break?

594
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,754
If we get outta here alive,
I'll count that as a break.

595
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,513
I mean, there wasn't
even any people here to eat.

596
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:26,434
<i>They're doing this</i>
<i>on purpose, man.</i>

597
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:29,193
They're cuttin' us off
on purpose!

598
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,193
Shh! Shh!
Quiet! Quiet!

599
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,999
I told you
they get smarter.

600
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,350
Hey, look.

601
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,799
Oh, yes! Yes!

602
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,871
It's not gonna have a key.

603
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,635
So I'll hot-wire
the damn thing.
I like that.

604
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,830
<i>Grady! Grady!</i>

605
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:12,037
What is that?
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>but it's comin' this way.</i>

606
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,915
<i>Jesus! How big is this thing?</i>

607
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,231
What the hell is that?

608
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,709
Is that it?

609
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,439
Sure ain't no damn ostrich.

610
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:03,230
How does a 30-foot worm
turn into that little thing?
Shh! Might hear us.

611
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,394
Shit! It heard us.

612
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,991
Wait.

613
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,277
We got it!

614
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,311
We got it!

615
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,031
Ugly little toad.

616
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,591
No eyes.

617
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,353
Wow!
Just like the big ones.

618
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,871
Earl, man. We oughta
take this one with us.

619
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,110
You crazy?
What?

620
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:06,073
Sounds like a bunch of them!

621
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,629
<i>Come on, man!</i>
<i>Let's go! Let's go!</i>

622
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,029
- I'm tryin'! I'm tryin'!
- Let's go!

623
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,431
<i>Pedro. Can you hear me?</i>

624
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,556
<i>Earl, come on!</i>
<i>Talk to me.</i>

625
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,514
Burt? Anybody?

626
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,398
God! What the hell
is going on?

627
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,671
Oh, man!
Hey!

628
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,389
Julio, man, you
scared me half to death!
Sorry.

629
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:28,552
Oh, shit.
You know the radios...
They're out?

630
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,790
I know.
That's what I've
been doin' here.

631
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,189
I think the repeater towers
are down.

632
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,953
How can that be?
I don't know.

633
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,871
Something
coming our way?

634
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:42,351
No! The creatures have
completely disappeared
off the screen. It's weird.

635
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:45,910
With the radios all out,
shouldn't everybody come back?

636
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,594
Yeah, everybody should have
been here a long time ago.

637
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:51,399
I don't like this.
This is not good.

638
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,789
Okay, stay here
with the seismos.

639
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,110
I'm going to go look for them
right now.

640
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:59,033
Okay, but...

641
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,549
Oh, my God!

642
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,631
Oh, no!

643
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,835
No! No!

644
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,031
<i>Get him!</i>

645
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,918
<i>Get him!</i>

646
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,551
<i>Bastards!</i>

647
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,392
Kate!
What are they?

648
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,233
We don't know.
The worms change somehow.

649
00:59:56,320 --> 01:00:00,871
Now we've got these things.
Julio! Julio!
They... They...

650
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,077
- I know. I know.
<i>- We got them, though.</i>
<i>We just blew 'em away!</i>

651
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,196
Pedro! Did Pedro find you?

652
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:09,477
No. They jumped his truck.
He's dead too.

653
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:16,034
Have you seen Burt?
Did he get back?

654
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:21,558
No. I tried to call him.
I tried you. The radio...
<i>Uh, excuse me.</i>

655
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:24,757
But I think
we should get goin'.

656
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,400
You okay?
Uh-huh. Yeah.

657
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:37,240
- Oh, no!
- Not again!

658
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:53,674
They wrecked our car,
Pedro's truck, the radio tower.
How can they be so smart?

659
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,876
Let's get
our butts inside.

660
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,911
<i>What the hell</i>
<i>we gonna do?</i>

661
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,913
Get these windows shut!
It's like they got
the whole thing planned.

662
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,913
Grady! Grady! Come on!
All right. How many
do you think there are?

663
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,831
All right,
I remember. I remember.

664
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:13,629
There was three big sacks,
or bags, in that one
we saw split open.

665
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:17,599
<i>Huh, Earl? Can't be more</i>
<i>than three of those things</i>
<i>in each worm.</i>

666
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,875
Yeah, I... I...
That's right, I guess.

667
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:22,599
Kate, how many big worms
were left out there?

668
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:25,831
You killed all but eight
graboids. I was watching.

669
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,595
So if all eight of them changed,
that would make, uh...

670
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,636
Twenty-four!
Twenty-four
of those things left!

671
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:34,359
How many have you killed?
Well, let's see...

672
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,876
We, uh... We killed
one on the radio tower
and... and one out there...

673
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,599
and, um, on top of the car.

674
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:44,036
That's it?
Well, I'm sorry.

675
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:47,510
No. It's just that I mean...

676
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,431
Oh, man!
Now what?

677
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,115
Thank God, it's Burt.

678
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,789
Yes!
They didn't get him.

679
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,951
I think they did get him.

680
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,157
<i>Burt!</i>

681
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,877
Burt, you okay?

682
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,631
<i>Burt?</i>

683
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:43,191
I feel I was denied...

684
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:48,513
critical, need-to-know
information.

685
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,671
Well, we're sorry, Burt.

686
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,629
They just changed
all of a sudden, man.

687
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:59,838
<i>We would have warned you,</i>
<i>but they knocked out</i>
<i>the radio tower.</i>

688
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,111
Come on, Burt!
What happened?

689
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,749
Well, when the radios
went out,

690
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:09,229
I decided to return
to the refinery.

691
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:14,394
<i>But en route, I find</i>
<i>I'm in an ambush situation.</i>

692
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,994
Must have been a couple
of dozen of these things!

693
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:22,473
I dropped the first wave
with semi auto fire,
but they just kept coming.

694
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:27,270
Most were in front of the truck,
so I popped it in six-wheel
and ran 'em down.

695
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:30,272
The ones that got on board,
I handled with a combination...

696
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:33,557
of small arms fire
and hand-to-hand techniques.

697
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:40,874
I am completely out of ammo.

698
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:47,871
That's never
happened to me before.

699
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:50,793
<i>Well, shit!</i>
<i>Who cares, Burt?</i>

700
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,348
Sounds like you
killed 'em all, huh?

701
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,716
I hope not.
These creatures
are very important.

702
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,951
You know,
I mean scientifically.

703
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,190
That fact was
not lost on me.

704
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:08,193
When it was all over,
I saw one of the little
S.O.B. S was just stunned.

705
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,231
So I detained him.

706
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,755
Oh, man,
it's drooling.

707
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,957
<i>Don't let him spook ya.</i>

708
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:54,271
<i>That line</i>
<i>is 1,000-pound test.</i>

709
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,148
<i>Go on.</i>
<i>Haul him out of there.</i>

710
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,711
Hold on to that
son of a bitch!

711
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:09,631
I'll get the door.

712
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,392
I knew it.
Infrared.

713
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:30,233
It doesn't hear us;
it doesn't actually see us;

714
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:33,278
it senses the heat
of our bodies.

715
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:37,148
See that?
The thing that rises up
must be the heat sensor.

716
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:51,550
You feel that?

717
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:54,473
Gives off a lot of heat
when it screams.

718
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:03,318
That's it.

719
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,631
I bet that's the way
they communicate.

720
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,711
The sound doesn't matter.

721
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:12,588
<i>They make noise,</i>
<i>but they signal each other</i>
<i>with their body heat.</i>

722
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:16,389
It only sees heat?
Yes, that's not so weird.

723
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,789
A rattlesnake
strikes at body heat.

724
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:23,949
That's why
they tore up the cars...
because the engines were hot.

725
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,474
<i>They thought it was food.</i>

726
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,869
<i>And the same thing</i>
<i>with the radio tower.</i>

727
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,474
That electronic gear
puts off all kinds of heat.

728
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:34,154
So basically, they bite
anything that's warm.

729
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,834
They been actin' so smart
'cause they're so stupid?

730
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,519
Now, that's not warm.
How does he know to eat that?

731
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,955
Well, it tastes it
with its tongue.

732
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:58,191
See how he's draggin'
his tongue all over.

733
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,191
<i>Touches anything</i>
<i>he likes, uh,</i>

734
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:03,033
he eats it.

735
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,509
How much can he eat?
Those M.R.E. S aren't cheap,
you know.

736
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,517
Looks like he's had enough.

737
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,558
<i>You're feeding it too much!</i>
<i>You made it sick.</i>

738
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,677
Give me a break.
Probably your nasty food
made it sick.

739
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,196
Oh, good God!

740
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:08,071
Hermaphrodites.

741
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,599
They reproduce
without having sex.

742
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:22,196
I claim the little one.
Hey, it was my food!

743
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:26,353
Whenever one of them gets
enough food, they just bla-a-ah,
and there's another one.

744
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:29,318
Then one makes two,
two makes four,

745
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,436
four makes eight...
It's exponential.

746
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:36,071
Well, uh, hell.
That gives 'em quite an edge.

747
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:38,720
You never see this
in higher animals. Ever!

748
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,631
It's astounding.

749
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,551
Don't you guys get it?

750
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,074
Oh, we get it.
We just don't want it.

751
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:46,999
<i>The little one's</i>
<i>getting big already.</i>

752
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:48,911
<i>Uh, I think we better</i>
<i>think about leaving.</i>

753
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,675
These guys have taken
a completely different
evolutionary path.

754
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:05,839
They got into your damn
super-food, Burt!

755
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,751
Go! Go!

756
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:10,354
Yeah! Yeah!

757
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:13,000
The warehouse! We
gotta close the warehouse!

758
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,355
Oh! Oh!

759
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,074
This way!
Grady! No!

760
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:22,038
<i>No! Not that way!</i>
<i>Grady!</i>

761
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,510
Grady, damn it!

762
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,751
All right! All right!
This isn't gonna work.

763
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:31,274
Shit!

764
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,831
They stopped.

765
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:49,071
They're just milling around.

766
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:51,833
Looks like they
lost track of us.
That's not gonna last.

767
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,358
We're like
sittin' ducks here!

768
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:58,795
Well, it looked like
a goddam building!

769
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:03,271
Why didn't you listen to me?
These little snappers
are blind and deaf.

770
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,316
We've gotta
be able to beat them.

771
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:33,836
I told ya,
they can't see us.

772
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,912
Great, now what?
Now, move with me.

773
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,116
Move?

774
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:42,351
It's gonna work, damn it.
Now move! And step, and step,

775
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:47,036
and step and step...
I don't know how you
come up with this shit.

776
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:49,509
I think on my feet.

777
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,431
Come on! It's working.

778
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:55,399
Comin' at ya.
Okay. All right.

779
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:57,755
And down.

780
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,957
So...

781
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,634
where are we going?

782
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,871
Are there
any more cars left?

783
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,951
Um, uh, yeah.

784
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:22,919
One. Julio's.
It's by the storage tank.

785
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,037
- Which way?
- Left. Move left.

786
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:30,238
<i>Okay. Ready and moving left,</i>

787
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:34,791
and step, and step, and step,

788
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,474
<i>and step and step.</i>

789
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,477
Okay, it's
not much further.

790
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:48,310
Oh!

791
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:52,310
There's one
of them out there!

792
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:55,198
Oh, shit!
Did it see you?

793
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:59,239
Well, if it had, I think
we'd be hearing about it by now.

794
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:01,151
How far is it?

795
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:03,674
Uh, uh, 100 yards about.

796
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:06,513
<i>That's a heck of a shot.</i>

797
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:08,716
Uh-huh.

798
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,758
Whoa! You got
only one shot?
Then you gotta hit it...

799
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:16,231
<i>before it sends one of those</i>
<i>heat signals to the others.</i>

800
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,390
I know.

801
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:27,071
Cover your ears.

802
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:41,277
Oh, Jesus.

803
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,076
Jesus!

804
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:48,436
<i>God! You smoked his ass.</i>

805
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:51,637
Doin' what I can
with what I got.
Good.

806
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,357
Oh, shit, partner.

807
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,157
Oh, no! Pop the hood.

808
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,277
<i>I got it, I got it.</i>

809
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,237
Damn!

810
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:17,875
We're dead.

811
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,831
What?

812
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,115
I didn't know.
How could I've known?

813
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:32,073
We're supposed to be
up against graboids!
I wanted maximum penetration.

814
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:34,310
- Well, you've got it.
<i>- Now what?</i>

815
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:37,437
<i>We can't stay here.</i>
<i>We've got to get inside.</i>

816
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,351
Uh,

817
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:42,271
Cantina!

818
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,792
Damn!

819
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:24,754
Burt?

820
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:26,671
Uh-oh!

821
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,751
Burt!

822
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,517
Oh, no, Burt!

823
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:13,037
<i>Burt, it's working;</i>
<i>They can't find you.</i>
<i>Don't move.</i>

824
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:17,318
Good! Good idea.

825
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:25,437
This is pathetic!

826
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:29,713
Wait a minute!
I've got a plan,
I think!

827
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,751
<i>Earl! Earl!</i>

828
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,638
Yeah, I know! I know.
I just need another second.

829
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:59,398
Ow! Ow!
Shit! Ouch!

830
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:05,071
<i>That's great!</i>
<i>Uh, here. Here.</i>

831
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,631
Get ready to run.

832
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:11,109
We're gonna head
for those oil towers
and climb.

833
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:28,639
Yes! Earl,
you're a genius.

834
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:33,674
Come on!
It's clear. Hurry.

835
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,555
You're okay.
They can't climb.

836
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:41,870
Watch your shin.
Oh, man!

837
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:45,236
They can't climb.
Pretty slick, my man.

838
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:47,470
Slick?
That was brilliant.

839
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:49,676
You really do think
on your feet, don't you?

840
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:51,591
Yeah, well.

841
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,631
Hey, where's Burt?

842
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:58,599
Oh, over here.
And don't worry, they can't
even find him in there.

843
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:01,513
Oh, man.
I think he's gonna
be okay for now.

844
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:09,400
Oh, I'm just dandy!

845
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:11,710
So what do we do now?

846
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,195
Hey, Burt!

847
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:21,114
Are you sure you don't
have any more bullets?
Did you check all your pockets?

848
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:28,558
You know, as I lie here,
I can't help but comment:

849
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:33,395
The reason I am out
of nine millimeter rounds
is I was not properly briefed.

850
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:37,792
<i>And the reason</i>
<i>for that is this mission</i>
<i>was not properly researched.</i>

851
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:41,589
If certain people had bothered
to gather intelligence
on the creatures...

852
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:43,910
before bumbling
into the situation...

853
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,072
Knock it off, Burt!
Nobody made you come.

854
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:51,836
When we should be packing
full-auto, preferably belt-fed!

855
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,753
Shut up!

856
01:18:54,840 --> 01:19:00,198
<i>They're Precambrian life forms.</i>
<i>How's anybody supposed to</i>
<i>research Precambrian life?</i>

857
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:02,635
What difference
does it make now?

858
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:06,429
We're stuck on a goddam roof
with a bunch of whatsits
trying to eat us.

859
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:09,193
I've done this before,
and I did not like it.

860
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:13,717
Okay. It's all my fault!
So things didn't work out
exactly the way we planned.

861
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,870
If I had the right tools,
I'd finish the job!

862
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:19,316
Jeez! Would you
just all relax?

863
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:24,235
<i>Now, look. Nobody's</i>
<i>heard from us since last night,</i>

864
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:28,871
<i>which means pretty soon</i>
<i>they're going to be up here</i>
<i>looking for us, right?</i>

865
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:34,080
So all we have to do
is sit and wait. Okay?

866
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:39,557
Burt?

867
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:44,471
Okay.

868
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:15,113
So I figured I wanted to learn
some Spanish, and six months in
Mexico would be an adventure.

869
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,718
So, uh...

870
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,591
Seeing anybody?

871
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:34,197
Not since
the monsters arrived.

872
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:38,432
Well, you know, you...

873
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:41,990
spend a couple of days
almost getting killed,
you start, uh,

874
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:44,196
thinking about your future
and...

875
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:46,999
Thinking you
should date more?

876
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:49,594
Well, uh,
yeah, actually.

877
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,319
Uh, look, uh,

878
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:58,154
I just don't meet that many
women who can keep their cool...

879
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:00,196
in a situation like this.

880
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:06,829
What I mean is that, uh...
What matters to me is that
a woman can handle herself.

881
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:08,831
It's much more important
than what she looks like.

882
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:12,629
Thanks a lot.
Aw, come on!
You look great.

883
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:17,356
Enough guys
have told you that.
Yeah, well.

884
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:20,238
Believe it or not,
I made my living
as a model once upon a time.

885
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:22,151
I put myself
through college.

886
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:24,231
I believe it.
I was a...

887
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:27,949
I was even a Playmate once.

888
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:31,715
About gave my dad
a heart attack.

889
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:37,675
What?
October '74?

890
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:40,911
Shit!

891
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:49,355
Yup!

892
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:52,998
<i>Uh, guys. Guys!</i>

893
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:56,993
Oh, my God.
Look at that.

894
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:06,317
Goddam little...
heat seekers.

895
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:09,358
<i>What do we do, Earl?</i>
<i>You gotta stop asking me!</i>

896
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:12,830
<i>I don't know!</i>
What's goin' on?

897
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:14,751
What's happening?

898
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,631
Uh-oh.

899
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:31,398
Smart little bastards.

900
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:33,311
Whoa! Oh!

901
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:48,354
Come get me, you suckers!
You hungry?

902
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:51,273
<i>- A hundred and eighty-five</i>
<i>pounds of lean meat.</i>
- Burt, what are you doing?

903
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,191
You know you want it!

904
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:57,714
Burt!
Burt!

905
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:02,673
What is wrong
with him?
Has he got a plan?

906
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:06,116
Burt's always
got a plan...
usually.

907
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,391
Yes!

908
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,871
Problem solved.

909
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:28,191
You maniac!

910
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:30,316
Who-oo!
<i>Oh, Burt,</i>
<i>you did it!</i>

911
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:32,630
You tricked
the little plug uglies!

912
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:35,951
How's it feel
to be so stupid?

913
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,990
Who-oo!

914
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:46,439
Oh, Christ!
Did they find something to eat?

915
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:51,116
- Uh, what's in there, Kate?
- I don't know...
boxes, supplies.

916
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:54,317
<i>Golosinas...</i>
<i>Dulce.</i>

917
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:57,358
Hell, uh...
<i>Dulce. Dulce.</i>

918
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:00,830
Sweet! <i>Golosinas...</i>
I know this one. Snack.

919
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:04,310
Sweet snack food?

920
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,436
Rice flour.

921
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:10,031
I didn't know!
How could I've had known?

922
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:12,554
God! Don't they
ever get tired of eating?
There'll be 100 of em.

923
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:15,234
Okay, we're gonna
run for it!
What?

924
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:17,276
Where?
We're not gonna make it!

925
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:20,716
<i>Look! Earl, I'm sorry.</i>

926
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,439
I'm sorry I got you
all into this.
<i>Come on, Grady.</i>

927
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,353
We ain't dead yet.

928
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:31,400
Okay! Come on!

929
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:33,471
Okay, what, what,
what, what, okay?

930
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:35,869
Uh, I've got a plan!
Sorta.

931
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,276
You're gonna
squirt me with this.

932
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:44,272
- That's great! CO2...
It'll make you cold.
- Right. They won't see me.

933
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:47,079
Says who?
No, they're right;
it oughta work.

934
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:49,230
For how long?
Well, we gotta
try something!

935
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:54,348
- But what is the point?
- If I can just get to your
truck, I can grab some bombs.

936
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:57,955
- This is nuts!
- Well, yeah, and...

937
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:00,270
Let me do it!
It was my idea!

938
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:04,239
No, I got you all into this.
It's my fault.
I'm going in. Spray me!

939
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:07,869
We gotta do it
before they break out.
Now, blast me!

940
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:12,152
Oh, Jesus!

941
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:15,038
- Yes!
- No! Rock rips through paper.

942
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:18,874
Huh!
I go! Give me that shirt.
I need the gloves too.

943
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:23,478
You ready?
Here goes.

944
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,476
Man, this stuff is cold!

945
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:44,437
Okay, here goes.

946
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:47,239
Lock this door behind me.
Lock it?

947
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:51,313
<i>Yeah. I'll get the bombs</i>
<i>and go out the other door.</i>

948
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:53,356
All right.

949
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:31,870
Sounds like it's working.

950
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:38,428
I can't see anything.
Over here.

951
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:52,797
Here!

952
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:56,554
Holy tamole!
There's dozens of em.

953
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:58,471
Good Lord.

954
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:03,680
Wait a minute!
Paper wraps rock, doesn't it?

955
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,832
Paper <i>always</i> wraps rock.

956
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:08,990
Damn!

957
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:20,477
He's startin' to melt!
<i>Earl, you're melting!</i>

958
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:24,269
Step on it!
Come on! Go, go, go!

959
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:39,156
Damn! They see him.

960
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:44,515
Uh... rope!
We need rope or something.

961
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:47,637
Hang on, Earl!
A hose! There's a hose
down by the fire hydrant.

962
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:06,270
<i>Here you go.</i>

963
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,708
Ah! It's too short!

964
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:24,514
<i>Did you hear me?</i>
<i>The hose is too short.</i>

965
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,750
Burt, hurry!

966
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,756
Oh!

967
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:45,438
- Heads up, Earl!
Grab it! Come on!

968
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:00,077
Go! Run!
Run! Go!
I set a bomb.

969
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:03,357
What?
It's the only thing
I could think of.

970
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:15,438
Kate, what did he do?
Grady?
Come on!

971
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:19,274
Where the hell are the bombs?
I didn't have time.
I just threw one in your truck.

972
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,476
You what?

973
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:24,472
That's two-and-a-half tons
of high explosives!

974
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:27,597
You sayin' that's not enough?
God, Burt! Don't tell me
it's not enough!

975
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:30,274
Not enough! Never mind.
Never mind. Just run!

976
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:32,191
Faster!

977
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:38,239
No, no, no! Keep going.
It's gonna be big.

978
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,709
<i>Big!</i>
Is he serious?

979
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,439
Uh, Burt knows his bombs.
How big can it be?

980
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:47,356
How long did you set it for?

981
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:50,159
I don't know;
I just pushed it.

982
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:52,913
God, it's going to be big.
Big!

983
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:08,073
All right, this will have to do.
Get down; stay down; cover
your ears. It's gonna be <i>big!</i>

984
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:11,835
- Is it gonna be today?
- Grady, get your ass down!

985
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:21,597
Oh!

986
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:50,316
Hey, Grady. Grady.
Grady, you all right, man?

987
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:54,031
You okay?

988
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:57,430
Yeah. Thanks.

989
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:00,876
Oh!
Watch yourselves.

990
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,277
Whew!

991
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:33,189
Wow!

992
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,555
Wow!

993
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:40,509
You know, Grady.
Some people think
I'm overprepared.

994
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:42,830
Paranoid.

995
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:45,753
Maybe even
a little crazy.

996
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:49,549
But they never met any
Precambrian life forms,
did they?

997
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:59,190
Uh, look, uh...
I don't mind hangin'
around down here for awhile.

998
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:01,111
Gonna have any free time?

999
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:05,716
<i>Well, spend a couple days</i>
<i>almost gettin' killed,</i>

1000
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:08,633
you start
thinkin' about your future.

1001
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:13,038
Thinkin' you
should date more?

1002
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:16,112
Well, yeah, actually.

1003
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:20,557
<i>Hey, Earl, I just realized</i>
<i>they owe us for 28 worms, man.</i>

1004
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:24,034
Hey, that's right.
We didn't die.

1005
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:28,354
Although, we did kinda
blow up their refinery.

1006
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:31,398
Hey, that's just
part of the job.

1007
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:34,199
In fact, we oughta charge them
for all those little ones too.

1008
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:38,671
Oh, yeah. We'll have enough
to start our own theme park...

1009
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:40,796
Grady and Earl's
Monster World.

1010
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:42,711
Hey, no way!

1011
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:46,076
Come on, Earl. This could
be like your big, third chance.
