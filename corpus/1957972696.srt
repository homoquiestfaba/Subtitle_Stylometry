1
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,605
All right.
Elena is ready.

2
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,747
- Probably 15 seconds.
- Copy, 15.

3
00:00:30,685 --> 00:00:31,686
One hundred.

4
00:00:56,504 --> 00:00:57,436
Hi!

5
00:00:57,471 --> 00:01:00,094
- Who is this?
- Elena.

6
00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:02,510
I don't remember
getting into it,

7
00:01:02,545 --> 00:01:06,238
but I know I was just the most
competitive child in the world.

8
00:01:06,273 --> 00:01:08,792
I hated to lose
when I was a kid.

9
00:01:08,827 --> 00:01:09,862
Eleven-years-old.

10
00:01:09,897 --> 00:01:11,554
Wow! Look out for her.

11
00:01:11,588 --> 00:01:14,119
She is the future of women's
snowboarding, and that's Elena Hight.

12
00:01:14,143 --> 00:01:16,731
She was top dog
at a very young age.

13
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:18,008
The rest of us were like,

14
00:01:18,043 --> 00:01:19,734
"Whoa, man, you made
finals. Nice work."

15
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:23,083
Elena was, like, for sure in
finals and probably on the podium.

16
00:01:24,843 --> 00:01:26,914
Just landing into
the top of transition.

17
00:01:26,948 --> 00:01:29,744
Feel like, she came in
with some aggressiveness.

18
00:01:29,779 --> 00:01:33,403
I was like, "Oh, that's why
they call you Mighty Mouse."

19
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:35,509
One, two... Oh!

20
00:01:35,543 --> 00:01:38,512
Never been done.
Female or male...

21
00:01:38,546 --> 00:01:41,860
She was a dominant competitive
figure for so many years.

22
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:43,758
That is huge.

23
00:01:43,793 --> 00:01:47,693
Taking women's half-pipe
snowboarding to the next level.

24
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,356
It's hard to walk away from something
that you know you're good at,

25
00:01:55,391 --> 00:01:59,705
that you haven't quite accomplished
everything you wanted to accomplish.

26
00:02:01,604 --> 00:02:03,157
It's hard to know

27
00:02:03,192 --> 00:02:04,503
when that moment is

28
00:02:04,538 --> 00:02:07,472
that you're not going
to regret pushing harder,

29
00:02:07,506 --> 00:02:10,647
but also feeling the pull
of your heart

30
00:02:10,682 --> 00:02:12,442
is taking you
in a different direction.

31
00:02:13,478 --> 00:02:15,514
You can see the blue skies.

32
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:20,174
To me, it just seems
like many of my friends,

33
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:24,316
she's come to this point where the
contests just really weren't doing it.

34
00:02:24,351 --> 00:02:26,215
It wasn't inspiring, you know,

35
00:02:26,249 --> 00:02:29,321
and this is like something she can
really sink her teeth into again

36
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:31,461
and do what she did
in the contest world

37
00:02:31,496 --> 00:02:34,292
and go and do that
in freeriding.

38
00:02:34,326 --> 00:02:36,190
It looks like I would
need to kind of, like,

39
00:02:36,673 --> 00:02:37,812
redirect.

40
00:02:37,847 --> 00:02:41,954
This transition to
the backcountry is scary.

41
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:44,302
I'm not a seasoned veteran.

42
00:02:44,336 --> 00:02:47,063
And I'm learning
along the process,

43
00:02:47,097 --> 00:02:50,204
and that is kind of scary.

44
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,413
It doesn't look
too crazy over here.

45
00:02:52,448 --> 00:02:54,174
All right.

46
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:55,289
There's so much more involved

47
00:02:55,313 --> 00:02:56,693
than just the snowboard

48
00:02:56,728 --> 00:02:58,143
in backcountry riding.

49
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,534
And when you go
into the mountains,

50
00:02:59,558 --> 00:03:03,666
you're forced into
a place of observation

51
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,428
which takes presence
and it's always changing.

52
00:03:09,568 --> 00:03:11,260
It's very nerve-racking

53
00:03:11,294 --> 00:03:13,710
walking away from what I've done

54
00:03:13,745 --> 00:03:15,505
for the past 15 years

55
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,233
and going to this avenue
that had a lot to learn

56
00:03:19,268 --> 00:03:22,132
and no real idea if I'm
going to succeed or fail,

57
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:27,621
but I feel like just the experience
is worth taking the leap.

58
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:29,726
All right.
Elena dropping in ten.

59
00:03:32,764 --> 00:03:37,424
Five, four, three, two, one.

60
00:03:59,446 --> 00:04:03,243
You know, with as much
travel as I have

61
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:05,279
been doing in my career,

62
00:04:05,314 --> 00:04:08,696
waking up at home is
just such a treat in itself.

63
00:04:08,731 --> 00:04:11,734
I haven't really spent
an entire winter at home

64
00:04:11,768 --> 00:04:14,392
or even a month
of a winter at home

65
00:04:14,426 --> 00:04:15,807
since I was, like, 15.

66
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:20,605
So it's pretty cool to
be off the contest scene

67
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,746
and also have a winter
like this lined up in Tahoe

68
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:28,164
where I can stay home
and explore.

69
00:04:28,198 --> 00:04:29,821
Yeah, it's pretty...
Pretty special.

70
00:04:34,826 --> 00:04:36,690
I feel very fortunate
to grow up here,

71
00:04:36,724 --> 00:04:39,106
and, you know, my parents
worked really hard

72
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,282
so that we could live in this beautiful
place and be surrounded by nature

73
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:44,180
and we would go riding at night,

74
00:04:44,214 --> 00:04:45,871
we'd go every weekend.

75
00:04:45,906 --> 00:04:48,391
My parents would drive me all
around the lake for USASA events,

76
00:04:48,426 --> 00:04:51,325
and we'd all get together and
run around the mountain together

77
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,913
and cause trouble.

78
00:04:52,947 --> 00:04:56,779
You know, it's just a really
tight-knit community here.

79
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:58,815
Looks good.
It's a double stager now.

80
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,301
I think you should hit it.

81
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:04,200
There's a lot of really amazing
snowboarders here in Tahoe

82
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:06,892
and a lot of people that I've
looked up to for a long time

83
00:05:06,927 --> 00:05:09,757
and really wanted to get
those people here

84
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:11,725
and run around
our backyard together.

85
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,072
So, ride us right to the rock
or ride us left to the rock.

86
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:17,593
So we've got
Nick Russell, Danny Davis,

87
00:05:17,627 --> 00:05:20,078
and a couple days out
with Sammy Luebke.

88
00:05:22,736 --> 00:05:25,566
You know, when you're out
deep in the mountains,

89
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:28,914
the people that you're with
are really so important.

90
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:30,813
They are your safety net.

91
00:05:30,847 --> 00:05:32,262
They're your confidence boost.

92
00:05:32,297 --> 00:05:34,851
They're like the ones that
are keeping the vibes high,

93
00:05:34,886 --> 00:05:36,543
passing along wisdom

94
00:05:36,577 --> 00:05:38,476
and I've been really,
really fortunate

95
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,064
to be out with a lot of really
amazing people this year.

96
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:49,383
Oh, yeah, this is the zone now.

97
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:51,385
- Pretty cool.
- Wow.

98
00:05:52,904 --> 00:05:57,909
Yeah. Variable day
out here on our snowboards,

99
00:05:57,943 --> 00:06:00,256
riding with two
of my longtime friends,

100
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,432
Nick... Russell

101
00:06:04,225 --> 00:06:06,780

We're kind of scoping
some of the stuff that, like,

156
00:09:28,947 --> 00:09:32,123
inspired me to become
a snowboarder essentially.

157
00:09:32,157 --> 00:09:33,607
All of these zones

158
00:09:33,642 --> 00:09:36,990
are what I watched
on repeat in the films,

159
00:09:37,024 --> 00:09:40,994
and it's pretty cool to be
out in these legendary zones,

160
00:09:41,028 --> 00:09:43,617
and it makes you appreciate
where snowboarding comes from

161
00:09:43,652 --> 00:09:45,205
and where it's going.

162
00:09:51,521 --> 00:09:52,557
Let's go, Sun.

163
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,008
Come on, Sun.
Let's do this.

164
00:09:55,491 --> 00:09:56,837
I'm ready.

165
00:09:56,872 --> 00:09:59,702
Jeremy Jones
is the first person to ride

166
00:09:59,737 --> 00:10:02,498
Grizzly Spines and Paradox.

167
00:10:04,534 --> 00:10:08,677
You know, a line as serious
as the Grizzly Spines,

168
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:10,851
um, if something happens,

169
00:10:10,886 --> 00:10:13,751
you know,
the consequences are high.

170
00:10:13,785 --> 00:10:15,960
I remember
vividly riding a line,

171
00:10:15,994 --> 00:10:17,686
kind of came over the roll

172
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,549
and there's really
nothing there.

173
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:21,551
It's like super airy below,

174
00:10:21,586 --> 00:10:25,832
it's so steep, you couldn't
come to a stop if you wanted to.

175
00:10:25,866 --> 00:10:28,144
Pulled out
by the skin of my teeth,

176
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:32,493
and I'm not sure I could
go back and repeat it.

177
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:35,289
Paradox was one of my
favorite movies as a kid.

178
00:10:35,324 --> 00:10:36,843
I think it was just...

179
00:10:36,877 --> 00:10:39,673
It came out at a time when I was
really watching a lot of videos

180
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:42,918
and it was really
groundbreaking at the time.

181
00:10:42,952 --> 00:10:44,333
There was a lot of exposure,

182
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:47,923
and Jeremy just went up there
and slayed it.

183
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:51,133
Standing on top of this line

184
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:54,136
that I've been looking at
in photos forever.

185
00:10:55,102 --> 00:10:56,102
It's down there.

186
00:10:57,622 --> 00:10:59,728
Been on top of this thing
for about an hour,

187
00:10:59,762 --> 00:11:02,109
just waiting for the sun to pop.

188
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,146
Just waiting.

189
00:11:05,388 --> 00:11:06,907
Patience is a virtue.

190
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,292
Oh, man.

191
00:11:12,326 --> 00:11:13,914
Really hard call right now.

192
00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:17,607
Looks like there's
more clouds rolling in.

193
00:11:17,642 --> 00:11:19,471
Let's, uh, call it.

194
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:23,096
Looked epic to ride,

195
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,892
and knowing that Jeremy was
the first person to ride it

196
00:11:25,926 --> 00:11:27,548
and he's been
such an inspiration to me

197
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:31,242
and helping me, like, step
into this new life really.

198
00:11:31,276 --> 00:11:35,349
Like, Jeremy's been such
a big part of that for me.

199
00:11:35,384 --> 00:11:38,180
The generation before me
really has made

200
00:11:38,214 --> 00:11:41,045
what seemed impossible
really possible,

201
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:44,773
which has been kind of
the inspiration for me

202
00:11:44,807 --> 00:11:46,498
to continue on what I'm doing.

203
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:58,509
Whoo!

204
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:04,654
Go now.

205
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:05,725
Whoo-hoo!

206
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,116
The creek is giving us traction.

207
00:12:20,222 --> 00:12:23,639
Yep, we got this.
We got it. And we're out.

208
00:12:23,673 --> 00:12:25,227
- Good job, Elena.
- And we're out.

209
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,579
Cruising, getting lost
in nowhere Japan.

210
00:12:32,613 --> 00:12:34,684
Break nowhere apart is now here.

211
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:36,031
So we're here right now.

212
00:12:36,065 --> 00:12:37,105
There's so many mountains,

213
00:12:37,135 --> 00:12:39,034
so many little
mom and pop ski resorts.

214
00:12:39,068 --> 00:12:40,898
And it's just limited
by your imagination.

215
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:43,383
Walking around
the forests of Japan.

216
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,144
How's that there?

217
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:50,252
Whoo!

218
00:12:56,845 --> 00:12:58,260
Yeah. Great.

219
00:12:59,192 --> 00:13:00,745
Putting together this trip,

220
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,230
Hana was like
a no-brainer for me.

221
00:13:03,265 --> 00:13:05,819
She really has brought me
into the backcountry

222
00:13:05,854 --> 00:13:07,994
and shared her passion of it

223
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:09,409
with me throughout the years

224
00:13:09,443 --> 00:13:12,377
and she just loves
snowboarding more than anyone

225
00:13:12,412 --> 00:13:16,347
and that essence is really...
It's contagious.

226
00:13:20,696 --> 00:13:23,078
I just think this is
such a beautiful opportunity

227
00:13:23,112 --> 00:13:24,976
for her to go and experience

228
00:13:25,011 --> 00:13:27,254
all the different
kinds of snowboarding.

229
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:29,394
And it's really cool to be,
like, passing along

230
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:31,131
some of the knowledge
I've picked up to her.

231
00:13:31,155 --> 00:13:32,846
Right here and then I thought...

232
00:13:32,881 --> 00:13:36,125
And seeing her
determination and energy

233
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,403
is fulfilling me
in a different way.

234
00:13:38,438 --> 00:13:39,853
- Yeah!
- Hana!

235
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:44,582
Fun, huh?

236
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,687
See there's a couple...
in there.

237
00:13:46,722 --> 00:13:47,999
Ended up talking to Travis

238
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:49,563
and he was like,
"I'm going to be in Japan."

239
00:13:49,587 --> 00:13:51,900
I'm like, "I want to
snowboard with you girls."

240
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:54,178
- No, it's right here.
- So close there.

241
00:13:54,212 --> 00:13:55,662
I was over here with

242
00:13:55,696 --> 00:13:59,459
one of my dearest Japanese
riding partner Shin Biyajima.

243
00:13:59,493 --> 00:14:02,876
We were gonna be just travelling,
exploring some new areas.

244
00:14:02,911 --> 00:14:05,223
Worked out too perfect
not to jump on it.

245
00:14:07,053 --> 00:14:10,504
I've always looked up to him and the
things that he does on a snowboard

246
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:14,888
and he has elevated
snowboarding in a lot of ways.

247
00:14:14,923 --> 00:14:17,304
There's always
stuff out in the backside.

248
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:20,169
It doesn't feel like there's
a ceiling in freeriding.

249
00:14:20,204 --> 00:14:23,241
You're limited by
your own creativity.

250
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:24,208
- Coming!
- Yep.

251
00:14:24,242 --> 00:14:26,693
There are endless set-ups

252
00:14:26,727 --> 00:14:29,627
in the mountains with snow
conditions, terrain features.

253
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,491
It's endless.

254
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:33,355
Whoo!

255
00:14:34,252 --> 00:14:35,495
To be in the backcountry

256
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:38,947
and see the way, like,
Hana looks at features

257
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:41,328
differently than Travis
looks at features,

258
00:14:41,363 --> 00:14:44,228
it's just super inspiring
and exciting

259
00:14:44,262 --> 00:14:46,747
because you really
can ride things

260
00:14:46,782 --> 00:14:48,197
however you want to.

261
00:14:49,578 --> 00:14:52,512
- We're pretty legit off the backside.
- It's pretty big.

262
00:14:52,546 --> 00:14:55,446
Feel better about it,
now that I see the landing.

263
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,930
- Right?
- Yeah.

264
00:14:56,965 --> 00:14:58,380
Backcountry riding, free riding,

265
00:14:58,414 --> 00:15:00,900
you know, it comes from
an internal compass

266
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,211
of, "Where do I wanna take this?

267
00:15:02,246 --> 00:15:03,557
How do I wanna approach it?

268
00:15:03,592 --> 00:15:05,697
Where do I wanna go with it?"
It's fascinating.

269
00:15:05,732 --> 00:15:07,941
I've loved all components of it.

270
00:15:07,976 --> 00:15:11,945
There's no straightforward way to learn
it except by going out and doing it

271
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,465
and it's really
great to see Elena's

272
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:18,503
authentic interest
in exploring it.

273
00:15:19,608 --> 00:15:20,885
Have fun.

274
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,680
- Will do.
- Just ridin', pal...

275
00:15:32,793 --> 00:15:35,451
You'd enter at the top big open

276
00:15:35,486 --> 00:15:38,247
and then you'd have to wriggle
through to get around that.

- Just don't crash, just dump it.
- Yeah.

357
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,625
Yeah, okay.

358
00:19:49,015 --> 00:19:51,673
Oh, my God.

359
00:19:51,707 --> 00:19:53,053
Yeah!

360
00:19:53,088 --> 00:19:55,366
She went so big.

361
00:19:57,023 --> 00:19:58,231
What do you think?

362
00:19:58,266 --> 00:19:59,301
You want another?

363
00:19:59,336 --> 00:20:01,752
I'm good.
I'm good.

364
00:20:08,931 --> 00:20:11,727
Oh, my God.
That looks so sick, dude.

365
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:50,352
Snowboarding as an industry

366
00:20:50,387 --> 00:20:52,492
really grew up in Tahoe.

367
00:20:52,527 --> 00:20:55,806
It was an epicenter
of filming and contests

368
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,671
and people just
thriving on the sport.

369
00:20:58,705 --> 00:21:02,882
And it's been so cool
to go back to these spots

370
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,193
that I watched as a kid,

371
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:05,712
being like, "Wow,
I remember this.

372
00:21:05,747 --> 00:21:08,059
"And this inspired me
so much as a kid,"

373
00:21:08,094 --> 00:21:09,785
to attempting to do

374
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,684
the same thing
that they were doing.

375
00:21:11,718 --> 00:21:14,411

00:26:10,845 --> 00:26:13,710
All right!

445
00:26:19,647 --> 00:26:21,269
Holy

446
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:24,962
Whoo!

447
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:26,757
It was fun.

448
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,764
Thanks, Tim.

449
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:35,870
When I heard that
Elena pulled it,

450
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,872
I mean, I just was blown away.

451
00:26:37,906 --> 00:26:40,495
I don't know. It's just
a huge accomplishment.

452
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:43,222
And the fact
that she is a female

453
00:26:43,256 --> 00:26:46,052
just makes it that much
cooler and clear

454
00:26:46,087 --> 00:26:48,607
that when Elena sets
her mind on something,

455
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:51,161
as she's done with freeriding,

456
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:54,060
she is a freak.

457
00:26:54,095 --> 00:26:55,959
And there's very few people

458
00:26:55,993 --> 00:26:58,375
at that level of riding.

459
00:26:58,409 --> 00:26:59,859
That was so fun.

460
00:27:11,871 --> 00:27:13,321
I've never been up this way.

461
00:27:14,702 --> 00:27:15,875
Wow.

462
00:27:16,773 --> 00:27:17,981
Dropping.

463
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:27,956
We are in Pemberton,
British Columbia.

464
00:27:27,991 --> 00:27:29,855
I'm really excited
to be posted up

465
00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:31,684
out here with Jake Blauvelt.

466
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:33,617
We were kind of intertwined

467
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,378
in circles of
my competitive career

468
00:27:36,413 --> 00:27:37,794
and, you know, as I grew up

469
00:27:37,828 --> 00:27:39,796
and he kind of stepped away
from competitions

470
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,970
and into backcountry
snowboarding.

471
00:27:42,005 --> 00:27:44,110
I followed his career
and was always so impressed.

472
00:27:44,145 --> 00:27:48,011
And you could just really see
his creativity shining through.

473
00:27:55,743 --> 00:27:57,399
Those human-eating holes.

474
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,681
- What a beauty.
- Mmm-hmm.

475
00:28:03,889 --> 00:28:05,028
Wow.

476
00:28:05,545 --> 00:28:06,754
Wow.

477
00:28:09,204 --> 00:28:11,724
I think this has
completely changed

478
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:13,553
my perspective on snowboarding

479
00:28:13,588 --> 00:28:15,038
and what is possible

480
00:28:15,072 --> 00:28:17,937
and where I want to take my
snowboarding in the future.

481
00:28:19,836 --> 00:28:23,011
It's exciting to kind of
hone in on an idea

482
00:28:23,046 --> 00:28:25,082
and kind of see a door open

483
00:28:25,117 --> 00:28:29,190
and just really step
into the mountains

484
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:30,225
and some silence

485
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:34,505
and get back to
the roots of snowboarding.

486
00:29:03,362 --> 00:29:05,088
Whoo!

487
00:29:20,379 --> 00:29:23,382
- That was huge.
- That was so good.

488
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:25,315
All right, man.
Let's get down there.

489
00:29:31,355 --> 00:29:33,254
- Hey.
- Yeah.

490
00:29:48,131 --> 00:29:49,339
Yeah!

491
00:29:50,133 --> 00:29:52,376
- Wow.
- Whoo-hoo!

492
00:29:53,895 --> 00:29:55,241
Hell, yeah.

493
00:29:55,276 --> 00:29:56,771
I think the really
cool thing about Jake

494
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,349
and what I've loved about
being in the mountains with him

495
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:03,905
is just his eye for
being able to draw lines

496
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,080
down mountains really creatively

497
00:30:06,114 --> 00:30:08,151
is unlike anyone
I've ridden with.

498
00:30:08,185 --> 00:30:10,739
So to see that and learn
from that first-hand

499
00:30:10,774 --> 00:30:12,362
is, like, really special.

500
00:30:13,018 --> 00:30:14,882
Okay. Dropping.

501
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:38,837
Whoo! Holy fuck.

502
00:31:09,488 --> 00:31:10,592
Yeah, Elena.

503
00:31:11,386 --> 00:31:12,386
Yeah!

504
00:31:29,508 --> 00:31:30,889
Whoa!

505
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,700
Oh!

506
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:54,257
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

507
00:31:54,291 --> 00:31:55,292
Looks good!

508
00:32:03,404 --> 00:32:04,405
Whoo!

509
00:32:11,688 --> 00:32:12,965
Whoa.

510
00:32:29,706 --> 00:32:30,706
Holy shit.

511
00:32:32,157 --> 00:32:33,157
Wow.

512
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
Wow.

513
00:32:35,884 --> 00:32:37,369
Wow. Wow.

514
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:47,448
It's on now. Pretty cool.
Almost got you, sorry.

515
00:32:50,209 --> 00:32:52,971
Every step of the way, I'm
learning something new.

516
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:54,293
That's what's so
exciting about it,

517
00:32:54,317 --> 00:32:56,595
is that you don't know
what you're gonna find

518
00:32:56,629 --> 00:33:00,392
and it really brings out the
creativity and, and the freedom

519
00:33:00,426 --> 00:33:03,015
to, like, see the mountain
in different ways.

520
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:06,018
And it really just connects you

521
00:33:06,053 --> 00:33:07,295
to that present moment,

522
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:10,781
and I think gives you insight

523
00:33:10,816 --> 00:33:13,129
to where you're supposed to be,

524
00:33:13,163 --> 00:33:15,855
and you stop living
so much in your head

525
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:18,375
and more in your heart,

526
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,964
and really more in just
what's in front of you.

527
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,692
Which I mean, I think that that's
what we're all striving for.

528
00:33:40,846 --> 00:33:42,192
Yes!

529
00:33:42,641 --> 00:33:43,780
Yes!

530
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:45,299
What a wild style!

531
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:47,749
I mean, sanely.

532
00:33:49,096 --> 00:33:50,476
Hey, guys.

533
00:34:01,556 --> 00:34:04,594
- Hey.
- Everybody's okay?

534
00:34:04,628 --> 00:34:07,148
Yeah, everything good.
We are very careful.

535
00:34:07,183 --> 00:34:09,978
Thank you for looking
out for our well-being,

536
00:34:10,013 --> 00:34:12,705
comma, I hope we
get to meet again.

537
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,501
San Diego Police,
take note, for God's sakes.

538
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:19,333
Whoo! We're doing it.

539
00:34:22,129 --> 00:34:23,682
Someone pulls up next to me,

540
00:34:23,716 --> 00:34:25,339
"You're on fire!"

541
00:34:25,373 --> 00:34:27,893
And I look down
and there's just flames

542
00:34:27,927 --> 00:34:29,412
ripping out my exhaust.

543
00:34:32,932 --> 00:34:34,106
Jason, just be careful.

544
00:34:34,141 --> 00:34:36,108
There's a road at the back.

545
00:34:36,143 --> 00:34:37,420
There's a road.

546
00:34:39,698 --> 00:34:42,252
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

547
00:34:42,287 --> 00:34:44,047
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

548
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,600
Just like any raffle, baby,

549
00:34:45,635 --> 00:34:48,638
you gotta be present
to win your prize.

550
00:34:56,024 --> 00:34:57,854
Oh.

551
00:34:57,888 --> 00:35:00,339
Whoo!
Oh, violent.

552
00:35:00,374 --> 00:35:03,135
- Jesus.
- I'm okay.

553
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:05,517
Are there any roads down there?

554
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:07,795
No. No roads.

555
00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:08,865
- Yeah.
- Whoo!
