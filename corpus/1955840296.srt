1
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:15,154
I have become death,
the destroyer of worlds.

2
00:01:39,688 --> 00:01:43,426
After the failed invasion
Nephilim of the mid-21st century

3
00:01:43,427 --> 00:01:47,577
The victorious humanity
it expanded throughout the galaxy.

4
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:54,677
By the end of the 22nd century, humanity
I had divided into two different species.

5
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:58,922
The Homo Sapiens and the
genetically superior ...

6
00:01:58,923 --> 00:02:02,914
... Homo Technicus. Also
known as the Construct.

7
00:02:03,315 --> 00:02:09,133
With the passage of each generation the
homo sapiens were decreasing.

8
00:02:09,134 --> 00:02:15,177
Until in the year 2820, only one
a handful of human colonies survived.

9
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:25,936
Humanity's End

10
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,500
New Shanghai
Capital of Pleiades.

11
00:04:36,935 --> 00:04:38,495
They are too many!
Resist!

12
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,348
Shit!

13
00:04:49,008 --> 00:04:50,540
Contact Sheetak

14
00:04:51,264 --> 00:04:54,858
Look to see if there is someone
and to evacuate!

15
00:04:55,797 --> 00:04:57,581
We have to raise the alarm.

16
00:04:58,402 --> 00:05:00,902
Find those who remain and get out of here!

17
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,648
Contact the Blue Whale!

18
00:05:16,851 --> 00:05:18,585
- We have to evacuate.
- Right now?

19
00:05:18,838 --> 00:05:20,936
That's an order.
We have to go out into space.

20
00:06:27,238 --> 00:06:29,980
Orion 2
Repair Station.

21
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,973
It was seven years ago.

22
00:06:50,185 --> 00:06:52,285
When we were under
the command of the Konstrukts ...

23
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:55,127
went to his museum,
there was an auction ...

24
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:56,997
but nobody bought anything.

25
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,860
That's when I saw Blue Whale.

26
00:06:59,156 --> 00:07:01,431
She was lying on the side.

27
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:04,521
I'm surprised there was a
auction of old reliquaries.

28
00:07:04,743 --> 00:07:07,418
Nobody cares about that old ship
which is behind the museum.

29
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:09,777
In addition everyone wants to make money.

30
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:13,463
I decided to stay with her.

31
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,086
How old are you?

32
00:07:15,298 --> 00:07:18,316
I do not know. I guess 10,000 years.

33
00:07:18,317 --> 00:07:21,204
But inside is a
Virgin on her honeymoon.

34
00:07:21,646 --> 00:07:24,716
They already gave me the tour,
It smelled pretty bad.

35
00:07:24,975 --> 00:07:26,581
We are doing a total repair.

36
00:07:26,786 --> 00:07:28,659
First the engines,
then the interior.

37
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,843
I was thinking about
a beautiful decoration.

38
00:07:31,053 --> 00:07:32,476
I had never seen that in
a running ship.

39
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,499
Yes, without mentioning
military torpedoes.

40
00:07:35,526 --> 00:07:36,351
Yes.

41
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:40,403
Also taken from the PDD,
on the 28th and 22nd ...

42
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:43,379
She will be the fastest ship ...
in the sector!

43
00:07:43,561 --> 00:07:45,895
Nothing of Vera.
This is the great moment!

44
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:48,848
- Captain.
- Do not do that.

45
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:51,348
Transmission of Konstrukt 3.
- I'm fishing.

46
00:07:51,816 --> 00:07:53,261
Why are you fishing?

47
00:07:54,547 --> 00:07:56,962
It's the stupidest question
what have they done to me all day?

48
00:07:57,287 --> 00:07:59,759
You were supposed to be in
Konstrukt 3 this morning.

49
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:02,282
What is the trouble?
Just keep waiting.

50
00:08:02,467 --> 00:08:04,524
What's inside the package
is what interests us.

51
00:08:04,758 --> 00:08:06,879
Well, you'll have them when you have them.
Agree?

52
00:08:07,441 --> 00:08:08,940
So, three days.

53
00:08:09,216 --> 00:08:10,944
But if they pay more money,
and buy more fuel ...

54
00:08:11,156 --> 00:08:12,413
they will have it faster.

55
00:08:13,217 --> 00:08:18,025
Roj, did you ever let that
Your crotch will be stocked?

56
00:08:19,826 --> 00:08:23,800
- You mean sex?
- You should try it sometime.

57
00:08:23,801 --> 00:08:27,177
It would be good for you.
It will relax you a little.

58
00:08:27,178 --> 00:08:28,478
You know, put it in mmm.

59
00:08:28,636 --> 00:08:31,311
When will we receive the merchandise?
- In two days.

60
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:33,112
Putos contructores!

61
00:08:34,503 --> 00:08:36,953
Derasi, I finished the repair.

62
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,304
It was already time.
Let's get out of here.

63
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,373
There are no fish here.
I did not catch anything all day.

64
00:08:47,648 --> 00:08:49,983
- You're done?
- I'm connecting the injectors.

65
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,949
- Blue?
- He only touched them by arribita.

66
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,467
I should see how it was.

67
00:08:53,702 --> 00:08:55,976
It is the only mechanic in 60 light years.

68
00:08:57,933 --> 00:09:00,777
Mira gets a bit of a fool,
because he is only happy when he pilots.

69
00:09:00,995 --> 00:09:02,845
Yes, I know his bad mood.

70
00:09:04,182 --> 00:09:06,188
- And the attacks?
- I do not care.

71
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:07,999
They destroyed three human worlds.

72
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,244
<i> There are always wars somewhere. Has
the final verifications and let's go. </ i></i>

73
00:09:11,648 --> 00:09:13,365
I heard it was Nathalon.
- Who?

74
00:09:13,569 --> 00:09:15,015
Another hybrid human.

75
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,372
They added alien DNA to
his system. It's very dangerous.

76
00:09:18,638 --> 00:09:20,530
They are classified as Homo-superior.

77
00:09:20,729 --> 00:09:22,638
I'm not interested in politics
nor the hybrids.

78
00:09:22,844 --> 00:09:24,409
- Maybe you should do it.
- To the captain bridge.

79
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,254
That seems like an order.
- I'm sorry, captain.

80
00:09:26,464 --> 00:09:27,574
What did you call me?

81
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,916
Captain.

82
00:09:29,177 --> 00:09:31,005
Yes, I am the captain,
I give the orders ...

83
00:09:31,272 --> 00:09:32,675
and you obey them.
- You...

84
00:09:32,945 --> 00:09:35,185
I know you want to look good
in front of your clone friends,

85
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,294
but on this ship ...
- It's Sheetak.

86
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:39,543
It's urgent, he says he needs ...

87
00:09:39,715 --> 00:09:41,767
Very good.
Why did not you take her to my cabin?

88
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:45,687
And you, make sure you check
the cables before you leave.

89
00:10:03,576 --> 00:10:05,574
- Derasi?
- Sheetak, did you miss me?

90
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:06,920
This is not the moment.

91
00:10:07,126 --> 00:10:09,067
I heard about the crisis.

92
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:10,987
I have something to tell you.

93
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:13,112
Where are you?
- In Pleiades 5.

94
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:15,341
A sperm bank?

95
00:10:15,564 --> 00:10:18,564
You left me because you did not want children
and you're in the damn sperm bank.

96
00:10:18,912 --> 00:10:21,542
...to the humans.
They have vaporized everyone.

97
00:10:21,805 --> 00:10:23,680
- What are you flying?
- An elliptical tank.

98
00:10:23,681 --> 00:10:27,017
First you have to confuse them.

99
00:10:27,214 --> 00:10:29,787
I need you Derasi.
- Sheetak.

100
00:10:42,689 --> 00:10:44,898
We're going to the Pleiades system.

101
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:47,331
But we have to go to ...
- She needs us.

102
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,594
Are you ready Blue?
- Starting the engines.

103
00:10:54,468 --> 00:10:57,038
Sublighted engines.

104
00:10:57,598 --> 00:11:01,783
Hello?
Does anyone listen to me?

105
00:11:03,352 --> 00:11:04,808
Curse.

106
00:11:06,303 --> 00:11:08,272
387 is a hero.

107
00:11:25,265 --> 00:11:30,577
Pleiades NMR system.

108
00:11:33,932 --> 00:11:36,462
25 light years in 20 minutes.
Your best time Blue.

109
00:11:37,349 --> 00:11:40,036
- What's going on?!
- You're still here?

110
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:43,549
I was checking your cables
when you started the engines

111
00:11:43,793 --> 00:11:45,224
Why did not you tell anyone?

112
00:11:45,428 --> 00:11:48,167
Because it is the central core.
I could have fried there.

113
00:11:48,464 --> 00:11:50,509
- I doubt it.
- Increase speed.

114
00:11:50,722 --> 00:11:52,043
Where is my ship?

115
00:11:52,785 --> 00:11:54,230
I guess next to the reactor.

116
00:11:54,468 --> 00:11:56,193
- Blue?
- Yes, it's still there.

117
00:11:56,413 --> 00:11:58,510
It's right in front.

118
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,478
This would never happen in
a ship of the fleet.

119
00:12:00,693 --> 00:12:02,505
Calm and active
communications.

120
00:12:02,976 --> 00:12:04,684
- You took your time.
- Better late than never.

121
00:12:04,902 --> 00:12:07,486
I'm on my way to NMR, I need your help.

122
00:12:07,687 --> 00:12:09,311
Where is the head of the fleet?

123
00:12:10,954 --> 00:12:12,209
They are gone.

124
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,103
- Where did they go?
- They died.

125
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,456
- Something big is coming.
- They came back.

126
00:12:17,566 --> 00:12:19,875
Leave everything you have
and get out of there.

127
00:12:19,995 --> 00:12:21,617
- I have no chance.
- Ships are approaching.

128
00:12:23,882 --> 00:12:25,651
General, we have company.

129
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:28,802
- I'll open fire.
- Copied. Watch out!

130
00:12:46,411 --> 00:12:48,702
I'm falling.
- Load the Blue torpedoes.

131
00:12:49,025 --> 00:12:50,550
- Which?
- The illegals.

132
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:52,217
- What?
- Armed torpedoes.

133
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:53,980
Greet me to Jesus.

134
00:12:55,271 --> 00:12:57,246
- The torpedoes are illegal ...
- I do not see any police around here.

135
00:13:05,768 --> 00:13:07,395
Turning on
leveling impellers.

136
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:13,347
Take that!

137
00:13:14,192 --> 00:13:15,873
I'm here.
- There are two more.

138
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:17,845
It was everything we had.
Start praying.

139
00:13:18,156 --> 00:13:19,421
I am already praying.

140
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:33,335
State.

141
00:13:33,555 --> 00:13:35,352
Low atmosphere. Y
one more pursues us.

142
00:13:35,545 --> 00:13:36,976
Let's go there.
- No way.

143
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,115
Yes.
- I will not leave the load.

144
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,449
- And your ship?
- Is small.

145
00:13:41,644 --> 00:13:43,291
- Can we land?
- Not fast enough.

146
00:13:44,134 --> 00:13:46,192
- Rewrite.
- You promised me Derasi ...

147
00:13:46,506 --> 00:13:47,971
I'm sorry, baby
Let's go there.

148
00:13:48,181 --> 00:13:50,555
Derasi connect me again.

149
00:13:56,152 --> 00:13:57,191
Did you understand?

150
00:13:58,319 --> 00:13:59,621
Leave that here.

151
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:02,402
Do not shoot unless you're sure.
- It is understood.

152
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,705
- Aim well.
- Yes. I will not fail.

153
00:14:05,122 --> 00:14:06,009
Shut up.

154
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:12,687
There is no sign of these things.

155
00:14:13,092 --> 00:14:15,980
- What a bad smell.
- Yes, it smells like a cabin.

156
00:14:17,603 --> 00:14:19,871
- This was the ocean.
- Do you think you're a professor?

157
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,819
If I were a captain I would move away
as soon as possible from here.

158
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:26,095
You are not a captain so
do not try to think

159
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:28,583
- I do not like...
- You know what?

160
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,652
I'm sorry captain, I'm going to shut up
and I will do what they tell me,

161
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,755
Because I do not know how to do anything else!

162
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:37,418
- I found them.
- All right.

163
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,951
They answered your prayers.

164
00:14:47,017 --> 00:14:49,041
Come on, shoot now!

165
00:14:56,356 --> 00:14:58,523
- I saw what you did.
- What?

166
00:14:58,735 --> 00:15:00,467
You signed me up
- x

167
00:15:00,675 --> 00:15:01,959
You signed me up!

168
00:15:03,674 --> 00:15:05,941
- Clones.
- They are not human.

169
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,417
They are ugly.
- And you too.

170
00:15:17,914 --> 00:15:19,734
Do not shoot,
we are humans!

171
00:15:21,316 --> 00:15:23,020
He does not.

172
00:15:32,377 --> 00:15:35,224
Sorgon 387.
Clone released.

173
00:15:42,995 --> 00:15:44,551
They thought they were exterminated.

174
00:15:44,764 --> 00:15:46,754
They found a hiding place
in Vera.

175
00:15:47,022 --> 00:15:49,326
It is not a hiding place if you
You say it to the whole world.

176
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,932
Take my hands off my coat.

177
00:15:53,866 --> 00:15:57,655
So ... where is Sheetak?

178
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,147
The pilotaba that was in the area.

179
00:16:08,142 --> 00:16:10,173
The ship is overheated.

180
00:16:10,372 --> 00:16:12,198
- Start the engines.
- Wait 30 seconds.

181
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:13,919
Rewrite.
Try turning on the motors.

182
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:23,838
- Are you upset?
- Enters.

183
00:16:25,672 --> 00:16:27,423
It had been 7 years since you saw her.

184
00:16:29,427 --> 00:16:30,694
Yes.

185
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,216
- I know that...
- What the fuck do you know ?!

186
00:16:42,317 --> 00:16:44,523
Half of the fleet is
at our disposal,

187
00:16:44,524 --> 00:16:47,000
but our people will not serve
next to your drones ...

188
00:16:47,601 --> 00:16:51,666
The Konstrukts are not easy
to dominate like the homo-sapiens.

189
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,241
If we continue acting
on the margin of our ...

190
00:16:54,242 --> 00:16:56,888
... advice, our fleet
and technology will be removed.

191
00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:00,057
You require modification
genetics. The violence...

192
00:17:00,058 --> 00:17:02,888

 s ... animal is an insult
to your Nephilistic wound.

193
00:17:14,172 --> 00:17:15,836
What happened?

194
00:17:19,648 --> 00:17:21,379
I am...

195
00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:26,174
Idiot, take the schoolgirl out
from here.

196
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:27,557
My name is Alicia.

197
00:17:27,734 --> 00:17:29,902
- How?
- Alicia.

198
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,739
Breeder of class A, Alicia.

199
00:17:34,498 --> 00:17:36,272
Take her to the ship.

200
00:17:36,465 --> 00:17:38,332
He is...
I have to ask.

201
00:17:38,506 --> 00:17:40,945
They castrated him from birth.

202
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,801
Do not think about sex.

203
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:53,324
Come on Mr. Twinkle,
I can not leave you behind.

204
00:18:04,896 --> 00:18:06,609
I had seen other breeders,

205
00:18:06,913 --> 00:18:08,642
but she seems more capable.

206
00:18:10,441 --> 00:18:11,760
I'm glad you're here.

207
00:18:12,005 --> 00:18:14,299
Junior Frietag.
- Derasi Vorde.

208
00:18:14,856 --> 00:18:16,784
He was a pilot of ... you know.

209
00:18:17,711 --> 00:18:21,808
Does the Derasi Vorde of the
offensive of Pleiades?

210
00:18:22,615 --> 00:18:24,740
Look, that was a long time ago.

211
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:29,669
PediCrime's life changed
after your Martial Cut.

212
00:18:30,024 --> 00:18:30,778
Look, I do not ...

213
00:18:30,963 --> 00:18:33,312
That offensive was just a massacre!

214
00:18:33,505 --> 00:18:35,675
Well, we all make old mistakes.

215
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,010
You're smart.

216
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:43,111
- You live there, do not you?
- 7 years ago.

217
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:46,622
There are no humans there.

218
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:49,900
- Do you know anything about the other colonies?
- There are no other colonies.

219
00:18:50,137 --> 00:18:52,046
- Yes, good...
- There is none left.

220
00:18:52,238 --> 00:18:53,374
Not even one.

221
00:18:54,123 --> 00:18:56,444
They used bio-robots to infiltrate.

222
00:18:57,754 --> 00:18:59,921
They had been there for years.

223
00:19:00,255 --> 00:19:02,022
And they gave the signal.

224
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:07,911
We could not even form a fleet.

225
00:19:08,111 --> 00:19:11,063
Everything disappeared in a matter of days.

226
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:13,400
There must be someone
in some place. I'm here.

227
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:16,009
We search for months.
Pleiades is dead.

228
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,944
Not the least trace.

229
00:19:19,244 --> 00:19:24,400
Well, the Konstrukts will have rescued
to some to take them home.

230
00:19:24,905 --> 00:19:26,163
They must be safe.

231
00:19:26,392 --> 00:19:30,779
Our technical friends formed
an alliance with the Nephilim.

232
00:19:31,232 --> 00:19:33,417
You go there and you will be executed.

233
00:19:33,521 --> 00:19:34,683
I have a contract
2. 3. 4

234
00:19:34,713 --> 00:19:36,220
So I have some protection.

235
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:38,399
Listen to me, boy

236
00:19:38,618 --> 00:19:41,881
The Nephilim date from
millions of years ago...

237
00:19:42,261 --> 00:19:45,531
just like the Konstrukts,
They want us all dead.

238
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,265
It is not so strong general.

239
00:19:53,487 --> 00:19:59,162
You ... and I are the last
men in the galaxy.

240
00:19:59,683 --> 00:20:01,796
There is not much left of you.

241
00:20:07,357 --> 00:20:12,776
But Alici ...
is his daughter?

242
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,339
She is the last one we have left.

243
00:20:18,112 --> 00:20:20,011
How disgusting ...

244
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:25,742
that a man of your ilk
Put your hands on it.

245
00:20:26,616 --> 00:20:28,577
If you and she ...

246
00:20:29,807 --> 00:20:32,961
maybe...
- He's hallucinating.

247
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:36,439
They have no other option
than having a child

248
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:42,849
First we fight and then ...

249
00:20:43,032 --> 00:20:44,444
There's nothing left.

250
00:20:44,638 --> 00:20:46,480
The military fell first.

251
00:20:47,256 --> 00:20:50,922
You, regroup and hide.

252
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,488
There is a military secret,
on the planet Mars.

253
00:20:56,313 --> 00:21:00,063
All illegal weapons
of the War of Liberation.

254
00:21:00,272 --> 00:21:02,199
I have two rules in my life.

255
00:21:02,426 --> 00:21:04,455
I do not go out with stupid girls
with super developed ovaries,

256
00:21:04,876 --> 00:21:07,191
and I'm not going to prohibited areas
of radiation.

257
00:21:09,313 --> 00:21:11,379
You know what's good for you
- Yes

258
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:12,974
So listen.

259
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:15,721
The human race is exhausted.

260
00:21:15,951 --> 00:21:18,293
Nothing remains.
Does not exist.

261
00:21:20,325 --> 00:21:23,644
You are all that remains.

262
00:21:30,614 --> 00:21:32,026
General?

263
00:21:51,123 --> 00:21:56,907
World Konstrukt.

264
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:58,554
We welcome you to
our empire Nehilim.

265
00:21:58,589 --> 00:22:00,000
We welcome you under
the Empire of Nephilim.

266
00:22:00,648 --> 00:22:03,502
We recognize your responsibility with
our DNA, now we will be a single race!

267
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:13,098
The Homo-Sapien DNA has been
exorcised from our universe.

268
00:22:13,133 --> 00:22:18,208
Soon immortality will be ours,
as it was before the Lords Nephilim.

269
00:22:40,134 --> 00:22:42,732
Our alliance with
your ridiculous people are ...

270
00:22:42,734 --> 00:22:45,330
... based on you deliver
the DNA code.

271
00:22:46,318 --> 00:22:50,958
We have dispatched a small fleet to
Collect it from your remote location.

272
00:22:51,442 --> 00:22:55,819
The genocide of the Homos-sapiens
changed the course of our plans.

273
00:22:56,031 --> 00:22:58,059
We do not tolerate criticism
to our policy.

274
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,340
Make the delivery as you promised
or we will burn the planet.

275
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:08,069
We are Homo-technis, and I do not know
It can intimidate us with violence.

276
00:23:22,585 --> 00:23:24,087
Is everyone dead?

277
00:23:24,802 --> 00:23:26,579
That's what the general said.

278
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,439
But there are colonies and seasons
throughout the galaxy.

279
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:33,116
Well, they found the
way to penetrate them.

280
00:23:34,512 --> 00:23:35,944
The question is:

281
00:23:36,143 --> 00:23:37,314
Why are we still alive?

282
00:23:37,615 --> 00:23:39,351
You were hiding
on the most remote planet ...

283
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:41,124
out of space.

284
00:23:42,275 --> 00:23:44,085
Well, I'm not going to hide anymore.

285
00:23:51,347 --> 00:23:53,196
Damn Konstrukts!
Move Blue!

286
00:23:53,243 --> 00:23:55,720
- They do not come so fast.
- Why do not they shoot us?

287
00:23:56,002 --> 00:23:57,918
We carry a load that interests them.

288
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,207
- I'm going to release her.
- Hurry up.

289
00:24:09,577 --> 00:24:10,996
- Ready?
- Yes captain.

290
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:12,508
Drop the load.

291
00:24:18,302 --> 00:24:20,633
Put the course to NMR.
- No way!

292
00:24:20,807 --> 00:24:22,491
- Do it!
- Do not you dare!

293
00:24:22,685 --> 00:24:24,742
The regulators ...
- It's not in your control.

294
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,837
They already go twice.

295
00:24:27,771 --> 00:24:29,841
You are making me angry.

296
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,400
Regulators 3 and 4
They are overloaded.

297
00:24:48,623 --> 00:24:50,943
Stabilizes Blue.
- With what?

298
00:24:51,135 --> 00:24:52,969
- Where?
- Anywhere!

299
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,207
Loving You.
- Not there!

300
00:24:55,455 --> 00:24:57,877
Come on!
- We are on our way!

301
00:25:02,523 --> 00:25:05,585
- That was very fair!
- Fair?

302
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,383
For the love of God Derasi.
- Let's go back to NMR.

303
00:25:08,611 --> 00:25:11,171
Do not fuck Captain.
Fix the regulators.

304
00:25:11,446 --> 00:25:13,322
I'm not a member of your crew.

305
00:25:15,352 --> 00:25:16,789
Yes now.

306
00:25:19,775 --> 00:25:20,842
How are you going Blue?

307
00:25:21,092 --> 00:25:24,115
As I am, we will not get far.
- Motin?

308
00:25:24,382 --> 00:25:28,277
The injectors do not work
and the regulators are failing.

309
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:30,173
Good thing you have
to your mechanic on board.

310
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,858
Markus was the mechanic
and he knew it.

311
00:25:33,048 --> 00:25:35,842
- You are nobody...
- Yes, we understand you.

312
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:39,272
How lucky she is here.
Excuse me

313
00:25:40,691 --> 00:25:42,418
I need new injectors.

314
00:25:44,658 --> 00:25:47,452
If we stop at the Finian station
I will give you what you need.

315
00:25:48,012 --> 00:25:49,563
Do you think it's OK?

316
00:25:53,175 --> 00:25:54,782
Everything is fine.

317
00:25:56,642 --> 00:25:58,731
Next time I will have a
crew of men.

318
00:26:03,987 --> 00:26:05,902
I searched for all human frequencies.

319
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,990
Only this is transmitted.

320
00:26:11,892 --> 00:26:13,456
I hate that sound.

321
00:26:14,143 --> 00:26:16,124
What does that mean?

322
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,531
They say that the DNA code of
Homo sapiens has been eliminated.

323
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:23,577
And that the Empire of Nephilim reigns.

324
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:29,281
The Homo-technis, the Homo-superiors,

325
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:32,070
the Konstrukts and the Bio-Clons,

326
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:34,910
must report to the local barracks

327
00:26:35,918 --> 00:26:37,989
to be registered
in the new regime.

328
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:44,039
- Are we just them and us?
- Yes

329
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:52,333
- And Derasi?
- Yes

330
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:10,026
To 4 days of Pleiades and not a whisper
in no frequency.

331
00:27:11,626 --> 00:27:14,528
The odds of
Eating a hamburger are few.

332
00:27:15,525 --> 00:27:17,920
I wish I was happier here.

333
00:27:18,925 --> 00:27:20,965
We see ships Konstrukts in the distance.

334
00:27:22,014 --> 00:27:24,065
We are one day away from Mars.

335
00:27:26,851 --> 00:27:29,005
I hope you have a good hamburger.

336
00:27:30,192 --> 00:27:32,476
Or at least a good
place to fish.

337
00:27:36,866 --> 00:27:41,745
Why is it so cold on this ship?

338
00:27:42,057 --> 00:27:45,110
All ships with well.
Have you been to space before?

339
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,410
I never left Pleiades 5.

340
00:27:47,692 --> 00:27:49,686
It's hotter there, on the beach.

341
00:27:54,542 --> 00:27:56,584
Yes.
Sit down.

342
00:28:12,086 --> 00:28:13,921
How much did you know Sheetak?

343
00:28:14,118 --> 00:28:16,167
She was the head of the program.

344
00:28:17,091 --> 00:28:19,267
Did you ever talk about me?
Surely yes.
3. 4. 5

345
00:28:19,518 --> 00:28:21,202
Never.

346
00:28:21,404 --> 00:28:23,002
But he talked a lot about Freddie.

347
00:28:24,357 --> 00:28:27,371
Why, you and her ...
- Yes. 18 months.

348
00:28:29,061 --> 00:28:31,058
Well, you do not look like your type.

349
00:28:32,594 --> 00:28:34,468
Yes, I suppose not.

350
00:28:36,171 --> 00:28:38,502
Why did you want to be a breeder?

351
00:28:39,596 --> 00:28:42,116
- Do you like sex very much?
- I've never done.

352
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:48,006
The goal was to prepare ...

353
00:28:48,177 --> 00:28:51,117
to restore the human population.

354
00:28:51,965 --> 00:28:53,877
Well, I've been out for a while now.

355
00:28:55,405 --> 00:29:00,525
Well, a disease was
affecting the ovaries.

356
00:29:00,723 --> 00:29:03,007
Mine work so ...

357
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,929
I was happy to be in the program.

358
00:29:09,016 --> 00:29:15,131
Finian Station.
Military deposit.

359
00:29:19,146 --> 00:29:21,465
- There was a mass.
- You threw her?

360
00:29:21,777 --> 00:29:23,592
I left a part in the station.

361
00:29:23,952 --> 00:29:27,317
Put me with Derasi.
- Its busy.

362
00:29:30,793 --> 00:29:33,775
It has been some time,
I hope to be at height.

363
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,578
I need to know your story.

364
00:29:35,601 --> 00:29:37,268
My father was military.

365
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:39,083
He forced me to do many things ...

366
00:29:39,275 --> 00:29:40,974
Your medical history

367
00:29:41,631 --> 00:29:45,297
Well, he broke three bones
When I was 12 years old.

368
00:29:49,917 --> 00:29:52,228
I'm not supposed to touch
to anyone who is less than 90.

369
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:54,073
Well, I'm 39 years old.

370
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,618
Very disgusting.

371
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:37,859
Are you my mom?

372
00:30:39,273 --> 00:30:40,535
What happened?

373
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,522
My mom left.

374
00:30:43,063 --> 00:30:45,181
How long have you been here?

375
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:48,870
Would you be my mom?

376
00:30:51,929 --> 00:30:54,099
I would love to be your mom.

377
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:12,092
Only one robot!
It was a damn robot!

378
00:31:12,685 --> 00:31:17,337
Would you like to be my...

379
00:31:19,817 --> 00:31:22,454
- I'm ovulating.
- I also.

380
00:31:39,291 --> 00:31:41,358
Open the Blue doors.

381
00:31:41,606 --> 00:31:43,542
I'm sorry, Contessa, I can not do that.

382
00:31:43,784 --> 00:31:46,665
Open the damn Blue doors!

383
00:31:51,251 --> 00:31:52,996
Open doors.

384
00:31:53,952 --> 00:31:56,641
It's my first time.
I am a virgin.

385
00:31:57,428 --> 00:31:58,833
It's my first time...

386
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,630
with a virgin.

387
00:32:04,271 --> 00:32:05,739
I am sorry.

388
00:32:12,982 --> 00:32:15,946
That is nice.

389
00:32:17,294 --> 00:32:19,721
- Oh God.
- Yes!

390
00:32:28,249 --> 00:32:30,974
I was absent for a while.

391
00:32:35,592 --> 00:32:37,764
This is strange to me.

392
00:32:40,602 --> 00:32:42,135
I ended up with Sheetak,

393
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:44,089
or she finished with me I ...

394
00:32:44,751 --> 00:32:46,387
She did not want to have a family.

395
00:32:47,587 --> 00:32:50,378
I do not remember.
You wanted this

396
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:54,375
And I do not know, I'm ready
to have a family.

397
00:32:55,196 --> 00:32:57,964
I want, but not so fast.

398
00:32:58,626 --> 00:33:00,623
I want to know you better.

399
00:33:01,411 --> 00:33:05,124
She left 10 minutes ago.

400
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:10,551
I know.

401
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,615
Did you find anything at the station?

402
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,138
What's wrong with me?

403
00:33:17,615 --> 00:33:19,632
You find me attractive, do not you?

404
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,725
Since I knew you, you were
Married to Markus.

405
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:29,896
Markus was older than me and ...

406
00:33:30,505 --> 00:33:32,548
We both miss him.

407
00:33:38,211 --> 00:33:40,257
I like to feel loved.

408
00:33:43,509 --> 00:33:45,151
It's okay.

409
00:33:45,761 --> 00:33:49,610
Markus told me about the days
of forced attacks.

410
00:33:50,505 --> 00:33:52,244
That was 20 years ago.

411
00:33:54,355 --> 00:33:56,673
Did Markus ever take you fishing?

412
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:01,334
Yes, in the winter of 2833.
It was spectacular.

413
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:05,367
I went in 2824.
I caught one 25.7 kilos.

414
00:34:06,992 --> 00:34:09,059
28 kilos?

415
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:11,815
Your arms are very thin.
You are skin and bones.

416
00:34:16,093 --> 00:34:19,770
Do you like Derasi?

417
00:34:26,613 --> 00:34:28,672
You are one of ours

418
00:34:35,768 --> 00:34:37,570
And I have a girlfriend.

419
00:34:38,808 --> 00:34:40,720
Besides, I'm just sperm.

420
00:35:05,523 --> 00:35:06,546
Did you hear that?

421
00:35:06,752 --> 00:35:08,547
It's like that Derasi,
a disaster.

422
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,053
Tell him the truth

423
00:35:11,367 --> 00:35:13,704
I will never tell you.

424
00:35:14,676 --> 00:35:16,301
That is my rule.

425
00:35:18,003 --> 00:35:19,396
Shit!

426
00:35:25,827 --> 00:35:27,778
Nothing good.
Open fire.

427
00:35:28,348 --> 00:35:29,794
With what?

428
00:35:30,521 --> 00:35:32,321
Your present.
- Are you crazy?!

429
00:35:32,565 --> 00:35:34,532
Send me out there and I can
make some holes.

430
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:36,109
Inbound transmission

431
00:35:36,644 --> 00:35:38,318
There is a reason why
they do not use this anymore

432
00:35:38,545 --> 00:35:40,899
- Why do they work?
- I said:Incoming transmission.

433
00:35:41,103 --> 00:35:42,570
I had some of these in my hands ...

434
00:35:42,873 --> 00:35:45,921
and they tend to ... explode
before using them

435
00:35:46,162 --> 00:35:47,197
What do I answer?

436
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:49,431
Ask for the hamburger recipe!
I do not give a fuck!

437
00:35:49,612 --> 00:35:51,774
Onscreen.

438
00:35:52,034 --> 00:35:54,281
Captain, you have orders
to surrender and ...

439
00:35:54,467 --> 00:35:56,347
Why do you follow me?
Go away!

440
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,258
The whole galaxy is looking for you.

441
00:35:58,467 --> 00:35:59,457
We just want to put an end to it.

442
00:35:59,654 --> 00:36:02,357
What if I give you a deposit bag?
Will that make you feel better?

443
00:36:02,732 --> 00:36:04,909
He has no weapons aboard the ship.

444
00:36:05,114 --> 00:36:06,990
Yes, we are faster than you.

445
00:36:07,261 --> 00:36:08,401
The desire of Kons ...

446
00:36:08,595 --> 00:36:11,815
Why do not you feel about this
and you shake your pig?

447
00:36:13,207 --> 00:36:14,965
Do what she says captain.

448
00:36:18,622 --> 00:36:20,617
- Is he one of you?
- It does not leave me another option.

449
00:36:22,031 --> 00:36:23,367
You and them.

450
00:36:24,197 --> 00:36:26,235
5 years of service,
And so you pay me?

451
00:36:26,673 --> 00:36:28,025
Shut up!

452
00:36:28,509 --> 00:36:31,769
- Master pig!
- Monkey brain!

453
00:36:32,448 --> 00:36:34,573
You are in this together,
What do you want from me?

454
00:36:34,808 --> 00:36:36,388
Our stolen ship.

455
00:36:36,651 --> 00:36:41,185
We believe that the corpses contain
the DNA of an ancient Lord Nephilim.

456
00:36:42,108 --> 00:36:44,197
They need this
to be immortal.

457
00:36:44,454 --> 00:36:46,164
- They will share it with us.
- You're a fucking puppet.

458
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:49,789
Do it.

459
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,375
Let it go!

460
00:36:55,448 --> 00:36:57,215
Turn off the screen

461
00:36:57,413 --> 00:36:58,439
You know what?

462
00:36:58,652 --> 00:37:00,641
You have to learn to respect
to your captain

463
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:03,707
Thank you.

464
00:37:10,021 --> 00:37:12,213
Moron!

465
00:37:12,426 --> 00:37:16,635
You had the opportunity to live well.
And you threw her overboard!

466
00:37:17,521 --> 00:37:19,201
My brothers and sisters
They do not have to die.

467
00:37:19,388 --> 00:37:21,794
Yes, that's why you should have stayed
in your position.

468
00:37:22,098 --> 00:37:23,920
Damn slave!

469
00:37:24,134 --> 00:37:25,563
I brought you out of nowhere!

470
00:37:25,831 --> 00:37:27,300
And I made you my first boss!
- Second.

471
00:37:28,411 --> 00:37:29,418
Second!

472
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,492
You treated me like
to a pet, sir!

473
00:37:32,808 --> 00:37:34,179
Do you want to be a captain?

474
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:35,680
You wanna be?

475
00:37:36,336 --> 00:37:37,922
This is your chance.

476
00:37:38,581 --> 00:37:40,236
Captain of an escape pod.

477
00:37:53,734 --> 00:37:55,302
I'm sorry, captain.

478
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,783
Are we still headed to Mars?

479
00:38:03,993 --> 00:38:05,378
We have no other option.

480
00:38:05,594 --> 00:38:07,306
They go to a place called Mars.

481
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,334
What's on Mars?

482
00:38:09,609 --> 00:38:11,649
A human colony, weapons.

483
00:38:12,325 --> 00:38:13,580
Maybe an army.

484
00:38:13,803 --> 00:38:14,509
It seems unlikely.

485
00:38:14,744 --> 00:38:16,397
The whole system is full
of radiation.

486
00:38:16,675 --> 00:38:18,256
We will stay for a few weeks.

487
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:20,033
We will fish, we will look for some weapons.

488
00:38:20,386 --> 00:38:21,810
And then we go to war.

489
00:38:22,004 --> 00:38:23,873
The planet Earth was
destroyed years ago.

490
00:38:24,138 --> 00:38:25,694
There can not be anything in that system.

491
00:38:25,985 --> 00:38:27,864
Follow them until the fleet arrives.

492
00:38:45,382 --> 00:38:48,454
Threatened 387 with
a nuclear weapon?

493
00:38:50,963 --> 00:38:52,522
Hi.
Where were you?

494
00:38:52,721 --> 00:38:53,881
I was tired.

495
00:38:54,342 --> 00:38:57,901
I do not like this, captain we're
releasing plasma from the starter motor.

496
00:38:58,111 --> 00:39:00,052
Why do not you try to stop the leak?

497
00:39:01,307 --> 00:39:02,894
You are not working?

498
00:39:08,418 --> 00:39:11,108
They follow us.
They are more than 18.

499
00:39:11,632 --> 00:39:13,436
Must be more aggressive

500
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:16,784
Is it true what they say
of my processor?

501
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,213
No, it's envy of ships.

502
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:21,343
You are still the bitch more
speed of the galaxy.

503
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:22,723
- Derasi?
- What?

504
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:23,703
Can I talk to you in private?

505
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,851
- After.
- Not now!

506
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:32,236
Wait for me!

507
00:39:44,362 --> 00:39:46,500
If we destroy the ship
we lose everything.

508
00:39:46,737 --> 00:39:49,443
Our fleet will arrive soon.

509
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,696
Your starter motor is weak.

510
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:54,111
We only hit a fraction
and the helmet can be broken.

511
00:39:54,294 --> 00:39:55,401
It will be slow, we can reach it quickly.

512
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:58,206
We destroy it and destroy your planet.

513
00:40:00,928 --> 00:40:02,366
Look, if you have a rash or something ...

514
00:40:02,584 --> 00:40:04,012
it was not me because
I'm clean".

515
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,863
In addition there is no where to choose.

516
00:40:07,653 --> 00:40:09,625
Probably the only one in existence.

517
00:40:12,825 --> 00:40:14,472
It does not taste like beer.

518
00:40:18,293 --> 00:40:21,036
- Yes, I did it myself.
- Go.

519
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:26,026
Yes. Last night she was a little mobile.

520
00:40:27,109 --> 00:40:31,453
Well, really, I expected a little more.

521
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:33,266
Fireworks.

522
00:40:34,848 --> 00:40:36,741
Now you have some.

523
00:40:38,809 --> 00:40:41,472
I just do not feel it with you.

524
00:40:41,793 --> 00:40:43,980
Yes, you felt something.

525
00:40:45,213 --> 00:40:49,317
Look, all that kissing
as if you were my boyfriend.

526
00:40:50,152 --> 00:40:53,500
- It was not for that that I entered the program.
- Let's try it again.

527
00:40:54,863 --> 00:40:58,359
I have a sample of your sperm.

528
00:40:58,601 --> 00:41:02,383
We no longer need to have more sex.

529
00:41:02,468 --> 00:41:06,107
I have samples of ovaries
and Sheetak's eggs.

530
00:41:06,146 --> 00:41:09,091
I can make some links
and do different things.

531
00:41:09,382 --> 00:41:11,527
We need that for a healthy child.

532
00:41:14,601 --> 00:41:17,323
- Can you clone Sheetak?
- Yes

533
00:41:18,283 --> 00:41:20,463
Not without an installation
to make clones.

534
00:41:20,847 --> 00:41:22,662
There is none of those near.

535
00:41:26,793 --> 00:41:29,478
Partner, she went ahead.

536
00:41:31,684 --> 00:41:32,964
Baby.

537
00:41:37,518 --> 00:41:40,944
- Contessa looks at you a lot.
- Do not start with that.

538
00:41:43,817 --> 00:41:45,535
She is beautiful.

539
00:41:45,722 --> 00:41:48,157
- You and her...
- Do not.

540
00:41:52,861 --> 00:41:54,820
Is it your sister or something?

541
00:41:55,177 --> 00:41:57,124
She is married to my mechanic.

542
00:41:57,591 --> 00:41:58,854
I was.

543
00:42:00,413 --> 00:42:01,847
He died.

544
00:42:03,169 --> 00:42:05,391
Is a ghost watching you?

545
00:42:07,472 --> 00:42:09,125
I am going to tell you something.

546
00:42:09,454 --> 00:42:12,759
You can not tell anyone,
You swear?

547
00:42:13,355 --> 00:42:15,130
I swear.

548
00:42:16,723 --> 00:42:18,240
She is a robot.

549
00:42:18,907 --> 00:42:20,054
What?!

550
00:42:20,296 --> 00:42:22,833
Yes, it was a model of pleasure
and reprogrammed it.

551
00:42:23,257 --> 00:42:25,082
She thinks she is human.

552
00:42:25,625 --> 00:42:28,630
We programmed her to fall in love ...

553
00:42:29,092 --> 00:42:31,062
and have a serious relationship.

554
00:42:32,473 --> 00:42:33,829
What are you doing out there?

555
00:42:34,053 --> 00:42:35,930
Long distance pumps.

556
00:42:37,928 --> 00:42:40,024
Does Blue always hear what you are talking about?

557
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:42,414
How about?

558
00:42:43,148 --> 00:42:45,003
She was looking when we were ...

559
00:42:45,217 --> 00:42:47,561
The lights were off
but I heard everything.

560
00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:50,779
All. So Derasi.

561
00:42:50,995 --> 00:42:52,912
Slowly.
Very fast.

562
00:42:53,117 --> 00:42:55,302
It is funny.

563
00:42:55,732 --> 00:42:57,096
You remind me of someone.

564
00:42:57,327 --> 00:42:59,137
She is not a normal AI.

565
00:43:00,698 --> 00:43:02,011
Strange.

566
00:43:02,281 --> 00:43:04,869
You used a famous profile, right?

567
00:43:07,732 --> 00:43:08,875
Where did you find it?

568
00:43:09,061 --> 00:43:10,887
In a Konstrukt museum.

569
00:43:11,821 --> 00:43:13,761
You stole it, do not you?

570
00:43:15,632 --> 00:43:17,601
I like the personality.

571
00:43:18,215 --> 00:43:20,315
But I had to erase his story.

572
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:23,015
You know, change it.

573
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:25,281
Did you do what ...
- Nothing.

574
00:43:25,492 --> 00:43:27,254
What happened to my personality?

575
00:43:29,739 --> 00:43:31,571
Well, you know ...

576
00:43:31,922 --> 00:43:33,350
You were very dominant.

577
00:43:34,729 --> 00:43:36,628
How much did you erase?

578
00:43:37,557 --> 00:43:40,238
Look, you were just a hole,

579
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:45,122
and a micro-processor,
They did not use you thousands of years ago.

580
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:47,339
You're lucky that I put
to work again.

581
00:43:47,544 --> 00:43:49,305
What personality did you use?

582
00:43:50,746 --> 00:43:52,625
- This is good.
- For.

583
00:43:54,521 --> 00:43:57,608
I ... I used Sheetak's personality.

584
00:43:59,561 --> 00:44:01,768
- I knew it!
- She?!

585
00:44:03,658 --> 00:44:06,778
I had some memories
of happy moments.

586
00:44:07,252 --> 00:44:08,693
Do not tell me.

587
00:44:08,944 --> 00:44:10,935
I thought if I merged them ...

588
00:44:11,442 --> 00:44:14,489
You fused my personality
with hers

589
00:44:15,376 --> 00:44:17,557
You evolved distinctly.

590
00:44:18,855 --> 00:44:20,207
Wait a minute.

591
00:44:21,378 --> 00:44:23,211
If she is so old,

592
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:26,426
So it was a Nephilim ship?

593
00:44:27,305 --> 00:44:28,324
Probably.

594
00:44:28,738 --> 00:44:31,029
That's fine, maybe I should
Do not join my family.

595
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:33,721
What are you doing out there?

596
00:44:33,792 --> 00:44:35,162
They are shooting at you
to my starter.

597
00:44:35,163 --> 00:44:36,532
Shit.

598
00:44:39,268 --> 00:44:41,344
Come on Derasi.
Time to be sober.

599
00:44:43,995 --> 00:44:45,484
Blue, keep up the speed.

600
00:44:45,822 --> 00:44:47,445
We are 100%
and they are approaching.

601
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:49,489
- What can we throw at them?
- We can launch an engine.

602
00:44:49,689 --> 00:44:50,740
No way.

603
00:44:50,767 --> 00:44:52,023
The boot does not work.

604
00:44:52,249 --> 00:44:53,973
We put an injector
that explodes when it is close.

605
00:44:54,408 --> 00:44:55,284
Sparkly Let's do it.

606
00:44:55,505 --> 00:44:57,735
They will not resist.
Go do that.

607
00:45:05,139 --> 00:45:06,489
We almost have them.

608
00:45:09,918 --> 00:45:12,227
- What do they do?
- It worked.

609
00:45:12,799 --> 00:45:17,071
No. I know the captain
and his way of acting.

610
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,544
Activate the magnets.

611
00:45:21,967 --> 00:45:23,949
They are already on.

612
00:45:30,279 --> 00:45:31,609
- It's a bomb!
- Shoot!

613
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:33,263
Shield connected.

614
00:45:44,566 --> 00:45:45,574
State.

615
00:45:47,831 --> 00:45:49,248
Helmet destroyed.

616
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:51,292
The engine does not work.

617
00:45:51,512 --> 00:45:52,780
We are not going anywhere.

618
00:45:53,033 --> 00:45:55,268
Do what you have to do
but get close to them.

619
00:45:55,814 --> 00:45:58,591
Very impressive captain.
- Send to others.

620
00:45:58,876 --> 00:46:01,775
Que?
- They will tell us where they land.

621
00:46:23,558 --> 00:46:27,655
Well, we'll land shortly.
I already want to be down there.

622
00:46:29,501 --> 00:46:31,400
It's a personal ship, is not it?

623
00:46:31,577 --> 00:46:33,068
You will be safe there.

624
00:46:33,276 --> 00:46:35,889
Any order before landing?
- Stay hidden.

625
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,377
You carry a part of me inside.

626
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,955
- Captain...
- Come on.

627
00:46:57,955 --> 00:46:59,462
We're wasting time.

628
00:47:15,172 --> 00:47:17,139
We are approaching the place.

629
00:47:17,628 --> 00:47:20,454
- You're good?
- Yes

630
00:47:27,976 --> 00:47:29,908
There are no places to fish.

631
00:47:30,136 --> 00:47:32,091
Find a place to land Blue.
- Scanning.

632
00:47:32,455 --> 00:47:35,032
You're a nuisance miss.
- How important was it for them?

633
00:47:35,223 --> 00:47:36,709
For the Konstrukts?

634
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:40,233
They had you in a museum.

635
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:43,042
You were unconscious and
You were alone for thousands of years.

636
00:47:44,755 --> 00:47:46,469
You did not have anyone to talk to.

637
00:47:46,668 --> 00:47:47,964
You were alone.

638
00:47:48,231 --> 00:47:49,491
You could not move.

639
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,886
He was who he was.
- You were not like that, Blue.

640
00:47:54,091 --> 00:47:57,842
And you're not shit,
You are unique, special.

641
00:47:59,727 --> 00:48:01,261
You know it, do not you?

642
00:48:01,515 --> 00:48:03,507
I know, and you?

643
00:48:06,182 --> 00:48:07,549
Hold on tight.

644
00:48:28,942 --> 00:48:31,428
- They landed?
- It looks like it is.

645
00:48:32,337 --> 00:48:33,723
That's not good.

646
00:48:42,773 --> 00:48:44,176
There are many.

647
00:48:44,974 --> 00:48:46,356
Are we going to land soon?

648
00:48:47,107 --> 00:48:48,762
I can not stay here.

649
00:48:49,037 --> 00:48:50,585
Why did you become a breeder?

650
00:48:50,807 --> 00:48:52,477
I could not get a
work in the nucleus.

651
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,861
And I wanted to leave my house.

652
00:48:54,089 --> 00:48:55,585
For how many babies did you sign?

653
00:48:55,804 --> 00:48:58,973
It can reach up to 10
but I signed for 5.

654
00:48:59,382 --> 00:49:01,806
The pay was almost the same.

655
00:49:02,381 --> 00:49:03,695
Maybe I enjoy it,

656
00:49:03,933 --> 00:49:05,415
but now...

657
00:49:05,687 --> 00:49:07,835
You are about to be pregnant.

658
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:11,920
- I've never been with a man before.
- Y?

659
00:49:14,677 --> 00:49:18,173
He is not...
that's not what I expected.

660
00:49:18,374 --> 00:49:22,601
Here I have sample of
the best men.

661
00:49:23,103 --> 00:49:25,234
And Derasi is ...
- Common?

662
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:28,930
Well not yet.

663
00:49:32,377 --> 00:49:33,809
You like it right?

664
00:49:34,203 --> 00:49:35,613
Curse!

665
00:49:40,432 --> 00:49:42,000
My husband...

666
00:49:42,235 --> 00:49:45,271
He died a short time ago
and I'm recovering.

667
00:49:45,477 --> 00:49:46,995
Can we land now?

668
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:49,249
Listen to my story
- Your history?

669
00:49:50,035 --> 00:49:51,450
It is funny.

670
00:49:53,269 --> 00:49:54,886
What do you want from life?

671
00:49:55,164 --> 00:49:57,493
I want to be with a man
that loves me ...

672
00:49:58,026 --> 00:49:59,354
and have a family.

673
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,765
Que?
- Curse!

674
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:03,566
You should not have said that.

675
00:50:03,787 --> 00:50:05,396
I can say what I want.

676
00:50:05,666 --> 00:50:08,458
You have to...
- What are you talking about Alicia ?!

677
00:50:11,278 --> 00:50:12,401
You are...

678
00:50:13,702 --> 00:50:15,519
You are a damn robot.

679
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:17,355
What?!

680
00:50:19,298 --> 00:50:20,519
You are a model of pleasure.

681
00:50:21,326 --> 00:50:24,289
Your ex-husband reprogrammed you for
that you thought you were human

682
00:50:27,171 --> 00:50:29,261
No, I'm sure I'm human.

683
00:50:29,497 --> 00:50:32,150
Everyone on the ship knows
that you are a robot ...

684
00:50:32,422 --> 00:50:33,441
except you.

685
00:50:33,841 --> 00:50:35,476
You just think you're human.

686
00:50:38,739 --> 00:50:40,131
You can not have children

687
00:50:40,446 --> 00:50:41,990
If I can.

688
00:50:42,436 --> 00:50:45,517
I have my periods,
I bleed and I have pains.

689
00:50:45,823 --> 00:50:47,317
I have cramps.

690
00:50:47,716 --> 00:50:49,473
A bio-robot.

691
00:50:49,953 --> 00:50:52,133
Designed to imitate humans
in every sense.

692
00:50:52,419 --> 00:50:53,649
That is the point.

693
00:50:58,171 --> 00:50:59,704
Derasi told me.

694
00:51:01,692 --> 00:51:04,149
That's why he does not want anything with you.

695
00:51:12,582 --> 00:51:14,931
But I...

696
00:51:23,403 --> 00:51:25,627
- Where is the military depot?
-20 miles to the east.

697
00:51:25,837 --> 00:51:26,872
How is the air?

698
00:51:27,154 --> 00:51:28,728
Something changed with
respect years ...

699
00:51:28,729 --> 00:51:30,306
... previous but what
you will find little dense

700
00:51:30,584 --> 00:51:32,347
This was a good gift.

701
00:51:32,601 --> 00:51:34,396
- Be carefull with that.
- Yes mom.

702
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:36,480
Derasi?
- What?!

703
00:51:37,383 --> 00:51:39,020
Come back soon.

704
00:51:50,401 --> 00:51:53,756
In Pleiades there were beaches
everywhere.

705
00:51:55,082 --> 00:51:56,958
There is not much land.

706
00:51:58,229 --> 00:51:59,667
Shallow waters.

707
00:52:00,582 --> 00:52:02,428
Open spaces.

708
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:04,560
The water scares me.

709
00:52:10,247 --> 00:52:12,930
Do you love me Mr. Twinkle?

710
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:20,295
That was the last one.

711
00:52:20,889 --> 00:52:24,858
Mr. Twinkle has five
of our best minds.

712
00:52:31,617 --> 00:52:33,208
Do you want to be in love?

713
00:52:41,355 --> 00:52:43,444
Maybe it's programmed that way.

714
00:52:45,993 --> 00:52:48,416
My emotions do not exist.

715
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:57,087
Why did he make me ... feel?

716
00:52:58,333 --> 00:53:01,826
Why did he make me love things?

717
00:53:04,003 --> 00:53:05,355
Why?

718
00:53:07,921 --> 00:53:09,997
Why?

719
00:53:13,188 --> 00:53:15,738
I want...

720
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:26,584
What is that?

721
00:53:29,783 --> 00:53:31,855
- Return with the weapons.
- I will do what i can.

722
00:53:35,374 --> 00:53:37,032
I love this.

723
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,260
They're here.

724
00:53:48,478 --> 00:53:49,996
- Can you see us?
- Of course.

725
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:54,722
They are not going to stop.

726
00:53:55,305 --> 00:53:56,692
Why do they do this?

727
00:53:57,052 --> 00:53:58,580
Damn Nephilim.

728
00:54:13,813 --> 00:54:15,599
Are they going to hit us from behind?

729
00:54:16,227 --> 00:54:18,211
They have more important goals.

730
00:54:28,421 --> 00:54:32,044
Hello son.
- I'm not your son.

731
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,881
387.
- It was.

732
00:54:47,568 --> 00:54:49,270
You are still a slave.

733
00:54:50,541 --> 00:54:52,850
What generation?
- G-7.

734
00:54:53,105 --> 00:54:56,131
Three hearts, bio-plasma skin,

735
00:54:56,327 --> 00:54:59,608
double layer of Creniun.

736
00:55:00,218 --> 00:55:02,617
- Do you know him?
- The genetics program.

737
00:55:05,651 --> 00:55:08,536
We were in all the colonies.

738
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,168
I had three masters for
When I was 12 years old.

739
00:55:12,545 --> 00:55:15,397
Until the captain bought me.

740
00:55:16,444 --> 00:55:19,024
And one day the captain released me.

741
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,993
He made me his second.

742
00:55:25,305 --> 00:55:27,025
I've paid.

743
00:55:29,126 --> 00:55:31,028
Who is the first of you?

744
00:55:35,481 --> 00:55:38,158
Some time ago we know
of his illegal colony.

745
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:42,333
If they had stolen ships ...

746
00:55:42,744 --> 00:55:44,812
we would have occupied them.

747
00:55:47,675 --> 00:55:49,840
I have done things of which
I regret.

748
00:55:53,121 --> 00:55:55,287
The captain deserved a lot of this.

749
00:56:00,739 --> 00:56:03,396
I read "The prohibited saga
of humanity. "

750
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:06,100
It is punished with my death.

751
00:56:06,421 --> 00:56:11,285
The humans and the Konstrukts were
once the same spice on Earth.

752
00:56:11,661 --> 00:56:14,241
It was a human doctor, Hatcher,

753
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:18,187
he had the dream of seeing
evolve to Homo-sapiens.

754
00:56:19,433 --> 00:56:21,500
They programmed me so that
I would worry about those things.

755
00:56:22,389 --> 00:56:28,201
Nephilim hoped there would be less
humans before the genocide began.

756
00:56:29,227 --> 00:56:32,132
I have doubts as to whether
they will keep their promises ...

757
00:56:32,331 --> 00:56:34,622
about sharing immortality.

758
00:56:35,687 --> 00:56:37,406
Do you think they will turn against you?

759
00:56:40,831 --> 00:56:43,756
I want to kill the Nephilim
that is on board,

760
00:56:44,055 --> 00:56:46,351
and look for another way.

761
00:57:21,509 --> 00:57:23,830
It's better than I thought.

762
00:57:47,954 --> 00:57:50,371
Yes.

763
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,196
What do we do?

764
00:57:55,041 --> 00:57:56,514
Restart the engines.

765
00:57:57,531 --> 00:57:57,879
How?

766
00:57:59,494 --> 00:58:01,670
I will do it manually.

767
00:58:01,868 --> 00:58:03,560
We will go more slowly, but
We have to try.

768
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:16,378
I have a surprise for you, Blue.
- Derasi!

769
00:58:18,601 --> 00:58:19,667
Go back, lady.

770
00:58:19,856 --> 00:58:21,419
- I'm a fucking robot!
- What?!

771
00:58:21,621 --> 00:58:22,912
I'm sorry...

772
00:58:23,187 --> 00:58:25,895
You knew all the time
And you did not tell me anything!

773
00:58:26,776 --> 00:58:28,485
It's okay, you're just a robot.

774
00:58:28,687 --> 00:58:29,934
Let it go!

775
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:31,755
At least I have a body.

776
00:58:32,016 --> 00:58:34,138
If I kill you with the force of a robot,

777
00:58:34,556 --> 00:58:37,708
it would not be murder
because I do not have a soul

778
00:58:37,936 --> 00:58:40,779
You were happy and
I needed you on the ship ...

779
00:58:40,993 --> 00:58:43,321
so...
- Fuck you!

780
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:47,513
- I had fantasies with you!
- Really?

781
00:58:47,804 --> 00:58:50,305
To have a child with you and everything.

782
00:58:51,171 --> 00:58:54,425
What happened to that?
- Why did you not tell me?! Why?

783
00:58:54,642 --> 00:58:56,592
Markus asked me not to tell you.

784
00:59:00,129 --> 00:59:02,532
I wanted to be with you!
Everyone wanted to be with you!

785
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:05,896
Markus was your husband.
If I slept with you ...

786
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:08,269
You would like to be pregnant and then ...
- And after that?

787
00:59:08,701 --> 00:59:10,603
You would not have made the robot happy!

788
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,175
May God save me from doing
happy to a robot.

789
00:59:13,414 --> 00:59:15,528
You already pregnant your reproductive!

790
00:59:16,155 --> 00:59:19,883
That was before she ...

791
00:59:23,274 --> 00:59:25,683
There is another ship on the way.

792
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:28,338
We have enough weapons so ...

793
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:30,940
You will need more than that.

794
00:59:32,074 --> 00:59:33,844
Fix me the ship.

795
00:59:36,227 --> 00:59:37,926
Por favor.
- That's an order?

796
00:59:38,798 --> 00:59:39,503
Yes.

797
00:59:39,751 --> 00:59:42,083
If I do not do it
we all die, right?

798
00:59:42,281 --> 00:59:43,405
Yes, that is the plan.

799
00:59:43,662 --> 00:59:45,214
Why should I care ?!

800
00:59:45,446 --> 00:59:47,901
I'm just a machine without feelings!

801
00:59:48,152 --> 00:59:49,800
Trust me, you have feelings.

802
00:59:50,009 --> 00:59:51,277
They're here.

803
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:06,085
If you had put me an engine
again we would not have this problem.

804
01:00:06,418 --> 01:00:08,867
- Did you know I'm a robot?
- Everybody knows.

805
01:00:09,837 --> 01:00:11,380
You could have told me.

806
01:00:11,623 --> 01:00:13,951
If it were you I would have noticed.

807
01:00:14,393 --> 01:00:17,275
This is your heart and your soul
I can finish you.

808
01:00:17,631 --> 01:00:19,363
I slip something and ...

809
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:22,287
You can do that, but
You will live with guilt.

810
01:00:22,893 --> 01:00:24,366
Do you think your feelings
are real?

811
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:26,165
Of course yes.

812
01:00:26,465 --> 01:00:28,442
We are not very different
to the humans.

813
01:00:28,683 --> 01:00:30,954
You have your DNA and you
biological programming.

814
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,678
You excel in mind
and you have a body.

815
01:00:35,109 --> 01:00:36,992
You can do things with your feelings.

816
01:01:25,464 --> 01:01:27,298
Target the target.
Do not shoot like crazy.

817
01:01:27,546 --> 01:01:30,242
I already killed three.
- You can not fail!

818
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,032
You will see!

819
01:01:47,118 --> 01:01:48,702
Very impressive.

820
01:01:54,807 --> 01:01:57,596
I will finish with these
You fucking sons of bitches.

821
01:01:57,854 --> 01:02:00,957
- Leave them!
- Come on.

822
01:02:01,012 --> 01:02:02,625
I want to do this!

823
01:02:02,817 --> 01:02:04,479
They have to pay!

824
01:02:04,686 --> 01:02:06,433
What a pity you do not show
this in bed.

825
01:02:38,794 --> 01:02:40,243
Close the door!

826
01:02:40,565 --> 01:02:42,953
There is no energy Derasi.
Contessa is working.

827
01:02:45,998 --> 01:02:47,208
Give me a gun!

828
01:02:51,453 --> 01:02:53,886
- How long?
- A few minutes for the restart.

829
01:02:54,267 --> 01:02:57,460
I can not promise you that
just minutes

830
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,683
Can you load a couple of missiles?

831
01:03:06,743 --> 01:03:08,952
I do it
- Back off.

832
01:03:09,518 --> 01:03:12,855
Take Alice to the cave.
It is 20 miles to the east.

833
01:03:13,741 --> 01:03:16,176
That way you'll be safe.
There will be a few explosions.

834
01:03:30,005 --> 01:03:32,371
- Come on, move!
- I need a few minutes.

835
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:43,387
- They keep coming.
- Empty.

836
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:46,273
Close the doors!

837
01:04:28,001 --> 01:04:31,024
Come on, Blue!
- I do not have energy!

838
01:04:34,087 --> 01:04:41,137
You, humans, took us away
of our immortality.

839
01:04:43,002 --> 01:04:46,991
Your species must die.

840
01:04:50,055 --> 01:04:52,333
You guys are ugly.

841
01:04:55,326 --> 01:04:57,686
I'm sorry, Derasi,
I do everything I can.

842
01:05:09,290 --> 01:05:10,860
Stay here and you will be safe.

843
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:14,721
- I am safe.
- I'm not a robot.

844
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:21,216
It's okay.

845
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:34,545
They are in my central core!
What I do?!

846
01:05:35,102 --> 01:05:36,479
Stop them!

847
01:05:41,402 --> 01:05:43,128
Derasi I ...

848
01:05:43,772 --> 01:05:45,251
Blue?

849
01:05:48,463 --> 01:05:50,868
Talk to me Blue!

850
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:31,902
I will be on the bridge.

851
01:08:38,125 --> 01:08:39,606
Get off the ship.

852
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:45,360
Do you want to die now?

853
01:08:49,756 --> 01:08:52,721
You are a race of cowards.

854
01:08:54,089 --> 01:08:57,787
Many Konstrukts are alive
for my cowardice.

855
01:08:57,788 --> 01:09:03,444
But there were mejroes
ways of doing it

856
01:09:03,523 --> 01:09:06,127
I want to see them dead as much as you.

857
01:09:24,435 --> 01:09:26,912
The strategy of catching the fish.

858
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:33,988
It's not just patience, it's the strategy
against the fish. And then catch him.

859
01:09:33,989 --> 01:09:34,989
First you have to
attract him to the hook.

860
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,333
Then make sure
of having caught him.

861
01:09:43,611 --> 01:09:48,231
You have to make sure of that
before taking it out.

862
01:09:50,598 --> 01:09:51,992
Remember that.

863
01:09:53,235 --> 01:09:54,799
So shall.

864
01:10:10,633 --> 01:10:12,256
I'm too young to have a baby.

865
01:10:12,842 --> 01:10:14,628
I also.

866
01:10:21,101 --> 01:10:24,735
Your ship is in good hands.
- Yes cool!

867
01:10:30,356 --> 01:10:33,618
- Is Blue okay?
- I'm sorry, captain.

868
01:10:34,645 --> 01:10:36,125
The central core is fine ...

869
01:10:36,296 --> 01:10:38,339
but we could not connect it to the ship.

870
01:10:46,890 --> 01:10:48,907
Contessa says ...
- What did you find in the cave?

871
01:10:49,165 --> 01:10:51,313
We found a missile deposit.

872
01:10:51,507 --> 01:10:53,607
It's out there, dealing with
the rest of the Nephilim.

873
01:10:54,874 --> 01:10:56,889
She has a big heart.

874
01:11:39,419 --> 01:11:43,562
Objective at 28-7.
Load. Fire.

875
01:11:49,988 --> 01:11:51,702
It would be better if you come back.

876
01:12:13,374 --> 01:12:16,758
I wish I had ... you know ...

877
01:12:19,656 --> 01:12:21,334
I would have liked...

878
01:12:23,517 --> 01:12:25,557
It hurts.

879
01:12:28,848 --> 01:12:31,852
Hopefully...

880
01:12:37,376 --> 01:12:38,809
Blue?

881
01:12:42,874 --> 01:12:44,957
It is trapped in the glass.

882
01:12:48,158 --> 01:12:50,728
Your conscience is still alive.

883
01:12:51,109 --> 01:12:53,656
Find the way to ...

884
01:13:46,357 --> 01:13:48,165
With the loss of your fleet,

885
01:13:48,378 --> 01:13:51,146
the Nephilim Empire was left without control.

886
01:13:51,483 --> 01:13:54,861
The progeny of Homo sapiens
continued for years.

887
01:14:16,431 --> 01:14:20,935
A geneticist Konstrukt, used the collection
of ovaries from Alice for ...

888
01:14:21,151 --> 01:14:22,564
make a clone of Sheetak.

889
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:25,459
We thought it would be good
for Blue's conscience.

890
01:14:26,184 --> 01:14:28,336
Derasi would be pleased.

891
01:15:00,955 --> 01:15:04,303
We travel two galaxies before
that we found a new home.

892
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:07,189
8 births for the new humanity.

893
01:15:28,016 --> 01:15:29,860
- Where do I update?
- There and there.

894
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:32,243
Explain to me because I have to do it.

895
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:43,826
- You have to touch these three ...
- Do not touch.

896
01:15:45,946 --> 01:15:47,743
Alicia discovered her true calling,

897
01:15:47,959 --> 01:15:50,888
after giving birth to 5 children
to take care of them

898
01:15:51,548 --> 01:15:53,670
She never returned to our world.

899
01:15:53,907 --> 01:15:56,801
But I always assumed that it helped
to overthrow the Nephilim Empire ...

900
01:15:57,453 --> 01:16:00,583
because in a few decades
they were all dead.

901
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:13,051
The sperm sample that Alicia had
He gave me a beautiful son.

902
01:16:13,488 --> 01:16:15,835
She never told me the identity
of the donor.

903
01:16:16,122 --> 01:16:18,178
But I know it was Derasi.

904
01:16:19,694 --> 01:16:21,631
Our home has changed.

905
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:23,721
And fishing is our way
of survive.

906
01:16:24,175 --> 01:16:25,566
We are happy here.

907
01:16:25,795 --> 01:16:27,793
A part of me misses Derasi.

908
01:16:28,134 --> 01:16:31,253
He made many mistakes,
but he was a man ...

909
01:16:31,556 --> 01:16:33,750
and lived as a man should live.

910
01:16:38,268 --> 01:16:41,211
I hope my son grows
and do not look like his father.

911
01:16:41,634 --> 01:16:44,663
But sometimes I wait
that is equal to him.

912
01:16:49,764 --> 01:16:53,469
I have become alive,
the creator of worlds.

913
01:16:54,023 --> 01:16:57,592
I am a machine and I have a soul.
