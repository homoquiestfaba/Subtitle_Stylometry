2
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:02,195
50 years ago, an alien force known
as the Formics attacked Earth.

3
00:01:02,507 --> 00:01:04,293
10 millions died.

4
00:01:06,013 --> 00:01:08,303
It was only through the sacrifice of our greatest commander

5
00:01:08,303 --> 00:01:11,549
that we avoided total annihilation.

6
00:01:25,157 --> 00:01:29,489
We've been preparing for them to come back,
ever since.

7
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,240
The International Fleet decided

8
00:01:31,443 --> 00:01:34,689
that the world's smartest children
are the planet's best hope.

9
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:41,297
Raised on war-games, their decisions
are intuitive, decisive, fearless.

10
00:01:41,398 --> 00:01:44,748
I am one of those recruits.

11
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,679
I've watched through his eyes,

12
00:01:47,705 --> 00:01:50,256
I've listened through his ears

13
00:01:51,256 --> 00:01:54,782
and I tell you, he's THE ONE!

14
00:01:54,783 --> 00:01:57,400
That's what you said about his brother.

15
00:01:57,609 --> 00:02:00,041
Brother tested out impossible for other reasons

16
00:02:00,042 --> 00:02:03,043
... nothing to do with his tactical abilities.

17
00:02:03,393 --> 00:02:05,871
- I gotcha! I gotcha!
- Try there... go back!

18
00:02:06,116 --> 00:02:09,047
He's gonna crush 'em.

19
00:02:10,828 --> 00:02:13,063
God!!

20
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,878
- You can't do that.
- You've got to use what is around you.

21
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,798
No no,
I had you all the way through the belt!

22
00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:21,011
You might have calculated your trajectory
wrong due to the incoming asteroids.

23
00:02:21,012 --> 00:02:23,450
Don't.. lecture me. Wiggin.
You cheated!

24
00:02:25,073 --> 00:02:27,377
It was a good game...

25
00:02:28,109 --> 00:02:30,029
Thanks.

26
00:02:32,561 --> 00:02:34,273
HEY!

27
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:40,723
Play again!

28
00:02:40,924 --> 00:02:41,698
Sorry.

29
00:02:41,924 --> 00:02:44,215
Tomorrow, maybe?

30
00:02:44,215 --> 00:02:47,191
You see, he's got a talent for strategy.

31
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:49,182
His humility could be false,

32
00:02:49,183 --> 00:02:53,407
part of a strategy to avoid antagonizing 
an ego-driven opponent.

33
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:55,256
Which makes him even smarter.

34
00:02:55,256 --> 00:02:57,073
He may be a genius but we need someone

35
00:02:57,074 --> 00:02:59,966
the others will follow . A leader.
He can't win on his own.

36
00:03:00,036 --> 00:03:03,127
Well, let's see how he handles rejection.

37
00:03:04,137 --> 00:03:10,154
Andrew Wiggin! Andrew... Ender Wiggin...
Please report to the infirmary!

38
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,946
Ender Wiggin to the infirmary.

39
00:03:20,697 --> 00:03:22,930
- Hello Ender!
- Hello!

40
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:24,909
That nasty monitor is coming out today.

41
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,168
Please, lie face down.

42
00:03:27,691 --> 00:03:30,309
Am I off the program?

43
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,602
- Did I do something wrong?
- That's not really for me to say.

44
00:03:42,897 --> 00:03:44,433
Lie down.

45
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:47,603
The sooner we get this done,
the sooner you can move on.

46
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:00,874
Ready?

47
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,692
This won't hurt a bit.

48
00:04:35,855 --> 00:04:39,101
Where do you think you're going, Wiggin?

49
00:04:39,323 --> 00:04:41,382
Washed out, huh?

50
00:04:41,383 --> 00:04:45,547
- Come on!
<i>- Come on! Get him in there!</i>

51
00:04:51,507 --> 00:04:55,172
Come on, chief... one on one,
for real this time.

52
00:04:55,173 --> 00:04:58,976
- No games.
- He's got no monitor now.
- That's right.

53
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:01,979
No one wants you now, Wiggin.

54
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:08,193
One-on-one,
then why are your boys holding me?

55
00:05:08,554 --> 00:05:10,023
Let's go!

56
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:12,048
Come on, man!

57
00:05:23,496 --> 00:05:26,662
- Stay down.
- I'm gonna kill you, chief (???)

58
00:05:29,443 --> 00:05:31,317
Take it easy, Ender.

59
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:40,543
You might be thinking of 
ganging up on me...

60
00:05:40,543 --> 00:05:43,884
But just remember what I do to people
who try to hurt me.

61
00:05:57,626 --> 00:05:59,755
He said I was cheating...

62
00:05:59,755 --> 00:06:03,315
he said that was why I was off the program.
And I kept on kicking him...

63
00:06:03,316 --> 00:06:05,968
- Doesn't matter.
- ...even after he was down.

64
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:09,843
- He will never bully you again.
- All I could think was...

65
00:06:09,844 --> 00:06:12,880
...what would Peter do?

66
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:18,815
- I'm just like him, now.
- No. No, you're nothing like him Ender.

67
00:06:18,816 --> 00:06:20,410
Nothing like whom?

68
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,028
- I thought you had a game.
- Rained out...

69
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:25,251
- What's he crying about?
- I'm not crying!

70
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:28,847
My monitor's gone. Now I'm just like you.

71
00:06:28,882 --> 00:06:32,720
You mean Mom & Dad spent all that money on a Third
and now he's off the program, too?

72
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:35,338
Stop it, Peter. He made it farther than either of us.

73
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:39,088
Hey, drop out!
Remember how to play formics and astronauts?

74
00:06:39,088 --> 00:06:42,344
- That's it. Where is mom?
- No. Don't.

75
00:06:42,345 --> 00:06:47,338
- I'll play.
- Put the mask on... you can be the bug.

76
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,190
<i>- Peter, you're sick!</i>
- Stay out of this, Valentine.
<i>- No. Stop it.</i>

77
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:57,530
- Okay bug. You started it. You attack first.
<i>- Let me in.</i>
- Come on...

78
00:06:59,347 --> 00:07:04,245
- Come on, fight back. At last, we've got one of you alive.
<i>- Peter, stop!</i>

79
00:07:04,246 --> 00:07:08,226
You know, I could kill you just like this.

80
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,671
- Please!
- I should've been chosen!

81
00:07:24,446 --> 00:07:28,887
Deep Space intel shows us that the
number of enemy ships already

82
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:33,366
deployed is 10 times those
we faced during the first invasion.

83
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:38,781
The Formics are rebuilding and strengthening
their fleet. We must conquer or die.

84
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:40,246
Turn it off please, John.

85
00:07:40,247 --> 00:07:42,376
Why? You'd rather not know
what's going on in the world?

86
00:07:42,376 --> 00:07:48,604
We must never again bear witness
to the slaughter of tens of millions of innocent people
as we did during the Formic invasion.

87
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:50,278
I'd rather you talk to your son.

88
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:55,390
Our survival demands total commitment
to the destruction of the enemy...

89
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:58,706
If you want, I'll go away.
So you don't have to be embarrassed.

90
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:01,778
Ender, no one is embarrassed.

91
00:08:02,206 --> 00:08:05,627
I am a Third.
I should never have been born.

92
00:08:05,628 --> 00:08:07,912
No. We wanted you, Ender.
We just needed permission.

93
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:16,753
John, please say something.

94
00:08:18,393 --> 00:08:20,697
It's a tough program, Ender.

95
00:08:22,303 --> 00:08:27,028
When they brought me to this country,
there was less competition and still I didn't make it.

96
00:08:27,376 --> 00:08:30,553
You have nothing to be ashamed of...

97
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,322
...nothing.

98
00:08:33,683 --> 00:08:37,662
<i>#Sensor alert! Front door...
Please state your name.#</i>

99
00:08:37,663 --> 00:08:45,482
Colonel Hyrum Graff, Director of Training, International Fleet.
This is my colleague, Major Anderson. May we?

100
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,159
Why'd you keep kicking him?
You had already won the fight.

101
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,568
- Did you enjoy it?
- No.

102
00:08:50,568 --> 00:08:53,781
Then why? Speak up, son.

103
00:08:55,805 --> 00:09:00,308
Knocking him down was the first fight.

104
00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:03,216
I wanted to win all the next ones, too.

105
00:09:03,217 --> 00:09:04,927
So they'd leave me alone.

106
00:09:04,928 --> 00:09:07,196
Don't you think you should have
asked a grown up for help?

107
00:09:07,197 --> 00:09:12,712
Nonsense! He can fight his own battles.
Colonel, he was obviously being bullied and he defended himself.

108
00:09:12,713 --> 00:09:14,528
Son...

109
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:19,484
I'd like to offer you a place in our program.

110
00:09:24,849 --> 00:09:26,630
But you took away my monitor.

111
00:09:26,664 --> 00:09:31,586
The final step in our evaluation is always to
see what happens when the monitor is removed.

112
00:09:31,587 --> 00:09:35,251
And he passed?
He put a child in the hospital.

113
00:09:35,252 --> 00:09:40,862
It's not what he did, it's why he did it.
It was tactical, a strategy to stop future attacks.

114
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,620
Andrew, you don't have to do this.

115
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:46,831
Ender and I should have
a private conversation.

116
00:09:46,832 --> 00:09:53,535
- Absolutely not.
- With all respect sir, you really can't stop me.

117
00:09:55,174 --> 00:09:58,222
Formics might have wiped us
out the last time, you know.

118
00:10:00,411 --> 00:10:04,983
A brilliant commander is the
only thing that saved us.

119
00:10:04,983 --> 00:10:07,043
Mazer Rackham?

120
00:10:07,463 --> 00:10:11,710
Mazer Rackham!
We need minds like yours, Ender.

121
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:16,470
Young people integrate complex data more easily than adults.

122
00:10:18,158 --> 00:10:20,496
Will the monitor be reinstalled?

123
00:10:20,497 --> 00:10:21,927
No.

124
00:10:21,928 --> 00:10:24,406
You graduated.

125
00:10:24,406 --> 00:10:27,477
To Battle School.

126
00:10:27,477 --> 00:10:31,875
Privacy rights are restored.

127
00:10:31,946 --> 00:10:40,464
If there's a chance, because of you, the Formics
might leave us alone forever...

128
00:10:40,778 --> 00:10:45,398
then I have to ask you to come with me.

129
00:10:49,447 --> 00:10:52,590
It's what I was born for, right?

130
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,352
Valentine was too compassionate for Battle School.

131
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,671
My brother Peter washed out
because he was too quick to violence.

132
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:15,643
Colonel Graff said I needed to find a balance
between those emotions if I were to succeed.

133
00:11:22,867 --> 00:11:24,612
Join the others.

134
00:11:25,521 --> 00:11:27,231
Go on!

135
00:11:42,162 --> 00:11:45,582
- You're late!
- Out of my control.

136
00:11:45,582 --> 00:11:47,573
I'm Ender.

137
00:11:47,992 --> 00:11:52,495
Ender?
What kind of name is that?

138
00:11:52,496 --> 00:11:55,078
What's your name?

139
00:11:55,846 --> 00:11:57,066
Name is Bean.

140
00:11:57,067 --> 00:12:02,094
- Bean?
- Grew up on the streets, not with a bean. (???)

141
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:56,554
- I'm gonna be...
- Bag! Give him the bag!

142
00:13:07,598 --> 00:13:09,797
Close the bag!

143
00:13:12,764 --> 00:13:14,929
- You alright?
- Yeah.

144
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:19,535
What're you doing, Wiggin?

145
00:13:19,536 --> 00:13:22,608
- Nothing, sir.
- Something funny?

146
00:13:23,341 --> 00:13:25,924
I asked you a question, launchy.

147
00:13:26,797 --> 00:13:31,997
Sir, the way you're floating. Horizontally.
I thought that was funny.

148
00:13:31,998 --> 00:13:33,046
Really, why?

149
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:36,770
Because in zero gravity, there is no right side up.

150
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:40,354
You may think you're vertical and we may be horizontal.

151
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:43,321
- Is that funny?
- Sir, no sir!

152
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,590
Yes, it is.

153
00:13:46,115 --> 00:13:49,151
Alai, you know what he is talking about?

154
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:51,630
- Yes, sir.
- No, you don't.

155
00:13:52,013 --> 00:13:57,039
There's only one kid on this launch
with any brains at all so far...

156
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,131
...and that's Ender Wiggin.

157
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:41,990
<i>#All new arrivals follow the yellow lights
to your accommodation. The yellow lights.#</i>

158
00:14:48,415 --> 00:14:53,415
<i>#All new arrivals follow the yellow lights
to your accommodation. The yellow lights.#</i>

159
00:14:53,956 --> 00:14:55,596
So you made them hate me.

160
00:14:55,596 --> 00:14:57,655
I told them you were the best.

161
00:14:57,656 --> 00:15:00,343
We need a Julius Caesar, a Napoleon.

162
00:15:00,344 --> 00:15:01,669
We hope that would be you.

163
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:06,349
- Caesar was assassinated by the people he trusted.
- Napoleon lost in the end.

164
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:10,154
Not before he conquered the known world.

165
00:15:11,376 --> 00:15:13,238
- Dismissed.
- Yes, sir.

166
00:15:18,148 --> 00:15:21,079
He has a complicated response to authority.

167
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:26,070
He wants to please the overbearing father figure
but resents the lack of reciprocated affection.

168
00:15:26,071 --> 00:15:27,864
His isolation can never be broken

169
00:15:27,865 --> 00:15:31,809
and he must never believe anyone will help him.

170
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:34,684
Oh look. It's the smartass.

171
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:44,832
Thanks!
Thought I'd have to ask to be by the door.

172
00:15:52,522 --> 00:15:57,339
<i>#State your name.#</i>
- Ender Wiggin.

173
00:16:01,732 --> 00:16:06,852
- Don't freeze your balls, kid.
- Attention on deck.

174
00:16:07,371 --> 00:16:08,942
At ease.

175
00:16:09,222 --> 00:16:11,524
Listen up, Launchies!

176
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:20,915
My name is Sergeant James Dap. Ask me a
legitimate question and I will give you a direct answer..

177
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:25,384
but if you are looking for a shoulder
to cry on, use your pillow.

178
00:16:26,046 --> 00:16:30,410
- Do I look like I'm joking, snots?
- Sir! No, sir!

179
00:16:30,411 --> 00:16:33,901
Good.
You are to work as a team..

180
00:16:33,902 --> 00:16:38,823
You will all make this bunkroom, your home.
You will keep your home clean.

181
00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:40,906
There are separate showers for both sexes.

182
00:16:40,907 --> 00:16:44,850
If you are found in an area not designated to your gender,

183
00:16:44,851 --> 00:16:49,728
I will personally neuter you.
- Am I clear?
- Sir! Yes sir!

184
00:16:54,567 --> 00:17:01,271
- Class is in five. Follow the yellow lights.
  Yellow like your cowardly selves.
- Sir! Yes, sir!

185
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:03,703
Welcome to Battle School.

186
00:17:03,704 --> 00:17:06,868
A great responsibility rests on each of you.

187
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:09,870
When the enemy first invaded, we were not ready.

188
00:17:09,871 --> 00:17:12,907
Millions of innocent lives were lost.

189
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:16,188
That must never be allowed to happen again.

190
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:21,333
We threw everything we had at the invaders.
And in the midst of that decisive battle,

191
00:17:22,915 --> 00:17:25,837
a legendary hero emerged.

192
00:18:20,272 --> 00:18:23,447
We will never forget what the enemy did

193
00:18:23,448 --> 00:18:25,576
but we defeated them.

194
00:18:25,577 --> 00:18:29,174
and we will do so again.

195
00:18:29,628 --> 00:18:35,876
Let the courage of Mazer Rackham
be your inspiration.

196
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:38,913
Wakey wakey.
Rise and shine.

197
00:18:38,914 --> 00:18:40,658
Put on your Battle Room suits

198
00:18:40,658 --> 00:18:44,148
That's the padded one with the helmet and the weapon.

199
00:18:44,149 --> 00:18:46,977
Do not attempt to fire the weapon.

200
00:18:46,977 --> 00:18:53,260
Holster it! Let's move it launchies, you've got 10 minutes!

201
00:19:00,966 --> 00:19:03,269
At ease!

202
00:19:03,374 --> 00:19:04,805
This is the Battle Room.

203
00:19:04,805 --> 00:19:10,040
In here, the floor's been designed
to create an Earth-like gravitational pull.

204
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:15,313
Step through that gate
and you are in a zero-G environment.

205
00:19:21,249 --> 00:19:24,559
Wiggin!
Get up here.

206
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:58,137
- What do I do now, sir?
- Go on in.

207
00:20:15,497 --> 00:20:19,547
Alright now, push off.

208
00:21:14,797 --> 00:21:16,065
Nicely done.

209
00:21:16,065 --> 00:21:19,126
These guys are still trying to
stay up the way they came in.

210
00:21:19,126 --> 00:21:22,546
But like you said in the shuttle,
there is no up or down in space.

211
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:25,550
But we'll need some way
to orientate in here...

212
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,132
...maybe the enemy's gate is down?

213
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:35,254
- I get it, like they're a bug to be
crushed under our feet.
- Exactly.

214
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:42,668
- What do you think this does?
- Let's find out.

215
00:21:51,927 --> 00:21:54,396
Whoa! Won't acts harmless... (???)

216
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:59,774
- What do you think it does when it hits the suit?
- Good question.

217
00:22:05,999 --> 00:22:10,839
- Shoot me in the leg.
- We shoot each other. Same time.

218
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:13,227
Ready?

219
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:24,513
- Whoa! My leg's frozen!
- Mine too.

220
00:22:24,861 --> 00:22:26,678
I can't bend my knee...

221
00:22:29,924 --> 00:22:35,299
Shoot me in the chest...
Come on! I'm getting away.

222
00:22:40,535 --> 00:22:46,888
- This is amazing...
  I can't move at all now.
- Out of his mind.

223
00:22:46,889 --> 00:22:48,843
That's enough.

224
00:23:03,587 --> 00:23:06,612
You're flapping around like
a bunch of drunken ducks.

225
00:23:06,638 --> 00:23:10,254
If you expect to compete with the
other teams in this School...

226
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:15,178
... you've got a lot to learn.
Sergeant, explain the game!
- Yes Sir!

227
00:23:16,423 --> 00:23:20,820
You will train to compete as a team
against other teams.

228
00:23:20,821 --> 00:23:24,268
You get 1 point for a hit to a limb, 
six for a torso hit

229
00:23:24,294 --> 00:23:26,929
- which will immobilize you completely -...

230
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:32,962
...but if either side gets one cadet
through the enemy's gate unharmed...

231
00:23:32,988 --> 00:23:35,993
...that army will win.
Regardless of points already scored.

232
00:23:35,994 --> 00:23:39,474
- Am I clear?
- Sir! Yes Sir!

233
00:23:39,963 --> 00:23:45,198
Dear Valentine, so this is Battle School...
Every day, hours of training...

234
00:23:45,199 --> 00:23:48,236
...and far more homework
than we ever had on Earth.

235
00:23:48,306 --> 00:23:51,762
We train in hand-to-hand combat...

236
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,962
...it keeps us in shape...

237
00:23:53,962 --> 00:23:58,850
...and aggressive.
- And up! And one! Two!

238
00:24:00,858 --> 00:24:03,873
- I feel Peter in me whenever I fight...
- Wiggin!

239
00:24:04,273 --> 00:24:05,679
... I wish I didn't.

240
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,961
We've been studying Formic flight
patterns for three months now,...

241
00:24:09,061 --> 00:24:10,736
...they seem entirely random.

242
00:24:10,737 --> 00:24:13,912
The truth is
we really don't understand our enemy...

243
00:24:14,013 --> 00:24:19,878
...and no one ever adequately explains how Mazer Rackham
actually defeated the entire fleet.

244
00:24:20,507 --> 00:24:22,905
The Colonel said he expects me to lead

245
00:24:22,905 --> 00:24:25,802
But how? What makes a good leader?

246
00:24:25,803 --> 00:24:31,407
Everyone here is very different.
So many many things to learn,

247
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,976
always very little sleep.

248
00:24:33,552 --> 00:24:35,018
Please write back.

249
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:37,531
I haven't heard from you...
How are you?

250
00:24:37,532 --> 00:24:41,337
Is Peter behaving?
Are you getting my e-mails? I miss...

251
00:24:41,651 --> 00:24:44,199
Attention on deck!

252
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:53,707
Evening, launchies. At ease.

253
00:24:54,301 --> 00:24:57,372
I'm pleased to see that most
of you are performing well...

254
00:24:57,373 --> 00:25:00,793
...as you know, competition for
Command School is tough...

255
00:25:00,794 --> 00:25:06,063
...some in the higher ranks have failed to
meet our standards and are being sent home.

256
00:25:06,064 --> 00:25:09,845
So... I may have the opportunity
to promote some of you.

257
00:25:09,846 --> 00:25:12,499
Look to your left.

258
00:25:13,582 --> 00:25:16,131
Look to your right.

259
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,899
These are NOT your friends!

260
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,693
They are competition!

261
00:25:23,427 --> 00:25:26,742
- Keep up the hard work!
- Ten-shun!

262
00:25:26,743 --> 00:25:31,804
Sir!
Is our email being blocked?

263
00:25:31,805 --> 00:25:34,875
It's just that none of us
received any replies from home.

264
00:25:34,876 --> 00:25:37,959
All communication is being
temporarily held back.

265
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,486
- Why sir?
- Launchy, it is not your place...

266
00:25:41,486 --> 00:25:45,220
Your families will not understand
what we're doing here...

267
00:25:45,221 --> 00:25:49,935
...and none of you need the distraction
of their replies!

268
00:25:50,144 --> 00:25:53,110
I thought our privacy rights
had been restored, sir.

269
00:25:53,111 --> 00:25:57,756
You have the right to privately
think whatever you wish, Wiggin!

270
00:25:59,757 --> 00:26:03,770
But there's too much at stake to allow your
unfiltered thoughts..

271
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:06,982
...to leave this facility.

272
00:26:07,575 --> 00:26:11,520
Yes, sir!

273
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:20,632
Keep it up snot, and you will
never make it to Command School!

274
00:26:20,633 --> 00:26:22,797
- I thought it was a legitimate question.
- What?

275
00:26:22,867 --> 00:26:27,614
- You said if we have a legitimate question...
- Drop and give me twenty!

276
00:26:37,354 --> 00:26:40,808
- You think you're the smartest kid in the School?
- No, sir!

277
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:43,766
- You will never be a Commander!
I will never salute you!

278
00:26:43,766 --> 00:26:48,060
- Yes you will, Sergeant.
- Give me twenty more!

279
00:26:57,312 --> 00:26:59,929
Get up!

280
00:27:01,465 --> 00:27:06,631
You do not speak unless spoken to.
Am I clear?

281
00:27:06,632 --> 00:27:08,552
Sir! Yes, sir!

282
00:27:09,564 --> 00:27:15,149
- Even if I have a legitimate question?
- Shut it, Wiggin!

283
00:27:20,596 --> 00:27:23,764
Now go to sleep. All of you.

284
00:27:36,131 --> 00:27:40,902
You heard him.
Get some sleep.

285
00:27:52,363 --> 00:27:56,727
We've only 3 passing scores on
the Deep Space navigation test.

286
00:27:56,727 --> 00:28:00,217
Alai, Bean and Ender!
What happened here?

287
00:28:00,218 --> 00:28:03,802
- They're probably cheating.
- Your mother cheated that's why you look like a plumber.

288
00:28:03,803 --> 00:28:09,214
- Zip it!(???) You think this is a game?
- No, ma'am.

289
00:28:09,503 --> 00:28:12,167
- We are preparing for war!
- Yes, ma'am.

290
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:16,777
Now the problem was simple...
how do you slingshot your forces...

291
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:20,546
...into an attack position
on the blind side of this moon...

292
00:28:20,546 --> 00:28:24,735
...using the gravitational pull from this planet?
This is basic rocket science, people!

293
00:28:24,806 --> 00:28:26,912
Ender! Get down here and explain.

294
00:28:27,995 --> 00:28:32,147
Ma'am, I think Bean or Alai
have a better hang on this than I do.

295
00:28:32,149 --> 00:28:35,220
All right.
Alai, come and explain.

296
00:28:38,978 --> 00:28:42,969
Ma'am, we aim to approach the planet
in the direction it's moving...

297
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:47,939
- ...that way we benefit from it's energy of motion.
- Something..?

298
00:28:49,941 --> 00:28:55,034
- Go on, Alai.
- Of course, there's a moon we have to pass here.

299
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,191
That complicates things.

300
00:28:56,716 --> 00:28:59,403
Because the moon's moving in
the opposite direction to us,

301
00:28:59,429 --> 00:29:01,136
we get a gravitational break in...

302
00:29:03,137 --> 00:29:05,370
Who sent this?

303
00:29:05,371 --> 00:29:07,186
Who sent what, Bernard?

304
00:29:08,454 --> 00:29:09,456
Nothing.

305
00:29:12,546 --> 00:29:13,546
Oh.

306
00:29:14,772 --> 00:29:22,349
- If you can't take it Bernard, don't dish it out.
- Yes, ma'am!

307
00:30:10,932 --> 00:30:14,353
Welcome to Games and Recreation.

308
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:18,473
Cerebral control initiated.

309
00:30:47,498 --> 00:30:52,998
One is poison, one is not.
Choose right and you go to Fairyland.

310
00:30:53,323 --> 00:30:55,323
He's found the mind game.

311
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:59,148
Decide well, punch or hell!(???)

312
00:31:13,198 --> 00:31:17,198
<i>- Ha ha</i>
- Who authorized his access to this?

313
00:31:17,198 --> 00:31:19,198
- I did.
<i>-Try again, Mickey Mouse.</i>

314
00:31:19,199 --> 00:31:23,199
- To what end?
- Not every battle can be won, Hyrum. 
  The way he plays the game...

315
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,200
...reveals his state of mind. If you
won't let me assess him one-on-one,

316
00:31:26,201 --> 00:31:28,224
I need some other way to know 
what he's feeling.

317
00:31:28,225 --> 00:31:32,750
I don't care how he's feeling.
I want him to toughen up, learn how to lead.

318
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:36,250
But before we make him a leader,
let's see how he deals with frustration.

319
00:31:48,775 --> 00:31:50,775
- Come on!
<i>- Oh dear!</i>

320
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
-Whatchu doin?
- Playing a stupid game.

321
00:31:55,001 --> 00:31:56,501
No matter what I choose, I die.

322
00:31:56,801 --> 00:32:00,801
- It's rigged.
- You're back. One more time.

323
00:32:00,802 --> 00:32:02,802
- Can I watch?
- Sure.

324
00:32:03,803 --> 00:32:08,803
<i>One is poison, one is not. Choose
right and you go to Fairyland.</i>

325
00:32:08,804 --> 00:32:10,804
- Which you gonna choose?
- Neither.

326
00:32:12,304 --> 00:32:14,304
<i>Come on Mickey Mouse,
come on.......</i>

327
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,930
<i>Aaah!!</i>

328
00:32:33,805 --> 00:32:39,305
- You killed him. Why?
- That's what they want from us.

329
00:32:40,306 --> 00:32:43,306
Follow the rules, you lose. 
Choose violence, you win.

330
00:32:43,306 --> 00:32:47,806
- I've never seen anyone do that.
- Perfect....

331
00:32:48,307 --> 00:32:50,307
He's perfect!

332
00:32:52,307 --> 00:32:57,307
Ender Wiggin, you are assigned to Salamander army,
Commander Bonzo Madrid, effective immediately.

333
00:32:57,308 --> 00:33:02,308
Orders of Colonel Graff. Follow the green lights.
Take nothing with you. Go now.

334
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:07,033
-What are they doing?
- They're promoting you.

335
00:33:18,127 --> 00:33:19,625
Ender!?

336
00:33:19,626 --> 00:33:22,034
Yeah?

337
00:33:25,141 --> 00:33:29,412
'As-salaam-aleykum'.
Peace to you.

338
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:41,957
- C'mon!
- Ball ! Strike two! Play ball!

339
00:33:42,584 --> 00:33:45,551
- Alright, sir - strike two.
- Play ball!

340
00:33:49,356 --> 00:33:51,730
You lost, Launchy?

341
00:33:52,009 --> 00:33:54,034
I'm Ender Wiggin...

342
00:33:56,372 --> 00:33:58,117
...supposed to report to Bonzo Madrid.

343
00:33:58,118 --> 00:33:59,829
So you're the replacement?

344
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:02,306
- Ender Wiggin.
- Petra Arkanian.

345
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:06,195
Only girl in the Salamander army with more
balls than anybody else in this bunk room.

346
00:34:06,195 --> 00:34:09,162
Whoof! Mama Petra, she talking!

347
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:14,747
- Wiggin!
- Sir! Yes Sir! Andrew Wiggin reassigned.

348
00:34:14,748 --> 00:34:18,237
I asked for a replacement for O'Reilley
and this is what I get!

349
00:34:18,238 --> 00:34:21,977
A useless, skinny, untrained snot.

350
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:23,892
- I'm a quick study.
- Let me be clear!

351
00:34:23,893 --> 00:34:26,895
I intend to trade you A.S.A.P.

352
00:34:26,896 --> 00:34:30,455
My army is undefeated in the last 21 battles...

353
00:34:30,456 --> 00:34:33,807
...I might try to make it to
Command School within 6 months...

354
00:34:33,808 --> 00:34:36,448
...you can get your training
at someone else's expense.

355
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:39,242
- He's all heart.
- Shut it, nica (???)!
- Easy, Bonzo.

356
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,197
Watch your mouth, Mick!

357
00:34:42,152 --> 00:34:43,652
Here's the deal, snot...

358
00:34:43,653 --> 00:34:48,435
...when we go into battle, you will not pass
through the gates until all my soldiers are through...

359
00:34:48,436 --> 00:34:55,160
...then, you will remain just inside the gates,
with your weapon undrawn and unfired till the game ends.

360
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,093
- So I must do nothing?
- You're to keep out of the way!

361
00:34:58,094 --> 00:35:00,296
You bunk in the back of the room.

362
00:35:20,087 --> 00:35:22,739
You know, Bonzo
doesn't like to lose...

363
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:26,300
...he doesn't want an untrained Launchy
screwing up his perfect maneuvers...

364
00:35:26,401 --> 00:35:30,673
...but the Battle Room is open 24/7. During
free time, I could show you some moves.

365
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:55,020
Ready?

366
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:01,094
...3... 2... 1!

367
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,341
Impressive!

368
00:36:41,415 --> 00:36:43,580
Your turn.

369
00:36:51,154 --> 00:36:55,392
Hey, you can't just keep your thumb on the trigger.
You need half a second to recharge.

370
00:36:55,393 --> 00:36:58,617
- At least you don't have any bad habits.
- I don't have any good ones, either.

371
00:36:58,618 --> 00:37:01,377
I'll give you those.

372
00:37:06,131 --> 00:37:07,131
Relax!

373
00:37:07,132 --> 00:37:10,215
Further your target, the longer
you have to hold the beam.

374
00:37:10,216 --> 00:37:11,624
Fire.

375
00:37:16,674 --> 00:37:18,558
Leave it longer.

376
00:37:19,605 --> 00:37:23,167
...it's the difference between a tenth and a half second
but in battle, that's a long time...

377
00:37:23,201 --> 00:37:26,727
Aim. Fire. Hold. Recharge.

378
00:37:27,623 --> 00:37:28,915
That's it!

379
00:37:29,404 --> 00:37:33,384
Learn where your trigger actually
fires and ride the edge.

380
00:37:33,538 --> 00:37:35,877
Now you're getting it!

381
00:37:36,226 --> 00:37:40,625
3... 2... 1...
Go!

382
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:43,801
- Let's see if you can beat me. Once! Just beat me once!
- Come on! You can do it!

383
00:37:47,047 --> 00:37:50,476
- That's five in a row! Who's the boss?
- You the boss Bonzo.

384
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:54,142
That's right, I'm the boss.
Let's go again! I'm gonna make this six.

385
00:37:54,143 --> 00:37:57,343
<i>- Ready? What you guys doing? C'mon</i>
- Yeah, let's do it again sometime.

386
00:37:57,344 --> 00:37:58,951
That'd be swell.

387
00:38:03,526 --> 00:38:05,304
- Where were you?
- Practicing.

388
00:38:05,305 --> 00:38:08,099
- In free time.
- You don't practice with her.

389
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:11,275
In fact, you don't practice at all!

390
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:17,012
May I speak to you privately, sir?

391
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:25,459
Wiggin!

392
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:29,160
Hey, <i>pednico (???)</i>,
don't you ever turn your back on me!

393
00:38:29,161 --> 00:38:31,219
If I'm gonna be useful in this toon,
I have to practice.

394
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,397
- You will do what I tell you!
- I will follow all commands you are authorized to give...

395
00:38:34,397 --> 00:38:38,306
...but if you take away my free time
I will get you iced.

396
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:44,602
Are you threatening me, snot?

397
00:38:45,336 --> 00:38:47,499
No.

398
00:38:48,023 --> 00:38:51,164
Listen. I know you wanna trade me...

399
00:38:51,165 --> 00:38:54,061
...but no one will take me
if I don't know anything.

400
00:38:54,062 --> 00:38:56,540
Let me practice,
you can get rid of me sooner.

401
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:57,868
I already gave you an order!

402
00:38:58,008 --> 00:38:59,753
I know, in front of everybody...

403
00:38:59,753 --> 00:39:02,091
...and you don't want your soldiers
to think that you backed down...

404
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:05,137
so for tonight you can say
that you won this argument...

405
00:39:05,138 --> 00:39:08,104
...then tomorrow you can tell
everybody that you changed your mind.

406
00:39:08,105 --> 00:39:11,888
You'll look generous. I'll get to train.
We both win. Deal?

407
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:16,053
You better watch your back, Wiggin!

408
00:39:28,052 --> 00:39:30,112
Wake up!

409
00:39:30,705 --> 00:39:34,544
Wake up <i>nis spendeblos (???)</i>!
Battle with Leopards in 10 minutes!

410
00:39:34,545 --> 00:39:36,664
- Hey! Wiggin!
- Yes Sir!

411
00:39:36,689 --> 00:39:37,954
- I changed my mind.

412
00:39:39,955 --> 00:39:46,692
- Maybe by watching my toons you'll learn
   something and I can trade you easier.
- Yes Sir! Thank you sir!

413
00:39:46,692 --> 00:39:49,519
Move.
Everybody, let's move!

414
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:54,930
>Salamanders all-for-one< x2

415
00:39:54,931 --> 00:40:00,481
>There's no one like us under the sun!<x2

416
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:06,241
>Salamanders! We're on top<x2

417
00:40:06,242 --> 00:40:11,617
>When it comes to winning, we never stop!<x2

418
00:40:11,781 --> 00:40:13,968
Salamander halt!

419
00:40:13,968 --> 00:40:16,098
At ease.

420
00:40:16,517 --> 00:40:17,842
What's the play?

421
00:40:17,843 --> 00:40:23,777
Four winds - Toon A, up.
B, left. C, right. D, down.

422
00:40:23,777 --> 00:40:25,558
You! Wiggin.

423
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:26,954
You hang back, near the gate.

424
00:40:26,954 --> 00:40:30,594
- Bonzo, my toon will be a man short...
- He knows nothing about our formation, Stink...

425
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,098
...He'll only get in the way.

426
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:34,960
You come out last.
Hang back and observe.

427
00:40:34,961 --> 00:40:37,044
We don't need you.

428
00:40:37,045 --> 00:40:39,221
Step aside.

429
00:40:41,443 --> 00:40:48,005
Go Salamander!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go Salamander! Go! Go!

430
00:41:20,331 --> 00:41:25,010
We gotta break 'em up!
Fly - you lock us in...
Petra rides chariot(???)...

431
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:26,545
- Got it!
- Ready?

432
00:41:26,545 --> 00:41:29,015
- Ready!
- In... 3... 2... 1

433
00:41:44,628 --> 00:41:48,816
- I'm hit!
- Shoot! Keep shooting, Petra!

434
00:41:48,888 --> 00:41:51,784
- (???) Go!
- I'm on it!

435
00:42:06,753 --> 00:42:08,753
<i>Stay behind me!</i>

436
00:42:12,778 --> 00:42:13,778
<i>We need cover!</i>

437
00:42:13,779 --> 00:42:14,895
Wiggin!

438
00:42:14,896 --> 00:42:18,562
What are you doing?
I told you to stay back!

439
00:42:25,405 --> 00:42:28,405
- You ok?
- What are you doing here? Bonzo will kill you!

440
00:42:28,406 --> 00:42:32,385
- Can't go back now.
- Well then get in the game. We're losing!

441
00:42:32,385 --> 00:42:35,003
They got half their toon
back through their gate.

442
00:42:35,004 --> 00:42:37,586
Put your feet to mine.
Redirect me.

443
00:42:37,587 --> 00:42:42,753
- Play dead. Don't draw your weapon,
  till you know you're hot.(???)
- Got it.

444
00:42:42,754 --> 00:42:46,802
3... 2... 1..

445
00:43:58,624 --> 00:44:00,698
Smart move! Holding Wiggin back.

446
00:44:26,087 --> 00:44:27,762
Where'd you learn all this?

447
00:44:27,763 --> 00:44:31,498
- I had a brother.
- Had?
- Have.

448
00:44:32,091 --> 00:44:36,258
Come on, let's go again.
But use your arms, not your hips.

449
00:44:36,711 --> 00:44:41,564
Officer on deck!
Ten-hut!

450
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:45,019
I thought I told you
not to train with her.

451
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:48,965
It thought we'd agreed that
free time was free, sir.

452
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:52,351
At ease.

453
00:44:54,201 --> 00:44:57,516
Stop it, Bonzo!

454
00:44:57,517 --> 00:45:01,813
Try making me look like a fool again
and I'll kill you.

455
00:45:11,538 --> 00:45:13,087
You ok?

456
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,219
Yeah.

457
00:46:18,648 --> 00:46:21,615
What do you want me to do?

458
00:46:26,724 --> 00:46:28,573
Valentine?

459
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:34,822
How can you be in my game?

460
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:12,563
Well done.
You're a killer now.

461
00:48:15,716 --> 00:48:19,974
Nightmares, Launchy?
Keep 'em to yourself!

462
00:48:20,638 --> 00:48:24,874
You said the game would reveal
his state of mind, not grow with it.

463
00:48:25,048 --> 00:48:28,329
How did his psycho
brother end up in the game?

464
00:48:28,329 --> 00:48:32,553
- He's obviously feeling some psychological pressure...
- Of course he's feeling pressure, Anderson...

465
00:48:32,554 --> 00:48:37,055
...This is a boot camp, for kids who
are gonna have to face a real enemy!

466
00:48:37,056 --> 00:48:42,677
The game is a thought relationship between the child
and the computer. Together they create stories...

467
00:48:42,678 --> 00:48:44,980
Then change the story.

468
00:48:44,981 --> 00:48:48,006
This story's written by the child's
emotional reality. I can't change that!

469
00:48:48,007 --> 00:48:50,300
I don't know how these images
got into the game!

470
00:48:52,825 --> 00:48:55,442
Erase the game.

471
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:23,580
You've done well.

472
00:49:25,185 --> 00:49:26,442
Very well.

473
00:49:26,443 --> 00:49:30,456
Top test scores in class.
Highest Battle Room ratings.

474
00:49:30,456 --> 00:49:33,493
But you have a habit of
upsetting your commander.

475
00:49:33,494 --> 00:49:37,089
I find it hard to respect someone
just because they outrank me, sir.

476
00:49:37,089 --> 00:49:40,174
- Puts you in a difficult position,
  doesn't it?
- Yes, sir.

477
00:49:40,174 --> 00:49:43,105
You don't like taking orders from Bonzo.

478
00:49:43,106 --> 00:49:44,363
No, sir.

479
00:49:44,363 --> 00:49:48,481
Perhaps you'd prefer to give them yourself?

480
00:49:48,482 --> 00:49:54,032
- Sir?
- How'd you like to lead
  your own army - Dragon army?

481
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:56,335
Sir, I've never heard of a Dragon army.

482
00:49:56,336 --> 00:49:59,756
We discontinued the name four years ago.

483
00:49:59,757 --> 00:50:02,479
No Dragon army ever won a battle.

484
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,366
- Then why not a new name, sir?
- Because we already have the uniforms.

485
00:50:07,555 --> 00:50:09,300
And who will be in this army, sir?

486
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,463
Misfits, like you...

487
00:50:11,464 --> 00:50:15,875
...oddballs, who might just be brilliant,
with the right commander.

488
00:50:18,934 --> 00:50:21,309
Your new quarters.

489
00:50:29,873 --> 00:50:32,969
Your soldiers are being notified now.
You'll address them in 15 minutes.

490
00:50:36,086 --> 00:50:38,636
Do you think they'll follow me?

491
00:51:19,851 --> 00:51:24,424
Atten-hut!
Officer on deck.

492
00:51:25,612 --> 00:51:27,112
At ease.

493
00:51:27,113 --> 00:51:29,346
Welcome to Dragon army.

494
00:51:29,347 --> 00:51:32,407
Bunking will be arranged with youngest
at the front and veterans at the back.

495
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:38,970
- Ender, every other commander has their seniors closest to the door.
- Well, I don't intend to be like every other commander.

496
00:51:38,972 --> 00:51:41,728
What am I doing here Ender?
You don't even like me.

497
00:51:41,729 --> 00:51:43,823
I didn't select this army, Bernard...

498
00:51:43,824 --> 00:51:45,965
...but I intend to make it the best
at this school.

499
00:51:46,523 --> 00:51:49,385
I think you can help make that happen.

500
00:51:50,177 --> 00:51:52,795
Am I wrong?

501
00:51:53,296 --> 00:51:55,145
No, sir!

502
00:51:55,146 --> 00:51:57,134
You'll respect one another.

503
00:51:57,134 --> 00:52:01,044
If anybody has an idea they think
is better than mine... I wanna hear it.

504
00:52:01,045 --> 00:52:04,674
I can't be expected to do all the
thinking in this army, can I, Bean?

505
00:52:04,675 --> 00:52:05,757
No, sir!

506
00:52:05,758 --> 00:52:07,643
Then let's get suited up.

507
00:52:07,643 --> 00:52:10,610
- Training starts now!
- Sir! Yes, sir!

508
00:52:21,584 --> 00:52:25,667
He's pushing them hard.
Might even make something of Bernard.

509
00:52:25,668 --> 00:52:28,833
Command School's pressing for a decision.

510
00:52:29,136 --> 00:52:32,348
Tell them we need more time!

511
00:52:32,871 --> 00:52:35,630
We're out of time.

512
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:41,216
- Lieutenant! Tomorrow's game will commence at 0300.
- Yes Sir!

513
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:59,728
Wake up! Wake up!
Battle with Salamander AND Leopard in five!

514
00:52:59,729 --> 00:53:02,869
Two armies at once!
The Colonel's changing the rules!

515
00:53:02,869 --> 00:53:06,920
In a battle with the Formics,
there will be no rules!

516
00:53:07,444 --> 00:53:08,665
You alright?

517
00:53:08,666 --> 00:53:10,340
I twisted my ankle.

518
00:53:10,341 --> 00:53:11,842
How bad?

519
00:53:11,843 --> 00:53:14,111
- Not good.
- Dink, get him to the infirmary.

520
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:16,590
The rest of you!
Let's move! C'mon! We're late!

521
00:53:16,591 --> 00:53:17,591
C'mon!

522
00:53:28,645 --> 00:53:30,774
They already opened the gate?

523
00:53:46,531 --> 00:53:51,104
- Petra?
- Two armies weren't enough? They had to block your view too?

524
00:53:51,104 --> 00:53:52,395
What are you doing here?

525
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:56,548
Colonel said you needed a sub. Guess he thought
your odds were zero with me on the other team.

526
00:53:56,549 --> 00:54:01,122
- Bonzo agreed to this?
- Colonel Graff's orders!
- He didn't have a choice!

527
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:03,380
Dink. Kneel.

528
00:54:03,381 --> 00:54:06,488
- What?
- I have an idea... Kneel.

529
00:54:08,862 --> 00:54:15,390
Ready?
... 3... 2... 1!
Fire!

530
00:54:29,401 --> 00:54:31,493
- Whoa, whoa whoa! Look out!
- Aah!

531
00:54:31,496 --> 00:54:33,346
12 men on the wall!

532
00:54:33,346 --> 00:54:34,882
12 down, 20 to go.

533
00:54:34,882 --> 00:54:39,385
They could be right behind these forward
stars, or all the way back at their gate.

534
00:54:41,758 --> 00:54:44,307
- Ready?
- Ready!

535
00:55:04,043 --> 00:55:06,417
Pull!

536
00:55:19,752 --> 00:55:23,299
The (???) have a bunch of stars around
their gate, like a giant doughnut..

537
00:55:23,325 --> 00:55:24,812
they're just hanging behind 'em.

538
00:55:24,813 --> 00:55:27,151
- No one closer?
- Nah.

539
00:55:27,152 --> 00:55:28,731
Nice.

540
00:55:28,732 --> 00:55:30,721
Let's see how they handle a formation.

541
00:55:30,722 --> 00:55:33,784
- We've never done a formation.
- Then they won't expect one.

542
00:55:41,093 --> 00:55:42,454
We still outnumber him.

543
00:55:42,455 --> 00:55:46,736
- We storm him and crush him.
- Neh! We hold our positions. He has to come to us!

544
00:55:46,737 --> 00:55:47,809
We can't lose!

545
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:58,758
Open fire!

546
00:56:01,656 --> 00:56:03,016
They're drifting outward!

547
00:56:03,017 --> 00:56:11,429
On my count, spoon 2 split (???)
from 1 - changing direction, 30 degrees
in... 3... 2... 1! Now!

548
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:14,326
Spoon four, spoon 6 (???)
Now!

549
00:56:14,327 --> 00:56:16,665
Spoon 5 (???) now!

550
00:56:24,974 --> 00:56:26,160
- I'm hit!
- Hold on, Alai!

551
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,988
- (???) Are we there yet?
- Almost.

552
00:56:31,864 --> 00:56:33,180
Keep shooting!

553
00:56:38,509 --> 00:56:40,672
We did it!

554
00:56:40,673 --> 00:56:43,291
Eat that! Dragons rule!

555
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:46,805
Yeah!
Who's gonna beat us now?

556
00:56:46,806 --> 00:56:49,144
Still think he's not ready?

557
00:56:50,366 --> 00:56:51,902
Don't be smug.

558
00:57:21,296 --> 00:57:22,761
I'm tired of you, Wiggin.

559
00:57:22,762 --> 00:57:27,977
You know, your father would be proud. Come to
fight a boy in the showers. With your buddies.

560
00:57:30,967 --> 00:57:33,583
Go watch the door.

561
00:57:33,584 --> 00:57:36,412
GO!

562
00:57:46,093 --> 00:57:47,141
Look.

563
00:57:47,874 --> 00:57:50,631
You can say you won...

564
00:57:50,632 --> 00:57:52,166
...I'll say you taught me a lesson...

565
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:53,632
No, coward!

566
00:57:53,633 --> 00:57:55,693
Raise your fists.

567
00:57:56,427 --> 00:57:58,730
Come on, fight!
C'mon!

568
00:57:58,731 --> 00:58:01,837
C'mon fight! C'mon!

569
00:58:10,332 --> 00:58:12,602
I could break your arm!

570
00:58:23,946 --> 00:58:26,389
Bonzo!?

571
00:58:27,508 --> 00:58:30,370
Bonzo! Bonzo!

572
00:58:30,603 --> 00:58:34,513
Help!
We need help in here!

573
00:58:44,194 --> 00:58:47,476
Everybody knows he started it.

574
00:58:51,177 --> 00:58:52,327
Ender...

575
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:53,688
...I'm so sorry.

576
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:55,505
Major!

577
00:58:57,984 --> 00:59:02,173
- We should never have allowed you to be alone...
- Not now, Major!

578
00:59:02,662 --> 00:59:05,419
Leave us!

579
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:15,252
Leave him...
Now!

580
00:59:15,916 --> 00:59:18,603
You too, cadet.

581
00:59:38,946 --> 00:59:41,668
He's gonna die, isn't he?

582
00:59:42,994 --> 00:59:45,788
No. He's not.

583
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,405
Please don't lie to me.

584
00:59:49,034 --> 00:59:54,433
We're gonna send him home,
back to Earth,
so he can get better.

585
00:59:55,446 --> 00:59:58,518
- I want to go with him.
- We can't let you go.

586
00:59:58,902 --> 01:00:02,532
- You've come so far...
- And I wanna talk to my sister!

587
01:00:02,533 --> 01:00:05,673
The fleet owns you, Ender.

588
01:00:06,268 --> 01:00:09,304
Strategos would never allow it.

589
01:00:09,304 --> 01:00:14,296
Send me home Colonel,
or I will resign.

590
01:00:15,181 --> 01:00:19,454
Don't threaten me, boy,
I'm not the enemy.

591
01:00:25,864 --> 01:00:28,599
I'm not so sure.

592
01:00:31,798 --> 01:00:34,777
I won't play this game anymore!

593
01:00:37,291 --> 01:00:39,839
I quit!

594
01:00:41,654 --> 01:00:43,958
What are you gonna do?

595
01:00:44,761 --> 01:00:47,798
Waste millions on a loser?

596
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,699
You wanted to see me.

597
01:00:55,700 --> 01:01:01,634
You can't resign.
You have an obligation to stay here
and convince him to do his duty.

598
01:01:01,635 --> 01:01:05,901
My father trained horses. I've raised
yearlings since I was 5 years old.

599
01:01:05,927 --> 01:01:09,348
I know a thoroughbred when I see one.
We can't lose him!

600
01:01:09,349 --> 01:01:13,154
My God! You really don't see
them as children, do you?

601
01:01:13,155 --> 01:01:16,330
It used to be a war crime to recruit anyone under the age of 15!

602
01:01:16,331 --> 01:01:20,834
When the war is over,
we can have the luxury of debating the
morality of what we do.

603
01:01:20,834 --> 01:01:22,892
When it's over,
what will be left of the boy?

604
01:01:22,892 --> 01:01:25,035
What does it matter
if there's nothing left at all?

605
01:01:25,036 --> 01:01:28,317
We're using these children to win the war.

606
01:01:28,655 --> 01:01:34,275
And if they come home, it's my job to put them back together again.

607
01:01:41,048 --> 01:01:43,225
Thanks for what you've done.

608
01:02:21,206 --> 01:02:22,357
Where's Ender?

609
01:02:22,358 --> 01:02:27,210
- Hello Valentine.
- Why are you here? Did something happen?
- He won't let me see him.

610
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:30,422
I need you to take a ride with me.

611
01:02:38,276 --> 01:02:40,452
He's gonna be happy to see you.

612
01:02:40,453 --> 01:02:43,209
C'mon, you just want him to re-enlist.

613
01:02:43,211 --> 01:02:45,129
I want him to save lives.

614
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:48,620
What about his life?

615
01:03:24,183 --> 01:03:26,871
Been sitting by Bonzo's bed...

616
01:03:27,186 --> 01:03:29,454
...waiting for him to recover...

617
01:03:30,467 --> 01:03:32,699
...he may never wake up.

618
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:38,216
- Ender, he attacked first.
- And I fought back.
  Just like Peter taught me.

619
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:42,159
I've had a lot of fights, Val.

620
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:46,558
I've won because I 've always
understood what my enemy thinks.

621
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:50,784
- But when I truly understand them...
- you also love them.

622
01:03:52,623 --> 01:03:58,123
I think it's impossible to truly understand
someone and not love them the way they love themselves.

623
01:03:58,162 --> 01:03:59,270
But in that moment...

624
01:03:59,279 --> 01:04:01,734
- You beat them.
- I destroy them!

625
01:04:02,118 --> 01:04:05,307
I make it impossible for them
to ever hurt me again.

626
01:04:09,205 --> 01:04:12,416
Ender, they want me
to talk you into going back.

627
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:18,280
- I told them I won't cooperate.
- I don't think you are hiding here just because you care about Bonzo.

628
01:04:18,281 --> 01:04:22,050
I think you're hiding because you're afraid.

629
01:04:22,051 --> 01:04:24,425
Afraid you don't know your enemy...

630
01:04:24,426 --> 01:04:25,984
...afraid you might lose, but...

631
01:04:25,985 --> 01:04:29,719
...but what if you are the
next Mazer Rackham?

632
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:32,315
You can't hide here forever.

633
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:36,934
If you sit here...

634
01:04:37,284 --> 01:04:42,484
...if you don't try... we will all be lost.

635
01:04:52,178 --> 01:04:55,285
I'll miss you.

636
01:04:56,367 --> 01:04:59,300
I'll miss you too.

637
01:05:18,292 --> 01:05:22,690
I need to know that you will
not block my e-mails again.

638
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:32,942
Attention! Prepare for transporter
docking operations!
Initiating final approach!

639
01:05:34,221 --> 01:05:36,385
I thought we were going
back to Battle School?

640
01:05:36,386 --> 01:05:38,934
- We're not.
- Where are we going?

641
01:05:40,295 --> 01:05:43,821
Much further.

642
01:05:51,223 --> 01:05:52,897
"Dear Valentine...

643
01:05:52,898 --> 01:05:57,017
...I must now travel to our advance command base near the Formics home planet

644
01:05:57,018 --> 01:05:59,250
where I'll begin final training.

645
01:05:59,251 --> 01:06:02,533
If successful, I'll command
the entire invasion fleet.

646
01:06:03,243 --> 01:06:05,232
I wish there was another way...

647
01:06:05,232 --> 01:06:07,745
...but war seems inevitable.

648
01:06:07,746 --> 01:06:09,350
Stay safe.

649
01:06:09,351 --> 01:06:11,725
Love,
Ender."

650
01:07:25,765 --> 01:07:27,719
Not very hospitable, is it?

651
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:32,222
We took it from the Formics,
27 years after Rackham's victory.

652
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:36,167
Flushed them out of these tunnels
like rats from a sewer...

653
01:07:36,167 --> 01:07:38,575
...drove them all the way back to their home planet.

654
01:07:38,576 --> 01:07:41,019
- How long did they live here?
- We're not sure...

655
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:43,754
...this was a forward staging post
for their invasion of Earth.

656
01:07:43,754 --> 01:07:46,756
Built our base here to be
closer to their home planet

657
01:07:46,757 --> 01:07:51,086
to allow instantaneous communication
by ansible with our attack fleet.

658
01:07:51,087 --> 01:07:53,599
If they're on their home planet,
do we have them contained?

659
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:57,578
- For now.
- If we have them boxed in,
  why go to war?

660
01:07:57,579 --> 01:08:03,268
For the same reason that you kept kicking
that bully before I recruited you.

661
01:08:03,268 --> 01:08:07,701
The purpose of this war
is to prevent all future wars.

662
01:08:07,702 --> 01:08:11,541
Your training begins first thing
tomorrow morning.

663
01:08:11,542 --> 01:08:14,917
Sergeant Dap will show you
to your quarters.

664
01:08:15,988 --> 01:08:18,326
Yes, sir!

665
01:08:27,125 --> 01:08:29,009
We're still reseeding the atmosphere...

666
01:08:29,009 --> 01:08:30,998
...it's breathable, but thin.

667
01:08:30,999 --> 01:08:34,163
In the event of an evacuation,
two breaths every minute from one of these

668
01:08:34,164 --> 01:08:36,957
will compensate for lower levels
of surface oxygen.

669
01:08:37,062 --> 01:08:39,146
Lights out in five.

670
01:09:50,605 --> 01:09:52,211
Who are you?

671
01:09:55,994 --> 01:10:00,497
Look this may be amusing to you,
but they'll come looking for me!

672
01:10:03,882 --> 01:10:09,292
You want to fight me? Is that the test?
To see if I'll attack an old man?

673
01:10:09,293 --> 01:10:11,423
Well, I won't.

674
01:10:15,263 --> 01:10:18,893
I'll just sit this one out.

675
01:10:23,758 --> 01:10:27,736
- Okay, you win.
- Since when do you tell the enemy when he's won?

676
01:10:27,738 --> 01:10:31,751
I surprised you once. Why didn't you
destroy me immediately after?

677
01:10:31,752 --> 01:10:35,242
- I thought you were a teacher!
- There is no teacher but the enemy.

678
01:10:35,243 --> 01:10:43,026
Enemy will tell you where you're weak,
where he's strong. From now on, I am your enemy, got it?

679
01:10:43,026 --> 01:10:44,248
Yes.

680
01:10:44,529 --> 01:10:45,960
Good.

681
01:10:52,570 --> 01:10:55,659
During training, I will devise
the strategy of your enemy.

682
01:10:55,685 --> 01:10:59,716
Remember he is stronger than you. From
now on, you are always about to lose.

683
01:11:03,077 --> 01:11:05,486
Sir.

684
01:11:06,685 --> 01:11:09,372
Do you have a name?

685
01:11:09,373 --> 01:11:12,270
Mazer Rackham!

686
01:11:12,829 --> 01:11:15,551
What? You thought I was dead?

687
01:11:16,074 --> 01:11:17,263
Sir...

688
01:11:17,995 --> 01:11:22,394
...I've been building models of your plane
since I was six years old.

689
01:11:23,210 --> 01:11:25,757
I have a question, sir.

690
01:11:25,758 --> 01:11:31,692
On the vids... they always cut out right
after you destroy the one carrier.

691
01:11:31,692 --> 01:11:33,786
Why?

692
01:11:34,206 --> 01:11:36,335
Get dressed.

693
01:11:39,686 --> 01:11:43,594
Sir, I've already seen this.
I wanna know what happens after.

694
01:11:43,595 --> 01:11:46,039
Just watch.

695
01:12:01,319 --> 01:12:04,495
After the explosion cleared...

696
01:12:04,496 --> 01:12:10,151
...everything was incredibly still.

697
01:12:11,896 --> 01:12:14,548
Their ships just stopped shooting.

698
01:12:14,549 --> 01:12:17,961
Then they started falling out of the sky.

699
01:12:25,581 --> 01:12:27,361
Scroll back, please.

700
01:12:27,362 --> 01:12:29,713
To just after you lost your wingman.

701
01:12:33,470 --> 01:12:35,472
There. Play back, please.

702
01:12:39,277 --> 01:12:41,615
You took cover in the cloud...

703
01:12:42,314 --> 01:12:44,338
...you couldn't see anything...

704
01:12:44,339 --> 01:12:46,223
...so you must have been using your HUD.

705
01:12:46,224 --> 01:12:48,807
There! Stop!

706
01:12:50,134 --> 01:12:54,567
You saw something.
What did you see in your HUD?
Did you find a pattern?

707
01:12:54,567 --> 01:12:56,940
Very good, Ender.

708
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:05,191
Thermal imaging from the satellite.
The enemy is in red.

709
01:13:05,192 --> 01:13:07,041
What pattern do you see?

710
01:13:07,041 --> 01:13:11,300
It seems random...
But it's not.

711
01:13:12,138 --> 01:13:13,812
There's an epicenter.

712
01:13:13,813 --> 01:13:15,072
There!

713
01:13:15,316 --> 01:13:17,200
Really?

714
01:13:17,201 --> 01:13:20,354
You took out that one particular ship,
and the rest just...

715
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:22,622
...gave up?

716
01:13:22,623 --> 01:13:24,719
Why?

717
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:30,582
To what animals are the Formics most often compared?

718
01:13:30,583 --> 01:13:32,747
- Ants.
- Which have..?

719
01:13:33,201 --> 01:13:35,294
A queen...

720
01:13:35,295 --> 01:13:38,507
...who directs the worker ants.

721
01:13:39,588 --> 01:13:42,264
What she thinks, they do.

722
01:13:42,266 --> 01:13:44,115
Without her, they can't think for themselves...

723
01:13:44,116 --> 01:13:45,757
and they die!

724
01:13:45,758 --> 01:13:48,619
- You destroyed the Queen's ship...
- I must have, yes.

725
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:51,411
- But you can't be certain?
- No.

726
01:13:51,411 --> 01:13:54,623
The Soviet(???) Hegemon insisted
we keep it classified.

727
01:13:54,624 --> 01:13:56,788
That's why they never
showed the rest of the battle.

728
01:13:56,789 --> 01:13:59,475
Or my face.

729
01:13:59,475 --> 01:14:01,395
To the world, I'm dead.

730
01:14:01,396 --> 01:14:03,280
Colonel.

731
01:14:03,758 --> 01:14:05,223
Your face?

732
01:14:05,224 --> 01:14:08,436
You mean why is it marked?

733
01:14:09,762 --> 01:14:12,695
My father was a Maori...

734
01:14:12,904 --> 01:14:15,557
... Lost him in the war.

735
01:14:15,558 --> 01:14:20,865
'Tä moko'...
is a way to connect to my past,
to my inner skin.(???)

736
01:14:21,866 --> 01:14:25,369
It's a way for me to speak for the dead.

737
01:14:32,141 --> 01:14:33,188
Sir!

738
01:14:33,433 --> 01:14:36,015
- Have you ever seen a Queen?
- No. No one has.

739
01:14:36,016 --> 01:14:39,855
But if the Formics have rebuilt their
fleet, there must be more than one Queen.

740
01:14:39,856 --> 01:14:41,740
Yes, of course. (???)

741
01:14:41,741 --> 01:14:43,906
What happened when you attacked here?

742
01:14:44,465 --> 01:14:46,911
- Did you find one?
- No.

743
01:14:47,257 --> 01:14:48,862
Why did they come?

744
01:14:48,863 --> 01:14:50,853
Water.

745
01:15:10,121 --> 01:15:12,368
Attention!

746
01:15:13,974 --> 01:15:15,509
Officer on deck.

747
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:18,163
- Hey Bean.
- Ho Commander.

748
01:15:18,756 --> 01:15:19,629
Petra.

749
01:15:19,734 --> 01:15:22,771
We thought you were iced. We were
gonna have to have Dink take over...

750
01:15:22,772 --> 01:15:24,621
That was never gonna happen.

751
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:27,657
- Salaam, Alai.
- Salaam, Commander.

752
01:15:27,658 --> 01:15:29,752
- Bernard.
- Good to see you, sir.

753
01:15:30,346 --> 01:15:32,103
At ease.

754
01:15:32,104 --> 01:15:35,873
While you've been skinny-dipping,
the colonel's been flogging us to death on the simulator.

755
01:15:35,873 --> 01:15:37,932
Alright, take your seats.

756
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:43,938
In a matter of weeks, we may be called on to fight
a real battle. Let's bring your commander up to speed.

757
01:15:45,195 --> 01:15:49,663
Our latest probe images will give you an idea
of what's happening on the enemy planet.

758
01:15:57,099 --> 01:16:02,032
Like us, they appear to have a
population growth rate that's unsustainable.

759
01:16:02,033 --> 01:16:06,186
For now, they're contained on their planet.
But time is not on our side.

760
01:16:06,570 --> 01:16:08,176
Where are they?

761
01:16:08,385 --> 01:16:13,518
High surface temperatures limit their
above-ground activity to just a few hours a day.

762
01:16:14,425 --> 01:16:16,484
What's most alarming,...

763
01:16:16,485 --> 01:16:20,396
...is the rate at which their military power is expanding.

764
01:16:40,168 --> 01:16:42,854
But they've not yet moved against us?

765
01:16:42,854 --> 01:16:44,600
No.

766
01:16:47,043 --> 01:16:51,232
They're planning to colonize another planet,
before they breed themselves into extinction.

767
01:16:51,232 --> 01:16:54,619
Our orders are to defeat them before
they pose an irreversible threat.

768
01:16:55,037 --> 01:17:00,203
Their very existence is a threat.
Is that clear, Commander?

769
01:17:00,588 --> 01:17:03,345
- Clear, sir!
- Good.

770
01:17:03,346 --> 01:17:05,545
Carry on, Colonel!

771
01:17:07,535 --> 01:17:12,446
We will begin with fighter-real(???) simulations
that best approximate real battles.

772
01:17:12,447 --> 01:17:14,365
You will command overall strategy.

773
01:17:14,366 --> 01:17:17,962
Your toon leaders will each command a battle group.

774
01:17:18,485 --> 01:17:21,068
You will issue orders to them...

775
01:17:21,627 --> 01:17:25,676
...they will issue orders to their squadron to drone pilots.

776
01:17:58,676 --> 01:18:04,914
Finally, your entire fleet must support &
protect your most important asset...

777
01:18:05,915 --> 01:18:10,174
...$70 billion of pure destruction...

778
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:12,641
...the MD-500...

779
01:18:12,642 --> 01:18:15,783
...which Petra is trained to fire.

780
01:18:15,784 --> 01:18:19,099
- MD?
- Molecular Detachment device..

781
01:18:19,099 --> 01:18:20,857
...we call her the 'Little Doctor'.

782
01:18:21,275 --> 01:18:24,172
Particle beams accelerate
from her twin barrels...

783
01:18:24,173 --> 01:18:26,652
...At the focus point, they
reach critical effective mass.

784
01:18:26,653 --> 01:18:30,457
Chain reaction spreads outwards,
shattering molecular bonds.

785
01:18:30,457 --> 01:18:31,643
Leaves nothing standing.

786
01:18:31,644 --> 01:18:34,156
That's the beauty of the 'Little Doctor'.

787
01:18:34,157 --> 01:18:37,437
No need to identify the
specific ship of the Queen...

788
01:18:37,438 --> 01:18:40,152
...the chain reaction takes
out the entire swarm.

789
01:18:40,733 --> 01:18:43,699
But I'll only get one shot.

790
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:47,540
Once the Formics see how she works,
they won't come together again.

791
01:18:49,076 --> 01:18:53,299
You will have to win this
war, one battle at a time.

792
01:18:53,300 --> 01:19:00,488
Once our battle fleet is detected entering the Formic solar
system, we will have no alternative but to engage...

793
01:19:00,489 --> 01:19:02,643
...I trust we have chosen our Commander well.

794
01:19:02,644 --> 01:19:05,924
- There's greatness in him, sir.
- A killer instinct, too, I hope.

795
01:19:05,924 --> 01:19:07,915
Absolutely.

796
01:19:08,474 --> 01:19:13,362
Let's hope he's all you claim him to be.
We'll be with you soon.

797
01:19:13,376 --> 01:19:14,562
Good night.

798
01:19:15,025 --> 01:19:16,574
Good night, sir.

799
01:19:17,353 --> 01:19:18,923
"Dear Valentine,...

800
01:19:18,923 --> 01:19:21,925
...So this is Command School.
I'm finally here.

801
01:19:21,926 --> 01:19:25,171
Being a Third, I've always been so afraid I might fail...

802
01:19:25,172 --> 01:19:26,882
...that I might not measure up...

803
01:19:26,883 --> 01:19:28,488
They made me a leader.

804
01:19:28,489 --> 01:19:32,397
And I promise you that I'll do
everything I can to win this war.

805
01:19:32,398 --> 01:19:35,981
I know if anything ever happened to you,
I would never forgive myself."

806
01:19:35,982 --> 01:19:37,588
What are they doing?

807
01:19:37,589 --> 01:19:39,193
Harvesting water.

808
01:19:39,194 --> 01:19:40,930
If you're gonna use me,
I need to be closer.

809
01:19:40,931 --> 01:19:44,430
Too risky. Let's not reveal our best weapon
on what should be an easy attack.

810
01:19:44,431 --> 01:19:47,362
Alai, Bean!
Your droids peel away.

811
01:19:47,363 --> 01:19:49,923
Track them from below the ice
and read their path. (???)

812
01:19:55,079 --> 01:19:56,926
They're swarming.
They see us.

813
01:19:56,998 --> 01:20:02,409
Deploy all drones! Give me four
isobaric formations with 90 degree offsets!

814
01:20:10,824 --> 01:20:12,079
Open fire!

815
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:19,200
Alai! On my count, fire directly up into the ice!
Good strategem. (???)

816
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:26,915
...3... 2... 1.
Now!

817
01:20:43,615 --> 01:20:48,921
As our training progresses, the simulations
are becoming more and more complex, and real.

818
01:20:48,922 --> 01:20:52,726
The pressure to win, day after day...
month after month...is intense.

819
01:20:52,727 --> 01:20:54,541
We get very little sleep...

820
01:20:54,542 --> 01:20:56,147
...somedays it's hard to keep up.

821
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:58,171
- I got the breakaway!
- Great work, Bean.

822
01:20:58,171 --> 01:21:02,708
Squadrons 43 through 57, switch to 
quadrant Foxtrot 3889!

823
01:21:02,709 --> 01:21:05,014
Ender, watch our right flank.
We need backup for Bernard.

824
01:21:05,014 --> 01:21:05,537
I see it!

825
01:21:05,538 --> 01:21:08,329
- Bernard, you flank them.
- Copy that. Using 10 through 18.

826
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:10,116
Alai! To your right!

827
01:21:10,190 --> 01:21:14,064
Dink, compensate for the pull of
planet G8 and go full throttle!

828
01:21:14,065 --> 01:21:16,124
Bean, pop up and sync to 'Sierra'!(???)

829
01:21:16,125 --> 01:21:17,799
I could (???) 'Lima'!

830
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:21,080
Do 'Sierra' NOW! 
Bernard, watch your speed!

831
01:21:21,081 --> 01:21:23,349
Dink, you're closing too fast!

832
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:25,650
- You said full throttle!
- PULL BACK NOW, DINK!

833
01:21:32,597 --> 01:21:34,483
Gahh!

834
01:21:48,872 --> 01:21:53,130
You can't absorb these kind of losses! War isn't
a game where you get to reboot and start over!

835
01:21:53,131 --> 01:21:55,784
Sir, I can't win if I don't take any risks.

836
01:21:55,819 --> 01:21:57,355
Nobody's saying not to take risks...

837
01:21:57,355 --> 01:21:59,554
...just don't try and control everything.

838
01:21:59,555 --> 01:22:02,569
Bean improvised on the mop-ups, 
you focus on the big picture.

839
01:22:02,570 --> 01:22:04,593
Delegate more to your teams.

840
01:22:04,594 --> 01:22:06,099
My teams are burned out...

841
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:08,433
...how can they be effective
if they don't get any sleep?

842
01:22:08,434 --> 01:22:12,342
Sleep deprivation is part of your training.
A battle with the Formics could last for days!

843
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:17,230
If I'd been smarter, I could have annihilated Petra's
Little Doctor while you were micro-managing Bean.

844
01:22:17,231 --> 01:22:18,360
That can't happen, understand?

845
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:21,607
- Yes, sir.
- Do you?

846
01:22:22,025 --> 01:22:28,054
Cause I've trained others. Each one SO hopeful.
Each one ultimately a failure.

847
01:22:30,298 --> 01:22:34,209
Alright, Colonel.
He understands.

848
01:22:39,422 --> 01:22:42,390
- So I am not the first?
- No.

849
01:22:42,949 --> 01:22:45,776
But you will be the last.

850
01:22:46,439 --> 01:22:49,791
There is no time to train anyone else.

851
01:22:51,222 --> 01:22:55,899
So tomorrow Colonel Rackham
will run your final simulation.

852
01:22:56,423 --> 01:22:59,390
What if I win tomorrow? What happens?

853
01:22:59,390 --> 01:23:02,161
You'll be ready. To face the real enemy.

854
01:23:05,546 --> 01:23:09,631
And you'll be the finest commander 
we've ever trained.

855
01:23:16,718 --> 01:23:19,893
One more simulation,
then I may have to go to war.

856
01:23:19,894 --> 01:23:25,723
What happens when it's no longer a game?
Real war is different. I still know nothing about my enemy.

857
01:23:26,038 --> 01:23:27,922
What if they could talk to us?

858
01:23:27,922 --> 01:23:33,439
- They can't. Dissections show no vocal cords.
- There are other ways to communicate.

859
01:23:35,162 --> 01:23:38,198
Ender, this is not a conversation
we should be having at 1 a.m.

860
01:23:38,199 --> 01:23:42,108
What if they could 'think' to one another?

861
01:23:45,669 --> 01:23:47,344
What if we could 'think' to them?

862
01:23:47,344 --> 01:23:51,092
You need to sleep.
We've a graduation battle tomorrow.

863
01:23:53,802 --> 01:23:55,793
Right.

864
01:23:56,943 --> 01:24:00,714
- We're gonna get crushed.
- We won't get crushed. We have you.
  Now go to sleep.

865
01:24:00,714 --> 01:24:06,753
- Goodnight Petra.
- Goodnight Ender.

866
01:24:08,838 --> 01:24:11,177
You still think he's the one?

867
01:24:11,177 --> 01:24:17,460
We're committed. This boy has the
empathy to think like a Formic...

868
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:23,953
...understand them, and anticipate them.

869
01:24:29,573 --> 01:24:32,506
He's not ready.

870
01:24:33,519 --> 01:24:36,416
We're never ready.

871
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:41,338
You know when you're ready enough.

872
01:24:48,401 --> 01:24:52,765
Easy, sir!
It's Graduation Day.

873
01:25:02,029 --> 01:25:04,298
Good luck, sir!

874
01:25:10,476 --> 01:25:14,142
Attention!

875
01:25:15,922 --> 01:25:17,877
At ease!

876
01:25:18,401 --> 01:25:19,413
Sir?

877
01:25:19,902 --> 01:25:22,310
We have an audience.

878
01:25:23,217 --> 01:25:24,893
Commander Wiggin!

879
01:25:25,406 --> 01:25:29,489
The Strategos is here today to
witness your final simulation.

880
01:25:29,490 --> 01:25:36,379
If you are successful, he will endorse your
promotion to Battle Commander of the entire fleet!

881
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:37,217
Yes, sir!

882
01:25:37,218 --> 01:25:40,010
This simulation is based around
the enemy's home planet.

883
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:42,802
Good luck, Commander.

884
01:25:42,803 --> 01:25:44,582
Thank you, sir.

885
01:25:48,191 --> 01:25:49,727
Stay calm.

886
01:25:50,599 --> 01:25:52,310
Shoot straight.

887
01:25:53,986 --> 01:25:56,987
Here we go.

888
01:26:33,632 --> 01:26:37,575
- They're waiting.
- Maybe they think we come in peace.

889
01:26:37,576 --> 01:26:41,103
I don't think Mazer intends for
us to find a diplomatic solution.

890
01:26:46,547 --> 01:26:49,723
What's he waiting for?

891
01:26:49,724 --> 01:26:52,901
Just give him a minute.

892
01:26:54,018 --> 01:26:56,251
Ender, what do we do?

893
01:27:00,057 --> 01:27:01,768
Ender!

894
01:27:01,768 --> 01:27:06,621
The enemy's gate.. is down.

895
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:27,671
Petra, you're up.

896
01:27:27,672 --> 01:27:29,975
They're spread too wide
for a chain reaction.

897
01:27:29,975 --> 01:27:32,697
- She's right.
- Just let him follow his instinct.

898
01:27:32,699 --> 01:27:35,839
All Battle Groups, deploy
drones. Protect your carriers.

899
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:39,134
Alai, you're Squadron Five!
Engage!

900
01:27:49,804 --> 01:27:51,829
This is suicidal!

901
01:28:07,377 --> 01:28:10,797
Oh crap! They're swarming.

902
01:28:13,145 --> 01:28:14,566
Close enough for you now, Petra?

903
01:28:14,567 --> 01:28:16,871
Once I fire, I need time to recharge.

904
01:28:17,429 --> 01:28:19,418
Understood!

905
01:28:19,419 --> 01:28:21,408
Go for the center.

906
01:28:22,875 --> 01:28:24,445
Fire now!

907
01:28:47,789 --> 01:28:51,280
- Whoo! She did it!
- Yeah.

908
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:01,823
Give me full scalar (???)

909
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:11,311
We're not done yet.

910
01:29:11,412 --> 01:29:14,203
- But we are so screwed!
- No, we're not.

911
01:29:14,204 --> 01:29:16,333
- Charged, Petra?
- No. I need 2 minutes.

912
01:29:16,334 --> 01:29:19,580
- All fighters fall back and surround her ship.
- Copy that.

913
01:29:20,068 --> 01:29:24,122
I want rings within rings, layers
upon layer, every fighter we have.

914
01:29:29,506 --> 01:29:35,218
- Ender, you're gonna leave our transporters defenseless!
- If we're gonna win this battle, Dink, 
  it's all or nothing now!

915
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:39,501
When the outer layer is hit, the rest will continue
to drift with us like a shield. Do it now!

916
01:29:39,502 --> 01:29:42,119
He's abandoning his entire fleet!

917
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:45,017
He's in command.
There's no stopping him now!

918
01:29:45,171 --> 01:29:47,929
90 seconds, Ender!

919
01:29:57,423 --> 01:30:00,321
No, no, no! I'm losing my carriers!

920
01:30:00,426 --> 01:30:01,787
My dreadnoughts are out!

921
01:30:01,787 --> 01:30:03,880
I don't care about dreadnoughts!

922
01:30:03,881 --> 01:30:07,371
Just protect Petra!
Like we protected Alai when we fought Bonzo!

923
01:30:07,372 --> 01:30:08,524
I hope you know what you're doing.

924
01:30:08,524 --> 01:30:11,771
- Ready, Petra?
- 60 seconds! What am I aiming for?

925
01:30:15,436 --> 01:30:17,391
The planet.

926
01:30:17,601 --> 01:30:18,472
What?

927
01:30:18,473 --> 01:30:23,360
We destroy the planet,
we destroy the queens.

928
01:30:23,361 --> 01:30:24,303
Game Over.

929
01:30:24,304 --> 01:30:27,200
Ender, my targeting sensor needs a clear line of sight!

930
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:28,736
We will clear a path.

931
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:33,379
All fighters maintain a clockwise rotation.
Focus all firepower forward.

932
01:30:43,479 --> 01:30:46,690
- Ender, we're entering the atmosphere!
- We need to slow down!

933
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:48,205
We can't! We're one unit now!

934
01:30:48,206 --> 01:30:50,879
We're not equipped to handle the heat
of passing through an atmosphere!

935
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:55,628
Our drones are our heat shield!
Keep falling. Let gravity do the work!

936
01:31:06,276 --> 01:31:08,475
This shield won't hold forever!

937
01:31:08,476 --> 01:31:10,396
We don't NEED forever!

938
01:31:11,513 --> 01:31:14,479
30 seconds!
I still don't have a clear shot.

939
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:15,351
We're burning up!

940
01:31:15,352 --> 01:31:20,308
Bean, on my count, accelerate the fighters from
the nose of the formation in a continuous stream.

941
01:31:20,309 --> 01:31:24,185
- Yes, sir!
- Like bullets from a rifle, 
  you will clear a visual for Petra!

942
01:31:24,301 --> 01:31:26,187
We will drill a hole through the swarm.

943
01:31:26,188 --> 01:31:28,770
- Petra, you'll only get a second.
- That's all I need.

944
01:31:28,770 --> 01:31:32,994
... 3... 2... 1
Now, Bean!

945
01:31:52,206 --> 01:31:56,708
Shields have reached at 5%! (???)

946
01:31:56,709 --> 01:31:58,000
Now, Petra!
Now!

947
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,549
- 10 seconds!
- They've broken the shield!

948
01:32:02,679 --> 01:32:05,123
Fire Petra!
We're out of time!

949
01:32:48,470 --> 01:32:51,402
We did it!

950
01:33:02,153 --> 01:33:04,527
How about that?

951
01:33:07,774 --> 01:33:10,357
Game over!

952
01:33:18,316 --> 01:33:21,528
What's he saying?

953
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:26,695
Restoring the ansible connection.

954
01:34:01,592 --> 01:34:03,721
What is this?

955
01:34:04,734 --> 01:34:08,155
Why are we watching these images?

956
01:34:16,173 --> 01:34:18,058
Ender.

957
01:34:19,071 --> 01:34:21,235
Thank you!

958
01:34:21,236 --> 01:34:25,716
Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant!
Thank God for you, son!

959
01:34:26,216 --> 01:34:29,322
Why are these images
in the program?

960
01:34:29,323 --> 01:34:31,021
Ender...

961
01:34:31,022 --> 01:34:33,640
...we won!

962
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,340
What do you mean, 'we won'?

963
01:34:38,003 --> 01:34:40,237
I beat him!!

964
01:34:40,238 --> 01:34:43,796
He runs the simulations!
He said it was a game!

965
01:34:43,996 --> 01:34:48,326
It was them or us, Ender.
There was no other way.

966
01:34:49,023 --> 01:34:51,850
With this victory...

967
01:34:51,851 --> 01:34:54,573
...you've won all future battles.

968
01:34:54,574 --> 01:35:00,229
You destroyed them...for all of us!

969
01:35:22,254 --> 01:35:26,054
<i>- Stand down. 
- Move! Move! Please! Move!
- Make way.</i>

970
01:35:31,279 --> 01:35:33,279
- Ender...
- STAY AWAY FROM ME!

971
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:34,305
You lied!

972
01:35:34,305 --> 01:35:38,055
- Son, we were afraid if we told you, you'd..
- What? Refuse to play?

973
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:40,830
- They attacked us 1st... (???)
- NO! They waited!

974
01:35:40,855 --> 01:35:43,855
- What were they waiting for?
- Who.. CARES?!

975
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:46,880
We lost a thousand men on the
transporters you abandoned.

976
01:35:46,881 --> 01:35:48,881
I abandoned them in order to win!

977
01:35:48,882 --> 01:35:54,882
- YES!.. And they died proudly for US!
- They might not have died at all!

978
01:36:01,007 --> 01:36:04,107
- If I'd known it was real, I would've...
- What? Called for a dialogue?

979
01:36:04,108 --> 01:36:06,608
- They can't even speak.
- ...watched them!

980
01:36:06,609 --> 01:36:10,609
What were they thinking? Were they building an army for a second invasion?

981
01:36:10,610 --> 01:36:14,610
- Or..or simply preparing to defend themselves...
- Ender, stop. -...from us!

982
01:36:16,235 --> 01:36:20,735
They came to Earth to establish a colony.
We chased them away.

983
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:23,786
- And in <i>fifty years</i>, they never returned!
- It makes no difference now.

984
01:36:23,787 --> 01:36:26,787
I will bear the shame 
of this genocide, forever!

985
01:36:26,810 --> 01:36:32,610
- No! You will be remembered as a hero.
- I WILL BE REMEMBERED AS A KILLER!

986
01:36:32,835 --> 01:36:36,635
- It was us or them.
- And you're sure we've killed every last one of them?

987
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:38,360
I saw their whole planet destroyed.

988
01:36:38,385 --> 01:36:41,385
How do you know there isn't another
colony or another Queen out there?

989
01:36:41,410 --> 01:36:46,310
- (???)We WON! That's all that matters.
- No!

990
01:36:47,835 --> 01:36:51,335
The way, we win, matters.

991
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:00,960
Don't hurt him.

992
01:37:24,282 --> 01:37:26,782
- Go on. You need to let him rest.
- Can I stay with him?

993
01:37:30,108 --> 01:37:31,808
Just so he's not alone...

994
01:37:31,934 --> 01:37:33,260
Please...

995
01:37:34,518 --> 01:37:38,322
Yes, of course...

996
01:37:50,505 --> 01:37:54,905
C'mon! Let's let him rest.

997
01:38:10,682 --> 01:38:13,999
...What if they could talk to us...

998
01:38:17,292 --> 01:38:20,329
...what were they thinking...

999
01:38:25,136 --> 01:38:27,405
Valentine!

1000
01:38:31,478 --> 01:38:34,131
...What if we could think to them...

1001
01:38:38,739 --> 01:38:41,614
- Valentine!
- Ender!

1002
01:38:41,639 --> 01:38:43,636
Ender, wait!

1003
01:38:43,637 --> 01:38:45,696
Ender!

1004
01:38:45,697 --> 01:38:48,630
What are you doing, Ender?

1005
01:38:48,630 --> 01:38:51,773
- I know what she wants!
- Ender?

1006
01:38:51,774 --> 01:38:54,974
<i>#Warning! You are leaving an oxygen - balanced environment!(???) #</i>

1007
01:38:55,019 --> 01:38:58,404
Ender, stop!

1008
01:38:58,405 --> 01:39:02,210
It's not safe!
Ender!

1009
01:39:08,436 --> 01:39:11,438
Breathe. Just breathe.

1010
01:39:21,516 --> 01:39:26,053
In my game, I saw this place.

1011
01:39:26,053 --> 01:39:27,484
What are you talking about?

1012
01:39:27,485 --> 01:39:31,079
The Formics accessed the game through me.

1013
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:34,781
Their thoughts, my dreams, 
all mixed together.

1014
01:39:37,946 --> 01:39:41,472
They were trying to communicate.

1015
01:39:41,821 --> 01:39:43,845
What are you doing?

1016
01:39:45,569 --> 01:39:47,104
Go back.

1017
01:39:47,662 --> 01:39:48,814
No!

1018
01:39:48,815 --> 01:39:52,655
Please!
I have to do this.

1019
01:40:26,099 --> 01:40:27,566
"Dear Valentine,

1020
01:40:28,053 --> 01:40:31,229
...I now know my dreams
were never my own.

1021
01:40:31,230 --> 01:40:33,359
They came from her.

1022
01:40:33,429 --> 01:40:36,096
She was always trying 
to communicate with me.

1023
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:39,527
I know the Formics
better than any living soul.

1024
01:40:40,085 --> 01:40:43,401
I stole their future from them.

1025
01:40:43,402 --> 01:40:47,206
Now I must find a way to make amends."

1026
01:43:21,089 --> 01:43:23,126
You're dying.

1027
01:43:39,335 --> 01:43:42,581
Is it a Queen?

1028
01:44:02,841 --> 01:44:07,588
I'll find her a new home.

1029
01:44:12,104 --> 01:44:14,862
I promise.

1030
01:44:28,349 --> 01:44:30,687
"I miss you, Valentine.

1031
01:44:31,211 --> 01:44:34,074
You won't be hearing from me for a while.

1032
01:44:40,951 --> 01:44:45,630
I need to find out if I'm 
as gifted at peace as I am at war.

1033
01:44:46,746 --> 01:44:50,927
They've rewarded me the rank of Admiral
and left me to my own devices...

1034
01:44:50,928 --> 01:44:53,128
...which suits me fine.

1035
01:44:53,496 --> 01:44:57,510
I'll travel the universe and
carry with me, a precious cargo.

1036
01:44:58,208 --> 01:45:01,281
Because I have a promise to keep."

1037
