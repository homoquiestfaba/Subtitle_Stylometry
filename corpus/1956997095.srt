Woman:It's still

10
00:01:29,584 --> 00:01:30,919
my favorite animal.

11
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:32,795
You draggedthis old bear around

12
00:01:32,795 --> 00:01:34,839
till most of the stuffingfell out.

13
00:01:34,839 --> 00:01:37,216
Maybe he's skinnierbut I still have it.

14
00:01:37,216 --> 00:01:40,385
Till mostyou know whatingfell out.Else I have?

15
00:01:40,385 --> 00:01:43,887
Maybe hthe best dadbin the whole world.

16
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:46,974
Till mostyou know whatingi'm going to miss you, Jen.

17
00:01:47,015 --> 00:01:49,725
I'm going to missyou, too, dad.

18
00:01:58,525 --> 00:02:01,235
Oh, it's hard to believeit's been 16 years

19
00:02:01,277 --> 00:02:03,154
since we movedinto this house.

20
00:02:03,195 --> 00:02:04,655
The strange thing is

21
00:02:04,655 --> 00:02:06,656
we thought whenwe were moving in

22
00:02:06,656 --> 00:02:08,575
we would betaking care of Mary.

23
00:02:08,616 --> 00:02:11,202
It turned out she wastaking care of us.

24
00:02:11,244 --> 00:02:13,745
I don't remembera lot about Mary.

25
00:02:13,787 --> 00:02:16,832
Just how much I loved itwhen she used to read to me.

26
00:02:16,832 --> 00:02:19,167
She loved it evenmore than you did.

27
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,461
That's why sheleft us this house.

28
00:02:21,502 --> 00:02:24,421
So you couldgrow up here and...

29
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:27,048
One day getmarried here.

30
00:02:28,007 --> 00:02:29,925
So you couldjust before she died...

31
00:02:32,136 --> 00:02:35,513
Mary asked meto save this.

32
00:02:35,513 --> 00:02:37,724
For you.

33
00:02:43,187 --> 00:02:45,188
Oh, dad, it's so beautiful.

34
00:02:45,188 --> 00:02:47,023
She wanted youto have it

35
00:02:47,023 --> 00:02:48,900
on your wedding day.

36
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,193
I wonder how sheted youmetherhusband.Ve it

37
00:02:51,193 --> 00:02:53,111
you never knew anythingabout davidon your wedding day.

38
00:02:53,153 --> 00:02:54,279
Did you, dad?

39
00:02:54,321 --> 00:02:57,239
No, just fromthat portraitup in the attic.

40
00:02:57,281 --> 00:03:00,409
But their love storywas... amazing.

41
00:03:00,451 --> 00:03:02,869
They met duringthe second world war.

42
00:03:02,911 --> 00:03:04,746
The company that David owned

43
00:03:04,787 --> 00:03:08,081
had just won a contratto build a stock plane engie

44
00:03:08,123 --> 00:03:09,625
for the U.S. arm.

45
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,169
So, naturally,he was working around the clock

46
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,795
to methis production deadlin.

47
00:03:14,837 --> 00:03:16,005
Look, boss...

48
00:03:16,047 --> 00:03:17,089
Yeah.

49
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:18,423
I know you're busy

50
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:21,134
but we got to do somethingabout the bottleneck.

51
00:03:21,176 --> 00:03:23,427
We're designingthe finishing operation

52
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:24,678
to solve that.

53
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,139
You'll have the newgrinders by next week.

54
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:28,682
Great.

55
00:03:53,077 --> 00:03:54,453
Oh, excuse me, sir.

56
00:03:54,495 --> 00:03:57,372
Where do I go to applyfor the secretarial position?

57
00:03:57,413 --> 00:03:59,916

58
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,501

59
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,085

because he wanted to finda new life over here

120
00:06:15,902 --> 00:06:18,404
but with jobs so scarceduring the depression

121
00:06:18,404 --> 00:06:20,781
he never really could findsteady work.

122
00:06:20,822 --> 00:06:22,032
But with jobs so scarceduring thi understand.

123
00:06:22,074 --> 00:06:24,785
Unfortunately,my father wasa failure too.

124
00:06:24,826 --> 00:06:27,370
I don't consider my fatherto be a failure

125
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,913

Oh, and the tank arsenalis stepping up its production.

158
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,643
So to match it

159
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,438
we'll have to be adding2,000 more units a week.

160
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,190
Hey, you betterget out of here.

161
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,316

with all these clocksaround here.

165
00:08:50,737 --> 00:08:52,280
I know the pressureyou're under

166
00:08:52,322 --> 00:08:54,199

167
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,532

00:09:01,996 --> 00:09:02,997
Miss Chandler.Hmm?

173
00:09:02,997 --> 00:09:05,500

174
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:08,168
You're alreadytoo fond of her, Dave.

175
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,836
I'm not "fond" of her.

176
00:09:09,836 --> 00:09:13,255
I just admireher competence and efficiency.

177
00:09:13,297 --> 00:09:15,216
Are you sureit's her work ethic

178
00:09:15,257 --> 00:09:16,509
that you admire?

179
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:19,677
It's not like you to haveyour head turned by a woman.

180
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:22,721
I just want to make sureshe makes the last bus.

181
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,932
And besides, this womanis different.

182
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:27,017

218
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:45,464

Should I holdall your calls?

242
00:12:38,173 --> 00:12:39,841

Should I holdthank you.L your calls?

244
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:43,594
All right...

245
00:12:43,636 --> 00:12:46,847
What are you goingto tempt me with today?

246
00:12:49,641 --> 00:12:53,352
The owner...Wants $200 for it.

247
00:12:53,352 --> 00:12:55,896
I'd offer him one.

248
00:12:57,815 --> 00:13:00,066
The owner...Interested?200 for it.

249
00:13:00,983 --> 00:13:02,777
It's a beautiful piece...

250
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:04,194
But it's a woman's watch.

251
00:13:04,236 --> 00:13:05,696
What would I do with it?

252
00:13:05,696 --> 00:13:07,030
It's ararepiece.

253
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,198
But you're right.

254
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,824
It is a kind of gift

255
00:13:09,865 --> 00:13:11,909
a man would givehis sweetheart.

256
00:13:11,909 --> 00:13:15,787
If a manhada sweetheart, right?

257
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,707
Do you ever think man would giveabout getting married?Weetheart.

258
00:13:18,707 --> 00:13:19,916
Not really.

259
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:23,585
Do you ever thinki guess I neverabout gettinfound the right one.

260
00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:26,629
Take a lookat our new grinder design.

261
00:13:26,671 --> 00:13:29,882
We've got to cutki guess I neverproduction time in halfight one.

262
00:13:29,924 --> 00:13:32,426
Without affectingour quality.

263
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:34,594
Hmm.

264
00:13:34,636 --> 00:13:37,221
You could set the axisof the cutter

265
00:13:37,221 --> 00:13:39,515
at just a hairmore of an angle.

266
00:13:39,557 --> 00:13:42,434
Yeah. That would improveprofile accuracy.

267
00:13:42,475 --> 00:13:43,935
Why didn't I see that?

268
00:13:43,977 --> 00:13:46,521
You would haveif those Washington people

269
00:13:46,563 --> 00:13:49,314
would give you enough timeto take a deep breath.

270
00:13:49,356 --> 00:13:50,774
Well, I'd best be going

271
00:13:50,774 --> 00:13:53,359
so you can get backto winning the war.

272
00:13:53,401 --> 00:13:55,278
The war will go onwell, I'd best bewithout me.

273
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:57,238
Always time for you,lawrence.

274
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,573
Be good to yourself.

276
00:14:00,032 --> 00:14:01,074
Yeah.

277
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:02,242

Make sure he doesn't work youto the bonenowing

281
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:09,873
like he does himself.

282
00:14:09,914 --> 00:14:11,791
I'll try not to,mr. Flynn.

283
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,626

292
00:14:41,107 --> 00:14:42,108
I was just wondering

293
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,026
if that bavarian clockwas ready.

294
00:14:44,068 --> 00:14:45,152
Yes, indeed.

295
00:14:45,194 --> 00:14:46,278
Sit down, please.

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,988
Thanks, althoughi don't know

297
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,280
why I bother to ask.

298
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:50,740
It doesn't matter, really.

299
00:14:50,782 --> 00:14:52,784
It's just goodto get out and about

300
00:14:52,784 --> 00:14:54,117
while I still can.

301
00:14:54,117 --> 00:14:55,285

Anything wrong?

307
00:15:06,544 --> 00:15:09,047
Um... the doctor just told me

308
00:15:09,088 --> 00:15:11,965

309
00:15:11,965 --> 00:15:13,592

00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:43,825
Cal Avery.

323
00:15:43,825 --> 00:15:45,785
It worries me.

324
00:15:45,827 --> 00:15:48,579
If I'd known, I could havesaved you the trouble

325
00:15:48,621 --> 00:15:50,330

I don't want that taxirunning up the meter on you.

328
00:15:59,964 --> 00:16:03,216
I thinkyou'll like the chimes now.

I know I will.

330
00:16:05,093 --> 00:16:07,135
But... if there's any problem...

331
00:16:07,135 --> 00:16:09,138

00:17:26,034 --> 00:17:29,077
Sorry if I seemed uncomfortablein there.

365
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,996
Never been very religious.

366
00:17:30,996 --> 00:17:33,123
You don't have to bevery religious

367
00:17:33,165 --> 00:17:34,540
to talk to God.N very religious.

368
00:17:34,582 --> 00:17:35,625
That's just it.

369
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,044
I don't even knowif there is a God.

370
00:17:38,085 --> 00:17:40,921
I guess I'm too muchof a cynic.

371
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:43,006
You said your fatherwas a failure.

372
00:17:43,048 --> 00:17:44,799
Is that whatmade you cynical?

373
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,593
I-I probably shouldn'thave said that.

374
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:50,262
Is that whatmy father was reallymade you cynicala wonderful man.

375
00:17:50,262 --> 00:17:54,390
Unfortunately,he let my mother destroy him.

376
00:17:54,432 --> 00:17:55,934
Is that whatmy father was reallywhat do you mean? Wonderful man.

377
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:59,061
She walked out on uswhen I was four.

378
00:17:59,061 --> 00:18:00,938
He never got over it.

379
00:18:00,938 --> 00:18:02,688
She walked out on usdid he never remarry?I was four.

380
00:18:02,688 --> 00:18:05,566
No. It was justthe two of us.

381
00:18:05,608 --> 00:18:07,525
I guess I turned out on usdid he neveall right.I was four.

382
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:09,277
(Chuckling)

383
00:18:09,277 --> 00:18:10,445
But...

384
00:18:10,445 --> 00:18:14,114
A child really shouldhave two parents.

385
00:18:14,114 --> 00:18:15,783
I admire your faith.

386
00:18:15,783 --> 00:18:18,077
I wish I had it.

387
00:18:18,118 --> 00:18:21,246
There's no real wayto explain faith.

388
00:18:21,287 --> 00:18:22,956
All I know is that

389
00:18:22,997 --> 00:18:26,708
sometimes godis the only friend you have.

390
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:32,421
The whole idea of a deityi find incomprehensible.

391
00:18:32,463 --> 00:18:33,798
But a clock...

392
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:35,882
Nowthati understand.

393
00:18:35,924 --> 00:18:38,134
A clock I can see,I can touch

394
00:18:38,176 --> 00:18:40,262
I can eventake it apart

395
00:18:40,262 --> 00:18:42,346
discoverits mysteries--

396
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:44,932
I cthen have lawrencetaput it back together.

397
00:18:44,974 --> 00:18:46,432
(Chuckling)

398
00:18:46,474 --> 00:18:47,642
I don't know.

399
00:18:47,642 --> 00:18:49,018
This is my place.

400
00:18:49,018 --> 00:18:50,311
Oh.

401
00:18:50,353 --> 00:18:53,981
I'll see you in the morning.

402
00:18:54,022 --> 00:18:58,651
Hey... y-you...You don't get away that easy.

403
00:18:58,651 --> 00:19:02,488
I mean, at least, not untili tell you what a, uh...

404
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,322
Hey... y-you...Special night this was. Easy.

405
00:19:04,364 --> 00:19:05,824
Not once--

406
00:19:05,865 --> 00:19:08,325
not one single,solitary momentdid I think...

407
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:09,618
(Door closing)

408
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,955
...about the planor the war production board

409
00:19:13,997 --> 00:19:16,499
or cost overruns, or...

410
00:19:16,499 --> 00:19:18,418
Good evening.

411
00:19:22,254 --> 00:19:24,880
All I thought about was...

412
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,092
You...

413
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:30,011
And...

414
00:19:30,052 --> 00:19:32,887
God, I mean,it's...

415
00:19:35,348 --> 00:19:37,349
Thank you.

416
00:19:43,104 --> 00:19:44,731
Good night.

417
00:19:44,772 --> 00:19:46,357
Good night.

418
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,259
Where's David?

419
00:20:20,301 --> 00:20:22,178
He'll be backin a moment.

420
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,186
What are you doingstill working?

421
00:20:31,226 --> 00:20:33,562
You're supposed to bedown at the dance.

422
00:20:33,562 --> 00:20:36,190
Oh, I didn't thinkanyone would miss me.

423
00:20:36,231 --> 00:20:37,356
Imissed yo.

424
00:20:37,398 --> 00:20:40,401
You know, you have beenas remote as mount Everest

425
00:20:40,401 --> 00:20:41,527
for the last week

426
00:20:41,569 --> 00:20:44,112
but you're notgetting out ofat least one dance

427
00:20:44,154 --> 00:20:45,655

428
00:20:47,449 --> 00:20:49,909
Well, I'll be downa little later.

429
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:51,786
I'll be waiting.

430
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:13,720
Men have been knownto fight wars

431
00:21:13,762 --> 00:21:16,972
for the privilegeof holding me in their arms

432
00:21:17,014 --> 00:21:18,557
and all you had to do

433
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:21,309
was give us the placefor our charity dance.

434
00:21:26,563 --> 00:21:28,607

435
00:21:46,622 --> 00:21:48,541

David,I'll save the last dance.

437
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,593
You work too hard,mary Chandler.

438

(Music stopsand dancers applaud)

443
00:23:32,209 --> 00:23:33,460

445
00:23:36,045 --> 00:23:37,880

446
00:23:37,922 --> 00:23:40,048
I respect you too much

447
00:23:40,048 --> 00:23:43,801
to ever do anythingthat would hurt you in any way.

448
00:23:43,843 --> 00:23:45,761
If that's whyyou've been so... much

449
00:23:45,761 --> 00:23:48,847
no, it's...It's not that at all.

450
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:52,850
If that's whyyou've beenyou don't understand.

451
00:23:52,892 --> 00:23:54,936
Idounderstand.

452
00:23:54,977 --> 00:23:58,730
What we felt for each otheras we danced...

453
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,315
Was real.

454
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,401
What we felt for each otheri'm in love with you.

455
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,529
I'm in love with you.

456
00:24:14,826 --> 00:24:16,119
I'm sorry.

457
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:17,496
Sorry?

458
00:24:17,537 --> 00:24:19,247
It'swonderful.

459
00:24:19,247 --> 00:24:21,999
It's impossible.

460
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:25,377
David,I should have told you.

461
00:24:25,377 --> 00:24:27,921
It's imposthere's somebody else?

462
00:24:27,921 --> 00:24:30,172
David,I should have told yowhat, then?

463
00:24:33,133 --> 00:24:36,511
It's impomary... what?Body else?

464
00:24:40,806 --> 00:24:43,267
I'm pregnant, David.

465
00:24:44,768 --> 00:24:46,394
There was...

466
00:24:47,436 --> 00:24:49,230
Someone...

467
00:24:49,272 --> 00:24:51,773
A soldier and...

468
00:24:51,815 --> 00:24:54,025
And I was foolish.

469
00:24:56,152 --> 00:24:58,028
Does he know?

470
00:25:00,197 --> 00:25:03,074
He was killed...

471
00:25:03,116 --> 00:25:06,369
Five weeks ago in Italy...

472
00:25:06,411 --> 00:25:09,079
And that's why I came here.

473
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:13,499
To get a new start.

474
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:17,295
I should have told you,but I really needed this job.

475
00:25:17,295 --> 00:25:22,507
David, I'll never forgive myselffor deceiving you.

476
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:24,800
You're the last personin the world

477
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,302
I'd ever want to hurt.

478
00:25:26,343 --> 00:25:28,846
David, there'st persona phone call.

479
00:25:30,305 --> 00:25:32,348
I'll have to call them back.

480
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,474
It's urgent.

481
00:25:33,474 --> 00:25:35,767
I said I'dcall him back.

482
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:38,353
David,it's Washington.

483
00:25:43,816 --> 00:25:46,443
Mary... wait here.

484
00:25:46,484 --> 00:25:48,653

485
00:25:48,695 --> 00:25:51,197
All right?

486
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:52,906

00:26:03,206 --> 00:26:04,750
David:I know that, Bob

489
00:26:07,252 --> 00:26:11,255
Look, Bob... Bob, why can't wedo this over the phone?

490
00:26:11,297 --> 00:26:12,965
I know it's important

491
00:26:13,007 --> 00:26:16,092
but I have a priorityof my own right here, now.

492
00:26:16,134 --> 00:26:17,344

David, you look frantic.

503
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:56,042
Have you seen Mary?

504
00:26:56,084 --> 00:26:59,252
Well, that poor girlran out of here in tears.

505
00:26:59,252 --> 00:27:02,130

Where arei have to go.

510
00:27:28,902 --> 00:27:29,903
You can't leave.

Listi don't know where I belong.

516
00:27:37,367 --> 00:27:38,576
When I couldn't find you

517
00:27:38,618 --> 00:27:41,079
and I thought I mightnever see you again

518
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:44,415

Why would you everwant to marry me?

524

It doesn't matter, Mary.

525
00:28:01,095 --> 00:28:02,346
It doesn't matter.

526
00:28:02,388 --> 00:28:05,014
I'm asking you to marry me.

527
00:28:06,266 --> 00:28:08,101
I don't want your pity.

528

It's not about pity.

It's about love. Want your pity.

530
00:28:12,521 --> 00:28:14,815
I can't do that to you.

531

What would people think?

532
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,986
Mary...

Lawrence,you would not believe

562
00:30:07,365 --> 00:30:08,825
what I'm here for.

563
00:30:08,866 --> 00:30:10,701
That rose-gold woman's watch

564
00:30:10,701 --> 00:30:12,994
you said you hadno need for.

565
00:30:13,036 --> 00:30:16,623
You know, I...I have always suspected you

566
00:30:16,665 --> 00:30:18,582
of being a mind reader.

567
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,668
And you foundthe right woman

568
00:30:20,709 --> 00:30:21,752
right, Mr. p.?

569
00:30:21,794 --> 00:30:23,294
Miss Chandler,isn't it?

570
00:30:23,336 --> 00:30:25,213
Well, I, I can't believe it.

571
00:30:25,255 --> 00:30:28,173
I hire a girlto straighten out my files.

572
00:30:28,215 --> 00:30:31,385
I find the onlywomanwho can straighten out my life.

573
00:30:31,385 --> 00:30:34,262
I knew it when I firstsaw you two together.

574
00:30:34,303 --> 00:30:36,639
I'm very happyfor you, Mr. p.

575
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:37,974

576
00:30:38,015 --> 00:30:38,975
Thank you.

577
00:30:39,016 --> 00:30:41,893
It's all going to bein a bit of a rush

578
00:30:41,893 --> 00:30:43,728
so you won't getyour invitation

579
00:30:43,728 --> 00:30:45,896
until just a few daysbefore the wedding.

580
00:30:45,938 --> 00:30:48,148
Are you sureso you won't getyou want me there?Our invitation

581
00:30:49,275 --> 00:30:52,402
you know betterthan to even askthat question.

582
00:30:55,779 --> 00:30:56,905
What's this?

583
00:30:56,905 --> 00:30:58,407
A new acquisition?

584
00:30:58,407 --> 00:30:59,992
No clock.

585
00:31:00,033 --> 00:31:01,450
That's my angel.

586
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:03,160
Your angel?

587
00:31:03,202 --> 00:31:04,161
Yes.

588
00:31:04,203 --> 00:31:06,247
I thought I'droll it out

589
00:31:06,247 --> 00:31:08,331
so I could see it.

590
00:31:12,626 --> 00:31:13,919
It's beautiful.

591
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,254
Where'd you find it?

592
00:31:15,296 --> 00:31:16,547
It found me.

593
00:31:16,589 --> 00:31:19,632
I spent most of the summerrepairing the steeple clock

594
00:31:19,674 --> 00:31:21,426
and apparentlythe church treasurer

595
00:31:21,467 --> 00:31:23,303
ran off with the building money

596
00:31:23,343 --> 00:31:24,761
so the minister asked me

597
00:31:24,761 --> 00:31:26,847
if I'd take that insteadfor payment.

598
00:31:26,889 --> 00:31:28,140
(Both chuckling)

599
00:31:28,181 --> 00:31:31,517
I was tempted to sell itonce during the depression.

600
00:31:31,517 --> 00:31:34,061
But now, I'mkind of glad I didn't.

601
00:31:34,103 --> 00:31:38,106
I'm going to have that putell iton my grave after I'm gonession.

602
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:40,524
So that people around herewill know

603
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:42,610
that I was worthsomething.

604
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:48,114
Minister:Will thou, David,take Mary as your wife

605
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:50,783

(Laughs)

624
00:32:46,286 --> 00:32:48,872
Those whom godhath joined together

625
00:32:48,914 --> 00:32:51,458
let no man put asunder.

626
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:53,376

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,875

730
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:08,042
in the birth canal.

731
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:10,211

(Whistling)

767
00:39:08,641 --> 00:39:10,977
Let's paint it red.

768
00:39:10,977 --> 00:39:13,895
Oh, no, missy.

769
00:39:13,895 --> 00:39:15,563
Birds don't like bright colors..

770
00:39:15,605 --> 00:39:18,024
You'll scare them away.

771
00:39:18,066 --> 00:39:21,026
When are theygoing to come?

772
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:22,653
It takes some time.

773
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:25,196
You see, birds...

774
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:27,615
Here.Kes some time.

775
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,284
Birds are suspicious...

776
00:39:30,325 --> 00:39:32,160
Like some people.E.

777
00:39:32,202 --> 00:39:33,912
What's suspicious?

778
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,997
(Laughing)

779
00:39:35,997 --> 00:39:40,209
Well, it means havinga lot of questions like you.

780
00:39:40,209 --> 00:39:41,751

785

Well...

786
00:39:53,261 --> 00:39:55,513
Because God made them that way.

787
00:39:55,555 --> 00:39:57,806
Is that why yourskin's brown?

788
00:39:57,848 --> 00:39:59,599
My skin?

789
00:39:59,641 --> 00:40:00,726
Yeah.

790
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:03,561
That's right, missy--

791
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:06,981
because God made it that way.

792
00:40:11,234 --> 00:40:12,152
Hey!

793
00:40:12,193 --> 00:40:13,486

You're welcome.

800
00:40:22,368 --> 00:40:23,870
Was the trip successful?

801
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,037
I'd say hopeful.

802
00:40:25,037 --> 00:40:26,204
I missed my girls.

803
00:40:26,246 --> 00:40:28,206
I wish I could'vegotten home sooner.

804
00:40:28,248 --> 00:40:29,499
Well, you did your best

805
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:31,917

00:40:31,959 --> 00:40:33,919
What's that?

807
00:40:33,961 --> 00:40:35,504

00:40:35,504 --> 00:40:37,505

Don't leave.

00:40:55,228 --> 00:40:56,730
Time to go to sleep.

818
00:40:56,772 --> 00:40:58,939
Stay justa little longer.

819
00:40:58,981 --> 00:41:00,149

all the time?

825
00:41:08,907 --> 00:41:12,785
Because daddy has to findnew customers for his business.

827
00:41:15,536 --> 00:41:18,164

Mary:What's the maoh...

832
00:41:51,358 --> 00:41:54,443
I guessi'm just feeling guilty

833
00:41:54,443 --> 00:41:57,530
Mary:About being away so much and...

834
00:42:00,073 --> 00:42:02,617

835
00:42:02,617 --> 00:42:07,037
we have to tell andreai'm not her real father.

836
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:10,498
Oh, David, you areher real father.

837
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,500
Being a fatherdoesn't happen

838
00:42:12,542 --> 00:42:14,585
at the momentof conception.

839
00:42:14,585 --> 00:42:17,295

I've failed you,haven't I?

844
00:42:28,972 --> 00:42:31,349
Mary,it's not about that.

845
00:42:31,391 --> 00:42:35,477
If only I could have given youyour own child.

846
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,312
I couldn't love Andrea more

847
00:42:37,312 --> 00:42:39,564
if she wasmy own flesh and blood.

848
00:42:39,605 --> 00:42:40,815
You know that.

849
00:42:40,815 --> 00:42:42,942

901
00:45:59,311 --> 00:46:01,938
when this angel camethrough the window

902
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:03,814
and took her from me.

903
00:46:03,814 --> 00:46:05,524
Oh, honey.

904
00:46:05,566 --> 00:46:08,109
It was just a dream.

I have to see her, David.

906
00:46:10,486 --> 00:46:12,113

How bad is it?

930
00:47:41,727 --> 00:47:44,897

It can't come true.

946
00:48:24,054 --> 00:48:26,180
I won't let it.

947
00:48:33,019 --> 00:48:36,022
(Clocks ticking)

950
00:48:43,945 --> 00:48:45,155

Miss maud knows that clockwon't be ready till next week.

959
00:49:04,587 --> 00:49:08,090
Now, if you fellows are thinkingabout selling miss maud's clock

960
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:09,633

00:50:06,429 --> 00:50:07,722
Meningitis?

972
00:50:07,764 --> 00:50:09,516
How long has she been sick?

973
00:50:09,516 --> 00:50:12,684
Over a week now, and we stillcan't get her fever down.

974
00:50:12,726 --> 00:50:15,687
Maybe I can pick her spirits up.

975
00:50:15,687 --> 00:50:18,272
You always do, Lawrence...

976
00:50:18,314 --> 00:50:20,733

Was that thisnot really.You.Not really?

1094
00:56:44,797 --> 00:56:46,423
Dear miss maud.

1095
00:56:46,423 --> 00:56:48,467
I guess she wentabout the time

1096
00:56:48,509 --> 00:56:51,010
that the good lorddear spared miss Andrea.

1097
00:56:51,052 --> 00:56:53,221
If you'll sign here...

1098
00:56:53,263 --> 00:56:55,097
Acknowledging receipt

1099
00:56:55,138 --> 00:56:58,100
our businesswill be concluded.

1100
00:56:58,142 --> 00:57:00,184
That surely doesconclude our business.

1101
00:57:00,226 --> 00:57:01,811
Good day, Mr. Potter.

1102
00:57:01,853 --> 00:57:03,771
Good day, sir.

1103
00:57:23,245 --> 00:57:24,746
Look, mama.

1104
00:57:24,788 --> 00:57:26,206
It's a dress.

1105
00:57:26,206 --> 00:57:27,665
Oh, how pretty.

1106
00:57:27,665 --> 00:57:29,500
Go show itto Catherine.

1107
00:57:29,542 --> 00:57:30,626
Thanks, daddy..

1108
00:57:30,668 --> 00:57:32,003
You're welcome, sweetie.

1109
00:57:32,044 --> 00:57:33,295
David, it's lovely

1110
00:57:33,336 --> 00:57:35,088
but it's Miles too big.

1111
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:36,798
Maybe when she's ten.

1112
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,549
I'm not good at this, am I?

1113
00:57:38,591 --> 00:57:41,218
Well... otherwise,you'd be perfect.

1114
00:57:41,218 --> 00:57:43,596
Thank you.

1115
00:57:43,637 --> 00:57:46,723
And now, a giftfor my big girl.

1116
00:57:46,723 --> 00:57:48,182
Here.

1117
00:57:48,224 --> 00:57:49,683
I hope you like it.

1118
00:57:49,725 --> 00:57:51,184
Nice paper.

1119
00:57:51,226 --> 00:57:52,728
I wrapped it myself.

1120
00:57:52,728 --> 00:57:54,146
Really?

1121
00:57:54,188 --> 00:57:56,439
What, you don't believe me?

1122
00:58:01,318 --> 00:58:04,112
Oh, David, it's beautiful.

1123
00:58:04,154 --> 00:58:06,906
I found it in an antique shopin London.

1124
00:58:06,906 --> 00:58:09,033
Look inside.

1125
00:58:12,202 --> 00:58:13,912
A Bible.

1126
00:58:13,953 --> 00:58:17,331
Turn to the pagewith the bookmarker.

1127
00:58:18,582 --> 00:58:23,252
"The lord is my Shepherd;I shall not want."

1128
00:58:23,252 --> 00:58:26,672
Remember the prayer serviceyou took me to?

1129
00:58:26,714 --> 00:58:29,090
It was our first date.

1130
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:31,009
Only date.

1131
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:38,974
Oh, this is the mostwonderful christmasi've ever had.

1132
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:42,936
Are you goingto kiss mommy?

1133
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:44,562
I sure am.

1134
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:49,316
And don't think you're goingto get away without one.

1135
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:51,901
Merry Christmas,sweetheart.

1136
00:58:51,943 --> 00:58:53,235
Merry Christmas.

1137
00:58:53,277 --> 00:58:54,695
Merry Christmas.

1138
00:58:54,737 --> 00:58:56,571
(All laughing)

1139
00:58:58,949 --> 00:59:00,325
You got a moment?

1140
00:59:00,367 --> 00:59:02,284
If it's about losingthat contract

1141
00:59:02,284 --> 00:59:04,995
we're not going back in againwith a lowball bid.

1142
00:59:05,037 --> 00:59:06,955
I'm not goingto let them force me

1143
00:59:06,996 --> 00:59:08,998
into cutting the wagesof my people.

1144
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,875
Then what arewe going to do?

1145
00:59:10,917 --> 00:59:13,585
If we don't getsome new business,we're going under.

1146
00:59:13,627 --> 00:59:16,630
Then what's going tohappen toyourpeople?

1147
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:18,965
I built this businessduring the depression.

1148
00:59:18,965 --> 00:59:21,801
We made it through the war,and I won't let anything

1149
00:59:21,801 --> 00:59:24,803
happen to this companyor to those people down there.

1150
00:59:24,803 --> 00:59:28,014
We made sue? Call Mary. Tell herand I woni'll see her for dinner

1151
00:59:28,056 --> 00:59:31,350
but I'm going to stopby Lawrence's placeon the way home.

1152
00:59:31,392 --> 00:59:35,436
Hey, George, get thatworried look off your face.

1153
00:59:37,313 --> 00:59:40,273
(Dog barking)

1154
00:59:48,739 --> 00:59:50,992
(Gunshot)

1155
00:59:59,123 --> 01:00:00,916
Oh, my God.

1156
01:00:12,217 --> 01:00:13,384
Lawrence...

1157
01:00:20,015 --> 01:00:22,684
Lawrence,it's me.

1158
01:00:28,731 --> 01:00:30,606
What happened?

1159
01:00:34,527 --> 01:00:37,279
He came inwith that gun...

1160
01:00:37,321 --> 01:00:42,116
Mad because miss maudcut him out of her will.

1161
01:00:42,158 --> 01:00:46,245
He said that I had castsome sort of a spell over her

1162
01:00:46,287 --> 01:00:49,622
and cheated himout of a valuable clock.

1163
01:00:52,416 --> 01:00:54,001
I've been in war

1164
01:00:54,043 --> 01:00:56,587
and I know the lookin a man's eyes

1165
01:00:56,628 --> 01:00:59,881
when he's fixing to kill, but...

1166
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:02,216
Wasn't no clockthat man was after.

1167
01:01:02,216 --> 01:01:04,384
It was me.

1168
01:01:04,384 --> 01:01:06,303
I tried to...

1169
01:01:06,303 --> 01:01:09,722
Tear the gun out of his hand...

1170
01:01:09,722 --> 01:01:11,682
Iit went off.

1171
01:01:13,392 --> 01:01:16,144
Tear the gun out of his hanokay.

1172
01:01:16,186 --> 01:01:18,521
All right.

1173
01:01:24,651 --> 01:01:27,487
What the hell happened here?

1174
01:01:27,528 --> 01:01:29,489
Did you kill him?

1175
01:01:30,448 --> 01:01:32,491
David:No.

1176
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:37,203
I did.

1177
01:01:51,965 --> 01:01:55,176
Mary:I thought you mightlike some tea.

1178
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:05,392
Why did you tellthem you did it?

1179
01:02:05,392 --> 01:02:08,187
Why don't you think I did?

1180
01:02:11,606 --> 01:02:14,109
Why did you tellbecause you're my husband

1181
01:02:14,109 --> 01:02:17,111
and I know you.

1182
01:02:17,152 --> 01:02:20,488
You're not capableof killing anyone.

1183
01:02:20,530 --> 01:02:24,283
Everyone's capableof killing.

1184
01:02:24,325 --> 01:02:27,202
It was Lawrence who shot him,wasn't it?

1185
01:02:30,622 --> 01:02:33,374
I knewhe'd never get a fair trial

1186
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,209
and even if he was acquitted

1187
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,127
gannon's friendswould come after him.

1188
01:02:37,127 --> 01:02:38,962
The only way to protect him

1189
01:02:39,003 --> 01:02:41,339
was to keep him out of italtogether.

1190
01:02:41,381 --> 01:02:46,510
How can he meanso much to you...

1191
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:48,886
That you're willingto put everything--

1192
01:02:48,886 --> 01:02:52,014
everything we haveso muin jeopardy?

1193
01:02:54,432 --> 01:02:56,685
That you're willingduring world war it everything--

1194
01:02:56,726 --> 01:02:58,645
my father wasthe white captain

1195
01:02:58,645 --> 01:03:00,729
of a negrorifle company

1196
01:03:00,729 --> 01:03:03,315
and lawrencewas his sergeant.

1197
01:03:03,357 --> 01:03:07,610
Of a negrothere was a battle in France...

1198
01:03:10,529 --> 01:03:13,240
And my father's companywas in the middle of it.

1199
01:03:13,282 --> 01:03:16,534
They were gettingcut to pieces

1200
01:03:16,576 --> 01:03:20,746
and in the middleof this battle

1201
01:03:20,788 --> 01:03:23,540
Lawrence...

1202
01:03:23,582 --> 01:03:26,084
Repaired a machine gun

1203
01:03:26,126 --> 01:03:27,918
and used it

1204
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:31,630
and allowed the wholecompany to escape.

1205
01:03:31,672 --> 01:03:34,340
He saved my father's life.

1206
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:36,217
Dad proposed him

1207
01:03:36,217 --> 01:03:39,595
for the congressionalmedal of honor.Her's life.

1208
01:03:39,595 --> 01:03:42,264
Of course,he never received it.

1209
01:03:42,264 --> 01:03:44,056
It was unthinkablenalfor a negronor.Her's life.

1210
01:03:44,098 --> 01:03:47,059
To receive such an honorin those daysived it.

1211
01:03:47,101 --> 01:03:50,645
But...

1212
01:03:50,645 --> 01:03:55,024
My father never forgot...

1213
01:03:55,024 --> 01:03:57,151
And neither can I.

1214
01:03:57,193 --> 01:04:00,111
I'd alreadylost my mother. Forgot...

1215
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:06,533
Without Lawrence, I wouldhave lost my father, too.

1216
01:04:06,533 --> 01:04:09,077
I owe him.

1217
01:04:13,247 --> 01:04:15,458
I owe this man.

1218
01:04:18,376 --> 01:04:21,546
We give the drill cuttershalf their previous area.

1219
01:04:21,546 --> 01:04:25,424
We set up the production sitefor the new prototype drill

1220
01:04:25,466 --> 01:04:27,383
we give the drill cuttersover in that quadrant.Ea.

1221
01:04:27,383 --> 01:04:28,843
That'd work.

1222
01:04:28,885 --> 01:04:30,553
David, thetrial's tomorrow.

1223
01:04:30,595 --> 01:04:32,013
It's stillnot too late.

1224
01:04:32,055 --> 01:04:33,013
George, please.

1225
01:04:33,055 --> 01:04:34,473
How can I beyour friend

1226
01:04:34,473 --> 01:04:36,517
if I don't tellyou what I feel?

1227
01:04:36,517 --> 01:04:38,101
How can I belook, I know what I'm doing.Iend

1228
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:39,477
if I don't telli don't think you do.

1229
01:04:39,518 --> 01:04:41,729
A self-defense pleamight get Lawrence off

1230
01:04:41,729 --> 01:04:44,689
but in any case,he's an old manwith few years left.

1231
01:04:44,731 --> 01:04:46,691
You've got your wholelife ahead of you.

1232
01:04:46,733 --> 01:04:49,194
What kind of a lifewould I have

1233
01:04:49,194 --> 01:04:51,028
if I betrayed a friend?

1234
01:04:51,028 --> 01:04:52,655
What kind of a lifewouldyou haven't betrayed anyone

1235
01:04:52,696 --> 01:04:55,031
and even if you had,if I betrayed the man's a negro.

1236
01:04:55,073 --> 01:04:57,408
You've got to thinkofyourfamily first.

1237
01:04:57,408 --> 01:05:00,286
I have work.

1238
01:05:00,328 --> 01:05:02,246
So do you.

1239
01:05:04,957 --> 01:05:07,375
David, Lawrence is here.

1240
01:05:07,416 --> 01:05:09,835
I'm sorry to drop byso late, Mr. p, but...

1241
01:05:09,835 --> 01:05:11,337
No. Come onin, Lawrence.

1242
01:05:11,379 --> 01:05:12,796
I'm sorry to drop bywe got to talk.R. P, but...

1243
01:05:12,837 --> 01:05:14,422
Here, have a seat.

1244
01:05:14,422 --> 01:05:15,882
No, sir. Thank you.

1245
01:05:15,882 --> 01:05:18,092
I can't let you do this. A seat.

1246
01:05:18,092 --> 01:05:21,804
Lawrence, you're not goingno, sir. To talk me out of this.

1247
01:05:21,845 --> 01:05:23,930
Mr. p-- now, don'tget me wrong--u do this. A seat.

1248
01:05:23,930 --> 01:05:26,891
I appreciate whatyou're trying to do for me

1249
01:05:26,933 --> 01:05:29,935
but a man's conscienceis a powerful thing.

1250
01:05:29,935 --> 01:05:32,229
The fact is,I can't live with this.

1251
01:05:32,271 --> 01:05:33,647
The fact is

1252
01:05:33,689 --> 01:05:35,606
if you put yourfate in the hands

1253
01:05:35,606 --> 01:05:38,609
of the law around here,you might not live at all.

1254
01:05:38,651 --> 01:05:42,195
What if something goes wrongyourand they put you away? The hands

1255
01:05:42,237 --> 01:05:45,406
what about Mrs. p and missy?What happens to them?

1256
01:05:45,447 --> 01:05:46,949
Nothing's goingto happen.

1257
01:05:46,949 --> 01:05:48,492
Nothing's goingto go wrong.

1258
01:05:48,534 --> 01:05:51,202
I've never known any goodto come of telling a lie.

1259
01:05:51,244 --> 01:05:54,038
I'm doing thisto protect you.

1260
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,290
I don't need protection.

1261
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:57,833
I didn't do anything wrong.

1262
01:05:57,874 --> 01:06:00,544
I've always put my trustin the man upstairs.

1263
01:06:00,585 --> 01:06:04,755
All I have to dois tell the truth.

1264
01:06:04,797 --> 01:06:07,340
Lawrence...

1265
01:06:07,382 --> 01:06:10,093
You know and I know

1266
01:06:10,135 --> 01:06:14,555
that sometimes, thetruth isn't enough.

1267
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:23,478
When you crouched bythe body of the shooting victim

1268
01:06:23,478 --> 01:06:26,398
did you ascertainthat he wasalready dead?

1269
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,608
When you crouched bythe body of the shootyes, I did.

1270
01:06:27,649 --> 01:06:29,483
What else didyou determine?

1271
01:06:29,525 --> 01:06:31,485
Well, ev gannon,the victim

1272
01:06:31,527 --> 01:06:32,778
had been drinking.

1273
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:35,322
I got quite a whiffof 90 proof.

1274
01:06:35,363 --> 01:06:36,698
Officer Brooks

1275
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:39,242
would you please usethe pointer again

1276
01:06:39,284 --> 01:06:41,660
to show the jury wheremr. Parkin was standing

1277
01:06:41,702 --> 01:06:43,203
in relationto the victim?

1278
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:45,747
Right about there.

1279
01:06:45,747 --> 01:06:47,665
He had the gunin his hands?

1280
01:06:47,665 --> 01:06:49,167
Right yes, he did.

1281
01:06:49,167 --> 01:06:51,126
Who did that gunthe gunbelong to?N his hands?

1282
01:06:51,168 --> 01:06:54,046
It was purchasedby everen gannon.

1283
01:06:54,087 --> 01:06:57,590
And where waslawrence Flynn

1284
01:06:57,590 --> 01:06:59,550
the owner ofthe property?

1285
01:06:59,592 --> 01:07:01,927
And where wahe was sitting rightlawrence flynnthere on the bed.

1286
01:07:01,969 --> 01:07:05,305
And how did Lawrence flynnappear to you, officer Brooks?

1287
01:07:05,347 --> 01:07:08,057
Like he was in shock.

1288
01:07:08,098 --> 01:07:11,518
I figured since gannon hadtrespassed on his place

1289
01:07:11,518 --> 01:07:12,853
that he'dkilled the man

1290
01:07:12,895 --> 01:07:16,731
and Mr. parkin hadtaken the gun from him.

1291
01:07:16,773 --> 01:07:17,857
Objection.

1292
01:07:17,899 --> 01:07:19,232
Conjecture.

1293
01:07:19,274 --> 01:07:20,859
Sustained.

1294
01:07:20,859 --> 01:07:22,486
You'll disregard

1295
01:07:22,527 --> 01:07:24,236
officer Brooks'sustained.Comment.

1296
01:07:24,236 --> 01:07:25,613
Go on.

1297
01:07:25,655 --> 01:07:28,908
Forget what was Brooks'in your mind, sir.T.

1298
01:07:28,949 --> 01:07:32,160
Just tell us exactly whatyou said to Lawrence Flynn.

1299
01:07:32,202 --> 01:07:34,663
I said, "whathappened here?

1300
01:07:34,704 --> 01:07:36,205
Did you kill him?"

1301
01:07:36,205 --> 01:07:37,998
And what didflynn say?

1302
01:07:37,998 --> 01:07:39,792
He didn't say anything.

1303
01:07:39,792 --> 01:07:42,043
Anmr. Parkinspoke up instead.

1304
01:07:42,043 --> 01:07:44,420
And what didmr. Parkin say?N't say anything.

1305
01:07:44,462 --> 01:07:46,755
He said that he did it--

1306
01:07:46,797 --> 01:07:50,592
that he shotthe man himself.

1307
01:07:50,634 --> 01:07:53,886
Please examinethe pistol, Mr. parkin.

1308
01:07:53,928 --> 01:07:56,555
Is that the weaponin question?

1309
01:07:56,597 --> 01:07:57,889
Yes, it is.

1310
01:07:57,889 --> 01:08:01,559
Will you please tell the courtexactly what you saw

1311
01:08:01,601 --> 01:08:02,894
and what happened

1312
01:08:02,894 --> 01:08:05,104
when you enteredflynn's workshop?

1313
01:08:05,145 --> 01:08:06,689
When I enteredthe shop

1314
01:08:06,689 --> 01:08:08,315
Mr. gannonhad the gun

1315
01:08:08,357 --> 01:08:09,774
when I enteredpointed at Mr. Flynn.

1316
01:08:09,774 --> 01:08:12,652
When he saw me, heaimed the gun at me

1317
01:08:12,694 --> 01:08:15,028
when ibut I knocked thepoinbarrel in the air

1318
01:08:15,070 --> 01:08:16,488
before he could fire.

1319
01:08:16,530 --> 01:08:18,824
And in the fightfor the gun

1320
01:08:18,865 --> 01:08:22,326
it discharged, andmr. Gannon was shot.

1321
01:08:22,368 --> 01:08:23,661
May I remind you, sir

1322
01:08:23,702 --> 01:08:26,454
of the testimony ofthe forensic expert?

1323
01:08:26,496 --> 01:08:29,791
That there were three setsof prints on that gun--

1324
01:08:29,791 --> 01:08:34,002
yours, the victim's,and Lawrence Flynn's.

1325
01:08:34,002 --> 01:08:36,170
Thatmr. Parkin, three setscan you explainhat gun--

1326
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:38,506

As Mr. flynnhas already testified

1330
01:08:44,177 --> 01:08:47,055
Mr. gannon came into the shopand pulled the gun.

1331
01:08:47,097 --> 01:08:48,931
They struggledover the gun.

1332
01:08:48,973 --> 01:08:51,183
Isn't it more likely, sir

1333
01:08:51,183 --> 01:08:53,101
that you concoctedthis whole story

1334
01:08:53,143 --> 01:08:55,895
just to protectisn't it mlawrence Flynn?

1335
01:08:55,937 --> 01:08:57,272

Yes, I am.

1343
01:09:56,612 --> 01:09:59,614
Will the defendantplease rise?

01:13:13,814 --> 01:13:17,026
(Sniffs)

1398
01:13:27,117 --> 01:13:30,662

1399
01:13:30,662 --> 01:13:33,247
Dear God! Andrea!

(Crying)

1410
01:14:02,187 --> 01:14:03,855
It's impossible for us

1411
01:14:03,897 --> 01:14:06,191
to understandthe death of a child--

1412
01:14:06,191 --> 01:14:07,484
this precious life

1413
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:11,153
that we have nurturedfrom the moment of birth.

1414
01:14:11,195 --> 01:14:15,240
She's becomeso much a part of us.

1415
01:14:15,281 --> 01:14:17,492
So we must reach outfrom the darkness

1416
01:14:17,492 --> 01:14:19,159
of our very human grief

1417
01:14:19,159 --> 01:14:22,788
with the light we must reach outof faithfrom the darkness

1418
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:25,248
as the scripturespromisedur very human grief

1419
01:14:25,289 --> 01:14:26,791
"come unto me

1420
01:14:26,833 --> 01:14:29,960
"all ye that laborand are heavy laden

1421
01:14:30,002 --> 01:14:32,629
and I will give you rest."

1422
01:14:34,131 --> 01:14:37,174
Mary and David,let me assure you

1423
01:14:37,216 --> 01:14:38,676
that the only love

1424
01:14:38,718 --> 01:14:41,010
greater than a parents' love

1425
01:14:41,052 --> 01:14:43,972
is the love that God hasfor his children.

1426
01:14:45,557 --> 01:14:47,057
May it give you peace

1427
01:14:47,099 --> 01:14:49,560
in knowingthat your sweet Andrea

1428
01:14:49,601 --> 01:14:50,894

01:14:50,936 --> 01:14:54,021
in the loving armsof our heavenly father.

1430

1442
01:16:01,285 --> 01:16:03,204
That's not quitethe last one.

1443
01:16:03,245 --> 01:16:06,790
Mary won't let goof the rose gold watch.

1444
01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:08,500
Can you blame her?

1445
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:11,585

1448
01:16:19,967 --> 01:16:21,384
She was, uh...

1449
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:27,765
She was a very special girl,that little missy.

1450
01:16:27,807 --> 01:16:31,018
Not a day goes by thati don't think about her.

1451
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:32,519
I used to look forward

1452
01:16:32,519 --> 01:16:36,397
to every day I couldspend with her.

1453
01:16:38,982 --> 01:16:43,277
I don't havei usmany sunrises left

1454
01:16:43,319 --> 01:16:47,824
but I'll alwaysbe sorry that...

1455
01:16:47,865 --> 01:16:51,243
Little miss Andrea hadto die because of me.

1456
01:16:57,164 --> 01:16:58,541
Lawrence...

1457
01:17:02,043 --> 01:17:04,462
Andrea didn't diebecause of you.

1458
01:17:04,504 --> 01:17:08,257
If Cal Avery hadn'thated me so much

1459
01:17:08,298 --> 01:17:10,591
this would nothave happened.

1460
01:17:12,301 --> 01:17:14,220
Nobody brought more joy

1461
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:18,515
into Andrea's lifethan you did.

1462
01:17:19,808 --> 01:17:25,521
And if anybody isresponsible for her death,

1463
01:17:25,563 --> 01:17:28,106
it's me.

1464
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:39,031
I think we finally decidedto sell the house.

1465
01:17:39,073 --> 01:17:42,326
Mary, I know how muchyou love it here.

1466
01:17:42,368 --> 01:17:44,452
But I'm ready to let go.

1467
01:17:44,494 --> 01:17:47,330
The only way David willever find peace of mind

1468
01:17:47,372 --> 01:17:49,456
is if we leave this house.

1469
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:51,208
Then he's notdoing any better?

1470
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:52,376
Oh, he's doing better

1471
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:54,086
if you'retalking about work.

1472
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:55,545
The business is thriving

1473
01:17:55,545 --> 01:17:56,963
but he's never home.

1474
01:17:56,963 --> 01:17:59,716
Whenever I tryto talk about andreaving

1475
01:17:59,716 --> 01:18:01,967
he says nothing.Ome.

1476
01:18:03,677 --> 01:18:06,053
Wheneveryou know, he hasn't evento talk aboubeen to the cemetery

1477
01:18:06,095 --> 01:18:07,722
since we buried her.

1478
01:18:07,722 --> 01:18:10,016
I'm sorry.

1479
01:18:10,057 --> 01:18:12,767
Please, sit down.

1480
01:18:15,228 --> 01:18:17,062
And it isn't grief

1481
01:18:17,062 --> 01:18:19,064
I see in his eyes.

1482
01:18:19,064 --> 01:18:22,442
It's... it's anger.

1483
01:18:22,442 --> 01:18:25,528
You know, it wasn'tjust Andrea's life

1484
01:18:25,528 --> 01:18:27,905
that was taken away from me.

1485
01:18:27,905 --> 01:18:31,575
You know, it wasn'ti lost David, tooe

1486
01:18:31,617 --> 01:18:34,160
and nowit's Christmas, and...Om me.

1487
01:18:34,202 --> 01:18:36,871
No matter how hard I try

1488
01:18:36,871 --> 01:18:40,165
there's nothing to celebrate.

1489
01:18:42,083 --> 01:18:44,668
Are you sure you won'thave some tea?Hard I try

1490
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:45,711
Mary...

1491
01:18:45,711 --> 01:18:49,089
I'm sorry,father Mike.

1492
01:18:49,089 --> 01:18:52,258
I wish I had a little moreof the Christmas spirit.

1493
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:57,638
Mary, in time, you'll learnto live with your grief

1494
01:18:57,638 --> 01:19:01,432
but not beforeyou learn to forgive.

1495
01:19:01,432 --> 01:19:04,435
Mary, ingod's love is basedto live won forgiveness

1496
01:19:04,435 --> 01:19:06,102
and he forgives us

1497
01:19:06,102 --> 01:19:09,731
and, in turn, he expects usto forgive our fellow man.

1498
01:19:10,941 --> 01:19:12,441
How can we?Forgives us

1499
01:19:12,441 --> 01:19:16,779
maybe it's time to thinkabout someone else.

1500
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:20,198
Time to do somethingfor another child.

1501
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:23,867
I know a little girlnamed Martha

1502
01:19:23,909 --> 01:19:27,704
who isn't going to havemuch of a Christmas.

1503
01:19:58,896 --> 01:20:00,147
Father Mike.

1504
01:20:00,147 --> 01:20:01,315
How you doing, Ruth?

1505
01:20:01,357 --> 01:20:03,149
This is Mary

1506
01:20:03,149 --> 01:20:04,484
a friend of mine.

1507
01:20:04,526 --> 01:20:06,611
This could we come in?

1508
01:20:13,533 --> 01:20:14,826
Sorry about the house.

1509
01:20:14,826 --> 01:20:16,327
It's sort of a mess.

1510
01:20:16,327 --> 01:20:18,495
Oh, it's fine.

1511
01:20:18,537 --> 01:20:20,414
Did Martha do this?

1512
01:20:20,455 --> 01:20:23,375
Yes. She likesto make things.

1513
01:20:26,335 --> 01:20:28,671
It's very pretty.

1514
01:20:28,671 --> 01:20:29,921
Where is she?

1515
01:20:29,963 --> 01:20:32,215
Martha, you don'thave to hide.It's very pretty.

1516
01:20:32,257 --> 01:20:36,010
It's just father mikeand a friend of his.

1517
01:20:36,051 --> 01:20:37,761
Martha Anne!

1518
01:20:50,188 --> 01:20:53,524
I like your Christmas tree.

1519
01:20:53,566 --> 01:20:55,359
This is my friend Mary.

1520
01:20:55,359 --> 01:20:57,777
Hello, Martha.

1521
01:20:57,819 --> 01:21:00,488
She brought you something.

1522
01:21:06,744 --> 01:21:09,287
It's for you.

1523
01:21:11,956 --> 01:21:15,125
It's all right.It's yours to keep.

1524
01:21:24,008 --> 01:21:26,634
(Rattling and jangling)

1525
01:21:39,479 --> 01:21:40,937
David.

1526
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:42,898
I didn't expect youhome so early.

1527
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:44,274
Hi, sweetheart.

1528
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:45,484
I didn't expect youhello, David. So early.

1529
01:21:45,525 --> 01:21:46,650
Father.

1530
01:21:46,692 --> 01:21:48,569
I've had the mostmarvelous afternoon.

1531
01:21:48,569 --> 01:21:52,030
Father Mike took meto meet the dearest little girl.

1532
01:21:52,030 --> 01:21:53,865
I gave herad the mosta Christmas giftternoon.

1533
01:21:53,907 --> 01:21:55,700
Father Mike took meto and her face just lit up.Irl.

1534
01:21:55,742 --> 01:21:57,410
I wish you'd been there.

1535
01:21:57,410 --> 01:22:00,954
For the first timesince Andrea died, I...

1536
01:22:00,996 --> 01:22:03,581
I found myself smiling

1537
01:22:03,581 --> 01:22:06,918
and her poor motherhas two other children

1538
01:22:06,959 --> 01:22:10,879
and no money to givethem a Christmas. Smiling

1539
01:22:10,921 --> 01:22:12,798
who is this family?

1540
01:22:12,839 --> 01:22:14,256
The mother's

1541
01:22:14,298 --> 01:22:15,424
really trying hard

1542
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:17,593
but things have beenvery difficult for them

1543
01:22:17,635 --> 01:22:19,969
ever since her husbandwent to prison.

1544
01:22:21,179 --> 01:22:23,723
Martha's last nameis Avery.

1545
01:22:23,765 --> 01:22:26,517
She's Cal Avery's daughter.

1546
01:22:27,601 --> 01:22:30,812
I wasn't tryingto deceive you, Mary.

1547
01:22:30,853 --> 01:22:34,857
I just wanted you to feelthe spirit of Christmas again.

1548
01:22:37,109 --> 01:22:41,279
I hope you and David canfind it in your hearts

1549
01:22:41,321 --> 01:22:43,405
to forgive.

1550
01:22:53,789 --> 01:22:55,916
Forgive?

1551
01:22:55,916 --> 01:22:58,001
(Short exhale)

1552
01:23:02,088 --> 01:23:06,675
I've spent my whole life

1553
01:23:06,716 --> 01:23:10,678
trying to forgive.

1554
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:15,515
First, my motherfor leaving us

1555
01:23:15,557 --> 01:23:18,434
and now, Cal Avery...

1556
01:23:20,978 --> 01:23:23,981
And as hard as that's been

1557
01:23:23,981 --> 01:23:27,400
it could never be as hardas forgiving myself.

1558
01:23:33,905 --> 01:23:35,824
I let my little girl down.

1559
01:23:35,824 --> 01:23:38,033
I let her down.

1560
01:23:38,033 --> 01:23:41,662
I was supposedto take care of her

1561
01:23:41,662 --> 01:23:43,955
I lprotect her.

1562
01:23:49,626 --> 01:23:51,628
I failed her.

1563
01:23:57,049 --> 01:23:58,926
David.

1564
01:24:03,054 --> 01:24:05,181
Come with me.

1565
01:26:04,821 --> 01:26:06,613
Merry Christmas.

1566
01:26:06,613 --> 01:26:09,950
Thank you.

1567
01:26:09,950 --> 01:26:12,410
Merry Christmas.Merry Christmas.

1568
01:26:24,962 --> 01:26:28,173
Thank yomerry Christmas.

1569
01:29:08,721 --> 01:29:10,889
Richard:How do you measure time?

1570
01:29:10,889 --> 01:29:12,933
Is it in hours and years

1571
01:29:12,933 --> 01:29:16,602
or is it more likelyin love and relationships?

1572
01:29:16,602 --> 01:29:19,771
For Mary and davi,is it the lesson was clea:

1573
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:22,190
Or is it more likelyin time is precious.Hips?

1574
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:24,985
For Mary and davi,it is also elusive and finite.

1575
01:29:24,985 --> 01:29:27,445
Orbut the thingselyinthat give us hope--ips?

1576
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:29,238
For Mary and davi,it is love and family finite.

1577
01:29:29,238 --> 01:29:31,614
Orbut the thingselyfaith and forgiveness--s?

1578
01:29:31,614 --> 01:29:37,077
Somehow transcendd davi,even the boundaries of time..
