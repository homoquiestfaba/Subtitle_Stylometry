1
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,160
Argo!

2
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:27,163
What's wrong with that dog?

3
00:03:27,294 --> 00:03:29,687
Hey, Ace.

4
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:31,950
That should keep Johnny
happy for a few years.

5
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:33,517
He's been bugging me for weeks.

6
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:35,998
Hm.

7
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:37,042
Pretty good on me, huh?

8
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:45,616
So who brought the tin can?

9
00:03:45,747 --> 00:03:49,011
I don't know, but MIG saidit worked great in Cambodia.

10
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:50,708
You want to go for a ride, Ace?

11
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:53,320
I hate those damn things--

12
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,886
prefer the fresh air.

13
00:03:55,017 --> 00:03:57,454
I don't blame you.

14
00:03:57,585 --> 00:04:00,283
So what's the story?

15
00:04:00,414 --> 00:04:03,939
You need to move the
party North, as usual.

16
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:05,897
Nobody invited the land mines.

17
00:04:06,028 --> 00:04:07,595
So Johnny got in all right?

18
00:04:07,725 --> 00:04:09,510
Yeah, sure he's
at home with old Mo.

19
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:15,080
Waxman, get the snake ready.

20
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:16,212
We're going in 10.

21
00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:17,126
Yes, sir!

22
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:22,305
So get this-- last
night he says to me--

23
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:26,396
he says, why do you
call me Bug, Daddy?

24
00:04:26,527 --> 00:04:29,051
I say, well, hey, son,it's a pet name, you know?

25
00:04:29,181 --> 00:04:31,183
Shows how I feel about you.

26
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:33,011
Can I speak to your
CO for a second, guys?

27
00:04:33,142 --> 00:04:34,752
Yes, sir.

28
00:04:34,883 --> 00:04:38,452
So-- so he says, well, Mommy'sgot a pet name for you, too,

29
00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:40,236
Daddy.

30
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:41,585
She calls you asshole.

31
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:43,848
See?

32
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:45,676
I told you she still loves you.

33
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:46,982
Sure.

34
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:48,810
So we got anti-tanks
booby-trapped

35
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,379
with anti-personnels,
all laid in a 50

36
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:53,989
meter radius from the well.

37
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:57,471
It's a real piece of ass.

38
00:05:09,178 --> 00:05:11,267
Well, they're using
a Chinese AV pattern.

39
00:05:16,098 --> 00:05:19,275
Sweet and
sour piece of ass.

40
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:39,164
Stop!

41
00:05:39,295 --> 00:05:40,078
Down.

42
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:06,931
"Murder, She Wrote."

43
00:06:44,142 --> 00:06:46,493
What is it now?

44
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:49,365
I don't know.

45
00:06:49,496 --> 00:06:50,497
I'm trying to find out.

46
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:03,945
There's nothing I've
ever seen before.

47
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:11,735
Man, I'm going back
to get the med kit--

48
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:16,610
Just in--

49
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,480
--case.

50
00:07:21,049 --> 00:07:25,575
You're crazy.
You know that?

51
00:07:25,706 --> 00:07:29,318
Thanks for drawing
me a map to get back.

52
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,973
Watch your step, Doc.

53
00:07:32,103 --> 00:07:32,843
Which one?

54
00:08:19,063 --> 00:08:20,412
!

55
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:37,386
Troops in formation!

56
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:46,395
Go!

57
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,265
Go!

58
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:50,834
Watch the tank!

59
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:16,773
Oh!

60
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,249
.

61
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,295
To the !

62
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:05,735
!

63
00:10:10,348 --> 00:10:11,219
!

64
00:10:36,374 --> 00:10:37,158
Get out!

65
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:43,425
Johnny!

66
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:44,295
Johnny!

67
00:10:48,256 --> 00:10:49,126
Stay there!

68
00:10:56,351 --> 00:10:57,134
Johnny!

69
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:01,617
Johnny!

70
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:12,106
Johnny!

71
00:12:13,907 --> 00:12:15,125
Right, listen up!

72
00:12:15,256 --> 00:12:16,823
Inside that mansion
is Senator Mitchell

73
00:12:16,953 --> 00:12:19,303
Shepherd, the man most likelyto be our next president.

74
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:20,957
He must not perish.

75
00:12:21,088 --> 00:12:23,177
Recon confirms that theback and side entrances are

76
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:24,874
indeed wired with explosives.

77
00:12:25,005 --> 00:12:27,572
However, the perimeter andthe front door remain clear.

78
00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:30,097
My call in is one
alpha six ..

79
00:12:30,227 --> 00:12:34,318
When that front door opensin exactly 93 seconds,

80
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:35,493
leave no terrorist standing.

81
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:46,374
GIs, hurry up!

82
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:49,290
Get into position now!

83
00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:53,250
Is everybody ?

84
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:54,861
back inside.

85
00:12:54,991 --> 00:12:56,514
What's the situation?
- Go, go, go, go, go.

86
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:58,038
All right, Michelle, let's go.

87
00:12:58,168 --> 00:13:00,388
The situation is
demolition man inside.

88
00:13:00,518 --> 00:13:02,129
They've taken Senator
Shepherd hostage.

89
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:04,305
We've got recon
checking back and side

90
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:06,046
entrances for explosions.

91
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:08,570
Look out!

92
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,571
Come on!

93
00:13:17,274 --> 00:13:18,014
Let's go.

94
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:20,016
Hurry, hurry.

95
00:13:20,147 --> 00:13:21,496
Come on, .

96
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:34,944
Move it!

97
00:13:35,075 --> 00:13:37,294
What you going to do?

98
00:13:37,425 --> 00:13:38,643
You can't go anywhere.

99
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:39,601
You're surrounded.

100
00:13:39,731 --> 00:13:40,820
You can't get out of here.

101
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,739
Move in!

102
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,002
Move in!

103
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:50,742
We're almost here
at the house now.

104
00:13:57,793 --> 00:13:58,663
Oh, no!

105
00:14:08,804 --> 00:14:09,587
Ooh!

106
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,029
Oh!

107
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,508
Ooh!

108
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,467
Uh!

109
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:20,468
Ah!

110
00:14:20,598 --> 00:14:21,382
Oh!

111
00:14:25,168 --> 00:14:25,908
Uh.

112
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:38,399
The blast that killed theSWAT team came from landmines.

113
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:40,444
What?

114
00:14:40,575 --> 00:14:44,448
They planted land
mines in my front yard?

115
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,189
I have a gardener,
for Christ sakes.

116
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,323
He was arrested this morningSenator, the FBI assured us

117
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:51,020
that they had
thoroughly searched

118
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:54,937
the grounds before the guestsarrived and found nothing.

119
00:14:55,068 --> 00:14:57,548
Now it seems that
forensics turned up

120
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:00,290
some interesting
fragments yesterday.

121
00:15:00,421 --> 00:15:02,510
They suggested we send itto one of our specialists

122
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,598
for further analysis.

123
00:15:07,036 --> 00:15:10,126
Jesus wept, son.

124
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:13,129
What are you telling me?

125
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,088
Terrorists with top
secret technology?

126
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:20,441
Even the Arabs who blew upthe World fucking Trade Center

127
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:22,051
had to light a goddamn fuse.

128
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,494
You're telling me thatthis thing is one of ours?

129
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,235
No, Alan.

130
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:36,326
What I'm telling you is it'sone of ours, but we lost it.

131
00:15:36,457 --> 00:15:39,155
This document was
deemed classified,

132
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:42,985
making it illegal for UncleSam to export landmines.

133
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:47,511
Two years prior, your office hadcommissioned a company headed

134
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:50,558
by a man named Michael
Lewis to develop

135
00:15:50,688 --> 00:15:55,606
a new type of land mine for saleto the highest foreign bidder.

136
00:15:55,737 --> 00:16:00,394
A smart mine, invisible
to metal detectors

137
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:05,529
or explosive smelling dogs,most forms of minesweeping--

138
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,227
and it's kind of--

139
00:16:07,357 --> 00:16:10,447
One that contained a PTC,a personal tracking device.

140
00:16:10,578 --> 00:16:12,972
An electronic brain
that allows the A6

141
00:16:13,102 --> 00:16:16,453
to track any approaching
target, enabling it to

142
00:16:16,584 --> 00:16:19,500
activate without contact.

143
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:24,418
And how do you know allabout the A6, may I ask, Miss--

144
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:25,767
Michelle Flynn.

145
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:28,639
I created the PTC for Lewis.

146
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:32,774
After the moratorium
passed, Lewis vanished.

147
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:35,777
Intelligence last
traced him to Angola,

148
00:16:35,907 --> 00:16:37,997
home of the rich UNITA rebels.

149
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:40,477
Their civil war is over.

150
00:16:40,608 --> 00:16:43,176
Unita would be fools to dealin black market weapons now.

151
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:49,182
Mitch, I don't know
how I can help you.

152
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:54,056
I do.

153
00:16:54,187 --> 00:16:55,014
Sign this release form.

154
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,020
It's not New York over there.

155
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,979
Hm.

156
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,503
You call the Senator directlyif you run into any problems.

157
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:08,244
The numbers are in this.

158
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:11,595
There's a man there, formerlyof the Humanitarian Order

159
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:14,946
of Chivalry, a now
defunct minesweeping

160
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,732
team, Christian Erickson.

161
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:19,342
The boy's talent for
finding landmines

162
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:22,258
is exceeded only by hiscomplete lack of discipline.

163
00:17:22,389 --> 00:17:24,347
If there's an A6 to
be found in Angola,

164
00:17:24,478 --> 00:17:26,262
he may have already dug it up.

165
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:28,569
He was trained in the
US Special Forces,

166
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:31,180
locked horns with his COand demanded a discharge.

167
00:17:31,311 --> 00:17:35,663
He joined the HOC, went toAngola, and never came back.

168
00:17:35,793 --> 00:17:38,231
He's a real deal
soldier of fortune.

169
00:17:38,361 --> 00:17:39,884
He left his wife for it.

170
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,278
Angola,
Angola, Angola.

171
00:18:17,357 --> 00:18:18,097
You, too.

172
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:22,318
Hi.

173
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:23,406
You must be Shepherd's group?

174
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:24,755
Hi.

175
00:18:24,886 --> 00:18:27,802
I'm Zukili from the
embassy in Rwanda.

176
00:18:27,932 --> 00:18:28,890
Come with me.

177
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,718
I'll explain as I walk, please.

178
00:18:30,848 --> 00:18:32,154
Thank you.

179
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:34,025
Angola,
Angola, Angola.

180
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:38,943
So what's the
average number of mines

181
00:18:39,074 --> 00:18:40,510
that a team would
pull from a place?

182
00:18:40,641 --> 00:18:41,729
Like--

183
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:44,166
Uh, most places,
two's average.

184
00:18:44,297 --> 00:18:47,126
But in Angola, it's
more like four.

185
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:48,039
Thousand?

186
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:03,403
We are here--

187
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:04,230
the Gemstone.

188
00:19:30,604 --> 00:19:31,953
Here we go.

189
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:35,348
Here you go, gentlemen.

190
00:19:35,478 --> 00:19:38,394
A toast-- to the good
Senator Shepherd--

191
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:40,527
a man with enough
vision to send us here.

192
00:19:40,657 --> 00:19:42,790
Because he knows that
inside every Angolan,

193
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,096
there's an American
trying to get out.

194
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,056
Yeah.

195
00:19:58,066 --> 00:19:58,849
Come on!

196
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,938
Come on!

197
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:01,852
OK.

198
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:03,811
Your rooms are upstairs.

199
00:20:03,941 --> 00:20:05,508
Here you go.

200
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:08,598
Now wait for me while I getsome more information, OK?

201
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:09,469
Be right back.

202
00:20:23,918 --> 00:20:26,268
Seven five.

203
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:31,578
Hello.

204
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,449
I'm here.

205
00:20:45,635 --> 00:20:46,419
All right.

206
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:47,898
Give me my money!

207
00:21:03,523 --> 00:21:05,481
Give me my diamonds back.

208
00:21:05,612 --> 00:21:06,874
Ah.

209
00:21:07,004 --> 00:21:07,875
OK.

210
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:10,834
I got $15.

211
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:12,836
$15 more?

212
00:21:26,546 --> 00:21:27,286
Ooh!

213
00:21:28,896 --> 00:21:29,766
Ooh!

214
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:32,291
Ooh!

215
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:34,249
Oh.

216
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,381
Ah.

217
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:36,251
Ooh.

218
00:21:39,472 --> 00:21:40,255
Ah!

219
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:47,697
Ah!

220
00:21:58,882 --> 00:21:59,622
Hey!

221
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:03,147
Ooh!

222
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:10,590
Had enough?

223
00:24:56,016 --> 00:24:58,322
Hey, Ray?--

224
00:24:58,453 --> 00:25:00,890
Vince and I have liberatedabout 10 poppers so far,

225
00:25:01,021 --> 00:25:02,588
just the usual suspects.

226
00:25:02,718 --> 00:25:03,980
I'm going to blow
them before moving on.

227
00:25:04,111 --> 00:25:05,721
Over?
- 10-4.

228
00:25:05,852 --> 00:25:06,853
You take the count.

229
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,872
Everything's cool?

230
00:25:26,002 --> 00:25:27,482
Let's do it.

231
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:28,352
All right.

232
00:25:28,483 --> 00:25:30,354
Let's do it!

233
00:25:30,485 --> 00:25:39,886
Five, four, three, two, one.

234
00:25:49,286 --> 00:25:50,026
Good job, guys.

235
00:25:52,812 --> 00:25:53,595
Come on.

236
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:54,465
Sun's low, let's go.

237
00:25:59,383 --> 00:26:00,167
Jack?

238
00:26:04,998 --> 00:26:07,827
Come on.
Quit screwing around.

239
00:26:07,957 --> 00:26:08,697
Mitch?

240
00:26:17,053 --> 00:26:18,185
We're cool, Ray.

241
00:26:18,315 --> 00:26:22,015
Jack, not too funny man.

242
00:26:22,145 --> 00:26:24,626
Uh, Ms. Flynn?

243
00:26:24,757 --> 00:26:26,236
What does your popper look like?

244
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:29,152
It's made of Kevlar and
shaped like a butterfly.

245
00:26:29,283 --> 00:26:30,023
Yeah, yeah.

246
00:26:30,153 --> 00:26:31,720
What else?

247
00:26:31,851 --> 00:26:34,114
When still active,
there'll be tracking

248
00:26:34,244 --> 00:26:35,550
lights on either end of it.

249
00:26:41,077 --> 00:26:46,300
In that case, found it.

250
00:27:07,887 --> 00:27:11,020
Woo!

251
00:27:11,151 --> 00:27:12,935
That's got to be a record.

252
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:15,285
I am gonna get so
fucked up tonight!

253
00:27:18,158 --> 00:27:20,421
Hey, hey-- what the
hell are you guys doing?

254
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:21,596
Relax, counselor.

255
00:27:21,727 --> 00:27:23,337
It's frozen.

256
00:27:23,467 --> 00:27:25,469
Polyurethane foam
locks everything up.

257
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,515
It's nothing more than
a fancy paperweight now.

258
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,691
Yeah, full of explosives.

259
00:27:29,822 --> 00:27:31,388
I have done this before.

260
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:33,347
It ain't my first barbecue.

261
00:27:33,477 --> 00:27:34,740
Have you guys been
listening to anything

262
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,176
that I've been saying?

263
00:27:36,306 --> 00:27:38,787
The A6 is electrical--
not mechanical.

264
00:27:38,918 --> 00:27:39,745
She's right, Jack.

265
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:40,615
Put it away.

266
00:27:44,401 --> 00:27:45,620
Shit, I forgot my jacket.

267
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:47,491
I'll be right back.

268
00:27:47,622 --> 00:27:49,885
Chicks-- crazy, all of them.

269
00:27:56,022 --> 00:27:57,719
Mitch, as soon as we
get back to the hotel--

270
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:58,981
are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

271
00:27:59,112 --> 00:28:00,504
As soon as we get
back to the hotel,

272
00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:02,071
we're going to have to geton the horn to Shepherd.

273
00:28:02,202 --> 00:28:03,594
Let him know we've gotthings squared away here, OK?

274
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:04,508
Hey!

275
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:05,596
Look out!

276
00:28:18,131 --> 00:28:19,872
Calm down, Ms. Flynn.

277
00:28:20,002 --> 00:28:21,961
Now what do you mean
they're all dead?

278
00:28:22,091 --> 00:28:23,049
What do I mean?

279
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:24,877
I mean, something went wrong.

280
00:28:25,007 --> 00:28:27,314
The chopper blew up,
and so they're dead.

281
00:28:27,444 --> 00:28:28,228
Oh, shit.

282
00:28:30,621 --> 00:28:32,232
All right.

283
00:28:32,362 --> 00:28:35,191
Ms. Flynn, we're going to getyou out of there, all right?

284
00:28:35,322 --> 00:28:37,846
Your contact has arrangedfor a ground unit

285
00:28:37,977 --> 00:28:40,066
to rendezvous with you
at the Zaire border

286
00:28:40,196 --> 00:28:42,111
on the Congo River in two days.

287
00:28:42,242 --> 00:28:43,199
Fine.

288
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,984
And what about the A6?

289
00:28:45,114 --> 00:28:47,290
You just forget about
the A6, OK, Ms. Flynn?

290
00:28:47,421 --> 00:28:49,292
What's important now is to getyou out of there before anyone

291
00:28:49,423 --> 00:28:51,033
starts asking questions.

292
00:28:51,164 --> 00:28:52,818
Now I'm sure you can
appreciate this has

293
00:28:52,948 --> 00:28:54,297
become a potentially
embarrassing

294
00:28:54,428 --> 00:28:55,908
scenario for Senator Shepherd.

295
00:28:56,038 --> 00:28:57,561
You're going to have
to work with us here.

296
00:28:57,692 --> 00:29:00,434
No, I did not come
here for the Senator.

297
00:29:00,564 --> 00:29:04,612
I came here for one reason--to find that damn land mine.

298
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,616
Now look, I'm not leavinguntil I have proof in my hand

299
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,313
that that A6 is in Angola.

300
00:29:10,444 --> 00:29:11,314
OK?

301
00:29:11,445 --> 00:29:12,446
You said I have two days?

302
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,664
Fine.

303
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:15,405
Just make sure that
my escape route

304
00:29:15,536 --> 00:29:16,580
is set to get me out of here.

305
00:29:17,712 --> 00:29:18,452
What?

306
00:29:27,896 --> 00:29:28,810
Where's your money, guys?

307
00:29:29,942 --> 00:29:30,986
How 'bout you, ?

308
00:29:31,117 --> 00:29:31,944
Say, get over here.

309
00:29:32,074 --> 00:29:34,250
What's going on?

310
00:29:34,381 --> 00:29:35,686
Cowards!

311
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,124
Cowards!
Come on!

312
00:29:38,254 --> 00:29:39,560
How 'bout you?

313
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,517
Huh?

314
00:29:40,648 --> 00:29:41,518
Or you?

315
00:29:41,649 --> 00:29:43,782
, how 'bout you?

316
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:45,696
?

317
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:47,698
You got any money on you?

318
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:49,570
Four
says I can do it.

319
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,616
Yeah, you can do it.

320
00:29:52,747 --> 00:29:56,142
Can you do it faster than me?

321
00:29:56,272 --> 00:29:57,665
And who are you?

322
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,276
Yager.

323
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:01,147
Yager.

324
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:06,630
You got it!

325
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:08,110
You got that bet.

326
00:30:11,157 --> 00:30:12,506
To the fire and
back-- first one

327
00:30:12,636 --> 00:30:14,638
to step on a landmine loses.

328
00:30:14,769 --> 00:30:16,118
To the fire and back.

329
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:21,167
Five.

330
00:30:21,297 --> 00:30:22,124
I used to be in the Olympics.

331
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:23,386
Four.

332
00:30:23,517 --> 00:30:24,518
I was competing for--

333
00:30:24,648 --> 00:30:26,259
Three.

334
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:27,826
--for the sports event.

335
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:29,740
One.

336
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:30,741
And zero!

337
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:36,225
What?

338
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:22,750
What are you going to do now?

339
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,234
Yay!

340
00:31:43,162 --> 00:31:43,902
Uh.

341
00:31:55,609 --> 00:31:56,349
Huh.

342
00:32:16,456 --> 00:32:21,374
So what's your threefavorite pleasures in life?

343
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:26,901
A stiff drink before
and a cigarette after.

344
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:33,429
I guess we have
something in common.

345
00:32:42,438 --> 00:32:50,577
So where are your friends?

346
00:32:50,707 --> 00:32:51,491
They're dead.

347
00:32:57,845 --> 00:33:00,979
Well, I guess we have
two things in common.

348
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,426
What about this?

349
00:33:13,556 --> 00:33:14,862
Do we have that in common?

350
00:33:23,653 --> 00:33:27,005
Look, I know who you are--

351
00:33:27,135 --> 00:33:32,140
Christian Erickson, 20,000mine kills confirmed.

352
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:34,621
Publicly applauded byLady Diana herself for it.

353
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:41,323
Member of the Humanitarian--

354
00:33:50,767 --> 00:33:52,595
Time for a cigarette.

355
00:33:58,166 --> 00:33:59,515
Look, it's just one mine.

356
00:34:03,389 --> 00:34:04,781
That's all it takes, lady.

357
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,400
It's not a problem.

358
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:15,270
She's all alone.

359
00:34:21,711 --> 00:34:23,800
I told you, it's not a problem!

360
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:29,284
Will you listen to me?

361
00:34:29,415 --> 00:34:30,677
Your shipment won't be affected.

362
00:34:30,807 --> 00:34:32,331
I'll give you my word.

363
00:34:32,461 --> 00:34:35,595
It will just cost
a little bit more.

364
00:34:35,725 --> 00:34:37,553
Fine.

365
00:34:37,684 --> 00:34:40,339
Look, I'll call later.
I've got work to do.

366
00:34:45,474 --> 00:34:46,693
Please.

367
00:34:46,823 --> 00:34:49,522
I don't know anything.

368
00:34:49,652 --> 00:34:50,740
I've got a wife.

369
00:34:50,871 --> 00:34:51,785
I got a wife and kid.

370
00:34:56,181 --> 00:34:57,356
So pick it up.

371
00:34:57,486 --> 00:34:58,270
Go home.

372
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:05,886
Please don't make me do this.

373
00:35:06,016 --> 00:35:07,279
Who is she working with?

374
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:09,324
I don't know.

375
00:35:12,327 --> 00:35:15,852
Why is she looking
for my landmines?

376
00:35:15,983 --> 00:35:17,419
I don't know!

377
00:35:20,944 --> 00:35:21,989
I suppose he didn't know.

378
00:35:43,053 --> 00:35:43,880
Christian?

379
00:35:47,014 --> 00:35:48,189
Such a sad song.

380
00:35:54,804 --> 00:35:56,676
Come, old friend.

381
00:35:56,806 --> 00:35:57,546
Let's go home.

382
00:36:30,971 --> 00:36:32,451
Zukuli?

383
00:36:32,581 --> 00:36:33,974
MAN : We're lookingfor the American lady.

384
00:36:34,104 --> 00:36:34,888
I'm just getting dressed.

385
00:36:38,283 --> 00:36:39,501
MAN :
Christian send us.

386
00:36:39,632 --> 00:36:41,460
He wants to talk to you.

387
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,984
I'll be right there.

388
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:48,989
Oh, shit.

389
00:36:56,692 --> 00:36:57,998
MAN : Come on, lady.

390
00:36:58,128 --> 00:36:58,955
Open the door.

391
00:37:02,132 --> 00:37:04,961
What's going on?

392
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:22,474
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

393
00:38:22,604 --> 00:38:24,650
You're the white woman
who wants Christian?

394
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,651
Excuse me?

395
00:38:27,522 --> 00:38:29,219
Oh, look, you're right.

396
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,351
Do you know where
I could find him?

397
00:38:30,482 --> 00:38:31,700
I need to speak to him.

398
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:33,398
Inside-- this is his house.

399
00:38:33,528 --> 00:38:36,357
But he's sleeping--
big headache.

400
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:37,532
Gotta be quiet.

401
00:38:37,663 --> 00:38:38,446
Oh.

402
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,407
You know what?

403
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:43,233
I'm going to come back tomorrowwhen he's feeling better.

404
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:44,234
Tomorrow?

405
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:45,366
What a beautiful white word.

406
00:38:45,497 --> 00:38:46,933
Shit might happen.

407
00:38:47,063 --> 00:38:48,543
OK.

408
00:38:48,674 --> 00:38:49,718
Bye.

409
00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:50,763
He's the only one
who can help you

410
00:38:50,893 --> 00:38:52,460
find what you're looking for.

411
00:38:52,591 --> 00:38:55,985
isn't the onlyone with eyes in ..

412
00:39:00,294 --> 00:39:03,602
This is Christian's heart.

413
00:39:03,732 --> 00:39:08,433
A gift from the  toChristian for being in Angola.

414
00:39:08,563 --> 00:39:10,696
Yeah, but the war is over now.

415
00:39:10,826 --> 00:39:13,873
You mustunderstand how ..

416
00:39:14,003 --> 00:39:16,310
What used to belong
to ,,

417
00:39:16,441 --> 00:39:19,966
now belongs to
Consolidated Mine.

418
00:39:20,096 --> 00:39:22,577
What's Consolidated Mines?

419
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:24,144
The diamond company--

420
00:39:24,274 --> 00:39:27,016
our ground is full of diamonds.

421
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:29,758
After the war,
Consolidated Mines

422
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:31,847
hired those
mercenaries

423
00:39:31,978 --> 00:39:33,719
to be their private army.

424
00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:35,634
Now with this army,
they once again

425
00:39:35,764 --> 00:39:38,027
bring terror into our homes.

426
00:39:38,158 --> 00:39:40,987
Yeah, I think I met someof those guys last night.

427
00:39:41,117 --> 00:39:44,991
With them, you
control the people.

428
00:39:45,121 --> 00:39:48,777
Control the people,
control the diamonds.

429
00:39:48,908 --> 00:39:52,172
Control the diamonds,
you control Angola.

430
00:39:52,302 --> 00:39:55,523
For most countries,
truce means peace.

431
00:39:55,654 --> 00:39:58,961
To Angola, truce is terror!

432
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:00,876
Uh.

433
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:17,327
Why are you doing that?

434
00:40:20,548 --> 00:40:21,331
Argo!

435
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,290
Hey!

436
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,643
Hey, I need to talk to you.

437
00:40:32,865 --> 00:40:33,605
Hi.

438
00:40:39,828 --> 00:40:41,134
Oh, god.

439
00:40:41,264 --> 00:40:42,091
What are those things
that everyone's eating?

440
00:40:45,007 --> 00:40:50,491
Mopani worms-- secondbest thing for a hangover.

441
00:40:50,622 --> 00:40:52,362
Oh.

442
00:40:52,493 --> 00:40:53,799
Ooh.

443
00:40:53,929 --> 00:40:57,585
Um, look-- I need your help.

444
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:00,980
Did you hear me?

445
00:41:04,244 --> 00:41:05,245
Christ, Mo!

446
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:08,466
You know, I don't get you.

447
00:41:08,596 --> 00:41:10,206
Have you always been
this much of an asshole,

448
00:41:10,337 --> 00:41:13,471
or did you take lessons?

449
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:15,777
Took lessons.

450
00:41:15,908 --> 00:41:18,519
The problem of land mineshasn't gotten any better

451
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,521
since your little boy died.OK?

452
00:41:20,652 --> 00:41:21,870
In fact, it's gotten worse.

453
00:41:26,222 --> 00:41:27,093
Look, lady.

454
00:41:30,183 --> 00:41:32,490
Every morning I have to
go out into that field

455
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:36,537
to make sure no little surpriseresurfaced during the night.

456
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:47,983
There's no making a
difference anymore.

457
00:41:48,114 --> 00:41:50,638
Angola is the wild
fucking West now.

458
00:41:50,769 --> 00:41:53,075
And it's gotten that
way all by itself.

459
00:41:53,206 --> 00:41:54,816
No, it didn't.

460
00:41:54,947 --> 00:41:56,557
I helped.

461
00:41:56,688 --> 00:41:58,951
That popper that I
tried to show you--

462
00:41:59,081 --> 00:42:00,866
I had a hand in creating it.

463
00:42:00,996 --> 00:42:04,826
It's the A6 butterfly.

464
00:42:04,957 --> 00:42:07,046
And I know it's here.

465
00:42:07,176 --> 00:42:09,352
Look, if I could just find oneand take it back to the states,

466
00:42:09,483 --> 00:42:11,311
then maybe that would
make a difference.

467
00:42:12,878 --> 00:42:13,705
Damn it, Argo.

468
00:42:13,835 --> 00:42:14,575
Quiet!

469
00:42:19,058 --> 00:42:21,364
Forget the damn dog!

470
00:42:21,495 --> 00:42:23,758
And forget making a difference.

471
00:42:23,889 --> 00:42:25,455
I desperately need your help.

472
00:42:25,586 --> 00:42:29,068
Look, I'll pay you, OK?

473
00:42:29,198 --> 00:42:32,332
$3,000 is all I've got.

474
00:42:32,462 --> 00:42:35,640
But it'll be enough to
drown yourself in this.

475
00:42:39,905 --> 00:42:40,601
Get the ball!

476
00:42:59,141 --> 00:43:00,012
Hey, hey, hey.

477
00:43:00,142 --> 00:43:01,535
Hey, watch out!

478
00:43:41,053 --> 00:43:42,750
I swept that field yesterday!

479
00:43:45,797 --> 00:43:46,624
Now will you help me?

480
00:43:53,935 --> 00:43:55,415
Let's go see
someone I can trust.

481
00:44:02,857 --> 00:44:04,729
Hey, Doc?

482
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:06,121
When did you collect
all this junk?

483
00:44:08,994 --> 00:44:10,865
In the four years
since we last hung out.

484
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:15,391
What's up, big guy?

485
00:44:15,522 --> 00:44:17,785
How you been?

486
00:44:17,916 --> 00:44:20,179
Good.

487
00:44:20,309 --> 00:44:23,269
These things will
stunt your growth.

488
00:44:23,399 --> 00:44:25,575
Nice hat.

489
00:44:25,706 --> 00:44:26,576
I'm Harper.

490
00:44:26,707 --> 00:44:27,447
You must be Michelle.

491
00:44:27,577 --> 00:44:28,753
We spoke on the phone.

492
00:44:28,883 --> 00:44:29,667
Yes.

493
00:44:31,538 --> 00:44:32,278
Wow.

494
00:44:32,408 --> 00:44:34,236
This is all you?

495
00:44:34,367 --> 00:44:35,629
This is amazing.

496
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,326
Yeah.

497
00:44:37,457 --> 00:44:40,678
This is me.

498
00:44:40,808 --> 00:44:44,116
I'm looking to
expand the program.

499
00:44:44,246 --> 00:44:50,862
Did you know that 10 Cambodiansstep on a popper every day?

500
00:44:50,992 --> 00:44:52,777
And what about here?

501
00:44:52,907 --> 00:44:56,781
Three-- reported,
which is about

502
00:44:56,911 --> 00:45:00,698
75 a day in a place
with the population

503
00:45:00,828 --> 00:45:01,568
of the United States.

504
00:45:04,571 --> 00:45:08,749
I'm looking for a new
American-made landmine.

505
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,579
You haven't heard aboutthe A6 butterfly, have you?

506
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:17,149
No new US-made land minesin Angola for three years now.

507
00:45:17,279 --> 00:45:20,456
Well, this one isn'tbeing exported by the US.

508
00:45:20,587 --> 00:45:23,111
It's being imported into the US.

509
00:45:23,242 --> 00:45:28,377
And we think that it's being
manufactured in Angola.

510
00:45:28,508 --> 00:45:30,640
That's crazy.

511
00:45:30,771 --> 00:45:33,905
Only two things made
in Angola these days--

512
00:45:34,035 --> 00:45:36,385
diamonds-- well, I
know they're not made--

513
00:45:36,516 --> 00:45:40,476
and prosthetic legs.

514
00:45:40,607 --> 00:45:44,350
Have you ever heard ofa guy named Michael Lewis?

515
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,396
He was last seen here in Angola.

516
00:45:47,527 --> 00:45:49,834
He's the creator of the A6.

517
00:45:49,964 --> 00:45:52,097
No.

518
00:45:52,227 --> 00:45:54,142
Why hasn't anyone
from the UN informed

519
00:45:54,273 --> 00:45:57,015
me about this, Ms. Flynn?

520
00:45:57,145 --> 00:46:04,457
Unless-- you working for
Uncle Sam now, big guy?

521
00:46:04,587 --> 00:46:08,548
Um, it was a covert
operation that--

522
00:46:08,678 --> 00:46:11,333
it went very wrong.

523
00:46:11,464 --> 00:46:14,423
I doubt the UN knows
squat right now.

524
00:46:14,554 --> 00:46:16,861
I barely know anything about it.

525
00:46:16,991 --> 00:46:18,906
Wow.

526
00:46:19,037 --> 00:46:22,083
A rogue land mine
being made and sold

527
00:46:22,214 --> 00:46:24,259
by a third world
country that can't even

528
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:26,653
keep its own shit straight?

529
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,611
If this is true, take
my advice-- be careful.

530
00:46:32,702 --> 00:46:33,965
As always.

531
00:46:34,095 --> 00:46:36,445
That's exactly what
I'm talking about, Ace.

532
00:46:36,576 --> 00:46:39,622
Dr. Hopper, come, come!

533
00:46:39,753 --> 00:46:41,102
Look-- I'll--

534
00:46:41,233 --> 00:46:43,191
I'll do whatever I can to help.

535
00:46:43,322 --> 00:46:45,106
Just-- Chris-- you
got to call me.

536
00:46:45,237 --> 00:46:46,281
Make sure that son
of a bitch still

537
00:46:46,412 --> 00:46:47,805
knows how to use a telephone.

538
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:55,290
How's he doing?

539
00:47:07,868 --> 00:47:09,391
Well, I haven't
been here since--

540
00:47:33,154 --> 00:47:37,115
If I can remember the
way I entered last time,

541
00:47:37,245 --> 00:47:38,856
I'll be able to
pick up the pattern.

542
00:47:46,341 --> 00:47:49,083
Point of entry--

543
00:47:49,214 --> 00:47:51,433
As in you're going in there?

544
00:47:51,564 --> 00:47:54,872
As in we're going in there.

545
00:48:01,313 --> 00:48:03,402
Step only where I step.

546
00:48:03,532 --> 00:48:06,057
Unless, of course,
I step on a popper.

547
00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:11,497
Oh, my God.

548
00:48:11,627 --> 00:48:12,890
The man made a joke.

549
00:48:51,885 --> 00:48:52,625
What?

550
00:48:58,283 --> 00:48:59,066
What is it?

551
00:49:03,723 --> 00:49:04,463
Hm?

552
00:49:16,301 --> 00:49:22,960
Last night at the bar,that sketch you showed me--

553
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:25,092
the one with the wings?

554
00:49:25,223 --> 00:49:26,572
You mean the one
you'd never seen before?

555
00:49:26,702 --> 00:49:27,442
I didn't say that.

556
00:49:36,408 --> 00:49:40,673
That day Johnny died,
I was onto something--

557
00:49:40,803 --> 00:49:46,418
right here, right before opened up on us.

558
00:49:46,548 --> 00:49:49,464
It was something I hadn't
seen before, something

559
00:49:49,595 --> 00:49:50,335
Argo didn't pick up--

560
00:49:53,207 --> 00:49:54,774
shaped like a wing.

561
00:49:54,904 --> 00:49:55,688
No.

562
00:49:55,818 --> 00:49:57,429
That's impossible.

563
00:49:57,559 --> 00:50:00,606
I mean, five years ago wewere still perfecting the A6.

564
00:50:00,736 --> 00:50:04,436
And PTC hadn't even
been tested yet.

565
00:50:04,566 --> 00:50:07,787
Gee, I wonder where you
can find a place to test

566
00:50:07,917 --> 00:50:11,617
a new kind of land mine.

567
00:50:11,747 --> 00:50:13,010
Here.

568
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,663
Bingo.

569
00:50:14,794 --> 00:50:17,014
That means that Lewis wasoperating ahead of schedule?

570
00:50:17,144 --> 00:50:19,233
No, I said bingo.

571
00:50:30,984 --> 00:50:32,464
Specs?

572
00:50:32,594 --> 00:50:34,988
Motion-activated, LEDindicates when it's tracking.

573
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,816
And if it were stillhot, we'd be dead by now.

574
00:50:39,862 --> 00:50:41,255
?

575
00:50:41,386 --> 00:50:45,825
There should be arelease plug underneath it.

576
00:50:45,955 --> 00:50:47,174
Time?

577
00:50:47,305 --> 00:50:49,350
15 seconds track,
one second to activate.

578
00:50:49,481 --> 00:50:53,093
Oh, and Christian-- she bounces.

579
00:50:53,224 --> 00:50:54,007
Figures.

580
00:51:03,495 --> 00:51:08,152
Oh, by the way, I thinksomeone's kind of after me.

581
00:51:15,246 --> 00:51:16,595
Shit!

582
00:51:16,725 --> 00:51:17,596
Oh, God.

583
00:51:17,726 --> 00:51:18,597
It's hot.

584
00:51:18,727 --> 00:51:21,165
And it's tracking.

585
00:51:21,295 --> 00:51:22,601
Oh, my God.

586
00:51:22,731 --> 00:51:24,124
It's going to pop.

587
00:51:24,255 --> 00:51:25,125
Give me a count.

588
00:51:25,256 --> 00:51:26,083
What?

589
00:51:26,213 --> 00:51:29,782
I said, give me a count.

590
00:51:29,912 --> 00:51:37,703
13, 12, 11, 10, nine--

591
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:42,577
Now turn it so
that it won't lock.

592
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:47,930
Seven, six, five--

593
00:51:48,061 --> 00:51:49,280
What the hell is this?

594
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:51,020
The pre-arming switch.

595
00:51:51,151 --> 00:51:51,978
Three!

596
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:52,935
Two!

597
00:51:53,066 --> 00:51:53,893
One!

598
00:51:54,023 --> 00:51:54,807
Bingo.

599
00:51:54,937 --> 00:51:55,895
Oh, Jesus.

600
00:52:11,954 --> 00:52:13,347
No way!

601
00:52:13,478 --> 00:52:14,305
I'm driving!

602
00:52:40,896 --> 00:52:42,289
You want to drive?

603
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:43,769
Then drive.

604
00:52:43,899 --> 00:52:44,857
Nice shot.

605
00:52:44,987 --> 00:52:45,771
Thanks.

606
00:52:57,957 --> 00:52:58,740
Where are they?

607
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,048
I don't know.

608
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,224
What do you mean
you don't know?

609
00:53:22,329 --> 00:53:23,200
There's a bridge ahead.

610
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:24,679
Should I take it?

611
00:53:31,338 --> 00:53:32,209
Look out!

612
00:54:11,726 --> 00:54:12,597
Good job.

613
00:54:12,727 --> 00:54:13,467
Thanks.

614
00:54:48,676 --> 00:54:50,548
Hey, cowboy!

615
00:54:50,678 --> 00:54:52,027
I want my diamonds back.

616
00:54:55,727 --> 00:54:56,510
Hit it!

617
00:55:41,686 --> 00:55:42,556
Pull out!
Pull out!

618
00:55:42,687 --> 00:55:43,427
Pull out!

619
00:56:01,053 --> 00:56:02,881
Someone's kind of after you?

620
00:56:11,106 --> 00:56:15,067
Of course-- that thing survived.

621
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:36,654
Let's go.

622
00:56:41,223 --> 00:56:44,096
By the way, I'm fine.
Thanks for asking.

623
00:57:34,363 --> 00:57:35,887
Oh, my God.

624
00:57:36,017 --> 00:57:37,845
What happened?

625
00:57:37,976 --> 00:57:38,803
Be careful.

626
00:57:38,933 --> 00:57:39,630
Stay there.

627
00:58:10,095 --> 00:58:10,878
Mo!

628
00:58:43,476 --> 00:58:44,259
Listen.

629
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:45,739
Listen.

630
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:46,566
Mo!

631
00:58:49,351 --> 00:58:51,658
Oh, God!

632
00:58:51,789 --> 00:58:52,572
Listen.

633
00:58:52,703 --> 00:58:54,313
I'm here, Mo.

634
00:58:54,443 --> 00:58:55,662
I want to take you to Hopper.

635
00:58:55,793 --> 00:58:56,968
Take you to a hospital.

636
00:58:57,098 --> 00:58:59,448
Listen.

637
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:01,886
You are--

638
00:59:19,773 --> 00:59:20,644
All right.

639
00:59:20,774 --> 00:59:21,732
Bring the bodies over here.

640
00:59:27,476 --> 00:59:29,087
All right.
Put them down there.

641
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:37,356
I just talked to Hopper.

642
00:59:37,486 --> 00:59:40,185
He's prepping thehospital for the wounded.

643
00:59:40,315 --> 00:59:41,534
He asked if you're OK.

644
01:00:00,422 --> 01:00:01,380
There's your mom.

645
01:00:05,514 --> 01:00:06,298
There she is.

646
01:00:09,257 --> 01:00:10,302
It's just her arm.

647
01:00:25,186 --> 01:00:26,318
I've got this one.

648
01:00:30,278 --> 01:00:31,932
Don't worry.

649
01:00:32,063 --> 01:00:34,239
I'm making sure your shipmentis leaving, as per schedule.

650
01:00:37,068 --> 01:00:40,854
There was nothing at his house.

651
01:00:40,985 --> 01:00:43,204
Well, she's booked
into the Gemstone.

652
01:00:43,335 --> 01:00:44,597
But I don't think she'll
go back there now.

653
01:00:52,997 --> 01:00:53,911
It was Yager.

654
01:00:54,041 --> 01:00:54,738
Are you sure?

655
01:01:00,134 --> 01:01:02,876
That was in Mo's
hand when he died.

656
01:01:03,007 --> 01:01:06,140
Consolidated Mines?

657
01:01:06,271 --> 01:01:10,101
I'm leaving tomorrow.

658
01:01:10,231 --> 01:01:11,058
Come with me.

659
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:20,372
Look, if it was them.

660
01:01:20,502 --> 01:01:23,114
They'll be gunning for you next.

661
01:01:23,244 --> 01:01:24,550
Let 'em come.

662
01:01:29,511 --> 01:01:31,992
You be a good boy.

663
01:01:32,123 --> 01:01:33,080
Daddy's going to work.

664
01:04:06,407 --> 01:04:07,191
Oh, uh.

665
01:04:29,996 --> 01:04:30,779
Ooh!

666
01:04:35,393 --> 01:04:36,220
Uh.

667
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,229
Uh.

668
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:46,230
Ah!

669
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:47,231
Ah!

670
01:04:47,361 --> 01:04:48,232
Aw!

671
01:04:48,362 --> 01:04:49,233
Aw!

672
01:04:49,363 --> 01:04:50,103
Uh.

673
01:05:52,252 --> 01:05:53,079
What am I doing?

674
01:07:51,154 --> 01:07:52,764
Hey, kid.

675
01:07:52,894 --> 01:07:55,897
Did you see who took her?

676
01:07:56,028 --> 01:07:59,162
Was it Yager?

677
01:07:59,292 --> 01:08:00,511
Did you see where they took her?

678
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:19,007
Do you know what this is?

679
01:08:23,577 --> 01:08:24,883
Can you take me there?

680
01:08:44,685 --> 01:08:46,861
Bring her down below.

681
01:08:46,992 --> 01:08:48,385
Well, she's here all right.

682
01:08:53,433 --> 01:08:55,609
Do these places have back doors?

683
01:09:04,096 --> 01:09:05,750
I've retrieved this landmine.

684
01:09:09,406 --> 01:09:10,885
So you just tell me
where Erickson is,

685
01:09:11,016 --> 01:09:12,974
and then we don't have
to do any of this.

686
01:09:16,413 --> 01:09:20,025
He's on his way to
kick your fucking ass.

687
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:23,507
What a mouth!

688
01:09:28,425 --> 01:09:29,513
Kiss your mother
with that mouth?

689
01:09:29,643 --> 01:09:30,427
Enough.

690
01:09:43,309 --> 01:09:51,926
Death tiptoes lightly withrude surprises in his hands.

691
01:09:55,365 --> 01:09:56,279
I know.

692
01:09:56,409 --> 01:10:00,718
It's so dramatic, this place.

693
01:10:00,848 --> 01:10:01,806
Where's Christian?

694
01:10:09,901 --> 01:10:10,945
This is what you
call a back door?

695
01:10:31,705 --> 01:10:33,185
No elevators, huh?

696
01:10:37,102 --> 01:10:42,063
Yager here is going to tortureyou until I find out exactly

697
01:10:42,194 --> 01:10:44,109
what your operation was about.

698
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,111
I told you.

699
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,940
I was just along to confirmthe type of landmine.

700
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:52,291
While he's doing
that, I'll be topside,

701
01:10:52,422 --> 01:10:54,511
making sure my shipment
gets off on time.

702
01:10:54,641 --> 01:10:58,863
Now if you tell Yager whathe wants to hear, then maybe

703
01:10:58,993 --> 01:11:04,260
I'll come back down in time tostop him from slowly sucking

704
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:06,131
the air out of your lungs.

705
01:11:14,531 --> 01:11:16,533
Promise I'll be back.

706
01:11:22,843 --> 01:11:23,757
Just stay here.

707
01:11:39,164 --> 01:11:40,992
Ah!

708
01:11:41,122 --> 01:11:41,993
He's just doing his job.

709
01:11:57,530 --> 01:11:58,879
Make sure it's nice and tight.

710
01:12:43,228 --> 01:12:45,535
What does the US know aboutConsolidated Mines involvement

711
01:12:45,665 --> 01:12:46,971
in the A6 --

712
01:12:47,101 --> 01:12:48,407
Hey!

713
01:12:48,538 --> 01:12:49,365
I'll kill him.

714
01:12:49,495 --> 01:12:50,278
I'll kill him.

715
01:12:55,501 --> 01:12:58,852
Fucking .

716
01:12:58,983 --> 01:13:01,812
Do it.

717
01:13:01,942 --> 01:13:02,813
Now drop it.

718
01:13:36,281 --> 01:13:39,153
Four more, please.

719
01:13:39,284 --> 01:13:40,459
We have to put them
on first before we

720
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:43,636
get the other on top of them.

721
01:13:43,767 --> 01:13:47,510
It is the only way to
make the boat stable.

722
01:13:57,215 --> 01:13:57,955
Yager, it's time.

723
01:13:58,085 --> 01:13:58,869
Let's go.

724
01:14:01,524 --> 01:14:02,263
Yager?

725
01:16:04,951 --> 01:16:06,300
Hey, .

726
01:16:13,612 --> 01:16:14,352
What the hell's going on?

727
01:16:17,703 --> 01:16:19,313
She got away.

728
01:16:19,444 --> 01:16:20,358
Jesus Christ!

729
01:16:20,488 --> 01:16:21,620
What the hell's gotten into you?

730
01:16:21,751 --> 01:16:22,621
I swear!

731
01:16:22,752 --> 01:16:23,666
She can't go anywhere, man!

732
01:16:28,018 --> 01:16:29,846
We'll find her.

733
01:16:29,976 --> 01:16:30,760
You'd better.

734
01:16:34,198 --> 01:16:35,112
Hey, you!

735
01:16:35,242 --> 01:16:36,156
Go back down to .

736
01:16:36,287 --> 01:16:38,550
You, Carlos-- you come with me.

737
01:16:38,681 --> 01:16:40,291
Make sure she doesn't
get to the plant.

738
01:16:47,994 --> 01:16:48,734
Ah!

739
01:16:52,912 --> 01:16:54,261
Uh!

740
01:16:55,349 --> 01:16:56,133
Ew!

741
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,224
Oh!

742
01:17:02,966 --> 01:17:03,706
Oh!

743
01:17:28,861 --> 01:17:29,601
Ah!

744
01:18:00,153 --> 01:18:01,981
I should be used
to this by now.

745
01:18:28,094 --> 01:18:29,835
Don't move.

746
01:18:29,966 --> 01:18:33,447
I said-- Uh!

747
01:18:34,492 --> 01:18:35,362
Ooh!

748
01:18:35,493 --> 01:18:36,233
Ah!

749
01:18:46,417 --> 01:18:47,157
Oh!

750
01:18:55,905 --> 01:18:56,775
Christian?

751
01:18:56,906 --> 01:18:57,733
It's Hopper.

752
01:19:10,484 --> 01:19:12,617
So where are we going?

753
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:13,792
Going to see my
old friend, Hopper.

754
01:19:34,465 --> 01:19:35,205
Dead.

755
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:41,167
Get after them!

756
01:19:58,184 --> 01:19:59,011
Oh, my God.

757
01:20:05,713 --> 01:20:08,673
What do you see
when you look at me?

758
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:10,414
Yourself, that's what.

759
01:20:13,852 --> 01:20:17,682
We're both survivors, Erickson,cut from the same mold.

760
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:21,381
We just chose different
paths to get here.

761
01:20:21,512 --> 01:20:24,297
No.

762
01:20:24,428 --> 01:20:27,910
You're just a mercenary.

763
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:32,566
Right or wrong don't matterto you, just the prize.

764
01:20:32,697 --> 01:20:37,093
The only justificationfor revolution is success.

765
01:20:37,223 --> 01:20:40,705
And to be successful,
it takes money.

766
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:43,186
That's why I'm
nothing like you.

767
01:20:43,316 --> 01:20:44,752
Oh, yeah?

768
01:20:44,883 --> 01:20:45,666
Then show me.

769
01:20:45,797 --> 01:20:46,537
Oh!

770
01:21:00,333 --> 01:21:01,117
Pull out.

771
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:06,600
OK.

772
01:21:06,731 --> 01:21:07,514
Oh.

773
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:48,729
Still not convinced?

774
01:21:51,645 --> 01:21:55,301
I'll give you some
time to think about it.

775
01:22:11,448 --> 01:22:12,884
No one rides for free.

776
01:22:45,525 --> 01:22:46,309
Oh!

777
01:23:01,019 --> 01:23:01,759
Ooh!

778
01:23:03,891 --> 01:23:06,764
Ah!

779
01:23:19,342 --> 01:23:21,300
Ah!

780
01:23:21,431 --> 01:23:22,214
Ooh!

781
01:23:46,325 --> 01:23:48,197
Ow!

782
01:24:14,397 --> 01:24:15,093
Oh.

783
01:24:20,446 --> 01:24:23,710
So are you OK?

784
01:24:23,841 --> 01:24:25,190
Oh, the train.

785
01:24:32,328 --> 01:24:33,155
Wait here.

786
01:24:55,742 --> 01:24:57,092
Wait here, my ass.

787
01:25:02,793 --> 01:25:03,576
Ooh!

788
01:26:59,562 --> 01:27:00,345
Oh!

789
01:27:03,566 --> 01:27:04,306
Oh!

790
01:27:07,483 --> 01:27:08,353
Ooh!

791
01:27:19,451 --> 01:27:21,453
Oh!

792
01:27:21,584 --> 01:27:22,324
Oh!

793
01:28:14,376 --> 01:28:16,421
Stupid fucking bloodhound!

794
01:28:16,552 --> 01:28:21,426
One squeeze

795
01:28:21,557 --> 01:28:22,601
You're always !

796
01:28:25,212 --> 01:28:28,564
Your boy?

797
01:28:28,694 --> 01:28:30,043
Johnny?

798
01:28:30,174 --> 01:28:33,569
He wasn't meant to be there.

799
01:28:33,699 --> 01:28:34,570
It was an accident.

800
01:28:35,658 --> 01:28:36,876
Oh!

801
01:28:37,007 --> 01:28:39,183
You should have
left, Christian.

802
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:42,055
It wouldn't have come to this.

803
01:28:45,145 --> 01:28:47,234
You planted that mine.

804
01:28:47,365 --> 01:28:49,324
Yeah, it was me.

805
01:28:49,454 --> 01:28:50,934
It was me all along--

806
01:28:51,064 --> 01:28:53,415
purely business, Ace.

807
01:28:53,545 --> 01:28:57,984
You see, what better way totest an invisible landmine

808
01:28:58,115 --> 01:29:06,297
than to see if the best sweeperin the free world can find it.

809
01:29:07,429 --> 01:29:08,299
Ah!

810
01:29:08,430 --> 01:29:10,301
Oh!

811
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:16,263
Oh.

812
01:30:19,283 --> 01:30:21,416
Oh, OK, Ace.

813
01:30:21,546 --> 01:30:24,157
I-- I guess this is it.

814
01:30:24,288 --> 01:30:25,028
Go on.

815
01:30:25,158 --> 01:30:28,161
Go on to him, boy.

816
01:30:28,292 --> 01:30:32,078
Angels can fly because theytake themselves so lightly.

817
01:30:33,123 --> 01:30:33,863
Oh!

818
01:30:39,303 --> 01:30:40,913
Did that hurt, buddy?

819
01:30:44,613 --> 01:30:46,963
You know, you should
have looked out for me,

820
01:30:47,093 --> 01:30:50,445
Christian, just a little better.

821
01:30:54,318 --> 01:30:56,929
Now let's see if you are
really big enough to go

822
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:58,191
through the gates of hell.

823
01:31:04,284 --> 01:31:05,155
Ooh.

824
01:31:05,285 --> 01:31:06,069
Oh.

825
01:32:33,330 --> 01:32:34,113
You OK?

826
01:32:38,509 --> 01:32:41,077
I thought you guys
might need a ride.

827
01:32:41,207 --> 01:32:42,295
Thanks.

828
01:32:42,426 --> 01:32:45,385
But this time, I
think I'll drive.
