00:00:32,897 --> 00:00:38,630
#EXECUTIVE TARGET#

2
00:00:45,382 --> 00:00:48,813
You asked my advice Mr. President
and all I’m saying...

3
00:00:48,897 --> 00:00:52,583
All you're saying Mack,is that I should
screw my conscience, along with about

4
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:58,104
two hundred and fifty million people, in
order to save a few jobs in an elitist group,

5
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:01,457
primarily made up of people who are
still living in fantasy land!

6
00:01:02,703 --> 00:01:05,602
Now I didn't become the president of
the United States to make friends, Mack.

7
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:08,810
God knows if i wanted to do that, I
would have stayed in New Jersey.

8
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:14,436
I took this position to do the best job
I could for the good of the whole country.

9
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:18,435
I'm just saying it shouldn't be so drastic,
for security reasons.

10
00:01:18,484 --> 00:01:23,618
Look I can no longer justify spending
billions of dollars on ludicrous projects

11
00:01:23,694 --> 00:01:26,194
with people walking around the streets
homeless and hungry.

12
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:35,574
With all due respect Mr.President I don't
think security of the country is ludicrous.

13
00:01:35,741 --> 00:01:41,455
Mack you're a good solder. The security of
the country is what it is cause men like you.

14
00:01:42,521 --> 00:01:46,187
I'm just hoping that if we move towards a
better tomorrow, somebody will say that

15
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,644
that was the responsibility of me.
- I hope so too.

16
00:01:50,494 --> 00:01:53,628
Mr. President they're ready for you, sir.
- Thank you.

17
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:58,468
Come on. This is gonna be
hard enough to pass as it is.

18
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:01,391
I'm gonna need you to cover my ass in
this one partner.

19
00:02:01,624 --> 00:02:04,791
I'm gonna need your help!
- Yes sir, let's do it!

20
00:02:09,752 --> 00:02:12,889
I like to thank you all for attending what
I’m sure will be historic event.

21
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,279
Our guest today is a man who was
elected four short years ago on a platform

22
00:02:17,366 --> 00:02:22,442
of returning government to the people. In
those 4 years he has exceeded this promise.

23
00:02:23,647 --> 00:02:28,005
Today he will unveil a new plan which will
launch us into the next century as a nation

24
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:33,835
devoted of poverty and fear. A nation willing
to take the next great step forward.

25
00:02:35,193 --> 00:02:38,686
The city of New York is proudly chosen as our
beautiful city, is the launching path

26
00:02:38,763 --> 00:02:44,337
for this new journey,so ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States.

27
00:02:45,005 --> 00:02:49,176
Thank you. Thank you.

28
00:02:50,622 --> 00:02:53,122
Thank you very much.

29
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:56,699
I'm sure that most of you
know why I’m here today.

30
00:02:57,931 --> 00:03:03,312
In fact Washington has never been known for
keeping secrets. I tell my security people

31
00:03:03,465 --> 00:03:07,546
that if they want to study infiltration
techniques just keep on eye on the press.

32
00:03:10,152 --> 00:03:12,652
I'm going to lay some rumors to rest.

33
00:03:12,662 --> 00:03:16,823
This is going to be a step on a long journey
that is not without detractors.

34
00:03:18,415 --> 00:03:20,915
I'm here to ask for youre support.

35
00:03:21,682 --> 00:03:26,848
We all know the cuts have to be made. The
high paranoid spending of the eighties

36
00:03:26,929 --> 00:03:31,967
is no longer acceptable in the nineties.
Star Wars belongs in the movies,

37
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:36,978
and should be financed by Hollywood, not
Washington and the American people!

38
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:54,206
The American people can no longer justify
letting things like education,environment,

39
00:03:54,786 --> 00:04:00,600
social security medical fall on the wayside,
while billions of dollars are being spent

40
00:04:01,056 --> 00:04:05,031
for six hundred and fifty dollar
toilet seats ordered by the Pentagon.

41
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,596
It's time to start spending our money in the
right places,the essential places.

42
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:15,319
Now we owe this to our children.We owe this
to the children of the world.

43
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:19,180
America is a leader a super
power and a super power

44
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:22,806
should not only be strong in the skies,
it should be strong on the ground.

45
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,418
However I’m not for a
moment going to sacrifice

46
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:33,348
the safety of the land we live in, nor the
freedoms that we so cherish,

47
00:04:34,337 --> 00:04:38,110
but it is time to get our priorities in
order.

48
00:04:38,443 --> 00:04:44,235
Quit a moving speech Mr.President full of
usual drama, short on down home intelligence.

49
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:47,302
Returning the government to the people come
on! I ask you this California,

50
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:50,725
are you going to allow some bleeding heart
president to cut thousands

51
00:04:50,821 --> 00:04:54,609
of your defense industry jobs so he can take
your wages and disperse them among

52
00:04:54,681 --> 00:04:57,637
dead beets who haven't worked a day in their
life? Give me a call here

53
00:04:57,692 --> 00:05:01,919
on crn the station which stricks to the
politics. Hello you're on crn who’s this?

54
00:05:02,008 --> 00:05:05,113
Betsy - What do you have to say Betsy?
- I think that cutting military budget

55
00:05:05,114 --> 00:05:08,299
and giving the money back to the
people is a really nice thing to do.

56
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,719
You call throwing thousands of your
fellow Californians out of work nice!

57
00:05:17,163 --> 00:05:19,663
There's our boy.

58
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,981
Yeah.
- Chicken's in the coup.

59
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:38,794
Let's go!

60
00:05:38,795 --> 00:05:41,129
We agree that the defense
industry provides over

61
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,177
a hundred thousand jobs in
the state of California... - Right!

62
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:47,849
Hay will you turn that ass whole off! - Hay
you ought to knock it off you fuckin nut,

63
00:05:47,925 --> 00:05:51,434
before i come back there and kick your ass!
- The only time you'd have the guts

64
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:55,663
is when I have these fuckin things on.
- I'm telling you shut up!

65
00:05:56,324 --> 00:05:58,824
Fuck you!

66
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:02,243
Fuck you too!

67
00:06:02,244 --> 00:06:05,611
What they say is meaningless, which is why
what they don't say is most important

68
00:06:05,869 --> 00:06:08,369
Next caller, hello you're on crn.

69
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,030
Christ!

70
00:06:54,608 --> 00:06:58,968

involved in a major accident

71
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:01,725

00:07:05,935 --> 00:07:08,737
Ah shit!

00:07:57,636 --> 00:08:00,136

82
00:10:01,002 --> 00:10:04,198
What the fuck were you just doing?

00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:17,958
He's a professional stunt car driver, if
I could do what he we wouldn’t needs him.

86
00:10:21,077 --> 00:10:23,979
Christ! - You're losing him; you’re

87
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,480
Watch out!

88
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,263
Fuck.

89
00:10:39,578 --> 00:10:42,078

00:11:20,134 --> 00:11:24,850

94
00:11:26,443 --> 00:11:29,315
What now Einstien?
- Just let me think a second.

95
00:12:41,464 --> 00:12:43,964
Heading west on stellar

00:12:51,225 --> 00:12:55,149
Hey wait! Stay there!

97
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,160
What are you doing?

98
00:15:52,747 --> 00:15:56,015
Whoever ambushed this bus obviously
wanted one of 'em real bad.

99
00:15:57,124 --> 00:16:01,110
Here's a list of the thirteen that got away.
Headquarters is running a background check

100
00:16:01,225 --> 00:16:05,468
on their family and friends.We should be able
to catch most of those geniuses that way.

101
00:16:07,254 --> 00:16:10,256
Give Carelli and Smith half the list,
you and me will take the other half.

102
00:16:12,707 --> 00:16:15,207
So we do six.

103
00:16:56,194 --> 00:17:00,528
Do you like dusting today?
Bella,I wore this especially for you.

104
00:17:03,087 --> 00:17:05,587
Mersey boque.

105
00:17:20,454 --> 00:17:24,052
If my wife was as beautiful
as you I’d still be married.

106
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,027
If your wife was as beautiful as me,
she never would have married you.

107
00:17:30,927 --> 00:17:36,661
I gotta tell you, self-control is not my
strong point.- Well I’ll take care of that.

108
00:17:37,065 --> 00:17:39,588
Really?
Well thank you.

109
00:17:42,174 --> 00:17:46,214
You're hurting me. - Haven’t I told you a
million times, no touching the customers!

110
00:17:46,249 --> 00:17:48,439
Pal, take it easy will ya?
We were just kidding around.

111
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,809
You sit down!You sit down! - Hey, hey hey,
don’t you touch me! - You're outta here!

112
00:17:59,268 --> 00:18:02,782
What the fuck, you go! Hey fuck you too!

113
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,880
Fuckin bastered,

00:18:14,111 --> 00:18:17,525
fuckin prick. Bitch.

115
00:18:18,406 --> 00:18:23,287
Bela! - Fuck. You scared the shit out of
me. - I need some help.

116
00:18:24,734 --> 00:18:28,198
No shit. For life, five minutes
ago where the hell were ya?

117
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:33,254
Here waiting for you. You gotta
car? - Yeah down the block.

118
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:37,339
What the hell you doing?
- Get me outta here would you?

119
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,585
I like that outfit. I
like the matching cuffs.

120
00:18:52,462 --> 00:18:55,793
Come on! Want a beer?

121
00:18:58,933 --> 00:19:02,716
I don't want to be rude, but I’d like to get
rid of these first if you don't mind?

122
00:19:02,961 --> 00:19:06,478
What's a matter, bondage is not
your style? - Na.

123
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:13,089
Well nothing much has
changed around here

124
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,080
What, you think I be gone too far?

125
00:19:24,825 --> 00:19:30,348
Is that what you think? - I don't know.
Yeah maybe a little.

126
00:19:32,168 --> 00:19:37,581
Those are for safety wise guy. Some woman
locked me to that bed one night, six hours.

127
00:19:37,823 --> 00:19:41,997
Had to call in the neighbors to help me, it
was embarrassing as hell.

128
00:19:43,366 --> 00:19:45,866
They think I’m a fuckin pervert.

129
00:19:49,743 --> 00:19:52,506
What’re you doing ha?
- I'm gonna cut them off

130
00:19:53,037 --> 00:19:57,812
Those are good cuffs, you're
gonna ruin them? - Get me out!

131
00:20:11,781 --> 00:20:14,281
I sure missed you Bela.

132
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:18,333
You to my man.
- It's good to be back.

133
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:22,705
Still working on the gas formula?

134
00:20:22,706 --> 00:20:26,867
You bet. I'm getting'close too. Pretty soon
I’ll have the best fuel

135
00:20:26,923 --> 00:20:29,252
the stock car world has ever known.

136
00:20:29,253 --> 00:20:32,978
"Bela's brew" I’m gonna
call it... Be famous.Be rich.

137
00:20:34,104 --> 00:20:37,800
Buy my own strip joint.
Have a seat partner,

138
00:20:43,138 --> 00:20:45,638
here put your feet up, and ha come on!

139
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:51,268
Come on! - Have you seen her?
Have you spoken to her?

140
00:20:52,342 --> 00:20:54,959
Not since the last time I banged her.
- Is that supposed to be funny?

141
00:20:56,187 --> 00:20:58,687
I'm talking about my wife!
- I know.

142
00:21:02,258 --> 00:21:04,549
Come on, don't tell you've
lost your sense of humor.

143
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:10,035
May be I did, along with my self-respect,
dignity. - That's what she lost!

144
00:21:10,915 --> 00:21:13,415
Why don't you just go ahead and pick
my heart out when you're done with that

145
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,009
It'd be fair play...

146
00:21:16,044 --> 00:21:18,285
So... You don't know
who these people were?

147
00:21:18,286 --> 00:21:23,624
I have no idea. One minute I’m on the bus,
next thing I know the fuckin thing turns over,

148
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:27,812
these people come rushing in their putting
guns to my face. There's cops everywhere,

149
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:32,626
they hustle me out of the bus, everybody is
shooting. I jumped in a car and i took off,

150
00:21:33,076 --> 00:21:35,978
I don't know what the hell was going on!
- Life is such an adventure ain't it?

151
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:39,292
Yeah!

152
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:43,728
What're you gonna do now?
- I'm gonna turn myself in...

153
00:21:43,729 --> 00:21:46,573
I got a year left and I’m gonna do it.

154
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:52,160
Then why'd we bother removing these?
- Because I want to see Nadia.

155
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:57,768
Nick you know... - I never had a chance to
explain myself.

156
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,619
That prosecutor had t in for me from
the get go. - Ah come on Nicky, fact it.

157
00:22:03,945 --> 00:22:06,997
You got caught with your hand in the cookie
jar. Everybody knows you've been

158
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:09,847
screwing ‘around on her for months. I mean
the only way you ever get her listen to you

159
00:22:09,904 --> 00:22:15,779
is to tie her up, and you say you're not into
that, so... - Let me tell you one thing,

160
00:22:16,853 --> 00:22:21,155
I love my wife more than anything else
in the whole world and I miss her Bela

161
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:26,754
and I gotta see her no matter what.I don't
know who these people are or what the fuck

162
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:31,453
they want from me, but I’m gonna go see her!
- The least you can do

163
00:22:31,502 --> 00:22:35,944
is make a better appearance... A man
is often judged by his clothes...

164
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:42,543
I'll lend you some of mine.
- Yeah but no polyester.

165
00:22:46,082 --> 00:22:48,771
Who's next?
- Nick James.

166
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:53,665
Is that the same Hollywood stunt driver
James? - Vic, what's wrong?

167
00:22:56,669 --> 00:23:00,764
The jerkoff had a great career go in' till he
got busted with an eighteen year old girl

168
00:23:00,822 --> 00:23:06,384
with a purse full of cocaine. Blowed his
whole life. Stupid bastard...

169
00:23:08,765 --> 00:23:14,730
What's the address?
- Last address is 8487 West Alvarado.

170
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,885
Hi ya baby.

171
00:24:17,424 --> 00:24:21,219
I love people with habits.
- What took you so long Nicky boy?

172
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:25,887
Men are so predictable.
- So are cops.

173
00:24:26,055 --> 00:24:29,697
Fuck! Get rid of them!
Don ho you come with me!

174
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:33,550
Now listen to me all right? I want
you to answer the door.

175
00:24:34,504 --> 00:24:38,274
You get rid of these fuckin'cops and nothing
is gonna happen to you, let's go!

176
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:42,249
I'm not joking around with you don't
be foolish!

177
00:24:44,686 --> 00:24:47,186
Nick?

178
00:24:50,745 --> 00:24:54,449
Good evening mam, I’m officer Smoke,
this is my partner officer Green.

179
00:24:55,044 --> 00:24:57,544
I'm sorry to bother you, but
we'd like to ask you a few questions.

180
00:24:58,685 --> 00:25:01,185
About what?
- Your husband

181
00:25:01,258 --> 00:25:06,078
My husband? I haven't spoken to my husband
in almost a year... I really wouldn't know..

182
00:25:06,527 --> 00:25:11,223
We don't mean to alarm you but, your
husband escaped tonight. - Escaped?

183
00:25:11,979 --> 00:25:14,479
Do you think we would step in for a
minute?

184
00:25:15,057 --> 00:25:19,742
It's so late and I was about to go to bed...
- We'll just be a minute. I promise.

185
00:25:20,913 --> 00:25:25,157
I'm sorry I, I can't let you in, unless you
have warrant. - We have a warrant mam.

186
00:25:41,804 --> 00:25:44,653
Yeah we're trying to gather as much
information from the lab as we can.

187
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:49,768
The lab? Well who do you think did it, his
wife? She's never been arrested for so much

188
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:53,490
as stealing a piece of chewing gum. Why
should she suddenly just blow away two cops?

189
00:25:54,781 --> 00:25:59,622
Na it was Nick James for sure and I
want that bastard alive!

190
00:26:00,045 --> 00:26:04,354
Well I’ll put an apb on it
immediately - Brilliant idea.

191
00:26:11,784 --> 00:26:15,605
Do I, do I at least get
a chance to plead my case.

192
00:26:16,891 --> 00:26:19,301
You know even murderers get to do that.

193
00:26:19,336 --> 00:26:22,949
Right on, brother.
- Honey look

194
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:26,550
I met this girl once before that. Once.

195
00:26:28,534 --> 00:26:32,574
I had no idea what she had in her purse...
She begged me for a ride,

196
00:26:33,323 --> 00:26:36,585
that's all there was to it. - Oh, please,
please, please, please, please.

197
00:26:37,534 --> 00:26:40,227
Shut the fuck up! - Oh please, please,
please, ple...

198
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:43,313
Hey shut up! You're bothering me
now. - Why? You want to hear this shit?

199
00:26:43,665 --> 00:26:48,497
Yeah, I’m a sentimentalist.
- So where are you taking us anyway?

200
00:26:50,468 --> 00:26:52,968
To see da'man.

201
00:27:14,022 --> 00:27:17,046
Here we are home sweet home, now
let's go, come on.

202
00:27:19,881 --> 00:27:26,185
What the hell is this the bat cave? - Ever
heard of area 54, well this is area 55.

203
00:27:26,446 --> 00:27:29,482
Shut up you big mouth
- What?

204
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:41,890
Hey Nick James, hey
everybody it's Nick James.

205
00:27:42,092 --> 00:27:44,592
Hey Nick, how you doing?

206
00:27:45,974 --> 00:27:49,424
You know I cannot tell you what an honor and
a pleasure it is to finally meet you in person.

207
00:27:49,955 --> 00:27:53,955
I've watched your entire career.
I trust your trip wasn't too unbearable.

208
00:27:56,886 --> 00:28:02,532
I'm Lamar, oh I’m sorry is that any way to
treat guests? Take those cuffs off!

209
00:28:15,934 --> 00:28:21,744
Look what the fuck is going on?
- Patience Nick, everything in time.

210
00:28:22,883 --> 00:28:26,320
Well fuck you, the time is now! I'd
like to know what we're doing here.

211
00:28:26,351 --> 00:28:30,320
What do you want with us? - Look Nick,
let's not get our relationship started

212
00:28:30,344 --> 00:28:33,335
out on the wrong foot. Go make her
comfortable!

213
00:28:35,188 --> 00:28:37,575
Nick? - Hey!
- Look it's gonna be fine.

214
00:28:37,576 --> 00:28:39,696
Where are you taking her?
- Don't worry Nicky boy,

215
00:28:39,697 --> 00:28:43,715
I’ll take care of her like she was my own.
- You're gonna get your mother fucker.

216
00:28:44,054 --> 00:28:47,857
Keep an eye on him,make sure she's ok. She's
gonna be fine, everything is gonna be fine.

217
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:51,203
Look, look let's go play a game,

218
00:28:51,989 --> 00:28:55,243
it's good for relaxing
the tension come on.

219
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,850
Come on!
- I don't like games!

220
00:29:06,084 --> 00:29:08,894
See, the whole city.

221
00:29:11,109 --> 00:29:13,885
Quite an expensive little hobby
you got going on here for yourself.

222
00:29:15,197 --> 00:29:17,697
I guess we're gonna play a game?

223
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:23,202
Cops and robbers. The red
one is you, the robber.

224
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:27,428
The objective is as in
life, to avoid destruction.

225
00:29:30,438 --> 00:29:32,938
I'm ready when you are Mr.James.

226
00:29:35,424 --> 00:29:37,924
Let's hit it!

227
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:46,883
Be careful Nick there are booby traps.

228
00:29:56,869 --> 00:29:59,369
Catch up Nick, catch up!

229
00:30:05,885 --> 00:30:10,604
Watch out for that car Nick.Ah, shit!

230
00:30:15,403 --> 00:30:17,903
I guess I win.

231
00:30:18,765 --> 00:30:23,078
You know I always wondered if
you guys can drive a car as well

232
00:30:23,149 --> 00:30:27,721
on the streets as you do in the movies.
- Let's not forget I lost those two jerks

233
00:30:27,756 --> 00:30:32,602
you had following me, didn't I? - Well
I hope for your sake you'll be able

234
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:36,768
to duplicate that feat. - All right come on,
tell me what you want?

235
00:30:39,467 --> 00:30:45,318
We've been experiencing a little cash flow
problem, but luckily there's a bank

236
00:30:45,362 --> 00:30:50,432
that will help us replenish our finances.
- What's that got to do with me?

237
00:30:51,743 --> 00:30:57,279
You're gonna drive the getaway car! - I ain't
driving a getaway car and you can't make me!

238
00:30:58,828 --> 00:31:03,163
Well no I can't, but your heart can.

239
00:31:04,052 --> 00:31:07,805
She'll be in the next room waiting
patiently for your triumphant return.

240
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:13,940
Now should you not return
or become disagreeable,

241
00:31:15,546 --> 00:31:21,152
she still die. But enough shop talk, why
don't you go and see Nadia.

242
00:31:21,221 --> 00:31:24,608
I'm sure she'll want you to tell her that
everything's going to be just fine.

243
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,320
Hey beautiful.

244
00:31:38,464 --> 00:31:42,908
Baby you gotta learn how to relax women,

245
00:31:44,783 --> 00:31:48,869
bay be that hubby of your wouldn't stay down
 that other path. - Get your hands off of me!

246
00:31:51,887 --> 00:31:55,700
Well if it ain't Rudolph Vazaleno. - That's
pretty funny.

247
00:31:57,116 --> 00:32:00,442
Think I could have a moment alone with my
wife? - I don't know Nicky boy,

248
00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:06,275
I don't think! She likes you anymore.
- Yeah, where we gonna go?

249
00:32:06,613 --> 00:32:09,565
We can't get out of here.
- All right Ripple let's go!

250
00:32:10,283 --> 00:32:13,971
May be you should talk to dr. Ruth, I
heard she's god about things like this.

251
00:32:14,451 --> 00:32:18,329
Yeah you probably got her number. Could you
get her something to wear maybe?

252
00:32:24,972 --> 00:32:29,965
Oh man Nadia?
- Don't even try it Nick.

253
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:37,361
Why couldn't you just brake out of
jail and run off of Mexico somewhere!

254
00:32:37,511 --> 00:32:40,517
Haven't you done me enough damage?
Did you have to drag me into this,

255
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:44,714
whatever the hell this place is?
- I don't know who these people are?

256
00:32:45,511 --> 00:32:47,899
Then why are we being held
here like animals Nick?

257
00:32:48,092 --> 00:32:51,060
You had to have some kind of dealings with
them. - I swear to god

258
00:32:51,183 --> 00:32:53,595
I don't know who they are! - God dam
it Nick, what is it that they want?

259
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:57,538
Can you at least hav the decency to tell me
that much? Well? Do you?

260
00:32:58,473 --> 00:33:02,073
You wanna know? - Yeah. - You
really want to know? - Yeah I do.

261
00:33:02,535 --> 00:33:05,035
You want to know what they want.
- Yeah.

262
00:33:06,198 --> 00:33:08,698
They want me to rob a bank.

263
00:33:11,314 --> 00:33:14,676
Not me actually, but they want
me to drive the getaway car.

264
00:33:15,488 --> 00:33:20,276
Are you crazy? - The only thing I’m crazy
about is you. - Oh Nick, please...

265
00:33:25,889 --> 00:33:28,389
Yeah.

266
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:32,188
Look you hired me to do ajob and it
will be done, I promise it will be done!

267
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:39,058
Everything all right?
- No, everything's not okay!

268
00:33:40,995 --> 00:33:44,226
How in the hell could you let that happen
over at Nadia’s? - It was a...

269
00:33:44,271 --> 00:33:46,544
It was a fuck up!

270
00:33:47,122 --> 00:33:51,694
I told you I didn't want any attention
drawn to Nick James, didn't I?

271
00:33:52,526 --> 00:33:55,931
Nothing what so ever, that would draw him
back to us, what so ever.

272
00:33:57,032 --> 00:34:00,361
I mean do you know how long it took me
to find the right man. To find him?

273
00:34:02,261 --> 00:34:04,761
Ripple just gets a little carried
away sometimes. - I am not finished!

274
00:34:08,636 --> 00:34:14,345
Anonymity and precision are
the key elements to our success.

275
00:34:14,381 --> 00:34:17,143
Without them we won't be
able to spend a fuckin dime.

276
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:21,879
We need the bait alive.

277
00:34:23,275 --> 00:34:28,344
I mean, do you think for one
minute that they would pay us

278
00:34:29,148 --> 00:34:31,869
or let us live if it were any different.

279
00:34:34,345 --> 00:34:38,081
I'd will not allow anyone to jeopardize

280
00:34:38,945 --> 00:34:41,676
this operation or my reputation!

281
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,533
It won't happen again.
- No it won't!

282
00:34:50,376 --> 00:34:52,876
I want you to dispose of Ripple.

283
00:34:53,028 --> 00:34:55,907
Jesus Lamar, they were just fuckin cops.
- That's not the point!

284
00:34:57,884 --> 00:35:00,578
The point is he doesn't think.

285
00:35:04,146 --> 00:35:07,528
Ripple and I have been partners for years.
- I will not have an idiot fucking things up.

286
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,800
I do not want him to
return to this complex.

287
00:35:13,609 --> 00:35:17,248
You brought him in you take him out.

288
00:35:19,343 --> 00:35:22,274
You pick the time, you pick the place,

289
00:35:22,825 --> 00:35:25,532
and the only thing I suggest is you
do it quickly!

290
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:37,567
So Dorothy, how are all our friends in
California? - Well sir, got my early reports,

291
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:42,165
not very happy. Our biggest objections are
going to come from Douglas.

292
00:35:42,734 --> 00:35:46,837
That's where most of the cuts are going to
score direct hit, not that stock head

293
00:35:46,874 --> 00:35:50,857
and burros aregoing to roll over that easily.
They're all going to come at you

294
00:35:50,878 --> 00:35:54,875
with everything they have. - We’ll let them
bitch and moan all they want.

295
00:35:55,497 --> 00:36:00,899
It's their own fault, they can't fight facts.
It wouldn't have happened if they weren't

296
00:36:00,963 --> 00:36:05,506
so dam greedy in the first place. - Well, I
do believe that these four days

297
00:36:05,595 --> 00:36:08,864
are going to be the toughest of our
 campaign, but if we can convince

298
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:13,071
the people of California that we can make up
for the loss of employment in other areas,

299
00:36:13,135 --> 00:36:16,400
which we can. I think
the rest of the country

300
00:36:16,401 --> 00:36:19,311
will have no problem accepting our plan.

301
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:27,310
You're doing the right thing sir.
- I hope so!

302
00:36:52,891 --> 00:36:56,259
What do you think? - That's supposed to be a
getaway vehicle,

303
00:36:58,248 --> 00:37:00,748
I don't think anybody is gonna get away.

304
00:37:02,642 --> 00:37:05,142
What do you suggest?

305
00:37:06,616 --> 00:37:09,395
Whose vette is this?
- It's mine.

306
00:37:12,204 --> 00:37:16,421
Well I might need to borrow
a few parts, I’ll put them in here.

307
00:37:19,961 --> 00:37:23,940
Anything for the cause, right?
- Anything?

308
00:37:25,681 --> 00:37:28,181
It will be a lot less
painful if you don't watch.

309
00:37:36,607 --> 00:37:39,107
I got this straight off the internet.

310
00:37:40,236 --> 00:37:45,247
A blueprint of the bank, ain't nothing
sacred anymore? - This ain't nothing'.

311
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:49,236
I got an e-mail thing going' on with this
chick. - Look can we interrupt this fantasy

312
00:37:49,282 --> 00:37:54,081
just long enough to show us the vault?
- Sure. Right there.

313
00:37:55,303 --> 00:37:58,831
This corridor connects it with the lobby.
On the other side of this door,

314
00:37:59,957 --> 00:38:03,630
there's an employee entrance leading out to
chandler street. That's where Nicky will be.

315
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:07,366
Whole job shouldn't take more thank four
minutes and forty five seconds.

316
00:38:10,095 --> 00:38:14,089
Well then does everybody
know what to do?

317
00:38:15,954 --> 00:38:19,060
Then good luck, and remember,
nothing happens to Nick James.

318
00:38:31,263 --> 00:38:35,359
Not too bad Mr.Good Rench.
Not original, but not too bad.

319
00:38:36,756 --> 00:38:39,256
Don't you have anything
else to do besides bug me?

320
00:38:40,293 --> 00:38:42,793
I'd do your wife, but
she's takin' a nap.

321
00:38:44,997 --> 00:38:48,543
Don't get cocky Nicky boy.
Right now you're our meal ticket,

322
00:38:49,342 --> 00:38:53,267
but trust me, your days are
numbered. Thanksgiving's on it's way...

323
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:56,751
Get the fuck out of here!
- Turkey.

324
00:39:21,505 --> 00:39:24,005
Nadia?

325
00:40:04,857 --> 00:40:07,811
Come sit down! - I thought Nick
was gonna be here, where is he?

326
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,390
I think you better sit down.

327
00:40:15,654 --> 00:40:20,940
Now, he's right there.
- What do you mean right there?

328
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:28,812
See the van your husband's in
has a sensor in it, so from right here

329
00:40:30,131 --> 00:40:33,422
we can watch his whole little
adventure. Just like being there,

330
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:40,436
try it it's good.

331
00:40:59,643 --> 00:41:02,143
Hey, hey, hey, what, what are you
doing? What do you want?

332
00:41:02,204 --> 00:41:05,212
I'm just cleaning your window for a
dollar homs, it's awful dirty.

333
00:41:05,614 --> 00:41:10,353
I ain't gotta dollar now get the fuck out of
here! Hey hey ho,

334
00:41:11,786 --> 00:41:15,923
wipe off the rest of that would you? - For
somebody with no money you sure's hell picky.

335
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:22,245
Everything okay? - Absolutely officer
everything's fine.

336
00:41:23,205 --> 00:41:26,868
Is this guy bothering you? - No sir, he's
not, he's just, cleaning off the window.

337
00:41:28,268 --> 00:41:32,703
Well either keep it rolling' or put some
time in the meter! - Okay you got it.

338
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,910
Hey go away!

339
00:42:06,404 --> 00:42:09,132
Hold right there!
- Freeze!

340
00:42:39,731 --> 00:42:43,022
Go Nick go! - Drop a weapons
and get out of the vehicle!

341
00:42:47,355 --> 00:42:49,855
ARUSAAMATU TEKST.

342
00:42:55,886 --> 00:42:58,386
In pursuit of suspect,
heading east on Chandler street.

343
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:02,745
Hurry it up will ya?

344
00:43:07,726 --> 00:43:10,226
Now heading north on Olverado.

345
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:14,365
Why are the cops there? What's going on?
- Part of the plan.

346
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:18,460
What do you mean the
plan? - Well we want to see

347
00:43:18,504 --> 00:43:20,754
just how good of a driver
your husband really is.

348
00:43:28,888 --> 00:43:32,949
It ain't my fault! - It's all
your fault! - Fuck you! - Shut up!

349
00:43:43,062 --> 00:43:47,009
Why did you shoot that lady? - Because she
had a gun! - She didn't have nothing!

350
00:43:47,015 --> 00:43:49,515
Shut up. Both of you!
- Kill anyone, that wasn't part of the deal!

351
00:43:49,809 --> 00:43:52,309
They were just gonna hand us the money
and say thank you for shopping with us.

352
00:43:52,843 --> 00:43:56,179
Now do your job Mr.Stunt
man and lose assholes! - Shut up!

353
00:44:03,994 --> 00:44:06,494
Head him off at Beverly...

354
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:19,523
He's heading south on Redheart.

355
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,180
Continuing on redheart.

356
00:44:50,804 --> 00:44:53,304
Copy that we're closing in.

357
00:46:39,524 --> 00:46:42,024
What's happening?

00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:12,402
Hey Lacey, don't let

365
00:48:13,554 --> 00:48:16,054
Don't let anything happen to you!

366
00:48:21,158 --> 00:48:23,658
Come on, let's go!

367
00:48:29,244 --> 00:48:31,744

379
00:49:24,284 --> 00:49:27,400
Jack let him go! Jack let him go!

380
00:49:28,603 --> 00:49:32,044
Lieutenant - Hold on a second.
- Lieutenant, the bank robbery downtown,

381
00:49:32,646 --> 00:49:36,749
who do you think is driving the
getaway van? - Nick James? - You got it.

382
00:49:37,289 --> 00:49:39,789
All right, I’ll get back to you later. Bye.

383
00:49:40,957 --> 00:49:46,068
Lacey come one! It's me
Ripple, what? More money for us.

384
00:51:23,906 --> 00:51:26,221
Step out of the vehicle
you are surrounded.

385
00:51:26,222 --> 00:51:28,722
Step out of the vehicle
with your hands up!

386
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:24,880
All right, thanks.

387
00:52:27,488 --> 00:52:30,020
Well I checked with Simon,
the police don't have him.

388
00:52:30,167 --> 00:52:32,667
Well maybe he's using an alias, and
they don't know yet. Check again.

389
00:52:32,888 --> 00:52:37,367
Lamar, you're getting upset over nothing.
I mean, even if he is with the police

390
00:52:37,573 --> 00:52:40,256
he doesn't know nothing remember
about anything?

391
00:52:41,045 --> 00:52:43,995
If they ask him where
we are, he doesn't know.

392
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:49,371
Trust me, he'll call,

393
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:53,441
he won't jeopardize Nadia’s life.

394
00:52:53,442 --> 00:52:56,413
Where'd you leave Ripple?
- In the sewer.

395
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,260
That's a good place to leave Nick
James when this job is over.

396
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,381
I thought we were going to set him up? Then
turn him over to the cops when we were done?

397
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:12,771
Don't be ridiculous. When this jobs
done he's done. - And Nadia?

398
00:53:13,465 --> 00:53:15,792
What?
- And her?

399
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:19,607
You're beginning to sound
like Ripple. And her and her.

400
00:53:24,483 --> 00:53:28,202
Look look look look, I’d like to be
alone okay? - Sure boss.

401
00:53:43,561 --> 00:53:46,761
Where the hell you been? - Let's go!

402
00:54:14,478 --> 00:54:16,978
Lost your appetite?

403
00:54:21,203 --> 00:54:23,703
Didn't think you'd be that upset.

404
00:54:23,865 --> 00:54:27,336
Now why would you say something like that?
- Didn't think you cared about him anymore.

405
00:54:27,949 --> 00:54:30,457
Just because you don't care about somebody
doesn't mean you wish them dead,

406
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:34,636
maybe you don't know the difference.
- Luther just called his

407
00:54:34,708 --> 00:54:37,208
on his way in with Nick.

408
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,207
His not dead after
all, guess we can eat?
