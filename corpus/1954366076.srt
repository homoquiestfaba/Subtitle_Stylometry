1
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:08,786
As Baltimore's race
for mayor heats up,

2
00:01:08,826 --> 00:01:11,818
former Homicide lieutenant,
Al Giardello, is s cheduled

3
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,262
for a press conference
this morning,

4
00:01:13,298 --> 00:01:14,356
at the Inner Harbor.

5
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:16,833
He'll be joined by current mayor
Kurt Schmoke.

6
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:17,835
The joint appearance

7
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,030
signals an important
endors ement for Giardello.

8
00:01:21,072 --> 00:01:22,869
How does it feel
to be the favorite

9
00:01:22,907 --> 00:01:24,238
the last week
of the campaign?

10
00:01:24,275 --> 00:01:25,401
It ain't over
till it's over.

11
00:01:25,443 --> 00:01:27,411
The polls show you
12 points ahead

12
00:01:27,445 --> 00:01:28,742
of your opponent,
Robert Gessner.

13
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,179
The fat lady
has already taken

14
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,648
her curtain call,
don't you think?

15
00:01:31,683 --> 00:01:34,345
One thing I've learned working
with Homicide unit.

16
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,511
Never assume anything.

17
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:37,987
Give me a $1.00?
A $1.50?

18
00:01:38,022 --> 00:01:39,956
Just a measly $1.50!

19
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:43,693
Your recent statement,
that if elected,

20
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,662
you'd push
to legalize drugs.

21
00:01:45,697 --> 00:01:47,130
Do you think
this is the issue

22
00:01:47,165 --> 00:01:49,690
that has set your campaign
apart from your rival's?

23
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:53,734
I know what drugs have done
to this city.

24
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:56,001
Educate. Don't legislate.

25
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,064
That's all for now.

26
00:01:57,108 --> 00:01:58,769
Everybody,
take three steps back.

27
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,246
We want Al! We want Al!

28
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,147
We want Al!
We want Al!

29
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:17,189
We want Al!
We want Al!

30
00:04:03,935 --> 00:04:06,597
Meldrick, I will partner
with you any time,

31
00:04:06,637 --> 00:04:09,003
any place, when
it comes to a crime.

32
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,701
But I'm not investing
in your bar.

33
00:04:10,742 --> 00:04:12,733
Come on, Falsone,
you can s ee for yours elf

34
00:04:12,777 --> 00:04:15,075
that ''The Waterfront'' is
a moneymaking proposition, man.

35
00:04:15,113 --> 00:04:17,809
It's a cash cow.
Veritable green machine.

36
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:19,783
Yeah? So why you so anxious
to cut me a slice.

37
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:22,615
'Cause my other so called
partners are way too silent.

38
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:24,484
Munch is up in New York
looking for fame and glory.

39
00:04:24,522 --> 00:04:26,581
And Bayliss has taken
a semi-permanent

40
00:04:26,624 --> 00:04:27,613
leave of his senses.

41
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:29,592
So you need someone
to do all the work.

42
00:04:29,627 --> 00:04:31,254
Hey, all I'm asking,
Falsone,

43
00:04:31,295 --> 00:04:32,523
is just to give it
a couple of minutes

44
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,292
of your very, very
valuable time.

45
00:04:34,332 --> 00:04:35,822
Just examine
the concept.

46
00:04:35,867 --> 00:04:36,925
That's all
I'm saying.

47
00:04:36,968 --> 00:04:38,060
Yo, officer.

48
00:04:38,102 --> 00:04:38,591
Gentlemen.

49
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,634
Mike Giardello. As I live
and as I breathe.

50
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:44,197
I heard you traded the Bureau
for a beat.

51
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,436
Working on my detective
shield.

52
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:49,502
I love a man in uniform.
Check you out.

53
00:04:49,547 --> 00:04:52,107
Your pop's out there,
stumping for mayor,

54
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,708
and you're back here having
yourself a little yard sale.

55
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,048
Oh, it's been
a real media circus.

56
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,748
Every time I open the door
it's like candid camera.

57
00:04:57,789 --> 00:04:59,154
Hey.

58
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,455
Alan Funt was a great American,
okay, and I took his passing

59
00:05:02,493 --> 00:05:03,653
very, very personally.

60
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:04,888
So what we got here?

61
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,955
Local dealer. Shot in the head.
Been dead about a day.

62
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:09,557
Does our deadhead
have a name?

63
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,161
Jos eph Hardwick.
AKA Yin-Yang.

64
00:05:13,204 --> 00:05:14,296
Yin-Yang?

65
00:05:14,338 --> 00:05:16,772
Looks like he ''yinged''
when he should have ''yanged.''

66
00:05:16,808 --> 00:05:18,036
Hey, Mike.

67
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:18,973
Yeah?

68
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,808
Dispatch just radioed.
They you downtown pronto.

69
00:05:21,846 --> 00:05:22,505
What's up?

70
00:05:22,547 --> 00:05:23,878
Your father.

71
00:05:23,915 --> 00:05:24,779
He's been shot.

72
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,006
The question remains:

73
00:08:07,044 --> 00:08:09,342
Is it possible to find
a rule of thumb

74
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,938
to look outside the realm
of religion

75
00:08:10,982 --> 00:08:12,381
and its absolute values?

76
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:14,043
The answer is no.

77
00:08:14,085 --> 00:08:15,712
All people,
in the community,

78
00:08:15,753 --> 00:08:17,948
even those
without formal religion,

79
00:08:17,989 --> 00:08:20,219
formal absolute values,
formal spirituality...

80
00:08:23,494 --> 00:08:25,052
always construct
their own.

81
00:08:44,749 --> 00:08:46,011
Class dismissed.

82
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,649
Mayoral candidate
Al Giardello

83
00:08:51,689 --> 00:08:54,249
was making a campaign
appearance early this morning

84
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:57,283
when he was shot
by an unidentified assailant.

85
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,161
Giardello was rushed here
to Church Hillman hospital,

86
00:09:00,197 --> 00:09:04,031
where he is now undergoing
emergency surgery.

87
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:08,198
His condition is listed
as critical.

88
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:10,400
Here is his son,
Officer Michael Giardello,

89
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:12,306
perhaps we'll be able
to get a word with him.

90
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,207
Officer Giardello!

91
00:09:13,244 --> 00:09:14,506
I have nothing
to say.

92
00:09:14,545 --> 00:09:16,638
- Officer Giardello!
- Look, I don't know anything.

93
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,342
Well, tell me this,
how do you feel?

94
00:09:18,382 --> 00:09:19,610
How do you think I feel?
Get out of my face!

95
00:09:26,757 --> 00:09:28,691
Officer Giardello...

96
00:09:28,726 --> 00:09:31,524
understandably distraught about
this tragic turn of events.

97
00:09:36,267 --> 00:09:37,291
How's my father?

98
00:09:37,334 --> 00:09:39,063
He was shot
in the abdomen.

99
00:09:39,103 --> 00:09:39,933
Maybe more than once.

100
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,232
Is he gonna make it?

101
00:09:41,272 --> 00:09:42,364
He just went
into surgery.

102
00:09:42,406 --> 00:09:45,068
As soon as there's any news,
you'll be the first to know.

103
00:09:45,109 --> 00:09:47,134
- I promise you.
- Soon.

104
00:09:47,178 --> 00:09:48,110
No. No.

105
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,380
Maybe we should go
to the hospital.

106
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,388
Hey! G wouldn't want us
keeping vigil.

107
00:09:58,422 --> 00:09:59,719
He'd want us out there
in the black

108
00:09:59,757 --> 00:10:01,588
looking for the ebola
that did this.

109
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,092
What about
Joseph ''Yin-Yang'' Hardwick?

110
00:10:03,127 --> 00:10:03,855
Who?

111
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,759
Our day-old,
dead drug dealer.

112
00:10:05,796 --> 00:10:07,024
Aw, he'll keep.

113
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,465
Oh, look who's back
from oblivion.

114
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:12,833
Hey. You guys...
you find the shooter?

115
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,202
Naw. We were waiting
on you.

116
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:16,729
Oh, well,
I'm here to help.

117
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:19,437
Sabbatical's over?

118
00:10:19,477 --> 00:10:20,466
Yeah, for now.

119
00:10:20,511 --> 00:10:21,569
That's weird,
ain't it?

120
00:10:21,612 --> 00:10:22,704
What's that?

121
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,044
He just packs up
his desk,

122
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,242
doesn't say nothing to nobody,
just splits.

123
00:10:26,283 --> 00:10:28,251
I had things
to think about.

124
00:10:29,286 --> 00:10:30,446
Issues.

125
00:10:30,488 --> 00:10:31,614
That's the thing
about you Bayliss.

126
00:10:31,655 --> 00:10:32,849
See, you always
did have...

127
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:33,982
''issues.''

128
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:36,993
You gonna stand here
yapping?

129
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,625
Step back.
Step back.

130
00:10:41,665 --> 00:10:43,257
Any comment?

131
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,232
Any comment?

132
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:52,509
Frank.

133
00:11:04,588 --> 00:11:06,385
All right, some of you
came to homicide

134
00:11:06,423 --> 00:11:07,549
after Al Giardello left.

135
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:09,286
Some of you worked
alongside him.

136
00:11:09,326 --> 00:11:11,260
Like Kay Howard,
now on the Fugitive squad.

137
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,627
Tim Bayliss, been on a
leave of absence.

138
00:11:13,664 --> 00:11:15,791
Frank Pembleton,
retired a couple years ago.

139
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,357
You're the almighty, Pembleton.

140
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:18,595
We've all heard
the stories.

141
00:11:19,703 --> 00:11:20,601
Can we get on
with this?

142
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,606
Yep. Okay.

143
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,699
We got a homeless man,
won't give us his name,

144
00:11:24,742 --> 00:11:27,438
he grabbed Giardello
just before the shooting.

145
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,105
We swabbed his hands
for gunpowder residue.

146
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:29,976
He's clean.

147
00:11:30,014 --> 00:11:31,140
As soon as uniforms
bring him up,

148
00:11:31,182 --> 00:11:32,581
I'm gonna interview him,
find out what he saw.

149
00:11:32,616 --> 00:11:34,379
We talked to everybody
at the rally,

150
00:11:34,418 --> 00:11:36,682
and all thevendors,
and we brought in

151
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,347
a few witness es
for further questioning.

152
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:40,380
And this event was covered
by the press, right?

153
00:11:40,424 --> 00:11:41,516
We're way ahead
of you, Frank.

154
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:44,084
We've requested video footage
from the local news stations.

155
00:11:44,128 --> 00:11:46,926
Stivers and Ballard, I need you
to collect those cassettes.

156
00:11:46,964 --> 00:11:47,931
Sure, Lieutenant.

157
00:11:47,965 --> 00:11:50,160
Lots of witnesses,
what about suspects?

158
00:11:50,201 --> 00:11:52,863
G's campaign for mayor knocked
some noses out of joint.

159
00:11:52,903 --> 00:11:54,200
Made him a few enemies.

160
00:11:54,238 --> 00:11:55,865
Coupled with the ones
he already had.

161
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,937
I'm up.

162
00:11:58,976 --> 00:12:01,342
All right.
Howard, Bayliss.

163
00:12:01,378 --> 00:12:03,403
I want you researching
G's past.

164
00:12:03,447 --> 00:12:05,813
Get me everything on anybody
he ever tangled with.

165
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,817
How far back?

166
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,682
To his rookie days,
if you need to.

167
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:10,846
Pembleton, Lewis,
Falsone.

168
00:12:10,888 --> 00:12:11,786
Make me a list
of people

169
00:12:11,822 --> 00:12:14,552
that he's pissed off
on the campaign trail.

170
00:12:14,592 --> 00:12:16,116
A list?

171
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,991
Well, I didn't come here
to make lists.

172
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,895
Frank. Just like
old times.

173
00:12:20,931 --> 00:12:23,399
Okay, we meet back
in an hour.

174
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,568
Yeah, I love you too.

175
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:36,604
I caught a bullet
on a job myself, you know.

176
00:12:36,647 --> 00:12:37,773
Bullet in the brain.

177
00:12:38,816 --> 00:12:42,479
Stanley Bolander.
Used to work for your dad.

178
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:43,986
Thanks for coming.

179
00:12:44,021 --> 00:12:45,352
I had to, didn't I?

180
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,789
Your dad,
when I was shot...

181
00:12:47,825 --> 00:12:50,020
He was...
what's the word?

182
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:52,856
''Tenacious.''

183
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,194
Yeah, he is that.

184
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:57,758
Not like he sent me flowers
or anything like that, no.

185
00:12:57,801 --> 00:12:59,291
But he was
a pit bull.

186
00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:04,137
He wouldn't let go until they
caught the bastard who did it.

187
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:05,436
Mikey!

188
00:13:05,476 --> 00:13:06,238
Nonna!

189
00:13:06,277 --> 00:13:09,576
This is so terrible!
This is terrible!

190
00:13:09,613 --> 00:13:10,477
Come on.

191
00:13:10,514 --> 00:13:10,946
What's a new?

192
00:13:10,981 --> 00:13:12,676
There ain't nothing.
They tell me nothing.

193
00:13:18,489 --> 00:13:21,117
Hey, here's one of G's
from '82 that looks promising.

194
00:13:21,158 --> 00:13:22,785
Very blue.

195
00:13:23,994 --> 00:13:26,224
You never told me the squad
room was this blue.

196
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,252
Sure I did.

197
00:13:27,298 --> 00:13:28,492
Yeah, but not
this shade.

198
00:13:28,532 --> 00:13:29,396
No, huh?

199
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,923
This is excessively blue.

200
00:13:32,002 --> 00:13:32,730
Azure.

201
00:13:33,871 --> 00:13:35,065
Cobalt.

202
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,171
Cerulean.

203
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,334
Except the board.

204
00:13:39,376 --> 00:13:40,900
All these open cases.

205
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,038
Too much red.

206
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,742
Hurts my eyes.
I'm seeing spots.

207
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:46,511
What?

208
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:49,581
Nothing.

209
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,778
No, something.

210
00:13:51,822 --> 00:13:53,016
No.

211
00:13:53,057 --> 00:13:54,581
Well, what's this, Ryland.

212
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,593
Is this one
of your open-- Hmm.

213
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:57,719
No, no, no, no.

214
00:13:57,761 --> 00:14:00,059
That stone cold sucker
is mine, Frank.

215
00:14:00,097 --> 00:14:03,294
Luke Ryland snuffed two women
live on the Internet.

216
00:14:08,572 --> 00:14:12,770
And Baltimore being Balto-less,
he got off on a technicality.

217
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,335
Next day they found him,
curbside, laying there.

218
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:17,006
.44 slug in the back
of his head.

219
00:14:19,783 --> 00:14:21,341
- You got a suspect?
- Not anyone.

220
00:14:21,385 --> 00:14:24,183
Nuh-uh.
Whoever did the deed,

221
00:14:24,221 --> 00:14:26,189
knew how to execute
an execution.

222
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:32,762
And this, sordid little tale
makes you jumpy, because--

223
00:14:32,796 --> 00:14:34,195
No, no, Frank.

224
00:14:34,231 --> 00:14:36,392
Doesn't make me jumpy.

225
00:14:36,433 --> 00:14:38,264
Oh, come on.
You're jumpy. I know you.

226
00:14:38,302 --> 00:14:40,862
No. You know something,
you don't know me.

227
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:44,007
Things change, Frank.

228
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,736
People...

229
00:14:45,776 --> 00:14:46,970
they change.

230
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:57,149
Kid's still in the interview room
with the homeless guy, huh?

231
00:14:59,156 --> 00:15:00,145
Yeah, I guess.

232
00:15:01,825 --> 00:15:03,656
Taking way
too much time.

233
00:15:06,797 --> 00:15:07,593
Yeah.

234
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,838
You got a name.
I know you do.

235
00:15:19,943 --> 00:15:21,103
Give me a dollar.

236
00:15:21,145 --> 00:15:23,773
You know, I got
a hundred eyeballs

237
00:15:23,814 --> 00:15:25,577
saw you assault
Al Giardello.

238
00:15:25,616 --> 00:15:28,380
Now you saw who shot him,
didn't you?

239
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:28,976
Didn't you?

240
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:31,510
I want a dollar. I gotta get
something to eat.

241
00:15:31,989 --> 00:15:33,115
Come on!

242
00:15:33,157 --> 00:15:35,955
Just a, measly little dollar?
That so much to ask?

243
00:15:35,993 --> 00:15:36,584
You know what?

244
00:15:36,627 --> 00:15:39,152
I am really losing
my patience with you.

245
00:15:39,196 --> 00:15:41,357
You know, I was gonna give you
a number two beating.

246
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,025
But you have worked
and worked.

247
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,092
And you have earned yourself
a number one.

248
00:15:45,135 --> 00:15:46,500
Now I am gonna beat
your balls

249
00:15:46,537 --> 00:15:48,505
until you tell me
what I wanna know.

250
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:50,871
This does not reflect
my command.

251
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,843
I thought you were in charge
here, Lt. Gharty.

252
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,073
You better go help
your man.

253
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:05,513
Damn!

254
00:16:12,496 --> 00:16:14,225
This is gonna cost you,
buddy.

255
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,061
This is gonna cost you.

256
00:16:17,668 --> 00:16:18,498
You okay, mister?

257
00:16:18,535 --> 00:16:20,867
See him come at me? Huh?
See how he came at me?

258
00:16:20,904 --> 00:16:21,700
Whoa!

259
00:16:21,738 --> 00:16:22,762
Shit!

260
00:16:24,408 --> 00:16:25,932
All right, sit down.

261
00:16:25,976 --> 00:16:27,807
- Sit down. Sit down.
- Why, you big --

262
00:16:27,845 --> 00:16:29,107
Come on, sit down.

263
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:33,880
What are you two
doing in here?

264
00:16:38,088 --> 00:16:38,884
What's this?

265
00:16:38,922 --> 00:16:39,286
Hey, hey, hey,

266
00:16:39,323 --> 00:16:40,119
I'm in the middle
of something here.

267
00:16:40,157 --> 00:16:41,454
A dollar.

268
00:16:41,492 --> 00:16:42,925
You asked
for a dollar?

269
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,154
Yeah, I asked
for a dollar.

270
00:16:44,194 --> 00:16:45,627
I heard you.

271
00:16:45,662 --> 00:16:47,687
I know you guys
are legends, but, uh...

272
00:16:47,731 --> 00:16:49,198
This is
my interview.

273
00:16:49,233 --> 00:16:49,597
Shut up.

274
00:16:51,001 --> 00:16:52,127
What?

275
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:52,965
Excuse me?

276
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,804
I said:

277
00:16:57,841 --> 00:16:59,672
Shut the hell up.

278
00:17:02,613 --> 00:17:03,773
Me out?

279
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:06,112
Yeah, grab a coffee.

280
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,276
This ain't right.

281
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,478
Grab me one, too.
Milk, two sugars.

282
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:17,660
Well, he's a feisty little guy,
isn't he?

283
00:17:17,694 --> 00:17:19,594
I'll be right in there
if you need me.

284
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,662
Tell me
what's going on!

285
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,687
I'm really sorry,
sir, but

286
00:17:54,731 --> 00:17:56,221
I don't know
what's going on.

287
00:17:56,266 --> 00:17:58,097
Well, then find me someone
who does!

288
00:17:58,135 --> 00:17:59,534
Hey, Mike, Mike.

289
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,594
It's been hours.

290
00:18:00,637 --> 00:18:02,969
I can't get any real information
from anybody.

291
00:18:03,006 --> 00:18:04,598
The hospital has got
to cover its ass

292
00:18:04,641 --> 00:18:05,972
just like everybody else.

293
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:07,237
And you want to know
something else?

294
00:18:07,277 --> 00:18:08,574
The minute that he's out
of surgery,

295
00:18:08,612 --> 00:18:11,240
I'm sure they'll be telling you
exactly what they did

296
00:18:11,281 --> 00:18:13,249
and handing you
an itemized bill.

297
00:18:13,283 --> 00:18:14,614
Yeah.

298
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,554
Oh, look, they're replaying
that little clip

299
00:18:20,591 --> 00:18:23,992
of you pushing Helen Lucaitis
ass over tea kettle.

300
00:18:24,027 --> 00:18:24,652
Great.

301
00:18:27,664 --> 00:18:29,222
You made
the national news.

302
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:33,861
Al would be proud.

303
00:18:35,706 --> 00:18:38,834
You know, I can't believe you
were my father's boss.

304
00:18:39,943 --> 00:18:40,807
For awhile.

305
00:18:41,845 --> 00:18:47,249
But, I was also his equal.
And his underling.

306
00:18:47,284 --> 00:18:50,048
Guess you might say I know
all sides of the man.

307
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,424
Yeah, wish I did.

308
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,218
I used to be FBI Liaison
with the department.

309
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,232
Took the job to be closer
to him.

310
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,166
Make amends.

311
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:06,669
Maybe put to rest some anger
and resentment

312
00:19:06,703 --> 00:19:07,897
we have
for each other.

313
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,701
But that didn't happen?

314
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,675
If anything, working together
made things worse.

315
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:13,505
You pimped us.

316
00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:14,441
Oh, man.

317
00:19:14,478 --> 00:19:15,604
He gave everything
you told him

318
00:19:15,646 --> 00:19:17,113
to the Independent Counsel's
office.

319
00:19:17,147 --> 00:19:18,079
Well, how was I
to know?

320
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:22,017
We were always stepping
on each other's toes.

321
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,613
So, I quit.

322
00:19:25,656 --> 00:19:28,489
Started over
as a Balto uniform.

323
00:19:28,525 --> 00:19:30,220
Bottom of the totem pole.

324
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:34,720
I don't know if any of it
made any difference to my dad.

325
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:37,762
If he even noticed.

326
00:19:52,015 --> 00:19:53,573
You wouldn't hurt
anybody.

327
00:19:53,617 --> 00:19:55,346
Would you?

328
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:56,975
No.

329
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,988
You wouldn't hurt anybody
because it's not in you?

330
00:20:00,123 --> 00:20:02,353
Al Giardello wouldn't hurt
anybody either.

331
00:20:02,392 --> 00:20:04,155
It's not in him.

332
00:20:04,194 --> 00:20:06,958
You and he, you got
a lot in common.

333
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,965
That's why I asked him
for a dollar.

334
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,967
I knew he'd understand.

335
00:20:11,902 --> 00:20:14,632
What's your...
your name?

336
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:18,269
You ain't got an address,
what do you need a name for?

337
00:20:18,308 --> 00:20:20,208
Post office
can't find me.

338
00:20:20,243 --> 00:20:21,540
Why should it matter
if I have a name.

339
00:20:21,578 --> 00:20:23,170
Well, we don't need
to know your name.

340
00:20:23,213 --> 00:20:26,910
What we need to know is if you
saw who hurt Al Giardello?

341
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,645
You got a dollar?

342
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,016
A dollar?

343
00:20:30,053 --> 00:20:31,850
I'm jonesin'
for a Hershey bar.

344
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:33,583
I just gave you
a dollar.

345
00:20:33,623 --> 00:20:35,318
I'm asking him.

346
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,725
What did you see
at the Inner Harbor today?

347
00:20:37,761 --> 00:20:39,991
I'm a fiend
for chocolate.

348
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,964
Didn't I just give you
a dollar?

349
00:20:41,998 --> 00:20:44,023
Didn't I?

350
00:20:44,067 --> 00:20:44,795
Yeah.

351
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,094
So now you gonna play me
for the fool?

352
00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:51,937
If I give you a dollar, will you
tell us what you saw today?

353
00:20:51,975 --> 00:20:53,499
I'm the fool,
right?

354
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:57,138
I gave you a dollar,
and now, what, huh?

355
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,841
No, no, no, no.

356
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,110
Put that away.

357
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,345
I'm here out of concern
for a good person.

358
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,876
Somebody who means
a lot to me.

359
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,751
Means a lot
to this city.

360
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:07,950
And what, now you think
this is some kind of deal

361
00:21:07,991 --> 00:21:11,358
where you gonna...
use my concern to mooch money?

362
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,523
'Cause... you think
that you're the key to the puzzle?

363
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:18,159
You're holding all the vital info,
so yeah, screw me.

364
00:21:18,201 --> 00:21:20,169
And screw him!

365
00:21:20,203 --> 00:21:21,830
And screw Al Giardello.

366
00:21:23,273 --> 00:21:24,240
Hmm?

367
00:21:31,014 --> 00:21:33,642
Do you think
you mean anything?

368
00:21:35,652 --> 00:21:36,914
To anybody?

369
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,912
Anything to this city?

370
00:21:39,956 --> 00:21:40,854
No.

371
00:21:40,891 --> 00:21:41,516
But I'm here.

372
00:21:41,558 --> 00:21:43,321
I'm extending you
my kindness.

373
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,453
I give you what you want,
out of goodwill.

374
00:21:45,495 --> 00:21:47,554
And it's not about the money.
It's not about a dollar.

375
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,497
'Cause if you ask me for ten,
I'll give you ten.

376
00:21:49,533 --> 00:21:50,465
Ask for a hundred,
you got it!

377
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,024
I'm respecting you.

378
00:21:52,068 --> 00:21:53,933
But you're gonna
sit there...

379
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:56,871
and piss on me.

380
00:21:59,376 --> 00:22:01,936
I'm gonna send you
to hell, mister.

381
00:22:01,978 --> 00:22:06,381
''I ain't got a name,'' so feel
sorry for my mooching ass.

382
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:09,317
I'm jonesin' for a Hershey bar.

383
00:22:09,352 --> 00:22:11,980
The guy that I see
is in his late 40s--

384
00:22:12,022 --> 00:22:13,489
or early 50s, maybe.

385
00:22:13,523 --> 00:22:16,856
- Jonesin' for that Hershey bar!
- Of the Negro persuasion.

386
00:22:19,729 --> 00:22:21,253
The guy is black.

387
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:26,197
Uh-huh, what's he look like?
How tall is he?

388
00:22:26,236 --> 00:22:29,433
He is...
nearly as tall as me.

389
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,737
Got gray sidewalls.

390
00:22:33,777 --> 00:22:36,177
His hair, you know.
Sideburns.

391
00:22:36,213 --> 00:22:37,805
And he's got a gun.

392
00:22:37,848 --> 00:22:39,839
One of them black guns,
that go pop-pop-pop.

393
00:22:39,883 --> 00:22:40,577
An automatic.

394
00:22:40,617 --> 00:22:41,879
I don't know.

395
00:22:41,918 --> 00:22:45,319
Okay, so he shoots
this gun, pop-pop-pop.

396
00:22:45,355 --> 00:22:47,118
What happens then?
Where does he go?

397
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,717
He just disappears. He gets
swallowed up in the crowd.

398
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:50,487
I got scared.

399
00:22:50,527 --> 00:22:51,494
I was just trying
to get out of there.

400
00:22:51,528 --> 00:22:53,928
And then the cops
grabbed me up.

401
00:22:53,964 --> 00:22:54,931
Oh.

402
00:22:56,533 --> 00:22:58,057
Can I have
that other dollar now?

403
00:23:00,036 --> 00:23:02,402
Giardello is still
in surgery at this hour.

404
00:23:02,439 --> 00:23:04,964
Meanwhile, police have
intensified their investigation,

405
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:07,476
interviewing literally hundreds
of witnesses.

406
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,944
We'll have more
after this.

407
00:23:08,979 --> 00:23:09,707
And we're out.

408
00:23:09,746 --> 00:23:12,112
I'd like to give you
the tape, but I can't.

409
00:23:12,148 --> 00:23:13,877
Okay, well then
we'll get a subpoena.

410
00:23:13,917 --> 00:23:15,612
No, you don't understand,
I can't.

411
00:23:15,652 --> 00:23:17,552
There was some kind
of technical glitch

412
00:23:17,587 --> 00:23:18,952
- with our camera.
- Glitch?

413
00:23:18,989 --> 00:23:21,514
All I got is stuff leading up
to the gunshots,

414
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:22,957
then the camera dies.

415
00:23:22,993 --> 00:23:24,688
We're the only station
in town

416
00:23:24,728 --> 00:23:26,355
that didn't have footage
of the actual shooting.

417
00:23:26,396 --> 00:23:27,829
And believe me,
I'm not happy,

418
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,162
losing out on the biggest
news story of the year.

419
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,065
I'm crying
big crocodile tears.

420
00:23:32,102 --> 00:23:34,070
Give us what you've got.

421
00:23:34,104 --> 00:23:35,696
Okay, we're back
in 10.

422
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,605
So you're living
in St. Michael's now, huh?

423
00:23:38,642 --> 00:23:40,473
Yeah.
Play a little golf.

424
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,875
Practice the cello.

425
00:23:41,912 --> 00:23:44,813
Hey, retirement agrees with you.
You got that healthy pink glow.

426
00:23:44,848 --> 00:23:46,645
That's high blood
pressure.

427
00:23:46,683 --> 00:23:50,619
I'm on a zero sodium diet.
Zero as in none.

428
00:23:50,654 --> 00:23:52,815
As in I can't even go down
to the ocean.

429
00:23:52,856 --> 00:23:55,188
Take in the sea breeze.

430
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,887
You know how bland life is
without salt?

431
00:23:57,928 --> 00:24:00,192
I was under the impression
that you were still in Balto.

432
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:00,821
No.

433
00:24:00,864 --> 00:24:02,126
That you refuse
to answer my calls

434
00:24:02,165 --> 00:24:03,462
out of some
misdirected spite.

435
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,968
I have never
mis-whatevered my spite.

436
00:24:06,002 --> 00:24:07,594
I got married again.

437
00:24:07,637 --> 00:24:09,036
What, number four?

438
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,199
Yeah. In two weeks,
I'm getting divorced.

439
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,869
Jeez, John!

440
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,537
I like this.
This is great.

441
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,570
You and I, we're prowling
the streets of Baltimore again.

442
00:24:17,614 --> 00:24:20,048
I have never prowled the streets
of anywhere with you, all right?

443
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,914
Don't start agitating
me much.

444
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:25,317
- Come on...
- What's the status...

445
00:24:25,355 --> 00:24:26,845
Step back,
step back.

446
00:24:31,828 --> 00:24:33,056
Stop it there.

447
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,591
What are you
looking at, Stan?

448
00:24:38,635 --> 00:24:40,762
Uh, well, you see this guy
right here?

449
00:24:40,804 --> 00:24:43,136
He's right on the edge
of the stage.

450
00:24:43,173 --> 00:24:44,800
His body language.

451
00:24:44,841 --> 00:24:46,570
Doesn't look right.

452
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,975
I can't see anything.

453
00:24:48,011 --> 00:24:49,979
We're looking
for a gun.

454
00:24:50,013 --> 00:24:52,311
At this angle, you can't even
see his hands.

455
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:54,249
Well, what we need
is to enhance the tape.

456
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,684
Yeah, send a copy
to the state police lab.

457
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,414
Lieutenant!
We--

458
00:24:58,588 --> 00:24:59,885
Captain.

459
00:24:59,923 --> 00:25:02,255
My, my, my,
look at this.

460
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:06,752
Sgt. Howard, Frank Pembleton,
Munch, Bayliss.

461
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,525
Even the big man.

462
00:25:08,565 --> 00:25:11,432
All the old boys and girls
gathered again.

463
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,060
Everybody
pals y-walsy.

464
00:25:13,103 --> 00:25:14,661
You interrupt one
of my detectives

465
00:25:14,704 --> 00:25:17,468
in the course of interviewing
a witness?

466
00:25:17,507 --> 00:25:19,099
I was giving him
some relief.

467
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:20,700
Relief, my ass.

468
00:25:20,744 --> 00:25:23,144
You just wanted to show him
who's boss, that's your game.

469
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:23,543
Sir--

470
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,741
But now I'm gonna show you
who's boss.

471
00:25:25,782 --> 00:25:28,410
I order you to apologize
to Detective Hall.

472
00:25:28,451 --> 00:25:30,214
Apologize?

473
00:25:30,253 --> 00:25:30,742
Bobby.

474
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:36,223
Go ahead.

475
00:25:40,463 --> 00:25:42,397
I... apologize.

476
00:25:42,432 --> 00:25:43,490
Yeah, no problem.

477
00:25:46,903 --> 00:25:49,201
Now what the hell are
all of you doing in here?

478
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:50,433
We came to help.

479
00:25:51,808 --> 00:25:53,139
This is your call?

480
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,040
What are you,
desperate?

481
00:25:54,077 --> 00:25:56,545
No, for G we come
on our own.

482
00:25:56,579 --> 00:25:57,876
Truly noble.

483
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,275
Get your ass in gear,
Gharty.

484
00:26:01,317 --> 00:26:03,251
I want this Giardello shooting
down today.

485
00:26:03,286 --> 00:26:05,220
That's what we all want,
Gaffney.

486
00:26:06,222 --> 00:26:08,452
This is police business.

487
00:26:08,491 --> 00:26:10,982
You're not a cop anymore,
is that right, Frank?

488
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,358
That's correct.

489
00:26:12,395 --> 00:26:14,556
Then get lost.

490
00:26:14,597 --> 00:26:16,792
Okay. Sure.
Fine.

491
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:18,130
Me too, then.

492
00:26:18,168 --> 00:26:20,898
No, no, Bolander.
You can stay.

493
00:26:20,937 --> 00:26:24,100
That's the beauty of power.
It's arbitrary.

494
00:26:26,643 --> 00:26:29,077
I have a press conference
at 2:00.

495
00:26:29,112 --> 00:26:32,240
I better have some startling new
revelations to tell the media.

496
00:26:34,751 --> 00:26:37,117
Somebody open
a window.

497
00:26:37,153 --> 00:26:39,417
That won't do any good,
that's ''Eau de Gaffney.''

498
00:26:39,456 --> 00:26:41,048
Lingers for days.

499
00:26:41,091 --> 00:26:43,059
- Frank?
- Uh, don't worry about it.

500
00:26:43,093 --> 00:26:45,084
If we... if we get anywhere,
I'll keep you posted.

501
00:26:45,128 --> 00:26:46,356
Fine, fine.
Give me a ring.

502
00:26:47,931 --> 00:26:48,955
Frank!
Wait, wait, wait.

503
00:26:48,998 --> 00:26:50,022
You're just
gonna leave?

504
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,000
Yes. And you're coming
with me.

505
00:26:52,035 --> 00:26:52,729
Where?

506
00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:54,566
If the bosses won't let us
investigate,

507
00:26:54,604 --> 00:26:56,265
we'll do our own.

508
00:26:56,306 --> 00:26:58,638
- Unofficially.
- A citizen's brigade.

509
00:26:58,675 --> 00:27:00,108
Okay, let's start
with the crime scene.

510
00:27:00,143 --> 00:27:01,576
Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me.

511
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,849
We got 15 different descriptions
of a possible shooter

512
00:27:06,883 --> 00:27:08,373
from 25 different
witnesses.

513
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,215
Some say he's black,
some say white.

514
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:13,188
Some say he's in his 20s,
others in his 60s.

515
00:27:13,223 --> 00:27:15,487
Yeah, well, they all agree that
the shooter is a man, right?

516
00:27:15,525 --> 00:27:17,720
Well, actually, a few of them
think that maybe he's a woman.

517
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,092
Yeah, I say it's
a conspiracy.

518
00:27:19,129 --> 00:27:20,096
Oh, Munch.

519
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,098
This guy that G's running against,
what's his name, Gessner.

520
00:27:22,132 --> 00:27:23,759
He sees that he's going
to get his ass kicked.

521
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,199
So he decides
to take action.

522
00:27:25,235 --> 00:27:27,465
So he hires an assassin, like in
the ''Manchurian Candidate.''

523
00:27:27,504 --> 00:27:29,631
What did I say
about agitating, Munch?

524
00:27:29,672 --> 00:27:32,140
I'm gonna check out the widow
of Raymond Desassy.

525
00:27:32,175 --> 00:27:33,301
What, the guy G shot?

526
00:27:33,343 --> 00:27:34,742
G shot someone?

527
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:35,972
Yeah, a couple,
three years ago.

528
00:27:36,012 --> 00:27:38,344
Kevin Lugo,
big shock radio personality.

529
00:27:38,381 --> 00:27:40,849
I remember, he got whacked
in the Mt. Washington parking lot.

530
00:27:40,884 --> 00:27:43,546
Yeah, we get a tip Raymond
Desassy is the murderer,

531
00:27:43,586 --> 00:27:45,747
Gand I go to his house,
Desassy draws a weapon,

532
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:46,881
G shoots him dead.

533
00:27:51,828 --> 00:27:55,264
Turns out our tip was from
Raymond Desassy's best friend.

534
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:57,459
Called it in
as a practical joke.

535
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,492
Desassy's wife was pretty bitter
about the whole thing.

536
00:28:00,537 --> 00:28:03,131
Okay, Howard.
Mrs. Desassy it is.

537
00:28:03,173 --> 00:28:04,265
Hey, you need backup?

538
00:28:04,674 --> 00:28:06,073
Sure.

539
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:09,236
Stivers, Ballard,
take the video tapes

540
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,042
to the state lab
and study every frame.

541
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,412
Lewis, stop by the courthouse,
grab Sheppard,

542
00:28:13,449 --> 00:28:15,610
and go talk
to Carl Miller.

543
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,710
Carl Miller?

544
00:28:17,754 --> 00:28:19,415
The pride
of the Aryan Nation.

545
00:28:19,455 --> 00:28:20,547
Yeah, he's been beating
the drums,

546
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:23,320
trying to start a race war
over G's drug policy.

547
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:25,691
If you're volunteering,
how about calling on John Komen?

548
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,025
Whatever you need,
Lieutenant.

549
00:28:27,063 --> 00:28:28,428
Who's John Komen?

550
00:28:28,464 --> 00:28:30,955
Uh, there was a mass suicide
of the African Revival Movement.

551
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,433
Yeah, I saw it
on the news.

552
00:28:32,468 --> 00:28:35,562
Yeah, QRT storms the place,
finds 16 bodies. Poisoned.

553
00:28:35,605 --> 00:28:37,266
A real Jonestown.
Not like the other one,

554
00:28:37,307 --> 00:28:39,707
where the CIA and the military
whacked those people.

555
00:28:39,742 --> 00:28:42,438
Komen's taken over as the head
honcho of the movement.

556
00:28:42,478 --> 00:28:44,309
So, we talk to him.

557
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,315
You know, I say
a Black Nationalist

558
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,782
and two whiter shades
of pale detectives

559
00:28:47,817 --> 00:28:49,876
don't exactly interface,
you catch my drift?

560
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,716
You know, if you got
a problem with it, Munch,

561
00:28:51,754 --> 00:28:53,085
make it easy on yourself.

562
00:28:53,122 --> 00:28:55,454
There's an Amtrak back
to the Big Apple every hour.

563
00:28:55,491 --> 00:28:58,221
Stan, you know where the African
Revival Movement building is?

564
00:28:58,261 --> 00:29:01,025
If it's in Balto,
I can find it.

565
00:29:01,064 --> 00:29:02,861
What do you want me
to do, L.T.?

566
00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:04,764
Check the 800 Tip line.

567
00:29:04,801 --> 00:29:07,167
Okay, we got 48 hours
to catch this guy.

568
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:10,172
Anything longer than that,
and you know what hits the fan.

569
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,571
All right?
We're a team.

570
00:29:11,608 --> 00:29:13,940
Let's go.
Let's catch this bastard.

571
00:29:13,977 --> 00:29:15,808
Could have handled
this better, Stuey.

572
00:29:15,845 --> 00:29:17,836
Are you coming,
Detective Munch?

573
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,280
Yeah, yeah,
but I'm driving.

574
00:29:19,315 --> 00:29:20,282
You know I like to drive,

575
00:29:20,316 --> 00:29:22,045
as long as you don't smoke
with the windows closed.

576
00:29:22,085 --> 00:29:24,076
- We're gonna smoke.
- What you know--

577
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,021
- I've got a cigar this big.
- Oh, man. Here we go again.

578
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,217
Mrs. Giardello, any word
on his condition?

579
00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:30,749
- Uh, excuse me, do you mind?
- No, no.

580
00:29:30,793 --> 00:29:32,522
Hey!

581
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:33,995
Hey, you! Leave her alone!

582
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,156
Leave her alone!

583
00:29:35,198 --> 00:29:36,927
What are you doing
here, anyway?

584
00:29:37,867 --> 00:29:39,198
Leave her the hell alone!

585
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:40,759
We're just doing
our job, okay?

586
00:29:40,803 --> 00:29:41,963
That's no excuse.

587
00:29:45,675 --> 00:29:49,236
Pressure's 90 over 60.
Heart rate's up to 120.

588
00:29:53,616 --> 00:29:55,550
That's the second one.

589
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,519
Big sucker.

590
00:29:57,553 --> 00:29:59,680
Let me see
the X-ray.

591
00:30:00,723 --> 00:30:02,486
Suction, please.

592
00:30:05,161 --> 00:30:07,652
Hmm, we need to clean up
these rib slivers.

593
00:30:07,697 --> 00:30:09,221
So, how was that
for you, Frank?

594
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:10,664
Being back
in that squad room?

595
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,327
Strange.

596
00:30:12,368 --> 00:30:14,768
So many things
have changed.

597
00:30:14,804 --> 00:30:17,238
Well, the color of the doors
and the floors, maybe.

598
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:20,640
But, the room's the same,
the work's the same.

599
00:30:20,677 --> 00:30:23,646
Yeah. Yeah, I guess
that will never be different.

600
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,945
What bothered me the most was
not seeing G there, you know?

601
00:30:26,983 --> 00:30:29,850
Having him charging out of his
office like a water buffalo.

602
00:30:29,886 --> 00:30:31,683
As a matter of fact,
the last conversation

603
00:30:31,721 --> 00:30:34,087
we ever had
was over your hospital bed.

604
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,886
After you took
the bullet for me.

605
00:30:41,164 --> 00:30:42,461
My partner's down!

606
00:30:42,498 --> 00:30:44,466
My partner's been shot!

607
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,626
Somebody!

608
00:30:45,668 --> 00:30:47,101
But really it wasn't him
I was angry at.

609
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,161
It was the whole,
you know...

610
00:30:49,205 --> 00:30:50,900
bloody business.

611
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,736
Yeah.

612
00:30:53,209 --> 00:30:55,302
I haven't spoken to him
since that day.

613
00:30:56,346 --> 00:30:57,335
And now,
here it is,

614
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,075
I may never get the chance
to speak to him again.

615
00:30:59,115 --> 00:31:01,982
Well, Frank, why don't we just
stop by the hospital now, huh?

616
00:31:03,586 --> 00:31:04,985
He's in surgery.

617
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,456
Besides, I can do more
for the man...

618
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,548
out here
on the street.

619
00:31:08,591 --> 00:31:10,286
He didn't hate you,
Frank.

620
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,089
And he knows you didn't
hate him.

621
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,686
But I handed him
my badge.

622
00:31:15,398 --> 00:31:17,025
He hated that.

623
00:31:21,537 --> 00:31:24,870
You're not upset by the shooting
of Al Giardello?

624
00:31:24,907 --> 00:31:26,169
Upset? Yes.

625
00:31:26,209 --> 00:31:27,335
But not surprised.

626
00:31:27,377 --> 00:31:29,038
There's a long tradition
in this country

627
00:31:29,078 --> 00:31:31,046
of shooting black men
who speak the truth.

628
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,073
We got a witness who says that
the would-be assassin was black.

629
00:31:35,118 --> 00:31:36,642
A black assassin?

630
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,210
How convenient.

631
00:31:38,254 --> 00:31:39,721
The white man
can always find

632
00:31:39,756 --> 00:31:42,088
a race traitor
to do his dirty work.

633
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:43,888
There are those who blame
Al Giardello for what happened

634
00:31:43,926 --> 00:31:45,416
in this building
three years ago.

635
00:31:45,461 --> 00:31:46,826
There's some say
he's responsible

636
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,228
for those 16 suicides.

637
00:31:58,107 --> 00:31:59,540
Do you think
I would want revenge?

638
00:31:59,575 --> 00:32:01,008
Well, maybe some
of your followers--

639
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,909
Which you see where?

640
00:32:02,945 --> 00:32:05,539
This movement was destroyed
that day.

641
00:32:05,581 --> 00:32:07,242
So this morning,
at about 8:15--

642
00:32:07,283 --> 00:32:08,215
Was I at the Inner Harbor?

643
00:32:08,584 --> 00:32:09,346
No.

644
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,410
Anybody who can vouch
for your whereabouts?

645
00:32:11,454 --> 00:32:12,386
I was here.

646
00:32:12,422 --> 00:32:14,049
Okay, what about somebody
to back you up, then--

647
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:14,886
Yes.

648
00:32:14,924 --> 00:32:17,916
They'll tell you that I was
at my desk. Working.

649
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,358
Working?

650
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,520
Said you had
no following.

651
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:22,053
I'm going to be interviewed
this week on the radio.

652
00:32:22,098 --> 00:32:23,588
''The Mark Steiner Show.''

653
00:32:23,633 --> 00:32:25,225
Steiner? I like him.

654
00:32:25,268 --> 00:32:28,465
And I'm going to tell the world
that Al Giardello

655
00:32:28,504 --> 00:32:31,530
was set up by the white banking
establishment to run for mayor.

656
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:32,472
Then shot by them.

657
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:35,272
The bank shot Giardello?

658
00:32:35,311 --> 00:32:38,838
Giardello gets popular,
he gets shot, he dies.

659
00:32:38,881 --> 00:32:41,850
The city riots.
The city goes up in flames.

660
00:32:41,884 --> 00:32:43,010
The smokes clears.

661
00:32:43,052 --> 00:32:45,384
The banks come in and rebuild
the neighborhoods.

662
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:48,185
Shoving all the poor blacks
out to the collar counties.

663
00:32:48,224 --> 00:32:51,216
The banks and the developers
want all that land near the harbor.

664
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,353
It's worth hundreds
of millions.

665
00:32:53,396 --> 00:32:55,023
The banks, huh?

666
00:32:55,064 --> 00:32:57,362
If you think about it, the scary
part is, it makes sense.

667
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,063
The banks, the multinationals,
the real estate lobby.

668
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,470
That's big money,
Stan.

669
00:33:03,506 --> 00:33:04,700
Think about it.

670
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,901
When you gonna let me
re-open my cart?

671
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,639
I mean, I'm dying here,
I'm losing a whole day's receipts.

672
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,943
I told you and them other
detectives 99 times already

673
00:33:11,981 --> 00:33:12,743
I didn't nothing.

674
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,716
And I told you a hundred times
you are lying.

675
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,614
Why would I lie?

676
00:33:15,651 --> 00:33:16,379
Because you're afraid.

677
00:33:16,419 --> 00:33:17,943
Me? No I'm not afraid
of nobody.

678
00:33:17,987 --> 00:33:19,011
Yeah you are,
you're frightened.

679
00:33:19,055 --> 00:33:20,784
You're frightened of the guy
who shot Al Giardello.

680
00:33:20,823 --> 00:33:22,586
You're afraid that if he finds
out you I D'd him,

681
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:23,614
he'll come back,
shoot you too.

682
00:33:23,659 --> 00:33:25,752
Listen, if you know anything,
you should tell us.

683
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:26,659
We'll protect you.

684
00:33:26,696 --> 00:33:27,788
Yeah, how?

685
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,957
Look, this thing goes to trial,
I've got to testify.

686
00:33:29,999 --> 00:33:31,626
The gunman gets off,
I'm dead.

687
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:32,759
No thanks.

688
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,168
Look, I got no reason to die
for this goon Giardello.

689
00:33:35,204 --> 00:33:35,932
Goon?

690
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:36,939
Well, legalizing drugs?

691
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:37,962
Come on,
that's insane!

692
00:33:38,007 --> 00:33:39,702
Listen, listen, if you don't
tell us what you know,

693
00:33:39,742 --> 00:33:41,733
that gunman is free and he
is running the streets.

694
00:33:41,777 --> 00:33:43,972
If he hits his mark next time,
if he kills someone,

695
00:33:44,013 --> 00:33:44,980
that's on you.

696
00:33:45,014 --> 00:33:46,982
Yeah, well, guess what.
I can carry that.

697
00:33:47,016 --> 00:33:48,847
Okay, thanks
for your time.

698
00:33:52,722 --> 00:33:54,917
Uh, hi,
I'm J. H. Brodie.

699
00:33:54,957 --> 00:33:57,391
I used to work with
your dad at Homicide.

700
00:33:57,426 --> 00:33:58,188
Hello.

701
00:33:58,227 --> 00:33:59,922
Thank you for coming.

702
00:33:59,962 --> 00:34:02,590
I'm sorry. I was at D.C.
at a film festival

703
00:34:02,632 --> 00:34:03,724
and I heard
about the lieutenant.

704
00:34:03,766 --> 00:34:04,323
How's he doing?

705
00:34:04,367 --> 00:34:06,358
I brought him
this giraffe.

706
00:34:06,402 --> 00:34:08,427
Yeah, I can't get anybody
to tell me anything.

707
00:34:08,471 --> 00:34:10,234
I thought the ER doctors
were supposed to be

708
00:34:10,273 --> 00:34:12,207
so caring and compassionate
and all that crapola.

709
00:34:12,241 --> 00:34:14,675
Yeah, as far as I can tell,
nobody gives a tinker's damn.

710
00:34:17,947 --> 00:34:20,609
Do you think Al Giardello will
benefit from a sympathy factor?

711
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,811
Will this put you even further
behind in the polls?

712
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:25,787
Well, the polls be damned,
Donna, a man's life is at stake.

713
00:34:25,821 --> 00:34:28,255
Now, Al Giardello
and I may disagree

714
00:34:28,291 --> 00:34:29,690
on certain fundamental
issues.

715
00:34:29,725 --> 00:34:31,022
But when a tragedy
like this occurs,

716
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:34,826
it is essential that we put
these differences aside.

717
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:38,459
No, I'm not here today
as a candidate for mayor.

718
00:34:38,501 --> 00:34:42,301
I'm here today as a concerned
citizen and as a friend.

719
00:34:42,338 --> 00:34:43,498
- Sir. Sir.
- Now excuse me.

720
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,063
My dad hates
this guy's guts.

721
00:34:47,076 --> 00:34:48,373
How you holding up?

722
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:50,276
I'm all right.

723
00:34:50,313 --> 00:34:51,507
Good man.

724
00:34:57,453 --> 00:34:58,385
Huh.

725
00:34:58,421 --> 00:35:00,321
I have to admit,
white supremacists,

726
00:35:00,356 --> 00:35:02,881
I was thinking something
a little more south Baltimore.

727
00:35:02,925 --> 00:35:05,086
Yeah. Trailer park...

728
00:35:05,127 --> 00:35:08,824
broken down row house,
major appliance on the front stoop.

729
00:35:08,864 --> 00:35:09,990
Exactly. Not so--

730
00:35:10,032 --> 00:35:10,464
Quaint?

731
00:35:10,499 --> 00:35:11,727
Yeah, a little more, you know?

732
00:35:11,767 --> 00:35:12,631
White trash.

733
00:35:12,668 --> 00:35:14,135
You said it, not me.

734
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:16,161
Sure we got
the right address?

735
00:35:16,205 --> 00:35:17,797
Sure I'm sure.

736
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,400
You ever know me not to have
the right address?

737
00:35:20,443 --> 00:35:22,001
Don't answer that.

738
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:26,745
Can I help you
with something?

739
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,975
And the very identity
of this country

740
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:32,351
as a white, Christian nation
is in jeopardy.

741
00:35:32,388 --> 00:35:33,980
Aw, Jerry, I couldn't agree
with you more.

742
00:35:35,191 --> 00:35:37,125
But in the words
of Thomas Jefferson,

743
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:40,128
and Timothy Mc Veigh once wore
this on a t-shirt,

744
00:35:40,162 --> 00:35:42,187
''The tree of liberty must be
watered frequently

745
00:35:42,231 --> 00:35:45,064
with the blood of patriots,
and tyrants.''

746
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,162
Ladies and gentlemen,
stay with us.

747
00:35:49,205 --> 00:35:50,467
It looks like I'm about
to interview

748
00:35:50,506 --> 00:35:52,565
two of Baltimore City's Finest.

749
00:35:55,411 --> 00:36:01,577
When Al Giardello took a bullet,
I admit, I thought,

750
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,984
''Well, there's some damn
justice.''

751
00:36:05,021 --> 00:36:07,319
Where were you this morning,
Mrs. Desassy?

752
00:36:07,356 --> 00:36:09,381
Me? Right here.

753
00:36:09,425 --> 00:36:12,155
Making love to my bottle
of gin.

754
00:36:12,194 --> 00:36:14,128
You always start drinking
early in the morning?

755
00:36:14,163 --> 00:36:15,255
Nah.

756
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,094
No?

757
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:21,165
I don't start early 'cause
I don't stop the night before.

758
00:36:21,203 --> 00:36:23,296
Maybe you should get
some help.

759
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:24,363
Maybe you should shove
this bottle

760
00:36:24,407 --> 00:36:25,931
where the sun
don't shine.

761
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:30,605
You got anybody that can vouch for
your whereabouts this morning?

762
00:36:32,081 --> 00:36:34,572
My next door neighbor,
she was over here.

763
00:36:34,617 --> 00:36:35,743
Mooching a toot.

764
00:36:37,186 --> 00:36:39,450
We may need you
for further questioning.

765
00:36:41,123 --> 00:36:44,388
Hey, Ray and me, we was all
each other had in the world.

766
00:36:44,427 --> 00:36:45,860
You cops killed him.

767
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:55,433
I hope that Giardello dies
and goes straight to hell.

768
00:36:57,073 --> 00:36:59,564
Only wish I had shot
the bastard.

769
00:36:59,608 --> 00:37:00,905
Have a good day.

770
00:37:06,282 --> 00:37:08,375
Where were you
around 8:15 this morning?

771
00:37:08,417 --> 00:37:09,907
When Giardello got shot?

772
00:37:09,952 --> 00:37:10,714
Yeah.

773
00:37:12,254 --> 00:37:13,653
On the air.

774
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:14,849
And when the good news
came out,

775
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:17,154
across the Jewish controlled
mainstream media,

776
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,753
we popped a bottle of genuine
American sparkling wine

777
00:37:19,795 --> 00:37:21,023
and shared
the glad tidings

778
00:37:21,063 --> 00:37:22,621
with our listeners
across the country.

779
00:37:22,665 --> 00:37:24,132
Across the country?

780
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:26,157
Well, we reach most of our
followers by the Internet.

781
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,726
You can verify that you were
in the studio

782
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:28,930
at the time
of the shooting.

783
00:37:28,971 --> 00:37:29,960
I'll play you
the tapes.

784
00:37:30,005 --> 00:37:31,029
Don't bother.

785
00:37:31,073 --> 00:37:32,301
You could fake that.

786
00:37:32,341 --> 00:37:35,333
You could be on the air
and nowhere near this dump.

787
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,676
Then I'll make you a list
of people who were in and out

788
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:40,409
of the studio all morning
and saw me in the flesh.

789
00:37:40,449 --> 00:37:41,416
Yeah.

790
00:37:42,451 --> 00:37:44,078
Here's some paper.
Here's a pen.

791
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,314
Knock yourself out.

792
00:37:52,428 --> 00:37:54,919
Oh, I do wish we were
on the air right now.

793
00:37:54,964 --> 00:37:57,899
So I could describe you all
for the benefit of my audience.

794
00:37:57,933 --> 00:37:58,922
Why is that?

795
00:37:58,968 --> 00:38:02,426
Well, we talk all the time
on my program about mud people.

796
00:38:02,471 --> 00:38:03,563
You familiar with
the term?

797
00:38:03,606 --> 00:38:04,595
Yeah, I am.

798
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,574
It's one of our favorite
topics.

799
00:38:06,609 --> 00:38:09,476
Along with the evils
of race mixing.

800
00:38:09,512 --> 00:38:11,537
Just look at the two
of you.

801
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,480
Prime examples of both.

802
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:23,089
You gotta admit, they've come
a long way from the Grand Kleagle,

803
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:25,650
''Birth of a Nation,''
cross burning days.

804
00:38:25,694 --> 00:38:27,559
Yep, good old boys have
definitely traded in

805
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,120
their bedsheets
for Web sites.

806
00:38:29,165 --> 00:38:31,633
Assuming these check out,
Miller's not G's shooter.

807
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:33,999
He could have got somebody else
to pull the trigger for him.

808
00:38:34,036 --> 00:38:36,004
Or he might have
incited it.

809
00:38:36,038 --> 00:38:38,370
The shooter ends up being
one of his regular listeners,

810
00:38:38,407 --> 00:38:39,533
maybe we can
tie Miller in.

811
00:38:39,575 --> 00:38:41,509
Yeah, I'd love to tie him
into something.

812
00:38:41,544 --> 00:38:44,206
How many Black nationalist
groups are there in Baltimore?

813
00:38:44,246 --> 00:38:46,840
Many. Sheppard and Lewis
still checking the Aryan angle?

814
00:38:46,882 --> 00:38:50,045
Yeah. Baltimore.
City of brotherly love.

815
00:38:50,085 --> 00:38:50,983
That's Philadelphia.

816
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,282
Call me crazy,
but don't you think

817
00:38:52,321 --> 00:38:54,118
we should be switching
with Sheppard and Lewis?

818
00:38:54,156 --> 00:38:56,056
I mean, what's Gharty thinking,
anyway?

819
00:38:56,091 --> 00:38:57,058
John?

820
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,588
Billy Lou.

821
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,391
I heard you were in town.

822
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,091
Why didn't you come
to see me?

823
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:06,192
Billy Lou, this is my
old partner, Stan Bolander.

824
00:39:06,235 --> 00:39:07,395
Pleased to meet you.

825
00:39:07,436 --> 00:39:09,165
I guess you have to eat
your words

826
00:39:09,205 --> 00:39:10,866
about never coming back
to Charm City.

827
00:39:10,906 --> 00:39:12,134
When did I say that?

828
00:39:12,174 --> 00:39:13,801
Maybe I need
a cup of coffee.

829
00:39:13,843 --> 00:39:17,279
And telling everybody I ran off
with one of your colleagues.

830
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,406
Well, New York Cops,
they'll believe anything.

831
00:39:19,448 --> 00:39:21,814
Who did you have in mind?
Stuart?

832
00:39:22,918 --> 00:39:24,112
Stivers.

833
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:27,486
In your dreams.

834
00:39:27,523 --> 00:39:28,512
Maybe I'll see you later.

835
00:39:28,557 --> 00:39:30,115
You see, I got a lot
of work to do.

836
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,626
You know where
to find me.

837
00:39:36,265 --> 00:39:38,290
Is that the fourth
ex-Mrs. Munch?

838
00:39:38,734 --> 00:39:42,465
Yeah. You think maybe I'm not
cut out for the domestic life.

839
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,494
Okay.

840
00:39:44,807 --> 00:39:46,240
Guys like you and me.

841
00:39:46,275 --> 00:39:48,140
Work is where we shine.

842
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,109
Work.

843
00:40:05,461 --> 00:40:06,758
Excuse me.

844
00:40:06,795 --> 00:40:08,092
You in the right OR?

845
00:40:09,298 --> 00:40:10,560
Excuse me.

846
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:12,032
This is OR 5,
here, doctor.

847
00:40:22,811 --> 00:40:23,778
Security!

848
00:40:24,813 --> 00:40:26,280
There's been a shooting
in OR 5.

849
00:40:26,315 --> 00:40:28,306
Security! Security!

850
00:40:29,351 --> 00:40:30,511
He's been shot!

851
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,180
We got a code red! We need a
code red here!

852
00:40:32,688 --> 00:40:34,121
Code red! Code red!

853
00:40:37,493 --> 00:40:41,486
In a bizarre development,
shots were fired inside the hospital.

854
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:43,521
As you can see, QRT teams
have been called in.

855
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:46,433
They are to do a room by room
search of the building.

856
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,165
Police are now moving everyone
out of the hospital.

857
00:40:55,778 --> 00:40:56,802
Clear!

858
00:41:01,317 --> 00:41:02,306
Clear!

859
00:41:03,352 --> 00:41:04,376
Move around.

860
00:41:10,793 --> 00:41:12,158
Don, get in here.
Get in here!

861
00:41:15,564 --> 00:41:16,861
Clear!

862
00:41:20,002 --> 00:41:23,733
It's not clear at this point...

863
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:26,832
whether this incident is connected
with the shooting this morning

864
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:29,036
of mayoral candidate
Al Giardello.

865
00:41:29,078 --> 00:41:30,807
Ready? And up.

866
00:41:44,426 --> 00:41:47,224
We've got
90 over 60 still. Okay.

867
00:41:48,831 --> 00:41:51,356
Heart rate's at 130.
Heart rate's at 130.

868
00:41:57,673 --> 00:41:58,662
Clear!

869
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,573
You saw this dealer
at the rally this morning.

870
00:42:03,612 --> 00:42:07,241
Yeah, man. Easy Eddie Moe.
I know him all too well.

871
00:42:07,282 --> 00:42:09,113
Used to cop from him
when I was in the game.

872
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:10,846
Back in the day,
before I got clean.

873
00:42:10,886 --> 00:42:12,547
Why would he be at a rally
for Giardello?

874
00:42:12,588 --> 00:42:15,421
That's what I'm saying.
To take him down, maybe.

875
00:42:15,457 --> 00:42:17,391
Drug dealers are so flipped out
by the idea

876
00:42:17,426 --> 00:42:20,953
of Giardello being mayor,
man, they're registering to vote.

877
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:23,123
So where can we find
this Mr. Moe?

878
00:42:25,567 --> 00:42:27,694
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
baby, whoa... whoa.

879
00:42:30,439 --> 00:42:32,873
You might want to talk
to Bernie Weeks

880
00:42:32,908 --> 00:42:36,537
at the Shiny Foil Lounge.
Eddie used to work for him.

881
00:42:36,578 --> 00:42:38,705
Bernie Weeks...

882
00:42:38,747 --> 00:42:41,409
Wasn't he that dealer
we busted by mistake?

883
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:42,917
We were looking
for Manuel Rendero!

884
00:42:42,951 --> 00:42:44,885
Right.
He wasn't our shooter,

885
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,013
but he had 50 kilos of coke
in the trunk of his car.

886
00:42:47,056 --> 00:42:50,514
Yeah. And now he's back
on the street already.

887
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:51,457
Right.

888
00:42:53,796 --> 00:42:55,764
How could something
like this happen?

889
00:42:55,798 --> 00:42:57,629
We had officers posted
on every floor.

890
00:42:57,666 --> 00:42:59,827
How did the shooter get in?
If I were paranoid,

891
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,893
I'd say someone
in the department was involved.

892
00:43:01,937 --> 00:43:04,599
I'm gonna forget
you said that.

893
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,631
Has QRT s earched
the whole building?

894
00:43:06,675 --> 00:43:09,143
Yes. We'll catch him.
It's only a matter of time.

895
00:43:09,178 --> 00:43:11,009
- Hey, Mike.
- How's my father?

896
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,809
Another surgeon is working on him.
He didn't miss a beat.

897
00:43:12,848 --> 00:43:14,247
And the one who's shot?

898
00:43:14,283 --> 00:43:16,478
Second surgical team's
cutting into him now.

899
00:43:16,518 --> 00:43:18,349
Are we positive the two
shootings are related?

900
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,355
What are you talking about?
Of course they're related.

901
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:21,947
Maybe Dr. Williams
has enemies.

902
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:23,753
The shooter was after
my father.

903
00:43:23,792 --> 00:43:26,556
We won't know for until we can
get in there and investigate.

904
00:43:26,595 --> 00:43:28,688
Right now our Crime Scene
is still in OR.

905
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,995
Colonel Barnfather!

906
00:43:32,334 --> 00:43:34,325
- He's not in there.
- Damn!

907
00:43:34,369 --> 00:43:36,769
He must have escaped when
everybody was rushing out.

908
00:43:37,473 --> 00:43:39,600
Let's get everybody
back inside.

909
00:43:44,346 --> 00:43:45,973
Always--

910
00:43:46,014 --> 00:43:49,415
Always wondered myself why they
just didn't do what he said.

911
00:43:49,451 --> 00:43:52,352
Kick the bottom out of the market
by making the stuff legal.

912
00:43:52,387 --> 00:43:53,979
Put me out of business
like that.

913
00:43:55,023 --> 00:43:56,854
So, you're happy
Giardello got shot?

914
00:43:56,892 --> 00:44:00,020
No, I didn't say all that.
It could backfire,

915
00:44:00,062 --> 00:44:03,156
the... what you call it?
Sympathy vote.

916
00:44:03,198 --> 00:44:05,792
You know what our next
question is, don't you?

917
00:44:05,834 --> 00:44:08,428
- Do I got a alibi?
- Yeah.

918
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:10,233
Maybe I should just call
my attorney.

919
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:12,968
Whoa! You don't need
to lawyer up yet.

920
00:44:13,008 --> 00:44:14,600
Come on,
this is still friendly.

921
00:44:14,643 --> 00:44:16,076
You lawyer up, we gotta put you
in the system.

922
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:17,908
Waste of time
for all of us.

923
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:21,313
You Homicide, right?
You know anybody in Narcotics?

924
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:23,011
Yes, absolutely.

925
00:44:23,051 --> 00:44:25,383
You got any juice
with Steve Fletcher?

926
00:44:27,189 --> 00:44:29,157
I could talk to him, yeah.

927
00:44:29,191 --> 00:44:31,182
'Cause if you could get that
bastard off my back.

928
00:44:31,226 --> 00:44:33,160
I mean, he's camped out
on my front stoop.

929
00:44:33,195 --> 00:44:34,958
My oldest daughter
thinks he's gonna kill me.

930
00:44:34,997 --> 00:44:37,488
Just bust in the front door,
and grease me in my own bed.

931
00:44:37,533 --> 00:44:40,661
The stress is just
aggravating her ass.

932
00:44:40,702 --> 00:44:41,999
I'll speak to him.

933
00:44:43,038 --> 00:44:45,165
I ain't do Giardello.

934
00:44:45,207 --> 00:44:46,538
Well, how about
your crew?

935
00:44:46,575 --> 00:44:47,735
Them neither.

936
00:44:47,776 --> 00:44:48,970
Wait, wait, wait.

937
00:44:49,011 --> 00:44:52,503
We got an eyewitness, says that
Easy Eddie was at the rally.

938
00:44:52,548 --> 00:44:54,140
He don't work
for me no more.

939
00:44:54,183 --> 00:44:57,516
He was spending too much time
running his mouth about Giardello

940
00:44:57,553 --> 00:45:00,681
and not enough time
bringing me the cash money.

941
00:45:00,722 --> 00:45:02,417
Soon as it happened,
everybody thought

942
00:45:02,457 --> 00:45:04,084
the shooter
had to be Easy Eddie.

943
00:45:10,098 --> 00:45:11,759
Okay.

944
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,200
Okay, so we'll
give this to Gharty.

945
00:45:14,236 --> 00:45:17,103
And if this Easy Eddie Moe
is the shooter...

946
00:45:17,139 --> 00:45:19,471
then he's in the wind.

947
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,408
You and I are never gonna
be able to find him.

948
00:45:21,443 --> 00:45:22,467
Not on our own.

949
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:26,871
I could really use
a cup of coffee.

950
00:45:26,915 --> 00:45:28,906
Oh, y eah, good,
I'll be buying.

951
00:45:28,951 --> 00:45:31,010
No, no, I can't.

952
00:45:31,053 --> 00:45:32,452
Because of the stroke.

953
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:37,454
You know, for a minute,
I forgot.

954
00:45:37,492 --> 00:45:41,792
For a minute there, it s eemed
like time hadn't even gone by.

955
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,662
For a minute, it was
eight years ago.

956
00:45:49,471 --> 00:45:52,167
You know, Frank,
I never...

957
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,938
never told you
how much I...

958
00:45:55,978 --> 00:45:58,173
enjoyed having you
as a partner.

959
00:46:00,782 --> 00:46:02,773
You know,
how much I loved--

960
00:46:02,818 --> 00:46:04,342
working with you.

961
00:46:09,324 --> 00:46:11,588
You think maybe
a cop shot G?

962
00:46:12,661 --> 00:46:14,686
- What?
- A cop.

963
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,492
Why would a cop, one of us,
want to shoot G?

964
00:46:21,536 --> 00:46:22,662
I'm not talking
about one of us.

965
00:46:22,704 --> 00:46:24,228
I'm talking about a cop
with attitudes,

966
00:46:24,273 --> 00:46:26,173
with prejudices,
a redneck cop.

967
00:46:26,208 --> 00:46:28,039
Well, God knows there's plenty
of those around.

968
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:31,011
A Gaffney! A guy who'll put in
the time, walk the beat,

969
00:46:31,046 --> 00:46:33,276
he sees Giardello
making a reach for power,

970
00:46:33,315 --> 00:46:35,613
decides to...
change history.

971
00:46:35,651 --> 00:46:39,417
Yeah, yeah, that's a real
interesting idea, Frank.

972
00:46:39,454 --> 00:46:41,615
- Cops as killers.
- Happens.

973
00:46:41,657 --> 00:46:43,318
Kellerman plugged
Luther Mahoney.

974
00:46:43,358 --> 00:46:47,454
Still thinks some boy in blue
finished off, uh...

975
00:46:47,496 --> 00:46:49,760
- Gordon Pratt.
- Yeah, me, too.

976
00:46:49,798 --> 00:46:51,857
Hey, you know,
saying you're right--

977
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,698
saying that some law enforcement
officer shot Giardello--

978
00:46:54,736 --> 00:46:58,695
How do we find him?
Where do we start?

979
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,605
I don't know.

980
00:47:00,642 --> 00:47:02,405
Needle in a haystack.

981
00:47:04,146 --> 00:47:06,205
Let's go see how Ballard
and Stivers are doing

982
00:47:06,248 --> 00:47:07,909
with that videotape.

983
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:14,718
You know why
I left Homicide?

984
00:47:14,756 --> 00:47:16,417
Why?

985
00:47:18,493 --> 00:47:23,863
Because I could...
not... hear...

986
00:47:23,899 --> 00:47:26,732
one more...
confession.

987
00:47:31,006 --> 00:47:33,839
I got sick of hearing people
confess to me.

988
00:47:35,577 --> 00:47:37,101
Like some Jesuit.

989
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:40,603
I'd sit there in the box,
listening to some guy

990
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:43,482
not only admit to...

991
00:47:43,518 --> 00:47:46,351
having just
killed someone,

992
00:47:46,388 --> 00:47:48,015
but cop to all the other crap
in his life

993
00:47:48,056 --> 00:47:49,683
that over the course
of his life had...

994
00:47:50,959 --> 00:47:53,860
led him...
to that point.

995
00:47:55,764 --> 00:47:58,528
You would have made
a great Jesuit, Frank.

996
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:44,570
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee...

997
00:49:07,636 --> 00:49:10,070
I'm not gonna sugarcoat
reality for you.

998
00:49:10,105 --> 00:49:12,573
Internal damage,
substantial.

999
00:49:12,607 --> 00:49:14,507
Your father was shot twice
in the abdomen.

1000
00:49:14,543 --> 00:49:17,307
One bullet pierced
his right kidney and colon.

1001
00:49:17,345 --> 00:49:20,178
The other missed the vital organs
but pulverized a rib.

1002
00:49:20,215 --> 00:49:22,547
He's looking at several
more operations

1003
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:24,950
to fully repair the colon
and remove the damaged kidney.

1004
00:49:24,986 --> 00:49:27,250
And the risk of peritonitis
remains high.

1005
00:49:27,289 --> 00:49:28,688
Recovery is gonna take
some time,

1006
00:49:28,723 --> 00:49:31,157
but I think the long term
prognosis is good.

1007
00:49:31,193 --> 00:49:33,957
He's a very strong man.
His general health is excellent.

1008
00:49:33,995 --> 00:49:35,690
When do you think
I can talk to him?

1009
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:37,925
- I don't know.
- Well, that's refreshing.

1010
00:49:37,966 --> 00:49:39,490
A doctor who doesn't
know everything.

1011
00:49:39,534 --> 00:49:42,162
- You're welcome.
- Hey, I'm not thanking you.

1012
00:49:42,204 --> 00:49:44,399
I have been here all day
worried to death.

1013
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:46,498
I have big problems
with the way this place is run.

1014
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:50,434
I'm two under par on the 15th
green with a four foot gimme,

1015
00:49:50,479 --> 00:49:52,379
about to go to three under
when I get beeped.

1016
00:49:52,414 --> 00:49:54,245
I drop my club-- I don't even
take the shot.

1017
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:57,809
I got here-- OR is a war zone.
Kosovo on ice.

1018
00:49:57,853 --> 00:50:00,754
You'd rather we held your hand,
or saved your father's life?

1019
00:50:01,857 --> 00:50:02,949
Putz.

1020
00:50:04,726 --> 00:50:08,253
The gun, the gun.
Where the hell is the gun?

1021
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:10,093
Right there.
Pull it up.

1022
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,963
- This guy?
- No, that guy.

1023
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,661
You want to see what
he's holding in his hands?

1024
00:50:13,702 --> 00:50:14,691
Yeah, do your voodoo.

1025
00:50:14,736 --> 00:50:18,228
Okay, see, he's holding
something in his right hand.

1026
00:50:18,273 --> 00:50:19,240
Anything?

1027
00:50:19,274 --> 00:50:22,209
Maybe. Look, he's definitely
holding something.

1028
00:50:22,244 --> 00:50:24,735
- No, that's a tapere corder.
- A microcassette recorder.

1029
00:50:24,779 --> 00:50:26,178
Well, you guys
got anything?

1030
00:50:26,214 --> 00:50:29,479
A drug dealer with a grudge.
We passed that on to Gharty.

1031
00:50:29,518 --> 00:50:30,678
How far into these tapes
are you?

1032
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:32,880
- About halfway.
- You mind if we sit in?

1033
00:50:32,921 --> 00:50:34,388
- Not a problem.
- Please.

1034
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,632
- Let's go!
- Huh? What?

1035
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,133
I'm buying you
breakfast.

1036
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,159
What are you doing?
Get back in bed.

1037
00:50:48,203 --> 00:50:51,661
I feel fine.
Never felt better.

1038
00:50:51,706 --> 00:50:53,401
You've been shot twice.
You shouldn't be out of bed.

1039
00:50:53,441 --> 00:50:55,409
I feel fine.
Let's go down to Jimmy's

1040
00:50:55,443 --> 00:50:56,933
and get some scrapple.
Get some funnel cakes,

1041
00:50:56,978 --> 00:50:59,242
with frim-fram sauce,
chufafa on the side.

1042
00:50:59,281 --> 00:51:00,270
What?

1043
00:51:00,315 --> 00:51:02,340
Nat King Cole was a merry old soul.
A merry old soul was he.

1044
00:51:02,384 --> 00:51:05,012
Wait, wait, Pop. Are you sure
you should be doing this?

1045
00:51:05,053 --> 00:51:07,647
My cholesterol is down.
I'll risk it!

1046
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:09,020
I don't mean having breakfast
at Jimmy's.

1047
00:51:09,057 --> 00:51:10,615
I mean checking yourself
out of the hospital.

1048
00:51:10,659 --> 00:51:12,854
Don't ask, don't tell.
I won't if you won't.

1049
00:51:12,894 --> 00:51:15,522
Pop, you know you're not
making any sense.

1050
00:51:15,564 --> 00:51:17,156
Why don't you lay back down
and let me call a nurse?

1051
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,861
Sh-hh! Last one out
is a rotten egg.

1052
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:35,376
Mike?

1053
00:51:36,785 --> 00:51:38,377
Hello, Dr. Bristol.

1054
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,354
Do you know
Julianna Cox?

1055
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:42,754
She was my predecessor's
chief medical examiner.

1056
00:51:42,791 --> 00:51:45,089
Hi. I'm really sorry
to hear about your dad.

1057
00:51:45,126 --> 00:51:46,184
Thank you.

1058
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:49,459
We've been talking to his doctor
and getting the full story.

1059
00:51:50,865 --> 00:51:53,060
His prognosis
sounds promising.

1060
00:51:53,802 --> 00:51:56,771
Knowing G the way I do,
I'm sure he's gonna pull through.

1061
00:51:56,805 --> 00:51:59,933
Excuse me.
I gotta take a walk.

1062
00:52:12,654 --> 00:52:15,282
Hey, Mike? I'm gonna take
your grandmother home.

1063
00:52:15,323 --> 00:52:16,654
She's exhausted.

1064
00:52:16,691 --> 00:52:19,751
Oh, thanks, Megan.
Get some rest.

1065
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:27,901
Speaking of rest,
you could use some.

1066
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:31,929
- Grab some nap time.
- I'm too fired up to sleep.

1067
00:52:31,973 --> 00:52:34,100
- Will you call me later?
- Yeah.

1068
00:52:36,211 --> 00:52:38,236
Mike.

1069
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,271
They told me downstairs
your dad's out of surgery.

1070
00:52:40,315 --> 00:52:41,646
Yeah, yeah,
he's in ICU .

1071
00:52:41,683 --> 00:52:43,810
You hear anything from Homicide?
They catch the shooter?

1072
00:52:43,852 --> 00:52:48,721
- I've been so caught up here.
- I'm sure they're all over it.

1073
00:52:48,757 --> 00:52:50,315
I wanna go down there
in a little while anyway.

1074
00:52:50,358 --> 00:52:51,689
I have an idea I want
to tell Gharty about.

1075
00:52:51,726 --> 00:52:55,389
I could go with you.
I know I'm not a cop anymore.

1076
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:56,897
And there's a lot of people
who would be just as happy

1077
00:52:56,931 --> 00:53:00,890
never to see my mug again,
but G was always good to me.

1078
00:53:00,935 --> 00:53:02,402
And fair.

1079
00:53:02,437 --> 00:53:03,904
Yeah, sure.
Come on.

1080
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:05,803
Brodie!

1081
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,138
Hey, hey, I just filmed
a triple bypass operation.

1082
00:53:08,176 --> 00:53:08,835
It was awesome, man.

1083
00:53:08,877 --> 00:53:11,368
Do you guys know that this is
the very hospital

1084
00:53:11,413 --> 00:53:14,610
where Edgar Allan Poe
died of rabies?

1085
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:16,947
News to me. I guess
they must have remodeled.

1086
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:18,885
We're gonna head down
to headquarters for a while.

1087
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,512
If my dad comes to,
would you beep me?

1088
00:53:20,555 --> 00:53:21,522
Sure.

1089
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,453
That kidney is definitely
history.

1090
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:29,895
It is amazing
how effectively

1091
00:53:29,931 --> 00:53:31,694
they treat gunshot
traumas nowadays.

1092
00:53:31,733 --> 00:53:33,701
Even 10 years ago, these bad boys
would have been fatal.

1093
00:53:33,735 --> 00:53:35,464
The upside
of automatic weapons.

1094
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:38,199
They've expanded the boundaries
of medical science.

1095
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:40,673
Talk about
your silver lining.

1096
00:53:40,709 --> 00:53:43,075
Wish I knew what caliber.

1097
00:53:43,111 --> 00:53:44,703
What's your best guess?

1098
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:53,685
- It's odd.
- What?

1099
00:53:53,722 --> 00:53:56,452
I'm just not used to seeing
a body still breathing.

1100
00:53:56,491 --> 00:53:59,324
So judging from the damage,
the internal damage,

1101
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:05,257
the assassin was how far away
when he fired, would you say?

1102
00:54:06,234 --> 00:54:07,599
15 feet, max.

1103
00:54:07,635 --> 00:54:10,035
Maybe as much as 25?

1104
00:54:10,071 --> 00:54:12,869
No, no, the injuries
are much too severe for that.

1105
00:54:12,907 --> 00:54:15,341
Much too severe
for that distance.

1106
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:19,507
I would love to get in there,
and have a good look around.

1107
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:23,415
- Not that I want him...
- No, no, of course not.

1108
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:28,550
- I know what you mean, though.
- I'm sure you do.

1109
00:54:31,793 --> 00:54:33,454
When I first moved back
to Baltimore,

1110
00:54:33,495 --> 00:54:35,360
there were a series
of murders in Little Italy.

1111
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:37,160
- Your cousin, right?
- Mario.

1112
00:54:37,198 --> 00:54:38,256
Mario?

1113
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:40,792
It's Al.

1114
00:54:50,145 --> 00:54:52,773
Oh...

1115
00:54:52,814 --> 00:54:54,782
Oh, man...

1116
00:54:54,816 --> 00:54:57,080
Now eventually we caught
and we convicted

1117
00:54:57,118 --> 00:54:59,586
the two children of one
of Mario's enemies.

1118
00:54:59,621 --> 00:55:01,612
- Carlo Rolletta.
- Yeah, I remember.

1119
00:55:01,656 --> 00:55:03,521
Maybe another member
of Rolletta's family

1120
00:55:03,558 --> 00:55:05,389
is responsible
for Dad's shooting.

1121
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:07,622
- It's possible.
- Put one of your guys on it.

1122
00:55:07,662 --> 00:55:09,596
- I ought to put you on it.
- Me?

1123
00:55:09,631 --> 00:55:11,292
Yeah. You know the people
in that neighborhood,

1124
00:55:11,332 --> 00:55:12,492
they'll talk to you.

1125
00:55:12,534 --> 00:55:16,129
Oh, yeah.
Just casual conversation

1126
00:55:16,171 --> 00:55:18,605
between me
and some old friends.

1127
00:55:27,315 --> 00:55:29,010
You wanna talk
to me now?

1128
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:30,210
You wanna talk
to me now?

1129
00:55:39,694 --> 00:55:42,595
Talk! Talk!

1130
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:43,790
I'll talk!
I'll talk!

1131
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:04,783
You tell me!
Tell me what I wanna know!

1132
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,446
- All right.
- No, he knows!

1133
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,388
Mike!
Mike, enough.

1134
00:56:09,524 --> 00:56:10,718
Enough.

1135
00:56:12,293 --> 00:56:14,557
One of the things
your father taught me

1136
00:56:14,596 --> 00:56:16,086
was how to recognize
a dead end.

1137
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:17,722
- Dead end?
- Uh-huh.

1138
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,529
And this is a dead end.

1139
00:57:40,448 --> 00:57:41,506
Michael?

1140
00:57:45,787 --> 00:57:47,379
Michael?

1141
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,292
Dad?

1142
00:58:03,871 --> 00:58:05,532
Yeah?

1143
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,504
They get the guy
who shot me?

1144
00:58:08,543 --> 00:58:10,511
No, not yet.

1145
00:58:10,545 --> 00:58:13,309
But everybody is working
every side of the equation.

1146
00:58:13,348 --> 00:58:14,815
Including Bayliss
and Pembleton.

1147
00:58:14,849 --> 00:58:16,180
Pembleton?

1148
00:58:19,354 --> 00:58:21,584
That doesn't smell like
hospital food to me.

1149
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:23,853
Nonna brought me
some gnocchi.

1150
00:58:25,059 --> 00:58:27,323
But the doctor won't let me
eat any of it.

1151
00:58:27,362 --> 00:58:29,626
Mangia.

1152
00:58:29,664 --> 00:58:31,188
Grazie, but I wish
I had known.

1153
00:58:31,232 --> 00:58:33,860
I had just finished whipping down
some bad Chinese takeout.

1154
00:58:33,901 --> 00:58:35,892
Michael, because you became
a policeman,

1155
00:58:35,937 --> 00:58:37,768
doesn't mean you have
to eat like a dog.

1156
00:58:39,007 --> 00:58:41,942
Yeah, well,
you've always said that.

1157
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,534
When I went to Rome...

1158
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:50,583
We would sit down,
and have a two hour lunch...

1159
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:55,248
with three full courses,

1160
00:58:55,289 --> 00:58:57,587
and a good wine.

1161
00:58:57,625 --> 00:59:00,423
That's why the Romans
never get anything done.

1162
00:59:00,461 --> 00:59:02,759
But they knew
how to live.

1163
00:59:02,797 --> 00:59:05,561
That's important, Michael.

1164
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,966
I hear you.

1165
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:09,629
To know how to live...

1166
00:59:11,572 --> 00:59:15,406
in the little time
that we have.

1167
00:59:15,443 --> 00:59:18,901
Okay.
No more bad takeout.

1168
00:59:18,946 --> 00:59:20,504
Promise me.

1169
00:59:20,548 --> 00:59:23,244
I promise.

1170
00:59:23,284 --> 00:59:24,376
Bene.

1171
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:26,785
Okay.
That was Falsone.

1172
00:59:26,821 --> 00:59:29,346
That day-old dead drug dealer,
Yin-Yang Hardwick?

1173
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:31,255
What, that K.C. and Lewis
picked up this morning?

1174
00:59:31,292 --> 00:59:32,691
Yes. The lab boys did
a comparison of the slugs

1175
00:59:32,727 --> 00:59:35,719
out of G and our
dead dealer. Same gun.

1176
00:59:35,763 --> 00:59:38,095
We have a witness
that places a dealer

1177
00:59:38,132 --> 00:59:39,599
named Easy Eddie Moe
at the scene.

1178
00:59:39,634 --> 00:59:42,194
And another dealer that says
that Eddie had it in for G.

1179
00:59:42,236 --> 00:59:45,797
- Maybe Easy Eddie shot Yin-Yang.
- Yeah, maybe he did.

1180
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:49,037
Let's you and me meet Falsone,
see if we can help him out.

1181
00:59:49,077 --> 00:59:52,672
Maybe there's a connection between
Easy Eddie, Yin-Yang and G.

1182
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:55,911
Fine by me. I can't look
at these tapes another second.

1183
01:00:00,154 --> 01:00:01,621
Okay,
back it up for me.

1184
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:04,514
I was looking
out of my kitchen window

1185
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,459
and I saw the man,
clear as day.

1186
01:00:06,494 --> 01:00:08,018
Well-dressed.
Good-looking.

1187
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:10,895
Walked up the alley
to that boy, that Yin-Yang.

1188
01:00:10,932 --> 01:00:14,129
Spoke to him for a moment,
I figured he was buying drugs.

1189
01:00:14,168 --> 01:00:16,602
Then the well-dressed man
took out his gun

1190
01:00:16,637 --> 01:00:19,162
and shot that boy dead away.

1191
01:00:19,207 --> 01:00:21,141
- What did he look like?
- Who? Which one?

1192
01:00:21,175 --> 01:00:22,199
The well-dressed man.

1193
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:25,701
40 or so. Gray at the temples.
Beard. Glasses.

1194
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:26,679
- Distinguished.
- Black?

1195
01:00:26,714 --> 01:00:29,342
Oh, yes.
Blacker than you or me.

1196
01:00:29,383 --> 01:00:30,680
Sound like Easy Eddie
to you?

1197
01:00:30,718 --> 01:00:31,685
Not much.

1198
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,822
You watch these tapes
of G getting shot,

1199
01:00:36,858 --> 01:00:40,055
over and over, frame
by frame, in slo mo,

1200
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:42,995
the act itself stops
being shocking.

1201
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:44,895
That's the problem
with the job.

1202
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:47,400
Things stop shocking you.

1203
01:00:49,737 --> 01:00:52,672
You know that murderer,
Luke Ryland?

1204
01:00:52,707 --> 01:00:54,675
The one you said
made me jumpy.

1205
01:00:56,043 --> 01:00:57,840
Those women that he killed,
those murders,

1206
01:00:57,879 --> 01:00:59,676
they still shocked me.
They angered me.

1207
01:00:59,714 --> 01:01:03,115
Good-- whoa!
What's that? Go back.

1208
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:07,944
Wow, you see that?

1209
01:01:07,989 --> 01:01:09,183
Wow!

1210
01:01:09,223 --> 01:01:12,215
That's pop-pop-pop...
followed by a puff of white smoke--

1211
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:14,194
Pow! Right here.
Just a wisp.

1212
01:01:14,228 --> 01:01:15,092
- Right...
- Where?

1213
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:17,222
Okay, hold on.
Go forward.

1214
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:22,100
- I still don't see it.
- Okay, give it to me bigger.

1215
01:01:24,372 --> 01:01:25,771
Okay.

1216
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:28,298
Daniels,
cameraman.

1217
01:01:31,345 --> 01:01:32,403
See that?

1218
01:01:32,446 --> 01:01:34,209
Well, it could be,
I just didn't see a gun.

1219
01:01:34,248 --> 01:01:35,681
I mean, where's
the gun?

1220
01:01:35,716 --> 01:01:38,150
I don't know...
Boom.

1221
01:01:38,186 --> 01:01:39,619
But if this smoke
is coming from a gun,

1222
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:41,519
then it's right next
to the Y.A.T. cameraman.

1223
01:01:42,557 --> 01:01:43,819
Pow!

1224
01:01:43,858 --> 01:01:44,790
You hear that?

1225
01:01:47,295 --> 01:01:49,991
You're saying the shooter
was the cameraman from WYAT?

1226
01:01:50,031 --> 01:01:51,794
Maybe, maybe.

1227
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:55,166
Now this is tape
from channel 11.

1228
01:01:56,537 --> 01:01:58,528
See that, see that puff
of white smoke?

1229
01:01:58,573 --> 01:01:59,301
Yeah, I see it.

1230
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,399
That's with
the pop-pop-pop.

1231
01:02:01,442 --> 01:02:03,467
Not just showing him
with the gun?

1232
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:05,342
No, no, of all the tape
that we looked through,

1233
01:02:05,379 --> 01:02:07,313
there's no gun visible
from any angle.

1234
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:09,145
You feel there's
something to this?

1235
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:10,172
Could be.

1236
01:02:10,218 --> 01:02:12,709
Yeah. Frank and me,
we'll go suss it out.

1237
01:02:12,753 --> 01:02:14,584
Yeah, well, Bayliss,
you go, but,

1238
01:02:14,622 --> 01:02:15,782
Pembleton, um...

1239
01:02:15,823 --> 01:02:17,916
I think you should
back off right now.

1240
01:02:20,394 --> 01:02:21,588
Right now?

1241
01:02:21,629 --> 01:02:23,688
It's not my decision.

1242
01:02:23,731 --> 01:02:25,562
You saw, I had my lunch
handed to me

1243
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,363
for letting you take over
that homeless guy.

1244
01:02:27,401 --> 01:02:29,733
When Bayliss called in the tip
on Easy Eddie Moe,

1245
01:02:29,770 --> 01:02:31,465
I knew you guys
were working out there.

1246
01:02:31,505 --> 01:02:33,700
I didn't say squat.
But this is...

1247
01:02:33,741 --> 01:02:38,610
It's not like I ever had
a lot of respect for you, okay?

1248
01:02:39,847 --> 01:02:41,178
But what are you doing?

1249
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:43,843
Putting up with this nonsense
from Gaffney.

1250
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:46,251
I had to get off
the street.

1251
01:02:46,287 --> 01:02:48,414
I could smell it.

1252
01:02:48,456 --> 01:02:51,391
I wasn't gonna last.

1253
01:02:51,425 --> 01:02:54,121
I live with Gaffney
and the rest of the brass

1254
01:02:54,161 --> 01:02:55,856
because that's what
this job is.

1255
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:57,626
I'm just a stooge.
I know that.

1256
01:02:57,665 --> 01:02:59,963
But it's better
than being out there.

1257
01:03:00,001 --> 01:03:01,866
Al Giardello had nothing
but respect for you.

1258
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:03,962
He stood up for you.
For the rest of his men.

1259
01:03:04,005 --> 01:03:06,337
Covered our asses and didn't
give a crap about Gaffney

1260
01:03:06,374 --> 01:03:08,672
or anybody else because it was
all about putting down the cases.

1261
01:03:08,709 --> 01:03:10,006
So take a cue from G.

1262
01:03:10,044 --> 01:03:12,012
See, you're heading
a detective squad...

1263
01:03:13,881 --> 01:03:15,906
and they're
looking to you.

1264
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:21,120
Give them something...

1265
01:03:26,327 --> 01:03:28,352
or else walk
the hell away.

1266
01:03:30,097 --> 01:03:32,361
All right, all right,
wait, wait, wait. Hold.

1267
01:03:35,636 --> 01:03:38,002
Go over to YAT and find out
who this guy is.

1268
01:03:42,009 --> 01:03:44,102
That was spoken
like a champ.

1269
01:03:44,679 --> 01:03:46,738
A true murder police.

1270
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:48,180
Kiss my ass.

1271
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:56,249
The guy you're looking for,
his name's Eric Thomas James.

1272
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:58,190
Okay, is he still
on the job?

1273
01:03:58,225 --> 01:04:00,887
He was down at the hospital,
but he's off now.

1274
01:04:00,928 --> 01:04:02,691
We'll need
his home address.

1275
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:05,460
You have any idea what he thinks
about Al Giardello?

1276
01:04:05,499 --> 01:04:08,127
I don't have a clue.
I never heard him talk politics.

1277
01:04:08,169 --> 01:04:09,158
I don't know anything
about the man at all.

1278
01:04:09,203 --> 01:04:13,003
He's a freelancer.
Works weekends, evenings.

1279
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,871
He comes and goes.
What can I tell you?

1280
01:04:14,909 --> 01:04:16,934
He's a cameraman.
He's removed.

1281
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:20,277
He sits behind his lens
and observes people.

1282
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:23,613
Cameramen. They're a little ''hinky,''
if you know what I mean.

1283
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:37,522
Mr. James?
Eric Thomas James?

1284
01:04:37,565 --> 01:04:38,463
Yes.

1285
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:40,865
Detective Bayliss,
Baltimore Homicide.

1286
01:04:40,901 --> 01:04:42,630
This is my partner.

1287
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:43,728
Frank Pembleton.

1288
01:04:44,805 --> 01:04:48,070
I suppose you better
come in, yeah.

1289
01:04:50,978 --> 01:04:52,969
I've got some coffee here.
Would you like some coffee?

1290
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:55,642
- No, thank you.
- I'll take a cup. Sure.

1291
01:04:57,985 --> 01:05:00,977
I know it's late,

1292
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:02,649
but I don't sleep much.

1293
01:05:03,891 --> 01:05:06,121
Well, neither do I.
Thank you.

1294
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,058
You're welcome.

1295
01:05:11,365 --> 01:05:13,765
I've been expecting you.

1296
01:05:13,801 --> 01:05:15,701
Why is that?

1297
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:25,377
See this?
It's my boy's room.

1298
01:05:26,447 --> 01:05:28,278
Any weapons in the house,
Mr. James?

1299
01:05:28,315 --> 01:05:30,112
- I don't have a gun.
- Well, just having a check.

1300
01:05:30,151 --> 01:05:32,483
Were you at the Inner Harbor
this morning, Mr. James?

1301
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:35,512
- And at the hospital?
- I was working.

1302
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:37,456
But I'm going
to show you something, okay?

1303
01:05:38,626 --> 01:05:41,925
It's my boy.
It's my son, Tommy.

1304
01:05:41,962 --> 01:05:43,987
You know...?

1305
01:05:44,031 --> 01:05:46,226
No, look.

1306
01:05:46,267 --> 01:05:47,757
He's got it all.

1307
01:05:47,802 --> 01:05:51,704
He's got smarts...
and he's good looking,

1308
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:53,570
and he's got
girlfriends, and...

1309
01:05:54,408 --> 01:05:56,808
He's gonna make his mark.

1310
01:05:56,844 --> 01:05:59,108
He's gonna leave his imprint
on the world.

1311
01:05:59,146 --> 01:06:01,011
He's just got
his license, and...

1312
01:06:01,048 --> 01:06:03,209
me and the wife,
we're gonna,

1313
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:06,549
get a hold of a used car,
you know, for college.

1314
01:06:06,587 --> 01:06:09,613
And where is
Mrs. James?

1315
01:06:09,657 --> 01:06:12,091
Who knows?

1316
01:06:12,126 --> 01:06:13,787
She left.

1317
01:06:14,662 --> 01:06:17,927
I don't know,
a couple weeks ago, she just...

1318
01:06:17,965 --> 01:06:18,932
left.

1319
01:06:19,834 --> 01:06:21,631
Buffalo.
No, Buffalo.

1320
01:06:21,669 --> 01:06:23,296
- Her sister.
- Sit down.

1321
01:06:23,337 --> 01:06:25,862
But I haven't called her,
she hasn't...

1322
01:06:28,042 --> 01:06:30,067
I don't have the energy.

1323
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:32,272
You haven't asked, but...

1324
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,771
Yes...

1325
01:06:35,816 --> 01:06:39,547
I shot that man
this morning. Giardello.

1326
01:06:40,588 --> 01:06:43,751
Mr. James, we're going to have
to advise you of your rights.

1327
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:45,850
My rights?

1328
01:06:45,893 --> 01:06:48,828
I have the right to have things
as they were three months ago.

1329
01:06:49,730 --> 01:06:51,459
I play by the rules.

1330
01:06:51,499 --> 01:06:53,433
I pay my taxes.
I cut my lawn.

1331
01:06:53,467 --> 01:06:55,458
I mean, that's what you're
supposed to do, right?

1332
01:06:55,503 --> 01:06:58,131
So, I don't deserve
to have my son die.

1333
01:06:58,172 --> 01:06:59,730
Your son is dead?

1334
01:06:59,773 --> 01:07:01,104
Yes.

1335
01:07:02,943 --> 01:07:04,672
Well, I'm sorry.

1336
01:07:04,712 --> 01:07:06,612
Why?

1337
01:07:06,647 --> 01:07:08,979
No one should have
a child that dies.

1338
01:07:10,351 --> 01:07:13,047
Maybe you should tell that
to all those bigshots.

1339
01:07:13,087 --> 01:07:15,555
You know,
want to legalize drugs,

1340
01:07:15,589 --> 01:07:17,523
give everybody the right
to get high on whatever they want.

1341
01:07:17,558 --> 01:07:18,786
Okay, okay.

1342
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:22,085
You've admitted shooting
Al Giardello?

1343
01:07:22,129 --> 01:07:23,323
Yes, I shot him.

1344
01:07:23,364 --> 01:07:24,888
I wanted to kill him.

1345
01:07:24,932 --> 01:07:27,366
But, hey, why should I expect
to be a sharpshooter?

1346
01:07:27,401 --> 01:07:31,895
And why should I expect my son,
go all the way into Baltimore,

1347
01:07:31,939 --> 01:07:33,406
buy his dope...

1348
01:07:34,942 --> 01:07:38,275
and OD...
right on the street.

1349
01:07:38,312 --> 01:07:41,406
And his friends-- why?
Why did they leave him?

1350
01:07:41,448 --> 01:07:42,437
Why did they leave him
on the street?

1351
01:07:42,483 --> 01:07:44,713
They just left him
there to die.

1352
01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:48,746
Three months ago
to the day.

1353
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:52,891
This is how he left
his room, you see?

1354
01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:01,859
I'm sorry
about the doctor, okay?

1355
01:08:01,902 --> 01:08:03,369
I never meant that.

1356
01:08:03,404 --> 01:08:04,530
And...

1357
01:08:05,606 --> 01:08:08,871
I meant to shoot the drug dealer
who sold my Tommy the drugs.

1358
01:08:08,909 --> 01:08:11,810
And that man, Giardello, because
he was trying to legalize drugs.

1359
01:08:11,845 --> 01:08:14,575
That's what
I'm trying to stop.

1360
01:08:14,615 --> 01:08:17,584
I'll shoot whoever
says it's okay.

1361
01:08:17,618 --> 01:08:20,143
I'm just trying to save
all those innocent kids.

1362
01:08:21,622 --> 01:08:23,385
I understand...

1363
01:08:27,094 --> 01:08:28,083
Yeah.

1364
01:08:29,663 --> 01:08:33,258
You know what, I don't have
any cuffs on me, Frank.

1365
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:35,300
You don't need them.

1366
01:08:48,215 --> 01:08:49,546
Hey, hey.

1367
01:09:22,049 --> 01:09:23,346
He had the gun
attached to the camera,

1368
01:09:23,384 --> 01:09:25,011
which is why
no one saw it.

1369
01:09:25,052 --> 01:09:27,111
And it's right here
that...

1370
01:09:27,154 --> 01:09:29,748
he keeps the camera rolling
after he shoots G.

1371
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:32,691
Although he neglected
to turn the cassette in to YAT.

1372
01:09:32,726 --> 01:09:36,218
We show this tape in court,
Eric Thomas James is done.

1373
01:09:36,263 --> 01:09:38,322
We got two counts
of attempted murder:

1374
01:09:38,365 --> 01:09:41,528
Giardello and Dr. Williams.
30 years each.

1375
01:09:41,568 --> 01:09:43,627
Not to mention
the spare change he'll pick up

1376
01:09:43,671 --> 01:09:45,901
for killing the drug dealer.

1377
01:09:45,939 --> 01:09:47,270
Congratulations.

1378
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:48,400
Thanks.

1379
01:09:50,611 --> 01:09:52,238
I'll need you both
to testify.

1380
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:56,540
Yeah, yeah,
we'll be there.

1381
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:02,315
I know
how James feels.

1382
01:10:02,356 --> 01:10:04,415
You gotta stop those
that are gonna hurt the innocent.

1383
01:10:04,458 --> 01:10:07,484
James is a lunatic.
He's certifiable.

1384
01:10:07,528 --> 01:10:10,326
His son gets killed.
He's gotta do something.

1385
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,127
Hey, say, uh...

1386
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:19,464
Say one of your kids
gets hooked on drugs.

1387
01:10:19,506 --> 01:10:22,236
- One of my kids what?
- Gets hooked.

1388
01:10:22,276 --> 01:10:25,302
- They wouldn't.
- Just say that they did.

1389
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:27,974
They're not going to.
It's not gonna happen.

1390
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:29,573
Case closed.

1391
01:10:29,616 --> 01:10:32,813
You have no sympathy for James,
for what he's going through?

1392
01:10:32,853 --> 01:10:34,878
James is trying to lay
the blame on G,

1393
01:10:34,922 --> 01:10:37,550
because in his heart of hearts
he knows that he's responsible

1394
01:10:37,591 --> 01:10:39,582
for what happens
to his kid.

1395
01:10:39,626 --> 01:10:42,720
I appreciate
how he feels.

1396
01:10:42,763 --> 01:10:45,231
You can appreciate it
all you want to, Tim,

1397
01:10:45,265 --> 01:10:48,200
but there's a line
between right and wrong.

1398
01:10:48,235 --> 01:10:50,795
Yeah, well, you're the expert
on that, Frank.

1399
01:10:50,838 --> 01:10:54,001
Nothing lumpy about you.
You know all.

1400
01:10:57,745 --> 01:10:59,406
The city looks clean
tonight.

1401
01:11:00,547 --> 01:11:03,072
We can't all be you,
Frank.

1402
01:11:03,117 --> 01:11:05,517
Think I'm gonna take my wife
out to dinner in the harbor.

1403
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:08,419
Sometimes you can lose
your bearings.

1404
01:11:08,455 --> 01:11:11,549
Sometimes, the line
isn't so clear.

1405
01:11:11,592 --> 01:11:13,219
Of course the line
is clear.

1406
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:14,818
There's good,
there's evil.

1407
01:11:14,862 --> 01:11:16,659
You never shot anyone,
did you?

1408
01:11:16,697 --> 01:11:17,664
- No.
- No.

1409
01:11:17,698 --> 01:11:19,723
And you never would?

1410
01:11:19,767 --> 01:11:21,826
I never had to.
I've been lucky.

1411
01:11:21,869 --> 01:11:24,736
Yeah.
The righteous cop.

1412
01:11:24,772 --> 01:11:27,297
Line's always been
clear to you.

1413
01:11:27,341 --> 01:11:28,968
Not always.

1414
01:11:32,312 --> 01:11:33,939
Time for one more
confession, Frank.

1415
01:11:34,782 --> 01:11:36,409
Defendant is set free.

1416
01:11:37,451 --> 01:11:38,475
Confession?

1417
01:11:40,621 --> 01:11:42,213
I killed a man.

1418
01:11:45,559 --> 01:11:47,186
I'm not in the mood,
all right?

1419
01:11:47,227 --> 01:11:48,216
Luke Ryland.

1420
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:50,059
Be seeing you,
detectives.

1421
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:50,722
Who?

1422
01:11:50,764 --> 01:11:52,231
I shot the bastard
dead.

1423
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,334
Good.
''Go to jail.

1424
01:11:55,369 --> 01:11:56,961
Go directly to jail.
Do not pass Go--''

1425
01:11:57,004 --> 01:11:59,598
I'm not kidding, Frank.
I killed him.

1426
01:12:01,241 --> 01:12:03,266
Come on, Tim.
You couldn't kill anybody.

1427
01:12:03,310 --> 01:12:05,369
Frank, he got off
on a technicality.

1428
01:12:05,412 --> 01:12:06,242
Defendant is set free.

1429
01:12:07,648 --> 01:12:09,843
The bastard had to die
before he went out

1430
01:12:09,883 --> 01:12:11,282
and he murdered
another innocent woman.

1431
01:12:16,490 --> 01:12:18,355
Don't screw with me.

1432
01:12:20,394 --> 01:12:22,487
You killed this, whoever?

1433
01:12:22,529 --> 01:12:23,860
Luke Ryland.

1434
01:12:26,433 --> 01:12:27,866
Internal cleared you?

1435
01:12:27,901 --> 01:12:28,959
Frank...

1436
01:12:29,002 --> 01:12:31,232
I'm saying that I hunted
the bastard down,

1437
01:12:31,271 --> 01:12:33,831
and when I found him,
I blew his brains out.

1438
01:12:33,874 --> 01:12:36,638
I executed him
in cold blood.

1439
01:12:36,677 --> 01:12:39,669
And I'm saying, Internal
rules this as a good shooting?

1440
01:12:39,713 --> 01:12:40,270
No, no.

1441
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:42,646
Internal doesn't know crap
about me killing Ryland.

1442
01:12:42,683 --> 01:12:45,049
You're standing here
telling me you killed somebody?

1443
01:12:45,085 --> 01:12:46,712
Yes.

1444
01:12:46,753 --> 01:12:48,118
In self defense?

1445
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:48,780
No.

1446
01:12:48,822 --> 01:12:49,846
You're standing there
with your weapon,

1447
01:12:49,890 --> 01:12:51,585
and it went off,
and you don't remember how.

1448
01:12:51,625 --> 01:12:52,922
Frank--

1449
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,018
Guns go off accidentally.
Happens all the time.

1450
01:12:54,061 --> 01:12:55,494
It was no accident.

1451
01:12:55,529 --> 01:12:57,326
No, I'm saying
this is an accident.

1452
01:12:57,364 --> 01:12:59,161
For you to shoot somebody?
It's gotta be a mistake.

1453
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:00,564
No, no, no.
It's no mistake.

1454
01:13:00,601 --> 01:13:02,466
- No accident.
- Tim...!

1455
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:05,904
- Frank, you're a good cop.
- I'm not a cop anymore.

1456
01:13:05,939 --> 01:13:07,770
No, you're always
gonna be a cop.

1457
01:13:07,808 --> 01:13:10,003
No, I'm a teacher.
I teach. Civilians.

1458
01:13:10,043 --> 01:13:12,443
No-- I murdered
this son of a bitch,

1459
01:13:12,479 --> 01:13:14,572
because he was
a predator, Frank.

1460
01:13:14,615 --> 01:13:16,606
He preyed on women.

1461
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:17,947
What?
Why are you doing this?

1462
01:13:17,985 --> 01:13:19,816
I put the gun right up
to the mother's brain

1463
01:13:19,853 --> 01:13:21,377
and I pulled the trigger.

1464
01:13:21,421 --> 01:13:22,820
Shut up!
Just shut up!

1465
01:13:34,201 --> 01:13:35,463
You put this on me.

1466
01:13:36,603 --> 01:13:38,537
You son of a bitch.

1467
01:13:38,572 --> 01:13:41,473
In here, I know
that I did right.

1468
01:13:44,111 --> 01:13:46,841
But for here...

1469
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:49,849
So you waited till I came back,
so you could...

1470
01:13:51,184 --> 01:13:52,674
unload this...?

1471
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:56,516
Unburden yourself?

1472
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:58,787
- What's supposed to happen now?
- You tell me.

1473
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:03,492
I'm not bringing you in.

1474
01:14:03,530 --> 01:14:04,656
No, huh?

1475
01:14:04,698 --> 01:14:06,256
I'm not a cop.
It's not official.

1476
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:09,599
Really? What are you
going to do, not say a word?

1477
01:14:09,636 --> 01:14:10,933
Gonna keep my little secret
to yourself?

1478
01:14:10,971 --> 01:14:13,098
Son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!

1479
01:14:14,841 --> 01:14:16,672
You murdered him.

1480
01:14:16,710 --> 01:14:18,507
I executed him, Frank.

1481
01:14:20,647 --> 01:14:22,308
Who was the primary?

1482
01:14:22,349 --> 01:14:24,374
- Lewis.
- You talk to him?

1483
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:26,181
No. I came to you first.

1484
01:14:26,219 --> 01:14:27,516
Who else would I tell, Frank?

1485
01:14:27,554 --> 01:14:30,079
But did you talk to Lewis?

1486
01:14:30,123 --> 01:14:31,852
About this case? No.

1487
01:14:31,892 --> 01:14:33,587
So nobody suspects
you're the shooter?

1488
01:14:33,627 --> 01:14:36,187
No...
no, man...

1489
01:14:37,164 --> 01:14:38,495
Suspect me?

1490
01:14:38,532 --> 01:14:41,160
Good ol' Tim Bayliss,
the Zen detective?

1491
01:14:44,071 --> 01:14:44,765
Huh.

1492
01:14:45,872 --> 01:14:49,035
So, you...

1493
01:14:49,076 --> 01:14:50,941
you'll take me in.

1494
01:14:50,978 --> 01:14:52,707
I'm gonna take you in.
Are you wild?

1495
01:14:52,746 --> 01:14:54,213
No.

1496
01:14:54,247 --> 01:14:56,044
You'll take me in, Frank.

1497
01:14:56,083 --> 01:14:57,050
No.

1498
01:14:59,653 --> 01:15:02,019
Did I take...
a bullet for you?

1499
01:15:02,055 --> 01:15:03,215
No, no.
Cut it out.

1500
01:15:03,256 --> 01:15:05,656
- Did I take a bullet for you?
- I'm not taking you in--

1501
01:15:05,692 --> 01:15:06,750
Did I take a bullet for you?

1502
01:15:06,793 --> 01:15:09,455
I take a bullet for you,
and you take a bullet for me.

1503
01:15:09,496 --> 01:15:10,690
Now that is
square business, Frank.

1504
01:15:10,731 --> 01:15:12,062
This is not
taking a bullet for you.

1505
01:15:12,099 --> 01:15:14,329
This is you wanting me to toss
your ass in the junkpile.

1506
01:15:14,368 --> 01:15:17,132
You're confessing to a murder.
Do you understand that?

1507
01:15:17,170 --> 01:15:19,001
You want someone else
should take me in?

1508
01:15:19,039 --> 01:15:20,666
Someone else should bust me.
Is that what you want?

1509
01:15:20,707 --> 01:15:22,299
- No.
- Then it has to be you.

1510
01:15:22,342 --> 01:15:24,333
No, no, no.

1511
01:15:24,378 --> 01:15:26,642
Frank, listen.
Listen to me.

1512
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:29,240
I've thought about eating my gun,
and I'm gonna eat that gun--

1513
01:15:29,282 --> 01:15:31,773
right now-- if you don't
do the right thing for me, Frank!

1514
01:15:31,818 --> 01:15:34,753
For right here!
I have no other...

1515
01:15:34,788 --> 01:15:36,779
no other option, Frank.

1516
01:15:36,823 --> 01:15:39,155
Please...?

1517
01:15:39,192 --> 01:15:41,251
You thought about putting
a gun to yourself?

1518
01:15:41,294 --> 01:15:42,921
Yeah.

1519
01:15:42,963 --> 01:15:45,363
You'd be saving my life.
I don't know for how long.

1520
01:15:45,399 --> 01:15:47,799
For now.
At least you would.

1521
01:15:47,834 --> 01:15:51,668
I believe that you did not mean
to do this killing.

1522
01:15:55,842 --> 01:15:57,867
You believe
what you want to believe.

1523
01:15:59,079 --> 01:16:00,444
That's okay.

1524
01:16:01,648 --> 01:16:04,583
So we're gonna
turn around...

1525
01:16:04,618 --> 01:16:07,416
right now...

1526
01:16:07,454 --> 01:16:09,615
and we're gonna go
back inside...

1527
01:16:10,657 --> 01:16:12,625
okay?

1528
01:16:23,136 --> 01:16:25,570
Never put off
the inevitable, Frank.

1529
01:16:30,644 --> 01:16:33,340
It's gotta be
what it's gotta be.

1530
01:16:38,952 --> 01:16:40,476
Son of a bitch.

1531
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:46,954
Frank...

1532
01:16:49,763 --> 01:16:51,697
If you absolve me...

1533
01:16:53,033 --> 01:16:54,432
Absolve you?

1534
01:17:05,178 --> 01:17:06,611
I can't.

1535
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:12,651
Can't?

1536
01:17:15,489 --> 01:17:18,049
That's remarkable,
I mean...

1537
01:17:18,091 --> 01:17:20,218
'cause I was certain
that you could.

1538
01:17:49,689 --> 01:17:51,316
I think maybe...

1539
01:17:52,626 --> 01:17:55,117
Mary and I are going
to stay home tonight.

1540
01:17:57,397 --> 01:17:59,490
Have dinner
with the kids.

1541
01:18:22,722 --> 01:18:23,882
Thank you.

1542
01:18:23,924 --> 01:18:25,983
I would like to make
a toast, actually.

1543
01:18:26,026 --> 01:18:29,189
To Al Giardello...
too badass to die.

1544
01:18:31,064 --> 01:18:32,622
And to Bayliss
and Pembleton.

1545
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:34,224
Where are Bayliss
and Pembleton?

1546
01:18:34,267 --> 01:18:35,291
Oh, come on, do you really
expect to see

1547
01:18:35,335 --> 01:18:38,327
the notoriously antisocial
Frank Pembleton here?

1548
01:18:38,371 --> 01:18:39,963
- What about Bayliss?
- Who knows?

1549
01:18:40,006 --> 01:18:41,303
Yeah, really,
who does know?

1550
01:18:41,341 --> 01:18:42,865
What's up with that
Bayliss anyway?

1551
01:18:42,909 --> 01:18:44,672
Is he pitching,
or is he catching?

1552
01:18:46,613 --> 01:18:47,807
Who cares?

1553
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:49,042
Hey, hey,
I'm making a toast.

1554
01:18:49,082 --> 01:18:51,243
It's bad luck
not to finish the toast.

1555
01:18:51,284 --> 01:18:52,148
Says who?

1556
01:18:52,185 --> 01:18:53,209
Says me.

1557
01:18:53,253 --> 01:18:55,414
So, to Bayliss
and Pembleton,

1558
01:18:55,455 --> 01:18:57,286
who doggedly pursued
the case,

1559
01:18:57,324 --> 01:19:00,020
despite interference
from the bosses,

1560
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:02,494
and brought the shooter
to justice.

1561
01:19:02,529 --> 01:19:04,520
And to new friends.

1562
01:19:04,564 --> 01:19:06,156
And old friends.

1563
01:19:06,199 --> 01:19:08,724
To pathological friends.

1564
01:19:10,470 --> 01:19:12,404
Hey, you know, Lewis,
I really love this joint.

1565
01:19:12,439 --> 01:19:13,906
Maybe I will be
your partner.

1566
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:15,305
You serious, man?

1567
01:19:15,342 --> 01:19:16,832
I'll sell you my third
in a New York minute.

1568
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:18,367
Not so fast.
We're still married.

1569
01:19:18,411 --> 01:19:19,935
I own half
of your third.

1570
01:19:22,415 --> 01:19:23,746
Hey, hey, Tony!

1571
01:19:25,218 --> 01:19:27,015
Tony! Tony! Tony!

1572
01:19:29,456 --> 01:19:31,014
I was at the hospital.

1573
01:19:31,057 --> 01:19:32,115
So what's the latest?

1574
01:19:34,494 --> 01:19:35,756
He died.

1575
01:19:37,764 --> 01:19:40,324
Lieutenant Giardello died.

1576
01:19:40,367 --> 01:19:41,925
That's not funny, son.

1577
01:19:41,968 --> 01:19:43,265
Wasn't meant to be funny.

1578
01:19:43,970 --> 01:19:46,370
Doctor said it was
some kind of aneurysm.

1579
01:19:46,406 --> 01:19:50,206
It was fast.
And there was no pain.

1580
01:19:52,078 --> 01:19:53,841
No pain, huh?

1581
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:55,211
That's what the doctor said.

1582
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:49,394
Hello,
I'm Frank Pembleton.

1583
01:21:49,429 --> 01:21:51,021
Mike Giardello.

1584
01:21:51,064 --> 01:21:53,362
I heard about G.
I'm sorry.

1585
01:21:54,901 --> 01:21:56,493
Thanks...

1586
01:21:56,536 --> 01:21:58,561
for catching the man
that killed my father.

1587
01:22:01,341 --> 01:22:03,400
I'm good at catching
the bad guys.

1588
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:06,903
Caught me a couple tonight.

1589
01:22:09,449 --> 01:22:12,577
Lot of people worked in this
squad room over the years.

1590
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:15,479
Lot of them have died.

1591
01:22:16,723 --> 01:22:19,089
Beau Felton got killed
in the line of duty.

1592
01:22:20,126 --> 01:22:22,356
Steve Crosetti
committed suicide.

1593
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:25,664
To this day,
nobody knows why.

1594
01:22:26,699 --> 01:22:27,893
Do you miss it?

1595
01:22:29,102 --> 01:22:30,467
Homicide?

1596
01:22:30,503 --> 01:22:32,471
I don't know.

1597
01:22:32,505 --> 01:22:34,473
It's not like you could
escape it, you know?

1598
01:22:36,242 --> 01:22:37,971
Death is every day.

1599
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:44,683
Death goes on...
and on and on and on...

1600
01:22:44,717 --> 01:22:46,412
And that's because
life...

1601
01:22:46,453 --> 01:22:48,785
goes on, and on.

1602
01:23:32,265 --> 01:23:33,357
Tina?

1603
01:23:37,403 --> 01:23:38,370
Hey, hey, hey.

1604
01:23:42,742 --> 01:23:43,902
G.

1605
01:23:43,943 --> 01:23:46,468
Felton?

1606
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:48,940
We've been waiting for you.

1607
01:23:48,982 --> 01:23:51,212
- Crosetti.
- Have a seat.

1608
01:23:51,251 --> 01:23:52,684
Okay.

1609
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:54,710
Jack of spades
for Mr. Beau Felton.

1610
01:23:54,754 --> 01:23:57,154
A 10 of diamonds
for my esteemed lieutenant.

1611
01:23:57,190 --> 01:24:00,353
And a whole lot of nothing
for the little Italian salami brain.

1612
01:24:01,995 --> 01:24:04,987
- What are we playing?
- Five card stud.

1613
01:24:05,031 --> 01:24:06,726
Who's the fourth chair for?

1614
01:24:08,268 --> 01:24:10,600
We don't know yet.

1615
01:24:10,637 --> 01:24:12,400
But they'll be here
sooner or later.

1616
01:24:12,438 --> 01:24:14,338
Anybody I know?

1617
01:24:14,374 --> 01:24:15,841
Maybe.

1618
01:24:15,875 --> 01:24:17,809
It's not like
it's written in stone.

1619
01:24:17,844 --> 01:24:20,312
It's not preordained,
or anything, Lieutenant.

1620
01:24:20,346 --> 01:24:22,371
I suddenly got worried.

1621
01:24:24,317 --> 01:24:26,182
My son.

1622
01:24:27,287 --> 01:24:29,983
He's a cop.

1623
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:31,047
I thought maybe--

1624
01:24:31,090 --> 01:24:33,217
I wouldn't worry,
Lieutenant.

1625
01:24:33,259 --> 01:24:35,819
Life is short.
And once you're dead...

1626
01:24:35,862 --> 01:24:39,559
you're a long time dead,
if you know what I mean.

1627
01:24:39,599 --> 01:24:41,032
Your son?

1628
01:24:41,067 --> 01:24:42,125
Michael.

1629
01:24:42,168 --> 01:24:44,693
- He's a good kid?
- Yes.

1630
01:24:44,737 --> 01:24:46,602
You taught him well?

1631
01:24:53,413 --> 01:24:54,607
I tried my best.

1632
01:24:56,849 --> 01:24:59,943
- I wish--
- G...

1633
01:24:59,986 --> 01:25:02,045
no regrets, huh?

1634
01:25:02,088 --> 01:25:04,147
You know what the best thing
about this place is?

1635
01:25:06,259 --> 01:25:08,989
All the worries and cares
that you had in life...

1636
01:25:11,297 --> 01:25:12,662
They don't matter anymore.

1637
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:16,500
''Rest in peace''...

1638
01:25:16,536 --> 01:25:18,094
means what it says.

1639
01:25:19,339 --> 01:25:21,739
Lieutenant, do you want
a cup of coffee?

1640
01:25:23,309 --> 01:25:24,833
Coffee.

1641
01:25:26,646 --> 01:25:28,375
Coffee would be good.

1642
01:25:29,315 --> 01:25:32,148
- Do you have any espresso?
- No espresso.

1643
01:25:32,185 --> 01:25:33,743
Where do you think
you are, heaven? Sit!

1644
01:25:34,921 --> 01:25:37,185
- $20 to you, G.
- I'm in.

1645
01:25:37,223 --> 01:25:39,953
Okay, we got one more card
coming up here.

1646
01:25:39,993 --> 01:25:41,585
We have another card there.

1647
01:25:43,696 --> 01:25:52,229
Who am I to need you
when I'm down?

1648
01:25:54,707 --> 01:26:04,082
And where are you,
when I need you around?

1649
01:26:04,117 --> 01:26:09,020
Your life
is not your own

1650
01:26:09,055 --> 01:26:14,493
Who am I?

1651
01:26:14,527 --> 01:26:20,397
Who am I?

1652
01:26:20,433 --> 01:26:25,962
Who am I?

1653
01:26:26,005 --> 01:26:32,069
Who am I?
