yeah, yeah, yeah #

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,760
# All right #

13
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,200
Shit.

14
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,080
- Hey.
- Hi.

15
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,960
I'm, uh, Adam.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,440
That must make me Eve.

17
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,800
- No, seriously.
- I'm being serious.

18
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,760
You're beautiful.

19
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,000
You're blocking traffic.

20
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,000
Hey, asshole! Come on!

21
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,320
# That's the way I like it #

22
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,760
Yo! Come on!

23
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,560
# That's the way I like it,
that's the way I like it #

24
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,280
# Yeah, yeah, yeah #

25
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,240
Hey, how's it going?

26
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,400
It took you long enough.

27
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,720
Uh, it'll be 11.58, please.

28
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,960
Mmm. Pepperoni.

29
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,840
Mmm. Jil Sander.

30
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,400
Impressive.

31
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,000
- Here's 12. Keep the change.
- OK.

32
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,800
And it better not be cold.

33
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,320
You're still beautiful.

34
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,400
Heh. Thank you.

35
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,800
You know what?

36
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,200
I think I forgot
to get your number.

37
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,680
# Indifferent... #

38
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,800
# I'm in the mood to make #

39
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,920
# Several mistakes in a row... #

40
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,480
# Mmm, mmm, mmm #

41
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,920
Cute hat.

42
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,880
# I'm in the mood to make #

43
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,680
# Several mistakes in a row #

44
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,600
Please tell me you did not
just give your number...

45
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,240
to the pizza guy.

46
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,000
Yeah, I did.

47
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,560
Why did I join a sorority again?

48
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,280
I got it.

49
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,120
Hey.

50
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,840
What are you doing right now?

51
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,640
Nothing.

52
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,640
# It was never the plan #

53
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,640
# To just up and leave #

54
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,520
# You know I've tried
to understand #

55
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,440
# Now it's out of my hands #

56
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,640
# And the months just creep #

57
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,440
# Now I'm just another man #

58
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,720
# Come the fall #

59
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,560
# I will remember you #

60
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,160
# Though you'll be gone
November #

61
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,600
# Come May,
I'll still remember you #

62
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,880
# Come what falls #

63
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,680
# I will remember you #

64
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,840
# Though you'll be gone
forever #

65
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,680
# I will remember #

66
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,200
Thank you. Thank you.

67
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,840
Not bad for a delivery boy.

68
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,360
Thanks... I guess.

69
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,720
Chicks dig guitar, right?

70
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,840
That's what they say.

71
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,200
Heh heh.

72
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,200
For real, you were very good.

73
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,080
I'll take that.

74
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,400
Who was the last song about?

75
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,640
It was really sad.

76
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,240
My mother.

77
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,440
She died when I was 12.

78
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,200
Oh, I'm sorry.

79
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,280
That must've been really hard.

80
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,640
Yeah, it was.

81
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,240
We were close.

82
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,760
Heh. Anyways, I'm sorry
to get all dark on you.

83
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,320
It's all right. I like dark.

84
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,800
You do?

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,840
"Tick tock"?

86
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,960
Life's not slowing down
for anybody.

87
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,280
What about you?

88
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,480
What about me?

89
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,760
Do you have any dreams?

90
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,920
Yeah, I do.

91
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,400
Whoa. Sports photographer.

92
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,640
Only by default. I wanted
to be a football player...

93
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,240
until the boys I grew up with...

94
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,360
started playing tackle
instead of touch.

95
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,880
Too tough for you?

96
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,520
No. Just when I broke
my collarbone...

97
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,960
my parents made me stop.

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,200
Some guy actually hit you?

99
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,680
Oh, yeah. I went up
to make the grab...

100
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,720
dude blindsided me.

101
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,800
Tough girl. I like that.

102
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,680
I've been infatuated
with athletes ever since.

103
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,920
Where have you been hiding?

104
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,560
Where have you been looking?

105
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,560
Will you go out with me again?

106
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,320
Oh. You are in big trouble.

107
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,840
# Just a box
full of photographs #

108
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,360
# Maybe a hundred or more #

109
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,840
# Here's the one
from the photo machine #

110
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,160
# At the five and ten cent
store... #

111
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,280
Hold on. Wait a sec.

112
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,440
I have something to tell you.

113
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,720
What's that?

114
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,080
I've never...

115
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,360
been with anyone before.

116
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,360
Huh?

117
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,080
I'm a virgin.

118
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,200
Heh. That's funny.

119
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,120
You are?

120
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,240
Yeah. Is that hard to believe?

121
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,080
No, I mean, it's, uh...

122
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,120
I didn't know virgins
existed anymore.

123
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,600
Yeah. We're making a comeback.

124
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,080
Great.

125
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,200
# I remember the rain #

126
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,120
# We were soaked to the bone #

127
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,880
# And I hoped
with all my heart #

128
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,640
# You'd take my hand
and walk me home #

129
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,280
# Then we went
to the corner... #

130
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,880
Heh. No.

131
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,200
# You looked at me #

132
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,360
# I smiled a smile... #

133
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,400
- Is it a religious thing?
- No.

134
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,400
Are you waiting
till you get married?

135
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,400
Not necessarily.

136
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,920
Then what is it?

137
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,480
Look, it is what it is.
Can you deal with that?

138
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,680
Yeah. Of course.

139
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,360
Good, 'cause, you know,
I kind of like you.

140
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,520
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

141
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,480
Ha ha ha ha! Whoo!

142
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,200
# Round and round
with love's little dances #

143
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,760
# Round and round we go... #

144
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,480
Mm-mmm.

145
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,400
No.

146
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,120
# Love's little dances #

147
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,840
- Come on!
- Go! Go! Go!

148
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,320
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

149
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,320
# Took me in your arms,
and we danced all night #

150
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,840
# As if no one else could see #

151
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,400
# I never counted on a dream #

152
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,000
I guess I was wondering...

153
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,120
what kind of time frame
we're looking at.

154
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,320
Why?

155
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,960
Do you see it happening
anytime soon?

156
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,240
And if I don't?

157
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,600
It doesn't matter.

158
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,120
Are you sure?

159
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,280
Yeah. I'm just happy
to be the guy...

160
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,560
that gets to go home
with you every night.

161
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,960
Shh!

162
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,520
- Shh!
- Shh!

163
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,800
- Ha ha ha!
- Stupid.

164
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,040
# Round and round we go #

165
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,760
# Cross your fingers
and take your chances #

166
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,080
# That's all romance is #

167
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,280
Ohh!

168
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,240
# Love's little dances... #

169
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,400
Ooh, that looks painful.

170
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,920
You're getting drilled here.

171
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,200
- Ha!
- Yep.

172
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,080
What's up?

173
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,200
Ha ha ha!

174
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,440
Enough with the picture stuff.

175
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,800
Ha ha ha!

176
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,320
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

177
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,120
I want this to be perfect.

178
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,360
Heh.

179
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,760
Yes.

180
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,280
# I love you
more than I should #

181
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,600
# So much more than is good #

182
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,280
# For me #

183
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,640
# More than is good #

184
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,000
# Ohh... #

185
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,880
Mm.

186
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,600
What is it?

187
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,160
I'm not ready.

188
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,200
I thought you said you wanted
everything to be perfect.

189
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,600
# More than I should #

190
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,760
Mmm.

191
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,320
I like laying here with you.

192
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,720
This is great.

193
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,040
# I am falling #

194
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,760
Adam?

195
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,240
Yeah.

196
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,040
Thanks for being so wonderful.

197
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,240
# And I'll lie
in the sound... #

198
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,760
I had a great time last night.

199
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,920
Yeah.

200
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,160
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

201
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,000
OK, well...

202
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,800
I'll, um, I'll call you later.

203
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,600
- All right.
- OK.

204
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,320
Let me in!

205
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,040
Oh!

206
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,680
Uhh!

207
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,960
# Oh, I'm sick and tired #

208
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,560
# Of living this life #

209
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,720
- Freddie!
- Yeah.

210
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,480
Let me in, asshole!
Open the window!

211
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,720
Ohh.

212
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,320
Come on, let me in, man.

213
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,760
Uhh.

214
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,600
What's wrong with you?

215
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,600
I can barely walk, man.

216
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,120
Still nothin', huh?

217
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,520
I used to think
blue balls were a myth.

218
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,680
Uhh! Ahh.

219
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,360
I feel like
the goddamn poster boy.

220
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,160
I don't know how
you put up with it.

221
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,640
I would've set that shit straight
a long time ago, my friend.

222
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,800
Is it really asking so much
for my girlfriend...

223
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,160
to get me off sometimes?

224
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
I mean, I have needs,
too, right?

225
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,280
Hold up. Are you saying
she doesn't even blow you?

226
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,920
Yeah. Heh.

227
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,440
She jerks you off,
though, right?

228
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,000
Jesus Christ, man.

229
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,680
What are you still
doing with her?

230
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,080
Uhh.

231
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,040
I, uh, wanted to...

232
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,520
check out one of...
one of your songs.

233
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,800
- So you throw it in the trash?
- My bad. My bad.

234
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,760
It's good shit, though.

235
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,960
I like the, uh, part you say,
uh, over and over.

236
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,400
- The chorus?
- Yeah. Yeah.

237
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,160
# When you let me go #

238
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,400
# A stronger love
I'll never know #

239
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,920
# And these will be
the good old days for me #

240
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,920
Uhh.

241
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,280
- Real classy, man.
- Aw...

242
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,160
Uhh! Oh...

243
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,600
# The days that
I'll look back upon #

244
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,200
# Endlessly #

245
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,640
Fu...

246
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,840
Look, you are only
in college once, OK?

247
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,680
She keeps fucking making you
leave early...

248
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,480
every time we go out.

249
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,000
You're missing out
on all the good stuff.

250
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,520
Heh. What'd I miss last night?

251
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,760
I don't recall.

252
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,040
But it must've been good...

253
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,000
'cause l... uhh... feel like
I got hit by a bus.

254
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,520
She's just...
she's so goddamn cute.

255
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,600
Where did we go last night?

256
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,000
No girl's good enough
to be with, man...

257
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,840
if she's not satisfying you.
Am I right?

258
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,480
You're preachin'
to the preacher, man.

259
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,440
I mean, shit, man, I might as well
just get a dog or something.

260
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,480
Dog food is cheaper than sushi.

261
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,680
But this is
our senior year, kid!

262
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,280
I can't be abstinent
my senior year!

263
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,160
Oh, don't even talk like that.

264
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,680
But if I didn't stick it out...

265
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,640
I'd always be wondering
what it could've been like.

266
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,360
No, you won't, man.
It's like my grandpa says...

267
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,560
"You stick a bag over their heads.
It's all the same."

268
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,640
Why do I always believe her
when she says this is different?

269
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,200
"I just want to be sure, Adam.

270
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,440
"I've never felt
this way before.

271
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,160
I'm scared."

272
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,680
Word for goddamn word, man.

273
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,000
It's all a game, my friend.

274
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,720
The more you play their bullshit,
the more you lose.

275
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,480
So, what are you saying, man,
I should cut my losses?

276
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,720
Sometimes it just
isn't meant to be.

277
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,000
I just don't know if I'm ready
to do that yet, Freddie.

278
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,440
I mean, I can't handle the thought
of seeing her with another guy.

279
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,800
Your girlfriend
doesn't even blow you!

280
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,760
That's death by stoning
in some countries.

281
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,240
How do you not just step up
and be, like, "Blow me"?

282
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,400
You can't just tell a virgin
to blow you!

283
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,280
God did. Heh. Besides...

284
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,840
she's not the Virgin Mary,
for Christ's sake.

285
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,600
Virgin!

286
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,600
What's he so pissed about?

287
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,920
Eve's still holding on
to her "V" card.

288
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,080
So? I thought that he loves her.

289
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,120
What's that got to do
with anything?

290
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,240
- Mmm.
- Ow!

291
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,520
Pig.

292
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,520
Think about it. They've been together
almost as long as we have.

293
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,480
You've got to give the guy credit
for sticking around this long.

294
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,440
Sticking around?
He should want to be around...

295
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,000
not feel like he's being held
against his will.

296
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,000
If we weren't having sex,
you think we'd still be together?

297
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,120
I'm leaving.

298
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,400
If we weren't...
if we hadn't taken...

299
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,480
our relationship
to the next level...

300
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,120
we would just be going
through the motions right now.

301
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,680
You really think that?

302
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,040
- She doesn't even blow him.
- Ouch.

303
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,120
How about I hold out on you
and see how you like it?

304
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,720
Hell, no.
Get that thing over here.

305
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,000
You're really talented, Eve.

306
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,520
Thanks.

307
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,280
You have an amazing eye.

308
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,680
Well, I appreciate that,
Professor Hastings.

309
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,160
Call me Dick.

310
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,440
No, I'd rather not.

311
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,680
# Now, I ain't tryin'
to wake up with you, ma #

312
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,960
# I'm just tryin' to
get out with you, man... #

313
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,160
I knew I should've
gone to Penn State.

314
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,200
# Why don't I rub that? #

315
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,000
# You know, man, cut that #

316
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,760
# Me and my ho squash #

317
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,320
# Yeah, let me touch that... #

318
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,040
Shit.

319
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,680
- Yeah?
- Hello.

320
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,720
Hey! What's up?

321
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,240
Are you mad at me?

322
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,880
Why would, uh...
why would I be mad?

323
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,240
You can tell me.

324
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,880
OK, so maybe I am
a little bit frustrated.

325
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,200
See? You have to be able...

326
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,520
Uh, one nonfat latte, right?

327
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,960
Hold on a sec.

328
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,520
Hey, did anybody ever tell you
you got a really great smile?

329
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,720
Thanks. Heh.

330
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,760
Eww, eww, eww.

331
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,400
Adam, we need to be able
to talk about these things.

332
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,000
There's no pressure, all right?

333
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,000
All I know is, I'd rather be
spending my time with you...

334
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,480
than with anybody else.

335
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,880
I mean, the sex stuff
is totally secondary.

336
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,720
See? That's why
I like you, Adam.

337
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,240
You're not a Neanderthal
like most guys.

338
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,160
Oh, are you going
to the job fair today?

339
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,120
No, they don't have a booth
for aspiring rock stars.

340
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,080
Can't hurt to have a fallback.

341
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,600
Fallbacks are for pussies.

342
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,520
Oh, Adam, hold on a sec.

343
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,320
Hi. Here you go.

344
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,120
Thank you. God bless.

345
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,680
Lord have mercy.

346
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,800
# Let me touch that,
oh, let me rub that #

347
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,760
# Damn, let me cut that #

348
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,040
# Oh, that ass is so thick #

349
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,000
# Chit #

350
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,360
Hey, Baker.

351
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,760
Wait a minute, Munch.

352
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,000
- What are you doing in there?
- Nothing, man.

353
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,760
You beating off in there?

354
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,320
Would you go away, please?!

355
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,720
Oh, yeah. Mmm. That's nice.

356
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,440
Yeah. Yeah.

357
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,760
Stick it in my big,
fat, hairy ass!

358
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,160
Ohh, man!

359
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,240
Do it to me, big boy!

360
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,200
Oh, yeah!

361
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,360
Ooh, you like that...

362
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,680
Thanks, asshole.

363
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,040
I won't be able to walk
all day now.

364
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,200
Man, she did it
to you again, huh?

365
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,440
Ohh, man.

366
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,360
This is getting to
be ridiculous, man.

367
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,120
I love Eve and all, but...

368
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,120
you beat off more than me
these days.

369
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,760
Are those the same underwear?
How many days in a row is that?

370
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,760
Five days.

371
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,680
No way, man.
That's at least a week.

372
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,440
I didn't wear any underwear
on Sunday.

373
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,080
You said "in a row."

374
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,680
You are a filthy slut, Munch.

375
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,520
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus, man!

376
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,880
You know, they say when your balls
smell worse than your butthole...

377
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,280
you should shower.

378
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,960
You gotta smell this, man.

379
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,440
Get out of here, man.

380
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,640
All right, you're missing out.

381
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,160
Now, can I continue
masturbating, please?

382
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,560
Yeah.

383
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,520
I'm telling you, Mandy...

384
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,080
there's just something
so exciting about doing it...

385
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,120
with your parents
right in the next room.

386
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,400
Eww! I can't even imagine.
Didn't you make noise?

387
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,960
No, he had his hand
over my mouth the whole time.

388
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,680
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha!

389
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,080
I could never. I'm a screamer.

390
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,480
Oh, well, see,
I'm more of a moaner, so...

391
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,680
- Hi, Eve.
- Hi, Eve.

392
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,040
Hi.

393
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,400
Were you not gonna say hi?

394
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,320
No, no, no. I was.

395
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,120
I'm just kind of
in a daze right now...

396
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,040
and the coffee
hasn't really kicked in yet.

397
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,960
Oh, well,
I was just telling Mandy...

398
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,760
how John came home with me
this last weekend...

399
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,760
and we did it in my old room
with my parents right next door.

400
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,040
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

401
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,200
No way!

402
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,880
Can you believe that?

403
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,920
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

404
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,920
Oh, my God, Eve. I'm so sorry.
I totally forgot.

405
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,440
Ohh. Oh, my God. I did, too.

406
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,080
Forgot what?

407
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,600
Well, that you're a...

408
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,040
you know, that you haven't...

409
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,440
Oh. That I'm a virgin?

410
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,640
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

411
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,840
Heh. It's not like
I have leprosy or something.

412
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,680
- Well...
- Heh. I know.

413
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,200
I just... you know, I wasn't sure
if it was a sore subject.

414
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,720
Oh, no, no. Not at all.

415
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,200
I don't understand it, Eve.

416
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,560
I mean, how do you stay sane?

417
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,960
Yeah, I mean, don't you want to?

418
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,320
Yeah, of course I want to.

419
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,600
So, why don't you?

420
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,600
Do you really want to hear this?

421
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,200
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

422
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,000
I believe in a love
so permanent and exclusive...

423
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,760
between a man and a woman...

424
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,920
that it motivates me
to keep my panties on...

425
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,320
even in the most
tempting situations.

426
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,960
Who wrote that, your mother?

427
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,400
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

428
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,000
Ha ha.

429
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,560
Don't you think that's
a little naive... Eve?

430
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,720
- Ha ha ha!
- Yeah! Ha ha ha!

431
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,720
Ha ha ha.

432
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,120
I guess I just don't know
what I'm missing.

433
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,640
- I guess not!
- I guess not!

434
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,680
Ha ha!

435
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,840
Ohh.

436
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,240
This is the all-new
Body by Jake ab scissor...

437
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,080
the four-minute ab machine.

438
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,280
If you want a slimmer,
trimmer waistline...

439
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,760
Forget those Girls Gone Wild.

440
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,760
These are Hot Girls Undercover.

441
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,960
Made you look!

442
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,840
# It's in the air #

443
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,400
# It's everywhere #

444
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,800
# It's in the air #

445
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,360
# Me so horny #

446
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,120
These girls are crazy.
There's nothing they won't do.

447
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,520
Anything you want, Adam.

448
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,040
# Me so horny #

449
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,680
Come and get me, big boy.

450
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
I'm barely legal.

451
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,400
We want Adam.

452
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,640
We want Adam! We want Adam!

453
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,360
Ohh.

454
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,560
Come in.

455
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,680
Oh, sorry. Busy?

456
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,480
Oh, hey. No, I'm just studying.

457
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,720
On a Saturday?

458
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,080
I know. I'm a total loser. Ha!

459
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,000
- Yeah, who isn't?
- What's up?

460
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,920
Um, ahem.
I have a confession to make.

461
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,880
Sounds juicy.

462
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,000
Actually,
it's more like an apology...

463
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,480
for judging you.

464
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,320
I know I don't, um,
know you that well...

465
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,640
but, for some reason,
I've, uh, always disliked you.

466
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,760
Thanks? Heh!

467
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,600
And I feel really
terrible about it.

468
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,600
I mean, I know
it's so close-minded of me...

469
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,760
and I would really like
to get to know you better.

470
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,000
I'm, like, a total bitch, huh?

471
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,200
- No. Ha ha!
- Ha ha!

472
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,800
No, not at all.

473
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,440
Come here. Sit down.

474
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,080
Um, it's actually
really weird...

475
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,880
because... I don't know.
I get that a lot.

476
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,160
You do?

477
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,880
Yeah. For some reason,
girls just don't seem to like me.

478
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,360
That's because
you're so gorgeous.

479
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,800
Oh, please.

480
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,520
Every girl in this house
is so gorgeous.

481
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,040
Yeah, but they're
threatened by you.

482
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,360
Ha ha!

483
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,120
It's a natural thing.
It's, like, Darwinism or something.

484
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,320
I guess it sucks
to be me, then. Ha ha.

485
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,960
I'm sure it doesn't suck
to be you.

486
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,840
Everything you do is so... great.

487
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,560
Like what?

488
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,560
Like the virginity thing.

489
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,760
No, l...
you don't mean that.

490
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,240
No, really. I mean...

491
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,480
heh.

492
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,080
I've had sex with three guys...

493
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,200
and every single one of them
broke my heart.

494
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,520
Oh. I'm sorry.

495
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,640
I think it takes a lot of strength
to do what you're doing.

496
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,280
Yeah, I know. Um...

497
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,640
sometimes I'm not so sure.

498
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,520
Huh huh huh huh huh.

499
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,840
- What's up, dude?
- What's up?

500
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,400
This smell like cheese or meat?

501
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,720
Oh, what is that?

502
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,440
It's my balls, dude.
That's my nuts.

503
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,760
That's not cool.

504
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,400
More, Billy! More!

505
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,080
Sounds like Billy's
splittin' the uprights.

506
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,120
More, Billy!

507
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,360
It's good!

508
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,600
Shut up.

509
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,000
Sounds like they're
sacrificing a goat in there.

510
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,760
Think about baseball!
It helps!

511
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,320
That-a-boy, Billy!

512
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,320
Get the fuck outta here,
moron!

513
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,560
More! More!

514
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,560
Uh, I wanted to know if I could
borrow some toilet paper.

515
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,680
Yeah, I really need some...

516
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,080
Get... the fuck...

517
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,440
ahh... out of here.

518
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,720
Ahh!

519
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,840
I hate your friends.

520
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,760
OK, you know what?
We'll come back later.

521
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,520
Yeah. Later...
we'll come back.

522
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,720
Fuckin' idiots.

523
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,160
It's all right, baby.
It's all right.

524
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,640
Did Patty smoke your pole
last night?

525
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,320
Nope.

526
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,360
I gave her the Heisman.

527
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,280
I'm pretty sure
she's got the, uh...

528
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,960
Itchy and Scratchy Show
goin' on down south.

529
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,680
I don't care
if she is disgusting, man.

530
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,160
I'd like to do my own
disgusting things to her.

531
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,600
She looks like she could
swallow a kielbasa...

532
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,960
- Ow!
- Jerks.

533
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,800
- Hello?
- Hi, sweetheart.

534
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,160
Hi. How are you?

535
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,520
- Hi, baby.
- Hi, Daddy.

536
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,880
- Everything all right?
- Mm-hmm. Everything's fine.

537
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,440
How's the boy?
He treating you like a princess?

538
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,600
Yes, Daddy.

539
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,880
You tell him if he doesn't,
I'll come break his legs.

540
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,360
I will be sure to pass that on.

541
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,600
We're still on for lunch, right?

542
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,720
Oh, yes, definitely.
I can't wait.

543
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,000
OK. Here's your mother.
Be good!

544
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,760
- He is so rude.
- You love it.

545
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,040
So, how are you, sweetie?

546
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,320
You sounded a little upset
on the answering machine.

547
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,360
I think it's really
starting to bother him...

548
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,760
that we haven't had sex.

549
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,320
- Is he pressuring you?
- No, not really.

550
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,320
Well, have you talked about it?

551
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,880
- Sort of.
- And?

552
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,640
I'm really confused, Mom.

553
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,800
What are you
confused about, honey?

554
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,240
I just... I don't know
why I'm doing this.

555
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,600
I mean, I can understand
why people think it's weird.

556
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,440
No, it most certainly
is not weird.

557
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,600
Weird is letting random boys
put their...

558
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,400
thingies in your thingy.

559
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,520
You did not just say
"thingies in your thingy".

560
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,480
Ha ha ha!

561
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,880
You know I hate saying
those words around you.

562
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,600
I really like him, Mom,
and I feel like...

563
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,560
I may not be giving
our relationship a chance.

564
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,520
Something worth having
is worth waiting for.

565
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,080
How did you know when
it was right for you and Dad?

566
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,120
When he told me he loved me.

567
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,560
Really?

568
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,080
Heh heh.

569
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,960
It was so hard for him.

570
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,320
It took him so long
to build up the courage.

571
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,200
And, um, then, one night,
we were just lying on the bed...

572
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,640
in his apartment,
and he said it.

573
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,040
How did you know he meant it?

574
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,240
He had tears in his eyes.

575
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,040
Oh, I would've paid big money
to see that.

576
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,320
After that,
we were like dogs in heat!

577
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,440
Oh, Harry!

578
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,640
We were practically attached
at the vortex of love!

579
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,800
Oh, my God!
I'm hanging up now!

580
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,680
Oh, honey. I'm sorry.

581
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,640
Mom, when am I gonna know
if I'm ready or not?

582
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,880
There's no right answer.

583
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,040
I was afraid you'd say that.

584
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,720
Just follow your heart,
sweetheart.

585
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,440
And that, too.

586
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,680
Jesus!

587
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,240
Jesus Christ!

588
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,400
Which one of you barn animals
did that?

589
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,600
- Did what?
- Go look.

590
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,480
Oh, man.

591
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,560
You got to be kidding me.

592
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,200
Munch?

593
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,680
It's not even my color, man.

594
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,640
Man, who was just in here?

595
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,680
- Ferguson.
- Ferguson.

596
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,400
You want me to do what, baby?

597
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,440
I could do that.

598
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,280
I could do that
all night, girl.

599
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,400
What?

600
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,960
What the hell?

601
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,120
Did you just come downstairs
and trim your pubes in our sink?

602
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,240
No.

603
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,800
Your eye is twitching...

604
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,360
punk.

605
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,600
I don't even know
what you're talking about!

606
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,400
You broke my goddamn door!

607
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,600
I brush my teeth in that sink.

608
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,520
I piss in that sink.

609
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,680
Don't laugh. It ain't funny.

610
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,640
OK, OK,
everyone pull out a pube.

611
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,000
What?

612
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,760
Don't make me do it for you, bitch.

613
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:24,000
I guarantee
I'll yank out more than one.

614
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,400
Dude, that's so gay.

615
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,160
Gray pubes, Munch?

616
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,080
Yeah. It... it's this thing.

617
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,600
It's... it's a condition.

618
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,840
It's really...
it's hard to explain.

619
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,320
This is such bullshit.

620
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,800
So I have short pubes.
That doesn't prove anything.

621
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,880
Aah! All right, all right!
I did it, I did it! Aah!

622
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,080
- Clean it up.
- I will!

623
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,800
Damn, dude! You know
I have a sensitive rectum!

624
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,400
Man, what kind of a bitch
trims their pubes?

625
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,200
I do. If you trim the bush,
the tree looks bigger.

626
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,560
- You do?
- Yeah.

627
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,840
- I do, too.
You guys kidding me?

628
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,240
I've trimmed.
You've never trimmed?

629
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,760
Hell, no, man.
You guys wax your chests also?

630
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,960
- Yeah.
- That's totally different.

631
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Frequent the tanning salons?

632
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,480
Whole other ballpark.

633
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,280
All right. Do you like it
when girls have a hairy bush?

634
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,560
I don't mind.

635
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,680
Yeah, but you like it
when they mow the lawn, right?

636
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,840
Yeah, I guess.

637
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,400
Well, don't you think you should
extend them the same courtesy?

638
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,520
I like women
that shave their legs.

639
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,760
Does that mean
I should shave mine?

640
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,240
I think you're upset because
you're in the minority here, Baker.

641
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,880
Well, I think real men like me
are a dying breed.

642
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,920
Trust me. If Eve ever
went down on you...

643
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,680
she'd like it
if you trimmed your bush.

644
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,920
Eat a dick, Ferguson.

645
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,840
She doesn't even go down on him?

646
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,280
- Uh-uh.
- Oh, my God.

647
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,640
What's her mouth for?

648
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,520
- Ha ha ha ha!
- Ha ha!

649
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,400
So, you nail Snow White yet?

650
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,600
- Nope.
- Jesus, man.

651
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,480
This girl's obviously
damaged goods.

652
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,480
Dad, take it easy, all right?

653
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,560
Hey, I'm not paying your tuition
so you can cuddle.

654
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,080
I need stories for my money.
Go... go have a threesome.

655
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,480
Screw a teacher. Do something.

656
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,200
I'll keep that in mind.

657
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,200
I'm telling you,
when you're fifty years old...

658
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,560
and you're jerking off...

659
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,440
you're going to need a lot of
different memories to call on.

660
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,760
That's disgusting.

661
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,040
She must be really
great looking.

662
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,440
Yeah, I mean... but you know what?
It's more than that.

663
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,040
What do you mean?

664
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,000
I want to be intimate
with this girl.

665
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,760
You know, not just for the sex.
It's like...

666
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,960
Is this you
coming out of the closet?

667
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,040
L... I want to get to know her.

668
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,200
I've told you this before.
Nobody...

669
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,640
- Nobody knows anybody.
- Exactly.

670
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,960
Well, no offense, Dad,
but a guy with three ex-wives...

671
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,760
isn't exactly the best
relationship role model.

672
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,720
- So don't listen to me.
- I'm trying not to.

673
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,000
All right, I'm just kidding.
I love you, son.

674
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Heh. OK, Dad.

675
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,560
Bye-bye.

676
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,160
Oh, my God. Do that ass thing
again you were doing.

677
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,200
# 'Cause baby,
you're like religion #

678
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,760
# I let you nail me down #

679
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:38,280
# I can't get my head around #

680
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,280
# The halo that's
shinin' around you #

681
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,920
# Who's to say
that the sky won't fall? #

682
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,680
# Who's to say that
the sun won't stall? #

683
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,000
# Who's to say
that the man won't call? #

684
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:59,000
# Who's to say
we can't have it all? #

685
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,360
Was that a hint?

686
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,680
No, it's just a song.

687
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,640
- It's good.
- Thank you.

688
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,120
Hey, Baker.

689
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,280
Yeah?

690
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,120
You ever think about
joining the army?

691
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,400
Yeah, man.

692
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,640
I mean, I guess the thought's
crossed my mind before.

693
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,800
I think it'd be easier
that way, you know?

694
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,240
At least that way you know exactly
where you're supposed to be...

695
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,720
what you're supposed
to be doing...

696
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,560
instead of constantly feeling...

697
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,080
like you should be doing
something else all the time.

698
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,920
Yeah, man, but, I mean...

699
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,280
you ever think about
the actually going to war part?

700
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,040
Yeah, but come on.

701
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:48,520
I mean, everything's
got a down side, right?

702
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,160
Munch, what are you doing, man?

703
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,320
Are you admiring your dump?

704
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,360
I'm wiping my ass.

705
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,080
What? Standing up?

706
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,400
Yeah.

707
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,600
You got to be kidding me, man.

708
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,760
- How do you wipe?
- Sitting down, bro.

709
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,600
Ha ha! Fucking unbelievable.

710
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,280
Sitting? How the hell
do you wipe sitting down?

711
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,440
How the hell do you wipe
sitting down?

712
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,960
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You stand, too, Billy?

713
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,120
Yeah.

714
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,120
This is unbelievable. Freddie?

715
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,880
- Sitting.
- Thank you.

716
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,000
I don't understand.
How do you wipe sitting down?

717
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,360
You put your hand in the bowl
with a turd swimming around in it?

718
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,000
No, man,
you do a little lean-off.

719
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,560
Come side door.

720
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,480
How the hell do you wipe
standing up?

721
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,240
I've never heard
of such a thing.

722
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,760
Ferguson, what about you?

723
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,000
- Sitter.
- That's ridiculous.

724
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,120
What, you're telling me
you turn and face the bowl?

725
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,160
Yeah.

726
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,120
You're telling me you guys don't
smear shit all over your ass?

727
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,160
Nah, you got to spread 'em.
You don't smear.

728
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,080
That's the whole thing is,
spread your cheeks.

729
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,680
Uhh. Aw, man.

730
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,560
Sitting, huh? I got to try that.

731
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,840
So, you go around the side,
but not up the middle.

732
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,720
Oh, yeah. The side door's
the only way, man.

733
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,720
Up the middle, you get your
balls and legs involved...

734
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,200
- and you don't want that.
- Interesting.

735
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,440
All right, all right.
It's good enough.

736
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,880
Let the games begin.

737
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,680
# Whoa, oh, oh #

738
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,320
# Whoa, oh, oh #

739
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,360
# Whoa, oh, oh #

740
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,200
# Whoa, oh, oh #

741
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:26,480
# I spent some time
with myself #

742
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,280
# Well, my head was on fire #

743
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,760
# 'Cause my picture's
on the shelf #

744
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,800
# All right, now #

745
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,720
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

746
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,920
I'm OK! I'm OK!

747
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,400
# There's nowhere to go,
oh, oh #

748
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:55,000
# When you find yourself
in a crowded room #

749
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,280
# Do you find your head... #

750
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,320
Hey, stud.

751
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,720
What's up, Patty?

752
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,600
Nothing. I just haven't
seen you around in a while.

753
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,680
- I been busy.
- With Eve?

754
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,880
Yes, with Eve.

755
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,280
Ooh, exciting.

756
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,480
You guys must have
some great pillow talk.

757
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,200
Fuck off, Patty.
You don't know shit.

758
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,800
Oh, did I hit a sore spot?

759
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,880
You done?

760
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,080
Mm-hmm. Just curious.

761
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,280
Why?

762
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,360
I like you, Adam.

763
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,520
I always thought you and me
should be friends.

764
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,960
How are we going to be
friends, Patty? Thank you.

765
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,080
Come on.

766
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,320
Don't tell me you never wonder.

767
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,640
About what?

768
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,760
About what it would be like...

769
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,200
to bend my legs behind my head
like a pretzel...

770
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,720
and then do whatever
you want with me.

771
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,040
Jesus Christ.

772
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,440
Hi.

773
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,320
Heh. Hey.

774
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,480
I'm going to go get
another beer.

775
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,480
You keep that in mind.

776
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,080
Hmm. Nice ruffles.

777
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,600
Excuse me.

778
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,800
Ahem. So, what were
you two talking about?

779
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,560
Pretzels. Um, Sarah, right?

780
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,560
Yeah. Ahem.

781
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,960
We were in the same
sociology class.

782
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,720
I'm surprised you knew that.
I only saw you there once.

783
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:21,840
Yeah, right. Anyways,
welcome to our shameful abode.

784
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,600
The keg's in there,
and have a good time.

785
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,960
- You need a beer?
- No, thanks.

786
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,720
# Well, if I take myself
into a room... #

787
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,640
So, I've been thinking
about the song you sang me.

788
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,880
What about it?

789
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,800
Well, obviously, you're trying
to tell me something.

790
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,960
Look, Adam, if you have
something to say, just say it.

791
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,160
It's just that
it's been nine months, Eve.

792
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,120
I mean, here I am thinking
everything's going great...

793
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,840
but you still don't trust me.

794
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,480
Yes, I do. I do.
I do trust you.

795
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,840
Then what is the problem?

796
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,440
Look, my virginity
is really important to me.

797
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,800
It's important to me, too, OK?

798
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:12,000
Adam, I have never felt closer
to anybody than I do to you.

799
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:17,360
Do you have any idea
how amazing it would be?

800
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,680
Hmm?

801
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,320
# And it feels so good,
don't hide #

802
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,520
See, that's what
I'm talking about.

803
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,800
You are so sweet.

804
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,840
- Say cheese.
- Get the fuck out!

805
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,480
Ha ha ha ha ha!

806
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,120
- Hello.
- Hi.

807
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,800
I find you strangely attractive.

808
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,240
Thanks?

809
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,360
Look...

810
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,640
# Wake up, wake up,
wake up, wake up #

811
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,320
# Wake up, up, up,
wake up #

812
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,920
# Wake up #

813
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,440
# I see your face
when I close my eyes #

814
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,640
# I hear your words,
and I realize #

815
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,800
# Wake up #

816
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,920
# And now I'm walking #

817
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,120
# Right beside you
on my own #

818
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,920
Let's get down
to the brass tacks.

819
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,120
I don't have time
to fuck around.

820
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,040
I like you.

821
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,440
Ha ha ha ha!

822
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,800
I like you a lot.

823
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,960
And if I'm not mistaken,
I think you like me. Ahem.

824
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,480
So, let's just cut the bullshit.

825
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,640
What do you say?

826
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,960
Why not?

827
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,600
# Wake up, up, up, wake up #

828
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,080
# Wake up #

829
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,160
# Wake up #

830
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,440
# Wake up, up, up, wake up #

831
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,840
# Wake up #

832
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,200
# Wake up #

833
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,280
# Wake up #

834
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,280
# And now I'm walking #

835
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,000
# Right beside you
on my own #

836
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,080
Get crazy! Go, man!

837
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,240
# I got a pocket
full of razor blades #

838
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,960
# So come on #

839
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,440
# Come on #

840
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,680
# Wake up #

841
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,640
# Wake up #

842
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,000
# Wake up, up, up, wake up #

843
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,640
# Wake up, up #

844
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,000
# Wake up #

845
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,880
# Wake up, up, up, wake up #

846
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,680
# Wake up #

847
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,520
- Oh!
- Ooh!

848
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,680
Aw, dude. Shit.

849
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,240
I think Munch just shit himself.

850
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,360
I did.

851
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,520
OK, and that was
my cue to leave.

852
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,640
Already?

853
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,880
Yes, honey. I got to study
for my midterms.

854
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,840
You have two weeks.

855
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,320
Yeah. Not everyone can cram
the night before like you do...

856
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,720
and get good grades.

857
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,960
Well, how do you know
if you don't try?

858
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,640
OK, yeah. Sarah, I'm leaving.

859
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,400
Are you coming?

860
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,760
Um, I think I'm going
to stay for a while.

861
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,840
Are you sure?

862
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,680
- She's sure.
- OK, good.

863
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,520
OK, I'll call you tomorrow.

864
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,560
Have fun with your friends.

865
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,200
What about my needs?

866
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,840
Oh, bye-bye, drunk boy.

867
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,320
Bye-bye, drunk boy.

868
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,520
- Ha ha ha ha!
- Heh.

869
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,760
Heh heh heh.

870
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:39,400
This whole town
is built on miles of hope.

871
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,960
Yeah. I dare you.
I dare anybody...

872
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,320
to give me one reason
why I should stay...

873
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,800
a guy like me.

874
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,640
Well, what's it mean, Munch?

875
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,000
It means...

876
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,600
that nobody has the answers...

877
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,880
not me, not you.

878
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,760
Not even you...

879
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,320
because there are no answers.

880
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,640
No... you know?

881
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,600
I mean, nobody knows
what's right or what's wrong...

882
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,400
because there is
no right or wrong...

883
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,640
only what's right for us.

884
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,320
Wow, Munch, that might
actually have been deep.

885
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,480
Come on. I like you, though.

886
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,000
# What my grandma done for me #

887
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,600
Baker dog. How goes it?

888
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,400
What's up, Vaughn?

889
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,680
- How's little Evie girl doing?
- Fine.

890
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,760
Yeah? You know, that's one hot
piece of ass you got there.

891
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,320
- You hit that shit yet?
- Watch your mouth, man.

892
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,920
I guess not. You must be taking
a lot of cold showers...

893
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,120
spending all your time
with that cock tease.

894
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,640
Whoa!
Touched a nerve there, didn't I?

895
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,480
Easy, fellas.
We're all brothers here.

896
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,960
Yeah, Baker.
Bros before hos, right, homey?

897
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,640
Yo, man, my bad. I'm sorry.

898
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,040
It's all right, playa. I un...

899
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,160
# Rosary #

900
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,440
Hey, man.

901
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,680
I'm going to draw a penis
on your forehead, OK, homey?

902
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,800
Cool. Keep it gangsta.

903
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,000
Vaughn's still out.

904
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,680
Uhh. I hate my life, Billy.

905
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,280
I hate my life, man.

906
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,800
You don't mean that.

907
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,440
You know, here I am...

908
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,640
with the most
unbelievable girl.

909
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,880
Thank you.

910
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,600
And I'm on the verge
of giving it up.

911
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,040
Why?

912
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,040
Because she won't let me put...

913
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,920
this excess piece of cartilage
between my legs...

914
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,880
inside of her.

915
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,640
It's, like, I'm some
sort of a caveman?

916
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,200
Well, that's because
you're a guy, man.

917
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,480
So what does that mean?

918
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,760
I'm supposed to have
no self-control?

919
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,120
You're being too hard
on yourself.

920
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,360
I mean, most guys wouldn't
even stick it out this long.

921
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,160
Give yourself some credit.

922
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,960
Well, I don't know, Billy.

923
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,640
Something's got to give, man.

924
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,280
I love Eve to death...

925
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,160
but this is
driving me up the wall.

926
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,720
- Have you brought that yet?
- Brought what?

927
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,360
I love you.

928
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,560
I love you.
That's what they want to hear.

929
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,960
Man, she knows I love her.

930
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,520
It may not be a bad idea
to bring it soon though.

931
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,720
I mean, besides, it's the truth.

932
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,800
You know what, Billy?

933
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,000
You're absolutely right.

934
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,720
I am?

935
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,160
You are absolutely right.

936
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,440
I am?

937
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,120
Ha! That's what
I have to do, man.

938
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:50,360
I mean, one shot. Let it go.
Full throttle romance.

939
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,560
- There you go, kid.
- No holds barred, man.

940
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,360
That's what
I'm talking about, baby.

941
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:59,040
If she doesn't go for it,
she leaves me no choice.

942
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,720
- You got to do it.
- That's it!

943
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,120
- Come on, man, give me a hug.
- Ahh.

944
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,160
- I love you, OK?
- I love you, too, man.

945
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,000
And I dare you...

946
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:11,440
I dare you to give me
one reason to stay.

947
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,440
There's no right for any of us.

948
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,600
There's only what's right
for each of us.

949
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,280
For both of us.

950
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,640
I like you so much.

951
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,640
# You say the rosary #

952
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,840
Munch?

953
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,880
- Ha ha.
- Heh.

954
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,000
Ha ha!

955
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,320
I'm OK!

956
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,840
# 'Cause, baby,
you're like religion #

957
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,800
# I let you nail me down #

958
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:54,840
# I can't get my head around #

959
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,920
# The halo that's shinin'
around you #

960
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,320
# Who's to say
that the sky won't fall? #

961
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:05,600
# Who's to say
that the sun won't stall? #

962
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,800
# Who's to say that
the man won't call? #

963
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:12,520
# Who's to say
we can't have it all? #

964
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
And you must be Eve.

965
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,720
Yes, it's me.

966
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,680
I see why a man would
go through all this trouble.

967
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:28,480
OK, I'm supposed
to read this to you.

968
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,920
"To my beautiful Eve.

969
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,880
"Roses are red.

970
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,280
Violets are violet, not blue."

971
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,400
Ha ha ha.

972
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,920
"But, you,
you are the thought...

973
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,920
"that touches my soul.

974
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:47,440
"You have become a part of me...
my favorite part."

975
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,520
Oh.

976
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,000
# I'm in the mood #

977
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,040
# To make several mistakes #

978
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,080
# In a row #

979
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,600
# On the floor #

980
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,160
# In the place #

981
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:07,760
# We met before #

982
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,080
# There is poetry in emptiness #

983
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,720
# That's why I always
turn to us #

984
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,720
# When I'm in the mood #

985
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:20,000
# To make several mistakes #

986
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,560
# In a row #

987
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:27,560
# Mmm, mmm, mmm #

988
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:33,600
# Mmm, mmm, mmm #

989
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,640
Oh, wow.

990
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,560
Happy Valentine's Day.

991
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,960
It's not Valentine's Day.

992
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,160
- It is now.
- Ha ha.

993
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:00,040
# Well, baby, I'm lonely, too #

994
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,680
# I got this 12-pack
of my favorite brew #

995
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,200
# I wanna stay with you #

996
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,520
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

997
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:11,480
# When the water breaks #

998
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,960
# No, you never seen
no sight like this #

999
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,360
# A sweetwater lake
with little golden fish #

1000
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,920
# And they swim right up to you #

1001
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,240
# They're not afraid of you #

1002
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,680
I love you, Eve.

1003
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,600
# Jesus wants the radio #

1004
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:33,200
# So he can keep track
of the Romeos #

1005
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,760
# In the world #

1006
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,280
# He's got a woman down here #

1007
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,200
# She's thinking of songs now #

1008
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:47,600
# That you just never hear #

1009
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:53,200
# She's thinking about
all those yesteryears #

1010
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,960
# When she was a good girl #

1011
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Uh-uh. No.

1012
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,080
You're kidding, right?

1013
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,800
No.

1014
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:07,400
Is that why you did all this?
So I would sleep with you?

1015
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,640
I thought we might actually
do something else...

1016
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,040
besides sleep for a change.

1017
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,680
Look, I can't just be ready...

1018
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,960
because you decided
to be romantic, Adam.

1019
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,240
That's not how it works.

1020
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,280
How does it work, Eve?

1021
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,240
You tell me. How does it work?

1022
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,720
If you were this frustrated,
you should've told me.

1023
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,440
Well, I'm telling you right now!
I am frustrated!

1024
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,240
I'm frustrated as hell!

1025
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,040
Yeah, I can see that.

1026
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,240
I mean, what is it? You have
no kind of physical desire...

1027
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,680
for me whatsoever?

1028
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,480
No.

1029
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,440
Uh, yes, yes, I do.

1030
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:45,040
This is like being in first fucking grade
with you, Eve, you know?

1031
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,920
I'm sorry.

1032
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,400
"I'm sorry."

1033
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,200
Well, I'm sick and tired
of your I'm sorrys.

1034
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,560
I thought maybe at some point
in our relationship...

1035
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,920
things would change...

1036
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,680
and you might actually
trust me a little bit.

1037
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,560
I do trust you.

1038
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,080
Then what are you
so damn afraid of, Eve?

1039
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,800
I don't know!

1040
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,360
I don't know.

1041
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,360
Unbelievable.

1042
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,560
God damn it!

1043
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,920
# Explosion #

1044
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:39,840
Get back, all right?
Get back, all right?

1045
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,000
Asshole.

1046
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,240
# Catch me on the wrong day #

1047
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,600
# I'm soul, I want
to see the real me #

1048
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,920
# Watch out now #

1049
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,800
# I'm sick of getting treated
like a stepchild #

1050
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,840
# Hurry up and roll, 'cause
I'm counting down to one #

1051
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,680
# Explosion #

1052
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,040
# Oh, yeah #

1053
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,040
# Explosion #

1054
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,800
# Whoa, oh, yeah #

1055
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,360
# Somebody save me #

1056
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,560
# From myself again #

1057
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,360
# The devil's cut my eye #

1058
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:38,360
# With his evil breath #

1059
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,160
# One more #

1060
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,920
# Sleepless night #

1061
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,920
# In Hollywood #

1062
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,800
# Where the stars shine bright #

1063
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,640
# So let me be loved #

1064
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,200
# Seduce me
with sins for free #

1065
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,240
Mmm...

1066
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,920
# If this is so bad #

1067
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,480
# Then why in the hell #

1068
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:21,400
# Does it feel so good to me? #

1069
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:39,280
# It's not because
you have a nice room #

1070
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:43,520
# Or because
you're a perfect ten #

1071
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:48,400
# It's not because
you're not doomed #

1072
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:53,400
# Or because I don't hate
all your friends #

1073
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,760
# But I will always love you #

1074
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,240
# I can't say that #

1075
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:06,280
# It's because you don't lie #

1076
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,320
Ow.

1077
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,120
# I will always love you #

1078
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,960
# But I can't say why #

1079
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,120
Shit.

1080
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,080
Shit! Shit, shit.

1081
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,440
What?

1082
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,840
Please tell me that...
that we didn't just...

1083
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,600
last night... we didn't...

1084
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,960
Like rock stars.

1085
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,480
Shit.

1086
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:36,240
Please. Like you haven't
been wanting this.

1087
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,560
Gotta go.

1088
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,840
What, suddenly you're shy?

1089
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:46,320
This was a big mistake.

1090
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,680
I don't make mistakes.

1091
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,920
- You gotta get dressed.
- Eat me.

1092
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,440
I'm gonna need my panties.

1093
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,240
Where are your panties?

1094
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,440
Well, you had to know
it was only a matter of time.

1095
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:10,240
Oh, God, shut up, Patty.

1096
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:13,520
Well, if you think about it,
it's her own fault...

1097
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,160
for not being able
to keep her man satisfied.

1098
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,000
- Listen.
- Hmm?

1099
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,080
If you tell anybody about this,
I swear to God...

1100
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,720
Yeah, right.

1101
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,600
And what are you gonna do?

1102
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:28,800
Please don't do this.
Please don't do this.

1103
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Relax.
I'm not gonna say anything.

1104
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,520
I got what I wanted.

1105
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,280
When you guys break up,
you know where to find me.

1106
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,640
I've been looking for a fuck buddy
who knows what he's doing.

1107
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,880
- See ya.
- Wait. Uh...

1108
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,080
one second.
Um, not the door.

1109
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,680
- Heh!
- One second.

1110
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,720
Yeah, right.

1111
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:07,760
Fuck.

1112
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,320
Pick up the hooker.

1113
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,560
Pick her up, kill her,
and take your money back.

1114
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,160
Thank you. I'm trying.

1115
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,800
# Me so horny #

1116
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:19,920
Later, boys.

1117
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,240
Who bumped Patty last night?

1118
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,520
Not me.

1119
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,000
Fuckin' Ferguson?

1120
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,880
Yeah, like Ferguson
ever gets laid.

1121
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,040
Fuck you, dude. It's a slump.

1122
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,760
It doesn't look like I did.

1123
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,120
Ha!

1124
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,400
Holy shit!

1125
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,800
- Tell me you wore a condom.
- Tell me you didn't.

1126
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,080
Tell me you ate her box.

1127
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,680
What did I do?

1128
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,080
- Ha ha ha.
- Ha ha ha.

1129
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,440
Please tell me you didn't.

1130
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,600
Don't judge a book
by its cover, Eve.

1131
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:06,600
I mean, Freddie may seem
strange and vulgar...

1132
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,120
but he is very in touch
with his feminine side.

1133
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,280
How so?

1134
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,320
Well, he writes poetry
and loves animals.

1135
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,800
- He told you that?
- Yeah.

1136
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,280
OK, I think he's
pulling your chain.

1137
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,480
OK, well, then,
how do you explain...

1138
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,440
the fact that he wears
women's underwear?

1139
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,600
Uh-uh.

1140
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,760
But I think it's sexy!

1141
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,680
- Bitch!
- You slut!

1142
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,240
Oh! Fucking whore!

1143
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,840
Get off me!

1144
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,160
You bitch!

1145
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,240
Ohh! No!

1146
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,080
- Oh!
- Ohh!

1147
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,960
Somebody get this
crazy bitch off me!

1148
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,040
Fucking slut!

1149
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,520
- Aah!
- Aah!

1150
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,760
Help me!

1151
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,240
Oh! Fucking... ahh!

1152
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:53,680
Ohh! I'm bleeding, you psycho!

1153
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,680
You scheming bitch!

1154
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,240
Oh, don't even try
to put it all on me, Cindy!

1155
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,840
You know he wanted it, too.

1156
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,040
You just wish you were me.

1157
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:04,520
That's what this comes down to,
you two-faced fucking whore!

1158
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:07,120
- Ohh!
- I hate you!

1159
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:10,200
I hate you, too!

1160
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,920
God, I've never seen anything
like that in person before.

1161
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,600
- I know how she feels.
- You do?

1162
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,520
When I found out
that Alex cheated on me...

1163
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:25,040
I was a total wreck.
I didn't leave my room...

1164
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,960
for, like, two weeks.

1165
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,400
Oh, my God. I just...
I can't imagine.

1166
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,040
I cannot imagine opening myself
up to someone like that...

1167
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,920
and then being betrayed
like that.

1168
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,400
Ha ha. You'd be surprised
what you could handle.

1169
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,920
Ohh, God.

1170
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,880
I don't know.

1171
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,120
You know, in a crazy sort of way,
I'm glad that it happened to me.

1172
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,480
- You are?
- Yeah, I mean...

1173
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:52,200
'cause you gotta get knocked down
to get back up, and all that.

1174
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,480
Yeah, I'd rather just
not get knocked down.

1175
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:00,600
If you could pull that off,
more power to you.

1176
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,680
You did the right thing, Baker.

1177
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,640
Who thinks Baker
did the right thing?

1178
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,120
See? It's anonymous.

1179
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,960
Unanimous, you dildo.

1180
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,200
- Why the name-calling?
- I have issues.

1181
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,000
Where are we eating?

1182
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,240
Taco...

1183
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:34,120
Ah, yes. Today is a good day
for diarrhea.

1184
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,200
Pffft!

1185
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,520
- What's wrong?
- I don't know, man.

1186
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,720
Suddenly, I gotta piss real bad.

1187
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,200
They have a good bathroom
at the T-Lair.

1188
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,520
I've grown many
a fine brown tail there.

1189
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,240
Four blocks away.

1190
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,760
Jeez, I don't know
if I can wait.

1191
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,160
- Are you serious?
- Holy shit!

1192
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,720
OK, OK. Hey, slow down!

1193
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,760
- Take the wheel! Take the wheel!
- Slow it down!

1194
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,040
Watch the fuckin' road, man!

1195
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,200
Hit the brakes!

1196
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,400
Brake, god damn it!

1197
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1198
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,960
Wait till the car fuckin' stops!

1199
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,400
Ah, for fuck's sakes!

1200
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,840
Uhh!

1201
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,760
Ahh!

1202
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,000
What the fuck?

1203
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,040
Ahh!

1204
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,640
For fuck's sake.

1205
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:15,960
Ohh, shit! Uhh!

1206
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,400
Jesus Christ!

1207
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,320
Aah!

1208
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,320
What the hell
is goin' on, Baker?

1209
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,960
I'm pissin' goddamn
razor blades, man!

1210
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,120
That's what's goin' on!

1211
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,520
- See, Munch?
- What?

1212
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:31,040
I told you, that bitch is dirty.

1213
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,400
What are you talkin' about?

1214
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,400
Ain't it obvious?
You caught something...

1215
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,520
from Patty the petri dish.

1216
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:38,240
Bullshit, bullshit.

1217
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,000
There's no way
it would show up this fast.

1218
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,080
Yeah, there's gotta be,
like, an incubation period.

1219
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,240
I'm telling you,
she has got diseases...

1220
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,440
they don't even have
foundations for yet.

1221
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,320
Don't you listen to him, Baker.
You can pee.

1222
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:50,720
- Ohh!
- Go for it.

1223
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:54,960
Oh, shit!

1224
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,440
Hello, officer.

1225
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,200
Nice day?

1226
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:00,560
Smart-ass.

1227
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:01,960
Ohh!

1228
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,160
- Baker?
- What?!

1229
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,960
Holy shit!

1230
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,040
I just don't understand
how a little pleasure...

1231
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,200
could be worth so much pain.

1232
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,240
Well, sometimes it's not...

1233
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:19,000
and sometimes it is.

1234
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,640
Sometimes it really is.

1235
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,120
Who's the best
you've ever been with?

1236
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:24,640
Alex... no question.

1237
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:27,160
He knew exactly where
I wanted to be touched.

1238
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,680
Where?

1239
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,920
Ohh. Everywhere.
I wanted his hands all over me...

1240
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,760
in my thighs, on my back...

1241
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:38,320
on my arms, my hair,
my neck, my hips.

1242
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:41,400
Ohh. It was amazing
every single time.

1243
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,600
Ha! Look at you.

1244
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:46,760
I mean, maybe not every time,
but most of the time.

1245
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:50,320
If it's with the right person,
it's the most amazing thing.

1246
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:55,360
You get to see a side of someone
that's... secret...

1247
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,320
that no one else gets to see.

1248
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:59,640
I like that.

1249
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,680
Wait a minute.

1250
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:06,200
Does this mean that
you've never had an orgasm?

1251
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:09,600
- Oh, my God.
- Well...

1252
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:11,640
I... think I have.

1253
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:14,880
I mean,
I've definitely felt things.

1254
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:17,640
Trust me, girl.
You would definitely know.

1255
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:20,360
I mean, it's amazing
little violent explosions...

1256
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,400
that are going on
all around your body.

1257
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,840
It's, like, unmistakable.
I just...

1258
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,840
I just can't believe
you haven't had one.

1259
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,240
Not even by accident?

1260
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,520
What? How do you have one
by accident?

1261
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:33,600
Like, let's say your hand
accidentally...

1262
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:34,920
slips down your panties.

1263
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,240
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha!

1264
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,400
Or let's say, like,
you accidentally...

1265
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,600
take out your vibrator
from your drawer.

1266
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:41,960
And you have a vibrator?

1267
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,640
Oh, no. But you could borrow it
if you want to.

1268
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:46,120
His name is Tyson.

1269
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,520
- Ah ha ha!
- Ha ha ha ha!

1270
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,520
No, thank you. I'll pass.

1271
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,200
Oh, man. I just...

1272
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,800
I don't know how you survive.

1273
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,040
Yes, Mr. Baker?

1274
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:58,480
Hi, Doc. Um...

1275
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:01,080
I'm sort of having this problem
with my... with my dick.

1276
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,560
- Your penis.
- Right, sorry. Penis.

1277
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,760
What's the problem?

1278
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:08,120
Um... l'm pissing razor blades.

1279
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,680
OK. Bring in
a cup of urine tomorrow.

1280
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,320
A full cup?

1281
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,920
A full cup would be best, yes.

1282
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,880
Oh, that might be a problem...

1283
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:20,960
'cause I'm only managing
a squirt at a time here.

1284
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:23,480
All right, then.

1285
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:24,880
Just do the best you can.

1286
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:27,320
Right. OK, thank you.

1287
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,160
You're welcome. Bye.

1288
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:37,360
Be strong, buddy.

1289
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,560
We're gonna get through this.

1290
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,360
Ohh! Ahh!

1291
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,480
The internet is so awesome.

1292
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:55,880
That's, uh, 17.73.

1293
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,600
Aah!

1294
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,440
Ferguson, I never knew
your mother was a dancer.

1295
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:01,600
Shut up, dick.
You know I got two dads.

1296
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,600
Oh, my God.
That's a lot of woman.

1297
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,000
Aah!

1298
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:13,160
Uh, I'm... I'm sorry.
These are... these are...

1299
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,520
I can't look away from this.

1300
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,320
I can't stop looking at it.

1301
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:19,440
You know, I find myself
strangely attracted to her.

1302
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,360
Ahh! Aah!

1303
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,560
Jesus Christ. Baker!
Did it fall off?

1304
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,320
Dude, they're... they're...
they're no good.

1305
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:30,960
These... these coupons...
they, uh, expired two years ago.

1306
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,120
Ha ha ha ha!

1307
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:35,840
Here, take this instead, man.
Take this.

1308
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,840
C-c-come on, man.

1309
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:41,280
It's the entire history
of Britain.

1310
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:44,520
- Ha ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha ha ha!

1311
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:47,320
Come on. I'm sorry, dude.
I'm just playing.

1312
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,120
I'm just fucking with you, dude.

1313
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,680
I did it.

1314
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,040
There he is.

1315
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:55,320
This guy just peed.

1316
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:56,960
Oh, my God...

1317
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,680
- Ha ha ha ha!
- Ohh!

1318
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,400
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1319
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:04,360
Oh, my God!

1320
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,480
That's it.

1321
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,640
Ha ha ha ha!

1322
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:11,760
Let me ask you this.

1323
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,040
If things didn't work out
between you guys...

1324
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:15,840
because you didn't have sex...

1325
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,440
could you see yourself
regretting it?

1326
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,080
Yeah, maybe.

1327
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:24,080
And if you slept with Adam
and things didn't work out...

1328
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,840
could you see yourself
regretting that?

1329
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,080
No, I don't think so.

1330
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:31,520
I mean, I feel
so comfortable with him...

1331
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,640
and I feel like he appreciates
things about me...

1332
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,720
that nobody else does.

1333
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,040
Well, you don't need me, girl.

1334
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,960
It looks like you got
your answer yourself.

1335
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,480
Heh.

1336
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,640
No, no, no.
You can't tell her.

1337
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,200
I have to.

1338
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:52,320
Don't take this the wrong way...

1339
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:58,120
Even if you do have something,
how's Eve gonna catch it?

1340
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,920
That's not the point, Billy?

1341
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,880
What is the point, then?

1342
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,400
Honesty.

1343
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:05,280
I fucked another girl, man.

1344
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,360
It happens. And when it does...

1345
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,360
you gotta be man enough
to live with the guilt.

1346
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,280
That's the sacrifice.

1347
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:14,200
And telling her...
that's the weak thing to do.

1348
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,000
I don't know.

1349
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:19,520
You're pissin' fire.

1350
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,920
Isn't that punishment enough?

1351
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,080
That's exactly my point.

1352
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:30,280
I mean, he was totally using her
to get to me anyway.

1353
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,360
So obviously.

1354
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:34,680
I mean, I don't even understand
what the big deal is.

1355
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,280
Adam.

1356
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,240
Hey, Mandy.

1357
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:40,200
Starting a little early today,
are we?

1358
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,480
You know me.
The party never stops.

1359
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:43,680
Right on.

1360
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:46,960
Well, I just finished
my last class of the day.

1361
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,480
Give me a sip.

1362
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:50,600
No, no, no.
You don't want this.

1363
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,760
Come on, don't be selfish.

1364
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,400
Give her a sip.

1365
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,480
You won't like this kind.
Trust me.

1366
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:58,080
I'll be the judge of that.

1367
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:00,680
OK.

1368
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:08,800
Is that a pale ale or something?

1369
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:10,920
- Yeah.
- It's Mexican.

1370
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,720
That's what I figured.

1371
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:15,600
A real beer connoisseur.

1372
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:16,800
See you guys later?

1373
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:19,120
- Take care.
- See you.

1374
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,880
Pfff! Ha ha! Shit.

1375
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:34,720
What?

1376
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:37,480
How would you like it if I sat here
playing the goddamn violin all day...

1377
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,160
while you were trying
to watch TV?

1378
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:42,600
As your friend, I would support
your creative impulses.

1379
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:43,960
Learn a song at least.

1380
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:53,600
Eve! I'm sorry.
You just missed him.

1381
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:57,440
I need you guys to do me
a really huge favor.

1382
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:58,720
Huge?

1383
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,280
I need you guys to take off.

1384
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,840
Ha ha! Hell, no.
Ricki Lake's on next.

1385
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:04,320
Please?

1386
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,880
Where are we supposed to go?

1387
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,480
Look, here's the keys to my car
and 20 bucks.

1388
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:11,080
I'm sure there's some bar
that has happy hour.

1389
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,840
A thousand bucks.

1390
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,680
25.

1391
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,120
40. Non-negotiable.

1392
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,160
- 30.
- Done.

1393
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:20,960
Wait. No. 30, and you have to
show us one of your boobs.

1394
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,440
Which one, right or left?

1395
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:23,720
Uh, I always liked the left one.

1396
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:25,400
Heh. You're stupid.

1397
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:29,440
I would've done it out of
the goodness of my heart, Eve.

1398
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:32,760
I would've done it
just for a look at your boobs.

1399
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,480
- Now?
- Yeah.

1400
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:38,280
Did you count the money?

1401
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,720
She's coming with me.

1402
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:42,160
That's it.

1403
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,840
Ahem.

1404
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,800
Have you ever cheated on Katie?

1405
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,720
- Me?
- Yeah.

1406
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:50,280
Of course not.

1407
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:53,280
OK, once.

1408
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,440
When?

1409
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:01,760
Uh... a couple of months ago
when I went home for Christmas.

1410
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:04,840
I saw, uh,
my old girlfriend at a party...

1411
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,440
and, you know,
I tapped that ass.

1412
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,480
Man, we are such assholes, dude.

1413
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:11,640
Yeah, I know.

1414
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,680
Mr. Baker? You're next.

1415
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,280
Knock 'em dead, kid.

1416
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:18,200
Have a seat up there
for me, please.

1417
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,720
So, uh... am I dying?

1418
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:26,320
Heh. Not as far as we can tell.

1419
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:28,880
But your urine test
came back inconclusive...

1420
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:32,800
so we want to run some more
tests just to make sure.

1421
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:35,120
Why don't you go ahead
and take off your pants?

1422
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:38,160
- Here?
- Please.

1423
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:42,120
With these things, we have
to be extremely careful...

1424
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:46,760
so what we're gonna do
is go ahead and take a culture.

1425
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,040
A culture?

1426
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:51,120
But, uh, my throat's not sore.

1427
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,800
Nobody's talking
about your throat.

1428
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,680
You mean...

1429
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:59,280
Take off your underpants,
Mr. Baker.

1430
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,880
You... you know what?
All of a sudden...

1431
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,560
I think I'm feeling
a whole lot better...

1432
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,120
Off.

1433
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:08,920
Jesus.

1434
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,960
Can't we talk about this,
please?

1435
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,040
Sit!

1436
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:20,080
This is totally unnecessary, OK?

1437
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,880
This is totally unnecessary!

1438
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:25,200
I'm sure if you just gave me
some aspirin or something...

1439
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,760
I'm begging you!
Wait, wait, wait...

1440
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,600
wait, wait, wait, please.

1441
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:31,840
Yes?

1442
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:33,200
Can I at least know your name?

1443
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,600
Layla.

1444
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:38,040
Nice name.

1445
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,960
Ow! Mommy!

1446
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,360
Jesus Christ!

1447
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,920
Hang in there, Adam!

1448
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:48,640
So, where were you from again?

1449
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,360
We'll call you
with the results.

1450
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,720
These pills should help
with the pain.

1451
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:58,480
They also turn your urine orange,
so don't be alarmed.

1452
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:04,120
Hey, just got your message.
You gotta make this quick.

1453
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:07,000
- I messed up, Dad.
- Messed up how?

1454
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,400
I screwed around.

1455
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:11,520
Great! My kid got laid.

1456
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:12,800
Was she hot?

1457
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:15,280
That's not what I need to hear
right now, Dad, OK?

1458
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:17,080
You're not thinking
about telling Eve, are you?

1459
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,680
- I have to!
- No, you don't.

1460
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:21,400
Dad, I think I caught something.

1461
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:22,800
What do you mean?

1462
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:26,040
I'm pissin' razor blades, Dad.
I got swabbed.

1463
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:30,760
Swabbed? Oh. Ohh, man.

1464
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:36,120
Listen, whatever you do,
don't tell her.

1465
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:39,720
Lie and deny, buddy.
It's the name of the game.

1466
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,200
They're ready for you,
Your Honor.

1467
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:47,400
Listen, I gotta go.
Proud of you, son.

1468
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,280
My robe?

1469
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:58,800
Hi.

1470
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:01,880
What's going on?

1471
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,200
Come here.

1472
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,440
- What?
- Come here.

1473
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:10,240
# All of my songs are for you #

1474
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:13,240
Just... let me talk, OK?

1475
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:14,840
- OK.
- OK.

1476
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:18,520
I've been doing a lot
of thinking about us...

1477
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:21,480
and I realize why
I haven't been ready.

1478
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:24,080
- You have?
- Mm-hmm.

1479
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,880
It's because I've been scared.

1480
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:30,600
Not of sex, but of intimacy...

1481
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:31,920
of feelings.

1482
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:35,600
That's what's always scared me.

1483
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:39,160
And I know that it's not right.

1484
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:44,880
And it's OK to open yourself up
to someone that you trust...

1485
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:47,600
and care about and love.

1486
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:50,200
What are you saying, Eve?

1487
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:53,760
Heh. What do you think
I'm saying?

1488
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:56,000
I'm saying I'm ready.

1489
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:59,640
I'm ready right now.

1490
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:02,840
Wait.

1491
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,960
Wait a second.

1492
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:10,800
What?

1493
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,320
I'm a little sick, that's all.

1494
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,320
What's wrong?

1495
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,560
I just came from the doctor's.

1496
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:17,720
Well, what did he say?

1497
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,160
Do you have the flu
or something?

1498
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:21,240
Heh. Yeah.

1499
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,720
No. I mean...
I don't know, Eve.

1500
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,640
It's... it's complicated.

1501
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:27,960
OK. Well, tell me.

1502
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,360
Heh.

1503
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:31,360
Something's wrong with my guy.

1504
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,680
Uh, he's a little
out of order right now.

1505
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,480
What?

1506
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,600
L... I know. It's really weird.

1507
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:39,120
I don't know what it is.

1508
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,720
Adam...

1509
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,160
what's going on?

1510
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,960
Nothing. I mean...

1511
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,200
Did something happen?

1512
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,800
What? No.
What could've happened?

1513
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,680
Did something happen
with someone else?

1514
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:56,400
Of course not, Eve!

1515
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:58,800
You know what? Whatever.

1516
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:01,240
I'm just getting
a really weird vibe here...

1517
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:04,720
and I feel like there's
something you're not telling me.

1518
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:08,160
Eve, it's just a penis cold
or something, OK? It's no big deal.

1519
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:09,480
Where are you going?

1520
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,520
I just don't feel comfortable
being here right now.

1521
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,120
Oh, come on, Eve. Don't go.

1522
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,520
Let's hang out for a little bit.

1523
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:18,200
Look, Adam, are you sure...

1524
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:20,880
there's nothing
you're not telling me?

1525
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:23,880
Yeah, I'm sure. Come on.

1526
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,400
You swear?

1527
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:28,000
Yes, I swear.

1528
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:31,560
OK. Um, no, I'll call you later.

1529
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,040
Shit.

1530
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:48,800
What happened, Adam?

1531
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:50,600
- Nothing.
- No. Who was it?

1532
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:51,840
Nobody.

1533
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:54,360
Be a man and tell me who it was!

1534
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:57,240
Patty.

1535
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:00,680
You fucking asshole!

1536
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:02,280
- I'm sorry, Eve.
- Sorry?!

1537
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:06,000
I trusted you!

1538
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:08,320
And you just lied
to my face like that?

1539
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:09,840
Who are you?!

1540
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,840
Who are you,
you fucking asshole?!

1541
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:16,200
- Eve...
- Get away from the door!

1542
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,840
Don't go.

1543
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:21,720
Do you know how hard it was
for me to get to this place...

1544
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:24,920
and then you just shatter it
like it's nothing?

1545
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,400
It's not nothing, Eve.

1546
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,160
Please don't go.
I'm begging you.

1547
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,280
Please.

1548
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,400
I trusted you.

1549
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,200
I trusted you...

1550
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:37,720
and you totally fucked that up.

1551
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:52,880
Hi, it's Eve. Leave a message
and I'll get back to you. Thanks.

1552
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,800
Hey, um... it's me.

1553
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:59,360
Look, I just want to say
I'm sorry, OK?

1554
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:02,960
Please give me a chance
to say I'm sorry.

1555
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,400
I hope that you're OK.

1556
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:13,680
Hello?

1557
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:15,360
Hello. Is this Adam Baker?

1558
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:16,480
Uh, yeah.

1559
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:18,720
This is Layla
from Dr. Bateman's office.

1560
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:22,200
I'm calling to let you know
your tests came back negative.

1561
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:23,880
The pain you were
experiencing...

1562
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,840
was likely just
a urinary tract infection...

1563
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:29,040
which is very common among
sexually active men your age.

1564
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:31,480
- Women, too, actually.
- Uh-huh.

1565
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,160
Anyway, I hope the pills
made the pain go away.

1566
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:35,320
They helped.

1567
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,240
In the future, try to urinate
after ejaculation...

1568
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:41,000
to get any excess semen
out of the urethra. OK?

1569
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,240
OK, I'll keep that in mind.

1570
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:45,000
Take care of yourself. Bye-bye.

1571
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:47,200
Thank you. Bye.

1572
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:51,640
# Watched the sun come up
this morning #

1573
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:58,040
# Big, winky,
shiny ball of fire... #

1574
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:22,400
The horrors of econ.

1575
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,360
What's up, Vaughn?

1576
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,360
- Macro?
- Yep.

1577
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,280
I took it last year. It's hell.

1578
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:29,520
Mmm.

1579
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:32,640
- Is Adam around?
- No.

1580
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:37,920
Mind if I sit?

1581
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:43,240
# Isn't it a shame? #

1582
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,600
# I feel like I've been
waitin' too long... #

1583
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,680
Ahh!

1584
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:50,400
Oh, shit.

1585
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:52,720
Baker, you're up.

1586
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:54,000
Hi, it's Eve.

1587
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:57,120
Leave a message, and I'll
get back to you. Thanks.

1588
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:58,600
Ahem. Eve...

1589
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,800
I just want to know...

1590
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:03,080
know that you're OK.

1591
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,480
God, I hope you're OK.

1592
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:08,960
Yeah, this bar's OK.

1593
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:13,160
I could probably get us
into a lot better place.

1594
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:16,360
I have a lot of connections
at a couple of bars downtown...

1595
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,440
you know,
where the celebrities hang out.

1596
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:22,080
I saw Dustin Diamond the other day
from Saved by the Bell.

1597
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:25,360
- Holy shit.
- Hey, hey, hey!

1598
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:26,640
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1599
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:28,960
Easy, easy, boys. Easy.

1600
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,480
Sh...

1601
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:32,720
Easy.

1602
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:34,320
- Come on.
- Chill, man.

1603
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:36,160
Just shake it, all right?

1604
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:38,160
What a lunatic.

1605
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,640
He's lucky he didn't
get his ass kicked.

1606
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:42,120
Shut up.

1607
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:47,520
# Let me have this one
to borrow #

1608
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:53,640
# It's all gonna
go down anyway #

1609
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:59,200
# Lord, let me have
this one tomorrow #

1610
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:01,040
Ha ha!

1611
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:06,520
# I used up all of yesterday #

1612
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:11,960
# Give me all the joys
and sorrows #

1613
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,800
I am frustrated!
I'm frustrated as hell!

1614
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:17,480
# Give me all that I can take #

1615
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,440
Tell me who it was.

1616
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:23,200
# Just let me have
this one tomorrow #

1617
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:24,840
Who are you?!
Who are you, you...

1618
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:30,200
# I used up
all of yesterday... #

1619
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:36,080
Baker, man, get up.

1620
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,760
I wanna die.

1621
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:40,160
Hey, hey, get out of here, man.

1622
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,240
Jesus, man, you stink bad.

1623
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,480
- Fuck you, man.
- You can't do this anymore.

1624
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:45,920
You smell like death!

1625
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:47,240
- Here we go.
- Get the...

1626
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,440
Oh, God, I can see his balls.

1627
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:50,520
Ohh!

1628
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:55,800
Lunatic!

1629
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:58,240
Get the hell off me, man!

1630
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:00,400
- Ahh!
- Shampoo, baby.

1631
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:01,720
I'm gonna kill you guys!

1632
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,160
It's for your own good.

1633
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,160
- Ha ha ha.
- Get off!

1634
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,280
That's a good doggy, yeah.

1635
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:09,200
It's for your own good.

1636
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:13,080
It's through! I got it, man!
Just leave me alone.

1637
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:14,360
Don't let it get in your eyes.

1638
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,280
That shit stings
like a motherfucker.

1639
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:22,280
Anyway, that's the last time
I ever set foot in a yoga class.

1640
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:23,920
Why would you go
to a yoga class?

1641
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:27,320
- Oh, my dads took me, so...
- Oh, your dads?

1642
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:31,360
# The freaks
around the streets #

1643
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,160
# Now, darling... #

1644
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,360
"Marketing executive".

1645
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,600
You sat around all day
and watched soap operas...

1646
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,000
and stuffed envelopes.

1647
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:41,480
You can't just say that,
douchebag.

1648
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:45,080
You gotta make up fancy
technical names for that.

1649
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,080
You... you can't lie
on your resume.

1650
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,720
Of course you can.
They expect you to bullshit.

1651
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:53,560
Resumes are about whose bullshit
looks best on paper. That's it.

1652
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,280
Did you lie
on your college application?

1653
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:57,640
Hell, yeah. I said I was
captain of the debate team.

1654
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:59,320
I said I worked with retards.

1655
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:01,560
Wait a minute. What if some guy
who works really hard...

1656
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:02,840
he deserves it more than you...

1657
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,320
he doesn't get in
because he was honest?

1658
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:08,840
You didn't lie
when you applied, Munch?

1659
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,560
No, my conscience is clear.

1660
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:11,960
How the hell did you
get in here, then?

1661
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:12,960
Yeah, Munch.

1662
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,760
Are you sure
you're even enrolled?

1663
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,840
I'm enrolled. I got in here
because I worked really hard...

1664
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:21,080
and kept my nose to the grindstone,
and I sucked off the dean.

1665
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:23,080
What's grindstone?

1666
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:27,440
# The world is blind, blind,
blind, blind, blind... #

1667
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:29,680
What's up, Miles?

1668
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,840
Hey, fellas.

1669
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:34,520
Miles, I didn't realize
you were so big-time.

1670
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:35,640
Yeah, you know.

1671
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:37,280
How's it going?

1672
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,840
Dude, it sucks. I hate my life.

1673
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:43,160
I work 90 hours a week...

1674
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:44,760
and it costs so much
to live in New York...

1675
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,000
I barely make rent.

1676
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:48,160
Don't sell out, fellas.
Take another road.

1677
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:51,240
Follow your dreams. Seriously.

1678
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,760
So, how's it going
over here, Miles?

1679
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:55,440
Oh, great. I was just telling them
about our benefits package.

1680
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:56,720
Sounds good.

1681
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:59,240
Best in the business.
We take care of our own.

1682
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:02,120
Take care of this?
Naked lady tie?

1683
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:03,240
- Ha ha ha.
- Ha ha ha ha.

1684
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:04,600
Naked lady tie.

1685
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:06,560
# Naked lady #

1686
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,360
# Naked lady #

1687
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:11,760
That was severely
depressing, fellas.

1688
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,600
How are you holdin' up?

1689
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:15,800
Fine.

1690
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,840
- Have you talked to her yet?
- Nope.

1691
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:20,800
Fuck her.
You don't need her, man.

1692
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:22,400
You got... you got us.

1693
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:24,160
That's right. Come on.
Group hug. Come on.

1694
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:26,840
- Ohh.
- Don't touch me.

1695
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:30,720
It's, uh,
beer pong time, gentlemen.

1696
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:33,400
- More like Patty time.
- Bite me.

1697
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:36,320
Hey, Adam, can I talk to you
for a second?

1698
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,000
I got nothin' to say, Patty.

1699
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:40,440
Please?

1700
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:42,240
We'll wait if you want us to.

1701
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:43,960
Nah, man. Just take off.

1702
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,400
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1703
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:46,560
Come on, let's go.

1704
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,680
"Bite me." That's kinda hot.

1705
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:53,080
So, I hear you're taking
this Eve thing pretty hard, huh?

1706
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:54,920
And?

1707
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,640
Just thought I ought to
tell you something.

1708
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,560
Tell me what, Patty?

1709
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,120
We didn't.

1710
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:07,680
Heh. We didn't what?

1711
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,720
Fuck.

1712
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:15,640
As drunk as you were,
you wouldn't go there.

1713
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:18,160
I was pissed, so I lied.

1714
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:22,520
It doesn't matter.

1715
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,520
How could it not?

1716
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:27,640
I messed up.

1717
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:30,800
How I messed up isn't important.

1718
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:32,320
Uhh.

1719
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,800
You're really in love with her,
aren't you?

1720
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,160
Heh.

1721
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,600
Hi, it's Eve.
Leave a message...

1722
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:51,240
and I'll get back to you.
Thanks.

1723
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,960
Hey, Eve. It's, um, it's Adam.

1724
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,720
Uh, you'll never guess
where I am.

1725
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:58,360
At a job fair.

1726
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:01,280
Um... followed your advice.

1727
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:05,680
Anyways, please just give me
a call back, all right?

1728
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:08,240
I love you. Bye.

1729
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:19,320
I just wanted everything
to be perfect.

1730
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,920
No relationship is perfect,
sweetheart.

1731
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,760
You and Mom are.

1732
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,040
Heh. Even we've got
our problems.

1733
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:29,000
- Like what?
- It's not important.

1734
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:31,360
Yes, it is to me, Dad.
Please tell me.

1735
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:39,880
It was, uh,
right before we got married.

1736
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,880
No.

1737
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,960
It was a mistake.

1738
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,040
It didn't mean anything.
It took a while...

1739
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:47,960
but eventually we got over it.

1740
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,200
My God, that is horrible!

1741
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:50,920
I can't believe you would
do something like that.

1742
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:53,840
It wasn't me.

1743
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,760
Mom would never.

1744
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,760
Look, the point I'm trying
to make is that...

1745
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,720
No! Mom would never!

1746
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:02,120
Calm down, Eve, please.

1747
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:03,480
Oh, my God!

1748
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,880
Shh. Take it easy, baby.

1749
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,400
No, I'm gonna kill her!

1750
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:08,880
That's not the issue here.

1751
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:10,960
- Yes, it is!
- Shh! Listen.

1752
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,800
I can't believe
she did that to you.

1753
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:16,280
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

1754
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:21,800
The point I'm trying to make is,
every relationship has problems.

1755
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,640
It's how you deal
with those problems...

1756
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:25,480
that's what makes it
or breaks it.

1757
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,440
I thought you said you were
gonna break his legs.

1758
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:32,200
I will if you want me to, baby.

1759
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,960
But it seems like this kid
really meant something to you.

1760
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:41,320
A lot of guys would've
slept with you first...

1761
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:42,640
and then told you.

1762
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:44,240
Or worse,
not even told you at all.

1763
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:50,920
So, you think I should
just forgive him?

1764
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:52,960
No.

1765
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,240
I can't tell you that.

1766
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:57,320
I'd say...

1767
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:01,040
let it simmer in your head
for a while.

1768
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:04,360
Then decide and don't look back.

1769
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:07,040
Oh, Dad.

1770
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:09,840
I just feel so bad.

1771
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:13,520
I mean, I can't eat,
I can't sleep.

1772
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:15,800
I miss him.

1773
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:19,680
I want to kill him,
but I miss him.

1774
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:23,120
And I'm just so mad at myself.

1775
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:26,200
It's OK to need someone,
sweetheart.

1776
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:30,320
It's OK.

1777
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:38,360
Hey.

1778
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:42,640
# I want to tell you
how I feel #

1779
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:45,320
# Heart and soul #

1780
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:46,600
Whoo! Ha ha ha!

1781
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:49,440
# I want to show you who I am #

1782
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:53,480
# Even when I lose control #

1783
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:56,520
# Paint a picture of me #

1784
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:59,280
# Of everything you can't see #

1785
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:03,920
# It's so hard to find a word #

1786
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:09,520
# I want to rock you
in my arms #

1787
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,840
# Endlessly #

1788
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:16,560
# Hold you in my heart #

1789
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:20,200
# Keep you close to me... #

1790
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:22,440
Please just go away!

1791
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:27,080
Listen, I said...

1792
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,000
Hi.

1793
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:49,560
I have these two feelings
inside me.

1794
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:52,000
Part of me wants to hate you...

1795
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:54,640
and never see you
or talk to you again.

1796
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:56,840
And the other part...

1797
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:00,680
the stronger part...

1798
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:02,840
wants you to take me
in your arms...

1799
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:05,480
and hold me
and tell me you love me.

1800
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:08,000
I do love you.

1801
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:15,600
And I need you.

1802
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:21,840
I need you, too.

1803
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:43,760
# Oh, I love you
more than I should #

1804
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:50,000
# So much more than is good #

1805
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:52,800
# For me #

1806
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:57,480
# More than is good #

1807
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:03,720
# I am falling #

1808
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:07,560
# Say my name #

1809
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:10,960
# And I'll lie #

1810
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,920
# In the sound #

1811
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:18,600
# What is love #

1812
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:22,040
# But whatever #

1813
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:28,160
# My heart needs around? #

1814
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:32,400
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

1815
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:34,520
Wait.

1816
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:35,920
What is it?

1817
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:37,640
I'm not ready yet.

1818
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:40,080
Heh. What?

1819
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,720
Can't we just cuddle
for a little bit?

1820
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:46,360
Heh heh heh heh.

1821
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:49,400
# Blue balls ain't no fun #

1822
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,400
# And I know #

1823
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:57,960
Hey, Baker.
