Would you like
to solve the equation?

00:02:01,756 --> 00:02:02,724
Charlie?

36
00:02:09,097 --> 00:02:09,998
Charlie!

37
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:14,502
I said, would you like to solve
the problem on the board?

38
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:17,437
I know it'll be easy for you,
considering all the "attention"

39
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:19,406
you're paying
to your class work.

40
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:42,295
Charlie!

41
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:44,331
This isn't even
the first incident.

42
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,334
She's been through a lot
with the divorce and all.

43
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:48,970
Maybe you could give her
a break?

44
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,740
Break from the rules isn't doing
her any favors, Mrs. Mitchell.

45
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,476
I realize that your home
situation has been difficult,

46
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:57,979
but I can't have students
thinking--

47
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,179
Can't have students thinking,
can we?

48
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,248
- What?
- Nothing.

49
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,017
I might have an idea

50
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:05,285
of where Charlotte gets some
of her attitude.

51
00:03:06,721 --> 00:03:07,822
Just so I understand,

52
00:03:07,922 --> 00:03:10,323
Charlie isn't being disruptive
to the other students?

53
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:11,759
Well, no...

54
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,094
And she turns in all
of her assignments on time?

55
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,062
She does.

56
00:03:14,162 --> 00:03:15,295
And she has an A
in the class?

57
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,364
That's not really the point.

58
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:20,034
She spends her time daydreaming
and

59
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:22,970
she doesn't apply
herself to her school work.

60
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:24,739
Seems like she might be bored.

61
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:26,206
Needs more of a challenge.

62
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,079
Fine. I'll talk to her.

63
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:32,580
Good.

64
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:36,918
I'm glad we could see eye
to eye on this.

65
00:03:37,018 --> 00:03:38,285
Me too.

66
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,455
And by the way,
isn't daydreaming

67
00:03:41,556 --> 00:03:44,224
what you're supposed to be
doing when you're a kid?

68
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,777
Charlotte Grace, you've got
to stop doing this.

69
00:04:02,877 --> 00:04:04,145
I can't keep leaving work.

70
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,646
You're going to get me fired.

71
00:04:07,749 --> 00:04:09,249
I saw that.

72
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,185
It's not fair.

73
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:12,887
Look, I know you're hurting.

74
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:15,723
But being angry all the time
isn't helping you.

75
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:17,091
Whatever.

76
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:19,160
It's not like you
would understand.

77
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,261
I miss how things used to be.

78
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,030
You know sometimes,
when I daydream,

79
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:24,132
I go to another place.

80
00:04:24,232 --> 00:04:26,234
I feel normal.

81
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,602
You are normal.

82
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:30,270
But you have
to pay attention in class.

83
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,540
But it's so boring.

84
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,576
Just learn to play the game
and stay out of trouble.

85
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,011
The game is dumb.

86
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:38,212
Sometimes.

87
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,380
But you're not gonna win
acting like this.

88
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,520
And watch the attitude,
okay?

89
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,955
- Sure thing.
- I'll get right on that.

90
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:16,083
Hey, kids.

91
00:05:16,184 --> 00:05:17,450
Hey, dad.

92
00:05:17,552 --> 00:05:18,853
Hi.

93
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,831
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Nobody gets through

94
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:30,998
without a hug and a kiss.

95
00:05:33,868 --> 00:05:35,236
Love you, Mikey.
Be good.

96
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,369
Love you, too.

97
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,471
Come on. I'm a little too old
for that.

98
00:05:38,573 --> 00:05:39,774
You're never too old for that.

99
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:40,975
Come over here.

100
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:44,011
Love you. Have fun.

101
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:51,786
You know, you can come to dinner
with us, Bitsy.

102
00:05:51,886 --> 00:05:53,321
Might confuse the kids.

103
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,856
And don't call me, "Bitsy".

104
00:05:54,956 --> 00:05:58,526
Oh, but you used to like it so
much when I called you that.

105
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:00,228
Come on, Troy.
We've been through this.

106
00:06:00,328 --> 00:06:01,229
It's time to move on.

107
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,332
God.

108
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,800
All right, Beth.

109
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,467
Look, I need you
to do me a favor.

110
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:09,170
I need you to pick up
the kids tomorrow.

111
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,204
You're serious?

112
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:11,339
I have to work late.

113
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,473
And you barely see them
as it is.

114
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:16,277
Well, I'm gonna get
to see them some.

115
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,046
You know, you can't just change
plans whenever the mood strikes.

116
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:21,381
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:22,750
Can't keep doing this to me.

118
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,187
Or to them. They need to know
they can depend on you.

119
00:06:26,287 --> 00:06:28,923
You know what?
I think you lost the right

120
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:32,392
to tell me what to do, Bitsy.

121
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,028
So, are you gonna pick 'em up?

122
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:38,132
- Yeah.
- Good.

123
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,600
Thanks.

124
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:58,152
Why you would wanna work
on a ranch is beyond me.

125
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,554
Oh, you know I'm sentimental.

126
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:02,890
Plus, that land's been
in my family for generations.

127
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,528
Sentimental ain't worth a dime,
man.

128
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:11,666
I don't know.

129
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:14,168
Some things are worth
holding on to.

130
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:31,018
You know what, man,
I love those kids.

131
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:31,986
I love them.

132
00:07:32,086 --> 00:07:34,355
You know, I would do anything
for them.

133
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,690
Anything!

134
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:37,758
Trust me.

135
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:39,093
Anything?

136
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:40,695
-What?
-You'd do anything for me?

137
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:41,796
Yeah.

138
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:42,930
Of course.

139
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,131
What do you want?
What do you want?

140
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:45,933
I want a horse.

141
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,535
Oh yeah. Yeah.

142
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:50,705
Wait. Uh, the little uh,
the little collectible...

143
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:52,773
What are those--
what are those called again?

144
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:53,908
No.

145
00:07:54,008 --> 00:07:55,443
I want a real live horse.

146
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,582
I didn't mean anything
that big, sweetheart.

147
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:03,184
You said anything.

148
00:08:03,284 --> 00:08:06,420
I can't pull something like
that together right now, honey.

149
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,955
- Maybe later.
- How much later?

150
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:10,224
-Later.
-What if I had my own money?

151
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:14,628
Where would you even put it?

152
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:15,896
Okay.

153
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:18,632
Say I found a way to buy it and
found somewhere to put it.

154
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:21,035
Please, it's all
I've ever wanted.

155
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,773
Well, I mean I guess.

156
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:28,609
I mean if you could do
all that,

157
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,478
then why the hell not?

158
00:08:30,578 --> 00:08:33,247
Really? You promise?

159
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,348
Yeah, sure. I promise.

160
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,518
I'm gonna get a horse!

161
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:42,590
You're gonna keep that promise?

162
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,125
Make this happen?

163
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:46,060
I don't know, dude.

164
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,095
She'll forget about it
in the morning, man.

165
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,630
She's just a kid.

166
00:08:51,432 --> 00:08:53,134
I don't think
it works like that.

167
00:08:53,234 --> 00:08:54,635
Not with a horse.

168
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:18,459
Why would he promise that
to Charlie?

169
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,660
Where is he anyway?

170
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,563
I uh, he fell asleep.

171
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,865
More like sleeping it off.

172
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:27,001
Yeah, I've just known him
for 20 years.

173
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:28,903
I'm not his keeper.

174
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:30,771
How am I gonna break the news
to Charlie?

175
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,575
But I could take her looking
for a horse just for kicks.

176
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:36,010
No need to go
to all that trouble.

177
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,413
It's not-- no trouble.

178
00:09:39,514 --> 00:09:41,816
Not to mention,
what if you find one?

179
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,718
Highly unlikely.

180
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:46,220
Worst-case scenario?

181
00:09:47,522 --> 00:09:49,924
Like I got a barn,
some pasture.

182
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:51,659
Be nice to have a little
activity around there again.

183
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,260
So, you're really gonna do this?

184
00:09:54,563 --> 00:09:56,831
If it's okay with you.

185
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:59,100
Seems like a shame
to break a promise.

186
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,202
Wasn't your promise.

187
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:02,303
No need for her to think

188
00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:04,071
that us men are going
to let her down.

189
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:05,439
Little late for that.

190
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,874
How's she ever gonna learn
to trust anybody

191
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:08,742
when she just keeps getting
disappointed?

192
00:10:10,144 --> 00:10:12,413
You're still talking
about Charlie?

193
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:20,788
You know, Beth, these bonfires

194
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:22,923
aren't the same
without you here.

195
00:10:55,557 --> 00:10:57,825
At the table.
No food in the living room.

196
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:02,531
That's right, Half Pint. Gotta
listen to those rules.

197
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:04,098
There's a place for rules.

198
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:05,332
Oh, I know.

199
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:07,201
Clean your room.
Do your homework.

200
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:08,402
Make good grades.

201
00:11:08,503 --> 00:11:09,703
Grades are important.

202
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:11,205
You wanna go to college, right?

203
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,341
Maybe. I don't know.

204
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:15,843
Don't mess with me, Charlie.

205
00:11:15,943 --> 00:11:17,845
You will study,
you will make good grades

206
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:19,146
and you will go to college.

207
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:22,449
That goes for you, too,
mister.

208
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:24,685
Hey, what'd I do?

209
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:26,220
Hey, what's that?

210
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,422
FMB.
Farmers Market Bulletin.

211
00:11:28,523 --> 00:11:29,690
Never heard of it.

212
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,991
Where'd you get that?

213
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:32,126
I subscribe.

214
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:33,127
Since when?

215
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:34,128
Since forever.

216
00:11:46,407 --> 00:11:47,542
Good morning!

217
00:11:47,642 --> 00:11:48,909
Mornin'!

218
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:52,112
You ready?

219
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:53,314
Hey, Max.

220
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:57,117
-Mornin', Beth.
-Mornin'.

221
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:03,090
Uh, I,
I guess we should roll.

222
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,491
Good luck, I think.

223
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:05,826
Well, at any rate, have fun.

224
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:07,294
Yes, ma'am. That's the plan.

225
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:12,066
Buckle up.

226
00:12:32,687 --> 00:12:34,522
Okay, I have a plan.

227
00:12:34,623 --> 00:12:37,358
A plan? Where'd you have the
time to come up with a plan?

228
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,425
Well, I read somewhere

229
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:41,795
that luck is when opportunity
meets preparation.

230
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:43,264
Hm, wise words.

231
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:46,267
Well,
this might be my lucky day.

232
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:49,671
True. What's your budget?

233
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,306
Uh, a little over $300.

234
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,075
Pretty tight.

235
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:58,279
Yeah. But my horse is out there
somewhere.

236
00:12:58,379 --> 00:12:59,346
Waiting for me.

237
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:48,362
Well, they say third time's
the charm, right?

238
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:49,363
-Yup.
-Okay.

239
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:51,700
Next one is right see
that driver right there?

240
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,233
Right there. Mmhmm.

241
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:08,082
Okay, last one.

242
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,553
Right over here on the left.

243
00:14:11,653 --> 00:14:13,187
Okay.

244
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:36,143
I really thought today
was gonna be my lucky day.

245
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:39,179
What would you even done
if you had found one?

246
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:41,649
Love it.

247
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:47,054
Quit playing.

248
00:14:59,701 --> 00:15:01,068
Wait, stop!

249
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:02,604
Did you see that horse?

250
00:15:02,704 --> 00:15:03,937
Stop.

251
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,351
Seriously,
she could spook easily.

252
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:19,721
So, you guys stay here.
I'm gonna get the wire cutter.

253
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:21,922
- Right.
- Right.

254
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,466
Whoa, take it easy.

255
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:33,668
Easy, easy.

256
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:36,571
Dang it, Charlie, I told you.

257
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:39,339
This could be dangerous.

258
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,913
Pretty scary.

259
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:46,413
It could have been.

260
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:49,416
Hi.

261
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:51,686
It's okay.

262
00:15:51,786 --> 00:15:52,986
You think you can hold him?

263
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:54,556
Yeah.

264
00:15:57,892 --> 00:15:59,092
I think he likes me.

265
00:15:59,193 --> 00:16:01,328
I think he does.

266
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:02,530
It's okay.

267
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,732
- It's okay, it's okay.
- It's okay.

268
00:16:08,503 --> 00:16:09,436
It's okay.

269
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:13,106
It's one lucky horse.

270
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:14,441
A little salve on those
scratches

271
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:15,710
and he's gonna be fine.

272
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:19,647
So, what do we do now?

273
00:16:20,782 --> 00:16:22,049
How should I know?

274
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:23,551
Well, you're the grown-up.

275
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:29,022
Well, he's banded
and that's the lead line.

276
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,626
So,
he probably lives around here.

277
00:16:31,726 --> 00:16:33,360
We just need to find the owner.

278
00:16:34,762 --> 00:16:36,396
He wouldn't run away
if he was happy.

279
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:38,999
They probably just left
the gate open.

280
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:41,536
We can't just take him.

281
00:16:41,636 --> 00:16:43,705
We can't just leave him
on the side of the road.

282
00:16:43,805 --> 00:16:46,173
You told my mom the other night
that we could use your barn.

283
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:49,443
You heard that?

284
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:52,514
Dang it.

285
00:16:56,985 --> 00:16:58,252
Come on, boy.

286
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:00,622
Come on.

287
00:17:55,977 --> 00:17:57,344
We did it!

288
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:01,749
Isn't he beautiful?

289
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:04,719
Beautiful isn't exactly the
word
that comes to mind.

290
00:18:06,888 --> 00:18:08,288
So, what's the deal?

291
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,960
It's a long story.

292
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,093
I've got all night.

293
00:18:17,732 --> 00:18:20,267
I thought you said there wasn't
a chance this could happen.

294
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:22,904
- Here wasn't.
- Beg to differ.

295
00:18:23,004 --> 00:18:24,572
-What are you gonna do?
-Me?

296
00:18:24,672 --> 00:18:26,040
Yes. You did this.

297
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:27,675
Wait a minute.

298
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:29,376
No. You're in this.

299
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:32,780
Well, I-- I meant what I said
about using my barn.

300
00:18:34,048 --> 00:18:35,315
Look, I'm not looking
for charity,

301
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:37,552
I'm just looking for a solution.

302
00:18:38,953 --> 00:18:40,888
Let him stay here for now.

303
00:18:40,989 --> 00:18:42,289
Someone's missing
something this big,

304
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:43,558
they're sure to miss it.

305
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:46,027
I don't know.

306
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,427
Let her have fun.

307
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:49,897
I just don't want her
to get attached and then

308
00:18:49,998 --> 00:18:51,498
get her heart broken.

309
00:18:53,735 --> 00:18:54,769
I know the feeling.

310
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:06,914
She's a natural with him.

311
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:10,417
I'm gonna name him Chango.

312
00:19:10,518 --> 00:19:12,319
Chango and Charlie,
that's cute.

313
00:19:13,855 --> 00:19:15,222
Honey, we're gonna
find his owner

314
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:16,824
and he's gonna have
to go home.

315
00:19:16,924 --> 00:19:18,126
You can't get too attached.

316
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:20,995
- Whatever.
- He still needs a name.

317
00:19:21,095 --> 00:19:22,295
That kid is so stubborn.

318
00:19:22,396 --> 00:19:24,832
Yeah.
Wonder where she gets that.

319
00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:26,934
-Hey!
-Oh!

320
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:29,302
Ha, ha. Easy, slugger.

321
00:19:29,403 --> 00:19:30,705
It's my pitching arm.

322
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:32,874
Is it?
Oh yeah.

323
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:35,743
So, Chango huh?

324
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:38,311
Not a bad name.

325
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:39,514
Let me show you something.

326
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:50,925
Whoa.
Is that you?

327
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,493
Well, long time ago.

328
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:55,129
No big deal.

329
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:56,463
Why'd you quit?

330
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:00,400
Took a bad spill.

331
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,369
Doctor said
I couldn't compete anymore.

332
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:05,139
That was my lucky hat.

333
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:06,808
Only wore it when I competed.

334
00:20:08,176 --> 00:20:09,510
Lucky hat.

335
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,377
Did it work?

336
00:20:10,477 --> 00:20:13,346
It did,
until it didn't.

337
00:20:14,982 --> 00:20:16,684
I've only ever ridden English.

338
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:18,052
I don't know Western.

339
00:20:18,152 --> 00:20:19,787
Can you teach me?

340
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:21,288
I reckon so.

341
00:20:22,657 --> 00:20:26,259
It's not as easy
changing what you know,

342
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:29,429
but want something bad enough,

343
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:31,933
it's worth working for.

344
00:20:33,134 --> 00:20:34,769
I want it.

345
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:35,937
Then let's do it.

346
00:20:43,211 --> 00:20:45,378
Maybe we should wait
a little while longer.

347
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:46,881
Or Clint should try him first.

348
00:20:46,981 --> 00:20:48,916
Mom, I trust him.

349
00:20:49,016 --> 00:20:50,551
And he trusts me.

350
00:20:50,651 --> 00:20:52,319
Chango wants me
to ride him first.

351
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,922
Tell you what,
I'll hold him,

352
00:20:56,224 --> 00:20:57,825
put your foot in the stirrup.

353
00:20:57,925 --> 00:20:59,259
Nice and slow.

354
00:21:00,762 --> 00:21:02,496
That's it.

355
00:21:02,597 --> 00:21:04,999
Now horses,
they like to mirror us.

356
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:06,701
You can't tell a lie.

357
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:10,638
So, if you're calm,
they're gonna be fine.

358
00:21:20,248 --> 00:21:21,916
That horse can take care
of her.

359
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:23,184
How do you know?

360
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,052
Trust me.

361
00:21:25,153 --> 00:21:26,654
Troy always says that.

362
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:30,825
I'm not Troy.

363
00:21:30,925 --> 00:21:33,594
I didn't lie to you back then,
and I'm not gonna start now.

364
00:21:33,694 --> 00:21:35,663
What do you mean,
lie to me then?

365
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:38,633
I'm just saying,

366
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:40,668
I've always been straightforward
with you.

367
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,838
I got a good feeling
about this pony.

368
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,252
So, how was it?

369
00:21:58,351 --> 00:21:59,654
Like amazing.

370
00:22:00,588 --> 00:22:02,590
Oh, you think that was cool,

371
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,926
wait til you try something
other than a jog.

372
00:22:05,026 --> 00:22:06,561
That horse has got some moves.

373
00:22:07,595 --> 00:22:09,831
Just remember, Charlie,
he isn't ours.

374
00:22:09,931 --> 00:22:13,333
We've notices all over town.
He could be gone any minute.

375
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:15,402
So, you keep telling me.

376
00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:20,842
You know, Beth, this horse could
be sticking around.

377
00:22:22,076 --> 00:22:23,678
I wouldn't count on it.

378
00:22:42,163 --> 00:22:45,132
Hey, heard you found a horse.

379
00:22:45,233 --> 00:22:48,135
I heard you found a nag.

380
00:22:48,236 --> 00:22:49,537
Where did you hear that?

381
00:22:49,637 --> 00:22:51,172
My dad works with Clint,

382
00:22:51,272 --> 00:22:53,174
I mean Mr. Holden.

383
00:22:53,274 --> 00:22:56,177
My groomer heard it
at the feed store.

384
00:22:56,277 --> 00:22:59,446
Great, everybody knows
everything around here.

385
00:22:59,547 --> 00:23:01,414
Come on, my yearbook class
is on your hallway.

386
00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:02,717
Walk with me and you can tell me
about this

387
00:23:02,817 --> 00:23:04,384
mystery horse.

388
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,954
You've got to be kidding me.

389
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,071
Atta girl.

390
00:23:24,171 --> 00:23:26,941
Still doesn't love the bit,
but he's getting used to it.

391
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:27,975
Hey.

392
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:30,443
Why doesn't he like it?

393
00:23:31,712 --> 00:23:33,581
See the scarring
around his mouth?

394
00:23:33,681 --> 00:23:36,083
It's from someone using
a hard bit and a heavy hand.

395
00:23:37,752 --> 00:23:39,987
Why would somebody do that?

396
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:41,122
Well,

397
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,025
some people think that
some horses

398
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:45,893
need a little bit more control,

399
00:23:47,128 --> 00:23:50,231
but you still gotta do it right.

400
00:23:50,331 --> 00:23:52,566
Can't just jerk 'em around.

401
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:55,169
And Chango's got a soft mouth.

402
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:56,938
Don't worry, boy.

403
00:23:57,038 --> 00:23:58,639
We're not gonna hurt you.

404
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,259
What do you think?

405
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:20,995
Ready to do something
a little faster?

406
00:24:21,095 --> 00:24:22,730
I thought you'd never ask.

407
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,632
Turn him around
and go the other way.

408
00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:33,240
I'm confused.

409
00:24:35,543 --> 00:24:36,844
A horse is all about feeling.

410
00:24:36,944 --> 00:24:38,546
They can feel a mosquito land
on their back

411
00:24:38,646 --> 00:24:40,781
in the middle of a wind storm.

412
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:42,984
I don't get it.

413
00:24:43,084 --> 00:24:44,118
Gentle in what you do.

414
00:24:44,218 --> 00:24:45,753
But firm in the way you do it.

415
00:24:47,822 --> 00:24:50,257
All right. Use your legs
to steer the horse.

416
00:24:57,398 --> 00:24:59,533
The pressure from your legs
to steer.

417
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,971
Gotta get your girl some boots.

418
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:06,207
Can't keep doing this
in her sneakers.

419
00:25:06,307 --> 00:25:07,641
Boots are expensive.

420
00:25:07,742 --> 00:25:10,111
And we don't know how long
we'll even have Chango.

421
00:25:10,211 --> 00:25:11,812
Or whatever his real name is.

422
00:25:13,381 --> 00:25:15,282
There are some good
consignment stores.

423
00:25:15,383 --> 00:25:17,151
Probably get a pair
really cheap.

424
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:19,954
This is about
to get out of hand.

425
00:25:21,222 --> 00:25:22,590
It already is.

426
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,859
I'm talking about Charlie.

427
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:26,927
Uh-huh.

428
00:25:27,028 --> 00:25:28,729
We've had
signs all over town and

429
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:30,865
still no response
from any of the flyers.

430
00:25:33,067 --> 00:25:35,836
You just start thinking about
a long-term plan.

431
00:25:35,936 --> 00:25:36,937
We.

432
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:38,172
We need a plan.

433
00:25:40,007 --> 00:25:42,910
You know, I got I lot of stuff
going on in my world

434
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:47,281
than keep trying to find a home
for a lost horse.

435
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:48,849
Like what?

436
00:25:50,351 --> 00:25:51,752
Let me show you.

437
00:26:11,772 --> 00:26:15,510
It's not much,
but I want you to see this.

438
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:17,878
This is a work in progress.
Okay?

439
00:26:17,978 --> 00:26:19,914
- Okay.
- All right.

440
00:26:23,284 --> 00:26:24,351
What is this?

441
00:26:24,452 --> 00:26:26,353
This is my workshop.

442
00:26:28,055 --> 00:26:31,125
I've dreamed that someday
I'm gonna open up a store

443
00:26:31,225 --> 00:26:35,229
and sell a bunch of furniture
that I make myself.

444
00:26:35,329 --> 00:26:36,630
It's a beautiful dream.

445
00:26:38,165 --> 00:26:40,701
That's not the most beautiful
thing in this room.

446
00:26:42,903 --> 00:26:45,739
I've always thought so since

447
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,741
the day we first met.

448
00:26:47,842 --> 00:26:49,643
You did?

449
00:26:49,743 --> 00:26:51,779
But you were so into
what's her name?

450
00:26:51,879 --> 00:26:53,747
-What?
-What was her name?

451
00:26:54,682 --> 00:26:56,417
Mandy, oh no.

452
00:26:56,518 --> 00:26:58,520
No, she-- she--
I mean she tried,

453
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:01,188
she was
a stage level five stalker.

454
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:03,390
But we never went out.

455
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:04,458
But Troy said that you
and her were...

456
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,760
Well, he lied.

457
00:27:08,028 --> 00:27:09,730
Why didn't you ever say
anything?

458
00:27:14,702 --> 00:27:17,238
'Cause Troy was my friend.

459
00:27:17,338 --> 00:27:18,973
And uh,

460
00:27:19,073 --> 00:27:20,674
but you guys--

461
00:27:20,774 --> 00:27:21,942
you guys started dating
right away.

462
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:25,079
And then you got married
and had kids.

463
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,781
Oh.

464
00:27:30,585 --> 00:27:32,953
I don't know if you--
you noticed, but uh,

465
00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:37,992
I've gotten very attached
to you and the kids.

466
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,729
I'm just not ready.

467
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:44,098
And like you said,
Troy is your friend.

468
00:27:46,367 --> 00:27:47,735
Yeah.

469
00:27:48,936 --> 00:27:52,773
He had his shot,
and he blew it.

470
00:27:54,775 --> 00:27:57,711
But if you're not ready,

471
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:00,814
I respect your wishes.

472
00:28:02,216 --> 00:28:03,717
Thank you.

473
00:28:05,753 --> 00:28:07,888
I'm hoping you'll have
a change of heart.

474
00:28:24,673 --> 00:28:26,106
How's it going
with your new horse?

475
00:28:27,576 --> 00:28:28,543
-What?
-I said,

476
00:28:28,643 --> 00:28:29,777
how's it going
with your new horse?

477
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:31,745
Oh, way better.

478
00:28:31,845 --> 00:28:33,781
We've been practicing like
every day now.

479
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:35,617
Have you heard about
the Junior Rodeo coming up?

480
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:36,984
The what?

481
00:28:37,084 --> 00:28:37,985
Oh, it's so fun.

482
00:28:38,085 --> 00:28:39,554
There's a bunch of events
but uh...

483
00:28:39,654 --> 00:28:40,821
I do the calf roping.

484
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:42,923
A lot of the girls
do the barrel racing though.

485
00:28:43,023 --> 00:28:45,527
I don't really know much
about that stuff.

486
00:28:45,627 --> 00:28:47,461
You can learn
if you start practicing.

487
00:28:47,562 --> 00:28:48,429
I mean I bet
Clint could teach you.

488
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:49,730
He used to rodeo.

489
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,533
Didn't you hear?

490
00:28:51,633 --> 00:28:52,800
She can't compete.

491
00:28:53,734 --> 00:28:55,670
She barely even knows how to
ride.

492
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:57,838
I didn't say that!

493
00:28:57,938 --> 00:28:59,473
Madison's just afraid
you'll beat her.

494
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:04,345
You wouldn't stand a chance.

495
00:29:04,445 --> 00:29:06,046
Maybe I should enter barrels.

496
00:29:06,146 --> 00:29:07,915
I mean, I don't have anything
to lose.

497
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,519
But somebody expecting to win?

498
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,053
They have everything to lose.

499
00:29:46,854 --> 00:29:48,623
We knocked it down
four times today.

500
00:29:48,723 --> 00:29:49,923
We're getting better.

501
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:07,808
Oh.

502
00:30:07,908 --> 00:30:09,577
Whoa, boy! Whoa!

503
00:30:15,517 --> 00:30:17,351
Am I in trouble?

504
00:30:17,451 --> 00:30:18,819
Hardly.

505
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:20,187
That wasn't half bad.

506
00:30:21,422 --> 00:30:22,724
A guy at my school said that
there's a

507
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:24,526
Junior Rodeo coming up.

508
00:30:24,626 --> 00:30:26,360
Can I enter?

509
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,929
I'd make a bet that that horse
has seen barrels before.

510
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:32,933
I could teach you to ride him,
if you like.

511
00:30:33,033 --> 00:30:35,002
That'd be awesome!

512
00:30:35,102 --> 00:30:37,204
With permission from your mom,
of course.

513
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:41,041
Of course.

514
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,477
I don't like it.

515
00:30:43,578 --> 00:30:44,612
It's dangerous.

516
00:30:44,713 --> 00:30:46,280
Mom. Come on, I'm not a baby.

517
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,716
You're my baby.

518
00:30:47,816 --> 00:30:49,617
Actually, it's a lot safer
than you think.

519
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:52,920
I could teach her how
to do it right.

520
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,154
And your school work.

521
00:30:54,254 --> 00:30:55,757
You already spend too much time
in the barn

522
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:57,358
and not enough time
in the books.

523
00:30:57,458 --> 00:30:59,059
Not to mention,
her dad will never let her.

524
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:01,061
- Yes, he will.
- Doubtful.

525
00:31:01,161 --> 00:31:02,831
Why do you always have
to pick on dad?

526
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:03,964
Charlie, if you only knew--

527
00:31:04,064 --> 00:31:06,233
Ask him to come out
and watch her ride.

528
00:31:07,935 --> 00:31:11,071
Fine. If your dad says yes,
you can do it.

529
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:13,273
But if I see any problems
with your school work,

530
00:31:13,374 --> 00:31:14,576
it's over.

531
00:31:18,912 --> 00:31:20,815
Glad you two are satisfied.

532
00:31:20,914 --> 00:31:22,116
Ask your dad to meet us
at the barn

533
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:23,618
when he comes to pick you up
on Friday.

534
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:33,427
You doing your homework?

535
00:31:33,528 --> 00:31:34,428
Yeah.

536
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:36,664
- Good girl.
- Don't stay up too late.

537
00:31:36,765 --> 00:31:38,332
Okay.

538
00:31:46,173 --> 00:31:48,075
You sure he's safe for Mikey?

539
00:31:48,175 --> 00:31:50,578
Oh, he takes care of his rider.

540
00:31:50,678 --> 00:31:52,547
He's a good horse.

541
00:31:52,647 --> 00:31:53,981
You're lucky to have him.

542
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:55,784
Well, he's not exactly ours.

543
00:31:55,884 --> 00:31:57,451
More like on temporary loan.

544
00:31:57,552 --> 00:31:59,486
And every day, Charlie falls
more in love with him.

545
00:32:00,889 --> 00:32:02,624
Maybe I need to find
something to distract her.

546
00:32:03,892 --> 00:32:05,660
-Like what?
-I don't know.

547
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,797
Sleepovers? Friends? Soccer?

548
00:32:08,897 --> 00:32:10,431
I hate to tell you, but

549
00:32:10,532 --> 00:32:12,634
a few sleepovers ain't gonna
cure what she's got.

550
00:32:12,734 --> 00:32:13,635
And what's that?

551
00:32:14,803 --> 00:32:15,936
The girl's horse crazy.

552
00:32:16,036 --> 00:32:17,539
Ain't no cure.

553
00:32:19,373 --> 00:32:20,407
This is cool.

554
00:32:20,508 --> 00:32:21,876
If you really like it
and you practice,

555
00:32:21,975 --> 00:32:23,343
you could do it
by yourself.

556
00:32:23,444 --> 00:32:24,712
Want me to teach you,
Mini-Mike?

557
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:28,248
Mom would never let me.

558
00:32:28,348 --> 00:32:30,518
We don't have to mention it
to mom.

559
00:32:30,618 --> 00:32:32,252
It'll be just me and you.

560
00:32:32,352 --> 00:32:33,353
Fun.

561
00:32:34,756 --> 00:32:35,790
Aren't you falling in love?

562
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:37,592
What?

563
00:32:37,692 --> 00:32:39,293
With the horse.

564
00:32:41,495 --> 00:32:42,963
Come on. Your turn.

565
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:52,105
I've never been on a horse
before.

566
00:32:52,206 --> 00:32:53,942
Trust me,
you're gonna love it.

567
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:55,510
You keep saying that.

568
00:32:57,244 --> 00:32:58,345
Oh, look

569
00:32:58,445 --> 00:33:00,380
I'll tell you,
you look good on a horse.

570
00:33:01,482 --> 00:33:02,684
Thank you.

571
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,891
Wow, Bitsy. I didn't know you
liked to ride.

572
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:12,426
You guys. How's it goin'?

573
00:33:12,527 --> 00:33:13,728
Good.

574
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:19,534
First time.

575
00:33:19,634 --> 00:33:23,136
Hey, it's uh-- it's great you
got my buddy there,

576
00:33:24,104 --> 00:33:25,907
giving you the ride around,
huh.

577
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:28,743
I was just-- just trying to help
out.

578
00:33:28,843 --> 00:33:30,879
Oh well.

579
00:33:30,979 --> 00:33:32,179
That's real nice of you, Clint,

580
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,516
looking out for my family
like that.

581
00:33:37,986 --> 00:33:39,453
Do you wanna see me ride?

582
00:33:39,554 --> 00:33:40,788
Of course, angel.

583
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:43,758
That's why I'm here,
isn't it?

584
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:53,735
So, no one's come to
claim it, huh?

585
00:33:53,835 --> 00:33:57,137
Nope. We put ads, and signs,
and flyers all over town.

586
00:33:57,237 --> 00:33:58,806
What else can you do?

587
00:33:58,907 --> 00:34:00,975
I don't know. Maybe uh,

588
00:34:01,074 --> 00:34:02,075
you shouldn't get too close
to something

589
00:34:02,175 --> 00:34:04,311
that doesn't belong to you.

590
00:34:04,411 --> 00:34:06,548
Someone's liable
to claim it.

591
00:34:06,648 --> 00:34:08,683
I'll take that
into consideration, Troy.

592
00:34:09,884 --> 00:34:11,184
Yeah, I'm sure you will.

593
00:34:12,787 --> 00:34:16,558
Anyway, I'm here to see if
my girl's a cowgirl.

594
00:34:17,825 --> 00:34:20,193
Giddy up.

595
00:34:55,697 --> 00:34:57,264
A good show.

596
00:34:57,364 --> 00:34:59,466
- So, can I enter the rodeo?
- Of course.

597
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:02,202
I'm gonna have front-row seats
to see my girl win.

598
00:35:02,302 --> 00:35:04,973
Well, I probably won't win,
but it will be fun to compete.

599
00:35:05,073 --> 00:35:05,974
No, no, no, no, no.

600
00:35:06,074 --> 00:35:07,508
You are gonna win.

601
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:08,743
Trust me.

602
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,553
Well, that was interesting.

603
00:35:20,822 --> 00:35:22,289
I don't blame the guy.

604
00:35:24,257 --> 00:35:26,159
It's getting late.

605
00:35:26,259 --> 00:35:27,962
Do you want some help
cleaning the barn?

606
00:35:28,062 --> 00:35:29,329
It'll go by faster.

607
00:35:31,198 --> 00:35:33,467
Now, why would I want it
to go by faster?

608
00:35:34,669 --> 00:35:37,839
So, you can get rid of me
and have some peace and quiet.

609
00:35:39,172 --> 00:35:40,307
Tell you what.

610
00:35:41,943 --> 00:35:44,746
Why don't you let me
make you dinner?

611
00:35:46,114 --> 00:35:47,682
-You cook?
-Mmhmm.

612
00:35:47,782 --> 00:35:49,149
Hmm.

613
00:35:49,249 --> 00:35:50,551
A man of many talents.

614
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:52,687
Mmhmm.

615
00:35:55,556 --> 00:35:58,059
But, if you remember
our most recent conversation,

616
00:35:58,158 --> 00:36:00,260
I'm just not ready
to change my mind.

617
00:36:01,428 --> 00:36:04,197
Woman, it is just dinner.

618
00:36:04,297 --> 00:36:05,633
I thought after today, you'd be

619
00:36:05,733 --> 00:36:07,835
too tired to go home
and cook yourself.

620
00:36:09,403 --> 00:36:11,139
And just would've been
really nice to be able to eat

621
00:36:11,238 --> 00:36:13,240
dinner with someone, but...

622
00:36:14,876 --> 00:36:15,777
It is tempting.

623
00:36:15,877 --> 00:36:17,477
Yeah.

624
00:36:17,578 --> 00:36:18,846
And I am tired.

625
00:36:20,615 --> 00:36:22,382
Alright, cowboy.

626
00:36:22,482 --> 00:36:24,752
But last one through the barn
has to clean the stalls.

627
00:36:24,852 --> 00:36:26,788
What?

628
00:36:34,996 --> 00:36:35,763
-Oh.
-Oh.

629
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:37,799
-Sorry.
-No, you're good.

630
00:36:37,899 --> 00:36:38,800
What's so interesting?

631
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,835
Oh, just a little light reading.

632
00:36:40,935 --> 00:36:42,302
So, you're really gonna do it.

633
00:36:42,402 --> 00:36:45,106
I mean, I'll enter. But I don't
know how well I'll do.

634
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:47,207
-Well how's your training going?
-Pretty good.

635
00:36:47,307 --> 00:36:49,610
I feel like Chango's the one
teaching me the barrels.

636
00:36:49,711 --> 00:36:52,212
Stay with it. I can't wait to
see you beat Madison.

637
00:36:52,312 --> 00:36:54,115
Well, that's not why
I'm doing it.

638
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:56,951
Yeah, but it would feel
pretty good.

639
00:36:57,051 --> 00:36:58,186
We should go riding sometime.

640
00:36:58,285 --> 00:37:00,154
I know some nice trails
around Clint's place.

641
00:37:00,253 --> 00:37:02,222
What are you doing Saturday?

642
00:37:02,322 --> 00:37:05,358
Um, practice, and chores,
and stuff.

643
00:37:05,459 --> 00:37:06,627
Well, see if it's cool

644
00:37:06,728 --> 00:37:09,063
and I'll ride over
in the afternoon and get you.

645
00:37:09,163 --> 00:37:11,132
Sounds like fun.

646
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:12,667
-Bye.
-Bye.

647
00:37:19,741 --> 00:37:22,409
Mom, Charlie's falling asleep
at the table again.

648
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,478
Mikey, don't tattle.

649
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:26,013
Charlie, go take a shower.

650
00:37:26,114 --> 00:37:27,982
It's late
and you smell like a barn.

651
00:37:28,082 --> 00:37:30,718
It's my favorite smell.
They should make a perfume.

652
00:37:30,818 --> 00:37:32,987
Oh yeah, I bet that would be
a big seller.

653
00:37:33,087 --> 00:37:34,522
Now go get cleaned up.

654
00:37:34,622 --> 00:37:35,690
I'd buy it.

655
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,735
Here.

656
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,838
Hey Mr. Holden!

657
00:38:23,938 --> 00:38:25,973
Hey, Zach! How're you doing?

658
00:38:26,073 --> 00:38:28,776
What's your pa up
to this weekend?

659
00:38:28,876 --> 00:38:30,343
Well, he's...

660
00:38:30,443 --> 00:38:31,444
he's cutting fields,

661
00:38:31,546 --> 00:38:33,413
but mom says if he gets done
on time,

662
00:38:33,514 --> 00:38:35,149
he can watch the ball game.

663
00:38:35,249 --> 00:38:37,251
"Happy wife, happy life".

664
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:40,021
Yes, sir. I've heard my mom use
that one before.

665
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:41,055
How's it going, Charlie?

666
00:38:41,155 --> 00:38:42,322
Hi, Zach.

667
00:38:42,422 --> 00:38:43,558
Your horse is kind
of a beast.

668
00:38:43,658 --> 00:38:46,160
Oh yeah. Hercules is my buddy
for sure.

669
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,460
Hercules?

670
00:38:47,562 --> 00:38:50,865
Oh, was... his real name is
something long and fancy

671
00:38:50,965 --> 00:38:52,533
that I can never remember, but

672
00:38:52,633 --> 00:38:54,535
I knew he was a Hercules
on the inside.

673
00:38:56,137 --> 00:38:57,638
This is a first for Chango.

674
00:38:57,738 --> 00:38:59,941
So, he's not used to it.
Slow and steady.

675
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:01,809
Yes, sir.

676
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:03,211
You can count on us.

677
00:39:03,311 --> 00:39:04,679
And don't come home too late

678
00:39:04,779 --> 00:39:06,479
or I'll get a hundred calls
from your mama.

679
00:39:07,548 --> 00:39:09,416
Yes, sir, we won't.

680
00:39:13,621 --> 00:39:14,889
So how come you transferred
to our school

681
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:16,423
in the middle of last year?

682
00:39:16,524 --> 00:39:19,560
Well, um,
my parents got divorced

683
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,195
and then when we sold
our old house

684
00:39:21,295 --> 00:39:23,064
we moved closer
to my mom's work.

685
00:39:23,164 --> 00:39:24,364
Must have been rough.

686
00:39:24,464 --> 00:39:26,200
Yeah, it was pretty bad.

687
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,035
Not easy being the new girl?

688
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:30,403
Most kids are nice,
except for...

689
00:39:30,504 --> 00:39:31,539
-Madison.
-Madison.

690
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:32,506
Yeah.

691
00:39:32,607 --> 00:39:36,010
Yeah, she's tricky.
But she's not all bad.

692
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:38,012
Really?

693
00:39:38,112 --> 00:39:39,547
Okay, she's pretty bad but,

694
00:39:39,647 --> 00:39:40,615
I've known her
since kindergarten.

695
00:39:40,715 --> 00:39:42,884
She has her own stuff
to deal with.

696
00:39:42,984 --> 00:39:45,219
Her parents are super-rich.

697
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:48,122
Oh, spare me.
Such a tough problem.

698
00:39:48,222 --> 00:39:49,624
Spend hardly any time with her.

699
00:39:49,724 --> 00:39:51,893
And her dad puts
all this pressure on her.

700
00:39:51,993 --> 00:39:55,329
- For what?
- Everything. Sports. Grades.

701
00:39:55,428 --> 00:39:57,365
And especially
on her barrel racing.

702
00:39:57,464 --> 00:40:00,301
They got a whole stable
with trainers and staff.

703
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,170
Still sounds
like a pretty good life.

704
00:40:03,271 --> 00:40:04,839
-Don't you get it?
-No.

705
00:40:04,939 --> 00:40:07,174
It's all work for her,
and then she--

706
00:40:07,275 --> 00:40:08,776
she's in trouble
if she doesn't win.

707
00:40:08,876 --> 00:40:11,212
She never gets
to ride for just fun.

708
00:40:11,312 --> 00:40:13,314
Yeah, it does sound pretty bad.

709
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:14,849
No wonder she's so mean.

710
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:18,052
Speaking of fun,
let's pick up the pace.

711
00:40:19,921 --> 00:40:21,289
Charlie, wait.

712
00:40:21,389 --> 00:40:22,957
Slow down!

713
00:40:36,771 --> 00:40:37,905
Charlie!

714
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,473
Charlie, where are you?

715
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:43,945
Charlie?

716
00:40:45,112 --> 00:40:46,047
Charlie.

717
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:49,216
You okay?

718
00:40:49,317 --> 00:40:50,351
We took a tumble.

719
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:51,652
What happened?

720
00:40:51,752 --> 00:40:53,120
Well, I was just trying
to go faster

721
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,056
and he slipped on some rocks.

722
00:40:55,156 --> 00:40:56,456
We should call for help.

723
00:40:58,025 --> 00:40:59,093
There's no service.

724
00:41:00,493 --> 00:41:02,596
Alright, look he--
he should be okay, but

725
00:41:02,697 --> 00:41:03,698
just-- just to be safe.

726
00:41:03,798 --> 00:41:05,099
Give me your reins
and let's-- let's--

727
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:06,600
let's get you back.

728
00:41:14,608 --> 00:41:16,210
It just goes straight
to voicemail,

729
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,712
whenever I call.

730
00:41:21,082 --> 00:41:22,984
I'm just-- I'm so sorry.

731
00:41:37,164 --> 00:41:38,632
What happened?

732
00:41:38,733 --> 00:41:40,468
Where have you been?

733
00:41:40,568 --> 00:41:41,535
Why didn't you call?

734
00:41:41,635 --> 00:41:42,803
Beth, slow down.

735
00:41:42,903 --> 00:41:44,105
Slow down.

736
00:41:44,205 --> 00:41:45,306
Are you okay?

737
00:41:45,406 --> 00:41:47,975
Mom, I'm fine,
but Chango isn't.

738
00:41:49,076 --> 00:41:51,278
Okay, well, let's get him in and
then we can talk.

739
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:58,352
How well you listen right now
is gonna play a big part

740
00:41:58,452 --> 00:42:00,421
in whether or not
you get to keep riding.

741
00:42:00,521 --> 00:42:01,889
Mom, you can't just do that!

742
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:03,824
I care about Chango
more than anything!

743
00:42:03,924 --> 00:42:05,059
He's not safe.

744
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:06,961
You could have got hurt
and you scared me to death.

745
00:42:07,061 --> 00:42:08,696
Mrs. Mitchell, it's--
it's all my fault.

746
00:42:08,796 --> 00:42:09,864
I wanted to go off the trail.

747
00:42:09,964 --> 00:42:11,565
I thought it would be more fun.

748
00:42:11,665 --> 00:42:12,666
She could have said "no".

749
00:42:12,767 --> 00:42:13,868
She didn't know the way back.

750
00:42:13,968 --> 00:42:15,603
And Chango didn't do
anything wrong.

751
00:42:15,703 --> 00:42:17,171
He just slipped on a wet rock.

752
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:18,706
Wait, no, Zach.
No, that's not--

753
00:42:18,806 --> 00:42:20,509
It was my responsibility.

754
00:42:20,608 --> 00:42:23,244
Please do not punish Charlie
for my bad judgement.

755
00:42:23,344 --> 00:42:24,678
Please.

756
00:42:24,779 --> 00:42:25,946
I'll think about it.

757
00:42:26,047 --> 00:42:28,582
But for now,
stay off that horse.

758
00:42:28,682 --> 00:42:30,785
Think of yourself as grounded.

759
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:38,159
I think we should get rid
of him.

760
00:42:38,259 --> 00:42:39,994
Whoa, that seems a bit harsh.

761
00:42:40,094 --> 00:42:41,762
Are you really gonna tell me
what's best for my kid?

762
00:42:41,862 --> 00:42:43,798
I wouldn't even dream
about that.

763
00:42:43,898 --> 00:42:46,233
Seriously, what do you think
any good parent would do here?

764
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:47,668
You know, Beth?
I don't even know

765
00:42:47,768 --> 00:42:50,438
what it takes to be a parent.
But I do have a suggestion.

766
00:42:50,539 --> 00:42:51,639
And what's that?

767
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:53,007
You can discipline to encourage

768
00:42:53,107 --> 00:42:55,476
or you can discipline
to discourage.

769
00:42:55,576 --> 00:42:58,179
Same for animals
as it is for humans, I think.

770
00:42:58,279 --> 00:42:59,780
What's that?

771
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:04,185
Encouraging tends to feel better
and seems to last a bit longer.

772
00:43:04,285 --> 00:43:05,486
I don't know.

773
00:43:05,586 --> 00:43:07,522
I didn't sign up
for any of this.

774
00:43:07,621 --> 00:43:09,356
Look, this could have happened
to anybody.

775
00:43:09,457 --> 00:43:10,691
And Charlie didn't even
get hurt.

776
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:12,093
And the horse took the brunt
of it.

777
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:15,629
Maybe they deserve
a second chance.

778
00:43:15,729 --> 00:43:17,331
I'm not big on second chances.

779
00:43:20,401 --> 00:43:22,002
You think about it? Okay?

780
00:43:23,003 --> 00:43:25,439
He's gotta be on stall rest and

781
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,108
hand-walking
for the next couple of days.

782
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:30,044
Just don't make a decision
you might regret later.

783
00:43:30,144 --> 00:43:31,946
I'll think about it.

784
00:43:49,363 --> 00:43:50,731
How's it going, Charlie?

785
00:43:53,367 --> 00:43:55,469
-Why did you do it?
-What?

786
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:56,971
You know exactly what.

787
00:43:58,472 --> 00:44:00,007
I didn't want you to get
in trouble.

788
00:44:00,107 --> 00:44:01,175
Why not?

789
00:44:03,077 --> 00:44:04,445
You know why.

790
00:44:04,546 --> 00:44:06,080
I like you.

791
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,214
And I like you, too?

792
00:44:08,415 --> 00:44:10,885
No, I mean I like you,
like you.

793
00:44:14,788 --> 00:44:16,090
We're talking here.

794
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,358
It's my desk.

795
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:19,793
Hey, just chill for a minute. Go
sharpen a pencil or something.

796
00:44:24,665 --> 00:44:25,634
As you were saying...

797
00:44:25,733 --> 00:44:27,501
What was I saying?

798
00:44:27,602 --> 00:44:29,403
That you like me.

799
00:44:29,504 --> 00:44:31,305
That that you like me,
like me.

800
00:44:34,208 --> 00:44:35,476
Is this some joke?

801
00:44:35,577 --> 00:44:36,545
Something you
and Madison made up

802
00:44:36,645 --> 00:44:38,513
to make me look like an idiot?

803
00:44:38,613 --> 00:44:39,980
Wha-- are you kidding me?

804
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,882
Why would you even think that?

805
00:44:41,982 --> 00:44:43,652
I don't know. Maybe I've seen
all those movies,

806
00:44:43,751 --> 00:44:45,352
where the cool guy asks out
the geek girl,

807
00:44:45,452 --> 00:44:46,420
and then the joke is on her.

808
00:44:48,889 --> 00:44:51,759
If that's what you think,
just forget what I said

809
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:53,994
and uh, keep on hating life.

810
00:44:54,094 --> 00:44:55,597
It's working out great
for you so far.

811
00:45:06,073 --> 00:45:08,742
It's just too dangerous.
I think Chango needs to go.

812
00:45:10,244 --> 00:45:14,181
Mom, he was real nice
when I rode him.

813
00:45:14,281 --> 00:45:16,585
Once.
Once you rode.

814
00:45:16,685 --> 00:45:19,320
Actually, I have a few times.

815
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,821
What? When?

816
00:45:20,921 --> 00:45:22,923
I just wanted to try.

817
00:45:23,023 --> 00:45:26,060
Plus, I kinda like hanging out
with Charlie.

818
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,329
I like hanging out with you
too, squirt.

819
00:45:28,429 --> 00:45:29,797
So, now, you've both been lying?

820
00:45:29,897 --> 00:45:31,700
Mom, we were just trying
to spend time together.

821
00:45:31,799 --> 00:45:34,134
Yeah.
Yeah, quality sibling time.

822
00:45:34,235 --> 00:45:36,070
It's supposed to be
a healthy thing.

823
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:38,372
I'm not too happy about
any of this right now.

824
00:45:38,472 --> 00:45:41,242
Look, just hear them out, Beth.

825
00:45:43,578 --> 00:45:44,778
First of all, I lied.

826
00:45:44,878 --> 00:45:46,013
I know.
You just said that.

827
00:45:46,113 --> 00:45:48,315
No, I mean about something else.

828
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,751
You know, they say the more you
lie, the easier it gets.

829
00:45:50,851 --> 00:45:53,387
Well, I just sat there
and Zach took the blame for me.

830
00:45:54,656 --> 00:45:55,856
I'm the one who went off
on the trail.

831
00:45:55,956 --> 00:45:57,825
I'm the one who went too fast.

832
00:45:57,925 --> 00:46:00,027
I'm the one to blame
for everything.

833
00:46:00,127 --> 00:46:02,763
You're not making a real strong
case for keeping the horse.

834
00:46:02,863 --> 00:46:04,331
Mom, I love him.

835
00:46:04,431 --> 00:46:05,866
And he loves me, too.

836
00:46:07,501 --> 00:46:08,936
Please let me keep him.

837
00:46:11,772 --> 00:46:14,408
Fine.
But not one more screw-up.

838
00:46:16,944 --> 00:46:18,212
Now, let me get this straight.

839
00:46:18,312 --> 00:46:20,381
When you say you love him,
are you talking about Chango

840
00:46:20,481 --> 00:46:21,683
or the boy?

841
00:46:21,782 --> 00:46:23,817
-Zach. His name is Zach.
-What? No!

842
00:46:23,917 --> 00:46:24,852
-What?
-Which-- which one?

843
00:46:24,952 --> 00:46:26,153
-No, wait.
-I think it was maybe--

844
00:46:26,253 --> 00:46:27,522
-I thought it was Zach.
-No, no, no...

845
00:46:27,622 --> 00:46:28,389
Wait. Now,
I wanna know what this is.

846
00:46:28,489 --> 00:46:29,256
Are you talking about Zach?

847
00:46:29,356 --> 00:46:30,391
-I just-- I-- I--
-I think it's Zach.

848
00:46:30,491 --> 00:46:31,559
-No, no, no. I--
-She loves Zach,

849
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:32,493
but she wants to ride the horse.

850
00:46:32,594 --> 00:46:33,494
No, no, no.

851
00:46:33,595 --> 00:46:35,162
No.

852
00:47:04,526 --> 00:47:05,959
For what it's worth,

853
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,562
I think you made
the right decision.

854
00:47:08,797 --> 00:47:10,264
Why am I not surprised?

855
00:47:12,366 --> 00:47:13,601
Charlie, saddle up.

856
00:47:13,702 --> 00:47:15,502
We've gotta a lot of work to do.

857
00:47:15,603 --> 00:47:18,172
Rodeo is coming up fast
and we lost a lot of time.

858
00:47:20,374 --> 00:47:21,609
Mom?

859
00:47:27,247 --> 00:47:28,382
Mom?

860
00:47:34,955 --> 00:47:36,390
Can we go faster?

861
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:40,160
Not yet. We gotta do some yoga
for that horse first.

862
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,831
What the heck does that mean?

863
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:45,366
Just some stretching. He's got
to remember how to bend.

864
00:47:45,466 --> 00:47:48,469
Just start out with some
circles, both directions.

865
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,237
Then we'll do figure eights.

866
00:47:53,874 --> 00:47:56,243
Alright, that's nice. Nice.
Nice and easy.

867
00:47:58,379 --> 00:47:59,581
Atta girl.

868
00:48:04,819 --> 00:48:06,855
I still don't see the point
in this.

869
00:48:06,954 --> 00:48:08,322
You want this?

870
00:48:08,422 --> 00:48:09,791
Yeah. More than anything.

871
00:48:09,923 --> 00:48:11,425
Then, do what I tell ya.

872
00:48:23,638 --> 00:48:25,239
Easy.

873
00:48:25,339 --> 00:48:26,306
Ah, okay.

874
00:48:26,407 --> 00:48:28,142
Here's one of the little things
that matters.

875
00:48:28,242 --> 00:48:30,344
When you're riding barrels,
look for the pocket.

876
00:48:30,444 --> 00:48:31,478
What's that?

877
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:33,548
The area around the barrel.

878
00:48:33,648 --> 00:48:35,282
You wanna push past that.

879
00:48:35,382 --> 00:48:37,719
Horses always go where
their rider is looking.

880
00:48:37,819 --> 00:48:39,420
So, look ahead
to where I wanna go?

881
00:48:39,521 --> 00:48:40,454
Exactly.

882
00:48:41,689 --> 00:48:42,590
Anything else?

883
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:44,491
Yeah. Have fun.

884
00:48:44,592 --> 00:48:45,492
No sense doing all of this

885
00:48:45,593 --> 00:48:47,428
unless you're having the time
of your life.

886
00:48:59,774 --> 00:49:01,643
Hey, dad, it's me.

887
00:49:01,743 --> 00:49:03,578
Uh, wanted to make sure
you remembered that

888
00:49:03,678 --> 00:49:05,580
my competition is next weekend.

889
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,582
Call me back. Love you. Bye.

890
00:49:09,784 --> 00:49:11,485
You know, he may not make it.

891
00:49:12,787 --> 00:49:14,421
He said he'd be there.

892
00:49:14,522 --> 00:49:16,156
He might have to work
or something.

893
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:19,092
Why do you always do that?

894
00:49:19,193 --> 00:49:20,227
What?

895
00:49:20,327 --> 00:49:22,029
Always think the worst
about dad.

896
00:49:23,598 --> 00:49:24,699
I'm just saying,

897
00:49:24,799 --> 00:49:26,233
don't get your hopes up
too much.

898
00:49:28,502 --> 00:49:29,737
He'll show.

899
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:39,747
Hear you're competing
in the Junior Rodeo.

900
00:49:39,848 --> 00:49:40,949
Yes, sir.

901
00:49:41,048 --> 00:49:43,250
You never got a lead
on that horse you found?

902
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:45,252
No, sir.

903
00:49:45,352 --> 00:49:46,688
Darndest thing I ever heard of.

904
00:49:46,788 --> 00:49:47,889
Hm.

905
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:49,256
Well, good luck young lady.

906
00:49:49,356 --> 00:49:51,391
Thank you, Mr. Johnson.

907
00:49:51,492 --> 00:49:52,627
She any good?

908
00:49:52,727 --> 00:49:55,630
Got a better than fair shot
at surprising a few people.

909
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:58,098
I expect I know who one
of those people might be.

910
00:49:58,198 --> 00:49:59,667
I'll bet you do.

911
00:50:01,034 --> 00:50:02,637
Tell you what, Charlie Mitchell.

912
00:50:02,737 --> 00:50:04,706
You beat that Farnsworth gal,

913
00:50:04,806 --> 00:50:07,909
Johnson Feed Store might just
be your first sponsor.

914
00:50:08,008 --> 00:50:09,611
Thank you.

915
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:16,651
Hey, Mr. Holden.

916
00:50:16,751 --> 00:50:17,852
Zach. How you doing?

917
00:50:17,952 --> 00:50:20,254
I haven't seen you
since the incident.

918
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:23,290
Ah, about that. There's
something I need to tell you.

919
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:24,893
That you lied about
what happened.

920
00:50:24,993 --> 00:50:26,761
I told 'em.

921
00:50:26,861 --> 00:50:28,228
Great. Thanks a lot.

922
00:50:28,328 --> 00:50:30,565
No, no, no. I told them
that it was my fault.

923
00:50:32,466 --> 00:50:33,835
I still lied.

924
00:50:33,935 --> 00:50:35,570
Yes, you did.

925
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:38,640
And you got to remember,
a man's word is his bond.

926
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,742
Reputation is everything.

927
00:50:40,842 --> 00:50:41,809
Yes, sir.

928
00:50:43,076 --> 00:50:44,879
Fella must really like someone

929
00:50:44,979 --> 00:50:46,748
if he's willing to lay that
on the line.

930
00:50:47,916 --> 00:50:49,483
Yes, sir. He must.

931
00:50:50,985 --> 00:50:52,554
Well, we'd best get going.

932
00:50:52,654 --> 00:50:55,055
Good luck at the rodeo.
We'll be rooting for you.

933
00:50:55,155 --> 00:50:57,124
Oh, and uh,

934
00:50:57,224 --> 00:50:58,693
good luck with that
other thing, too.

935
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:18,378
Okay, everyone, books away.

936
00:51:22,517 --> 00:51:24,619
No more talking
till the bell rings.

937
00:51:27,187 --> 00:51:28,523
I'm sure everyone here remembers

938
00:51:28,623 --> 00:51:31,224
that this test is 30%
of your final grade,

939
00:51:31,325 --> 00:51:33,828
so it's a big deal.

940
00:52:43,463 --> 00:52:45,066
You're still slicing
that second barrel.

941
00:52:45,165 --> 00:52:46,134
When you let him turn
too soon,

942
00:52:46,233 --> 00:52:48,468
he's out of position
for the next one.

943
00:52:48,569 --> 00:52:49,704
Try again.

944
00:52:59,479 --> 00:53:01,015
Uh-oh.

945
00:53:01,115 --> 00:53:02,482
Hi Beth.

946
00:53:03,751 --> 00:53:06,286
Charlotte Grace,
get off that horse right now.

947
00:53:06,386 --> 00:53:07,622
What's the matter, mom?

948
00:53:07,722 --> 00:53:09,524
Did you really think
you wouldn't get caught?

949
00:53:09,624 --> 00:53:10,958
I'm so confused.

950
00:53:11,059 --> 00:53:12,593
Let me help you.
What if I told you

951
00:53:12,694 --> 00:53:14,962
I just got off the phone
with your Principal.

952
00:53:15,063 --> 00:53:17,464
Mom, I really don't know where
you're going with this.

953
00:53:17,565 --> 00:53:19,466
And why am I not surprised
you'd lie about it.

954
00:53:19,567 --> 00:53:21,035
It's not like we haven't seen
this before.

955
00:53:21,135 --> 00:53:22,704
Now, get off the horse.

956
00:53:22,804 --> 00:53:24,872
How can I lie when I don't even
know what I did wrong?

957
00:53:24,972 --> 00:53:26,239
Apparently,
your algebra exam

958
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:28,543
came back with one of the
highest scores in the class.

959
00:53:28,643 --> 00:53:29,844
Get off the horse.

960
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,082
And I'm in trouble for that?

961
00:53:34,182 --> 00:53:35,415
I had an A in there anyway.

962
00:53:35,516 --> 00:53:37,085
Your teacher didn't think
anything about it.

963
00:53:37,185 --> 00:53:38,720
Until he found out you cheated.

964
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,822
What? Mom, I would never.

965
00:53:40,922 --> 00:53:42,489
Don't bother. He has proof.

966
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:44,592
No, there must be some mistake.
I don't cheat.

967
00:53:44,692 --> 00:53:46,060
The mistake was letting you
keep this horse

968
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,294
and spend so much time
out here

969
00:53:47,394 --> 00:53:49,262
that you couldn't keep up
with your schoolwork.

970
00:53:49,362 --> 00:53:50,363
Mom, what are you saying?

971
00:53:50,464 --> 00:53:51,364
I'm saying you're done.

972
00:53:51,465 --> 00:53:52,934
You're not coming out here
anymore.

973
00:53:54,401 --> 00:53:56,236
Beth, can we just
talk about this?

974
00:53:56,336 --> 00:53:57,739
You stay out of this.

975
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:58,940
She cheated. She lied.

976
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,440
And now for the icing
on the cake

977
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:02,877
she's suspended from school and
getting a zero in that class.

978
00:54:02,977 --> 00:54:03,878
Do you know what this means?

979
00:54:03,978 --> 00:54:05,479
Mom, I promise I didn't do it.

980
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,247
Let's just hear Charlie's side
of the story

981
00:54:07,347 --> 00:54:09,316
and maybe we can figure out
exactly what happened.

982
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:10,852
You know, I partially blame you
for this, too.

983
00:54:10,952 --> 00:54:11,919
Me?

984
00:54:12,019 --> 00:54:14,021
You just had to take her out
looking for a horse.

985
00:54:14,122 --> 00:54:15,388
Well, here, he's yours.

986
00:54:15,489 --> 00:54:16,991
-Take him.
-What? No.

987
00:54:17,091 --> 00:54:18,760
Beth, can we just talk
about this?

988
00:54:23,631 --> 00:54:25,199
You know this is hard for me,
too.

989
00:54:25,298 --> 00:54:26,868
Yeah, I'll bet.

990
00:54:26,968 --> 00:54:28,970
It's not always easy having
to be the bad guy.

991
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:33,273
Well, this one doesn't seem to
be exactly breaking your heart.

992
00:54:33,373 --> 00:54:34,542
Look, Charlie,

993
00:54:34,642 --> 00:54:36,010
you know I always want
what's best for you.

994
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:37,377
And Chango grew on me.

995
00:54:37,477 --> 00:54:38,880
But you're in big trouble.

996
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:42,382
I didn't do it!
I aced that exam on my own.

997
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:44,484
Look, all I know is you lied
about

998
00:54:44,585 --> 00:54:45,653
being on the trail
with Zach

999
00:54:45,753 --> 00:54:47,487
and you lied about teaching
Mikey to ride.

1000
00:54:47,588 --> 00:54:49,356
That was part my idea, too.

1001
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:52,727
I cannot believe this.

1002
00:54:52,827 --> 00:54:54,829
I think I'm just gonna go
live with dad.

1003
00:54:54,929 --> 00:54:56,130
No!

1004
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:57,665
You're not going to live
with Troy.

1005
00:54:57,765 --> 00:54:59,432
Where's your dad been
through any of this?

1006
00:54:59,534 --> 00:55:01,235
You just can't count on him
when the chips are down.

1007
00:55:01,334 --> 00:55:03,004
Stop talking about dad
like that!

1008
00:55:03,104 --> 00:55:04,437
You know it's true.

1009
00:55:04,539 --> 00:55:05,773
He means well
for the most part,

1010
00:55:05,873 --> 00:55:08,341
and I'll always love him
for giving me the two of you,

1011
00:55:08,441 --> 00:55:09,577
but it's always a coin toss

1012
00:55:09,677 --> 00:55:11,546
if he's going to be there
when it's crunch time.

1013
00:55:11,646 --> 00:55:13,346
So, don't bring it up again.

1014
00:55:25,092 --> 00:55:26,326
Hey.

1015
00:55:26,426 --> 00:55:27,728
Charlie wasn't here today.

1016
00:55:27,829 --> 00:55:28,830
So?

1017
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:30,330
She never misses a day.

1018
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:32,633
Are you really trying
to figure out girls?

1019
00:55:32,733 --> 00:55:34,334
Just give up now.

1020
00:55:34,434 --> 00:55:36,971
Didn't you hear?
She got suspended.

1021
00:55:37,071 --> 00:55:38,739
No way. You're joking.

1022
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:42,176
I heard that little Miss Smarty
Pants got caught cheating.

1023
00:55:42,276 --> 00:55:43,744
No way.

1024
00:55:43,845 --> 00:55:46,914
Apparently, Mr. Whitman found
her cheat sheet or something.

1025
00:55:47,014 --> 00:55:48,015
She wouldn't do that.

1026
00:55:48,115 --> 00:55:51,185
I guess I'm not surprised
you'd take up for that.

1027
00:55:51,285 --> 00:55:52,954
Stop it. Just shut up.

1028
00:56:02,897 --> 00:56:04,732
Mr. Whitman?

1029
00:56:04,832 --> 00:56:05,867
Zach.

1030
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,270
What can I do you for?

1031
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:11,172
She didn't do it.

1032
00:56:11,272 --> 00:56:12,372
Didn't do what?

1033
00:56:12,472 --> 00:56:14,675
Charlie.
She would never cheat.

1034
00:56:14,775 --> 00:56:17,511
Well, I found proof
to the contrary.

1035
00:56:17,612 --> 00:56:19,780
What kind of proof?

1036
00:56:19,881 --> 00:56:21,148
I can't say.

1037
00:56:21,249 --> 00:56:23,416
You know teachers
can't discuss students

1038
00:56:23,517 --> 00:56:25,052
with anyone but the parent.

1039
00:56:25,152 --> 00:56:26,087
I know her.

1040
00:56:26,187 --> 00:56:27,922
Well, I know what I found.

1041
00:56:29,523 --> 00:56:30,958
How can I help prove
she didn't cheat?

1042
00:56:34,595 --> 00:56:37,231
I guess we could have
a discussion about

1043
00:56:37,331 --> 00:56:39,399
a "hypothetical situation".

1044
00:56:39,499 --> 00:56:43,137
Fair enough. Now, tell me about
this "proof".

1045
00:56:43,237 --> 00:56:45,273
Oh, it was good.

1046
00:56:45,373 --> 00:56:47,708
Low tech, low risk.

1047
00:56:47,808 --> 00:56:50,111
Not like some
of these other students

1048
00:56:50,211 --> 00:56:51,946
that use cell phones
and calculators.

1049
00:56:53,214 --> 00:56:54,615
So,
what was this low-tech thing?

1050
00:56:56,384 --> 00:56:57,718
Rubber band bracelet.

1051
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:06,060
This. This is what I'm talking
about.

1052
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,494
That's not anything.

1053
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:16,137
Mr. Whitman, Charlie got set up
by someone and I know who.

1054
00:57:16,237 --> 00:57:17,204
It was Madison.

1055
00:57:18,406 --> 00:57:19,874
That's not possible.

1056
00:57:19,974 --> 00:57:23,644
I mean, the-- the Farnsworth's
are a fine, upstanding family

1057
00:57:23,744 --> 00:57:26,580
in this community.
Now look, son, you--

1058
00:57:26,681 --> 00:57:29,116
you can't go around accusing
people just to save your friend.

1059
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:31,786
With all due respect, sir,

1060
00:57:31,886 --> 00:57:34,622
I'm 100% sure
that Charlie didn't cheat

1061
00:57:34,722 --> 00:57:36,524
and I'm gonna prove it.

1062
00:57:36,624 --> 00:57:38,292
Charlie did it.

1063
00:57:38,392 --> 00:57:40,328
Case closed.

1064
00:57:40,428 --> 00:57:41,896
Fair enough.

1065
00:57:41,996 --> 00:57:42,797
We'll see about that.

1066
00:57:42,897 --> 00:57:45,066
I'm going to Principal Goodwin.

1067
00:57:45,166 --> 00:57:46,267
All right.

1068
00:57:46,367 --> 00:57:47,902
Like I said,

1069
00:57:48,002 --> 00:57:50,504
you can't discuss a student
with anyone but a parent.

1070
00:58:07,888 --> 00:58:09,290
Mr. Holden?

1071
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:10,992
Hey, over here, Zach.

1072
00:58:15,396 --> 00:58:17,198
It's awfully quiet out here.

1073
00:58:17,298 --> 00:58:18,599
Yup.

1074
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:20,868
I heard what happened.

1075
00:58:22,603 --> 00:58:24,071
What version?

1076
00:58:24,171 --> 00:58:25,573
She didn't do it.

1077
00:58:25,673 --> 00:58:26,974
I'd like to believe that, too.

1078
00:58:27,074 --> 00:58:28,409
No, I'm-- I'm serious.

1079
00:58:28,509 --> 00:58:29,610
She got set up.

1080
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:31,912
By Madison Farnsworth.

1081
00:58:32,013 --> 00:58:33,314
Farnsworth?

1082
00:58:33,414 --> 00:58:35,082
You don't say.

1083
00:58:35,182 --> 00:58:36,517
I do say.

1084
00:58:55,002 --> 00:58:57,138
You claim that Madison did this.

1085
00:58:57,238 --> 00:58:59,540
I saw her and her friends
wearing the bracelets.

1086
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,075
I didn't see Charlie
wearing one.

1087
00:59:01,175 --> 00:59:03,077
You should be looking
at their test scores.

1088
00:59:03,177 --> 00:59:04,979
You just can't go around
accusing people

1089
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:06,080
of planting evidence.

1090
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:07,882
But you can go around accusing
people of cheating?

1091
00:59:07,982 --> 00:59:09,917
And then kick them out
of school for it?

1092
00:59:10,017 --> 00:59:11,285
It's school policy.

1093
00:59:11,385 --> 00:59:13,921
Look, I'm not an expert here.
But in a court of law,

1094
00:59:14,021 --> 00:59:16,490
you're proven guilty
by beyond reasonable doubt.

1095
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:18,426
So, if it's good enough
for the courts,

1096
00:59:18,527 --> 00:59:19,894
shouldn't it be good enough
for a school?

1097
00:59:19,994 --> 00:59:22,563
I'm sorry,
but without any proof...

1098
00:59:22,663 --> 00:59:24,799
I do have proof.

1099
00:59:24,899 --> 00:59:26,901
Is that enough to at least
make you ask some questions?

1100
00:59:27,001 --> 00:59:29,003
Reasonable doubt. Right there.

1101
00:59:32,106 --> 00:59:35,976
Well, in light
of Zach's contribution,

1102
00:59:36,077 --> 00:59:38,612
perhaps we can negate
Charlie's suspension.

1103
00:59:38,712 --> 00:59:39,880
What about failing the test?

1104
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:41,715
What about it?

1105
00:59:41,816 --> 00:59:43,884
Let her retake it.
And Mr. Whitman can watch.

1106
00:59:43,984 --> 00:59:45,786
If she passes,
drop the whole thing.

1107
00:59:45,886 --> 00:59:47,388
Seems reasonable.

1108
00:59:47,488 --> 00:59:48,923
Might owe an apology even,

1109
00:59:49,023 --> 00:59:50,525
before suspending
the Farnsworth girl.

1110
00:59:50,658 --> 00:59:52,259
Let's not get carried away.

1111
00:59:53,661 --> 00:59:57,431
I'll let Charlie retake the test
and we'll go from there.

1112
01:00:03,471 --> 01:00:05,072
Why are we here?

1113
01:00:05,172 --> 01:00:06,273
Just wait and see.

1114
01:00:27,394 --> 01:00:29,430
What is going on?

1115
01:00:29,531 --> 01:00:31,699
Charlie, I owe you
the biggest apology.

1116
01:00:31,799 --> 01:00:33,602
I know you didn't cheat
on that test.

1117
01:00:33,701 --> 01:00:35,102
I'm so sorry.

1118
01:00:35,202 --> 01:00:36,571
You are?

1119
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:38,540
Zach and Clint
never doubted you.

1120
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:39,840
Zach and I went
to your principal

1121
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,476
and we got everything
straightened out.

1122
01:00:42,577 --> 01:00:44,211
How did you manage this?

1123
01:00:44,311 --> 01:00:47,616
Well, we made your principal
an offer she couldn't refuse.

1124
01:00:47,715 --> 01:00:49,283
-You threatened her?
-No.

1125
01:00:49,383 --> 01:00:51,620
No. It's just an expression.

1126
01:00:51,719 --> 01:00:53,187
What kind of criminal
do you think I am?

1127
01:00:53,287 --> 01:00:55,689
I'm gonna sleep so much better
tonight knowing that.

1128
01:00:56,824 --> 01:00:58,292
So, what happened?

1129
01:00:58,392 --> 01:01:02,296
Well, we had a material witness
and a little bit of leverage.

1130
01:01:04,131 --> 01:01:06,934
Well, why don't we all just
bring it in for a group hug?

1131
01:01:08,202 --> 01:01:09,170
Come on, everybody.

1132
01:01:10,437 --> 01:01:12,706
Bring it in.

1133
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,016
Okay,
Charlie, this is game day.

1134
01:01:22,116 --> 01:01:24,084
There'll be
a lot of people there.

1135
01:01:24,185 --> 01:01:25,119
I get it.

1136
01:01:26,353 --> 01:01:28,623
I know you do.

1137
01:01:28,722 --> 01:01:30,991
I just don't want you to get
intimidated

1138
01:01:31,091 --> 01:01:33,327
by all the fancy things that
don't matter.

1139
01:01:34,995 --> 01:01:35,930
Like what?

1140
01:01:37,898 --> 01:01:40,000
It's gonna be a lot
of money there.

1141
01:01:41,101 --> 01:01:43,938
Trailers that are nicer
than some people's homes.

1142
01:01:44,972 --> 01:01:48,342
Horses that cost more
than most people's cars.

1143
01:01:48,442 --> 01:01:49,410
Money doesn't mean anything.

1144
01:01:52,179 --> 01:01:53,480
Well, money can mean
some things,

1145
01:01:53,582 --> 01:01:55,482
but it doesn't mean everything.

1146
01:01:55,584 --> 01:01:56,884
What counts is...

1147
01:01:56,984 --> 01:01:58,419
Opportunity means preparation.

1148
01:02:00,555 --> 01:02:01,889
Heart.

1149
01:02:01,989 --> 01:02:04,091
Nothing can beat your heart.

1150
01:02:04,191 --> 01:02:06,460
You have all the heart
in the world for this.

1151
01:02:09,664 --> 01:02:12,333
No matter what happens,
I'm so proud of you.

1152
01:02:14,235 --> 01:02:16,070
Good afternoon, ladies
and gentlemen.

1153
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:20,074
And welcome to the
State finals in barrel racing.

1154
01:02:51,305 --> 01:02:52,773
You ever play Pick up 52?

1155
01:02:52,873 --> 01:02:54,743
-No.
-You wanna play?

1156
01:02:54,842 --> 01:02:55,876
Yeah, sure.

1157
01:02:55,976 --> 01:02:57,545
We're gonna play it
all the way through.

1158
01:02:57,646 --> 01:02:58,779
-Yeah.
-All right.

1159
01:02:58,879 --> 01:03:00,981
-Mom, what's that?
-It's for you.

1160
01:03:01,081 --> 01:03:02,216
Open it.

1161
01:03:04,753 --> 01:03:05,853
No way!

1162
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:08,922
I'm so sorry I ever doubted you.

1163
01:03:09,023 --> 01:03:10,858
I just wanted to make sure
you get to go to college.

1164
01:03:10,958 --> 01:03:13,695
It's okay.
I was a total jerk.

1165
01:03:13,794 --> 01:03:15,764
Whatever.
I'm so proud of you.

1166
01:03:15,863 --> 01:03:17,197
Here.
Go, try this on.

1167
01:03:29,276 --> 01:03:30,277
Oh, wow.

1168
01:03:30,377 --> 01:03:31,513
You look amazing.

1169
01:03:31,613 --> 01:03:32,479
Yeah, you do.

1170
01:03:33,648 --> 01:03:35,215
You need to fuel up
before the ride.

1171
01:03:35,316 --> 01:03:36,450
Let's go get 'em something
to eat.

1172
01:03:41,088 --> 01:03:42,189
Whoa.

1173
01:03:42,289 --> 01:03:44,626
What, Shorty McShort Shorts?

1174
01:03:44,726 --> 01:03:46,393
Doesn't exactly look like you.

1175
01:03:46,493 --> 01:03:47,961
Is it bad?

1176
01:03:48,062 --> 01:03:50,397
I don't know.
You just look fancy.

1177
01:03:50,497 --> 01:03:51,533
Mom got it for me.

1178
01:03:52,933 --> 01:03:54,803
Man, sometimes,

1179
01:03:54,902 --> 01:03:57,639
I get emotional whiplash
from trying to follow you two.

1180
01:04:00,908 --> 01:04:02,142
Hey, what's up?

1181
01:04:02,242 --> 01:04:03,210
Are you mad?

1182
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:06,947
Not really.

1183
01:04:08,148 --> 01:04:10,317
But I hate it
when you call me names.

1184
01:04:10,417 --> 01:04:11,753
I don't call you names.

1185
01:04:11,852 --> 01:04:14,321
Mini-Mike? Short Stop Shrimp?

1186
01:04:14,421 --> 01:04:16,323
Shorty McShort Shorts?

1187
01:04:16,423 --> 01:04:17,925
I'm just kidding around.

1188
01:04:19,259 --> 01:04:20,994
Well, no one has
to keep reminding me

1189
01:04:21,095 --> 01:04:22,262
that I'm shorter than everyone.

1190
01:04:23,464 --> 01:04:24,733
Aww, I'm sorry, bud.

1191
01:04:24,833 --> 01:04:25,899
I didn't know it was a thing.

1192
01:04:25,999 --> 01:04:27,535
It's just my way
of showing affection.

1193
01:04:28,902 --> 01:04:30,505
And a reminder
of my worst fear,

1194
01:04:30,605 --> 01:04:31,506
that I may be done growing.

1195
01:04:32,674 --> 01:04:35,209
Dude. Never again.

1196
01:04:35,309 --> 01:04:36,410
Okay, pinky swear.

1197
01:04:38,979 --> 01:04:40,147
Pinky swear.

1198
01:04:44,017 --> 01:04:46,153
So, you actually look awesome.

1199
01:04:46,253 --> 01:04:47,822
You nervous?

1200
01:04:47,921 --> 01:04:50,057
Yeah, I kind of just want
to go home.

1201
01:04:50,157 --> 01:04:52,326
Okay, what kind of example
would quitting set for me?

1202
01:04:54,395 --> 01:04:56,463
I'm just joking.
Now go kick some...

1203
01:04:56,564 --> 01:04:58,132
Hey!

1204
01:04:58,232 --> 01:04:59,133
...butt.

1205
01:04:59,233 --> 01:05:01,001
Jeez, what did you think
I was gonna say?

1206
01:05:05,472 --> 01:05:06,440
Hey uh,

1207
01:05:08,075 --> 01:05:09,711
have you ever heard
of Pick Up 52?

1208
01:06:15,375 --> 01:06:17,144
You nervous?

1209
01:06:17,244 --> 01:06:18,278
Yeah.

1210
01:06:19,948 --> 01:06:21,181
I got something for ya.

1211
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:39,767
Isn't this your lucky hat?

1212
01:06:41,368 --> 01:06:42,469
Not anymore.

1213
01:06:48,943 --> 01:06:50,043
Remember what I told you

1214
01:06:50,143 --> 01:06:52,279
about a horse being
a mirror for your soul?

1215
01:06:52,379 --> 01:06:54,248
I don't think my dad made it.

1216
01:06:54,348 --> 01:06:55,282
Later.

1217
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:58,151
Focus on you.

1218
01:06:58,252 --> 01:07:01,088
All that matters right now
is getting to the next round.

1219
01:07:01,188 --> 01:07:02,356
What do you mean?

1220
01:07:02,456 --> 01:07:03,958
Well, a good time
will get us to the finish.

1221
01:07:04,057 --> 01:07:06,193
Anything under 19.5 should
get us there.

1222
01:07:08,161 --> 01:07:09,396
Do you think I'm ready?

1223
01:07:14,802 --> 01:07:17,337
You've asked me every which way
you can, Charlie.

1224
01:07:17,437 --> 01:07:19,741
There's only one thing
that matters.

1225
01:07:19,841 --> 01:07:20,708
Do you think you're ready?

1226
01:07:21,943 --> 01:07:23,277
Can you take this
to the finals?

1227
01:07:25,045 --> 01:07:26,581
I think me and Chango
can do anything.

1228
01:07:27,682 --> 01:07:28,716
Me too.

1229
01:07:39,694 --> 01:07:42,129
Is that the horse you got
from the Lost and Found?

1230
01:07:43,031 --> 01:07:44,364
Good luck with that.

1231
01:07:49,503 --> 01:07:50,470
Nice girl.

1232
01:08:26,808 --> 01:08:27,742
Hey, boss.

1233
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:29,978
Hey, yeah, it's me.

1234
01:08:30,078 --> 01:08:32,346
Hey uh, I got news.

1235
01:08:32,446 --> 01:08:33,948
Mmhmm.

1236
01:08:34,048 --> 01:08:35,215
You remember that horse,

1237
01:08:35,315 --> 01:08:37,117
that little pony that
went missing a while back?

1238
01:08:38,019 --> 01:08:39,020
Yeah.

1239
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:40,888
Yeah, well, I think
I just found him.

1240
01:08:40,989 --> 01:08:42,122
Uh-huh.

1241
01:08:43,256 --> 01:08:44,626
Well, I'm sitting here
looking right at it.

1242
01:08:46,661 --> 01:08:47,629
On my way to rodeo.

1243
01:08:48,696 --> 01:08:49,998
Yeah.

1244
01:08:50,098 --> 01:08:51,498
Yeah.

1245
01:08:51,599 --> 01:08:54,267
I thought you'd come over here
and take a look for yourself.

1246
01:08:54,368 --> 01:08:55,302
You bet.

1247
01:09:01,776 --> 01:09:02,810
Hey, Zach.

1248
01:09:03,845 --> 01:09:05,613
Thanks again for getting me
out of trouble.

1249
01:09:05,713 --> 01:09:07,347
Not many people
would have done that.

1250
01:09:07,447 --> 01:09:09,117
It's the right thing.
I know you didn't cheat.

1251
01:09:09,216 --> 01:09:10,618
Never doubted?

1252
01:09:10,718 --> 01:09:12,152
Never.

1253
01:09:12,252 --> 01:09:14,354
I think you're pretty awesome.

1254
01:09:14,454 --> 01:09:16,456
Charlie, I've always thought
you were pretty awesome.

1255
01:09:24,498 --> 01:09:25,933
Yeah, and then like,
Madison was just like,

1256
01:09:26,034 --> 01:09:27,101
"Good luck with that."

1257
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,502
-Really?
-Yeah.

1258
01:09:28,603 --> 01:09:29,871
-Come on.
-That's typical Madison.

1259
01:09:29,971 --> 01:09:31,438
-That's so-- that's so dumb.
-Yeah.

1260
01:09:32,406 --> 01:09:34,307
Hey! Let go of my horse!

1261
01:09:34,408 --> 01:09:36,711
Hey! What's going on?

1262
01:09:36,811 --> 01:09:39,346
We seem to have confusion here.
This horse belongs to me.

1263
01:09:39,446 --> 01:09:41,149
No, you're wrong.
Chango's ours.

1264
01:09:41,248 --> 01:09:42,215
Mac? What's going on?

1265
01:09:42,315 --> 01:09:44,251
Sorry, Clint,
but it all checks out.

1266
01:09:44,351 --> 01:09:46,154
Mr. Buchanan owns the horse.

1267
01:09:46,253 --> 01:09:47,655
No, you're-- you're lying.

1268
01:09:47,755 --> 01:09:48,488
We found him ages ago.

1269
01:09:48,589 --> 01:09:50,323
We put up flyers
and nobody came.

1270
01:09:50,424 --> 01:09:52,225
Doesn't matter.
He's mine now.

1271
01:09:52,325 --> 01:09:54,227
You lost him
and didn't even look for him.

1272
01:09:54,327 --> 01:09:56,263
You only care now, because we
placed in the barrels.

1273
01:09:56,363 --> 01:09:57,497
Maybe we can talk about this.

1274
01:09:57,598 --> 01:09:59,199
We could buy him off you
fair and square.

1275
01:09:59,299 --> 01:10:00,868
Nothing to talk about.

1276
01:10:00,968 --> 01:10:02,402
At least,
let her finish the rodeo.

1277
01:10:02,502 --> 01:10:03,938
She's in the finals on Sunday.

1278
01:10:04,038 --> 01:10:05,640
Not my problem.

1279
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:06,808
Mac?

1280
01:10:06,908 --> 01:10:09,276
Sorry, man. Nothing I can do.

1281
01:10:09,376 --> 01:10:10,645
Step aside, son.

1282
01:10:22,023 --> 01:10:23,323
We'll figure something out.

1283
01:10:45,113 --> 01:10:46,614
Charlie, you've got
to eat something.

1284
01:10:46,714 --> 01:10:47,882
I'm not hungry.

1285
01:10:47,982 --> 01:10:50,618
Look, I know this is tough,
but we'll get through this.

1286
01:10:50,718 --> 01:10:52,687
You never wanted me
to have him anyway.

1287
01:10:54,555 --> 01:10:57,257
Charlie, none of us wanted you
to lose that horse.

1288
01:10:57,357 --> 01:10:58,693
Trust me on that one.

1289
01:11:09,837 --> 01:11:11,038
I'm done with trust.

1290
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:20,715
Never thought I'd say this,

1291
01:11:20,815 --> 01:11:22,617
but we've got to get
that horse back.

1292
01:11:34,529 --> 01:11:36,631
We need to talk.

1293
01:11:40,367 --> 01:11:43,370
Why should I care about
anything you have to say?

1294
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:47,542
You used that horse
to get close to my family!

1295
01:11:47,642 --> 01:11:50,211
You're the one who told Charlie
she could have a horse.

1296
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:52,246
You can't blame me
or Chango for this.

1297
01:11:52,345 --> 01:11:54,282
I'm really pissed
at you right now.

1298
01:11:54,381 --> 01:11:55,683
Yeah, I get it.

1299
01:11:55,783 --> 01:11:57,518
Anger is a lot easier
to handle than grief.

1300
01:11:57,618 --> 01:11:59,720
You don't know what it's like
to be me.

1301
01:12:15,368 --> 01:12:18,105
All I know is Charlie needs us

1302
01:12:18,206 --> 01:12:20,074
to work together.

1303
01:12:20,174 --> 01:12:23,110
It's the difference about doing
the right thing or--

1304
01:12:23,211 --> 01:12:24,545
or the easy thing.

1305
01:12:37,658 --> 01:12:39,492
She's really good, isn't she?

1306
01:12:41,729 --> 01:12:42,763
Yeah.

1307
01:12:44,065 --> 01:12:45,566
She really is.

1308
01:12:47,969 --> 01:12:49,436
Oh, God.

1309
01:12:50,938 --> 01:12:53,941
Sometimes, man,
sometimes I feel like...

1310
01:12:55,475 --> 01:12:57,011
I really messed up.

1311
01:12:59,814 --> 01:13:02,984
But I-- I look at her
and uh...

1312
01:13:04,685 --> 01:13:06,621
And I feel like
I did pretty good, right?

1313
01:13:07,989 --> 01:13:09,422
Yeah.

1314
01:13:10,457 --> 01:13:12,093
You really did.

1315
01:13:12,193 --> 01:13:13,393
You both did.

1316
01:13:15,196 --> 01:13:16,496
She's a good girl.

1317
01:13:17,765 --> 01:13:19,567
Yeah.

1318
01:13:19,667 --> 01:13:21,569
And um...

1319
01:13:21,669 --> 01:13:23,905
I'm-- I'm sorry
I should have come to you

1320
01:13:24,005 --> 01:13:25,006
-and I should have like--
-You know what?

1321
01:13:25,106 --> 01:13:26,107
Man to man...

1322
01:13:26,207 --> 01:13:28,075
Yeah.

1323
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:31,078
You've been a good friend
to me.

1324
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:33,781
You have.

1325
01:13:34,715 --> 01:13:38,152
Just uh, treat her good, okay?

1326
01:13:52,566 --> 01:13:54,268
What are we doing here?

1327
01:13:54,368 --> 01:13:55,803
Something you need to see.

1328
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:01,309
Why is dad here?

1329
01:14:01,409 --> 01:14:02,677
Go ask him.

1330
01:14:15,122 --> 01:14:16,456
What's going on?

1331
01:14:22,797 --> 01:14:25,933
So, how exactly did you two
manage to pull this one off?

1332
01:14:26,033 --> 01:14:27,935
We took a page out of
your playbook.

1333
01:14:28,035 --> 01:14:31,072
And we made Buchanan
an offer he couldn't refuse.

1334
01:14:31,172 --> 01:14:31,973
So, you threatened him?

1335
01:14:32,073 --> 01:14:33,507
-What! No.
-No.

1336
01:14:33,607 --> 01:14:35,242
What kind of people
you think we are?

1337
01:14:35,343 --> 01:14:37,812
Bitsy, I mean Beth. Beth.

1338
01:14:37,912 --> 01:14:40,081
When Troy found out who
we were dealing with,

1339
01:14:40,181 --> 01:14:41,549
he had heard the name before.

1340
01:14:41,649 --> 01:14:43,551
Not just heard.

1341
01:14:43,651 --> 01:14:46,420
Turns out this dude's got
a really bad reputation

1342
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,356
for some pretty shady
business practices.

1343
01:14:48,456 --> 01:14:49,557
You know what I mean?

1344
01:14:49,657 --> 01:14:51,726
Troy says that Buchanan
works construction.

1345
01:14:51,826 --> 01:14:55,863
Likes to cut corners and a lot
of other illegal activities.

1346
01:14:55,963 --> 01:14:58,799
Yup. And I was on the receiving
end of a couple of those.

1347
01:15:00,034 --> 01:15:02,703
Yeah. 'Course he didn't want
to sell us Chango at first.

1348
01:15:02,803 --> 01:15:03,738
But...

1349
01:15:04,772 --> 01:15:06,841
I told him it would be
a damn shame

1350
01:15:06,941 --> 01:15:09,944
if word got out about
how he does business.

1351
01:15:10,044 --> 01:15:11,779
'Specially to the State
Licensing Board.

1352
01:15:11,879 --> 01:15:14,382
That was a good one.

1353
01:15:14,482 --> 01:15:16,283
It's weird how loss of income

1354
01:15:16,384 --> 01:15:19,420
and uh, threat of prison can
change a man's heart, you know.

1355
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,722
Yeah. Started to see the light.

1356
01:15:21,822 --> 01:15:24,792
Start to see things our way and
let us buy the horse.

1357
01:15:27,695 --> 01:15:31,198
Anyways, he finally decided
to sell us the horse.

1358
01:15:31,298 --> 01:15:32,533
Seriously?

1359
01:15:32,633 --> 01:15:34,301
How did you two do it?

1360
01:15:34,402 --> 01:15:36,037
Well, it's not impossible
for us

1361
01:15:36,137 --> 01:15:38,439
to uh, work together, right?

1362
01:15:38,539 --> 01:15:39,607
You know this horse came

1363
01:15:39,707 --> 01:15:41,842
into our lives
right when we needed him.

1364
01:15:41,942 --> 01:15:45,112
It's a God-given thing the way
he brought us all closer.

1365
01:15:45,212 --> 01:15:46,580
Healed us.

1366
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:48,482
Hey, Charlie,

1367
01:15:48,582 --> 01:15:50,184
I'm really sorry
I missed your ride.

1368
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,255
From now on,
I'm keeping my promises.

1369
01:15:54,355 --> 01:15:56,357
To both of you guys.

1370
01:15:56,457 --> 01:15:59,760
Speaking of riding,
you and your horse are

1371
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:01,128
in the finals tomorrow?

1372
01:16:02,096 --> 01:16:04,432
Well, but he's not my horse
anymore.

1373
01:16:04,533 --> 01:16:06,133
He's yours.

1374
01:16:06,233 --> 01:16:09,336
Only thing is, we just happen
to have him for sale.

1375
01:16:09,437 --> 01:16:11,939
For the very fine price
of $300.

1376
01:16:12,039 --> 01:16:14,075
But we're only accepting
payment in coins.

1377
01:16:14,175 --> 01:16:17,044
You don't happen to know
any prospective buyers, do you?

1378
01:16:17,144 --> 01:16:18,345
I'll be right back.

1379
01:16:28,489 --> 01:16:29,924
You've been carrying that
around with you?

1380
01:16:30,024 --> 01:16:31,225
All this time?

1381
01:16:31,325 --> 01:16:33,160
Well, you know what they say?

1382
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:34,361
What's that?

1383
01:16:34,462 --> 01:16:36,764
Luck is when opportunity
meets preparation.

1384
01:16:37,898 --> 01:16:39,967
I like the sound of that.
That's pretty catchy.

1385
01:16:41,302 --> 01:16:43,204
Deal!

1386
01:16:43,304 --> 01:16:45,005
Whoa. Hold on a second?

1387
01:16:48,142 --> 01:16:50,044
You're gonna need this
for your feed.

1388
01:16:50,144 --> 01:16:51,679
But I get a lucky penny.

1389
01:17:33,888 --> 01:17:36,190
And now, cowboys and cowgirls.

1390
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:39,561
we are ready for the last event
of the day,

1391
01:17:39,693 --> 01:17:43,063
the Girls Barrel Racing Finals.

1392
01:17:43,164 --> 01:17:44,365
I'm nervous.

1393
01:17:44,465 --> 01:17:45,600
You stay here with Mikey.

1394
01:17:45,699 --> 01:17:47,434
I'm gonna go find Clint
and check on Charlie.

1395
01:17:47,536 --> 01:17:48,702
Yeah. Hey, hey, we got this.

1396
01:17:48,802 --> 01:17:49,904
We can hold the fort,
right, kiddo?

1397
01:17:50,004 --> 01:17:52,072
Yeah, mom. You can trust us.

1398
01:17:53,407 --> 01:17:55,075
-I'm hungry.
-Yes, I'm hungry,

1399
01:17:55,176 --> 01:17:56,677
-You wanna get a snack?
-We gotta get some food.

1400
01:17:56,777 --> 01:17:57,945
-Yeah, let's do it.
-Yeah. Come on, let's go.

1401
01:17:58,045 --> 01:17:59,280
Come on.

1402
01:18:03,618 --> 01:18:05,753
Hope you enjoyed
your beginner's luck.

1403
01:18:05,853 --> 01:18:07,288
Too bad that's all it was.

1404
01:18:09,723 --> 01:18:10,925
You know, Madison,

1405
01:18:11,025 --> 01:18:13,227
they say people like you
are miserable inside,

1406
01:18:13,327 --> 01:18:16,665
and personally, I'm too happy of
a person to play that game.

1407
01:18:16,764 --> 01:18:18,567
I hope you find a way
to be happy.

1408
01:18:18,667 --> 01:18:20,100
Our next competitor

1409
01:18:20,201 --> 01:18:24,138
is a name that you've all heard
before here at the finals,

1410
01:18:24,238 --> 01:18:25,172
Madison Farnsworth.

1411
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:28,375
Time for me to show you

1433
01:19:30,170 --> 01:19:31,805
I wouldn't know what
a real date is.
