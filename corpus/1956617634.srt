(muffled chattering)

00:01:03,728 --> 00:01:05,839
♪ Here we go ♪

8
00:01:05,839 --> 00:01:09,339
♪ Here we are, here we go ♪

9
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,674
- [Man] Raise it up.

10
00:01:20,674 --> 00:01:21,507
Easy.

11
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:37,712
(muffled shouting)

12
00:01:41,206 --> 00:01:43,077
- Watch it.
- Over here.

13
00:01:43,077 --> 00:01:44,577
- [Man] Steady it.

(chattering)

19
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:58,490
- [Reporter] Captain Swaggert can you

20
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:00,100
give us a statement please?

21
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,933
- Not now.

22
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:02,170
- [Reporter] Can you tell
us what you found here?

23
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,357
- Do you want to move the
line back a ways Captain?

24
00:03:04,357 --> 00:03:05,640
- [Swaggert] Can't make 'em go away Jimmy.

25
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,210
- [Jimmy] I'd just as
soon turn a hose on 'em.

26
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,910
- [Swaggert] No need for
that tonight is there?

27
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,963
- Captain.
- Sam what do you got?

28
00:03:09,963 --> 00:03:11,360
- [Sam] We've checked with every

29
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,730
hospital and lab in the area.

30
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,130
There ain't no record of any
dumping or disposal like this.

31
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:15,963
- [Swaggert] Who found it?

32
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:18,750
- [Sam] A couple of kids
sportsing around near the pipe.

33
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,583
- Well don't let 'em get away

34
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,000
before we get a chance to interview 'em.

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,250
- Yep.
- Thank you, Sam.

36
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,190
Morning gentlemen.

37
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:30,843
- Howdy Captain.

38
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,190
Must be serious when
they get you out of bed.

39
00:03:37,154 --> 00:03:40,154
(suspenseful music)

40
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,230
- Did all of these come
out of that same bag?

41
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,310
- Yes sir, all but the one the kids found.

42
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,623
- So it wasn't sealed up?

43
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,343
- Not quite.

44
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,280
- Jimmy you better call my home,

45
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,730
tell Helen I probably
won't get back before dawn.

46
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,326
(ominous music)

47
00:04:13,935 --> 00:04:15,490
- [Man On Radio] It looks
like we can expect more rain

48
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,669
for the rest of the day and things

49
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:18,174
will be cleared up by late tonight.

50
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,043
So don't forget your
umbrellas on the way out.

51
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:22,320
Looks like the forecast for tomorrow,

52
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,270
it's partly cloudy skies
and clearing hot and humid.

53
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,650
Temperatures should be up
in the 90s. (chuckling)

54
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,673
Sounds like a good day to stay inside

55
00:04:28,673 --> 00:04:30,933
with the air conditioner on.

56
00:04:47,035 --> 00:04:48,543
- Hey Jim.
- Morning Captain.

57
00:04:48,543 --> 00:04:49,743
- Morning boys.

58
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,680
Belvin.
- Sir?

59
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,900
- I want the whole forensics
team in here this morning.

60
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,930
- Well Vince just got back
from the examiner's office.

61
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,580
He's gonna hold the night shift over

62
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,590
until Frankie and Scolia get down.

63
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,423
- Good deal.

64
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,260
Foot, I want you to
coordinate two diver teams

65
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,150
on standby and make sure damn they know

66
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,800
what they're getting into down there.

67
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,633
- Yes sir.

68
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:13,603
Six feet of rapidly moving excrement.

69
00:05:13,603 --> 00:05:14,720
(chuckling)
(phone ringing)

70
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,317
- Get that for me would you?

71
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,660
- What if this rain keeps up Captain?

72
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,610
- [Belvin] Well we're gonna
have to start building an ark.

73
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,140
- Yeah but who do we put on it?

74
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,290
- All the white people.

75
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,900
- It's Pete Sweeny, channel six.

76
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,050
He wants to know about
the numbers on the hands.

77
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,430
- Well you tell him they have to wait

78
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,520
for a press release like everyone else.

79
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,750
- Did you hear that Pete?

80
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,050
Yeah just call back later.

81
00:05:36,914 --> 00:05:37,940
- What else did he want?

82
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,010
- Just smelling around for more news.

83
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,600
- Speaking of news, I got
an announcement for you.

84
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,750
The assistance chief has called in

85
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,760
an outside profiler on this one.

86
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,420
- What FBI?

87
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,963
- No, state crime division.

88
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,860
- Lesser of two evils.

89
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,240
- She'll be coming in here sometime today.

90
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,393
- Whoa, she?

91
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,360
- Special investigator Audrey L. Macleah,

92
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,640
all the way from Austin.

93
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,290
- And what's so special about her?

94
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,289
- Oh, she's a state trooper man.

95
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:07,850
You know what it takes
to crack that boys' club?

96
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,840
- Yeah, you gotta have
a mustache and no neck.

97
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,115
- You mean she looks just like you.

98
00:06:12,115 --> 00:06:13,390
(chuckling)

99
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,780
- What's she gonna do around here anyway,

100
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,340
except look over our shoulder?

101
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,640
- She's gonna save us from ourselves.

102
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,920
- Suspect profiling, computer modeling,

103
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,830
victimology, databased
analysis, forensics,

104
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,620
trace evidence, chemical
evidence retrieval,

105
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,360
blood pattern analysis.

106
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,450
Y'all want to hear more?

107
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,960
- Yeah, but can she tie her own shoelaces?

108
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,960
- Sounds like she don't have the time.

109
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,254
- Sounds like she wears boots.

110
00:06:39,254 --> 00:06:41,504
(laughing)

111
00:06:43,965 --> 00:06:45,380
(knocking)

112
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,600
Come in.

113
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,690
- Captain Swaggert?

114
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,660
- Yeah.

115
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,010
- I'm investigator Macleah.

116
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,360
- You boys get out of here,
I got some work to do.

117
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,360
Nice to meet you Miss Macleah.

118
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,724
- Nice to meet you.

119
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:12,800
- May I help you with your bags?

120
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,313
- Oh no, that's okay, I got it.

121
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,640
I know I'm running a
little behind schedule.

122
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,750
I was going to rent a
car, but they didn't have

123
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,880
the model that I wanted
so I took a cab instead.

124
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,030
Which actually probably
saved me a lot of time

125
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,640
since the traffic out there only seems

126
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,970
to be getting worsened.

127
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,800
Cab drivers usually know of shortcuts,

128
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,577
but I think this guy took the long way.

129
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:32,410
It was okay.

130
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,080
I'll pick up a car later
when we're done here.

131
00:07:37,568 --> 00:07:39,850
- Do you want some coffee or something?

132
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,590
- Do you have any tea?

133
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,423
- Tea?

134
00:07:42,423 --> 00:07:45,413
- Yes, earl gray, Twinings,
english breakfast?

135
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,701
- Have a seat will you?

136
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,034
- Oh, thank you.

137
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,630
- Darlene could you fix a cup of tea

138
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,453
and bring it to my office please?

139
00:07:56,453 --> 00:07:57,823
- [Darlene] Did you say tea Captain?

140
00:07:57,823 --> 00:08:00,340
- [Swaggert] Yes I did,
don't you have any?

141
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,580
- [Darlene] I think we have Lipton's.

142
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,320
- How's Lipton's?
- Oh that's fine.

143
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,597
- That's fine Darlene, thank you.

144
00:08:06,546 --> 00:08:09,757
(clearing throat)

145
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:13,762
So how long have you worked
for the state division?

146
00:08:13,762 --> 00:08:16,098
- A little over four years.

147
00:08:16,098 --> 00:08:18,890
- And how do you like it?
- I like it very much.

148
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,840
Is it alright if I smoke?
- Be my guest.

149
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,320
- Would you care for one?
- No thanks, I quit.

150
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,320
- I'm working on it.

151
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,150
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

152
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,393
- And I understand that
your specialty is profiling?

153
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,333
- Yes sir.

154
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,440
Actually we have to call it
suspect analysis these days

155
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,370
because of the big flack with

156
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,760
psychiatrists a year or so back.

157
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,510
I guess they thought we were
encroaching on their turf.

158
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,070
Interesting how a single word can be

159
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,120
that threatening to an entire occupation.

160
00:08:55,363 --> 00:08:58,340
- And you use computers quite a lot?

161
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,450
- Yes sir, we take a victimology matrix

162
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,080
and superimpose it over
a hypothetical framework.

163
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,520
A suspect behavior constructed
on a computer database

164
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,530
and then we look for intersecting

165
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,003
modes to reinforce the model.

166
00:09:13,717 --> 00:09:16,260
(laughing)

167
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,460
If you would like I could have

168
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,060
the Austin office fax you my resume.

169
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,010
- They already did.

170
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:25,904
(clearing throat)

171
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:30,400
So you were a year with
the FBI in Quantico.

172
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,903
- Yes, profiling, victimology
classes, that sort of thing.

173
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,050
- And three years on the road?

174
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,560
- Mm-hm.
- What was that like?

175
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,270
- Slow, but it was the only way

176
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,670
to get to where I am now so.

177
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,730
- Bachelors in political
science, med school,

178
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,440
masters in psychology.

179
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,361
- I guess when I was younger

180
00:09:50,361 --> 00:09:52,050
I thought I was gonna save the world.

181
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,183
Another Albert Schweitzer
or something like that.

182
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,910
- What made you change your mind?

183
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,330
- I didn't like the pain
that I saw everywhere.

184
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,100
Actually I suppose that's
what got me into this,

185
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,350
but I didn't want that
kind of responsibility.

186
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,250
- What kind of responsibility is that?

187
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,043
- Healing.

188
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,780
- [Swaggert] Tell me did your
office brief you on this case?

189
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,130
- No sir, they told me
that you would do that.

190
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,173
- Why don't we take a walk down the hall?

191
00:10:25,586 --> 00:10:28,503
(unsettling music)

192
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,160
- Now we have several specimens.

193
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,793
Four right, three left, one likely pair.

194
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,690
According to the numbers in the palms

195
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:51,183
we have a broken series from two to 13.

196
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,190
- What is the age range of the victims?

197
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,180
- Well we haven't run any tests yet,

198
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,863
but judging from the size they're young.

199
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,791
- Very young.
- Looks that way.

200
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:06,291
(camera shutter snapping)

201
00:11:09,162 --> 00:11:14,162
Subcutaneous, fascia, veins,
arteries, musculature,

202
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:18,220
all severed cleanly
with a very sharp blade.

203
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,133
This is not some gorilla
with a meat clever.

204
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,703
- This is Sergeant Footman.
- Morning.

205
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,100
- Sergeant Belvin.
- Howdy.

206
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,340
- There's Lieutenant Creedmore.

207
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,640
Jimmy's my right hand man.

208
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,930
There's Vince from forensics,
y'all have already met.

209
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:42,880
This is Sergeant Delarand.

210
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,513
The sergeant is our
resident computer guru.

211
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,753
- Pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

212
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,030
- You may sit over there Miss Macleah.

213
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,760
Alberto, would you kindly
pull those shades for me?

214
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,600
- I'll get these here.
- Thank you Footman.

215
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,737
Also turn off the lights if you would.

216
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,980
(clearing throat)

217
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,380
Now then I know I don't have to say this,

218
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,980
but just for the record I don't want you

219
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,090
talking with your family
or friends about this case

220
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,240
or with anyone outside the department

221
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,780
staff assigned to the case.

222
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,510
As you well know there's
a whole lot of anxiety

223
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,610
in the community, people
are scared as hell.

224
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,060
So just keep your mouth shut.

225
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,900
- Each victim was Caucasian.

226
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,820
There are no blemishes
and no malformations

227
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,253
and no birth marks.

228
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:37,290
Now the numbers have been
tattooed on with imperishable ink.

229
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:42,057
And we found traces of formalin
in each of the specimens.

230
00:12:42,057 --> 00:12:44,803
Now that would explain why
they're so well preserved.

231
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,170
Now these tiny punctures you see here

232
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,633
and here all the way around.

233
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:55,320
Those are suture marks
and each specimen has them

234
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,323
which would suggest they've all
been severed and reattached.

235
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,240
- What about age Vince?

236
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,270
- Well there does seem
to be a relationship

237
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,550
between the numbers on the palms

238
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,870
and the probable age of the victim.

239
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,710
- [Belvin] So the lower the
number the younger the victim?

240
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,810
- That's right.

241
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:18,200
I'm guessing we're looking
at about five years of age

242
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,420
for the smallest specimen

243
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,263
and about 10 to 12 for the largest.

244
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,230
- Excuse me.
- Miss Macleah?

245
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,450
- Yes, I have a question.

246
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,470
I was just wondering about what efforts

247
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,330
were made to identify the victims?

248
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,810
- Well we fingerprinted
each one of the specimens

249
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:38,800
of course, but if the hands
all come from children

250
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,950
it's not likely we're gonna get

251
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,670
a match doing an optical bank.

252
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,700
- We requested birth certificates

253
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,900
for local missing children,

254
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,780
but there's no fast way to
match out the hand prints.

255
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,420
It'll probably take weeks to
get through what comes in.

256
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,460
- Well what about DNA fingerprinting?

257
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,540
- Well what would be the point?

258
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,020
We don't have any samples to match to.

259
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,150
- Well what about the
parents of missing children?

260
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,930
- We've already pulLed the national

261
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,290
MP list into our database.

262
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,550
That's over 2,000 names.

263
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,913
- And each one of those would

264
00:14:03,913 --> 00:14:07,710
have to be cross indexed one at a time.

265
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:10,730
The only rapid search we
could run is our local list.

266
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,600
- So why not take samples from that?

267
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,470
- We don't know yet if the
victims are only local.

268
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,650
- And we'd have the families
of every missing persons case

269
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,640
from the last 10 years
down here on our backs.

270
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,340
- Not if you reduce the list of candidates

271
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,890
to those matching the
specimens for age and gender.

272
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:31,650
- Miss Macleah you are talking
about contacting parents

273
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:34,460
who are wondering if their
children are still alive

274
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,450
and asking them to come
down here for a blood test.

275
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,630
They're gonna want to know why?

276
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,730
What do we tell them?

277
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,840
- We tell them that we have remains

278
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,200
which need to be identified.

279
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,530
- They already know about the hands.

280
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,020
- See it really doesn't
matter what we tell them

281
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,910
after we make that call
because they're gonna be

282
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,870
so frightened that it is their child

283
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,120
they're not gonna be able
to think of anything else

284
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,070
and if you multiply that
fear by several hundred

285
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,070
we would have a situation here
that we could hardly control.

286
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,760
- Well it seems to me that
you don't have a crime scene

287
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,630
and you don't have any
identifiable remains

288
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,380
unless you make some assumptions.

289
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,340
Now in order to go forward and profile

290
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,030
a suspect you need a victimology.

291
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,020
I mean without that as a base

292
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,773
you really don't have anything do you?

293
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,630
- Yes, well now that the rain has let up

294
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,250
I expect we're gonna find the
rest of the victims' remains

295
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,950
in the sewers in the next few days

296
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,500
and that is our top priority right now.

297
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,610
- Yes, but if all the victims' remains

298
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,870
were thrown into the sewer
pipe at the same time

299
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,590
they can be scattered
all over the city by now

300
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,690
and why would the hands be placed in bag?

301
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,710
Maybe because the hands were

302
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,890
dumped separately from the bodies.

303
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,260
Maybe the bodies were
dumped somewhere else.

304
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,300
I mean what if those remains are

305
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,980
miles away in another sewer pipe?

306
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,583
- We won't know that unless
we look for them will we?

307
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,770
- Would you close that door please?

308
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:12,670
Y'all come on a little
stormy in there didn't you?

309
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,370
- I was just speaking my mind sir.

310
00:16:16,405 --> 00:16:18,600
- Well I guess this being
your first day and all

311
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,500
you're just a little too wound up huh?

312
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,110
- Not anymore than usual, no.

313
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,773
- Alright then.

314
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,470
In the future if you have
something to say about a directive

315
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,050
I would appreciate if you
would just say it and drop it.

316
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,950
Don't turn it into a contest, alright?

317
00:16:39,219 --> 00:16:40,052
- Yes sir.

318
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:41,903
- Good deal.

319
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,860
We got this call this
morning from a doctor

320
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:49,110
who wants to talk to someone
in person about this case.

321
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,800
Now I want to send you out on this

322
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,303
because frankly I don't have anything else

323
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,870
for you to do around here.

324
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,747
You got a problem with that?

325
00:16:55,747 --> 00:16:56,580
- No sir.

326
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,703
- Alright.

327
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,633
Do you know where the state
psychiatric hospital is?

328
00:17:02,633 --> 00:17:07,633
(train whistle blowing)
(crossing bell dinging)

329
00:17:14,252 --> 00:17:18,335
(muffled talking on loudspeaker)

330
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,973
- Can you tell me where
Dr. Singer's office is?

331
00:17:22,973 --> 00:17:23,806
Thank you.

332
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,098
- Dr. Willis, line two.
(phone ringing)

333
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:30,431
Dr. Willis, line two please.

334
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:34,928
(chattering)

335
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,200
Dr. Singer?
- Yes.

336
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,300
- I'm investigator Macleah.

337
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,100
I'm working with the Houston police.

338
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,840
- I'm a little surprised.

339
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,370
I didn't expect someone so quickly.

340
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,710
- You did ask to speak to the police?

341
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:13,166
- Yes, but I've been hesitant about this

342
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,563
because of case confidentiality.

343
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,373
Because there's no way to fully explain

344
00:18:18,373 --> 00:18:20,283
the situation on the phone.

345
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:25,290
I need an answer to a question.

346
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,730
- Go ahead.

347
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,350
- The hands that you found.
- Mm-hm?

348
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,330
- The police said that there
were numbers on the palms?

349
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,670
- That's correct.

350
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,483
- Are these numbers in
a series from one to 18?

351
00:18:36,338 --> 00:18:37,171
(unsettling music)

352
00:18:37,171 --> 00:18:38,840
We have a young boy in seclusion

353
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,720
who's been here since he
was four or five years old.

354
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,260
He was passed from the adoption agency

355
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,883
to the state foster program
and well then to us.

356
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:52,500
He has seizure states
which are very violent.

357
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,910
And one of the traits is
bleeding from the wrist

358
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:58,020
all way around like an incision.

359
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,010
At first we thought
they were self induced,

360
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,970
but we searched his cell

361
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,850
and we've never been able to find anything

362
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,650
that could create such a wound.

363
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,800
Watch your step please.

364
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,500
For some years now along with the seizures

365
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,723
he's been drawing hands on
the wall of his cell in pairs.

366
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,080
And each new pair of hands that he draws

367
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,079
has a different pair of numbers.

368
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:21,912
Good morning Danny.

369
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:24,750
Would you let us in please?

370
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,770
- How many patients are down here?

371
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:27,603
- Just one.

372
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:29,999
Thank you.

373
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:30,832
Right this way.

374
00:19:31,831 --> 00:19:34,831
(suspenseful music)

375
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,923
This used to be our isolation ward.

376
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,103
When we built a new wing we
moved most of the patients out.

377
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,370
- Why is he still down here?

378
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,870
- This is his home.

379
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,793
This way.

380
00:20:01,503 --> 00:20:02,693
Good morning Jordan.

381
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,930
You have a special visitor this morning.

382
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,230
She came just to meet you.

383
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,533
Danny.

384
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,660
This is Miss Macleah.

385
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,110
- Nice to meet you Jordan.

386
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,740
I would like to take a
few photos if I might?

387
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,573
- Sure.

388
00:20:39,507 --> 00:20:43,007
(camera shutter snapping)

389
00:20:56,957 --> 00:20:58,360
- Thank you.

390
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,510
- Danny why don't you take Jordan

391
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,750
to get a clean set of greens.

392
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,000
- [Danny] Okay.

393
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,030
- Where are the hands drawn?

394
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:13,863
- Here.

395
00:21:16,322 --> 00:21:19,239
(unsettling music)

396
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,970
Did all of them appear at once?

397
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,993
- He's drawn them a pair at a
time over the last 10 years.

398
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,440
We repainted the cell once

399
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,260
but he just scratched them back in again.

400
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,960
- They were drawn in sequential order?

401
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,150
- Yeah.

402
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,630
Each pair was drawn on
the same date each year,

403
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:50,380
July 16th, his birthday.

404
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,210
- Has he ever been released?

405
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,293
- Not since he was admitted.
- And when was that?

406
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,607
- About 10 years ago.

407
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,060
- Has he ever spoken to
you about these drawings?

408
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,060
- He hasn't spoken since he's been here.

409
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,780
He was diagnosed as an elective mute

410
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,480
when he was five or six years old.

411
00:22:11,582 --> 00:22:14,499
(unsettling music)

412
00:23:17,449 --> 00:23:20,532
(electronic buzzing)

413
00:24:22,659 --> 00:24:26,242
(Jordan humming musically)

414
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,798
- Good morning Jordan.

415
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:47,381
(Jordan humming musically)

416
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,840
Jordan I'd like to talk to you

417
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,870
about the drawings on the wall.

418
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:42,113
I'd like to find out more about them.

419
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:46,680
I brought some crayons and some paper

420
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,040
and I thought that maybe
if I had a question

421
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,240
you could write down your answers for me?

422
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,353
How does that sound?

423
00:25:53,514 --> 00:25:55,681
(farting)

424
00:26:24,534 --> 00:26:26,867
(screaming)

425
00:26:30,807 --> 00:26:34,710
- He don't like anybody
to touch his doll ma'am.

426
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,433
- Could you leave the room for a moment?

427
00:26:41,383 --> 00:26:43,633
(grunting)

428
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,543
Let's stop pretending for a moment okay?

429
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,883
We both know that you're not stupid.

430
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:11,870
Now I don't know if you
drew these hands or not,

431
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,770
but if you did you must have a reason

432
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,653
and I would like to know
what that reason is.

433
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,363
I see.

434
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,190
She does all the talking, huh?

435
00:27:54,866 --> 00:27:56,116
Goodbye Jordan.

436
00:28:05,706 --> 00:28:08,956
(door thudding closed)

437
00:28:14,478 --> 00:28:19,478
(horn honking)
(suspenseful music)

438
00:28:24,473 --> 00:28:28,640
(muffled talking on police radio)

439
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,773
- [Man] All clear here,
no sighting so far.

440
00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:40,109
- Go back to that other half.

441
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,670
Little more.

442
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,503
Good.

443
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:47,560
Easy now, very easy.

444
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,840
- Excuse me, Captain Swaggert.

445
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,374
- Good.
- Morning Miss Macleah.

446
00:28:50,374 --> 00:28:51,207
- Morning.

447
00:28:51,207 --> 00:28:52,810
- [Man] I think we might have something.

448
00:28:54,648 --> 00:28:57,648
(suspenseful music)

449
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,380
- How deep is the water there?

450
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,280
- [Man] Good money says about 10 feet.

451
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,987
Park it right there for a minute.

452
00:29:11,987 --> 00:29:14,090
- May I speak with you for a moment?

453
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,270
- Sure thing.

454
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,843
Alright boys we're coming
in to see what you found.

455
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,758
- [Man] Alright, bring it up.

456
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:21,591
That's it, that's it, easy now.

457
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,860
- I've been looking over the medical files

458
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,190
for Jordan Thomas, the boy I told

459
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,240
you about from the hospital.

460
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,013
Now his birthday is July 16th,

461
00:29:28,013 --> 00:29:31,240
this is the same date every
year that he has these seizures.

462
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,087
It's also the same date
he draws the hands.

463
00:29:33,087 --> 00:29:35,330
- So what's that got to do with this case?

464
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,590
- Well seven disappearances over

465
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:39,310
the last nine years fall on July 16th.

466
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,370
Now if you put them into
a series starting 1984

467
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,850
you get a victim set which matches

468
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,700
the specimens for age and gender.

469
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,591
Seven names could be the victims.

470
00:29:47,591 --> 00:29:50,128
Now what I would like to do is
spend more time with the boy.

471
00:29:50,128 --> 00:29:51,970
I think he may be able to help us.

472
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,920
- Well look if you got
a list of names to go on

473
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,050
why don't you focus on that

474
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:57,210
'cause I need a profile as
fast as you can build one.

475
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:00,590
- Yeah I know that sir, but
the names are only speculative.

476
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,740
There's no positive ID.

477
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,580
There's no certainty unless

478
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,580
you're able to find something down here.

479
00:30:07,303 --> 00:30:11,053
(suspenseful dramatic music)

480
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,127
- Hey are you alright?

481
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,600
- Yeah, I'm a little dizzy that's all.

482
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,807
I think I need to get some air.

483
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,230
- Alright, I better walk you back.

484
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,712
- No, just give me some room.

485
00:30:25,712 --> 00:30:26,795
I'll be fine.

486
00:30:28,692 --> 00:30:29,525
- Let me help you.

487
00:30:29,525 --> 00:30:30,623
- Don't touch me please.

488
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,563
I'm fine.

489
00:30:32,563 --> 00:30:33,396
I'm alright.

490
00:30:36,136 --> 00:30:39,883
I have a little trouble in
closed spaces that's all.

491
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:42,231
I'm okay.

492
00:30:45,649 --> 00:30:47,184
- I understand.

493
00:30:47,184 --> 00:30:49,264
Just take it easy now.
- I'm fine.

494
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,514
- [Jimmy On Radio] Captain?

495
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,501
- What is it Jimmy?

496
00:30:54,501 --> 00:30:55,334
- [Jimmy On Radio] It's a false alarm.

497
00:30:55,334 --> 00:30:57,644
They pulled up a mannequin.

498
00:30:57,644 --> 00:30:58,789
- [Swaggert] Say again?

499
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:01,316
- [Jimmy On Radio] They
netted a goddamn mannequin.

500
00:31:01,316 --> 00:31:02,149
- 10 four.

501
00:31:15,727 --> 00:31:18,560
(muffled talking)

502
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:23,759
(dramatic suspenseful music)

503
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:40,821
- I'd like to go in by myself.

504
00:32:40,821 --> 00:32:41,821
- Yes ma'am.

505
00:32:46,109 --> 00:32:49,692
(Jordan humming musically)

506
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:04,365
- Good morning Jordan.

507
00:33:04,365 --> 00:33:07,948
(Jordan humming musically)

508
00:33:11,593 --> 00:33:14,513
That's a very pretty song,
did somebody teach you that?

509
00:33:16,784 --> 00:33:20,367
(Jordan humming musically)

510
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:25,813
I thought that maybe we could start again.

511
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,113
Cute.

512
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,560
Are you enjoying yourself?

513
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,960
Alright you can stop
it now, it's not funny.

514
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,653
Listen to me, this is not a game.

515
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,090
Look, I need your help.

516
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:44,773
I need you tell me why you
keep drawing these hands.

517
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:49,173
I don't want to play anymore
games, do you understand me?

518
00:34:50,148 --> 00:34:51,580
Do you understand me?

519
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,413
(growling)

520
00:34:52,413 --> 00:34:53,246
Ouch!

521
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:56,363
We're fine.

522
00:35:04,386 --> 00:35:08,136
If you ever do that
again I'll bite you back.

523
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,013
So you can write, huh?

524
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:18,123
Again.

525
00:35:27,372 --> 00:35:28,205
Again.

526
00:35:46,084 --> 00:35:47,633
Well if this is all you have to say to me

527
00:35:47,633 --> 00:35:51,992
then I guess we have
nothing to talk about do we?

528
00:35:51,992 --> 00:35:54,617
You want to keep it,
is that what you want?

529
00:35:54,617 --> 00:35:57,537
If you want to keep it write it down.

530
00:35:57,537 --> 00:35:58,704
Write it down.

531
00:36:09,937 --> 00:36:10,770
Good.

532
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:13,837
It's a start.

533
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,261
(suspenseful music)

534
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:39,920
- This is Deanne Alberti, age five,

535
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,750
at the time of her disappearance

536
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:45,563
July 16, 1984 from Twin Pines Park.

537
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,240
This is Susan Lewins, age seven

538
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,250
at the time of her disappearance,

539
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:58,803
July 16, 1986 from Peace Park.

540
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,790
This is Janie Monahan,

541
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:06,610
age nine at the time of her disappearance,

542
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:10,483
July 16, 1989 from Lakeview Park.

543
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,670
Mary Klugman, age 10 at the
time of her disappearance,

544
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:19,493
July 16, 1990 from Eastwood Park.

545
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,650
All four of these children were identified

546
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:25,270
by DNA paternity tests.

547
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,103
Bill.

548
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,323
- Captain.

549
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:34,450
Now, all four IDed victims
were found in different parks.

550
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,970
All four of these parks are
in upscale parts of town

551
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:41,920
where the patrol watch is above normal.

552
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,710
All four victims were
abducted in broad daylight,

553
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:49,543
in front of family members
or friends, or both.

554
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:52,950
- It means our man is one slippery mother.

555
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:53,783
- Yeah.

556
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,063
- Excuse me, I have a question.

557
00:37:58,930 --> 00:37:59,900
- Miss Macleah.

558
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,220
- We are obviously dealing with someone

559
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:07,220
who is very intelligent
and very methodical.

560
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,670
He must've received some
formal medical training

561
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,763
so he's highly educated as well.

562
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,900
He's also willing to take great risks,

563
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,340
but he reduces the risk
by choosing his location

564
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,350
in advance along with his victims.

565
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:24,870
I mean he can't arbitrarily
be choosing different parks

566
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:25,990
for each of his abductions

567
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:28,447
and his victims fit a very strong pattern

568
00:38:28,447 --> 00:38:33,090
so he has to seek them out individually

569
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:34,793
so that nothing is left to chance.

570
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:40,420
Now the date of significance
to the killer is July 16th.

571
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,420
It's part of his behavioral pattern,

572
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,930
but the last abduction
that fits this pattern

573
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:47,635
was Mary Klugman, which
was three years ago.

574
00:38:47,635 --> 00:38:48,633
- Uh-huh.

575
00:38:48,633 --> 00:38:51,780
And what is your question Miss Macleah?

576
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:55,090
- Well it would seem that he
has either become inactive

577
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:57,573
or he's changed his
pattern which could mean

578
00:38:57,573 --> 00:39:00,130
a whole new set of locations and dates

579
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:03,310
and maybe even a new type of victim.

580
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:05,420
I mean he could be evolving
in ways we know nothing about.

581
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,020
- Maybe he just got spooked, you know?

582
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,160
And he just went looking in a

583
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,150
different neighborhood for his kids.

584
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:14,650
I mean if he is as smart as you say he is

585
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:17,460
then he knew that he was pushing his luck

586
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,010
with seven kids in seven years.

587
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,570
- You found the hands eight days ago.

588
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,090
Today is the 12th.

589
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:26,940
For him to dump those
hands so close to the 16th.

590
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,725
I mean that cannot be a coincidence.

591
00:39:29,725 --> 00:39:32,070
I mean it's gotta be
some kind of a signal.

592
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,783
- Maybe he's about to return
to his old hunting ground.

593
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:42,690
- Maybe we should just take
his hunting ground away.

594
00:39:45,334 --> 00:39:48,084
(birds chirping)

595
00:40:34,856 --> 00:40:37,773
(swings squeaking)

596
00:40:50,223 --> 00:40:53,500
- I know that this is very
difficult for you Mrs. Klugman,

597
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,650
but I need to ask you about that day,

598
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,830
about what you can remember.

599
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,000
- Do you have any children Miss?

600
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,833
- No.

601
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,100
- It's like your whole world just stops.

602
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:07,200
Just comes to an end.

603
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,070
- How many times do we have
to tell this story to people?

604
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:13,220
I mean what is it, you
come into our house,

605
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:16,160
you ask us the same questions

606
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,460
and you write down the same answers.

607
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,773
You just throw that away?

608
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,790
- I'm sorry that this is so hard for you.

609
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:24,813
- Oh you're sorry?

610
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:29,900
I want to know why that
thing's still out there

611
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,810
just taking kids off the street.

612
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:33,410
Why haven't you found him, huh?

613
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:34,890
Can you tell me that?

614
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:36,680
Just answer me that question.

615
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,740
- It's alright Martin.

616
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,490
If it'll help then I want to do it.

617
00:41:44,025 --> 00:41:45,025
- Thank you.

618
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,820
- She was just playing with

619
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,663
a group of friends, neighbor kids.

620
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,140
- Do you remember if there were

621
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,703
any adults nearby close to your daughter?

622
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:59,320
- The park was really crowded that day.

623
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,660
No.

624
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,810
No, she was just with her friends.

625
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:07,510
Three other kids, I knew them all.

626
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:11,690
And there were two other
mothers on a bench close to me.

627
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:15,150
I was taking care of my
neighbor's two little boys

628
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:17,360
and one of them needed
to go to the bathroom

629
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,510
so I took both of them.

630
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,503
- How far away was your
daughter from the bathroom?

631
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,960
- Maybe, I don't know, about 100 feet.

632
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,260
I'm not sure, maybe a little bit more.

633
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:34,010
- So did you go inside the
bathroom once you got there?

634
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,580
- Yes.

635
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,470
I helped both the boys.

636
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:39,250
They were both very young.

637
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,200
But I could see them from the bathroom.

638
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:44,523
- [Audrey] And how long were
you inside the bathroom?

639
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,143
- Not very long.

640
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,143
10 minutes.

641
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,660
Maybe a little bit longer.

642
00:42:56,970 --> 00:43:00,253
- Do you remember any
sounds from the park?

643
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:04,780
- Just the sound of children playing

644
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:09,690
and there might've been a radio playing

645
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:10,913
or something like that.

646
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,480
I don't even know how I heard it.

647
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,220
And then I walked out with the boys

648
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,723
and all the kids were there, but Mary.

649
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:25,070
Nobody even seemed to notice she was gone.

650
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:28,693
And the kids were all playing
like nothing had happened.

651
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,303
They were just laughing.

652
00:43:39,986 --> 00:43:42,736
(dramatic music)

653
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:06,913
- Yeah.
(chuckling)

654
00:44:06,913 --> 00:44:08,835
- And the bear says you don't just

655
00:44:08,835 --> 00:44:10,411
come here for the hunting do you?

656
00:44:10,411 --> 00:44:12,179
(laughing)

657
00:44:12,179 --> 00:44:13,333
I told you.

658
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:14,690
It's your joke.

659
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:15,523
- Excuse me.

660
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:20,730
Does anybody know what this is all about?

661
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:22,560
I found it in the reserve's drawer.

662
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,760
- Let me see that Jimmy.

663
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:26,650
Oh yeah, this.

664
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:28,760
Yeah I looked at this
till my eyes crossed.

665
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,343
- Well what's on it?

666
00:44:30,343 --> 00:44:32,410
- Well, a neighbor kid was in the park

667
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:35,170
earlier that day shooting home movies.

668
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:37,779
- The same park she was abducted from?

669
00:44:37,779 --> 00:44:39,300
- Yes.

670
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,270
Hey, it's two hours of kids' feet,

671
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:42,773
back of people's heads.

672
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,730
Made me dizzy just watching it.

673
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:49,180
- Did anybody do a frame
by frame analysis on it?

674
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:52,100
- That was three years ago.

675
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,080
- Like I said, I looked at it.

676
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,730
So did a half dozen other people.

677
00:44:59,757 --> 00:45:02,903
And now, hey, it's all yours.

678
00:45:05,362 --> 00:45:06,195
- Thanks.

679
00:45:09,343 --> 00:45:10,343
- Yes ma'am.

680
00:45:11,213 --> 00:45:14,109
(chuckling)

681
00:45:14,109 --> 00:45:18,442
(warbling slow recorded chattering)

682
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:35,765
(suspenseful music)

683
00:45:35,765 --> 00:45:40,765
(ice cream truck music)
(children chattering)

684
00:45:53,716 --> 00:45:57,351
(suspenseful music)

685
00:45:57,351 --> 00:46:00,684
(ice cream truck music)

686
00:46:03,792 --> 00:46:06,792
(suspenseful music)

687
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:32,243
(phone ringing)

688
00:46:32,243 --> 00:46:33,076
- Delarand.

689
00:46:33,076 --> 00:46:35,032
- [Audrey On Phone] Hi,
it's Audrey Macleah.

690
00:46:35,032 --> 00:46:37,168
- Hello Miss Macleah.

691
00:46:37,168 --> 00:46:38,490
What can I do for you?

692
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:39,760
- I need you to do a name search

693
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,307
for anyone holding city permits

694
00:46:41,307 --> 00:46:43,020
to sell concessions to the parks.

695
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,018
- Okay, no problem.

696
00:46:44,018 --> 00:46:45,410
I'll do it for you first
thing in the morning.

697
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:47,510
- No, I need this done right now.

698
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:49,820
Run whatever you find through
a unit for all prior arrests.

699
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:52,700
I need as much of a profile as I can get.

700
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:55,340
- Look, this could take a while.

701
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,805
I need to access a half a dozen data banks

702
00:46:57,805 --> 00:46:58,790
- [Audrey On Phone] Fine.

703
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:01,090
Fax it to my terminal when you're done.

704
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:02,023
- Yes ma'am.

705
00:47:04,187 --> 00:47:06,937
(dramatic music)

706
00:47:59,962 --> 00:48:01,045
- Looks good.

707
00:48:02,952 --> 00:48:04,369
That's very good.

708
00:48:06,473 --> 00:48:09,806
(train whistle blowing)

709
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,073
Try...

710
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:32,713
Stand up on this chair.

711
00:48:34,943 --> 00:48:35,776
Come on.

712
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,253
Now, put this in your hand.

713
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:49,513
Hold it up to the light, higher.

714
00:48:50,859 --> 00:48:51,692
Higher.

715
00:48:53,372 --> 00:48:56,173
What do you see?
(laughing)

716
00:49:02,965 --> 00:49:05,882
(unsettling music)

717
00:49:39,415 --> 00:49:42,070
- Howard Speckett this
is the Houston police.

718
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:44,180
We have a warrant to search the premises.

719
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,016
Open the door.

720
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:48,349
- Let's move.
- Move, go, go.

721
00:49:56,572 --> 00:49:57,405
(muffled talking on police radio)

722
00:49:57,405 --> 00:49:58,322
- [Man] Go.

723
00:50:01,653 --> 00:50:02,486
- Captain.

724
00:50:03,657 --> 00:50:05,855
- [Man] Bedroom's clear back here sir.

725
00:50:05,855 --> 00:50:07,938
- [Man] Bathroom's clear.

726
00:50:33,662 --> 00:50:36,579
(unsettling music)

727
00:51:32,872 --> 00:51:34,422
- I found them in the bathroom.

728
00:51:38,725 --> 00:51:40,320
- Search the premises for anything

729
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,663
sharper than a butter knife.

730
00:52:02,096 --> 00:52:05,805
- [Woman On Loudspeaker] JD,
you have a telephone call.

731
00:52:05,805 --> 00:52:09,566
- He says Speckett didn't
check back in last night.

732
00:52:09,566 --> 00:52:11,050
He's been driving a substitute van

733
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:13,800
until his regular van is fixed.

734
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:14,633
- Where's it being fixed?

735
00:52:14,633 --> 00:52:15,540
- It hasn't bene.

736
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,190
It's right down there at the end.

737
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,370
- [Swaggert] Alright, have Belvin

738
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:23,050
and Foot to check it out, will you?

739
00:52:29,707 --> 00:52:33,040
(ice cream truck music)

740
00:52:57,063 --> 00:53:02,063
(inhaler air whooshing)
(deep breathing)

741
00:53:12,466 --> 00:53:15,466
(suspenseful music)

742
00:53:23,093 --> 00:53:24,597
- Howard Speckett.

743
00:53:24,597 --> 00:53:25,430
(shouting)

744
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:27,283
(glass shattering)

745
00:53:27,283 --> 00:53:28,116
Shit.

746
00:53:28,978 --> 00:53:30,400
(suspenseful music)

747
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,817
- Over here boys!

748
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,950
You alright?

749
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:05,920
- Yeah, I couldn't see him.

750
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,180
It's too dark in here.

751
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:09,670
- Brady, move your units
around the complex.

752
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:11,483
Looks like our boy
slipped through us here.

753
00:54:11,483 --> 00:54:14,744
(sirens blaring)

754
00:54:14,744 --> 00:54:16,911
(gasping)

755
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:22,005
- [Officer] Freeze!

756
00:54:22,005 --> 00:54:23,874
Freeze dammit!

757
00:54:23,874 --> 00:54:24,843
(gun firing)

758
00:54:24,843 --> 00:54:25,676
- Ow, ow.

759
00:54:27,202 --> 00:54:28,287
- Stay right there.

760
00:54:28,287 --> 00:54:29,312
Show us your hands.

761
00:54:29,312 --> 00:54:30,420
We got him.

762
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:31,903
- [Howard] Jesus.

763
00:54:31,903 --> 00:54:32,986
- Spread 'em.

764
00:54:35,621 --> 00:54:37,625
(children chattering)

765
00:54:37,625 --> 00:54:40,958
(ice cream truck music)

766
00:54:53,596 --> 00:54:58,263
(Jordan humming musically on recording)

767
00:55:21,342 --> 00:55:24,675
(ice cream truck music)

768
00:55:38,827 --> 00:55:40,513
- Jordan can you hear me?

769
00:55:43,285 --> 00:55:44,118
Good.

770
00:55:45,541 --> 00:55:48,063
Now I want you take a big deep breath.

771
00:55:52,023 --> 00:55:52,856
Good.

772
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,500
Now we're gonna play a game Jordan.

773
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:57,500
Would you like that?

774
00:56:00,863 --> 00:56:02,584
Okay.

775
00:56:02,584 --> 00:56:04,500
I'm gonna ask you some questions

776
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,623
and I want you to write your
answers down on the paper okay?

777
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,510
Okay.

778
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:12,610
Now we'll start with a very easy question.

779
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,593
I want you to tell me your name.

780
00:56:30,174 --> 00:56:31,341
Jennifer Lynn.

781
00:56:33,193 --> 00:56:35,060
Well that's a very pretty name.

782
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,403
Did Jordan go away?

783
00:56:58,093 --> 00:57:00,593
(dog panting)

784
00:57:14,990 --> 00:57:15,823
- Hello?

785
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:20,523
Hello?

786
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,380
Is anyone in there?

787
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:25,103
- Then where are you now?

788
00:57:37,384 --> 00:57:38,801
Under the ground.

789
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:46,163
Is anyone else in your room with you?

790
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:53,683
Sometimes.

791
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:58,090
Who else is in your room
with your sometimes?

792
00:58:05,113 --> 00:58:05,946
Daddy.

793
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,490
Is Daddy in your room with you now?

794
00:58:13,434 --> 00:58:16,434
(suspenseful music)

795
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:22,303
- Hello?

796
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:38,610
- Jordan I see hands all together.

797
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:40,060
Are these hands in your room?

798
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:42,870
Are there hands in your room?

799
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:57,580
Daddy gives them to you?

800
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,783
Why does Daddy give you the hands?

801
00:59:08,251 --> 00:59:09,584
So you can play.

802
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:19,041
(rock music on headphones)

803
00:59:29,758 --> 00:59:32,950
(dog barking)

804
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:35,453
Can you draw a picture of Daddy for me?

805
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:51,930
(suspenseful music)

806
00:59:57,161 --> 01:00:02,161
(dog barking)
(rock music on headphones)

807
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:07,701
And how does Daddy give you the hands?

808
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:16,710
He makes them?

809
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:21,710
(dog barking)
(rock music on headphones)

810
01:00:27,847 --> 01:00:29,797
How does Daddy make the hands?

811
01:00:30,658 --> 01:00:33,075
(whimpering)

812
01:00:34,488 --> 01:00:36,155
It's alright Jordan.

813
01:00:37,963 --> 01:00:39,638
(dog barking)

814
01:00:39,638 --> 01:00:42,638
(suspenseful music)

815
01:00:45,908 --> 01:00:46,741
No, no, no.

816
01:00:46,741 --> 01:00:47,574
(grunting)
Hey!

817
01:00:47,574 --> 01:00:50,574
(muffled screaming)

818
01:00:54,927 --> 01:00:56,288
Jordan.
(screaming)

819
01:00:56,288 --> 01:00:57,121
It's alright, come on.

820
01:00:57,121 --> 01:00:57,954
No, Jordan, Jordan, look,

821
01:00:57,954 --> 01:00:59,380
I'm gonna count to three and when I count

822
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:01,240
to three you're gonna be calm and safe.

823
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,985
One, two, three.

824
01:01:03,985 --> 01:01:06,477
It's alright, it's alright.

825
01:01:06,477 --> 01:01:08,326
(crying)

826
01:01:08,326 --> 01:01:09,409
It's alright.

827
01:01:11,117 --> 01:01:13,617
(dog barking)

828
01:01:23,363 --> 01:01:24,937
Go to sleep.

829
01:01:24,937 --> 01:01:26,437
I'll come back tomorrow, okay?

830
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:31,730
Jordan I'll come back tomorrow, I promise.

831
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:33,780
I promise I'll come back tomorrow Jordan.

832
01:01:35,754 --> 01:01:36,587
- Help me.

833
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,353
Help me.

834
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,000
- I know what it's like to be alone.

835
01:01:56,270 --> 01:01:58,633
To be pushed away.

836
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:06,857
Locked into the darkness
with all that pain and fear.

837
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,400
It's like a terrible secret.

838
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:23,057
I won't let anyone hurt
you anymore Jordan, okay?

839
01:02:24,608 --> 01:02:25,608
Go to sleep.

840
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:36,848
Go to sleep.
(dramatic music)

841
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:35,890
(train horn whistling)

842
01:06:24,152 --> 01:06:27,152
(suspenseful music)

843
01:07:02,954 --> 01:07:05,621
(phone ringing)

844
01:07:20,485 --> 01:07:21,318
Hello?

845
01:07:21,318 --> 01:07:23,823
- Miss Macleah, it's Delarand.
- What time is it?

846
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:26,490
- Time for me to get out of here.

847
01:07:26,490 --> 01:07:27,943
I got some data for you.

848
01:07:29,816 --> 01:07:33,027
- Alright, go ahead.

849
01:07:33,027 --> 01:07:35,140
- With first and last name I have three

850
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:37,660
Jennifer Lynns listed
within the metro area.

851
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:39,630
As last and first I have none.

852
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:42,660
As first and middle I have one,

853
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:45,903
but according to public
record she's deceased.

854
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:51,743
- What's the date of death?
- July 16th, 1979.

855
01:07:54,953 --> 01:07:56,800
- You want to spell the last name for me?

856
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,677
- Jennifer Lynn Eben, E-B-E-N.

857
01:08:02,110 --> 01:08:04,433
- And where did she die?
- Lakewood Hospital.

858
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,820
But they've been closed for over 10 years.

859
01:08:10,615 --> 01:08:13,615
(suspenseful music)

860
01:08:18,896 --> 01:08:21,130
- I haven't been down
here, but once or twice

861
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:23,790
since they closed it
down and then it was only

862
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:25,500
to pull out a couple of old beds.

863
01:08:29,459 --> 01:08:33,126
Now be careful there's
all this crap around.

864
01:09:15,869 --> 01:09:18,036
(snoring)

865
01:09:19,888 --> 01:09:23,138
(tense dramatic music)

866
01:09:39,406 --> 01:09:42,323
(unsettling music)

867
01:11:23,733 --> 01:11:26,483
(birds chirping)

868
01:11:38,150 --> 01:11:41,067
(doorbell ringing)

869
01:11:44,081 --> 01:11:45,047
- Yes?

870
01:11:45,047 --> 01:11:46,400
- I'm Investigator Macleah.

871
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,153
I'm working with the Huston police.

872
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:51,080
Is Dr. Eben at home?

873
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:53,440
- No I'm sorry, but he's away on vacation.

874
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,520
- Do you know when he'll return?

875
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:58,260
- Not for another five or six days.

876
01:11:58,260 --> 01:11:59,930
I hope there isn't any trouble.

877
01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:00,930
- Oh no, not at all.

878
01:12:01,770 --> 01:12:02,800
You are?

879
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,080
- I'm Mrs. Voss, the housekeeper.

880
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:07,412
- Mrs. Voss would you mind
if I came in for a moment?

881
01:12:07,412 --> 01:12:09,412
I would like to ask you a few questions.

882
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:14,593
- Well, yes, I suppose.
- Great, thank you.

883
01:12:16,997 --> 01:12:20,138
(dog yapping)

884
01:12:20,138 --> 01:12:22,690
- Could I get your something to drink?

885
01:12:22,690 --> 01:12:24,170
- Just some water please.

886
01:12:24,170 --> 01:12:25,920
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

887
01:12:30,489 --> 01:12:33,406
(off kilter music)

888
01:12:44,844 --> 01:12:47,427
(dog wheezing)

889
01:12:49,882 --> 01:12:51,402
- Here we are.

890
01:12:51,402 --> 01:12:53,078
- Oh, thank you.

891
01:12:53,078 --> 01:12:53,911
Thank you.

892
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,920
Are these pictures of Mrs. Eben?

893
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,210
- Yes.

894
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:03,543
She's lovely isn't she?

895
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:07,600
She passed on some years back.

896
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,653
Oh here's my lady.

897
01:13:11,290 --> 01:13:13,760
I never knew the woman, but I hear that

898
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:16,413
she was a great musician,
a concert pianist.

899
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:21,600
- Do you know where Dr.
Eben's gone on vacation?

900
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,420
- Oh no, he keeps his plans to himself.

901
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:26,840
Well, he checks in every now and then,

902
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:29,340
but he always likes to be left alone.

903
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:31,200
- So he doesn't tell you where he goes?

904
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,033
- No.

905
01:13:33,339 --> 01:13:34,940
I'm sorry.

906
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:36,370
- Oh.

907
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:38,980
Does he take his daughter
with him on his trips?

908
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:40,870
- You mean Jenny?

909
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:42,480
I don't know.

910
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:45,160
Of course he visits her
quite often I suppose.

911
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,230
- Visits her?

912
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:49,500
- [Voss] She's away at a
private school in Europe.

913
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:50,950
A very fine school for girls.

914
01:13:52,210 --> 01:13:53,850
- You know I didn't notice
any pictures of Jenny.

915
01:13:53,850 --> 01:13:55,200
I wonder if you have a photo

916
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,588
that I might be able to look at?

917
01:13:57,588 --> 01:14:00,000
- Why yes of course.

918
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:00,933
Let's see.

919
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:04,300
Of course I didn't know her myself,

920
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:05,803
but she's a lovely girl.

921
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:08,440
Oh here we are.

922
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:09,783
This is a fine picture.

923
01:14:12,229 --> 01:14:13,550
Isn't she a pretty girl.

924
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:15,520
She looks just like her mother.

925
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:18,343
- And where was this taken?
- I don't really know.

926
01:14:21,650 --> 01:14:23,193
- The date on this is 1962.

927
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:26,900
- Oh.

928
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:29,160
Well it is isn't it?

929
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:32,210
Well then this must be
a picture of Mrs. Eben

930
01:14:32,210 --> 01:14:34,343
and the house she grew up in as a girl.

931
01:14:38,330 --> 01:14:40,890
- Yes, could I speak to
Captain Swaggert please?

932
01:14:40,890 --> 01:14:42,613
This is Audrey Macleah.

933
01:14:43,624 --> 01:14:45,753
Well could you get him on dispatch for me?

934
01:14:49,905 --> 01:14:52,905
(suspenseful music)

935
01:14:54,301 --> 01:14:59,301
(horn honking)
(tires squealing)

936
01:15:25,588 --> 01:15:28,088
(eerie music)

937
01:15:32,809 --> 01:15:35,392
(dogs barking)

938
01:15:40,218 --> 01:15:43,385
(wind chimes ringing)

939
01:15:51,296 --> 01:15:54,213
(knocking on door)

940
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:03,840
(suspenseful music)

941
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:06,757
(glass shattering)

942
01:18:09,959 --> 01:18:12,459
(eerie music)

943
01:21:23,894 --> 01:21:26,144
(thudding)

944
01:21:29,316 --> 01:21:31,566
(groaning)

945
01:22:47,958 --> 01:22:50,958
(suspenseful music)

946
01:24:34,892 --> 01:24:37,309
(whimpering)

947
01:24:46,447 --> 01:24:47,824
Oh my god.

948
01:24:47,824 --> 01:24:49,776
It's okay, it's okay.

949
01:24:49,776 --> 01:24:50,609
I tell you it's okay.

950
01:24:50,609 --> 01:24:52,189
It's okay, no, no, no, no.

951
01:24:52,189 --> 01:24:53,406
I'm here to help you.

952
01:24:53,406 --> 01:24:56,157
Shh, shh, I need you to be calm alright?

953
01:24:56,157 --> 01:24:57,740
No, shh, I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:24:57,740 --> 01:24:58,957
I'm gonna help you okay?

955
01:24:58,957 --> 01:25:01,314
I'm gonna take this off your eyes.

956
01:25:01,314 --> 01:25:04,080
I need you stay calm, alright?

957
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:05,800
It's okay, look at me, look at me.

958
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:08,303
I'm a police officer,
I'm gonna help you, okay?

959
01:25:08,303 --> 01:25:10,390
I'm gonna take this off your mouth

960
01:25:10,390 --> 01:25:12,790
and I want you to be very very quiet

961
01:25:12,790 --> 01:25:15,739
and nod you'll be very quiet okay?

962
01:25:15,739 --> 01:25:17,277
Okay, okay.

963
01:25:17,277 --> 01:25:18,110
It's okay.

964
01:25:19,988 --> 01:25:21,549
I'll get your hands.

965
01:25:21,549 --> 01:25:22,382
Okay.

966
01:25:23,486 --> 01:25:27,736
And then we're just going
to walk out of here okay?

967
01:25:28,610 --> 01:25:31,277
Walk right out of here, alright?

968
01:25:32,323 --> 01:25:34,073
Shh, don't be scared.

969
01:25:36,625 --> 01:25:37,458

970
01:25:37,458 --> 01:25:38,291

I want you to stay right here.

978
01:25:49,814 --> 01:25:51,795
Just stay right okay?

979
01:25:51,795 --> 01:25:53,378
Don't say anything.

980
01:25:54,263 --> 01:25:55,096
Okay?

981
01:26:15,297 --> 01:26:18,297
(suspenseful music)

982
01:26:42,919 --> 01:26:43,752

You have to be quiet.

01:28:34,481 --> 01:28:35,314
I know you want to go home.

01:28:35,314 --> 01:28:38,540
I'm gonna get you home, but
I need you to be quiet okay?

1005
01:28:38,540 --> 01:28:40,542
Nod your head you'll be quiet.

Alright stay here.

1011
01:29:51,063 --> 01:29:53,813
- And how's my little girl today?

1012
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:01,633
Your Daddy brought you a special surprise.

1013
01:30:27,546 --> 01:30:29,205
Happy birthday my pet.

1014
01:30:29,205 --> 01:30:31,538
(chuckling)

1015
01:30:50,270 --> 01:30:52,870
Now it's time for you to
play a song for your daddy.

1016
01:31:09,583 --> 01:31:12,916
(dissonant piano music)

1023
01:33:19,170 --> 01:33:20,323
And who would you be?

1024
01:33:23,300 --> 01:33:25,173
I asked you a question.

1025
01:33:25,173 --> 01:33:29,506
(clanging)
(crying)

1026
01:33:31,230 --> 01:33:32,163
Don't be afraid.

I won't hurt you.

1028
01:33:40,910 --> 01:33:41,743
Look at you.

1029
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,023
You're shaking like a leaf.

1030
01:33:49,533 --> 01:33:54,250
Let me see your hand.

1031
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:55,417
Let me see it.

1032
01:33:57,880 --> 01:33:58,713
Let me see it.

1033
01:34:01,428 --> 01:34:03,347
- Fuck you.

1034
01:34:03,347 --> 01:34:05,811
- That's not what I had in mind.

1035
01:34:05,811 --> 01:34:08,466
(thumping)
(groaning)

1036

1044
01:34:49,132 --> 01:34:51,693
Good girl, good girl, good girl.

1045
01:34:51,693 --> 01:34:52,882
