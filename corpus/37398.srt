1
00:00:15,761 --> 00:00:17,626
Sam, we´re getting
straight gammas...

2
00:00:17,796 --> 00:00:20,560
every half pulse
at irregular intervals.

3
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,860
Let´s move to right ascension
23 hours, 5 minutes.

4
00:00:25,037 --> 00:00:27,130
Sam, what the hell is going on
out here?

5
00:00:27,306 --> 00:00:29,137
Alpha Orionis
is going supernova.

6
00:00:29,308 --> 00:00:31,868
Sometime
in the next 100 million years.

7
00:00:32,044 --> 00:00:33,944
-Thursday.
-Excuse me?

8
00:00:34,112 --> 00:00:36,603
lt´s going supernova Thursday.

9
00:00:36,782 --> 00:00:40,183
Sam, if Alpha Orionis
were about to go supernova...

10
00:00:40,352 --> 00:00:42,115
there would be silicon flashes.

11
00:00:42,287 --> 00:00:43,845
Neutrino emissions.

12
00:00:44,022 --> 00:00:47,116
Even in daylight,
we would be able to see--

13
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:49,157
You predicted this?

14
00:00:52,864 --> 00:00:54,195
Excuse me, Sam.

15
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:55,526
l know you´re busy,
but it´s almost noon.

16
00:00:55,701 --> 00:00:57,032
Carl, it´s almost noon.

17
00:00:57,202 --> 00:00:58,669
lt´s noon, everybody. Let´s go!

18
00:00:58,837 --> 00:01:00,031
Get in position! Let´s go!

19
00:01:00,205 --> 00:01:01,729
What?

20
00:01:07,346 --> 00:01:08,836
What are you doing?

21
00:01:12,951 --> 00:01:15,146
You´re pointing
the damn thing down!

22
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:18,549
Professor,
there´s this other phenomenon...

23
00:01:18,724 --> 00:01:20,919
that Sam gives
his priority to at noon.

24
00:01:21,093 --> 00:01:22,253
Other priority? Now?

25
00:01:22,427 --> 00:01:24,827
Every day.

26
00:01:24,997 --> 00:01:26,794
What could be more important?

27
00:01:26,965 --> 00:01:30,662
Actually, this event
isn´t strictly celestial.

28
00:02:24,022 --> 00:02:25,114
l wuv you.

29
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,621
He loved me...

30
00:02:26,792 --> 00:02:28,259
said the little blue man...

31
00:02:28,427 --> 00:02:31,260
And scared me
right out of my wits.

32
00:02:39,671 --> 00:02:41,036
What is it?

33
00:02:44,476 --> 00:02:46,637
Remember l told you they were
going to pick a teacher...

34
00:02:46,812 --> 00:02:48,939
to represent the district
at the school in New York?

35
00:02:49,114 --> 00:02:50,672
New York? You?

36
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:52,749
That´s great.

37
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,114
Sam, don´t look at me like that.

38
00:02:56,288 --> 00:02:57,312
lt´s only two months.

39
00:02:57,489 --> 00:02:59,423
lt´s not like
l´m going to the moon.

40
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:01,286
Two months is a long time.

41
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,950
You could come.

42
00:03:03,128 --> 00:03:04,789
You know l can´t.

43
00:03:04,963 --> 00:03:06,328
You could take off work.

44
00:03:06,498 --> 00:03:08,056
You just never
want to get out of this town...

45
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:09,791
and see the possibilities.

46
00:03:09,968 --> 00:03:12,232
Everything l want to see
is right here.

47
00:03:12,404 --> 00:03:14,429
You, the sky.

48
00:03:14,606 --> 00:03:19,634
Sam, l went to school
in that building right there.

49
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:21,836
l hung upside down
on this junglegym.

50
00:03:22,013 --> 00:03:24,880
ln 20 years,
l haven´t moved an inch.

51
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,280
l fell in love with you
on this junglegym.

52
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:35,324
You know how much l want
to do this, but l love you.

53
00:03:35,494 --> 00:03:38,156
So if you tell me to stay,
l´ll stay.

54
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,059
Stay.

55
00:04:41,726 --> 00:04:45,560
Hey, Joe, hoist it up!

56
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,163
lt´s got to be higher.

57
00:04:47,332 --> 00:04:48,629
Much higher.

58
00:05:19,364 --> 00:05:21,389
Mr. Green,
what are you doing here?

59
00:05:21,566 --> 00:05:23,363
l was just on my way
to the airport.

60
00:05:23,535 --> 00:05:24,832
Come here, Sam.

61
00:05:25,003 --> 00:05:27,836
ls Linda all right?

62
00:05:28,006 --> 00:05:29,166
Sam, listen to me.

63
00:05:29,341 --> 00:05:32,606
Love can sometimes be
a very difficult thing.

64
00:05:32,777 --> 00:05:34,176
Listen up.

65
00:05:34,346 --> 00:05:37,440
''Dear Sam, this is the most
difficult thing l´ve ever done.

66
00:05:37,616 --> 00:05:38,947
''l´m sorry
l don´t have the courage...

67
00:05:39,117 --> 00:05:40,482
''to do it face-to-face.

68
00:05:40,652 --> 00:05:41,880
''l never planned this, Sam.''

69
00:05:42,053 --> 00:05:43,179
Mr. Green, what is this?

70
00:05:43,355 --> 00:05:44,686
She left you.

71
00:05:44,856 --> 00:05:45,914
l´m reading her Dear John.

72
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:50,221
''lt´s not you, Sam.
How can l make you understand?

73
00:05:50,395 --> 00:05:51,828
''Your life is set.

74
00:05:51,997 --> 00:05:55,228
''You have your stars
and your friends and the town...

75
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,766
''but l feel
like l´m just finding out...

76
00:05:57,936 --> 00:05:59,631
''what mine is all about.

77
00:05:59,804 --> 00:06:04,468
''Oh, Sam, so many emotions
are surfacing as l write this.''

78
00:06:04,643 --> 00:06:05,940
Where is she, Mr. Green?

79
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:09,012
She thought it would be best
if you didn´t talk for a while.

80
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,546
Let me finish this up.

81
00:06:11,716 --> 00:06:13,911
''You´re my best friend
in the world, Sam...

82
00:06:14,085 --> 00:06:16,485
''so you must know
that this is the way l am.

83
00:06:16,655 --> 00:06:18,520
''l can´t help it.
lt´s my nature.''

84
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,555
lt´s true, son. She´s nuts.

85
00:06:20,725 --> 00:06:22,522
l´m not finished.

86
00:06:22,694 --> 00:06:24,855
The best part´s coming up.

87
00:06:55,226 --> 00:06:56,887
Would you mind just checking?

88
00:07:03,735 --> 00:07:05,168
Two blocks down and to the left.

89
00:07:05,337 --> 00:07:06,304
Thanks.

90
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:07,995
l hope
l´m doing the right thing.

91
00:07:08,173 --> 00:07:09,936
l´m sure you are.

92
00:07:58,189 --> 00:07:59,588
Honey!

93
00:07:59,758 --> 00:08:01,851
What is it?

94
00:08:02,027 --> 00:08:03,654
Can you get that?

95
00:08:03,828 --> 00:08:05,159
l´m taking a nap.

96
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,422
l´m in the bath.

97
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:08,395
All right.

98
00:08:08,566 --> 00:08:10,761
l hear you, God damn it!

99
00:08:10,935 --> 00:08:12,960
Are you OK?

100
00:08:13,138 --> 00:08:14,799
What´s this table doing here?

101
00:08:14,973 --> 00:08:17,305
This better be goddamn good!

102
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:18,908
You´re ruining my beauty sleep!

103
00:08:19,077 --> 00:08:21,671
Damn you! Lay off the buzzer!

104
00:08:22,981 --> 00:08:24,812
Who is it?

105
00:08:24,983 --> 00:08:28,180
No problem here.

106
00:08:28,353 --> 00:08:29,718
Who is it?

107
00:10:32,076 --> 00:10:34,874
Morning, everybody.

108
00:10:35,046 --> 00:10:37,310
Morning, Linda.
Morning, Tarzan.

109
00:10:38,816 --> 00:10:40,875
We are...

110
00:10:41,052 --> 00:10:43,680
six minutes
later than yesterday.

111
00:10:43,855 --> 00:10:48,656
That´s six...
carry the two. Good.

112
00:10:52,931 --> 00:10:54,262
Ah, there.

113
00:10:54,432 --> 00:10:55,831
See that?

114
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,833
Medium smile...no teeth.

115
00:11:01,072 --> 00:11:03,006
Don´t forget the vase.

116
00:11:03,174 --> 00:11:04,664
Got to get it
perfectly centered.

117
00:11:04,842 --> 00:11:06,275
There? No.

118
00:11:06,444 --> 00:11:08,469
There? No.

119
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,542
One more. Why not?

120
00:11:16,754 --> 00:11:19,587
Annoying, isn´t it, honey?

121
00:11:19,757 --> 00:11:23,090
Grin all you want, monkey man.

122
00:11:23,261 --> 00:11:25,661
All you are
is a passing meteor shower.

123
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,958
You´ll be gone soon enough.

124
00:11:29,133 --> 00:11:32,762
l feel sorry for you,
you poor bastard.

125
00:11:50,822 --> 00:11:52,585
Carl, it´s me, Sam.

126
00:11:52,757 --> 00:11:53,849
Calm down. l´m fine.

127
00:11:54,025 --> 00:11:55,356
l´m still in New York.

128
00:11:57,262 --> 00:11:58,320
We´re great.

129
00:11:58,496 --> 00:11:59,929
Linda´s very happy.

130
00:12:00,098 --> 00:12:02,396
We may stay a while.
We´re very busy.

131
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:04,159
There´s lots to do.

132
00:12:05,937 --> 00:12:09,429
Listen, Carl, l need you
to sell my truck.

133
00:12:09,607 --> 00:12:11,165
Whatever you can get for it.

134
00:12:11,342 --> 00:12:14,709
l´m just a little short of cash
right now.

135
00:12:22,453 --> 00:12:23,886
l´m still here.

136
00:12:24,055 --> 00:12:26,615
Listen, Carl,
there´s something else l need...

137
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,624
and Professor Wells
doesn´t have to know about it.

138
00:13:21,946 --> 00:13:25,040
Hey, Linda. How you doing?

139
00:13:28,086 --> 00:13:30,316
You want to hear
something funny?

140
00:13:30,488 --> 00:13:33,719
l saw this on the news
before l came out.

141
00:13:33,891 --> 00:13:36,325
Fainting goats.
l´m not making this up.

142
00:13:36,494 --> 00:13:37,791
There´s this breed of goats.

143
00:13:37,962 --> 00:13:40,760
l don´t know why, but...

144
00:13:40,932 --> 00:13:43,093
they faint
at the slightest thing.

145
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:47,897
lf they hear a loud noise
or a gun goes off...

146
00:13:48,072 --> 00:13:52,475
they black out, fall right over,
one after the other.

147
00:13:58,116 --> 00:14:00,607
l thought you´d like that.

148
00:15:19,263 --> 00:15:21,026
Get off.

149
00:15:40,985 --> 00:15:43,283
l don´t even have a chart
for that.

150
00:15:47,692 --> 00:15:48,818
Get over here.

151
00:15:50,228 --> 00:15:51,286
Gotcha!

152
00:17:03,901 --> 00:17:05,698
Get away from here!

153
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:13,508
l´m warning you!
l have a gun!

154
00:17:14,545 --> 00:17:15,534
Oh, shit.

155
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,792
What the hell are you?

156
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:52,139
What do you want?
Who are you?

157
00:17:52,316 --> 00:17:54,477
Excuse me.
l asked a question.

158
00:17:54,652 --> 00:17:57,018
l live here.
What do you want?

159
00:18:00,157 --> 00:18:02,421
l asked you a question.

160
00:18:08,499 --> 00:18:09,830
Don´t touch that.

161
00:18:10,001 --> 00:18:11,969
Get away from that.

162
00:18:15,373 --> 00:18:18,206
Who the hell are you?
What do you want?

163
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:20,035
They´ll hear you.

164
00:18:20,211 --> 00:18:22,577
What are you talking about?

165
00:18:22,747 --> 00:18:27,775
Your little Goldilocks
and my ex-fiancé.

166
00:18:33,124 --> 00:18:35,149
Hold it.

167
00:18:35,326 --> 00:18:39,353
Are you saying that guy,
that thing over there--

168
00:18:43,934 --> 00:18:45,265
What´s your name?

169
00:18:45,436 --> 00:18:46,494
Mike.

170
00:18:46,671 --> 00:18:47,729
What´s your name, Mike?

171
00:18:47,905 --> 00:18:48,872
Sam.

172
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,803
Sam, l´m Maggie.

173
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:53,307
l´ll be staying here a while.

174
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,986
l sleep naked.

175
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,149
lt´s the only way
l´m comfortable.

176
00:19:10,327 --> 00:19:11,385
So don´t think of it
as a come-on...

177
00:19:11,562 --> 00:19:13,154
because if you so much
as breathe in my direction...

178
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,992
l will nail your willy
to that beam.

179
00:19:17,101 --> 00:19:20,070
Don´t mess with my stuff,
don´t get in my way...

180
00:19:20,237 --> 00:19:23,297
and l´m sure
we´ll get along fine.

181
00:19:23,474 --> 00:19:24,907
Nighty-night.

182
00:20:29,373 --> 00:20:31,273
What is all this stuff?

183
00:20:31,442 --> 00:20:33,433
Bugging equipment, cactus.

184
00:20:33,611 --> 00:20:35,670
Like listening bugging?

185
00:20:35,846 --> 00:20:37,507
Bugging who?

186
00:20:39,617 --> 00:20:41,346
Take a wild guess.

187
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:44,920
Why would anyone
want to do that?

188
00:20:45,089 --> 00:20:46,784
´Cause l want to hear
what goes on in there.

189
00:20:46,957 --> 00:20:48,788
Don´t you want to hear
what goes on in there?

190
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:49,857
No, l do not.

191
00:20:50,027 --> 00:20:50,959
Why not?

192
00:20:51,128 --> 00:20:54,655
´Cause that would be
an invasion of her privacy.

193
00:20:54,832 --> 00:20:56,800
Excuse me, Mr. Video.

194
00:20:56,967 --> 00:20:58,298
That´s not a video.

195
00:20:58,469 --> 00:20:59,959
lt´s a camera obscura.

196
00:21:00,137 --> 00:21:01,468
lt´s pure light.

197
00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:03,106
l´m not spying.

198
00:21:03,274 --> 00:21:04,639
l just want to be with her.

199
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:07,403
That´s completely different.

200
00:21:07,578 --> 00:21:09,239
l know how you feel.

201
00:21:09,413 --> 00:21:11,745
You want him back so badly
that you can´t stand it.

202
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,747
lt´s like your guts
are twisting around inside.

203
00:21:13,918 --> 00:21:15,510
But bugging their apartment...

204
00:21:15,686 --> 00:21:17,517
What?

205
00:21:17,688 --> 00:21:20,555
l don´t want him back.
l want him vaporized.

206
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:22,853
Extinguished!

207
00:21:23,027 --> 00:21:24,790
When l´m done with him...

208
00:21:24,962 --> 00:21:27,863
he´ll be a twitchy little stain
on the floor.

209
00:21:32,603 --> 00:21:33,535
ls that what you´re doing?

210
00:21:33,704 --> 00:21:35,899
You´re waiting
for her to leave him for you?

211
00:21:36,073 --> 00:21:37,404
Absolutely.

212
00:21:37,575 --> 00:21:38,837
Have you seen him?

213
00:21:39,009 --> 00:21:41,739
He is irrelevant.
Linda and l are soul mates.

214
00:21:41,912 --> 00:21:44,005
This is just a passing phase.

215
00:21:44,181 --> 00:21:47,207
They´re going to break up
tonight. l know it.

216
00:21:47,384 --> 00:21:48,908
l´m listening.

217
00:21:49,086 --> 00:21:50,417
l´m an astronomer.

218
00:21:50,588 --> 00:21:52,715
lt´s my job
to find patterns in things...

219
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,415
that seem completely random.

220
00:21:55,593 --> 00:21:58,187
l found a pattern.

221
00:21:58,362 --> 00:22:00,193
lt´s all in the data.

222
00:22:00,364 --> 00:22:02,423
The data.

223
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,659
This data.

224
00:22:04,835 --> 00:22:06,928
''Mutual feeding activity.''

225
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,537
lt´s the number of times
that Linda...

226
00:22:08,706 --> 00:22:10,105
and what´s-his-name feed
each other.

227
00:22:10,274 --> 00:22:11,263
You´re counting.

228
00:22:11,442 --> 00:22:13,069
Not just that. Everything.

229
00:22:13,244 --> 00:22:15,940
Kisses, hugs, smiles, fights.

230
00:22:16,113 --> 00:22:17,102
They fight?

231
00:22:17,281 --> 00:22:18,407
Not yet.

232
00:22:18,582 --> 00:22:20,607
Long looks,
whispering, shouting.

233
00:22:20,784 --> 00:22:21,773
They shout?

234
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,112
You´re missing the point.

235
00:22:23,287 --> 00:22:25,687
Tonight
there´s going to be a fight.

236
00:22:25,856 --> 00:22:27,346
They are going to break up...

237
00:22:27,524 --> 00:22:29,219
and l´m going to be
right here for her.

238
00:22:29,393 --> 00:22:31,827
Tonight this will all be over...

239
00:22:31,996 --> 00:22:34,931
so you might as well
start packing your bags.

240
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:40,594
That is the most pathetic thing
l´ve ever heard.

241
00:22:40,771 --> 00:22:41,965
l don´t mean that trivially.

242
00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:44,733
l´m a photographer.
l´ve seen a lot of things.

243
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:47,275
l once took pictures
of a man who ate his own legs...

244
00:22:47,444 --> 00:22:49,571
and you would be the black sheep
of that family.

245
00:22:49,747 --> 00:22:52,079
What is your evil plan--
squirt him with squirt guns?

246
00:22:52,249 --> 00:22:53,807
Throw rotten strawberries
at him?

247
00:22:53,984 --> 00:22:55,815
You looked in my satchel?

248
00:22:55,986 --> 00:22:57,078
Yeah. Call a cop.

249
00:22:57,254 --> 00:23:00,690
You are
a strange, tragic little man.

250
00:23:00,858 --> 00:23:03,383
Say what you want.
Linda and l are in love.

251
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,050
Except for her
boning my boyfriend...

252
00:23:05,229 --> 00:23:06,628
you guys are the perfect couple.

253
00:23:06,797 --> 00:23:09,459
Listen, Catwoman,
at the end of the day...

254
00:23:09,633 --> 00:23:11,999
she is coming back to me,
and we´re going to be happy.

255
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:13,602
And where are you going to be?

256
00:23:13,771 --> 00:23:17,070
All alone somewhere, hatching
some little revenge scheme.

257
00:23:19,977 --> 00:23:21,604
Let me tell you something, Sam.

258
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:24,475
Listen very carefully.
Are you listening?

259
00:23:24,648 --> 00:23:27,276
The only way that girl
is coming back to you...

260
00:23:27,451 --> 00:23:29,282
is if a blast of semen
catapults her...

261
00:23:29,453 --> 00:23:31,614
across the street
and through the window.

262
00:23:34,358 --> 00:23:34,391
 

263
00:23:34,391 --> 00:23:36,256
l want you out.

264
00:23:36,427 --> 00:23:37,758
Not going to happen.

265
00:23:37,928 --> 00:23:39,327
l was here first.

266
00:23:39,496 --> 00:23:42,829
Put me down for half the rent
and get out of my face.

267
00:23:46,971 --> 00:23:49,201
l wouldn´t do that
if l were you.

268
00:23:49,373 --> 00:23:50,362
Why not?

269
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:51,974
You paid for it.

270
00:23:56,146 --> 00:23:57,636
You stole my money.

271
00:23:57,815 --> 00:23:59,806
You took everything l had
to buy this crap?

272
00:23:59,984 --> 00:24:01,508
That was everything you had?

273
00:24:01,685 --> 00:24:04,586
What the hell
is that for, anyway?

274
00:24:04,755 --> 00:24:07,383
lt´s pretty, Sam.

275
00:24:21,739 --> 00:24:23,229
There we go.

276
00:24:25,843 --> 00:24:27,470
You can hear them?

277
00:24:29,213 --> 00:24:30,475
Are they talking?

278
00:24:33,017 --> 00:24:34,006
What about?

279
00:24:34,184 --> 00:24:36,084
You wouldn´t be interested.

280
00:24:37,721 --> 00:24:38,915
Let me hear.

281
00:24:39,089 --> 00:24:40,317
lt´s wrong, Sam.

282
00:24:40,491 --> 00:24:42,254
Just for a second.

283
00:24:42,426 --> 00:24:44,326
l just want to hear
her sweet voice.

284
00:24:44,495 --> 00:24:45,484
Beg me.

285
00:24:45,662 --> 00:24:46,594
Please.

286
00:24:46,764 --> 00:24:49,494
Excuse me.
Did you say something?

287
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:50,792
Please let me hear.

288
00:24:55,305 --> 00:24:56,329
Oh, my God.

289
00:24:56,507 --> 00:24:58,134
He´s killing her.

290
00:24:58,308 --> 00:24:59,639
He´s killing her, all right...

291
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,607
and she´s loving
every minute of it.

292
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:03,303
She´s not like that.

293
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,075
She likes to make love quiet
and slow and gentle.

294
00:25:07,251 --> 00:25:09,481
That girl of yours
is a carnival ride.

295
00:25:09,653 --> 00:25:10,915
This is horrible.

296
00:25:11,088 --> 00:25:13,113
This is worse than l´d imagined.

297
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,279
Want me to turn it off?

298
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:16,221
No. l need to hear it.

299
00:25:16,393 --> 00:25:18,156
How very brave.

300
00:25:26,437 --> 00:25:30,066
He´s making love
to her in French.

301
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,141
You know, Sam,
French men are very small.

302
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,675
But not this guy.

303
00:25:34,845 --> 00:25:36,437
lt´s like Godzilla´s tail.

304
00:25:36,613 --> 00:25:38,877
He could take down Tokyo
with that thing.

305
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:42,018
This has got to be
the longest orgasm l´ve heard.

306
00:25:42,186 --> 00:25:44,086
Sam, you want your charts?

307
00:25:44,254 --> 00:25:47,314
You enjoy making me suffer.

308
00:25:49,326 --> 00:25:50,987
Help me get him, Sam.

309
00:25:51,161 --> 00:25:52,822
Take the road less traveled.

310
00:25:52,996 --> 00:25:54,327
lt´ll make all the difference.

311
00:25:54,498 --> 00:25:56,363
Forget it.

312
00:25:56,533 --> 00:25:58,467
l will not get sucked
into your nightmare.

313
00:25:58,635 --> 00:26:01,126
Whatever.

314
00:26:01,305 --> 00:26:03,933
l think l can get this
in stereo.

315
00:26:08,345 --> 00:26:10,973
Welcome to New York, spy-boy.

316
00:26:34,805 --> 00:26:37,137
Slim Jim?

317
00:26:37,307 --> 00:26:40,071
Let´s see what Ken and Barbie
are having tonight.

318
00:26:43,447 --> 00:26:44,539
Squab.

319
00:26:44,715 --> 00:26:48,082
He marinates it for half a day
in a lemon-wine sauce...

320
00:26:48,252 --> 00:26:49,776
and he braises it with sugar.

321
00:26:49,953 --> 00:26:51,944
Please be quiet.
l have to concentrate.

322
00:26:52,122 --> 00:26:53,885
lt´s happening tonight.

323
00:26:54,057 --> 00:26:55,649
Smells delicious.

324
00:26:55,826 --> 00:26:58,192
l´ll tell you a secret.

325
00:26:58,362 --> 00:27:00,421
lt´s not my recipe.

326
00:27:00,597 --> 00:27:04,124
l met an old man, and he said...

327
00:27:04,301 --> 00:27:06,360
only prepare it
for the woman you love.

328
00:27:06,537 --> 00:27:09,097
Later l found out he made it
for a party he catered.

329
00:27:09,273 --> 00:27:11,764
500 people.
He´s just bursting with love.

330
00:27:11,942 --> 00:27:13,807
You should go
to his restaurant sometime.

331
00:27:13,977 --> 00:27:15,638
Good food, good people.

332
00:27:15,812 --> 00:27:18,576
Wait.
Take the spoon like this...

333
00:27:18,749 --> 00:27:20,910
Just let her eat it,
you maggot!

334
00:27:26,323 --> 00:27:28,416
lt´s the best thing
l´ve ever eaten.

335
00:27:28,592 --> 00:27:31,083
Will you shut up?

336
00:27:31,261 --> 00:27:33,161
l love to watch you eat.

337
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:37,289
She hates having people
watch her eat.

338
00:27:37,467 --> 00:27:39,094
He´s going down in flames.

339
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:40,600
Here it comes.

340
00:27:40,771 --> 00:27:44,468
Oh, you know...
l heard the most amusing story.

341
00:27:44,641 --> 00:27:47,769
There is this--
What are they called?

342
00:27:47,945 --> 00:27:49,469
Sheep.

343
00:27:49,646 --> 00:27:51,136
Yeah. A breed of goats.

344
00:27:51,315 --> 00:27:53,806
And when they hear
a sharp sound, they fall over.

345
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,315
A sharp sound?

346
00:27:55,485 --> 00:27:56,816
Yeah. Anything.

347
00:27:56,987 --> 00:28:00,445
You clap your hands,
and they fall over.

348
00:28:00,624 --> 00:28:01,784
That´s my story.

349
00:28:01,959 --> 00:28:03,790
They pass out
when they hear a sharp sound.

350
00:28:03,961 --> 00:28:05,622
lt´s true.

351
00:28:05,796 --> 00:28:08,458
They just fall over
on the ground.

352
00:28:08,632 --> 00:28:10,429
That´s my kiss.

353
00:28:11,969 --> 00:28:13,266
That´s my...

354
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,910
Oh, not the food.

355
00:28:28,151 --> 00:28:29,709
l´ll do it.

356
00:28:29,886 --> 00:28:31,751
l´ll do whatever you want.

357
00:28:31,922 --> 00:28:33,321
This has to stop.

358
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,617
l don´t care
about right or wrong anymore.

359
00:28:35,792 --> 00:28:37,384
This must stop.

360
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,025
All you gotta do is nudge him.

361
00:28:45,202 --> 00:28:47,295
Just graze him like that.

362
00:29:07,324 --> 00:29:08,484
Sorry.

363
00:29:11,828 --> 00:29:14,296
You´re sorry?
You should be goddamned sorry.

364
00:29:14,464 --> 00:29:17,365
You think you can trample
a person and say you´re sorry?

365
00:29:17,534 --> 00:29:18,933
Well, you can´t.

366
00:29:19,102 --> 00:29:22,196
You can´t trample on somebody´s
life and say, ''l´m sorry.''

367
00:29:22,372 --> 00:29:24,397
There ought to be
something more you can say...

368
00:29:24,574 --> 00:29:26,542
when you walk all over somebody.

369
00:29:27,778 --> 00:29:30,076
And you´re throwing food
everywhere!

370
00:29:43,126 --> 00:29:45,856
l think we took
a detour from the plan there.

371
00:29:46,029 --> 00:29:47,496
l really hit him, didn´t l?

372
00:29:47,664 --> 00:29:49,894
You smacked him one,
all right!

373
00:29:50,067 --> 00:29:51,329
How´d it feel?

374
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:52,525
Great!

375
00:29:52,703 --> 00:29:53,897
What is your plan?

376
00:29:54,071 --> 00:29:55,629
What do you want to do?

377
00:29:55,806 --> 00:29:57,330
l just want his dignity,
that´s all.

378
00:29:57,507 --> 00:30:00,943
l want him penniless, hopeless,
loveless, finished off.

379
00:30:01,111 --> 00:30:03,636
l just wish him very, very ill.

380
00:30:03,814 --> 00:30:05,213
How ill are we talking here?

381
00:30:05,382 --> 00:30:07,441
l´m not saying l want him dead.

382
00:30:07,617 --> 00:30:10,643
But, should that occur,
people die all the time.

383
00:30:10,821 --> 00:30:12,152
Why should he be any different?

384
00:30:12,322 --> 00:30:13,448
Just thinking
on my feet, though.

385
00:30:13,623 --> 00:30:15,591
l don´t have to decide
the death part right now.

386
00:30:15,692 --> 00:30:17,159
l can wait and see how l feel...

387
00:30:17,327 --> 00:30:19,124
once his dignity´s
a thing of the past.

388
00:30:19,296 --> 00:30:21,093
Am l boring you?

389
00:30:21,264 --> 00:30:23,061
Thank you, Anton.

390
00:30:25,235 --> 00:30:27,965
Maybe l shouldn´t have hit him.

391
00:30:28,138 --> 00:30:30,129
He´s just in love.

392
00:30:30,307 --> 00:30:32,639
He´s just in love,
the same as me.

393
00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:34,299
Define love.

394
00:30:35,445 --> 00:30:36,776
Why?

395
00:30:36,947 --> 00:30:38,244
Because every other word
out of you mouth is ''love.''

396
00:30:38,415 --> 00:30:39,939
l´d like
to know what it is...

397
00:30:40,117 --> 00:30:41,141
this magical ideal of yours.

398
00:30:41,318 --> 00:30:42,307
Define it.

399
00:30:42,486 --> 00:30:44,147
Well, it´s like, l don´t know...

400
00:30:44,321 --> 00:30:46,152
lt´s like all your life
you walk around...

401
00:30:46,323 --> 00:30:49,656
with this feeling of emptiness
in your stomach.

402
00:30:49,826 --> 00:30:51,657
You feel completely hollow.

403
00:30:51,828 --> 00:30:55,127
And when you´re in love,
you feel...

404
00:30:55,298 --> 00:30:56,959
not hollow.

405
00:30:59,903 --> 00:31:02,235
lt´s like without it,
there´s nothing.

406
00:31:02,406 --> 00:31:05,204
A shell.
A cavernous emptiness.

407
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:07,843
Forget it. You can´t define it.

408
00:31:08,011 --> 00:31:10,844
When l was a kid,
my father had this dog.

409
00:31:11,014 --> 00:31:14,381
lt started to get weak and
sickly so he took it to the vet.

410
00:31:14,551 --> 00:31:16,178
The doctor examines it
and says...

411
00:31:16,353 --> 00:31:18,378
a maggot must´ve laid eggs
in the dog´s butt.

412
00:31:18,555 --> 00:31:20,785
He says
there´s not much they can do.

413
00:31:20,957 --> 00:31:24,791
The baby maggots have crawled up
and started to grow...

414
00:31:24,961 --> 00:31:26,792
and eventually they´re
going to eat the dog alive...

415
00:31:26,963 --> 00:31:28,157
from the inside out.

416
00:31:28,331 --> 00:31:30,196
He says
it should be put to sleep...

417
00:31:30,367 --> 00:31:32,130
because it´s an old dog, anyway.

418
00:31:32,302 --> 00:31:33,633
But Father won´t do it.

419
00:31:33,804 --> 00:31:35,135
He takes it home.

420
00:31:35,305 --> 00:31:36,533
He puts it on the bed.

421
00:31:36,706 --> 00:31:38,367
He starts to reach up
into the dog...

422
00:31:38,542 --> 00:31:41,306
picking out the maggots
with his fingers, one by one.

423
00:31:41,478 --> 00:31:46,916
lt takes him all night,
but he gets every last one.

424
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:49,074
That dog outlived my father.

425
00:31:51,021 --> 00:31:52,613
That´s love, Sam.

426
00:31:56,827 --> 00:31:58,795
You´re not that tough, Maggie.

427
00:31:58,962 --> 00:32:00,987
l can tell
you´re not that tough.

428
00:32:01,164 --> 00:32:04,622
And you can forget
about a career with Hallmark.

429
00:32:09,873 --> 00:32:11,033
Won´t he miss the card?

430
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:13,267
He won´t know what hit him
till the bill comes...

431
00:32:13,443 --> 00:32:15,809
´cause he
only uses his platinum.

432
00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:23,110
l´ll just take everything
in this whole area.

433
00:32:24,888 --> 00:32:26,412
You know
Anton´s having an affair?

434
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,023
He is?

435
00:32:28,191 --> 00:32:29,715
That´s what Linda´s
going to think.

436
00:32:29,893 --> 00:32:31,053
Where are you sending them?

437
00:32:31,228 --> 00:32:32,217
To my Nana.

438
00:32:32,395 --> 00:32:34,920
The old battle-ax
should get a kick out of this.

439
00:32:35,065 --> 00:32:35,098
 

440
00:32:35,098 --> 00:32:37,623
How much to put lipstick
on the monkey?

441
00:32:37,801 --> 00:32:39,735
ls that for you or for him?

442
00:32:39,903 --> 00:32:41,302
l don´t touch the monkey.

443
00:32:41,471 --> 00:32:44,065
l don´t want to have anything
to do with the monkey.

444
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:45,572
How´s 40?

445
00:32:45,742 --> 00:32:50,202
For 50 l´d strap on a garter
and wax her legs.

446
00:32:51,281 --> 00:32:52,305
Lovely lipstick, darling.

447
00:32:52,482 --> 00:32:53,972
Now, honey, you can´t be
treating me this way.

448
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,777
We´ve known each other too long.

449
00:32:55,952 --> 00:32:57,783
You can´t even look me
in the eye.

450
00:32:57,954 --> 00:33:00,582
What? You´re in love?

451
00:33:01,992 --> 00:33:04,722
You´re in love with that man?

452
00:33:04,895 --> 00:33:07,659
That man could never
make you happy.

453
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,358
What the hell is that? Shit!

454
00:33:12,536 --> 00:33:14,265
Good God! Kiss him, baby!

455
00:33:14,437 --> 00:33:16,530
Get this goddamned monkey
off my back!

456
00:33:24,314 --> 00:33:25,508
Give that man a hand!

457
00:33:25,682 --> 00:33:27,445
OK, that´s fine.

458
00:33:27,617 --> 00:33:29,175
No problem.

459
00:33:31,187 --> 00:33:33,678
Greta thanks you. l thank you.

460
00:33:47,304 --> 00:33:49,636
Hello, sweetheart.

461
00:33:49,806 --> 00:33:51,865
Here we go. The target´s home.

462
00:33:52,042 --> 00:33:54,135
You know bankers.

463
00:33:54,311 --> 00:33:57,144
They want to know
every little thing.

464
00:33:57,314 --> 00:33:59,282
What do they know
about the restaurant business?

465
00:33:59,449 --> 00:34:01,644
Are we packed?

466
00:34:01,818 --> 00:34:03,786
Hey, why don´t we forget
about the Hamptons...

467
00:34:03,954 --> 00:34:05,649
and spend the weekend in bed?

468
00:34:05,822 --> 00:34:07,255
There, that look!

469
00:34:07,424 --> 00:34:08,618
She sees it.

470
00:34:11,027 --> 00:34:12,494
Stay with her.

471
00:34:12,662 --> 00:34:14,755
Go back to her, Sam!

472
00:34:14,931 --> 00:34:16,262
Stick to her.

473
00:34:16,433 --> 00:34:17,457
Relax.

474
00:34:17,634 --> 00:34:19,932
Anything you wanted to tell me?

475
00:34:20,103 --> 00:34:22,003
What?

476
00:34:23,006 --> 00:34:24,906
What´s that on your collar?

477
00:34:25,075 --> 00:34:27,066
Turn it up.
l can´t hear them.

478
00:34:27,243 --> 00:34:30,679
Oh, that.

479
00:34:30,847 --> 00:34:32,337
You´ll never believe this.

480
00:34:32,515 --> 00:34:34,847
l´m walking
through Washington Square...

481
00:34:35,018 --> 00:34:36,144
and there´s this stupid man.

482
00:34:36,319 --> 00:34:37,650
You know,
some guy with a monkey.

483
00:34:37,821 --> 00:34:39,948
A street performer?

484
00:34:40,123 --> 00:34:41,420
That son of a bitch, yeah.

485
00:34:41,591 --> 00:34:43,525
The monkey jumps on me
and won´t get off my back.

486
00:34:43,693 --> 00:34:44,785
You´re kidding.

487
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:48,294
The people all around,
they are laughing.

488
00:34:48,465 --> 00:34:51,798
And the monkey
is kissing me, kissing me.

489
00:34:51,968 --> 00:34:54,095
l think it peed on me.
lt stinks.

490
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:56,704
What is she laughing at?

491
00:34:56,873 --> 00:34:58,431
l don´t know.

492
00:34:58,608 --> 00:35:00,269
What do you think
of the story?

493
00:35:00,443 --> 00:35:01,432
l´ll show you what l think.

494
00:35:01,611 --> 00:35:03,101
l´ll get you.

495
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:17,555
Let´s forget
about the Hamptons.

496
00:35:17,727 --> 00:35:20,628
lt´s going very well,
don´t you think?

497
00:35:20,797 --> 00:35:23,960
Drink up, buddy,
´cause tonight we´re going in.

498
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,134
 

499
00:35:24,134 --> 00:35:25,624
There they go.

500
00:35:25,802 --> 00:35:29,363
We want to go
to the Long lsland railroad.

501
00:35:31,474 --> 00:35:34,466
ldiot never
even changed the lock.

502
00:35:39,315 --> 00:35:40,805
Close it.

503
00:35:46,523 --> 00:35:49,458
lt´s so much smaller
than it looks on TV.

504
00:36:16,453 --> 00:36:17,579
ln the couch.

505
00:36:17,754 --> 00:36:18,743
What?

506
00:36:18,922 --> 00:36:20,389
ln the couch.
Don´t make it obvious.

507
00:36:20,557 --> 00:36:22,457
-You´re kidding.
-Just do it.

508
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:24,183
Why were you wearing them?

509
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,329
Authenticity.

510
00:36:47,183 --> 00:36:48,810
What are you going to do?

511
00:36:48,985 --> 00:36:50,145
Receipts.

512
00:36:51,221 --> 00:36:52,518
Why are we whispering?

513
00:36:52,689 --> 00:36:54,156
l don´t know.

514
00:37:22,786 --> 00:37:24,253
Mine.

515
00:37:56,152 --> 00:37:57,449
Mine.

516
00:38:07,063 --> 00:38:08,621
Mine.

517
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:11,565
Mine.

518
00:38:13,236 --> 00:38:14,863
Perfection, yes?

519
00:38:17,006 --> 00:38:18,132
Voilà.

520
00:38:24,247 --> 00:38:25,680
This is comfortable.

521
00:38:31,855 --> 00:38:33,982
This is what you wear
to walk about...

522
00:38:34,157 --> 00:38:36,182
with everything swinging freely.

523
00:38:39,863 --> 00:38:42,331
Look at me. l am so fabulous.

524
00:38:42,498 --> 00:38:44,022
l am so beautiful.

525
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,168
Witness my matted chest hairs.

526
00:38:46,336 --> 00:38:48,031
They are nice, no?

527
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,814
What do you think?

528
00:39:03,319 --> 00:39:05,116
You look...

529
00:39:28,011 --> 00:39:29,706
Look at this.

530
00:40:42,518 --> 00:40:45,112
l love you, Linda.

531
00:40:45,288 --> 00:40:47,279
l hate you, Anton.

532
00:40:53,896 --> 00:40:56,626
l got to make the bed.

533
00:41:02,205 --> 00:41:04,366
Sure. Right.

534
00:41:19,756 --> 00:41:21,087
Can you clean the kitchen?

535
00:41:21,257 --> 00:41:22,417
We should get out of here.

536
00:41:22,592 --> 00:41:26,585
l think we should talk.

537
00:41:26,763 --> 00:41:28,287
Nothing to talk about.

538
00:41:29,432 --> 00:41:30,626
Yes, there is.
Something happened.

539
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,324
l would like to talk about it.

540
00:41:32,502 --> 00:41:33,935
Nothing happened, Sam.

541
00:41:34,103 --> 00:41:36,333
OK? Nothing happened.

542
00:41:36,506 --> 00:41:38,133
l know what
you´re going through.

543
00:41:38,307 --> 00:41:39,740
l´m going
through the same thing.

544
00:41:39,909 --> 00:41:42,070
Get this straight, pal.
l am not like you.

545
00:41:42,245 --> 00:41:43,576
l don´t care
what you´re going through.

546
00:41:43,746 --> 00:41:46,579
lf l thought you and l were
alike in the most trivial way...

547
00:41:46,749 --> 00:41:48,273
l would tie a rope
around my neck.

548
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:23,717
l´m sorry.

549
00:42:43,139 --> 00:42:44,936
Last night wasn´t us, Maggie.

550
00:42:45,108 --> 00:42:48,407
l know. l´m glad you know.

551
00:42:48,578 --> 00:42:53,208
Maybe we should just,
l don´t know, call it a day.

552
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:02,788
You know what´s
going to happen to her, Sam?

553
00:43:02,959 --> 00:43:04,722
He´s going to make her feel...

554
00:43:04,894 --> 00:43:06,725
like she´s
the only woman in the world.

555
00:43:06,896 --> 00:43:09,524
When he looks at her,
it´ll be just like a kid...

556
00:43:09,699 --> 00:43:13,635
looks at a Christmas tree
all lit up and shiny.

557
00:43:13,803 --> 00:43:18,706
For the first time, she´ll feel
like she´s really been seen...

558
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:20,308
and really loved.

559
00:43:20,476 --> 00:43:22,307
And then...

560
00:43:25,314 --> 00:43:27,145
And then three weeks later...

561
00:43:27,316 --> 00:43:29,648
she´ll find a pair of panties
in the couch.

562
00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:32,617
Then she´ll learn that she was
just a steppingstone.

563
00:43:32,788 --> 00:43:36,724
That he was just using her
to get a visa.

564
00:43:42,798 --> 00:43:44,459
lt´ll change her, Sam.

565
00:43:53,042 --> 00:43:55,203
l understand.

566
00:43:55,378 --> 00:43:59,246
You know
what´s always bothered me?

567
00:43:59,415 --> 00:44:02,111
l can´t see the side
of her face.

568
00:44:02,285 --> 00:44:05,618
l can never see
the left side of her face...

569
00:44:05,788 --> 00:44:07,619
when she´s standing here
in the kitchen...

570
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:09,553
because of these things
in the window.

571
00:44:09,725 --> 00:44:12,455
So help me move this over
a little bit.

572
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:17,429
Good?

573
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,295
A little more.

574
00:44:21,304 --> 00:44:22,931
Good.

575
00:44:38,955 --> 00:44:40,047
What?

576
00:44:40,223 --> 00:44:43,681
l saw the sign about the job.

577
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:45,417
l don´t want a half salt shaker
on the table.

578
00:44:45,595 --> 00:44:47,187
You go and refill it
immediately.

579
00:44:47,363 --> 00:44:48,591
Pardon.

580
00:44:50,566 --> 00:44:53,433
Nothing here for you. Go.

581
00:44:53,603 --> 00:44:55,230
Why?

582
00:44:59,609 --> 00:45:01,839
Do l need a reason
in my own restaurant?

583
00:45:02,011 --> 00:45:03,205
Of course not.

584
00:45:03,379 --> 00:45:04,812
l don´t like your face,
that´s why.

585
00:45:04,981 --> 00:45:06,346
Just go.

586
00:45:20,029 --> 00:45:21,724
Wait.

587
00:45:22,965 --> 00:45:24,626
Why did you do that?

588
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,392
Why did l do what?

589
00:45:26,569 --> 00:45:28,332
The flowers.
Why did you move it like that?

590
00:45:28,504 --> 00:45:30,699
l wanted them to be
in the middle of the table.

591
00:45:30,873 --> 00:45:32,033
Why?

592
00:45:33,376 --> 00:45:35,037
Because it was--

593
00:45:35,211 --> 00:45:36,803
lt was just something
that l had to do.

594
00:45:36,979 --> 00:45:41,040
Perhaps at heart
you seek perfection, no?

595
00:45:41,217 --> 00:45:43,913
Yes, perhaps l do.

596
00:46:01,804 --> 00:46:03,396
Almost done?

597
00:46:06,976 --> 00:46:09,069
Almost.

598
00:46:09,245 --> 00:46:11,304
Good work.

599
00:46:12,815 --> 00:46:15,784
Why don´t you stop for a moment?

600
00:46:23,292 --> 00:46:25,760
l know who you are.

601
00:46:25,928 --> 00:46:29,364
lt took me a little while,
but l figure it out.

602
00:46:31,801 --> 00:46:33,826
Dry off your hands.

603
00:46:38,307 --> 00:46:41,174
lt was you who attacked me
that day.

604
00:46:41,344 --> 00:46:43,778
Couldn´t see your eyes,
but l don´t forget a face.

605
00:46:43,946 --> 00:46:45,937
You didn´t put an address down
on your application.

606
00:46:46,115 --> 00:46:48,549
You are homeless, aren´t you?

607
00:46:48,718 --> 00:46:51,118
That´s OK. Don´t be ashamed.

608
00:46:51,287 --> 00:46:52,845
You know,
l was hungry myself once.

609
00:46:53,022 --> 00:46:55,616
l would see a rich man,
a man l envied...

610
00:46:55,791 --> 00:46:57,281
l would want to strangle him.

611
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:59,621
But that´s not the way l found.

612
00:46:59,795 --> 00:47:01,126
You must better yourself.

613
00:47:01,297 --> 00:47:03,128
Don´t be ashamed.

614
00:47:03,299 --> 00:47:06,632
Give me your hand. Come on.

615
00:47:06,802 --> 00:47:10,135
l like a man who fights
for what he wants.

616
00:47:10,306 --> 00:47:12,137
But if you
ever mess with me again...

617
00:47:12,308 --> 00:47:15,800
l´ll rip out your eyes
and rape your skull.

618
00:47:15,978 --> 00:47:17,309
Excuse my French.

619
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,108
Was a good punch, huh?

620
00:47:20,282 --> 00:47:21,943
Solid.

621
00:47:22,118 --> 00:47:23,483
lt was nice.

622
00:47:23,652 --> 00:47:26,177
So you did all his dishes
and got punched in the face.

623
00:47:26,355 --> 00:47:27,481
What was your thinking there?

624
00:47:27,656 --> 00:47:30,784
l´m missing something.
What was your plan?

625
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,622
No plan.
l just wanted to face him.

626
00:47:33,796 --> 00:47:35,457
l wanted to be
in the same room with him...

627
00:47:35,631 --> 00:47:37,428
to talk to him.

628
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,125
ln my mind, he was like a god.

629
00:47:40,302 --> 00:47:42,133
Now what do you think?

630
00:47:42,304 --> 00:47:44,704
Well, it´s not like
he´s God God anymore.

631
00:47:44,874 --> 00:47:48,935
He´s more like a volcano god
or a sea god.

632
00:47:49,111 --> 00:47:51,136
One of those sub-gods.

633
00:47:51,313 --> 00:47:53,247
Maggie, l think he likes me.

634
00:47:56,452 --> 00:47:57,919
One thing, though.

635
00:47:59,088 --> 00:48:01,784
He said something
about having sex with my skull.

636
00:48:01,957 --> 00:48:03,925
He says that to everybody.

637
00:48:04,093 --> 00:48:05,617
Don´t worry about it.

638
00:48:07,263 --> 00:48:09,128
Sorry.

639
00:48:09,298 --> 00:48:10,890
l don´t like the sound of it.

640
00:48:11,066 --> 00:48:12,897
l don´t like the image
that it conjures.

641
00:48:13,068 --> 00:48:15,559
l can´t honestly say
l blame you, Sam.

642
00:48:21,544 --> 00:48:23,603
So l let go with my hands...

643
00:48:23,779 --> 00:48:26,873
and l fell off the top
of the junglegym face-first...

644
00:48:27,049 --> 00:48:29,244
and l broke this tooth
right in half.

645
00:48:29,418 --> 00:48:32,285
l´m laying on my back,
blood all over my face...

646
00:48:32,455 --> 00:48:34,218
the kids are yelling,
the teachers are freaking out...

647
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:36,722
and l look up, and there she is.

648
00:48:36,892 --> 00:48:38,257
She´s just looking down at me...

649
00:48:38,427 --> 00:48:40,725
with this worried little smile
on her face.

650
00:48:40,896 --> 00:48:45,458
l swear to God, when l saw her,
the pain just went away.

651
00:48:45,634 --> 00:48:47,693
Once l took pictures
of a bunch of ducklings...

652
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:49,132
who imprinted
on a gardener in the park.

653
00:48:49,305 --> 00:48:50,533
They thought he was Mama...

654
00:48:50,706 --> 00:48:53,231
and they used to chase him
around all day...

655
00:48:53,409 --> 00:48:56,105
while he drove
around on his lawn mower.

656
00:48:56,278 --> 00:48:57,609
That´s exactly
what it feels like.

657
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,839
lt´s like she´s branded
on my brain.

658
00:49:00,015 --> 00:49:01,607
What happened to this guy...

659
00:49:01,784 --> 00:49:04,309
is that one day he forgot
the ducks were there.

660
00:49:04,487 --> 00:49:08,116
He put the mower in reverse,
chewed them to pieces.

661
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:10,656
Don´t you know
any happy stories?

662
00:49:12,495 --> 00:49:14,326
There he is.

663
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,966
That´s him!

664
00:49:20,135 --> 00:49:22,433
Let´s get him!

665
00:49:29,512 --> 00:49:30,911
Our work is done.

666
00:49:39,288 --> 00:49:41,620
Midgets coming out of the blue.

667
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:44,122
l had to protect myself
with one of them.

668
00:49:44,293 --> 00:49:45,885
Midgets coming out of the blue?

669
00:49:46,061 --> 00:49:49,394
Yeah. Little childrens
shooting perfume at me.

670
00:49:49,565 --> 00:49:51,863
From their guns.

671
00:49:52,034 --> 00:49:53,865
Perfume from their guns?

672
00:49:54,036 --> 00:49:55,867
Yeah. Water guns?

673
00:49:56,038 --> 00:49:57,027
Squirt guns?

674
00:49:57,206 --> 00:49:58,867
Yeah, l think. Squirt guns.

675
00:49:59,041 --> 00:50:00,133
Spooky, huh?

676
00:50:00,309 --> 00:50:02,436
Wait, the loaf,
l think it´s burning.

677
00:50:02,611 --> 00:50:04,977
Look at him trying
to weasel his way out of it.

678
00:50:05,147 --> 00:50:07,308
He didn´t do anything, Sam.

679
00:50:07,483 --> 00:50:09,815
Anton, don´t you think
it´s a little peculiar...

680
00:50:09,985 --> 00:50:12,954
that little children would be
shooting perfume at you?

681
00:50:13,122 --> 00:50:15,955
l thought it was something
American kids do.

682
00:50:16,125 --> 00:50:18,116
A fad, l don´t know.
We should have some salad.

683
00:50:18,294 --> 00:50:20,558
lt´s very expensive perfume,
Anton.

684
00:50:20,729 --> 00:50:22,526
l used to wear that perfume.

685
00:50:22,698 --> 00:50:25,064
Good call, Sam!

686
00:50:27,236 --> 00:50:30,797
Last week you had lipstick
on your collar.

687
00:50:32,074 --> 00:50:33,405
From the monkey.

688
00:50:35,311 --> 00:50:37,176
And now perfume...

689
00:50:37,346 --> 00:50:39,814
from squirt guns
from rich New York kids.

690
00:50:39,982 --> 00:50:41,381
What do you think
the odds are...

691
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:42,744
of something like that
happening to one person?

692
00:50:42,918 --> 00:50:44,943
l don´t know.
Ask a mathematician.

693
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,145
Ask your old boyfriend,
the Milky Way man.

694
00:50:47,323 --> 00:50:48,688
That´s you, Sam.

695
00:50:48,857 --> 00:50:50,688
What are you getting at?

696
00:50:50,859 --> 00:50:52,258
You´re driving me crazy.

697
00:50:52,428 --> 00:50:54,589
Anton, l want you
to promise me something.

698
00:50:54,763 --> 00:50:58,631
Just promise that if you were
ever doing anything...

699
00:50:58,801 --> 00:51:01,065
that you would tell me.

700
00:51:04,873 --> 00:51:08,309
Why are you even thinking
of such a thing?

701
00:51:08,477 --> 00:51:09,705
Maybe we could work it out.

702
00:51:09,878 --> 00:51:13,109
l just couldn´t take it
if you were lying to me.

703
00:51:13,282 --> 00:51:17,776
Sweetie, why would l have sex
with a hamburger...

704
00:51:17,953 --> 00:51:19,181
when l can make love to a steak?

705
00:51:21,824 --> 00:51:23,155
Oh, come on.

706
00:51:23,325 --> 00:51:24,986
Forget about it.

707
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,718
She´s this close, Sam.

708
00:51:26,895 --> 00:51:28,920
This close.

709
00:51:35,738 --> 00:51:38,036
Bring some cups and saucers.

710
00:51:38,207 --> 00:51:40,038
And bring some other bottles.

711
00:51:46,115 --> 00:51:47,446
What did l miss?

712
00:51:47,616 --> 00:51:49,106
l think we´re getting to them.

713
00:51:49,284 --> 00:51:51,149
l definitely think
that we´re getting to them.

714
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,220
Did you get the sweet and sour?

715
00:51:53,389 --> 00:51:54,788
Look, my darling...

716
00:51:54,957 --> 00:51:57,323
l wanted to show you how well my
hands fit on top of my knees...

717
00:51:57,493 --> 00:51:59,222
and to give you a little kiss.

718
00:51:59,395 --> 00:52:02,228
Get away from me, please.
You are rude.

719
00:52:02,398 --> 00:52:05,128
But l love you, my little lamb.
l must have you.

720
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:09,760
My love is throbbing
at quite a fevered cadence.

721
00:52:09,938 --> 00:52:11,269
You cannot have me.

722
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,998
My love is reserved for another.

723
00:52:13,175 --> 00:52:14,642
You cannot mean...

724
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:16,744
Yes, the Milky Way man!

725
00:52:16,912 --> 00:52:20,609
No! Anyone but him.

726
00:52:20,783 --> 00:52:24,241
This is a man who can predict
puffer cluster emissions.

727
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,388
To him l am nothing.

728
00:52:26,555 --> 00:52:29,115
A little, teeny--l´m a worm.

729
00:52:29,291 --> 00:52:31,418
l love his emissions.

730
00:52:31,593 --> 00:52:33,322
Not every man...

731
00:52:34,797 --> 00:52:37,322
can be a Milky Way man.

732
00:52:37,499 --> 00:52:39,364
What will you do now?

733
00:52:39,535 --> 00:52:44,131
Forlorn, l will roam the earth
by myself, thinking of you...

734
00:52:44,306 --> 00:52:47,867
and pausing occasionally to have
the sex with the skullses.

735
00:52:49,244 --> 00:52:50,905
That´s good.

736
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,138
Now be quiet about that...

737
00:52:52,314 --> 00:52:56,114
or l will make you eat
another one of those pecans!

738
00:52:56,285 --> 00:52:58,378
This is very good.

739
00:52:58,554 --> 00:53:00,954
Look how l´m licking my fingers.
You like that?

740
00:53:01,123 --> 00:53:02,818
l like everything. l am French.

741
00:53:06,628 --> 00:53:07,822
Ordering!

742
00:53:12,401 --> 00:53:14,767
l´ve been dying
for one of these all night.

743
00:53:16,205 --> 00:53:18,730
Can l ask you a question, Anton?

744
00:53:18,907 --> 00:53:20,431
Sure you can.

745
00:53:21,643 --> 00:53:24,168
How do you like America?

746
00:53:24,346 --> 00:53:25,677
Why do you ask?

747
00:53:25,848 --> 00:53:26,837
You´re French.

748
00:53:27,015 --> 00:53:29,176
Do you ever miss it?

749
00:53:29,351 --> 00:53:31,478
Do you ever get lonely
for your own country?

750
00:53:31,653 --> 00:53:34,144
l was never so much French
since l´ve been here.

751
00:53:34,323 --> 00:53:37,053
You know Superman?

752
00:53:37,226 --> 00:53:38,818
That´s me, l´m Superman.

753
00:53:40,863 --> 00:53:43,525
And France was like Krypton.

754
00:53:43,699 --> 00:53:45,929
On Krypton
everybody was Superman.

755
00:53:46,101 --> 00:53:47,329
You make a nice sauce.

756
00:53:47,503 --> 00:53:49,164
Everybody make a nice sauce.

757
00:53:49,338 --> 00:53:51,829
You say hello to a nice woman
with your French accent...

758
00:53:52,007 --> 00:53:53,531
and everybody says, ''Hello! ''

759
00:53:56,812 --> 00:54:00,908
But here on Earth,
the moment l arrived...

760
00:54:01,083 --> 00:54:03,347
l knew this was the place
l had special powers.

761
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,884
l talk about my little town...

762
00:54:05,053 --> 00:54:06,987
and the bankers
open their checkbooks and say...

763
00:54:07,156 --> 00:54:09,488
''How great, charming,
and exotic you are, Anton.''

764
00:54:09,658 --> 00:54:12,024
l could read the phone book
to a woman...

765
00:54:12,194 --> 00:54:15,789
and they become hypnotized,
wet as morning daisies.

766
00:54:15,964 --> 00:54:17,363
Here l have these powers.

767
00:54:17,533 --> 00:54:18,864
Back home, l was nothing.

768
00:54:19,034 --> 00:54:20,626
But here, l´m Superman.

769
00:54:20,803 --> 00:54:24,204
Hip-hip, America!
Hip-hip, land of freedom!

770
00:54:24,373 --> 00:54:26,568
Now you, you´re not French.

771
00:54:26,742 --> 00:54:28,573
But it´s OK, you know?

772
00:54:28,744 --> 00:54:31,144
You still have opportunity
in this country.

773
00:54:31,313 --> 00:54:34,180
Yesterday,
he had no job, no future.

774
00:54:34,349 --> 00:54:35,373
But today, a step-up.

775
00:54:35,551 --> 00:54:37,075
A little step, but a step.

776
00:54:37,252 --> 00:54:40,119
Soon you can afford a place
to live and get a girlfriend.

777
00:54:40,289 --> 00:54:41,551
l have a girlfriend.

778
00:54:41,723 --> 00:54:44,055
No, really. Pretty girl?

779
00:54:44,226 --> 00:54:46,990
She´s the most wonderful woman
in the world.

780
00:54:47,162 --> 00:54:48,720
She must love you a good deal.

781
00:54:48,897 --> 00:54:50,797
You think women only want men
for their money?

782
00:54:50,966 --> 00:54:52,297
No, not just money.

783
00:54:52,467 --> 00:54:53,729
Power also, and success.

784
00:54:53,902 --> 00:54:55,233
Don´t fool yourself, dishwasher.

785
00:54:55,404 --> 00:54:57,565
They want a man
who takes what he wants.

786
00:54:57,739 --> 00:55:00,003
l don´t think that´s true.

787
00:55:02,311 --> 00:55:03,903
Listen.

788
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:07,412
My girlfriend was seeing a man
when l met her.

789
00:55:07,583 --> 00:55:12,043
l took her back to my place,
and l ask her about him...

790
00:55:12,221 --> 00:55:13,347
very innocently, of course.

791
00:55:13,522 --> 00:55:14,614
Of course.

792
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:16,655
She had many wonderful things
to say about him.

793
00:55:16,825 --> 00:55:20,056
How nice and devoted,
how gentle he was.

794
00:55:20,229 --> 00:55:23,460
So l started to probe
in very subtle ways...

795
00:55:23,632 --> 00:55:26,066
about how strong,
powerful, and successful he was.

796
00:55:26,235 --> 00:55:27,566
l was very good.

797
00:55:27,736 --> 00:55:30,637
ln no time, we were lying
together on my couch.

798
00:55:30,806 --> 00:55:33,900
l think she wanted me
to force her away from him.

799
00:55:34,076 --> 00:55:35,941
You could see it in her eyes.

800
00:55:36,111 --> 00:55:37,135
She wanted the battle.

801
00:55:37,312 --> 00:55:40,748
She was crying, too,
but she was kissing me.

802
00:55:40,916 --> 00:55:43,885
Later, of course,
she came like a rocket.

803
00:55:47,289 --> 00:55:49,052
Don´t worry about the glass.

804
00:55:49,224 --> 00:55:51,522
l won´t charge you this time.

805
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:51,693
 

806
00:55:51,693 --> 00:55:54,287
Anton, he´s here. Matheson.

807
00:55:54,463 --> 00:55:56,522
Matheson? Are you sure?

808
00:55:56,698 --> 00:55:58,598
Table nine.

809
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:02,737
Oh, my God. lt´s him.

810
00:56:02,905 --> 00:56:04,736
Go.

811
00:56:04,907 --> 00:56:07,705
l´ll take care of him.

812
00:56:30,666 --> 00:56:31,860
Did you bring them?

813
00:56:32,034 --> 00:56:35,094
What l just did was the most
revolting thing l´ve ever done.

814
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:37,431
Harold Matheson,
the food critic for the Times.

815
00:56:37,606 --> 00:56:40,803
Big step. Are you sure
you´re ready for this?

816
00:56:41,843 --> 00:56:43,674
Everyone!

817
00:56:43,845 --> 00:56:45,335
l want everyone
to do a good job tonight.

818
00:56:45,514 --> 00:56:47,709
l want everything perfect.

819
00:56:47,883 --> 00:56:49,407
Didier, l can see this is not good!

820
00:56:49,584 --> 00:56:52,348
And you, dishwasher,
you don´t drop a dish tonight.

821
00:56:52,521 --> 00:56:54,785
l want everything perfect
for the bastard.

822
00:56:54,957 --> 00:56:56,948
Heaven for the pig.

823
00:57:01,029 --> 00:57:03,122
Gimme, gimme.

824
00:57:05,701 --> 00:57:07,430
l´ve created a monster.

825
00:57:12,541 --> 00:57:16,477
l asked your steward
for a Chenin Blanc...

826
00:57:16,645 --> 00:57:18,909
and he brought me this.

827
00:57:19,081 --> 00:57:21,413
You have any idea
how that happened?

828
00:57:21,583 --> 00:57:23,210
l took the liberty,
Mr. Matheson.

829
00:57:23,385 --> 00:57:24,909
lt´s from my private reserve.

830
00:57:25,087 --> 00:57:27,715
You know,
if l had a suspicious mind...

831
00:57:27,889 --> 00:57:30,653
l´d think you´re trying
to get on my good side.

832
00:57:30,826 --> 00:57:33,420
l thought
you would enjoy the year.

833
00:57:33,595 --> 00:57:38,430
l´d say that your little ruse
is working very well,

834
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,091
especially if you could locate
another bottle.

835
00:57:42,437 --> 00:57:45,406
Well, certainly. Excuse me.

836
00:57:45,574 --> 00:57:49,374
We might find a bottle or two.

837
00:57:49,544 --> 00:57:52,240
Enjoy your meal, Mr. Matheson.

838
00:57:52,414 --> 00:57:55,713
l´ve just come back from France.

839
00:57:55,884 --> 00:57:57,977
Whereabouts are you from?

840
00:57:58,153 --> 00:58:00,053
lt´s just Beaucaire.

841
00:58:00,222 --> 00:58:02,315
lt´s just a small province
in the south of France.

842
00:58:02,491 --> 00:58:05,392
Oh, Beaucaire.

843
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:08,495
l know that.
lsn´t that near Nîmes?

844
00:58:08,663 --> 00:58:10,597
ls that near Nîmes?

845
00:58:10,766 --> 00:58:12,063
Excuse me?

846
00:58:12,234 --> 00:58:15,067
ls that near Nîmes?

847
00:58:16,271 --> 00:58:17,738
Yes, it´s near there.

848
00:58:19,508 --> 00:58:20,907
Oh, my God!

849
00:58:21,076 --> 00:58:22,134
Did you see that?

850
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:23,641
l remember.

851
00:58:23,812 --> 00:58:27,612
lt´s a little to the south
and over the hill.

852
00:58:27,783 --> 00:58:30,946
Yes, it is on the other side
of the hill.

853
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:32,518
lt´s a little south.

854
00:59:19,334 --> 00:59:19,367
 

855
00:59:19,367 --> 00:59:20,664
The look on Matheson´s face.

856
00:59:20,836 --> 00:59:21,894
What are you smiling about?

857
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:23,935
l´m sorry.

858
00:59:24,106 --> 00:59:26,540
lts legs were fighting
in his mouth like this.

859
00:59:26,708 --> 00:59:29,233
Everything l had
is in that restaurant.

860
00:59:29,411 --> 00:59:31,675
lt´s not that bad.
l have my job.

861
00:59:31,847 --> 00:59:34,782
Your teacher´s salary
won´t pay for the toilet paper!

862
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:37,350
That´s because they don´t
pay teachers what they´re worth.

863
00:59:37,519 --> 00:59:38,850
ln some parts of the world--

864
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:40,351
Linda, don´t go there.

865
00:59:40,522 --> 00:59:43,582
Do you mind if we don´t have
this discussion again right now?

866
00:59:43,758 --> 00:59:45,225
Thank you, Anton.

867
00:59:45,393 --> 00:59:46,724
Don´t be angry.

868
00:59:46,895 --> 00:59:48,089
l´m not angry.

869
00:59:48,263 --> 00:59:50,663
She´s angry.

870
00:59:50,832 --> 00:59:52,197
What if they close me down
permanently?

871
00:59:52,367 --> 00:59:53,493
What would you do?

872
00:59:53,668 --> 00:59:56,603
What do you mean?

873
00:59:56,771 --> 01:00:00,673
l mean, if l couldn´t afford
this nice place anymore?

874
01:00:02,277 --> 01:00:04,108
You can always find work.

875
01:00:04,279 --> 01:00:05,769
You can go back to modeling...

876
01:00:05,947 --> 01:00:08,643
He was a model?

877
01:00:08,817 --> 01:00:10,148
What if l couldn´t find work?

878
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:14,846
Then what?

879
01:00:15,023 --> 01:00:18,083
What would you do
if l were poor?

880
01:00:22,564 --> 01:00:26,398
l would sit out on the curb
with you all day...

881
01:00:26,568 --> 01:00:28,536
and sell pencils.

882
01:00:28,703 --> 01:00:30,295
Then when it got dark,
we would crawl...

883
01:00:30,472 --> 01:00:36,536
into our cozy refrigerator box
and make love all night...

884
01:00:36,711 --> 01:00:40,010
and then sell pencils again
at sun-up.

885
01:00:44,419 --> 01:00:46,114
Where are you going?

886
01:00:46,288 --> 01:00:47,277
Where´s he going?

887
01:00:47,455 --> 01:00:49,446
What´s he doing?

888
01:00:50,492 --> 01:00:51,481
Talk to me.

889
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:53,594
He´s getting something
off of a shelf.

890
01:00:53,762 --> 01:00:55,252
What is it?

891
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:57,261
lt´s a ring. Oh, no...

892
01:00:57,432 --> 01:00:58,831
What does it look like?

893
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,331
lt´s a circle of diamonds
with a...

894
01:01:00,502 --> 01:01:03,300
A big, fat opal in the middle?

895
01:01:03,471 --> 01:01:05,200
l´m familiar with it.

896
01:01:10,045 --> 01:01:11,842
What is that?

897
01:01:12,013 --> 01:01:14,004
-The bastard.
-What?

898
01:01:18,587 --> 01:01:20,521
Would you like to be my wife?

899
01:01:56,591 --> 01:01:57,819
Here.

900
01:02:03,598 --> 01:02:05,725
Nana!

901
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:09,131
So you found me.

902
01:02:09,304 --> 01:02:13,138
l get 50 pounds of flowers
delivered to my door...

903
01:02:13,308 --> 01:02:15,435
and l call the florist...

904
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:20,047
and he gives me your name
and this charming address...

905
01:02:20,215 --> 01:02:23,150
and the earrings
and the perfume...

906
01:02:23,318 --> 01:02:24,945
and the television set,
for Christ´s sake.

907
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:27,748
What´s got into your head, girl?

908
01:02:27,922 --> 01:02:29,219
Too much? You didn´t like them?

909
01:02:29,391 --> 01:02:32,258
lt´s one thing not to call
your mother for ages...

910
01:02:32,427 --> 01:02:34,292
but to hide from me
for two months.

911
01:02:34,462 --> 01:02:36,020
You better be found
lying dead in the gutter...

912
01:02:36,197 --> 01:02:38,256
if you know what´s good for you.

913
01:02:38,433 --> 01:02:41,061
What is that? Your tits
look like hard little rocks.

914
01:02:41,236 --> 01:02:44,205
Cut it out.

915
01:02:44,372 --> 01:02:47,341
As for you...

916
01:02:47,509 --> 01:02:50,842
taking my little girl
away from me.

917
01:02:51,012 --> 01:02:52,377
Come here now!

918
01:02:59,921 --> 01:03:01,752
l´m Margaret´s Nana.

919
01:03:01,923 --> 01:03:05,359
lt´s such a pleasure
to finally meet you, Anton.

920
01:03:08,029 --> 01:03:10,259
l´m very happy
to finally be meeting you, too.

921
01:03:10,432 --> 01:03:14,266
lf we hurry, we can get you
some vanilla custard...

922
01:03:14,436 --> 01:03:16,301
at Di Roberti´s
before it closes.

923
01:03:18,239 --> 01:03:20,537
The spoon
goes in right side up, dear.

924
01:03:20,709 --> 01:03:22,734
We weren´t brought up
in a barn.

925
01:03:22,911 --> 01:03:25,709
Nana, you got something
in your teeth right here.

926
01:03:27,515 --> 01:03:28,914
Here, hand them to me.

927
01:03:29,084 --> 01:03:30,881
Oh, you little bitch!

928
01:03:33,421 --> 01:03:35,013
Oh, dear, it´s late.

929
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:36,418
l think
l better be getting home.

930
01:03:36,591 --> 01:03:38,684
You have to go already?

931
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:41,351
l´ve got a yoga class
in the morning.

932
01:03:41,529 --> 01:03:43,053
But first,
l want to take your picture.

933
01:03:43,231 --> 01:03:44,425
Move in closer.

934
01:03:47,102 --> 01:03:48,729
Put your arm around her, Anton.

935
01:03:48,903 --> 01:03:50,928
Put your arm around her.

936
01:03:51,106 --> 01:03:52,937
Maggie, don´t make a face.

937
01:03:53,108 --> 01:03:54,370
l´m not.

938
01:03:54,542 --> 01:03:56,237
She always makes a face
when you take her picture.

939
01:03:56,411 --> 01:03:57,878
l do not.

940
01:03:58,046 --> 01:04:02,005
For Pete´s sake,
just act natural.

941
01:04:02,183 --> 01:04:04,014
Why don´t you give her
a kiss, Anton?

942
01:04:07,055 --> 01:04:08,647
lt´s my mistake.

943
01:04:10,325 --> 01:04:12,259
Don´t be shy. Come on.

944
01:04:14,729 --> 01:04:16,663
You can do
better than that, Anton.

945
01:04:16,831 --> 01:04:19,925
Yeah, Anton,
you can do better than that.

946
01:04:25,673 --> 01:04:28,699
Did you see a flash?

947
01:04:28,877 --> 01:04:31,846
God, l hate these things.

948
01:04:32,013 --> 01:04:33,708
Come on, kiss.

949
01:04:42,824 --> 01:04:46,453
All right, Maggie, dear,
will you take care of the check?

950
01:04:52,801 --> 01:04:54,735
Just spend the night with us.

951
01:04:54,903 --> 01:04:56,768
ln that Bohemian hell hole?

952
01:04:56,938 --> 01:04:59,498
How long were you in our
hell hole before we got there?

953
01:04:59,674 --> 01:05:02,768
Not very long.
l just straightened up a little.

954
01:05:02,944 --> 01:05:04,002
Listened to the radio.

955
01:05:04,179 --> 01:05:05,305
What radio?

956
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,640
Oh, the radio.

957
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:09,682
What was on the radio?

958
01:05:09,851 --> 01:05:11,443
Some little radio play.

959
01:05:11,619 --> 01:05:13,484
More like a soap opera.

960
01:05:13,655 --> 01:05:16,123
l´m ashamed to admit
l listened to that silly thing.

961
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:18,486
-What was it about?
-Who cares?

962
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:20,252
l want to hear more
about the both of you.

963
01:05:20,428 --> 01:05:21,690
l´m interested, too.

964
01:05:21,863 --> 01:05:25,196
Let´s see,
it was two characters.

965
01:05:25,366 --> 01:05:27,630
A Frenchman and a girl.

966
01:05:27,802 --> 01:05:29,770
ln the beginning,
he´s on his way home...

967
01:05:29,938 --> 01:05:32,270
and she´s upset about something.

968
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:36,240
lt turns out she thinks
he´s having an affair.

969
01:05:36,411 --> 01:05:38,402
And he says,
''l didn´t, l didn´t!''

970
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:40,411
And she says,
''Well, how do you explain this?''

971
01:05:40,582 --> 01:05:44,018
and shows him some undergarments
she found in the couch...

972
01:05:44,185 --> 01:05:46,585
and some other things he can´t
explain, and he denies it.

973
01:05:46,754 --> 01:05:48,949
Then she says something
about monkeys.

974
01:05:49,123 --> 01:05:51,284
l really couldn´t follow that.

975
01:05:51,459 --> 01:05:52,653
And then there was silence
for a bit...

976
01:05:52,827 --> 01:05:54,761
and then he confesses.

977
01:05:54,929 --> 01:05:56,624
He what?

978
01:05:56,798 --> 01:05:58,163
He confesses.

979
01:05:58,333 --> 01:06:00,130
He was seeing another woman,

980
01:06:00,301 --> 01:06:02,701
an investor or something.
lt was a little confusing.

981
01:06:02,871 --> 01:06:03,963
Come on, let´s go!

982
01:06:04,138 --> 01:06:05,901
Then what happened?

983
01:06:06,074 --> 01:06:08,599
He starts crying and begging her
to forgive him...

984
01:06:08,776 --> 01:06:10,505
and she says
a certain four-letter word...

985
01:06:10,678 --> 01:06:12,475
more than a couple of times
and storms out.

986
01:06:12,647 --> 01:06:14,080
l didn´t know
you were so interested...

987
01:06:14,249 --> 01:06:15,511
in this kind of thing.

988
01:06:15,683 --> 01:06:18,413
We listen
to that show all the time.

989
01:06:19,587 --> 01:06:20,884
Watch your fingers.

990
01:06:22,891 --> 01:06:24,017
l´ve got it.

991
01:06:24,192 --> 01:06:25,352
Good.

992
01:06:25,527 --> 01:06:26,994
Look at him.

993
01:06:27,161 --> 01:06:28,321
All right.

994
01:06:38,606 --> 01:06:41,404
l can´t. l have to go.

995
01:06:41,576 --> 01:06:43,476
l´m waiting for a call. Shit.

996
01:06:44,512 --> 01:06:47,174
Who is it?

997
01:06:50,752 --> 01:06:53,050
Anton? l´m Mr. Green.

998
01:06:53,221 --> 01:06:55,052
Linda´s father.

999
01:06:55,223 --> 01:06:56,520
How are you? Come on.

1000
01:06:56,691 --> 01:06:59,023
Can l offer you something,
a cup--

1001
01:06:59,193 --> 01:07:02,822
''Anton, you hurt me very badly.

1002
01:07:02,997 --> 01:07:07,024
''All l asked for was honesty,
and you betrayed me.

1003
01:07:07,201 --> 01:07:08,998
''l had hoped...''

1004
01:07:10,438 --> 01:07:12,030
Ah, hell...

1005
01:07:16,044 --> 01:07:17,477
l can´t believe it. We did it!

1006
01:07:17,645 --> 01:07:19,704
Why?

1007
01:07:19,881 --> 01:07:21,712
We did it, Sam!

1008
01:07:23,918 --> 01:07:26,785
All this time, and we weren´t
even here for it.

1009
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:34,919
What are you going to do now?

1010
01:07:35,096 --> 01:07:37,257
She left suddenly, right?

1011
01:07:37,432 --> 01:07:40,765
So she probably
went someplace familiar.

1012
01:07:40,935 --> 01:07:43,267
To the hotel
where she was staying before.

1013
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,101
You´re probably right.

1014
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:50,177
What are you waiting for, Sam?

1015
01:07:50,345 --> 01:07:51,437
Go get her.

1016
01:07:51,613 --> 01:07:53,638
Now?

1017
01:07:53,815 --> 01:07:57,273
Yeah, now.
What´s the matter with now?

1018
01:07:57,452 --> 01:07:58,976
l can´t.
What would it look like?

1019
01:08:00,655 --> 01:08:03,123
Who cares?
She´s not thinking straight.

1020
01:08:03,291 --> 01:08:04,622
She´ll buy anything.

1021
01:08:04,792 --> 01:08:07,784
What´s the big hurry
to get me out of here?

1022
01:08:07,962 --> 01:08:11,193
Look, if you don´t want her
after all this...

1023
01:08:11,366 --> 01:08:13,561
Of course l do.

1024
01:08:16,571 --> 01:08:18,402
l don´t care about that.

1025
01:08:18,573 --> 01:08:19,835
lt´s your business.

1026
01:08:20,008 --> 01:08:21,908
l still got some work to do...

1027
01:08:22,076 --> 01:08:24,101
and, no offense,
but l really miss my privacy.

1028
01:08:24,278 --> 01:08:29,045
l thought we could just take
a minute to say good-bye.

1029
01:08:29,217 --> 01:08:31,378
l mean, it feels
kind of strange to not...

1030
01:08:47,435 --> 01:08:49,733
You have to wreck everything,
don´t you?

1031
01:08:49,904 --> 01:08:52,600
Are we done
saying good-bye yet?

1032
01:08:56,244 --> 01:08:57,734
You´re still here.

1033
01:09:14,228 --> 01:09:16,287
No, she does not want
to see you.

1034
01:09:16,464 --> 01:09:17,795
You are not welcome.

1035
01:09:17,965 --> 01:09:21,059
You try and sneak in here again,
and you´re going to jail.

1036
01:09:21,235 --> 01:09:23,601
How dare you, you bastard?

1037
01:09:23,771 --> 01:09:25,705
l rape your skull!

1038
01:09:26,741 --> 01:09:28,902
Dishwasher!

1039
01:09:30,812 --> 01:09:32,279
l knew it was you.

1040
01:09:32,447 --> 01:09:33,471
Anton, hi.

1041
01:09:33,648 --> 01:09:35,878
ls that any kind of greeting
for your old boss?

1042
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:36,948
How are you?

1043
01:09:37,118 --> 01:09:38,949
l´ve never been better.

1044
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:42,681
Every day is a holiday,
every night the Fourth of July.

1045
01:09:42,857 --> 01:09:46,588
Oh, good.
Well, l better be going.

1046
01:09:46,761 --> 01:09:48,956
l´m lying.

1047
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:50,688
l feel terrible.

1048
01:09:50,865 --> 01:09:52,560
l broke up with my fiancée.

1049
01:09:52,734 --> 01:09:55,259
My restaurant is gone,
and l´m running out of money.

1050
01:09:56,571 --> 01:09:58,766
l´m sorry.

1051
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:00,840
Don´t worry. Don´t be sorry.

1052
01:10:01,008 --> 01:10:02,168
Do you have a place yet?

1053
01:10:02,343 --> 01:10:03,332
Not yet.

1054
01:10:03,511 --> 01:10:05,138
You´ll stay with me, then.

1055
01:10:05,313 --> 01:10:06,371
Why?

1056
01:10:06,547 --> 01:10:07,844
You don´t even know me.

1057
01:10:08,015 --> 01:10:09,346
l know one thing.

1058
01:10:09,517 --> 01:10:10,848
That last night
at the restaurant...

1059
01:10:11,018 --> 01:10:13,350
everyone is running around,
even me...

1060
01:10:13,521 --> 01:10:15,011
but l notice you
in your little room.

1061
01:10:15,189 --> 01:10:16,588
You were not looking out...

1062
01:10:16,758 --> 01:10:18,692
you were not staring stupidly
like the rest.

1063
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:21,090
You just kept working
like a rock.

1064
01:10:21,262 --> 01:10:23,389
You´re a good man, good friend.

1065
01:10:23,564 --> 01:10:25,122
What´s your name, by the way?

1066
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:28,530
Mike, l´m a nervous wreck.

1067
01:10:28,703 --> 01:10:30,534
l´m not doing well on my own.

1068
01:10:30,705 --> 01:10:31,729
l feel vide.

1069
01:10:31,906 --> 01:10:33,703
lt´s like somebody
has thrown away a piece of me.

1070
01:10:33,875 --> 01:10:35,342
How do you say vide...

1071
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:37,410
when there is nothing
inside something?

1072
01:10:37,578 --> 01:10:39,068
Hollow.

1073
01:10:39,247 --> 01:10:42,774
Yeah. That´s how l feel.

1074
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:45,612
l feel so hollow.

1075
01:10:45,787 --> 01:10:47,880
You would be doing me
a favor, really.

1076
01:10:48,055 --> 01:10:49,352
Just one drink.

1077
01:10:49,524 --> 01:10:52,186
l can´t go back to
that empty apartment by myself.

1078
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:55,261
l will die. Please.

1079
01:10:55,429 --> 01:10:57,863
That´s it. No more.

1080
01:10:58,032 --> 01:10:59,761
You must try this one next.

1081
01:10:59,934 --> 01:11:02,164
lt´s a sexy little Margaux
from ´83.

1082
01:11:02,336 --> 01:11:03,928
l was going to give it
to Matheson...

1083
01:11:04,105 --> 01:11:06,505
to help wash down the bugs.

1084
01:11:06,674 --> 01:11:09,768
Mike, l don´t know
how she found out.

1085
01:11:09,944 --> 01:11:12,378
l was going to tell this
other woman good-bye, anyway.

1086
01:11:12,547 --> 01:11:14,981
l only slept with her to help
the loan for my restaurant.

1087
01:11:15,149 --> 01:11:16,810
lt´s not like l cheated,
you know...

1088
01:11:16,984 --> 01:11:18,849
and it was only once
with this woman.

1089
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:20,248
And l hardly came at all...

1090
01:11:20,421 --> 01:11:21,979
just a fraction
of what l´m capable.

1091
01:11:23,424 --> 01:11:25,289
l thought of Linda
the entire time.

1092
01:11:25,459 --> 01:11:27,051
lf that can be twisted
into something terrible...

1093
01:11:27,228 --> 01:11:30,595
l´m surely the only sane man
in a world gone mad.

1094
01:11:32,099 --> 01:11:33,726
Don´t you think?

1095
01:11:34,936 --> 01:11:37,427
l really couldn´t say, Anton.

1096
01:11:39,907 --> 01:11:42,239
l´m going to get her back, Mike.

1097
01:11:43,811 --> 01:11:45,574
She needs me.

1098
01:11:45,746 --> 01:11:47,407
l have to get her back.

1099
01:11:47,582 --> 01:11:49,243
This is really good.

1100
01:11:51,519 --> 01:11:53,646
l´m sorry. lt is.

1101
01:11:53,821 --> 01:11:56,255
Time for bed.

1102
01:11:56,424 --> 01:11:58,289
l have modeling work
waiting for me tomorrow.

1103
01:11:58,459 --> 01:12:02,395
A step down, yes,
but Anton Depeux isn´t proud.

1104
01:12:02,563 --> 01:12:04,394
Look at me, Mike.

1105
01:12:04,565 --> 01:12:08,331
l haven´t gained a pound
since my modeling days.

1106
01:12:11,372 --> 01:12:13,772
l´m going to be just fine,
and you don´t worry about me.

1107
01:12:15,309 --> 01:12:17,174
l guess
l better be moseying on, then.

1108
01:12:17,345 --> 01:12:18,573
Let you get your beauty rest.

1109
01:12:20,314 --> 01:12:21,576
Please, a little longer.

1110
01:12:21,749 --> 01:12:23,341
You know, the crème caramel
is almost done...

1111
01:12:23,517 --> 01:12:25,985
and l have a very nice wine
for my friend here.

1112
01:12:26,153 --> 01:12:28,519
l´ll be right back.
Here you go. Please.

1113
01:12:28,689 --> 01:12:29,917
Wait there.

1114
01:12:40,534 --> 01:12:42,502
Maggie, come to the window.

1115
01:12:42,670 --> 01:12:44,535
Please, this wasn´t my idea.

1116
01:12:44,705 --> 01:12:46,502
Maggie, don´t be angry with me.

1117
01:12:48,876 --> 01:12:52,607
Maggie, look at him.
How could l leave him?

1118
01:13:01,889 --> 01:13:04,983
l haven´t done this in years.

1119
01:13:05,159 --> 01:13:06,990
How is it in English?

1120
01:13:07,161 --> 01:13:09,026
Our Father, who art in heaven...

1121
01:13:09,196 --> 01:13:11,994
Our Father, who art in heaven...
l miss my father.

1122
01:13:12,166 --> 01:13:13,997
Hallowed be Thy name...

1123
01:13:14,168 --> 01:13:18,161
Hollow...hollow--

1124
01:13:18,339 --> 01:13:22,275
Hallowed be Thy name...

1125
01:13:56,243 --> 01:13:58,234
Stay out of my business.

1126
01:14:23,838 --> 01:14:26,602
After you, Abner...and Evelyn.

1127
01:14:26,774 --> 01:14:29,402
Marching good.
We´re being a snake.

1128
01:14:29,577 --> 01:14:31,841
A snake. We´re looking good.

1129
01:14:32,013 --> 01:14:34,447
Now be an elephant.

1130
01:14:37,418 --> 01:14:39,409
And marching and two and...

1131
01:14:52,666 --> 01:14:55,134
Oh, my God!

1132
01:14:55,302 --> 01:14:57,202
Sam, it is you.

1133
01:15:02,309 --> 01:15:04,470
You´re here because of me?

1134
01:15:11,152 --> 01:15:14,121
God, Sam, l can´t believe
you´re actually here with me.

1135
01:15:14,288 --> 01:15:15,619
l can´t, either.

1136
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:18,588
lf only you knew
what l´ve been going through...

1137
01:15:18,759 --> 01:15:20,249
the last couple of days.

1138
01:15:20,428 --> 01:15:23,556
Listen to me,
feeling sorry for myself.

1139
01:15:23,731 --> 01:15:25,289
You know what l miss?

1140
01:15:25,466 --> 01:15:26,455
l miss noon.

1141
01:15:26,634 --> 01:15:27,623
Me, too.

1142
01:15:27,802 --> 01:15:31,465
Sometimes l look up
and wave at the sky.

1143
01:15:31,639 --> 01:15:34,005
-The kids think l´m nuts.
-l know.

1144
01:15:34,175 --> 01:15:36,040
Of course you do.

1145
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:38,906
You´ve been watching me
through your telescope...

1146
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:40,877
all the way from Archer´s Bluff.

1147
01:15:41,048 --> 01:15:43,949
Sam, you´re the best.

1148
01:15:44,118 --> 01:15:45,642
How could l ever leave you?

1149
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:47,219
What was l thinking?

1150
01:15:47,388 --> 01:15:48,719
Why did you?

1151
01:15:48,889 --> 01:15:50,186
l don´t know. l´m nuts.

1152
01:15:50,357 --> 01:15:51,824
That´s what my father says.

1153
01:15:51,992 --> 01:15:53,459
That´s not a real answer.

1154
01:15:53,627 --> 01:15:56,118
l know.

1155
01:16:00,301 --> 01:16:03,099
Why did l ever leave you, Sam?

1156
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:08,003
You´re so generous and kind
and honest.

1157
01:16:08,175 --> 01:16:11,110
Linda, you don´t know
everything about me.

1158
01:16:11,278 --> 01:16:13,838
Of course l do.

1159
01:16:14,014 --> 01:16:16,005
You´re my Milky Way man.

1160
01:16:23,991 --> 01:16:26,323
You´re in love with that man?

1161
01:16:26,494 --> 01:16:28,052
You´re breaking my heart!

1162
01:16:28,229 --> 01:16:31,289
Get him off! Come on!

1163
01:16:35,669 --> 01:16:38,331
Kiss me, Sam, please.

1164
01:16:55,189 --> 01:16:57,248
l got a stud.

1165
01:16:58,692 --> 01:17:01,126
That l didn´t know.

1166
01:17:04,431 --> 01:17:06,763
Linda, let´s go!

1167
01:17:08,836 --> 01:17:11,066
l got to go.

1168
01:17:11,238 --> 01:17:12,705
Come to my hotel tonight.

1169
01:17:12,873 --> 01:17:15,068
The Evangeline, eight o´clock?

1170
01:17:15,242 --> 01:17:16,539
Eight o´clock. l´ll be there.

1171
01:17:16,710 --> 01:17:18,644
Let´s give that man a hand.

1172
01:17:18,812 --> 01:17:21,645
Thank you, thank you.

1173
01:17:25,419 --> 01:17:28,616
Go to hell!
Take anything you want.

1174
01:17:28,789 --> 01:17:30,381
Don´t forget the TV!

1175
01:17:30,558 --> 01:17:32,788
And don´t forget the sofa also!

1176
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:35,895
You fascist!

1177
01:17:36,063 --> 01:17:37,394
How dare you?

1178
01:17:37,565 --> 01:17:40,159
l´ll rape your skull,
you bastard!

1179
01:17:40,334 --> 01:17:42,029
Look out.

1180
01:17:42,203 --> 01:17:43,932
Anton, what´s going on?

1181
01:17:44,104 --> 01:17:45,401
Credit card bastards!

1182
01:17:45,573 --> 01:17:47,905
They say l owe them thousands.

1183
01:17:48,075 --> 01:17:49,337
l never used the card.

1184
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:51,307
Help me find my other shoe...

1185
01:17:51,478 --> 01:17:52,877
because if l find my other shoe,
l will be just fine.

1186
01:17:53,047 --> 01:17:55,242
l have a nice little
modeling job waiting for me...

1187
01:17:55,416 --> 01:17:57,247
with a nice little agency...

1188
01:17:57,418 --> 01:17:59,010
and after l get my money,
l´m going to go down...

1189
01:17:59,186 --> 01:18:02,747
and wipe it in their disgusting
credit card faces!

1190
01:18:02,923 --> 01:18:04,857
You can´t
keep Anton Depeux down...

1191
01:18:05,025 --> 01:18:07,118
because Anton Depeux
is going to be just fine!

1192
01:18:07,294 --> 01:18:10,786
Look at me now,
you credit card bastards!

1193
01:18:12,099 --> 01:18:15,660
What, a pimple?

1194
01:18:15,836 --> 01:18:18,270
Tell me it´s not a pimple.

1195
01:18:18,439 --> 01:18:20,737
ls it a rash or an allergy?

1196
01:18:20,908 --> 01:18:24,844
lt´s called a chronic allergy.

1197
01:18:25,012 --> 01:18:28,277
lt´s from food or mold,
like shellfish, strawberries--

1198
01:18:28,449 --> 01:18:29,677
Strawberries?

1199
01:18:29,850 --> 01:18:32,785
l haven´t touched any of...

1200
01:18:32,953 --> 01:18:36,286
of those...for years.

1201
01:18:36,457 --> 01:18:40,223
Well, can l get you
some ice or heat? Ointment?

1202
01:18:40,394 --> 01:18:43,090
Look! Look! Look!

1203
01:18:43,264 --> 01:18:45,289
l am...look...

1204
01:18:49,937 --> 01:18:51,268
There you go.

1205
01:18:54,008 --> 01:18:56,841
There you go, lover.

1206
01:18:57,011 --> 01:18:59,639
That´s what l want to hear.

1207
01:19:25,739 --> 01:19:28,401
Hold it! Stop!

1208
01:19:30,644 --> 01:19:31,633
We need to talk.

1209
01:19:31,812 --> 01:19:33,074
So how was your date with Linda?

1210
01:19:33,247 --> 01:19:35,238
You looked cozy.
l´m happy it worked out.

1211
01:19:35,416 --> 01:19:36,815
You were there?

1212
01:19:36,984 --> 01:19:38,315
l miss you, Sam.

1213
01:19:38,485 --> 01:19:39,679
We were like girlfriends.

1214
01:19:39,853 --> 01:19:42,686
This isn´t
about him anymore, is it?

1215
01:19:42,856 --> 01:19:44,118
Who, him?

1216
01:19:45,959 --> 01:19:48,291
You know,
call me a hopeless romantic.

1217
01:19:48,462 --> 01:19:50,293
l just hate
to let him out of my sight.

1218
01:20:00,641 --> 01:20:02,302
Where are you going?

1219
01:20:02,476 --> 01:20:04,307
Nothing worse can happen to me.

1220
01:20:04,478 --> 01:20:06,742
l have to see Linda.

1221
01:20:06,914 --> 01:20:08,142
This is very painful.

1222
01:20:08,315 --> 01:20:10,078
Maybe now isn´t a good time.

1223
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:11,478
You don´t look your best.

1224
01:20:11,652 --> 01:20:13,779
What if she´s seeing
another man, Mike?

1225
01:20:13,954 --> 01:20:16,923
Another man touching
her hair, her hips...

1226
01:20:17,091 --> 01:20:18,217
her pink panties.

1227
01:20:18,392 --> 01:20:20,223
Oh, God, her pink panties.

1228
01:20:20,394 --> 01:20:22,794
The one with the little--

1229
01:20:22,963 --> 01:20:24,362
You think me pathetic,
don´t you?

1230
01:20:24,531 --> 01:20:26,123
Yes, l do.

1231
01:20:28,168 --> 01:20:30,295
With Linda,
the worst moments of my life...

1232
01:20:30,471 --> 01:20:32,132
were the happiest
l´ve ever known.

1233
01:20:32,306 --> 01:20:36,640
Even as the world was crashing
around my shoulders...

1234
01:20:36,810 --> 01:20:39,278
l had the most extraordinary
times with her.

1235
01:20:39,446 --> 01:20:43,109
Yet l only knew her
a brief time.

1236
01:20:43,283 --> 01:20:44,944
Your woman,
how long do you know her?

1237
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:46,108
A few weeks.

1238
01:20:46,286 --> 01:20:47,947
A few weeks?
Love comes swift and hard.

1239
01:20:48,122 --> 01:20:50,147
Not a few weeks.
Since we were kids.

1240
01:20:50,324 --> 01:20:52,292
You just said a few weeks.

1241
01:20:52,459 --> 01:20:54,586
l did. l said that.

1242
01:20:54,762 --> 01:20:56,127
l didn´t say you didn´t.

1243
01:20:56,296 --> 01:20:57,957
But l did. l said that.

1244
01:20:58,132 --> 01:21:01,226
How did you two meet?

1245
01:21:01,402 --> 01:21:02,391
Common interests.

1246
01:21:02,569 --> 01:21:04,059
When will l meet her?

1247
01:21:04,238 --> 01:21:06,706
We´re actually
not together anymore.

1248
01:21:06,874 --> 01:21:08,307
You didn´t get along?

1249
01:21:08,475 --> 01:21:09,965
No. We had
a great time together.

1250
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:11,736
And what drove you apart?

1251
01:21:11,912 --> 01:21:12,901
Another guy.

1252
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:14,843
She loves another man?

1253
01:21:15,015 --> 01:21:17,415
No, she hates him.

1254
01:21:17,584 --> 01:21:19,643
She hates his guts.

1255
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:22,084
Anton, l´m sorry. l have to go.

1256
01:21:22,256 --> 01:21:24,554
You´re not coming with me
to see her?

1257
01:21:24,725 --> 01:21:26,022
You´re on your own, sport.

1258
01:21:42,709 --> 01:21:44,301
What in the world are you doing?

1259
01:21:44,478 --> 01:21:46,469
l didn´t even come close to him!

1260
01:21:54,822 --> 01:21:56,722
l´m so sorry, Anton.

1261
01:21:58,392 --> 01:21:59,791
l´m so sorry.

1262
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:02,087
Linda. Where is Linda?

1263
01:22:02,262 --> 01:22:03,194
lt´s all right. l´m here.

1264
01:22:03,363 --> 01:22:07,129
Linda Green!

1265
01:22:39,233 --> 01:22:40,131
Nice and slow.

1266
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:42,097
l got you.

1267
01:22:42,269 --> 01:22:43,759
Go back.

1268
01:23:13,867 --> 01:23:15,198
l almost killed him, Maggie.

1269
01:23:15,369 --> 01:23:17,064
l was trying to protect him
from somebody...

1270
01:23:17,237 --> 01:23:19,705
who l thought was you,
and l almost killed him.

1271
01:23:19,873 --> 01:23:22,103
l broke his arms and his ribs.

1272
01:23:22,276 --> 01:23:24,335
For what?

1273
01:23:24,511 --> 01:23:26,445
l was going to ask you
about that, Sam.

1274
01:23:26,613 --> 01:23:28,012
Not that l´m ungrateful.

1275
01:23:28,181 --> 01:23:29,773
Stop it, Maggie. Just stop it.

1276
01:23:29,950 --> 01:23:31,042
l was just curious about that.

1277
01:23:31,218 --> 01:23:33,311
This isn´t about him anymore.
This is about us.

1278
01:23:33,487 --> 01:23:34,476
You and me.

1279
01:23:35,656 --> 01:23:37,021
l love you, Maggie.

1280
01:23:37,190 --> 01:23:39,715
Oh, God, don´t do this.

1281
01:23:39,893 --> 01:23:40,860
l love you.

1282
01:23:41,028 --> 01:23:42,518
What are you doing?

1283
01:23:42,696 --> 01:23:43,924
And l know you love me.

1284
01:23:44,097 --> 01:23:45,291
Why are you saying that?

1285
01:23:45,465 --> 01:23:47,456
- l know you love me.
- Don´t do this, Sam.

1286
01:23:47,634 --> 01:23:48,794
You´re crazy about me.

1287
01:23:48,969 --> 01:23:51,164
You should go home.
Just get on a plane and go.

1288
01:23:51,338 --> 01:23:53,772
l won´t hurt you, Maggie,
l swear.

1289
01:23:53,941 --> 01:23:57,604
Look, l am trying to be nice,
and you...

1290
01:24:00,047 --> 01:24:02,015
l don´t love you, Sam.

1291
01:24:02,182 --> 01:24:04,673
l don´t have one iota of feeling
for you whatsoever.

1292
01:24:04,851 --> 01:24:06,148
Then what were you doing
this morning...

1293
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:07,753
watching me and Linda?

1294
01:24:07,921 --> 01:24:09,252
He wasn´t there.

1295
01:24:09,423 --> 01:24:10,788
Why were you there?

1296
01:24:10,958 --> 01:24:13,552
lt´s none of your business
anymore what l do or why.

1297
01:24:13,727 --> 01:24:17,857
You were there watching me
because you care about me...

1298
01:24:18,031 --> 01:24:19,692
because
you have feelings for me.

1299
01:24:22,669 --> 01:24:24,603
You want to know
why l was there, Sam?

1300
01:24:24,771 --> 01:24:27,433
You really want to know?
Pictures.

1301
01:24:27,608 --> 01:24:30,099
Pictures of you and Linda.

1302
01:24:30,277 --> 01:24:32,108
l told you l want him
finished off.

1303
01:24:32,279 --> 01:24:34,611
lt doesn´t have anything to do
with you and me.

1304
01:24:34,781 --> 01:24:37,045
l told you, stay out of my way.

1305
01:24:40,487 --> 01:24:41,784
That´s it?

1306
01:24:41,955 --> 01:24:43,786
lf that´s what you want,
that´s what it´s going to take.

1307
01:24:43,957 --> 01:24:48,326
Fine. Let´s get it
the hell over with, then.

1308
01:25:08,849 --> 01:25:10,180
Thank God, Mike.

1309
01:25:10,350 --> 01:25:11,874
Thank God you´re back.

1310
01:25:12,052 --> 01:25:13,679
Scratch me, Mike, please.

1311
01:25:13,854 --> 01:25:15,651
Scratch my chest,
my face, quickly.

1312
01:25:15,822 --> 01:25:17,653
Why?

1313
01:25:17,824 --> 01:25:19,883
Please, l´m not kidding.
l can´t stand it.

1314
01:25:20,060 --> 01:25:21,288
Why should l help you?

1315
01:25:21,461 --> 01:25:23,520
For the love of God, Mike!

1316
01:25:23,697 --> 01:25:25,597
What did you do, Anton?

1317
01:25:25,766 --> 01:25:28,428
You must have done something
terrible to deserve all this.

1318
01:25:28,602 --> 01:25:30,160
What did you do?

1319
01:25:30,337 --> 01:25:32,965
l don´t understand
what you´re talking about.

1320
01:25:33,140 --> 01:25:34,471
Confess, Anton!

1321
01:25:34,641 --> 01:25:36,836
Have you gone mad?

1322
01:25:37,010 --> 01:25:38,500
l´m begging you.

1323
01:25:38,679 --> 01:25:40,010
Just for a moment.

1324
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:41,977
Just one scratch.

1325
01:25:42,149 --> 01:25:44,242
Look at you. You´ve lost
everything you have.

1326
01:25:44,418 --> 01:25:47,444
Your money, your love,
your self-respect.

1327
01:25:47,621 --> 01:25:48,952
You´re broken, Anton.

1328
01:25:49,122 --> 01:25:50,714
You´re repulsive!

1329
01:25:51,892 --> 01:25:54,326
ls this what you want?
ls this enough?

1330
01:25:54,494 --> 01:25:56,485
No, huh? You want more?

1331
01:25:58,532 --> 01:25:59,521
All right.

1332
01:26:01,935 --> 01:26:04,768
Do it, Anton. Confess.

1333
01:26:04,938 --> 01:26:05,927
Confess what?

1334
01:26:06,106 --> 01:26:07,733
That you hurt people!

1335
01:26:07,908 --> 01:26:10,604
Who, Linda?
Yes, l cheated on Linda.

1336
01:26:10,777 --> 01:26:14,304
l admit it,
but why should you care?

1337
01:26:14,481 --> 01:26:15,743
You were using her, weren´t you?

1338
01:26:15,916 --> 01:26:17,747
What are you talking about?

1339
01:26:17,918 --> 01:26:19,476
Just admit it!

1340
01:26:19,653 --> 01:26:21,348
That you were using her
to stay in this country...

1341
01:26:21,521 --> 01:26:23,011
just the way you used Maggie!

1342
01:26:38,338 --> 01:26:41,796
l never told you anything
about Maggie.

1343
01:26:43,777 --> 01:26:46,143
Who the hell are you?

1344
01:26:47,214 --> 01:26:49,512
l´m the Milky Way man...

1345
01:26:49,683 --> 01:26:52,743
and l know everything.

1346
01:26:59,159 --> 01:27:00,592
You´re going to hurt yourself.

1347
01:27:06,967 --> 01:27:07,991
You´re killing yourself.

1348
01:27:08,168 --> 01:27:09,430
Here. Let me help you.

1349
01:27:20,313 --> 01:27:23,646
How´s this?
You enjoying the show?

1350
01:28:31,184 --> 01:28:34,176
Maggie was my angel.

1351
01:28:36,823 --> 01:28:40,554
She brought me here,
in America.

1352
01:28:40,727 --> 01:28:43,025
l was nothing before l met her.

1353
01:28:43,196 --> 01:28:48,361
Just a waiter
in a little café in Paris.

1354
01:28:49,936 --> 01:28:53,201
Yeah. l used her.

1355
01:28:53,373 --> 01:28:55,603
l used her terribly.

1356
01:28:55,775 --> 01:28:58,869
But l didn´t think it
mattered...

1357
01:29:00,714 --> 01:29:02,375
because l was...

1358
01:29:02,549 --> 01:29:06,007
sure that l would grow
to love her.

1359
01:29:08,655 --> 01:29:13,354
l thought if l could just
love her, then...

1360
01:29:13,526 --> 01:29:15,892
it would be all right.

1361
01:29:17,864 --> 01:29:19,855
The shame would go away.

1362
01:29:21,434 --> 01:29:24,232
You can´t choose
who you love, Mike...

1363
01:29:24,404 --> 01:29:26,463
or whoever the hell you are...

1364
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:29,006
and l love Linda.

1365
01:29:29,175 --> 01:29:30,972
l love Linda.

1366
01:29:36,283 --> 01:29:40,185
More than anything!

1367
01:29:48,862 --> 01:29:52,423
Who the hell do you think
you are to judge?

1368
01:29:52,599 --> 01:29:54,726
Who the hell
do you think you are?

1369
01:29:57,003 --> 01:29:58,766
l´m nobody, Anton.

1370
01:30:02,542 --> 01:30:03,566
l´m nobody.

1371
01:30:06,713 --> 01:30:08,476
Nobody to nobody.

1372
01:30:44,451 --> 01:30:47,614
Linda, we need to talk.

1373
01:30:56,696 --> 01:30:59,096
Hello? Yes, please.

1374
01:30:59,265 --> 01:31:03,861
l need to be scratched on
my face, my chest, and my back.

1375
01:31:04,037 --> 01:31:05,868
Please. Hello?

1376
01:31:09,009 --> 01:31:12,001
lt is an emergency call.
l swear.

1377
01:31:12,178 --> 01:31:14,169
Hello, mister?

1378
01:31:59,025 --> 01:32:00,185
Say we´re even.

1379
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:01,349
What?

1380
01:32:01,528 --> 01:32:02,995
Just say it.

1381
01:32:05,765 --> 01:32:07,665
Yes, we are even.

1382
01:32:07,834 --> 01:32:08,994
Good.

1383
01:32:13,073 --> 01:32:14,631
So how ya been?

1384
01:32:55,215 --> 01:32:57,547
Here! l´m here, Linda!

1385
01:32:57,717 --> 01:33:01,312
Oh, baby! Look at you!

1386
01:33:01,488 --> 01:33:03,683
Oh, God!

1387
01:33:03,857 --> 01:33:06,052
Oh, honey!

1388
01:33:06,226 --> 01:33:08,319
l love you.

1389
01:33:08,495 --> 01:33:11,123
You´re everything to me.

1390
01:34:17,864 --> 01:34:20,492
Bad dog! Go away!

1391
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:31,634
So l saw this episode
of Lassie today...

1392
01:35:31,804 --> 01:35:36,832
and Lassie was accused
of a crime she didn´t commit...

1393
01:35:37,010 --> 01:35:40,002
and the ranger was coming
to put her to sleep.

1394
01:35:42,715 --> 01:35:45,343
How´s Lassie
going to get out of this one?

1395
01:35:45,518 --> 01:35:49,682
Well, the little boy found out
that the ranger was coming...

1396
01:35:49,856 --> 01:35:52,689
and he told Lassie that...

1397
01:35:52,859 --> 01:35:55,020
that she had to go away,
far away.

1398
01:35:55,194 --> 01:35:56,991
For her own good.

1399
01:35:57,163 --> 01:35:59,688
But Lassie wouldn´t leave.

1400
01:35:59,866 --> 01:36:03,165
See, Lassie just couldn´t
leave the boy.

1401
01:36:05,405 --> 01:36:07,669
What did he do?

1402
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:10,775
He told her
that he never liked her.

1403
01:36:10,943 --> 01:36:13,309
He said, ''l hate you.

1404
01:36:13,479 --> 01:36:16,642
''l hate you, Lassie.
You´re a bad dog.

1405
01:36:16,816 --> 01:36:18,875
''l hope l never see you again.''

1406
01:36:19,052 --> 01:36:21,020
That must have made Lassie sad.

1407
01:36:21,187 --> 01:36:22,176
Yes, it did.

1408
01:36:22,355 --> 01:36:24,880
Lassie trotted off...

1409
01:36:25,058 --> 01:36:26,491
very sadly.

1410
01:36:28,961 --> 01:36:30,952
But you know what happened?

1411
01:36:33,032 --> 01:36:34,499
Lassie came home, Maggie.

1412
01:36:34,667 --> 01:36:37,636
Did the little boy make it with Lassie?

1413
01:36:40,740 --> 01:36:42,970
Yes, he did.

1414
01:37:09,736 --> 00:00:00,000
