1
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:44,663
Mamma mia, I can't see anything!

2
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:46,699
Where do I go now?

3
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,737
Madam is right. I should
buy myself some glasses...

4
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:56,547
but I look so awful in them,
and they make me look old!

5
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:02,046
I'll have to ask Madam
for a little light.

6
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,428
How beautiful you are!

7
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,804
Do butterflies make you happy,
Medoro?

8
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:21,430
Giving happiness...

9
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,702
...is the most beautiful thing
you can do in this world.

10
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,799
Isn't that true?

11
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,741
If something comes into the world...

12
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:29,144
...and doesn't make our lives
more pleasant...

13
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,274
...it might as well
not have been born at all!

14
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,787
How long do butterflies live,
Medoro?

15
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:39,120
They say that a butterfly
knows no suffering.

16
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:42,618
It lives one day in happiness
and then dies forever.

17
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:47,859
The only thing I don't like about
death is that you die for too long.

18
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:49,796
It would be better
the other way around.

19
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:50,892
What would that be?

20
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:56,135
If you died for just one day and
then lived forever in happiness.

21
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,776
Have you ever died, Medoro?

22
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:02,814
Oh, I still have to finish being born.

23
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:07,642
And anyway, time doesn't exist,
Madam Fairy.

24
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,917
You're right, Medoro,
time doesn't exist.

25
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,324
But let's go now.
It's getting late.

26
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,659
Yes. Well, I don't remember
the way very well.

27
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:22,731
You don't remember
or you can't see?

28
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:25,302
This is the last time
I'll ask you, Madam Fairy...

29
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:29,136
...could we have
a thread more light?

30
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:30,902
Just a little?

31
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,744
All right, Medoro.

32
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:45,420
Thank you, Madam Fairy.

33
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,758
Let's go, little mice!

34
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:45,483
Who is that?
- Get it! Catch it!

35
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:04,467
Here it comes again, over there!
We've got to catch it!

36
00:05:05,137 --> 00:05:06,570
Here it is!

37
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:18,615
Who is that?
- My persimmons!

38
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:24,147
Here it comes! I see it!
That's what it was!

39
00:05:24,256 --> 00:05:29,091
It's coming this way! Catch it!

40
00:05:31,897 --> 00:05:34,365
We've got to catch it!

41
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:37,594
You rascal! You scoundrel!

42
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,708
Yes, you really are
a nice-looking frame!

43
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:46,403
And now, you know what
I'm going to do?

44
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,538
I'm going to make you
a nice rose right here.

45
00:05:49,648 --> 00:05:52,139
You don't like the rose?
Oh, I knew it.

46
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,479
Then we'll make a daisy!

47
00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:59,748
For heaven's sake, what's that?
Such bad manners!

48
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,728
Whoever you are,
you're really very rude.

49
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,464
What is this?

50
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:12,530
Who does this belong to?

51
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:18,339
Just look. What a lovely
piece of wood.

52
00:06:19,144 --> 00:06:21,374
Lovely, really lovely!

53
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:24,446
I'll make a nice puppet...

54
00:06:26,485 --> 00:06:28,953
...one that can dance
and do flips...

55
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:32,450
...well-mannered
and obedient, though.

56
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,493
Yes, let's start
working right away.

57
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:38,390
I'll make the most beautiful
puppet in the world.

58
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:43,297
Come over here. You'll be
the staff of my old age.

59
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,441
Just look at what a lovely puppet
it's turning out to be.

60
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:53,835
It's as if it were
making itself.

61
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,869
Am I hurting you?

62
00:06:58,383 --> 00:07:00,544
No, it's not a very hard job.

63
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,684
You see how lovely
you're turning out to be?

64
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:07,054
Two nice big eyes...

65
00:07:07,726 --> 00:07:09,489
...some pretty black hair...

66
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,826
...and a cute little mouth
with a little tongue inside.

67
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:15,124
WOOD:. Will you let me try on your
yellow wig, Father, will you?

68
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,464
I've told you a thousand times
to be quiet!

69
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:22,003
I should have made
your tongue last!

70
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:26,067
And anyway, who told you
this is a wig?

71
00:07:28,046 --> 00:07:30,844
Can you really tell?
- You sure can.

72
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:33,884
It's a big old yellow wig that
could make you die laughing.

73
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:35,920
It looks like you have cornmeal
pudding on your head!

74
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:37,888
Be quiet, you impertinent boy!

75
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:42,218
Can you believe it? I haven't
even finished making you...

76
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:44,090
...and already you're being
disrespectful to your father!

77
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,695
You're starting off badly,
my boy!

78
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,094
And just be quiet for a minute!

79
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:50,730
All right, I'll be quiet.
I'll be quiet.

80
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:54,464
I won't talk anymore because
my fath... What's the matter?

81
00:07:58,143 --> 00:07:59,474
Oh, blessed saint Anthony!

82
00:08:00,345 --> 00:08:01,573
He talks!

83
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,443
Yes, he talks!

84
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:07,509
I really do think
I heard him talk!

85
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:11,547
But let's try something.

86
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:17,760
How are you?
- Fine, Geppetto. And you?

87
00:08:18,597 --> 00:08:20,827
Very well, very well, thank you.

88
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:24,162
Thank goodness
he doesn't talk.

89
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:28,998
Just what I was saying. How
could it be possible that a puppet...?

90
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:30,540
Hey, Father, close that door.

91
00:08:30,642 --> 00:08:33,304
I'm all naked and there's
a draft in here, mamma mia!

92
00:08:34,813 --> 00:08:37,805
A puppet that knows
how to talk.

93
00:08:39,718 --> 00:08:43,552
Stop that, Father, you're
tickling me. No, no, stop that!

94
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:46,484
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I present to you....

95
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,190
That's right.
What name shall I give you?

96
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:54,189
Well, you came from pine wood.
I'll call you Pinocchio!

97
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:56,995
Nice name, it appeals!
- What a lovely puppet you are!

98
00:08:57,102 --> 00:08:59,627
Your little shoes and little pants
are splendid.

99
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:01,137
Now, the finishing touch.

100
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:04,838
A hat made of bread crumbs,
painted by me!

101
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:09,374
Wait!
- I like this one better!

102
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,882
Father! There are
so many things in here!

103
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:15,049
What's this? What's this called?

104
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:16,781
Stop! Pinocchio, be careful!
Come here!

105
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:20,390
Where are you going, Pinocchio?
Come here! My hair!

106
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,624
No one knows I wear a wig!

107
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,325
Be careful! You're going
to hurt yourself!

108
00:09:30,035 --> 00:09:32,503
Here's father's chair,
father's little table...

109
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,072
...father's whatchamacallit!

110
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,096
What do you see
out of that window?

111
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:37,674
Can I take a look, yes or no?

112
00:09:37,776 --> 00:09:41,872
Oh, good God!
Where are you going? Get down!

113
00:09:42,147 --> 00:09:45,810
Careful, Father! Jump!
Bye, Father! See you later!

114
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:50,113
I should have thought of this before.
Where are you going?

115
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,554
It's so beautiful out there, Father!
Come and see! Bye!

116
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:55,126
Don't go outside!
It's dangerous! Torna indietro!

117
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:10,809
What's that?
- Out of the way, puppet!

118
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,110
A puppet?
- What the heck is that?

119
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,850
Pinocchio!

120
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,613
Pinocchio!

121
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,849
Pinocchio! Pinocchio!

122
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,423
Who is it?

123
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,199
Get out of the way!
- Get out of the way!

124
00:10:53,218 --> 00:10:55,379
You're going to pay me
for that wine now!

125
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:01,718
Got you!

126
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:07,361
Got you! Finally!
Who does this puppet belong to?

127
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:10,366
Let's figure out how much
there'll be to pay in damages!

128
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:13,666
Who does this puppet belong to?

129
00:11:13,772 --> 00:11:16,138
It's mine! That wig is mine,
thank you! It's mine.

130
00:11:16,241 --> 00:11:18,436
If you only knew what I've
been through! There was a goose...!

131
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:19,909
Quiet, puppet!

132
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,142
Pinocchio, my son?!

133
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,215
A fine father you are! This puppet
is a real pain in the neck!

134
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:26,306
What do you mean?

135
00:11:26,418 --> 00:11:28,716
I struggled so hard to make him
into a respectable puppet!

136
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:32,584
Respectable? He's turned the whole
city upside down! It's your fault!

137
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,126
He escaped from the house
before I even knew it.

138
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,320
That's bad!
You have to be more careful!

139
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:39,624
Only an idiot lets a puppet
escape from right under his nose!

140
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:42,796
Now this one's coming
to jail with us. Let's go!

141
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:47,500
Who's he?
- My son, where are you going?

142
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,868
No, you don't!
Are you trying to escape, too?

143
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:53,143
You come with us!
You've got some damages to pay...

144
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:55,509
...or else there's no avoiding
a night in jail for you. Let's go!

145
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:56,979
Wretched boy!

146
00:11:57,783 --> 00:12:00,149
A little bird! Hey, I see you!

147
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:04,119
Come here! Come here!
There are so many of them!

148
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,782
Here's a nest! A nest!

149
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:08,016
It's empty!

150
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,424
A squirrel!

151
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:12,988
It's so wonderful to be in
the world! This is really the life!

152
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,970
I'm going to warm myself up
a little. It's freezing.

153
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:26,068
What a great day I've had!

154
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:29,479
And now I'm so hungry,
I could eat the whole house up!

155
00:12:30,315 --> 00:12:31,748
There must be some place
where my father...

156
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,043
Pinocchio.
- What's that?

157
00:12:33,818 --> 00:12:37,049
It is I, Pinocchio,
the Talking Cricket!

158
00:12:37,956 --> 00:12:39,856
No! A talking cricket?

159
00:12:40,225 --> 00:12:41,283
Cricket, you don't
by any chance know...

160
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:42,519
...where my father keeps the cakes,
do you?

161
00:12:43,094 --> 00:12:46,461
Woe to those children who rebel
against their parents...

162
00:12:46,564 --> 00:12:47,963
...and run away from home.

163
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,691
They will never come
to any good in this world!

164
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,263
You're not talking to me, are you?
- Yes, I am.

165
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,699
Woe to you!
- Cricket, I'm getting out of here!

166
00:12:58,109 --> 00:13:01,169
Because if I stay, I'll have to do
what every other child does.

167
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:03,046
I mean, I'll have to go to school
and to study...

168
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:06,140
...and I don't have the slightest
desire to study! I just don't like it!

169
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:07,947
Poor little fool!

170
00:13:08,353 --> 00:13:09,843
You should know that if you do that...

171
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:12,213
...you'll become a fine jackass...

172
00:13:12,724 --> 00:13:14,954
...and everyone will laugh at you.

173
00:13:15,393 --> 00:13:17,190
Hey, Cricket, why don't you
shut up for a minute?

174
00:13:17,295 --> 00:13:18,523
You've got an annoying voice...

175
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:22,395
...and I really can't stand
to listen to it! It's really annoying!

176
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:25,535
Well, if you don't want to go
to school, at least go to work.

177
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:27,731
To work? Me?

178
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,303
That's right! There must be
some job that you like.

179
00:13:30,775 --> 00:13:35,178
Yes, there is one that I like.
There's one that I like a lot.

180
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,805
That's a good boy, Pinocchio.
You see?

181
00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:41,548
And what is this job?
- Eating, drinking...

182
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:43,018
...sleeping, having fun...

183
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:45,419
...doing whatever I like
from morning till night!

184
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:50,594
You're really a puppet,
and you'll always be a puppet!

185
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,894
And you're a bad-luck cricket, and
you'll always be a bad-luck cricket!

186
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:56,863
For your information, dear
Pinocchio, those like you...

187
00:13:57,435 --> 00:14:01,337
...always end up either in jail
or at the hospital.

188
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,937
You're really a nasty
bad-luck cricket! You really are!

189
00:14:07,712 --> 00:14:10,408
Those like me end up in jail
or in the hospital, do they?

190
00:14:12,183 --> 00:14:14,014
And those like you...

191
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,314
...you know where
they end up, Cricket?

192
00:14:16,821 --> 00:14:17,810
Where, Pinocchio?

193
00:14:18,156 --> 00:14:19,589
In the cemetery!

194
00:14:19,991 --> 00:14:21,652
Got you! Got you!

195
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,627
Hey, Pinocchio, what are you
doing with that hammer? Stop that!

196
00:14:24,729 --> 00:14:27,254
Got you! Got you! Got you!

197
00:14:32,837 --> 00:14:33,826
Where are you?

198
00:14:34,739 --> 00:14:37,606
I was joking. I didn't
really want to hurt you.

199
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:42,409
Where are you, little Cricket?
- All right, I'll trust you.

200
00:14:43,648 --> 00:14:45,445
Can I really trust you?
- I can't hear anything.

201
00:14:46,084 --> 00:14:48,382
There's an echo over there
where you're talking.

202
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,582
Couldn't you come a little closer?
- Where?

203
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:56,585
Well, for example, here!
Right here where I'm pointing.

204
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:59,392
That way we can talk.
- I'm coming, Pinocchio.

205
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:03,362
I'm coming, for I have
a great truth to tell you.

206
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,629
Those like you...
- Got you!

207
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:11,439
You fell for it! I'll teach you,
with your annoying voice...

208
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:12,908
I can't stand you!

209
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:16,176
Cricket, where are you?

210
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,676
I don't feel like playing anymore!

211
00:15:19,784 --> 00:15:22,651
I'm starving, I'm tired,
I'm dying for some sleep...

212
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:24,449
...I'm freezing, I'm starving.

213
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:26,023
Cricket, I'm starving!

214
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:30,151
What a horrible town!
What a horrible town!

215
00:15:31,262 --> 00:15:33,560
What a horrible town!

216
00:15:49,414 --> 00:15:50,938
Oh, God!

217
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,820
What is it? Father!
Dear Father!

218
00:15:58,289 --> 00:16:01,383
My dear little Pinocchio,
you were burning to pieces!

219
00:16:02,393 --> 00:16:05,851
If you only knew what I've been
through! I won't forget until I die.

220
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,088
What happened, Pinocchio?

221
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:09,195
It was raining. It was snowing.

222
00:16:09,534 --> 00:16:12,401
And you weren't there. I was
so hungry! Then the Cricket said:

223
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,597
"You deserve it. It serves you
right. You've been a bad boy!"

224
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:17,269
And you know what I did?
I hit him with a hammer!

225
00:16:17,442 --> 00:16:19,069
I did the right thing.
I said, "I'll teach you."

226
00:16:19,477 --> 00:16:22,275
At a certain point, I was tired,
I was hungry, I was sleepy.

227
00:16:23,081 --> 00:16:26,346
And you weren't there,
do you understand?

228
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:30,217
Then I sat near the fire to get
warm, and the fire burned me.

229
00:16:30,688 --> 00:16:31,985
Now I'm just
as hungry as ever...

230
00:16:32,223 --> 00:16:35,681
...and I don't have my little
suit of clothes anymore.

231
00:16:36,427 --> 00:16:38,952
Would you make me
a brand-new suit, Father?

232
00:16:40,098 --> 00:16:41,690
Why should I make you
another one?

233
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:45,402
So that you can run away again
and get me sent back to jail?

234
00:16:47,105 --> 00:16:50,199
I promise you that
from now on I'll be good.

235
00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:52,370
I'll go to school,
and I'll distinguish myself!

236
00:16:54,412 --> 00:16:55,504
Is that a promise?

237
00:16:56,381 --> 00:16:58,576
The promise of all promises.
No joke.

238
00:16:58,683 --> 00:17:01,880
I promise you with all my heart!
- Good boy, my son.

239
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:06,055
Here, take this! Look what
I have for you! It's a pear!

240
00:17:06,624 --> 00:17:09,184
It was going to be for my
breakfast tomorrow morning.

241
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:12,525
Eat it up, and may it do you good.
- What a nice pear!

242
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:17,027
Could you peel it for me?
- Peel it?

243
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:21,261
Yes, because I really
can't stand fruit peels.

244
00:17:21,406 --> 00:17:23,966
They really don't appeal!
- They don't appeal?

245
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,822
Father, Father!
Where have you been?

246
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:47,763
To buy you a brand-new spelling
book, so you can study! Here it is!

247
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:48,855
Nice!

248
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,393
But where's your jacket?
- I sold it!

249
00:17:53,738 --> 00:17:56,502
Why did you sell it?
- I was too hot in it.

250
00:18:11,656 --> 00:18:13,283
I'll never forget this!

251
00:18:13,391 --> 00:18:16,986
Now, you go to school and
make sure you distinguish yourself!

252
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:18,460
I promise you I will!

253
00:18:19,931 --> 00:18:22,866
Pinocchio, wait!
- What?

254
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:27,102
Your little hat made
of bread crumbs.

255
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:34,105
How does it look on me?
- It looks wonderful!

256
00:18:34,512 --> 00:18:35,979
Bye, I'm off to school!

257
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:39,016
Bye! I'll be waiting for you!
- Bye, Father!

258
00:18:40,218 --> 00:18:42,516
Today I want to learn to read...

259
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,111
...tomorrow I'll learn to write...

260
00:18:44,222 --> 00:18:45,883
...the day after tomorrow to do
arithmetic. Then I'll be all set.

261
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,125
What's this music?

262
00:18:50,261 --> 00:18:51,751
Excuse me, is that the school?

263
00:18:51,863 --> 00:18:53,831
The school's in the opposite
direction.

264
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,061
And what's this building?

265
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:58,067
It's written right there,
can't you see?

266
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,796
I'd be happy to read it.

267
00:18:59,904 --> 00:19:02,065
I don't know how to read today!

268
00:19:02,507 --> 00:19:05,340
A fine ox you are! It says,
"Grand Puppet Theatre."

269
00:19:06,544 --> 00:19:09,809
Bye, I'm going to school now.
- Excuse me.

270
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:11,842
I'm not interested myself...

271
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,612
...but if someone wanted to go,
how much would it cost to get in?

272
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:17,081
You'd need four pennies!

273
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:20,251
Would you buy my shoes
for four pennies?

274
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:21,347
No!

275
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:25,457
How about my hat, for four pennies?
- I said no! Bye!

276
00:19:28,566 --> 00:19:31,296
And this spelling book, that
my father sold his jacket for...

277
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,769
...in this freezing cold, would
you buy it for four pennies?

278
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,931
You're going to make me late
for school! That's enough!

279
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:39,139
I'll buy the spelling book
from you for four pennies.

280
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:40,609
Oh, thank you!

281
00:19:42,313 --> 00:19:44,338
Pulcinella!

282
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:48,380
Who's that calling me?

283
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,318
Were you the one
who took the salami?

284
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:55,792
No, no, no, no,
I didn't take any salami, Sir!

285
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,725
No, I saw you,
you're the one who took it!

286
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,662
Liar, that's not true. It wasn't
me who took the salami!

287
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:03,697
Liar!
- Thief!

288
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,635
In the name of the law,
who's the thief here?

289
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,136
It's him!
- It's him!

290
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:24,113
Silence! Celestial deities!

291
00:20:25,156 --> 00:20:26,282
Do I dream or wake?

292
00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:29,558
And yet, that looks like
a puppet down there!

293
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:30,753
It's him in person!

294
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:35,595
The puppet responsible for all
that commotion yesterday!

295
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:37,600
Wait, what's his name?

296
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,297
It's him in person!
It's Pinocchio!

297
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:45,370
Master, let's give Pinocchio
a grand welcome!

298
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,509
Come on, Pinocchio,
come up here...

299
00:20:48,613 --> 00:20:51,980
...and let your puppet brothers
give you a big hug!

300
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,749
All right, I'm coming!
Here I am...

301
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:58,687
...my dearest friends!

302
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:39,158
What's all this commotion?

303
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:45,503
And you, who are you?
You, who are you?

304
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:52,207
Why have you come and created
this confusion in my theater?

305
00:21:52,977 --> 00:21:56,071
Please believe me, most
illustrious Sir, it wasn't my fault.

306
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:57,273
-I was--
-Enough!

307
00:21:57,715 --> 00:21:59,808
We'll settle our score
at dinner!

308
00:22:03,421 --> 00:22:05,582
My apologies to the audience.

309
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,681
The show will be repeated tomorrow!

310
00:22:11,062 --> 00:22:12,222
Curtain!

311
00:22:33,651 --> 00:22:36,677
Harlequin, Pulcinella,
the water's boiling.

312
00:22:37,288 --> 00:22:39,552
Go get that puppet
hanging on the nail!

313
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:41,818
Today I'll eat him!

314
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:48,128
Obey me! I'm hungry!

315
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,191
What do you mean?

316
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,300
Have pity, most illustrious of
all illustrious sirs, Fire-Eater!

317
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,775
The idea of being eaten
doesn't appeal to me!

318
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:02,212
Father, I wanted to go
to school, I did--

319
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:08,910
Poor Father. If I die,
you'll die, too, dear Father!

320
00:23:17,762 --> 00:23:20,424
That's a good sign, Pinocchio!
Fire-Eater sneezed...

321
00:23:20,865 --> 00:23:22,856
...and when he sneezes it means
his heart was touched.

322
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:24,696
-And so?
-So that's good.

323
00:23:25,136 --> 00:23:28,037
When he is moved, his stomach
closes up, and no one gets eaten.

324
00:23:28,139 --> 00:23:29,868
You're safe!
Come on! Come on!

325
00:23:30,975 --> 00:23:33,944
Think of a way to move him.
Make him sneeze again.

326
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:40,912
What were you saying
about that poor father of yours?

327
00:23:41,786 --> 00:23:43,879
Are your parents alive?

328
00:23:45,356 --> 00:23:48,223
My father is, but I don't know
about my mother.

329
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:52,294
What sort of work does your father
do? How much does he make?

330
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:56,928
It's enough to make me cry.
My father doesn't do anything.

331
00:23:58,903 --> 00:24:01,599
Most illustrious Fire-Eater
of all Fire-Eaters!

332
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:05,832
My poor little father is
the poor man of all poor men.

333
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:09,836
Yesterday he came close
to eating a wig...

334
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:11,838
...because it looked
like cornmeal pudding.

335
00:24:12,283 --> 00:24:14,148
What a miserable family!

336
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,755
Do you have any brothers?
- No.

337
00:24:17,855 --> 00:24:20,585
Yes, one.
- And how's he doing?

338
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:28,131
He's doing well. I mean,
he's not well, not well at all!

339
00:24:28,499 --> 00:24:31,059
He's ill! Very ill!

340
00:24:31,502 --> 00:24:35,438
He's dead! He's dead!
Now I remember.

341
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,735
He died, then he died again.
He died twice.

342
00:24:41,846 --> 00:24:44,747
I have a brother
who's always dying.

343
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:49,276
Poor Father, he gave him
a funeral, but my father's so poor...

344
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:55,317
...that there was nothing there.
No people, not even the corpse.

345
00:24:57,028 --> 00:25:00,122
And a rich family that lives
next to us gave a funeral...

346
00:25:00,231 --> 00:25:03,394
...with seven, eight corpses,
because they're rich.

347
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:05,629
And my father,
not even one corpse!

348
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:21,507
Pinocchio, you're one terrific boy!

349
00:25:23,454 --> 00:25:27,015
Come here and give me a kiss.

350
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:49,846
Pinocchio, I really feel sorry
for that poor father of yours.

351
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,616
Here are five gold coins.

352
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:58,814
Take them to your father
and give him my best regards.

353
00:26:00,658 --> 00:26:04,059
Oh, five gold coins.
Thank you, most illustrious Sir!

354
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:05,652
So you're not going to eat me?

355
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:09,093
No, I won't be eating today.

356
00:26:18,342 --> 00:26:20,333
Now be quiet, or I'll make
a stew out of all of you!

357
00:26:29,186 --> 00:26:30,744
Good day, Pinocchio!

358
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:33,380
Good day, but how
do you know my name?

359
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,723
We saw your father
on his doorstep.

360
00:26:36,327 --> 00:26:40,024
He was in his undershirt,
trembling like a leaf with cold.

361
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:41,323
Poor old man!

362
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:43,761
I'll go see him right now.

363
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:47,269
From today on, he'll never
tremble with cold again.

364
00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:48,360
Why is that?

365
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:52,709
Why? Because I've become
a grand gentleman!

366
00:26:54,178 --> 00:26:55,577
A grand gentleman!

367
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,845
There's very little to laugh about.

368
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,246
If you understand
anything at all...

369
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:03,582
...these are five beautiful
gold coins.

370
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,525
Five gold coins!

371
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:16,867
-Five gold coins?
-Five gold coins?!

372
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,663
I'll knock him out,
and we'll take off with the loot!

373
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:22,296
I'll throw a stone at him,
a stone, a stone!

374
00:27:22,406 --> 00:27:24,601
Hold it! Not here!
Wait! Hold it!

375
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:26,633
Mister Pinocchio!

376
00:27:26,744 --> 00:27:29,508
Accept our apologies, we haven't
even introduced ourselves.

377
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:32,945
I am the Fox, and this is the Cat.

378
00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:35,044
Pleased to meet you, yes.

379
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:38,647
We're well-known around here
for being two respectable people.

380
00:27:38,756 --> 00:27:41,953
-People!
-I can see that, yes.

381
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:45,028
And you, you who are such
a good puppet...

382
00:27:45,696 --> 00:27:48,130
...what do you intend to do
with those five gold coins?

383
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,424
Do you intend to keep them
all for yourself?

384
00:27:51,635 --> 00:27:55,196
No. I want to buy a brand-new
jacket for my father...

385
00:27:55,906 --> 00:27:58,204
...and a spelling book for myself.

386
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:00,174
-For myself?
-For myself!

387
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:03,741
I want to go to school and study,
and earn an honest living...

388
00:28:04,048 --> 00:28:06,016
...studying and working.
Goodbye!

389
00:28:08,619 --> 00:28:12,885
-Studying and working!
-Studying and working!

390
00:28:13,357 --> 00:28:14,847
You're really a puppet!

391
00:28:15,626 --> 00:28:19,426
And to think that your five gold
coins could have become a thousand!

392
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,554
Two thousand!

393
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:22,762
Ten thousand!

394
00:28:24,635 --> 00:28:26,626
Ten thousand? But how?

395
00:28:28,305 --> 00:28:29,294
We'll tell you right now!

396
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,937
Instead of going home,
you'll have to come with us.

397
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,773
-With us!
-With you? Where to?

398
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,370
To a place where gold coins multiply.

399
00:28:37,481 --> 00:28:38,573
Multiply!

400
00:28:41,952 --> 00:28:45,115
-What's the name of this place?
-The Land of the Featherbrains.

401
00:28:45,222 --> 00:28:46,519
Come on!

402
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:48,588
In the Land of the Featherbrains...

403
00:28:48,692 --> 00:28:52,890
....there is a blessed field,
called the Field of Miracles.

404
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,197
What a wonderful place!
What a wonderful place!

405
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:59,603
You make a hole and put your
coins in. After half an hour...

406
00:28:59,703 --> 00:29:03,400
...a tree full of money comes up,
and all of a sudden you get rich.

407
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:08,305
But don't let anyone know!
It's a secret, keep it to yourself.

408
00:29:08,412 --> 00:29:11,006
To yourself!
- I'll keep it to myself!

409
00:29:11,115 --> 00:29:12,377
To myself!
- To yourself?

410
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:13,848
To yourself!
- To myself?

411
00:29:13,951 --> 00:29:15,009
To myself?
- To yourself?

412
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:16,916
To yourself!
- That's enough!

413
00:29:17,988 --> 00:29:19,012
I wasn't talking to you!

414
00:29:19,123 --> 00:29:20,420
Please do serve us.

415
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:24,257
The meat was very tasty.
My compliments!

416
00:29:24,628 --> 00:29:25,652
Tasty. My compliments.

417
00:29:25,963 --> 00:29:27,055
Thank you, friends!

418
00:29:27,531 --> 00:29:30,694
Pinocchio, you haven't touched
a thing yet! Eat your walnut!

419
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,662
Well, I'm not hungry.
I'm just not hungry!

420
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:35,500
Why don't we leave now?
Let's go!

421
00:29:35,606 --> 00:29:39,064
No, no, no, it's still early.
We have to get a little rest!

422
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,671
Innkeeper!
- Tasty!

423
00:29:42,646 --> 00:29:44,546
Show Mister Pinocchio
to his room...

424
00:29:44,648 --> 00:29:48,379
...and remember to wake us
all up at midnight!

425
00:29:49,453 --> 00:29:52,183
It's been a lovely little evening.
Get some rest now!

426
00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:53,381
Rest now!

427
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:56,723
-Off to bed, then?
-Yes!

428
00:29:56,827 --> 00:29:57,987
Well, then, good night!

429
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,126
-Good night!
-Night!

430
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:02,532
You know what?
I've changed my mind!

431
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:03,622
-No!
-No!

432
00:30:03,734 --> 00:30:10,230
As soon as I pick the gold pieces,
instead of keeping them for myself...

433
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:12,275
...I'll keep two thousand,
which is enough for me.

434
00:30:12,376 --> 00:30:16,039
And the rest I'll give to the two
of you as a present!

435
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:20,078
-Good heavens, no, Pinocchio!
-No!

436
00:30:20,184 --> 00:30:21,378
You're insulting us!

437
00:30:21,485 --> 00:30:23,976
You've got to give the money
to your father, who needs it.

438
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:27,819
The rest you can use to buy
a nice spelling book. Good night!

439
00:30:27,925 --> 00:30:31,554
-Book! Good night!
-Good night!

440
00:30:34,031 --> 00:30:36,625
-What good people!
-lf only there were more of them!

441
00:30:38,035 --> 00:30:40,230
A walnut.

442
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,505
Well, it's midnight.

443
00:30:50,214 --> 00:30:52,182
Where are my friends?
Aren't they ready?

444
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,508
They left two hours ago!

445
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:56,612
-Why?
-They told me:

446
00:30:56,721 --> 00:31:02,057
"Tell Pinocchio that we'll be waiting
for him under the Great Oak...

447
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,127
...at the break of day."

448
00:31:04,595 --> 00:31:05,857
Did they pay for the dinner?

449
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:09,095
You've got to be kidding! They
didn't want to slight you like that!

450
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:15,836
Too bad! It would have been a great
pleasure to receive such a slight!

451
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,101
-Here, take this.
-Thank you!

452
00:31:22,346 --> 00:31:24,439
Who is that over there?
Who is it?

453
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:34,453
Pinocchio.
- Who is it?

454
00:31:34,825 --> 00:31:38,022
It is I, the spirit
of the Talking Cricket!

455
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:41,223
Cricket! You really scared me.

456
00:31:41,565 --> 00:31:43,795
Weren't you supposed to be dead?
What do you want?

457
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:48,031
Don't trust those who promise
to make you rich overnight.

458
00:31:48,472 --> 00:31:50,667
They're either madmen
or swindlers.

459
00:31:51,008 --> 00:31:53,340
Go back!
- But I want to go on!

460
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:55,776
The hour is late.
- I want to go on!

461
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,542
The night is dark!
- I want to go on!

462
00:31:58,649 --> 00:32:01,379
The road is dangerous.
- I want to go on!

463
00:32:01,485 --> 00:32:05,581
Children who want to do things their
own way always end up regretting it.

464
00:32:05,689 --> 00:32:09,318
-The same old story. Good night.
-Good night, Pinocchio.

465
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:14,194
And may the heavens protect you
from dampness and assassins.

466
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,128
So now I'm supposed to be
in for all sorts of misfortunes?

467
00:32:19,236 --> 00:32:21,067
I'm even supposed
to meet up with assassins!

468
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:25,734
It's a good thing I don't believe
in assassins, and I never did.

469
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:28,937
You can just imagine
how scared I am of assassins!

470
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:31,606
-Your money or your life!
-The assassins!

471
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:34,577
-We've got to catch him!
-Help!

472
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,116
Out with your money or
you'll be in big trouble!

473
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:43,084
Out with your money or you're
dead, you understand?

474
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:46,162
Go get some of those
dry sticks over there.

475
00:32:46,263 --> 00:32:49,027
-We'll roast him!
-Let's burn him!

476
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,397
-Put them here, not there!
-There?

477
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:53,197
-Here!
-There, you mean!

478
00:32:53,637 --> 00:32:55,366
Light the fire!

479
00:32:55,706 --> 00:32:57,697
Look how it's burning!

480
00:32:57,908 --> 00:32:59,876
Out with the money, puppet!

481
00:32:59,977 --> 00:33:00,966
Where is he?

482
00:33:01,378 --> 00:33:03,243
-Did you see him?
-I saw him!

483
00:33:04,381 --> 00:33:07,145
-See you later!
-He's running away!

484
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:08,741
Get back here!

485
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:10,582
We've got to catch him!

486
00:33:21,832 --> 00:33:25,097
-You're on fire!
-I am! And so are you!

487
00:33:25,202 --> 00:33:27,102
Let's jump in, me over here
and you over there!

488
00:33:27,204 --> 00:33:30,230
-Me over there?
-Me over there and you over here!

489
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:33,943
They're going to catch me!
Help me! I'm going to die!

490
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,334
What's that?

491
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:39,507
If I could only get to that
little house, maybe I'd be safe!

492
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:42,408
I didn't get that,
over here or over there?

493
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,988
-Come on, jump in!
-Over here?

494
00:33:48,392 --> 00:33:52,328
Hey, is anyone home?
Is anyone home?

495
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:54,961
Open up, open up right now!

496
00:33:55,332 --> 00:33:57,163
Be quick about it!

497
00:33:57,334 --> 00:33:59,393
Wake up! Wake up!

498
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:04,704
Thank heavens, someone
is there after all! Open up!

499
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:11,979
There is no one in this house!

500
00:34:12,082 --> 00:34:13,845
Well, then, you open up for me!

501
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:16,245
I am not here, either!

502
00:34:16,887 --> 00:34:18,377
Then what are you doing up
there at the window?

503
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:23,853
No, don't go away, lovely lady
with the blue hair...

504
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:28,589
-The assassins are trying to get me!
-Now we're going to have some fun!

505
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:31,701
Please have pity...

506
00:34:31,802 --> 00:34:35,465
...on a poor puppet who's
being chased by assassins!

507
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,562
You won't get away from us now!

508
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:39,939
Out with your money
or you'll be in big trouble!

509
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:42,342
Lovely lady! Help!

510
00:34:42,446 --> 00:34:43,435
The coins!

511
00:34:43,647 --> 00:34:46,241
-I've got them in my mouth!
-Open your mouth!

512
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,011
-Never!
-You're stubborn.

513
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:05,258
Farewell, puppet!

514
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:09,862
When we come back tomorrow,
let's hope you'll be so polite...

515
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:12,374
...as to let us find you
with your mouth wide open...

516
00:35:12,476 --> 00:35:15,843
-...and, above all, dead!
-Dead.

517
00:35:30,527 --> 00:35:31,619
Oh, Father!

518
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:34,861
My Father!

519
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,532
If only you were here!

520
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:47,538
What a shame,
he was a fine puppet!

521
00:35:48,812 --> 00:35:50,677
Yes, he was a fine puppet!

522
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:53,742
-Good night, Madam Fairy.
-Good night, Medoro!

523
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:59,018
Madam Fairy,
there's an old man over here!

524
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:02,118
Yes, sir?

525
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:05,921
Medoro, that's you.
It's a mirror!

526
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:13,158
Well! Mirrors aren't what
they used to be!

527
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:51,969
Is he dead or alive?

528
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,575
I think he's dead.

529
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:13,763
It is my belief that the puppet
is already dead.

530
00:37:14,331 --> 00:37:16,822
But if by some stroke of
bad luck he were not dead...

531
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:20,392
...then it would be a sure
indication that he is still alive.

532
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,597
I am sorry to have to contradict
my illustrious colleague...

533
00:37:23,707 --> 00:37:25,732
...but in my opinion
the puppet is alive.

534
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:29,175
I know what sort of illness that
lousy puppet is suffering from!

535
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:33,146
He'll never become a respectable
boy! He'll always be a puppet!

536
00:37:33,617 --> 00:37:35,016
He's a consummate scoundrel!

537
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:37,714
He's going to break the heart
of his poor father...

538
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:40,750
...who's made so many
sacrifices for him.

539
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:42,792
-And he doesn't even love him!
-That's not true!

540
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:47,353
Oh, Father, it's not true!
It's not true!

541
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,330
I love my father.

542
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,630
Gentlemen, if a living person
is not dead...

543
00:37:52,736 --> 00:37:55,330
...it's a clear sign that doctors
are no longer needed.

544
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,240
Thank you for your enlightenment.

545
00:37:57,374 --> 00:38:00,366
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, Fairy.

546
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:03,837
This is the first case I've ever seen
of a dead person who cries.

547
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,974
I've never come across this before.
We'll need to reconsider everything.

548
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:10,417
He's alive, he's dead, everything
needs to be reconsidered.

549
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:11,579
He's burning.

550
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,093
Drink this, and in a few days
you'll be all better!

551
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:27,435
-ls it sweet or bitter?
-It's bitter, but it's good for you.

552
00:38:28,038 --> 00:38:29,403
If it's bitter, I don't want it!

553
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:31,938
Listen to me. Drink it!

554
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,741
I don't like bitter things!
They don't appeal at all!

555
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,010
Drink it, and when you're done,
I'll give you a lump of sugar...

556
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:41,482
...to take the bad taste away.

557
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:46,587
Well, first I want
the lump of sugar.

558
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:49,181
Then I'll drink that horrible,
bitter medicine!

559
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,689
Here you are!

560
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,559
Delicious!

561
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:05,540
I just-- I don't want to drink
this horrible, bitter water!

562
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,611
No, no, and no again!

563
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,374
-You'll be sorry, my boy.
-I don't care.

564
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,039
-You've got a serious illness!
-I don't care.

565
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,812
-lf you don't drink it you'll die.
-I don't care!

566
00:39:16,086 --> 00:39:19,578
-Aren't you afraid of death?
-Not at all afraid!

567
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:23,049
I'd rather die than drink that
horrible, awful medicine!

568
00:39:23,727 --> 00:39:25,695
I want to die!

569
00:39:32,569 --> 00:39:34,161
What's that?

570
00:39:35,805 --> 00:39:38,069
We have come
to take you away, Pinocchio.

571
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,170
To take me away?
What? But I'm not dead!

572
00:39:41,811 --> 00:39:46,180
But you will be if you don't drink
that medicine right away!

573
00:39:46,516 --> 00:39:48,780
But I wanted to drink it! She
didn't want to give it to me!

574
00:39:49,185 --> 00:39:51,881
Dear Fairy, give me
the medicine right away!

575
00:39:52,889 --> 00:39:55,983
Very well. This time we made
the trip for nothing.

576
00:39:56,092 --> 00:39:58,526
Never mind, we'll be back
some other time!

577
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:01,255
This bed is great for bouncing!

578
00:40:04,067 --> 00:40:05,932
I see the medicine
has done you some good.

579
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:08,664
Yes. Next time
I'll take it right away!

580
00:40:11,474 --> 00:40:13,965
I have something very
important to do now.

581
00:40:14,077 --> 00:40:15,101
Let me get my little hat.

582
00:40:15,912 --> 00:40:18,346
Thank you for dehanging me,
dear Fairy. Bye!

583
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,049
Wait, Pinocchio.

584
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:22,984
Come over here and tell me.

585
00:40:23,086 --> 00:40:26,055
-What did they want to hang you for?
-For the gold coins.

586
00:40:26,923 --> 00:40:29,118
And what happened
to the gold coins?

587
00:40:31,361 --> 00:40:32,988
I lost them.

588
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:39,999
-And where did you lose them?
-ln the forest nearby.

589
00:40:42,472 --> 00:40:45,703
If you lost them in the forest
nearby, let's go look for them!

590
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:50,379
Now that I remember better,
much better, dear Fairy...

591
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,040
...I didn't lose the coins! No!

592
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:54,712
Good boy, Pinocchio!

593
00:40:55,151 --> 00:40:57,346
I swallowed them, while I was
drinking your bitter medicine!

594
00:41:02,025 --> 00:41:06,689
-But why are you laughing?
-Because of the lie you told!

595
00:41:07,797 --> 00:41:09,526
How do you know
that I told a lie?

596
00:41:10,133 --> 00:41:12,624
Because lies, dear Pinocchio,
are of two types:

597
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:15,799
Those that have short legs...

598
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,330
...and those that have
a long nose!

599
00:41:18,808 --> 00:41:22,676
And mine, what type are they?

600
00:41:32,255 --> 00:41:33,552
But, dear Fairy!

601
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,126
Dear Fairy, do you see
what a nose I have?

602
00:41:38,194 --> 00:41:41,095
It's become so long,
so very long!

603
00:41:41,364 --> 00:41:43,457
Everyone will laugh at me!
They will!

604
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:47,394
How am I supposed to go out?
Look what a nose I've got!

605
00:41:48,071 --> 00:41:51,837
It doesn't appeal!
I don't want it, I don't want it!

606
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:54,934
The coins, dear Fairy...

607
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:56,342
...I didn't swallow the coins.

608
00:41:57,647 --> 00:41:59,012
They're right here!

609
00:41:59,516 --> 00:42:00,642
Good boy, Pinocchio.

610
00:42:01,084 --> 00:42:05,180
You mustn't ever tell lies.
It's a nasty thing.

611
00:42:09,225 --> 00:42:11,625
Yes, but, dear Fairy....

612
00:42:12,262 --> 00:42:17,165
-I do love you so!
-I love you, too, very much.

613
00:42:18,201 --> 00:42:22,228
I want to buy a jacket for my father,
since he sold his for me.

614
00:42:22,772 --> 00:42:25,138
Have him come here!
I can surprise him! Bye, Fairy!

615
00:42:25,241 --> 00:42:26,765
Bye! Come back soon!

616
00:42:27,343 --> 00:42:28,401
I'll be waiting for you.

617
00:42:29,946 --> 00:42:32,176
How did he manage to do that?

618
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:36,715
-Maybe someone cut the rope.
-Cut the rope.

619
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,015
-Yes. Incredible!
-Friends!

620
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:43,051
-It's Pinocchio! It's him!
-Wait, I'll handle this!

621
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:45,650
Dearest friends, oh, friends!

622
00:42:45,762 --> 00:42:47,389
You're just the ones
I was looking for!

623
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:51,028
Pinocchio, we've been waiting
for you for so long!

624
00:42:51,134 --> 00:42:54,433
-You know what happened to me?
-What?

625
00:42:54,537 --> 00:42:57,335
Last night I met up
with the assassins.

626
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,841
-No! Those villains!
-Those villains of all villains!

627
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:03,577
-And did they get your coins?
-Oh, no!

628
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,673
No, you're right. In fact, here
they are. I've got all four of them!

629
00:43:08,585 --> 00:43:11,110
Are we still in time
for the Field of Miracles?

630
00:43:11,321 --> 00:43:12,788
What Field of Miracles?

631
00:43:12,956 --> 00:43:15,948
-But--
-Of course, the Field of Miracles.

632
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:17,388
Let's go right away.
Which way is it?

633
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:18,825
It's over there!

634
00:43:18,928 --> 00:43:19,917
-Over here?
-Over there!

635
00:43:20,029 --> 00:43:21,018
Over there!

636
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,361
-We're finally here!
-We are?

637
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:29,630
-This is the Field of Miracles!
-It's lovely!

638
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,974
-But what about the trees?
-They've harvested everything.

639
00:43:33,076 --> 00:43:36,341
We're late, hurry up!
Make a hole, come on!

640
00:43:37,747 --> 00:43:38,736
But where?

641
00:43:38,848 --> 00:43:39,837
-Right there!
-Over there!

642
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:41,883
-Over there!
-Over here!

643
00:43:42,585 --> 00:43:46,817
Over here, all right.
Over here, then.

644
00:43:49,592 --> 00:43:51,526
When I get rich...

645
00:43:52,061 --> 00:43:54,723
...not only do I want to buy
a jacket for my father...

646
00:43:55,198 --> 00:43:58,258
...but for the Fairy, too!
I'll buy the Fairy ten jackets...

647
00:43:58,368 --> 00:44:02,771
...since she's the most beautiful
and the kindest fairy I've met!

648
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:04,271
Enough, that's enough!

649
00:44:04,507 --> 00:44:06,600
Put the coins in
and cover up the hole!

650
00:44:06,709 --> 00:44:08,199
All right, here they are!

651
00:44:13,983 --> 00:44:15,575
Do we need to water them?

652
00:44:16,486 --> 00:44:18,647
-When will they start growing?
-ln half an hour.

653
00:44:19,856 --> 00:44:22,416
Take a little stroll.
You see that town over there?

654
00:44:22,692 --> 00:44:25,024
It's the town of Saptrap.

655
00:44:26,029 --> 00:44:29,226
Take a walk, come back
in half an hour, and you'll find--

656
00:44:29,966 --> 00:44:32,059
Clink, clink, clink, clink!

657
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:35,168
-And all for you!
-For you.

658
00:44:35,538 --> 00:44:38,063
Lucky, lucky you, Pinocchio!
Bye!

659
00:44:38,441 --> 00:44:40,841
-Goodbye!
-Goodbye!

660
00:44:45,548 --> 00:44:47,743
Excuse me, Mister Farmer,
has half an hour gone by?

661
00:44:48,484 --> 00:44:50,349
Far too many half hours
have gone by!

662
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:52,447
Mamma mia, I hope I'm not late!

663
00:45:06,669 --> 00:45:09,365
What do you have to laugh about,
Cricket? Hurry up!

664
00:45:10,907 --> 00:45:14,104
-ls it me you're laughing at?
-Yes, I'm laughing at you.

665
00:45:14,277 --> 00:45:18,236
Money doesn't grow in fields,
like beans and pumpkins.

666
00:45:18,648 --> 00:45:21,014
You have to earn it honestly!

667
00:45:22,018 --> 00:45:25,146
The same old lecture!
What do you mean?

668
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:27,553
You should know that
while you were away...

669
00:45:28,124 --> 00:45:31,525
...the Fox and the Cat
took the gold coins...

670
00:45:32,128 --> 00:45:33,857
...and ran off with them.

671
00:45:34,197 --> 00:45:36,495
The Fox and the Cat,
they took--?

672
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,458
Two good people like them!

673
00:45:39,035 --> 00:45:42,129
I can't believe it!
I can't believe it!

674
00:45:43,172 --> 00:45:44,434
That's why I can't find them!

675
00:45:45,041 --> 00:45:46,303
Thieves!

676
00:45:49,345 --> 00:45:52,371
Thieves! I'm going to
report them right now!

677
00:45:52,815 --> 00:45:56,979
There must be a judge in Saptrap!
I'll get the meanest one there is.

678
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,447
I'll give him first and last names.

679
00:45:59,956 --> 00:46:01,082
They're going to
hear from me now!

680
00:46:01,691 --> 00:46:03,625
Poor Pinocchio!

681
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:08,659
One was named Cat and the
other one Fox. A pair of thieves!

682
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,699
And I have a witness,
the Talking Cricket...

683
00:46:10,867 --> 00:46:15,327
...who saw them right when they
took my gold coins and ran off!

684
00:46:15,805 --> 00:46:19,639
A pair of thieves! The tree didn't
even have the chance to grow!

685
00:46:20,476 --> 00:46:22,205
Is that all?

686
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:26,048
Yes! No! I also have a feeling they
stole another one of them from me...

687
00:46:26,149 --> 00:46:27,411
...at the Red Crawfish lnn...

688
00:46:27,517 --> 00:46:31,681
...because I ate a walnut, and they
made me pay a gold coin for it.

689
00:46:31,954 --> 00:46:33,649
Expensive, that walnut of mine!

690
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:42,227
In compliance with Article One
of the Code of Saptrap--

691
00:46:42,865 --> 00:46:46,699
Trap this sap and
take him to prison!

692
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:48,159
Five years!

693
00:46:48,671 --> 00:46:49,797
I'm the one that
they were stolen from!

694
00:46:49,906 --> 00:46:50,895
Come sap!

695
00:46:56,112 --> 00:46:57,374
In you go, sap!

696
00:47:02,552 --> 00:47:04,645
Well, there you have it.
I deserve it!

697
00:47:04,754 --> 00:47:05,743
It serves me right!

698
00:47:06,455 --> 00:47:07,922
The little Cricket told me so...

699
00:47:08,357 --> 00:47:11,258
...but I'm a headstrong
and peevish puppet.

700
00:47:13,262 --> 00:47:16,390
From now on, though,
I resolve to change my life.

701
00:47:17,066 --> 00:47:21,162
I want to become a good boy,
well-behaved, obedient, honest...

702
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:23,238
...and I want to go to school
and work!

703
00:47:23,573 --> 00:47:25,473
-A fine sucker you are!
-Who's that?

704
00:47:29,478 --> 00:47:30,945
They've tamed you,
haven't they, puppet?

705
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:33,907
What's your name?

706
00:47:34,951 --> 00:47:37,920
-My name is Pinocchio.
-How long are you in for?

707
00:47:39,288 --> 00:47:42,519
Five years. How long does it
take for five years to go by?

708
00:47:42,792 --> 00:47:44,157
-lt takes years.
-How many?

709
00:47:45,261 --> 00:47:46,250
Five!

710
00:47:46,796 --> 00:47:48,093
Dear Fairy!

711
00:47:49,131 --> 00:47:52,692
-How long are you in for?
-I get out today. I was just leaving.

712
00:47:53,169 --> 00:47:55,763
This place is all yours. I'll even
leave you my spelling book.

713
00:47:56,272 --> 00:47:57,364
Are you a disobedient boy?

714
00:47:58,507 --> 00:47:59,496
Yes, I am.

715
00:48:00,409 --> 00:48:03,776
No one's going to tame me,
dear Pinocchio.

716
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:08,442
I want to show you something.

717
00:48:17,093 --> 00:48:19,152
The other day,
instead of going to school...

718
00:48:20,263 --> 00:48:21,355
...I ran away from home.

719
00:48:22,932 --> 00:48:24,524
-You know what I did?
-No.

720
00:48:25,067 --> 00:48:26,261
I went into a candy shop...

721
00:48:27,703 --> 00:48:30,501
...and I stole all the lollipops
they had!

722
00:48:32,275 --> 00:48:33,264
-No!
-Yes!

723
00:48:33,743 --> 00:48:37,577
And did you lick all of them?

724
00:48:38,247 --> 00:48:40,511
I was just about to give
the first one a lick...

725
00:48:40,616 --> 00:48:42,777
...when I heard the voice
of a policeman:

726
00:48:42,885 --> 00:48:44,876
"Stop, don't move
your tongue, thief...

727
00:48:45,321 --> 00:48:48,051
...and hand over
the 28 lollipops you stole!"

728
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:50,190
They confiscated them...

729
00:48:50,293 --> 00:48:53,558
...and told me that they had to give
them back to the owner of the shop.

730
00:48:54,163 --> 00:48:55,528
But I think...

731
00:48:55,865 --> 00:48:57,423
...they licked them all themselves!

732
00:49:01,003 --> 00:49:03,938
There is one other thing,
though, the lollipops--

733
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,102
There weren't 28 of them.

734
00:49:07,043 --> 00:49:08,704
There were 29!

735
00:49:12,048 --> 00:49:13,208
Let me see.

736
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:16,318
-You know what flavor this is?
-No!

737
00:49:18,988 --> 00:49:21,923
It's out of this world.
Smell it!

738
00:49:24,493 --> 00:49:27,929
-No!
-Yes! Tangerine!

739
00:49:30,266 --> 00:49:31,494
Listen...

740
00:49:33,502 --> 00:49:36,300
...would you let me take a lick?
Just one?

741
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:39,337
You lick there, and I'll lick
here. Go ahead!

742
00:49:48,417 --> 00:49:49,441
Delicious!

743
00:49:56,325 --> 00:49:57,314
Listen.

744
00:49:59,662 --> 00:50:01,027
When you get back home...

745
00:50:01,964 --> 00:50:02,953
...are your parents...

746
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,561
...delicious, going
to send you to school?

747
00:50:07,703 --> 00:50:09,068
Remember one thing, puppet:

748
00:50:09,939 --> 00:50:12,373
There's only one person who
decides what I have to do.

749
00:50:12,475 --> 00:50:13,533
And that's Lucignolo!

750
00:50:15,411 --> 00:50:18,972
-And who is this Lucignolo?
-I am! Me!

751
00:50:19,815 --> 00:50:20,804
-You?
-Yes!

752
00:50:20,916 --> 00:50:23,510


753
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:28,748
Come on, Lucignolo!

754
00:50:34,597 --> 00:50:37,464
Out you go! You've learned
your lesson, haven't you?

755
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:39,126
Now get yourself to school!

756
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:44,901
Bye, Pinocchio!
See you in five years!

757
00:50:45,207 --> 00:50:46,265
Bye, Lucignolo!

758
00:50:47,243 --> 00:50:48,642
Here, this is for you.

759
00:50:49,211 --> 00:50:51,907
-What is it?
-Your supper. Pear peels.

760
00:51:09,632 --> 00:51:12,726
A, B, C, D, H....

761
00:51:12,835 --> 00:51:13,995
At least I know the first ones.

762
00:51:14,603 --> 00:51:16,468
Now, horse and...

763
00:51:16,572 --> 00:51:18,802
...elee...elee...

764
00:51:19,975 --> 00:51:20,964
...phan....

765
00:51:21,977 --> 00:51:22,966
What's going on?

766
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:32,316
Oh, Father, dear Fairy....

767
00:51:40,196 --> 00:51:42,391
-Come on, come on out!
-What's going on?

768
00:51:42,998 --> 00:51:46,832
Everyone's free! Free!

769
00:51:47,203 --> 00:51:50,661
-So have five years gone by?
-No, four months.

770
00:51:51,006 --> 00:51:54,442
A son's been born to the King of
Saptrap. In sign of jubilation...

771
00:51:54,543 --> 00:51:57,103
...there will be great festivities.
All the criminals are being freed!

772
00:51:57,713 --> 00:51:59,647
Hey, but I'm a criminal, too!

773
00:52:02,485 --> 00:52:05,545
-What did you say?
-I'm a criminal, too.

774
00:52:06,222 --> 00:52:11,285
Oh, well, in that case,
this way, please!

775
00:52:14,663 --> 00:52:17,962
Long live the King!
Long live the King of Saptrap!

776
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:23,502
What I've been through! Who knows
if my father has waited for me?

777
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:25,206
Will I find him
at the Fairy's house?

778
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:28,911
I haven't seen him for so long.
I'm just dying to give him...

779
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:31,071
...a thousand hugs and
finish him off with kisses!

780
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:34,245
Will the Fairy forgive me
for the terrible thing I did to her?

781
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:38,145
Oh, let's hope so!
Let's hope so! Let's hope so.

782
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:02,537
"Here lies the Fairy...."

783
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:11,114
"Here lies the Fairy
with the blue hair...

784
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:14,955
...who died of grief
because of Pinocchio"!

785
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:20,386
Pinocchio! But that's me!

786
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,732
Oh, dear Fairy, dear Fairy!

787
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:26,461
Why did you die?

788
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:30,229
Oh, why didn't I die...

789
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:36,575
...since I'm so bad and you were
so very, very good, dear Fairy?

790
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:42,580
Dear Fairy, what do you
have to do to die?

791
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,050
If you truly love me...

792
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:49,418
...if you love your Pinocchio...

793
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,923
...come back to life,
like you were before...

794
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:58,167
...when I could look at you
because you were alive!

795
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:05,871
Dear Fairy, live again!

796
00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:13,844
Live again, dear Fairy!
Live again!

797
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:18,680
Live again!

798
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:22,449
Live again!

799
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:36,765
DOVE: Tell me, boy,
what are you doing down there?

800
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,064
Don't you see? I'm crying!

801
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,841
Is there a puppet named Pinocchio
among your friends?

802
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:45,174
Did you say Pinocchio?

803
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:49,247
-That's me!
-Then you must know Geppetto.

804
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:52,952
Of course! He's my poor father!
Did he talk to you about me?

805
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:55,057
For goodness' sake, answer me,
where is he?

806
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:58,651
He's been roaming the world
for four months in search of you!

807
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:01,120
Is he far away?
Take me to him, please!

808
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:02,220
Follow me.

809
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:06,996
Thank you, my dear Dove.
I'll get to see my father again!

810
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:10,367
I'll see my father again!
Here I come, Father!

811
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:55,442
What happened?

812
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:59,318
What happened is that because
of his son, who he can't find...

813
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:01,318
...a poor father got
into a little boat...

814
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:03,949
...and went to look for him
on the other side of the sea!

815
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:08,696
But that, but that looks like...

816
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:11,966
...that seems to be--
That is my father!

817
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:18,671
Father, Father, Father, Father!

818
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:21,744
It's me, it's your son!
Father!

819
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:24,674
-Dear Father!
-Pinocchio!

820
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:27,843
He saw me! Here I am, Father!

821
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:30,819
Father!
I'll never leave you again!

822
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:33,479
Come back, dear Father!

823
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:38,816
Father!

824
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:41,085
Father!

825
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:49,662
Father! Father!
I want to save my father!

826
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:30,477
Oh, Father! Father!
And now what?

827
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:34,039
That was a narrow escape,
mamma mia!

828
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:37,683
What kind of place is this?

829
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:40,085
Are there are any towns in this place
with the sea all around it?

830
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:45,588
I want to go see,
just for the heck of it.

831
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:51,097
Dear Fairy, now that I've lost
you and my father...

832
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:53,929
...where will I sleep at night?

833
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:58,269
It would be better, a hundred times
better, if I died, too.

834
00:57:58,374 --> 00:58:00,103
Yes, I want to die!

835
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:02,304
And I'm starving.

836
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:05,273
Excuse me, kind lady.

837
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,811
Would you give me something
to eat if I carry your jug for you?

838
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:14,321
What are you doing here, puppet?

839
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:16,085
If you only knew what
I've been through!

840
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:17,591
I'm fed up with living
the life of a puppet.

841
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:19,889
I want to become
like everyone else!

842
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:22,487
And you will be, if you prove
that you deserve to.

843
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:23,962
Really? How?

844
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:27,527
Respectable boys are obedient,
but you, on the other hand--

845
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:28,934
I never obey.

846
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:31,972
Respectable boys
always tell the truth.

847
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:33,474
And I always tell lies.

848
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:36,272
Respectable boys are happy
to go to school.

849
00:58:36,379 --> 00:58:39,041
And me,
school gives me a bellyache.

850
00:58:39,148 --> 00:58:41,275
School is really, it's really....

851
00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:47,317
Excuse me, kind lady,
but you....

852
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:49,816
How can you know that l--?

853
00:58:56,199 --> 00:59:00,260
But.... But it's you!

854
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:03,865
Oh, dear Fairy, dear Fairy!

855
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:07,807
If you only knew my sorrow
and the lump I felt in my throat...

856
00:59:08,644 --> 00:59:11,010
...when I read "Here lies...."

857
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,716
I know, and that's why
I've forgiven you.

858
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:19,119
The sincerity of your sorrow made me
realize that you have a kind heart...

859
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,652
...and perhaps
there's some hope...

860
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:24,454
...that you'll get back
on the right path.

861
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,494
Oh, yes, yes, dear Fairy.

862
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:30,426
-I want to get back on it!
-Then you'll have to obey me.

863
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:34,833
Oh, yes! I'll study, I'll work,
I'll do everything you tell me to!

864
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:38,532
And I'm telling you that tomorrow
morning you have to go to school...

865
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:41,474
...and you'll go because
you promised me to.

866
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:42,767
Yes, I'll go.

867
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:50,642
Oh, dear Fairy.
The house in the forest....

868
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:01,829
Hey, boys, isn't this cute?

869
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:09,560
It's mine!

870
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:11,196
That hat's mine!

871
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:13,673
It's mine. I found it on
the beach and I get to keep it!

872
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,505
No, I'm the one who lost it.
It's mine!

873
01:00:15,611 --> 01:00:18,774
-Then come and get it!
-My father made it for me.

874
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:25,012
Give me back my hat or
things are going to end badly!

875
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,952
We're really scared!

876
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:28,045
Look how he's dressed!

877
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:31,351
Go to school, puppet,
or you'll be late!

878
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,554
You're telling me to go
to school?

879
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,893
Only one person
decides what I have to do.

880
01:00:35,998 --> 01:00:36,987
And that's Pinocchio!

881
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:39,167
-And who is this Pinocchio?
-I am!

882
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:41,669
Pinocchio!
His name is Pinocchio!

883
01:00:41,904 --> 01:00:44,202
Yes, and I want my hat back!

884
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:49,639
Pinocchio...cuckoo!

885
01:00:50,646 --> 01:00:52,079
Cuckoo to me?

886
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:54,616
I'll beat you all up!

887
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:02,951
A fight! My favorite!
This is the life!

888
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:08,786
My hat! That hat's mine!

889
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:16,638
It's mine, it's mine!

890
01:01:17,139 --> 01:01:18,436
Take this, puppet!

891
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:30,885
Mamma mia, help me.
I don't feel very good.

892
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:35,757
-I'm dying.
-Dying?

893
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:38,790
-What happened to you, Eugenio?
-ls he dead?

894
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:44,931
Eugenio's dead! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's get out of here!

895
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:57,679
Eugenio! It wasn't me!

896
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:00,578
Breathe! Open your eyes,
Eugenio!

897
01:02:01,817 --> 01:02:04,911
Oh, get up, Eugenio! Get up!

898
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:06,045
What did you do to that boy?

899
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:13,925
Me and my classmates
were just playing here...

900
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:15,854
...and at a certain point
he didn't feel very good.

901
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:19,892
This boy has been hit in the head!

902
01:02:20,603 --> 01:02:22,730
-Who hit him?
-Well, not me!

903
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,471
And what was he hit with?

904
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:28,510
-With that book over there.
-And whose book is it?

905
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:32,143
-Mine.
-That's enough! Not another word!

906
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:34,739
- I knew it!
-This boy could die.

907
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:35,839
Eugenio.

908
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:38,648
You, take this poor boy
to the hospital!

909
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:41,522
And you, puppet,
you're coming with us to jail!

910
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:43,415
Put him in chains!

911
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:49,423
Oh, Policemen...

912
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:54,427
...could you please cover me
with your capes? I'm so ashamed!

913
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:56,666
You should have thought
of that before!

914
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:08,676
Nice Policemen, couldn't
we take another road to go to jail?

915
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:11,149
This is the road! Keep walking!

916
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:17,653
Stop! Stop him!

917
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:29,433
This way! This way! Faster!

918
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,315
What a strange-looking marten!

919
01:03:43,786 --> 01:03:46,687
Hey, what are you doing
on my property?

920
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:48,613
You wanted to steal my grapes,
did you?

921
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:53,718
No, I'm a respectable boy!
I was going to school!

922
01:03:54,363 --> 01:03:56,831
You go to school with handcuffs
on? Nice school!

923
01:03:57,533 --> 01:03:59,831
You escaped from jail,
and you're dangerous!

924
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:02,404
I'm leaving that trap on your foot!

925
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:06,266
In fact, I really want to teach
you a nice lesson!

926
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:11,101
Since...

927
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:15,647
...my watchdog has died,
my poor Melampo...

928
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:17,446
...you'll take his place!

929
01:04:18,287 --> 01:04:20,653
But I've never been a watchdog!

930
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:24,359
It's easy! If any thieves
show up, you bark!

931
01:04:24,693 --> 01:04:26,285
-But how?
-Like this. Woof, woof!

932
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:28,386
-Let's go, my pretties!
-Woof, woof!

933
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:32,690
Loud, louder!
Again!

934
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:37,169
I'm so scared! Woof!
It's so dark!

935
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:42,071
But it serves me right.
I'm afraid it serves me right.

936
01:04:42,578 --> 01:04:45,672
If only I could be born again!

937
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:49,575
But it's too late now.
I'll just have to be patient!

938
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,346
Woof, woof, woof, woof!

939
01:05:15,511 --> 01:05:17,308
Thieves! Woof!

940
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:18,812
Shh!

941
01:05:18,914 --> 01:05:21,178
Melampo, it's me!

942
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:24,151
Are you an idiot?
Act like a good dog!

943
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:28,556
I beg your pardon, but I'm not
a dog! I'm a puppet.

944
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,718
A puppet? I don't trust you.

945
01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:34,496
If you're really a puppet,
answer this question:

946
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:38,122
What's the best
lollipop flavor of all?

947
01:05:38,901 --> 01:05:41,301
I know! It's tangerine!

948
01:05:42,237 --> 01:05:44,933
-Why?
-Because-- Why?

949
01:05:48,477 --> 01:05:50,342
Because it's out of this world!

950
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:59,913
Lucignolo! Noble soul!
I'm so glad to see you!

951
01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:01,011
What are you doing here?

952
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:03,151
If you only knew
what I've been through!

953
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:04,652
What are you doing here?

954
01:06:07,997 --> 01:06:09,692
They've got the nicest chickens
in the area.

955
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:13,500
We can trade eight of them
for two rocking horses.

956
01:06:13,602 --> 01:06:14,591
Help me!

957
01:06:14,803 --> 01:06:18,500
All right, no, well, but you
know it's not nice to steal.

958
01:06:18,974 --> 01:06:21,033
Set me free, and then
tomorrow morning...

959
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:23,111
...we can go to school together.
How about it?

960
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:26,213
That's a stupid way to talk,
Pinocchio.

961
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:29,515
They've tamed you, haven't they?
I'll set you free...

962
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:35,515
...but I'm still going to take
the four chickens!

963
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:43,728
I caught you in the act! Now we've
got some scores to settle! Thieves!

964
01:06:43,832 --> 01:06:47,290
-Run! Run!
-Thank you, noble soul!

965
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:23,527
Pinocchio?

966
01:07:26,408 --> 01:07:27,670
Pinocchio?

967
01:07:32,614 --> 01:07:33,638
Yes?

968
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:35,513
Come in, come on in!

969
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:40,120
But it's late. I'd better--
I wouldn't want to bother you.

970
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:43,649
You're not bothering me.
Come in!

971
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:46,186
I'm not bothering you?

972
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:48,756
Well, all right.

973
01:07:53,635 --> 01:07:56,399
So, tell me,
how did school go today?

974
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:00,602
Well, fine.

975
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:04,906
We learned rivers...

976
01:08:07,549 --> 01:08:10,211
...and then numbers, letters.

977
01:08:10,318 --> 01:08:15,449
Almost all of them:
A, B, C, H, L....

978
01:08:16,825 --> 01:08:17,985
I can't remember anymore.

979
01:08:18,827 --> 01:08:21,762
And then the teacher examined me...

980
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:25,800
...and he gave me
a 10 out of 10.

981
01:08:27,636 --> 01:08:28,660
What did he give you?

982
01:08:32,974 --> 01:08:35,340
He gave me a 10....

983
01:08:43,351 --> 01:08:46,787
It's not true!
It's not true! It's not true!

984
01:08:47,622 --> 01:08:51,888
I wanted to go to school, but
after what I've been through...

985
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,361
...and coming back home,
I said to myself:

986
01:08:55,096 --> 01:08:58,156
"How will I be able to present
myself to my dear Fairy now?

987
01:08:58,533 --> 01:09:03,095
What will she say when she
sees me? Will she forgive me?

988
01:09:03,605 --> 01:09:06,199
She'd have to be too good
to forgive me.

989
01:09:06,608 --> 01:09:10,009
Who knows if she's so good
that she'll forgive me?"

990
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:13,039
And then I said, "No!"
Then I said, "Maybe she will...

991
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:15,180
...because she's good
and beautiful."

992
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:17,282
Then I said,
"lf she forgives me...

993
01:09:17,419 --> 01:09:20,786
...that means she's the best fairy
in the whole world!

994
01:09:21,256 --> 01:09:22,883
If she doesn't forgive me,
she's not!"

995
01:09:23,158 --> 01:09:24,250
But in my opinion, she is!

996
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:26,918
So she really
should forgive me!

997
01:09:27,829 --> 01:09:29,922
We'll see when I get home,
who knows?

998
01:09:31,099 --> 01:09:32,999
Because in my life, dear Fairy...

999
01:09:33,468 --> 01:09:35,868
...I've never had a quarter
of an hour of peace.

1000
01:09:36,538 --> 01:09:37,903
Not even a quarter of an hour!

1001
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:41,107
Do you see what happens when
you don't keep your promises?

1002
01:09:41,676 --> 01:09:46,113
Yes! And I deserve a punishment.
I'm afraid I deserve one!

1003
01:09:47,849 --> 01:09:49,908
No one will ever
punish you again.

1004
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:53,753
In fact, now that
you've truly understood...

1005
01:09:53,855 --> 01:09:55,914
...I want to give you the most
wonderful gift there is.

1006
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:58,390
Yes, your wish will come true.

1007
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:01,351
You'll become a boy
like all the others!

1008
01:10:01,863 --> 01:10:02,887
Would you like that?

1009
01:10:03,231 --> 01:10:07,895
Oh, dear Fairy,
more than anything else!

1010
01:10:08,637 --> 01:10:12,038
-Will you become a good boy?
-I've already become a good boy.

1011
01:10:12,207 --> 01:10:15,870
I've learned my lesson.
This time I've learned my lesson!

1012
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:20,778
I believe you, Pinocchio.
I can tell that you mean it!

1013
01:10:30,325 --> 01:10:33,089
Today is a day of celebration
for you, Pinocchio...

1014
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:37,298
...and the Fairy wanted to invite
in her beautiful house of her...

1015
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:42,000
...all of your future classmates
and your teacher, myself.

1016
01:10:44,339 --> 01:10:46,899
Pleased to meet you,
pleased to meet you all!

1017
01:10:48,944 --> 01:10:50,639
By hereby cutting the cake...

1018
01:10:51,179 --> 01:10:55,673
...I confirm Pinocchio's entrance
into the world of good boys.

1019
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:58,611
You can even choose who you
want to sit next to at school.

1020
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,881
All right. At school
I'd like to sit next to--

1021
01:11:00,989 --> 01:11:05,858
-One, and two--
-Wait a minute!

1022
01:11:06,061 --> 01:11:07,619
-What's the matter?
-Lucignolo's not here!

1023
01:11:08,196 --> 01:11:09,663
-Lucignolo?
-Yes!

1024
01:11:10,031 --> 01:11:12,966
Everyone else is here. Lucignolo
is at the bottom of the class...

1025
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:14,057
...and I've already
decided to fail him.

1026
01:11:14,302 --> 01:11:17,294
He's a good-for-nothing.
It's better that he's not here.

1027
01:11:17,505 --> 01:11:19,996
EVERYONE:
Yes, yes, yes!

1028
01:11:20,141 --> 01:11:22,371
-So, one--
-No!

1029
01:11:22,544 --> 01:11:25,411
He's my best friend, and I love him.
He'd like to be here...

1030
01:11:25,513 --> 01:11:26,844
...and I'll find him.

1031
01:11:26,948 --> 01:11:29,542
Pinocchio, start being obedient!

1032
01:11:30,151 --> 01:11:32,142
You're making a mistake,
because Lucignolo--

1033
01:11:32,253 --> 01:11:33,242
Good boy!

1034
01:11:33,755 --> 01:11:35,416
That does you honor.

1035
01:11:36,157 --> 01:11:38,648
It's only right that on the most
important day of your life...

1036
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,660
...you want your best friend
next to you.

1037
01:11:41,296 --> 01:11:43,423
That's a beautiful thing.
Good boy!

1038
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:46,590
Go and come right back.
We'll be waiting for you!

1039
01:11:46,701 --> 01:11:49,169
Bye! I'll be right back.
Wait for me. Bye!

1040
01:11:55,877 --> 01:12:01,110
Lucignolo!
Lucignolo!

1041
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:06,517
What are you doing over there?

1042
01:12:06,621 --> 01:12:08,350
I've been looking for you
for three hours.

1043
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:09,988
Have you heard the great news?

1044
01:12:10,091 --> 01:12:11,786
Do you know about the good luck
I've had?

1045
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:13,386
I'm not going to be a puppet
anymore!

1046
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:16,089
I'll become a boy like you,
like all the others!

1047
01:12:16,197 --> 01:12:18,563
-Much good may it do you!
-What do you mean?

1048
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:20,760
There's a party at my house.

1049
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:23,838
You're the only one who's not there!
Let's go!

1050
01:12:23,938 --> 01:12:25,496
I can't. I'm leaving tonight...

1051
01:12:26,441 --> 01:12:28,841
...and I'm going far, far away.

1052
01:12:29,544 --> 01:12:30,533
Where are you going?

1053
01:12:30,879 --> 01:12:34,815
I'll live in a town that's the most
wonderful town in the world!

1054
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:37,845
And what's it called?

1055
01:12:38,119 --> 01:12:40,781
It's called Playland.

1056
01:12:42,757 --> 01:12:45,590
What a nice name! Playland?

1057
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:46,991
Why don't you come, too?
Let's go!

1058
01:12:48,163 --> 01:12:51,155
No, I'm staying here
with my Fairy.

1059
01:12:52,233 --> 01:12:54,724
Poor sucker,
you're making a big mistake!

1060
01:12:55,403 --> 01:12:58,395
I'm not making any mistake at all.
What kind of town is it?

1061
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,673
I'll tell you just two things.

1062
01:13:03,378 --> 01:13:06,074
No one ever asks you to work
in that town...

1063
01:13:06,848 --> 01:13:08,406
...there are no teachers, no books...

1064
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:11,084
...and you don't have to go
to school on Sunday.

1065
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:14,479
What a lovely town!

1066
01:13:15,857 --> 01:13:18,417
But you don't have to go to
school on Sundays here, either!

1067
01:13:18,927 --> 01:13:22,658
Yes, but in that town every week
is made up of seven Sundays!

1068
01:13:23,465 --> 01:13:26,229
And just imagine, vacation
starts on the first day of January...

1069
01:13:26,701 --> 01:13:28,328
...and ends on the last day
of December...

1070
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:31,463
-...that falls on a Sunday!
-Exactly!

1071
01:13:31,806 --> 01:13:34,240
And how do you spend your days
in Playland?

1072
01:13:34,876 --> 01:13:37,743
Playing and doing whatever you
feel like from morning till night.

1073
01:13:38,379 --> 01:13:39,937
What do you think?
Are you coming? Yes or no?

1074
01:13:40,148 --> 01:13:44,084
No! I promised the Fairy
I'd be right back!

1075
01:13:44,285 --> 01:13:46,219
Have a good trip, Lucignolo!

1076
01:13:47,455 --> 01:13:48,513
Bye, puppet!

1077
01:13:49,124 --> 01:13:52,287
Just imagine, a place where
there are no schools.

1078
01:13:57,165 --> 01:13:58,723
One last, one last thing.

1079
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:02,399
Well, do you know for sure,
really for sure...

1080
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:05,132
...that vacation starts
on the first day of January...

1081
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:08,835
...and ends on the very
last day of December?

1082
01:14:08,943 --> 01:14:10,535
Do you know that for sure?

1083
01:14:10,645 --> 01:14:11,737
For extra-sure!

1084
01:14:22,023 --> 01:14:23,081
He'll be back!

1085
01:14:23,291 --> 01:14:26,385
I'm going, I'm leaving,
Lucignolo.

1086
01:14:26,494 --> 01:14:27,927
Bye, farewell, this time for real.

1087
01:14:30,965 --> 01:14:32,626
All right. Bye, Pinocchio.

1088
01:14:42,577 --> 01:14:44,670
-Here it is!
-What?

1089
01:14:45,947 --> 01:14:47,608
The wagon that's come to get me!

1090
01:14:48,449 --> 01:14:50,474
It's wonderful, wonderful!

1091
01:14:52,887 --> 01:14:56,880
So, Lucignolo, I'll stay
for another two minutes.

1092
01:14:57,492 --> 01:14:59,323
Then I'm leaving.

1093
01:15:01,396 --> 01:15:02,693
Good evening, my little dear.

1094
01:15:03,464 --> 01:15:05,398
Unfortunately,
the wagon is full!

1095
01:15:09,771 --> 01:15:12,103
If it's full inside,
I'll sit out here!

1096
01:15:17,412 --> 01:15:20,347
And you, my love,
what do you intend to do?

1097
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:21,975
Are you coming with us
or staying?

1098
01:15:54,916 --> 01:15:56,042
What did I tell you?

1099
01:15:56,451 --> 01:15:58,681
It's paradise!

1100
01:16:00,388 --> 01:16:02,515
-Bye, Pinocchio!
-Bye, Lucignolo!

1101
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:12,330
Pinocchio! Pinocchio!

1102
01:16:25,346 --> 01:16:28,679
Mamma mia, it's an inferno!

1103
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:31,585
I've got to find him right away,
or it'll be too late.

1104
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:34,779
Pinocchio, Pinocchio!

1105
01:16:35,623 --> 01:16:41,323
Dearest friends, here I am!
I'm up here! Friends!

1106
01:16:44,198 --> 01:16:47,759
Help! Help! Help!

1107
01:16:48,436 --> 01:16:52,236
Where are you, Pinocchio?
I've got to look for him.

1108
01:16:52,707 --> 01:16:53,969
Stop it!

1109
01:16:54,976 --> 01:16:56,841
A little peace and quiet.

1110
01:17:06,921 --> 01:17:09,788
Get out of here!
You'll all become jackasses.

1111
01:17:10,491 --> 01:17:13,153
Pinocchio! Where are you?

1112
01:17:16,531 --> 01:17:17,759
Saint Anthony!

1113
01:17:20,234 --> 01:17:21,599
Sacred deities!
I'll never find him!

1114
01:17:21,936 --> 01:17:24,871
And you, get out of this place!
How can I make you understand?

1115
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:27,999
Leave! You'll all become asses!

1116
01:17:29,043 --> 01:17:30,806
Help! I can't breathe!
I'm suffocating!

1117
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:33,346
I can't stand it!
Get me out of here!

1118
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:44,351
Help! Help! Help!

1119
01:17:51,165 --> 01:17:52,257
Saint Anthony!

1120
01:17:58,039 --> 01:17:59,301
I can't take it anymore!

1121
01:18:01,576 --> 01:18:02,565
Oh, mamma!

1122
01:18:05,713 --> 01:18:07,078
It's an inferno!

1123
01:18:12,553 --> 01:18:15,113
Lucignolo! Everyone
is asleep already?

1124
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:17,248
Where shall we go?
What shall we do?

1125
01:18:17,358 --> 01:18:20,020
-It's time to go to sleep now!
-No, not to sleep!

1126
01:18:20,127 --> 01:18:23,028
Come on, I feel like doing
all sort of things!

1127
01:18:23,130 --> 01:18:25,496
I know, but just
two or three hours...

1128
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:28,168
...then tomorrow morning
we can start all over again!

1129
01:18:28,269 --> 01:18:29,896
I can't wait to start all over again!

1130
01:18:30,004 --> 01:18:31,403
-You like it here.
-Yes.

1131
01:18:31,505 --> 01:18:33,063
And to think that you didn't
want to come along.

1132
01:18:33,174 --> 01:18:34,607
It's true, Lucignolo.

1133
01:18:35,009 --> 01:18:39,309
If I'm a truly happy boy today,
it's all thanks to you!

1134
01:18:39,547 --> 01:18:42,209
You don't need to thank me.
I did it with all my heart!

1135
01:18:44,518 --> 01:18:45,542
Noble soul!

1136
01:18:47,822 --> 01:18:54,421
Lucignolo, the teacher
wanted to fail you.

1137
01:18:54,528 --> 01:18:57,861
At my house, he said,
"I'm going to fail that one."

1138
01:18:58,833 --> 01:19:02,064
I know, but I forgive him.

1139
01:19:05,006 --> 01:19:06,701
Noble soul!

1140
01:19:07,842 --> 01:19:09,537
Good night, my friend!

1141
01:19:10,044 --> 01:19:11,409
Good night, my friend!

1142
01:19:25,893 --> 01:19:27,520
Thank goodness it's all over!

1143
01:19:29,363 --> 01:19:30,489
They're turning into jackasses.

1144
01:19:30,598 --> 01:19:31,963
You'll have to pay good money
for them...

1145
01:19:32,633 --> 01:19:36,729
...because they're all tender
young things, nice and fresh!

1146
01:19:37,638 --> 01:19:39,162
-That one's all set to go!
-I'll buy it!

1147
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,331
-How many do you want this year?
-About 50. I want hard workers.

1148
01:19:42,677 --> 01:19:44,474
And make sure they
can take a beating!

1149
01:19:44,578 --> 01:19:46,136
They can, they can!

1150
01:19:46,247 --> 01:19:47,305
That's a nice one!

1151
01:19:47,682 --> 01:19:50,173
It certainly is.
How many do you want?

1152
01:19:50,318 --> 01:19:53,310
I want about 50, too.
When can we take them?

1153
01:19:54,155 --> 01:19:55,144
In a matter of minutes.

1154
01:19:56,757 --> 01:20:00,591
-Would there happen to be one?
-Of course there is!

1155
01:20:01,162 --> 01:20:02,595
We've got them in all shapes
and sizes.

1156
01:20:03,864 --> 01:20:05,764
All the boys turn
into jackasses here.

1157
01:20:05,866 --> 01:20:10,462
First the ears, then the tail,
then "hee-haw," just like that!

1158
01:20:11,172 --> 01:20:12,434
I'll take a hundred of them!

1159
01:20:12,573 --> 01:20:15,406
Look at this one, just look
at this pretty little muzzle!

1160
01:20:20,781 --> 01:20:23,113
What did you think you'd become?

1161
01:20:23,584 --> 01:20:24,642
Doctors?

1162
01:20:25,119 --> 01:20:26,711
Professors?

1163
01:20:27,655 --> 01:20:31,751
You're all jackasses!
All jackasses!

1164
01:20:39,166 --> 01:20:41,566
It's already morning!
I can't wait to start all over again!

1165
01:20:41,836 --> 01:20:45,465
It's great being here!
Let's go, Lucignolo, let's go!

1166
01:21:31,786 --> 01:21:33,947
But these are....
They are....

1167
01:21:34,588 --> 01:21:38,251
These are two genuine ass's ears.
And they're all hairy!

1168
01:21:38,959 --> 01:21:39,983
Just look!

1169
01:21:41,295 --> 01:21:44,492
I don't want them!
I don't want them!

1170
01:21:44,965 --> 01:21:47,991
What shall I do now?
I'm ashamed to go out like this!

1171
01:21:48,969 --> 01:21:50,869
This must be one
of Lucignolo's tricks!

1172
01:21:51,572 --> 01:21:53,233
It's all his fault, yes!

1173
01:21:56,210 --> 01:21:59,236
I'm going to see him right now.
I'll give him a piece of my mind!

1174
01:22:00,648 --> 01:22:02,138
Lucignolo, it's me, Pinocchio!

1175
01:22:03,284 --> 01:22:05,115
Come in, come on in!

1176
01:22:08,222 --> 01:22:09,655
Good morning, Lucignolo.
How are you?

1177
01:22:10,591 --> 01:22:11,580
Fine!

1178
01:22:22,937 --> 01:22:26,896
So, Lucignolo, how come you're
wearing that cloth on your head?

1179
01:22:28,042 --> 01:22:29,532
The doctor ordered me to...

1180
01:22:29,643 --> 01:22:33,340
...because my knee hurts!

1181
01:22:34,081 --> 01:22:35,912
Poor Lucignolo!

1182
01:22:38,152 --> 01:22:39,449
How about you?

1183
01:22:39,553 --> 01:22:43,956
Me? Well, I hurt my elbow...

1184
01:22:44,058 --> 01:22:46,424
...and so the same doctor
told me....

1185
01:22:47,261 --> 01:22:51,322
-Poor Pinocchio!
-Yes, I know. It's unfortunate.

1186
01:22:51,966 --> 01:22:54,298
Lucignolo, would you do
me a favor, please?

1187
01:22:54,735 --> 01:22:58,227
-Gladly! With all my heart.
-Would you show me your ears?

1188
01:23:00,374 --> 01:23:04,276
Gladly! But first I want to see
yours, dear Pinocchio!

1189
01:23:05,412 --> 01:23:09,473
No, then let's do this.
I'll count to--

1190
01:23:10,084 --> 01:23:11,813
-Do you know how to count?
-Of course!

1191
01:23:12,119 --> 01:23:13,279
Then you count to three...

1192
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:15,911
...and on three all three of us
will take them off.

1193
01:23:17,024 --> 01:23:18,048
All right!

1194
01:23:19,894 --> 01:23:22,328
One, and three!

1195
01:23:30,271 --> 01:23:31,829
What ears you've got, Lucignolo!

1196
01:23:40,247 --> 01:23:41,680
Just look at the ears you've got!

1197
01:23:49,924 --> 01:23:51,050
There's....

1198
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:54,484
You've got something....

1199
01:23:57,431 --> 01:23:58,420
Lucignolo!

1200
01:24:01,635 --> 01:24:05,435
What's this here?
Oh, mamma mia!

1201
01:24:05,639 --> 01:24:08,107
It's a tail!
You've sprouted a tail!

1202
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:11,171
-Do I have one, too?
-No, not yet.

1203
01:24:12,012 --> 01:24:13,912
What does that mean?
That I'll get one, too?

1204
01:24:14,014 --> 01:24:15,003
I don't know...

1205
01:24:15,849 --> 01:24:18,044
-...but I'm scared.
-It's disgusting!

1206
01:24:20,287 --> 01:24:26,123
What's happening to me?
What's happening to me?

1207
01:24:26,627 --> 01:24:29,061
Pinocchio, help me!
Help me, Pinocchio!

1208
01:24:29,496 --> 01:24:30,793
Lucignolo, Lucignolo!

1209
01:24:33,434 --> 01:24:37,200
Pinocchio! Pinocchio!

1210
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:39,228
-You're here?
-Lucignolo.

1211
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:40,773
Lucignolo, you've turned
into a donkey!

1212
01:24:41,575 --> 01:24:42,906
Help me, I've got a tail!

1213
01:24:43,210 --> 01:24:45,041
Dear Fairy, help!
I've got a tail.

1214
01:24:45,713 --> 01:24:47,112
CRlCKET:
You deserve it, Pinocchio!

1215
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:52,447
Dear Cricket, thank goodness
you are here, Cricket.

1216
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:54,783
If I had listened
to my good Fairy...

1217
01:24:55,422 --> 01:24:57,617
...I would have become
a respectable boy by now.

1218
01:24:58,192 --> 01:24:59,887
But from now on, I promise you--

1219
01:25:00,561 --> 01:25:02,961
What is there to promise at this
point? It's too late!

1220
01:25:04,098 --> 01:25:07,090
You missed your chance to become
a boy like all the others!

1221
01:25:08,969 --> 01:25:12,735
-What's going to happen to me?
-You'll become a donkey...

1222
01:25:13,841 --> 01:25:15,001
...Iike your friend here...

1223
01:25:15,976 --> 01:25:17,705
...good for pulling a cart!

1224
01:25:19,313 --> 01:25:20,302
No.

1225
01:25:20,414 --> 01:25:21,881
There's no use crying now.

1226
01:25:23,217 --> 01:25:25,447
-Farewell, Pinocchio!
-Lucignolo!

1227
01:25:26,220 --> 01:25:28,814
No, don't leave, dear Cricket!

1228
01:25:29,323 --> 01:25:33,054
I promise you I'll work, I'll study.
I'll do everything.

1229
01:25:33,927 --> 01:25:36,122
Don't leave!

1230
01:25:38,732 --> 01:25:41,792
Lucignolo, was that me?
Was that "mee-haw"?

1231
01:25:45,606 --> 01:25:48,837
Now, my respectable auditors,
ladies and gentlemen...

1232
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:51,938
...the humble undersigned has
the pleasure of presenting...

1233
01:25:52,046 --> 01:25:55,641
...to this substantial public the
most celebrated donkey in the world.

1234
01:25:56,250 --> 01:25:59,083
Pinocchio, the Little Donkey!

1235
01:26:01,655 --> 01:26:03,452
I beg you to observe...

1236
01:26:03,591 --> 01:26:07,220
...the wild game transuding
from this mammal.

1237
01:26:08,329 --> 01:26:09,762
Admire him!

1238
01:26:11,098 --> 01:26:13,191
And then judge him!

1239
01:26:19,907 --> 01:26:24,537
That's a good fellow, Pinocchio,
play dead! And that's not all!

1240
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:29,615
I've also given this animal
of a beast a training in dance...

1241
01:26:30,150 --> 01:26:32,015
...not to mention
the other relative forms...

1242
01:26:32,119 --> 01:26:33,677
...of jumping through
flaming hoops...

1243
01:26:34,288 --> 01:26:35,846
...and over velvet-covered poles!

1244
01:26:36,357 --> 01:26:38,621
Oh, my dear Fairy!

1245
01:26:43,731 --> 01:26:48,361
You don't bray in the face
of the audience, jackass!

1246
01:26:48,469 --> 01:26:49,629
I beg your pardon.

1247
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:54,469
I promise that tomorrow I'll learn
some grammar and etiquette...

1248
01:26:54,909 --> 01:26:59,005
...to this hairy hoofed mammal!

1249
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:01,481
Come on, Pinocchio, chin up!

1250
01:27:02,683 --> 01:27:04,241
Let this crowded crowd see...

1251
01:27:04,351 --> 01:27:09,152
...how I've learned you to jump
with the whip! Chin up, Pinocchio!

1252
01:27:09,924 --> 01:27:11,915
Go, Pinocchio, go!

1253
01:27:28,676 --> 01:27:34,706
Great fall, Pinocchio, a great fall!

1254
01:27:34,915 --> 01:27:39,614
What are you doing, jackass?
On your feet! What's the matter?

1255
01:27:40,054 --> 01:27:41,817
Music, maestro.

1256
01:27:41,922 --> 01:27:44,948
Hurry up, bring in the clowns!

1257
01:27:45,059 --> 01:27:47,050
Pinocchio, the Little Donkey!

1258
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:51,895
He broke his leg. Throw
him into the sea! Drown him!

1259
01:27:52,766 --> 01:27:54,631
Pinocchio, the Little Donkey!

1260
01:27:58,072 --> 01:28:01,371
A round of applause!

1261
01:28:34,975 --> 01:28:36,840
Dear Fairy, dear Fairy!

1262
01:28:37,578 --> 01:28:39,842
You're the one who saved me!

1263
01:28:39,947 --> 01:28:44,646
I knew it! I knew it!

1264
01:28:45,252 --> 01:28:47,379
If you only knew what
I've been through!

1265
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:50,480
But I promise you, dear Fairy,
that from now on...

1266
01:28:50,924 --> 01:28:52,687
...I'll be a good boy,
and an honest one!

1267
01:28:53,293 --> 01:28:55,523
Quick, Pinocchio, hurry up,
swim faster!

1268
01:28:55,929 --> 01:28:58,261
I'll go to work, I promise.
I can't swim any faster than this!

1269
01:28:58,365 --> 01:29:01,766
Come on, hurry up! Faster!
Come on, faster!

1270
01:29:02,836 --> 01:29:05,134
Then you love me, too,
dear Fairy?

1271
01:29:06,906 --> 01:29:09,807
When I'm with you,
nothing can happen to me!

1272
01:29:10,109 --> 01:29:11,474
Pinocchio! Watch out!

1273
01:29:11,578 --> 01:29:13,170
What?

1274
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:16,712
What? What's this? Dear Fairy!

1275
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:35,326
Oh, dear Fairy, help!

1276
01:29:35,869 --> 01:29:38,064
I've been eaten!

1277
01:29:38,571 --> 01:29:39,629
A monster fish!

1278
01:29:40,607 --> 01:29:42,234
Let's hope he won't be able
to digest me.

1279
01:29:42,742 --> 01:29:46,303
It's not fair. Right when I was about
to embrace my dear Fairy again!

1280
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:48,169
Who's there?

1281
01:29:52,585 --> 01:29:55,486
I'm so scared. It's probably
full of monster fish in here.

1282
01:30:00,093 --> 01:30:01,082
What kind of place is this?

1283
01:30:01,961 --> 01:30:04,054
-Who's there?
-Who can that be?

1284
01:30:04,163 --> 01:30:06,324
MAN: Who is that?
-I'm so scared!

1285
01:30:06,432 --> 01:30:11,870
MAN: Is someone there?
-I'm a tuna fish!

1286
01:30:11,971 --> 01:30:14,132
And you, what kind of fish
are you?

1287
01:30:15,408 --> 01:30:18,866
I'm not a fish.
I'm a poor old man.

1288
01:30:20,079 --> 01:30:21,171
My name is Geppetto.

1289
01:30:22,215 --> 01:30:23,978
Geppetto! My father!

1290
01:30:24,083 --> 01:30:25,277
I'm here because of my son...

1291
01:30:25,852 --> 01:30:28,946
...who I never want to see again
because he's a bad boy.

1292
01:30:29,756 --> 01:30:30,882
And if I had him right here...

1293
01:30:31,324 --> 01:30:32,848
...I'd beat the living daylights
out of him...

1294
01:30:33,226 --> 01:30:35,626
...with my own hands! Bad boy!

1295
01:30:36,129 --> 01:30:41,931
Oh, yes? Was this son of yours
really so bad?

1296
01:30:42,268 --> 01:30:45,601
I put so much loving care into
making him into a good boy!

1297
01:30:46,706 --> 01:30:50,142
I went to jail for him,
you know, Mister Tuna.

1298
01:30:51,377 --> 01:30:54,039
-He's a bad boy.
-It's not true.

1299
01:30:54,147 --> 01:30:56,877
An ingrate, a liar,
and he has no heart.

1300
01:30:57,750 --> 01:30:58,842
No heart at all.

1301
01:30:59,786 --> 01:31:01,481
While I'm in here suffering...

1302
01:31:01,587 --> 01:31:04,249
...he's probably
running around somewhere...

1303
01:31:04,357 --> 01:31:07,326
-Father, I want my Father!
-...having a good time!

1304
01:31:08,394 --> 01:31:09,884
Do you understand Mister Tuna...

1305
01:31:10,196 --> 01:31:11,527
...what a bad boy I have?

1306
01:31:17,236 --> 01:31:18,260
But Mister Tuna...

1307
01:31:21,374 --> 01:31:22,500
...you're crying!

1308
01:31:24,277 --> 01:31:28,213
We tuna fish cry very easily!

1309
01:31:30,183 --> 01:31:33,983
But in any case, it's all over
for me now, Mister Tuna.

1310
01:31:35,321 --> 01:31:38,381
I'll never see my son again.

1311
01:31:41,894 --> 01:31:46,558
But if you saw him now,
what would you do?

1312
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:48,758
What do you think I would do?

1313
01:31:49,335 --> 01:31:51,963
I'm a father, he's my son...

1314
01:31:53,006 --> 01:31:57,534
...and, in spite of everything,
I love him. If I had him here now...

1315
01:31:59,445 --> 01:32:01,310
...I'd hug him as hard as I could...

1316
01:32:01,881 --> 01:32:05,715
...I'd kiss him,
and I'd die of happiness.

1317
01:32:06,652 --> 01:32:07,778
But never mind!

1318
01:32:13,726 --> 01:32:14,715
Father!

1319
01:32:15,094 --> 01:32:18,120
-Pinocchio, my son!
-I'm not a tuna fish!

1320
01:32:18,798 --> 01:32:21,699
It's me, Pinocchio the puppet...

1321
01:32:22,168 --> 01:32:24,398
...your one and only son!

1322
01:32:24,937 --> 01:32:27,804
Pinocchio, Pinocchio my son!

1323
01:32:47,493 --> 01:32:49,893
-I don't know how to swim!
-I'll help you, Father.

1324
01:32:49,996 --> 01:32:51,987
-Save yourself.
-I'm not going without you...

1325
01:32:52,098 --> 01:32:53,656
...without my father.

1326
01:32:53,866 --> 01:32:56,801
Oh, look, Father!

1327
01:32:59,739 --> 01:33:01,570
-Look!
-I'm not coming, I'm afraid!

1328
01:33:01,741 --> 01:33:04,369
He's getting ready for the sneeze
that'll send us all the way home.

1329
01:33:04,677 --> 01:33:06,008
Father, let's go.

1330
01:33:06,112 --> 01:33:10,173
I'm not coming! I'm afraid!
Give me back my wig!

1331
01:33:11,017 --> 01:33:13,577
-Come and get it!
-You're the same old Pinocchio!

1332
01:33:21,494 --> 01:33:23,587
-Father, where are you?
-My wig!

1333
01:33:23,696 --> 01:33:26,824
-I've got your wig!
-Give me back my wig!

1334
01:33:26,933 --> 01:33:28,992
Lean on me,
and I'll take you home.

1335
01:33:33,473 --> 01:33:38,069
I need a glass of milk so badly
that I'll die if I don't get one.

1336
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:42,671
There's a farmer nearby.

1337
01:33:43,549 --> 01:33:46,677
His name is Giangio,
and he has a nice cow.

1338
01:33:48,087 --> 01:33:50,715
Go see if he'll let
you sweat a little...

1339
01:33:51,290 --> 01:33:53,952
...in exchange for some milk
for me.

1340
01:33:54,060 --> 01:33:55,254
Giangio? All right.

1341
01:33:55,461 --> 01:34:00,125
I'll put you to bed. Then I'll go
to this farmer to get some work.

1342
01:34:02,068 --> 01:34:03,501
But you don't know
how to do anything!

1343
01:34:42,842 --> 01:34:44,139
Good boy, Pinocchio.

1344
01:34:44,243 --> 01:34:46,677
I worked an extra
two hours today...

1345
01:34:46,779 --> 01:34:50,010
...and so Mister Giangio
gave me a penny, too.

1346
01:34:50,649 --> 01:34:54,551
And with that penny,
I bought myself this lollipop!

1347
01:34:55,287 --> 01:34:56,276
A lollipop?

1348
01:34:58,391 --> 01:35:00,825
Yes, but it's for supper!
For supper.

1349
01:35:02,194 --> 01:35:03,388
And besides,
it's not all for tonight.

1350
01:35:03,896 --> 01:35:06,421
Half tonight and half
for supper tomorrow night!

1351
01:35:06,532 --> 01:35:07,521
Good boy!

1352
01:35:07,666 --> 01:35:09,395
Tonight I'll give it three
licks on this side...

1353
01:35:09,869 --> 01:35:11,894
...and tomorrow night
three licks on that side.

1354
01:35:12,004 --> 01:35:13,096
-May l?
-Yes!

1355
01:35:13,205 --> 01:35:14,194
One...

1356
01:35:14,573 --> 01:35:15,562
...and two...

1357
01:35:16,042 --> 01:35:17,669
...and three.

1358
01:35:20,112 --> 01:35:21,739
Three...delicious!

1359
01:35:22,415 --> 01:35:26,647
Look what I've got here, the nicest
carrots and eggplants in the market!

1360
01:35:27,286 --> 01:35:29,652
Good boy, Pinocchio!
Just two more hours--

1361
01:35:30,222 --> 01:35:34,352
No, Mister Farmer Giangio,
I want to keep going until tonight.

1362
01:35:35,027 --> 01:35:37,052
I want to earn
an extra glass of milk.

1363
01:35:37,496 --> 01:35:39,088
My father is expecting just one.

1364
01:35:39,198 --> 01:35:41,462
If I bring him two,
I'll give him a big surprise!

1365
01:35:41,867 --> 01:35:46,167
Good boy, you're a real worker.
Even my donkey can't push like that!

1366
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:48,470
What?
You mean you have a donkey?

1367
01:35:49,408 --> 01:35:53,071
Yes, but he's sick.
I worked him too hard...

1368
01:35:53,546 --> 01:35:55,673
...and now he's at the end
of his life.

1369
01:35:56,749 --> 01:36:01,152
Just taste these carrots,
sweet as cake! Bye, Pinocchio!

1370
01:36:01,754 --> 01:36:04,723
Let's go, Cenerina, let's go!
Come on!

1371
01:36:13,599 --> 01:36:15,294
You'd drink another one,
wouldn't you?

1372
01:36:16,102 --> 01:36:17,933
Of course I'd drink another one...

1373
01:36:18,571 --> 01:36:20,835
...but I'm afraid I'll have to
wait until tomorrow.

1374
01:36:23,776 --> 01:36:24,800
Father?

1375
01:36:29,215 --> 01:36:30,341
Pinocchio!

1376
01:37:31,477 --> 01:37:32,466
What a pretty donkey!

1377
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:37,477
How're you doing?
Well, my pretty one?

1378
01:37:37,950 --> 01:37:40,248
You're not feeling well,
little donkey?

1379
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:41,910
Come on, cheer up!

1380
01:37:42,521 --> 01:37:46,116
I'm sorry you're not feeling well,
little donkey. You're very pretty.

1381
01:37:48,194 --> 01:37:52,631
But, little donkey, but....

1382
01:37:55,267 --> 01:37:59,260
You know....
Actually....

1383
01:38:00,673 --> 01:38:02,004
I think...

1384
01:38:03,108 --> 01:38:04,735
...I've seen you before!

1385
01:38:06,879 --> 01:38:07,868
Pinocchio!

1386
01:38:12,218 --> 01:38:13,549
Noble soul!

1387
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:17,016
Noble soul!
It's you!

1388
01:38:21,227 --> 01:38:22,216
It's you!

1389
01:38:23,762 --> 01:38:28,563
Cheer up, Lucignolo, cheer up!
Come on, Lucignolo!

1390
01:38:29,335 --> 01:38:31,098
Look who's here, Lucignolo!

1391
01:38:34,206 --> 01:38:36,674
I'm so glad to see you again!

1392
01:38:37,509 --> 01:38:40,205
Lucignolo, you're not well.

1393
01:38:43,382 --> 01:38:46,510
Come on, look, Lucignolo!

1394
01:38:49,154 --> 01:38:50,143
Look what I've got!

1395
01:38:51,757 --> 01:38:52,746
It's tangerine.

1396
01:38:54,593 --> 01:38:59,997
It's tangerine, Lucignolo, come on!

1397
01:39:04,370 --> 01:39:07,066
Out of this world!

1398
01:39:08,173 --> 01:39:11,301
Come on, have some more.

1399
01:39:21,253 --> 01:39:25,246
It's tangerine, Lucignolo!
Tangerine! Come on!

1400
01:39:39,305 --> 01:39:40,294
Is he dead?

1401
01:39:43,208 --> 01:39:45,005
You're so moved by an ass?

1402
01:39:45,911 --> 01:39:49,369
Well, I'll tell you,
he was a friend of mine.

1403
01:39:50,516 --> 01:39:53,383
-He was a classmate of mine!
-Nice school!

1404
01:39:54,353 --> 01:39:57,584
-You had a jackass for a classmate!
-Yes.

1405
01:39:57,723 --> 01:39:59,588
I can just imagine the wonderful
studies you've done.

1406
01:40:00,426 --> 01:40:01,723
Get back to work, go on!

1407
01:40:02,127 --> 01:40:03,116
All right!

1408
01:40:11,103 --> 01:40:15,130
Good boy, good boy, I'm starting
to feel a lot better now, you know?

1409
01:40:16,008 --> 01:40:19,034
How about you? Why don't you
sleep for a couple of hours?

1410
01:40:19,145 --> 01:40:20,407
You look tired, son!

1411
01:40:21,580 --> 01:40:23,741
Who, me, Father? No, no, no.

1412
01:40:25,551 --> 01:40:28,918
I'm a strong puppet.
You built me well, Father!

1413
01:40:29,855 --> 01:40:33,552
I'll get some sleep later. Now I need
to make some wicker baskets...

1414
01:40:33,659 --> 01:40:36,253
...so I can sell them
and get some money...

1415
01:40:36,362 --> 01:40:39,798
...and buy you a brand-new jacket!
How about it, Father?

1416
01:40:39,899 --> 01:40:41,526
Thank you.
Good boy.

1417
01:40:42,034 --> 01:40:45,663
Yes, I really do need
a nice new little jacket!

1418
01:40:46,238 --> 01:40:49,696
If you can find it,
get one with black stripes.

1419
01:40:50,209 --> 01:40:52,006
Yes, I like black stripes.

1420
01:40:54,547 --> 01:40:57,380
-What are you doing, Pinocchio?
-What?

1421
01:40:57,483 --> 01:41:00,941
Are you falling asleep? Don't you
have to make the wicker baskets?

1422
01:41:01,053 --> 01:41:02,918
What? Yes, I'm going right now!

1423
01:41:03,556 --> 01:41:07,925
I'll do it outside so I won't bother you.
All right, Father? I'm going....

1424
01:41:09,862 --> 01:41:12,626
The milk, you drank it all up,
didn't you?

1425
01:41:12,732 --> 01:41:15,530
All of it!
- Good job, great! Bye.

1426
01:41:15,634 --> 01:41:16,623
Bye!

1427
01:41:20,906 --> 01:41:23,875
Good boy!
Good boy!

1428
01:41:53,839 --> 01:41:54,828
Oh, dear Fairy!

1429
01:42:04,216 --> 01:42:05,205
Dear Fairy!

1430
01:42:12,858 --> 01:42:14,052
Good boy, Pinocchio!

1431
01:42:15,094 --> 01:42:19,861
Thanks to your good heart, you
deserve much praise and much joy.

1432
01:42:20,733 --> 01:42:21,961
You did it!

1433
01:42:23,369 --> 01:42:25,769
Dear Fairy, you've taught
me so many things!

1434
01:42:26,272 --> 01:42:28,103
I'll never forget them!
Never!

1435
01:42:28,774 --> 01:42:32,073
Stay on this same path, and
in the future you'll be happy.

1436
01:42:36,182 --> 01:42:37,376
Bye, Pinocchio!

1437
01:42:37,950 --> 01:42:38,939
Bye, dear Fairy!

1438
01:42:39,652 --> 01:42:40,812
Bye!

1439
01:42:41,654 --> 01:42:43,588
Goodbye, Mister Pinocchio!

1440
01:42:43,689 --> 01:42:45,680
Bye, Medoro, goodbye!

1441
01:42:46,158 --> 01:42:47,853
Bye, you rascal of a boy!

1442
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:50,485
Dear Cricket, you're here too?
You're leaving?

1443
01:42:50,996 --> 01:42:53,123
Yes, but if you like,
I can stay!

1444
01:42:53,599 --> 01:42:56,090
No, no, no!
I mean, I was just asking.

1445
01:42:56,302 --> 01:42:59,066
I imagine you must have
so many things to do. Bye.

1446
01:42:59,305 --> 01:43:01,671
Bye, Pinocchio, bye!
- Let's go, little mice!

1447
01:43:19,225 --> 01:43:21,352
Here we go again, Medoro!

1448
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:24,160
This is the last time
I'm doing this for you.

1449
01:43:24,663 --> 01:43:27,564
Tomorrow you're coming with me
to buy some glasses!

1450
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:43,612
He was a fine puppet, though!

1451
01:43:53,525 --> 01:43:56,756
Father!
Father!

1452
01:44:01,533 --> 01:44:02,522
You see this?

1453
01:44:03,736 --> 01:44:05,328
Take a look!
- What is it?

1454
01:44:05,437 --> 01:44:07,997
Touch it, pull it.
Go ahead and pull! Pull!

1455
01:44:09,341 --> 01:44:10,330
It's real!

1456
01:44:10,643 --> 01:44:11,632
Father!

1457
01:44:12,011 --> 01:44:13,603
Tell me,
what happened?

1458
01:44:13,712 --> 01:44:17,512
How are all these changes possible?
- It's all thanks to you!

1459
01:44:17,983 --> 01:44:19,109
Thanks to me? Why?

1460
01:44:19,218 --> 01:44:22,676
Because when children
go from being bad to good...

1461
01:44:22,788 --> 01:44:27,384
...they have the power to instill
a new, cheerful, and serene air...

1462
01:44:27,493 --> 01:44:29,290
...in everything around them!

1463
01:44:30,462 --> 01:44:32,327
And the puppet?
What happened to it?

1464
01:44:32,431 --> 01:44:34,194
There it is, over there!
You see it?

1465
01:44:37,903 --> 01:44:39,564
How funny I was
when I was a puppet...

1466
01:44:39,672 --> 01:44:42,869
...and how happy I am now that
I've become a respectable boy!

1467
01:44:43,342 --> 01:44:44,604
Pinocchio?
- Yes?

1468
01:44:44,843 --> 01:44:45,867
Come here!

1469
01:44:47,413 --> 01:44:48,402
Here you go!

1470
01:44:49,148 --> 01:44:50,206
What is it?
- Your books.

1471
01:44:50,983 --> 01:44:52,780
Go to school and distinguish yourself.

1472
01:44:52,885 --> 01:44:53,943
Thank you. Bye, Father!

1473
01:44:54,053 --> 01:44:55,042
Bye, Pinocchio!

1474
01:44:59,091 --> 01:45:00,183
Bye, Pinocchio!

1475
01:45:07,232 --> 01:45:09,325
Good morning!
- This way, please!

1476
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:30,000
