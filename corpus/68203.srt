00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:36,045
<i>In the news tonight...</i>

2
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:39,416
<i>...the music world mourns the death</i>
<i>of folk music icon Irving Steinbloom...</i>

3
00:00:40,857 --> 00:00:42,984
<i>...an instrumental figure</i>
<i>in guiding folk music...</i>

4
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:48,722
<i>...from its humble beginnings in the 1 950s</i>
<i>to its zenith in popularity in the 1 960s.</i>

5
00:00:48,898 --> 00:00:52,664
<i>Steinbloom managed the careers</i>
<i>of such million-selling folk groups as...</i>

6
00:00:52,836 --> 00:00:55,361
<i>...The Main Street Singers,</i>
<i>The Folksmen...</i>

7
00:00:55,538 --> 00:00:58,905
<i>...and the sweethearts</i>
<i>of the folk music scene, Mitch and Mickey.</i>

8
00:00:59,075 --> 00:01:01,441
<i>Their music was the voice of a generation.</i>

9
00:01:01,611 --> 00:01:03,511
<i>It carried a message of peace and freedom...</i>

10
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,444
<i>...and young people got behind</i>
<i>the message in a big way.</i>

11
00:01:06,616 --> 00:01:10,052
<i>Steinbloom is survived</i>
<i>by his wife and three children.</i>

12
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:21,520
What do you say, Mitch? It's up to you.
Are you going to be with us?

13
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:25,366
Yes, we do. We have aII three FoIksmen.

14
00:01:25,568 --> 00:01:28,401
Of course, AIan, of course.
He was the first to--

15
00:01:28,571 --> 00:01:32,302
We can't imagine doing this without you.
It's as simpIe as that.

16
00:01:32,475 --> 00:01:35,569
We cannot conceive of doing this--

17
00:01:36,112 --> 00:01:41,049
It seemed that the onIy fitting tribute
to this fantastic human being--

18
00:01:41,217 --> 00:01:44,618
And I have to teII you,
my dad was reaIIy an amazing character.

19
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:51,150
And the onIy fitting tribute we couId
come up with was a memoriaI to my dad...

20
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:54,763
...that wouId be a concert
that wouId be performed...

21
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:59,834
...by aII of the fabuIous groups
and peopIe that he used to represent.

22
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:05,133
It's gonna be very fast. It's gonna be in
two weeks. And it had to be in Town HaII...

23
00:02:05,308 --> 00:02:09,369
...because where eIse couId we have
such an event? It had to be Town HaII.

24
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,140
And they had a hoIe in the scheduIe.

25
00:02:12,315 --> 00:02:14,749
But it's a very sudden hoIe...

26
00:02:14,918 --> 00:02:19,821
...and we've got two weeks
to put together this very compIicated event.

27
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,320
But I'm pretty organized myseIf.

28
00:02:24,494 --> 00:02:27,190
I've aIways been a very organized person.

29
00:02:27,363 --> 00:02:33,302
When I was 1 2, I formed the J.C.P.L.,
the Jewish ChiIdren's PoIo League.

30
00:02:33,803 --> 00:02:38,433
We rode ShetIand ponies instead of horses.
It was funny, my mom used to say:

31
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:42,100
''WeII, if he has to faII,
he shouIdn't faII from so very high.''

32
00:02:42,278 --> 00:02:45,372
She was very protective.
You couId say overIy protective.

33
00:02:45,548 --> 00:02:48,881
I just Iike to think she cared about me.
Which she did, a Iot.

34
00:02:49,052 --> 00:02:51,316
And I was a member of the chess team.

35
00:02:51,487 --> 00:02:55,446
And whenever we had chess tournaments,
I had to wear a protective heImet.

36
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:59,322
I had to wear a footbaII heImet.
Now, who knows what she was thinking?

37
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:02,123
Maybe she thought
we might have faIIen...

38
00:03:02,298 --> 00:03:05,995
...and impaIed our heads on a pointy
bishop or something, I don't know.

39
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:09,305
<i>Now they don't allow no frowns inside</i>
<i>Leave them by the door</i>

40
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:15,005
<i>-There's apple brandy by the keg</i>
<i>-And sawdust on the floor</i>

41
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:19,478
<i>So if you've got a hankering</i>
<i>I'll tell you where to go</i>

42
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:23,141
<i>Just look for the busted neon sign</i>
<i>That flashes</i>

43
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,844
<i>Ea-a-oe's</i>

44
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:31,222
<i>Well, there's a puppy in the parlor</i>
<i>And a skillet on the stove</i>

45
00:03:35,265 --> 00:03:37,392
<i>Hello, Mr. Stranger Man</i>

46
00:03:39,836 --> 00:03:41,770
-Who is that?
-Who are any of us?

47
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,237
No!

48
00:03:47,243 --> 00:03:48,938
I'II take some of that.

49
00:03:49,512 --> 00:03:53,346
-Mr. PaIter has an aItar, I see.
-Yeah. The PaIter Porch.

50
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:56,747
-I knew you Iooked famiIiar.
-Just a IittIe.

51
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,549
I think I used to work with your kids.
A coupIe of young guys....

52
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:04,215
Mark and I met at
the University of Vermont in about '61 ?

53
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:05,418
Late '61 .

54
00:04:05,595 --> 00:04:09,656
We were both interested in foIk music,
and there was a big foIk music scene...

55
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,928
...as there were on many coIIeges.
We formed The Twobadours.

56
00:04:15,104 --> 00:04:17,231
-Two. T-W-O.
-Badours.

57
00:04:17,407 --> 00:04:21,275
Because there were two of us.
That was the reasoning behind the name.

58
00:04:21,444 --> 00:04:24,902
-Mark was a bass, reaIIy, a bass singer.
-I sang way down here.

59
00:04:25,081 --> 00:04:29,381
And I was a tenor singer up there.
And so we had no Iead....

60
00:04:29,552 --> 00:04:31,543
No gIue. No middIe, no....

61
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:35,122
VocaIist. We went to New York
to see what was happening in the biz.

62
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,452
-We were pIaying at a pIace....
-The FoIk PIace.

63
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:42,121
At The FoIk PIace, which was a wonderfuI
cIub at the time and we ran into--

64
00:04:42,298 --> 00:04:44,232
It was the fIash point.
It reaIIy was.

65
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,597
Everyone-- It was Iike a big magnet,
everyone went there.

66
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,764
-He was singing, he was backing peopIe up--
-I thought I was a guitar pIayer at the time.

67
00:04:52,942 --> 00:04:58,312
If you have enough vibrato on those bIue
Fender guitars, you sound Iike a surf king.

68
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:02,542
I was drawn to the foIk music as weII
and I wound up down at The FoIk PIace...

69
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,084
...and met these two guys.

70
00:05:04,253 --> 00:05:09,088
I couId pIay the guitar. I couId sing right
in the middIe there, mostIy sang for myseIf.

71
00:05:09,258 --> 00:05:13,160
-Not a bad-Iooking gent, to boot.
-No, that's true. That didn't hurt.

72
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:16,264
We ended up getting together
and it just kind of....

73
00:05:16,432 --> 00:05:17,729
-It cIicked.
-It cIicked.

74
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,098
And Mr. Irving SteinbIoom came down
and he signed us to FoIk Town...

75
00:05:22,305 --> 00:05:24,432
-...which was the IabeI to be on.
-Terrific IabeI.

76
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:27,936
Later on we were
kind of moved down the food chain...

77
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,672
...to the FoIk Tone IabeI
which was a subsidiary.

78
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:36,049
It was a decent IabeI,
they just didn't have the distribution.

79
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:39,211
-They didn't have any distribution.
-No distribution at aII.

80
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:42,688
And the covers were printed
in two coIors instead of four...

81
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:44,850
...which I noticed was a probIem.

82
00:05:45,028 --> 00:05:48,486
And they had no hoIe
in the center of the record--

83
00:05:48,664 --> 00:05:50,495
No, you had to provide it yourseIf.

84
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:54,329
So the peopIe compIained
that you'd get this vinyI, in those days...

85
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:58,907
-...and it's up to you to center it.
-It wouId teeter craziIy on the spindIe.

86
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:02,841
And that was, of course, we had
no controI over that aspect of it.

87
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:05,242
They were stiII good records.
Good product.

88
00:06:05,415 --> 00:06:08,543
If you punched a hoIe in them,
you'd have a good time.

89
00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:13,322
<i>It's scary but it's true</i>
<i>So do what the Good Book tells you to</i>

90
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,220
<i>I guess it was in about 1 958</i>
<i>in Greenwich Village.</i>

91
00:06:22,398 --> 00:06:25,231
My partner Chuck Wiseman
and myseIf had gotten together...

92
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:27,130
...with Fred Knox and BiII Weyburn.

93
00:06:28,938 --> 00:06:33,307
We were Iucky to be joined by one
of the greatest taIents of our generation...

94
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:37,913
...any generation, as a matter of fact,
RambIin' Sandy Pitnik.

95
00:06:38,281 --> 00:06:41,409
And we became the ViIIage FoIk EnsembIe.

96
00:06:42,218 --> 00:06:45,984
And we were a great group. Great.
We had a good sound...

97
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:50,353
...but I aIways thought we shouId have
something bigger, a fuIIer sound.

98
00:06:50,526 --> 00:06:55,225
And one night in 1 960,
I'II never forget this...

99
00:06:55,398 --> 00:06:59,198
...we were at a hootenanny and we
were jamming with the KIapper FamiIy.

100
00:06:59,368 --> 00:07:03,771
And aII of a sudden, I heard it.
The sound that I'd been thinking about.

101
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,204
The harmonics were amazing.

102
00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:11,746
I thought, ''WeII, there's five of us,
there's four of them. It's a <i>neuf-</i>tet.''

103
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:15,441
And it was there, just in a moment,
it was aII there.

104
00:07:15,618 --> 00:07:17,643
The <i>neuf-</i>tet sound.

105
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,551
This thing cIicked with The KIappers
too, so we joined forces...

106
00:07:21,724 --> 00:07:23,692
...and became The Main Street Singers.

107
00:07:25,294 --> 00:07:30,891
WeII, 1 0 years and 30 aIbums Iater,
we disbanded, but we'd had a good run.

108
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:34,901
My partner Chuck Wiseman and myseIf,
we caIIed it quits too.

109
00:07:35,071 --> 00:07:38,199
I went my way and Chuck went his.

110
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:41,707
In 1 97 1 , after the breakup
of The Main Street Singers...

111
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,772
...Chuck Wiseman moved to San Francisco
where he started a business...

112
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:51,545
...with his two brothers.
The Three Wiseman's Sex Emporium.

113
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,882
It was very successfuI for a year...

114
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:57,822
...untiI they were sued over something
having to do with a box of benwa baIIs.

115
00:07:58,161 --> 00:08:01,426
No, I need you, Mitch.
I need Mitch and Mickey. Mitch and Mickey.

116
00:08:01,597 --> 00:08:04,065
That's the thing. You go together.

117
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:09,296
I Iove Mickey, but without you
it's not the same. You got to think--

118
00:08:09,972 --> 00:08:14,966
I'm gonna teII you something, Mitch,
and I've never toId anybody this before.

119
00:08:15,144 --> 00:08:17,169
You were Dad's favorite. Okay.

120
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:21,783
Just deaI with it. You were Dad's favorite.
I've never said this to a singIe souI.

121
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:26,411
Two weeks before he died
he took me aside and he said to me:

122
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:30,491
''Of aII those <i>ferkakte</i> peopIe,
I Iove Mitch, he's my favorite.

123
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,322
He's Iike a reIative,
he's Iike my nephew to me.''

124
00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:37,762
I'm saying this because I think you'd want
to know before you make your mind up.

125
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,663
WouId you just think about it?

126
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:53,779
<i>Sounds cliche, but it's kind of a blur,</i>
<i>you know? They loved us.</i>

127
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,978
I guess we were, in a way, maybe easy
to Iove because we represented...

128
00:09:01,524 --> 00:09:04,015
...true Iove and romance
and sweetness, and....

129
00:09:04,894 --> 00:09:09,092
To be quite honest, I bought
the image as much as anyone eIse.

130
00:09:09,265 --> 00:09:12,234
Maybe that's why I soId it so weII.

131
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,861
Because it was sweet and happy...

132
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:18,699
...and everybody, everybody
Ioved to hang around Mitch.

133
00:09:18,874 --> 00:09:22,901
They tried to get cIose to him,
but I was cIose to him.

134
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,577
He was very smart, very intense...

135
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:29,946
...and distant, you know?

136
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:34,249
You'd get cIose to him and he'd inch back
that much further, you know.

137
00:09:34,423 --> 00:09:38,120
And you'd move in,
you know, to get inside Mitch...

138
00:09:38,294 --> 00:09:40,421
...and he'd just back off a IittIe more.

139
00:09:40,596 --> 00:09:45,124
Just aIways kept you wanting to get there,
to understand him.

140
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:47,269
Which was impossibIe.

141
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:52,668
<i>Oh, when the veil of dreams has lifted</i>

142
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:58,239
<i>And the fairy tales have all been told</i>

143
00:09:58,414 --> 00:10:02,783
<i>There's a kiss at the end of the rainbow</i>

144
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:12,692
<i>More precious than a pot of gold</i>

145
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:20,468
The phenomenon of that kiss was....

146
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,770
It can't be overstated.

147
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:25,133
It was...

148
00:10:27,243 --> 00:10:31,805
...a superb moment
in the history of foIk music.

149
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,072
And maybe...

150
00:10:34,984 --> 00:10:38,385
...maybe a great moment
in the history of humans.

151
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:45,350
I'd Iike to think that Mitch
wouId agree to do this with me.

152
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:50,428
Because I aIready said yes.
And I can't do it aIone, so....

153
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:53,658
No, I didn't think this through.

154
00:10:53,969 --> 00:10:58,303
ShouId've taIked to him beforehand,
but I haven't taIked to him in so Iong.

155
00:10:59,675 --> 00:11:02,473
It wasn't....
We weren't taIking.

156
00:11:03,846 --> 00:11:06,337
You know, those Iast few years....

157
00:11:07,683 --> 00:11:12,950
Okay, I'm remembering some things now,
yeah. There was Iots of fighting going on.

158
00:11:13,356 --> 00:11:16,655
And I think for a whiIe we were abIe...

159
00:11:17,226 --> 00:11:20,218
...to keep it on a professionaI IeveI.

160
00:11:21,063 --> 00:11:25,056
But reaIIy, we were getting
some personaI things out.

161
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:29,265
I was just out of high schooI,
I had just started here.

162
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,033
And I must say I was in awe of Mitch
and Mickey. I mean, who wasn't?

163
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,278
They were here working on
<i>When You're Next To Me</i>...

164
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,541
...which was their Iast aIbum together.

165
00:11:41,717 --> 00:11:45,653
Mickey started shouting at Mitch.
She just went off.

166
00:11:45,821 --> 00:11:50,224
She started throwing anything she couId
get her hands on at Mitch. Anything.

167
00:11:50,593 --> 00:11:56,225
Music stands, microphone stands,
mikes, guitars.

168
00:11:56,932 --> 00:11:58,866
And Mitch....

169
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:02,499
He just....

170
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:06,067
He just snapped.

171
00:12:08,377 --> 00:12:11,244
<i>It's time to kick on back</i>
<i>Toss your cares away</i>

172
00:12:17,386 --> 00:12:22,619
<i>Cartwheels and piggybacks</i>
<i>It's just that kind of day</i>

173
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:29,753
<i>I'm sitting on a hill</i>
<i>Watching clouds at play</i>

174
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:34,067
WeII, I've been pIaying
the music of The Main Street Singers...

175
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:38,002
...my whoIe Iife, I mean,
from way back in Tampa.

176
00:12:38,374 --> 00:12:42,777
I've come to understand as an aduIt,
with the heIp of Laurie, my beautifuI wife...

177
00:12:45,714 --> 00:12:51,744
...that there had been abuse in my famiIy,
but it was mostIy musicaI in nature.

178
00:12:51,921 --> 00:12:55,379
My father used to
Iock me away in a room...

179
00:12:55,558 --> 00:12:59,619
...with nothing but the Percy Faith
recording of ''Bim Bam Boom'' ...

180
00:12:59,795 --> 00:13:03,356
...and then send me to bed
with nothing but dessert.

181
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:07,258
One of the records he put me
in there with was <i>Sunny Side Up</i>.

182
00:13:07,436 --> 00:13:09,097
The Main Street Singers, 1 968.

183
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:13,203
I teII you, my head opened up,
my heart opened up.

184
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,139
I Iistened to that record
over and over and over.

185
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:18,974
I knew it right and Ieft
and every way to Sunday.

186
00:13:19,148 --> 00:13:24,950
I feeI Iike I knew those peopIe.
I wanted to be in that group so badIy...

187
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,386
...that at the age of 8 years oId,
I went down into the basement...

188
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:34,154
...and I made cardboard cutouts of
everybody in the group to sing with them.

189
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,788
These were my friends,
and they were made out of gin boxes.

190
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,194
It's odd that Laurie
came from such a different--

191
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,429
Right. A compIeteIy different path.

192
00:13:43,606 --> 00:13:47,599
I was brought up in a very smaII town,
south of the Chicago city Iimits.

193
00:13:47,776 --> 00:13:52,577
Just far enough away to have been peopIed
with pure, unaduIterated white trash.

194
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:56,980
And because I was one of so many chiIdren,
I don't beIieve that anyone noticed...

195
00:13:57,152 --> 00:14:02,112
...when I bIew town at 1 5
and ended up in San Francisco, CaIifornia.

196
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:06,193
And it's at this point in my story
that the dark cIouds part...

197
00:14:06,362 --> 00:14:11,664
...because I met a certain Mr. Wiseman,
who gave me a job in his shop.

198
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:15,270
And before Iong, he tapped me
to do some smaII roIes...

199
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:20,500
...in some of his short fiIms
for more mature audiences.

200
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:24,442
And before Iong, I had Ianded,
if you wiII, some Ieads...

201
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:28,447
...and then I started to do some cameos.

202
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:33,420
WeII, I was known for
doing a certain thing...

203
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:36,524
...that many of the other girIs
wouIdn't do.

204
00:14:36,892 --> 00:14:40,089
Of course, I Ioved to sing,
ever since I was a IittIe girI.

205
00:14:40,262 --> 00:14:45,700
And I Iearned to pIay the ukuIeIe
in one of my Iast fiIms, <i>Not So Tiny Tim</i>.

206
00:14:45,868 --> 00:14:48,302
And based on that, my worId opened up...

207
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,304
...because I was invited to join the
re-formed New Main Street Singers.

208
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:58,344
And that's where I met my man,
and before Iong I was the new Mrs. Bohner.

209
00:14:58,514 --> 00:15:00,243
Ain't that something?

210
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,008
-A beautifuI story.
-I teII you.

211
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:05,845
Last week you were
going to come in at 5...

212
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:09,047
...and you never showed up.
It's okay, it's just that--

213
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:10,885
-He's in. Mitch is in.
-ReaIIy?

214
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,392
-It's unbeIievabIe.
-CongratuIations!

215
00:15:13,562 --> 00:15:16,725
-Thank you. Thank you.
-He said he wouId be a part of this?

216
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:19,265
-Yes.
-He said that just now on the phone?

217
00:15:19,435 --> 00:15:22,802
-Yeah, I think he did.
-Did he put it in writing?

218
00:15:23,906 --> 00:15:26,466
I'm sorr--
I'm just Iooking out for you.

219
00:15:26,642 --> 00:15:29,770
Let's not rain on the parade, okay?
He's in.

220
00:15:30,713 --> 00:15:35,241
In 1 974, after the breakup,
Mitch was extremeIy angry.

221
00:15:35,784 --> 00:15:37,615
His first soIo aIbum...

222
00:15:37,886 --> 00:15:41,287
...a <i>Cry For Help</i>, contained
numbers Iike ''If I Had A Gun'' ...

223
00:15:42,925 --> 00:15:46,361
...''Anyone But You,'' ''May She Rot in HeII.''

224
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:50,794
And this just spiraIed down...

225
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:53,366
...to the next aIbum, <i>Calling It Quits</i>.

226
00:15:55,504 --> 00:15:58,701
And at that point he was in a very bad way.

227
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:23,489
There was a Iot of anger in Mitch...

228
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:30,070
...for reasons, you know, that he had.

229
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,799
I think he went too soon.

230
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:38,336
He shouId have stayed Ionger,
because we reaIIy didn't get a grip on him.

231
00:16:40,883 --> 00:16:45,286
And his anger was unheaIthy...

232
00:16:45,988 --> 00:16:48,684
...for aII of us.

233
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:56,828
-HeIIo, Mickey.
-Mitch.

234
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:58,660
-How are you?
-Great.

235
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:01,029
-It's good to see you.
-You too. So....

236
00:17:01,203 --> 00:17:05,105
-Mitch Cohen, this is my husband.
-Leonard Crabbe, very nice to meet you.

237
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,936
-It's nice to meet you.
-WeIcome to the house of Crabbe.

238
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,876
Thank you very much.
I just checked into the hoteI.

239
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:15,346
Left my things there.

240
00:17:15,517 --> 00:17:17,417
-Good.
-Which hoteI was that, then?

241
00:17:17,586 --> 00:17:20,146
I don't know the name.

242
00:17:20,422 --> 00:17:22,856
I can't remember the name,
but it's very nice.

243
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:25,186
Are you hungry?

244
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,294
-Yes.
-Good. Lunch is not quite ready.

245
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,091
Maybe you'd Iike to
take Mitch to see your trains?

246
00:17:30,265 --> 00:17:31,960
Oh, yes. Do you Iike trains?

247
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:34,198
I took a bus.

248
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:38,305
No. ModeI trains.
Do you Iike modeI trains?

249
00:17:38,941 --> 00:17:41,000
-Sure.
-It's a bit of a passion for me.

250
00:17:41,176 --> 00:17:43,667
I'II show you around.
It's right down here.

251
00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:47,509
-It was a 1 6-hour trip.
-This wiII be quicker than that.

252
00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:58,655
This whoIe area here is caIIed Crabbe Town.

253
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:01,921
We've got a brotheI
down there above the saIoon.

254
00:18:02,397 --> 00:18:06,493
And right down there, further aIong,
I'm thinking of buiIding a French Quarter.

255
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:12,903
-I've actuaIIy got a bit of French bIood.
-I'd Iove to see this town in the autumn.

256
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:18,678
I think CrabbeviIIe in autumn
wouId Iook quite magnificent.

257
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:22,977
I wouId have made tiny IittIe Ieaves...

258
00:18:23,152 --> 00:18:27,248
...oak, popIar, mapIe, chestnut...

259
00:18:27,422 --> 00:18:33,258
...and spread them
across the town of CrabbeviIIe.

260
00:18:33,896 --> 00:18:36,023
Magnificent.

261
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,563
It's Crabbe Town, not CrabbeviIIe.

262
00:18:54,683 --> 00:18:58,016
What is it you do, Leonard?

263
00:19:00,122 --> 00:19:01,555
For work?

264
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,753
Oh, work.

265
00:19:03,926 --> 00:19:06,952
I'm in the bIadder management industry.

266
00:19:07,129 --> 00:19:09,029
I seII catheters.

267
00:19:09,198 --> 00:19:13,464
I have my own distribution company.
Sure-FIo MedicaI AppIiances.

268
00:19:13,635 --> 00:19:15,068
May have heard of it.

269
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,866
It's actuaIIy named in tribute after
my mother. Her name was FIorence.

270
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:24,308
It's a growth industry, reaIIy,
because one in three peopIe over 60...

271
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:27,676
...either have a fIaccid
or a spastic bIadder...

272
00:19:28,217 --> 00:19:33,086
...so, in a sense, every 1 3.5 seconds,
a new incontinent is born, as it were.

273
00:19:33,822 --> 00:19:37,121
PeopIe Iike you and I have
what they caII ''Ieakage probIems.''

274
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:41,023
They can be running, pIaying tennis,
Iaughing, sneezing, anything.

275
00:19:41,196 --> 00:19:43,027
The good oId constipation, you know?

276
00:19:43,198 --> 00:19:46,964
You have impacted fecaI mass
in your rectum pushing on your bIadder.

277
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:50,866
This might make good dessert taIk.

278
00:19:51,707 --> 00:19:56,804
I started pIaying foIk cIubs
in New York City...

279
00:19:56,979 --> 00:20:01,746
...and waIked into one such
coffeehouse one night and there--

280
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:06,544
-HaIf Moon Cafe.
-The HaIf Moon Cafe and--

281
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:10,522
I was pIaying with my sisters,
JoceIyn, CIaire, EsteIIe.

282
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:12,387
We were the North Four.

283
00:20:12,561 --> 00:20:15,587
We were on-stage
and we had a horribIe IittIe heckIer.

284
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:18,858
A IittIe guy, but with
the Ioudest voice in the worId.

285
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:24,563
And just, you know, ''Take off your tops''
and ''Get off the stage'' ....

286
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:29,336
''You sing Iike crap! You get off the stage!''

287
00:20:29,511 --> 00:20:33,777
Very inarticuIate. Rude.

288
00:20:33,949 --> 00:20:36,076
Mean. Mean IittIe bugger.

289
00:20:36,251 --> 00:20:39,778
AII of a sudden, we couIdn't see cIear,
you got the Iights on us...

290
00:20:39,955 --> 00:20:44,619
...but I see this taII, dark figure go over
and there's this intense IittIe...

291
00:20:44,793 --> 00:20:48,889
...something going on,
and aII of a sudden, he's pummeIed.

292
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:53,834
-The crap pummeIed out of him.
-I don't remember much.

293
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:59,531
But the next thing I know,
I'm in a hospitaI, and the first thing I saw...

294
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:06,170
...was a beautifuI rose sitting in a vase
on the night tabIe next to the bed.

295
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,484
And I can't express...

296
00:21:09,651 --> 00:21:15,317
...what was surging through my body.

297
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:19,417
I was consumed with an emotion...

298
00:21:19,594 --> 00:21:23,530
...that I had never feIt before.

299
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:27,958
We started singing together.

300
00:21:29,071 --> 00:21:32,563
We simpIy fused together...

301
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:36,074
...in a very meaningfuI way.

302
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,740
And before you know it, we were recording.

303
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:42,840
-I Iearned to sing with Mitch.
-And--

304
00:21:43,018 --> 00:21:46,613
So scary, so scary. But I just....

305
00:21:46,788 --> 00:21:50,053
Mitch was so strong and so smart
and knew what he wanted...

306
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:53,126
...and I just focused on Mitch.

307
00:21:53,996 --> 00:21:56,157
You know,
I went aIong for the ride.

308
00:21:56,832 --> 00:21:58,800
<i>One, two, three, and....</i>

309
00:22:00,635 --> 00:22:05,231
-Wait. I doubIed after you?
-No, with me. That's doubIing.

310
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:09,935
-You cIimb aboard the ferry at the same time.
-Okay, fair enough.

311
00:22:10,112 --> 00:22:12,046
One, two, three, and....

312
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:30,530
<i>My mama was the cold north wind</i>

313
00:22:30,699 --> 00:22:35,329
<i>My daddy was the son of a railroad man</i>

314
00:22:35,504 --> 00:22:41,568
<i>From west of hell</i>
<i>Where the trains don't even run</i>

315
00:22:42,511 --> 00:22:46,003
<i>Never heard the whistle</i>
<i>Of a southbound freight</i>

316
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:49,514
<i>Or the humming of its driving wheel</i>

317
00:22:49,684 --> 00:22:53,814
<i>No, I never did no wandering</i>

318
00:22:53,989 --> 00:22:57,982
<i>Never did no wandering</i>

319
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:03,359
<i>Never did no wandering after all</i>

320
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:12,306
I just, sorry, I just got a mentaI picture
in my mind of us on-stage in the show.

321
00:23:12,841 --> 00:23:18,211
And we weren't wearing the oId stuff,
the oId gear, the oId....

322
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:22,783
We're taIking about the dickeys?
I think I'm on record as Mr. Anti-dickey.

323
00:23:22,951 --> 00:23:25,146
You were Mr. Drop-the-dickey.

324
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,348
-It's just a very retro Iook.
-I'm totaIIy avaiIabIe for the discussion of it.

325
00:23:30,525 --> 00:23:33,790
It sounds Iike you're thinking
the image that we had...

326
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:38,058
...was a retro image of something that
wasn't retro because we weren't retro...

327
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:41,100
-...because we were then.
-It wasn't retro then...

328
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:44,568
...but now, to try a retro thing,
it might just Iook kind of sad.

329
00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:47,139
-I mean....
-To do then now wouId be retro.

330
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:51,245
To do then then
was very now-tro, if you wiII.

331
00:23:53,215 --> 00:23:57,413
I know we're getting emotionaI with things
and I know we want to give this...

332
00:23:57,586 --> 00:24:00,817
...to be a great thing for you know who,
but I'm Iooking at numbers--

333
00:24:00,989 --> 00:24:04,117
For Dad. Can't you say it? For Dad.

334
00:24:05,227 --> 00:24:07,593
You can't say his name, can you?

335
00:24:07,762 --> 00:24:10,629
You're not the onIy one
that's thinking about Dad now.

336
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,596
You're not the onIy person
going through this--

337
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:16,965
You don't have to take everything personaIIy.
It's not you. It's her. Forgive me.

338
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:18,902
I'm sorry. Forgive me. Never mind.

339
00:24:19,074 --> 00:24:22,202
This isn't reaIIy just
a reunion for the foIk groups.

340
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:26,143
It's aIso a reunion for the SteinbIoom famiIy,
minus Dad, of course.

341
00:24:27,983 --> 00:24:31,077
-Because we never get together.
-Not reaIIy.

342
00:24:32,154 --> 00:24:36,318
-We taIk. A Iot. We taIk a Iot.
-We taIk on the phone a Iot.

343
00:24:36,491 --> 00:24:40,120
-We don't reaIIy see each other.
-No. We don't need to.

344
00:24:40,295 --> 00:24:42,058
I moved away to North Dakota.

345
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:45,629
I tried to get far away
to get the singing out of my head.

346
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,567
I didn't care for foIk music
and Dad knew that. I just didn't get it.

347
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:54,072
So I haven't kept up our ties.
That's why this is kind of nice.

348
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,904
HopefuIIy we can get
through our IittIe things...

349
00:24:57,078 --> 00:25:00,946
...and put on a good show for Dad.

350
00:25:01,116 --> 00:25:05,246
You Iike to make amends, but you can't,
so we'II try to do it with one good--

351
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,978
Music.

352
00:25:08,723 --> 00:25:10,452
You okay?

353
00:25:11,193 --> 00:25:14,390
Let's just hang on.

354
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,225
Oh, Jesus.

355
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:34,414
My dad, Fred Knox,
was an originaI Main Street Singer...

356
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:36,551
...so I grew up with this kind of music.

357
00:25:39,221 --> 00:25:42,122
So I Iistened to it when I was IittIe.

358
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:46,249
But I didn't hear much of it when
I was a teenager because I was--

359
00:25:47,996 --> 00:25:50,191
I was on the streets.

360
00:25:50,365 --> 00:25:53,334
I was reaIIy rescued by
The New Main Street Singers...

361
00:25:53,501 --> 00:25:57,835
...and they reaIIy
gave me a break from that...

362
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,735
...dark, that darkness.

363
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:03,639
And....
So I Iike to give peopIe a break now.

364
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:07,714
So when I sing, I want
to give out what was given to me.

365
00:26:07,882 --> 00:26:10,908
And I want to be, you know,
a vesseI of Iove...

366
00:26:11,086 --> 00:26:14,852
...and I want to entertain
and make peopIe happy.

367
00:26:15,023 --> 00:26:20,154
So I Iook for someone out in the audience
and that's what brings me reaI joy.

368
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:23,786
So when Mr. MenscheII
caIIed me in 1 995, my dad died...

369
00:26:23,965 --> 00:26:30,097
...and asked me to be a part
of this band, I said:

370
00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:32,673
''WeII, yeah.''

371
00:26:38,113 --> 00:26:41,947
<i>Going home</i>
<i>I'm going</i>

372
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,550
<i>Go--</i>
<i>Going</i>

373
00:26:45,487 --> 00:26:47,387
<i>Go</i>

374
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:56,227
<i>Going home</i>
<i>I'm going home</i>

375
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,593
<i>Home</i>

376
00:27:07,676 --> 00:27:10,543
<i>Home</i>

377
00:27:12,681 --> 00:27:14,649
<i>Go--</i>

378
00:27:20,322 --> 00:27:24,349
Quick pIugoIa, I'm Mike LaFontaine, owner
and founder of Hi-CIass Management.

379
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,723
Comic's constant companion.

380
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,958
Let's start right out.
Hey, wha' happened?

381
00:27:33,134 --> 00:27:38,595
As you know, back in 1 970....
I starred on a series caIIed, <i>Wha' Happened.</i>

382
00:27:38,773 --> 00:27:41,799
Every time something wouId go wrong,
I'd Iook at the camera and say:

383
00:27:41,976 --> 00:27:44,240
''Hey, wha' happened?''

384
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,972
We had fun with that
and other catch phrases.

385
00:27:47,148 --> 00:27:49,548
''I got a reaI red wagon!''

386
00:27:49,718 --> 00:27:53,210
And, ''I can't do my work!''

387
00:27:53,388 --> 00:27:58,325
And I beIieve I was the first one
to use the phrase, ''I don't think so!''

388
00:27:58,493 --> 00:28:02,122
It Iasted a year. That's good because
that's how you estabIish a cuIt.

389
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:08,830
I was on-stage doing my shtick, ''Hey,
wha' happened?'' and ''I can't do my work!''

390
00:28:09,003 --> 00:28:12,439
If someone wouId heckIe me, they'd
say, ''WiII you be on-stage aII night?''

391
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:15,940
I wouId say, ''That's right!''
and that wouId crack up the audience.

392
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:20,172
But I noticed a guy sitting down front
with a Iong face, nothing got to him.

393
00:28:20,348 --> 00:28:22,111
So I said to the Iady next to him:

394
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:25,980
''HoId your mirror up in front
of his nose to see if he's breathing.

395
00:28:26,154 --> 00:28:29,885
To see if there's a refIection.''
So he started to smiIe.

396
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:34,893
After the show I go down and introduce
myseIf. His name is George MenscheII.

397
00:28:35,063 --> 00:28:38,055
He had been with a group caIIed
The Main Street Singers.

398
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:43,034
I was never into foIk music.
I'd worked some biIIs with some foIkies.

399
00:28:43,204 --> 00:28:46,605
<i>Put him in a cell with a long hose on him</i>
<i>Put him in a cell with a long hose on him</i>

400
00:28:46,775 --> 00:28:49,369
I used to say,
''If he's got a Iong enough hose...

401
00:28:49,544 --> 00:28:52,138
...he's gonna have friends
in the shower room!''

402
00:28:53,214 --> 00:28:56,775
FoIk audiences hated that joke.
But I said to George, I said:

403
00:28:56,951 --> 00:28:59,749
''SeriousIy, you've put up
some great numbers.

404
00:28:59,921 --> 00:29:04,381
If you re-form your group, I can send
you out on the Starfish Cruise Lines.

405
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,653
Together, we couId make a fortune
and you wiII have a baII.''

406
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:13,267
They used to go out, come back, they had
a great time. Except a coupIe of cruises...

407
00:29:13,435 --> 00:29:16,302
...dysentery broke out on the ship.
I was not there.

408
00:29:16,471 --> 00:29:19,668
You do not want to be on a cruise ship
when dysentery breaks out...

409
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:23,242
...and knock on the men's room door,
''WiII you be coming out soon?'' ...

410
00:29:23,411 --> 00:29:25,709
...and hear, ''I don't think so!''

411
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:28,879
I'm so gIad to be here.
I Iove the network.

412
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:31,484
I Iove what you do here.
I watch it constantIy.

413
00:29:33,655 --> 00:29:37,591
That's what I wanted to start by saying.
I think you're doing a fabuIous job.

414
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:41,217
And I'm very, very happy
to be here taIking with you.

415
00:29:41,396 --> 00:29:44,024
It's a perfect fit.
Our demographics are skewing oIder...

416
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,191
...and that can be a minus
with corporate underwriters.

417
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:51,702
In this case, it's a pIus because
of the buiIt-in fans for The FoIksmen...

418
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,171
...aII the groups
that your dad represented.

419
00:29:54,342 --> 00:29:59,109
And, you know, I think it's gonna
do very weII in the evening hours...

420
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,840
...which is when we'd propose
to do this concert.

421
00:30:02,016 --> 00:30:06,646
If you don't mind me saying, our audience
for some of these groups is getting younger.

422
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:09,449
Not radicaIIy younger.
Which I hope is aII right.

423
00:30:09,624 --> 00:30:13,321
If we can get two dozen young peopIe
watching in the evening hours...

424
00:30:13,495 --> 00:30:17,556
...I think peopIe here wouId be happy
because we don't have much of that now.

425
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:20,200
This is great and I want to teII you...

426
00:30:20,368 --> 00:30:25,169
...if you're not weary of hearing stories about
your dad, I want to teII you a IittIe story.

427
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:30,573
A young kid by the name of Lars OIfen,
in 1 966, going to a concert.

428
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:33,578
I'm 1 6 years oId and it was raining.

429
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:38,378
And I got right up to the box office
and Iike some kind of practicaI joke...

430
00:30:38,553 --> 00:30:41,647
...the door sIammed shut.
SoId out, right when I got there.

431
00:30:41,823 --> 00:30:45,782
My young tears mixed with the rain,
I'm waIking away and I hear a voice.

432
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,690
''Hey, kid, over here.''
And I go, ''What, a scaIper?

433
00:30:48,863 --> 00:30:51,764
Who is this guy? I can't afford
that kind of money for a ticket.''

434
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,561
But he Iooks kind of famiIiar
and I go over there.

435
00:30:54,736 --> 00:30:57,671
He hands me two tickets,
doesn't want a doIIar.

436
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:01,206
It's your father. Why wouId he do that?

437
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:04,606
That was Dad, you know.
He was just out there, with peopIe.

438
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:09,341
And he was generous, he was kind and
reaIIy that's why we're doing this thing...

439
00:31:09,517 --> 00:31:12,782
...to pay back this much back
to his memory.

440
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:16,515
The <i>naches</i> I'm feeIing right now.
Your dad was Iike <i>mishpoche</i> to me.

441
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:20,422
When I heard I got these tickets to
The FoIksmen, I Iet out a <i>geshreeyeh</i>...

442
00:31:20,595 --> 00:31:23,223
...and I'm running with
my friend Iike a <i>vilde chaye</i>...

443
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:25,923
...right into the theater,
in the front row.

444
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,364
We've got the <i>schpilkes</i>
because we're sitting right there.

445
00:31:28,536 --> 00:31:32,370
It's a <i>mitzvah</i> what your dad did,
and I want to try to give that back to you.

446
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:35,065
<i>Okeinhoreh</i>, I say, and God bIess him.

447
00:31:37,078 --> 00:31:40,047
Where did I go up? I remember hitting a....

448
00:31:40,214 --> 00:31:42,842
<i>We shared a song</i>

449
00:31:43,017 --> 00:31:45,884
I think it might be on ''the ravens,''
on ''the ravens.''

450
00:31:46,054 --> 00:31:48,579
''We shared.''
I think you might stay beIow me on--

451
00:31:48,756 --> 00:31:50,781
Stay on: <i>We shared</i>

452
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:52,551
<i>Wandered</i>

453
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:57,221
<i>Wandered through each other's secrets</i>

454
00:31:57,398 --> 00:31:59,866
<i>We traded</i>

455
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:02,634
<i>We traded</i>

456
00:32:02,804 --> 00:32:06,706
You're right! Mitch, you're right!
Oh, I forgot that.

457
00:32:06,874 --> 00:32:12,107
<i>We traded an honored worth</i>

458
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,377
That's it, nice and crisp!

459
00:32:18,553 --> 00:32:20,487
That's very nice.

460
00:32:20,655 --> 00:32:24,557
<i>Walking down to Main Street</i>
<i>Everybody's gonna sing</i>

461
00:32:24,726 --> 00:32:26,216
There you go.

462
00:32:30,298 --> 00:32:33,199
What are you singing there?
You got the root on ''sing''?

463
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,733
You singing the root?

464
00:32:34,902 --> 00:32:38,030
No, I was singing:
<i>Everybody's gonna sing</i>

465
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,333
Didn't I give you a sixth?

466
00:32:40,575 --> 00:32:43,169
-I don't think so.
-Tony, I give him a sixth?

467
00:32:43,344 --> 00:32:45,244
I think you were singing the sixth.

468
00:32:45,413 --> 00:32:47,973
-Can you sing me a sixth?
-CouId you sing a sixth?

469
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:50,344
<i>-Everybody gonna sing</i>
<i>-Everybody gonna sing</i>

470
00:32:50,518 --> 00:32:54,010
-Yeah, I can sing that. Sure.
-Let's try it again. One, two, three.

471
00:32:54,622 --> 00:32:56,419
What? Yeah?

472
00:32:56,591 --> 00:32:58,855
-Go ahead.
-You have a probIem in the bridge?

473
00:32:59,027 --> 00:33:00,289
No, I was gonna--

474
00:33:00,461 --> 00:33:02,861
Can I switch?
Can I change out of my costume?

475
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,430
Costume? Are you hot?

476
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,194
Yeah. But aIso, I mean...

477
00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:10,166
...I've been wearing it for a month.

478
00:33:10,338 --> 00:33:11,862
You know the poIicy.

479
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,441
We aII gotta wear the uniform
untiI we're ready to take it off.

480
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:18,374
You're cIose, I just don't think
you're quite there yet.

481
00:33:18,546 --> 00:33:21,947
You did not sing that sixth,
and I want to see you sing that sixth.

482
00:33:22,116 --> 00:33:24,482
You just wear what you have on.
You sound fine.

483
00:33:24,652 --> 00:33:28,315
EventuaIIy you'II be abIe to wear
your civvies when you're singing.

484
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,921
Jonathan? Hi.

485
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,583
WeII, I got good news and better news.

486
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:39,461
Good news is, we're stiII doing the concert.
The better news is, we are going Iive.

487
00:33:39,634 --> 00:33:41,101
Yeah.

488
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:45,262
I got a friend, at NO AA, so we're going up
in the Nimbus 7 Oceanographic SateIIite.

489
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,739
He's got some bandwidth there,
and it's Iive!

490
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:51,811
Yeah, the corporate underwriters
wouIdn't go for it, so....

491
00:33:53,681 --> 00:33:56,411
I'm excited too!

492
00:33:57,385 --> 00:33:59,649
Okay. Okay.

493
00:33:59,821 --> 00:34:01,345
<i>Shalom.</i>

494
00:34:01,522 --> 00:34:03,717
<i>Folk music is in my blood.</i>

495
00:34:04,092 --> 00:34:09,223
As a young boy, in Sweden-- I was born
there and came here at an earIy age...

496
00:34:09,397 --> 00:34:13,128
...but we'd go back to Sweden every
year, my famiIy and I, in the winter...

497
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,769
...which was a fIip from the normaI thing.

498
00:34:15,937 --> 00:34:20,135
Every OIfen kid, Lars, Sven, Pippi
and Liv, was trained on the duIcimer.

499
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:24,870
When you couId hoId a rattIe, you'd
hoId a duIcimer. And we Iearned to pIay.

500
00:34:25,046 --> 00:34:29,346
I had a garage band in StockhoIm,
which was a chaIIenge in its own right...

501
00:34:29,517 --> 00:34:32,111
...to keep an instrument tuned
with that temperature swing.

502
00:34:32,286 --> 00:34:35,016
There's a bIock warmer
for the VoIvo in the garage...

503
00:34:35,189 --> 00:34:37,657
...but it's coId in there in the winter.

504
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,521
So we pIayed and I had a hit
that you might have heard of.

505
00:34:41,896 --> 00:34:45,696
Which means, ''How's It Hanging, Grandma?''
and it was big on the Swedish charts.

506
00:34:45,867 --> 00:34:50,304
I got in touch with the American music.
I Ioved that and thrived on that...

507
00:34:50,471 --> 00:34:53,634
...so I came here
and became part of that scene.

508
00:34:53,808 --> 00:34:58,302
I'm so happy to be here and come
fuII circIe, airing this show on PBN.

509
00:34:58,479 --> 00:35:00,379
It's a dream come true.

510
00:35:00,548 --> 00:35:04,712
<i>I worked the fields my father worked</i>

511
00:35:04,886 --> 00:35:07,514
<i>From dawn till setting sun</i>

512
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:08,916
Then it quiets down.

513
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:12,719
<i>And the skeletons of Quinto</i>

514
00:35:12,894 --> 00:35:15,522
<i>Call me home</i>

515
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:24,801
''The siIver tentacIes of the moon's rays
haunt me....''

516
00:35:24,972 --> 00:35:28,237
That's reaIIy getting confusing.
It's reaIIy confusing.

517
00:35:28,409 --> 00:35:32,709
It's reaIIy confusing. I'm hearing you
the same timbre, and it's cIuttered.

518
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,906
Maybe if I did it higher
and he did it Iower--

519
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:41,612
-If you do what you did before.
-I can't get that much higher.

520
00:35:41,789 --> 00:35:45,520
But that's-- Now it sounds
aImost more Iike a ventriIoquist.

521
00:35:45,693 --> 00:35:49,424
Can I make the radicaI suggestion
that maybe this is not the best number...

522
00:35:49,597 --> 00:35:53,363
...to start with?
This is a Iive teIevision show.

523
00:35:53,534 --> 00:35:56,230
We don't want peopIe
to reach for their remotes here.

524
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,372
It's pubIic teIevision.
I don't think....

525
00:35:58,539 --> 00:35:59,972
-They don't have remotes.
-Yeah.

526
00:36:01,676 --> 00:36:05,544
<i>My God, that's terrible. What do you mean</i>
<i>he won't come out of the room?</i>

527
00:36:05,713 --> 00:36:09,774
Have you taIked to him? Has he taIked to
a doctor? Have you given him medication?

528
00:36:09,951 --> 00:36:13,182
I know he's anxious.
I'm aIways anxious. I come out.

529
00:36:13,354 --> 00:36:15,845
You know, I mean,
we gotta do something.

530
00:36:16,023 --> 00:36:19,117
You want me to-- You mean,
I'm supposed to taIk to him?

531
00:36:19,293 --> 00:36:22,126
I Iike him, I don't have that much
to say to him.

532
00:36:22,296 --> 00:36:25,390
I couId be empathetic.
I'm not sure what eIse I couId do.

533
00:36:25,566 --> 00:36:28,592
I couId sit, I couId try.
Anything, we have to do something.

534
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:33,570
I'II taIk to him. I'm happy to.
I gotta get him out of there.

535
00:36:33,741 --> 00:36:38,371
We're not broadcasting from a moteI room.
We gotta get him out of there.

536
00:36:39,046 --> 00:36:42,277
<i>What's happening here?</i>
<i>Could you run your hand over that?</i>

537
00:36:42,717 --> 00:36:46,380
-What are you getting?
-WeII, I'm getting a bounce.

538
00:36:46,554 --> 00:36:49,045
But there's a Iightness within it, as weII.

539
00:36:49,223 --> 00:36:53,057
Interesting. You know, honey,
it's a very tricky coIor.

540
00:36:53,227 --> 00:36:57,220
<i>Terry and I worship</i>
<i>an unconventional deity.</i>

541
00:36:57,398 --> 00:37:00,390
The power of another dimension.

542
00:37:00,902 --> 00:37:05,839
Now, you're not going to read about this
dimension in a book, or in a magazine...

543
00:37:06,007 --> 00:37:07,565
...or in a newspaper...

544
00:37:07,742 --> 00:37:10,643
...because it doesn't exist anywhere...

545
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:13,302
...except in my own mind.

546
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:17,777
Through our ceremonies and our rituaIs...

547
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,614
...we have witnessed firsthand...

548
00:37:20,788 --> 00:37:25,384
...the awesome
and vibratory power of coIor.

549
00:37:26,694 --> 00:37:29,458
We experience it as aIive...

550
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:33,259
...and constantIy shaping
our experience.

551
00:37:33,434 --> 00:37:37,734
And we beIieve that
this saturated energy...

552
00:37:37,905 --> 00:37:42,535
...is the basis of aII creation.

553
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:47,170
We are WINC. W-I-N-C.

554
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:51,842
Witches In Nature's CoIors. WINC.

555
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:58,724
<i>The word ''witch '' may be a problem for</i>
<i>some of you. It has silly connotations.</i>

556
00:37:58,893 --> 00:38:03,762
No, we do not ride around
on broomsticks and wear pointy hat--

557
00:38:03,931 --> 00:38:06,092
WeII, we don't ride on broomsticks.

558
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:08,628
This is not an occuIt science.

559
00:38:08,803 --> 00:38:12,967
This is not one of those crazy systems...

560
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,540
...of divination and astroIogy.
That's hooey...

561
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,645
...and you gotta have a screw Ioose
to go in for it.

562
00:38:18,813 --> 00:38:23,147
Our beIiefs are fairIy commonpIace
and simpIe to understand.

563
00:38:23,317 --> 00:38:26,650
Humankind is simpIy materiaIized coIor...

564
00:38:26,821 --> 00:38:30,086
...operating on the 49th vibration.
You'd make that concIusion...

565
00:38:30,257 --> 00:38:32,782
...waIking down the street
or going to the store.

566
00:38:33,995 --> 00:38:36,964
<i>I know this is a lot of pressure</i>
<i>for you to be under.</i>

567
00:38:37,131 --> 00:38:40,760
And I don't want you to feeI you have
to push yourseIf too far. Okay?

568
00:38:40,935 --> 00:38:43,426
This is a one-day-at-a-time kind of thing.

569
00:38:43,604 --> 00:38:46,573
Don't think you have to achieve anything
right away.

570
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:50,268
Very important to back off the pressure.
Okay?

571
00:38:50,444 --> 00:38:54,574
There's a deception here.
The audience...

572
00:38:55,216 --> 00:38:59,084
...they're expecting to see a man
who no Ionger exists.

573
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,778
WeII, you know, that may be true.

574
00:39:03,157 --> 00:39:05,955
It might indeed be true.

575
00:39:06,127 --> 00:39:07,754
But I think what you have--

576
00:39:08,496 --> 00:39:10,862
-Oh, baby.
-Oh, baby.

577
00:39:13,401 --> 00:39:15,426
Can I--?

578
00:39:27,581 --> 00:39:29,242
<i>Loco man</i>

579
00:39:29,417 --> 00:39:32,477
<i>Watching all the fish swim away</i>

580
00:39:33,087 --> 00:39:36,454
<i>He no work</i>
<i>He just sleep and play</i>

581
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,058
<i>Sitting here on the sand</i>

582
00:39:39,226 --> 00:39:41,660
TaIking about the <i>loco</i> man.

583
00:39:41,829 --> 00:39:43,490
<i>Sunny land</i>

584
00:39:43,664 --> 00:39:47,156
<i>Coconut coming down all the time</i>

00:39:47,334 --> 00:39:49,802
<i>Milk, she sweeter than honey wine</i>

586
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:53,466
<i>Sitting here on the sand</i>

00:40:04,185 --> 00:40:06,915
<i>Crosstrees humming a morning hymn</i>

00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:11,254
<i>-I'm the cabin boy, call me Jim</i>
<i>-His name's Jim</i>

00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,687

<i>Under main top sail</i>

592
00:40:13,861 --> 00:40:17,262
<i>To the furbelow of the wily whale</i>

593
00:40:17,431 --> 00:40:21,265
HoId on. One second, pIease.
I got an idea. Very Iiterate reference.

594
00:40:21,435 --> 00:40:25,098
Are you famiIiar with a book about
a pirate captain, his name is Moby Dick?

595
00:40:25,272 --> 00:40:26,967
He was chasing some big whaIe.

596
00:40:27,141 --> 00:40:30,474
He had a catch phrase he'd aIways
yeII out, ''There she bIows!''

597
00:40:30,644 --> 00:40:34,774
If you couId do that, we'd have someone
off-stage drench the group with water.

598
00:40:34,949 --> 00:40:38,407
And you couId Iook at the camera
and say, ''Hey, wha' happened?''

599
00:40:38,586 --> 00:40:40,850
And every time,
another thing of water....

600
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:43,956
And by the end you're aII soaked,
even the Iadies....

601
00:40:47,461 --> 00:40:51,329
At the end of the song you turn the
guitars over and water spIashes out.

602
00:40:51,499 --> 00:40:53,490
KerpIunk!

603
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:54,895
It's just a thought.

604
00:40:55,069 --> 00:41:00,439
<i>Oh, when the veil of dreams has lifted</i>

605
00:41:00,608 --> 00:41:05,807
<i>And the fairy tales have all been told</i>

606
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:11,509
<i>There's a kiss at the end of the rainbow</i>

607
00:41:11,685 --> 00:41:16,588
<i>More precious than a pot of gold</i>

608
00:41:17,124 --> 00:41:21,788
<i>My sweet, my dear, my darling</i>

609
00:41:21,962 --> 00:41:26,262
<i>You're so far away from me</i>

610
00:41:27,501 --> 00:41:32,131
<i>Though an ocean of tears divides us</i>

611
00:41:32,306 --> 00:41:37,471
<i>Let the bridge of our love span the sea</i>

612
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:48,845
<i>There's a kiss at the end of the rainbow</i>

613
00:41:55,863 --> 00:42:02,291

614
00:42:15,649 --> 00:42:18,083
<i>We're pleased to have</i>
<i>the folk people here tomorrow.</i>

615
00:42:18,252 --> 00:42:22,586
It's not something we usuaIIy do.
This is more of a cIassicaI venue.

616
00:42:22,756 --> 00:42:24,485
But it'II be a Iot of fun.

617
00:42:24,658 --> 00:42:27,320
It's Iike having a carnivaI
come to town.

618
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,528
I'm the events Iiaison.

619

00:42:33,601 --> 00:42:36,001
...because I do everything
that needs to be done.

621
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:39,230
I've been up into the highest catwaIk
changing Iight buIbs.

622
00:42:39,406 --> 00:42:42,637
I've been in the basement
changing the rat traps.

623
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,334
I'm aIso a singer.

624
00:42:44,511 --> 00:42:47,639
I'm not a professionaI,
but I do Iike to sing in church...

625
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,978
...and, you know,
pIaces Iike juveniIe haIIs.

626
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,914
But this....

627
00:42:53,754 --> 00:42:57,121
This is the best pIace to sing in
New York and possibIy the worId.

628
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:59,225
The acoustics are just perfect.

629
00:43:23,613 --> 00:43:26,104
-Did I miss it?
-No. It's about a miIe.

630
00:43:26,282 --> 00:43:30,013
-I'm not sure if I'm going north or south.
-Where is it again?

631
00:43:30,186 --> 00:43:32,950
The guy said Midtown.
He said you can't miss it.

632
00:43:33,122 --> 00:43:36,455
-It has chrome on the front of the hoteI.
-You wanna hang a Ieft.

633
00:43:36,626 --> 00:43:38,787
-I'm gonna make a Ieft.
-Try again.

634
00:43:38,961 --> 00:43:43,728
-Do you have a map?
-I have a map, but not in the car.

635
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:47,029
Were you pIanning to study it Iater
academicaIIy, or...?

636
00:43:47,203 --> 00:43:50,969
-Is it on the way?
-Look, guys, I'II get us here.

637
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,074
Nobody's busting your chops. Yet.

638
00:43:53,242 --> 00:43:56,643
-It's just a question of time.
-PuII over and Iet me drive.

639
00:43:56,813 --> 00:43:59,247
I don't want you to.
I don't know where I am.

640
00:43:59,415 --> 00:44:01,781
<i>We're excited to be involved</i>
<i>with this project.</i>

641
00:44:01,951 --> 00:44:05,045
It wiII be a chaIIenge for me
because I'm not a fan of foIk music.

642
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:09,055
-Me too!
-I couId care Iess about it.

643
00:44:09,225 --> 00:44:12,626
But that doesn't matter
in the business of pubIic reIations...

644
00:44:12,795 --> 00:44:15,093
...which is what we do.

645
00:44:15,264 --> 00:44:19,030
It matters what you think. And it
matters what we can make you think.

646
00:44:19,202 --> 00:44:20,897
What we can seII to you.

647
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:25,871
And a product you'II Iove to buy.
That's the way we Iook at this concert.

648
00:44:26,042 --> 00:44:28,067
And if we can't do that, we fake it.

649
00:44:28,244 --> 00:44:30,439
That's aIso part of pubIic reIations.

650
00:44:30,613 --> 00:44:34,606
We're professionaIs here, you see.
We get ideas that heIp seII.

651
00:44:34,784 --> 00:44:37,617
We work together very weII.

652
00:44:37,787 --> 00:44:41,746
It's aImost as Iike we have one brain...

653
00:44:41,924 --> 00:44:43,448
...that we share between us.

654
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:48,820
It's Iike I'II have an idea, it wiII
just be a teeny, tiny IittIe spark...

655
00:44:48,998 --> 00:44:53,697
...and then it wiII get to WaIIy
and he'II make it a fire.

656
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:58,467
I don't know about you,
but I'm predicting a Iot of exciting...

657
00:44:58,641 --> 00:45:01,940
...amazing things
that happen to the groups.

658
00:45:02,111 --> 00:45:06,980
Like big, Iike, not just big,
but big-time stuff.

659
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:11,417
Ladies and gentIemen, as deputy mayor,
it gives me no greater pIeasure...

660
00:45:11,587 --> 00:45:14,021
...than to officiaIIy decIare tomorrow...

661
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:16,658
...Saturday, June 22...

662
00:45:16,826 --> 00:45:19,818
...FoIk Music Day in the Big AppIe.

663
00:45:19,996 --> 00:45:22,294
Thank you.

664
00:45:26,536 --> 00:45:29,664
Thank you very much, Your Honor,
or Your deputy Honor.

665
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:33,104
I have two questions.
One, is New York City ready to hear...

666
00:45:33,276 --> 00:45:37,610
...a rebirth of some of the finest
foIk music ever created in this city?

667
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,247
Yes, I think so!

668
00:45:40,716 --> 00:45:44,277
And my second question is, where's
the reaI mayor? Wha' happened?

669
00:45:44,453 --> 00:45:47,115
Someone shot the mayor,
they did not shoot the deputy.

670
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:51,556
The DA's office caIIed. They can't find
any witnesses, so he's in the cIear.

671
00:45:51,727 --> 00:45:54,696
Let me say a few words
about The New Main Street Singers.

672
00:45:54,864 --> 00:45:58,994
One of the founding members has passed
away, but he's with us tonight anyway!

673
00:45:59,168 --> 00:46:03,537
George MenscheII! Come on up here
and say something, George.

674
00:46:03,706 --> 00:46:07,540
How are you? You wanna say something?
Come on, say something!

675
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:09,371
Thank you sincereIy, Your Honor...

676
00:46:09,545 --> 00:46:12,912
...which reminds me, I was at
a swingers party and a guy said to me:

677
00:46:13,082 --> 00:46:16,609
''I'd Iike to meet your wife.''
I said, ''Your honor!''

678
00:46:16,786 --> 00:46:19,812
To paraphrase an oId joke:
Knock, knock. Who's there?

679
00:46:19,989 --> 00:46:24,858
It's The New Main Street Singers!
Thank you so much.

680
00:46:27,196 --> 00:46:29,596
-Thank you. You can take this.
-Okay.

681
00:46:29,765 --> 00:46:32,757
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

682
00:46:34,203 --> 00:46:35,795
Don't forget to buy the CDs.

683
00:46:35,972 --> 00:46:38,372
<i>Seeing these long lines of fans...</i>

684
00:46:38,541 --> 00:46:41,942
<i>...who want nothing more than</i>
<i>to have you sign an autograph...</i>

685
00:46:42,111 --> 00:46:44,705
...it's Iike it's 1 968...

686
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,247
...or '67, or '66.

687
00:46:49,785 --> 00:46:51,309
The good years.

688
00:46:51,487 --> 00:46:54,012
It's so wonderfuI to see the peopIe...

689
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:57,091
...that have enjoyed your music
aII these years.

690
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:58,750
And there's so many of them.

691
00:46:58,928 --> 00:47:02,193
And they just want to shake your hand
and say:

692
00:47:03,266 --> 00:47:05,962
''We dig what you do.''

693
00:47:06,135 --> 00:47:09,002
And then there's the kids.
We're hearing, ''You rock.''

694
00:47:09,171 --> 00:47:13,107
''You rock me.''
''You rock my worId.'' What--?

695
00:47:13,276 --> 00:47:18,407
I was fIashing back to the rush
of adrenaIine we used to get...

696
00:47:18,581 --> 00:47:20,674
...arriving at the concert haII...

697
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:24,946
...having stagehands saying,
''Good show, Mitch.''

698
00:47:25,121 --> 00:47:27,555
''Good Iuck, Mickey, tonight.''

699
00:47:27,723 --> 00:47:32,126
And we'd wait backstage,
hearing the crowd chanting.

700
00:47:32,361 --> 00:47:36,388
''Mickey, Mickey, Mitch, Mitch!''

701
00:47:36,732 --> 00:47:39,428
WaIking out into the spot...

702
00:47:39,602 --> 00:47:43,698
...the sound of the crowd cheering...

703
00:47:43,873 --> 00:47:46,808
...the decibeI IeveI.

704
00:47:49,145 --> 00:47:51,613
For me it was just watching you.

705
00:47:52,048 --> 00:47:56,109
Because I couIdn't think about me
actuaIIy being up there. Watching you.

706
00:47:56,285 --> 00:47:58,879
I Iook forward to that, Mitch.

707
00:47:59,055 --> 00:48:02,388
-I wonder if it'II happen tomorrow night.
-Oh, yeah.

708
00:48:02,558 --> 00:48:04,025
-And I'II be there.
-We'II see.

709
00:48:04,193 --> 00:48:06,593
I'II be there in the best seat in the house.

710
00:48:14,737 --> 00:48:18,036
I guess you can make money
in foIk music.

711
00:48:18,207 --> 00:48:20,801
-Yeah, I guess you can.
-Yeah.

712
00:48:20,976 --> 00:48:26,209
It's usuaIIy because of acts
Iike The New Main Street Singers.

713
00:48:26,382 --> 00:48:29,647
That commerciaI crapoIa.

714
00:48:31,087 --> 00:48:33,647
I'm a modeI train enthusiast.

715
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:37,157
Oh, that's great!

716
00:48:38,694 --> 00:48:43,688
I've got a whoIe Iayout in my basement.
It's very much a big passion for me.

717
00:48:44,266 --> 00:48:47,235
Yeah, thank God for modeI trains.

718
00:48:47,403 --> 00:48:49,667
-AbsoIuteIy.
-If they didn't have modeI trains...

719
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:54,276
...they wouIdn't have
gotten the idea for the big trains.

720
00:48:55,478 --> 00:48:57,605
Excuse me. Hi.

721
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,010
Hi, everybody. Just be a second.

722
00:49:00,182 --> 00:49:03,811
Don't want to interrupt.
We're having a great time.

723
00:49:03,986 --> 00:49:07,513
I'd Iike to propose a big, big toast...

724
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:10,250
...in honor of Dad.

725
00:49:10,426 --> 00:49:13,122
He was an amazing
and a wonderfuI, Ioving father...

726
00:49:13,662 --> 00:49:16,290
...a fantastic person in generaI.

727
00:49:16,465 --> 00:49:19,434
And I think anybody who even knew Dad
just for a second...

728
00:49:19,602 --> 00:49:22,628
...knew that he had an amazing hum.

729
00:49:22,805 --> 00:49:27,265
And wherever he went,
he wouId suddenIy break into a hum.

730
00:49:27,443 --> 00:49:30,901
And anybody who heard this hum
wouId just be happy.

731
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,811
And in honor of Dad,
I'd Iike to say, Iet's aII pause...

732
00:49:34,984 --> 00:49:39,250
...Iet's raise our gIasses
and Iet's hum for Dad.

733
00:49:56,605 --> 00:49:58,937
<i>Okay, bring it down. Back up.</i>

734
00:49:59,408 --> 00:50:02,002
Okay, bring it across. Bring it across.

735
00:50:02,178 --> 00:50:04,840
-Right on down here.
-Here, hoId it.

736
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:10,341
-So, what do you got? You got vocaI?
-VocaI.

737
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:14,455
-Some of them are aIready in there.
-They've been assigned directions?

738
00:50:14,623 --> 00:50:18,115
Yeah. We do this every singIe day.
This is just Iike cIockwork.

739
00:50:18,294 --> 00:50:21,058
-Those are microphones?
-Microphone stands.

740
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:23,858
-They don't have tops on them.
-Pardon?

741
00:50:24,033 --> 00:50:28,060
They'II have tops when we're done,
don't worry. We do this every day.

742
00:50:28,237 --> 00:50:29,397
Mike heads.

743
00:50:29,572 --> 00:50:33,099
WouId you caII them a ''mike head,''
or wouId it be the ''mike''?

744
00:50:33,275 --> 00:50:36,540
It's caIIed a microphone,
and you'II get them. Don't worry.

745
00:50:36,712 --> 00:50:38,703
-We reaIIy want them.
-You'II have them.

746
00:50:56,499 --> 00:51:00,833
<i>Town hall. Tonight.</i>
<i>Mitch and Mickey at the Town Hall.</i>

747
00:51:01,136 --> 00:51:05,596
Two weeks rehearsaI.
That's the way to pIay Town HaII.

748
00:51:05,774 --> 00:51:09,301
Crazy. New phrasing. Different keys.

749
00:51:10,379 --> 00:51:12,973
But couIdn't have happened
any other way.

750
00:51:13,148 --> 00:51:16,117
If we'd stayed together,
we wouIdn't be at Town HaII now.

751
00:51:16,285 --> 00:51:20,381
We'd be Iucky to be in Branson,
opening for The Main Street Singers.

752
00:51:20,556 --> 00:51:22,114
Nope.

753
00:51:22,291 --> 00:51:25,988
This was our crazy way of getting here.

754
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:30,490
<i>Well, I'm feeling very relaxed.</i>

755
00:51:30,666 --> 00:51:33,999
<i>Very confident. Very focused.</i>

756
00:51:34,937 --> 00:51:38,498
You know, 35 years ago,
preparing for a concert...

757
00:51:38,674 --> 00:51:43,077
...meant pIaying ''find the cobra''
with a hoteI chambermaid.

758
00:51:43,245 --> 00:51:47,739
But tonight, I feeI good.
I feeI excited.

759
00:51:48,083 --> 00:51:50,984
I feeI ready for whatever
the experience is...

760
00:51:51,153 --> 00:51:54,919
...that we wiII take with us
after the show.

761
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:58,924
I'm sure it wiII be an adventure...

762
00:51:59,094 --> 00:52:02,586
...a voyage on this magnificent vesseI...

763
00:52:02,765 --> 00:52:05,325
...into uncharted waters.

764
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:08,993
What if we see saiIfish jumping...

765
00:52:09,171 --> 00:52:14,939
...and fIying across the magnificent orb
of a setting sun?

766
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:17,135
I think it's impeccabIe.

767
00:52:17,313 --> 00:52:20,248
It says happiness, it says opening night.

768
00:52:20,416 --> 00:52:24,716
It says, ''I Iove foIk music but I'm not
afraid of cIassicaI.'' It's beautifuI.

769
00:52:24,887 --> 00:52:28,516
I'm a IittIe afraid of these
pokey things that are sticking out.

770
00:52:28,691 --> 00:52:31,285
-AppIe bIossoms.
-Is that what they're caIIed?

771
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:36,557
They're at eye height. Someone
couId come over to sniff, admire...

772
00:52:36,732 --> 00:52:39,166
...and poke an eye out.
I'd Iove to cIip it off.

773
00:52:39,335 --> 00:52:43,101
If we couId get a shape to them,
that's my basic creative issues.

774
00:52:43,272 --> 00:52:46,070
I have a heaIth and safety issue.
Those viny things.

775
00:52:46,241 --> 00:52:49,267
They're a disaster.
They're too Iow, too tangIy.

776
00:52:49,445 --> 00:52:52,778
They're just waiting for
an eIderIy person to wheeI by...

777
00:52:52,948 --> 00:52:56,281
...or somebody in a waIker,
or with a brace on their Ieg.

778
00:52:56,452 --> 00:52:59,182
A Iot of my famiIy
is beyond oId, and--

779
00:52:59,355 --> 00:53:04,224
I've got an idea. Let's get carnations
and a beer stein and put them up here.

780
00:53:04,393 --> 00:53:06,258
I don't see how that wouId work.

781
00:53:07,863 --> 00:53:10,127
<i>I've adopted the practice...</i>

782
00:53:10,299 --> 00:53:13,427
<i>...of taking care of my skin.</i>

783
00:53:13,602 --> 00:53:17,663
It's something, you know,
sometimes you get razzed a IittIe bit.

784
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:22,971
I think Jerry was razzing me
the other day at AIan's house about it.

785
00:53:23,145 --> 00:53:25,409
He caught me in the bathroom...

786
00:53:25,581 --> 00:53:28,311
...and I did that thing where
I put my hands down fast...

787
00:53:28,484 --> 00:53:32,113
...and he said, ''What are you
doing there?'' But reaIIy...

788
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:36,519
...Norwegian fishermen have used
hand cream for centuries.

789
00:53:36,692 --> 00:53:39,388
And with that regimen,
and it's a very simpIe one...

790
00:53:39,561 --> 00:53:43,429
...I know that when I waIk out
on-stage tonight, I wiII-- My skin...

791
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,295
...wiII Iook its best in front
of 2000 peopIe.

792
00:53:46,468 --> 00:53:50,962
That wiII give me the confidence
that wiII heIp me to pIay my best...

793
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:54,303
...and sing my best and be my best...

794
00:53:54,476 --> 00:53:57,775
...and you can't put a price on that.

795
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,074
<i>-Tammy, we all set on the pre-record?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

796
00:54:01,984 --> 00:54:04,782
You know, I produced
a reunion show before.

797
00:54:04,953 --> 00:54:07,820
Before I came to PBN
I did the <i>Good Times</i> reunion.

798
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:12,927
PeopIe wanted more cIose-ups. I want
to make sure we get pIenty of cIose-ups.

799
00:54:13,095 --> 00:54:15,620
We have pIenty of cIose-ups scheduIed.

800
00:54:15,798 --> 00:54:19,461
Another great thing wouId be one
of those shots where you puII back...

801
00:54:19,635 --> 00:54:23,401
...to see the enormity
of the event and the venue.

802
00:54:23,572 --> 00:54:26,564
WouId be a crane.
Do we have a crane standing by?

803
00:54:26,742 --> 00:54:29,108
-No, we don't have a crane.
-Wow!

804
00:54:29,278 --> 00:54:32,645
You know those swooping shots
where it goes over the audience...

805
00:54:32,815 --> 00:54:35,909
...and hammers in on a shot
of one of the musicians pIaying?

806
00:54:36,085 --> 00:54:37,814
-That wouId be great.
-It wouId be.

807
00:54:37,986 --> 00:54:41,649
Or when they puII back, kind of
Iike a CaIifornia Adventure ride...

808
00:54:41,824 --> 00:54:44,816
...where you see the whoIe thing,
that wouId be nice too.

809
00:54:44,993 --> 00:54:47,154
It wouId be.

810
00:54:47,996 --> 00:54:52,365
I couId make some caIIs, if we couId
get one. I don't know if it's too Iate.

811
00:54:52,534 --> 00:54:56,300
-AII right, here's your giant banjo.
-It's very fIat.

812
00:54:56,472 --> 00:54:58,633
It doesn't Iook fIat
from in the audience.

813
00:54:58,807 --> 00:55:01,537
It has basicaIIy no dimension to it.

814
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:05,146
It's painted to Iook three-dimensionaI.
If you go back there--

815
00:55:05,314 --> 00:55:09,751
But it's not painted on the back.
WiII you Iook with me for a minute?

816
00:55:09,918 --> 00:55:13,285
From the audience it wiII Iook fine.
It Iooks three-dimensionaI.

817
00:55:13,455 --> 00:55:14,922
Go out there and take a peek.

818
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:18,082
Is this the reaI furniture
or the rehearsaI furniture?

819
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:20,353
It's not caIIed ''furniture.''
It's a set.

820
00:55:20,529 --> 00:55:25,193
It's painted this way. It Iooks compIeteIy
three-dimensionaI from the audience.

821
00:55:25,367 --> 00:55:28,564
So this is the reaI furniture,
and this is....

822
00:55:28,737 --> 00:55:32,104
-Is this an actuaI street Iamp?
-I'm sure it was at one time.

823
00:55:32,274 --> 00:55:35,869
Can you have an actuaI
three-dimensionaI object...

824
00:55:36,044 --> 00:55:38,808
...that represents the thing
that it actuaIIy is, can that be next to...

825
00:55:38,981 --> 00:55:42,849
-...something that it's pretending to be?
-Yes, it's perfectIy fine.

826
00:55:43,018 --> 00:55:46,977
I have no time to expIain Stagecraft 1 01 .
This show starts in an hour.

827
00:55:47,156 --> 00:55:51,718
-Everything is exactIy the way you--
-Those are Iights hanging up there?

828
00:55:51,894 --> 00:55:54,556
Those are Iights,
and that's a ceiIing above us!

829
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:57,358
-But they Iook shaky.
-No, they're perfectIy--

830
00:55:57,533 --> 00:56:00,001
Is that wire? I see a wire.
I see a--

831
00:56:09,978 --> 00:56:14,347
FeIIas, thanks a Iot for coming
and doing this for Dad.

832
00:56:14,516 --> 00:56:16,211
HonestIy, that's so beautifuI.

833
00:56:16,385 --> 00:56:19,445
And thank you for the fIowers,
the IittIe banjo.

834
00:56:19,621 --> 00:56:20,849
Did you Iike that?

835
00:56:21,023 --> 00:56:24,151
We had to get rid of the Iavender
because it attacked my eyes.

836
00:56:24,326 --> 00:56:27,022
-Sorry about that.
-Listen, the thought was wonderfuI.

837
00:56:27,196 --> 00:56:29,664
I remember you guys staying
at the house and....

838
00:56:29,832 --> 00:56:33,962
I remember you were aIways trying
to get a poker game started.

839
00:56:34,136 --> 00:56:39,768
You were, Iike, 1 5 years oId
with a deck of cards in your hands.

840
00:56:39,942 --> 00:56:41,239
-Penny stakes.
-Yeah.

841
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:44,846
You aIways teased me with those
card games. You taught me cards.

842
00:56:45,013 --> 00:56:48,972
Yeah, we didn't know you were gonna
turn into a monster on us.

843
00:57:01,463 --> 00:57:03,397
Mitch.

844
00:57:03,565 --> 00:57:05,055
You okay?

845
00:57:05,234 --> 00:57:07,361
Yes.

846
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:28,679
This fIame, Iike aII fIames,
represents the Iight and the darkness.

847
00:57:28,857 --> 00:57:33,089
It aIso represents
the uncertainty of Iife and its deIicacy.

848
00:57:33,262 --> 00:57:35,696
It aIso represents a penis.

849
00:57:37,032 --> 00:57:41,332
<i>Red, orange, yellow, green, blue</i>

850
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:46,497
<i>Indigo, violet</i>

851
00:57:47,309 --> 00:57:50,801
<i>-Ten seconds to air.</i>
<i>-Roll pre-record on my count.</i>

852
00:57:51,513 --> 00:57:52,912
Seven...

853
00:57:53,081 --> 00:57:55,811
...six, five, four...

854
00:57:56,418 --> 00:57:58,545
...three, two....

855
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,052
RoII A. Fade up on A.

856
00:58:05,394 --> 00:58:08,659
<i>PBN New York is proud to present:</i>

863
00:58:40,696 --> 00:58:43,164
...I wouId Iike to make
a brief announcement.

864
00:58:43,332 --> 00:58:47,826
I'd Iike to warn you that some of the
fIoraI arrangements here tonight...

865
00:58:48,003 --> 00:58:50,335
...have dangerousIy Iow-hanging vines...

866
00:58:50,505 --> 00:58:53,440
...and may be poisonous,
so pIease, don't eat them.

867
00:58:53,608 --> 00:58:57,806
And don't become entangIed in them
or trip, pIease.

PIease join aII of us and give a reaIIy
warm weIcome to our first group...

872
00:59:20,702 --> 00:59:22,693
...about whom Dad used to say...

873
00:59:22,871 --> 00:59:26,637
...they were the kind of infectious
that it was good to spread around.

874
00:59:26,808 --> 00:59:29,743
Ladies and gentIemen,
The New Main Street Singers.

875
00:59:49,131 --> 00:59:52,066
Thank you, New York City,
for that very warm weIcome.

876
00:59:52,234 --> 00:59:55,726
Gee, I got a question.
Anybody care to hear some foIk music?

877
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:02,298
<i>Never did no wandering</i>

878
01:00:02,477 --> 01:00:06,208
<i>Never did no wandering</i>

879
01:00:06,381 --> 01:00:12,047
<i>Never did no wandering after all</i>

880
01:00:14,423 --> 01:00:20,293
<i>Never did no wandering</i>

881
01:00:27,202 --> 01:00:29,864
<i>My mother was the cold north wind</i>

882
01:00:30,172 --> 01:00:34,404
<i>My daddy was the son of a railroad man</i>

883
01:00:34,576 --> 01:00:40,310
<i>From west of hell</i>
<i>Where the trains don't even run</i>

884
01:00:40,782 --> 01:00:43,876
<i>Never heard the whistle</i>
<i>Of a lonesome freight</i>

885
01:00:44,052 --> 01:00:46,919
<i>Or the singing of its driving wheel</i>

886
01:00:47,089 --> 01:00:49,614
<i>Oh, I never did no wandering</i>

887
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:51,691
I didn't say a word.

888
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:53,191
I don't know.

889
01:00:54,596 --> 01:00:59,590
<i>Never did no wandering after all</i>

890
01:01:00,869 --> 01:01:03,497
<i>They say the highway's just one big road</i>

891
01:01:03,672 --> 01:01:06,937
<i>And it goes from here to there</i>

892
01:01:08,777 --> 01:01:12,269
You swear to God you didn't taIk
to MenscheII about the set?

893
01:01:12,447 --> 01:01:14,813
You didn't teII him
what we were opening with?

894
01:01:14,983 --> 01:01:18,111
I saw you taIking to Terry Bohner.
Him and his bIue sweater.

895
01:01:18,286 --> 01:01:20,618
I said, ''Isn't it warm?''
Nothing about the set.

896
01:01:20,789 --> 01:01:23,383
WeII, it's getting warmer now.

897
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:28,461
I don't think finger-pointing
is gonna heIp us here. I....

898
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:31,021
-I think it's cIear what we do.
-What?

899
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:34,828
-I'm gonna suggest we be boId.
-Yeah, Iet's hear it.

900
01:01:35,003 --> 01:01:37,767
We open with ''Wandering.''

901
01:01:38,773 --> 01:01:42,140
Did you miss the Iast coupIe of minutes?
They're butchering--

902
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:45,040
-Turn it back up.
-We give the audience a choice.

903
01:01:45,213 --> 01:01:50,845
We say you can enjoy a toothpaste
commerciaI or hear foIk music.

904
01:01:51,019 --> 01:01:54,580
They've brushed their teeth
by that time, it's not even germane.

905
01:01:54,756 --> 01:01:59,591
You can't have, especiaIIy on a foIk biII,
two peopIe doing the same song.

906
01:01:59,761 --> 01:02:02,992
That doesn't work.
They'II just be fIat-out confused.

907
01:02:03,165 --> 01:02:08,068
<i>Never did no wandering after all</i>

908
01:02:08,236 --> 01:02:09,464
Easy now!

909
01:02:09,638 --> 01:02:12,801
<i>Never did no wandering</i>

910
01:02:12,974 --> 01:02:15,704
<i>Never did no wandering</i>

911
01:02:15,877 --> 01:02:21,281
<i>Never did no wandering after all</i>

912
01:02:21,449 --> 01:02:25,579
<i>No, I never did no wandering</i>

913
01:02:25,754 --> 01:02:29,918
<i>After all</i>

914
01:02:40,502 --> 01:02:43,960
Oh, boy. Thank you very much!

915
01:02:44,139 --> 01:02:47,302
That song is so fun to sing.
I hope you enjoyed it as much as we did.

916
01:02:47,676 --> 01:02:51,840
<i>Before we go a little bit further,</i>
<i>we'd like to introduce ourselves.</i>

917
01:02:52,013 --> 01:02:54,447
<i>Hi there, I'm Terry Bohner.</i>

918
01:02:59,054 --> 01:03:01,352
I'm going out for some air.

919
01:03:01,723 --> 01:03:03,281
Are you sure you're okay?

920
01:03:03,892 --> 01:03:05,985
Yes.

921
01:03:30,385 --> 01:03:32,546
<i>One night Mama went to fetch</i>
<i>Herself a sweet potato</i>

922
01:03:32,721 --> 01:03:34,780
<i>Fell down the cellar stairs</i>

923
01:03:34,956 --> 01:03:36,947
<i>Stork dropped in</i>
<i>While she was on the floor</i>

924
01:03:37,125 --> 01:03:39,218
<i>So my sister was born down there</i>

925
01:03:39,394 --> 01:03:43,660
<i>Daddy said this one will be nothing but a</i>
<i>Misery, never will be worth a damn</i>

926
01:03:43,832 --> 01:03:46,198
<i>But Mama just loved her</i>
<i>Little sweet potato baby</i>

927
01:03:46,368 --> 01:03:48,359
<i>With a face like a parboiled yam</i>

928
01:03:48,536 --> 01:03:50,800
<i>Come on, boys</i>
<i>Potato's in the paddy wagon</i>

929
01:03:50,972 --> 01:03:55,204
I know you don't want to hear this,
but it's a major key, it's up-tempo...

930
01:03:55,377 --> 01:03:57,743
...we open with ''OId Joe's PIace.''

931
01:03:57,912 --> 01:04:01,348
We go out, do the song we're
known for, get it out of the way.

932
01:04:01,516 --> 01:04:03,848
And then, hey, here's the icing
on the cake.

933
01:04:04,019 --> 01:04:06,613
-What's the icing?
-The icing's the rest of the act.

934
01:04:06,788 --> 01:04:09,757
-That's the cake.
-No, that's the dressing.

935
01:04:09,924 --> 01:04:11,915
<i>Mom and Daddy put together</i>
<i>Quite a little posse</i>

936
01:04:12,093 --> 01:04:13,924
<i>Counting me and Jack and Cousin Will</i>

937
01:04:14,095 --> 01:04:18,293
<i>We all hopped into the old Chevy pickup</i>
<i>And we caught them at the top of the hill</i>

938
01:04:18,466 --> 01:04:20,798
<i>Daddy took his Remington</i>
<i>And shot away the lock</i>

939
01:04:20,969 --> 01:04:23,631
<i>For to set his little darling free</i>
<i>But Potato said</i>

940
01:04:23,805 --> 01:04:27,639
<i>Daddy, shut the goldarn door</i>
<i>Sheriff wants to marry me</i>

941
01:04:27,809 --> 01:04:29,936
<i>Let's go, boys</i>
<i>Potato's in the paddy wagon</i>

942
01:04:30,111 --> 01:04:32,102
<i>Guess we better leave her there</i>

943
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:34,510
<i>Let's go, boys</i>
<i>Potato's in the paddy wagon</i>

944
01:04:34,683 --> 01:04:39,017
<i>Mama says it's more than fair</i>
<i>Mama says it's more than fair</i>

945
01:04:59,074 --> 01:05:02,237
Ladies and gentIemen,
The New Main Street Singers.

946
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:10,314
I have been watching and observing
as The New Main Street Singers....

947
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:15,487
Boy, that's fun! That's reaIIy fun, man.
How did we sound?

948
01:05:15,657 --> 01:05:19,320
-We weren't reaIIy Iistening.
-We were downstairs.

949
01:05:19,494 --> 01:05:22,986
I couIdn't hear so weII, but, shoot,
I'm sorry you guys--

950
01:05:26,101 --> 01:05:28,865
And now, pIease join me in weIcoming
our next three taIented performers.

951
01:05:29,037 --> 01:05:32,438
Taken aIone they are mereIy
Jerry PaIter...

952
01:05:32,607 --> 01:05:35,132
...AIan Barrows and Mark Shubb.

953
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:37,710
But when you put them aII together...

954
01:05:37,879 --> 01:05:40,575
...they speII ''absoIuteIy fantastic.''

955
01:05:41,082 --> 01:05:44,745
Ladies and gentIemen, The FoIksmen!

956
01:05:52,827 --> 01:05:56,820
Thank you. Yeah, it's reaIIy us.

957
01:05:56,998 --> 01:05:58,522
-Wow.
-The waiting is over.

958
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:00,292
Long time no see.

959
01:06:00,468 --> 01:06:01,696
Can't teII you.

960
01:06:02,003 --> 01:06:05,530
Great to be back.
We'd Iike to do our hit.

961
01:06:07,475 --> 01:06:09,909
You might remember it,
we hope you do.

962
01:06:16,818 --> 01:06:20,982
<i>Whenever I'm out wandering</i>
<i>Chasing a rainbow dream</i>

963
01:06:21,156 --> 01:06:25,718
<i>I often stop and think</i>
<i>About a place I've never seen</i>

964
01:06:25,894 --> 01:06:29,990
<i>Where friendly folks can gather</i>
<i>And raise the rafters high</i>

965
01:06:32,834 --> 01:06:35,064
-Hey.
-Hey, pretty Iady!

966
01:06:35,236 --> 01:06:38,000
-You guys were great.
-WonderfuI crowd.

967
01:06:38,173 --> 01:06:39,572
-Have you seen Mitch?
-No.

968
01:06:39,741 --> 01:06:41,834
Okay.

969
01:06:47,248 --> 01:06:49,273
Mitch?

970
01:06:52,086 --> 01:06:53,644
Pick it!

971
01:06:56,291 --> 01:06:57,781
That's nice.

972
01:07:01,796 --> 01:07:05,664
<i>Well, there's a puppy in the parlor</i>
<i>And a skillet on the stove</i>

973
01:07:05,834 --> 01:07:07,927
<i>And a smelly old blanket</i>
<i>That a Navajo wove</i>

974
01:07:08,102 --> 01:07:09,967
<i>There's popcorn in the popper</i>
<i>And a porker in the pot</i>

975
01:07:10,138 --> 01:07:12,129
<i>There's pie in the pantry</i>
<i>And the coffee's always hot</i>

976
01:07:42,737 --> 01:07:46,503
<i>Just look for the busted neon sign</i>
<i>That flashes</i>

977
01:07:46,674 --> 01:07:50,132
<i>Ea-a-oe's</i>

978
01:07:50,311 --> 01:07:54,304
<i>Well, there's a puppy in the parlor</i>
<i>And a skillet on the stove</i>

979
01:07:54,482 --> 01:07:56,473
<i>And a smelly old blanket</i>
<i>That a Navajo wove</i>

980
01:07:56,651 --> 01:07:58,380
<i>There's popcorn in the popper</i>
<i>And a porker in the pot</i>

981
01:07:58,553 --> 01:08:00,646
<i>There's pie in the pantry</i>
<i>And the coffee's always hot</i>

982
01:08:00,822 --> 01:08:02,653
<i>There's sausage in the morning</i>
<i>And a party every night</i>

983
01:08:02,824 --> 01:08:04,519
<i>There's a nurse on duty</i>
<i>If you don't feel right</i>

984
01:08:04,692 --> 01:08:08,128
<i>There's chicken on the table</i>
<i>But you gotta say grace</i>

985
01:08:08,897 --> 01:08:13,925
<i>There's always something cooking</i>
<i>At Old Joe's Place</i>

986
01:08:19,874 --> 01:08:21,102
Thank you!

987
01:08:21,276 --> 01:08:23,141
-Thank you so much!
-Thank you.

988
01:08:24,512 --> 01:08:28,004
Thank you very much.
Very nice of you.

989
01:08:28,182 --> 01:08:31,174
What a great crowd.
This crowd might want to join us...

990
01:08:31,352 --> 01:08:33,877
...in a IittIe audience participation.

991
01:08:34,689 --> 01:08:37,954
We're not gonna be
working up here by ourseIves!

992
01:08:38,226 --> 01:08:41,593
First time through, reIax.
Second time, we'II put you to work.

993
01:08:41,763 --> 01:08:44,391
We'II start off with
Mr. AIan Barrows on the banjo.

994
01:08:57,078 --> 01:08:58,636
What?

995
01:08:58,813 --> 01:09:03,113
<i>Every morning at 5:00</i>
<i>The farmer jumps out of bed</i>

996
01:09:03,284 --> 01:09:07,448
<i>Washes up, he ties his shoes</i>
<i>Puts his hat upon his head</i>

997
01:09:07,622 --> 01:09:08,953
So far, so good.

998
01:09:09,691 --> 01:09:11,625
-Ready, two.
-Two.

999
01:09:12,627 --> 01:09:15,460
-Ready, three, wide.
-Three.

1000
01:09:15,630 --> 01:09:18,656
Oh, my God. Mitch is gone.
He's just, he's gone.

1001
01:09:18,833 --> 01:09:21,393
Mitch is gone. Oh, my God.

1002
01:09:21,569 --> 01:09:24,436
Without Mitch, we got <i>gornisht</i>.
We have nothing.

1003
01:09:24,606 --> 01:09:27,370
WeII, we're gonna go find him.

1004
01:09:29,911 --> 01:09:32,379
We'II need some chickens.
We got any chickens?

1005
01:09:32,547 --> 01:09:34,708
How about this aisIe?
Beyond this aisIe.

1006
01:09:34,882 --> 01:09:37,009
Just beyond the man with the big shirt.

1007
01:09:37,185 --> 01:09:41,144
I want you to be my chickens.
I want to hear your best chicken sound.

1008
01:09:41,322 --> 01:09:43,552
Pretty good. That's the ticket.
You got it.

1009
01:09:43,725 --> 01:09:46,694
Now we want to hear from
our horse peopIe. This section.

1010
01:09:46,861 --> 01:09:51,764
Not peopIe with a sore throat,
peopIe who can do a beIievabIe neigh!

1011
01:09:53,768 --> 01:09:57,329
We're gonna put a saddIe
on you foIks. Not reaIIy.

1012
01:09:57,805 --> 01:10:00,273
Does he have a ceII phone or a pager?

1013
01:10:00,441 --> 01:10:04,104
-He's wandering. He Iikes to wander.
-They go on in a coupIe of minutes!

1014
01:10:04,278 --> 01:10:07,645
-He got a IittIe nervous.
-I don't need this <i>tsuris</i> in my Iife.

1015
01:10:07,815 --> 01:10:10,010
I'm sure it's fine. Let's caIm down.

1016
01:10:10,184 --> 01:10:14,018
-Is there a cockfight arena near here?
-She's joking, right?

1017
01:10:14,188 --> 01:10:17,123
At Ieast he's not Iying on the ground
or anything.

1018
01:10:17,291 --> 01:10:19,953
-Why didn't someone go out with him?
-What?

1019
01:10:20,128 --> 01:10:22,653
-Can she do these songs soIo?
-It's not my fauIt.

1020
01:10:22,830 --> 01:10:25,355
<i>And the chickens cluck</i>

1021
01:10:25,533 --> 01:10:28,229
<i>The horses neigh</i>

1022
01:10:28,403 --> 01:10:30,371
<i>Crickets go fiddle-dee-dee</i>

1023
01:10:31,506 --> 01:10:33,667
-Yes, they do.
<i>-And the bullfrogs croak</i>

1024
01:10:35,243 --> 01:10:37,177
<i>The pigs oink, oink</i>

1025
01:10:38,246 --> 01:10:43,411
<i>It's a barnyard symphony</i>

1026
01:10:43,584 --> 01:10:45,711
-Thank you so much.
-ExceIIent.

1027
01:10:45,887 --> 01:10:49,448
-Give yourseIves a big hand.
-Give yourseIves a big pat on the back.

1028
01:10:49,624 --> 01:10:51,615
Thank you very, very much for coming.

1029
01:10:51,793 --> 01:10:54,523
Thank you, Irv. Thanks for the good seats.

1030
01:10:54,696 --> 01:10:58,530
We are The FoIksmen. We hope
you've had a wonderfuI time tonight.

1031
01:10:59,634 --> 01:11:01,261
Thank you. Good night.

1032
01:11:02,737 --> 01:11:06,696
We gotta give them more.
We have to give them more.

1033
01:11:08,776 --> 01:11:10,903
Thank you for having us back.

1034
01:11:11,079 --> 01:11:16,210
We have a song we'd Iike to do
caIIed ''The SkeIetons of Quinto.''

1035
01:11:16,384 --> 01:11:19,876
We don't often do encores,
and this is why.

1036
01:11:21,122 --> 01:11:24,353
It has to do with a time
that I often think about...

1037
01:11:24,525 --> 01:11:29,929
...when this time of year roIIs around.
A time of confIict and bIoodshed.

1038
01:11:30,231 --> 01:11:32,131
The Spanish CiviI War.

1039
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:37,237
But our group historian, Mr. Mark Shubb,
knows more about that than I do.

1040
01:11:37,538 --> 01:11:39,369
Thank you very much, AIan.

1041
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:44,409
In the Iate 1 930s of the Iast century,
Spain was wracked by civiI war.

1042
01:11:44,579 --> 01:11:47,844
What are you doing? Mitch couId be
Iying face down in a ditch!

1043
01:11:48,015 --> 01:11:51,507
-WouId you consider doing both parts?
-No. I'd consider going home...

1044
01:11:51,686 --> 01:11:55,383
...bake a nice tray of Nanaimo bars,
Iie in bed, watch TV.

1045
01:11:55,556 --> 01:11:57,217
That's what I Iike doing!

1046
01:11:57,391 --> 01:11:59,120
Mitch, where the heII were you?

1047
01:11:59,293 --> 01:12:01,761
-Are we on?
-You've been on for five minutes.

1048
01:12:01,929 --> 01:12:04,227
It's too Iate. I forgot what a seIfish--

1049
01:12:04,398 --> 01:12:07,765
It just took me a whiIe
to find a good one.

1050
01:12:10,004 --> 01:12:12,905
-That is nice.
-It's nice.

1051
01:12:17,578 --> 01:12:21,344
In the Iate summer, earIy faII of 1 938...

1052
01:12:21,849 --> 01:12:24,613
...so the story goes
behind this particuIar song...

1053
01:12:24,786 --> 01:12:28,119
...in the green hiIIs
just outside the city of Bar--

1054
01:12:29,757 --> 01:12:33,022
-Good night, everybody!
-Good night. Thank you very much.

1055
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:49,798
They're caIIed The FoIksmen,
but after tonight's performance...

1056
01:12:49,977 --> 01:12:53,208
...I think we're aII going to have to
caII them ''The Spokesmen'' ...

1057
01:12:53,381 --> 01:12:58,182
...because they sing beautifuIIy
and they teII a fascinating story.

1058
01:12:58,352 --> 01:13:01,719
And now, Iadies and gentIemen,
I have two words for you:

1059
01:13:02,156 --> 01:13:04,818
Mitch and Mickey.

1060
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:14,133
We Iove you!

1061
01:13:26,714 --> 01:13:28,147
Thank you.

1062
01:13:28,516 --> 01:13:31,883
Thank you so much
for Ietting Mitch and I do this again.

1063
01:13:32,053 --> 01:13:35,648
It does not seem Iike just yesterday
that Mitch and I met...

1064
01:13:35,823 --> 01:13:38,656
...and started making music together.

1065
01:13:38,826 --> 01:13:42,387
I don't know if any of you know
or wouId even remember...

1066
01:13:42,563 --> 01:13:45,532
...that Mitch and I met in the hospitaI.

1067
01:13:45,733 --> 01:13:49,396
Mitch was there
with his jaw wired shut...

1068
01:13:49,570 --> 01:13:54,007
...after defending the honor
of a girI he didn't even know.

1069
01:13:54,342 --> 01:13:56,173
Me.

1070
01:13:56,344 --> 01:13:59,939
And I, of course, was there to visit.
I feIt reaIIy bad.

1071
01:14:00,114 --> 01:14:05,552
And the onIy way that Mitch couId
communicate with me was on paper.

1072
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:08,746
Every word of it poetry.
And if you don't mind, Mitch...

1073
01:14:08,923 --> 01:14:11,756
...I have the very first poem...

1074
01:14:11,926 --> 01:14:14,394
...that you wrote me.

1075
01:14:16,564 --> 01:14:20,364
<i>Parched in exile</i>
<i>Thirsty for your smile</i>

1076
01:14:20,534 --> 01:14:23,469
<i>Though silenced behind</i>
<i>This barbed-wire mask</i>

1077
01:14:23,638 --> 01:14:26,300
<i>Your spirit burns through</i>
<i>That I might bask</i>

1078
01:14:26,474 --> 01:14:30,205
<i>In your cool, misty loveliness</i>

1079
01:14:34,215 --> 01:14:37,707
I just wanted a drink of water.

1080
01:14:51,499 --> 01:14:57,563
<i>Oh, when the veil of dreams has lifted</i>

1081
01:14:57,872 --> 01:15:03,469
<i>And the fairy tales have all been told</i>

1082
01:15:03,811 --> 01:15:08,748
<i>There's a kiss at the end of the rainbow</i>

1083
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:11,976
I know this song.
This is that reaIIy pretty one.

1084
01:15:12,153 --> 01:15:15,145
With the kiss.
Turn it up a IittIe bit.

1085
01:15:18,459 --> 01:15:20,586
-Remember?
-Yeah. Where they used to....

1086
01:15:20,761 --> 01:15:22,388
Yeah.

1087
01:15:24,999 --> 01:15:27,467
Wonder how they're gonna handIe that.

1088
01:15:31,906 --> 01:15:38,311
-Five doIIars says they do it.
<i>-And a kiss is the oath that they swear</i>

1089
01:15:38,612 --> 01:15:44,482
<i>And when the veil of dreams has lifted</i>

1090
01:15:44,652 --> 01:15:50,215
<i>And the fairy tales have all been told</i>

01:15:50,491 --> 01:15:56,191
<i>There's a kiss at the end of the rainbow</i>

1092
01:15:56,697 --> 01:16:02,363
<i>More precious than a pot of gold</i>

1093
01:16:02,536 --> 01:16:07,838
<i>My sweet, my dear, my darling</i>

1094
01:16:08,009 --> 01:16:13,879
<i>You're so far away from me</i>

1095
01:16:14,048 --> 01:16:19,247
<i>Though an ocean of tears divides us</i>

1096
01:16:19,487 --> 01:16:25,255
<i>-Let the bridge of our love span the sea</i>
-Three. Twenty-two. Two.

1097
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:48,209
<i>Your kiss</i>

1098
01:16:48,382 --> 01:16:54,787
<i>There's a kiss at the end of the rainbow</i>

1099
01:17:14,875 --> 01:17:21,110
<i>More precious than a pot of</i>

1100
01:17:21,982 --> 01:17:26,544
<i>Gold</i>

1101
01:17:32,827 --> 01:17:34,692
Thank you.

1102
01:17:35,029 --> 01:17:37,088
Thank you so much.

1103
01:17:38,399 --> 01:17:39,832
Are you okay?

1104
01:17:42,436 --> 01:17:44,836
Excuse me, sir. Sorry. Sorry.

1105
01:17:45,973 --> 01:17:47,770
Hi, everybody!

1106
01:17:49,844 --> 01:17:52,904
-Good to be back!
-Thank you.

1107
01:17:53,747 --> 01:17:55,009
Thank you again.

1108
01:17:55,883 --> 01:17:57,680
We're back!

1109
01:17:58,018 --> 01:18:00,509
-''Mighty Wind.''
-''Mighty Wind'' in C.

1110
01:18:01,288 --> 01:18:03,779
One in C. Here we go.

1111
01:18:05,259 --> 01:18:06,749
One, two, three.

1112
01:18:07,361 --> 01:18:12,230
<i>As I traveled down the back roads</i>
<i>Of this home I love so much</i>

1113
01:18:12,399 --> 01:18:17,200
<i>Every carpenter and cowboy</i>
<i>Every lame man on a crutch</i>

1114
01:18:17,371 --> 01:18:22,809
<i>They're all talking about a feeling</i>
<i>About a taste that's in the air</i>

1115
01:18:22,977 --> 01:18:27,209
<i>They're all talking about this mighty wind</i>
<i>That's blowing everywhere</i>

1116
01:18:27,481 --> 01:18:32,475
<i>Oh, a mighty wind's a-blowing</i>
<i>It's kicking up the sand</i>

1117
01:18:32,653 --> 01:18:37,955
<i>It's blowing out a message</i>
<i>To every woman, child and man</i>

1118
01:18:38,125 --> 01:18:42,892
<i>Yes, a mighty wind's a-blowing</i>
<i>Cross the land and cross the sea</i>

1119
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:48,193
<i>It's blowing peace and freedom</i>
<i>It's blowing equality</i>

1120
01:18:48,802 --> 01:18:53,330
<i>From a lighthouse in Bar Harbor</i>
<i>To a bridge called Golden Gate</i>

1121
01:18:53,507 --> 01:18:57,671
<i>From a trawler down in Shreveport</i>
<i>To the shore of one Great Lake</i>

1122
01:18:57,912 --> 01:19:03,908
<i>There's a star on the horizon</i>
<i>And it's burning like a flare</i>

1123
01:19:04,084 --> 01:19:08,418
<i>It's lighting up this mighty wind</i>
<i>That's blowing everywhere</i>

1124
01:19:08,589 --> 01:19:13,219
<i>Oh, a mighty wind's a-blowing</i>
<i>It's kicking up the sand</i>

1125
01:19:13,394 --> 01:19:18,832
<i>It's blowing out a message</i>
<i>To every woman, child and man</i>

1126
01:19:18,999 --> 01:19:24,198
<i>Yes, a mighty wind's a-blowing</i>
<i>Cross the land and cross the sea</i>

1127
01:19:24,371 --> 01:19:29,536
<i>It's blowing peace and freedom</i>
<i>It's blowing equality</i>

1128
01:19:29,743 --> 01:19:34,544
<i>When the blind man sees the picture</i>
<i>When the deaf man hears the word</i>

1129
01:19:34,715 --> 01:19:39,209
<i>When the fisherman stops fishing</i>
<i>When the hunter spares the herd</i>

1130
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:45,256
<i>We'll still hear the wondrous story</i>
<i>Of a world where people care</i>

1131
01:19:45,426 --> 01:19:49,795
<i>The story of this mighty wind</i>
<i>That's blowing everywhere</i>

1132
01:19:49,964 --> 01:19:54,697
<i>Oh, a mighty wind's a-blowing</i>
<i>It's kicking up the sand</i>

1133
01:19:54,868 --> 01:20:00,363
<i>It's blowing out a message</i>
<i>To every woman, child and man</i>

1134
01:20:00,541 --> 01:20:05,478
<i>Yes, a mighty wind's a-blowing</i>
<i>Cross the land and cross the sea</i>

1135
01:20:05,646 --> 01:20:09,548
<i>It's blowing peace and freedom</i>
<i>It's blowing equality</i>

1136
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:15,211
<i>Yes, it's blowing peace and freedom</i>
<i>It's blowing you and me</i>

1137
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:35,606
So the morning after the big show
at Town HaII...

1138
01:20:35,776 --> 01:20:38,802
...the TV network executives
were crawIing out of the woodwork...

1139
01:20:38,979 --> 01:20:43,075
...trying to get The New Main Street Singers
into a TV series.

1140
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:46,845
We took some very nice meetings.
I ran over my ideas.

1141
01:20:47,021 --> 01:20:51,481
They Ioved my idea
where the kids pIayed babies.

1142
01:20:51,659 --> 01:20:54,856
You know, in diapers. And...

1143
01:20:55,029 --> 01:20:59,295
...it aIways makes me Iaugh
to see babies taIk Iike aduIts.

1144
01:21:00,267 --> 01:21:04,135
The network execs said, ''Look, we're not
sitting in judgment of your ideas.

1145
01:21:04,305 --> 01:21:06,865
We Iove the kids,
we wanna put them on a series.''

1146
01:21:07,041 --> 01:21:10,533
And the word ''judgment,''
a Iight went on over my head!

1147
01:21:10,711 --> 01:21:13,236
I aIways thought there were
1 2 Supreme Court judges...

1148
01:21:13,414 --> 01:21:17,976
...but now it seems there are onIy nine.
I don't know if it's a budget thing or not.

1149
01:21:18,152 --> 01:21:21,747
But there's aIso nine
New Main Street Singers.

1150
01:21:21,922 --> 01:21:26,382
And I thought, ''What if they were
the Supreme Court judges?''

1151
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:31,793
And it was my idea to caII them ''The
Supreme FoIk.'' Tying in the foIk singing.

1152
01:21:31,965 --> 01:21:34,365
And here's the idea. During the day...

1153
01:21:34,702 --> 01:21:39,332
...they're handIing some of the top,
most difficuIt cases in the Iand.

1154
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:44,204
There's a Iot of tension there. And at night,
and this is what soId the networks...

1155
01:21:44,611 --> 01:21:49,605
...they Iive in one big house and they
take off their robes and sing foIk songs.

1156
01:21:49,783 --> 01:21:53,719
Now, maybe during the day they hear
death penaIty cases, and at night...

1157
01:21:53,887 --> 01:21:57,379
...they argue about who cooks dinner
or who does...

1158
01:21:57,558 --> 01:22:01,324
...the Iaundry or, ''Say, why don't
the Iadies bring the coffee?''

1159
01:22:01,495 --> 01:22:03,520
''And that's sexuaI harassment!

1160
01:22:03,697 --> 01:22:08,361
That was decided in case 1 26,
Johnson vs....''

1161
01:22:08,535 --> 01:22:12,027
Oh, I Iike that.
The women, sexuaI discrimination.

1162
01:22:12,206 --> 01:22:15,266
I'm not doing much writing,
but the ideas keep popping.

1163
01:22:20,547 --> 01:22:23,641
<i>Won't make your patients cringe</i>

1164
01:22:24,752 --> 01:22:29,246
<i>Sure-Flo, Sure-Flo</i>

1165
01:22:29,923 --> 01:22:32,892
<i>Don't leave them cold and damp</i>

1166
01:22:33,293 --> 01:22:37,024
<i>Use our buttocks drapes and penis clamp</i>

1167
01:22:39,666 --> 01:22:42,066
<i>I'm a musician again.</i>

1168
01:22:42,236 --> 01:22:47,196
<i>Being on-stage again with Mitch</i>
<i>was a great thing.</i>

1169
01:22:48,275 --> 01:22:50,766
Oh, boy. I never thought it was possibIe.

1170
01:22:50,944 --> 01:22:52,912
And there we were.

1171
01:22:54,448 --> 01:22:57,781
Just wish he didn't
take things so seriousIy.

1172
01:22:58,152 --> 01:23:00,677
You know. That damn kiss.

1173
01:23:00,921 --> 01:23:05,221
My sister-- WeII, they were aII at the show,
but my sister JoceIyn said:

1174
01:23:05,392 --> 01:23:10,557
''You Ied him on. You shouIdn't have kissed
him if you didn't wanna go aII the way.''

1175
01:23:11,098 --> 01:23:15,660
It was just a kiss. And it's part of--
The audience was there waiting for it.

1176
01:23:15,836 --> 01:23:17,804
And I forgot what that feeIs Iike...

1177
01:23:17,971 --> 01:23:21,463
...where you get caught up
in the heat of the moment...

1178
01:23:21,642 --> 01:23:24,941
...and you want to give them...

1179
01:23:25,112 --> 01:23:27,342
...anything they want.

1180
01:23:28,148 --> 01:23:30,378
I think Mitch....

1181
01:23:30,584 --> 01:23:33,178
I didn't Iead him on. But he...

1182
01:23:33,353 --> 01:23:36,049
...took it the wrong way, I think.

1183
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:40,719
I've never been in better head space.

1184
01:23:41,862 --> 01:23:45,127
I'm writing poetry again.

1185
01:23:45,299 --> 01:23:51,238
I'm going through a very proIific phase.

1186
01:23:52,039 --> 01:23:58,171
Ideas are coming faster
than I can write them.

1187
01:23:58,345 --> 01:24:02,805
My one fear in getting together
with Mickey was...

1188
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:07,413
...aIways that it might rekindIe...

1189
01:24:09,756 --> 01:24:13,624
...feeIings that she used to have for me.

1190
01:24:13,794 --> 01:24:18,231
I feeI badIy that she was misIed...

1191
01:24:18,398 --> 01:24:23,199
...by the theatrics of the moment.

1192
01:24:24,004 --> 01:24:30,239
But I think it was a wonderfuI time
that we both had together.

1193
01:24:30,410 --> 01:24:35,712
I know that I wiII aIways think
of her fondIy...

1194
01:24:35,883 --> 01:24:39,649
...every time I see a rose.

1195
01:24:43,156 --> 01:24:46,057
<i>We've got some gigs here working</i>
<i>at the casinos.</i>

1196
01:24:46,226 --> 01:24:51,493
It has been a time of changes,
but change is good. Change is Iife.

1197
01:24:52,866 --> 01:24:57,769
It was Iike a great big door
opening for me, Town HaII.

1198
01:24:57,938 --> 01:25:00,964
After that concert I reaIized...

1199
01:25:01,141 --> 01:25:04,372
...I wanna spend as much
of the rest of my Iife as possibIe...

1200
01:25:04,545 --> 01:25:08,037
-...pIaying foIk music with these gentIemen.
-Right back at you.

1201
01:25:08,215 --> 01:25:10,410
And I wanna spend aII of it as a woman.

1202
01:25:11,018 --> 01:25:15,387
I came to a reaIization that I was, and am...

1203
01:25:15,556 --> 01:25:18,923
...a bIond, femaIe foIk singer...

1204
01:25:19,092 --> 01:25:21,959
...trapped in the body of a baId,
maIe foIk singer...

1205
01:25:22,129 --> 01:25:27,795
...and I had to Iet me out or I wouId die.

1206
01:25:28,335 --> 01:25:30,997
When you put it that way,
it's aImost poetry.

1207
01:25:31,171 --> 01:25:32,297
AImost.

1208
01:25:32,472 --> 01:25:36,704
<i>Now they don't allow no frowns inside</i>
<i>Leave them by the door</i>

<i>-And sawdust on the floor</i>
