have a big row.

They might kick us out.

you would rather listen to?

doesn't make me want to kill myself?

How'd you find out?

It's the fourth one
I've had this month.

- It's not.

Yeah, well, I wouldn't worry
about it, all right?

110
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,846
You want to order some food or something
before I have to go back?

111

Maybe you should.

112

Yeah, I, I'm gonna.

113
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,563
You should have an affair.

you're talking about.

very chipper around here.

how we got from food to this, but...

OK, just listen to me for one second.

122

I don't... no, I don't want
to listen to you for a second.

123
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,523
It might be a good thing.

124
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,444
It would clear the air.

125
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,683
It would definitely
shake things up between us.

126

but on this planet,

What?

an impossible fucking year,

Oh, apparently, we're all
gonna die of something.

9h, yeah?

155
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,490
Yeah, I heard about that.

156

I can't keep up with all this shit.

I feel like my head's gonna burst.

165
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,085
Well, you should try reading
without the music on, or the TV.

166
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,446
Or both.

167
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,728
Can't stand the silence.

Thank you.

I think my memory
may be evaporating.

171
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,649
Yeah. They were all out of bran muffins,
so I got you blueberry.

172
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,928
I hate blueberries.

I don't know, you said you
wanted to talk about something.

00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,245
[stammer, sighs] Wow.

185
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,562
I don't like to get emotional
about these things.

186
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,529
It helps me stay objective.

187
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,447
I do better on my own, anyway.

188
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,681
OK.

189
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,530
Why am I here, then?

190
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,848
Oh. Yeah.

191
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,844
I need... I need a manager
to run the place.

192
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,001
No! No!

193
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,810
Aw, come on, now,
let, let me finish.

194
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,531
- I like my place. We do just fine.
- You're better than that.

195
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,967
I don't really want to have
this conversation right now.

196
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,088
I didn't furnish you with
a six-figure education

197
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,446
just so you could run some pop stand.

198
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,523
This is a real restaurant, Conor.

199
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,331
I don't want your help.

200
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,326
Just trying to give you a hand up,

201
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,926
you Wozzeck.

202
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,168
W... Well...

203
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,368
since you put it that way...

204
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,284
Fuck off.

205
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,571
Hey, El. I got Chinese food.

206
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,525
Eleanor?

207
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,207
[phone rings]

208
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,606
Hello? [clears throat softly]

209
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,522
Excuse me? I'm looking for my wife.

210
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,364
Her name is Eleanor Ludlow.

211
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,363
[nurse tapping computer keys]

212
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,249
Room 2012, second floor.

213
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,890
Elevator's around the corner.

214
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,485
- This way?
- Uh-huh.

215
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,449
- The stairs are faster.
- Thank you.

216
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,651
[monitor beeping]

217
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,806
What the hell were you doing, El?

218
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,487
[sighs]

219
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,167
I can't stand this silence anymore,
so...

220
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,527
...if you would just say something?

221
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,290
Anything?

222
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,331
I can't do this anymore.

223
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,171
Can't do what?

224
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,802
I'm not going back
to that apartment ever.

225
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,166
OK.

226
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,282
Some days everything seems fine,

227
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,649
but then I hit the afternoon,
and it all goes to shit.

228
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,131
I know.

229
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,442
I mean, I don't know, but...

230
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,685
We can get out of here.
We can go wherever you want.

231
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,611
I think we should take a break.

232
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,684
What?

233
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,644
No.

234
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,962
I'm so sorry, but no fuckin' way.

235
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,088
- Conor. Conor.
- No fuckin' way.

236
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,169
Please, El? Please?

237
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,011
Do not pick up and bail on me?

238
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,851
[sighs] You're the star
of my life story.

239
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,367
Please be cool about this.

240
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,091
[exhales] Be cool?

241
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,368
How do you expect me to react?

242
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,488
"Gee, El, that sounds dandy."

243
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,608
"Yeah, yeah, let's call it quits.

244
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,245
That, that sounds... reasonable,

245
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,890
in terms of the last seven years
of my life."

246
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,850
I need to start from scratch.

247
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,570
Alone. Just try some
other version of myself.

248
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,006
There's no "scratch," Eleanor.

249
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,128
Maybe, but that's what I want.

250
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,082
What if what you want is wrong?

251
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,729
Where have you been, Conor,
for the last six months?

252
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,930
Why does it feel like I've had
to go through all this on my own?

253
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,771
I don't know.

254
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,201
I don't know,
'cause I've been here with you.

255
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,523
Please, just let me go.
You don't understand.

256
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,045
Just"

257
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,487
[sighs] Just let me
disappear for a while.

258
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,089
Baby...

259
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,244
just tell me what to do.

260
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,531
You'll figure it out.

261
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,129
[knocking on door]

262
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,645
Hello?

263
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,811
Hey. I'm looking
for Conor and Eleanor Ludlow.

264
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,770
Yeah. Conor.

265
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,890
You think if I fall to my knees,
everything will be all right?

266
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,611
Well, no.

267
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,286
I mean, losing a child's
not an easy thing to explain.

268
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,925
What the fuck do I have to explain?

269
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,844
Nothing. You...

270
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,764
Nothing. You don't have
to explain anything.

271
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,526
I... ljust, I wanted you
to have this.

272
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,569
Do you know how many of you
assholes we've had to deal with

273
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,610
in the last couple of months?

274
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,967
Um... no, I don't.

275
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,211
I'd appreciate it if you'd
get away from my door now.

276
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,806
That's brutal.

277
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,486
Yeah, that is, uh...

278
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,967
that is brutal, man.

279
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,650
Maybe she wants you to go after her.

280
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,882
No. She doesn't.

281
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,724
Maybe wait a couple of days,
then go after her?

282
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,167
Stu, don't.

283
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,567
Well, I guess...

284
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,166
it was gonna happen...
sooner or later.

285
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,566
- Shut the fuck up.
- OK, I'm sorry,

286
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,404
I don't know what to say.
What am I supposed to say?

287
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,245
You don't have to say anything.
Just... just shut up,

288
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,402
drink and... talk
about the weather.

289
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,769
[Alexis] Hey, uh, the dude at table two
says he's gonna kick your ass

290
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,530
if he doesn't get
his chicken satay soon.

291
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,011
Well, he can suck my balls.

292
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,049
Well, maybe you
should tell him that yourself.

293
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,645
- Table two?
- Mm-hmm.

294
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,444
I'll deal With it.

295
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,806
Hey, we're out of beer.

296
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,200
What? How can we be out of beer?

297
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,521
We got two boxes back there.

298
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,404
Go and check...

299
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,489
You don't throw shit in my place, man.

300
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,648
- What's your problem?
- Where's our fucking food, man?

301
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,882
- Listen, don't threaten my chef.
- [woman] OK, calm down.

302
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,371
Don't tell me to fucking calm down.
Hey!

303
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,769
If you threaten my chef again, I will
dropkick you out of the fucking door.

304
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,524
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- [woman] Hey, come on!

305
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,920
[indistinct shouts]

306
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,848
[Stuart] Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

307
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,684
You are gonna pay.

308
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,604
- Conor, Conor, buddy, you all right?
- Get the fuck out!

309
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,489
- Fuck you!
- Yeah, fuck you, man!

310
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,883
Nice comeback. Very nice.
Get out of here. You, too.

311
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,690
Get out.

312
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,360
You forget your stupid sunglasses, too?

313
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,885
Fuckhead?

314
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,691
Maybe we should consider
hiring a bouncer.

315
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,320
Can't afford a bouncer.
It's all right.

316
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,164
Cops were good publicity.

317
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,288
Yeah, and there were, like,
4O bystanders out there.

318
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,204
Well, I appreciate the optimism, guys.

319
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,727
Sometimes the worst actions
produce the, uh, best results.

320
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,564
Sometimes they don't, Stu.

321
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,530
Oh, my God, you guys sound
like my grandparents.

322
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,125
Wait, do you want a Advil or something?

323
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,129
No, no, I'm good, thank you.

324
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,322
And you know, you don't have to
keep up the bogus compassion.

325
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,244
- It's all right.
- That's a bit aggressive.

326
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,084
Well, did you notjust
see what went down?

327
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,730
- Yeah.
- I'm kind of in a shitty mood.

328
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,042
Oh, well, we're adapting.

329
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,726
You know what,
you guys should go home.

330
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,921
- I got this.
- Sure?

331
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,286
Yeah, you should go.

332
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,010
- You got your stuff?
- Uh, yeah.

333
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,207
- My bag's back there.
- Your bag...

334
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,010
Uh... yep.

335
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,049
- You sure? I'm going...
- All right, let's go.

336
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,281
Thank you.

337
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,441
You're welcome.

338
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,411
Have a good night.

339
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,284
- Good night.
- You sure you're all right?

340
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,244
I'm good.
Thanks for being a tough guy.

00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,168
You know where the guest bedroom is.

360
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,560
Yup.

361
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,206
There's towels in the closet
in the hallway.

362
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,567
Not much in the fridge.

363
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,050
Got some Cheerios.

364
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,044
That's fine with me... I can...
I can go get some stuff.

365
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,407
That's easy.

366
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,731
Well, I got to get to the restaurant.

367
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,211
- OK.
- Good night.

368
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,566
Night.

369
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,161
I have no clue where she's going.

370
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,085
She turns off her cell phone,
and like that, she's vanished.

371
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,083
And... does that make sense to you?

372
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,049
- No comment.
- Come on, knock it off.

373
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,487
No, no, you know, whatever...
what do you call it,

374
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,244
I plead the Fifth.

375
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,801
Like, I tried to be helpful,
I pretended,

376
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,486
but it didn't work out,
so I'm not gonna do that.

377
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,967
All right, look, I realize
that I've been a little...

378
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,963
off-balance lately,
but I think with hindsight,

379
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,487
I'm learning to deal
with it better.

380
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,210
A couple of weeks counts
as hindsight?

381
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,561
Fuckin' A, Stu.

382
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,085
I got nothing for you.

383
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,366
Come on, come on.

384
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,284
Look, I, I'm just asking you
a simple question.

385
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,489
You don't have to candy-coat it
like you're gonna hurt my feelings,

386
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,688
but... did you see this coming?

387
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,164
Look, with the exception of my dog,
I haven't slept next to the same person

388
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,403
for more than two or three days in a
row, so I don't know what I'm gonna say

389
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,608
that's gonna be relevant
to your situation.

390
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,569
I opened a restaurant for you, asshole.

391
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,848
No, you opened a restaurant for you,
asshole.

392
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,800
And according to the <i>Village</i> Voice,
it's "a bar with uninspired food."

393
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,008
Whatever. I fight for its life for you.

394
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,006
And by the way, I'm incurring the cost
of an extra waitress because, I quote,

395
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,650
"She looked at me the right way."

396
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,961
And I thank you for that.

397
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,963
- Has it happened yet?
- It's...

398
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,690
- It's gonna, yeah.
- Whatever.

399
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,050
Look, I'm not looking
for some psychoanalytical,

400
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,043
New-Agey bull.

401
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,527
I... I'm simply asking for
my best friend's opinion,

402
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,762
even it is an uninformed piece of crap.

403
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,160
OK.

404
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,606
"We are young."

405
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,166
Uh-huh.

406
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,561
"Heartache to heartache, we stand.

407
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,610
No promises, no demands.

408
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,491
Love is a battlefield."
Pat Benatar.

409
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,847
You're a fucking idiot.

410
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,850
Look, I feel like I walk
on eggshells around you.

411
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,526
You know? Uh...

412
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,523
I tried to talk to you
about this for months...

413
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,045
I'm not talking about that.

414
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,328
This is what I'm talking about, man.

415
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,170
I don't know how to be
your friend anymore.

416
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,404
You know, you're no fucking picnic.

417
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,601
So I'm just gonna...
I'm just gonna sit.

418
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,366
I'm just gonna sit here.
I'm just gonna be here.

419
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,000
And I'm not gonna say a thing.

420
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,130
I'm sorry.

421
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,446
OK.

422
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,242
- But I'm asking you now.
- [sighs]

423
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,642
Uh... [sighs]

424
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,485
You guys not making it
makes sense to me.

425
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,325
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

426
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,448
When someone flirts
with extinction...

427
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,842
...l think they got to do

428
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,168
whatever they got to do
in order to...

429
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,010
get their life in order.

430
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,087
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

431
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,764
[sighs]

432
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,242
Look, I saw her the other day.

433
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,450
- You what?
- I saw her.

434
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,642
- Where?
- Astor Place.

435
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,561
- Did you... did you talk to her?
- No.

436
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,006
- You didn't talk to her?
- No. No.

437
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,924
She, she was, uh, she was far away.

438
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,890
She was walking away.
She was going to class or something.

439
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,485
Class?

440
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,449
Yeah. She had her book bags
with her or something.

441
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,125
- She was going to class.
- What school?

442
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,611
Like NYU or Cooper Union or...

443
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,886
- I don't know!
- The New School?

444
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,923
I don't know.
It's not hard to find out.

445
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,770
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I just did.

446
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,962
What are you guys talking about?

447
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,963
- You.
- Oh...

448
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,968
[I low-tempo music]

449
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,083
[I music playing over stereo
from other room]

450
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,245
[sighs]

451
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,202
[music blaring]

452
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,606
H9)'-

453
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,450
[turns volume down]

454
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,011
OK?

455
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,561
- [rain falling]
- Um...

456
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,446
I'm not here to approve...

457
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,927
or disapprove... just so you know.

458
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,684
Hm?

459
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:43,641
Your mother always gave me crap
for never stepping up to the plate.

460
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,802
Uh... OK. What?

461
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,291
She said I never stepped up.

462
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,602
Uh, I'm sorry, what does that
have to do with anything?

463
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,765
Well... you're a bit like me.

464
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,208
No, I'm not.

465
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,046
No, I'm fucking not.

466
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,486
I stepped UP-

467
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,565
OK. So what else?

468
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,204
Nothing.

469
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,089
Nothing. We don't have to keep talking.

470
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,969
Yeah, but you're the one
who came into the room.

471
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,168
Yeah, to turn down your stupid music.

472
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,766
Oh. Every day...

473
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,810
I do one thing that makes me happy.

474
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,440
All right? One thing...
and that is I...

475
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,047
listen to my stupid music
while reading the stupid paper.

476
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,607
And that's the best way
I've found to deal with myself.

477
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,649
SO just

478
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,446
back to the... guest room
and count the fuckin' raindrops.

479
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,206
"Count the fuckin' raindrops"?

480
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,600
[groans]

481
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,889
I was never very good
at this kind of thing.

482
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,365
- [sets glass down hard]
- [rainfall continues]

483
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,807
OK.

484
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,964
It isn't yourjob to investigate

485
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,886
the expansive memory
that's called "the past"

486
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:05,204
and judge what is right
and what is...

487
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,051
Seriously, what the fuck
are you talking about?

488
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,528
You shouldn't be interested
in regretting things.

489
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,486
I'm not.

490
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,404
[turns volume up]

491
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,084
[ringtone playing]

492
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,849
Hey, Stu, what's up?

493
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,048
[whispering]
I'm looking at her right now.

494
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,168
Wait, wait, wait,
I can't hear you, man.

495
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:45,166
I'm looking at her right now.

496
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,004
Stu, I can't understand
a word you're saying.

497
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,568
I'm looking at your wife.

498
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,846
She's ordering food.

499
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,604
Where are you?

500
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,967
The Smile.

501
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,925
Conor? Conor?

502
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,045
[panfing]

503
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,929
Hey, hey. Where is she?

504
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,286
She left.

505
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,601
What do you mean, she left?

506
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,841
Exactly what it sounds like:
shelefi.

507
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,331
Why didn't you follow her?

508
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,568
I'm not a creep.
I'm not gonna follow her.

509
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,484
[panfing]

510
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,325
[low, indistinct chatter]

511
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,521
[indistinct chatter]

512
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,964
Let's do this.

513
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,282
[professor] Most people
could probably provide

514
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,363
an intuitive answer
to this question.

515
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,205
At the bottom,
the sense of self corresponds

516
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:27,082
to that experience
of ownership and impenetrability

517
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,049
of one's thoughts,

518
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,522
of... one's internal dialogues,

519
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:36,207
of one's affective states...

520
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,089
that many, but not all,

521
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,050
- of us have from infancy.
- [Conor whispers] Hey.

522
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,771
Can I borrow a piece
of paper and a pen?

523
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,729
[professor] ...solitude
is held as constituting...

524
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,291
Please.

525
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,644
[professor] ...our sense
of personal uniqueness...

526
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,325
...of identification,
- Thanks.

527
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,926
- Of demarcation from others.
- And... the pen?

528
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,242
[professor] And it's
perhaps that very same...

529
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,481
I'll give it back.

530
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,404
...solitude that...

531
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,927
Descartes had in mind
when he redefined

532
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,249
the concepts
of subject and subjectivity.

533
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,721
You know, ultimately,
being oneself means

534
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,924
that the faculty of knowing...

535
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:17,404
the faculty of knowing lies
within the subject...

536
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,722
in his head, and...

537
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,724
the subject has such a status

538
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,646
by dint of being enclosed
within himself,

539
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,290
separate and...

540
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,484
[Conor whispers] Hi again.

541
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:37,204
Would you mind passing this
to the girl with the red hair?

542
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,368
Come on, please?

543
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,761
[professor] ...we say,
"What's got into you?"

544
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,127
to express surprise...

545
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,884
Thanks a lot.
Don't forget your pen.

546
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,607
[professor] ...disapproval of
unexpected and bizarre behavior.

547
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,602
[professor] And again...

548
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,842
[chuckles] doesn't common sense...

549
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,607
- Red hair. Thank you.
- ...tell us that strange behavior

550
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,962
is signaled by tapping

551
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,090
one's forehead
with one's forefinger.

552
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,288
Boy, I'm learning something.

553
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,891
[students chuckling]

554
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,327
So, "Why the Mind ls in the Head"
is the title

555
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,324
of one of the lectures
delivered at the 1951,

556
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,324
um, symposium.

557
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,164
But, um...

558
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,971
[whispers] Hey.

559
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,643
...one of the most authoritative voices
in this chorus is Ken Bergens,

560
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,406
who asked the question:

561
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,849
Can we compellingly reinscribe
what it is to be...

562
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,288
[paper crinkling]

563
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,681
[professor]
...the individualist premise

564
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,844
and toward the relational...

565
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,570
Hey!

566
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,200
- Hey, Rigby.
- What the fuck are you doing?

567
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,521
What? Come on, I...

568
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,682
I barely got a chance to
respond before you went AWOL.

569
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,808
- What did I ask you, Conor?
- Just give me a second to talk.

570
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,008
- What the fuck did I ask you!
- Just give me a goddamn second!

571
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,366
I gave you plenty of seconds!

572
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,522
Do me a favor, leave me the fuck alone!

573
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,364
[panting] Fine.

574
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,808
Fine, you do what you got to do.
You just keep fuckin' walking...

575
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,048
Conor?

576
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,690
Oh, shit!

577
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,406
- Conor?
- [man] ls he all right?

578
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,288
Well, that was exciting.

579
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,886
Yeah, it was awesome.

580
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,202
So you're back in school?

581
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,727
I'm taking some classes.

582
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,687
I almost didn't recognize you.

583
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,410
What do you mean?

584
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,642
[sighs]

585
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,690
Just your hair.

586
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,205
Oh.

587
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,362
It's really pretty.

588
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,529
Where are you living?

589
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,928
None of your business.

590
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,764
[sighs]

591
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,650
So, is that what you so desperately
needed to talk to me about?

592
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,086
No.

593
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,208
What is it, then?

594
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,450
I was gonna say
something really good.

595
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,248
It would've solved all our problems

596
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,721
and made everything all better.

597
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,801
I just forgot what it was.

598
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,964
That's too bad.

599
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,804
I know.

600
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,727
I'm gonna go.

601
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,566
Well, hey...

602
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,891
I just want...

603
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,840
I just want some time
to talk it out, El.

604
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,686
Then you can disappear off to
wherever it is you disappear to.

605
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,890
You ready, sir?

606
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,761
[exhales] Yeah.

607
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,007
Yeah, I was born ready.

608
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,128
All right. Nice and easy.

609
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,169
There you go.
Watch your step.

610
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,482
[groans]

611
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,722
See you around.

612
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,406
- All right, watch your head coming up.
- You got him?

613
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,369
- I got him.
- [Conor groans]

614
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,885
Now, take it easy.

615
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,001
Strap in for me.

616
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,128
OK.

617
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,687
[exhales]

618
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,047
May I keep stalking you?

619
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,444
Good-bye, Conor.

620
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,844
[siren chirps]

621
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,523
Look, just tell me how long...

622
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,327
[sighs] All right. Look, I'll
call you tomorrow, and we'll...

623
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,251
talk through the... logistics.

624
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,928
Yeah. No. No, that's it.

625
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,366
All right, thank you.

626
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,966
Sure.

627
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,724
[exhales]

628
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,564
Unreal.

629
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,571
- You have fun? Shall we...?
- Yeah.

630
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,122
- Say good night.
- Good night.

631
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,964
Well, it's been real, everybody.

632
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:49,045
- [Alexis] No, it hasn't.
- Hey. Goddamn it.

633
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,690
Slow night?

634
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,450
Couple of people came in
to use the bathroom.

635
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,410
- How we doing?
- Well, aside from being

636
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,131
an endangered species, not so good.

637
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,486
Can you translate that for me, please?

638
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,287
Friday night, it's the only night
we're making any money.

639
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,131
I... I have missed some bills,

640
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,806
and... we can't cover the overhead.

641
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,042
I see.

642
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,690
Yeah.

643
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,649
You got a plan B?

644
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,322
- Burger King?
- [Conor chuckling]

645
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,847
Seriously. Come on,
I want to show you something.

646
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,407
- This is the spreadsheet from...
- No, no, I can't.

647
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,722
Um...

648
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,331
[Conor whispers] Oh.

649
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,529
Oh. You got protection?

650
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,570
- Shh...
- Viagra?

651
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,489
- Please be quiet.
- You want me to hold your hand?

652
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,091
- Shut your mouth. Shut up.
- Want me to watch?

653
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,605
Dude, I'm being serious. Shut up.

654
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,330
- Don't...
- You got it. Anytime.

655
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,323
You're ruining it.
Can you just shut up?

656
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,090
- [Conor] It's cool.
- I believe.

657
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,810
- In what?
- A higher power.

658
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,041
Can you hear it?

659
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,043
Not right now.

660
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,531
- [woman] Later.
- [Stuart] Bye.

661
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,048
- [Alexis] Bye.
- [Conor] You guys have fun.

662
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,322
[door opens]

663
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,244
[door closes]

664
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,205
You know, I got a plan B.

665
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,725
9h, yeah?

666
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,326
You know what, you can...
you can get out of here.

667
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,962
I was thinking about getting
my real estate license.

668
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,884
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

669
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,486
[chuckles] Why would, uh...

670
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,881
Why would you do something like that?

671
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,045
Uh, 'cause it seems more
impressive than pouring drinks.

672
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,531
Does it? All right.

673
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,563
What happened to your life in the arts?

674
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,802
Oh, that'll probably phase in to a...

675
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,725
the Sunday afternoon hobby
kind of thing.

676
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,120
YOU?

677
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,080
Plus, I think it's kind of indecent
to have things so worked out

678
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,602
that they wind up exactly
like you thought they would.

679
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,407
Oh.

680
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,130
Are you gonna be OK?

681
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,884
[sighs]

682
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,608
Probably.

683
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,481
We live in a world full of probablys.

684
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,728
Well...

685
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,127
I'm a decent listener...

686
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,011
if you ever want to talk
about, you know...

687
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,571
whatever.

688
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,726
Talking about whatever's overrated.
I preferjust to, you know,

689
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,121
let things stew inside of me,
then have a violent out...

690
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,081
What'd you do that for?

691
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,963
It just seemed like the next
interesting thing to do.

692
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,724
I'm, I'm kind of married.

693
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,484
Yeah? I don't mind.

694
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,007
I kind of do.

695
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,924
Uh, there's nobody looking.

696
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,048
You know, in... in another life, I...

697
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,970
[Conor] Mm. We shouldn't do this.

698
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,804
When's the last time that
you got laid properly?

699
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,007
Flaughsl

700
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,564
Oh, fuck, I can already
taste the regret.

701
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,371
Well, stop thinking,
because it's not healthy for you.

702
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,170
- Alexis?
- Yes?

703
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,163
Tomorrow's gonna be awkward.

704
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,845
Probably.

705
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,484

H9)'-

707
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,045
Hi.

708
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,002
What are you doing in here?

709
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,929
I was just checking on things.

710
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,366
Yeah?

711
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,727
I was about to feed him.

712
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,645
Oh, fuck.

713
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,246
You're not supposed
to give up on me this easily.

714
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,682
Got him for Cody.

715
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,406
Yeah, I know that. Thanks.

716
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,451
[sighs]

717
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,928
What was a two-month-old baby supposed
to do with a fuckin' fish anyway?

718
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,567
You look like shit.

719
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,563
Thanks.

720
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:21,203
So... what do you want
to do with him?

721
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,891
Is there something wrong with you?

722
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,206
Most likely. Why do you ask?

723
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,806
Just... all the reflective
talk the other night,

724
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,401
it was, uh, just a tad weird.

725
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,689
I suppose I hit the sauce
a little too hard.

726
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,406
You're not dying
or something, are you?

727
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,483
Not that I know of.

728
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,484
Although I did forget
my name the other day.

729
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,966
Yeah?

730
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,168
I was at Starbucks ordering a coffee,

731
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,563
and the guy behind the counter...
said, "What's your name, sir?"

732
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:00,170
and... ljust got... stuck in a blank.

733
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,681
No idea who I was for a good minute,

734
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,889
until, uh, in the end,
I just had to walk out.

735
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,566
I'm sure that happens
to a lot of people.

736
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,961
On the road to senior citizenship.

737
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,481
[chuckles]

738
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,404
Yeah. Yeah, you are.

739
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:20,043
On a clear day, I can see the end
of my life staring me in the face.

740
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,565
You know, it's fucking bizarre,

741
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,087
one day, you turn the corner
of your street

742
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,164
and everything's changed,
but you never saw it happening.

743
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,961
It's like it's all been
sucked up into some kind of...

744
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,804
cosmic vacuum cleaner.

745
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,241
You're the same age now

746
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,364
as I was when you were born.

747
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,329
Now, that's freakin' absurd.

748
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,130
Where are you going with this?

749
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,049
I'm not going anywhere with it.

750
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,450
My slut of a wife left me
gathering dust on the couch,

751
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,161
and now the only thing
left to do is nothing.

752
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,846
Well, that's what you get for
marrying a woman half your age.

753
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,326
Aw, fuck you.

754
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,767
Fuck you, man. Fuck you.

755
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,487
Seriously, don't lay this "owner of
a lonely heart" bullshit on me.

756
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,483
L... [sighs]

757
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,007
[chuckles] I watched this happen.

758
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,491
She was just one in a long line

759
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,682
of arm candy I watched you
fuckin' plow through

760
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,604
in the last, what, 17 years?

761
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,730
17 years since you got tired
of my mother, so, please...

762
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,805
It was, uh, it was pretty inevitable
you were gonna age out of it.

763
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,645
Do you think I enjoy
feeling like an asshole?

764
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,802
Yeah, it kind of seems like it.

765
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:35,163
You know, I was warming up
to try and tell you something nice.

766
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,970
Yeah?

767
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,969
Go ahead.

768
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,361
We all know a little
something about sadness.

769
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,170
Or whatever you want to call it.

770
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,563
Yeah, well, I want to know
a little less about it.

771
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,127
Anyway, how's that supposed to be nice?

772
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,486
Have you talked to her at all?

773
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,761
- Shall we do this?
- Yeah.

774
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,327
Want to say a couple of
words for closure's sake?

775
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,486
Does that ever really close anything?

776
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,085
No.

777
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,089
Bye, Ralph.

778
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,129
[I low-tempo music]

779
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,480
[knocking on door]

780
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,325
Oh.

781
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,808
[whispers] What the...?

782
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,082
I'm sorry.

783
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,368
I wasn't expecting you.

784
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,760
No,no,no.

785
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:18,402
No, I wasn't... wasn't expecting me,
either, so...

786
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,285
- Hi.
- Hey.

787
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,486
[sighs]

788
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,290
Is she here?

789
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,450
No.

790
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,604
Is, is she living here?

791
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,483
Do you want to come in for a second?

792
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,684
Would that be all right?

793
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,205
Yeah. Come in.

794
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,566
OK.

795
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,121
Thanks, Mary.

796
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:59,011
Are you sure you don't want
a glass of wine?

797
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,690
- No?
- No.

798
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,205
[chuckles quietly]

799
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,806
I probably shouldn't get started.

800
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,361
[chuckles]

801
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,046
I started already. [laughs]

802
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,049
Can I ask how she's doing?

803
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,407
I don't know,
to be completely honest.

804
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,608
As good as she can be.

805
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,250
Do I seem like
a different person to you?

806
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,882
Do you feel like a different person?

807
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,641
Yeah, kind of.

808
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,406
You look the same to me.

809
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,722
You know I didn't like you

810
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,651
when Eleanor first brought
you out here for dinner.

811
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,126
[laughs softly]

812
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,123
However long ago it was.

813
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,442
How long ago was it?

814
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,051
Seven years.

815
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,851
[gasps] Seven years?

816
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,570
Yeah.

817
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,083
You sat there in the exact
same spot seven years ago,

818
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:18,450
with a glass of water because you were
afraid to have a drink in front of me.

819
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,407
This obnoxiously perfect kid who walked
off with my daughter's attention.

820
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,642
[laughs softly]

821
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,609
You grew on me, though.

822
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,091
Oh, well.

823
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,526
Flaughsl

824
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,444
It's true.

825
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,001
Look,L"

826
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:42,289
I don't want to interfere
with your life,

827
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,761
or whatever she has to do,

828
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,763
but I can't...

829
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,890
I can'tjust chalk this up to destiny.

830
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,411
I walked on with my life because...

831
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,530
moving forward was,
was the only way to go.

832
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,485
I guess people grieve differently.

833
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,964
I wish there was some appropriate,
articulate thing to say, but...

834
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,731
I just wanted the mundane
daily bullshit back.

835
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,451
I think Eleanor wanted something else.

836
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,364
And I think that, um...

837
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:25,609
...there was nothing appropriate
about any of this.

838
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,490
- [Stuart] I don't get it, man.
- What don't you get?

839
00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:01,044
Well, your... your dad is, like,
the, like, a culinary maverick.

840
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,009
He's, like, the Mick Jagger
of the restaurant game.

841
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,881
All you got to do is make one phone call
and it saves our asses, but instead,

842
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:11,807
you want us to drown, like 90 percent
of the other restaurants in the city.

843
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,689
- I don't get it.
- Stu, Stu...

844
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,810
- Well, I... What did he do?
- What do you mean, "What did he do?"

845
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,566
Your dad, what did he do? I mean, at
least take a page out of his book.

846
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,245
- What did he do?
- He married my mom.

847
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,408
- What does that mean?
- That means he married my mom.

848
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:27,281
She gave him all the money her family
left her, and he opened the restaurant,

849
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,602
it was a big success, and then
he dropped her like a bad habit.

850
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,966
So, you know what?

851
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,084
Why don't you go and find yourself
some lonely, loaded old lady

852
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,129
- and then we can take it from there.
- Well...

853
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,964
You know what,
I'd rather fail catastrophically

854
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,122
than, you know,
give him the satisfaction

855
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,850
of thinking he handed me my life
on a platter.

856
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,525
That is the stupidest
thing in the history

857
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,806
- of stupid things to say.
- Whoa.

858
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,531
Why is that stupid? Why is that stupid?
You know what's stupid?

859
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,326
You think I'm gonna call my dad, and
he's gonna go, like, "Hey, son, yeah.

860
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,608
Why don't you come and bring your
friends, and they can work here, too."

861
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,286
- Yeah.
- It's not a fuckin' slumber party.

862
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,851
No, it's not a slumber... It's a job.

863
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,924
- Stu, as decent a cook as you are...
- I'm a chef.

864
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:03,926
All right, chef, you don't exactly
cut it in those kitchens.

865
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,321
Oh, relax. You don't want
to have this conversation.

866
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,289
- Let's talk about it.
- You don't want this conversation.

867
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,566
When's the last time
you julienned a carrot?

868
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,245
- You really want to have
- Seriously.

869
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,811
- This conversation? You really
- When's the last time

870
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,405
- want to have this conversation?
- you cooked an egg

871
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,050
- You really want to have
- and you didn't blanch the yolk?

872
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,770
You know, in those kinds
of kitchens, in that world...

873
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,291
...this conversation?
I've been pulling my weight fine.

874
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,044
- ...you would be a busboy.
- You're the one...

875
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,611
- You fuckhead. Fucking failure.
- Yeah, no. I'm telling you, man.

876
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,250
You know what,
those stupid glasses out there

877
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,164
- need picking up.
- Fuck you.

878
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,322
You like that?

879
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,323
- Fucking asshole.
- Wait, whoa!

880
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,766
You hit me with fucking kale?

881
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,080
That all you got?

882
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,321
Come on.

883
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:37,681
Oh, God! Jesus. Ow!

884
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,482
Ow, ow!

885
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,449
[grunting]

886
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,087
Roll!

887
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,530
OK, OK, yeah, yeah.

888
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,681
This is what you want?

889
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,922
[Conor and Stuart grunting]

890
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,128
Is that a joke?

891
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:03,602
No, I think they're really going at it.

892
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,081
We're not quite open yet.

893
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,284
Are you all right?

894
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,283
[panfing]

895
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,363
I was third in my class.

896
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,251
The New York Academy of
Culinary Arts, you fuckhead.

897
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,890
I know that, asshole.

898
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,884
[continues panting]

899
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,850
[quietly] Call me "chef."

901
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,570
I love our little set-up here.

902
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,200
I do.

903
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,522
Just, the lease has gotten
prohibitively expensive,

904
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,001
and unless you want
to camp out in the kitchen...

905
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,725
[continues panting]

906
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:41,089
OK. I'll... I'll bring
the sleeping bags.

907
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,327
It's just... time to let go.

908
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,689
Time to grow up.

909
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,564
I am grown up.

910
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,046
Iam.

911
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,565
Fine.

912
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,406
When do we call it quits?

913
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,523
End of next week.

914

[sighs]

915
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,644
Can we have one last banger
before we... close shop?

916
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,609
Yeah.

917
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,482
Can we abuse some heavy narcotics?

918
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,290
Whatever tickles your thing.

919
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,090
Good.

920
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,605
I'm sorry.

921
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:24,841
Blow me.

922
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,769
OK.

923
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,049
[groans]

924
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,924
[Eleanor] Yeah, it's amazing.
So you're well?

925
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,889
I'm OK.

926
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,326
- Good.
- Yeah.

927
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:43,485
I'm just painting, and...
here, and... you know,

928
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:44,880
- that same stuff.
- Hey, hey, hey.

929
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,326
Sorry.

930
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:49,126
[chuckles, mumbles]

931
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,521
Holy Shatner.

932
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,523
Nice to see you, too, Stuart.

933
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,526
Well, this is nice.

934
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,523
Like old times,
reconnecting and all.

935
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,762
- I'm gonna go to the kitchen.
- Yeah.

936
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,730
I will join you.

937
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:38,722
- Shirley Temple?
- Please.

938
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,531
What do I owe you?

939
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,489
Your money's no good here.

940
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,880
You know that.

941
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,041
OK.

942
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:04,166
Business is good?

943
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,049
It's great.

944
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,330
We're closing.

945
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,925
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

946
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,401
Yeah, me, too.

947
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,409
So, what's next?

948
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,927
I don't know.

949
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:37,007
I, I thought I might...
develop some interests in things

950
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,686
that people actually take
an interest in.

951
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,081
You gonna work with your dad?

952
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,526
Hmm?

953
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,449
[laughs softly]

954
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:52,408
You know, before you,
I had no idea who I was.

955
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:59,321
Then when we were together,
I thought I had it all figured out.

956
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,126
Now I'm just back to wondering again.

957
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:13,405
Well, when you figure it out,
tell me how, OK?

958
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:14,766
OK.

959
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,728
Let's get out of here.

960
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,769
- What?
- Let's go.

961
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,809
- Right now?
- Yeah. That's the idea.

962
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,007
Uh...

963
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,924
I don't believe in wasting time.

964
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,206
OK.

965
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,645
Yeah, uh...

966
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,930
Don't forget to fill it up
before you drop it off.

967
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,684
You got it.

985
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,251
Of course we get the car
with the retarded wipers.

986
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,402
We could just wait it out.

987
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,563
What are we doing here?

988
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,803
You tell me.

989
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:28,042
You're the one who said
that we needed to talk.

990
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,282
You stalked me,
you went to my parents' house.

991
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,090
What are we doing here?

992
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:35,642
Just recently, like an hour ago,
you walked into my bar

993
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:39,691
and you suggested we drive aimlessly
into the perfect fucking storm here.

994
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:44,361
This is funny.

995
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,124
Yeah.

996
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,926
[chuckling] Yeah,
it's fuckin' hilarious.

[laughing]

998
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,926
You know, for a while there,
I thought we'd actually pieced together

999
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,206
a pretty decent life.

1000
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:20,766
I have to move everything out
of the apartment next week.

1001
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:25,930
Do you want me to keep anything for you?

1002
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:28,606
Where will you move to?

1003
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,330
I don't know.

1004
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:34,644
I could stay with my dad for a little
while, till I get things figured out.

1005
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,643
How is he?

1006
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,007
Oh...

1007
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:42,323
I'm pretty certain he's losing his mind.

1008
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,289
Fernanda left him.

1009
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:47,125
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1010
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,965
He's getting all talkative.

1011
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,929
Waxing philosophical.

1012
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:55,687
Same shit he pulls every time
he's between significant others.

1013
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:58,241
I think it's probably more than that.

1014
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:01,960
[sighs] Yeah, maybe.

1015
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:04,202
At least you guys are talking.

1016
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,528
[chuckles wryly] Yeah.

1017
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:08,682
What'd you tell your parents about us?

1018
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,202
What would I say?

1019
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:15,681
That we're fabulous.

some dreadful disaster clich?.

- No, no, no, no.
- No, wait, wait.

1032
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:29,050

[whispers] I'm sorry.

1034
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:47,650
It doesn't matter.

1035
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,804
What do you mean, it doesn't matter?

1036
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:52,291
Get off me.

- Get off.

What do you mean, it doesn't matter?

1039
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,602
Get over yourself, Conor.

1040
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,167
- You don't care?
- No.

1041
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:10,244
That's bullshit. I know you care.

1042
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:14,365
El, you're supposed to say, "What the
fuck are you thinking, Conor?"

1043
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,522
You're supposed to say,
"You're a selfish piece of shit."

1044
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:17,841
No.

1045
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,651
We're past that.

1046
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:23,087
And you just said it for me.

1047
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:25,766

Some of the same faces still show up,
except more wrinkled.

1064
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,565
Some of them less so.

1065
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:15,767
[chuckles]

1066
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,206
The Stones were in last week,

1067
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:20,131
after playing the Garden, but...

1068
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:22,891
mostly people are just fading away.

1069
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:28,571
I've been doing this way too long.

1070
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:31,644
I think you done pretty good.

1071
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:36,169
Yeah, well, complacency
scares the shit out of me.

1072
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:39,408
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1073
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:41,050
Then how's this?

1074
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,090
I, uh, forfeited the loan
the bank gave me,

1075
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:46,811
I'm losing the lease on my bar...

1076
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:52,251
Eleanor's gone...
with the fucking wind.

1077
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:58,129
I'm 33 years old,
and my life's a fucking boat wreck.

1078
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:03,081
I'm in my 60s.

1079
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:08,207
I lost a grandson this year that I'm
basically forbidden to talk about,

1080
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:10,761
my third wife just walked out on me,

1081
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:13,366
and I come here every afternoon
to this restaurant

1082
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,330
named after your mother.

1083
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,321
It's time to shoot the crow.

1084
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:23,766
Where are you gonna go?

1085
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,809
You gonna fly off
to Never-Never Land?

1086
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:27,450
Become a Buddhist?

1087
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:28,971
[laughs softly]

1088
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:33,728
Tell you what, you can return
and enlighten us all.

1089
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,962
Oh, fuck enlightenment.

1090
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:39,442
I'm hoping to figure out some
way of dealing with reality.

1091
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,364
[laughs softly]

1092
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,121
What are you doing here, anyway?

1093
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:48,563
I was... I was just
in the neighborhood.

1094
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,762
"Just in the neighborhood."

1095
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,609
What is it?

1096
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:07,169
Do you ever wonder why we fall in love
with a specific person?

1097
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,962
Not really.

1098
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:15,567
I think to myself,
"Something's wrong here,

1099
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:18,200
but I can't quite put my finger
on what it is."

1100
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,164
[scoffs]

1101
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,321
There's always one that haunts us.

1102
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,809
So give her time.

1103
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:34,005
It's the right thing to do,
given the circumstances.

1104
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,724
Circumstances suck.

1105
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:40,684
Yeah.

1106
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:49,163
I really forbid you
from talking about him?

1107
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,129
Uh-huh.

1108
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,810
What the fuck are you gonna say to me?

1109
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:08,124
Ever since he...

1110
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,763
Ever since what happened happened,

1111
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,524
any thought or,
or memory of him

1112
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:17,489
has been something
just to run my mind

1113
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:20,041
as far as fuck away from
as I can get, and...

1114
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:22,521
[stammers, sighs]

1115
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:35,961
A shooting star only lasts a second,

1116
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:40,808
but... aren't you glad
to at least have seen it?

1117
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,409
That's nice.

1118
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:55,882
It's a little Hallmark,
but it's nice.

1119
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,082
[chuckles] I mean it, it's nice.

1120
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,368
You have a delicate soul, Dad.

1121
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,443
Oh, nobody ever said that to me before.

1122
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:07,206
You know, we're in imminent
danger of sappiness.

1123
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:10,250
Oh, we can't have that, can we?

1124
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,447
Mm-mm.

1125
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,285
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

1126
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:15,965
I'll fix you something up.

1127
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:17,690
OK.

1128
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:28,689
[I up-tempo rock music]

1129
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:31,047
[lively chatter]

1130
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:42,364
Hey, you got my drinks?

1131
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,010
Yeah. Does anyone else work here?

1132
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,525
- Not right now.
- Guess what?

1133
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:46,727
- What?
- No more beer.

1134
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:49,651
- [both laugh]
- Ah, shocker. All right.

1135
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:52,571
Hey, this is the last
of the beer, so drink it slowly.

1136
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:55,047
However, there's plenty more liquor.
Enjoy.

1137
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:56,326
Table four, right?

1138
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:57,891
Yeah. Thank you.

1139
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,690
Hey, guys.
Get you a beverage?

1140
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:01,410
- Uh... uh...
- Baby?

1141
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,284
Uh... just a beer, please?

1142
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:05,164
Uh, actually, we're
all out of beer right now.

1143
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:07,641
Oh, um, then just a glass
of red wine would be good.

1144
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,370
You got it. And for you, sir?

1145
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,249
- Same.
- OK.

1146
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,041
[man] Something wrong?

1147
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:17,447
Uh".no,no.

_ Yes?

1149
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,127
- Two reds, table four.
- Got it.

1150
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:26,648
Hey, Stu, where's Alexis?

1151
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,968
[Alexis] Hello?

1152
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:35,771
- [Conor] Hey.
- What? Oh, I'm not taking a shit.

1153
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:37,206
- We're smoking it.
- I don't even want to know.

1154
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,169
Can I interrupt you two
forjust a second?

1155
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:41,561
- Mm-hmm.
- I have something very important

1156
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:45,441
to ask you, for probably the last time.

1157
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,080
Shouldn't you be cooking
some fucking food?

1158
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:50,083
[chuckles softly]

1159
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:52,163
- [Alexis laughs]
- Come on.

1160
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:54,601
- All right. You're right.
- Me, me, me.

1161
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,808
Mm, are you guys fucking?

1162
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,450
Hey, get the fuck out of here.

1163
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,125
Come on, go make some mediocre bar food.

1164
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:01,645
Stupid.

1165
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,211
Come here. Come here, come here.

- I Iov... Ooh, yeah, I love you.

01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,410
Go. Go.
Wash your hands, OK?

1169
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,801
Should we get back in there?

1170
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,405
[chuckles]

1171
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,640

1172
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,804
- Here we are in the bathroom.
- [laughs] Here we are.

1173
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:29,727
- Alexis, about the other...
- So, you two

1174
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:33,441
gallop off into the sunset
the other day?

1175
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,170
Oh, yeah.

1176
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,806
Didn't you hear? [exhales]

1177
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:41,681
Happy ending and everything.

1178
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:45,606
You know, I could fall
madly in love with you.

1179
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:49,287
I'm not sure that would be
the smartest thing.

1180
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,488
Why is that?

1181
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:57,249
You know, it's funny how a person,
just by living,

1182
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:00,244
can damage another person beyond repair.

1183
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:08,331
How's that funny?

1184
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:10,443
I don't know.

1185
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,524

1194

This is his place.
Don't worry about it.

1195

He's the only one who can throw them.

1196

- No, not...
- Oh, give me a kiss, give me a kiss.

H9)'-

1238
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:44,250
When did we get all this stuff?

1239
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:50,966
I don't know. I...

1240
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,487
I guess it kind of accumulated.

1241
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:03,564
You can... store some of it at my
parents' house if you want.

1242
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:05,609
No.

1243
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:11,405
I was thinking I could get a storage
unit, till we figure things out.

1244
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:21,529
I'm sorry.

1245
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,520
What are you thinking?

1246
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:41,368
That memory's so fucking weird.

1247
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:43,324
How's that?

1248
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,841
I forgot what he looks like.

1249
01:22:57,200 --> 01:22:59,680
Sometimes I'll get a...

1250
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:02,491
quick glimpse of his eyes...

1251
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,646
...oras...

1252
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:11,407
a small smile he used to
give me from the crib.

1253
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:18,769
[whispers] But then he vanishes.

1254
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:25,330
I can't picture his face.

1255
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:34,205
I can't picture his face anymore.

1256
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:45,645
Pale.

1257
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,767
He was pale.

1258
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:58,161
He had tiny ears.

1259
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:06,681
He had your nose.

1260
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:09,241
Your mouth.

1261
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,121
Your chin.

1262
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:15,362
- He had your...
- [Eleanor sobs]

1263
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:21,006
But he had my eyes.

1264
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:25,481
And I loved that.

1265
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:28,246
[crying softly]

1266
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:32,041
And he was the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

1267
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:43,569
[crying] I wasn't ready
for what this feels like.

1268
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,842
Neither of us were.

1269
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,928
[quietly] I just want him back.

1270
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:57,889
I know.

1271
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:12,124
[Eleanor sobs]

1272
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,363
I love you.

1273
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:36,961
I know.

1274
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:58,684
[sighs]

1275
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:36,850
He)', guys...

1276
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:39,327
I'm gonna go take a stroll
before the rush, OK?

1277
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:41,289
- [Phoebe] OK.
- OK.

1278
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:44,647
Aren't you worried about
these 15 people in that section?

1279
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:46,365
What are we gonna do with them?

1280
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:47,965
Um, you know what we do is
we open up this back room here.

1281
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:53,248
[I low-tempo music]

1282
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:19,161
- [music continues]
- [indistinct chatter nearby]

1283
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,207
[music continues]
