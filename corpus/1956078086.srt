[MAN]
I CAN SEE YOU.

2
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:18,744
SORRY.

3
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:20,979
IT WAS JUST ONE.
I SWEAR.

4
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:22,714
WHY HAVEN'T YOU LEFT
FOR THE REUNION ALREADY?

5
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:27,553
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST
STAY HOME TONIGHT.

6
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:29,054
IT'S GONNA BE GOOD
FOR YOU TO GET OUT

7
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:30,222
AND SEE ALL YOUR FRIENDS.

8
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:31,623
I HAVEN'T TALKED
TO ANYONE IN YEARS.

9
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:33,025
IT'S GONNA BE AWKWARD.

10
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:34,960
NO, IT'S NOT.

11
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:36,295
JUST PLEASE COME WITH ME.

12
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:38,097
I HAVE TO WORK.

13
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:41,266
I'M RUNNING THE COMPANY NOW.
EVERYTHING FALLS ON ME.

14
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:44,236
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO SCREW UP
YOUR FATHER'S LEGACY, DO YOU?

15
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:46,171
NO...

16
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,440
I DIDN'T THINK SO.

17
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:51,076
BUT I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL.

18
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:52,277
WHAT'S THAT?

19
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:53,812
I'LL GO TO THE NEXT ONE.

20
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:55,214
THAT IS FIVE YEARS FROM NOW.

21
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:57,449
WHAT'S GONNA CHANGE?

22
00:01:57,551 --> 00:02:01,687
[SIGHS]

23
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:18,871
WHAT'S MORE NOSTALGIC?
WALDEN OR EARLY BIRD?

24
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:19,771
PUT THAT AWAY TONIGHT.

25
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:20,873
[GRUNTS]

26
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:22,174
PLEASE.

27
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:23,475
WHAT IS THE POINT
OF ALL THIS?

28
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:24,643
DON'T YOU WANNA FIND OUT

29
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,912
WHAT ALL YOUR FORMER

MAX KLEIN.

35
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:41,827
JUST TOOK OVER HIS
FATHER'S USED CAR LOT.

36
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:43,028

CATS IN COSTUMES.

37
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,464
WEIRD.

38
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,232
SOCIAL MEDIA HAS RENDERED

39
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,468
THE HIGH SCHOOL REUNION
OBSOLETE.

40
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,402
HALF THESE PEOPLE MADE

00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,703
MY TEENAGE YEARS
A LIVING HELL.

42
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:53,205
I'VE GOT A GREAT JOB.

43
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,908
I GREW INTO MY NOSE.
LET ME HAVE THIS.

44
00:03:00,915 --> 00:03:03,315
DO WE REALLY HAVE
TO WEAR THESE?

45
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:04,349
YOU MIGHT.
YOU BLENDED.

46
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:05,350
I DID NOT.

47
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:06,685
YOU WERE VOTED

48
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:07,553
"MOST LIKELY TO MATCH
THE WALLPAPER."

49
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:08,687
I WASN'T VOTED ANYTHING.

50
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,489
EXACTLY. [LAUGHS]
NOW, COME ON.

51
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:12,824
I HAVE ENEMIES TO IMPRESS.

52
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,506
CAN'T BELIEVE I'M BACK
IN BATON ROUGE,

53
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,741
SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE
WHO DON'T CARE I EXIST.

54
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,243
IT'S LIKE I NEVER LEFT.

55
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:34,846
AT LEAST WE HAVE
ALCOHOL THIS TIME.

56
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:38,183
IS THAT KAREN?

57
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,152
[LAUGHS]

58
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:41,220
HEY.

59
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:42,721

SHE CAN USE A SAVE.

61
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,991
FAMILY EMERGENCY?

62
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:47,392
MM-MM.
TOO DRAMATIC.

63
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:48,393

BUT YOU'RE DOUBLE-PARKED.

68
00:03:57,471 --> 00:03:59,071
I AM?

69
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:00,939
AND THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER'S
WIFE JUST WENT INTO LABOR.

70
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:05,043

NICE MOVE.

75
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:17,055
THE PREGNANT WIFE
WAS A BIT MUCH.

76
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:18,190
YEAH.

77
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:19,157
SHE WENT OFF SCRIPT,

78
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,959
SO...

79
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:22,194

00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,667
NO, NO.
I JUST REMEMBER.

83
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:32,838
I SAT BEHIND YOU
IN ALGEBRA 2.

84
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,474
YOU USED TO DOODLE
COMICS IN YOUR TEXTBOOK.

85
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:36,908
I WOULD LOOK
OVER YOUR SHOULDER

86
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:38,010
AND READ THEM.

87
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:39,044
THEY HELPED
PASS THE TIME.

88
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:41,146
HAPPY TO HELP.
[LAUGHS]

89
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:42,848
SO, HOW LONG

90
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,883
I, UH, HAVE A 6:00 A.M.

WELL, NEXT TIME
YOU'RE IN TOWN,

93
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:52,891
YOU SHOULD LOOK ME UP.

94
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,430
PAUL BARNES.
REALLY?

95
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,132
YOU MARRIED THE PROM KING?

96
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:02,134
YOU WIN THE REUNION.
EVERYBODY GO HOME.

97
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:04,069
WAIT. I THOUGHT HE WAS
ENGAGED TO REBECCA DREIDER.

98
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,971
WEREN'T THEY SUPPOSED
TO GO TO YALE TOGETHER?

99
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:07,506
I HATED HER.
PLEASE TELL ME

100
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:08,974
SHE CRIED WHEN
SHE FOUND OUT.

101
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:11,109
NO. IT'S NOTHING
LIKE THAT AT ALL.

102
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:12,744
SHE'S ACTUALLY STILL
REALLY CLOSE TO PAUL.

103
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:13,812
SHE WAS AT OUR WEDDING.

104
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:15,614
SO,
WHERE IS HE TONIGHT?

105
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:16,715
HE HAD TO WORK.

106
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:17,983
I'M GLAD YOU MADE IT.

107
00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:20,152
ME TOO.

108
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:22,287
I REALLY MISSED YOU GUYS.

109
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,856
TO THE REUNIONS THAT
ACTUALLY MATTER.

110
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,658
HERE, HERE.
I'LL DRINK TO THAT.

111
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:36,001
I THOUGHT I'D FEEL
DIFFERENT COMING BACK HERE.

112
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:38,437
LIKE I'D FINALLY
FIT IN OR SOMETHING.

113
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:39,771
I DON'T KNOW.

114
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:42,541
I WAS SUCH A MESS
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

115
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,109
SWEETIE, NOBODY WAS
COOL IN HIGH SCHOOL.

116
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:45,677

LET'S TOTALLY HAVE

117
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,512

118
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,081
BUT THEY PEAKED EARLY.

119
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,615
ALL RIGHT. LET'S
COMMEMORATE THIS EVENING.

120
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:56,121
<i>GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO HOME,</i>

121
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:57,255
<i>BUT YOU CAN'T STAY HERE.</i>

122
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,362
BUT YEAH.
I'M A REPORTER.

123
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:05,364
WOW. A REPORTER.

124
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:06,932
I LIKE THIS ONE.

125
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,533
YOU NEED TO COME
VISIT US IN D.C.

126
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,102
OH. YOU TOTALLY SHOULD.
IT'S GREAT.

127
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,270
THERE ARE LIKE 50 PLACES
YOU CAN'T BRING A KNIFE.

128
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:14,072
OH,
I--I DO NOT FLY.

129
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:15,440
[LAUGHS]
NONE OF US CAN.

130
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,075
THAT'S WHAT
PLANES ARE FOR.

131
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:19,511
NO. I MEAN
I'M AFRAID OF HEIGHTS.

132
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:21,480
I WON'T EVEN DRIVE
OVER A BRIDGE.

133
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:23,815
NO, SERIOUSLY, I MAKE PAUL
SWITCH PLACES WITH ME.

134
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,150
DO YOU WANNA SHARE A CAB?

135
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:26,852
OH. THANKS.

136
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:28,820
HEY.
DON'T DRIVE.

137
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,489
I WON'T.
I PROMISE.

138
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:31,990
I'M GONNA--I'M GONNA
JUST CALL PAUL.

139
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,158
OKAY.

00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,192

00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,985
<i>CAN I CALL YOU A CAB?</i>

00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,653

I MIGHT BE SICK.</i>

153
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:02,721

159
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,431
<i>HMM.</i>

160
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,314
HOW DO I LOOK?

161
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,415
KIND OF SLUTTY.

162
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:31,983

A GOOD IMPRESSION.

164
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:34,386
CAN I BORROW THESE SHOES?

165
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:35,821
HEY, I THINK
KAREN AND PAUL

166
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:37,088
ARE HAVING PROBLEMS.

167
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:39,357
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU KEPT
IN TOUCH WITH HER.

168
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,959
YEAH. WE TALK A LOT
SINCE THE REUNION.

169
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,028
I DON'T THINK SHE HAS MANY
FRIENDS LEFT BACK HOME.

170
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,196
THAT'S BECAUSE
ALL THE COOL PEOPLE

171
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:45,297
GOT OUTTA THERE.

172
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,598
SAYS THE GIRL
BRINGING ME

173
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,666

174
00:07:47,768 --> 00:07:48,733
HEY.
WHEN IT'S A ROUNDTRIP,

175
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:49,701
IT'S NOSTALGIA.

176
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:50,902
YEAH.
WHATEVER.

177
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,004
HEY. LISTEN TO THIS
STATUS UPDATE.

178
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:56,641
"WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
THE TRUST IS GONE?"

179
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:58,376
THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.
I GUESS.

00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:08,873
OH. KAREN'S IN HAWAII.

355
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,575
YOU'RE SURE.
YEAH.

356
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:12,510
I HELPED HER
BUY HER PLANE TICKET.

357
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:13,744
MY MOM WORKS FOR AN AIRLINE.

358
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:15,880
SHE GETS REALLY
GOOD DISCOUNTS.

359
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:17,348
DID SHE HAPPEN
TO SAY WHY SHE LEFT

360
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,849
OR WHEN SHE'D BE BACK?

361
00:20:18,952 --> 00:20:20,918
NO. I GOT THE IMPRESSION

362
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,954
THAT SHE NEEDED TO GET AWAY.

363
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,690
IT'S BEEN
A REALLY TOUGH YEAR.

364
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:27,625
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

365
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,761
KAREN'S PARENTS REALLY
PRESSURED HER TO MARRY PAUL.

366
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:32,663
BUT I DON'T THINK SHE WAS

367
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,832
EVER REALLY
IN LOVE WITH HIM.

368
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:40,037
IT'S MY BOYFRIEND--
OR FIANCEE.

369
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:42,240
I GOTTA GET USED TO THAT.
YOU'RE ENGAGED?

370
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:45,142
YES.
OH! CONGRATULATIONS.

371
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,245
WHEN'S THE WEDDING?
OH, WE HAVEN'T SET A DATE YET.

372
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:49,280
JUST SEEMS LIKE THERE'S
SO MUCH TO DO BEFOREHAND.

373
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:51,382
I'M SURE.
YEAH, I SHOULD PROBABLY

374
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:52,817
CALL HIM BACK.
YOU NEVER KNOW

375
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,353
WHAT KIND OF TROUBLE
HE'S GOTTEN INTO.

376

IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU.

377
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,427
SO I WENT TO PAUL'S.

378
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:04,996

FOR YOU TO REALIZE

379

CALL YOU BACK EITHER.

NOT ALL OVER THIS?

384

TO, YOU KNOW, INVESTIGATE?

385
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:18,175
NO. SOME OF US KNOW HOW
TO CLOCK OUT OF OUR DAY JOBS.

386
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,845

TELL YOU WHAT I FOUND?

387

393
00:21:38,231 --> 00:21:40,564

00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:32,969
THAT I RUN.
AIRLINE?

527
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:35,806
THEY'VE BEEN POSTING PICTURES
TO THEM FOR THE PAST HALF HOUR.

528
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:37,974
POSTING WHAT?

529
00:34:47,019 --> 00:34:48,752
HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

530
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:50,520
LOOK AT THE ANGLE.
SOMEBODY HIJACKED

531
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:53,757
MY LAPTOP CAMERA.

532
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:58,061
THEY CAN DO THAT?

533
00:34:58,163 --> 00:34:59,496
I MEAN, YES. IT'S, LIKE,
THE EARLIEST FLIGHT

534
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,264
TO D.C. YOU HAVE.

535
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:03,300
YES, I'LL WAIT.

536
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:05,202
HEY. WE'LL FIGURE THIS OUT.

537
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:07,270
I COULD LOSE MY JOB
OVER THIS.

538
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:09,439
I PROBABLY ALREADY HAVE.

539
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:15,245
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
MY CREDIT CARD'S BEEN DECLINED?

540
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:21,084
WHAT IS GOING ON?

541
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:24,754
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
ANYBODY HOME?

542
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:28,191
HI. I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU
FOR MY NEW RINGTONE.

543
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:31,628
FOR WHEN I'M NOT THERE TO REMIND
YOU OF YOUR POOR LIFE CHOICES.

544
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,264
PUT ON A SHIRT.
I'VE GOT NEWS.

545
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:38,101
FOR YOU, THAT'S OPTIONAL.

546
00:35:38,203 --> 00:35:40,070
I SAW WHAT HAPPENED ONLINE.

547
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:41,872
I BROUGHT TEQUILA,
SO WE CAN EITHER

548
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:43,473
CELEBRATE YOUR
MENTAL BREAKDOWN

549
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:45,242
OR COMMISERATE
YOUR IDENTITY THEFT.

550
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:47,043
IT WASN'T ME.

551
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:48,578
I FIGURED.
YOU'RE NOT CARELESS.

552
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,147
FIVE DIFFERENT
NEWS AFFILIATES HAVE

553
00:35:50,249 --> 00:35:51,815
ALREADY PICKED UP
THE STORY, THOUGH.

554
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:54,017
AND I THINK CRUISING ALTITUDE
IS CURRENTLY TRENDING.

555
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:55,585
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

556
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:57,053
I HAVE NO IDEA.
YOU'RE THE ONE

557
00:35:57,156 --> 00:36:00,023
FLUENT IN INTERNET,
NOT ME.

558
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:07,130
THIS IS A DISASTER.
IT'S NOT ALL BAD NEWS.

559
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:09,766
I DID SOME DIGGING.
AND REMEMBER HOW WE THOUGHT

560
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:12,869
REBECCA WAS SUPPOSED
TO FOLLOW PAUL TO YALE?

561
00:36:12,971 --> 00:36:14,671
SHE WAS.
THE TWO EVEN HAD

562
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:16,840
AN OFF-CAMPUS APARTMENT
ALL LINED UP.

563
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:19,442
BUT AT THE LAST MOMENT,
HER ADMISSION GOT REVOKED.

564
00:36:19,545 --> 00:36:21,845
WHAT HAPPENED?
SOMEONE PHONED IN A TIP.

565
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:24,848
APPARENTLY SHE HAD HACKED INTO
THE COLLEGE BOARD'S DATABASE

566
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,884
AND CHANGED
HER S.A.T. SCORE.

567
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:29,186
SO WHAT? SHE HAD
A CERTAIN LIFE,

568
00:36:29,288 --> 00:36:31,288
AND NOW SHE'S TRYING
TO GET IT BACK?

569
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,523
SOME PEOPLE CAN NEVER GET OVER
THEIR SHOULD-HAVE-BEEN'S.

570
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,225
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

571
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:38,128
SHE USED TO SKIP COMPUTER LAB
TO WORK ON HER TAN.

572
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:41,264
MAYBE SHE HAD US
ALL FOOLED.

573
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:49,139
HI. I NEED TO SPEAK

574
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:50,740
TO REBECCA DREIDER.

575
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:52,475
MS. DREIDER HASN'T
COME IN YET.

576
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:54,010
DO YOU KNOW
WHEN SHE'LL BE IN?

577
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:55,445
I'VE BEEN INFORMED
THAT YOU'RE NOT

578
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,280
ALLOWED IN THE BUILDING.
AND IF YOU DON'T LEAVE,

579
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,216
I'M AFRAID I'LL BE FORCED
TO CALL SECURITY.

580
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:00,450
IT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT THAT
WE THAT WE TALK TO HER FIRST.

581
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,319
I'M CALLING SECURITY!

582
00:37:06,158 --> 00:37:07,991
IT IS. YEAH.

583
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:16,066
OH.

584
00:37:16,168 --> 00:37:17,968
OR NOT.

585
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:24,774
SO, WHEN'S LUNCH?

586
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:31,881
HEY! JESSICA?
DIANA--

587
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:36,486
WHAT'S WRONG?

588
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:38,154
THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

589
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:40,857
UM...

590
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:43,059
WHAT'S GOING ON?

591
00:37:43,161 --> 00:37:46,763
I WASN'T COMPLETELY HONEST
WITH YOU THE FIRST TIME WE MET.

592
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:50,400
KAREN DIDN'T ASK ME
TO BUY THAT PLANE TICKET.

593
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:52,802
PAUL DID.

594
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:54,504
I DIDN'T THINK
MUCH OF IT AT THE TIME.

595
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,940
I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS A GIFT
OR A SURPRISE OR SOMETHING.

596
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:58,775
BUT AFTER
WHAT YOU SAID LAST NIGHT,

597
00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:00,977
IT'S ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT.

598
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:05,949
IS HIM WITH HER.

599
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:12,622
HE NEEDS TO PAY
FOR WHAT HE'S DONE.

600
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:24,067
HI, PAUL. GOT A SEC?

601
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,978
I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR HERE, OFFICER.

602
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,447
WHERE'S THE CAMARO?
WHAT CAMARO?

603
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:38,815
THE ONE I SAW PARKED HERE.

604
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:41,318
THE ONE YOU'VE BEEN
USING TO RUN ME DOWN.

605
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,720
I DON'T OWN A CAMARO,
AND I NEVER HAVE.

606
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:49,292
IS THAT IT?

607
00:38:49,394 --> 00:38:52,462
MS. MILLS EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN
ABOUT YOUR WIFE'S SAFETY.

608
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:55,398
WHERE IS SHE CURRENTLY?
SHE'S IN HAWAII.

609
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,967
MAUI.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID SHE WAS IN OAHU.

610
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:01,738
IT'S A BIG ISLAND.
ACTUALLY, IT'S AN ARCHIPELAGO.

611
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,340
AND THAT'S NOT HELPING.
SORRY.

612
00:39:03,442 --> 00:39:04,874
DO YOU KNOW
WHEN SHE'LL RETURN HOME?

613
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:06,142
NO. I DON'T.

614
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:08,111
THAT'S BECAUSE
SHE'S NOT RETURNING.

615
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:11,281
SHE HAS NO IDEA
WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT.

616
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:12,849
ASK HIM WHY HE THREW
ALL OF HIS WIFE'S CLOTHES OUT

617
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:14,284
IN THE TRASH BIN OUT FRONT.

618
00:39:14,386 --> 00:39:17,420
YOU WENT THROUGH MY TRASH.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT, OKAY?

619
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,789
ACTUALLY, WHEN IT'S ON YOUR
PROPERTY, IT'S TRESPASSING.

620
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:23,593
BUT ONCE IT HITS THE CURB,
IT FALLS UNDER PUBLIC EASEMENT.

621
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:26,496
THAT IS CORRECT.

622
00:39:26,598 --> 00:39:28,765
MY WIFE AND I HAVE
BEEN GOING THROUGH

623
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,533
A ROUGH PATCH.

624
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:33,737
NOW, WAS IT IMMATURE?
WAS I ANGRY? PROBABLY.

625
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,538
BUT IT'S NOT ILLEGAL.
IS IT TRUE THAT YOUR WIFE HAS BEEN

626
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,173
OUT OF COMMUNICATION
FOR THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS?

627
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:38,875
NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL.

628
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:40,243
NO ONE HAS HEARD FROM HER

629
00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:42,011
SINCE THE SUPPOSED
"TRIP TO HAWAII."

630
00:39:42,114 --> 00:39:44,981
I HAVE. MANY TIMES.

631
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:47,083
DO YOU WANT ME TO CALL HER?

632
00:39:47,185 --> 00:39:49,085
YEAH.
FINE.

633
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:52,489

I NEED YOU TO--
<i>I'M NOT YOUR SWEETHEART.</i>

637
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:06,002
<i>DON'T EVER CALL ME AGAIN.</i>

638
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:07,703
SHE'S STILL MAD.
THAT'S NOT HER.

639
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:08,938
SHE WON'T CALL ME BACK.

640
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,774
THAT'S 'CAUSE
I'M HER HUSBAND,

641
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:13,510
AND YOU'RE HER STALKER.

642
00:40:13,612 --> 00:40:15,745

ALL WE NEED.

00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:34,497
ABOUT TIME.

00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:37,567
NICE CAR.

00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:39,369
SWEET RIDE, GIRL.

647
00:40:39,471 --> 00:40:42,172
THANKS.

648
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:07,931
DO YOU HEAR THAT?
HEAR WHAT?

649
00:41:08,033 --> 00:41:11,901
YOU MAY WANNA HAVE
A MECHANIC CHECK THAT OUT.

650
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:13,636
WHY DON'T YOU GO ON UP? IT'S
THAT FIRST DOOR ON THE RIGHT.

651
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:15,705
I'M GONNA TAKE A LOOK.
OKAY.

652

[MUFFLED SCREAMS]

653
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,197
QUIET. QUIET.

654
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,933
EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE OKAY.

655
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,238
AT LEAST YOU KNOW
YOUR FRIEND IS SAFE, RIGHT?

656
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,174
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.

657
00:41:51,276 --> 00:41:53,109
HOW CAN SHE BE IN HAWAII?

658
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:55,478
DIANA TOLD US PAUL
HAD HER BUY THE TICKET.

659
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,381
WHY WOULD SHE LIE?

660
00:42:13,532 --> 00:42:14,764
SHE SAID SHE WAS
THE BRIDESMAID.

661
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,700
SHE'S NOT HERE.

662
00:42:17,802 --> 00:42:19,602
SHE'S NOT ANYWHERE.

663
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:21,371
OH. MISSED CALL.

664
00:42:26,144 --> 00:42:29,279
<i>HEY, IT'S ME. I'M GOING TO GRB
A DRINK WITH DIANA TODAY.</i>

665
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:31,915
<i>YOU SHOULD COME IF YOU
FINISH YOUR INQUISITION.</i>

666
00:42:32,017 --> 00:42:34,284
<i>I JUST TEXTED YOU
THE ADDRESS.</i>

667
00:42:42,928 --> 00:42:45,028
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
HAPPENED TO KAREN?

668
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,462
TO BE HONEST,
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

669
00:42:46,565 --> 00:42:48,498
A COUPLE DAYS AGO,
I WOULD'VE SWORN SHE WAS

670
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,366
ON AN ISLAND SOMEWHERE
WITH A STRAW AND A COCONUT.

671
00:42:50,468 --> 00:42:52,869
BUT RECENT EVENTS
HAVE ME WONDERING.

672
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:54,971
RECENT EVENTS?

673
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:57,774
WELL, WE FOUND SOME THINGS.

674
00:42:57,876 --> 00:43:00,443
REALLY.
WHAT KIND OF THINGS?

675
00:43:00,545 --> 00:43:01,711
NO, I KNOW
SHE'S YOUR FRIEND.

676
00:43:01,813 --> 00:43:03,913
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO FREAK OUT, SO...

677
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:07,617
IT'S BEST FOR US
TO JUST THINK POSITIVELY.

678
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:10,420
SO, YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY PROOF?

679
00:43:10,522 --> 00:43:13,389
NO, I WOULDN'T
CALL IT PROOF EXACTLY.

680
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:15,491
WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU
CALL IT?

681
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:17,860
HEY, WHAT'S THIS?

682
00:43:17,963 --> 00:43:21,030
WELL, I GUESS YOU CAN SAY
I'M TECHNICALLY ALREADY MARRIED.

683
00:43:21,132 --> 00:43:23,967
MY FIANCEE, HE PROPOSED
TO ME WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

684
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:25,602
HE EVEN MADE ME
A RING OUT OF YARN.

685
00:43:25,704 --> 00:43:27,236
THAT'S ADORABLE.
YEAH. WE HAD

686
00:43:27,339 --> 00:43:29,172
A BACKYARD WEDDING
AND EVERYTHING.

687
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:35,178
AND HIS NAME'S PAUL TOO?

688
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,680
MM-HMM.

689
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:39,282
COULD I USE YOUR BATHROOM?

690
00:43:39,384 --> 00:43:40,683
YEAH.

691
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,885
IT'S THROUGH THAT DOOR,
DOWN THE HALL.

692

00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:46,916
SHE'S NOT ANSWERING.

695
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:48,351

01:00:45,209 --> 01:00:48,744
I LOVE YOU.
YOU TOO.

874
01:00:59,923 --> 01:01:02,491
HEY.
HEY.

875
01:01:02,593 --> 01:01:04,826
COME BACK TO BED.

876
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:08,997
I HAVE TO GO.

877
01:01:09,099 --> 01:01:12,000
AND SO DO YOU.

878
01:01:12,102 --> 01:01:13,635
I WOULD LOSE EVERYTHING.

879
01:01:13,737 --> 01:01:15,604
ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH HER?

880
01:01:15,706 --> 01:01:19,074
I LOVE YOU.

881
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:21,076
I'M GONNA FIGURE OUT
A WAY FOR US TO BE TOGETHER.

882
01:01:23,047 --> 01:01:24,980
I'D DO ANYTHING.

883
01:01:51,008 --> 01:01:53,709
WELL?
WHAT?

884
01:01:53,811 --> 01:01:56,812
WHAT'D YOU SAY TO HER?

885
01:01:56,914 --> 01:01:59,247
NOT MUCH.

886
01:01:59,349 --> 01:02:01,683
SHE KILLED YOUR WIFE.

887
01:02:01,785 --> 01:02:03,585
SHE DID US A FAVOR.

888
01:02:03,687 --> 01:02:05,921
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW
YOU CAN LOOK HER IN THE EYE.

889
01:02:06,023 --> 01:02:09,758
I JUST NEEDED CLOSURE.

890
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:12,094
WELL.

891
01:02:13,731 --> 01:02:17,499
DID YOU GET IT?

892
01:02:17,601 --> 01:02:19,434
YEAH.

893
01:02:19,536 --> 01:02:22,437
I THINK I'M READY
FOR MY FRESH START.
