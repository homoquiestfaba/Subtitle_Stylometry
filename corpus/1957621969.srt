1
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:15,221
(ominous music)

2
00:00:17,825 --> 00:00:20,787
(electricity buzzing)

3
00:00:33,103 --> 00:00:36,077
(tinkling music)

4
00:00:48,085 --> 00:00:51,125
(ominous music)

5
00:01:00,395 --> 00:01:04,237
(speaking foreign language)

6
00:01:07,004 --> 00:01:09,671
(tense music)

7
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:18,449
(speaking foreign language)

8
00:01:22,052 --> 00:01:22,787
(hammer bangs)

9
00:01:22,889 --> 00:01:25,852
(soft pop music)

10
00:01:36,098 --> 00:01:37,138
- Damn.

11
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,670
(putty thuds)

12
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:44,706
What the hell?

13
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,750
- [Man] You patch that hol?

14
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:57,752
- I'm working on it.

15
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:02,892
- Oh yeah, that always does it.

16
00:02:02,994 --> 00:02:03,792
- Why's that?

17
00:02:04,895 --> 00:02:07,333
- I've worked this unit every
year, and it's like clockwork.

18
00:02:07,435 --> 00:02:10,501
Tenants never stay long, and
that hole is always there.

19
00:02:14,072 --> 00:02:14,972
(lighter clicks)

20
00:02:15,074 --> 00:02:16,408
- We can smoke in here?

21
00:02:17,947 --> 00:02:19,908
- No, Chad, I can smoke in.

22
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:20,841
- Man.

23
00:02:22,046 --> 00:02:22,876
- Now listen.

24
00:02:24,017 --> 00:02:25,681
I did hear this story.

25
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:27,914
That cavity in the wal?

26
00:02:30,153 --> 00:02:31,225
It's alive.

27
00:02:33,156 --> 00:02:34,426
It's waiting.

28
00:02:37,127 --> 00:02:37,957
It's hungry.

29
00:02:39,596 --> 00:02:41,928
And if you stare at
that long enough,

30
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:45,837
it becomes a glory hol.

31
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:47,939
(both laughing)

32
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,839
- Man, stop playing with me.

33
00:02:49,941 --> 00:02:51,311
- Listen.

34
00:02:51,413 --> 00:02:54,980
Sun's down, scrape out the
damp, cover it with wallpaper,

35
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,246
and I'm not paying overtim.

36
00:02:57,348 --> 00:02:58,246
- I need at least another hour.

37
00:02:58,348 --> 00:03:00,286
- No, we'll do it tomorrow.

38
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,216
We need to drag this ot
a few more days anyway.

39
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:03,983
So just go home.

40
00:03:05,156 --> 00:03:05,990
You need a ride?

41
00:03:06,092 --> 00:03:06,890
- My girl's meeting me.

42
00:03:06,992 --> 00:03:08,194
- All right.

43
00:03:08,296 --> 00:03:09,058
Well, lock up before
you leave, all right?

44
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,363
- You got it, boss.

45
00:03:18,036 --> 00:03:20,538
(eerie music)

46
00:03:22,373 --> 00:03:25,279
Man, this is fucking bullshit.

47
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:28,579
(ominous music)

48
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:36,488
(tense music)
(Chad gasps)

49
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:41,757
What the fuck?

50
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:04,318
(tense music)

51
00:04:37,115 --> 00:04:38,352
- Hey, Mister.

52
00:04:39,415 --> 00:04:40,954
Sorry I'm late.

53
00:04:41,056 --> 00:04:42,521
- Look who finally showed up.

54
00:04:43,585 --> 00:04:44,924
- And look what I brought.

55
00:04:45,026 --> 00:04:46,525
- Is that a four-pack?

56
00:04:48,859 --> 00:04:51,159
- Two might've disappeared
on the way over here.

57
00:04:51,261 --> 00:04:52,564
- Yeah, sure.

58
00:04:53,867 --> 00:04:54,698
Thanks.

59
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,338
- Oh, wow.

60
00:04:59,073 --> 00:05:00,099
- That's cool, right?

61
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:03,443
- Hmm.

62
00:05:06,781 --> 00:05:07,612
- Okay.

63
00:05:10,247 --> 00:05:11,077
Wait, wait.

64
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,048
I got something for it.

65
00:05:18,057 --> 00:05:20,757
(tense music)

66
00:05:22,261 --> 00:05:23,762
- You got that for me?

67
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:24,963
- Yeah.

68
00:05:25,065 --> 00:05:25,960
Here, turn around.

69
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:33,904
Let me see.

70
00:05:34,006 --> 00:05:35,269
- Hmm.

71
00:05:35,371 --> 00:05:36,575
Do you like?

72
00:05:41,211 --> 00:05:42,042
- I love.

73
00:05:47,385 --> 00:05:49,753
And you need another beer.

74
00:05:50,859 --> 00:05:53,152
(Chad laughs)

75
00:06:00,796 --> 00:06:03,133
(glass shatters)
(tense music)

76
00:06:03,235 --> 00:06:06,099
(Lena groaning)

77
00:06:07,138 --> 00:06:08,167
- Lena?

78
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:11,577
Baby, you okay?

79
00:06:14,246 --> 00:06:15,143
(dramatic music)

80
00:06:15,245 --> 00:06:16,076
Lena!

81
00:06:17,214 --> 00:06:18,718
Lena!

82
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,019
Oh, fuck.

83
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:20,987
Stay with me, stay with me.

84
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:21,955
Look at me, look at me.

85
00:06:22,057 --> 00:06:23,252
Lena, baby, no, no, no, no.

86
00:06:23,354 --> 00:06:24,788
Help, somebody!

87
00:06:25,455 --> 00:06:26,727
Look at me, Lena.

88
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:28,024
Please help!

89
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:29,561
Oh, fuck!

90
00:06:29,663 --> 00:06:33,492
Okay, I'm gonna get help,
okay, I'm gonna get help.

91
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:36,096
(tense music)

92
00:06:46,915 --> 00:06:49,483
(solemn music)

93
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,151
- You're making a huge mistake.

94
00:07:39,498 --> 00:07:41,502
- She's a bad influence on you.

95
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,958
You step out that door,
don't come back to us

96
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:38,922
asking for help.

97
00:08:53,568 --> 00:08:54,608
- Kim!

98
00:08:56,307 --> 00:08:57,336
- Hey.

99
00:08:58,411 --> 00:09:00,179
- This place is lit, right?

100
00:09:00,281 --> 00:09:01,879
- So cool, I love the floor.

101
00:09:05,451 --> 00:09:07,016
- Where's your mom and dad?

102
00:09:08,554 --> 00:09:10,753
Still not a fan of mine, huh.

103
00:09:10,855 --> 00:09:12,890
- Not a fan of either
of us right now.

104
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:15,088
I'm just happy
you're here with me.

105
00:09:15,191 --> 00:09:16,991
- I'm just happy to
ride out your coattails

106
00:09:17,093 --> 00:09:19,426
when you become like,
a famous journalist.

107
00:09:20,196 --> 00:09:22,128
Or if I make it before
then, I'm gonna give yu

108
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,467
an exclusive article
on how fabulous I am.

109
00:09:25,569 --> 00:09:28,642
(both laughing)

110
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:39,983
(women chattering)

111
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:42,722
- Hi.

112
00:09:43,489 --> 00:09:44,856
- I like your hat, man.

113
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,189
- I'm Ronan, the landlord.

114
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,559
You're moving into
room 203, right?

115
00:09:51,661 --> 00:09:52,765
- That's us, yeah.

116
00:09:57,766 --> 00:10:00,707
(woman chuckles)

117
00:10:04,578 --> 00:10:06,647
This is the same
building, right?

118
00:10:07,647 --> 00:10:09,309
- This was an old
commerce building.

119
00:10:10,386 --> 00:10:12,014
The bank was on the first ,

120
00:10:12,116 --> 00:10:13,813
the other floors were
converted to apartments

121
00:10:13,915 --> 00:10:15,216
during the Depression.

122
00:10:16,153 --> 00:10:20,526
We take first, last,
plus damages, cash onl,

123
00:10:20,628 --> 00:10:23,059
for tenants like
you with no credit.

124
00:10:23,859 --> 00:10:25,094
That's how it's done.

125
00:10:28,831 --> 00:10:31,032
There's no parking included.

126
00:10:31,134 --> 00:10:34,902
No smoking, no loud
noise after nine p.m.,

127
00:10:35,004 --> 00:10:38,508
no cats, no dogs,
and the basement

128
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,879
is off limits to residents.

129
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:45,881
This is the last floor to be
renovated in the building.

130
00:10:45,983 --> 00:10:47,520
The other units on
this floor are empty,

131
00:10:47,622 --> 00:10:49,750
so it's just yours
here that's available

132
00:10:49,852 --> 00:10:51,285
and mine back over there.

133
00:11:11,106 --> 00:11:14,143
All original
pre-war furnishings.

134
00:11:15,045 --> 00:11:17,542
Utilities are included
in the monthly.

135
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:22,184
All furnishings are required
to remain in the apartment.

136
00:11:25,522 --> 00:11:26,760
- Wow.

137
00:11:27,392 --> 00:11:28,421
Oh my...

138
00:11:29,624 --> 00:11:30,423
Yes!

139
00:11:31,628 --> 00:11:33,030
This'll do.

140
00:11:33,962 --> 00:11:35,698
This will do just fine.

141
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,534
- It's better than the photos.

142
00:11:37,636 --> 00:11:39,237
Definitely vintage vibes.

143
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:40,040
You concur?

144
00:11:40,142 --> 00:11:41,137
- I concur.

145
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,438
(gentle music)

146
00:11:52,153 --> 00:11:53,483
Whoa.

147
00:11:53,585 --> 00:11:55,151
This is beyond.

148
00:11:56,251 --> 00:11:57,554
- It reminds me of
that messed up play

149
00:11:57,656 --> 00:11:59,155
that you did freshman year.

150
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:01,795
- "Murder at the Cathedral."

151
00:12:06,631 --> 00:12:07,801
- Don't touch that!

152
00:12:09,432 --> 00:12:13,206
This is an historic building,
and under no circumstances

153
00:12:13,308 --> 00:12:14,434
can that be damaged.

154
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:17,371
- Got it, dude.

155
00:12:19,512 --> 00:12:20,473
- Are we good here?

156
00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:26,149
(tense music)

157
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:44,563
(both laughing)

158
00:12:47,571 --> 00:12:48,809
- Yay.

159
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,603
(hammer tapping)

160
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,594
(ominous music)

161
00:14:23,603 --> 00:14:26,533
(knocking on door)

162
00:14:40,717 --> 00:14:41,955
- Hey.

163
00:14:43,456 --> 00:14:44,287
- Hey.

164
00:14:46,827 --> 00:14:48,219
She said this was
the only picture

165
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:49,655
where her hair looked nice.

166
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,336
- Her hair always looked good.

167
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:03,372
- Yeah.

168
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:08,707
(gentle music)

169
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,483
- I call wheelbarrow.

170
00:15:13,585 --> 00:15:14,245
- No.

171
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:15,787
- That was your mom's rules.

172
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:17,716
Sad girl goes in
the wheelbarrow.

173
00:15:22,727 --> 00:15:23,759
Wheelbarrow.

174
00:15:23,861 --> 00:15:26,626
(both chuckling)

175
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:29,094
Let's go!

176
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:32,071
(both laughing)

177
00:15:33,704 --> 00:15:34,733
Whoa!

178
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,806
- Blood surging to my head.

179
00:15:37,908 --> 00:15:38,742
(both laughing)

180
00:15:38,844 --> 00:15:41,247
(head thuds)
(gasps)

181
00:15:41,349 --> 00:15:42,180
- Sorry.

182
00:15:42,977 --> 00:15:44,017
Dang.

183
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:48,820
Fuck, I'm dizzy.

184
00:15:48,922 --> 00:15:50,718
Oh, you know what
I just remembered?

185
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,651
- What?

186
00:15:52,726 --> 00:15:54,153
- It's a margarita Thursday.

187
00:15:54,255 --> 00:15:56,394
- That's not a thing.

188
00:15:56,496 --> 00:15:57,123
- Why?

189
00:15:57,225 --> 00:15:58,498
I just made it a thing.

It's margarita Thursda.

191
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:01,231
- I can't.

192
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,663

(voicemail beeps)

218
00:17:36,895 --> 00:17:38,196
- Hey, it's me.

219
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:39,831
I just want to let you know
that we got all moved in

220
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,695
and the place is really good.

221
00:17:44,198 --> 00:17:45,303
And I'm happy.

222
00:17:47,374 --> 00:17:50,805
Okay, I'm gonna try again
tomorrow after my first day.

223
00:17:50,907 --> 00:17:51,738
Love you.

224
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,448
- Hi.
- Good morning.

225
00:18:01,717 --> 00:18:05,521
- I think I dreamt I peed
on the roof last right.

226
00:18:11,629 --> 00:18:14,530
- Wait, no, I think you did
pee on the roof last night.

227
00:18:15,836 --> 00:18:17,632
- Round two tonight, baby.

228
00:18:21,006 --> 00:18:22,636
That's not what I'm saying.

229
00:18:22,738 --> 00:18:25,306
What I'm saying is that
99% of college students

230
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:27,847
go to orientation
with a hangover.

231
00:18:27,949 --> 00:18:29,775
I think it's like
a rite of passage.

232
00:18:29,877 --> 00:18:32,784
- If I even look at tequila
tonight I'm gonna vomit.

233
00:18:32,886 --> 00:18:35,188
- Dude, just drink win.

234
00:18:35,885 --> 00:18:37,289
Ew!

235
00:18:37,391 --> 00:18:39,219
- I know, I tried to hang
the mirror there last night,

236
00:18:39,321 --> 00:18:40,685
but the nail didn't hold.

237
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,756
Found it on the
floor this morning.

238
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,229
Ew, it's fine.

239
00:18:48,331 --> 00:18:50,101
We'll just ask Ronan to fix it.

240
00:18:50,203 --> 00:18:53,734
- I think I see something.
(tense music)

241
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,872
- Izzy, don't, you know
you're just gonna mess it up.

242
00:18:56,974 --> 00:18:58,211
- No, hold on.

243
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:00,642
- Don't.
- Oh no, it's fine.

244
00:19:03,248 --> 00:19:04,516
(Izzy gasps)
(suspenseful music)

245
00:19:04,618 --> 00:19:05,915
- Izzy!

246
00:19:06,017 --> 00:19:08,848
(Izzy whimpering)

247
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,626
(Izzy laughing)

248
00:19:13,728 --> 00:19:14,253
- You're kidding!

249
00:19:14,355 --> 00:19:15,428
You're... (sighs)

250
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,490
Asshole.

251
00:19:16,592 --> 00:19:19,693
- I told you I was
gonna be a superstar.

252
00:19:19,795 --> 00:19:22,895
My pictures everywhere and
everyone knows my name.

253
00:19:24,368 --> 00:19:26,136
- Was that in the wall?
- Yeah.

254
00:19:26,238 --> 00:19:28,566
- Let me see it.
- Finders keepers.

255
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:30,637
- Well, I don't want to ke.

256
00:19:30,739 --> 00:19:32,040
There's probably mold
on it or something.

257
00:19:32,142 --> 00:19:33,410
- Oh, whatever.

258
00:19:33,512 --> 00:19:35,476
This is vintage, and Im
the queen of vintage.

259
00:19:35,578 --> 00:19:38,215
- Mm-hmm, more like
queen of tetanus.

260
00:19:38,317 --> 00:19:40,381
- That's a good one, actually.
- Thank you.

261
00:19:40,483 --> 00:19:42,050
- Get ready, we're
going out tonight.

262
00:19:42,152 --> 00:19:45,225
(ominous music)

263
00:19:58,735 --> 00:20:00,534
- Okay, so, your mom ad
dad, wouldn't let you

264
00:20:00,636 --> 00:20:01,873
hang in high school,
and then what?

265
00:20:01,975 --> 00:20:02,841
They disown you now, o?

266
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,238
- They don't disown me.

267
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,879
They're just really strict.

268
00:20:06,981 --> 00:20:09,207
- It's 'cause I went to rehab.

269
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:10,715
- Oh.

270
00:20:10,817 --> 00:20:12,148
Damn, well...

271
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,347
- Not for alcohol, you jackass.

272
00:20:14,449 --> 00:20:16,322
- Well, then for what?

273
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,824
- None of your
business, stranger.

274
00:20:19,926 --> 00:20:22,191
- My name is Steve.

275
00:20:22,293 --> 00:20:24,028
- Oh, well good for you, Steve.

276
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,591
- Anyway, we're roommates now,

277
00:20:25,693 --> 00:20:27,963
and I start at the
college tomorrow.

278
00:20:28,065 --> 00:20:29,300
- Okay, cool.

279
00:20:29,403 --> 00:20:30,933
All right, so you guys
are going to college.

280
00:20:31,035 --> 00:20:32,030
That's cool.

281
00:20:32,904 --> 00:20:33,735
- Not me.

282
00:20:35,506 --> 00:20:38,242
- Well, what are
you gonna do, then?

283
00:20:38,344 --> 00:20:39,911
- Oh, you know, just
probably thinking

284
00:20:40,013 --> 00:20:41,406
I'm gonna drink a lot here.

285
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:43,814
- She's an actress.

286
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:44,746
- Thanks babe.

287
00:20:48,755 --> 00:20:49,553
- Man.

288
00:20:51,123 --> 00:20:52,622
You're so fucking so hot.

289
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:55,022
- Don't.

290
00:20:55,124 --> 00:20:55,922
- What?

291
00:20:57,162 --> 00:20:58,695
- Dude, what are you doing?

292
00:20:59,764 --> 00:21:03,402
- Calm down, we're all just,
we're hanging out here, right?

293
00:21:06,905 --> 00:21:07,703
Bitch.

294
00:21:11,305 --> 00:21:12,205
- Shit.

295
00:21:12,307 --> 00:21:14,974
(Izzy laughs)

296
00:21:23,022 --> 00:21:25,886

299
00:21:48,048 --> 00:21:49,448
I'm sorry, we'll be quieter.

300

301
00:22:01,928 --> 00:22:04,295

302
00:22:04,397 --> 00:22:06,591
- You know, I didn't
tell you how much

303
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:08,060
that punch turned me o.

304
00:22:09,767 --> 00:22:12,497
- You know, we could
try something like that

305
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:14,104
if you want, huh?

306
00:22:14,206 --> 00:22:15,870
You can slap me or...

307
00:22:18,578 --> 00:22:21,381
Look, we don't have to
if you don't want, but...

308

309
00:22:29,052 --> 00:22:29,884

Holy shit.

316

(Kim breathing heavily)

317
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:06,948
What the fuck?

318

333
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:18,309
(Kim groaning)

334
00:27:18,411 --> 00:27:19,575
It's orientation day.

335
00:27:19,677 --> 00:27:21,681
I told you I wouldn't fail you.

336
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,885
(Kim sighs)

337
00:27:29,216 --> 00:27:31,389
- I heard some weird
noises last night.

338
00:27:31,491 --> 00:27:33,357
- Oh dude, I didn't hear shit.

339
00:27:33,459 --> 00:27:35,024
And that guy must've left.

340
00:27:36,296 --> 00:27:37,961
What's his name?

341
00:27:40,397 --> 00:27:41,296
- Tony?

342
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:42,234
- Tony!

343
00:27:42,336 --> 00:27:44,167
Dude, I totally forgot.

344
00:27:44,269 --> 00:27:45,100
But yeah.

345
00:27:47,505 --> 00:27:48,571
- How's your hand?

346
00:27:48,673 --> 00:27:52,440
- Oh, you know, it's all good.

347
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:55,172
(Kim chuckles)

348
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:57,411
- What time is it?
- It's only 11.

349
00:27:57,513 --> 00:27:58,379
- Shit!

350
00:27:58,481 --> 00:27:59,719
- What?

351
00:28:00,747 --> 00:28:01,787
- God.

352
00:28:02,488 --> 00:28:04,086
Orientation already started.

353
00:28:04,785 --> 00:28:07,485
(tense music)

354
00:28:26,178 --> 00:28:27,010
No!

355
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:29,377
(knocking on door)

356
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:30,877
Excuse me?

357
00:28:30,979 --> 00:28:33,117
I'm here for the orientation.

358
00:28:33,219 --> 00:28:34,050
Please?

359
00:28:35,783 --> 00:28:36,822
- You're late.

360
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,452
Orientation ended
15 minutes ago.

361
00:28:44,524 --> 00:28:48,129
I was giving the orientation
tour, so in exchange

362
00:28:48,231 --> 00:28:51,901
for an extra hot non-fat
sugar-free vanilla latte,

363
00:28:52,003 --> 00:28:55,467
I'll give you the
exclusive Ian tour for one.

364
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,276
- Really?

365
00:28:58,378 --> 00:28:59,207
That's your drink?

366
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,011
- Yeah.

367
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:02,742
- I'm kidding.

368
00:29:02,844 --> 00:29:03,882
You got a deal.

369
00:29:04,847 --> 00:29:06,181
- Need your name first.

370
00:29:07,154 --> 00:29:08,152
- Kim.

371
00:29:08,254 --> 00:29:09,553
- Ian.

372
00:29:09,656 --> 00:29:11,890
- I got that from the tour.

373
00:29:13,286 --> 00:29:14,826
- It's all about the web p.

374
00:29:14,928 --> 00:29:18,495
You'll access the live
lectures, round tables there.

375
00:29:18,597 --> 00:29:19,964
Has its own social network.

376
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:24,536
I'm not really giving
you any gold here.

377
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:26,432
You don't have to
write it all down.

378
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,740
What are you
majoring in, anyway?

379
00:29:28,843 --> 00:29:31,373
- Journalism, but I
want to minor in psych.

380
00:29:31,475 --> 00:29:32,374
- Nice.

381
00:29:32,476 --> 00:29:33,278
Yeah.

382
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,372
I'm a junior now.

383
00:29:34,474 --> 00:29:36,710
I'm doing journalism
too, but I'm focusing

384
00:29:36,812 --> 00:29:37,744
on video journalism.

385
00:29:37,846 --> 00:29:39,450
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

386
00:29:39,552 --> 00:29:40,545
Just it's the future.

387
00:29:41,482 --> 00:29:44,054
Information's become
democratized on the we.

388
00:29:44,686 --> 00:29:45,922
- Yeah.

389
00:29:46,024 --> 00:29:48,452
I think that's part of
the problem, though.

390
00:29:48,555 --> 00:29:50,289
I mean, any idiot with
an internet connection

391
00:29:50,392 --> 00:29:53,195
can take a video of
themselves and call it news.

392
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,300
- Touche.

393
00:29:55,402 --> 00:29:56,868
What about you?

394
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:00,472
- Call me romantic, but
I think there's something

395
00:30:00,574 --> 00:30:02,567
special about the written word.

396
00:30:04,475 --> 00:30:06,343
Like I...

397
00:30:06,445 --> 00:30:07,538
I don't know.

398
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,011
I think there's something
special about the process

399
00:30:09,113 --> 00:30:11,578
of real journalism,
and it helps people.

400
00:30:12,347 --> 00:30:13,952
- I hate to break it
to you, but that means

401
00:30:14,054 --> 00:30:17,453
you're gonna be taking a couple
courses with Dr. Phillips.

402
00:30:17,555 --> 00:30:18,918
- Is that bad?

403
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,025
- Dude is a complete ass.

404
00:30:22,189 --> 00:30:24,558
- He was must've given you a C.

405
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,461
- C minus.

406
00:30:25,563 --> 00:30:26,896
(Kim laughing)

407
00:30:26,998 --> 00:30:29,030
So you came here
for spring semester,

408
00:30:29,132 --> 00:30:31,165
and your friend came
to pursue acting?

409
00:30:31,267 --> 00:30:36,071
- Yeah, but we just
wanted to get away.

410
00:30:36,173 --> 00:30:38,636
I was being suffocated
by my mom and dad.

411
00:30:39,577 --> 00:30:40,407
But Izzy...

412
00:30:41,982 --> 00:30:44,883
She was struggling aftr
her mom passed away.

413
00:30:44,985 --> 00:30:49,317
So I wanted to help her,
and it kinda helps me too.

414
00:30:50,524 --> 00:30:51,924
She's like family, so.

415
00:30:53,456 --> 00:30:56,289
- There's a story for Dr.
Phillips' class right there.

416
00:30:56,392 --> 00:30:58,023
You could write about
how you help a friend

417
00:30:58,125 --> 00:30:59,525
cope with loss, you know?

418
00:31:00,628 --> 00:31:03,399
Anyway, you're lucky to have
a friend that's like family.

419
00:31:03,501 --> 00:31:04,601
- Yeah.

420
00:31:04,703 --> 00:31:06,605
It's cool. (chuckles)

421
00:31:06,707 --> 00:31:08,807
And we found this
amazing apartment.

422
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:12,406
I mean, it's amazing
and creepy, kind of.

423
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,112
But we can afford it, so.

424
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,615
- I've actually got ths
little protest today

425
00:31:19,717 --> 00:31:20,920
I'm gonna cover.

426
00:31:23,654 --> 00:31:25,622
(gentle music)

427
00:31:25,724 --> 00:31:27,025
See you on the portal.

428
00:31:29,525 --> 00:31:32,932
- Thanks for the in-person
lesson on isolated education.

429
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:51,843
(phone beeps)

430
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:52,945
- Hey.

431
00:31:53,047 --> 00:31:54,684
Just getting back.

432
00:31:54,786 --> 00:31:55,751
Haven't heard from you.

433
00:31:55,853 --> 00:31:57,088
Gonna go to bed soon.

434
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,630
(ominous music)

435
00:32:15,804 --> 00:32:16,635
Izzy?

436
00:32:18,973 --> 00:32:21,673
(door closes)

437
00:32:22,616 --> 00:32:24,676
Hey, what's with the smell?

438
00:32:26,848 --> 00:32:27,679
Izzy?

439
00:32:43,636 --> 00:32:46,302
(match strikes)

440
00:32:54,845 --> 00:32:57,676
(blows out match)

441
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,716
(object clattering)

442
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:56,273
(tinkling music)

443
00:34:10,756 --> 00:34:13,851
(keyboard clacking)

444
00:34:57,163 --> 00:34:58,866
Living...

445
00:34:58,968 --> 00:35:00,870
In the wake...

446
00:35:00,972 --> 00:35:03,241
Of an accidental overdose...

447
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:07,212
Doesn't always feel like l.

448
00:35:14,918 --> 00:35:17,486
(solemn music)

449
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:22,458
It's more like surviva.

450
00:35:24,726 --> 00:35:26,594
Like you've been kissed
by death and the shadow

451
00:35:26,696 --> 00:35:30,169
that looms in the aftermath is
a reminder that you're next.

452
00:35:33,702 --> 00:35:36,241
I watch helplessly as t
stalks my best friend.

453
00:35:39,042 --> 00:35:40,476
It has come close.

454
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:47,578
The shadow gave her
a fistful of pills

455
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,782
on a beautiful of
Fourth of July.

456
00:35:54,261 --> 00:35:56,695
But the subsequent fireworks
that burst inside her

457
00:35:56,797 --> 00:35:57,955
didn't finish the job.

458
00:36:01,466 --> 00:36:04,896
She refuses the call to
the other side, but...

459
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:12,244
The shadow is patient.

460
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:17,645
(mysterious music)

461
00:36:38,771 --> 00:36:40,899
(Kim sighs)

462
00:36:43,436 --> 00:36:46,377
(paper rattling)

463
00:36:50,916 --> 00:36:53,912
(suspenseful music)

464
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,758
(Kim breathing heavily)

465
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,020
What the fuck?

466
00:37:58,483 --> 00:38:03,685
(slow, heavy banging on door)
(tense music)

467
00:38:40,058 --> 00:38:41,692
(suspenseful music)

468
00:38:41,794 --> 00:38:42,354
Izzy.

469
00:38:42,456 --> 00:38:43,256
What are you doing?

470
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:46,123
(tinkling music)

471
00:38:47,032 --> 00:38:48,964
(ominous music)

472
00:38:49,066 --> 00:38:51,568
(gasps) Izzy!

473
00:38:57,008 --> 00:38:58,008
Hey, wake up.

474
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,807
Wake up, Izzy, please?

475
00:39:01,143 --> 00:39:02,108
I'm here.

476
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,041
It's okay.

477
00:39:05,315 --> 00:39:07,144
- She's still with us.

478
00:39:09,516 --> 00:39:12,457
(tinkling music)

479
00:39:13,124 --> 00:39:14,558
I can feel her.

480
00:39:18,325 --> 00:39:19,156
- Shh.

481
00:39:26,104 --> 00:39:29,034
(music box closes)

482
00:39:32,407 --> 00:39:35,073
(ominous music)

483
00:39:39,182 --> 00:39:41,981
(solemn music)

484
00:40:15,285 --> 00:40:18,215
(tools clattering)

485
00:40:22,027 --> 00:40:24,529
(Kim sighing)

486
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:34,132
Well, I had two
visitors last night.

487
00:40:36,439 --> 00:40:39,808
An imaginary bird, then you.

488
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,074
- Was the bird cute?

489
00:40:45,952 --> 00:40:46,914
Was I cute?

490
00:40:51,123 --> 00:40:52,315
I'm sorry, Kim.

491
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:54,856
I put the two and two together
when I woke up in your bed.

492
00:40:55,558 --> 00:40:57,991
But I don't remember anything.

493
00:41:00,197 --> 00:41:01,232
- Izzy, last-

494
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:02,699
- You liked your
smoothie, right?

495
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:07,405
- I like my sleep more.

496
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:09,841
- I used to sleep
walk when I was a kid.

497
00:41:09,943 --> 00:41:10,773
It'll stop.

498
00:41:12,643 --> 00:41:15,013
And if it doesn't,
you won't even know,

499
00:41:15,115 --> 00:41:16,548
'cause I installed a lock.

500
00:41:24,024 --> 00:41:26,789
(liquid pouring)

501
00:41:35,401 --> 00:41:37,195
- So what were you
up to last night?

502
00:41:38,533 --> 00:41:40,002
- I've met someone.

503
00:41:40,104 --> 00:41:41,137
- Hmm.

504
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:42,269
What's his name?

505
00:41:42,371 --> 00:41:43,201
- Her name.

506
00:41:45,309 --> 00:41:46,910
- Congratulations?

507
00:41:47,012 --> 00:41:48,140
- Sandy.

508
00:41:48,242 --> 00:41:51,977
Her name is Sandy, and I met
her last night at the bar.

509
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,052
She is a casting
assistant to this lady.

510
00:41:55,154 --> 00:41:55,950
And guess what?

511
00:41:57,788 --> 00:41:59,958
She's getting me an
audition for this TV show

512
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,017
that she's doing.

513
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,255
- Congratulations!
(Izzy laughing)

514
00:42:03,357 --> 00:42:07,196
- When I get the part, taking
you to your first strip club.

515
00:42:07,298 --> 00:42:09,132
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-hmm.

516
00:42:09,234 --> 00:42:11,867
(both laughing)

517
00:42:14,068 --> 00:42:16,801
- I was gonna tell you
about it last night,

518
00:42:16,903 --> 00:42:20,612
but I met someone too, a guy.

519
00:42:22,882 --> 00:42:23,714
Ian.

520
00:42:25,052 --> 00:42:26,077
And I like him.

521
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:29,315
I think I'm gonna let
him take me on a date.

522
00:42:29,417 --> 00:42:30,714
- What?!

523
00:42:30,816 --> 00:42:32,624
- Oh, are you okay?

524
00:42:33,389 --> 00:42:34,824
- Yeah, sorry.

525
00:42:36,222 --> 00:42:39,061
My cramps are really
kicking my ass today.

526
00:42:39,163 --> 00:42:40,224
- Okay.

527
00:42:40,326 --> 00:42:41,958
There's aspirin in the
cabinet over the stove.

528
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,295
Drink more water, less tequila.

529
00:42:45,401 --> 00:42:46,231
- Whatever.

530
00:42:47,971 --> 00:42:51,005
- The SPJ code of ethics
is a great place to start.

531
00:42:51,107 --> 00:42:54,073
You should always run through
the checklist to ensure that

532
00:42:54,175 --> 00:42:57,011
you are delivering your
content in a way that

533
00:42:57,113 --> 00:43:00,485
you're both proud of and that
will stand up to scrutiny.

534
00:43:00,587 --> 00:43:03,153
My office hours are
available as usual.

535
00:43:03,255 --> 00:43:04,782
Thank you, everyone.

536
00:43:04,884 --> 00:43:06,658
- Excuse me, Dr. Phillips?

537
00:43:08,093 --> 00:43:08,891
- Yes.

538
00:43:10,163 --> 00:43:11,955
- Yeah, I just...

539
00:43:12,058 --> 00:43:13,022
I wanted to ask a questiont

540
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:14,831
my personal experiences ar,

541
00:43:14,933 --> 00:43:18,065
because what I'm writing about
isn't technically about me,

542
00:43:19,299 --> 00:43:24,709
it's about my friend and
her personal experiences,

543
00:43:25,944 --> 00:43:28,142
some difficult situations and
how I've seen it affect her.

544
00:43:28,244 --> 00:43:33,652
And I think it'd be important
for me too, just be cathartic.

545
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:36,012
I'm not gonna say
her name or anything,

546
00:43:36,115 --> 00:43:37,750
but I was wondering if youk

547
00:43:37,852 --> 00:43:39,724
I need to get her permission.

548
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:42,725
- You should act
independently here.

549
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,690
As long as you aren't
putting her in any danger

550
00:43:44,792 --> 00:43:46,390
or betraying her trust.

551
00:43:47,534 --> 00:43:48,764
- Yeah, I just feel
it's important.

552
00:43:48,866 --> 00:43:50,862
I don't think she'd
understand right now

553
00:43:50,964 --> 00:43:52,671
what I'm trying to do with it.

554
00:43:54,607 --> 00:43:56,174
- As long as you
leave her anonymous,

555
00:43:56,276 --> 00:43:57,568
I think you'll be fine.

556
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:58,710
Good luck.

557
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:03,048
- Thank you, Doctor.

558
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:04,242
(computer beeps)

559
00:44:04,344 --> 00:44:06,044
I was just getting some
help from the professo.

560
00:44:06,146 --> 00:44:08,079
- So the audition's
today, and then

561
00:44:08,181 --> 00:44:10,253
Sandy's taking me
out for drinks after.

562
00:44:10,355 --> 00:44:11,890
- Casting couch.

563
00:44:11,992 --> 00:44:13,353
Nice.

564
00:44:13,455 --> 00:44:14,324
- Please.

565
00:44:14,426 --> 00:44:16,155
You should go see that boy.

566
00:44:16,257 --> 00:44:19,492
Give your mom and dad a big
fuck you by fucking him.

567
00:44:19,594 --> 00:44:21,825
(Kim chuckles)

568
00:44:21,927 --> 00:44:25,094
(ominous music)

569
00:44:25,197 --> 00:44:27,337
- All right, I'll see you .

570
00:44:27,439 --> 00:44:29,073
- Good luck, love you.

571
00:44:29,175 --> 00:44:30,071
- Love you!

572
00:44:33,542 --> 00:44:36,308
(gentle music)

573
00:44:52,529 --> 00:44:55,492
(hammer tapping)

574
00:45:08,741 --> 00:45:09,748
- Stay.

575
00:45:29,895 --> 00:45:31,296
(Kim laughs)

576
00:45:31,398 --> 00:45:34,866
So then she punched this
guy in the face. (laughs)

577
00:45:34,968 --> 00:45:36,841
I think he was knocked out.

578
00:45:37,808 --> 00:45:39,206
- Remind me not
to piss Izzy off.

579
00:45:39,308 --> 00:45:42,443
She sounds cool, I just don't
want to go down like that.

580
00:45:42,545 --> 00:45:44,843
(Kim laughing)

581
00:45:44,945 --> 00:45:46,411
How'd her mom pass awa?

582
00:45:48,247 --> 00:45:50,521
Sorry, I shouldn't
have asked that.

583
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:51,587
Sorry, it's the
journalism thing,

584
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:53,356
it's ruined my social etiq.

585
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:54,518
- No, no, it's fine.

586
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:57,125
She just...

587
00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:00,161
It was an overdose.

588
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:02,697
And the thing about
it was I think she was

589
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,294
the happiest person that I.

590
00:46:04,396 --> 00:46:07,970
I mean, I loved
Leanna, and I had just

591
00:46:08,072 --> 00:46:10,601
no idea that that's wht
she was going through.

592
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:14,076
And I think she was
going through that

593
00:46:15,045 --> 00:46:16,274
and she was just this
light in our lives,

594
00:46:16,377 --> 00:46:18,676
then what does that
mean for the rest of u?

595
00:46:18,778 --> 00:46:19,811
- Sorry.

596
00:46:19,913 --> 00:46:21,083
Just can't imagine.

597
00:46:22,014 --> 00:46:23,184
- It crushed Izzy.

598
00:46:24,383 --> 00:46:26,423
The worst part about
it is that I let

599
00:46:26,525 --> 00:46:28,187
my parents run my life.

600
00:46:28,289 --> 00:46:31,158
They wouldn't let me
over there to see her.

601
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:35,966
They thought I'd overdose
by osmosis or something.

602
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:39,464
So I couldn't go to the fu.

603
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,808
When she needed me
most, she called me

604
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:48,847
and asked me to be
there, I didn't show u.

605
00:46:52,312 --> 00:46:54,616
And then the next
thing that I heard,

606
00:46:54,718 --> 00:46:56,316
she was in the hospita.

607
00:46:57,819 --> 00:46:59,220
She tried to...

608
00:47:02,594 --> 00:47:03,895
She took a bunch of pills.

609
00:47:04,889 --> 00:47:05,930
So.

610
00:47:08,134 --> 00:47:11,969
I just promised myself that I
would always be there for her.

611
00:47:13,272 --> 00:47:14,305
Sorry.

612
00:47:14,407 --> 00:47:15,907
- Don't apologize.

613
00:47:22,314 --> 00:47:23,145
Come on.

614
00:47:25,617 --> 00:47:26,885
I'll take you for a ride.

615
00:47:27,718 --> 00:47:29,320
- You don't have a car.

616
00:47:29,422 --> 00:47:30,647
- Yeah, I know.

617
00:47:32,993 --> 00:47:36,590
When's the last time you
rode on a pair of handlebars?

618
00:47:36,692 --> 00:47:39,293
(Kim laughs)

619
00:47:43,864 --> 00:47:45,702
(Kim laughing)

620
00:47:45,804 --> 00:47:48,165
This is better
than a car, right?

621
00:47:48,268 --> 00:47:50,601
- It's kinda scary!
- I know.

622
00:47:51,709 --> 00:47:52,407
- How fast are we goin?

623
00:47:52,509 --> 00:47:53,069
- Fast!

624
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:54,377
Five miles per hour.

625
00:47:54,479 --> 00:47:57,080
(Kim laughing)

626
00:48:01,685 --> 00:48:04,582
- Woohoo! (laughing)

627
00:48:12,495 --> 00:48:13,294
Woo!

628
00:48:15,667 --> 00:48:17,468
- You almost got me killed.

629
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:19,971
- You almost got you killed.

630
00:48:20,073 --> 00:48:24,202
- I'd invite myself up, but
actually really sweaty now.

631
00:48:24,304 --> 00:48:26,540
- Good, 'cause I
would've said no.

632
00:48:26,642 --> 00:48:27,506
Go shower.

633
00:48:29,109 --> 00:48:30,410
- Can I see you again?

634
00:48:32,683 --> 00:48:37,956
- Uh-huh. (laughing)

635
00:48:40,657 --> 00:48:43,456
(door closing)

636
00:48:50,799 --> 00:48:53,400
(gentle music)

637
00:48:58,742 --> 00:49:01,639
(mysterious music)

638
00:49:11,589 --> 00:49:12,687
(door closes)

639
00:49:12,789 --> 00:49:15,994
(keyboard clacking)

640
00:49:31,573 --> 00:49:34,505
- [Samuel] Hello, you've
reached Samuel and Anne White,

641
00:49:34,607 --> 00:49:36,744
please leave us a
message after the tone.

642
00:49:36,846 --> 00:49:37,613
(voicemail beeps)

643
00:49:37,715 --> 00:49:39,444
- Hi, it's me again.

644
00:49:39,547 --> 00:49:43,421
I just want to tell you
how it's going here.

645
00:49:43,523 --> 00:49:45,390
I like my classes.

646
00:49:45,492 --> 00:49:46,651
We're doing good.

647
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,824
I guess call me back
if you have time,

648
00:49:50,926 --> 00:49:51,957
or want to talk,

649
00:49:52,059 --> 00:49:54,595
(glass shattering)

650
00:49:54,697 --> 00:49:55,431
Shit!

651
00:49:55,533 --> 00:49:56,364
Oh...

652
00:50:02,002 --> 00:50:04,034
(Kim sighs)

653
00:50:04,136 --> 00:50:07,045
(eerie music)

654
00:50:10,978 --> 00:50:13,579
(door opens)

655
00:50:15,246 --> 00:50:17,748
(door closes)

656
00:50:30,762 --> 00:50:32,803
- I had a really good
time with you today.

657
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:35,634
I really wanna kiss yo.
- Yeah?

658
00:50:36,808 --> 00:50:39,077
Well why don't you do it?

659
00:50:45,577 --> 00:50:50,781
(glass crunches)
(Kim grunts)

660
00:51:06,803 --> 00:51:09,470
(eerie music)

661
00:51:12,909 --> 00:51:15,872
(tinkling music)

662
00:51:35,195 --> 00:51:38,169
(tinkling music)

663
00:51:41,232 --> 00:51:42,272
- Izzy?

664
00:51:43,973 --> 00:51:46,705
(tinkling music)

665
00:51:58,887 --> 00:51:59,883
Izzy?

666
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:02,919
Hey.

667
00:52:03,926 --> 00:52:04,822
Are you okay?

668
00:52:08,227 --> 00:52:09,332
Are you awake?

669
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:13,303
(metal crunches)

670
00:52:14,806 --> 00:52:16,471
It's me, Kimmy.

671
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:19,170
Izzy?

672
00:52:19,272 --> 00:52:20,776
(Izzy screaming)

673
00:52:20,878 --> 00:52:22,106
Hey, are you...

674
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:23,547
(tense music)

675
00:52:23,649 --> 00:52:25,010
(Kim gasps)

676
00:52:25,112 --> 00:52:27,650
Izzy, wait.

677
00:52:27,752 --> 00:52:30,254
(door closes)

678
00:52:31,955 --> 00:52:34,756
(elevator beeps)

679
00:52:34,858 --> 00:52:39,263
Fuck. (groans)

680
00:52:42,998 --> 00:52:45,401
(door opens)

681
00:52:48,003 --> 00:52:50,505
(door closes)

682
00:52:57,717 --> 00:53:00,647
(mysterious music)

683
00:53:03,083 --> 00:53:03,881
Izzy?

684
00:53:07,792 --> 00:53:08,822
Izzy, please?

685
00:53:08,924 --> 00:53:09,722
It's me.

686
00:53:36,887 --> 00:53:38,014
Izzy, please.

687
00:53:39,287 --> 00:53:40,819
Please, where are you?

688
00:54:11,756 --> 00:54:12,521
Izzy?

689
00:54:13,286 --> 00:54:15,986
(tense music)

690
00:54:23,267 --> 00:54:28,471
(Kim gasps)
(person choking)

691
00:54:39,181 --> 00:54:42,353
(tinkling music)

692
00:54:43,249 --> 00:54:44,080
Izzy?

693
00:54:46,221 --> 00:54:49,360
(person choking)

694
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:53,364
Izzy, where are you going?

695
00:54:54,462 --> 00:54:57,800
Izzy, wait!
(door closes)

696
00:54:57,902 --> 00:55:00,404
(tense music)

697
00:55:03,502 --> 00:55:06,476
(tinkling music)

698
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:13,780
(ominous music)

699
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:40,940
Hey.

700
00:55:41,042 --> 00:55:42,305
Hey.

701
00:55:42,407 --> 00:55:43,447
Izzy.

702
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:49,986
It's okay.

703
00:55:50,088 --> 00:55:52,285
It's all right, Izzy.

704
00:55:52,387 --> 00:55:54,150
You're gonna be safe.

705
00:55:57,158 --> 00:55:57,989
Okay.

706
00:55:59,163 --> 00:56:01,763
You're gonna be all right.

707
00:56:01,865 --> 00:56:02,697
Shh.

708
00:56:03,632 --> 00:56:08,703
(suspenseful music)
(Izzy groaning)

709
00:56:09,637 --> 00:56:13,402
(urine trickling)
(solemn music)

710
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:14,544
I'm here.

711
00:56:17,915 --> 00:56:18,746
I'm here.

712
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:37,193
- I don't understand.

713
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,504
- It's okay.

714
00:56:41,703 --> 00:56:44,269
I think you just
need to stay in bed.

715
00:56:44,371 --> 00:56:45,674
You need rest.

716
00:56:46,606 --> 00:56:48,039
And please don't drink.

717
00:56:49,879 --> 00:56:53,247
I don't know what that was
last night, but it scared me.

718
00:56:53,349 --> 00:56:55,953
- I'm not gonna drink.

719
00:56:56,055 --> 00:56:58,085
I have a call back today.

720
00:56:58,187 --> 00:56:59,215
- Drink this.

721
00:57:07,429 --> 00:57:09,731
- My head really hurts.

722
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:13,163
- I think it might
just be stress.

723
00:57:15,338 --> 00:57:17,337
Can you see a doctor?

724
00:57:17,439 --> 00:57:18,905
- I don't have insurance.

725
00:57:19,875 --> 00:57:22,078
And like, I don't know,
but they're not gonna

726
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,609
let me take sleeping pills.

727
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:25,113
- No, that's not
what I was saying.

728
00:57:25,215 --> 00:57:26,176
I don't want that.

729
00:57:34,186 --> 00:57:38,160
- Do you ever feel like
you're watching your dreams,

730
00:57:38,262 --> 00:57:39,893
but you're not part of them?

731
00:57:43,429 --> 00:57:44,260
- No.

732
00:57:48,505 --> 00:57:50,233
- Well, that's
what it felt like.

733
00:57:51,207 --> 00:57:54,006
(solemn music)

734
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:02,448
- [Kim] I feel like
I'm talking crazy.

735
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:04,283
- No, no, you're not.

736
00:58:04,385 --> 00:58:05,751
This is real.

737
00:58:05,853 --> 00:58:08,119
You weren't sleepwalking,
you were awake.

738
00:58:09,161 --> 00:58:10,687
- Well, what do I do?

739
00:58:10,789 --> 00:58:12,222
I need to do something.

740
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:15,599
- Dig.

741
00:58:16,462 --> 00:58:17,834
- What?

742
00:58:17,936 --> 00:58:18,761
- Dig.

743
00:58:18,863 --> 00:58:20,030
Research, investigate.

744
00:58:20,132 --> 00:58:22,197
That's what we're
supposed to do, right?

745
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:25,171
There's always an answer,
you just have to dig.

746
00:58:25,273 --> 00:58:26,238
- Right.

747
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,375
Yeah.

748
00:58:27,478 --> 00:58:29,780
- Just can't judge what we.

749
00:58:29,882 --> 00:58:31,008
- We?

750
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:33,584
- You'll need like a
research assistant.

751
00:58:38,788 --> 00:58:41,016
- Will you come to
the apartment with me?

752
00:58:41,118 --> 00:58:42,956
- Finally, you're
inviting me up.

753
00:58:46,126 --> 00:58:48,090
- Just don't talk to hr
about it though, pleas.

754
00:58:48,192 --> 00:58:49,932
I just want you to
see the place first.

755
00:58:50,034 --> 00:58:52,701
Maybe there's like
radon poisoning
happening or something.

756
00:58:52,803 --> 00:58:54,203
- I don't think radon makes
you sleepwalk yourself

757
00:58:54,305 --> 00:58:55,203
down to the basement.

758
00:58:55,305 --> 00:58:56,974
- What the hell?

759
00:58:57,076 --> 00:58:59,742
(ominous music)

760
00:59:18,228 --> 00:59:19,964
- Is she gone?

761
00:59:20,066 --> 00:59:24,364
- I don't know.

762
00:59:24,466 --> 00:59:27,268
(dramatic music)

763
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:28,270
- Can I help you?

764
00:59:28,372 --> 00:59:29,304
- Do you know this guy?

765
00:59:29,406 --> 00:59:30,641
- [Kim] He's my landlord.

766
00:59:32,772 --> 00:59:34,304
- I came to treat the glass.

767
00:59:36,081 --> 00:59:37,141
- Oh, okay.

768
00:59:37,243 --> 00:59:39,215
Can you let me know in
advance when you're gonna be

769
00:59:39,317 --> 00:59:40,778
coming into the apartment?

770
00:59:40,881 --> 00:59:42,686
- You went down to the bas.

771
00:59:44,557 --> 00:59:47,284
The basement is off
limits to residents.

772
00:59:48,787 --> 00:59:50,287
Don't go down there.

773
01:00:02,166 --> 01:00:05,241
- Your landlord's
kind of a dick.

774
01:00:05,343 --> 01:00:08,409
- Yeah.
(door closes)

775
01:00:08,511 --> 01:00:10,747
- This thing is horrifying.

776
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:14,316
You ever seen stained
glass like this?

777
01:00:14,418 --> 01:00:15,752
- No.
- Me neither.

778
01:00:20,885 --> 01:00:23,925
(camera clicking)

779
01:00:36,103 --> 01:00:37,601
- Last night Izzy was
just staring at it.

780
01:00:37,703 --> 01:00:38,938
It was weird.

781
01:00:39,041 --> 01:00:41,244
It was like she was
hypnotized or somethin.

782
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,910
- That symbol is weird.

783
01:00:43,012 --> 01:00:46,948
It looks like kinda Irish
or Celtic or something.

784
01:00:49,285 --> 01:00:50,083
- Hmm.

785
01:00:52,421 --> 01:00:53,387
- What else?

786
01:00:53,489 --> 01:00:54,854
- What else what?

787
01:00:54,956 --> 01:00:56,726
- You said she was
holding a music box?

788
01:00:56,828 --> 01:00:59,696
- Yeah, I found it in that
little cabinet over there.

789
01:00:59,798 --> 01:01:01,793
All the stuff is just
like stuff left behind.

790
01:01:01,895 --> 01:01:03,297
- From other renters or what?

791
01:01:03,399 --> 01:01:04,397
- I think so.

792
01:01:04,499 --> 01:01:05,333
I don't know.

793
01:01:05,435 --> 01:01:07,705
One second. (laughs)

794
01:01:14,445 --> 01:01:16,472
- [Ian] Look at these.

795
01:01:18,416 --> 01:01:19,717
This is the music box?

796
01:01:21,218 --> 01:01:22,485
- Yeah.

797
01:01:22,587 --> 01:01:24,616
- It's not making
any music sounds.

798
01:01:24,718 --> 01:01:26,053
- It was last night.

799
01:01:27,492 --> 01:01:29,419
I'm not crazy, it was, I swear.

800
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:35,997
- To my dearest Karen,
always yours, L.M..

801
01:01:37,532 --> 01:01:40,232
(door closes)

802
01:01:46,443 --> 01:01:47,503
- Hey, I'm Ian.

803
01:01:48,476 --> 01:01:49,505
- Hey.

804
01:01:51,075 --> 01:01:52,409
- How's your call back?

805
01:01:54,379 --> 01:01:56,947
- Sandy didn't even
show up, so I guess

806
01:01:57,049 --> 01:01:58,448
it kinda just went like that.

807
01:01:59,687 --> 01:02:00,483
- I'm sorry, hon.

808
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:03,460
I'm sure it went better
than you think it did.

809
01:02:03,562 --> 01:02:05,691
And there's always
gonna be more.

810
01:02:05,793 --> 01:02:07,126
- There is gonna be more.

811
01:02:07,228 --> 01:02:10,197
I get another chance to
get rejected tomorrow.

812
01:02:10,299 --> 01:02:11,334
So.

813
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,736
- My sister's an actress.

814
01:02:12,838 --> 01:02:15,432
They made her be the spoon
in "Beauty and the Beast."

815
01:02:16,471 --> 01:02:17,302
- Spoon.

816
01:02:18,441 --> 01:02:19,469
That's great.

817
01:02:23,214 --> 01:02:24,045
- Sorry.

818
01:02:29,387 --> 01:02:31,013
(camera clicking)

819
01:02:31,115 --> 01:02:32,748
Why don't you cover that up?

820
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:33,890
- I tried.

821
01:02:35,526 --> 01:02:36,521
- Smells kinda weird.

822
01:02:36,623 --> 01:02:37,959
- I know.

823
01:02:38,061 --> 01:02:41,392
And the necklace that
Izzy found was in ther.

824
01:02:42,563 --> 01:02:43,565
- What?

825
01:02:43,667 --> 01:02:45,803
Out of the hole?
- Yeah.

826
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:49,499
She just reached her hand
in there and found it.

827
01:02:51,542 --> 01:02:53,775
- Okay, but that's gross.

828
01:02:53,877 --> 01:02:56,011
Does Izzy eat gum
off the sidewalk too?

829
01:02:57,314 --> 01:02:58,145
- Shut up.

830
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:01,549
No, no, really,
that's fucking crazy.

831
01:03:01,651 --> 01:03:03,419
Why would that be in there?

832
01:03:03,521 --> 01:03:04,580
Why would you wear it?

833
01:03:06,686 --> 01:03:07,552
Okay.

834
01:03:07,654 --> 01:03:08,454
Moving on.

835
01:03:08,556 --> 01:03:09,991
All right.

836
01:03:10,093 --> 01:03:12,725
I'll look into anything
I can find on the window.

837
01:03:12,827 --> 01:03:14,659
You look into the apartment.

838
01:03:14,761 --> 01:03:17,366
(solemn music)

839
01:03:17,468 --> 01:03:20,233
(zipper buzzing)

840
01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:28,175
(keyboard clacking)

841
01:03:33,752 --> 01:03:35,517
Okay, this is definitey
a Celtic mark,

842
01:03:35,619 --> 01:03:36,552
it's called a triskele.

843
01:03:36,654 --> 01:03:38,856
It's like a druid pagan symbol.

844
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:40,957
- Hmm.

845
01:03:51,798 --> 01:03:53,101
Liam McNally.

846
01:03:55,571 --> 01:03:56,401
Look at this.

847
01:03:58,805 --> 01:03:59,906
It's Karen.

848
01:04:00,008 --> 01:04:02,244
It's the name from
the music box.

849
01:04:02,346 --> 01:04:03,177
- L.M..

850
01:04:03,876 --> 01:04:04,943
That's crazy.

851
01:04:05,045 --> 01:04:06,811
That's their music box, right?

852
01:04:06,913 --> 01:04:07,951
- It has to be.

853
01:04:10,015 --> 01:04:13,121
(keyboard clacking)

854
01:04:15,293 --> 01:04:16,124
- Damn.

855
01:04:17,329 --> 01:04:18,159
Look at this.

856
01:04:21,064 --> 01:04:23,593
- "Bank manager
murders pregnant wife."

857
01:04:25,402 --> 01:04:26,365
Jesus.

858
01:04:30,067 --> 01:04:31,436
Milton Briggs.

859
01:04:40,177 --> 01:04:43,481
(keyboards clacking)

860
01:04:47,058 --> 01:04:51,027
"He was last known to
be in his apartment..."

861
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:52,622
203.

862
01:04:58,803 --> 01:05:00,664
They all lived in
this apartment?

863
01:05:01,567 --> 01:05:04,337
- I don't know, some of
the articles don't say.

864
01:05:20,821 --> 01:05:23,587
(solemn music)

865
01:05:40,578 --> 01:05:43,313
(Kim chuckling)

866
01:05:43,415 --> 01:05:46,615
(tense music)

867
01:05:46,717 --> 01:05:50,618
(Izzy breathing heavil)

868
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:53,950
(eerie chanting)

869
01:05:54,052 --> 01:05:55,424
(tense music)

870
01:05:55,526 --> 01:05:58,094
(Izzy panting)

871
01:06:00,865 --> 01:06:05,398
(woman whispering
foreign language)

872
01:06:09,903 --> 01:06:12,636
(Izzy panting)

873
01:06:14,307 --> 01:06:15,642
(woman whispering
foreign language)

874
01:06:15,744 --> 01:06:18,510
(Izzy gasping)

875
01:06:22,819 --> 01:06:26,821
(Izzy hyperventilating)

876
01:06:26,924 --> 01:06:31,193
(voices whispering indisti)

877
01:06:32,761 --> 01:06:34,797
(Izzy gasps)

878
01:06:34,899 --> 01:06:39,095
(woman whispering
foreign language)

879
01:06:39,197 --> 01:06:42,072
(ominous music)

880
01:06:52,851 --> 01:06:58,055
(paper rustling)
(Kim sighs)

881
01:06:58,656 --> 01:07:01,421
(paper rustling)

882
01:07:03,122 --> 01:07:06,327
(suspenseful music)

883
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:21,874
(bird caws)

884
01:07:21,976 --> 01:07:23,677
- What happened?

885
01:07:23,779 --> 01:07:25,312
Are you okay?

886
01:07:25,414 --> 01:07:27,077
- There was this bird,
there was a fucking bid

887
01:07:27,179 --> 01:07:28,550
and it flew at me.

888
01:07:28,652 --> 01:07:31,154
(tense music)

889
01:07:33,187 --> 01:07:35,457
- It's just a dream, all right?

890
01:07:35,559 --> 01:07:36,390
It's okay.

891
01:07:40,731 --> 01:07:43,628
(mysterious music)

892
01:07:58,077 --> 01:07:59,045
(door closes)

893
01:07:59,148 --> 01:08:00,150
- Can I help you with some?

894
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:02,449
- Excuse me.

895
01:08:04,755 --> 01:08:06,123
Are you Kim White?

896
01:08:07,857 --> 01:08:08,755
- I'm her roommate.

897
01:08:08,857 --> 01:08:09,687
- Okay, great.

898
01:08:10,388 --> 01:08:11,788
Here.
- Thank you.

899
01:08:18,966 --> 01:08:19,764
(door closes)

900
01:08:19,866 --> 01:08:20,896
Kim?

901
01:08:23,709 --> 01:08:25,373
Kim, I got your paper.

902
01:08:31,780 --> 01:08:32,611
Oh, fuck.

903
01:08:45,289 --> 01:08:47,857
(solemn music)

904
01:08:56,905 --> 01:08:59,539
(doors open)

905
01:09:02,944 --> 01:09:05,644
(doors close)

906
01:09:16,991 --> 01:09:19,490
(phone beeps)

907
01:09:19,592 --> 01:09:21,792
- I'm just here in
St. Mark's Cathedral.

908
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:25,464
As a lifelong atheist, I
don't have much experience

909
01:09:25,566 --> 01:09:28,697
with stained glass
windows, so I wanted to see

910
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:31,337
these in person,
make some comparisons

911
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:32,669
between the windows
in the church

912
01:09:32,772 --> 01:09:34,304
and the stained glass
window in Kim's apartment

913
01:09:34,406 --> 01:09:35,839
at the commerce building.

914
01:09:37,744 --> 01:09:41,284
So far, what I'm seeing
here are depictions

915
01:09:41,386 --> 01:09:45,585
of religious events, you know,
probably biblical symbolism.

916
01:09:47,354 --> 01:09:49,051
Or they're totally decorative.

917
01:09:49,854 --> 01:09:52,723
Either way, the tone
is about reverence.

918
01:09:52,825 --> 01:09:56,497
They're generally uplifting,
and generally pretty.

919
01:09:58,334 --> 01:10:00,598
In contrast to the
window in room 203,

920
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:04,906
I don't see any maker's
marks or symbols

921
01:10:05,008 --> 01:10:06,606
that appear to be Celtic.

922
01:10:08,845 --> 01:10:11,347
(phone beeps)

923
01:10:32,803 --> 01:10:35,305
(tense music)

924
01:10:50,756 --> 01:10:53,653
(mysterious music)

925
01:11:09,169 --> 01:11:10,674
(door opens)

926
01:11:10,776 --> 01:11:13,508
(car door closes)

927
01:11:19,179 --> 01:11:21,978
(solemn music)

928
01:11:42,137 --> 01:11:45,067
(knocking on door)

929
01:11:48,208 --> 01:11:51,075
(door opening)

930
01:11:51,177 --> 01:11:51,913
- Hi.

931
01:11:52,015 --> 01:11:53,011
Can I help you?

932
01:11:53,113 --> 01:11:53,982
- Hi.

933
01:11:54,084 --> 01:11:55,745
Are, are you Milton Briggs?

934
01:11:55,847 --> 01:11:59,783
- When I can remember
my own name I am.

935
01:11:59,885 --> 01:12:02,551
Did I forget to pay
a bill or something?

936
01:12:02,653 --> 01:12:04,658
- No, no, nothing like that.

937
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:07,859
I go to college here
and I'm actually doing

938
01:12:07,961 --> 01:12:10,595
some research for an article,
and I was just wondering

939
01:12:10,697 --> 01:12:12,094
if I could talk to
you for five minutes

940
01:12:12,196 --> 01:12:17,033
about Liam and Karen McNally
and the night that they died.

941
01:12:18,443 --> 01:12:20,509
- Why would you want to
write an article about that?

942
01:12:21,645 --> 01:12:24,773
They've already wrote everything
there is to say already.

943
01:12:24,875 --> 01:12:28,077
- I just wanted to
hear it from you.

944
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:34,487
- I haven't had to talk
about that in about 50 years.

945
01:12:34,589 --> 01:12:36,087
I don't want to
dredge up the past.

946
01:12:36,189 --> 01:12:37,826
- Please.

947
01:12:37,928 --> 01:12:38,989
Five minutes.

948
01:12:40,092 --> 01:12:45,099
I live in that same apartment,
and I just need to know.

949
01:12:45,201 --> 01:12:46,601
- You live in room 203.

950
01:12:49,202 --> 01:12:50,033
- Yes.

951
01:12:52,938 --> 01:12:55,170
- That night I was
working the graveyard,

952
01:12:56,113 --> 01:12:58,008
and I heard some footsteps.

953
01:13:00,682 --> 01:13:03,880
I figured it was Larry,
the other janitor,

954
01:13:03,983 --> 01:13:07,356
had come back 'cause
he had forgot his keys,

955
01:13:07,459 --> 01:13:11,789
but then I heard more
footsteps, and crying.

956
01:13:11,892 --> 01:13:14,728
So I stepped out to
see what was happening.

957
01:13:15,693 --> 01:13:17,192
And that's when I saw him.

958
01:13:19,337 --> 01:13:21,504
Chasing his wife
into the boiler room.

959
01:13:23,137 --> 01:13:24,166
- Who?

960
01:13:26,603 --> 01:13:28,272
- Mr. McNally.

961
01:13:28,374 --> 01:13:30,045
(tense music)

962
01:13:30,147 --> 01:13:31,514
He was after his wife.

963
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:34,914
And she was screaming.

964
01:13:35,917 --> 01:13:40,815
So I ran after them and chased
them into the boiler room,

965
01:13:40,951 --> 01:13:43,724
and that's when I saw the .

966
01:13:45,623 --> 01:13:46,661
- Blood on who?

967
01:13:51,431 --> 01:13:52,699
- Mrs. McNally.

968
01:13:52,801 --> 01:13:57,507
She was clutching her
stomach and crying out.

969
01:13:59,637 --> 01:14:01,005
It was everywhere.

970
01:14:02,344 --> 01:14:04,140
And then the crying stopped.

971
01:14:08,118 --> 01:14:09,178
And I just froze.

972
01:14:10,588 --> 01:14:14,018
I've never been so ashamed
of anything in my life.

973
01:14:18,824 --> 01:14:22,230
I stood there, and
when he got up,

974
01:14:22,332 --> 01:14:25,194
he just walked right past me.

975
01:14:26,835 --> 01:14:29,902
He had a look in his eyes
I'd never seen in a man.

976
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:37,272
It was like I wasn't even .

977
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:39,912
Like I was a ghost.

978
01:14:40,814 --> 01:14:43,813
I felt like I
floated Mrs. McNally.

979
01:14:43,915 --> 01:14:45,815
I just wanted to
stop the bleeding.

980
01:14:45,917 --> 01:14:48,217
All of a sudden,
I heard a gunshot.

981
01:14:49,324 --> 01:14:50,219
- He shot himself?

982
01:14:52,556 --> 01:14:53,728
- I guess.

983
01:14:54,761 --> 01:14:56,995
I couldn't think
of what that was.

984
01:14:58,469 --> 01:15:01,031
My mind just wasn't
ready for it yet.

985
01:15:01,133 --> 01:15:04,574
At that point, all I could
hear was the baby crying.

986
01:15:05,338 --> 01:15:06,239
- What?

987
01:15:06,341 --> 01:15:07,643
The baby survived?

988
01:15:09,342 --> 01:15:10,173
- He did.

989
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:12,109
A little boy.

990
01:15:13,316 --> 01:15:14,683
- What happened to him?

991
01:15:17,352 --> 01:15:18,313
- Nobody told me.

992
01:15:20,388 --> 01:15:21,657
I went into shock.

993
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:29,566
And I've never stepped foot
in that building again.

994
01:15:30,496 --> 01:15:33,262
(solemn music)

995
01:15:55,223 --> 01:15:56,054
- Hey.

996
01:16:01,263 --> 01:16:02,324
- Hey Kimmy.

997
01:16:04,334 --> 01:16:05,635
- Where are you going?

998
01:16:06,597 --> 01:16:07,637
- Out.

999
01:16:08,837 --> 01:16:09,798
- Can you stay for a
few minutes, please?

1000
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,201
I need to talk to you.

1001
01:16:12,342 --> 01:16:13,335
- I've got plans, kid.

1002
01:16:14,473 --> 01:16:15,304
- Izzy...

1003
01:16:18,414 --> 01:16:19,847
- Wanna talk about thi?

1004
01:16:28,459 --> 01:16:31,023
This whole fucking
thing is about me.

1005
01:16:34,999 --> 01:16:36,061
My life.

1006
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:39,767
- Izzy, I'm sorry, oka?

1007
01:16:39,869 --> 01:16:42,270
I didn't say your name
and I kept it anonymou.

1008
01:16:42,372 --> 01:16:43,599
I was just trying to help.

1009
01:16:43,701 --> 01:16:45,204
- Help who?

1010
01:16:45,306 --> 01:16:46,041
Yourself.

1011
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:47,105
- No, no...

1012
01:16:48,212 --> 01:16:49,345
I was trying to-

1013
01:16:49,447 --> 01:16:51,241
- You didn't have
to say my name.

1014
01:16:52,814 --> 01:16:54,915
It's obvious who
you're talking about.

1015
01:16:58,516 --> 01:17:02,989
You took my tragedy, ripped it
open, and put it on the page.

1016
01:17:04,426 --> 01:17:05,858
Congratulations.

1017
01:17:05,961 --> 01:17:07,327
You made me your guinea
pig just so you can

1018
01:17:07,429 --> 01:17:08,862
get a fuckin' A?

1019
01:17:08,964 --> 01:17:12,631
- No, please, Izzy, don't,
it wasn't like that, okay?

1020
01:17:12,733 --> 01:17:13,929
I need you to listen to me now

1021
01:17:14,031 --> 01:17:15,170
because it's really important.

1022
01:17:15,272 --> 01:17:17,102
- Like I needed you.

1023
01:17:21,674 --> 01:17:23,740
I buried my mom.

1024
01:17:23,842 --> 01:17:25,407
Where the fuck were yo?

1025
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,316
(solemn music)

1026
01:17:29,418 --> 01:17:30,384
- Izzy, I'm sorry.

1027
01:17:30,486 --> 01:17:32,650
- No.
- No, I am sorry!

1028
01:17:32,752 --> 01:17:35,021
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

1029
01:17:37,287 --> 01:17:38,956
If you were there,
you wouldn't have had

1030
01:17:39,058 --> 01:17:41,395
to write this fucking
paper just to make

1031
01:17:41,497 --> 01:17:43,260
yourself feel better.

1032
01:17:45,261 --> 01:17:46,764
I mean, did you
even ask yourself

1033
01:17:46,866 --> 01:17:49,200
why I was so fucked up after?

1034
01:17:50,937 --> 01:17:53,108
Bro, you were the
only family left.

1035
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:54,436
And you left.

1036
01:17:55,807 --> 01:17:57,842
- Izzy, I'm sorry.

1037
01:17:57,944 --> 01:18:00,043
I am, I'm sorry,
Izzy, please stay.

1038
01:18:00,145 --> 01:18:02,719
- I just wanted you
to fight for me.

1039
01:18:03,815 --> 01:18:05,615
- Izzy, please.

1040
01:18:05,717 --> 01:18:08,420
(Kim crying)

1041
01:18:08,522 --> 01:18:10,686
(door opens)

1042
01:18:10,788 --> 01:18:13,356
(door slams)

1043
01:18:27,775 --> 01:18:30,178
- Druids worshiped Pagan gods.

1044
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,782
(tense music)

1045
01:18:37,918 --> 01:18:41,516
"Goddess of revenge, war, .

1046
01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:44,156
Known as 'fury.'"

1047
01:18:48,565 --> 01:18:50,393
Often takes the form of a crow.

1048
01:18:53,567 --> 01:18:56,267
(tense music)

1049
01:19:08,419 --> 01:19:10,248
The mark of the Morrig.

1050
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:22,832
(Kim panting)

1051
01:19:36,611 --> 01:19:37,711
(suspenseful music)

1052
01:19:37,813 --> 01:19:42,852
(Kim grunting)
(banging on wall)

1053
01:19:50,856 --> 01:19:53,362
(dramatic music)

1054
01:19:53,464 --> 01:19:56,492
(Kim hyperventilating)

1055
01:19:59,601 --> 01:20:01,500
(dramatic music)

1056
01:20:01,602 --> 01:20:03,533
(door closes)

1057
01:20:03,635 --> 01:20:04,906
Kim.

1058
01:20:05,008 --> 01:20:06,236
Okay, just the facts,
and the facts are weir.

1059
01:20:06,339 --> 01:20:07,639
I found something on
the stained glass windw

1060
01:20:07,741 --> 01:20:08,607
in your apartment.

1061
01:20:08,709 --> 01:20:09,575
I was researching...

1062
01:20:09,677 --> 01:20:11,012
Anyway, whatever.

1063
01:20:11,114 --> 01:20:12,913
I just need to tell you
about it as soon as possible.

1064
01:20:13,016 --> 01:20:14,547
And maybe you shouldn't
be there right now.

1065
01:20:14,649 --> 01:20:15,513
If you are there.

1066
01:20:15,615 --> 01:20:16,718
Okay.

1067
01:20:16,820 --> 01:20:17,946
Call me back as soon
as you get this.

1068
01:20:18,048 --> 01:20:18,782
I'm coming over.

1069
01:20:18,884 --> 01:20:21,517
(ominous music)

1070
01:20:31,401 --> 01:20:34,062
(door closes)

1071
01:20:34,164 --> 01:20:37,907
(Kim breathing heavily)

1072
01:20:39,069 --> 01:20:42,043
(Kim whimpering)

1073
01:20:57,995 --> 01:21:02,162
- That was the last picture
taken of my parents.

1074
01:21:09,738 --> 01:21:11,006
Do you recognize anything?

1075
01:21:15,379 --> 01:21:17,606
(Kim crying)

1076
01:21:19,847 --> 01:21:21,445
My mother's necklace.

1077
01:21:24,755 --> 01:21:27,385
Morrigu chooses
who wears it next.

1078
01:21:32,661 --> 01:21:33,996
She's with her now.

1079
01:21:37,029 --> 01:21:38,894
And she needs to feed.

1080
01:21:38,996 --> 01:21:42,305
(Kim crying)

1081
01:21:42,407 --> 01:21:43,698
feed her children.

1082
01:21:49,406 --> 01:21:52,443
If I don't satisfy
the crows soon,

1083
01:21:54,146 --> 01:21:56,678
she's going to come after me.

1084
01:21:59,054 --> 01:22:02,189
Like she did my
mother and my father.

1085
01:22:10,427 --> 01:22:14,399
Normally, it would
be done by now.

1086
01:22:18,676 --> 01:22:21,043
But your friend is fighting it.

1087
01:22:22,778 --> 01:22:24,211
The others were quicke.

1088
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:29,986
I'm telling you this...

1089
01:22:34,289 --> 01:22:36,986
Because you're about to
join them in the walls.

1090
01:22:37,088 --> 01:22:40,791
(suspenseful music)

1091
01:22:40,893 --> 01:22:42,761
(Kim grunting)

1092
01:22:42,863 --> 01:22:46,002
(elevator beeping)

1093
01:22:47,705 --> 01:22:52,008
(muffled shouting and banging)

1094
01:23:00,012 --> 01:23:03,151
(knocking on door)

1095
01:23:07,985 --> 01:23:08,783
- Hello?

1096
01:23:10,824 --> 01:23:13,227
(door closes)

1097
01:23:14,859 --> 01:23:15,691
Kim?

1098
01:23:17,699 --> 01:23:19,433
(tense music)

1099
01:23:19,535 --> 01:23:20,269
Shit!

1100
01:23:20,371 --> 01:23:21,202
Oh, shit.

1101
01:23:22,573 --> 01:23:25,404
(window creaking)

1102
01:23:33,782 --> 01:23:36,811
(heavy breathing)

1103
01:23:39,449 --> 01:23:43,591
(bird caws)
(tense music)

1104
01:23:43,693 --> 01:23:46,791
(suspenseful music)

1105
01:23:46,893 --> 01:23:48,328
Izzy, Jesus.

1106
01:23:52,195 --> 01:23:53,465
- Ian, right?

1107
01:23:55,637 --> 01:23:56,468
- Yeah.

1108
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:58,035
Is Kim here?

1109
01:23:58,137 --> 01:23:59,405
Do you know where she is?

1110
01:24:00,171 --> 01:24:01,242
- She'll be back.

1111
01:24:02,746 --> 01:24:04,839
For now you can sit here...

1112
01:24:07,077 --> 01:24:08,117
And wait.

1113
01:24:09,618 --> 01:24:10,946
- Kim's...

1114
01:24:11,048 --> 01:24:11,751
- Shh.

1115
01:24:11,853 --> 01:24:14,651
(ominous music)

1116
01:24:16,792 --> 01:24:19,788
(muffled screaming)

1117
01:24:30,741 --> 01:24:31,837
- I don't have a choic!

1118
01:24:31,939 --> 01:24:33,306
(muffled screaming)

1119
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:36,612
Morrigu has been trapped
in the glass for centuries.

1120
01:24:36,714 --> 01:24:38,543
She's a part of my family.

1121
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:47,453
I found my father's journal.

1122
01:24:54,062 --> 01:24:56,830
He taught me about the curse.

1123
01:24:56,932 --> 01:24:59,462
He taught me how she feeds.

1124
01:24:59,564 --> 01:25:02,567
How the souls she
takes leave a totem

1125
01:25:03,469 --> 01:25:06,505
and allow her to
cross into our realm.

1126
01:25:08,474 --> 01:25:11,375
My parents thought
they could ignore it,

1127
01:25:11,477 --> 01:25:13,875
and she found a
way to get to them.

1128
01:25:16,115 --> 01:25:17,648
She won't get to me.

1129
01:25:18,787 --> 01:25:21,190
(Kim crying)

1130
01:25:25,125 --> 01:25:29,198
(speaking foreign language)

1131
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:34,868
(suspenseful music)
(bird cawing)

1132
01:25:34,970 --> 01:25:38,636
(speaking foreign language)

1133
01:25:40,711 --> 01:25:42,776
Take this offering.

1134
01:25:42,878 --> 01:25:45,742
(ominous music)

1135
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:48,316
Feed on her soul.

1136
01:25:55,252 --> 01:25:57,692
(Ronan grunts)

1137
01:25:57,794 --> 01:25:59,793
(both grunting)

1138
01:25:59,895 --> 01:26:02,858
(Ronan shouting)

1139
01:26:06,968 --> 01:26:08,230
You little bitch!

1140
01:26:08,332 --> 01:26:09,604
(suspenseful music)

1141
01:26:09,706 --> 01:26:11,966
(door closes)

1142
01:26:13,303 --> 01:26:15,937
(Kim crying)

1143
01:26:16,943 --> 01:26:17,712
- Izzy?

1144
01:26:17,814 --> 01:26:18,947
Izzy, where are you?

1145
01:26:19,049 --> 01:26:21,778
We need to leave,
we need to go now!

1146
01:26:22,984 --> 01:26:25,980
(knives clattering)

1147
01:26:33,290 --> 01:26:36,265
(solemn music)

1148
01:26:56,214 --> 01:26:57,819
(Kim crying)

1149
01:26:57,921 --> 01:26:59,849
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1150
01:27:02,121 --> 01:27:04,755
(Kim crying)

1151
01:27:07,158 --> 01:27:07,989
I'm sorry.

1152
01:27:35,023 --> 01:27:37,689
(ominous music)

1153
01:27:42,932 --> 01:27:45,598
(Ronan panting)

1154
01:28:02,115 --> 01:28:04,815
(tense music)

1155
01:28:07,417 --> 01:28:10,326
(door closes)

1156
01:28:15,096 --> 01:28:18,092
(suspenseful music)

1157
01:28:39,822 --> 01:28:40,653
- Kim.

1158
01:28:45,124 --> 01:28:46,728
Kimmy?

1159
01:28:46,830 --> 01:28:49,123
(tense music)

1160
01:28:54,070 --> 01:28:56,372
You can't save her now.

1161
01:29:06,245 --> 01:29:08,945
(tense music)

1162
01:29:21,591 --> 01:29:22,523
(ominous music)

1163
01:29:22,625 --> 01:29:25,566
(tinkling music)

1164
01:29:56,233 --> 01:29:57,194
(Kim gasps)
(suspenseful music)

1165
01:29:57,296 --> 01:30:00,062
(Ronan grunts)

1166
01:30:11,343 --> 01:30:14,182
(both grunt)

1167
01:30:14,284 --> 01:30:17,182
(Ronan panting)
(tense music)

1168
01:30:17,284 --> 01:30:20,214
(Ronan growling)

1169
01:30:30,267 --> 01:30:33,966
(person choking)
(Kim gasps)

1170
01:30:34,068 --> 01:30:34,899
- Izzy?

1171
01:30:37,172 --> 01:30:39,937
(person choking)

1172
01:30:42,505 --> 01:30:43,545
It's me.

1173
01:30:48,984 --> 01:30:50,246
Please.

1174
01:30:50,348 --> 01:30:51,179
It's Kim.

1175
01:30:54,621 --> 01:30:59,792
(ominous music)
(person choking)

1176
01:31:03,329 --> 01:31:05,699

1178
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:14,037
(suspenseful music)

1179
01:31:19,916 --> 01:31:20,576
Please.

1180
01:31:20,678 --> 01:31:21,984
Just let me save her, okay?

1181
01:31:22,086 --> 01:31:23,519
Just let me save Izzy.

1182
01:31:30,324 --> 01:31:31,219
I'll go with you.

1183
01:31:34,591 --> 01:31:36,899
(gun clicks)

1184
01:31:37,001 --> 01:31:37,524
Just please, okay?

1185
01:31:37,626 --> 01:31:38,666
I saw him.

1186
01:31:39,433 --> 01:31:41,735
I saw your father's face.

1187
01:31:44,438 --> 01:31:46,674
- That means she's her.

1188
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:50,271
It's time.

1189
01:31:53,246 --> 01:31:54,077
- Don't.

1190
01:31:55,811 --> 01:31:58,018
Don't do it, just...

1191
01:31:58,120 --> 01:31:58,917
Don't do it.

1192
01:32:00,157 --> 01:32:01,920
- It's my responsibility.

1193
01:32:05,028 --> 01:32:07,489
(Kim crying)

1194
01:32:07,591 --> 01:32:10,324
(Ronan grunts)

(Kim grunting)

1204
01:33:30,244 --> 01:33:31,075
Izzy?

(tinkling music)

1206
01:33:36,448 --> 01:33:37,279
Izzy?

1207
01:33:39,321 --> 01:33:42,251
(music box closes)

1208
01:33:49,628 --> 01:33:50,897
- Help me, Kim.

1209
01:33:52,597 --> 01:33:53,735
I need you.

1210
01:33:55,338 --> 01:33:56,430
- That's why I'm here.

1211
01:33:58,473 --> 01:33:59,939
I'm gonna help you, okay?

1212
01:34:03,142 --> 01:34:05,879
I just need you to take
off the necklace, okay?

1213
01:34:13,422 --> 01:34:14,822
Take the necklace off, Izzy.

1214
01:34:16,790 --> 01:34:21,994
(Izzy groaning)
(Kim gasps)

1215
01:34:22,530 --> 01:34:23,897
- Can you get me home?

1216
01:34:26,135 --> 01:34:26,966
Please.

1217
01:34:28,931 --> 01:34:30,101
- I love you, Izzy.

1218
01:34:31,274 --> 01:34:33,374
(Izzy laughing)

1219
01:34:33,476 --> 01:34:34,602
I won't let her have you, okay?

1220
01:34:34,704 --> 01:34:36,308
I won't.

1221
01:34:36,410 --> 01:34:39,110
(tense music)

1222
01:34:45,519 --> 01:34:48,487
(Izzy shouting)

1223
01:34:48,589 --> 01:34:50,957
- Help me, please help me.

1224
01:34:56,793 --> 01:34:58,967
(eerie music)

1225
01:34:59,069 --> 01:34:59,900
Help me.

1226
01:35:02,272 --> 01:35:04,938
(Izzy laughing)

1227
01:35:07,242 --> 01:35:08,073
Kimmy.

1228
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:11,109
I need you.

1229
01:35:17,684 --> 01:35:19,986
- Take the necklace of.

1230
01:35:20,983 --> 01:35:23,858
(Izzy laughing)

1231
01:35:31,730 --> 01:35:33,332

(Izzy shouting)

1237
01:35:55,555 --> 01:35:58,390
(Kim grunting)

1238
01:35:58,492 --> 01:36:00,855
(Kim shouting)

1239
01:36:00,957 --> 01:36:04,365
(Izzy laughing)

1240
01:36:04,467 --> 01:36:05,760
Izzy, I won't let you go.

1241
01:36:05,862 --> 01:36:07,165
- She's mine.

1242
01:36:07,899 --> 01:36:09,433
- Izzy, don't leave me.

1243
01:36:09,535 --> 01:36:10,564
Izzy.

1244
01:36:12,573 --> 01:36:14,406
(Kim whimpering)

1245
01:36:14,508 --> 01:36:16,937

(birds cawing)

1248
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:25,084
Don't leave.

1249
01:36:25,818 --> 01:36:27,882
I love you, Izzy, okay?

1250
01:36:27,984 --> 01:36:28,883
(knife clatters)

1251
01:36:28,985 --> 01:36:30,524
Please, I love you.

1252
01:36:30,626 --> 01:36:32,190
- Are you okay?
- Fuck.

1253
01:36:33,594 --> 01:36:35,428
It's okay, I'm okay.

1254
01:36:35,530 --> 01:36:37,828
I'm okay. (crying)

1255
01:36:37,931 --> 01:36:39,628
- Let's get the fuck outta.

1256
01:36:39,730 --> 01:36:41,069
- No.

1257
01:36:41,171 --> 01:36:42,002
Not yet.

1258
01:36:43,004 --> 01:36:45,907
Not until we destroy
that fucking window.

1259
01:36:46,903 --> 01:36:49,504
(solemn music)

1260
01:37:23,313 --> 01:37:25,606
(Izzy crying)

1261
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:03,985
(suspenseful music)

1262
01:38:07,985 --> 01:38:11,190
(banging on window)

1263
01:38:13,825 --> 01:38:16,591
(birds cawing)

1264
01:38:19,736 --> 01:38:22,132
Fuck, Kimmy, just
do it and leave!

1265
01:38:22,234 --> 01:38:25,636
Come on, Kimmy, just
do it and leave!

1266
01:38:25,738 --> 01:38:27,001
Kimmy, please.

1267
01:38:27,103 --> 01:38:30,077
(glass shatters)

1268
01:38:33,746 --> 01:38:36,545
(Kim whimpers)

1269
01:38:38,354 --> 01:38:39,682
It's okay.

1270
01:38:39,784 --> 01:38:40,717
Come on.

1271
01:38:40,819 --> 01:38:42,323
We gotta go.

1272
01:38:42,425 --> 01:38:44,619
(Kim crying)

1273
01:38:56,505 --> 01:38:58,801
(solemn music)

1274
01:38:58,903 --> 01:39:01,603
(door closes)

1275
01:39:15,586 --> 01:39:18,257
- [Kim] When you're one
of those left behind,

1276
01:39:19,491 --> 01:39:21,997
you understand that the
shadow will always exist.

1277
01:39:25,465 --> 01:39:28,630
There's no doomsday clock
ticking away your countdown.

1278
01:39:31,108 --> 01:39:34,207
It's more of an appreciation
for every single morning.

1279
01:39:36,277 --> 01:39:38,673
That's why I'm grateful
to be here with her.

1280
01:39:39,575 --> 01:39:42,347
She appreciates me
simply for existing.

1281
01:39:44,614 --> 01:39:47,517
She loves me because
I fight alongside her.

1282
01:39:49,190 --> 01:39:51,521
If the shadow wants
to knock on this door,

1283
01:39:54,026 --> 01:39:55,558
it'll have to take us both.

1284
01:39:58,502 --> 01:40:01,234
