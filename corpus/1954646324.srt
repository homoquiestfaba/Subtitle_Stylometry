1
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:25,919
<i>I wrote this story for Renee because</i>

2
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,969
<i>I wanted to believe in
the happily ever after.</i>

3
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,218
<i>Now, her story isn't unique,</i>

4
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,346
<i>but she is.</i>

5
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:42,018
<i>The way she speaks the truth.</i>

6
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,229
<i>The way she sees the world.</i>

7
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,907
<i>Once upon a time there was a girl
who loved fairy tales.</i>

8
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,578
<i>Her mind painted the brightest day.</i>

9
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,583
<i>And the darkest night.</i>

10
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,221
<i>But her imagination turned on her</i>

11
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:22,684
<i>and found her wherever she would hide.</i>

12
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,660
It's okay, it's okay now.

13
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,579
There, there, sweetheart.

14
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,915
Good night.

15
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:50,045
Now, where are we going to go
in our dreams tonight?

16
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,546
My garden.

17
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:55,717
Good, good.
Now you draw your beautiful garden.

18
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:33,380
<i>So she imagined the most beautiful garden.</i>

19
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:43,014
<i>But even the sun
could not outshine the gray.</i>

20
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,854
<i>When her best friend, Jessie, lost her mom,</i>

21
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:55,985
<i>she realized not every story has
a happy ending.</i>

22
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:02,617
<i>So the girl grew up
and left fairy tales behind,</i>

23
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:07,580
<i>but her music, art and friends
made her feel something...</i>

24
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:11,376
<i>...even if it wasn't happily ever after.</i>

25
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,172
- Yep?
- Hello?

26
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,800
You left this on the counter last night.

27
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,427
Crazy pills.

28
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,804
No, no, bipolar is not crazy.

29
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,140
What were you doing when the memory part
of my brain was forming?

30
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,433
- I forget.
- You what?

31
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,393
- Take them.
- Okay.

32
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,246
Only in Orlando.

33
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,719
Monday play list. Track four.

34
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,640
One, two, three...

35
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,888
- What?
- Sean sighting.

36
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,684
You ladies coming tonight?

37
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,228
I'm not a lady.

38
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,064
- Thanks.
- See you there.

39
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,901
He smells like leather.

40
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,903
He smells so good.

41
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,699
- No. It starts at midnight?
- So?

42
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,992
- We can be there for 10 minutes.
- It's Halloween.

43
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,953
- Are you kidding me?
- Who cares? My dad will kill me, Renee.

44
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,037
- You know that.
- He will not.

45
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,582
It says dancing on here.
Is it, you know, like sexy dancing?

46
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,502
Or, you know, girls getting
really close and...

47
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,546
We're going.

48
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,394
I don't want to get shanked
in strobe light hell,

49
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,521
so can we, you know,
please get out of here?

50
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,606
- Yeah, let's bounce.
- Let's explore a little bit.

51
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,150
- No.
- Let's explore.

52
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,527
There's nothing over there.

53
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,356
- Renee!
- Jessie!

54
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,607
We need to go home.

55
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,110
No. Where'd she go?

56
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,361
Where did... Are you drunk now?

57
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,697
- It was so beautiful.
- Hey, hey, come on.

58
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,116
You know what, this place sucks
and you're trashed and I wanna go home.

59
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,679
No, no, no. I like how this place is.

60
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,503
- No, well, I don't care, we're going home.
- You're not my mom, Jess!

61
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,001
- Walk your ass home then.
- Why don't you just...

62
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:24,879
Nice one. Way to go.

63
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,382
Don't leave like that.

64
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,883
Don't worry, I got you.

65
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,136
That was bad.

66
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,722
I'll take you home.

67
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,253
I think these swings are broken.

68
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,298
- Need me to push you?
- I think I do.

69
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,847
You're Superman!

70
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:06,267
Michael, come on. Dinner time.

71
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,944
- You wanna get higher?
- Shit, Mackey!

72
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,238
And, yes, I do have the shit.

73
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,407
Come on.

74
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,577
Got it? There you go.

75
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,875
Unbelievable.

76
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,004
Damn kids.

77
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,172
You know what I thought about
the first time I got high?

78
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,215
What?

79
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,384
That Adam and Eve must have been cavemen.

80
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,510
What?

81
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:44,556
Think about it, we grow up
and they tell us about Adam and Eve,

82
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:48,268
and then we go to school
and they teach us about cavemen.

83
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:51,730
The whole point of our education
is to get rid of those fairy tales.

84
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:55,233
I think Adam and Eve is
the truest story I've ever heard.

85
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:59,070
'Cause things are perfect
and then you ruin them.

86
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,449
Man's gonna cope.

87
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:06,119
Speaking of which,
word is it's snowing in Daytona.

88
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,538
- At Echo's?
- Yes.

89
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:09,873
Yes!

90
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,959
- Ready? One, two...
- Go!

91
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,552
Man, leave that poor fish alone.

92
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,888
Children's stories are sick, man.

93
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,932
You got Humpty Dumpty
chillin' on the wall, right?

94
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:30,018
I wouldn't be on the wall if I was an egg.

95
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:33,355
That's suicidal, man. You know, for real.

96
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,398
Maybe he was a crackhead.

97
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,775
He was just a dumb egg.

98
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,443
He's not an egg.

99
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,321
- Yeah, he was.
- No.

100
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:45,575
The nursery rhyme never says he's an egg.
The artist drew him like that.

101
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,702
Whatever, man.

102
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,413
The shit's set. Who's in?

103
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,378
This ain't free.

104
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:03,885
<i>If you wanna hang out</i>

105
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,222
<i>You gotta take her out</i>

106
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:13,019
<i>Cocaine</i>

107
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:19,150
<i>If you wanna get down</i>

108
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:23,363
<i>Down on the ground
Cocaine</i>

109
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:28,368
<i>If you got bad news</i>

110
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:34,040
<i>Gonna kick them blues
Cocaine</i>

111
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,754
<i>When your day is done</i>

112
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:42,841
<i>And you wanna run
Cocaine</i>

113
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:44,759
<i>Cocaine!</i>

114
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:47,137
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

115
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,390
<i>Don't forget this fact</i>

116
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:53,893
<i>You can't get it back
Cocaine</i>

117
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:56,104
<i>Cocaine!</i>

118
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:01,401
<i>She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie...</i>

119
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,278
Everybody!

120
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:06,156
<i>- Cocaine!
- Cocaine!</i>

121
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,992
- One more time, come on.
- One more time!

122
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,454
<i>She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie</i>

123
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,915
<i>Cocaine</i>

124
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,046
<i>Cocaine</i>

125
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,385
<i>Cocaine</i>

126
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:31,890
<i>Cocaine</i>

127
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,895
No!

128
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,148
No!

129
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:43,777
<i>Cocaine</i>

130
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:45,612
No.

131
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,449
<i>Cocaine</i>

132
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,453
No!

133
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,497
<i>Cocaine</i>

134
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:03,338
<i>She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie</i>

135
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:06,216
<i>Cocaine</i>

136
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,388
She don't lie, baby!

137
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:15,684
- Yeah!
- Love cocaine!

138
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,032
Hey, where you goin'?

139
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:37,867
Leave me alone.

140
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:40,495
I do believe you've got something of mine.

141
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:45,417
Come on, baby, get in the... Shit.

142
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,795
Cut her off.

143
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,678
Hey.

144
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,555
Hey, it's Renee.

145
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:45,310
<i>I'm sorry to call so late.</i>

146
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:50,565
<i>I kind of need you.</i>

147
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,578
- Hey!
- Hi.

148
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,455
Look at this ride.

149
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,750
No, it's not mine. It's my boss's.

150
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,473
- How you doin'? You look so good.
- Good.

151
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:12,128
You look... You look so different.

152
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:13,546
Can we go?

153
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,592
Hi, Jess.

154
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:20,053
Old friends, huh?

155
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:39,572
So, I'm working
for a big music manager now.

156
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:45,245
By working for him,
I mean I'm just interning,
you know, for free.

157
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,040
He still hasn't heard me sing yet.

158
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,042
So why were you in Daytona?

159
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:55,547
Thanks for getting me.

160
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:58,341
So where are we taking you,
your parents' house?

161
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:01,136
Or you wanna go to a crack house
or where do you wanna go?

162
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:03,054
I don't know yet.

163
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,056
It doesn't matter. Wherever it is,

164
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:07,225
I have to get the car
back to my manager first
and then wherever.

165
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:09,519
He's your boss.

166
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:22,198
You have got to be shitting me.

167
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:25,076
Relax. Okay? This is where my boss is.

168
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,080
It's just... It's kind of crazy that
there's a thing on addiction and stuff.

169
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:30,874
Wow. What a coincidence.

170
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:34,044
The way I see it, you kind of owe me one.
All right?

171
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:36,713
So just think about going in there

172
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:40,133
and listening to an ex-drug addict
who happens to be my manager.

173
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:41,301
He's your boss.

174
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:44,012
My boss slash future manager

175
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:46,181
is in there talking about
how he used to be a crack whore,

176
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,026
and I would say this is really good timing.

177
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:51,061
He was a crack whore.
You're calling me a crack whore then?

178
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,187
No, you're not a crack... It's the first...

179
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,439
It's the only drug slang thing I know.
I don't...

180
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,024
What else would I call you?

181
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:57,609
I mean, I'm not calling you that.

182
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,944
Just, whatever you do,
if you don't wanna go in there,

183
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,531
stay here, I'll be back in 10 minutes.

184
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,158
- Okay?
- Fine.

185
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:26,137
Excuse me.

186
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:30,308
Can I have a cigarette, please?
If you have an extra one?

187
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,353
Thank you.

188
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:43,113
Rough night?

189
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:46,074
- Rough life.
- Cheers.

190
00:22:57,585 --> 00:22:59,170
So are you addicted to Jesus?

191
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:03,133
Doing a favor for a friend. You?

192
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:04,968
Here for the communion wine.

193
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,137
I think it's probably watered down.

194
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:08,763
I'll see you in there?

195
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:11,391
- Nope.
- Okay.

196
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:15,895
Here you go. Not a scratch on it.

197
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:17,397
You rescue your princess?

198
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:23,111
Yeah. This is her, I mean, this is Renee.

199
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:26,740
Pleasure to meet you, I'm McKenna.

200
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:28,783
Princess Renee.

201
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:32,162
So, you're Dylan's manager?

202
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:35,165
Manager? You a rock star now?

203
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:38,126
Well, if you'll excuse me, rock star.

204
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:40,879
That's the crack whore?

205
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,424
Don't call him... Between us, all right?

206
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:47,886
All right, are you gonna come in?

207
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:59,564
The very first line of
cocaine that I ever took,

208
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:02,442
the first bump, if you like,

209
00:24:02,734 --> 00:24:05,570
man, I was in love, okay?

210
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:08,281
It was the love of my life.

211
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:13,244
Any doubt, any insecurity that I had, gone.

212
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:16,247
It was bigger than my job,
bigger than my family,

213
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:18,291
my friends, you know, bigger than me,

214
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,085
and I was a god, remember?

215
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:24,214
I think rock bottom for me

216
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:28,551
was a three-day cocaine binge.

217
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:32,222
I was a mess. I was, you know, bloody nose

218
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:35,016
and I wasn't sleeping obviously

219
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:36,935
and I'd run out, I couldn't get anymore.

220
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:40,271
So I was scrabbling around on the floor

221
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:44,234
looking for crumbs in the carpet.

222
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:50,323
And I drank a bottle of vodka
and my heart stopped and I flatlined.

223
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:55,537
I actually ended up withdrawing on my own
at my parents' house,

224
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:57,414
I was

225
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,582
lying on my... My parent's couch

226
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:03,211
and my father just sitting there

227
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:05,505
holding my hand and...

228
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:08,383
He had his other hand on my head

229
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:12,387
the way that...

230
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:17,600
I don't have any conclusions for you guys.

231
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:19,769
I'm very much a work in progress myself.

232
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:22,397
But if you take anything from today,

233
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:25,275
let it be that addiction is real.
It's bigger than you are.

234
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:41,291
Shit, shit!

235
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:40,475
I know a place.

236
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:44,354
- You want me to make a...
- Yes, yes.

237
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:50,110
You know, down there
there's a trampoline, somewhere.

238
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:55,240
Renee Yohe?

239
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:12,048
So I'll take it. When can I move in?

240
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:17,595
So do you have drugs in your system?

241
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,557
Yeah. Don't most people who come here?

242
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:26,521
So what drugs have you taken
in the last 72 hours?

243
00:27:26,771 --> 00:27:29,357
Some uppers, mostly just coke.

244
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:30,859
That it?

245
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,070
Alcohol.

246
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:38,241
Ecstasy, but not that much.

247
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:43,830
What about legal drugs, prescriptions?
You know, for conditions.

248
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:49,878
I'm here because I have a drug problem.
Not prescription drug problem.

249
00:27:49,961 --> 00:27:53,381
You ever been diagnosed
with any mood disorders?

250
00:27:58,011 --> 00:27:59,262
Miss Yohe?

251
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:04,267
I don't see how that has
anything to do with anything. Sorry.

252
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:08,938
How long have you
been off your medication?

253
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:10,398
Are you gonna let me in or no?

254
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:12,067
Is my audition finished?

255
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:14,527
You need a dance
or a little song or something?

256
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:17,822
No, but I do need to see your arm.

257
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:20,825
Congratulations, guys.

258
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:24,996
You brought me to the only rehab
that doesn't take drug addicts.

259
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,081
I didn't make the cut, let's go.

260
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:28,083
- This isn't a detox center, you know that.
- Yeah, but...

261
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:29,542
You need to bring her
back when she's clean.

262
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:31,961
- Are you kidding me?
- Like... Is that a joke?

263
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:33,525
- Guys...
- Guys, just give me a second.

264
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:35,882
Conrad, let her detox here.
What's the problem?

265
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:38,760
We're not equipped, we're not insured
to deal with detoxing.

266
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:41,221
You can't take drug addicts?
Then who gets rehabbed here?

267
00:28:41,262 --> 00:28:42,722
Bring her back in five days.

268
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:45,183
She can't sit in a room
without drugs for five days.

269
00:28:45,225 --> 00:28:46,559
That's why we came here.
That's why she's here.

270
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:48,353
Okay, everybody just needs to calm down.

271
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:50,814
No, you don't understand how hard it was
to get her here.

272
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:55,068
Stop! Stop! This is why I can't.

273
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:02,701
Let's just go, please.

274
00:29:12,711 --> 00:29:15,380
My God. Who does that?

275
00:29:15,505 --> 00:29:16,665
So how do you know this girl?

276
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:19,884
We just met.

277
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:23,722
Come on, let her in.

278
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:28,018
Look, you saw her arm.
She could trigger the other girls. I can't...

279
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:30,437
I can't risk a fresh cut.
You know the deal, David.

280
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,272
Just bring her back.

281
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:33,732
Hey.

282
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,736
Where you been,
why haven't I seen you at meetings lately?

283
00:29:38,361 --> 00:29:40,238
You know, business.

284
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:42,449
Yeah. I know bullshit.

285
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:45,660
This might be a very good thing
to happen for you, you know.

286
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:50,540
- Nothing is happening to me.
- Five days, no drugs, no new cuts.

287
00:29:50,665 --> 00:29:52,042
I can't commit to that!

288
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:53,877
Well, I remember somebody
committing to that for you.

289
00:29:54,085 --> 00:29:56,671
- You're an asshole.
- Bring her back.

290
00:29:57,047 --> 00:29:58,923
I can't do that.

291
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:06,848
Wow, I haven't seen your parents
in, like, forever.

292
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:08,350
Yeah, me neither.

293
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:19,944
- Renee!
- Hey, baby!

294
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:23,073
Oh, my God, I haven't seen you in forever.

295
00:30:23,114 --> 00:30:24,157
Think you can stay?

296
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,535
April, honey, go inside, please.

297
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:28,661
Can Renee come in?

298
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:31,289
Honey, inside, please.

299
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,170
- Hey, Dad.
- Hello, Renee.

300
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:38,838
I...

301
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:42,008
I'm gonna go to rehab in a few days.

302
00:30:42,592 --> 00:30:45,136
Good, good, that's really good.

303
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:47,472
And I just need to...

304
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:53,728
Actually, I was wondering if I could
stay here for, like, just until I go.

305
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:55,605
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

306
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:57,107
Crap.

307
00:30:57,899 --> 00:30:59,067
He's not gonna let her stay.

308
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:01,236
Can she stay at your place?

309
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:04,948
No. My dad's not into sleepovers.
Not since my mom died.

310
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:06,408
She can stay with me.

311
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:08,118
Yeah, that's a great idea, Dylan.

312
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:09,619
What's wrong with his?

313
00:31:09,703 --> 00:31:12,455
I don't know.
Just his mother being a raging alcoholic

314
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,791
might get in the way. No big deal.

315
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:17,085
Dad, I literally don't have anywhere else
I can go.

316
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:20,797
I'm sorry. I promised myself
it wasn't going to happen again, okay?

317
00:31:21,715 --> 00:31:23,842
And the last time you stayed here,

318
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:26,553
- it was your... Please just listen to me.
- I know... No, don't...

319
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:28,388
It was your sister who found your blood.

320
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:31,725
Okay, I am aware of that.
It's not going to happen ever again.

321
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:34,227
You don't understand, Dad.
If you don't let me stay here...

322
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:35,729
- No, I do understand.
- ...I have nowhere else to go.

323
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:38,440
Five minutes.
Thank you, thank you very much.

324
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:39,566
- David?
- Yes?

325
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:41,609
- Can she stay with you?
- No, she can't.

326
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:43,153
I can't let it happen to your sister
and I can't...

327
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:45,905
Dad, you can't!
You have to let me stay here.

328
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:48,408
- Please.
- No. She's your friend, mate.

329
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,743
But you just stood up in church and said

330
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:51,453
how important it is for people
to have strong support.

331
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:54,039
I know what I just did and I am having
a tough time at the moment, Dylan.

332
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,749
- I've got a lot on my...
- Please. I know. So is she!

333
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:57,542
- You love me so much?
- I would do anything for you, but...

334
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:59,627
You don't want me to sleep in my room
so I can get better?

335
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:01,171
- Dylan, please.
- ...go home to something like this.

336
00:32:01,212 --> 00:32:02,839
- Can I just have five seconds to try...
- She trusts you.

337
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:05,550
- And you have a huge house.
- You have a huge house?

338
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:07,886
- Well, it's big!
- Fine!

339
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:11,639
You shut up, and you stop sulking,

340
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:14,184
and you're all staying at my place.

341
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:15,477
...one of the things I can't do...

342
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,644
You would not do anything

343
00:32:16,728 --> 00:32:18,480
because you're not letting me sleep
where I need to sleep!

344
00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:19,606
Mr. Yohe, my name's David McKenna.

345
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:22,400
Do you mind if Renee stays with me
for a couple of days?

346
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,759
She's gonna need to get some things.

347
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:56,393
Lovely.

348
00:33:04,275 --> 00:33:06,736
You moving out or you moving in?

349
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:07,946
Not sure yet.

350
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:09,072
This is fancy.

351
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:12,367
- Hey, Renee.
- Yep.

352
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:17,414
In this house
there's no booze and no drugs. Okay?

353
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:20,542
Just sleep, coffee and cigarettes.

354
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:23,063
My number one rule, we don't get tired
and we don't get hungry.

355
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:26,047
Okay.

356
00:33:26,131 --> 00:33:27,966
- You in?
- I'm in.

357
00:33:28,216 --> 00:33:29,718
Let's do it.

358
00:33:31,261 --> 00:33:35,223
Okay, kitchen, my quarters, hot tub,
you lot can park it upstairs,

359
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:37,600
middle room's my office, no kids allowed.
We clear?

360
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:40,437
And you got first dibs. You two...

361
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:50,363
Addiction is a very
complicated relationship.

362
00:33:50,572 --> 00:33:52,574
We've been friends with Renee
for, like, 12 years.

363
00:33:52,657 --> 00:33:54,659
- Trust me, we know.
- Okay, all right.

364
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:56,077
This is not Renee.

365
00:33:57,245 --> 00:34:00,582
<i>You have to think invasion of
the Body Snatchersor something, okay?</i>

366
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:04,669
Every single thing in her,
every fiber of her being

367
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:07,005
wants one thing,
is thinking about one thing,

368
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:09,924
cares about one thing and it's not you,
and it's not me.

369
00:34:10,258 --> 00:34:12,052
It's drugs, okay?

370
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:13,845
So what do we do?

371
00:34:13,887 --> 00:34:15,138
What we do is...

372
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:19,267
Okay, the game plan is distractions,
distractions, distractions. Okay?

373
00:34:19,351 --> 00:34:21,895
Dylan, you're on snack duty, okay?

374
00:34:21,936 --> 00:34:24,856
Take Renee, don't let her out of
your sight. Come straight back.

375
00:34:24,939 --> 00:34:27,525
She'll ask you to go someplace else,
you don't go, you don't deviate,

376
00:34:27,567 --> 00:34:29,944
you come back here.
Half an hour, 30 minutes. All right?

377
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:32,280
Or I'm coming after you. Jessie?

378
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:35,951
Jessie, take all the knives and anything
sharp in the house and hide them.

379
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:37,956
You want me to
hide all the knives in the house?

380
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:39,746
Did you see her arm?

381
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:44,042
Look, all the ways you want to punish Renee
for being a shit friend

382
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:46,252
will pale in comparison to the ways
Renee will punish herself.

383
00:34:46,336 --> 00:34:48,254
Now get on with it.

384
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:50,882
All right, let's go.

385
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:54,052
Dylan? Don't forget my Lucky Charms.

386
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:02,727
Animal crackers! Oh, yes!

387
00:35:05,522 --> 00:35:07,065
I missed you.

388
00:35:07,524 --> 00:35:10,360
Yeah, I mean, why did we stop hanging out
in the first place?

389
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:13,655
What is this? What are we doing?
We're hanging out.

390
00:35:13,738 --> 00:35:15,365
We used to hang out,
like, every day together

391
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:17,867
and now you're a completely
different person

392
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:20,078
doing different things and I don't know...

393
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:22,288
Different things?

394
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:24,444
You know what I'm talking about.

395
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:26,381
- I know what you're talking about.
- You know.

396
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,962
Why did you do that to your arm?

397
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:33,425
It just looked right.

398
00:35:33,508 --> 00:35:37,429
Well, I like the way you look without it.
'Cause it's not true.

399
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:39,282
Crap, sorry. I didn't know this was...

400
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:42,308
No, no, no. I got this. I got this.

401
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:44,060
Okay.

402
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:39,926
Whoa, McKenna, whoa!

403
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,553
Jamie!

404
00:37:42,554 --> 00:37:44,556
You nearly gave me a heart attack,
you wanker.

405
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:46,119
When did we start sounding the alarm?

406
00:37:46,725 --> 00:37:47,726
Today.

407
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:49,047
And when did we get new friends?

408
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:50,270
Keeping her safe.

409
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:53,565
- Obvious enough.
- Renee,

410
00:37:53,648 --> 00:37:57,152
meet Jamie, my sometimes housemate,
who I'm guessing missed his flight.

411
00:37:57,402 --> 00:37:58,570
Jessie. Good night.

412
00:37:58,945 --> 00:38:01,072
Dylan took your room,
so you can bunk with him.

413
00:38:01,573 --> 00:38:04,659
All right! Bunk buddies. See you up there.

414
00:38:04,743 --> 00:38:08,079
This is David McKenna.
Everything's fine, false alarm.

415
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:14,669
Want some Lucky Charms?

416
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:24,054
I know this isn't any of my business,
but you all right, Renee?

417
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:26,514
I'm a coozer.

418
00:38:26,765 --> 00:38:30,185
- A coozer?
- It's coke and booze together.

419
00:38:30,226 --> 00:38:32,604
I made it up, do you like it?

420
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:37,901
Yeah. I don't think McKenna coozes much.

421
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:39,903
He's such a quitter.

422
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:43,573
So what's you're... Who do you...
What's your deal?

423
00:38:45,116 --> 00:38:47,619
I'm actually a lot more
interested in you right now.

424
00:38:47,702 --> 00:38:48,745
I'll bet.

425
00:38:51,748 --> 00:38:55,418
I need a place to detox for a few days
till I go to rehab

426
00:38:55,502 --> 00:38:59,589
and McKenna is donating to my charity.

427
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:02,467
Nosy.

428
00:39:02,717 --> 00:39:05,095
I didn't mean to be nosy.

429
00:39:05,553 --> 00:39:07,639
I'm just really...

430
00:39:08,848 --> 00:39:10,141
That's really brave.

431
00:39:10,725 --> 00:39:12,394
I'm happy for you.

432
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:16,731
Why doesn't he have knives?

433
00:39:20,568 --> 00:39:21,569
So what do you do?

434
00:39:22,904 --> 00:39:26,908
I am a rep for a surf company.

435
00:39:27,283 --> 00:39:31,246
McKenna's nice enough to let me crash here
when I'm in town.

436
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:33,581
- You're like a traveling salesman?
- Yeah.

437
00:39:34,082 --> 00:39:35,709
Legit job.

438
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:38,586
Office. Grown-up stuff.

439
00:39:39,212 --> 00:39:42,007
But what I really wanna do is write.

440
00:39:44,843 --> 00:39:46,761
You like Paper Route?

441
00:39:46,845 --> 00:39:48,847
They're playing at
the Florida Music Fest tomorrow.

442
00:39:49,597 --> 00:39:51,878
Yeah. We should go.
You think the warden will let you out?

443
00:39:51,891 --> 00:39:54,060
I will dig my way out.

444
00:39:54,894 --> 00:39:56,479
Right on.

445
00:39:57,939 --> 00:39:59,983
So you out tomorrow morning or...

446
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:02,569
Actually the day after,
if that's okay with you.

447
00:40:02,652 --> 00:40:04,237
Yeah, the more the merrier.

448
00:40:04,404 --> 00:40:07,032
All right, thank you.

449
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:08,950
No problem.

450
00:40:10,452 --> 00:40:12,328
Appreciate it.

451
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:16,708
And congratulations on
your new life, Renee.

452
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:20,211
- Good night.
- Bye!

453
00:40:24,549 --> 00:40:26,760
Pretty good.

454
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:29,596
How are you feeling?

455
00:40:30,055 --> 00:40:31,848
Like my soul got kicked in the nuts.

456
00:40:33,266 --> 00:40:34,476
Good.

457
00:40:34,684 --> 00:40:39,064
Well, not good that you feel
like your soul's been kicked in the balls,

458
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:42,776
but it's good you're being honest.
Secrets make you sick.

459
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:45,070
I like that, McKenna.

460
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:47,364
- Remember it.
- Yes, sir.

461
00:40:51,076 --> 00:40:52,660
Thank you

462
00:40:53,745 --> 00:40:55,372
for all of this.

463
00:40:56,748 --> 00:40:58,868
Somebody did it for me,
you'll do it for someone else.

464
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:02,545
All right, thanks for the sandwich.

465
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:04,798
Sleep tight.

466
00:41:21,314 --> 00:41:22,774
This is slave labor.

467
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:24,943
I prefer the term internship.

468
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:26,778
It's all gonna be back next week.

469
00:41:27,153 --> 00:41:29,406
So will you. It's a test of wills, mate.

470
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:32,117
- Hey.
- There she is!

471
00:41:32,367 --> 00:41:34,369
You all right, sleeping beauty?

472
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:41,334
You have an extra one of those...
Thank you.

473
00:41:42,627 --> 00:41:44,129
Hey, boss?

474
00:41:44,295 --> 00:41:47,215
I have three...
No, I have four questions for you.

475
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:50,218
- I'll answer two. Maybe.
- Okay.

476
00:41:50,343 --> 00:41:52,095
One, why don't you have any furniture?

477
00:41:52,178 --> 00:41:53,722
Two, where'd you get your tattoo,

478
00:41:53,847 --> 00:41:58,601
three, how come you left England,
and four, I'll ask you later.

479
00:41:58,727 --> 00:42:00,395
One, I just haven't found
the right sofa yet,

480
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:03,606
I wish people would stop pressuring me,
and two, I got that bad boy in prison.

481
00:42:03,732 --> 00:42:05,275
Prison? What did you do?

482
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,736
Only answering two questions.

483
00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:11,072
- Hey! Right on.
- Hey, Jamie!

484
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:12,240
Looking great, guys.

485
00:42:12,532 --> 00:42:14,993
So what are you doing
your last night in Orlando?

486
00:42:15,076 --> 00:42:17,495
I was thinking Florida Music Fest.

487
00:42:18,538 --> 00:42:20,819
I mean, your band's playing, right?
We'll all go together.

488
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:24,210
You have bands? McKenna, I wanna go.

489
00:42:24,502 --> 00:42:27,222
One band, and, no, you can't go,
you're staying with the babysitters.

490
00:42:27,964 --> 00:42:29,424
I thought she needed distractions.

491
00:42:29,507 --> 00:42:32,510
Yeah, if there's music,
I'm not thinking about drugs.

492
00:42:32,635 --> 00:42:35,638
No, there's no drugs at a music festival.
It's a great idea.

493
00:42:36,014 --> 00:42:38,558
Exactly. I don't have extra tickets anyway,
so it's settled.

494
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:39,851
Turns out Hurley's sponsoring the event.

495
00:42:39,893 --> 00:42:43,521
Made a call, got us VIP treatment
and Paper Route's playing.

496
00:42:45,023 --> 00:42:47,734
And we'll be there
to support your band, Between the Trees.

497
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:48,943
Why thank you, Jamie.

498
00:42:49,277 --> 00:42:54,991
<i>What would you say if I told you
that I'm not giving up?</i>

499
00:42:55,075 --> 00:42:58,244
<i>However long it takes</i>

500
00:43:00,747 --> 00:43:03,500
<i>It's clear that things have changed</i>

501
00:43:03,541 --> 00:43:05,377
<i>Since when we started</i>

502
00:43:05,418 --> 00:43:08,922
<i>But we can't just walk away, babe</i>

503
00:43:09,005 --> 00:43:11,758
<i>So I am telling you that</i>

504
00:43:11,841 --> 00:43:18,223
<i>I know things aren't quite
like what they used to be</i>

505
00:43:20,392 --> 00:43:22,268
<i>Different faces,
different places</i>

506
00:43:22,394 --> 00:43:26,106
I needed this. Thank you.

507
00:43:28,233 --> 00:43:29,734
You're welcome.

508
00:43:32,362 --> 00:43:35,490
Boys, nice one, well done, more of
the same please. That was the bollocks.

509
00:43:35,824 --> 00:43:37,200
So when are we gonna meet Stevo?

510
00:43:37,242 --> 00:43:39,452
Just let me handle the business.

511
00:43:39,536 --> 00:43:41,413
You're going to meet him
right after the second set.

512
00:43:41,496 --> 00:43:43,331
Go make daddy proud.

513
00:43:45,917 --> 00:43:50,839
<i>Where have I landed
I don't quite remember</i>

514
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:56,052
<i>I fell to pieces
one night in December</i>

515
00:43:56,136 --> 00:43:59,556
<i>The memories of losing you</i>

516
00:43:59,597 --> 00:44:02,058
<i>You're like a ghost</i>

517
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:05,645
<i>Tracing where I said to you</i>

518
00:44:05,729 --> 00:44:08,314
<i>I wish you would listen</i>

519
00:44:08,398 --> 00:44:10,483
- Lift me up!
- Oh, no!

520
00:44:10,567 --> 00:44:14,404
Yes, Dylan, lift me up!
Lift me up! Come on!

521
00:44:14,529 --> 00:44:17,073
Please, you guys, if anyone
is doing drugs up there,

522
00:44:17,157 --> 00:44:18,742
I will come right down immediately.

523
00:44:19,075 --> 00:44:20,452
They might be.

524
00:44:20,577 --> 00:44:22,579
No, no, no. McKenna will kill me.

525
00:44:22,704 --> 00:44:24,824
- Please, please, Dylan.
- Just watch from right here.

526
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:26,833
Come on, one...

527
00:44:27,459 --> 00:44:28,960
Be right back?

528
00:44:29,044 --> 00:44:32,380
Girl scout's honor. One, two, three!

529
00:44:33,548 --> 00:44:38,511
<i>Looking for love like
a bride looks for dresses</i>

530
00:44:38,553 --> 00:44:41,931
<i>The memories of losing you</i>

531
00:44:42,015 --> 00:44:44,434
<i>You're like a ghost</i>

532
00:44:44,517 --> 00:44:47,812
<i>Tracing where I said to you</i>

533
00:44:47,896 --> 00:44:50,648
<i>I wish you would listen</i>

534
00:44:50,732 --> 00:44:53,276
<i>I wish you would listen</i>

535
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,862
<i>I wish you would listen</i>

536
00:44:55,904 --> 00:44:57,697
<i>To get through it</i>

537
00:44:58,323 --> 00:45:00,658
<i>I wish you would listen</i>

538
00:45:00,867 --> 00:45:01,993
McKenna?

539
00:45:02,077 --> 00:45:03,453
- Stevo.
- What's up?

540
00:45:03,536 --> 00:45:04,579
- How you doing?
- Good.

541
00:45:04,662 --> 00:45:05,872
- Safe trip?
- All good.

542
00:45:05,914 --> 00:45:09,376
Okay, good. Anyway, listen,
are you a Between the Trees fan yet?

543
00:45:10,251 --> 00:45:12,879
- We'll see.
- Okay.

544
00:45:12,921 --> 00:45:14,047
When can I meet the band?

545
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:17,842
I'll introduce you right after the second set.
Listen, would you excuse me a minute, yeah?

546
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:20,011
Hey, where's Renee?

547
00:45:20,053 --> 00:45:21,054
She's up there, we just put her up there.

548
00:45:21,513 --> 00:45:25,934
Tell me you are joking.
You put her up there?
We're at a music festival!

549
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:28,144
It's fine, McKenna!

550
00:45:28,645 --> 00:45:30,063
Well, she's not there now!

551
00:45:30,146 --> 00:45:32,148
I told you this was a bad idea!

552
00:45:32,232 --> 00:45:35,068
Okay, Jessie, you go that way,
you get back in the crowd

553
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:37,487
and you come with me!

554
00:45:47,455 --> 00:45:50,041
- Yohe! Yohe!
- Hey!

555
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:53,461
Where you been?
What happened to you back in Daytona?

556
00:45:53,545 --> 00:45:55,213
What, you get saved or kidnapped
or something?

557
00:45:55,296 --> 00:45:58,299
A little bit of both.
I lost my group I came with.

558
00:45:58,758 --> 00:46:02,762
Why don't you get in,
I'll take you around the
front by the stage.

559
00:46:08,768 --> 00:46:12,647
Hey, wanna go downtown?
I got some mad snow not far from here.

560
00:46:12,731 --> 00:46:15,191
No, no more snow. I'm done with that.

561
00:46:15,275 --> 00:46:18,361
Two days sober, man, three days to rehab.

562
00:46:18,445 --> 00:46:19,863
How Hollywood of you.

563
00:46:19,904 --> 00:46:22,064
Come on, you sure you don't want to go out
with a bang?

564
00:46:22,073 --> 00:46:23,700
No. Take me back.

565
00:46:24,034 --> 00:46:25,368
All right.

566
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:31,875
- Renee!
- Hey, hey, hold on.

567
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:36,087
Hey, all right. Thanks.

568
00:46:36,212 --> 00:46:37,881
Sure thing. Stay safe.

569
00:46:38,006 --> 00:46:40,300
Yeah, you too. Hey.

570
00:46:41,343 --> 00:46:43,386
Is that one of your boyfriends?

571
00:46:43,553 --> 00:46:45,805
What's your problem? No, no.
What's your problem?

572
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:48,183
Did you just go use with that guy?

573
00:46:48,224 --> 00:46:50,477
- Did I just use with that guy?
- Did you just go use with that guy?

574
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,896
No, I didn't go use with that guy, Jess!

575
00:46:52,937 --> 00:46:55,607
Just go home, dude, if you don't want
to be here, you don't have to be here.

576
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:56,775
I'm sure you'd love that, wouldn't you,

577
00:46:56,858 --> 00:46:58,651
so you could have a house full of men
all to yourself, right?

578
00:46:58,735 --> 00:47:01,196
What are you talking about?

579
00:47:01,363 --> 00:47:03,281
We used to be a family.

580
00:47:03,365 --> 00:47:05,909
- Do you know how much that means to me?
- Yes.

581
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:10,372
You gave up everything for some prick
at a bullshit rave.

582
00:47:10,413 --> 00:47:13,875
Whoa, you don't know
what happened with Sean. Okay?

583
00:47:13,917 --> 00:47:16,044
I don't care what happened, Renee,
'cause it's not about Sean,

584
00:47:16,127 --> 00:47:19,547
it's about you giving up everything
for the slightest bit of attention.

585
00:47:19,673 --> 00:47:20,840
Listen to me right now.

586
00:47:20,882 --> 00:47:23,843
I will tell you everything right now. He...

587
00:47:23,927 --> 00:47:25,261
Stop right there. Just stop right there.

588
00:47:25,345 --> 00:47:26,805
I don't care and I don't want to hear it.

589
00:47:26,888 --> 00:47:30,809
I'm so sick of
hearing your stories and your sadness

590
00:47:30,892 --> 00:47:33,978
and seeing your pity scars
all over your body.

591
00:47:34,062 --> 00:47:37,065
I'm so sick of it. I'm done.

592
00:47:37,148 --> 00:47:38,900
<i>I want to see what I dream</i>

593
00:47:38,983 --> 00:47:41,277
<i>I want the inconvenience</i>

594
00:47:41,361 --> 00:47:46,533
<i>I hope you see that
when you fall in love...</i>

595
00:48:10,724 --> 00:48:14,185
Stevo, no, no, Stevo's fine,
yeah, yeah, yeah,
he loved it.

596
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:16,563
Yeah, he really did, yeah.

597
00:48:16,646 --> 00:48:19,733
Yeah, something came up.

598
00:48:19,774 --> 00:48:23,570
Just let me deal with the
contracts, all right?

599
00:48:23,611 --> 00:48:27,949
No, no, no, no, I'll be there. Yeah.
No, I wouldn't miss it for the world.

600
00:48:28,658 --> 00:48:29,659
Yeah, okay.

601
00:48:46,801 --> 00:48:49,262
You going out for a smoke?

602
00:48:54,017 --> 00:48:56,061
Don't you have a plane to catch?

603
00:48:56,519 --> 00:49:00,148
It's delayed till we get you to rehab.

604
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:06,654
When I was a little kid I used to say that
planes were like these big friendly giants

605
00:49:07,405 --> 00:49:12,827
and if I had, like, a bad dream, bad idea,

606
00:49:13,078 --> 00:49:17,540
a plane would just fly them away.

607
00:49:18,124 --> 00:49:19,709
Sounds beautiful.

608
00:49:23,755 --> 00:49:25,965
Just wanna escape all this shit.

609
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:32,430
Yeah, you know, you remind me
of my friend, Zeke.

610
00:49:33,098 --> 00:49:34,224
Zeke.

611
00:49:34,307 --> 00:49:37,018
He'd say the worst part of his day
was the paddling back to shore.

612
00:49:37,435 --> 00:49:39,813
- Surfing?
- Yeah. He was a surf buddy.

613
00:49:43,191 --> 00:49:44,442
He died two months ago.

614
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:51,199
Took his own life. Now, I don't know
if I could have said something.

615
00:49:52,409 --> 00:49:56,371
But I wanna be the guy
who can say the right thing.

616
00:49:56,413 --> 00:49:58,039
You know?

617
00:50:01,042 --> 00:50:03,837
I think people might need more than words.

618
00:50:05,547 --> 00:50:06,631
Maybe.

619
00:50:11,886 --> 00:50:17,017
- You all right?
- Yeah, I think I... I think.

620
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:21,396
Is she okay? Is she all right?

621
00:50:23,189 --> 00:50:24,816
- No.
- Need some water?

622
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:27,193
- A blanket?
- She needs a bed.

623
00:50:28,403 --> 00:50:31,239
Here's a bucket, in case you need to...

624
00:50:31,322 --> 00:50:34,659
- I'm so cold.
- It's all right, I got it.

625
00:50:36,953 --> 00:50:41,207
My dad put this by my bed
every time I was ill.

626
00:50:41,249 --> 00:50:42,500
Let me get you some water.

627
00:50:45,837 --> 00:50:47,589
Is this normal?

628
00:50:48,089 --> 00:50:49,674
This is the worst part.

629
00:50:50,508 --> 00:50:52,135
Great.

630
00:50:52,218 --> 00:50:53,678
I'll be next door, okay?

631
00:50:54,971 --> 00:50:57,265
Yeah, hang in there.

632
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,460
I missed you.

633
00:51:29,422 --> 00:51:30,715
You wanna go for a ride?

634
00:51:31,841 --> 00:51:33,468
No.

635
00:51:51,277 --> 00:51:52,612
Am I ever going to be okay?

636
00:51:56,574 --> 00:51:59,411
Why did you make me like this?

637
00:52:14,801 --> 00:52:16,469
No, ma'am. What are you thinking...

638
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:21,474
<i>She's hurting herself.
She's cutting herself,</i>

639
00:52:21,558 --> 00:52:24,227
<i>and I don't understand.
What is wrong with her?</i>

640
00:52:25,228 --> 00:52:28,773
<i>Those pills are nothing. I don't want her...
I don't want her taking all those pills,</i>

641
00:52:28,857 --> 00:52:30,358
<i>do you understand?</i>

642
00:52:31,401 --> 00:52:32,881
<i>Why does she keep doing these things?</i>

643
00:52:32,902 --> 00:52:35,780
<i>It doesn't help to ask why.</i>

644
00:52:36,489 --> 00:52:40,618
<i>Why can't we help it? Why is she doing
these things? She's hurting herself.</i>

645
00:53:55,694 --> 00:53:57,362
What did I say?

646
00:53:57,404 --> 00:54:02,117
All business comes and goes through me.

647
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,245
No, that's... No, I...

648
00:54:05,328 --> 00:54:08,164
No, you... No, you...

649
00:54:08,248 --> 00:54:11,126
Will you let me speak? Please?

650
00:54:11,334 --> 00:54:13,878
You really wanna have this conversation?

651
00:54:14,004 --> 00:54:19,718
Three months ago you were performing
for a bunch of drunks in a bloody toilet.

652
00:54:20,635 --> 00:54:22,262
Don't you ever speak to me like that!

653
00:54:26,266 --> 00:54:27,392
Shit!

654
00:54:40,739 --> 00:54:41,906
Patio.

655
00:54:56,713 --> 00:54:58,340
It's nice, huh?

656
00:55:07,932 --> 00:55:10,810
- Bombay Bitches.
- What?

657
00:55:10,935 --> 00:55:13,897
Your third question.
The reason I left England.

658
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:17,567
For a band.
I got stuck here in Orlando for a few more.

659
00:55:17,692 --> 00:55:19,569
Bombay Bitches.

660
00:55:24,115 --> 00:55:27,160
Yeah, yeah, all right, I do know it,
you can stop, thank you.

661
00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:31,706
They were also the reason
I hit rock bottom fairly predictably.

662
00:55:31,873 --> 00:55:36,670
So is that how you did it?
You started over somewhere new and...

663
00:55:37,212 --> 00:55:40,465
No. That didn't work for me.

664
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:43,426
The problem was always me.

665
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:47,013
Wherever I went, there I was.

666
00:55:48,723 --> 00:55:51,226
A friend once said to me
that I should never be left unattended

667
00:55:51,309 --> 00:55:53,520
because what I get back to is me.

668
00:55:54,688 --> 00:55:56,690
And me is the problem.

669
00:55:57,982 --> 00:55:59,025
You need other people.

670
00:56:01,945 --> 00:56:04,114
What's today's date?

671
00:56:04,989 --> 00:56:06,616
The 15th.

672
00:56:06,825 --> 00:56:08,868
- I have to go somewhere. Please.
- Not a chance.

673
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:13,998
Please, please.
I'll take Dylan. It'll be fine.
Please. It's important.

674
00:56:14,541 --> 00:56:17,168
Take Dylan. One hour.
I'm trusting you, all right?

675
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:18,712
Thank you.

676
00:56:31,558 --> 00:56:34,310
Your dad said you were here.

677
00:56:36,938 --> 00:56:38,398
I'm really sorry we forgot.

678
00:56:43,737 --> 00:56:45,238
I miss you.

679
00:56:48,575 --> 00:56:49,975
It was like you died too, you know.

680
00:56:52,912 --> 00:56:54,205
I didn't.

681
00:56:54,748 --> 00:56:58,543
I miss her so much and
I can't lose you, too.

682
00:57:06,384 --> 00:57:08,887
Why did you stop calling us?

683
00:57:09,554 --> 00:57:11,554
It was just overnight,
you just stopped calling us.

684
00:57:15,643 --> 00:57:17,187
I just...

685
00:57:18,229 --> 00:57:22,734
Something happened
and I just didn't want to talk about it.

686
00:57:23,443 --> 00:57:28,907
I wanted to be alone and it just got...
It got out of hand.

687
00:57:29,032 --> 00:57:31,284
What are you talking about?

688
00:57:31,409 --> 00:57:33,119
Halloween party.

689
00:57:33,703 --> 00:57:39,209
Sean pulled over in a parking lot
so I could throw up.

690
00:57:51,971 --> 00:57:53,473
<i>And he raped me.</i>

691
00:58:00,689 --> 00:58:02,148
I mean, we had no idea.

692
00:58:02,732 --> 00:58:04,484
I'm so sorry.

693
00:58:04,693 --> 00:58:07,237
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

694
00:58:08,613 --> 00:58:13,159
I'm sorry about everything I said at
the concert. I'm sorry about everything.

695
00:58:13,368 --> 00:58:15,036
I'm sorry.

696
00:58:16,037 --> 00:58:17,789
Will you please come back to McKenna's?

697
00:58:17,872 --> 00:58:21,167
I'll come back. I promise.

698
00:59:28,568 --> 00:59:30,153
All right, everyone, pay attention.

699
00:59:30,236 --> 00:59:33,406
She is never alone. Got it?

700
00:59:33,448 --> 00:59:35,909
And no crowd surfing
in the record shop, please,

701
00:59:35,992 --> 00:59:38,203
thank you very much, if you don't mind.

702
00:59:38,745 --> 00:59:39,954
Daja Grace.

703
00:59:40,038 --> 00:59:42,874
- I think it's Dasia, isn't it?
- Man.

704
00:59:42,999 --> 00:59:44,334
- What?
- Look.

705
00:59:44,376 --> 00:59:46,795
- You don't need that.
- I know.

706
00:59:46,878 --> 00:59:52,384
It's just the idea of eternal sobriety
scares me very much.

707
00:59:52,717 --> 00:59:54,052
- One day at a time.
- Right.

708
00:59:54,094 --> 00:59:55,136
Yeah.

709
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:58,473
At least that's what my mom said
right before she relapsed.

710
00:59:59,057 --> 01:00:00,684
Good.

711
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:07,065
Now that is impressive.

712
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:09,567
- Coffee?
- Thank you.

713
01:00:09,943 --> 01:00:11,361
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

714
01:00:11,403 --> 01:00:15,573
The metalmark is the most
beautiful butterfly.

715
01:00:15,615 --> 01:00:18,993
And it's the most fragile,
as it only lives a week.

716
01:00:20,745 --> 01:00:22,414
Isn't that sad?

717
01:00:24,082 --> 01:00:25,333
I wanted to ask you something.

718
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:28,837
- Yeah?
- Don't get angry. It's kind of crazy.

719
01:00:28,878 --> 01:00:31,214
I love crazy. I'm insane.

720
01:00:33,216 --> 01:00:36,553
I want to write. I want to tell your story.

721
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:40,890
- You want to write my story?
- Yeah, I do.

722
01:00:41,891 --> 01:00:47,397
It's powerful and because nobody says...

723
01:00:48,523 --> 01:00:51,735
Nobody talks about all the things
that happen to you.

724
01:00:51,901 --> 01:00:52,944
- You know?
- I know.

725
01:00:53,028 --> 01:00:55,321
And I just...
I think it will help somebody.

726
01:00:57,782 --> 01:00:59,242
- Oh, God.
- You think it'll help...

727
01:00:59,325 --> 01:01:00,785
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, no, no!

728
01:01:00,869 --> 01:01:05,290
Jamie, I'm just...
You think it could help people, like...

729
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:08,043
Yeah, I do.

730
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:12,505
Okay, then do it. Sure.

731
01:01:12,547 --> 01:01:15,216
<i>Thanks for coming out to open mic night.</i>

732
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:19,304
<i>- First up is Dylan Landers. Dylan?
- What?</i>

733
01:01:20,972 --> 01:01:23,433
Shit! Did you hear that?

734
01:01:23,516 --> 01:01:25,769
Get your stuff. We're going to the front.

735
01:01:27,354 --> 01:01:29,314
Hello.

736
01:01:29,397 --> 01:01:31,566
<i>My name is Dylan.</i>

737
01:01:31,608 --> 01:01:33,151
<i>Sorry.</i>

738
01:01:33,568 --> 01:01:34,819
<i>So this is a...</i>

739
01:01:34,903 --> 01:01:38,323
<i>I've never really done this before.
This is my first time.</i>

740
01:01:38,406 --> 01:01:41,910
<i>So today, tomorrow, actually,</i>

741
01:01:41,951 --> 01:01:46,998
<i>my best friend, Renee, is going to rehab.
For drugs. And...</i>

742
01:01:47,082 --> 01:01:49,459
<i>Not, like, to get drugs, but...
'Cause they don't...</i>

743
01:01:49,542 --> 01:01:50,877
<i>I don't think they have drugs there.</i>

744
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,380
<i>So I want to sing a song for her.</i>

745
01:01:53,421 --> 01:01:55,423
<i>It's sort of like...</i>

746
01:01:55,507 --> 01:01:58,176
<i>It's kind of like a prayer in reverse.</i>

747
01:01:58,218 --> 01:02:00,553
<i>No, it's like, it's good. Here it goes.</i>

748
01:02:08,061 --> 01:02:13,858
<i>Come up to meet you
Tell you I'm sorry</i>

749
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:19,948
<i>You don't know how lovely you are</i>

750
01:02:20,031 --> 01:02:25,954
<i>I had to find you
Tell you I need you</i>

751
01:02:26,037 --> 01:02:31,126
<i>Tell you I set you apart</i>

752
01:02:31,835 --> 01:02:37,382
<i>Tell me your secrets
Ask me your questions</i>

753
01:02:37,841 --> 01:02:42,470
<i>Oh, let's go back to the start</i>

754
01:02:43,263 --> 01:02:48,226
<i>Nobody said it was easy</i>

755
01:02:49,394 --> 01:02:53,648
<i>It's such a shame for us to part</i>

756
01:02:54,649 --> 01:02:59,988
<i>Nobody said it was easy</i>

757
01:03:00,739 --> 01:03:06,578
<i>No one ever said
It would be this hard</i>

758
01:03:08,747 --> 01:03:12,709
<i>I'm going back to the start</i>

759
01:03:27,265 --> 01:03:29,142
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey.

760
01:03:29,225 --> 01:03:30,352
That was a fun day, right?

761
01:03:30,393 --> 01:03:32,896
Yeah, fun, fun.

762
01:03:35,482 --> 01:03:37,317
Flying out?

763
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:41,029
Yeah, I'm taking
the big friendly giant tomorrow.

764
01:03:41,071 --> 01:03:42,947
No, don't steal my line.

765
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:51,373
I have a little... I have a little...
I just wanna give you something.

766
01:03:51,414 --> 01:03:53,958
- But it's weird.
- All right.

767
01:03:54,042 --> 01:03:56,378
Okay. Ready?

768
01:03:57,545 --> 01:03:59,714
Here, hold it like...

769
01:04:00,548 --> 01:04:01,883
Okay.

770
01:04:03,218 --> 01:04:07,639
I don't trust myself with it and I...

771
01:04:07,722 --> 01:04:10,350
I would like to throw it away.

772
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:16,106
But maybe you can do that instead.

773
01:04:26,616 --> 01:04:29,744
- Okay.
- Thank you.

774
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:36,876
- Let's take a ride.
- Okay.

775
01:04:53,184 --> 01:04:54,728
Come on.

776
01:04:58,189 --> 01:05:01,317
Can you believe
he still drives the same stupid truck?

777
01:05:01,401 --> 01:05:04,696
Sean is a janitor now. He's a real winner.

778
01:05:04,738 --> 01:05:06,906
- Take the first one?
- No.

779
01:05:07,532 --> 01:05:08,700
Take it.

780
01:05:09,117 --> 01:05:10,201
Come on, we're not doing this.

781
01:05:10,243 --> 01:05:11,403
- Take it!
- This is stupid. No.

782
01:05:11,411 --> 01:05:14,247
- I'm not doing this. I wanna go back, please.
- Hey, Renee.

783
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:17,083
You need this. You don't even understand
how bad you need this.

784
01:05:17,167 --> 01:05:19,753
I don't need this. I don't need this.
I don't need this.

785
01:05:19,836 --> 01:05:21,338
He took you from us.
He took you from everything.

786
01:05:21,379 --> 01:05:22,380
Stop!

787
01:05:22,464 --> 01:05:24,966
Please, I can't. I can't right now.

788
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:29,012
Please. Just forget it.
It was a long time ago.

789
01:06:09,386 --> 01:06:11,221
You don't have to...

790
01:06:15,517 --> 01:06:17,060
Thank you.

791
01:06:18,228 --> 01:06:20,063
I've got something for you.

792
01:06:21,898 --> 01:06:24,067
I got this at three months sober.

793
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:26,277
It's your watch thingy.

794
01:06:26,361 --> 01:06:27,737
Here, look.

795
01:06:29,406 --> 01:06:31,116
No way.

796
01:06:33,034 --> 01:06:37,414
"God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

797
01:06:37,497 --> 01:06:41,459
"the courage to change the things I can
and the wisdom to know the difference."

798
01:06:42,836 --> 01:06:44,170
You have to wind it every day.

799
01:06:44,212 --> 01:06:48,049
It's a little reminder
to take it one day at a time.

800
01:06:48,091 --> 01:06:50,218
You're like my fairy godmother.

801
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:52,345
Did you just call me a fairy?

802
01:06:52,387 --> 01:06:53,888
Yes.

803
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:02,480
Don't say it. Don't say a word.

804
01:07:04,441 --> 01:07:06,901
- Love you.
- Love you too.

805
01:07:18,496 --> 01:07:21,082
- How you doing?
- Better.

806
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:23,084
Good. Welcome back.

807
01:10:49,165 --> 01:10:50,709
<i>In our local hero report,</i>

808
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:54,587
<i>one young man is making a difference
in the lives of young people in crisis.</i>

809
01:10:54,671 --> 01:10:58,299
<i>Jamie Tworkowski wrote a story
about a local girl, Renee Yohe,</i>

810
01:10:58,383 --> 01:11:01,720
<i>who was suffering from addiction,
depression and bipolar disorder</i>

811
01:11:02,345 --> 01:11:04,848
<i>and got clean with the help of her friends.</i>

812
01:11:04,889 --> 01:11:08,977
<i>He posted her story on Myspace titled
"To Write Love On Her Arms"</i>

813
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:10,603
<i>and it quickly went viral.</i>

814
01:11:10,687 --> 01:11:12,105
<i>Remembering her scars,</i>

815
01:11:12,188 --> 01:11:16,526
<i>he printed the unusual logo on T-shirts
to raise money for her treatment.</i>

816
01:11:16,568 --> 01:11:19,029
<i>Friends in bands
started to wear our T-shirts.</i>

817
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:20,989
<i>You know, they were really
generous with their platform.</i>

818
01:11:21,072 --> 01:11:23,867
<i>Then something crazy
and unexpected happened.</i>

819
01:11:23,908 --> 01:11:26,202
<i>Thousands of young adults found the page</i>

820
01:11:26,244 --> 01:11:30,457
<i>and wrote about their own struggles
of depression, addiction and isolation,</i>

821
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:35,086
<i>and an online community was born
and became a legitimate social movement.</i>

822
01:11:35,170 --> 01:11:37,839
<i>Jamie now runs the nonprofit organization</i>

823
01:11:37,881 --> 01:11:41,468
<i>that is committed to helping others
with similar issues worldwide.</i>

824
01:11:41,551 --> 01:11:44,721
<i>Renee Yohe has become a role model
for many young people</i>

825
01:11:44,804 --> 01:11:48,224
<i>and will be speaking at an event
this Friday in Orlando.</i>

826
01:11:49,351 --> 01:11:52,103
You know, most people are celebrities
before they go into rehab.

827
01:11:53,063 --> 01:11:55,857
Next week no one will care. Don't worry.

828
01:11:55,899 --> 01:11:59,402
Well, if this is McKenna's doing,
I'll skin him alive.

829
01:12:00,403 --> 01:12:01,738
Did you give him this?

830
01:12:01,821 --> 01:12:05,241
No, no. That's a story
he'll have to tell you.

831
01:12:08,661 --> 01:12:09,996
Oh, boy.

832
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,624
Yeah? You ready for this?

833
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,126
I don't know.

834
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:16,836
Six months is not a long time.

835
01:12:17,379 --> 01:12:19,047
Thanks, Doc.

836
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:23,301
Hello.

837
01:12:48,993 --> 01:12:50,745
Renee...

838
01:12:52,706 --> 01:12:55,306
Sorry, we didn't know if the surprise
was appropriate or anything.

839
01:12:56,042 --> 01:12:57,502
What's going on?

840
01:12:57,544 --> 01:12:59,921
- It's like so intense.
- I know.

841
01:13:00,005 --> 01:13:03,800
I have a manager now
and we're playing some shows

842
01:13:03,883 --> 01:13:06,443
- and I really want you to come because...
- Shut up. Oh, my God!

843
01:13:06,803 --> 01:13:08,555
Dylan's a pro.

844
01:13:08,638 --> 01:13:10,849
Where's McKenna?

845
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:12,726
He's taking a break sort
of from everything.

846
01:13:12,767 --> 01:13:13,810
What do you mean?

847
01:13:13,893 --> 01:13:15,812
His band fired him.

848
01:13:16,271 --> 01:13:17,397
- No way.
- Yes.

849
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:18,732
But he'll be back in a few days.

850
01:13:18,815 --> 01:13:21,192
- He's just sorting things out.
- Okay.

851
01:13:21,234 --> 01:13:22,235
Is it my fault?

852
01:13:22,318 --> 01:13:24,237
- No, no, no.
- 'Cause he was babysitting me?

853
01:13:24,279 --> 01:13:25,280
- No.
- Yeah, it is.

854
01:13:25,363 --> 01:13:27,615
- No. I would seriously tell you...
- Hi.

855
01:13:27,699 --> 01:13:29,951
I'm going to go make out with your dad.

856
01:13:34,414 --> 01:13:37,417
You want some sobriety cake?

857
01:13:38,376 --> 01:13:40,587
- It's so good.
- Is it?

858
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:42,990
This is my second piece,
but I ate the first one in hiding.

859
01:13:47,385 --> 01:13:48,762
Are you okay?

860
01:13:49,721 --> 01:13:50,972
Yeah.

861
01:13:51,681 --> 01:13:53,767
I'm good. It's just a little weird.

862
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:55,769
- I know.
- You know what I mean?

863
01:13:56,978 --> 01:13:58,980
'Cause what are we celebrating, that I'm...

864
01:13:59,064 --> 01:14:02,025
It's like, "You're normal, yay, party!"

865
01:14:02,567 --> 01:14:04,444
Well, if you don't want anybody
to be here right now,

866
01:14:04,527 --> 01:14:05,570
- we can get them out.
- Oh, my God, Jess. Jess.

867
01:14:05,612 --> 01:14:06,613
Renee!

868
01:14:07,447 --> 01:14:08,448
Hey!

869
01:14:09,574 --> 01:14:10,700
Hi!

870
01:14:10,742 --> 01:14:12,243
I'm so proud of you.

871
01:14:13,745 --> 01:14:15,372
- Thank you.
- How are you feeling?

872
01:14:15,413 --> 01:14:17,999
- Much better.
- You look amazing.

873
01:14:19,876 --> 01:14:23,672
Thanks for all your notes
and sending me letters and all that stuff.

874
01:14:23,713 --> 01:14:25,048
Of course, of course, of course.

875
01:14:25,131 --> 01:14:27,133
We have so much to catch up on.

876
01:14:27,217 --> 01:14:28,343
- It has been a whirlwind!
- I know.

877
01:14:28,385 --> 01:14:29,469
I want you to come down to the office,

878
01:14:29,552 --> 01:14:32,972
I want you to see everything that
you've created and what's happened.

879
01:14:33,765 --> 01:14:34,974
It's beautiful.

880
01:14:35,058 --> 01:14:36,643
That'd be great, yeah, I'd love to.

881
01:14:36,726 --> 01:14:38,770
Maybe respond to a few e-mails, yeah?

882
01:14:39,312 --> 01:14:40,563
Sounds good.

883
01:14:40,647 --> 01:14:41,773
- Okay?
- Yeah.

884
01:14:41,898 --> 01:14:44,776
Babe, come meet Renee!

885
01:14:44,943 --> 01:14:45,985
Hi.

886
01:14:46,444 --> 01:14:48,655
It's so nice to finally meet you!

887
01:14:48,738 --> 01:14:51,449
Renee, this is Amanda. She's my girlfriend.

888
01:14:51,533 --> 01:14:54,077
She's down from New York
for the show on Friday.

889
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,579
Yeah. Jamie talks about you all the time.

890
01:14:56,663 --> 01:14:58,456
He's so proud of you.

891
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:01,835
And I can't wait for the event on Friday.
It's going to be amazing.

892
01:15:03,628 --> 01:15:05,880
Are you looking forward to it? Are...

893
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:10,719
Well, anyway,
it's nice to finally meet you,

894
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:13,722
and I can't wait for Friday, and...

895
01:15:13,763 --> 01:15:14,803
And we've got to catch up.

896
01:16:34,302 --> 01:16:36,179
- It's like it happened overnight, you know?
- Yeah, yeah.

897
01:16:36,388 --> 01:16:38,765
We've had this office
for a couple months now.

898
01:16:39,933 --> 01:16:43,687
In this room we put some of the letters
from, you know, our followers.

899
01:16:43,728 --> 01:16:44,729
Hey, Renee.

900
01:16:44,813 --> 01:16:45,814
- Hey.
- Hey, babe.

901
01:16:45,897 --> 01:16:46,898
That's cool.

902
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:48,692
They write to us, you know.
They just want to have a voice.

903
01:16:48,733 --> 01:16:49,734
Yeah.

904
01:16:49,818 --> 01:16:52,654
Come on in.
These people just want someone to talk to,

905
01:16:53,154 --> 01:16:54,989
someone to hear them.

906
01:16:55,073 --> 01:16:56,074
Yeah.

907
01:16:56,116 --> 01:16:57,492
And they feel safe with you.

908
01:16:57,575 --> 01:16:59,536
So just click on the messages.

909
01:17:01,204 --> 01:17:03,289
<i>- Andvoilà.
- Yeah.</i>

910
01:17:03,373 --> 01:17:05,917
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

911
01:17:06,668 --> 01:17:08,712
- Be right across the hall.
- All right.

912
01:17:14,759 --> 01:17:18,596
<i>I can't do life anymore.
I just want to die.</i>

913
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:20,515
<i>Everything's so messed up.</i>

914
01:17:21,474 --> 01:17:23,727
I don't have friends like you.

915
01:17:26,021 --> 01:17:28,023
Why are you so special?

916
01:17:29,441 --> 01:17:34,237
I'm writing this 'cause
nobody knows about the scars on my chest.

917
01:17:36,656 --> 01:17:38,616
Who am I supposed to tell?

918
01:17:42,245 --> 01:17:44,706
<i>Hi. My...</i>

919
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:48,126
When I was 12, my dad molested me.

920
01:17:48,209 --> 01:17:49,794
Okay.

921
01:18:01,723 --> 01:18:05,393
It's the only time that I agree.
I know. It was so embarrassing.

922
01:18:05,435 --> 01:18:07,354
You know what,
would you at least put on your robe

923
01:18:07,395 --> 01:18:09,115
before you run for the paper every Tuesday?

924
01:18:09,189 --> 01:18:10,607
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes?

925
01:18:22,243 --> 01:18:24,245
Then the band will play
and I'll introduce you.

926
01:18:24,329 --> 01:18:27,332
And then you speak.
Have you written something up?

927
01:18:27,957 --> 01:18:29,959
- About what?
- Your story.

928
01:18:32,212 --> 01:18:35,090
It's kind of a personal story.
Don't you think?

929
01:18:39,427 --> 01:18:42,430
Hey, guys, would you mind helping me
put the T-shirts in the van?

930
01:18:44,891 --> 01:18:46,643
You got a sec?

931
01:18:49,354 --> 01:18:51,231
What's going on?

932
01:18:54,275 --> 01:18:57,112
What... Why did you write this?

933
01:18:58,113 --> 01:18:59,406
For you.

934
01:19:01,908 --> 01:19:06,579
For me? Really? How... All this is for me?

935
01:19:07,247 --> 01:19:08,581
Yeah.

936
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:11,918
I'm sitting at the airport

937
01:19:14,754 --> 01:19:16,881
and I can't stop thinking about you.

938
01:19:17,757 --> 01:19:19,843
You and these five days.

939
01:19:20,176 --> 01:19:24,889
I just started writing and writing,
and my heart poured out and it was beautiful.

940
01:19:24,931 --> 01:19:26,766
And it was about you.

941
01:19:27,976 --> 01:19:34,024
So then why didn't you just send it to me?

942
01:19:34,899 --> 01:19:38,069
Because I thought about Zeke,

943
01:19:38,111 --> 01:19:40,321
and I thought about all the people,

944
01:19:41,948 --> 01:19:44,367
all the people
who were in similar circumstances

945
01:19:44,409 --> 01:19:50,206
and I wanted people to know
that recovery is possible.

946
01:19:54,544 --> 01:19:58,631
What if I'm not recovered?

947
01:20:00,717 --> 01:20:02,719
What are you talking about?

948
01:20:04,763 --> 01:20:05,972
Talk to me. This is...

949
01:20:06,056 --> 01:20:07,849
This is me, all right, you know?

950
01:20:07,891 --> 01:20:09,726
Put all this aside.

951
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,812
Do you need to go back to rehab?

952
01:20:15,231 --> 01:20:18,068
No. I'm fine.

953
01:20:18,109 --> 01:20:19,110
Renee, we can pay for it.

954
01:20:19,194 --> 01:20:21,529
I'm fine.

955
01:20:23,323 --> 01:20:27,911
- I just am nervous. Just nervous.
- Yeah.

956
01:20:31,748 --> 01:20:34,751
All right. I'm here if you need me.

957
01:22:14,559 --> 01:22:17,520
- Hey! Hey.
- Hey!

958
01:22:17,562 --> 01:22:18,897
How are you feeling?

959
01:22:20,023 --> 01:22:21,524
I just wanted to see you
and talk about some...

960
01:22:21,566 --> 01:22:23,777
It's a bit of a mess. Just hang on a sec.

961
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:27,447
I'm just going to clean up.
I've been... Had the... Find some...

962
01:22:28,156 --> 01:22:29,949
So you got fired, huh?

963
01:22:30,033 --> 01:22:31,673
- What's that, sorry?
- You just got fired

964
01:22:31,701 --> 01:22:34,621
and now you have to sell your loft
because of me.

965
01:22:34,704 --> 01:22:37,082
No, no. It's just... It's...

966
01:22:37,123 --> 01:22:39,584
It's too big anyway for me.

967
01:22:39,668 --> 01:22:43,338
I'm just... No, I've got, you know,
irons in the fire...

968
01:22:44,130 --> 01:22:45,674
What's wrong with you?

969
01:22:45,715 --> 01:22:47,133
I'm just excited, you know?

970
01:22:47,217 --> 01:22:51,554
I've got a lot of stuff
going on at the moment.
It's really a busy time for me.

971
01:22:51,638 --> 01:22:52,681
Yeah.

972
01:22:53,223 --> 01:22:54,641
Look what I got.

973
01:22:55,183 --> 01:22:56,267
Your watch.

974
01:22:56,726 --> 01:22:58,311
- And it... Yeah?
- Yeah.

975
01:22:58,395 --> 01:22:59,396
All right.

976
01:22:59,437 --> 01:23:02,148
Well, listen, I'm so sorry I couldn't come,

977
01:23:02,232 --> 01:23:06,945
and, you know, have a chance to...

978
01:23:07,028 --> 01:23:10,907
To come get you out, meet you out of there.

979
01:23:11,991 --> 01:23:17,414
Listen, I'm sick.
So maybe don't catch germs from that.

980
01:23:18,039 --> 01:23:22,168
So what did you want to talk to me about?
What's the trouble?

981
01:23:34,431 --> 01:23:39,602
I wanted to know how you stayed sober
for so... Such a long time.

982
01:23:46,651 --> 01:23:49,487
- You just take it one day at a time, you know?
- Yeah?

983
01:23:49,571 --> 01:23:52,991
Easy, easy does it is what we...

984
01:23:56,077 --> 01:23:58,538
You know, you have to wind this or else...

985
01:23:59,330 --> 01:24:01,416
I told you, you have to wind it.

986
01:24:03,793 --> 01:24:06,755
You forgot to hide a
bottle over there, buddy.

987
01:24:14,554 --> 01:24:16,264
I lost the band.

988
01:24:19,601 --> 01:24:24,147
I'm eating crap. I lost the band.
I'm not doing great, okay?

989
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:26,066
It's been a tough time.

990
01:24:39,913 --> 01:24:41,122
Okay.

991
01:24:41,206 --> 01:24:43,541
I don't have anybody, okay?

992
01:24:44,376 --> 01:24:45,877
I don't either.

993
01:24:48,296 --> 01:24:49,297
Renee, come on!

994
01:24:54,469 --> 01:24:56,096
Renee!

995
01:25:11,611 --> 01:25:13,571
- Hey! Have you guys seen Renee?
- Hey!

996
01:25:13,655 --> 01:25:14,698
- No.
- No.

997
01:25:14,739 --> 01:25:16,199
I've been trying to get
a hold of her all day.

998
01:25:16,241 --> 01:25:17,283
Why, did something happen?

999
01:25:17,909 --> 01:25:20,704
You know, it's nothing.
She just wasn't herself yesterday.

1000
01:25:20,745 --> 01:25:23,039
- Did she say anything?
- No.

1001
01:25:23,081 --> 01:25:26,001
I'm going to call her.
I'm sure it's fine. I'm going to call her.

1002
01:26:08,418 --> 01:26:11,755
Hey! My truck! What the hell?

1003
01:26:13,631 --> 01:26:15,342
You have a kid?

1004
01:26:16,301 --> 01:26:17,719
Boy or girl?

1005
01:26:18,845 --> 01:26:22,557
- Boy or girl?
- A little girl. A girl.

1006
01:26:51,961 --> 01:26:53,630
Oh, God!

1007
01:26:55,757 --> 01:26:57,384
Look who it is! Yohe!

1008
01:26:58,343 --> 01:27:02,889
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Check this out, check this out!

1009
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:06,768
This is my new favorite shirt.
I love wearing this thing.

1010
01:27:07,477 --> 01:27:09,062
So does that mean that you're...

1011
01:27:09,104 --> 01:27:12,982
'Cause you're wearing the shirt,
you're sober 'cause...

1012
01:27:13,066 --> 01:27:15,944
Me? No, I mean,
I don't like getting high in your shirt.

1013
01:27:16,027 --> 01:27:19,406
So there's some internal conflict going on.

1014
01:27:19,447 --> 01:27:23,576
Man. You! You sobriety celebrity you!

1015
01:27:23,618 --> 01:27:25,745
Dude, I don't want to talk about this.

1016
01:27:26,121 --> 01:27:28,373
Aren't you supposed to be
at that party right now?

1017
01:27:28,415 --> 01:27:31,668
I'm the last person who should be
telling anyone how to live their lives.

1018
01:27:32,210 --> 01:27:34,921
I was in rehab for six months.

1019
01:27:36,047 --> 01:27:39,926
I am exactly the... I'm exactly the same.

1020
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:44,889
The thing that people love about you
and your story is that it's honest.

1021
01:27:45,682 --> 01:27:49,269
You're sad. Shit happens.

1022
01:27:50,395 --> 01:27:52,564
You're trying, okay?

1023
01:27:52,647 --> 01:27:54,899
Even if it's just a little bit.

1024
01:27:55,775 --> 01:27:57,861
Where else you got to go tonight?

1025
01:28:01,614 --> 01:28:05,118
<i>I wrote this story for Renee because</i>

1026
01:28:07,704 --> 01:28:10,749
<i>I wanted to believe in
the happily ever after.</i>

1027
01:28:10,832 --> 01:28:13,209
<i>Now, her story isn't unique,</i>

1028
01:28:13,293 --> 01:28:15,503
<i>but she is.</i>

1029
01:28:17,589 --> 01:28:21,718
<i>The way she speaks the truth.</i>

1030
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:24,387
<i>The way she sees the world.</i>

1031
01:28:26,389 --> 01:28:29,351
<i>And I pray that never changes.</i>

1032
01:28:30,101 --> 01:28:33,730
<i>Now, Renee was
supposed to be here tonight.</i>

1033
01:28:34,689 --> 01:28:36,733
<i>But she couldn't make it.</i>

1034
01:28:37,359 --> 01:28:41,738
<i>But in the spirit of Renee,</i>

1035
01:28:41,988 --> 01:28:45,742
<i>we should open it up to you out there.</i>

1036
01:28:46,534 --> 01:28:49,412
<i>Now, we've got some friends who are
going to be bringing microphones around.</i>

1037
01:28:49,496 --> 01:28:54,542
<i>They're going to bring
them down the aisles.
Let's stand up and tell our story.</i>

1038
01:29:00,006 --> 01:29:01,591
<i>Go ahead.</i>

1039
01:29:04,135 --> 01:29:08,098
<i>The first time I ever thought about suicide</i>

1040
01:29:08,348 --> 01:29:12,560
<i>was around the same time
I started pulling my hair.</i>

1041
01:29:12,769 --> 01:29:16,773
<i>Two weeks ago,
I did a search for ways to end it</i>

1042
01:29:16,856 --> 01:29:21,236
<i>and I found the To Write Love site.</i>

1043
01:29:21,736 --> 01:29:23,405
<i>I read Renee's story.</i>

1044
01:29:24,656 --> 01:29:28,660
<i>I wasn't used to hearing
other people hurting.</i>

1045
01:29:29,244 --> 01:29:32,497
<i>Her story helped me find hope.</i>

1046
01:29:34,582 --> 01:29:36,042
<i>Thank you.</i>

1047
01:29:39,587 --> 01:29:41,131
<i>Anybody else?</i>

1048
01:29:42,048 --> 01:29:43,091
<i>Hi.</i>

1049
01:29:44,509 --> 01:29:45,969
<i>Hello.</i>

1050
01:29:47,387 --> 01:29:48,763
<i>That was...</i>

1051
01:29:49,556 --> 01:29:51,141
<i>Thank you.</i>

1052
01:29:52,308 --> 01:29:55,770
<i>I'm not sure what to say,
but my friends are here</i>

1053
01:29:57,856 --> 01:30:01,526
<i>and I know they're worried about me.</i>

1054
01:30:03,194 --> 01:30:07,490
<i>They think I'm better, and I'm not.</i>

1055
01:30:08,408 --> 01:30:12,370
<i>But I think that's okay,</i>

1056
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:15,707
<i>'cause I have them.</i>

1057
01:30:24,799 --> 01:30:26,926
<i>Secrets make you sick.</i>

1058
01:30:27,719 --> 01:30:33,141
<i>Somebody that I love told me that
and it's true.</i>

1059
01:30:36,686 --> 01:30:40,398
<i>'Cause when I finally
asked for help, I got it.</i>

1060
01:30:42,567 --> 01:30:47,530
<i>And when my friend asked me for help,
I just...</i>

1061
01:30:51,743 --> 01:30:54,412
<i>I didn't give it to him.</i>

1062
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:02,295
<i>I think what this whole thing is about</i>

1063
01:31:06,549 --> 01:31:08,551
<i>is what I'm going to go do</i>

1064
01:31:12,972 --> 01:31:15,517
<i>right now. So thanks.</i>

1065
01:31:17,727 --> 01:31:19,396
<i>Thank you.</i>

1066
01:31:24,442 --> 01:31:25,735
<i>Anybody else?</i>

1067
01:31:34,244 --> 01:31:35,662
McKenna?

1068
01:32:20,832 --> 01:32:23,626
Clever. Clever.

1069
01:32:24,002 --> 01:32:26,713
Conrad said I should ask you about that.

1070
01:32:33,678 --> 01:32:35,221
My father put me in prison.

1071
01:32:37,807 --> 01:32:42,937
Well, selling a shitload of cocaine
put me in prison,

1072
01:32:44,105 --> 01:32:46,149
but my father turned me in.

1073
01:32:48,443 --> 01:32:51,237
I think he knew
it was the only way I'd get clean.

1074
01:32:55,241 --> 01:32:58,453
And I hated him for it, I hated him for it.

1075
01:32:59,788 --> 01:33:02,082
And I told him in a letter.

1076
01:33:04,042 --> 01:33:07,212
And in return, he sends me this.

1077
01:33:10,048 --> 01:33:12,342
I never knew why he didn't drink,

1078
01:33:14,552 --> 01:33:17,430
and, well, it turns out,
"Like father, like son."

1079
01:33:18,890 --> 01:33:20,850
He died while I was in there.

1080
01:33:25,063 --> 01:33:28,608
So "James Terrance McKenna."

1081
01:33:32,028 --> 01:33:35,031
So I guess
that's all your questions answered.

1082
01:33:37,909 --> 01:33:39,077
I'm sorry.

1083
01:33:39,703 --> 01:33:42,914
- It's all right. It was a while ago.
- No.

1084
01:33:42,956 --> 01:33:45,709
I'm sorry I left you.

1085
01:33:51,214 --> 01:33:52,882
I called Conrad.

1086
01:33:53,883 --> 01:33:55,135
You did?

1087
01:33:55,885 --> 01:34:00,223
Yep. Asked him if he had
any room at the inn.

1088
01:34:02,017 --> 01:34:05,145
I told him I'd prefer to get sober
in an all-girls facility.

1089
01:34:08,273 --> 01:34:11,026
<i>We all wake to the human condition.</i>

1090
01:34:11,067 --> 01:34:14,487
<i>We wake to mystery and beauty,</i>

1091
01:34:14,571 --> 01:34:17,699
<i>but also to tragedy and loss.</i>

1092
01:34:17,741 --> 01:34:20,994
<i>Millions of people know
that pain is very real.</i>

1093
01:34:22,412 --> 01:34:25,373
<i>We also know that hope is real.</i>

1094
01:34:25,457 --> 01:34:30,128
<i>When Renee came to us,
we became her hospital, her church.</i>

1095
01:34:30,211 --> 01:34:33,089
<i>Coming alive to meet her needs,</i>

1096
01:34:33,173 --> 01:34:35,550
<i>to write love on her arms.</i>

1097
01:34:35,592 --> 01:34:37,427
<i>Rescue is possible.</i>

1098
01:34:37,761 --> 01:34:39,929
<i>God is still in the business of redemption.</i>

1099
01:34:41,681 --> 01:34:45,226
<i>The first step to recovery
is the hardest to take.</i>

1100
01:34:45,977 --> 01:34:47,729
<i>But it's worth it.</i>

1101
01:34:48,521 --> 01:34:51,066
<i>Life is worth fighting for.</i>

1102
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:09,959
Hi, I'm Jamie Tworkowski,
founder of To Write Love on Her Arms.

1103
01:35:10,043 --> 01:35:11,443
Millions of people around the world

1104
01:35:11,461 --> 01:35:15,215
struggle with depression, addiction,
self-injury and suicide.

1105
01:35:15,298 --> 01:35:17,384
There's a stigma that
if you struggle with these things,

1106
01:35:17,467 --> 01:35:19,386
you're not supposed to talk about it.

1107
01:35:19,427 --> 01:35:22,555
But I'm here on behalf of people
literally choosing to stay alive

1108
01:35:22,597 --> 01:35:25,058
and choosing to believe
that life can change.

1109
01:35:25,141 --> 01:35:27,936
If you're struggling, or if there's
someone you're concerned about,

1110
01:35:28,019 --> 01:35:29,729
please know you're not alone.

1111
01:35:29,813 --> 01:35:32,899
It's okay to be honest
and it's okay to ask for help.

1112
01:35:32,982 --> 01:35:37,112
You are living a story, and it's our hope that
you will never give up on that story.

1113
01:35:38,279 --> 01:35:40,281
To Write Love on Her
Arms still exists today.

1114
01:35:40,365 --> 01:35:42,909
We respond to every single message
that comes in,

1115
01:35:42,951 --> 01:35:45,453
and there are more ways than ever
to get involved.

1116
01:36:03,722 --> 01:36:05,724
<i>I called you from the hospital</i>

1117
01:36:05,765 --> 01:36:08,143
<i>You didn't pick up the phone</i>

1118
01:36:08,226 --> 01:36:11,730
<i>I was left alone
with the crazy fishes</i>

1119
01:36:11,771 --> 01:36:14,357
<i>Swimmin' in their senseless circle</i>

1120
01:36:14,399 --> 01:36:16,401
<i>All of us together</i>

1121
01:36:16,484 --> 01:36:20,071
<i>Smashing our faces in the glass</i>

1122
01:36:20,113 --> 01:36:24,743
<i>This repetition's definition
could be insanity</i>

1123
01:36:24,784 --> 01:36:27,579
<i>But flip a switch
and check the sky as I go</i>

1124
01:36:27,662 --> 01:36:31,708
<i>Just gotta keep trying</i>

1125
01:36:31,791 --> 01:36:35,462
<i>Had to keep trying</i>

1126
01:36:37,213 --> 01:36:41,384
<i>I had said that I'd be better</i>

1127
01:36:41,426 --> 01:36:44,512
<i>Told you I'd never fall again</i>

1128
01:36:45,555 --> 01:36:50,226
<i>Countless times
and you believed me</i>

1129
01:36:50,268 --> 01:36:53,897
<i>But I let you down again</i>

1130
01:36:53,938 --> 01:36:58,568
<i>I'm not asking you to answer</i>

1131
01:36:58,651 --> 01:37:01,363
<i>I can tell this is the end</i>

1132
01:37:01,404 --> 01:37:07,118
<i>So I'm goin' to leave you at the tone</i>

1133
01:37:14,876 --> 01:37:19,047
<i>I know that I won't spend
my whole life in a cell</i>

1134
01:37:19,130 --> 01:37:23,093
<i>I will keep fighting
and so be righting myself</i>

1135
01:37:23,176 --> 01:37:27,389
<i>One foot right in front
of the other as they say</i>

1136
01:37:27,472 --> 01:37:29,224
<i>Even when it's dismal</i>

1137
01:37:29,265 --> 01:37:31,559
<i>I'm guaranteed change</i>

1138
01:37:31,643 --> 01:37:35,730
<i>I had said that I'd be better</i>

1139
01:37:35,772 --> 01:37:39,859
