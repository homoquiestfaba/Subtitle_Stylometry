1
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:36,782
Not happening, Ro.

2
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:38,033
Sis, please.

3
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:39,660
I said no, and I meant it.

4
00:01:39,684 --> 00:01:42,495
Seriously?
I'm 16, not five.

5
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,205
I don't know these kids.

6
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,582
And I need you to take Mary
to dance class on Friday.

7
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,334
I've got two clients
for a color and cut.

8
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,879
Yeah, you always have clients.

9
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:53,048
How do you think I pay
for your baseball equipment?

10
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:54,717
Okay, do you think money
grows on trees?

11
00:01:54,741 --> 00:01:56,259
That's fine. I'll just be
the laughing stock

12
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,326
of all the juniors.

13
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,932
Look.
I'm sorry, Ro.

14
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:03,726
We need the money.

15
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,477
I'm two years behind
on property taxes.

16
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,355
The bills keep coming in.

17
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,299
Maybe we should start thinking
about selling Dad's Mustang.

18
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,529
It would solve
a lot of problems.

19
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,489
We're not selling Dad's car,
all right?

20
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,908
I won't go to the stupid party.

21
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:21,617
It's no biggie, really.

22
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,747
It's not stupid to want
to hang out with your friends.

23
00:02:24,771 --> 00:02:26,749
Hey, maybe I can move
my appointments?

24
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:28,876
No, I mean, I've already started
looking at other jobs, so...

25
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,627
Your job is to keep
a grade-A average

26
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,213
and to get into a good college
on scholarship.

27
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,009
You can't keep working
yourself to the bone.

28
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:39,594
I'm fine.

29
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,304
We've been going
strong for three years now.

30
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,098
Why change it?

31
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:45,433
Maybe it's because you haven't
been with a friend

32
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,811
or on a date since...

33
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:50,898
I can't even remember the last
time I've seen you with a guy.

34
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:52,941
I see guys all the time.

35
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:55,425
Yeah, your yoga class?
It doesn't count.

36
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,706
Take care of yourself out there.

37
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:01,075
You can count on it.

38
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:02,658
- Bye.
- Oh, wait, wait.

39
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,185
Mary, come here.
Your shirt's on backwards.

40
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,580
Arms up.

41
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,540
Good morning, San Francisco.

42
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,878
Let's talk baseball,
specifically Trent Fox.

43
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:15,338
It's been a few weeks since
the bad boy hitter

44
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,381
from the Ports
tore his hamstring

45
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:19,134
in the last game of the season.

46
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:21,302
The injury doesn't
seem to have stopped him.

47
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,805
Brian?

48
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:23,806
Well, Gerry,
there are those who say

49
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,515
Trent Fox hasn't peaked.

50
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,439
Wake up, you piece of shit.

51
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,506
Ross?

52
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:37,903
What are you doing here?

53
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:39,612
Six weeks of
recuperation, Trent,

54
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,115
and this is what you have
to show for it?

55
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:42,407
You living in filth, man.

56
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,118
Drinking? Smoking?

57
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:45,618
Have you even gone
to therapy yet?

58
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,995
Ross, of course I have.

59
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:48,579
Three days a week.

60
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,665
Three other days
I lift weights with Clay.

61
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:54,002
Are you supposed
to be lifting weights. Huh?

62
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:56,839
What about strengthening,
flexibility, stretching?

63
00:03:56,863 --> 00:03:59,424
Doc recommended daily
yoga classes for you, Trent.

64
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:04,179
You have got to
snap out of it, kid.

65
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:05,889
I mean, is this what
you do with your time?

66
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,515
Hell, I'm surprised
you have one of your little

67
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,792
girlfriends up in here warming
your bed right now.

68
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:14,172
Really?

69
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,274
Maybe.

70
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:19,485
Shit.
Unbelievable.

71
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:23,489
It's always the talented
ones, too.

72
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,409
Pills, liquor

73
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,103
and endless fucking women.

74
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:31,790
What else, Trent?

75
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:34,584
What the hell else?
Huh?

76
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,004
I don't owe you
any explanations.

77
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:38,629
I'm on medical leave.

78
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,215
The hell you don't!

79
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:42,258
The way I see it,
you got one of two choices.

80
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,929
Either get your shit together
or lose your contract.

81
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,680
And with the way
that you've been hitting,

82
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:51,291
you're looking at an offer
of 100 mil for five years.

83
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,480
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

84
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,941
Jesus.

85
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:00,861
Look, man.

86
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:03,529
Coach wants you ready
by spring training.

87
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,866
I'll lay off the booze
and the late nights.

88
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:09,410
And you'll go to the therapy
and the yoga.

89
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,872
Yoga? Come on.

90
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:14,166
Trent, you will go to a class
or I swear by everything holy,

91
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,251
I will drag you there
my damn self.

92
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:18,544
Fine. I'll go.

93
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,713
When?

94
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,090
Tomorrow.

95
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:23,842
I'll go tomorrow.

96
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:25,010
Promise?

97
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:26,326
A man of my word.

98
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:30,957
Prove it.

99
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,573
Hi, Audrey.
So good to see you.

100
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,891
Oh, hi.

101
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,676
Um... feel free to
get into a child's pose

102
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,940
and begin your deep breathing.

103
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:17,020
Hi. I'm Genevieve or Viv.

104
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,189
Is this your first class?

105
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,899
Trent Fox.

106
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:24,027
I'm here for rehabilitation.

107
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,487
Pulled hamstring, right?

108
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,447
Torn.

109
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,117
How did you know that?

110
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:33,954
My brother is a huge Ports fan.

111
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:37,790
I can't believe you're here.
Rowan is going to flip.

112
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:38,833
Who's Rowan?

113
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:41,110
My brother, the Ports fan.

114
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:47,217
Anyway, I have an extended
mat for you here

115
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,970
because you're so hard.

116
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:52,288
I mean big.

117
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,351
Tall.

118
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,751
You're tall.

119
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,254
Okay.

120
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,735
Follow along as best as you can
and back off if anything puts

121
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,654
too much pressure
on the hamstring.

122
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,033
And we can talk after class,
if you like.

123
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:14,619
I think I'd like that
very much, Gumdrop.

124
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,495
Gumdrop?

125
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,873
Your lips are pretty in pink.

126
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,691
Reminds me of a sugar coated
cherry gumdrop.

127
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,904
Oh.

128
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:28,466
Hello, class.

129
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,969
Please sit on your bottoms.

130
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:34,722
Press your seat into the mats.

131
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,539
Bring your hands
to heart center.

132
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,271
Let's close our eyes and begin

133
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:44,690
by setting our intentions
for today's yoga class.

134
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,343
What is it that you want
out of today's practice?

135
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:06,070
Come up.

136
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,701
Breathing as you rise.

137
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:18,891
Warrior Two.

138
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,726
Arms straight.

139
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,336
Look at the wall.

140
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:28,818
Windmill your arms
into downward dog.

141
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,570
Feet shoulder-width apart.

142
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,847
There you go.

143
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,186
Just going to grab your hips.

144
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:42,665
Oh...

145
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,066
That feels like heaven.

146
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,696
Got a long way to go,
but we'll get you there.

147
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:00,582
The light in me bows
to the light in you.

148
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:04,961
Thank you, everyone.

149
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,789
That was fine.

150
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,899
Could we do that again,
privately?

151
00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:28,836
Private classes?

152
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,339
Whenever you're available,
I'm down.

153
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:34,592
Oh, well, if you can pay,
I'm available after this class

154
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:35,968
every weekday.

155
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,180
There's a room
open from 10:30 to noon.

156
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:39,264
Which day would you like?

157
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,598
All of them.

158
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,016
Could you be more specific?

159
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,977
I would like all of your
time from 10:30 to noon,

160
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,856
every day of the week
until the end of the month.

161
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,858
Every weekday?

162
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,694
Doc says I need to do yoga
five times a week.

163
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,095
For once, I'm
feeling cooperative.

164
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,521
Did that fine man hit on you?

165
00:10:05,523 --> 00:10:06,606
Kind of.

166
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,252
Well, he's beautiful.

167
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,777
And you've been alone
far too long.

168
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,340
Oh, really?

169
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:15,591
Oh, don't you have a
class to teach, Luna?

170
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,451
Don't you have a
man to hunt down?

171
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,013
Actually, I don't have
to hunt him down

172
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,349
because we have private lessons

173
00:10:22,373 --> 00:10:25,017
every weekday
for the next month.

174
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,812
He wants you!

175
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,897
To help him recuperate.

176
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,174
Oh. Mm-Hmm.
Yeah, sure.

177
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:36,070
Bye, silly.

178
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:41,159
Ross.

179
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:43,953
Well, I'm recovering
from my first yoga class.

180
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,663
Will miracles never cease.

181
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:49,124
I booked private sessions
10:30 to noon every morning.

182
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,626
Don't book a meeting.

183
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,255
Roger that.
Roger that. Hey, don't dip out.

184
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,280
Oh, I wont.

185
00:10:56,282 --> 00:10:58,050
Trent.

186
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,387
Don't fuck your yoga instructor.

187
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:02,264
- No promises.
- You need her.

188
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:04,224
- I do.
- To teach you.

189
00:11:04,248 --> 00:11:07,101
- And maybe more.
- Trent, come on, man.

190
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,727
There's just something
about this one.

191
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,062
I don't give a damn.

192
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,356
I don't want to hear
all of that.

193
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,731
Trent, just keep going.

194
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,024
Okay. Okay. I know I got
this one on lock.

195
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,426
Trent, don't fuck her, man.

196
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:18,737
Goodbye, Ross.

197
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:19,762
Trent!

198
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,308
Guy's a fucking rabbit.

199
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,108
Hi, Trent.

200
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,487
Hey.

201
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:38,990
What can I get for you?

202
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:42,887
Just finished class?

203
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,763
- Yes.
- Was it Mila or Genevieve?

204
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,433
Viv.

205
00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:48,017
- Ah.
- Yeah.

206
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,437
- She's pretty, huh?
- She is.

207
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:51,896
Well, I'm Dara.

208
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,939
I teach meditation
every morning at 7 a.m.

209
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,150
If you ever want to connect
to your higher self.

210
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,485
- Really?
- Yeah.

211
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,194
So, what are you doing
working here?

212
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,488
My parents own the bakery.

213
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:01,947
Everyone has to make a living.

214
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,243
And I love it here. So..

215
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:07,287
I'll take two of
the cinnamon rolls

216
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:10,706
and three of those baby milks.

217
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,875
I think they should come
in adult sizes.

218
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,295
I know.

219
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:16,986
Are you having it
for here or to go?

220
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,469
I'll stay here.

221
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:24,219
Oh, thanks.
I'll bring it to your table.

222
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,912
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

223
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,435
Oh, it's Trent Fox.

224
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:31,627
Hi.

225
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,824
Thank you.

226
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,225
Keep it real.

227
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,836
Hey, Gumdrop.

228
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,262
Wow.

229
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,535
Finally.

230
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,309
I was worried
you might be into chicks.

231
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,456
What?

232
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,040
Yesterday.

233
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,502
I worked them out like a
mad man in spring training,

234
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:39,193
and you didn't even
bat an eyelash.

235
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:43,239
So your pride got hurt a little?

236
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,036
My pride. Nah.

237
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,641
Well, perhaps you just
caught me off guard.

238
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,686
It's not every day a man
undresses in front of me.

239
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,877
Mm-hmm.

240
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:59,691
Today we're going to work
on range of motion.

241
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:01,568
See where you're at
now and determine

242
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,318
a routine that will help
loosen your limbs, okay?

243
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,612
Okay.

244
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:05,845
All right.

245
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:12,185
Push it in as far as...

246
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,835
Now, I want you to take your
right thumb

247
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,571
and put it on left nostril
and inhale. Okay.

248
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:43,610
Ah...

249
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:45,218
Ooh.

250
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,644
Okay, let's stretch.

251
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,317
Other side.

252
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:12,704
Come over and open your legs
as wide as you can.

253
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:33,642
You know how ridiculously
beautiful you are?

254
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,995
Other side.

255
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,564
Okay.

256
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:42,417
Right here.
Yeah.

257
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,528
- Oh, much better.
- Good.

258
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:52,619
Whatever it is you do,
you gotta keep doing it.

259
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,973
Like a Voodoo healer.

260
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:59,208
I don't practice magic
or voodoo of and kind.

261
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,400
Okay, um...

262
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:07,509
Now you...

263
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:19,997
Are you going to tell me

264
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,457
about the hotshot
baseball player?

265
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,084
He's nicer than I thought
he would be

266
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:28,255
for someone who has websites
dedicated to his body.

267
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,031
I mean, most women
think he's hot.

268
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,720
But what do you think?

269
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:35,304
Every time I'm around him,

270
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:39,266
I turn into a lust driven teen.

271
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,310
There are worse things.

272
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,979
I'm supposed to be helping
him recover through yoga.

273
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,900
And half the time
I'm checking him out.

274
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:48,400
So what are you going
to do about it?

275
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,944
Nothing.

276
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,112
He's a client.

277
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,865
Vivy, you know, you really...

278
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:56,200
No, no, listen,
it's not going to work

279
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:59,494
unless I just want
to have casual sex,

280
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:04,374
which, incidentally,
is what Luna suggested.

281
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,002
Well, it's been three years
since the breakup,

282
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,422
so maybe you should.

283
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:15,052
This coming from the girl
who's all study, no dating.

284
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:18,180
Does it feel right to you?

285
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:23,101
It feels like something
I just don't know what.

286
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,521
- Trent Fox.
- Trent Fox.

287
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,983
Trent Fox? Are you guys
talking about Trent Fox?

288
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:31,068
That's my freaking idol.

289
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:33,153
Go back inside.
I'll be in there soon. Okay.

290
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,280
Why? Ambers here.

291
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,283
Hey, Row, Trent's your sister's
new private client.

292
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,744
- Amber.
- What?

293
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,996
Vivy, you have got to
introduce me to him.

294
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,373
Please. I'll do anything.
I'll even mow the lawn.

295
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,083
You already mow the lawn.

296
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,734
Come on, please.

297
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,129
Okay. Maybe after a lesson,

298
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,466
we can invite him for
a treat on us at the bakery.

299
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,678
No promises.

300
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:58,972
- And you need a haircut.
- I don't.

301
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:00,765
But you're the best sister ever.

302
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,182
I got to make dinner.

303
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,101
Something special for
my awesome sister.

304
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,520
See ya, Amber.

305
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,272
You know, it's
his night to cook.

306
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,983
- Oh, of course.
- Yeah.

307
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:11,566
Yeah.

308
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,573
Um. Okay.

309
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,618
Hold that pose until I tell you
to go into child's pose, okay?

310
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:21,852
Okay.

311
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,634
Viv, what's the matter?

312
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:37,993
Child's pose.

313
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:42,389
You're acting weird.

314
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,182
Did I do something to offend?

315
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,060
No, not at all.

316
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,484
You've been more focused today
than you have been all week.

317
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,506
I was just wondering...

318
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,135
If...

319
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:00,324
Go ahead.

320
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:02,827
Well, you can totally say no,
but I was wondering

321
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:06,021
if I could take you for coffee.

322
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:10,752
Genevieve, are you
asking me out on a date?

323
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:12,670
Huh?

324
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:14,756
You're asking me out.

325
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,423
Oh, no, no, not exactly.

326
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,051
Come here.

327
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:19,927
I've been busting my brain
trying to think of a way

328
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:22,262
to ask you out,
and here you are,

329
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:27,291
looking all cute
and nervous about asking me.

330
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:36,651
That should not have happened.

331
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,029
It definitely should
have happened.

332
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:39,446
No, no, no,
you don't understand.

333
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,032
I am not asking you on a date.

334
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:43,533
But I want to take
you out on a date.

335
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:47,245
After this week's
sessions and the kiss and...

336
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,622
Pig!

337
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,374
You just hit on me and
I'm the pig?

338
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:54,294
All right. I was wondering
if after one of our sessions,

339
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,213
you would want to meet
my brother?

340
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:57,238
Your brother?

341
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,409
You have no interest
in going out with me?

342
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,081
Well, I wouldn't say that.

343
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:16,400
I will meet with you
and your brother

344
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,069
tomorrow after our session.

345
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:21,930
Then tomorrow evening,
I take you out on a real date.

346
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,534
I can't.

347
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,078
Why not?

348
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:29,122
- Clients.
- Clients?

349
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:31,022
I cut hair on the weekends.

350
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:41,490
So when are you free?

351
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:47,164
I'll have to check my schedule?

352
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:50,666
Kiss me.

353
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:06,599
You'll get back to me
on that date.

354
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,681
I can hear you
thinking over there.

355
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,643
What's got you so twisted up,
Vivy?

356
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:38,965
I am so sorry for bothering you
in whatever it is...

357
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,944
That you are doing.

358
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:45,655
You're putting off
some tumultuous vibes.

359
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,142
How do you expect
to teach a class like this? Sit.

360
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:57,667
So why are you
sitting on a desk?

361
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,212
Getting perspective.

362
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:02,089
You know, accounting
is not my strong suit.

363
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:05,200
And you have to sit on
a desk to get perspective?

364
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,930
To fully understand the problem,

365
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:12,016
it is best to give
all of yourself.

366
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,143
So I inserted myself
into the chaos

367
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:18,480
in the hopes that I find
a fix to my numbers issue.

368
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:19,857
And did you get an answer?

369
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:23,152
I did.
To ward off negativity.

370
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,760
It's beautiful.

371
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:33,561
What was the answer,
if you don't mind me asking?

372
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:37,499
To hire an accountant.

373
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:40,902
In the end, I realized I was
not needed in the equation.

374
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:43,630
Is the center doing okay?

375
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,549
Better than ever.

376
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:46,926
Speaking of...

377
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,535
I heard you had a
private lesson all week.

378
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:54,808
Oh, whatever's going on
in that head of yours

379
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:57,144
is torturous to watch.

380
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,296
Please share with me.

381
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,691
Your mama's not here.

382
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:05,694
God bless her beautiful
young soul.

383
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,345
You've got to work
with what you have.

384
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,326
Okay.

385
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:16,454
My private client is
professional baseball player

386
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,540
Trent Fox.

387
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,127
And yesterday
I kissed him right here.

388
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:23,878
I mean, not right
here in Studio B,

389
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:27,091
but now he wants to date me,

390
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:30,743
and I'm going to
introduce him to Row, and...

391
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,763
I shouldn't have kissed him.

392
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,849
Why not?

393
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:39,603
Because he's a player
and a client.

394
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:42,522
We do not place
rules on sexual attraction.

395
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,691
We have tantric workshops here.

396
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:47,694
Still, it's not professional.

397
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:50,780
Love, sex, and passion
usually aren't.

398
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:54,952
But if this man gets your heart
and root chakra humming,

399
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:56,769
why not enjoy yourself?

400
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,316
And what if I fall
in love with him?

401
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:05,611
Worse things have happened
to you, my dear.

402
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:11,926
And what if he just wants sex
and not a relationship?

403
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,161
Did he tell you that?

404
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:15,621
Not exactly.

405
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:19,643
He wants to take me on a date.

406
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:22,063
And other things.

407
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:25,215
And do you want
these other things to?

408
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,343
Oh, yeah.

409
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,781
Well, looks like
you have your answer.

410
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,848
No, I don't.
I'm more confused than ever.

411
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:42,457
If you want to spend time
with him, casual or otherwise,

412
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,168
go ahead.

413
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:46,461
You're a grown woman.

414
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,798
Now, let's do a
quick chakra readjust.

415
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,990
Can't have you spreading
this bad juju.

416
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,688
I was trying meditation.

417
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:08,109
Think I might take that hot
chick's class this weekend.

418
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:10,152
Hot chick?

419
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:12,779
Works in the bakery.

420
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:13,929
Dara.

421
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:16,391
Then, you know she's hot.

422
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:21,579
We will begin today
with sun salutation.

423
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,290
What did I do now?

424
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:24,666
If you think
my friends are so hot,

425
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,043
why don't you ask them out?

426
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:27,068
You're jealous.

427
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:30,505
You can date whoever you want.

428
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,175
There are some lovely ladies
in and out of here.

429
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:34,658
What am I going to do?

430
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:40,182
Okay, boss, put me
through the paces.

431
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:42,726
I got a hot date
that I don't want to miss.

432
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:53,737
Vivy!

433
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:55,322
Mary, what are you doing here?

434
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:56,449
Are you feeling okay?

435
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:58,451
Totally fine.
Minimum day.

436
00:25:58,475 --> 00:25:59,993
Can I have a donut?

437
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,786
Yeah, sure.

438
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,581
Rowan, I'm sorry. I should
have checked the schedule.

439
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:06,040
Don't worry about it.

440
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,085
I don't mind taking home
little my sister.

441
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:09,527
Yeah, but still...

442
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:12,465
Rowan, this is my client.

443
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:14,799
- Trent Fox.
- Client?

444
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,050
- What's up, buddy?
- Oh my God.

445
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,761
Rowan Harper.

446
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:20,097
You're, like, the best center
in baseball history.

447
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:21,182
You play?

448
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:22,599
Yeah, well, high school.

449
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:24,559
Got the record for
most hits on my team.

450
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,894
Any scouts at the games?

451
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,896
Perhaps, but
I don't really care.

452
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,482
According to his coach, he's got

453
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:31,525
the best batting average
in the state of California.

454
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:33,943
Really?
That's how I got my start.

455
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,405
Well, I'm going
to Berkeley, so...

456
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:37,822
That's not the plan, bro.

457
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,241
You're going to take
the best package

458
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:41,243
for your baseball career
and your education.

459
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:43,620
Can we talk about this later?

460
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:45,747
It's better financially
for us to stay local.

461
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,082
Plus I already told coach
to talk to scouts.

462
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,918
You mean scouts are
already asking about you?

463
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:51,295
Yeah. All right.

464
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:53,297
Can we get treats now?
Trent's waiting.

465
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:55,673
Trent will wait.
Right, Trent?

466
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,592
Yeah, babe.
Do what you gotta do.

467
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,594
Wait, are y'all dating?

468
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:00,678
- Yes.
- No.

469
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,182
Don't put thoughts in his head.

470
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:04,517
I can't believe this.

471
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:06,143
After all they've done for you?

472
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:07,561
You are going
to set up a meeting

473
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:08,562
with your coach and me,
and we're going

474
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:10,356
to discuss your options.

475
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,568
How about we order some treats
and we can chat about this?

476
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:16,069
You can tell me
what you've been told,

477
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:17,279
and hopefully I can offer
you some advice.

478
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:18,929
Yeah.

479
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,826
I know what he's doing.

480
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,078
And what's that?

481
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:26,913
He thinks he's doing me a favor.

482
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:28,856
Giving up his dream
to stay here and help.

483
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:35,129
Where are your parents
in all of this?

484
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:38,259
Our parents died in a car
accident three years ago,

485
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:41,452
and I've been taking care
of them alone ever since.

486
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:45,890
And now he's going
to throw away his dreams

487
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,394
to stay here and help me.

488
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:51,813
Babe, I'm...
I'm so sorry.

489
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,005
It's okay.
Let's just go.

490
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:03,157
- There you go, sweetie.
- Thank you.

491
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,182
You're welcome, babe.

492
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:13,276
Hey, Rowan.

493
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:15,819
Hey, look at me.

494
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:19,341
I know you want
to help this family

495
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,968
and you do so much.

496
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:23,887
A man takes care of his family.

497
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,347
It's what Dad would have wanted.

498
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:26,764
Yeah. And you want to be
a pro baseball player,

499
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,100
and you are so close.

500
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,603
What about you?

501
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:31,853
You were almost done with school

502
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:34,105
when you had to
help me and Mary.

503
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:37,568
I'll still get
my cosmetology license, okay?

504
00:28:37,592 --> 00:28:41,696
I'll open my own salon one day.
My dream is not dead.

505
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,115
Every baseball game
that you play just proves

506
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:47,620
that even though Mom
and Dad are gone too soon,

507
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:49,871
we're still alive.

508
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,290
And we're fighting.
And you know what?

509
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:54,418
- I'm happy.
- I'm happy, Vivy.

510
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:56,794
And I get to go
to dance classes.

511
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,340
And you are a beautiful dancer.

512
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:02,133
And maybe you'll go pro
one day, too.

513
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,010
And I want to see
you out on the field

514
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:07,889
giving Trent Fox
a run for his money.

515
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,933
You dream pretty big, Vivy.

516
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:11,560
And so should you.

517
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:14,020
You don't need to
get a job right now.

518
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:16,981
I told Coach, I'm looking to
play at Berkeley and UC Davis.

519
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,525
Mary will be 10.

520
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:20,486
She'll need her big brother.

521
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,552
Always.

522
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,221
Thank you, Rowan.

523
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:01,568
Hey.

524
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:02,843
Hi.

525
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:07,931
You're early.

526
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,186
Can you hold this pose?

527
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:18,443
Yeah.

528
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,506
Well, that's good.

529
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,216
Because we're going to
test that right now.

530
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,576
Okay.

531
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:37,670
Oh!

532
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,526
Yeah.

533
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:45,844
Oh. Yeah. Oh.

534
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,413
That was...

535
00:30:54,437 --> 00:30:55,688
Holy moly.

536
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:02,463
We should try
some other positions.

537
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:04,548
My buddy Dash teaches
a tantric class.

538
00:31:04,572 --> 00:31:05,572
Well, sign us up.

539
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,873
You okay?

540
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,505
What is it?

541
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,401
I don't know what it is
about you.

542
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:27,111
You bring out
something wild in me.

543
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:31,365
Something wild and
wildly unprofessional.

544
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,242
Next time, we'll
be more private.

545
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,578
Next time?

546
00:31:34,602 --> 00:31:37,038
Oh, yeah.

547
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:39,106
You and me Friday night.

548
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:43,878
Plan to stay over.

549
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:44,903
I can't.

550
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:48,341
Why not?

551
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:51,428
Two kids under my care.

552
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:54,455
I'm not one of your baggage
free floozies, okay?

553
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:59,460
Babe. I'm sorry.

554
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,823
I shouldn't have assumed.

555
00:32:10,847 --> 00:32:12,888
How about I take you out
tomorrow like we planned?

556
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,457
Okay.

557
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,966
Hey, Viv.

558
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,051
What are you doing standing out
here looking all sexified?

559
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,847
I'm waiting for my date.

560
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:37,932
Would he happen to be tall?

561
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,225
And could he possibly be

562
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:41,435
the sexiest baseball
player alive?

563
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,146
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, you suck.

564
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,857
I was so going to hit on him.

565
00:32:44,881 --> 00:32:46,941
He is scrum-diddly-umptious.

566
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,861
I know.

567
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:12,425
- Gumdrop.
- Hi.

568
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:14,678
Dara.
How you doing, beautiful?

569
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:17,723
Nice.
Not as good as you guys.

570
00:33:17,747 --> 00:33:20,391
You aura is just so red
and shining so bright.

571
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,435
It's blinding me.

572
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:24,938
Wow. Well...
You two have fun with that.

573
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:26,314
Catch you next week for
a couple of pastries, yeah?

574
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,107
Sure thing, handsome.

575
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,527
- See ya, Viv.
- Bye, love.

576
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:32,779
What does a red
aura mean, anyway?

577
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:38,075
It means love, passion,
hunger, charged energy.

578
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,870
- Hmm.
- Stuff like that.

579
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:40,937
She has a gift.

580
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,965
You ever been here before?

581
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:54,407
I spend almost all
my time in Berkeley.

582
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,596
So no baseball games?

583
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,932
I've haven't been to a
professional game in years.

584
00:33:59,956 --> 00:34:02,016
We'll have to see about
getting you into the stands

585
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,876
for one of my games, won't we?

586
00:34:05,586 --> 00:34:07,128
Don't say things you don't mean.

587
00:34:10,758 --> 00:34:13,152
Oh, this is a nice place.

588
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:16,113
Yeah. Got to feed my woman.

589
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,056
Your woman?

590
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:20,893
Tonight you are.

591
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:25,206
Two of the usual?

592
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,481
Thank you.

593
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,967
You look beautiful.

594
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:36,826
Oh, like Dara?

595
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:41,055
You're jealous?

596
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,473
Just when a guy
you're on a date with

597
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,100
calls you beautiful

598
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:45,852
right after saying the same
thing to your friend,

599
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:48,169
it kind of waters
down the impact.

600
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:52,609
Duly noted.

601
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:54,778
Now, what's up
with the siblings.

602
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:56,971
I mean, why are they
your responsibility?

603
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:01,702
Well, my grandparents are dead.

604
00:35:01,726 --> 00:35:04,913
Both my parents
were only children.

605
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:06,414
I have my next door
neighbor, Amber,

606
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,332
who's also my best friend
and her grandma.

607
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,751
They help when they can.

608
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:12,004
- And you stopped school?
- Yeah.

609
00:35:12,028 --> 00:35:15,214
I was three months shy of
getting my cosmetology license

610
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,091
when the accident happened.

611
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:20,136
And I have to take
the last semester,

612
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,514
and it's expensive.

613
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,474
Your parents didn't
leave you any money?

614
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,268
Most of it went to the house.

615
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:31,815
Property tax, the upkeep takes
most of what I can make.

616
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,482
Then you have utilities.

617
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:39,072
Three mouths to feed,
baseball gear, dance class.

618
00:35:39,096 --> 00:35:40,197
That takes the rest.

619
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,826
So... thank you.

620
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,811
I teach yoga and cut hair
in my garage.

621
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:54,087
Do people with money
make you uncomfortable?

622
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:55,797
What would make you say that?

623
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:56,822
No reason.

624
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:00,969
I know money is money.

625
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:03,013
My parents were
doing financially well

626
00:36:03,037 --> 00:36:04,305
before they died.

627
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:07,266
My dad was a big time lawyer,

628
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,936
but they were only 40.

629
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,479
- You parents were only 40?
- Yeah.

630
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:15,316
They had me
when they were young.

631
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,361
So what about you, any siblings?

632
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:21,447
My parents wanted a full house,
but they just had me.

633
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:23,491
My mom wanted more,
but she couldn't.

634
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:25,284
Oh.

635
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,870
Tell me about your parents.

636
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:28,537
My parents are great.

637
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:32,208
Dad owns Fox Mechanics,
which was my grandfather's,

638
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:35,087
and Gramps still
works there every day.

639
00:36:35,111 --> 00:36:37,839
And what's your mom like?

640
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:40,092
Ma's the shit.

641
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:42,343
She's crazy in her own way.

642
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:45,179
But she worked for the Oakland
school district for 30 years,

643
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,432
and now she just loves
cooking, painting,

644
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:51,543
gardening and riling up my dad.

645
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,338
You are lucky.

646
00:36:56,757 --> 00:36:57,758
I am.

647
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,823
And, you know, they take
every opportunity

648
00:37:02,847 --> 00:37:04,556
to boast about their son.

649
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:07,869
They worked their butts off

650
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:11,081
to put me into every baseball
clinic under the sun.

651
00:37:11,105 --> 00:37:13,207
See, that's
what I want for Owen.

652
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,544
He thinks this family
is his responsibility,

653
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:19,630
and it's not.

654
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,967
And I can talk to him for you.
Man to man.

655
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:23,033
You okay?

656
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:25,577
Yeah, I'm fine.

657
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:29,598
Really?
You would do that.

658
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:30,623
Yeah.

659
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:37,816
Oh, you really are a nice guy.

660
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,567
A nice guy?

661
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:40,633
Yeah.

662
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:44,345
You know what else is nice?

663
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:46,639
Yeah?

664
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:50,727
I only live two floors up.

665
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,416
Hmm. Well, I take
it all back.

666
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,234
Maybe you're not
really a nice guy.

667
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:44,883
How long have you lived here?

668
00:38:44,907 --> 00:38:46,324
Five years.

669
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,848
Pretty empty for five years.

670
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:53,874
I haven't spent too much
time in any place.

671
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,816
You don't have any roots,
do you?

672
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,028
I'll give you a tour.

673
00:39:05,052 --> 00:39:07,113
What?

674
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:21,418
That's a beautiful picture.

675
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,922
- You think so?
- Yeah.

676
00:39:23,946 --> 00:39:27,217
- Local artist.
- Yes. Me.

677
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:29,701
- Really?
- Yeah.

678
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:32,805
Well, that's something unique.

679
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:33,871
- Do you like?
- Yeah.

680
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:40,378
- What was that?
- My phone.

681
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:43,942
Row?

682
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:45,484
Vivy, I heard a noise.
Lots of them.

683
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,028
I think someone's
trying to break in.

684
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:49,197
- Should I call the cops?
- Is the alarm on?

685
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:51,448
Yeah, but the light in
the yard hasn't gone off.

686
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,076
Okay, we'll be right there

687
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,660
and call the cops
if anything happens.

688
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:58,396
Okay, turn right here.
Yeah, right here.

689
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:06,463
Rowan? Mary!

690
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,697
Genevieve!

691
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,013
- Someone's here.
- Get out of here!

692
00:40:13,037 --> 00:40:14,454
Get out of here!

693
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,581
God.

694
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:21,229
They're gone now.

695
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:23,231
The cops will be
here any second.

696
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,720
All right, I'll go talk to them.

697
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,245
I just got here
with the owner of the house.

698
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:38,621
Anyone else in the house?

699
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:40,456
One female adult, two children.

700
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,125
I haven't checked
the place out yet,

701
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:44,085
but there's two guys
I saw run out the back door.

702
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:45,989
All right, wait here, sir.
We'll check it out.

703
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:09,717
Anything I can do?

704
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:15,140
Yeah. We've got to secure
this window for the night.

705
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,394
Got tools and wood in the shed.

706
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:20,687
Lead the way.

707
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,461
And when they got
back from vacation...

708
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,922
Everything was safe and sound

709
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:32,883
and they lived happily
ever after.

710
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,927
It's a great story.

711
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:37,704
- All right, bedtime.
- Okay.

712
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:39,706
Love you.

713
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,377
Let's get you tucked in.

714
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:46,754
Sweet dreams, baby girl.

715
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:57,450
Hey, Rowan.

716
00:41:57,474 --> 00:42:02,288
I just wanted to say thank you
for being here tonight

717
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:03,289
and taking care of your sister.

718
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:05,291
Anytime, Vivy.

719
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:08,585
Just because I'm 16 doesn't
mean that I'm not capable.

720
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,213
Thank you, Rowan.

721
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:12,424
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

722
00:42:12,448 --> 00:42:14,259
Pancakes tomorrow?

723
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:16,094
- Sure.
- Sweet.

724
00:42:16,118 --> 00:42:17,158
- Good night.
- Good night.

725
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:22,599
And where's your room?

726
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,584
Oh, you're not staying
here tonight.

727
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,522
Excuse me?

728
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,108
The kids will hear you.

729
00:42:30,132 --> 00:42:33,026
They already know I'm here.

730
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,238
Look, the house is not secure.

731
00:42:35,262 --> 00:42:36,947
I'm not going anywhere
until it is.

732
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:40,808
And I don't think you
want me to go either.

733
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,812
Just go to sleep.

734
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:47,607
You're the boss, babe.

735
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:51,445
Just sleep.

736
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,259
Okay.

737
00:42:56,283 --> 00:42:59,035
Kiss me, woman so I can sleep.

738
00:43:00,454 --> 00:43:01,930
What?

739
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,123
I want my goodnight kiss.

740
00:43:05,334 --> 00:43:08,146
- Are you serious?
- As a heart attack.

741
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:09,171
Oh...

742
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:12,299
Fine.

743
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:28,541
Okay, stop. Seriously.

744
00:43:28,565 --> 00:43:29,690
Not tonight, okay?

745
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:31,943
Fine.

746
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,385
Well, then hold my hand.

747
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:40,618
I want to feel you close.

748
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:40,613
Hiya, sport.

749
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:42,240
Hiya, ma.

750
00:44:42,264 --> 00:44:45,201
I was thinking of coming over
for dinner tomorrow.

751
00:44:45,225 --> 00:44:47,412
- Really?
- Really.

752
00:44:47,436 --> 00:44:49,581
I want to get your advice
on something.

753
00:44:49,605 --> 00:44:51,416
Everything alright with the leg?

754
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,083
- Yeah.
- Jobs okay?

755
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:57,963
Jobs fine. Doing yoga,
if you can believe it.

756
00:44:57,987 --> 00:45:00,490
So. Is it a woman?

757
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:05,762
Yes, ma.
It's a woman.

758
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,848
Hallelujah.

759
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:09,850
Come on.

760
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:31,480
Ready for this?

761
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:36,526
- Cool.
- Do it again.

762
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,130
It's so cool.

763
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,257
Thank you, milady.

764
00:45:41,281 --> 00:45:42,342
Can you do it with eggs?

765
00:45:42,366 --> 00:45:43,384
Of course.

766
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:44,968
Will you teach me?

767
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,846
Yes. And the ladies love
a guy that can cook.

768
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:51,141
Okay, don't teach him
your player moves.

769
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,352
He's a good boy.

770
00:45:52,376 --> 00:45:56,063
Don't knock my moves, Gumdrop.

771
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:59,983
Besides, a man should know
how to feed himself.

772
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,635
- Not here.
- Ugh.

773
00:46:05,305 --> 00:46:08,534
Mmm.
Coffee kisses.

774
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:11,161
Uh, we're starving.

775
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,705
Pancakes!

776
00:46:12,729 --> 00:46:14,499
Can Trent stay over
every Saturday

777
00:46:14,523 --> 00:46:16,334
so we can make his pancakes?

778
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:18,461
I just might do that.

779
00:46:18,485 --> 00:46:21,547
Uh, Trent, can I talk
to you for a second?

780
00:46:21,571 --> 00:46:22,572
Yeah, always.

781
00:46:25,659 --> 00:46:26,909
Please don't confuse them.

782
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:35,687
Genevieve, I don't know
what this is between us,

783
00:46:35,711 --> 00:46:37,730
but it seems like all
the rules have changed

784
00:46:37,754 --> 00:46:40,148
when it comes to you.

785
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,173
How?

786
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:45,697
Can we just see where this goes?

787
00:46:45,721 --> 00:46:47,179
Take this one day at a time?

788
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,269
Yum!

789
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:57,333
- All right.
- Go ahead, eat up.

790
00:46:57,357 --> 00:46:58,751
So good.

791
00:46:58,775 --> 00:47:01,795
All, right.
Pancake syrup for the lady.

792
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:04,507
You got to try it with syrup.

793
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:07,050
Right, from there...
Clean it off and put it back.

794
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,052
I brought
sandwiches and lemonade.

795
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,077
Oh.

796
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,808
You're dirty.

797
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:15,958
You're beautiful.

798
00:47:17,586 --> 00:47:19,980
Ugh, get a room.

799
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,442
You know, you guys really
don't have to fix the car.

800
00:47:22,466 --> 00:47:24,444
Nothing beats
working with a bro.

801
00:47:24,468 --> 00:47:25,695
Right, Ro-man?

802
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:27,821
Yeah. We're doing man's work.

803
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,055
Leave us be, woman.

804
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:37,271
Mmm. Delicious.

805
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:42,252
And tonight's the night.

806
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,087
No more waiting.

807
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,447
You're on.

808
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,997
The kids are staying
at John and Kerry's.

809
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:57,249
Good.

810
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:02,230
I can't believe
you did all this.

811
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,900
Well, my goal was to
get in your panties.

812
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:06,486
Is it working?

813
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:08,738
Oh, yeah, it's working.

814
00:48:08,762 --> 00:48:11,323
Eat first.
Sexy time later.

815
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:14,410
- Okay.
- Okay.

816
00:48:14,434 --> 00:48:17,245
Ooh...

817
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:19,582
What should we drink to?

818
00:48:19,606 --> 00:48:20,857
To fucking you silly.

819
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:24,044
Works for me.

820
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,434
You strip everything
away, Genevieve.

821
00:49:50,906 --> 00:49:52,281
Let me.

822
00:50:50,006 --> 00:50:51,173
Ma?

823
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:58,531
Hiya, Ma.
This looks good.

824
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,408
I told you I'd hire a gardener.

825
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:02,787
I have a system.

826
00:51:02,811 --> 00:51:04,371
Let me get a look at my sport.

827
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:05,665
Mm-hmm.

828
00:51:05,689 --> 00:51:07,750
You look happy today.

829
00:51:07,774 --> 00:51:11,086
Maybe that has something to
do with your new lady friend?

830
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:12,713
I think I'm happy.

831
00:51:12,737 --> 00:51:14,674
You think?
Mm-hmm.

832
00:51:14,698 --> 00:51:17,802
I mean, Genevieve
is different, Ma.

833
00:51:17,826 --> 00:51:19,386
Oh?

834
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,722
She's not the type
of woman that you spend an

835
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:24,224
evening with
and never see again.

836
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:28,771
And so far, you've only dated
women for a single evening.

837
00:51:28,795 --> 00:51:30,940
Pretty much.

838
00:51:30,964 --> 00:51:33,233
Are you going to see this
one again?

839
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:35,903
You could technically
say I'm dating her.

840
00:51:35,927 --> 00:51:37,822
So what's the problem?

841
00:51:37,846 --> 00:51:39,513
I don't know how to date her.

842
00:51:41,016 --> 00:51:43,076
I mean, you know,
the women I'm around

843
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,662
aren't exactly the type

844
00:51:44,686 --> 00:51:46,603
that you bring home
to meet the parents.

845
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,792
Oh, my God.

846
00:51:49,816 --> 00:51:51,543
You're falling in love with her.

847
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:53,671
It's too early
and it's complicated.

848
00:51:53,695 --> 00:51:57,465
You know,
I see her every day at Yoga.

849
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,635
Last night,
we took the next step.

850
00:51:59,659 --> 00:52:02,638
You're not used to wanting
to continue to see a woman

851
00:52:02,662 --> 00:52:04,914
after you've taken
that physical step.

852
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,895
Yeah.

853
00:52:09,919 --> 00:52:12,732
Have you asked her out again?

854
00:52:12,756 --> 00:52:16,443
Not exactly, but I'm gonna
see her tomorrow at yoga.

855
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:18,821
She's making such a
difference with my leg.

856
00:52:18,845 --> 00:52:20,238
Perfect.

857
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:22,490
Tomorrow you ask her out again.
Easy-peasy.

858
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:24,869
Oh, it's not that easy.
I mean, she's...

859
00:52:24,893 --> 00:52:28,080
- It is.
- She's got obligations.

860
00:52:28,104 --> 00:52:29,271
Warrior two.

861
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:45,830
Okay.
Down into triangle pose.

862
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:52,336
Swing the arms down
into lunge...

863
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:57,150
right foot back into
downward dog

864
00:52:57,174 --> 00:53:02,031
with your feet
shoulder width apart.

865
00:53:02,055 --> 00:53:04,390
Forward into plank.

866
00:53:11,856 --> 00:53:15,168
- Oh.
- Are you hurting?

867
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,963
Gumdrop, you keep touching
that spot on my hips,

868
00:53:17,987 --> 00:53:20,800
I'm not going to be
responsible for my actions.

869
00:53:20,824 --> 00:53:21,825
Sorry.

870
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,202
It's better that way.

871
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:30,083
Frankly, I'm relieved.

872
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:32,752
Child's pose.

873
00:53:35,004 --> 00:53:36,364
What do you mean
you're relieved?

874
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:41,028
You've been tense
and acting weird.

875
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:43,488
I just thought maybe you were...

876
00:53:43,512 --> 00:53:45,014
ready to move on.

877
00:53:48,893 --> 00:53:51,956
Genevieve, this is
more than one night.

878
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,999
You know it.
I know it.

879
00:53:54,023 --> 00:53:56,251
Hell, my mom knows it.

880
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:57,837
Your mom?

881
00:53:57,861 --> 00:54:00,505
Yeah.

882
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:02,406
She wanted to invite you
for dinner Sunday.

883
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:05,510
But I just didn't know
how to ask you.

884
00:54:07,996 --> 00:54:12,893
Wow, Trent. Sorry.
I just... I thought...

885
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:16,212
You're you, and I'm me.

886
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:29,976
Please come and meet my mom.

887
00:54:32,812 --> 00:54:35,231
Let's move on.
Stand up.

888
00:54:37,233 --> 00:54:39,903
Ma. We're here.

889
00:54:43,907 --> 00:54:45,550
All right. Come this way.

890
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:47,052
We're here!

891
00:54:47,076 --> 00:54:48,761
Hello, dears.

892
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:51,306
Oh, look at all of you beauties.

893
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:53,893
Hello, ma'am.
I'm Rowan Harper.

894
00:54:53,917 --> 00:54:55,518
This is my sister, Mary and

895
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,520
this is my elder sister,
Genevieve.

896
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,023
Thank you so much for having us.

897
00:54:59,047 --> 00:55:01,441
Oh.

898
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:04,904
You have no idea how long
I've waited to meet you.

899
00:55:04,928 --> 00:55:07,572
It is so nice to
meet you, Mrs. Fox.

900
00:55:07,596 --> 00:55:09,224
Ma, relax.

901
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:13,786
Everyone, this
is my mother, Joan,

902
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,164
and my dad, Richard.

903
00:55:15,188 --> 00:55:17,249
- Hi. Welcome.
- You can call him Rich.

904
00:55:17,273 --> 00:55:20,961
Smells amazing, Miss Fox.

905
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:24,339
We have a coloring book
and markers for Mary.

906
00:55:24,363 --> 00:55:25,507
Ooh.

907
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:27,968
Miss Mary, I love fairies.

908
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:29,719
You do?

909
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:32,764
I love when they have
purple and blue wings.

910
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:35,600
Totally. I'll color
you a picture.

911
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:37,352
Oh, what a lovely idea.

912
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:41,190
And when you're done,
I'll put it on the fridge.

913
00:55:41,214 --> 00:55:43,234
Babe, do you want
a glass of wine or a beer?

914
00:55:43,258 --> 00:55:46,111
- Oh, no, I don't.
- It's okay, Gumdrop.

915
00:55:46,135 --> 00:55:47,863
Ma's going to have some wine.
Right, Mom?

916
00:55:47,887 --> 00:55:50,199
You betcha, Sport.

917
00:55:50,223 --> 00:55:54,286
Sport. I like that.
It suits you.

918
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:57,915
Always has.
My big jock.

919
00:55:57,939 --> 00:55:59,791
Miss Mary, this is stunning.

920
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:01,709
You are an artist, for sure.

921
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,128
Thank you, Miss Fox.

922
00:56:03,152 --> 00:56:06,048
How about you
call me Grandma Fox, huh?

923
00:56:06,072 --> 00:56:09,467
I'm old enough
to be your grandma.

924
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:10,972
Do you have
any grandparents, honey?

925
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:15,891
Well, now you do.
How does that sound?

926
00:56:15,915 --> 00:56:19,710
- Sounds awesome, right, Ro?
- Of course, Mary.

927
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:25,008
Is there a restroom I could use?

928
00:56:26,926 --> 00:56:28,011
Right this way.

929
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:36,452
What happened?
Is she feeling ill?

930
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:38,122
I don't know.

931
00:56:38,146 --> 00:56:39,664
Everything seemed fine.

932
00:56:39,688 --> 00:56:41,374
And then after he asked
Mary to call you Grandma,

933
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,667
her face turned white.

934
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:45,129
Oh, shoot. It was me.

935
00:56:45,153 --> 00:56:48,590
- What do you mean?
- Too much. Too soon.

936
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:51,343
- I'll handle this.
- Okay.

937
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:00,751
Genevieve.

938
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:08,651
Hi.

939
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:11,196
Genevieve. I'm sorry.

940
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:12,739
I didn't mean to come on
so strong

941
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:14,616
with your brother and sister.

942
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,744
It's okay. It's just...

943
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:19,371
Everything's so
confusing right now.

944
00:57:19,395 --> 00:57:24,335
And here you are
being so nice and...

945
00:57:24,359 --> 00:57:26,878
It just reminds me of
a time with our own parents.

946
00:57:26,902 --> 00:57:31,008
Sweetheart. That's why we need
to spend some quality time

947
00:57:31,032 --> 00:57:32,009
getting to know one another.

948
00:57:32,033 --> 00:57:33,076
How does that sound?

949
00:57:34,327 --> 00:57:35,452
Sounds lovely.

950
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:39,790
But I don't want Mary
getting too attached.

951
00:57:41,334 --> 00:57:45,563
Mrs. Fox, I...
like your son.

952
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:49,276
More than I should, and, um...

953
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:52,363
He's admitted he's not really
the settling down type.

954
00:57:52,387 --> 00:57:56,616
In the past.
Not right now.

955
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,618
What do you mean not right now?

956
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:01,537
All I know is, dear,
you are the first woman

957
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:04,606
he's brought home to meet
his parents in a decade.

958
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:07,110
That's enough for me.

959
00:58:10,446 --> 00:58:12,407
I have pork chops prepared.
Do you like pork?

960
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:15,760
Yeah.

961
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:17,744
Then prepare to be wowed.

962
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:21,623
I already am.

963
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:27,939
I'm going to run that bath
in a minute.

964
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:29,005
Okay, fine.

965
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,009
What's this?

966
00:58:34,053 --> 00:58:36,989
Uh, property taxes.

967
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,515
It's addressed to you.

968
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,061
I know.

969
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:32,694
I'm ready.

970
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,071
Me, too.

971
00:59:37,158 --> 00:59:39,785
From now on,
we look after each other.

972
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:48,811
It's all going to be okay.

973
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,003
I can feel it.

974
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:55,651
Thank you, Dash.

975
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:57,529
I'm so happy
you found someone to help

976
00:59:57,553 --> 00:59:59,347
you unlock that root chakra.

977
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:03,743
We were thinking
about taking your tantric class,

978
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:05,496
but I'm not sure
we're ready for that.

979
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,123
I understand
and I'm happy for you both.

980
01:00:08,147 --> 01:00:10,334
It's a wonderful time
for discovery.

981
01:00:10,358 --> 01:00:11,598
Let me know when you're ready.

982
01:00:14,529 --> 01:00:15,797
Keep your hands off her.

983
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:19,218
- What are you doing?
- That hurt?

984
01:00:19,242 --> 01:00:20,552
Seriously what were
you thinking?

985
01:00:20,576 --> 01:00:22,471
I was thinking this joker

986
01:00:22,495 --> 01:00:24,473
better keep his hands
off my girlfriend.

987
01:00:24,497 --> 01:00:25,932
Dash, I am so sorry.

988
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:27,518
You're apologizing to him?

989
01:00:27,542 --> 01:00:30,061
Yeah, he's my friend
and you just hurt him.

990
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:31,646
I thought we were exclusive.

991
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:33,981
That does not mean you
get to go gorilla crazy

992
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:37,068
on every guy that comes near me.

993
01:00:37,092 --> 01:00:42,031
- Seriously?
- Viv, Honey, it's okay.

994
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:45,601
No. This is ridiculous.
You need to apologize.

995
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:53,460
You know what?
I've got a class to teach.

996
01:00:53,484 --> 01:00:55,420
Trent, I meant no harm.
Viv.

997
01:00:55,444 --> 01:00:58,738
You two can spend some
time together.

998
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:01,260
I can teach your class.

999
01:01:01,284 --> 01:01:03,303
Best fucking offer
I've heard all day.

1000
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:04,555
No, I need the money.

1001
01:01:04,579 --> 01:01:07,224
I'll teach.
You'll get paid.

1002
01:01:07,248 --> 01:01:08,225
Dash.

1003
01:01:08,249 --> 01:01:10,959
Go. Go.

1004
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:22,154
Genevieve, hold up.
Please.

1005
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:24,824
What you did back there was
completely unacceptable.

1006
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:26,868
Any man would have
responded that way.

1007
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:28,620
It was a friendly peck.

1008
01:01:28,644 --> 01:01:30,872
I can't believe you're
turning this around on me.

1009
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:32,583
You're in there kissing
Mr. Tantric,

1010
01:01:32,607 --> 01:01:33,958
and I'm the bad guy?

1011
01:01:33,982 --> 01:01:35,335
He has been really supportive

1012
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,128
during a very
difficult situation.

1013
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:38,796
What situation?

1014
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,340
The bills are piling up.

1015
01:01:40,364 --> 01:01:42,342
I'm behind on utilities
and the property tax.

1016
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:45,304
The state is sending
threatening messages.

1017
01:01:45,328 --> 01:01:48,038
I can't lose the house.
It is all we have left.

1018
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,810
Rowan and I have made a
decision to sell Dad's car.

1019
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:54,186
But you guys love that car.

1020
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,730
And my brother and sister
need a place

1021
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:57,482
to lay their head at night.

1022
01:01:57,506 --> 01:01:59,568
And hot water and electricity.

1023
01:01:59,592 --> 01:02:02,111
Something you'd
never understand.

1024
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,863
What's that supposed to mean?

1025
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:06,325
It means you take
everything for granted.

1026
01:02:06,349 --> 01:02:08,243
There are a total of what,
like two pictures in your house

1027
01:02:08,267 --> 01:02:09,952
and you've lived there
for years.

1028
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,037
I'm on the go.

1029
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:12,955
It means you don't settle down.

1030
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,416
And I'll tell you
what's going to happen

1031
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,792
- after you go back on the road.
- Enlighten me.

1032
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:18,337
You're going to find
the next sweet thing

1033
01:02:18,361 --> 01:02:19,795
and drop me like a hot rock.

1034
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:22,882
But you know me.
The me I want to be.

1035
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:25,718
The me that shows up
every day for yoga.

1036
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:28,137
I'm doing everything that I can

1037
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:30,474
to be the kind of man
that you'd fall for.

1038
01:02:30,498 --> 01:02:32,601
But why?

1039
01:02:32,625 --> 01:02:34,852
Isn't it obvious?

1040
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,355
You could have anyone.

1041
01:02:36,379 --> 01:02:37,980
Why would you ever want
to deal with all this?

1042
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:39,756
None of those women are you.

1043
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:44,904
They don't make me want
to work to be whole.

1044
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:47,532
And they sure as hell...

1045
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:49,284
don't make my heart squeeze
tighter when I see

1046
01:02:49,308 --> 01:02:52,537
a tiny glimpse of their smile
across the room.

1047
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:02,278
Gumdrop...

1048
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:12,765
Hey, look at me.

1049
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,333
I can't, I'm too embarrassed.

1050
01:03:15,543 --> 01:03:18,605
Look, I know that you're sad

1051
01:03:18,629 --> 01:03:21,566
about your dad's car, but
there's another solution.

1052
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:23,818
Let me pay the taxes.

1053
01:03:23,842 --> 01:03:25,404
Thank you for the offer.

1054
01:03:25,428 --> 01:03:27,698
But I am not
your responsibility.

1055
01:03:27,722 --> 01:03:30,367
What if I want you to be?

1056
01:03:30,391 --> 01:03:32,601
Neither of us is ready for that.

1057
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:37,773
Okay.

1058
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:42,986
Well, guess what?

1059
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:46,090
What?

1060
01:03:46,114 --> 01:03:47,824
We just made up
after our first fight.

1061
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,555
You know what that means?

1062
01:03:51,579 --> 01:03:52,972
No.

1063
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:56,142
- Are the kids home?
- No.

1064
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:57,501
Get in the car.

1065
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:09,680
Mm-hmm.

1066
01:04:17,813 --> 01:04:19,355
Turn around.

1067
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:06,529
Fuck.

1068
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:11,133
What?

1069
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:13,886
- Shit.
- What was that?

1070
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:16,347
I don't know. I'm sorry.
Okay, listen.

1071
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:20,309
I have never done that
before, but it'll be okay.

1072
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,710
I'm not on the pill, Trent.

1073
01:05:27,466 --> 01:05:28,801
Fuck!

1074
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:34,616
- Open the door.
- Go away, Trent.

1075
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,701
The hell I will.
You open this door right now

1076
01:05:36,725 --> 01:05:38,160
or I will break it down.

1077
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:39,185
You wouldn't.

1078
01:05:42,857 --> 01:05:45,376
- I can't afford to fix my door.
- I'm so sorry.

1079
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,711
No stop.

1080
01:05:46,735 --> 01:05:50,757
- Just sit.
- Get off of me, Trent.

1081
01:05:50,781 --> 01:05:53,950
- God.
- I'm sorry.

1082
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:57,179
I'll admit
I got lost in the moment.

1083
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,515
I fucked up.

1084
01:05:58,539 --> 01:05:59,850
I mean, how often
does this happen?

1085
01:05:59,874 --> 01:06:01,433
Do I need to get tested?

1086
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:03,603
Are you implying that
I'm a man whore?

1087
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:05,522
Are you admitting
that you're not?

1088
01:06:05,546 --> 01:06:09,942
I've had my fair share of
women, but no.

1089
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,246
This has never happened before.

1090
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:13,655
If I'm lying, may

1091
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:17,116
I never be able to
hit another baseball?

1092
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:18,993
I don't think I can
handle one more

1093
01:06:19,017 --> 01:06:20,769
life-changing mistake, Trent.

1094
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:28,837
We'll figure it out.

1095
01:06:28,861 --> 01:06:33,633
You know, whatever happens,
we'll deal with it.

1096
01:06:33,657 --> 01:06:36,636
And if I'm knocked up
and you're out on the road?

1097
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:40,682
Well, if you're pregnant,
then we're parents.

1098
01:06:40,706 --> 01:06:41,850
End of story.

1099
01:06:41,874 --> 01:06:43,350
Like, I'll take care of you.

1100
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:46,228
No, not this again.
I don't want your money.

1101
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:47,337
Whatever.

1102
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:28,563
Second round make-up sex?

1103
01:07:28,587 --> 01:07:31,065
Is it going to be like
this every time we fight?

1104
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:32,215
God willing.

1105
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:37,948
Okay.

1106
01:07:46,021 --> 01:07:49,166
Just a few more seconds.
You can do it.

1107
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:59,510
All right, big guy.
Relax your belly on to the mat.

1108
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:00,511
Think Christ.

1109
01:08:00,535 --> 01:08:02,973
Turn over.

1110
01:08:02,997 --> 01:08:06,267
Just let everything go,
you've worked hard today.

1111
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:09,270
Breathe into that pride.

1112
01:08:09,294 --> 01:08:14,316
Now I want you to imagine you're
looking down on yourself.

1113
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:16,527
The space around you
fills with the color.

1114
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:19,656
What color is it?

1115
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:21,156
Red.

1116
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:24,285
That's your root
chakra guiding you.

1117
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:26,746
Now I'm going to count
down from five.

1118
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:29,355
When I get to one,
you'll be awake and ready.

1119
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:35,087
Five, four,

1120
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:38,842
three, two...

1121
01:08:38,866 --> 01:08:40,760
feel your body getting lighter.

1122
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:42,511
One.

1123
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:44,848
The light in me
bows to the light in you.

1124
01:08:58,384 --> 01:08:59,970
Genevieve...

1125
01:09:03,057 --> 01:09:04,058
I'm in love with you.

1126
01:09:09,063 --> 01:09:10,146
I love you.

1127
01:09:12,107 --> 01:09:13,584
I do.

1128
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:15,169
It's too soon.

1129
01:09:15,193 --> 01:09:17,570
I was in deep savasana
and I realized something.

1130
01:09:20,991 --> 01:09:22,450
That you love me?

1131
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:27,246
You asked me to imagine a color,
and it became clear.

1132
01:09:29,124 --> 01:09:30,541
And?

1133
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:34,504
The color was red.

1134
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:41,236
I've known since the moment
I met you

1135
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:43,572
that your root
chakra was blocked.

1136
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:46,325
- Why?
- You're always on the go.

1137
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:49,244
You haven't had a committed
relationship since college.

1138
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:51,081
Now I have you.

1139
01:09:51,105 --> 01:09:52,916
So what does that mean?

1140
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:56,418
It means wherever you are
is where...

1141
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:57,694
I want to lay down my roots.

1142
01:10:01,865 --> 01:10:02,866
Really?

1143
01:10:06,078 --> 01:10:07,079
Really.

1144
01:10:15,796 --> 01:10:17,005
I love you, too.

1145
01:10:52,958 --> 01:10:54,333
I can't believe you did this.

1146
01:10:56,044 --> 01:10:57,646
You like it?

1147
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:00,066
You paid off my student loans
and enrolled me

1148
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:01,608
in my last semester.

1149
01:11:01,632 --> 01:11:02,913
I thought you wanted to finish.

1150
01:11:03,886 --> 01:11:04,887
Now you can.

1151
01:11:06,805 --> 01:11:08,932
Don't you want to open
your own salon one day?

1152
01:11:10,142 --> 01:11:12,954
Yeah.

1153
01:11:12,978 --> 01:11:15,706
Shut up and accept the present.

1154
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:18,459
Can we show Trent our gift now?

1155
01:11:18,483 --> 01:11:21,670
We all worked on it together.

1156
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:23,279
Let's do it.

1157
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:26,116
Here.

1158
01:11:30,245 --> 01:11:31,830
Oh, wow.

1159
01:11:33,123 --> 01:11:35,834
Okay...
Okay.

1160
01:11:36,877 --> 01:11:38,170
You want to help me open it?

1161
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:41,107
All right.

1162
01:11:41,131 --> 01:11:42,507
What could it be?

1163
01:11:57,940 --> 01:12:02,711
This is amazing.

1164
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:05,256
This is one of the best
presents I've ever received.

1165
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,548
I knew you would love it.

1166
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:08,533
And I love my new jazz shoes.

1167
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:12,120
Okay.

1168
01:12:14,081 --> 01:12:15,266
Okay. There's
still a bunch of presents

1169
01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:16,683
left under the tree,

1170
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:18,560
but I really want to
give Rowan his gift,

1171
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:20,897
and I am going to
be deeply offended

1172
01:12:20,921 --> 01:12:23,315
if you don't let him accept it.

1173
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:25,860
Yeah, whatever, man.

1174
01:12:25,884 --> 01:12:29,113
Now it's Christmas and birthday.

1175
01:12:29,137 --> 01:12:31,417
I don't want your sister
killing me for going overboard.

1176
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:33,432
Okay.

1177
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:37,562
Let's go outside.

1178
01:12:39,814 --> 01:12:41,233
All right.

1179
01:12:45,528 --> 01:12:47,488
Holy shit.

1180
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:50,009
Dad's 'stain?
No way.

1181
01:12:50,033 --> 01:12:52,344
Yes, way.

1182
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:53,369
Right, Mr. Harper?

1183
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:59,560
- Whoa!
- Merry Christmas, sweetheart!

1184
01:12:59,584 --> 01:13:01,687
Look at you, Mary!

1185
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:03,730
We have tons of presents
for you.

1186
01:13:03,754 --> 01:13:06,276
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas.

1187
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:09,844
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1188
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:12,698
Merry Christmas.

1189
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,765
- Hey, son.
- Merry Christmas.

1190
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:18,894
Did I do okay?

1191
01:13:20,314 --> 01:13:22,959
You did more than okay.

1192
01:13:22,983 --> 01:13:24,751
You gave us back Christmas.

1193
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:27,070
And you gave me back my life.

1194
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:32,450
- Come on.
- Okay.

1195
01:13:36,371 --> 01:13:37,913
All right.

1196
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,560
Well, it's the end of January.

1197
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:43,354
You know what that
means for baseball?

1198
01:13:43,378 --> 01:13:45,148
Not that much.

1199
01:13:45,172 --> 01:13:47,399
Well, it's a month
away from spring training.

1200
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:51,445
Could someone tell me
where is Trent Fox?

1201
01:13:51,469 --> 01:13:52,904
Brian?

1202
01:13:52,928 --> 01:13:54,240
You can normally
find him on Instagram

1203
01:13:54,264 --> 01:13:55,866
with a lovely lady
on his arm, Gerry.

1204
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:57,368
But no one's seen him.

1205
01:13:57,392 --> 01:13:58,726
What is going on?

1206
01:14:01,188 --> 01:14:03,374
Something definitely different
about you, man.

1207
01:14:03,398 --> 01:14:07,253
- An extra 10 pounds?
- No, something else.

1208
01:14:07,277 --> 01:14:09,297
You look good, dude.

1209
01:14:09,321 --> 01:14:10,631
Skin looks good.

1210
01:14:10,655 --> 01:14:13,009
You don't got those bags
under your eyes.

1211
01:14:13,033 --> 01:14:14,926
You don't got that
signature scowl.

1212
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:17,888
And the leg, man, looks good.

1213
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:20,308
I am shocked.

1214
01:14:20,332 --> 01:14:21,416
Everything's good, man.

1215
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:24,794
New chick every night, huh?

1216
01:14:26,338 --> 01:14:28,006
Dating just one woman, actually.

1217
01:14:31,385 --> 01:14:32,569
What?

1218
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:37,075
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop. You?

1219
01:14:37,099 --> 01:14:38,700
In a relationship.

1220
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:40,702
What's it to you?

1221
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:43,122
- She pregnant?
- No.

1222
01:14:43,146 --> 01:14:46,400
- What? Yeah.
- Okay. What's going on?

1223
01:14:50,528 --> 01:14:52,506
She's beautiful.

1224
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:53,965
Yoga teacher.

1225
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:58,179
She works hard,
takes care of her family.

1226
01:14:58,203 --> 01:15:01,164
For some crazy reason,
she loves me.

1227
01:15:04,126 --> 01:15:06,728
Good for you, man.

1228
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:11,049
Are you sure one woman's
really going to be enough?

1229
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:14,136
Genevieve is more than enough.

1230
01:15:18,098 --> 01:15:19,700
I figured that
when you said yoga teacher

1231
01:15:19,724 --> 01:15:21,618
that you actually
went to the classes.

1232
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:22,953
Every last one.

1233
01:15:22,977 --> 01:15:25,123
That shit is no joke.

1234
01:15:25,147 --> 01:15:28,442
It's much easier to lift weights
and run on the treadmill.

1235
01:15:30,193 --> 01:15:32,237
Yoga's not for the weak.

1236
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:35,466
Ooh!
Ooh.

1237
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:37,343
Yeah.

1238
01:15:37,367 --> 01:15:39,470
Now you sound like
your old self.

1239
01:15:39,494 --> 01:15:41,347
Hell, yeah.

1240
01:15:41,371 --> 01:15:43,123
My life is fucking amazing.

1241
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:49,604
Going to hit the Albatross pub

1242
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:52,191
with my buddy Clay to
catch up and have a few brews.

1243
01:15:52,215 --> 01:15:55,694
Don't hold dinner.
See you tonight.

1244
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:57,262
Dude, thank you.

1245
01:17:27,685 --> 01:17:29,354
Oh!

1246
01:17:34,609 --> 01:17:36,587
Hey, Foxy.

1247
01:17:36,611 --> 01:17:39,047
It's been a while since
I've seen you out and about.

1248
01:17:39,071 --> 01:17:40,591
Hey, Dawn Marie.

1249
01:17:40,615 --> 01:17:43,927
Would you mind moving that hand?

1250
01:17:43,951 --> 01:17:47,138
Now, why would I do a silly
thing like that?

1251
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:50,476
I remember you liked
what this hand could do.

1252
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:55,189
I'm sorry, darling,
but I'm a one woman man now.

1253
01:17:55,213 --> 01:17:58,132
Betcha I can make that
one woman at a time.

1254
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:01,428
One woman at a time?

1255
01:18:04,805 --> 01:18:06,724
Oh, no. Oh.

1256
01:18:10,895 --> 01:18:12,146
I can't believe you.

1257
01:18:15,483 --> 01:18:17,961
I have been up all night
needing to talk to you.

1258
01:18:17,985 --> 01:18:21,965
And here you are with
your mouth on that bimbo.

1259
01:18:21,989 --> 01:18:24,175
This is... this is
not what...

1260
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:27,221
This is not what it looks like.

1261
01:18:27,245 --> 01:18:29,223
Okay? Gumdrop.

1262
01:18:29,247 --> 01:18:32,542
Don't call me that.
I am nothing to you.

1263
01:18:34,586 --> 01:18:37,297
Just the person who's
carrying your baby.

1264
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,569
Oh, shit.

1265
01:18:41,593 --> 01:18:44,195
I'm going to throw up.

1266
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:46,532
Dawn Marie was
just joking, Gumdrop.

1267
01:18:46,556 --> 01:18:47,848
She can have him.

1268
01:19:37,357 --> 01:19:39,834
You don't take a hint.

1269
01:19:39,858 --> 01:19:41,836
I need to talk to Genevieve.

1270
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,714
She's got absolutely
nothing to say to you.

1271
01:19:43,738 --> 01:19:46,257
I need to talk to her.

1272
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:48,009
Look, I didn't cheat.

1273
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:49,803
Kissing some bimbo
in a public bar

1274
01:19:49,827 --> 01:19:51,389
while your girlfriend
frets at home

1275
01:19:51,413 --> 01:19:52,598
waiting to tell you that she's
having your baby

1276
01:19:52,622 --> 01:19:54,433
may not seem like
cheating to you,

1277
01:19:54,457 --> 01:19:57,687
but to the rest of the world,
I assure you, it is cheating.

1278
01:19:57,711 --> 01:20:00,314
- Whoa. Look, lady.
- Amber.

1279
01:20:00,338 --> 01:20:01,482
- Amber.
- Yeah.

1280
01:20:01,506 --> 01:20:02,816
The best friend.

1281
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,610
I need to talk to her.

1282
01:20:04,634 --> 01:20:06,654
I'm afraid that's not going
to happen any time soon.

1283
01:20:06,678 --> 01:20:08,279
Vivy needs some time.

1284
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:09,573
I suggest you give her that.

1285
01:20:09,597 --> 01:20:11,282
Just please.

1286
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:14,828
Please, just tell her that
I stopped by and to call me.

1287
01:20:14,852 --> 01:20:16,871
Please.

1288
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:17,938
Maybe.

1289
01:21:09,031 --> 01:21:10,593
She's not talking to you.

1290
01:21:10,617 --> 01:21:11,843
I need to talk to your sister.

1291
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:13,429
Why?
To make her cry some more.

1292
01:21:13,453 --> 01:21:16,640
That's all
she does is cry and vomit.

1293
01:21:16,664 --> 01:21:18,642
You broke her heart.

1294
01:21:18,666 --> 01:21:20,226
And usually when a guy
breaks the girl's heart,

1295
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:22,813
it's because he cheated on her.
So did you?

1296
01:21:22,837 --> 01:21:24,648
It wasn't like that.

1297
01:21:24,672 --> 01:21:26,484
I used to think
you were the best thing

1298
01:21:26,508 --> 01:21:28,109
that ever happened to me.

1299
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:29,695
The great Trent Fox.

1300
01:21:29,719 --> 01:21:32,322
Now you're just a prick
that ruined my sister.

1301
01:21:32,346 --> 01:21:33,616
Leave us alone.

1302
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:37,453
Better yet, take him.
I want anything

1303
01:21:37,477 --> 01:21:41,247
from someone who hurt my
sister to get into her pants.

1304
01:21:41,271 --> 01:21:43,899
Hope the next girl you bang
gives you an STD.

1305
01:23:24,709 --> 01:23:26,043
Rowan!

1306
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:29,565
Rowan!

1307
01:23:29,589 --> 01:23:30,649
Oh my God.

1308
01:23:30,673 --> 01:23:33,801
Babe? Babe? Babe?

1309
01:23:34,928 --> 01:23:35,946
What did you do?

1310
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:38,866
Nothing. I found her like this.

1311
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:41,492
My God, she's really sick.

1312
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:42,870
She's burning up.

1313
01:23:42,894 --> 01:23:44,454
Okay. Watch your sister.

1314
01:23:44,478 --> 01:23:46,080
I'm going to take her
to the emergency room.

1315
01:23:46,104 --> 01:23:47,875
She's not dressed.

1316
01:23:47,899 --> 01:23:49,710
Grab the blanket right there.
Hurry.

1317
01:23:49,734 --> 01:23:51,879
Come on, baby.
Call my mom.

1318
01:23:51,903 --> 01:23:53,589
Get her to come here
and watch Mary.

1319
01:23:53,613 --> 01:23:55,865
I'm taking her
to Summit Medical.

1320
01:24:06,668 --> 01:24:10,271
Okay. Okay. I'll say
it one more time.

1321
01:24:10,295 --> 01:24:13,817
I did not cheat.

1322
01:24:13,841 --> 01:24:15,903
That broad is a groupie.

1323
01:24:15,927 --> 01:24:18,656
All right, look, I was drunk.

1324
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:21,700
- She was all over me.
- Convenient excuse.

1325
01:24:21,724 --> 01:24:24,160
Amber, I would never
cheat on Genevieve.

1326
01:24:24,184 --> 01:24:25,913
You say that now.

1327
01:24:25,937 --> 01:24:26,956
But what about when she gets
all big with her pregnancy?

1328
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:28,289
More of her to love.

1329
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:29,833
What about
when you're on the road?

1330
01:24:29,857 --> 01:24:32,543
I don't know, I'll
hang out with the wags.

1331
01:24:32,567 --> 01:24:34,838
- The wags?
- Guys with wives

1332
01:24:34,862 --> 01:24:35,923
and girlfriends,.

1333
01:24:35,947 --> 01:24:38,676
And if she'll have me back

1334
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:42,220
I'll stay
far away from any groupies.

1335
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:43,973
Does anyone want to hear
what I think?

1336
01:24:43,997 --> 01:24:46,266
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1337
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:48,602
You had me so scared.

1338
01:24:48,626 --> 01:24:49,812
What happened?

1339
01:24:49,836 --> 01:24:51,981
You were dehydrated.

1340
01:24:52,005 --> 01:24:53,231
The baby's fine.

1341
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:55,525
The heartbeat's still strong.

1342
01:24:55,549 --> 01:24:58,152
Oh, Gumdrop.

1343
01:24:58,176 --> 01:25:00,071
Thank you for being here, Amber.

1344
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:03,157
There's no place I'd rather be.

1345
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:06,036
Can you give Trent
and I a few minutes?

1346
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:07,705
You're right outside
if you need me to come in,

1347
01:25:07,729 --> 01:25:08,938
kick some butt.

1348
01:25:10,023 --> 01:25:11,356
I think we'll be fine.

1349
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:20,133
Please, Genevieve,
I will do anything

1350
01:25:20,157 --> 01:25:22,761
to make this right.

1351
01:25:22,785 --> 01:25:24,595
I love you.

1352
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:28,182
I love this baby.

1353
01:25:28,206 --> 01:25:30,601
I want to build
our life together.

1354
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:33,921
You, me.
The baby, Rowan and Mary.

1355
01:25:40,635 --> 01:25:41,905
I believe you.

1356
01:25:41,929 --> 01:25:43,180
Yeah?

1357
01:25:44,724 --> 01:25:47,368
And, um...

1358
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,412
And?

1359
01:25:49,436 --> 01:25:50,688
I love you, too.

1360
01:25:53,357 --> 01:25:54,358
Oh, thank God.

1361
01:25:57,611 --> 01:26:00,381
Come here.

1362
01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:02,801
Oh, careful.
Are you okay?

1363
01:26:02,825 --> 01:26:04,159
I'm coming in.

1364
01:26:14,503 --> 01:26:15,981
Ports in Vegas this weekend.

1365
01:26:16,005 --> 01:26:18,108
What a season
Trent Fox is having.

1366
01:26:18,132 --> 01:26:20,193
Well, I'm a Trent Fox
believer now.

1367
01:26:20,217 --> 01:26:22,278
Should have tore his
hamstring years ago.

1368
01:26:22,302 --> 01:26:24,405
Are you guys having
fun in Vegas?

1369
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:26,366
Vivy, you have no idea.

1370
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:27,785
Tomorrow I'm going to go work
out with the team

1371
01:26:27,809 --> 01:26:30,203
and Trent got me a jersey
for every game

1372
01:26:30,227 --> 01:26:31,997
that they played a match.

1373
01:26:32,021 --> 01:26:33,581
Did you thank Trent
for bringing you along?

1374
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:36,626
More times than I can count.

1375
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:37,961
He's more excited about the
trips coming up

1376
01:26:37,985 --> 01:26:41,090
later this summer, huh?

1377
01:26:41,114 --> 01:26:42,132
Why don't you go hit the pool?

1378
01:26:42,156 --> 01:26:43,466
I'll talk to your sister.

1379
01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:44,968
Sure.

1380
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:46,552
There's some serious
babes here in Vegas.

1381
01:26:46,576 --> 01:26:48,722
- Behave.
- Always.

1382
01:26:48,746 --> 01:26:51,182
Hey, love you, Vivy.

1383
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:53,309
Get on out of here.
Have fun.

1384
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:56,187
Sorry. Just with Ross
nailing down my new contract.

1385
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:57,188
But how about you?

1386
01:26:57,212 --> 01:26:59,714
You know what I want to see.

1387
01:27:01,299 --> 01:27:03,277
Do I have to?

1388
01:27:03,301 --> 01:27:05,196
Come on.

1389
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:08,117
I mean, it's been a whole day.

1390
01:27:08,141 --> 01:27:09,142
Fine.

1391
01:27:13,562 --> 01:27:15,230
God. You are stunning, baby.

1392
01:27:17,859 --> 01:27:19,878
You say that every day.

1393
01:27:19,902 --> 01:27:22,131
How about this?

1394
01:27:22,155 --> 01:27:23,841
Marry me.

1395
01:27:23,865 --> 01:27:26,592
Same as yesterday.
Any time.

1396
01:27:26,616 --> 01:27:28,428
Time for what?

1397
01:27:28,452 --> 01:27:30,139
I just don't want it to be
about me being knocked up.

1398
01:27:30,163 --> 01:27:31,722
Okay?

1399
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:37,603
Let's just talk about it
after he's born.

1400
01:27:37,627 --> 01:27:40,023
Is it he?

1401
01:27:40,047 --> 01:27:42,067
Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.

1402
01:27:42,091 --> 01:27:45,904
I got the ultrasound yesterday
and I asked the technician

1403
01:27:45,928 --> 01:27:48,406
what it was between his
legs, and she laughed.

1404
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:51,076
And I'm so sorry.

1405
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:53,494
I ruined the surprise.
Are you mad?

1406
01:27:53,518 --> 01:27:56,747
Am I mad that I'm having a son?

1407
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:58,024
No, I'm fucking stoked.

1408
01:28:00,943 --> 01:28:02,796
Are you still seeing that
root chakra red

1409
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:05,924
when you meditate
like I taught to you?

1410
01:28:05,948 --> 01:28:07,324
Absolutely.

1411
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:11,054
Genevieve.

1412
01:28:11,078 --> 01:28:12,806
From here on out.

1413
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:15,290
When I'm with you, I'm home.

1414
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:24,967
I am going to go.
Okay? Bye.

1415
01:28:26,676 --> 01:28:27,719
Bye.
