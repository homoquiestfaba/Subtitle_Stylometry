1
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,144
Look what I caught.

2
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:57,248
Raymond, don't put that in my...

3
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,315
...sink.

4
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:00,949
Thought we could eat it.

5
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,081
What is it?

6
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,917
Catfish. I caught it in the lake.

7
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:09,584
Set up the boat.
Thought it'd be good for David.

8
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,821
You know, fresh air.

9
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:14,659
- Honey, he's really sick.
- It's a couple of hours.

10
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,496
Catch some fish,
eat some gumbo...

11
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,998
- Well, how clean is that lake?
- It's as clean as the ocean.

12
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,985
Eve...

13
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,654
...he's not up there.

14
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,065
Well, he didn't come down.

15
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,832
Check around the house.
I'll check outside.

16
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,589
David!

17
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,927
Hey, David!

18
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,264
David!

19
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,464
David!

20
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,070
David!

21
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,311
David!

22
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,814
David! David!

23
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,122
David!

24
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,186
David!

25
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,561
<i>David!</i>

26
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,705
David!

27
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:38,900
David! David!

28
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,080
I found something.

29
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,082
Get out of the way.
Get out of the way!

30
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,391
Do you recognize this?

31
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:56,289
- This is my son's.
- Where's my son?

32
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,227
- Where's my son? Where's my son?
- Raymond!

33
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,957
David! David!

34
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:05,036
David! David! David!

35
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,729
Please find my son.
Please find him.

36
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,464
- Where's my son?
- Hey, hey, hold it.

37
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:13,077
- Where's my son?
- No. God, no...

38
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:17,777
David! Where's my son?
Where's my son?

39
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,884
My son!

40
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:24,614
Where's my son? David!

41
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,707
I wanna visit Mom and Dad today.

42
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,771
We can't, it's too far.

43
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,144
Ben said he'd take me.

44
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,185
Look, Ethan, everyone talks nice
at funerals, okay?

45
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,515
Hey, you two.

46
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:03,358
- We're almost done.
- Can we go to the cemetery after?

47
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,126
Of course.

48
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,228
You all right?

49
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,236
Are you gonna be our new dad?

50
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,733
No.

51
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,074
Look...

52
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,248
...your parents would want you
to have a reaI mommy and daddy.

53
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:29,744
Just because I love you, doesn't mean
I'd be a good parent.

54
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,624
I'm a cop.

55
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,358
A good day for me means
coming home in one piece...

56
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,428
...to a studio apartment
and having chicken fingers.

57
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,030
Ethan?

58
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,358
Ethan, honey, come with me.
I have some people for you to meet.

59
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,133
It's okay. Go.

60
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,874
Go.

61
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,639
It's okay.

62
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,577
Come on.

63
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,755
It's okay. Come here.

64
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,238
I'm not leaving you, Abby.

65
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:31,312
I'll be there for you whenever
you need me. Always. I promise.

66
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:34,109
We need you now, Ben.

67
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,111
Excuse me, Mr. Koch, I need you
to sign some documents...

68
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,791
...so we can finalize this paperwork.

69
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,057
So how long have you known
the children?

70
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,492
Their whole life.
I've known their parents-

71
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,226
I knew their parents
since high schooI.

72
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:27,903
Oh, that must be a terrible loss
for you too, then. Thanks, CaroI.

73
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,068
Yeah.

74
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,674
Losing your friends beats what I'm
feeling right now, I'll tell you that.

75
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,212
Well, you're doing the right thing.

76
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,080
- Am I?
- Yeah. Sign on the second page.

77
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:54,964
Thanks.

78
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:44,576
Excuse me...

79
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,119
...can you keep a secret?

80
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,617
- What?
- A secret.

81
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,854
- Yeah.
- Okay.

82
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,429
- Here.
- Thank you.

83
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,667
You're welcome.

84
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,368
Are you, like, the hall monitor
or something?

85
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,640
No, I'm a mother.

86
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:19,207
And my secret is that I know
that everyone in this place...

87
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,181
...is just as scared as you are.

88
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:26,515
And I know that because
I've been on both sides.

89
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:28,993
Really?

90
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,194
But you know what?

91
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,858
I learned a lot about families.

92
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,592
And I learned you have to
protect your children.

93
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:40,928
And that you have to be
a good mother.

94
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,209
- Can we get we get some ice cream?
- Sure we can, buddy.

95
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:49,510
Hi. I'm Raymond.
You must be Ethan's sister.

96
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:52,445
- Yeah. Abby.
- Hi.

97
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:56,052
Are-? Are you taking him?

98
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,391
We lost our boy.

99
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:06,759
The truth is, I'm just not ready
to stop being a mother.

100
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:09,962
He's really lucky.

101
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:19,006
Now, be a big boy, Ethan.
And be really good, okay?

102
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:21,179
Everything's gonna be okay.

103
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:29,548
Don't worry. We're still gonna
see each other. All the time, okay?

104
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,852
You know another thing
that I learned about families:

105
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,090
It's that when you have
a five-bedroom home...

106
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,825
...you should definitely have
more than one child.

107
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,076
Here we are.

108
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,309
This is the foyer.

109
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,145
This is the formaI living room.

110
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:12,984
Come on, Abby.

111
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:17,762
See this? This is an atrium.
Raymond designed that.

112
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,331
No, Ethan, don't touch!

113
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:29,269
It's all right. It's all right.
This is your home too.

114
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,239
Come on. This is the staircase.
It goes up to the bedrooms.

115
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:35,538
I'll show you that in a minute.
This is the dining room.

116
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,706
And this is the den.

117
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,386
Raymond, wanna show him
what you bought him?

118
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:45,785
Oh, yeah. Ethan, buddy.
Look straight ahead.

119
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,824
- Yes!
- We'll never see him again.

120
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:52,989
- I love this game.
- Okay, here we go.

121
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,863
Now, up here we have
the bedrooms.

122
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:07,603
This is our room. I expect
breakfast in bed every Mother's Day.

123
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:12,750
Now, this- I think we can make this
a playroom. What do you think?

124
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,750
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay.

125
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:20,688
- Ethan, this is your room.
- Oh, this is so cooI.

126
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:25,655
- You like it?
- I think he likes it.

127
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:29,489
Now, I unpacked your things.
I put them where they should be, okay.

128
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,459
- Bathroom's right there.
- Okay.

129
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,228
All right.

130
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,902
We put Ethan close to us.

131
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:40,204
Why don't I show Abby the tower?
Your room. Come on.

132
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,344
You're gonna love it.

133
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,518
Word of warning:
Eve is a light sleeper.

134
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,486
- No backflips or cartwheels, okay?
- Right.

135
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,487
Here we are.

136
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,290
I'm up here alone?

137
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,560
You're an adult now. Time for you
to have your own space.

138
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,100
- You like it?
- Yeah.

139
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,367
You have the best view
in the whole house.

140
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:15,274
Look out this window. You and Ethan
are gonna be so happy here.

141
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,957
- What's in there?
- Don't go in there.

142
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:34,324
That's was our son's room.
Do not go in there.

143
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,629
Of course not.

144
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,869
There he is. Why don't you two
get your rooms in order...

145
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,736
...and I will meet you downstairs.
We'll eat in an hour.

146
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,241
Okay.

147
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,112
I saw a lake when we drove up.

148
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,343
Come.

149
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,877
Be carefuI.

150
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:33,550
- Let's go swimming.
- No, no. Stay right where you are.

151
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,529
What are you two doing?

152
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,666
Your mother's been worried sick.
Come on.

153
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,635
Ethan, come on.

154
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,234
Come on, buddy, let's go.

155
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:57,879
Abby, you coming?

156
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:07,318
Never, never go down to the lake
without us again.

157
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:12,989
Sorry.

158
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,358
Sorry.

159
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,237
You must tell me before you leave.

160
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:23,730
I don't know how it was before, but
you cannot run around by yourselves.

161
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:26,433
You have no idea
how dangerous it is here.

162
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,043
Besides, it's dinnertime.

163
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,616
Raymond, is the grill ready?

164
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,550
Yeah.

165
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,314
Thank you.

166
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:43,253
Hungry?

167
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,925
Come on.

168
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:34,136
Yes, I'm checking now.
It's okay, Abby. Go back to bed.

169
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,524
There's someone outside.

170
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,055
Look, I called it in, Abby.
They're gonna make a drive-by.

171
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,528
I just saw someone outside!

172
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:58,965
I heard you, and it's
gonna be okay. All right?

173
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,363
Abby, look, don't worry about it.

174
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:04,041
Abby.

175
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:05,938
Listen to me.

176
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:10,206
- Abby!
- Ethan. Are you okay?

177
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:13,408
He's scared.

178
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:18,321
This is why we stay
close to the house, okay?

179
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,716
Abby said she saw
someone outside.

180
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,886
It's the middle of the night.
Where were you?

181
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:31,997
Do you want to sleep
with Mommy tonight?

182
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,365
It's fine. I'll stay with him.

183
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,235
I want Abby.

184
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:46,417
Okay. You're both safe now.

185
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,420
Here, baby.

186
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,353
There she is. Have a seat.

187
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,057
How many pancakes do you want?

188
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,460
- Two's fine.
- Okay.

189
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,638
<i>- Raymond, breakfast.
- I'll be right down.</i>

190
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:47,036
He is in his office
at 6 every morning.

191
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:51,239
- I hope he doesn't wake you.
- Oh, no. I didn't hear him, it's fine.

192
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,614
I need some help around
the house today. Can I get...

193
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,413
...two volunteers?

194
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,924
Ethan, you...
You'll help Eve with the laundry, okay?

195
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,160
And I'll show you both how.

196
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,674
All right. Look, Ethan.

197
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,844
At the laundry. Okay.

198
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,876
What you wanna
make sure is...

199
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,077
Excuse me, Abby.
That's my father's gun.

200
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,652
His keepsake from the war.

201
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:32,085
Eve thinks I got rid of it, so:

202
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:35,989
All right, Ethan. You open it up, right?
Okay? See this?

203
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:38,287
And then what you wanna do
is you set the dials.

204
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,021
- Press?
- Okay. Yes.

205
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,757
Well, no, actually this one.
See, that one.

206
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:47,405
That's what you're gonna have to
ask your sister. Abby?

207
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,602
I'd like to say this only once.

208
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:56,140
Great. Okay. So then you have to
get detergent, which is up here.

209
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:59,145
All right. Down the stairs
all the way to the top...

210
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,376
...through that door is the attic.

211
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,348
A lot of work to do.

212
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:18,960
After you.

213
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,345
So, what do you think,
is it hot in here?

214
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:32,644
No.

215
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,446
- Not really.
- Well, this should be...

216
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,088
...the hottest room in the house.
Especially in summer.

217
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,850
That means all the hot air
is escaping.

218
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,218
- Isn't that a good thing?
- Well, no. Not in the winter.

219
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:47,762
I boarded this with new insulation
and you can help me with the rest.

220
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:51,330
Okay? Lose this window,
we'll make it airtight.

221
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,731
What do you think?
We'll do a little each day.

222
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:56,066
Be a nice way for us to
get to know each other.

223
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:57,571
- Okay.
- Good. Tell you what.

224
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:01,007
You... You can wear my tooI belt.

225
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:06,545
Leave it. It's okay.
I got plenty of those.

226
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,686
- Okay.
- Can you handle it?

227
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,281
Good.

228
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:31,973
<i>David.</i>

229
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,938
Why are you here?
You are never to come in here.

230
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,132
You promised, Abby.

231
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,541
Sorry.

232
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:45,873
Can you keep a secret?

233
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:48,710
- Yes.
- You sure?

234
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,182
Yeah.

235
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,520
Don't tell Eve.

236
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,254
Really, don't.

237
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,296
- Okay.
- Good.

238
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,365
Come on, now get out of here
before Eve finds you.

239
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,753
Abby, where are you going?

240
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,090
Walk.

241
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:37,996
It's lunchtime.

242
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,763
Oh, no, it's fine. I'll have
mine when I get back.

243
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:42,902
I don't want you wandering outside.

244
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,939
I'm not wandering,
I'm going to the lake.

245
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,135
No. Absolutely not.

246
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:50,211
Why not?

247
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,913
Because this is my house,
and these are my rules...

248
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:57,247
...and it's for your own good.
Do I have to spell it out?

249
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:00,117
- What is the problem?
- How about no lunch...

250
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:03,089
...and no walk.
Now go to your room!

251
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,296
Okay.

252
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,635
Sorry.

253
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:04,446
Abby, can you get the door please?

254
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,428
There's no one at the door.
There's never anyone at the door.

255
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:29,510
- Hey.
- Oh, my God, hi!

256
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,181
<i>How are you?</i>

257
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:33,978
<i>Hey, buddy.</i>

258
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:35,812
Hey.

259
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,017
<i>Eve was right.
You two are stir-crazy.</i>

260
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:45,219
She should know.

261
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,560
Well, it's a nice big house.

262
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,869
<i>Great view.</i>

263
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:55,733
There's a game room
with a PlayStation.

264
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,000
See, it doesn't get any
better than that, does it?

265
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:02,144
Hey.

266
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,013
What's going on with you?

267
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:08,079
Get us out of here.

268
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:12,118
<i>She is so weird.
It's like they have all this land...</i>

269
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:15,724
...and we're not allowed to leave
the house. There's a gross mattress...

270
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:17,758
...in the basement.
We can't use the phone.

271
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:19,930
<i>We need a dial-out code
to make a phone call.</i>

272
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:24,534
Abby. Look, you gotta
try to make this work.

273
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:27,603
I don't know if
Eve or Raymond told you this...

274
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:31,139
...but you know they lost their
little boy, their son, David, right?

275
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:34,834
- Yeah.
- He drowned. Down at the lake.

276
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,609
I tell you because
if you think they're mean...

277
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:41,877
...or if they don't
understand, believe me...

278
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:44,021
...they do understand.

279
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,825
Make it work for a few more weeks.

280
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,022
Because then, when I come back
to take you to Six Flags...

281
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,027
- Six Flags!
- ... I wanna see smiles...

282
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,961
...on both of your faces.

283
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,035
Hey.

284
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:38,301
Why is there a mattress
in the basement?

285
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:42,336
Why are you sneaking around
in the basement?

286
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,811
I'm not sneaking, it's just,
there's nowhere to go.

287
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:47,075
You guys don't even let us
out of the house.

288
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:50,520
Don't be silly,
we let you out of the house.

289
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:53,919
No, you don't.
You're always watching.

290
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,855
Well, is there something
you don't want us to see?

291
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:58,551
No.

292
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:01,755
We are responsible for you.
We protect you.

293
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,334
Ben protects us.

294
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,037
Ben Koch?

295
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,468
The man who lives downtown
in a one-bedroom apartment?

296
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,733
- That's who protects you?
- Yes.

297
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:13,342
He said we can stay with him.

298
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:17,713
- Ben doesn't want to be your parent.
- You don't know that.

299
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,452
Where is this attitude
coming from, young lady?

300
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,951
This is all for you.

301
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,885
For your safety. Your own parents
couldn't protect you.

302
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:33,553
Don't you dare talk about my parents.
You don't know my parents.

303
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,824
We are your parents.

304
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,831
Fuck you.

305
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:48,640
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

306
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,077
Now sit down!

307
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:04,259
- Honey, I think that-
- Raymond, don't.

308
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:15,095
It's okay, Ethan.
Eat your food.

309
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:17,035
It's okay.

310
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:35,889
House is locked tight.
Rug rats are asleep.

311
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,523
No, it's not right.

312
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:42,626
Not yet.

313
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:28,678
Hi, honey.

314
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,549
Raymond, are you gonna clean up?

315
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,275
- Why?
- She's gonna be here at 3:00.

316
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:39,079
Yes. I'll be ready.

317
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,815
- Morning, Abby.
- Hi.

318
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,758
Who's gonna be here at 3:00?

319
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,762
Caseworker.

320
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,264
And you missed breakfast.

321
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,535
It's 8:30.

322
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,053
You know, Abby...

323
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:13,815
...you might wanna
clean up a bit for the caseworker.

324
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:18,485
Put your hair back.
Put a cute sweater on. Like mine.

325
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,322
It's just nice to make an effort
when guests are coming, you know?

326
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:23,727
No offense.

327
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:28,167
<i>Actually, I'm not really into that
whole Stepford Wives look.</i>

328
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:30,865
No offense.

329
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,670
What's with the lockdown?
Are we under siege?

330
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:08,334
Around here we protect
our family, Abby.

331
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:12,942
You look cute.

332
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:29,332
What was wrong
with the other alarm?

333
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:33,368
Your mom bought an upgrade.
Double locks on all the doors.

334
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:35,900
She's not my mom.

335
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,045
- Hi.
- Hey.

336
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,011
May I speak to you
for a moment, please?

337
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,188
Right here is fine.

338
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,657
I don't know what outhouse
you were raised in...

339
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:03,099
...but don't ever say a nasty
remark about me again.

340
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,599
Otherwise, you're out of here.

341
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,368
And Ethan stays with us.

342
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:15,972
You're in my way, Eve.

343
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,445
I'm twice the bitch
you think you are.

344
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:35,761
It's just a standard checklist.
It shouldn't take too long.

345
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,800
But I do ask that you let
the children show me around.

346
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:40,630
Of course.

347
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:44,202
Okay, Abby and Ethan,
show me your rooms.

348
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,670
So, Ethan, you like your new home?

349
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:52,850
- Yeah.
- Yeah? All right.

350
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,668
Nice.

351
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:19,976
Lonely up here?

352
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,338
Anything you want
to talk to me about?

353
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,546
If we stay with this couple...

354
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:33,656
...and I leave to go to college...

355
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,587
...what happens to my brother?

356
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:39,354
Well, he could stay right here in
foster care and they could adopt him.

357
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:42,624
Adopt him?
What if I wanted to adopt him?

358
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:46,030
What if I wanted him to stay with me?
I have no say in that whatsoever?

359
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:49,297
You can be his legaI guardian
by the time you're 18.

360
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:53,576
And when I do turn 18...

361
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:56,907
...they can't do anything to stop me?

362
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,451
You have a claim to your little brother
for as long as you live.

363
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:05,921
And no one can take that
away from you.

364
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:08,382
Okay?

365
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:13,997
It's okay.

366
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,630
Any other sedatives?

367
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,434
No.

368
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:27,543
- Any codeine? Any Vicodin?
- No.

369
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:31,545
Don't most adults have some sort
of pain medication?

370
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,182
But you know children.

371
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:37,184
They explore. They're curious and we
don't want their curiosity to kill them.

372
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:41,688
So just be carefuI with what kind of
medication you have in the home.

373
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:43,486
Of course.

374
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:49,660
Okay. Take care, now.

375
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:51,698
- It was our pleasure.
- Thanks for coming.

376
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:54,496
- Have a safe trip back to the city.
- All right. Bye.

377
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:56,696
Let me get that.

378
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:02,035
Aren't you gonna
check the basement?

379
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:07,114
Well, should I check the basement?

380
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,651
David would play alone down here.

381
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:14,416
We've learned to keep
a better eye on our kids.

382
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:18,225
It was right here.
There used to be a bed right here.

383
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,294
- He slept here. There used to-
- Honestly.

384
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:22,932
- You think there was a bed here?
- Why do you think that?

385
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,728
I don't know,
I just know it was right here.

386
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,696
Well, there were some old blankets.

387
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:30,965
I threw them away.

388
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,510
What has gotten into you?

389
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,611
You know,
she said this to us last night.

390
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,303
Just...

391
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,540
Is this about
our conversation upstairs?

392
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,617
- No.
- About your brother?

393
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:46,846
No! No, that's not it at all.
There was a bed right here.

394
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:49,288
Okay, enough. Let's go upstairs.

395
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,824
I'm so sorry.

396
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,357
Abby, come on.

397
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,330
Come on.

398
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,168
- Drive safe. Bye.
- Okay. Bye-bye.

399
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:56,003
I made your favorite.

400
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,752
What about the kids' dinner?

401
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,390
Isn't this perfect?

402
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,702
Eve?

403
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:22,338
Honey?

404
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:25,732
Honey, talk to me.

405
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,875
It'll be different this time, I promise.

406
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:41,491
Chicken.

407
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:44,252
Peas. Salad.

408
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:46,328
Wine.

409
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,026
Perfect.

410
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:57,239
Drink your wine, Raymond.

411
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:55,016
Sit up.

412
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:14,536
You have chores.

413
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:17,646
Afterwards, maybe you can go
with your mother to run some errands.

414
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:19,577
Get you out of the house.

415
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:24,247
Raymond.

416
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:29,052
I'm sorry.

417
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:32,685
No worries.

418
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,727
I'll be in the office.

419
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:50,741
Hi there.

420
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:52,847
Raymond said I have chores.

421
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,414
Sit down.

422
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:56,882
Relax. Take it easy.

423
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:02,082
Oh, would you mind finishing
the dishes I left in the sink?

424
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:05,324
- Okay.
- Great. Thank you.

425
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,786
- What'd you do?
- I don't know!

426
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:38,928
- Cut myself!
- Eve, Abby hurt herself.

427
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:41,654
Oh, God. It hurts really bad.

428
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:43,423
Oh, my God!

429
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,192
Don't move.

430
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,738
I want to go to the hospitaI.

431
00:46:57,948 --> 00:47:00,314
Eve was a nurse, Abby.

432
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:02,576
Oh, dear. Look at that.

433
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,954
It's okay, it's okay.

434
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:07,917
Can't be clumsy
when dealing with glass, Abby.

435
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:10,650
It was already broken, Eve.

436
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:14,090
What are you doing?

437
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:17,395
- Be still.
- I don't want that.

438
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:19,466
- It's okay.
- I really don't want it.

439
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,797
It's okay, Abby.

440
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:27,809
Now, you ever had stitches?

441
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:30,607
Hold still.

442
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,620
Oh, my God!

443
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,220
Raymond, hold her.

444
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:40,984
Oh, my God!

445
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:46,159
- This is what a mother does, Abby.
- My God!

446
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,898
She comforts her child.

447
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:54,964
Heals her when she's sick.

448
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:59,469
Corrects her when she's wrong.

449
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:04,073
Oh, my God.

450
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:05,908
She does it because she wants to.

451
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,410
Expecting nothing in return.

452
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:15,391
Oh, my God.

453
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:18,527
That's all I've ever wanted to be.

454
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,128
Oh, my God!

455
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,491
To be a good mother.

456
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:35,007
- What is that?
- This is for pain.

457
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,879
- I'm not in pain.
- You will be.

458
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:52,487
- But he promised.
- Your father is very busy.

459
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:54,782
He doesn't have time
to drive you to a cemetery.

460
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:57,153
- He's not my father.
- Ethan.

461
00:49:57,361 --> 00:49:58,828
He's not.

462
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:00,690
Don't, Ethan.

463
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:03,529
What are you doing
out of bed, Abby?

464
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:07,499
I don't feeI well.
What did you give me?

465
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:10,333
I can make you some eggs.

466
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:11,734
No.

467
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:13,307
Toast?

468
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,909
No.

469
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:17,142
You have to eat something.

470
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:24,179
Ben Koch called yesterday.
I told him about your condition.

471
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:26,550
Yesterday I was fine.

472
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:30,222
No, Abby, you've been
in bed for three days.

473
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:37,331
He said he'd stop by when he could.

474
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:50,810
Eat up, baby.

475
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:31,078
- Oh, my God, Ethan.
- Help me.

476
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:32,949
- Are you okay?
- I'm reaI sick.

477
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:35,954
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, doctor, thank you.

478
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:39,617
Yes, fluids. All right,
thank you very much.

479
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:43,826
So he said to just keep doing
what we're doing.

480
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:45,592
That dehydration is the danger.

481
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:47,565
Was it food poisoning?

482
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:50,740
I don't know, honey.
I mean, we all ate the same thing.

483
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:56,435
- I wanna use the phone.
- Why?

484
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:58,637
I wanna call Ben
and tell him about this.

485
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:03,146
- All right, I'll call him tomorrow.
- Why can't I call him?

486
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,188
Because it's 3:00
in the morning, Abby.

487
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:08,380
Eve will take care of it.

488
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,890
And I want you in your
own bed tonight, all right?

489
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:19,257
It's all right, baby, Mommy's here.

490
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,232
It's okay, Ethan.

491
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:22,632
I'm here.

492
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:57,358
You're not having any dinner, Abby?

493
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:04,371
Have some soup, sweetie.

494
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:29,563
I made it for Ethan.

495
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:14,236
Good morning, Ethan.

496
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:19,964
Lots of fluids. Doctor's orders.

497
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:24,878
This is warm tea.

498
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:28,911
It's easy on your tummy,
make you feeI better.

499
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:35,581
This is not food poisoning.

500
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,418
It's not?

501
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:41,153
No. It's obviously
something else.

502
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,033
Take him to the hospitaI.

503
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:47,030
I can do it all here.

504
00:56:48,805 --> 00:56:50,329
You said you were gonna call Ben.

505
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:58,772
I called Ben.
He's gonna come by later this week.

506
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:01,877
When did you talk to him?

507
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:08,247
About an hour ago.
While you were sleeping.

508
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:10,890
Well, call him again.

509
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:15,558
Mind your manners, Abby. The man
isn't at your beck and call, all right.

510
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:22,501
Here, sweetie.

511
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:26,874
I know my brother and I know
that something is wrong with him.

512
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:38,046
How are you feeling, sweetie?

513
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:41,349
Do you want me to make you
something to eat?

514
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:52,121
Oh, my God.

515
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:17,815
Raymond...

516
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:19,386
...help me.

517
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:20,749
Not now.

518
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:23,653
You warned me about your wife
when I went in your son's room.

519
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:26,829
My son?

520
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:33,494
Made herself sick
nursing that boy to health.

521
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:39,364
I've never been more proud of her
in my entire life.

522
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:42,441
Who is that?

523
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:46,478
That's David.

524
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:49,174
Our last foster child.

525
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:56,682
"Tyler"?

526
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,191
Oh, God.

527
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:24,932
Ethan. I've got the car keys.

528
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:28,008
Ethan? Ethan, we're leaving, okay?

529
01:02:28,211 --> 01:02:30,577
Okay. Come on.

530
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,042
It's okay.

531
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:34,574
There you go. Here's your jacket.

532
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:36,775
Put your arm through.

533
01:02:36,986 --> 01:02:38,180
Okay, sit up.

534
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:41,718
I'm sorry.

535
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:43,854
Okay...

536
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,493
Oh, God.

537
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:31,430
Shit.

538
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,538
I'll be right back, okay?

539
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:36,939
I'll be right back.

540
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:54,823
Come on, come on.

541
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,108
Okay.

542
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:45,641
Come on, come on, come on.

543
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:49,549
No!

544
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:53,682
Come on, start. Shit. Start.

545
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:03,827
Shit.

546
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:05,933
Oh, God.

547
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:08,560
I'm sorry.

548
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:10,534
Come on.

549
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,653
Come on.

550
01:05:40,836 --> 01:05:42,303
Oh, you're cold.

551
01:05:44,473 --> 01:05:46,668
I'll bring Ben back with me.
I promise, okay?

552
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:38,618
You forgot my keys.

553
01:06:43,232 --> 01:06:48,033
You children make it so hard.

554
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:52,469
I spend every waking minute...

555
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:55,200
...wiping your snotty fucking noses...

556
01:06:55,411 --> 01:06:59,575
...and still you are so ungratefuI!

557
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:03,441
And you can't even do what I ask.

558
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:06,950
- What did you do to Ethan?
- I love Ethan.

559
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:09,218
Did you love David too?

560
01:07:11,994 --> 01:07:14,189
Where were you taking my son?

561
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:16,895
Never go outside!

562
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:43,351
Bad girls get sent to their rooms.

563
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:57,238
Help me! Help!

564
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:01,604
Help me! Help me!

565
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:05,937
Help me!

566
01:08:22,698 --> 01:08:24,563
Are you ready to apologize?

567
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:28,997
Yes.

568
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,706
Okay.

569
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:35,907
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

570
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,410
I have no fucking idea.

571
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,401
If you don't eat...

572
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:43,277
...you'll never leave.

573
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:37,387
You're so sick, Ethan.

574
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:40,252
That's why
your first mommy left you.

575
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:42,754
It's okay.

576
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:52,133
It's gonna make you
feeI better, baby.

577
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:56,804
There you go.

578
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:03,174
Go to sleep, baby.

579
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:06,348
I'm never gonna leave you, Ethan.

580
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:13,688
Mommy's right here.

581
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:31,276
Mommy will never, never leave you.

582
01:13:23,932 --> 01:13:26,162
You make one sound
and I'll kill him.

583
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:42,816
- Hey.
- Hey. How's it going?

584
01:13:43,018 --> 01:13:46,579
It's great. It's a beautifuI day.

585
01:13:46,789 --> 01:13:48,518
Yeah.

586
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:52,523
- Anything I can do for you?
- Yeah, I'm here to get the kids.

587
01:13:53,629 --> 01:13:55,529
You do remember me?

588
01:13:55,731 --> 01:13:57,790
- Yeah. Ben.
- Yeah, yeah.

589
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,060
- Yeah, Ben Koch, right?
- Yeah.

590
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:03,636
Family friend, yeah.
I wish you would've called first.

591
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,637
I did. No one answered.

592
01:14:07,843 --> 01:14:10,243
We planned this.
I was gonna take them to Six Flags.

593
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:14,075
Oh, dear. You know,
Eve drove the kids downtown.

594
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:18,219
- Some children's art exhibit.
- She did?

595
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:22,647
Yeah, they won't be back
untiI this evening.

596
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:28,087
Well, I'll tell them you came by.
It's a shame.

597
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:32,097
Yeah. A shame. Okay.

598
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:35,327
Oh, hey, look,
I brought this for Ethan.

599
01:14:35,537 --> 01:14:38,267
- You mind if I put this in his room?
- No, I'll give it to him.

600
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:41,068
You know what? It's okay.
I'll give it to him myself.

601
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:45,136
- It's a great house you got here.
- Thanks.

602
01:14:45,347 --> 01:14:48,145
Mind if I take a look around?

603
01:14:50,252 --> 01:14:53,483
Of course. Come on in.

604
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,426
This is a fantastic place.

605
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:03,894
- You want something to drink?
- No, I'm fine.

606
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:07,760
So where's his room?

607
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:11,064
Upstairs. End of the hallway.

608
01:15:11,273 --> 01:15:12,968
All right.

609
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:33,628
- This one?
- No.

610
01:15:35,397 --> 01:15:37,365
That's it.

611
01:15:53,682 --> 01:15:55,547
Nice room.

612
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:57,742
Yeah, you know, it's all Eve.

613
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:02,314
I got a gift for Abby...

614
01:16:02,524 --> 01:16:05,186
...but, you know, I should probably
give it to her in person.

615
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,259
How's she doing?

616
01:16:07,462 --> 01:16:12,092
She's a handfuI. You know,
Eve calls her our summer project.

617
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:32,751
Well, I guess just tell the kids
we'll reschedule.

618
01:16:32,955 --> 01:16:34,786
That is strange, you know.

619
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:36,981
I thought they were
looking forward to it.

620
01:16:37,192 --> 01:16:40,628
- They change like the weather.
- Yeah.

621
01:16:58,847 --> 01:17:01,145
Thanks. Have a good day.

622
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:03,818
- You too.
- All right.

623
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:36,675
He's gone.

624
01:17:38,453 --> 01:17:39,647
Oh, my God.

625
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:53,665
I got you.

626
01:17:53,869 --> 01:17:56,269
I'm putting him back to bed.

627
01:18:28,503 --> 01:18:31,700
Ethan. Ethan.

628
01:18:36,578 --> 01:18:38,205
Oh, God.

629
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:43,009
<i>Ethan. Ethan, I'm gonna
get us out of here.</i>

630
01:18:44,352 --> 01:18:46,843
I'm gonna get some help, okay?

631
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:47,979
Abby!

632
01:20:10,005 --> 01:20:11,267
Hello.

633
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:13,065
Gotcha.

634
01:20:17,612 --> 01:20:19,170
Hello? Hello?

635
01:20:21,883 --> 01:20:26,047
<i>We're sorry. No outside calls can
be made without a dial-out code.</i>

636
01:20:29,224 --> 01:20:31,351
Yeah, this is Officer Ben Koch
of the L.A.P.D.

637
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,323
Yeah, I'm at 100 Pine Haven Lane.

638
01:20:33,528 --> 01:20:36,258
I'm proceeding inside
on suspicion of child endangerment.

639
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:41,331
<i>Abby.</i>

640
01:20:41,536 --> 01:20:42,867
I know you can hear me.

641
01:20:43,071 --> 01:20:44,470
<i>You're not going anywhere.</i>

642
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:02,551
Abby! I got you.

643
01:21:12,133 --> 01:21:13,691
You just can't leave.

644
01:21:46,968 --> 01:21:48,629
Worthless.

645
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:02,055
Ethan, honey, you stay right there.

646
01:25:03,331 --> 01:25:07,427
You're safe now, baby.
Mommy will be right back.

647
01:26:07,962 --> 01:26:11,090
I have had enough of you!

648
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:27,615
AII I ever wanted
was to be a good mother!

649
01:26:29,551 --> 01:26:30,677
But you're not good!

650
01:26:33,888 --> 01:26:37,221
And you're not my mother.

651
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:45,786
Ethan?

652
01:28:04,679 --> 01:28:06,408
Ethan.

653
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:14,755
Okay. Okay.

654
01:28:22,163 --> 01:28:24,154
Are you okay?

655
01:28:30,638 --> 01:28:31,764
Stop!

656
01:28:32,807 --> 01:28:35,708
You stay away from my son!

657
01:28:45,887 --> 01:28:47,821
Put the gun down, Raymond.

658
01:28:48,022 --> 01:28:49,751
Put it down.

659
01:29:05,306 --> 01:29:06,500
Ben?

660
01:29:06,708 --> 01:29:08,676
It's okay, Abby.

661
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:35,425
<i>Yeah.</i>
