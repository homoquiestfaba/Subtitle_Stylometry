1
00:02:59,292 --> 00:03:02,073
All systems a go,
waiting for your order, Sir.

2
00:03:02,362 --> 00:03:03,663
Thank you, Colonel.

3
00:03:18,751 --> 00:03:21,585
I got F-16's at 10 and two o’clock.

4
00:03:24,792 --> 00:03:29,834
<i>-Roger, that is a bogey. Let's get him.
-I'm right on your Wing, Boss.</i>

5
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:39,501
<i>-There he goes.
-I’m on him.</i>

6
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,250
<i>You hang back, I’ll take him.</i>

7
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:51,418
<i>Bogey in sight.
Closing to mark 0.7.</i>

8
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,334
<i>I’m coming up on his 6.</i>

9
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:12,750
Mel to Edwards, standby
to go active on my mark.

10
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:22,876
<i>Getting a ﬁx, target locking on.</i>

11
00:04:32,834 --> 00:04:34,124
<i>Got you.</i>

12
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,500
-Ratchets got a lock, sir.
-Told you, he’s the best.

13
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:42,584
Nova, engage active stealth on my mark.

14
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,710
3, 2, 1, mark.

15
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:05,625
Blue 2, I've lost contact with
our bandit. Do you have a positive?

16
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:08,708
<i>It’s gone.
Cheek your FLARE.</i>

17
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:12,208
<i>No sign of him on the HOZ,
the FLARE or the E-O, sir.</i>

18
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:15,583
<i>Target locator line is blank,
range to target negative.</i>

19
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:17,208
<i>Closure rate zero. Nothing.</i>

20
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:20,500
-What about visual contact?
<i>-Now you see him, now you don’t.</i>

21
00:05:20,626 --> 00:05:23,793
<i>He’s not on any of our displays
and I don’t see him out there.</i>

22
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:28,627
A plane can’t just disappear.

23
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,542
<i>Where the hell did he come From?</i>

24
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:46,959
Incredible.

25
00:06:04,417 --> 00:06:06,251
<i>Trying evasive maneuvers.</i>

26
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:12,918
<i>Weapons engaged.</i>

27
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:16,210
<i>I can’t shake him, shit!</i>

28
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:21,960
<i>Lock on.</i>

29
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:26,583
<i>Fire side missile.</i>

30
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:33,168
Blue 1, you’ve been tagged. Abort
your mission and return to base.

31
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,375
Shit.

32
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,375
<i>Let's rock and roll.</i>

33
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:00,084
<i>Going full throttle.</i>

34
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,001
<i>I can’t see him, I can’t see him.</i>

35
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,584
<i>Ratcher’s been tagged.</i>

36
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:26,459
Ratcher’s been tagged.

37
00:07:27,584 --> 00:07:32,001
Sorry, Tom. You are the best we’ve got
but nobody can beat Nova technology.

38
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:34,793
Go ahead and continue
on to rendezvous point Delta.

39
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:46,709
That’s a 95 percent PK,
Splash two F-16‘s.

40
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,668
Nice job, Nova.

41
00:07:50,834 --> 00:07:53,166
That’s an impressive piece
of hardware you’ve got there.

42
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:56,793
Thank you, sir.
Black Thunder returning to base.

43
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:03,584
Roger, Nova. Great job.

44
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:05,999
-Congratulation, Colonel.
-Thank you, sir.

45
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:10,583
Event Tom couldn’t get past the Nova.
We gave him a hell of a surprise.

46
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:12,460
Yes, sir, I’m sure we did.

47
00:08:31,876 --> 00:08:33,999
General Barnes...
Great Job...

48
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,124
-Thanks.
-Great job.

49
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,249
It's a milk run, sir.

50
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:39,375
I could have blasted those F-16‘s out
of the sky if you’d given me any word.

51
00:08:39,501 --> 00:08:44,375
I know you could have, I know. Well
tomorrow’s our last test exercise.

52
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:47,085
After that we go from
prototype to production.

53
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:49,209
You sending me to Baghdad, sir?

54
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:51,126
From your lips to God’s ears.

55
00:08:51,334 --> 00:08:54,751
Now, unfortunately I'm only
putting Nellis on full alert.

56
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,833
Everyone from General Sorenson to
the janitor will be looking for you.

57
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:00,293
You get in there, I’ll buy you dinner.

58
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:03,710
Sir, I can taste that lobster now.

59
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,751
I bet you can.

60
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,625
Edwards, we’ve got a problem.

61
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:16,124
Sir, Ratcher’s reporting a malfunction.

62
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,500
-Talk him through it, Captain.
-Blue 1, what’s your status, over?

63
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:22,918
Blue 1 to Edwards, do you copy?

64
00:09:25,751 --> 00:09:29,124
Flame out! We’ve lost
both rear engines.

65
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,041
Going down.
Base..base!

66
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:34,001
-Sir, he’s got a flame out.
-Tom, get the hell out of there.

67
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:40,793
He's losing altitude fast, Blue 1, eject.

68
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:51,833
Eject, eject.

69
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:54,585
<i>Can’t eject.
The G-force is too strong.</i>

70
00:09:58,042 --> 00:10:00,666
-We’ve lost all radar contact.
-Did he have time to eject?

71
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:02,710
-It doesn’t look good.
-Dammit.

72
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:06,459
OK, I’ll inform General Barnes.

73
00:10:14,501 --> 00:10:16,168
-Sir.
-Yes, Colonel.

74
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:19,458
-Colonel Ratcher’s plane went down.
-What?

75
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:22,500
-He crashed a few miles out.
-What the hell happened?

76
00:10:22,626 --> 00:10:25,874
Apparently a ﬂame out. Search and rescue’s
starting their investigation now.

77
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,083
-Did he get out?
-No, sir.

78
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:30,327
How the hell did this happen?

79
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:33,376
Torn Ratcher’s one of the
best pilot’s we’ve ever had.

80
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:03,874
-What do we have here?
-A surprise.

81
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,209
Very-nice.

82
00:11:17,406 --> 00:11:18,246
Awesome.

83
00:11:36,015 --> 00:11:37,156
No.

84
00:11:38,979 --> 00:11:41,646
-Who is it?
-Base camp.

85
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,000
They’re probably passed
I didn’t ﬁll out my reports.

86
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:51,904
Yes, sir.
Yeah, right away.

87
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,376
Hey, babe. Uh,

88
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,998
You’re not going to believe
this but I’ve got to go.

89
00:12:02,124 --> 00:12:03,499
You’re kidding.

90
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,917
Man, I wish I was.

91
00:12:06,874 --> 00:12:10,375
Can we do this tomorrow?

92
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:14,750
-Do I have a choice?
-Thanks.

93
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:17,667
Okay.

94
00:13:02,728 --> 00:13:03,853
Hey, Nick.

95
00:13:05,644 --> 00:13:06,853
How are you?

96
00:13:34,102 --> 00:13:35,269
Nick.

97
00:13:37,102 --> 00:13:38,727
-Morning.
-Morning.

98
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:40,270
You up for this today?

99
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,477
Yeah. Sure, as ready
as I’ll ever he.

100
00:13:42,603 --> 00:13:43,602
Good.

101
00:13:43,728 --> 00:13:46,643
Investigation team will want to talk
to you about Torn when you get back.

102
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:48,436
Sure, yeah, set it up.

103
00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:54,770
Gentlemen.

104
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:58,518
Today the Nova goes up against the best
air craft detection system in the world.

105
00:13:58,644 --> 00:14:00,393
A United States Air Force Base.

106
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:03,326
Sir, you really think the Nova
can get through Nellis’ radar

107
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:04,384
and patrol ﬁghter net?

108
00:14:04,475 --> 00:14:06,352
They’re locked down tight as a drum.

109
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,104
Not only will the Nova get through,

110
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:10,096
but Colonel Moore will
drop a dummy payload...

111
00:14:10,186 --> 00:14:12,520
right in the middle of runway one.

112
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:16,728
When he succeeds it will he the beginning
of a new era in stealth technology.

113
00:14:18,056 --> 00:14:19,060
Captain.

114
00:14:19,186 --> 00:14:22,186
Nova 1, you are now
cleared for take-off.

115
00:14:53,728 --> 00:14:58,226
Sir, last radar contact with the Nova
was here, that was 15 minutes ago.

116
00:14:58,352 --> 00:15:01,061
He should have reached
Nellis two minutes after that.

117
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,602
Now if he’s still cloaked
he’s in experimental territory.

118
00:15:04,728 --> 00:15:06,893
We’ve never been active that long before.

119
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:08,934
And Nellis has no conﬁrmation
of payload drop?

120
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,679
Alright, Captain,
let’s break radio silence.

121
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:14,311
Yes, Sir.
Nova, Edwards, <i>do you copy?</i>

122
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,686
Break radio silence and answer, Nova.

123
00:15:18,895 --> 00:15:20,018
Nova, do you copy?

124
00:15:20,144 --> 00:15:21,895
There is nothing, sir.

125
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:26,520
Alright, Colonel, have Nellis start a
search and rescue operation immediately.

126
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:29,602
-There is one other possibility, sir.
-Yes?

127
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:32,520
Colonel Moore went AWOL with the plane.

128
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:35,101
I hand picked the Colonel
for this project.

129
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:37,894
I ﬂew with his father in Vietnam,
goddamn it.

130
00:15:38,853 --> 00:15:41,103
This man would not steal my airplane.

131
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:48,143
Stone, this is Black Thunder.

132
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:50,478
<i>Black Thunder to Stone, do you copy?</i>

133
00:15:50,936 --> 00:15:54,602
-Ha, ha, ha. Go Black Thunder.
-The Nova is secure.

134
00:15:54,728 --> 00:15:56,769
Excellent, excellent.

135
00:15:56,895 --> 00:15:59,562
-Proceed to phase 2.
-Copy that.

136
00:16:04,811 --> 00:16:08,769
Sir, Colonel Moore went through
security check point this morning,

137
00:16:08,895 --> 00:16:12,393
Three sets of blue caps saw his ID
card, his thumb prints on the records.

138
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:15,560
And no one else had access to the
notebooks, including our other pilots?

139
00:16:15,686 --> 00:16:18,101
-Right.
-While there’s no way to get a radar ﬁx.

140
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,810
And Nellis has no reports
of wreckage in the area.

141
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:23,562
Dammit.
Come with me, Colonel.

142
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,706
There’s something kind of funny
about us losing a stealth plane.

143
00:16:29,811 --> 00:16:31,352
I’m not laughing, Colonel:

144
00:16:31,478 --> 00:16:33,934
What I mean, sir, is we build
an invisible War Plane and...

145
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,477
I knew what you mean.

146
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:38,101
Have CIO start a satellite
re-con immediately.

147
00:16:38,227 --> 00:16:40,727
And I want an SR71
fueled and ready to go.

148
00:16:40,853 --> 00:16:44,771
-Yes, Sir.
-And Colonel, get Vince Connors.

149
00:17:07,144 --> 00:17:08,394
OK, ready?

150
00:17:10,227 --> 00:17:12,226
What are the four forces of ﬂying?

151
00:17:12,352 --> 00:17:17,352
Uh, the four forces...
Thrust, Drag, Lift and Weight.

152
00:17:17,478 --> 00:17:19,810
You are very good, Winston.

153
00:17:19,936 --> 00:17:22,145
So, you gonna let me ﬂy the plane now?

154
00:17:23,227 --> 00:17:25,936
Like I said, you’ve got
to learn this stuff.

155
00:17:27,728 --> 00:17:30,851
The basics, like this guy here.
See this guy?

156
00:17:30,977 --> 00:17:33,728
Tom Ratcher, taught me everything I know.

157
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:35,728
He's the best pilot there is.

158
00:17:37,478 --> 00:17:40,728
-And you know what?
-He was your teacher.

159
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:44,396
You got it. You’re smart, you know what?
You know everything.

160
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,311
<i>Whiskey tango delta 71, do you copy?</i>

161
00:17:59,352 --> 00:18:01,644
This is Whiskey Tango Delta, copy.

162
00:18:01,936 --> 00:18:04,136
<i>Connors, you are to return
to the airﬁeld immediately</i>...

163
00:18:04,227 --> 00:18:08,769
<i>by order of General Barnes, USAF.
This is a national emergency.</i>

164
00:18:09,102 --> 00:18:10,603
Copy, heading back.

165
00:18:16,156 --> 00:18:18,698
I guess we’re going to have
to cut this day short.

166
00:18:30,561 --> 00:18:33,143
This is Edwards
Air Force Base, to Nova 1.

167
00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:35,978
You’ve been detected
by Eye In the Sky satellites.

168
00:18:36,144 --> 00:18:37,255
By the power and authority

169
00:18:37,346 --> 00:18:39,435
of the President of the
United States of America,

170
00:18:39,561 --> 00:18:42,561
you are hereby ordered
to land immediately.

171
00:18:57,811 --> 00:19:00,103
-Sorry, sir, we lost him again.
-Damn.

172
00:19:18,311 --> 00:19:20,727
-Sir, how are you?
-Vince, I'm not well.

173
00:19:20,853 --> 00:19:21,893
What’s the problem?

174
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:25,019
Vince, what I’m about to tell you does
not leave this building, understood?

175
00:19:25,186 --> 00:19:26,268
Yes, sir.

176
00:19:26,394 --> 00:19:28,966
Earlier today one of our
experimental aircraft, the Nova,

177
00:19:29,057 --> 00:19:30,681
was stolen from this base.

178
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:33,061
-Stolen?
-Stolen.

179
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:37,228
The Nova’s a black project, ultra top
secret. Code name Black Thunder.

180
00:19:37,603 --> 00:19:39,602
It incorporates standard
stealth technology...

181
00:19:39,728 --> 00:19:42,728
but it adds something new,
an active stealth system.

182
00:19:43,144 --> 00:19:45,144
Active?
What do you mean active?

183
00:19:45,311 --> 00:19:48,561
You’re familiar with the black box
ECM on the SR71?

184
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:50,893
Yes, the radar jammer.

185
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:52,018
Yes.

186
00:19:52,144 --> 00:19:54,976
We’ve had a team working on improvements
for the past thirty ﬁve years.

187
00:19:55,102 --> 00:19:58,393
What they’ve come up with
is active stealth. It's a cloaking device.

188
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:01,226
A cloaking device?
Like in Space Tech.

189
00:20:01,352 --> 00:20:02,518
Exactly.

190
00:20:02,644 --> 00:20:04,352
It uses an electromagnetic impulse.

191
00:20:04,478 --> 00:20:08,268
Which bend light to a wavelength
of under 3500 angstrom units

192
00:20:08,394 --> 00:20:10,769
Which renders the Nova
invisible to the human eye.

193
00:20:10,895 --> 00:20:14,143
Blanketed from radar,
positioning devices.

194
00:20:14,269 --> 00:20:15,727
Things of that nature.

195
00:20:15,853 --> 00:20:21,312
Vince. This is a completely
invisible airplane.

196
00:20:26,561 --> 00:20:28,143
Someone stole this, sir?

197
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:31,352
Yes. One of our best pilots.

198
00:20:31,728 --> 00:20:34,012
Took off about three hours ago
on a routine training mission.

199
00:20:34,102 --> 00:20:35,310
He hasn't returned.

200
00:20:35,436 --> 00:20:39,103
Search and Rescue found no indication,
no evidence of a crash site.

201
00:20:40,352 --> 00:20:43,103
Sir, what kind of range
does this plane have?

202
00:20:43,436 --> 00:20:47,226
I mean, can’t we just send in a
strike force when it stops to refuel?

203
00:20:47,352 --> 00:20:50,352
It’s equipped with the latest
fuel cell turbine technology.

204
00:20:50,478 --> 00:20:54,020
It can ﬂy over twenty thousand
kilometers without refueling.

205
00:20:54,977 --> 00:20:57,352
-That’s halfway around the world, sir.
-Vince.

206
00:20:57,561 --> 00:20:59,143
It’s the ultimate weapon, Vince.

207
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:02,269
Whoever has the Nova
can literally rule the world.

208
00:21:03,186 --> 00:21:06,352
Sir, if each of our bases uses
their AWAC’s planes to search...

209
00:21:06,478 --> 00:21:10,104
Only a handful of people know this plane
even exists. I want to keep it that way.

210
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,562
You’re the best pilot I’ve ever seen.

211
00:21:12,728 --> 00:21:14,978
Vince, I need you to get
that plane back for me.

212
00:21:17,102 --> 00:21:19,020
How am I supposed to do that?

213
00:21:19,603 --> 00:21:22,185
Active stealth is a drain
on the Nova’s power system.

214
00:21:22,311 --> 00:21:26,310
It's designed to only work with
strategic and evasive operations.

215
00:21:26,436 --> 00:21:30,187
So for most of the time it'll be under
the cover of standard stealth only.

216
00:21:30,686 --> 00:21:34,352
Now, our CIO spy satellite
spotted the Nova here,

217
00:21:34,478 --> 00:21:37,437
over the Bonan Islands, flying
on a heading of two six zero.

218
00:21:37,686 --> 00:21:40,226
The Nova is equipped with a DAX
satellite monitoring system,

219
00:21:40,352 --> 00:21:43,311
so naturally it went active stealth here.

220
00:21:43,603 --> 00:21:46,187
Probably moving
in a straight line to conserve fuel.

221
00:21:46,853 --> 00:21:49,270
Sir, this route’s going to
take him through China,

222
00:21:49,895 --> 00:21:51,937
India, Iran, Iraq...

223
00:21:53,728 --> 00:21:55,518
I don’t know, that’s a lot of ground.

224
00:21:55,644 --> 00:21:58,310
That's why I'm sending you up
in a modiﬁed SR7l.

225
00:21:58,436 --> 00:22:00,513
It’s equipped with the Phillips
Thermal Tracking System.

226
00:22:00,603 --> 00:22:03,603
Which can pick up the Nova’s heat
signature, but only at close range.

227
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:08,227
Sir, they found Colonel Moore’s
body in his apartment. Shot twice.

228
00:22:09,603 --> 00:22:10,685
Nick Moore?

229
00:22:10,811 --> 00:22:13,437
Yes. They cut off his thumb
to get by the print scanner.

230
00:22:13,603 --> 00:22:15,978
Well at least we know Nick
didn’t steal the plane?

231
00:22:16,811 --> 00:22:19,437
Well then who the hell did I put
in that cockpit this morning?

232
00:22:19,811 --> 00:22:22,270
Does the man have
an identical twin brother?

233
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:28,978
Vince, I need you to get me that
plane back. Minimum footprint.

234
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:30,561
Yes, Sir.

235
00:22:30,811 --> 00:22:32,936
You'll be working with
Captain Rick Jannick.

236
00:22:36,102 --> 00:22:37,185
Geez.

237
00:22:41,311 --> 00:22:43,561
-I’m not working with him.
-What?

238
00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:46,520
He’s not a pilot. Sir.

239
00:22:47,853 --> 00:22:50,645
He’s a skydiver,
he takes too many chances.

240
00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:53,061
With all due respect, sir,

241
00:22:53,603 --> 00:22:57,812
I’d rather work with Tom Ratcher.
He’s the best ACM pilot in the world.

242
00:22:58,352 --> 00:23:00,853
-He’s thought me more stuff than...
-Vince...

243
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,310
Tom is dead.

244
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:07,811
His plane went down
in that training exercise yesterday.

245
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:30,686
<i>This-E Black Thunder to Stone.
Preceding to rendezvous-point Alpha.</i>

246
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:33,437
This ought to be interesting.

247
00:23:35,686 --> 00:23:38,769
Vince, buddy, it's been along time.

248
00:23:41,773 --> 00:23:43,190
That was pleasant.

249
00:23:48,811 --> 00:23:51,603
Remember the Blackbird
interceptor project back in ‘65?

250
00:23:52,227 --> 00:23:54,727
Before my time, sir, but I know of it.

251
00:23:54,853 --> 00:23:58,103
-New plane, Same weapons.
-Weapons? Great.

252
00:23:58,686 --> 00:24:00,602
Let’s just hope we don't
have Tu use them, huh?

253
00:24:00,728 --> 00:24:03,560
I don’t know about you.
But I'm ready to rock and roll.

254
00:24:03,686 --> 00:24:07,061
These scumbags took our plane.
Let's waste them.

255
00:24:08,352 --> 00:24:11,310
We'll get the Nova back without
any international incident, sir.

256
00:24:11,436 --> 00:24:12,436
Good.

257
00:24:12,644 --> 00:24:14,124
I don't want to sound overly dramatic

258
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:16,096
but I don't need to tell
you how important this is.

259
00:24:16,186 --> 00:24:17,520
No, Sir.

260
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:23,310
-Good luck.
-Thank you, Sir.

261
00:24:23,853 --> 00:24:24,853
Thank you.

262
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:42,394
<i>Okay, Connors, Jannick.
She’s prepped and ready to go.</i>

263
00:26:57,019 --> 00:26:59,019
It’s just like old times, Vince.

264
00:26:59,644 --> 00:27:04,520
Oxygen pressure, good. Oil pressure, good.
And the fuel is ﬂowing.

265
00:27:05,019 --> 00:27:06,645
We are set to go.

266
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:11,310
Okay, Tower, in position.
<i>Ready for take off.</i>

267
00:27:11,436 --> 00:27:13,395
Roger. All systems go.

268
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:52,101
General Barnes. Connors and Jannick
are airborne in the SR71, sir.

269
00:27:52,227 --> 00:27:54,477
-Radio frequency is open.
-Alright. Captain.

270
00:27:56,769 --> 00:27:58,435
Let’s ﬁnd this thing and blast it.

271
00:27:58,561 --> 00:28:01,395
I got dinner plans tonight
if you know what I mean.

272
00:28:01,686 --> 00:28:05,560
Orders are to get it back in one piece.
Minimum footprint.

273
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:07,520
Jannick, let me be honest with you.

274
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,686
You the last person I would have
picked to back me up.

275
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:13,728
You're not a pilot, you're a skydiver.

276
00:28:14,394 --> 00:28:16,603
You bail at the ﬁrst sign of trouble.

277
00:28:16,977 --> 00:28:18,518
Ancient history, My man.

278
00:28:18,644 --> 00:28:20,811
I got a lot of air under my wings
since then.

279
00:28:20,977 --> 00:28:24,435
Yeah? Well just remember
my life’s in your hands.

280
00:28:24,561 --> 00:28:26,353
And mine in yours, partner.

281
00:29:11,144 --> 00:29:15,185
New toy here, my man.
Turn right going two ﬁve nine.

282
00:29:15,311 --> 00:29:18,520
Turning right going two ﬁve nine.

283
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:33,520
Bingo CIO imaging the Nova.

284
00:29:34,186 --> 00:29:35,186
Where?

285
00:29:35,352 --> 00:29:37,976
Stand by. Triangulating
Nova's position.

286
00:29:38,102 --> 00:29:40,352
Over the Thar Desert, in India.

287
00:29:41,227 --> 00:29:43,769
It will take five minutes
for the fuel cells to recharge.

288
00:29:43,895 --> 00:29:45,393
Right, Colonel.

289
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:47,437
Until then he can't go active.

290
00:29:48,436 --> 00:29:50,934
-Blackbird, Edwards.
<i>-This is Blackbird, go ahead.</i>

291
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,685
<i>Vince, we’ve get a ﬁx on the Nova.</i>

292
00:29:52,811 --> 00:29:57,228
<i>27 degrees, 31 minutes north,
by 69 degrees 27 minutes east...</i>

293
00:29:57,394 --> 00:30:00,312
<i>on a heading of
two four-ﬁve. Over.</i>

294
00:30:00,644 --> 00:30:02,769
Roger that.
We’re on our way.

295
00:30:08,603 --> 00:30:11,479
Here we go, may have something.
Going Infrared.

296
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:18,936
-Take her down for a visual.
-Descending to 45.

297
00:30:24,186 --> 00:30:27,436
We have a positive IR signature
on the Nova Stealth Fighter.

298
00:30:28,644 --> 00:30:30,562
Moving in for visual contact.

299
00:30:41,352 --> 00:30:45,686
<i>This is US SR71 Blackbird,
please land your aircraft immediately.</i>

300
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:47,645
Got a lock.

301
00:30:49,853 --> 00:30:52,687
<i>Nova, please respond.
Please respond.</i>

302
00:30:58,478 --> 00:31:01,187
<i>If you do not respond,
we'll be forced to fire.</i>

303
00:31:04,769 --> 00:31:08,144
Jannick, common. Help me out here.
Where's the visual?

304
00:31:09,478 --> 00:31:12,020
It's hard to make a visual at Mag 2.
Where is he?

305
00:31:16,311 --> 00:31:18,394
<i>-He’s right behind us.</i>
-Hold on.

306
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,518
-He’s gone.
-Dammit.

307
00:31:46,644 --> 00:31:47,894
Where is he?

308
00:31:50,102 --> 00:31:52,769
-Base, Connors.
<i>-This is Edwards, go ahead.</i>

309
00:31:54,478 --> 00:31:56,895
We lost him.
He went active stealth.

310
00:31:58,728 --> 00:32:01,604
<i>Roger, Vince.
What's your status?</i>

311
00:32:02,102 --> 00:32:05,185
Sir, if you want us to continue
the search, we need to refuel.

312
00:32:05,311 --> 00:32:07,603
Vince, there is 135 in your quadrant.

313
00:32:07,769 --> 00:32:10,520
-Okay, I copy that.
-Okay, I have it.

314
00:32:10,936 --> 00:32:13,103
Turning left to point zero eight.

315
00:32:29,686 --> 00:32:33,061
<i>This is 135, we have a visual
contact with Blackbird.</i>

316
00:32:33,227 --> 00:32:35,602
<i>Moving in to begin refueling process.</i>

317
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:45,228
<i>135, you are locked in Blackbird.
Fueling Commencing.</i>

318
00:32:53,686 --> 00:32:57,895
<i>-Fueling complete.</i>
-Copy. Disengaging.

319
00:33:01,561 --> 00:33:04,479
Hey, aren’t you guys
going to do the windows?

320
00:33:08,269 --> 00:33:10,519
<i>Approaching landing coordinates.</i>

321
00:33:11,895 --> 00:33:13,978
Approach vector locked in.

322
00:33:43,436 --> 00:33:44,645
Magniﬁcent.

323
00:34:02,436 --> 00:34:05,020
Look at my beautiful new Nova plane.

324
00:34:05,686 --> 00:34:06,811
Nice work, Ratcher.

325
00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:09,187
Not yet.
Where’s my money?

326
00:34:10,102 --> 00:34:13,020
A man with priorities.
I like that.

327
00:34:17,311 --> 00:34:18,520
Half now.

328
00:34:18,977 --> 00:34:21,436
The rest when we ﬁnish
our little bombing mission.

329
00:34:29,644 --> 00:34:31,520
Next time you wear the mask.

330
00:34:35,311 --> 00:34:37,686
Look at my beautiful plane.

331
00:34:48,895 --> 00:34:50,062
Anything?

332
00:34:50,811 --> 00:34:52,020
Negative.

333
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:57,602
Got something.

334
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,810
Take us to 70 degrees and drop us to 30.

335
00:35:00,936 --> 00:35:02,895
70 degrees, drop to 30.

336
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,685
<i>Conﬁrmed sighting of the Nova.</i>

337
00:35:07,811 --> 00:35:11,769
<i>Appears to be in Libya,
inside some kind of structure.</i>

338
00:35:11,895 --> 00:35:15,143
Coordinates, four seven
eight by three seven zero.

339
00:35:15,269 --> 00:35:19,936
Repeat. Coordinates four seven
eight by three seven zero.

340
00:35:20,394 --> 00:35:22,186
Positive heat signature.

341
00:35:23,227 --> 00:35:24,686
Edwards, Connors.

342
00:35:25,853 --> 00:35:27,020
Go ahead, Vince.

343
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,312
<i>Jannick located the Nova.</i>

344
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:32,270
Copy that, Vince.

345
00:35:33,227 --> 00:35:35,638
There’s a deserted airstrip 7
clicks from those coordinates, sir.

346
00:35:35,728 --> 00:35:37,479
The SR71 can land there.

347
00:35:37,686 --> 00:35:38,686
Thank you, Colonel.

348
00:35:40,936 --> 00:35:44,185
Vince, proceed to eight
seven three zero point two.

349
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:46,561
You can land there.
And avoid enemy detection.

350
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,186
Okay, proceeding to rendezvous.

351
00:35:52,853 --> 00:35:54,978
Admiral Pendleton please, General Barnes.

352
00:35:56,603 --> 00:35:58,101
Admiral Pendleton.

353
00:35:58,227 --> 00:36:00,393
Admiral, we found the Nova
on the ground in Libya.

354
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:01,560
Copy that.

355
00:36:01,686 --> 00:36:03,851
I’m sending in a pair of men
for recovery.

356
00:36:03,977 --> 00:36:06,643
<i>We need air support and intelligence
on who we’re dealing with.</i>

357
00:36:06,769 --> 00:36:08,894
<i>Copy that, Pendleton out.</i>

358
00:36:10,311 --> 00:36:11,686
Starting landing site.

359
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,852
-Connors, Edwards.
-Copy.

360
00:36:30,019 --> 00:36:31,976
We’re working on a tight decision cycle.

361
00:36:32,102 --> 00:36:34,310
You’ve got twenty four hours
to get the plane back.

362
00:36:34,436 --> 00:36:35,978
What happens then?

363
00:36:36,144 --> 00:36:39,062
An aircraft carrier in the
Mediterranean will send in planes.

364
00:36:39,436 --> 00:36:41,020
They’ll carpet bomb the area.

365
00:36:41,977 --> 00:36:43,643
<i>It’ll start a war, sir.</i>

366
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:45,721
If we don’t get the plane
back in twenty four hours...

367
00:36:45,811 --> 00:36:47,638
they’ll have a chance
to organize a ﬁrst strike.

368
00:36:47,728 --> 00:36:49,851
Or duplicate the Nova’s technology.

369
00:36:49,977 --> 00:36:54,019
<i>The Nova drove the balance of power in
their favor with nuclear strike capacity.</i>

370
00:36:54,769 --> 00:36:55,811
Good luck, men.

371
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,936
What do you got from
Interpol on these people?

372
00:37:15,019 --> 00:37:16,602
They’re all part of a movement.

373
00:37:16,728 --> 00:37:19,060
It’s tied to a radical middle
eastern terrorist group.

374
00:37:19,186 --> 00:37:21,269
Well funded organized OP.

375
00:37:21,644 --> 00:37:25,435
Their MO isn’t money, it’s domination of
the free world by any means necessary.

376
00:37:25,561 --> 00:37:27,895
They’d use a nuclear bomb
without a second thought.

377
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:30,101
So they plan to nuke us.

378
00:37:30,227 --> 00:37:32,103
I'm afraid that’s what we must assume.

379
00:37:32,728 --> 00:37:34,354
There’s an airstrip here.

380
00:37:34,895 --> 00:37:37,895
Bridge, small village.

381
00:37:38,478 --> 00:37:39,937
We’re somewhere here.

382
00:37:40,436 --> 00:37:41,519
Shit.

383
00:37:42,811 --> 00:37:44,228
What are you thinking?

384
00:37:45,394 --> 00:37:46,934
We move to plan B.

385
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,727
I want you to stick with the stealth.
I may need air support.

386
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:51,518
I need the pictures.

387
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,853
Now, Wait, wait, wait.
You think that’s a good idea?

388
00:37:54,478 --> 00:37:57,145
Well, you got a better one?
Move.

389
00:37:57,977 --> 00:38:00,519
You could give me a few minutes.
Shit.

390
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:34,520
The plane went down
somewhere over here. Vit!

391
00:38:37,102 --> 00:38:39,853
Stay with the plane, that’s a great idea.

392
00:38:43,144 --> 00:38:44,853
-Let's go.
-We go.

393
00:38:46,811 --> 00:38:48,229
Ah shit.

394
00:39:04,394 --> 00:39:07,186
-And there’s no response to radio calls?
-None at all, sir.

395
00:39:09,728 --> 00:39:11,853
This is Admiral Pendleton US Navy.

396
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:14,769
<i>We’ve lost all contact
with Connors and Jannick.</i>

397
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:18,562
Sir, we’ve lost radio contact
with Connors and Jannick.

398
00:39:19,769 --> 00:39:20,894
Damn.

399
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:39,603
Halt, stop or I will shoot.

400
00:41:04,478 --> 00:41:08,354
According to the CIA this region is run
by the Graebner/Stone Terrorist Group.

401
00:41:08,603 --> 00:41:11,810
They make Bahder-Minhoff look like
a bunch of school yard bullies.

402
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,061
I want everything the CIA has on them.

403
00:41:14,769 --> 00:41:15,852
Right, sir.

404
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:23,394
What do we have here?

405
00:41:25,352 --> 00:41:27,270
It looks like an American pilot.

406
00:41:27,811 --> 00:41:29,770
So, Mr Pilot,
where is your plane?

407
00:41:30,311 --> 00:41:33,978
I parachuted in.
I’m a sky diver.

408
00:41:34,728 --> 00:41:36,810
You didn’t have to use this, eh?

409
00:41:36,936 --> 00:41:38,603
I always land on my feet.

410
00:41:40,977 --> 00:41:42,561
Where is the plane?

411
00:41:44,102 --> 00:41:47,185
-Why don’t you kiss my ass?
-I will kill you.

412
00:41:47,936 --> 00:41:49,296
What are you waiting for, asshole?

413
00:41:52,227 --> 00:41:56,436
Sir. We found the plane.
An American SR71.

414
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:02,061
<i>Stone, this is Elias.</i>

415
00:42:05,019 --> 00:42:06,436
What is it, Mr Elias?

416
00:42:06,686 --> 00:42:11,312
<i>We have found the pilot.
And an American SR71.</i>

417
00:42:13,478 --> 00:42:17,769
You found an American SR71?
Interesting.

418
00:42:17,895 --> 00:42:21,771
Another man was seen near the woods.
We’re searching for him now.

419
00:42:22,352 --> 00:42:25,186
-Bring in the pilot.
-And the SR71?

420
00:42:25,352 --> 00:42:26,602
I'll bring it in.

421
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,686
It’s being taken care of,
Mr Elias.

422
00:42:34,728 --> 00:42:37,268
CIA made me jump through
hoops for this stuff.

423
00:42:37,394 --> 00:42:40,101
Okay, Petar Stone, son of
a wealthy industrialist.

424
00:42:40,227 --> 00:42:43,018
Joined a skinhead faction at 16
where he met Jose Graebner...

425
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:44,727
Skip the bio’s, Colonel.

426
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:47,435
Okay, CIA has been monitoring
terrorist weapons buys,

427
00:42:47,561 --> 00:42:49,685
lately there’s been a change in methods.

428
00:42:49,811 --> 00:42:51,103
Which is?

429
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,020
They’ve been networking.
Forming buyers clubs.

430
00:42:55,478 --> 00:42:56,611
What are you telling me, Colonel?

431
00:42:56,702 --> 00:42:58,638
Terrorists are getting 10 percent
off on their guns?

432
00:42:58,811 --> 00:43:01,054
No, sir, group like Graebner
and Stone are joining forces...

433
00:43:01,144 --> 00:43:03,062
to buy weapons of mass destruction.

434
00:43:03,977 --> 00:43:05,060
Nuclear?

435
00:43:05,186 --> 00:43:07,687
At the very least, sir, they
could be chemical or biological.

436
00:43:10,144 --> 00:43:12,978
-Pass me through to Admiral Pendleton.
-Yes, sir.

437
00:43:18,436 --> 00:43:20,603
This is Admiral Pendleton, US Navy.

438
00:43:20,811 --> 00:43:23,312
Yes, Admiral.
<i>We’ve conﬁrmed they have nukes.</i>

439
00:43:23,686 --> 00:43:26,769
Jesus. <i>We can send in
our planes on a ﬂy over.</i>

440
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,270
Negative, Admiral.

441
00:43:29,311 --> 00:43:32,353
I don’t want to spook those
people into hiding the plane.

442
00:43:32,644 --> 00:43:36,228
If our team can’t get it back
we’ll have to go ahead with the bombing,

443
00:43:37,644 --> 00:43:40,978
-Destroy it, and anyone who’s seen it.
-Copy that.

444
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:43,095
Thank you, Admiral.

445
00:43:53,561 --> 00:43:56,561
Good evening, my friend.
I'm so glad you could make it.

446
00:43:57,352 --> 00:44:00,477
My name is Mr Stone and this
is my associate, Mr Elias.

447
00:44:00,728 --> 00:44:01,811
And your name is?

448
00:44:02,227 --> 00:44:03,310
Asshole.

449
00:44:04,186 --> 00:44:06,228
Yes. Mr asshole.

450
00:44:06,895 --> 00:44:08,854
So please tell me, Mr Asshole.

451
00:44:09,478 --> 00:44:13,477
I have some questions to ask you about
this Nova stealth ﬁghter plane.

452
00:44:13,603 --> 00:44:15,062
Oh, you just ask away.

453
00:44:26,561 --> 00:44:32,020
You let me know when you are
ready to cooperate. Alright?

454
00:45:44,311 --> 00:45:45,560
This is Stone, what is it?

455
00:45:45,686 --> 00:45:49,020
<i>We’ve located the other pilot. We
need help in searching the village.</i>

456
00:45:49,478 --> 00:45:51,354
I'll go take care of it.
Let’s go.

457
00:45:53,144 --> 00:45:54,394
Elias is on his way.

458
00:46:24,853 --> 00:46:26,103
Shit.

459
00:46:32,436 --> 00:46:33,686
Don’t move.

460
00:46:34,895 --> 00:46:36,187
Put up your hands.

461
00:46:37,269 --> 00:46:40,061
Okay, okay.

462
00:46:41,936 --> 00:46:43,437
Step away from the door.

463
00:46:45,895 --> 00:46:47,229
Slowly.

464
00:46:52,895 --> 00:46:54,270
Drop the gun.

465
00:46:56,519 --> 00:46:57,644
Drop the bag.

466
00:47:00,227 --> 00:47:01,644
Turn around.

467
00:47:03,561 --> 00:47:04,686
Slowly.

468
00:47:14,436 --> 00:47:15,686
Who are you?

469
00:47:16,936 --> 00:47:18,270
Open the door.

470
00:47:18,728 --> 00:47:21,062
One word and I'll kill
you, you understand?

471
00:47:22,558 --> 00:47:23,785
One word.

472
00:47:25,269 --> 00:47:26,644
Look at me.

473
00:47:28,352 --> 00:47:30,061
The door, Mela.

474
00:47:32,895 --> 00:47:34,479
A minute please.

475
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,353
<i>Just a minute.</i>

476
00:47:41,811 --> 00:47:42,851
What do you want?

477
00:47:42,977 --> 00:47:45,311
We are searching for an American spy.

478
00:47:45,853 --> 00:47:47,604
I am the only one here.

479
00:47:48,519 --> 00:47:49,769
We’ll see.

480
00:47:51,227 --> 00:47:54,435
This American, has killed
many of my patrol.

481
00:47:54,561 --> 00:47:56,936
Look if you want
but there is no man here.

482
00:47:57,478 --> 00:48:01,020
But you have had men here
before, Mela, haven’t you?

483
00:48:01,227 --> 00:48:03,186
That is none of your business.

484
00:48:03,811 --> 00:48:07,103
Everything in this town is my business.

485
00:48:07,728 --> 00:48:09,895
Graebner Stone’s business.

486
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:19,353
You have a lot of nice things
in this town, Mela.

487
00:48:20,227 --> 00:48:22,310
I can take them away from you.

488
00:48:23,102 --> 00:48:24,561
Leave you with nothing.

489
00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:27,102
Except my love for you.

490
00:48:40,478 --> 00:48:42,478
Is this what you are looking for?

491
00:48:47,436 --> 00:48:50,312
Perhaps I can help you ﬁnd what you want.

492
00:48:53,895 --> 00:48:56,604
Maybe you would like this?

493
00:49:33,217 --> 00:49:35,926
Yeah. What is it?

494
00:49:38,259 --> 00:49:39,551
I will be there.

495
00:49:40,967 --> 00:49:44,509
Our day will come.
Remember that.

496
00:49:55,009 --> 00:49:58,674
You watch her. She’s a dissident,
she cannot be trusted.

497
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,134
Okay, let’s go.

498
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,050
Nice gun collection.

499
00:50:22,425 --> 00:50:24,259
So you want to know why a...

500
00:50:24,467 --> 00:50:27,009
Why a woman like me
would have so many guns.

501
00:50:27,343 --> 00:50:28,341
Yeah.

502
00:50:28,467 --> 00:50:31,217
Because of this ﬁlthy government.

503
00:50:31,343 --> 00:50:34,925
They parcel out our land. They give our
towns and villages to these terrorists.

504
00:50:35,051 --> 00:50:38,593
And then they just come in here
and they just take whatever they want.

505
00:50:39,759 --> 00:50:42,301
So some of us are trying to stop them.

506
00:50:43,967 --> 00:50:45,925
To take the government
away from the military...

507
00:50:46,051 --> 00:50:47,883
and the terrorists and give...

508
00:50:48,009 --> 00:50:50,259
And give it back to the people.

509
00:50:50,675 --> 00:50:52,758
So you’re with the underground?

510
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:55,176
I am their leader.

511
00:50:57,343 --> 00:50:58,969
Bring it up, Chris.

512
00:51:05,051 --> 00:51:06,718
They haven’t budged.

513
00:51:09,134 --> 00:51:10,384
I don’t get it.

514
00:51:14,467 --> 00:51:16,424
11 hours, 52 minutes.
There’s still time.

515
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:17,633
Sir.

516
00:51:17,759 --> 00:51:19,187
Are we really going to destroy

517
00:51:19,278 --> 00:51:22,800
a 75 million dollar prototype
war plane if they fail?

518
00:51:22,926 --> 00:51:24,385
I have no choice, Colonel.

519
00:51:26,343 --> 00:51:27,385
You're insane.

520
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,592
Millions of people will die.

521
00:51:32,384 --> 00:51:36,218
That’s the point.
That’s what we’re counting on.

522
00:51:37,425 --> 00:51:42,633
Finally, you stupid Americans
with your free market invasion.

523
00:51:42,759 --> 00:51:45,635
You will know what it’s like
to have your culture destroyed.

524
00:51:46,508 --> 00:51:49,466
And from the ashes of
the corrupt western world,

525
00:51:49,592 --> 00:51:52,551
we will build a new civilization.

526
00:51:52,967 --> 00:51:54,759
Our primary target,

527
00:51:56,425 --> 00:51:57,926
The Paris Peace Talks.

528
00:51:58,176 --> 00:52:01,802
Presidents and Premiers
from all over the world will be on hand.

529
00:52:02,467 --> 00:52:06,093
At ﬁrst, they’ll think
it’s food poisoning.

530
00:52:06,592 --> 00:52:09,883
But then within 12 hours
they’ll all be dead.

531
00:52:10,009 --> 00:52:13,382
And thanks to your Nova Stealth ﬁghter...

532
00:52:13,508 --> 00:52:15,674
they'll never know what hit them.

533
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,426
Which will leave us free
to go on to our second target.

534
00:52:21,384 --> 00:52:23,593
The State of Kansas.

535
00:52:24,842 --> 00:52:26,343
What is it you call it?

536
00:52:28,051 --> 00:52:29,091
The Heartland?

537
00:52:29,217 --> 00:52:32,259
Well I hope they appreciate
our little heart attack.

538
00:52:32,842 --> 00:52:34,676
You know, we’ll be ﬂying in two days.

539
00:52:35,467 --> 00:52:39,509
-It’s a pity you’ll be dead.
-We’ll see who'll be dead, asshole.

540
00:52:42,967 --> 00:52:46,217
Maybe the arrogant American pilot...

541
00:52:46,343 --> 00:52:48,677
knows something that I don’t know.

542
00:52:49,301 --> 00:52:54,843
Maybe a smart man would
move his mission forward.

543
00:52:56,759 --> 00:53:00,091
This is Stone, fuel the planes.

544
00:53:00,217 --> 00:53:01,549
We ﬂy this morning.

545
00:53:01,675 --> 00:53:04,634
You people are too stupid
to ﬂy that plane.

546
00:53:05,675 --> 00:53:07,675
Ah yes, but I’ve thought of everything.

547
00:53:08,134 --> 00:53:12,259
I’ve recently acquired
a very gifted American pilot.

548
00:53:15,675 --> 00:53:16,884
Ratcher?

549
00:53:17,134 --> 00:53:19,134
So how is my favorite student?

550
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:25,759
Shame you missed your funeral,
it was real touching.

551
00:53:27,217 --> 00:53:29,176
I wasn’t talking about you, Richard.

552
00:53:30,051 --> 00:53:32,552
How’s my old buddy Vince Connors?

553
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:39,260
I need to get to this airstrip,
right here.

554
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:43,510
This is a very difﬁcult
region to get to now.

555
00:53:43,842 --> 00:53:47,884
They have patrols guarding everywhere.
They will be searching for you.

556
00:53:48,259 --> 00:53:51,968
There will be a check point right
here, and another one right here.

557
00:53:52,134 --> 00:53:54,175
Yes, I know. And another
one right here.

558
00:53:54,301 --> 00:53:56,384
Look, it’s almost morning.
I’m running out of time.

559
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,009
No, this is impossible in the daytime.

560
00:53:59,343 --> 00:54:01,385
You will be captured, they'll kill you.

561
00:54:04,217 --> 00:54:05,718
I will make it through.

562
00:54:08,634 --> 00:54:10,510
That’s not what I wanted to hear.

563
00:54:11,926 --> 00:54:13,760
You're being crazy.

564
00:54:13,967 --> 00:54:17,758
Look, in six hours and
twenty eight minutes...

565
00:54:17,884 --> 00:54:21,593
they're gonna carpet bomb this place.
Do you know what that means?

566
00:54:23,384 --> 00:54:25,801
You are going to destroy my country.

567
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,009
Yes. Yes.

568
00:54:34,884 --> 00:54:37,218
The decision, thank god,
I didn’t have to make.

569
00:54:38,759 --> 00:54:40,051
And I’m sorry.

570
00:54:43,092 --> 00:54:44,509
I’m truly sorry.

571
00:54:46,092 --> 00:54:47,509
I’ve got to go.

572
00:54:48,842 --> 00:54:50,009
Thank you.

573
00:54:50,176 --> 00:54:51,343
Wait.

574
00:54:52,425 --> 00:54:56,092
My cousin, Rojar, he has a fruit truck.

575
00:55:21,634 --> 00:55:22,634
Who is it?

576
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,342
<i>It is your cousin Rojar.
I bring you melons.</i>

577
00:55:27,092 --> 00:55:28,509
Rojar.

578
00:55:32,051 --> 00:55:34,718
Oh, Rojari Ber.

579
00:55:35,092 --> 00:55:37,884
Friend, you have American cigarettes?

580
00:56:01,217 --> 00:56:04,424
You send me American cigarettes
we both make a lot of money.

581
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:06,008
Sure.
And Coca-cola.

582
00:56:06,134 --> 00:56:07,635
Yea, get in here.

583
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:12,301
Get in Get in.

584
00:56:16,467 --> 00:56:19,218
Hey, What are you doing?

585
00:56:20,051 --> 00:56:25,301
Selling fresh produce.
Melons, oranges, onions.

586
00:56:25,592 --> 00:56:28,675
Here. For you.

587
00:56:29,384 --> 00:56:31,010
-American cigarettes?
-No.

588
00:56:31,259 --> 00:56:33,468
I go before they spoil.

589
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:38,092
Jeber, produce king.

590
00:56:52,176 --> 00:56:54,259
I want these armed and loaded now.

591
00:56:57,259 --> 00:57:00,010
-How much longer?
-It’ll be ready.

592
00:57:02,842 --> 00:57:04,801
Be in the air in one hour.

593
00:57:18,508 --> 00:57:21,549
Hey, tell me, you like American cowboy?

594
00:57:21,675 --> 00:57:25,008
Shut up, Rojar.
What about the check point?

595
00:57:25,134 --> 00:57:28,217
Check point?
We drive straight through.

596
00:57:28,343 --> 00:57:30,052
What if they search the truck?

597
00:57:31,634 --> 00:57:36,051
Then we ﬁnd out if old fruit cart
can out run motorcycles.

598
00:57:45,343 --> 00:57:50,052
Good morning, General, I have
produce, fresh for your pilots.

599
00:57:50,343 --> 00:57:52,716
I must hurry before the sun wilts them.

600
00:57:52,842 --> 00:57:54,343
Let me see your papers.

601
00:57:54,508 --> 00:57:56,717
You are not_a general, you’re a private.

602
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,342
Rojar Jeber, the produce king.

603
00:58:00,884 --> 00:58:04,843
I deliver produce
to the colonel himself. Here.

604
00:58:06,051 --> 00:58:08,925
-This is for you and your friend.
-Let’s check your cargo.

605
00:58:09,051 --> 00:58:12,760
Don’t check my cargo. Don’t put
your dirty hands on my cargo.

606
00:58:12,926 --> 00:58:17,093
Don’t you mix up everything,
chickpeas, carrots, onions, don’t!

607
00:58:46,217 --> 00:58:50,342
-Should have put in new spark plugs.
-Fine.

608
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:02,426
-They’re gaining.
-You go like wind you ancient cart.

609
00:59:38,425 --> 00:59:40,301
Rojar, drive faster.

610
00:59:57,508 --> 00:59:58,675
Get my gun.

611
01:00:04,759 --> 01:00:06,343
Get him,

612
01:00:09,467 --> 01:00:11,093
Rojar, get him.

613
01:00:25,842 --> 01:00:27,718
He’s gaining on us.

614
01:00:30,301 --> 01:00:31,510
Dammit.

615
01:00:45,759 --> 01:00:47,468
-Kick him.
-Yeah, but..

616
01:00:51,425 --> 01:00:53,259
Use stranglehold.

617
01:01:27,384 --> 01:01:31,093
Stop. Stop. Tum it around.
Turn it around.

618
01:01:31,842 --> 01:01:35,092
What? Are you crazy?
Go back.

619
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:38,550
Right. Right.

620
01:01:46,842 --> 01:01:49,050
There's only two hours left
on the clock, sir.

621
01:01:49,176 --> 01:01:50,927
Is the carrier on station?

622
01:01:51,176 --> 01:01:54,674
Yes, sir. The Admiral's giving the wing
commanders his ﬁnal brieﬁng right now.

623
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,259
Good.

624
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:02,475
Sir, I’ve got the best ﬁghter pilots

625
01:02:02,566 --> 01:02:04,577
waiting for immediate
departure on your command.

626
01:02:04,717 --> 01:02:06,674
Our information leads us to believe

627
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:10,424
the President will upgrade
the situation to Defcon 3.

628
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:13,841
<i>It is therefore imperative
that you take out Stone</i>...

629
01:02:13,967 --> 01:02:15,841
<i>before the Nova can launch.</i>

630
01:02:15,967 --> 01:02:18,800
<i>Make sure that you burn
it all, nothing left.</i>

631
01:02:18,926 --> 01:02:20,466
Sir, what’s our primary target?

632
01:02:20,592 --> 01:02:24,633
<i>Take out the airﬁeld, the hangar
and any outbuildings in the vicinity.</i>

633
01:02:24,759 --> 01:02:25,759
Yes, sir.

634
01:02:25,926 --> 01:02:31,051
<i>Good luck, Lieutenant.</i>
You may be out last line of defense.

635
01:02:31,217 --> 01:02:33,509
Yes, sir, I’ll get my men
in the air immediately.

636
01:02:38,717 --> 01:02:40,509
Get me the President.

637
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:08,549
The planes are out in the wide open.

638
01:03:10,508 --> 01:03:11,758
Yeah.

639
01:03:12,926 --> 01:03:15,091
They probably got Jannick in that hangar.

640
01:03:15,217 --> 01:03:18,884
So why do you help this man?
Who is he to you? A friend?

641
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:25,926
Deﬁnitely not a friend.

642
01:03:28,009 --> 01:03:31,008
You do not like this man but
you risk yourself to rescue him.

643
01:03:31,134 --> 01:03:32,894
He’s my partner,
I'm not leaving without him.

644
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:34,426
Even if it kills you?

645
01:03:34,717 --> 01:03:38,134
I’d rather die doing what’s right
than live doing what’s wrong.

646
01:03:38,301 --> 01:03:39,468
You’re a good man.

647
01:03:43,217 --> 01:03:45,634
I wish there were more men
like you in my country.

648
01:03:49,842 --> 01:03:51,551
Thank you.

649
01:04:00,343 --> 01:04:03,468
I thought the American cowboy
no kiss girl.

650
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:08,093
Sometimes they do.

651
01:04:15,592 --> 01:04:18,551
Sir, Connors and Jannick
are still in the area.

652
01:04:18,717 --> 01:04:22,259
I know, Colonel, they still
have two hours left.

653
01:04:22,759 --> 01:04:25,635
We have to give them time
to get the Nova back intact.

654
01:04:26,051 --> 01:04:30,134
If they do, I'll call it off.
If not...

655
01:04:51,467 --> 01:04:55,591
This is squadron leader. Our ETA to.
Target is one hour four seven minutes.

656
01:04:55,717 --> 01:05:01,093
Our orders are to roast and toast.
No survivors.

657
01:05:34,259 --> 01:05:36,259
<i>Patrol to Stone, Patrol to Stone.</i>

658
01:05:36,842 --> 01:05:37,925
What is it?

659
01:05:38,176 --> 01:05:39,968
<i>Sir, we are being attacked.</i>

660
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:42,217
-It’s Connors.
-Come.

661
01:05:42,343 --> 01:05:44,050
-You’re dead, Ratcher.
-Guard him.

662
01:05:44,176 --> 01:05:45,927
You’re both dead.

663
01:06:22,592 --> 01:06:23,759
Behind you!

664
01:06:42,884 --> 01:06:44,802
-Mela.
-Yeah?

665
01:06:47,009 --> 01:06:48,009
Mela.

666
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:55,093
Get up.

667
01:07:00,134 --> 01:07:01,926
You two, Men, Come here!

668
01:07:02,759 --> 01:07:04,093
You okay?

669
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,050
Never better.

670
01:07:07,759 --> 01:07:09,093
You shouldn’t have come here.

671
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:12,800
You should have gotten your ass in that
plane and gotten the hell out of here.

672
01:07:14,134 --> 01:07:17,052
Your life was in my hands, remember?

673
01:07:20,926 --> 01:07:22,427
I didn’t tell them anything.

674
01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:24,884
I know.

675
01:07:25,842 --> 01:07:28,760
-Can you ﬂy?
-Like a bird.

676
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:34,133
Good, I’m going to need cover
ﬁre and that Nova’s no UAB.

677
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:37,135
Vince, Ratcher’s alive.

678
01:07:40,009 --> 01:07:42,009
He stole the Nova, faked his own death.

679
01:07:42,176 --> 01:07:43,549
How do you know that?

680
01:07:43,675 --> 01:07:45,593
Because I saw the asshole.

681
01:07:46,384 --> 01:07:48,718
He’s going to ﬂy the
bombing mission for them.

682
01:07:49,259 --> 01:07:50,633
He’s as sick as they are.

683
01:07:50,759 --> 01:07:54,051
Shit. I got more ammo.
Let’s go.

684
01:07:54,217 --> 01:07:55,300
Come on.

685
01:07:59,217 --> 01:08:01,801
So, this is your day.

686
01:08:05,134 --> 01:08:06,509
The day you die.

687
01:08:54,301 --> 01:08:57,384
Ratcher, the plane. Go, go now.

688
01:08:59,009 --> 01:09:00,885
Cover me. Shit.

689
01:09:29,176 --> 01:09:30,885
Now. Move. Go.

690
01:09:38,842 --> 01:09:39,925
Mela.

691
01:10:22,759 --> 01:10:25,424
OK, ETA to target is two, three minutes.

692
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:27,384
Look alive guys, look sharp.

693
01:10:27,842 --> 01:10:31,509
Keep your eagles open,
<i>don’t want no surprises.</i>

694
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:45,134
Jannick.

695
01:10:46,717 --> 01:10:47,759
No.

696
01:10:52,343 --> 01:10:53,552
No.

697
01:10:56,717 --> 01:10:58,092
Jannick.

698
01:10:58,343 --> 01:11:01,010
I’m about up now, partner.

699
01:11:02,092 --> 01:11:04,259
Come on.
Common, we’re going.

700
01:11:04,634 --> 01:11:07,758
No. You try to take me out of
here we’re both going to die.

701
01:11:07,884 --> 01:11:09,218
No.

702
01:11:10,051 --> 01:11:11,760
You give me the slaver.

703
01:11:12,592 --> 01:11:14,301
Blow this place to hell.

704
01:11:17,508 --> 01:11:18,717
Come on.

705
01:11:36,759 --> 01:11:38,468
You give them hell, partner.

706
01:11:41,176 --> 01:11:43,135
You give them, Hell.

707
01:11:53,301 --> 01:11:54,510
Ratch.

708
01:11:58,051 --> 01:11:59,260
Put the gun down.

709
01:12:01,176 --> 01:12:02,843
I said put it down.

710
01:12:13,051 --> 01:12:15,677
Vincent, nice to see you again.

711
01:12:15,967 --> 01:12:18,925
-What the hell are you doing, Ratch?
-Getting rich.

712
01:12:19,051 --> 01:12:20,424
Getting rich?

713
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:22,967
Do you know how much
I’m getting paid for this?

714
01:12:23,467 --> 01:12:26,134
This is treason, Ratch.
This is treason.

715
01:13:36,134 --> 01:13:40,843
Connors has escaped.
Let’s go take back our life.

716
01:13:44,092 --> 01:13:46,341
Attention, GS squadron leader.

717
01:13:46,467 --> 01:13:48,674
<i>This is GS squadron leader.</i>

718
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,384
The American has stolen my Nova plane.

719
01:13:52,592 --> 01:13:56,674
Shoot him down.
I repeat, shoot him down.

720
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,676
<i>Copy that, missile armed and ready.</i>

721
01:14:29,717 --> 01:14:30,967
Common!

722
01:14:38,717 --> 01:14:40,092
Come on, come on.

723
01:15:08,259 --> 01:15:13,135
My old friend Mr Jannick.
Not so arrogant now, huh?

724
01:15:15,301 --> 01:15:16,841
Time to die, Captain.

725
01:15:16,967 --> 01:15:19,676
Wait, I’ve got something for you.

726
01:15:22,842 --> 01:15:24,634
Jannick’s little parting gift.

727
01:15:29,717 --> 01:15:32,967
Courtesy of the United States Air Force.

728
01:15:37,009 --> 01:15:38,510
Asshole.

729
01:17:22,508 --> 01:17:25,675
Hey, Kemosabe.
Kemosabe.

730
01:17:31,259 --> 01:17:32,676
We did it.

731
01:17:41,717 --> 01:17:44,716
Edwards, this is Black Thunder.
Connors, do you read?

732
01:17:44,842 --> 01:17:46,382
Vince, General Barnes.
Go ahead.

733
01:17:46,508 --> 01:17:49,050
General, the good news
is I have the Nova.

734
01:17:49,425 --> 01:17:52,841
<i>I am at seventeen point
0 four three degrees east.</i>

735
01:17:52,967 --> 01:17:55,509
<i>And the Tropic of the Cancer,
headed north.</i>

736
01:17:55,675 --> 01:17:58,382
Roger, Vince, copy that.
What's the bad news?

737
01:17:58,508 --> 01:18:01,134
I'm carrying two big NBC bombs.

738
01:18:01,301 --> 01:18:05,008
I’m afraid if I take a hit and go down
I take half a continent with me.

739
01:18:05,134 --> 01:18:06,676
Roger, Vince, stand by one.

740
01:18:07,759 --> 01:18:08,758
You were right, sir.

741
01:18:08,884 --> 01:18:11,466
Those bombs have biological
capacity as well as nuclear.

742
01:18:11,592 --> 01:18:14,246
Give me all the information on possible
fallout scenarios, Colonel.

743
01:18:14,372 --> 01:18:15,822
Yes, sir.

744
01:18:26,051 --> 01:18:28,343
Vince, we’ve got a squadron
ﬁve minutes east of you.

745
01:18:29,092 --> 01:18:32,092
I can’t go east, I got Ratcher on my six.

746
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:33,883
Ratcher?
Ratcher’s dead.

747
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:36,593
No, sir, he faked his death
to steal the Nova.

748
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:42,836
Sorry. Sir, I’ve got to cut you out.
I got Ratcher on my tail.

749
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:07,259
<i>You are entering French airspace,
please identify yourself.</i>

750
01:19:07,467 --> 01:19:10,925
<i>If you do not identify yourself you
will be shot down. Do you understand?</i>

751
01:19:11,051 --> 01:19:13,758
Do not shoot, I repeat, do not shoot.

752
01:19:13,884 --> 01:19:17,258
I'm an American Air Force pilot
being chased by unfriendly aircraft.

753
01:19:17,384 --> 01:19:19,752
Vince, you’ve got to keep Ratcher
off your tail. Help’s on the way,

754
01:19:19,842 --> 01:19:21,676
Just hold on for three more minutes.

755
01:19:32,675 --> 01:19:36,549
Give it up, Vincent,
you know I’m the better pilot.

756
01:19:36,675 --> 01:19:39,460
Hey, Ratchet, I’ve picked up a few tricks
since then, I think you’ll like them.

757
01:19:39,550 --> 01:19:42,759
Tricks.
That’s all they are, Vincent.

758
01:19:43,675 --> 01:19:46,134
I can out-fly you
in a school bus.

759
01:19:48,759 --> 01:19:52,718
One well placed hit might
take the whole plane down.

760
01:19:53,717 --> 01:19:55,343
Take Europe down.

761
01:19:57,217 --> 01:19:59,801
Stone’s dead, Tom,
there’s no one to pay for this.

762
01:20:00,009 --> 01:20:01,676
I’ve already been paid.

763
01:20:02,009 --> 01:20:05,051
Have you perished, make nice the revenge.

764
01:20:06,092 --> 01:20:08,342
Drop the load, Vincent,
I’ll let you live?

765
01:20:08,759 --> 01:20:10,468
<i>We could be partners.</i>

766
01:20:10,675 --> 01:20:13,299
<i>Why ﬂy against each other
when we can ﬂy together?</i>

767
01:20:13,425 --> 01:20:16,217
Kill millions of people?
Come on, Ratch, for what?

768
01:20:16,343 --> 01:20:18,010
For millions of dollars.

769
01:20:18,884 --> 01:20:20,633
What do you care about those people?

770
01:20:20,759 --> 01:20:24,468
From up here, they’re nothing.
So small you can’t even see them.

771
01:20:24,634 --> 01:20:27,260
If you could get a hundred
dollars for each one who died.

772
01:20:27,675 --> 01:20:29,384
Sorry, Tom, no deal.

773
01:20:33,134 --> 01:20:35,093
I’m the one who’s sorry.

774
01:20:37,842 --> 01:20:40,884
If Nova’s shot down over Europe
the gas will spread like this.

775
01:20:42,051 --> 01:20:43,051
12 hours.

776
01:20:44,301 --> 01:20:45,551
24 hours.

777
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:47,967
36 hours.

778
01:20:49,176 --> 01:20:50,218
48 hours.

779
01:20:51,242 --> 01:20:52,283
Jesus.

780
01:22:58,051 --> 01:23:00,969
You can’t hit me cause
you can’t see me, Ratch.

781
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:03,176
I don’t have to see you, Vincent,

782
01:23:04,051 --> 01:23:06,343
I just have to predict where you are.

783
01:23:49,550 --> 01:23:51,717
Shit, heat seekers.

784
01:24:07,051 --> 01:24:08,468
It’s right behind you, Connors.

785
01:24:11,550 --> 01:24:15,342
Hey, Ratch.
You taught me, you taught Jannick.

786
01:24:15,675 --> 01:24:17,634
But you forgot to teach yourself.

787
01:24:49,508 --> 01:24:51,758
Edwards, this is Black Thunder.
Do you read?

788
01:24:56,425 --> 01:24:59,384
Threat neutralized.
I'm on my way home.

789
01:25:04,634 --> 01:25:09,843
Admiral, the situation is diffused.
<i>You can call off your boys.</i>

790
01:25:10,009 --> 01:25:13,800
Great, great.
Mike, you can call off the B-3's.

791
01:25:13,926 --> 01:25:15,841
The job has been taken care of.

792
01:25:15,967 --> 01:25:19,593
And damn well
taken care of if I may say so.

793
01:25:21,967 --> 01:25:24,426
<i>Vince, great job.</i>

794
01:25:31,259 --> 01:25:35,051
Sony, red. Connors got them
this time, we’ll get them next time.

795
01:25:35,926 --> 01:25:37,260
Let’s take it home.

796
01:25:46,051 --> 01:25:48,426
-Good job, Colonel.
-You too, sir.

797
01:25:52,042 --> 01:25:53,209
Let’s get a drink.

798
01:26:17,842 --> 01:26:19,051
How are you doing?

799
01:26:41,384 --> 01:26:42,593
Welcome back, Vince.

800
01:26:45,508 --> 01:26:47,342
Sorry to hear about Captain Jannick.

801
01:26:48,343 --> 01:26:50,343
Thank you, sir, he's a good man.

802
01:26:50,996 --> 01:26:53,153
Vince, they’ll be a medal
in this for you.

803
01:26:56,467 --> 01:26:57,550
Sir...

804
01:27:01,134 --> 01:27:03,217
If anyone deserves a medal,

805
01:27:08,176 --> 01:27:09,468
It’s Jannick.

806
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:13,217
Give it to him, sir.

807
01:27:21,425 --> 01:27:24,759
Hell of a mission, sir.
I didn’t think he could pull it off.

808
01:27:25,301 --> 01:27:26,885
You’re damn right, Colonel.

809
01:27:28,884 --> 01:27:32,508
I hate to mention this now, sir,
but there’s one more thing.

810
01:27:32,634 --> 01:27:33,716
Yes, what is it?

811
01:27:33,842 --> 01:27:37,259
That SR71. It’s still out
in the Libyan desert, sir.

812
01:27:40,675 --> 01:27:41,967
You're right.

813
01:27:43,343 --> 01:27:45,885
And there’s only one man
who can go in and get it.

814
01:27:48,375 --> 01:27:49,876
Oh, Vince.
