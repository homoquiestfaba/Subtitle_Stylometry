00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:40,469
(whooshing)
(tinkling)

4
00:00:45,466 --> 00:00:48,216
- Cold and ice on a moonlit night

5
00:00:49,997 --> 00:00:53,747
bring forth thy power,
bring forth thy might.

6
00:00:56,495 --> 00:00:58,245
Bring forth thy power

7
00:00:59,996 --> 00:01:01,829
bring forth thy might.

8
00:01:02,793 --> 00:01:05,376
Ice and cold on a moonlit night

9
00:01:06,605 --> 00:01:08,355
bring forth thy power

10
00:01:10,345 --> 00:01:12,178
bring forth thy might.

11
00:01:14,595 --> 00:01:15,678
Mix and bind.

12
00:01:18,696 --> 00:01:20,979
(crackling)

13
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:22,062
Mix and bind.

14
00:01:28,996 --> 00:01:29,996
Life I gift,

15
00:01:32,475 --> 00:01:33,642
life I pledge,

16
00:01:36,993 --> 00:01:37,993
life I gift,

17
00:01:40,763 --> 00:01:41,930
life I pledge,

18
00:01:45,232 --> 00:01:47,482
life I gift, life I pledge.

19
00:01:50,864 --> 00:01:53,114
Life I gift, life I pledge,

20
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:56,471
life I gift.

21
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:02,766
Take this freely given
to restore the power.

22
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:07,112
Come,

23
00:02:08,425 --> 00:02:09,258
cold one.

24
00:02:12,292 --> 00:02:13,542
I command thee.

25
00:02:14,996 --> 00:02:15,829
Come.

26
00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:22,283
(bubbling)
(crackling)

27
00:02:22,283 --> 00:02:25,033
(dramatic music)

28
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:38,858
- Who,

29
00:02:41,123 --> 00:02:44,040
who dares to call on banshee power?

30
00:02:46,015 --> 00:02:47,426
- I did.

31
00:02:47,426 --> 00:02:49,674
- Then complete the spell.

32
00:02:49,674 --> 00:02:51,923
Give me a shape to take.

33
00:02:51,923 --> 00:02:52,756
Hurry!

34
00:02:53,847 --> 00:02:55,847
Free me, give me a body.

35
00:02:59,655 --> 00:03:02,684
- I don't have one, I didn't know.

36
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:04,948
(wailing)

37
00:03:04,948 --> 00:03:05,781
- Simpson,

38
00:03:07,556 --> 00:03:09,056
are you down here?

39
00:03:11,095 --> 00:03:13,462
(crackling)

40
00:03:13,462 --> 00:03:15,379
Simpson we have guests.

41
00:03:17,884 --> 00:03:19,671
- Give me a body!

42
00:03:19,671 --> 00:03:20,504
Hurry!

43
00:03:21,356 --> 00:03:22,273
- Take her.

44
00:03:26,022 --> 00:03:28,439
(crying out)

45
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:32,544
(crackling)

46
00:03:39,105 --> 00:03:41,272
(wailing)

47
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,560
(cackling)

48
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:52,386
- 5,000 years with no form
and now I am free, free!

49
00:03:54,107 --> 00:03:56,735
(thudding)

50
00:03:56,735 --> 00:04:00,926
And you human, what would you have me do?

51
00:04:00,926 --> 00:04:01,759
- Obey me.

52
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:07,613
- I think not, I have work to do.

53
00:04:07,613 --> 00:04:11,305
5,000 years I have waited
and watched and learned.

54
00:04:11,305 --> 00:04:13,296
- But I freed you.

55
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:14,129
- Silence!

56
00:04:15,616 --> 00:04:20,529
Or your reward will be death
and not the riches you crave.

57
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:21,696
Find me a man,

58
00:04:23,586 --> 00:04:24,503
a rich man.

59
00:04:25,522 --> 00:04:28,059
A man with influence and power.

60
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,105
A man who will help me
with this abomination

61
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,522
you call science.

62
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,660
What we cannot defeat, turn against you

63
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,730
and that will be your reward, human.

64
00:04:45,735 --> 00:04:49,902
(crackling)
(dramatic music)

65
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:16,798

66
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:32,978

67
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,412

00:05:58,028 --> 00:06:00,278
(sparking)

70
00:06:11,016 --> 00:06:15,183
(water splashing)
(sputtering)

71
00:06:16,483 --> 00:06:19,077
- Well, well that's it, that's it.

72
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:20,572
I'm not getting up next spring

73
00:06:20,572 --> 00:06:24,070
if I can't find something
else to wake me up.

74
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,966
Pesky rabbits, they're
as bad as the squirrels.

75
00:06:26,966 --> 00:06:28,216
No help at all.

76
00:06:29,173 --> 00:06:33,262
How come it's always me
that gets wet and never you?

77
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:35,119
Well I'll tell you for why.

78
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:37,829
'Cause you're too damn smart
for you own good that's why.

79
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:38,996
Pesky rabbits.

80
00:06:41,254 --> 00:06:45,004
(soft wind instrument music)

81
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:49,560
Well it's about time you
found your own place.

82
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,688
Well I don't know why you like living here

83
00:06:51,688 --> 00:06:54,021
you've got your own burrows.

84
00:06:58,513 --> 00:07:00,401
(coughing)

85
00:07:00,401 --> 00:07:03,234
Where's all that dust coming from?

86
00:07:06,682 --> 00:07:09,792
You were supposed to keep the place clean,

87
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:14,214
that's the deal, food and lodging
for a little housekeeping.

88
00:07:14,214 --> 00:07:17,131
(teapot whistling)

89
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,010
(creaking)

90
00:07:25,325 --> 00:07:27,470
Never let it be said old
Finn McCool takes anything

91
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,553
for nothing or gives
anything for nothing either.

92
00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:35,207
Oh I hate water.

93
00:07:35,207 --> 00:07:36,861
Water and little people don't mix,

94
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:39,028
never have and never will.

95
00:07:50,201 --> 00:07:52,868
(roof rumbling)

96
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:58,840
(animal squeaking)

97
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,257
(whimpering)

98
00:08:06,997 --> 00:08:10,639
(tractor banging)

99
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,306
Couldn't believe it.

100
00:08:39,215 --> 00:08:40,048
Oh no.

101
00:08:41,758 --> 00:08:43,744
I can't believe it!

102
00:08:43,744 --> 00:08:45,744
Where's my forests gone?

103
00:08:47,492 --> 00:08:49,882
Saint Patrick preserve us.

104
00:08:49,882 --> 00:08:52,549
(tree creaking)

105
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:57,262
(thudding)

106
00:08:57,262 --> 00:09:00,139
(saw buzzing)

107
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:03,733
Where have all these people come from?

108
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:06,983
Oh, and me lovely trees, just logs now.

109
00:09:12,895 --> 00:09:15,728
(tractor humming)

110
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:27,439
(gentle instrumental music)

111
00:09:29,132 --> 00:09:30,622
Well I don't get it.

112
00:09:30,622 --> 00:09:32,543
Nobody bothers to wake me up.

113
00:09:32,543 --> 00:09:33,931
They let me sleep.

114
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:36,660
Half me forest gone, nobody says a word.

115
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,889
Unbelievable, unbelievable.

116
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:41,678
Oh, oh, those pesky rabbits.

117
00:09:41,678 --> 00:09:44,076
Unreliable, always have been.

118
00:09:44,076 --> 00:09:47,170
You see they don't live in
trees, so they don't care.

119
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,917
Well, I'll bet getting
to the bottom of this.

120
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:50,870
Believe me, they'll rule the day

121
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,165
they crossed Finn Regan McCool.

122
00:09:54,165 --> 00:09:57,665
(soft instrumental music)

123
00:10:12,535 --> 00:10:15,285
Oh oh, why's it so bloomin' cold?

124
00:10:21,675 --> 00:10:24,752
(lively instrumental music)

125
00:10:24,752 --> 00:10:27,585
(crank squeaking)

126
00:11:09,561 --> 00:11:10,561
Rig this up.

127
00:11:12,392 --> 00:11:13,225
Wooah!

128
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:20,707
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

129
00:11:20,707 --> 00:11:24,418
Ahh, ahh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

130
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:26,186
(screaming)

131
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,944
(crashing)

132
00:11:27,944 --> 00:11:29,709
(chickens squawking)

133
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:31,273
(rooster crowing)

134
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,523
(coughing)

135
00:11:35,232 --> 00:11:37,844
When will they stop movin' things?

136
00:11:37,844 --> 00:11:40,436
- Go in there, come on, let's go.

137
00:11:40,436 --> 00:11:43,076
We aint' got time, come on.

138
00:11:43,076 --> 00:11:43,909
Hup!

139
00:11:44,963 --> 00:11:46,948
Come on, come on, you know we have to go.

140
00:11:46,948 --> 00:11:49,498
We've been there a thousand times before.

141
00:11:49,498 --> 00:11:50,331
Come on.

142
00:11:51,665 --> 00:11:53,575
That's a good girl, good girl, come on.

143
00:11:53,575 --> 00:11:55,075
Get, get, come on.

144
00:11:56,432 --> 00:11:58,121
Get in here, come on.

145
00:11:58,121 --> 00:11:59,538
Move away, right.

146
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:08,103
All right, Getta, now wait for me.

147
00:12:10,086 --> 00:12:12,909
(upbeat instrumental music)

148
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:15,659
(Finn chuckling)

149
00:12:21,035 --> 00:12:24,035
(chicken squawking)

150
00:12:27,432 --> 00:12:30,294
(Finn humming)

151
00:12:30,294 --> 00:12:31,127
- Oh, oh!

152
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,030
(chuckling)

153
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,447
(clattering)

154
00:12:39,788 --> 00:12:40,621
Ahhh!

155
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,013
Ahhh.

156
00:12:47,203 --> 00:12:49,370
(banging)

157
00:12:54,647 --> 00:12:56,980
(shivering)

158
00:12:58,796 --> 00:13:01,463
(gold tinkling)

159
00:13:04,455 --> 00:13:07,045
(chuckling)

160
00:13:07,045 --> 00:13:09,919
(energetic music)

161
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:14,086
(whooshing)
(tinkling)

162
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,339
- Morning, Mary.

163
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:42,050
- You're finished early, this mornin'.

164
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,287
- Oh, the first of the month.

165
00:13:43,287 --> 00:13:45,648
Don't wanna hang around
the dairy too long today.

166
00:13:45,648 --> 00:13:48,813
- Oh, Ned, you superstitious old goat.

167
00:13:48,813 --> 00:13:50,831
Do you think the little people have time

168
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:52,420
to waste on you?

169
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,828
- Show a little respect for the old ways.

170
00:13:55,828 --> 00:13:57,856
That's what I say.

171
00:13:57,856 --> 00:14:00,579
You know, if you don't mess
with the little people,

172
00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:02,404
they won't mess with you.

173
00:14:02,404 --> 00:14:05,981
- (laughing) Really, Ned.

174
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:08,316
- Ooh, cake, is it?

175
00:14:08,316 --> 00:14:10,752
All ready for the young visitors, then?

176
00:14:10,752 --> 00:14:12,045
- As I'll ever be.

177
00:14:12,045 --> 00:14:15,290
It'll be good to have
kids about the place.

178
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,055
Would you care to be my taster?

179
00:14:17,055 --> 00:14:19,170
- Oh, well don't mind if I do.

180
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,603
- I baked it fresh this mornin'.

181
00:14:20,603 --> 00:14:22,794
- [Ned] Oh, chocolate, me favorite.

182
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:24,997
- Now, there's a surprise.

183
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:27,654
- Hey, oh ho ho, this is good.

184
00:14:27,654 --> 00:14:29,051
Mm, delicious.

185
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:31,377
You've outdone yourself this time, Mary.

186
00:14:31,377 --> 00:14:32,725
You know, it must be awful tough

187
00:14:32,725 --> 00:14:34,325
to be this Barridge fella.

188
00:14:34,325 --> 00:14:35,568
- [Mary] Tough?

189
00:14:35,568 --> 00:14:37,712
I think Barridge can do
just about what he pleases

190
00:14:37,712 --> 00:14:38,633
in the world.

191
00:14:38,633 --> 00:14:40,734
How tough can that be?

192
00:14:40,734 --> 00:14:42,616
- [Ned] Well pretty tough, I reckon.

193
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:44,271
You know, being a multimillionaire

194
00:14:44,271 --> 00:14:48,360
has it's fair share of problems
and worries too, I imagine.

195
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,877
- [Mary] (laughing) I wouldn't
mind having his worries

196
00:14:50,877 --> 00:14:52,794
if I had all his money.

197
00:14:57,817 --> 00:15:00,067
(grunting)

198
00:15:01,948 --> 00:15:04,569
- [Ned] Well since his
wife died, he never spends

199
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:06,242
any time in America.

200
00:15:06,242 --> 00:15:07,487
- [Mary] Oh?

201
00:15:07,487 --> 00:15:09,456
- [Ned] He has houses everywhere,

202
00:15:09,456 --> 00:15:11,295
but doesn't enjoy them.

203
00:15:11,295 --> 00:15:12,802
He's always flying around the world

204
00:15:12,802 --> 00:15:14,959
attending to his businesses.

205
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,177
- [Mary] How sad.

206
00:15:16,177 --> 00:15:20,047
He probably never sees his poor kids.

207
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:23,070
Hopefully they can be together here.

208
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,735
- [Ned] You know, money's not everything.

209
00:15:24,735 --> 00:15:28,041
There's other things just as important.

210
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,453
- Mr. Simpson, good morning.

211
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:31,453
- Ms. Riley.

212
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:36,038
- Morning, Mr. Simpson.

213
00:15:36,038 --> 00:15:37,621
- Tea, Mr. Simpson?

214
00:15:38,815 --> 00:15:40,746
- You've gone to a lot of trouble, Mary.

215
00:15:40,746 --> 00:15:43,763
I hope the Barridge
children will appreciate it.

216
00:15:43,763 --> 00:15:45,027
- I'm sure they will.

217
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:49,176
I've never known a kid yet
who can resist me jam tarts.

218
00:15:49,176 --> 00:15:51,676
- We don't want to spoil them.

219
00:15:54,601 --> 00:15:56,601
(soft instrumental music)

220
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:57,434
Gooey.

221
00:16:02,957 --> 00:16:04,721
- Well if you don't spoil 'em,

222
00:16:04,721 --> 00:16:07,238
no one else around here's
going to, that's for sure.

223
00:16:07,238 --> 00:16:09,270
- [Mary] Ms. Duvann's really
excited about them coming.

224
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,103
- Why?

225
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:11,068
That's what I want to know.

226
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:12,474
She never was much for men,

227
00:16:12,474 --> 00:16:13,903
now she's for marrying.

228
00:16:13,903 --> 00:16:16,811
Can't get around in those crazy clothes.

229
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:18,973
And now she's not the same as she was.

230
00:16:18,973 --> 00:16:21,142
- [Mary] Oh, Ned, you're
such a stick in the mud.

231
00:16:21,142 --> 00:16:22,990
If you had your way,
nothing would ever change.

232
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,025
- [Ned] (laughing) You
know, sometimes change

233
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,195
is not everything it's
made out to be, Mary.

234
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,500
- [Mary] Ned, I'm sure Ms. Duvann

235
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,170
will make Mr. Barridge very happy.

236
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,371
- Heh, maybe you're right.

237
00:16:32,371 --> 00:16:34,613
- [Mary] He needs a wife
and mother for his children,

238
00:16:34,613 --> 00:16:36,663
and they'll have a stable home life.

239
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,583
- [Ned] Mr. Barridge is still a young man,

240
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,647
and a good catch, to boot.

241
00:16:40,647 --> 00:16:43,887
Anyhow, time I was gettin' back to work.

242
00:16:43,887 --> 00:16:47,773
Some of us have to earn a living here.

243
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,806
Right, thanks for the tea.

244
00:16:49,806 --> 00:16:50,723
- Pleasure.

245
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:57,949
Ned?

246
00:16:57,949 --> 00:17:00,199
(tinkling)

247
00:17:06,334 --> 00:17:07,917
Ned, you old rogue.

248
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:11,369
I won't fall for that one.

249
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:22,942
(water trickling)

250
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,443
(Finn humming)

251
00:17:46,656 --> 00:17:48,275
- Oh, oh!

252
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:51,025
(dramatic music)

253
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:55,799
(grunting)

254
00:17:57,013 --> 00:17:58,919
(shouting)

255
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:01,252
(splashing)

256
00:18:04,272 --> 00:18:05,922
- Where'd he come from?

257
00:18:05,922 --> 00:18:07,672
- He's awfully small.

258
00:18:09,113 --> 00:18:11,062
- Maybe he's one of the little people.

259
00:18:11,062 --> 00:18:12,935
- A leprechaun?

260
00:18:12,935 --> 00:18:17,102
(groaning)
(splashing)

261
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:23,862
- Creepy.

262
00:18:26,053 --> 00:18:28,796
I've got a bad feeling.

263
00:18:28,796 --> 00:18:30,846
I don't like the look of this.

264
00:18:30,846 --> 00:18:32,611
I wanna go home.

265
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,752
- We have to give it a try, Tommy.

266
00:18:34,752 --> 00:18:36,807
We promised Dad.

267
00:18:36,807 --> 00:18:39,474
- But I don't want a new mother.

268
00:18:42,494 --> 00:18:45,494
(suspenseful music)

269
00:18:58,473 --> 00:19:01,056
(horn honking)

270
00:19:14,092 --> 00:19:15,729
What a dump!

271
00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:16,906
It's horrible.

272
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:17,739
- Shh!

273
00:19:38,598 --> 00:19:39,515
- Darlings!

274
00:19:41,187 --> 00:19:42,687
Welcome, darlings.

275
00:19:48,425 --> 00:19:50,896
We're going to have the whole holiday

276
00:19:50,896 --> 00:19:53,846
just to get to know each
other, isn't that marvelous?

277
00:19:53,846 --> 00:19:57,839
- Yes.
(Laura laughing)

278
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:59,506
- Simpson, the bags.

279
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:05,710
When I saw your father's
photograph in Business Weekly,

280
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:09,034
I knew we were destined for one another.

281
00:20:09,034 --> 00:20:10,751
Come along, come along, don't dawdle.

282
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,501
I've got a lovely room all ready.

283
00:20:19,383 --> 00:20:20,905
- [Mary] Hello.

284
00:20:20,905 --> 00:20:23,738
- Oh, yes, this is Mary, the cook.

285
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,972
- Hi Mary, my name is Ethel
and this is my brother, Tommy.

286
00:20:27,972 --> 00:20:30,150
- Don't the two of you
look grand, to be sure.

287
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,718
I have a lovely tea all ready,

288
00:20:31,718 --> 00:20:33,524
and lots of ideas of games and things

289
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,133
when you've had a chance to settle in.

290
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:36,940
- Oh, that'd be wonderful, thank you.

291
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,023
- Yes, quite.

292
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,464
Why don't you run back to
the kitchen, Mary dear,

293
00:20:41,464 --> 00:20:44,047
I'm sure you've got lots to do.

294
00:20:45,146 --> 00:20:46,220
- Excuse us.

295
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,470
Come on, Tommy.

296
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,910
(grunting)

297
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:12,759
- She is so weird.

298
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:17,315
- That hat, I wouldn't
be seen dead in that hat.

299
00:21:17,315 --> 00:21:21,482
(clattering)
(gasping)

300
00:21:29,116 --> 00:21:31,731
- Dad said this was a real mansion,

301
00:21:31,731 --> 00:21:33,289
but it's just a dump.

302
00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:36,255
- Just like her, all on being grand.

303
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:39,340
- And a twig short of a full nest.

304
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,572
- Now darling, don't be so cruel.

305
00:21:42,572 --> 00:21:47,329
- [Tommy] Just like her. (laughing)

306
00:21:47,329 --> 00:21:49,162
- Tea is being served.

307
00:21:50,627 --> 00:21:52,158
- I hope that means food.

308
00:21:52,158 --> 00:21:53,241
I'm starving.

309
00:21:59,423 --> 00:22:03,506
Did you see his face? (laughing)

310
00:22:08,383 --> 00:22:12,050
(lively instrumental music)

311
00:22:19,732 --> 00:22:21,567
(Finn chuckling)

312
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:23,051
- Cut down my trees, would ya.

313
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:24,104
I'll show ya.

314
00:22:24,104 --> 00:22:26,354
(tinkling)

315
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:31,047
(bird cawing)

316
00:22:48,331 --> 00:22:49,782
I'll show ya.

317
00:22:49,782 --> 00:22:51,449
Do not mess with me.

318
00:23:01,962 --> 00:23:03,243
- Start her up.

319
00:23:03,243 --> 00:23:05,269
(engine cranking)
(sparking)

320
00:23:05,269 --> 00:23:06,806
(men shouting)

321
00:23:06,806 --> 00:23:07,892
Who did this?

322
00:23:07,892 --> 00:23:10,014
(tinkling)
(shrieking)

323
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:11,368
(exploding)

324
00:23:11,368 --> 00:23:13,859
(Finn chuckling)

325
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,056
(lively instrumental music)

326
00:23:16,056 --> 00:23:18,639
(Finn humming)

327
00:23:24,505 --> 00:23:26,563
(men speaking simultaneously)

328
00:23:26,563 --> 00:23:28,655
- Someone's really been muckin' about.

329
00:23:28,655 --> 00:23:32,322
(Finn blowing through lips)

330
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,300
- What is going on here?

331
00:23:42,612 --> 00:23:44,281
- Someone sabotaged.

332
00:23:44,281 --> 00:23:45,308
- What?

333
00:23:45,308 --> 00:23:47,860
Get these things moving!

334
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,269
- I'm sorry, Ma'am, I can't,
not this side of a week.

335
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:51,102
- A week?

336
00:23:52,442 --> 00:23:53,275
A week.

337
00:23:54,647 --> 00:23:57,705
Are you telling me
there won't be any trees

338
00:23:57,705 --> 00:24:00,378
cut down the whole week?

339
00:24:00,378 --> 00:24:01,929
- I'm sorry, Ma'am, but
these tires are special,

340
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:02,762
you know, big.

341
00:24:02,762 --> 00:24:04,435
We can't just go anywhere for them.

342
00:24:04,435 --> 00:24:06,204
- Well, what about the spares?

343
00:24:06,204 --> 00:24:08,900
- Well we have one spare
per tractor in most cases,

344
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,927
but all the tires are ruined.

345
00:24:11,927 --> 00:24:12,760
- No!

346
00:24:13,964 --> 00:24:14,797
No!

347
00:24:17,843 --> 00:24:20,260
(whimpering)

348
00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:26,854
I want you to find out who did it.

349
00:24:26,854 --> 00:24:30,591
I want you to find out, and tell me.

350
00:24:30,591 --> 00:24:33,008
And get these vehicles fixed!

351
00:24:34,703 --> 00:24:36,317
(shouting)

352
00:24:36,317 --> 00:24:38,261
(thudding)

353
00:24:38,261 --> 00:24:39,178
Come along!

354
00:24:43,424 --> 00:24:45,039
(tinkling)

355
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,113
- (gasping) Wow, gold!

356
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:51,196
Ethel, look what I found.

357
00:24:52,102 --> 00:24:53,935
- No, no, that's mine!

358
00:24:56,373 --> 00:24:57,796
That's not right.

359
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,266
Thief, thief!

360
00:24:59,266 --> 00:25:02,099
(engine igniting)

361
00:25:04,686 --> 00:25:05,519
- Idiots.

362
00:25:07,268 --> 00:25:09,238
- What a beautiful forest, Ms. Duvann.

363
00:25:09,238 --> 00:25:11,174
The trees must be very old.

364
00:25:11,174 --> 00:25:14,189
- They are just trees, you silly girl.

365
00:25:14,189 --> 00:25:16,439
Dirty, bug-ridden monsters.

366
00:25:18,813 --> 00:25:22,980
Darling, you know what I mean. (chuckling)

367
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:25,024
Now,

368
00:25:26,622 --> 00:25:30,205
please, please, you
must call me Laura, hm?

369
00:25:31,305 --> 00:25:33,715
Because in just a few months,

370
00:25:33,715 --> 00:25:36,293
your daddy and I are going to be married.

371
00:25:36,293 --> 00:25:39,834
Won't that be wonderful? (laughing)

372
00:25:39,834 --> 00:25:43,751
And you, Tommy, we mustn't
forget you, must we?

373
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:46,482
Now, sit up straight, don't slouch.

374
00:25:46,482 --> 00:25:48,482
It's not good to slouch.

375
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,530
(cat meowing)

376
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,321
(groaning)

377
00:26:05,321 --> 00:26:07,158
(clattering)

378
00:26:07,158 --> 00:26:09,491
(chuckling)

379
00:26:27,098 --> 00:26:29,909
(whimpering)

380
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:32,098
(gold tinkling)

381
00:26:32,098 --> 00:26:33,940
- You know, I don't like it here.

382
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,380
I don't like Laura, or this house,

383
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,840
or anything about it.

384
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,106
And Dad can't marry her, I won't let him.

385
00:26:39,106 --> 00:26:40,738
- Don't be silly, Tommy.

386
00:26:40,738 --> 00:26:42,635
It doesn't work like
that, and you know it.

387
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:44,959
Look, we've only been here for two days.

388
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:49,442
She must be nice, or Dad
wouldn't wanna marry her.

389
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:52,393
- Maybe Dad is sick or something.

390
00:26:52,393 --> 00:26:54,722
And she keeps pinching me.

391
00:26:54,722 --> 00:26:56,583
- There's no need to throw a tantrum.

392
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:59,187
- I'm not throwing a tantrum.

393
00:26:59,187 --> 00:27:00,140
- Oh really?

394
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,996
(whacking)
(Finn shrieking)

395
00:27:03,996 --> 00:27:05,437
(children gasping)

396
00:27:05,437 --> 00:27:06,723
- What was that?

397
00:27:06,723 --> 00:27:11,423
(Finn screaming)
(splashing)

398
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:13,673
(bubbling)

399
00:27:15,706 --> 00:27:17,745
- Help, help, I can't swim!

400
00:27:17,745 --> 00:27:19,745
- He needs help!
- Help!

401
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,343
Help, I can't swim!

402
00:27:27,473 --> 00:27:29,487
- He's coming, Tommy's coming.

403
00:27:29,487 --> 00:27:31,218
- Hang on, I'm coming.
- Oh no.

404
00:27:31,218 --> 00:27:33,718
- I'm here, give me your hand.

405
00:27:35,093 --> 00:27:37,132
- Tommy!
- Come on, stop struggling.

406
00:27:37,132 --> 00:27:38,926
- Grab the other arm, well, pull harder.

407
00:27:38,926 --> 00:27:40,576
- Come on, grab hold of the side.

408
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,460
- Careful, you don't tear me coat.

409
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,263
You've got to grab me.

410
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:45,594
(splashing)

411
00:27:45,594 --> 00:27:46,427
- Oh no!

412
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:54,060
(coughing)

413
00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:04,612
Tommy, are you all right?

414
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,561
- Well he's fine.

415
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:10,432
It's me own good self
that needed some help.

416
00:28:10,432 --> 00:28:12,071
Damn fool kids.

417
00:28:12,071 --> 00:28:13,466
- Sorry!

418
00:28:13,466 --> 00:28:14,299
- Sorry?

419
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:16,875
Would that be all you've
got to say for yourself?

420
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:19,052
(coughing)

421
00:28:19,052 --> 00:28:21,802
(fire crackling)

422
00:28:30,473 --> 00:28:32,099
- Quick!

423
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:34,099
- [Simpson] Tea, Madame.

424
00:28:40,253 --> 00:28:42,003
- Thank you, Simpson.

425
00:28:42,886 --> 00:28:45,719
(dishes clinking)

426
00:28:50,515 --> 00:28:53,014
- Is your room nice and, (groaning)

427
00:28:53,014 --> 00:28:53,847
Ohh!

428
00:28:55,258 --> 00:28:56,091
Oh.

429
00:28:58,196 --> 00:29:01,863
(lively instrumental music)

430
00:29:03,138 --> 00:29:07,305
(banging)
(shrieking)

431
00:29:29,748 --> 00:29:32,201
- Nobody must know you're here.

432
00:29:32,201 --> 00:29:34,284
That'll take care of him.

433
00:29:41,843 --> 00:29:43,018
(sneezing)

434
00:29:43,018 --> 00:29:44,288
Gesundheit.

435
00:29:44,288 --> 00:29:45,506
- Ah, thank you.

436
00:29:45,506 --> 00:29:47,028
- Thank you,

437
00:29:47,028 --> 00:29:49,210
for almost killing me.

438
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:51,371
- Oh, don't start that again.

439
00:29:51,371 --> 00:29:53,121
What the devil were you doing on the ledge

440
00:29:53,121 --> 00:29:55,194
in the first place?

441
00:29:55,194 --> 00:29:57,661
- I love children, but
I couldn't (mumbles)

442
00:29:57,661 --> 00:29:58,685
- What?

443
00:29:58,685 --> 00:30:00,795
What did you say?
- Tommy.

444
00:30:00,795 --> 00:30:02,717
- Well, all he ever does is complain.

445
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,575
- Hey, you stole me gold.

446
00:30:04,575 --> 00:30:06,127
- I did not, I found it.

447
00:30:06,127 --> 00:30:07,293
- You took it, and it wasn't yours.

448
00:30:07,293 --> 00:30:08,166
You stole it.

449
00:30:08,166 --> 00:30:10,148
- Oh, stop it, both of you.

450
00:30:10,148 --> 00:30:11,623
This is getting us nowhere.

451
00:30:11,623 --> 00:30:13,269
Tommy, give him back his gold.

452
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:14,950
- No, how do we know it's his?

453
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,145
- Because I said it was.

454
00:30:16,145 --> 00:30:19,057
- And we're supposed to believe you?

455
00:30:19,057 --> 00:30:21,422
- I'll have you know
that Fearless Finn McCool

456
00:30:21,422 --> 00:30:23,707
has never told a lie in his whole life.

457
00:30:23,707 --> 00:30:25,567
- Fearless? (laughing)

458
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:26,400
Fearless?

459
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,360
Help, help, I can't swim.

460
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,935
- I'll show ya fearless.

461
00:30:29,935 --> 00:30:32,121
(thudding)
(grunting)

462
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:35,121
(children laughing)

463
00:30:36,624 --> 00:30:38,291
- Are you all right?

464
00:30:46,133 --> 00:30:48,466
(tinkling)

465
00:30:48,466 --> 00:30:49,966
I didn't steal it.

466
00:30:51,513 --> 00:30:53,501
- And I suppose you saved me life,

467
00:30:53,501 --> 00:30:55,155
so I'm a little beholden.

468
00:30:55,155 --> 00:30:57,121
- I don't think we want
you to be beholden.

469
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,590
Can't we just be friends?

470
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,479
We never met a leprechaun before.

471
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:02,076
- But you're not supposed
to meet a leprechaun,

472
00:31:02,076 --> 00:31:03,023
now are ya?

473
00:31:03,023 --> 00:31:05,078
Pity you keep getting
me wet, now, don't ya?

474
00:31:05,078 --> 00:31:07,207
I can't go invisible
when I'm wet, now, can I?

475
00:31:07,207 --> 00:31:09,010
- How many of you are there?

476
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:10,850
- Me, wouldn't you know
it, Fearless Finn McCool,

477
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:13,956
last king of the
leprechauns, at your service.

478
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:15,389
- (laughing) King?

479
00:31:15,389 --> 00:31:16,501
Well if I'm the last one,

480
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:17,900
that'd mean I'd have to be the king

481
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,477
now wouldn't it, little smarty pants?

482
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:20,866
- Aren't you lonely?

483
00:31:20,866 --> 00:31:21,924
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

484
00:31:21,924 --> 00:31:23,726
I've got lots of friends.

485
00:31:23,726 --> 00:31:25,609
- So what happened to the others?

486
00:31:25,609 --> 00:31:27,109
- They ran after gold.

487
00:31:27,109 --> 00:31:27,942
- So?

488
00:31:27,942 --> 00:31:29,854
- Well don't you know nothin', boy?

489
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,320
It's the weight of the gold in his pockets

490
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,379
that makes us the little people.

491
00:31:33,379 --> 00:31:34,366
- So what happens when you haven't

492
00:31:34,366 --> 00:31:36,023
got any gold in your pockets?

493
00:31:36,023 --> 00:31:38,097
- Well, we grow, obviously.

494
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:39,191
- [Tommy] How big?

495
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:40,124
- Well, big.

496
00:31:40,124 --> 00:31:41,585
- I mean, how big?

497
00:31:41,585 --> 00:31:44,625
- Well, giant size, so big that we pop.

498
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:45,458
Pop!

499
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:46,606
And then we're gone, pop!

500
00:31:46,606 --> 00:31:48,077
(children groaning)

501
00:31:48,077 --> 00:31:49,327
- That's gross!

502
00:31:49,327 --> 00:31:50,160
Uh, uh!

503
00:31:51,317 --> 00:31:52,150
Uh, yuck.

504
00:31:54,002 --> 00:31:56,669
(clock ticking)

505
00:32:07,894 --> 00:32:11,727
(eerie wind instrument music)

506
00:32:18,456 --> 00:32:22,330
- Those children are up to something.

507
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:24,961
- Didn't you ever play, Simpson?

508
00:32:24,961 --> 00:32:27,885
Is that why you took refuge in magic?

509
00:32:27,885 --> 00:32:30,420
Lonely little boy seeking out power

510
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,576
instead of friends.

511
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,298
- Don't mock me, banshee.

512
00:32:34,298 --> 00:32:37,131
It was my power that brought you here.

513
00:32:37,131 --> 00:32:38,298
- No, Simpson.

514
00:32:39,217 --> 00:32:40,717
You have no power.

515
00:32:41,965 --> 00:32:43,632
Power is an essence.

516
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:47,396
It is what we are, or are not.

517
00:32:49,657 --> 00:32:53,973
All you have is magic, magic
makes you more powerful,

518
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:55,814
but you are not power.

519
00:32:55,814 --> 00:32:56,910
- And you are?

520
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:57,910
- Yes, I am.

521
00:32:58,827 --> 00:33:00,509
- Then why are we messing
about with all these stupid

522
00:33:00,509 --> 00:33:01,543
marriage plans?

523
00:33:01,543 --> 00:33:04,081
Why this stupid business
deal with Henry Barridge?

524
00:33:04,081 --> 00:33:05,603
Why don't you just go ahead and do exactly

525
00:33:05,603 --> 00:33:07,225
what you want to do?

526
00:33:07,225 --> 00:33:11,553
- Hmm, because power
has its limits, Simpson.

527
00:33:11,553 --> 00:33:13,782
The marriage is a diversion.

528
00:33:13,782 --> 00:33:17,119
I chose Henry Barridge because I need him.

529
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:20,058
He will make me more powerful still.

530
00:33:20,058 --> 00:33:21,025
- How?

531
00:33:21,025 --> 00:33:22,653
- You'll see.

532
00:33:22,653 --> 00:33:24,393
The well of power under this house

533
00:33:24,393 --> 00:33:27,143
is awfully small, don't ya think?

534
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:32,442
(suspenseful string music)

535
00:33:32,442 --> 00:33:35,109
(clock ticking)

536
00:33:37,244 --> 00:33:38,520
(clock chiming)
(gasping)

537
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,353
- Holy hop nails.

538
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:40,186
- Shh!

539
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:42,171
Come on, quick, this way!

540
00:33:42,171 --> 00:33:44,286
- I wish I'd gone back out the window.

541
00:33:44,286 --> 00:33:45,335
- Don't be silly.

542
00:33:45,335 --> 00:33:47,367
You've already been out
the window once today.

543
00:33:47,367 --> 00:33:48,814
- What if someone sees us?

544
00:33:48,814 --> 00:33:52,981
- They won't, they're all
getting ready for dinner.

545
00:33:58,701 --> 00:34:00,201
- Quick, this way!

546
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:11,997
(eerie music)
(wind howling)

547
00:34:19,873 --> 00:34:20,706
- Banshee.

548
00:34:20,706 --> 00:34:23,079
Heaven preserve us.

549
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:24,412
- She's a witch?

550
00:34:32,694 --> 00:34:34,939
My stepmother's a witch!

551
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:37,762
- She's a water spirit, she's not a witch.

552
00:34:37,762 --> 00:34:40,538
- Like I care what kinda spirit she is.

553
00:34:40,538 --> 00:34:42,602
- Any minute now I'm going to wake up.

554
00:34:42,602 --> 00:34:43,769
- We're awake.

555
00:34:43,769 --> 00:34:46,299
- We have to warn Daddy!

556
00:34:46,299 --> 00:34:48,854
- I think we better be
getting out of here.

557
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:50,395
- I knew something was wrong.

558
00:34:50,395 --> 00:34:51,867
(Simpson throat clearing)
(children gasping)

559
00:34:51,867 --> 00:34:54,588
(tinkling)

560
00:34:54,588 --> 00:34:56,755
- What are you doing here?

561
00:34:57,866 --> 00:35:01,527
- Aren't we being a little
rude, sneaking around my house?

562
00:35:01,527 --> 00:35:02,944
- We were hungry.

563
00:35:04,042 --> 00:35:05,164
- Hmm?

564
00:35:05,164 --> 00:35:06,831
- Poor little dears.

565
00:35:08,759 --> 00:35:10,283
(stomping)
(crackling)

566
00:35:10,283 --> 00:35:12,002
- [Tommy] Come on!

567
00:35:12,002 --> 00:35:14,673
(Laura screaming)

568
00:35:14,673 --> 00:35:15,673
- Stop them!

569
00:35:21,192 --> 00:35:23,442
Or they'll ruin everything!

570
00:35:25,746 --> 00:35:27,939
(thudding)
(groaning)

571
00:35:27,939 --> 00:35:29,293
- Mary, she's after us!

572
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:30,126
She's a witch!

573
00:35:30,126 --> 00:35:31,525
- She is Mary, we saw her!

574
00:35:31,525 --> 00:35:33,200
She has blue hair and yellow eyes.

575
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,666
Hide!

576
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:38,583
(Laura shrieking and groaning)

577
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:41,972
- What's wrong?

578
00:35:41,972 --> 00:35:42,884
What's happening?

579
00:35:42,884 --> 00:35:43,866
- I don't know.

580
00:35:43,866 --> 00:35:45,472
- Well, are they sick?

581
00:35:45,472 --> 00:35:47,139
They could get hurt.

582
00:35:48,775 --> 00:35:51,594
(suspenseful music)

583
00:35:51,594 --> 00:35:53,927
(shrieking)

584
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:18,474
(tinkling)
(banging)

585
00:36:18,474 --> 00:36:21,211
(groaning)

586
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:23,461
(tinkling)

587
00:36:27,729 --> 00:36:30,479
(Laura groaning)

588
00:36:32,753 --> 00:36:33,586
There!

589
00:36:36,142 --> 00:36:37,142
- Over here.

590
00:36:39,048 --> 00:36:40,505
- What are we going to do?

591
00:36:40,505 --> 00:36:41,484
- I don't know.

592
00:36:41,484 --> 00:36:43,309
- Where's Finn?

593
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:44,142
- Listen.

594
00:36:46,698 --> 00:36:48,017
- [Tommy] They're coming!

595
00:36:48,017 --> 00:36:49,630
This way.

596
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,463
- Ah ha.

597
00:36:51,344 --> 00:36:52,594
- [Tommy] Here.

598
00:36:56,193 --> 00:36:57,941
- You try over there.

599
00:36:57,941 --> 00:36:59,441
I'll try the barn.

600
00:37:00,994 --> 00:37:03,827
(rooster crowing)

601
00:37:11,045 --> 00:37:13,462
(cow mooing)

602
00:37:22,226 --> 00:37:25,143
(children gasping)

603
00:37:41,705 --> 00:37:42,622
- Oh, yuck.

604
00:37:45,789 --> 00:37:46,622
Gross.

605
00:37:52,124 --> 00:37:52,957
Quick!

606
00:38:15,768 --> 00:38:18,768
(suspenseful music)

607
00:38:24,921 --> 00:38:27,254
(crackling)

608
00:38:28,277 --> 00:38:29,527
- Ethel, Tommy.

609
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,743
Here kitty, kitty, kitty.

610
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,569
Come out dears, there's good children,

611
00:38:42,569 --> 00:38:44,152
before I get angry.

612
00:38:45,454 --> 00:38:49,204
Believe me, you won't
like me when I'm angry.

613
00:38:52,691 --> 00:38:54,774
This is your last chance.

614
00:38:57,764 --> 00:39:00,991
(Finn chuckling)
(Laura shrieking)

615
00:39:00,991 --> 00:39:03,243
(crackling)

616
00:39:03,243 --> 00:39:04,326
- Run, quick!

617
00:39:06,249 --> 00:39:07,082
Hurry!

618
00:39:08,385 --> 00:39:09,849
(whacking)

619
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:11,557
(thudding)

620
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:12,640
Hurry, quick!

621
00:39:19,988 --> 00:39:21,071
- Get moving!

622
00:39:22,232 --> 00:39:23,815
Ah, you're useless!

623
00:39:23,815 --> 00:39:26,232
(indistinct shouting)

624
00:39:26,232 --> 00:39:28,899
(Laura wailing)

625
00:39:39,446 --> 00:39:41,028
(banging)

626
00:39:41,028 --> 00:39:43,361
(screaming)

627
00:39:45,309 --> 00:39:47,642
(crackling)

628
00:39:51,523 --> 00:39:54,784
(Laura laughing)

629
00:39:54,784 --> 00:39:55,617
- Ah well,

630
00:39:58,197 --> 00:39:59,030
well.

631
00:40:03,502 --> 00:40:06,585
What a shame, the dear little kiddies

632
00:40:08,379 --> 00:40:10,129
have no where to run.

633
00:40:11,019 --> 00:40:12,705
- Stay away from us.

634
00:40:12,705 --> 00:40:14,718
- (laughing) Or what?

635
00:40:14,718 --> 00:40:16,129
- Or I'll tell Daddy.

636
00:40:16,129 --> 00:40:17,547
- I'll tell Daddy.

637
00:40:17,547 --> 00:40:19,633
Well he's not here, though, is he?

638
00:40:19,633 --> 00:40:22,050
There's only me, and Simpson.

639
00:40:23,414 --> 00:40:25,727
So why don't you be nice,

640
00:40:25,727 --> 00:40:29,144
little children, and come to mommy Laura?

641
00:40:30,434 --> 00:40:32,541
Come on, come to me.

642
00:40:32,541 --> 00:40:33,671
- Look out!

643
00:40:33,671 --> 00:40:36,259
(Finn chuckling)
(shouting)

644
00:40:36,259 --> 00:40:38,563
(splashing)

645
00:40:38,563 --> 00:40:39,396
- Yuck

646
00:40:40,459 --> 00:40:41,292
Go!

647
00:40:43,918 --> 00:40:44,862
- Gotcha.

648
00:40:44,862 --> 00:40:46,087
- Let us go!

649
00:40:46,087 --> 00:40:47,953
(crackling)

650
00:40:47,953 --> 00:40:49,355
Get off, let go.
- Let go!

651
00:40:49,355 --> 00:40:52,022
- Someone wants a word with you.

652
00:40:53,528 --> 00:40:56,111
- I am going to boil you alive,

653
00:41:00,449 --> 00:41:03,949
pluck your eyes out, and fry them as eggs,

654
00:41:07,516 --> 00:41:11,599
pick your bones clean,
and feed them to the pigs.

655
00:41:12,785 --> 00:41:14,118
I hate children!

656
00:41:16,733 --> 00:41:17,983
- Laura, hello?

657
00:41:20,433 --> 00:41:21,345
Kids?

658
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:22,678
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

659
00:41:24,663 --> 00:41:27,129
- She's after us, she's going to get us.

660
00:41:27,129 --> 00:41:28,324
- She's a witch, Dad.

661
00:41:28,324 --> 00:41:30,397
She's gonna boil us alive
and throw us to the pigs.

662
00:41:30,397 --> 00:41:32,854
- Laura, what on earth is going on here?

663
00:41:32,854 --> 00:41:35,428
- Henry, thank God you've arrived.

664
00:41:35,428 --> 00:41:36,405
- Stay away.

665
00:41:36,405 --> 00:41:37,812
- No, Daddy, she's a witch.

666
00:41:37,812 --> 00:41:39,345
- Stop it.
- Keep away.

667
00:41:39,345 --> 00:41:41,621
- I said stop it.
- She's a witch, Dad.

668
00:41:41,621 --> 00:41:43,788
She's going to boil us alive
and throw us to the pigs!

669
00:41:43,788 --> 00:41:45,882
- I said stop it, enough!

670
00:41:45,882 --> 00:41:47,538
- Henry, thank goodness you're here.

671
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:48,421
- Help, Daddy!

672
00:41:48,421 --> 00:41:50,220
- I just don't know what to do. (wailing)

673
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,374
- That is enough!

674
00:41:52,374 --> 00:41:56,581
- I thought we were getting along so well.

675
00:41:56,581 --> 00:42:00,414
Oh, but they've just
been behaving so beastly.

676
00:42:02,468 --> 00:42:06,151
They called me a witch,
and they attacked me.

677
00:42:06,151 --> 00:42:07,376
- That's not true.

678
00:42:07,376 --> 00:42:08,209
- Ethel.

679
00:42:08,209 --> 00:42:09,507
- Well it isn't.

680
00:42:09,507 --> 00:42:11,074
- Go to your rooms.

681
00:42:11,074 --> 00:42:12,824
- But--
- Both of you!

682
00:42:16,053 --> 00:42:17,873
I don't understand this.

683
00:42:17,873 --> 00:42:19,580
- I'll see they get cleaned up for dinner.

684
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,143
- Thank you.

685
00:42:21,143 --> 00:42:24,643
(soft instrumental music)

686
00:42:25,917 --> 00:42:28,286
- Don't be too hard on them, Henry dear.

687
00:42:28,286 --> 00:42:30,661
I'm sure that once they get to know me

688
00:42:30,661 --> 00:42:32,536
things will be fine. (crying)

689
00:42:32,536 --> 00:42:33,697
- It's okay.
- They're just,

690
00:42:33,697 --> 00:42:35,774
they're really just such lovely children.

691
00:42:35,774 --> 00:42:38,191
I could just eat them all up.

692
00:42:39,494 --> 00:42:42,483
(crackling)

693
00:42:42,483 --> 00:42:45,400
(Laura whimpering)

694
00:42:50,354 --> 00:42:52,612
- Why won't anyone believe us?

695
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:55,314
- Stop it, Tommy, you're imagining things.

696
00:42:55,314 --> 00:42:57,379
- Well, if he loved us, he'd believe us.

697
00:42:57,379 --> 00:43:00,194
- Your father thinks the world of you.

698
00:43:00,194 --> 00:43:01,944
- He doesn't show it.

699
00:43:02,864 --> 00:43:05,815
Sometimes, sometimes I think he wishes

700
00:43:05,815 --> 00:43:08,438
we died in the car instead of Mommy.

701
00:43:08,438 --> 00:43:09,271
- Ethel.

702
00:43:13,135 --> 00:43:15,389
Ethel, don't say that.

703
00:43:15,389 --> 00:43:17,107
I know it doesn't look like it,

704
00:43:17,107 --> 00:43:21,060
but in his heart, your father
truly loves you, believe me.

705
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,380
It's just that he finds it
hard to show his feelings,

706
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,235
that's all.

707
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:26,549
- He can hug us sometimes,
like he used to.

708
00:43:26,549 --> 00:43:29,262
That's not hard, not hard at all.

709
00:43:29,262 --> 00:43:33,214
And we can be together,
like we were with Mama.

710
00:43:33,214 --> 00:43:35,514
(knocking)

711
00:43:35,514 --> 00:43:37,097
- Ready for dinner?

712
00:43:39,578 --> 00:43:41,655
I must say, you look a lot cleaner

713
00:43:41,655 --> 00:43:44,207
than you did earlier.

714
00:43:44,207 --> 00:43:46,177
- They'll be down in a minute.

715
00:43:46,177 --> 00:43:49,094
I'd better get back to the kitchen.

716
00:43:52,108 --> 00:43:52,941
Sir.

717
00:43:57,102 --> 00:43:57,935
- Henry.

718
00:43:59,972 --> 00:44:01,805
Please, call me Henry.

719
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:12,806
- Dad.
- Yes?

720
00:44:12,806 --> 00:44:14,962
- You've got to believe
us, Laura's a witch.

721
00:44:14,962 --> 00:44:15,795
- Enough.

722
00:44:15,795 --> 00:44:18,276
I've had enough nonsense for one day.

723
00:44:18,276 --> 00:44:20,443
Now Laura is a fine woman.

724
00:44:23,414 --> 00:44:27,898
Look, let's just try to
have a nice dinner, okay?

725
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:29,648
Tommy, Ethel, please.

726
00:44:34,741 --> 00:44:36,908
- What are we going to do?

727
00:44:38,808 --> 00:44:41,808
(suspenseful music)

728
00:44:43,956 --> 00:44:44,789
- Laura?

729
00:44:44,789 --> 00:44:46,553
- Down here, darling.

730
00:44:46,553 --> 00:44:50,718
(tinkling)
(fizzing)

731
00:44:50,718 --> 00:44:51,551
Yuck.

732
00:44:55,017 --> 00:44:58,069
(bubbling)

733
00:44:58,069 --> 00:44:58,902
- Laura?

734
00:45:00,042 --> 00:45:01,292
- Yes, darling.

735
00:45:08,015 --> 00:45:10,932
(spitting)

736
00:45:10,932 --> 00:45:12,429
- Is everything okay?

737
00:45:12,429 --> 00:45:13,890
- Yes, yes, fine.

738
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:15,244
Brandy.

739
00:45:15,244 --> 00:45:17,986
- Yes, I think I could use one, thank you.

740
00:45:17,986 --> 00:45:18,819
Thank you.

741
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:22,841
Hmm.

742
00:45:22,841 --> 00:45:24,241
- Another headache?

743
00:45:24,241 --> 00:45:25,621
- Yes, I'm afraid so.

744
00:45:25,621 --> 00:45:26,454
- Let me.

745
00:45:28,742 --> 00:45:30,505
- This is very good.

746
00:45:30,505 --> 00:45:31,338
- Mmm.

747
00:45:34,771 --> 00:45:36,780
(moaning)

748
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,347
How are the little dears?

749
00:45:38,347 --> 00:45:39,393
All cleaned up?

750
00:45:39,393 --> 00:45:40,226
- Yes.

751
00:45:41,512 --> 00:45:42,861
- What is it?

752
00:45:42,861 --> 00:45:45,249
- It feels so much
better when you do this.

753
00:45:45,249 --> 00:45:46,545
I'm sorry about the kids.

754
00:45:46,545 --> 00:45:47,948
I don't know what's gotten into them.

755
00:45:47,948 --> 00:45:50,110
- Oh, well, they'll be perfectly all right

756
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:51,693
once we're married.

757
00:45:52,659 --> 00:45:56,263
We'll send them to good
schools, find a nanny.

758
00:45:56,263 --> 00:45:58,013
Don't worry, darling.

759
00:45:59,866 --> 00:46:02,424
- You look so lovely.

760
00:46:02,424 --> 00:46:04,507
- It's the drink talking.

761
00:46:06,103 --> 00:46:07,853
- No, not, I mean it.

762
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:10,870
You look beautiful.

763
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:13,787
- You say the nicest things, Henry.

764
00:46:14,743 --> 00:46:16,456
- You know, it's probably all my fault.

765
00:46:16,456 --> 00:46:18,609
If I was just to pay a little
bit more attention to them.

766
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:22,195
- Oh, for goodness sake, can
we forget about the children?

767
00:46:22,195 --> 00:46:23,554
Just for now, dear.

768
00:46:23,554 --> 00:46:24,387
- Okay.

769
00:46:26,302 --> 00:46:27,552
You're so kind.

770
00:46:30,169 --> 00:46:31,752
You're so generous.

771
00:46:32,637 --> 00:46:35,428
And you're so, so lovely.

772
00:46:35,428 --> 00:46:38,178
- Oh, let's not overdo it, Henry.

773
00:46:42,339 --> 00:46:43,422
Mm, children.

774
00:46:45,367 --> 00:46:47,034
- Oh, there you are.

775
00:46:48,004 --> 00:46:49,596
- Tommy and I would like to apologize

776
00:46:49,596 --> 00:46:51,081
for what happened today.

777
00:46:51,081 --> 00:46:53,861
May we please start again?

778
00:46:53,861 --> 00:46:55,611
- I, of course, dear.

779
00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:00,889
- Well, I must say, I'm proud of you.

780
00:47:00,889 --> 00:47:01,722
Yes, I am.

781
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:06,358
I'm proud of the both of you.

782
00:47:06,358 --> 00:47:09,091
Well, come, come, let's sit down.

783
00:47:09,091 --> 00:47:11,900
(eyes crackling)

784
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,483
Laura, you're here.

785
00:47:15,745 --> 00:47:19,578
Well, this is just like
one big, happy family.

786
00:47:21,036 --> 00:47:23,619
I think this calls for a toast.

787
00:47:26,554 --> 00:47:27,387
Don't you?

788
00:47:29,576 --> 00:47:31,743
To us, and to our futures.

789
00:47:33,478 --> 00:47:34,328
- To that.

790
00:47:34,328 --> 00:47:35,733
(clanking)
(shrieking)

791
00:47:35,733 --> 00:47:37,483
- What are you doing?

792
00:47:38,985 --> 00:47:40,566
Thomas!

793
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,066
Thomas, you idiot.

794
00:47:43,008 --> 00:47:44,446
(Laura crackling)

795
00:47:44,446 --> 00:47:47,224
(giggling)

796
00:47:47,224 --> 00:47:48,717
- It was an accident, Ms. Duvann.

797
00:47:48,717 --> 00:47:50,967
I'm sure he didn't mean it.

798
00:47:52,038 --> 00:47:53,955
- All right, thank you.

799
00:47:57,886 --> 00:47:58,803
Henry, sit.

800
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:02,815
Accidents happen.

801
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,271
Shall we eat?

802
00:48:04,271 --> 00:48:05,854
Thank you, Simpson.

803
00:48:11,823 --> 00:48:15,990
- Your father and I were
discussing where we should live.

804
00:48:16,968 --> 00:48:20,018
We thought here would be perfect.

805
00:48:20,018 --> 00:48:21,767
- But what about school?

806
00:48:21,767 --> 00:48:23,109
- What about our friends?

807
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:25,912
- We'll find both of you new ones,

808
00:48:25,912 --> 00:48:30,079
somewhere bracing and healthy
for you, Tommy. (laughing)

809
00:48:31,388 --> 00:48:34,471
And, a girls' college for you, Ethel.

810
00:48:35,368 --> 00:48:36,839
Won't that be nice?

811
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:39,856
- But we wanna be with Daddy.

812
00:48:39,856 --> 00:48:42,446
- Well, that's not gonna
be possible, darling.

813
00:48:42,446 --> 00:48:45,564
There are no schools around here.

814
00:48:45,564 --> 00:48:48,735
- We want to be with each other.

815
00:48:48,735 --> 00:48:49,972
- I don't know.

816
00:48:49,972 --> 00:48:53,319
All the best schools are
single-sex, you know.

817
00:48:53,319 --> 00:48:57,486
And we do want the best for
your darlings, don't we?

818
00:48:58,773 --> 00:49:02,702
- And you'll meet and
make new friends, darling.

819
00:49:02,702 --> 00:49:04,702
- It'll be an adventure.

820
00:49:09,933 --> 00:49:10,766
- Oh!

821
00:49:10,766 --> 00:49:14,587
(clattering)
(Laura screaming)

822
00:49:14,587 --> 00:49:16,869
(laughing)

823
00:49:16,869 --> 00:49:19,210
(crackling)

824
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:21,460
(smacking)

825
00:49:22,771 --> 00:49:23,604
- Henry!

826
00:49:24,468 --> 00:49:27,109
Sit down.
- Yes, dear.

827
00:49:27,109 --> 00:49:31,012
- If you carry on with
dinner, I shall rejoin you

828
00:49:31,012 --> 00:49:32,595
after I've changed.

829
00:49:35,882 --> 00:49:37,715
I hate vegetable soup.

830
00:49:39,535 --> 00:49:43,503
- Fiddlesticks. (giggling)

831
00:49:43,503 --> 00:49:44,336
- Yeah!

832
00:49:47,513 --> 00:49:50,096
(lively music)

833
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:09,452
- Just desert for me, I think, Simpson.

834
00:50:09,452 --> 00:50:10,964
Thank you, Mary.

835
00:50:10,964 --> 00:50:14,667
Ah, why don't you serve
Henry first, Simpson?

836
00:50:14,667 --> 00:50:16,110
He loves trifle.

837
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:17,825
- No he doesn't, he hates trifle.

838
00:50:17,825 --> 00:50:19,273
- No he doesn't.

839
00:50:19,273 --> 00:50:20,874
- Yes he does.

840
00:50:20,874 --> 00:50:22,794
- No, I, no I don't.

841
00:50:22,794 --> 00:50:23,961
I do, I don't.

842
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:31,057
Let's, I just don't like
it very much, that's all.

843
00:50:31,057 --> 00:50:34,807
- Ethel, you'll have
some, won't you darling?

844
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:46,209
I do love trifle.

845
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:52,921
Nevertheless, why don't you
serve Tommy first, Simpson?

846
00:50:54,933 --> 00:50:59,186
- [Ethel] Look out!
(splattering)

847
00:50:59,186 --> 00:51:01,805
- Thomas, you idiot!
(thudding)

848
00:51:01,805 --> 00:51:04,738
(Laura laughing)

849
00:51:04,738 --> 00:51:07,321
(lively music)

850
00:51:10,644 --> 00:51:13,144
- This isn't going to be easy.

851
00:51:16,341 --> 00:51:18,841
- She hasn't seen nothing yet.

852
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:23,327
(Tommy grunting)

853
00:51:26,301 --> 00:51:27,218
- Oh, yuck.

854
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:33,541
(energetic instrumental music)

855
00:51:33,541 --> 00:51:37,708
- Not with Fearless Finn
Regan McCool. (chuckling)

856
00:51:43,837 --> 00:51:45,596
(lights buzzing)

857
00:51:45,596 --> 00:51:47,417
(gasping)
- [Man] I got him!

858
00:51:47,417 --> 00:51:49,900
I got him, the lights are on him.

859
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,460
- Get after him.
- Cut him off!

860
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:53,366
- [Man] Spread out, go left, go that way.

861
00:51:53,366 --> 00:51:54,855
Oh, get out of my way.

862
00:51:54,855 --> 00:51:55,688
Don't let him pass.

863
00:51:55,688 --> 00:51:57,271
- You see anything?

864
00:51:58,373 --> 00:51:59,206
- No.

865
00:51:59,206 --> 00:52:00,738
There's no one here.

866
00:52:00,738 --> 00:52:02,574
Maybe it was a fox.
- Maybe.

867
00:52:02,574 --> 00:52:04,805
The photos will tell us for sure.

868
00:52:04,805 --> 00:52:08,444
Re-rig the wire, and check the cameras.

869
00:52:08,444 --> 00:52:10,895
- Take a look along the fence.

870
00:52:10,895 --> 00:52:12,145
- A leprechaun!

871
00:52:13,791 --> 00:52:16,089
Do you know what this means?

872
00:52:16,089 --> 00:52:16,922
Do you?

873
00:52:17,911 --> 00:52:18,744
Gold!

874
00:52:19,911 --> 00:52:21,763
It means gold!

875
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:23,738
Leprechaun gold.

876
00:52:23,738 --> 00:52:25,228
- I'm begging your pardon, Ma'am,

877
00:52:25,228 --> 00:52:28,419
and I know he's small and
all, but that's no leprechaun.

878
00:52:28,419 --> 00:52:30,597
There's no such thing.

879
00:52:30,597 --> 00:52:32,300
- Of course there's no such thing.

880
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,208
It's a joke.

881
00:52:33,208 --> 00:52:35,385
A joke, a joke, a joke, get it?

882
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:38,858
Whoever he is, he lives in the woods.

883
00:52:38,858 --> 00:52:40,422
Find him.

884
00:52:40,422 --> 00:52:41,847
I want him.

885
00:52:41,847 --> 00:52:43,708
- Yes, Ma'am.

886
00:52:43,708 --> 00:52:44,625
- Use dogs.

887
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:49,874
And hoses.

888
00:52:51,076 --> 00:52:51,909
- Hoses.

889
00:52:53,548 --> 00:52:54,478
Yes, Ma'am.

890
00:52:54,478 --> 00:52:56,728
(smacking)

891
00:52:59,982 --> 00:53:01,732
- Is something wrong?

892
00:53:02,873 --> 00:53:05,381
- Oh, quite the contrary.

893
00:53:05,381 --> 00:53:07,548
Everything's just perfect.

894
00:53:10,497 --> 00:53:13,085
Shall we greet our guests?

895
00:53:13,085 --> 00:53:14,085
- Of course.

896
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:25,216
(car doors slamming)

897
00:53:25,216 --> 00:53:26,803
- Sam.
- Hello Henry.

898
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:28,152
- So nice to see you.
- Pleasure.

899
00:53:28,152 --> 00:53:30,556
- My fiancee, Laura, Sam.
- How are you?

900
00:53:30,556 --> 00:53:32,398
- Shall we?
- What's going on?

901
00:53:32,398 --> 00:53:33,633
- I don't know.

902
00:53:33,633 --> 00:53:35,290
Let's go ask Mary.

903
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:37,315
- How are you?
- Hello there.

904
00:53:37,315 --> 00:53:41,617
(all speaking simultaneously)

905
00:53:41,617 --> 00:53:43,422
- Who are these people?

906
00:53:43,422 --> 00:53:46,365
- Oh, Ms. Duvann and your father
have a big meeting planned.

907
00:53:46,365 --> 00:53:47,325
- What about?

908
00:53:47,325 --> 00:53:48,408
- Lord knows.

909
00:53:49,798 --> 00:53:53,078
Come on, sit down, I'll
get you some breakfast.

910
00:53:53,078 --> 00:53:54,495
- Mary.
- Sir?

911
00:53:54,495 --> 00:53:56,319
- All the guests are here.

912
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:57,352
Good morning.
- Good mornin'.

913
00:53:57,352 --> 00:53:58,685
- You can serve.

914
00:54:03,033 --> 00:54:04,978
You can serve the coffee
whenever you're ready.

915
00:54:04,978 --> 00:54:05,811
- Yes sir.

916
00:54:09,644 --> 00:54:11,220
You know, you should be pleased

917
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:13,201
that your father's found someone.

918
00:54:13,201 --> 00:54:15,445
He deserves to be happy too, doesn't he?

919
00:54:15,445 --> 00:54:17,005
- No, you don't understand.

920
00:54:17,005 --> 00:54:18,111
- Try me.

921
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:20,421
- She doesn't make him happy.

922
00:54:20,421 --> 00:54:21,784
How can she?

923
00:54:21,784 --> 00:54:23,272
She's a wi--
- We,

924
00:54:23,272 --> 00:54:25,547
we never get to see Dad anymore

925
00:54:25,547 --> 00:54:27,243
because he's always with Laura.

926
00:54:27,243 --> 00:54:28,685
- Have you talked to him?

927
00:54:28,685 --> 00:54:30,074
- We tried.
- And?

928
00:54:30,074 --> 00:54:31,032
- Well...

929
00:54:31,032 --> 00:54:32,597
- He doesn't listen.

930
00:54:32,597 --> 00:54:33,764
No, it's true.

931
00:54:35,584 --> 00:54:38,946
And, it just got worse when Laura came in.

932
00:54:38,946 --> 00:54:41,540
Now he's being angry all the time,

933
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:43,403
and won't listen.

934
00:54:43,403 --> 00:54:47,236
- He gets all bad
headaches, and he gets mean.

935
00:54:48,382 --> 00:54:52,303
- Well, maybe I'll try and
persuade him to see a doctor, hm?

936
00:54:52,303 --> 00:54:53,309
- Thank you.

937
00:54:53,309 --> 00:54:54,142
- Okay.

938
00:54:55,009 --> 00:54:57,176
I'm not hungry, thank you.

939
00:54:58,246 --> 00:54:59,079
- Nor I.

940
00:55:02,819 --> 00:55:03,991
- Please.

941
00:55:03,991 --> 00:55:04,824
- Hello.

942
00:55:08,081 --> 00:55:09,619
Ah, thank you, my dear.

943
00:55:09,619 --> 00:55:11,523
- It's an interesting plan, Henry,

944
00:55:11,523 --> 00:55:13,511
and if anyone can afford it, you can.

945
00:55:13,511 --> 00:55:14,955
- Well, it's good for business, Sam,

946
00:55:14,955 --> 00:55:17,618
and if it's good for business,
it's good for Ireland.

947
00:55:17,618 --> 00:55:19,786
- I wonder what she wants with Dad.

948
00:55:19,786 --> 00:55:22,648
That's what I don't understand.

949
00:55:22,648 --> 00:55:23,623
- I don't know.

950
00:55:23,623 --> 00:55:25,873
What does any banshee want?

951
00:55:27,742 --> 00:55:29,419
Well, Dad has tons of money.

952
00:55:29,419 --> 00:55:31,370
- It's got to be more than that.

953
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:34,557
I wonder what they're doing downstairs.

954
00:55:34,557 --> 00:55:35,390
- Shhh.

955
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:39,365
(muffled voices speaking simultaneously)

956
00:55:39,365 --> 00:55:42,365
(suspenseful music)

957
00:55:48,972 --> 00:55:50,350
They're right below us.

958
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:51,183
- What?

959
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:57,096
(creaking)
(both gasping)

960
00:55:57,096 --> 00:55:59,158
- What'd you do?

961
00:55:59,158 --> 00:56:00,828
- I pressed a button.

962
00:56:00,828 --> 00:56:03,064
I guess it operates it.

963
00:56:03,064 --> 00:56:05,925
(sharp inhaling) I got an idea!

964
00:56:05,925 --> 00:56:07,839
- [Henry] Gentlemen, can I
have your attention please.

965
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:09,507
I think we all know one
another well enough,

966
00:56:09,507 --> 00:56:11,019
so I'll dispense with the formalities.

967
00:56:11,019 --> 00:56:12,333
- Come on.

968
00:56:12,333 --> 00:56:15,956
- And proceed directly
to the business at hand.

969
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:18,598
I know that the environmental
lobby is going to scream

970
00:56:18,598 --> 00:56:21,432
once they take a look at our proposal,

971
00:56:21,432 --> 00:56:23,789
but sometimes, gentlemen,
you have to break a few eggs

972
00:56:23,789 --> 00:56:26,943
to make a cake, or just starve.

973
00:56:26,943 --> 00:56:29,226
So let me assure you that Laura's proposal

974
00:56:29,226 --> 00:56:31,538
is for the benefit of everyone,

975
00:56:31,538 --> 00:56:34,335
everyone including the environment, Kim.

976
00:56:34,335 --> 00:56:36,117
There will be no expense spared

977
00:56:36,117 --> 00:56:38,366
looking out for the
welfare of the animals,

978
00:56:38,366 --> 00:56:40,448
our precious natural resources,

979
00:56:40,448 --> 00:56:42,020
that being the lake and the forest

980
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:43,750
and also for the surrounding villages.

981
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:45,153
- I can't see.
- Shh!

982
00:56:45,153 --> 00:56:46,545
- As you all know, the
cost of this project

983
00:56:46,545 --> 00:56:48,112
well exceeds government funding,

984
00:56:48,112 --> 00:56:51,705
so, I will personally
guarantee all expenses

985
00:56:51,705 --> 00:56:54,425
above and beyond the 20 million dollars

986
00:56:54,425 --> 00:56:55,672
that has been allocated.

987
00:56:55,672 --> 00:56:58,079
In other words, gentlemen,
Barridge Industries

988
00:56:58,079 --> 00:56:59,895
Will fill the shortfall.

989
00:56:59,895 --> 00:57:01,727
- Could we have that in writing?

990
00:57:01,727 --> 00:57:03,783
- If you look at your
brochure on page one, Kim,

991
00:57:03,783 --> 00:57:06,295
you'll see that I've already done so.

992
00:57:06,295 --> 00:57:08,441
- [Man] And what about the land?

993
00:57:08,441 --> 00:57:09,353
- The land?

994
00:57:09,353 --> 00:57:11,814
75% of the land required for this project

995
00:57:11,814 --> 00:57:13,892
is owned by Laura, and
has been in her family

996
00:57:13,892 --> 00:57:18,062
for generations, which she
so graciously has donated.

997
00:57:18,062 --> 00:57:20,312
(applause)

998
00:57:24,475 --> 00:57:26,027
- Thank you.

999
00:57:26,027 --> 00:57:27,694
- [Henry] Gentlemen.

1000
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:30,330
(children gasping)

1001
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:33,085
Laura's dream for Ireland's future.

1002
00:57:33,085 --> 00:57:35,109
- [Man] Oh, wonderful.

1003
00:57:35,109 --> 00:57:39,026
(all murmuring simultaneously)

1004
00:57:44,692 --> 00:57:46,284
- [Man] I think it's wonderful.

1005
00:57:46,284 --> 00:57:47,384
- Impressive.

1006
00:57:47,384 --> 00:57:49,384
- [Man] It certainly is.

1007
00:57:53,272 --> 00:57:56,649
- We're guaranteed to supply
power to half of Ireland

1008
00:57:56,649 --> 00:57:58,149
within five years.

1009
00:57:59,272 --> 00:58:01,189
Water power, gentlemen,

1010
00:58:02,486 --> 00:58:04,069
pure, clear, water.

1011
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:11,902
We're going to build a
huge wealth of power.

1012
00:58:16,088 --> 00:58:18,798
- [Man] What's going on here?

1013
00:58:18,798 --> 00:58:21,304
- Are you, are you okay?

1014
00:58:21,304 --> 00:58:23,971
- Sorry, yes, just enthusiastic.

1015
00:58:25,412 --> 00:58:26,451
- Of course.

1016
00:58:26,451 --> 00:58:29,060
- But you're floodin' this whole valley.

1017
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:31,069
There's no way you can
justify this environmentally,

1018
00:58:31,069 --> 00:58:33,080
Mr. Barridge, not even with all the weight

1019
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,941
you can throw behind it.

1020
00:58:34,941 --> 00:58:37,222
- Mr. Barridge has already justified it

1021
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:39,478
to all those who matter, Mr. Kim.

1022
00:58:39,478 --> 00:58:42,776
- Well to be perfectly
honest, I'm not happy.

1023
00:58:42,776 --> 00:58:46,512
- Well, to be perfectly
honest with you, Kim,

1024
00:58:46,512 --> 00:58:49,414
I don't care if a few deer get killed

1025
00:58:49,414 --> 00:58:51,573
or a few hundred rabbits
drown in their burrows

1026
00:58:51,573 --> 00:58:55,591
or we lose a few precious
acres of our endangered forest.

1027
00:58:55,591 --> 00:58:59,453
If we're ever to build an
industrial base in this country,

1028
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:03,148
we have to execute
these plans as they are.

1029
00:59:03,148 --> 00:59:04,731
We need--
- Come on.

1030
00:59:05,799 --> 00:59:07,276
- Where are you going?

1031
00:59:07,276 --> 00:59:08,109
- Come on.

1032
00:59:13,226 --> 00:59:16,393
- Besides, it's part of Laura's dream.

1033
00:59:18,323 --> 00:59:20,906
- I can't believe he said that.

1034
00:59:22,118 --> 00:59:25,817
It's her, she's making him, she must be.

1035
00:59:25,817 --> 00:59:28,163
She's evil, Ethel, Finn said so.

1036
00:59:28,163 --> 00:59:29,706
- We've got to warn him.

1037
00:59:29,706 --> 00:59:30,966
- No way.

1038
00:59:30,966 --> 00:59:32,061
- Tommy.

1039
00:59:32,061 --> 00:59:33,392
- He ran out on us.

1040
00:59:33,392 --> 00:59:35,326
- No he didn't, he was just invisible.

1041
00:59:35,326 --> 00:59:37,481
Who else tipped the flour in the barn?

1042
00:59:37,481 --> 00:59:39,472
Do you know how to fight a banshee?

1043
00:59:39,472 --> 00:59:40,684
Do you?

1044
00:59:40,684 --> 00:59:41,517
No.

1045
00:59:43,187 --> 00:59:44,564
Come on, then.

1046
00:59:44,564 --> 00:59:48,064
(passageway door banging)

1047
00:59:51,776 --> 00:59:54,776
(suspenseful music)

1048
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:02,949
Come on, quick.

1049
01:00:07,934 --> 01:00:09,485
Come on!
- But...

1050
01:00:09,485 --> 01:00:10,318
Ow!

1051
01:00:12,167 --> 01:00:13,190
Are you crazy?

1052
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:15,247
What if she comes?

1053
01:00:15,247 --> 01:00:16,233
- She won't.

1054
01:00:16,233 --> 01:00:17,467
- How do you know?

1055
01:00:17,467 --> 01:00:18,306
- I just do.

1056
01:00:18,306 --> 01:00:21,223
She's got other things on her mind.

1057
01:00:27,242 --> 01:00:29,927
Ice, no wonder it's so cold upstairs.

1058
01:00:29,927 --> 01:00:32,094
- Wow, what a weird place.

1059
01:00:33,206 --> 01:00:34,039
Scary.

1060
01:00:38,513 --> 01:00:39,346
Wow.

1061
01:00:40,438 --> 01:00:44,605
(bubbling)
(water trickling)

1062
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:50,079
(gasping)

1063
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:51,338
(screaming)

1064
01:00:51,338 --> 01:00:52,171
- Shh!

1065
01:00:52,171 --> 01:00:53,549
Let's get outta here.

1066
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:56,027
We've got to get out of
here before someone sees us.

1067
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:59,360
- [Tommy] Ethel, slow down, wait for me.

1068
01:01:00,889 --> 01:01:01,722
Wait!

1069
01:01:07,432 --> 01:01:08,265
- Come on.

1070
01:01:09,169 --> 01:01:10,002
- Wait.

1071
01:01:10,002 --> 01:01:11,244
- What?

1072
01:01:11,244 --> 01:01:12,661
- I have an idea.

1073
01:01:19,143 --> 01:01:20,893
- What are you doing?

1074
01:01:33,604 --> 01:01:34,861
Brilliant!

1075
01:01:34,861 --> 01:01:35,718
- Thanks.

1076
01:01:35,718 --> 01:01:36,551
- Come on.

1077
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:40,204
- Are you gonna boil that?

1078
01:01:40,204 --> 01:01:41,041
- I might.

1079
01:01:41,041 --> 01:01:42,603
- (laughs) I thought ya might.

1080
01:01:42,603 --> 01:01:45,191
(Mary laughing)

1081
01:01:45,191 --> 01:01:46,498
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1082
01:01:46,498 --> 01:01:47,665
- Ah, mornin'.

1083
01:01:52,266 --> 01:01:56,602
Pots and pots of money
doesn't buy love, I reckon.

1084
01:01:56,602 --> 01:02:00,269
Well, I can't sit here
admiring the scenery.

1085
01:02:01,697 --> 01:02:03,493
- I'm sorry, but you're
going to have to try

1086
01:02:03,493 --> 01:02:05,110
to use your imagination on this one.

1087
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:05,943
- Oh, I can't do that.

1088
01:02:05,943 --> 01:02:07,770
I understand exactly
what's happening here.

1089
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:10,770
I won't have anything to do with it.

1090
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:17,474
- She couldn't do this without you, Henry,

1091
01:02:17,474 --> 01:02:19,674
but I have to say, I'm surprised.

1092
01:02:19,674 --> 01:02:21,807
I don't know what sort of
spell she's put you under,

1093
01:02:21,807 --> 01:02:24,393
but I'm afraid I can't go
along with it, I'm sorry.

1094
01:02:24,393 --> 01:02:27,211
- Well I'm afraid you're
going to have to. (laughs)

1095
01:02:27,211 --> 01:02:30,343
I hold your markets. (laughing)

1096
01:02:30,343 --> 01:02:34,510
- You've changed, Henry
Barridge, and not for the better.

1097
01:02:36,139 --> 01:02:38,290
- Hmm.
- Hello, kitty cat.

1098
01:02:38,290 --> 01:02:39,956
(Laura laughing)

1099
01:02:39,956 --> 01:02:41,669
I think I hurt his feelings.

1100
01:02:41,669 --> 01:02:43,363
- Don't worry about it, darling.

1101
01:02:43,363 --> 01:02:44,942
He's not important.

1102
01:02:44,942 --> 01:02:47,499
I'm going to fix something
for that headache of yours

1103
01:02:47,499 --> 01:02:49,973
and you can get some rest
while I take care of business

1104
01:02:49,973 --> 01:02:51,337
down at the logging camp.

1105
01:02:51,337 --> 01:02:54,097
- Oh good, those drinks seem to help.

1106
01:02:54,097 --> 01:02:56,847
(engine humming)

1107
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:05,511
(somber instrumental music)

1108
01:03:08,936 --> 01:03:11,915
- This is going to be my best day ever!

1109
01:03:11,915 --> 01:03:13,457
Ahh!

1110
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:14,624
I can feel it.

1111
01:03:16,317 --> 01:03:17,150
Oh yes!

1112
01:03:21,384 --> 01:03:23,729
(dogs barking)

1113
01:03:23,729 --> 01:03:27,729
- Come on lads, come on lads.
- Move it up, Ben.

1114
01:03:29,232 --> 01:03:31,223
Find that lad.

1115
01:03:31,223 --> 01:03:32,056
- Finn!

1116
01:03:32,905 --> 01:03:33,738
- Finn!

1117
01:03:34,742 --> 01:03:36,581
- Where are you, Finn?

1118
01:03:36,581 --> 01:03:38,414
- Finn, where are you?

1119
01:03:39,585 --> 01:03:42,288
We have something important to say.

1120
01:03:42,288 --> 01:03:43,678
Finn!

1121
01:03:43,678 --> 01:03:45,106
- Shh.

1122
01:03:45,106 --> 01:03:47,430
- [Man] Keep going.

1123
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:48,832
Spread out.

1124
01:03:48,832 --> 01:03:49,999
Try that side.

1125
01:03:51,192 --> 01:03:52,639
- This way.

1126
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:56,806
(shouting drowned out by dogs barking)

1127
01:04:01,488 --> 01:04:03,727
- Faster, we must warn Finn.

1128
01:04:03,727 --> 01:04:05,060
- Keep together.

1129
01:04:06,699 --> 01:04:07,927
(thudding)
(grunting)

1130
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:09,970
- Tommy, are you all right?

1131
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:11,736
- [Tommy] Yes.

1132
01:04:11,736 --> 01:04:14,603
(sprayers hissing)

1133
01:04:14,603 --> 01:04:15,951
- [Man] Here, here.

1134
01:04:15,951 --> 01:04:17,034
Come on down.

1135
01:04:20,884 --> 01:04:23,614
- (gasping) They're hoses, Tommy.

1136
01:04:23,614 --> 01:04:25,877
They're looking for Finn, they must be!

1137
01:04:25,877 --> 01:04:28,027
We have to find him.

1138
01:04:28,027 --> 01:04:31,763
- But we don't know where he lives.

1139
01:04:31,763 --> 01:04:33,342
- Over there!
- There they are.

1140
01:04:33,342 --> 01:04:34,796
- Follow the kids.

1141
01:04:34,796 --> 01:04:37,277
(dogs barking)

1142
01:04:37,277 --> 01:04:39,656
(suspenseful music)

1143
01:04:39,656 --> 01:04:40,552
Quick!

1144
01:04:40,552 --> 01:04:42,552
Don't let them get away.

1145
01:04:44,632 --> 01:04:45,799
Run, everyone.

1146
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:55,959
(birds squawking)

1147
01:04:55,959 --> 01:04:57,459
Follow those kids.

1148
01:04:59,372 --> 01:05:00,606
Don't lose them!

1149
01:05:00,606 --> 01:05:02,856
(tinkling)

1150
01:05:04,628 --> 01:05:06,005
- Finn, Finn!

1151
01:05:06,005 --> 01:05:07,505
- This way, quick.

1152
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:12,466
- There they are!

1153
01:05:12,466 --> 01:05:13,299
Get them.

1154
01:05:14,775 --> 01:05:16,025
- Quick, quick.

1155
01:05:17,422 --> 01:05:19,195
What did you do, what did you do?

1156
01:05:19,195 --> 01:05:20,569
- We didn't do anything, Finn.

1157
01:05:20,569 --> 01:05:22,351
We came to warn you about the dam,

1158
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:25,094
but the men were in the forest with hoses.

1159
01:05:25,094 --> 01:05:27,663
She knows about ya, Finn, she
knows you're a leprechaun.

1160
01:05:27,663 --> 01:05:28,866
- Dam, what dam?

1161
01:05:28,866 --> 01:05:31,122
- She's building a dam to
flood the whole valley.

1162
01:05:31,122 --> 01:05:33,716
- (whimpering) What?

1163
01:05:33,716 --> 01:05:35,503
She wouldn't dare seek that much power.

1164
01:05:35,503 --> 01:05:36,493
- She's doing it.

1165
01:05:36,493 --> 01:05:38,618
- And Dad's helping her,
Fin, Dad's helping her.

1166
01:05:38,618 --> 01:05:40,087
- Of course he's helping again.

1167
01:05:40,087 --> 01:05:41,346
Stronger men than your father

1168
01:05:41,346 --> 01:05:43,453
have fallen under the banshee spell.

1169
01:05:43,453 --> 01:05:45,060
- What should we do?

1170
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:47,624
- We'll have to hope he loves you enough.

1171
01:05:47,624 --> 01:05:49,776
- But he doesn't love us, he loves her.

1172
01:05:49,776 --> 01:05:52,373
- Quick!
- Down this way.

1173
01:05:52,373 --> 01:05:53,540
- [Man] Hurry!

1174
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:56,534
- You've got to get out of here.

1175
01:05:56,534 --> 01:05:58,935
- No, noo.
- What do you need?

1176
01:05:58,935 --> 01:06:00,551
- What is this?
- Over here!

1177
01:06:00,551 --> 01:06:02,434
- Must be inside.
- They're here!

1178
01:06:02,434 --> 01:06:03,975
(banging)

1179
01:06:03,975 --> 01:06:05,209
Open up.
- Shoot.

1180
01:06:05,209 --> 01:06:07,173
It's too late, they're here.

1181
01:06:07,173 --> 01:06:08,653
- Do you have a back door?

1182
01:06:08,653 --> 01:06:09,804
- Well...

1183
01:06:09,804 --> 01:06:11,711
- Break it down.
- Okay, where is it?

1184
01:06:11,711 --> 01:06:12,544
Come on!

1185
01:06:12,544 --> 01:06:13,960
- This way, back door, this way.

1186
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:15,210
- Quick, hurry.

1187
01:06:16,698 --> 01:06:19,198
- Quick, quick, down the hole.

1188
01:06:24,101 --> 01:06:26,101
Me gold, I need me gold.

1189
01:06:28,002 --> 01:06:30,669
- It's too late, go, keep going.

1190
01:06:35,705 --> 01:06:37,136
- [Ethel] Come on!

1191
01:06:37,136 --> 01:06:39,617
- Where is the little rat?
- Look under the bed.

1192
01:06:39,617 --> 01:06:40,973
- [Man] There's gotta be a back door.

1193
01:06:40,973 --> 01:06:42,962
Somebody go around the back.

1194
01:06:42,962 --> 01:06:44,465
There's nothing under the bed.

1195
01:06:44,465 --> 01:06:47,534
- Just keep looking.
- Keep looking.

1196
01:06:47,534 --> 01:06:50,534
(children grunting)

1197
01:06:52,067 --> 01:06:54,817
- Mm, the golden goose has flown.

1198
01:06:55,752 --> 01:06:56,835
What a shame.

1199
01:06:58,592 --> 01:07:00,925
- I think I found something.

1200
01:07:02,189 --> 01:07:04,107
(tinkling)

1201
01:07:04,107 --> 01:07:05,524
- Leave it alone.

1202
01:07:07,175 --> 01:07:08,592
The gold is mine.

1203
01:07:21,126 --> 01:07:23,959
(Laura squealing)

1204
01:07:25,812 --> 01:07:28,145
(crackling)

1205
01:07:32,808 --> 01:07:35,788
(Laura shrieking)

1206
01:07:35,788 --> 01:07:36,955
Give it to me.

1207
01:07:39,164 --> 01:07:39,997
Now!

1208
01:07:44,499 --> 01:07:46,832
Do you give it to me freely?

1209
01:07:49,221 --> 01:07:50,054
- Yes.

1210
01:07:55,941 --> 01:07:57,108
- [Laura] Yes!

1211
01:07:58,173 --> 01:08:01,840
(lively instrumental music)

1212
01:08:06,233 --> 01:08:07,965
- Oh, what?

1213
01:08:07,965 --> 01:08:09,882
- I'm stuck, I'm stuck.

1214
01:08:11,425 --> 01:08:12,549
- Hurry up!

1215
01:08:12,549 --> 01:08:14,799
(grunting)

1216
01:08:17,898 --> 01:08:19,060
- You're too fat.

1217
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:20,036
- I'm not too fat.

1218
01:08:20,036 --> 01:08:22,349
I'm too poor, she's taken all me gold.

1219
01:08:22,349 --> 01:08:23,599
Now help me up.

1220
01:08:25,931 --> 01:08:28,309
(groaning)

1221
01:08:28,309 --> 01:08:30,453
- She's got your gold?

1222
01:08:30,453 --> 01:08:31,686
Oh no.

1223
01:08:31,686 --> 01:08:33,213
- Oh no!

1224
01:08:33,213 --> 01:08:35,963
- So, how long before you, splat?

1225
01:08:37,328 --> 01:08:39,365
No, I mean, pop.

1226
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:40,623
- I don't know.

1227
01:08:40,623 --> 01:08:41,766
- You don't know?

1228
01:08:41,766 --> 01:08:43,233
- Well it's never happened to me before.

1229
01:08:43,233 --> 01:08:44,557
I don't know.

1230
01:08:44,557 --> 01:08:47,640
- So, how much gold do you have left?

1231
01:08:49,979 --> 01:08:52,745
- Not much. (whimpering)

1232
01:08:52,745 --> 01:08:53,578
- Finn!

1233
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:56,453
- Oh, oh Finn.

1234
01:08:56,453 --> 01:08:58,093
- Yes.

1235
01:08:58,093 --> 01:08:58,926
Power.

1236
01:08:59,893 --> 01:09:00,810
Real power.

1237
01:09:02,955 --> 01:09:03,955
Earth power!

1238
01:09:05,587 --> 01:09:06,420
Yes!

1239
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:11,207
- There's a gold in the
dairy, for the milk.

1240
01:09:11,207 --> 01:09:12,788
I leave it, but hide it.

1241
01:09:12,788 --> 01:09:14,246
Maybe they haven't found it.

1242
01:09:14,246 --> 01:09:15,937
- You leave it, but you hide it?

1243
01:09:15,937 --> 01:09:16,990
You pay, but you don't?

1244
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:18,752
- Would you be after
making a fine point of it?

1245
01:09:18,752 --> 01:09:21,035
Are you going to help me, boy?

1246
01:09:21,035 --> 01:09:22,216
- [Man] I can see daylight.

1247
01:09:22,216 --> 01:09:23,782
(children gasping)
- Quick!

1248
01:09:23,782 --> 01:09:25,489
You can find Finn's gold from the dairy.

1249
01:09:25,489 --> 01:09:27,322
We'll go find Dad, go!

1250
01:09:29,008 --> 01:09:30,531
Hurry Finn, that way.

1251
01:09:30,531 --> 01:09:31,781
Quick, come on!

1252
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:35,733
- Wait, wait, wait.

1253
01:09:41,159 --> 01:09:42,159
- I'm stuck.

1254
01:09:43,523 --> 01:09:44,356
Hey, help!

1255
01:09:45,815 --> 01:09:46,648
I'm stuck.

1256
01:09:48,128 --> 01:09:52,295
(chickens squawking)
(cows mooing)

1257
01:09:56,450 --> 01:09:57,700
- Go on, go on.

1258
01:10:01,092 --> 01:10:03,425
(tinkling)

1259
01:10:05,222 --> 01:10:06,055
- Men.

1260
01:10:08,226 --> 01:10:11,726
(soft instrumental music)

1261
01:10:35,434 --> 01:10:37,184
- Tricky old cobbler.

1262
01:10:47,238 --> 01:10:50,519
(clattering)
(gasping)

1263
01:10:50,519 --> 01:10:51,352
The cows.

1264
01:11:08,745 --> 01:11:09,578
Darn it.

1265
01:11:14,782 --> 01:11:17,449
- Are you looking for somethin'?

1266
01:11:20,031 --> 01:11:21,457
- [Mary] Well if you won't listen to me,

1267
01:11:21,457 --> 01:11:22,958
see a doctor about those headaches.

1268
01:11:22,958 --> 01:11:24,789
- I don't need your
advice about my headaches.

1269
01:11:24,789 --> 01:11:26,342
- I am talking about your children,

1270
01:11:26,342 --> 01:11:27,554
you're breaking their hearts--

1271
01:11:27,554 --> 01:11:29,916
- And I certainly don't need
your advice about my children.

1272
01:11:29,916 --> 01:11:31,052
- You're unbelievable.

1273
01:11:31,052 --> 01:11:32,727
- Whatever it is, they will get over it.

1274
01:11:32,727 --> 01:11:34,424
- Oh will they, now?

1275
01:11:34,424 --> 01:11:38,501
- Besides, who are you to give me advice?

1276
01:11:38,501 --> 01:11:39,869
You are nothing.

1277
01:11:39,869 --> 01:11:43,710
You are a nobody, you are
nothing but common hired help,

1278
01:11:43,710 --> 01:11:46,877
and you...
(smacking)

1279
01:11:49,423 --> 01:11:50,846
I'm sorry.

1280
01:11:50,846 --> 01:11:52,679
- Just leave me alone.

1281
01:11:54,391 --> 01:11:56,474
- Mary, I'm really sorry.

1282
01:11:58,330 --> 01:11:59,247
I am sorry.

1283
01:12:00,269 --> 01:12:03,936
(somber instrumental music)

1284
01:12:05,897 --> 01:12:07,580
(tinkling)

1285
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:09,830
(grunting)

1286
01:12:11,705 --> 01:12:13,455
- Get down, get down.

1287
01:12:15,753 --> 01:12:17,364
- I don't know who I am anymore,

1288
01:12:17,364 --> 01:12:19,399
I don't know what I'm saying.

1289
01:12:19,399 --> 01:12:20,732
- You need help.

1290
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:24,933
- I didn't mean what I said, Mary.

1291
01:12:26,005 --> 01:12:28,255
I love, I love my children.

1292
01:12:29,305 --> 01:12:33,536
I love them so much
that sometimes it hurts.

1293
01:12:33,536 --> 01:12:35,559
I don't wanna lose them.

1294
01:12:35,559 --> 01:12:37,059
- Well, tell them.

1295
01:12:38,769 --> 01:12:40,842
Work it out between them and Ms. Duvann.

1296
01:12:40,842 --> 01:12:42,842
- They won't understand.

1297
01:12:46,342 --> 01:12:48,131
They won't understand.

1298
01:12:48,131 --> 01:12:50,529
- Well make them understand.

1299
01:12:50,529 --> 01:12:53,862
Just, just tell them that you love them.

1300
01:12:55,507 --> 01:12:56,674
Ethel.
- Ethel?

1301
01:12:59,697 --> 01:13:02,881
Ethel is not even her real name, you know.

1302
01:13:02,881 --> 01:13:07,026
Emma is her given name, but
her mom called her Ethel

1303
01:13:07,026 --> 01:13:09,496
even before she was born.

1304
01:13:09,496 --> 01:13:10,913
I never knew why.

1305
01:13:12,818 --> 01:13:15,689
And after her mom passed away, well,

1306
01:13:15,689 --> 01:13:17,356
it just kinda stuck.

1307
01:13:19,024 --> 01:13:22,465
(footsteps clacking)

1308
01:13:22,465 --> 01:13:23,981
- [Laura] Mary,

1309
01:13:23,981 --> 01:13:25,118
and Henry.

1310
01:13:25,118 --> 01:13:28,451
- Laura, we need to talk about the kids.

1311
01:13:32,072 --> 01:13:34,044
- The kids?
- Yeah.

1312
01:13:34,044 --> 01:13:35,847
- Mm, not now, darling.

1313
01:13:35,847 --> 01:13:37,484
Simply golden opportunity.

1314
01:13:37,484 --> 01:13:39,984
- No, now is a very good time.

1315
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:42,041
- I see.

1316
01:13:43,284 --> 01:13:45,784
I feel a conspiracy coming on.

1317
01:13:46,963 --> 01:13:48,443
- Don't be ridiculous.

1318
01:13:48,443 --> 01:13:51,610
- (laughing) Simpson!

1319
01:13:53,072 --> 01:13:56,020
Well, I can see what he
sees in you, darling.

1320
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:59,588
I think, but what on
earth do you see in him?

1321
01:13:59,588 --> 01:14:00,918
- What do you mean?

1322
01:14:00,918 --> 01:14:04,260
- Well, it takes love
to break a spell, dear.

1323
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:08,403
Silly me, I never dreamed
you'd fall for him.

1324
01:14:08,403 --> 01:14:09,312
- I haven't.

1325
01:14:09,312 --> 01:14:10,979
- We haven't, and I,

1326
01:14:13,193 --> 01:14:15,579
I love my children very much,

1327
01:14:15,579 --> 01:14:18,106
and at the moment they're very unhappy

1328
01:14:18,106 --> 01:14:20,636
and if this thing between
us is to work out,

1329
01:14:20,636 --> 01:14:22,469
they have to be happy.

1330
01:14:23,634 --> 01:14:27,661
- Yes, well, why don't I
mix us all a little drink?

1331
01:14:27,661 --> 01:14:30,020
- I don't need a drink, Laura.

1332
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:31,736
I don't want a drink.

1333
01:14:31,736 --> 01:14:34,045
What I want to do is to talk.

1334
01:14:34,045 --> 01:14:34,962
- You want?

1335
01:14:36,576 --> 01:14:37,409
You want?

1336
01:14:38,571 --> 01:14:40,821
I don't care what you want.

1337
01:14:42,704 --> 01:14:45,787
I don't need you anymore, Henry dear.

1338
01:14:47,882 --> 01:14:51,715
I don't need any man
anymore, or your science.

1339
01:14:53,023 --> 01:14:54,804
- [Henry] I should have
trusted my children.

1340
01:14:54,804 --> 01:14:56,045
You are a witch.

1341
01:14:56,045 --> 01:14:59,712
- Yes, but I have the
gold, leprechaun gold.

1342
01:15:00,874 --> 01:15:02,645
Nothing any immortal can do

1343
01:15:02,645 --> 01:15:05,505
can make the slightest
bit of difference anymore.

1344
01:15:05,505 --> 01:15:08,172
I am going to flood this valley!

1345
01:15:09,559 --> 01:15:11,325
- Not if I can help it.

1346
01:15:11,325 --> 01:15:12,869
- Watch me!

1347
01:15:12,869 --> 01:15:17,036
(crackling)
(rumbling)

1348
01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:20,613
- No, no, no!

1349
01:15:22,490 --> 01:15:23,573
No, no, nooo!

1350
01:15:31,676 --> 01:15:34,343
- I am the spirit of the rivers,

1351
01:15:36,833 --> 01:15:40,083
and the ocean, the storm, and the seas.

1352
01:15:42,606 --> 01:15:43,523
I am power!

1353
01:15:49,321 --> 01:15:52,154
(water trickling)

1354
01:15:54,163 --> 01:15:56,496
(sploshing)

1355
01:15:59,568 --> 01:16:01,735
Find those wretched brats!

1356
01:16:15,866 --> 01:16:16,912
- What?

1357
01:16:16,912 --> 01:16:19,196
- She melted my dad.

1358
01:16:19,196 --> 01:16:20,029
- Oh no!

1359
01:16:21,418 --> 01:16:23,668
(grunting)

1360
01:16:40,191 --> 01:16:42,116
(Laura grunting)

1361
01:16:42,116 --> 01:16:44,866
(door squeaking)

1362
01:16:52,209 --> 01:16:53,784
- It's not much, mind ya.

1363
01:16:53,784 --> 01:16:55,292
Just what me and me dad and his dad

1364
01:16:55,292 --> 01:16:58,104
and the dad before that could keep.

1365
01:16:58,104 --> 01:17:00,805
Here.
(tinkling)

1366
01:17:00,805 --> 01:17:01,638
- Ned!

1367
01:17:01,638 --> 01:17:04,149
- Well, what do we do
with leprechaun gold?

1368
01:17:04,149 --> 01:17:04,982
Here.

1369
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:07,359
- Finn will make it up to you, Ned.

1370
01:17:07,359 --> 01:17:10,410
- Oh no, I'll have no
leprechaun beholden to me,

1371
01:17:10,410 --> 01:17:12,873
and I'll not be beholden
to any leprechaun.

1372
01:17:12,873 --> 01:17:14,910
Not on your life, (shivers)

1373
01:17:14,910 --> 01:17:16,597
crafty little devils.

1374
01:17:16,597 --> 01:17:17,764
Mark my words.

1375
01:17:23,519 --> 01:17:24,892
- Ahh!
- Gotcha.

1376
01:17:24,892 --> 01:17:25,725
Again.

1377
01:17:27,473 --> 01:17:29,441
- Let me go, let me go!

1378
01:17:29,441 --> 01:17:32,441
(suspenseful music)

1379
01:17:34,807 --> 01:17:38,077
(gold tinkling)

1380
01:17:38,077 --> 01:17:39,327
- Come on down.

1381
01:17:42,128 --> 01:17:44,378
(whacking)

1382
01:17:50,605 --> 01:17:52,855
(groaning)

1383
01:18:00,388 --> 01:18:02,931
Then I'll come up to you.

1384
01:18:02,931 --> 01:18:05,598
(gold tinkling)

1385
01:18:23,913 --> 01:18:25,663
Give me the bag, sir.

1386
01:18:28,897 --> 01:18:30,655
(shovel clanking)
Thank you.

1387
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:32,687
- Ahhh!
(Simpson groaning)

1388
01:18:32,687 --> 01:18:34,937
(crashing)

1389
01:18:56,829 --> 01:18:59,496
(gold tinkling)

1390
01:19:02,423 --> 01:19:03,288
- Mm hmm.

1391
01:19:03,288 --> 01:19:06,654
- I don't think we should be doing this.

1392
01:19:06,654 --> 01:19:08,763
- She melted my dad.

1393
01:19:08,763 --> 01:19:11,596
(Finn whimpering)

1394
01:19:13,817 --> 01:19:16,658
(bubbling)

1395
01:19:16,658 --> 01:19:18,991
(crackling)

1396
01:19:23,812 --> 01:19:24,979
Come on, Finn.

1397
01:19:34,241 --> 01:19:35,491
He's all right!

1398
01:19:44,862 --> 01:19:46,916
- I don't know what you are,

1399
01:19:46,916 --> 01:19:48,433
but I am going to stop you,

1400
01:19:48,433 --> 01:19:51,853
and you are not going to hurt my kids.

1401
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:53,887
(laughing)

1402
01:19:53,887 --> 01:19:56,137
- Oh, the arrogance of man.

1403
01:19:58,077 --> 01:20:01,414
A thousand years I have watched you

1404
01:20:01,414 --> 01:20:02,997
destroy this world.

1405
01:20:05,916 --> 01:20:09,490
We all had a place
once, even those like me

1406
01:20:09,490 --> 01:20:12,407
who like cold, dark, swampy places.

1407
01:20:14,346 --> 01:20:16,596
But you had to have it all.

1408
01:20:18,715 --> 01:20:22,132
You drained the swamps, cut down forests,

1409
01:20:23,211 --> 01:20:25,652
polluted the lakes and the rivers

1410
01:20:25,652 --> 01:20:29,025
and expect the world and everything in it

1411
01:20:29,025 --> 01:20:33,108
to settle to your needs,
as if only you mattered.

1412
01:20:36,021 --> 01:20:38,271
I will restore the balance.

1413
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,804
(Laura gasping)
- Run!

1414
01:20:42,804 --> 01:20:44,941
(Laura screaming)

1415
01:20:44,941 --> 01:20:49,108
(whooshing)
(booming)

1416
01:20:51,474 --> 01:20:53,170
Ethel, get back!
- Daddy!

1417
01:20:53,170 --> 01:20:56,869
(screaming)
(exploding)

1418
01:20:56,869 --> 01:20:59,633
(dramatic music)

1419
01:20:59,633 --> 01:21:02,242
(crackling)

1420
01:21:02,242 --> 01:21:04,492
(crashing)

1421
01:21:05,405 --> 01:21:07,876
No, leave him alone!
- Ethel, Ethel.

1422
01:21:07,876 --> 01:21:09,388
- Come back!

1423
01:21:09,388 --> 01:21:10,301
Look out!

1424
01:21:10,301 --> 01:21:14,468
(booming)
(shrieking)

1425
01:21:16,568 --> 01:21:17,401
- Daddy!

1426
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:22,458
(crackling)
(groaning)

1427
01:21:25,373 --> 01:21:26,790
- Ethel, get out!

1428
01:21:28,495 --> 01:21:31,328
- Help him, Finn!
- Help him, Finn.

1429
01:21:34,391 --> 01:21:36,856
But I have his gold.

1430
01:21:36,856 --> 01:21:39,356
See how weak he grows already?

1431
01:21:41,294 --> 01:21:43,850
The leprechaun can't hurt me.

1432
01:21:43,850 --> 01:21:45,183
He has no power.

1433
01:21:46,303 --> 01:21:47,303
Not anymore.

1434
01:21:49,079 --> 01:21:50,439
- I'm so sorry.

1435
01:21:50,439 --> 01:21:53,189
- Awww. (laughs)

1436
01:21:54,738 --> 01:21:57,821
See, see what I can do with his gold?

1437
01:21:59,944 --> 01:22:02,194
(cackling)

1438
01:22:03,603 --> 01:22:04,436
- Nooo!

1439
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:08,067
(booming)

1440
01:22:10,903 --> 01:22:13,653
(dramatic music)

1441
01:22:21,985 --> 01:22:22,818
- Stop!

1442
01:22:24,618 --> 01:22:26,285
- You spoke, my pet?

1443
01:22:28,682 --> 01:22:30,659
You have a gift for me?

1444
01:22:30,659 --> 01:22:33,461
- I didn't give you form
to destroy the world.

1445
01:22:33,461 --> 01:22:35,895
I want to rule it as it is.

1446
01:22:35,895 --> 01:22:37,529
- You do?

1447
01:22:37,529 --> 01:22:39,626
- I have gold now.

1448
01:22:39,626 --> 01:22:42,834
I have power to add to my magic.

1449
01:22:42,834 --> 01:22:45,468
You will do exactly as I say.

1450
01:22:45,468 --> 01:22:46,857
- You're not strong enough.

1451
01:22:46,857 --> 01:22:48,344
Don't do this.

1452
01:22:48,344 --> 01:22:49,261
- Be quiet.

1453
01:22:51,926 --> 01:22:53,565
You,

1454
01:22:53,565 --> 01:22:55,482
banshee, on your knees.

1455
01:22:59,001 --> 01:23:00,168
On your knees.

1456
01:23:01,812 --> 01:23:04,812
(suspenseful music)

1457
01:23:10,367 --> 01:23:13,034
(gold tinkling)

1458
01:23:29,288 --> 01:23:31,621
(whooshing)

1459
01:23:42,022 --> 01:23:44,355
(screaming)

1460
01:23:59,339 --> 01:24:03,506
(crackling)
(whooshing)

1461
01:24:10,668 --> 01:24:13,548
(Simpson yelling)

1462
01:24:13,548 --> 01:24:15,881
(shrieking)

1463
01:24:25,659 --> 01:24:27,992
(exploding)

1464
01:24:28,870 --> 01:24:30,979
(screaming)

1465
01:24:30,979 --> 01:24:35,448
(crashing)
- [Finn] Look out!

1466
01:24:35,448 --> 01:24:37,059
(gold tinkling)

1467
01:24:37,059 --> 01:24:38,655
- Tommy.

1468
01:24:38,655 --> 01:24:40,194
Tommy, come here.

1469
01:24:40,194 --> 01:24:41,027
- Oh no.

1470
01:24:42,155 --> 01:24:44,859
- Come to Laura, Tommy dear.

1471
01:24:44,859 --> 01:24:46,378
- Leave him alone.

1472
01:24:46,378 --> 01:24:48,378
- Oh, do shut up, Henry.

1473
01:24:49,315 --> 01:24:51,015
Give me the gold.

1474
01:24:51,015 --> 01:24:52,347
- Dad!

1475
01:24:52,347 --> 01:24:54,711
- Tommy, I can't help you.

1476
01:24:54,711 --> 01:24:56,139
You give it to the little man.

1477
01:24:56,139 --> 01:24:57,538
- Stop with these childish games.

1478
01:24:57,538 --> 01:24:58,962
Give me the gold.

1479
01:24:58,962 --> 01:25:00,605
- Give her the gold.

1480
01:25:00,605 --> 01:25:02,110
- But you could destroy her.

1481
01:25:02,110 --> 01:25:04,770
- I only have the power
of life, son, not death.

1482
01:25:04,770 --> 01:25:06,598
- But we'll all die, you'll die.

1483
01:25:06,598 --> 01:25:07,796
- You did your best.

1484
01:25:07,796 --> 01:25:08,976
Now give her the gold.

1485
01:25:08,976 --> 01:25:11,799
- Listen, Tommy.
- A gift to you, banshee.

1486
01:25:11,799 --> 01:25:14,533
(shrieking)

1487
01:25:14,533 --> 01:25:17,283
(Laura laughing)

1488
01:25:19,349 --> 01:25:21,593
(whooshing)

1489
01:25:21,593 --> 01:25:23,343
- With all this gold,

1490
01:25:24,457 --> 01:25:27,874
I will make this world a fit place again,

1491
01:25:29,741 --> 01:25:32,869
and the old ones will come back.

1492
01:25:32,869 --> 01:25:34,617
Now it's mine.

1493
01:25:34,617 --> 01:25:37,048
- The old ones are dead, banshee.

1494
01:25:37,048 --> 01:25:38,200
We are alone.

1495
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:39,033
- Noooo!

1496
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:46,240
(Finn groaning)

1497
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:49,441
- Doesn't matter what you
do, they won't come back.

1498
01:25:49,441 --> 01:25:53,633
- Then I will take revenge in their name.

1499
01:25:53,633 --> 01:25:55,800
I will destroy this world.

1500
01:25:58,373 --> 01:26:02,540
(booming)
(Laura wailing)

1501
01:26:10,285 --> 01:26:13,410
(Finn whimpering)

1502
01:26:13,410 --> 01:26:16,982
(dramatic music)

1503
01:26:16,982 --> 01:26:20,315
- Get out of here!
- I will take revenge.

1504
01:26:21,155 --> 01:26:24,488
What I cannot have back, I will destroy.

1505
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:30,777
(crackling)
(rumbling)

1506
01:26:30,777 --> 01:26:32,694
- Get the children out.

1507
01:26:34,772 --> 01:26:37,022
(thudding)

1508
01:26:38,253 --> 01:26:39,670
- Run, everybody!

1509
01:26:42,353 --> 01:26:44,520
(booming)

1510
01:26:52,067 --> 01:26:53,693
Be careful!

1511
01:26:53,693 --> 01:26:56,026
(screaming)

1512
01:27:17,764 --> 01:27:20,514
(ice shattering)

1513
01:27:23,179 --> 01:27:25,594
(exploding)

1514
01:27:25,594 --> 01:27:27,844
(tinkling)

1515
01:27:31,452 --> 01:27:33,785
(crackling)

1516
01:27:44,461 --> 01:27:45,828
- Finn!
- Tommy.

1517
01:27:45,828 --> 01:27:46,661
- Finn!

1518
01:27:48,446 --> 01:27:50,129
(gold tinkling)

1519
01:27:50,129 --> 01:27:52,734
Finn, I'm coming, Finn.

1520
01:27:52,734 --> 01:27:56,192
- I'm coming, Finn!
- Ethel, Ethel come back.

1521
01:27:56,192 --> 01:27:59,110
- Finn, take it, Finn, take it.

1522
01:27:59,110 --> 01:28:01,106
Please don't die.

1523
01:28:01,106 --> 01:28:03,023
Oh gosh, come on, Finn.

1524
01:28:03,968 --> 01:28:04,801
Take it.

1525
01:28:05,668 --> 01:28:06,501
Try.

1526
01:28:07,929 --> 01:28:10,596
(Finn grunting)

1527
01:28:11,502 --> 01:28:14,404
(gold tinkling)

1528
01:28:14,404 --> 01:28:17,904
(soft instrumental music)

1529
01:28:45,238 --> 01:28:46,488
- [Ethel] Finn!

1530
01:28:50,039 --> 01:28:52,631
- Sorry, but you're crushing me.

1531
01:28:52,631 --> 01:28:54,290
- You destroyed her.

1532
01:28:54,290 --> 01:28:55,872
- You said your power is life.

1533
01:28:55,872 --> 01:28:56,705
- It is.

1534
01:28:56,705 --> 01:28:59,188
We are what nature makes us human.

1535
01:28:59,188 --> 01:29:00,788
The gift of so much gold,

1536
01:29:00,788 --> 01:29:03,183
it made her into something
other than what she was.

1537
01:29:03,183 --> 01:29:05,431
In the end, she destroyed herself.

1538
01:29:05,431 --> 01:29:08,059
- But you gave up your
gold to save our lives.

1539
01:29:08,059 --> 01:29:09,892
- You gave it me back.

1540
01:29:12,342 --> 01:29:15,575
- Children, do you know that I love you?

1541
01:29:15,575 --> 01:29:17,641
The both of you?

1542
01:29:17,641 --> 01:29:19,931
- I love you too, Daddy.

1543
01:29:19,931 --> 01:29:20,764
- Ahhh.

1544
01:29:23,045 --> 01:29:26,058
You saved our lives, how
could we ever repay you?

1545
01:29:26,058 --> 01:29:27,764
- You can stop them flooding me valley.

1546
01:29:27,764 --> 01:29:29,364
- Done.

1547
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:30,990
(grunting)

1548
01:29:30,990 --> 01:29:32,928
Is there anything else?
(laughing)

1549
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:34,838
- You can forget I ever existed.

1550
01:29:34,838 --> 01:29:36,968
(laughing)

1551
01:29:36,968 --> 01:29:38,726
- Don't say it, Finn.

1552
01:29:38,726 --> 01:29:40,750
- [Tommy And Ethel] You hate being wet.

1553
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:41,994
(laughing)

1554
01:29:41,994 --> 01:29:42,827
- Come on.

1555
01:29:46,567 --> 01:29:49,317
(Finn chuckling)

1556
01:29:51,998 --> 01:29:53,937
- [Finn] It wasn't very fun being a giant.

1557
01:29:53,937 --> 01:29:55,260
I almost popped.

1558
01:29:55,260 --> 01:29:59,507
Imagine that, one
gigantic splat. (chuckles)

1559
01:29:59,507 --> 01:30:03,674
(speech drowned out by instrumental music)

1560
01:30:06,429 --> 01:30:09,262
(water trickling)

1561
01:30:25,974 --> 01:30:29,641
(lively instrumental music)

1562
01:33:28,722 --> 01:33:31,639
(MultiCom Jingle)
