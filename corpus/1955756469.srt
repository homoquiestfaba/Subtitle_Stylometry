00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:05,838
<i>...this is a busy time.</i>

2
00:00:05,838 --> 00:00:08,838
<i> So, if you wanna shop...</i>

3
00:00:05,838 --> 00:00:08,307
<i>Maybe a pedicure.</i>

4
00:00:08,307 --> 00:00:10,409
<i>A pedicure?</i>

5
00:00:10,409 --> 00:00:12,845
<i> Okay, that's where
we draw the line. That's it.</i>

6
00:00:12,845 --> 00:00:15,114
<i> But in any event,
go to today.com</i>

7
00:00:15,114 --> 00:00:17,116
<i> for all the rules
and regulations</i>

8
00:00:17,116 --> 00:00:19,618
<i> and what you need to do,
'cause I'd love to come</i>

9
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:22,455
<i> and wake up with you.
All right.</i>

10
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,125
<i> Breakfast, tractor driving
and shoveling...</i>

11
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,593
<i>Hey, big Boston Marathon,</i>

12
00:00:27,593 --> 00:00:28,727
<i> 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.</i>

13
00:00:28,727 --> 00:00:30,596
<i> The wheelchairs go off
by noon.</i>

14
00:00:30,596 --> 00:00:32,765
<i> Temperature about 50.
Partly sunny.</i>

15
00:00:32,765 --> 00:00:35,634
<i> 3:00, 55 degrees
and light winds.</i>

16
00:00:35,634 --> 00:00:37,236
<i> It's gonna be a perfect day.</i>

17
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,308
<i>You know,
there is a renewed hope</i>

18
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:44,213
<i> for the Red Sox
after two of the last plays...</i>

19
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,482
Here we go, John.
Feeling good about this year.

20
00:00:50,616 --> 00:00:51,616
You said it.

21
00:00:50,616 --> 00:00:51,459
Go Sox.

22
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:01,203
Seriously?

23
00:01:15,174 --> 00:01:18,277
Hey, Tom! Don't spray.
I'm walkin' through here.

24
00:01:18,277 --> 00:01:19,512
What's that smell?

25
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:23,148
Shit.

26
00:01:26,218 --> 00:01:27,686
Ah! Shit!

27
00:01:27,686 --> 00:01:29,188
What'd you do?

28
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:30,189
<i>I'd been checkin'
on the timer,</i>

29
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:31,724
I didn't turn on by mistake,

30
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:33,325
so I didn't hear the noise,
I didn't hear the beep.

31
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:34,627
And if you hear the beeps,
then you'd be able

32
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,627
to stop 'em...

33
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,362
You're supposed to

34
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:37,463
clear the roasters before
you empty the trash, Jeff.

35
00:01:37,463 --> 00:01:38,864
...'cause I didn't hear
the beeps.

36
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:40,466
Okay, Maya, I'll sign off
on an hour of OT,

37
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:41,934
so Jeff can help clean up.
Does that work

38
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:43,934
for both of you guys?

39
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:43,602
Actually, sir, there's...

40
00:01:43,602 --> 00:01:45,905
I got something I gotta do.

41
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,573
What do you got's
so important...

42
00:01:47,573 --> 00:01:48,908
You just make
this big mess

43
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:50,276
and leave me here
to clean it up?

44
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,744
Look, the Sox lost
two in a row

45
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,345
because of me, all right?

46
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:55,347
I missed both games
because I was at work.

47
00:01:55,347 --> 00:01:57,249
I wasn't in my lucky seat
with my lucky beer.

48
00:01:57,249 --> 00:01:59,185
You got a lucky beer?

49
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:00,419
Yeah, I mean, I just...

50
00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:01,720
Beer in general's lucky,
right?

51
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,459
Okay, this is your call, Maya.

52
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:09,295
All right.

53
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,496
I got you. Look at you.

54
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:11,664
Thank you, Maya.

55
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:12,866
You owe me.

56
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:15,367
Do me a favor, sir.

57
00:02:15,367 --> 00:02:16,635
Don't report
our office romance, okay?

58
00:02:16,635 --> 00:02:18,304
I know it's against
Costco policy,

59
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,405
but sometimes you gotta
make a sacrifice, right?

60
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:20,977
Please go
watch the game.

61
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:26,812
Here's my baby boy.

62
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:28,812
Can I get another pitcher?

63
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:28,647
Don't you think

64
00:02:28,647 --> 00:02:30,282
he's gettin' too skinny,
Patty?

65
00:02:30,282 --> 00:02:31,517
And he needs
a fuckin' haircut.

66
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:32,885
Friggin' perfect.

67
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:34,386
Look at that face.

68
00:02:34,386 --> 00:02:35,921
The face is cute.

69
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:37,921
Shit!

70
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,891
Oh, Ma, hey.

71
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:40,891
She's good.

72
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:40,593
Careful, there.

73
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:41,894
You wanna sit somewhere lower?
That fall's a doozy.

74
00:02:41,894 --> 00:02:43,696
Yeah, you go
fuck yourself, sweetie.

75
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,566
All right, thanks. Hey.

76
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:49,303
He's my favorite nephew.

77
00:02:51,303 --> 00:02:52,738
Jesus, Jeff,

78
00:02:52,738 --> 00:02:54,240
you still smell like
fuckin' chicken carcasses.

79
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,908
Buchholz is on fire.
Look at him.

80
00:02:55,908 --> 00:02:57,908
He's a fuckin' beast.

81
00:02:55,908 --> 00:02:57,009
That coulda been you, D.

82
00:02:58,009 --> 00:02:59,009
On TV. Rich and famous.

83
00:02:58,009 --> 00:02:59,845
Yeah.

84
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:02,681
Quit pitchin' in high school
like a fuckin' pussy.

85
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:06,452
You're a pussy.
Shut up, faggot.

86
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:07,720
Nobody says "faggot"
anymore, D.

87
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,355
Oh, really? What do you
know about it, huh?

88
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,856
What do you mean?
I'm down with the homos.

89
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:12,856
My boss at Costco's gay.

90
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:12,858
Your fuckin' boss?

91
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:14,526
You think
I get this fashionable

92
00:03:14,526 --> 00:03:16,362
without it's some sort of
fuckin' insider help?

93
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,730
For the record, hey...

94
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,998
For the record,
I didn't pussy outta shit.

95
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,699
I had a herniated disk.
You both know that.

96
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:22,968
Shut the fuck up,
both of you.

97
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:24,370
You're an asshole. Shut up.

98
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,005
Who you callin' a faggot,
Derek?

99
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:28,474
No, apparently we don't say
that word no more, Uncle Bob.

100
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:29,975
You know,
Jeff's boss is a gay.

101
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,013
What? He is!

102
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,013
Where have you been?

103
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,953
Not with
the rest of us, apparently.

104
00:03:40,953 --> 00:03:42,990
Bauman? You havin'
a stroke or somethin'?

105
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,629
Oh, shit.
Look who's here.

106
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:52,364
Hey, give me a second.

107
00:03:52,364 --> 00:03:53,632
Nobody wants to fuck a guy
with chicken in his hair.

108
00:03:53,632 --> 00:03:55,434
Why you touchin' my hair,
Uncle Bob?

109
00:03:55,434 --> 00:03:57,936
Come back after she tells you
to go fuck yourself, okay?

110
00:03:57,936 --> 00:03:59,040
Sit down
and watch the game, bro.

111
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,813
She broke up with you.

112
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:08,947
Hey.

113
00:04:08,947 --> 00:04:09,950
Hey.

114
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,950
Are you...

115
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,719
What?

116
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,856
Are...

117
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,325
The sister's here.

118
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,993
Who? Gail?

119
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:22,993
Yeah.

120
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:22,831
She looks good, though.

121
00:04:25,831 --> 00:04:27,831
Hey.

122
00:04:25,831 --> 00:04:27,700
Hey.

123
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,068
I, like... I texted you,

124
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,703
like, six times.
You never get...

125
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,871
Did you get my texts or not?

126
00:04:32,871 --> 00:04:35,708
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Yeah, I got 'em.

127
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:36,615
Cool.

128
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:45,615
Hey, Gail.

129
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:45,384
Jeff.

130
00:04:45,384 --> 00:04:47,086
So what are you two
Amesbury ladies

131
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:48,854
slummin' it here for, anyway?

132
00:04:48,854 --> 00:04:51,623
I'm collecting donations
for the Marathon.

133
00:04:51,623 --> 00:04:53,623
No shit?

134
00:04:51,623 --> 00:04:53,360
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

135
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,360
All right.

136
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,961
Yep.

137
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:59,465
You got a jar, huh?
With pictures of yourself.

138
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,766
That's so great.

139
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:02,468
So you show people
pictures of yourself

140
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,468
and then you ask for money.

141
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,036
Yes. It usually works.

142
00:05:04,036 --> 00:05:06,138
That's very...
That's a smart idea.

143
00:05:06,138 --> 00:05:07,906
It feels like
you're self-promoting.

144
00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:09,408
That's really...

145
00:05:09,408 --> 00:05:11,076
I am. That's literally
what I'm doing.

146
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:12,978
Yeah, but you know what?
Like, if you try and pass this

147
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:14,079
around with
pictures of yourself,

148
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,614
it's gonna be like, it's...

149
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:17,049
You shouldn't do that.
You need my help.

150
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:18,417
I already got...

151
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:19,718
You're gonna need
inside help.

152
00:05:19,718 --> 00:05:21,687
Oh, really?
Gonna give money or what?

153
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:22,921
No. Hey! Listen up!

154
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:25,491
Hear ye! Hear ye!

155
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,792
Give me a heart attack.

156
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:28,394
Citizens of Chelmsford!

157
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,394
Oh, no, no, no.

158
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,795
Citizens of Chelmsford!

159
00:05:29,795 --> 00:05:31,063
Jeff. Jeff.

160
00:05:31,063 --> 00:05:33,499
This young lady here
is running the Marathon

161
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,168
for Brigham and Women's
Hospital. Okay?

162
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:39,138
Where she also works
as a big-shot administrator.

163
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,974
So skip a round o' Stella,
ya fat fucks!

164
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:44,974
And donate to a good cause.

165
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:46,843
Yeah!

166
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,715
Hey, listen.

167
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:51,683
Put your moolah
in the fishbowl.

168
00:05:51,683 --> 00:05:54,453
Just a couple o' bucks.
All right?

169
00:05:54,453 --> 00:05:55,888
Here ya go.

170
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,888
She'll take food stamps...

171
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,589
Stop smiling!

172
00:05:57,589 --> 00:05:58,824
...Chuck E. Cheese
tickets, whatever you got.

173
00:05:58,824 --> 00:06:00,824
You are such a...

174
00:05:58,824 --> 00:06:00,592
What?

175
00:06:00,592 --> 00:06:02,194
Whoever thought
you'd end up being in, like,

176
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:05,497
this torrid melodrama with
a chicken roaster from Costco?

177
00:06:05,497 --> 00:06:07,466
What do you have
against him? He's a nice guy.

178
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:10,202
You broke up with him
three times. Real nice.

179
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:12,971
Erin! E.

180
00:06:12,971 --> 00:06:16,842
E, E, E, E!
Hey. Hey. Hey, hey.

181
00:06:16,842 --> 00:06:18,877
Can I come cheer ya on?

182
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:20,979
Why don't you
run it with her, Jeff?

183
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:22,681
Well, you know,
I suffered an injury

184
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:24,116
from a chicken-related

185
00:06:24,116 --> 00:06:25,884
industrial accident today,
Gail, so, you know.

186
00:06:25,884 --> 00:06:27,786
But, hey, I'm gonna be there
at the finish line for ya.

187
00:06:27,786 --> 00:06:29,622
Don't the Red Sox
play tomorrow?

188
00:06:30,622 --> 00:06:33,622
So?

189
00:06:30,622 --> 00:06:33,225
So?

190
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:35,894
I'm gonna make
a big sign for ya!

191
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:38,797
I mean, that's gotta be worth
at least a dinner, right?

192
00:06:38,797 --> 00:06:40,797
Bye, Jeff.

193
00:06:38,797 --> 00:06:40,566
No, come on, I mean it!

194
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,601
I mean it. Hey,
I'm gonna be there,
all right?

195
00:06:42,601 --> 00:06:43,936
Take care
of your finger, Jeff.

196
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,637
Hey, I'll be there, all right?

197
00:06:45,637 --> 00:06:47,637
Dinner's pushing it!

198
00:06:45,637 --> 00:06:47,239
You're gonna win it all!

199
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:49,543
E. E!

200
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:52,864
So lunch it is?

201
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,675
Oh, yeah. Go Sox.

202
00:07:34,553 --> 00:07:36,755
It's too high.

203
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:39,660
God. Never again.

204
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,660
Jeffrey!

205
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,829
What, Ma?

206
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:46,865
Will you get me
some aspirin?
'Cause I can't reach.

207
00:07:46,865 --> 00:07:49,668
Is there a...
You have an orange marker?

208
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:51,668
Ma!

209
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:51,069
Yeah!

210
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:53,038
There's an orange marker.
It was right here.

211
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:54,038
Don't make me shout, baby.

212
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:54,973
Never mind.

213
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:57,576
Tiny mice
with big hammers in my skull.

214
00:07:57,576 --> 00:07:58,011
I can't reach the aspirin.

215
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:00,216
Ma, it's on the...

216
00:08:04,216 --> 00:08:06,919
I'm gonna be late.

217
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:09,721
My God. Why do you
always put it up here?

218
00:08:09,721 --> 00:08:12,291
Who puts it up here?
I don't understand.

219
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,291
Thank you, baby.

220
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,126
It's a new one. Yeah.

221
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:15,694
Okay. All right.

222
00:08:15,694 --> 00:08:18,564
Hey, Can...
Can you fix the chirpy thing?

223
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:20,564
What?

224
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:20,198
Chirpy chirp.

225
00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:21,000
What? You mean the low battery
alarm on the smoke detector?

226
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,635
Yeah, it's driving me
bat-shit crazy.

227
00:08:23,635 --> 00:08:25,237
That's not a long drive.

228
00:08:25,237 --> 00:08:26,805
You can't have
Uncle Bob come by

229
00:08:26,805 --> 00:08:28,340
and do it on his way to work?

230
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,942
Jesus Christ.

231
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:31,611
What you got there?

232
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:34,212
It's just a thing.

233
00:08:34,212 --> 00:08:36,649
I don't know why you keep
tryin' with that girl anyway.

234
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:40,821
Hey, wait,
I made breakfast.

235
00:08:44,122 --> 00:08:46,658
<i>More than 27,000 runners</i>

236
00:08:46,658 --> 00:08:49,328
<i> are running in today's
Boston Marathon.</i>

237
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,697
<i> The race is just now
getting underway.</i>

238
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,365
<i> More than
half a million people...</i>

239
00:09:25,664 --> 00:09:27,933
Oh, that's your brother?

240
00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:29,901
What's... What's his name?

241
00:09:32,771 --> 00:09:33,641
Go Chris!

242
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:40,913
Is that guy runnin'
in his underwear like that?

243
00:09:41,913 --> 00:09:43,716
What's that about?

244
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:45,124
Ah!

245
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:35,300
<i>Coming up in a big plume.</i>

246
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,968
<i> We're hearing from one of</i>

247
00:10:36,968 --> 00:10:38,837
<i> our producers
there on the ground</i>

248
00:10:38,837 --> 00:10:42,908
<i> that it was this large bang
on one side of the street.</i>

249
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,476
<i>What are they trying to do?</i>

250
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:45,476
<i>Erin, are you okay?</i>

251
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:45,844
I'm fine. I'm fine.

252
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:47,844
<i> Where are you?</i>

253
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:47,179
Just a bar.

254
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,179
I don't know...

255
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,880
<i> How are you gettin' home?</i>

256
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,849
I dunno.
My stuff is all back...

257
00:10:50,849 --> 00:10:52,350
<i> Thank God you're okay.</i>

258
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,351
Yeah. At the buses.
It's back at the buses.

259
00:10:53,351 --> 00:10:55,287
<i> How are you gonna get
your car keys?</i>

260
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,955
I dunno.
I don't know how to get there.

261
00:10:56,955 --> 00:10:58,857
<i> Stay where you are.
I'll come find you.</i>

262
00:10:58,857 --> 00:11:00,125
Yeah.

263
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,793
<i>At least five,</i>

264
00:11:01,793 --> 00:11:03,793
<i> six people hurt.</i>

265
00:11:01,793 --> 00:11:03,261
<i>Where can I meet you?</i>

266
00:11:03,261 --> 00:11:04,296
<i>But I have a feeling
there are more.</i>

267
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:05,931
<i>Where can I meet you?</i>

268
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,466
<i>The photos, injuries to those</i>

269
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,768
<i> in the blast area
are quite severe.</i>

270
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:12,037
<i> Just a tragic scene here
in Boston today.</i>

271
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:13,105
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

272
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:33,360
Yeah, hello.

273
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,197
It's Patty, yeah.

274
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,942
And you know
they would've told you

275
00:11:50,942 --> 00:11:52,144
if he was dead, right?

276
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,845
How do you even know that,
Karen?

277
00:11:53,845 --> 00:11:54,880
You know I spent
my fair share of time

278
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,114
in a goddamn hospital.

279
00:11:56,114 --> 00:11:57,082
Well,
this ain't about you!

280
00:11:57,082 --> 00:11:58,150
Didn't say it was! Jesus!

281
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,384
Will you two stop?

282
00:11:59,384 --> 00:12:00,919
They're gonna be
calling our name.

283
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,320
You can't right now,
you can't.

284
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,855
Where's my son,
God damn it?

285
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:05,855
What the hell happened?

286
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:05,924
Oh, Jesus Christ!

287
00:12:05,924 --> 00:12:08,460
Where is he? Patty?
What's goin' on with my son?

288
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,528
Calm down.

289
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:10,097
Don't tell me what to do, Bob!

290
00:12:12,097 --> 00:12:13,899
Patty, what's going on
with my son?

291
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,200
We don't know yet.

292
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,200
Bauman family?

293
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,802
Yes!

294
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,802
Bauman!

295
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,436
Yeah, we're with...

296
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:20,038
We're with Jeff Bauman.

297
00:12:20,038 --> 00:12:22,043
Right here. We're his family.

298
00:12:30,248 --> 00:12:31,316
Mr. and Mrs. Bauman?

299
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:32,316
Yeah.

300
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:32,417
Mmm. Yes.

301
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:34,085
I'm Dr. Kalish.

302
00:12:34,085 --> 00:12:35,085
Jeff's alive.

303
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,921
Your son's alive.

304
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,390
Yeah. All right.

305
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,892
Thank you, thank you.

306
00:12:40,892 --> 00:12:45,564
So, Jeff came in bleeding
with tourniquets on both legs,

307
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,099
and he was intubated
right away

308
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:49,601
and then
brought up immediately

309
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:51,337
<i> to the operating room.</i>

310
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:54,337
Hi.

311
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:54,306
I'm looking for Jeff Bauman.

312
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:55,006
Um, you're gonna
have to sign in here.

313
00:12:56,006 --> 00:12:57,542
Put his name here and
we'll find out where he is.

314
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:58,510
Um, can you tell me if
he's at this hospital, please?

315
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,078
I... I can't tell you.

316
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:01,913
I saw a picture.
I know he's at a hospital.

317
00:13:01,913 --> 00:13:02,913
I just don't know which one.

318
00:13:01,913 --> 00:13:02,881
Please go to the waiting room

319
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:04,216
and I'll get you in here.

320
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:05,517
Can you please just
tell me what floor he's on?

321
00:13:05,517 --> 00:13:07,452
It's crazy right now.
I will help you.

322
00:13:07,452 --> 00:13:08,520
<i>Jeff underwent a double</i>

323
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,355
<i> above-the-knee amputation.</i>

324
00:13:10,355 --> 00:13:12,324
<i> Most of the destruction had
actually already been done</i>

325
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,125
<i> by the bomb below the knees,</i>

326
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:17,596
and it was very obvious
to all the surgeons involved

327
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,531
that there was no way
to salvage anything

328
00:13:19,531 --> 00:13:22,334
below the knee.

329
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:25,403
We had to get higher than
the knee to get clean skin,

330
00:13:25,403 --> 00:13:27,439
clean muscle, clean tissue.

331
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,734
Oh, my God.

332
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:13,078
I gotta get
something to drink.

333
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,013
Um, do you want me
to get you a Coke,

334
00:15:15,013 --> 00:15:16,573
or chips, or something?

335
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:43,408
<i>As they look through all these</i>

336
00:15:43,408 --> 00:15:45,243
<i> little pieces, Brian,
they think the bomb now</i>

337
00:15:45,243 --> 00:15:47,045
<i> was made
by putting the components</i>

338
00:15:47,045 --> 00:15:49,147
<i> inside a pressure cooker pot.</i>

339
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:52,650
<i> And in there were nails,
BBs and ball bearings</i>

340
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,053
<i> to magnify the destructive</i>

341
00:15:55,053 --> 00:15:57,555
<i> and injury-causing nature
of the blast.</i>

342
00:15:57,555 --> 00:16:00,125
<i> And the explosive
was gunpowder.</i>

343
00:16:16,274 --> 00:16:18,043
Some guy asked me

344
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:20,645
if my son is still unconscious
while I'm takin' a leak,

345
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:22,047
and I'm supposed to know

346
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:23,581
this freak
is a fuckin' reporter?

347
00:16:23,581 --> 00:16:25,216
It ain't suspicious to ya?
A stranger chattin' it up

348
00:16:25,216 --> 00:16:26,384
while you got your dick
in your hand?

349
00:16:26,384 --> 00:16:28,119
Jenny, I was washin' my hands.

350
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:29,487
Shut the fuck up! You're
fucking yelling about Jeff!

351
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:30,789
Ah, Jesus...

352
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,490
Stop talking about her son!

353
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,825
He's my son, too.

354
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:34,825
It's hers.

355
00:16:33,825 --> 00:16:34,659
Shut up.

356
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:36,094
What do you want?

357
00:16:36,094 --> 00:16:37,562
I'm so sorry to intrude.

358
00:16:37,562 --> 00:16:38,696
You're another
reporter, aren't you?

359
00:16:38,696 --> 00:16:40,165
Don't let him in, Jeff.

360
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,100
I'm sorry, I'm, um,
looking for Patty Joyce.

361
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,268
I'm Patty.

362
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:44,536
Did you not hear us?

363
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:46,536
I'm Kevin Horst. Uh...

364
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:46,137
Who?

365
00:16:46,137 --> 00:16:48,239
I'm Jeff's manager at Costco.

366
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:49,507
Check his ID.

367
00:16:49,507 --> 00:16:51,176
These reporters
will try everything.

368
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,244
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're... You're Carl, right?

369
00:16:53,244 --> 00:16:56,147
Yeah, Jeff talks about ya.

370
00:16:56,147 --> 00:16:57,516
Well, ya heard
what happened, huh?

371
00:16:58,516 --> 00:16:59,186
Yeah.

372
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,588
You know our son
lost his legs, right?

373
00:17:03,588 --> 00:17:06,588
I know.

374
00:17:03,588 --> 00:17:06,558
And you brought breakfast?

375
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,558
That's not helpful.

376
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,126
Uh, thank you very much.

377
00:17:08,126 --> 00:17:09,461
Maybe we should
wait to eat 'em

378
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:10,829
so you can go
grab your camera.

379
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,430
Take a picture
for your Costco newsletter.

380
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,799
I'm... Really, I'm happy
to bring whatever you like.

381
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,167
What could you
possibly get us

382
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:17,402
that we need right now, Kevin?

383
00:17:17,402 --> 00:17:19,404
Well, I took the liberty
of printing up...

384
00:17:19,404 --> 00:17:21,439
A fucking joke.
You kiddin' me?

385
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,209
...his policy
and I've highlighted the areas

386
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,610
that you'll need to sign.

387
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,679
Don't sign nothin'
without a goddamn lawyer!

388
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,214
Can you just let him talk
for a second?

389
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,682
Who are you again?

390
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:32,250
Yeah, shut the fuck up
and let him talk.

391
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,451
What's he gonna say
that we need

392
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:34,451
to hear right now?

393
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:34,752
I don't know.

394
00:17:34,752 --> 00:17:36,621
Okay, answer me this.
Answer me this.

395
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:39,358
My son makes it through this,
where's he gonna work, Kevin?

396
00:17:40,358 --> 00:17:41,493
Where's he gonna work?

397
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:43,862
Hmm? You gonna hire him back?

398
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:46,164
Jesus Christ.
We need this right now?

399
00:17:46,164 --> 00:17:47,899
Yes, we do!

400
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:50,869
Who's gonna hire him
without any legs, Patty?

401
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,637
We can't
rehire him, sir.

402
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:53,872
See? I told ya.

403
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,206
Mr. Bauman, please,
let me finish.

404
00:17:55,206 --> 00:17:56,674
We can't rehire him,

405
00:17:56,674 --> 00:17:58,744
'cause he'll never have
stopped working for us.

406
00:17:59,744 --> 00:18:02,580
We're not letting Jeff go.

407
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,617
And these... This is stupid.
But this is just...

408
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:08,253
You know, this is just to
get the insurance goin'

409
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,654
and get that rollin'.

410
00:18:09,654 --> 00:18:10,822
Wait, insurance?

411
00:18:10,822 --> 00:18:12,657
Yes.

412
00:18:12,657 --> 00:18:14,325
Jeffrey has insurance?

413
00:18:14,325 --> 00:18:16,628
Of course, of course. Um...

414
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:21,799
Plus legal, mental health,
or financial advice

415
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:25,236
for Jeff or any member
of the family.

416
00:18:25,236 --> 00:18:28,341
And I've included
my personal cell

417
00:18:30,341 --> 00:18:32,343
at the top there. Um...

418
00:18:32,343 --> 00:18:34,212
All right, good.

419
00:18:34,212 --> 00:18:38,383
Good, I'm glad you guys
are doin' the right thing.

420
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,785
So, what kinda
muffins we got there?

421
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,857
<i>All of those things happened</i>

422
00:19:19,857 --> 00:19:21,426
<i> in preparation for this event.</i>

423
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:22,794
<i> But there was
no specific intelligence</i>

424
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:23,795
<i> that anything
was going to happen.</i>

425
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,330
<i> At this point in time,
it's too early</i>

426
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,464
<i> to get into the specifics.</i>

427
00:19:26,464 --> 00:19:27,765
<i> These were powerful devices</i>

428
00:19:27,765 --> 00:19:29,801
<i> that resulted
in serious injuries.</i>

429
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:32,337
<i>Do you have
someone in custody?</i>

430
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,472
<i>Those reports are not true.</i>

431
00:19:34,472 --> 00:19:35,007
<i> There is no suspect
in custody.</i>

432
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:37,275
<i> We're questioning many people,</i>

433
00:19:37,275 --> 00:19:40,682
<i> but there is no one in custody
at this point in time.</i>

434
00:19:44,682 --> 00:19:46,417
Jeff?

435
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:48,488
Holy shit. Are you awake, bro?

436
00:19:50,488 --> 00:19:51,491
You hear me?

437
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:56,329
Okay. Okay, okay.

438
00:19:58,329 --> 00:20:02,636
Uh, so I gotta tell ya,
there was an explosion.

439
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,872
And your fuckin' legs...

440
00:20:07,872 --> 00:20:09,389
They're gone, bro.

441
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,890
What are you doin', buddy?

442
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,027
I can't tell what
your fingers are doin'.

443
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,796
What, you wanna
write somethin'?

444
00:20:31,796 --> 00:20:32,602
Hold on.

445
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:39,537
Here, buddy, here.
Here's a pen.

446
00:20:39,537 --> 00:20:41,645
Yeah, grab that.

447
00:20:47,645 --> 00:20:49,013
Erin? Erin, yeah, she's fine,
she's here. She's...

448
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:53,551
The whole family's here.
Everyone's down the hall.

449
00:20:53,551 --> 00:20:55,095
You okay? How you feelin'?

450
00:21:04,095 --> 00:21:05,632
"Lieutenant Dan"?

451
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,403
<i>You mean the guy from
Forrest Gump with no legs?</i>

452
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,462
Oh, shit. Don't move.

453
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,596
Bob, Bob, wake up!

454
00:21:38,596 --> 00:21:39,864
What the hell, D?

455
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:41,864
Jeff's awake.

456
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:41,132
Huh?

457
00:21:41,132 --> 00:21:43,434
He wrote this.

458
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:46,434
The last part.

459
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:46,137
Holy shit.

460
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:48,137
What happened? D?

461
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:48,706
He's awake.

462
00:21:48,706 --> 00:21:50,706
Where's the FBI office?

463
00:21:48,706 --> 00:21:50,875
Bob.

464
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,875
Hey!

465
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,144
Bob.

466
00:21:53,144 --> 00:21:54,144
Hey!

467
00:21:53,144 --> 00:21:54,579
Bob.

468
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:55,980
Hey!

469
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,615
Hey!

470
00:21:57,615 --> 00:21:58,615
Jeffie.

471
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,485
Cut it down, guys.
This is just...

472
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,153
Jeffrey? Hey, baby.

473
00:22:02,153 --> 00:22:05,723
Oh, my God, we are so happy
you're back with us.

474
00:22:05,723 --> 00:22:07,158
Uh... Um, now listen,

475
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:10,962
some of the FBI guys
are gonna come in.

476
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:15,633
They're gonna ask ya,
y'know, a... A few questions.

477
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:17,101
So... Okay?

478
00:22:17,101 --> 00:22:20,505
And all ya gotta do is
just tell 'em what ya saw.

479
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,773
That's great.

480
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:22,874
We're removing
the intubation tube.

481
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,609
We need everyone to clear out.

482
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:25,743
But we just got...

483
00:22:25,743 --> 00:22:27,545
We'll be back.

484
00:22:27,545 --> 00:22:28,980
We're just getting ready to
take the breathing tube out.

485
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,980
See ya later.

486
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,715
It'll be okay.

487
00:22:30,715 --> 00:22:32,583
Let's go. Let's go.

488
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:34,621
We gotta get
that tube out, okay?

489
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,156
You ready, buddy?

490
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:41,125
What's wrong, bud?
You want her?

491
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:43,628
Yeah. I'mma let her stay.
It's okay.

492
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:45,763
It's okay.
You're all right, buddy.

493
00:22:45,763 --> 00:22:47,198
Relax, okay?

494
00:22:47,198 --> 00:22:48,666
All right, we have
a couple minutes of hubbub

495
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:50,435
before we get the tube out.

496
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:51,903
Open your mouth. We just gonna
clean your mouth first.

497
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:53,738
Then we're gonna get
that tube out.

498
00:22:53,738 --> 00:22:56,941
Relax. Lemme just take off
some tape. Perfect.

499
00:22:56,941 --> 00:22:58,941
Slow breaths.

500
00:22:56,941 --> 00:22:58,776
We have a cuff link.

501
00:22:58,776 --> 00:23:00,945
Here we go, bud. Ready?

502
00:23:00,945 --> 00:23:02,914
One, two, three.
Take a big breath.

503
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:05,082
Big breath, big breath.

504
00:23:05,082 --> 00:23:06,150
Big breath.

505
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,150
Take a big breath.

506
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,623
Okay. Relax, relax.

507
00:23:12,623 --> 00:23:15,660
Slow breaths. She's just gonna
suction your mouth again.

508
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,028
Slow breaths, bud.

509
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:18,229
Good job. Can you say "Hi"?

510
00:23:18,229 --> 00:23:19,664
Hi.

511
00:23:21,132 --> 00:23:23,568
Okay, good job, good job.

512
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,702
We're gonna put
this mask on.

513
00:23:24,702 --> 00:23:25,903
Put that on. Relax.

514
00:23:25,903 --> 00:23:27,638
All right.
You can talk to him,

515
00:23:27,638 --> 00:23:28,973
but he can't answer you, okay?

516
00:23:28,973 --> 00:23:30,973
Okay.

517
00:23:28,973 --> 00:23:30,776
Yes and no.

518
00:23:31,776 --> 00:23:34,078
Okay? All right, buddy.

519
00:23:34,078 --> 00:23:36,078
Great job, great job.

520
00:23:34,078 --> 00:23:36,053
Good to go, kid.

521
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:43,053
Hey, E.

522
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:43,789
Mmm?

523
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:46,259
You're sittin' on my leg.

524
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:49,731
Oh.

525
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:58,667
Hi.

526
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:58,804
Hi.

527
00:24:02,573 --> 00:24:03,843
No talking. No talking.

528
00:24:05,843 --> 00:24:06,978
I'm a tough guy.

529
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:08,280
No talking.

530
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,618
I know you're tough.

531
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,820
Is he in there
tellin' 'em
about the bomber?

532
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,724
Yeah, I think so.

533
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:23,028
Fuckin' miracle.
My boy. Fuckin' hero.

534
00:24:24,028 --> 00:24:25,229
You bet.

535
00:24:25,229 --> 00:24:26,731
Sorta the same
kinda build,

536
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:29,166
but, like,
maybe a little taller.

537
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:31,903
But I looked him
right in the eyes,

538
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:33,571
so he's the same...

539
00:24:33,571 --> 00:24:34,741
Was he young or old?

540
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:38,779
Yeah, he was young.

541
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:43,648
Yeah.

542
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,685
<i>What do you remember
after the blast?</i>

543
00:24:47,685 --> 00:24:48,058
<i>Uh...</i>

544
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:55,595
There was, like, this smell.

545
00:24:57,595 --> 00:24:59,031
Like, it smelled like...

546
00:25:01,031 --> 00:25:03,031
Take your time.

547
00:25:04,268 --> 00:25:06,071
Like the Fourth of July.

548
00:25:11,876 --> 00:25:13,277
<i>...is now, in fact,</i>

549
00:25:13,277 --> 00:25:14,779
<i> we know, dead.
All right Dr. Schoenfeld,</i>

550
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:15,913
<i> thank you so much
for joining us.</i>

551
00:25:15,913 --> 00:25:17,181
<i> We really appreciate it.</i>

552
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:19,183
<i> Obviously, Dr. Schoenfeld,
limited by what he can say</i>

553
00:25:19,183 --> 00:25:21,051
<i> because of the situation,
obviously,</i>

554
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:23,688
<i> this huge manhunt
being watched worldwide.</i>

555
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,223
<i> An individual,
Suspect Number 1,</i>

556
00:25:26,223 --> 00:25:28,059
<i> now dead, we know.</i>

557
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,894
Fuckin' A!

558
00:25:29,894 --> 00:25:31,894
Oh, my God!

559
00:25:29,894 --> 00:25:31,029
You son of a bitch!

560
00:25:33,664 --> 00:25:35,073
Kill that
other son of a bitch, too!

561
00:26:05,863 --> 00:26:09,068
Jeffrey, I just met Carlos.

562
00:26:11,068 --> 00:26:13,252
He's the guy
who saved your life.

563
00:26:28,252 --> 00:26:29,787
Would you
like a coffee?

564
00:26:29,787 --> 00:26:31,292
I brought some...
I've got some coffees.

565
00:26:35,292 --> 00:26:37,766
Don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

566
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,367
I think everyone
in that hospital

567
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:45,337
is thinking
that same thing.

568
00:26:46,337 --> 00:26:47,909
Yeah.

569
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:54,147
We broke up
about a month ago,
me and Jeff.

570
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,383
It's not the first time,

571
00:26:59,383 --> 00:27:01,889
but we usually
get back together.

572
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:06,059
Not this time?

573
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:11,896
Doesn't show up
for anything.

574
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,464
He's always late.

575
00:27:13,464 --> 00:27:16,801
You know, he...
He never wants
to leave his apartment.

576
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,938
I'm just fed up
with it.

577
00:27:20,938 --> 00:27:22,406
And then he shows up.

578
00:27:37,354 --> 00:27:39,790
<i>Sounded like
multiple assault
rifle shots to me.</i>

579
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,193
<i>FEMALE REPORTER: 8:15 p.m.
A person is cornered</i>

580
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:44,228
<i> on a boat in a yard
in Watertown.</i>

581
00:27:44,228 --> 00:27:45,863
<i>A suspect in the boat.</i>

582
00:27:45,863 --> 00:27:47,231
<i>Hundreds of law enforcement...</i>

583
00:27:47,231 --> 00:27:48,432
Hi.

584
00:27:48,432 --> 00:27:49,967
Jeff, how you doin'?

585
00:27:49,967 --> 00:27:51,368
So, Jeff, we have to do

586
00:27:51,368 --> 00:27:52,937
the first dressing change
today.

587
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:54,805
Okay, we're gonna take
these bandages off.

588
00:27:56,907 --> 00:27:58,442
I'm not looking.

589
00:27:58,442 --> 00:27:59,944
Things get
too rough, please let us know

590
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:01,979
and we can figure out
how to help you.

591
00:28:01,979 --> 00:28:03,447
I'm sorry?

592
00:28:03,447 --> 00:28:04,915
And did you
already pre-medicate him

593
00:28:04,915 --> 00:28:06,915
for the dressing change?

594
00:28:04,915 --> 00:28:06,250
Yep.

595
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:09,854
He's already gotten his oxy
and his dilaudid PO.

596
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,956
He has a PR in fentanyl
for breakthrough.

597
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,390
And I have plenty
in my pocket.

598
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,892
Now some
people like to look.

599
00:28:14,892 --> 00:28:16,227
Some people
don't like to look at all.

600
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:18,227
No.

601
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:18,262
I don't wanna
look at me now.

602
00:28:18,262 --> 00:28:20,998
So, Marion, if you
can hold up the right leg...

603
00:28:20,998 --> 00:28:22,998
Okay.

604
00:28:20,998 --> 00:28:22,266
...that would be very helpful

605
00:28:22,266 --> 00:28:24,535
and we'll unwrap 'em now.

606
00:28:24,535 --> 00:28:26,971
All righty.
I'm gonna just lift ya up.

607
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:27,005
You're gonna feel my hands.

608
00:28:28,005 --> 00:28:29,143
I'm sorry, hon.

609
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:33,511
So I'm just
taking the tape off

610
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:36,280
and I'm gonna unwrap
the Ace bandage first.

611
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,215
This shouldn't be too bad.

612
00:28:38,215 --> 00:28:41,152
But if you have
any sharp pains
or anything,

613
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:43,854
please let me know.

614
00:28:43,854 --> 00:28:45,156
All right,
you're gonna feel my hands.

615
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:47,892
Tell me if you're ready.
Did that kick in yet?

616
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,892
Doing okay?

617
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,493
Yeah, yeah.

618
00:28:49,493 --> 00:28:51,493
All right.

619
00:28:53,297 --> 00:28:55,500
Almost done with the gauze.

620
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,302
Fuck.

621
00:28:58,302 --> 00:28:59,436
You okay?

622
00:28:59,436 --> 00:29:01,906
Yeah.

623
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,175
You let us know
if you need a break, okay?

624
00:29:06,577 --> 00:29:08,245
You're okay.

625
00:29:08,245 --> 00:29:09,580
Don't look at 'em.

626
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,315
I'm not lookin' at 'em.
Lookin' at you.

627
00:29:11,315 --> 00:29:12,383
Okay, now
this might be a little sticky.

628
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:13,851
God!

629
00:29:13,851 --> 00:29:14,852
Doin' great.
Doin' great.

630
00:29:14,852 --> 00:29:17,054
You're doin' awesome.

631
00:29:17,054 --> 00:29:19,058
Okay, the dressing's off.
We'll give you a minute.

632
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:23,058
Nice little breaths.

633
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:23,194
Good job.

634
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:25,196
In your nose,
out your mouth.

635
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:26,397
You're doing so great.

636
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:27,932
That was the worst.

637
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,307
Getting the dressings off
is the worst.

638
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:38,909
Want a little
more fentanyl?

639
00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:40,477
Okay.

640
00:29:40,477 --> 00:29:42,112
'Cause now we're gonna

641
00:29:42,112 --> 00:29:43,047
take off the dressing
on the left side, okay?

642
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:44,481
Yeah.

643
00:29:44,481 --> 00:29:45,850
You mind going
over there, Marion?

644
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,050
We're just gonna set up.

645
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:47,050
We're not touching
anything yet.

646
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,253
We're just settin' up.

647
00:29:49,253 --> 00:29:50,021
Just gonna shimmy
this down a little.

648
00:29:51,021 --> 00:29:53,424
Okay. All right, I'm gonna
lift up, one, two, three.

649
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:54,558
You're gonna feel this again.

650
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:56,059
Pretty much
just like the other one.

651
00:29:56,059 --> 00:29:58,462
Cock!

652
00:29:58,462 --> 00:30:00,462
Sorry, hon.

653
00:29:58,462 --> 00:30:00,497
You're okay.

654
00:30:00,497 --> 00:30:01,966
I have the fentanyl
in my pocket.

655
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,234
Do you want me
to give you that?

656
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:04,902
Yeah, yeah.
Let's give that to him.

657
00:30:04,902 --> 00:30:06,370
All right,
we're gonna take a break.

658
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:07,605
We'll give you
some more medicine.

659
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:08,973
Okay,
let me just get to...

660
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,174
I'm just gonna
work around you,

661
00:30:10,174 --> 00:30:11,208
so I'm just gonna
get to my IV.

662
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:12,910
We're almost done.

663
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,178
Now, same thing,
dried blood, big pull.

664
00:30:14,178 --> 00:30:15,178
One, two, three.

665
00:30:14,178 --> 00:30:15,512
One, two, three.

666
00:30:15,512 --> 00:30:18,649
That's it, that's it.

667
00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:20,649
Right here.

668
00:30:29,126 --> 00:30:30,530
Hey.

669
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,000
Hey.

670
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,402
Was I asleep?

671
00:30:38,402 --> 00:30:40,204
Yeah.

672
00:30:40,204 --> 00:30:41,981
A good two hours.

673
00:30:50,981 --> 00:30:52,983
You need a haircut.

674
00:30:52,983 --> 00:30:54,983
No shit.

675
00:30:52,983 --> 00:30:54,287
Mmm-hmm.

676
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:58,155
You need to wash it.

677
00:30:58,155 --> 00:30:59,155
No.

678
00:30:58,155 --> 00:30:59,557
Yes.

679
00:31:00,557 --> 00:31:02,557
No.

680
00:31:00,557 --> 00:31:02,226
Yes.

681
00:31:02,226 --> 00:31:03,037
Still smells like...

682
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,508
You should have seen
the sign I made for ya.

683
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:18,179
What'd it say?

684
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:25,318
Had, like, 3D letters
and everything.

685
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:29,153
Hey.

686
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:31,591
I'm sorry.

687
00:31:34,591 --> 00:31:36,462
I'm sorry.

688
00:31:38,462 --> 00:31:40,197
Don't say that.

689
00:31:40,197 --> 00:31:42,197
I'm so sorry.

690
00:31:40,197 --> 00:31:42,001
Hey.

691
00:31:45,001 --> 00:31:46,349
Don't say that.

692
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:00,192
You don't owe me anything.

693
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,760
Yes! Yes!

694
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:18,503
What's that?

695
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,644
I don't know.

696
00:32:27,644 --> 00:32:29,051
Maybe they caught
the other guy.

697
00:32:35,051 --> 00:32:37,057
Bye, Jeff.
We're so proud of you.

698
00:32:40,057 --> 00:32:41,325
<i>...hours ago</i>

699
00:32:41,325 --> 00:32:43,527
<i> now seems to be finally over.</i>

700
00:32:43,527 --> 00:32:45,596
<i> The last suspect
being searched for, police...</i>

701
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:47,364
<i> According to
Boston Police Department...</i>

702
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:16,527
It's nice
they turned out for ya.

703
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,662
I think... I think he wants
to do it himself.

704
00:33:18,662 --> 00:33:20,464
Yeah, okay.

705
00:33:20,464 --> 00:33:21,565
I'm gonna lock you off,
honey. I'll lock you off.

706
00:33:21,565 --> 00:33:23,834
Hold on. Okay.

707
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:25,235
You just let me know
if you wanna...

708
00:33:25,235 --> 00:33:27,171
Thanks, Kevin. Thanks.

709
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,539
Take a picture
with Erin for us.

710
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,441
You look great.
You did that great.

711
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:31,742
Does it feel good
to be going home?

712
00:33:31,742 --> 00:33:32,609
Is Carlos Arrendondo

713
00:33:32,609 --> 00:33:34,445
your guardian angel?

714
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:35,746
They hated each other

715
00:33:35,746 --> 00:33:38,248
and that's why
Pete got busted for it.

716
00:33:38,248 --> 00:33:40,184
'Cause Bob was using
his computer.

717
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,119
And Pete didn't rat him out.

718
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:44,188
And he... He almost
had to go to jail for that.

719
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,556
It was in the papers
and all that.

720
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:47,556
Hey, listen, look at this.

721
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:47,424
Hey.

722
00:33:47,424 --> 00:33:48,859
Ain't that somethin'?

723
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:50,859
Oh, my...

724
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:50,294
Both sides.

725
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:51,462
"Boston Strong."

726
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:52,596
Let... We gotta wave.

727
00:33:52,596 --> 00:33:53,831
What does
that even mean?

728
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:54,831
Wave.

729
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:54,798
You're a national

730
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:56,266
fuckin' hero, kiddo.

731
00:33:56,266 --> 00:33:57,401
You wave, Jeff.

732
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,204
They're all out for ya.

733
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,572
You're a real hero.

734
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:03,173
Isn't that somethin'?

735
00:34:03,173 --> 00:34:04,475
And it's just the start.

736
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:05,709
That's really somethin'.

737
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:07,411
I'm a hero
for standin' there

738
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:10,280
and getting my legs blown off?

739
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,748
Yeah,
what are ya talkin' about?

740
00:34:11,748 --> 00:34:13,617
That's the HOV for
electric vehicles and whatnot.

741
00:34:13,617 --> 00:34:16,286
No, it... Like for, uh,
just for handicap cars.

742
00:34:16,286 --> 00:34:19,156
No, no, there's no
handicap drivin' lanes.

743
00:34:19,156 --> 00:34:20,691
Jesus, what a bunch of morons.

744
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:22,326
Okay, we're fuckin' morons,

745
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:23,727
'cause we care about
people with disabilities?

746
00:34:23,727 --> 00:34:25,129
Oh, oh,
Jeff, Jeff! He's here.

747
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:26,129
Fuck you.

748
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:26,296
Here we go.

749
00:34:26,296 --> 00:34:27,296
All right, let's do this.

750
00:34:26,296 --> 00:34:27,197
Yes!

751
00:34:27,197 --> 00:34:28,332
Come on.

752
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:29,433
Look out.

753
00:34:29,433 --> 00:34:30,169
Hey.

754
00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:34,471
I got this back there.

755
00:34:34,471 --> 00:34:36,308
Oh, shit, don't pull it.

756
00:34:38,308 --> 00:34:39,877
Okay, got it, buddy?

757
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:42,346
Got the back?
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

758
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:45,749
Patty, I still think
Jeffie could live with me.

759
00:34:45,749 --> 00:34:48,652
Oh, yeah, all the way
up there in Cow-Hampshire.

760
00:34:48,652 --> 00:34:50,654
All his friends are here,
ya idiot.

761
00:34:50,654 --> 00:34:52,356
All due respect,
I got more room
than all of yas.

762
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:54,658
And I'm the only one
with a credit score above 520.

763
00:34:54,658 --> 00:34:55,859
I'm the one got a pool.

764
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:57,494
Above fucking ground!

765
00:35:01,231 --> 00:35:02,399
Oh, careful, careful.

766
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:04,535
Ow!

767
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:05,869
For God's sakes!

768
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:08,605
Jesus! My shin splints.

769
00:35:08,605 --> 00:35:09,907
God. You're gonna have to get

770
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:11,408
a place with a ramp
or an elevator.

771
00:35:11,408 --> 00:35:13,544
We're all gonna end up
in a fuckin' wheelchair.

772
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:15,379
Just tryin'
to take it real lightly.

773
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:17,514
He's home!
That's all that matters.

774
00:35:17,514 --> 00:35:19,514
God, I got a lot to do and...

775
00:35:17,514 --> 00:35:19,249
So psyched.

776
00:35:19,249 --> 00:35:20,817
God.

777
00:35:20,817 --> 00:35:22,619
Oh, my God, I thought it was
gonna be better than this.

778
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:24,619
Yeah, look at this, huh?

779
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:24,254
Where's Jeffie?

780
00:35:24,254 --> 00:35:25,254
Oh, Jeff. You okay?

781
00:35:24,254 --> 00:35:25,489
Hey, there he is.

782
00:35:25,489 --> 00:35:26,690
All right. This is it.

783
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:27,958
This is it. Welcome home!

784
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:29,726
Is it good to be back?

785
00:35:29,726 --> 00:35:32,362
Oh, my God, it's a little
crazy at the moment,

786
00:35:32,362 --> 00:35:35,199
because people, you know,
they send you these...

787
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:37,367
This stuff...
It's, uh, every day.

00:35:37,367 --> 00:35:38,367
It's, like, packages.

From all over the world!

790
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:40,804
Packages all
over the place.

791
00:35:40,804 --> 00:35:44,374
Ya gonna have to look at some
of these, son, at some point.

792
00:35:44,374 --> 00:35:46,210
That and toys and packages.

793
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,911

00:35:47,911 --> 00:35:49,446

Oh, can he drink yet?

806
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:07,999
'Course he can drink.
Didn't cut his balls off.

807
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:11,635

00:38:13,423 --> 00:38:14,592
You wanna close that?

840
00:38:15,592 --> 00:38:17,061
Do you want me to close it?

841
00:38:18,061 --> 00:38:19,909

You sure?

848
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,859
Call me
if you need me, okay?

849
00:39:49,886 --> 00:39:51,488
I don't need a doctor.

850
00:39:51,488 --> 00:39:53,156
Oh,
shut the fuck up, Bob.

851
00:40:16,746 --> 00:40:17,014
What time is it?

852
00:40:18,014 --> 00:40:18,014
You know what time it is,

853
00:40:18,882 --> 00:40:20,050
and we have to be going.

854
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,054
Jeffrey?

855
00:40:25,054 --> 00:40:26,054
Jeffrey, good morning.

856
00:40:28,191 --> 00:40:29,027
Jeffrey, are you awake?

857
00:40:31,027 --> 00:40:32,963
Gonna be late for rehab.

858
00:40:35,999 --> 00:40:37,999
Come on.

859
00:40:38,802 --> 00:40:41,538
No, I'm up. No, I'm up, Ma.

860
00:40:41,538 --> 00:40:44,875
Oh. Okay. All right.
I think he's...

861
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:47,043
I got my coat.
I... I'm wearing my coat.

862
00:40:47,043 --> 00:40:48,211
This is what I'm wearing.

863
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:53,984
What the hell was that?

864
00:40:55,919 --> 00:40:57,052
Fuck.

865
00:40:57,052 --> 00:40:59,088
Jeffrey?

866
00:40:59,088 --> 00:41:00,957
Sweetie, Jeffrey,
are you okay?

867
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:04,893
I hear it.

868
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:04,194
Shh!

869
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,731
Jeffrey! Just tell me
you're okay, baby.

870
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:09,731
I don't know what he's doing.

871
00:41:09,065 --> 00:41:10,700
What do you think is going on?

872
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,935
Jesus, Patty, what do you
think boys do in their room

873
00:41:11,935 --> 00:41:13,935
when they lock their door?

874
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,770
Yeah, I think
he's doin' it.

875
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,672
You think he...

876
00:41:15,672 --> 00:41:17,307
The kid's got no legs
and he's blowin' loads.

877
00:41:17,307 --> 00:41:19,143
Dirty fucking...

878
00:41:20,143 --> 00:41:21,012
Jeffrey?

879
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:25,682
It's gonna be
very special, Jeffie.

880
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,252
Everybody wants to see ya.

881
00:41:29,252 --> 00:41:31,154
See how good you're doin'.

882
00:41:31,154 --> 00:41:32,622
I just wish you would have

883
00:41:32,622 --> 00:41:33,857
let somebody
cut your freakin' hair.

884
00:41:33,857 --> 00:41:35,191
Oh,
stop pickin' on him.

885
00:41:35,191 --> 00:41:36,793
It's gonna be good.

886
00:41:36,793 --> 00:41:37,861
Hello.

887
00:41:37,861 --> 00:41:39,094

painful rehabilitation,</i>

899
00:42:03,052 --> 00:42:04,854

900
00:42:04,854 --> 00:42:06,854
Erin, come here!

Jeff's on TV!

904
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:09,158
My Jeff?

905
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:09,859
Come here.

906

00:42:12,762 --> 00:42:14,998
<i> here at Spaulding Hospital.</i>

909
00:42:14,998 --> 00:42:17,200
<i> That something is called hope.</i>

910
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,336
<i> In the days following
the Marathon bombing,</i>

911
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:22,939
<i> this photograph
showed the carnage
at the finish line.</i>

912
00:42:22,939 --> 00:42:25,375
<i> Jeff Bauman was standing
next to one of the bombs</i>

913
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:28,244
<i> when it detonated,
obliterating his legs.</i>

914
00:42:28,244 --> 00:42:30,113
<i> A day later,
from his hospital bed,</i>

915
00:42:30,113 --> 00:42:31,781
<i> Bauman scribbled a note.</i>

916
00:42:31,781 --> 00:42:33,717
<i> "I know what happened."</i>

917
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:34,884
<i> He's a real hero, my son.</i>

918
00:42:34,884 --> 00:42:36,020
<i> He's helpin' this city heal.</i>

919
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,321
<i> Be Boston Strong.</i>

920
00:42:38,321 --> 00:42:39,723
<i>Is that true, Jeff?</i>

921
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:40,897
<i> Are you Boston Strong?</i>

922
00:42:47,897 --> 00:42:50,171
<i>You did
real good today, kiddo.</i>

923
00:42:55,171 --> 00:42:57,741
That kind of exposure,
you know...

924
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,910
That could lead
to opportunities.

925
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:04,148
Make things, you know,

926
00:43:05,148 --> 00:43:06,985
easier for ya...

927
00:43:08,985 --> 00:43:10,985
Yeah.

928
00:43:08,985 --> 00:43:10,122
...down the line.

929
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:15,191
You got a call from Carlos.

930
00:43:15,191 --> 00:43:17,961
He wants to visit with ya.

931
00:43:17,961 --> 00:43:19,706
<i> And we should
be thankful for him.</i>

932
00:43:48,992 --> 00:43:50,027
In here. Hey.

933
00:43:51,027 --> 00:43:52,195
Sir, how you doin'?

934
00:43:52,195 --> 00:43:53,195
Hi. How are you?

935
00:43:52,195 --> 00:43:53,396
Paul Martino.

936
00:43:53,396 --> 00:43:55,396
How are you, Paul?

937
00:43:53,396 --> 00:43:55,231
Nice to meet you.

938
00:43:55,231 --> 00:43:57,099
Uh, casts shouldn't
take more than...

939
00:43:57,099 --> 00:43:58,099
Hour, hour and a half.

940
00:43:57,099 --> 00:43:58,435
Okay.

941
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:00,804
Cast is a very
quick procedure,

942
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,739
but it's
the most important part.

943
00:44:02,739 --> 00:44:04,808
If we get
a good impression of you,

944
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:07,977
then the rest of the procedure
is gonna go nicely.

945
00:44:07,977 --> 00:44:09,977
You okay?

946
00:44:07,977 --> 00:44:09,479
Yeah.

947
00:44:09,479 --> 00:44:11,347
We're gonna start
on this side, okay?

948
00:44:11,347 --> 00:44:14,217
We're gonna slip a sock
on you here.

949
00:44:14,217 --> 00:44:16,252
It's just
a cotton stocking that...

950
00:44:16,252 --> 00:44:18,822
This is so that when
we wrap the plaster on you,

951
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,090
it doesn't stick
directly to your skin.

952
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:22,459
D'you hear the one

953
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:24,427
where the farmer
was paintin' his bathroom?

954
00:44:24,427 --> 00:44:26,030
Figured he'd shellac
the toilet seat,

955
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:29,933
make it look prettier.
He didn't tell his wife.

956
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:31,301
Daughter says,
"What's the matter, Dad?

957
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:32,001
Ain't you ever seen
one of these before?"

958
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:35,105
He says, "Yeah, I just never
saw anybody frame it."

959
00:44:39,375 --> 00:44:41,845
Sorry, sorry.
Sorry, Jeff.

960
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,146
Don't make him
laugh too hard.

961
00:44:43,146 --> 00:44:44,481
...allow this to get hard.

962
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:45,014
And then we're gonna
make a slice in it.

963
00:44:46,014 --> 00:44:48,318
We're gonna take it
right off you, okay?

964
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:51,287
Maybe you could, uh,
use your new legs

965
00:44:51,287 --> 00:44:53,757
for next week
at the Bruins game, huh?

966
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:55,258
Ma, that's, like,
in a week.

967
00:44:55,258 --> 00:44:57,393
Give me
a couple of weeks

968
00:44:57,393 --> 00:44:58,762
of fabrication and delivery.

969
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:00,130
Get outta here.

970
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,264
Couple of weeks, Jeff,
you'll be up.

971
00:45:01,264 --> 00:45:02,499
I can't wait.

972
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:03,867
We can get you up
any time.

973
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,168
We're gonna clean up this side

974
00:45:05,168 --> 00:45:06,369
and then we'll go on
and do the right.

975
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:07,804
We'll be just as quick and...

976
00:45:07,804 --> 00:45:08,005
I wanna have it signed.

977
00:45:09,005 --> 00:45:10,005
Less pain. Okay...

978
00:45:09,005 --> 00:45:10,406
Yeah, yeah.

979
00:45:10,406 --> 00:45:12,142
...but at least you know
what to expect.

980
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:13,243
Right.

981
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:14,944
They've asked him
to go out

982
00:45:14,944 --> 00:45:16,212
on the ice and wave the flag.

983
00:45:19,949 --> 00:45:21,551
<i>Jonny Gomes
coming to the plate here</i>

984
00:45:21,551 --> 00:45:22,551
<i> for the Red Sox.</i>

985
00:45:21,551 --> 00:45:22,952
Go, Jonny!

986
00:45:22,952 --> 00:45:24,154
Get us a fuckin' hit.

987
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:25,555
<i>Be one to one now.</i>

988
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:27,490
Don't swing at that shit.
Let that shit go.

989
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:30,293
<i>Gomes
with a special bat in hand,</i>

990
00:45:30,293 --> 00:45:31,795
<i> to remember the victims</i>

991
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:33,795
<i> of the Marathon...</i>

992
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:33,797
Hey, Jeff!

993
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:37,267
You hear that?
His bat says "Boston Strong."

994
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:39,502
Hey, leave him be.
He's snappin' a deuce.

995
00:45:39,502 --> 00:45:41,502
No, no, no, no, no!

996
00:45:41,237 --> 00:45:42,505
God damn it.

997
00:45:42,505 --> 00:45:44,174
Not too good, huh?

998
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:45,809
No, he fouled up.

999
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:47,043
After everything
we've been through?

1000
00:45:47,043 --> 00:45:48,344
Haven't we suffered enough?

1001
00:45:48,344 --> 00:45:50,045
Hey, so is he gonna do it?

1002
00:45:50,045 --> 00:45:52,382
Oh, I dunno.
He's nervous.

1003
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:53,983
He's nervous about what?

1004
00:45:53,983 --> 00:45:55,351
Jeff, we heard
about the Bruins game!

1005
00:45:55,351 --> 00:45:56,853
Sounds pretty cool, bro.

1006
00:45:56,853 --> 00:45:57,587
They're gonna
give us box seats.

1007
00:45:57,587 --> 00:45:59,155
Wait, us?

1008
00:45:59,155 --> 00:46:00,490
Said we could
bring the whole crew.

1009
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:01,490
Yo, you gotta do this, Jeff!

1010
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:01,991
Free drinks!

1011
00:46:01,991 --> 00:46:03,293
Bruins need ya!

1012
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:04,527
Don't be a pussy, bro!

1013
00:46:04,527 --> 00:46:06,061
Shit. Ow!

1014
00:46:06,061 --> 00:46:07,130
What kinda food
they got?

1015
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:08,832
All-you-can-eat.

1016
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:10,366
It's all-you-can-eat,
Jeff. Come on, man...

1017
00:46:10,366 --> 00:46:11,835
Stop being selfish
about this shit.

1018
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:39,099
Is that my phone?

1019
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:45,401
Hello?

1020
00:46:45,401 --> 00:46:47,401
Smells delicious, Ma.

1021
00:46:45,401 --> 00:46:47,537
Thank you.

1022
00:46:47,537 --> 00:46:49,537
Dad, I'm gonna sit with you.

1023
00:46:47,537 --> 00:46:49,138
Sure.

1024
00:46:49,138 --> 00:46:52,308
<i>E-Money.
What're you doin'?</i>

1025
00:46:52,308 --> 00:46:53,444
Uh, talkin' to you.
What are you doin'?

1026
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:55,479
Dancin'.

1027
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,146
<i> Hey, let me just
step out of the club.</i>

1028
00:46:57,146 --> 00:46:58,146
What?

1029
00:46:57,146 --> 00:46:58,615
<i> Can you hear me now?</i>

1030
00:46:58,615 --> 00:47:00,884
Yeah, I can hear you.

1031
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:01,653
How you doin'?

1032
00:47:03,653 --> 00:47:04,189
Yeah, you know.

1033
00:47:06,189 --> 00:47:09,259
Hey, so I hope...

1034
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:11,895
I hope that I didn't
get ya at a bad time,

1035
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:14,063
but I, uh, you know,
it's the, uh,

1036
00:47:14,063 --> 00:47:16,933
<i> Bruins playoff game
against Chicago next week</i>

1037
00:47:16,933 --> 00:47:21,170
and they asked me
to come out there on the ice.

1038
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:22,672
On the ice?

1039
00:47:22,672 --> 00:47:24,674
Yeah, I'm not,
like, on the...
Not to play,

1040
00:47:24,674 --> 00:47:27,143
but, y'know,
to be the banner captain

1041
00:47:27,143 --> 00:47:28,645
and, like,
wave the flag and shit.

1042
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:31,314
<i> It's kind of like
singin' the national anthem,</i>

1043
00:47:31,314 --> 00:47:33,120
<i> but for people
who suck at singing.</i>

1044
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,955
You sure you wanna do that?

1045
00:47:38,955 --> 00:47:42,965
Well, everybody says I should.
It's the Stanley Cup, so...

1046
00:47:48,965 --> 00:47:52,439
<i> Listen, Erin, I... I know
we're not together, but...</i>

1047
00:47:56,439 --> 00:47:58,241
I was just, um...

1048
00:47:58,241 --> 00:48:00,209
I was wondering
if maybe you wanted

1049
00:48:00,209 --> 00:48:01,580
to come with me
and my family.

1050
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:08,284
<i> I don't think that
I could do it without you.</i>

1051
00:48:08,284 --> 00:48:10,553
And I know that it's
not really fair of me to say.

1052
00:48:10,553 --> 00:48:12,358
I'm really...
I'm sorry, um...

1053
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:16,993
But I...

1054
00:48:16,993 --> 00:48:18,298
I really need you right now.

1055
00:48:22,298 --> 00:48:24,032
<i> And, uh, please.</i>

1056
00:48:24,032 --> 00:48:25,074
Okay. Yeah.

1057
00:48:32,074 --> 00:48:33,710
<i>During tonight's warm-up,</i>

1058
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:36,346

00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:42,418
all over the news last night.

1062
00:48:42,418 --> 00:48:44,520
Jeff, he told the story
and I was fuckin' bawlin'.

1063
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,520
You all right?

1064
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,189
Yeah...

1065
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:47,523
Gonna squeeze through
and get outta your way...

Mom's way here.

1067
00:48:47,523 --> 00:48:49,426
Oh, thank you.

1068
00:48:50,426 --> 00:48:52,996
Let's go, Boston!

1069
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:54,998
All right!

1070
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:56,735
Okay,
a toast, a toast!

1071
00:48:58,735 --> 00:48:59,003
You cool?

1072
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:01,607
Yeah, I'm good.

1073
00:49:04,607 --> 00:49:07,510
Know why they
call Chicago the Windy City?

1074
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:08,778
'Cause you guys blow!

1075
00:49:08,778 --> 00:49:10,778
Do you have a smoke?

1076
00:49:08,778 --> 00:49:10,513
Oh, oh.

1077
00:49:10,513 --> 00:49:14,450
Jeff, we'd like to, uh,
stage you sooner.

1078
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:15,450
Oh, yeah.

1079
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:15,551
If that's all right.

1080
00:49:15,551 --> 00:49:16,551
Yeah, yeah.

1081
00:49:15,551 --> 00:49:16,688
Okay.

1082
00:49:18,688 --> 00:49:20,556
Okay. All right.

1083
00:49:20,556 --> 00:49:22,556
Let's do this!

1084
00:49:20,556 --> 00:49:22,392
They're goin' now!

1085
00:49:28,631 --> 00:49:30,199
<i>And now...</i>

1086
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:58,628
Ooh,
big crowd out there.

1087
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:00,268
Completely full tonight.

1088
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:06,671
Hey, don't be nervous.

1089
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:18,114
How are you doin', Jeff?

1090
00:50:18,114 --> 00:50:19,114
Yeah, I'm great.

1091
00:50:18,114 --> 00:50:19,615
You okay?

1092
00:50:19,615 --> 00:50:21,250
Great. Just stop here.

1093
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:23,250
I'm gonna get the flag.

1094
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:23,554
Thanks.

1095
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:26,255
Here's the flag, Jeff.

1096
00:50:26,255 --> 00:50:28,391
I'm gonna be standin'
right over there,

1097
00:50:28,391 --> 00:50:31,160
and then I'm gonna signal you
when to come out, okay?

1098
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,160
All right? Have fun.

1099
00:50:32,361 --> 00:50:34,630
Have fun, okay? Get pumped.

1100
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:41,139
Uh...

1101
00:50:43,139 --> 00:50:45,308
I don't think
I can do this, E.

1102
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:47,376
Jeff, look,
it's gonna be okay.

1103
00:50:47,376 --> 00:50:50,780
You just wave the flag.
And then you leave. Right?

1104
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:53,316
Okay, Jeff, that's
your cue. Get out there.

1105
00:50:56,519 --> 00:50:59,388
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1106
00:50:59,388 --> 00:51:05,463
<i> Welcome to TD Garden and
game two of the NHL playoffs.</i>

1107
00:51:07,463 --> 00:51:10,600
<i> Please give
a warm Boston welcome</i>

1108
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,904
<i> to tonight's honorary
fan banner captain,</i>

1109
00:51:14,904 --> 00:51:19,904
<i> Jeff Bauman!</i>

1110
00:51:19,208 --> 00:51:22,211
<i> Jeff's continued strength
and perseverance</i>

1111
00:51:22,211 --> 00:51:26,682
<i> in the face of adversity
represents all that is...</i>

1112
00:51:26,682 --> 00:51:30,686
<i> Boston Strong!</i>

1113
00:51:55,778 --> 00:51:57,914
Go, Jeffrey!

1114
00:51:57,914 --> 00:51:59,248
Whoo!

1115
00:52:17,266 --> 00:52:18,436
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

1116
00:52:57,773 --> 00:52:59,009
Get away from me.
Get the fuck away from me.

1117
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:01,009
Jeff...

1118
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:01,510
Get away from me.

1119
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:02,979
Get away from me!

1120
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:04,615
You stay calm.

1121
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:07,416
You stay calm,
you help somebody else.

1122
00:53:07,416 --> 00:53:08,651
Babe.

1123
00:53:08,651 --> 00:53:10,651
Hey. What...

1124
00:53:08,651 --> 00:53:10,553
Get away from me!

1125
00:53:10,553 --> 00:53:12,553
Jeff!

1126
00:53:10,553 --> 00:53:12,555
Get the fuck away from me.

1127
00:53:12,555 --> 00:53:14,557
Go help somebody else!

1128
00:53:14,557 --> 00:53:16,360
Go help somebody else!

1129
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,862
You stay calm!

1130
00:53:19,862 --> 00:53:21,269
You stay calm!

1131
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:29,874
You stay calm
and go help somebody else.

1132
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:24,433
I'm sorry.

1133
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,837
You need to tell your family
what's going on with you.

1134
00:54:34,837 --> 00:54:36,605
No, no.

1135
00:54:36,605 --> 00:54:39,745
Believe me, it's better
if they don't know. Trust me.

1136
00:54:42,745 --> 00:54:44,921
They keep trying to make
a hero out of me.

1137
00:54:57,893 --> 00:54:58,632
Does it hurt?

1138
00:55:03,632 --> 00:55:04,471
No.

1139
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,874
I missed you.

1140
00:55:11,874 --> 00:55:13,068
I missed you, too.

1141
00:55:42,671 --> 00:55:45,842
I'm here, Jeff.
I'm here.

1142
00:55:46,842 --> 00:55:48,079
I'm here.

1143
00:57:50,032 --> 00:57:52,538
Did you have sex with my son?

1144
00:57:55,538 --> 00:57:56,310
Yeah.

1145
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:03,679
Don't you think...

1146
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:05,715
Shouldn't you
be leanin' on me?

1147
00:58:06,715 --> 00:58:08,050
Hmm?

1148
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:11,320
I wish you were leanin' on me.

1149
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,065
Just happy to be
sitting here with you.

1150
00:58:23,065 --> 00:58:26,835
<i>They are so futuristic,
aren't they, Jeffrey?</i>

1151
00:58:26,835 --> 00:58:29,238
What you have
is a Genium knee.

1152
00:58:29,238 --> 00:58:31,707
Genium is a microprocessing,

1153
00:58:31,707 --> 00:58:33,976
top-of-the-line,
high-tech knee.

1154
00:58:33,976 --> 00:58:37,246
Two carbon fiber sockets
with suction suspension.

1155
00:58:37,246 --> 00:58:39,047
Deep breath as you go up.

1156
00:58:39,047 --> 00:58:40,716
<i>And, like, you know,
you just gotta work, like,</i>

1157
00:58:40,716 --> 00:58:43,118
<i> you know, your core strength
and everything,</i>

1158
00:58:43,118 --> 00:58:44,720
<i> and then you gotta
stand up on 'em</i>

1159
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:45,988
<i> and get your balance right.</i>

1160
00:58:45,988 --> 00:58:47,690
<i> But they're like...
They have...</i>

1161
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:50,092
<i> They're like feet.
They are like feet and legs.</i>

1162
00:58:50,092 --> 00:58:51,760
And, like,
they're attached to shoes.

1163
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,861
Mmm-hmm.

1164
00:58:52,861 --> 00:58:53,297
And you can just, like...

1165
00:58:55,297 --> 00:58:56,899
Were they cool?

1166
00:58:56,899 --> 00:58:58,367
I'm gonna walk.

1167
00:58:58,367 --> 00:58:59,969
You know, I'm gonna walk
with you again someday.

1168
00:59:01,904 --> 00:59:03,904
Read them at the same time.

1169
00:59:01,904 --> 00:59:03,872
Go.

1170
00:59:03,872 --> 00:59:05,374
See if they link up.

1171
00:59:05,374 --> 00:59:06,374
"Determination is...

1172
00:59:05,374 --> 00:59:06,009
"Don't be hasty.

1173
00:59:07,009 --> 00:59:08,009
"...the wake-up call

1174
00:59:07,009 --> 00:59:08,611
"Prosperity will knock...

1175
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:09,611
"to the human will."

1176
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:09,278
"...on your door soon."

1177
00:59:09,278 --> 00:59:10,646
I didn't hear yours.

1178
00:59:10,646 --> 00:59:11,747
No, I didn't
hear yours either.

1179
00:59:11,747 --> 00:59:13,747
Okay.

1180
00:59:13,248 --> 00:59:14,248
I'm gonna get it.

1181
00:59:13,248 --> 00:59:14,850
All right, keep going.

1182
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:17,119
<i>I'm not gonna help you.</i>

1183
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,988
You have to eat them
to be real?

1184
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:20,189
That's, like, a super-loud...
You have a super-loud crunch.

1185
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:21,724
Arms up. Get those arms up.

1186
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,125
Do you wanna,
I don't know, like,

1187
00:59:23,125 --> 00:59:24,733
come live with me
or somethin'?

1188
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:31,401
You serious?

1189
00:59:32,401 --> 00:59:33,140
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

1190
00:59:40,309 --> 00:59:42,177
You have to tell Patty.

1191
00:59:42,177 --> 00:59:44,315
Yeah, I'll tell Patty today.

1192
00:59:46,315 --> 00:59:47,218
Okay.

1193
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:51,220
She's so hungover, she won't
even remember, all right?

1194
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:53,756
She won't remember.

1195
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:55,056
We'll be living there
for two weeks.

1196
00:59:55,056 --> 00:59:57,159
We gotta fuckin' celebrate.

1197
00:59:58,694 --> 00:00:00,164
Boston Strong!

1198
01:00:02,164 --> 01:00:04,166
Look at ya!

1199
01:00:06,301 --> 01:00:07,771
Boston Strong!

1200
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,173
Jesus Christ. Oh, God.

1201
01:00:11,173 --> 01:00:12,675
Can you believe this shit?

1202
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:14,777
We needed a win, Bob.
We needed a win.

1203
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:17,246
How we supposed to
not take this personally?

1204
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:18,714
Hey, you got
a leaf in your drink.

1205
01:00:18,714 --> 01:00:20,049
It's a mint leaf.

1206
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:22,049
A mint, huh?

1207
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:22,083
It's a mojito.

1208
01:00:22,083 --> 01:00:23,452
You muddle
the lime and the mint.

1209
01:00:23,452 --> 01:00:25,921
You add sugar and ice

1210
01:00:25,921 --> 01:00:27,790
and you pour
over rum, soda water.

1211
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,191
You "muddle" it?

1212
01:00:29,191 --> 01:00:30,426
Yes, you muddle
the lime and the mint

1213
01:00:30,426 --> 01:00:32,261
and then you add
the sugar and ice.

1214
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:33,762
Hey, when we gonna
hear this big announcement?

1215
01:00:33,762 --> 01:00:34,963
Yes, just tell us already.

1216
01:00:34,963 --> 01:00:35,065
Oh,
when the game's over.

1217
01:00:37,065 --> 01:00:38,065
Hey.

1218
01:00:37,065 --> 01:00:38,400
Hey.

1219
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,968
Hey, so, Dale,
I need two burgers ready.

1220
01:00:39,968 --> 01:00:41,203
Um, you take that down,
that would be helpful.

1221
01:00:41,203 --> 01:00:42,871
Chips, too, if you don't mind.

1222
01:00:42,871 --> 01:00:44,173
Holy shit, you can taste
the mint, bro. Try that.

1223
01:00:44,173 --> 01:00:45,841
I'm happy
to make you guys one.

1224
01:00:45,841 --> 01:00:47,276
Yeah,
that'd be great, yeah, sure.

1225
01:00:47,276 --> 01:00:48,477
That's so nice
for having everybody over.

1226
01:00:48,477 --> 01:00:50,477
Three?

1227
01:00:48,477 --> 01:00:50,079
Hey, anybody that knows me

1228
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:51,880
knows I don't do
nothin' half-assed.

1229
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,081
Except high school.

1230
01:00:53,081 --> 01:00:54,383
Go fuck yourself, Bob.

1231
01:00:54,383 --> 01:00:55,784
Hey, Erin,
how are things at work?

1232
01:00:55,784 --> 01:00:57,352
You still at
Brigham and Women's?

1233
01:00:57,352 --> 01:00:59,722
No, no, I, um...
I actually gave them
my notice.

1234
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:01,722
Ya get fired?

1235
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:01,490
No, no...

1236
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:03,092
What's...
What's his guy's name?

1237
01:01:03,092 --> 01:01:05,094
We're just taking
some time, Jeff and I...

1238
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:06,094
I'm gonna be there...

1239
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:06,829
That's wonderful, honey.

1240
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,297
...through the therapy
and everything.

1241
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:09,297
Yeah.

1242
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:09,965
I'm moving in, actually.

1243
01:01:09,965 --> 01:01:11,965
Huh.

1244
01:01:09,965 --> 01:01:11,366
So, just to be around,

1245
01:01:11,366 --> 01:01:12,366
you know.

1246
01:01:11,366 --> 01:01:12,902
Wait, what?

1247
01:01:13,902 --> 01:01:14,438
Jeff told you.

1248
01:01:16,438 --> 01:01:17,840
You knew that.

1249
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,108
No.

1250
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:20,142
Jeff, you didn't
tell your mom?

1251
01:01:20,142 --> 01:01:22,142
Huh?

1252
01:01:20,142 --> 01:01:22,244
Jeff?

1253
01:01:22,244 --> 01:01:24,446
You didn't tell your mom
I was moving in?

1254
01:01:24,446 --> 01:01:27,116
I... I thought
that's what today was for.

1255
01:01:27,116 --> 01:01:30,122
Like, you know, uh,
announcements and shit.

1256
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:35,124
Very small apartment
for three people, Jeffrey.

1257
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:37,526
Yeah, but technically
it's only like two and a half.

1258
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:43,133
That ain't funny.

1259
01:01:44,133 --> 01:01:46,468
That ain't funny.

1260
01:01:46,468 --> 01:01:48,537
Oh, Patty, did you give
everyone the big news?

1261
01:01:48,537 --> 01:01:51,406
What? You told him
and you didn't tell us?

1262
01:01:51,406 --> 01:01:53,108
She didn't tell me shit.

1263
01:01:53,108 --> 01:01:54,843
I just knew there was
gonna be a big announcement.

1264
01:01:54,843 --> 01:01:56,843
Yeah, what's goin' on?

1265
01:01:54,843 --> 01:01:56,345
So, spill it already. Christ!

1266
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:58,914
All right, all right,
all right, okay. This is it.

1267
01:01:58,914 --> 01:01:59,914
Come on, get me up.

1268
01:01:58,914 --> 01:01:59,014
Patty.

1269
01:02:00,014 --> 01:02:01,784
Get me up.

1270
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:03,952
Okay, listen up,
this is how it's gonna be...

1271
01:02:03,952 --> 01:02:05,554
Fasten your seat belts.

1272
01:02:10,058 --> 01:02:11,226
Oprah's comin'.

1273
01:02:11,226 --> 01:02:13,195
Oh, my God!

1274
01:02:15,197 --> 01:02:16,431
Shut up!

1275
01:02:16,431 --> 01:02:20,102
Oprah called me!

1276
01:02:20,102 --> 01:02:23,305
She is flyin' down
to interview Jeffrey.

1277
01:02:23,305 --> 01:02:24,305
Day after tomorrow.

1278
01:02:23,305 --> 01:02:24,940
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

1279
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:26,175
You're gonna meet Stedman!

1280
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:27,175
Hey, man.

1281
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:27,876
No, no, no.

1282
01:02:27,876 --> 01:02:28,876
Oprah's fat ass...

1283
01:02:27,876 --> 01:02:28,977
Gayle! Oprah!

1284
01:02:28,977 --> 01:02:30,045
She's comin' to...

1285
01:02:30,045 --> 01:02:31,045
Patty. Patty.

1286
01:02:30,045 --> 01:02:31,580
What?

1287
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:33,081
Jeff's not doing
that stuff anymore.

1288
01:02:33,081 --> 01:02:34,483
What do you mean? Fuck.

1289
01:02:34,483 --> 01:02:35,483
Fuck off.

1290
01:02:34,483 --> 01:02:35,851
Uh-huh.

1291
01:02:35,851 --> 01:02:37,851
He's not.

1292
01:02:35,851 --> 01:02:37,386
Come on, it's Oprah.

1293
01:02:37,386 --> 01:02:39,121
He's not doing interviews.
He's not doin'...

1294
01:02:39,121 --> 01:02:40,121
Jeffrey?

1295
01:02:39,121 --> 01:02:40,455
...public appearances.

1296
01:02:40,455 --> 01:02:42,455
None of that.

1297
01:02:40,455 --> 01:02:42,056
Jeffrey, talk to me.

1298
01:02:42,056 --> 01:02:43,325
It's too much.

1299
01:02:43,325 --> 01:02:44,459
Jeffie.

1300
01:02:44,459 --> 01:02:45,994
It's not good for him.

1301
01:02:45,994 --> 01:02:47,994
It's too much, because...

1302
01:02:45,994 --> 01:02:47,462
Yeah, 'course.

1303
01:02:47,462 --> 01:02:49,462
It's fuckin' Oprah Winfrey.

1304
01:02:47,462 --> 01:02:49,131
He doesn't want...

1305
01:02:49,131 --> 01:02:50,532
She's the most famous
person in the world.

1306
01:02:50,532 --> 01:02:51,400
Patty, all those
people looking at him,

1307
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,901
asking him questions

1308
01:02:52,901 --> 01:02:53,901
and needing something.

1309
01:02:52,901 --> 01:02:53,936
Yeah, butt out.

1310
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:54,970
Come on, Jeffrey, talk to me.

1311
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:56,572
It's a lot of pressure.

1312
01:02:56,572 --> 01:02:58,240
And somebody's always tryin'
to take something from him.

1313
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,240
It's too much, Patty.

1314
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,474
You gonna let her do this

1315
01:02:59,474 --> 01:03:01,076
or you gonna tell me
for yourself?

1316
01:03:01,076 --> 01:03:02,477
I wanna hear from you.
You're not so drunk...

1317
01:03:02,477 --> 01:03:03,477
I'm speaking for him.

1318
01:03:02,477 --> 01:03:03,579
...ya can't speak to me.

1319
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:04,980
If you would
listen to me...

1320
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:06,621
No, you don't
speak for my son.

1321
01:03:12,621 --> 01:03:14,423
Why'd you... Why didn't
you tell me sooner?

1322
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:15,490
What?

1323
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:17,159
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

1324
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:18,894
Why do you think? I wanted
to make it a surprise.

1325
01:03:18,894 --> 01:03:21,964
I wanted a big announcement.
You know?

1326
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,098
It's Oprah Winfrey.

1327
01:03:23,098 --> 01:03:24,001
I'm sorry, Ma.

1328
01:03:27,001 --> 01:03:28,239
Where would I have
been without Oprah?

1329
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:31,907
She got me through
the bad times.

1330
01:03:31,907 --> 01:03:33,375
And I don't know where,
what I would be.

1331
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,543
I would've...
I would've hung myself

1332
01:03:34,543 --> 01:03:36,378
in the bathroom without Oprah.

1333
01:03:36,378 --> 01:03:37,248
Just sayin'.

1334
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:40,319
Just sayin'.

1335
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:46,555
So, hey,
if Oprah's your lifeline,

1336
01:03:46,555 --> 01:03:48,123
you got a lot
deeper issues, Patty.

1337
01:03:48,123 --> 01:03:49,123
I'm just sayin'.

1338
01:03:48,123 --> 01:03:49,191
Fuck you, Bob.

1339
01:03:49,191 --> 01:03:50,664
Shut up, Bob.

1340
01:03:55,664 --> 01:03:59,301
I just wanted people to see
how amazing my son is.

1341
01:03:59,301 --> 01:04:00,038
That's all.

1342
01:04:03,038 --> 01:04:04,419
What's so bad about that?

1343
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:21,023
Aw, E, come on.

1344
01:04:22,023 --> 01:04:23,926
Sorry.

1345
01:04:23,926 --> 01:04:25,926
E, come on, push it.

1346
01:04:23,926 --> 01:04:25,494
I am.

1347
01:04:25,494 --> 01:04:26,698
There ya go.

1348
01:04:29,698 --> 01:04:31,970
I got it.

1349
01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:36,970
Hey.

1350
01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:36,571
Oh, hey.

1351
01:04:36,571 --> 01:04:37,706
Oh, how you doin'?

1352
01:04:37,706 --> 01:04:39,708
Um, really well. How are you?

1353
01:04:39,708 --> 01:04:41,443
Sully bought me
a fuckin' sombrero.

1354
01:04:41,443 --> 01:04:42,443
I'm...

1355
01:04:41,443 --> 01:04:42,711
He did?

1356
01:04:42,711 --> 01:04:44,711
Yeah.

1357
01:04:42,711 --> 01:04:44,079
This is from him?

1358
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:45,314
Yeah, he said he was out

1359
01:04:45,314 --> 01:04:46,481
at a Mexican restaurant
last night, so...

1360
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:51,486
They got super hammered
and brought back two sombreros

1361
01:04:51,486 --> 01:04:52,988
and I got one of 'em.

1362
01:04:52,988 --> 01:04:54,988
Lucky.

1363
01:05:03,465 --> 01:05:05,465
One...

1364
01:05:03,465 --> 01:05:05,201
Two, three!

1365
01:05:07,269 --> 01:05:08,269
Oh, fuck.

1366
01:05:07,269 --> 01:05:08,238
Fuck.

1367
01:05:10,238 --> 01:05:11,740
Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?

1368
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:13,243
I'm sorry.

1369
01:05:15,243 --> 01:05:18,982
<i>♪ Let my love open the door</i>

1370
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:22,982

1371
01:05:24,486 --> 01:05:26,656

01:05:36,698 --> 01:05:38,633
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1377
01:05:40,168 --> 01:05:42,437
You listen
to this one, Jeffrey.

1378
01:05:42,437 --> 01:05:44,106
Listen to this.

1379
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:47,242
This is from Denver, Colorado.

1380
01:05:47,242 --> 01:05:52,314
"You...
I have never seen a stronger,

1381
01:05:52,314 --> 01:05:56,518
"more brilliant person
in my life."

1382
01:05:56,518 --> 01:05:58,085
Go to sleep, Ma.

1383
01:05:58,085 --> 01:05:59,788
"Thank you so much."

1384
01:05:59,788 --> 01:06:02,791
She's talkin' about you,
Jeffrey.

1385
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:04,393
Jeffrey?

1386
01:06:04,393 --> 01:06:07,662
She's talkin' about my son.

1387
01:06:07,662 --> 01:06:10,665
Hey, Jeffrey, we should go...
We should go to Colorado.

1388
01:06:10,665 --> 01:06:12,665
We should go to Denver.

1389
01:06:10,665 --> 01:06:12,267
Ma.

1390
01:06:12,267 --> 01:06:14,536
And go see those nice people.

1391
01:06:14,536 --> 01:06:17,272
I think we should
go to Denver, baby.

1392
01:06:17,272 --> 01:06:19,041
We should go to Denver
when you're better.

1393
01:06:20,041 --> 01:06:21,410
Just you and me, huh?

1394
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:23,678
Go to fuckin' sleep, Ma!

1395
01:06:23,678 --> 01:06:25,414
Oh, all right.

1396
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:27,115
Bye.

1397
01:06:27,115 --> 01:06:29,484
I don't wanna hear
any more of those letters.

1398
01:06:29,484 --> 01:06:32,087
Don't forget
about the Red Sox.

1399
01:06:32,087 --> 01:06:34,625
Want you to throw out
the first pitch.

1400
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:38,493
Look, I gotta tap out, boys.

1401
01:06:38,493 --> 01:06:39,828
I have rehab in the morning.

1402
01:06:39,828 --> 01:06:42,297
I don't want
the lady gettin' pissed.

1403
01:06:42,297 --> 01:06:43,432
Want some pills?

1404
01:06:43,432 --> 01:06:44,699
You fuckin' retarded, Sully?

1405
01:06:44,699 --> 01:06:46,168
I just told you,
I gotta get home.

1406
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:47,168
What are they?

1407
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:47,436
Not sure.

1408
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:49,070
Found 'em
on my sister's dresser.

1409
01:06:49,070 --> 01:06:50,839
You're either
gonna get high as fuck,

1410
01:06:50,839 --> 01:06:53,175
or they're gonna
regulate our periods.

1411
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:55,175
Pretty sure.

1412
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:58,580
Excuse me.
Are you Jeff Bauman?

1413
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:00,215
We have been
following your story

1414
01:07:00,215 --> 01:07:02,083
ever since we saw that photo.

1415
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:04,186
Then we saw you at the
Bruins game, wavin' the flag.

1416
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:05,754
It's so good
to see you're healed

1417
01:07:05,754 --> 01:07:07,456
and that you didn't
let them win.

1418
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:09,456
Can we take a picture?

1419
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:09,591
Yeah, sure.

1420
01:07:09,591 --> 01:07:11,591
Okay.

1421
01:07:09,591 --> 01:07:11,359
Who didn't I let win?

1422
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:12,362
The terrorists.

1423
01:07:14,362 --> 01:07:15,864
Can we... Yeah,
let's get a picture with him.

1424
01:07:15,864 --> 01:07:17,332
Oh, right, yeah.

1425
01:07:17,332 --> 01:07:19,332
Are you sure about that?

1426
01:07:17,332 --> 01:07:19,468
Yeah.

1427
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:21,336
'Cause I mean, like...

1428
01:07:21,336 --> 01:07:23,105
Where I'm sittin'...

1429
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:25,340
Y'know, looks like they at
least got on the scoreboard.

1430
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:26,741
Y'know,
I'm never gonna walk again.

1431
01:07:26,741 --> 01:07:28,376
Ooh!

1432
01:07:29,744 --> 01:07:31,580
All right. One more,
one more, one more.

1433
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,281
You don't get this picture,
I'm gonna fucking kill myself.

1434
01:07:33,281 --> 01:07:34,281
Just one more.

1435
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:37,252
Hey, Jeff!

1436
01:07:37,252 --> 01:07:38,887
God bless you.
Thank you, Jeff.

1437
01:07:38,887 --> 01:07:40,355
It was so nice to meet you.

1438
01:07:40,355 --> 01:07:41,556
Keep your stumps
together, though.

1439
01:07:41,556 --> 01:07:42,691
No. Come on,
give me some speed!

1440
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:43,758
Oh, watch it, I'll get him.

1441
01:07:43,758 --> 01:07:45,227
Get him higher, Sull.

1442
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:46,495
He's not gonna clear it.

1443
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:48,230
Fuckin' clear over
your fuckin' head!

1444
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:49,631
He won't fuckin'
clear me, Sull, get him up.

1445
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,631
Come on, get me up, Sull!

1446
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,499
Get him up, Sull!

1447
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:51,733
Here we go.

1448
01:07:51,733 --> 01:07:53,235
Use your arms, Sull,
use your arms!

1449
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:54,235
I think I'm gonna puke.

1450
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:54,636
Shut up!

1451
01:07:54,636 --> 01:07:56,636
It's great!

1452
01:07:54,636 --> 01:07:56,304
Please...

1453
01:07:56,304 --> 01:07:57,304
Shut the fuck...

1454
01:07:56,304 --> 01:07:57,772
Gets...

1455
01:07:57,772 --> 01:07:59,241
Oh, shit!

1456
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:01,143
Oh, shit!

1457
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:03,143
Fuck you, Bauman.

1458
01:08:03,378 --> 01:08:04,546
I spilled my beer.

1459
01:08:04,546 --> 01:08:06,148
Watch me do a flip.

1460
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:11,720
I give it a seven!

1461
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,720
Seven?

1462
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,421
I give it a seven!

1463
01:08:13,421 --> 01:08:15,157
Excuse me, excuse me!

1464
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:17,559
That was a six.
That's a generous six.

1465
01:08:17,559 --> 01:08:18,927
At most.

1466
01:08:18,927 --> 01:08:21,429
He didn't stick
the fucking landing, bro.

1467
01:08:21,429 --> 01:08:22,429
Oh!

1468
01:08:22,597 --> 01:08:23,832
Ouch.

1469
01:08:23,832 --> 01:08:25,934
A tour of their facility.

1470
01:08:25,934 --> 01:08:28,803
But I'm gonna get a...
Should get a medal.

1471
01:08:28,803 --> 01:08:30,806
I'm your fuckin' hero.

1472
01:08:31,806 --> 01:08:33,275
Why, thank you.

1473
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:34,809
You're welcome.

1474
01:08:34,809 --> 01:08:38,413
For finding the fucking
bombers, you piece of shit.

1475
01:08:38,413 --> 01:08:40,949
I should not be operating
machinery tonight.

1476
01:08:40,949 --> 01:08:42,817
Hey! Hey! Easy!

1477
01:08:44,586 --> 01:08:46,555
Shit, Sull. Ah!

1478
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:48,823
Sull, didn't you get
your license yanked
for driving drunk?

1479
01:08:48,823 --> 01:08:50,759
Didn't you blow, like, a .08?

1480
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:52,961
Better than who you blew
last week.

1481
01:08:52,961 --> 01:08:56,699
Hey! Hey.
Sull, no, you'll go to jail.

1482
01:08:57,699 --> 01:08:58,934
I'm just trying
to get you home

1483
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:00,969
before your fuckin' wife
kills us.

1484
01:09:00,969 --> 01:09:03,772
No, she's not my wife!
Give me the keys.

1485
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:05,473
Do you still even
got a license?

1486
01:09:05,473 --> 01:09:07,776
No, they don't lose...
You don't lose your license

1487
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:09,611
when you fuckin'
lose your legs. Dumbass.

1488
01:09:09,611 --> 01:09:11,846
How you gonna
reach the pedals?

1489
01:09:11,846 --> 01:09:14,749
Fuckin' get down there.
You gonna push 'em for me.

1490
01:09:14,749 --> 01:09:16,486
Is that even safe?

1491
01:09:18,486 --> 01:09:19,855
No.

1492
01:09:20,855 --> 01:09:21,892
Okay.

1493
01:09:23,892 --> 01:09:25,260
There you go, buddy.

1494
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:27,862
Get down there.

1495
01:09:27,862 --> 01:09:30,862
Hey! Watch... Watch the leg.

1496
01:09:27,862 --> 01:09:30,232
Sorry. Sorry.

1497
01:09:34,903 --> 01:09:36,738
Gas. Gas.

1498
01:09:36,738 --> 01:09:37,006
Gas.

1499
01:09:38,006 --> 01:09:39,507
Gas, gas, gas.

1500
01:09:39,507 --> 01:09:40,609
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1501
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:42,344
No!
Brake, brake, brake!

1502
01:09:44,546 --> 01:09:46,348
Got it? You got it?

1503
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:47,348
Yeah.

1504
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:47,382
Oh, shit.

1505
01:09:47,382 --> 01:09:49,382
You all right?

1506
01:09:47,382 --> 01:09:49,818
Shit.

1507
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:50,019
Fuckin' got it.

1508
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:54,024
I got it. Go.

1509
01:09:57,024 --> 01:09:59,494
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

1510
01:09:59,494 --> 01:10:00,632
Brake, brake, brake, brake!

1511
01:10:03,632 --> 01:10:04,833
Be my legs, Sull, let's go!

1512
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:06,501
All right. Be my legs.

1513
01:10:06,501 --> 01:10:07,802
Who the fuck's
pressin' the pedals, Jeff?

1514
01:10:07,802 --> 01:10:09,971
Go back to sleep,
you alcoholic!

1515
01:10:09,971 --> 01:10:11,673
Where is he? Oh, shit.

1516
01:10:11,673 --> 01:10:13,275
Sull, I said the pedals,
not my cock, buddy.

1517
01:10:13,275 --> 01:10:14,576
What are you
doing down there? Dude!

1518
01:10:14,576 --> 01:10:15,576
D, I got my legs back, D!

1519
01:10:14,576 --> 01:10:15,977
Whoo-hoo!

1520
01:10:15,977 --> 01:10:17,512
Brake pedal?

1521
01:10:17,512 --> 01:10:18,880
That was
some freakin' awesome...

1522
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,382
Let's go do donuts.
Jeff, let's do donuts.

1523
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:22,784
Brake pedal.
Whoa, Sully, shit!

1524
01:10:22,784 --> 01:10:23,918
You gotta stop! Stop!

1525
01:10:23,918 --> 01:10:24,986
Come on!

1526
01:10:24,986 --> 01:10:26,521
Don't be a pussy!

1527
01:10:26,521 --> 01:10:28,523
Don't let
the fuckin' terrorists win!

1528
01:10:28,523 --> 01:10:29,659
Brake pedal, gas pedal.

1529
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:31,793
Sull, gas, gas.

1530
01:10:31,793 --> 01:10:33,461
Whoa. Brake, brake,
brake.

1531
01:10:33,461 --> 01:10:34,863
Let's go.
No, go over the hill!

1532
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:37,064
Sull! Easy, easy,
easy on the gas.

1533
01:10:37,064 --> 01:10:38,533
Easy on the gas, bro.

1534
01:10:38,533 --> 01:10:39,834
Whoa, shit! Shit!

1535
01:10:41,369 --> 01:10:42,804
Police out.
Whoa! We need to stop.

1536
01:10:42,804 --> 01:10:44,306
<i>Pull the car over.</i>

1537
01:10:44,306 --> 01:10:45,540
There you go, Sull.

1538
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:47,540
Oh, shit.

1539
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:47,309
<i> Pull over now!</i>

1540
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:48,943
Brake, brake, brake,
Sully, brake, brake!

1541
01:10:48,943 --> 01:10:50,943
Brake pedal.

1542
01:10:50,612 --> 01:10:52,612
Whoa!

1543
01:10:50,612 --> 01:10:52,082
Hey!

1544
01:10:56,451 --> 01:10:57,585
Put up your hands!

1545
01:10:57,585 --> 01:10:59,421
Let me see your hands!

1546
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:00,357
Let me see your hands!

1547
01:11:02,357 --> 01:11:03,826
Roll your window down!

1548
01:11:04,826 --> 01:11:06,060
Roll down your fuckin' window!

1549
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:07,629
All right, okay,
sorry, all right.

1550
01:11:07,629 --> 01:11:08,863
Sull, you gotta get up, Sull.

1551
01:11:08,863 --> 01:11:09,702
Anybody else in that car?

1552
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:15,711
Let me see your hands,
too, pal!

1553
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:23,848
Hey, wait a minute.

1554
01:11:26,848 --> 01:11:28,752
You Jeff Bauman?

1555
01:11:30,752 --> 01:11:32,120
Yeah, yeah.

1556
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:33,122
What?

1557
01:11:34,122 --> 01:11:35,122
Yeah.

1558
01:11:34,122 --> 01:11:35,724
You are?

1559
01:11:35,724 --> 01:11:37,625
Yeah.

1560
01:11:37,625 --> 01:11:39,763
Can I get a picture with you?

1561
01:11:41,763 --> 01:11:43,898
<i>You, um,
put the sauce in too early,</i>

1562
01:11:43,898 --> 01:11:45,867
<i> it falls right to the bottom
of the cake.</i>

1563
01:11:45,867 --> 01:11:47,369
<i>Look at that. So soft.</i>

1564
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:48,470
<i>And if you put it in too late,</i>

1565
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:49,904
<i> it sits right at the top edge.</i>

1566
01:11:49,904 --> 01:11:51,706
<i>Oh, I love that.
That's a fun fact.</i>

1567
01:12:01,616 --> 01:12:02,586
You take your pill?

1568
01:12:06,054 --> 01:12:08,054
Did you take your medication?

1569
01:12:06,054 --> 01:12:08,991
No.

1570
01:12:09,991 --> 01:12:11,760
Jeff?

1571
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,760
No.

1572
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,495
Hello? What?

1573
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:14,495
No.

1574
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:14,929
No?

1575
01:12:14,929 --> 01:12:16,168
Could you take it, please?

1576
01:12:20,168 --> 01:12:22,637
Please, please, please.

1577
01:12:22,637 --> 01:12:24,907
Please? Pause it.

1578
01:12:25,907 --> 01:12:27,907
Pause?

1579
01:12:25,907 --> 01:12:27,642
No, keep going.

1580
01:12:27,642 --> 01:12:29,081
Hey, wasn't Patty supposed
to take you to rehab?

1581
01:12:33,081 --> 01:12:35,150
Pill packer.

1582
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:36,885
Wanna go in front
of all those people

1583
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:38,520
with the noise and the lights?

1584
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,087
You'll be there.

1585
01:12:40,087 --> 01:12:41,923
You don't even have
to be there, Erin, you know?

1586
01:12:41,923 --> 01:12:44,793
Jeff is goin' out
on the field with
the Carlos guy.

1587
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:46,761
It's why he's eatin' lunch
with him next week.

1588
01:12:46,761 --> 01:12:47,862
My God.

1589
01:12:47,862 --> 01:12:49,063
He's gonna
get to know him.

1590
01:12:49,063 --> 01:12:50,665
People think of them
as a team.

1591
01:12:50,665 --> 01:12:52,167
No, you think of us
as a team, Ma.

1592
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:54,769
No, the whole fuckin' world
thinks of you as a team.

1593
01:12:54,769 --> 01:12:56,769
It's not just me.

1594
01:12:54,769 --> 01:12:56,104
It's just weird.

1595
01:12:56,104 --> 01:12:57,739
I don't wanna meet him,
I told you.

1596
01:12:57,739 --> 01:12:59,739
Oh, Jesus, Jeff.

1597
01:12:57,739 --> 01:12:59,441
Hey, guys.

1598
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:00,942
God's sake, I made
the fuckin' reservation.

1599
01:13:00,942 --> 01:13:02,577
I don't wanna
meet Carlos.

1600
01:13:02,577 --> 01:13:03,945
I don't wanna relive
the worst day of my life.

1601
01:13:03,945 --> 01:13:05,447
We really have to be

1602
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:06,581
on time for these
appointments. Okay?

1603
01:13:06,581 --> 01:13:07,782
We got stuck in traffic.

1604
01:13:07,782 --> 01:13:09,451
Yeah,
she forgot the sleeves.

1605
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:10,652
She forgot the sleeves.

1606
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:11,955
You okay?

1607
01:13:13,955 --> 01:13:16,691
Let's get about
a 30-second count there, okay?

1608
01:13:16,691 --> 01:13:19,594
Just add a little more
strengthening to it, okay?

1609
01:13:19,594 --> 01:13:21,996
So let's start off
with the right arm,

1610
01:13:21,996 --> 01:13:24,199
left leg for a count of...

1611
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:27,002
One, two, three, four...

1612
01:13:28,002 --> 01:13:30,070
Remember, concentrate here
on the glutes.

1613
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:31,706
Don't arch your back.

1614
01:13:31,706 --> 01:13:33,107
This is the first time
you're in this week

1615
01:13:33,107 --> 01:13:34,109
and you have
three appointments.

1616
01:13:35,109 --> 01:13:36,811
Okay?

1617
01:13:36,811 --> 01:13:39,113
You gotta get in here
as many times as you can

1618
01:13:39,113 --> 01:13:40,113
for your appointments...

1619
01:13:39,113 --> 01:13:40,248
I know.

1620
01:13:40,248 --> 01:13:41,649
I keep tellin' 'em, y'know?

1621
01:13:41,649 --> 01:13:42,016
...or it's not gonna work,
okay?

1622
01:13:43,016 --> 01:13:44,986
You have to keep
your appointments

1623
01:13:44,986 --> 01:13:47,489
and you have to come in
ready to work.

1624
01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:50,225
I mean, look at everybody
around here, Jeff.

1625
01:13:50,225 --> 01:13:51,960
They're recovering because
they put the time

1626
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,795
and the energy into it.

1627
01:13:53,795 --> 01:13:56,265
And they make it a priority.
And you have to do that, too.

1628
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,535
Did you find
everything?

1629
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:35,169
Yeah.

1630
01:14:35,169 --> 01:14:36,905
Do you have a bathroom?

1631
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:38,279
We do.
It's right over in the corner.

1632
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:04,636
Jeff?

1633
01:15:08,636 --> 01:15:09,678
Jeff?

1634
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:31,364
Jeff.

1635
01:15:38,099 --> 01:15:39,836
Jeff.

1636
01:15:41,836 --> 01:15:43,836
Wake up.

1637
01:15:43,838 --> 01:15:45,007
Wake up.

1638
01:15:47,007 --> 01:15:48,979
You and Patty get hammered?

1639
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:53,265
Wake up.

1640
01:16:15,403 --> 01:16:17,403
Blanket?

1641
01:16:15,403 --> 01:16:17,740
Mmm-hmm.

1642
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:36,656
You want the board?

1643
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:36,334
Yeah.

1644
01:16:46,334 --> 01:16:48,775
Can I have my Gatorade?

1645
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:54,678
I got it.

1646
01:16:56,678 --> 01:16:58,913
Yeah,
he'll be helpin' the Red Sox.

1647
01:16:58,913 --> 01:17:00,882
It's his favorite team
since he was a little boy.

1648
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:02,150
Jeff's throwin' out
the first pitch

1649
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:03,785
isn't gonna help 'em win,
Patty.

1650
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:04,886
Bruins lost that game
that we went to.

1651
01:17:04,886 --> 01:17:06,387
Whoa!

1652
01:17:06,387 --> 01:17:08,156
Thought we said we weren't
gonna say that out loud.

1653
01:17:08,156 --> 01:17:10,091
You see,
the fact you say that, Erin,

1654
01:17:10,091 --> 01:17:13,294
shows how little
you know about baseball.

1655
01:17:13,294 --> 01:17:15,101
Are you...
Are you even from here?

1656
01:17:26,374 --> 01:17:27,374
Smart.

1657
01:17:26,374 --> 01:17:27,809
Okay.

1658
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:28,843
Huh? What?

1659
01:17:35,950 --> 01:17:37,950
How they feel? Good?

1660
01:17:35,950 --> 01:17:37,919
Yeah.

1661
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,122
All set?

1662
01:17:41,122 --> 01:17:42,757
All right, when you're ready,

1663
01:17:42,757 --> 01:17:46,227
you're gonna scooch ahead
before you stand up.

1664
01:17:46,227 --> 01:17:47,829
Okay, let me just
straighten that leg there.

1665
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:49,497
Mmm-hmm.

1666
01:17:53,234 --> 01:17:54,234
Yup.

1667
01:17:53,234 --> 01:17:54,471
Okay.

1668
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:57,872
Okay, scooch ahead.

1669
01:17:57,872 --> 01:17:59,974
Okay, got it.
I'm gonna get this.

1670
01:17:59,974 --> 01:18:04,746
Up. Hips back, hips back.
Chest up.

1671
01:18:04,746 --> 01:18:06,746
Chest up.

1672
01:18:04,746 --> 01:18:06,247
Jeffie. You're up!

1673
01:18:06,247 --> 01:18:08,416
Chest up, okay?
Chest up.

1674
01:18:08,416 --> 01:18:10,416
My God!

1675
01:18:08,416 --> 01:18:10,384
Chest up. Chest up.

1676
01:18:10,384 --> 01:18:12,386
Good, good. Okay? Good.

1677
01:18:12,386 --> 01:18:14,087
That's amazing. Wow.

1678
01:18:14,087 --> 01:18:15,223
You okay?

1679
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:16,457
God, you are so tall.

1680
01:18:16,457 --> 01:18:18,126
All right? Okay.

1681
01:18:18,126 --> 01:18:19,961
It's a little sore there.

1682
01:18:19,961 --> 01:18:21,061
Oh, my God.

1683
01:18:21,061 --> 01:18:22,296
Okay.

1684
01:18:22,296 --> 01:18:24,165
Nah, it's like needles
in my legs.

1685
01:18:24,165 --> 01:18:25,165
Okay.

1686
01:18:24,165 --> 01:18:25,433
Yeah,

1687
01:18:25,433 --> 01:18:27,433
but you look awesome.

1688
01:18:27,268 --> 01:18:28,936
Good job, Jeff.

1689
01:18:28,936 --> 01:18:31,439
Oh, you're amazing,
Jeffie. Looks amazing.

1690
01:18:31,439 --> 01:18:32,807
It's the first time.

1691
01:18:32,807 --> 01:18:33,007
Keep goin'. Keep goin'.

1692
01:18:34,007 --> 01:18:35,007
I can't, I can't.

1693
01:18:34,007 --> 01:18:35,977
Good job.

1694
01:18:35,977 --> 01:18:37,977
Let him sit.

1695
01:18:35,977 --> 01:18:37,278
I gotta sit down.

1696
01:18:37,278 --> 01:18:38,379
Okay, yup. Okay.

1697
01:18:39,413 --> 01:18:41,051
Good job. Good job.

1698
01:18:45,051 --> 01:18:47,155
Wheels, before... It's
gonna make it easier for ya.

1699
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:48,155
Ya lock the wheels first.

1700
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:48,890
I just... I did.

1701
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:50,890
E.

1702
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:50,091
And then ya pull up

1703
01:18:50,091 --> 01:18:51,091
the seat.

1704
01:18:50,091 --> 01:18:51,159
Hey, E,

1705
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:52,426
can you get my Gatorade?

1706
01:18:52,426 --> 01:18:53,861
I don't have it.

1707
01:18:53,861 --> 01:18:55,861
Ya didn't lock...

1708
01:18:53,861 --> 01:18:55,463
Fuckin'...

1709
01:18:55,463 --> 01:18:56,497
...the wheels, 'cause if you
did, it wouldn't be movin'.

1710
01:18:56,497 --> 01:18:57,565
No, you still haven't done it!

1711
01:18:57,565 --> 01:18:58,800
Would you back off?

1712
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,800
Oh, Patty!

1713
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,168
What?

1714
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:02,303
Jesus Christ,
I'm sick of this shit.

1715
01:19:02,303 --> 01:19:04,303
I'm sick of both of you.

1716
01:19:02,303 --> 01:19:04,572
What?

1717
01:19:04,572 --> 01:19:06,572
E, what the fuck? Calm down.

1718
01:19:04,572 --> 01:19:06,274
I'm tired of you

1719
01:19:06,274 --> 01:19:08,042
fuckin' talkin' to me like
I'm an idiot.

1720
01:19:08,042 --> 01:19:09,343
A child
is what you are.

1721
01:19:09,343 --> 01:19:10,878
Okay?
I am not an idiot, Patty.

1722
01:19:10,878 --> 01:19:12,878
Every time you open your...

1723
01:19:10,878 --> 01:19:12,280
Ma, cut it out.

1724
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,148
This is behavior
I've come to know and love.

1725
01:19:14,148 --> 01:19:15,449
Do you understand me?
Really, I can't...

1726
01:19:15,449 --> 01:19:17,083
I'm just callin' it
like it is.

1727
01:19:17,083 --> 01:19:19,083
I'm tired, Jeff, okay?

1728
01:19:17,083 --> 01:19:19,453
Everybody's tired!

1729
01:19:19,453 --> 01:19:21,087
This didn't
just happen to you.

1730
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:22,423
What do you mean,
it didn't just happen to me?

1731
01:19:22,423 --> 01:19:24,192
It did just happen to me!

1732
01:19:24,192 --> 01:19:26,160
Could you just open your eyes
for one fucking second,

1733
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:28,095
and acknowledge
the huge circle...

1734
01:19:28,095 --> 01:19:29,030
Look at me! Look at me!

1735
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:31,899
Jeff, the huge circle
of people

1736
01:19:31,899 --> 01:19:33,501
that have fucking
altered their lives

1737
01:19:33,501 --> 01:19:36,170
to orbit around you. Okay?

1738
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:37,939
You have no fucking idea
how much...

1739
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:39,974
You act like this is
fucking easy for him!

1740
01:19:39,974 --> 01:19:41,209
When do I act
like this is easy?

1741
01:19:41,209 --> 01:19:43,211
Last night,
he's fucking wasted

1742
01:19:43,211 --> 01:19:44,211
and covered in his own shit.

1743
01:19:43,211 --> 01:19:44,846
Hey...

1744
01:19:44,846 --> 01:19:46,113
And I have to clean him up.

1745
01:19:46,113 --> 01:19:47,348
And nobody else is there
helping me.

1746
01:19:47,348 --> 01:19:48,850
Oh, it's my fault?

1747
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:50,151
I have to carry him
to the bed.

1748
01:19:50,151 --> 01:19:51,385
Can you not fucking say that
right now?

1749
01:19:51,385 --> 01:19:52,385
What?

1750
01:19:51,385 --> 01:19:52,954
Can you not talk

1751
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:54,954
about that right now?

1752
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:54,288
People are watching!

1753
01:19:54,288 --> 01:19:56,123
I don't give a fuck.
I don't give a shit.

1754
01:19:56,123 --> 01:19:58,626
Well, maybe they don't teach
you manners in Amesbury, huh?

1755
01:19:58,626 --> 01:20:01,229
You say one more fucking thing
about Amesbury, Patty,

1756
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:02,930
I'll punch you in the fucking
face, you understand?

1757
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:05,930
Don't you threaten me.

1758
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:05,233
Get in the car!

1759
01:20:05,233 --> 01:20:06,634
Go. Get in the car.

1760
01:20:06,634 --> 01:20:08,369
You gonna let her
talk to me this way?

1761
01:20:08,369 --> 01:20:11,143
You just fuckin' walk away.
You're not on the team.

1762
01:20:16,143 --> 01:20:17,011
So you gonna
tell me what's goin' on?

1763
01:20:18,011 --> 01:20:20,248
Uh, stress, lack of sleep,

1764
01:20:20,248 --> 01:20:23,150
uh, minor surgeries,
fittings for his legs.

1765
01:20:23,150 --> 01:20:24,385
Okay.

1766
01:20:24,385 --> 01:20:25,620
Physical therapy sessions.

1767
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:27,087
His mom yelling at me

1768
01:20:27,087 --> 01:20:28,389
for every fuckin' thing
I have ever done.

1769
01:20:28,389 --> 01:20:30,291
I knew this was gonna happen.

1770
01:20:30,291 --> 01:20:32,027
This is what you do,
you just take on too much.

1771
01:20:33,027 --> 01:20:34,228
You take on
other people's problems

1772
01:20:34,228 --> 01:20:35,398
and you forget yourself.

1773
01:20:37,398 --> 01:20:40,501
Uh, what the fuck is this?

1774
01:20:42,203 --> 01:20:44,105
Did... Please tell me
you found this in a dumpster

1775
01:20:44,105 --> 01:20:45,541
and you're playing
some prank on me.

1776
01:20:47,541 --> 01:20:50,444
I'm just kidding.
Okay. Uh... Fuck.

1777
01:20:50,444 --> 01:20:51,545
Um, how long?

1778
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:54,386
Five weeks.

1779
01:20:58,386 --> 01:20:59,289
Does he know?

1780
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:02,691
No.

1781
01:21:03,691 --> 01:21:05,696
I'm tellin' him tonight.

1782
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:13,167
Here we go.

1783
01:21:13,167 --> 01:21:14,435
Yeah, so I saw...

1784
01:21:14,435 --> 01:21:16,170
Saw him on the news
again yesterday.

1785
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:19,040
That's good rotation
on that.

1786
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,675
It's like a shish kebab.

1787
01:21:20,675 --> 01:21:22,176
Burn that shit.

1788
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:23,511
Oh, yeah,
light that up.

1789
01:21:23,511 --> 01:21:26,180
Him and that...
That goddamn cowboy hat.

1790
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:27,682
It's a whole event, that hat.

1791
01:21:27,682 --> 01:21:29,250
He really wear
that thing in real life?

1792
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:30,451
You still talkin' about
that Mexican guy?

1793
01:21:30,451 --> 01:21:32,620
Costa Rican. Jesus, Bob,

1794
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:34,620
welcome to 1965, buddy.

1795
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:34,722
You know what I meant.

1796
01:21:34,722 --> 01:21:36,724
For God's sakes.

1797
01:21:36,724 --> 01:21:38,592
I tell ya what, I'd really
like to meet that guy.

1798
01:21:38,592 --> 01:21:40,594
Costa Rican, Mexican,
Honduran, whatever he is.

1799
01:21:40,594 --> 01:21:42,296
I don't care.

1800
01:21:42,296 --> 01:21:44,298
Why?

1801
01:21:44,298 --> 01:21:46,334
He's a fuckin' American hero,
Jeffie.

1802
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:47,735
Not for him,
you wouldn't be sittin' here

1803
01:21:47,735 --> 01:21:50,735
drinkin' beers on my tab.

1804
01:21:47,735 --> 01:21:50,070
Fuck that guy.

1805
01:21:50,070 --> 01:21:52,373
Come to think of it,
maybe he ought to pay.

1806
01:21:55,209 --> 01:21:56,744
Hey, Jeffie,
wasn't I supposed to take you

1807
01:21:56,744 --> 01:21:59,747
to pick up your girl,
like, 10 minutes ago?

1808
01:21:59,747 --> 01:22:01,515
Hey, you want...
Who wants another round?

1809
01:22:01,515 --> 01:22:03,653
I'll have one. Who's paying?

1810
01:22:05,653 --> 01:22:07,653
Who you think?

1811
01:22:05,653 --> 01:22:07,321
Not you.

1812
01:22:07,321 --> 01:22:08,456
Uncle Bob.

1813
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:27,009
Hey, can I just get

1814
01:22:28,009 --> 01:22:29,009
the check?

1815
01:22:28,009 --> 01:22:29,443
What's up?

1816
01:22:29,443 --> 01:22:30,443
Can I just get the check?

1817
01:22:29,443 --> 01:22:30,282
Oh, sure.

1818
01:22:35,282 --> 01:22:36,784
Yeah, four...
Four mai tais.

1819
01:22:36,784 --> 01:22:38,352
Give me an order
of fried rice

1820
01:22:38,352 --> 01:22:40,087
and some, uh, chicken wings.

1821
01:22:40,087 --> 01:22:41,029
Yeah, yeah.

1822
01:22:51,098 --> 01:22:53,268
I dunno.
I like pizza, too.

1823
01:22:54,268 --> 01:22:55,637
Don't forget my order.

1824
01:22:56,637 --> 01:23:00,274
Hey, you're the guy.
From the wheelchair.

1825
01:23:00,274 --> 01:23:01,542
One in the picture
with the guy

1826
01:23:01,542 --> 01:23:03,542
in the fuckin' cowboy hat?

1827
01:23:01,542 --> 01:23:03,310
Yeah.

1828
01:23:03,310 --> 01:23:05,310
Yeah.

1829
01:23:03,310 --> 01:23:05,046
Hey, that's awesome.

1830
01:23:05,046 --> 01:23:06,313
Hey, you know what?

1831
01:23:06,313 --> 01:23:08,516
Me and this
fuckin' handsome guy...

1832
01:23:08,516 --> 01:23:10,151
We work, like, 10 blocks away

1833
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:11,385
from where
the bombin' happened.

1834
01:23:11,385 --> 01:23:13,385
Yeah.

1835
01:23:11,385 --> 01:23:13,154
It's fuckin' crazy, right?

1836
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:14,622
Yeah, like, right there.

1837
01:23:14,622 --> 01:23:15,622
We were right there.

1838
01:23:14,622 --> 01:23:15,790
Right there.

1839
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:17,191
We saw
the whole fuckin' thing.

1840
01:23:17,191 --> 01:23:18,191
Hey, you know what, though?

1841
01:23:17,191 --> 01:23:18,559
No shit.

1842
01:23:18,559 --> 01:23:20,461
Let me ask you.
That whole thing,

1843
01:23:20,461 --> 01:23:22,461
it was a conspiracy, right?

1844
01:23:20,461 --> 01:23:22,430
Mai tais?

1845
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:23,664
The whole thing
was a hoax.

1846
01:23:23,664 --> 01:23:25,199
Yeah.

1847
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:26,834
It was like
a fuckin' false flag.

1848
01:23:26,834 --> 01:23:30,171
It was like it didn't happen.
It was all, like, bullshit.

1849
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:33,707
Fuckin' so Obama could
send us to war with Iran.

1850
01:23:33,707 --> 01:23:35,443
We're not gonna tell anybody.

1851
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:36,443
What?

1852
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:36,610
You...

1853
01:23:36,610 --> 01:23:38,446
You got paid
to do the bombing.

1854
01:23:38,446 --> 01:23:40,181
Fuckin' Obama
did this whole thing

1855
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:41,849
so we'd go to a war
with Iran, bro.

1856
01:23:41,849 --> 01:23:43,451
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1857
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:44,451
He's got a point.

1858
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:44,618
Hey, you know what?

1859
01:23:44,618 --> 01:23:45,853
We're already at war
with Iran,

1860
01:23:45,853 --> 01:23:47,853
you fuckin' douchebag.

1861
01:23:45,853 --> 01:23:47,488
Oh, yeah?

1862
01:23:47,488 --> 01:23:49,488
Ooh.

1863
01:23:47,488 --> 01:23:49,090
Fuckin' douchebag?

1864
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:51,090
The fuck you talkin' about?

1865
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:51,192
Fuck you.

1866
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:53,327
This guy's
fuckin' phony-baloney.

1867
01:23:53,327 --> 01:23:54,327
Easy, easy...

1868
01:23:53,327 --> 01:23:54,595
Phony-baloney.

1869
01:23:54,595 --> 01:23:55,863
Fuck you!

1870
01:23:55,863 --> 01:23:57,698
Hey, come on, man!
Say, take it easy.

1871
01:23:57,698 --> 01:23:59,600
You fuckin' make pizza,
you piece of shit.

1872
01:24:02,736 --> 01:24:04,338
Fuck you, man.

1873
01:24:04,338 --> 01:24:06,340
You're fuckin' nuts, buddy.

1874
01:24:08,776 --> 01:24:11,745
Come on!
Somebody fuckin' hit me!

1875
01:24:11,745 --> 01:24:13,614
Fuckin' hit me, huh?

1876
01:24:13,614 --> 01:24:15,483
Fuckin' hit me!

1877
01:24:16,650 --> 01:24:18,486
Fuckin' hit me!

1878
01:24:18,486 --> 01:24:19,789
Hey, stop, stop.

1879
01:24:21,789 --> 01:24:23,724
I got
your messages after,

1880
01:24:23,724 --> 01:24:25,392
when I was
tryin' to call you.

1881
01:24:25,392 --> 01:24:27,348
That's...
That's such bullshit, Jeff.

1882
01:24:48,716 --> 01:24:50,387
You drunk?

1883
01:24:53,387 --> 01:24:54,889
Not anymore.

1884
01:24:54,889 --> 01:24:56,924
Were you ever gonna
show up tonight?

1885
01:24:56,924 --> 01:24:59,398
Or were you just gonna
leave me sitting there?

1886
01:25:04,398 --> 01:25:05,800
What is this?

1887
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,800
Open it.

1888
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,235
What is it?

1889
01:25:08,235 --> 01:25:09,235
Open it.

1890
01:25:08,235 --> 01:25:09,403
Why?

1891
01:25:09,403 --> 01:25:10,511
Open the letter.

1892
01:25:17,511 --> 01:25:19,246
"Someone small
and wonderful

1893
01:25:19,246 --> 01:25:20,682
"is about to happen to you."

1894
01:25:21,682 --> 01:25:23,855
"Someone small and..."

1895
01:25:27,855 --> 01:25:29,523
Is this a fuckin' joke?

1896
01:25:29,523 --> 01:25:32,200
No, it's not a joke.
Why would I joke about this?

1897
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,434
Is this like a...

1898
01:25:40,434 --> 01:25:41,470
Yeah.

1899
01:25:43,470 --> 01:25:44,844
Like what...

1900
01:25:50,844 --> 01:25:52,846
I can't do this.

1901
01:25:52,846 --> 01:25:54,586
Someone else
you don't show up for.

1902
01:25:58,586 --> 01:25:59,820
Erin, you... You...

1903
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:02,690
Jeff, I gave up
my family for you.

1904
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:05,292
And my job.
I'm not giving this up, too.

1905
01:26:05,292 --> 01:26:06,694
This is bigger than you.

1906
01:26:06,694 --> 01:26:08,295
I thought you were careful.

1907
01:26:08,295 --> 01:26:10,297
Careful?

1908
01:26:10,297 --> 01:26:12,700
- I can't do this.
- I can't do it.

1909
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:14,335
I can't raise a kid.
I can't look after him.

1910
01:26:14,335 --> 01:26:15,335
I can't... I can't look...

1911
01:26:15,736 --> 01:26:16,837
What am I supposed to do?

1912
01:26:16,837 --> 01:26:18,505
I'm supposed
to chase after him?

1913
01:26:18,505 --> 01:26:19,974
Like, I'm supposed
to chase after him?

1914
01:26:19,974 --> 01:26:21,642
How am I gonna
take care of him?

1915
01:26:21,642 --> 01:26:23,244
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna mess him up.

1916
01:26:23,244 --> 01:26:24,578
Yes, you are gonna
mess him up.

1917
01:26:24,578 --> 01:26:25,813
But not because
you don't have legs.

1918
01:26:25,813 --> 01:26:28,482
Because you're
a fucking kid still.

1919
01:26:28,482 --> 01:26:29,883
You let your mom
push you around

1920
01:26:29,883 --> 01:26:31,852
like a baby in a stroller.

1921
01:26:31,852 --> 01:26:33,387
Oh, fuck you, Erin.

1922
01:26:33,387 --> 01:26:34,488
You do!

1923
01:26:34,488 --> 01:26:35,023
Fuck you, Erin!

1924
01:26:36,023 --> 01:26:37,491
You just have to show up
for once.

1925
01:26:37,491 --> 01:26:38,491
Show up?

1926
01:26:37,491 --> 01:26:38,792
Yes.

1927
01:26:38,792 --> 01:26:40,792
Show up?

1928
01:26:38,792 --> 01:26:40,327
Yes!

1929
01:26:40,327 --> 01:26:43,631
I fucking showed up for you!
I showed up!

1930
01:26:43,631 --> 01:26:45,599
I was standing there for you!

1931
01:26:45,599 --> 01:26:47,599
Oh, fuckin' what...

1932
01:26:45,599 --> 01:26:47,268
And look what it got me!

1933
01:26:47,268 --> 01:26:48,736
So this is my fault, then?

1934
01:26:48,736 --> 01:26:50,371
I showed up for you!

1935
01:26:50,371 --> 01:26:51,605
All of this
is my fault, right?

1936
01:26:51,605 --> 01:26:52,006
I showed up for you!

1937
01:26:53,006 --> 01:26:54,875
It doesn't scare me!
Just show up, that's it!

1938
01:26:54,875 --> 01:26:58,679
I can't! I can't! I can't!
I can't do it!

1939
01:26:58,679 --> 01:27:00,781
Why do you even want me?

1940
01:27:00,781 --> 01:27:03,657
Why? I'm such a fuckup!

1941
01:27:09,657 --> 01:27:12,059
Can't do it. I'm not...
I can't do it. I can't.

1942
01:27:23,404 --> 01:27:25,510
Don't walk away from me. Erin!

1943
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:30,046
Erin!

1944
01:27:33,046 --> 01:27:34,549
Erin!

1945
01:27:35,549 --> 01:27:37,851
Don't walk away from me.

1946
01:27:37,851 --> 01:27:40,554
Erin! Erin!

1947
01:27:40,554 --> 01:27:42,423
Erin!

1948
01:27:42,423 --> 01:27:45,726
Erin, don't walk away from...
Erin!

1949
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:48,337
Hey!

1950
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:02,852
Mind your own
fuckin' business!

1951
01:28:16,557 --> 01:28:18,426
Hey!

1952
01:28:21,562 --> 01:28:23,706
Erin!

1953
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:37,745
Hey!

1954
01:28:37,745 --> 01:28:39,514
Open the door!

1955
01:28:40,514 --> 01:28:42,516
Erin!

1956
01:28:42,516 --> 01:28:44,753
Erin. Erin.

1957
01:28:45,753 --> 01:28:47,492
Erin. Erin!

1958
01:28:51,492 --> 01:28:55,499
Please!
Please! Please!

1959
01:29:49,783 --> 01:29:51,785
Go help somebody else.

1960
01:29:51,785 --> 01:29:53,221
Lay back, I got you.
I got you.

1961
01:29:54,221 --> 01:29:55,958
Help somebody else!

1962
01:29:57,958 --> 01:29:59,460
Stay calm.

1963
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:01,829
Go help somebody else.
I'm good.

1964
01:30:13,841 --> 01:30:15,142
This one's critical.

1965
01:30:41,235 --> 01:30:42,878
We need help.

1966
01:30:50,878 --> 01:30:52,015
Hold on. Just relax.

1967
01:30:55,015 --> 01:30:58,519
You're going to be okay.
Help is coming.

1968
01:30:58,519 --> 01:31:00,270
Over here!
We need a chair over here.

1969
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:17,074
Erin...

1970
01:31:22,074 --> 01:31:24,281
Please, open the door.

1971
01:31:41,261 --> 01:31:42,064
Carlos.

1972
01:31:44,064 --> 01:31:45,908
Jeff.

1973
01:31:54,908 --> 01:31:56,276
Oh, you want one of these?

1974
01:31:56,276 --> 01:31:57,945
Uh... Coffee, please.

1975
01:31:57,945 --> 01:31:59,212
Want to have a beer,
anything like that?

1976
01:31:59,212 --> 01:32:00,316
No. Thank you.

1977
01:32:02,316 --> 01:32:03,684
It's too early for me.

1978
01:32:05,218 --> 01:32:07,756
Not for me.

1979
01:32:09,756 --> 01:32:11,660
Well, thanks for showing up.

1980
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:15,239
It's the least I could do.

1981
01:32:26,239 --> 01:32:27,608
So...

1982
01:32:27,608 --> 01:32:28,914
Yeah.

1983
01:32:33,914 --> 01:32:35,849
Why were you there?

1984
01:32:35,849 --> 01:32:37,284
At the finish line?

1985
01:32:37,284 --> 01:32:40,721
Yeah, I mean, y'know, like,
based on that hat

1986
01:32:40,721 --> 01:32:43,657
and my limited knowledge
of aerodynamics,

1987
01:32:43,657 --> 01:32:45,657
I assume it wasn't to run.

1988
01:32:45,125 --> 01:32:48,962
No, no, I...
I wasn't there
to run, I...

1989
01:32:48,962 --> 01:32:51,064
I was there for my boys.

1990
01:32:51,064 --> 01:32:52,265
They were running in the...

1991
01:32:52,265 --> 01:32:54,735
No, no, my...

1992
01:32:54,735 --> 01:32:56,973
My boys are dead.

1993
01:32:59,973 --> 01:33:01,341
Shit.

1994
01:33:01,341 --> 01:33:03,977
They died years ago.

1995
01:33:03,977 --> 01:33:05,879
Uh...

1996
01:33:05,879 --> 01:33:08,092
Oh. Thank you.

1997
01:33:20,092 --> 01:33:22,162
Do you have kids?

1998
01:33:22,162 --> 01:33:23,366
Mmm. Uh...

1999
01:33:26,366 --> 01:33:27,970
Mmm.

2000
01:33:29,970 --> 01:33:32,706
Alex, uh, was my oldest.

2001
01:33:32,706 --> 01:33:34,708
Uh, he was a Marine,

2002
01:33:34,708 --> 01:33:37,879
but he got killed
by a sniper in Najaf.

2003
01:33:38,879 --> 01:33:40,881
You know,
the way I find out is,

2004
01:33:40,881 --> 01:33:43,116
a van pulls up in front
of my house and...

2005
01:33:43,116 --> 01:33:46,422
And three Marines,
they get out.

2006
01:33:48,422 --> 01:33:50,323
But I knew.

2007
01:33:50,323 --> 01:33:53,128
I knew before they rang
the doorbell, I knew.

2008
01:33:55,128 --> 01:33:57,332
And then I did something
very stupid, right?

2009
01:33:59,332 --> 01:34:01,868
I grabbed a can
of gasoline
and a blowtorch

2010
01:34:01,868 --> 01:34:04,173
and I ran past them and...

2011
01:34:06,173 --> 01:34:09,076
And I locked myself
in their van.

2012
01:34:09,076 --> 01:34:11,344
They tried to
pull me out. The...

2013
01:34:11,344 --> 01:34:14,081
The blowtorch sparked
and I, um...

2014
01:34:18,085 --> 01:34:20,052
Those Marines,

2015
01:34:20,052 --> 01:34:22,426
they could have died,
and they saved me.

2016
01:34:26,426 --> 01:34:28,495
The worst part is, I...

2017
01:34:28,495 --> 01:34:31,366
I had to go to my son's
funeral on a stretcher.

2018
01:34:33,366 --> 01:34:35,973
I'm not proud of that,
you know.

2019
01:34:39,973 --> 01:34:41,375
What about
your other son?

2020
01:34:42,375 --> 01:34:43,946
Brian.

2021
01:34:45,946 --> 01:34:47,050
You remind me of Brian.

2022
01:34:50,050 --> 01:34:51,953
He took his own life.

2023
01:34:52,953 --> 01:34:54,521
It was too much for him.

2024
01:34:54,521 --> 01:34:57,091
You know, losing his brother,
and seeing me like that.

2025
01:35:00,994 --> 01:35:02,497
Shit, Carlos.

2026
01:35:03,497 --> 01:35:06,867
I can't tell you how much

2027
01:35:06,867 --> 01:35:09,873
I wish I had been there
for them when they needed me.

2028
01:35:12,873 --> 01:35:15,408
Hmm. But now I...

2029
01:35:15,408 --> 01:35:18,411
I travel the country,
talking to soldiers.

2030
01:35:18,411 --> 01:35:21,384
Mostly about PTSD
and depression.

2031
01:35:24,384 --> 01:35:26,153
I help a little.

2032
01:35:26,153 --> 01:35:28,524
And it keeps me going.

2033
01:35:30,524 --> 01:35:32,028
But the truth is...

2034
01:35:35,028 --> 01:35:36,297
I don't understand.

2035
01:35:37,297 --> 01:35:38,034
Mmm.

2036
01:35:49,843 --> 01:35:52,312
I was there that day
at the finish line

2037
01:35:52,312 --> 01:35:55,125
handing out American flags
for my boys.

2038
01:36:05,125 --> 01:36:07,294
When the first bomb
went off,

2039
01:36:07,294 --> 01:36:10,064
I looked up and I saw
a big ball of fire

2040
01:36:12,064 --> 01:36:15,402
and my body wanted to run.

2041
01:36:15,402 --> 01:36:19,140
But I thought,
this is a moment, huh?

2042
01:36:20,140 --> 01:36:22,475
Make a better choice.

2043
01:36:22,475 --> 01:36:24,346
So I ran to the fire
and there you were.

2044
01:36:26,346 --> 01:36:28,415
Helping you

2045
01:36:28,415 --> 01:36:29,083
made me feel

2046
01:36:31,083 --> 01:36:33,354
like I had helped my son.

2047
01:36:34,354 --> 01:36:36,492
And for that,
I am grateful.

2048
01:36:39,492 --> 01:36:41,963
You're grateful?

2049
01:36:42,963 --> 01:36:44,466
Yeah.

2050
01:36:46,466 --> 01:36:49,238
You help me
as much as I help you.

2051
01:36:51,238 --> 01:36:53,179
And I came here to say,
"Thank you."

2052
01:36:59,179 --> 01:37:00,335
Hmm.

2053
01:38:02,175 --> 01:38:04,145
Straight to voicemail, huh?

2054
01:38:05,145 --> 01:38:07,647
I don't blame ya.

2055
01:38:07,647 --> 01:38:10,517
<i> Listen,
I've been thinking, um...</i>

2056
01:38:10,517 --> 01:38:14,554
<i> You know, our...
Our kid, he or she</i>

2057
01:38:14,554 --> 01:38:18,294
is, uh... Gonna have legs.

2058
01:38:21,294 --> 01:38:24,331
<i> You're gonna be, like,
a really good mom.</i>

2059
01:38:24,331 --> 01:38:28,435
<i> 'Cause you been dealin' with
a big, dumb kid already.</i>

2060
01:38:28,435 --> 01:38:30,236
<i> Sittin' here, uh,</i>

2061
01:38:30,236 --> 01:38:32,205
<i> bein' without you, it's like
the worst fuckin' thing</i>

2062
01:38:32,205 --> 01:38:33,743
<i> that's ever happened to me.</i>

2063
01:38:36,743 --> 01:38:38,481
By a long shot.

2064
01:38:41,481 --> 01:38:43,350
<i> There was this, like,
there was this time</i>

2065
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:45,753
<i> in the hospital when,
like, I...</i>

2066
01:38:46,753 --> 01:38:49,088
<i> I just wanna give up.</i>

2067
01:38:49,088 --> 01:38:50,757
<i> Y'know, like, where I...</i>

2068
01:38:50,757 --> 01:38:53,293
<i> Just, like,
didn't care if I...</i>

2069
01:38:53,293 --> 01:38:56,293
Come on. Come on.

2070
01:38:53,293 --> 01:38:56,597
<i>...died or not. And...</i>

2071
01:38:57,597 --> 01:39:00,233
<i> Now I just wanna...</i>

2072
01:39:00,233 --> 01:39:01,768
Come on, man.
Come on, man.

2073
01:39:01,768 --> 01:39:03,403
Come on, man.

2074
01:39:03,403 --> 01:39:05,037
<i>I just wanna walk.</i>

2075
01:39:05,037 --> 01:39:06,473
<i> Y'know, I just wanna stand up.</i>

2076
01:39:06,473 --> 01:39:10,243
I wanna see the world
from higher up, y'know?

2077
01:39:10,243 --> 01:39:12,245
I just...
I just wanna be normal.

2078
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:14,015
Conference
on the mound.

2079
01:39:15,015 --> 01:39:16,416
You wanna just go
out there and just make

2080
01:39:16,416 --> 01:39:17,684
a fool outta yourself
in front of everybody?

2081
01:39:17,684 --> 01:39:19,185
You can't do it like this.

2082
01:39:19,185 --> 01:39:20,220
What, I got the catcher
walkin' out to the...

2083
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:21,220
Let's go, Coach.

2084
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:21,488
What?

2085
01:39:21,488 --> 01:39:23,123
I'm gonna put him in.

2086
01:39:23,123 --> 01:39:25,392
What are you talkin' about?
I threw one ball, guys.

2087
01:39:25,392 --> 01:39:27,193
It's your whole
shoulder, your whole body...

2088
01:39:27,193 --> 01:39:28,395
Aim for his balls,
he's wearin' a cup.

2089
01:39:28,395 --> 01:39:29,729
See, that's a little better.

2090
01:39:29,729 --> 01:39:30,764
How 'bout you throw
that over the plate?

2091
01:39:30,764 --> 01:39:32,365
Here we go.

2092
01:39:32,365 --> 01:39:35,101
Oh, Jesus Christ!
That's terrible.

2093
01:39:35,101 --> 01:39:37,337
Thirty-seven thousand fans
are gonna be booin' your ass.

2094
01:39:37,337 --> 01:39:39,139
You're all messed up,
all right?

2095
01:39:39,139 --> 01:39:40,540
So listen to me.

2096
01:39:40,540 --> 01:39:42,509
Just listen. All right?

2097
01:39:42,509 --> 01:39:44,611
You're a bunch
of fuckin' disasters.

2098
01:39:44,611 --> 01:39:46,078
Jesus.

2099
01:39:46,078 --> 01:39:47,414
You got that right.

2100
01:39:47,414 --> 01:39:49,249
But I wouldn't trade ya in
for anything.

2101
01:39:49,249 --> 01:39:51,218
So just do me a favor,
all right?

2102
01:39:52,218 --> 01:39:53,521
Help me out?

2103
01:39:54,521 --> 01:39:55,521
All right?

2104
01:39:54,521 --> 01:39:55,655
Let's go. Okay.

2105
01:39:57,190 --> 01:39:58,291
Come on, buddy,
muscle memory.

2106
01:39:58,291 --> 01:40:00,060
You know how to do this.

2107
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:01,694
<i>And now it's just about
healing, getting better</i>

2108
01:40:01,694 --> 01:40:04,631
<i> and showin' the world
I'm fine and that, y'know,</i>

2109
01:40:04,631 --> 01:40:06,299
<i> I'm not gonna let this
hold me down, y'know,</i>

2110
01:40:06,299 --> 01:40:08,301
<i> 'cause then
maybe if they see that,</i>

2111
01:40:08,301 --> 01:40:11,538
<i> then maybe they won't let
stuff hold them down, either.</i>

2112
01:40:11,538 --> 01:40:15,308
<i> And y'know there's always
gonna be pain, I think,</i>

2113
01:40:15,308 --> 01:40:18,511
<i> y'know, but, I dunno, I just</i>

2114
01:40:18,511 --> 01:40:20,247
<i> wanna, like...</i>

2115
01:40:23,450 --> 01:40:25,190
<i>...live.</i>

2116
01:40:38,565 --> 01:40:40,600
<i>...the Marathon tragedy,</i>

2117
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:42,602
<i> was a man in a cowboy hat,</i>

2118
01:40:42,602 --> 01:40:45,538
<i> rescuing a severely
injured man.</i>

2119
01:40:45,538 --> 01:40:48,842
<i> The man in the cowboy hat
had lost one son...</i>

2120
01:40:54,848 --> 01:40:57,383
How you feelin', Carlos?

2121
01:40:57,383 --> 01:40:59,419
A little nervous.

2122
01:40:59,419 --> 01:41:00,653
Yeah.

2123
01:41:00,653 --> 01:41:02,823
My hands are shakin'.

2124
01:41:03,823 --> 01:41:05,758
My boys would have loved this.

2125
01:41:21,608 --> 01:41:23,608
Hey, Carlos.

2126
01:41:21,608 --> 01:41:23,379
Yeah?

2127
01:41:26,379 --> 01:41:28,381
I'm gonna be a father.

2128
01:41:30,550 --> 01:41:32,724
That's wonderful.

2129
01:41:37,724 --> 01:41:39,425
It's time, Jeff.

2130
01:41:39,425 --> 01:41:40,425
Ready?

2131
01:41:39,425 --> 01:41:40,338
Yeah.

2132
01:41:52,338 --> 01:41:54,407
A hero and his hero,
right?

2133
01:42:32,745 --> 01:42:33,745
Hi. How are you?

2134
01:42:32,745 --> 01:42:33,913
Hello.

2135
01:42:33,913 --> 01:42:35,913
Good.

2136
01:42:33,913 --> 01:42:35,215
I'm Jackie.

2137
01:42:35,215 --> 01:42:36,349
How are you, Jackie? Jeff.

2138
01:42:36,349 --> 01:42:37,349
How are you?

2139
01:42:36,349 --> 01:42:37,650
Jeff, nice to meet you.

2140
01:42:37,650 --> 01:42:39,650
So nice to have you here.

2141
01:42:37,650 --> 01:42:39,285
Hi.

2142
01:42:39,285 --> 01:42:40,285
Hi, there, how are you?

2143
01:42:39,285 --> 01:42:40,720
Nice to meet you, Carlos.

2144
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:41,955
All right,
so we're gonna walk you out

2145
01:42:41,955 --> 01:42:43,223
right in front
of the mound and...

2146
01:42:43,223 --> 01:42:43,223
...sound good?

2147
01:42:43,223 --> 01:42:43,223
All right.

2148
01:42:43,890 --> 01:42:45,225
All right, let's go.

2149
01:42:45,225 --> 01:42:46,292
Been practicing?

2150
01:42:46,292 --> 01:42:47,529
Yeah.

2151
01:42:49,529 --> 01:42:51,397
Go Bauman!

2152
01:43:09,582 --> 01:43:10,750
Your boy's on the TV.

2153
01:43:10,750 --> 01:43:12,285
There he is,
there he is.

2154
01:43:22,829 --> 01:43:24,800
Oh, wow.

2155
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:29,402
Here comes the ball now.

2156
01:43:29,402 --> 01:43:31,437
That's a special ball.

2157
01:43:31,437 --> 01:43:32,844
Yes, it is.

2158
01:43:37,844 --> 01:43:39,312
Hi, I'm Pedro Martinez.

2159
01:43:39,312 --> 01:43:40,480
I think I know
who you are.

2160
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:41,814
Oh, great.

2161
01:43:41,814 --> 01:43:43,814
How you doing?

2162
01:43:41,814 --> 01:43:43,516
I'm good.

2163
01:43:43,516 --> 01:43:44,884
You're very brave,
you know?

2164
01:43:44,884 --> 01:43:45,019
We're all proud of you.

2165
01:43:46,019 --> 01:43:47,320
Thank you.

2166
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:48,755
Here.

2167
01:43:48,755 --> 01:43:51,724
You gotta show me
how to do a circle changeup.

2168
01:43:51,724 --> 01:43:53,724
Well...

2169
01:43:53,826 --> 01:43:55,762
Go Bauman!

2170
01:43:55,762 --> 01:43:57,001
Yeah! Whoo!

2171
01:44:02,001 --> 01:44:03,870
All right, you got any tips?

2172
01:44:03,870 --> 01:44:05,638
Well, aim high.

2173
01:44:05,638 --> 01:44:06,773
You're gonna be
all right, kid.

2174
01:44:06,773 --> 01:44:07,501
All right.

2175
01:44:48,014 --> 01:44:49,351
How did you get so good?

2176
01:44:51,351 --> 01:44:53,386
Let's go!

2177
01:44:58,925 --> 01:45:00,360
He was good
under pressure.

2178
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:01,661
You've gotta
give it to him.

2179
01:45:01,661 --> 01:45:03,496
All right?
You've gotta give it to him.

2180
01:45:03,496 --> 01:45:04,496
He is under pressure.

2181
01:45:03,496 --> 01:45:04,864
There's a lot...

2182
01:45:04,864 --> 01:45:06,905
A lot of people watching that.

2183
01:45:12,905 --> 01:45:15,641
<i>Carlos and Jeff
have gigantic smiles</i>

2184
01:45:15,641 --> 01:45:17,477
<i> from ear to ear
on their faces.</i>

2185
01:45:17,477 --> 01:45:20,046
<i> What a... What a great moment.</i>

2186
01:45:20,046 --> 01:45:21,948
<i>See those guys coming out,</i>

2187
01:45:21,948 --> 01:45:24,117
<i> you know, everybody
cheering and clapping.</i>

2188
01:45:24,117 --> 01:45:26,853
<i> Actually, you know,
I got goose bumps.</i>

2189
01:45:26,853 --> 01:45:28,621
<i> I got chills. So emotional.</i>

2190
01:45:28,621 --> 01:45:30,390
<i> The fans were on their feet.</i>

2191
01:45:30,390 --> 01:45:32,658
<i> Wonderful tribute
by the Red Sox.</i>

2192
01:45:32,658 --> 01:45:34,658
It was a nice pitch.

2193
01:45:32,658 --> 01:45:34,092
It was not on the corner.

2194
01:45:34,092 --> 01:45:35,092
Thanks...

2195
01:45:34,092 --> 01:45:35,862
Either way,

2196
01:45:35,862 --> 01:45:37,862
I'll still buy you a beer.

2197
01:45:35,862 --> 01:45:37,163
No, it wasn't. It was on...

2198
01:45:37,163 --> 01:45:38,163
I'll still get you a beer.

2199
01:45:37,163 --> 01:45:38,598
Hey.

2200
01:45:38,598 --> 01:45:40,500
So I try and do
a circle changeup.

2201
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:41,868
How you doin', man?

2202
01:45:41,868 --> 01:45:43,868
Did Pedro show it to you?

2203
01:45:41,868 --> 01:45:43,503
Good job, Jeff.

2204
01:45:43,503 --> 01:45:44,804
Hey, maybe
we should turn around.

2205
01:45:44,804 --> 01:45:46,804
You're Boston Strong.

2206
01:45:44,804 --> 01:45:46,839
Thank you.

2207
01:45:46,839 --> 01:45:47,907
All right,
watch the shoulder,
that's his throwin' arm.

2208
01:45:47,907 --> 01:45:49,907
Careful.

2209
01:45:47,907 --> 01:45:49,542
I know. Careful, I gotta

2210
01:45:49,542 --> 01:45:50,542
protect my throwin' arm.

2211
01:45:49,542 --> 01:45:50,810
Got a career ahead.

2212
01:45:50,810 --> 01:45:51,911
Hey, don't pat
the throwin' arm, man.

2213
01:45:53,078 --> 01:45:54,414
Hey! Hey!

2214
01:45:54,414 --> 01:45:55,414
Jeff!

2215
01:45:54,414 --> 01:45:55,982
Sounds like you, Sull.

2216
01:45:55,982 --> 01:45:58,451
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

2217
01:45:58,451 --> 01:45:59,719
Whoa, stop.

2218
01:45:59,719 --> 01:46:01,487
Can I talk to you
for a second, man?

2219
01:46:01,487 --> 01:46:02,487
What's goin' on here?

2220
01:46:01,487 --> 01:46:02,989
Kind of in a rush.

2221
01:46:02,989 --> 01:46:04,524
Just gimme a second here.
I just wanna talk to him

2222
01:46:04,524 --> 01:46:05,524
for a second.

2223
01:46:04,524 --> 01:46:05,992
What can I help you with?

2224
01:46:05,992 --> 01:46:06,628
Uh...

2225
01:46:08,628 --> 01:46:09,897
My, um...

2226
01:46:10,897 --> 01:46:12,698
My kid brother, he, uh,

2227
01:46:12,698 --> 01:46:14,667
was in the Marines, uh...

2228
01:46:14,667 --> 01:46:16,736
You know, over in the war.

2229
01:46:16,736 --> 01:46:19,639
And 'bout five years ago,
he got hit with an IED.

2230
01:46:19,639 --> 01:46:21,607
He's gone, man.

2231
01:46:21,607 --> 01:46:22,909
But, uh...

2232
01:46:22,909 --> 01:46:24,177
Sorry about that, man.

2233
01:46:24,177 --> 01:46:25,912
Yeah.

2234
01:46:25,912 --> 01:46:28,147
You know what, I saw
your picture that morning.

2235
01:46:28,147 --> 01:46:30,516
You know, after the bomb?

2236
01:46:30,516 --> 01:46:33,553
All I could think about
was Thomas.

2237
01:46:33,553 --> 01:46:35,121
Just lyin' there in the dirt.

2238
01:46:35,121 --> 01:46:37,723
I... I get so fuckin' angry,
y'know?

2239
01:46:37,723 --> 01:46:39,792
Y'know, but seein' you
out there today,

2240
01:46:39,792 --> 01:46:41,561
throwin' that fuckin' pitch,

2241
01:46:41,561 --> 01:46:43,796
you showed the world that
they can't fuckin' break us

2242
01:46:43,796 --> 01:46:46,132
no matter what
the hell they do.

2243
01:46:46,132 --> 01:46:47,834
Y'know, it...
It gave me a little hope,

2244
01:46:47,834 --> 01:46:49,569
made me feel a little better,
and I just wanna say

2245
01:46:49,569 --> 01:46:50,773
fuckin' thank you for that,
man, that's all.

2246
01:46:53,773 --> 01:46:55,041
What's your name?

2247
01:46:55,041 --> 01:46:56,010
Uh, my name's Larry, uh...

2248
01:46:58,010 --> 01:47:00,913
Can I shake your hand, Larry?

2249
01:47:00,913 --> 01:47:02,913
You wanna shake my hand?

2250
01:47:00,913 --> 01:47:02,191
Yeah.

2251
01:47:12,191 --> 01:47:13,559
It's gonna be all right.

2252
01:47:13,559 --> 01:47:14,727
Yeah?

2253
01:47:14,727 --> 01:47:15,028
I'm gonna be okay, right?

2254
01:47:16,028 --> 01:47:17,997
So you're gonna be okay.

2255
01:47:17,997 --> 01:47:19,997
Yeah.

2256
01:47:17,997 --> 01:47:19,732
Yeah.

2257
01:47:19,732 --> 01:47:20,732
Yeah.

2258
01:47:19,732 --> 01:47:20,867
All right.

2259
01:47:20,867 --> 01:47:22,134
Hey, go Sox.

2260
01:47:22,134 --> 01:47:23,603
Thank you. Go Sox.

2261
01:47:23,603 --> 01:47:25,603
Go Sox.

2262
01:47:23,603 --> 01:47:25,671
Go Sox.

2263
01:47:25,671 --> 01:47:26,806
Let's go, Sox!

2264
01:47:37,817 --> 01:47:39,817
Let's go get that beer.

2265
01:47:37,817 --> 01:47:39,285
Mr. Bauman?

2266
01:47:39,285 --> 01:47:40,953
Hi. Um...

2267
01:47:40,953 --> 01:47:42,688
My daughter here actually
wrote a report on you

2268
01:47:42,688 --> 01:47:44,688
for her third grade class.

2269
01:47:42,688 --> 01:47:44,957
Oh, yeah?

2270
01:47:44,957 --> 01:47:46,058
What's your name?

2271
01:47:46,058 --> 01:47:48,828
Sophie. Do your legs hurt?

2272
01:47:48,828 --> 01:47:51,063
Uh, sometimes. Yeah.

2273
01:47:51,063 --> 01:47:52,532
What'd you get on your report?

2274
01:47:52,532 --> 01:47:53,000
I got an A-minus.

2275
01:47:57,136 --> 01:47:58,738
<i>Just wanna
share this with you...</i>

2276
01:47:58,738 --> 01:48:02,108
<i>2009,
I ran the Boston Marathon...</i>

2277
01:48:02,108 --> 01:48:04,610
<i>The 89th floor
of the South Tower, but...</i>

2278
01:48:04,610 --> 01:48:06,312
<i>...and I remember
going through that...</i>

2279
01:48:06,312 --> 01:48:08,981
<i>...confirmed there were
77 people on that floor,</i>

2280
01:48:08,981 --> 01:48:10,283
<i> 67 died.</i>

2281
01:48:14,020 --> 01:48:16,657
<i>The only reason
they got out was because...</i>

2282
01:48:35,274 --> 01:48:36,199
All right.

2283
01:49:00,199 --> 01:49:02,969
Y'know,
I did the best I could

2284
01:49:02,969 --> 01:49:04,637
with what I had.

2285
01:49:04,637 --> 01:49:06,037
You did all right, Ma.

2286
01:49:06,037 --> 01:49:08,941
And I... I just wish
I'd done better for ya.

2287
01:49:08,941 --> 01:49:10,680
You did all right, Ma.

2288
01:49:14,680 --> 01:49:16,751
You're gonna be
a wonderful father.

2289
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:22,777
All right.

2290
01:49:44,777 --> 01:49:46,383
You're all right there,
Jeffie.

2291
01:49:50,383 --> 01:49:51,051
We're good.

2292
01:49:53,051 --> 01:49:54,823
I'm good.

2293
01:51:37,256 --> 01:51:38,325
I love you.

2294
01:51:43,028 --> 01:51:44,533
Good.
