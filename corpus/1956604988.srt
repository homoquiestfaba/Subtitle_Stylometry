Ladies and gentlemen.

21
00:04:37,618 --> 00:04:41,566
Ladies and gentlemen, thank
you all for coming to this

22
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:43,567
momentous gallery event.

23
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:47,908
Everyone looks so dashing as ever.

24
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:55,038
A new film has opened to rave reviews,

25
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:58,229
and it is certainly destined to break

26
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,897
all previous box office notices.

27
00:05:02,045 --> 00:05:04,786
And as we are all aware

28
00:05:04,787 --> 00:05:07,487
this film which we celebrate tonight

29
00:05:07,488 --> 00:05:11,803
would be nothing if it
weren't for its star

30
00:05:11,804 --> 00:05:14,471
our lovely hostess this evening.

31
00:05:15,411 --> 00:05:18,661
(audience applauding)

32
00:05:22,126 --> 00:05:26,293
("Lover Come Back To
Me" by Annette Hanshaw)

33
00:05:34,426 --> 00:05:36,225
This may as well be a wake.

34
00:05:36,226 --> 00:05:38,031
That picture is practically belly up.

35
00:05:38,032 --> 00:05:39,682
What do you mean?

36
00:05:39,683 --> 00:05:42,231
The talk about the talkies, toots.

37
00:05:42,232 --> 00:05:45,350
There's a new game in
town and it ain't Rose.

38
00:05:45,351 --> 00:05:47,434
It's pictures with sound.

39
00:05:49,008 --> 00:05:51,541
Sure she's gorgeous and all,

40
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:54,933
but nobody wants to hear what's
coming out of her pie hole

41
00:05:54,934 --> 00:05:56,298
just like all dames.

42
00:05:56,299 --> 00:05:57,809
Hush up you.

43
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,372
And so without further ado

44
00:06:01,373 --> 00:06:05,040
it is my great pleasure
to introduce to you

45
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:09,246
our guest of honor and lovely hostess

46
00:06:09,247 --> 00:06:13,038
who has so graciously opened her home

47
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,651
to us this evening

48
00:06:14,652 --> 00:06:19,077
to hail this joyful occasion.

49
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:23,645
You know her as the brightest

50
00:06:23,646 --> 00:06:27,813
and most lovely and captivating
siren of the silver screen.

51
00:06:28,732 --> 00:06:30,928
Ladies and gentlemen,

52
00:06:30,929 --> 00:06:33,531
the eternally beautiful

53
00:06:33,532 --> 00:06:35,662
Ms. Rose Pettigrew.

54
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:38,002
(audience applause)

55
00:06:38,003 --> 00:06:41,586
(powerful dramatic music)

56
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,804
[Woman In Pearls] You look beautiful.

57
00:07:11,805 --> 00:07:13,902
Can I have an autograph?

58
00:07:13,903 --> 00:07:17,158
(slow melodramatic music)

59
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:18,659
Not now darling.

60
00:07:19,616 --> 00:07:23,580
[Woman In Pearls] Beautiful necklace.

61
00:07:23,581 --> 00:07:25,720
It's very expensive,

62
00:07:25,721 --> 00:07:28,721
and there isn't another one like it.

63
00:07:32,809 --> 00:07:34,383
Roses for Rose,

64
00:07:34,384 --> 00:07:36,885
the most beautiful of them all,

65
00:07:36,886 --> 00:07:40,386
but I wonder how this one smells up close.

66
00:07:41,286 --> 00:07:44,536
(soft poignant music)

67
00:07:47,124 --> 00:07:48,243
Lovely.

68
00:07:48,244 --> 00:07:50,236
Rose, Rose one moment.

69
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:53,064
That'll make a swell pic.

70
00:07:53,065 --> 00:07:54,065
There we go.

71
00:07:56,527 --> 00:07:59,212
Yes, we got it.

72
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:02,512
Gentlemen, I must
see to my other guests.

73
00:08:02,513 --> 00:08:04,430
Don't miss me too much.

74
00:08:11,222 --> 00:08:15,389
Looks like she's got some
bigger fish to fry, huh Bob?

75
00:08:17,417 --> 00:08:21,417
Boys, that's the thorniest
Rose I've ever met.

76
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,350
(soft dramatic music)

77
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:45,102
Hello, boys.

78
00:08:45,103 --> 00:08:46,175
Hi ya, Rosy.

79
00:08:46,176 --> 00:08:47,355
Howdy, ma'am.

80
00:08:47,356 --> 00:08:50,345
Rose (snarling).

81
00:08:50,346 --> 00:08:52,224
My, my, my you fellas sure do know

82
00:08:52,225 --> 00:08:54,900
how to make a girl feel welcomed.

83
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,594
Get rid of those awful
things will you darling?

84
00:08:57,595 --> 00:09:00,173
This is some hootenanny
you have here, Ms. Rose.

85
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:02,989
Yeah, this is some swinging to do.

86
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,186
Just a little soiree
to celebrate the film

87
00:09:06,187 --> 00:09:10,103
and my new pending
contract with the studio.

88
00:09:10,104 --> 00:09:13,003
Norman's taking care of all the details.

89
00:09:13,004 --> 00:09:16,087
When are we gonna really celebrate?

90
00:09:17,587 --> 00:09:19,432
Patience, boys,

91
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,266
all in good time.

92
00:09:22,383 --> 00:09:23,966
[Sonny] Hey, hey.

93
00:09:26,137 --> 00:09:28,137
Speaking of the devil.

94
00:09:31,761 --> 00:09:34,511
Here comes that pip squeak now.

95
00:09:35,406 --> 00:09:38,592
Rose, Rose, Rose we have to talk.

96
00:09:38,593 --> 00:09:39,932
Not now, Norman.

97
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:41,321
Don't be such a ninny.

98
00:09:41,322 --> 00:09:43,489
But, Rose, we must talk.

99
00:09:45,282 --> 00:09:47,532
I have very important news.

100
00:09:49,726 --> 00:09:50,993
I think you heard the lady

101
00:09:50,994 --> 00:09:53,342
she said run along little doggy.

102
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,899
(man barking)

103
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,625
With all respect, sirs

104
00:09:56,626 --> 00:10:00,543
this matter of business
doesn't pertain to you.

105
00:10:06,003 --> 00:10:09,931
Alright soldiers stand down.

106
00:10:09,932 --> 00:10:13,208
(tense dramatic music)

107
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:15,042
I can handle this.

108
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:19,195
Thank you, Rose,

109
00:10:19,196 --> 00:10:20,881
Ms. Pettigrew.

110
00:10:20,882 --> 00:10:24,132
(soft dramatic music)

111
00:10:39,146 --> 00:10:42,479
(squeaky door opening)

112
00:10:43,789 --> 00:10:46,217
Ms. Pettigrew, I apologize
for the intrusion,

113
00:10:46,218 --> 00:10:49,072
but this absolutely could not wait.

114
00:10:49,073 --> 00:10:50,966
I just talked with the lawyer.

115
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:53,702
Lawyers, phooey.

116
00:10:53,703 --> 00:10:57,237
I will have no speak of
lawyers on this night.

117
00:10:57,238 --> 00:10:59,251
It's a party, Norman,

118
00:10:59,252 --> 00:11:02,811
have a drink or how ever many
it takes to loosen you up.

119
00:11:02,812 --> 00:11:06,541
Whatever it is will wait until tomorrow.

120
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:07,542
But, Rose

121
00:11:10,593 --> 00:11:13,010
there is no tomorrow.

122
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:17,391
(soft dramatic music)

123
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:24,880

(eerie dramatic music)

127
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,003
Well,

00:14:13,847 --> 00:14:14,847
here we are.

129
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:24,176
You didn't start without me did you?

130
00:14:24,177 --> 00:14:26,019
We wouldn't think of
not waiting on such a

131
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,770
good looking woman like yourself.

132
00:14:30,223 --> 00:14:32,091
'Bout time ya made it.

133
00:14:32,092 --> 00:14:34,791
Yeah, 'cause now we can
really get this party started.

134
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:36,973
[Sonny] Here we go.

135
00:14:36,974 --> 00:14:40,990
And now your special
treat for your big day.

136
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:42,408
Get on the table.

137
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:50,860
[Rose] Boys, they're perfect.

138
00:14:50,861 --> 00:14:52,969
You always know what I like.

139
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,137

Excuse me have you seen Ms. Pettigrew?

170
00:18:50,016 --> 00:18:53,516
She must've bailed on this lousy spread.

00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:39,949
I ought a blow your ass...

190
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,464
Sonny, no.

191
00:20:42,465 --> 00:20:44,132
Stand down.

192
00:20:49,102 --> 00:20:51,435
What is the meaning of this?

193
00:20:53,725 --> 00:20:55,203
Norman.

194
00:20:55,204 --> 00:20:56,696
Ms. Pettigrew, I...

195
00:20:56,697 --> 00:20:59,605
Sorry I had no idea you
were in the middle of...

196
00:20:59,606 --> 00:21:01,866
Spit it out.

197
00:21:01,867 --> 00:21:05,149
Hey, you heard the lady spit it out.

198
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,483
This I...

199
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:12,992
Ms. Pettigrew, I must speak with you.

200
00:21:14,422 --> 00:21:16,755
Rose, it's extremely urgent.

201
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:23,137
I think this conversation
is best held in private.

202
00:21:25,582 --> 00:21:29,361
There's nothing you can't
say in front of my boys.

203
00:21:29,362 --> 00:21:32,749
Out with it or else.

204
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,583
I just got word from the studio.

205
00:21:36,751 --> 00:21:38,939
The film is a bomb.

206
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,773
(woman laughing)

207
00:21:42,931 --> 00:21:44,676
That's it.

208
00:21:44,677 --> 00:21:47,685
That's why you interrupted me.

209
00:21:47,686 --> 00:21:51,103
Not exactly there's more unfortunately.

210
00:21:54,672 --> 00:21:59,132
They tested the new talky
with audiences and...

211
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:01,010
No one cares about that the talkies.

212
00:22:01,011 --> 00:22:01,873
It's a fade.

213
00:22:01,874 --> 00:22:05,292
No, no, no the audience loved it.

214
00:22:05,293 --> 00:22:07,744
The talky is the future.

215
00:22:07,745 --> 00:22:09,403
The future is the talky.

216
00:22:09,404 --> 00:22:12,572
The studio wants nothing
but them from now on

217
00:22:12,573 --> 00:22:15,394
and no more silent pictures.

218
00:22:15,395 --> 00:22:17,592
That's why they told...

219
00:22:17,593 --> 00:22:21,037
(tense dramatic music)

220
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:22,955
That's why they what?

221
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:28,875
What's the matter,
Norman, cat got your tongue.

222
00:22:32,714 --> 00:22:35,214
That's why they, the studio

223
00:22:37,796 --> 00:22:40,287
cancelled your contract, Rose

224
00:22:40,288 --> 00:22:42,121
Ms. Pettigrew.

225
00:22:46,751 --> 00:22:48,168
Say that again.

226
00:22:49,311 --> 00:22:52,571
The studio cancelled your contract.

227
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:53,907
Fix it.

228
00:22:53,908 --> 00:22:56,597
There's nothing to fix.

229
00:22:56,598 --> 00:22:58,197
I tried.

230
00:22:58,198 --> 00:23:01,894
You know they've gone so far
as to ban you from the studio.

231
00:23:01,895 --> 00:23:02,728
It's over.

232
00:23:03,973 --> 00:23:06,698
It'll be aight just a misunderstanding.

233
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:09,150
Yeah, don't worry baby
everything's gonna be hunky-dory.

234
00:23:09,151 --> 00:23:11,228
Yeah, maybe for you.

235
00:23:11,229 --> 00:23:12,597
What about me?

236
00:23:12,598 --> 00:23:14,265
Come on baby cake.

237
00:23:15,536 --> 00:23:19,827
Come on remember what we
said together forever.

238
00:23:19,828 --> 00:23:21,166
Do you really mean it?

239
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:22,750
You bet I do.

240
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:28,690
It's aight, baby.

241
00:23:31,203 --> 00:23:34,534
Hey, baby cakes, put that
gun down nice and easy.

242
00:23:34,535 --> 00:23:36,506
[Erik] You don't wanna do this, Rose.

243
00:23:36,507 --> 00:23:38,257
I have to.

244
00:23:43,487 --> 00:23:47,320
Watch where you pointing
that thing, sister.

245
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:51,799
(soft dramatic music)

246
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:58,607
It's just like you said

247
00:23:58,608 --> 00:24:00,659
I'm holding you to it

248
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,618
Rose

249
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:03,560
Together

250
00:24:03,561 --> 00:24:04,894
forever.

251
00:24:08,623 --> 00:24:11,956
(tense dramatic music)

252
00:24:56,388 --> 00:25:00,555
(woman crying)

253
00:25:04,527 --> 00:25:08,110
(tense melodramatic music)

254
00:25:10,236 --> 00:25:12,040
(woman gasping)

255
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:15,624
They forced the brightest
star to burn out.

256
00:25:20,855 --> 00:25:24,355
(tense theatrical music)

257
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,514
[Danni] Well, here it is.

258
00:25:51,515 --> 00:25:54,031
[Reese] It's been so long I
almost forgot how big it is.

259
00:25:54,032 --> 00:25:56,213
[Danni] Yeah, and how much
work needs to be done to it.

260
00:25:56,214 --> 00:25:58,110
[Reese] We just have to
clean it up a little bit,

261
00:25:58,111 --> 00:25:59,356
make it presentable.

262
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:03,881
I mean the listing was as is
so the rest is up to the buyer.

263
00:26:03,882 --> 00:26:06,652
[Danni] Yeah, and
maybe a vampire killer.

264
00:26:06,653 --> 00:26:08,162
It's just so eerie.

265
00:26:08,163 --> 00:26:09,408
It's too quiet.

266
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:10,772
Well, no one's been here in forever

267
00:26:10,773 --> 00:26:12,698
since the last owner decades ago.

268
00:26:12,699 --> 00:26:15,437
I just don't understand
how this house hasn't sold.

269
00:26:15,438 --> 00:26:18,676
It's been sitting vacant
for what 80 years.

270
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,254
Something like that.

271
00:26:20,255 --> 00:26:22,561
It's been in escrow a dozen
times with different agencies

272
00:26:22,562 --> 00:26:25,175
and for some reason or another
they just all fell through.

273
00:26:25,176 --> 00:26:26,534
Weird.

274
00:26:26,535 --> 00:26:29,457
I mean the area's amazing,

275
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:31,950
price is reasonable enough

276
00:26:31,951 --> 00:26:34,527
must be some major problems
we don't know about.

277
00:26:34,528 --> 00:26:35,828
Or it's just destiny

278
00:26:35,829 --> 00:26:37,359
that we were the ones to sell the house.

279
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,188
I mean we sold it in couple
weeks within taking it on.

280
00:26:41,189 --> 00:26:43,740
Yeah, I think you might
be onto something there.

281
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:47,558
Just waiting for the two
hottest realtors in the world.

282
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:50,200
I mean think about what this
is gonna do for our business.

283
00:26:50,201 --> 00:26:52,294
Not only is it gonna cover the
overhead for an entire year,

284
00:26:52,295 --> 00:26:54,678
but people are gonna be talking about us.

285
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:57,622
We're gonna be the go-to
girls for the rich and famous.

286
00:26:57,623 --> 00:26:58,962
For selling houses that is.

287
00:26:58,963 --> 00:27:00,756
Yeah, or whatever (laughing).

288
00:27:00,757 --> 00:27:02,340
[Reese] Shut up.

289
00:27:20,655 --> 00:27:22,729
(gasping) Oh, my god.

290
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,386
I didn't mean to scare you that bad.

291
00:27:24,387 --> 00:27:26,470
Oh, my god, yeah right.

292
00:27:29,719 --> 00:27:30,829
What's wrong?

293
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,353
[Reese] Nothing.

294
00:27:32,354 --> 00:27:33,453
[Danni] Seriously.

295
00:27:33,454 --> 00:27:37,395
Okay. We did forget one
pretty important thing.

296
00:27:37,396 --> 00:27:39,617
I guess the only thing to do now is...

297
00:27:39,618 --> 00:27:40,701
Is what?

298
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:44,001
Make it official.

299
00:27:44,002 --> 00:27:45,401
Do you want do the honors?

300
00:27:45,402 --> 00:27:47,692
No, we do it together. We're a team.

301
00:27:47,693 --> 00:27:49,224
[Reese] Okay.

302
00:27:49,225 --> 00:27:50,058
Here.

303
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:55,851
There it's official.

304
00:27:55,852 --> 00:27:57,134
Alright we got a lot of work to do.

305
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:58,160
Come on.

306
00:27:58,161 --> 00:27:59,744
[Danni] Oh, god.

307
00:28:14,018 --> 00:28:18,345
[Reese] Whoa, would
you look at this place.

308
00:28:18,346 --> 00:28:22,513
[Danni] Would you look of
how much work we have to do.

309
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,698
(slow dramatic music)

310
00:28:26,699 --> 00:28:28,012
(woman coughing)

311
00:28:28,013 --> 00:28:31,065
Just remember to be careful
when you remove the sheets.

312
00:28:31,066 --> 00:28:32,566
[Reese] Got ya.

313
00:28:33,413 --> 00:28:36,915
[Danni] Next time we can
afford a cleaning crew.

314
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:38,666
[Reese] I hear ya.

315
00:28:40,831 --> 00:28:43,998
[Danni] Man it's like a fairy tale.

316
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,487
This is what I've been dying to see.

317
00:28:50,523 --> 00:28:51,856
It's beautiful.

318
00:28:55,811 --> 00:28:58,362
I assume it doesn't work.

319
00:28:58,363 --> 00:28:59,954
Doubt it but the
waters not turned on yet,

320
00:28:59,955 --> 00:29:02,205
so there's no way to tell.

321
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:08,619
Who could afford these places?

322
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,389
The buyer is who.

323
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,568
If we don't get this house cleaned up

324
00:29:11,569 --> 00:29:12,894
in the next couple
hours when he gets here,

325
00:29:12,895 --> 00:29:14,346
then we're screwed.

326
00:29:14,347 --> 00:29:15,304
He's gonna take one look at it,

327
00:29:15,305 --> 00:29:18,425
and decide to spend his money elsewhere.

328
00:29:18,426 --> 00:29:19,945
- But...
- No buts.

329
00:29:19,946 --> 00:29:23,113
We can talk and work at the same time.

330
00:29:29,874 --> 00:29:31,207
Come on, Danni.

331
00:29:32,076 --> 00:29:33,326
[Danni] Okay.

332
00:29:35,089 --> 00:29:38,672
(poignant dramatic music)

333
00:29:42,736 --> 00:29:45,903
(soft chiming bells)

334
00:30:47,052 --> 00:30:48,921
I think I'm gonna
check out that waterfall.

335
00:30:48,922 --> 00:30:50,916
See if I can clean up some of that debris.

336
00:30:50,917 --> 00:30:54,750
Okay, just leave the
dirty work for me then.

337
00:31:04,981 --> 00:31:07,168
(gentle dramatic music)

338
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:09,919
(ducks quacking)

339
00:31:13,082 --> 00:31:15,665
(door opening)

340
00:31:47,727 --> 00:31:50,560
(birds squawking)

341
00:32:26,076 --> 00:32:27,576
Earth to Reese.

342
00:32:29,302 --> 00:32:30,741
Sorry.

343
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:34,242
Think all this dust is getting to my head.

344
00:32:35,633 --> 00:32:36,856
What were you saying?

345
00:32:36,857 --> 00:32:39,212
I was asking you about the buyer.

346
00:32:39,213 --> 00:32:40,676
What's his deal?

347
00:32:40,677 --> 00:32:41,763
Other than the fact that he's late

348
00:32:41,764 --> 00:32:43,564
I don't really know anything about him.

349
00:32:43,565 --> 00:32:46,031
Why don't you just call
him and tell him we're here.

350
00:32:46,032 --> 00:32:47,789
I wish I could but

351
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:50,274
the only correspondence
he does is by letter.

352
00:32:50,275 --> 00:32:51,108
Letter.

353
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,593
Who writes anything anymore?

354
00:32:54,594 --> 00:32:56,574
Apparently he does.

355
00:32:56,575 --> 00:32:57,776
Nice penmanship.

356
00:32:57,777 --> 00:33:00,336
What's he do for a living?

357
00:33:00,337 --> 00:33:02,147
You just wanna know
whether he's hot or not.

358
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:03,857
And available.

359
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:06,209
Well, you'll see when he
shows up, if he shows up.

360
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,337
Don't say that.

361
00:33:07,338 --> 00:33:08,539
It's Hollywood.

362
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,778
He's just fashionably late.

363
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,934
Well, if he brings the cash
I'll forgive his tardiness.

364
00:33:11,935 --> 00:33:12,920
Cash.

365
00:33:12,921 --> 00:33:14,713
That's his payment of choice.

366
00:33:14,714 --> 00:33:16,635
If he has that much cash,

367
00:33:16,636 --> 00:33:18,571
I'll forgive him for anything

368
00:33:18,572 --> 00:33:20,059
including ugly.

369
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,162
You know it looks
like we've made a dent.

370
00:33:21,163 --> 00:33:22,281
Let's take a break.

371
00:33:22,282 --> 00:33:23,949
Yeah, about time.

372
00:33:24,931 --> 00:33:25,764
Careful.

373
00:33:34,021 --> 00:33:37,604
(eerie suspenseful music)

374
00:33:41,457 --> 00:33:44,374
Can you believe I got this going.

375
00:33:53,092 --> 00:33:54,842
Hey, check this out.

376
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:57,776
What is that?

377
00:33:57,777 --> 00:33:59,957
I found it by the waterfall.

378
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:02,129
It's beautiful.

379
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:04,149
Just costume jewelry you want it?

380
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,233
Let me see.

381
00:34:10,947 --> 00:34:13,547
This isn't costume jewelry.

382
00:34:13,548 --> 00:34:16,207
This could be worth a fortune.

383
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:18,619
It's fake why would someone
leave it here all these years.

384
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,628
Girl, bling is my thing,

385
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:22,979
and this is the real thing.

386
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,564
You should have this appraised.

387
00:34:24,565 --> 00:34:25,999
Take it. I don't believe it.

388
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
No, finders keepers and
this is a mega keeper.

389
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:34,579
Let's see what it looks like on you.

390
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,413
Fine.

391
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,883
(tense suspenseful music)

392
00:34:49,222 --> 00:34:50,722
How does it look?

393
00:34:51,745 --> 00:34:54,578
Looks like it was made for you.

394
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:56,957
Where you going?

395
00:34:56,958 --> 00:34:59,665
[Danni] I have a surprise.

396
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:03,498
No, I'm too tired I don't
think I can handle it.

397
00:35:03,499 --> 00:35:07,615
Then I guess I will have
to finish this all by myself.

398
00:35:07,616 --> 00:35:08,676
That's for the buyer.

399
00:35:08,677 --> 00:35:11,917
[Danni] Nope, secret stash.

400
00:35:11,918 --> 00:35:14,175
I wanted to celebrate
the most incredible sale

401
00:35:14,176 --> 00:35:16,046
with the most incredible partner.

402
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,214
[Reese] Awe

403
00:35:18,776 --> 00:35:19,609
thanks.

404
00:35:20,755 --> 00:35:22,674
[Danni] Of course.

405
00:35:22,675 --> 00:35:23,842
[Reese] Yum.

406
00:35:25,726 --> 00:35:29,088
To the other most amazing
partner in the entire world.

407
00:35:29,089 --> 00:35:30,506
Cheers.

408
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,512
This is house is amazing.

409
00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:40,044
This wine is amazing.

410
00:35:40,045 --> 00:35:42,454
Wonder why it never sold.

411
00:35:42,455 --> 00:35:45,185
Do you want the real story
or the Hollywood story?

412
00:35:45,186 --> 00:35:47,569
The real story I guess.

413
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,078
It's too damn expensive.

414
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:51,762
That sucks give me
the Hollywood version.

415
00:35:51,763 --> 00:35:55,520
Okay, legend has it that it
was owned by Rose Pettigrew.

416
00:35:55,521 --> 00:35:57,352
Rose Petti who?

417
00:35:57,353 --> 00:35:59,827
Only one of the most famous
actresses that ever lived,

418
00:35:59,828 --> 00:36:01,554
an icon of the silent era.

419
00:36:01,555 --> 00:36:03,497
I hate silent movies.

420
00:36:03,498 --> 00:36:05,418
Are you gonna let me finish.

421
00:36:05,419 --> 00:36:06,687
Proceed.

422
00:36:06,688 --> 00:36:08,818
An icon of silent movies,

423
00:36:08,819 --> 00:36:11,824
class, fashion, and sexual excess.

424
00:36:11,825 --> 00:36:13,775
Now I'm interested.

425
00:36:13,776 --> 00:36:15,307
I guess she threw
these really wild parties

426
00:36:15,308 --> 00:36:18,258
that were known for their
debauchery and perversions.

427
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,633
She was on top and nothing could stop her

428
00:36:20,634 --> 00:36:22,443
except for her own voice.

429
00:36:22,444 --> 00:36:24,000
Her voice.

430
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:25,836
The talkies debuted.

431
00:36:25,837 --> 00:36:27,328
Thank heavens.

432
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:30,308
And I guess she had this
really horrible voice.

433
00:36:30,309 --> 00:36:32,391
So the studio fired her immediately.

434
00:36:32,392 --> 00:36:33,988
She just want completely insane

435
00:36:33,989 --> 00:36:35,996
and killed all of her closest friends

436
00:36:35,997 --> 00:36:38,226
and slit her own throat

437
00:36:38,227 --> 00:36:41,039
right there over that waterfall.

438
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,623
(tense suspenseful music)

439
00:36:46,597 --> 00:36:49,588
My God that's horrible.

440
00:36:49,589 --> 00:36:53,228
Some people say that her
ghost still haunts this house.

441
00:36:53,229 --> 00:36:54,827
Other say...

442
00:36:54,828 --> 00:36:56,493
What do they say?

443
00:36:56,494 --> 00:36:59,321
That it's just too damn expensive.

444
00:36:59,322 --> 00:37:01,066
Jerk you really had me going.

445
00:37:01,067 --> 00:37:02,978
Actually some of it really is true.

446
00:37:02,979 --> 00:37:05,105
Rose was a huge star.

447
00:37:05,106 --> 00:37:07,405
The other part I don't really
know how it got started.

448
00:37:07,406 --> 00:37:09,107
Well, I know one thing

449
00:37:09,108 --> 00:37:11,423
we need to kill off this bottle.

450
00:37:11,424 --> 00:37:14,060
God this damn guy he's so late.

451
00:37:14,061 --> 00:37:15,122
I know.

452
00:37:15,123 --> 00:37:17,675
It's your call stay or go.

453
00:37:17,676 --> 00:37:20,015
[Danni] Well, if we
go we may lose the sale.

454
00:37:20,016 --> 00:37:22,492
You know these eccentric rich guys can be.

455
00:37:22,493 --> 00:37:24,502
I know I wish I was one of them.

456
00:37:24,503 --> 00:37:29,287
I say in the meantime we
party like a Pettigrew.

457
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,977
I think I will.

458
00:37:30,978 --> 00:37:32,112
Cheers.

459
00:37:32,113 --> 00:37:32,946
Cheers.

460
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:39,059
(soft melodramatic music)

461
00:38:30,351 --> 00:38:33,934
(soft melodramatic music)

462
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:18,403
(tense dramatic music)

463
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,924
[Tubby] Come out, come
out wherever you are.

464
00:39:25,925 --> 00:39:26,779
(man laughing)

465
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,177
(woman giggling)

466
00:39:28,178 --> 00:39:30,181
Come here you.

467
00:39:30,182 --> 00:39:33,015
(woman giggling)

468
00:39:34,088 --> 00:39:37,095
(man giggling)

469
00:39:37,096 --> 00:39:40,679
(tense suspenseful music)

470
00:40:26,812 --> 00:40:30,696
[Erik] What is this
flower upon our doorstep?

471
00:40:30,697 --> 00:40:34,047
A shrinking violet apparently.

472
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:36,092
[Erik] Join us.

473
00:40:36,093 --> 00:40:37,589
No thank you.

474
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,664
How goes it?

475
00:40:38,665 --> 00:40:40,583
Come on in, toots.

476
00:40:40,584 --> 00:40:43,251
(man giggling)

477
00:40:45,064 --> 00:40:45,897
Ma'am.

478
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:48,473
Have a seat.

479
00:40:48,474 --> 00:40:49,807
[Tubby] Yeah.

480
00:40:53,413 --> 00:40:55,746
For our shrinking violet.

481
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,841
Are you here for the shindig?

482
00:41:04,842 --> 00:41:06,778
Of course she's here for the party.

483
00:41:06,779 --> 00:41:07,724
I know aren't ya.

484
00:41:07,725 --> 00:41:10,464
I mean it's the premier for your premier.

485
00:41:10,465 --> 00:41:12,627
Cat got your tongue.

486
00:41:12,628 --> 00:41:14,076
I'm not here for any party.

487
00:41:14,077 --> 00:41:14,910
I'm here...

488
00:41:14,911 --> 00:41:16,265
You should stick around.

489
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:18,429
It's gonna be real swell.

490
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:21,284
We always have the best times here

491
00:41:21,285 --> 00:41:22,946
especially with such

492
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:26,238
beautiful creature as
yourself to play with.

493
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:28,967
No, honestly I don't
think you should be here.

494
00:41:28,968 --> 00:41:30,439
Where else should we be?

495
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,663
We're always here. We belong here.

496
00:41:32,664 --> 00:41:34,121
No, I don't think so.

497
00:41:34,122 --> 00:41:36,487
My partner and I are selling this house.

498
00:41:36,488 --> 00:41:38,321
Is that a fact well

499
00:41:41,877 --> 00:41:44,377
this will cure what ails you.

500
00:41:45,944 --> 00:41:46,777
Drink.

501
00:41:54,246 --> 00:41:57,398
There this is so much better

502
00:41:57,399 --> 00:41:58,863
don't you think.

503
00:41:58,864 --> 00:42:00,776
So what's with the new twist anyhow

504
00:42:00,777 --> 00:42:02,259
I ain't never seen her before.

505
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,427
Don't know.

506
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,619
What is your name, flower?

507
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,211
Reese,

508
00:42:10,212 --> 00:42:11,629
my name's Reese.

509
00:42:13,387 --> 00:42:15,970
A Reese by any other name...

510
00:42:16,806 --> 00:42:18,596
And who are you?

511
00:42:18,597 --> 00:42:20,180
You look familiar.

512
00:42:22,108 --> 00:42:24,140
From the wild west

513
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:25,308
Sonny Barnes.

514
00:42:27,354 --> 00:42:28,811
Howdy.

515
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:32,979
To the east Tubby Fitzgerald.

516
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,374
Hi ya.

517
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:37,205
And from the darkness

518
00:42:37,206 --> 00:42:39,206
Erik Burke

519
00:42:40,523 --> 00:42:42,606
at your service.

520
00:42:45,327 --> 00:42:47,810
I know I've seen all of you before.

521
00:42:47,811 --> 00:42:50,188
Everyone has lady.

522
00:42:50,189 --> 00:42:53,739
Look I'm sorry I just can't place where.

523
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,740
You will.

524
00:42:55,684 --> 00:42:57,358
You can count on that.

525
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,442
So to our new lovely friend Reese.

526
00:43:12,425 --> 00:43:13,258
Say

527
00:43:14,141 --> 00:43:16,877
what's with the costume any ways?

528
00:43:16,878 --> 00:43:18,420
Costume?

529
00:43:18,421 --> 00:43:20,671
He means the funny duds.

530
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:26,481
Studios don't like it when
you walk with their threads.

531
00:43:26,482 --> 00:43:28,565
They'll dock your pay.

532
00:43:29,789 --> 00:43:32,433
Okay, I've had about enough.

533
00:43:32,434 --> 00:43:33,796
(tense suspenseful music)

534
00:43:33,797 --> 00:43:35,896
I don't know what the
hell you're talking about

535
00:43:35,897 --> 00:43:36,855
and I don't know what you're doing here,

536
00:43:36,856 --> 00:43:38,550
but just cut the shit,
answer the question,

537
00:43:38,551 --> 00:43:42,647
and get the hell out of
here before I call the cops.

538
00:43:42,648 --> 00:43:46,500
(tense suspenseful music)

539
00:43:46,501 --> 00:43:48,668
Who are you talking to?

540
00:43:51,186 --> 00:43:53,240
Danni, call the police.

541
00:43:53,241 --> 00:43:54,613
Why what's going on?

542
00:43:54,614 --> 00:43:57,066
These men they...

543
00:43:57,067 --> 00:43:58,734
[Danni] What men?

544
00:44:00,698 --> 00:44:02,531
They were just here.

545
00:44:05,701 --> 00:44:07,994
I was just talking to them.

546
00:44:07,995 --> 00:44:09,896
You didn't see them?

547
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,447
You didn't hear me talking to them?

548
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:14,622
I heard you yelling like
crazy and it woke me up.

549
00:44:14,623 --> 00:44:15,629
Good thing too.

550
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:17,289
Danni, I swear there were...

551
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:18,372
These guys were here.

552
00:44:18,373 --> 00:44:20,932
I was just talking to them.

553
00:44:20,933 --> 00:44:23,034
I think the wine is talking now.

554
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:26,136
Dammit I'm not drunk and I'm not crazy.

555
00:44:26,137 --> 00:44:28,436
They were here. They
looked really familiar.

556
00:44:28,437 --> 00:44:30,696
I feel like I know them for somewhere.

557
00:44:30,697 --> 00:44:32,065
Well, who were they?

558
00:44:32,066 --> 00:44:33,088
I don't know I can't pin point it

559
00:44:33,089 --> 00:44:35,493
but there was this really creepy guy

560
00:44:35,494 --> 00:44:36,928
and then there was this cowboy

561
00:44:36,929 --> 00:44:39,313
and then there was this really fat guy.

562
00:44:39,314 --> 00:44:40,450
Typical.

563
00:44:40,451 --> 00:44:42,521
They were dressed like they
were going to this party.

564
00:44:42,522 --> 00:44:44,780
They kept talking about
this party, this premier.

565
00:44:44,781 --> 00:44:46,060
Like a movie premier?

566
00:44:46,061 --> 00:44:47,878
Yeah, yeah they must be actors

567
00:44:47,879 --> 00:44:50,857
that's why they looked familiar.

568
00:44:50,858 --> 00:44:52,497
You believe me don't you?

569
00:44:52,498 --> 00:44:54,115
It's Hollywood

570
00:44:54,116 --> 00:44:55,786
I'll believe anything

571
00:44:55,787 --> 00:44:57,265
especially out of work actors

572
00:44:57,266 --> 00:44:58,523
squatting in our house

573
00:44:58,524 --> 00:45:01,113
and sneaking out through the window.

574
00:45:01,114 --> 00:45:04,334
But I also believe that
our buyer hasn't shown up,

575
00:45:04,335 --> 00:45:07,341
and I don't think he's coming tonight.

576
00:45:07,342 --> 00:45:09,775
You're probably right.

577
00:45:09,776 --> 00:45:12,882
Look can we just go
home and get some sleep.

578
00:45:12,883 --> 00:45:15,898
He'll probably just contact us tomorrow.

579
00:45:15,899 --> 00:45:18,658
I was hoping we could finish tonight.

580
00:45:18,659 --> 00:45:20,258
I mean that way it's done,

581
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,918
and we don't have to worry about it.

582
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:23,652
I don't know.

583
00:45:23,653 --> 00:45:26,444
I mean we only have like an hour left

584
00:45:26,445 --> 00:45:29,337
it'll be better tomorrow.

585
00:45:29,338 --> 00:45:30,857
I'm just so tired.

586
00:45:30,858 --> 00:45:31,691
I'm seeing things.

587
00:45:31,692 --> 00:45:34,224
I can't even think straight.

588
00:45:34,225 --> 00:45:36,045
Just take it easy.

589
00:45:36,046 --> 00:45:38,080
Why don't you just finish
cleaning up down here.

590
00:45:38,081 --> 00:45:40,828
I'll do the room at the top of the stairs.

591
00:45:40,829 --> 00:45:42,412
That's it deal.

592
00:45:43,853 --> 00:45:45,309
Deal.

593
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:46,727
Just hurry okay.

594
00:45:48,169 --> 00:45:49,476
Okay.

595
00:45:49,477 --> 00:45:51,144
I'll be right back.

596
00:46:00,483 --> 00:46:03,566
(crickets chirping)

597
00:46:07,946 --> 00:46:11,196
(soft dramatic music)

598
00:46:40,692 --> 00:46:44,192
Man these people really knew how to live.

599
00:47:02,381 --> 00:47:05,631
(soft dramatic music)

600
00:47:43,972 --> 00:47:47,222
(soft dramatic music)

601
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:34,307
(soft dramatic music)

602
00:50:29,566 --> 00:50:31,723
(woman screaming)

603
00:50:31,724 --> 00:50:35,474
(powerful suspenseful music)

604
00:50:37,215 --> 00:50:38,048
Reese.

605
00:50:39,962 --> 00:50:40,795
Reese, where are you?

606
00:50:40,796 --> 00:50:41,943
[Reese] I'm right here.

607
00:50:41,944 --> 00:50:43,688
What, what, what is it?

608
00:50:43,689 --> 00:50:45,792
[Danni] I think I
saw one of your actors.

609
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:47,403
[Reese] If they're still here
we need to make them leave.

610
00:50:47,404 --> 00:50:48,237
No, they can have it.

611
00:50:48,238 --> 00:50:50,237
We have to go right now.

612
00:50:52,207 --> 00:50:54,957
Jesus, Reese, will you hurry up.

613
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:56,677
(women screaming)

614
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:57,962
[Reese] Let her go.

615
00:50:57,963 --> 00:50:58,796
(tense suspenseful music)

616
00:50:58,797 --> 00:51:01,629
(woman screaming)

617
00:51:08,497 --> 00:51:09,675
All you get back here.

618
00:51:09,676 --> 00:51:12,264
We ain't finished with ya.

619
00:51:12,265 --> 00:51:13,542
Please just let us go.

620
00:51:13,543 --> 00:51:15,489
We won't tell anyone you're here please.

621
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:17,595
[Erik] Let's get these
sweet treats downstairs.

622
00:51:17,596 --> 00:51:19,395
[Tubby] You said a mouthful.

623
00:51:19,396 --> 00:51:23,563
(woman screaming)
I'll get the other one.

624
00:51:38,092 --> 00:51:41,175
(tense piano music)

625
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:56,318
(tense organ music)

626
00:52:07,054 --> 00:52:10,044
(woman screaming)

627
00:52:10,045 --> 00:52:11,466
[Danni] No.

628
00:52:11,467 --> 00:52:13,094
No, stop

629
00:52:13,095 --> 00:52:13,928
No.

630
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:16,056
Oh, my god, no.

631
00:52:16,057 --> 00:52:17,724
Please don't please.

632
00:52:18,598 --> 00:52:19,808
Let me go.

633
00:52:19,809 --> 00:52:21,191
Let me go.

634
00:52:21,192 --> 00:52:24,716
No, stop, no.

635
00:52:24,717 --> 00:52:28,314
No, no, no.

636
00:52:28,315 --> 00:52:31,894
No, no stop it.

637
00:52:31,895 --> 00:52:34,260
Stop, no.

638
00:52:34,261 --> 00:52:36,844
(woman crying)

639
00:52:39,382 --> 00:52:41,924
[Sonny] You look like you
got a real bucking bronco.

640
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:42,966
[Erik] Don't just sit there.

641
00:52:42,967 --> 00:52:44,658
Help me chain her up.

642
00:52:44,659 --> 00:52:48,092
[Sonny] You look like you doing aight.

643
00:52:48,093 --> 00:52:49,608
(woman screaming)

644
00:52:49,609 --> 00:52:50,712
My god.

645
00:52:50,713 --> 00:52:52,880
No, god, no, no.

646
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,753
[Sonny] Poor missy.

647
00:52:57,229 --> 00:53:00,489
Gonna have a high time taming you.

648
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:01,573
Screw you.

649
00:53:04,826 --> 00:53:05,743
Screw me.

650
00:53:08,303 --> 00:53:09,136
Screw me.

651
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:12,693
Baby,

652
00:53:13,777 --> 00:53:16,768
we'll have plenty of time for that.

653
00:53:16,769 --> 00:53:18,453
(woman crying)

654
00:53:18,454 --> 00:53:21,371
(woman screaming)

655
00:53:28,566 --> 00:53:33,192
I love a gal who plays hard
to get but this is ridiculous.

656
00:53:33,193 --> 00:53:36,443
(soft dramatic music)

657
00:53:41,681 --> 00:53:45,201
I guess it's Tubby's time of play.

658
00:53:45,202 --> 00:53:46,035
Marco.

659
00:53:52,839 --> 00:53:53,672
Polo.

660
00:53:56,778 --> 00:53:57,863
Dammit.

661
00:53:57,864 --> 00:53:59,903
Come on out here already.

662
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:02,654
You're keeping everybody waiting.

663
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:11,889
(soft dramatic music)

664
00:54:26,521 --> 00:54:29,938
(woman screaming loudly)

665
00:54:48,636 --> 00:54:52,628
(woman screaming loudly)

666
00:54:52,629 --> 00:54:54,519
[Danni] Oh, god.

667
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:57,045
I don't know why you
women always gotta be

668
00:54:57,046 --> 00:54:58,546
so damn stubborn.

669
00:54:59,767 --> 00:55:02,442
[Erik] You knew your role
when you accepted the part.

670
00:55:02,443 --> 00:55:04,772
No, I don't know what
you're talking about.

671
00:55:04,773 --> 00:55:06,606
I just wanna go home.

672
00:55:07,587 --> 00:55:10,393
[Erik] Maybe this will
help you remember your line.

673
00:55:10,394 --> 00:55:11,663
(woman screaming)

674
00:55:11,664 --> 00:55:13,413
No, no, no.

675
00:55:13,414 --> 00:55:15,331
No, oh, god no.

676
00:55:17,529 --> 00:55:20,316
(man laughing)

677
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,864
[Sonny] Yeah.

678
00:55:21,865 --> 00:55:23,252
(woman screaming)

679
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:24,986
[Woman With Bow Tie]
Isn't this dreamy, honey?

680
00:55:24,987 --> 00:55:26,904
No, it's a nightmare.

681
00:55:27,836 --> 00:55:30,919
(screaming) God, no.

682
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:45,626
(screaming) God, no, no.

683
00:55:45,627 --> 00:55:47,710
No, oh, god.

684
00:55:50,645 --> 00:55:53,562
(woman screaming)

685
00:55:59,548 --> 00:56:02,298
(woman moaning)

686
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:08,339
[Sonny] Come on doll.

687
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:09,340
That a girl.

688
00:56:10,518 --> 00:56:13,351
(woman screaming)

689
00:56:16,477 --> 00:56:18,152
(man groaning)

690
00:56:18,153 --> 00:56:20,903
(woman moaning)

691
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,645
[Danni] No, no, no, no.

692
00:56:24,646 --> 00:56:25,863
Get off of me.

693
00:56:25,864 --> 00:56:26,747
Get off me.

694
00:56:26,748 --> 00:56:28,080
Get off me.

695
00:56:31,123 --> 00:56:34,623
No, no, don't leave me.

696
00:56:35,593 --> 00:56:37,239
No, get off me.

697
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,157
Get of me.

698
00:56:39,697 --> 00:56:40,843
Me and you really gotta stop

699
00:56:40,844 --> 00:56:43,847
running into each other like this.

700
00:56:43,848 --> 00:56:45,329
[Reese] Let me go.

701
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:46,966
[Tubb] You ain't getting
away this time toots.

702
00:56:46,967 --> 00:56:48,384
Ain't no way.

703
00:56:50,476 --> 00:56:52,637
Want me to lasso her for you, Tubby?

704
00:56:52,638 --> 00:56:54,421
Quit busting my hump, fellas.

705
00:56:54,422 --> 00:56:56,166
I got it. I got it.

706
00:56:56,167 --> 00:56:57,417
Are you sure?

707
00:56:58,671 --> 00:57:00,004
Sure I'm sure.

708
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,548
Now don't just stand around mugging

709
00:57:03,549 --> 00:57:05,267
go tell her we're ready already.

710
00:57:05,268 --> 00:57:06,507
We gotta be sure.

711
00:57:06,508 --> 00:57:11,164
You know how she is
about being kept waiting.

712
00:57:11,165 --> 00:57:13,582
Go get her.

713
00:57:15,096 --> 00:57:17,596
I'll get her. I'll get her.

714
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:21,613
Keep it warm for me.

715
00:57:21,614 --> 00:57:23,864
I'll be waiting so scoot.

716
00:57:26,387 --> 00:57:29,054
(man laughing)

717
00:57:29,909 --> 00:57:31,456
Come here, dolly.

718
00:57:31,457 --> 00:57:32,957
Been a long time.

719
00:57:36,133 --> 00:57:39,258
[Danni] I'm so sorry
I didn't believe you.

720
00:57:39,259 --> 00:57:40,336
It's okay.

721
00:57:40,337 --> 00:57:42,088
How could you have known.

722
00:57:42,089 --> 00:57:43,596
You've always taking care of me.

723
00:57:43,597 --> 00:57:45,677
You've never lied to me.

724
00:57:45,678 --> 00:57:49,306
Should've just done what you said.

725
00:57:49,307 --> 00:57:50,800
It's gonna be okay.

726
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:51,931
We're together now it's gonna be fine.

727
00:57:51,932 --> 00:57:55,276
[Danni] Should've just
left when you wanted to.

728
00:57:55,277 --> 00:57:56,908
Just don't freak, okay.

729
00:57:56,909 --> 00:57:58,069
I don't want you to cry.

730
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:00,903
Don't give them the satisfaction.

731
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:04,862
Boo-hoo ain't that rich.

732
00:58:04,863 --> 00:58:07,613
All you dames shut your traps.

733
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:12,691
They're gonna kill us aren't they?

734
00:58:12,692 --> 00:58:13,971
Aren't they?

735
00:58:13,972 --> 00:58:15,055
Aren't they?

736
00:58:17,272 --> 00:58:20,548
We're gonna do far worse than that.

737
00:58:20,549 --> 00:58:22,299
Like hell you will.

738
00:58:26,383 --> 00:58:28,638
You have no idea

739
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:31,222
how much we'll make you scream.

740
00:58:37,329 --> 00:58:39,134
[Danni] Is he dead?

741
00:58:39,135 --> 00:58:43,302
[Reese] We're not
sticking around to find out.

742
00:58:44,269 --> 00:58:45,102
Can you run?

743
00:58:45,103 --> 00:58:47,973
[Danni] I'll fly if I have to.

744
00:58:47,974 --> 00:58:51,807
(powerful suspenseful music)

745
00:59:07,006 --> 00:59:08,673
[Reese] Dead end.

746
00:59:10,718 --> 00:59:13,885
Darn tooten it's a dead end, yours.

747
00:59:16,598 --> 00:59:18,465
Drop her you son of a bitch.

748
00:59:18,466 --> 00:59:20,695
I like your style girly.

749
00:59:20,696 --> 00:59:22,177
But do you know

750
00:59:22,178 --> 00:59:25,335
I am the fastest draw in Hollywood.

751
00:59:25,336 --> 00:59:26,946
Gonna find out soon enough.

752
00:59:26,947 --> 00:59:29,231
Alright here's what we're gonna do.

753
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,941
We're gonna have a good old fashion dual.

754
00:59:31,942 --> 00:59:35,193
We're gonna turn back
to back, walk five paces

755
00:59:35,194 --> 00:59:38,166
one, two, three, four, five turn and kill.

756
00:59:38,167 --> 00:59:39,334
Are you ready?

757
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:45,573
One, two, three.

758
00:59:47,585 --> 00:59:49,085
You cheated girl.

759
00:59:53,145 --> 00:59:55,617
[Danni] Come on this way.

760
00:59:55,618 --> 00:59:59,368
(powerful suspenseful music)

761
01:00:06,614 --> 01:00:07,781
[Reese] No,

762
01:00:08,635 --> 01:00:10,208
Danni.

763
01:00:10,209 --> 01:00:12,792
It's a crying shame isn't it?

764
01:00:14,959 --> 01:00:18,126
Alive, dead I'm gonna have you

765
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,610
while you're being the bell of the ball,

766
01:00:22,611 --> 01:00:25,766
while you being such a pain in my ass.

767
01:00:25,767 --> 01:00:28,454
I'm going out that door
even if I have go through you.

768
01:00:28,455 --> 01:00:31,307
I'm gonna teach you respect.

769
01:00:31,308 --> 01:00:33,401
Wait, okay, this isn't fair.

770
01:00:33,402 --> 01:00:36,096
You're not even giving
me a fighting chance.

771
01:00:36,097 --> 01:00:40,097
Is the cat done playing
with the little mouse?

772
01:00:41,756 --> 01:00:42,589
Okay.

773
01:00:48,576 --> 01:00:50,261
To die by the blade of
the knife is honorable

774
01:00:50,262 --> 01:00:51,469
don't you think?

775
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:52,874
A man's way to die

776
01:00:52,875 --> 01:00:55,242
personal to see the eyes

777
01:00:55,243 --> 01:00:56,906
of the one that will take you life

778
01:00:56,907 --> 01:00:59,407
to smell his victory.

779
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,113
No.

780
01:01:04,114 --> 01:01:07,543
Then you're not gonna like
how this picture ends lady

781
01:01:07,544 --> 01:01:09,794
because I'm getting bored.

782
01:01:13,374 --> 01:01:16,124
Please, please just let us go.

783
01:01:18,315 --> 01:01:20,629
I never considered that one.

784
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:21,624
Please.

785
01:01:21,625 --> 01:01:23,541
Not a chance.

786
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:30,519
Danni.

787
01:01:32,498 --> 01:01:34,050
Come on, come on we gotta get out of here.

788
01:01:34,051 --> 01:01:36,643
Come on.

789
01:01:36,644 --> 01:01:37,863
Come on I can't carry you, Danni.

790
01:01:37,864 --> 01:01:39,768
Please gotta help me.

791
01:01:39,769 --> 01:01:41,342
No, no, no come on.

792
01:01:41,343 --> 01:01:42,676
Get up. Get up.

793
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:52,541
Action.

794
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:55,458
(woman screaming)

795
01:01:59,669 --> 01:02:02,036
(woman screaming)

796
01:02:02,037 --> 01:02:03,276
Keep screaming

797
01:02:03,277 --> 01:02:05,886
it's music to my ears.

798
01:02:05,887 --> 01:02:07,855
What baby cakes

799
01:02:07,856 --> 01:02:11,400
you thought we just rode
off into the sunset.

800
01:02:11,401 --> 01:02:13,207
It ain't the end for us.

801
01:02:13,208 --> 01:02:14,980
We're the stars.

802
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:17,936
We always survive the final reel,

803
01:02:17,937 --> 01:02:20,605
but it's curtains for you.

804
01:02:20,606 --> 01:02:22,897
No, people will be looking for me.

805
01:02:22,898 --> 01:02:24,950
There's a man he's coming here any minute.

806
01:02:24,951 --> 01:02:27,335
(man laughing)

807
01:02:27,336 --> 01:02:30,813
Would you be speaking
about the potential buyer

808
01:02:30,814 --> 01:02:33,157
of this house?

809
01:02:33,158 --> 01:02:34,426
Yes, yes, he's coming.

810
01:02:34,427 --> 01:02:35,715
He's gonna find me.

811
01:02:35,716 --> 01:02:39,085
(man laughing)

812
01:02:39,086 --> 01:02:41,479
Sorry baby cakes

813
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,686
but I don't think he's gonna make it.

814
01:02:43,687 --> 01:02:46,687
Or more likely he's here already.

815
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:50,854
One of my finest roles

816
01:02:50,855 --> 01:02:53,602
if I can be so bold.

817
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:54,702
What do you think, fellas?

818
01:02:54,703 --> 01:02:56,987
[Tubby] Bravesema.

819
01:02:56,988 --> 01:02:59,477
You can't keep me here.

820
01:02:59,478 --> 01:03:02,329
In due time you will be free

821
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:04,747
to waltz right out the door.

822
01:03:05,623 --> 01:03:09,676
Missy, you should feel mighty grateful.

823
01:03:09,677 --> 01:03:11,744
It isn't often a girl like yourself

824
01:03:11,745 --> 01:03:16,520
gets invited to such a
special premier like this.

825
01:03:16,521 --> 01:03:19,604
Hell, you're a VIP.

826
01:03:21,862 --> 01:03:24,147
You should cherish the honor.

827
01:03:24,148 --> 01:03:27,560
We have been holding casting
sessions for decades,

828
01:03:27,561 --> 01:03:29,260
but never before could we find

829
01:03:29,261 --> 01:03:33,208
such incredible beauty as yourself.

830
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:38,066
You played your part exquisitely.

831
01:03:38,067 --> 01:03:41,872
You are indeed ingenue

832
01:03:41,873 --> 01:03:46,040
and a flower that will forever bloom.

833
01:03:47,481 --> 01:03:49,845
I don't know what you're talking about.

834
01:03:49,846 --> 01:03:51,419
Think of it

835
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:55,587
you will be the new contract
girl for our little studio

836
01:03:57,122 --> 01:03:58,659
forever.

837
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:00,161
I don't know what they see in you.

838
01:04:00,162 --> 01:04:01,930
You're a dime a dozen.

839
01:04:01,931 --> 01:04:04,038
I just wanna go home.

840
01:04:04,039 --> 01:04:05,918
You are home.

841
01:04:05,919 --> 01:04:07,652
Look you can have the house.

842
01:04:07,653 --> 01:04:09,244
You can have it please just

843
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:10,328
please I won't say anything.

844
01:04:10,329 --> 01:04:12,941
I promise I won't say anything please.

845
01:04:12,942 --> 01:04:14,026
It's not the house.

846
01:04:14,027 --> 01:04:15,736
It's never been about the house.

847
01:04:15,737 --> 01:04:18,416
It's always been about you.

848
01:04:18,417 --> 01:04:20,763
A house is of mortar and brick,

849
01:04:20,764 --> 01:04:22,330
but a star

850
01:04:22,331 --> 01:04:24,638
a star is eternal.

851
01:04:24,639 --> 01:04:25,975
I'm not a star.

852
01:04:25,976 --> 01:04:27,125
I don't wanna be a star.

853
01:04:27,126 --> 01:04:28,959
I just wanna go home.

854
01:04:31,452 --> 01:04:35,178
Enough of this ingenue ass kissing.

855
01:04:35,179 --> 01:04:37,188
Let's get on with it.

856
01:04:37,189 --> 01:04:38,856
Take it away, Tubby.

857
01:04:41,091 --> 01:04:43,636
Ladies and gentlemen,

858
01:04:43,637 --> 01:04:46,793
boys and girls of all ages,

859
01:04:46,794 --> 01:04:49,921
it is our undying pleasure

860
01:04:49,922 --> 01:04:54,460
to reintroduce to you
after too long an absence

861
01:04:54,461 --> 01:04:55,827
the swellest,

862
01:04:55,828 --> 01:04:58,680
shiniest star of the silver screen

863
01:04:58,681 --> 01:05:01,416
then, now, and forever.

864
01:05:01,417 --> 01:05:03,972
Prepare yourself

865
01:05:03,973 --> 01:05:08,140
for the triumphant return
of our leading lady.

866
01:05:09,507 --> 01:05:11,088
You know her.

867
01:05:11,089 --> 01:05:12,172
You love her

868
01:05:13,987 --> 01:05:16,487
Ms. Rosy Pettigrew.

869
01:05:18,237 --> 01:05:21,487
(soft dramatic music)

870
01:06:04,443 --> 01:06:06,693
Hello, boys.

871
01:06:08,179 --> 01:06:10,990
[Sonny] You're sure
a sight for sore eyes.

872
01:06:10,991 --> 01:06:14,739
[Tubby] Hi ya, Rosy, welcome back.

873
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:17,990
Rosy, we have something for you.

874
01:06:19,444 --> 01:06:22,694
[Erik] A gift of love for our love.

875
01:06:52,178 --> 01:06:55,095
Beautiful.

876
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:59,500
Don't touch me you bitch.

877
01:07:03,174 --> 01:07:06,674
(soft melodramatic music)

878
01:07:15,218 --> 01:07:18,425
I knew she had star quality.

879
01:07:18,426 --> 01:07:21,105
Star quality you stupid mook.

880
01:07:21,106 --> 01:07:22,940
You said I have star quality

881
01:07:22,941 --> 01:07:27,024
and for what I've waited
all these years for her.

882
01:07:30,793 --> 01:07:33,626
(woman screaming)

883
01:07:34,619 --> 01:07:38,119
(woman gasping)
Golly.

884
01:07:43,909 --> 01:07:47,019
Let's get this rodeo started.

885
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:49,103
Yeah, on with the show.

886
01:07:53,548 --> 01:07:57,048
(soft melodramatic music)

887
01:08:06,004 --> 01:08:06,837
Don't.

888
01:08:16,518 --> 01:08:20,685
I have missed you for so long.

889
01:08:23,694 --> 01:08:26,611
Don't forget our supporting roles.

890
01:08:27,722 --> 01:08:29,215
Together

891
01:08:29,216 --> 01:08:31,216
forever.

892
01:08:45,589 --> 01:08:49,006
(tense climactic music)

893
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:57,787
Are you ready for your close up?

894
01:09:05,718 --> 01:09:06,551
Action.

895
01:09:11,023 --> 01:09:14,690
(powerful theatrical music)

896
01:09:23,091 --> 01:09:26,591
♪ That you broke your vow ♪

897
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:30,658
