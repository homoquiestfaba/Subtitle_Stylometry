00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,242
It must be the Kronite.

221
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,910
When it overheated,
it somehow created

They've got some
kinda plan cookin'.

598
00:28:52,865 --> 00:28:54,431

in ways your pitiful minds
could never conceive.

600

Our great race

601
00:29:00,673 --> 00:29:02,906
will reap any time
period we want.

602
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,709
We can restore
our glorious empire

603
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:08,712

you're gonna need
a dinosaur, bro.

- Nah, I'm cool
with no dinosaur.

612

I have legs. I can walk.

613

loved dinosaurs.

Not enough to ride 'em.

- What kind of dino would
be perfect for Donny?

617
00:29:40,513 --> 00:29:43,947
