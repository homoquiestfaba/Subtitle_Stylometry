1
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:47,485
We were working with local
military anti-drug forces...

2
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,428
a search and destroy
mission on cocaine labs.

3
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:54,364
Lt. Dobbs and I had trained
local pilots in Cobras...

4
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,265
for their own
strike forces.

5
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,361
This is Snake Two...

6
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,371
entering sector 407 9.

7
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,465
Advise operations
of our position.

8
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:06,636
Wilco, Dobbs.
How's the view up front?

9
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:11,047
I'll be glad
when we get out of this canyon.

10
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,616
I was flying wing
with Captain Tejada.

11
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,950
Lt. Dobbs,
the other American...

12
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:18,388
was with
Captain Mendez.

13
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:22,360
Between the 2 Cobras was
a Black Hawk helicopter...

14
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,794
with a support team
of American...

15
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,299
and South American
D.E.A. agents.

16
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,767
It was our
<i>4</i>th mission as a team.

17
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:32,430
We were entering
a new sector.

18
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,735
It was rumored
among the locals...

19
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,799
that this was an area
of offensive cartel activity...

20
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,310
but we were
used to such rumors.

21
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,746
We were 5 miles
from the objective...

22
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:45,648
when we saw the Scorpion
attack helicopter.

23
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:50,448
Dobbs, bogey at your 1 2..00.!

24
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,356
Dobbs.!

25
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:58,422
Black Hawk,
get the hell out of there.

26
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:01,763
The Black Hawk
began evasive action...

27
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,530
but the Scorpion
was too fast...

28
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,572
heavily armed,
and hard to find.

29
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,541
The pilot was
the best I'd ever seen.

30
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:14,904
I tried to pull the Scorpion
away from the Black Hawk...

31
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,778
but to no use.

32
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:19,409
He was a cold killer.

33
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,758
Tejada!

34
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,660
Wake up,
goddamn it!

35
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,663
I took the controls...

36
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:35,030
and crossed over the top of the
Scorpion before he could fire.

37
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:38,002
I made it
out of the area.

38
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:45,544
 We said the cartel
was up to something.

39
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:49,036
I'm not blaming anybody.
We're on the same side.

40
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,640
We have some
decisions to make.

41
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,710
Thank you, Mr. Preston.
That will be all.

42
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,124
May I say
something?

43
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,393
Go ahead.

44
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:10,061
I volunteered to fly
with the anti-drug forces.

45
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,661
I watched the men
in those choppers...

46
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:16,436
risk their lives for their
families and their country.

47
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:20,410
The cartel has them outpaid,
outmanned, and outgunned.

48
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:23,415
Knowing that,
they still went out.

49
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:26,475
They didn't
stand a chance.

50
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,885
They're heroes,
and they should be avenged.

51
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,117
It's more
complicated than that.

52
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,716
I think it's
very simple.

53
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,729
They killed our people
and they killed our friends.

54
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,732
Their drugs kill
Americans every day.

55
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,598
It's a war, and it's
our duty to fight.

56
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:46,001
Thank you.
You are excused.

57
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:58,113
 Does anyone else
feel as frustrated as I do?

58
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:01,985

Yes, but it's a complex problem.

59
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:05,990
 We have an executive mandate
to stop the drug cartel.

60
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:09,552
That pilot out there has
the clearest take on this mess.

61
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,792
We are at war, and we deal
with the problem as such.

62
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:15,824
Should we go back to the
same sort of operation?

63
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:19,030
The D.E.A. is fighting
a war with its hands tied...

64
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,470
and we're losing.

65
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,940
Not anymore.

66
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,443
General Olcott,
I want a task force.

67
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:28,537
- I want that operation taken out.
- Yes, sir.

68
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:33,015
My Apache crews are
trained for ground support...

69
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,178
not for
air-to-air combat.

70
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:38,189
If this enemy helicopter
is as good as we hear...

71
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:40,782
I need help
to bring him down.

72
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,192
Anything
you want.

73
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:46,754
Who is this enemy pilot,
and what's his support like?

74
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,768
I've got to have
Brad Little and his team.

75
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,202
I want them
at Fort Mitchell.

76
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,206
This is a
need-to-know operation.

77
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:58,243
All reports
eyes-only to me.

78
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,173
And that Preston...

79
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:03,580
see if you can
keep him in the mix.

80
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,207
Will do.

81
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,476
Preston?

82
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,487
Yes, sir.

83
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,956
You've seen
this bogey work.

84
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,550
Can the Apache
stand up to it?

85
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:18,120
It is the only
aircraft that will.

86
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:21,496
How soon can you
fly the bird?

87
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:24,502
I'm scheduled to start hands-on
at Fort Mitchell.

88
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,198
Olcott wants you
in this mission.

89
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,264
I believe in you.

90
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,778
- Can you handle it?
- You can count on me.

91
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,069
At ease.
Take a seat.

92
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:08,203
We've got a lot to do,
so I'll make this brief.

93
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:11,250
This is our new
combat instructor pilot...

94
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,752
Chief Warrant Officer
Brad Little.

95
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:17,084
He'll bring us up to speed
on air combat maneuvers.

96
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,293
You men know
all about...

97
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,625
air-to-ground
technique.

98
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:27,257
Now you have a new
objective in your lives...

99
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,929
and that is to become masters
of air-to-air combat tactics.

100
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:34,166
When we have
mastered these tactics...

101
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,765
we will use them
to seek out...

102
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:40,108
the forces of evil,
and kill them deader than hell.

103
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,112
We're lucky men.

104
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,708
We face the opportunity
of a lifetime.

105
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,721
I do not expect you to
throw away this opportunity.

106
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,724
I expect you to improve
every minute of my time...

107
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:55,852
by becoming the best
air-to-air pilots in the world.

108
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:59,125
You will fight as teams
of Gunners and pilots...

109
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:02,964
each more dependent on the other
than to their own mama.

110
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:10,004
Our mission has
the highest national priority.

111
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,237
I can't stress
that enough.

112
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,836
We're going against
an enemy...

113
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:16,973
who's defending
his own territory.

114
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,142
The clock
is running, folks...

115
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,719
and it's
running fast.

116
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,255
Group!
Attention!

117
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,416
Carry on.

118
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,687
Looks like a fine
group of aviators.

119
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,096
They are that,
Brad.

120
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,067
Preston showed extraordinary
courage in South America.

121
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,071

Pay special attention to him.

122
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,074
Somebody called it
a flying race car with guns...

123
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,201
but that's
bullshit.

124
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,677
It's not
that simple.

125
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,714
Put your hands
here and there...

126
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,750
put your feet
here and here.

127
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:55,150
Do not step
here or there.

128
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,988
That's it.
Crawl right in there.

129
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:09,067
Riding at 1 50 knots
through the treetops...

130
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:13,128
is like having your ass strapped
to the nose of a bullet.

131
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,901
You will be flying
like a bat out of hell...

132
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,875
shooting at the enemy...

133
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,310
dodging bullets,
missiles, rocks...

134
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,347
spears, ducks,
and geese.

135
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,940
Sounds like
a full-time job.

136
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,884
You're gonna be as busy
as a 3-peckered goat.

137
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,355
Let's get to it.

138
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,391
[ Preston ]
You really get into this, don't you?

139
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:35,986
- I love it to death.
- I can tell.

140
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,030
Heaven,
here we come.

141
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:41,066
- What do we do first?
- Is this a quiz?

142
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,398
You whole
life's a quiz.

143
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,836
Tell me the first
order of business.

144
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:49,136
Program the nav systems,
enter the laser codes...

145
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,870
punch in target
and Doppler coordinates...

146
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:55,311
initialize weapon systems,
and optimize F.L.I.R. sensors.

147
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:59,078
Good. Let's see if the
damn thing will start.

148
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,394
[ Little ] It has a roll rate
of 1 50 degrees per second...

149
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,831
so if you need to duck,
dive, or disappear...

150
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,892
this buggy will do it before
your brain can think it up.

151
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:24,340
We could crash this aircraft
at 20 G's and survive...

152
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,810
but I am not
gonna prove it to you.

153
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,175
Darn.

154
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:34,013
[ Little ] The missiles
can take out a door at 5 miles.

155
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:37,180
In air-to-air combat,
your best weapon is agility...

156
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,919
and this gunship is agile,
mobile, and hostile.

157
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:43,962
Great.

158
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,759
[ Little ]
How's the ride?

159
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,770
[ Preston ]
Unreal!

160
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,046
God.

161
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,556
You usually hide in a hole
and cause things to blow up...

162
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,157
but now you'll
move like a thief...

163
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,559
keep your nose down...

164
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,232
then come out of nowhere
and blow your enemy to pieces.

165
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:27,069
- Sound like fun?
- Yeah.

166
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,468
- Sir?
- Yeah?

167
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,527
That was
totally cool.

168
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,573
I'd marry
that thing.

169
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:04,974
I'll give away
the bride. Buzzard!

170
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:08,411
MeetJake Preston,
part of the Apache force.

171
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,176
This is Scott Buzz,
my chief scout I.P....

172
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,514
and Billie Guthrie,
his copilot.

173
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,422
Billie Lee Guthrie.

174
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,424
I think I've
heard of you.

How you doin'?

176
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,623
I do fine.

177
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,264
How about a drink
this evening?

178
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,529
Jake,
not a chance.

179
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,504
''Not a chance.''

180
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:36,439
- How much flight time did you log?
- 2.3.

181
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:39,238
- What?
- 2.3, sir.

182
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,307
2.3.

183
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:47,078
- You have a problem with women in the army?
- Not with all of them.

184
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:49,120
Just that one.

185
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,491
I'll see you
at 07 00.

[ Daniels ] The cartel has made
the decision to go...

187
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:02,363
on the offensive and expand
into neighboring countries.

188
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:05,164
They've brought in Cuban
arms and an advisory team.

189
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,934
They've hired Eric Stoller,
a crack pilot and mercenary...

190
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,602
to ride shotgun
on their missions.

191
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:15,943
His terrorist training
was in Europe and North Korea.

192
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,573
Now he sells his expertise
to the highest bidder.

193
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:22,018
In this tape, our D.E.A. team
thought they had him cornered...

194
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,021
but it was a setup.

195
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,217
Stoller acted as a decoy
and drew them in.

196
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:32,190
There's a booby-trapped bomb
waiting for those men.

197
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,961
[ Daniels ] Watch for the box
at the bottom of the screen.

198
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,698
Everyone in Washington
knows what we're up against.

199
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,932
This guy's
a killer.

200
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,637
We need to support
the D.E.A....

201
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:49,976
and that means dealing
with Stoller air-to-air.

202
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,609
I'd like to be considered
for the Apache task force.

203
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,619
I need you here.

204
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,655
Nobody better
than I am.

205
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,351
It's your job to convey
that knowledge and experience...

206
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,621
to these young pilots.

207
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,526
When the time comes to use the experience,
I want to fly this mission.

208
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:07,531
- Is Janet joining you?
- This afternoon.

209
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,727
- You want to fly and get shot at?
- Affirmative.

210
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,734
We can't afford
to lose you.

211
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,171
-Just one drink.
- No.

212
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,738
It's your birthday.
Let's have fun.

213
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,508
I'm 40 years old,
and I want to go home.

214
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,646
At ease, Little.

215
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:34,091
Everybody does what they
want on their birthday.

216
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,491
Surprise!

217
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:39,224

220
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,239
Go for it.

221
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,805
This is
really stupid.

222
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,050
- Yeah!
- All right!

223
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,297
How about
that drink now?

224
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,669
Interested?

225
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,572
Uh, no, thanks.

Welcome to the future.

Descend the stairway
and turn right.

No, thanks.

Strawberry gum?

No.

Come on,Jake.

00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:21,224
This simulator will do
anything the Apache will do.

241
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,292
It will also do anything
your enemy will do.

242
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:28,601
Good, because I have
a pocket full of quarters.

Let's go play.

- Set up X-ray.
- Yes, sir.

This program is called ''X-ray. ''

All systems are up.
The pilot has the controls.

00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,625
- We can just be best of friends.
- Good.

350
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:59,101
What are
you doing?

351
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:02,504
It's a tradition for friends
to seal a bargain with a kiss.

352
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:05,805
The tradition
is a handshake.

353
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:09,780
- You can't resist me.
- I can try.

354
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,643
Aren't you
forgetting something?

355
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,186
You keep them.

356
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:48,275
- Good morning.
- Morning.

357
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:52,489
- Morning, Chief Little.
- Morning.

358
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:54,752
- Yo, Chief!.
- Morning.

359
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,828
Good pacing!

360
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:59,728
Beautiful day, sir!

361
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:16,076
[ Little ] Whoever sees
the other first is the winner.

362
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:18,877
Whoever gets seen first
is toast.

363
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:23,752
The land mass behind which
you can hide is your friend.

364
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:27,258
The open sky in which
you cannot hide is your enemy.

365
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,619
Just remember this:

366
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:33,095
once a battle has been engaged,
somebody is gonna die.

367
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:37,100
You do not have the speed
to run from a fight.

368
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:39,102
When you engage...

369
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:44,107
you must bring the nose of your
aircraft to bear on the bogey.

370
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:48,909
Unmasking, pop-ups,
pedal turns, hovers...

371
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:51,040
could all
be combined...

372
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:53,710
to effect your
nose-on position.

373
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:57,619
Put your weapons on the target.
The optimum attack position is?

374
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:00,124
Above and behind
on a 6:00.

375
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:03,889
- The optimum kill shot is...?
- Down through the rotor blades.

376
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:06,590
Some of you have been
paying attention.

377
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:09,031
I thought you were all
dreaming about women.

378
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,034
You're dismissed.

379
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:16,167
Stay out
of trouble.

For 5 long years

386
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:43,767
I thought I was
your man

387
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:46,770
What kind of women
do you think come here?

388
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:49,272
I don't know.
Scandalous women.

389
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:53,744
- The kind that you like, Breaker.
- You, too,Jake...

390
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:56,747
because
there's Billie.

391
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:03,784
You treated me
oh so mean, baby

392
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:06,653
' You treated me
oh so cruel...''

393
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:09,819
- Excuse me.
- Back off, slick.

394
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:12,158
I want to dance
with the lady.

395
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,789
Get in line.

396
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:17,266
While the music's
playing, she's mine.

397
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:20,168
When it stops,
I'll let her go.

398
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:26,370
You wouldn't get between
a man and his fiancee.

399
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:28,241
Oh,Jake.

400
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:32,208
Take your
best shot.

401
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,223
Billie.

402
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:47,429
Hey.

403
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:52,399
- Stay away,Jake.
- I just wanted to dance with you.

404
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:56,201
I'm not a piece of steak
for you two to fight over.

405
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:58,936
Understand?

406
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:05,807
We don't go out
together anymore.

407
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:08,079
That's going
to change.

408
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,451
It's gonna
work now?

409
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:14,420
- Too many things haven't changed.
- Like what?

410
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:17,325
Like that Neanderthal
crap back there:

411
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:21,923
''Me man, you woman.''
I am notJane of the jungle.

412
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:25,298
I thought it was kind
of cavalier, myself.

413
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:30,103
I think you want me to stay home
and have babies and cook.

414
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:33,736
What's wrong with
babies and cooking?

415
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:36,008
It's a tradition.

416
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:37,878
My mother
did that.

417
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:40,247
Your mother didn't
fly helicopters.

418
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:44,955
Too many things
haven't changed.

419
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:49,289
She never flew helicopters.
What else hasn't changed?

420
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,386
- We fight all the time.
- We always make up.

421
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,864
Because I always
wanted to.

422
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:58,959
You still care
about me, don't you?

423
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:01,505
I want you
to stop this.

424
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,300
I'm going.

425
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:09,142
- I have a flight test at 0500.
- Don't you?

426
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:13,776
What if I do?
You think it changes anything?

427
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:20,115
Intelligence says the site will
be functional in a few days.

428
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:23,286
It has become the headquarters
for their operation.

429
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,829
It would support
an attack force...

430
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:28,127
even fighter
aircraft.

431
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,862
[ Olcott ]
We've accelerated our plan.

432
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,233
These were taken
a few days ago.

433
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:36,865
All the major players in
the cartel have disappeared.

434
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,876
We believe that they will
show up at this airstrip.

435
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,139
Your Apaches
should be ready.

436
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,580
Will do,
General.

437
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:50,443
[ Buzz ] The crew
and team assignments are..

438
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:53,491
Preston and Breaker
with Guthrie...

439
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,822
Davis and Proctor
go with me...

440
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:58,020
Rives and Tippet
with Wade.

441
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:02,293
Listen up, gun bunnies,
straight from the buzz man.

442
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:05,302
Just like Indian scouts
in the old days...

443
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:09,397
we're the modern day equivalent,
your eyes and your ears.

444
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,442
We stick
our necks out...

445
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,443
to see what's
out there.

446
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:15,877
Preston...

447
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:18,883
get your brains
out of your pants.

448
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,079
I can find
a target fast.

449
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,884
[ Preston ]
Let's talk about us.

450
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,551
[ Billie ] No,Jake.
To prevent radio detection...

451
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,523
we're set up
with A.T.H.S....

452
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,588
direct to your
video display.

453
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:36,459
[Jake ] I've got a display of your tail
that is mind-boggling.

454
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:40,300
Think of us scouts
as extensions of your own sight.

455
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:44,034
I like that.
You only have eyes for me.

456
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:47,407
You will need reconnaissance
going into battle.

457
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:50,243
With our laser
designator...

458
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:53,375
we can paint your target while
you're hidden in some canyon.

459
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:57,252
You can nail it from cover
without ever being seen.

460
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,449
In an emergency...

461
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:02,924
it's possible to distract
the adversary...

462
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:05,622
or temporarily blind him
with the laser.

463
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,297
Watch this.

464
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:11,129
- Where are you?
- You like me on top.

465
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:15,971
Jake,you still got your
brains in your cockpit?

466
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,440
[Jake ]
It's easier to fly that way...

467
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:20,569
loaded and
ready to fire.

468
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:24,445
[ Billie ] We've both been there
when those guns didn't go off.

469
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:27,450
Don't worry
about that, baby.

470
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:32,423
[Jake ]
How about that drink tonight?

471
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,954
You never let up.

472
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,291
-Jake, get hold of ourselves.
- I've got a hold of myself.

473
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:43,266
[ Billie ] Then you don't need me.
Have fun with yourselves.

474
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:47,034
Billie?

475
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:50,097
- Where'd she go?
- Try to catch me.

476
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:53,166
That darn girl
disappeared.

477
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,144
She's got you.

478
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:58,637
[Jake ]
She sure does, Breaker.

479
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,387
I see you took
Preston up to zulu.

480
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:07,583
Had a hell
of a score.

481
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:11,128
Has a decision been reached
on my request to join them?

482
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:13,425
Brad, I'm sorry.

483
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:17,229
Combat's a
young man's game.

484
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:19,167
I'm the best
you've got.

485
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,171
It wasn't easy
for me, either.

486
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:22,729
Give it up.

487
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,746
- Hi.
- Hi, there.

488
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:43,152
- Want to go a couple of rounds?
- No, thanks.

489
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:45,195
Breaker,
do you box?

490
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:47,629
That kind of stuff
scares me.

491
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:50,634
I'm more into
cooking and cleaning.

492
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:53,193
''Cooking
and cleaning.''

493
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,531
You're dropping your
right with your jab...

494
00:32:57,608 --> 00:33:00,372
- leaving yourself wide open.
- I don't think so.

495
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:02,504
Wide open.

496
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,549
You're talking to the former
light heavyweight champion...

497
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:08,552
of South Eastern Arizona
State University, 1 969...

498
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:11,680
intramural.

499
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:14,384
You're in a world
of trouble now.

500
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,483
Come on,
let's go.

501
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:20,696
Okay, a couple
of rounds.

502
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:23,461
Show me those
keenly-honed reflexes...

503
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:26,059
those catlike moves.

504
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,255
[Janet ]
Ready for some coffee?

505
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,334
Mm-hmm.

506
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:01,202
- You slept in this morning.
- Mm-hmm.

507
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:04,469
Honey,
what happened?

508
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,841
Nothing.
My back's a little sore.

509
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,570
What'd you do
to your eye?

510
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:13,139
I hit it.

511
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,583
With a
2-by-4?

512
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:17,416
No.

513
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,854
Boxing a little
down at the gym.

514
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:22,251
With Mike Tyson?

515
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:25,659
Ha, ha, ha.
How much time do I have?

516
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,631
- 1 0 minutes. Want some cereal?
- No.

517
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,259
I'll get something later.

518
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:33,701
Here.

519
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:43,611
Are you sure
you're okay?

520
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:46,878
I'm fine, okay?
Just a little sore.

521
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:50,178
- Maybe I pulled a muscle.
- Are you sure?

522
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:53,087
You'd think I had
my dick shot off.

523
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:56,820
I'd better check,
don't you think?

524
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:59,454
You better see
for yourself.

525
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,766
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

526
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:14,608
- Everything cool?
- Totally cool.

527
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,169
Good.

528

[ Little ] We have some snapshots
of a special individual.

529
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:26,580
His name is Eric Stoller.
Charming, isn't he?

530
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:29,353
Here he is on one
ofhis better days.

531
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,190
This man kills
people for money...

532
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:35,265
and someone has
paid him to kill you.

533
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,200
In air-to-air combat,
he has no equal.

534
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,397
His instrument
of choice...

535
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,406
is the Scorpion tactical
assault helicopter.

536
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,409
Don't let the size of
this aircraft fool you.

537
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,877
Because of its
speed and agility...

538
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:53,179
it is one of the most deadly things
you will ever see in the sky.

539
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:55,879
Put this personality
into this machine...

540
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:59,582
and if you blink up there,
you are in the body bag.

541
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:06,629
[ From TV] Law enforcement agencies
moved in unison today...

542
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:10,155
in a series of sweeping raids
of suspected crack houses.

543
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:13,601
Officers say that despite
the 2 4 arrests made today...

544
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,663
and the bust
made last week...

545
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:19,232
which netted over
$500,000 in cash and cocaine...

546
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:23,907
they are overwhelmed by
the massiveness of a problem...

547
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:26,473

to have no end.

Well,
good morning.

2 bowls, sir.

553
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:02,945
Good. All right.
Welcome to the bag.

554
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,989
- Thank you.
- You'll be flying in darkness...

sighting system.

556
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,818
- Do your homework?
- Yes, sir.

557
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,420
Good.

558
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:19,292

Don't second-guess
the equipment.

What you see
with your right eye...

566
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:50,692

You've got us close enough
to the rocks to count lizards.

I can't focus.

574
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:15,055

sky jock I had last week?

What you're talking about
is not a flying problem.

621
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:52,581
It's eye dominance.

622

We all have one eye
that naturally takes over.

00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,756
My dad always shot
the way you just did.

If I was left-eye
dominant --

626

Your instincts are so good, you
remind me of me 20 years ago.

a conventional helicopter...

means diddley.

00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:11,203
Try to maintain
zero degrees of steering.

693
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:15,974
I do not want to destroy
any U.S. government property.

694
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,981
90 degrees of steering
to the hard right, now!

695
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:22,445
See how easy
that is?

696
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:25,978
It's all about control,
and control is in your mind.

697
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,421
Turn right.

698
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:28,981
Very good.

699
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,289
I would
avoid that tank.

700
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:35,161
[ Breaker] Wouldn't this be better
if we were all blindfolded?

701
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,359
Well done.

702
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:41,131
I lost just a little control,
but now everything's cool.

703
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:44,537
Right turn coming up,
<i>9</i>0 degrees.

Yee-haw!

708
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:56,218
Better driving
than usual.

709
00:45:57,287 --> 00:46:01,155
This will be a failure
if we all die.

710
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:05,121
Road's to the right.

711
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:09,525
I found the road.

712
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:17,835
Well done.

me through it this time?

728

for a smooth ride, Mr. Preston.

729

What do you think,
big boy?

733
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:27,127
Well, I'd have to say that
I'm doing piss-perfect.

How do you feel?

735
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:39,442
I don't feel...

- Driving.

Okay, hot-rod.

There's nothing out here.

00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:43,223
[ Little ]
Get ready, Rice.

868
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:45,227
We're gonna
park it here.

869
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,657
I've lost him,Jake.

870
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,755
He's vertical,
over the top.

871
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:54,659
- Let's get 'em.
- He'll pop through that notch.

872
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:57,069
[Jake ]
He's hiding in a hole.

873
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:00,007
I'll give him
vertical with a twist.

874
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:06,113
[Jake ]
Look who we found.

875
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:07,672
''Hasta la bye-bye.''

876
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,217
Nose down,
Breaker.

877
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:10,980
- Lock.
- Now!

878
00:58:11,054 --> 00:58:13,284
[ Breaker ]
Missiles's gone.

879
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:15,684
Shit!

880
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:18,886
He's toast.
Great flying.

881
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:22,489
Rattler, they just
notified your next of kin.

882
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:25,659
I got your next ofkin.

883
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:27,633
Well done, boys.

884
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:29,103
Let's get supper.

885
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:32,606
[ Little ]
Good flying, Preston.

886
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:36,544
Intelligence reports the cartel
offensive is set to launch.

887
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:40,105
All the major players are there,
but we don't know for how long.

888
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,913
We can't let them slip
through our fingers.

889
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:45,921
- How much time do we have?
- We must move immediately.

890
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:51,086
- We have less than 2 <i>4</i> hours
to eliminate this threat.
- Any word on Stoller?

891
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,596
He's there, making sure
we don't get near them.

892
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:59,761
Morning, troopers.
Let's do it.

893
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:03,136
Task force,
attention!

894
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:06,699
At ease.
Listen up.

895
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:10,303
In 2 4 hours, you'll be asked
to use what you've learned here.

896
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,879
Our mission is
to fly support...

897
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:15,645
for a D.E.A. operation
of critical importance..

898
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:19,347
Operation Fire Bird.
We launch immediately.

899
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:22,217
We move out
tomorrow morning....

900
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:26,160
for a staging area
in South America.

901
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:28,720
Once we're
on the ground...

902
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:31,961
you'll get your
operations order.

903
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:34,764
What I can
tell you now...

904
00:59:34,837 --> 00:59:37,829
is that we will
be going air-to-air...

905
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:42,208
against a Scorpion attack
helicopter and its backup.

906
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:44,678
There'll be officials
on hand down there...

907
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:46,682
to arrest
cartel leaders.

908
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:49,082
Our job is
to make damn sure...

909
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:51,177
they get
that chance.

910
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:54,121
That's all.
Let's get hot.

911
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:58,058
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Colonel.

912
00:59:58,127 --> 01:00:00,994
- Good luck.
- Right,Jake.

913
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:04,295
Brad, I've reviewed
the gun-camera tapes...

914
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:06,733
from your
training flights.

915
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:10,704
Every man has got his
place of maximum effect.

916
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:13,300
Brad Little's is
with this task force...

917
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:16,709
flying the mission.
You're my flight leader.

918
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:22,308
I knew that.

919
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:30,618
I want to
talk to you.

920
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:35,426
- We can talk on the flight down.
- What do you mean?

921
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:38,327
On the flight
to South America.

922
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:40,926
How the hell
did that happen?

923
01:00:41,004 --> 01:00:43,097
I asked and
A.K. cleared it.

924
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:45,674
You're going
into combat?

925
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:48,074
I don't believe
I'm hearing this.

926
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:51,012
You think it's fine
for me to be a pilot...

927
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,207
when there's
nothing at stake...

928
01:00:53,249 --> 01:00:55,774
but dangerous missions
are only for men.

929
01:00:55,852 --> 01:00:58,719
Thanks,Jake.
I have my orders.

930
01:00:58,755 --> 01:01:02,782
Why is it so hard
for you to understand...

931
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:04,918
that I just don't
want you to get hurt?

932
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:08,725
You, my friend,
have to accept it.

933
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:10,823
''My friend''?

934
01:03:10,253 --> 01:03:13,313
[ Daniels ] The Bisante cartel
has been amassing heavy arms...

935
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:16,187
for an attack on
a friendly government.

936
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:20,093
Every operation
that the D.E.A...

937
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:23,063
and our South American allies
have mounted has been blown away...

938
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:25,532
- by Eric Stoller.
- They're airlifting...

939
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:29,499
some major figures in the
cartel under Stoller's cover.

940
01:03:29,572 --> 01:03:32,905
The local government is tired of
having their army chewed up...

941
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:34,237
by this guy.

942
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,244
They've asked
for your help.

943
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:38,246
They're counting
on you.

944
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:40,442
On your feet.
Get some sleep.

945
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,892
- Sleep well?
- Hell, no.

946
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:35,937
What do
you think?

947
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:38,940
It all depends on things
we don't know right now.

948
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:43,502
You train and you
know you're capable...

949
01:04:43,579 --> 01:04:47,140
but when it comes time,
you wonder what you'll do;

950
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:49,616
whether you'll take it up
or bring it down...

951
01:04:49,685 --> 01:04:51,949
or whether you'll
ever see an orange again.

952
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:53,648
Makes for
a long night.

953
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,222
That night's been around
for thousands of years...

954
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:58,658
full of men waiting
to go into battle.

955
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:01,659
I think they've all been
talking all night long.

956
01:05:01,931 --> 01:05:04,559
Yeah.

957
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:08,092
You got chops you
haven't even dreamed of.

958
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:11,196
Your instincts and
training will take over.

959
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:14,368
Count on it.
You had a brilliant teacher.

960
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:17,105
I've been pretty
arrogant with you.

961
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:19,010
Mm-hmm.

962
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:21,573
I know I'm great,
but you're the best.

963
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:25,087
No, you're better.
I can't learn anymore.

964
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:27,349
Every time we went up
I kept thinking...

965
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:30,358
''How'd that kid
figure that one out?''

966
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:32,656
You're a natural.

967
01:05:32,728 --> 01:05:35,424
You've got
a lot of talent.

968
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:39,725
How about that roll-out
you did during the fly-off?

969
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:44,234
- Only you could do that.
- I'm not saying I'm not a genius.

970
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:47,242
I joined the army for
the same reason you did:

971
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:51,007
to kick ass, like in
the old war movies.

972
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:54,049
That's what I'm
looking for in you.

973
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:56,142
An All-American hero...

974
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:58,379
with his heart and
brain wired together...

975
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:01,252
cooking full tilt
for freedom and justice.

976
01:06:01,324 --> 01:06:04,259
It's the corniest story
in the whole world.

977
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:07,329
By God, this could
be a happy day.

978
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:13,762
[ P.A. System ]
We're under attack.!

979
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:16,733
Let me repeat,
we are under attack.!

980
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:19,441
Billie,
Colonel...

981
01:06:19,508 --> 01:06:21,408
incoming
missiles.!

982
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,468
Let's get 'em
in the air!

983
01:06:28,684 --> 01:06:31,084
Get the helicopters
in the air!

984
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:49,635
Get up,
get up!

985
01:06:49,705 --> 01:06:52,401
[ Billie ]
Scott's dead. I'm on my own.

986
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:51,066
[ Little ]
This is Rattler. Do you copy?

987
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,691
Night Rider Six.

988
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:54,292
How many?

989
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:57,396
They shot down Rives
and Tippet on take-off.

990
01:07:57,473 --> 01:07:59,600
Davis and Proctor are
with the Black Hawks.

991
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:07,879
[ Little ]
Guthrie,you have...

992
01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:11,086
two bad boys looking
for something to do.

993
01:08:11,153 --> 01:08:12,848
Locate ground radar.

994
01:08:12,888 --> 01:08:15,482
When you find it,
we'll blow it up.

995
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:18,356
I don't want them
knowing where we're at.

996
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:20,224
[ Billie ]
Roger, Rattler.

997
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:23,355
Rebel is hunting.

998
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:31,330
Found it.
Site unmanned.

999
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:33,375
Proceed to 3 708.

1000
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:35,343
We're on our way.

1001
01:08:36,579 --> 01:08:39,548
[Jake ]
Stoller's out there. I can smell him.

1002
01:08:39,582 --> 01:08:42,176
Go find him, kid.

1003
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:44,913
[ Little ]
We're coming up on the coordinates.

1004
01:08:45,154 --> 01:08:48,612
Find me some high-tech
shit on that canyon.

1005
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:52,218
- Rice man.
- I see it.

1006
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:54,922
Locking in
the missiles.

1007
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:57,188
[ Little ]
Make it go away.

1008
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:04,366
Good shootin'.

1009
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:07,170
[ Little ]
What's happening, Guthrie?

1010
01:09:10,412 --> 01:09:12,346
[ Billie ]
There it is.

1011
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:15,542
[ Little ]
What's happening?

1012
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:18,587
Rebel's located airstrip.
Evacuation underway.

1013
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:20,849
Request fire support.

1014
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:26,622
Fast-mover bogey
at heading 07 0.

1015
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:29,357
This area
is heavily armed.

1016
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:31,490
Apaches rolling in hot.

1017
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,433
[ Little ]
That's yours, Stinger.

1018
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:38,869
[ Billie ]
I'm picking up something else.

1019
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:41,739
It's Stoller!

1020
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:44,404
[Jake ]
Keep moving.

1021
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,381
Don't give him
a target.

1022
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:51,210
God.

1023
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:56,223
He's closing!

1024
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:59,591
If you keep moving,
he can't lock on.

1025
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:01,289
I'm on my way.

1026
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,360
Oh,Jake,
save my ass.

1027
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:10,905

you filthy piece of shit.

1028
01:10:15,644 --> 01:10:17,874
[ Breaker]
Don't let him get away.

1029
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:25,779
- Have you engaged?
- We're on him.

1030
01:10:26,755 --> 01:10:28,746
[ Little ]
Grab your ass.

1031
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:35,989
[Jake ]
You've gotta nail him.

1032
01:10:38,534 --> 01:10:40,525
- Missed!
- Stay on him.

1033
01:10:40,636 --> 01:10:42,831
[ Breaker] Shit!

1034
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:45,669
[ Breaker]
He's getting away!

1035
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:48,005
[Jake ]
Damn, he's fast.

1036
01:11:01,624 --> 01:11:03,353
Where is he?

1037
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:05,519
[ Breaker]
I hear him.

1038
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:08,826
[Jake ]
That's not Stoller.

1039
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:10,865
[ Breaker]
I got him.

1040
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:17,266
We've got a fast-mover,
coming hot and heavy.

1041
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:21,606
[ Little ]
Listen to your old coach.

1042
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:25,477
Bring him to me, and Rice
will punch his lights out.

1043
01:11:25,547 --> 01:11:28,482
[ Breaker ]
We'll never make it.

1044
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:31,383
[ Little ]
Lead him on and bring him to us.

1045
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:33,479
Get me closer.

1046
01:11:33,555 --> 01:11:36,615
[ Little ]
I don't want to lose this kid.

1047
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:39,058
If I could get
around that ridge.

1048
01:11:40,496 --> 01:11:43,556
- He's on us!
- Down on 3.

1049
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:46,601
Stay on him.
We got him.

1050
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:48,830
- Missile lock!
- We're there.

1051
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:51,873
Look for
the sweet spot.

1052
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:54,431
Lock on.!

1053
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:02,984
Not bad shootin'
for an old dog like you.

1054
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:05,612
Thanks, Grandpa.

1055
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:07,645
Solid gold,
Rattler.

1056
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:10,590
What goes on,
Guthrie?

1057
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:12,786
Unmasking
to take a peek.

1058
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:15,762
Fast-mover
at your 1 :00.

1059
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:20,061
They got a whole
air force down here?

1060
01:12:20,135 --> 01:12:23,434
- It's Stoller!
- He's on our 6!

1061
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:27,141
- He's tracking Little.
- Coming around.

1062
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:29,936
[ Little ]
We're gonna get shot at.

1063
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:31,570
Where is he?

1064
01:12:34,783 --> 01:12:38,014
We lost the
tail rotor!

1065
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:40,351
How's the
main rotor?

1066
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:41,980
RPM dropping!

1067
01:12:42,991 --> 01:12:45,926
[Jake ]
I'm pulling Stoller out.

1068
01:12:45,994 --> 01:12:48,554
- He's on our ass.
- Oh, yeah?

1069
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:50,996
Mayday,
mayday!

1070
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,625
This is Rattler.
We are going in.

1071
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:55,762
Hang on, big boy.

1072
01:12:55,838 --> 01:12:57,931
Mayday!
We are going in.

1073
01:12:58,006 --> 01:13:00,440
[ Rice ]
Find us a soft spot.

1074
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:10,609
He missed!

1075
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:13,519
[Jake ]
Billie, check on Rattler.

1076
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:17,616
[ Billie ]
He's in sight. There was no fire.

1077
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:20,423
I'm going in to see
if they're alive.

1078
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:29,629
That make
you nervous?

1079
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:32,003
[ Breaker]
Stoller's making me nervous.

1080
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:34,736
[Jake ]
We're out of here.

1081
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:52,160
- How's it going, Calvin?
- Only my mother calls me that.

1082
01:13:52,227 --> 01:13:55,196
I am your mother now, Calvin.

1083
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:15,476
- Rice?
- Dead.

1084
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:19,248
- Can you move?
- My legs are broken.

1085
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:23,053
Get your ass
in here.

1086
01:14:28,197 --> 01:14:30,961
See if we have
a good stinger.

1087
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:33,127
He's on us.

1088
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:37,231
Not for long.

1089
01:14:37,272 --> 01:14:39,797
This one
looks okay.

1090
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:41,843
Get the grip stock
and the B.C.U.

1091
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:43,878
What?

1092
01:14:43,946 --> 01:14:46,244
A cigar-box
looking thing...

1093
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:49,508
and a round thing that
looks like a coffee can.

1094
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:51,018
20 seconds.

1095
01:14:51,086 --> 01:14:55,045
Screw it into
that cigar box.

1096
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:57,591
Pop 3 latches
on that missile.

1097
01:15:01,964 --> 01:15:04,228
[Jake ]
Let's wax him.!

1098
01:15:10,305 --> 01:15:11,795
Shit.!

1099
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:14,707
Put the flat end
in the dirt.

1100
01:15:14,776 --> 01:15:16,903
Point the
pistol grip down.

1101
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:19,504
Hinge the cigar box
onto the missile.

1102
01:15:19,581 --> 01:15:20,980
Okay.

1103
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:22,984
Pop that latch.

1104
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:25,851
Open up the square
thing on the side.

1105
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:28,651
He's turning
inbound.

1106
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:32,125
Put it on
your shoulder...

1107
01:15:32,227 --> 01:15:34,320
and pull down the metal thing
with your right thumb.

1108
01:15:34,596 --> 01:15:36,587
You are now
activated.!

1109
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:42,170
Guthrie,
turn around.

1110
01:15:45,574 --> 01:15:48,600
- He's in my sight!
- Shoot him in the ass.

1111
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:57,316
Snort that,
sucker.

1112
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:05,659
We got him.

1113
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:12,626
- He's going vertical.
- Where'd he go?

1114
01:16:12,701 --> 01:16:14,760
He's in the sun.

1115
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:23,041
He's on our ass!

1116
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:25,842
Get ready to throw
the dog a bone.

1117
01:16:27,382 --> 01:16:29,612
He's getting
position!

1118
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,057
I'm hit!

1119
01:16:36,124 --> 01:16:40,060
- How bad?
- I can't shoot.

1120
01:16:40,128 --> 01:16:43,154
[Jake ]
Hang tight. He's mine.

1121
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:46,234
Come on.
Come to daddy.

1122
01:16:47,903 --> 01:16:49,768
[Jake ]
Brace yourself.

1123
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:52,671
Let's see how good
he really is.

1124
01:16:56,244 --> 01:16:58,178
Oops,
you blew it.

1125
01:16:59,214 --> 01:17:01,273
I'm gonna
kill him now!

1126
01:17:15,063 --> 01:17:18,294
That was for Dobbs.

1127
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:26,206
 Request permission
to join Fire Bird support at airstrip.

1128
01:17:26,274 --> 01:17:29,402
 D.E.A. troops
are mopping up Fire Bird now.

1129
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:33,672
They've arrested
all cartel members.

1130
01:17:33,749 --> 01:17:36,274
Once you took out Stoller,
it was over.

1131
01:17:36,351 --> 01:17:38,376
Come on home.

1132
01:17:54,436 --> 01:17:56,961
Where's Billie
and Little?

1133
01:17:57,039 --> 01:17:59,234
We just got
confirmation on them.

1134
01:17:59,307 --> 01:18:01,935
They're alive.
Rice is dead.

1135
01:18:02,044 --> 01:18:04,478
Little is hurt,
but Billie's with him.

1136
01:18:04,746 --> 01:18:07,408
That medevac bird
is leaving.

1137
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:10,144
You're gonna
miss the bus.

1138
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:12,209
All right.

1139
01:19:24,559 --> 01:19:26,789
Christ, this hurts.

1140
01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:30,263
- Where's the meat wagon?
-Just over the hill.

1141
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:34,391
You drop me,
it'll be the end of life...

1142
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:36,494
in the army for you.

1143
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:38,535
Did you kill him?

1144
01:19:38,573 --> 01:19:40,939
Yeah, I killed him.

1145
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:44,901
Good, son.
Well done.

1146
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:47,813
You look like a first-class hero, Chief.

1147
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:50,283
You, too. You both do.

1148
01:19:50,352 --> 01:19:54,118

First-class, All-American!

1149
01:19:57,192 --> 01:19:59,956

You did it.

1150
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:01,893
We did it.

1151
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:04,056
Okay, we did it.

1152
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:06,966
I'm not gonna argue.

1153
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:09,970
Oh, yeah? Since when?

1154
01:20:10,038 --> 01:20:12,199

I'll give you a ride home.

1155
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:15,801
- Great. I'll drive.
- No, I'm driving.

1156
01:20:15,911 --> 01:20:19,813
- I'll drive.
- It's my helicopter. I'll drive.

1157
01:20:19,881 --> 01:20:22,509
No, no. I drive.

1158
01:20:22,584 --> 01:20:26,884
'Find a way to my heart '

1159
01:20:26,955 --> 01:20:30,482
'And I will
always be with you '

1160

not easy for you '

'I know '

1169
01:21:08,063 --> 01:21:11,055
'If your footsteps
get too faint to hear '

1170
01:21:11,132 --> 01:21:15,000
'I'll go '

1171
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:16,526
' 'Cause you know '

1172
01:21:16,605 --> 01:21:20,132
' Questions are
never that easy '

1173
01:21:20,242 --> 01:21:23,040
'And never
the same '

1174
01:21:24,412 --> 01:21:28,348
' Well,you have
the answer, believe me '

1175
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:30,646

the faith '

' There is a code
to be broken '

1191
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:32,571
