1
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,600
Plenty of police cruisers out.
We can knock off.

2
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,640
Come on.

3
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,800
We're NSA, field work isn't our job.
Let's go home.

4
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,960
I want dinner and a hot bath
waiting for me.

5
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,000
And wear that black G-string.

6
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,400
I told you, I love you.
I'm not in love with you.

7
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,800
Why look for a stolen van?

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,600
Talk to the locals,
maybe they saw something.

9
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,080
Not that anybody here
ever sees anything.

10
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,160
Hey, I grew up in this kind
of neighbourhood.

11
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,000
And how often did you help out
the cops?

12
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,360
Look.

13
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,160
Clear.

14
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,240
Nothing.

15
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,840
Looks like you been here a while.

16
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,200
Yeah. It's my thinking place.

17
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,720
See anyone leave that van
while you were thinking?

18
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,240
Maybe her?

19
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,920
Your approach sucks.

20
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,720
You never heard
of positive reinforcement?

21
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,520
You know, the reward system?

22
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,600
What are you doing?

23
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,200
What are you doing?

24
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,040
Is that positive enough for you,
or do you want me to reinforce you?

25
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,400
Okay, okay.

26
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,440
Up there, the light. The light.

27
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,920
All right?

28
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,760
Shit.

29
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,160
Shit.

30
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,120
Shit!

31
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,600
Wait.

32
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,240
Government agents!
Get your hands up!

33
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,520
Get up with your hands raised...

34
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,400
...or I'll blow your brains
all over the wall.

35
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,960
Get up!

36
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,040
Get up! And stop fucking laughing.

37
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,400
<i>Put your dick down
and pick up the phone. You there?</i>

38
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,720
<i>Don't forget about dinner.
Gina's having London broil.</i>

39
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,160
<i>If you put ketchup on it,
she'll kill you, then me.</i>

40
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,000
<i>Don't let me down, partner.</i>

41
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,000
<i>See you, buddy.</i>

42
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,720
<i>Informing upon your enemy
makes them your friend.</i>

43
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,840
<i>That which we cannot speak about,
we must pass over in silence.</i>

44
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,640
Section chief, please.

45
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,240
<i>The open hand cannot grasp discipline.</i>

46
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,920
Section chief, please.
Steven Grant is present.

47
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,800
<i>Fine. Steven Grant has
clearance. I'll be down.</i>

48
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,240
Thank you.

49
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,280
<i>The open hand cannot grasp discipline.</i>

50
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,200
The Capitol saw your report.

51
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,040
- Yeah. I was expecting this.
- No.

52
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,840
You weren't expecting this.

53
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,400
<i>Informing on your enemy
makes them your friend.</i>

54
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,320
Comrade.

55
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,080
<i>Privacy is illusion.</i>

56
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,080
<i>Two steps forward...</i>

57
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,320
<i>...half a step back.</i>

58
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,320
Mr. Grant, Arthur Kellman, director
of the National Security Agency.

59
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,680
Mr. Grant, meet John Seward,
deputy chief of Central Security.

60
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,320
Good to see you healthy.

61
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,400
- And officer Aaron Gray.
- Pleasure to meet you.

62
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,120
- We read the report.
- I know it's unreal.

63
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,520
We believe you.

64
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,120
Maybe we should
show him the videotape.

65
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,120
- That's why we believe you.
- You caught him!

66
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,920
Not him.
That's not the man you fought.

67
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,760
It has to be. How many
have teeth like that?

68
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,720
Roughly 4000, worldwide,
as far as we can discover.

69
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,880
You're shitting me big time.

70
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,720
Now, gentlemen, please follow me.

71
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,360
It's a genetic offshoot of humanity.
An evolutionary mutation.

72
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,400
Their lifespan is measured
in hundreds of years.

73
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,480
They're incredibly strong. Any
nonfatal wound heals in seconds.

74
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,120
- And they need blood to survive.
- Dr. Bathory.

75
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,880
The victim: female, Caucasian,
22 years old...

76
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,560
...found hanging with bound hands
and feet and clothes ripped.

77
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,720
Symmetrical lacerations
across the neck...

78
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,120
...severing the carotid artery
and the jugular veins.

79
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,960
The tissue is frayed as if torn...

80
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,680
...not sheared, as you'd expect
with a knife or blade.

81
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,360
The x-rays show crush fractures
of the carpals.

82
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,440
Anything else, doctor?

83
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,480
There are six victims
with one thing in common:

84
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,080
Perforations of the esophagus,
with multiple lacerations.

85
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,680
In plain English, their throats were
ripped out and their blood drained.

86
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,360
Their reflexes, movements
are so much faster than ours.

87
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,680
They exist in an uncanny world,
a parallel universe.

88
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,080
They can blend in like an ordinary
human, unless they choose not to.

89
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,440
Vampires?

90
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,160
They're a cell mutation of the human
species, a different kind of breed.

91
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,080
- And there are 4000 of these things?
- Yeah.

92
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,120
- How do we get rid of them?
- We don't. They're not hostile.

93
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,000
They revealed themselves to us
last year.

94
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,040
"Not hostile."

95
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,800
The one that killed my partner
was pretty damn hostile!

96
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,360
He was a renegade. A deviant.

97
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,920
There's vampires who ain't deviant?

98
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,480
Their desires are no different
than most people's.

99
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,440
- Safety, security...
- Blood.

100
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,720
We don't feed on human blood.
We've developed a synthetic substitute.

101
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,440
We? We?

102
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,760
Promise me you just didn't
fucking say 'we.'

103
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,680
What makes you such a goddamn expert?

104
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,080
You haven't told him.

105
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,720
- Hold it, Grant.
- Aaron, would you step outside?

106
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,560
We were hoping you'd work with him.

107
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,600
They're immune to virtually all
disease, and that's only a start.

108
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,720
The potential benefits of integrating
with them are incalculable.

109
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,280
Don't think we've done
this casually.

110
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,800
We've taken all necessary precautions
in controlling their population.

111
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,320
- What precautions?
- That's classified.

112
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,680
But that is until we see your
willingness to fit into this project.

113
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,400
I've got to fit in with them?

114
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,320
If a Puerto Rican had killed your
partner, you'd exterminate them all?

115
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,880
Puerto Ricans don't bench-press
trucks! Or drink blood.

116
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,360
Neither do they.
They've evolved.

117
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,960
Increasing their population by turning
humans into vampires is suicide.

118
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,800
I don't think you want
someone else to find Phil's killer.

119
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,760
Aaron is the best man
in their police force.

120
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,360
He wants this killer
as badly as you do.

121
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,360
You must get that a lot.

122
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,160
Sometimes.

123
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,360
- This must have come as quite a shock.
- Do me a favour.

124
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,960
Don't try to be my pal.
Let's just go to work.

125
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,800
Phil got bit in the neck.

126
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,800
There's no way he'll become
one of you, is there?

127
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,600
For one to be transformed,
there must be an exchange of blood.

128
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,160
Even when that happens, 20% of the
population is naturally immune.

129
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,240
Don't worry, unintentional infection
is minimal.

130
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,600
You actually fought him,
and you're still alive.

131
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,160
I am impressed.

132
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,240
Well, you just made my day.

133
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,080
Did anything strike you as unusual,
aside from the obvious?

134
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,360
Actually, yeah.

135
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,920
He's killed six others.
No eyewitnesses, nothing.

136
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,880
This time there's an eyewitness.

137
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,080
He parked his van in plain sight.

138
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,120
Could be he got careless...

139
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,080
...or wanted to get caught.

140
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,880
Not necessarily caught, but seen.

141
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,360
This is a critical time for us.

142
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,160
We've just revealed our existence
to you.

143
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,240
It's a decision
not all of us supported.

144
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,200
Someone may not want an alliance
with humanity to succeed.

145
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,040
And that someone...

146
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,360
...has still got a taste
for the real thing.

147
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,680
It's broad fucking daylight.

148
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,680
Aren't you supposed to be
bursting into flames?

149
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,880
That only happens in movies.

150
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,440
We prefer night. The sun's a minor
irritant. That's why I wear glasses.

151
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,200
Well, I do like the shades.

152
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,800
- You wanted to go over your notes.
- Yes. They're at headquarters.

153
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,920
Where's that? Transylvania?

154
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,960
You should be
in the movies, Mr. Grant.

155
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,600
"Serenity"? You've gotta be kidding.

156
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,840
Definitely worth the trip.

157
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,280
Hungry, Mr. Grant?

158
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,440
I bet they make
a great blood sausage.

159
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,040
<i>...a sixth consecutive
murder victim...</i>

160
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,240
<i>...killed in the same horrifying
manner as the rest.</i>

161
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,920
<i>Throat brutally cut...</i>

162
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,480
<i>...and all blood drained
from the body.</i>

163
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,000
<i>Police continue to say they have
promising leads...</i>

164
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,680
<i>...but public outcry is growing
with each new killing.</i>

165
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,280
<i>This is Arthuria Homer...</i>

166
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,480
<i>...with a special news bulletin.</i>

167
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,720
My son!

168
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,720
Get your hands off my son!

169
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,880
Back off fucker!

170
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,280
You are scaring my son!

171
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,680
You shouldn't bring him here.

172
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,280
- Go. Go!
- Get him out of here.

173
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,560
It's all right.

174
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,600
- It's all right.
- Get out!

175
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,120
The boy is fine.

176
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,440
Are you satisfied?

177
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,760
Look, man, I thought the kid...

178
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,400
I know exactly what you thought.

179
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,440
What were you thinking
bringing me here?

180
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,120
They don't need some racist cop
throwing his weight around.

181
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,080
Racist? You calling me a racist?

182
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,440
You. Humanity.

183
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,720
"Made in God's image."

184
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,320
You're all so arrogant.

185
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,840
Let's just go to work.

186
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,640
Who's this?

187
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,280
One of many suspects. Excuse me,
everything is in specific order.

188
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,800
Look, man, if we're gonna
be working together...

189
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,880
...we have to be straight up
with each other.

190
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,880
Is that right?

191
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,560
Some plants would
brighten up the place.

192
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,720
I didn't know you were a comedian,
Mr. Grant.

193
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,520
The handcuffs are silver.
The bullets, silver-jacketed.

194
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,400
Isn't that expensive?

195
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,000
We're allergic to silver. The wounds
won't heal until the bullet's removed.

196
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,720
What the fuck is this?

197
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,520
Prison cells.

198
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,320
Made of plastic compound.

199
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,840
They can withstand high explosives.

200
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,400
Bars are too easy to bend.

201
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,800
No guests?

202
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,520
These are set aside for violent
criminals. Murderers.

203
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,360
No stake through the heart?

204
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,480
This is not the movies.
And up until now...

205
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,040
...we have had no use for either.

206
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,960
We are a very peaceful people.

207
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,280
- I've looked forward to meeting you.
- Who are you?

208
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,200
The name is Cross.

209
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,640
Dr. Cross.

210
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,880
I founded this town.

211
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,640
Let's compare notes, shall we?

212
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,160
I reviewed the autopsy
on the latest victim.

213
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
No forensic evidence.

214
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,840
- Her throat was cut with a knife.
- My partner's wasn't.

215
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,840
We couldn't get a dental imprint.
He was careful not to bite them.

216
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,040
He just used his fangs.

217
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,960
The effect was the same
as if he had used forceps.

218
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,440
It's possible that the
killings are politically motivated.

219
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,800
Almost certainly.

220
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,160
This is not the work of a man
who is in a grip of blood lust.

221
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,400
Our synthetic substitute
stamped out that behaviour...

222
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,840
...years ago.

223
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,640
No. The being who perpetrated
these horrible crimes...

224
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,800
...is deliberately defying
our community.

225
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,320
Making a statement.

226
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,880
You must understand, Agent Grant,
our people are afraid.

227
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,800
We are an easy target
for human paranoia here.

228
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,240
It's what you wanted.

229
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,200
I advocated coming forward.
I said we'd be safe.

230
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,680
Help us find the rogue
before it's too late...

231
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,760
...and my people are punished
unfairly.

232
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,040
This disk...

233
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,560
...contains a database...

234
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,800
...of all known vampires worldwide.

235
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,080
Sir, I can handle that.

236
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,880
I'll be in the car.

237
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,600
- You can't give them names.
- We have to trust each other.

238
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,560
With our lives.

239
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,440
<i>Privacy is illusion.
Trust authority.</i>

240
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,680
Cross has made overtures
for months about this information.

241
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,360
How did you persuade him?

242
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,800
- He just gave it to me.
- But why?

243
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,880
God knows. Maybe he really wants
what's best for his people.

244
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,760
The bad news is, I don't have faith
in them like he does.

245
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,080
We spoke of precautions.

246
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,000
After the work you put in,
you deserve a look.

247
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,600
<i>Existence proceeds essence.</i>

248
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,440
<i>Nothing is true.
Everything is permitted.</i>

249
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,960
Fleming.

250
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,200
Damn it!

251
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,400
Dr. Fleming, Agent Grant.
Grant is our field man.

252
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,760
Show him why we aren't worried
about tracking them.

253
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,680
Here's a sample of their blood...

254
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,400
...infected with a deadly
airborne virus we have created...

255
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,160
Highly contagious.

256
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,200
What will it do to humans?

257
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,840
Very little.

258
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,960
The lab tests are done, and volunteers
have started the human trials.

259
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,680
The human effect is only mild
flu-like symptoms.

260
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,640
That's as bad as it should get.
The vampire effect...

261
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,600
...is rather like...

262
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,280
...the Ebola virus.

263
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,840
<i>Agent Grant, report to 71st Street.
The Freudian Building.</i>

264
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,280
Right. Her name's Barbara Steel.

265
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,760
Died around 4:30 a. m.
Sophomore at the university.

266
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,240
Christ! Kellman's daughter
goes there.

267
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,760
Apartment's owned by Graf Orlock,
psychiatrist. He saw patients there.

268
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,640
- Anybody locate him yet?
- Nope.

269
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,080
We put out an APB,
but nobody's seen him in 3 days.

270
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,160
Anybody see her come in?
Doorman? Security camera?

271
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,240
No. That's what I don't get.

272
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,400
There's security cameras everywhere.
In the lobby, on the roof.

273
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,720
We reviewed the tapes, but nothing.

274
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,120
One of Orlock's patients?

275
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,400
No idea. His appointment book
is missing.

276
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,120
Sewage.

277
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,920
Is there a way to the sewers?

278
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,360
There's a drain down in the basement,
I think.

279
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,000
The superintendent,
he can tell you more.

280
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,560
But I tell you:

281
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,480
If the killer got in that way, he
must be some kind of Olympic acrobat.

282
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,040
So, is this Orlock one of you?

283
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,960
Yes.

284
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,960
When were you gonna tell me?

285
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,880
- Orlock didn't kill that poor girl.
- Why not?

286
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,080
He's one of Cross strongest
supporters. He has no motive.

287
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,040
Something you'll learn...

288
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,640
...sometimes being a sick fuck
is all the motive you need.

289
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,880
Hello?

290
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,840
Anybody home?

291
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,120
There's a book in the fire!

292
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,600
Aaron, where the fuck are you?

293
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,080
Shit! Shit! Aaron!

294
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,920
Get the book!

295
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,920
Fuck.

296
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,160
Come on, let's take this asshole!

297
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,960
- He's gone.
- All that was for nothing?

298
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,680
Not quite nothing.

299
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,440
It was him. The one who killed Phil.

300
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,960
Are you sure?

301
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,640
Your senses are heightened, right?
Did you recognize him?

302
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,640
- His smell? Anything?
- No.

303
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,000
The odour of burning flesh
overpowered everything else.

304
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,840
There are pages missing.
He was...

305
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,440
...ripping them out...

306
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,600
...and burning them individually...

307
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,600
...till he heard you coming
and threw the whole book in.

308
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,320
The leather protected it.
Most of the interior is intact.

309
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,680
Appointment next week.
"Albert P. 52." Who's Albert P.?

310
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,880
- He wasn't planning on disappearing.
- No. Exactly the opposite.

311
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,320
- Any meetings today?
- Lucy Westenra.

312
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,760
Somebody you know?

313
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,400
Thanks.

314
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,920
For what?

315
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,880
For saving my life.

316
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,880
Just doing my job.

317
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,560
If somebody saves your life,
don't act like it's nothing.

318
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,200
Wouldn't be human.
You're supposed to say something.

319
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,280
- Supposed to give him his props.
- Props?

320
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,240
- What is "props"?
- Proper respect.

321
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,440
R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

322
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,960
Ah, respect.

323
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,720
That's a big-ass house.

324
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,000
What is "big-ass"?

325
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,280
Excuse me.
It's time for his medicine.

326
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,920
What, the fucking cat's a vampire?

327
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,880
They're born killers, Lucy.

328
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,720
If you provoke them, they'll
act on their natural instincts.

329
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,560
I doubt your friend
finds that attitude reassuring.

330
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,960
You could say the same about us.

331
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,280
You're Steven Grant, aren't you?

332
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,360
The man who's going to save us
from ourselves.

333
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,760
Your name was in Orlock's book.

334
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,800
He's my therapist. I have a session.

335
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,360
When is the last time
you spoke to him?

336
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,400
When I made the appointment.

337
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,640
What do you know about
the dead girl in his apartment?

338
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,160
I didn't know there was one.

339
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,200
You don't sound surprised.

340
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,840
I didn't think this was a social call.

341
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,600
You think Orlock is your rogue?
Ridiculous. He has no motive.

342
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:36,360
I love the way everybody talks about
motive like it's a big mystery.

343
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,400
He got tired of decaf,
felt like sucking real blood.

344
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,480
Maybe he invited you
for a taste of the real thing.

345
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,560
I don't suck human blood,
Detective Grant.

346
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,840
And if I did, would I rob
some little college girl of hers?

347
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,920
No.

348
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,040
I'd hunt for some real red meat.

349
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,880
You have an alibi for 4:30 a. m.?

350
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,080
I was at an after-hours club.

351
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,920
That proves jack shit.

352
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,960
Since when must I prove anything
to you, detective?

353
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,840
Anyway, ask the owner.

354
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,240
His name is Boudreaux.

355
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,840
I was there from 2 until 6.

356
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,360
Here's the phone number.

357
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,360
So this came from that address?

358
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,680
Where'd you get this?

359
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,360
Orlock's apartment.

360
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,920
Interesting.

361
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,600
What is Orlock's connection
with Boudreaux?

362
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,920
It has to do with Orlock's habits.

363
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,200
He doesn't like to limit himself.

364
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,800
He's at the top of
my list of suspects.

365
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,960
So what's keeping us?

366
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,600
Miss, if you'd accompany us...

367
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,280
...you might be of assistance
in questioning Boudreaux.

368
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,800
Let me change my clothes.

369
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,280
She knows something.

370
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,080
She knows many things not
necessarily connected to our case.

371
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,520
She's trying to play me.

372
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,800
She's always like that.
There's no point in bringing her.

373
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,320
She's hiding something,
which means she's coming.

374
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,280
Which means we'll be here awhile.

375
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,080
- Allow me.
- Thank you.

376
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,960
- I'll do the talking.
- Anyone tell you your approach sucks?

377
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,480
I guess we're in.

378
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,760
Now, take us to Boudreaux.

379
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,480
Ready for the nightlife, Mr. Grant?

380
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,200
Be gone! You tamper with forces
far beyond your comprehension.

381
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,880
He didn't just say that.

382
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,120
Quit the Anne Rice routine.
We're not amused.

383
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,560
What can I say,
I got a great life.

384
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,120
The costume, the accent,
gets me all the ass I can handle.

385
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:15,200
If this is about sex and drugs,
I got no control over my clientele.

386
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,960
This time it's not about drugs,
my friend.

387
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,560
And it's not about sex.
It's about Graf Orlock.

388
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,280
He's missing.

389
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,400
Well, Orlock and I,
we have common interests.

390
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,080
We're not close. If he's not home,
I don't know what to say.

391
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,720
Boudreaux, you know better
than to lie to me.

392
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,560
Since you know him so well,
you can tell me...

393
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,800
...about the connection between him
and the murders.

394
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,920
Orlock's a pussy, not a killer.

395
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,560
That's what I told you.

396
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,640
What's a killer doing
hiding in his basement?

397
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,280
- West.
- Hello, Aaron.

398
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,400
Keep an eye on him.

399
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:04,680
His rap sheet was on your desk.
Feel like telling me who he is?

400
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,880
Keeping secrets from your partner,
Aaron?

401
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,160
Where's the trust?

402
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,760
His name is West.

403
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,040
He's leader of the opposition
to Cross.

404
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,160
He believes exposing ourselves
to humans is suicidal.

405
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,320
Not "believes."

406
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,480
Knows. I've seen witch hunts.

407
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,440
Slavery...

408
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,760
...the massacre of millions of Jews,
Aaron.

409
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,680
I realize that war between us
is inevitable.

410
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,120
- Boudreaux?
- Orlock!

411
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,800
- Oh, crap.
- Jesus!

412
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,480
He's mine. Cover West.

413
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,560
Come and get me, human.

414
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,360
- Orlock?
- Ah, shit!

415
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,240
- Freeze, fucker!
- Come and get me.

416
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,240
Stop laughing!

417
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,800
Fuck you!

418
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,080
You're all so pathetic. Humans!

419
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,880
Come and get me.

420
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,200
- Allow me.
- Let go! I'm too heavy!

421
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,560
Is everyone all right?

422
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,080
Everyone's fine.

423
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,160
Except West, he's dead.

424
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,800
Is he?

425
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,320
Yeah.

426
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,680
What the...?!

427
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,920
Going somewhere?

428
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,440
Damn it!

429
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,640
You'll be happy to know West got away,
though he won't get far.

430
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,640
But Orlock's dead. So...

431
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,800
- Tell us what we want to know.
- What were they doing here?

432
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,640
Go to hell.

433
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,320
Wrong answer?

434
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,600
- I thrive on pain.
- Well...

435
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,080
Steven, no.

436
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,920
Not feeling talkative, huh?
You still got one left.

437
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,200
No, wait! Wait! Wait!

438
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,440
Wait!

439
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,760
Orlock called, asked me to set up
a meeting with West.

440
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,240
- Why?
- I don't know. West didn't either.

441
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,920
Orlock was scared.
I've never heard him like that.

442
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,640
What was West planning?

443
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,760
Some big operation. A big deal.

444
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,480
He said he'd fill me in on it today.

445
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,120
Now none of us gets to find out.

446
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,640
Let me explain the concept
of "partners."

447
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,880
Why don't you?

448
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,640
Partners work together as a team.

449
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,040
They don't hold back information.

450
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,840
This West is a militant
revolutionary...

451
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,200
...who thinks that humans
are the great Satan.

452
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,240
And you decide
he's not worth mentioning.

453
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,880
He's been underground a long time.
It's strange he's here.

454
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,160
Great.

455
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,960
Any other leading citizens
you forgot to mention?

456
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,440
That's enough.

457
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,480
- Maybe a Hitler type...
- That's enough.

458
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,000
...who'd like to put us all in camps?

459
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,560
That's enough.

460
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
What?

461
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,360
I thought you might like to come in...

462
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,560
...to talk about the case.

463
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,320
Are you serious?

464
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,880
So let's talk about the case.

465
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,880
Is that why you're here?

466
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,560
If I knew,
I probably wouldn't be here.

467
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:12,040
I'm moved that you care at all
what I think.

468
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:21,240
Yeah, well, I should probably have
my head examined.

469
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,880
You are a top homicide detective.

470
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,320
The weight of the world
is on your shoulders.

471
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,400
We know from the way
you relate to women...

472
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,040
...you want to be a hero to them.
A protector.

473
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,280
But they scare you.
At some level, you hate them.

474
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,080
I'm going to say...

475
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,480
...abusive mother.
A younger sister you protected.

476
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,160
Am I right?

477
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,640
I'm sorry.

478
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,360
I don't know when to...

479
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,480
So you figured me out.

480
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,400
I guess we're done here.

481
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:20,640
Absolutely. All you have to do
is get by the cat.

482
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,600
Shit...

483
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,000
Any other way out of here?

484
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,240
I'm afraid not.

485
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,240
Locked in a house with a vampire.

486
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,080
I used to have nightmares like this
when I was a kid.

487
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,400
- Whiskey.
- Yes, sir.

488
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,800
I never did like the taste.

489
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,680
I owe you an apology.

490
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,760
The Hitler line.

491
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,920
No. We've all done things...

492
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,720
...we later regret.

493
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,720
I lost my family to the Nazis.

494
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,280
- You're Jewish?
- Yes. Polish.

495
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,360
Gray is an Anglicized name.

496
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,360
That was a long time ago...

497
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,040
...when the Nazis
took everything we had.

498
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,840
And I decided...

499
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,720
...my family would not be led
like sheep to be slaughtered.

500
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,920
So we fled...

501
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,960
...through the sewers...

502
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,040
...and into the forests.

503
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:47,160
But this was the middle of winter.

504
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,360
We escaped the soldiers...

505
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,800
...but not the cold.

506
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,280
When he found us...

507
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,760
...my wife and daughter were dead.

508
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,400
And I was close to following them.

509
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:16,480
He gave me life
and a reason to exist.

510
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,160
You want to die with your child...

511
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,160
...with your wife?

512
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:51,040
Or live, and take revenge?

513
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,560
I found them in a bar...

514
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,760
...drinking.

515
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,840
My daughter's body
was frozen to the ground.

516
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,400
And they were singing.

517
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,560
A Jew!

518
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,360
What do you want? You piece of shit!

519
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,440
You Jewish piece of shit!

520
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,280
Sounds like they got
what they deserved.

521
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:02,760
Everybody's got that rage
inside of them. Everybody.

522
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,280
It started as revenge...

523
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,840
...but then when
I tasted human blood...

524
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,040
...everything else was forgotten.

525
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,760
The blood lust took control.

526
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,840
And it was that moment...

527
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,200
...that I realized what was inside me.

528
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,720
What I'd become.

529
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,600
What's it like?

530
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,600
What?

531
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:42,080
Biting into flesh and finding blood.
Is it like getting high?

532
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,200
It's a place you never want to visit.

533
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:57,000
Come on. Let's go to work.

534
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:02,080
Graf Orlock
is one of Cross' lieutenants.

535
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,720
The other is Dean Fusco.

536
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,640
We have to find him.

537
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,040
What, here?

538
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,920
He has an attachment
to his family life.

539
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,640
This is the family crypt.
His mother's in there.

540
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,080
You know Italians and their mothers.

541
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,200
- He's been here recently.
- How do you know?

542
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,120
I can smell him.

543
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,720
Some of us gotta get by
on police work alone, pal.

544
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,920
- Have you noticed anything strange?
- Besides the obvious?

545
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:35,160
Every time we need a lead,
someone is willing to supply it.

546
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,400
The killer waits for you and
your partner to see his crime.

547
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:43,040
Then again at Orlock's,
tossing the book into the fire...

548
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,240
...knowing I'll be able to save it.

549
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,160
Why is he making it obvious
he's one of us?

550
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,840
Do you think we're
being led by the nose?

551
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,360
Are you saying this case
is too easy?

552
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:57,440
If the killer is smart enough to
use you, me and everyone else...

553
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,000
...it's far from easy.

554
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,440
I can't believe he doesn't fillet you.

555
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,960
He trusts me. I'm not sure
I can say the same for you.

556
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,800
You still flinch when I touch you.

557
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:18,800
And you're brooding about something
but you won't tell me what.

558
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,760
- Sorry. It's hard to get used to.
- What I am?

559
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,240
Trusting someone.

560
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,640
As for what's on my mind,
it's this case.

561
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,920
We've hit a wall.
We're trying to find this guy.

562
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,800
Dean Fusco.

563
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,520
Dean was turned in 1941.

564
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,160
He was always kind of stuck there.
The way he dressed and talked.

565
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,840
He always wanted to be a movie star,
but never made it.

566
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,440
Aaron said he was attached
to his human side.

567
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:55,240
Always visiting his mother's grave,
his old neighbourhood, his sister.

568
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:00,400
In disguise, watching the
people he knew grow old and die.

569
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,560
He was a very lonely man.

570
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,040
Son of a bitch!

571
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,800
His sister. Different last name.

572
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,200
Do you know her married name?

573
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,720
Yeah.

574
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:14,840
Solerno, Mary. She lives upstate.

575
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,760
If you found this rogue,
this killer...

576
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,520
...would it really make a difference?

577
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,280
Would it convince your leaders
to accept us?

578
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,560
If it doesn't, I will.

579
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,560
Fusco's sister owns a theatre
in the town they grew up in.

580
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,600
Lucy said she lives upstate.

581
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,120
We can check it out on the way.

582
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,640
Do you think this is a good idea?

583
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,000
Oh, come on, man!

584
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,000
I'm only human.

585
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,520
You go in and I'll circle around.

586
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,320
Are you kidding? He's a vampire.
No offense.

587
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,160
Okay, but he'll smell whoever
goes in first.

588
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:10,800
- If it's me, he may run.
- So?

589
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,200
Hopefully, he'll think
you're a homeless person.

590
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,880
Hopefully.

591
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,440
Hopefully.

592
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,360
Grim-visag'd war
hath smooth'd his wrinkled front.

593
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:29,360
See, see, where Christ's blood
streams in the firmament!

594
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
One drop would save me.

595
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,880
I must always walk alone.

596
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:40,480
And yet always I am followed.

597
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:45,080
Sound asleep and yet...
And yet I can hear it!

598
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,000
It's me! Pursuing myself.

599
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,560
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm a cop.

600
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,920
We had reports of a
break-in. Who are you?

601
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:03,960
Oh? I? Oh, my dear boy,
I am an actor.

602
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,560
I can be anyone I wish to be.

603
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,760
Well, you got any I.D.?
A driver's license?

604
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,720
Maybe an Academy Award?

605
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,600
I never leave home without it.

606
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,440
I know why you're here.

607
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:26,040
You're an errand boy sent by
shopkeepers to collect the bill.

608
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,720
I hear your heart beat faster
when you lie.

609
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,720
So, one more time.
Who the hell are you?

610
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,640
Take it easy.

611
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,320
Drop it!

612
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,320
Look what you're doing to my shirt!

613
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,600
Sit down! Sit down!

614
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,360
We can do this one of two ways.

615
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,160
- My way, or my way.
- Relax.

616
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,360
We want to know who you're
hiding from. Is it West?

617
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,600
West!

618
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,600
West is only part of it.
It goes much deeper than that.

619
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:09,160
You wouldn't believe
who's involved in this...!

620
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,320
Just start from the beginning.

621
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:16,240
You know, Aaron, not everybody
was wild about this...

622
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,680
...coming-out-of-the-closet routine.

623
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:22,360
Things were tense.
This made it worse.

624
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,600
You should have thought of that!

625
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,600
All right. All right.

626
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,640
Orlock heard West was back...

627
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,600
...and into something.

628
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,680
Smuggling? We didn't know.
We presumed weapons.

629
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,760
But West was still spouting
the same old revolutionary poop.

630
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:57,320
Would you just stick to the point?

631
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,040
We were supposed to find out more.

632
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,800
Orlock was supposed to tell Cross.

633
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I guess he never got the chance.

634
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,120
He phoned me. He was scared.

635
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,240
He wouldn't talk on the phone.

636
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,720
He said we were in danger.
He told me to leave town...

637
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,480
...and he'd contact me.

638
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,120
- He's dead.
- He never did!

639
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:23,240
Why would Orlock meet with
West if he was afraid?

640
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,480
Maybe he wanted to cut the deal.

641
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:30,720
Yes, it's true. Orlock wasn't
the toughest guy in the world.

642
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,800
Being on the run was hard on him.

643
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,120
- Something's missing.
- You dug into West's operation.

644
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,200
Did you find anything?

645
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,040
Something about a shipment
coming in on the 20th.

646
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,680
Tomorrow?

647
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,600
Weapons smuggling.

648
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,280
With the money involved,
West can't pull this off alone.

649
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:52,040
Then somebody else
had to be involved. Who?

650
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,440
Somebody I thought I knew.

651
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,800
Come on. Come on, man.

652
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:07,120
Lucy. Lucy Westenra.

653
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,320
You're lying.

654
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,680
I'd know if he was.

655
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,160
It's all right.

656
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,160
We don't know the whole story.
You said it yourself.

657
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,440
- When is this going down?
- I don't know.

658
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,240
I don't even know how.

659
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,120
- Planes, trucks...
- It makes perfect sense!

660
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,400
She sends me
on a wild goose chase upstate...

661
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,840
...so I'm not around
for the shipment.

662
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,520
She distracted me
so West could escape.

663
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,400
She also saved your life.

664
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,600
She used me.
Why are you defending her?

665
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,600
- I'm not.
- Damn it!

666
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,320
I can't believe
she's involved in this.

667
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,000
If you report this,
they'll assume the worst.

668
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:02,640
- Why shouldn't they?
- We're trying to prevent war. Please!

669
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,640
Not until we've had the chance
to check it out.

670
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:15,400
"Albert P." isn't a person.
It stands for Albert Pier.

671
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:18,440
- I came to the same conclusion.
- We'll check it out.

672
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,880
If it's more than we can handle,
I'm calling it in.

673
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,520
Fair enough.

674
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,600
Grant's here right now.
I'll get back to you.

675
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:36,800
That's your official recommendation?
Hold off?

676
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,280
What's that supposed to mean?

677
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,200
Just what it says.

678
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,600
This looks more complicated
than just plain murder.

679
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,840
It's political.
They're fighting among themselves.

680
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,040
We don't have time for
conspiracy theories.

681
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,200
I agree with Mr. Grant.

682
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,960
If this is manipulation,
I want to know.

683
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,200
I thought we agreed.

684
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,560
You've got to let me get
to the bottom of this.

685
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:06,720
If you brought me in because you
wanted a stooge, you made a mistake.

686
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:10,920
What is the rush, Seward?
The virus can reach them anywhere.

687
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,680
Same thing as before? I'll go in
the side and you circle around.

688
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,080
As you wish.

689
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,400
- This place stinks.
- That's good.

690
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,280
It'll cover your approach.

691
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,640
Agent Grant. Get me Kellman.

692
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,320
Don't move unless I say.

693
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:19,840
<i>Sewards SWAT team's a bunch
of trigger-happy fuckers.</i>

694
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,320
<i> - Where are you?
- Albert Pier, number 52.</i>

695
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:23,920
We'll be waiting.

696
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,680
Special forces are in position.

697
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:32,280
The ship will be here
in a few minutes.

698
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,120
Any questions?

699
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:40,320
I got a question for you.
How fucking stupid do you think I am?

700
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,520
Back off, fucker!

701
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,320
You don't understand.

702
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:47,120
I wanted to tell you.
I couldn't risk it.

703
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:50,520
I understand perfectly. You used me.

704
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,520
<i>Get Seward. Were moving in.</i>

705
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,280
<i>Where's Grant?</i>

706
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,000
Put the gun down.

707
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,360
I should have known
you were involved in this.

708
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:06,240
Don't be an idiot, Steven,
open your eyes.

709
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,680
Look! Fusco misled us.

710
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,320
It's not weapons.
People are being smuggled out.

711
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,800
Can't you see? My people are afraid.

712
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,040
Weapons? Is that what you thought?

713
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,640
You wouldn't let me tell him.
Look what almost happened.

714
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,040
Seward, you motherfucker!

715
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,800
I didn't give the word!

716
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,200
You betrayed us!

717
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,600
Traitor!

718
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,640
I've been waiting for this...

719
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,920
- ... for centuries.
- Tell them to cease fire!

720
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,760
Get off!

721
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,240
Mama!

722
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:46,720
Save the kid!

723
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:50,200
Take him!
I'm going after his parents.

724
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,600
Move, move, move!

725
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:29,400
Hold your fire!

726
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,440
No, you're wounded.

727
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,040
It's nothing.

728
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,880
- No, my blood.
- I don't care!

729
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:20,720
What's going on?

730
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,840
- How is she?
- Stable.

731
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,840
The transfusion from Aaron helped.

732
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,200
She's not getting any worse.

733
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,960
But she isn't getting any better?

734
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:43,160
She's in a coma. But understand...

735
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:46,520
...our physiology is different
from yours.

736
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,240
The body goes
into a coma-like state...

737
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,800
...when it's severely damaged...

738
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,640
...as it attempts to heal itself.

739
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,400
She will fully recover.

740
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,800
What are her chances?

741
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:04,960
Twenty-five percent.

742
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,560
I have to get back to Serenity.

743
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:12,240
Half of my people are going
into hiding...

744
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:16,320
...the other half are arming
themselves.

745
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:21,440
It will take a lot of work
to clean up the mess you've made.

746
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:23,280
Is that her blood?

747
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:28,040
My God.

748
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,600
You could be infected.

749
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:33,320
You should check in here yourself.

750
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,320
And if I'm infected?

751
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
You'll transform...

752
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:43,120
...within three days.

753
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,600
Is there any way to stop it?

754
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,040
No.

755
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:50,240
What's the point of checking in?

756
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:59,600
There has to be some mistake.
You couldn't have shot my men!

757
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:01,720
Tell me I'm wrong, go ahead!

758
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,040
Tell me, goddamn it!

759
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:08,560
Your men weren't even scratched.
I shot at their body armour.

760
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,440
The only reason I didn't shoot them
in the head...

761
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,560
...was because it was
on your order.

762
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:17,840
I had to use my judgment.
You were in there a long time.

763
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,240
I was in there five minutes!

764
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:30,040
<i>Informing on your enemy
makes them your friend.</i>

765
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,880
I called you to tell you
you're going back to your old job.

766
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,560
The official story is
you're on medical leave.

767
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,080
Seward wanted to fire you, I said no.
He's too busy to fight, so...

768
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,640
Busy with what?

769
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:50,040
The situation's becoming untenable.

770
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:53,400
- We're releasing the virus.
- Not yet.

771
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,520
I'm close, damn it!

772
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:59,720
Last night another girl
disappeared from the university.

773
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,600
She is my daughter.

774
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:07,320
<i>We cant stop anyone from leaving.</i>

775
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:10,360
<i>Be sure they have enough
blood substitute to last.</i>

776
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:11,800
<i>We are at the lab.</i>

777
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,520
Good.

778
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:17,760
It's Steven Grant.

779
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,600
Tell him I'm busy.

780
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,840
He says it's urgent.

781
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:38,120
They're mixing up a big supply
of the virus...

782
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,120
...all over the world.

783
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,760
And I should trust you?

784
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:49,160
I screwed up. I know.

785
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,840
But you have to trust me.

786
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:54,320
Right now...

787
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:57,560
...your entire race is living
on borrowed time.

788
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,640
Why should I believe
this fantastic story?

789
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,840
Your senses are heightened.

790
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,560
You tell me if I'm lying.

791
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:24,320
We must do something.
Our people will all die.

792
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:28,680
So Agent Grant is going to steal
a sample of the virus?

793
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:31,720
Where is he planning
to get it from?

794
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,680
From Fleming's laboratory?

795
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:39,560
Yes. That's the name he used.

796
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:43,040
You knew of this?

797
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:51,040
I gave you your life.

798
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,640
And now, I'll take it.

799
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,360
You know, I really ought to thank you.

800
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:27,400
You just make everything so easy.

801
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:30,000
The incident at the pier was a gift.

802
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:33,880
Not only did it give us a perfect
chance to release the virus...

803
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,280
...but it got the slime
so worked up...

804
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,840
...they believed everything
I told them.

805
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:41,280
Your gun.

806
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:45,000
Give me your gun, slowly.

807
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:53,280
Well, you were sabotaging the virus.

808
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,000
You go for your gun...

809
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,800
...there's a struggle.

810
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,560
Et cetera. Et cetera.

811
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,880
Et cetera. Not original...

812
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:04,800
...but it works.

813
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,560
So the virus is lethal to humans.

814
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:12,960
There's that community-college
education coming into play.

815
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:14,680
I'm quite proud of it.

816
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,000
You see...

817
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:18,760
...the initial infection
with vampires...

818
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:21,880
...is quite severe,
and in humans quite mild.

819
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,920
But after a week,
the vampires recover...

820
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,640
...and the humans...

821
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:28,440
...die.

822
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,640
You're human.
Do you have an antidote?

823
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,120
Oh, no. No, it doesn't apply.

824
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,080
By the time the virus
is being released...

825
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,760
...I won't be human anymore.

826
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,240
He's going to turn me tonight.

827
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,680
Who?

828
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,200
You're not James Bond...

829
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,480
...and I'm not Blofeld.

830
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:53,480
No more explanations,
and no last-minute escapes.

831
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:56,880
How about no bullets?

832
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:03,560
Say something about my education now,
you fuck!

833
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:12,360
I knew you'd come.

834
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,640
I knew I could rely on you.

835
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,320
I promised...

836
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:19,600
...you'd never know disease,
weakness...

837
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,120
...or pain again.

838
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:27,600
And I intend to keep that promise.

839
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,560
I bled him dry.

840
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,240
He is starving.

841
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:00,600
I'm surprised that he's
been able to keep...

842
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,120
...from trying to attack you
this long.

843
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,760
It's all right.

844
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:09,840
I've sent everyone home.

845
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,000
We have time.

846
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:14,440
You will be pleased to know...

847
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:17,560
...that you won't be implicated
in Fleming's death.

848
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,120
His body will never be found.

849
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,640
Granted...

850
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,400
...questions might be asked.

851
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:29,920
But by tomorrow, their minds
will be on other things.

852
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,600
You will be dead...

853
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,800
...and I'll have given them
their rogue.

854
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:37,600
I'll have killed him, of course...

855
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:42,440
...but it's too late to keep you
from becoming his last victim.

856
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:46,280
Pity. I like you.

857
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,080
You have qualities
that most people today lack.

858
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:52,920
Determination...

859
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,680
...loyalty to friends...

860
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:57,720
...and partners.

861
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:00,880
It was you.

862
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:02,520
You killed Phil.

863
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:04,520
I took no pleasure in it.

864
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:09,280
Playing a murderer has been
extremely distasteful to me.

865
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:13,600
- I'm not a violent man by nature.
- Yeah, right.

866
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:17,560
All this talk
about peaceful coexistence...

867
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,520
...and all along...

868
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:22,320
...you're planning on
wiping out humanity.

869
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,400
Don't be ridiculous.

870
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,160
Civilization would collapse.

871
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,440
That's not what I want at all.

872
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:32,040
I already have a cure.

873
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,760
It's made from our blood.

874
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:38,440
And I plan to share it with humanity.

875
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:41,880
It will make people resistant
to the virus...

876
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:43,760
...to all disease.

877
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:46,680
One race.

878
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:48,920
I saw with my own eyes...

879
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:53,200
...what happened to the Indians,
the Africans, the Jews.

880
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,520
The only difference was race.

881
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:57,840
We can't fight you...

882
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:02,760
...but we can't trust you either.

883
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,280
This is the only way.

884
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:58,680
No!

885
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,000
Incredible!

886
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:17,480
I don't think I've ever seen
willpower like this!

887
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:22,120
Too bad. It's utterly pointless!

888
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:33,840
Go!

889
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,080
Excellent choice.

890
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:19,160
These silver bullets
are overkill on you.

891
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:31,320
But you will leave
an expensive corpse.

892
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,720
That's enough of that.

893
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:53,640
Goodbye.

894
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:09,120
That hurt.

895
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:14,240
Not bad for a final act.

896
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,640
But not quite good enough.

897
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,520
Hang in there.
Hang in there, partner.

898
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:56,040
I think we won.

899
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:03,440
The catastrophe that almost befell
us could only have been created...

900
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:06,160
...by mutual cooperation
between our two people.

901
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:10,640
And mutual cooperation is the only way
it could have been stopped.

902
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:14,240
We owe Steven Grant and Aaron Gray
a debt...

903
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,000
...for showing us that...

904
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:20,440
...for good or evil,
we are no different.

905
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:24,920
And I owe them a more personal debt
for my daughter's life.

906
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:37,400
I'm sorry I missed it.

907
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,760
Are you all right? You seem strange.

908
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:55,600
I got tested yesterday.

909
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,680
I'm not infected with your blood.

910
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,040
I never will be.

911
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:07,200
I'm immune.

912
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,280
One of the 20 percent.

913
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,440
I can never be like you.

914
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,760
Forty years from now...

915
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:28,120
...you won't have changed.

916
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,920
I'll be old...

917
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,240
...or dead.

918
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:41,200
I wasn't gonna tell you
till you got back on your feet.

919
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,800
I didn't want to upset you.

920
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:48,520
Why did you think I'd be upset?

921
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:52,760
Because I'll lose you in 40 years...

922
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:55,840
...or am I losing you now?

923
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:02,320
I just thought...
I mean, when you heard...

924
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:15,560
Do I strike you
as the kind of woman who...

925
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:17,880
...who...

926
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,960
...who takes the easy way out?

927
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:23,880
No.

928
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:28,040
Then the question is...

929
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:32,080
...are you that kind of man?

930
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,200
You know it won't be easy.

931
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,400
Nothing good ever is.

932
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:14,120
What's up?

933
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:15,880
They want us downtown.

934
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,480
I'll see you soon.

935
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,480
I'll be waiting.

936
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:45,080
You drive, partner.

937
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,480
Let's go to work.

938
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:26,600
