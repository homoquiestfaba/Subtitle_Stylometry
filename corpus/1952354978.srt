1
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:18,000
- Good morning, Miss Perky.
- Watch out, Miss Perky.

2
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,320
You missed!

3
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
- I've been waiting and waiting.
- Sorry.

4
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
- Every time we do this, we get caught.
- We ain't gonna get caught this time.

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
- If my mom f'inds out--
- She won't.

6
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
- She always f'inds out.
- That's why I'm glad I don't got a mom.

7
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
All right. Don't look.

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
- Why not?
- 'Cause they're hardly wearing nothing.

9
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Come on, Billy Bob.
I never heard of one law...

10
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
says you can't watch two girls
reading magazines.

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Are you so, so excited about the party?

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
If Billy Bob pays any attention to me.

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I thought Billy Bob held your hand
at the picture show.

14
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I thought he was going to,
but he didn't.

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I think Preacher likes you.

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Really?

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Why do you think he gave you
that stuffed squirrel,Janice?

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Maybe he just wanted to get rid of it.

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Janice, what did l just say?

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Stuffed squirrel.
He likes me.

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
- We're gonna get caught.
- No, we won't.

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Hey, little brother.

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
- We didn't do nothing, Butch.
- You're in our f'ield, little brother.

24
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
- Since when is this your f'ield?
- Since we staked our claim.

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You wanna get through,
you gotta pay a toll.

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
- We ain't paying you nothing.
- You don't gotta pay...

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
but if you wanna pass...

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
you gotta eat the head.

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,150
- Don't do it, Preach.
- Shut up, Billy Bob.

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,800
That was great!

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What'd it taste like?

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That was good.
That was the greatest thing ever.

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You made Butch throw up.

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So what'd it taste like?

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It tasted like--
It tasted like f'ish!

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
How many times?

37
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Lionel, how many times?
Always with the shortcuts.

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
There are no shortcuts in life, Lionel.

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Lover, I'm talking to you, baby,
but I can see you're not listening.

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I assure you, my dove,
I hear every euphonious word...

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
every golden syllable.

42
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Excuse me, miss.

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Can we help you?

44
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I require more help than you gentlemen
could possible provide...

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
at your tender age.

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But could you help my husband get us
the heck out of here?

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Pumpkin, help has arrived.

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Good day, young gentlemen.

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Where in God's green Earth are we?

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm telling you, Preacher,
I didn't hold her hand.

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
- I heard her say you did.
- I didn't!

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You held her hand!
You held her hand!

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Preacher,just shut up.

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Hi, Mr. Dixon, Mr. Trump.

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We're hoping they took a look
at them crazy saucers out there...

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
because most experts agree
that they probably don't exist.

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We're getting a lot of reports
on them from all over the country.

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That's the news.
Let's get back to some more music.

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Preach, look at this. '''Stan 'The Man'
Musial continues to struggle...

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
as the Cardinals lose a heartbreaker
to the Brooklyn Dodgers.''

61
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Things keep on like this, we might
as well forget that trip to the Series.

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Stan'll pull through, Preach, and come
October, we'll be right there...

63
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,500
eating Red Hots
and watching the Birds take it all.

64
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You ever seen anything
like that, Preach?

65
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You ever seen anything like this?

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You really don't care what God says
when he looks down on you, do you?

67
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You can't go ripping up
other people's property.

68
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You boys...

69
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
don't be hiding back there
like a couple of criminals.

70
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You have something you wanna confess?

71
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Happy birthday, son.

72
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Thirteen.
Off'icially makes you a man.

73
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
- Thanks, Mr. Dixon.
- Thanks, Mr. Dix.

74
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
- Can you make mine cherry instead?
- You licked it, Preacher.

75
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Just barely.

76
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Oh, my gosh, my party!

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Banana-- it's just great.

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Come on, Preach!

79
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,850
Don't slam that--

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
All right. Billy Bob's coming out
to pitch for the Cardinals.

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Here he goes.
Jackie Robinson, and--

82
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Strike one!

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,600
- Right here, Preacher.
- Preacher's famous knuckler.

84
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
- Gets him!
- How about a high-rising fastball?

85
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Here we go, girls.
My special three-layer cake...

86
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and all the tutti-frutti you can eat.

87
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Cora Mae,Janice,
I know those ant bites are painful...

88
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
but you mustn't scratch.

89
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
- Yes, Ms. Murphy.
- I don't want it to get dirty.

90
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What's it matter? lt's gonna
get dirty sooner or later.

91
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I wanna keep it clean.
Is that all right with you?

92
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Here's Billy Bob throwing his famous
fastball to Preacher Star.

93
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,850
Preacher knocks it out of the county.

94
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,000
When do you suppose those boys
will outgrow this baseball foolishness?

95
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Boys, the Picken's County Flower Show
is less than one month off.

96
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'd hate to be in your place
if I have to go there empty-handed.

97
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
- Thanks a lot, Malcolm.
- There goes our clean ball.

98
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
- Go get it, Malcolm.
- Malcolm, wait.

99
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,900
Let the 5:00 pass.

100
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Madam, are you
the adult of the house?

101
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
- Why, yes.
- My, what lovely roses.

102
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Roses are so elegant and romantic.

103
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
- Don't you think?
- I do, yes.

104
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Madam, I am Miss LilyJane Bobbit--

105
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Miss Bobbit--
from Memphis, Tennessee.

106
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Country children.

107
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
My mother and I have taken rooms here.

108
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Would you be so kind
as to point out the house?

109
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It belongs to a Mrs. Sawyer.

110
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Why, that's it right there.

111
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,200
Thank you.

112
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Excuse me, miss.

113
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Being such a hot day and all...

114
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
wouldn't you like to rest a spell
and have some tutti-frutti?

115
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,300
Yes, by all means,join us.

116
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Very fattening, tutti-frutti.

117
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But may I see you kindly?

118
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,900
Come along, Mommy.

119
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
My mother has
a disorder of the tongue...

120
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
so it is necessary
that l speak for her.

121
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
She has made dresses
for the society of many cities...

122
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
including Memphis and Tallahassee.

123
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
No doubt you've noticed and admired...

124
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
the dress that I wear
before you this afternoon.

125
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Every stitch of it
was hand sewn by my mother.

126
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
She can copy any pattern
and just recently won...

127
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
a $25 prize
from the Ladies'HomeJournal.

128
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Please, advise your friends
and family.

129
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,200
Thank you.

130
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Hello.

131
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
May I help you?

132
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,560
Step lightly.

133
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
From the get-go,
I don't allow smoking...

134
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,050
drinking or swearing.

135
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
- Hey, Speedy Thorne.
- Hey, Elinore.

136
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I heard it was somebody
around here's birthday.

137
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's a bat.
Stan ''The Man'' Musial model.

138
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
That's right.

139
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
- Thanks, Speedy. It's perfect.
- You're welcome.

140
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Boys, it's summertime.
You coming back to work for me, or what?

141
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yeah, we are. Only four months,
one week and two days till the Series.

142
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I haven't given you permission
to go, son.

143
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That's something we'll discuss
based on your behavior...

144
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
for the next four months,
one week and two days.

145
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
- Come on up and have some cake, Speedy.
- All right.

146
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,850
Girls, boys, have some more
tutti-frutti. Cheer up, girls.

147
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Watch out, Reverend.

148
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Okay, I'll tell my wife.
Thank you.

149
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Son, don't give me that--
I hate that stufF.

150
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
- Mr. Trump.
- What?

151
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You want to inherit my farm,
you better start showing me...

152
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
a little aptitude for the farming
business, you hear me?

153
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Good morning, sir.

154
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I am Miss LilyJane Bobbit.

155
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Good morning, young lady.
I'm Pastor Daniel Williams.

156
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I notice you have a small tatter
on your front.

157
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
As the spiritual leader
of this community...

158
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
you really ought to be flawless
in dress as well as decorum.

159
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Well, I serve the Lord,
not high fashion.

160
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Here you are.

161
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
- Your little girl lend you her bike?
- My wife's, Mr. Trump.

162
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
- I hope so.
- Good morning.

163
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Much obliged, little lady.

164
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,720
Ma'am.

165
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Good morning.

166
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
May I hand you one of these flyers?

167
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,850
Thank you, ma'am.

168
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
- Morning, Mr. Trump.
- Rosalba.

169
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Hi, Mr. Trump.
Can we give you a hand with that?

170
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Take these grain bags and throw them
in the back of my pickup there.

171
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
- Never mind.
- No, you don't.

172
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,550
Six of these... right in there.
Thank you very much.

173
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
- She went this way, right?
- Yeah, I think so.

174
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,400
No, wait. She went this way.

175
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,900
Follow me, Janice.

176
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
There she is.

177
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Hey, look who's here.

178
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
l just hate it when handsome young men
follow me around the countryside.

179
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Young gentlemen...

180
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
would you happen to have an automotive
repair facility here in fair Meadow?

181
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
We got the best, mister.

182
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's Speedy himself
over at Speedy's Garage.

183
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
- He's a war hero.
- A war hero auto mechanic named Speedy?

184
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,600
By golly, that's someone
I would dearly love to meet.

185
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
- She went that way.
- In case you were wondering.

186
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
- Who went which way?
- Yeah, what are you talking about?

187
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Do we look like we just fell ofF
a turnip truck?

188
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
- What's that for?
- Under the present circumstances...

189
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I don't feel it's proper to have this
sitting in my bedroom any longer.

190
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And I really don't care if I ever lay
eyes on you again, Billy Bob Murphy.

191
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
- I'll go get it.
- No, leave it.

192
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,200
All right.

193
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
All right. Here we go.

194
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
So you're up four.

195
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,350
Let's shuffle them up good.

196
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You'll be seeing double
by the time we leave.

197
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
- May I join you?
- Ma'am.

198
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
-Jeb, make room for the lady.
- Why me?

199
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Get out of here.

200
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Stay close, Jeb.
Gambling scares me.

201
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Could you teach me how to play
that game? Dominoes?

202
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Why, sure.

203
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Well, Mr. Speedy...

204
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
what's the good word?

205
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I replaced the fan belt.

206
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But I think the real problem is
your battery's not holding a charge.

207
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Is that so?

208
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
If you want my advice, you should
get you a new one as soon as you can.

209
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You are the expert, Mr. Speedy,
so I shall take your advice.

210
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
- You want me to get on that?
- My brother is also a f'ine mechanic.

211
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
He gets very upset with me when I
take my automotive business elsewhere...

212
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
so because of family loyalty,
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to wait.

213
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
- You understand?
- You bet.

214
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,250
Yeah.

215
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Lovely young thing.

216
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Is this your beloved
or the other gentleman?

217
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You mind putting that down?

218
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Sports star, war hero...

219
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
f'irst-class, top-notch
automobile repairman.

220
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Mr. Speedy, you have lived
an exciting life.

221
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Baby doll, I think it's about time
we leave, don't you?

222
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
We're on our way, my dear.

223
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I assume it's okay if I draw a check
from my personal bank in Birmingham?

224
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I suppose that'd be all right.
That's $3 for the belt and labor.

225
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
- Bye-bye.
- Come and see us now, you hear?

226
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,720
Ma'am.

227
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
My goodness, Speedy.
You're quite busy.

228
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's all them old cars from
before the war breaking down.

229
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Bad for the owners,
but it's good for me.

230
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
l'm even thinking about expanding.

231
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You just let me know if there's
anything else I can do for you.

232
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Indeed I shall, my friend.

233
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Until we meet again.

234
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,720
Ma'am.

235
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
How you doing, honey?

236
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Fine, thank you.

237
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Who are they?

238
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I believe those are the Quinces
from Birmingham.

239
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,720
I see.

240
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,450
I told you the battery's bad.

241
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
- Are the boys still here?
- They done their jobs and gone.

242
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I paid them 50 cents apiece.

243
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That was awfully kind of you.

244
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
The thought of turning those two loose
on the city of St. Louis...

245
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I hate to think.

246
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I wouldn't worry.

247
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I don't reckon the Cards have much of
a chance with the way things are going.

248
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Seems the boys got a crush
on your new little neighbor.

249
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You caught that too, did you?

250
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I told them they're
going about it all wrong.

251
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I gave them some good advice
on how to woo women.

252
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,250
Well, l best get on home.

253
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You ever feel like staying?

254
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Twenty-f'ive cents an hour.

255
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Anytime you want.

256
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'll surely think about that.

257
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,450
Would you focus on this game?

258
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,900
For heaven's sake!

259
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Morning,Juliana.
How are you this morning?

260
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Elinore, I'm sure there's
a logical explanation for all this.

261
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I don't want an explanation, Speedy.

262
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I want my roses.

263
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Speedy Thorne,
what is that siren all about?

264
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Oh, Mildred, it's awful.
It's just simply awful.

265
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Elinore's roses--
her beautiful roses-- stolen!

266
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Oh, shoot.
Nobody stole them roses.

267
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Preacher and your Billy Bob brought them
over to young Bobbit this morning...

268
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,650
before they started my yard work.

269
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I hope that boy's got on
his running shoes.

270
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Look at me!

271
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
How dare you!

272
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,850
Come on! Come look at what you did!
How could you do that?

273
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Son?

274
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
No. You treat me like a baby.

275
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You act like a baby, I'll treat you
like one. Now come down.

276
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I ain't never coming down.
I swear it!

277
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Suit yourself.

278
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
That appears to be the only way
l'll get any peace around here.

279
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And you can forget that trip
to St. Louis.

280
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,450
Fine! Cardinals stink anyway.

281
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
My thoughts are castles

282
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,200
My friends are my dreams

283
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Please come down and eat.

284
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I don't want any supper.

285
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I'm gonna stay up here all night.

286
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,720
Son...

287
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
sometimes in the heat of the moment...

288
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,800
we say things that later
we realize we just did not mean.

289
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
That was very gracious of you and your
friend to bring those lovely roses.

290
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
- It wasn't nothing.
- I'm not sure your mama would agree.

291
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
The thing is...

292
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
my daddy gave her those rose bushes
before he went off to the war.

293
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
When he didn't come back,
she decided that every year...

294
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
she'd enter those roses
in a flower show.

295
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I reckon I ruined it
for her this year...

296
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
not to mention
my trip to the World Series.

297
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
From where I'm standing,
there's only one thing to be done.

298
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You must make moral restitution,
Billy Bob.

299
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I don't know what that means,
but if you think it'll help--

300
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
You have to do something right
to cancel out the wrong.

301
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
What's needed here is a symbol
of your grief and regret...

302
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
at this unfortunate incident.

303
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Yeah.

304
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Dang! I'd sure like to buy anything.
The stores are all closed.

305
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Perhaps if we both sleep on it...

306
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,350
we'll come up with
a proper solution by morning.

307
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I'll

308
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Be seeing you

309
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,500
In all the old familiar places

310
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
That this heart of mine

311
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,960
Embraces

312
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,800
All day through

313
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,500
In

314
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,150
- Mom?
- That small cafe

315
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Your daddy was the best dancer
in the whole county.

316
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I bet you got his dancing feet.

317
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
- I don't know, Ma.
- Let's see. Come on.

318
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
You put your right hand
at the base of a woman's spine.

319
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And your left hand just so.

320
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,720
Now...

321
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:20,000
just pretend you're leading
the woman through clouds.

322
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
That's right.
You have the idea.

323
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I'll f'i'nd you

324
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,900
In the morning sun

325
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,250
And when the night is new

326
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Son, I know how much going to that
World Series means to you.

327
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And I know it was something
your daddy wanted you to do...

328
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
so of course you can go.

329
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
But, darling, I want you
to listen to me.

330
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
There'll be plenty of time
for proper courting when you're older.

331
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
You're too young to be going so crazy
over one little girl.

332
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
She's so cute.

333
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:34,000
She's the cutest little dickens
I ever saw.

334
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,440
No. I just--

335
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I don't think it's healthy.

336
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
To hell with it!

337
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I'd pick all the roses in China
for that girl.

338
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,700
And there's nothing you can say
that'll change my mind.

339
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,840
Robert.

340
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Mildred, Ada, are you all right?

341
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
It's a miracle is what it is.

342
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
My word!

343
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
The Lord has visited his grace on you,
Elinore. Isn't that right, Mildred?

344
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I do believe we are all
witness to an event...

345
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,000
of great spiritual magnitude.

346
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I think what we're witness to
is some of the f'inest work...

347
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
with needle and thread
that we may ever see...

348
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
short of a skilled surgeon.

349
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Well, if that don't take
the whole biscuit.

350
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Who would go to all this trouble?

351
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
It's moral restitution.

352
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
What did you say?

353
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
A symbol, Mrs. Murphy...

354
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
to cancel out the wrong.

355
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
It is the view of my late lamented
father that whenever possible...

356
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:47,000
we must balance what we ought not to do
with what we ought.

357
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Why, how very nice of you,
Mrs. Murphy.

358
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Now, if you are not
completely satisf'ied...

359
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
there will be no charge for the work.

360
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Now, if you would come over here.

361
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
You'll have to tell me exactly
what's needed to be done...

362
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,400
on each article of clothing.

363
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I had to see this myself.

364
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Word sure travels fast around here.

365
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Well, you're talkin'
about the Lord's work.

366
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
There's no stopping
tongues from waggin'.

367
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
My, look at this.

368
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Hey, I hope you're not too mad.

369
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:48,000
l guess I gave the boys some bad advice,
I reckon, on how to court women.

370
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,840
Uh-huh.

371
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
No lawman should have any part
in aiding and abetting a flower thief.

372
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Well, lucky for you
I can usually spot good intentions.

373
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
- Okay, now, put it down.
- No, I'm gonna get you.

374
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
What's that?
Good Lord, you fell for that.

375
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Let's go, red birds.

376
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Come on. Catch the bombs.

377
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I got you now.
What'd you think I was pulling at?

378
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,000
- lf I was you, I'd run. Go!
- Don't you dare squirt me!

379
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
He's not happy.

380
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Cardinal fans, give him
a round of applause.

381
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I might as well.

382
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I'll be around.
That's my job.

383
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
- When are you gonna f'ix this fence?
- Speaking of jobs--

384
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Hey, Billy Bob...

385
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
you ever notice how Speedy's always
talking real sweet to your mom?

386
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
What are you saying?

387
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I was saying nothing.
I was just wondering if you noticed.

388
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I know what you're getting at,
and you might as well forget it.

389
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
It ain't never gonna happen.

390
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Ball one.

391
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm at your service, ma'am.
Take care.

392
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
- Thank you.
- As you were.

393
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
strike one. swing. Oh, boy.

394
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,800
Careful driving.

395
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Oh, no, it's a foul ball.

396
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,900
Whoa. What's this?

397
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
-It's just old Rosalba Cat.
-What's she doing in Miss Sawyer's yard?

398
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Just taking a shortcut from the f'ield
over yonder, I reckon.

399
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Taking a shortcut without even asking?

400
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
It's a free country, Preach.

401
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:51,000
- A grand slam home run.
- Says who?

402
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,550
stan The Man has done it again.

403
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
- You want them berries?
- Gosh, Preach, what are you doing?

404
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Are you trying to ruin our trip
to the World Series?

405
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
- You gotta pay the tariff.
- What kind of tariff you talking about?

406
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
- I'm not paying a tariff.
- Then you don't get no berries.

407
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Gosh, don't do it, Preach!

408
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:36,000
- Gosh dang it!
- Give me that.

409
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
What's this for anyway?
You know you can't read nothing.

410
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I can read better than you.

411
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Preacher, leave her be!
She didn't do anything to us! Dang it!

412
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Dang you, Preacher!

413
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Stop that, you boys!

414
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Stop this instant!

415
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Don't you know that gentlemen...

416
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:13,000
are put on the face of this Earth
for the protection of ladies?

417
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,700
Let me help you with your berries.

418
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Lord knows this town
has been witness...

419
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
to every kind of yours
and Preacher's mischief.

420
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
But cruelty is another thing entirely.

421
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,350
I am so afraid you'll grow up
to be someone I will not care to know.

422
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
You've got to be something!

423
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Little lady!
She steal something from you?

424
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Oh, no, of course not.

425
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Miss, please!

426
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Wait! Let me give you your book.

427
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,840
Please.

428
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Heaven knows there's a limited supply oF
adequate reading material in this town.

429
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
- Now, are you all right?
- I'm f'ine.

430
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Honestly, do you suppose
boys behave like this...

431
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
in towns like Memphis,
New York, Hollywood...

432
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
or Cairo of Egypt?

433
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,250
Here.

434
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,250
Blow.

435
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
It's a f'ine situation when a lady
can't walk safely in public daylight.

436
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Rosalba Cat.

437
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
- You best be coming home with us.
- Yes, Daddy.

438
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Where them berries
for your mama's pies?

439
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Sir, I can speak to an event
which recently transpired...

440
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
that caused your daughter
to arrive without the berries.

441
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Daddy, can I have
my friend stay and eat?

442
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Not today. Come on, now.

443
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
We are sisters now,
and I don't suspect...

444
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
those boys
will be bothering you anymore.

445
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Now, you come by our house tomorrow,
and we'll have a lovely day.

446
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,100
Oh, and my name's not ma'am.
It's LilyJane.

447
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
In light of the recent tragedy
that befell your mother's roses...

448
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
my mama's worked extra hard to
complete the repairs to your clothing.

449
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I just wanna say that I'm really sorry
about Rosalba Cat.

450
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I shouldn't have let it happen,
but I did.

451
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I must say I was very disappointed
by your behavior.

452
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
You look to be more genial.

453
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Yes, ma'am.
l'm genial as heck.

454
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,100
I hope you don't mind.

455
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
This handsome man must be your father.

456
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I, too, understand how it feels
to lose a loved one.

457
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Yeah. My mom said
that your dad died too.

458
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Actually, he's not truly
and totally deceased.

459
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Where is he?

460
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,850
He's not with us.

461
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Was he the reason you came here
to live in Meadow?

462
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I wouldn't say we ''live'' here.

463
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Not exactly.

464
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Not when I always
picture somewhere else...

465
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
where everything is dancing...

466
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Iike people dancing in the streets...

467
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
and everything is pretty...

468
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
like children on their birthdays.

469
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
It's not so bad here though, is it?

470
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Oh, goodness, no.

471
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I know that it was the next best thing
for us to move to this town.

472
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
And the next best thing
is often the best.

473
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Of course, my f'inal destination
has always been...

474
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
and will remain...

475
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Hollywood, California.

476
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
You see, my plan is to appear someday
in motion pictures.

477
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
You mean movies? For real?

478
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
That's right, Billy Bob.
Can't you just feel the excitement?

479
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,440
I can, yeah.

480
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,850
Here. Why don't you play the Victrola?
It works real good.

481
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
What are you doing here?

482
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
What do you mean? I thought
we were gonna go play some ball.

483
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Quiet. My mom's sleeping.

484
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I forgot. I got World Series money.
You know, chores to do.

485
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,200
I'll see you later. Bye.

486
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,560
So beautiful.

487
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Now, I'm not meddling.

488
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
At least I'd like to think l'm not...

489
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
even though l know I am.

490
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
But you're so remarkable,
and that boy of yours...

491
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
well, he needs a father.

492
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Well, Mildred, I'll just put a notice up
on the bulletin board at church.

493
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Good morning, Mrs. Murphy.

494
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I believe you know Sister Rosalba Cat.

495
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
- Of course. Hello, Rosalba.
- Ma'am.

496
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I came to discuss
a bit of business with you.

497
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Business? ls that so?

498
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Since it is impossible for me to pursue
my career in motion pictures here...

499
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
the next best thing for me...

500
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
is to start a small venture on the side,
which is what I have done.

501
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
A venture. I see.

502
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Sister Rosalba and I are the sole
subscription agents in this county...

503
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
for an impressive list of magazines.

504
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Oh, my!

505
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Girls, as much as
I'd love to help you, I--

506
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
To be short, Mrs. Murphy,
we're not here to sell you anything.

507
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I was thinking...

508
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,000
those two boys seem so idle...

509
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:07,000
and it occurred to me that they aren't
bad after all, at least in years.

510
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Do you suppose they would make
a likely pair of assistants?

511
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
l sure do.

512
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,000
You'll both make equal commissions
for the subscriptions you sell...

513
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
which we will pay you
at the end of every day.

514
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
You can save your money for college.

515
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
That is,
if you want to go to college...

516
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
because neither one of you have got
the brains to win a scholarship.

517
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
- Not even a football scholarship.
- I'll get a football scholarship.

518
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Yeah, he will.

519
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
These here are your sales packets.

520
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Don't be getting them dirty.

521
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Now, if you have any questions...

522
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Sister Rosalba or I
will be happy to answer them.

523
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:02,000
- Well, go on.
- Come on, Preach.

524
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
- Preach, you know what this means?
- I reckon I do.

525
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
- We're gonna make it to the Series!
- You reckon we will?

526
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
All right. You take
all the north-side houses...

527
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
and I'll take all the south,
all right?

528
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Whoa. We got something else
we need to take care of.

529
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
- What's that?
- You know what I'm talking about.

530
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
It's plain to see we both
can't court Miss Bobbit.

531
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I know you've been thinking about it
just like I have.

532
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
That's foolish talk.
I can care less.

533
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
You're lying!
And I know it if you don't.

534
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Like when you lied about having them
chores to do for the World Series dough.

535
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
All right. Fine. What are you
suggesting we do about it?

536
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I got a way we can settle things
once and for all, like gentlemen.

537
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
- Good!
- We do the selling.

538
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Whoever sells the most,
the other guy backs off.

539
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
- Fine!
- Good!

540
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
No, hold it. You got
three people in your family.

541
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
-They might sell you out the f'irst week.
-With what?

542
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,150
Stolen money, I reckon.

543
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Fine.

544
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Family don't count.

545
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,680
- Deal?
- Deal.

546
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,800
Excuse me.
Would you like a magazine?

547
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Hello, Ma'am.
Would you like to buy a magazine?

548
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
What do you think you're doing? I
thought this was my side of the street.

549
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
- It is.
- We had a deal, remember?

550
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
- No, you do what you want.
- You ain't gonna win this by cheating.

551
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
You cheated f'irst.

552
00:47:52,000 --> 00:48:01,000
But come Friday,
I'm gonna have me a new sweetheart.

553
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,320
Hello, sir.

554
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Billy Bob, I carry 32 magazines...

555
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
and 17 comic books.

556
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Oh, yeah.

557
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
No, sir.

558
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Thanks a lot, Mr. Trump.

559
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Don't slam that--

560
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Well, thanks anyway.

561
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Aw, Speedy.

562
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I'm kidding you.
I always like to support a worthy cause.

563
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Come on, Rosalba.

564
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I am. Wait a minute.
I'm still f'iguring.

565
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Ma'am, I got something
needs airing out.

566
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
And what might that be, Preacher?

567
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I hope you're checking your accounts
careful, because I got more than...

568
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
a sneaking suspicion that Billy Bob
ain't turning over all his money.

569
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Come on, Preacher.
That's a damn lie, and you know it.

570
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,000
You're the liar, Billy Bob,
and a cheat!

571
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
- I didn't steal nothing!
- Somebody do something!

572
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
You can't let him win, Billy Bob.
You can't.

573
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Stop it! Look at me!
What is wrong with you?

574
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
- Aw, honey, you've got to decide.
- Decide what, for goodness sake?

575
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,000
You've got to decide
who's your real, true sweetheart.

576
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Sweetheart? I should've known better
than to get involved...

577
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
with country bumpkins!

578
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
- But I was just--
- But nothing!

579
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Now you listen to me, Preacher Star!

580
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I don't want a sweetheart!

581
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,650
And if l did, it wouldn't be you!

582
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
She's a hard one, Billy Bob.

583
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
She don't want nothing
but to make trouble between friends.

584
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,500
Come on.
Let's go get us a pop.

585
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
- Are you working today, or what?
- What's the point?

586
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,200
l can't go to the World Series
all by myself.

587
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
What do you want me to do?

588
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,000
You can grab that jar of flatheads.
See them three fence pickets?

589
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:14,000
You can toss them
in the back of the truck.

590
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
- It's about dang time.
- Right down here.

591
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
All right.

592
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Malcolm, you're sure that your pops
is gonna let you go...

593
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:34,000
all the way to St. Louis with me
to the World Series?

594
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Up here at the top. Ready?
One, two--

595
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Don't cheat. Three.

596
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,440
Don't cheat?

597
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,000
We would like to invite you to enjoy
a game of three-handed bridge...

598
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
with me and Sister Rosalba.

599
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Have you ever played?

600
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
No,just poker with Pre--
Never mind.

601
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
That's of no importance.
We'll teach you.

602
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
- Won't we, Sister Rosabla?
- Yeah, I guess.

603
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Can we go in your tree house?

604
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,250
Yeah.

605
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
All right. Calm down.
Let the girls win, okay?

606
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
- Is that good advice or bad advice?
-Just go, go!

607
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,800
Thanks, Speedy.

608
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,100
Y'all pardon the mess.

609
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
- Reverend.
- Good morning.

610
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
- How's your mom?
- Good.

611
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Good to see you.

612
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,400
- Good morning.
- Come on in.

613
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I can't believe
you got me into this.

614
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Excuse me, Mrs. Sawyer.

615
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,300
We'll just squinch by you.

616
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Billy Bob, why don't you make some room
for the young ladies and Mrs. Bobbit.

617
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Thank you.

618
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,200
Excuse me.

619
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I planned all week to speak this morning
from the book of Luke, so I shall.

620
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Perhaps many of you are wondering
whether God or Satan...

621
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
moves among us this morning:

622
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
whether that clever deceiver Lucifer
is leading us toward the darkness.

623
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Do you recall how Jesus himself
answered the devil's temptation?

624
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,250
He said unto him,
"Get thee behind me, Satan."

625
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
- Yes, Miss Bobbit.
- Pastor Williams...

626
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but likeJesus...

627
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I've been sorely tempted
of the devil...

628
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:17,000
and can perhaps add some insight
to your sermon.

629
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I'm sure the congregation agrees with me
that we can always benef'it...

630
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,150
from the perspective...

631
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:34,000
- from being inside another's skin.
- That's enough.

632
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:34,900
Come on, Preacher.

633
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,150
This is just not right.

634
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:17,000
If anybody else wants to go,
please do so now.

635
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,250
Do continue, Miss Bobbit.

636
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
First of all, sir...

637
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
it's easy to sit here
on a Sunday morning...

638
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
and talk about being righteous...

639
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
yet let the devil whisper
his meanness in your ear.

640
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
And it is another thing entirely
to resist the devil...

641
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
and be truly compassionate.

642
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
lf merely one person
invites him around...

643
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
the devil can whisper
through a whole town.

644
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
And suddenly everyone's lost
their sense of decency.

645
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Even those who think
they've got him behind them...

646
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
can't get his lies
out of their ears.

647
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
If I understand you, Miss Bobbit,
I believe you're saying that...

648
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
even those who consider
themselves righteous...

649
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
sometimes need to look
in the mirror...

650
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,000
and see if that's the person
they want to see looking back at them.

651
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Sir, you have understood me
perfectly.

652
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Jesus also tells us
to love the outcast among us.

653
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
That we may become
the true children of our father.

654
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,100
- Amen.
- That's right.

655
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
God bless you, Sheriff.

656
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Let us pray from the gospel
according to Luke.

657
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
"Blessed are you
when men shall hate you:

658
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,000
when they shall separate you from
their company for their Lord's sake.

659
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
For the whole of your reward
is great in heaven."

660
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,680
- Amen.
- Amen.

661
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,440
There we go.

662
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Come on, Rosalba.

663
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I'm gonna teach you
how to dance. Now, okay.

664
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,000
So you put your
hand on my shoulder.

665
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
I'll be the leading man.
And I'll put my hand on your hip.

666
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
And we'll both adjoin hands
like this.

667
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
And we go--
one, two, three.

668
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,000
One, two, three. Back.
One, two, three. One, two, three.

669
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
That's it. You'll be ready
for the cotillion in no time.

670
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I've never been
to a cotillion before.

671
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:45,000
There is a f'irst for everything,
isn't there?

672
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Well, isn't this a f'ine sight.

673
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
A white girl and a colored
dancing in the noonday sun.

674
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Now you listen to me.
You may f'ind this type of behavior...

675
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
acceptable in the woods
where you grew up...

676
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
but in the presence
of ladies--

677
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
You ain't no lady.

678
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Everyone knows you ain't
nothing but a floozy.

679
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Why, Sister Rosalba.

680
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I do believe we'll be ready
for the cotillion in no time.

681
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I'm just a dumb colored
and that's what I'll always be.

682
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Oh, is little Billy Bob hurt?
Shame on you.

683
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,700
You made old Billy Bob
bleed blood.

684
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I'm gonna come back
and get my gun!

685
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,000
It's not right to treat
people this way.

686
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Billy Bob Murphy, that was
a very brave thing you did.

687
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,000
- It was?
- Brave and foolish.

688
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Now we're going to have our picnic,
and we're going to dance.

689
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
You know how l feel
about violence.

690
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
But, Ma, you should have heard all
the horrible things they were saying.

691
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
I know. Those Star boys
have been needing a lesson...

692
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
since the day
they learned to walk.

693
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
But I want you to promise me
something, son.

694
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
- What's that?
- I want you to promise me...

695
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
that you will not spend
the rest of your life...

696
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
defending the honor
of that little girl.

697
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
But Daddy always said if a lady
is in need of defending--

698
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I know what your father said.

699
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,000
And... it was good advice
at the time.

700
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:02,000
But right now l am asking you
to do this thing for me.

701
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,440
You promise?

702
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
I can't promise.

703
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:09,850
But I'll try, Ma.

704
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I'll see your nickel
and raise a nickel.

705
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
So what'd you do when he said
he wasn't interested, Mr. Quince?

706
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Well, gentlemen, I simply looked
Mr. Louis B. Mayer square in the eyes...

707
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
and I said, "Sir, there's
no choice in the matter.

708
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
That little girl's gonna
be the biggest thing in pictures."

709
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
And that is how Miss Lana Turner
went from sweater girl...

710
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,000
to movie star overnight.

711
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:53,000
$$ "U.S. Occupation of Germany"

712
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I'll see you
and raise you a dime, Mr. Trump.

713
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Don't try to bluff me, sir.
I warn you.

714
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,000
I'll see the dime
and raise another nickel.

715
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I believe you're the f'irst celebrities
we ever had in Meadow, Mr. Quince.

716
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
- Well, that's very kind of you, sir.
- I think a man on the cover...

717
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
of Life magazine
qualif'ies as a celebrity.

718
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:23,000
That's right, pumpkin. How can we forget
about the greasy man under the hood?

719
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,000
It must take a real gift
to spot talent like you do.

720
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Who else did you discover
for Hollywood, Mr. Quince?

721
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Well, nobody this week,
but I am hopeful.

722
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Which gives me a little idea.
I'll see you and call.

723
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Whoa,Jeb, too good.
Too darn good for me.

724
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
That's too darn good.

725
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,000
You know, I bet you got a star
in the making right here in Meadow.

726
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
You know, we could put on
a talent contest.

727
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
First prize, a trip to Hollywood...

728
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
and a screen test
with Mr. Louis B. Mayer.

729
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
- Yeah.
- What do you think of that idea, dove?

730
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
That is a beautiful idea, Lionel.

731
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
You're not joking
with us now, are ya?

732
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Sir, I do not joke
about Mr. Louis B. Mayer.

733
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Now we've gotta get organized.

734
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
We could do it next Monday--
No, Monday I got--

735
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Then I got something on Tuesday.
Wed--

736
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
- We'll do it next Thursday.
- I'll get a committee together...

737
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,000
and we'll getup the church
like we do with the Christmas pageant.

738
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
- We'll need to let everyone know.
- Oh, I'll take care of that.

739
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Gentlemen, it looks like
we got ourselves an event.

740
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Now, Mr. Speedy,
you may want to sign up...

741
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,000
so you can showcase
your belt-tightening prowess.

742
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:43,000
"Dazzling and tremendous,
how quick the sunrise will kill me."

743
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Talent show! Here!
Louis B. Mayer! Thursday!

744
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:54,000
- Hollywood, Lilly Jane!
- At last.

745
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
- That's a good one, Mr. Quince.
- Thank you, Mr. Dixon.

746
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
- You're welcome.
- What you get?

747
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,000
I never heard that one before.
Oh, Lordy.

748
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Sir, Mr. Dixon,
now this is a f'ine cooler.

749
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
It is a perfect balance
of syrup and carbonation.

750
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Few men could achieve
such a tangy beverage.

751
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Well, thank you.
Thank you, sir.

752
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Mr. Quince, I don't mean to bother you,
but these here Star boys--

753
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
and I know you can't put stock
in what they say-- but they tell me...

754
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
you might have a line on some jobs
for our young men.

755
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Oh, I knew I couldn't
trust you boys.

756
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,000
- Knew it the minute l laid eyes on you.
-Just kinda slipped out, Mr. Quince.

757
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
-Just plopped out.
- Is it true, Mr. Quince?

758
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Well, I guess the secret's
out now, isn't it? All right.

759
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
But you gotta promise
to keep it between us.

760
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Now as you might surmise,
I have certain connections...

761
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
certain relationships and I
should not be telling you this...

762
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
but any boy of legal age
comes to me...

763
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
with $150 deposit
for up-front expenses...

764
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
shall receive a position
on one of several fruit vessels...

765
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,000
that make the journey from New Orleans
to the continent of South America.

766
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I know this sounds like
a steep price to pay...

767
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
but my goodness, imagine the experience
that your boys will have...

768
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
as they sail down
to the sea in ships...

769
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,000
as Shakespeare noted.

770
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Or was it the other fella
who noted that?

771
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Who knows that?

772
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
So after a few years, he will
return home with his pockets full...

773
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:27,000
and his soul alive with tales
of living out in the high seas.

774
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Now remember--
keep this between us.

775
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Now, there's a limited number
of positions available...

776
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
and I, one man,
can only serve so many.

777
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
You'd have to give me
a couple of days.

778
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I could sell an option
on my crop.

779
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,450
Well, you do that, sir.
Ma'am?

780
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Great pie.

781
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:56,000
She didn't sleep a wink.

782
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Ada, you've been saving
for that angel headstone...

783
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
since Walter passed on.

784
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
And now you're gonna give it away
to this Quince man?

785
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
- Yeah.
- We don't know anything about him.

786
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Time is all I have left, Elinore.

787
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:19,000
I just think it's time l started
concentrating on the living.

788
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Excuse me!

789
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
We can't clap for anybody else.
We gotta save it all for Miss Bobbit.

790
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,200
Now, Billy Bob,
let's not forget our manners.

791
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
the f'irst annual Meadow Talent Show.

792
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I am your proud and humble
producer, Lionel Quince.

793
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
All right, Lionel!

794
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Thank you very much.

795
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
First off, we're gonna meet
a young lady, Evelyn Linford...

796
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,100
who does her own choreography
to swan Lake.

797
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,320
She stinks.

798
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Perfume from your mama.

799
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I think l saw Billy Bob
in the audience.

800
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,440
That's nice.

801
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,150
Now, she really stinks.

802
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,000
"O, Romeo, Romeo,
where for art thou, Romeo?

803
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Deny thy father
and refuse thy name...

804
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
or if thou wilst not--

805
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
And for thy name
which is not part of thee...

806
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
take all of myself."

807
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,560
Yes, Captain!

808
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the Lord

809
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,000
He was wearing pink pajamas
He was driving in a Ford

810
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the Lord

811
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Captain Bryant, one moment, please.
Continue playing, son.

812
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
- Preacher Star.
- Lionel Quince does not cotton...

813
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
to the bespattering
of the American soldier.

814
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Captain Bryant, the chorus!

815
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Glory, glory, hallelujah

816
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:16,000
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.

817
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Open my eyes and what do I see
Trouble is looking right back at me

818
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,000
With a face that I
just love to call my own

819
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
so I turned to the mirror
to scream and shout

820
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Please, help me, Lord
Please help me out

821
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:36,000
I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't wanna-- Things that don't change

822
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Come on, honey, take a good look now
'cause trouble is coming to town

823
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Preacher Star.
Son, you better get ahold of yourself.

824
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:05,000
- Dear mother, sweet mother
- Boo!

825
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:10,000
- Easy, Acey. Come on.
- Get off of me. l want him now.

826
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
I'll be seeing you in

827
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
All the old familiar places

828
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,000
That this heart
of mine embraces

829
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,800
All day through

830
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
ln that small cafe

831
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,000
The park across the way

832
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,150
The children's carousel

833
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I'll be seeing you in

834
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Every lovely summer's day

835
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:50,000
In everything
that's light and gay

836
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,000
If you have any respect for anyone
on God's green earth...

837
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,000
- I'll f'i'nd you in the morning sun
- then stop.

838
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:01,000
And when the night is new

839
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:06,000
I'll be looking at the moon

840
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:06,900
But I'll be seeing

841
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000
- You
- I'll be seeing

842
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:16,750
You

843
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
- Yeah!
- Nicely done!

844
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Yes! Great! Beautiful!

845
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
-Just beautiful!
- Beautiful!

846
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,000
And now we come to
our f'inal contestant.

847
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
It says here that she'll be singing
an original composition.

848
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,450
Please welcome to the stage
Miss LillyJane Bobbit.

849
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Well, would you
look at that child?

850
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:54,950
What lies before me

851
01:11:59,000 --> 01:11:59,950
What stands between

852
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,000
No one can tell me

853
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,000
What I have seen

854
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,000
some see the tarnish

855
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,000
I see the gleam

856
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I have to wonder

857
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,080
I have to

858
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,250
Dream

859
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
One dream can change you

860
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,000
One dream can make

861
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,000
All the difference

862
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,000
One heart can take

863
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,000
I dream offlying

864
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,000
I'm in midair

865
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I have to wonder

866
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,800
What's up there

867
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
The sky's the limit

868
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,800
Today's the day

869
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Heavens are still there

870
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:27,000
When skies are gray

871
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:31,000
some days are better

872
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Then they seem

873
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
some days are better

874
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Because you dream

875
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,000
On rainbows to rainbows

876
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,000
On starlight to star

877
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
To dream, isn't that what

878
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Tomorrow is for

879
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Only a dreamer

880
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Knows what l know

881
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
What it's like to wonder

882
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:09,000
And then let go

883
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
On rainbows to rainbows

884
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
I know what I seem

885
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I have to wonder

886
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:20,720
I have

887
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:22,960
To dream

888
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Patti Page,
eat your heart out.

889
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Well, now, folks, l don't think
there's any question, do you?

890
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Congratulations! And you
people remember this little gal...

891
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
'cause she's gonna be somebody.

892
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,100
Miss LillyJane Bobbit!

893
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Remember, everybody, you must be right
here Monday morning at 10:00 precisely.

894
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
- Don't you worry about that.
- God bless you.

895
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
A representative of the lnternational
Fruit Company will be here...

896
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:17,000
to greet you and give departure times
and boat itineraries.

897
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
And Miss LillyJane Bobbit...

898
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
since these people
are personal friends of mine...

899
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
they will also
deliver your itinerary...

900
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,000
as well as your f'irst-class
travel arrangements to Hollywood.

901
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,800
Now I shall precede you there
and prepare the red carpet.

902
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
- Bye, Mr. Quince.
- Mr. Quince.

903
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
I sure hope
l haven't misjudged you.

904
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,000
- I assure you, sir, you have not.
- Bye-bye, hon.

905
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:55,000
- Bye-bye. Take good care.
- Bye, Mr. Quince.

906
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,700
Bye, Mr. Quince.
See you next year.

907
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,100
- Careful.
- I'm sorry.

908
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,600
$$ "Picken's County Flower Show"

909
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,750
Well, then,
are we all in agreement?

910
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
I sometimes look at Billy Bob...

911
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:50,000
and think it was Robert who should
have come back and me that didn't.

912
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,800
Don't say that.

913
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
I swear, if I'm
still standing upright...

914
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
by the time those judges
make their decision...

915
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,300
it'll be a miracle of God.

916
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,550
I miss the heck out of him too.

917
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:27,000
I'm gonna take Billy Bob
f'ishin' one afternoon.

918
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:27,840
Well...

919
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Donald, I think that's between
you and Billy Bob.

920
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,250
Okay.

921
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,000
- You'll announce it.
- Yeah.

922
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:48,000
First prize to Mrs. Murphy.

923
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
- Fine horticulture.
- Congratulations.

924
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,200
Thank you.

925
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Congratulations, Mom!

926
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,350
Last one in's a rotten egg!

927
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,000
What time is it, Mom?
ls it time yet?

928
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Two minutes till 10:00.

929
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,000
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning, Pastor.

930
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Congratulations, LillyJane.

931
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,000
I thought you'd like
some reading material for your trip.

932
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,000
"The Devil and Daniel Webster."

933
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Oh, that's so kind.

934
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:56,000
I've also enclosed my address,
should you care to exchange ideas.

935
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:03,000
- That's a very pretty skirt.
- Thanks.

936
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:07,000
- Is it time yet, Ma?
- It is 10:00.

937
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
- I don't see anybody yet.
- All right.

938
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,450
-Just now 10:00.
- He'll be here. Good to see you.

939
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
We can't give up hope, son.

940
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Son, I think we should go home.

941
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Can't we just stay
for a little bit longer?

942
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,000
It's been f'ive hours.

943
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:46,000
You know what? I bet
the fruit company guy got car trouble.

944
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Don't you be laughing, Preacher.

945
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,950
Believe me, Billy Bob,
I ain't laughin'.

946
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Folks, I got some bad news.

947
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:09,000
I just got off the phone
with the sheriff over in Dagsville.

948
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
The fruit company fella
was supposed to show up there last week.

949
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,450
- He never showed.
- Oh, dear.

950
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Mom, this is so cruel.

951
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,320
Yes, it is.

952
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,000
When he hits your neck of the woods,
you beware.

953
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
And let me know.

954
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Appreciate it.

955
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:41,000
You sure you don't know where
that Quince fella was headed?

956
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Nope. Told you, sure don't.

957
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Well, you keep
your two eyes out.

958
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Good luck with that
old clunker of yours.

959
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,000
lt needs more than
a new battery to get her going.

960
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,000
- Well, thanks, Sheriff Speedy.
- You bet.

961
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,300
- Take care now.
- Bye-bye.

962
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Hey, Speed.
Let me ask you something.

963
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Why would them Star brothers buy
a battery with money they don't got...

964
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
- for a clunker ain't got no engine?
- How would you know that?

965
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,000
'Cause I bought the engine block from
that heap of junk week ago Thursday.

966
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Acey, take Townline Road.
Jeb, take the river.

967
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,000
We're gonna f'ind this character.
I do not like being made a fool of.

968
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
- Let's go, boys.
- Let's get 'im!

969
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:28,960
Come on.

970
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Let's hunt him down!

971
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,000
I think it's just a shame
about you and Preacher.

972
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:47,000
How much fun do you think it'll be to go
to that World Series all by yourself?

973
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:57,000
I don't think I'm going to be able
to count on Preach, Mom.

974
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Mom, can I be excused?

975
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Sure.
Take your plate, please.

976
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,080
Yes, Mom.

977
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,000
- What is this?
- It's an '"nimous" note.

978
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:23,000
What Sister Rosalba means
is that this is an anonymous note.

979
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,000
No, she doesn't.
That right there is an ''onimous'' note.

980
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Anyway, we received it
earlier this evening.

981
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
What are we gonna do? Sheriff Speedy
and them left this afternoon.

982
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Time has come to take action, Billy Bob.

983
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,850
Fortunately,
l have formulated a plan.

984
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
$$ "Speedy's Garage"

985
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,400
We're off to save the world!

986
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
I am starting
to get the hang of this.

987
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:16,850
You are. You are.

988
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,000
We're getting there,
and we're gonna be very quiet now.

989
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,500
We're gonna walk like lndians.

990
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,440
There he is.

991
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:19,960
Come on.

992
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Well, Mr. Lionel Quince.

993
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Well, if it isn't
my little starlet.

994
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Mr. Quince,
by the authority vested in me...

995
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,000
by the state of Alabama
and the US Constitution...

996
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:53,000
I am placing you
under citizen's arrest.

997
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Now, if you would please
come with me.

998
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Citizen's arrest?

999
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Whoo! You do have a flair
for the theatrics.

1000
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
That's it?
That's your big plan?

1001
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,000
By law, he must comply
with my instructions.

1002
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
He's a crook.
He doesn't care about the law!

1003
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Your friend's right. Why don't you
listen and move along...

1004
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
before something terrible
happens to you.

1005
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,000
We're not leaving here
until you agree to come with us!

1006
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
That is just not possible.

1007
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Hey, pumpkin, what's...
going on here?

1008
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:27,000
We have no quarrel with you.
l trust you understand my distress.

1009
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Mr. Quince broke
his contractual obligation to me...

1010
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
and many of the f'ine people
of Meadow.

1011
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Little girl, you've wasted
too much of my time.

1012
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Normally I don't make it a habit
to harm children, but in your case...

1013
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
I'm gonna make an exception!

1014
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:43,000
- Billy Bob, submarine!
- Submarine!

1015
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Anybody! My legs!
What are you doing?

1016
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:47,900
Get me outta here!

1017
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Billy Bob and Miss Bobbit
and that other little girl are missing.

1018
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:18,000
- When's the last time you saw 'em?
- Speedy, that sounds like your truck.

1019
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,150
- Watch out!
- Look out!

1020
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
- Hi, Mom.
- Billy Bob! Preacher!

1021
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Ladies and gentlemen, there's
been a terrible misunderstanding.

1022
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Mr. Quince, l'm sure we're real anxious
to hear what you got to say...

1023
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:43,000
but just now,
put a cork in it.

1024
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Sheriff, got one more for ya.

1025
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:46,900
There's our money!

1026
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,000
- We want our money back!
- Hold it. You'll get your money...

1027
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,000
just as soon as we f'igure out
who belongs to what.

1028
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
The important thing is
that everyone...

1029
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
will surely get
what's coming to them.

1030
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,000
I don't think everyone
will get what's coming to them.

1031
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Seems to me if it weren't
for that little girl...

1032
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:14,000
you'd all still be standing here
with your pockets empty.

1033
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,000
It's a magical night.

1034
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,000
A magical night.

1035
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,000
- We didn't do nothing, Sheriff Speedy.
- You gotta believe us.Jeb, tell him.

1036
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Aiding and abetting
a felon or something.

1037
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
We're still gonna get our money,
right, Mr. Quince?

1038
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Mr. Trump, could you pull off to
the side of the road? I gotta make one.

1039
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Hey, Preacher.

1040
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,000
So why'd you send
that whole ominous note thing?

1041
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Well, I didn't f'igure
that I could do that whole...

1042
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,450
moral restitution deal alone.

1043
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,000
All right. You can throw
'cause you got the better arm...

1044
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,600
- but don't miss.
- I won't miss.

1045
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
"Dear LillyJane:

1046
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,000
We give this note in hopes
it will help you achieve your dream...

1047
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,000
of making it to Hollywood.

1048
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:51,000
We ask for nothing in return
but to remain your devoted...

1049
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
and anonymous admirers.

1050
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,000
P.S. lf you try
and give it back...

1051
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,000
we will just toss it
into the garbage...

1052
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:06,000
so you might as well keep it."

1053
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Two and two the count.

1054
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
Got the chance in here
with the fish scaler.

1055
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Here's the pitch to Kiner.
It's a long fly to right.

1056
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Back, back, back.
Country slaughter tries to run it down.

1057
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,000
He's got it.l

1058
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Here we go, Billy Bob.

1059
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:27,000
- With that play, the Birds stand...
- I'll get us a couple pops.

1060
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
two-and-a-half games
away in second place.

1061
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,000
And our Birds led again tonight
by stan "The Man" Musial.

1062
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,000
His second four-hit game.
Coming back from that appendectomy...

1063
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:39,000
thatjust about sunk our season.

1064
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,300
Now, tomorrow, our Birds--

1065
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Do angels walk

1066
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Do angels talk

1067
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Do angels come along
every day

1068
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:03,000
- I'm not gonna die, you know.
- Do angels stand still

1069
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Do angels fil

1070
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:10,000
The empty places along the way

1071
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:10,850
Heaven only knows

1072
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:23,000
You'll come out to Hollywood,
and we'll climb a mountain.

1073
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:33,000
And we'll all live together,
you and me and Sister Rosalba.

1074
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:33,850
Heaven only knows

1075
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Heaven knows the way I feel

1076
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Tell me are angels real

1077
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,000
- Would you do me the honor?
- lt looks like

1078
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,200
Looks like heaven's here

1079
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Heaven, the reddest rose

1080
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:14,850
Heaven only knows

1081
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:36,850
Heaven only knows

1082
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Heaven knows the way I feel

1083
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Tell me are angels real

1084
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:56,000
It looks like

1085
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,000
- Looks like
- Thank you, Billy Bob.

1086
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Heaven's here

1087
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,250
Thank you for everything.

1088
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,100
Be careful, LillyJane.

1089
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:57,000
I guess I got this for you.

1090
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,600
I can't imagine
what it could be.

1091
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Why, it's beautiful.
Thank you.

1092
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:27,000
It's only fitting that you should
be the first to use it.

1093
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,100
Boys, those nice roses are gonna
waste just sitting over there.

1094
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:50,800
Let me help you.

1095
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,200
Thank you.

1096
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,250
Hurry up, girls. Come on.

1097
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,200
Have a safe trip.
Thanks.

1098
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,200
$$ "Super"

1099
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:14,000
This is Mrs. Quince's brooch.

1100
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,750
- Where'd you get that?
- Don't ask.

1101
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:35,800
No, you keep it.

1102
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Would you like to come in
for a cold lemonade?

1103
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Well, I'm not sure we have enough time
for a cold drink right now.

1104
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:55,000
I do. I have time.

1105
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:58,000
- Come on, Rosalba.
- See you at home, Ma.

1106
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:03,000
- We'll walk her home, Miss Cat.
- All right there, you young people.

1107
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,800
All right then.

1108
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:14,000
- Billy Bob?
- Oh, right. Come on, Cora Mae.

1109
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:18,000
You know, I really thought you were
a close second in the talent show.

1110
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Really? Billy Bob,
that's awful nice of you to say.

1111
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,000
And, Janice, that tap dancing
and juggling...

1112
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
I couldn't have done that.

1113
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Preacher Star, I know you left that
squirrel at the top of that bridge.

1114
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:36,000
some see the tarnish

1115
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,000
I see the gleam

1116
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:44,000
I have to wonder

1117
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,080
I have to

1118
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Dream
