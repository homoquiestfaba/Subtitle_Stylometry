1
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,154
Juan de la Cruz!

2
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,409
I'm a friend of your cousin, Felipe.

3
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,459
Are you Juan?

4
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,127
Can we talk?

5
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:55,922
Sure. But not here.

6
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,471
I'm done in about four hours.

7
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:15,108
You need to leave now. They're coming.

8
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:42,135
Do you own anything?

9
00:05:46,973 --> 00:05:47,974
No.

10
00:05:50,727 --> 00:05:53,062
Can you read or write?

11
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:58,192
Well... No.

12
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:00,319
Of course not.

13
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:10,079
Who in your family works?

14
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,128
Me and my wife.

15
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:22,258
And my kids. The older ones anyways.

16
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:26,137
The other ones are still too young.

17
00:06:28,765 --> 00:06:31,142
Do you want more for your kids?

18
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:34,687
Of course.

19
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:38,608
But...

20
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:46,074
Most of the people are afraid.

21
00:06:48,076 --> 00:06:51,329
They have to feed their kids.

22
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:01,339
It's not easy doing it alone.

23
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:08,805
I'll return in one month
to help you start organizing.

24
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:12,350
But I need you to gather
everyone you can here.

25
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,773
Ok, that's fine.

26
00:07:19,816 --> 00:07:22,443
And you won't be alone anymore.

27
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:17,459
What is happening here in Delano

28
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,296
is the same thing that is happening
in Salinas or in Stockton.

29
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:23,924
If we don't get organized,
the bosses are going to treat us like...

30
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:25,301
Excuse me.

31
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:27,177
Who are you?

32
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:47,615
My daughter has some questionnaires.

33
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:49,908
We want to know what concerns you.

34
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:51,452
Come on, just do that for us.

35
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,479
Come on. There's nothing to see here.

36
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:31,899
Nobody leave!

37
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,611
Stay together, stay strong!

38
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:29,873
Our brother Cesar Chavez
will speak to us now.

39
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:36,588
Brothers and sisters.

40
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:42,219
Today our fellow Filipino workers
have taken a vital step

41
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:45,889
towards the fight for freedom and dignity

42
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:48,517
that poverty has denied us.

43
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:55,691
And they have come to us
and asked a very important question.

44
00:21:56,149 --> 00:22:02,072
Whether we're prepared to set
our differences apart and join their strike.

45
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:09,955
But the most important thing to consider

46
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,543
is if news of this strike remains only in
Delano, then we will have been defeated.

47
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:21,341
Because they not only own the land,
but also the police and judges.

48
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:28,473
If we show the world
their abuse, greed, and brutality

49
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,978
then our voice will be heard
and responded to.

50
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:37,983
And when they see that our actions are just

51
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:41,903
they will understand that our cause is just.

52
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:46,408
Then we will prevail.
Yes we can!

53
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,499
Strike! I

54
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:17,350
Long live the strike!

55
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:20,312
Long live the farmworker!

56
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:23,231
Long live our cause!

57
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:26,902
Long live our farmworker movement!

58
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:03,188
Keep marching. Keep marching, please.

59
00:30:49,182 --> 00:30:50,475
Strike!

60
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:52,560
Strike!

61
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:01,945
Strike!

62
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:19,772
Everyone gather up.

63
00:32:28,031 --> 00:32:30,366
Who's thirsty?

64
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:34,495
Here, have some cold water.

65
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:36,372
It's free...

66
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:42,420
I've been told that some union members

67
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:46,716
affiliated with the communist party

68
00:32:48,593 --> 00:32:51,846
have been talking with you.

69
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:57,352
Making promises.
These promises are nothing but lies.

70
00:32:57,435 --> 00:33:00,730
You could even end up in jail.

71
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:05,401
And for what?

72
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:09,113
What's wrong, Cruz?

73
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:11,574
Aren't you thirsty?

74
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:17,914
If any of you has a problem,
tell me about it.

75
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:22,210
We don't want any problems here.

76
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:45,520
We're here to help.

77
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:47,688
Don't be afraid.

78
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:50,525
United we will stand.

79
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:52,360
They will not defeat us.

80
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:54,403
United we will stand.

81
00:35:54,529 --> 00:35:55,947
They will not defeat us.

82
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:58,282
This movement is for you, the people.

83
00:36:00,284 --> 00:36:03,704
They will not defeat us.

84
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:07,375
Long live the strike!

85
00:36:08,543 --> 00:36:10,378
Long live Cesar Chavez!

86
00:36:11,546 --> 00:36:13,714
Son! Son!

87
00:36:13,798 --> 00:36:17,385
They're not paying you enough!
Come join us!

88
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:20,596
Join the cause!

89
00:36:21,097 --> 00:36:24,058
Son, they're not paying you enough.

90
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:26,602
Don't betray your people.

91
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:29,397
Hey, come join us!

92
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:30,982
Come!

93
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:33,150
Don't be afraid!

94
00:46:02,094 --> 00:46:04,888
If we leave at 10 p.m.,
we can catch them in Modesto.

95
00:46:04,972 --> 00:46:06,181
Yeah, I know Dad.

96
00:46:11,478 --> 00:46:14,064
We're going to see your dad
and from there we can go home.

97
00:46:14,148 --> 00:46:15,566
I don't want to see my Dad.

98
00:46:15,649 --> 00:46:17,234
He'll be happy to see you!

99
00:46:17,317 --> 00:46:18,485
He won't even know I'm there.

100
00:46:57,483 --> 00:46:59,026
I am glad you came.

101
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:00,777
I am glad you came.

102
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:03,530
Donations.

103
00:47:03,864 --> 00:47:04,865
Boots.

104
00:47:57,417 --> 00:48:01,964
In colors, in colors,

105
00:48:02,089 --> 00:48:06,051
are the little birds that come from outside.

106
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:10,722
In colors, in colors,

107
00:48:10,806 --> 00:48:15,018
is the rainbow that we see shining.

108
00:48:15,185 --> 00:48:18,021
And that is why I love

109
00:48:18,146 --> 00:48:19,606
The great loves of many colors

110
00:55:22,946 --> 00:55:24,864
It's time for his nap, Sir.

111
00:55:32,539 --> 00:55:34,332
Yes, sir.

112
00:55:44,259 --> 00:55:45,760
Yes, sir.

113
01:05:21,002 --> 01:05:22,211
Dear brothers and sisters.

114
01:05:22,295 --> 01:05:24,839
As we prepare to celebrate
the mystery of Christ's love,

115
01:05:24,922 --> 01:05:26,465
let us acknowledge our sins.

116
01:05:26,966 --> 01:05:28,968
I confess to almighty God

117
01:05:29,135 --> 01:05:33,055
and to you, my brothers and sisters,
that I have sinned through my own fault

118
01:05:33,139 --> 01:05:35,891
in my thoughts and in my words,
in what I have done and have failed to do.

119
01:05:35,975 --> 01:05:38,644
Through my fault, through my fault
through my most grievous fault.

120
01:09:16,278 --> 01:09:18,447
- Hi.
- Hi Cruz, how're you doing?

121
01:09:18,531 --> 01:09:21,492
I brought my cousins to sign the pledge,
they just crossed the border.

122
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,702
Well done, have them sign.

123
01:09:27,248 --> 01:09:28,457
Look.

124
01:09:28,582 --> 01:09:30,626
I brought Cesar some food.

125
01:09:30,876 --> 01:09:33,879
Please tell him to eat something
and stop being stubborn.

126
01:11:10,851 --> 01:11:13,103
And he took bread in his hands

127
01:11:13,437 --> 01:11:14,730
blessed it

128
01:11:15,814 --> 01:11:18,484
and gave it to his disciples and said

129
01:11:19,276 --> 01:11:21,070
"Take this all of you, and eat it"

130
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:23,572
"this is my body
which will be given up for you."

131
01:11:23,656 --> 01:11:26,033
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

132
01:19:10,956 --> 01:19:13,250
Everyone, stop working for a minute.

133
01:19:13,625 --> 01:19:15,544
Come, join the strike.
Cesar Chavez wants to defend you!

134
01:20:24,821 --> 01:20:26,865
Slow down!

135
01:20:27,365 --> 01:20:29,868
Slow down! Slow down!

136
01:20:37,209 --> 01:20:40,378
- Call an ambulance!
- Juan!Juan!

137
01:20:41,796 --> 01:20:43,381
Help! Help!

138
01:32:11,319 --> 01:32:12,820
Yes, we can!
