1
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:18,768
What are you doing? Come back.

2
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,772
- No.
- Come on. Turn around.

3
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,240
Hey, hey!

4
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,781
You're the best.
You're amazing.

5
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,120
What do you say?
Beers on me. Cold beers on me.

6
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,257
Let's go!

7
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,233
Wonderful.
Weren't they wonderful?

8
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,645
Come on.
Keep it going, Gray.

9
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,894
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Help!

10
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,830
- Okay.
- Help.

11
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,734
- Don't rush over, okay?
- You pick up something for dinner?

12
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,896
- Yeah. Mmm.
- What do you got?

13
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,669
- Okay, I got us steak.
- Good.

14
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:12,233
- And chicken.
- Good.

15
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,212
- And fish.
- And fish.

16
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,372
- And tofu.
<i>- Good.</i>

17
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,008
- And tempeh.
- Oh, great. We got tempeh.

18
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,052
Then I got the regular essentials,
like asparagus and lettuce.

19
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,053
I got it.

20
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:25,056
I'm not home, okay?
Don't answer it, okay? Let's—

21
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:28,890
Hello? Hey, Carrie. Who?

22
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:31,088
Yeah, she's right here.

23
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,568
Hey, honey.

24
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:39,605
- Dinner? No. We just rented a DVD.
<i>- Raging Bull.</i>

25
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:43,108
- We go out. I hate when you say that.
- I hate it when she says that.

26
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:47,044
- Okay, uh, do you want a, uh, merlot or cabernet?
- Oh, here we go.

27
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,308
Do you want something fruity
or full-bodied and do—

28
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:54,081
Okay. Okay. What— Californian, French,
Argentinean, Chilean, Australian, Span—

29
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,087
- Still at it?
- Okay, you don't have to yell.

30
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:03,455
<i>- Ohh!</i>
- Oh, my God. That is amazing.

31
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,759
Oh, my God. Carrie.

32
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:09,324
Do you believe this?
Ta-da!

33
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,271
I would like to say something.

34
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:20,643
To Carrie and Dereck
and their lovely friends.

35
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,786
Oh, my goodness.

36
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,187
I don't know what it means,
but it sounded beautiful.

37
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:34,590
- It's a fake accent. He's from Poughkeepsie.
<i>- God, he is adorable.</i>

38
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,685
I could eat him alive.
Do you think he's single?

39
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,993
- I don't think he plays on your team.
<i>- But he's overweight.</i>

40
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,466
And poofs are rarely beefy. I wrote a piece
about that in a magazine once.

41
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,127
- Did you?
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

42
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:47,036
Carrie, do you have
the new Liza Minnelli CD?

43
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:51,065
<i>- Mmm. Okay,</i>
<i>and scratch my last comment. Cheers.</i>
- Cheers.

44
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,375
How's that new campaign coming along?
Carrie tells me it's been brutal.

45
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:57,109
<i>- Oh, uh, more for you, yeah?</i>
- Yes.

46
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,583
- Red or white?
- I'll have red. Actually, I'll have white.

47
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:01,586
- Okay.
- You know, I'll have both.

48
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:04,452
- All right.
- Um, well, Julia Bartlett is not an easygoing client.

49
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:07,857
- She's the worst.
- If Carrie wasn't on the account,
I'd pull my hair out.

50
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,895
Oh, honey.

51
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,556
- Doesn't mean you're getting
a promotion before me.

52
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:16,329
- Ooh, you sneaky little bitch.
- So, um, what do you do?

53
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:19,371
I'm doing my, uh, surgical residency
at Mount Sinai Hospital...

54
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,237
with a specialty in, uh—
heart transplants.

55
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,742
- Oh, fabulous.
- Thanks.

56
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,507
And how long have
you two been together?

57
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,582
- Us two?
- Mm-hmm.

58
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,586
Thirty years.

59
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:37,680
- I'm sorry. Did I miss something?
- Well, you're kidding, right?

60
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:40,817
- No.
- Gray's my sister.

61
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:43,123
Oh, my God!
No! Ick! No, I'm—

62
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:46,996
I just— I thought that you two were an item.
Well, I just—

63
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:50,160
- What? These-These two?
- Well, yeah. You seem so—

64
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,329
So?

65
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:55,533
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>So together, I guess.</i>

66
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,542
Hey, what'd I miss?

67
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:02,104
- Um, she thinks we're together.
<i>- Like "together"together?</i>

68
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,206
- Like screwing each other together.
- Ugh!

69
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:06,217
You're not the first one
to think that, Elaine.

70
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,219
- Let me tell you.
- What?

71
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,414
- They're very codependent.
- We are not!

72
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,015
- Come on.
- You rarely spend a minute apart. But if that's—

73
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,754
- We do too.
- All day at work, we never see each other.

74
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,420
How about that— Remember?

75
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,125
You want to know something? I've even seen
them share the same toothbrush.

76
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,861
- One time.
- Oh, ick.

77
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:28,305
- One time is— it's creepy.
- L— Listen.
I think that your relationship is charming.

78
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:30,569
- Thank you.
- Have you ever French-kissed?

79
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:34,545
<i>That's beautiful.</i>

80
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,606
- We're gonna end up like the Delany sisters.
- Who?

81
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,846
You know, the sisters that were 103 and 105,
and they never got married...

82
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,218
and they just did yoga and headstands
together every day.

83
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,348
That's what we should do.
Do headstands together.

84
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,358
Get the circulation flowing.
It'd be good for us.

85
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:51,692
- I'm serious. We need to venture out.
- To where? When?

86
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:54,028
I'm too busy to date,
and I'm not goin' to bars.

87
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,558
The giris there, all they do is they talk about
how fat they are. They're not fat.

88
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,969
They're not fat giris.
They're thin giris that think they're fat.

89
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:03,907
You know what I want? I want a girl who's not
afraid to eat a hot fudge sundae, okay...

90
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,467
and have no guilt attached,
that's what I want.

91
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,514
Can't you meet a cute intern
at the hospital?

92
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,674
Wrong. Can't do it. Too dangerous.

93
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,947
You can't have sexual tension
and cut an artery. It's awkward.

94
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,888
Okay, I'll look for a hot fudge sundae girl for you,
and you look for a guy for me...

95
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:21,085
- who is deep and sensitive and funny.
- Okay.

96
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,891
Someone who doesn't think Ginger Rogers
is one of the Spice Giris.

97
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:28,593
- Okay.
- Someone who wouldn't consider
going to Florida traveling.

98
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:32,263
- All right.
- Someone who's not afraid of Ethiopian food.

99
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,205
Somebody who doesn't think
Truffaut's a kind of mushroom.

100
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:40,074
Someone who would call me
an hour after our first date and say...

101
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:44,515
"I am crazy about you, and I'm counting
the minutes until I could see you again."

102
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,350
That's not gonna be easy, darlin'.

103
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,186
Ethiopian food, I-I like that.

104
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,919
Eatin' with your fingers, things.

105
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,294
It's quite festive.

106
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,306
Hey, Jimmy.
Happy birthday!

107
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,308
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi.

108
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:12,310
Oh, sorry about that.

109
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,676
Hey, Jenny, I promise I'll write my daytimes.
I totally forgot.

110
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,874
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry I'm late.

111
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,316
My Weight Watchers meeting went over,
and it was too good to leave.

112
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,980
Why do you still go to those meetings?
You have an awesome figure.

113
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:25,649
Oh, thanks.
Dereck thinks that I have flabby thighs.

114
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,250
He has nerve. He has a receding hairline.
Did you mention that to him?

115
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:31,524
- Did you tell him to go
to receding hairline meetings?
- Yeah, I know. Right?

116
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:36,193
But trust me. The entertainment factor alone
is worth it. Today, it was so crazy.

117
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:39,601
There was this woman who was all mad at
her husband for not letting her have dessert.

118
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:43,199
So she breaks into
the Soho Chocolate Factory...

119
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,869
and tried to drown herself
in a vat of chocolate.

120
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,435
<i>- No.</i>
- Yes.

121
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,038
- Like Augustus Gloop in <i>Willy Wonka?</i>
- Exactly.

122
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:52,482
It's like the cuckoo show.

123
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,849
Ooh, let's see
who's in Page Six today.

124
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,514
We need to focus.
I have a B-Pro presentation in three minutes...

125
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,218
with copy that's so pedestrian it sounds
like a crossing guard wrote it.

126
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,590
What happened to that cheerleading idea?
That was so good.

127
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,187
- It's so cool and kitsch. Kitsch is in.
- You think it was good?

128
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,391
I told Lana about it.
She said it was a big mistake.

129
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:10,629
- She says Julia Bartlett hates kitsch.
- Lana? Don't listen to Lana.

130
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:13,001
She's Mr. Phillips's secretary.
What does she know?

131
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:15,700
I do think she does a lot more
than just type for him.

132
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:20,109
- Give it up.
- Okay. You want to hear this?
I heard some hot gossip.

133
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:24,707
- Yeah.
- Lana—Wait, I feel like somebody's listening—

134
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:27,810
Lana goes to Kemiko,
my pedicurist...

135
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,856
and told her, who then told
Mrs. Karaquesh, my dry cleaner...

136
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:34,290
- she and Mr. Phillips have been
seeing each other for months.
- No!

137
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,227
I know it's accurate gossip
'cause Mrs. Karaquesh never gossips.

138
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,787
- Oh, my God!
- Ever.

139
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,891
- Hey, Lana!
- Hey!

140
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:45,732
Hey! What's up?
Do you want to have lunch with us today?

141
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:49,798
Oh, I'd love to, but Mr. Phillips asked me
to do some research for him, so—

142
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,605
<i>Oh, really?</i>
<i>Oh, that's too bad.</i>

143
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,236
- Maybe next week?
- Definitely.

144
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:58,113
- Okay.
- Bye.

145
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,652
Research my ass.

146
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,848
You mean her ass.

147
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,293
B- Pro.

148
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,304
The campaign—

149
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:23,705
Conrad, make sure the, uh, video system's on.
I want the whole company to hear this.

150
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:29,281
It's on, sir. Carry on, Gray.

151
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:33,216
The campaign exudes
nostalgia, comedy...

152
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:37,187
thrill, excitement and cutting-edge fashion
all under one banner.

153
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,692
It'll appeal to a wide demographic
and leads the consumer...

154
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,695
<i>with an emotional end benefit</i>
<i>of feeling charged up.</i>

155
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:48,325
To challenge themselves and seize the day
and be the best they can be.

156
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,300
Whoo!

157
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,666
Well, Julia?

158
00:12:56,742 --> 00:13:01,611
And I must say you look fantastic.

159
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,615
What do you think?
Great, no?

160
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,812
No.

161
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:11,482
- N-N-No?
- No.

162
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,090
<i>Well, it's, uh</i>—<i>it's</i>
<i>just an initial proposal.</i>

163
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,686
I mean, it still needs
to be tweaked and tuned.

164
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:21,324
You only tweak or tune
if something has potential.

165
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:27,171
Uh, we'll, uh—we'll go back
to the drawing board then, that's all.

166
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:31,539
Why don't you call me when
you have something original to present?

167
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,170
Julia, I'm sure we have a bunch of—
Shut that thing off.

168
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:37,079
<i>I'm sure we have a bunch of things.</i>
<i>This is just one of them.</i>

169
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,812
What's wrong with you? That was crap.
J- Julia, just a second.

170
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:47,253
I don't know, Sydney. I don't know
if this kind of therapy is working for me.

171
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,227
How come every road I take
turns out to be a dead end?

172
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,230
Why couldn't it be a fork?
I like forks.

173
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:55,324
At least with a fork there's a choice—
right or left or east or west...

174
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,562
- or this way or that way.
- Mm-hmm.

175
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:01,367
Why do you think you always reach
these dead ends?

176
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,035
Ooh! You see, gutter ball.
That's my life— a bunch of gutter balls.

177
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,135
Well, this is a perfect example...

178
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:10,944
of why having therapy in different locations
is so important.

179
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,382
Look at the deep symbolism
in that gutter ball.

180
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,716
No, this is good.

181
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,018
This is very, very good.

182
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:28,895
Can you think of one word
that best describes...

183
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:32,404
- the way your work situation makes you feel?
- Can I have two?

184
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:36,498
- No, one.
- Um—

185
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:42,437
Ohh!
Frustrated.

186
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,505
- You're up.
- Right.

187
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,746
Okay, another word...

188
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,348
for how you really feel
when your brother wins all your races.

189
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,054
- Frustrated.
- Okay.

190
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:03,829
Another word for how you feel
when you think about going on a date.

191
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:09,467
- Closed for repairs.
- That's not one word.

192
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,975
I know.
But I can't help it.

193
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:17,880
It's a weird thing,
but I see myself as this charming hotel...

194
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:23,217
that's beautifully romantic
and... wonderful on the outside...

195
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:25,950
but on the inside, it just
needs a ton of renovations.

196
00:15:26,024 --> 00:15:28,015
Hence, closed for repairs.

197
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,519
Nice analogy.

198
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,459
What kinds of renovations?

199
00:15:37,669 --> 00:15:40,661
Getting a promotion at work,
perfecting the tango...

200
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:44,402
disowning my mother,
getting liposuction under my chin.

201
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:47,070
There's nothing worse than chin fat.

202
00:15:47,145 --> 00:15:51,844
Uh, I think you need to...

203
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:55,910
let the idea of sharing your life
with someone other than your brother...

204
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,684
enter your consciousness.

205
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:01,749
But how can I be conscious of something
that I'm unconscious of?

206
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:06,321
It's not like I don't date. I've had plenty
of boyfriends. Maybe I'm just in a dry spell.

207
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,332
Let's try something.

208
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,563
How about keeping
the hotel closed...

209
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:15,073
but keeping the veranda
open for cocktails?

210
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:20,438
Well, I really like verandas.
I love trellises, and I love arboretums.

211
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,503
Aren't arboretums beautiful?
And houses with the porch out front—

212
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,015
Hold that thought.
'Cause we are out of time today...

213
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:29,281
but we will resume this conversation
next week at the rock climbing wall.

214
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:31,686
Nice game.

215
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,625
And what happened to
going to a movie?

216
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,856
How are you going to meet anyone
in a dark movie theater?

217
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,898
How are you going to meet
anyone at a dog park?

218
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:42,900
Hello? The dog park
is a vortex for singles.

219
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,902
Hello? When did we
become dog owners?

220
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,961
No.

221
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,977
I wash my hand of this whole fiasco.
You're on your own. Ow! Grabbing.

222
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:58,039
- Check out center field.
- What about cen—Ahh!

223
00:16:58,116 --> 00:17:00,914
Yes!

224
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,920
Holy... smokes.

225
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,582
I'll do the preinterview.
If she's great, uh, I'll scream, "Get the ball!"

226
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:08,057
- And you casually swing over to close.
- "Get the ball."

227
00:17:08,126 --> 00:17:10,594
<i>- What?</i>
<i>- There's no way she's single.</i>

228
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:13,062
- Do what I say.
- You know what? Don't get bossy.

229
00:17:13,131 --> 00:17:16,828
- Ow! Ohh.
- Try not to get hurt. Spazzy men are not attractive.

230
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:19,632
Some spazzy men are attractive.

231
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,369
- Gosh. You're so beautiful.
- Thank you.

232
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,968
- How old is she?
- She just turned three in September.

233
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:29,513
- Or should I say 21?
- She's legal.

234
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:32,243
Yeah. I suppose
I should buy her her first cocktail, huh?

235
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:35,616
<i>Maybe a liver martini</i>
<i>with a beefjerky twist?</i>

236
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,450
- I'm Charlie.
- Hi.

237
00:17:37,522 --> 00:17:41,481
<i>Originally Charlotte, but it always seemed</i>
<i>too long and never quite suited me, so—</i>

238
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,654
I'm Gray. You can't really shorten that
or it'd be "Gra."

239
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,028
- Nice to meet you.
<i>- Nice to meet you.</i>

240
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,158
- Do you like old movies?
- Yeah.

241
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,668
- Dancing? Are you athletic?
- Uh—

242
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,637
- Do you watch the Discovery Channel?
- Well—

243
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:55,764
<i>Do you have a boyfriend?</i>
<i>What is your favorite dessert?</i>

244
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,469
Okay. Um, uh—

245
00:17:58,543 --> 00:18:01,205
Let's see.
I'm a 1940s movie buff.

246
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:03,304
<i>I love to swing dance.</i>

247
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:05,315
I've never been
very good at sports...

248
00:18:05,383 --> 00:18:08,875
um, love the Discovery Channel,
"nix-ay" on the boyfriend...

249
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,388
<i>and, well, it's kind of a toss-up.</i>

250
00:18:11,456 --> 00:18:13,947
I- I like cheesecake,
but I kind of love...

251
00:18:14,025 --> 00:18:18,621
those big, gooey
hot fudge sundaes, so—

252
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,722
Get the ball.

253
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:39,879
Who's that? Look at him!
Oh, you're so cute. What's his name?

254
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:42,511
- Fluffy.
- Suki.

255
00:18:42,587 --> 00:18:46,045
Fluffy is his first name.
Suki is his pedestrian middle name.

256
00:18:46,124 --> 00:18:48,058
Oh, well, you are so adorable.

257
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:50,151
- How old is he?
- He's five.
- One.

258
00:18:50,228 --> 00:18:52,753
<i>He's one</i>— <i>He's one-five. He's 15.</i>

259
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,765
- This is my brother, Sam.
- Sam.

260
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,563
Sam.

261
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,366
- My sea otter's name is Sam.
- Is your sea otter's name Sam?

262
00:19:00,438 --> 00:19:02,497
- Yes.
- Don't tell me you're one of those people...

263
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:04,769
that illegally keeps endangered animals
in their apartment, like that guy...

264
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,572
that got caught with
a leopard in his kitchen?

265
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,910
No. I'm a zoologist.
I'm doing an internship at New York Aquarium.

266
00:19:09,981 --> 00:19:13,212
- Ha! That's a relief.
<i>- Free Willy</i> is my favorite movie.

267
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:16,777
<i>Well,</i> Free Willy 1, 2 <i>and</i> 3.
<i>It's hard to pick a favorite.</i>

268
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,789
And <i>Jaws.</i>
<i>Finding Nemo.</i>

269
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,189
Orca. Orca <i>not so much.</i>

270
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:24,751
- Do you live around here?
- Uh, sort of, yeah.

271
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,889
I'm staying on
a friend's sofa for right now.

272
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,263
I just moved here from San Francisco
about three weeks ago.

273
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:33,361
- I love San Francisco.
- Really? Have you spent much time there?

274
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,372
- Have I?
- You've never been to San Francisco.

275
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,238
I know I've never been to San Francisco,
but I know I would love it.

276
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,473
<i>Tony Bennett loves it. He left his heart there.</i>
<i>I love Tony Bennett. There you go.</i>

277
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:46,282
I have to go home for dinner.
Can I have Flicker back?

278
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,616
Yeah. You can have Flicker Fluffy Suki back.
That's the neighbor's dog.

279
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,816
We just walk him while he takes piano lessons,
'cause we love that dog.

280
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:55,587
- He's a budding pianist.
- That's so funny. Gypsy's not mine either.

281
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,594
I dog walk on the side
for extra cash.

282
00:19:57,662 --> 00:20:00,256
I should probably
get her back, so—

283
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,957
Oh.

284
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:06,003
It was really nice to meet you both.

285
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:08,437
- Nice meeting you both—You.
- Nice meeting you.

286
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,939
- What are you waiting for?
- What?

287
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:16,242
- She's leaving.
- I see she's leaving.

288
00:20:16,314 --> 00:20:19,078
All right.
Uh, excuse me!

289
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,745
<i>Since you're new in town, if you're not doing</i>
<i>anything tonight, maybe you'djoin us?</i>

290
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:25,847
<i>We're going out for tapas and bad Spanish wine,</i>
<i>if you'd like tojoin us.</i>

291
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:28,358
I just said that.
Would you like to join us? Three times.

292
00:20:28,426 --> 00:20:32,157
- Yeah, I'd love to.
- Okay.

293
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,633
<i>¡: Perfecto!</i>

294
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,045
<i>R- R-R-ico.</i>
R- R-R-R-R.

295
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,181
<i>R- R-R-R-R-R-Rico.</i>

296
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:15,338
Oh, easy, Pancho Villa.
These giris are <i>conmigo.</i> More <i>vino, por favor.</i>

297
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:18,638
<i>- ¡Ayayay, oh!</i>

298
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,304
<i>Gracias. Gracias.</i>

299
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:55,575
Carlos! Cover me!

300
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,672
I'm goin' in.

301
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,993
Okay, best food movie.

302
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:50,228
<i>- Like Water For Chocolate.</i>
<i>- Babette's Feast.</i> How about <i>Babette's Feast?</i>

303
00:22:50,301 --> 00:22:52,769
- Okay.
- Okay, <i>Fatso</i> starring Dom DeLuise.

304
00:22:52,837 --> 00:22:54,896
- Yes.
- Oh, good one. Okay, is it me?

305
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:57,168
Let's see.
Uh, women you need to get away from.

306
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:59,472
Bette Davis in
<i>What Ever Happened To Baby Jane?</i>

307
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:02,411
Ah, good one. I got Glenn Close in
<i>Fatal Attraction</i> for the rabbit.

308
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,746
- Kathy Bates in <i>Misery.</i>
- Okay. Okay. How 'bout, um, best screen kiss?

309
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:10,754
- Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh
in <i>Gone with the Wind.</i>
- That's overrated, I think.

310
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:14,019
I'll go with Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman
in <i>Notorious.</i>

311
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:16,083
Okay. I'll see your <i>Notorious...</i>

312
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:19,358
and I'll raise you Omar Sharif and Julie Christie
in <i>Doctor Zhivago.</i>

313
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,626
- Very good.
- Oh, wait. I'll see your <i>Doctor Zhivago...</i>

314
00:23:21,699 --> 00:23:24,759
and I will raise you Lady and the Tramp
in <i>Lady and the Tramp.</i>

315
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:27,703
Winner. Winner. The spaghetti pooch smooch.
Nothing better.

316
00:23:27,772 --> 00:23:31,139
Thank God we're home. My toes
are even starting to swell. I'm exhausted.

317
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:33,609
Dogs are barking? No wonder.
It's 4:30 in the morning.

318
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,646
Oh, my God.
I have to be up in three hours.

319
00:23:35,713 --> 00:23:38,580
I'm wide awake. I could go for hours.
I guess I'm nocturnal.

320
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,551
- Oh, yeah? Me too. You should get to bed.
How about a nightcap?
- Great.

321
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:43,644
What the hell.
I haven't pulled an all-nighter in ages.

322
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:47,316
<i>Let's go to Soho House or Sway</i>
<i>or like a diner or something.</i>

323
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:50,224
Ow.

324
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:53,355
- Don't you have that big meeting in the morning?
- What big meeting?

325
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,763
Big meeting in the morning
you have to get to?

326
00:23:55,834 --> 00:24:00,168
Oh, that big meeting.
Actually, I'm pretty tired. I should go to bed.

327
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:03,002
- It was great meeting you, Charlie.
- Okay. Good night.

328
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:05,065
I hope we can do this again.

329
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:07,634
Me too.
I'm getting my keys, all right?

330
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,703
- Straight to bed.
- Good night.

331
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,409
Night.

332
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:31,790
- Hey.
- Hey.

333
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:36,095
- You got in late last night.
I didn't even hear you come in.
- I'm just getting in now.

334
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:39,466
- Sounds like you had a good time.
- It was more than good.

335
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:41,903
- She's pretty great.
- She's more than great.

336
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:45,101
Don't blow it. You're off to a strong start,
but a girl can sense a "glommer."

337
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:48,907
- She doesn't think I'm a glommer.
- She could and you don't even know it.

338
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,438
- She doesn't think I'm a glommer.
- Staring in her eyes. Glommer.

339
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:55,315
- I know. I— Read my non-glomming lips.
- A girl doesn't like a guy—

340
00:25:55,386 --> 00:25:58,150
- I know she doesn't—
- She could think you're a glommer
and you don't know.

341
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,987
You know how I know?
Because I asked her to marry me.

342
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,686
What?

343
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,024
And she said yes.

344
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:07,030
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

345
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:09,965
<i>We got our blood work done this morning,</i>
<i>and we're going to Vegas this weekend...</i>

346
00:26:10,034 --> 00:26:13,970
- and we want you to be our witness.
- What?

347
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:17,940
I know. It's amazing.
It's like— It's-It's-It's— It's incredible.

348
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:21,706
You know what she is? She's— She's the sun,
she's the stars, she's the moon.

349
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:23,713
She's the jackpot. She's it.

350
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:26,841
You don't even know her.
She could be an ax murderer for all you know.

351
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:30,285
Oh, no!
I forgot to ask her if she was an ax murderer.

352
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:33,483
You know what she isn't? An ax murderer.
You know what she is? Perfect.

353
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:36,686
<i>She's perfect. Gray, remember what Mom</i>
<i>always used to say?</i>

354
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:40,026
When it was right, we would know.
Well, trust me. It's right.

355
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:43,499
Mom is divorced for the third time,
and she lives in a commune.

356
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:47,060
- Stop being so "J" and start being happy for me.
- I am so not "J."

357
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:50,335
<i>I'm notjealous of you when you're totally</i>
<i>psychologically unstable.</i>

358
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:53,172
I'm psychologically unstable? I'm psyc—
You're the one that said "Get the ball."

359
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:55,405
I said "Get the ball,"
not "Get the ring."

360
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,074
Gray, we're goin' to Vegas this weekend,
and we are gonna get married.

361
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:01,550
<i>You can come with us.</i>
<i>I booked you a room. I booked you a flight.</i>

362
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:03,951
If you come, great.
And if you don't, that's your deal.

363
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:07,549
- But you know what? I'm gettin' married.
- How does that happen?

364
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,889
One minute you know someone,
the next minute they're so desperate...

365
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,589
- they propose to someone they met 24 hours ago.
- Oh, hey, Gray Ghost.

366
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:16,566
I told Charlie that you'd meet her
at Bloomingdale's tomorrow
to try on wedding dresses.

367
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:20,502
She doesn't have a lot of friends in the city,
and I thought it'd be fun for you two.

368
00:27:20,571 --> 00:27:23,540
Forget it.
There's no way that's happening.

369
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:27,372
It's too frilly.
Something with a little less piff and poof.

370
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:31,211
Yeah, I think you're right.
Maybe something a little sexier.

371
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:34,308
If you want sexy, I got sexy.

372
00:27:34,385 --> 00:27:38,685
I mean, I know you kids aren't Little Bo Peep
underneath those dresses.

373
00:27:38,756 --> 00:27:41,190
But...

374
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:45,924
<i>if you ask me...</i>

375
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:50,331
a sexy bride just doesn't sit right.

376
00:27:50,401 --> 00:27:52,961
A beautiful bride, yes.

377
00:27:53,037 --> 00:27:55,562
<i>A glowing bride, of course.</i>

378
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,234
<i>But sexy is</i>— <i>l</i>—

379
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:00,709
I just don't know.

380
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:05,078
Personally, it makes me
a little uncomfortable.

381
00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:08,141
Really? Do you have anything in red
with a slit up to the hip?

382
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,585
- Red!
- She's kidding.

383
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:13,089
Just something with a little less piff and poof
and no lace.

384
00:28:13,157 --> 00:28:15,648
Oh, no lace?
No problem.

385
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:18,821
I will be right back.
I just got in a Dior in duchess satin...

386
00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:21,057
<i>that is to die for.</i>

387
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,362
Great.

388
00:28:24,535 --> 00:28:26,594
Are you sure you want to
go through with this?

389
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:29,970
Did you know that Sam
cheats at Monopoly and he snores?

390
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,635
- And he's got a hairy back.
- I work with animals.

391
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,769
Hairy is a turn-on.

392
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:39,374
Honestly? I was a goner the moment I saw him
at the dog park.

393
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:43,853
<i>There's just something about his impish smile</i>
<i>and that twinkle in his eye.</i>

394
00:28:43,921 --> 00:28:45,786
The smile isn't real.
His teeth are capped.

395
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:48,291
And the twinkle in his eyes?
It's a reflection off his contacts.

396
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:52,125
- He's as blind as a bat.
- Help me out of this thing.
My breasts feel like prisoners.

397
00:28:52,196 --> 00:28:54,391
Set them free.

398
00:28:58,035 --> 00:29:00,629
Please tell me you don't
wear stuff like that every day.

399
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:03,868
What? Lingerie?
I love it.

400
00:29:03,941 --> 00:29:06,307
I've spent more on lingerie
than I have on rent.

401
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:08,811
I haven't bought a new pair
of underwear in over four years.

402
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:14,145
- Eww. That's kind of gross, huh?
- Why don't you try a dress on?

403
00:29:14,218 --> 00:29:17,676
- No.
- Come on. This one's only 10,000.

404
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:20,280
No way, no way. Not doin' it.
Never gonna happen.

405
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:23,191
Come on. It will be fun.
Try it on.

406
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:28,289
Forget about it. No way. Never happening.
Not gonna... ever happen.

407
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:31,824
No!
What if I damage it?

408
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:34,838
Shh. Stay still while
I get this zipper up.

409
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,970
Ohh!

410
00:29:45,883 --> 00:29:48,477
Did you cover me? I was at
the Bloomingdale's bridal salon.

411
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:51,181
- Mr. Phillips came by at 9:30.
- He did?

412
00:29:51,255 --> 00:29:55,385
Yep. But I told him you were at the
gynecologist getting a pap smear. It shut him up.

413
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,861
- Good one.
- So what were you doing at
the Bloomingdale's bridal salon?

414
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,660
- You know that girl Sam met at the park?
- Don't tell me she's a man.

415
00:30:01,732 --> 00:30:04,599
- No!
- Sorry. I've been reading too
many trashy magazines. What?

416
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:07,502
He asked her to marry him,
and she said yes.

417
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:10,405
- No.
- Yes! The wedding is this weekend.

418
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,909
- No!
- Yes!
- Come on.

419
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:16,003
The worst thing is, I can't think of a reason
why he shouldn't marry her.

420
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,572
She's smart. She's beautiful.
She's funny. She's amazing.

421
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:23,518
Oh, please! She's a gold-digging
wench trying to hook her little
claws into a resident surgeon...

422
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:26,955
<i>before he makes the big bucks</i>
<i>that she can later get her hands on...</i>

423
00:30:27,024 --> 00:30:30,391
in an ugly, ugly, <i>ugly</i>
divorce settlement...

424
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:33,396
that her lawyer, who she's probably schtupping
on the side, will handle.

425
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:35,364
You're not still taping
<i>All My Children</i> every day?

426
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:39,426
I TiVo it. But seriously, you must be flipping out
that Sam is getting married...

427
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,098
<i>leaving you all alone,</i>
<i>completely single...</i>

428
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,107
<i>with no real prospects</i>
<i>in the future?</i>

429
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,702
<i>That's horrible.</i>
<i>I feel so bad for you.</i>

430
00:30:47,778 --> 00:30:51,305
Promise me if I ever call you when I'm suicidal,
you'll refer the call.

431
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:52,747
Sure.

432
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:59,248
Here you go. Can I get some change?
Kidding.

433
00:30:59,323 --> 00:31:01,985
Don't spend it all
on the slots. Red 21.

434
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:06,824
This place is—This is awesome.

435
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:09,298
Check this out. This is nuts.
What are these, satin sheets?

436
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:12,859
It's a satin-cotton blend. Possibly Egyptian
cotton if this is the high-roller room.

437
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:14,871
- Hello?
- Don't get excited.

438
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:18,238
'Cause you're not doin' any high rollin'
in this bed till tomorrow.

439
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:20,038
- Says who?
- Oh, says tradition.

440
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:22,238
You're not supposed to see the bride
until tomorrow morning.

441
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:25,942
- Where am I gonna stay?
- In the dinky room down the hall
that you booked for me.

442
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:28,713
- I'm not staying in a dinky room down the hall.
- Don't be mad, sweetie.

443
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:30,720
- What?
- I think some tradition is important.

444
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:32,779
Besides, we haven't been apart
in six whole days.

445
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:36,521
It'll be fun.
We can miss each other.

446
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:39,688
- Yeah, all right.
- Hi.

447
00:31:39,764 --> 00:31:42,198
What are you guys—
What are you guys gonna do without me?

448
00:31:42,266 --> 00:31:44,700
- None of your business. See you at the chapel.
- Ow! Violent.

449
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:48,535
You're gonna get socked.
Ow! Ow!

450
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:52,269
- You're gonna get a half nelson.
- Ohh.

451
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:55,744
- Ninja claw! Ohh!
- Hey!

452
00:31:57,214 --> 00:32:00,206
Did you see the bathroom?
It's insane. We have to take a bath.

453
00:32:00,284 --> 00:32:03,014
- Okay, I'll pour the bubbles, you order the bubbly.
- Okay.

454
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,716
- Let's get toasted!
- I can't get too drunk.
I am getting married in the morning.

455
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:10,283
- Exactly.
- Right. I'll order two bottles.

456
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:18,995
Ta-da!

457
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:23,029
I hope you didn't greet
the room service guy like that.

458
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:27,237
Hmm. Is that why he said
he didn't need a tip?

459
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:29,370
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

460
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:33,815
Please tell me you work out
three hours a day and eat like a gerbil.

461
00:32:33,884 --> 00:32:36,853
- Never been to a gym,
and I'm a macaroni and cheese addict.
- I hate you.

462
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:40,379
If I told you I had acne until I was 21,
would that make you feel better?

463
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,756
- A little.
- Mm-hmm. My nickname was "Connect the Dots."

464
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:49,562
I have a toast. To my soon-to-be
sister-in-law and my newfound friend—

465
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,933
That's a bathing suit you're wearing?
You're not embarrassed, are you?

466
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:58,271
Zits or no zits, my ass hasn't looked that good
since I was 17. I'm not taking off a thing.

467
00:32:58,342 --> 00:33:02,073
- I have a secret I want to share,
but I don't know if I should.
- You should.

468
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,512
- You can't tell Sam.
- Scout's honor.

469
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:08,541
Though I did get kicked out of the Brownies
for stealing money out of my cookie account.

470
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,814
Sam and I haven't had relations yet.

471
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:13,015
"Relations"?
Relations means my Aunt Betty.

472
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,388
Relations as in intercourse.

473
00:33:15,459 --> 00:33:18,223
I decided to wait,
and I don't know if that was a mistake.

474
00:33:18,295 --> 00:33:21,162
I mean, what if he's too big
or if I'm too small or—

475
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:25,362
T.M.I. Hasn't anyone ever told you
to test drive a car before you buy it?

476
00:33:36,313 --> 00:33:39,874
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

477
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,918
Thank you very much.
Well...

478
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:45,422
I love Vegas,
and I am certain that Vegas loves me...

479
00:33:45,489 --> 00:33:47,753
because I lost a bundle
on the slots last night.

480
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:51,261
- Is this five or six?
- I don't know. I lost count.
But I think I'm gonna be sick.

481
00:33:51,328 --> 00:33:54,058
- No, you're not. We're just getting warmed up.
- Oh, geez.

482
00:33:54,131 --> 00:33:59,899
<i>For my next number, I'd like to give</i>
<i>a warm welcome to my surprise guest</i>—

483
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:04,066
the delightful and charming
Miss Charlie Kelsey.

484
00:34:04,141 --> 00:34:06,166
Yeah!

485
00:34:06,243 --> 00:34:07,972
- You didn't.
- Did.

486
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:09,137
- You didn't!
- Did.

487
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,305
- Why?
- Ooh!

488
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:18,679
Come on, honey.
How are you feeling this evening, Charlie?

489
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:20,747
Like I could throw up at any minute.

490
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:23,419
<i>Well, that doesn't</i>
<i>sound too pleasant.</i>

491
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:26,657
I'm sorry. I didn't mean because of you.
I— Can I just sit down, please?

492
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:30,667
Not too fast. Not too fast.
Somebody has gone through a lot of trouble...

493
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,135
<i>to hear you sing a number</i>
<i>with me tonight.</i>

494
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:35,536
#Twelve #
There, I sang a number. I'm going home.

495
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:38,336
<i>Come on, girlfriend. I think we can do this.</i>

496
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:42,607
We can do this. We can do this.
Come on. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

497
00:36:19,376 --> 00:36:21,844
I can't believe I lost
that much money. Don't tell Sam.

498
00:36:21,912 --> 00:36:23,641
- He liked you too.
- Why did that—

499
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:27,480
- He kept buying me drinks.
- Hey!

500
00:36:27,551 --> 00:36:30,247
Somebody's got my purse.
Somebody's stealing it.

501
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:36,957
Ah. My wedding shoes.

502
00:36:37,027 --> 00:36:39,495
- I had a good time tonight.
- Me too.

503
00:36:42,132 --> 00:36:44,566
You can't go to sleep like that.
You got to get undressed.

504
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:47,433
- Can't.
- Oh, God.

505
00:36:47,504 --> 00:36:50,371
- All right. I'll help you.
- Mmm!

506
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:52,602
Sleeping.

507
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:05,720
Oh. Here.
Here's a shirt.

508
00:37:05,789 --> 00:37:08,417
Do you think the woman was mad...

509
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:12,622
when I asked to see her
husband's tattoo on his tush?

510
00:37:12,696 --> 00:37:16,063
Hmm?
It wasn't pretty.

511
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:20,763
I still don't know
if it was a ship or a— a bunny.

512
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:25,934
Did I tell you how happy I am
you're gonna be my sister-in-law?

513
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,502
- About 17 times.
- Well, I mean it.

514
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:10,550
Oh, my God.

515
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:14,318
Oh, my God!

516
00:38:14,391 --> 00:38:17,656
Oh, my God!

517
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:21,960
Oh, my God.

518
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:30,166
I can't believe that just happened.

519
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,872
How can this be happening? You're marrying
my brother tomorrow, for God's sake.

520
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:40,246
Oh, this can't be happening.

521
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:43,946
This is just a mistake. A meaningless,
too-much-tequila mistake.

522
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:53,061
Oh, my God!

523
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:06,040
- God, you're up early.
- Up would mean that I've been down.

524
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:09,170
You're already dressed?

525
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:13,012
I have a wicked headache.
Can we order some coffee?

526
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:15,017
Don't you think we should talk?

527
00:39:15,085 --> 00:39:17,986
Okay. Can we talk while I get ready?

528
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:20,489
- Yeah. Sure. I guess.
- Great.

529
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,727
I can't believe I'm getting married today.
I'm not even nervous.

530
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:28,822
Good. 'Cause I'm freakin' out.

531
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:32,164
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
I can be so insensitive sometimes.

532
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:34,295
- Are you really upset?
- Yeah.

533
00:39:34,371 --> 00:39:37,169
I would be too if it were my brother.
I'd be freakin' out.

534
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,709
Well, I'm past freaking out.
I'm molting.

535
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:41,802
I know it was one of those crazy,
spontaneous moments...

536
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,813
but don't you feel weird at all?

537
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,906
Not really. I mean,
I know it may seem strange...

538
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:48,645
- but the whole thing feels really natural.
- Natural?

539
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,552
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't feel natural. I feel subnatural.

540
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:54,386
In fact, I feel like E.T. I wanna phone home.

541
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:57,256
But if I phone home, Sam would answer,
and that wouldn't be good.

542
00:39:57,327 --> 00:40:00,626
- Yeah, you were just taken by surprise.
- Surprise?

543
00:40:00,697 --> 00:40:03,461
Gray, come on. Sit down.

544
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:07,095
- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.

545
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:09,833
Anyone would tell you
the exact same thing.

546
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:15,368
It is 100% normal to be feeling upset,
sad, freaked out.

547
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:17,607
In fact, considering everything...

548
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:20,081
I think you're handling
the whole thing really well.

549
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,311
- Really?
- Absolutely.

550
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:24,320
Your brother is getting married...

551
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:27,357
and deep down inside you feel
like you're losing him.

552
00:40:27,424 --> 00:40:29,415
That's why you think
I'm freaking out?

553
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:31,893
You think I'm having
separation anxiety?

554
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:47,206
There's only one thing that
can keep a marriage together...

555
00:40:47,277 --> 00:40:50,769
<i>and that is love.</i>

556
00:40:58,655 --> 00:41:00,213
Oh.

557
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:03,487
<i>As the lucky messenger</i>
<i>of our Lord and Savior above...</i>

558
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:07,257
I look to the two of you
with your bright smiles of devotion...

559
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:11,995
and promise of commitment
here in the very house of the Lord above!

560
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:27,074
- This place is nuts.
<i>- But before I continue, I must ask...</i>

561
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:31,019
if there's anybody here
who has any objection whatsoever...

562
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:33,352
to the union of these two lovebirds.

563
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:37,757
I'm sorry. Carry on.
Go ahead.

564
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,762
<i>As I was saying...</i>

565
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,924
if there's anybody here
who has an objection to the union...

566
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,367
of these two love angels,
speak their piece now.

567
00:41:51,341 --> 00:41:53,673
Oh, my God! Look out!

568
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:58,140
Your hiccups gone?

569
00:41:58,215 --> 00:42:01,309
- Actually, yes.
- Good. Great.

570
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,376
Carry on, Minister.
No one objects.

571
00:42:03,453 --> 00:42:06,286
- Right?
- Right.

572
00:42:06,356 --> 00:42:11,487
<i>Then by the power vested in me</i>
<i>by the glorious state of Nevada...</i>

573
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:15,157
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

574
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:18,497
You may now kiss the bride, yeah.

575
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,636
Hi. I'd like a hot dog with kraut on one side
and relish on the other...

576
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:57,105
with ketchup on the kraut and mustard
on the relish, but don't let the two touch.

577
00:43:16,693 --> 00:43:20,789
Sydney, I need to talk to you right away.
This is an emergency. Call me.

578
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:28,504
Now reach to your right.

579
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:32,142
Station your left leg
on the rock in the middle.

580
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:35,142
All right, Gray,
what's really going on?

581
00:43:35,211 --> 00:43:38,669
I canceled a session with someone today
because you said it was an emergency.

582
00:43:38,748 --> 00:43:40,409
- It is.
- Well, then?

583
00:43:40,483 --> 00:43:43,213
Take a deep breath—

584
00:43:43,286 --> 00:43:46,380
And tell me what's going on.

585
00:43:46,456 --> 00:43:50,620
Three short breaths, one long.
That's what Sam and I did when we were kids...

586
00:43:50,693 --> 00:43:54,993
- and there was something that
was difficult to talk about.
- Fine. Then do that.

587
00:44:00,637 --> 00:44:04,232
- I think I'm gay.
- What was that?

588
00:44:04,307 --> 00:44:08,710
- I can't say it again.
- Did you just say "I think I'm gay"?

589
00:44:08,778 --> 00:44:11,747
It's like this. For years,
I thought I was content being single...

590
00:44:11,814 --> 00:44:13,748
and I wasn't really
interested in a relationship.

591
00:44:13,816 --> 00:44:16,751
I thought that when Mr. Right
came into my life, he just would.

592
00:44:16,819 --> 00:44:19,845
<i>He</i>— <i>He wouldn't need some fancy invitation.</i>
<i>He wouldjust arrive.</i>

593
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:25,589
And then I realized that it's not Mr. Right
I'm waiting for. It's Mrs. Right.

594
00:44:25,662 --> 00:44:27,596
- Oh.
<i>- And I think I found her.</i>

595
00:44:27,664 --> 00:44:31,430
And I kissed her—

596
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:33,765
And I think she kissed me back,
but I'm not sure...

597
00:44:33,836 --> 00:44:37,101
'cause I never kissed a girl before,
and I'm not sure what the rules are.

598
00:44:37,173 --> 00:44:39,641
<i>But I know that I liked it.</i>

599
00:44:39,709 --> 00:44:43,236
And I think I like her.
Now I feel nauseous again.

600
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:45,247
<i>Why do you think you feel nauseous?</i>

601
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:49,911
Do you think you committed some terrible sin
just because you kissed a girl?

602
00:44:49,986 --> 00:44:53,149
<i>Why? If you're two consenting adults,</i>
<i>what's so terrible about that?</i>

603
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:55,623
Well, I don't know if she consented.
She was very drunk.

604
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:58,160
Oh, so you believe
you forced her to kiss you?

605
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:00,458
No. No, not at all.
She kissed me.

606
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:02,623
- Okay, I'm confused now.
<i>- So am I.</i>

607
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:05,862
Y- You don't know what it's like.
One day you think you're one thing...

608
00:45:05,935 --> 00:45:08,028
and the next day you realize
you're something else.

609
00:45:08,104 --> 00:45:10,129
I feel like I'm Dorothy in
<i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

610
00:45:10,206 --> 00:45:12,436
I'm in this new land
and I want to get home...

611
00:45:12,508 --> 00:45:14,976
but something is telling me
maybe this is my home.

612
00:45:15,044 --> 00:45:16,978
Maybe I shouldn't click
my heels three times.

613
00:45:17,046 --> 00:45:21,949
Maybe I should just stay here
and be nauseous with the Munchkins.

614
00:45:22,018 --> 00:45:24,680
What scares you most
about this whole thing?

615
00:45:28,024 --> 00:45:31,460
That I'll lose Sam and he'll
never talk to me again.

616
00:45:31,527 --> 00:45:33,620
Well, why would Sam even care?

617
00:45:33,696 --> 00:45:36,688
Call me crazy, but he might be a little upset
I kissed his wife.

618
00:45:36,766 --> 00:45:39,929
Whoa!

619
00:45:41,671 --> 00:45:44,401
- Are you all right?
- Oh, God.

620
00:45:44,474 --> 00:45:46,942
Y- You're looking pale.
Maybe you should take some deep breaths.

621
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:49,171
- I'm fine.
- Well, I'm not. I'm a wreck.

622
00:45:49,245 --> 00:45:51,509
I haven't slept in three days.
I've taken 42 showers.

623
00:45:51,581 --> 00:45:54,641
I've been to a church, a temple and a mosque,
begging for forgiveness.

624
00:45:54,717 --> 00:45:56,275
The Mormon place wouldn't let me in.

625
00:45:56,352 --> 00:45:58,980
I think we need to talk about this
on level ground.

626
00:45:59,055 --> 00:46:01,046
You're not thinking straight.

627
00:46:01,124 --> 00:46:04,321
- No kidding.
- We need to get down.

628
00:46:10,233 --> 00:46:12,394
- Listen to me.
- I'm listening.

629
00:46:12,468 --> 00:46:14,993
- You're not gay.
- I'm not?

630
00:46:15,071 --> 00:46:17,062
- No, you're not.
- How do you know?

631
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:20,041
- Because it's textbook.
- Insanity?

632
00:46:20,109 --> 00:46:22,976
No. What you did was normal.
It was almost predictable.

633
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:25,037
You were so jealous of Charlie...

634
00:46:25,114 --> 00:46:28,242
that you subconsciously tried
to sabotage Sam's marriage.

635
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:31,014
Read my lips.

636
00:46:31,087 --> 00:46:34,022
- You are not gay.
- I'm not?

637
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:35,682
- No, you're not.
- Are you sure?

638
00:46:35,758 --> 00:46:38,693
- Yes!
- Because my mind is reeling
with feelings and emotions...

639
00:46:38,761 --> 00:46:42,527
- and my heart's telling me—
- Actually, our time is up for today.

640
00:46:42,598 --> 00:46:47,262
Now, forget about Sam
and get out there and date.

641
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:51,501
Your hotel is open for business.
Got it?

642
00:46:51,574 --> 00:46:56,068
Now, I will see you next week
at the batting cages at Chelsea Piers.

643
00:46:56,145 --> 00:46:58,443
Nice climb.

644
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:06,210
My hotel is open. I have suites, junior suites,
deluxe accommodations available.

645
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:09,881
- Hey.
- Hey.

646
00:47:09,959 --> 00:47:11,927
- That's a great outfit.
- Thanks.

647
00:47:11,994 --> 00:47:14,622
You know, actually, my grandfather
once told me it's much nicer to say...

648
00:47:14,697 --> 00:47:17,291
"That outfit looks
very becoming on you."

649
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:19,801
Well, thanks to you and your pops.

650
00:47:19,869 --> 00:47:22,030
Whoa. That coffee smells great.

651
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:24,039
I'm on this no-caffeine kick
right now...

652
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:26,940
but I still find myself hanging around
Starbucks trying to get an aroma buzz.

653
00:47:27,009 --> 00:47:28,943
Actually, it's not all coffee.

654
00:47:29,011 --> 00:47:31,275
It's one-third coffee,
one-third cocoa, one-third chai...

655
00:47:31,347 --> 00:47:34,646
with a little bit of steamed soy and cinnamon
and a little bit of nutmeg.

656
00:47:34,717 --> 00:47:36,912
Wow. That's a new one.

657
00:47:38,988 --> 00:47:41,752
- What was that?
- Mmm— Nothing.

658
00:47:41,824 --> 00:47:45,089
Would you like to have dinner
with me tonight?

659
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:47,891
Wow. That—That took guts.

660
00:47:47,964 --> 00:47:49,989
Would you?

661
00:47:50,066 --> 00:47:52,000
Sure. What time?

662
00:47:52,068 --> 00:47:55,265
- Um, Raoul's at 10:00.
- All right. Well, I'll see you then.

663
00:47:55,338 --> 00:47:57,602
Great. Are you going up?

664
00:47:57,673 --> 00:48:00,301
- Down.
- Okay. See you tonight.

665
00:48:00,376 --> 00:48:04,142
- Oh!
- Are-Are you okay?

666
00:48:07,917 --> 00:48:10,750
- Is anything sprained? Broken?
Maybe we should call a doctor.
- I'm fine, thank you.

667
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,754
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

668
00:48:18,461 --> 00:48:20,452
Would you like to have dinner
with me tonight?

669
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,521
Say 8:00 at Raoul's?

670
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:29,567
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

671
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:31,971
Oh, well, you know,
I'm a pretty busy guy.

672
00:48:32,041 --> 00:48:34,236
I'm usually booked up every night.

673
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:36,574
I'd have to—
I'd have to check my schedule.

674
00:48:36,646 --> 00:48:40,207
- Yeah! Yeah, I think I can do that.
- Great.

675
00:48:40,283 --> 00:48:42,547
Cool.

676
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:48,522
Hey, Gray. Gray Ghost.
You need a little help?

677
00:48:48,591 --> 00:48:50,525
Oh, you did some serious— Oh!

678
00:48:50,593 --> 00:48:52,527
Damage.
Holy smokes.

679
00:48:52,595 --> 00:48:54,529
Look at you.
What's the occasion?

680
00:48:54,597 --> 00:48:56,656
- I got a couple of dates tonight.
- A couple?

681
00:48:56,732 --> 00:49:00,031
Yeah. I got a 8:00 dinner with one,
and I got a 10:00 dinner with the other.

682
00:49:00,102 --> 00:49:02,935
That's great. Did you get that rash
you always get before you go out?

683
00:49:03,005 --> 00:49:05,439
- No. Why did you remind me?
- Just trying to help.

684
00:49:05,508 --> 00:49:08,238
- Look, is now a good time to talk?
- About what?

685
00:49:08,311 --> 00:49:11,075
I wanted to check in, see when you thought
you might get your own place.

686
00:49:11,147 --> 00:49:13,911
<i>I know we get along great,</i>
<i>and Charlie loves you...</i>

687
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:16,543
but we are newlyweds so I thought you might—

688
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:19,315
Do you know how hard it is to find
a rent-controlled place in the city?

689
00:49:19,388 --> 00:49:21,322
Why do I have to be the one to move?

690
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:24,257
One, the lease is in my name,
and, two, I found the apartment.

691
00:49:24,327 --> 00:49:26,591
'Cause a 90-year-old woman
died on your shift at the hospital.

692
00:49:26,662 --> 00:49:29,529
Her body wasn't even cold before you were
calling the super, claiming to be her nephew.

693
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,397
I didn't hear you complaining.
As a matter of fact, you went to her funeral.

694
00:49:32,468 --> 00:49:35,301
That's 'cause I'm sensitive and not mean like you.
You can't kick me out.

695
00:49:35,371 --> 00:49:39,102
I decorated the whole apartment.
I even grouted the bathroom tiles myself.

696
00:49:39,175 --> 00:49:41,336
I'm just saying maybe
you should start looking, that's all.

697
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:43,571
- I hate you! I really do.
- Hey, hey! Hey!

698
00:49:43,646 --> 00:49:47,013
I can hear you guys yelling from around the block.
What's going on?

699
00:49:47,083 --> 00:49:49,779
- I wasn't yelling. She was yelling.
- I was. I hate him!

700
00:49:49,852 --> 00:49:52,013
- Why? What did he do now?
- Me?

701
00:49:52,088 --> 00:49:54,352
- That's a little presumptuous, don't you think?
- He's kicking me out.

702
00:49:54,423 --> 00:49:56,755
Sam, I thought we spoke about this.

703
00:49:56,826 --> 00:49:59,852
We'll get our own place
once I get a full-time position at the aquarium.

704
00:49:59,929 --> 00:50:02,898
<i>- Until then, it's fine. I actually kind oflike it.</i>
- You do?

705
00:50:02,965 --> 00:50:04,899
Yeah. It's fun.

706
00:50:04,967 --> 00:50:07,060
I love living with the both of you.

707
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:10,970
- What's wrong?
- Shit.

708
00:50:15,344 --> 00:50:17,278
She has a couple of dates tonight...

709
00:50:17,346 --> 00:50:20,213
- and her chest just broke out into hives.
- Oh.

710
00:50:30,526 --> 00:50:33,222
Hey. I think—
I don't know if you remember me...

711
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:37,232
- but I think you drove me before.
- Oh, you're not very fond of Florida...

712
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,461
and when you refer
to Ginger's companion...

713
00:50:39,535 --> 00:50:42,698
you're not talking
about sushi or wasabi.

714
00:50:42,772 --> 00:50:44,706
Not bad.

715
00:50:44,774 --> 00:50:46,969
- Where's that funny accent of yours from?
- Oh...

716
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:49,273
a funny place called Scotland.

717
00:50:49,345 --> 00:50:52,041
- What brings you to New York?
- Fame and fortune, of course.

718
00:50:52,114 --> 00:50:55,743
- Hmm. How's that goin'?
- Well, let's see.

719
00:50:55,818 --> 00:50:57,809
I've had two auditions so far.

720
00:50:57,887 --> 00:51:01,254
The first one was for the lead
in a tampon spot—

721
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:03,724
the role of the tampon,
of course—

722
00:51:03,793 --> 00:51:07,092
and then, uh, the second one
was a voice-over...

723
00:51:07,163 --> 00:51:09,961
for a pest-control infomercial.

724
00:51:10,032 --> 00:51:12,000
And I didn't get that part.

725
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:16,129
They, uh—They said that they thought roaches
didn't have accents.

726
00:51:16,205 --> 00:51:20,505
I begged to differ,
but I didn't want to seem argumentative.

727
00:51:20,576 --> 00:51:22,771
Hmm.

728
00:51:22,845 --> 00:51:25,939
Don't worry. I'm not contagious.

729
00:51:27,516 --> 00:51:30,952
- I'm not worried.
- What can I say? I am a mess.

730
00:51:32,321 --> 00:51:34,448
You don't look like a mess.

731
00:51:34,523 --> 00:51:36,650
You look as cute as a button.

732
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:38,853
And buttons aren't messy.

733
00:51:39,862 --> 00:51:42,160
Well, looks can be deceiving.

734
00:51:44,867 --> 00:51:47,802
You know, back home in Scotland,
I was captain of the local football team.

735
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:49,804
- Oh?
- Yeah.

736
00:51:49,872 --> 00:51:52,306
And all my mates used to come to me
with their problems.

737
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:54,309
They said I was pretty good.

738
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:56,470
So—

739
00:51:56,545 --> 00:51:59,912
I'm all ears if you want to talk to someone
from the outside, you know?

740
00:51:59,982 --> 00:52:04,419
Hmm. That's sweet, but it would take all night
to tackle my laundry list.

741
00:52:04,487 --> 00:52:06,421
Thanks.

742
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:09,524
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

743
00:52:13,162 --> 00:52:15,153
I'm crazy about you.

744
00:52:16,532 --> 00:52:18,864
And I'm counting the minutes
until I see you again.

745
00:52:18,934 --> 00:52:21,368
- Hey, that's my line.
<i>- I'm an actor.</i>

746
00:52:21,437 --> 00:52:23,405
We get paid to steal
other people's lines.

747
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:27,075
See ya.

748
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:30,078
Uh, seriously, though—

749
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:32,706
Could I give you
a lift home tonight?

750
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:36,741
<i>I could come and fetch you about, say,</i>
<i>just before midnight.</i>

751
00:52:36,819 --> 00:52:39,083
No charge.

752
00:52:40,656 --> 00:52:43,557
- Okay.
- Great.

753
00:52:59,875 --> 00:53:03,402
- Excuse me.
Can I get another double vodka martini?
- Sure.

754
00:53:03,479 --> 00:53:06,448
With three olives
and a tiny splash of vermouth.

755
00:53:06,515 --> 00:53:09,780
- Okay.
- And just a hint— a hint— of salt on the rim.

756
00:53:09,852 --> 00:53:12,753
- Yeah.
- A little water, please, also?

757
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:15,086
Of course.
Would you like to hear the specials?

758
00:53:15,157 --> 00:53:17,091
- Please.
- Yeah.
- Fantastic.

759
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:19,354
Tonight we have
a braised lamb shank...

760
00:53:19,428 --> 00:53:21,419
marinated in a rosemary-lime sauce.

761
00:53:21,497 --> 00:53:24,057
<i>That's served</i>
<i>with a creamed pumpkin squash.</i>

762
00:53:24,133 --> 00:53:26,101
We also have
a grilled halibut steak...

763
00:53:26,168 --> 00:53:28,636
<i>in a soy-tamari lemon-zest glaze.</i>

764
00:53:28,704 --> 00:53:32,435
And that comes with grilled seaweed
and an orange and almond salad.

765
00:53:32,508 --> 00:53:34,476
Do we know what we'd like?

766
00:53:34,543 --> 00:53:37,376
<i>Yes. I'll have the halibut with the pumpkin</i>
<i>squash and the rosemary-lime sauce...</i>

767
00:53:37,446 --> 00:53:39,505
and not the soy-tamari-lemon stuff.

768
00:53:39,582 --> 00:53:43,245
Oh, that does sound good, doesn't it?
Yeah, they don't come together.

769
00:53:43,319 --> 00:53:45,844
- Well, can you make 'em come together?
- I'll try.

770
00:53:45,921 --> 00:53:47,912
Try hard.
And I'll have the duck confit.

771
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:50,584
Excellent.
Coming right up.

772
00:53:50,659 --> 00:53:53,856
Conrad, I'm impressed. You duked the guy.
I didn't know you had it in you.

773
00:53:53,929 --> 00:53:56,124
<i>There's a lot in me</i>
<i>that you don't know about.</i>

774
00:53:56,198 --> 00:54:00,692
<i>I'm a burnin'sex machine</i>
<i>just waitin'to be used and abused by you.</i>

775
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:03,295
<i>The harder, the better.</i>

776
00:54:03,372 --> 00:54:05,704
Check, please.

777
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:10,178
...as much as I can,
but it's not good.

778
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:12,180
<i>- How?</i>
- I don't know.

779
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:14,716
So wait.
Let me just get this straight.

780
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:16,843
<i>So you love Capra...</i>

781
00:54:16,919 --> 00:54:18,819
you run in the park, you tango...

782
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:22,289
<i>you live for Italy,</i>
<i>and you hate asparagus.</i>

783
00:54:22,358 --> 00:54:24,519
Are you sure we weren't
separated at birth?

784
00:54:24,593 --> 00:54:27,460
- You don't play poker, do you?
- I've been playing with the same buddies...

785
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:29,464
every Thursday since I was 15.

786
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:31,523
I'm a five-card stud girl, myself.

787
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,693
Closed hand, deuces wild.

788
00:54:33,769 --> 00:54:36,329
I love it when you talk dirty.

789
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,865
This is actually fun.

790
00:54:39,942 --> 00:54:42,536
<i>I have to admit.</i>
<i>I usually dread the whole first-date thing.</i>

791
00:54:42,611 --> 00:54:44,841
You know, the awkward lulls
in the conversation.

792
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:47,815
<i>Then the anxious pain in the pit</i>
<i>of my stomach when I can't wait...</i>

793
00:54:47,883 --> 00:54:51,375
for the night to end,
but I'm feeling no pain, no lulls.

794
00:54:51,453 --> 00:54:54,422
Yeah, I'm feeling rather
painless and "lull-less" myself.

795
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:57,186
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.

796
00:55:01,463 --> 00:55:05,593
But, uh, I do want to be honest
with you about something.

797
00:55:05,668 --> 00:55:08,501
Oh, no. Honesty on the first date.
That has a bad ring to it.

798
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:13,599
See, I was so flattered with the way
you asked me out in the elevator.

799
00:55:13,676 --> 00:55:16,372
- I know. Don't tell me. You're married.
- Actually, I'm not married...

800
00:55:16,445 --> 00:55:19,278
but Stewart and I have been
living together for years.

801
00:55:20,816 --> 00:55:23,284
- Yeah.
<i>- Stewart</i>—

802
00:55:23,352 --> 00:55:26,253
- Am I a moron or what?
- Don't be so hard on yourself.

803
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:28,847
- I can't help it. I'm hopeless.
- You're not.

804
00:55:28,924 --> 00:55:31,620
- I'm a walking Dear Abby column.
- Hold on a minute, darling.

805
00:55:31,694 --> 00:55:34,595
All you need is some space...

806
00:55:34,663 --> 00:55:37,257
some fresh air and some perspective.

807
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:40,962
Fresh air, space and perspective
in New York City.

808
00:55:41,036 --> 00:55:43,800
Stick with me.

809
00:55:45,507 --> 00:55:47,839
<i>This is unbelievable.</i>

810
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:49,935
<i>Isn't this fantastic?</i>

811
00:55:50,012 --> 00:55:52,310
Yeah, it's one of the perks
of the job.

812
00:55:52,381 --> 00:55:54,508
I give Jimmy the doorman
free rides...

813
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:56,642
and he lets me come up here
whenever I fancy.

814
00:55:56,719 --> 00:55:59,153
I love this city.

815
00:55:59,221 --> 00:56:01,917
<i>Oh, me too.</i>

816
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:05,620
<i>You know, it's funny,</i>
<i>'cause sometimes, up here...</i>

817
00:56:05,694 --> 00:56:08,322
everything is so tall and grand.

818
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:11,424
Even my biggest problems,
you know...

819
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,128
suddenly seem very wee.

820
00:56:15,804 --> 00:56:21,401
Within seconds
they just melt away like tiny dewdrops.

821
00:56:21,477 --> 00:56:25,004
You're so sweet.
Thanks for cheering me up.

822
00:56:28,784 --> 00:56:31,082
Ah, it's my pleasure.

823
00:56:46,068 --> 00:56:49,094
Sorry. I couldn't resist.

824
00:56:49,171 --> 00:56:51,639
I've been wanting to do that...

825
00:56:51,707 --> 00:56:54,141
from the moment I saw your face
in my rearview mirror.

826
00:56:54,209 --> 00:56:57,079
<i>What's wrong?</i>

827
00:56:57,212 --> 00:57:00,375
Oh, Christ. Was it awful?
I- I'm a wee bit out of practice.

828
00:57:00,449 --> 00:57:03,145
No, it wasn't awful.
You're a really nice kisser.

829
00:57:03,218 --> 00:57:06,119
Well, thank you.

830
00:57:07,122 --> 00:57:09,056
Your lips seem...

831
00:57:09,124 --> 00:57:12,218
nice and supple too.

832
00:57:13,962 --> 00:57:16,396
<i>But I'm sensing that, uh</i>—

833
00:57:18,633 --> 00:57:22,797
Your heart's not doing
the Riverdance thing that mine is.

834
00:57:22,871 --> 00:57:24,862
Gordy, I'm sorry.

835
00:57:26,108 --> 00:57:28,542
- Oh.
- For what?

836
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:30,544
For being me.

837
00:57:30,612 --> 00:57:32,671
Ah, there's nothing wrong with that.

838
00:57:32,747 --> 00:57:35,409
I happen to think
you're pretty dandy.

839
00:57:43,992 --> 00:57:45,926
So you're gay.

840
00:57:45,994 --> 00:57:48,258
Big deal.

841
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:50,992
- How did you know?
- Just a feeling, I suppose.

842
00:57:52,567 --> 00:57:56,697
That and the fact that you haven't shut up
about Charlie all night.

843
00:57:58,907 --> 00:58:01,774
And every time you mentioned
her name you got that little...

844
00:58:02,777 --> 00:58:05,678
sparkle thing in your eyes.

845
00:58:08,383 --> 00:58:10,578
- What am I gonna do now?
- Ah.

846
00:58:10,652 --> 00:58:12,586
That's easy.

847
00:58:12,654 --> 00:58:14,588
You're gonna move on
with your life...

848
00:58:14,656 --> 00:58:16,590
start being the person
that you're supposed to be...

849
00:58:16,658 --> 00:58:20,059
instead of wasting your time
pretending to be someone that you're not.

850
00:58:20,128 --> 00:58:22,119
I mean, crikey.

851
00:58:22,197 --> 00:58:25,064
Are you not exhausted?

852
00:58:25,133 --> 00:58:27,966
I am, but it's so much easier
to keep pretending.

853
00:58:28,036 --> 00:58:32,097
Oh, but easy is so bloody boring!

854
00:58:33,341 --> 00:58:35,309
Isn't it?

855
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,916
As your newfound friend...

856
00:58:41,983 --> 00:58:45,612
I am prescribing a remedy for you.

857
00:58:49,491 --> 00:58:51,721
That's part of the remedy.

858
00:58:52,994 --> 00:58:54,985
This is the remedy.

859
00:58:56,198 --> 00:58:59,429
"I am woman. Hear me roar."

860
00:59:00,535 --> 00:59:03,766
Helen Reddy.
She'll sort you out.

861
00:59:17,419 --> 00:59:20,547
<i> There are a few things</i>
<i>I'd like to know about you too.</i>

862
00:59:20,622 --> 00:59:23,113
<i>All right. What would you like to know?</i>

863
00:59:23,191 --> 00:59:25,125
<i>Oh, just about anything.</i>

864
00:59:25,193 --> 00:59:27,388
<i>Things you like.</i>
<i>Things you don't like.</i>

865
00:59:27,462 --> 00:59:31,523
<i>Where you went to school. Who was your</i>
<i>first beau. What you want out oflife.</i>

866
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:35,331
<i>- Mmm. That's a tall order. Where shall I start?</i>
- Oh, my God.

867
00:59:35,403 --> 00:59:38,566
<i>- Till the Clouds Roll By.</i>
<i>- I guess I like what everyone likes.</i>

868
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,234
That's one of my favorite
all-time movies.

869
00:59:41,309 --> 00:59:43,436
I know every line and every step.

870
00:59:43,511 --> 00:59:45,775
Me too.

871
00:59:50,986 --> 00:59:53,580
- Will you dance with me?
- Oh, no, thank you. No.

872
00:59:53,655 --> 00:59:55,748
- Go ahead and dance with her.
- No, no, I can't.

873
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,094
Will you dance with me?

874
01:00:01,162 --> 01:00:04,222
I sure will, baby.
Watch this.

875
01:00:04,299 --> 01:00:06,494
- Do you know this dance?
- Yeah.

876
01:01:16,571 --> 01:01:18,732
What's goin' on?

877
01:01:18,807 --> 01:01:21,241
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

878
01:01:21,309 --> 01:01:23,539
I hate when you ask so many questions.
It's so annoying.

879
01:01:23,611 --> 01:01:25,602
Sorry. You okay?

880
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,945
- I'm fine.
- All I asked was, what's going on?

881
01:01:29,017 --> 01:01:32,544
Nothing. I'm going to bed, okay?
Got any questions you want to ask about that?

882
01:01:36,958 --> 01:01:39,392
She must be ovulating.

883
01:01:39,461 --> 01:01:41,929
I heard that. Huh?

884
01:01:45,033 --> 01:01:47,467
- How you doin'?
- How you doin'?

885
01:01:51,106 --> 01:01:53,336
Mmm. She's the best.

886
01:01:53,408 --> 01:01:56,741
Strong, independent, feisty.

887
01:01:56,811 --> 01:01:59,473
- Who are you talking about?
<i>- Who else? Queen Oprah.</i>

888
01:01:59,547 --> 01:02:03,005
Oprah. Oprah the Great.
Oprah— I love her.

889
01:02:03,084 --> 01:02:05,109
Do you understand
that I'm obsessed with her?

890
01:02:05,186 --> 01:02:08,280
Like, I think she is so great
that she should start her own religion.

891
01:02:08,356 --> 01:02:11,052
<i>I love her so much</i>
<i>that if she and Steadman...</i>

892
01:02:11,126 --> 01:02:13,151
couldn't have children
and needed a little bit of help...

893
01:02:13,228 --> 01:02:15,162
I would surrogate a child for them.

894
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:17,858
That's right, I would have Oprah's baby.
That's how much I love her.

895
01:02:17,932 --> 01:02:20,264
Wow. That's a lot of love.

896
01:02:20,335 --> 01:02:23,771
Last night I was so inspired after watching
her show about loving your body that—

897
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:25,772
- Do you know what I did today?
- What?

898
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:28,172
- I quit Weight Watchers.
- Get out!

899
01:02:28,243 --> 01:02:31,007
Yeah! Can you believe it?
I quit. Fergie, "smergie."

900
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:33,547
<i>I hate fiber.</i>
<i>I like Mallomars.</i>

901
01:02:33,615 --> 01:02:36,049
And if Dereck isn't going to love me
for the tiny amount...

902
01:02:36,117 --> 01:02:38,142
of cellulite I have
on the back of my thighs...

903
01:02:38,219 --> 01:02:41,655
- then fuck him— Screw that guy.
- Yeah.

904
01:02:41,723 --> 01:02:44,624
This is the package, okay?
It's exactly the same under the wrapping.

905
01:02:44,692 --> 01:02:48,526
This is the package.
No exchanges, no returns.

906
01:02:48,596 --> 01:02:49,824
- Yes.
- Right?

907
01:02:49,898 --> 01:02:51,126
- Hot!
- Thank you.

908
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:53,133
<i>I mean, why does</i>
<i>our society push us...</i>

909
01:02:53,201 --> 01:02:55,635
<i>to be perpetually uncomfortable</i>
<i>with who we are?</i>

910
01:02:55,703 --> 01:02:57,728
<i>It's so messed up.</i>
<i>You wanna know why?</i>

911
01:02:57,806 --> 01:03:00,400
Here. This is why.
"Boost your buttocks in five days."

912
01:03:00,475 --> 01:03:02,943
"Luscious liposuction."
"The flawless face-lift."

913
01:03:03,011 --> 01:03:04,979
That's why.
Enough is enough.

914
01:03:05,046 --> 01:03:08,072
<i>We need to stop letting</i>
<i>society and-and media...</i>

915
01:03:08,149 --> 01:03:10,310
<i>and our religious leaders</i>
<i>delegate who we are.</i>

916
01:03:10,385 --> 01:03:12,751
You're amazing,
and I'm even more amazing...

917
01:03:12,821 --> 01:03:16,848
and anybody who doesn't get it
can go screw themselves!

918
01:03:21,162 --> 01:03:23,926
That felt fantastic.

919
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:28,063
<i>Spewing is a wonderful thing.</i>

920
01:03:28,136 --> 01:03:30,934
Forget spinning classes.
They should have spewing classes.

921
01:03:31,005 --> 01:03:34,771
That's what they should have.

922
01:03:37,812 --> 01:03:40,872
Where are you going?
You have a creative meeting in five minutes.

923
01:03:50,792 --> 01:03:53,625
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

924
01:03:53,695 --> 01:03:56,095
- That page wasn't from you, was it?
- It was.

925
01:03:56,164 --> 01:03:58,997
This better be good. I'm about to get prepped
for surgery. What is it?

926
01:03:59,067 --> 01:04:01,058
- I need to tell you something.
- I'm listening.

927
01:04:04,472 --> 01:04:06,133
Maybe you should just
get prepped for surgery—

928
01:04:06,207 --> 01:04:08,141
Maybe you should perform the surgery.
I'll come back later.

929
01:04:08,209 --> 01:04:10,439
Gray.

930
01:04:11,546 --> 01:04:13,480
I have to tell you something.
It's not easy.

931
01:04:13,548 --> 01:04:15,982
It's really major,
and I don't know how to say it.

932
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:19,645
- Why don't you take three short breaths and one—
- One long.

933
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:45,074
- I'm gay.
- What?

934
01:04:45,146 --> 01:04:47,910
- As in Marvin.
- What?

935
01:04:47,982 --> 01:04:50,473
As in, take the "R" out of"Gray,"
and— Bingo!

936
01:04:54,355 --> 01:04:56,323
Oh.

937
01:05:09,504 --> 01:05:12,530
- That's great.
- What about it is great?

938
01:05:12,607 --> 01:05:15,371
- It's great that you're coming out.
- Don't tell me you knew.

939
01:05:15,443 --> 01:05:17,877
<i>Gray, of course I knew.</i>

940
01:05:17,946 --> 01:05:19,937
How can you know
when I didn't even know?

941
01:05:20,014 --> 01:05:23,142
I'm smarter than you. I've known since second
grade, when you had a crush on Mrs. Wertheimer...

942
01:05:23,217 --> 01:05:26,015
- and tried to look up her skirt.
- She was cute, wasn't she?

943
01:05:26,087 --> 01:05:27,714
Tell you, I'm proud of you, Gray.

944
01:05:27,789 --> 01:05:32,123
- This is a big moment. This is huge.
- It's big, all right...

945
01:05:32,193 --> 01:05:35,060
but there's one other thing
I haven't told you, and it's even bigger.

946
01:05:35,129 --> 01:05:39,156
Bigger. Yeah.
It can't possibly be bigger than this.

947
01:05:39,233 --> 01:05:42,225
- Well, I guess it depends on how you see it.
- What is it?

948
01:05:44,172 --> 01:05:46,902
- I'm in love with her.
- Who?

949
01:05:46,975 --> 01:05:48,340
- Her.
- Who her?

950
01:05:48,409 --> 01:05:50,969
- Your wife.
- Whose wife?

951
01:05:51,045 --> 01:05:53,070
Yours. I'm in love with Charlie.

952
01:05:53,147 --> 01:05:56,048
- Is this your idea of a bad joke?
- I would never joke about it.

953
01:05:56,117 --> 01:05:58,517
I love the way she talked
and walked and looked and felt...

954
01:05:58,586 --> 01:06:01,680
but it really kicked in
after we kissed.

955
01:06:03,891 --> 01:06:05,825
Kissed?

956
01:06:05,893 --> 01:06:08,327
What do you mean, kissed?
Are you saying you kissed my wife?

957
01:06:08,396 --> 01:06:10,193
Only once,
and technically she wasn't your wife.

958
01:06:10,264 --> 01:06:12,892
It was the night
before your wedding.

959
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:17,904
I'm sorry.
Look, I never expected this to happen.

960
01:06:17,972 --> 01:06:19,997
Just tell me off.
Just yell at me.

961
01:06:20,074 --> 01:06:23,168
I know I'm a terrible person.
I'm a terrible, terrible person.

962
01:06:23,244 --> 01:06:26,407
Gray, I want you to pack up your shit
and get it out of the apartment...

963
01:06:26,481 --> 01:06:28,574
by the time I get home tonight,
because we're done.

964
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:30,675
All right? We're done.

965
01:07:16,631 --> 01:07:18,565
<i>There has to be a reason.</i>

966
01:07:18,633 --> 01:07:20,863
Why would she move out
without talking to us about it...

967
01:07:20,935 --> 01:07:22,869
or even telling us
where she was going?

968
01:07:22,937 --> 01:07:25,167
- Why are you so concerned?
- What is that supposed to mean?

969
01:07:25,239 --> 01:07:26,934
It's not supposed to mean anything.

970
01:07:27,008 --> 01:07:29,238
- You seem obsessed about my sister, that's all.
- That's ridiculous.

971
01:07:29,310 --> 01:07:31,244
- Is it?
- I'm just worried about her.

972
01:07:31,312 --> 01:07:33,143
Aren't you happy we'll
have the place to ourselves?

973
01:07:33,214 --> 01:07:35,409
- Of course I'm happy.
- All right then.

974
01:07:35,483 --> 01:07:37,576
- That's not the issue.
- What's the issue?

975
01:07:37,652 --> 01:07:39,643
Did you guys get
in a fight or something?

976
01:07:39,721 --> 01:07:41,746
- What aren't you telling me?
- I'm not telling you anything.

977
01:07:41,823 --> 01:07:43,916
- Is there something you want to tell me?
- Like what?

978
01:07:43,991 --> 01:07:45,925
I don't know.
You tell me.

979
01:07:45,993 --> 01:07:50,225
Sam, what's going on?
You're acting weird. You love your sister.

980
01:07:50,298 --> 01:07:53,461
Yes, I love my sister. How about you?
Do you love my sister?

981
01:07:53,534 --> 01:07:55,764
Of course I love your sister.
I think she's great.

982
01:07:55,837 --> 01:07:57,771
"Great." How great?

983
01:07:57,839 --> 01:08:00,205
- What are you getting at?
- Nothing. Nothing.

984
01:08:00,274 --> 01:08:03,539
You know what? I'm late.
I gotta go, okay? I'll see you later.

985
01:08:03,611 --> 01:08:05,545
Sam?

986
01:08:52,093 --> 01:08:56,052
So as you can see, the consumers love
to think of nothing but C-Pro.

987
01:08:56,130 --> 01:08:58,655
- B-Pro.
- What?

988
01:08:58,733 --> 01:09:02,533
- B-Pro. You said "C-Pro."
- I did?

989
01:09:02,603 --> 01:09:05,037
Yeah, you said C-Pro.
I'm very sorry.

990
01:09:05,106 --> 01:09:08,200
Would you excuse me for a minute?
I have to get a glass of water.

991
01:09:08,276 --> 01:09:10,005
Take your time.

992
01:09:13,614 --> 01:09:16,742
I'll be back in just one minute.
I'll... be back.

993
01:09:16,818 --> 01:09:20,879
Gray, hang in there. You're doing just fine.

994
01:09:20,955 --> 01:09:23,355
- No, I'm not doing fine. I'm the <i>Titanic.</i>
- No!

995
01:09:23,424 --> 01:09:25,392
- Yes.
- You just gotta—You gotta get focused.

996
01:09:25,459 --> 01:09:28,087
You gotta center yourself,
and you gotta march back in there...

997
01:09:28,162 --> 01:09:30,096
and you show them who's the boss.

998
01:09:30,164 --> 01:09:32,394
<i>Who's the Boss?</i> I hated that show.
I love Alyssa Milano.

999
01:09:32,466 --> 01:09:35,435
I don't like Tony Danza, and Judith Light
had really weird hair, but—

1000
01:09:35,503 --> 01:09:37,869
Gray! You gotta focus.
Focus, okay?

1001
01:09:37,939 --> 01:09:41,306
You gotta get out of your head
and get into your body.

1002
01:09:41,375 --> 01:09:43,138
Get out of your head
and into your body.

1003
01:09:43,211 --> 01:09:45,145
Get out of your head
and into your body.

1004
01:09:45,213 --> 01:09:47,306
Get out of your head.
Get out of your head.

1005
01:09:47,381 --> 01:09:49,872
Get out of your head
and into your body.

1006
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:52,385
Take a deep breath.
Feel your feet on the ground.

1007
01:09:52,453 --> 01:09:55,222
Center yourself.

1008
01:09:55,355 --> 01:09:56,913
- And go.
- Go.

1009
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:58,821
Go.

1010
01:09:58,892 --> 01:10:01,952
<i>Gimme a "P."Gimme an "R."</i>

1011
01:10:02,028 --> 01:10:04,053
Gimme an "O."

1012
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:07,224
What's that spell?

1013
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:10,167
<i>B- Pro!</i>

1014
01:10:10,237 --> 01:10:12,569
<i>Yeah! Whoo!</i>

1015
01:10:15,242 --> 01:10:17,176
Lana, what the hell are you doing?

1016
01:10:17,244 --> 01:10:20,111
I promoted Miss Valentine
to creative executive on the Bartlett account...

1017
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:23,115
because I thought it would be best
to show Julia two perspectives.

1018
01:10:23,183 --> 01:10:25,913
- You mean the one of her tits
and the one of her ass?
- Gray!

1019
01:10:25,986 --> 01:10:28,454
I'm sure that Lana
has 36 double-D ideas...

1020
01:10:28,521 --> 01:10:32,514
<i>for the account, and I'll just give you</i>
<i>your privacy to fondle through them.</i>

1021
01:10:35,695 --> 01:10:38,255
I think that was a brilliant comeback.
Clever and descriptive.

1022
01:10:38,331 --> 01:10:40,322
I'm sure it cost me my job.

1023
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,834
Well, with copy like that,
they should be begging you to stay.

1024
01:10:42,902 --> 01:10:45,496
Here. Drink that
while it's still hot.

1025
01:10:47,007 --> 01:10:51,501
That, young lady,
is my granny's secret recipe.

1026
01:10:51,578 --> 01:10:55,105
Mmm! This is so good.
What's in this?

1027
01:10:55,181 --> 01:10:59,015
Oh, uh, tea, milk, honey
and a wee bit of nutmeg.

1028
01:10:59,085 --> 01:11:02,020
<i>Gordy, you are amazing.</i>

1029
01:11:02,088 --> 01:11:05,455
<i>You barely know me</i>
<i>and you're such a great friend.</i>

1030
01:11:05,525 --> 01:11:09,393
You're gonna make
some lucky girl very happy one day.

1031
01:11:10,930 --> 01:11:12,898
So are you.

1032
01:11:17,137 --> 01:11:19,071
God, everything is so complicated.

1033
01:11:19,139 --> 01:11:22,165
If it was 30 years ago,
I could just move away and join a convent.

1034
01:11:22,242 --> 01:11:26,144
Those outfits are so hideous.

1035
01:11:27,213 --> 01:11:29,613
You know, if you want
my advice—

1036
01:11:29,683 --> 01:11:33,779
and I don't suppose you do,
but I'm going to give it to you anyway.

1037
01:11:33,853 --> 01:11:37,584
- I think you have to go and talk to Charlie.
- About what?

1038
01:11:37,657 --> 01:11:39,522
You have to tell her the truth.

1039
01:11:39,592 --> 01:11:41,082
- I can't do that.
<i>- Yes, you can.</i>

1040
01:11:41,161 --> 01:11:43,254
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1041
01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:46,595
I mean, for all you know,
she might feel the same way about you.

1042
01:11:46,666 --> 01:11:49,533
Come on. Her name is Charlie.
You've got a shot.

1043
01:11:49,602 --> 01:11:51,695
<i>But you won't know that</i>
<i>until you talk to her.</i>

1044
01:11:51,771 --> 01:11:54,899
What if I made it up?
What if she doesn't even remember the kiss?

1045
01:11:54,974 --> 01:11:57,841
What if you go through
your entire life saying, "What if?"

1046
01:11:57,911 --> 01:11:59,742
What happens if she does
feel the same way?

1047
01:11:59,813 --> 01:12:01,678
What about Sam?
He'll never talk to me again.

1048
01:12:01,748 --> 01:12:04,376
- He doesn't talk to you now.
- That's just 'cause he hates me.

1049
01:12:04,451 --> 01:12:06,442
And do you foresee that
ever changing?

1050
01:12:06,519 --> 01:12:10,046
- He can't hate me forever.
- Mm-hmm. Just drink your tea.

1051
01:12:13,927 --> 01:12:15,861
This is so good.

1052
01:12:15,929 --> 01:12:17,954
Are you sure this is just tea,
nutmeg and honey?

1053
01:12:18,031 --> 01:12:21,091
Wee bit of whiskey.

1054
01:12:21,167 --> 01:12:23,863
- Would you like some shortbread?
- Mmm!

1055
01:12:23,937 --> 01:12:25,871
What kind of shortbread is this?

1056
01:12:25,939 --> 01:12:28,567
Mmm, short.

1057
01:12:28,708 --> 01:12:31,108
<i> God, they're so beautiful</i>
<i>and magical and peaceful.</i>

1058
01:12:31,177 --> 01:12:33,111
<i>Will they have babies here?</i>

1059
01:12:33,179 --> 01:12:36,740
I don't think so.
That's Lucy, and she's Ethel.

1060
01:12:36,816 --> 01:12:38,750
- They're an item?
- Mm-hmm.

1061
01:12:38,818 --> 01:12:40,911
They never spend a moment apart.
It's very common.

1062
01:12:40,987 --> 01:12:44,388
I'm actually doing a study on homosexuality
among mammals.

1063
01:12:44,457 --> 01:12:46,322
- You are?
- I'm concentrating on whales...

1064
01:12:46,393 --> 01:12:49,419
but did you know
that over 50% of elephants are gay?

1065
01:12:49,496 --> 01:12:52,158
- How do they test that?
- They pipe in the Village People...

1066
01:12:52,232 --> 01:12:54,325
over loudspeakers
and watch their feet.

1067
01:12:55,902 --> 01:12:58,894
I'm kidding.

1068
01:12:58,972 --> 01:13:00,963
So where've you been hiding?

1069
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:04,669
I've left three messages and no answer,
and Sam won't say a word.

1070
01:13:04,744 --> 01:13:06,974
I'm sorry.
I've just been a little preoccupied.

1071
01:13:07,046 --> 01:13:09,071
Anything you want to talk about?

1072
01:13:09,149 --> 01:13:13,347
Do you remember that night
we spent together in Las Vegas
before you got married to Sam?

1073
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:16,412
Barely. I mean, I remember
having a great time...

1074
01:13:16,489 --> 01:13:19,652
but I think you got me too drunk
to remember anything else.

1075
01:13:21,027 --> 01:13:22,961
Why? Did I say something
really stupid?

1076
01:13:23,029 --> 01:13:26,430
- It's not what you said.
- God. What did I do?

1077
01:13:26,499 --> 01:13:29,662
I don't know if you did anything.
It might have just been me.

1078
01:13:29,736 --> 01:13:33,035
- Oh, my God. I remember.
- You do?

1079
01:13:33,106 --> 01:13:36,837
- Yes. I'm such an idiot.
- No, you're not.

1080
01:13:36,910 --> 01:13:38,969
How could you let
your brother marry me?

1081
01:13:39,045 --> 01:13:41,479
I didn't know if you were conscious
of what was going on.

1082
01:13:41,548 --> 01:13:43,675
Of course I was conscious.
I'm so embarrassed.

1083
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:46,275
Don't be.
I'm so relieved we're talking about it.

1084
01:13:46,352 --> 01:13:48,980
- Was I completely off-key?
- What?

1085
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:51,023
I sounded like a cat in heat,
didn't I?

1086
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:53,490
Is that what you think
we're talking about?

1087
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:55,687
Oh, God.
Did I do something else?

1088
01:14:02,735 --> 01:14:05,829
- No. That was it.
- Are you sure?

1089
01:14:05,905 --> 01:14:08,135
- Yeah.
<i>- Tell the truth.</i>

1090
01:14:08,208 --> 01:14:10,403
Did you try to convince Sam
not to marry me?

1091
01:14:10,477 --> 01:14:13,878
There was no convincing him.
Trust me. If I could have, I would have.

1092
01:14:15,081 --> 01:14:18,414
You know, every morning
I wake up before Sam does...

1093
01:14:18,485 --> 01:14:20,885
and I just watch him.

1094
01:14:20,954 --> 01:14:23,718
I just lie there and stare.

1095
01:14:25,925 --> 01:14:28,450
And I love the way his nose wrinkles
when he's dreaming...

1096
01:14:28,528 --> 01:14:31,656
and the little purring sound that he makes
when he's about to wake up.

1097
01:14:31,731 --> 01:14:35,064
<i>And the way that he keeps his hand</i>
<i>on my thigh the whole night...</i>

1098
01:14:35,134 --> 01:14:38,695
just to let me know that he's there.

1099
01:14:38,771 --> 01:14:42,070
<i>And I know it may seem crazy...</i>

1100
01:14:42,141 --> 01:14:45,440
but love is crazy, isn't it?

1101
01:14:45,512 --> 01:14:48,413
It sure is.

1102
01:15:29,022 --> 01:15:31,081
- Hey.
- Hey.

1103
01:15:31,157 --> 01:15:35,093
I was cleaning out the closet.
I found Dad's old projector.

1104
01:15:36,729 --> 01:15:38,663
Is that you?

1105
01:15:38,731 --> 01:15:41,063
Yeah.

1106
01:15:41,134 --> 01:15:43,068
Cute little surgeon, wasn't I?

1107
01:15:47,307 --> 01:15:50,640
<i>You're so lucky.</i>
<i>I never had a brother or sister.</i>

1108
01:15:54,981 --> 01:15:56,972
Oh!

1109
01:16:05,058 --> 01:16:07,288
<i>I don't know what's going on</i>
<i>between the two of you...</i>

1110
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:10,591
but you have to work it out, Sam.

1111
01:16:10,663 --> 01:16:12,688
Just talk to her.

1112
01:16:25,278 --> 01:16:27,337
- You wanted to see me?
- Oh, yeah. Gray.

1113
01:16:27,413 --> 01:16:31,782
Seems Julia wasn't thrilled with the way
our last presentation went.

1114
01:16:31,851 --> 01:16:33,785
Why don't you go ahead and fire me?

1115
01:16:33,853 --> 01:16:36,219
I don't need to be embarrassed or humiliated
or patronized anymore.

1116
01:16:36,289 --> 01:16:40,157
- Actually, I was gonna give you a promotion, but—
- What?

1117
01:16:40,226 --> 01:16:43,252
I asked Jordan to make you the executive
creative director on my account...

1118
01:16:43,329 --> 01:16:47,129
and to give you free rein
to do whatever you want.

1119
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:50,033
Carrie told me that the cheerleader idea
was yours.

1120
01:16:50,103 --> 01:16:52,936
<i>I think you have great ideas.</i>

1121
01:16:53,006 --> 01:16:56,498
You just haven't been given the freedom
to explore them fully.

1122
01:16:56,576 --> 01:17:01,707
I like your energy,
your spunk, your candidness...

1123
01:17:01,781 --> 01:17:04,249
<i>and I think</i>
<i>with the right support...</i>

1124
01:17:04,317 --> 01:17:06,979
you're gonna give me
exactly what I'm looking for.

1125
01:17:07,053 --> 01:17:08,987
Wow!

1126
01:17:09,055 --> 01:17:12,422
- I don't know what to say.
<i>- Sorry to interrupt, Gray...</i>

1127
01:17:12,492 --> 01:17:16,258
<i>but your 12:00 meeting with Brother</i>
<i>Electronics is in the small conference room.</i>

1128
01:17:16,329 --> 01:17:19,264
Oh, I don't have a 12:00 meeting
with Brother Electronics.

1129
01:17:19,332 --> 01:17:21,562
<i>They said they confirmed it</i>
<i>with your office.</i>

1130
01:17:21,634 --> 01:17:23,932
Please, go ahead.
I don't want to hold you up.

1131
01:17:24,003 --> 01:17:26,130
Thank you so much.
You will not be sorry.

1132
01:17:26,205 --> 01:17:28,935
Thank you, Mr. Phillips.
I will not let you down.

1133
01:17:33,146 --> 01:17:36,707
Isn't she adorable?

1134
01:17:41,154 --> 01:17:44,282
Hi! Sorry I'm late.
I didn't have you in my book.

1135
01:17:47,794 --> 01:17:49,785
Hey.

1136
01:17:51,397 --> 01:17:53,729
<i>See, you forgot your toothbrush...</i>

1137
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:58,430
and I figured a toothbrush that is part hard,
part soft bristles...

1138
01:17:58,504 --> 01:18:00,563
must be hard to come by.

1139
01:18:03,342 --> 01:18:05,606
Is that all?
You just came to give me my toothbrush?

1140
01:18:05,678 --> 01:18:08,340
And to say I'm sorry.

1141
01:18:08,414 --> 01:18:11,542
I overreacted—
Little bit. Not a lot. Little bit.

1142
01:18:11,617 --> 01:18:13,585
After all, you have to admit...

1143
01:18:13,653 --> 01:18:16,986
it's a pretty exceptional situation, right?

1144
01:18:17,056 --> 01:18:19,286
- Uh-huh.
- On the other hand...

1145
01:18:19,358 --> 01:18:21,292
I'm not quite sure
why I got so surprised...

1146
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,328
'cause if you think about it...

1147
01:18:23,396 --> 01:18:27,162
it's almost inevitable that you and I would end up
liking the same girl, isn't it?

1148
01:18:27,233 --> 01:18:29,463
You're acting—
You're acting very rational. It's too rational.

1149
01:18:29,535 --> 01:18:31,469
You used to do this
when we were kids.

1150
01:18:31,537 --> 01:18:33,471
Then I'd turn around
and you'd tackle me.

1151
01:18:33,539 --> 01:18:35,769
I should be getting my knees
in the lock-down position.

1152
01:18:35,842 --> 01:18:38,037
You know, Gray—

1153
01:18:38,111 --> 01:18:41,512
Gray, you're not just my sister.
You're my best friend.

1154
01:18:41,581 --> 01:18:44,106
You know that, right?

1155
01:18:44,183 --> 01:18:46,583
Being without you
I feel like one half of me is missing.

1156
01:18:46,652 --> 01:18:48,586
Lately I've been feeling
very lopsided.

1157
01:18:48,654 --> 01:18:51,851
- Oh, Sam.
- Just 'cause you're totally gay...

1158
01:18:51,924 --> 01:18:54,950
and in love with my wife doesn't mean
we can't work things out.

1159
01:18:56,028 --> 01:18:58,622
Oh, my God!
Oh, my <i>God!</i>

1160
01:18:58,698 --> 01:19:02,259
- Oh, my God!
- Ooh. Now, this is <i>good.</i>

1161
01:19:02,335 --> 01:19:04,633
I knew it wasn't me.
I knew it wasn't me!

1162
01:19:10,243 --> 01:19:14,043
- Oh, my—
- Gray!

1163
01:19:14,113 --> 01:19:16,843
Gray! Gray!

1164
01:19:16,916 --> 01:19:19,146
How ya doin'? How ya doin'?
Nothin' to see here, folks.

1165
01:19:19,218 --> 01:19:21,118
Put your eyes back in your heads.

1166
01:19:30,463 --> 01:19:32,397
Hey, what—

1167
01:19:32,465 --> 01:19:36,026
- What are you doing?
- I wanna die right now, in this elevator.

1168
01:19:36,102 --> 01:19:38,570
- I never wanna see
another human being ever again.
- No. Look.

1169
01:19:38,638 --> 01:19:40,572
Gray, listen to me.
This is not as bad—

1170
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:42,574
Who cares what those people think?

1171
01:19:42,642 --> 01:19:45,668
I care. They're probably calling Jerry Springer
right now as we speak.

1172
01:19:45,745 --> 01:19:48,339
No. No, they're not.
I don't think he has a show anymore.

1173
01:19:48,414 --> 01:19:51,008
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?

1174
01:19:51,083 --> 01:19:53,415
For having to be related to me.

1175
01:19:53,486 --> 01:19:56,319
- Gray, don't be ridiculous.
- Oh, I just feel—

1176
01:19:56,389 --> 01:19:58,789
Gray, look. You're just—
You're just coming out, okay?

1177
01:19:58,858 --> 01:20:01,554
- I am never coming out of this elevator.
- This is probably...

1178
01:20:01,627 --> 01:20:03,925
the biggest revelation
of your entire life.

1179
01:20:03,996 --> 01:20:05,930
It's normal to be going nuts.

1180
01:20:05,998 --> 01:20:07,989
<i>- It's normal.</i>
- I don't feel normal.

1181
01:20:08,067 --> 01:20:10,968
I'm sick and tired of everyone saying
it's normal, it's typical, it's ordinary.

1182
01:20:11,037 --> 01:20:13,164
I don't feel any of those things.

1183
01:20:13,239 --> 01:20:15,605
Well, how do you feel?

1184
01:20:18,978 --> 01:20:21,105
- Lonely.
- Why?

1185
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:24,377
Because I'm never gonna be able
to walk down the street...

1186
01:20:24,450 --> 01:20:26,577
holding hands with my partner...

1187
01:20:26,652 --> 01:20:29,621
without the rest of the worid
giving us a look.

1188
01:20:29,689 --> 01:20:32,624
I may never have the wedding
that I once dreamed of...

1189
01:20:32,692 --> 01:20:35,126
and I may never have children...

1190
01:20:35,194 --> 01:20:37,355
and one day, when I die...

1191
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:40,194
people will never give
as much respect to my grieving lover...

1192
01:20:40,266 --> 01:20:43,030
as if she were my husband.

1193
01:20:52,778 --> 01:20:55,178
Gray...

1194
01:20:55,248 --> 01:20:58,274
it's not as if you made a choice.

1195
01:20:58,351 --> 01:21:00,615
That's what terrifies me.

1196
01:21:00,686 --> 01:21:04,087
It's so much easier
to be someone else.

1197
01:21:04,156 --> 01:21:07,887
Do you remember
when we were kids—

1198
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:10,622
<i>you would have been</i>
<i>about six</i>—

1199
01:21:10,696 --> 01:21:14,367
and Dad came home to tell Mom
he was leaving her for Mrs. Rosemont.

1200
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:16,365
Yeah.

1201
01:21:16,435 --> 01:21:19,598
<i>Remember we stayed</i>
<i>in the closet all night...</i>

1202
01:21:19,672 --> 01:21:23,608
just cuddled up like
two little mice and...

1203
01:21:24,677 --> 01:21:26,770
listened to their whole fight.

1204
01:21:30,850 --> 01:21:32,841
I was...

1205
01:21:35,354 --> 01:21:37,822
so angry.

1206
01:21:37,890 --> 01:21:41,257
I was... hurt.
I was just—

1207
01:21:42,661 --> 01:21:45,528
I was mad, and I wanted to go out there
and kick his ass...

1208
01:21:45,598 --> 01:21:49,625
- and you remember what you said to me?
- Hmm.

1209
01:21:49,702 --> 01:21:52,330
You were just six...

1210
01:21:52,405 --> 01:21:55,806
but you said it was gonna be okay...

1211
01:21:55,875 --> 01:21:58,036
that Dad was not gonna live a lie...

1212
01:21:58,110 --> 01:22:00,601
that he was gonna try
and be happy...

1213
01:22:02,815 --> 01:22:05,807
and that everyone
deserved to be happy.

1214
01:22:05,885 --> 01:22:07,853
I said that?

1215
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:10,354
- Yeah.
- I was so profound.

1216
01:22:13,325 --> 01:22:15,725
Why are you being so nice to me?

1217
01:22:15,795 --> 01:22:19,094
- You should hate me.
- For what? For having good taste?

1218
01:22:20,132 --> 01:22:22,100
You never have to worry about it.

1219
01:22:22,168 --> 01:22:24,432
I mean, she's completely,
madly, passionately...

1220
01:22:24,503 --> 01:22:27,438
like cow-jump-over-the-moon
in love with you.

1221
01:22:27,506 --> 01:22:29,565
- Really?
- Yeah.

1222
01:22:30,709 --> 01:22:33,576
That's great... for me.
Not so great for you.

1223
01:22:33,646 --> 01:22:37,138
But you're not gonna
make me feel guilty for this are you?

1224
01:22:37,216 --> 01:22:39,446
Mm-mmm.

1225
01:22:39,518 --> 01:22:41,486
Gray, you know what?

1226
01:22:41,554 --> 01:22:44,148
You can't expect the first girl
that you fall in love with...

1227
01:22:44,223 --> 01:22:46,157
to love you back.

1228
01:22:46,225 --> 01:22:48,159
That's—That's not how it works.

1229
01:22:48,227 --> 01:22:51,685
That would be the equivalent
of settling down when you were age 12.

1230
01:22:51,764 --> 01:22:54,597
You haven't gone
through gay puberty yet.

1231
01:22:57,403 --> 01:23:00,566
- I think I'm ready to come out.
- To everyone?

1232
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:03,233
- No. Of the elevator.
- Of the elevator.

1233
01:23:11,317 --> 01:23:13,615
I should have broken up
with Dereck ages ago.

1234
01:23:13,686 --> 01:23:15,620
I am having the best time.

1235
01:23:15,688 --> 01:23:18,452
- So what about you? Have you met anyone yet?
- Not yet.

1236
01:23:18,524 --> 01:23:20,924
Really? Giris should be lining up
around the block for you.

1237
01:23:20,993 --> 01:23:22,927
- What's your type?
- I don't have a type.

1238
01:23:22,995 --> 01:23:25,589
I mean, like the basics.
Like, brunette, blonde, short, tall?

1239
01:23:25,664 --> 01:23:27,598
It depends, I guess.

1240
01:23:27,666 --> 01:23:29,930
- Funny. You need funny.
- Funny would be good.

1241
01:23:30,002 --> 01:23:31,993
- And stylish. No Birkenstocks.
- That's for sure.

1242
01:23:32,071 --> 01:23:34,005
And for the love of God,
don't wind up...

1243
01:23:34,073 --> 01:23:36,200
with one of those ladies
who doesn't believe in waxing.

1244
01:23:36,275 --> 01:23:38,800
- You're killing me.
- Can I ask you a question?

1245
01:23:38,878 --> 01:23:40,812
- Yeah.
- Have you ever been attracted to me?

1246
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,814
- No.
- Really?

1247
01:23:42,882 --> 01:23:44,816
- No.
- Not even a little?

1248
01:23:44,884 --> 01:23:47,045
- No.
- Huh. Oh.

1249
01:23:47,119 --> 01:23:50,088
Not even last year, when I was in shape
after taking those Pilates classes?

1250
01:23:50,155 --> 01:23:52,783
Or last week when I wore that pink
Marc Jacobs dress to work...

1251
01:23:52,858 --> 01:23:54,792
and you told me how cute I looked?

1252
01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:57,886
You looked so cute. You <i>are</i> cute,
but, you know, not cute that way, cute.

1253
01:23:57,963 --> 01:23:59,897
Hmm. Wow.
That's so depressing.

1254
01:23:59,965 --> 01:24:03,196
It's not like I'm into giris,
but if I was a girl who was into giris...

1255
01:24:03,269 --> 01:24:05,499
I'd definitely be into me,
'cause I think I'm a catch.

1256
01:24:05,571 --> 01:24:08,233
You are a catch,
but, uh, I don't know, you're not my type.

1257
01:24:08,307 --> 01:24:10,366
Hmm. But you said
you don't have a type.

1258
01:24:10,442 --> 01:24:13,570
- You gotta stop talking about this.
- All right.

1259
01:24:13,646 --> 01:24:15,841
Wait. Don't you usually have
therapy at lunchtime on Thursdays?

1260
01:24:15,915 --> 01:24:18,850
Oh, my God.
I'm so late. Shoot.

1261
01:24:20,419 --> 01:24:23,752
Okay. You know, I don't really want to go,
so watch this.

1262
01:24:27,159 --> 01:24:29,093
Sydney, it's Gray.

1263
01:24:29,161 --> 01:24:31,789
I'm sorry I'm late,
but I don't wanna go to the batting cages...

1264
01:24:31,864 --> 01:24:34,492
and I don't wanna go rock climbing
or bowling or anywhere with you...

1265
01:24:34,567 --> 01:24:36,558
'cause I'm feeling
really good about myself...

1266
01:24:36,635 --> 01:24:39,604
and I don't think you're
a very good therapist for me, so you're fired.

1267
01:24:39,672 --> 01:24:41,640
Thank you, and have a nice day.

1268
01:24:41,707 --> 01:24:44,437
- That was crazy.
- Can you believe I just did that?

1269
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:46,501
That was amazing.

1270
01:24:46,579 --> 01:24:49,673
Do you want to get a mani-pedi
before we go back to work?

1271
01:24:49,748 --> 01:24:51,716
- Sure. I need a pedicure.
- Yeah.

1272
01:24:51,784 --> 01:24:54,617
What if I dyed my hair red?
Would you be attracted to me then?

1273
01:24:54,687 --> 01:24:56,678
- Yes.
- Really?

1274
01:24:56,755 --> 01:24:59,690
- You're hot.
- Ooh, mah-moo!

1275
01:25:14,273 --> 01:25:16,901
I can't go through with this.

1276
01:25:16,976 --> 01:25:20,412
- Yes, you can.
- Why do I have to?

1277
01:25:20,479 --> 01:25:23,209
Because you're gay,
and you have to start behavin' like it.

1278
01:25:23,282 --> 01:25:25,716
What am I supposed to do?
Wear a sign on my forehead?

1279
01:25:25,784 --> 01:25:27,809
No, but you haven't
had sex with a woman yet...

1280
01:25:27,886 --> 01:25:30,184
and, you know,
that's like being black...

1281
01:25:30,255 --> 01:25:32,746
and never having listened
to the Jackson Five...

1282
01:25:32,825 --> 01:25:35,350
or being Jewish
and never having a knish...

1283
01:25:35,427 --> 01:25:38,396
or being Indian and never
having had a curry or being—

1284
01:25:38,464 --> 01:25:41,092
Or being Scottish
and not keeping your mouth shut?

1285
01:25:41,166 --> 01:25:43,464
- I suppose so. Come on.
- Hi.

1286
01:25:47,506 --> 01:25:49,633
Sorry. No men allowed.

1287
01:25:49,708 --> 01:25:51,642
Wh— Isn't that against the law?

1288
01:25:51,710 --> 01:25:53,940
- And I'm only goin' in for a wee minute.
- Yeah.

1289
01:25:54,013 --> 01:25:57,949
- No exceptions. No men.
- Forget it.

1290
01:25:58,017 --> 01:26:00,008
Well, just go in by yourself.

1291
01:26:00,085 --> 01:26:02,383
I can't go in by myself.
Are you kidding?

1292
01:26:02,454 --> 01:26:04,479
I have an idea.

1293
01:26:09,495 --> 01:26:12,623
I would like an Apricot Sour, please.

1294
01:26:14,299 --> 01:26:16,859
I'll have a Cosmo.
Not too much cranberry.

1295
01:26:16,935 --> 01:26:19,028
And a touch of lemon
and a squeeze of lime.

1296
01:26:19,104 --> 01:26:21,038
And a little bit of sugar
on the rim.

1297
01:26:21,106 --> 01:26:23,734
Comin' up.

1298
01:26:23,809 --> 01:26:25,800
Apricot Sour?

1299
01:26:25,878 --> 01:26:28,244
I thought that was what you women drank,
for Christ's sakes.

1300
01:26:28,313 --> 01:26:32,477
- One of your eyelashes is coming off.
- Give me a mirror, quick.

1301
01:26:38,023 --> 01:26:40,753
Hi. Can I buy you a drink?

1302
01:26:44,329 --> 01:26:48,493
Oh, no.
Um, I don't drink.

1303
01:26:48,567 --> 01:26:50,728
See, but thanks.

1304
01:26:51,870 --> 01:26:53,804
You don't?

1305
01:26:59,845 --> 01:27:02,609
Shut up.

1306
01:27:05,551 --> 01:27:08,281
This is quite tasty, actually.

1307
01:27:16,161 --> 01:27:18,686
Let's get out of here.
I'm not gonna meet anyone here.

1308
01:27:18,764 --> 01:27:20,595
Hey, give it a minute.

1309
01:27:31,043 --> 01:27:33,204
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>It's Julia Bartlett.</i>

1310
01:27:33,278 --> 01:27:36,179
- Quick, quick. I gotta get out of here.
- Why?

1311
01:27:36,248 --> 01:27:40,184
- Can't have her see me in a gay bar.
- Hello. Is there anybody in?

1312
01:27:42,087 --> 01:27:44,248
No. Her? You think?

1313
01:27:44,323 --> 01:27:46,348
Gray, did your mom ever tell you...

1314
01:27:46,425 --> 01:27:48,723
what your I.Q. Scores were?

1315
01:27:51,230 --> 01:27:53,664
- Hi, Gray.
- Hello.

1316
01:27:53,732 --> 01:27:55,461
- It's nice to see you.
- Nice to see you too.

1317
01:27:55,534 --> 01:27:58,367
I'm just taking a break
from working on your account.

1318
01:27:58,437 --> 01:28:01,235
Gray, I didn't come over here
to check up on you.

1319
01:28:05,377 --> 01:28:08,175
Um, hello.

1320
01:28:08,247 --> 01:28:09,908
Uh, my name's Georgette.

1321
01:28:09,982 --> 01:28:11,313
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

1322
01:28:11,383 --> 01:28:13,510
And, uh, lovely.

1323
01:28:13,585 --> 01:28:16,315
And I'm just gonna
leave you two to, uh—

1324
01:28:16,388 --> 01:28:19,824
to, uh— to catch up on everything.

1325
01:28:19,892 --> 01:28:21,655
- Mmm. Lovely.
- Don't go.

1326
01:28:21,727 --> 01:28:24,161
Yeah, it was lovely to see you too.
Really nice. Really nice.

1327
01:28:24,229 --> 01:28:27,596
Dutch way—Three kisses.
So, uh—

1328
01:28:27,666 --> 01:28:30,601
Fine. It's fine.

1329
01:28:30,669 --> 01:28:35,072
I'm fine. You're fine. Everything's gonna
be fine, and I've got to go now. Bye.

1330
01:28:41,747 --> 01:28:44,079
You really surprised me
the other day.

1331
01:28:44,149 --> 01:28:46,777
I had no idea you were gay.

1332
01:28:46,852 --> 01:28:49,787
That makes two of us.

1333
01:28:49,855 --> 01:28:51,914
You're not just coming out, are you?

1334
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:54,515
Put it this way.

1335
01:28:54,593 --> 01:28:57,528
My hotel's been closed
for a long time...

1336
01:28:57,596 --> 01:29:00,463
but tonight's the grand opening.

1337
01:29:00,532 --> 01:29:02,796
There have been a few
fake openings...

1338
01:29:02,868 --> 01:29:05,701
but tonight's the real deal.

1339
01:29:06,772 --> 01:29:10,435
I— No, I don't understand.

1340
01:29:12,611 --> 01:29:15,307
Yes, I'm just coming out.

1341
01:29:17,282 --> 01:29:20,149
I don't think anyone in here will mind.

1342
01:29:28,193 --> 01:29:30,991
You really are adorable.

1343
01:29:31,063 --> 01:29:33,463
I always thought so.

1344
01:29:33,532 --> 01:29:35,466
Really?

1345
01:29:35,534 --> 01:29:40,335
From day one, in that little
cream, pin-striped suit you were wearing.

1346
01:29:41,406 --> 01:29:43,431
I like that suit too.

1347
01:29:43,508 --> 01:29:46,443
I think I got it at,
uh, Banana Republic.

1348
01:29:46,511 --> 01:29:49,412
Or maybe it was, uh,
Emporio Armani.

1349
01:29:49,481 --> 01:29:51,915
Actually, it could have been Barneys,
but the shirt was from Bloomies.

1350
01:29:51,984 --> 01:29:57,320
<i>Listen. I have this</i>
<i>beautiful bottle of cognac...</i>

1351
01:29:57,389 --> 01:30:00,415
<i>that I just brought back</i>
<i>from France, and I would</i>—

1352
01:30:00,492 --> 01:30:03,359
- I'd love to share it with you.
- You have it here with you?

1353
01:30:03,428 --> 01:30:05,953
No. My place.

1354
01:30:06,031 --> 01:30:09,467
- Oh.
- Central Park West and 85th.

1355
01:30:13,272 --> 01:30:16,264
Uh, okay, well—

1356
01:30:16,341 --> 01:30:18,332
I like cognac.

1357
01:30:18,410 --> 01:30:21,174
<i>I like cognac.</i>
<i>I like brandy too.</i>

1358
01:30:21,246 --> 01:30:23,840
Usually I have a little cognac
with a splash of brandy on the side.

1359
01:30:23,916 --> 01:30:26,384
I have brandy too.

1360
01:30:53,011 --> 01:30:55,912
- Give it up. You're toast.
- You're gonna eat those words.

1361
01:30:56,915 --> 01:30:58,576
<i>Come on, Gray! Come on!</i>
