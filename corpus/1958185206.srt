00:01:21,495 --> 00:01:23,945
Lost and lonely in every way.

00:01:28,398 --> 00:01:32,022
Got the flats all
around me, sky up above.

00:01:36,717 --> 00:01:38,960
Yes, I need a little water.

00:01:43,827 --> 00:01:47,762
I've been long lonely

some soothing rain.

00:02:01,328 --> 00:02:03,295
I believe I have taken enough.

water here to be found.

couldn't make it out there.

I'm OK.

I understand you're off to
boarding school tomorrow, huh?

Hey, how about that
merger, huh, Bill?

173
00:11:58,821 --> 00:11:59,995
Don't worry about the merger.

174
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:00,927
It's fine.

175
00:12:00,961 --> 00:12:02,100
I'm not worried about it.

176
00:12:02,135 --> 00:12:03,964
In fact, I'm thinking
about putting more in.

177
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:05,863
And I think you should
too because we're going

178
00:12:05,897 --> 00:12:07,243
to have a great fourth quarter.

179
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:08,279
All right.

180
00:12:08,313 --> 00:12:09,452
All right, Matthew, I'm in.

181
00:12:12,317 --> 00:12:13,767
That went well.

182
00:12:13,802 --> 00:12:14,216
Yeah.

Because if you're going
to shower, hurry up.

186
00:12:41,312 --> 00:12:44,384
You've got to do it now because
we've got a lot of work to do.

187
00:12:44,418 --> 00:12:45,212

372
00:23:49,082 --> 00:23:49,911
OK.

373
00:23:49,945 --> 00:23:53,397
How about four of
these for a plate?

374
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,640
Right on.

375
00:23:54,674 --> 00:23:55,606
Have a great show, man.

376
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:56,262
Thank you.

377
00:23:56,296 --> 00:23:59,438
Here, Kev.

378
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:01,267
Cool.

379
00:24:01,301 --> 00:24:02,786
Somebody give me a hand here.

380
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,545
Oh, let me help you.

381
00:24:13,486 --> 00:24:14,038
How's that?

382
00:24:14,073 --> 00:24:14,660
It works.

383
00:24:14,694 --> 00:24:15,143
Yeah?

384

Thanks.

So what do you guys do?

386
00:24:19,112 --> 00:24:22,253
I mean, do you guys camp
out here or what happens?

387
00:24:22,288 --> 00:24:25,222
How many shows have you been to?

388
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:28,570
Actually, this is my first show.

389

Ah.

Ah.

391
00:24:29,882 --> 00:24:34,024
Now, that's an enviable
position to be in.

392
00:24:34,058 --> 00:24:35,646
I'm going to take a
spin around the lot

393
00:24:35,681 --> 00:24:37,441
and try to get some tickets.

394

Want to come, Simon?

395
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,547
Actually, you know what?

396
00:24:39,581 --> 00:24:43,654
I really need to stay
around and look for Andrew.

397
00:24:43,689 --> 00:24:45,587
All right, suit yourself.

398
00:24:45,622 --> 00:24:48,245
Well, if you're
going for a minute.

We got lots of cool shirts--

407
00:25:08,576 --> 00:25:11,510
Wow, this place is great.

408
00:25:18,344 --> 00:25:19,000
What's up?

Hey, Trace, my man.

I can't handle that anymore.

Double bionic hydroponic
ganja goofballs.

425
00:26:21,649 --> 00:26:24,790
Hey, you want to buy
a ganja goofball, man?

426
00:26:24,824 --> 00:26:26,964
I don't want to be rude,
but those look like somebody

428
00:26:27,931 --> 00:26:30,278
What are you talking about, man?

429
00:26:30,312 --> 00:26:31,728
Wait, hold up.

430
00:26:31,762 --> 00:26:33,350
Let me get two of those, bro.

431
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:34,247
Right on.

432

I don't know, man.

433
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:42,290
Thanks, bro.

You should hang with
us for a few months.

It's not possible, man.

441
00:27:20,052 --> 00:27:21,260
It is possible.

442
00:27:21,294 --> 00:27:23,227
Anything is possible.

Good.

Good to see you, man.

Simon, how are you?

458
00:27:52,774 --> 00:27:53,672
How are you doing?

459
00:27:53,706 --> 00:27:54,362
Nice to meet you.

460
00:27:54,396 --> 00:27:55,225
Nice to meet you too.

461
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:56,951
And you know Trace.

462
00:27:56,985 --> 00:27:58,366
Hey, Trace, what's kicking?

463
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,298
Hey, you, baby.

464
00:27:59,332 --> 00:28:00,368
Just you, baby.

465
00:28:00,402 --> 00:28:01,403
Oh.

466
00:28:01,438 --> 00:28:04,786
Oh, Jason, I got a
question for you.

467
00:28:04,821 --> 00:28:08,963
Should Simon go on tour
for the rest of his life?

468
00:28:08,997 --> 00:28:12,000
Well, what stands in the way?

469
00:28:12,035 --> 00:28:13,001
Boarding school.

470
00:28:13,036 --> 00:28:14,416
Ooh, I see.

471
00:28:29,328 --> 00:28:31,744
Definitely tour, bro.

472
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:33,125
Yeah, but how do you know?

473
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:36,197
Because I graduated
from Andover last year

474
00:28:36,231 --> 00:28:38,440
and I still managed
to see 30 shows

00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:41,650
Look at this guy.

00:28:41,685 --> 00:28:43,929
Would this man lie to you?

478
00:28:43,963 --> 00:28:46,103
No, definitely not.

479
00:28:46,138 --> 00:28:46,897
Definitely not.

480
00:28:46,932 --> 00:28:49,451
Thanks, Jason.

00:28:49,486 --> 00:28:53,007
Simon, I'll see you around.

482
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:54,560
All right.

483
00:28:54,594 --> 00:28:55,181

Mm-hmm.

00:29:55,207 --> 00:29:56,346
Bathroom looks pretty good.

487
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:02,973
Surprised you, didn't we?

488
00:30:07,633 --> 00:30:11,533
Simon, there is no
smoking in this room.

489
00:30:11,568 --> 00:30:12,638
I don't smoke.

490
00:30:12,672 --> 00:30:15,917
Allow me to finish, please.

00:30:15,952 --> 00:30:17,677
In case you haven't
heard already from Joe,

492
00:30:17,712 --> 00:30:20,094
this is his third time here.

493
00:30:20,128 --> 00:30:24,615
Joe, tell Simon why we had to
ask you to leave twice before.

494
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:27,273
I was smoking in the room.

495
00:30:27,308 --> 00:30:28,481
That's right.

496
00:30:28,516 --> 00:30:31,657
Now tell him why you came back.

497
00:30:31,691 --> 00:30:32,796
I'm an alcoholic.

498
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,695
That means I have an
obsession of the mind coupled

499
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,214
with an allergy of the body.

500
00:30:37,249 --> 00:30:38,871
And I'm here to get
better and learn

501
00:30:38,906 --> 00:30:40,459
how to stop drinking
one day at a time.

502

00:30:56,716 --> 00:30:58,926
you'll both be thrown out.

508
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,582
Am I perfectly clear?

509
00:31:00,617 --> 00:31:01,480
Yes, Ms Matthews.

I didn't do anything.

get it through to you

before you kill yourself.

00:31:23,157 --> 00:31:25,987
So listen up.

sanity are directly

self honesty you can develop.

Simon, do you know about
state-dependent thinking?

543
00:33:07,744 --> 00:33:11,092
What's that?

544
00:33:11,127 --> 00:33:15,303
It's like this
psychological concept

545
00:33:15,338 --> 00:33:20,584
where if you're all baked when
you're studying something,

546
00:33:20,619 --> 00:33:24,933
in order to remember it, you
have to totally be baked again.

as I'm good and baked when

going to totally kick ass.

be distracted right now.

Don't you dare speak
to us that way.

In your most frail gesture
are things which enclose me.

you open always petal

00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:39,268
I forgot the rest.

But the last night is,
nobody, not even the rain,

777
00:51:49,865 --> 00:51:52,523
has such small hands.

00:59:57,421 --> 01:00:01,494
but I got to catch a
plane in 90 minutes.

926
01:00:01,528 --> 01:00:02,909
OK?

927
01:00:02,944 --> 01:00:03,669
Lauren?

928
01:00:03,703 --> 01:00:04,911
No, no, it's not OK.

929
01:00:04,946 --> 01:00:06,085
Where's my package, Lauren?

930
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:06,948
Where are you going?

931
01:00:06,982 --> 01:00:08,501
I'm going out with my friends.

932
01:00:08,535 --> 01:00:09,744
Don't tell me you're going to
spend the rest of your life

933
01:00:09,778 --> 01:00:10,710
with those people.

934
01:00:10,745 --> 01:00:12,194
I'm not talking about
the rest of my life.

935
01:00:12,229 --> 01:00:13,644
Those people are going
absolutely nowhere.

936
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:15,335
Know what, I'm closer
with those people

937
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:16,474
than I'll ever be with you.

01:00:16,509 --> 01:00:19,098
Oh, Simon, you don't mean that.

939
01:00:19,132 --> 01:00:20,824
I'm going to San
Francisco today.

940
01:00:20,858 --> 01:00:21,997
OK?

941
01:00:22,032 --> 01:00:24,586
Maybe for the summer, maybe
for longer, I don't know.

942
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:25,691
But I'm going.

943
01:00:25,725 --> 01:00:27,900
Well, you better think about
that before you walk out

944
01:00:27,934 --> 01:00:32,180
the door because that's
a serious decision.

945
01:00:32,214 --> 01:00:33,457
All right?

946
01:00:33,491 --> 01:00:37,288
We'll just open this package
now, and then we'll all know.

947
01:00:42,811 --> 01:00:44,295
Allow me to open.

948
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:46,677
I hope--

949
01:00:46,712 --> 01:00:47,713
Stop it, both of you.

01:00:47,747 --> 01:00:48,161
Simon!

951
01:00:55,203 --> 01:00:56,169

953
01:01:17,121 --> 01:01:20,055
Just open it up.

954
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:20,573
Open it.

955
01:01:20,607 --> 01:01:21,091
OK.

956
01:01:21,125 --> 01:01:21,367
Open it.

01:01:21,401 --> 01:01:21,850
OK.

958
01:01:21,885 --> 01:01:24,404

It's a combination

Dude, it was just
a wake up call.

966
01:01:46,633 --> 01:01:47,393
And a gift.

It's a fucking gift, man.

No, no, no.

971
01:01:54,227 --> 01:01:55,194
It's just my parents.

972

They thought it was drugs.

No, just singles.

get rid of pages.

me a sheet to pass around,

1110
01:09:35,654 --> 01:09:38,035
Doc is involved as we speak.

1111
01:09:54,293 --> 01:09:56,226
Hey, what's up, doc?

1112
01:09:56,261 --> 01:09:57,296
What?

1113
01:09:57,331 --> 01:09:59,712
This is my friend, Simon.

1114
01:09:59,747 --> 01:10:01,300

1115
01:10:01,335 --> 01:10:01,749
What?

1116
01:10:06,236 --> 01:10:06,650
Neil.

1117
01:10:13,657 --> 01:10:15,970
Neil, how many
times have we talked

1118
01:10:16,004 --> 01:10:17,730
about this neurotic
whispering shit?

1119
01:10:17,765 --> 01:10:18,214
Well--

1120
01:10:21,251 --> 01:10:25,738
Whenever you whisper, you
make everything very tense.

1121
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:34,333
And there's enough
tension as it is.

1122
01:10:34,368 --> 01:10:35,576
OK?

1123
01:10:35,610 --> 01:10:36,059
OK.

1124
01:10:49,175 --> 01:10:49,969
You're done?

1125
01:10:50,004 --> 01:10:51,385
This is my friend, Simon Harris.

1126
01:10:51,419 --> 01:10:52,524
The one I was telling you about.

1127
01:10:52,558 --> 01:10:53,007
Oh, yes.

1128
01:10:57,701 --> 01:10:59,496
Are you ready to
go see how you do?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

1130
01:11:21,311 --> 01:11:24,625
Do you know what that is?

1131
01:11:24,659 --> 01:11:27,731
Scott Joplin, Maple Leaf Rag.

1132
01:11:27,766 --> 01:11:29,664
Very good.

1133
01:11:29,699 --> 01:11:31,666
Trace, how do you like
your Bloody Marys?

1134
01:11:31,701 --> 01:11:33,599
To tell you the truth,
doc, I'm kind of scared

1135
01:11:33,634 --> 01:11:35,946
of the goddamn things.

1136
01:11:35,981 --> 01:11:37,569
Well, let me give it a try.

1137
01:11:51,376 --> 01:11:53,447
It's a good batch.

1138
01:11:53,481 --> 01:11:58,728
Now I'm going to play
a particular verse

1139
01:11:58,762 --> 01:11:59,729
of Brown-eyed Women.

1140
01:11:59,763 --> 01:12:00,661
I want you to hear this.

1141
01:12:05,804 --> 01:12:09,946

he stepped to the bar,

1142
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:15,020

of the whiskey jar.

1143
01:12:15,054 --> 01:12:20,819
1930 when the wall caved
in, he made his way

1144
01:12:20,853 --> 01:12:24,926
selling red-eyed gin.

1145
01:12:24,961 --> 01:12:27,895
Yeah.

1146
01:12:27,929 --> 01:12:30,207
Who wrote that?

1147
01:12:30,242 --> 01:12:33,866
Robert Hunter wrote the words,
and Jerry put it to music.

1148
01:12:37,491 --> 01:12:40,735
That's exactly right.

1149
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:42,358
But I don't know
if you're making

1150
01:12:42,392 --> 01:12:44,808
the connections, young man.

1151
01:12:44,843 --> 01:12:48,398
Now what are they talking
about in this tune?

1152
01:12:48,433 --> 01:12:51,194
They're basically
talking about partying

1153
01:12:51,228 --> 01:12:54,784
in the roaring 20s and the
Great Depression of the 30s.

1154
01:12:54,818 --> 01:12:55,371
Yes.

1155
01:12:55,405 --> 01:12:56,164
Yes, yes.

1156
01:12:56,199 --> 01:12:57,131
Yes!

1157
01:12:57,165 --> 01:12:59,513
It's about America's
past, but it's also

1158
01:12:59,547 --> 01:13:01,066
about our mythological past.

1159
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:03,482
It's also about our present.

1160
01:13:03,517 --> 01:13:08,038
About the intoxication of
high times and the depression

1161
01:13:08,073 --> 01:13:11,525
that accompanies the comedown.

1162
01:13:11,559 --> 01:13:14,769
It's like a universal
thing, really.

1163
01:13:14,804 --> 01:13:17,082
Oh, you're a bright boy.

1164
01:13:17,116 --> 01:13:20,465
But do you see the
real genius of this?

1165
01:13:20,499 --> 01:13:25,021
Scott Joplin played Maple Leaf
Rag at the turn of the century.

1166
01:13:25,055 --> 01:13:30,613
Robert Hunter wrote Brown-eyed
Women in the early '70s.

1167
01:13:30,647 --> 01:13:33,719
They were talking about
universal themes that

1168
01:13:33,754 --> 01:13:36,273
have no temporal limitations.

1169
01:13:36,308 --> 01:13:39,069
And they're hiding them
right there for us to find.

1170
01:13:39,104 --> 01:13:40,588
Right there in
our own mythology.

1171
01:13:40,623 --> 01:13:43,039
Right there for anyone to see.

1172
01:13:43,073 --> 01:13:46,042
Now everybody can see.

1173
01:13:46,076 --> 01:13:47,906
Because they haven't
taken my LSD.

1174
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:07,132
1943, the physicist
was playing tennis

1175
01:14:07,166 --> 01:14:10,066
and came up with a recipe
for nuclear fission,

1176
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:13,656
the first atomic bomb.

1177
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:17,660
Thousands of miles away in
Switzerland, Dr. Albert Hofmann

1178
01:14:17,694 --> 01:14:21,387
was tripping his face off
because he accidentally

1179
01:14:21,422 --> 01:14:28,774
ingested a tiny amount of
his new discovery, LSD 25.

1180
01:14:28,809 --> 01:14:35,367
LSD will do to you
whatever LSD wants to.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

1182
01:14:39,751 --> 01:14:40,821
Pay attention.

1183
01:14:48,207 --> 01:14:49,001
Very well.

1184
01:15:01,358 --> 01:15:03,533
I want you to put your hands
face down on your knees,

1185
01:15:03,568 --> 01:15:05,190
be quiet, and listen.

1186
01:15:05,224 --> 01:15:07,641
Don't make any gestures or
respond to anything at all.

1187
01:15:11,817 --> 01:15:13,474
Simon, tell Joe what
you think of him.

1188
01:15:17,409 --> 01:15:19,169
What did you say to her?

1189
01:15:19,204 --> 01:15:20,343
I didn't tell her anything.

your hands on your knees.

to make it out there?

Kate, I don't want to do this.

1194
01:15:30,422 --> 01:15:33,356
Simon, I want you to look
at Joe and find the courage

1195
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:35,738
to tell him what
you see because I

1196
01:15:35,772 --> 01:15:37,843
don't know if he's
got the ability

1197
01:15:37,878 --> 01:15:38,775
to see that for himself.

1198
01:15:50,028 --> 01:15:52,202
Joe, you believe if everybody
thinks things are OK,

01:15:52,237 --> 01:15:53,410
everything's going to be cool?

It's like you told me.

You're only in here
'cause you got caught,

1202

and if you didn't get caught,
there wouldn't be a problem.

You know, you're supposed
to be in here for your wife

1204
01:16:06,665 --> 01:16:08,978
and for your kids and for
your family and so forth,

1205
01:16:09,012 --> 01:16:10,151
but, you know, what about you?

01:16:13,948 --> 01:16:16,641
Aren't you tired of
living for other people?

01:16:20,714 --> 01:16:21,300
I am.

fucking relief until you learn

So will you get a chance to see
your parents while you're here?

01:20:44,943 --> 01:20:45,979
Actually I'm
thinking we're going

to head up there

it by herself.

Good job.

1285
01:21:53,356 --> 01:21:55,876
Yeah.

1286
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:58,844
So how long are you two
going to be in New York?

1287
01:21:58,879 --> 01:22:01,330
I read in The Times this morning
that the concerts are going

1288
01:22:01,364 --> 01:22:02,883
to be here through Thursday.

1289
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:04,989
We'd love it if you'd stay
with us for the weekend.

1290
01:22:05,023 --> 01:22:06,507
Yeah, we have some
time this weekend.

1291
01:22:06,542 --> 01:22:07,681
We've got plenty of room.

1292
01:22:07,715 --> 01:22:10,787
I don't think so.

1293
01:22:10,822 --> 01:22:13,998
Well, maybe we could
work something out.

1294
01:22:14,032 --> 01:22:15,654
That'd be great.

1295
01:22:15,689 --> 01:22:18,312
I spell it out for you, guys.

1296
01:22:18,347 --> 01:22:20,521
I don't want to stay
here this weekend.

1297
01:22:20,556 --> 01:22:24,111
We're not going to stay
here this weekend, really.

01:22:32,671 --> 01:22:34,950

1302
01:22:42,302 --> 01:22:43,510

You know what, let's not
pretend that things are OK

01:22:48,618 --> 01:22:51,587
'cause the last time I was here,
you guys fucking kicked me out.

1307
01:22:51,621 --> 01:22:53,106
I didn't throw you out.

1308

You walked out the
door on your own.

1309

pulled into this.

You know he'll never love
you like he love my mom.

1313

That's all right, Lauren.

off and be ready for dessert?

What is your problem?

1322
01:23:33,629 --> 01:23:36,114
I think maybe we should go.

1323
01:23:36,149 --> 01:23:37,219
Now we're going to go.

1324
01:23:37,253 --> 01:23:37,978
We're going to go.

01:23:44,812 --> 01:23:46,469
I'm sorry.

Please call if you need
anything, Jennifer.

1330

It's nice to see
you again, Jennifer.

For any reason.

Will you slow down?

1333
01:23:59,793 --> 01:24:02,589
So what did you
think of my family?

1334
01:24:02,623 --> 01:24:04,970
Simon, your dad was trying.

1335
01:24:05,005 --> 01:24:07,835
You saw the way he looked at me.

1336
01:24:07,870 --> 01:24:09,354
He didn't believe
me for one second.

1337
01:24:09,389 --> 01:24:12,840
Not one second
did he believe me.

1338
01:24:12,875 --> 01:24:13,669
You're lying.

1339
01:24:13,703 --> 01:24:15,015
It's not the point.

1340
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:18,846
The point is if I wasn't lying,
he still wouldn't believe me.

1341
01:24:18,881 --> 01:24:19,778
But you were lying.

1342
01:24:22,919 --> 01:24:24,921
What was that shit at
the dinner table, huh?

1343
01:24:24,956 --> 01:24:27,924
I'm sorry, Mr. Harris?

Jennifer, what
are you sorry for?

1345
01:24:31,963 --> 01:24:33,344
What is your problem?

1346
01:24:36,588 --> 01:24:38,694
I think you just keep your
suggestions to yourself,

1347
01:24:38,728 --> 01:24:40,592
you know, 'cause
I don't need them.

1348
01:24:40,627 --> 01:24:43,354

want to hear me now.

great idea, Simon.

1351

I don't even know
who you are anymore.

you're selling drugs,

you'd like to share with Simon?

1460
01:31:34,592 --> 01:31:36,214
I certainly knew
about all the drugs,

1461
01:31:36,249 --> 01:31:41,288
and I'm happy that he's able
to admit to these things.

1462
01:31:41,323 --> 01:31:42,842
I'm sure it's not easy.

1463
01:31:42,876 --> 01:31:44,429
Why are you talking to me?

1464
01:31:44,464 --> 01:31:44,982
talk to Simon.

1465
01:31:52,576 --> 01:32:03,207
I look forward to you coming
home so that we can take care

1466
01:32:03,241 --> 01:32:07,970
of all of this by ourselves.

1467
01:32:08,005 --> 01:32:10,663
Is there anything you
would change if you

1468
01:32:10,697 --> 01:32:12,596
could do it all over again?

1469
01:32:12,630 --> 01:32:14,598
Well, I'm sure
everybody's got things

1470
01:32:14,632 --> 01:32:15,599
they would like to change.

1471
01:32:21,259 --> 01:32:23,986
Everybody makes mistakes.

1472
01:32:24,021 --> 01:32:25,298
Dad, what mistakes did you make?

1473
01:32:25,332 --> 01:32:26,679
Simon, be quiet.

1474
01:32:26,713 --> 01:32:29,095
No, that's-- it's
all right, Kate.

1475
01:32:29,129 --> 01:32:39,208
I-- I suppose I could
have been a better father.

1476
01:32:39,243 --> 01:32:42,902
And a better husband
to mom, right?

1477
01:32:42,936 --> 01:32:45,180
What?

1478
01:32:45,214 --> 01:32:47,907
Do you want me to say it?

1479
01:32:47,941 --> 01:32:51,013

I'll deny it.

It's absolutely not true.

telling you here?

Simon, sit down.

they don't cheat, dad.

don't treat you right either.

made mistakes here.

so desperately for your mother

Simon told the truth in there.

Well, I don't know what
he's been telling you here.

So why does Simon think that?

1537
01:36:06,381 --> 01:36:18,220
You know Simon's mother died,
and it affected all of us.
