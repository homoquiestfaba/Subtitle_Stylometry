Another?

146
00:08:19,055 --> 00:08:22,056
The naming of cats

147
00:08:22,058 --> 00:08:24,792
is a difficult matter.

148
00:08:24,794 --> 00:08:28,763
It isn't just
one of your holiday games.

149
00:08:28,765 --> 00:08:32,834
You may think at first
I'm as mad as a hatter

150
00:08:32,836 --> 00:08:37,038
when I tell you a cat must
have three different names.

151
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,273
First of all,

152
00:08:38,275 --> 00:08:40,208
there's the name
that the family use daily,

153
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,276
such as...

154
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:43,077
- Peter.
- Augustus.

155
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:45,280
- Alonzo.
- Or James.

156
00:08:45,282 --> 00:08:49,250
But I tell you a cat needs
a name that's particular.

157
00:08:49,252 --> 00:08:53,087
A name that's peculiar
and more dignified.

158
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:54,923
CHORUS (in unison):
Else how can he keep up

159
00:08:54,925 --> 00:08:57,025
his tail perpendicular?

160
00:08:57,027 --> 00:08:58,960
Or spread out his whiskers?

161
00:08:58,962 --> 00:09:00,895
Or cherish his pride?

162
00:09:00,897 --> 00:09:02,830
But above and beyond,

163
00:09:02,832 --> 00:09:05,133
there's still
one name left over.

164
00:09:05,135 --> 00:09:07,969
And that is the name
that you never will guess.

165
00:09:07,971 --> 00:09:12,073
The name that no human research
can discover,

166
00:09:12,075 --> 00:09:16,010
but the cat herself knows
and will never confess.

167
00:09:16,012 --> 00:09:20,248
When you notice a cat
in profound meditation,

168
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,551
the reason, I tell you,
is always the same.

169
00:09:23,553 --> 00:09:25,253
Her mind is engaged

170
00:09:25,255 --> 00:09:28,957
in a rapt contemplation
of the thought,

171
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,260
of the thought, of the thought

172
00:09:32,262 --> 00:09:34,195
of her name.

173
00:09:34,197 --> 00:09:36,297
