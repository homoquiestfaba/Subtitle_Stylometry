This guy Kane, he heard shots.

203

He runs to the front
of the church. He sees
your brother lying there.

204
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,552
There's a gun.
He picks it up.

205

You burst through the doors.
He thinks you're the gunman.

Wait. He thinks
I'm the gunman?
Let me finish!

207
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:21,162
He thought you were the gunman
who was gonna come back
and kill him, so he ran.

208
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,732
That's if he admits he was in
the church in the first place. He hasn't.

209

The priest didn't see anything.
There's no corroborating witnesses.

210

There's no fingerprints
on the gun.

It's your word against his.

212
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:39,255
He's about to tell me that
the guy that shot my brother
is gonna get away.

213
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:42,316
He's the lawyer.
Would you excuse us?

214
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,555
I want to talk
to Kuffs alone.

Yeah.

I pulled your brother's file.
He left you his district.

220

No.

00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:24,523
Was that you
on the phone?

648
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:27,536
Yeah. Yeah,
that was me.

649
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:34,538
George! George, come on!
You're getting a hard-on.

650
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:36,977
I can't help it. It's you.

651
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:41,541
- No, it's you.
- Yeah.

652
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:45,384
Uh, look, what are you doing
with this Robbie character?

653
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:48,856
Kuffs, come on.
You left me.

654
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,917
Yeah, right.

655
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:57,734
Does he, uh...
Does he know about the child?

656
00:48:57,801 --> 00:49:03,000
You know, I don't need Robert
and I don't need you.

657
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:10,038
I've got to go.
I just wanted to see
if you were all right.

658
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:13,739
Take care of yourself.

659
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:31,257
Women.

660
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:38,368
Well, Capt. Morino wouldn't
give me the search warrant
for the laundry.

661
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:44,813
Ted got suspended.
He doesn't know that yet.
He's still asleep.

662
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:47,145
I don't know, maybe it's just
the post-gunshot blues,

663
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:51,517
but I'm beginning to feel like
I'm not exactly cut out for
this line of work, you know?

664
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:55,456
[Sighs]

665
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:59,757
Want to see what a gunshot
wound looks like?
[Groaning]

666
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:03,027
Gotta say my point of view
on guns has changed.

667
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,263
Do cause
quite a bit of pain.

668
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,531
<i>[Dog Barking]</i>
See, the, uh, bullet
went in here...

669
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:10,869
and then it came out the back.

670
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:15,436
You feel it hit, and then
there's this, uh,

671
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:18,572
this kind of a sharp pain.

672
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:22,243
And then it goes numb.
Yeah.

673
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,310
Scarier than shit.

674
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:30,457
Now, the guy who jumped,
he was a, uh, a writer.

675
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:35,521
Ooh! Tried to kill himself
twice before.

676
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,227
[Sighing]
I don't know.

677
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:43,204
I know Kane killed my brother.
I know Sam Jones is in it with him.

678
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:46,298
What the hell can I do about it?

679
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,611
I don't have any money.

680
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,148
In two weeks, I'm probably
gonna lose the business
anyway.

681
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:56,413
There's this $50,000
balloon payment due
on change of ownership...

682
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:59,580
that Capt. Morino
hasn't spotted yet.

683
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:02,648
That's it, that's it.
I'm doomed.

684
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:20,266
If you're not the cleaning lady,
you're in the wrong apartment.

685
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:24,541
[Laughing]
I've come to make peace,
Mr. Kuffs.

686
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:29,179
<i>I'm sorry you think</i>
<i>I killed your brother.</i>

687
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:34,519
I didn't, but I do represent
certain business interests
in your district.

688
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,821
There's a $25,000
down payment for your services.

689
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:43,889
Most of the time,
all we'll ask you to do
is look the other way.

690
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:47,403
You took your brother's job,
Mr. Kuffs.

691
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:49,462
You could have a future here.

692
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,042
Then again,
you might not.

693
00:51:57,747 --> 00:51:59,374
[Whistles]

694
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:06,045
[Sighing]
I think I like having a future.

695
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:10,850
Thank you, Lee.

696
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:25,767
Aah!
We're gonna die, Sam!

697
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:28,709
Oh, I scared you,
didn't I? [Cackles]

698
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:30,712
You're in big trouble, kid.

699
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:34,739
Sam, I gotta tell ya.
I was pretty set to quit
the business this morning.

700
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,343
Then your little buddy, Kane,
dropped by, offered me a bribe...

701
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:41,618
$25,000 to look the other way
while you tear up my district.

702
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:45,525
I asked for 50,000.
We settled on 37,500.
I think I did pretty good.

703
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:48,962
Capt. Morino, please.
It's Sam Jones.
It's an emergency.

704
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:51,500
Police? I'd better
talk fast, huh?

705
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:54,560
You're into a
land-grab scam, Sam.

706
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:56,629
Now, the problem is,
you're greedy!

707
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:59,641
You don't want to pay
top dollar, and people don't
actually want to sell to you.

708
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:02,701
So you use Kane and his hoods
to come in, shake everybody up...

709
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:07,148
and then you come in like
a savior with bags of money
and buy everything up!

710
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:09,310
See, I did a little
research on you.

711
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:11,479
You're a big shot
art collector,

712
00:53:11,555 --> 00:53:13,819
a major player
on the charity circuit.

713
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:16,381
You're rich, so you think
you're above the law.

714
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:18,552
But you've made
two mistakes now, Sam.

715
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:20,687
Number one, you had Kane
kill my brother.

716
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:24,928
Number two, the land
you're grabbing happens
to be in my district.

717
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:28,437
And in my district, Sambo,
I am the law.

718
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:31,235
Capt. Morino, one of your
patrol specials...

719
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:34,243
just broke into my car
and is threatening me.

720
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:38,304
George Kuffs.
He wants to talk to you.

721
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,815
[Morino, Indistinct]
Naw,
I don't think so.

722
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:45,878
<i>[Hangs Up Receiver]</i>
It's just you and me, Sam.
No corroborating witnesses.

723
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:49,949
Your word against mine.
Pull over right here, huh?
I'll walk the rest of the way.

724
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:56,097
I wish there were something
I could say, Mr. Kuffs,

725
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:58,361
to make you feel better
about yourself.

726
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:00,926
[Sighs]

727
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:04,804
I guess you could tell me
you're gonna leave town
for 200 or 300 years.

728
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:06,865
That'd make me feel
a little better.

729
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:10,836
Thank you.

730
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:18,854
Oh, God,
that felt good!

731
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:25,621
I almost told him I knew about
him and Kane and the laundry.

732
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:27,629
What if there were drugs
in that tube or something?

733
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:32,532
What he doesn't know I know
can hurt him, so why the hell
should I tell him, huh?

734
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:36,595
Yeah, you see,
this way I can stake him
and Kane out with my team.

735
00:54:36,673 --> 00:54:38,732
I can catch them both
red-handed!

736
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:40,969
I like it.
It sounds good.

737
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:42,807
[Chattering]

738
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:45,006
[Jingles]

739
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:48,847
Guess what I have in the bag?
Capt. Morino wants you
to call him right away.

740
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:54,581
He sounded
really pissed off.
Yeah, in a minute.

741
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:56,592
Hey, guys,
what's going on?

742
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:58,753
Nothing personal, George,

743
00:54:58,828 --> 00:55:00,989
but we all decided we don't
want you as our boss.

744
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:03,624
[Scoffs]
Well, this is a first.

745
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,965
A boss being fired by
his own employees.

746
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:10,097
Tell me, Bill, who do you think
should be boss, my little friend?

747
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:12,164
Me.

748
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:16,076
Nothing personal, Bill,
but, uh, you're fired.

749
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,876
You can't fire me.
These people want me.

750
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:22,179
<i>We're not saying you can't own</i>
<i>the business, we're saying...</i>

751
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:25,016
find somebody else
with experience to run it!

752
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:27,784
Is that what
you're saying?
<i>That's right.</i>

753
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:31,315
Well, listen.
Since I have taken this job,
I've been shouted at,

754
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:33,521
I've been bribed,
I've even been shot
for you people!

755
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:37,760
And now you're telling me
you don't believe in me?
This is what we're gonna do.

756
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,632
If Bill beats me in
a fair fight right here, right now,

757
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:43,468
<i>not only can Bill be boss...</i>

758
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,474
I'll give you the business for free.

759
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:47,305
- What do you say?
- You're not serious?

760
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:51,746
Yeah, I am.
But I gotta warn you,
I'm pretty good.

761
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:56,218
<i>So if I win, I'm boss.</i>

762
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:59,813
<i>If I sayjump, your only answer</i>
<i>is "how high. '"</i>

763
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:02,881
You're on.
Come on, Bill.

764
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:07,123
He was Golden Glove champion
twice, George. Forget it.

765
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,563
Hey, a deal's a deal.
You can't back out now.

766
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:12,624
All right, just
make it quick, Bill.

767
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:15,330
- You won't feel a thing.
- Thank you.

768
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:18,772
Ooh!
[Gasping]

769
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:25,079
I win!

770
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:29,847
Why didn't I think of that
last night with Ted?

771
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:35,817
Okay, that'll be $113.65.

772
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:39,020
All right.
What would you like
the card to say?

773
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:41,029
Ah, "Dear Maya,

774
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:44,396
"it was great seeing you
the other night.

775
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:48,665
Love and kisses on
all your pink parts. George."

776
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:51,764
I guess you hear that
all the time, don't you?
[Harriet] Come in, George.

777
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:54,435
Excuse me.

778
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:57,946
Yeah, come in. Ten-four.

779
00:56:58,014 --> 00:57:00,881
[Harriet, Loud]
I got Bill on the line, and
Morino's called twice more.

780
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:04,010
You better call him soon.
Now, here's Bill.

781
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:08,888
Just checkin' in, boss. Sam Jones
got home 15 minutes ago.

782
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,028
[In High Voice]
Hasn't moved since.

783
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:17,123
All right. Why don't
you just call me back
in about a half hour?

784
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:21,759
May I ask you
a personal question?
Sure.

785
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:24,033
Have you ever, uh,
been married?

786
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,200
[Chuckles]
Goin' on 18 years.

787
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:30,303
Eighteen years.
Geez!

788
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:32,507
What's it like?

789
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:34,880
Is it still fun?
You still like her?

790
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,249
- Him.
- Oh.

791
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:41,586
Yeah, it's great. It has
its ups and downs, but it's great.

792
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,724
- Thank you.
- Sure.

793
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:50,994
<i>Have a nice day.</i>
You too.

794
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:53,001
When do you think
she'll get these?

795
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:56,869
Well, I'll call Sacramento right away.
Say, by 2:00?

796
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,999
[Beeping]
[Nikki On Radio]
George, are you there?

797
00:57:59,075 --> 00:58:01,066
I think I want to
change the card.

798
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:04,113
Yeah, come in.
I lost Kane.

799
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:08,014
He turned a corner
and I turned the corner,
and he just wasn't there.

800
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:11,542
I'm sorry, George.
I'm not very good at this.

801
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:14,590
That's quite all right, Nikki.
I have a good idea where he's going.

802
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:18,616
Why don't you go hang out
by the laundry or something?

803
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:24,095
Hey, wait! Weren't you
gonna change the card?

804
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,567

you asking Mr. Chang
to sell his business.

to ask you to leave.

I paid you this morning.
Absolutely.

You hired me to protect
your interests, and I
fully intend to do that.

I also have a deal
with Mr. Chang.

And right now, you're on
his property. That's why
I have to ask you to leave.

were on your property...

832

and he was leaning on you,
I'd ask him to leave.

833

And then, if he didn't
do it fast enough,

834
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:03,923
I'd pull my gun
out of its holster
just like this...

835
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,298
and I would shout,
"Do we have
an understanding...

or do you want to see
if you can breathe
through your forehead?"

But I don't have to do that
with you, Kane, because
we're pals, aren't we?

<i>In the cold</i>
<i>Hey</i>

1301
01:39:44,078 --> 01:39:48,947
<i>I don't want to live without you</i>

1302
01:39:50,117 --> 01:39:54,952
<i>Oh, no I won't walk away</i>

<i>Nobody, nobody</i>
<i>I won't walk away</i>

1311
