178
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,101
People think that there is a good,
easy, clean, fast way to do it.

179
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,393
But there isn't.

180
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:20,232
I mean, there is good, easy and fast,
but never clean and it's tough.

181
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,526
No matter how many times you have done it.

182
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:26,488
I just wish, when I was done with them,
they would just disappear.

183
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,490
I don't know.

184
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,700
Maybe I shouldn't go through with this.

185
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,494
It has been so long.

186
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,496
I am standing here,
second guessing my shoes,

187
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:38,500
when no man has ever walked away
because of a woman's shoes.

188
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,545
Why do we get dressed up like this at all?

189
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,756
The guy never cares.

190
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:45,965
Never.

191
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:50,470
I mean, yeah, if you show up to an expensive
dinner in an oversized Mickey Mouse sweat shirt,

192
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,514
he might shy away.

193
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,516
I just mean, within reason.

194
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:59,187
You think a guy ever goes back to his
buddies and says “She was nice, but damn bro,

195
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,523
those Louboutins were a boner killer”.

196
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,233
Not fucking likely.

197
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,695
I am nervous.

198
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:07,654
Me?

199
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:08,864
Nervous?

200
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,574
Of this?

already made the decision, this morning.

Got a whole fucking tub of wing,

213
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,431
so I ain't really that hungry anyway.

214
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:35,681

223
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,787

she should come to his office, each day.

So she does.

she can't even put her makeup on.

each male technician in the city”.

if we order pineapple pizza.

Yeah.

285
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,746
Pineapple pizza is my favorite.

on pizza, Jay Daughter?

maybe when she comes back,

295
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,482
I will ask her.

[Footsteps approaching]

297
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,737

One large with double pineapple.

299
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:28,743
I wanted to ask you something.

300
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:30,662
Okay. Shoot.

301
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:34,833
Actually, Jay Daughter wanted to know...

302
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,169
What? It is your idea.

303
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:39,228
Wait.

304
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,672
Jay Daughter talks?

305
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,590
I thought she is mute.

306
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:44,717
She is.

307
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:48,388
She uses Morse alphabet to communicate.

308
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,140
I am sorry, Alphabet what?

309
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,601
Morse. Alphabet.

310
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:57,856
You see, she blinks to me
and I read what she says.

311
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,817
Fucking amazing. Can I try?

312
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:07,782
[Woman blinks]

313
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,618
She said there is no such word.

314
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:14,831
I blinked like a hundred times,
it must mean something.

315
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,791
What did you say?

316
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,878
I asked her why her name is Jay Daughter.

317
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,838
I still don't get it.

318
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:26,092
Her father was a Jason,
so her name is Jay daughter.

319
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,803
I thought you would know by now.

320
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:30,346
Okay.

321
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:31,973
I did not know that.

322
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,265
I know now.

323
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:37,353
You actually need to learn this language.
Just like any other language.

324
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,104
Hmmm.

325
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,900
Fuck it, then.
What did she want to know?

326
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:46,487
She wanted to know why your brother…

327
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,198
why your brother didn't kill Laurient.

328
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:54,495
For so many years she seemed to be
unbeatable, untouchable, unbreakable.

329
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:55,871
Shit,

330
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,583
I knew this question would
pop out sooner than later.

331
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,628
Don't answer if you don't want to.

332
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,718
I told you she gets upset.

333
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:11,679
No, I am good.

334
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,515
You are my best friends
and you deserve to know.

335
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:20,271
So today Lorry, played by actress
Miss Curtis has an appointment down town.

336
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,523
She will be seeing her agent.

337
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,818
Oh, she is play in the new movie.

338
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,947
No it is her advertising agent.

339
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:33,868
The new yogurt will hit the market soon
and they wanted her to advertise it on TV.

340
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,204
You know, like a new commercial.

341
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,081
New yogurt, huh?

342
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,250
Yup and my brother is
planning to kill Lorry there.

343
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:45,129
I mean Miss Curtis along
with some members of the agency.

344
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:50,176
Maybe today is the
day he will finally kill her.

345
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,679
What if he misses?

346
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,390
Then she goes to the beach.

347
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,183
He will follow her there.

348
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,519
What if he misses her on the beach?

349
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:03,731
Then she goes to the car dealer
and he will follow her each day.

350
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,734
And I know each day is a failure,

351
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,319
but he is strong.

352
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,071
He never gives up.

353
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:12,782
Once he starts something, he finishes it.

354
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,784

00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:32,341
You killed your fiancé and you just
start rubbing your shit everywhere.

533
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:36,929
All over his body, and stuff. Oh my God.
Did they use real poop in that show?

534
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,473
I am actually.
I think I might be your neighbor.

535
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,850
Oh, yeah.

Got to play the game, but it sucks.

Yeah. Yeah. I didn't want to say anything
but it is total bullshit.

What the fuck?

552
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,354

I have a platform that raise money for
the kids' charity I started though.

So that's tight.

Yeah, that actually might… that sounds
good, and it would work out for sure.

574
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:19,698
But, you know, it is shitty that you had
to do all those productions with Dungo.

You know.

Oh, just that like,
Dungo is like extremely ugly

578
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:32,544
and it looks like a fucking like sesame
street like kitchen sink monster.

00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:33,837
Haha.

00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,089

makeup again before the dance sequence.

and I botched that first part,
but I am going to kill it in this.

592
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:06,805
I am going to focus, it is going to be really
good and I promise I won't disappoint you…

This is just as far as I can take you.

Can we get the casting director…

Kim.

604
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,692
It was Dungo.
If the design is tweaked a little bit, I…

605
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,444
Kim, it is not Don Go.

606

I just can't keep doing this.

607
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:44,241
I can't keep getting you jobs on productions
and.. and…just have you tank them.

Okay, it was Don Go.

And he's so fucked up looking,
I couldn't concentrate. It is not my fault.

else realize that this monster looks crazy.

01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:57,430
No, maybe some other time.

1238
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:01,226
I'm going to cry any second now.

1239
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,313
Okay so what now?

1240
01:23:06,773 --> 01:23:08,775
Maybe we could read another story?

1241
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:15,281
Fine. Why not? I'm paid for
the rest of the day so let's do it!
