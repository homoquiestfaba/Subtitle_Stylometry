1
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,410
( silence )
TESTING, TESTING.

2
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,600
ONE, TWO, THREE.

3
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,980
TESTOSTERONE,
TESTICULAR CANCER, "TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES."

4
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,050
Man OKAY, WE'RE SET.

5
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,790
PARTY MONSTER, TAKE ONE.

6
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,810
Man # GOOD, SO WHY DON'T YOU START AT THE
VERY BEGINNING?

7
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:23,190
A VERY GOOD PLACE TO START, IF YOU SAY SO.

8
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,350
I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO BEGIN WITH A
BANG, DON'T YOU?

9
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:31,980
LET THEM KNOW SOMETHING HORRIBLE'S GOING TO
HAPPEN AND THEN, POOF...

10
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,780
WE'RE SUDDENLY ELSEWHERE.

11
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,840
MICHAEL ALIG'S BLOOD FEAST PARTY.

12
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:50,970
JUST A QUIET NIGHT OUT WITH A FEW FRIENDS.

13
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,160
( laughs )
THAT'S MICHAEL, EXHIBIT A,

14
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,130
KING OF THE CLUB KIDS.

15
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,399
WHAT A MESS.

16
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,750
HE USED TO BE SUCH A SWEET KID.

17
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,990
MICHAEL, I HATE YOU FOR MAKING ME SAY SERIOUS
THINGS,

18
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:13,790
SO I WILL ONLY SAY THIS ONCE.

19
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,890
YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR WITH THE DRUGS.

20
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,500
HAVE YOU LOOKED IN THE MIRROR LATELY?

21
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,360
EXHIBIT B, MOI,
THE YOUNGER PRETTIER ONE.

22
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,950
I WAS GOING TO WRITE THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL.

23
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:34,680
BUT INSTEAD, I FOUND MYSELF PLAYING THE SIDEKICK
IN A SICK AND TWISTED BUDDY MOVIE.

24
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,650
JAMES,
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT THE ONE THAT'S A MESS

25
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,650
HERE?

26
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,660
( laughs )
James OKAY, GUILTY AS CHARGED.

27
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,670
BUT THINGS WERE ABOUT TO GET A WHOLE LOT MESSIER.

28
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,320
SO COME WITH ME NOW
ON THE LAST NIGHT OF MY LIFE,

29
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,030
THE NIGHT OF MY OVERDOSE.

30
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,080
YOO-HOO, ANYBODY HOME?

31
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,769
THERE YOU ARE.

32
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:09,400
- YOU LOOK AWFUL.

33
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,060
- SO DO YOU.

34
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,120
SO, HOW'S THE NOVEL COMING?

35
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,409
WELL, I'VE DONE ANOTHER PAGE.

36
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:21,480
BUT NOW I THINK I MIGHT HAVE WRITER'S BLOCK.

37
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,620
TWO PAGES IN FIVE YEARS?

38
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,280
Michael COME.

39
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:38,359
WE'LL TAKE OUR TEA IN THE BEDROOM.

40
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:45,879
SO...

41
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:53,620
NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT?

42
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,810
THE FLIES?

43
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,030
NO, SERIOUSLY, JAMES.

44
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,719
ANYTHING OR ANYONE MISSING?

45
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:03,290
LIKE A DRUG DEALER THAT USED TO LIVE HERE?

46
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,120
WELL, DARLING, THAT COULD BE ANYONE.

47
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,400
CAN I BUY A VOWEL?

48
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,450
THINK.

49
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,680
( snorting )
I KNOW, ANGEL.

50
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,789
WHERE IS ANGEL ANYWAY?

51
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:20,199
- I KILLED HIM.

52
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:23,480
- OF COURSE YOU DID, DARLING.

53
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,100
OH, HOW I HATE HEROIN.

54
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,410
NEW SHOES?

55
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:36,380
OH, THEY'RE ANGEL'S.

56
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,830
HE WAS WEARING THEM AT THE TIME.

57
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,060
OF COURSE HE WAS, DARLING.

58
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:53,669
AND THAT'S BLOOD ON THE TOE, RIGHT?

59
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:58,330
I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

60
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,820
IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.

61
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,970
JAMES?

62
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,120
JAMES?

63
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,280
JAMES?

64
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,740
OH, TYPICAL JAMES.

65
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,510
TIRED OLD DRUG ADDICT.

66
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,460
CAN'T EVEN STAY AWAKE FOR YOUR OWN MOVIE.

67
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,790
NOT THAT IT'S YOUR MOVIE.

68
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:25,270
YOU THINK IT'S YOURS,
BUT IT'S REALLY MINE.

69
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,360
ALL MINE.

70
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:36,090
( harp playing )
HI, I'M MICHAEL.

71
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,690
I GREW UP IN THE MIDWEST.

72
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:42,250
USUAL STORY, FELT DIFFERENT, REALLY DIDN'T
FIT IN.

73
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,770
BUT I WASN'T GOING TO TURN THE OTHER CHEEK.

74
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:45,850
NO SIREE.

75
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:54,200
I STARTED SELLING CANDY IN SCHOOL,
JACKED UP THE PRICES SEVERAL HUNDRED PERCENT.

76
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,320
THIS IS MY MICHAEL.

77
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,170
HE WAS ALWAYS MAKING MONEY.

78
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,570
HE JUST-- HE HAD A KNACK FOR IT.

79
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,900
MY LITTLE CANDY MAN.

80
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,630
Michael LET'S SEE, WHAT ELSE?

81
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:12,320
OH, ONCE WHEN I WAS ,
MY SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHER TOOK ME BACK TO HIS

82
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
HOUSE.

83
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,560
HE TAUGHT ME HOW TO FRENCH KISS,
AMONG OTHER THINGS.

84
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,290
HE REALLY TOOK MY BOY UNDER HIS WING.

85
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,740
VERY NICE MAN.

86
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,950
HIS MOTHER CAUGHT US IN THE BASEMENT AND SHE
SCREAMED,

87
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,700
"I TOLD YOU NOT TO BRING THEM HERE!"

88
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,890
AND HE SAID, "DON'T, YOU'LL FRIGHTEN HIM AWAY."

89
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:38,150
ONE NIGHT MICHAEL GAVE ME A GOOD NIGHT KISS
THAT A LITTLE BOY SHOULD NOT GIVE HIS MOTHER.

90
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,850
I THOUGHT EVERYONE KISSED LIKE THAT.

91
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:45,440
SO LIKE ANY SMALL TOWN BOY
I HAD BIG-TIME PLANS.

92
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,640
SO IT SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE
THAT I ENDED UP IN NEW YORK CITY.

93
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,470
ONE DAY I REALIZED I DIDN'T WANT
TO HAVE TO GET UP IN THE MORNING AND GO TO

94
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,470
WORK.

95
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,780
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE LIKE ALL THE DREARIES
AND NORMALS.

96
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:06,070
I WANTED TO CREATE MY OWN WORLD,
A WORLD FULL OF COLOR, WHERE EVERYONE COULD

97
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,710
PLAY--
ONE BIG PARTY

98
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,010
THAT NEVER ENDS.

99
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,530
NO, NO, NO!

100
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,430
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, NO.

101
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,540
WE ARE NOT GOING TO START WITH MICHAEL ALIG'S
PATHETIC CHILDHOOD--

102
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,590
"I WAS MOLESTED."

103
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:27,400
( mock crying )
I HAD A HARD TIME GROWING UP, TOO.

104
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,870
- ( toilet flushing ) - AND I DREAMT OF BIGGER
AND BETTER THINGS.

105
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,000
AND I MOVED TO NEW YORK CITY BEFORE HE DID.

106
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,460
I, I, I WAS THE ORIGINAL CLUB KID.

107
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,930
SO, NOW THAT THAT'S SORTED...

108
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:49,129
A FEW SIMPLE RULES OF NEW YORK NIGHTLIFE IN
THE EARLY 's

109
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:57,590
? NEW YORK, NEW YORK ?
? NEW YORK, NEW YORK...

110
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:03,320
?
James RULE NUMBER ONE PERCEPTION IS REALITY.

111
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,510
SO WHEN YOU'RE GOING NIGHTCLUBBING, NEVER
MERELY ARRIVE,

112
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:10,430
ALWAYS MAKE AN ENTRANCE.

113
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,860
( horn honks )
RULE NUMBER TWO

114
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,690
MAKE SURE YOUR OUTFIT WORKS IN BLACK AND WHITE
AND THAT IT'S A CONVERSATION PIECE,

115
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,090
EVEN IF YOU ARE THE ONE DOING THE TALKING.

116
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,270
IT'S BLOOD FEAST FOR JUNE BRIDES.

117
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,150
GET ME TO THE CHURCH ON TIME.

118
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,380
? YOU'LL BE FAMOUS...

119
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,460
?
OKAY, RULE NUMBER THREE

120
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:36,020
WATCH OUT FOR PUSHY, OBNOXIOUS LITTLE BUSBOYS
WHO DON'T KNOW THEIR PLACE IN THE SCHEME OF

121
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,020
THINGS.

122
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,140
HI, I'M MICHAEL ALIG.

123
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,339
WELL, I'LL ALERT THE MEDIA.

124
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:43,219
GOTTA DASH.

125
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:48,550
James OH, IF ONLY I HAD TOSSED HIM ASIDE.

126
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:53,250
BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO RESIST MINISTERING
TO LIFE'S LOSERS.

127
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,620
- YOU'RE LATE.

128
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,990
- I KNOW.

129
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,790
I REALLY SHOULDN'T HAVE COME AT ALL.

130
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,890
THAT'S MY DOUGHNUT.

131
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:04,820
WELL, I DIDN'T EXPECT TO BE DINING AT THE
FOUR SEASONS.

132
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,890
- WHAT DO YOU DO?

133
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,310
- I DON'T DO.

134
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,000
I JUST AM.

135
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,170
EXTREMELY RICH.

136
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:14,340
ANYWAY, IF I'M TO STAY IN THIS ROACH MOTEL
A MOMENT LONGER

137
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,830
WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO TAKE THINGS UP A NOTCH.

138
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,770
- I DON'T DO DRUGS.

139
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:22,690
- NOR DO I.
DID YOU SEE THAT?

140
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,420
IT JUST FLEW RIGHT UP MY NOSE!

141
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,679
- MY MOTHER SAYS DRUGS ARE FOR LOSERS.

142
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:28,930
- SHE'S SO RIGHT.

143
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,970
KETAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE, A.K.A.

144
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:35,600
SPECIAL K,
IS MAINLY USED BY VETS AS AN ANIMAL TRANQUILIZER.

145
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,009
WHEN TAKEN BY HUMANS IT WORKS AS A DISSOCIATIVE
DRUG

146
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:43,040
SELECTIVELY REDUCING EXCITATION OF THE CENTRAL
MAMMALIAN NEURONS

147
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,420
BY N METHYL ASPIRATE.

148
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:49,470
IN OTHER WORDS, IT FUCKS YOU UP!

149
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,759
I WANT YOU TO TEACH ME HOW TO BE FABULOUS.

150
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:56,149
( scoffs )
WE HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON.

151
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:57,149
WAIT!

152
00:09:57,149 --> 00:09:59,920
WE BOTH BITE OUR NAILS.

153
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,950
PLEASE, DON'T GO.

154
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,089
I DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS.

155
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:04,089
I JUST GOT HERE.

156
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:05,790
I JUST GOT OFF THE BUS.

157
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:10,350
"THE ROAD OF EXCESS LEADS TO THE PALACE OF
WISDOM."

158
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,100
BLAKE, WILLIAM.

159
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,990
THAT'S REALLY ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW.

160
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,830
THAT AND "DON'T DREAM IT, BE IT."

161
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,589
"ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW."

162
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:18,589
IT'S MY FAVORITE.

163
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,759
AND WILL YOU SIGN MY COPY OF "SLATED"?

164
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:23,890
YOU LOOK SO GOOD IN IT.

165
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,760
FLATTERY WILL GET YOU EVERYWHERE.

166
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,709
James IT'S ALL ABOUT PHOTO PLACEMENT.

167
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:33,249
SO IF YOU'RE IN A GROUP OF THREE, ALWAYS,
ALWAYS,

168
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:36,230
ALWAYS MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE THE ONE STANDING
ON THE RIGHT.

169
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,570
THAT WAY WHEN THEY PRINT THE PICTURE, YOU'LL
BE THE ONE ON THE LEFT

170
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,850
AND THE CAPTION WILL READ "JAMES ST.

171
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:45,029
JAMES
AND BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, WERE SEEN, OKAY?

172
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:50,600
OKAY, RULES OF PRESS
NUMBER ONE NO PUBLICITY IS BAD PUBLICITY.

173
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,879
NUMBER TWO ONCE SOMETHING IS PRINTED, IT AUTOMATICALLY
BECOMES TRUE,

174
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:57,579
SO NUMBER THREE NEVER, EVER DISH ANYONE IN
PRINT.

175
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:00,410
NEVER BE SEEN DRINKING ANYTHING OTHER THAN
CHAMPAGNE

176
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,589
AND NEVER TAKE HEROIN.

177
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:08,199
NEVER WEAR WHITE AFTER LABOR DAY AND OH,
AVOID THAT ONE LIKE THE PLAGUE.

178
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:09,199
MORE!

179
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:10,199
MORE!

180
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:11,199
OKAY.

181
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:12,199
OKAY.

182
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:18,089
THE ART OF WORKING A ROOM
UPON MAKING YOUR GRAND ENTRANCE,

183
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:21,870
TAKE YOUR PARTNER BY THE HAND AND CIRCLE AROUND
THE ROOM,

184
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:25,439
SMILE AND SAY HELLO TO EVERYONE IN THE ROOM,
EVEN IF YOU DON'T KNOW THEM.

185
00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:27,149
ESPECIALLY IF YOU DON'T KNOW THEM.

186
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:28,149
- HI!

187
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:29,149
HI!

188
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:30,149
- HI!

189
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:31,149
HI!

190
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,149
I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME.

191
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,149
- I KNOW YOU.

192
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:34,149
- HE'S FABULOUS.

193
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:35,149
GO ONCE AROUND THE ROOM IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.

194
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:37,209
GO CLOCKWISE TO MY ANTI-CLOCKWISE.

195
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:41,709
TELL ALL THE PEOPLE HOW YOU'VE LOST YOUR FRIEND
AND HOW DESPERATE YOU ARE TO FIND THEM.

196
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:43,459
WHERE CAN MY FRIEND BE?

197
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:47,649
NOW, SUDDENLY WE BUMP INTO EACH OTHER
AND SCREAM WITH UNCONTAINED JOY.

198
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:51,839
( both screaming )
GOOD, NOW LINK ARMS AND ROUND WE GO ONCE MORE

199
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,139
TELLING ALL OUR NEWFOUND FRIENDS HOW WE'VE
FOUND EACH OTHER.

200
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:56,639
- WE FOUND EACH OTHER.

201
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,509
- DON'T WORRY, I FOUND HIM.

202
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,509
THEN LEAVE.

203
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:00,999
THE WHOLE THING SHOULD TAKE AN HOUR.

204
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:01,999
MINUTES TOPS.

205
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:05,199
DO THAT ONCE A NIGHT FOR THREE MONTHS AND
YOU'LL BE THE TOAST OF THE TOWN.

206
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:06,980
HEAVENS, IS THAT THE TIME?

207
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,980
MY SANSKRIT CLASS.

208
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,980
WAIT, WAIT!

209
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,860
I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY
AND AREN'T YOU GOING TO TEACH ME HOW TO THROW

210
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,860
A PARTY?

211
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,629
HOW ABOUT LEARNING TO CRAWL BEFORE YOU WALK?

212
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:15,629
TOODLES!

213
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:18,559
James BUT MICHAEL WASN'T INTERESTED IN LEARNING
TO CRAWL OR WALK.

214
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,339
JUST RUN, RUN, RUN.

215
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:26,410
( techno music playing )
I WENT TO HIS FIRST PARTY.

216
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,980
UNFORTUNATELY.

217
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,980
THERE IS NO ONE HERE.

218
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,980
CHRISTINA'S HERE.

219
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,379
? FIRST I'M GOING TO WHIP YOU ?
? THEN I'M GOING TO EAT YOU...

220
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:34,009
?
SHE'S FABULOUS.

221
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:45,959
ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT WAS HOW I WAS GOING
TO BE RUINED

222
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:52,170
LOOK, JAMES, THIS IS GOING TO BE MORE THAN
A CLUB.

223
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:56,129
IT'LL BE-- IT'LL BE LIKE OUR HOME.

224
00:12:56,129 --> 00:12:58,209
FOR EVERYONE WHO FELT LIKE A FREAK,
EVERYONE WHO'S EVER BEAT ON OR SPAT ON IN

225
00:12:58,209 --> 00:12:59,800
HIGH SCHOOL,
FOR EVERYONE WHO FELT DIFFERENT.

226
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,810
IT'LL BE LIKE THE FACTORY AND I'LL BE THE
NEXT ANDY WARHOL.

227
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,220
EARTH TO YOU, ANDY WARHOL IS STILL ALIVE AND
WELL.

228
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,889
IN FACT, I JUST REMEMBERED I'M SUPPOSED TO
MEET HIM.

229
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,110
WAIT, DON'T GO!

230
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,160
DO YOU WANT A COCKTAIL?

231
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,160
HERE.

232
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,879
- I HAVE DRINK TICKETS.

233
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,329
- DRINK TICKETS?

234
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,839
( laughs )
YOU OBVIOUSLY COULDN'T EVEN ORGANIZE A GLASS

235
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:25,539
OF WATER.

236
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:31,239
- OH YEAH?

237
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:34,100
- YEAH.

238
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:39,800
( gasping )
( laughing )

239
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:51,209
James YOU CRAZY FUCK!

240
00:13:51,209 --> 00:13:57,390
THAT WAS QUITE A STUNT...

241
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:00,319
FLOODING MY BASEMENT.

242
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:04,240
( giggling )
I'M SORRY.

243
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,529
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU INTEND TO DO
ABOUT IT?

244
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:11,080
YOU NEED ME TO PROMOTE THIS PLACE.

245
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,879
I COULD MAKE IT FABULOUS.

246
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:16,559
NOT IF TONIGHT'S ANYTHING TO GO BY.

247
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,770
IT'S NOT ME THAT'S TIRED, IT'S YOUR CLUB.

248
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:24,889
NO ONE WANTS TO COME HERE.

249
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:32,990
Man IT'S A STATEMENT.

250
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,850
THE DAMAGE DONE TO THE CLUB WILL BE REIMBURSED
FROM YOUR EARNINGS FROM THIS PARTY AND THE

251
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,589
NEXT TWO PARTIES
THAT YOU THROW.

252
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:41,589
WOW!

253
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,369
A JOB.

254
00:14:43,369 --> 00:14:47,079
- YOU WON'T REGRET THIS.

255
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:48,079
- WE'LL SEE.

256
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,899
I LOVE THE EYE-PATCH, BY THE WAY.

257
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:54,100
IT'S VERY "PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN."

258
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,100
ARR!

259
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,940
HE LOST IT.

260
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,940
WHATEVER.

261
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,899
YOU SHOULD COME TO MY HOUSE.

262
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:03,879
I'LL COOK FOR YOU.

263
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:05,759
YOU'LL LOVE MY MEATLOAF.

264
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:08,029
YOUR ASSISTANT CAN COME, TOO.

265
00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:09,570
OH, I'M SORRY.

266
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,509
MY HUSBAND IS A VERY BUSY MAN.

267
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:17,410
BESIDES, WE DON'T SOCIALIZE WITH THE EMPLOYEES.

268
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:20,350
YOU'LL LOVE ME.

269
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:28,180
I PROMISE.

270
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:53,569
Michael HEY, CHRISTINA,
I'VE DECIDED TO MAKE YOU MY FIRST SUPERSTAR.

271
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:56,670
( giggling )
COME TO MY PARTY.

272
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,149

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,670
COME TO MY PARTY.

277
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:13,389
OH, DUDE, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

278
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,529
YOU CAN BE MY BOYFRIEND.

279
00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:21,579
OH, ACTUALLY, I'M-- I'M NOT GAY.

280
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:24,589
I'M ACTUALLY HERE WITH A COUPLE OF BABES,

281
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:27,579
LET'S TALK AFTER A COUPLE OF COCKTAILS.

283
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,540

287
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,580

288
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,580

( sniffs )

289
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,580
OH JAMES,
I'M SO GLAD I RAN INTO YOU.

00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,580
HERE, COME TO MY PARTY.

291
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,089
THE FIRST ANNUAL KING AND QUEEN OF DOWNTOWN
PAGEANT.

292
00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:03,110
I'D RATHER SUCK ON A URINAL CAKE.

293
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,010
BUT JAMES, YOU HAVE TO COME.

294
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,400
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

295
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,880
HOW CAN I BE YOUR BEST FRIEND
WHEN I DON'T EVEN LIKE YOU?

296
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,880
HAVE YOU MET KEOKI?

297
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,880
WELL, ALOHA.

298
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,669
HOW ABOUT A LEI?

299
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:21,660
( laughing )
I'VE ALWAYS HAD A SOFT SPOT FOR HAWAIIAN PUNCH.

300
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,340
HIS NAME IS KEOKI AND HE'S MY NEW BOYFRIEND.

301
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,770

302
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,190

TOODLES?

315
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,890
YOU KNOW,
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE RIDING A CAB

316
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:04,890
THROUGH THE BRONX WITH A GUY.

317
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:11,070
YOU KNOW, I FIGURE COME TO THE CLUB
AND TELL A COUPLE OF GIRLS NO, NOT TONIGHT.

318
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,070
BUT I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE--

319
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,070

323
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,940
- ALL THE WAY, I HOPE.

324
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:35,929
Keoki NO, I MEAN I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

325
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:36,929
Michael DON'T WORRY.

326
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:37,929
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

327
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:38,929
Michael GET OUT!

328
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:39,929

- ( both laughing ) - ( cat meowing )
Keoki WHAT WAS THAT?

340
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:49,049
IT'S A KITTY.

341
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:50,840
IT'S OUR LOVE CHILD.

342
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,820
WE'LL CALL HIM SKRINKLE.

343
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:59,990
James AS YOU DRY YOUR EYES,
LET ME JUST SAY THIS ABOUT THAT.

344
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,440
SKRINKLE WAS JUST THE BEGINNING.

345
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,059
SKRINKLE BEGAT SKRODDLE, AND SKRINKLE AND
SKRODDLE

346
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:09,440
WERE THE LEGO BLOCKS OF A STRANGE NEW WORLD
HE WAS BUILDING FOR US ALL.

347
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,000
YOU WERE EITHER A SKRINK OR A SKROD.

348
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,460
I WAS A SKRINK-LA DA IF I WAS GOOD.

349
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,840
OR A STUPID SKROD LOVER IF I WAS BAD.

350
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,480
SOMEHOW HIS DOPEY LANGUAGE CAUGHT ON.

351
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,520
LIKE HIS STUPID PARTIES.

352
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,230
( drum roll )
THE WINNERS OF MICHAEL ALIG'S

353
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,320
FIRST KING AND QUEEN OF DOWNTOWN CONTEST...

354
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,429
CHRISTINA SUPERSTAR
AND KEOKI THE IT BOY.

355
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:33,429
CONGRATULATIONS.

356
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:35,110
? THEY ONLY WANT YOU WHEN YOU'RE ?
? WHEN YOU'RE YOU'RE NO FUN ?

357
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:50,630
? THEY TAKE A POLAROID AND LET YOU GO...

358
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:58,789
?
James HE WAS TROUBLE ALL RIGHT.

359
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:06,279
MICHAEL WAS OUT FOR REVENGE.

360
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:14,769
THAT'S WHAT I LIKED ABOUT HIM.

361
00:21:14,769 --> 00:21:17,159
( whimpering )
( laughing )

362
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:20,480
MICHAEL WAS GROWING ON ME,
LIKE A FUNGUS.

363
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,600
HOW ELSE TO EXPLAIN HOW HE GOT ME TO HAUL
MY ASS

364
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:30,280
ABOVE th STREET TO HIS SIXTH FLOOR WALK-UP
IN THE BRONX ONE CHRISTMAS EVE?

365
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,280
THE NORTH POLE.

366
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,250
I'VE MADE IT ACROSS THE FROZEN TUNDRA.

367
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,470
MY FAITHFUL HUSKIES PERISHED IN THE BLIZZARD
WAY BACK.

368
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,160
I HAD TO EAT THEM.

369
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,740
( James laughing )
KEOKI, WOULD YOU BE A LAMB AND RUB MY EXTREMITIES?

370
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,860
I FEAR THEY'RE FROSTBITTEN.

371
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:55,889
JAMES, I WANT YOU TO BE ON YOUR BEST BEHAVIOR
BECAUSE TONIGHT I'VE INVITED

372
00:21:55,889 --> 00:21:58,520
A VERY IMPORTANT SURPRISE GUEST.

373
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,140
LET ME GUESS, CHRISTINA.

374
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,270
AND SHE'S GOING TO CHOP US ALL UP AND SERVE
US AS FONDUE.

375
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:07,970
I KNOW WHAT PIECE I WANT.

376
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:12,940
KEOKI, COULD YOU CARVE THE TURKEY?

377
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,160
YOU KNOW I CAN'T BEAR TO.

378
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,049
DARLING, HALF THE FUN OF EATING MEAT IS HACKING
IT UP.

379
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:25,240
- ( door buzzing ) - JAMES, CAN YOU GET THAT?

380
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:30,899
Radio ? Think of all the fun I've missed...

381
00:22:30,899 --> 00:22:31,899
?
HELLO.

382
00:22:31,899 --> 00:22:35,759
YEAH, RIGHT THERE IS FINE.

383
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:50,440
? Next year I could be just as good ?
? If you'd check off my Christmas list...

384
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,440
?
MICHAEL.

385
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,440
? SANTA BABY...

386
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,440
?
HA!

387
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,440
MERRY CHRISTMAS, KID.

388
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,440
OH, PETER, THANK YOU.

389
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,779
THANK YOU, PETER.

390
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:04,440
( giggles )
IT'S SO...

391
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,929
BIG.

392
00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:18,110
( clock ticking )
KEOKI, WILL YOU PUT SOME MUSIC ON?

393
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,670
YES.

394
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:32,120
JAMES, THERE'S CHAMPAGNE ON ICE IN THE FRIDGE.

395
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,040
IT'S SUCH A SHAME YOUR WIFE COULDN'T COME.

396
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,960
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN THINKING,
I'VE DECIDED IT'S TIME FOR ME TO START THROWING

397
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,550
MY OWN WEEKLY PARTY AT LIMELIGHT ON THE MAIN
DANCE FLOOR.

398
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,429
YOUR PARTIES BARELY BREAK EVEN.

399
00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:46,520
I HAVE TO LET ALL THESE PEOPLE IN FOR FREE.

400
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,309
I HAVE TO GIVE THEM FREE DRINKS.

401
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:51,820
MICHAEL, I DON'T MAKE ANY MONEY OFF OF YOU.

402
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:56,010
PETER, WILL YOU STOP BEING SUCH A NEGATIVE
NANCY?

403
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,020
PEOPLE WON'T BE SEEN DEAD IN YOUR CLUB.

404
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:02,100
I'M JUST STARTING TO GET A BUZZ GOING.

405
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:17,059
( Michael continues talking )
"O, WOULD THAT I WERE A GLOVE UPON THAT HAND..."

406
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:18,720
- HUH?

407
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,240
- "O, SPEAK AGAIN BRIGHT ANGEL."

408
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,809
YO, MAN, I'M WITH MICHAEL.

409
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:35,760
MY ONLY LOVE SPRUNG FROM MY ONLY HATE.

410
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:44,039
MAN, I CAN'T FIND A RECORD TO PLAY
AND I KNOW IT'S A SPECIAL NIGHT FOR MICHAEL.

411
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:45,690
YOU'RE RIGHT.

412
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,100
IT IS.

413
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:51,889
... GIANT ANIMAL COSTUMES LIKE ICY THE POLAR
BEAR

414
00:24:51,889 --> 00:24:53,890
AND CLARA THE CAREFREE CHICKEN.

415
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:57,639
AND TO MAKE THINGS REALLY SIZZLE, WE'LL HAVE
A HOT BODY CONTEST.

416
00:24:57,639 --> 00:25:01,560
KEOKI WILL BE THE DJ, OF COURSE.

417
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:07,210
IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE A SUPERSTAR DJ
THERE ARE THREE SIMPLE RULES YOU NEED TO REMEMBER.

418
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:11,880
NUMBER ONE
YOU CAN ALWAYS RELY ON THE STUDIO COMPILATION

419
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,880
SET.

420
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,149
THEY'RE PRE-MIXED, THEY LAST FOR HOURS.

421
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:20,480
AND NUMBER TWO
MADONNA ALWAYS WORKS.

422
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,940
AND NUMBER THREE
WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS,

423
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,840
PLAY TECHNO.

424
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:33,549
IT'S NON-DESCRIPT, NON-RECOGNIZABLE
AND EVERYONE WILL THINK THAT YOU ARE SO CUTTING

425
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:34,580
EDGE.

426
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,210
OH, I LOVE THIS RECORD.

427
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,610
IT'S SO...

428
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:49,440
DISCO .
( snorting )

429
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,080
YOU PATHETIC, DRUG-ADDICT LOSERS!

430
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,500
MICHAEL, I AM NOT ADDICTED TO DRUGS, I'M ADDICTED
TO GLAMOUR.

431
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,269
Michael YOU, JAMES CLERK,
YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF.

432
00:25:59,269 --> 00:26:02,490
HOW DARE YOU USE MY REAL NAME.

433
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:07,530
AND MICHAEL, YOUR CHAMPAGNE--
CORRECTION, YOUR SPARKLING WINE, TASTES LIKE

434
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:10,889
PISS.

435
00:26:10,889 --> 00:26:15,440
( laughs )
SO WHERE WAS I?

436
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,120
OH YEAH.

437
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,980
SO WE'LL PUT JAMES IN A CAGE
AND HANG A SIGN OVER IT THAT SAYS

438
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,130
"DO NOT FEED THE DRUG CHILD."

439
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,870
IT'LL TRANSFORM LIMELIGHT AND NEW YORK NIGHTLIFE
FOREVER.

440
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,900
IT'LL BE MORE OUTRAGEOUS THAN ANYTHING BEFORE
IT.

441
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,399
NEW STARS, NO RULES, ANYTHING GOES.

442
00:26:32,399 --> 00:26:35,380
EVERYONE WILL WANT TO COME.

443
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:40,280
MICHAEL, AREN'T YOU LISTENING TO ANYTHING
I'M SAYING?

444
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:49,669
YES SIREE, BUT THIS WILL WORK.

445
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:54,360
( unzips pants )
( urinating )

446
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,779
( sighs )
I'D STAKE MY LIFE ON IT.

447
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:00,360
- Peter YOU'RE CRAZY.

448
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:05,519
- ( disco music plays )
AH, JAMES, KEOKI.

449
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:08,539
JUST IN TIME TO TOAST TO...

450
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:14,149
DISCO .
Peter TO DISCO .

451
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:15,149
? CALLERS AS THOUGH THEY WERE CHRISTMAS EVE
?

452
00:27:15,149 --> 00:27:16,149
? DISAPPOINTED BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY ?
? SHE GAVE ME LAUGHTER AND HOPE ?

453
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:17,149
? AND A SOCK IN THE EYE ?
? IN MY YOUNG LIFE AND I KNOW SOMETHING NOW

454
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:23,470
?
? I'VE NEVER TRIED TO CREATE A WOW ?

455
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:41,370
? WOWS ARE FEW, FRUSTRATION MORE COMMON...
?

456
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:51,320
( laughing )
James MY SOUR GRAPES WERE HIS SWEET WINE.

457
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,980
DON'T ASK ME HOW, BUT IT CLICKED.

458
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:01,270
( dance music playing )
SUDDENLY THE HATEFUL LITTLE TURD

459
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:04,169
WAS THE KING OF THE CLUB KIDS.

460
00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:07,009
I HAD TO ADAPT OR DIE.

461
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:14,340
BEHIND ME, THE CHOICE OF THE NEW GENERATION--
WEIRD CLOTHES, WILD MAKE-UP

462
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:17,389
AND NO PARTICULAR SEXUAL PREFERENCE.

463
00:28:17,389 --> 00:28:20,450
CLUB KIDS OR CLUB BRATS?

464
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:32,440
YOU DECIDE.

465
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:39,340
THEY HOLD ILLEGAL OUTLAW PARTIES IN SUBWAYS
AND THEY TAKE ECSTASY,

466
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,919
A DRUG KNOWN TO CAUSE BRAIN DAMAGE IN RATS.

467
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:47,960
THE ROAD OF EXCESS LEADS TO A PALACE OF...

468
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,960
FABULOUSNESS.

469
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,580
I'M ELKE, MICHAEL'S MOM,
AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU

470
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:58,929
THAT ANYONE CAN BE A CLUB KID.

471
00:28:58,929 --> 00:29:01,210
- IT'S ECSTASY.

472
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:05,769
- ( crowd cheers )
( changes channel )

473
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:07,870
- I WAS WATCHING THAT.

474
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,390
- FAGGOT.

475
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:27,649
? TELL ME, TELL ME ?
? TELL ME, TELL ME, TELL ME, TELL ME ?

476
00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:39,830
? TELL ME, TELL ME, TELL ME, TELL ME...

477
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:42,880
?
- ALL ABOARD.

478
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:50,710
- ( cheering )
HOW DO YOU LIKE MY U.F.O.?

479
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:55,080
( laughing )
OH, DEAR GOD, NO.

480
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,080
MICHAEL!

481
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:04,840
( engine revving )
MICHAEL, I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU.

482
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:15,540
NOT NOW, WE HAVE TO GO BEFORE THE POLICE GET
HERE.

483
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,540
- GET IN.

484
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,540
- BUT, MICHAEL!

485
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,540
Michael I'M FINE.

486
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,540
HELLO.

487
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,540
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

488
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,540
- I'M ANGEL.

489
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,540
- WELL, WHERE'S YOUR WINGS?

490
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,540
- MICHAEL!

491
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,540
- HUH?

492
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,540
CAN YOU HELP US GET THIS DOOR CLOSED?

493
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:37,350
YOU HAVE TO DO IT FROM THE OUTSIDE.

494
00:30:37,350 --> 00:31:09,019
BUT IF I DO THAT I WON'T BE ABLE TO COME.

495
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:10,019
IF YOU DO THIS NOW, YOU'LL BE ONE OF US.

496
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:11,019
NEXT TIME I'LL MAKE YOU V.I.P.--
VERY VERY IMPORTANT PERSON.

497
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:12,019
- MICHAEL!

498
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:13,019
- COME ON NOW.

499
00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:14,019
BE AN ANGEL.

500
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:15,019
- MICHAEL, YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND.

501
00:31:15,019 --> 00:31:16,019
- OH PLEASE.

502
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:17,019
- PARTY IN THE TRUCK.

503
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:18,019
- ( cheering )
( sirens wailing )

504
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:19,019
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

505
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:20,019
( Christina giggling )
LET'S GO, SWEETIE.

506
00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:21,019
YOU'RE A BIG GIRL.

507
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:22,019
GET UP.

508
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:26,150
ALL RIGHT.

509
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:35,350
( dance music playing )
James MICHAEL, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU BOUGHT

510
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,350
ALL THIS CRAP.

511
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,320
Michael OH, JAMES, DON'T BE JEALOUS.

512
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,750
I'VE GOT A LUXURY CONDO AND YOU DON'T.

513
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,750
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE, IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

514
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,750
TIME TO PAY ATTENTION TO ME.

515
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:42,750
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

516
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,750
- THANK YOU.

517
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,750
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BABY.

518
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,510
- OH, KEOKI, HOW NICE OF YOU TO SHOW UP
AFTER WHAT, FOUR OR FIVE DAYS?

519
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:52,110
YOU'RE FUCKED UP, AREN'T YOU?

520
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:55,790
EVERYONE, THIS IS FREEZ.

521
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:59,820
HE USED TO BE A HAT-MAKER,
NOW HE'S A DRUG DEALER.

522
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,570
EVERYONE SAY HELLO.

523
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,410
MICHAEL, PLEASE.

524
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:05,410
HA!

525
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,720
FUCKING JUNKIE.

526
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,299
OH, IS THAT FOR ME?

527
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:13,140
HOW LOVELY.

528
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,160
TAKE IT, YOU LITTLE FUCK!

529
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,590
( record scratches, music stops )
HEY, DON'T TOUCH MY RECORDS, MAN.

530
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,720
YOUR RECORDS?

531
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,720
DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH.

532
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,720
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO PLAY.

533
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:40,279
YOU'RE NOT A SUPERSTAR DJ,
YOU'RE A PIECE OF SHIT DJ AND EVERYBODY KNOWS

534
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:42,690
IT.

535
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:48,950
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS ON GETTING OUT
OF THE VERY DANGEROUS WORLD OF HABERDASHERY.

536
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:54,770
OH, DRUGS ARE JUST A SIDELINE.

537
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:59,370
PROFITABLE, THOUGH.

538
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:10,870
MAY I SAMPLE YOUR WARES?

539
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:22,370
( thunder cracks )
( music box playing )

540
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:29,610
MICHAEL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

541
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:30,830
SKRINKLE AND I JUST DID ALL YOUR COCAINE.

542
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,830
YOU DID WHAT?

543
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:32,870
I FIGURED IF YOU WERE GOING TO RUIN OUR RELATIONSHIP
BY DOING DRUGS

544
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,159
I SHOULD SEE WHAT ALL THE FUSS IS ABOUT.

545
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:36,980
GREAT, SO NOW WE HAVE TWO DRUG ADDICTS IN
THE FAMILY?

546
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:40,130
AND SKRINKLE MAKES THREE.

547
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:42,999
DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE?

548
00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:44,580
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "ANY MORE"?

549
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,580
MORE AS IN MORE, MORON.

550
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,990
WHAT PART DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND, DUH-FACE?

551
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:50,990
FUCK YOU.

552
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,009
I'M OUT OF HERE.

553
00:33:53,009 --> 00:33:56,419
YOU'RE JUST MAD 'CAUSE I DID ALL YOUR STUFF
AND I DIDN'T EVEN LIKE IT.

554
00:33:56,419 --> 00:34:09,960
IF YOU WALK OUT THAT DOOR I'M GOING TO KILL
MYSELF.

555
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:15,869
( door slams )
? TURN AROUND ?

556
00:34:15,869 --> 00:34:19,440
? EVERY NOW AND THEN I GET A LITTLE BIT LONELY
?

557
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,100
? AND YOU'RE NEVER COMING ROUND ?
? TURN AROUND ?

558
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,460
? EVERY NOW AND THEN I GET A LITTLE...

559
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,460
?
WAKE UP, MICHAEL.

560
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,460
YOU CAME.

561
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:33,380
? EVERY NOW AND THEN I GET A LITTLE...

562
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:36,120
?
THESE SUICIDE ATTEMPTS HAVE GOT TO STOP.

563
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,810
WE ALL KNOW THAT YOU'RE FAR TOO SELFISH
TO EVER HURT YOURSELF.

564
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:42,450
JAMES, HOLD ME, PLEASE.

565
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:45,099
I FEEL COLD INSIDE.

566
00:34:45,099 --> 00:34:52,369
? EVERY NOW AND THEN I FALL APART ?
? TURN AROUND, BRIGHT EYES...

567
00:34:52,369 --> 00:35:04,010
?
OKAY, JUST THIS ONCE.

568
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:06,869
I JUST WANT TO BE LOVED.

569
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:10,540
THERE ISN'T ENOUGH LOVE
IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD TO SATISFY YOU.

570
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,660
WELL, KEOKI'S ALL I NEED.

571
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:27,460
I KNOW WHAT YOU NEED--
A NICE HOT CUP OF HOT CHOCOLATE.

572
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:35,500
CAN YOU PUT SOME ECSTASY IN MINE?

573
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,500
WHAT?

574
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,670
SINCE WHEN ARE YOU INTO DRUGS?

575
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,210
ECSTASY ISN'T A DRUG, SILLY.

576
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:43,800
IT'S NOT EVEN A LISTED SUBSTANCE.

577
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:57,210
IT'S JUST MEDICATION
FOR MY RAPID-CYCLING BIPOLAR DISORDER.

578
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,880
PEOPLE SAY WE'RE SUPERFICIAL.

579
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,849
WE ARE.

580
00:36:00,849 --> 00:36:02,290
PROFOUNDLY SO.

581
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:08,150
WE'RE TWO PEAS IN A POD, YOU AND I, JAMES.

582
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,630
PITY THE POD.

583
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:13,600
YOU'RE THE YODA TO MY LUKE.

584
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,349
EXCUSE ME.

585
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:17,910
YOU ARE THE PAULA ABDUL TO MY JANET JACKSON.

586
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:20,160
THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?

587
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:26,490
DID I EVER TELL YOU ABOUT MY FIRST BOYFRIEND
IN JUNIOR HIGH?

588
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:29,829
I THINK YOU'RE ABOUT TO.

589
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:30,829
CUE THE MUSIC.

590
00:36:30,829 --> 00:36:33,600
( soft piano plays )
WHEN I WAS WE WERE INSEPARABLE, HIM AND I.

591
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:38,750
SO THAT WE WOULD NEVER HAVE TO BE APART
WE CAME UP WITH THIS PLAN THAT HE'D KIDNAP

592
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:41,890
ME
AND MY BODY WOULD NEVER EVER BE FOUND.

593
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:46,700
WE SPENT DAYS PRACTICING
TO SEE HOW LONG I COULD SPEND IN CONFINED

594
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,700
SPACES.

595
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,109
ON THE DAY BEFORE THE KIDNAPPING
HIS FATHER FOUND US WRESTLING.

596
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:58,240
AFTER THAT, HE NEVER TALKED TO ME AGAIN.

597
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:04,599
I CALLED HIM LAST NIGHT,
AFTER KEOKI LEFT.

598
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:09,960
HE'S MARRIED NOW, WITH KIDS.

599
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,530
HE WOULDN'T EVEN COME TO THE PHONE.

600
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:17,670
HIS WIFE HUNG UP ON ME.

601
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:24,470
I REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD MOVE IN WITH ME,
JAMES.

602
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:32,500
I'M JUST LIKE A BALLOON,
UNLESS SOMEONE HOLDS MY STRING...

603
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:50,410
I'LL FLOAT AWAY.

604
00:37:50,410 --> 00:38:08,910
GOOD, IT'S SETTLED THEN.

605
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:13,749
WE'LL GO GET YOUR STUFF LATER TODAY.

606
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:19,480
( cuckoo chiming )
( Michael whistling )

607
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,089
Michael OUR MAGAZINE'S ON THE STANDS TODAY.

608
00:38:23,089 --> 00:38:24,089
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

609
00:38:24,089 --> 00:38:25,660
OUR OWN MAGAZINE.

610
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,820
I'VE ALREADY SEEN IT.

611
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:30,490
AND THERE'S A PROBLEM, A BIG PROBLEM.

612
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:32,710
I'VE BEEN CUT OFF.

613
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:36,050
"JAMES ST.

614
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,510
JAMES HEADS UP WHITE SLAVE RING.

615
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:41,400
SELLS -YEAR-OLD BOYS ON AVENUE B.
EXCLUSIVE BY MICHAEL ALIG."

616
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,589
WHY, MICHAEL, WHY?

617
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:46,059
COME ON, SKRINK, I THINK IT'S FUNNY.

618
00:38:46,059 --> 00:38:50,380
( scoffs )
MY FATHER DOES NOT SHARE YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR.

619
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:52,690
I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS A "PROJECT X" READER.

620
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:56,080
YES YOU DID, BECAUSE YOU SENT HIM A LIFETIME
SUBSCRIPTION.

621
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,569
AND NOW I'VE BEEN CUT OFF WITHOUT A PENNY.

622
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:07,520
SO NO MORE TRUST FUND AND NO MORE GAULTIER
AND NO MORE FUCKING COMMES DES GARCONS, MICHAEL.

623
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,920
WELL, AT LEAST YOU HAVE A FATHER.

624
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:16,589
MICHAEL, FOR ONCE,
THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU.

625
00:39:16,589 --> 00:39:21,980
LOOK, JAMES, I'M SORRY.

626
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:24,000
I'LL TALK TO YOUR FATHER.

627
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,230
I PROMISE.

628
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,070
LOOK...

629
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:34,730
WHY DON'T WE MAKE A PACT, OKAY?

630
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:41,770
THAT WHENEVER YOU'RE DOWN, I'LL HELP YOU,
AND WHENEVER I'M DOWN, YOU'LL HELP ME.

631
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:43,809
IT'S KIND OF LIKE A SEESAW.

632
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:45,840
EXCEPT NEITHER ONE OF US CAN GET OFF.

633
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,220
( laughs )
? I-I-I-I-I need ?

634
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:55,470
? I need you ?
? I-I-I-I-I-I Need...

635
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:58,600
?
COME ON.

636
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,720
COME ON.

637
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:18,160
? I-I-I need, I need you ?
? Two of hearts ?

638
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:42,340
? Two hearts that beat as one ?
- ? Two of hearts ? - ? I need you, I need

639
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,340
you ?
? Two of hearts ?

640
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,340
? Two hearts that beat as one ?
? Two of hearts, come on, come on ?

641
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,340
? I-I-I-I-I need ?
? I need you ?

642
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,340
? I-I-I-I-I need ?
? I-I-I-I-I need ?

643
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,340
? I need, I need ?
? I need you.

644
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,340
?
WHAT'S FOR DINNER, JAMES?

645
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,340
I'M STARVED.

646
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,340
I FINISHED THE MOST MARVELOUS SENTENCE TODAY.

647
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,340
THAT'S GREAT.

648
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,340
WHAT'S FOR DINNER?

649
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,340
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR TWO WHOLE WEEKS.

650
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,900
THE RHYTHM, THE SYNTAX, THE DISSONANCE,
THE DIPHTHONGS-- IT'S PERFECT.

651
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:03,589
( clears throat )
"LAST NIGHT I DREAMT OF GLOCCA MORRA...

652
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:07,040
AGAIN."

653
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,720
IT'S REALLY A SHAME YOU CAN'T PUBLISH A SENTENCE.

654
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:21,349
I'M CONVINCED IT WOULD BE A BESTSELLER.

655
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:24,959
( bell ringing )
( James humming )

656
00:41:24,959 --> 00:41:29,089
( sizzling )
LIGHTLY TOASTED ANIMAL TRANQUILIZER

657
00:41:29,089 --> 00:41:36,079
EXPERTLY PREPARED BY YOUR SOUS CHEF.

658
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:42,869
- DID KEOKI CALL?

659
00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:43,869
- NO.

660
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:45,250
HE PROMISED HE'D CALL.

661
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:55,010
WE'LL SEE HIM NEXT WEEK IN DALLAS, IF HE BOTHERS
TO SHOW UP.

662
00:41:55,010 --> 00:42:02,970
( laughs )
YOU KNOW WHAT?

663
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:06,750
YOU NEED A NEW PROJECT,
SOMETHING TO KEEP YOU BUSY.

664
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:09,930
I KNOW,
WHY NOT CREATE A NEW SUPERSTAR?

665
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:12,840
A SUPERSTAR DRUG DEALER.

666
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:16,369
THEY'D BE INSTANTLY POPULAR BECAUSE DRUG DEALERS
CAN AFFORD THE BEST OUTFITS AND EVERYBODY

667
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:17,470
LOVES DRUGS.

668
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:20,280
THEY WOULD GIVE YOU ALL THE DRUGS YOU WANTED
FOR FREE.

669
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:25,020
AND IF THEY DIDN'T, I'D JUST THEM RIGHT OUT
OF THE CLUB.

670
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,020
- DON'T SPILL IT.

671
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:29,410
- MICHAEL, YOU'RE SUCH AN ADDICT.

672
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:35,859
- ( phone ringing ) - THAT'LL BE KEOKI.

673
00:42:35,859 --> 00:42:37,150
HELLO.

674
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:38,440
NO.

675
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:47,480
JAMES, NO DIPPING INTO THE COOKING SHERRY!

676
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,770
YEAH.

677
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:51,349
OH, OKAY.

678
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:56,510
YES, YES, THANK YOU.

679
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,800
BYE.

680
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,680
WAS THAT KEOKI?

681
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,549
WHAT DID HE SAY?

682
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:10,400
DID HE ASK ABOUT ME?

683
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,309
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

684
00:43:13,309 --> 00:43:14,400
IT WASN'T KEOKI.

685
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,770
IT WAS THE POLICE.

686
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:19,710
NOW GIVE ME MY K.
THE POLICE?

687
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:20,880
WHAT DID THEY WANT?

688
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,450
- STOP TRYING TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

689
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:26,310
- MICHAEL, TELL ME.

690
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:27,310
CHRISTINA'S DEAD.

691
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:31,460
NOW GIVE ME MY GODDAMN K.
MICHAEL, OH MY GOD.

692
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:36,240
COME ON, LET ME DO YOUR MAKE-UP.

693
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,990
WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE.

694
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:38,990
LATE?

695
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:41,710
HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT GOING OUT?

696
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:44,450
I'VE BEEN PLANNING THIS PARTY FOR MONTHS.

697
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:46,230
- CHRISTINA HAD NO RIGHT TO GO AND DIE ON
US.

698
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:47,230
- YOU GHOUL.

699
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:50,210
OH PLEASE, THE BEST SUPERSTAR IS A DEAD SUPERSTAR.

700
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,210
- STOP IT.

701
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:55,720
I MEAN IT!

702
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:14,460
- ( Freez screams )
MY FUCKING BUTT IS ON FIRE!

703
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:21,480
( laughs )
COME ON.

704
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:33,190
LET ME DO YOUR FACE.

705
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:44,900
WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE.

706
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,250
HI.

707
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,710
WELCOME TO CHICKEN BUN.

708
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:50,690
MAY I TAKE YOUR ORDER, PLEASE?

709
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:57,990
YES, I'D LIKE CHEESEBURGERS
AND FRENCH FRIES, PLEASE.

710
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:04,270
( hitting keys )
WILL THAT BE TO STAY OR TO GO?

711
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:06,819
TO STAY.

712
00:45:06,819 --> 00:45:08,650
WILL THERE BE ANYTHING TO DRINK WITH THAT?

713
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:15,950
HOW ABOUT ONE OF YOUR THICK AND CREAMY MILKSHAKES?

714
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:28,790
MY NAME'S RODNEY.

715
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:29,790
YOU CAN CALL ME ROD FOR SHORT.

716
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:30,790
HELLO, ROD.

717
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:31,790
( cheering )
DINNER'S SERVED.

718
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:32,790
DON'T BE SHY.

719
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:33,790
OH, I'M SORRY.

720
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:34,790
CHRISTINA'S DEAD!

721
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:35,790
RA LA DIDDLE DOO!

722
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:36,790
? YOU GOT TO WALK ?
? WALK ?

723
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:47,460
? WALK YOUR ASS DOWN THE RUNWAY, JETWAY ?
? WALK, WALK ?

724
00:45:47,460 --> 00:46:08,450
? MODELING IS AN UGLY BUSINESS...

725
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:12,650
?
MICHAEL.

726
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:16,839
- MICHAEL!

727
00:46:16,839 --> 00:46:29,743
- ( sirens wailing )
HEY, I GOT MY WINGS.

728
00:46:29,743 --> 00:46:30,743
THEN FLY AWAY HOME.

729
00:46:30,743 --> 00:46:41,079
THE POLICE 
ARE COMING.

730
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:42,079
( Rodney laughing ) HEY, HEY!

731
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:43,079
HEY!

732
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:44,079
DO YOU STILL WANT THAT MILKSHAKE?

733
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,079
OF COURSE.

734
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:46,079
TO GO.

735
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,079
Man LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MEET AMERICA'S FUTURE.

736
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:48,079
THE CLUB KIDS.

737
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,079
HERE THEY ARE.

738
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:50,079
- ( dance music playing ) - ( audience applauding
)

739
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:51,079
? YOU BETTER WORK, COVER-GIRL ?
? WORK IT, GIRL, GIVE A TWIRL ?

740
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:52,079
? DO YOUR THING ON THE RUNWAY ?
? WORK, SUPERMODEL ?

741
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:53,079
? WORK IT, GIRL, AROUND THE WORLD ?
? WET YOUR LIPS AND MAKE LOVE TO THE CAMERA

742
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:57,450

? WORK, TURN TO THE LEFT ?

743
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:08,650
? WORK, NOW TURN TO THE RIGHT ?

744
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:22,329
? WORK, TURN TO THE LEFT ?
? WORK, NOW TURN TO THE RIGHT...

745
00:47:22,329 --> 00:47:26,069
?
WHO INVITED HIM?

746
00:47:26,069 --> 00:47:27,099
- I DID.

747
00:47:27,099 --> 00:47:29,180
- WHATEVER FOR?

748
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:36,460
AND IT'S NOT EVEN OUR HALLOWEEN SHOW.

749
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:41,089
( weak laughter )
CLUB KIDS, SO WHAT DO YOU ACTUALLY DO?

750
00:47:41,089 --> 00:47:43,110
WE DON'T DO, WE JUST ARE.

751
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,850
BUT WHAT ABOUT WORK?

752
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:48,069
IT TAKES A LOT OF WORK TO LOOK THAT RIDICULOUS.

753
00:47:48,069 --> 00:47:50,970
WELL, MY WINGED VALKYRIE...

754
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:53,870
- HOW DO YOU SUPPORT YOURSELF?

755
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:56,080
- WELL I--
CAN'T YOU GUESS?

756
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,080
HE'S A DRUG DEALER.

757
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:01,360
- ( audience gasps ) - ( Michael laughs )
- NO, BUT SERIOUSLY?

758
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,950
- IT'S ALL JUST INNOCENT FUN.

759
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:04,420
THEY'RE NOT HURTING ANYONE.

760
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:06,450
LET THE CHILDREN PLAY.

761
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:14,140
WE'RE PARTYING WITH THE CLUB KIDS,
FAMOUS BECAUSE THEY'RE FABULOUS.

762
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:21,990
THAT'S SO COOL.

763
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:25,280
Man AND WE'RE CLEAR.

764
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,280
- MICHAEL, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

765
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,280
- IN JAIL.

766
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,280
NO, MY BABY BEHIND BARS?

767
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,260
ME AND RODNEY HIJACKED AND CRASHED A CAB.

768
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:31,859
- ANGEL BAILED ME OUT.

769
00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:32,920
- ANGEL?

770
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,170
ACTUALLY, ANGEL BAILED YOU OUT.

771
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:36,170
ME?

772
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:39,730
YEAH, I TOLD THE POLICE I WAS YOU.

773
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:43,950
OH, JAMES, IT'S JUST ALL IN FUN.

774
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:49,240
AND AFTER I TOLD THEM THAT YOU HAD AIDS
THEY GAVE ME MY OWN ROOM WITH A VCR AND ICE

775
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,240
CREAM.

776
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,210
( laughing )
MICHAEL, I DON'T EVEN LIKE YOU.

777
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:56,460
I HAVE NEVER LIKED YOU.

778
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:02,400
Man WE'RE BACK IN FIVE, FOUR,
- THREE.

779
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:08,559
- ( theme music plays )
SO, JUST WHAT IS A CLUB KID?

780
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,980
IT'S ALL ABOUT SELF-EXPRESSION.

781
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:14,500
IF YOU FEEL LIKE A TROLL, THEN YOU SHOULD
LOOK LIKE A TROLL.

782
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,120
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE.

783
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:21,350
I MEAN, IF YOU HAVE A HUNCHBACK
JUST THROW A LITTLE GLITTER ON IT, HONEY,

784
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:23,180
AND GO DANCING.

785
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,229
- AND YOU ARE?

786
00:49:24,229 --> 00:49:25,290
- HE'S A TROLL.

787
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:26,730
TROLL ST.

788
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:27,730
TROLL.

789
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:28,970
I AM JAMES ST.

790
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:30,690
JAMES, THE ORIGINAL.

791
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:33,380
THE ORIGINAL DRUG CHILD.

792
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:37,480
AS YOU CAN SEE, YEARS OF ABUSE
HAVE TAKEN ITS TOLL ON THE TROLL.

793
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,510
ALTHOUGH HE LOOKS MUCH OLDER,
HE JUST TURNED .

794
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:46,319
I AM
AND MICHAEL ALIG HAS STOLEN ALL OF MY IDEAS.

795
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:47,640
WHAT ABOUT THE FUTURE?

796
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:51,099
CAN YOU REALLY BE A CLUB KID IN YOUR s?

797
00:49:51,099 --> 00:49:53,840
ASK MY MOM.

798
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,060
WHY NOT?

799
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:58,109
MY SON IS A SUCCESS.

800
00:49:58,109 --> 00:50:02,579
AND HE STARTED OUT SELLING CANDY
FROM A LITTLE SHOEBOX AT SCHOOL

801
00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:06,180
AND NOW HE SENDS A STRETCH LIMOUSINE
FOR ME AT THE AIRPORT.

802
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:11,630
ISN'T IT TRUE, MA'AM, THAT YOUR SON MICHAEL
TURNED YOU ON TO THE PILL ECSTASY?

803
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:14,740
- ( audience murmuring ) - ( Michael chuckles
)

804
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:17,740
HE SAID IT WAS A HEADACHE PILL.

805
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:21,109
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU TOOK IT?

806
00:50:21,109 --> 00:50:24,950
MY HEADACHE WENT AWAY.

807
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:27,960
( laughing )
CLUB KIDS ARE CONDUCTING A NATIONWIDE TALENT

808
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,700
SEARCH
STARTING IN DALLAS NEXT WEEK.

809
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:31,830
THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE.

810
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:33,460
THESE ARE THE CLUB KIDS.

811
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:34,549
GOD BLESS YOU ALL.

812
00:50:34,549 --> 00:50:37,170
THANKS SO MUCH, MR.

813
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:38,170
CHICKEN.

814
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:39,170
GREAT.

815
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,440
THANK YOU, DEAR.

816
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,750
Great stuff.

817
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,719
Really liked it.

818
00:50:43,719 --> 00:50:49,280
( TV turns off )
I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE THEM, BUT THE PLACE

819
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,240
IS PACKED
ALMOST EVERY SINGLE NIGHT.

820
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,809
- THE KID IS DOING SOMETHING RIGHT.

821
00:50:52,809 --> 00:50:53,809
- MM-HMM.

822
00:50:53,809 --> 00:51:03,440
AND THAT'S GOING TO DO US A LOT OF GOOD WHEN
THE FEDS SHUT US DOWN.

823
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,570
- HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

824
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:07,900
- ANGEL, HAVE YOU GOT--
- MICHAEL, HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

825
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:08,900
- DO WHAT?

826
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,020
LIE ABOUT MY AGE TO THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES.

827
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:14,410
- ANGEL, I REALLY NEED-- - MICHAEL, IT'S TIME
TO GO.

828
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:15,410
I'VE GOT A DATE.

829
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:17,209
MOM, I CAN'T TAKE YOU TO THE AIRPORT.

830
00:51:17,209 --> 00:51:18,209
- I'M SICK.

831
00:51:18,209 --> 00:51:19,260
- NO, YOU'RE SICK?

832
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:21,059
WHAT'S--
OH, IT'S NOTHING.

833
00:51:21,059 --> 00:51:23,390
IT'S JUST HEROIN WITHDRAWAL.

834
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:24,720
MICHAEL.

835
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,050
MICHAEL!

836
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:32,710
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

837
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:33,910
- MY FAULT?

838
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:36,530
- ALL YOUR FAULT.

839
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:39,670
YOU-- YOU FEEDING MY CHILD DRUGS.

840
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:47,690
NO, DIDN'T YOU SEE...

841
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:52,690
COME ON, I'LL TAKE YOU TO PORT AUTHORITY.

842
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:55,530
I CAME IN A STRETCH LIMO.

843
00:51:55,530 --> 00:52:01,000
I'M NOT LEAVING IN A BUS.

844
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,950
I KNOW.

845
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:10,890
IT'S A TRAGEDY.

846
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:14,030
PAY YOU TO FLY AROUND THE COUNTRY RECRUITING
CLUB KIDS?

847
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:15,030
NO.

848
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:16,030
- THINK OF THE PRESS.

849
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:17,030
- THINK OF THE COST.

850
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:20,930
I BUY YOU AN APARTMENT, SET YOU UP WITH A
MAGAZINE,

851
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:23,319
PAY ALL YOUR BILLS AND STILL YOU WANT MORE.

852
00:52:23,319 --> 00:52:24,480
IT'S NEVER ENOUGH, IS IT?

853
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,410
IT'S A RECIPROCAL KIND OF RELATIONSHIP, YOU
KNOW, PETER?

854
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,260
FATHER-SON KIND OF THING?

855
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:35,099
AND ANOTHER THING,
YOUR DRUG USE IS BECOMING INDISCRIMINATE.

856
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:37,369
I WON'T DO CRACK WITHOUT HEROIN.

857
00:52:37,369 --> 00:52:38,740
COME HERE.

858
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:42,160
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

859
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,390
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

860
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:50,270
THEY'RE THE FEDS
AND THEY'RE WATCHING ME AROUND THE CLOCK.

861
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:53,230
THEY THINK I'M RUNNING SOME KIND OF DRUG SUPERMARKET.

862
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:54,849
OH, PETER, YOU'RE JUST PARANOID.

863
00:52:54,849 --> 00:52:57,250
YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS?

864
00:52:57,250 --> 00:53:02,549
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO HAVE ANY FUN.

865
00:53:02,549 --> 00:53:07,849
LOOK, I HAVE TO START PLAYING THE GAME.

866
00:53:07,849 --> 00:53:15,231
IF I WANT TO HAVE FUN, MICHAEL,
I'D GO AWAY ON A LITTLE...

867
00:53:15,231 --> 00:53:16,231
VACATION.

868
00:53:16,231 --> 00:53:28,250
I'D BOOK A HOTEL ROOM
AND I'D DISAPPEAR FOR A FEW DAYS.

869
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:34,650
IN FACT,
I'M PLANNING A VACATION QUITE SOON.

870
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:35,750
COULD I HAVE A LITTLE MORE?

871
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:42,390
YOU KNOW, FOR EXPENSES.

872
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:59,089
( dance music playing )
GOD,

873
00:53:59,089 --> 00:54:01,690
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE HERE IN DALLAS.

874
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:05,240
YOU LOOK JUST LIKE YOU DID ON TV.

875
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,539
THAT SHOW CHANGED MY LIFE.

876
00:54:07,539 --> 00:54:13,350
THERE YOU WERE JUST UP ON THAT SCREEN
AND FAMOUS FOR NO REASON.

877
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:16,940
I THOUGHT, OH MY GOD, THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO
DO.

878
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:19,299
I CRIED.

879
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:20,479
GOD.

880
00:54:20,479 --> 00:54:22,660
JUST WAIT TILL YOU TRY MY DRUG SALAD.

881
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:23,870
- WHERE'S KEOKI?

882
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:26,320
- HE DIDN'T MAKE HIS CONNECTION.

883
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,990
SOMETHING HE'S BEEN DOING FOR SOME TIME NOW.

884
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:34,000
A LITTLE SOMETHING, GENTLEMEN?

885
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,990
( chuckling ) NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL A GUARDIAN
ANGEL.

886
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:39,210
STICK WITH ME, ANGEL.

887
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:40,619
I'LL MAKE YOU A SUPERSTAR.

888
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:42,180
THANKS, SKROD.

889
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:46,079
THAT'S SKRINK-LA DOO TO YOU.

890
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:51,020
( laughs )
BROOKE, YOU SHOULD REALLY MOVE TO NEW YORK.

891
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:52,020
SHUT UP.

892
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:53,020
NEW YORK?

893
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:55,039
OH HON, HE SAYS THAT TO EVERYONE.

894
00:54:55,039 --> 00:54:57,690
SOME OF THEM ACTUALLY DO MOVE TO NEW YORK,
THE POOR THINGS.

895
00:54:57,690 --> 00:54:58,970
NO JOB, NOWHERE TO STAY.

896
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:01,930
IN THE TWINK OF AN EYE THEY ARE HOMELESS CRACK
ADDICTS

897
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:05,230
PROSTITUTING THEMSELVES ON THE STREETS FOR
A BUFFALO NICKEL.

898
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:06,359
DON'T LISTEN TO JAMES.

899
00:55:06,359 --> 00:55:08,319
HE'S SUFFERING FROM DEMENTIA.

900
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:09,319
DEMENTIA?

901
00:55:09,319 --> 00:55:10,319
I KNOW HER.

902
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:11,450
SHE'S A DRAG QUEEN, RIGHT?

903
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:13,260
CAN MY FRIEND GITSIE COME TOO?

904
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:17,720
HEY, GITSIE, COME OVER HERE.

905
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,510
COME HERE!

906
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:22,190
Brooklets GITSIE, MICHAEL.

907
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:23,969

908
00:55:23,969 --> 00:55:24,969

909
00:55:24,969 --> 00:55:25,969

910
00:55:25,969 --> 00:55:30,230

00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:31,329
OF COURSE, YOU CAN BOTH COME.

912
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:33,930
AND YOU CAN BE MY NEW GIRLFRIEND.

913
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:39,210
I CAN'T BELIEVE I JUST SAW YOU ON TV.

914
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,980
AND YOU CAN BOTH STAY WITH US.

915
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:45,119
James MICHAEL, ISN'T IT GETTING A LITTLE CROWDED
IN HOUR HUMBLE ABODE?

916
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:49,500

917
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,500

918
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,890
- BROOKE, AND THIS ONE?

919
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:55,320
OH, JAMES, IT'S NOT LIKE I SEE YOU PAYING
ANY RENT.

920
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:59,940
RE-- I COOK, I CLEAN,
I TAKE CARE OF YOUR MOTHER.

921
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,980
SALAD IS SERVED.

922
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:04,599

925
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:13,289
BUT WE DON'T HAVE A SHOW.

926
00:56:13,289 --> 00:56:14,289
WE DON'T DO ANYTHING.

927
00:56:14,289 --> 00:56:16,040
CURTAIN UP AT THE END OF THIS SONG.

928
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,040
Michael and James SONG?

929
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,040
Announcer LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
MANHATTAN'S ONLY CLUB KIDS.

930
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,040
( cheering )
( dance music playing )

931
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,040
GREETINGS CITIZENS.

932
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:31,049
WE ARE LIVING IN THE AGE
IN WHICH THE PURSUIT OF ALL VALUES

933
00:56:31,049 --> 00:56:41,329
OTHER THAN MONEY, SUCCESS,
FAME, GLAMOUR

934
00:56:41,329 --> 00:56:51,609
HAS EITHER BEEN DISCREDITED OR DESTROYED.

935
00:56:51,609 --> 00:56:58,460
MONEY, SUCCESS, FAME, GLAMOUR.

936
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:15,599
FOR WE ARE LIVING IN THE AGE OF THE THING.

937
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:22,450
MONEY, SUCCESS, FAME, GLAMOUR.

938
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:29,299
MONEY, SUCCESS, FAME, GLAMOUR.

939
00:57:29,299 --> 00:57:39,579
( all chanting ) MONEY, SUCCESS, FAME, GLAMOUR.

940
00:57:39,579 --> 00:57:46,440
MONEY, SUCCESS, FAME, GLAMOUR.

941
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,150
MONEY.

942
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:49,960
BLOOD FEAST?

943
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:50,960
LEGS CUT OFF?

944
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,930
MICHAEL, THIS IS SICK.

945
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:54,260
OF COURSE IT'S SICK.

946
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:56,460
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE SICK.

947
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:57,750
NO!

948
00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:00,680
BUT IT'S MY BIRTHDAY AND I WANT TO HAVE A
BLOOD FEAST.

949
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,599
OVER MY DEAD BODY.

950
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:05,799
IF YOU WANT YOUR MORTGAGE PAID, YOU WILL CHECK
YOURSELF INTO REHAB.

951
00:58:05,799 --> 00:58:08,510
BUT I CAN'T AFFORD TO.

952
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:14,740
I SAID I WOULD PAY.

953
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:18,470
DOES SHE SPEAK?

954
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:25,940
ONLY WHEN HE WANTS ME TO.

955
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:30,920
MY KIND OF GIRL.

956
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:36,450
ALL RIGHT LOOK,
IF YOU GET YOURSELF INTO A REHAB

957
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:40,140
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR BLOOD FEAST
AS A GOING-AWAY PRESENT.

958
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:41,140
THANK YOU, PETER.

959
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:42,140
I PROMISE.

960
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:43,140
OH, I'VE GOT SOMETHING FOR YOUR VACATION.

961
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:44,140
( Gitsie giggling )
TA-DAH!

962
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:45,140
BUGS.

963
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:46,140
BUGS.

964
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:47,140
I KNOW THEY'RE HERE SOMEWHERE.

965
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,140
HE'S OUT THERE.

966
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:49,140
Peter YOU THINK YOU'RE PETER PAN, MICHAEL.

967
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:50,140
BUT YOU'RE NOT.

968
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:51,140
I'M PETER.

969
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:52,140
AND I'M SITTING ON THE PAN.

970
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:53,140
( laughing )
( snorting )

971
00:58:53,140 --> 00:59:10,140
Michael I WAS JUST THINKING.

972
00:59:10,140 --> 01:00:22,250
I WAS JUST THINKING HOW NICE IT WOULD BE TO
BE IN CENTRAL PARK.

973
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:40,329
IN THE SUNSHINE.

974
01:00:40,329 --> 01:00:53,270
MICHAEL!

975
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:54,920
YOU AND ME.

976
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,940
Peter GITSIE!

977
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:00,980
- WITH AN ICE CREAM.

978
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:06,140
- IT'S LONELY IN HERE.

979
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:21,859
I WANT MY MONEY, MICHAEL.

980
01:01:21,859 --> 01:01:40,720
I FEEL SO GOOD RIGHT NOW.

981
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:48,960
Angel MICHAEL, I WANT MY MONEY.

982
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,760
( screaming )
MICHAEL, WAKE UP!

983

PEACH?

992
01:03:30,509 --> 01:03:32,660
( laughs )
OH MY GOD!

993
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:34,049
YOU'RE ALIVE!

994
01:03:34,049 --> 01:03:37,040
IT WAS SO NICE BEING DEAD.

995
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:38,549
LOOK AT YOU IN THAT E.R.

996
01:03:38,549 --> 01:03:39,549

OH MY GOD.

998
01:03:40,549 --> 01:03:43,400
I JUST GOT A GREAT IDEA.

999
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,400
THE EMERGENCY ROOM.

1000
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:49,030
WE'LL ALL GET DRESSED UP LIKE NURSES AND DOCTORS
AND GIVE OUT PRESCRIPTIONS FOR FREE DRUGS.

1001
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:54,220
KEOKI WILL DJ AND YOU CAN BE--
YOU CAN BE A SERIAL KILLER NURSE WITH THE

1002
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:55,220
ENEMA.

1003
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:56,220
MICHAEL, I CAN'T.

1004
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:57,220
- CAN I BE A MENTAL PATIENT?

1005
01:03:57,220 --> 01:03:58,619
- OF COURSE YOU CAN.

1006
01:03:58,619 --> 01:04:01,670
JAMES, DO YOU HAVE A BUMP OF K?

1007
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:04,660
I'M REALLY TRYING TO GET MY ACT TOGETHER AND
WRITE, MICHAEL.

1008
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:08,400
A BUMP OF K'S GOING TO KILL ME NOW, IS IT?
( laughs )

1009
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,910
COME ON, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

1010
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:14,630
MICHAEL, YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE.

1011
01:04:14,630 --> 01:04:21,289
YOU'RE ATTACHED TO THINGS.

1012
01:04:21,289 --> 01:04:22,950
MICHAEL!

1013
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:27,940
COME ON, JAMES.

1014
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:31,609
THE SHOW MUST GO ON.

1015
01:04:31,609 --> 01:04:40,220
( techno music playing )

1016
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:50,069
? SHE DOESN'T GET ENOUGH ?

1017
01:04:50,069 --> 01:04:59,920

1018
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:09,769

1020
01:05:19,609 --> 01:05:24,539
? SHE DOESN'T GET ENOUGH...

1021
01:05:24,539 --> 01:05:27,000
?
PARTY'S OVER.

1022
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:33,779
AND YOU CAN'T WALK AROUND HERE NAKED ANYMORE.

1023
01:05:33,779 --> 01:05:40,039
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.

1024
01:05:40,039 --> 01:05:43,789
Michael WHAT'S THIS?

1025
01:05:43,789 --> 01:05:46,529
- IT SAYS SEVERANCE PAY.

1026
01:05:46,529 --> 01:05:47,529
- MM-HMM.

1027
01:05:47,529 --> 01:05:48,789
WHERE'S PETER?

1028
01:05:48,789 --> 01:05:56,329
I THINK HE'S DONE EVERYTHING HE CAN FOR YOU,
MICHAEL.

1029
01:05:56,329 --> 01:06:03,059
HE'S NOT YOUR FATHER.

1030
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:09,640
PETER STILL LOVES ME MORE THAN HE LOVES YOU.

1031
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:10,880
I'M STILL FABULOUS.

1032
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:16,180
WHEN I LOOK INTO YOUR EYES, DO YOU WANT TO
KNOW WHAT I SEE?

1033
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:20,030
I SEE A POOR PATHETIC FRIGHTENED LITTLE BOY,
TOO SCARED TO FACE REALITY.

1034
01:06:20,030 --> 01:06:21,030
FABULOUS.

1035
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:29,349
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

1036
01:06:29,349 --> 01:07:19,150
WOW, MICHAEL, YOU LOOK LIKE SHIT.

1037
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:44,050
NO THANKS, MAN.

1038
01:07:44,050 --> 01:08:01,780
WHY WON'T YOU COME HOME?

1039
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:03,490
I MISS YOU.

1040
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:05,760
I MISS YOU, TOO.

1041
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,040
I LOVE YOU, MICHAEL.

1042
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:10,310
SO YOU'LL COME HOME?

1043
01:08:10,310 --> 01:08:17,140
THAT'D BE NICE BUT, YOU KNOW, MY SCHEDULE'S
JUST CRAZY RIGHT NOW.

1044
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:21,120
DAY AFTER TOMORROW I'M GOING TO ICELAND.

1045
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:35,240
THEN IBIZA
AND THEN MALAYSIA.

1046
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:58,609
I THINK I DROPPED A ROCK.

1047
01:08:58,609 --> 01:09:02,510
MICHAEL.

1048
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:03,510
I DROPPED TWO ROCKS.

1049
01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:04,510
MIKE, MICHAEL.

1050
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:05,510
I DROPPED A ROCK.

1051
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:06,510
LOOK ON THE FLOOR.

1052
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:07,510
LOOK IN THE CARPET.

1053
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:08,510
FIND THE ROCK.

1054
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:09,510
REMEMBER?

1055
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:10,510
THERE, MICHAEL.

1056
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:17,299
MICHAEL, CHECK BEHIND THE RADIATOR.

1057
01:09:17,299 --> 01:09:26,730
I THINK IT FELL BEHIND THE RADIATOR.

1058
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:28,299
OW!

1059
01:09:28,299 --> 01:09:31,450
MICHAEL, LOOK.

1060
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:37,730
YOU SEE THAT HOLE?

1061
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:49,710
THERE'S A HOLE BACK THERE AND THERE'S SOMETHING
IN THERE.

1062
01:09:49,710 --> 01:09:57,840
IF I CAN JUST REACH MY HAND.

1063
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:58,989
- ( squeaking ) - OW!

1064
01:09:58,989 --> 01:09:59,989
OW!

1065
01:09:59,989 --> 01:10:00,989
FUCK!

1066
01:10:00,989 --> 01:10:01,989
FUCK!

1067
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:02,989
FUCKING RAT!

1068
01:10:02,989 --> 01:10:03,989
I JUST GOT BIT BY A FUCKING RAT.

1069
01:10:03,989 --> 01:10:04,989
HUH.

1070
01:10:04,989 --> 01:10:05,989
WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

1071
01:10:05,989 --> 01:10:06,989
THAT'S NOT A CRACK HOLE.

1072
01:10:06,989 --> 01:10:07,989
THAT'S A RAT HOLE.

1073
01:10:07,989 --> 01:10:08,989
- RAT'S ON CRACK ATTACK.

1074
01:10:08,989 --> 01:10:09,989
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

1075
01:10:09,989 --> 01:10:10,989
OH, ANGEL.

1076
01:10:10,989 --> 01:10:13,260
WE DID ALL YOUR DRUGS AND WE NEED SOME MORE.

1077
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:21,840
YOU DID WHAT?

1078
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,000
WE DID ALL YOUR DRUGS AND WE NEED SOME MORE.

1079
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
NOW.

1080
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,560
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR ALL OF THIS.

1081
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,389
HOW ABOUT PAYING ME SOME RENT?

1082
01:10:31,389 --> 01:10:32,389
FOR WHAT?

1083
01:10:32,389 --> 01:10:33,389
HUH?

1084
01:10:33,389 --> 01:10:35,780
FOR ALL THE FUCKING DRUGS YOU'VE DONE FOR
FREE?

1085
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:37,719
FORGET IT.

1086
01:10:37,719 --> 01:10:40,780
OH, I GET IT.

1087
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:43,590
YOU'RE A NOBODY WHO I TURNED INTO A SOMEBODY.

1088
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:45,800
BECAUSE OF ME PEOPLE KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

1089
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,010
BECAUSE OF ME YOU GET TO GO ON TELEVISION.

1090
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:51,400
BUT THAT ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU BECAUSE
YOU THINK YOU'RE ABOVE IT.

1091
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:55,090
YOU AND YOUR TIRED OLD ANGEL WINGS.

1092
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:58,480
DON'T START WITH ME, MICHAEL.

1093
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:02,390
YOU'RE JUST SOME-- SOME LAME ASS
JOHNNY-COME-LATELY FAIRY FAGGOT COPYCAT.

1094
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:09,389

1095
01:11:09,389 --> 01:11:14,679
BUT STILL, NO HARD FEELINGS?

1096
01:11:14,679 --> 01:11:19,630

MERRY CHRISTMAS.

1097
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:21,280

1098
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,929

1099
01:11:22,929 --> 01:11:24,579

1100
01:11:24,579 --> 01:11:32,150

I DON'T MEAN TO BUTT IN HERE,

1101
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:35,400

1102
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:36,909

1104
01:11:39,929 --> 01:11:50,500
WHAT IS JAMES DOING IN MY BEDROOM?

1105
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:54,260
I'M SO OUT OF HERE.

1106
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:57,409
WAIT, YOU CAN'T LEAVE.

1107
01:11:57,409 --> 01:11:58,469
YOU PROMISED.

1108
01:11:58,469 --> 01:11:59,469
WE HAVE A PACT, REMEMBER?

1109
01:11:59,469 --> 01:12:00,469
( door shuts )
Man on TV It's a quarter past .

1110
01:12:00,469 --> 01:12:58,310
In the local news at this hour,
police have raided and closed The Limelight

1111
01:12:58,310 --> 01:13:07,020
nightclub
alleging it has become a drug den.

1112
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:23,870
No arrests were made, but narcotics agents...

1113
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:31,090
( sirens wailing )
( ringing )

1114
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:38,310
( phone ringing )
MICHAEL.

1115
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:40,720
MICHAEL.

1116
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:52,510
I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME.

1117
01:13:52,510 --> 01:14:06,460
I CAME, DIDN'T I?

1118
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:30,870
MICHAEL, I'M TAKING YOU TO REHAB NOW.

1119
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:37,840
OH, MICHAEL.

1120
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:51,790
OUR CAT IS DEAD.

1121
01:14:51,790 --> 01:15:02,260
( sobbing )
Angel MICHAEL!

1122
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:09,550
WHERE'S MY FUCKING MONEY?

1123
01:15:09,550 --> 01:15:15,340
YOU BETTER GIVE ME MY FUCKING MONEY, MICHAEL.

1124
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:28,570
'CAUSE I KNOW A LOT OF SHIT
THE COPS WOULD BE INTERESTED IN RIGHT NOW.

1125
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:32,090
BYE BYE, PETER GATIEN.

1126
01:15:32,090 --> 01:15:35,630
YOU FUCKING BASTARD SPIC!

1127
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:39,240
I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

1128
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,739
HE BROKE MY TEAPOT.

1129
01:15:40,739 --> 01:15:43,960
MY FAVORITE TEAPOT.

1130
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:46,889
IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.

1131
01:15:46,889 --> 01:15:49,550
JAMES?

1132
01:15:49,550 --> 01:16:02,830
( techno music playing )
Michael JAMES?

1133
01:16:02,830 --> 01:16:08,140
Michael JAMES!

1134
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:34,690
GODDAMN IT, WHY DOES EVERYONE GOT TO DIE ON
ME?

1135
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:42,659
( muffled voices )
( gasps )

1136
01:16:42,659 --> 01:16:52,510
( heart monitor beeping )
LET ME BE THE FIRST TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON

1137
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:53,510
YOUR FIRST OVERDOSE.

1138
01:16:53,510 --> 01:16:56,580
LET ME BE THE FIRST TO CONGRATULATE YOU.

1139
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:57,580
THAT WAS GENIUS.

1140
01:16:57,580 --> 01:17:00,070
ONLY YOU COULD DREAM UP SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

1141
01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:01,900
- DREAM UP WHAT?

1142
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:03,610
- LAST NIGHT'S PARTY.

1143
01:17:03,610 --> 01:17:06,090
IT WAS BETTER THAN A -INCH DICK AND YOU KNOW
IT.

1144
01:17:06,090 --> 01:17:09,180
WHEN ANGEL WAS LOWERED FROM THE CEILING, BOY
OH BOY.

1145
01:17:09,180 --> 01:17:13,070
AND TO THINK I BELIEVED YOU ACTUALLY KILLED
HIM.

1146
01:17:13,070 --> 01:17:14,580
I SWALLOWED IT HOOK, LINE AND SINKER, BUT
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

1147
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:17,380
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN YOU COULD NEVER KILL ANYONE.

1148
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:19,240
JAMES, YOU'RE DELIRIOUS.

1149
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:21,720
HERE, LISTEN TO THIS.

1150
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,690
MICHAEL MUSTO'S COLUMN.

1151
01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:25,570
"NIGHTCLUBBING" MR.

1152
01:17:25,570 --> 01:17:26,940
MESS...

1153
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:27,940

1154
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:29,760
DEALER ABOUT MONEY HE WAS OWED.

1155
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:30,760
MR.

1156
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:31,760
DEALER WAS CHOKING MR.

1157
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:32,760

01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:34,030
MESS # CAME IN
AND HIT MR.

1159
01:17:34,030 --> 01:17:35,480
DEALER OVER THE HEAD WITH A HAMMER."

1160
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:39,010
FABULOUS, YOU EVEN SUCKERED THE PRESS.

1161
01:17:39,010 --> 01:17:40,510
IT'S GENIUS.

1162
01:17:40,510 --> 01:17:44,300
JAMES, WOULD I LIE TO YOU?

1163
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:45,370
YES, ALL THE TIME.

1164
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:47,280
WELL, NOT THIS TIME.

1165
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:54,760
DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW I GOT RID OF THE
BODY?

1166
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:55,760
OKAY, MR.

1167
01:17:55,760 --> 01:18:01,700
PSYCHO KILLER, I'LL PLAY ALONG.

1168
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:04,400
SNUGGLE UP.

1169
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:07,440
Michael DAYS PASSED.

1170
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:11,540
WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

1171
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:15,120
SHUT UP.

1172
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:20,489
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

1173
01:18:20,489 --> 01:18:24,070
PLUMBING'S FUCKED.

1174
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:29,370
Michael AFTER ABOUT A WEEK OR SO
THE SMELL GOT SO BAD I SAID TO FREEZ...

1175
01:18:29,370 --> 01:18:32,290
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS TERRIBLE
MESS.

1176
01:18:32,290 --> 01:18:37,900
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

1177
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:41,140
BUT FREEZ ISN'T VERY GOOD IN THE DEAD BODY
DISPOSAL DEPARTMENT, NO SIREE.

1178
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:44,620
SO I SENT HIM TO MACY'S KITCHENWARE TO BUY
SOME KNIVES

1179
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:53,050
AND A TV BECAUSE WE NEEDED A BIG BOX.

1180
01:18:53,050 --> 01:19:03,570
I DID SO MUCH HEROIN THAT DAY, I HOPED IT
WOULD KILL ME.

1181
01:19:03,570 --> 01:19:08,420
BUT IT WAS EASY.

1182
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:24,070
THE MEAT JUST FELL AWAY
AND THE BONES JUST SNAPPED.

1183
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:28,370
WE PUT IT ALL INTO A BOX IN THE LIVING ROOM.

1184
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:32,260
AND AFTER A FEW MORE DAYS
WE THREW IT INTO THE RIVER

1185
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:40,909
AND IT FLOATED AWAY.

1186
01:19:40,909 --> 01:19:42,360
IT WASN'T LIKE HE WAS ALIVE OR ANYTHING.

1187
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:47,620
HE WAS TOTALLY DEAD.

1188
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:52,210
JAMES?

1189
01:19:52,210 --> 01:19:54,920
SAY SOMETHING.

1190
01:19:54,920 --> 01:20:04,670
MICHAEL, YOU HAVE TO TURN YOURSELF IN.

1191
01:20:04,670 --> 01:20:12,960
MICHAEL, WE HAVE TO GO.

1192
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:16,540
- WHAT'S SHE DOING HERE?

1193
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:17,540
- DON'T BE JEALOUS.

1194
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:19,719
WE'RE GOING TO REHAB RIGHT NOW.

1195
01:20:19,719 --> 01:20:20,870
IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE A HONEYMOON.

1196
01:20:20,870 --> 01:20:24,679
WE'LL START ALL OVER AGAIN.

1197
01:20:24,679 --> 01:20:26,820
NO DRUGS.

1198
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:27,889
NOTHING.

1199
01:20:27,889 --> 01:20:33,380
WE'RE GOING TO DRIVE CROSS COUNTRY,
SLEEP UNDER THE STARS,

1200
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:37,940
SWIM IN THE COOL CRYSTAL WATERFALLS.

1201
01:20:37,940 --> 01:20:39,520
JUST YOU AND ME.

1202
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:42,420
AND YOU'LL GET BETTER.

1203
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:45,600
AND EVERYTHING WILL ALL GET BETTER.

1204
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,780
HOW BUCOLIC.

1205
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:47,780
MICHAEL.

1206
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:49,160
I CAN'T PEE.

1207
01:20:49,160 --> 01:21:03,850
COME IN HERE.

1208
01:21:03,850 --> 01:21:21,010
IT'S NICE AND WARM.

1209
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:25,950
OH, GITSIE.

1210
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:35,830
EVERYTHING'S SUCH A MESS.

1211
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:43,240
DON'T WORRY, MICHAEL.

1212
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:58,070
PROMISE ME YOU'LL NEVER LEAVE ME.

1213
01:21:58,070 --> 01:22:03,010
I PROMISE.

1214
01:22:03,010 --> 01:22:11,010
( whispering ) YOU PROMISE.

1215
01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:27,610
I LOVE YOU.

1216
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:29,230
SKROD LA DA.

1217
01:22:29,230 --> 01:22:31,860
I CAN PEE AGAIN.

1218
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:35,560
ME TOO.

1219
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:39,260
( shrieks )
( knocking )

1220
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:42,960
Man HOUSEKEEPING.

1221
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:52,210
YOU NEED A TURN-DOWN SERVICE?

1222
01:22:52,210 --> 01:22:55,910
GO AWAY!

1223
01:22:55,910 --> 01:23:07,020
WE DON'T NEED ANY MORE TOWELS.

1224
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:14,420
( door crashing open )
- NO!

1225
01:23:14,420 --> 01:23:21,190
WHAT THE-- - SHH, SHH.

1226
01:23:21,190 --> 01:23:24,830
I'M SORRY.

1227
01:23:24,830 --> 01:23:28,170
I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO IT.

1228
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:29,170
HEY, HEY!

1229
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:30,900
JUST KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT, KIDDO.

1230
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:33,860
DO YOURSELF A BIG FAVOR.

1231
01:23:33,860 --> 01:23:35,000
NO!

1232
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,140
FUCKERS!

1233
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:41,840
Man LIKE "STAR WARS," MIKE.

1234
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:48,590
YOU'RE LUKE, A FORCE FOR THE GOOD.

1235
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:53,270
BUT SOMEHOW YOU HAVE BEEN CORRUPTED
BY A DARK POWERFUL FORCE.

1236
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:54,270
PETER GATIEN.

1237
01:23:54,270 --> 01:23:59,420
WE NEED YOU TO HELP US OVERTHROW THE EVIL
EMPEROR, YOU SEE?

1238
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:02,800
BUT HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

1239
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,739
WHAT ABOUT THE DRUGS AT THE CLUBS?

1240
01:24:04,739 --> 01:24:20,340
THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND THE PRIVATE PARTIES
AT HOTELS?

1241
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:33,090
LISTEN, MICHAEL, YOU HELP US
AND WE CAN TAKE CARE OF YOUR LITTLE...

1242
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:34,090
MISHAP.

1243
01:24:34,090 --> 01:24:35,090
- BUT IT WAS-- - WHAT, SELF-DEFENSE?

1244
01:24:35,090 --> 01:24:36,491
WE COULD BE LOOKING AT MURDER IN THE FIRST
DEGREE, PAL.

1245
01:24:36,491 --> 01:24:41,300
Man # NOW YOU THINK ABOUT THE BIG THINGS.

1246
01:24:41,300 --> 01:25:25,989
WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE LITTLE THINGS
TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES.

1247
01:25:25,989 --> 01:25:47,650
( knocking )
Michael SKROD LA DA DA.

1248
01:25:47,650 --> 01:26:06,780
( doorbell buzzing )
WANT TO BUY A CLOCK?

1249
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:11,989
MICHAEL, I--
I THOUGHT YOU'D BEEN ARRESTED.

1250
01:26:11,989 --> 01:26:13,710
YOU WISH.

1251
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:14,900
I NEED MONEY.

1252
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:18,510
WELL, MICHAEL, I'M BROKE.

1253
01:26:18,510 --> 01:26:23,170
AND I'VE GOT A STOMACH-ACHE.

1254
01:26:23,170 --> 01:26:25,050
WHAT'S THIS?

1255
01:26:25,050 --> 01:26:26,270
IS THIS YOUR MANUSCRIPT?

1256
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:28,320
- NO, MICHAEL, DON'T-- - THERE'S NOTHING HERE.

1257
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:32,199
OH, JAMES, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO BETTER
THAN THAT.

1258
01:26:32,199 --> 01:26:37,400
( doorbell buzzes )
OH, THAT'LL BE BILL AND BEN.

1259
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:38,400
I MADE A DEAL.

1260
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:42,210
I'M HELPING THE POLICE WITH THEIR INQUIRES.

1261
01:26:42,210 --> 01:26:43,210
ABOUT THE MURDER?

1262
01:26:43,210 --> 01:26:46,130
NO, SILLY, THE DRUG INVESTIGATION.

1263
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:47,130
IT'S FUN.

1264
01:26:47,130 --> 01:26:48,380
BILL AND BEN DON'T CARE ABOUT THE MURDER.

1265
01:26:48,380 --> 01:26:50,140
THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE ME ANONYMITY.

1266
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:51,429
- IMMUNITY.

1267
01:26:51,429 --> 01:26:52,719
- WHATEVER.

1268
01:26:52,719 --> 01:27:03,980
YOU KNOW, MICHAEL,
IF IT REALLY WAS SELF-DEFENSE THEN...

1269
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:05,420
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

1270
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:08,469
YOU CAN--
YOU SHOULD JUST TURN YOURSELF IN.

1271
01:27:08,469 --> 01:27:26,572
( doorbell buzzing )
OH, I'VE GOT TO GO.

1272
01:27:26,572 --> 01:27:30,080
MICHAEL, PETER WAS LIKE A FATHER TO YOU.

1273
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,731
HE GAVE YOU EVERYTHING.

1274
01:27:32,731 --> 01:27:35,440
HOW CAN YOU JUST RAT HIM OUT?

1275
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:42,830
OH, JAMES, I'M GETTING AWAY WITH MURDER AND
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS.

1276
01:27:42,830 --> 01:27:56,459
( thunder cracking )
- HELLO.

1277
01:27:56,459 --> 01:28:01,000
- HI.

1278
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:10,080
REMEMBER ME?

1279
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:14,630
NO.

1280
01:28:14,630 --> 01:28:16,770
REMEMBER CLARA THE CHICKEN?

1281
01:28:16,770 --> 01:28:18,199
ICY THE BEAR?

1282
01:28:18,199 --> 01:28:21,800
AND TIRESIAS THE RAT?

1283
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:26,370
NO, I DON'T REMEMBER YOU AT ALL.

1284
01:28:26,370 --> 01:28:31,590
YOU REALLY SHOULD STAY OFF THE K.
ANYWAY, I WAS THERE.

1285
01:28:31,590 --> 01:28:33,999
I SAW IT ALL.

1286
01:28:33,999 --> 01:28:34,999
- LOOK.

1287
01:28:34,999 --> 01:28:39,070
- ( TV turns on )
REMEMBER THAT CHRISTMAS WHEN FREEZ GOT BITTEN?

1288
01:28:39,070 --> 01:28:41,989
( laughing ) THAT WAS ME.

1289
01:28:41,989 --> 01:28:43,360
JUST A PLAYFUL LITTLE NIP.

1290
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,360
NOW WATCH.

1291
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:46,580
FAST FORWARD A LITTLE BIT.

1292
01:28:46,580 --> 01:28:50,240
SEE, THAT'S ANGEL'S ROOM.

1293
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:52,420
LOOK OVER THERE IN THE CLOSET.

1294
01:28:52,420 --> 01:28:54,080
THAT'S ANGEL'S STASH.

1295
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:57,630
AND LOOK WHAT WE GOT HERE.

1296
01:28:57,630 --> 01:29:01,179
GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER?

1297
01:29:01,179 --> 01:29:02,600
THAT'S MICHAEL.

1298
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,010
Rat MM-HMM.

1299
01:29:04,010 --> 01:29:05,429
NOW WATCH.

1300
01:29:05,429 --> 01:29:08,780
I'LL FAST FORWARD A LITTLE BIT.

1301
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:38,480
YOU FUCKING BASTARD SPIC!

1302
01:29:38,480 --> 01:30:07,820
( crashing )
( cracking )

1303
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:24,499
Rat NOW HERE'S WHERE IT GETS DISTURBING.

1304
01:30:24,499 --> 01:30:29,960
( pager beeping )
ALL RIGHT, SO SEE, HE'S NOT DEAD YET.

1305
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:30,960
HE'S NOT DEAD YET, JIMMY, 'CAUSE THEY'RE NOT
DONE.

1306
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:31,960
FIRST THEY STRIP HIM NAKED.

1307
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:32,960
AND THEN THE OLD PILLOW TRICK.

1308
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:34,450
AND THEN, THE PIECE DE RESISTANCE,
A DRANO INJECTION.

1309
01:30:34,450 --> 01:30:55,450
THAT STUFF IS USED TO UNCLOG PIPES, JIMMY,
NOT VEINS.

1310
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:59,650
STOP IT!

1311
01:30:59,650 --> 01:31:03,850
STOP IT!

1312
01:31:03,850 --> 01:31:14,350
( gasping )
Man SO, THIS RAT,

1313
01:31:14,350 --> 01:31:21,080
IT'S SITTING ON YOUR SOFA
- AND WHAT EXACTLY-- - ( phone ringing )

1314
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:22,770
EXCUSE ME.

1315
01:31:22,770 --> 01:31:23,770
- HELLO?

1316
01:31:23,770 --> 01:31:25,300
- Michael Skrink!

1317
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:26,300
SKROD!

1318
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:28,480
I'M JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF A TELEVISION INTERVIEW.

1319
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:29,960
- About what?

1320
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:31,179
- MY NOVEL.

1321
01:31:31,179 --> 01:31:32,900
PUBLISHED TODAY.

1322
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:35,219
IT'S CALLED "DISCO BLOODBATH" AND IT'S ALL
ABOUT YOU.

1323
01:31:35,219 --> 01:31:37,260
OH, JAMES, HOW TYPICAL.

1324
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:40,470
GO AND COMMIT YOUR OWN MURDER.

1325
01:31:40,470 --> 01:31:47,290
I WAS JUST TELLING THE STORY OF HOW I GOT
YOU ARRESTED.

1326
01:31:47,290 --> 01:31:49,880
WHAT?

1327
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:50,880
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'D DO THAT.

1328
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,400
WELL, YOU GAVE ME NO CHOICE.

1329
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,739
- BUT I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND.

1330
01:31:54,739 --> 01:31:57,570
- ISN'T THAT WHAT BEST FRIENDS ARE FOR?

1331
01:31:57,570 --> 01:32:00,190
JAMES CLARK, I COULD KILL YOU.

1332
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:04,610
( laughing )
You know,

1333
01:32:04,610 --> 01:32:08,750
PRISON ISN'T ALL THAT DIFFERENT FROM A NIGHTCLUB.

1334
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:12,190
EVERYTHING'S FOR FREE
AND I DON'T HAVE TO GET OUT OF BED IN THE

1335
01:32:12,190 --> 01:32:13,190
MORNING.

1336
01:32:13,190 --> 01:32:14,469
AND I CAN GET ALL THE DRUGS AND SEX I WANT.

1337
01:32:14,469 --> 01:32:19,680
AND AFTER GITSIE AND I GET MARRIED
WE CAN HAVE CONJUGAL VISITS.

1338
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:24,979
OH, MICHAEL, I'M SO SORRY.

1339
01:32:24,979 --> 01:32:29,130
- Now what?

1340
01:32:29,130 --> 01:32:35,340
- YOU DIDN'T HEAR?

1341
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:39,489
GITSIE'S DEAD.

1342
01:32:39,489 --> 01:32:43,640
An overdose.

1343
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:46,510
YOU SAVED MY LIFE, YOU KNOW.

1344
01:32:46,510 --> 01:32:47,600
THANK YOU.

1345
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:53,090
I'm afraid I'm going to have to hang up now.

1346
01:32:53,090 --> 01:32:54,090
WHY?

1347
01:32:54,090 --> 01:32:57,429
BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO TURN THIS INTO AN
AFTER SCHOOL SPECIAL.

1348
01:32:57,429 --> 01:32:59,820
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO GET THE LAST WORD AND
YOU WANT THIS TO END

1349
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:02,380
WITH EVERYONE LIKING YOU AND IT'S MY MOVIE.

1350
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:06,290
I CAN'T LET IT END THAT WAY.

1351
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:07,290
YOU ALWAYS KEPT OUR PACT.

1352
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:09,860
This is where I need to be.

1353
01:33:09,860 --> 01:33:12,880
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO, AND IT'S
NOT GOING TO WORK.

1354
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:15,300
GOODBYE, MICHAEL ALIG.

1355
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:24,080
( dial tone )
Man I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU STILL TALK TO HIM.

1356
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:27,550
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU HEARD OF A PEA
CHANGING ITS POD?

1357
01:33:27,550 --> 01:33:33,650
WELL, AT LEAST HE GAVE ME SOMETHING TO WRITE
ABOUT.

1358
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:35,370
CURED MY WRITER'S BLOCK.

1359
01:33:35,370 --> 01:33:42,679
? THE VOICE INSIDE MY HEAD SAID ?
? TAKE IT SLOW ?

1360
01:33:42,679 --> 01:33:50,809
? TEMPTATION'S GOT AHOLD OF ME ?
? AND I HEAR THEM SAY ?

1361
01:33:50,809 --> 01:33:53,940
? OH, EVERYTHING GOOD IS BAD ?
? EVERYTHING BAD IS GOOD ?

1362
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:55,239
? OH, EVERYTHING GOOD IS BAD ?
? AND EVERYTHING BAD IS GOOD ?

1363
01:33:55,239 --> 01:33:56,280
? EVERYTHING GOOD IS BAD ?
? EVERYTHING BAD IS GOOD ?

1364
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:57,329
? EVERYTHING GOOD IS BAD ?
? EVERYTHING BAD IS GOOD ?

1365
01:33:57,329 --> 01:33:58,369
? EVERYTHING GOOD IS BAD ?
? EVERYTHING BAD IS GOOD.

1366
01:33:58,369 --> 01:33:59,369
??
? SAILING THROUGH THE TOWN ?

1367
01:33:59,369 --> 01:34:40,249
? IN THE MORNING BY YOURSELF ?
? THERE'S A VERY SPECIAL FEELING ?

1368
01:34:40,249 --> 01:34:44,989
? A TRUE SENSATION ALL IS WELL ?
? IF YOU STAND AND RAISE YOUR ARMS OUT WIDE

1369
01:34:44,989 --> 01:34:47,349
?
? CLOSE YOUR EYES AND TRY TO FLY ?

1370
01:34:47,349 --> 01:34:50,729
? IT'S AN UNDERGROUND ILLUSION ?
? TRICKING YOU FROM SIDE TO SIDE ?

1371
01:34:50,729 --> 01:34:54,449
? WE KNEW ALL THE ANSWERS ?
? AND WE SHOUTED THEM LIKE ANTHEMS ?

1372
01:34:54,449 --> 01:34:57,829
? ANXIOUS AND SUSPICIOUS ?
? BET GOD KNEW HOW MUCH WE CHEATED ?

1373
01:34:57,829 --> 01:35:01,199
? IT CAN'T COME QUICKLY ENOUGH ?
? NOW YOU SPEND YOUR LIFE ?

1374
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:05,100
? WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT ?
? WHEN YOU FIND IT ?

1375
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:08,090
? IT'S ALREADY COME AND PASSED YOU BY ?
? AND LEFT YOU SO DEFEATED ?

1376
01:35:08,090 --> 01:35:10,580
? IT CAN'T COME QUICKLY ENOUGH ?
? NOW YOU SPEND YOUR LIFE ?

1377
01:35:10,580 --> 01:35:12,570
? WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT ?
? WHEN YOU FIND IT ?

1378
01:35:12,570 --> 01:35:15,560
? IT'S ALREADY COME AND PASSED YOU BY ?
? AND LEFT YOU SO DEFEATED ?

1379
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:17,959
? SKYSCRAPERS RISE BETWEEN US ?
? KEEPING ME FROM FINDING YOU ?

1380
01:35:17,959 --> 01:36:03,140
? IF THE CONCRETE ARCHITECTURE ?
? DISAPPEARED THERE'D BE SO FEW ?

1381
01:36:03,140 --> 01:37:26,409
? OF US LEFT TO NAVIGATE ?
? AND DEFEND OURSELVES FROM THE TIDE ?

1382
01:37:26,409 --> 01:37:34,719
? IT'S AN UNDERGROUND ILLUSION ?
? TRICKING YOU FROM SIDE TO SIDE ?

1383
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:36,019
? THERE'S NO INDICATION ?
? OF WHAT WE WERE MEANT TO BE ?

1384
01:37:36,019 --> 01:37:37,329
? SUCKING UP TO STRANGERS ?
? THROWING WISHES TO THE SEA ?

1385
01:37:37,329 --> 01:37:41,430
? IT CAN'T COME QUICKLY ENOUGH ?
? NOW YOU SPEND YOUR LIFE ?

1386
01:37:41,430 --> 01:37:44,700
? WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT ?
? WHEN YOU FIND IT ?

1387
01:37:44,700 --> 01:37:49,610
? IT'S ALREADY COME AND PASSED YOU BY ?
? AND LEFT YOU SO DEFEATED ?

1388
01:37:49,610 --> 01:37:53,700
? IT CAN'T COME QUICKLY ENOUGH ?
? NOW YOU SPEND YOUR LIFE ?

1389
01:37:53,700 --> 01:37:56,969
? WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT ?
? WHEN YOU FIND IT ?

1390
01:37:56,969 --> 01:38:01,890
? IT'S ALREADY COME AND PASSED YOU BY ?
? AND LEFT YOU SO DEFEATED. ?
