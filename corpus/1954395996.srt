Hey.

356
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,673
Jonah?
Nic.

357
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,676
Jonah!
Nic!

358
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:03,832
Oh, my God! Jonah,
where are you?

359
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:06,416
I don't know.
I'm locked up,
I'm in a room.

360
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:08,819
Me, too.
I'm in a locked room, dude.

361
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:10,153
Where are we?

362
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:12,089
I heard them say
we're not allowed
above ground

363
00:33:12,091 --> 00:33:14,291
because we were contaminated.

364
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:17,027
What the hell was Nomad?
What have they told you?

365
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:19,129
Not much.

366
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:23,200
I saw Haley.
She's in a coma
or something.

367
00:33:23,202 --> 00:33:26,203
Nic, they're doing
some weird shit here, man.

368
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:29,373
My body doesn't feel right.

369
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,209
Nic, I gotta go.

370
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:34,011
What? Where?

371
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:35,779
This place is run like a clock.

372
00:33:35,781 --> 00:33:38,448
I can't believe
you're in the vent!

373
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,617
What?
Dude, I'm not in the vent.

374
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:43,520

376
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,794
Why don't you have
any clocks that work?

377
00:33:50,796 --> 00:33:52,662
Clocks that work?

378
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:54,498
Yeah. The one
in the hallway is
stuck at 12:30.

379
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,740
Which hallway?

380
00:33:55,764 --> 00:33:57,334
Seven windows back.
Left turn.

381
00:33:57,336 --> 00:33:59,416
Four windows. Right turn.
Two windows on the right.

382
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,375
Next to the bathroom
with its sign upside down.
It's stuck at 12:30.

383
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:04,941
Nic, it's a broken clock.

384
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:09,146
Thank you for bringing it
to my attention.

385
00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:12,582
Can we please proceed
with the shapes and colors?

386
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,838
Screw this.
This is stupid.

387
00:34:15,862 --> 00:34:17,988
What's the matter, Nic?
Can't you do it?

388
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:19,322
No, I choose not to do it.

389
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:21,044
Choose?
You choose not to do it?

390
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:24,361
That sounds like pride talking.

391
00:34:24,363 --> 00:34:26,663
False and foolish pride.
That's all.

394
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:39,876
And the...
Cube, blue.
Sphere, green.

395
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:41,578
The blue tile
here that says "Zero"

396
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,180
corresponds with the green cube.

397
00:34:43,182 --> 00:34:44,881
The yellow tile
here that says "Six"
goes with the cube.

398
00:34:44,883 --> 00:34:47,443
The green tile here
that says "Five" goes
with the yellow pyramid.

399
00:34:47,467 --> 00:34:49,519
The green cube
goes with
the blue shaped cube.

400
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:51,354
The yellow written sphere
goes with
the green-shaped sphere.

401
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:53,290
The blue written pyramid
goes with
the yellow-shaped pyramid.

402
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:55,025
"Blue," written in yellow,
"yellow," in green,

403
00:34:55,027 --> 00:34:57,194
correspond the visible
colors and shapes rather
than the written words

404
00:34:57,196 --> 00:34:58,762
because the spectral
quality of light

405
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,444
is more objective, so to speak,

406
00:35:00,468 --> 00:35:03,229
than the written
English words
of those colors.

407
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:05,802
I see.

408
00:35:05,804 --> 00:35:07,804
You see?
What do you mean, you see?

409
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:10,140
You, Nic.

410
00:35:10,142 --> 00:35:11,975
I see you and I
think I'm beginning

411
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:13,910
to understand
something more about you.

412
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:15,479
Understand what?

413
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,950
The colors, the shapes,
they have an effect on you.

414
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:21,918
I'd say it was
an emotional effect,
wouldn't you?

415
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,553
I don't care about
the shapes and colors,

416
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:26,316
they don't mean
anything to me.
They don't mean shit to me!

417
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,907
You're the one
that's infuriating me,
you quack!

418
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:30,961

419
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:33,130
"Quack."

420
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:37,501
I wanna see Haley

421
00:35:37,503 --> 00:35:41,004
and I'm not gonna
say another word
until you let me see her.

422
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:44,741
Okay, Nic.

423
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,785
There's nothing on here.

424
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:57,921
She's in a coma, Nic.

425
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:02,559
There's nothing
that can be done
for her right now.

426
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,328
I promise,
as soon as she wakes up,

427
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,931
you'll be
the first one to see her.

Nic, it was hard to
put all this together,

435

but, you know, I think
we're sick, or infected.

436
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:10,093
Hey, Jonah, stop thinking
like that, man. Seriously.

437
00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:13,163
No, they're trying to keep
whatever's inside us
from metastasizing.

438
00:37:13,165 --> 00:37:14,397
Jonah, stop.

439
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,666
Nothing's metastasizing, okay?

440
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:18,748
We're fine.
We're gonna be fine.
No, I'm not.

No, my body is not.

Yeah. I'll help.
Okay.

NIC: <i> I'm sorry.</i>

885
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:48,976
(MOUTHING) I love you.

886
01:26:27,715 --> 01:26:28,782
(NIC SCREAMING)

887
01:26:30,485 --> 01:26:32,252
NIC: Haley!

888
01:27:40,521 --> 01:27:42,401
DAMON: Don't even
think about it, Nic.

889
01:27:43,591 --> 01:27:45,092
You can't reach her.

890
01:27:53,868 --> 01:27:55,068
<i>On my side.</i>

891
01:27:59,407 --> 01:28:01,567
Take a look at yourself, Nic.

892
01:28:03,244 --> 01:28:05,812
The perfect integration
of human will

893
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:11,018
and alien technology.

894
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:14,988
Our finest achievement.

895
01:28:21,829 --> 01:28:23,130
Nomad?

896
01:28:26,334 --> 01:28:28,068
Nomad!

897
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:32,773
Nomad, yes.
I brought you here.

898
01:28:32,775 --> 01:28:37,144
But remember, Nic,
you were the one who
came looking for me.

899
01:28:37,146 --> 01:28:40,113
So you might want
to ask yourself,

900
01:28:40,115 --> 01:28:43,417
"Did I find what I was
looking for?"

901
01:29:19,153 --> 01:29:20,153
(INAUDIBLE)

902
01:29:53,588 --> 01:29:55,055
(CLANKING)

903
01:30:35,296 --> 01:30:36,763
(GASPING)

904
01:32:00,815 --> 01:32:03,350
(CLANKING)
