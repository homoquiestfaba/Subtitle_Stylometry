1
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,690
- [Vincent] Life can
be so very complicated.

2
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,559
We can't see the forest for the trees,

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,349
and we're left to wander aimlessly.

4
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,329
(Multiple voices at once)

5
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,799
I'm coming home.

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,289
I have a destination.

7
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,707
My dear, Krystal.

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,945
That's what dad wanted.

9
00:00:34,946 --> 00:00:35,854
I miss him.

10
00:00:35,855 --> 00:00:38,211
People staring at me and wanting answers.

11
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:39,943
I want to help them, I really do.

12
00:00:39,944 --> 00:00:44,040
But I'm just as wretched
and hopeless as any of them.

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,258
Dear sister, I worry about you.

14
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:49,102
And I'm just supposed to.

15
00:00:49,103 --> 00:00:50,639
I wish that you would come
here and experience it.

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,620
Make everything better.

17
00:00:51,621 --> 00:00:54,499
During our last conversation
dad prayed for me.

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,949
He prayed that I'd repent.

19
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,129
Maybe you did move.

20
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,212
It's been five months.

21
00:00:59,213 --> 00:01:01,559
Who's going to hire a guy
with a theology degree?

22
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,336
I don't know if I ever told you that.

23
00:01:03,337 --> 00:01:06,043
I'm kinda surprised that I
haven't heard back from you yet.

24
00:01:06,044 --> 00:01:07,709
I need to hear from my sister.

25
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,713
I just need you to say something.

26
00:01:09,714 --> 00:01:11,064
In the of course one night,

27
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,493
I managed to destroy my entire life.

28
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,109
Look, you're my sister, I
mean, we're still family.

29
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,334
Since dad died.

30
00:01:20,335 --> 00:01:21,692
It's scary to think that I am.

31
00:01:21,693 --> 00:01:23,191
Self-actualization

32
00:01:23,192 --> 00:01:25,760
is not even possible
for a pastor, because,

33
00:01:25,761 --> 00:01:29,079
their entire life is
dedicated to self-denial.

34
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,479
Sin tastes really sweet, doesn't it?

35
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,853
They can put their
identity into something.

36
00:01:35,143 --> 00:01:37,909
And I feel like God has forsaken me.

37
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,102
It's our job to guide people
through this wilderness.

38
00:01:40,103 --> 00:01:41,619
How can you be so cold, huh?

39
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,279
Please.

40
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,586
And we have to do it perfectly.

41
00:01:44,587 --> 00:01:46,069
We had a fight, that's all.

42
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,882
I am held accountable by God.

43
00:01:47,883 --> 00:01:49,656
You just shut me out.

44
00:01:49,657 --> 00:01:51,199
I can't have them go on some witch hunt.

45
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,426
It's like they're feeding on me.

46
00:01:53,427 --> 00:01:54,569
God knows what they would find.

47
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,739
At least they get to say
that they're fucked up.

48
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,610
That's not right.

49
00:01:57,611 --> 00:01:58,809
You don't give a shit.

50
00:01:58,810 --> 00:01:59,810
It's not fair.

51
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,349
Even a pastor needs a confessional,

52
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,479
and I think that's what
these letters have become.

53
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,289
I can see how truly pathetic my life is.

54
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,829
Please talk to me.

55
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,519
I just wanna float away with the current.

56
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,376
I don't know how much longer I can last.

57
00:02:12,377 --> 00:02:15,279
Go somewhere new, but I know that I can't.

58
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,513
Please say something.

59
00:02:18,081 --> 00:02:20,664
(somber music)

60
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,510
'Cause this your real life, Vincent.

61
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,920
These are the choices you
made, and that's all you have.

62
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,590
- Oh great, here we go.

63
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:52,924
One, two, three.

64
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:55,459
Oh, it's so cute.

65
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:57,844
Perfect.

66
00:02:58,931 --> 00:03:00,652
That's great.

67
00:03:00,653 --> 00:03:02,652
Their very first Christmas.

68
00:03:02,653 --> 00:03:04,220
- I know.

69
00:03:04,221 --> 00:03:07,721
- I think it's supposed to be right there.

70
00:03:09,428 --> 00:03:10,211
- See you guys.

71
00:03:10,261 --> 00:03:11,094
- Bye, we'll see you next week.

72
00:03:11,095 --> 00:03:12,699
Thanks again.
- It was nice to see you.

73
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,759
- How's your mother doing?

74
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,083
- [Woman] She's been doing all right.

75
00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:16,161
She's getting a little better.

76
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:20,069
But, thanks for asking.
- We've been praying.

77
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,699
We wanna see her back here

78
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,889
so that she can praise you again, amen.

79
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:25,673
- Thank you, Pastor.

80
00:03:25,723 --> 00:03:26,506
- Yeah, of course.

81
00:03:26,556 --> 00:03:27,457
- Amen.

82
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:28,290
- Have a wonderful day.

83
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,173
- You too.

84
00:03:29,174 --> 00:03:30,976
- Thank you.

85
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,299
(sighing)

86
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,717
(soft music)

87
00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:24,919
And by the way, when did
the hot seat become a thing?

88
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,260
- Gosh, we don't speak
of that atrocity here.

89
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:30,289
I'm surprised we haven't been
sued by a parent, actually.

90
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,837
- It's not like they'd get very far.

91
00:04:32,838 --> 00:04:33,919
(knocking on door)

92
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,920
Come in.

93
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,169
- How's the writing, gentlemen?

94
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,909
- Someone keeps stalling.

95
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,010
- Hey now, I'm the one still sitting here.

96
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,339
- Oh, after this I need to go
pick up those new tablecloths

97
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,439
for the dinner tonight, is that okay?

98
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,859
- Yeah, if we need 'em.

99
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,709
Also, could you make sure that
we're locked up really well?

100
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:58,209
Wally found a homeless person
sleeping in here this morning.

101
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,199
- It's that side door,
it refuses to latch,

102
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,633
but yes, of course.

103
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,159
- Was there something else, Edith?

104
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,039
- [Edith] It's about Katie,

105
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,719
I know it's really not my place...

106
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,720
- You're right.

107
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,689
- I really think you should call her.

108
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,219
I mean, she's alone, she's pretty,

109
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,063
she serves the church every
week, and she loves the Lord.

110
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,947
- Please count the money, Edith.

111
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,950
- Vincent.

112
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,187
- You are vicious, you know it?

113
00:05:40,188 --> 00:05:41,188
- Thank you.

114
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,859
- Now that right there, that
is how you stand your ground.

115
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,800
Yes, sir.

116
00:05:48,801 --> 00:05:50,569
- Shut up.

117
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,669
- She cares about you, Vincent.

118
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,969
You know, having a wife
isn't such a bad thing,

119
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,700
even I got one.

120
00:05:57,701 --> 00:05:58,600
(chuckling)

121
00:05:58,601 --> 00:06:00,250
- Yeah, well, I like being alone.

122
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,360
- Don't fool yourself.

123
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,974
All right, now what?

124
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:18,129
- I got an appointment
with Josh and Laurel,

125
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,779
you know, pastor stuff.
What the church pays me for.

126
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,189
- All right, well, I hope
you know I'm taking credit

127
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,889
for this book we're never gonna write.

128
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,472
- Yeah, you do that.

129
00:06:27,473 --> 00:06:29,723
(scoffing)

130
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:33,416
(stereo playing)

131
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:37,219
(ringing in ears)

132
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,020
(ringing subsiding)

133
00:07:17,035 --> 00:07:19,452
(suspenseful music)

134
00:07:29,075 --> 00:07:29,915
- [Woman] Krystal.

135
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,399
- Fucking bullshit.

136
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,795
- Krystal.

137
00:07:32,796 --> 00:07:33,629
(gasping)

138
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,272
- God fucking dammit.
- What the fuck?

139
00:07:36,273 --> 00:07:38,503
- [Woman] Krystal, stop freaking out.

140
00:07:38,504 --> 00:07:39,539
What the fuck?

141
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,639
- [Krystal] Are you serious?

142
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,265
I'm not gonna fucking stick
around and take this, I'm not!

143
00:07:43,266 --> 00:07:44,049
- Hey.

144
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:44,882
- No.

145
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:45,765
- What is this, what is this?

146
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:47,338
- I'm fucking done.

147
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:48,172
I am fucking done,

148
00:07:48,173 --> 00:07:49,819
Rene.
- Oh, you're done?

149
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,653
Oh, this is
- I'm fucking done.

150
00:07:50,654 --> 00:07:52,112
- Your big grand exit?
- Yeah, I'm done.

151
00:07:52,113 --> 00:07:53,530
- Hello, Krystal!

152
00:08:06,908 --> 00:08:09,020
- You dumb bitch.

153
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,854
(people chatting)

154
00:08:17,991 --> 00:08:20,390
Oh, hey, could I just...

155
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,957
What, am I fucking invisible?

156
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:30,623
- Don't go for that one, he
only serves the hot guys.

157
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,169
- Bullshit.

158
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,373
- No, it's true.

159
00:08:35,743 --> 00:08:36,819
Hey, check it out.

160
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,203
Hey sexy, can I get a drink over here?

161
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:41,974
- What'll it be?

162
00:08:42,024 --> 00:08:42,857
(stammering)

163
00:08:42,858 --> 00:08:44,019
- I got it.

164
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,999
I'll have whatever the hell I
just had, and she'll have...

165
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,493
- Whatever's most expensive.

166
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,680
- Ouch.

167
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,633
- And make it efficient.

168
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,940
- You set yourself up
for that one, hot shot.

169
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:00,852
- I told you.

170
00:09:00,902 --> 00:09:01,735
- Yeah.

171
00:09:01,736 --> 00:09:03,194
- I told you.

172
00:09:03,195 --> 00:09:04,389
You little fucker, though.

173
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,589
The most expensive one, really?

174
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,809
- Yeah.

175
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,603
- That's okay, you got
me and I'll take it.

176
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,723
I'm JD, what's your name?

177
00:09:13,776 --> 00:09:16,222
- Ooh, none of your business.

178
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,189
- None of my business?

179
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,190
Come on.

180
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,009
I just bought you a drink.

181
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,360
At least give me your name.

182
00:09:25,068 --> 00:09:27,043
- I mean could, but.

183
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,030
- Ha.

184
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:37,379
Shit, you good.

185
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,450
She's good.

186
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,779
- This is a blessing.

187
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,880
- It's why we're here.

188
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,190
How is he?

189
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,063
- He has good days,
but mostly they're bad.

190
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,950
- Do you think I could see him?

191
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,049
- I'll check, he knew you were coming.

192
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,050
- Thank you.

193
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,680
Has it been this way most of your life?

194
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,940
These waves?

195
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,270
- Most of it.

196
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,610
Since high school at least.

197
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,850
- What happened in high school?

198
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,550
- It doesn't matter.

199
00:11:16,045 --> 00:11:17,212
- Fair enough.

200
00:11:23,122 --> 00:11:24,322
Do you have any savings?

201
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:29,233
A way to pay bills until
you get back on your feet?

202
00:11:29,234 --> 00:11:30,234
- It won't help.

203
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,123
- What, savings?

204
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,890
- Getting back on my feet.

205
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,380
- Why?

206
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:43,690
- Look,

207
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,957
Pastor, thank you.

208
00:11:47,751 --> 00:11:49,163
But you're not a psychiatrist.

209
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,570
- Thank you.

210
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:04,239
Look Josh, I'm not
really a fan of how often

211
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,593
titles are thrown around.

212
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,939
It's as though they're trying
to remove the spiritual

213
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,890
from things and just make it so simple.

214
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,763
Anguish isn't simple.

215
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,269
And, I don't know, without
God, there would be no purpose

216
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,270
to the pain.

217
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,910
- I suppose.

218
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,743
- Look, we all feel it at times.

219
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,703
Sometimes the pain is small.

220
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,390
And sometimes it,

221
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,043
it hits us like a tsunami.

222
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,793
But we need to believe that it will pass.

223
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,320
- How?

224
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,780
Why hasn't it?

225
00:13:11,137 --> 00:13:12,939
- You know the story of Job?

226
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,723
In it...

227
00:13:13,773 --> 00:13:14,773
- I know the story.

228
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,360
- Of course.

229
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,979
- Baby, I think that Pastor Vincent is...

230
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,980
- Sorry.

231
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:30,520
Josh have you ever sat,
maybe in a quiet room

232
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,120
and heard the voice of God?

233
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,550
- No.

234
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:40,793
- Never?

235
00:13:40,843 --> 00:13:41,676
- No.

236
00:13:41,677 --> 00:13:42,789
- Not even a little?

237
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,790
- Have you?

238
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,453
See, I've tried.

239
00:13:54,527 --> 00:13:55,527
Nothing.

240
00:14:26,395 --> 00:14:29,395
(suspenseful music)

241
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,573
- [Krystal] You're only good for a fuck.

242
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,827
Nobody cares about you.

243
00:15:25,642 --> 00:15:27,809
You're a fucking train wreck.

244
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:54,542
(ringing in ears)

245
00:16:47,518 --> 00:16:50,601
(cell phone ringing)

246
00:17:24,942 --> 00:17:27,192
(retching)

247
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:06,791
- Shit.

248
00:18:18,435 --> 00:18:19,435
Edith?

249
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,229
Jesus, fuck.

250
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,679
Hey, what are you doing?

251
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,849
- Goddammit, Vincent.

252
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,051
- Are you drunk?

253
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:39,835
- What?

254
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:40,840
No, I wanted to see you.

255
00:18:40,841 --> 00:18:42,029
- You fucking are, aren't you?

256
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,739
- I fucking wanted to see you.

257
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,369
- So you break into my church?

258
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,973
- I didn't break in,
it was open, the door.

259
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,846
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, this
is stupid, I'm gonna go.

260
00:18:53,847 --> 00:18:54,886
Fucking, such a bad move.

261
00:18:54,887 --> 00:18:56,629
- Bullshit, you're not going anywhere.

262
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,572
- Okay, well, you can't
tell me what to do.

263
00:18:58,573 --> 00:18:59,460
- You know, I could call the cops on you

264
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:00,760
for breaking and entering?

265
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,520
- Touche.

266
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:05,770
Bitch.

267
00:19:06,655 --> 00:19:07,905
(both laughing)

268
00:19:07,906 --> 00:19:09,899
- You are so stupid.

269
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,679
- I'm not that stupid.

270
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,879
- You are trouble, is what you are.

271
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,663
Come on.

272
00:19:14,713 --> 00:19:15,546
- I am definitely trouble.

273
00:19:15,547 --> 00:19:17,039
- You are definitely trouble.

274
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,873
Come on.

275
00:19:17,874 --> 00:19:18,892
- But it is a really pretty church.

276
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:20,919
- Do you know how embarrassing this is?

277
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,753
If anybody else caught you in here

278
00:19:21,754 --> 00:19:23,249
I could be in serious trouble.

279
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,159
- Oh, but you're the boss.

280
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,943
You're in charge.

281
00:19:25,993 --> 00:19:26,826
- That's not how it works in the church.

282
00:19:26,827 --> 00:19:28,010
- It's good to see you.

283
00:19:29,889 --> 00:19:30,672
I love you.

284
00:19:30,722 --> 00:19:31,722
- Oh my God.

285
00:19:32,508 --> 00:19:34,159
- You got any snacks in here?

286
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,273
- Well, there's like, wafers.

287
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,903
Seriously, this isn't okay, Krystal.

288
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:46,469
- Dude, the last thing I need
is you judging me right now.

289
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,533
- How the hell did you
even find your way here?

290
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:55,317
- You should try technology,
it's pretty fucking awesome.

291
00:19:55,318 --> 00:19:56,318
- I meant...

292
00:19:57,986 --> 00:20:01,537
Nevermind what I meant, here,
eat, you need something.

293
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,723
- It's meat.

294
00:20:04,606 --> 00:20:05,672
(scoffing)

295
00:20:05,673 --> 00:20:06,840
- You need it.

296
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:11,407
What are you doing here?

297
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:15,901
(scoffing)

298
00:20:24,573 --> 00:20:26,973
- Probably not how you
expected to see me again.

299
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,503
Shit faced and what not.

300
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,768
What?

301
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:36,186
- Well, actually.

302
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:38,712
- You're an asshole.

303
00:20:38,713 --> 00:20:41,045
(chuckling)

304
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,389
- Seriously, eat.

305
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,723
- Seriously, it's gross.

306
00:20:48,891 --> 00:20:49,724
- Eat it.

307
00:20:49,725 --> 00:20:52,124
- This is so gross.

308
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,292
(sighing)

309
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,763
That's disgusting.

310
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,773
- Okay, come on.

311
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,623
You need to get some rest.

312
00:21:27,624 --> 00:21:29,849
- This is stupid, I should go.

313
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:30,790
I'm dumb, I'm stupid,

314
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,623
I wanna go.
- No, you're not

315
00:21:31,673 --> 00:21:32,506
going anywhere.

316
00:21:32,507 --> 00:21:33,980
Here, come on, here, take that off.

317
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,773
- Fucking stop. I got it.

318
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,020
Perv.

319
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,439
- Okay, do you want a clean shirt?

320
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,490
- I just wanna sleep.

321
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,203
- Here, cover up.

322
00:22:02,128 --> 00:22:02,975
(groaning)

323
00:22:03,025 --> 00:22:04,025
- I'm hot.

324
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
- Okay, okay.

325
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,690
Hey, there's water next to you, okay?

326
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,777
I'll be on the couch if you need anything.

327
00:22:12,778 --> 00:22:15,445
- [Krystal] Vincent, I love you.

328
00:22:19,203 --> 00:22:20,286
- Good night.

329
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,543
- [Krystal] My sweet, sweet Vincent.

330
00:24:24,836 --> 00:24:27,253
(soft music)

331
00:26:13,687 --> 00:26:17,270
(cell phone alarm blaring)

332
00:27:21,843 --> 00:27:25,089
- I mean, you're right,
it's only a amount of time.

333
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,246
- Right, time heals all wounds.

334
00:27:26,247 --> 00:27:28,779
- It's okay, exactly.

335
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,219
- Hey good looking.

336
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,378
You have that rough of a night?

337
00:27:32,379 --> 00:27:34,643
- Don't start with me now.

338
00:27:34,644 --> 00:27:37,119
You know if we have any
good leftovers in here?

339
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,120
- I don't know.

340
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:41,683
Hey, talk to me, what's up?

341
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,363
- Nothing, I just didn't
sleep well, again.

342
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:49,610
- Now that's a lie.

343
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,679
- Where's Ethan?

344
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,639
- He's around here somewhere.

345
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,570
- [Vincent] Somewhere?

346
00:27:56,571 --> 00:27:59,400
- I think he's giving
grandma the world tour again.

347
00:27:59,401 --> 00:28:00,376
(chuckling)

348
00:28:00,377 --> 00:28:01,389
- You should actually go find 'em, babe.

349
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,909
- [Marcus] Okay, oh, I got
that, don't worry about it.

350
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:04,693
- [Becky] Really?

351
00:28:04,743 --> 00:28:05,576
- Yeah, of course.

352
00:28:05,577 --> 00:28:07,349
Thanks for bringing breakfast, love.

353
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,350
- Always.

354
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,319
Bye Vincent.

355
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,320
- Bye, Becky.

356
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,469
- You know, my father-in-law plays poker

357
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,979
every other Saturday night,
remind me to invite you

358
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,980
to our next game.

359
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:29,620
- My sister showed up last night.

360
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:32,249
- Wait, sister?

361
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,250
- Foster.

362
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,743
- [Marcus] Why didn't you...

363
00:28:34,793 --> 00:28:35,670
- Because it didn't matter.

364
00:28:35,671 --> 00:28:37,753
She hasn't talked to me in years.

365
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,589
- What'd you do?

366
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,089
- [Vincent] Huh?

367
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,940
- What'd you do to upset her so much?

368
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,948
- No, nothing, she's just like that.

369
00:28:49,949 --> 00:28:52,299
She's not exactly the
best influence on people.

370
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,310
- Interesting.

371
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,740
Listen,

372
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,820
I talked to Dennis last night.

373
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:04,680
I think he's a little bit worried.

374
00:29:04,681 --> 00:29:06,203
- Well, he needs to relax.

375
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,100
- I get why we're doing it,

376
00:29:09,101 --> 00:29:10,950
but do you think we took on too much?

377
00:29:12,113 --> 00:29:12,970
- Do you have any other ideas

378
00:29:12,971 --> 00:29:14,770
on how to bail us out? I'm all ears.

379
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,780
- You sure you're okay?

380
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:21,243
- I told you, I'm just tired.

381
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:25,099
- All right.

382
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,100
I love you, brother.

383
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,840
Take care of yourself.

384
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:34,089
Stay away from me Edith's
coffee this morning,

385
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,623
it makes molasses look runny.

386
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,160
- Hello?

387
00:30:19,555 --> 00:30:21,055
Oh, fucking gross.

388
00:30:29,168 --> 00:30:31,418
(scoffing)

389
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,490
- You're way too stressed.

390
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,209
You need to stop holding up that guard.

391
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:27,993
- Sorry.

392
00:31:28,043 --> 00:31:29,000
- I know you're trying,

393
00:31:29,001 --> 00:31:30,599
and it's beautiful.

394
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,049
But you need to rip that mask off, okay?

395
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:38,269
If you want them to
feel what she's feeling,

396
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:41,993
if any of this to be
believed, you can't hide.

397
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,039
Okay?

398
00:31:44,089 --> 00:31:44,922
- Okay.

399
00:31:44,923 --> 00:31:46,119
- I know you can do this.

400
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,120
Okay?

401
00:31:48,312 --> 00:31:49,312
There we are.

402
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,159
All right, you got this,

403
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,669
you're 90% there, 90 fucking percent.

404
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,119
- [Woman] Sure.

405
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,209
- Rene, sorry, it's Mickey on the phone.

406
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,043
- Mickey?

407
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:00,372
- Yeah, I don't know.

408
00:32:00,373 --> 00:32:01,613
- What the hell's his problem?

409
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,689
All right, I'm gonna
take this call, y'all.

410
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:07,040
Just give me a few minutes,
I'll be right back.

411
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,250
Mickey.

412
00:32:16,156 --> 00:32:16,939
- [Woman] Hi.

413
00:32:16,989 --> 00:32:17,773
- Hi.

414
00:32:17,823 --> 00:32:18,823
- Oh my God.

415
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,770
We knew you'd be back.

416
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:25,139
- No, I'm actually not.

417
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,719
- What, no, no, no, no, no, no,

418
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,132
you cannot ditch us like this.

419
00:32:28,133 --> 00:32:30,469
- I am so sorry, is Rene here?

420
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,303
- You just missed him.

421
00:32:31,304 --> 00:32:32,329
- He's pissed.

422
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:33,459
- Do you blame him?

423
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,939
- Yeah, no, I know, I was kind of a dick.

424
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,839
But he was being a dick also,

425
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,289
so will you please just do me a favor

426
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,399
and not tell him that I'm here?

427
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,649
I just wanna grab my stuff and go.

428
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,599
- Yeah, scout's honor.
- Sure.

429
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,433
- Thank you.

430
00:32:45,434 --> 00:32:47,009
- Oh my God, so this
is all you how, right?

431
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,569
How are you, how are you feeling?

432
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:50,449
- Yeah, I'm terrified.

433
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:51,639
- Yeah, that's normal.

434
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,863
But you're gonna be fucking
awesome, it's your time, okay?

435
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,839
I believe in you.

436
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,840
Give me a hug.

437
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,759
Okay, now seriously, I
got to get my shit and go

438
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,079
before Rene comes back in here

439
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,669
and starts yelling at you guys all again

440
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,803
and telling you that
you're 95 fucking percent.

441
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,743
(sighing)

442
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,540
Hey.

443
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,230
- Hey?

444
00:33:51,492 --> 00:33:53,499
(scoffing)

445
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,500
- Hey, you?

446
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,623
- So you're actually doing this?

447
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:06,069
- I am.

448
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,420
- I can't change your mind?

449
00:34:15,942 --> 00:34:17,659
(sighing)

450
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,660
I support you.

451
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:23,543
But can I give you just a
little piece of advice though?

452
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:26,369
- Okay.

453
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:29,829
- When you leave and you
find that the world out there

454
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,529
is not all that it promises to be,

455
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:35,049
and you see everyone just
living pointless, empty lives

456
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:36,889
waiting around to die and you remember

457
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:41,023
that you want something
more, please come back.

458
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,143
- Cool, I can't do this.

459
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:51,539
- Krystal, you were made
for greatness, okay.

460
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,039
I see that in you.

461
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,399
You're smart, you're funny, you're sexy,

462
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,169
you're one of the most amazing actresses

463
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,623
I've ever come across.

464
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,099
Don't waste your potential.

465
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:08,059
Don't fucking waste the
treasure that you are

466
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,849
on people who will never truly see

467
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,563
below the surface of this moment.

468
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,500
I care about you.

469
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,913
I want greatness for you.

470
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,129
- Can you please just stop?

471
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:20,923
- Krystal, please, don't go, please.

472
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:25,629
Your beauty, your talent, your ambition,

473
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:29,703
they'll all be wasted,
you don't want that.

474
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:33,863
- Goodbye, Rene.

475
00:36:00,544 --> 00:36:03,044
(ringing in ears)

476
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:37,249
- Hey.

477
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,250
- How are you doing?

478
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,840
- Be honest.

479
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,430
How much of a dumb ass was I?

480
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,160
- I picked up some food.

481
00:36:51,547 --> 00:36:52,847
- That sounds about right.

482
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,970
It's good to see you.

483
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,780
- It's good to see you too.

484
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,110
What's this?

485
00:37:04,111 --> 00:37:07,039
- I found it buried in your laundry room.

486
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,609
The laundry room, really?

487
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,033
- You went through my stuff?

488
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,860
Creep.

489
00:37:12,861 --> 00:37:15,723
- Shut up, I was just looking for a towel.

490
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,179
When did you get so stylish anyway?

491
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,588
- Oh, the house?

492
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:24,883
It's the church's home,
no responsibility here.

493
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,599
I haven't played this in years.

494
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,883
- Yeah, obviously.

495
00:37:38,178 --> 00:37:40,807
At least we're on a equal playing field.

496
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,493
So, how's the church thing?

497
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,713
- Same issues, different faces.

498
00:37:59,532 --> 00:38:01,599
I think we're doing okay though.

499
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,000
There was actually a
situation awhile back that,

500
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,133
well, it almost tore us apart.

501
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,163
I feel like we're recovering.

502
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,663
- Are you enjoying it?

503
00:38:19,311 --> 00:38:21,627
- I'm writing a book.

504
00:38:21,628 --> 00:38:23,489
- A book?

505
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:25,337
Hell yeah, look at you.

506
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,129
- It's too good an offer.

507
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:29,383
- So what's the book?

508
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:32,850
- Are you really interested?

509
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,729
- I mean, I'm trying to find out

510
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,499
what's been going on with my brother.

511
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,131
- Why, why suddenly now?

512
00:38:43,132 --> 00:38:44,179
- Dude, don't be a dick.

513
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,180
- A dick?

514
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:47,339
(scoffing)

515
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,259
You were MIA for who knows how long,

516
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,209
and then you show up at my church drunk,

517
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,889
but I'm the dick here?

518
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,489
- You asked me to come.

519
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:55,833
- Two years ago.

520
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,819
- Well, do you want me to leave?

521
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,809
- No, no, I don't want you to leave.

522
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:06,010
I just wanna know why
you suddenly appeared.

523
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,600
- I missed you.

524
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,066
- So you're off getting
drunk and you think,

525
00:39:15,067 --> 00:39:17,936
"Hey, I miss my brother who
I haven't seen in forever

526
00:39:17,937 --> 00:39:20,699
"so I'm gonna break into
his church and pass out."

527
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,700
- It's possible.

528
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:26,979
- You're such an idiot.

529
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,163
Oh my God.

530
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,829
So how are you doing financially?

531
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:33,830
- Oh, I'm good.

532
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,289
- Good, you still working?

533
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:39,083
- Yeah, I'm in between jobs.

534
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:41,334
- Oh God, you're not back...

535
00:39:41,384 --> 00:39:42,384
- No!

536
00:39:43,176 --> 00:39:44,549
Do you want something fun to drink?

537
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,450
I haven't had a fucking thing all day.

538
00:39:47,546 --> 00:39:48,779
(sighing)

539
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,272
- There might still be
some beer in the fridge.

540
00:39:51,273 --> 00:39:54,459
- Oh, a Pastor, drinking?

541
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,913
- We live in Portland.

542
00:39:57,827 --> 00:39:59,109
I also drink coffee on occasion.

543
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,043
- Oh, coffee.

544
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:07,653
Yeah, well, I was acting, but
I quit after my last show.

545
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,439
The director was a total douche bag.

546
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,919
- What happened?

547
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,183
- Same shit, different faces.

548
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,873
And no, I didn't fuck him.

549
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:21,916
- So he fired you?

550
00:40:21,917 --> 00:40:25,233
- Dude, I said I quit,
thank you for listening.

551
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,613
Believe it or not, I offer
more than just a wet pussy.

552
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:36,289
At least a little bit.

553
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:37,340
- Well, good for you.

554
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,100
What?

555
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:44,370
- I didn't.

556
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,010
- I'm not judging you.

557
00:40:46,011 --> 00:40:48,479
- [Krystal] Oh my God,
you're so judging me.

558
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,699
Dude, you're such a bigot.

559
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,923
- I believe you!

560
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,150
Mostly.

561
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,167
- That's what I thought.

562
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,332
- It's your turn.

563
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:05,333
- Okay!

564
00:41:08,537 --> 00:41:10,954
(soft music)

565
00:43:01,586 --> 00:43:02,369
(gasping)

566
00:43:02,419 --> 00:43:03,419
- I'm glad you're here.

567
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:05,789
Perfect timing.

568
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:07,604
I'll see you later.

569
00:43:07,605 --> 00:43:09,163
- Okay.

570
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:18,509
- Morning, Pastor.

571
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:19,959
- Hi.

572
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,960
- How you doing?

573
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:24,083
- Well enough, how are you?

574
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:26,010
- Meh.

575
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,519
- Well, we wouldn't be
here if it weren't for you,

576
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,520
so, thank you.

577
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:32,610
- It's my joy.

578
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:40,900
- Hey, so, I was just wondering
if you might be interested

579
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:42,830
in grabbing dinner sometime?

580
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,309
- I've been waiting
forever for that question.

581
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:48,869
- Oh.

582
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:51,729
I know, I'm slow.

583
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:54,229
- No, no, I mean, you have
the book and everything,

584
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:55,799
it's fine.

585
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,449
But, yes, yes, I would like that.

586
00:43:58,450 --> 00:43:59,450
- Great.

587
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,733
Well, actually, how about
tonight, are you free?

588
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,319
- Yeah, yeah that sounds great.

589
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,609
- Well, just find me before you leave

590
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:11,589
and we'll figure it out.

591
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:12,833
- Okay, sounds good.

592
00:44:14,442 --> 00:44:15,442
- Great.

593
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,535
Great.

594
00:44:33,746 --> 00:44:36,413
(phone ringing)

595
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:42,743
- [Operator] Thank you for calling

596
00:44:42,744 --> 00:44:45,459
Pearl Lakes Rehabilitation Center.

597
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:48,699
Our visiting hours are
6:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.

598
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,169
Monday through Friday,

599
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:53,369
and 1:30 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. on weekends.

600
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:55,011
If you know the extension of the party.

601
00:44:55,012 --> 00:44:57,762
(phone clicking)

602
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,099
- Hello, knock?

603
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,489
- Sorry, they said you were alone.

604
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:08,029
- [Vincent] How'd you get here?

605
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:09,053
- I hitchhiked.

606
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:15,079
Oh my God, I walked the two miles, dummy.

607
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,630
- Okay, why are you here, then?

608
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,719
- I was wondering if I
could borrow your car?

609
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,009
I need something better than this shit

610
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:23,843
to wear to my audition.

611
00:45:23,844 --> 00:45:26,473
- Hey, language, please.

612
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,263
- Really?

613
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,393
Okay, sorry.

614
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,619
So, do you think I could borrow your car?

615
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:38,959
- Don't you have a car?

616
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,183
- I do, duh, but I loaned it to somebody.

617
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,299
Yes, say yes, no, yes?

618
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:47,766
- Why don't you just wait a few minutes

619
00:45:47,767 --> 00:45:49,629
and I'll go with you?

620
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:50,973
- Oh, you don't trust me.

621
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:53,390
- I didn't say that.

622
00:45:53,391 --> 00:45:54,913
- Yeah, but you suck at lying.

623
00:45:55,978 --> 00:45:56,811
(knocking on door)

624
00:45:56,812 --> 00:45:59,429
- Oh, hey, sorry, are you in a meeting?

625
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:02,999
- No, no, we were about to
head out to lunch, actually.

626
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,949
Krystal, this is Marcus,
Marcus, my sister.

627
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,699
- Krystal, the infamous sister, hi.

628
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:09,871
- Infamous?

629
00:46:09,872 --> 00:46:10,705
(chuckling)

630
00:46:10,706 --> 00:46:13,769
Gosh darn, Vincent, what have
you been saying about me?

631
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:16,339
- Oh, no, Vincent's a beautiful person.

632
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,859
Strong in his faith.

633
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:20,749
He's a good leader for our people.

634
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,484
Please, give us some dirt on him.

635
00:46:22,485 --> 00:46:23,336
- Oh.

636
00:46:23,386 --> 00:46:24,219
(chuckling)

637
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,869
I would probably go to hell
for sharing a few things

638
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:27,693
I know about your precious Pastor.

639
00:46:29,967 --> 00:46:30,750
- Oh.

640
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,680
(chuckling)

641
00:46:31,681 --> 00:46:33,249
Well, are you two going down the street?

642
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:35,550
There's this place we
just go to all the time.

643
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:38,093
- I'm actually not sure yet.

644
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,149
- Okay, well, let me know

645
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:44,623
if you want company, I'm available.

646
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,339
- Yeah, we have a couple
of other stops to make,

647
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:50,119
but I can send you a text?

648
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,713
- [Marcus] Sounds great, I'll
look forward to your text.

649
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,779
- Did you need something?

650
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,529
- Oh, yeah, I just got
off the phone with Dennis.

651
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:00,313
You know what?

652
00:47:00,363 --> 00:47:01,340
We can talk about it later.

653
00:47:01,341 --> 00:47:03,299
The two of you just need to
go enjoy some family time.

654
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,579
- I just wish he would back
off, we're gonna be fine.

655
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,069
- Don't worry about it, okay?

656
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:09,459
Go, have fun, please.

657
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,252
Will you keep this guy from stressing out,

658
00:47:11,253 --> 00:47:13,103
I don't even think he sleeps anymore.

659
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,083
- Yes, sure.

660
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,709
Nice to meet you.

661
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,539
- Good to meet you too, Krystal.

662
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:24,353
See you both soon, or, either
way, about lunch, okay.

663
00:47:27,927 --> 00:47:28,927
- What?

664
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:31,853
Okay, I was innocent as a rose.

665
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:34,459
- He's married.

666
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,359
- He's not my type.

667
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,699
- [Vincent] Yeah, right.

668
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:39,959
- He's kinda cute, though.

669
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:40,960
- You behave.

670
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,453
- See this store is where
it's at, 'cause you can find

671
00:47:48,454 --> 00:47:51,509
pretty much anything you're looking for.

672
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:53,840
- Yeah, but do you really
save any money here?

673
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:57,769
- It's not about the savings,

674
00:47:57,770 --> 00:48:00,470
it's about the gems that you
can't find anywhere else.

675
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:06,156
Speaking of gems, straight
up gems, look at these.

676
00:48:06,157 --> 00:48:06,990
- It's rock.

677
00:48:06,991 --> 00:48:08,099
- This isn't, this is rose quartz.

678
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:08,933
Do you know what this does?

679
00:48:08,934 --> 00:48:11,669
This is healing in your love life.

680
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:12,453
It really is.

681
00:48:12,503 --> 00:48:13,400
- What are you supposed to do with it?

682
00:48:13,401 --> 00:48:15,759
- You hold it, and it
gives the power to you.

683
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,219
- The power of healing energy.

684
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:20,583
- For your sexual whatevers.

685
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:35,509
- Krystal isn't it about time
you started looking for work

686
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:36,523
outside the theater?

687
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:39,729
- Acting is the only thing I'm good at.

688
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:41,249
It's how I am, dude.

689
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:43,469
- You spend all your time
pretending to be other people,

690
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:45,799
isn't that a little depressing?

691
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,369
- We are all actors,
Vincent, I just found a way

692
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:49,663
to get paid for it.

693
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:53,275
- No, we are definitely not all actors.

694
00:48:53,276 --> 00:48:55,069
(laughing)

695
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:56,233
- Are you kidding?

696
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,253
You, of all people.

697
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:05,503
How about this for your hot date?

698
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,279
- Not gonna happen.

699
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,003
- Vincent, you are so boring.

700
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:19,414
- Seriously, what did you
mean about the acting?

701
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:22,299
- I mean, you know, it's
not about pretending

702
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,679
to be someone else.

703
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,399
It's about the opportunity

704
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,499
to create these living, breathing,

705
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:31,059
three-dimensional characters
and speak their truth.

706
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:31,893
And there's something

707
00:49:31,894 --> 00:49:33,659
that's like really beautiful about that.

708
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:37,913
And every time I do it I
actually discover more of myself.

709
00:49:41,925 --> 00:49:43,059
What?

710
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,913
That too new agey for you?

711
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,349
- Can I ask you something?

712
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:52,969
- Of course.

713
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:55,149
- You're drinking, are you worried about

714
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:56,300
what it's doing to you?

715
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:00,649
- Well, what's it doing to me?

716
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:03,109
- I just mean like your
health, your finances,

717
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:03,943
that kinda stuff.

718
00:50:03,944 --> 00:50:05,633
- Oh my God, you're such a preacher.

719
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,849
- I'm not trying to offend
you, I'm trying to help you.

720
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:13,519
- Vincent, I'm not a teenager, okay?

721
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,793
Like, I got it, I got this.

722
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:25,859
I do appreciate you,
though, you're very sweet

723
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:26,860
and I love you.

724
00:50:27,631 --> 00:50:29,285
They'd be happier if you died.

725
00:50:29,286 --> 00:50:30,751
You talentless whore.

726
00:50:30,752 --> 00:50:32,466
Nobody loves you.

727
00:50:32,467 --> 00:50:33,300
Do you remember when

728
00:50:33,301 --> 00:50:35,089
we used to go to the coast all the time?

729
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:37,290
Dude, that place was like
our fucking sanctuary.

730
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:43,230
- Are you okay?

731
00:50:44,197 --> 00:50:46,076
- You're own parents don't love you.

732
00:50:46,077 --> 00:50:48,089
You're so fucking worthless.

733
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:49,179
Maybe we should go there again,

734
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:51,416
get away from all this fucking noise.

735
00:50:51,417 --> 00:50:52,497
You are stupid piece of shit.

736
00:50:52,498 --> 00:50:54,465
Everybody leaves you.

737
00:50:54,466 --> 00:50:57,383
It's so loud, it's so loud in here.

738
00:51:28,215 --> 00:51:29,923
- You know I can call this off.

739
00:51:29,924 --> 00:51:31,569
(scoffing)

740
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:33,793
- What, another reason
for you to be sick of me?

741
00:51:38,583 --> 00:51:40,609
(chuckling)

742
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:43,926
- Please, I'm begging for a reason

743
00:51:43,927 --> 00:51:46,469
not to go through with this.

744
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:47,583
- No shit.

745
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:51,699
- What does that mean?

746
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:54,743
- Nothing, just go, have fun.

747
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:59,119
- But I can stay here with you.

748
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:03,563
- No, I'm just gonna be here,
boring, sleeping, snoring,

749
00:52:06,742 --> 00:52:08,199
in your bed.

750
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,120
- Are you sure?

751
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:10,170
- Yeah.

752
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:11,973
- You need anything?

753
00:52:11,974 --> 00:52:14,203
- No, do you need anything?

754
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:16,695
- Xanax.

755
00:52:16,696 --> 00:52:18,530
(both laughing)

756
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:41,123
- Hey.

757
00:52:41,124 --> 00:52:42,267
- Hey.

758
00:52:42,268 --> 00:52:43,353
- Come on in.

759
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:45,510
- Sure, yeah.

760
00:52:50,117 --> 00:52:52,209
- I was starting to think you stood me up.

761
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:55,219
- Yeah, I'm really sorry,
there was a phone call

762
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:56,669
that went long.

763
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:57,870
- Well, you're here now.

764
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,560
- Are you ready?

765
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,583
- Actually, about that.

766
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:09,199
I know this is super not okay, but,

767
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,250
would you want to stay here for our date?

768
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,053
I mean, not stay here, stay here.

769
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:18,483
Stay here and cook something.

770
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:21,459
My babysitter canceled.

771
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:22,460
- Oh.

772
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:26,373
Yeah, sure, sounds good.

773
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:30,103
- Thank you, you look nice.

774
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:34,903
- Thank you, you look nice too.

775
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:39,483
- Thanks, do you want a glass of wine?

776
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,920
- Yes, please.

777
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,570
(cell phone vibrating)

778
00:53:55,904 --> 00:53:57,316
(sighing)

779
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:58,317
- Fuck, no.

780
00:53:59,245 --> 00:54:02,495
(cell phone vibrating)

781
00:54:12,664 --> 00:54:16,527
(cell phone vibrating)

782
00:54:16,528 --> 00:54:17,528
Oh my God.

783
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:22,979
Dude, what the fuck do you want?

784
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:25,033
I quit man, get over it.

785
00:54:27,254 --> 00:54:29,653
No, uh-uh, no, you do not know me.

786
00:54:32,432 --> 00:54:34,209
(sighing)

787
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:38,069
Fine, okay, okay you can drop them off,

788
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:39,423
but no fucking bullshit.

789
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:42,853
I will text you.

790
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,233
Whatever, bye.

791
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:48,310
Jesus Christ.

792
00:54:54,005 --> 00:54:58,609
- You're such a cliche, you
really don't know how to cook?

793
00:54:58,610 --> 00:54:59,600
- It's not that I can't,

794
00:54:59,601 --> 00:55:02,689
I just don't really have the time.

795
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:05,473
- That's bachelor code for
you can't, don't deny it.

796
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:08,119
Right?

797
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:09,120
- Maybe.

798
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,100
- Right?

799
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,343
- Right.

800
00:55:14,393 --> 00:55:15,393
- Right.

801
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:20,469
So, there's a rumor that a sister

802
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:22,003
no one knew about showed up.

803
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,349
- Really?

804
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:27,983
- Any other secrets, other siblings?

805
00:55:28,839 --> 00:55:30,239
- What do you mean?

806
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,209
- Hey, come on, it's
at least a little weird

807
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:34,523
that literally no one knew she existed.

808
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,403
- What, a pastor can't
have a private life?

809
00:55:39,508 --> 00:55:42,283
- I didn't mean to offend, I'm sorry.

810
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,893
- No, no, it's not that, it's just,

811
00:55:48,573 --> 00:55:50,783
I don't really want to talk about her.

812
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,200
- Okay.

813
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:07,739
- Why don't you tell me about yourself?

814
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:11,469
I mean, we see each
other almost every day,

815
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:15,203
but I feel like I don't
know anything about you.

816
00:56:23,606 --> 00:56:25,299
- Come on, Vincent.

817
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,800
That's disgusting.

818
00:56:28,758 --> 00:56:32,499
Okay, where the fuck are you hiding them?

819
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,503
I can smell them on you.

820
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:37,493
Okay, come to mama.

821
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:40,430
Fuck.

822
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,080
Bingo.

823
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:09,673
- It destroyed me, and I had nothing.

824
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:15,181
- I'm sorry.

825
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:21,439
- It happened, but, I'm here and,

826
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,440
I'm happy.

827
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:27,340
- I don't know how you did it.

828
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:31,050
- God.

829
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:34,290
- God.

830
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:37,680
- What is it?

831
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:43,510
- Oh no, I mean, of course,
of course we need to thank God

832
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:46,223
for everything that happens in life, but,

833
00:57:48,672 --> 00:57:51,043
don't you think you should take
some of the credit yourself?

834
00:57:51,950 --> 00:57:54,063
God can only guide us so much, you know?

835
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,743
- But that's what living by faith is.

836
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:03,183
- Just think about it for a second though.

837
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,470
How do you know if
you're doing God's will?

838
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:12,009
- Prayer, talking with Godly counsel.

839
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:13,510
- But do you ever really know?

840
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:17,699
- We have a job here on Earth,

841
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,593
we can't just sit and let it happen.

842
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:23,709
- Well yeah, I mean, I agree.

843
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:26,863
But, it's a difficult thought, right?

844
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:33,339
I mean, if God works in
such a seemingly distant way

845
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:38,340
then how do you know if
what you're doing is right

846
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:41,950
or if you're being who he wants us to be?

847
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,676
- I guess it's just one
of those things you know.

848
00:58:47,677 --> 00:58:49,363
Like when you fall in love.

849
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:55,720
- Well, I've never fallen in love.

850
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,560
- Come on.

851
00:59:01,707 --> 00:59:02,790
- Not really.

852
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:05,070
- Never?

853
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:07,540
- No.

854
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:10,427
- I don't believe that.

855
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:14,170
- It's true.

856
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:17,060
- Why not?

857
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,313
- I don't know, I mean,

858
00:59:21,314 --> 00:59:26,210
I guess maybe I just haven't
met the right person yet.

859
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:30,790
- When was the last time
you seriously dated someone?

860
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:34,910
- Before Seminary.

861
00:59:36,103 --> 00:59:37,509
- That was a long time ago, I mean,

862
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:40,149
you were a completely
different person then,

863
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:41,683
everybody changes.

864
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:44,060
- Really?

865
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:46,810
Everyone kinda looks the same to me.

866
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:52,133
- What about sanctification,
doesn't that change people?

867
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:55,960
- Perhaps.

868
00:59:59,186 --> 01:00:00,186
- What do you mean?

869
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:07,460
- Well, look at Chris, a pastor
we all loved and cherished.

870
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:09,819
Now suddenly his church is broke

871
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:12,059
because he pocketed tithes
and spent them on an affair

872
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:13,060
two states away.

873
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:16,019
I seriously doubt he was planning that

874
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:17,570
when he wrote his dissertation.

875
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,179
You can't know yourself,
so how can you ever know

876
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:24,880
someone else enough to give
yourself to them entirely?

877
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:31,863
- You are so depressing.

878
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,336
- No.

879
01:00:37,337 --> 01:00:40,425
(chuckling)

880
01:00:40,426 --> 01:00:42,276
I don't want you to misunderstand me.

881
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:46,379
I just struggle to see
how you can love someone

882
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:47,743
you can never truly know.

883
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:51,193
Yourself included.

884
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:57,179
I mean, think about it,

885
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:59,273
why are people so self-destructive?

886
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:41,449
- Hey there, how are you?

887
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:43,559
- [Krystal] No small talk.

888
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:46,423
- I know, I know that's what we agreed to.

889
01:01:50,692 --> 01:01:53,392
I'm really sorry, but, can
I please use your bathroom?

890
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,240
Come on.

891
01:02:02,604 --> 01:02:03,604
- Okay.

892
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:30,970
- Aren't you gonna say something?

893
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:34,010
- Thank you.

894
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:36,410
- You're very welcome.

895
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:39,619
Sarah says "Hi."

896
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:41,559
- Yeah, well, she has my number.

897
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:46,229
- Krystal, of all people,
you should know how it works,

898
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:47,230
there's no time.

899
01:02:50,495 --> 01:02:52,099
- How's she doing?

900
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:54,573
- Pretty good, good, well, good, I guess.

901
01:02:56,303 --> 01:02:59,109
She's a bit off at first,
you know that breathy thing

902
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:01,659
she does when she speaks?
- Oh my God.

903
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:04,649
- I have had the hardest
time breaking that down.

904
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:06,563
But, she's starting to grasp it.

905
01:03:09,470 --> 01:03:11,920
I know she would love to
see you in the audience.

906
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:17,349
Whose place is this anyway?

907
01:03:17,350 --> 01:03:18,350
- It's my brother's.

908
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:20,653
Or, my foster brother.

909
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:25,683
- It seems like he needs
to lighten up a bit.

910
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:27,563
- He's a pastor.

911
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:29,823
- There you have it.

912
01:03:29,824 --> 01:03:30,990
- [Krystal] Yep, that's it.

913
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:37,733
- So, how are you, really?

914
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:43,350
- I am so good.

915
01:03:43,351 --> 01:03:44,442
- So good.

916
01:03:44,443 --> 01:03:47,513
- Yeah, so good since I have no job.

917
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,289
- I'm happy to hear that.

918
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:56,290
You know, things haven't
been so easy with you gone.

919
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:02,193
Your voice has been missed by everyone.

920
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:06,860
By me.

921
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,759
- [Krystal] Rene, I can't.

922
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:13,343
- Krystal, you are a goddess.

923
01:04:14,330 --> 01:04:18,403
You can do anything you want, so,

924
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:23,663
so do exactly what you want.

925
01:04:32,736 --> 01:04:33,819
Is this okay?

926
01:04:57,980 --> 01:04:59,730
- [Krystal] You're gonna die alone.

927
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,180
- Mind if I ask you something?

928
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:14,540
- What?

929
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:19,703
- What do you feel about all of it,

930
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:23,633
in terms of God, life, everything?

931
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:27,810
- That's all?

932
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:43,089
You know when you go swimming
and your head goes underwater,

933
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:47,043
and everything just kinda gets so quiet,

934
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:55,327
there's nothing around
you and nobody with you?

935
01:06:01,745 --> 01:06:03,912
- For the most part, yeah.

936
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:08,270
- Well, I think that's
how I feel about it.

937
01:06:11,717 --> 01:06:13,847
- I don't think I get what you're saying.

938
01:06:20,841 --> 01:06:22,133
- I don't think I do either.

939
01:06:27,861 --> 01:06:30,361
(ringing in ears)

940
01:07:01,065 --> 01:07:03,815
(dramatic music)

941
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:08,263
(crying)

942
01:07:30,749 --> 01:07:34,653
- [Rene] You are something
incredible, live like it.

943
01:07:41,977 --> 01:07:44,727
(Krystal crying)

944
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:52,810
- Nobody cares if you live or you die.

945
01:07:58,917 --> 01:08:01,334
You are a dumb fucking whore.

946
01:08:04,728 --> 01:08:05,895
Fucking worthless.

947
01:08:15,225 --> 01:08:17,308
You are a stupid piece of shit.

948
01:08:34,425 --> 01:08:36,008
You have no family.

949
01:08:40,568 --> 01:08:42,318
You talentless whore.

950
01:08:49,402 --> 01:08:50,819
Nobody loves you.

951
01:09:00,473 --> 01:09:02,433
You psycho fucking bitch.

952
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:09,933
Everybody leaves you.

953
01:09:30,287 --> 01:09:31,120
Fucking worthless.

954
01:09:31,121 --> 01:09:32,628
I hope you die.

955
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:47,305
Ride this cock you fucking whore.

956
01:09:54,648 --> 01:09:57,065
You are only good for a fuck.

957
01:10:06,247 --> 01:10:10,327
You self-centered,
self-righteous fucking brat.

958
01:10:13,843 --> 01:10:15,629
I am not your goddamn toy!

959
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:17,293
- [Rene] We're having a great time.

960
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:22,543
I just wanna hold you.

961
01:10:22,544 --> 01:10:24,099
- [Krystal] I don't wanna be held.

962
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:24,933
- [Rene] Krystal.

963
01:10:24,934 --> 01:10:27,849
- [Krystal] Just get out,
don't even look at me.

964
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:29,200
- [Rene] Come here, please.

965
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:34,353
- [Krystal] Get the fuck out, get out!

966
01:10:43,861 --> 01:10:45,893
- [Rene] I don't understand
where this is coming from!

967
01:10:45,894 --> 01:10:47,542
- [Krystal] You don't get
where this is coming from?

968
01:10:47,543 --> 01:10:50,189
I don't wanna be fucking touched by you.

969
01:10:50,190 --> 01:10:52,439
I don't even want you to be here.

970
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:54,722
Did I ask you to come here?

971
01:10:54,723 --> 01:10:55,861
- [Rene] Why did you let me in?

972
01:10:55,862 --> 01:10:58,879
- [Krystal] I told you
not to fucking stay.

973
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:03,433
I said no fucking small talk,
I said no fucking small talk.

974
01:11:14,383 --> 01:11:15,737
Get the fuck out!

975
01:11:54,430 --> 01:11:57,013
(Rene panting)

976
01:12:17,071 --> 01:12:18,777
(Krystal crying)

977
01:12:18,778 --> 01:12:19,611
(whimpering)

978
01:12:19,612 --> 01:12:21,947
- Wait, it's me.

979
01:12:21,948 --> 01:12:25,179
- I can't do this anymore,
I don't wanna live.

980
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:26,013
- What?

981
01:12:26,014 --> 01:12:27,262
- Everything is so fucked up.

982
01:12:27,263 --> 01:12:28,263
- Hey, hey.

983
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:31,509
Come on, this isn't who you are.

984
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:32,599
- Oh my God.

985
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,029
- You don't deserve that.

986
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:36,873
- Who the fuck are you to say that to me?

987
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:39,699
- What?

988
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:43,343
- I've spent my entire life
trying to figure out who I am.

989
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:45,650
What about you?

990
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:50,229
You lie to yourself more
than anyone I have ever met.

991
01:12:50,230 --> 01:12:52,547
- Oh my God, shut up.

992
01:12:52,548 --> 01:12:55,409
- Do you want me to say it?

993
01:12:55,410 --> 01:13:00,369
Vincent, I know why you
begged me to ask you to stay.

994
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:01,582
- You know what, just stop it Krystal,

995
01:13:01,583 --> 01:13:02,500
just stop it

996
01:13:02,501 --> 01:13:04,029
right now.
- Stop hiding it.

997
01:13:04,030 --> 01:13:05,493
You're being pathetic.

998
01:13:08,690 --> 01:13:12,627
- Well, you know what, at least
I'm not out slutting around.

999
01:13:13,584 --> 01:13:17,492
- Yeah, I am out slutting around.

1000
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:18,326
- Yeah?

1001
01:13:18,327 --> 01:13:19,339
- Yeah.

1002
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:22,453
But you wanna know what's so much worse?

1003
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:26,673
Being a fucking faggot.

1004
01:13:31,654 --> 01:13:34,821
- Do you get off on this, huh, do you?

1005
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:41,549
- For once in our miserable fucking lives

1006
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:46,049
I wanna hear you say that
your life is as bad as mine.

1007
01:13:46,050 --> 01:13:48,119
For once.

1008
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:50,809
For once in your life, I am so sick

1009
01:13:50,810 --> 01:13:54,853
of this self-righteous bullshit, admit it.

1010
01:13:55,830 --> 01:13:57,743
Just fucking admit it.

1011
01:13:58,710 --> 01:14:00,160
- Well, it's not gonna happen

1012
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:02,743
because I can't.

1013
01:14:04,270 --> 01:14:05,899
Okay.

1014
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:06,900
I can't.

1015
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:10,229
Some people make choices
in their life, Krystal.

1016
01:14:10,230 --> 01:14:12,113
Some people try to be good people.

1017
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:14,683
Some people try to lead people.

1018
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,549
Some people stand up there every week

1019
01:14:17,550 --> 01:14:19,469
and they say things that
they don't even know

1020
01:14:19,470 --> 01:14:21,169
if they truly fucking believe.

1021
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:23,699
And they condemn people
that are just like them.

1022
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:26,259
But I'm trying to be a good person.

1023
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:31,260
Even though I'm not a good
person, I'm a really bad person.

1024
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:33,059
But I'm trying.

1025
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:34,449
And what are you doing?

1026
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:36,367
You're not even trying.

1027
01:14:37,872 --> 01:14:39,955
(crying)

1028
01:14:44,562 --> 01:14:46,062
- That's not true.

1029
01:14:55,572 --> 01:14:57,239
I love you, Vincent.

1030
01:14:58,692 --> 01:14:59,692
I love you.

1031
01:15:02,448 --> 01:15:04,255
I'm sorry too.
- I didn't mean that.

1032
01:15:04,256 --> 01:15:05,295
I didn't mean it.
- I'm sorry,

1033
01:15:05,296 --> 01:15:09,213
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, fucking sorry.

1034
01:16:59,888 --> 01:17:02,638
(waves crashing)

1035
01:18:26,452 --> 01:18:28,535
(crying)

1036
01:18:30,652 --> 01:18:31,902
- I'll be here.

1037
01:18:39,660 --> 01:18:41,610
- It's the same face you've always had.

1038
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,523
What are you so consumed by?

1039
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:53,820
- All of it, what we're doing here.

1040
01:18:56,961 --> 01:18:59,379
- That's a little deep for
a Friday, don't you think?

1041
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:02,559
Listen, we need to talk about this book.

1042
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,659
I honestly don't even know what
to do about Dennis anymore,

1043
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:07,539
he's just getting so
upset by the whole thing.

1044
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:08,490
- Books take time.

1045
01:19:08,491 --> 01:19:09,959
- Not like this, though,

1046
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:12,189
especially when they're
already supposedly written

1047
01:19:12,190 --> 01:19:13,989
as a sermon series.

1048
01:19:13,990 --> 01:19:15,139
- What are you suggesting?

1049
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:16,440
- Well, what are you suggesting?

1050
01:19:17,661 --> 01:19:18,661
I mean...

1051
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:30,190
- What are you doing tonight?

1052
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:35,953
- Nothing, nothing special.

1053
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:40,183
Becky's getting ready for
the New Year's Eve retreat.

1054
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:45,809
- Do you wanna come over for a
drink or something, you know.

1055
01:19:45,810 --> 01:19:48,683
Get out of Pastor mode,
relax a little bit.

1056
01:19:52,110 --> 01:19:53,683
- Yeah, I mean,

1057
01:19:55,730 --> 01:19:57,180
sounds like you could use it.

1058
01:19:59,052 --> 01:20:00,052
- I could.

1059
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:05,463
Well, you were good at it
though, the kids loved you.

1060
01:20:05,464 --> 01:20:07,509
- Do you have to have a license?

1061
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:09,607
- A license to be a youth pastor?

1062
01:20:10,531 --> 01:20:11,314
What do you mean?

1063
01:20:11,364 --> 01:20:12,197
- Like a background check.

1064
01:20:12,198 --> 01:20:15,139
- Well, yes, we do a
background check, of course.

1065
01:20:15,140 --> 01:20:16,709
You're so creepy.

1066
01:20:16,710 --> 01:20:18,351
- It's not creepy, that's
a legitimate question.

1067
01:20:18,352 --> 01:20:19,312
- She's so creepy.

1068
01:20:19,313 --> 01:20:20,659
- What's in my background
- No, no, no,

1069
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:24,369
- it's not you.
- That she's looking for?

1070
01:20:24,370 --> 01:20:25,769
- Really, what are you?

1071
01:20:25,770 --> 01:20:27,399
- Krystal, hey.
- I'm just saying.

1072
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:29,129
- I'm just asking.

1073
01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:30,582
- She's so awkward sometimes.

1074
01:20:30,583 --> 01:20:31,859
- I'm not awkward.
- No, I'm awkward, it's fine.

1075
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:34,169
- You are awkward, it
is you, but it's okay.

1076
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:35,170
- Whoa.

1077
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:36,923
- I'm just kidding.

1078
01:20:36,924 --> 01:20:40,489
I'm sorry, I'm not drinking,
so, it's a new thing.

1079
01:20:40,490 --> 01:20:41,929
It's weird.

1080
01:20:41,930 --> 01:20:43,233
- How's that going for you?

1081
01:20:43,234 --> 01:20:45,829
- Great, actually.

1082
01:20:45,830 --> 01:20:48,029
- It is, and you need to.

1083
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:50,993
- It's going really well,
it's been about 12 hours, so.

1084
01:20:52,610 --> 01:20:54,399
- I think it's really impressive.

1085
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:57,469
I think that's you know,

1086
01:20:57,470 --> 01:20:58,253
- You do?

1087
01:20:58,303 --> 01:20:59,086
- remarkable.

1088
01:20:59,136 --> 01:20:59,919
- Yeah, it is, sure.

1089
01:20:59,969 --> 01:21:00,969
- What part?

1090
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:04,579
- Krystal, you're doing...

1091
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:06,749
- The not drinking part, I guess.

1092
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:07,963
- I'm just curious.

1093
01:21:11,186 --> 01:21:13,209
What do you know about

1094
01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:14,210
me?

1095
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:22,589
- If we all have impulses,
our baser nature,

1096
01:21:22,590 --> 01:21:26,499
'cause we're all flawed from birth.

1097
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:29,530
And it's difficult to, you know...

1098
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:32,029
- We were supposed to be relaxing.

1099
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:33,499
- I know, I'm sorry, you're right.

1100
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,060
I just was curious because...

1101
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,900
Yeah, whatever, it doesn't matter.

1102
01:21:40,970 --> 01:21:43,909
- Is that one of your new little projects?

1103
01:21:43,910 --> 01:21:46,419
- Yep, not a little
project, it's just a show

1104
01:21:46,420 --> 01:21:48,570
that I'm auditioning
for, it's no big deal.

1105
01:22:01,398 --> 01:22:03,648
(exhaling)

1106
01:22:08,206 --> 01:22:10,829
Marcus, do you know he's
never seen any of my shows?

1107
01:22:10,830 --> 01:22:12,329
- How many shows have you?

1108
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:14,343
- Oh, Jesus, you mean my whole career?

1109
01:22:17,321 --> 01:22:18,328
- I mean, that is kinda surprising.

1110
01:22:18,329 --> 01:22:19,162
- Thousands.

1111
01:22:19,163 --> 01:22:21,353
- That's not just my fault Krystal.

1112
01:22:22,490 --> 01:22:24,849
- Well, this one would
not be church appropriate,

1113
01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:26,323
so you are off the hizzy.

1114
01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:29,019
- Don't worry about him
with church appropriate,

1115
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:32,464
he says things at the pulpit
that aren't church appropriate.

1116
01:22:32,465 --> 01:22:33,689
- What?

1117
01:22:33,690 --> 01:22:35,679
- You do, sometimes.

1118
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:40,680
You do occasionally stray from
the template a little bit.

1119
01:22:41,910 --> 01:22:42,693
- Hmm.

1120
01:22:42,743 --> 01:22:43,576
- There's some controversy.

1121
01:22:43,577 --> 01:22:45,763
- Oh, okay, like what, that's curious?

1122
01:22:58,172 --> 01:23:00,223
Shut the fuck up, shut
the fuck up, it's okay.

1123
01:23:04,544 --> 01:23:07,713
- It's actually great, I
think it shakes things up.

1124
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:13,127
Because people in our
congregation can be pretty square,

1125
01:23:14,708 --> 01:23:16,718
I guess, square, is that what people say?

1126
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:17,979
If you can say that anymore.

1127
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:18,763
- It's what people say.

1128
01:23:18,813 --> 01:23:19,813
- Okay.

1129
01:23:20,710 --> 01:23:21,710
- That's funny.

1130
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:26,293
Well, I don't believe you,
I think that's bullshit.

1131
01:23:27,682 --> 01:23:30,853
And I can't imagine he would
say anything like my play.

1132
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:34,103
But maybe you should.

1133
01:23:41,940 --> 01:23:42,940
I'll be back.

1134
01:23:52,830 --> 01:23:53,980
- Did I miss something?

1135
01:23:55,350 --> 01:23:56,973
- No, that's just Krystal.

1136
01:23:58,090 --> 01:23:59,159
I'll be right back, I'm sorry.

1137
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:00,229
I'll just check on her.

1138
01:24:00,230 --> 01:24:01,230
- Okay.

1139
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:17,160
- [Vincent] Hey, are you okay?

1140
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:19,143
- I feel sick.

1141
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:28,499
- [Vincent] Hey, you know
this will be worth it.

1142
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,343
- Yeah, you try it.

1143
01:24:30,344 --> 01:24:32,329
- [Vincent] No, I'm good, thanks.

1144
01:24:32,330 --> 01:24:33,330
- Fuck you.

1145
01:24:35,220 --> 01:24:36,220
- Fair enough.

1146
01:24:41,505 --> 01:24:44,969
(cell phone ringing)

1147
01:24:44,970 --> 01:24:45,970
- You can get that.

1148
01:24:48,028 --> 01:24:49,528
- I don't want to.

1149
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:57,970
- Oh my God, will you please just get it?

1150
01:24:59,321 --> 01:25:01,570
- Sorry, I'm sorry.

1151
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:07,550
- [Marcus] Is she okay?

1152
01:25:07,551 --> 01:25:09,383
- [Vincent] Yeah, yeah, she's fine.

1153
01:25:09,384 --> 01:25:10,300
- [Marcus] Should I go, or?

1154
01:25:10,301 --> 01:25:11,509
- [Vincent] No, no, hold on.

1155
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:15,173
Laurel, hey, what's going on?

1156
01:25:32,007 --> 01:25:34,335
- [Laurel] Pastor, I need your help.

1157
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:36,359
I don't know what to do.

1158
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:37,559
- Okay, what about?

1159
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:38,889
- [Laurel] It's Josh,

1160
01:25:38,890 --> 01:25:42,619
he's talking so much about dying,

1161
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:43,620
- Where is he?

1162
01:25:45,844 --> 01:25:46,700
- [Laurel] He needs someone,

1163
01:25:46,701 --> 01:25:49,040
he needs a godly man to talk to.

1164
01:25:50,090 --> 01:25:52,399
- Of course, can you put him on?

1165
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,856
- [Laurel] Can you come
talk to him, pray with him?

1166
01:25:54,857 --> 01:25:55,690
I tried

1167
01:25:55,691 --> 01:25:57,248
he won't listen to a wife.
- Laurel.

1168
01:25:58,240 --> 01:25:59,943
Laurel, go get him.

1169
01:26:03,455 --> 01:26:04,555
- [Laurel] Yeah, sure.

1170
01:26:09,830 --> 01:26:13,363
- [Vincent] Hey Josh, it's
Vincent, what's going on?

1171
01:26:14,291 --> 01:26:15,411
- [Josh] I just wanna sleep.

1172
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:20,673
- Josh, I know what you're feeling.

1173
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:23,540
I felt it too,

1174
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:29,393
God's complete silence, it hurts.

1175
01:26:30,439 --> 01:26:32,413
- [Josh] They'd all be happier without me.

1176
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:38,410
- That's not true, Josh, think
of it from their perspective.

1177
01:26:39,130 --> 01:26:42,193
You are their beauty,

1178
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:45,653
I don't know any better than anyone else.

1179
01:26:48,980 --> 01:26:52,049
Sometimes I think I'm full of shit.

1180
01:26:52,050 --> 01:26:53,944
- [Josh] I told you, I just wanna sleep.

1181
01:26:53,945 --> 01:26:54,778
Why won't anyone get that?

1182
01:26:54,779 --> 01:26:56,287
- Josh.

1183
01:26:56,288 --> 01:26:59,117
(cell phone beeping)

1184
01:26:59,118 --> 01:27:01,395
Shit.

1185
01:27:01,396 --> 01:27:02,396
Shit.

1186
01:27:06,586 --> 01:27:09,669
(cell phone ringing)

1187
01:27:10,567 --> 01:27:13,650
(cell phone beeping)

1188
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:16,440
Oh fuck.

1189
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:31,019
Hey.

1190
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:32,120
- I think I should go.

1191
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:36,909
- I'm sorry, things
just got a little crazy.

1192
01:27:36,910 --> 01:27:39,689
- It's okay, it's the
life of a pastor, right?

1193
01:27:39,690 --> 01:27:42,449
- Yeah, you sure you're okay to drive?

1194
01:27:42,450 --> 01:27:45,963
- Of course, are you
gonna be okay tonight?

1195
01:27:47,870 --> 01:27:49,139
- I hope.

1196
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:51,573
- Hey, get some sleep, all right?

1197
01:27:52,462 --> 01:27:53,295
- Yeah.

1198
01:27:53,296 --> 01:27:55,693
- Please, sleep, I love you.

1199
01:27:58,650 --> 01:28:03,320
And tell Krystal that I
hope she feels better soon.

1200
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:06,809
- I will.

1201
01:28:06,810 --> 01:28:07,978
- Goodnight.

1202
01:28:07,979 --> 01:28:08,979
- Goodnight.

1203
01:28:20,937 --> 01:28:23,354
(soft music)

1204
01:29:55,550 --> 01:29:57,799
- Your time in prison has
not taught you one thing.

1205
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:00,479
- My time has taught me plenty.

1206
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,319
When you're caged like a rabid animal

1207
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:05,799
there is only one thing to do, think.

1208
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:08,123
I entertained my mind to no end.

1209
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,899
Now, would you like to know
what it was consumed by?

1210
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:11,733
- [Scene Partner] I should think

1211
01:30:11,734 --> 01:30:13,079
the very things that sent you there.

1212
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:15,719
- That was indeed a part
of it, but not in the way

1213
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:18,069
that your tiny minds thinks.

1214
01:30:18,070 --> 01:30:19,459
The only regret I have

1215
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:22,283
is using that wonderful
gift too sparingly,

1216
01:30:23,450 --> 01:30:26,440
for, if Alexander had
not awoken when he did

1217
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:30,809
I may very well have been in
Paris at this very moment.

1218
01:30:30,810 --> 01:30:34,109
You see, my shame is not
in what my actions were,

1219
01:30:34,110 --> 01:30:39,110
instead, I find shame in
these actions I did not take.

1220
01:30:39,345 --> 01:30:40,329
(casting director clearing throat)

1221
01:30:40,330 --> 01:30:42,009
- [Casting Director] Thank you, Krystal,

1222
01:30:42,010 --> 01:30:43,623
that was very helpful.

1223
01:30:48,069 --> 01:30:50,016
- Do you want to see anything different?

1224
01:30:50,017 --> 01:30:53,137
- No, no, that's good for now, thank you.

1225
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:57,889
- Oh.

1226
01:30:57,890 --> 01:31:00,283
Okay, thank you.

1227
01:31:05,552 --> 01:31:06,972
- [Casting Director] Careful.

1228
01:31:06,973 --> 01:31:08,390
- Right, careful.

1229
01:31:16,105 --> 01:31:18,272
(sighing)

1230
01:31:22,617 --> 01:31:23,784
Fucking idiot.

1231
01:31:43,415 --> 01:31:46,436
He wouldn't let me do a good scene.

1232
01:31:46,437 --> 01:31:48,770
(muttering)

1233
01:31:50,108 --> 01:31:51,108
I shoulda.

1234
01:31:52,408 --> 01:31:54,491
Fucking only opportunity.

1235
01:31:56,240 --> 01:31:57,240
Fuck!

1236
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:02,200
Fuck.

1237
01:32:04,744 --> 01:32:05,999
(knocking on door)

1238
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Yes?

1239
01:32:08,229 --> 01:32:10,079
(knocking on door)

1240
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:11,080
Come in.

1241
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:16,209
- Hi.

1242
01:32:16,210 --> 01:32:19,010
I'm sorry, I just wanted to
check to see if you're okay?

1243
01:32:20,370 --> 01:32:21,909
- I fucked it up that badly?

1244
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:24,469
- No, not at all, I've seen so much worse

1245
01:32:24,470 --> 01:32:25,923
just is this week.

1246
01:32:25,924 --> 01:32:27,299
(chuckling)

1247
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:28,350
- That's encouraging.

1248
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:33,483
- He's an asshole, and thankfully,
it isn't just up to him.

1249
01:32:34,910 --> 01:32:36,859
- Well, what did you think?

1250
01:32:36,860 --> 01:32:39,609
- I watched you last year, talked to Rene

1251
01:32:39,610 --> 01:32:40,710
about what you can do.

1252
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:47,420
And, I might be persuaded
to give you a second chance.

1253
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:51,879
- Okay, you know what?

1254
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:54,053
This is getting incredibly fucking old.

1255
01:32:55,310 --> 01:32:56,266
- I didn't mean anything by it.

1256
01:32:56,267 --> 01:32:59,519
- Bullshit, what did Rene tell you?

1257
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:02,169
- That you're incredibly
talented but scared.

1258
01:33:02,170 --> 01:33:03,719
- Of what?

1259
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:05,349
- He says you're scared of yourself.

1260
01:33:05,350 --> 01:33:07,559
- Oh, so he didn't tell you
that I would sleep with you?

1261
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:09,709
Because that seems to be a thing.

1262
01:33:09,710 --> 01:33:10,543
Everyone seems to think

1263
01:33:10,544 --> 01:33:13,319
that I am just dying
to get their dick wet.

1264
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:15,499
- Look, I really wasn't
trying to mean anything by it.

1265
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:17,069
- Whatever.

1266
01:33:17,070 --> 01:33:18,075
You know what?

1267
01:33:18,076 --> 01:33:19,476
Everyone just wants what they want.

1268
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:24,959
Oh, hey, by the way, your
script, yeah, it fucking sucks,

1269
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:26,749
why don't you learn how to write?

1270
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:27,533
- Yeah.

1271
01:33:27,583 --> 01:33:28,583
- [Krystal] Yeah.

1272
01:33:29,530 --> 01:33:30,363
- Good luck.

1273
01:33:30,364 --> 01:33:31,444
- [Krystal] Yeah, fuck you!

1274
01:33:35,287 --> 01:33:36,287
- Fuck.

1275
01:33:43,530 --> 01:33:46,109
- We can't sustain with
this type of decline,

1276
01:33:46,110 --> 01:33:49,529
and another sermon on
finances will only do so much.

1277
01:33:49,530 --> 01:33:51,259
- [Elder] The problem is,
is they don't trust us.

1278
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:53,289
- Well, don't you think
the people still here

1279
01:33:53,290 --> 01:33:55,189
are invested enough to believe?

1280
01:33:55,190 --> 01:33:57,279
- We can expect any more from them.

1281
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:59,479
Vincent, what can we provide you

1282
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:00,993
so that you finish this thing?

1283
01:34:03,980 --> 01:34:07,453
- Gentleman, we have been
struggling for so long.

1284
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:12,613
We have tried and failed, every
time we get back on track.

1285
01:34:14,050 --> 01:34:15,079
Maybe it's time to consider

1286
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:17,030
that God isn't wanting us here anymore.

1287
01:34:18,602 --> 01:34:19,829
(scoffing)

1288
01:34:19,830 --> 01:34:21,559
- What do you mean?

1289
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:25,513
- What I said, maybe it's
time to close our doors.

1290
01:34:26,610 --> 01:34:29,463
- What about the congregation,
where do they go?

1291
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:34,739
- Wherever they want, we're
not the only church in town.

1292
01:34:34,740 --> 01:34:38,469
- Vincent, God put us
together for a reason,

1293
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:40,569
we can't just drop
everything that's not being

1294
01:34:40,570 --> 01:34:44,049
a good steward of what
he's entrusted to us.

1295
01:34:44,050 --> 01:34:46,023
- Vincent, I know you're tired, but,

1296
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:48,970
we can't just abandon everything.

1297
01:34:52,430 --> 01:34:53,430
- Okay.

1298
01:34:54,350 --> 01:34:57,443
Nevermind, it was just a passing thought.

1299
01:34:59,420 --> 01:35:02,633
- [Marcus] Okay then,
anybody have anymore ideas?

1300
01:35:08,326 --> 01:35:11,539
- [Elder] We can talk
more after Sunday's lunch.

1301
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:13,359
- What the heck was that?

1302
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:14,839
- I was just looking for alternatives.

1303
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:15,983
- Yeah, but giving up?

1304
01:35:16,978 --> 01:35:18,719
That's not like you.

1305
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:19,859
- You don't know what's like me.

1306
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:21,093
- What is going on?

1307
01:35:22,284 --> 01:35:23,729
(knocking on door)

1308
01:35:23,730 --> 01:35:24,730
- Yes?

1309
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:27,939
- Laurel's here to see you.

1310
01:35:27,940 --> 01:35:29,349
- Okay, bring her in.

1311
01:35:29,350 --> 01:35:30,713
- Vincent, she's crying.

1312
01:35:31,710 --> 01:35:32,710
- What's going on?

1313
01:35:35,030 --> 01:35:36,030
- I have no idea.

1314
01:35:40,330 --> 01:35:44,179
- Laurel, hey, please take a seat.

1315
01:35:44,180 --> 01:35:45,430
- Pastor, I need to talk.

1316
01:35:46,590 --> 01:35:47,689
- I'll step outside.

1317
01:35:47,690 --> 01:35:50,639
- Wait, what's this about?

1318
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:52,519
- Please don't do that, don't play dumb,

1319
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:53,720
he doesn't deserve that.

1320
01:35:55,830 --> 01:35:56,830
- Where is Josh?

1321
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:00,273
Laurel, where is Josh?

1322
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:03,453
- I found him in our backyard.

1323
01:36:05,182 --> 01:36:07,103
I took the baby, we went to the park.

1324
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:09,623
He said he was fine.

1325
01:36:10,916 --> 01:36:11,749
(crying)

1326
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:12,763
He hung himself.

1327
01:36:14,530 --> 01:36:15,729
- Jesus Christ.

1328
01:36:15,730 --> 01:36:17,939
- You knew he was gonna do that.

1329
01:36:17,940 --> 01:36:21,109
How could you let him,
how could you not care?

1330
01:36:21,110 --> 01:36:21,980
- I do care.

1331
01:36:22,030 --> 01:36:23,030
- Bullshit!

1332
01:36:23,930 --> 01:36:26,889
I begged for your help, I begged you!

1333
01:36:26,890 --> 01:36:28,949
I heard every word you said to him,

1334
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:30,899
you are lying piece of garbage,

1335
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:32,679
and you took my husband's life!

1336
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:34,679
- Laurel, Vincent loved Josh.

1337
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:36,169
- You didn't hear him!

1338
01:36:36,170 --> 01:36:38,453
He doesn't believe a word of it, do you?

1339
01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:41,453
Why are you even here?

1340
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:44,900
- Perhaps we should pray together.

1341
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:49,789
- No, no more prayers, not from you.

1342
01:36:49,790 --> 01:36:52,813
I can't wait for the day
you find out hell is real.

1343
01:36:57,670 --> 01:36:58,670
- Vincent!

1344
01:36:59,637 --> 01:37:02,362
(tense music)

1345
01:37:02,363 --> 01:37:04,530
(sighing)

1346
01:37:07,090 --> 01:37:08,090
- I'm leaving.

1347
01:37:09,806 --> 01:37:12,056
(scoffing)

1348
01:37:14,236 --> 01:37:16,902
(ringing in ears)

1349
01:37:16,903 --> 01:37:20,493
Dear sister, I want you to come see me.

1350
01:37:23,285 --> 01:37:27,859
I don't regret what I said,
but I do regret how I said it.

1351
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:29,709
We need each other.

1352
01:37:29,710 --> 01:37:32,929
Dear Krystal, I worry about you.

1353
01:37:32,930 --> 01:37:33,770
I'm kind of surprised

1354
01:37:33,771 --> 01:37:36,079
that I haven't heard back from you yet.

1355
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:38,489
I just need you to say
something, anything,

1356
01:37:38,490 --> 01:37:41,283
even if it's telling me to fuck off.

1357
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:43,903
I need to hear from my sister.

1358
01:37:44,970 --> 01:37:49,119
My dear Krystal, so yeah,
I've been here two months now,

1359
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:52,799
but already it's trouble, it's weird.

1360
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:56,253
People staring at me and
wanting answers from me,

1361
01:37:57,265 --> 01:38:00,943
and I'm just supposed to
make everything better.

1362
01:38:00,944 --> 01:38:03,539
It really hurts to write to you

1363
01:38:03,540 --> 01:38:05,963
and not even get a hello in response.

1364
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:09,119
How can you be so cold, huh?

1365
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:10,753
Krystal, so you win.

1366
01:38:11,952 --> 01:38:13,909
You always were more stubborn than me.

1367
01:38:13,910 --> 01:38:17,439
They look to me to give them that passion,

1368
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:18,649
and that's not possible.

1369
01:38:18,650 --> 01:38:20,601
I can barely do that for myself,

1370
01:38:20,602 --> 01:38:23,399
much less an entire congregation.

1371
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:24,889
God, I'm exhausted.

1372
01:38:24,890 --> 01:38:26,929
Even a pastor needs a confessional,

1373
01:38:26,930 --> 01:38:29,179
and I think that's what
these letters have become.

1374
01:38:29,180 --> 01:38:32,873
So you know what, Krystal, fuck you.

1375
01:38:33,945 --> 01:38:35,945
I can see how truly pathetic my life is.

1376
01:38:37,170 --> 01:38:40,009
Krystal, you know something I
always appreciated about you?

1377
01:38:40,010 --> 01:38:41,269
You could always perfectly

1378
01:38:41,270 --> 01:38:43,799
get to the heart of the
matter with a quote.

1379
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:45,889
I have no idea what I'm saying.

1380
01:38:45,890 --> 01:38:47,559
I want to help them, I really do,

1381
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:52,239
but I'm just as wretched
and hopeless as any of them.

1382
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:53,379
How do you look at your reflection

1383
01:38:53,380 --> 01:38:56,253
and not just feel really disgusted?

1384
01:38:57,820 --> 01:38:59,712
Out, damned spot.

1385
01:39:01,722 --> 01:39:04,555
(Krystal humming)

1386
01:39:08,924 --> 01:39:11,424
(ringing in ears)

1387
01:39:26,090 --> 01:39:27,272
- Hey.

1388
01:39:27,273 --> 01:39:28,106
(dramatic music)

1389
01:39:28,107 --> 01:39:30,363
So, I had a shitty day.

1390
01:39:31,450 --> 01:39:32,450
- Fuck you.

1391
01:39:33,260 --> 01:39:34,979
- Excuse me?

1392
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:37,149
- What are you doing here, huh?

1393
01:39:37,150 --> 01:39:38,589
Did you really want to reconnect with me

1394
01:39:38,590 --> 01:39:40,259
or is it just that you
fucked up every other option?

1395
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:41,519
- I wanted to see you!

1396
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,861
- It's bullshit, it's
such fucking bullshit.

1397
01:39:43,862 --> 01:39:44,695
You destroy everything,
- God, what

1398
01:39:44,696 --> 01:39:45,869
is your fucking problem?
- You always have.

1399
01:39:45,870 --> 01:39:47,519
My life was fine, I was doing just fine,

1400
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:49,699
and then you show up
and it's all messed up!

1401
01:39:49,700 --> 01:39:52,509
- Okay, have you forgotten
about those fucking letters

1402
01:39:52,510 --> 01:39:53,343
that you sent me?

1403
01:39:53,344 --> 01:39:54,609
Those whiny fucking letters

1404
01:39:54,610 --> 01:39:57,290
about how miserable your life was?

1405
01:39:57,291 --> 01:39:58,779
- Is this really working for you, huh?

1406
01:39:58,780 --> 01:40:00,329
This whole, do whatever the fuck

1407
01:40:00,330 --> 01:40:02,220
you wanna do, hedonism bullshit?

1408
01:40:02,221 --> 01:40:03,054
- [Krystal] Pretty much.

1409
01:40:03,055 --> 01:40:04,369
- Because you seem pretty
fucking miserable to me.

1410
01:40:04,370 --> 01:40:07,169
You can't even look at
yourself in the goddamn mirror.

1411
01:40:07,170 --> 01:40:09,169
- This is who I am, it's me.

1412
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:12,029
Good or bad, pretty or
ugly, it's fucking me.

1413
01:40:12,030 --> 01:40:14,109
And I'm not the one who's hiding
every little fucking thing

1414
01:40:14,110 --> 01:40:17,261
about myself, why are
you fucking doing that?

1415
01:40:17,262 --> 01:40:18,095
- You know what?

1416
01:40:18,096 --> 01:40:19,393
This isn't working, just get out.

1417
01:40:19,394 --> 01:40:20,227
- Vincent...

1418
01:40:20,228 --> 01:40:21,583
- [Vincent] Just leave me alone!

1419
01:40:23,740 --> 01:40:24,767
- Fuck you!

1420
01:40:26,948 --> 01:40:28,513
Jesus.

1421
01:40:28,514 --> 01:40:29,514
Fuck you!

1422
01:40:36,306 --> 01:40:38,389
(crying)

1423
01:40:53,855 --> 01:40:55,651
God, what is your fucking problem?

1424
01:40:55,652 --> 01:40:58,293
You lie to yourself more
than anyone I've ever met.

1425
01:40:58,294 --> 01:40:59,544
Fucking faggot.

1426
01:41:00,712 --> 01:41:01,981
I wanna hear you say that your life

1427
01:41:01,982 --> 01:41:03,800
is as bad as mine.

1428
01:41:03,801 --> 01:41:05,466
For once!

1429
01:41:05,467 --> 01:41:06,300
I'm not the one who's hiding

1430
01:41:06,301 --> 01:41:08,252
every fucking little things about myself.

1431
01:41:08,253 --> 01:41:09,253
Fuck you!

1432
01:41:13,492 --> 01:41:16,242
(dramatic music)

1433
01:42:05,930 --> 01:42:06,930
- Fuck.

1434
01:44:45,328 --> 01:44:47,593
- [Krystal] To my sweet, sweet Vincent.

1435
01:44:49,270 --> 01:44:50,270
Hey.

1436
01:44:51,460 --> 01:44:54,519
I thought maybe we should talk in person,

1437
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:58,030
but, we both know that
wouldn't go so well.

1438
01:44:59,003 --> 01:45:01,519
I mean, Jesus Christ,

1439
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:04,063
how can eyes be so judgmental?

1440
01:45:06,970 --> 01:45:09,503
Do you remember our last summer together?

1441
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:12,760
Of course you do.

1442
01:45:15,229 --> 01:45:16,553
God, I got to you so much.

1443
01:45:18,550 --> 01:45:21,509
I needed to see you, I needed a hug.

1444
01:45:21,510 --> 01:45:24,069
I knew that you were already
on this religious excursion

1445
01:45:24,070 --> 01:45:26,359
but I didn't think it'd stick.

1446
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:28,223
Nobody changes that much.

1447
01:45:29,190 --> 01:45:32,309
All I wanted was for you to
come to our last show, Vincent.

1448
01:45:32,310 --> 01:45:34,419
I needed to see you in the audience,

1449
01:45:34,420 --> 01:45:36,570
telling me that
everything's gonna be okay.

1450
01:45:45,063 --> 01:45:46,396
You fucking ass.

1451
01:45:47,450 --> 01:45:50,119
Go, live your life, I really understand.

1452
01:45:50,120 --> 01:45:51,649
But to tell me that you're leaving

1453
01:45:51,650 --> 01:45:53,783
because I'm a stumbling block for you?

1454
01:45:54,776 --> 01:45:56,669
That you needed to abandon your family

1455
01:45:56,670 --> 01:45:59,289
and go to a seminary 900 miles away

1456
01:45:59,290 --> 01:46:01,403
and devote yourself entirely to God,

1457
01:46:02,348 --> 01:46:05,713
then I will never be as important
as your invisible friend.

1458
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:09,659
Is being around me
really going to make you

1459
01:46:09,660 --> 01:46:11,613
such a horrible person?

1460
01:46:13,029 --> 01:46:17,599
I mean, come on, what were you scared of?

1461
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:21,139
I only needed us, but that
wasn't good enough for you.

1462
01:46:21,140 --> 01:46:22,793
You destroyed it, not me.

1463
01:46:23,958 --> 01:46:25,658
Now I don't need you, not anymore.

1464
01:46:26,690 --> 01:46:27,690
And never again.

1465
01:47:04,280 --> 01:47:06,780
I hope you find what you need.

1466
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:44,823
- So guide us with your Word,

1467
01:47:45,710 --> 01:47:48,679
provide us with wisdom and understanding.

1468
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:52,323
We love you Father, in the
name of your Son, amen.

1469
01:47:54,273 --> 01:47:55,106
- Amen.

1470
01:47:55,107 --> 01:47:56,189
- [Marcus] Amen.

1471
01:48:10,230 --> 01:48:12,959
- I'm just going to come out and say it,

1472
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:16,569
we're here to see if you're
still qualified for ministry,

1473
01:48:16,570 --> 01:48:18,963
or even if you want to
be in ministry anymore?

1474
01:48:20,900 --> 01:48:22,029
Marcus called us last night

1475
01:48:22,030 --> 01:48:24,269
expressing some pretty serious concerns

1476
01:48:24,270 --> 01:48:25,563
about your current state.

1477
01:48:26,570 --> 01:48:28,499
I'd be lying if I said
none of us also felt

1478
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:30,623
or saw the same thing.

1479
01:48:33,690 --> 01:48:35,699
Marcus, why don't you start by telling us

1480
01:48:35,700 --> 01:48:38,400
some of your growing concerns
for the past few months?

1481
01:49:05,149 --> 01:49:06,458
(people chatting)

1482
01:49:06,459 --> 01:49:08,876
(soft music)

1483
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:31,600
- Sorry I'm late.

1484
01:49:32,310 --> 01:49:33,143
Had to find a good excuse

1485
01:49:33,144 --> 01:49:34,960
to break away from the back and forth.

1486
01:49:47,900 --> 01:49:49,050
- Thank you for coming.

1487
01:49:52,490 --> 01:49:53,939
- How are you holding up?

1488
01:49:53,940 --> 01:49:54,940
Honestly.

1489
01:49:56,820 --> 01:49:59,223
- Honestly, I'm nervous.

1490
01:50:01,410 --> 01:50:03,310
- I'd say that's quite understandable.

1491
01:50:06,390 --> 01:50:08,419
- Have they said anything yet?

1492
01:50:08,420 --> 01:50:09,253
- No, not really,

1493
01:50:09,254 --> 01:50:12,743
it's just been the
usual exhausting banter.

1494
01:50:15,830 --> 01:50:17,579
I think everybody's still just in shock

1495
01:50:17,580 --> 01:50:18,630
from the whole thing.

1496
01:50:22,770 --> 01:50:24,120
- I feel like I'm on trial.

1497
01:50:26,714 --> 01:50:29,139
- To be perfectly honest, you are Vincent.

1498
01:50:29,140 --> 01:50:31,140
I mean, what did you think was going on?

1499
01:50:34,610 --> 01:50:36,210
- Do you think I'm disqualified?

1500
01:50:38,930 --> 01:50:43,129
- I don't know, I just don't know.

1501
01:50:43,130 --> 01:50:46,483
But I'm rooting for you,
okay I always have been.

1502
01:50:49,670 --> 01:50:51,120
- It's just all so fucked up.

1503
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:54,243
- Did you tell us everything?

1504
01:50:56,640 --> 01:50:57,640
No more secrets?

1505
01:51:00,850 --> 01:51:02,700
- I don't have a reason to hold back.

1506
01:51:05,220 --> 01:51:07,239
- Gentleman, can I
start you with something

1507
01:51:07,240 --> 01:51:08,590
other than the water today?

1508
01:51:09,670 --> 01:51:11,689
- Water's fine.

1509
01:51:11,690 --> 01:51:12,739
- [Waiter] Coffee?

1510
01:51:12,740 --> 01:51:13,523
- Please.

1511
01:51:13,573 --> 01:51:14,510
- [Waiter] Sounds great,
I'll be back shortly

1512
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:15,393
to take your order.

1513
01:51:15,394 --> 01:51:16,513
- Thank you.

1514
01:51:16,514 --> 01:51:17,514
- Thanks.

1515
01:51:19,932 --> 01:51:20,765
Well, I'll tell you what.

1516
01:51:20,766 --> 01:51:22,269
Let's just try to eat, enjoy this meal,

1517
01:51:22,270 --> 01:51:24,699
and try not to think about it.

1518
01:51:24,700 --> 01:51:25,617
Worrying just makes us feel sick,

1519
01:51:25,618 --> 01:51:28,179
and the food here is
simply too good for that.

1520
01:51:28,180 --> 01:51:29,649
I'll buy.

1521
01:51:29,650 --> 01:51:30,483
- No, I can do it.

1522
01:51:30,484 --> 01:51:31,959
- That, sir, is not up for debate.

1523
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:34,839
I'll provide the food, you
provide the wonderful company.

1524
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:36,809
It's a pretty fair trade, don't you think?

1525
01:51:36,810 --> 01:51:39,773
Breakfast, you, I think they're equal.

1526
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:46,033
Yes, a smile, thank you.

1527
01:51:47,110 --> 01:51:49,357
I haven't seen you do
that in a little bit.

1528
01:52:04,269 --> 01:52:05,519
- Good morning.

1529
01:52:06,627 --> 01:52:07,943
I made you some coffee.

1530
01:52:09,180 --> 01:52:10,180
- [Rene] Thanks.

1531
01:52:24,610 --> 01:52:25,610
- Rene,

1532
01:52:29,615 --> 01:52:30,615
I'm sorry

1533
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:33,770
about the way I left the theater.

1534
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,550
That wasn't how I wanted to go,

1535
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:44,083
but I'm absolutely ready to go.

1536
01:52:49,290 --> 01:52:50,290
You don't see me.

1537
01:52:52,820 --> 01:52:54,653
You just see what you want me to be,

1538
01:52:57,086 --> 01:52:58,486
and I'm fucking suffocating.

1539
01:53:05,330 --> 01:53:06,680
I just can't keep doing it.

1540
01:53:11,260 --> 01:53:16,083
And it's not just you,
it's literally every time.

1541
01:53:17,790 --> 01:53:19,273
You know, these directors,

1542
01:53:21,970 --> 01:53:25,173
manipulating, controlling,

1543
01:53:27,460 --> 01:53:28,560
I'm just done with it.

1544
01:53:34,704 --> 01:53:37,371
I am so unhappy, you're unhappy.

1545
01:53:38,580 --> 01:53:41,283
It's like you forgot why
you got into this business.

1546
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:46,083
You used to love plays, you
used to love reading new shows.

1547
01:53:48,580 --> 01:53:50,163
And if I don't end it now,

1548
01:53:53,233 --> 01:53:54,233
and go,

1549
01:53:57,490 --> 01:53:58,533
I may never go.

1550
01:54:05,550 --> 01:54:06,773
This isn't who I am.

1551
01:54:27,030 --> 01:54:28,030
- Okay.

1552
01:54:37,530 --> 01:54:38,530
- Okay.

1553
01:54:44,501 --> 01:54:49,501
- We had a good run.

1554
01:54:52,415 --> 01:54:53,643
- Will you do me a favor?

1555
01:54:58,131 --> 01:54:59,927
Will you take care of yourself?

1556
01:55:02,240 --> 01:55:03,240
Get some sleep.

1557
01:55:06,452 --> 01:55:07,502
Take a fucking class.

1558
01:55:22,301 --> 01:55:23,384
I'm gonna go.

1559
01:55:27,100 --> 01:55:29,600
(somber music)

1560
01:56:38,378 --> 01:56:40,961
(upbeat music)

1561
01:57:12,465 --> 01:57:15,215
(dramatic music)

1562
01:57:33,690 --> 01:57:36,273
(upbeat music)

1563
01:58:54,744 --> 01:58:55,744
Goodbye.

1564
01:59:06,007 --> 01:59:08,424
(soft music)

1565
01:59:13,025 --> 01:59:13,808
- [Vincent] Thank you.

1566
01:59:13,858 --> 01:59:14,858
- Thanks.

1567
01:59:19,410 --> 01:59:20,783
She's a poison, Vincent.

1568
01:59:24,332 --> 01:59:25,539
- How?

1569
01:59:25,540 --> 01:59:27,409
Tell me exactly how she's a poison.

1570
01:59:27,410 --> 01:59:30,039
- What has she brought
you since she arrived?

1571
01:59:30,040 --> 01:59:32,439
Questions, anxiety, anger.

1572
01:59:32,440 --> 01:59:33,579
- Shouldn't we always be questioning?

1573
01:59:33,580 --> 01:59:34,989
- [Marcus] Not like this.

1574
01:59:34,990 --> 01:59:35,990
- Not like what?

1575
01:59:37,120 --> 01:59:39,309
- You're my brother in
this war, I love you.

1576
01:59:39,310 --> 01:59:43,212
I'm trying to support you,
but, being true to yourself,

1577
01:59:43,213 --> 01:59:45,629
it's not good.

1578
01:59:45,630 --> 01:59:48,229
It's not healthy, it's not even safe.

1579
01:59:48,230 --> 01:59:50,429
You're broken, I'm broken,

1580
01:59:50,430 --> 01:59:53,519
everyone seated around
us right now is broken.

1581
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:55,609
We come from a fallen
world, and that world,

1582
01:59:55,610 --> 01:59:58,369
dying and full of sin is
trying to lure you away

1583
01:59:58,370 --> 02:00:01,693
with it's succulent
voice, don't listen to it.

1584
02:00:04,470 --> 02:00:06,889
I know there's shit you weren't saying.

1585
02:00:06,890 --> 02:00:08,669
Something dark that you
refuse to tell the Board.

1586
02:00:08,670 --> 02:00:11,399
I know that whatever's going
on, you want to embrace it,

1587
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:12,453
but do not do it.

1588
02:00:13,600 --> 02:00:15,763
You are cattle heading for the slaughter.

1589
02:00:16,860 --> 02:00:18,123
- You don't believe that.

1590
02:00:19,170 --> 02:00:20,799
How could you?

1591
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:22,199
And you know what, I am so fucking tired

1592
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:23,779
of everyone being so
dramatic all the time.

1593
02:00:23,780 --> 02:00:26,289
Yes, yes, Krystal is fucked
up, but like you said,

1594
02:00:26,290 --> 02:00:30,069
we all are, but she is not a bad person.

1595
02:00:30,070 --> 02:00:31,869
She is trying to figure out who she is,

1596
02:00:31,870 --> 02:00:33,379
and she fights like hell
to make that happen.

1597
02:00:33,380 --> 02:00:35,119
That should be a
beautiful thing, not ugly.

1598
02:00:35,120 --> 02:00:37,420
- Vincent, listen to
yourself, think about it.

1599
02:00:38,350 --> 02:00:40,769
You and I, and everyone who
has ever taking a breath

1600
02:00:40,770 --> 02:00:44,393
has a nature that was
beautiful once, yes, but,

1601
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:47,909
the fall ripped away from
who we were supposed to be

1602
02:00:47,910 --> 02:00:49,719
and turned us evil.

1603
02:00:49,720 --> 02:00:51,619
Do we really want to know
the depths of who we are

1604
02:00:51,620 --> 02:00:53,570
without a God who kindly offers rescue?

1605
02:00:55,640 --> 02:00:57,289
- Marcus, what are you so afraid of?

1606
02:00:57,290 --> 02:01:01,149
- Everything, Vincent,
I'm at war with myself

1607
02:01:01,150 --> 02:01:02,313
more than anyone else.

1608
02:01:03,660 --> 02:01:04,743
The chief of sinners.

1609
02:01:06,200 --> 02:01:09,759
There's a person in me who I despise.

1610
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:11,689
I don't do the things
I want to do, indeed,

1611
02:01:11,690 --> 02:01:13,340
I do the very things that I hate.

1612
02:01:16,850 --> 02:01:17,950
- You're full of shit.

1613
02:01:19,397 --> 02:01:20,469
(scoffing)

1614
02:01:20,470 --> 02:01:23,969
- Okay, yeah, I'm full of
shit, we're all full of shit.

1615
02:01:23,970 --> 02:01:25,919
But has it ever occurred
to you that the path

1616
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:27,933
to self-discovery will
only lead to an emptiness

1617
02:01:27,934 --> 02:01:30,249
and you buried six feet under?

1618
02:01:30,250 --> 02:01:31,359
And along the way the impact

1619
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:33,359
that you have on the lives of
others will only leave them

1620
02:01:33,360 --> 02:01:34,543
feeling empty as well.

1621
02:01:35,660 --> 02:01:39,169
Perhaps it's a good thing that
I deny what I think and feel

1622
02:01:39,170 --> 02:01:42,159
because at least I can
offer help, real or false

1623
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:44,143
to those who would otherwise not have it.

1624
02:01:46,360 --> 02:01:49,523
Josh would still be alive
had he been given that hope.

1625
02:01:51,800 --> 02:01:56,073
I love you Vincent,
but, what are you doing?

1626
02:02:03,130 --> 02:02:04,230
It's supposed to rain.

1627
02:02:05,400 --> 02:02:06,593
I'll drive you home.

1628
02:02:08,700 --> 02:02:11,443
The elders probably won't
decide anything today anyway.

1629
02:02:24,910 --> 02:02:26,443
- [Vincent] Can I ask you something?

1630
02:02:30,035 --> 02:02:31,213
- Why didn't I tell them?

1631
02:02:32,580 --> 02:02:34,309
- [Vincent] Seems like
it'd be kind of a big deal.

1632
02:02:34,310 --> 02:02:35,660
- Yeah, what even was that?

1633
02:02:39,567 --> 02:02:40,817
- It seems obvious to me.

1634
02:02:42,630 --> 02:02:45,969
- Yeah, but I mean, it
wasn't planned, was it?

1635
02:02:45,970 --> 02:02:47,243
It just sort of happened?

1636
02:02:52,530 --> 02:02:53,823
- [Vincent] Was it all that bad?

1637
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:56,160
- It's sin!

1638
02:02:59,330 --> 02:03:00,430
- Yeah, so I've heard.

1639
02:03:05,900 --> 02:03:06,900
But did you want it?

1640
02:03:10,290 --> 02:03:15,093
- What I want doesn't
matter, what does God want?

1641
02:03:20,090 --> 02:03:22,729
- Please, no more talk about God,

1642
02:03:22,730 --> 02:03:24,379
I can't take anymore talk about God.

1643
02:03:24,380 --> 02:03:26,190
- [Marcus] But, I...

1644
02:03:26,191 --> 02:03:29,260
- No, no more.

1645
02:03:38,029 --> 02:03:39,029
It's this.

1646
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:43,400
This touch.

1647
02:03:45,810 --> 02:03:48,623
This is what I know and feel is real.

1648
02:03:51,330 --> 02:03:54,469
I'm too drained questioning what God wants

1649
02:03:54,470 --> 02:03:55,773
or doesn't want for me.

1650
02:03:59,775 --> 02:04:03,047
And I want to think about
me for just once in my life.

1651
02:04:04,950 --> 02:04:07,523
I want to think about what I want.

1652
02:04:09,453 --> 02:04:11,123
And I don't want to feel guilty about it.

1653
02:04:36,693 --> 02:04:37,910
Do you want some water?

1654
02:04:37,911 --> 02:04:38,911
- Yeah.

1655
02:05:18,681 --> 02:05:19,764
Yeah, thanks.

1656
02:06:10,030 --> 02:06:12,780
(dramatic music)

1657
02:10:33,987 --> 02:10:35,670
(door closing)

1658
02:10:47,293 --> 02:10:49,376
(crying)

1659
02:11:46,600 --> 02:11:47,993
- [Marcus] The elders are ready.

1660
02:11:51,410 --> 02:11:52,801
- Marcus...

1661
02:11:52,802 --> 02:11:55,433
- No, not right now.

1662
02:11:58,800 --> 02:11:59,800
It's sin.

1663
02:12:02,368 --> 02:12:03,468
It will always be sin.

1664
02:12:18,770 --> 02:12:21,339
- We're going to make this quick Vincent.

1665
02:12:21,340 --> 02:12:22,489
None of us like this,

1666
02:12:22,490 --> 02:12:24,009
but we're really trying
to think of what's best

1667
02:12:24,010 --> 02:12:25,633
for the congregation right now.

1668
02:12:27,010 --> 02:12:30,079
The things that you're
dealing with, the doubt,

1669
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:34,583
the stress, the personal
stuff with your sister,

1670
02:12:35,470 --> 02:12:37,620
this body doesn't need
another controversy.

1671
02:12:38,810 --> 02:12:41,899
So, we decided to not let you go.

1672
02:12:41,900 --> 02:12:44,229
We're going to send you out instead.

1673
02:12:44,230 --> 02:12:47,339
There's a new plant
coming up, it's smaller.

1674
02:12:47,340 --> 02:12:49,493
It'll be just you and another pastor.

1675
02:12:51,324 --> 02:12:52,324
- Who?

1676
02:12:58,540 --> 02:13:01,290
(dramatic music)

1677
02:14:32,207 --> 02:14:33,457
I love you too.

1678
02:14:42,999 --> 02:14:45,749
(dramatic music)

1679
02:15:58,004 --> 02:16:00,421
(soft music)
