1
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:59,686
Someone once told me
we always are where we're supposed to be.

2
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,560
Now I believe it.

3
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:07,655
Life is a journey. You know where it begins,
you never know where it ends...

4
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:09,593
Or how...

5
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:12,494
It's not easy finding one's path.

6
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:14,535
Sometimes we get lost.

7
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:18,508
Sometimes we stumble and fall.

8
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:23,374
And if we are not in control
of our own destiny then what is?

9
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,619
Is it fate or Lady Luck?

10
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:30,515
Random chaos or God?

11
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:36,490
And if it is God and you were given the chance
to become the instrument of providence...

12
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,032
Would you do it?

13
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:43,534
TEXAS SIX MONTHS EARLIER

14
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,104
- Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, Ma'am.
- Yeah, can I help you?

15
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:56,414
I'm Iost and I ran out of gas
a Iittle ways down the road from you.

16
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:59,913
- I was using my cell phone to navigate...
- Oh we don't have cell phone
reception out here.

17
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,752
Yeah, no kidding. I got to a fork,
I had no idea which way to tum.

18
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:06,153
Honestly I can't even find your road
on the map. I have no idea where I am.

19
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:07,753
I don't think I'm where
I'm supposed to be though.

20
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,156
We always are
where we're supposed to be...

21
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:13,157
But you know you're right
about the gas station.

22
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,501
Ain't none up this road
that's for sure!

23
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:20,638
Oh honey, don't fee I bad,
everybody gets Iost around here.

24
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:25,702
Heck, I've been trying to get out of
this place myself for fifty years!

25
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:29,148
I wanted us to move to Florida
to be closer to my sister

26
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:33,176
but my husband, God rest his sou I,
just didn't want to hear about it.

27
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,178
On account of all of his old cars.

28
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:40,490
Just look at this! What a mess!

29
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:42,694
They're everywhere!

30
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:47,496
You know, he nevercould see an old clunker
without ending up buying it.

31
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:50,760
And when he'd come home from a business trip,
he was a salesman you know,

32
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:55,537
he'd be towing some
piece of old junk behind him.

33
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,550
I sold the property last week
and howin heaven am I supposed

34
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:10,687
to have all this junk moved out
by the end ofthe month?

35
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:15,755
Well I sure hope the Japanese people
buy them all tomorrow!

36
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:19,129
I need to get all this junk out of here!

37
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,184
Oh there you are!

38
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,551
I found the gas.

39
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,157
- Joann, are you selling all your cars?
- Oh you bet!

40
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,186
- Even this one?
- Yeah all of them.

41
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:52,631
- Would you consider selling it to me?
- You're not one ofthose
crazy car people are you?

42
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,498
- I'm a hot roadder, Joann.
- Oh for heaven sakes...

43
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,229
Look, I don't have a Iot of money

44
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:03,700
and I'm sure your buyers tomorrow
can offer you a Iot more than I can.

45
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,239
But this here, this is my dream.

46
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,707
My husband always did Iove this one,
not really sure why...

47
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,777
You should have seen it
when he brought it home.

48
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,519
It was a mess!

49
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,783
He worked on it fourteen years,

50
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,720
fixed it up Iike new.

51
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:26,165
You think he ever drove it once? No...

52
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:31,161
It's just been sitting here, gathering dust,
just Iike the rest of'em.

53
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:36,531
Well, you know I'm sure your husband
would prefer to see it stay closerto home...

54
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,145
You reached Monk.

55
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:48,213
I'm busy doing burnouts right now,
so leave a message.

56
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:53,157
Hey Monk, it's Faith. Call me as soon as
you get this message, okay, it's super urgent.

57
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,322

58
00:04:55,828 --> 00:05:01,232
Um, no I'm not coming back with a script,
but I'm coming back with inspiration.

59
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,669
I'll give you a hint:It's a car.

60
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:07,331

61
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:11,210

62
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,340

00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,644

67
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,227
Joann, thank you so much for everything.

68
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,668
Oh you're welcome honey
and I hope you enjoy it.

69
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:40,362
Hey if that pink slip shows up
while you're packing, will you mail it to me?

70
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,674
Oh sure will Honey, sure will!
And you have a safe trip back to LA!

71
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,337

72
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,682
- Bye bye!

73
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:22,474
What year is it?

74
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,210
32!

75
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,486
Wow, right on!

76
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:50,764
Rex, Rex. Checkthis out:
Filthy, this is so him!

77
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,498
This is you man, I'm buying this!

78
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:57,242
Oh shit, I forgot my purse in my roadster.
I'll be back.

79
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,804
Is this your car?

80
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,178
- Yes!
- Really? It's yours?

81
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,408
- Yes!
- I mean, not your husband's?

82
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:09,186
- I don't have one ofthose.
- Boyfriend?

83
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,822
Don't have one ofthose either.
No, this is my Deuce.

84
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,350
- Well you got a very nice roadster.
- Thankyou.

85
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,757
I Iike your steering wheel.
53 Chevy, right?

86
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,488
My dad was a hardcore
hot rodderfrom the fifties...

87
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,300
Had a sweet 34 roadster
with a Hemi engine in it...

88
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,503
When I saw that spade on
your steering wheel

89
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:29,264
reminded me of a story he to Id me
about him and his buddies, back in the days.

90
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:37,214
Come on! Can't this piece of crap
go any faster?

91
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,409
Howlong do you thinkit's gonna
take him to test drive the coup e?

92
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:44,251
- Oh the way he drives?
Probably not verylong!
- Art's not going to do it anyway, Bob...

93
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,190
- He'll do it! OKTrust me!
- We'll see.

94
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:50,224
He's gonna marry my sister. Trust...

95
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,492
Hang a right, there.

96
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,370
Damn!

97
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,513
Hey Daddy-o!

98
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:13,217
Huh! What's up Bob?
What's up guys?

99
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:17,218
- Hey is the Chief around?
- No, he went into town to pick up some parts.

100
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:21,450
- Oh yeah? So he'll be gone fora while then?
- At Ieast an hour.

101
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,387
Why?

102
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,194
Why?

103
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:28,832
Hey, can I talkto you fora second?

104
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:32,265
You see, we came to see
the Deuce of Spades and...

105
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,836
I to Id the boys that
you'd pop the hoodforus.

106
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:39,511
You know I can't do that,
I'll be in deep shit if I show you.

107
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:43,214
So, you want me to tell pop
about yourplans to marry Sandy then?

108
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:44,438
Ornot?

109
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,275
Bob! Why do you always got to be
such an asshole?

110
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,453
Whateverit takes man.

111
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:54,286
I want to gander
at what's under that hood.

112
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:01,230
OK... But make it quick.

113
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,564
- Wow!
- Give me that.

114
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,268
He's gonna kick my ass
if he finds out...

115
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,635
- No one's gonna to tell him, right boys?
- No! No way!

116
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,219
Holy shit!

117
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,522
Hot Damn! Look at that thing!
Look at the powerplant!

118
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:33,663
No wonder no one can take him!

119
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,664
- What is it?
- It's a TURBO-FIRE V8...

120
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:39,463
- It's got a 162 horsepower
right out ofthe box.
- Oh man!

121
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:44,235
- How did he fit three carbs on there?
- He built that himself. He's got to
have at Ieast 250 horsepower.

122
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,205
- Good Christ!
- Those are some strange Iooking drums...

123
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:52,214
- These are prototypes. Something he's been
working on with a buddy over at GM.
- He's working with GM?

124
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:57,446
This Iad is only a yearolderthan me
and he knows 10 times more about
hotrods than any of us...

125
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,386
Nothing is as fast as
the Deuce of Spades, man!

126
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,526
Well why do they call it
the Deuce of Spades anyway?

127
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,660
Come on! Who brought this kid?

128
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,457
There's a spade smack dab center
in the steeringwheel.

129
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:07,597
Ain't you seen it yet dummy?

130
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:08,663
No!

131
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,429
Ah, well, Iet's show it to you!
Come here.

132
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:17,238
You see, it's his trademark.
He puts it on every one of his cars.

133
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,308
You see it now?

134
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,612
My dad said that the guy was running
the first overhead valve Chevy V8 everbuilt.

135
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,251
He was running it Iong before
the fifty fives came out ...

136
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,652
- Really?
- Yeah, when I saw that spade on your car...
It made me wonder...

137
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:32,654
Could this is be
the Deuce of Spades?

138
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,520
I don't think so.
This car's from Minnesota.

139
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,391
The woman who so Id it to me
was pretty sure about it...

140
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,593
I'm sorry...

141
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,461
Well, you know, my dad,
he was quite a talker.

142
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,296
Had a Iot of stories from the old days.

143
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,472
It's hard to tell how many ofthose
were actually true.

144
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,435
- I hear you.
- It was nice meeting you.

145
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:52,544
Likewise! Thanks for sharing the story,
I enjoyed it.

146
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,247
- Have a good day. Bye bye.
- Bye bye.

147
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:59,244
DOES TRUE LOVE REALLY EXIST?

148
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:49,496
YOU WILL COME TO THE HELP
OF A STRANGER IN NEED

149
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,603
Yeah yeah there's room...

150
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:59,242
Monk said to put a remote booster
between the seat and the trunk pane I...

151
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:04,314
I've neverlooked,
but I will today how's that?

152
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:11,420
OK Rex, I'll talk to you Iater.. Bye...

153
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:07,641
Sunday, September 4th, 1955...

154
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,708
My darling Bettle.

155
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,714
I know you're really mad at me right now
but please hear me out.

156
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,321
I know what I did was wrong
and I'm sorry.

157
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,690
I should have stopped you that night,

158
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,293
told you that I love you
when I had the chance.

159
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,327
Now I fear it's too late.

160
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,626
I've lost you and it hurts.

161
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:35,506
I can't sleep, I can't eat...
I can't think straight...

162
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,309
What have you done to me?

163
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,341
Tommy keeps saying I'll get over it
but he's wrong.

164
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,448
He's been going tothe Circus
setting up races for me

165
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,518
but my heart's not into it.

166
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,344
I don't want to do this any more.

167
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:53,454
You asked me how long I needed
and I told you I didn't know.

168
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:57,253
Well I know now. I'm ready.

169
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,689
They took my license but I don't care

170
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,561
tomorrow I'm driving the Deuce
all the way to New York.

171
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,269
I'll drive day and night if I haveto.

172
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:09,563
I'm coming to you Bettie
and I'm gonna marry you.

173
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:14,335
So please forgive me
and take back my ring.

174
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:19,716
Keep it close to your heart
until I can hold you in my arms again.

175
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,517
Your Johnny.

176
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:50,579
The number you have reached
has been disconnected.

177
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,300
Oh here you are!

178
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,403
- Is that a cigarette I'm smelling?
- Yes. Why?

179
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,304
- You know what the doctors said, come on!
- Oh Doctors...

180
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,708
What do they know?
They're all floosies.

181
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:25,278
I'm 82 and I can still do bum outs!

182
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,519
Hey Monk

183
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,478
- I wanted to pick
your brains about something...
- Shoot!

184
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:35,284
Everheard of a fifties joint calledthe Circus?
I'm thinking maybe in Minnesota...

185
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,495
Minnesota? Hell no!

186
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:42,292
Piccadilly Circus was right here
in Southem California, the cradle of hot rod ding!

187
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,367
I used to go there all the time.
Set up street races.

188
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:49,368
- In Southern California?
- That's what Ijust said!
You want my hearing aid?

189
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,370
Just a couple ofblocks up the street.

190
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,302
I'm gonna go check it out...

191
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:54,737
It's all gone.

192
00:16:55,547 --> 00:17:00,484
Bulldozed over a couple years back.
They built a shopping mall on it.

193
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,311
There's no thing's Ieft Faith...

194
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,357
Nothing.

195
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,383
Dear Faith

196
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:38,380
I found this box
when I was cleaning up the barn.

197
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:41,683
The Bill of Salewas in it
along with a few other items

198
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:45,488
my husband found in the trunk
of the car when he bought it.

199
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:48,528
I hope you're enjoying the car.

200
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,096
Joann

201
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,622
When I saw that spade
on your car, made me wonder.

202
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,522
could this bethe Deuce Of Spades?

203
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:22,633
There's a spade smack dab center
in the steering wheel.

204
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:25,500
It's his trademark,
he puts it on everyone of his cars.

205
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,729
Nothing is as fast as
the Deuce of Spades man!

Is there a problem Offcer?

370
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,366
Johnny lived for speed.

371
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:58,733
Street racing, drag racing, Time Trials.
You name it, he did it.

372
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:03,341
And there was really no room
in his life for anything else.

373
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,340
Til Bettle came along...

374
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:16,515
Hey Art!

375
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:18,329
Yah!

376
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:20,458
That girl the other day,

377
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,731
Sandy's friend...

378
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,594
- Who? Peggie?
- No, not Peggie. The brunette...

379
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,395

380
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:31,308
- What's her name?

381
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:43,286
ONE MAN WOMAN.

382
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,495
- So? What did you find out?
- He's hot for you.

383
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:54,491
Really? Is that what Art said?

384
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:58,499
Heck no! But Johnny's
definitely interested.

385
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:02,729
Art started asking me questions about you
and why do youthink that is?

386
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,399
- You really think so?
- I know so.

387
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:09,477
- So, what did you tell him?
- Well, I to Id him that you're one smart girl

388
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:12,741
and that you're not like some
ofthoseeasy girls that the hotrodders go for.

389
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,510
Really? You said that?

390
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:19,379
Well, yeah, it's the truth!

391
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:21,323
Hey Art?

392
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:22,688
Yep?

393
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:27,653
That girl Bettie, what's she Iike?

394
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,458
Don't waste your time on her Johnny

395
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:32,102
that girl doesn't put out.

396
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:33,600
She's tight.

397
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,099
She's tight?

398
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,608
Yeah! Rea I tight.

399
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:39,601
Really...

400
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:45,377
Great. He's not gonna want
to go out with me now...

401
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:48,752
Well, I wouldn't be too sure if I were you...

402
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,389
Today, Art asked me where you Iive.

403
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:57,124
I'm pretty sure Johnny's gonna offer
you a ride in his Deuce!

404
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,689
Oh my God...

405
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,103
What am I going to do Sandy?

406
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:09,600
I'm afraid of speed...

407
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:13,601
Listen honey, you're gonna need
a really strong stomach

408
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:17,137
if you want to go out with Johnny Callaway...

409
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,679
AI right, I'll mention it to Art.

410
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:23,683
- So: Do you Iike the boy?
- Like him?

411
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:27,385

412
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:30,753
Look Bettie, I have to warn you

413
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:33,621
all the girls in town are chasing after Johnny...

414
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:38,396
And all he has to do is just snap his fingers
and they'll fall right into his Iap.

415
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:39,535
Do you know what I mean?

416
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:40,694

00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:33,245
Hewas always careful to stay clear
of Bettle's house and her parents

506
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:36,493
Hotrodders were considered hoodlums
in those days you see...

507
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:40,190
Oh! I'm Johnny Callaway!

508
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:47,768
Every moment together
was a moment they stole...

509
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:53,206
And every day they lookedforwardto that
little bit of time they got to spend together.

510
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:56,371
Let's go somewhere today, just you and me.

511
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,512
- I have to go to school Johnny!
- Ah!

512
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:01,809
School is always gonna be there.

513
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:04,216
I might not be, you know?

514
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:07,255
I could crash and die
and be gone in an instant!

515
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:09,252
That's a horrible thing to say!

516
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,256
Don't say things Iike that!

517
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:14,288
So you do care...

518
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:19,361
Some might say Johnny
was a bad influence on Bettle

519
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:23,297
but I think he was the best thing
that could have happened to her...

520
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:27,277
What are you doing here? Are you crazy?

521
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,275
My mother's home, she'll see us! Go!

522
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:37,287
Ear I? I think we have a problem!

523
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:50,192
Damn Hotrodders!

524
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,599
Johnny...

525
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:57,334
Johnny stop...

526
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,296
Johnny Stop!

527
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,405
I'm sorry...

528
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:14,414
I'll be more gentle.

529
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:19,047
It's just... I never...

530
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:24,283
No, it's ok, you don't need to exp Iain.

531
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:30,263
I don't want to make you do
anything you don't want to.

532
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,308
I'll wait for you...

533
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:10,459
Johnny please, you should go...

534
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:13,599
My parents will be home any second.

535
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:18,532
Ifmy mom sees you, she'll have a cow...

536
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:22,672
Oh my Godthey're here! Go!

537
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:24,678
Go!

538
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,249
Go!

539
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:45,335
Don't try to deny it young Iady,
you have a hickey on your neck!

540
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:50,333
- I forbid you to see him you hear me?
- No ma! I Iove him!

541
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:53,542
- I forbid you to see that hoodlum!
- I Iove him!

542
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:55,540
Earl, do something!

543
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:58,476
Listen to your mother, Bettie.

544
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:03,481
You will not see that boy again,
you understand me young Iady? Ever!

545
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,620
Now go to your room!

546
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:08,623
Johnny heard everything

547
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:15,561
and from that moment he knew that
Bettie's mother would never approve of him.

548
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,499
Do you believe in True Love?

549
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:22,572
I used to...

550
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:25,707
I waited for it fora Iong Iongtime.

551
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,577
Finally, one day, I stopped waiting.

552
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:31,571
It's easier that way you see?
No more disappointments.

553
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:35,684
Don't give up on True Love Faith.
It does exist.

554
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:38,621
But it's rare.And precious.

555
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:42,688
And only happens once in a Iifetime...
Ifyou're Iucky.

556
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,291
- Seems to me all that Johnny and Bettie
found was heartache.
- Well...

557
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,624
Sometimes true Love and heartache
go hand in hand.

558
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:54,459
True Iove can be a great blessing,
and a great curse.

559
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:58,266
Well if it was true Iove forthem,
why did it end?

560
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:00,298
Who says it did?

561
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:03,445
Theybroke up. Why?

562
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:13,490
When I think back, I think it probably all started
with the Passion Pit, Iate spring of 1955...

563
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:14,582
When I think back, I think it probably all started
with the Passion Pit, Iate spring of 1955...

564
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:21,319
Hey Art?

565
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:24,431
- Wasn't Johnny working on a red chevy today?
- Uh huh...

566
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:26,568
- That snake! He'd better not.
- What?

567
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:28,429
It's Johnny!

568
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:31,633
- Where?
- There!

569
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:35,339
- What's he doing here?
- What do you think he's doing here?

570
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:37,307
Who is he doing it with?

571
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:39,508
I don't know... Bettie?

572
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:44,276
Bettie? No way!
Bettie's not the Passion Pit type.

573
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:48,352
Ifthat son of a gun is cheating on her
I swear to God I will kill him...

574
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:51,593
Sandy! Get back here!

575
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,585
Johnny I Iove you...

576
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,587
Wait.

577
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:21,357
- What?
- I heard something...

578
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:26,519
It's OK...

579
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:29,362
You are a psycho Sandy!

580
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,361
He was with Bettie!

581
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,296
Didyou know that they were going
all the way?

582
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:36,304
I mean I had no idea...
She's been hiding it from me...

583
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,734
Didyou know?

584
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,342
Get in the car!

585
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:48,707
Johnny gave Bettie his ring.
They had been going steadyfortwo years now

586
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:53,720
but he never told her once that he loved her.
And he would not pop the question...

587
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:58,650
Now that she had slept with him,
Bettle started worrying that he never would.

588
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:01,290
[FAITH]-But he loved her...

589
00:50:01,698 --> 00:50:07,938
[SANDY] - Oh yes, he loved her.
But the wheels offate were already in motion.

590
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:09,371
[SANDY] - Oh yes, he loved her.
But the wheels offate were already in motion.

591
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:14,677
If you are not going to do
something about it, I will.

592
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:19,849
She's having sex with that hoodlum,
you know that, don't you?

593
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:25,481
- Well... How can you be so sure...
- I know she is! I can telljust by Iooking at her.

594
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:28,587
This has got to stop.

595
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,355
What do you want me to do?
She's not a chi Id any more, Helen.

596
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:36,656
She's not even 18!
She doesn't know what she's doing!

597
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:41,462
And I will not Iet her make a mistake
she'll regret forthe rest of herlife.

598
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:45,038
I'm sending her to College in Attica.

599
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:51,378
- Attica? Where in the hell is Attica?
- New York, Ear I, Attica's in New York.

600
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,483
That's all the way on the
other side ofthe country!

601
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:58,385
Exactly.

602
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:23,604
Johnny! Comedown here!

603
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:37,422
Could you hand me that wrench?

604
00:51:56,413 --> 00:52:03,114
AI right. Now, the engine is running kinda rough.
So what do you think we should do?

605
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:07,384
Check ignition system,
fuel Iines and carburetor.

606
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:10,683
That's good Johnny!
That's really good.

607
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:13,527
- Sir?
- Yes son.

608
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:17,392
Is it true that you are
going away tomorrow?

609
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:21,500
Yes.

610
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:23,569
But you'll be back sir, right?

611
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,707
Yes, Johnny, I'll be back.

612
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,168
Promise?

613
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:31,680
Yeah... I Promise.

614
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:37,145
Hey and when I get back,
you and I we're gonna put the 32 body on

615
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:43,186
and then one day soon,
she'll be all yours...

616
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:03,537
You take good care ofyourmother
while I'm away, you hear?

617
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:05,644
I will sir.

618
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:10,615
Rememberto start the roadster everyday.

619
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:25,227
Keep this forme,
til I get back Johnny...

620
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:28,137
OK.

621
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:51,193
Johnny! Come back!

622
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:28,661
Don't go.

623
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,233
What?

624
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:33,692
Tomorrow... Don't go.

625
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:38,205
- Johnny, I have to...
- Why do you have to go to college
all the way in New York?

626
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:41,642
Tell your parents you're not going.

627
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:44,712
It's not that simple...

628
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:49,651
You think I don't know what you want?

629
00:54:50,253 --> 00:54:51,584
I know what you want...

630
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:54,223
What are you saying?

631
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:57,159
I don't know...

632
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:02,224
Just be patient with me...

633
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:06,165
Ijust need more time...

634
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:08,804
Bettie...

635
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:43,930
- Tommy sent us.
- What's up?

636
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:45,363
He wanted to warn you.

637
00:55:45,975 --> 00:55:49,877
There's a new cat with a mean heap at Saugus.
He's Iooking for you.

638
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,340
- He's been Iaying rubberall overtown,
telling everybody he's gonna cream you.
- Oh yeah?

639
00:55:53,717 --> 00:55:55,207
He's got the fastest hotrod in Fresno.

640
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:58,153
Oh yeah. Tommy said
you got triple trouble heading your way.

641
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:02,249
He's real fast Johnny.
You'd better get your ass down there quick.

642
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,160
What's he running?

643
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:08,158
Dunno, but it sounds nasty!

644
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:11,230
He means business.

645
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:14,236
Oh, one more thing.
Watch out for John Law.

646
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:17,670
There's a black and white on White Oaks,
parked behind the hedge, waitingforyou.

647
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:20,742
- Yeah thanks.
- You got it

648
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:33,414
You're not thinking about going down
to Saugus ourlast night together are you?

649
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:40,786
Johnny please don't do this.
I have a reallybadfeeling about this...

650
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:45,391
You don't understand!

651
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:50,264
Everybody in town knows
that he's Iooking forme.

652
00:56:54,711 --> 00:56:57,373
I have to go.

653
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:01,468
Hey what's cooking? What did I miss?

654
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:05,474
This Fresno guy, man he's a turkey,
he just jumped the gun.

655
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:08,275
Thinks he's a real bad ass
but he's a rookie.

656
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:11,351
- So... What do you guys think?
- I think Johnny's gonna whip his ass!

657
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:14,484
Ehhh... I don't know guys I mean
this guy's green, but he tears ass.

658
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:18,750
- I think Johnny's could be up shit creek this time.
- Hey guys shut up, shut up! Tommy is about to flag.

659
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:37,405
- You're out.
- What do you mean I'm out?

660
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:39,509
- You're out!
- This is bullshit!

661
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:43,251
This is bullshit! You tipped him off.
I saw you move your foot asshole!

662
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:45,353
Watch your God Damn mouth
you dumb wop!

663
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,547
- Who are you calling a wop, asshole?
- Hey what's going on here?

664
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:50,351
Oh this God damn wop thinks
he can run ourdragstrip.

665
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:54,495
Hey Buddy! If Tommy said you're out, you're out!
So take your piece of shit and get it out of here?

666
00:58:55,231 --> 00:58:55,560
This ain't Raisin City!

667
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:59,564
No! I'm not going anywhere
until I get a fair chance to race this guy!

668
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:04,569
You had three chances already asshole!
Move yourcaroffmytrack now!

669
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:09,277
What, is this a set-up? Huh?

670
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:14,205
This ain't over you son of a bitch!
I'm not done with you either!

671
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:16,247
- Name your time and place asshole!
- Hey!

672
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:31,193
Look out Johnny he's got a knife!

673
00:59:34,604 --> 00:59:36,504
Son of a bitch!

674
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:39,270
Fight! Fight!

675
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:11,432
Knock it off. Knockit off!

676
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:15,274
Go back to Fresno, Ioser!

677
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:18,309
Hey meet me at Sepulveda blvd
tonight, Culver City.

678
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:20,277
We're gonna settle this
once and for all damn it!

679
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:24,580
- I'll be there!
- You'd better be there, asshole!

680
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:44,300
Ifracing this kid is so important to you

681
01:00:46,442 --> 01:00:50,640
if it's more important than us,
then go ahead, go race him!

682
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:54,211
But don't expect me to be here
when you come back.

683
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:56,643
Ifyou come back.

684
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:25,478
And so Johnny drove out to Culver City
that night to race Fresno.

685
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:29,250
Dozens of Police cars raided the place.

686
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:31,382
They arrested everybody!

687
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:34,213
Johnnywas detained overnight...

688
01:01:34,557 --> 01:01:36,582
It's 6AM Bettie, he's not coming.

689
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,321
You're gonna miss your train...

690
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:43,526
But Bettle didn't know.
She was hoping until the last minute

691
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:48,330
that he was going to show up at
the train station to stop her and make up.

692
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,404
Give this to Johnny. He'll understand.

693
01:01:54,277 --> 01:02:00,614
Tell him if he wants to work this out,
to call me Sundaynight 8 p.m. New York time.

694
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:03,284
If...

695
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:09,322
If I don't hear from him,
I'll assume it's over.

696
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:17,292
Here's the number he can reach me at.

697
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:20,295
Sweetie I to Id he would break your heart...

698
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:22,334
But you didn't Iisten...

699
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,541
Look, you're betteroffwithout him.

700
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:31,345
He wasn't good enough for you anyway.

701
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:50,256
You kids stay out oftrouble, you hear?

702
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:52,296
Yes Officer! Sure...

703
01:02:54,637 --> 01:02:56,434

704
01:02:58,307 --> 01:02:59,296
- Oh man...
- Yep...

705
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:01,543
Johnny's definitely gonna
Iose his Iicense overthis!

706
01:03:02,345 --> 01:03:04,540
- Yeah, I heard they impounded his car!
- Shit!

707
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:08,317
Hey Johnny! Where you go in'?

708
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:33,471
God damn it! Shit!

709
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:56,627
She doesn't want to see you again
for as Iong as she Iives. Get it?

710
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:42,475
Is something wrong
with the food Johnny?

711
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:48,448
You haven't touched your food.

712
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:57,559
I have a message from Bettie.

713
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:02,496
She said to give you this,
that you would understand.

714
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:07,501
Did she say anything else?

715
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:10,501
No...

716
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:15,344
I'm so sorry Johnny...

717
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:54,550
Johnny spent the next two weeks
in his shop, working night and day.

718
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:58,452
Johnny spent the next two weeks
in his shop, working night and day.

719
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:01,350
It was Iike he was using work
as a pain killer.

720
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:04,592
He always said his brains worked best
when he was wrenching...

721
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:08,297
Well, he must have been doing
a Iot of thinking.

722
01:06:55,411 --> 01:06:56,605
Hi Johnny!

723
01:07:00,716 --> 01:07:02,343
You hurt yourselfJohnny.

724
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:05,351
It's nothing.

725
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:43,452
I think you should go.

726
01:07:47,963 --> 01:07:48,657
What?

727
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:53,966
You heard me!

728
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:58,501
You should go.

729
01:08:21,797 --> 01:08:24,527
Can't wait to see the Iook on Fresno's face
when Johnny whips his ass!

730
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:28,370
I should have backed right up
in his piece of shit you know that?

731
01:08:28,637 --> 01:08:29,661
- Yeah!
- I can't stand that son of a bitch!

732
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:32,397
- So I can pick it up in a couple hours then?
- Yeah it'd be just fine.

733
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:34,666
Great.Thanks so much for doing this

734
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:36,111

01:08:48,724 --> 01:08:50,385

739
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,753
Can you believe
that asshole's still in town?

740
01:08:52,194 --> 01:08:53,684
He pulls in at Tips, blocks me off...

741
01:08:54,163 --> 01:08:57,530
Me and Art we're ready to bust out so now
we're stuck with this wop getting in our face.

742
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:58,767
He's wound tight, man!

743
01:08:59,435 --> 01:09:01,630
He's going on and on
how he's not going back to Fresno

744
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:04,398
until he has a chance
to stomp your ass.

745
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:06,508
Stomp my ass, eh?

746
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:08,606
- That's what he said.
- I set a race up for you man.

747
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:10,169

748
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:12,739

749
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:15,549
- I gotta get this done.

750
01:09:15,718 --> 01:09:17,185
I can't. I'm Ieaving tomorrow

What about the race?
You can do both Johnny!

752
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:23,556
You can do the race and then come back

753
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,627
You know Tommy you just don't get it!

- I already set up the race for you.
You can't make me Iookbad Johnny!

770
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:11,631
It's a matterofhonor.

771
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,698
What do you say?

772
01:10:20,182 --> 01:10:21,240
I'll think about it...

773
01:10:22,184 --> 01:10:23,708
OK, Johnny you think about it

Went down to Mexico and laid low
there forthe next few years

841
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:57,296
waiting forthis whole mess
to blow over.

842
01:18:57,632 --> 01:18:58,599
He was scared.

843
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:02,665
- Howfast was he going?
- Probably as fast as he could go!

844
01:19:03,338 --> 01:19:05,670
- I want you all out ofthe hallway!
- Tell us what's going on!

845
01:19:06,274 --> 01:19:08,674
God Damn it he's seizing!
Ho Id him! Doctorcheck his vita Is!

846
01:19:09,444 --> 01:19:10,604
Restrain him! Ho Id him!

847
01:19:11,713 --> 01:19:12,680
Administering one milligram Epinephrine.

848
01:19:13,448 --> 01:19:14,312
Nurse! Get the door!

849
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:15,607
Get that door!

850
01:19:17,285 --> 01:19:20,550
Bettiecame back to town
to visit her family during Spring Break.

851
01:19:21,389 --> 01:19:23,058
She was still in love with Johnny.

852
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:23,422
She was still in love with Johnny.

853
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:26,260
Are you sure you want to do this Bettie?

854
01:19:27,329 --> 01:19:28,296
Yes.

855
01:19:29,397 --> 01:19:31,524
It's gonna be real hard on you Bettie...

856
01:19:32,701 --> 01:19:34,259
I have to see him...

857
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:39,270
- But he won't know you're there...
- Hasn't there been any improvement?

858
01:19:39,574 --> 01:19:41,235
It's been six months...

859
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:42,670
I'm so sorry sweetie...

860
01:19:43,378 --> 01:19:45,403
It's time you move on with your Iife.

861
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:48,476
Sandy said you met a nice boy in college?

862
01:19:49,484 --> 01:19:53,420
Yeah, maybe... But he's not Johnny.

863
01:19:53,722 --> 01:19:55,314
Well I've got to warn you

864
01:19:55,724 --> 01:19:58,318
Johnny's not Iike you remember him...

865
01:19:59,361 --> 01:20:02,330
You'll see what I mean when you see him.

866
01:21:00,388 --> 01:21:01,548
Young Iady get off of him!

867
01:21:02,357 --> 01:21:07,260
You could seriously injure him,
he has a feeding tube in his abdomen!

868
01:21:14,302 --> 01:21:14,631
Is she OK?

869
01:21:15,604 --> 01:21:17,299
Here why don't you sit down?

870
01:21:17,539 --> 01:21:19,234
Are you injured miss?

871
01:21:19,674 --> 01:21:21,266
You have blood on your arm!

872
01:21:24,512 --> 01:21:26,571
It's not herblood...

873
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:34,581
Bettie please don't cry...

874
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:39,319
Look, I didn't want to tell you this
because I knew it would hurt you

875
01:21:39,594 --> 01:21:41,459
but I think you should know.

876
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:44,457
Johnny had already moved on.

877
01:21:46,668 --> 01:21:49,432
I saw him having sex
on the back of his roadster

878
01:21:49,671 --> 01:21:51,332
just a couple days after you Ieft.

879
01:21:51,606 --> 01:21:52,470
What?

880
01:21:52,674 --> 01:21:54,335
I swear to God Bettie...

881
01:21:54,676 --> 01:21:56,576
You should move on...

882
01:21:57,412 --> 01:21:59,437
Give that Boston boy a chance.

883
01:22:01,316 --> 01:22:03,341
Give him a chance.

884
01:22:21,303 --> 01:22:23,635
A long year in the coma.

885
01:22:24,339 --> 01:22:28,708
The Doctors wanted to pull the plug
but Jeannewouldn't let them.

886
01:22:29,477 --> 01:22:31,707
She just wouldn't give up on him.

887
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:37,440
All her savings were gone
so she had to sell the shop and her house

888
01:22:37,686 --> 01:22:39,654
just to keep Johnny alive.

889
01:22:40,689 --> 01:22:42,589
On the outside, life went on.

890
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:46,724
Anotherfast guy came along
and became the new hero.

891
01:22:47,395 --> 01:22:52,332
Everyone forgot about Johnny Callaway
and the Deuce of Spades.

892
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,268
Everyone, but Art.

893
01:22:53,268 --> 01:22:53,666
Everyone, but Art.

894
01:22:54,402 --> 01:22:57,371
I'm done with this racing shit,
it's been nothing but trouble.

895
01:22:57,539 --> 01:22:58,733
You can't hang it up Johnny! Not now!

896
01:22:59,407 --> 01:23:01,375
Yeah Johnny just do this last race...

897
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:04,572
Come on man
it's a matter of ho nor...

898
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:06,711
What do you say?

899
01:24:03,638 --> 01:24:05,663
Nurse! Nurse!

900
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:10,469
Oh my Good Lord in Heaven!

901
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:12,474
Doctor!

902
01:24:13,782 --> 01:24:16,342
Well Mrs. Callaway,
he sure surprised all of us.

903
01:24:16,785 --> 01:24:19,379
His coming out ofthe coma
is nothing short of a miracle.

904
01:24:19,587 --> 01:24:22,351
But we ran some tests on him and...

905
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:24,589
yourson has some brain damage.

906
01:24:24,759 --> 01:24:26,590
Right now he is unable to talk

907
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:28,726
and his right side is non responsive.

908
01:24:29,497 --> 01:24:32,466
Now some of it may come back
with time... But...

909
01:24:32,634 --> 01:24:34,602
It's not very Iikely.

910
01:24:36,137 --> 01:24:39,732
Three months went by
with little to no improvement.

911
01:24:41,142 --> 01:24:43,406
He was now coherent and able to talk

912
01:24:43,645 --> 01:24:47,604
and starting to understand
what had happened to him.

913
01:24:56,391 --> 01:24:57,517
How are you doing darling?

914
01:24:59,727 --> 01:25:01,627
I'm OK...

915
01:25:15,643 --> 01:25:18,111
Why don't you write to her?

916
01:25:20,715 --> 01:25:23,513
I can write it for you...

917
01:25:29,557 --> 01:25:31,388
Take a Iook at me Ma'...

918
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:37,390
Take a really good Iook at me...

919
01:25:42,537 --> 01:25:43,765
Johnnywas a strong kid

920
01:25:44,439 --> 01:25:47,101
but no matter how strong something is

921
01:25:47,442 --> 01:25:49,171
there's always a breaking point...

922
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:51,168
Johnny, you didn't eat anything...

923
01:25:52,714 --> 01:25:53,738
I'm not hungry.

924
01:25:54,516 --> 01:25:57,110
I know you're not hungry,
but you have to eat something.

925
01:25:57,519 --> 01:25:59,180
You have to get your strength back...

926
01:26:01,222 --> 01:26:03,747
Leave me alone.

927
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:05,489
Please eat this.

928
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:07,127
What do you want from me Peggie?

929
01:26:07,529 --> 01:26:08,621
Huh? What do you want from me?

930
01:26:09,197 --> 01:26:11,131
You're not her...
You're nevergonna be her!

931
01:26:11,533 --> 01:26:13,160
- Now, get out of my room!
- Why are you doing this?

932
01:26:13,601 --> 01:26:15,193
Get out ofmyroom!

933
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:16,637
Get out!

934
01:26:17,238 --> 01:26:18,705
- Why are you doing this?
- Get the hell out of my room!

935
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:22,209
- Get the hell out of my room!
- Why are you doing this?

936
01:28:11,753 --> 01:28:13,721
Goodluck to you, Johnny!

937
01:28:31,706 --> 01:28:35,198
I got to give it to him:
He had a lot of will power.

938
01:28:35,743 --> 01:28:39,201
He couldn't stand being on a wheelchair
so he got rid of it.

939
01:28:39,814 --> 01:28:43,341
Had Art toss it down a ravine
if you can imagine that!

940
01:28:44,385 --> 01:28:47,650
He was such a stubborn,
unreasonable boy.

941
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:51,715
Struggled for months
trying to walk on crutches.

942
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:54,319
Droveeverybody crazy!

943
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:58,595
But in the end, he did it.

944
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:27,227
Here.

945
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:30,221
Put it back.

946
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:32,223
Put it back!

947
01:29:33,768 --> 01:29:34,666
You know what Johnny?

948
01:29:35,303 --> 01:29:37,237
You need to stop being
so God Damn hard headed!

949
01:29:38,272 --> 01:29:40,172
I don't needyourhelp.

950
01:29:42,443 --> 01:29:44,172
I can do this myself.

951
01:29:44,278 --> 01:29:47,213
It's getting Iate... I gotta cut out.

952
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:48,406
Sandy's waiting for me...

953
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:50,340
Oh Sandy's waiting for you eh?

954
01:29:50,785 --> 01:29:52,252
Oh then betterhaul ass!

955
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:54,279
You've been at it for hours!

956
01:29:55,256 --> 01:29:57,315
Let me just help you get it done.

957
01:30:03,698 --> 01:30:04,790
Just Ieave my sticks by the car

958
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:08,733
- OK?
- Come on!
- I'll be just fine!

959
01:30:16,844 --> 01:30:19,176
You're nevergonna be able
to get up without myhelp.

960
01:30:20,715 --> 01:30:21,739
You know that, right?

961
01:30:24,285 --> 01:30:25,809
Just get out of here.

962
01:30:31,225 --> 01:30:31,816
Just get!

963
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:33,256
Fine!

964
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:51,810
Nowthat Johnny was wrenching again,
they were able to make rent.

965
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:53,471
And fora brief moment, it seemed

966
01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:57,376
that maybe he was going to be able
to bounce back from all this...

967
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:00,811
But Johnny's ordeal was far from over.

968
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:06,484
He was summoned to appear in court,
now on trial forinvoluntary man slaughter.

969
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:09,195
- Are you serious?
- Oh yeah!

970
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:11,822
Two people
were dead because of him,

971
01:31:12,266 --> 01:31:17,226
including an innocent farmer
who Ieft a wife and kids behind him.

972
01:31:17,538 --> 01:31:20,234
Oh, the authorities wanted
to make an example of Johnny.

973
01:31:20,508 --> 01:31:22,237
Theythrewthe book at him.

974
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:24,808
They gave him everything he deserved...

975
01:31:25,847 --> 01:31:27,246
And then some.

976
01:31:27,515 --> 01:31:29,176
What about Art and Tommy?

977
01:31:29,283 --> 01:31:35,813
Tommy was gone and Art was
too scared to step forward and confess.

978
01:31:37,225 --> 01:31:38,817
So he Iied

979
01:31:39,861 --> 01:31:41,488
and Johnnytookthe fall.

980
01:31:42,263 --> 01:31:46,165
The Court hereby sentences the Defendant
Johnny Michael Callaway

981
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:49,265
to three years in the State Penitentiary.

982
01:31:50,304 --> 01:31:53,831
We all thought they would go easy on Johnny
because he was crippled.

983
01:31:54,542 --> 01:31:56,271
But we were wrong...

984
01:31:57,411 --> 01:32:01,245
When Art heard the verdict,
he could not handle the guilt.

985
01:32:01,849 --> 01:32:03,248
Art?

986
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:10,486
It's me, Sandy...
It's me baby, come on, open the door...

987
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:16,554
Don't do that to yourselfArt,
it wasn't yourfault!

988
01:32:19,433 --> 01:32:21,298
Yes it was!

989
01:32:25,873 --> 01:32:30,207
Please just open the door?
We're all worried sick about you ...

990
01:32:34,315 --> 01:32:36,215
This is all myfault...

991
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:39,452
I'm so sorry baby...

992
01:32:40,321 --> 01:32:42,516
He was my best friend...

993
01:32:48,462 --> 01:32:50,191
My best friend...

994
01:32:50,531 --> 01:32:51,828
And I betrayed him.

995
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:56,234
But baby, you can't tum
your back on him now, OK?

996
01:32:56,604 --> 01:32:59,198
You have got to go visit him!

997
01:33:01,475 --> 01:33:03,841
I'll never be able to face him...

998
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:09,441
I'll never be able to tell him
how sorry I am...

999
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:15,589
Johnny was a great frlendto all of us

1000
01:33:16,324 --> 01:33:21,284
but in the end, we all turned
our backs on him in his time of need.

1001
01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:25,494
And so when he came out of jail
in the spring of 1959

1002
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:29,201
he left everything behind.

1003
01:33:30,237 --> 01:33:35,436
Johnny walked away and
none of us ever saw him again.

1004
01:34:06,674 --> 01:34:07,504
What about Bettie?

1005
01:34:08,409 --> 01:34:12,573
Bettie married that nice boy from Boston
and became a novelist.

1006
01:34:13,447 --> 01:34:16,280
Look up her book
"Deuce of Hearts".

1007
01:34:17,351 --> 01:34:20,286
She wrote it in the Seventies,
afterherdivorce...

1008
01:34:20,554 --> 01:34:23,182
She changed the names
and some ofthe details

1009
01:34:23,557 --> 01:34:26,526
but basically it was
herstorywith Johnny...

1010
01:34:27,561 --> 01:34:29,654
She was still in Iove with him.

1011
01:34:31,265 --> 01:34:33,529
Did you ever try
to get in touch with her?

1012
01:34:34,568 --> 01:34:37,594
My dearchild,
afterall these years

1013
01:34:38,372 --> 01:34:41,239
I would not know what to say
or where to begin...

1014
01:34:44,578 --> 01:34:49,641
Sandy, do you think Johnny
is still alive

1015
01:34:51,252 --> 01:34:52,651
out there, somewhere?

1016
01:34:53,554 --> 01:34:56,250
I don't know...

1017
01:34:58,259 --> 01:35:01,592
I am afraid no one can
answer that question.

1018
01:35:07,301 --> 01:35:09,531
There was a rumorin the Iate sixties...

1019
01:35:10,304 --> 01:35:12,465
But it was just a rum or.

1020
01:35:14,341 --> 01:35:17,242
There was this well known movie actor

1021
01:35:17,478 --> 01:35:20,538
who bought a fast car from a customizer

1022
01:35:22,283 --> 01:35:25,446
and guess what was painted on the firewall?

1023
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:28,484
Aspade?

1024
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:33,592
Yeah.

1025
01:35:50,044 --> 01:35:52,672
There's a Iady here
to talk to you about Johnny.

1026
01:35:53,714 --> 01:35:56,615
Yes, Johnny did a carforme.

1027
01:35:56,784 --> 01:36:00,652
I don't know where he is though,
I haven't seen him since.

1028
01:36:01,255 --> 01:36:04,019
Didn't Johnny do a carforwhat's her name?

1029
01:36:04,658 --> 01:36:08,025
No, no... Johnny turned
that job down, remember?

1030
01:36:08,696 --> 01:36:11,597
Johnny didn't want to do the car,
because of me and my big mouth.

1031
01:36:11,799 --> 01:36:14,632
I happened to mention that
the ownerwantedto street race it.

1032
01:36:15,169 --> 01:36:16,067
That was it.

1033
01:36:16,237 --> 01:36:17,670
Johnny wanted nothing to do with it.

1034
01:36:18,172 --> 01:36:19,196
He wouldn't budge on that either!

1035
01:36:19,673 --> 01:36:22,198
He was a v er
y stubborn man.
Diffcult to deal with.

1036
01:36:22,676 --> 01:36:27,136
- Yeah.. That's what I hear...
- I ended up traileringthat car
all the way up there and backfornothing.

1037
01:36:28,182 --> 01:36:30,082
It was a good three hour
drive one way!

1038
01:36:31,118 --> 01:36:32,813
Do you happen to remember
where the shop was Iocated?

1039
01:36:33,654 --> 01:36:35,087
No, not exactly...

1040
01:36:35,656 --> 01:36:39,217
I was onlythere that one time
and that was over 15 years ago.

1041
01:36:41,128 --> 01:36:44,825
But do I remember it was in the desert,
next to a dry Iake

1042
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:48,101
and that Johnny guy,
he had over a hundred old cars

1043
01:36:48,269 --> 01:36:49,827
sitting in the back on his property!

1044
01:36:50,204 --> 01:36:51,694
That was a pretty awesome sight to see!

1045
01:36:52,139 --> 01:36:57,543
I think Johnny knew Winfield so
why don't you check with Winfield

1046
01:36:58,145 --> 01:36:59,203
- maybe he knows...
- Yeah, he's right!

1047
01:36:59,647 --> 01:37:01,080
Winfield might be able to help you.

1048
01:37:01,248 --> 01:37:03,216
He's been racing on the Iakes
since the Forties.

1049
01:37:03,684 --> 01:37:06,812
If you go to the SC TA Meet tomorrow,
you'll probably catch him there.

1050
01:37:07,788 --> 01:37:09,756
He's still racing.

1051
01:37:30,678 --> 01:37:33,670
Damn it!
I don't have time forthis shit!

1052
01:37:41,655 --> 01:37:43,646
Yep... Fuel pump!

1053
01:37:45,693 --> 01:37:47,593
Great...

1054
01:38:01,709 --> 01:38:03,904
Out on the rook le line folks
you haveto stay under 150 mph

1055
01:38:04,645 --> 01:38:08,809
and if you're driving a roadster,
you have to stay under 150 mph and spin...

1056
01:38:35,643 --> 01:38:36,905
Ok I'm gonna call this
a good record.

1057
01:38:37,711 --> 01:38:39,178
You guys are all set to go,
congratulations.

1058
01:38:39,813 --> 01:38:41,906
Excuse me! I'm IookingforGene Winfield...

1059
01:38:42,716 --> 01:38:45,651
You'll find him in his pits,
a blue roadster, a couple of bellytanks.

1060
01:38:45,886 --> 01:38:46,910
Thankyou!

1061
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:05,803
Excuse me.

1062
01:39:06,707 --> 01:39:07,969
Hi there.Are you Gene Winfield?

1063
01:39:09,009 --> 01:39:11,807
Yes I am... Is this?

1064
01:39:12,012 --> 01:39:12,979
I'll be damned...

1065
01:39:13,847 --> 01:39:17,977
Ijust can't believe it! The Iast time
I saw this car was July of55!

1066
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:20,687
Howthe hell did you end up
with Callaway's car?

1067
01:39:21,822 --> 01:39:23,687
It's a Iong story...
Didyou know Johnny?

1068
01:39:23,891 --> 01:39:25,688
Yes, everybody knew Johnny.

1069
01:39:26,293 --> 01:39:28,784
Do you happen to know where he is?
Ifhe's still alive?

1070
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:33,632
No... Nobody's seen Johnny
since he crashed in 55.

1071
01:39:35,836 --> 01:39:38,862
I was to Id he Iives on a drylake...
Somewhere around here...

1072
01:39:39,306 --> 01:39:40,830
- I was thinking maybe here, at EI Mirage?
- No...

1073
01:39:41,275 --> 01:39:44,802
I've been here for25 years and if Johnny
was around here, I would know it.

1074
01:39:45,279 --> 01:39:46,803
Well how many other dry Iakes
are there around here?

1075
01:39:47,648 --> 01:39:48,979
Oh many many!
This is a big desert!

1076
01:39:49,717 --> 01:39:51,651
He's got Iike a hundred jalopies
sitting in his backyard.

1077
01:39:51,952 --> 01:39:55,615
- You'dthink somebody
would know about it.
- Well...

1078
01:39:57,291 --> 01:39:58,986
I have to find him.

1079
01:40:01,295 --> 01:40:05,629
OK.There's a hangar overthere,
the guy's name is Pete.

1080
01:40:05,899 --> 01:40:07,628
He flies all around this area

1081
01:40:08,302 --> 01:40:12,671
and if anyone can see a hundred jalopies in
a back yard, he would see it from up there.

1082
01:40:12,873 --> 01:40:15,706
You go see Pete and tell him I sent you,
he owes me.

1083
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:20,271
Thankyou.

1084
01:40:20,781 --> 01:40:21,679

Why didn't you tell me?

1107
01:44:32,199 --> 01:44:34,690
HARPER LAKE- JALOPIES

1108
01:47:12,859 --> 01:47:14,417
Anybody home?

1109
01:47:28,875 --> 01:47:29,466
Hello?

1110
01:47:33,079 --> 01:47:33,738
Hello?

1111
01:47:35,515 --> 01:47:36,812
Anybody home?

1112
01:47:58,004 --> 01:47:58,834
Hello?

1113
01:49:08,842 --> 01:49:11,572
I have decided to write
so maybe I won't lose my sanity.

1114
01:49:12,145 --> 01:49:13,840
What's left of it.

1115
01:49:15,081 --> 01:49:17,948
If hell exists it's here and I'm in it.

1116
01:49:18,618 --> 01:49:22,918
Theywould not let me keep my crutches so
I'm back to being bedridden pretty much.

1117
01:49:23,189 --> 01:49:25,919
I'm in isolation
somewhere on the third floor

1118
01:49:26,192 --> 01:49:27,591
in Block D.

1119
01:49:28,962 --> 01:49:31,157
August 20th, 1957.

1120
01:49:32,065 --> 01:49:34,033
An inmate was stabbed to death yesterday.

1121
01:49:34,568 --> 01:49:36,934
They found him in a 10 foot pool of blood.

1122
01:49:37,203 --> 01:49:41,037
If I am to survive in here
that damn leg of mine better heal fast.

1123
01:49:42,075 --> 01:49:44,043
I don't care what the doctors said.

1124
01:49:44,611 --> 01:49:46,101
I swear when I come out of here

1125
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:48,040
I'll be walking.

1126
01:49:48,214 --> 01:49:50,182
August 25th, 1957.

1127
01:49:50,951 --> 01:49:52,543
I know I died that night.

1128
01:49:53,086 --> 01:49:54,917
I remember hovering above the tree...

1129
01:49:55,155 --> 01:49:57,055
I keep thinking about that kid.

1130
01:49:57,958 --> 01:49:59,550
He's been haunting me in my dreams...

1131
01:50:00,226 --> 01:50:03,059
I never saw the tractor
his roadster was in the way.

1132
01:50:03,597 --> 01:50:06,031
Why didn't we give up and slow down
whenwecame to the end?

1133
01:50:07,067 --> 01:50:07,931
Why couldn't we?

1134
01:50:08,134 --> 01:50:10,898
I got to watch out for Yates.
He's been looking for a reason toget me.

1135
01:50:11,137 --> 01:50:13,605
He's a mean son of a gun
and from what I hear

1136
01:50:14,007 --> 01:50:17,033
there isn't an inmate in here who hasn't
been tore-up by his club at least once.

1137
01:50:17,210 --> 01:50:19,542
I have yet to have anyone come visit me.

1138
01:50:19,980 --> 01:50:22,949
Every Sunday, I hope...

1139
01:50:23,950 --> 01:50:25,542
But no one.

1140
01:50:25,685 --> 01:50:28,620
October 10th - The horrible seizures
and headaches are back.

1141
01:50:29,089 --> 01:50:33,617
Sometimes, I just want to slam my head
against the walls just to make them stop.

1142
01:50:34,160 --> 01:50:35,923
Thedrugs they're giving me
aren't working.

1143
01:50:36,963 --> 01:50:38,624
I feel and look like shit.

1144
01:50:38,999 --> 01:50:41,559
November 27th 1957.

1145
01:50:42,168 --> 01:50:43,635
I'm worried about my mother.

1146
01:50:44,037 --> 01:50:45,197
How will she manage without my help?

1147
01:50:46,106 --> 01:50:47,596
How will she be able to pay the hospital?

1148
01:50:48,074 --> 01:50:50,167
Another year and a half ofthis.

1149
01:50:51,678 --> 01:50:52,940
I don't know if I have it in me.

1150
01:50:53,613 --> 01:50:57,606
I think about Art,
hewas like a brother to me.

1151
01:50:58,018 --> 01:51:00,612
I would have laid down
my life for him.

1152
01:51:01,154 --> 01:51:03,554
And I watched him
standing thereat my trial

1153
01:51:03,957 --> 01:51:04,924
lying tothem...

1154
01:51:05,158 --> 01:51:07,592
I should have hit the brakes
when I crossed the finish line.

1155
01:51:08,094 --> 01:51:09,061
Why didn't I?

1156
01:51:09,996 --> 01:51:11,054
Dear Johnny

1157
01:51:11,965 --> 01:51:13,626
I finally heard from Bettie.

1158
01:51:14,234 --> 01:51:17,067
She called me yesterday
and we talked fora Iong time.

1159
01:51:18,605 --> 01:51:23,565
I am sorry to tell you this but she got...

1160
01:51:24,678 --> 01:51:27,647
...married Iast month.

1161
01:51:29,749 --> 01:51:32,616
Ijust thought you should know.

1162
01:51:36,156 --> 01:51:39,125
Two people are dead because of me.

1163
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:43,061
I haveto live with that guilt
forthe rest of my life.

1164
01:51:43,663 --> 01:51:46,632
Lordforgive me for what I've done.
Have mercy on my soul.

1165
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:49,193
I saw how the farmer's family looked at me

1166
01:51:49,669 --> 01:51:50,727
how they hated me.

1167
01:51:52,005 --> 01:51:53,563
Andthe face of his kids

1168
01:51:54,607 --> 01:51:55,631
I'll never forget their faces.

1169
01:51:56,109 --> 01:51:57,576
I still love her.

1170
01:51:58,244 --> 01:51:59,074
Why?

1171
01:51:59,679 --> 01:52:01,146
Why can't I just stop?

1172
01:52:06,019 --> 01:52:08,146
Callaway! You have a Ietter.

1173
01:52:35,215 --> 01:52:36,375
Callawayknockit off!

1174
01:52:39,552 --> 01:52:41,179
I said knock it off!

1175
01:53:23,296 --> 01:53:27,289
January 13th, 1959

1176
01:53:28,701 --> 01:53:30,168
My mother d led.

1177
01:53:31,271 --> 01:53:33,102
I can't even describe the pain

1178
01:53:33,706 --> 01:53:35,640
or put it into words...

1179
01:53:36,276 --> 01:53:38,642
Theangerthat consumes me

1180
01:53:39,179 --> 01:53:40,806
I couldn't keep it in any longer.

1181
01:53:42,715 --> 01:53:44,706
They beat me really hard.

1182
01:53:45,251 --> 01:53:47,719
Maybe I deserve it
for what I've done to her.

1183
01:54:05,738 --> 01:54:07,729
The hole was cold and dark.

1184
01:54:08,775 --> 01:54:11,107
Part of me d led in there.

1185
01:54:11,878 --> 01:54:14,642
Mywhole life feels like
a bottomless hole right now

1186
01:54:15,915 --> 01:54:19,681
and I keep falling
deeper and deeper in it.

1187
01:54:20,687 --> 01:54:24,145
I don't think I'll ever be able
to come out ofthis.

1188
01:55:03,897 --> 01:55:05,888
