<i>* I feel in my heart</i>

00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:26,578
<i>* Our love has been
roaming apart</i>

00:00:26,606 --> 00:00:29,780

I try talking to you</i>

00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:31,789

00:00:31,811 --> 00:00:34,883

<i>best-selling author--
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

16
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:25,599
<i>a big round of applause
for Wes Wilson.</i>

17
00:02:26,793 --> 00:02:29,569
Thank you.
Making my way up to the stage.

18
00:02:29,595 --> 00:02:33,042
Yes. Yeah. Thank you.

19
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:35,774
Thank you. Yes.

20
00:02:36,803 --> 00:02:39,010
Hey. What's going down?

21
00:02:39,038 --> 00:02:40,813
You're smooth.

22
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,151
Boy, yes! Thank you, thank you.

23
00:02:44,177 --> 00:02:46,248
Thank you,
thank you very much.

24
00:02:48,815 --> 00:02:51,762
Just wanna say it's a great
honor to be here this evening

25
00:02:51,784 --> 00:02:55,061
and it truly does warm
my heart and soul

26
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:56,965
to see these gorgeous couples.

27
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:00,232
It just makes me think,
"Man, I am one heck of a writer!"

28
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:02,136
Yes!

29
00:03:02,161 --> 00:03:05,005
- That you are!
- Now seriously, I remember...

30
00:03:05,031 --> 00:03:08,205
way back when... when this was just
an idea floating around in my head.

31
00:03:08,234 --> 00:03:10,942
And I talked to my agent here,
Martin Rivera,

32
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,883
who told me to forget all about it.

33
00:03:13,906 --> 00:03:15,681
Way to go, Martin!

34
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:20,782
No, seriously, relationships--
the key is commitment, time

35
00:03:20,813 --> 00:03:24,351
and, most importantly, honesty.

36
00:03:24,783 --> 00:03:28,763
Yes. No, but seriously,
honesty-- honesty is the key.

37
00:03:28,788 --> 00:03:31,826
And if that fails, role-playing.

38
00:03:31,858 --> 00:03:34,668
All right. Perfect.

39
00:03:34,694 --> 00:03:38,073
Thank you very much.
Hold it up there.

40
00:03:38,097 --> 00:03:40,304
Right. Yeah.

41
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,813
We did it!

42
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,850
Oh, yeah.

43
00:03:48,841 --> 00:03:51,321
Here we go, ladies.

44
00:03:51,344 --> 00:03:53,119
Thank you very much.

45
00:03:55,381 --> 00:03:58,157
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you very, very much.

46
00:03:58,184 --> 00:04:01,028
Yes! Role-play, role-play!

47
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:05,692
Okay. Thanks.
Thank you very much.

48
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:08,934
Be whoever you want to be.
Enjoy yourself.

49
00:04:08,961 --> 00:04:13,068
All right, let's have plenty of people
on the dance floor.

50
00:04:15,201 --> 00:04:16,874
- Ladies.
- Pleased.

51
00:04:16,903 --> 00:04:19,383
- That look is working for you.
- You're better looking in person.

52
00:04:19,405 --> 00:04:22,411
Thank you, darling.

53
00:04:32,485 --> 00:04:35,830
Hey, can I have a vodka
and tonic, please?

54
00:04:35,855 --> 00:04:37,300
Coming right up.

55
00:04:37,323 --> 00:04:39,428
- Hey.
- Hey.

56
00:04:40,426 --> 00:04:43,305
I have kind of seen
you around.

57
00:04:46,465 --> 00:04:49,503
I'm-- I'm Wes.
I'm a writer.

58
00:04:50,736 --> 00:04:54,115
- No kidding.
- You probably saw the speech there.

59
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,952
I got...
a national best-seller.

60
00:05:00,012 --> 00:05:03,050
I'm actually working
on a new book now.

61
00:05:03,082 --> 00:05:05,790
Really? What is it about?

62
00:05:05,818 --> 00:05:07,991
It's all about
how to talk to women,

63
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,967
but I'm only on page 10.
How am I doing?

64
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:14,967
No, seriously,
you are absolutely gorgeous,

65
00:05:14,994 --> 00:05:17,031
and, just purely
for research purposes,

66
00:05:17,063 --> 00:05:19,907
is there anything I could say that
would get you to come up to my room?

67
00:05:19,932 --> 00:05:21,934
- No.
- Why not?

68
00:05:21,968 --> 00:05:25,506
Because you're just a writer.

69
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:38,119
Okay.

70
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,756
A challenge.

71
00:05:40,786 --> 00:05:43,858
You kicked your shoes off.
They're over there somewhere.

72
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:45,300
Hey, buddy.

73
00:05:47,526 --> 00:05:49,563
Creepy.

74
00:05:52,365 --> 00:05:56,108
- Nice dress.
- Thank you.

75
00:06:03,075 --> 00:06:05,487
I'm on my way.

76
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:09,823
- Hey, do you wanna dance?
- Okay, this one's for the lovers.

77
00:06:29,168 --> 00:06:32,274
Just follow me.

78
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:51,602
Samantha?

79
00:06:51,624 --> 00:06:55,231
Samantha?

80
00:06:55,261 --> 00:06:58,037
Yes.

81
00:06:59,332 --> 00:07:00,538
Yes.

82
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:04,571
- Would you marry me?
- Would you marry me?

83
00:07:04,603 --> 00:07:06,446
Yes.

84
00:07:06,972 --> 00:07:09,214
Yes!

85
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:15,422
Happy day, darling!

86
00:07:15,448 --> 00:07:19,123
They're getting married!

87
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:22,190
You love doing that,
don't you?

88
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:24,258
I plan on doing it
the rest of my life.

89
00:07:30,296 --> 00:07:33,209
<i>* Feel the heat</i>

90
00:07:33,232 --> 00:07:37,942
<i>* Then you'll see
I never say goodbye...</i>

91
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,941
Thank you very much!

92
00:07:41,974 --> 00:07:44,386
Mrs. Wilson,
ladies and gentlemen.

93
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:47,050
Now then,
let's get out of here.

94
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:49,650
- Hey.
- Marty? Marty Marty Marty.

95
00:07:49,682 --> 00:07:52,162
This is the girl I was telling
you about. This is Samantha.

96
00:07:52,184 --> 00:07:54,095
Samantha, this is Marty;
Marty, Sam.

97
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,999
Nice to finally meet you.
He said you were beautiful

98
00:07:57,022 --> 00:07:59,127
and he wasn't lying.
This is amazing. Hi.

99
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:03,106
- Thank you.
- So, engaged? Already.

100
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:05,473
- Yes.
- That's very quickly.

101
00:08:05,498 --> 00:08:07,978
Congratulations.

102
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,174
- It was love at first sight.
- Yes, it was.

103
00:08:11,203 --> 00:08:13,410
Well, when you know, you know?

104
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,079
Hey, that's actually
a good title for another book,

105
00:08:16,108 --> 00:08:19,954
maybe a follow-up to this. All right,
you guys, this is uncomfortable.

106
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:23,017
Um, you know what? There are
a couple of people I want you to meet.

107
00:08:23,048 --> 00:08:26,029
Marty, I love you.
We'll do it another time, okay?

108
00:08:26,051 --> 00:08:28,964
- Hold your body close to me...
- See you soon, Marty!

109
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:30,524
Later.

110
00:08:31,123 --> 00:08:33,163
Okay.

111
00:08:35,294 --> 00:08:37,807
Let's get you home.

112
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,506
Chilly, yeah.
Here you go, sweetie.

113
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:43,980
- Thank you.
- My God!

114
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:46,210
What a night. What a night.

115
00:08:46,238 --> 00:08:49,412
- I had a great time tonight.
- It was pretty perfect, wasn't it?

116
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:52,548
Oh my God. I gotta tell you,
you just look absolutely gorgeous.

117
00:08:52,578 --> 00:08:56,320
You are the most beautiful...

118
00:08:57,249 --> 00:08:59,127
Baby.

119
00:09:07,993 --> 00:09:11,202
Wes!

120
00:09:13,632 --> 00:09:16,738
Alicia,

121
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:19,340
where have you been?

122
00:09:19,371 --> 00:09:22,147
Where are my diamonds, Alicia?

123
00:09:23,642 --> 00:09:26,350
Maybe I didn't explain to you

124
00:09:26,378 --> 00:09:29,587
our retirement policy...

125
00:09:29,615 --> 00:09:31,652
there isn't one.

126
00:09:33,686 --> 00:09:36,257
Leave him alone.

127
00:09:36,288 --> 00:09:39,428
What's it like to lie
to the man you love?

128
00:09:42,628 --> 00:09:45,268
Hey, what's going on here?

129
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:51,048
Go to hell!

130
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:55,485
Last chance, Alicia.
What's it gonna be?

131
00:09:55,508 --> 00:09:58,318
Let him go.
I will get them for you.

132
00:10:17,296 --> 00:10:21,267
Fuck! Son of a bitch!
I'm gonna fuck you up.

133
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,802
Wes!

134
00:10:25,304 --> 00:10:30,276
You idiot! Put her in the car.

135
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:49,571
Sam!

136
00:10:51,463 --> 00:10:55,275
Where the hell
are you taking her?

137
00:10:59,171 --> 00:11:01,276
Dude, what happened?

138
00:11:01,307 --> 00:11:04,652
- Sir, hang in there, sir.
- 911. What's the emergency?

139
00:11:06,278 --> 00:11:08,519
There has been a robbery.
Someone's been mugged.

140
00:11:08,547 --> 00:11:10,424
- Are you with the victim now?
- God.

141
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:11,826
Yes.

142
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,353
<i>Okay, I'm gonna
need your location.</i>

143
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,190
<i>732, copy.</i>

144
00:11:40,212 --> 00:11:43,250
Service road 54,
under the I-90 overpass.

145
00:11:43,282 --> 00:11:46,195
I've got a possible 10-29 Victor.

146
00:11:46,218 --> 00:11:48,357
<i>Be safe, 732.</i>

147
00:13:27,686 --> 00:13:30,929
<i>Um, I'm really sorry
that it's taken me</i>

148
00:13:30,956 --> 00:13:34,301
so long to get
this together for you,

149
00:13:34,326 --> 00:13:37,466
but it's,
it's pretty standard, Mr. Wilson.

150
00:13:37,496 --> 00:13:41,376
By Washington state law,
her assets will remain in trust

151
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,745
until either a year passes
and the court declares her dead,

152
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:48,513
or her body is recovered.

153
00:13:49,908 --> 00:13:53,412
That's it right there.

154
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,052
Uh, Mr. Wilson,
do you understand?

155
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:02,762
You okay, buddy?

156
00:14:02,788 --> 00:14:06,702
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Okay. Well...

157
00:14:06,725 --> 00:14:10,798
you can continue to live
in the house that you both shared.

158
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:14,003
She also had a checking account

159
00:14:14,032 --> 00:14:17,809
at First Savings Bank in Seattle,

160
00:14:17,836 --> 00:14:21,443
and a safety deposit box
at Washington Trust in Spokane.

161
00:14:21,473 --> 00:14:24,317
- You, of course, get--
- Spokane?

162
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:27,586
Uh, yeah. You--
you didn't know about that?

163
00:14:27,613 --> 00:14:30,992
Until you called,
I didn't know she had a lawyer.

164
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,896
I guess we all have
little secrets, right?

165
00:14:38,056 --> 00:14:41,401
D-d-do you have
any other questions?

166
00:14:41,426 --> 00:14:44,407
How long have you been married?

167
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:49,905
I don't know, 11 years, I guess.

168
00:14:49,935 --> 00:14:51,915
Do you love your wife?

169
00:14:53,772 --> 00:14:55,774
Yeah, very much.

170
00:14:55,807 --> 00:14:59,380
Well, cherish every moment.

171
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:02,052
Um, okay. Well, listen,

172
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,618
thanks so much for coming in

173
00:15:05,651 --> 00:15:08,097
and please just feel free
to contact me.

174
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,464
- Thank you very much.
- Sure.

175
00:15:10,489 --> 00:15:12,799
Here you go.

176
00:15:15,093 --> 00:15:17,801
- I'm going on lunch, okay?
- Yeah.

177
00:15:36,582 --> 00:15:40,428
I'll tell you anything
that you want.

178
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,060
Um, look, he-- he--

179
00:15:47,092 --> 00:15:49,902
he gets the house,
he gets some cash

180
00:15:49,928 --> 00:15:52,875
and a-- and a--
and a box.

181
00:15:52,898 --> 00:15:56,778
- A safety deposit box.
- When does he get access?

182
00:15:56,802 --> 00:15:59,442
Um, in a-- in a year,

183
00:15:59,471 --> 00:16:02,577
when the court gives
its full authorization to the bank.

184
00:16:02,608 --> 00:16:04,952
It's all-- it's all right here
and it's all legal.

185
00:16:09,114 --> 00:16:12,652
Sir, listen to me,
I swear to God...

186
00:16:12,684 --> 00:16:15,164
I won't say a word to anybody.
I promise.

187
00:16:15,187 --> 00:16:17,531
I really don't give a shit.

188
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,899
Every person you tell,
I'm gonna send a piece of your wife,

189
00:16:21,927 --> 00:16:24,601
a piece of your kids--
a ear, finger, an eye.

190
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,839
- It doesn't matter to me.
- Okay, you know what?

191
00:16:27,866 --> 00:16:30,073
They-they don't--
I'm telling you right now.

192
00:16:30,102 --> 00:16:32,776
I-I-- listen to me.
Listen to me, okay?

193
00:16:32,804 --> 00:16:37,583
Look, I-I already told you I'm not
gonna say anything to anybody.

194
00:16:39,211 --> 00:16:41,782
No, no.

195
00:16:56,795 --> 00:16:59,935
<i>Attention, shoppers.

- Hey, there's my guy.
- Hey.

201
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,985
How is the sequel coming?

202
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:19,461
- Great. Just great.
- That good?

203
00:17:19,784 --> 00:17:23,489
I'm just having
a hard time getting motivated.

204
00:17:23,522 --> 00:17:26,628
That would get me motivated
right there.

205
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:30,635
Nah. She doesn't really look
like the relationship type.

206
00:17:30,662 --> 00:17:32,903
Who said anything
about a relationship?

207
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:35,969
All you need is to go...
in and out.

208
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:38,880
It's actually a good possible title.
Remind me to write that down.

209
00:17:40,138 --> 00:17:42,914
Look, it's time for you to start
thinking about casual dating again.

210
00:17:42,941 --> 00:17:46,081
- Yeah, I'll start thinking about it.
- You'd better start thinking about it!

211
00:17:46,111 --> 00:17:49,490
Because I literally live vicariously
through you. If you're not having sex,

212
00:17:49,514 --> 00:17:51,994
I'm not having sex. I'm getting
pretty fucking horny over here.

213
00:17:52,017 --> 00:17:53,257
I can tell.

214
00:17:53,285 --> 00:17:55,765
A couple of nights out
with some chicks like this

215
00:17:55,787 --> 00:17:58,597
will straighten you right out.
You can maybe have that one

216
00:17:58,623 --> 00:18:00,625
or that one.
Hi.

217
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:02,104
Hi.

218
00:18:02,127 --> 00:18:06,041
As a motivational speaker, you really
leave something to be desired.

219
00:18:06,064 --> 00:18:09,238
You just gotta give me some time.
I know it's been a year,

220
00:18:09,267 --> 00:18:12,009
but I was really madly in love
with Sam. It's how it is.

221
00:18:12,037 --> 00:18:14,074
I'm not asking you to stop
thinking about her.

222
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:16,882
I'm just saying
every guy needs a little...

223
00:18:17,308 --> 00:18:19,548
I'm taking care of myself.

224
00:18:19,578 --> 00:18:21,558
Sure you do. All right,
I'm gonna go have a smoke

225
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,787
- and leave you with some people.
- I thought you quit.

226
00:18:23,815 --> 00:18:25,954
Ah, good health is only gonna
keep me in bad marriage.

227
00:18:25,984 --> 00:18:29,022
Yeah. Hello.

228
00:18:29,054 --> 00:18:33,093
Wes-- Wes Wilson.
There we go.

229
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,129
Good luck finding love
in the 21st century.

230
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:44,041
Hi.

231
00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:47,744
Thank you.

232
00:18:47,773 --> 00:18:51,619
Oh! Excuse me. I'm sorry.

233
00:18:51,643 --> 00:18:53,953
Whoa, hey! God.
Everybody okay?

234
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:57,017
- Okay, yeah.
- No, I'm fine.

235
00:18:57,049 --> 00:18:59,655
Pick up a few of these things.

236
00:19:00,084 --> 00:19:01,755
I'm Wes.

237
00:19:01,787 --> 00:19:03,824
I am Nicole
and I know who you are.

238
00:19:03,855 --> 00:19:06,836
Of course, well, there's a huge
standee of me there.

239
00:19:06,858 --> 00:19:09,065
Look,

240
00:19:09,094 --> 00:19:12,598
I'm just gonna put it right there.
I am a big fan

241
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:14,577
and I write for the Seattle
"Woman's Book Weekly"

242
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:17,205
and I would just love
to do an interview with you.

243
00:19:17,235 --> 00:19:19,772
Oh, well, thank you very much.
I'm flattered.

244
00:19:19,805 --> 00:19:24,185
You're welcome. Not many writers
get a best-seller their first time out.

245
00:19:24,209 --> 00:19:26,746
Ah, beginner's luck.

246
00:19:26,778 --> 00:19:29,281
I read it twice.
Some really good stuff in there.

247
00:19:29,314 --> 00:19:31,191
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

248
00:19:31,216 --> 00:19:33,662
So did it help?
Are you married?

249
00:19:33,685 --> 00:19:36,859
- Uh, no-- no wife.
- Girlfriend?

250
00:19:36,888 --> 00:19:39,698
No-no, just me...
all alone.

251
00:19:39,724 --> 00:19:43,729
- So what's wrong with you?
- Pretty much everything.

252
00:19:43,762 --> 00:19:46,368
It doesn't look like it from here.

253
00:19:46,398 --> 00:19:49,743
Uh, thank you.

254
00:19:49,768 --> 00:19:50,974
Step right up.

255
00:19:51,002 --> 00:19:55,712
Uh, so the interview?
Does this weekend work?

256
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,981
I'm kind of busy
this weekend, actually.

257
00:19:58,009 --> 00:20:00,717
- What about tonight?
- Tonight?

258
00:20:00,746 --> 00:20:02,953
- Well--
- No time like the present.

259
00:20:02,981 --> 00:20:04,892
Here's my address.

260
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:08,762
Um, okay. Yeah, tonight.
Tonight could be good.

261
00:20:08,787 --> 00:20:11,324
Great.
So we meet around 7:00?

262
00:20:11,356 --> 00:20:14,132
- 7:00! 7:00. Nice to meet you.
- Okay. Nice to meet you.

263
00:20:17,028 --> 00:20:18,200
- Hi there.
- Hi.

264
00:20:20,832 --> 00:20:24,143
There you go.
Good luck.

265
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:26,740
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

266
00:20:26,871 --> 00:20:29,411
Your book is very inspirational.

267
00:20:29,441 --> 00:20:32,115
I've always said
it's not just for women.

268
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:36,387
I was in a relationship--
well, I thought I was in a relationship.

269
00:20:36,814 --> 00:20:39,258
But then I read your book.

270
00:20:39,284 --> 00:20:41,764
It was like you opened up
my mind and my eyes

271
00:20:41,786 --> 00:20:45,700
- and I saw things in a whole new light.
- Thank you very much.

272
00:20:45,724 --> 00:20:47,397
This girl I was seeing, well--

273
00:20:47,425 --> 00:20:49,803
she wasn't the girl
I thought she was.

274
00:20:49,828 --> 00:20:53,708
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
What happened?

275
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:57,703
She just disappeared.

276
00:20:59,104 --> 00:21:01,983
Uh, well, would you
like me to sign it?

277
00:21:02,007 --> 00:21:03,953
I can dedicate the book,
if you like.

278
00:21:03,975 --> 00:21:06,353
I want you to make it out
to my new girlfriend.

279
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:09,188
- Okay.
- Audrey.

280
00:21:09,214 --> 00:21:13,924
I want you to put, "Diamonds
are a girl's best friend..."

281
00:21:13,952 --> 00:21:16,193
"Diamonds are...

282
00:21:16,221 --> 00:21:19,293
a girl's best friend.

283
00:21:19,324 --> 00:21:22,771
Wes Wilson."

284
00:21:22,794 --> 00:21:25,104
There you go.

285
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,736
I'll make sure
this one doesn't disappear.

286
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:33,610
Nice, huh?

287
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:37,609
Fan base is expanding.
This is big. This is really big.

288
00:21:53,725 --> 00:21:55,796
Hello?

289
00:21:55,827 --> 00:21:59,240
Hello?
Dude, I know you're there,

290
00:21:59,264 --> 00:22:02,336
sitting there watching the machine
as I talk, little bastard.

291
00:22:02,367 --> 00:22:05,746
Look, remember, this is just
an interview with a super hot girl

292
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,841
with a super hot body,
all right?

293
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,443
Just have fun.
Maybe she'll inspire you.

294
00:22:10,475 --> 00:22:13,513
Don't forget to tell me all about it.

295
00:22:13,545 --> 00:22:16,992
- You know I love this shit.
- All right.

296
00:23:09,834 --> 00:23:13,077
- Wes?
- Hi.

297
00:23:13,104 --> 00:23:15,209
You can see me? Hi.

298
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,414
- Come on up.
- What do I push?

299
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,155
Hi.

300
00:23:27,185 --> 00:23:29,096
How long have you been
out there?

301
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,100
Feels like my whole life.

302
00:23:31,122 --> 00:23:33,602
You wanna come in?

303
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:36,504
- Sure. Yeah.
- Come in. Get out of the rain.

304
00:23:36,528 --> 00:23:39,236
Well, let me get you
out of these clothes here.

305
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,574
Don't you think we should talk first?

306
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:45,172
- I mean--
- You'll find a robe behind my door.

307
00:23:45,203 --> 00:23:47,911
- Are we going out though?
- It's a mess outside.

308
00:23:47,939 --> 00:23:50,886
I thought we'd stay in.

309
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:53,480
Okay.

310
00:23:54,512 --> 00:23:56,389
Oh, gosh.

311
00:23:56,414 --> 00:23:59,361
- It's a nice place you have here.
- Thanks. It's a rental.

312
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,423
- What?
- You in that robe.

313
00:24:04,456 --> 00:24:08,165
Oh. It's cozy.

314
00:24:08,193 --> 00:24:10,537
- Let's open some wine.
- Thank you.

315
00:24:10,562 --> 00:24:13,941
- I take it you don't date much, huh?
- It's been a little while.

316
00:24:13,965 --> 00:24:15,967
Is there a reason?

317
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,071
Uh, well, it's kind of a long story.

318
00:24:18,103 --> 00:24:20,014
I was in this, um--

319
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:22,541
uh, well, I'm writing
a new book and--

320
00:24:22,574 --> 00:24:25,418
- Oh, really? What is it about?
- I don't know.

321
00:24:27,345 --> 00:24:30,224
Hey, you should laugh.
I'm completely lost-- writer's block.

322
00:24:30,248 --> 00:24:32,387
- Well, you know what they say.
- What do they say?

323
00:24:32,417 --> 00:24:34,397
- Write what you know.
- I don't think

324
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:36,899
anybody would be too interested
in my dull life.

325
00:24:36,921 --> 00:24:39,595
You'd be surprised. I mean,
my readers are sure interested.

326
00:24:39,624 --> 00:24:42,264
Right, right, the interview.

327
00:24:42,293 --> 00:24:44,933
After dinner...

328
00:24:44,963 --> 00:24:47,569
when we're more relaxed.

329
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:50,045
Good?

330
00:24:50,068 --> 00:24:52,708
Yummy.

331
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,119
So I didn't really wanna be a writer.

332
00:24:58,142 --> 00:25:00,918
I wanted to be a teacher.

333
00:25:00,945 --> 00:25:05,018
Yeah? Well,

334
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,293
what's something only your closest
friends would know about you?

335
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:10,697
I'm a hell of a dancer!

336
00:25:10,722 --> 00:25:12,998
- Really?!
- Yeah.

337
00:25:13,024 --> 00:25:15,163
I'll show you some love here.

338
00:25:17,395 --> 00:25:19,895
Yeah, here we go.

339
00:25:21,332 --> 00:25:23,141
Big moves.
Ready?

340
00:25:23,168 --> 00:25:25,079
Okay. Hey, yep!

341
00:25:25,103 --> 00:25:27,413
- Look at that-- skibbitydoo!
- Impressive.

342
00:25:27,838 --> 00:25:30,282
Spinning! Oh, shit.

343
00:25:30,308 --> 00:25:33,482
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think I just hurt myself.

344
00:25:35,346 --> 00:25:37,788
Okay, okay.

345
00:25:38,116 --> 00:25:39,720
- Wes?
- Yeah?

346
00:25:39,751 --> 00:25:41,594
Are you ever gonna
put your clothes back on?

347
00:25:41,619 --> 00:25:43,462
No.

348
00:25:43,488 --> 00:25:47,265
Well, in that case...

349
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:52,200
Whoa, easy.

350
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,701
Afraid I'll take advantage?

351
00:25:54,732 --> 00:25:58,578
I'm horrified at the thought
of not remembering.

352
00:25:58,603 --> 00:26:01,379
Oh, trust me, you'd remember.

353
00:26:07,045 --> 00:26:09,548
All right, um,
I'll go get my notebook

354
00:26:09,581 --> 00:26:12,562
and maybe your clothes.

355
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:56,566
What...

356
00:26:56,594 --> 00:26:58,767
the hell?

357
00:27:13,845 --> 00:27:16,724
Hi, Wes. The interview
we did was published today

358
00:27:16,748 --> 00:27:18,988
and I'll bring home a copy for you.

359
00:27:19,417 --> 00:27:22,694
I thought we could celebrate.
I'm gonna pick up some stuff tonight.

360
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,724
Do you want pasta or fish...

361
00:27:25,757 --> 00:27:28,067
or I don't know,
maybe you wanna go out.

362
00:27:28,092 --> 00:27:31,437
Maybe you're tired of my cooking.

363
00:27:31,462 --> 00:27:33,339
Hello?
Are you there?

364
00:27:33,364 --> 00:27:35,776
Wes?

365
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,771
Anyways we can decide later. All right,
I'll see you soon, honey. Goodbye, babe.

366
00:27:55,419 --> 00:27:57,565
Oh, Jesus!

367
00:27:57,589 --> 00:27:59,694
I forgot that stupid cat.

368
00:28:05,563 --> 00:28:07,668
Hello?!

369
00:28:07,699 --> 00:28:09,701
I have a gun.

370
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:57,583
Wes, where are you, buddy?

371
00:28:57,615 --> 00:29:00,755
Yeah, I'm down here--
in the cellar.

372
00:29:02,653 --> 00:29:04,530
Where are you, man?

373
00:29:04,955 --> 00:29:06,694
Oh shit.

374
00:29:10,495 --> 00:29:12,839
- I'm in here. Get in here!
- Yeah.

375
00:29:12,864 --> 00:29:17,711
I got the check for the thing.

376
00:29:18,803 --> 00:29:20,714
What the hell is this?

377
00:29:20,738 --> 00:29:24,618
I have absolutely no idea. Sam got
this house from some little old guy.

378
00:29:24,642 --> 00:29:28,590
As far as I know, she hated guns,
hated small spaces.

379
00:29:28,613 --> 00:29:30,524
Maybe he was one
of those weapons wackos,

380
00:29:30,548 --> 00:29:34,360
like the guys who sell knives on the
home-shopping network or something.

381
00:29:34,385 --> 00:29:37,423
I think this is a little high tech
for that little old guy.

382
00:29:37,455 --> 00:29:40,732
Somebody was just in here.

383
00:29:51,669 --> 00:29:55,684
Sam, what the hell were you into?

384
00:29:55,707 --> 00:29:58,620
Is there anything
you're not telling me, man?

385
00:29:58,643 --> 00:30:02,591
I'm just as much in the dark
as you are.

386
00:30:11,489 --> 00:30:13,526
What am I signing here?

387
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:15,834
It's just a release form.

388
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:20,741
And in it you will find
Samantha's death certificate,

389
00:30:20,765 --> 00:30:23,769
an authorization letter
and the key to her safety deposit box.

390
00:30:23,801 --> 00:30:25,974
You will need all 3
to gain access.

391
00:30:26,003 --> 00:30:30,918
Also in there is the final papers
and the deed for your house.

392
00:30:30,942 --> 00:30:34,014
That's, that's everything.

393
00:30:34,045 --> 00:30:38,357
- I can't believe it's been a year.
- Well, I guess time flies, doesn't it?

394
00:30:39,917 --> 00:30:41,658
Uh, well--

395
00:30:41,686 --> 00:30:44,599
What happened to your finger?

396
00:30:44,622 --> 00:30:48,729
Uh, well, I-- I have
a bit of a woodworking hobby

397
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,639
- and I cut it with a table saw.
- Ouch.

398
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:56,669
Um, Maggie, would you
excuse us for a second?

399
00:31:01,405 --> 00:31:03,646
Mr. Wilson,

400
00:31:03,674 --> 00:31:05,676
how well did you know
Samantha?

401
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:09,556
Because I actually
never met her.

402
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,959
See, I had her will on file
with instructions to contact you

403
00:31:12,984 --> 00:31:15,055
if anything
should happen to her.

404
00:31:16,354 --> 00:31:18,698
Well, in February
I went to pay her taxes,

405
00:31:18,723 --> 00:31:21,966
but her Social came back
as non-existent.

406
00:31:21,993 --> 00:31:25,634
I tried to contact her
at her workplace-- Atlantic Traders.

407
00:31:25,663 --> 00:31:30,408
I just-- I tried again thinking
that maybe I had the wrong number.

408
00:31:31,502 --> 00:31:36,076
Mr. Wilson, Atlantic Traders--
it doesn't exist.

409
00:31:37,341 --> 00:31:39,514
Um, well, I-I--

410
00:31:39,544 --> 00:31:41,990
I guess that's it.

411
00:31:46,918 --> 00:31:49,922
Well, be careful
with that table saw.

412
00:32:50,147 --> 00:32:52,194
Hi, honey.

413
00:32:55,586 --> 00:32:57,588
Wes, what happened?

414
00:32:57,622 --> 00:33:00,432
You know, I can't find a single thing
to tell me who she was or--

415
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:03,132
her job didn't exist,
her name didn't exist!

416
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,438
- Baby.
- "Finding Love in the 21st Century,"

417
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:10,412
by Wes Wilson-- fraud!
I couldn't tell you the first thing

418
00:33:10,434 --> 00:33:12,471
about the woman
I was gonna marry!

419
00:33:12,503 --> 00:33:14,881
Wes, I've always had this belief

420
00:33:14,906 --> 00:33:17,750
you can spend a lifetime with
someone and never really know them.

421
00:33:17,775 --> 00:33:21,689
Oh, God, is that supposed to help?

422
00:33:21,712 --> 00:33:25,125
Nic, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
said that. It was rude.

423
00:33:25,149 --> 00:33:27,493
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

424
00:33:27,518 --> 00:33:29,464
This has nothing to do with you.

425
00:33:29,487 --> 00:33:31,694
If you want some answers,
why don't you just go to Spokane

426
00:33:31,722 --> 00:33:35,568
and open that safety deposit box, okay?
I mean, who knows what can be inside?

427
00:33:35,593 --> 00:33:37,470
I'll go with you.

428
00:33:37,495 --> 00:33:39,702
This doesn't concern you.

429
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:43,610
Baby, everything about you
concerns me, okay?

430
00:33:43,634 --> 00:33:46,478
I care about you.
I worry about you.

431
00:33:46,504 --> 00:33:48,711
Please. Okay?

432
00:33:51,542 --> 00:33:53,613
I really wanna thank you

433
00:33:53,644 --> 00:33:56,955
for coming along with me
on this journey.

434
00:33:56,981 --> 00:33:58,983
It's been great.

435
00:33:59,016 --> 00:34:01,963
So what do you think
is in the box?

436
00:34:01,986 --> 00:34:04,125
I don't know.
It could be more guns.

437
00:34:04,155 --> 00:34:07,068
Crazy, I don't know what
she was doing with that arsenal.

438
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,670
I guess I really didn't know her
all that well.

439
00:34:30,948 --> 00:34:33,019
Oh, yeah.

440
00:34:39,824 --> 00:34:42,828
Just a little nervous.

441
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,103
We just gotta go slow.
It's been a little while.

442
00:34:47,564 --> 00:34:49,608
This is very--

443
00:34:53,671 --> 00:34:56,277
Yeah, this could be
a long session.

444
00:34:56,707 --> 00:34:58,184
All right.

445
00:34:58,209 --> 00:35:00,587
- Shit, get off me!
- What? What?

446
00:35:00,611 --> 00:35:02,716
Someone's on the balcony.

447
00:35:02,747 --> 00:35:05,159
- What are you talking about?
- I'm serious.

448
00:35:05,182 --> 00:35:08,026
What are you talking about?

449
00:35:08,052 --> 00:35:10,760
I don't see anyone.

450
00:35:10,788 --> 00:35:14,258
I tell you
somebody is out there.

451
00:35:15,259 --> 00:35:18,103
Well, it's a good thing
they left.

452
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:20,735
I could have shown you
how tough I am.

453
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:23,939
Just how tough are you?!

454
00:35:23,968 --> 00:35:26,512
Yes, you are a tough woman.

455
00:35:28,973 --> 00:35:31,647
Uh, it's been so long

456
00:35:31,675 --> 00:35:33,279
since I've been with a--

457
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:37,122
- Hey, you know what it says here?
- What's that?

458
00:35:37,148 --> 00:35:39,890
That "all relationships
should be based

459
00:35:39,917 --> 00:35:42,921
on a certain kind of commonality."

460
00:35:42,953 --> 00:35:44,990
- A what?
- Commonality.

461
00:35:45,022 --> 00:35:49,129
That "the opposites may attract,
but in reality it's the very attraction

462
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:53,108
that leads to the demise of the same
relationship in the long run."

463
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:56,942
Like 2 fucking potheads
can stay together forever, right?

464
00:35:56,967 --> 00:35:59,277
Yeah yeah, this guy is smart.

465
00:35:59,303 --> 00:36:03,843
Listen to this: "If one likes
camping in the outdoors,

466
00:36:03,874 --> 00:36:06,286
and the other is inclined
to like room service,

467
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:10,122
the relationship could be put
under constant stress

468
00:36:10,147 --> 00:36:13,094
because both parties
don't share a common interest."

469
00:36:13,117 --> 00:36:16,792
- Sounds like a contract.
- That's is what it says.

470
00:36:16,821 --> 00:36:20,291
"Because ultimately
all relationships

471
00:36:20,324 --> 00:36:22,634
are like a contract."

472
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:25,334
I ought to write a fucking book.

473
00:36:25,362 --> 00:36:27,899
Yeah.
"Both parties have to agree

474
00:36:27,932 --> 00:36:31,778
whether consciously
or subconsciously

475
00:36:31,802 --> 00:36:33,679
to be there for each other."

476
00:36:33,704 --> 00:36:37,675
Fucking deep. This guy's got
some head on his shoulders.

477
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:39,244
Yeah.

478
00:37:06,837 --> 00:37:09,340
This girl I was seeing,

479
00:37:09,373 --> 00:37:12,286
well, she wasn't the girl
I thought she was.

480
00:37:15,846 --> 00:37:17,848
She just...

481
00:37:17,882 --> 00:37:19,987
disappeared.

482
00:37:49,213 --> 00:37:51,318
Mr. Wilson.

483
00:37:51,348 --> 00:37:54,295
Hey, "diamonds are
a girl's best friend," right?

484
00:37:54,718 --> 00:37:57,390
Your book helped me
get in where I fit in.

485
00:37:57,421 --> 00:38:00,402
- Oh, good.
- My name is Isaac Kahn.

486
00:38:00,424 --> 00:38:03,200
I'm here on behalf
of Atlantic Traders.

487
00:38:03,227 --> 00:38:06,970
- Really?
- I take it Samantha never mentioned us.

488
00:38:06,997 --> 00:38:10,069
No, no, she never mentioned
anybody she worked with.

489
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,410
Well, we're here to help.

490
00:38:12,436 --> 00:38:16,009
Why don't you get in the car
and we'll talk?

491
00:38:17,975 --> 00:38:20,114
I don't think so.

492
00:38:20,144 --> 00:38:23,216
Mr. Wilson, we're very sorry
about your loss

493
00:38:23,247 --> 00:38:25,454
and are here to assist
in any way we can.

494
00:38:25,482 --> 00:38:27,291
So what is this about?

495
00:38:31,288 --> 00:38:35,168
Several small matters have
been brought to my attention.

496
00:38:35,192 --> 00:38:37,365
Inventory she handled for us

497
00:38:37,394 --> 00:38:40,307
has been mixed up
in her personal assets.

498
00:38:40,331 --> 00:38:42,504
What kind of stuff
did she do for you guys?

499
00:38:42,533 --> 00:38:45,412
- Assorted buying and selling overseas.
- Really?

500
00:38:45,436 --> 00:38:47,416
Alicia--

501
00:38:47,438 --> 00:38:51,443
Samantha was one of my best employees,
a major loss to the company.

502
00:38:51,475 --> 00:38:55,355
So a year later with condolences?
Where were you when I called last year?

503
00:38:55,379 --> 00:38:57,825
Well, I do travel a lot

504
00:38:57,848 --> 00:39:01,921
and I never received any messages.
My sincerest apologies.

505
00:39:01,952 --> 00:39:05,058
I really needed answers last year.
So, thank you,

506
00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:07,091
thank you very much.

507
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:13,467
Have some coffee.

508
00:39:19,503 --> 00:39:23,144
He's gonna regret that one.

509
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,832
Excuse me, ladies. Sorry.

510
00:39:50,901 --> 00:39:53,074
Oh, shit.

511
00:39:58,309 --> 00:40:00,550
- Easy!
- Watch out!

512
00:40:00,578 --> 00:40:02,489
Get the fuck out of here!

513
00:40:05,315 --> 00:40:07,022
Come on!

514
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,426
- Up here.
- Hey, hey!

515
00:40:17,428 --> 00:40:19,999
Wait!

516
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,176
Over there!

517
00:40:38,248 --> 00:40:40,558
- Yeah?
- Do you have him yet?

518
00:40:40,584 --> 00:40:42,962
- We lost him, boss. Sorry.
- Of course you did.

519
00:40:42,986 --> 00:40:45,091
- Meet me in the alley.
- Let's go!

520
00:40:53,363 --> 00:40:54,467
Hey!

521
00:41:00,938 --> 00:41:02,611
Shit.

522
00:41:28,065 --> 00:41:30,705
Don't kill him.

523
00:41:34,505 --> 00:41:36,576
Get me out of here, Chauncey.

524
00:41:36,607 --> 00:41:39,213
- Yes, sir.
- Hey!

525
00:41:39,643 --> 00:41:41,382
After him!

526
00:41:44,948 --> 00:41:48,395
Hey, where is he going?!

527
00:41:55,025 --> 00:41:58,131
You put me
in a peculiar spot, Mr. Wilson.

528
00:41:58,162 --> 00:41:59,698
Oh, shit.

529
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:03,644
You chose to be rude
when I tried to be nice.

530
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:07,240
So now we do it this way.

531
00:42:10,107 --> 00:42:11,677
- You will go to the bank--
- What?

532
00:42:11,708 --> 00:42:16,214
a simple withdrawal.
Your fiancée stole something from me

533
00:42:16,246 --> 00:42:18,123
and I want it back.

534
00:42:18,148 --> 00:42:19,719
No!

535
00:42:23,987 --> 00:42:27,958
I trust we will see you
at the bank at 11:00 AM?

536
00:42:27,991 --> 00:42:31,700
And if you and your lady friend
wanna make it home in one piece,

537
00:42:31,728 --> 00:42:34,504
you'll do as I say.

538
00:42:35,499 --> 00:42:38,605
Wait, wait, wait...
This is crazy.

539
00:42:38,635 --> 00:42:40,672
Samantha couldn't
have stolen anything.

540
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,749
My dear boy,
you have no idea.

541
00:42:46,777 --> 00:42:49,018
Why don't you tell me then?

542
00:42:52,515 --> 00:42:54,558
Oh, my ribs.

543
00:43:07,064 --> 00:43:09,066
Oh, God.

544
00:43:17,774 --> 00:43:20,345
Hey, watch it, man.

545
00:43:24,515 --> 00:43:27,291
He's been gone way too long.

546
00:43:27,317 --> 00:43:29,194
I understand.

547
00:43:29,219 --> 00:43:30,823
Someone's at the door.
I gotta go.

548
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:34,734
Nicole?

549
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:37,402
Oh, sh--

550
00:43:37,427 --> 00:43:40,203
Jesus Christ, don't shoot me.
I just went to get some breakfast.

551
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:42,232
Jesus, baby, what happened?

552
00:43:42,266 --> 00:43:44,712
Oh, shit, yeah.

553
00:43:44,735 --> 00:43:48,706
Some guy from Sam's work--
not so nice.

554
00:43:48,739 --> 00:43:51,219
He said she stole
something of his.

555
00:43:51,241 --> 00:43:53,380
He thinks it's
in her safety deposit box.

556
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:55,617
What? This is crazy.
We should call the police.

557
00:43:55,646 --> 00:43:59,219
No! No, no, he knows where I live.
He knows all about you.

558
00:43:59,249 --> 00:44:01,593
- Me?
- Yeah. He called you "my lady friend."

559
00:44:01,618 --> 00:44:03,598
Now I'm scared.
What are we gonna do?

560
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,327
He wants me to go the bank,

561
00:44:05,355 --> 00:44:08,302
give him whatever the hell's
in the safety deposit box.

562
00:44:08,325 --> 00:44:10,828
You see this?
It's only gonna get worse.

563
00:44:10,861 --> 00:44:15,276
- I'm just gonna do what he says.
- They really worked you over.

564
00:44:15,299 --> 00:44:18,371
You should see the other guys.
They're perfectly fine.

565
00:44:18,402 --> 00:44:20,404
Listen,

566
00:44:20,437 --> 00:44:22,781
I really don't think
you should come with me.

567
00:44:22,806 --> 00:44:25,412
- Why?
- Clearly, it's not safe.

568
00:44:25,442 --> 00:44:30,187
After this, you're not leaving me
here alone, okay? I'm going with you.

569
00:44:30,213 --> 00:44:33,683
All right. Oh, Christ,
I'm just a writer.

570
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,890
It hurts.
My head, it--

571
00:44:45,595 --> 00:44:48,405
- Somebody wants to see you.
- Oh, come on, let's get--

572
00:44:49,432 --> 00:44:51,174
Oh, Jesus!

573
00:44:52,202 --> 00:44:53,806
Get off him! Get off him!

574
00:44:53,837 --> 00:44:55,413
Enough!

575
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,642
Let's go.

576
00:45:02,479 --> 00:45:04,516
So...

577
00:45:04,548 --> 00:45:06,550
okay.

578
00:45:07,618 --> 00:45:10,895
Inside the car, please,
Mr. Wilson.

579
00:45:11,321 --> 00:45:13,162
I'm getting out of there!

580
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:15,170
Okay.

581
00:45:35,312 --> 00:45:38,623
Once again for me,
if you will, Mr. Wilson.

582
00:45:38,648 --> 00:45:41,822
I go into the bank,
get the contents of the box,

583
00:45:41,852 --> 00:45:45,595
put it in this bag
and hand it over to you.

584
00:45:45,622 --> 00:45:48,603
And if you don't do as I ask?

585
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:51,834
- You will kill Nicole.
- And who else?

586
00:45:51,862 --> 00:45:55,400
- Me.
- Excellent student, Mr. Wilson.

587
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,670
- I'll be back as soon as possible.
- Okay.

588
00:46:10,714 --> 00:46:12,250
What the hell is this?

589
00:46:12,282 --> 00:46:14,660
Mr. Boone will
accompany you inside.

590
00:46:14,685 --> 00:46:16,926
- Why?
- Insurance, Mr. Wilson.

591
00:46:16,954 --> 00:46:19,696
The girl isn't enough?

592
00:46:19,723 --> 00:46:22,533
They rarely are.

593
00:46:24,528 --> 00:46:26,633
See you in a minute.

594
00:46:36,006 --> 00:46:38,350
Hi, what's your name?

595
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:39,979
Excuse me.
Miss, where are the boxes?

596
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:42,786
- What?
- Sorry. The...

597
00:46:42,813 --> 00:46:44,884
safety deposit boxes.
I need to get in there.

598
00:46:44,915 --> 00:46:47,623
- I need to see your key.
- Oh, right.

599
00:46:47,651 --> 00:46:49,824
I also have a letter
from the court

600
00:46:49,853 --> 00:46:53,266
authorizing me.
And the death certificate's here.

601
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:55,566
- Passport.
- Right.

602
00:46:55,592 --> 00:46:57,799
Passport. Hang on.

603
00:46:57,828 --> 00:47:01,037
- There it is.
- Please have a seat.

604
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:04,970
Sign here, please.

605
00:47:17,681 --> 00:47:22,790
You know that book you wrote talking
about gender roles and relationships?

606
00:47:22,819 --> 00:47:27,325
You know, the guy should cook
for his wife once a week?

607
00:47:27,357 --> 00:47:30,270
Any recipes you recommend?

608
00:47:30,293 --> 00:47:32,705
Mr. Wilson, how do you do?

609
00:47:32,729 --> 00:47:34,606
- I'm Jeff McKenzie.
- Yeah, hi.

610
00:47:37,766 --> 00:47:39,610
Well, then,

611
00:47:39,636 --> 00:47:42,549
- I'm very sorry to hear of your loss.
- Thank you.

612
00:47:42,572 --> 00:47:44,677
If you will.

613
00:48:05,462 --> 00:48:06,702
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

614
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:09,040
If you need anything else...

615
00:48:09,066 --> 00:48:10,875
Okay.

616
00:48:10,901 --> 00:48:13,711
- Open it!
- I'm opening it.

617
00:48:15,972 --> 00:48:17,349
Okay.

618
00:48:23,079 --> 00:48:26,788
Come on, let me just-- just let me
have a look inside the thing.

619
00:48:26,816 --> 00:48:29,524
Damn thing.
Come on, man.

620
00:48:29,553 --> 00:48:32,033
- This belongs to us. Thank you.
- Yeah.

621
00:48:35,125 --> 00:48:38,595
Psycho, psycho, psycho.

622
00:48:47,137 --> 00:48:50,414
Come on, let me just have
a look in the box. Come on!

623
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,386
Hey. No!

624
00:48:52,409 --> 00:48:55,515
- Wes.
- Shit.

625
00:48:55,545 --> 00:48:58,389
- Are you all right? Come here.
- Get what he wanted?

626
00:48:58,415 --> 00:49:01,123
- I don't know. There was a case.
- Honey, what was in it?

627
00:49:01,151 --> 00:49:03,392
- I don't know. He just took it.
- Anything else?

628
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,956
- Mr. Wilson?
- That was it.

629
00:49:04,988 --> 00:49:07,093
You left your bag in the vault.
Is everything all right?

630
00:49:07,123 --> 00:49:08,898
Just keep it.

631
00:49:08,925 --> 00:49:12,134
All right, let's just get
out of here. Come on.

632
00:49:12,162 --> 00:49:15,541
Ah, thank God
they didn't hurt you.

633
00:49:23,707 --> 00:49:25,482
What are we gonna do?

634
00:49:25,509 --> 00:49:28,490
Let's go back to the hotel,
pack and get out of this nightmare.

635
00:49:51,935 --> 00:49:54,609
They got what they wanted.
Sam is gone.

636
00:49:54,637 --> 00:49:56,913
I just wanna move on
with my life.

637
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:00,945
Yeah, maybe you're right.
Sam would have wanted it that way.

638
00:50:00,977 --> 00:50:04,083
She's trying to fuck with us.

639
00:50:04,114 --> 00:50:06,720
I won't let that happen.

640
00:50:17,694 --> 00:50:20,903
I've got an idea. We make this whole
thing move a little bit faster.

641
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:25,037
Why don't you go get the car,
I'll get the bags?

642
00:50:25,068 --> 00:50:27,480
Okay, I'll see you in a minute.

643
00:50:41,617 --> 00:50:43,723
Okay.

644
00:50:49,993 --> 00:50:52,564
Wes.

645
00:50:52,595 --> 00:50:56,907
- Oh, holy shit!
- I'm so sorry.

646
00:50:56,933 --> 00:50:59,846
Oh, this is crazy. This is not
happening. Who the hell are you?

647
00:50:59,869 --> 00:51:03,078
- I have put you through so much.
- You've put me through so much?

648
00:51:03,106 --> 00:51:05,746
You have no idea what the hell
I've been through. This is insane.

649
00:51:05,775 --> 00:51:08,483
Wes, you need to listen.
I don't have much time.

650
00:51:08,511 --> 00:51:10,218
What the hell
are you doing here?

651
00:51:10,246 --> 00:51:14,194
Please. This is just crazy. Tell me--
tell me this is a dream, please.

652
00:51:15,251 --> 00:51:17,197
It's not.

653
00:51:19,022 --> 00:51:21,525
I'm only here to warn you.

654
00:51:21,558 --> 00:51:23,196
But you're a little late.

655
00:51:23,226 --> 00:51:27,140
Wes, this is really important.
I need you to meet me under the bridge

656
00:51:27,163 --> 00:51:29,074
near the clock tower, alone.

657
00:51:29,099 --> 00:51:31,636
Now hold-- hold on.
You've been dead for a year.

658
00:51:31,668 --> 00:51:34,547
I've been chased around
by these fricking weirdoes.

659
00:51:34,571 --> 00:51:36,778
Now you want me to follow you
to God knows where?

660
00:51:36,806 --> 00:51:38,979
I mean, didn't you care
about me at all?

661
00:51:39,009 --> 00:51:41,080
Of course.

662
00:51:41,111 --> 00:51:43,591
I was trying to protect you.

663
00:51:43,613 --> 00:51:45,524
Well, you're doing a hell of a job.

664
00:51:45,548 --> 00:51:48,529
I've barely been gone a year
and you're already screwing around.

665
00:51:48,551 --> 00:51:51,725
Oh, no. Time out, time out.
You were supposed to be dead.

666
00:51:51,755 --> 00:51:54,531
That woman you're with
wants what Isaac wants.

667
00:51:54,557 --> 00:51:57,299
That's insane, completely insane.

668
00:51:57,327 --> 00:51:59,534
I know I have
a lot of explaining to do.

669
00:51:59,562 --> 00:52:02,042
- You think?
- But the less you know the better.

670
00:52:02,065 --> 00:52:04,136
So then it's true.
You did steal from him?

671
00:52:04,167 --> 00:52:07,671
Look, meet me by the clock tower
in the park. And lose the girl.

672
00:52:07,704 --> 00:52:09,741
What?

673
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,251
- Oh my God.
- I have to go.

674
00:52:12,275 --> 00:52:13,948
- What?
- We need to split up.

675
00:52:13,977 --> 00:52:16,253
Remember, clock tower,
lose the girl.

676
00:52:34,163 --> 00:52:35,836
Yeah, he's upstairs.

677
00:52:38,902 --> 00:52:41,940
Okay. I'll wait for your instructions.

678
00:52:41,971 --> 00:52:43,973
All right.

679
00:53:09,366 --> 00:53:12,210
Hey, honey.
How have you been?

680
00:53:12,235 --> 00:53:16,047
Good, just pretending
to be dead for a year.

681
00:53:19,876 --> 00:53:21,116
Get down!

682
00:53:22,444 --> 00:53:24,148
Oh, Jesus!

683
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:27,795
Let's go!

684
00:53:31,121 --> 00:53:32,327
What the hell?

685
00:53:32,355 --> 00:53:35,802
Oh, Jesus.

686
00:53:35,825 --> 00:53:38,328
Come on, this way.

687
00:53:38,761 --> 00:53:40,773
Get out of the way!

688
00:53:42,332 --> 00:53:45,336
- Watch out! Wes--
- The gun--

689
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:51,317
- God, he's shooting.
- Get out of my way.

690
00:54:16,032 --> 00:54:18,205
I've got him!

691
00:54:18,234 --> 00:54:20,271
- Hang on.
- Hold him back.

692
00:54:20,303 --> 00:54:22,408
You're going down!

693
00:54:29,145 --> 00:54:31,716
Wes, get down.

694
00:54:53,803 --> 00:54:55,908
You killed him!

695
00:54:55,938 --> 00:54:59,909
- What the hell is going on?!
- I worked for Isaac.

696
00:54:59,943 --> 00:55:03,117
- Wow, I didn't know you at all, did I?
- Look,

697
00:55:03,146 --> 00:55:06,457
I stole $10 million in diamonds
and a list of Isaac's special contacts.

698
00:55:06,482 --> 00:55:08,860
He wants it back.

699
00:55:08,885 --> 00:55:11,229
What the hell kind of business
is this guy in?

700
00:55:11,254 --> 00:55:15,202
He smuggles guns,
weapons, jewels-- whatever.

701
00:55:15,224 --> 00:55:17,363
- So what? He thinks I have the gems?
- Well, we will.

702
00:55:17,393 --> 00:55:19,930
And he won't stop
until we're dead and he has it all.

703
00:55:19,963 --> 00:55:22,204
So what? What-what-what
what do we do?

704
00:55:22,231 --> 00:55:24,871
So lose the girl
and meet me where I said.

705
00:55:24,901 --> 00:55:26,706
I have a plan.

706
00:55:27,036 --> 00:55:29,209
Just trust me.

707
00:55:35,011 --> 00:55:37,992
I'm just a writer!

708
00:55:38,014 --> 00:55:41,188
- Honey, do you have the keys?
- Yeah, I do.

709
00:56:08,811 --> 00:56:11,087
It's a nice spring day.

710
00:56:16,519 --> 00:56:21,298
Cops. And I've got
the murder weapon-- perfect.

711
00:56:39,909 --> 00:56:41,911
Check it out.

712
00:57:59,021 --> 00:58:02,025
Coffee, please. Black.

713
00:58:05,394 --> 00:58:07,396
Thank you.

714
00:58:11,034 --> 00:58:13,412
I love this town.

715
00:58:13,436 --> 00:58:16,417
My dad used to bring me here
when I was little.

716
00:58:19,375 --> 00:58:22,015
Was he in the spy game as well

717
00:58:22,044 --> 00:58:24,923
or did you just
fall into it yourself?

718
00:58:24,947 --> 00:58:27,621
He sold refrigeration equipment.

719
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:29,926
Believe it or not,
that was my next guess.

720
00:58:29,952 --> 00:58:33,331
Wait, is that code
for "He iced people"?

721
00:58:33,356 --> 00:58:37,031
The only icing he did
was for restaurants.

722
00:58:37,059 --> 00:58:39,335
You made it sound
like they were dead.

723
00:58:39,362 --> 00:58:41,137
They are.

724
00:58:41,164 --> 00:58:43,235
That wasn't a lie.

725
00:58:43,266 --> 00:58:45,212
You know, I never
really lied to you.

726
00:58:45,234 --> 00:58:47,976
- I just never--
- Never told me the truth.

727
00:58:49,171 --> 00:58:51,549
Don't even try it.

728
00:58:51,574 --> 00:58:54,282
Come on, please.

729
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:57,052
- I was in love with you.
- Please, Wes,

730
00:58:57,079 --> 00:58:59,491
just try to understand.

731
00:59:10,293 --> 00:59:12,432
So how have you been,

732
00:59:12,461 --> 00:59:15,533
asides from being
a thief and a liar?

733
00:59:15,565 --> 00:59:17,567
- I don't like your tone.
- You don't like my tone?

734
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,604
Oh, I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse me.
I'm not used to having conversations

735
00:59:20,636 --> 00:59:23,048
- with my dead fiancée every day.
- Are you done?

736
00:59:23,072 --> 00:59:25,712
I'm not-- I'm just getting started.
Do you understand

737
00:59:25,741 --> 00:59:27,982
you just killed
another human being?

738
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:31,082
- It's not the first time.
- Jesus Christ!

739
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:36,428
- You know, I went to the bridge--
- You were followed.

740
00:59:36,452 --> 00:59:39,399
- Followed?
- Where's the girl?

741
00:59:39,422 --> 00:59:41,459
She's got a name, by the way.
Her name is Nicole.

742
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:44,528
- And I ditched her like you told me to.
- She's not who she pretends to be.

743
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:47,541
Oh, you've said that already.
Please. She's a nice girl.

744
00:59:47,563 --> 00:59:50,237
She's got nothing to do
with any of this.

745
00:59:50,266 --> 00:59:52,041
She'll leave you
when she gets what she wants.

746
00:59:52,068 --> 00:59:55,675
Hey, listen, honey,
not everyone is a liar like you.

747
00:59:55,705 --> 00:59:58,515
- Wes.
- 'Cause I'm-- I'm a dead man.

748
00:59:58,541 --> 01:00:01,545
Isaac knows where I live.
If he can kill me here,

749
01:00:01,577 --> 01:00:04,387
he can kill me there.
I mean, there's-- there's no escape.

750
01:00:04,413 --> 01:00:06,518
- I can protect you.
- Oh, please.

751
01:00:06,549 --> 01:00:10,520
- Look, you have to believe me.
- I can't even believe my own eyes.

752
01:00:11,521 --> 01:00:13,831
Oh, shit.

753
01:00:18,227 --> 01:00:21,071
Nicole, how's the Bureau?

754
01:00:21,097 --> 01:00:23,543
- How does it feel to be alive?
- You two know each other?

755
01:00:23,566 --> 01:00:26,103
She's been tracking me
for years.

756
01:00:26,135 --> 01:00:27,739
So, Wes, anything
you wanna tell me?

757
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:29,408
Me?
Who the hell are you?

758
01:00:29,438 --> 01:00:30,542
She's a fed.

759
01:00:30,573 --> 01:00:34,282
Wait, wait a sec. You both are in
on this? I don't believe it.

760
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:37,416
- I told you. She wants the diamonds.
- No, we want the list.

761
01:00:37,446 --> 01:00:40,620
I've cared about 2 women in my life
and they've both lied to me.

762
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:44,257
Not little white lies, but big,
huge get-me-killed kind of lies.

763
01:00:44,286 --> 01:00:46,288
I have to go.

764
01:00:48,591 --> 01:00:51,504
Come on, girls. Girls!

765
01:00:52,027 --> 01:00:54,440
Oh, nice!

766
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:00,772
Ladies, please.

767
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:15,856
Leave him alone.

768
01:01:15,885 --> 01:01:18,195
That was my pint!

769
01:01:20,623 --> 01:01:22,261
Oh, Jesus Christ.

770
01:01:33,803 --> 01:01:36,477
Crazy fricking women.

771
01:01:36,506 --> 01:01:38,782
Taxi! Hey, taxi!

772
01:01:40,576 --> 01:01:42,146
Oh, come on.

773
01:01:42,178 --> 01:01:43,885
Oh, come on, what the hell?

774
01:01:47,383 --> 01:01:49,488
Hey, that's my beer.

775
01:01:50,753 --> 01:01:52,892
Guys, come on.
Listen, listen.

776
01:01:52,922 --> 01:01:56,870
I have had it with this.
I cannot-- come on.

777
01:01:56,892 --> 01:01:58,894
Hey, please don't put me
in this trunk.

778
01:01:58,928 --> 01:02:00,805
Please. Come on.
I'm claustrophobic.

779
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:02,810
I don't care what kind
of disease you have.

780
01:02:02,832 --> 01:02:06,405
You son of a--
help me, please. Help me, please.

781
01:02:06,435 --> 01:02:10,050
Oh, God. Oh, God.

782
01:02:10,873 --> 01:02:14,878
Help! Come on!
Let me the hell out of here!

783
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:18,289
Oh, God.

784
01:02:27,523 --> 01:02:29,298
Wes, let's go.

785
01:02:29,325 --> 01:02:30,802
Wes?

786
01:02:31,227 --> 01:02:33,537
- Come on, girlie.
- Hey, hey!

787
01:02:33,563 --> 01:02:35,440
Where are you going?

788
01:02:52,548 --> 01:02:54,653
Hello? Hello?!

789
01:02:54,684 --> 01:02:57,631
- Where are you?
- Sam. Sam! Sam!

790
01:02:57,653 --> 01:02:59,792
I'm in the truck of a car!

791
01:02:59,822 --> 01:03:02,803
- Well, what are you doing there?
- Oh, this is my thing.

792
01:03:02,825 --> 01:03:04,771
It's what I do.
I'm just relaxing.

793
01:03:04,794 --> 01:03:07,934
- Where are they taking you?
- They failed to mention that

794
01:03:07,963 --> 01:03:10,842
- before they threw me in here.
- This is very, very bad.

795
01:03:10,866 --> 01:03:12,971
I don't even understand.
Why did you even leave?

796
01:03:13,002 --> 01:03:16,848
- Because you're both insane!
- Nice. That's very funny,

797
01:03:16,872 --> 01:03:19,580
very cute.

798
01:03:19,608 --> 01:03:22,987
Oh, God, I'm a dead man.
I'm a dead man!

799
01:03:24,847 --> 01:03:26,849
Okay. Well, just relax.

800
01:03:26,882 --> 01:03:29,362
Do you have any idea
where you are?

801
01:03:29,385 --> 01:03:32,298
I don't know, I hear traffic.

802
01:03:32,321 --> 01:03:34,494
- What happened? Are you okay?
- We just hit a bump.

803
01:03:34,523 --> 01:03:38,630
Major pothole.
Drive a little safer, would you?

804
01:03:38,661 --> 01:03:40,334
- Jackass!
- Shut up!

805
01:03:40,363 --> 01:03:42,502
You almost gave me
a heart attack.

806
01:03:42,531 --> 01:03:45,842
Oh, wow. Jesus,
I'm so sorry to hear that.

807
01:03:45,868 --> 01:03:48,781
The guy drives like a lunatic.

808
01:03:48,804 --> 01:03:51,250
You have no idea
what I've been through.

809
01:03:51,274 --> 01:03:53,982
Are you actually gonna
guilt-trip me right now?

810
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:57,480
Wes, if I hadn't died that night,
we would both be dead right now.

811
01:03:57,513 --> 01:04:00,289
Oh, what? So you're gonna say
you did all this shit for me?

812
01:04:00,316 --> 01:04:03,297
- Thanks a lot.
- No. Don't you get it?

813
01:04:03,319 --> 01:04:05,321
I stayed dead
for the both of us.

814
01:04:05,354 --> 01:04:07,595
Hey, hey, while we're at it,

815
01:04:07,623 --> 01:04:10,866
one question:
"Why were you even with me?"

816
01:04:11,293 --> 01:04:13,601
I had enough of your bullshit.

817
01:04:13,629 --> 01:04:15,836
Huh? God!

818
01:04:15,864 --> 01:04:20,006
I felt normal
when I was with you.

819
01:04:20,035 --> 01:04:21,912
You know, I--

820
01:04:21,937 --> 01:04:24,918
I never had to pretend.
I could just be myself.

821
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:27,853
Oh, Christ,
I don't have any bars!

822
01:04:27,877 --> 01:04:30,790
Wes, say something.

823
01:04:31,847 --> 01:04:33,656
Wes?!

824
01:04:36,986 --> 01:04:39,398
Damn it!

825
01:04:44,493 --> 01:04:46,734
Come on, let me out of here!

826
01:04:46,762 --> 01:04:48,935
- I said shut the fuck up!
- Damn it!

827
01:04:50,899 --> 01:04:52,901
My book!

828
01:04:54,103 --> 01:04:56,640
Son of a bitch has no respect.

829
01:05:23,799 --> 01:05:25,779
Come on, Wes!

830
01:05:28,771 --> 01:05:30,808
God, where are you?

831
01:05:32,808 --> 01:05:34,913
Shit.

832
01:05:36,845 --> 01:05:38,847
Where are you?

833
01:05:54,497 --> 01:05:56,101
Oh, God.

834
01:05:56,131 --> 01:05:58,975
- Which ear, the right or the left?
- Please. You don't have to do this.

835
01:05:59,001 --> 01:06:01,709
I won't tell anybody
about you guys' existence. I swear.

836
01:06:01,737 --> 01:06:05,685
Did she honestly think there was
anywhere on this entire planet

837
01:06:05,708 --> 01:06:08,882
- that she could hide from me?
- You seem like nice fellas. Come on.

838
01:06:08,911 --> 01:06:10,857
- Kill him.
- No, no, no, wait, wait.

839
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:12,791
- No ear?
- No. Listen, listen.

840
01:06:12,815 --> 01:06:15,557
I'll put in my next book.
How does that sound?

841
01:06:15,584 --> 01:06:19,498
Like having my balls licked
by a porcupine.

842
01:06:19,521 --> 01:06:21,398
Kill him.

843
01:06:21,423 --> 01:06:23,528
You kill me, you get nothing.

844
01:06:26,795 --> 01:06:29,105
Can I get that?

845
01:06:30,466 --> 01:06:32,845
I know that hurt.

846
01:06:33,869 --> 01:06:35,644
Wes?

847
01:06:35,671 --> 01:06:38,083
No, Alicia.
Or is it Sam?

848
01:06:38,107 --> 01:06:40,815
Let me talk to Wes!

849
01:06:40,843 --> 01:06:44,450
I know my diamonds are nearby.
Shall we go get them?

850
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:48,622
- And no, that is not a question.
- I need him to get the package.

851
01:06:49,885 --> 01:06:53,833
So many problems and distractions.

852
01:06:53,856 --> 01:06:57,030
Okay. Come to the corner
of Washington and First.

853
01:06:57,059 --> 01:06:59,835
And please don't make me
hurt him.

854
01:06:59,862 --> 01:07:01,906
I swear to God, Isa--

855
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,946
God damn it!

856
01:07:28,657 --> 01:07:32,571
Hello?! I'm actually
quite good in here now.

857
01:07:32,594 --> 01:07:34,540
Very comfortable, quite cozy.

858
01:07:34,563 --> 01:07:37,601
I said shut the fuck up!

859
01:07:57,519 --> 01:07:59,999
You've been
a very naughty girl, Alicia.

860
01:08:00,022 --> 01:08:02,024
Where's Wes?

861
01:08:02,057 --> 01:08:04,059
What? No kiss?

862
01:08:12,668 --> 01:08:15,615
What? Come on, come on!

863
01:08:15,638 --> 01:08:19,176
- Let me out of here, you--
- Wes, we're gonna get you out.

864
01:08:19,208 --> 01:08:22,587
- He has to go in alone.
- Is that you, Sam?

865
01:08:22,611 --> 01:08:24,989
Get me the hell out of here.

866
01:08:28,817 --> 01:08:32,128
Hi, honey. There's some good stuff
in here. You should read it.

867
01:08:35,557 --> 01:08:37,559
All right, what the hell is going on?

868
01:08:37,593 --> 01:08:41,006
- Sweetie, you have to go in the bank.
- Another bank?

869
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:42,805
What am I supposed
to do in there now?

870
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:45,107
Look, everything you need
is inside.

871
01:08:49,772 --> 01:08:52,946
Don't be a hero, Mr. Wilson,

872
01:08:52,975 --> 01:08:57,583
or I'll put 2 more holes in her,
and I don't mean the good kind.

873
01:08:57,613 --> 01:09:00,822
I can't believe I signed
a book for this guy.

874
01:09:01,884 --> 01:09:04,160
Stay close, sweetheart.

875
01:09:12,594 --> 01:09:15,598
This is unbelievable.

876
01:09:16,699 --> 01:09:19,145
Oh, okay.

877
01:09:22,805 --> 01:09:24,614
Good morning, sir.

878
01:09:25,741 --> 01:09:28,221
Hi. I need to get in
to the safety deposit box.

879
01:09:28,243 --> 01:09:31,087
- Passport.
- Right. Of course.

880
01:09:31,113 --> 01:09:33,218
My fiancée, she passed away.

881
01:09:34,148 --> 01:09:37,162
She died, yep.
Rest in peace.

882
01:09:37,186 --> 01:09:39,962
Put your right hand
on the screen, please.

883
01:09:39,989 --> 01:09:41,627
Right.

884
01:09:43,625 --> 01:09:44,966
High tech.

885
01:09:50,266 --> 01:09:52,268
- Your key.
- Thank you.

886
01:09:52,301 --> 01:09:54,406
You're welcome. This way.

887
01:10:16,291 --> 01:10:18,032
Jackass.

888
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:50,861
"Dearest, I will make
this up to you in ways

889
01:10:50,893 --> 01:10:53,874
you cannot even begin to imagine.
I always knew I loved you.

890
01:10:53,896 --> 01:10:56,240
And this time I promise
never to let go.

891
01:10:56,264 --> 01:10:59,245
Most importantly, my love,
please walk out the back door."

892
01:11:25,961 --> 01:11:30,307
Sir? Sir? You can't go
that way. Sir.

893
01:11:32,299 --> 01:11:33,973
Shit!

894
01:11:40,108 --> 01:11:42,315
There he goes.

895
01:11:45,347 --> 01:11:48,260
Open the door.
Get out of the car!

896
01:11:48,683 --> 01:11:50,422
What the fuck, you son of a--

897
01:11:50,452 --> 01:11:53,456
No, no, no, you simple bastard.
Go after him!

898
01:11:53,488 --> 01:11:55,729
Bring me my diamonds!

899
01:11:55,757 --> 01:11:58,465
I haven't shot anyone
in a long time.

900
01:12:09,037 --> 01:12:10,539
Wes, what are you doing?

901
01:13:18,206 --> 01:13:20,015
- God!
- Hey!

902
01:13:20,042 --> 01:13:22,147
- What are you doing?
- Hey, come back here!

903
01:13:33,121 --> 01:13:35,123
Yeah!

904
01:14:24,306 --> 01:14:27,014
Let's go.
Come on! Come on!

905
01:15:00,207 --> 01:15:02,586
Aye aye.

906
01:15:17,993 --> 01:15:20,371
Come on!

907
01:15:24,566 --> 01:15:27,069
Come on!

908
01:15:39,147 --> 01:15:40,626
Holy shit.

909
01:15:40,649 --> 01:15:43,459
Sam, what the hell
are we doing?

910
01:15:43,485 --> 01:15:47,160
Oh my God.

911
01:15:58,366 --> 01:16:00,676
- Where's the list?
- What list?

912
01:16:00,702 --> 01:16:03,080
I was hired to get
a list of Isaac's clients.

913
01:16:03,105 --> 01:16:06,052
What clients?
Who are you people?

914
01:16:06,074 --> 01:16:09,112
I can't leave empty-handed.

915
01:16:09,144 --> 01:16:11,647
- Sorry, babe.
- So now you're gonna shoot me.

916
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:14,684
I don't believe it. Here, look.
See it for yourself. There is no list.

917
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:25,260
- Wes, grab the case.
- Thank God.

918
01:16:25,293 --> 01:16:28,604
- Give me that.
- Here.

919
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:32,100
- So you don't go away empty-handed.
- The list?

920
01:16:32,134 --> 01:16:34,410
Names, numbers--
it's all there.

921
01:16:34,436 --> 01:16:37,110
I never did those things
your people said I did.

922
01:16:37,138 --> 01:16:39,709
I was the thief. Once I figured out
what else was going on,

923
01:16:39,741 --> 01:16:41,584
that's when I tried to get out.

924
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:43,790
I'll pass that along.

925
01:16:49,618 --> 01:16:51,655
Get down here.

926
01:16:51,686 --> 01:16:53,529
I'll cover you guys. Go!

927
01:16:57,058 --> 01:16:59,060
Let's go.

928
01:17:02,631 --> 01:17:04,577
Go!

929
01:17:25,453 --> 01:17:27,797
Ah, see there?
There's Nicole. Stop the car.

930
01:17:27,822 --> 01:17:30,359
Come on, you gotta pick her up.
She gave us cover.

931
01:17:30,392 --> 01:17:32,167
- Stop the car!
- Okay, fine.

932
01:17:32,193 --> 01:17:34,195
You can't just leave her
out here.

933
01:17:36,531 --> 01:17:38,408
Thanks.

934
01:17:38,433 --> 01:17:42,848
All right, we're all together.
Let's go. Go, go, go!

935
01:17:42,871 --> 01:17:45,511
Thank you, Nicole,
for the cover there.

936
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:48,350
Look, why don't you drop me off
on the next corner here?

937
01:17:48,376 --> 01:17:51,186
I can go for a latte
and a deep-tissue.

938
01:17:51,212 --> 01:17:52,589
Shut up, Wes!

939
01:17:52,614 --> 01:17:55,595
Sweetness just keeps pouring
right out of you, you know that?

940
01:17:55,617 --> 01:17:57,528
He's right behind us!

941
01:17:57,552 --> 01:17:59,657
- Check the glove box.
- Perfect.

942
01:17:59,688 --> 01:18:01,760
Hold on!

943
01:18:04,893 --> 01:18:07,737
Jesus, she's crazy!

944
01:18:13,735 --> 01:18:16,147
I'm gonna be sick!

945
01:18:16,171 --> 01:18:17,616
God, no!

946
01:18:21,543 --> 01:18:23,750
Whoa! Hey!
Watch it!

947
01:18:23,778 --> 01:18:25,058
Hold on!

948
01:18:34,823 --> 01:18:36,632
I think we've lost him.

949
01:18:50,539 --> 01:18:53,520
Just do me a favor.
What do they say in mob terms?

950
01:18:53,541 --> 01:18:55,680
- Just take me out.
- That would be getting whacked.

951
01:18:55,710 --> 01:18:59,522
- Whacked, wiped-out, whatever.
- Look, just tell me one thing,

952
01:18:59,547 --> 01:19:02,255
- are you in love with her?
- Love is a beautiful thing.

953
01:19:02,284 --> 01:19:05,390
People meet. They fall in love.
They have normal relationships.

954
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:07,400
- She's using you.
- Just sit back there

955
01:19:07,422 --> 01:19:09,163
- and enjoy the ride, missy.
- Girls, girls,

956
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:12,569
didn't you learn anything
from my book?

957
01:19:12,594 --> 01:19:17,270
Chapter 7: "Communication Is
the Key to Any Successful Relationship."

958
01:19:18,934 --> 01:19:20,641
- Jesus!
- Get down!

959
01:19:20,668 --> 01:19:22,648
I'm gonna kill
these sons of bitches!

960
01:19:28,510 --> 01:19:30,786
Look out!

961
01:19:34,482 --> 01:19:36,359
I don't care anymore!

962
01:19:36,384 --> 01:19:37,863
Cut them off!

963
01:19:37,886 --> 01:19:40,332
Do it!

964
01:19:41,489 --> 01:19:43,935
- What are you doing?
- I'm going in the park.

965
01:19:43,958 --> 01:19:47,235
What!
Don't go in the park!

966
01:19:47,262 --> 01:19:49,572
Stay on them!

967
01:19:49,597 --> 01:19:52,271
To the bridge.

968
01:19:53,468 --> 01:19:56,449
There's pedestrians everywhere.
You're gonna kill somebody.

969
01:19:56,471 --> 01:19:59,315
You know what?
Just a little support would be nice.

970
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:02,287
You know what?
I don't like anything you do-- nothing.

971
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:05,587
Nothing! Shit!

972
01:20:17,592 --> 01:20:19,572
You got 'em!
You got 'em!

973
01:20:22,263 --> 01:20:24,337
Get down!

974
01:20:25,433 --> 01:20:29,643
Shoot him! Shoot him!

975
01:20:29,671 --> 01:20:32,447
I think you lost 'em!
Nice driving.

976
01:20:32,474 --> 01:20:33,578
Fuck you!

977
01:20:41,515 --> 01:20:43,728
Nice work, honey!

978
01:20:56,298 --> 01:20:57,878
Oh, Jesus.

979
01:20:58,299 --> 01:21:00,438
We gotta get out!

980
01:21:03,438 --> 01:21:04,644
Shit.

981
01:21:06,874 --> 01:21:08,815
I'm alive!

982
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:15,359
Wes, help me.

983
01:21:21,522 --> 01:21:23,502
- Come on, honey.
- The case.

984
01:21:23,525 --> 01:21:25,436
Just leave it.

985
01:21:28,563 --> 01:21:30,804
Oh, come on! Nicole!

986
01:21:30,832 --> 01:21:32,402
I'm a big girl. Just go.

987
01:21:36,471 --> 01:21:38,781
Up this hill, come on!

988
01:21:38,807 --> 01:21:41,413
Get back. What are you doing.
Come on, let's go.

989
01:21:41,542 --> 01:21:42,921
- Come on!

990
01:21:42,944 --> 01:21:45,584
They're getting away!

991
01:21:53,788 --> 01:21:56,428
Up here.

992
01:22:00,128 --> 01:22:02,904
Get through there.
Come on.

993
01:22:02,931 --> 01:22:05,434
Shit, he's coming.

994
01:22:10,605 --> 01:22:12,184
Come on!

995
01:22:18,312 --> 01:22:20,390
Go go go!

996
01:22:20,415 --> 01:22:21,917
Oh God.

997
01:22:23,918 --> 01:22:25,955
Shit!

998
01:22:25,987 --> 01:22:27,694
Come on, let's go!

999
01:22:29,424 --> 01:22:30,628
Wes!

1000
01:22:32,126 --> 01:22:34,629
Ah! I'm shot!

1001
01:22:34,662 --> 01:22:37,836
- Oh, God!
- Drop it!

1002
01:22:37,866 --> 01:22:40,608
I'll finish him.

1003
01:22:40,635 --> 01:22:43,411
- Drop it.
- It stings.

1004
01:22:43,838 --> 01:22:45,145
God!

1005
01:22:45,173 --> 01:22:47,173
God!

1006
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:54,893
- Wes?
- God.

1007
01:22:54,916 --> 01:22:57,419
Somebody get an ambulance!

1008
01:22:57,452 --> 01:23:01,025
We need help!
Call an ambulance!

1009
01:23:05,126 --> 01:23:08,539
- Somebody help!
- God! The pain!

1010
01:23:08,563 --> 01:23:10,702
Apply pressure.
Apply pressure.

1011
01:23:10,732 --> 01:23:12,973
- Right here.
- I got it, I got it, I got it.

1012
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,776
- Oh, guys!
- Okay. You're okay.

1013
01:23:18,072 --> 01:23:20,143
You're okay.
Just relax. Just relax, Wes.

1014
01:23:20,174 --> 01:23:23,986
Don't get up. Don't get up.

1015
01:23:24,012 --> 01:23:26,891
I've never seen my own blood.
It's too much!

1016
01:23:26,914 --> 01:23:30,862
- Where is she going? Oh my God! Jesus!
- Just relax. You're okay.

1017
01:23:30,885 --> 01:23:32,455
You're okay. You're okay.

1018
01:23:34,489 --> 01:23:37,629
- You're okay, Wes.
- The pain!

1019
01:23:37,659 --> 01:23:39,730
- It's fine, okay.
- Jesus.

1020
01:23:39,761 --> 01:23:43,436
I'm passing out,
I can feel it.

1021
01:24:27,108 --> 01:24:29,952
Nice to see you again, Isaac.

1022
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:35,886
Seat belts must remain fastened

1023
01:24:35,917 --> 01:24:39,023
until we reach
our cruising altitude.

1024
01:24:42,757 --> 01:24:45,966
I had a dream once
and you took that from me.

1025
01:24:45,994 --> 01:24:49,134
So now I'm gonna take all of yours.

1026
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:09,291
Hope you took
your flying lessons.

1027
01:25:09,317 --> 01:25:10,728
You wonderful little--

1028
01:25:23,564 --> 01:25:26,044
<i>Pull up, pull up!</i>

1029
01:25:29,670 --> 01:25:32,310
<i>Terrain coming.</i>

1030
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:34,183
<i>Pull up, pull up.</i>

1031
01:25:38,079 --> 01:25:40,753
So in the end
Isaac's plane crashes

1032
01:25:40,781 --> 01:25:44,593
- and Sam parachutes to safety.
- Okay.

1033
01:25:44,619 --> 01:25:47,065
So Sam is still alive
leading a double life.

1034
01:25:49,088 --> 01:25:51,195
This is good stuff.

1035
01:25:51,226 --> 01:25:53,103
All right, check this out, man.

1036
01:25:53,127 --> 01:25:57,041
"She stole millions of dollars worth
of gems from a relentless madman.

1037
01:25:57,064 --> 01:26:00,944
Now he will hunt her to the ends of
the earth and beyond to get them back."

1038
01:26:00,968 --> 01:26:03,141
This is good.
You know what we should do?

1039
01:26:03,171 --> 01:26:05,583
Let's change Spokane to Paris.

1040
01:26:05,606 --> 01:26:07,347
I think it's much better.

1041
01:26:07,375 --> 01:26:09,651
I don't know, Marty.

1042
01:26:09,677 --> 01:26:12,715
Real life can be pretty
damn exciting sometimes.

1043
01:26:14,649 --> 01:26:16,686
Is this about the check?
Where are you going?

1044
01:26:32,867 --> 01:26:34,642
Excuse me.

1045
01:26:34,669 --> 01:26:37,878
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought
you were somebody else.

1046
01:26:50,084 --> 01:26:54,191
<i>* I know in my heart</i>

1047
01:26:54,222 --> 01:26:58,671
<i>* I can make it all
up to you</i>

1048
01:26:58,693 --> 01:27:01,173
<i>* This feeling of love
doesn't know</i>

1049
01:27:01,195 --> 01:27:03,072
<i>* If it has a chance
to grow</i>

1050
01:27:03,097 --> 01:27:05,099
<i>* Time will tell what you do...</i>

1051
01:27:05,132 --> 01:27:07,009
I'm Sam.

1052
01:27:07,035 --> 01:27:08,412
I'm a spy.

1053
01:27:08,436 --> 01:27:10,347
No kidding.

1054
01:27:10,371 --> 01:27:12,681
Is there anything
I could say

1055
01:27:12,707 --> 01:27:15,244
that could get you
back to my place?

1056
01:27:15,276 --> 01:27:18,052
- No.
- Why not?

1057
01:27:18,079 --> 01:27:21,686
Because you're just a spy.

1058
01:27:21,716 --> 01:27:24,060
You know,
I'm not really just a writer.

1059
01:27:24,085 --> 01:27:26,087
No?

1060
01:27:27,989 --> 01:27:29,730
Isaac was right.

1061
01:27:29,757 --> 01:27:33,034
Diamonds truly are
a girl's best friend.

1062
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:39,900
Subtitles: Arigon

1063
01:28:15,770 --> 01:28:18,979
I couldn't help but overhear
you guys talking.

1064
01:28:19,006 --> 01:28:21,247
- I understand you're an agent?
- That's right.

1065
01:28:21,275 --> 01:28:23,755
I got this idea for a book.

1066
01:28:23,778 --> 01:28:27,248
It's a cookbook with recipes
for couples in trouble.

1067
01:28:27,281 --> 01:28:29,761
- Who else knows about this?
- Nobody.

1068
01:28:29,784 --> 01:28:34,096
Well, a few, but they're
not around anymore.

1069
01:28:34,122 --> 01:28:36,830
Let's keep it that way.
Martin Rivera.

1070
01:28:36,858 --> 01:28:39,031
Nice to meet ya.
