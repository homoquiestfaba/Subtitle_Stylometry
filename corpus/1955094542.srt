1
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,400
I was a liar

2
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,400
I gave into the fire

3
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,700
I know I should've fought it

4
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,700
At least I'm being honest

5
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,700
Feel like a failure

6
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,700
'Cause I know that I failed you

7
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,700
I should've done you better

8
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,200
'Cause you don't want
a liar (come on)

9
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,700
And I know, and I
know, and I know

10
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,700
She gives you everything but,
boy, I couldn't give it to you

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,500
And I know, and I
know, and I know

12
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,800
That you got everything

13
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,000
But I got nothing
here without you

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,500
<font color="#ff00ff">So one last time</font>

15
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,600
I need to be the one
who takes you home

16
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,200
One more time

17
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,800
I promise after that,
I'll let you go

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,900
Baby, I don't care if you
got her in your heart

19
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,900
All I really care is
you wake up in my arms

20
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,400
<font color="#ff00ff">One last time</font>

21
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,500
I need to be the one
who takes you home

22
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,300
I don't deserve it

23
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,000
I know I don't deserve it

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But stay with me a minute

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I swear I'll make it worth it

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,700
Can't you forgive me?

27
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,700
At least just temporarily

28
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,700
I know that this is my fault

29
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,500
I should've been more
careful (come on)

30
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,800
And I know, and I
know, and I know

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,800
She gives you everything but,
boy, I couldn't give it to you

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,900
And I know, and I
know, and I know

33
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,200
That you got everything

34
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,200
But I got nothing here
without you, baby

35
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,500
<font color="#ff00ff">So one last time</font>

36
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,300

I promise after that,
I'll let you go

39
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,300
Baby, I don't care if you
got her in your heart

40
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,300
