1
00:01:49,626 --> 00:01:51,116
Ten-hut!

2
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,378
Welcome home, Mr. President.

3
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,717
Over here, Mr. President!

4
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,556
Good to be home.

5
00:02:38,508 --> 00:02:41,102
-What do you got?
-Let's go over it again.

6
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:43,604
Who do I see first this morning?

7
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,737
You've got Mr. Crenshaw at 1 1 :30.

8
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:48,841
I can't do two things at once.
I got NSC at 2:30.

9
00:02:49,018 --> 00:02:51,248
-That'll only take half an hour.
-With Syria?

10
00:02:51,354 --> 00:02:53,117
You have the radio address...

11
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,748
...and the Legal Counsel speech
at the Monroe tomorrow.

12
00:02:57,493 --> 00:02:58,357
The Monroe?

13
00:02:58,461 --> 00:03:00,190
Welcome home, Mr. President.

14
00:03:00,363 --> 00:03:02,194
Yes, sir, the Monroe Hotel.

15
00:03:02,365 --> 00:03:04,196
Have you got a double for me?

16
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:06,426
-We're working on it.
-Good.

17
00:03:08,571 --> 00:03:10,937
Try to find someone
who looks like me this time.

18
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,937
That last guy was a joke.

19
00:03:16,246 --> 00:03:18,942
Ladies and gentlemen, here he is...

20
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:21,513
...the President of the United States.

21
00:03:34,664 --> 00:03:36,655
God bless you. Thank you.

22
00:03:37,066 --> 00:03:39,557
Welcome to Durenberger's, Mr. President.

23
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:41,563
Thank you, one and all.

24
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:45,033
Let me just say,
from one chief executive to another...

25
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:50,410
...that there is no Chevrolet
like Durenberger's Community Chevrolet.

26
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,743
Thank you, Mr. President.

27
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,816
That's not the president, is it?

28
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,246
I sure hope not.

29
00:03:56,352 --> 00:04:01,585
I have the feeling that when people
find out about the $500 cash rebate...

30
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,793
...on all Geo Storms
and Geo Storm convertibles...

31
00:04:04,894 --> 00:04:06,919
...that you'll be even busier than I am.

32
00:04:07,096 --> 00:04:08,927
You said it, Mr. President.

33
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:13,926
I could veto this Simpson-Gardner thing
if I wanted to, but I don't.

34
00:04:14,237 --> 00:04:15,795
Do you know why?

35
00:04:17,273 --> 00:04:19,104
It's got homeless shelters...

36
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,139
...and Head Start centers...

37
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,603
...and....

38
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:24,210
Hot lunches.

39
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,212
Hot lunches for little kiddies.

40
00:04:27,617 --> 00:04:30,279
If I kill it, I'm going to look like a prick.

41
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,216
I don't want to look like a prick.

42
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,615
I want you to look like pricks.

43
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,524
But, sir, we tried to kill it.

44
00:04:39,896 --> 00:04:40,863
Twice.

45
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,263
I don't think so. If you killed it,
it would be dead.

46
00:04:45,068 --> 00:04:46,626
When I kill something...

47
00:04:47,136 --> 00:04:48,694
...it always dies.

48
00:04:49,105 --> 00:04:50,970
-Doesn't it, Bob?
-Always did.

49
00:04:52,408 --> 00:04:55,400
Mr. President, with all the work
your wife does with the homeless--

50
00:04:55,478 --> 00:04:56,467
My wife.

51
00:04:58,748 --> 00:05:01,717
I don't want you to do this
because you're forced to.

52
00:05:02,251 --> 00:05:04,651
I want you to do this because you want to.

53
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,581
I want you to do it
because it's the right thing to do.

54
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:12,818
Do it because you're acting
in the best interests of your country.

55
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,433
Well, I think that's it.

56
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:32,906
6:30?

57
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,782
-Perfect.
-Great. I'll see you then.

58
00:05:36,686 --> 00:05:38,586
How are you? Having fun?

59
00:05:38,788 --> 00:05:40,517
Good to see you.

60
00:05:41,524 --> 00:05:42,718
Ask me how I did.

61
00:05:42,892 --> 00:05:45,190
-How'd it go?
-I killed them. It was great.

62
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,593
-See what you can do in here.
-Okay, what's up?

63
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,959
How are you, Mabel? Hi, Jennifer.

64
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:53,628
Mabel says it's too far.
Jennifer's boss tried to hit on her.

65
00:05:53,803 --> 00:05:56,863
Lola's been in your office crying
for almost an hour.

66
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,302
What happened?

67
00:05:58,374 --> 00:06:01,537
It's not my fault. I learn on the IBM, okay?

68
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:03,542
Then they put me on the Wang.

69
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:08,950
Don't worry. We'll think of something.

70
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:11,619
So tonight's the big night.

71
00:06:11,988 --> 00:06:14,149
It's some secret. He won't tell me.

72
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,857
It'll be fine. We'll fix it.

73
00:06:18,928 --> 00:06:21,897
Honey, call Murray.
Tell him we're on our way, okay?

74
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:24,458
It's Wednesday. Everybody works.

75
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,499
Can I borrow your-- Thanks.

76
00:06:30,573 --> 00:06:33,133
I can't hire anybody else. I can't.

77
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:35,468
She flies on an IBM.

78
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:39,012
I don't have enough work
for the people you already gave me.

79
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,246
She's got three kids.
Her husband's a diabetic.

80
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,422
Just a short-term thing. Temp job.

81
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:50,918
Please?

82
00:06:53,763 --> 00:06:55,492
I'll see what I can do.

83
00:06:58,768 --> 00:07:00,099
Thanks.

84
00:07:01,938 --> 00:07:03,633
You feel okay about this?

85
00:07:03,873 --> 00:07:05,170
Not yet.

86
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:06,669
You will.

87
00:07:07,276 --> 00:07:09,210
Do you want to go play some ball?

88
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:12,178
It's the middle of the day. I'm working.

89
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:15,106
Me, too. Okay, well, thanks.

90
00:07:15,318 --> 00:07:16,342
See you tomorrow.

91
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:19,513
'Bye, Lola, Kate, Adriana, Pam.

92
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,887
''And the waving wheat
Can sure smell sweet

93
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:28,463

104
00:08:14,377 --> 00:08:15,742
Mr. Kovic?

105
00:08:18,514 --> 00:08:21,847
I'm Duane Stevenson
with the United States Secret Service.

106
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,246
We're with the federal government.

107
00:08:26,989 --> 00:08:29,480
I swear I thought that was
a legitimate deduction....

108
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:32,050
I do impersonations,
so I use that TV for my work.

109
00:08:32,128 --> 00:08:34,790
Mr. Kovic,
we're not here about your taxes.

110
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:42,700
On occasion, for security purposes,
we hire a double for the president...

111
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,699
...at public functions
in exposed situations.

112
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,535
Your government needs your help.

113
00:08:52,715 --> 00:08:53,977
Really?

114
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:02,853
I like it.

115
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:04,693
You look just like him.

116
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:05,852
You think?

117
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:07,852
And the coloring....

118
00:09:08,364 --> 00:09:09,922
Coloring is excellent.

119
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:12,693
-His hair's this short?
-It's a perfect match.

120
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,064
Not over the ears?

121
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,865
You understand what you'll be doing?

122
00:09:15,938 --> 00:09:17,200
You want me to wave.

123
00:09:17,273 --> 00:09:20,868
Wave from the door,
come downstairs, get into the limo.

124
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,804
You know, if you want me
to do other stuff, I can.

125
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:25,870
-lf you want me to talk--
-Don't say a word.

126
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:26,937
Right.

127
00:09:28,718 --> 00:09:32,620
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

128
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:58,571
Thank you all.

129
00:10:02,251 --> 00:10:04,219
Is there a lawyer in the house?

130
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:06,981
You know...

131
00:10:07,156 --> 00:10:10,887
...as I came to the podium,
I saw my friend, Jordan Blankfort.

132
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:15,088
Now Justice Blankfort...

133
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:20,091
...who I haven't seen
since our law school days at Yale....

134
00:10:21,003 --> 00:10:23,665
You know, just seeing him makes me...

135
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,434
...kind of nostalgic
for those innocent days back then.

136
00:10:28,277 --> 00:10:31,838
The worst thing we did was hoist
a guy's underwear up a flagpole.

137
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:37,675
<i>We need standardized parole criteria...</i>

138
00:10:37,987 --> 00:10:42,481
<i>...that will guarantee a prisoner</i>
<i>will not be returned to the street...</i>

139
00:10:42,591 --> 00:10:46,186
<i>...until he has paid his debt to society.</i>

140
00:10:49,865 --> 00:10:53,130
<i>We need a judiciary</i>
<i>that is sensitive to the needs...</i>

141
00:10:53,302 --> 00:10:54,360
Let's go.

142
00:10:54,537 --> 00:10:59,907
<i>...of the average American,</i>
<i>because that's what we're founded on.</i>

143
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:04,307
<i>The dreams...</i>

144
00:11:04,714 --> 00:11:06,306
<i>...the dreams of a few...</i>

145
00:11:06,382 --> 00:11:08,373
...struggling pilgrims...

146
00:11:08,651 --> 00:11:11,017
...who imagined a system of laws...

147
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,212
...of the people, by the people...

148
00:11:14,557 --> 00:11:19,290
...and for all the decent people
of this land! God bless you!

149
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,392
God bless America!

150
00:11:52,595 --> 00:11:54,222
Let's move it up a half hour.

151
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:57,265
You have the trade negotiations.
It needs to be handled.

152
00:12:05,107 --> 00:12:06,199
He's here.

153
00:12:07,943 --> 00:12:09,877
They weren't enthusiastic.

154
00:12:10,045 --> 00:12:11,740
Of course, they're lawyers.

155
00:12:17,386 --> 00:12:18,978
Jesus Christ!

156
00:12:49,985 --> 00:12:51,748
You're a very handsome man.

157
00:12:51,921 --> 00:12:53,479
Thank you, Mr. President.

158
00:12:54,056 --> 00:12:56,650
Just get rid of the grin.
You look like a schmuck.

159
00:12:59,595 --> 00:13:00,619
He's all right.

160
00:13:03,165 --> 00:13:04,257
Wish me luck.

161
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,829
Call me if there's a war.

162
00:13:09,772 --> 00:13:11,103
Move him out.

163
00:13:16,445 --> 00:13:17,434
You're on.

164
00:13:56,385 --> 00:13:57,977
Okay, you ready?

165
00:14:31,086 --> 00:14:32,678
Mr. President?

166
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,853
President Mitchell!

167
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:47,867
God bless you! God bless America!

168
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:57,769
Thank you very much!

169
00:15:13,262 --> 00:15:16,390
I'm sorry. I just couldn't help it.
I got carried away.

170
00:15:16,732 --> 00:15:18,563
I was pretty good, wasn't I?

171
00:15:23,305 --> 00:15:26,934
Something important must be going on
for the president to do this.

172
00:15:29,044 --> 00:15:30,978
Something top secret.

173
00:15:59,174 --> 00:16:00,163
Baby?

174
00:16:08,283 --> 00:16:09,272
Hon?

175
00:16:16,025 --> 00:16:17,515
Mr. President?

176
00:16:32,808 --> 00:16:36,073
Doesn't look very good.
It hit both sides of his brain.

177
00:16:36,145 --> 00:16:38,136
If he makes it, he'll be a vegetable.

178
00:16:38,213 --> 00:16:40,204
-I can't believe he'd do this.
-I know.

179
00:16:40,282 --> 00:16:42,716
-Where's the girl?
-She's upset.

180
00:16:42,785 --> 00:16:45,481
-We have her upstairs.
-Some nightmare.

181
00:16:48,323 --> 00:16:51,053
At some point we'll have to call
the vice-president.

182
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:54,152
Don't call the vice-president!

183
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,826
Don't call him.

184
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:59,490
-The guy's in a coma!
-I don't give a shit.

185
00:17:00,235 --> 00:17:02,567
This is mine, Al. It's all mine.

186
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,069
I made him. I built him.

187
00:17:06,341 --> 00:17:09,504
And no Boy Scout
is going to take it away from me...

188
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:13,079
...just because he happens to be
vice-president of the United States.

189
00:17:32,334 --> 00:17:33,494
You know...

190
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:38,705
...if you want to do something
for his birthday, I've got great stuff.

191
00:17:38,874 --> 00:17:41,240
I do this thing. My friends love it.

192
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:45,611
The president and the first lady
are going to Club Med...

193
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:47,080
...for their vacation....

194
00:17:49,685 --> 00:17:50,845
Oh, sir.

195
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:07,228
Back to the cottage.

196
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,878
We'll start by going on TV.

197
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:20,847
We'll admit he had a stroke,
but we'll say it was a mild stroke.

198
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,181
A mild stroke?

199
00:18:23,252 --> 00:18:26,415
And he ought to be up and around again
sometime soon.

200
00:18:27,422 --> 00:18:28,684
Up and around?

201
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:30,680
How?

202
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,594
You know...

203
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,524
...l'm not scared.

204
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,870
I've been cooperative.
I'd just like to know where we're going.

205
00:19:02,324 --> 00:19:04,792
I'm Alan Reed,
White House communications director.

206
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,954
This is Bob Alexander, our chief of staff.

207
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,721
We met at the hotel tonight, remember?

208
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:13,263
Can I get you a drink?

209
00:19:13,802 --> 00:19:16,032
You sure? Coke, mineral water?

210
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,800
I'm fine.

211
00:19:20,142 --> 00:19:23,737
Dave, something has come up
and I think we need to talk about it.

212
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:27,573
I'm so sorry.
I know I wasn't supposed to talk...

213
00:19:27,883 --> 00:19:30,374
...but I saw the crowd and got excited--

214
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,751
We're not upset with you.
We think you did a great job.

215
00:19:36,825 --> 00:19:37,917
Don't worry about it.

216
00:19:39,027 --> 00:19:39,789
Terrific.

217
00:19:39,862 --> 00:19:42,057
In fact you did such a good job...

218
00:19:42,364 --> 00:19:44,161
...that we'd like to...

219
00:19:44,967 --> 00:19:46,195
...extend things a little.

220
00:19:46,735 --> 00:19:47,793
Extend things?

221
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,930
Extend them.

222
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:53,834
Come here.

223
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,852
Try it out.

224
00:20:11,026 --> 00:20:12,653
-Try it out?
-Go ahead.

225
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,306
How's that feel?

226
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,637
Very nice.

227
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,542
Dave...

228
00:20:34,883 --> 00:20:38,182
...the reason we invited you here tonight
is because...

229
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,685
...something happened to the president.

230
00:20:41,523 --> 00:20:42,512
Oh, my God!

231
00:20:42,624 --> 00:20:45,422
I know, it's difficult for all of us, but...

232
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,760
...we need to put
our personal feelings aside and focus...

233
00:20:49,865 --> 00:20:51,799
...on the good of the country.

234
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:55,597
What happened?

235
00:20:56,738 --> 00:20:59,002
It's actually kind of serious, Dave.

236
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:02,741
The president's not in very good shape.

237
00:21:03,912 --> 00:21:05,243
Will he be okay?

238
00:21:06,648 --> 00:21:08,513
-Probably.
-I think so.

239
00:21:15,924 --> 00:21:17,983
Sometimes we need our friends...

240
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,421
...and even our enemies, to feel...

241
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,425
...safe and secure.

242
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,697
We need them to feel
like they can go to bed at night...

243
00:21:25,767 --> 00:21:29,362
...knowing that President Mitchell
is fully in control.

244
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:32,932
We need them to feel like...

245
00:21:33,675 --> 00:21:35,700
...he's sitting right here...

246
00:21:36,611 --> 00:21:37,942
...in this chair.

247
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,380
Wait a minute.

248
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:43,807
Wait.

249
00:21:48,991 --> 00:21:50,618
What about the vice-president?

250
00:21:50,692 --> 00:21:51,954
Vice-president?

251
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,887
We didn't want to have to tell you this...

252
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,903
...but the vice-president
is mentally unbalanced.

253
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,899
I'm afraid so.

254
00:22:09,478 --> 00:22:10,570
Really?

255
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,969
Crazy?

256
00:22:13,048 --> 00:22:14,174
Certifiable.

257
00:22:20,155 --> 00:22:22,248
How much do you usually get paid?

258
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,786
I don't know.

259
00:22:25,327 --> 00:22:26,419
Depends.

260
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,418
Usually it's a...

261
00:22:28,663 --> 00:22:30,654
...barter kind of thing.

262
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:33,934
Is this legal?

263
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:39,739
Have you ever driven through a red light?

264
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,436
You know...

265
00:22:42,544 --> 00:22:46,571
...on an empty road when there's
nobody around and you know it's safe?

266
00:22:47,249 --> 00:22:49,149
I'm not sure. I might have.

267
00:22:50,018 --> 00:22:51,451
Well, let's say...

268
00:22:51,753 --> 00:22:54,847
...let's say your mother
is in the car and you...

269
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,954
...have to get her to the hospital.

270
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:00,352
You'd do it then for sure, right?

271
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,029
Yes, I guess I would.

272
00:23:03,198 --> 00:23:04,961
Now, let's say...

273
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:07,296
...the whole country...

274
00:23:07,436 --> 00:23:08,767
...is in the car.

275
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,701
The entire United States of America.

276
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:15,305
-In the car?
-In the car.

277
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:18,035
I see what you mean.

278
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,550
Dave, the country is sick.

279
00:23:25,053 --> 00:23:27,487
And you'll get it to the hospital.

280
00:23:30,092 --> 00:23:32,060
These are the private quarters.

281
00:23:33,061 --> 00:23:36,497
The president's bedroom is there,
the first lady's is there.

282
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,654
First lady?

283
00:23:37,732 --> 00:23:39,165
You won't even see her.

284
00:23:39,234 --> 00:23:40,826
They barely talk anymore.

285
00:23:40,902 --> 00:23:42,836
-You're kidding.
-It happens.

286
00:23:48,577 --> 00:23:50,841
And this is where you'll be sleeping.

287
00:23:56,885 --> 00:23:58,113
You all right?

288
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,416
-It's very nice.
-Come this way.

289
00:24:01,089 --> 00:24:03,250
I'm sure you'll be comfortable here.

290
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:06,352
We'll be back to get you in the morning.

291
00:24:06,795 --> 00:24:09,696
The Secret Service man
is outside the door.

292
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,693
Good night, Mr. President.

293
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:13,859
Good night.

294
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,264
Sleep tight.

295
00:24:22,477 --> 00:24:23,603
Thank you.

296
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,795
Nothing. Good night.

297
00:25:04,486 --> 00:25:05,646
Nothing.

298
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,149
Good night.

299
00:25:32,147 --> 00:25:34,638
At 10:45 last night, President Mitchell...

300
00:25:34,749 --> 00:25:38,685
...coming home from giving
a speech to the Legal Counsel...

301
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,581
...suffered a minor circulatory problem
of the head.

302
00:25:43,391 --> 00:25:46,849
Reports that he had suffered
a severe stroke are erroneous.

303
00:25:47,229 --> 00:25:50,687
Doctors report that he should be back
to his normal schedule soon.

304
00:25:50,765 --> 00:25:54,030
Now let me stress again,
this is a minor medical problem.

305
00:25:54,369 --> 00:25:57,202
The president has complete use
of his faculties...

306
00:25:57,405 --> 00:25:59,805
...and retains full executive authority.

307
00:25:59,874 --> 00:26:01,102
Any questions?

308
00:26:01,276 --> 00:26:03,744
<i>The White House classifies</i>
<i>the president's condition...</i>

309
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,474
<i>...as a slight circulatory problem</i>
<i>of the head.</i>

310
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,115
<i>While technically a stroke...</i>

311
00:26:08,183 --> 00:26:11,710
<i>...White House spokesmen say</i>
<i>that his condition is far from serious...</i>

312
00:26:11,786 --> 00:26:14,118
<i>...and he should be up and about</i>
<i>some time soon.</i>

313
00:26:14,189 --> 00:26:16,623
Do you know how many laws
we've broken?

314
00:26:19,928 --> 00:26:21,452
It's simple, Alan.

315
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,955
We send the vice-president
to Africa or something.

316
00:26:25,233 --> 00:26:28,566
We dig up some dirt on him
and then force him to resign...

317
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,968
...and get our president
to nominate a new one.

318
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,836
It will take a couple of weeks.

319
00:26:32,974 --> 00:26:36,637
You mean, we get Dave
to nominate you as vice-president?

320
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,206
I was a senator.

321
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,838
Oh, I know.

322
00:26:41,116 --> 00:26:43,550
And when our poor president
has another stroke...

323
00:26:43,652 --> 00:26:45,916
...this time much more serious...

324
00:26:46,221 --> 00:26:48,746
...our newly appointed VP becomes....

325
00:26:48,923 --> 00:26:49,912
Jeez.

326
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:52,492
What about containment?

327
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:54,253
Thanks.

328
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:01,597
We got the nurses for 50 grand apiece,
and the doctors for 100.

329
00:27:02,003 --> 00:27:03,595
The older guy wanted a head of the CDC.

330
00:27:03,772 --> 00:27:05,364
Is that everybody?

331
00:27:05,507 --> 00:27:07,975
Duane's got his guys under control.

332
00:27:08,143 --> 00:27:09,974
Good. What about her?

333
00:27:10,145 --> 00:27:11,134
Her?

334
00:27:11,479 --> 00:27:13,504
Oh, the first lady?

335
00:27:14,182 --> 00:27:19,017
When she gave her speech at Bryn Mawr,
I managed to catch her before she left.

336
00:27:19,187 --> 00:27:20,154
And?

337
00:27:20,622 --> 00:27:24,683
I told her his blood pressure went up
after an incident at the hotel.

338
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,118
She hates him more than ever.

339
00:27:27,195 --> 00:27:28,287
Fine.

340
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:32,625
Everybody else is buying
the ''minor stroke'' story.

341
00:27:34,969 --> 00:27:37,460
Let's hope this yutz can pull it off.

342
00:27:38,173 --> 00:27:43,236
These are amazing results. I must say,
even for a man with a minor stroke...

343
00:27:43,345 --> 00:27:46,405
...you seem to have made
a remarkable recovery.

344
00:27:46,548 --> 00:27:47,674
Great.

345
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,511
I'm feeling better.

346
00:27:50,218 --> 00:27:53,153
No signs of paralysis.
No circulatory changes.

347
00:27:53,455 --> 00:27:56,549
Your ECG is completely normal and...

348
00:27:57,192 --> 00:27:59,490
...your blood pressure has gone down.

349
00:27:59,728 --> 00:28:01,821
Have you been exercising recently?

350
00:28:04,332 --> 00:28:06,129
Yes. I mean...

351
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,296
...bicycling and...

352
00:28:09,704 --> 00:28:10,864
...weight lifting.

353
00:28:10,972 --> 00:28:12,439
Looking after the diet.

354
00:28:14,843 --> 00:28:16,333
Polo, climbing...

355
00:28:19,714 --> 00:28:20,703
...like that.

356
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:24,240
Well, judging by these tests,
I see no reason why you can't...

357
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,511
...return to work in a few days.

358
00:28:26,688 --> 00:28:27,848
-Great.
-Good.

359
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,014
Good.

360
00:28:29,357 --> 00:28:30,449
Good.

361
00:28:44,606 --> 00:28:45,698
Hold it.

362
00:28:46,775 --> 00:28:49,209
Remember everybody's name, faces?

363
00:28:50,345 --> 00:28:51,778
Keep it simple.

364
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,880
Course. Watch.

365
00:28:59,721 --> 00:29:01,188
'Morning, ladies.

366
00:29:02,891 --> 00:29:05,052
-Good to see you.
-Welcome back, sir.

367
00:29:05,126 --> 00:29:08,357
Good to be back. Just a false alarm.
Nothing to worry about.

368
00:29:09,731 --> 00:29:12,256
-Good morning, Mr. President.
-Nice to see you.

369
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,460
It's good to be alive, isn't it?

370
00:29:17,238 --> 00:29:19,729
Good morning, Mr. President.
I was really worried.

371
00:29:19,808 --> 00:29:21,298
I didn't know what was going on.

372
00:29:21,609 --> 00:29:23,338
I'm glad you're feeling better.

373
00:29:23,411 --> 00:29:24,901
Why didn't you call me?

374
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:28,776
-You really had me worried!
-Well, I'm fine.

375
00:29:29,317 --> 00:29:30,614
-What's with her?
-Ignore it.

376
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:33,449
She's emotional.
She's attached to the president.

377
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,819
Remember, you are the president.

378
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,990
Okay, let's get back to work.

379
00:29:39,461 --> 00:29:41,827
Sick time is done. Let's call the--

380
00:29:44,499 --> 00:29:46,990
False alarm. I'm fine. Everything's fine.

381
00:29:48,303 --> 00:29:49,361
He's okay.

382
00:29:50,305 --> 00:29:52,034
Let's go over it again.

383
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,931
You met a girl. You fell in love.

384
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,672
And we're going away.

385
00:29:56,744 --> 00:29:57,836
For a month.

386
00:29:57,912 --> 00:30:00,107
-A month?
-Right. Don't embellish.

387
00:30:02,317 --> 00:30:03,909
Do I need to dial nine?

388
00:30:06,187 --> 00:30:07,620
As soon as we sat down...

389
00:30:07,689 --> 00:30:10,681
...he pulls out this ring
and I got so emotional...

390
00:30:10,825 --> 00:30:13,794
...I had to ask the waiter
to bring another napkin.

391
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,055
Hang on.

392
00:30:17,966 --> 00:30:19,194
Kovic Temps.

393
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:21,997
Where are you?

394
00:30:26,508 --> 00:30:27,805
You met who?

395
00:30:31,145 --> 00:30:32,578
You're going where?

396
00:30:33,848 --> 00:30:35,213
Cancun?

397
00:30:37,986 --> 00:30:40,386
Oh, I think that's great.

398
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:43,989
She's very special. She's beautiful.
She's a princess.

399
00:30:44,058 --> 00:30:47,585
She's really exotic and wonderful.

400
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,764
She's Polynesian.

401
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:54,159
Well, half Polynesian and half American.

402
00:30:54,802 --> 00:30:56,292
She's Amnesian.

403
00:30:56,704 --> 00:30:57,762
Hang up.

404
00:30:58,172 --> 00:31:01,266
-She has a hang-up though.
-Hang up the phone.

405
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,900
Don't talk about that when you meet her.

406
00:31:02,977 --> 00:31:05,810
I've gotta go now. I'll call you later. 'Bye.

407
00:31:07,248 --> 00:31:08,306
It worked.

408
00:31:10,985 --> 00:31:12,350
He's in love.

409
00:31:14,088 --> 00:31:15,521
Thank God.

410
00:31:15,757 --> 00:31:20,194
The president continued convalescing,
resting for the second day.

411
00:31:20,528 --> 00:31:23,691
His personal physician
pronounced him in perfect health.

412
00:31:23,765 --> 00:31:25,824
I have examined him thoroughly...

413
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:29,869
...and I don't believe I have ever seen
the president in better shape.

414
00:31:30,104 --> 00:31:33,699
<i>The president was able to attend</i>
<i>to some official business Wednesday...</i>

415
00:31:33,775 --> 00:31:37,370
<i>...and continues to be briefed</i>
<i>on all areas of national concern.</i>

416
00:31:37,845 --> 00:31:39,904
The upper house and the lower house.

417
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:43,781
Senators are elected to six-year terms
and congressmen are elected to two.

418
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,449
Judiciary?

419
00:31:45,853 --> 00:31:47,377
Veterans Affairs?

420
00:31:48,556 --> 00:31:49,682
Mark Davis.

421
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,587
Agriculture?

422
00:31:53,194 --> 00:31:55,287
Cows, cows, calves, Metcalf.

423
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,125
Lawrence Metcalf. He's right there.

424
00:31:57,198 --> 00:32:00,224
<i>So confident is the White House</i>
<i>about the president's recovery...</i>

425
00:32:00,301 --> 00:32:04,795
<i>...that the vice-president has been sent</i>
<i>on a 12-nation African goodwill tour.</i>

426
00:32:05,139 --> 00:32:07,607
This is Sander Vanocur
at the White House.

427
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:11,805
First we'll go over mannerisms.
Alan has worked out a training program.

428
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,742
Great.

429
00:32:12,814 --> 00:32:14,611
This is the briefing room...

430
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:17,480
...where the president
holds his press conferences.

431
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,218
This may seem strange at first, but...

432
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:24,188
...even real politicians have trouble
getting used to the cameras--

433
00:32:24,258 --> 00:32:25,520
A TelePrompTer.

434
00:32:26,461 --> 00:32:27,928
A TelePrompTer. Is it hooked up?

435
00:32:27,996 --> 00:32:29,327
I don't think so.

436
00:32:31,966 --> 00:32:35,367
As I was saying, no one expects you
to be Bill Mitchell overnight.

437
00:32:35,436 --> 00:32:39,099
The most important thing
to remember is his general presence.

438
00:32:40,141 --> 00:32:42,132
Now, whenever he stands at the podium...

439
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,737
...President Mitchell always has
one hand in the pocket of his coat.

440
00:32:46,414 --> 00:32:47,642
At a press conference.

441
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:50,115
Otherwise, they're always on the podium.

442
00:32:50,752 --> 00:32:52,151
I'm not certain about that.

443
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,051
Remember the convention speech?

444
00:32:54,122 --> 00:32:57,421
''An America,
stronger than the one we were given.

445
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:00,457
''An America,
prouder than the one we found.''

446
00:33:01,796 --> 00:33:04,287
Right there on the podium.
Except on ''America,'' he points.

447
00:33:04,365 --> 00:33:06,333
That's very good.

448
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,834
Oh, I love that speech.

449
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,369
Thanks. I wrote it.

450
00:33:09,637 --> 00:33:10,626
You did?

451
00:33:11,506 --> 00:33:12,803
It's great!

452
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:16,001
''Somewhere, there is a distant light...

453
00:33:16,711 --> 00:33:19,441
''...guiding us through this rocky shoal.

454
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,713
''America isn't what we say here tonight.

455
00:33:24,652 --> 00:33:28,679
''lt's in the faces and the smiles
of a Sunday afternoon.

456
00:33:30,024 --> 00:33:31,924
''lt's in the gentle kindness...

457
00:33:31,993 --> 00:33:33,824
''...of the family kitchen...

458
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,892
''...as we gather together...

459
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,263
''...when the sun goes down.''

460
00:33:45,873 --> 00:33:47,067
Can I keep this?

461
00:33:54,682 --> 00:33:56,650
-I thought I wouldn't see her.
-Just five minutes.

462
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:59,344
She walks in, you wave, she leaves.

463
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,751
First lady. I mean,
couldn't I start with a cousin?

464
00:34:02,824 --> 00:34:05,691
She hardly ever sees him.
It'll be fast, she won't be able to tell.

465
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,055
Stop whining.

466
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,786
If you can convince her,
you can convince anybody.

467
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,188
All right.

468
00:34:13,367 --> 00:34:15,028
We're ready for Mrs. Mitchell.

469
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,463
As soon as she comes in,
we'll move you out to the balcony.

470
00:34:20,942 --> 00:34:24,878
All you have to say is,
''Thanks for doing this, Ellen.''

471
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,309
''Thanks for doing this, Ellen.''

472
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,111
She doesn't always like this stuff.
It might soften her up.

473
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,877
''Thanks for doing this, Ellen.''

474
00:34:37,425 --> 00:34:40,952
Why can't you die from a stroke
like everybody else?

475
00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:49,393
What are you staring at?

476
00:34:52,607 --> 00:34:54,802
Mrs. Mitchell, we're going to do it up here.

477
00:34:57,078 --> 00:34:58,477
Who was she?

478
00:34:59,714 --> 00:35:01,739
Another patriotic secretary?

479
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,744
Thank you for doing this, Ellen.

480
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:10,255
Go to hell, Bill.

481
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,653
I think we can start now.

482
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:16,456
And you can tell these two pit vipers...

483
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,625
...that this is the last one of these
I'll do for awhile.

484
00:35:25,106 --> 00:35:27,097
You're doing just fine.

485
00:35:42,123 --> 00:35:43,090
Wave!

486
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:50,187
Mr. President, how are you feeling?

487
00:35:50,298 --> 00:35:51,390
Fine.

488
00:35:51,632 --> 00:35:52,291
Fine.

489
00:35:52,366 --> 00:35:53,731
Ready to get back to work?

490
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,195
You bet.

491
00:35:56,604 --> 00:35:57,696
You bet.

492
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,204
I'm out of here.

493
00:35:59,307 --> 00:36:00,296
Shit.

494
00:36:01,876 --> 00:36:04,436
Are you making the decisions?
Are you back in charge?

495
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,708
Go!

496
00:36:08,316 --> 00:36:09,749
Go, go, go!

497
00:36:21,362 --> 00:36:23,330
Don't you have anything to say to me?

498
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:29,158
Thank you for doing this, Ellen.

499
00:36:30,972 --> 00:36:32,667
You don't change, do you?

500
00:36:38,012 --> 00:36:39,570
She hates me.

501
00:36:42,683 --> 00:36:45,243
Wave to the camera. Wave to the camera.

502
00:37:10,945 --> 00:37:13,038
Here we go. First we'll talk to...

503
00:37:13,214 --> 00:37:16,615
...Ted on the new
Land Management Legislation.

504
00:37:18,786 --> 00:37:21,880
I think if you refer to ltem 3
on the memorandum...

505
00:37:22,089 --> 00:37:24,557
...you'll notice that the....

506
00:37:25,393 --> 00:37:29,625
Slip your arms in there, and the machine
will do everything your arms do.

507
00:37:38,205 --> 00:37:39,729
I once caught a fish...

508
00:37:40,975 --> 00:37:43,136
...this big.

509
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:46,376
This is great.

510
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,683
Everybody!

511
00:38:01,128 --> 00:38:02,425
Good boy!

512
00:38:06,968 --> 00:38:08,026
Got you!

513
00:38:08,636 --> 00:38:12,072
This guy has had a rebirth.
This is a different fella.

514
00:38:12,139 --> 00:38:14,937
It's not often, but when you're right,
you're right.

515
00:38:15,009 --> 00:38:18,172
There's been a transformation.
What's in the water over there?

516
00:38:18,346 --> 00:38:20,678
It's not the water
or anything else you drank.

517
00:38:20,948 --> 00:38:24,850
He has faced death in the eye
and has been transformed by it.

518
00:38:24,952 --> 00:38:27,785
-The boss looks better since the stroke.
-Thanks, Mr. Speaker.

519
00:38:27,955 --> 00:38:29,616
-He's doing well.
-Thanks.

520
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:31,214
-I'll tell him.
-Tell him I send him my best.

521
00:38:31,592 --> 00:38:32,957
Good to see you.

522
00:38:35,796 --> 00:38:38,162
Let me ask you a question now:

523
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,166
What is with the president lately?

524
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:44,128
The guy's been having too many
Happy Meals for lunch or what?

525
00:38:45,439 --> 00:38:47,669
Let's talk about desserts.

526
00:38:48,476 --> 00:38:51,968
What you don't want to do
is eat doughnuts.

527
00:38:53,114 --> 00:38:54,376
No doughnuts.

528
00:38:55,349 --> 00:38:56,873
Thank you, Arnold.

529
00:38:57,651 --> 00:38:59,642
Arnold, thank you so much.

530
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,651
Want to Indian-wrestle?

531
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:07,726
<i>Throwing out the ceremonial first pitch...</i>

532
00:39:07,795 --> 00:39:10,662
<i>...the President of the United States.</i>

533
00:39:44,932 --> 00:39:48,197
<i>From the nation's capital,</i>
<i>''the McLaughlin Group.''</i>

534
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:52,269
<i>An unrehearsed program presenting</i>
<i>inside opinions and forecasts...</i>

535
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,704
...on major issues of the day.

536
00:39:55,409 --> 00:39:57,639
Here's the moderator, John McLaughlin.

537
00:39:57,778 --> 00:40:00,576
Issue 1 : the new Bill Mitchell.

538
00:40:01,282 --> 00:40:02,943
Two weeks after his brush with death...

539
00:40:03,017 --> 00:40:05,815
...the president's bounding
around the country...

540
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,514
...with the energy
of a high-school track star.

541
00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:10,648
Is this merely overcompensation...

542
00:40:10,791 --> 00:40:14,420
...or the indefatigable greatness
of a truly great man?

543
00:40:14,695 --> 00:40:15,753
<i>Freddie Barnes?</i>

544
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:19,561
<i>The illness just crystallized</i>
<i>his thinking about his presidency.</i>

545
00:40:19,633 --> 00:40:21,328
<i>He realized he didn't have to be a zombie.</i>

546
00:40:21,402 --> 00:40:23,927
<i>He can show some life,</i>
<i>even act like a child.</i>

547
00:40:24,038 --> 00:40:27,269
<i>He shows the same strength of character</i>
<i>as right after his election.</i>

548
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:30,469
<i>The guy got sick.</i>
<i>He recovered from illness.</i>

549
00:40:30,544 --> 00:40:32,341
<i>He's now rejuvenated.</i>

550
00:40:32,413 --> 00:40:35,974
<i>On a political rehabilitation scale</i>
<i>of zero to ten...</i>

551
00:40:36,217 --> 00:40:38,742
<i>...rate the rehabilitation of our president.</i>

552
00:40:38,919 --> 00:40:40,887
<i>It's an eight. The zombie is gone.</i>

553
00:40:40,955 --> 00:40:43,185
<i>It's a three. The zombie will return.</i>

554
00:40:43,457 --> 00:40:46,255
<i>I think it's an 8.6.</i>
<i>He's still out to lunch, but looking good.</i>

555
00:40:46,427 --> 00:40:49,089
<i>The answer is eight. We'll be right back.</i>

556
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:01,564
So the...

557
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:05,336
...first lady and the president....

558
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:08,833
What is that?
How long has that been going on?

559
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:11,000
I can't say.

560
00:42:12,213 --> 00:42:14,875
You mean, you don't know
or you can't say?

561
00:42:16,217 --> 00:42:17,411
I can't say.

562
00:42:19,353 --> 00:42:20,786
Can't say.

563
00:42:26,427 --> 00:42:31,194
So your job is to protect the president
all the time? That's your whole job?

564
00:42:35,703 --> 00:42:37,136
Have a gun?

565
00:42:39,607 --> 00:42:40,733
Ever use it?

566
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:43,602
Not yet.

567
00:42:53,721 --> 00:42:55,746
I've always wondered about you guys.

568
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,823
They say you'd take a bullet
for the president.

569
00:42:59,093 --> 00:43:00,321
What about it?

570
00:43:00,794 --> 00:43:02,125
Is that true?

571
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:05,722
Would you let yourself be killed
to save his life?

572
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,224
Certainly.

573
00:43:12,806 --> 00:43:16,333
So that means now you would
get killed for me, too.

574
00:43:30,758 --> 00:43:33,591
It'd be great for you
and great for the president.

575
00:43:33,761 --> 00:43:37,162
I'm sorry, the only time
I have available is the 25th.

576
00:43:37,264 --> 00:43:38,322
Are you crazy?

577
00:43:38,399 --> 00:43:41,368
That's the best I can do.
I'll get back to you.

578
00:43:41,769 --> 00:43:44,237
You scheduled a day with the first lady?

579
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:46,602
-It's a homeless shelter.
-Oh, excuse me.

580
00:43:46,674 --> 00:43:47,868
It's going to be great.

581
00:43:48,008 --> 00:43:50,636
Caring about his wife,
spending time on her favorite issues.

582
00:43:50,744 --> 00:43:54,680
I don't want him caring about his wife.
What about the vice-president?

583
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,180
The vice-president?

584
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:01,514
Well, you remember that First Liberty stuff
we almost got nailed on?

585
00:44:03,524 --> 00:44:06,186
I just dumped it on him instead.

586
00:44:07,861 --> 00:44:09,556
-When does it break?
-Few days.

587
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:12,622
Look at Dave's tracking polls.
They'll burn up in your hands.

588
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:16,158
Seventy-three percent with seniors,
eighty-four percent with working mothers.

589
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,227
We still gotta control this guy.

590
00:44:28,982 --> 00:44:30,643
Why are you doing this?

591
00:44:31,518 --> 00:44:32,542
What?

592
00:44:32,653 --> 00:44:35,315
Since when do you care
about the homeless?

593
00:44:36,056 --> 00:44:37,785
I care about the homeless.

594
00:44:38,359 --> 00:44:40,919
I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.

595
00:45:07,888 --> 00:45:12,655
Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. President.

596
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:16,729
Good morning, kids. How are you?
Thank you for that nice welcome.

597
00:45:22,069 --> 00:45:23,502
They are all kids.

598
00:45:24,071 --> 00:45:26,699
That's right, Bill. Kids are homeless, too.

599
00:45:27,908 --> 00:45:29,170
Where are the parents?

600
00:45:29,343 --> 00:45:32,744
A lot of them are in shelters,
but some are still on the street.

601
00:45:33,747 --> 00:45:35,009
Shake hands.

602
00:45:35,416 --> 00:45:36,508
Hi, there.

603
00:45:38,419 --> 00:45:39,408
Hello.

604
00:45:41,855 --> 00:45:43,186
-What's your name?
-Brandon.

605
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:44,416
How do you do?

606
00:45:46,026 --> 00:45:48,460
What happens when kids
become homeless is...

607
00:45:48,529 --> 00:45:51,020
...they lose communication skills.

608
00:45:51,198 --> 00:45:53,530
So here they play a lot of games...

609
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:58,262
...that encourage kids to relate
to each other and to express themselves.

610
00:45:59,139 --> 00:46:01,937
Oh, no, poor Joe...

611
00:46:02,476 --> 00:46:05,673
...he has no hair.

612
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:09,613
Oh, no, poor Joe...

613
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:11,008
...he has no...

614
00:46:11,118 --> 00:46:12,551
...eyes.

615
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:15,154
Right. Very good. Let's try one more.

616
00:46:15,222 --> 00:46:18,658
Everybody together, now.
Everybody pay attention.

617
00:46:19,059 --> 00:46:21,687
Oh, no, poor Joe.

618
00:46:21,762 --> 00:46:23,559
-He has no....
-Feet.

619
00:46:24,965 --> 00:46:27,263
Great, great, great. All right.

620
00:46:31,939 --> 00:46:32,997
Hi, there.

621
00:46:34,808 --> 00:46:35,968
What's your name?

622
00:46:37,411 --> 00:46:38,400
David.

623
00:46:38,479 --> 00:46:39,605
David?

624
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,105
Great name.

625
00:46:43,951 --> 00:46:45,646
What are you doing here?

626
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:48,078
Nothing.

627
00:46:50,757 --> 00:46:53,089
Hey, guys. Not now, okay?

628
00:46:54,094 --> 00:46:55,152
Thanks.

629
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,093
Don't you like playing games with them?

630
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,066
Do you like magic?

631
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:09,602
It's okay.

632
00:47:09,776 --> 00:47:10,800
Okay.

633
00:47:11,845 --> 00:47:13,176
Watch this.

634
00:47:19,019 --> 00:47:20,179
Where'd it go?

635
00:47:20,521 --> 00:47:22,011
The answer is in this riddle.

636
00:47:22,322 --> 00:47:25,086
What can run all day
without ever getting tired?

637
00:47:25,692 --> 00:47:26,681
Do you know?

638
00:47:27,961 --> 00:47:29,258
I'll give you a hint.

639
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:31,120
It's not your ear.

640
00:47:31,865 --> 00:47:33,526
And it's not your mouth.

641
00:47:34,468 --> 00:47:35,696
My nose.

642
00:47:35,869 --> 00:47:36,961
Your nose.

643
00:47:37,137 --> 00:47:40,197
Exactly. And look, there it is.

644
00:47:40,474 --> 00:47:42,465
See? It was there all the time.

645
00:47:42,643 --> 00:47:44,133
It went up in the air.

646
00:47:47,314 --> 00:47:48,975
And fell on my nose.

647
00:47:53,887 --> 00:47:55,548
Is the first lady still there?

648
00:47:58,058 --> 00:47:59,389
Does she look mad?

649
00:48:01,061 --> 00:48:02,255
Not really.

650
00:48:02,329 --> 00:48:03,318
Good.

651
00:48:04,164 --> 00:48:07,224
First cover of ''Time'' magazine
and I need a shave.

652
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,327
Tough little moment with the dog.

653
00:48:10,737 --> 00:48:12,329
There you are on the cover.

654
00:48:12,673 --> 00:48:14,072
Good, huh? Front page.

655
00:48:14,241 --> 00:48:16,402
-That's you behind me.
-Where, what?

656
00:48:16,577 --> 00:48:18,408
See? Here's me.

657
00:48:18,779 --> 00:48:19,871
Look here.

658
00:48:19,947 --> 00:48:23,246
You see those 20 guys and then,
bing, there you are.

659
00:48:23,417 --> 00:48:25,476
-This is me?
-Looking very strong and...

660
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,245
...forbidding.

661
00:48:28,855 --> 00:48:32,916
Have you ever thought about wearing
a sweater! You'd blend in more.

662
00:48:34,294 --> 00:48:37,024
There you are again,
coming off the helicopter.

663
00:48:37,264 --> 00:48:39,926
Sweaters make my neck look too thick.

664
00:48:40,734 --> 00:48:43,430
Really? You got a sweater vest?
You could wear a tie.

665
00:48:43,604 --> 00:48:45,697
Would a sweater vest look good on me?

666
00:48:50,611 --> 00:48:52,943
Where's the Simpson-Gardner paperwork?

667
00:48:53,113 --> 00:48:55,445
Excuse me. It's right here.

668
00:48:56,049 --> 00:48:58,711
-Just came in.
-I think he's going to veto it.

669
00:49:12,966 --> 00:49:15,958
Bill Mitchell...

670
00:49:20,641 --> 00:49:22,438
...votes no.

671
00:49:30,317 --> 00:49:33,343
''Hail to the Chief
He's the one we all say 'Hail' to

672
00:49:34,421 --> 00:49:38,585
''We all say 'Hail' to the Chief
'Cause he keeps himself so clean.''

673
00:49:39,192 --> 00:49:41,126
He's got the power.

674
00:49:41,261 --> 00:49:44,424
That's why he's in the shower.

675
00:49:45,999 --> 00:49:48,490
I can't believe you would do
something like this.

676
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,168
Not even you.

677
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:51,935
How could you?

678
00:49:53,507 --> 00:49:54,303
What?

679
00:49:54,374 --> 00:49:57,275
Don't patronize me.
I'm not one of your bimbos.

680
00:49:58,879 --> 00:50:00,403
And turn around.

681
00:50:01,281 --> 00:50:04,011
I'm talking to you. Turn around.

682
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,351
Turn around.

683
00:50:14,661 --> 00:50:17,129
If you want to be the same old selfish...

684
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:18,523
...bastard.

685
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:21,958
Go ahead. I've gotten used to it.

686
00:50:22,035 --> 00:50:26,199
But don't put on this ''man of the people''
routine and then do something like this.

687
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,229
I don't understand.

688
00:50:28,308 --> 00:50:31,209
You know that wasn't
a Works Bill you vetoed.

689
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,709
That would've given those kids homes!

690
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:38,214
When I think of that spectacle you put on
with that boy and the magic trick.

691
00:50:39,086 --> 00:50:41,020
What's wrong with the magic trick?

692
00:50:41,154 --> 00:50:44,487
It was some magic.
You made their funding disappear!

693
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,653
If there's some mistake--

694
00:50:46,827 --> 00:50:50,490
When you veto their funding,
that's not a mistake.

695
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:53,994
When you hurt someone intentionally,
that's not a mistake.

696
00:51:13,253 --> 00:51:15,744
Call Bob. Call Alan. I want to see them.

697
00:51:16,056 --> 00:51:17,717
But it's 10:30 at night.

698
00:51:17,858 --> 00:51:18,950
You got it.

699
00:51:26,633 --> 00:51:27,964
What the hell is this?

700
00:51:28,034 --> 00:51:29,433
What is this?

701
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:31,632
''The New York Times.''

702
00:51:31,705 --> 00:51:33,104
No, this.

703
00:51:34,775 --> 00:51:36,766
''President vetoes Works Bill.''

704
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:38,672
We vetoed that?

705
00:51:40,046 --> 00:51:41,707
We didn't veto anything.

706
00:51:42,549 --> 00:51:45,780
These things get awfully complicated
sometimes, and you have to--

707
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:47,251
The shelter was in this bill.

708
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,982
-Handle this.
-Believe me, Dave, if we could have--

709
00:51:50,056 --> 00:51:51,887
Lots of shelters were in this bill.

710
00:51:51,958 --> 00:51:53,858
Listen, you little shit!

711
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:58,297
The budget is a very complicated thing.
I don't understand it sometimes.

712
00:51:58,565 --> 00:52:01,227
Occasionally, we have to make some cuts.
And in order--

713
00:52:01,301 --> 00:52:02,791
But we went there.

714
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,364
-We saw those kids.
-Yes, you did.

715
00:52:06,606 --> 00:52:10,201
And if you find a way to cut
$650 million from the budget...

716
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:12,244
...you can keep your shelters.

717
00:52:17,818 --> 00:52:19,251
And by the way...

718
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,415
...don't ever send for me again.

719
00:52:42,943 --> 00:52:44,001
Can I help you?

720
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:45,567
I'm here to see the president.

721
00:52:45,645 --> 00:52:46,873
Is that right?

722
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,445
He asked me to come.

723
00:52:48,548 --> 00:52:49,947
And your name?

724
00:52:50,383 --> 00:52:52,180
Murray Blum. B-L-U-M.

725
00:52:52,352 --> 00:52:53,341
Come on, Dave.

726
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,388
-Sit down.
-I don't want to sit there.

727
00:52:55,455 --> 00:52:57,685
-Come on.
-I don't want to. Please.

728
00:52:58,124 --> 00:52:59,352
Okay, fine.

729
00:53:00,861 --> 00:53:03,125
This place is probably bugged.

730
00:53:03,296 --> 00:53:05,958
It's not bugged. It's okay, Murray.

731
00:53:11,705 --> 00:53:14,970
You could get in so much trouble
if they find out.

732
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:16,871
-Who?
-The government.

733
00:53:17,377 --> 00:53:19,470
I'm the government.

734
00:53:21,147 --> 00:53:22,307
Wild, huh?

735
00:53:24,017 --> 00:53:27,544
I can't tell you the whole story.
It's a national emergency thing.

736
00:53:27,921 --> 00:53:29,889
You've gotta help me cut the budget.

737
00:53:32,425 --> 00:53:34,120
You need to cut the budget?

738
00:53:34,661 --> 00:53:37,494
About 650 million dollars.

739
00:53:39,232 --> 00:53:40,529
You look hungry?

740
00:53:42,903 --> 00:53:44,393
Please come in here.

741
00:53:45,739 --> 00:53:46,899
Just watch.

742
00:53:48,408 --> 00:53:49,898
Yes, Mr. President?

743
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:51,705
We need two copies of the budget.

744
00:53:51,778 --> 00:53:55,009
And could you arrange for dinner for two
in the dining room?

745
00:53:55,181 --> 00:53:56,273
Right away, sir.

746
00:53:56,449 --> 00:53:58,815
We have work to do
so we're not to be disturbed.

747
00:53:58,919 --> 00:54:00,284
I understand, sir.

748
00:54:01,187 --> 00:54:05,351
Do you think they could rustle up
some bratwurst and mustard?

749
00:54:05,525 --> 00:54:07,254
I think it can be arranged.

750
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:11,758
I love bratwurst.

751
00:54:12,032 --> 00:54:13,090
I know.
