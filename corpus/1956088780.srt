1
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,140
You're 40 minutes late

2
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:25,110
What's her story?

3
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,345
I don't know.

4
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,880
She came from up in New England somewhere.

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,300
Some witch trial protector of women nonsense.

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,200
Was it late 1600s?

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,519
Do I look like a curator? Check the file.

8
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,800
Make sure you lock up when you're done.

9
00:00:53,835 --> 00:00:55,800
[Quiet, distant screams.]

10
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,800
And if you even think that you can just waltz in here tomorrow-

11
00:01:02,835 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay. See you then,

12
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,760
[Door closes.]

13
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,440
You're a beauty, aren't you?

14
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,880
Ow.

15
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,180
[Inessa Gasps.]

16
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,859
Goddamnit, Inessa.

17
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,745
Please Ted, what are you doing back?

18
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,520
Do you have any idea how expensive this stuff is?

19
00:02:33,555 --> 00:02:34,725
I can explain-.

20
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,429
That's the problem with you.

21
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,090
Even if you knew how expensive it was, I don't think you'd give a shit.

22
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,910
Relax, Ted. Check your attitude.

23
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,200
What?

24
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,780
What did you just say?

25
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
Check my attitude?

26
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,679
Oh, that's rich. That's real rich coming from you.

27
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:01,230
Look. I don't know what you did to defile yourself, to permanently put yourself in

28
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:05,159
Mr. Granville's good graces, but I am your direct supervisor, and I have had enough!

29
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,549
You don't respect my authority, you don't respect my time, and you certainly don't respect my equipment!

30
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,409
I'll be damned if you aren't gonna respect me enough to look me in the eye when I fire your ass!

31
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,760
What?!

32
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:32,240
[Rock shifting, sound of breathing from the statue.]

33
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,020
[Soft breathing from the statue, Inessa panting.]

34
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,840
[Distant voice speaking indiscernible words.]

35
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,580
[Wind howling.]

36
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,085
Rebecca.

37
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,120
Leave me alone Tim.

38
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,265
You're hurt.

39
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,080
I'm fine. Just please leave me alone. I don't need this today.

40
00:04:50,115 --> 00:04:51,520
You're not as alone as you think.

41
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,900
Come to worship to Sunday. You'll find that no situation is beyond God's reach.

42
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,230
Is that right?

43
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:05,189
So tell me, where was he last night around 11:30? Maybe could have used some help then.

44
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:17,060
If you feel that God is ignoring you then perhaps you should spend some more time on your knees.

45
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,440
No class again this week?

46
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,449
It's okay. Let me see.

47
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,100
[Sigh.]

48
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,920
He was drunk.

49
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,659
I shouldn't have pushed it. It's my fault.

50
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:55,680
Rebecca, look at me

51
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,690
This is not your fault. Don't ever let me hear you say that again.

52
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,719
I don't know what to do.

53
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,280
Pack your things. You're coming with me.

54
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,305
What are we doing here?

55
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,000
There's something I want to show you.

56
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,460
Come on.

57
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,080
Follow me.

58
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,180
Watch your step.

59
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,940
Watch your head.

60
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,680
What is this place?

61
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,320
My sister used to bring me here when I was about your age.

62
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,760
She used to work in a museum.

63
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,888
she discovered something amazing before she died.

64
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,520
I've tried to keep it safe for her.

65
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,919
Until I find the right person to give it to.

66
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,020
Give what?

67
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,840
What is that?

68
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,580
(Distorted voice.) A power.

69
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,880
[Discordant sounds, indistinct yelling.]

70
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,460
(Same distorted voice) To fight men like him.

71
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,840
Come to me.

72
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,000
[Rebecca gasps.]

73
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,460
[Grunting in discomfort.]

74
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,380
[Tim whistles.]

75
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,539
Goddamnit Tim, just leave me alone.

76
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,560
You sick?

77
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,300
Stop following me.

78
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,685
Come on. Sit up.

79
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,140
No. [Rebecca slaps Tim.]

80
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,020
Why is it so difficult to make you people understand?

81
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,919
[Muffled cries. Tim shushing.]

82
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,179
You know, someone really should have taught you some manners.

83
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,640
On your knees

84
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,980
[Bone snaps, Tim cries out in pain.]

85
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,600
Please. Please please don't, Rebecca.

86
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,880
Six atom, Dispatch, repeat last? Some kind of interference.

87
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,620
[Radio static] We have a-

88
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,540
[Cut off by static.]

89
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,780
[Crow sound, followed by a thud.]

90
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,680
What the hell?

91
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,980
Hey!

92
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,660
Hey, wait! Come here, hey!

93
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Hello?

94
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:52,999
Hello?

95
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,900
It's okay, don't be afraid. I'm a police officer.

96
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,860
[Door creaking, then clicking shut.]

97
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,360
[Sudden radio interference. Indistinct words over radio.]

98
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,219
Hey! Wait!

99
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,460
Stop!

100
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,360
Hey!

101
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,020
[Girl screams.]

102
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,100
[Continued screams.]

103
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,700
(Distant voices.) Answer me!

104
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,160
I'm sorry!

105
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,380
Where are you?

106
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,140
Come out!

107
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,880
[Girl screams.]

108
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,780
Where are you?

109
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:59,660
[Sounds of whipping.] I'm sorry! Stop! Please, Daddy!

110
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,000
Don't you talk back to me! (Said between strikes.)

111
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,480
What the fuck?

112
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Look familiar?

113
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,520
Rebecca?

114
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,330
Baby, what are you doing here?

115
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:21,002
I'm here to give you a message.

116
00:12:21,037 --> 00:12:22,640
What are you talking about?

117
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,765
What's going on?

118
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,040
I want to tell you that it doesn't matter.

119
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,225
It doesn't matter,

120
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,560
how many criminals you catch.

121
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,560
It doesn't matter that you pretend to quit drinking.

122
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:39,829
That you get to dress up,

123
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:41,759
and play hero.

124
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,820
You see, deep down I know who you really are.

125
00:12:45,855 --> 00:12:49,880
Alright, Rebecca whatever this is, this is over.

126
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:53,478
You and I are going home you understand me?

127
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,520
No.

128
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,339
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

129
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,560
Rebecca.

130
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,640
Rebecca! Come here.

131
00:13:01,675 --> 00:13:04,420
Re- ...Rebecca?

132
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,560
Rebecca.

133
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,420
Who is that behind you?

134
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,699
I hated you.

135
00:13:35,734 --> 00:13:37,699
So much.

136
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,320
Rebecca, who is that?

137
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,080
[Bones snapping.]

138
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,300
You can only beat a dog so many times before it learns to bite.

139
00:13:49,335 --> 00:13:50,859
[Rebecca screams.]

140
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,280
Watch new scary vids every Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.
