<i> Kung Fu Panda
<b> SECRETS OF THE MASTER </ b> </ i>

3
00:00:39,702 --> 00:00:42,026
<i> - Keep it down.
Hurry! We're running out of time.
</ I>

4
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,350
<i> - Whose hand is that?
- I Don't Even have hands. </ I>

5
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,698
<i> Quiet.
You'll compromise the mission. </ I>

6
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,048
<i> But, seriously, do I look like I have hands? :O</ i>

7
00:00:49,877 --> 00:00:51,016
Go, go. Go!

8
00:00:53,226 --> 00:00:55,281
Silent.
Like you're invisible.

9
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:57,731
Not even the slightest.. wh.. whoa!
(thud)

10
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:01,048
Quickl! Into the shadows.

11
00:01:09,161 --> 00:01:10,620
What?

12
00:01:10,865 --> 00:01:13,397
The new masters council exhibits!

13
00:01:13,534 --> 00:01:16,128
Take it in, breathe it in!

14
00:01:17,304 --> 00:01:19,159
Ooh! The smell of masters.

15
00:01:19,567 --> 00:01:21,789
Po, you said this was an emergency!

16
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:23,981
It was an emergency!
If we would've waited until tomorrow, 

17
00:01:24,088 --> 00:01:26,522
the lions would've been around the block. Ha ha ouhh

18
00:01:27,023 --> 00:01:28,487
Come on!
This is the greatest collection

19
00:01:28,545 --> 00:01:30,788
of Kung Fu memorabilia ever!

20
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:34,167
So, just to clear a few things up here,
We are not under attack?

21
00:01:34,257 --> 00:01:39,635
- Not yet.
- Aah! Look, the sword master Ox used to defeat the Macamuradas,

 
23
00:01:39,783 --> 00:01:41,726
Ah, I had no idea it was so shiny!

24
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:43,356
- Put that back.
- Woah!

25
00:01:43,453 --> 00:01:46,848
And the staff master Rhino used to 
liberate the village of Wing Shen!

26
00:01:50,246 --> 00:01:52,429
I had no idea
it was so staffy

27
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:54,110
- Staffy?
- No way!

28
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:57,456
And the cape master Croc used for...
for...

29
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,753
Well I don't know what he used it for,
but let me tell you something...

30
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:03,603
- It made him look really cool.
- Goodnight Po.

31
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,561
Come on! How can you even 
think of going back to sleeping, 

32
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,275
when we're this close to so much (Gasp)

33
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,669
The sarcophagus of Su Wu!

34
00:02:11,793 --> 00:02:13,055
- Su what?
- Wu.

35
00:02:13,154 --> 00:02:14,137
- Who?
- Su Wu.

36
00:02:14,252 --> 00:02:15,494
- Who's Su?
- No clue.

37
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:19,483
Woah, woah, woah. You haven't heard of
the Wu sisters?

38
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:22,110
They were the most 
feared and notorious villains 

39
00:02:22,222 --> 00:02:24,197
who ever terrorised China.

40
00:02:24,308 --> 00:02:26,476
Oh but they did one good thing.

41
00:02:26,593 --> 00:02:31,648
They brought masters Ox, Croc and Rhino 
together for the very first time.

42
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,697
It all started a long ago
in the city of Jinzhou.

43
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:40,448
You see, not everyone practiced Kung Fu 
for justice and honour.

44
00:02:44,944 --> 00:02:46,198
Good fight, boys.

45
00:02:46,361 --> 00:02:48,946
Glad to see you still have some teeth left, Stanley. 
(Laughs)

46
00:02:51,425 --> 00:02:55,368
Next fight on today's programme is 
the Heavyweights!

47
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,442
Which of you hulking punching bags want in?

48
00:03:00,287 --> 00:03:02,768
The Croc is in!

49
00:03:02,929 --> 00:03:07,480
You can't hide from my impenetrable hide.

50
00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:11,539
The Ox is in.

51
00:03:11,845 --> 00:03:15,174
My uniqueness is to analyze your weakness

52
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:19,794
Bingo!

53
00:03:22,407 --> 00:03:25,426
Ow! My bad ear!
He got my bad ear!

54
00:03:25,851 --> 00:03:29,819
All right!
Let's get this slaughter started!

55
00:03:32,855 --> 00:03:34,586
Not just yet!

56
00:03:34,855 --> 00:03:39,064
Boys, we got ourselves a
three-way battle blowout!

57
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,528
My name is Rhino.

58
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:44,229
My sauce of course is
my unstoppable force.

59
00:03:44,865 --> 00:03:46,444
Who cares who wins?

60
00:03:46,635 --> 00:03:49,782
Those three are a disgrace to Kung Fu.

61
00:03:50,499 --> 00:03:52,729
I fear they will all lose,

62
00:03:52,835 --> 00:03:57,167
until they find a battle worth fighting.

63
00:03:57,467 --> 00:04:01,151
Yeah, hear that all the time.
Did you want to see the dessert menu?

64
00:04:02,544 --> 00:04:06,727
Okay fellows, you know the rules.
Deranged Journey!

65
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,115
Heh hey, look at this.

66
00:04:28,274 --> 00:04:33,240
<i> What the palace guards didn't know was that 
two of the Wu sisters had already escaped their prisons </i>

67
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:37,019
<i> and were planning 
a little family reunion. </i>

68
00:04:52,983 --> 00:04:55,544
Guards!
Attack!

69
00:05:00,078 --> 00:05:02,150
(Gasp) the Wu sisters!

70
00:05:05,545 --> 00:05:10,122
- What was that?
- A battle worth fighting.

71
00:05:14,283 --> 00:05:18,086
Here's your cut for that 
impressive three-way tie.

72
00:05:18,224 --> 00:05:19,819
What?
Not a tie?

73
00:05:19,943 --> 00:05:21,600
- I won that fight fair and square.
- Ha!

74
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:25,183
You must be a comedian 
because that sounded like a joke to me.

75
00:05:25,307 --> 00:05:28,837
Yeah, well laugh it up.
'cause the real joke is your Kung Fu.

76
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:31,835
Everyone knows your daddy 
is a famous Kung Fu master.

77
00:05:31,946 --> 00:05:34,599
But that does not make you a winner.

78
00:05:39,577 --> 00:05:41,946
Ah, I see the fight continues.

79
00:05:42,064 --> 00:05:44,500
(Gasp) a fan!
Let me sign that for you.

80
00:05:44,606 --> 00:05:46,641
And what's your name, little boy?

81
00:05:46,858 --> 00:05:50,406
- My name is Oogway.
- (Gasp) Master Oogway.

82
00:05:50,609 --> 00:05:53,801
Oo-oo-gway?
Is that with two "Oo"s?

83
00:05:54,431 --> 00:05:56,191
Wait a minute!
This looks nothing like me.

84
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:00,062
The Wu sisters?
They once took on the entire Jackal nation

85
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,624
armed with nothing more than 
a pair of chopsticks!

86
00:06:02,766 --> 00:06:06,630
Together? They are more powerful 
than any Kung Fu master.

87
00:06:06,797 --> 00:06:08,413
I thought they were locked up.

88
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:11,886
They were.
Until mere moments ago.

89
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,925
But now they are free.

90
00:06:14,202 --> 00:06:17,530
And I assure you 
they will be seeking revenge.

91
00:06:17,714 --> 00:06:20,992
You three must stop them.

92
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,957
You're not talking about us right?

93
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:27,936
The Wu sisters are headed for their 
fortress inside the Hubei volcano.

94
00:06:28,145 --> 00:06:30,212
Scary, isn't it?

95
00:06:30,396 --> 00:06:34,032
I believe that your unstoppable
force, impenetrable hide

96
00:06:34,192 --> 00:06:38,583
and tactical brilliance are precisely
what we need to capture them.

97
00:06:38,703 --> 00:06:42,742
You know, this all sounds really fun
but what's in it for me?

98
00:06:42,856 --> 00:06:45,344
Yeah, why would we help you?

99
00:06:45,847 --> 00:06:49,945
Bah, because you'll be protecting the innocents from certain delirium.

100
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:52,767
- And?
- And...

101
00:06:53,152 --> 00:06:56,092
Using your skills for a noble purpose.

102
00:06:56,184 --> 00:06:59,796
I can't help but feel 
something is still missing.

103
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:07,666
Because upon completing the mission, 
you'll discover the path to a wealth of riches.

104
00:07:11,712 --> 00:07:12,816
<i> Rhino! </i>

105
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:15,696
I'm proud of you, my son.

106
00:07:15,809 --> 00:07:17,614
(All three) I'm in.


107
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:35,570
Hah, there's no place like fortress.

108
00:07:35,809 --> 00:07:37,181
Now back to business.

109
00:07:37,301 --> 00:07:40,631
Tell us dear sister,
what diabolical plan have you concocted?

110
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,539
Yes, What is our next move?

111
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:47,136
Hmm... while I was locked away, 
I had a revelation.

112
00:07:47,351 --> 00:07:50,952
If all of China's gangs stop fighting
and joined forces,

113
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,861
we can run this country.

114
00:07:52,948 --> 00:07:55,683
And even the Imperial Army 
will be unable to stop us.

115
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:59,273
- (Gasp) A criminal syndicate
- Precisely

116
00:08:00,092 --> 00:08:04,240
We will send a message to 
the heads of all the evil clans.

117
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:10,329
I am calling a meeting at 
Wu's fortress in two days.

118
00:08:10,697 --> 00:08:14,025
The topic of discussion will be 
the joining of villainous forces

119
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:18,709
for a total control of China, 
once and for all! (Laughs)

120
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:30,337
<i>So the three went off with Oogway
to find the riches they were after.</i>

121
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,239
<i>They boldly pass through fire lake</i>

122
00:08:34,822 --> 00:08:37,627
<i>Mightily treks through the forest of pain</i>

123
00:08:38,199 --> 00:08:41,224
<i>Stopped for a pinic lunch at 
the jagged cliffs of death</i>

124
00:08:42,082 --> 00:08:44,557
<i>Ploughed through the fields of cherry blossoms</i>

125
00:08:44,701 --> 00:08:47,329
<i>which would have been a much better place for lunch</i>

126
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:50,013
<i>And bounded across the bamboo forest</i>

127
00:08:50,178 --> 00:08:52,278
<i>each fighter only out for himself</i>

128
00:08:53,873 --> 00:08:55,726
- My friend, I have a proposition.
- Is that so?

129
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:57,348
I propose...

130
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,078
We don't need these guys.
Hold that thought.

131
00:09:00,255 --> 00:09:01,281
- Hello.
- Hello.

132
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:03,584
We don't need those two.
I say we dump the baggage.

133
00:09:04,092 --> 00:09:06,136
Hey, I can see my swamp from here...
(falls)

134
00:09:06,356 --> 00:09:08,734
I'll give you a tenth of the take.
It's generous, I know.

135
00:09:08,957 --> 00:09:11,256
- Ox offered a third.
- (Gasp)

136
00:09:11,398 --> 00:09:13,201
- I'm back - I'll give you half
- Oh no, not again.

137
00:09:13,308 --> 00:09:15,524
- Okay, Let us cut to the chase.
- I could take care...

138
00:09:15,616 --> 00:09:16,755
- of the Wu sisters
- all by

139
00:09:16,861 --> 00:09:19,880
- Myself!
(thud)

140
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:29,385
And then Croc will buy a castle 
with a rooftop balcony

141
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:31,846
where I can wave to my adoring fans

142
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:33,827
wearing all my capes. 
(falls)

143
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:40,403
It's so nice to see you've managed to take 
the most respected art form in China 

144
00:09:40,565 --> 00:09:43,270
and use it to pursue nothing but fame.

145
00:09:43,427 --> 00:09:46,094
And fortune.
Don't forget about the fortune.

146
00:09:46,242 --> 00:09:48,851
Then I can quit wasting 
my time on street fighting

147
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,608
And spend it counting my money.

148
00:09:50,692 --> 00:09:53,338
Oh, yes.
I like the money.

149
00:09:54,141 --> 00:09:57,319
- And what about you, Rhino?
- Uh...

150
00:09:57,462 --> 00:09:59,534
I'm in it for my own reasons, so just...

151
00:09:59,651 --> 00:10:01,874
Let's leave it at that, okay?

152
00:10:02,032 --> 00:10:04,584
Ah, yes. Your father.

153
00:10:04,874 --> 00:10:08,121
It must be hard being the son
of a Kung Fu master.

154
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:11,130
I know how you can all get
what you want.

155
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:13,489
Not just fame and fortune.

156
00:10:14,282 --> 00:10:18,181
- And how's that?
- By changing course.

157
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:25,300
When the path you walk always leads back
to yourself, you'll never get anywhere.

158
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:28,364
Well, goodnight.
We've got a big day tomorrow.

159
00:10:28,474 --> 00:10:31,726
That was the worst Kung Fu
story I've ever heard.

160
00:10:31,953 --> 00:10:34,562
No time for sleep!
We leave for the fortress at once!

161
00:10:34,678 --> 00:10:36,207
Wait, what?
Why?

162
00:10:36,353 --> 00:10:37,825
Didn't you just say "goodnight"?

163
00:10:38,014 --> 00:10:42,128
The Wu sisters are unifying all 
the gangleaders to lay siege on China.

164
00:10:42,326 --> 00:10:45,417
- And how do you know this?
- A little birdie told me.

165
00:10:46,304 --> 00:10:47,740
Hey, how's it going?

166
00:10:49,701 --> 00:10:51,865
Let's go then!

167
00:10:54,617 --> 00:10:58,610
So, Oogway.
Do we have any sort of... plan?

168
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,507
- I do.
- Oh you do, well great!

169
00:11:00,643 --> 00:11:02,887
You think you might wanna 
share it with the rest of us?

170
00:11:02,986 --> 00:11:04,690
I don't.

171
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,130
The bridge of mists.

172
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,741
Er... that's deep.

173
00:11:13,024 --> 00:11:17,207
Erm... Okay. How do we get across?

174
00:11:17,438 --> 00:11:19,251
By working together.

175
00:11:19,336 --> 00:11:21,905
I don't know what's in that green head of yours
but there is no way we're gonna get... (flies)

176
00:11:27,715 --> 00:11:30,592
(Gasp) What's wrong with you?
I knew we shouldn't have trusted him!

177
00:11:30,739 --> 00:11:32,281
Wow! What was that for?

178
00:11:32,366 --> 00:11:33,451
We must get across.

179
00:11:33,566 --> 00:11:36,064
And your solution is to 
hurl us to our deaths?

180
00:11:36,358 --> 00:11:37,957
(Sniggers) Not exacly.

181
00:11:44,687 --> 00:11:46,396
Ah oh! Bad turtle, bad turtle!

182
00:11:46,524 --> 00:11:48,327
Stay away from me!

183
00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:51,809
And where are you going?

184
00:11:57,781 --> 00:12:02,711
Uh, excuse me! But how exactly
does this help us get across?

185
00:12:03,249 --> 00:12:07,108
It doesn't.
It helps me.

186
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:14,322
And by helping me,
you help yourself.

187
00:12:16,565 --> 00:12:17,953
Wow...

188
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,059
Not quite time to celebrate yet.

189
00:12:28,356 --> 00:12:33,709
The most treacherous part of 
the journey lies just ahead.

190
00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:47,322
Isn't there like a back door or 
something to this fortress?

191
00:12:47,474 --> 00:12:49,260
My leg!
Something's got my leg!

192
00:12:49,411 --> 00:12:51,556
- Oh no, that's just me.
- Oh...

193
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:55,717
I got you.

194
00:12:58,013 --> 00:12:59,801
Oh, this mountain she's impossible.

195
00:12:59,851 --> 00:13:01,209
Yeah, no kidding.

196
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:06,070
I mean it's hard enough climbing up here,
how are we suppose to get back down carrying our riches?

197
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:11,382
Ooh, I think you will find that the riches 
awaiting you will lighten your burden.

198
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:15,150
- Oh, it's paper money, got it.
- Well I never said money.

199
00:13:15,265 --> 00:13:20,014
- You did!
- I said riches, as in emotional riches.

200
00:13:20,663 --> 00:13:22,312
We've been conned.

201
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:24,398
My father always said
"Never trust a turtle."

202
00:13:24,438 --> 00:13:26,011
Wait a second.
No money?

203
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,236
That's the only reason 
we followed you.

204
00:13:28,337 --> 00:13:30,705
- Was it?
- Hold it shelly...

205
00:13:33,827 --> 00:13:34,853
No!

206
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:36,589
Help!

207
00:13:55,249 --> 00:13:57,598
Remember the path.

208
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:06,626
Oogway!
No!

209
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,831
Where do we go from here?

210
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:47,502
We retrace our steps and 
find our way home, I guess.

211
00:14:49,126 --> 00:14:51,875
But Oogway said
"Remember the path."

212
00:14:52,046 --> 00:14:55,522
Yeah, the path back home.
Face it, Rhino.

213
00:14:55,647 --> 00:14:58,529
We'll never be more than a bunch 
of lousy street fighters.

214
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,946
He's right!
We couldn't beat each other up

215
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,032
let alone the Wu sisters?

216
00:15:03,146 --> 00:15:06,181
I say we go back down 
before it gets too dark.

217
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,034
You coming?

218
00:15:49,472 --> 00:15:54,618
Are they gone? The Wu sisters, they... 
they took everything.

219
00:15:55,797 --> 00:15:58,379
- Are you here to save us?
- You misunderstand.

220
00:15:58,508 --> 00:16:00,378
- We are sorry but...
- Please help us.

221
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:01,880
We can't help you.

222
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,868
You fight for money, right?

223
00:16:13,502 --> 00:16:16,936
No, we fight for honour.

224
00:16:23,969 --> 00:16:26,688
It's time to change course!

225
00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:33,826
And with our forces combined, 
we can take control of China

226
00:16:33,947 --> 00:16:36,189
village by village!

227
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,443
Game's over, Kitties.

228
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,049
We're gonna put your tails 
back in jail.

229
00:16:46,983 --> 00:16:51,061
Hmm... the street fighters?
I watched you from my cell.

230
00:16:51,201 --> 00:16:54,396
How much is the Imperial Army 
paying you to arrest us?

231
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:57,180
Why does everyone think 
we only do things for money?

232
00:16:57,465 --> 00:16:58,784
Because you're do.

233
00:16:58,904 --> 00:17:01,011
No, we did.

234
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:07,047
So much for combining forces.

235
00:17:07,421 --> 00:17:08,822
Sisters!

236
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,025
It is no use.
They have too much power.

237
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:30,261
Than one of us, yes.
But together?

238
00:17:30,877 --> 00:17:32,979
Ox, do your thing!

239
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,473
Bingo!

240
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,771
Their connection!
It's the source of their power!

241
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:42,966
We have to break them apart.

242
00:17:43,076 --> 00:17:45,425
They are spinning too fast
I can't get a clear shot!

243
00:17:45,528 --> 00:17:47,658
Then Croc is in!

244
00:17:52,837 --> 00:17:54,488
Ow, it's getting hot!

245
00:17:54,734 --> 00:17:58,554
- That way, that way!
- Ooh my tail, she's on fire!

246
00:17:58,951 --> 00:18:00,578
Rhino, we need a bullseye

247
00:18:00,692 --> 00:18:02,179
I'm way ahead of ya!

248
00:18:22,647 --> 00:18:24,919
- Woohoo, yeah!
- You guys are great!

249
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:26,327
<i>Well done</i>

250
00:18:26,527 --> 00:18:29,200
- Woah, woah?
- I'm not the only one hearing this, right?

251
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:32,568
<i>I see you found the
battle worth fighting</i>

252
00:18:32,686 --> 00:18:34,838
It's a sign.
What does it mean?

253
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:37,012
It means I'm right behind you.

254
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,246
What?

255
00:18:38,746 --> 00:18:41,238
Master Oogway!
You're alive!

256
00:18:41,518 --> 00:18:44,032
But we saw you fall to your death.

257
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,829
No, you saw me fall.

258
00:18:47,062 --> 00:18:50,627
So, did you find the riches
you were seeking?

259
00:18:51,328 --> 00:18:53,566
You know, I think we did.

260
00:18:54,326 --> 00:18:56,534
I never doubted you would.

261
00:18:57,546 --> 00:19:00,453
Your father will be proud

262
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,704
as am I.

263
00:19:05,114 --> 00:19:06,694
Come on, right?

264
00:19:06,868 --> 00:19:08,898
How great a story is that?

265
00:19:09,037 --> 00:19:10,872
The path Oogway set them on eventually

266
00:19:10,944 --> 00:19:13,708
led them to Gongmen city,
where they formed the Masters' Council.

267
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,617
You see, the soothsayer had predicted...

268
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:17,679
Er... Po, we were there.

269
00:19:17,946 --> 00:19:21,073
Woah! Look at the Shifu exhibit!

270
00:19:21,254 --> 00:19:24,528
It's so lifelike you could almost 
feel the anger coming out of him.

271
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:26,899
- Ahem 
- Oh, Master Shifu!

272
00:19:27,064 --> 00:19:28,526
What are you doing here?

273
00:19:28,656 --> 00:19:31,154
Er... I couldn't wait for the museum to open...

274
00:19:32,935 --> 00:19:34,834
Hmm... 
You two may go.

275
00:19:34,991 --> 00:19:39,480
The door was locked so I found...
you know, another way in.

276
00:19:39,948 --> 00:19:41,943
- Here.
- The blade of Bao Ding!

277
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:44,602
Master Eagle used it against the Hyenas of Hun Dun!

278
00:19:44,729 --> 00:19:47,636
- It's not the blade of Bao Ding.
- It's the dagger of Deng Wa.

279
00:19:47,774 --> 00:19:51,207
- It is not the dagger of Deng Wa.
- The shank of Shang Tu?

280
00:19:51,436 --> 00:19:53,379
- It's a trowel.
- Used by?

281
00:19:53,503 --> 00:19:56,864
You, to repair the hole 
you made in my ceiling.

282
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,379
Door's open in twenty minutes.

283
00:20:00,178 --> 00:20:01,973
Don't disappoint me.

284
00:20:03,496 --> 00:20:05,449
Twenty minutes.
I can do this.

285
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,305
I can do this!
I have the skills.

286
00:20:07,423 --> 00:20:10,090
The moves! 
I can patch the most ruthless of ceilings.

287
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,265
The deadliest of tiles.

288
00:20:14,873 --> 00:20:17,546
Shifu?
Shifu

289
00:20:18,063 --> 00:20:19,730
Shifu!

290
00:20:20,115 --> 00:20:21,833
Is there a security man?

291
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,087
Help!

292
00:20:24,846 --> 00:20:26,989
Well, at least I can get 
a nice power nap in here...

293
00:20:28,988 --> 00:20:31,317
(snores) Nice cream won ton soup...

294
00:20:33,118 --> 00:20:36,036
(snores) Monkey ate my homework...

295
00:20:37,372 --> 00:20:39,369
(snores) Sweet and sour (inaudible)...

296
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:45,795
