1
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:23,691
(Horns honking)

2
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:28,028
(Radio tuning)

3
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:31,599
[Radio] Laughter
is a sin around here.

4
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:32,800
You know why?

5
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,069
Because laughter
can mean happiness

6
00:00:35,103 --> 00:00:38,206
And I want you
boys to always know

7
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,943
Happiness don't exist for you.

8
00:00:44,112 --> 00:00:47,081
It exists for the
privileged, for the loved.

9
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:52,253
The world outside
don't care about you!

10
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,723
So laughing is just pretending.

11
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:57,958
And if they make believe
over here, uh-uh.

12
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,460
This here is a home
for the wayward,

13
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:02,430
For the orphaned,
for the discarded.

14
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:07,401
I am setting you up to succeed.

15
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:11,705
Because y'all too stupid
to know the truth.

16
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:15,008
And you'll thank me for this
when you get old enough, okay?

17
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:19,480
Believe me, you'll thank me
for telling you the truth.

18
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:21,849
(Horses whinny)

19
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:29,123
My hates have a tendency
to move around, you know?

20
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:31,625
I hate that I'm losing
this game of cards.

21
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:33,361
I hate you asking me questions.

22
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:35,696
Frank Stone?

23
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,166
I neither hate him
nor like him.

24
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:41,101
I'm a professional headmaster.

25
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:42,603
I'm objective.

26
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,071
I'm not a homosexual.

27
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,006
I'm a pedophile.

28
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:49,943
It's different, okay?

29
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:51,979
I teach them boys who they are.

30
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,949
So society wants to kill it.

31
00:01:57,385 --> 00:01:58,819
These boys up here,
who do they got?

32
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:01,689
Ain't nobody, just
each other, just boys.

33
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:03,457
They gotta learn how
to love each other.

34
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:05,826
So I teach 'em how.

35
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,262
I don't mess with old men.

36
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:09,663
I'm married.

37
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:13,066
It's degenerate.

38
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,303
Outside the bounds.

39
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:16,470
He's on the other
side of the street.

40
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:17,871
I'm walking down
the street, right?

41
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:18,939
Right street.

42
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,374
He's across the street.

43
00:02:20,408 --> 00:02:22,075
Always has been.

44
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:26,180
(Radio static)

45
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:30,951
Working for the mob.

46
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,286
Who does he think
he is, Al Capone?

47
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,090
(Suspenseful music)

48
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:03,944
(Screams)

49
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:09,617
(Screams louder)

50
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,589
[Wife] No, no!

51
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:20,027
(Screams) No, no!

52
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,995
[Frank] Knock it off.

53
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:22,763
(Crying)

54
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,765
I said knock it off.

55
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:27,868
(Panicked crying)

56
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,972
I got it open.

57
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:36,043
[Frank] Get the merchandise.

58
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:40,047
(Heavy breathing)

59
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:51,825
(Engine roars)

60
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:55,529
[Frank] Slow down.

61
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:58,165
You can get the
cops on a day off.

62
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,748
Listen to me, you
stupid jerk-off.

63
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:17,985
You're not my boss, so
don't talk to me like that.

64
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:20,888
If I want to get some action
off some brawd, I will, okay?

65
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,322
That's my business.

66
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:24,024
I thought you acted
inappropriately.

67
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,427
Were you tryin' to get
us popped for rape?

68
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,128
Next time, I'll
just fuckin' kill...

69
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,963
[Safecracker] Whoa!

70
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,738
[Frank] You should have
kept a better class of friend.

71
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,206
(Gunshot)

72
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:52,553
(TV plays)

73
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:23,016
[Radio] I see the
frustration of sin!

74
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,955
I feel the frustration of sin.

75
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:30,624
Let me tell you, if
you don't already know.

76
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:33,927
Sin is the apple that's
put in front of the horse.

77
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:38,298
It was the apple presented
to Eve in the garden of Eden.

78
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,601
And it's the apple
of my eye when I see

79
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:43,471
That nice little
rump on all of you.

80
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:46,006
It's mine to take!

81
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,441
I'm headmaster.

82
00:06:47,475 --> 00:06:50,177
That's, like, God.

83
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,213
That's, like, the
final say, okay?

84
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,248
(Laughs)

85
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:59,720
I take, I give, my surrender.

86
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,590
But make no mistake!

87
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:05,859
It's still me and not you.

88
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:08,896
None of you have a
claim or say.

89
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,431
I am the last word.

90
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:13,133
Okay?

91
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:19,339
(Sirens wail)

92
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:23,276
(Horn honks)

93
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,945
(Phone rings)

94
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,317
(Phone rings)

95
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:35,355
(Phone rings)

96
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,628
(Phone rings)

97
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,032
(Phone rings)

98
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,236
[Man on phone] Hey Frank?

99
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,704
[Frank] Yeah.

100
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:51,972
[Man on phone] The boss
wants to see you tomorrow.

101
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,473
Understand?

102
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:04,585
(Children laughing)

103
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,204
[Vinny] Let's
not talk about it.

104
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,205
Hooked on that shit?

105
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,407
It's in their veins.

106
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,276
[Man in yellow] That's like
that energy drink, right?

107
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:32,045
It's their methedrine,
their methedrine.

108
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:33,581
The first energy drink ever.

109
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:35,583
Man, their first guy's
talking shit all the time.

110
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:36,650
Hey, Bud, are you in?

111
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:38,518
Hey, Frank, how're you doing?

112
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:41,021
Sit down, sit down.

113
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,923
What do you have for me?

114
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:48,896
A pretty nice haul.

115
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:50,998
Whoa!

116
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,107
Nice.

117
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,309
Real nice.

118
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,045
Clean job as always?

119
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:06,179
A couple of bumps
in the road,

120
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:09,116
But I paved them
over, as always.

121
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,450
[Tony] Yeah, I heard.

122
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,820
You know, you're one
coldhearted sonofabitch, Frank.

123
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:15,222
Took out his own guy.

124
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:20,360
You know, you remind me
of this bedtime story

125
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,363
That my father,
God bless his soul,

126
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,832
That he used to
read to me as a kid.

127
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:27,134
It was about an evil
bastard, just like Frank.

128
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,136
I'm tellin' ya.

129
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,237
Frank, did your
father ever used

130
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,139
To read you bedtime stories?

131
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:35,175
(Guys laugh)

132
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,911
I never knew my ol' man,
Tony.

133
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:39,246
Oh, I'm sorry,
Frank, I didn't know.

134
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,548
I didn't know, Frank.

135
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,150
Give him his money.

136
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:47,087
The money!

137
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:51,424
[Vinny] Okay, Frank,
here's your money.

138
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,527
Thanks, Tony.

139
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:56,496
[Vinny] Hey, Frank, I
got a question for you.

140
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,399
Now that you got all those
fazool's in your pocket,

141
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,601
Which one of your brawd's
you gonna take out?

142
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:04,437
(Laughing)

143
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:07,540
Maybe take a shower...

144
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,977
Take her to Paris, some
place more high end,

145
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:14,014
Romantic like Coney
Island for a hot date.

146
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:18,318
Did you need
anything else, Tony?

147
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,219
[Tony] No, that's it.

148
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:20,020
Thanks, Frank.

149
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:22,022
Good work, good work.

150
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,926
Have a nice day, fellas.

151
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,796
Yeah, take it easy, handsome.

152
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:31,031
What you guys
break his balls for?

153
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:32,232
He's a fern.

154
00:10:32,265 --> 00:10:33,366
Alright, come on,
let's play cards.

155
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,568
Come on, come on, come on.

156
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:39,139
(Melancholy music)

157
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,442
(Whip snaps)

158
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:19,212
(Children laughing)

159
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:21,815
(Horses whinny)

160
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:30,690
Long, long time ago...

161
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,860
Long time ago!

162
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:37,497
You know, man figured out...

163
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,668
Animal skin, beneficial to 'em.

164
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,570
Good thing.

165
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:49,609
Now, like this here, keep
ya warm in the winter.

166
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,178
Dry in the summer.

167
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,479
My happy thing.

168
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:54,281
Animal skin.

169
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,921
Like this belt here, see?

170
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:03,090
It's leather, animal skin.

171
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:04,257
But there's many
different functions.

172
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,927
There's holding my
pants, you know?

173
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:10,597
Tie a woman down and shoot.

174
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,801
Be a good thing, too,
sometimes.

175
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:15,803
Depends on the girl.

176
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:18,538
Those women are hard to...

177
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:22,075
Hard to figure them out
sometimes, you know?

178
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:26,179
(Spits) It's romantic.

179
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:30,283
Hit 'em for the
punishment and...

180
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:31,985
You know, wrap it around
your hand like this

181
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:34,021
Or on your fist like this.

182
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,957
Bam!

183
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,026
No more problem.

184
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:41,661
That man go down.

185
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,596
It's going down!

186
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:53,706
Turn around, now.

187
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,375
Turn around!

188
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:03,583
Grab your ankles.

189
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:09,890
But you don't listen.

190
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:14,394
Now I'm gonna fix your
radio, I'll teach ya.

191
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:17,797
I'm using this belt as,
alright?

192
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:21,034
And this is a
romantic use for it.

193
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:27,107
(Leaves rustling)

194
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:45,158
Some place this was.

195
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:47,995
It's a good thing
they closed it.

196
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:50,097
It was horribly run.

197
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:56,970
Those poor boys, they use
them like punching bags.

198
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:59,839
That's what I heard.

199
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,844
It's a good thing we
didn't go there, huh?

200
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:09,749
(Menacing music)

201
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,282
Hey, you better hurry up.

202
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:45,152
Class starts in a few minutes.

203
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,554
What?

204
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:51,824
Oh, I thought you were in
my Creative Writing class.

205
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,162
Sorry.

206
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:08,375
Dominic was loaded, as usual.

207
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,809
He loved to drink,
which was a good thing

208
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,744
Because at this point,
he had to drink.

209
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,580
If he didn't start his
day by rolling out of bed

210
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,715
And crawling to the freezer
for a few shots of vodka,

211
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,817
His hands would shake and
he'd start to feel sick.

212
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,953
And he'd become as manic
as a mental patient.

213
00:15:19,987 --> 00:15:20,887
But what are you gonna do?

214
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,688
Everybody's got their cross...

215
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,223
(Elevator bell dings)

216
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,398
Dominic was a drunk and
would always be a drunk,

217
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,033
But he was okay with that.

218
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:34,434
He was the heartbreakingly
tragic figure

219
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,536
He always wanted to be,
but with an abdominal sense

220
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:38,771
Of human that made
him borderline heroic

221
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:39,706
In his own mind.

222
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:41,308
Sure, he was destined
to crash and burn.

223
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:43,510
But it was going to be
epic, if not entertaining.

224
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,645
He had already come
close to cashing in once.

225
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,480
Couple of winters back,
he was found passed out

226
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,116
In his boxer shorts in
the boulevard during

227
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,118
A failed attempt to
get to a liquor store.

228
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:53,720
He spent the next five
weeks in the hospital.

229
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:56,023
Initially, the doctors didn't
give him much of a chance.

230
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:57,357
Dominic's liver was shot.

231
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,292
He was completely
yellow with jaundice.

232
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:02,295
His skin was yellow, the
whites of his eyes were yellow,

233
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:03,997
If he had been wearing
a top hat and a monocle,

234
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:05,298
He could have passed
for Mr. Peanut,

235
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:07,000
But somehow he survived.

236
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:08,235
Supposedly, the
liver is a highly

237
00:16:08,268 --> 00:16:10,303
Regenerative organ,
or so they told him.

238
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:11,904
The doctors lectured
Dominic about how he

239
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:13,873
Was being given a second
chance to live and how he

240
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,575
Needed to make some serious
lifestyle changes...

241
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:19,012
Alright, thank you,
thank you, Bradford.

242
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:23,216
Anybody have any questions
for Bradford, class?

243
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,451
Yes, Ackley?

244
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,354
It didn't do anything for me.

245
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:28,388
Okay, okay...

246
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:30,390
[Ackley] I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

247
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,692
If that's what you
felt, that's okay.

248
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,594
Did't do, yeah, I'm sorry.

249
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,563
[Mr. Benson] Okay, no,
if that's how you felt...

250
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:41,568
Yeah, I just feel like
it just lacked emotion.

251
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:43,803
[Mr. Benson] Yes, Jackie?

252
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,405
I have something, Mr. Benson.

253
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,607
Okay, Jackie, go ahead.

254
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,876
[Jackie] Okay (Laughs).

255
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,178
Alright.

256
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:54,314
Alright, Jackie, go ahead.

257
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:59,486
Okay, okay, sorry, okay.

258
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,920
He never stayed long.

259
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:01,821
Never.

260
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,022
He liked Rosemary's company,

261
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:04,957
But always seemed
to be in a hurry,

262
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:06,893
Like if he had a duel
life or something.

263
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:08,495
But Rosemary didn't mind.

264
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,829
She was lonely.

265
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,031
And lonely women cry at night.

266
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:13,566
Rosemary got sick of it.

267
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,001
That's why she wore
her fancy bottle

268
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,437
Of perfume and best dress.

269
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,839
She wanted him to caress
her like a mink coat.

270
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,774
But it didn't happen this time.

271
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:24,377
Rosemary wept after he left.

272
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:25,778
She thought about
swallowing that whole

273
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:28,348
Bottle of pills,
but decided not to.

274
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,782
She didn't want any
man thinking

275
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:32,018
Someone killed
themselves for him.

276
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,755
Rosemary, instead, painted
a horizon on a canvas.

277
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,758
It seemed brighter
than her future.

278
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,895
You alright, Jackie?

279
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:46,466
[Jackie] Yeah, no, I
just get nervous sometimes.

280
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:49,001
Okay, what do you
call this story?

281
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:50,403
[Jackie] Oh, God.

282
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:54,741
I guess I would call it
"The Girl in Apartment 3J".

283
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:58,378
[Mr. Benson]
Alright, does anybody

284
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,880
Have any questions for Jackie?

285
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:03,650
Yes Ackley?

286
00:18:03,683 --> 00:18:05,285
[Ackley] Yes, I was
wondering how long

287
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:07,086
We're gonna have
to hear about these

288
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,888
Desperate characters of yours.

289
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:12,759
The same characters from the
last story that you brought in.

290
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:13,960
I mean, when are
we going to hear

291
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:15,862
Something good for a
change, something...

292
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:16,629
What?

293
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,498
With more levels.

294
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:21,268
More, I want more.

295
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:23,436
I'm so sorry, Mr.
Herman Melville.

296
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,439
[Ackley] I wouldn't be
caught dead reading Melville.

297
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:27,774
Excuse me, Ackley?

298
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:30,042
Ackley, we could
do without that.

299
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:33,846
Well, the whole function of
this creative writing class

300
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,785
Is to learn and
experience and to grow.

301
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,287
[Ackley] I, yeah, I...

302
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,988
We do not need to
criticize to

303
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:44,757
The extent that you take it to.

304
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,159
- [Ackley] Oh...
- [Mr. Benson] Jackie?

305
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:48,695
What do you, what were
you feeling when you

306
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:51,198
Wrote this particular
passage to your story?

307
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:55,735
"The Lonely Girl
in Apartment 3F"

308
00:18:55,768 --> 00:19:00,707
No, it was "The
Girl in Apartment 3J".

309
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,808
But I like that.

310
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:05,245
"The Lonely Girl
in Apartment 3F"

311
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:09,115
But, she's afraid
of being an old maid

312
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,418
And all her friends
are wondering...

313
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:13,853
Okay, Jackie,
thank you, thank you.

314
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:17,590
Does anybody else have
anything they'd like to read?

315
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:18,758
No?

316
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:20,760
I would like to read...

317
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:21,994
[Mr. Benson] Yes, Ackley?

318
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:23,196
I would like to read
my piece for the class.

319
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,498
[Mr. Benson] Can
you make it quick?

320
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:27,133
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

321
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,736
So, this is an ongoing...

322
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,272
This is part of a trilogy.

323
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:34,774
You speak of one and...

324
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:38,110
[Mr. Benson] Okay,
alright, class dismissed!

325
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,953
(Sirens wailing)

326
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:58,097
[Radio] Frank!

327
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,566
Frank!

328
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:02,235
(Laughing) Frank!

329
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:04,036
You listening to me?

330
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,273
I know you hear me.

331
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:08,908
I know you hear me.

332
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,911
(Laughs)

333
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:49,449
(Engine revs)

334
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:50,517
(Horses whinny)

335
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,384
(Whip snaps)

336
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:55,021
(Children laugh)

337
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:00,259
(Whip snaps)

338
00:21:10,337 --> 00:21:14,974
There are certain
things in life.

339
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:15,908
There are certain
things that are

340
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,944
Passed down in life, you know?

341
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:20,079
Like father and son.

342
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:23,416
In our case...

343
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:29,088
Headmaster to a...

344
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:36,195
Orphan.

345
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:43,536
Like the love of huntin'.

346
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,405
Yeah, killin'!

347
00:21:45,438 --> 00:21:47,206
(Laughs) That was a good one.

348
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,776
That was a good one.

349
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:52,244
Fishin'?

350
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:53,279
Fishin'?

351
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,315
Yeah, fishin' will work.

352
00:21:56,349 --> 00:22:00,887
Yep, today, though, I'm
gonna do some new tradition.

353
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,355
From a long line of traditions

354
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:05,425
Between a headmaster
and orphan.

355
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:08,961
That's called sharing
a bottle of bourbon.

356
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,797
It's good.

357
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,732
Good for ya.

358
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:16,202
It's good, you know, I mean...

359
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:19,305
Take your mind off
of things that...

360
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:24,310
You know, get your mind off
of things that bother ya.

361
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,915
About yourself and stuff.

362
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:31,050
Purify your soul!

363
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:34,153
Got one.

364
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:36,022
What do you think
them priests be

365
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:37,356
Doing in church with
their wine?

366
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,158
Drunk.

367
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:47,033
Want a taste?

368
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:49,869
Here, here, have a taste.

369
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:55,608
I said to have a taste.

370
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:59,512
Here, go on.

371
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:03,950
There you go.

372
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:05,852
Not too strong, huh?

373
00:23:06,653 --> 00:23:07,987
Too strong?

374
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,823
Whoa, hey, that's enough there.

375
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:13,125
Come on, give it back.

376
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:14,994
Give it back, it's mine.

377
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:17,730
It's mine, give it back!

378
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,202
It's a gift.

379
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,005
It's a gift to you, it's mine.

380
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:32,244
(Grumbles)

381
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:41,688
Take your pants off.

382
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:46,693
(Sirens wail)

383
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:06,412
Yes, may I help you?

384
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:10,817
I would like to take your
creative writing class.

385
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,719
Great.

386
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:14,386
Have a seat.

387
00:24:17,223 --> 00:24:18,525
[Frank] Thanks.

388
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:21,828
Is there any
particular reason you'd

389
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:23,663
Like to join my
creative writing class?

390
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:25,331
No.

391
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:26,966
Well have you ever
written anything before?

392
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:28,467
No.

393
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:29,368
Nothing?

394
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:32,505
No poetry or news articles?

395
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:37,544
Okay, name?

396
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:42,381
Oscar.

397
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,183
Oscar.

398
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:45,484
Kissel.

399
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:47,153
Okay.

400
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:49,088
Oscar.

401
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,258
A lot of people have come
in here like yourself

402
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:56,763
That they have a lot to express
and they don't know how.

403
00:24:56,796 --> 00:25:00,499
Creative writing will
help you with all of that.

404
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:01,901
I'm gonna give
you an assignment.

405
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:04,203
I want you to go home
and write about something

406
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:10,076
You know or like, but
make it fictitious.

407
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:12,845
If you like flying
on planes, write

408
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:15,114
A story about an airline pilot.

409
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:18,350
Or if you like walking
in the park on Sundays,

410
00:25:18,384 --> 00:25:20,019
Write a story about
a softball player

411
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:22,889
That does well in
that park on Sundays.

412
00:25:22,922 --> 00:25:25,424
Whatever it is,
do it thoroughly.

413
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,594
Get into details.

414
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:29,428
I want you to make
our class believe

415
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,898
In your character,
that it's real.

416
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:35,201
And then we'll feel for them
in their problems, okay?

417
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,138
Softball player?

418
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:42,308
(Typewriter clicking)

419
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:25,051
(Radio static)

420
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:29,956
[Radio] Goddammit, Frank!

421
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:32,058
Didn't that sweet ass you
got for a creative writing

422
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:35,194
Teacher tell you to write
about stuff you know?

423
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:40,399
Well, you know about the darker
things in life, don't ya?

424
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,601
So write about that!

425
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:47,473
Now get back on that
typewriter.

426
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:51,310
And write about that, you
mangy looking bastard.

427
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,283
Come on, I learned
you better than that!

428
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:59,218
Go.

429
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,824
(Intense music)

430
00:27:42,762 --> 00:27:46,799
The night never knew a
shade darker than his soul.

431
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:50,002
That's what everybody used
to say about Frank Stone.

432
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:53,840
Like a clap of thunder, he
was brought into the world,

433
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:57,143
And like a flash of
lightning, he lived.

434
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:01,981
And that was pulling
off jewelry jobs.

435
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:05,551
It was his vice.

436
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:08,420
It gave him comfort, control.

437
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:13,459
And he would stop at
nothing to get it done.

438
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:14,660
Nothing.

439
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:18,330
He was as serious
as a heart attack.

440
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:21,000
(Horses whinny)

441
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,602
(Children laughing)

442
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:32,278
(Typewriter clicking)

443
00:28:38,985 --> 00:28:43,055
But how can one live when
laughter can't sooth their soul
?

444
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:48,460
Frank knew he was dead
inside, born dead.

445
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:53,099
Didn't understand why.

446
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:55,201
Only certain things
made sense to him.

447
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,369
Like being found in a
dumpster on Christmas Eve,

448
00:28:57,403 --> 00:29:01,007
With the umbilical cord
wrapped around his neck.

449
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,641
No.

450
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:05,778
That can't be good.

451
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:08,848
That was clear.

452
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:12,384
That's exactly what the
syndicate looks for, too.

453
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:13,953
Men with rage.

454
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:17,189
Frank was the most comfortable
in this kind of environment.

455
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:20,092
So was his boss,
Tough Tony Forte.

456
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:22,929
A local punk gangster
with a long arm,

457
00:29:22,962 --> 00:29:24,630
Who always gave Frank work...

458
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:27,333
Whenever the need
would arise.

459
00:29:27,366 --> 00:29:28,767
And fortunately for
Frank, that need

460
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:31,570
Came about on a regular basis.

461
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,040
He couldn't wait
to get that call.

462
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:37,276
It's the only time Frank
seemed to come alive.

463
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:39,979
That was just the way
things were in his world.

464
00:29:40,012 --> 00:29:42,581
Hard, cold.

465
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,051
That was Frank Stone.

466
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:47,553
That's all I got so far.

467
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:50,222
Thank you, Oscar,
that was interesting.

468
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:55,461
Does anybody here have
any questions for Oscar?

469
00:29:58,197 --> 00:29:59,932
Yes Ackley?

470
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:02,634
I'm sorry, but
that sounded like a

471
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:05,872
Gangster movie from the
1940's or something.

472
00:30:05,905 --> 00:30:08,941
It was like just
so totally fake.

473
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:12,611
And, like, no one in real
life sounds like Frank Stone.

474
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,214
Except, since World
War II or something.

475
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:17,649
[Mr. Benson] Philip
Ackley, once again,

476
00:30:17,683 --> 00:30:20,652
We are not here to judge.

477
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:23,555
We are here to
analyze and interpret.

478
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:28,895
Does anybody else have
any questions for Oscar?

479
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:30,662
Yes, Jackie.

480
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,765
Well, I thought it was good.

481
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:35,968
I really liked it.

482
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:39,705
It reminded me of one
of those crime novels.

483
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:40,907
You know what I'm
talking about?

484
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,774
Like they sell in
the bus depots.

485
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:44,576
You know, those things
that they're supposed to

486
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:49,781
Take your mind off the
journey you're about to go on.

487
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:51,317
I love those things.

488
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,786
I was once on this bus trip
from Virginia to New Mexico...

489
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,788
Yes, yeah, thank you.

490
00:30:56,822 --> 00:30:58,057
Thank you, Jackie.

491
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:01,193
Does anybody else have
any questions for Oscar?

492
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:05,164
Okay, it not, well
class dismissed.

493
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:09,635
(Phone rings)

494
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:14,941
(Phone rings)

495
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:19,979
(Phone rings)

496
00:31:23,015 --> 00:31:24,150
[Tony] Hey Frank?

497
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:25,517
Yeah?

498
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:28,020
[Tony] You can go ahead
with that operation.

499
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:34,393
[Frank] The Grobe brothers.

500
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:36,828
Vic and Ronnie, I presume.

501
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:38,897
[Vic] We're here.

502
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:40,199
Start talking.

503
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:42,068
I like your manners.

504
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:43,802
Sit down.

505
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,244
This job we're going to pull
is in the diamond district.

506
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:55,847
This place is an
upstairs distribution.

507
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:59,051
The way it works, you
guys got to "go-between".

508
00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:01,620
He carries the diamonds
down in a little briefcase.

509
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:04,590
He doesn't take the
elevator, he uses the stairs.

510
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:06,492
It's bonafide, I
checked it out.

511
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:08,694
That's what will
make it happen.

512
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:10,262
How many stones
will he be carrying?

513
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:12,898
150k, minimum.

514
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:14,300
What's our cut?

515
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:15,934
It's a flat rate.

516
00:32:15,968 --> 00:32:18,270
Twenty-five grand each.

517
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,507
Twenty-five?

518
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,610
What are you,
crazy or something?

519
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:27,679
We split it three ways
or we ain't interested.

520
00:32:27,713 --> 00:32:30,149
Look, these
diamonds, they're rare.

521
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:32,618
No fence in New York is
gonna deal with them.

522
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:36,122
All you need to know is it's
gonna take time and money.

523
00:32:36,155 --> 00:32:39,458
And that's the rate, 25k.

524
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:44,330
Nah.

525
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:46,398
Split it three ways or nothing.

526
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:49,168
Nothing it is.

527
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:52,104
You know, I was told you
guys were professionals.

528
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:54,606
I guess I was told wrong.

529
00:32:57,576 --> 00:32:59,045
Sit.

530
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,422
Does that mean you're in?

531
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:11,990
Yeah.

532
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:13,659
[Frank] Alright, you
got any other questions?

533
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:15,694
[Ronnie] Yeah, I
got one question.

534
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:18,297
Me and my brother, we heard
a couple of things about you.

535
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,133
We need you to
clear it up for us.

536
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:22,901
You heard some
things like what?

537
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:26,238
[Vic] That whoever
works these jobs of yours,

538
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:28,707
They never get seen again.

539
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,778
Let me tell you
something, fellas.

540
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:37,216
People talk all the time, they
talk for a lot of reasons.

541
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:41,120
Envy, jealousy, greed.

542
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:42,754
All you need to
know is if you're

543
00:33:42,788 --> 00:33:46,325
Square with me, I'll
be square with you.

544
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,227
I'll be in touch.

545
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:07,213
Hi!

546
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:08,647
How you doing?

547
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,116
You're new here.

548
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:12,784
I'm Jackie.

549
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:15,387
Well, actually, we met
the other day, kind of.

550
00:34:15,421 --> 00:34:18,124
Yeah, what's yours again?

551
00:34:18,157 --> 00:34:18,990
What?

552
00:34:19,024 --> 00:34:21,227
Your name, dumb-dumb.

553
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:23,662
Oscar.

554
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:26,232
Oscar Kissell.

555
00:34:26,265 --> 00:34:27,866
[Jackie] So what
are you hoping to be?

556
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,869
A mystery writer or something?

557
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,338
I don't know.

558
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:35,707
Oh my God, is that typed?

559
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,443
Do you...

560
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:39,111
You used the typewriter.

561
00:34:39,145 --> 00:34:41,180
I didn't even know they
were around anymore.

562
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:42,548
I like typewriters.

563
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:43,315
I mean, I like things...

564
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:44,816
Hey, what's that?

565
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,318
Oh!

566
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:50,356
Gotcha.

567
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:53,925
Okay, class, everybody
take their seats.

568
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:56,027
We're gonna start.

569
00:35:00,899 --> 00:35:04,736
[Voiceover] Monday,
late afternoon.

570
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,772
Diamond district.

571
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:11,109
And Frank Stone gets ready.

572
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:20,386
A large Romanian man
comes out of an office

573
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:25,191
With a briefcase full of bling.

574
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:30,196
But, today, that large Romanian
gonna be in for a surprise.

575
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:39,671
(Speaks Romanian)

576
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,141
You two midgets
think you can rob me?

577
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:45,177
Try it.

578
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,191
[Vic] Jesus Christ,
there's a fortune in here!

579
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:00,359
[Ronnie] Nice!

580
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:02,661
Grab the bag, let's
get out of here.

581
00:36:06,532 --> 00:36:08,834
I think there's only
enough for me and my brother.

582
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:10,068
What?

583
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,270
[Vic] You heard me,
you dirty double...

584
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:16,708
[Frank] It's called
the double-cross.

585
00:36:16,742 --> 00:36:19,945
Or the dirty double-cross.

586
00:36:19,978 --> 00:36:21,380
Someone turning on
you is one of the

587
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:25,217
Unfortunate hazards
in this line of work.

588
00:36:25,251 --> 00:36:30,289
Luckily for Frank, he's
always expecting it.

589
00:36:30,322 --> 00:36:32,190
[Mr. Benson] Wow,
that's interesting.

590
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:37,529
It really is getting more
and more cohesive, Oscar.

591
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:39,197
Keep it up.

592
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:55,414
Hey, hey Oscar!

593
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,350
Hey!

594
00:37:02,254 --> 00:37:05,324
Well, I was just wondering if
you wanted to get a coffee?

595
00:37:06,592 --> 00:37:08,960
So, I just wanted to know what

596
00:37:08,994 --> 00:37:11,397
Goes on in that head of yours.

597
00:37:13,265 --> 00:37:14,700
What do you mean?

598
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:20,238
[Jackie] Well, how do you get
your stuff to sound so real?

599
00:37:20,272 --> 00:37:23,208
I don't know, I just...

600
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:28,013
I feel like I'm in the same
world as your characters.

601
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,382
It's...

602
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:31,617
I don't know.

603
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:34,152
I just write whatever
comes into my head.

604
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:41,827
Wow, I mean, Frank
Stone is so cold.

605
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:47,966
He has a lot of
demons in his past.

606
00:37:49,134 --> 00:37:51,770
They're going to stay there
until he gets rid of 'em.

607
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:56,107
He doesn't trust anyone.

608
00:37:57,309 --> 00:37:59,311
That's how he survives.

609
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:05,951
[Jackie] Have you always
had this kind of imagination?

610
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:07,018
Did you read those recommended

611
00:38:07,052 --> 00:38:09,120
Books the teacher
told us about?

612
00:38:09,154 --> 00:38:11,890
I didn't read anything.

613
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:14,125
You're so serious!

614
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:15,894
But you're modest, too.

615
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:18,830
Can you pass me the sugar?

616
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:22,534
Boo!

617
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:26,071
Oh, sorry.

618
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,742
(Horn honks)

619
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:38,249
Thanks for giving me
a ride home, Oscar.

620
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:41,953
That was nice.

621
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:44,890
Well...

622
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:51,062
When did you start dressing
like a little tugboat captain?

623
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:59,137
You know, do you
like the open sea?

624
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:03,509
Hello?

625
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:05,343
Yeah, you...

626
00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:07,245
You don't give that much.

627
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:10,081
You really don't
talk that much.

628
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,023
Oh.

629
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:21,226
Are you hungry?

630
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:22,260
Why don't you come
upstairs and let me

631
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:25,163
Make you a
fluffernutter sandwich.

632
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:27,799
Have you ever had one?

633
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:29,034
I can tell you haven't had one,

634
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:32,237
Cause your eyes didn't
light up when I said it.

635
00:39:34,072 --> 00:39:36,174
You're missing out.

636
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,112
Do you want a beer?

637
00:39:41,146 --> 00:39:42,113
No thanks.

638
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:44,282
I don't drink.

639
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,251
[Jackie] You don't drink?

640
00:39:47,853 --> 00:39:49,087
Yeesh.

641
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,156
What are you, a boy
scout or something?

642
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:52,858
How about a glass of milk?

643
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,993
[Frank] That sounds good.

644
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:03,935
[Jackie] Here you go.

645
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:06,204
(Horses whinny)

646
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:12,978
What's the matter, Oscar?

647
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:14,680
I don't know.

648
00:40:14,713 --> 00:40:17,215
Something strange
just happened.

649
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,518
[Jackie] What?

650
00:40:19,551 --> 00:40:22,220
The horse on the glass
here reminded me of

651
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:25,423
Something that happened
to me when I was a kid.

652
00:40:27,058 --> 00:40:30,896
You know I was raised
in an orphanage.

653
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:34,600
And one day, me and
all the other boys

654
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:37,703
We were all taken
on a field trip.

655
00:40:37,736 --> 00:40:41,006
But when the bus got
there, the first thing

656
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:46,978
That I saw was this
beautiful Grey horse.

657
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:49,314
So I approached the
horse really slowly

658
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:54,319
And I was talking to him
softly, the way a kid would.

659
00:40:55,487 --> 00:40:58,323
And all of a sudden,
the horse, he went nuts.

660
00:40:58,356 --> 00:41:00,425
I mean, he went
totally haywire.

661
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:05,531
Started jumping up on
his hind legs, kicking.

662
00:41:05,564 --> 00:41:06,732
He broke free from the chain

663
00:41:06,765 --> 00:41:09,835
And he started to
scare the other horses.

664
00:41:09,868 --> 00:41:14,305
Well, horses do weird
things like that sometimes.

665
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:17,909
Yeah, well the
headmaster, he got so angry

666
00:41:17,943 --> 00:41:20,912
That he grabbed me and he
started to beat me publicly,

667
00:41:20,946 --> 00:41:23,181
Right in front of
the other boys.

668
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:26,384
That headmaster
sounds like such a jerk!

669
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:30,288
And after that, all the
kids, they laughed at me.

670
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:34,392
They humiliated me, mocked me.

671
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:37,428
And I'll tell you
that headmaster...

672
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:39,731
After that, he never
missed an opportunity...

673
00:41:39,765 --> 00:41:43,134
Let's change the subject,
talk about something else.

674
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,117
Hey, Oscar?

675
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:04,255
(Laughing)

676
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:05,090
Isn't it funny?

677
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:06,524
I'm leaving.

678
00:42:06,558 --> 00:42:08,093
[Jackie] Oh, come on.

679
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:09,327
What's the matter with you?

680
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,296
Listen, you may think
everything is a joke.

681
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:14,099
But me, I take
everything seriously.

682
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:16,267
And I don't appreciate
you mocking me.

683
00:42:16,301 --> 00:42:18,469
[Jackie] I wasn't
mocking you.

684
00:42:18,503 --> 00:42:20,572
What's the matter with you?

685
00:42:20,606 --> 00:42:22,207
I...

686
00:42:22,841 --> 00:42:26,011
(Overlapping conversation)

687
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:35,654
[Vinny] Oh, look who it is!

688
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:40,391
It's Mr. Personality!

689
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:43,929
He came here to brighten up
everybody's day, now didn't ya?

690
00:42:43,962 --> 00:42:46,598
I got a question
for you, scumbag.

691
00:42:46,632 --> 00:42:51,603
How come you make everybody
sick at the very sight of you?

692
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:55,641
You got the
personality of a cobra

693
00:42:55,674 --> 00:42:57,408
And I've had it up
to here with that.

694
00:42:57,442 --> 00:42:59,911
Come on, Vinny, knock it off.

695
00:42:59,945 --> 00:43:02,013
Sit down!

696
00:43:02,047 --> 00:43:04,950
You have to excuse Vinny,
Frank.

697
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:09,087
Anyway, how are you
doing today, Frank?

698
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,488
Doing good, Tony.

699
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,157
Can I get you
anything to eat?

700
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,959
You don't have to be shy,
we have plenty of food.

701
00:43:13,992 --> 00:43:15,093
More coming out.

702
00:43:15,126 --> 00:43:17,395
No thanks, I'm not hungry.

703
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,364
No?

704
00:43:19,397 --> 00:43:22,100
Give him his freakin' money,
let him get out of here.

705
00:43:29,174 --> 00:43:30,308
[Frank] Thanks.

706
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:32,577
Oh, oh, Frankie, Frankie.

707
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,445
You know, not for nothing,

708
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:36,848
But we offer you
food all the time.

709
00:43:36,882 --> 00:43:41,419
And never once, once, do you
everysit down and eat with us.

710
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,921
What's the matter?

711
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:46,391
My gesture of friendship
doesn't agree with you?

712
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:51,830
Look at me when I'm
talking to you, Frankie.

713
00:43:53,231 --> 00:43:56,634
Now I want to know why you
think you're too good for us.

714
00:43:56,668 --> 00:43:58,036
Look, it's not that, Tony.

715
00:43:58,069 --> 00:43:59,637
It's just, you know,
I got some place

716
00:43:59,671 --> 00:44:02,007
I got to be in a hurry.

717
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,374
Hurry?

718
00:44:03,408 --> 00:44:05,877
Where you got to be, Frankie?

719
00:44:05,911 --> 00:44:07,112
Somewhere.

720
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:08,313
[Tony] Frank.

721
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:09,447
The only place
you should ever be

722
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,850
In a hurry to get to is home.

723
00:44:11,883 --> 00:44:13,584
Cause home is where
the family is.

724
00:44:13,618 --> 00:44:14,953
Here, look, let me show this.

725
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:17,522
This is my family, alright?

726
00:44:17,555 --> 00:44:19,357
This is my wife, my kids when

727
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,993
They were younger,
my grandkids.

728
00:44:22,027 --> 00:44:24,129
And this, this is the
most cherished picture

729
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:28,099
I have of my father,
God rest his soul.

730
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:33,404
You know, I loved him more than
any son ever loved a father.

731
00:44:35,473 --> 00:44:37,242
What about you, Frankie?

732
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:38,710
Do you have any
pictures of loved

733
00:44:38,744 --> 00:44:41,980
Ones you'd like to show us?

734
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:44,349
No?

735
00:44:44,382 --> 00:44:45,851
Why not?

736
00:44:45,884 --> 00:44:48,619
You're always in such a
hurry, I would think that

737
00:44:48,653 --> 00:44:52,724
You had hundreds, hundreds
of pictures to show us.

738
00:44:56,261 --> 00:44:58,663
Now the next time that
I ask you to sit down

739
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:03,001
And eat with us, make
sure you have the time.

740
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:05,904
Alright, now get the
hell out of here.

741
00:45:05,937 --> 00:45:07,072
Thanks, Tony.

742
00:45:07,105 --> 00:45:08,940
What did you say?

743
00:45:08,974 --> 00:45:11,009
What did you just mumble?

744
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,711
I said thanks, Tony.

745
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:19,117
[Tony] So, anyway,
about this weekend...

746
00:45:28,126 --> 00:45:32,497
(Piano music)

747
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:37,568
[Voiceover] There's
nothing more frustrating

748
00:45:37,602 --> 00:45:40,038
Than a man who just
can't express himself.

749
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:42,841
You know, tell you
how he feels.

750
00:45:43,942 --> 00:45:48,479
That makes him no
different than a lamp.

751
00:45:48,513 --> 00:45:51,382
Or a clay pigeon.

752
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:56,354
Yeah, clay pigeon, waiting
to get blown up into pieces.

753
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:58,957
Maybe that's why.

754
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:03,128
Maybe that's the root
behind Frank Stone's rage.

755
00:46:06,031 --> 00:46:10,101
He just lives,
second to second.

756
00:46:10,135 --> 00:46:12,037
Minute to minute.

757
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:14,005
Murder to murder.

758
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:17,408
Like an alcoholic.

759
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:20,178
Just one day at a time.

760
00:46:23,414 --> 00:46:25,216
That's my boy.

761
00:46:29,821 --> 00:46:34,792
* Bright eyes and
colors are blind again

762
00:46:36,394 --> 00:46:41,366
* Haven't seen my love
in God knows when

763
00:46:42,934 --> 00:46:47,906
* He went away, now
I'm all by myself

764
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:55,113
* All of this heart aching
is affecting my head

765
00:46:56,781 --> 00:46:58,850
* Oh no

766
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:08,193
* I've been so alone, waiting
for you to get back home

767
00:47:17,535 --> 00:47:22,507
* No more good mornings
or I love you

768
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:29,280
* Never thought my
nightmares would be so true

769
00:47:31,216 --> 00:47:36,187
* All this seems
to fight for me

770
00:47:37,755 --> 00:47:42,727
* But all I ever wanted
was for us to be alone

771
00:47:51,002 --> 00:47:56,441
* I've been so alone,
yeah, waiting for you

772
00:47:56,474 --> 00:48:01,379
* I waited for you
to come back home

773
00:48:04,282 --> 00:48:09,254
* Yeah, I'm so alone,
I waited for you

774
00:48:10,588 --> 00:48:15,560
* But now you're gone

775
00:48:26,671 --> 00:48:30,541
(Applause)

776
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:33,344
[MC] Wasn't she great?

777
00:48:33,378 --> 00:48:34,712
Chelsea, let's give
it up for Chelsea.

778
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,314
Great girl, nice act.

779
00:48:36,347 --> 00:48:40,018
And now, next, he's your
favorite ventriloquist,

780
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:41,286
Mr. John Peasy.

781
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:46,357
Hey, folks, my name is John
Peasy, this is my friend Smokey.

782
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:48,593
Holy shit, they're all white!

783
00:48:48,626 --> 00:48:50,361
Okay, we have a great
crowd of people here.

784
00:48:50,395 --> 00:48:52,197
Yeah, they look good, this
look good, I like it, like it.

785
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,131
Yeah, we got a good crowd.

786
00:48:53,164 --> 00:48:54,232
I'm the only black guy here.

787
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:56,767
Oh, it looks like my trial.

788
00:48:56,801 --> 00:48:58,636
Looking good, looking good,
looking good, looking good!

789
00:48:58,669 --> 00:48:59,870
I like this crowd, yeah, yeah.

790
00:48:59,904 --> 00:49:01,572
If you like white people, yeah.

791
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:03,274
Hate them white men shit.

792
00:49:03,308 --> 00:49:04,509
Oh yeah, now...

793
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:06,677
Hold up, where you
going, brother?

794
00:49:06,711 --> 00:49:08,679
Sit the hell down, where
the hell you going?

795
00:49:08,713 --> 00:49:09,847
I hate when a white guy gets

796
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,781
Up in the middle of
a show like that.

797
00:49:10,815 --> 00:49:13,218
Sit the hell down, cracker ass.

798
00:49:13,251 --> 00:49:14,652
Sit the hell down.

799
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:15,886
I'm in the middle of my
working here, cracker ass.

800
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:16,921
Don't sit there and
get up in the middle.

801
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,056
I'm working here.

802
00:49:18,089 --> 00:49:18,956
Alright, don't pick
on the guy, huh?

803
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:20,125
He's a mean-looking guy.

804
00:49:20,158 --> 00:49:20,925
What do you mean?

805
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,060
He looks like a killer.

806
00:49:22,093 --> 00:49:23,561
Yeah, killer, I'll
kick his ass.

807
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:25,596
Homo, sit the hell down.

808
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:27,565
Don't pick on the guy.

809
00:49:27,598 --> 00:49:28,499
I don't give a shit!

810
00:49:28,533 --> 00:49:29,567
Look at him, I see you staring.

811
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,502
Let's have a
staring contest, go.

812
00:49:31,536 --> 00:49:32,403
This is comedy, brother.

813
00:49:32,437 --> 00:49:33,571
You don't just get up and

814
00:49:33,604 --> 00:49:35,473
Walk out in the
middle of a nice show.

815
00:49:35,506 --> 00:49:36,907
Alright, that's
enough, that's enough.

816
00:49:36,941 --> 00:49:38,076
Why don't you say something to

817
00:49:38,109 --> 00:49:39,410
The guy that would
make him feel good?

818
00:49:39,444 --> 00:49:41,512
The way he looks,
attention k-mart shopper.

819
00:49:42,747 --> 00:49:46,484
He's a loser, I can't stand
his white cracker ass.

820
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:47,785
That's right, folks, you
can laugh all you want.

821
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,354
I'll kick his ass right now.

822
00:49:49,387 --> 00:49:51,922
Loser, loser, loser.

823
00:49:51,956 --> 00:49:54,225
And you're white, cracker ass.

824
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:01,299
Hey!

825
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:04,535
This was just a joke, man,
I was only kiddin' ya!

826
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:06,037
No, no!

827
00:50:14,412 --> 00:50:17,982
This week, Olivia's mailbox
wasn't empty as usual.

828
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:20,818
This week, it contained one
of those lovely pink slips

829
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,921
That indicated she had a
package at the front desk.

830
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:26,424
The clerk was so
excited for her.

831
00:50:26,457 --> 00:50:28,593
Olivia, you have mail today!

832
00:50:28,626 --> 00:50:31,096
Politely, she smiled
and took the package.

833
00:50:31,129 --> 00:50:33,564
It was a five dollar
flat rate box.

834
00:50:33,598 --> 00:50:35,500
Olivia was reminded
of how much her mother

835
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:38,236
Loved sending flat rate boxes.

836
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:40,271
Each week in college,
Olivia would receive

837
00:50:40,305 --> 00:50:43,908
One of these packages, a
veritable treasure trove

838
00:50:43,941 --> 00:50:47,812
Of candy, costume,
jewelry, school supplies,

839
00:50:47,845 --> 00:50:50,648
Anything a college
girl could desire.

840
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:52,450
The package that
she was handed today

841
00:50:52,483 --> 00:50:54,252
Was considerately different.

842
00:50:54,285 --> 00:50:55,820
On the outside, it
looked like a standard

843
00:50:55,853 --> 00:50:57,788
Five dollar flat rate box.

844
00:50:57,822 --> 00:51:00,725
But the contents had
a macabre difference.

845
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:04,095
This package contained
her mother's ashes.

846
00:51:06,297 --> 00:51:07,832
Wow.

847
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:11,736
You really have tapped into
something very personal.

848
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:15,473
Now, class, what we can
take from Mario's story

849
00:51:15,506 --> 00:51:17,808
Is don't be afraid to
be deeply personal.

850
00:51:17,842 --> 00:51:20,978
Oscar, please come on time!

851
00:51:24,449 --> 00:51:27,152
Okay, Jackie, you had
something you wanted to read?

852
00:51:27,185 --> 00:51:28,853
Uh, yeah.

853
00:51:33,258 --> 00:51:34,725
Alright.

854
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:38,363
Rosemary thought
she was different.

855
00:51:38,396 --> 00:51:40,365
She was always told that.

856
00:51:40,398 --> 00:51:45,470
By her father, by her
mother, by her classmates.

857
00:51:45,503 --> 00:51:49,174
She grew up thinking
bad about herself.

858
00:51:49,207 --> 00:51:52,610
That's why she tried to
slit her wrists many times.

859
00:51:52,643 --> 00:51:56,113
But she always managed to
find a way to get through it.

860
00:51:56,147 --> 00:51:59,750
She thought she had met someone
who could relate to her.

861
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:02,187
Another tortured soul.

862
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:05,156
But this person was more
than a tortured soul.

863
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:09,294
He also felt the need
to be hateful and cruel.

864
00:52:09,327 --> 00:52:10,595
He didn't want to
change himself

865
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:12,963
Or discover who he really was.

866
00:52:12,997 --> 00:52:15,633
He didn't want to move
on from a dark past.

867
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:18,002
He wanted to relive
it every day.

868
00:52:18,035 --> 00:52:20,271
He was pure nasty.

869
00:52:20,305 --> 00:52:23,308
I hate him, I hate him.

870
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,778
[Mr. Benson] Wow, I...

871
00:52:27,812 --> 00:52:29,113
Wow.

872
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:30,415
Jackie, I must say
you've really tapped into

873
00:52:30,448 --> 00:52:34,652
Something very personal
to get this latest work.

874
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:39,624
Anybody have any questions?

875
00:52:40,858 --> 00:52:42,660
Ackley?

876
00:52:42,693 --> 00:52:44,229
I have to say, I thought...

877
00:52:45,296 --> 00:52:47,131
[Mr. Benson] Oscar!

878
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:51,068
Oscar, please wait outside.

879
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:52,437
[Frank] Alright.

880
00:53:01,212 --> 00:53:03,080
[Mr. Benson] Okay...

881
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:07,285
Wow, that was weird.

882
00:53:09,287 --> 00:53:10,621
[Vinny] Alright, go to
Jimmy's on 10th street.

883
00:53:10,655 --> 00:53:12,290
You know the way.

884
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,363
What the hell is that banana
head doing over there?

885
00:53:18,396 --> 00:53:20,665
Pull over, pull over.

886
00:53:24,569 --> 00:53:26,003
Stop.

887
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:36,113
What the hell is Frank Stone
doing in this neighborhood?

888
00:53:47,492 --> 00:53:50,295
Wait up a second, I
want to talk to you.

889
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:55,766
Look, I'm sorry that I
spoke to you that way.

890
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,368
Alright, I made a mistake.

891
00:53:57,402 --> 00:53:58,969
I thought you were
making fun of me.

892
00:53:59,003 --> 00:54:01,406
What do you want, Oscar?

893
00:54:02,373 --> 00:54:05,209
There's something
I gotta tell you.

894
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,678
Alright, my name isn't Oscar.

895
00:54:07,712 --> 00:54:09,680
It's Frank Stone.

896
00:54:11,148 --> 00:54:13,584
Your character?

897
00:54:13,618 --> 00:54:16,220
And I work for Anthony Forte.

898
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,188
Tough Tony is real?

899
00:54:18,222 --> 00:54:19,990
It's all for real, alright?

900
00:54:20,024 --> 00:54:23,127
That's what I am, I'm a hood.

901
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,064
Why are you telling me this?

902
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,065
[Frank] I don't know.

903
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:28,999
I just feel like my
head's gonna

904
00:54:29,033 --> 00:54:31,436
Explode if I don't tell you.

905
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:43,314
Just please, just
leave me alone.

906
00:54:43,348 --> 00:54:46,551
Please, I'm sorry.

907
00:54:47,352 --> 00:54:50,220
Please just stay
away from me.

908
00:55:03,568 --> 00:55:05,903
What the hell
was that all about?

909
00:55:08,105 --> 00:55:10,975
Wait here, I want to
go see what's going on.

910
00:55:30,094 --> 00:55:32,997
Did I almost get
a smile out of you?

911
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:34,865
Almost.

912
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,971
Frank, how come
you never smile?

913
00:55:44,642 --> 00:55:46,310
[Frank] Can I
ask you something?

914
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,979
You never once told me
anything about yourself.

915
00:55:49,013 --> 00:55:50,247
Well you know
everything about me,

916
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,017
But I don't know
anything about you.

917
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:58,723
I'm just not that
open about myself.

918
00:55:58,756 --> 00:56:00,758
My private self, that is.

919
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:02,993
[Frank] Yeah?

920
00:56:03,027 --> 00:56:05,696
Is that why you
joke around so much?

921
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:08,466
To hide that private self?

922
00:56:08,499 --> 00:56:11,436
No, that's not why.

923
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:17,975
You know, if you don't want
to talk about it, it's okay.

924
00:56:21,846 --> 00:56:24,582
Well I married this really

925
00:56:24,615 --> 00:56:29,887
Rich guy that I
didn't even love.

926
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,824
But I figured I'd
have everything.

927
00:56:35,793 --> 00:56:40,765
But it wasn't really enough.

928
00:56:42,467 --> 00:56:45,636
But then we had a
beautiful daughter.

929
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:48,573
Beautiful, beautiful daughter.

930
00:56:48,606 --> 00:56:53,578
And my husband left me and...

931
00:56:58,449 --> 00:57:03,353
He got full custody of her
and I can't even visit her.

932
00:57:06,524 --> 00:57:11,462
So you see, all I want
to do is just call her.

933
00:57:11,496 --> 00:57:15,600
Tell her I'm sorry
and that I love her.

934
00:57:20,204 --> 00:57:21,772
But I can't.

935
00:57:21,806 --> 00:57:23,941
[Frank] You listen to me.

936
00:57:25,075 --> 00:57:27,678
I got to go right now.

937
00:57:27,712 --> 00:57:29,213
[Jackie] Where are you going?

938
00:57:29,246 --> 00:57:31,381
I got to go.

939
00:57:31,415 --> 00:57:35,686
But when I get back,
you and me,

940
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:39,724
I'm going to take you
to see your daughter.

941
00:57:39,757 --> 00:57:41,826
But she doesn't even know me.

942
00:57:41,859 --> 00:57:44,094
She doesn't know
me at all anymore.

943
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:45,830
[Frankie] She
knows who you are.

944
00:57:45,863 --> 00:57:46,997
And, believe me,
there's no Time

945
00:57:47,031 --> 00:57:50,467
Like the present to
get reacquainted.

946
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:53,437
Everything's going to
be all right, Jackie.

947
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,339
You'll see.

948
00:57:55,372 --> 00:57:57,942
I'll be back in a few hours.

949
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:17,294
[Tony] Hey, there he is!

950
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,696
Frankie!

951
00:58:20,064 --> 00:58:21,331
Hey, Frank, have a seat.

952
00:58:21,365 --> 00:58:22,967
How you doing, Frank?

953
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,102
How you doing, fellas?

954
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:27,805
Today is your
lucky day, Frank.

955
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:29,874
We got a call from
our boys out in Vegas

956
00:58:29,907 --> 00:58:31,508
And they need someone
from back East

957
00:58:31,542 --> 00:58:35,479
To run the security at
the casino and to oversee

958
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:38,115
All the used jewelry
business they got out there.

959
00:58:38,148 --> 00:58:41,619
And I couldn't think of
anybody but you, Frank.

960
00:58:41,652 --> 00:58:42,953
Me?

961
00:58:42,987 --> 00:58:44,254
Yeah.

962
00:58:45,322 --> 00:58:49,093
Well, for how long?

963
00:58:49,126 --> 00:58:50,227
How long?

964
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,662
For as long as it takes, Frank.

965
00:58:51,696 --> 00:58:55,666
You're going to be making
a cool 200 grand there.

966
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:57,167
200 thousand dollars?

967
00:58:57,201 --> 00:58:58,803
[Tony] Yeah.

968
00:59:01,505 --> 00:59:02,873
That's a lot of money, Tony.

969
00:59:02,907 --> 00:59:05,710
[Tony] Yeah, you go
out there, you work hard,

970
00:59:05,743 --> 00:59:08,613
You find one of those
show girls, you know...

971
00:59:08,646 --> 00:59:10,447
Settle down with
her a little bit

972
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,884
And be happy for once in your
life, you miserable bastard!

973
00:59:13,918 --> 00:59:17,622
You know, I mean 200 grand
make anybody happy, right?

974
00:59:21,525 --> 00:59:23,527
When am I supposed to leave?

975
00:59:24,494 --> 00:59:26,864
First flight tomorrow.

976
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:32,136
Hey, what's the matter?

977
00:59:32,169 --> 00:59:34,404
You seem disinterested, Frank.

978
00:59:34,438 --> 00:59:35,606
No, that's not it.

979
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,541
It's just that, you
know, I got a little

980
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,978
Something I gotta take
care of with someone.

981
00:59:41,011 --> 00:59:45,049
You know, I'll definitely
make the flight, Tony.

982
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,985
Okay.

983
00:59:48,018 --> 00:59:49,519
Is there anything else?

984
00:59:49,553 --> 00:59:52,456
Yeah, just one
more little thing.

985
00:59:52,489 --> 00:59:56,360
When you get out there, I
was just wondering if you're

986
00:59:56,393 --> 01:00:00,264
Going to write anymore stories
about me and my operation.

987
01:00:02,967 --> 01:00:05,135
Kill that rat bastard!

988
01:00:20,217 --> 01:00:21,919
No, no, no, Vinny, Vinny,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

989
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:23,888
Maybe we shouldn't do it here.

990
01:00:23,921 --> 01:00:25,355
You know what?

991
01:00:25,389 --> 01:00:28,125
Just take him down to the
warehouse and chop him up.

992
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:54,451
Come on, let's go
chop him up.

993
01:00:58,088 --> 01:00:59,523
Pop the trunk.

994
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:01,425
Who's this?

995
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:04,461
Hey, fellas.

996
01:01:05,529 --> 01:01:09,033
Can you tel me how to get
to the 59 street bridge?

997
01:01:09,066 --> 01:01:10,434
Yeah, you keep
going straight.

998
01:01:10,467 --> 01:01:12,436
If you hit the water, it
means you missed the bridge.

999
01:01:12,469 --> 01:01:14,805
Hey, man, your humor
flows like molasses.

1000
01:01:14,839 --> 01:01:17,474
And if you keep going
straight and you hit water,

1001
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:20,945
It means you missed the bridge.

1002
01:01:20,978 --> 01:01:22,679
[Police] Call for backup.

1003
01:01:24,214 --> 01:01:24,982
Tell him in Italian.

1004
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:28,886
(Speaks Italian)

1005
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:32,589
Hey, why don't
you keep smoking?

1006
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:33,991
Or burn out.

1007
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:37,161
[Police] Central B5
requesting an additional unit.

1008
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:38,528
(Gun shot)

1009
01:01:39,396 --> 01:01:42,399
(Sirens wail)

1010
01:01:44,101 --> 01:01:47,571
(Police radio)

1011
01:01:53,744 --> 01:01:55,312
(Whistles)

1012
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,381
Alright, call it in.

1013
01:01:57,414 --> 01:01:59,649
20 boy central,
requesting one addition.

1014
01:01:59,683 --> 01:02:02,019
[Radio] 5 boy 4 by on there?

1015
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:06,056
[Intercom] Paging Dr. Bender.

1016
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:09,059
Paging Dr. Bender, please.

1017
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:19,904
Dr. Bender to the
mental ward, please.

1018
01:02:35,319 --> 01:02:38,122
[Detective] How
you doing, Frank?

1019
01:02:38,155 --> 01:02:40,290
Mind if we talk to
you for a minute?

1020
01:02:48,432 --> 01:02:50,534
I don't think he heard us.

1021
01:02:50,567 --> 01:02:52,903
Hey, Frank, can you hear us?

1022
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:56,974
How you feeling, Frank?

1023
01:02:57,007 --> 01:02:59,243
Been in a coma for a few weeks.

1024
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:04,548
I'm Detective Manteiga,
this Detective Maas.

1025
01:03:04,581 --> 01:03:06,817
We're from the
Organized Crime Unit.

1026
01:03:06,851 --> 01:03:09,686
We'd like to ask you
a couple of questions.

1027
01:03:11,221 --> 01:03:12,857
Would you mind explaining
to us how you ended up

1028
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:15,659
In the trunk of
Vinny Gallino's car?

1029
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,395
[Detective Maas]
Yeah, Vinny Gallino.

1030
01:03:18,428 --> 01:03:19,864
He works for Tony Forte.

1031
01:03:19,897 --> 01:03:22,332
Did you owe him and
his boss some money?

1032
01:03:25,435 --> 01:03:28,038
Come on, you know who
we're talking about.

1033
01:03:28,072 --> 01:03:30,674
Tony Forte, aka "Tough Tony".

1034
01:03:30,707 --> 01:03:32,809
Did you owe them money?

1035
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:39,950
Come on, Frank.

1036
01:03:39,984 --> 01:03:42,319
Don't play dumb shit
with us, alright?

1037
01:03:42,352 --> 01:03:45,089
We're not rookies, we've
been around a long time.

1038
01:03:45,122 --> 01:03:50,194
You obviously must have done
something to piss them off.

1039
01:03:50,227 --> 01:03:51,561
What was it?

1040
01:03:51,595 --> 01:03:54,331
Did you get caught skimming
off the top, or what?

1041
01:04:03,373 --> 01:04:05,609
You mind telling
us what's so funny?

1042
01:04:11,715 --> 01:04:13,483
This guy's bananas.

1043
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:22,559
[Intercom] Paging Dr.
Statement, Dr. Statement please.

1044
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:24,361
So he's not crazy?

1045
01:04:24,394 --> 01:04:27,965
[Doctor] Well his head
has no structural damage.

1046
01:04:27,998 --> 01:04:29,799
But it's hard to
say at this point

1047
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:32,202
Without doing any
further tests.

1048
01:04:32,236 --> 01:04:36,140
You think maybe you're
trying to put one over on us?

1049
01:04:36,173 --> 01:04:38,943
I don't think so.

1050
01:04:38,976 --> 01:04:40,044
Unbelievable.

1051
01:04:40,077 --> 01:04:41,478
The one guy we
find and he's nuts.

1052
01:04:41,511 --> 01:04:43,280
Anything he says is not
going to hold up in court.

1053
01:04:43,313 --> 01:04:44,348
You know that?

1054
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:45,882
Yeah.

1055
01:04:45,916 --> 01:04:47,651
But I'm not buying it.

1056
01:04:47,684 --> 01:04:49,286
Thanks, Doc.

1057
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:57,494
You know, I came into this
world full of piss and vinegar.

1058
01:04:57,527 --> 01:05:00,030
You know, I started making
my bones by running numbers

1059
01:05:00,064 --> 01:05:03,400
For Hunchback Charlie
and the 9th Avenue boys?

1060
01:05:03,433 --> 01:05:06,603
And I was still in Junior
High School when I did that.

1061
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:09,839
I ran porn theater, strip
clubs, I had a stable,

1062
01:05:09,873 --> 01:05:12,909
20 girls working for me.

1063
01:05:12,943 --> 01:05:15,245
I started putting some
money out into the street,

1064
01:05:15,279 --> 01:05:18,015
Charging a vague that no
one could compete with.

1065
01:05:20,717 --> 01:05:22,586
I made a lot of money
for those fellas.

1066
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:25,322
I made some serious scratch.

1067
01:05:25,355 --> 01:05:27,091
But then...

1068
01:05:28,692 --> 01:05:33,863
The babania, shooting
up four times a day.

1069
01:05:33,897 --> 01:05:37,267
Lost everything I had.

1070
01:05:37,301 --> 01:05:41,471
Wound up doing ten years
in jail for armed robbery.

1071
01:05:41,505 --> 01:05:43,207
Ten years.

1072
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:46,276
When I got out, I was clean.

1073
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:49,046
And I wanted to get back
into the business, you know?

1074
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:54,618
So I had an uncle vouch for me.

1075
01:05:54,651 --> 01:05:57,021
And I went back into action.

1076
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:02,592
And, now, it's taken
me 30 years, 30 years

1077
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:06,663
To get my reputation
back and I'll be damned

1078
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:11,501
If I let some muck like
Frank Stone bring me down.

1079
01:06:11,535 --> 01:06:13,903
Now I want that son of
a bitch taken care of.

1080
01:06:13,937 --> 01:06:15,572
I want him put on ice.

1081
01:06:15,605 --> 01:06:18,308
And I want that done, now.

1082
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:21,911
Hate to be the
one who told you so,

1083
01:06:21,945 --> 01:06:24,148
Tony, but I told you so.

1084
01:06:25,115 --> 01:06:27,417
(Laughing)

1085
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:45,269
[Intercom] Dr. Forest,
dial 118, please.

1086
01:06:45,302 --> 01:06:49,106
Dr. Forest, please dial 1-1-8.

1087
01:06:53,577 --> 01:06:56,280
(Machine beeping)

1088
01:07:14,931 --> 01:07:18,168
[Frank] No matter
where you roam.

1089
01:07:18,202 --> 01:07:21,405
(Laughs)

1090
01:07:28,011 --> 01:07:31,081
* They call it the blues

1091
01:07:31,115 --> 01:07:34,551
(Laughing)

1092
01:07:40,124 --> 01:07:42,859
I have to sit next
to you now.

1093
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:45,562
I gotta sit next to you!

1094
01:07:45,595 --> 01:07:47,197
What's so funny, man?

1095
01:07:47,231 --> 01:07:49,533
What's so goddamn funny?

1096
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:53,170
Come on, white boy,
share with me the joke.

1097
01:07:54,571 --> 01:08:00,577
See, last week this time,
I had a job, I had a car.

1098
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:02,712
I had a woman.

1099
01:08:02,746 --> 01:08:04,514
A woman!

1100
01:08:04,548 --> 01:08:08,418
I had a woman, white boy.

1101
01:08:08,452 --> 01:08:11,755
I was making good
money, Arizona.

1102
01:08:11,788 --> 01:08:16,960
The place to be to work for
the right to make a living.

1103
01:08:16,993 --> 01:08:20,230
I used to play in the band,
a band like rock 'n' roll.

1104
01:08:20,264 --> 01:08:25,869
Stupid camisoles in the 80's,
that's where I met my girl.

1105
01:08:25,902 --> 01:08:28,138
Well, my ex girl.

1106
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:31,074
She left me, white boy.

1107
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,977
She left me for...

1108
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:36,112
You're laughing!

1109
01:08:36,146 --> 01:08:41,117
She left me for a short order
cook and goddamn Mexican!

1110
01:08:46,223 --> 01:08:49,226
A goddamn Mexican!

1111
01:08:51,195 --> 01:08:54,864
[Frank] Dude, that's
just wrong, man.

1112
01:08:54,898 --> 01:08:56,766
My life sucks, white boy.

1113
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:00,504
[Frank] What's
your name, brother?

1114
01:09:00,537 --> 01:09:02,539
John.

1115
01:09:05,074 --> 01:09:06,576
But you can call me Cricket.

1116
01:09:06,610 --> 01:09:08,978
Everybody calls me Cricket.

1117
01:09:09,012 --> 01:09:11,315
Cricket, cricket,
like a cricket.

1118
01:09:11,348 --> 01:09:13,217
That jumps around.

1119
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:15,118
I jump around like a cricket.

1120
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:16,720
[Frank] Oh, Cricket, baby.

1121
01:09:16,753 --> 01:09:21,258
[Cricket] I love you, white
boy, you're the best, man.

1122
01:09:21,291 --> 01:09:22,692
I have a tattoo.

1123
01:09:22,726 --> 01:09:23,527
[Frank] Yeah?

1124
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:24,528
Tattoo of a cricket.

1125
01:09:24,561 --> 01:09:26,062
Look, look, look.

1126
01:09:26,095 --> 01:09:27,631
[Frank] Ah, look at that!

1127
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:29,165
It's a cricket.

1128
01:09:30,066 --> 01:09:32,135
[Frank] Listen,
you know, brother?

1129
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:35,505
I really appreciate you opening
up to me like this, brother.

1130
01:09:35,539 --> 01:09:37,841
I mean, really I do, you know?

1131
01:09:37,874 --> 01:09:38,942
I mean, from the heart.

1132
01:09:38,975 --> 01:09:40,143
The heart?

1133
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:41,345
[Frank] You know
what I'm saying?

1134
01:09:41,378 --> 01:09:43,747
From the heart, brother.

1135
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:44,648
(Hand buzzes)

1136
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:46,383
[Cricket] Holy shit, man!

1137
01:09:47,451 --> 01:09:48,918
Oh, man!

1138
01:09:48,952 --> 01:09:49,886
Dammit!

1139
01:09:49,919 --> 01:09:51,455
Dadgummit!

1140
01:09:51,488 --> 01:09:53,790
(Continues yelling)

1141
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:59,095
Alright, guys, finish
your drink and get out.

1142
01:09:59,128 --> 01:10:00,964
Wait a minute!

1143
01:10:00,997 --> 01:10:02,932
Wait, you throwing me
out of here for laughing?

1144
01:10:02,966 --> 01:10:04,133
Is that...

1145
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:06,603
I mean, what is wrong
with this place?

1146
01:10:06,636 --> 01:10:07,371
Hey!

1147
01:10:07,404 --> 01:10:09,373
This place sucks!

1148
01:10:09,406 --> 01:10:11,007
Hit the door, pal.

1149
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,610
I want you out of here, now.

1150
01:10:13,643 --> 01:10:15,545
[Frank] Alright,
alright, alright.

1151
01:10:15,579 --> 01:10:17,847
[Frank] No hard feelings.

1152
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:22,319
Alright, I'm going, okay?

1153
01:10:22,352 --> 01:10:23,620
I'm going.

1154
01:10:23,653 --> 01:10:25,622
Hey, what's that on your nose?

1155
01:10:25,655 --> 01:10:27,424
(Yelling)

1156
01:10:29,393 --> 01:10:30,994
Crazy, man!

1157
01:10:31,995 --> 01:10:32,762
Goddammit!

1158
01:10:32,796 --> 01:10:34,498
[Frank] Hey, Cricket.

1159
01:10:34,531 --> 01:10:36,433
[Cricket] Goddamit!

1160
01:10:39,636 --> 01:10:41,305
Hi.

1161
01:10:41,338 --> 01:10:42,539
(Laughing)

1162
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:44,140
Hello?

1163
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:45,375
Hey, listen, I've
had a hell of a day.

1164
01:10:45,409 --> 01:10:47,811
I just broke out of a hospital.

1165
01:10:49,045 --> 01:10:52,316
What the hell you
laughing at, it's true!

1166
01:10:52,349 --> 01:10:56,152
These fuckin' guys
tried to kill me.

1167
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:57,387
They did!

1168
01:10:57,421 --> 01:10:58,688
They took guns, they
were shooting at me,

1169
01:10:58,722 --> 01:11:01,325
They shot up the place,
they shot up my pillow.

1170
01:11:03,427 --> 01:11:07,297
Well, I needed something to
wear, so I borrowed these.

1171
01:11:08,632 --> 01:11:10,266
The guy next to me
was dying of TB,

1172
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:12,469
I figured he didn't need 'em.

1173
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:16,239
You're kind of a fun audience.

1174
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:18,575
You, you, I love you.

1175
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:20,477
Oh my God, you!

1176
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:23,680
(Laughs)

1177
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:30,019
I had eight dollars
stashed in my socks.

1178
01:11:30,053 --> 01:11:32,856
And I dug it out and
stuck it in my pocket

1179
01:11:32,889 --> 01:11:36,760
As I walked up Broadway
towards 137 street.

1180
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:40,229
I saw Flockle standing in
front of the subway entrance.

1181
01:11:40,263 --> 01:11:41,831
"What's happening", I said.

1182
01:11:41,865 --> 01:11:43,900
Not much.

1183
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:03,353
[Bystander] Yo,
what are you doing?

1184
01:12:05,455 --> 01:12:07,023
No!

1185
01:12:07,724 --> 01:12:08,625
No!

1186
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:10,226
Oh!

1187
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:12,128
Keep throwing!

1188
01:12:33,216 --> 01:12:35,919
[Voiceover] Dear Jackie,
it's your friend, Frank.

1189
01:12:35,952 --> 01:12:38,254
I've been meaning to call
you for some time now,

1190
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:40,590
But thought this note would do.

1191
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:46,796
Something happened
that changed my life.

1192
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:48,565
I'm still not sure
what exactly,

1193
01:12:48,598 --> 01:12:51,535
But all I know is
that I'm happy.

1194
01:12:51,568 --> 01:12:54,538
Truly happy for the first time.

1195
01:12:54,571 --> 01:12:57,073
And I want you to be happy.

1196
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:59,208
So I suggest we see
your daughter together

1197
01:12:59,242 --> 01:13:03,913
As originally planned so you
can tell her that you love her.

1198
01:13:03,947 --> 01:13:06,816
Meet me at the coffee shop
tomorrow at three o'clock.

1199
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:08,952
And we'll leave together.

1200
01:13:08,985 --> 01:13:11,621
I can't wait to look at
your inspiring presence

1201
01:13:11,655 --> 01:13:14,691
And your beautiful
face once again.

1202
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:16,192
Thank you very, very much for

1203
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:19,796
Taking the time
to understand me.

1204
01:13:19,829 --> 01:13:23,299
Your friend, always, Frank.

1205
01:13:30,206 --> 01:13:31,775
[Jackie] Frank?

1206
01:13:31,808 --> 01:13:34,177
How the hell did
you get in here?

1207
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:36,312
That letter you wrote
me was so beautiful,

1208
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:38,582
I cried like a baby.

1209
01:13:39,449 --> 01:13:41,551
[Vinny] Like a baby, huh?

1210
01:13:43,152 --> 01:13:44,454
Look at me.

1211
01:13:49,325 --> 01:13:50,894
I want to ask you one question.

1212
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:52,395
One question.

1213
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:55,565
If I don't like the answer,
we're gonna bash your face in.

1214
01:13:58,735 --> 01:14:02,171
Frank take you to
Coney Island, huh?

1215
01:14:03,172 --> 01:14:06,009
Did he do this to you, huh?

1216
01:14:06,042 --> 01:14:08,311
Did he do this to you?

1217
01:14:09,178 --> 01:14:12,181
I'm gonna ask you one question.

1218
01:14:12,215 --> 01:14:14,450
Where is Frank Stone?

1219
01:14:17,587 --> 01:14:18,722
I swear I don't know.

1220
01:14:18,755 --> 01:14:21,024
Answer him.

1221
01:14:21,057 --> 01:14:25,895
One more time,
where is Frank Stone?

1222
01:14:27,163 --> 01:14:29,899
[Jackie] I swear I
don't know!

1223
01:14:34,003 --> 01:14:36,540
[Vinny] Where is Frank Stone?

1224
01:14:36,573 --> 01:14:38,975
I swear I don't know.

1225
01:14:39,008 --> 01:14:42,211
I'd tell you if I did, I
swear, but I don't know.

1226
01:14:46,616 --> 01:14:48,417
Finish her off.

1227
01:14:54,758 --> 01:14:58,061
(Laughing)

1228
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:19,683
Oh, if it isn't
Cocky and Snowwinkle?

1229
01:15:19,716 --> 01:15:21,084
What's up, Frank?

1230
01:15:21,117 --> 01:15:22,418
Paper time's over,
pajama boy.

1231
01:15:22,451 --> 01:15:25,221
Enough of the clown routine.

1232
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:27,824
Catch any bad guys
lately, coppers?

1233
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:29,492
Cut the bullshit,
Frank, alright?

1234
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:32,596
We want you to testify
against Tough Tony.

1235
01:15:32,629 --> 01:15:34,163
I don't wanna, you know?

1236
01:15:34,197 --> 01:15:39,302
I'm having so much fun just
hanging out and being happy.

1237
01:15:39,335 --> 01:15:40,670
Why are you protecting
this piece of garbage?

1238
01:15:40,704 --> 01:15:42,138
He tried to have you killed.

1239
01:15:42,171 --> 01:15:46,342
So did my mother, but I don't
hold that against her, huh?

1240
01:15:47,711 --> 01:15:50,213
Yeah, well I can understand
why your mother hated you.

1241
01:15:50,246 --> 01:15:53,049
I know you five seconds
and I can't stand you.

1242
01:15:53,082 --> 01:15:54,283
Detective, you should really

1243
01:15:54,317 --> 01:15:58,154
Try a more refreshing
breath mint.

1244
01:15:58,187 --> 01:16:00,957
You think you're
crazy, huh, Frank?

1245
01:16:00,990 --> 01:16:02,759
Look at that.

1246
01:16:02,792 --> 01:16:05,228
But I'm the one who's
crazy around here.

1247
01:16:05,261 --> 01:16:06,129
I'm from east New York.

1248
01:16:06,162 --> 01:16:07,597
Brooklyn, kid.

1249
01:16:07,631 --> 01:16:09,432
We used to throw
people off rooftops.

1250
01:16:09,465 --> 01:16:10,967
Stick up gangsters.

1251
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,370
Rob drug dealers, then
we'd sell it back to them.

1252
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:15,605
So don't sit here and think

1253
01:16:15,639 --> 01:16:18,341
You're the only
one that's crazy.

1254
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:21,645
Let me tell you something.

1255
01:16:21,678 --> 01:16:25,448
If I didn't have this badge,
I'd forget that I'm a cop.

1256
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:30,553
[Detective Maas] I'd
really listen to that, Frank.

1257
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:31,755
What are you gonna do?

1258
01:16:31,788 --> 01:16:33,823
You going to throw
me off a rooftop?

1259
01:16:42,699 --> 01:16:44,533
Then keep laughing.

1260
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:49,205
Aren't you supposed to meet
that girl that you like?

1261
01:16:50,707 --> 01:16:52,375
Jackie, right?

1262
01:16:54,878 --> 01:16:56,345
[Detective Maas] I
got something for you.

1263
01:16:56,379 --> 01:16:58,314
You're gonna like this.

1264
01:17:03,386 --> 01:17:05,655
She's waiting for
you at this address.

1265
01:17:05,689 --> 01:17:07,824
Now that's funny.

1266
01:17:14,764 --> 01:17:17,066
[Frank] Is Jackie Mott here?

1267
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:24,373
Oh no.

1268
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:03,412
(Horse whinnies)

1269
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:17,160
Where'd you take us?

1270
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:18,361
I told you, this is the best

1271
01:18:18,394 --> 01:18:20,263
Rub and tub joint in
the city, bar none.

1272
01:18:20,296 --> 01:18:21,364
See, this is what
I'm talking about!

1273
01:18:21,397 --> 01:18:23,332
[Woman] Hello.

1274
01:18:23,366 --> 01:18:24,267
Follow me, please.

1275
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:26,602
[Vinny] Sure, anywhere.

1276
01:18:26,635 --> 01:18:29,705
(Intense music)

1277
01:19:15,218 --> 01:19:16,452
(Tires screech)

1278
01:19:21,357 --> 01:19:22,926
(Horse whinnies)

1279
01:19:42,511 --> 01:19:44,981
Come on, I want
to win tonight.

1280
01:20:10,673 --> 01:20:11,740
(Gun shot)

1281
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:39,402
(Tires screech)

1282
01:20:42,371 --> 01:20:46,109
(Horse whinnies)

1283
01:21:04,593 --> 01:21:09,365
(Urinating)

1284
01:21:53,476 --> 01:21:55,044
(Phone rings)

1285
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:58,181
(Phone rings)

1286
01:22:00,149 --> 01:22:01,517
(Phone rings)

1287
01:22:03,019 --> 01:22:03,987
[Man on phone]
(Speaks Italian)

1288
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:05,388
[Tony] Yes, it's me.

1289
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:06,956
[Man on phone]
(Speaks Italian)

1290
01:22:06,990 --> 01:22:09,058
[Tony] I have a problem
that needs fixing.

1291
01:22:09,092 --> 01:22:11,160
[Man on phone]
(Speaks Italian)

1292
01:22:11,194 --> 01:22:14,964
[Tony] I found this
rat in my kitchen

1293
01:22:14,998 --> 01:22:18,167
And it needs to be
exterminated right away.

1294
01:22:18,201 --> 01:22:20,936
[Man on phone]
(Speaks Italian)

1295
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:22,438
[Tony] I want you to
get the best exterminator

1296
01:22:22,471 --> 01:22:25,608
Money can buy,
that's what I want.

1297
01:22:25,641 --> 01:22:29,645
[Man on phone]
(Speaks Italian)

1298
01:22:29,678 --> 01:22:30,713
[Tony] He's the best?

1299
01:22:30,746 --> 01:22:33,482
[Man on phone]
(Speaks Italian)

1300
01:22:33,516 --> 01:22:34,850
[Tony] Alright,
set up a meeting.

1301
01:22:34,883 --> 01:22:38,387
[Man on phone]
(Speaks Italian)

1302
01:22:57,173 --> 01:22:59,875
Now I want to hire you cause

1303
01:22:59,908 --> 01:23:03,512
Word got around to me
that you're the best.

1304
01:23:03,546 --> 01:23:05,614
I know what people
call you by reputation.

1305
01:23:05,648 --> 01:23:07,216
What should I call you?

1306
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:09,418
What do you call yourself?

1307
01:23:20,396 --> 01:23:22,365
Lucifer.

1308
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:24,933
Lucifer.

1309
01:23:26,035 --> 01:23:29,605
I'm gonna give you a chance
to live up to that name.

1310
01:23:29,638 --> 01:23:34,610
Because this isn't
business, this is personal.

1311
01:23:36,379 --> 01:23:41,350
I want you to cause
Frank Stone more pain

1312
01:23:42,551 --> 01:23:46,589
And suffering than
humanly possible.

1313
01:23:46,622 --> 01:23:48,724
I want you to cause him
more pain and suffering

1314
01:23:48,757 --> 01:23:52,328
Than you ever caused
anybody, ever.

1315
01:23:55,198 --> 01:23:58,267
Do we understand each other?

1316
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:20,189
(Knock on door)

1317
01:24:20,223 --> 01:24:22,425
[Detective Maas]
Frank, open up.

1318
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,329
We have a search warrant.

1319
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,400
Frank, open up.

1320
01:24:31,434 --> 01:24:33,236
You think he's in there?

1321
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:38,374
[Detective Maas]
Come on, Frank,

1322
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:40,276
Or we're going to
bust down the door.

1323
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:42,778
(Knocks on door)

1324
01:24:42,811 --> 01:24:44,380
Frank, open up.

1325
01:24:44,947 --> 01:24:46,515
(Knocks on door)

1326
01:24:48,851 --> 01:24:52,421
(Radio static)

1327
01:25:03,732 --> 01:25:07,603
(Radio static)

1328
01:26:47,102 --> 01:26:47,970
(Gun clicks)

1329
01:26:48,003 --> 01:26:49,638
(Grunts)

1330
01:27:12,461 --> 01:27:14,196
Well?

1331
01:27:16,499 --> 01:27:18,467
Did you get him?

1332
01:27:20,469 --> 01:27:23,071
I asked you a question.

1333
01:27:29,111 --> 01:27:30,413
Did you kill him?

1334
01:27:30,446 --> 01:27:33,048
Did you kill Frank Stone?

1335
01:27:36,352 --> 01:27:38,954
What's the matter with you?

1336
01:27:53,569 --> 01:27:55,404
[Girl] Bye, dad.

1337
01:27:58,741 --> 01:28:00,676
[Frank] You're Sarah, right?

1338
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:04,146
My name is Frank.

1339
01:28:04,179 --> 01:28:06,449
I was a friend of your mom's.

1340
01:28:07,416 --> 01:28:10,152
She wanted me to
tell you something.

1341
01:28:12,054 --> 01:28:15,424
She wanted me to tell
you that she loved ya.

1342
01:28:15,458 --> 01:28:18,394
That she always loved you.

1343
01:28:31,006 --> 01:28:35,978
(Church bell dings)

1344
01:28:58,133 --> 01:29:00,002
How you doin', Tony?

1345
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:03,739
Alright.

1346
01:29:04,573 --> 01:29:06,308
Alright, Frank.

1347
01:29:06,942 --> 01:29:08,411
You got me.

1348
01:29:08,444 --> 01:29:10,746
So just do what you got to do.

1349
01:29:10,779 --> 01:29:12,214
Alright, I just made
peace with my maker.

1350
01:29:12,247 --> 01:29:13,281
I don't care about dying.

1351
01:29:13,315 --> 01:29:15,150
Go ahead, do what
you got to do.

1352
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:18,120
Do you really think a
one minute prayer is going

1353
01:29:18,153 --> 01:29:20,989
To straighten things out with
the big guy upstairs, Tony?

1354
01:29:21,023 --> 01:29:22,758
Yeah, I do.

1355
01:29:22,791 --> 01:29:25,661
He knows what I did
was out of necessity.

1356
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:27,329
Necessity?

1357
01:29:28,531 --> 01:29:30,065
(Gun shot)

1358
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:33,368
Frank!

1359
01:29:36,739 --> 01:29:39,107
[Frank] You feel it, Tony?

1360
01:29:39,141 --> 01:29:40,909
That's the feeling
of pain and agony

1361
01:29:40,943 --> 01:29:43,579
That you cause people
out of necessity.

1362
01:29:43,612 --> 01:29:46,281
I'm an avenging angel, Tony.

1363
01:29:46,314 --> 01:29:49,117
This time you hurt
the wrong person.

1364
01:30:03,331 --> 01:30:06,268
[Comedian] (Laughs)
Yeah, I feel better.

1365
01:30:06,301 --> 01:30:08,771
I used to be a bit
of a partier.

1366
01:30:08,804 --> 01:30:10,072
I used to drink too much.

1367
01:30:10,105 --> 01:30:11,440
A lot of people say to me

1368
01:30:11,474 --> 01:30:12,775
"Art, what's a wild
night of drinking to you?"

1369
01:30:12,808 --> 01:30:13,876
"You look like
you've had a few."

1370
01:30:13,909 --> 01:30:15,043
And I have.

1371
01:30:15,077 --> 01:30:16,211
A wild night of drinking
to me is when you

1372
01:30:16,244 --> 01:30:18,413
Drink too much and
eventually you pass out.

1373
01:30:18,447 --> 01:30:19,448
And when you wake
up, you're naked

1374
01:30:19,482 --> 01:30:21,784
In a police car with two cops.

1375
01:30:21,817 --> 01:30:24,987
But the weird part
is, you're driving.

1376
01:30:26,154 --> 01:30:28,090
That'll be a wild
night of drinking!

1377
01:30:28,123 --> 01:30:29,224
Not for you, man.

1378
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:30,058
That's like a Tuesday
night for you.

1379
01:30:30,092 --> 01:30:31,994
(Laughing)

1380
01:30:32,027 --> 01:30:34,763
I did a lot of drugs, as well.

1381
01:30:34,797 --> 01:30:36,198
The reason I did
drugs was, I think,

1382
01:30:36,231 --> 01:30:38,366
The anti-drug slogans
when I was a kid were bad.

1383
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,703
Like, remember "hugs
are better than drugs".

1384
01:30:40,736 --> 01:30:42,204
That didn't work for me.

1385
01:30:42,237 --> 01:30:44,339
My mother used to scream that
at me as I left the house.

1386
01:30:44,372 --> 01:30:46,174
"Remember, hugs are
better than drugs."

1387
01:30:46,208 --> 01:30:47,342
And I believed her.

1388
01:30:47,375 --> 01:30:48,611
I believed everything
my mother said

1389
01:30:48,644 --> 01:30:51,046
Until the first time
I got high at a party.

1390
01:30:51,079 --> 01:30:53,248
I leaned back and
I was like "Wow."

1391
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:56,485
"This is way better than
when my mother hugs me."

1392
01:30:56,519 --> 01:30:58,320
"What else has she been
lying to me about?"

1393
01:30:58,353 --> 01:30:59,522
[Audience member] Oh my God!

1394
01:30:59,555 --> 01:31:02,758
Do I not have
great bone structure?

1395
01:31:02,791 --> 01:31:06,562
Am I not the best looking
boy in New Jersey?

1396
01:31:06,595 --> 01:31:08,296
Hugs are great, but
better than drugs?

1397
01:31:08,330 --> 01:31:10,966
Come on, let's not
lie to the kids.

1398
01:31:10,999 --> 01:31:12,434
Let me put it to you this way.

1399
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:16,972
I never drove to Harlem at
4am to get somebody to hug me.

1400
01:31:17,005 --> 01:31:20,843
Hey, Carlos, here's 20 bucks,
just put your arms around me.

1401
01:31:22,545 --> 01:31:24,312
I grew up with a
domineering mother.

1402
01:31:24,346 --> 01:31:25,480
She would say stuff at the

1403
01:31:25,514 --> 01:31:26,949
Top of her lungs,
screaming at me.

1404
01:31:26,982 --> 01:31:28,784
Some bad, some good,
it was confusing.

1405
01:31:28,817 --> 01:31:30,018
I didn't know what to do.

1406
01:31:30,052 --> 01:31:31,419
She would say stuff
like "I hate you!"

1407
01:31:31,453 --> 01:31:33,121
"I never want to see you again."

1408
01:31:33,155 --> 01:31:35,624
"Are you hungry?"

1409
01:31:35,658 --> 01:31:37,593
"Get out of this house
and never come back."

1410
01:31:37,626 --> 01:31:41,029
"There are chicken goblets
in the refrigerator."

1411
01:31:41,063 --> 01:31:42,497
And since then, I
gained some weight.

1412
01:31:42,531 --> 01:31:44,266
I'm not gonna lie to you,
I've had some weight issues.

1413
01:31:44,299 --> 01:31:45,534
I try to lose weight.

1414
01:31:45,568 --> 01:31:46,468
Someone said "Oh, you
want to lose weight?"

1415
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:47,670
"You should go swimming."

1416
01:31:47,703 --> 01:31:49,638
I've never been swimming
before in my life.

1417
01:31:49,672 --> 01:31:50,906
And that's because
it has never been

1418
01:31:50,939 --> 01:31:54,076
More than a half an
hour since I last ate.

1419
01:31:54,109 --> 01:31:55,410
You know what I'm
talking about?

1420
01:31:55,443 --> 01:31:58,280
(Clapping)

1421
01:31:59,081 --> 01:32:03,418
(Slow music)

1422
01:32:16,098 --> 01:32:18,033
[Mr. Benson] Any questions?

1423
01:32:18,066 --> 01:32:19,234
No?

1424
01:32:20,068 --> 01:32:22,738
Alright then, well
let's move on.

1425
01:32:24,607 --> 01:32:28,811
From nothingness came I,
and it is where I shall go.

1426
01:32:28,844 --> 01:32:32,114
Well, at least that is
what I used to think.

1427
01:32:32,147 --> 01:32:34,917
During those lonely days
and sleepless nights,

1428
01:32:34,950 --> 01:32:38,286
To pacify my soul, I
would say these words.

1429
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:41,223
They made me, somehow,
understand my existence

1430
01:32:41,256 --> 01:32:45,060
Until I had to live
another day of coldness.

1431
01:32:45,093 --> 01:32:47,996
And I lived those
days and wept.

1432
01:32:48,030 --> 01:32:51,366
Like all men who
contemplate their agony.

1433
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:54,536
Then, like a ray of sun
peaking through the clouds,

1434
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:57,239
You came shining on to me.

1435
01:32:57,272 --> 01:33:00,709
With a radiance only the birds
of paradise could understand.

1436
01:33:00,743 --> 01:33:03,445
Bringing forth
wisdom and beauty,

1437
01:33:03,478 --> 01:33:05,914
Compassion and understanding.

1438
01:33:05,948 --> 01:33:07,850
Mercy.

1439
01:33:09,852 --> 01:33:12,487
Then, without warning,
you left this world.

1440
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:16,591
But not without teaching me
who I am and what I should be.

1441
01:33:16,625 --> 01:33:18,661
And where I should go.

1442
01:33:18,694 --> 01:33:21,964
And it is that which I
am most grateful for.

1443
01:33:21,997 --> 01:33:24,132
That you taught me
to see the light.

1444
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:34,609
Have a good night,
Tony, see you tomorrow.

1445
01:34:00,736 --> 01:34:02,537
Hey Tony?

1446
01:34:02,570 --> 01:34:04,907
I changed my mind.

1447
01:34:25,994 --> 01:34:29,031
I'm a person who
knew Frank Stone, okay?

1448
01:34:29,064 --> 01:34:31,934
When he was a
little, little boy.

1449
01:34:31,967 --> 01:34:36,271
Before he had a chance to
turn his rage on the world.

1450
01:34:36,304 --> 01:34:37,439
Okay?

1451
01:34:40,976 --> 01:34:42,477
Who are you?

1452
01:34:43,245 --> 01:34:44,346
And if you know, you'd be the

1453
01:34:44,379 --> 01:34:46,414
First person I
ever met that did.

1454
01:34:49,584 --> 01:34:51,319
Okay?

1455
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,790
I got nothing else
to say to you.

1456
01:34:56,658 --> 01:35:00,729
Now many men don't mean this
when they say it, but I do.

1457
01:35:00,763 --> 01:35:04,199
If you don't leave here right
now, I'm going to kill you.

1458
01:35:04,232 --> 01:35:05,533
Okay?
