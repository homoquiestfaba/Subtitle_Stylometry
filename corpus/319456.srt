1
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,811
Great day to watch a game.

2
00:02:23,921 --> 00:02:27,175
But first things first.
More important things to do.

3
00:02:31,983 --> 00:02:33,161
Thomas to Stevens.

4
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:38,562
ETA 1700.

5
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:40,399
Thank you.

6
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:50,408
The Cherokees and the Mammoths
with the right to go on to the playoffs.

7
00:02:50,513 --> 00:02:53,834
And their biggest fan, President Harmon,
who hasn't missed a game all season...

8
00:02:53,935 --> 00:02:55,708
is not here today. Can you believe it?

9
00:02:55,812 --> 00:02:57,550
It's true, Dave. But for a good reason.

10
00:02:57,654 --> 00:02:59,595
Instead he's attending
the National Merit Awards...

11
00:02:59,695 --> 00:03:01,142
at Arlington University.

12
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:04,562
And I got a feeling that somehow
he's gonna get to a radio or television.

13
00:03:04,665 --> 00:03:07,750
- There's no way he's gonna miss this one.
- You're absolutely right, Ernie.

14
00:03:07,857 --> 00:03:10,347
And I believe that we are set now
for the kickoff...

15
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:12,824
and you are about to see it live.

16
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,436
So, Alex...

17
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:33,263
- who won the last game?
- I did, Mr. President.

18
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:36,554
That makes three in a row?

19
00:03:38,267 --> 00:03:41,588
- Yeah. Honey?
- Oh, yes.

20
00:03:43,928 --> 00:03:46,688
It's too bad
that this speech had to be today...

21
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:50,180
since it's the last home game
you could officially see as President.

22
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,086
But they're gonna be
a lot more fun to watch...

23
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:54,623
when I don't have to run a country
at the same time.

24
00:03:54,723 --> 00:03:58,605
Oh, boy, state dinners every night
do get a bit old.

25
00:03:59,034 --> 00:04:03,208
I can hardly wait to curl up on the couch
with a box of Krispy Kremes.

26
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,991
Alex.

27
00:04:09,138 --> 00:04:11,933
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- You're welcome.

28
00:04:37,936 --> 00:04:40,034
Okay. The other side, ma'am.

29
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:44,215
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

30
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:56,659
And here's Mr. Stevens.

31
00:04:57,584 --> 00:05:00,344
Stevens! Mr. Stevens!

32
00:05:01,204 --> 00:05:02,617
Okay, thanks.

33
00:05:02,718 --> 00:05:04,031
Excuse me.

34
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:11,100
The President has decided to spend
a few minutes with you upon his arrival.

35
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:13,640
And he should be here shortly.

36
00:05:13,743 --> 00:05:17,098
Mr. Stevens, is the President
backing the Vice President?

37
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,060
Mr. Stevens, can you tell us about security?

38
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:24,728
We're on approach.

39
00:05:28,652 --> 00:05:29,932
Excuse me.

40
00:06:48,297 --> 00:06:50,362
Gun!

41
00:07:07,123 --> 00:07:08,929
Get Air Med over here!

42
00:07:26,178 --> 00:07:28,838
Get Air Med over here, now!

43
00:07:46,814 --> 00:07:50,629
We're en route to your location
with the President of the United States.

44
00:07:51,323 --> 00:07:54,184
He has a gunshot wound to the head,
one entry wound.

45
00:07:54,285 --> 00:07:55,923
Patient is trauma-coded.

46
00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:58,857
We have a large-bore lV running wide open.

47
00:07:59,156 --> 00:08:00,761
ETA is in five minutes.

48
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:14,979
I'm just gonna go to the closest hospital.
I guess that's where they're gonna take him.

49
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,529
All right.

50
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:19,198
And let me know if you need anything.

51
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:22,159
Okay, thanks.
I'll call you as soon as I have something.

52
00:08:29,006 --> 00:08:30,779
There they are. Let's go.

53
00:08:35,852 --> 00:08:37,557
Hurry up. This way.

54
00:08:38,814 --> 00:08:40,519
- Secured.
- Locking.

55
00:08:51,353 --> 00:08:53,586
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You have an open wound. You're not sterile.

56
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,564
I can't leave his side. He's my responsibility.

57
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:57,303
In here, he's my responsibility.

58
00:08:57,409 --> 00:08:59,115
Nurse, take him to the ER.

59
00:08:59,219 --> 00:09:01,744
I'll be with him all the way through.

60
00:09:47,895 --> 00:09:51,441
You're a lucky man. X-ray looks good.
No broken bones.

61
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:55,164
Take it easy on the hand for a few weeks.
You'll be fine.

62
00:10:22,683 --> 00:10:24,355
Feels like forever.

63
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:30,609
- How's the hand?
- Fine, thank you, ma'am.

64
00:10:34,695 --> 00:10:35,772
Alex.

65
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:41,036
You were there.

66
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:50,062
How was he?

67
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,823
Alex, please talk to me.

68
00:10:59,675 --> 00:11:01,414
It didn't look good.

69
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,065
I need a minute to myself.

70
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:22,245
Doctor...

71
00:11:23,635 --> 00:11:26,922
- would you please inform the press?
- Of course.

72
00:11:27,024 --> 00:11:28,303
Thank you.

73
00:11:31,763 --> 00:11:33,996
Ma'am, I'm sorry for your loss.

74
00:11:35,318 --> 00:11:38,269
If you need a few private moments
with him...

75
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,437
I don't want to see him like that.

76
00:11:56,678 --> 00:11:58,416
Special Agent Thomas?

77
00:11:59,968 --> 00:12:02,863
Hi, I'm Kate Crawford
from the Washington Inlander.

78
00:12:02,964 --> 00:12:04,635
I know who you are.

79
00:12:05,069 --> 00:12:07,829
Then talk to me. You might need a friend.

80
00:12:08,492 --> 00:12:09,703
Let's go.

81
00:12:38,474 --> 00:12:40,011
- Hey.
- Hi.

82
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,530
How did you get into his army records?

83
00:12:48,315 --> 00:12:50,548
Never mind. I don't want to know.

84
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,630
Your sources,
have they given you anything?

85
00:12:54,996 --> 00:12:58,642
Well, the Secret Service had him on file
as a Class Three threat case.

86
00:12:58,748 --> 00:12:59,723
Crank letter writer.

87
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:01,831
Then how the hell did he get
anywhere near the President?

88
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:04,925
Because they don't assign agents
to high-level threat cases...

89
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:08,513
unless they live in the immediate area.
Detimore's not from here.

90
00:13:09,544 --> 00:13:12,730
So you don't know anything
that anybody else doesn't know.

91
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:15,201
Bite me, Peter. The guy's a ghost.

92
00:13:15,566 --> 00:13:18,225
He has no bank statements,
he has no credit records.

93
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,102
He paid his rent in cash.

94
00:13:20,206 --> 00:13:23,067
And, oddly enough,
his personal history's been erased...

95
00:13:23,168 --> 00:13:25,333
since he left the army in '92.

96
00:13:26,888 --> 00:13:28,986
I'm gonna go back to the campus.

97
00:13:29,092 --> 00:13:32,380
See if I can talk to anyone
who saw him yesterday.

98
00:13:32,482 --> 00:13:34,513
Get a different take on it.

99
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:40,117
Fine, but I want daily reports.
Not your usual out-of-contact-for-weeks.

100
00:13:44,396 --> 00:13:46,887
You know, an e-mail would also
work for me.

101
00:13:59,568 --> 00:14:01,599
It's not gonna last forever, you know?

102
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:05,490
Don't worry about it, Bri.
I understand procedure.

103
00:14:07,401 --> 00:14:08,748
To be honest with you...

104
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:11,283
I could use the time
to get my head on straight...

105
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:13,123
think things through.

106
00:14:13,293 --> 00:14:16,221
Hey, hey, cut yourself some slack, man.

107
00:14:17,932 --> 00:14:22,432
We've gone over every second of that day.
You did everything by the book.

108
00:14:25,503 --> 00:14:27,960
Stevens was looking for you earlier.

109
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:33,228
Listen. If you need anything, call me.

110
00:14:33,961 --> 00:14:35,004
Okay?

111
00:14:43,012 --> 00:14:44,189
Come in.

112
00:14:45,216 --> 00:14:46,854
I heard you were looking for me, sir?

113
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:50,315
Agent Thomas,
I know you're required to take time off.

114
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,581
But keep in touch,
because when all this clears...

115
00:14:52,688 --> 00:14:54,595
- I'm gonna need you back.
- Yes, sir.

116
00:14:54,695 --> 00:14:57,523
And do not blame yourself
for what happened.

117
00:14:59,171 --> 00:15:02,358
It wouldn't have changed direction
if it didn't go through my hand first, sir.

118
00:15:02,462 --> 00:15:03,842
Now, listen.

119
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:08,714
You took a bullet for the man.
Nobody can ask for more than that.

120
00:15:08,814 --> 00:15:10,025
Yes, sir.

121
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:38,663
Please stop at that area, but just stay back.

122
00:15:38,763 --> 00:15:40,076
Thank you.

123
00:15:41,956 --> 00:15:44,413
- That's far enough.
- All right. Okay.

124
00:15:47,057 --> 00:15:49,749
Don't mind him.
He's always out here begging.

125
00:15:49,855 --> 00:15:51,594
He won't bother you.

126
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:53,836
Okay. Thanks.

127
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,678
Excuse me?

128
00:16:02,164 --> 00:16:03,207
Hi.

129
00:16:03,612 --> 00:16:07,652
- May I talk with you for a minute?
- Arthur Fuller's the name.

130
00:16:08,351 --> 00:16:10,808
My friends call me Shakey.

131
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,441
My name's Kate.

132
00:16:14,736 --> 00:16:17,193
- Cool kicks, Shakey.
- Zip-a-dee-doo.

133
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,110
It's a look.

134
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:23,983
Were you here
when the President was assassinated?

135
00:16:24,082 --> 00:16:25,159
Yeah.

136
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:27,797
Bad scene.

137
00:16:28,163 --> 00:16:30,755
Did you see the shooter here, that day?

138
00:16:40,308 --> 00:16:41,283
No.

139
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,807
Not around here.

140
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,636
Wait, wait. Sorry?

141
00:16:48,371 --> 00:16:51,031
When you say
that you didn't see him around here...

142
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,043
do you mean
that you haven't seen him at all...

143
00:16:53,143 --> 00:16:54,882
or that you've seen him somewhere else?

144
00:16:54,986 --> 00:16:56,366
I've seen him where he lived.

145
00:16:56,467 --> 00:16:58,409
Where? Where have you seen him?

146
00:16:58,869 --> 00:17:02,549
Well, for $20, I'll show you.

147
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,514
Shangri-la.

148
00:17:18,879 --> 00:17:22,559
- You sure he was living here?
- Scout's honor.

149
00:17:24,212 --> 00:17:25,715
Cross my heart.

150
00:17:27,305 --> 00:17:29,998
- That's my home away from home.
- It's nice.

151
00:17:30,102 --> 00:17:32,167
Yeah, wait until you see the inside.

152
00:17:38,988 --> 00:17:40,727
Hey, boss. You got company.

153
00:17:40,832 --> 00:17:42,829
- How many?
- Two. Man and a woman.

154
00:17:48,994 --> 00:17:52,012
Your boy was living there about a week.

155
00:17:53,536 --> 00:17:55,736
Did you tell anyone else about this?

156
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:00,439
No. Nobody ever asks me nothing.
I don't volunteer nothing.

157
00:18:02,817 --> 00:18:03,860
Yeah.

158
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,104
Okay, look.

159
00:18:08,905 --> 00:18:11,991
Can you stand out here and keep watch?
Let me know if anyone comes, okay?

160
00:18:12,097 --> 00:18:14,038
- I can do that.
- All right.

161
00:18:14,138 --> 00:18:16,999
Buy yourself a couple of beers
or something. Okay?

162
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,547
I don't drink.

163
00:18:20,786 --> 00:18:21,830
Okay.

164
00:18:28,652 --> 00:18:30,458
I'll give you another $20
when I come out, okay?

165
00:18:30,561 --> 00:18:31,638
Yeah.

166
00:19:54,781 --> 00:19:57,306
- Hey.
- Hey, boss.

167
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,001
Listen, a last question.

168
00:20:01,298 --> 00:20:03,665
Did you ever see him with anyone?

169
00:20:04,589 --> 00:20:08,797
Oh, yeah. Yeah, twice. Twice!
I seen a guy go into the place.

170
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,572
Okay, great, that's great.

171
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:13,111
- Would you recognize him again?
- Yeah, yeah.

172
00:20:13,277 --> 00:20:15,341
- Did you run her plates?
- Yes, sir.

173
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,884
Give me a few hours
and I'll have her life's history.

174
00:20:20,123 --> 00:20:23,310
Look, I gotta go, okay? But thank you.

175
00:20:23,414 --> 00:20:25,377
- Thank you for all your help. All right?
- Yeah.

176
00:20:25,487 --> 00:20:27,720
- Okay.
- Come back, I'll buy you dinner.

177
00:20:28,318 --> 00:20:30,685
Okay. How much will that cost me?

178
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:58,923
- Yeah?
- Hey, it's Kate. Okay, listen.

179
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,257
Detimore wasn't working alone
on this thing.

180
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:04,715
A third party rented him an apartment.
They paid cash.

181
00:21:05,442 --> 00:21:09,583
Two weeks before the shooting,
it's near campus and it's under a false name.

182
00:21:09,687 --> 00:21:11,853
And I met a guy named Shakey...

183
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:16,065
and he lives in a van behind the building,
but he swears he can lD him.

184
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:20,769
Shakey? Let me guess.
Drunk, needs a shower, not all there.

185
00:21:21,403 --> 00:21:24,063
Yeah, but he knows what he saw
and I believe him.

186
00:21:24,168 --> 00:21:26,233
And listen, I went into the apartment...

187
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,717
and I found cough syrup,
and bloody tissues, and painkillers.

188
00:21:31,244 --> 00:21:32,254
Which means?

189
00:21:32,594 --> 00:21:35,713
Which means he had lung cancer.
I saw the same thing with my mom.

190
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,970
Right.

191
00:21:40,163 --> 00:21:42,194
So maybe the guy wanted to go out
in a blaze of glory.

192
00:21:42,664 --> 00:21:44,168
Or someone found out and used him.

193
00:21:44,277 --> 00:21:46,218
Go back to Shakey's,
find out what else he knows.

194
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:47,328
Okay.

195
00:22:16,465 --> 00:22:18,529
- Hold it, ma'am.
- Kate Crawford, Washington Inlander.

196
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:19,714
Okay.

197
00:22:25,614 --> 00:22:26,825
Hold it.

198
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,469
Okay, this goes in the back. I'll radio ahead.

199
00:22:41,313 --> 00:22:43,747
So, Shakey tells me
that he can identify someone...

200
00:22:43,847 --> 00:22:45,721
that's going in and out
of Detimore's apartment...

201
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:48,155
and, the next thing you know,
he's killed in a fire.

202
00:22:48,257 --> 00:22:49,637
That's not a coincidence.

203
00:22:49,738 --> 00:22:52,690
If he was murdered,
you're playing with big-boys rules now.

204
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,269
I've played big-boy rules before.

205
00:22:54,378 --> 00:22:56,443
Yeah, and my head ended up
on the chopping block.

206
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,985
Yeah, but we also won a Pulitzer.

207
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,137
True.

208
00:23:03,725 --> 00:23:06,586
But this Pulitzer could end up killing you.

209
00:23:06,721 --> 00:23:10,300
- Maybe we should bring in the authorities.
- No. Come on, not yet.

210
00:23:10,407 --> 00:23:14,155
It just... They'd only shut me out
and then I'd have nothing.

211
00:23:15,804 --> 00:23:17,015
I located his sister.

212
00:23:17,121 --> 00:23:20,734
She... She lives near Warren.
I'm gonna go see her tomorrow.

213
00:23:26,303 --> 00:23:29,557
Listen, Kate. Be careful.

214
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:35,283
Yeah, yeah. Anything for you.
I'll see you later.

215
00:24:02,768 --> 00:24:05,563
Get Air Med over here, now!

216
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,434
- Hi.
- Alex, please.

217
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:19,024
Now that he's gone,
you're the only one I can talk to.

218
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:20,704
Not right now.

219
00:25:10,368 --> 00:25:11,546
Hold on.

220
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,606
- Are you Thelma Detimore?
- And you are?

221
00:26:54,533 --> 00:26:57,977
I'm Kate Crawford
from the Washington Inlander.

222
00:26:59,898 --> 00:27:03,252
Look, I been talking to the cops all day
and I'm tired.

223
00:27:03,353 --> 00:27:06,079
You here to make him into a monster, too?

224
00:27:06,348 --> 00:27:09,894
- I'm here to get the truth.
- He was a good brother and a good son.

225
00:27:10,001 --> 00:27:12,301
- Who is it, Thelma?
- A reporter.

226
00:27:12,404 --> 00:27:14,468
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

227
00:27:15,563 --> 00:27:16,573
Is that your mother?

228
00:27:16,683 --> 00:27:19,544
She's an old lady who just outlived her son.

229
00:27:19,907 --> 00:27:21,354
Leave her be.

230
00:27:23,956 --> 00:27:25,000
Okay.

231
00:27:26,194 --> 00:27:28,528
You know what? Just one question.

232
00:27:31,229 --> 00:27:33,394
How long was he taking these?

233
00:27:35,409 --> 00:27:36,789
Long enough.

234
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:42,440
Got it during the Gulf War.
At least that's what he always said.

235
00:27:43,735 --> 00:27:46,787
All right, look, if you think of anything...

236
00:27:47,158 --> 00:27:50,771
you know, you'd like me to know or...
Just give me a call.

237
00:27:51,831 --> 00:27:53,278
I'll do that.

238
00:27:54,431 --> 00:27:55,901
Okay, bye-bye.

239
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:06,502
Delia, could you give me
a hand with this, please?

240
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:17,129
Follow her and find out who she talks to.

241
00:28:57,457 --> 00:28:59,656
Thelma, the TV's broke.

242
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,751
Mom! We gotta get out.

243
00:29:37,806 --> 00:29:40,140
- Sir.
- Martin.

244
00:29:42,283 --> 00:29:43,887
Very nice turnout.

245
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,054
- Where's Thomas?
- At home, I'm sure.

246
00:29:47,417 --> 00:29:50,536
Taking a little time
to get himself together, sir.

247
00:29:50,741 --> 00:29:52,210
Understandable.

248
00:29:53,045 --> 00:29:54,851
It's a difficult time.

249
00:30:07,427 --> 00:30:11,770
- How's the investigation going?
- We're in the opening stages.

250
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,712
A lot of questions to be asked,
people to interview.

251
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:18,578
The big question is
how did he get through the security?

252
00:30:18,682 --> 00:30:20,129
I have my top people on it, though.

253
00:30:20,229 --> 00:30:22,821
Your top people are the ones
that screwed it up in the first place.

254
00:30:22,928 --> 00:30:25,621
- You know, with all due respect, sir--
- Stuff it.

255
00:30:25,726 --> 00:30:28,744
He was a very close,
personal friend of mine...

256
00:30:29,016 --> 00:30:32,495
not to mention that he was
a damn fine leader.

257
00:30:33,591 --> 00:30:35,958
Now, I want this thing cleared up.

258
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:39,642
I thought you were retired, General?

259
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:43,294
You want to find out
how little that really means?

260
00:30:43,629 --> 00:30:45,570
Good afternoon, everyone.

261
00:30:45,702 --> 00:30:48,631
I just want to thank you all
for coming today.

262
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:51,659
And I know that all of your condolences...

263
00:30:51,758 --> 00:30:56,494
both on a personal and professional level,
would have meant a great deal to him.

264
00:30:56,597 --> 00:30:58,830
And I also hope that in time...

265
00:30:59,163 --> 00:31:02,383
this sorrow will turn into
an enduring memory...

266
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:06,067
of all of his great accomplishments
while serving as your President.

267
00:31:23,945 --> 00:31:25,258
Mr. Thomas?

268
00:31:26,941 --> 00:31:28,085
Hello?

269
00:31:41,421 --> 00:31:42,734
Mr. Thomas?

270
00:31:46,391 --> 00:31:47,535
Hello?

271
00:31:53,138 --> 00:31:54,249
Hello?

272
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:02,773
Hello?

273
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,356
Shit.

274
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,273
Good morning.

275
00:32:17,887 --> 00:32:19,424
Long night, huh?

276
00:32:25,226 --> 00:32:28,211
I was wondering if I could just talk to you...

277
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,984
for a second?

278
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:48,219
Listen, I just need to speak to you
for a moment.

279
00:32:51,687 --> 00:32:53,651
Look who she's run to now.

280
00:32:54,254 --> 00:32:55,859
- Trouble.
- Yeah.

281
00:32:56,657 --> 00:32:57,970
Call Jack.

282
00:33:04,193 --> 00:33:06,358
- Yeah?
- She's with Alex Thomas.

283
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,955
That's a shame.

284
00:33:09,624 --> 00:33:13,372
I gave her opportunity after opportunity
to go away, didn't l?

285
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:17,248
I don't have a choice,
so just make them both go away.

286
00:33:17,588 --> 00:33:18,732
Thomas.

287
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:24,129
Look.

288
00:33:25,454 --> 00:33:28,013
Detimore wasn't working alone in this.

289
00:33:28,877 --> 00:33:30,347
I can prove it.

290
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:34,395
Come on!

291
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,341
I'm coming in.

292
00:34:02,447 --> 00:34:06,419
- Well, is this your wife?
- That's none of your business, Crawford.

293
00:34:11,596 --> 00:34:12,942
Pretty lady.

294
00:34:27,854 --> 00:34:29,560
You were close to the President.

295
00:34:29,664 --> 00:34:31,829
You're just wasting your time.

296
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,450
You'll forgive my cynicism...

297
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,960
but I don't buy into any grassy-knoll,
second-gunman theory.

298
00:35:24,001 --> 00:35:25,807
I was there. Remember?

299
00:35:27,983 --> 00:35:32,225
Well, what about the
someone-put-a-dying-man-up-to-it theory?

300
00:35:33,578 --> 00:35:35,811
You really should be going now.

301
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,644
You know, Thomas,
you don't have to like me.

302
00:35:38,745 --> 00:35:42,156
But you know my reputation.
I'm not some bright-eyed rookie.

303
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:43,803
Rookie? No, no.

304
00:35:43,913 --> 00:35:46,673
You have plenty of experience
destroying people's careers...

305
00:35:46,776 --> 00:35:48,347
for your personal gain.

306
00:35:48,454 --> 00:35:50,418
Only when they deserve it.

307
00:35:52,042 --> 00:35:53,881
Okay, fine. I'll leave.

308
00:35:54,346 --> 00:35:56,803
Explain this to me though, will you?

309
00:35:57,472 --> 00:36:00,300
Why would someone
rent an apartment for Detimore...

310
00:36:00,401 --> 00:36:02,398
two weeks before
the National Merit Awards...

311
00:36:02,508 --> 00:36:04,875
one week
before the White House announces...

312
00:36:04,976 --> 00:36:07,343
the President's going to be there?

313
00:36:07,576 --> 00:36:09,775
You just mull that over, okay?

314
00:36:12,019 --> 00:36:16,193
Oh, and the bum who showed me
the apartment is dead, as of yesterday.

315
00:36:30,153 --> 00:36:31,197
Okay.

316
00:36:37,031 --> 00:36:38,378
- Okay.
- Okay.

317
00:36:41,343 --> 00:36:44,170
Can we get my purse? I left it on the dock.

318
00:36:50,163 --> 00:36:53,945
- So, why me?
- Because I need your help.

319
00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:57,926
And there's a conspiracy here
and I know you're not involved.

320
00:36:58,029 --> 00:37:00,396
Wait. Why are the lights still on?

321
00:37:03,295 --> 00:37:06,739
Okay, I don't mean to be rude, Thomas,
but you really need to fix this.

322
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,847
In case you have company here.

323
00:37:44,236 --> 00:37:46,009
Keep your eyes on the water.

324
00:37:46,113 --> 00:37:48,738
- Shoot them if they come back up.
- Okay.

325
00:38:49,598 --> 00:38:52,325
I knew. I told you.
I told you I was being followed.

326
00:38:52,429 --> 00:38:53,573
Aren't you supposed
to listen to your instincts?

327
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,655
Crawford...

328
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:55,741
- What?
- Calm down.

329
00:38:55,852 --> 00:38:56,996
- Okay. I'm calm.
- Calm down.

330
00:38:57,102 --> 00:38:59,268
You're supposed to listen to your instincts
and I always do.

331
00:38:59,373 --> 00:39:01,505
I always say,
"Just listen to your instincts, Kate, listen."

332
00:39:01,611 --> 00:39:03,485
And I didn't listen.
And whenever you don't listen...

333
00:39:03,586 --> 00:39:05,819
- things happen, bad things happen--
- Relax. They're gone.

334
00:39:05,922 --> 00:39:08,717
They're go... There's one right there.
What do you mean, they're gone?

335
00:39:08,818 --> 00:39:10,030
Come on.

336
00:39:10,267 --> 00:39:12,668
You need to check the trees,
then check the car.

337
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:15,101
- Okay.
- And can you get my purse, please?

338
00:39:15,665 --> 00:39:16,944
Thank you.

339
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,266
Excuse me, sir.

340
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,225
- You should've stayed and backed them up.
- I'm sorry.

341
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:53,081
- Like I said, I don't do wet work.
- Yeah, you did, didn't you?

342
00:39:57,198 --> 00:40:00,026
All right, so we take a different approach.

343
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:04,241
We find out who can lead them to us
and we just get there first.

344
00:40:09,968 --> 00:40:12,369
- Thanks for doing this for me.
- No problem.

345
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:15,196
The police lD'd the guys
who tried to kill you yesterday.

346
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,420
Eli Arman.
Arrested twice for illegal arms dealing.

347
00:40:18,525 --> 00:40:22,599
And his pal, Nick Gower, no convictions.
But I got lucky.

348
00:40:22,738 --> 00:40:25,756
Their sidekick on the second bust,
Tony Morino...

349
00:40:25,865 --> 00:40:28,423
is doing 10 years at the federal pen.

350
00:40:28,827 --> 00:40:31,452
- ls there any way that you could--
- They're expecting you.

351
00:40:31,558 --> 00:40:33,432
Here's your clearance.

352
00:41:23,788 --> 00:41:26,448
Eli Arman. He's dead.

353
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,316
I'm all broke up.

354
00:41:29,416 --> 00:41:32,076
Who were you and Eli smuggling guns for?

355
00:41:33,102 --> 00:41:37,412
- All right, what's in this for me?
- You got eight years left, no parole.

356
00:41:37,545 --> 00:41:41,260
I can get you out of this rat hole
and into a minimum-security facility.

357
00:41:41,363 --> 00:41:45,335
- And for this I got to do what?
- Just answer the fucking question.

358
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:57,681
Me and Nick Gower worked for Arman.
But he wasn't running the show.

359
00:41:58,049 --> 00:41:59,227
Who was?

360
00:42:01,966 --> 00:42:04,131
I don't know. It's compartmented.

361
00:42:04,237 --> 00:42:05,516
This way, if one guy got busted...

362
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:07,885
he didn't take everybody else
down with him.

363
00:42:07,989 --> 00:42:12,264
Now, Arman, he worked for Mike Maguire,
and he reported to the top guy.

364
00:42:12,365 --> 00:42:14,733
Where do I find this Mike Maguire?

365
00:42:14,867 --> 00:42:18,446
Last I remember,
he was living in the DC area...

366
00:42:18,553 --> 00:42:22,401
Iiked to hang out at a place
called the Stars and Stripes Cafe.

367
00:42:22,634 --> 00:42:25,653
- So when am I getting out of here?
- As soon as your information checks out.

368
00:42:25,761 --> 00:42:26,715
Let's go.

369
00:42:33,067 --> 00:42:34,346
Thank you.

370
00:42:37,872 --> 00:42:41,755
- You visited a Thelma Detimore yesterday?
- Yeah, why?

371
00:42:43,105 --> 00:42:45,069
Her trailer was blown up.

372
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,887
- What about her mom?
- She was in it.

373
00:42:54,097 --> 00:42:55,241
Oh, my God.

374
00:42:58,836 --> 00:43:02,090
That's three people dead
because I went to go talk to them.

375
00:43:02,293 --> 00:43:04,750
It's not gonna get any better, Kate.

376
00:43:13,153 --> 00:43:16,105
Good girl, Janice. Mike Maguire.

377
00:43:18,551 --> 00:43:21,345
Mike Maguire. Mike Maguire?

378
00:43:23,355 --> 00:43:26,935
You know, this guy looks so familiar to me.
I just can't place him.

379
00:43:29,905 --> 00:43:32,339
You think he's gonna show up today?

380
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:36,481
His favorite haunt.
Good a place to start as any.

381
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,165
It's a needle in a haystack.

382
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:52,018
Hey, looks like our needle just showed up.

383
00:44:05,054 --> 00:44:06,367
Oh, my God.

384
00:44:20,983 --> 00:44:22,027
Move!

385
00:44:23,189 --> 00:44:24,636
Call the cops.

386
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,991
Hello? Yes.
A man just ran by me with a gun.

387
00:44:30,133 --> 00:44:31,310
Get out!

388
00:44:32,141 --> 00:44:34,082
53-31, copy that.

389
00:45:05,743 --> 00:45:08,402
Freeze! Freeze!

390
00:45:10,515 --> 00:45:12,479
Here comes my little hero.

391
00:45:14,201 --> 00:45:16,142
Freeze! Drop your weapon!

392
00:45:24,108 --> 00:45:26,936
Freeze! Drop your gun, now!

393
00:45:29,045 --> 00:45:30,458
Secret Service!

394
00:45:30,558 --> 00:45:32,364
Put your gun down, now!

395
00:45:32,467 --> 00:45:34,599
- Secret Service. Check the lD.
- Put the gun down, now!

396
00:45:34,705 --> 00:45:36,669
Step over to the car, sir.

397
00:45:41,846 --> 00:45:43,585
This is 53-31 calling.

398
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:46,641
We apprehended an armed man,
Special Agent Alex Thomas.

399
00:45:48,989 --> 00:45:50,200
Look out!

400
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:24,523
- I owe you one.
- Maguire's dead.

401
00:46:24,961 --> 00:46:26,240
He's dead.

402
00:46:27,363 --> 00:46:29,697
- Thomas, you're bleeding.
- Yeah.

403
00:46:31,905 --> 00:46:33,218
Sir, are you okay?

404
00:46:43,398 --> 00:46:45,832
The tags were stolen off a Beamer
three days ago.

405
00:46:45,932 --> 00:46:47,839
But that bumper you described...

406
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:51,687
is a chrome, titanium steel, drop bumper,
very rare.

407
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:54,415
Only 35 body shops are qualified
to install them.

408
00:46:54,521 --> 00:46:56,125
Only one in DC.

409
00:46:56,232 --> 00:46:57,702
I accessed their records...

410
00:46:57,812 --> 00:47:01,133
and a company called Alexis lnternational
came up as the owner.

411
00:47:01,234 --> 00:47:03,366
Good girl. What else you got?

412
00:47:03,669 --> 00:47:06,597
Very little. Import-export, unlisted number.

413
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:08,301
May l?

414
00:47:09,691 --> 00:47:12,148
Thanks. Alexis rings a bell.

415
00:47:13,377 --> 00:47:16,731
I think maybe their name
may have come up...

416
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:18,774
in an article I wrote years ago.

417
00:47:20,156 --> 00:47:22,815
- What's lSG?
- lntelligence Studies Group.

418
00:47:22,921 --> 00:47:27,061
Top secret ClA unit that was busted
for doing internal operations.

419
00:47:27,232 --> 00:47:29,756
Illegal internal operations in this country.

420
00:47:29,864 --> 00:47:32,197
And how is lSG tied in to Alexis?

421
00:47:33,121 --> 00:47:34,625
Okay. May l?

422
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:38,183
These three guys
were questioned about lSG.

423
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:40,420
They denied having
any knowledge of it whatsoever.

424
00:47:40,526 --> 00:47:43,746
But, the three of them were employed...

425
00:47:44,146 --> 00:47:46,176
by Alexis lnternational. Okay?

426
00:47:46,285 --> 00:47:50,290
A company with no credit history,
no financial records whatsoever.

427
00:47:52,965 --> 00:47:56,084
- And I knew I recognized him.
- Mike Maguire.

428
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,046
Same guy, different name.

429
00:47:59,151 --> 00:48:01,216
- Can you enlarge that guy's face?
- Sure.

430
00:48:02,574 --> 00:48:04,279
That's Philip Keefer.

431
00:48:05,832 --> 00:48:07,437
That's the driver.

432
00:48:08,036 --> 00:48:10,034
- From today?
- Yes.

433
00:48:11,525 --> 00:48:14,251
I gotta take this in to Stevens tomorrow.

434
00:48:15,572 --> 00:48:16,783
It's him.

435
00:48:24,787 --> 00:48:25,964
Come in.

436
00:48:31,269 --> 00:48:33,401
Agent Thomas, how are you holding up?
How's the hand?

437
00:48:33,507 --> 00:48:35,044
Fine, thank you.

438
00:48:36,238 --> 00:48:37,551
And so what are you doing here?

439
00:48:37,653 --> 00:48:40,582
I don't think Detimore
was working alone, sir.

440
00:48:40,681 --> 00:48:43,935
- What makes you think that?
- I've been in contact with Kate Crawford.

441
00:48:44,037 --> 00:48:46,471
Oh, a conspiracy theory.
I see, I'm sorry, I didn't...

442
00:48:46,572 --> 00:48:48,805
Who is it this time, the FBl or the ClA?

443
00:48:48,908 --> 00:48:51,399
Or maybe the Secret Service?
That'd be a new wrinkle.

444
00:48:51,508 --> 00:48:55,054
It was somebody, sir.
They tried to kill us both yesterday.

445
00:48:56,082 --> 00:48:58,023
- Are you kidding me?
- No, sir.

446
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,485
- You have any idea who?
- Maybe.

447
00:49:01,282 --> 00:49:05,882
Some company named Alexis lnternational
is involved, but I think that's just a shell.

448
00:49:08,587 --> 00:49:10,124
Vaughn, I need 15 men.

449
00:49:10,232 --> 00:49:12,891
Alex, hold on a second. You know that
I cannot authorize that for you.

450
00:49:12,996 --> 00:49:15,128
- You shouldn't even be here.
- You always could count on me.

451
00:49:15,234 --> 00:49:17,691
Listen, this is... This is bigger than us.

452
00:49:17,801 --> 00:49:21,875
This is the FBl, the ClA, the NSA.
They all have their hands in this.

453
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,393
- We can't move on this alone.
- Ten.

454
00:49:23,494 --> 00:49:27,399
Now, give me a couple of days
and I'll see what I can do.

455
00:49:27,509 --> 00:49:29,573
- 10 men is all l--
- Two days...

456
00:49:29,681 --> 00:49:32,137
and I will do my best, Agent Thomas.

457
00:49:32,906 --> 00:49:33,949
Okay.

458
00:49:35,275 --> 00:49:38,989
And until then, you will stay out of this.

459
00:50:24,998 --> 00:50:26,636
General Montgomery, sir.

460
00:50:27,006 --> 00:50:28,050
Alex.

461
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:32,067
When am I gonna see you?
What's wrong, son?

462
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,089
You're kidding.

463
00:50:36,187 --> 00:50:39,374
I'll look into it. I'll see what I can do for you.

464
00:50:40,695 --> 00:50:43,321
What about Martin? Have you talked to him?

465
00:50:43,756 --> 00:50:47,110
No, I know you don't want to
get him involved in it...

466
00:50:49,054 --> 00:50:52,936
but this young man would climb
Mount Everest barefooted for you.

467
00:50:54,945 --> 00:50:56,975
I think he's your best bet.

468
00:50:59,551 --> 00:51:01,021
You're welcome.

469
00:51:01,855 --> 00:51:04,873
Hey, come over and see me sometime.

470
00:51:07,515 --> 00:51:08,794
God bless.

471
00:51:18,244 --> 00:51:22,878
This is a lot bigger than a single gunman.
You obviously got somebody worried.

472
00:51:24,067 --> 00:51:25,604
I'm not so sure.

473
00:51:27,129 --> 00:51:29,159
How's the First Lady doing?

474
00:51:30,288 --> 00:51:34,102
Remarkable lady. I mean,
we all know how tough it's been on her...

475
00:51:34,203 --> 00:51:38,243
but she seems to be doing okay,
you know, wanting to get on with her life.

476
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:40,976
That morning when we were in the car...

477
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:46,206
I gave her a look that
everything was gonna be okay, you know?

478
00:51:46,709 --> 00:51:47,752
Yeah.

479
00:51:48,782 --> 00:51:49,825
Then when it happened...

480
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,691
I just can't forget her face.

481
00:51:58,258 --> 00:52:00,693
Having to leave her husband's side.

482
00:52:03,096 --> 00:52:05,788
- Have you called her, man?
- No.

483
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:10,459
But I'm gonna stop by and see her
when this is all over.

484
00:52:12,574 --> 00:52:15,266
How quickly can you get a team together?

485
00:52:21,755 --> 00:52:23,202
Four or five hours.

486
00:52:24,157 --> 00:52:25,268
What does that mean...

487
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,540
you don't know how long
you'll be able to hold him back?

488
00:52:27,646 --> 00:52:31,000
I thought you were omnipotent,
almighty, and powerful.

489
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:38,075
So who's got my back,
after I clean up your mess? Tell me that.

490
00:52:42,026 --> 00:52:43,731
I do love this game.

491
00:52:45,284 --> 00:52:47,942
Hey, guys, finish up, okay?
Let's go. We gotta get out of here.

492
00:52:50,615 --> 00:52:52,085
Here they come.

493
00:53:07,628 --> 00:53:09,164
Let's get going.

494
00:53:20,693 --> 00:53:23,217
When's the next run supposed to be?

495
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:26,477
God, they're fast.

496
00:53:27,965 --> 00:53:29,278
Very fast.

497
00:53:29,841 --> 00:53:32,635
I didn't think they'd get here that quick.

498
00:53:32,967 --> 00:53:35,952
And boys, let's go have some fun.

499
00:54:08,146 --> 00:54:11,040
Kate, I don't know
what we're gonna be up against in there...

500
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:14,719
- so I'm gonna need you to stay in the car.
- Okay.

501
00:54:41,185 --> 00:54:42,296
West side, report.

502
00:54:43,061 --> 00:54:44,238
West side, clear.

503
00:54:44,805 --> 00:54:47,733
- Thomas, assessment.
- They've been tipped-off.

504
00:56:21,026 --> 00:56:22,990
Just like the fourth of July.

505
00:56:24,087 --> 00:56:25,399
Okay, hero.

506
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:28,553
Present for you.

507
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:01,337
Bomb! Get out!

508
00:57:25,624 --> 00:57:28,744
Hey! Come on!

509
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:30,588
- Help me!
- Open up!

510
00:57:31,383 --> 00:57:34,109
Oh, I'm burned! I'm burning down!

511
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:57,308
Thomas!

512
00:58:39,864 --> 00:58:42,815
- What the hell happened?
- You better buckle up.

513
00:58:53,094 --> 00:58:55,091
Son of a bitch.

514
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:27,211
Here, have this on your conscience, then.

515
00:59:31,069 --> 00:59:32,808
Please don't hit him!

516
00:59:39,361 --> 00:59:41,492
Car. Car. Car!

517
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:02,747
Bus. Thomas, there's a bus.

518
01:00:03,549 --> 01:00:05,423
Okay, you see the kids?

519
01:00:11,282 --> 01:00:12,920
It's gonna be on your head.

520
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:17,557
Thomas, stop! Thomas, bus! Stop!

521
01:00:21,911 --> 01:00:22,988
Stop! It's a bus!

522
01:00:23,293 --> 01:00:24,404
So what're you gonna do?

523
01:00:25,893 --> 01:00:28,418
There are children on it! Stop! Let him go!

524
01:00:32,376 --> 01:00:34,339
Well, you lose, you son of a bitch.

525
01:00:42,544 --> 01:00:45,405
- Bang!
- Bye-bye.

526
01:00:51,988 --> 01:00:53,896
Thank you. Thank you.

527
01:01:07,488 --> 01:01:10,708
- You might want to stay here.
- What?

528
01:01:15,617 --> 01:01:16,660
What?

529
01:01:25,554 --> 01:01:28,808
What in the... This is not good.

530
01:01:33,419 --> 01:01:35,584
- What are you doing?
- I owe him one.

531
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:38,708
Not good. This is not good!
This is not good!

532
01:01:39,244 --> 01:01:40,288
Shit!

533
01:01:58,331 --> 01:01:59,508
Stevens.

534
01:02:00,141 --> 01:02:02,900
Miss Crawford,
would you excuse us, please?

535
01:02:03,332 --> 01:02:05,666
What did I tell you this morning?
Give me two days, did I not?

536
01:02:05,767 --> 01:02:08,168
- lt was my idea, sir.
- Shut up. Did I not say that this morning?

537
01:02:08,268 --> 01:02:10,725
- It's all my idea, sir.
- Really? Then how come you knew...

538
01:02:10,835 --> 01:02:13,068
that the assassin's accomplice
would be in that warehouse?

539
01:02:13,172 --> 01:02:14,978
- 'Cause I told him, sir.
- That's right.

540
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:17,672
- And he's only a suspect.
- What are our losses?

541
01:02:18,207 --> 01:02:21,191
Two dead, two wounded,
one critically burned and in lC.

542
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:25,998
- ls he gonna pull through?
- Yes, thanks to Thomas, he has a chance.

543
01:02:29,724 --> 01:02:32,316
Off the record. Off the record.

544
01:02:33,608 --> 01:02:37,984
You two... Three,
did a hell of a job out there today.

545
01:02:39,071 --> 01:02:41,371
Okay, what's the deal with this guy,
the suspect...

546
01:02:41,472 --> 01:02:42,650
or "not the suspect"?

547
01:02:42,756 --> 01:02:44,664
Still unconscious and in critical condition.

548
01:02:44,763 --> 01:02:46,143
All right. Well, we'll need him alive.

549
01:02:46,244 --> 01:02:48,700
- Call me when he can talk.
- Yes, sir.

550
01:02:48,909 --> 01:02:50,581
- Miss Crawford.
- Mr. Stevens.

551
01:02:50,687 --> 01:02:53,446
- Can I speak with you, please?
- Of course.

552
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:59,601
Wonder Woman.
Remarkable what you did today, thank you.

553
01:02:59,703 --> 01:03:00,780
I appreciate that.

554
01:03:00,888 --> 01:03:02,661
And you have an article to write,
do you not?

555
01:03:02,764 --> 01:03:04,795
Yes, and a very good one, at that.

556
01:03:05,232 --> 01:03:09,339
Now, since you're so intimately involved
in all of this...

557
01:03:10,562 --> 01:03:14,736
could you spare the details to the public,
until I get to the bottom of it?

558
01:03:15,565 --> 01:03:17,595
The public has a right to know.

559
01:03:17,704 --> 01:03:21,586
I'm not ordering you. I wouldn't, I couldn't.
I'm asking you.

560
01:03:23,134 --> 01:03:26,949
And in return, I will give you
an exclusive one-on-one with me.

561
01:03:27,544 --> 01:03:29,507
- Before anyone else?
- Yes.

562
01:03:30,208 --> 01:03:32,014
- Full disclosure?
- Yes.

563
01:03:32,446 --> 01:03:33,792
- Deal.
- Deal.

564
01:03:41,035 --> 01:03:44,783
- What did he say?
- Well, overall, I'd say it went pretty well.

565
01:03:45,412 --> 01:03:47,679
For now. Let's get out of here.

566
01:03:49,888 --> 01:03:51,986
Hey, take my car.

567
01:03:52,651 --> 01:03:55,479
I'll find another ride. Look after it, will you?

568
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:57,027
Thanks, Brian.

569
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:23,841
This way.

570
01:04:24,046 --> 01:04:25,123
Pull!

571
01:04:31,121 --> 01:04:32,164
Pull!

572
01:04:34,444 --> 01:04:36,150
Great shot, General.

573
01:04:37,637 --> 01:04:39,207
Thank you, Alex.

574
01:04:40,599 --> 01:04:45,267
I didn't realize
you were bringing a journalist with you.

575
01:04:45,469 --> 01:04:46,512
Sir.

576
01:04:48,233 --> 01:04:51,128
- Miss Crawford. No offense.
- None taken, General.

577
01:04:51,227 --> 01:04:53,561
We're working together on this one, sir.

578
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:56,525
Really? What you got for me?

579
01:04:56,855 --> 01:04:58,852
His name is Philip Keefer.

580
01:05:01,132 --> 01:05:03,230
I put him in the hospital yesterday.

581
01:05:06,858 --> 01:05:08,799
His name is Jack Baldwin.

582
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,165
- Not Keefer?
- No.

583
01:05:12,223 --> 01:05:15,443
He's a former contract employee for the ClA.

584
01:05:17,850 --> 01:05:19,522
You mean contract killer?

585
01:05:21,206 --> 01:05:24,426
Ten years ago,
he was a deputy director's man.

586
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:27,615
He virtually ran the lSG.

587
01:05:28,018 --> 01:05:29,196
General?

588
01:05:30,914 --> 01:05:33,506
Who was the deputy director
of operations then?

589
01:05:34,271 --> 01:05:35,741
Vaughn Stevens.

590
01:05:36,903 --> 01:05:38,081
Stevens?

591
01:05:39,174 --> 01:05:43,347
I know where you're headed with this,
but I'll stake my reputation.

592
01:05:43,583 --> 01:05:47,229
The ClA had nothing to do
with the assassination of the President.

593
01:05:47,335 --> 01:05:50,588
As a matter of fact,
the President was very close to the ClA.

594
01:05:51,613 --> 01:05:53,813
What's curious about all this is...

595
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,378
Baldwin.

596
01:05:57,766 --> 01:06:00,986
I mean, even with him in the picture,
there's no motive.

597
01:06:02,209 --> 01:06:05,362
Question is, who would gain the most...

598
01:06:07,079 --> 01:06:09,244
by the death of the President?

599
01:06:13,168 --> 01:06:15,232
Like to stay for breakfast?

600
01:06:16,195 --> 01:06:20,369
That's very generous of you, sir,
but I think it's best we get going.

601
01:06:21,723 --> 01:06:23,956
- All right.
- Thank you again, General.

602
01:06:24,982 --> 01:06:27,641
Remember, the deeper you dig...

603
01:06:28,766 --> 01:06:31,133
the less you're gonna like what you find.

604
01:07:01,279 --> 01:07:02,456
...understand that, right?

605
01:07:02,562 --> 01:07:05,815
Of course I understand.
I'm in the middle of it as much as you are.

606
01:07:06,709 --> 01:07:08,245
Why didn't you try calling me or something?

607
01:07:08,354 --> 01:07:09,801
- I will, I'll call you Thursday.
- Okay.

608
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,145
- Okay?
- Okay.

609
01:07:11,249 --> 01:07:12,820
Until then, stiff upper lip. All right?

610
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:19,838
- Miss Crawford, aren't you here a bit early?
- lt was light traffic.

611
01:07:20,365 --> 01:07:21,678
Sorry to have surprised you.

612
01:07:21,781 --> 01:07:24,080
- Who was that?
- No one important.

613
01:07:25,597 --> 01:07:26,775
Really?

614
01:07:27,242 --> 01:07:30,889
'Cause it looked like Judy Fincher
from WestLake Publishing.

615
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:35,001
You wouldn't be thinking about reneging
on our promised interview, would you?

616
01:07:35,108 --> 01:07:37,071
I had heard that your editor
pulled the story. So?

617
01:07:37,181 --> 01:07:38,425
- Really, you heard that?
- Yeah.

618
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:41,055
That's odd, I didn't hear that. Who told you?

619
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,301
Surely, you of all people should know...

620
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,890
that the grapevine in this town
reaches a lot of walls.

621
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,354
Well, did the grapevine also tell you
that I'm a freelancer?

622
01:07:49,456 --> 01:07:51,329
So I can give my story
to anyone who wants it.

623
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:54,224
Let me just make this as clear to you
as I possibly can, Miss Crawford.

624
01:07:54,326 --> 01:07:57,546
I am not at liberty to discuss Philip Keefer.
My hands are tied.

625
01:07:57,649 --> 01:07:59,646
- That will not happen.
- That's okay.

626
01:07:59,756 --> 01:08:03,200
Because I'm actually going to change
the angle of the article...

627
01:08:03,309 --> 01:08:05,340
- and do it on Jack Baldwin.
- Good.

628
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:08,537
I'm sorry, I have to take this.

629
01:08:08,641 --> 01:08:11,828
Hello? Yes. I can be right there.

630
01:08:11,931 --> 01:08:13,434
Okay. Bye-bye.

631
01:08:13,544 --> 01:08:17,515
- I'm so sorry. Can I reschedule?
- Of course.

632
01:08:17,625 --> 01:08:18,904
Thank you.

633
01:08:19,171 --> 01:08:20,741
- Hi, Brian.
- Kate.

634
01:08:22,593 --> 01:08:25,813
- What did she want?
- Nothing. Just being a reporter.

635
01:09:15,739 --> 01:09:17,904
- Hello.
- It's Agent Thomas.

636
01:09:18,208 --> 01:09:20,900
Alex. How you doing?

637
01:09:21,005 --> 01:09:22,082
I'm doing.

638
01:09:22,486 --> 01:09:26,099
- I'm really sorry about everything.
- Yeah, me, too.

639
01:09:29,692 --> 01:09:31,229
You meant a lot to him.

640
01:09:31,338 --> 01:09:34,423
- He was gonna divorce her and marry you.
- I know.

641
01:09:35,122 --> 01:09:37,522
I just want the President to be...

642
01:09:37,722 --> 01:09:40,583
remembered as a good President and not...

643
01:09:41,013 --> 01:09:42,549
Still protecting him, huh?

644
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:45,150
Well, don't worry, Agent Thomas.

645
01:09:45,257 --> 01:09:47,198
What happened between me
and the President...

646
01:09:47,298 --> 01:09:49,957
will stay between me and the President.

647
01:09:51,313 --> 01:09:53,344
No one else needs to know.

648
01:09:53,781 --> 01:09:54,958
Thanks.

649
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:58,184
- lf you ever need anything...
- I won't.

650
01:09:58,881 --> 01:10:00,059
Thanks.

651
01:10:35,113 --> 01:10:37,638
Alex, what a surprise.

652
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:42,441
You never forget a thing, do you?

653
01:10:42,945 --> 01:10:46,849
- What have you been up to lately?
- Oh, just working on my boat.

654
01:10:47,354 --> 01:10:50,080
- And you?
- Working on my art.

655
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:52,943
I'm nearly finished.

656
01:10:53,673 --> 01:10:55,906
Been waiting to show it to you.

657
01:11:00,024 --> 01:11:01,662
What do you think?

658
01:11:08,382 --> 01:11:10,940
I think a lot of things, to be honest.

659
01:11:12,069 --> 01:11:14,930
Like maybe there wasn't
just one lone gunman.

660
01:11:15,885 --> 01:11:17,455
What do you mean?

661
01:11:18,354 --> 01:11:20,687
We have a suspect in the hospital.

662
01:11:20,789 --> 01:11:23,874
Whatever is going on,
we'll find out soon enough.

663
01:11:29,411 --> 01:11:31,285
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

664
01:11:32,537 --> 01:11:34,074
It is beautiful.

665
01:11:38,986 --> 01:11:40,591
You're too close.

666
01:11:43,429 --> 01:11:45,034
You can't see it.

667
01:11:48,333 --> 01:11:51,059
You have to see it
from the right perspective.

668
01:12:03,437 --> 01:12:04,682
Try mine.

669
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:23,204
Wow. That is truly amazing.

670
01:12:23,642 --> 01:12:26,436
So, are any of these powdered?

671
01:12:28,348 --> 01:12:31,826
- Have I ever brought you anything else?
- No.

672
01:12:42,202 --> 01:12:44,008
Take care of yourself.

673
01:12:57,339 --> 01:12:59,998
- Here you go.
- Yeah. Thanks a lot.

674
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:15,329
Perfect timing.

675
01:13:23,765 --> 01:13:25,044
Thank you.

676
01:13:38,113 --> 01:13:39,918
Who won the last game?

677
01:13:43,904 --> 01:13:45,811
Are those framed checks?

678
01:13:47,195 --> 01:13:48,238
Yeah.

679
01:14:22,439 --> 01:14:23,976
I'm sorry, Alex.

680
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:31,282
Yeah.

681
01:14:59,856 --> 01:15:01,886
You know what burns my ass?

682
01:15:02,224 --> 01:15:06,163
The fact that Baldwin is still in the hospital
and he's still alive.

683
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:26,147
Thomas, why are you watching
that morbid tape?

684
01:15:26,839 --> 01:15:29,924
We confiscated tapes
from five different cameras.

685
01:15:30,822 --> 01:15:33,088
I'm sure I'm missing something.

686
01:15:36,844 --> 01:15:40,625
- What is that?
- Well it's... My cell phone is dying.

687
01:15:41,944 --> 01:15:44,839
So, I went to interview Stevens today...

688
01:15:46,057 --> 01:15:49,939
and I saw the publisher, Judy Fincher,
coming out of his office.

689
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:52,496
I don't know what that's all about.

690
01:15:53,066 --> 01:15:55,433
But I told him
that I was changing the angle of my story...

691
01:15:55,535 --> 01:15:57,992
from Philip Keefer to Jack Baldwin.

692
01:15:58,891 --> 01:16:01,225
And I could tell it shook him up.

693
01:16:09,159 --> 01:16:11,459
Wait, stop. Pause it. Stop.

694
01:16:13,667 --> 01:16:15,204
Do you see that?

695
01:16:16,498 --> 01:16:20,638
- Detimore is so close to Stevens.
- Yeah, close enough to get a gun.

696
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:23,603
Call the police, the FBl, somebody,
we have to arrest him.

697
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:28,136
It's not enough to arrest him,
but it's definitely enough to confront him.

698
01:16:28,936 --> 01:16:30,249
- Brian.
- Yeah?

699
01:16:30,351 --> 01:16:33,044
- Find out where Stevens is right away.
- Okay, call you back.

700
01:16:33,412 --> 01:16:34,623
Let's go.

701
01:16:35,354 --> 01:16:36,666
You coming?

702
01:16:38,183 --> 01:16:39,158
No.

703
01:16:40,059 --> 01:16:43,773
I can't go with you.
We're the only two that know about this.

704
01:16:45,489 --> 01:16:49,203
If you don't come back,
I'm the only one who knows the truth.

705
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:58,674
Well, then,
I guess the tape's in good hands...

706
01:17:00,823 --> 01:17:02,001
partner.

707
01:17:09,610 --> 01:17:11,146
- Martin.
- Yeah.

708
01:17:11,256 --> 01:17:13,253
- He's at home.
- How do you know he's there?

709
01:17:13,361 --> 01:17:14,831
Well, you know Stevens.

710
01:17:14,941 --> 01:17:18,520
Whenever the wife is out of town,
things get busy at the mansion.

711
01:17:18,627 --> 01:17:20,332
Okay, I'm on my way.

712
01:17:49,494 --> 01:17:50,841
Vaughn, sir?

713
01:17:57,853 --> 01:17:59,458
It's Agent Thomas.

714
01:18:00,749 --> 01:18:02,162
Are you here?

715
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:15,621
Vaughn? It's Agent Thomas.

716
01:18:24,277 --> 01:18:25,421
Vaughn?

717
01:18:39,383 --> 01:18:42,468
- Alex, everything all right?
- ln here.

718
01:18:51,229 --> 01:18:52,340
Jesus.

719
01:18:59,357 --> 01:19:01,096
Looks like a suicide.

720
01:19:02,023 --> 01:19:04,423
Or someone wants us to think that.

721
01:19:06,498 --> 01:19:09,393
When I pulled up,
I saw a woman driving away.

722
01:19:09,493 --> 01:19:12,320
- Get forensics up here.
- I'll make the call.

723
01:19:18,114 --> 01:19:20,976
- Hello.
- Kate, Jesus Christ, where've you been?

724
01:19:21,142 --> 01:19:22,320
- No calls, no fax.
- I know.

725
01:19:22,425 --> 01:19:23,704
I even told you an e-mail would work.

726
01:19:23,808 --> 01:19:26,175
Yes. I'm sending you an e-mail right now
with the whole story.

727
01:19:26,276 --> 01:19:27,353
Yeah, right.

728
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:30,781
Okay, listen, this thing is so much bigger
than any of us thought.

729
01:19:30,882 --> 01:19:35,315
Okay, every lead that I've gone to is dead.
And I almost joined them.

730
01:19:35,424 --> 01:19:37,589
- What?
- So, I'm typing it right now.

731
01:19:37,694 --> 01:19:39,007
You should get it momentarily.

732
01:19:39,702 --> 01:19:42,227
Listen, I gotta go.
My phone is running out of juice.

733
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:44,735
- No, don't hang... Don't.
- Okay, bye.

734
01:19:47,864 --> 01:19:49,602
There were several fluids on his shorts...

735
01:19:49,706 --> 01:19:52,365
but there were no other prints
found at the scene, other than his.

736
01:19:52,470 --> 01:19:56,083
Stevens was murdered.
No way it was a suicide.

737
01:19:56,946 --> 01:19:58,943
Some woman fled the scene.

738
01:20:01,421 --> 01:20:02,868
Wait a minute.

739
01:20:03,133 --> 01:20:05,927
Crawford said she saw him earlier today
with Judy Fincher...

740
01:20:06,028 --> 01:20:07,992
some well-known publisher.

741
01:20:08,135 --> 01:20:11,422
I remember her now.
She was with Stevens at the wake.

742
01:20:13,268 --> 01:20:14,715
- Janice.
- Yes?

743
01:20:14,815 --> 01:20:17,866
Find out what you can on a Judith Fincher.

744
01:20:18,072 --> 01:20:20,900
- F-I-N-C-H-E-R.
- Right away, Alex.

745
01:20:23,963 --> 01:20:25,568
All right. So what do we have?

746
01:20:25,674 --> 01:20:29,489
Detimore is dying of cancer,
hired to kill the President.

747
01:20:30,018 --> 01:20:31,622
Gives the money to his family.

748
01:20:31,729 --> 01:20:34,556
Baldwin comes in
to clean up any loose ends.

749
01:20:34,823 --> 01:20:38,143
Videotape shows
that he probably got the gun from Stevens.

750
01:20:38,245 --> 01:20:40,904
Not to mention a fake press pass.

751
01:20:42,622 --> 01:20:45,247
Stevens would be the perfect one
to engineer it.

752
01:20:45,353 --> 01:20:48,865
Stevens used to handle Baldwin.
Probably got him to do the dirty work.

753
01:20:48,973 --> 01:20:50,510
All the evidence points to Stevens...

754
01:20:50,618 --> 01:20:53,277
making him
the only real loose end to tie up.

755
01:20:53,383 --> 01:20:54,829
Yeah, but why?

756
01:20:54,962 --> 01:20:56,925
What does he have to gain?

757
01:20:57,694 --> 01:21:01,632
Money? Power? He had plenty of both.

758
01:21:01,971 --> 01:21:03,643
Well, why do men do anything?

759
01:21:05,328 --> 01:21:08,346
- Women.
- Right, women.

760
01:21:09,671 --> 01:21:12,196
- What do you got?
- Nothing out of the ordinary.

761
01:21:12,305 --> 01:21:15,132
Graduated Yale Law,
went straight into publishing.

762
01:21:15,233 --> 01:21:16,702
Pretty standard bio.

763
01:21:16,813 --> 01:21:19,640
I printed out some pictures
and a complete business history.

764
01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:22,175
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

765
01:21:22,439 --> 01:21:23,483
Here.

766
01:21:43,008 --> 01:21:45,408
Martin here. What?

767
01:21:45,508 --> 01:21:47,471
Took down two agents before he escaped.

768
01:21:47,582 --> 01:21:49,287
We need you over here right away.

769
01:21:49,391 --> 01:21:51,130
I'll be right there.

770
01:21:53,110 --> 01:21:55,376
Baldwin killed two agents at the hospital
and disappeared.

771
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:57,421
- And they had the place surrounded.
- Let's go.

772
01:21:57,519 --> 01:21:59,819
If he manages to escape
and finds out that Stevens is dead...

773
01:21:59,922 --> 01:22:01,301
he's gonna come after you and Crawford.

774
01:22:01,403 --> 01:22:03,928
Head over to the hospital.
I'll call if I need backup.

775
01:22:21,114 --> 01:22:22,684
Answer the phone.

776
01:22:27,136 --> 01:22:28,146
Hello.

777
01:22:28,255 --> 01:22:29,927
Is everything all right?

778
01:22:30,033 --> 01:22:31,076
Yeah, everything's fine, why?

779
01:22:31,184 --> 01:22:32,395
Baldwin just escaped.

780
01:22:33,258 --> 01:22:34,828
What? Thomas, I can't...

781
01:22:34,935 --> 01:22:36,046
Hello?

782
01:22:40,727 --> 01:22:41,771
Shit.

783
01:22:57,543 --> 01:22:58,653
Hello.

784
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:14,092
Flashlight.

785
01:23:29,496 --> 01:23:31,066
Hello, beautiful.

786
01:23:31,471 --> 01:23:33,636
Help me understand something.

787
01:23:33,807 --> 01:23:36,332
With all the horrible things
going on in the world...

788
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:38,438
why do you concentrate...

789
01:23:38,809 --> 01:23:42,029
on a man who's not worth his weight
in fertilizer, huh?

790
01:23:42,133 --> 01:23:44,792
Talk to me. Come on, tell me why.

791
01:23:46,476 --> 01:23:49,035
Well, now you have nothing to say, huh?

792
01:23:49,472 --> 01:23:51,435
Talk to me! Say something!

793
01:23:54,309 --> 01:23:55,722
Then kiss me.

794
01:24:42,354 --> 01:24:44,721
Kate? Kate.

795
01:25:50,638 --> 01:25:52,668
Thomas! Thomas!

796
01:27:53,416 --> 01:27:56,928
Good god, Alex. What happened?

797
01:27:59,044 --> 01:28:00,580
Stevens is dead.

798
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:02,855
Vaughn Stevens?

799
01:28:03,255 --> 01:28:07,003
- Baldwin's dead, too.
- Baldwin? Who is Baldwin?

800
01:28:07,105 --> 01:28:08,519
What are you talking about?

801
01:28:08,619 --> 01:28:13,354
There's no political motivation,
no financial motivation.

802
01:28:16,123 --> 01:28:18,984
The only motivation I see is a personal one.

803
01:28:19,348 --> 01:28:22,792
- Why bring this to me?
- Because I need to know the truth.

804
01:28:24,875 --> 01:28:26,749
Like I told you before.

805
01:28:27,509 --> 01:28:28,686
You're too close.

806
01:28:28,792 --> 01:28:29,835
You can't see it.

807
01:28:29,944 --> 01:28:32,008
You have to see it
from the right perspective.

808
01:28:32,115 --> 01:28:33,462
Right perspective. Perspective.

809
01:28:33,563 --> 01:28:35,403
Try mine. Perspective.

810
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:52,615
If you can't see it, Alex,
then you're still too close.

811
01:28:54,691 --> 01:28:56,037
Not anymore.

812
01:28:57,783 --> 01:28:58,927
Good.

813
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:02,878
Then you understand.

814
01:29:04,990 --> 01:29:08,535
There's nothing you can do.
You have no proof.

815
01:29:09,894 --> 01:29:12,688
It was always your job to keep his secret.

816
01:29:13,776 --> 01:29:16,143
I just want the President to be...

817
01:29:16,706 --> 01:29:18,669
remembered as a good President.

818
01:29:18,779 --> 01:29:20,618
Still protecting him, huh?

819
01:29:23,057 --> 01:29:24,594
It's over, Alex.

820
01:30:11,036 --> 01:30:13,526
- Wow, you clean up real good.
- Why, thank you.

821
01:30:13,636 --> 01:30:16,497
- You look very handsome yourself.
- Thank you.

822
01:30:18,111 --> 01:30:21,365
Took the liberty of ordering us
a bottle of wine.

823
01:30:22,225 --> 01:30:23,795
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

824
01:30:25,219 --> 01:30:26,397
No ring.

825
01:30:27,885 --> 01:30:30,252
You know, this isn't a date-date.

826
01:30:32,262 --> 01:30:35,740
- You think I'd date you?
- Like you'd ever get the chance.

827
01:30:36,935 --> 01:30:39,627
- Unless.
- Unless?

828
01:30:39,896 --> 01:30:43,509
Unless you tell me
what really happened with Stevens.

829
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:47,325
The whole story.
Because suicide is just too easy.

830
01:30:48,353 --> 01:30:52,258
Well, with Baldwin still alive,
he could've been tied in to the whole thing.

831
01:30:52,368 --> 01:30:55,914
It's just a matter of time.
So, he took the easy way out.

832
01:30:56,054 --> 01:30:58,421
But why do it in the first place?

833
01:30:59,772 --> 01:31:02,464
I don't know.
We're still looking for a motive.

834
01:31:02,569 --> 01:31:04,802
And what if you don't find one?

835
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:10,726
What then, you're just gonna walk away?

836
01:31:10,829 --> 01:31:13,847
Far enough to see things
from a different perspective.

837
01:31:14,548 --> 01:31:17,566
- That's it?
- Unless you know something I don't.

838
01:31:17,674 --> 01:31:18,852
- Thomas, I don't believe it.
- What?

839
01:31:18,957 --> 01:31:20,528
After everything that we've been through...

840
01:31:20,636 --> 01:31:24,541
after everything that's happened to us,
you're still holding out on me?

841
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:30,038
Fine. All right, well,
you know I won't give up.

842
01:31:30,573 --> 01:31:33,199
I'm not the woman that just walks away.

843
01:31:34,786 --> 01:31:38,174
Now, I will find out the truth. I will.

844
01:31:38,274 --> 01:31:40,372
- To the truth.
- To the truth.
