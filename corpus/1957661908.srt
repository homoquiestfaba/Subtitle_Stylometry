00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,726
What can I say, eh? [Speaking Spanish]

165
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,144
They suit me, don't you think?

166
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,645
All right, you feeling yourself.

167
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,732
Your mother always knew
exactly what I needed.

168
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,193
A great talent.
She always picked the perfect pair.

169
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,111
Yeah. She did.

170
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,073
Eh? Why don't you come visit sometime?

171
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,201
Help me keep her flowers blooming?

172
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,255
- Yeah, uh…
- [whispering] Come on. Come on.

173
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,164
Come on. Wrap it up.

174
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,767
[Gustavo] Like Rosie,
we are always here for you. You know that.

175
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,752
Uh, G, we are super late.

176
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,837
- Yeah. So sorry.
- Like, so...

177
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,465
It was kind of you
to interrupt your plans to help me, El.

178
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,884
- Of course.
- You're your mother's son, I see.

179
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,886
- [El] Yes, sir.
- [speaking Spanish]

180
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,638
[Sami] El, the subway! It's coming!

181
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,099
Come on, come on.
We're gonna miss the express.

182
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,225
[El] Come on, come on.

183
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,977
[Sami] Come on. Change, change, change.

184
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,486
[wind whistling]

185
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,654
- <i>Walk.</i>
- [gasps] Let's go.

186
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,989
<i>Walk. Walk.</i>

187
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,074
[both] Run!

188
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:12,659
[El] Come on. [Grunts]

189
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,369
[Sami] Somebody hold the door.

190
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,453
Wait, wait, wait!

191
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,872
[announcer]
<i>Stand clear of the closing doors, please.</i>

192
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:18,957
[sighs]

193
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,584
We made it.

194
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,963
[Sami] I can't believe we stopped
for Gustavo. We almost missed it.

195
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,297
But we didn't. [Sighs]

196
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,801
Yo!

197
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,848
- [Sami] Dude, I hope we get there in time.
- [El] Me too.

198
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:39,561
[sighs] Adidas and King's collab,
the rerelease of the 1984 Adidas Forum.

199
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,814
Darius King's rookie sneaker
is about to be ours.

200
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,275
You see the updated gray colorway, right?
Space gray?

201
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,527
- The shape, the material…
- Oh, my gosh. It's butter!

202
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,613
So butter. It's butter.
This drop is about to be epic.

203
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,782
Butter, butter, butter!
There's no better word.

204
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:56,661
These shoes will change our lives.
I brought my half. You get yours?

205
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,205
Mm-hmm.
Sold my Air Max 97s to my girlfriend.

206
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,707
"Girlfriend." Which one? Hmm?

207
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,043
You got, like, ten of them.

208
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:06,880
Listen, you gotta kiss a lot of lady frogs
before you find a princess, okay?

209
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,882
- Well, until then, you're stuck with me.
- Mmm.

210
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,091
Least your kicks are.

211
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:14,179
I don't care if I have to wear 20 pairs
of socks to share these shoes with you,

212
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,723
as long as I can retire these bad boys,
I'll be happy.

213
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,617
- [El] Let me at them.
- [Sami] You can't clean them.

214
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,841
- I already tried. Stupid fingerprint.
- Let me at them.

215
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,772
Come on. Welcome to the factory.

216
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:41,873
Oh, no.

217
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,668
[whispering] Don't kill me.

218
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,003
El, you're scaring me.

219
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:48,630
Good.

220
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,986
What did you just do to my sneaker?

221
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,781
Oh, I... I was trying to...

222
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,075
Dude, I love it. Do the other.

223
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,910
Okay, um…

224
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,372
Okay.

225
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,968
- Hold very still.
- Okay.

226
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,095
And boom!

227
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,143
[Sami chuckles]

228
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,270
- [growling]
- [Sami laughing] Stop!

229
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:48,148
This is the hottest crime scene
I have ever worn.

230
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,899
Yeah, they'll do.

231
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,257
- [Sami laughs]
- Sami.

232
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,301
What are you doing?

233
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,553
You are just very talented.

234
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:26,311
We could still use this money on materials
for you to make us your own pair instead.

235
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:30,166
What... Don't... Remember the first pair
you made in the sixth grade?

236
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,150
- I swear your mom was ready to call Nike.
- Sami, I don't do that anymore.

237
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:34,778
But you could.

238
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,739
Look, you flipped your kicks
for a pair of real sneakers. All right?

239
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,657
From a legit designer,
not your best friend.

240
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,493
You are a legit designer.

241
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,370
What makes someone legit anyway?

242
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,456
Sami, when's the last time you actually
saw me make a pair of sneakers?

243
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,625
I just scribble in my notebook. That's it.

244
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,836
Mmm. That's funny. I think I hear
your stepfather talking, not you.

245
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,838
Is he wrong? Is he wrong? Hmm?

246
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:57,801
I'm a stock boy. That's it. All right?
And not a very good one at that.

247
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:58,885
Meh.

248
00:11:58,968 --> 00:11:59,968
Ooh.

249
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,431
Come on, come on, come on. Thank you.

250
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:06,434
So, how did you convince the overlord
to let you go today?

251
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,162
I might have locked up
without telling him.

252
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,187
[Sami] Bold.

253
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,350
If we get back in time,
he won't know the difference.

254
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,151
[music playing]

255
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:18,071
Okay,
I think he's gonna know the difference.

256
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,281
[El] "Made to soar."

257
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,034
Can we?

258
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,327
[laughs]

259
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,412
[Sami] Let's go get it.

260
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,831
[El] Oh…

261
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,417
[Sami] Oh… I wanna lick 'em.

262
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,544
[El chuckles] All hail the King.

263
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,463
Okay, but, look, if you are gonna be
in a hurry to get back,

264
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,608
I'm wearing them first,
'cause what you're not gonna do,

265
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:40,468
is scuff our brand-new kicks
on the very first day, okay?

266
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,352
- Sneaker prenup rule number...
- Oh, my gosh.

267
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,973
Whoa, hold up.

268
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,017
Where did you get those King6 shoes?

269
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,768
They almost look like Sleeks.

270
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,478
- Are those player exclusive?
- Oh, uh…

271
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:51,771
[customer 1] Yo, cutters!

272
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,189
Line's back here.

273
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,376
- [customer 2] Yeah, man.
- [customer 3] Get back in the line.

274
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,527
- No.
- [customer 1] Hey, cutters!

275
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,320
Yo, I'm never making it back to work.

276
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,323
- There's like a thousand people.
- [groans] I can see that.

277
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:03,908
- Next group, come on up.
- Let's go.

278
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,511
- Keep moving.
- No, dude, we can't... I...

279
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,221
- [customer] Yo! The line's back there.
- Okay.

280
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,914
Do I need to pull up
and personally make it clear to you?

281
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,876
- It's okay. We're...
- Oh, hey. Coz.

282
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,128
I'm so glad you found me.
I've been waiting for you.

283
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,772
- Y'all cappin'.
- [person] Nobody's cappin'.

284
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,006
- This is our cousin.
- Yeah.

285
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,216
Nah, th-these are my cousins and see,

286
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,635
- I've been saving our spot in line.
- Yeah.

287
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,054
- We're family.
- So, thank you.

288
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,431
- Thank you. Bye. Have a good day.
- [Sami] Thanks.

289
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,100
[customer 1] Whatever. You know they not.

290
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:31,311
[customer 2]
Can we call security? This is messed up.

291
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:34,272
Hey. That was really sweet. Um…

292
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,690
Um, I'm Kira.

293
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:37,859
El.

294
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,864
Hi. I'm Sami. I'm not a part of this, so…

295
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,616
That's my friend, Sami.

296
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,785
- Hi, Sami.
- I just said that thing. Hi.

297
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,512
- [El] I'm sorry.
- I mean, I appreciate the save.

298
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:52,207
Yeah, of course.
I mean, guy's a total hypebeast, right?

299
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,376
He deserves to be cut in line anyway.

300
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,579
- I think he's just amped up.
- Nah, what do you mean?

301
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,046
I mean, you saw his Zebras, right?

302
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,548
[Kira] Yeah.

303
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:03,343
You see how the knit upper
gets darker just as it meets the boots?

304
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,930
It's wet. He probably
scrubbed those shoes down this morning.

305
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,557
- [Sami chuckling]
- He prepped hard-core for this drop.

306
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:12,018
- Wow. I can't believe you noticed that.
- [Sami] Well...

307
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:14,354
El believes that sneakers
are a window to the soul.

308
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:15,522
Kinda like a mood ring.

309
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:16,815
To the soul?

310
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,441
- Show her.
- No.

311
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,544
- It's this trick he does. Really cool.
- It's not a trick.

312
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,248
It's this thing that his mom taught him...

313
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,714
- Stop.
- What did your mom teach you?

314
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:24,864
He's a sneaker psychic.

315
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:27,668
- Okay, El, I have to see this now.
- I'm sorry. It's really nothing.

316
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,328
Hmm. Come on. Show me what you got.

317
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,497
Okay. Okay. All right.

318
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,416
Um…

319
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:35,792
Check out that dude. See him?

320
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,876
- Yeah.
- [El] Okay, um…

321
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:42,257
Sporting a classic.
Thinks "if it ain't broke, don't fix it."

322
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,802
Can't go wrong with the GOAT.
Stable, reliable, good taste,

323
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,847
gives you Christmas gifts
that are actually on your wish lists.

324
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,410
Puts some cash in your birthday card.

325
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,018
Hmm. Not much of a psychic.

326
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,246
You could say that about anybody
and how would we know?

327
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,479
Kick it up a notch.

328
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,899
All right, check her out.

329
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:00,984
Hot pink kicks.

330
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:04,571
She got the colorful base, but she had
to go and heat it up with the laces.

331
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,240
She's fearless.
She laughs in the face of fear.

332
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,284
No way she walks around that busted grate.

333
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,618
Are you joking?

334
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:14,497
I don't know.
No New Yorker steps on those grates.

335
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,001
Yeah, my money's on the sidewalk.

336
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:20,837
[gasps]

337
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,172
- [El] Voilà!
- Oh!

338
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,342
You are amazing! You're amazing!

339
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,136
You are a sneaker psychic.

340
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,305
- Sami, you weren't lying.
- I know.

341
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:31,949
[El] No, I'm just...
You gotta pay attention.

342
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,184
People are telling you
a story about who they are.

343
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,561
That's what a perfect pair of sneakers is.

344
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,896
At least what it can be.

345
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:41,149
You know, you just gotta give somebody
a chance to be real, right?

346
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,236
- But, by your logic…
- Uh-huh.

347
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,823
…why would all these people then line up
to wear the same shoe?

348
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,033
Mmm.

349
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:55,580
I... I guess if you put enough
of yourself into a design, it's gonna hit.

350
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,667
But at the end of the day, once
I slip on that sneaker, it's my story.

351
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,503
[employee] All right. Sorry, everyone.

352
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,981
We're officially sold out of
the Forum sneakers for this drop.

353
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,757
- [all groaning]
- Thanks for coming.

354
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,152
- [Sami] Do you see that guy?
- [El] Did you really need four pairs?

355
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:10,679
- Are you... Is that necessary?
- You have two feet, man.

356
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:11,930
Can I get one?

357
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,431
This is the worst day of my life.

358
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:18,061
I don't know. This is the most fun I've
had talking about kicks in, well, ever.

359
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,064
Yeah, I mean,
this is, like, the most fun I've ever...

360
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,947
We... W-We're so in sync right now.
I mean, it's very... very fun. I...

361
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,026
- Stop.
- Huh?

362
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,630
I think what he's trying to say is
it's really nice to meet you.

363
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:28,988
- Yeah.
- Hey, hold up.

364
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,574
I thought you said she was your cousin.

365
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:35,578
Yeah, we are cousins. We're family.
It's like a family reunion. Because...

366
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,462
- [El] You have friends. Okay…
- So what's up?

367
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:40,583
I have an idea. Hey, how about...
How about we, uh…

368
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,127
- [both] Run!
- [Kira screams]

369
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,254

370
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,547
Come on. Let's go!

371
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:49,193

- [customer 1] You ain't gonna get away!

372
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:51,845

373
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,865

374

- Wait.

379

Up for an adventure? Come on.

380
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,682

Whoa, wait. Where are we even going?

387
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:25,670
- We're going to Queens. Come on.
- [Kira] Queens?

388
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:28,590
You know, when you said "adventure,"

389
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:32,469
I thought you were gonna show me
something, I don't know, new?

390

Oh, so you've seen everything, huh?

sneaker psychic?

00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,527
I don't know what to do.

493
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:44,364
Spray whatever you're feeling right now.
Anything.

494
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:04,759
Let's see what you've got, Manhattan.
Oh, word. That's how you feel?

495
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:12,851
Hmm.

496
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:17,230
That's, uh…

497
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:20,692
- I'm confused.
- [Kira chuckles]

498
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:23,695
- Turn around.
- Hmm?

499
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:26,614
- Made a frame.
- Ah.

500
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:28,283
If the wall is always changing,

501
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:31,119
I wanna make sure I can always
remember what it looks like right now.

502
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:33,872
Cheese.

503
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:39,544
[camera clicks]

504
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:48,386
You know, my dad grew up in Queens.

505
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:50,889
- Really?
- Yeah.

506
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:53,266
I mean, he talks about his roots a lot,

507
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,353
but I can't even remember
the last time he set foot around here.

508
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:02,525
Well, if he needs a refresh,
apparently I'm also a tour guide, so…

509
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:05,737
I'd give you four stars.

510
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,533
What? Come on. Look at this? Come on!
How is this not five-star material?

511
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:14,954
Maybe add in some more sneaker readings,
and I'll consider bumping you up.

512
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:19,626
Okay. It's never enough, never enough
for Manhattan. I get it. I get it.

513
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:24,089
Well, Sami said that your mom
taught you all that. Is it true?

514
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:29,135
Yeah. She, uh... She did.

515
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:32,764
Before she, uh, passed.

516
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:36,601
It's kinda why kicks mean so much to me.

517
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:39,688
It's, like, the only part of her
I have left.

518
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:42,107
I didn't realize.

519
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,942
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.

520
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:46,236
You know…

521
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:49,197
I miss her.

522
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,117
But every day she's with me.

523
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:54,994
Every time I slip on my kicks.

524
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:00,125
That's a pretty cool legacy.

525
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:03,712
I mean, my family is
full of sneaker junkies,

526
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:06,589
but I don't think any of them
see kicks the way you do.

527
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,552
In fact, will you help me with something?

528
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:13,096
For you, Manhattan, anything.

529
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:17,809
Okay. What do these say about me?

530
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:20,937
Uh…

531
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:24,315
And don't go soft on me now, okay?
I can take it.

532
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:27,610
They... They don't really say anything.

533
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:31,531
I mean, they're not bad. They're...
They're just a little…

534
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:33,867
- Basic.
- Hmm.

535
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:39,122
You know, just a little more basic
than I would assume from King. I'm sorry.

536
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,042
So you're saying I'm basic?

537
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:45,837
No. No. No, I didn't mean it like that.
I just mean, you know, the shoe...

538
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,465
Y-You deserve a... a one of one.

539
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:50,550
Uh… [stammering]

540
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:54,095
- What?
- Nah, you're right.

541
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,848
You should've seen your face.
It was so funny.

542
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:00,060
You're right. They are basic.

543
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:03,938
And I was worried about that
because I am not basic.

544
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:07,400
So, if you were worried
they weren't fresh, why'd you cop them?

545
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:09,628
Is that, like, a Manhattan thing?
Y'all do that up there?

546
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:10,862
It's a life thing.

547
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:15,158
Because sometimes you gotta try
something out and hope it surprises you.

548
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:20,997
Today, I tried out these kicks,
and they didn't.

549
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:23,083
- No. At all.
- No. No, not this time.

550
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:28,713
But today, I also tried
going on an adventure with you.

551
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:31,383
And…

552
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,134
Are you surprised?

553
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:36,429
Yeah. And then some.

Oh, sorry. It's my sister.
I was supposed to be home by now.

Is that the time?
No. No, no, no, no. Shoot!

[El] I gotta go.

Do you wanna follow me,
and I can follow you back?

00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:44,622
- Yes. Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

571
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:46,142
About the Sleeks and how I got them.

572
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:48,644
- I should really just tell you.
- Hey, I'm sorry. I gotta catch this.

Hey, wait up. Okay, but I never got your...
El, wait!

- [El] I'm sorry!
- [phone ringing]

- [Liv] <i>Well, where are you?</i>

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,973
Yeah, I'm sorry. I just...

585
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:34,047
[El] Sorry. Excuse me.

586
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:41,388
- Where have you been?
- [gasps]

587
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:45,642
Hey. Uh, look, I'm sorry, okay?
I... I lost track of time.

588
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:46,768
You lost track of time?

589
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:49,104
There should be no time
for you to lose track of.

590
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:52,315
You were supposed to be here. Working.

591
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,735
I know. I had a... I had a thing.

592
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:58,571
I told you I was bringing
someone important here tonight. Right?

593
00:28:58,655 --> 00:28:59,882
- Didn't I tell you that?
- Yes.

594
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:01,157
And what did we find?

595
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:02,492
What?

596
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:05,829
Huh? A dark store, locked door.

597
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:09,207
[scoffs] Totally unimpressive.

598
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,042
- And totally embarrassing.
- I...

599
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:13,003
This is the real world, El!

600
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:17,382
Not some doodle or some nonsense
you're dreaming about. Okay?

601
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:19,676
The real world.
You've got to get yourself right.

602
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:23,346
[sighs] El, I honestly don't get it.

603
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,182
You weren't disappearing and acting up
when your mother was here.

604
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:27,586
She didn't use me as a stock boy.

605
00:29:28,518 --> 00:29:31,479
Okay? And you never even yell at them
when they stick me with their shifts.

606
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:32,564
Don't even.

607
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:34,774
No, you switched the schedule
without even asking me.

608
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:36,026
He does it all the time.

609
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:39,154
Zelly, am I the one that locked up
and left without telling anyone?

610
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:42,073
No, Stacy, remember that was El?

611
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:46,411
No, how about you tell your dad about
how you were supposed to be working...

612
00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:48,079
Hey, listen. That's enough.

613
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:51,041
El, you're gonna take
all the shifts next week.

614
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:52,643
- Hey, hey! Hey... Hey!
- That's not fair!

615
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:54,103
- Hey! And get this place clean.
- Sorry.

616
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:56,796
I have more important people
coming tomorrow.

617
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,299
And until further notice, you're grounded.

618
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:01,384
- I didn't...
- End of story.

619
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:05,680
Boys, let's go. El's closing up tonight.

620
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:07,599
I hope this sinks in.

621
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:09,684
Yikes.

622
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:10,935

625
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,443
Did we or did we not agree
to just stay out of each other's way

00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:20,862
to make this
miserable arrangement tolerable?

627
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:23,448
That doesn't mean that you can just shove
your shifts on me.

628
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:26,284
- Oh, "shove"?
- Why are you always complaining?

629
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:28,554
We're the ones who had to leave
everything behind in Jersey

630
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:29,579
to come out to this dump.

631
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:30,789
This place is not a dump.

632
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:34,334
Are you sure about that, El?
It's not a dump?

<i>Hello, Miss King.
You have reached the penthouse.</i>

681
00:34:24,856 --> 00:34:26,959
[Liv] Mom, the gala committee is getting
completely bombarded

682
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:28,961
- with ticket requests.
- [Mom] The guest list's been closed

683
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:30,236
- for weeks.
- Mom! I'm home.

684
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,947
- [Mom] We're in here, honey.
- Finally.

685
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:35,283
I had the most incredible day.

686
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:38,370
Oh, apparently. So incredible that
you completely missed dinner.

687
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:40,080
And all the gala prep. Hmm.

688
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:43,083
Yeah, I know, but I was at Dad's drop

689
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:45,519
and while I was in line,
I actually met this really handsome...

690
00:34:45,543 --> 00:34:47,253
Whoa, whoa. Honey. You were in line?

691
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:49,657
You could've just called the office
to get yourself a pair.

692
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:51,841
- No.
- You were researching the Sleeks, right?

693
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:54,511
I asked Kira to test out the prototype
for the hybrid.

694
00:34:54,594 --> 00:34:55,720
So you wore them out today?

695
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:56,971
So, what's the word, honey?

696
00:34:57,055 --> 00:34:58,056
- Um...
- I'm telling you,

697
00:34:58,139 --> 00:34:59,891
low-tops are really trending right now.

698
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:01,518
The Sleeks are perfect.

699
00:35:01,601 --> 00:35:03,853
You get me some solid numbers,
and I'll consider it.

700
00:35:03,937 --> 00:35:05,657
Dad, Sneakercon is
only a couple months away

701
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:08,491
and we need to dominate if we wanna
get our numbers up from last year.

702
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:10,860
It's not like the numbers
last year were terrible.

703
00:35:10,944 --> 00:35:12,195
[Mom] No, but it wasn't great.

704
00:35:12,278 --> 00:35:13,738
They were down from the year before,

705
00:35:13,822 --> 00:35:15,424
which was a little down
from the year before that,

706
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:16,592
so we just need something big.

707
00:35:16,616 --> 00:35:19,244
And that's why I'm telling you,
the Sleeks are what King6 needs.

708
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:20,453
- Dad?
- Darius?

709
00:35:20,537 --> 00:35:22,247
I know there's a lot
of pressure right now.

710
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:26,042
This designer is a big deal for us.
He's a proven hit-maker.

711
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:29,045
I do like that he's launched
these big campaigns. I'll say that.

712
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:31,190
[Liv] He's had three
of the biggest launches last year.

713
00:35:31,214 --> 00:35:32,298
You gotta trust me, Dad.

714
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:33,542
Something on your mind, Kira?

715
00:35:35,844 --> 00:35:36,845
Yeah.

716
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:41,182
I just don't think that the Sleeks
are gonna put us back on top.

717
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:43,560
[chuckles] Oh? And why not?

718
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:47,022
They just... They don't say anything.

719
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:48,857
I mean, there's no story behind them.

720
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:53,153
They're... They're not bad,
but they're just a little basic.

721
00:35:53,236 --> 00:35:55,363
Oh, you did not just call me basic.

722
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:57,532
I just... I think that we could do better.

723
00:35:57,615 --> 00:36:01,036
Dad, I mean, we're not exactly tapped
into the street up here.

724
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,412
We need a new voice.

725
00:36:02,495 --> 00:36:04,956
It feels like we need
to find someone fresh.

726
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,793
Okay, I have a pile of research
that says differently.

727
00:36:08,877 --> 00:36:09,878
It's just my opinion.

728
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:12,839
And shouldn't
my opinion count for something?

729
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,841
It does.

730
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,511
Your mother's right.
Problem is, I learned a long time ago,

731
00:36:18,595 --> 00:36:21,973
you cannot run a business
on your opinions alone.

732
00:36:22,057 --> 00:36:24,642
Talent, passion. It's only part of it.

733
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:28,063
You see, my team has experience,
and they do all this research

734
00:36:28,146 --> 00:36:31,941
and if all that says the Sleek is what
we need right now to put us back on top,

735
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:33,193
that's what we doing.

736
00:36:33,276 --> 00:36:35,904
- Dad, come on. Just give me a shot.
- [Mom] Mm-hmm.

737
00:36:35,987 --> 00:36:38,198
[Kira]
You gave Liv a chance when she asked.

738
00:36:38,281 --> 00:36:42,160
I'm really happy that you wanna be
more involved in the family business,

739
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:45,038
but a lot of jobs rely on these decisions.

740
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:48,041
So, you gotta come at me
with something other than,

741
00:36:49,459 --> 00:36:52,045
"They're basic. I'm right."

742
00:36:52,128 --> 00:36:53,773
- You know what I'm saying?
- [Mom] You know what?

743
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:56,257
Babe, it can't hurt to keep looking.

744
00:36:56,341 --> 00:36:58,051
Darius, we have a little time.

745
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:01,805
[sighs]

746
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,103
All right. I don't think
you're gonna find this person,

747
00:37:08,186 --> 00:37:09,270
but I'll let you try.

748
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:11,394
- Wait, wait. What?
- [Darius] So, this is the deal.

749
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,066
- Kira…
- Mm-hmm?

750
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:16,361
…If you find a designer
that we should consider,

751
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:22,659
someone that speaks to you, tells a story
and has the experience to back it up,

752
00:37:22,742 --> 00:37:24,285
we'll try it out.

753
00:37:25,036 --> 00:37:26,287
- Really?
- [grunting]

754
00:37:26,371 --> 00:37:28,331
Dad, this means so much to me.

755
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:31,501
- You did hear me say "and," right?
- Yeah. Yeah, Dad, I did.

756
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:32,669
All right. Good.

757
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:35,755
Now, the gala's in two weeks,

758
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:39,968
and if we haven't found a designer
that changes the game for us by then,

759
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:42,053
we'll go with your sister's Sleeks.

760
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:46,349
- Okay. What's next?
- Well, we have the gala charity auction.

761
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:48,601
- Oh, that's all your mom.
- [exhales]

762
00:37:48,685 --> 00:37:50,103
- I got a call coming.
- [Mom] No.

763
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:51,312
Yeah, I gotta take this.

764
00:37:51,396 --> 00:37:52,522
- Oh. Hey, Dad.
- Yeah?

765
00:37:52,605 --> 00:37:53,605
Thanks.

766
00:37:53,648 --> 00:37:54,983
You got it, kid.

767
00:37:58,153 --> 00:38:00,947
Hey, call the Sneakercon team
and tell them to wait.

768
00:38:01,531 --> 00:38:02,657
We're gonna keep looking.

769
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:11,207
- [El] No.
- [Sami] Yep.

770
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:12,292
[El] No way. No.

771
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:13,376
- Mm-hmm.
- She's...

772
00:38:14,336 --> 00:38:17,756
- No, but... but i-it can't be. It can't be.
- Dude, I didn't... Oh, my Go...

773
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,568
- Look at your face! What is going on?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

774
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:22,177
Sami. No creases.

775
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,887
- You touch it, you buy it.
- Sorry.

776
00:38:24,387 --> 00:38:25,555
God.

777
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:26,639
- Ooh. [Exclaims]
- Sorry.

778
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,477
We were hanging out with Kira King.
Kira King.

779
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,271
Darius King's daughter,
aka, sneaker royalty.

780
00:38:33,355 --> 00:38:34,898
How'd I not know?

781
00:38:34,981 --> 00:38:38,068
I've had the King's poster on my wall
since I was seven. It's the King.

782
00:38:38,151 --> 00:38:40,653
That's crazy.
Like, she's like a princess, yeah?

783
00:38:41,696 --> 00:38:44,199
[gasps] Oh, no, Sami.

784
00:38:44,282 --> 00:38:46,242
- I messed up.
- Don't even worry about it.

785
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:48,745
Like, you would know
who Kira King is by sight. Come on.

786
00:38:48,828 --> 00:38:50,330
- Cute.
- Thanks.

787
00:38:52,665 --> 00:38:56,628
[whispering] Sami, listen. Okay, I dissed
her kicks. Her King6 kicks, all right?

788
00:38:56,711 --> 00:38:57,754
I dissed her father.

789
00:38:57,837 --> 00:39:00,090
Okay, yeah, but what were you gonna do?
Lie to the girl?

790
00:39:00,173 --> 00:39:02,985
- You've gotta call it like you see it.
- Why are you not freaking out like I am?

791
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:05,220
El, you're missing the big picture here,
okay?

792
00:39:05,303 --> 00:39:08,056
Now that we know who she really is…

793
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:11,935
And boom!

794
00:39:15,021 --> 00:39:16,481
- Eh?
- The King's charity gala?

795
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:19,109
Yeah. Now you know how to find her again.
You're welcome.

796
00:39:19,192 --> 00:39:20,485
Okay, okay.

797
00:39:20,568 --> 00:39:22,737
At the most exclusive sneaker event
of the year?

798
00:39:23,738 --> 00:39:25,323
Great idea. It's not gonna happen.

799
00:39:25,407 --> 00:39:28,326
What? Dude, how is this not, like,
the definition of fate?

800
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:31,996
- Oh, come on. You like her. She likes you.
- Hey, you don't know that, okay?

801
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,583
Yeah, okay, I was sweating
from the heat between you two yesterday.

802
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:44,884
[laughs] Stop, all right?
You said you saw, like... like, heat?

803
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:46,469
Just a little bit.

804
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:48,763
Dude, just take a shot.

805
00:39:51,057 --> 00:39:52,535
It's never gonna happen. Not gonna happen.

806
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:53,560
Why?

807
00:39:53,643 --> 00:39:56,813
It's not. I-I-It's just not.
It can't, all right?

808
00:39:56,896 --> 00:39:59,024
It's not scientifically possible,
because I am just...

809
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:00,567
If you say "stock boy"…

810
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,776
I was gonna say "nobody."

811
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,111
Oh, that's nice.

812
00:40:03,194 --> 00:40:05,655
I'm a nobody, and look at her.

813
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:08,366
She's a total somebody.

814
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:11,828
Okay, so you wanna show her
you're a somebody, show off your talent.

815
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:14,748
- Design some sick kicks for the gala.
- Sami, it's in two weeks.

816
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:16,892
- There's not enough time for that.
- Best get to work then.

817
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:18,251
It's not gonna happen.

818
00:40:18,877 --> 00:40:20,795
Look, you can't show up
in your beaters, okay?

819
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:23,548
And I know you wouldn't
wanna do that anyway. Look at them.

820
00:40:23,631 --> 00:40:27,594
This is your shot
to show Miss Kira King who you really are.

821
00:40:27,677 --> 00:40:29,179
Come on.

822
00:40:29,262 --> 00:40:30,513
- Plea...
- [stepfather] El?

823
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:32,182
[both sigh]

824
00:40:32,265 --> 00:40:34,100
Not who he says you are.

825
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:36,019
[stepfather] El, I need you out here.

826
00:40:36,102 --> 00:40:37,145
Coming.

827
00:40:38,938 --> 00:40:40,857
- You're crazy.
- Think about it.

828
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,192
It's never gonna happen.

829
00:40:42,275 --> 00:40:44,152
Hey, never say never.

830
00:40:44,235 --> 00:40:47,447
You should really consider
the craftsmanship and the material.

831
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:49,282
It's Italian leather.

832
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:50,575
- It's very nice.
- Mmm.

833
00:40:50,658 --> 00:40:54,245
[sighs] But I think it's a little outside
my price range.

834
00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:56,373
You're on your feet all day
at the restaurant.

835
00:40:56,456 --> 00:40:58,416
Don't your feet deserve a treat, hmm?

836
00:40:59,084 --> 00:41:01,878
- El! There you are.
- Mrs. Singh!

837
00:41:02,587 --> 00:41:03,797
Oh.

838
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,881
Mmm, how you doing?

839
00:41:04,964 --> 00:41:07,008
You know,
I've been meaning to drop these off.

840
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:09,928
- Okay, what you got for me?
- I wanna make sure you had these

841
00:41:10,011 --> 00:41:12,222
just in case
your allergies acted up this fall.

842
00:41:12,305 --> 00:41:13,616
- Thank you.
- Your mom always swore

843
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,825
- by my home remedies.
- That she did.

844
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:17,185
- So give them a try, <i>beta,</i> okay?
- Will do.

845
00:41:18,269 --> 00:41:20,247
- Love the window by the way.
- Look, I'll show you.

846
00:41:20,271 --> 00:41:22,023
Aw. You're so sweet.

847
00:41:22,107 --> 00:41:24,526
Aleko let me rescue the clock hands
from the trash so…

848
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:27,195
Aren't you clever? Rosie would love it.

849
00:41:27,278 --> 00:41:29,698
- You think?
- Think about what I said Mrs. Singh.

850
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:32,409
I'd be happy to throw in
a free pair of Odor-Eaters.

851
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:34,786
Did he just tell me my feet stink?

852
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:36,037
Quite possibly.

853
00:41:37,622 --> 00:41:38,623
Bye, Mrs. Singh.

854
00:41:38,707 --> 00:41:39,708
[Mrs. Singh] Bye!

855
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:42,002
I don't get this neighborhood.

856
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:44,004
They all pretend to be one big,
happy family.

857
00:41:44,087 --> 00:41:46,131
But when it comes down to it,
where are they?

858
00:41:46,214 --> 00:41:48,526
- I mean, they don't know you.
- [stepfather] And that's my fault?

859
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:51,177
Look, I've brought in all kinds
of styles and new items

860
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:53,096
so everyone will have something
to pick from.

861
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:54,806
I'm really trying.

862
00:41:54,889 --> 00:41:56,683
And obviously you don't know them either.

863
00:41:57,434 --> 00:41:58,560
Yeah, well,

864
00:41:58,643 --> 00:42:01,438
looks like the shop's going back
to the sneaker business anyway.

865
00:42:01,521 --> 00:42:04,482
What?
Hey, maybe I could curate something...

866
00:42:04,566 --> 00:42:07,110
I've spoken to Foot Locker
about buying this space.

867
00:42:10,697 --> 00:42:11,698
What are you...

868
00:42:15,243 --> 00:42:18,538
- You're selling the store?
- If I can get one of these execs to bite.

869
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:21,041
We're already a month behind
in the mortgage and...

870
00:42:21,124 --> 00:42:22,810
- The way things are looking, I...
- You... No.

871
00:42:22,834 --> 00:42:26,504
We can do a GoFundMe. All right?
A... A fundraiser...

872
00:42:26,588 --> 00:42:28,173
No, no, no, El!

873
00:42:28,256 --> 00:42:29,924
You always got your head in the clouds.

874
00:42:30,008 --> 00:42:31,736
Not everything works out
the way you want it to.

875
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,094
You think I don't know that?

876
00:42:34,888 --> 00:42:35,889
Huh?

877
00:42:41,978 --> 00:42:44,064
Mom wouldn't want you to sell.

878
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:49,319
- And if you ever loved her...
- Hey, hey! I did love her!

879
00:42:51,529 --> 00:42:54,741
You think this is something
I wanted to do alone? [Scoffs]

880
00:42:54,824 --> 00:42:58,244
Why do you think I've been so hard on you?
Trying to keep this store afloat.

881
00:42:59,662 --> 00:43:00,830
Enough is enough.

884
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:26,022
[Sami] Hello, I did it.
I got it all figured out.

885
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:27,774
Logan's brother's best friend, Jeremy,

886
00:43:27,857 --> 00:43:29,835
and his cousin are working in catering
at the gala.

887
00:43:29,859 --> 00:43:32,904
So as long as we get there
before the event starts

888
00:43:32,987 --> 00:43:34,781
he'll sneak us into the service entrance.

889
00:43:37,033 --> 00:43:38,243
Cool.

890
00:43:38,326 --> 00:43:41,204
You think it's too uncool to go
as waiters? I was totally thinking that.

891
00:43:41,287 --> 00:43:42,997
But it's fine.
We can costume change there.

892
00:43:44,499 --> 00:43:46,793
- He's selling Laces.
- [Sami] What?

893
00:43:49,504 --> 00:43:51,131
Trey's selling Laces.

894
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,969
He can't... He can't do that, can he?

895
00:43:56,886 --> 00:43:57,971
He just did.

896
00:44:01,516 --> 00:44:02,684
[sighs]

897
00:44:03,309 --> 00:44:05,854
The thing that my mom loves most is gone.

898
00:44:05,937 --> 00:44:07,355
- [Sami] Hey.
- [exhales]

899
00:44:08,356 --> 00:44:10,608
- It's gone.
- El, that is not true.

900
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:14,112
You're still here.

901
00:44:15,947 --> 00:44:19,159
And as long as you carry on her legacy,
she's not fully gone either.

902
00:44:19,242 --> 00:44:20,660
Sami, Sami! I...

903
00:44:22,203 --> 00:44:23,621
I don't know how to do that.

904
00:44:26,624 --> 00:44:27,876
Okay? This...

905
00:44:29,294 --> 00:44:32,422
This place is everything to her.

906
00:44:33,298 --> 00:44:34,591
- [Sami] It's...
- This place is…

907

[sighs]

908
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:41,097
- It's just a place, El.
- "Just a place"?

909
00:44:42,223 --> 00:44:43,863
- Come on. I didn't mean...
- [El] Just...

910
00:44:43,933 --> 00:44:47,729
I didn't mean it like that.
Listen, I love this place.

911
00:44:47,812 --> 00:44:52,067
I think I know about ten ways
to lace up my kicks because of this place.

912
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:55,820
Because of your mom.
Your super cool, funky mom.

913
00:44:57,072 --> 00:44:58,156
I miss her.

914
00:44:59,324 --> 00:45:00,575
Me too.

915
00:45:03,078 --> 00:45:04,079
A lot.

916
00:45:06,998 --> 00:45:10,585
And I think we both know
what she'd want you to do.

917
00:45:15,006 --> 00:45:16,007
Get up.

918
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:20,220

- Tickets.

1147
00:57:14,476 --> 00:57:15,477
Sami.

1148
00:57:22,067 --> 00:57:23,068
[gasps]

1149
00:57:23,151 --> 00:57:24,069
[laughs]

1150
00:57:24,152 --> 00:57:25,153
[beeps]

1151
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:28,073
Yeah, enjoy your evening.

1152
00:57:29,324 --> 00:57:31,201
- Thank you.
- We shall.

1153
00:57:37,624 --> 00:57:39,793
[house music playing]

1154
00:57:52,263 --> 00:57:54,683
This is a lot.

1155
00:57:55,433 --> 00:57:58,812
- Hello, good evening.
- Oh, word! They've got spoon appetizers!

1156
00:57:58,895 --> 00:58:01,106
Sir, I'm... Sami. I'm so sorry.

1157
00:58:01,189 --> 00:58:03,942
- She really likes that.
- That's good. That's really good.

1158
00:58:04,025 --> 00:58:05,610
Thanks. Mmm.

1159
00:58:06,194 --> 00:58:07,404
- [gulps]
- That is not classy.

1160
00:58:09,489 --> 00:58:11,574
- I'm good. Thank you.
- More for me.

1161
00:58:11,658 --> 00:58:14,327
I think I'm gonna take a lap.
See if I can find Kira.

1162
00:58:14,411 --> 00:58:17,580
Hey, don't forget. You're a rock star.
Let me get your picture.

1163
00:58:22,085 --> 00:58:23,294
- Okay.
- Don't eat everything.

1164
00:58:23,378 --> 00:58:25,046
Get lost. Mmm.

1165
00:58:27,424 --> 00:58:29,259
E-E-Excuse me?

1166
00:58:29,342 --> 00:58:30,468
Mm-hmm? What?

1167
00:58:30,969 --> 00:58:31,970
Who is that?

1168
00:58:34,305 --> 00:58:37,100
- We need those sneakers.
- We've never seen anything like them.

1169
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:39,060
That's 'cause they're one of ones.

1170
00:58:39,686 --> 00:58:40,895
- Really?
- [Sami] Mm-hmm.

1171
00:58:40,979 --> 00:58:43,940
I mean, you can try to convince him
to make you a pair,

1172
00:58:44,024 --> 00:58:46,443
but I've been waiting for years.

1173
00:58:46,526 --> 00:58:48,278
- He's the designer?
- Yep.

1174
00:58:48,361 --> 00:58:49,612
[attendee] Well,

1175
00:58:50,697 --> 00:58:52,032
who's he with?

1176
00:58:53,033 --> 00:58:54,451
Um, he's with me.

1177
00:58:54,534 --> 00:58:57,370
No. She means who's he with? The company.

1178
00:58:59,789 --> 00:59:01,124
Um…

1179
00:59:01,207 --> 00:59:03,877
I'm not at liberty to say.

1180
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:05,545
[groans] Did you sign an NDA?

1181
00:59:06,129 --> 00:59:08,214
Mmm. I can't even tell you that.

1182
00:59:08,298 --> 00:59:11,426
- [sighs] Come on. She's messing with us.
- You sure about that?

1183
00:59:17,474 --> 00:59:20,894
- I am going to find out who he's with.
- Yeah?

1184
00:59:20,977 --> 00:59:23,229
- Good luck. I'm gonna beat you to it.
- All right.

1185
00:59:26,566 --> 00:59:28,276
- Have you seen...
- [attendee 1 murmurs]

1186
00:59:30,653 --> 00:59:32,572
[attendee 2] My team is all over this.

1187
00:59:32,655 --> 00:59:33,865
[attendee 3] Oh, my God.

1188
00:59:33,948 --> 00:59:36,034
Okay, so it's not King.
Is it King or is it not King?

1189
00:59:36,117 --> 00:59:39,037
I need to know.
Those shoes are out of this world.

1190
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:46,753
Apparently three brands are chasing him,
and he hasn't committed yet.

1191
00:59:46,836 --> 00:59:49,964
[attendee 4] I'm telling you.
He's got some top-secret collab brewing.

1192
00:59:50,048 --> 00:59:53,426
[attendee 5] Oh, my God. Did you see
what I saw? I mean, it's amazing.

1193
00:59:53,927 --> 00:59:56,614
[attendee 6] You know it's gonna
be all over the next issue of <i>Complex.</i>

1194
00:59:56,638 --> 00:59:58,264
[attendee 7] Does anybody know his name?

1195
00:59:58,848 --> 01:00:00,993
- [attendee 8] Do you know anything…
- [indistinct whispering]

1196
01:00:01,017 --> 01:00:03,978
[attendee 9] Have you seen this designer
that everyone's talking about?

1197
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:06,731
[attendee 10] Yeah, he does.

1198
01:00:06,815 --> 01:00:08,167
[attendee 11] These are incredible.

1199
01:00:08,191 --> 01:00:10,819
[attendee 12]
He has designed for everyone.

1200
01:00:10,902 --> 01:00:14,239
[whispering continues]

1201
01:00:14,322 --> 01:00:15,602
- [whispering stops]
- Oh, sorry.

1202
01:00:17,659 --> 01:00:18,785
Oh, my gosh.

It's you.

1221
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:07,435
El, I was worried I'd never see you again.

1222
01:02:09,229 --> 01:02:10,689
Wait, why are you here?

1223
01:02:10,772 --> 01:02:13,191
Well, I was, um, hoping to see you.

1224
01:02:14,943 --> 01:02:16,236
- Uh…
- Wait.

1225
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,530
This time I want to show you something.

1226
01:02:19,864 --> 01:02:20,949
Come on.

1227
01:02:24,661 --> 01:02:26,788
- Sorry.
- [El] Pardon me.

1228
01:02:26,871 --> 01:02:28,540
[security] It's all yours, Miss King.

1229
01:02:28,623 --> 01:02:30,063
- [Kira] Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1230
01:02:33,211 --> 01:02:34,212
[El] Where you taking me?

1231
01:02:37,132 --> 01:02:38,591
Whoa.

1232
01:02:39,217 --> 01:02:40,218
Voilà.

1233
01:02:40,301 --> 01:02:43,054
Whoa. Whoa!

1234
01:02:43,138 --> 01:02:44,139
Yo!

1235
01:02:45,015 --> 01:02:47,183
Oh, my God. This is sneaker heaven. Oh!

[cheering]

1237
01:02:48,852 --> 01:02:51,021
- El!
- Oh, my God.

1238
01:02:51,104 --> 01:02:53,440
Oh, my God. You got the tie-dyes.

1239
01:02:53,523 --> 01:02:56,568
- Got the tie-dyes.
- Oh, my... Jordans? Did Jordan sign this?

1240
01:02:56,651 --> 01:02:59,571
- Oh, God! This is amazing.
- Oh, my God.

1241
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,490
[El] This is the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1242
01:03:06,077 --> 01:03:07,203
Thank you.

1243
01:03:09,789 --> 01:03:13,376
Ooh, I got chills. This is my dream.

1244
01:03:15,211 --> 01:03:16,254
My mom would love this.

1245
01:03:18,089 --> 01:03:20,425
So, which ones are your favorite to wear?

1246
01:03:21,134 --> 01:03:22,802
Are you kidding?

1247
01:03:22,886 --> 01:03:25,513
I'm not allowed to touch them,
I mean, never mind wear them.

1248
01:03:25,597 --> 01:03:27,724
What? Not even once?

1249
01:03:28,266 --> 01:03:30,518
Whoa. No... No way.

1250
01:03:31,853 --> 01:03:33,813
[laughing]

1251
01:03:33,897 --> 01:03:36,191
Yo. Yo. You haven't touched these?

1252
01:03:36,816 --> 01:03:39,736
Your dad's OG Blues from the finals
when he hit that buzzer-beater

1253
01:03:39,819 --> 01:03:41,613
against the Celtics? I don't believe it.

1254
01:03:41,696 --> 01:03:47,118
Okay, one time when I was a little kid
and I wore them out to the elevator,

1255
01:03:47,202 --> 01:03:49,829
but then I chickened out
and put them back.

1256
01:03:51,122 --> 01:03:54,793
You know, um,
I think these might not be your size.

1257
01:03:54,876 --> 01:03:57,420
You know, you didn't really inherit
the height of your father.

1258
01:03:57,504 --> 01:03:59,089
They were a little bit too big, huh?

1259
01:04:00,548 --> 01:04:02,425
Aight. Enough about my family. Tell me.

1260
01:04:03,468 --> 01:04:05,095
What kicks you rocking tonight?

1261
01:04:05,178 --> 01:04:06,179
Um…

1262
01:04:09,933 --> 01:04:11,351
You know, it's just a little…

1263
01:04:12,394 --> 01:04:13,394
Oh, my God.

1264
01:04:15,814 --> 01:04:17,440
Did you design these?

1265
01:04:20,819 --> 01:04:24,656
Wow. That colorway.
Wait, is that the graffiti wall?

1266
01:04:24,739 --> 01:04:25,740
Yeah.

1267
01:04:26,408 --> 01:04:30,370
Look at the soles.
El, I can see our whole day in them.

1268
01:04:32,622 --> 01:04:33,957
Wait a second.

1269
01:04:35,041 --> 01:04:38,753
- You're him! You're the guy.
- The guy?

1270
01:04:38,837 --> 01:04:39,921
Yeah, yeah, the guy.

1271
01:04:40,005 --> 01:04:43,591
- The guy with the secret celebrity collab.
- What?

1272
01:04:43,675 --> 01:04:46,302
The guy that everybody's
been talking about tonight.

1273
01:04:46,386 --> 01:04:48,179
My sister, Liv,
was going on and on about it.

1274
01:04:48,263 --> 01:04:50,408
Why didn't you tell me
the other day that you were a designer?

1275
01:04:50,432 --> 01:04:52,767
- And a phenomenal one at that.
- Manhattan.

1276
01:04:53,893 --> 01:04:56,396
You didn't tell me you were Kira King.
Huh?

1277
01:04:56,479 --> 01:04:59,941
Kira King. Like, that's something
that's kind of important to know.

1278
01:05:00,025 --> 01:05:01,317
Sneaker royalty?

1279
01:05:01,401 --> 01:05:02,819
- Royalty?
- [El] Yeah.

1280
01:05:02,902 --> 01:05:05,864
Okay. That's fair.

1281
01:05:08,783 --> 01:05:10,994
I'm Kira King.

1282
01:05:11,077 --> 01:05:12,328
I know.

1283
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:15,248
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

1284
01:05:16,541 --> 01:05:19,961
And listen, you have to come with me.
This is destiny.

1285
01:05:20,045 --> 01:05:23,214
'Cause tonight's literally my last chance
to prove to my dad that

1286
01:05:23,298 --> 01:05:26,718
there's a designer out there
who's actually saying something,

1287
01:05:27,302 --> 01:05:28,595
who's got a point of view.

1288
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:30,388
And, El…

1289
01:05:32,432 --> 01:05:33,433
You're him.

1290
01:05:33,516 --> 01:05:34,601
W-Wait.

1291
01:05:34,684 --> 01:05:36,853
You're saying I should
design for the King brand?

1292
01:05:36,936 --> 01:05:37,771
Yeah.

1293
01:05:37,854 --> 01:05:39,230
- [applause]
- King brand?

1294
01:05:39,314 --> 01:05:40,523
- Like...
- Oh.

1295
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:42,067
Oh, that's him.

1296
01:05:42,150 --> 01:05:44,110
- Who?
- Come on. My dad.

1297
01:05:44,194 --> 01:05:46,339
- [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen…
- Come on. Now's our chance.

1298
01:05:46,363 --> 01:05:47,882
- …basketball legend…
- [El] Right now?

1299
01:05:47,906 --> 01:05:52,077
…and your host for this evening's King6
Annual Charity Gala, Darius King.

1300
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:55,455
[Darius] My wife, Denise, and I
would like to thank you all for coming.

1301
01:05:55,538 --> 01:05:57,791
As a kid growing up
in the streets of Queens,

1302
01:05:57,874 --> 01:05:59,209
I didn't always have the money

1303
01:05:59,292 --> 01:06:02,170
- to buy the freshest pair…
- Okay. Oh, God. I'm so excited.

1304
01:06:02,253 --> 01:06:04,422
Once he's done with his intro,
I'll grab him.

1305
01:06:04,506 --> 01:06:05,866
[Darius] Who believed in my dream?

1306
01:06:05,924 --> 01:06:08,885
Yo, this is crazy. I mean, he's gonna
lose it when he sees your work.

1307
01:06:08,968 --> 01:06:10,136
Y-Y-You think so?

1308
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:11,340
[Darius] …to the next level.

1309
01:06:11,388 --> 01:06:12,681
And King6 was born.

1310
01:06:12,764 --> 01:06:15,975
Under the direction
of my eldest daughter, Liv,

1311
01:06:16,059 --> 01:06:19,688
we will be dropping something
unlike anything you've seen before.

1312
01:06:19,771 --> 01:06:20,772
[applause]

1313
01:06:20,855 --> 01:06:23,692
Working with great talent,
people we believe in.

1314
01:06:23,775 --> 01:06:24,984
As I talk about Liv…

1315
01:06:25,068 --> 01:06:27,445
- Anyway, uh, he will.
- [Darius] …I'm reminded…

1316
01:06:27,529 --> 01:06:30,031
Listen, you know,
it's kind of silly, but my dad,

1317
01:06:30,115 --> 01:06:33,702
he says that experience really matters,

1318
01:06:33,785 --> 01:06:35,745
so he's gonna want
to know everything about you.

1319
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:37,914
Like where you're from
or what else you've done

1320
01:06:37,997 --> 01:06:39,874
- or who you've worked with.
- Oh.

1321
01:06:39,958 --> 01:06:40,959
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1322
01:06:41,042 --> 01:06:44,337
You're young, but the way you've blown up,
you've obviously had, like…

1323
01:06:44,421 --> 01:06:46,273
- Well... I...
- …tons of professional gigs, right?

1324
01:06:46,297 --> 01:06:48,299
I got a lot riding on this.

1325
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:55,015
I'm your guy.

1326
01:06:58,935 --> 01:07:00,812
I'm never going to forget tonight.

1327
01:07:00,895 --> 01:07:03,565
- S-Same.
- [clears throat] Where have you been?

1328
01:07:04,232 --> 01:07:05,483
Oh, good. You found her.

1329
01:07:05,567 --> 01:07:07,152
- Hey, Sami.
- Hi.

1330
01:07:07,235 --> 01:07:11,281
- [Liv] You know these people?
- This is the guy.

1331
01:07:11,364 --> 01:07:12,532
You're the guy?

1332
01:07:13,116 --> 01:07:15,160
Uh, I did design these,
but I'm not really...

1333
01:07:15,243 --> 01:07:17,537
Of course, he's the guy.
I mean, look at the shoes.

1334
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:20,123
Can I take a picture of you?
You look so beautiful.

1335
01:07:20,206 --> 01:07:21,416
Now, you get in there.

1336
01:07:21,499 --> 01:07:23,793
- Oh, stop being so modest.
- [Kira] Yeah.

1337
01:07:23,877 --> 01:07:27,047
He's such a superstar. [Squeals]
Look at that power couple.

1338
01:07:27,881 --> 01:07:29,966
[squeals]
That's so cute. I'm gonna frame it.

1339
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:30,967
[all laugh]

1340
01:07:31,051 --> 01:07:33,136
I'm so excited.
I really want Dad to meet him.

1341
01:07:33,219 --> 01:07:35,347
Isn't this exactly who he told me to find?

1342
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:36,431
[Liv] Take a deep breath.

1343
01:07:36,514 --> 01:07:39,059
You'll get a chance to introduce him
to Dad when he's done.

1344
01:07:39,142 --> 01:07:41,037
[Darius] This program promotes honesty
and integrity,

1345
01:07:41,061 --> 01:07:42,520
which are very important…

1346
01:07:42,604 --> 01:07:43,855
I wish he'd hurry up.

1347
01:07:43,938 --> 01:07:46,733
It is almost midnight, so you know
he always does the auction then.

1348
01:07:46,816 --> 01:07:48,651
- Midnight?
- Oh, yeah.

1349
01:07:48,735 --> 01:07:49,903
Midnight.

1350
01:07:49,986 --> 01:07:51,112
[bell tolls]

1351
01:07:51,196 --> 01:07:53,823
[gasps] Oh, no, we can't go.
You're about to meet King.

1352
01:07:53,907 --> 01:07:56,659
That's exactly the problem.
I... I screwed up.

1353
01:07:56,743 --> 01:07:58,870
Okay, okay. G did warn us about midnight.

1354
01:07:58,953 --> 01:08:00,914
I'm... I'm sorry. What is going on...

1355
01:08:00,997 --> 01:08:03,208
[announcer] Give it up for Darius King.

1356
01:08:03,291 --> 01:08:06,461
He'll be stepping down
so we can start the auction at midnight.

1357
01:08:06,544 --> 01:08:07,544
[El] I'm so sorry.

1358
01:08:07,587 --> 01:08:09,923
I really gotta get the guy
out of here right now.

1359
01:08:10,006 --> 01:08:11,216
It's... It's a... Uh...

1360
01:08:11,299 --> 01:08:12,592
- Wait. What?
- A curfew thing.

1361
01:08:12,676 --> 01:08:13,736
- Follow me.
- [El] Excuse me.

1362
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,279
- What is up with your friends?
- I don't know.

1363
01:08:15,303 --> 01:08:17,055
- Excuse me.
- [Liv] You can't leave yet.

1364
01:08:17,138 --> 01:08:18,949
- [Sami] Gotta go. Sorry.
- I'll be right back.

1365
01:08:18,973 --> 01:08:20,225
- [El] Come on.
- [Kira] El!

1366
01:08:20,308 --> 01:08:21,601
- Sorry.
- [El] Hey, hey!

1367
01:08:21,685 --> 01:08:22,685
[tolling continues]

1368
01:08:22,727 --> 01:08:23,853
[El] No.

1369
01:08:23,937 --> 01:08:24,938
[shouts] My suit!

1370
01:08:25,897 --> 01:08:27,190
[grunts, screams]

1371
01:08:27,273 --> 01:08:29,067
What is happening?

1372
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:32,278
[Sami] El, I'm covered in appetizers. Run!

1373
01:08:32,362 --> 01:08:33,363
Excuse me.

1374
01:08:33,947 --> 01:08:36,783
- Oh, shoot. I don't know.
- Wait, what are you doing? That's the up.

1375
01:08:37,909 --> 01:08:40,620
[screams, grunts]

1376
01:08:40,704 --> 01:08:42,205
I'm stuck!

1377
01:08:42,706 --> 01:08:43,873
[shouts]

1378
01:08:43,957 --> 01:08:45,250
[Sami] Jump!

1379
01:08:46,084 --> 01:08:47,335
[grunts]

1380
01:08:47,961 --> 01:08:48,962
[Kira] El!

1381
01:08:50,005 --> 01:08:51,923
[gasps] My shoe! My shoe! No!

1382
01:08:52,007 --> 01:08:53,466
[tolling continues]

1383
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:54,718
Don't let him leave.

1384
01:08:55,218 --> 01:08:56,219
[gasps]

1385
01:08:57,762 --> 01:08:58,763
[Sami] Leave it.

1386
01:09:00,932 --> 01:09:02,100
El.

1387
01:09:02,183 --> 01:09:03,893
- I'm sorry.
- We gotta go.

1388
01:09:03,977 --> 01:09:05,854
[Kira] How do I find you again?

1389
01:09:06,771 --> 01:09:08,773
[bell tolling, clock ticking]

1390
01:09:08,857 --> 01:09:10,358
- Go, go, go!
- Watch out, people!

1391
01:09:16,197 --> 01:09:17,323
[Sami screams]

1392
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:22,871
- [gasps]
- [El] Wait!

1393
01:09:23,538 --> 01:09:25,707
- No!
- Wait, wait, wait.

1394
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:26,916
[Sami] We're here!

1395
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,602
- No, wait.
- We're here. We're... [gasps]

1396
01:09:28,626 --> 01:09:33,089
[bells toll]

1397
01:09:33,173 --> 01:09:35,425
[both gasp]

1398
01:09:35,508 --> 01:09:36,676
Ooh.

1399
01:09:42,974 --> 01:09:45,518
[panting]

1400
01:10:18,259 --> 01:10:20,261
- [El] Hey, Sami.
- [Sami] Yeah?

1401
01:10:20,345 --> 01:10:23,682
[El] Why did everyone at that party think
I was this hot underground designer?

1402
01:10:23,765 --> 01:10:25,517
One that's blowing up worldwide.

1403
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:31,815
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

1404
01:10:31,898 --> 01:10:34,526
- What did you tell them?
- Nothing m-much.

1405
01:10:35,276 --> 01:10:37,529
- Just that you're a designer…
- Mm-hmm.

1406
01:10:37,612 --> 01:10:39,948
…and you're really cool. And that's...

1407
01:10:40,907 --> 01:10:42,575
That's about it.

1408
01:10:44,244 --> 01:10:45,328
Samantha.

1409
01:10:46,246 --> 01:10:49,499
- Okay, I may have hyped you up a little…
- Why?

1410
01:10:49,582 --> 01:10:51,710
…but I barely said anything.

1411
01:10:51,793 --> 01:10:54,754
I can't help what conclusions
other people might have jumped to.

1412
01:10:54,838 --> 01:10:57,841
Okay, well, Kira asked me
if I have professional experience.

1413
01:10:59,217 --> 01:11:00,468
- And?
- And...

1414
01:11:00,552 --> 01:11:04,723
She wanted me to meet Mr. King.
So I said... I said I did.

1415
01:11:04,806 --> 01:11:07,350
- Dude, that's amazing!
- No, that's not good.

1416
01:11:07,434 --> 01:11:09,310
That's horrible. I lied. I lied to her.

1417
01:11:09,394 --> 01:11:12,856
Okay, do you think anyone at that party
was a 100% real?

1418
01:11:12,939 --> 01:11:14,399
- Yes.
- No.

1419
01:11:14,482 --> 01:11:19,279
Look, we both exaggerated a teeny
amount, and it's gonna turn out great.

1420
01:11:19,904 --> 01:11:21,197
- [sighs]
- Probably.

1421
01:11:21,281 --> 01:11:23,742
[El] Sami, how can I face her again
after this?

1422
01:11:24,325 --> 01:11:26,494
So tell me again why he ran away.

1423
01:11:26,578 --> 01:11:29,456
- He's an artist. They're all… You know.
- [Darius] Mmm.

1424
01:11:29,539 --> 01:11:31,791
I mean, Banksy doesn't ever show his face.

1425
01:11:31,875 --> 01:11:34,252
And you're a really big deal, Dad.

1426
01:11:34,336 --> 01:11:36,755
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I mean, people get nervous.

1427
01:11:36,838 --> 01:11:38,923
- Yeah, nice try.
- Okay, but Dad.

1428
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:42,344
Come on, look. Look at the work.
I mean, it speaks for itself, right?

1429
01:11:43,261 --> 01:11:44,596
I admit it does draw me in.

1430
01:11:44,679 --> 01:11:49,851
It's like looking at something
entirely new, but so familiar.

1431
01:11:49,934 --> 01:11:53,605
It reminds me of home. I don't know why.
It's very colorful.

1432
01:11:53,688 --> 01:11:55,148
Yo, I know that spot.

1433
01:11:55,231 --> 01:11:58,193
Your mom took me here
when we first started dating.

1434
01:11:58,276 --> 01:12:00,612
- Really?
- Yeah, they had, like, the best dessert.

1435
01:12:00,695 --> 01:12:02,715
- It was like this custardy thing...
- Galaktoboureko?

1436
01:12:02,739 --> 01:12:04,491
Yeah. Hey, how you know that?

1437
01:12:04,574 --> 01:12:05,825
He took me there.

1438
01:12:07,327 --> 01:12:10,205
I still don't like that I don't know
anything about his background.

1439
01:12:10,288 --> 01:12:11,289
[sighs]

1440
01:12:11,373 --> 01:12:14,959
He's worked with plenty top-tier brands.
Look how personal his work is.

1441
01:12:15,043 --> 01:12:16,044
I trust him.

1442
01:12:16,878 --> 01:12:19,089
I just really need you to trust me.

1443
01:12:19,673 --> 01:12:20,674
[sighs] Liv?

1444
01:12:20,757 --> 01:12:26,054
I admit it's good work, but the unknown
factor just makes it very risky.

1445
01:12:27,847 --> 01:12:30,642
Okay, Kira. You bring him in.

1446
01:12:31,476 --> 01:12:35,939
We'll sit him down,
and if everything you say checks out,

1447
01:12:36,022 --> 01:12:38,441
then we'll try to showcase it
at Sneakercon.

1448
01:12:38,525 --> 01:12:40,151
- Really?
- Yes.

1449
01:12:41,111 --> 01:12:42,362
- Thanks, Dad.
- You got it.

1450
01:12:42,445 --> 01:12:43,655
- Love you, Dad!
- Peace!

1451
01:12:45,699 --> 01:12:47,492
[Kira] Yes! Yes, yes, yes. [Laughs]

1452
01:12:48,284 --> 01:12:52,914
[singing]

1453
01:12:52,997 --> 01:12:54,350
[fan 1] Yo, King, can I take a selfie?

1454
01:12:54,374 --> 01:12:55,810
- [fan 2] Darius!
- [fan 3] Over here.

1455
01:12:55,834 --> 01:12:58,020
- What happened last night?
- [fan 4] I just met the King.

1456
01:12:58,044 --> 01:12:59,671
[fan 5] Yo, King I wanna score too.

1457
01:13:31,411 --> 01:13:35,498
I just want you to understand
how much is on the line for us right now.

1458
01:13:35,582 --> 01:13:36,666
Which is why…

1459
01:13:39,002 --> 01:13:41,212
I'm gonna help you with anything you need.

1460
01:13:42,797 --> 01:13:44,049
Okay?

1461
01:13:45,175 --> 01:13:46,343
You will?

1462
01:13:46,426 --> 01:13:49,554
If this is what we're doing,
then let's really do it.

1463
01:13:49,637 --> 01:13:51,723
Let's make it happen. I'm all in, okay?

1464
01:13:51,806 --> 01:13:53,558
- Thank you.
- Of course.

1465
01:13:53,641 --> 01:13:55,643
All right, now we just gotta find him.

1466
01:13:55,727 --> 01:13:57,687
Yes! Call him. Text him right now.

1467
01:13:57,771 --> 01:14:01,232
Yeah, I can't.
I don't have his number or Instagram or...

1468
01:14:01,316 --> 01:14:03,109
- So you've hung out twice…
- I know.

1469
01:14:03,193 --> 01:14:05,695
- …and you didn't get any digits?
- Yeah.

1470
01:14:05,779 --> 01:14:07,822
Girl, what's going on?
Your game needs work.

1471
01:14:07,906 --> 01:14:09,282
- I need help.
- Yes, you do.

1472
01:14:09,366 --> 01:14:10,575
I only have his first name.

1473
01:14:10,658 --> 01:14:13,203
And I don't know how to find him,
but I do have his shoe.

1474
01:14:13,912 --> 01:14:17,248
You talk about connecting with people
when we were at dinner, right?

1475

1786
01:29:47,512 --> 01:29:49,889
Come here. Stay in touch.

1787
01:29:49,973 --> 01:29:51,057

[Gustavo] <i>What would become of his dreams?</i>

1790
01:30:45,487 --> 01:30:49,908
<i>Would he never see his passion and
talent fulfilled because of one mistake?</i>

1791
01:30:49,991 --> 01:30:53,703
<i>Or would the neighborhood he loved
and whose spirit he represented</i>

1792
01:30:53,787 --> 01:30:56,456
<i>come together to give him one more chance?</i>

1793
01:30:57,374 --> 01:31:01,961
<i>Well, that would be
its own kind of magic, wouldn't it?</i>

1794
01:31:06,383 --> 01:31:09,219
[Denise] Kira. Kira.

1795
01:31:10,637 --> 01:31:13,723
- Hey, today's the big day.
- [Kira] Yeah.

1796
01:31:13,807 --> 01:31:16,101
- [Denise] It's game day.
- For Liv.

1797
01:31:16,184 --> 01:31:18,770
[scoffs] No, for all of us.

1798
01:31:18,853 --> 01:31:22,315
You're a big part of this company too,
Kira, and this family.

1799
01:31:23,858 --> 01:31:26,027
- We're all Kings.
- I don't feel like one.

1800
01:31:26,111 --> 01:31:27,838
[Denise]
Well, you gotta straighten your crown.

1801
01:31:27,862 --> 01:31:30,091
You know, I've been really proud of you
these past few weeks.

1802
01:31:30,115 --> 01:31:31,115
Why?

1803
01:31:32,075 --> 01:31:33,368
Mom, I screwed up big time.

1804
01:31:33,451 --> 01:31:35,245
- It was all a lie.
- All?

1805
01:31:35,328 --> 01:31:37,956
Everything El said about his experience.

1806
01:31:38,039 --> 01:31:39,624
He got in over his head.

1807
01:31:41,126 --> 01:31:42,711
Then again, so did you.

1808
01:31:42,794 --> 01:31:46,089
How is it my fault that he lied?
I don't understand.

1809
01:31:46,172 --> 01:31:49,050
Oh, I suppose it's impossible
that you wanted this so badly,

1810
01:31:49,134 --> 01:31:51,553
you might have led him into saying
what you needed to hear?

1811
01:31:51,636 --> 01:31:53,054
- Maybe.
- [Denise] Maybe.

1812
01:31:54,472 --> 01:31:56,558
Come here. Listen to me.

1813
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:01,271
It is not easy as a young woman
to stand up and have your voice heard

1814
01:32:01,354 --> 01:32:04,691
above everybody else's,
and especially your father's.

1815
01:32:04,774 --> 01:32:06,359
- Yeah.
- Okay?

1816
01:32:06,443 --> 01:32:08,236
- [Kira] Yeah.
- Got a big mouth.

1817
01:32:08,319 --> 01:32:09,738
Yeah.

1818
01:32:11,823 --> 01:32:12,824
But you did.

1819
01:32:12,907 --> 01:32:14,659
And I'm very proud of you for that

1820
01:32:14,743 --> 01:32:18,455
because that means that you're starting
to find your own voice and trust yourself.

1821
01:32:20,707 --> 01:32:23,710
- That means you're growing up.
- Yeah.

1822
01:32:23,793 --> 01:32:26,755
And you know what? Okay,
so you messed up. We all do.

1823
01:32:26,838 --> 01:32:28,673
The most important thing is that you

1824
01:32:28,757 --> 01:32:30,901
figure out what it is that
you can do differently next time.

1825
01:32:30,925 --> 01:32:34,095
- Yeah, I guess you're right, Mom.
- Oh, of course I am.

1826
01:32:34,179 --> 01:32:37,432
Baby, you know how many of these talks
I've given over the years to Liv?

1827
01:32:37,515 --> 01:32:39,559
- Wait, really?
- Uh-huh. And to your dad.

1828
01:32:39,642 --> 01:32:41,227
- Mm-hmm, absolutely.
- What?

1829
01:32:41,311 --> 01:32:45,774
Baby, he did not become the King
on his own, my love, okay?

1830
01:32:46,441 --> 01:32:47,984
- My baby.
- What's so funny?

1831
01:32:48,068 --> 01:32:50,236
- Oh, baby. Aw.
- What?

1832
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:52,364
- You look great.
- Stop. Okay.

1833
01:32:52,447 --> 01:32:54,157
Get up. We gotta go.

1834
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:56,034

- All right. Get up.

1835

All right.

1836
01:32:57,202 --> 01:32:59,388
- Let me get that hair, baby.
- [Liv] Were y'all talking about me?

1837
01:32:59,412 --> 01:33:01,247
- No.
- No, no, no.
