1
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,434
Okay, okay, I'm coming, god dammit!

2
00:02:17,641 --> 00:02:18,630
Sonny?

3
00:02:19,843 --> 00:02:21,812
Hey, Mama. Open the door.

4
00:02:32,992 --> 00:02:34,459
My baby, Sonny!

5
00:02:38,131 --> 00:02:40,326
Why didn't you let me know
you was coming?

6
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,564
My papers got processed yesterday.
I caught the first bus I could.

7
00:02:43,638 --> 00:02:45,367
Let me look at you.

8
00:02:45,607 --> 00:02:49,008
-Mama, I got your favorite.
-Why, you haven't changed a bit.

9
00:02:49,612 --> 00:02:51,375
Let's get out of the sun, okay?

10
00:02:51,447 --> 00:02:54,348
Carol, come here right now
and meet my boy.

11
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:57,818
I want you to meet my new girl.
You're gonna love her to death.

12
00:03:02,926 --> 00:03:04,895
Here, sit yourself down.

13
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:11,527
I'm so glad you came home.

14
00:03:11,603 --> 00:03:14,731
You've no idea how crazy
things have been here without you.

15
00:03:14,806 --> 00:03:17,435
Old Henry. He don't make
as much money as he used to.

16
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,569
Not that he ever made much anyway.

17
00:03:20,246 --> 00:03:23,181
And naturally,
your poor mama can't work no more.

18
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,844
But Carol, she does pretty good.

19
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:29,916
Carol, I said get your ass in here right now
and meet my boy!

20
00:03:30,624 --> 00:03:32,889
Like I said, she does pretty good now.

21
00:03:32,994 --> 00:03:35,963
But with you to teach her,
she'll make a fine deal of money.

22
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,499
Mom, please. Just slow down, okay?

23
00:03:39,935 --> 00:03:40,902
Slow down.

24
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:44,302
Her last old man beat her half to death,
left her in the hospital.

25
00:03:44,373 --> 00:03:46,137
I paid the bill, brought her home.

26
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:48,973
I knew when I saw her
that she was gonna make a good one.

27
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:51,071
I said to myself, "Yes, sir...

28
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:54,482
"she'll make a fine little partner for Sonny
when he gets home.

29
00:03:54,585 --> 00:03:57,452
"These two are gonna make
a lot of money together."

30
00:03:57,588 --> 00:04:00,752
Carol, God damn it! What're you doing
sneaking up on me like that?

31
00:04:00,826 --> 00:04:02,953
Get over here and meet my boy.

32
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,332
Carol Lees, my boy Sonny,
the best there ever was.

33
00:04:08,735 --> 00:04:10,862
I know because I trained him myself.

34
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,038
Glad to meet you.
Heard a great deal about you.

35
00:04:16,377 --> 00:04:18,777
Mama talks a lot more than she should.

36
00:04:21,883 --> 00:04:24,545
Come into the kitchen.
I'll fix you something to eat.

37
00:04:24,619 --> 00:04:27,851
Now you go get ready.
You've got a 10:30 date with Troy.

38
00:04:27,924 --> 00:04:30,620
And don't let him have
no more half-and-half for $100.

39
00:04:30,693 --> 00:04:34,391
He either pays $200 or he gets it straight.
Same as everybody else.

40
00:04:34,698 --> 00:04:36,325
Damn stupid girl.

41
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:40,296
She'd give it away
if I didn't stay on top of her all the time.

42
00:04:43,842 --> 00:04:45,571
How do you like Carol?

43
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,481
-She's a nice girl.
-She's a moneymaker, too.

44
00:04:50,783 --> 00:04:54,549
You teach her a few things,
she's gonna be the best around here.

45
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,987
I'll get your nice, white suit
cleaned and pressed.

46
00:04:57,057 --> 00:04:59,457
You'll be right back where you was
before you left.

47
00:04:59,526 --> 00:05:02,325
I'm not gonna do that kind of work anymore.

48
00:05:03,931 --> 00:05:05,592
What you talking about?

49
00:05:06,934 --> 00:05:08,731
There's this guy I know.

50
00:05:08,803 --> 00:05:11,898
His father owns a bookstore in Texas City...

51
00:05:12,307 --> 00:05:14,707
and I was thinking about
going there for a job.

52
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:19,077
You only just got home. You're thinking
about leaving again already?

53
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,906
I'll send you money.

54
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:23,752
Selling books? You?

55
00:05:23,821 --> 00:05:27,450
What the hell you know about books?
You ain't never read nothing.

56
00:05:28,192 --> 00:05:29,922
Mama, those days are over.

57
00:05:30,796 --> 00:05:32,923
-I'm too old for that now.
-Old?

58
00:05:33,465 --> 00:05:36,025
You're better-looking than you ever was.

59
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:39,737
You ain't aged a day
since you've been away.

60
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:43,538
I gave you the best training there was
since you was a boy.

61
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:47,307
You want to throw all that away
when you're in the prime of your life?

62
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:48,848
I won't hear of it.

63
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:50,944
I'm 26 years old.

64
00:05:51,386 --> 00:05:55,322
I don't want to screw all night anymore.
I don't have the stomach for it.

65
00:06:00,162 --> 00:06:03,962
I gave up my best years
so you could have everything you needed.

66
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,859
You listen to your mama.
You could work for your dates.

67
00:06:08,605 --> 00:06:10,732
People still talk about you.

68
00:06:11,107 --> 00:06:15,169
You can make three times the money
you used to, for the same amount of time.

69
00:06:15,313 --> 00:06:19,580
And if you work doubles with Carol,
you're gonna make $5,000 a week, easy.

70
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:24,516
Mama, I'm going down
to get that job in Texas City, all right?

71
00:06:24,623 --> 00:06:27,115
So just get used to the idea.

72
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,622
I'm sorry, Mama. It's just....

73
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:36,161
I learned there's more to life
than hustling tricks.

74
00:06:36,237 --> 00:06:38,728
I wanna find something to do
so I don't end up....

75
00:06:39,406 --> 00:06:40,601
End up like what?

76
00:06:40,675 --> 00:06:44,338
So you don't have to end up like me?
Is that what you're trying to say?

77
00:06:44,846 --> 00:06:46,177
I'm sorry, Mama.

78
00:06:47,717 --> 00:06:50,242
You ungrateful son of a bitch!

79
00:06:50,987 --> 00:06:53,547
Go ahead! You go try be a square.

80
00:06:53,757 --> 00:06:55,622
But they don't want you either.

81
00:06:55,726 --> 00:06:59,127
You think you're the first one
who's ever tried to quit?

82
00:08:46,085 --> 00:08:47,484
Oh, man.

83
00:08:59,066 --> 00:09:01,228
Finish it, damn you. Finish it!

84
00:09:02,137 --> 00:09:04,037
I want the Pontiac, Troy.

85
00:09:04,305 --> 00:09:07,139
That's a $5,000 automobile, darling.

86
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:10,110
I want it for a month
till Sonny can buy one for himself.

87
00:09:12,081 --> 00:09:15,779
Just finish it.
And then, we'll talk about it, all right?

88
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:19,555
You're not listening.
I said I want the Pontiac, Troy.

89
00:09:19,723 --> 00:09:22,420
All right. Just finish it.

90
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:44,116
One of my tricks decided to let you
use his car until you get on your feet.

91
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:46,142
There's $100, too.

92
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:48,922
You need some clothes.

93
00:09:52,594 --> 00:09:56,827
I know this used to be your room,
so I'll move out if you don't want me here.

94
00:09:59,502 --> 00:10:00,935
No, you can stay.

95
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:20,217
You still need some money
until you can earn some.

96
00:10:20,726 --> 00:10:22,091
You want any help?

97
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,191
Do I have to fuck for it?

98
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:27,765
Yeah.

99
00:10:31,105 --> 00:10:35,474
There's $100 and a new car outside.
I don't think I got it all paid for yet.

100
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:04,306
It's funny. I've never paid for it before.

101
00:11:05,178 --> 00:11:06,907
It's crazy like this.

102
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:17,118
Come on, Sonny. Now, baby.

103
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,457
Patience.

104
00:11:21,262 --> 00:11:23,696
You said you wanted to get
what you paid for.

105
00:11:23,765 --> 00:11:25,961
I'm telling you what I want.

106
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:30,600
I'm afraid your time is up.

107
00:11:31,173 --> 00:11:33,233
But we haven't done anything yet.

108
00:11:34,811 --> 00:11:37,837
A conversation is all you get from me
for $100.

109
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:00,098
Now I know why your mother calls you
a natural-born whore.

110
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:06,671
That's not the reason.

111
00:12:31,743 --> 00:12:32,710
Oh, God.

112
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,535
I'll be gentle.

113
00:12:40,653 --> 00:12:41,642
Boo.

114
00:12:42,856 --> 00:12:46,383
Old thieves never die. They just never die.

115
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:50,461
Damn, boy, where do you get off
joining the Army and being gone so long?

116
00:12:50,965 --> 00:12:53,559
Just trying to get away from Mama
for a while.

117
00:12:53,634 --> 00:12:56,296
Which is more than I can say
you've ever been able to do.

118
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:00,831
Old Jewel would go out of her mind
if she didn't have me to look after her.

119
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:02,875
Making any money?

120
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:06,438
I pay my rent and have a drink
now and then. I don't need much.

121
00:13:10,053 --> 00:13:12,488
That little gal in there any good?

122
00:13:13,057 --> 00:13:16,584
What do you mean? She's been living
here three months and you don't know?

123
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,097
I don't lie, boy.
Your mama would feed me to the chickens...

124
00:13:20,165 --> 00:13:22,793
if she found me messing
with one of her girls.

125
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:26,861
I just like to do a little speculating
now and then. You know what I mean.

126
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,467
Breakfast is ready.
You two get in here before it gets cold.

127
00:13:31,712 --> 00:13:34,681
All right, hold your horses, woman.
We're coming.

128
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:37,047
-You hungry?
-Yeah.

129
00:13:40,221 --> 00:13:43,190
Wake up, you fine little outlaw
from Arkansas.

130
00:13:43,925 --> 00:13:48,022
Henry Wade, you lecherous old cocksucker.
I told you not to do that anymore.

131
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,302
I'm gonna take it in a little bit right here.

132
00:13:54,371 --> 00:13:57,534
Give it a nice taper
through the shoulders and the back.

133
00:13:57,741 --> 00:13:58,935
That's great.

134
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:01,938
I like a nice tight fit in the back.

135
00:14:04,715 --> 00:14:07,276
Listen, Walter, I figured since I was in here...

136
00:14:07,352 --> 00:14:10,844
I'd ask you if there's any work here
available in the store.

137
00:14:11,623 --> 00:14:13,649
I mean, I've got some other options...

138
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,387
but I thought I might ask.

139
00:14:15,495 --> 00:14:17,793
I really like this material.

140
00:14:18,631 --> 00:14:20,691
I'll think about it, Sonny.

141
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,496
Time for a career change?

142
00:14:31,546 --> 00:14:33,309
Oh, my God, Sonny?

143
00:14:33,815 --> 00:14:35,613
When did you get in town?

144
00:14:37,953 --> 00:14:40,922
-Mr. Phillips, will there be anything else?
-No, that's it.

145
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,152
This will be ready in a couple of days...

146
00:14:43,226 --> 00:14:45,558
and I'll wrap up
those other items you wanted.

147
00:14:45,662 --> 00:14:47,129
Okay, thank you.

148
00:14:48,031 --> 00:14:50,500
Yeah, I just got back yesterday.

149
00:14:51,936 --> 00:14:55,133
It's been so many years since I've seen you.
Where did you go?

150
00:14:55,206 --> 00:14:56,799
I was in the Army.

151
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:59,969
Yes, I remember now. Somebody told me.

152
00:15:00,045 --> 00:15:03,482
Sonny, what in the world
would you wanna go join the Army for?

153
00:15:06,853 --> 00:15:09,048
I don't think you'd understand.

154
00:15:10,357 --> 00:15:12,188
I'm terribly sorry.

155
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:16,195
Sonny Phillips, this is Catherine Putnam.

156
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,460
Hi. Nice to meet you, Catherine.
It's a pleasure.

157
00:15:19,568 --> 00:15:22,196
Sonny is a dear old friend of mine.

158
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:27,571
-I'm sorry. It's Meg.
-How's your husband, Meg?

159
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:32,771
I traded that old dud in for a new one,
since I've seen you.

160
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,943
I met a very nice, quiet little surgeon...

161
00:15:37,322 --> 00:15:39,654
who's an absolute dear. He really is.

162
00:15:40,191 --> 00:15:44,356
The only trouble is he watches
how much money I'm spending too closely.

163
00:15:45,631 --> 00:15:47,223
I'm sure you'll manage.

164
00:15:51,036 --> 00:15:53,938
I see you still have your taste in clothes.

165
00:15:55,308 --> 00:15:56,866
Are you still...

166
00:15:57,911 --> 00:15:58,970
working?

167
00:16:00,014 --> 00:16:01,003
No.

168
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:05,247
I'm just here spending
some of my discharge money.

169
00:16:07,656 --> 00:16:09,556
That's a real shame.

170
00:16:09,758 --> 00:16:11,953
What happened? Did the Army break you?

171
00:16:12,562 --> 00:16:14,086
Yeah, I guess.

172
00:16:15,131 --> 00:16:17,622
That'll be $432.82.

173
00:16:20,337 --> 00:16:21,827
Can I help you?

174
00:16:26,545 --> 00:16:28,979
Sonny is the young man
I was telling you about...

175
00:16:29,047 --> 00:16:32,039
who used to spend so much time with me
at the lake.

176
00:16:37,523 --> 00:16:39,388
This is an occasion.

177
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,151
Would you have a drink with us?

178
00:16:43,897 --> 00:16:46,331
-Just a drink.
-A drink, right now?

179
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,234
-Just a drink, you dirty youngster, you.
-Come on.

180
00:16:49,637 --> 00:16:52,902
-Catherine's all right, we can talk.
-No doubt about that.

181
00:16:56,212 --> 00:16:57,702
It's tempting.

182
00:16:59,048 --> 00:17:02,485
Your change.
And I'll let you know if anything changes...

183
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:05,749
but I don't foresee any openings
in the near future.

184
00:17:06,856 --> 00:17:08,290
Okay, thanks a lot.

185
00:17:08,826 --> 00:17:10,589
Please, just one drink?

186
00:17:11,495 --> 00:17:13,395
-A small drink.
-Come on, be a sport.

187
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:15,194
I don't know if I can pass this up.

188
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:18,031
Come on, honey. It's so nice to see you.

189
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:36,589
Baby, I'm so glad you're home.

190
00:17:36,658 --> 00:17:39,422
Henry is in jail.
He called me about an hour ago.

191
00:17:40,495 --> 00:17:43,556
-What's he in jail for?
-Shoplifting.

192
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,798
Why are you getting upset? He's been
in jail for that more times than I can count.

193
00:17:48,871 --> 00:17:50,237
I know.

194
00:17:50,307 --> 00:17:52,775
I just get so worried sometimes.

195
00:17:54,077 --> 00:17:56,911
Henry's getting too old
to be going to jail every week.

196
00:17:57,015 --> 00:18:00,348
He's all I got. Anything happens to him,
I don't know what I'd do.

197
00:18:00,418 --> 00:18:02,784
All right. Did you call the bondsman?

198
00:18:03,154 --> 00:18:05,646
He's gonna meet us down at the jail...

199
00:18:06,392 --> 00:18:08,189
as soon as Carol gets back.

200
00:18:08,727 --> 00:18:10,388
Why when Carol gets back?

201
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,461
Sonny, you've been gone over three years.
Things change.

202
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:18,534
The bondsman knows I got a girl with me.

203
00:18:19,273 --> 00:18:21,673
Henry won't get out till Monday morning...

204
00:18:21,742 --> 00:18:25,543
unless Carol comes with us
and spends a few minutes with him.

205
00:18:38,962 --> 00:18:43,126
I'm sorry I didn't ask you first
about Carol coming with us.

206
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:48,330
I just kept thinking of poor old Henry
laying up in that jail for three days.

207
00:18:52,344 --> 00:18:56,008
That's all right, Mama.
If that's how you've been dealing with it...

208
00:18:56,115 --> 00:18:58,242
nothing we can do about it now.

209
00:18:59,385 --> 00:19:02,116
-I love you, Sonny-boy.
-I love you, Mom.

210
00:19:13,368 --> 00:19:14,461
What's the matter?

211
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,970
Shut up, God damn it.
I don't want Sonny to hear.

212
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,233
Hear what?

213
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,205
Henry's in jail.

214
00:19:20,376 --> 00:19:23,642
-So? What else is new?
-I want him out tonight.

215
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:28,943
Call the bondsman, like you always do,
and tell him to send a runner for the money.

216
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:31,385
I'm going to shower. It's been a long day.

217
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:34,584
Now you listen to me, bitch.
You better listen good.

218
00:19:36,261 --> 00:19:38,661
You don't know Sonny like I do.

219
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:42,665
You spend one night with him,
you think he'll do anything for you.

220
00:19:42,835 --> 00:19:46,032
He's that way
because I trained him to be that way.

221
00:19:46,973 --> 00:19:49,772
So don't you go getting no fancy ideas...

222
00:19:49,843 --> 00:19:53,472
about running off
and living happily ever after in Texas City.

223
00:19:53,647 --> 00:19:56,344
Because he don't care a damn thing
about you.

224
00:19:56,951 --> 00:19:59,146
You still belong to me, girl.

225
00:19:59,287 --> 00:20:01,380
And you still do as I say.

226
00:20:01,756 --> 00:20:03,054
If you don't...

227
00:20:03,192 --> 00:20:06,719
I'll have you cut and thrown out
into the street for the winos.

228
00:20:07,296 --> 00:20:10,960
Sonny won't even notice you're gone.
Do I make myself clear?

229
00:20:11,935 --> 00:20:14,927
What's the matter with you?
I never seen you like this before.

230
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:18,406
You better hope
you never have to see me like this again.

231
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,571
The bondsman says he wants
to spend a little time with you tonight...

232
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,979
or he won't pull Henry till Monday.

233
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:29,048
So after we get him out of jail,
I want you to take the money to his office...

234
00:20:29,121 --> 00:20:31,613
and give him what he wants, you hear?

235
00:20:31,925 --> 00:20:35,759
He's never wanted a date before.
Why does he want one all of a sudden?

236
00:20:35,829 --> 00:20:38,822
Because I told him he could have one,
that's why.

237
00:20:43,103 --> 00:20:45,698
You'll wait for me back at the house?

238
00:20:53,449 --> 00:20:56,907
Go on and get Henry.
I'll see you in a couple of hours.

239
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:23,542
I wanna have me a baby.

240
00:21:28,723 --> 00:21:31,715
Doing this whole thing,
you ever see Mama accept you?

241
00:21:37,065 --> 00:21:39,590
I can't afford to be that realistic.

242
00:21:42,472 --> 00:21:45,566
If I look too close in the mirror,
I might see me.

243
00:21:46,175 --> 00:21:48,542
I don't think I'm quite ready for that.

244
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,548
Hand me that smoke?

245
00:22:34,598 --> 00:22:36,191
Can I have a light?

246
00:22:43,475 --> 00:22:45,272
Where's everybody at?

247
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,143
Your mama took Carol
up to Ponchatoula to work.

248
00:22:51,417 --> 00:22:53,908
She's booked for a week
at the Liberty Hotel.

249
00:22:54,187 --> 00:22:56,052
So that just leaves...

250
00:22:57,925 --> 00:22:59,222
me and you.

251
00:23:01,362 --> 00:23:04,127
Hell of a lifestyle we've got going here, man.

252
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:10,928
It's always better at night
than it is in the morning.

253
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,838
You know what you got to do, Sonny?

254
00:23:20,517 --> 00:23:23,816
You got to face the fact
that this is all there is.

255
00:23:27,225 --> 00:23:31,355
Everybody else seems to be getting
what they want without much trouble.

256
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,769
That's because you're looking at it
from your side of the fence.

257
00:23:39,406 --> 00:23:41,772
All of them squares out there....

258
00:23:41,908 --> 00:23:44,536
They got just as many problems
as you've got.

259
00:23:44,878 --> 00:23:47,040
So you think I should stay, too?

260
00:23:47,448 --> 00:23:50,042
No, I ain't saying that. I'm just....

261
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:55,820
I just want you to understand that
if you're going over to the other side...

262
00:23:55,891 --> 00:23:59,327
that you're gonna inherit
a whole new set of problems.

263
00:24:02,865 --> 00:24:05,129
Staying or going is up to you.

264
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:12,676
I care for you, boy.

265
00:24:14,713 --> 00:24:17,739
I just don't want you getting into anything...

266
00:24:18,116 --> 00:24:20,209
that you can't handle.

267
00:24:22,354 --> 00:24:23,912
I'm not stupid.

268
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,589
I know that.

269
00:24:28,428 --> 00:24:30,362
Jewel taught you a lot.

270
00:24:31,631 --> 00:24:35,033
As long as you're dealing with things
you're familiar with.

271
00:24:36,404 --> 00:24:40,135
But getting up in the morning,
going to work, raising kids...

272
00:24:40,241 --> 00:24:42,642
and joining the PTA...

273
00:24:43,912 --> 00:24:46,972
and all them other things
you're craving for....

274
00:24:48,183 --> 00:24:51,483
It's a lot different in flesh
than it is in your head.

275
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:00,494
I just don't want to get old
and not have anything to show for it.

276
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,362
You and Mama, you're gonna...

277
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:11,007
start thinking you're something ugly to me,
and that's not true.

278
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:14,936
You don't have to start feeling sorry for me.

279
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:19,442
Ain't never been a moment in my life
when I was wishing I was somebody else.

280
00:25:19,953 --> 00:25:22,751
It's me that's feeling the pity, boy.

281
00:25:30,766 --> 00:25:33,701
You think you're gonna
get that job down there?

282
00:25:36,172 --> 00:25:37,731
Yeah. I don't know.

283
00:25:39,075 --> 00:25:42,135
I got this friend Jesse I was stationed with.

284
00:25:43,246 --> 00:25:45,772
His father owns a bookstore and he said...

285
00:25:46,551 --> 00:25:49,486
when I get out, come on down,
and he'd get me a job.

286
00:25:50,154 --> 00:25:53,181
Are you sure this kid
ain't blowing smoke up your ass?

287
00:25:53,292 --> 00:25:55,692
No, Jesse is a good guy.

288
00:25:56,862 --> 00:25:58,888
He really wants me to come down.

289
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:01,799
Does he know anything
about your background?

290
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,364
Very little.

291
00:26:05,673 --> 00:26:06,662
Good.

292
00:26:07,408 --> 00:26:09,842
Good luck to you. I hope you make it.

293
00:26:11,846 --> 00:26:15,146
You don't have any idea
how much I hope you make it.

294
00:26:16,418 --> 00:26:17,476
Why?

295
00:26:27,965 --> 00:26:31,401
Maybe I just wanna see if one of us can.

296
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,700
What're you doing? Cleaning your carpet?

297
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,937
I didn't think you'd make it.

298
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,175
I need that job.

299
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:47,451
You went by the shop first?

300
00:27:48,589 --> 00:27:50,854
Yeah, they said there's a new owner.

301
00:27:52,594 --> 00:27:56,724
You wouldn't happen to be in the market
for a $50 a week meat bill, would you?

302
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,091
You look pretty happy here.

303
00:27:59,736 --> 00:28:02,261
Come on in the house, I'll buy you a beer.

304
00:28:03,106 --> 00:28:04,597
Come on, Tuck.

305
00:28:07,712 --> 00:28:09,304
So what happened?

306
00:28:09,413 --> 00:28:11,109
It was the fucking bank.

307
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:15,682
Old man got behind on some debts.

308
00:28:17,222 --> 00:28:19,453
Too proud to tell me, I guess.

309
00:28:21,194 --> 00:28:23,856
By the time I got back,
there was nothing I could do.

310
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:26,764
Not like there was anything
I could do, anyhow.

311
00:28:29,136 --> 00:28:32,106
Is there any chance
of getting anything back?

312
00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:37,637
Old man's dying of cancer.
Something else he forgets to mention.

313
00:28:37,746 --> 00:28:40,614
By the time I get back to bury him, too late.
It's over.

314
00:28:40,683 --> 00:28:42,548
No. It's already gone.

315
00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:45,148
I mean, the house is gone, too.

316
00:28:45,221 --> 00:28:49,659
I had to get a court order to keep living in it,
until I find something else.

317
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,826
This is for you.

318
00:28:57,935 --> 00:29:00,200
The Stranger. Read it, it's good.

319
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,531
-"Camus."
-Camus.

320
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:06,633
Thanks.

321
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:10,947
What are you....

322
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:13,218
What's Plan B?

323
00:29:14,021 --> 00:29:15,818
Plan B. I don't know.

324
00:29:16,323 --> 00:29:19,121
Start thinking about re-enlisting, you know?

325
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,329
Ain't no jobs around here.

326
00:29:23,565 --> 00:29:26,398
Shit. Jesse, I was hoping you could....

327
00:29:29,405 --> 00:29:31,635
-Fuck it.
-Look, man, come on.

328
00:29:31,707 --> 00:29:35,405
It ain't all rain clouds and gloom, you know.
It ain't.

329
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,811
Listen to this. While you're here,
I've got these two sisters. All right?

330
00:29:39,883 --> 00:29:42,785
-They are good-looking sisters.
-So?

331
00:29:43,855 --> 00:29:46,289
So, I go with one of them, sort of.

332
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:48,420
And the other one...

333
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,420
her older sister.

334
00:29:51,197 --> 00:29:53,427
She has an amazing area.

335
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,927
Love it.

336
00:29:58,638 --> 00:30:01,903
What, like, we'll go out on a date?

337
00:30:03,211 --> 00:30:05,008
Like, a real date?

338
00:30:07,915 --> 00:30:12,285
We're friends, right? I can ask you
a question because we're friends, right?

339
00:30:12,454 --> 00:30:14,046
Yeah, I'm a friend.

340
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:17,389
You know, there was some talk...

341
00:30:19,329 --> 00:30:20,660
back in the Army.

342
00:30:20,763 --> 00:30:24,165
You never went out
and socialized with a lady very often.

343
00:30:24,235 --> 00:30:26,726
And it is none of my business...

344
00:30:26,837 --> 00:30:29,328
but if you don't like girls, you know....

345
00:30:30,775 --> 00:30:33,608
No, it ain't that. It's just, you know....

346
00:30:34,613 --> 00:30:37,606
I ain't never been out on a real date before.

347
00:30:38,684 --> 00:30:40,549
I don't understand. Why not?

348
00:30:42,088 --> 00:30:43,783
It's a long story.

349
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:46,323
I'm not up for it now.

350
00:30:47,027 --> 00:30:49,894
I guess I'm just worried
I wouldn't know how to act.

351
00:30:51,699 --> 00:30:54,031
It's time you learned. You just be yourself.

352
00:30:54,903 --> 00:30:56,097
Smile.

353
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,006
We'll go out and have a good time.

354
00:31:33,146 --> 00:31:35,672
Why are you blowing on it? It ain't hot.

355
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:38,214
He blows on the ice cream before he eats it.

356
00:31:38,285 --> 00:31:40,618
Guess I thought it was for a second.

357
00:31:41,957 --> 00:31:44,084
You blew on the ice cream?

358
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:57,769
-What do you think?
-I liked it.

359
00:31:57,908 --> 00:31:59,739
Good. It was all right.

360
00:32:06,651 --> 00:32:08,175
Oh, yeah, rough.

361
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:10,488
First movie I've seen in a long time.

362
00:32:13,092 --> 00:32:14,286
Birds.

363
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,331
-Cold?
-Yes.

364
00:33:01,314 --> 00:33:04,079
-You think you can give that up?
-I live here!

365
00:33:06,086 --> 00:33:08,179
-Let me take that.
-Thanks.

366
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:13,258
You think we can navigate those two
over to the couch?

367
00:33:13,328 --> 00:33:16,422
Why don't we put on some music?

368
00:33:16,531 --> 00:33:18,124
You're gonna wake up Wendy.

369
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,361
Wait. You mean there's three of you here?

370
00:33:20,703 --> 00:33:23,797
-You know we had a kid sister!
-I did not.

371
00:33:23,872 --> 00:33:26,535
That's because you've never been here
in the daytime.

372
00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:27,871
That's true.

373
00:33:28,378 --> 00:33:30,710
Why don't you put on some music?

374
00:33:56,777 --> 00:33:57,971
Thanks.

375
00:34:05,954 --> 00:34:08,150
So, what do you do?

376
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,359
Do? Do what?

377
00:34:12,795 --> 00:34:14,263
For a living.

378
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:19,066
All night long
we've talked about Jesse's father...

379
00:34:19,136 --> 00:34:23,005
or my sister's sex life.
You haven't said six words about yourself.

380
00:34:25,042 --> 00:34:27,067
I don't know what I do.

381
00:34:28,347 --> 00:34:30,781
I came out here looking for a job.

382
00:34:34,319 --> 00:34:35,844
You're a strange man.

383
00:34:37,056 --> 00:34:38,080
Why?

384
00:34:39,893 --> 00:34:41,656
I don't quite know.

385
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:45,960
You're a funny mix.

386
00:34:47,435 --> 00:34:48,869
Something...

387
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,271
real smooth and easy...

388
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:56,076
and kind of awkward, like a little kid.

389
00:35:02,084 --> 00:35:04,952
I'm just going through a transition thing.

390
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:09,054
I'll get more relaxed as I go.

391
00:35:27,581 --> 00:35:29,105
What are you doing?

392
00:35:29,282 --> 00:35:31,410
Are you making a move on me?

393
00:35:34,088 --> 00:35:35,612
Yeah, I guess.

394
00:35:38,794 --> 00:35:40,659
That's okay, isn't it?

395
00:35:41,697 --> 00:35:43,392
Yeah, that's okay.

396
00:35:45,702 --> 00:35:46,999
I promise that.

397
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,471
Oh, my God!

398
00:35:53,377 --> 00:35:55,777
That was amazing!

399
00:35:58,884 --> 00:36:01,648
You know, you should do that for a living.

400
00:36:08,294 --> 00:36:09,352
I do.

401
00:36:15,836 --> 00:36:16,825
What?

402
00:36:17,404 --> 00:36:18,996
I mean, I used to.

403
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:24,440
What do you mean, you used to?

404
00:36:26,448 --> 00:36:29,178
You asked me what I did out there.

405
00:36:32,321 --> 00:36:34,017
I used to be a whore.

406
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,836
What do you mean
that you used to be a whore?

407
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,799
Only women are whores.

408
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:55,942
Now you're starting to sound like a man.

409
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:09,287
Wait a minute.
I thought you were in the Army.

410
00:37:09,564 --> 00:37:11,532
-With Jesse--
-I was.

411
00:37:11,633 --> 00:37:14,625
I was. This is before the Army.

412
00:37:16,405 --> 00:37:18,339
I don't do it anymore.

413
00:37:20,409 --> 00:37:22,571
I'm through with that world.

414
00:37:24,781 --> 00:37:27,011
I like this world much better.

415
00:37:27,551 --> 00:37:28,540
I do.

416
00:37:44,004 --> 00:37:45,494
You know what?

417
00:37:45,672 --> 00:37:49,665
I have to go to the bathroom.
So stay right here, okay?

418
00:37:50,378 --> 00:37:51,902
I'll be right back.

419
00:38:06,629 --> 00:38:09,928
I just told you that
because I wanted to be honest....

420
00:38:10,066 --> 00:38:11,329
What's that?

421
00:38:12,803 --> 00:38:15,863
I have asthma. So sometimes I can't sleep.

422
00:38:16,774 --> 00:38:19,107
You think I don't know what this shit is?

423
00:38:19,811 --> 00:38:21,904
No, it's just cough syrup.

424
00:38:22,147 --> 00:38:24,775
You think I haven't seen people
with stomach habits?

425
00:38:24,983 --> 00:38:26,383
It's cough syrup!

426
00:38:26,585 --> 00:38:29,486
Fucking Codeine.
How bad are you strung out?

427
00:38:30,956 --> 00:38:31,945
What?

428
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,787
What's the matter with you?

429
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:40,834
I'm crazy?

430
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,893
Isn't anyone in the world straight anymore?

431
00:38:43,004 --> 00:38:44,130
Stop that!

432
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:47,740
What're you doing? Don't touch my stuff!

433
00:38:49,311 --> 00:38:51,108
Stop it! No!

434
00:38:52,448 --> 00:38:55,475
You're spilling my medicine!

435
00:38:55,552 --> 00:38:56,849
Fuck you!

436
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:04,792
-What's going on, man?
-Your friend's a junkie.

437
00:39:04,862 --> 00:39:08,094
She's not a junkie.
She drinks cough syrup, all right?

438
00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:11,258
-You mean, you knew?
-Yeah, so what?

439
00:39:11,837 --> 00:39:13,805
So what? I guzzle beer.

440
00:39:14,173 --> 00:39:17,665
You break shit.
She drinks cough syrup. So what?

441
00:39:17,777 --> 00:39:21,043
-It's supposed to be different.
-What's supposed to be different?

442
00:39:21,115 --> 00:39:23,913
You, her, the whole thing
is supposed to be different.

443
00:39:23,984 --> 00:39:25,952
-What's going on?
-Just go back to bed.

444
00:39:26,019 --> 00:39:27,680
I want him out of here!

445
00:39:27,755 --> 00:39:29,189
Why? Am I unclean?

446
00:39:29,257 --> 00:39:31,817
Am I not clean enough for you? Am I sick?

447
00:39:31,893 --> 00:39:35,193
Is that why?
I'm better than all you bullshit squares!

448
00:39:35,264 --> 00:39:38,358
-Get him out of here!
-Then you can go back to your fucking life!

449
00:39:38,434 --> 00:39:40,561
-Go to bed.
-Get him out of here.

450
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:43,631
You want me out?
Get the fuck away from me!

451
00:39:43,707 --> 00:39:45,698
-I said everything's fine!
-Get away!

452
00:39:45,776 --> 00:39:47,903
Why don't you get the fuck out?

453
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,479
Get the fuck away from me!

454
00:39:49,614 --> 00:39:51,639
You want me out of your house?

455
00:39:51,749 --> 00:39:54,809
You want me out of here?
Will that make you happy?

456
00:39:54,886 --> 00:39:58,254
You want me out? All right,
you can go back to your fucking life!

457
00:39:59,124 --> 00:40:01,183
Get the fuck away from me!

458
00:40:02,294 --> 00:40:03,319
Cool it.

459
00:40:03,396 --> 00:40:06,729
I'm better than you!
I'm better than all of you!

460
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,862
Fuck you!

461
00:41:27,425 --> 00:41:28,983
You out all night?

462
00:41:30,829 --> 00:41:33,127
Yeah, I tried not to wake you.

463
00:41:47,582 --> 00:41:48,708
Adonis.

464
00:41:52,153 --> 00:41:53,950
You going out again?

465
00:41:57,293 --> 00:41:59,727
Aren't you gonna wear your white suit?

466
00:41:59,828 --> 00:42:02,059
It always looked so good on you.

467
00:42:03,266 --> 00:42:06,394
Why don't you just let me wear
what I want to wear?

468
00:42:10,341 --> 00:42:12,832
Not quite like you thought, was it?

469
00:42:14,345 --> 00:42:16,473
I don't wanna talk about it.

470
00:42:17,316 --> 00:42:18,783
I know, baby.

471
00:42:19,084 --> 00:42:20,881
I know, I understand.

472
00:42:22,187 --> 00:42:24,383
You go on about your business...

473
00:42:24,457 --> 00:42:27,119
and I'll call around town,
see what's going on for you.

474
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,491
I can take care of myself.

475
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,558
Sonny, my baby.

476
00:42:37,072 --> 00:42:40,064
I was so scared
I was gonna lose you forever.

477
00:42:41,509 --> 00:42:42,874
I need you.

478
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:47,907
Ain't got no pension, no nothing.
I just got you.

479
00:42:48,751 --> 00:42:51,880
You're the only thing
I got to show for my life.

480
00:42:52,422 --> 00:42:55,755
You're the only good thing
that ever happened to me.

481
00:42:56,226 --> 00:42:58,286
I need you. You're all I got!

482
00:42:58,363 --> 00:42:59,955
You're gonna wrinkle my shirt.

483
00:43:00,031 --> 00:43:02,795
Tell me you know you're all I got.

484
00:43:02,867 --> 00:43:05,632
-Come on, I gotta go!
-Tell me, damn you!

485
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,753
I know.

486
00:43:26,428 --> 00:43:27,952
Oh, God, Sonny!

487
00:43:49,821 --> 00:43:51,413
Did you make it?

488
00:43:54,226 --> 00:43:56,524
I'm sorry. I tried not to...

489
00:43:56,962 --> 00:43:58,987
but I guess I'm out of practice.

490
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,090
You mad at me?

491
00:44:02,169 --> 00:44:04,399
Oh, baby, I'm not mad at you.

492
00:44:04,871 --> 00:44:08,205
I couldn't be mad at you.
That's what you're here for.

493
00:44:08,376 --> 00:44:10,173
I just wanted to spend more time.

494
00:44:11,479 --> 00:44:13,470
We are so good together.

495
00:44:14,483 --> 00:44:17,247
I just wanted to please you.
Could you tell that?

496
00:44:17,319 --> 00:44:18,946
-You did it.
-Did l?

497
00:44:24,394 --> 00:44:26,794
-I missed you, lady.
-Did you really?

498
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:30,662
Yeah, I sure did.

499
00:44:33,571 --> 00:44:35,437
Well, I better get....

500
00:44:48,788 --> 00:44:50,188
Oh, my God!

501
00:44:55,129 --> 00:44:57,098
Do you have to get back pretty soon?

502
00:45:02,871 --> 00:45:04,464
What time is it?

503
00:45:05,307 --> 00:45:06,399
10:00.

504
00:45:07,576 --> 00:45:09,134
Shit!

505
00:45:10,647 --> 00:45:13,548
I gotta pick up Harry at the airport at 11:00.

506
00:45:16,686 --> 00:45:18,484
I have to see you again.

507
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,285
I gotta see you again.

508
00:45:22,226 --> 00:45:25,924
-Where can I get in touch with you?
-I'll give you my number.

509
00:45:31,237 --> 00:45:33,137
I'd do it every week...

510
00:45:33,373 --> 00:45:36,137
but you know how it is.
New husband, new rules.

511
00:45:36,209 --> 00:45:39,270
I'll find a way around it somehow,
I know I will.

512
00:45:40,214 --> 00:45:42,409
You can call me here anytime.

513
00:45:42,883 --> 00:45:44,818
Just leave me your name...

514
00:45:45,687 --> 00:45:48,986
and the number you're at,
and when you wanna do it.

515
00:45:51,961 --> 00:45:53,189
Thank you.

516
00:45:59,236 --> 00:46:01,363
You're gonna miss that plane.

517
00:46:01,572 --> 00:46:02,869
Oh, yeah.

518
00:46:07,745 --> 00:46:08,905
Sorry.

519
00:46:10,882 --> 00:46:13,113
I wasn't thinking about it, I guess.

520
00:46:14,687 --> 00:46:17,520
Oh, baby, I only have $150 in cash.

521
00:46:18,023 --> 00:46:19,855
Can I write you a check?

522
00:46:22,329 --> 00:46:24,820
You know that I can't take a check, Meg.

523
00:46:26,968 --> 00:46:28,435
That's right.

524
00:46:29,437 --> 00:46:33,100
Oh, boy, I certainly can't write a check
for this one, either.

525
00:46:36,378 --> 00:46:37,367
Sorry.

526
00:46:40,783 --> 00:46:42,410
It's no big deal.

527
00:46:42,852 --> 00:46:44,649
We're friends, right?

528
00:46:46,856 --> 00:46:49,519
Maybe you can do a little favor for me.

529
00:46:49,727 --> 00:46:53,754
Any of your friends want a date,
maybe you can have them call me.

530
00:46:56,568 --> 00:46:59,002
Yeah, I'll do what I can.

531
00:47:00,272 --> 00:47:01,535
I just....

532
00:47:02,141 --> 00:47:04,609
I haven't been around for a while...

533
00:47:04,744 --> 00:47:07,008
and I don't really know anyone anymore.

534
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:08,911
I'll make a call for you.

535
00:47:11,551 --> 00:47:13,178
I gotta get going.

536
00:47:13,253 --> 00:47:14,914
I'll see you, then.

537
00:47:30,907 --> 00:47:32,033
Nothing.

538
00:47:33,777 --> 00:47:35,836
I'll help you all I can, angel.

539
00:47:37,982 --> 00:47:40,974
Thanks, Meg, I could really use it right now.

540
00:47:42,186 --> 00:47:43,175
'Bye.

541
00:47:47,292 --> 00:47:49,624
Yeah, is Mattie Sullivan there?

542
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:52,625
Tell her it's Sonny Phillips.

543
00:47:54,334 --> 00:47:56,461
Mattie, there's a telephone call for you.

544
00:47:56,536 --> 00:47:57,902
Excuse me.

545
00:47:58,405 --> 00:48:01,238
I'll take it upstairs with my mint julep.

546
00:48:04,713 --> 00:48:06,476
Have a good time, Jimmy?

547
00:48:06,548 --> 00:48:09,779
Mattie, there's never a dull moment
in your place.

548
00:48:10,852 --> 00:48:12,081
Come on, baby.

549
00:48:15,725 --> 00:48:16,692
Hello?

550
00:48:19,996 --> 00:48:21,725
I'll be damned.

551
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:24,023
Jewel said you were back.

552
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,705
About an hour ago.
She said you were working.

553
00:48:29,107 --> 00:48:32,305
Come on! You know she's just
trying to look after you.

554
00:48:35,547 --> 00:48:38,607
I got one for you right now,
if you're available.

555
00:48:39,252 --> 00:48:41,117
No, a road trip.

556
00:48:41,354 --> 00:48:42,321
Dress date.

557
00:48:42,822 --> 00:48:44,551
Gabe, you got a pen?

558
00:48:45,158 --> 00:48:47,150
-Here you go, Sonny.
-Thanks.

559
00:48:47,795 --> 00:48:49,057
Go ahead.

560
00:48:58,874 --> 00:49:00,672
Wait, hold on a minute.

561
00:49:01,144 --> 00:49:03,704
How about I work it as a plainclothesman?

562
00:49:05,681 --> 00:49:06,670
All right.

563
00:49:07,484 --> 00:49:09,952
I'll call Henry.
He'll know where I can get one.

564
00:49:13,223 --> 00:49:14,589
Get out here!

565
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:18,455
He's coming, baby.

566
00:49:21,233 --> 00:49:23,929
Can't even take a crap in peace anymore.

567
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:26,471
-What do you want?
-Shut up and come talk to Sonny.

568
00:49:26,539 --> 00:49:28,565
He needs something.

569
00:49:35,283 --> 00:49:37,046
How's it going, boy?

570
00:49:43,158 --> 00:49:46,127
I got a friend of mine that's working nights.

571
00:49:46,695 --> 00:49:48,663
I can probably borrow his.

572
00:49:49,466 --> 00:49:50,990
How was Texas City?

573
00:49:58,108 --> 00:50:01,305
That's all right.
Something better will come along.

574
00:50:02,046 --> 00:50:03,981
Sorry it didn't work out.

575
00:50:05,851 --> 00:50:10,152
Yeah, I'm pretty sure. Just come
by the house in about an hour...

576
00:50:10,423 --> 00:50:12,948
and I'll have it for you, all right?

577
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,455
I'll see you then.

578
00:50:20,501 --> 00:50:22,969
You didn't even give the boy a chance.

579
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:26,336
Don't worry about it.
He's doing what he's best at.

580
00:50:26,541 --> 00:50:28,008
Yeah, that's right.

581
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:30,270
Driving himself off a cliff.

582
00:50:30,512 --> 00:50:32,276
Just like you taught him, right?

583
00:50:37,988 --> 00:50:39,478
I hope it fits.

584
00:50:39,556 --> 00:50:41,717
Don't matter, as long as I can get it on.

585
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,884
Remember Albert,
the guy who fences my stuff?

586
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,453
He says he can get you on to the Safeway
warehouse over on Cooper Street.

587
00:50:47,532 --> 00:50:50,228
Wouldn't pay much to start,
but you can work your way up.

588
00:50:50,334 --> 00:50:52,735
Half the people in the Quarter
know me as a whore.

589
00:50:52,838 --> 00:50:54,635
No one's gonna give me a straight job.

590
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:57,368
That's bullshit.
Albert says he can get you on.

591
00:50:57,442 --> 00:50:58,500
I gotta go.

592
00:50:58,577 --> 00:51:02,070
You're 26 years old. How much longer
do you think you can keep this up?

593
00:51:02,148 --> 00:51:03,479
As long as I have to.

594
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:06,349
It's a young man's game, Sonny.
Time to change.

595
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:09,389
You're gonna make me blow the trick.
I'm late anyway.

596
00:51:09,456 --> 00:51:11,549
At least just think about it.

597
00:51:36,487 --> 00:51:40,048
I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am,
there's been a report...

598
00:51:40,692 --> 00:51:42,786
of a prowler in the area...

599
00:51:43,429 --> 00:51:46,523
and I'd really like to come in
and check things out, if I may.

600
00:51:47,132 --> 00:51:49,624
I'm sorry, but my husband
isn't home right now.

601
00:51:51,271 --> 00:51:54,673
That's okay, it won't take but a minute.

602
00:51:58,179 --> 00:51:59,146
Please...

603
00:52:00,047 --> 00:52:03,484
I think you'd feel a lot better
if I come check things out.

604
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,480
Okay, but just for a moment.

605
00:52:07,356 --> 00:52:08,516
Thank you.

606
00:52:15,598 --> 00:52:17,533
So you're here all alone?

607
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:20,968
Yes, my husband's out of town on business.

608
00:52:26,878 --> 00:52:28,505
Where do you sleep?

609
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:30,671
Upstairs. Why?

610
00:52:33,419 --> 00:52:37,015
I'd like to make sure
the bedroom is secure...

611
00:52:37,658 --> 00:52:40,991
because this house
will take all day to check.

612
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:46,330
Don't you guys all work in pairs?
Where's the other one?

613
00:52:48,169 --> 00:52:49,431
The other one?

614
00:52:49,737 --> 00:52:53,572
Yeah, my partner, he's checking next door.

615
00:52:55,044 --> 00:52:56,807
So, where's the bedroom?

616
00:52:59,282 --> 00:53:00,214
This way.

617
00:53:12,531 --> 00:53:13,623
This is it.

618
00:53:18,571 --> 00:53:20,698
It doesn't look like he's in here.

619
00:53:21,541 --> 00:53:22,940
Maybe he got away.

620
00:54:03,722 --> 00:54:06,122
All right, lady, you're under arrest.

621
00:54:06,458 --> 00:54:08,586
Please, I don't want to go to jail.

622
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:10,690
So, you're gonna resist.

623
00:54:11,231 --> 00:54:14,258
I'm gonna have to handcuff you
to the cot here.

624
00:54:15,069 --> 00:54:16,331
Please.

625
00:54:31,854 --> 00:54:34,516
Please. I'll do anything you ask.

626
00:54:34,724 --> 00:54:36,852
Just don't take me to jail.

627
00:54:39,163 --> 00:54:40,687
-Anything?
-Yes.

628
00:54:41,532 --> 00:54:43,000
Anything you want.

629
00:54:46,871 --> 00:54:48,634
Leave the uniform on.

630
00:54:59,619 --> 00:55:00,779
Oh, God!

631
00:55:04,692 --> 00:55:05,989
The stick.

632
00:55:07,328 --> 00:55:08,590
Use the stick.

633
00:55:56,217 --> 00:55:57,616
This is only $200.

634
00:55:59,955 --> 00:56:00,922
I know.

635
00:56:03,025 --> 00:56:04,686
The price is $300.

636
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:09,161
$200 is all I'm gonna give you.

637
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:15,302
I'm sorry you feel that way.

638
00:56:16,474 --> 00:56:18,374
What the hell's the matter with you?

639
00:56:18,442 --> 00:56:21,776
Here I am, a nice young kid,
trying to work my way through college.

640
00:56:21,847 --> 00:56:25,408
Fucking sleazy old broads like you.
I can't even get paid for it!

641
00:56:25,817 --> 00:56:27,877
-What about here?
-What are you doing?

642
00:56:27,987 --> 00:56:31,320
-This is probably worth $300.
-No, please!

643
00:56:32,358 --> 00:56:33,986
It's a little heavy.

644
00:56:40,734 --> 00:56:42,134
That should do it.

645
00:56:44,306 --> 00:56:46,501
What am I going to do with a busted TV?

646
00:56:46,574 --> 00:56:49,510
-I said okay.
-I can't hear you. What?

647
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:51,579
How much can I get for these?

648
00:56:52,648 --> 00:56:54,479
All right, I'll pay you!

649
00:57:09,535 --> 00:57:10,934
There, whore.

650
00:57:12,504 --> 00:57:14,131
Take your money and go.

651
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,892
Mind if I go pick up Carol in Ponchatoula?

652
00:58:10,103 --> 00:58:12,937
No, I'll call her. Let her know you're coming.

653
00:58:14,342 --> 00:58:16,867
You two are gonna
work some doubles together?

654
00:58:16,944 --> 00:58:19,038
Yeah, we'll see what's out there.

655
00:58:19,715 --> 00:58:23,082
I'll call around.
Let people know you're working again.

656
00:58:29,459 --> 00:58:30,619
Thanks, Mama.

657
00:58:31,594 --> 00:58:33,529
How was that trick Mattie gave you?

658
00:58:33,631 --> 00:58:36,828
It was okay. Just a straight $300 dress thing.

659
00:58:37,935 --> 00:58:39,266
She got any more?

660
00:58:39,671 --> 00:58:41,263
I'll call and find out.

661
00:58:42,974 --> 00:58:44,100
Thanks, Mama.

662
00:58:53,319 --> 00:58:56,551
Papa Legba, Papa Legba.

663
00:58:56,824 --> 00:59:00,021
Keeper of the crossroads,
and guardian of the flame.

664
00:59:03,231 --> 00:59:06,530
I'm trying to get a little one back again.
I know you can help me.

665
00:59:06,701 --> 00:59:08,169
And I do miss her.

666
00:59:16,113 --> 00:59:17,740
-How you doing?
-My man.

667
00:59:18,181 --> 00:59:20,445
I'm all right, it's been a long time.

668
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:21,950
-Cool.
-How are you?

669
00:59:22,019 --> 00:59:24,180
-I'm fine, man.
-Good.

670
00:59:25,623 --> 00:59:27,147
I'm working again.

671
00:59:28,092 --> 00:59:30,084
Wondering if you had anything for me.

672
00:59:30,162 --> 00:59:34,360
Damn, we hardly ever get any more calls
around here for pony rides.

673
00:59:34,433 --> 00:59:37,232
But every once in a while,
we get a farmer's wife...

674
00:59:37,303 --> 00:59:39,533
that comes here for a grudge fuck.

675
00:59:42,343 --> 00:59:45,676
I don't want any of them mojo women.
They're bad energy.

676
00:59:46,881 --> 00:59:48,712
You get anything good, call me.

677
00:59:48,782 --> 00:59:53,243
You know you get the first crack at any
class chicks I get coming through here.

678
00:59:54,055 --> 00:59:55,044
Carol ready?

679
00:59:55,157 --> 00:59:57,718
That's right.
Jewel did call and say you was with her.

680
00:59:57,793 --> 01:00:00,387
Let me call and let her know you're here.

681
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:09,499
Carol, Sonny's here to pick you up.

682
01:00:11,009 --> 01:00:12,499
Cool, I'll tell him.

683
01:00:14,946 --> 01:00:16,914
Man, she'll be right down.

684
01:00:19,285 --> 01:00:21,480
It was the good old days, wasn't it?

685
01:00:22,955 --> 01:00:25,789
I don't know. I was too young to remember.

686
01:00:30,096 --> 01:00:31,120
Hey, baby.

687
01:00:32,433 --> 01:00:33,695
Hey there, mama.

688
01:00:34,168 --> 01:00:36,762
-Hey there, pretty girl.
-How are you?

689
01:00:37,572 --> 01:00:41,031
-Come on, let's get out of here.
-Tally it up, old man.

690
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:44,643
I'm gonna get home
and give my man something nice.

691
01:00:46,749 --> 01:00:47,909
All right.

692
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:55,549
That looks like a shotgun hole.

693
01:00:57,928 --> 01:00:59,521
It was a long time ago.

694
01:01:01,666 --> 01:01:03,930
Twenty years ago
my mama used to work here.

695
01:01:04,002 --> 01:01:08,133
One day this Texas pimp came in,
tried to steal her back to Dallas.

696
01:01:09,375 --> 01:01:11,775
She runs to the room and calls my daddy.

697
01:01:12,478 --> 01:01:15,971
My daddy runs through that door
with this sawed-off shotgun.

698
01:01:16,617 --> 01:01:18,608
Pimp's sitting right over here.

699
01:01:19,253 --> 01:01:23,714
And my dad lets this load of
double-ought buckshot right past his nose.

700
01:01:24,525 --> 01:01:28,724
That pimp was up, out of here.
Never heard from again.

701
01:01:30,299 --> 01:01:33,530
That's the only story
my mama ever told me about my daddy.

702
01:01:34,204 --> 01:01:36,798
-What happened to him?
-I don't know.

703
01:01:37,974 --> 01:01:40,738
I never met him. He just up and left.

704
01:01:42,046 --> 01:01:43,775
Mama won't talk about him.

705
01:01:44,849 --> 01:01:46,942
I don't even know what he looked like.

706
01:01:47,018 --> 01:01:49,613
Cal, you remember
what my daddy looked like?

707
01:01:49,721 --> 01:01:51,154
I remember nothing.

708
01:01:52,057 --> 01:01:53,422
So it goes.

709
01:01:57,163 --> 01:01:59,654
-How was your week?
-Terrible.

710
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:02,197
Doesn't seem to get any better.

711
01:02:02,303 --> 01:02:04,703
-Why don't you quit?
-And do what?

712
01:02:05,939 --> 01:02:10,138
Troy, who loaned us his car, has been
asking me to marry him for over a year.

713
01:02:10,211 --> 01:02:12,771
I keep waiting
for something better to happen.

714
01:02:13,148 --> 01:02:15,048
You might be waiting a long time.

715
01:02:15,116 --> 01:02:18,450
I don't know about that.
I kind of like being wooed.

716
01:02:19,955 --> 01:02:21,650
You want to work together?

717
01:02:21,724 --> 01:02:24,751
I don't care what we're doing,
as long as I'm with you.

718
01:02:25,495 --> 01:02:27,929
Mama's trying to hook up
some doubles for us.

719
01:02:28,031 --> 01:02:30,796
If you want to try it out,
we can see how it goes.

720
01:02:30,902 --> 01:02:32,335
That's fine with me.

721
01:02:33,971 --> 01:02:35,302
How was your week?

722
01:02:36,074 --> 01:02:37,633
It was all right.

723
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:42,672
Thanks, baby.

724
01:02:49,589 --> 01:02:52,150
Wait a minute. Hold your fucking horses.

725
01:02:52,893 --> 01:02:56,989
You can't even see them things.
What are you taking so long for?

726
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:03,663
I know you can't use a 10 of clubs,
you old fuck.

727
01:03:03,972 --> 01:03:06,134
Only one way to find out.

728
01:03:11,347 --> 01:03:13,111
Henry, when you're right...

729
01:03:14,418 --> 01:03:15,646
you're wrong.

730
01:03:16,987 --> 01:03:17,976
Gin.

731
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:20,487
I don't know.

732
01:03:21,092 --> 01:03:24,926
That's a double snide, and two 2s.... $40.

733
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,101
We're home, in town.

734
01:03:35,242 --> 01:03:36,800
Sonny, baby!

735
01:03:38,078 --> 01:03:39,979
Here, let me get that.

736
01:03:40,548 --> 01:03:43,813
-You had a good week, honey?
-More or less.

737
01:03:43,885 --> 01:03:45,079
Any calls?

738
01:03:45,553 --> 01:03:48,114
Yeah, things are really jumping.

739
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:51,550
Meg called for you.
She's gonna call back later today.

740
01:03:51,727 --> 01:03:55,687
Troy's been driving me nuts.
Said you were supposed to see him today.

741
01:03:55,865 --> 01:03:58,265
He can wait. I'm going to take a shower.

742
01:03:58,701 --> 01:04:01,432
Probably just wants to ask me
to marry him again.

743
01:04:11,149 --> 01:04:13,083
Hey there, old timer.

744
01:04:13,118 --> 01:04:15,087
How are you doing, sweetheart?

745
01:04:15,254 --> 01:04:17,984
Don't you "sweetheart" me, Henry Wade.

746
01:04:18,758 --> 01:04:21,090
You ain't getting off that easy this year.

747
01:04:21,562 --> 01:04:24,963
-What are you talking about?
-You know what I'm talking about.

748
01:04:25,766 --> 01:04:27,290
Tomorrow's my birthday...

749
01:04:27,367 --> 01:04:29,962
and you promised
you'll take me to Antoine's.

750
01:04:30,438 --> 01:04:34,397
Ain't been there since my glory days,
and I want to go this year.

751
01:04:35,243 --> 01:04:38,975
God, I'm sorry, honey. I plum forgot.

752
01:04:40,115 --> 01:04:42,983
-Could we just do it next year?
-Fuck that.

753
01:04:43,186 --> 01:04:45,586
I ain't made no money in a while.

754
01:04:46,056 --> 01:04:49,116
Besides that,
I hate them goddamn stuck-up places.

755
01:04:49,192 --> 01:04:52,754
What about them three cameras
you got out of that car yesterday?

756
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:55,125
Them was cheap cameras, Jewel.

757
01:04:55,299 --> 01:04:59,100
Albert gave me enough for my room rent
and to buy a little something to drink.

758
01:04:59,171 --> 01:05:00,502
You could take me out...

759
01:05:00,572 --> 01:05:03,474
if you didn't spend your money
guzzling whiskey and gambling.

760
01:05:03,543 --> 01:05:05,704
The only thing you're good at is losing.

761
01:05:05,778 --> 01:05:09,214
You hold on, woman!
We've been through all this before.

762
01:05:09,482 --> 01:05:12,418
I don't say nothing about
your ass getting fatter every minute.

763
01:05:12,486 --> 01:05:14,420
You leave my ass out of this!

764
01:05:14,488 --> 01:05:18,050
You don't say nothing
about my drinking or the gambling!

765
01:05:18,126 --> 01:05:20,151
You promised we'd eat there
and I want to go!

766
01:05:20,228 --> 01:05:24,062
So, you get out there right now,
this minute, and steal something.

767
01:05:24,132 --> 01:05:27,466
-It's gonna rain, Jewel.
-I don't give a shit about rain.

768
01:05:27,803 --> 01:05:31,535
I wanna go out on my birthday,
and you're gonna take me.

769
01:05:31,875 --> 01:05:33,638
Can you talk some sense into her?

770
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:36,144
No, I ain't about get into the middle of this.

771
01:05:36,213 --> 01:05:38,512
What are you waiting for?

772
01:05:38,816 --> 01:05:39,976
Move!

773
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,612
All right.

774
01:05:44,522 --> 01:05:46,616
If I take you to a restaurant...

775
01:05:46,859 --> 01:05:49,453
will you come and stay the night
in my room?

776
01:05:51,297 --> 01:05:53,289
Not in front of my boy.

777
01:05:54,034 --> 01:05:57,936
Not in front of your boy?
He's a grown man, for God's sake.

778
01:05:58,939 --> 01:06:02,239
Besides that, you've had him out
selling cock since he was 1 2.

779
01:06:02,310 --> 01:06:04,835
It ain't like we haven't known each other.

780
01:06:06,648 --> 01:06:10,482
I'll think about it.
But you gotta take me eating first.

781
01:06:12,487 --> 01:06:15,013
All right, but remember, you promised.

782
01:06:17,193 --> 01:06:19,889
-See you, Sonny.
-See you later, ranger.

783
01:06:27,706 --> 01:06:29,674
Why don't you just give him some pussy?

784
01:06:29,774 --> 01:06:32,402
Is that any way to talk
to your poor old Mama?

785
01:06:45,092 --> 01:06:47,083
Burn, baby, burn.

786
01:06:57,239 --> 01:06:59,764
Here's to Jewel Anne Phillips.

787
01:07:00,476 --> 01:07:03,378
The finest little lady
in the state of Louisiana.

788
01:07:07,751 --> 01:07:09,720
You're gonna make me cry.

789
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:22,658
Been a long time for us, ain't it?

790
01:07:25,905 --> 01:07:27,372
Nearly 30 years...

791
01:07:28,174 --> 01:07:30,905
if you count that little bit of time
we was together...

792
01:07:31,011 --> 01:07:32,740
when you was in the Army.

793
01:07:35,616 --> 01:07:36,742
That long?

794
01:07:41,456 --> 01:07:44,085
Don't you think we ought to tell him?

795
01:07:44,694 --> 01:07:47,094
No, absolutely not.

796
01:07:48,264 --> 01:07:50,961
And, if you ever do,
you'll never see me again.

797
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:53,600
I promise you.

798
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:01,604
You know you got the prettiest pussy.

799
01:08:10,222 --> 01:08:14,319
Excuse me, madam, but you have
to keep your shoes on in the restaurant.

800
01:08:14,461 --> 01:08:19,058
I always take my shoes off when I'm eating.
I've done that since I was a little girl.

801
01:08:19,366 --> 01:08:22,460
I'm sorry, but you're in violation
of the State Health Codes.

802
01:08:22,536 --> 01:08:26,029
If you won't put your shoes on,
I'll have to ask you to leave.

803
01:08:26,775 --> 01:08:30,734
But the state ain't gonna know
I took my shoes off.

804
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:32,880
I'm sorry, madam...

805
01:08:32,949 --> 01:08:36,112
but if you're trying to accustom yourself
to eating indoors...

806
01:08:36,285 --> 01:08:38,583
using silverware and plates...

807
01:08:38,888 --> 01:08:42,086
then you're going to have to learn
to wear shoes.

808
01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:48,529
Very well, then. I'll get your coat.

809
01:08:55,274 --> 01:08:57,504
You listen to me, mister.

810
01:08:58,010 --> 01:09:01,742
We ain't very sophisticated.
We don't come in these places very often.

811
01:09:02,516 --> 01:09:06,316
But you just insulted my woman,
in front of me, on her birthday.

812
01:09:06,553 --> 01:09:10,251
You're gonna trot back out there,
and you're gonna apologize to her.

813
01:09:10,391 --> 01:09:13,189
If you don't, or if you call the fucking cops...

814
01:09:13,261 --> 01:09:15,730
or your bouncer has us thrown out of here...

815
01:09:15,798 --> 01:09:18,665
then I'm gonna be forced to stick a knife
in your gut...

816
01:09:18,734 --> 01:09:21,704
on your way home from work.
Am I coming through?

817
01:09:22,872 --> 01:09:25,432
Of course, Mr. Wade, whatever you say, sir.

818
01:09:26,609 --> 01:09:29,078
And the shoes stay right where they are.

819
01:09:29,847 --> 01:09:32,975
Remember, your health is in the balance.

820
01:09:48,134 --> 01:09:51,002
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

821
01:09:59,781 --> 01:10:03,114
Sonny, I was beginning to think
you weren't coming.

822
01:10:03,318 --> 01:10:06,550
This must be Carol.
Sonny's told me about you.

823
01:10:07,389 --> 01:10:08,981
Welcome to the party.

824
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,460
Let me show you around.

825
01:10:15,899 --> 01:10:18,960
I want you to meet Scott.
I know he's here somewhere.

826
01:10:20,805 --> 01:10:23,774
-You really have a very nice home.
-Oh, yes.

827
01:10:23,841 --> 01:10:26,106
We just had it redecorated last year.

828
01:10:26,278 --> 01:10:29,475
You should've seen it before.
It was really getting to be a mess.

829
01:10:29,548 --> 01:10:31,140
There he is.

830
01:10:34,888 --> 01:10:39,622
I want you to meet Sonny and Carol.
This is the couple I was telling you about.

831
01:10:44,331 --> 01:10:48,200
-You real nice.
-Scott, must you be so vulgar?

832
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:51,339
They've only just arrived
and already you're leering.

833
01:10:52,742 --> 01:10:55,233
-Sorry.
-It's quite all right.

834
01:10:55,511 --> 01:10:57,570
We'll have plenty of time to get acquainted.

835
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:00,149
Come on, Sonny, let me show you around.

836
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,963
I'll see you next weekend.

837
01:11:17,036 --> 01:11:19,129
-Thank you.
-Good night, Catherine.

838
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:53,904
Nice party.

839
01:11:54,878 --> 01:11:57,677
Yes, a necessary evil.

840
01:12:01,386 --> 01:12:03,378
Did you enjoy yourself?

841
01:12:07,226 --> 01:12:08,488
It was great.

842
01:12:21,876 --> 01:12:23,868
I don't know what happens next.

843
01:12:25,748 --> 01:12:27,943
You wanna get serious, or what?

844
01:12:29,485 --> 01:12:31,351
Sonny, please.

845
01:12:34,324 --> 01:12:35,723
What do you want?

846
01:12:36,393 --> 01:12:38,157
I didn't mean to....

847
01:12:38,863 --> 01:12:39,955
I mean....

848
01:12:40,031 --> 01:12:41,931
I don't know what I mean.

849
01:12:45,904 --> 01:12:47,394
What are you gonna do?

850
01:12:47,472 --> 01:12:49,804
I'm gonna fuck your brains out, lady.

851
01:12:51,878 --> 01:12:54,847
I'm sorry. It's the beast in me.

852
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:17,230
That feel good, Daddy?

853
01:13:17,473 --> 01:13:19,874
That's it. Give it to me, baby.

854
01:13:22,512 --> 01:13:24,639
-Like that?
-Oh, yes!

855
01:13:25,282 --> 01:13:26,443
Faster!

856
01:13:28,986 --> 01:13:31,853
Gee whiz! That's it, baby!

857
01:13:45,271 --> 01:13:46,830
That's it, baby!

858
01:13:56,651 --> 01:13:59,313
-$500, right?
-That's the price, baby.

859
01:14:00,589 --> 01:14:02,558
We'll find our own way out.

860
01:14:02,892 --> 01:14:04,416
Mommy!

861
01:14:06,929 --> 01:14:08,056
Good night.

862
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,504
All right, come on. Let's run for it.

863
01:14:22,114 --> 01:14:23,240
Come on!

864
01:14:45,007 --> 01:14:47,373
That was a real winner we got in there.

865
01:14:52,849 --> 01:14:54,544
"Gee whiz, baby.

866
01:14:55,718 --> 01:14:57,118
"You're the best."

867
01:14:59,523 --> 01:15:00,990
He wasn't like that!

868
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,628
Let's go for a drive.

869
01:15:11,571 --> 01:15:14,665
-Yeah? Aren't you tired?
-No, are you?

870
01:15:17,243 --> 01:15:19,872
-Not really.
-Let's go for a drive then.

871
01:15:21,315 --> 01:15:23,579
-Where to?
-Anywhere.

872
01:15:24,451 --> 01:15:27,444
The country.
Let's go for a ride in the country.

873
01:15:29,123 --> 01:15:31,353
-ln the rain?
-Sure.

874
01:15:31,961 --> 01:15:34,862
-At least there won't be much traffic.
-All right.

875
01:15:44,641 --> 01:15:45,904
Come on.

876
01:15:48,312 --> 01:15:50,439
You said you wanna
walk around in the mud.

877
01:15:50,514 --> 01:15:53,040
I never said anything
about getting in with you.

878
01:15:53,151 --> 01:15:55,346
I don't wanna walk alone.

879
01:15:55,487 --> 01:15:56,954
I'll tell you what.

880
01:15:57,022 --> 01:16:00,891
Walk around the car a few times, you'll
never notice I'm not walking with you.

881
01:16:00,994 --> 01:16:02,393
Come on!

882
01:16:03,596 --> 01:16:07,624
I ain't getting out there, when I know
it's gonna start raining again any second.

883
01:16:07,701 --> 01:16:09,191
This is a $600 suit.

884
01:16:10,504 --> 01:16:13,440
I'll compromise with you.
We can keep the windows down.

885
01:16:13,508 --> 01:16:15,305
We can talk while you walk.

886
01:16:36,534 --> 01:16:38,024
Do I make you happy?

887
01:16:39,737 --> 01:16:40,897
Yeah, sure.

888
01:16:41,807 --> 01:16:43,468
No, I mean really happy.

889
01:16:45,511 --> 01:16:46,739
What's "happy"?

890
01:16:48,982 --> 01:16:51,917
Why don't you tell me
what it is that makes me happy.

891
01:16:51,985 --> 01:16:54,886
I'll tell you whether or not
you're giving it to me.

892
01:16:55,790 --> 01:16:56,950
I love you.

893
01:17:01,562 --> 01:17:02,791
Shit!

894
01:17:03,598 --> 01:17:05,725
-Get under the tree.
-Here it comes.

895
01:17:06,268 --> 01:17:07,599
Get under there.

896
01:17:17,014 --> 01:17:18,276
Sonny, look.

897
01:17:19,416 --> 01:17:21,509
-So?
-Let's go over there.

898
01:17:22,052 --> 01:17:23,577
No, we'll get soaked.

899
01:17:24,656 --> 01:17:27,750
I promise to keep you occupied
while our clothes dry.

900
01:17:31,197 --> 01:17:33,427
God help me for being so weak.

901
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,092
All right.

902
01:17:37,104 --> 01:17:39,231
We'll run for it. You ready?

903
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:41,707
All right, come on.

904
01:17:53,756 --> 01:17:55,155
What's that sound?

905
01:17:55,824 --> 01:17:58,123
I don't know. A cat maybe.

906
01:18:10,808 --> 01:18:13,676
Look, she must've just had them.

907
01:18:25,124 --> 01:18:27,593
Carol, dogs get born every day.

908
01:18:30,431 --> 01:18:31,728
I know.

909
01:18:33,368 --> 01:18:34,596
It's just....

910
01:18:36,304 --> 01:18:37,566
Fuck it.

911
01:18:38,807 --> 01:18:40,742
Christ, Carol, it's just dogs.

912
01:18:44,613 --> 01:18:46,274
It's not the dogs, is it?

913
01:18:46,849 --> 01:18:48,681
Don't tease me, Sonny.

914
01:18:49,386 --> 01:18:50,717
I'm human.

915
01:18:51,154 --> 01:18:53,088
I'm just like any other woman.

916
01:18:53,824 --> 01:18:57,124
Sometimes you act like a trick.
You think we don't have any feelings.

917
01:18:57,195 --> 01:18:58,526
I didn't mean it.

918
01:19:05,003 --> 01:19:06,595
Here, let me see that.

919
01:19:06,738 --> 01:19:08,036
Don't touch me!

920
01:19:12,278 --> 01:19:14,473
Carol, you're not even being practical.

921
01:19:14,882 --> 01:19:17,578
What the hell
does practical have to do with it?

922
01:19:18,419 --> 01:19:21,821
You tell me one thing that's practical
about our lives anyway.

923
01:19:22,157 --> 01:19:23,647
That's exactly my point.

924
01:19:23,758 --> 01:19:27,125
No, our point is that
I don't have the right to have a baby.

925
01:19:27,329 --> 01:19:31,027
It's not practical for a whore
to do anything but lay down.

926
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,925
I don't want to do this all my life.

927
01:19:34,871 --> 01:19:38,399
What the hell am I working for
if I can't have a future?

928
01:19:38,709 --> 01:19:40,609
Carol, look at me.

929
01:19:42,646 --> 01:19:44,979
Look at me. What do you see?

930
01:19:47,252 --> 01:19:50,814
Don't you know Jewel wanted
the same thing you want right now?

931
01:19:51,590 --> 01:19:54,889
-Don't you see the insanity of it?
-Don't play me, man.

932
01:19:55,761 --> 01:19:59,721
Jewel didn't want you. You were
a fucking accident and you know it.

933
01:20:11,146 --> 01:20:12,875
I'm sorry, baby.

934
01:20:14,483 --> 01:20:17,213
I didn't mean that. I'm sorry.

935
01:20:22,258 --> 01:20:23,225
Come on.

936
01:20:27,431 --> 01:20:29,228
Let's get out of the rain.

937
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:33,132
Sonny, why don't we square up?
We can get married.

938
01:20:33,505 --> 01:20:35,996
Everybody else seems pretty
up and doing it.

939
01:20:38,578 --> 01:20:41,479
We can't just pretend
we're like other people. We're not.

940
01:20:41,614 --> 01:20:43,206
Then lie to me!

941
01:20:43,783 --> 01:20:46,548
It's what we've been doing all our lives,
anyway.

942
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:49,646
No matter what we do to stop it,
we just get better.

943
01:20:49,957 --> 01:20:51,857
Why couldn't we just pretend?

944
01:20:52,225 --> 01:20:55,195
I could make myself believe it. I could, baby.

945
01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:58,899
How are we going to know
what honesty between two people means?

946
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,162
I don't care about honesty.

947
01:21:01,503 --> 01:21:04,233
I just want to be like everybody else.

948
01:21:15,786 --> 01:21:17,083
Let's go.

949
01:21:21,727 --> 01:21:24,992
Please, Sonny.
Tell me someday it's going to be different.

950
01:21:27,232 --> 01:21:30,669
Please, baby, tell me that one thing.
I need that.

951
01:21:31,437 --> 01:21:32,995
Please, baby, tell me.

952
01:21:45,887 --> 01:21:48,482
Come on. Let's go.

953
01:22:19,592 --> 01:22:21,890
I want to talk to you about something.

954
01:22:24,699 --> 01:22:26,064
Yeah, what is it?

955
01:22:27,735 --> 01:22:30,169
Troy asked me to marry him again.

956
01:22:32,441 --> 01:22:35,274
-So?
-I'm going to take him up on it.

957
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:38,547
Why?

958
01:22:39,816 --> 01:22:42,011
I feel like my life's passing me by.

959
01:22:42,652 --> 01:22:44,484
I've got make some kind of move.

960
01:22:46,356 --> 01:22:49,018
We just started working together.
Things will pick up.

961
01:22:49,093 --> 01:22:50,720
They never will, Sonny.

962
01:22:52,897 --> 01:22:56,094
All we're ever going to get is older,
and you know that.

963
01:22:59,472 --> 01:23:03,169
It's like you told me yesterday:
we can't change what we are.

964
01:23:04,610 --> 01:23:05,873
I want to try.

965
01:23:11,384 --> 01:23:13,114
I guess I can't stop you.

966
01:23:13,454 --> 01:23:15,979
We can leave this place, if you want to.

967
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:19,120
I'll come with you.

968
01:23:23,599 --> 01:23:25,794
Then I got to do what's best for me.

969
01:23:28,071 --> 01:23:29,538
Yeah, I understand.

970
01:23:32,342 --> 01:23:33,867
So no hard feelings?

971
01:23:34,311 --> 01:23:37,769
No. I understand what you're doing
and why you're doing it.

972
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:43,187
Baby.

973
01:23:58,639 --> 01:23:59,833
I have to go.

974
01:24:00,941 --> 01:24:02,842
Troy's taking me out to dinner.

975
01:24:03,444 --> 01:24:04,433
Have fun.

976
01:24:06,114 --> 01:24:07,342
I won't.

977
01:24:31,343 --> 01:24:32,640
Congratulations.

978
01:24:36,883 --> 01:24:38,350
I'll see you.

979
01:24:57,740 --> 01:24:59,537
Sure you want to play that?

980
01:25:03,713 --> 01:25:08,083
Gin! I beat you, you son of a bitch.
I beat your ass.

981
01:25:09,987 --> 01:25:11,615
Had to happen sometime.

982
01:25:12,223 --> 01:25:14,350
I won, God damn it.

983
01:25:14,726 --> 01:25:15,715
So what?

984
01:25:16,461 --> 01:25:18,794
I won. Don't you understand?

985
01:25:19,465 --> 01:25:22,400
Yeah, I understand. You won.
Now I have to close up.

986
01:25:22,935 --> 01:25:24,163
Late for dinner.

987
01:25:24,236 --> 01:25:26,296
I don't think you're getting it: I won.

988
01:25:26,406 --> 01:25:28,397
Henry, I get it. You won.

989
01:25:28,942 --> 01:25:30,739
It's been a long time, okay?

990
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:32,472
But we'll play again tomorrow.

991
01:25:32,546 --> 01:25:35,106
Aren't you forgetting something here?

992
01:25:35,917 --> 01:25:37,612
Triple schneider and $60.

993
01:25:40,122 --> 01:25:41,111
Swinging.

994
01:25:41,990 --> 01:25:43,389
You know, Henry...

995
01:25:44,192 --> 01:25:45,683
when you're right...

996
01:25:46,296 --> 01:25:47,456
you're right.

997
01:25:47,530 --> 01:25:49,555
When you're wrong, you're right.

998
01:25:50,033 --> 01:25:52,228
Tonight, you're right.

999
01:25:53,170 --> 01:25:54,194
$60.

1000
01:25:57,441 --> 01:25:59,136
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.

1001
01:25:59,209 --> 01:26:03,442
Going to win some of that money back
you've been taking from me all these years.

1002
01:26:03,515 --> 01:26:07,247
-That's good. But I still have to close up.
-Sure.

1003
01:26:08,020 --> 01:26:09,851
See you tomorrow, sucker.

1004
01:26:10,323 --> 01:26:12,382
You don't have to get personal about it.

1005
01:26:13,059 --> 01:26:14,789
I'm not getting personal.

1006
01:26:15,362 --> 01:26:17,853
Things are just turning around for me.

1007
01:26:18,231 --> 01:26:19,493
I can feel it.

1008
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,026
This is Henry's day, Albert.

1009
01:26:23,004 --> 01:26:25,029
I still have to close up.

1010
01:27:43,195 --> 01:27:44,823
You know, somehow...

1011
01:27:45,198 --> 01:27:47,962
I never seem to get myself ready for this.

1012
01:27:50,236 --> 01:27:51,829
Ain't nobody ever can.

1013
01:27:58,012 --> 01:28:01,449
Henry was a good man, Sonny.
I want you to know that.

1014
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:06,984
Yeah, I know he was, Mama.

1015
01:28:17,434 --> 01:28:19,095
He was your father.

1016
01:28:23,208 --> 01:28:24,197
What?

1017
01:28:24,909 --> 01:28:25,898
Henry...

1018
01:28:27,546 --> 01:28:29,241
was your father.

1019
01:28:34,287 --> 01:28:37,586
I first met Henry about 30 years ago.

1020
01:28:39,092 --> 01:28:40,788
I'd just been turned out.

1021
01:28:41,562 --> 01:28:44,122
Henry was in the Army, home on leave.

1022
01:28:46,634 --> 01:28:49,103
We set up a house down in Galveston.

1023
01:28:49,605 --> 01:28:52,506
And I tried to square up but it was hard.

1024
01:28:55,178 --> 01:28:56,907
I left him after a while...

1025
01:28:57,347 --> 01:28:59,577
when he got transferred up north.

1026
01:29:00,917 --> 01:29:01,907
Asshole.

1027
01:29:06,290 --> 01:29:07,985
Couple of weeks later...

1028
01:29:08,493 --> 01:29:10,290
I found out I was pregnant.

1029
01:29:14,966 --> 01:29:16,400
Ten years later...

1030
01:29:17,403 --> 01:29:19,234
Henry was passing through.

1031
01:29:19,805 --> 01:29:22,331
He looked me up
and that's when he found out.

1032
01:29:28,448 --> 01:29:30,781
Kind of hung around after that.

1033
01:29:34,923 --> 01:29:36,653
You didn't tell me, Mama.

1034
01:29:36,992 --> 01:29:38,687
He wouldn't let me, baby.

1035
01:29:40,796 --> 01:29:44,255
He didn't want you to know
that your father was a failure.

1036
01:29:57,583 --> 01:29:59,448
We're all failures, Mama.

1037
01:30:03,689 --> 01:30:06,591
That's easier to say than to live with.

1038
01:30:31,187 --> 01:30:33,019
Sonny baby, please....

1039
01:30:34,791 --> 01:30:36,918
You could've told me, Mama.

1040
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:40,931
Sonny? What do you want?

1041
01:32:41,002 --> 01:32:42,731
I want to talk to Acid Yellow.

1042
01:32:42,804 --> 01:32:44,066
Just a minute.

1043
01:32:58,088 --> 01:33:00,387
Acid Yellow says it's okay. Come on in.

1044
01:33:00,725 --> 01:33:03,717
That is, I'll sit here.
I'm looking out across yonder.

1045
01:33:03,828 --> 01:33:06,992
And I see those black boys over there
looking at my body.

1046
01:33:07,166 --> 01:33:10,431
My bosom's heaving out of my corset.

1047
01:33:10,536 --> 01:33:13,563
Pumping out of my corset,
and all I can think is:

1048
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:16,638
"They can't put a croak on it."

1049
01:33:18,077 --> 01:33:22,071
I'm watching those niggers and
they're watching my lily-white boobies....

1050
01:33:22,149 --> 01:33:24,583
Sonny, my God, sweetheart!

1051
01:33:24,652 --> 01:33:27,213
What're you doing here,
knocking on my door?

1052
01:33:27,522 --> 01:33:30,491
Mark, get Sonny here
something sweet to drink.

1053
01:33:31,159 --> 01:33:33,252
Oh, God, it's so good to see you....

1054
01:33:33,329 --> 01:33:35,923
Because Daddy's gonna suck Sonny's dick!

1055
01:33:40,904 --> 01:33:43,873
Excuse me,
I haven't been feeling well lately.

1056
01:33:44,641 --> 01:33:46,575
I think I got that new bug.

1057
01:33:47,745 --> 01:33:50,213
Boy, we certainly are delicious.

1058
01:33:51,182 --> 01:33:52,444
Can you give me a date?

1059
01:33:52,517 --> 01:33:56,079
Fuck me, man. You never worked me before.

1060
01:33:56,155 --> 01:33:58,623
I tried to get you to work me, but you....

1061
01:33:58,724 --> 01:33:59,782
Sit.

1062
01:34:00,226 --> 01:34:02,855
I want some rough trade.
I got a lot of energy.

1063
01:34:02,996 --> 01:34:05,556
Sure, honey, I can get you something...

1064
01:34:05,966 --> 01:34:08,731
but first, tell me why you switched
after all these years.

1065
01:34:08,803 --> 01:34:10,703
Can you give me a date or can't you?

1066
01:34:11,572 --> 01:34:14,097
-What are you going to do for me?
-Fuck you.

1067
01:34:20,716 --> 01:34:23,584
There is a gentleman
who'll be over in a few minutes.

1068
01:34:23,653 --> 01:34:25,814
John's one of Rick's steady tricks.

1069
01:34:26,122 --> 01:34:30,617
But I suppose I could let you have him.
Rick hasn't been feeling well lately, either.

1070
01:34:36,535 --> 01:34:38,400
I love coca!

1071
01:34:40,272 --> 01:34:42,103
Do you know what's expected of you?

1072
01:34:42,173 --> 01:34:44,802
Yeah, I know. Just show me the room.

1073
01:34:55,923 --> 01:34:57,323
Now look, Sonny...

1074
01:34:57,392 --> 01:35:00,418
John is a very prominent
insurance executive.

1075
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:02,223
A steady customer of mine.

1076
01:35:03,131 --> 01:35:06,067
You've got to be fun but kinky.

1077
01:35:06,635 --> 01:35:08,034
I know what to do.

1078
01:35:19,584 --> 01:35:20,812
Wait in here.

1079
01:35:21,586 --> 01:35:23,611
It'll probably just be a minute.

1080
01:35:26,358 --> 01:35:28,087
You sure you know what you're doing?

1081
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:30,321
Just shut up and get out of the room.

1082
01:35:30,896 --> 01:35:32,831
You do have some energy tonight.

1083
01:35:57,660 --> 01:35:58,627
Come in.

1084
01:36:15,147 --> 01:36:16,739
I've been a bad boy.

1085
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:22,217
I need to be...

1086
01:36:24,124 --> 01:36:25,421
punished.

1087
01:36:28,295 --> 01:36:30,763
How would you like your punishment?

1088
01:36:32,166 --> 01:36:34,134
In any manner that you see fit...

1089
01:36:34,669 --> 01:36:35,864
master.

1090
01:36:36,071 --> 01:36:38,596
Why do you feel like
you need to be punished?

1091
01:36:40,409 --> 01:36:41,501
Because...

1092
01:36:42,378 --> 01:36:44,812
I've been mean
to the people who work for me.

1093
01:36:44,881 --> 01:36:46,610
Did you know your father?

1094
01:36:48,484 --> 01:36:50,112
Why do you want to know that?

1095
01:36:50,187 --> 01:36:53,122
Just answer me, you fucking squid.
Did you know your father?

1096
01:36:53,190 --> 01:36:54,555
My father's dead.

1097
01:36:54,625 --> 01:36:55,718
So is mine.

1098
01:37:14,448 --> 01:37:16,644
-I'm sorry.
-It's not your fault.

1099
01:37:17,719 --> 01:37:19,209
It's not your fault.

1100
01:37:21,956 --> 01:37:23,082
Oh, my God!

1101
01:37:25,561 --> 01:37:26,653
I'm sorry.

1102
01:37:31,768 --> 01:37:34,635
You sorry motherfucker,
that was my best trick!

1103
01:37:34,704 --> 01:37:37,172
-Sorry.
-Shut up, bitch!

1104
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:38,503
Cut his face!

1105
01:37:38,609 --> 01:37:40,372
Cut his motherfucking face!

1106
01:37:48,487 --> 01:37:50,079
You fucking cunt!

1107
01:38:16,185 --> 01:38:17,652
How're you feeling?

1108
01:38:24,561 --> 01:38:26,051
I heard about Henry.

1109
01:38:27,698 --> 01:38:29,131
I'm sorry.

1110
01:38:36,975 --> 01:38:40,206
I just came by for a suitcase
and some of my things.

1111
01:38:41,214 --> 01:38:42,738
Troy's outside.

1112
01:38:44,117 --> 01:38:45,641
Came in a cab.

1113
01:38:47,788 --> 01:38:49,756
I got to take the Pontiac back.

1114
01:38:50,157 --> 01:38:52,853
We're driving it down to Mexico
to get married.

1115
01:39:06,008 --> 01:39:07,270
Where's Jewel?

1116
01:39:08,512 --> 01:39:09,809
In the kitchen.

1117
01:39:13,317 --> 01:39:14,978
You're going to be okay?

1118
01:40:58,136 --> 01:41:00,298
I need to talk to you, baby.

1119
01:41:01,374 --> 01:41:02,363
Sure.

1120
01:41:03,276 --> 01:41:04,607
Outside.

1121
01:41:06,145 --> 01:41:08,671
-Why?
-Because I don't want her to hear.

1122
01:41:08,916 --> 01:41:09,905
Come on.

1123
01:41:23,299 --> 01:41:24,596
Get out, Sonny.

1124
01:41:25,334 --> 01:41:28,327
-Get out of what?
-You've got to get away from here.

1125
01:41:28,438 --> 01:41:30,497
Right now, you've got to get away.

1126
01:41:30,807 --> 01:41:32,001
It's my life.

1127
01:41:32,442 --> 01:41:33,966
I chose it. I'll live it.

1128
01:41:34,144 --> 01:41:35,612
It's not your life.

1129
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:37,609
And you didn't choose it.

1130
01:41:37,715 --> 01:41:39,307
She chose it for you.

1131
01:41:39,917 --> 01:41:43,183
-And she'll drag you down with it.
-I can't leave her now.

1132
01:41:43,255 --> 01:41:45,849
-I'm taking care of her.
-Fuck her, man!

1133
01:41:46,892 --> 01:41:49,361
Think about yourself for a change.

1134
01:41:49,629 --> 01:41:53,156
She's always going to find girls
to work for her and you know it.

1135
01:42:00,875 --> 01:42:03,276
We could've made it, you and me.

1136
01:42:03,378 --> 01:42:06,040
It would've been tough,
but we could've made it.

1137
01:42:09,484 --> 01:42:11,578
Now you see what I got to settle for?

1138
01:42:12,021 --> 01:42:15,252
But I'm going to do it, man.
I'm going to quit now.

1139
01:42:15,525 --> 01:42:18,188
Right fucking now!
Even if it means with him.

1140
01:42:18,862 --> 01:42:21,524
You got to quit, too. Right now.

1141
01:42:22,199 --> 01:42:24,430
Don't even go back in the house.

1142
01:42:24,602 --> 01:42:25,728
Just run.

1143
01:42:30,575 --> 01:42:32,635
I'm taking my shot, Sonny.

1144
01:42:33,446 --> 01:42:34,913
I got to go.

1145
01:43:47,196 --> 01:43:49,461
Here, wipe your fucking face off.

1146
01:43:49,866 --> 01:43:52,391
You got mascara running all over the place.

1147
01:43:54,572 --> 01:43:56,005
I'm sorry, Daddy.

1148
01:44:11,658 --> 01:44:13,489
What the hell are you doing?
