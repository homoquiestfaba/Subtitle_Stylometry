1
00:00:20,301 --> 00:00:23,301
- A little green monster
grows inside of me

2
00:00:24,477 --> 00:00:27,197
He comes out to play when I wish
to look like she

3
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,500
I wanted her hair, her eyes,
her nose, her breast

4
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:35,968
I wanted to be inside her skin

5
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:38,967
A little green monster
grows inside of me

6
00:00:39,044 --> 00:00:42,794
It get stronger...and stronger
when I run away from me

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,841
and she used to be someone else

8
00:00:44,854 --> 00:00:47,254
I wanted her intelligence

9
00:00:47,373 --> 00:00:51,223
her speed, her heart, her soul

10
00:00:51,324 --> 00:00:54,724
I wanted to be admired
just like her

11
00:00:54,831 --> 00:00:58,131
A little green monster
grows inside of me

12
00:01:00,857 --> 00:01:02,607
- Look who is here? Dembe

13
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:06,358
Look at you? As you were before.

14
00:01:09,011 --> 00:01:10,361
- Yeah
- Good

15
00:01:11,023 --> 00:01:12,223
- You're going to the "masi"

16
00:01:13,355 --> 00:01:14,361
I walk with you

17
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,115
Did you tell your mother hello 
when I can

18
00:01:16,918 --> 00:01:18,218
- Are you going back?

19
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,452
I must show you

20
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:33,223
Barry. He is good to me.

21
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:41,097
So...how have you been giving along
since I've been away?

22
00:01:48,624 --> 00:01:49,724
Dembe

23
00:01:49,992 --> 00:01:51,192
Need a man up

24
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,745
Do you think that people mess with me?

25
00:01:54,626 --> 00:01:57,926
No, look at me! Look at me!

26
00:01:58,914 --> 00:02:01,114
People don't care I'm gay
cause I'm my own man

27
00:02:16,632 --> 00:02:18,132
Here, take this

28
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:24,392
I'm down hope here

29
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,091
- Dembe

30
00:02:40,552 --> 00:02:43,652
Oh, Ojore, oh my dear

31
00:02:43,674 --> 00:02:45,424
Look at you

32
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,407
That's a true man, young man.

33
00:02:48,407 --> 00:02:49,607
Look at him Dembe

34
00:02:50,772 --> 00:02:52,622
Omi, you must stay for dinner.

35
00:02:52,636 --> 00:02:56,436
- Eh...I'm sorry Namazzi, I cannot
I eat with my mother

36
00:02:56,714 --> 00:02:59,714
- Oh yes...
- I was walking Dembe home

37
00:03:00,443 --> 00:03:02,743
It was nice to catch him
- And where was he?

38
00:03:03,654 --> 00:03:05,254
You always come home
with so much sun

39
00:03:05,962 --> 00:03:08,662
Go and wash up. Now that you are
home we can have dinner

40
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,410
You must take this to your mother

41
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:15,519
- Oh...no, no Namazzi, I cannot.

42
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,300
Let me give you something.
- No, no!!

43
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,630
I wanted her intelligence

44
00:03:20,064 --> 00:03:22,684
her heart, her soul

45
00:03:23,127 --> 00:03:24,577
- Bye, Dembe

46
00:03:25,276 --> 00:03:26,276
- Bye

47
00:03:27,864 --> 00:03:28,864
Omi...

48
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:35,395
Thank you.

49
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,340
A little green monster
grows inside of me

50
00:03:40,343 --> 00:03:44,313
It get stronger and stronger
when I run away from me

51
00:03:44,326 --> 00:03:46,426
She used to be someone else

52
00:03:46,446 --> 00:03:48,546
I wanted her intelligence

53
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:51,558
her speed, her heart, her soul

54
00:03:52,764 --> 00:03:56,164
I wanted to be admired
just like her

55
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,720
A little green monster
grows inside of me

56
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,500
The promise is to expire
when I'll learn to smile in my reflexion

57
00:04:05,656 --> 00:04:08,656
even while rend the flesh of a man

58
00:04:09,179 --> 00:04:11,379
a woman cannot be herself

59
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:22,367
- Where do you go
when you're all in your head?

60
00:04:27,197 --> 00:04:28,397
What is this?

61
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:33,939
What did I tell you
about shrouding?

62
00:04:37,654 --> 00:04:40,354
- You can't tell them
- That's right. Now tell me

63
00:04:41,903 --> 00:04:43,003
- Poetry

64
00:04:44,655 --> 00:04:46,005
- Poetry about what?

65
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:51,035
- Everything that I am

66
00:04:52,329 --> 00:04:54,579
- Poetry is not what a man does, Dembe

67
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:56,922
I need you to be a man for me
and help

68
00:04:56,904 --> 00:04:58,854
- I don't want to

69
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:02,638
I don't want to be a man

70
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:05,733
- Don't you start with me today

71
00:05:06,299 --> 00:05:08,599
If you father was here
you will be gone all day

72
00:05:09,027 --> 00:05:11,027
and that's it,  there is so much to be done

73
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:16,614
Boy!
- I'm not a boy

74
00:05:19,425 --> 00:05:22,795
- You are not a boy?
But you're not a man.

75
00:05:22,942 --> 00:05:25,162
So what are you? Eh?

76
00:05:35,197 --> 00:05:36,347
- I am...

77
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:34,133
- I wanted her intelligence

78
00:06:34,692 --> 00:06:38,392
her speed, her heart, her soul

79
00:06:38,468 --> 00:06:41,938
I wanted to be just like her.
