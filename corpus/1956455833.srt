1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:04,771
Well, I have some very bad news
for the people in the front rows.

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,406
[audience chuckling]

3
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:10,010
I heard that some of you paid
as much as $800 for your tickets.

4
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:14,547
Sadly, I did this same show
a couple weeks ago in Atlanta...

5
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:17,751
for $60 a head. Can you imagine?

6
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:19,819
[laughter]

7
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:24,491
Nigga, you could have flown to Atlanta...

8
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,394
got a hotel, had some dinner,

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,497
and came back and you'd still have
a little money left over, niggas.

10
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:35,035
Paid way too much just to see me
in this gay-ass neighborhood.

11
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:41,141
All right, let me roll up my sleeves
and tell these pussy jokes.

12
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:43,576
[Dave chuckling]

13
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:46,746
Will told me to say there hasn't been
this many pussy references

14
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,581
in this room since <i>Cats</i> was here.

15
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,452
[somber piano music playing]

16
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:05,765
[Dave] <i>And when I think back at it,</i>
<i>this was probably the only time my life</i>

17
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:09,202
<i>that I ever thought to myself,</i>
<i>"I should kill everybody at school."</i>

18
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,870
[audience laughs]

19
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:12,539
<i>Thank you very much, New York.</i>

20
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:14,174
<i>-Good night.</i>
-[cheers and applause]

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,242
[cheering continues]

22
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,686
[cheers and applause]

23
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,366
Thank you, guys, very much.

24
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:44,571
Boy... I got to tell you, man.

25
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,007
I've been doing this set all week,
and boy, I'll be telling jokes

26
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:52,178
and sometimes niggas look like
they're in actual pain over the jokes.

27
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:54,280
Uh, one of it's that bad to me,

28
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:57,383
but I understand why I could hurt
some people's feelings, so tonight...

29
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,486
[whooping, cheering]

30
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:03,556
[Dave chuckles]

31
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:10,563
Tonight I'm going to give you
an opportunity that I rarely give anybody.

32
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,601
I'm going to let you say whatever it is
you need to say to my face.

33
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,605
Or ask me whatever it is you want to know,

34
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:21,541
but there are no dumb questions allowed.

35
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:24,410
If you ask a stupid question,
you'll be asked to leave.

36
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,446
-[audience laughs]
-Just kidding.

37
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:29,849
No, I'm just kidding, go ahead.
Everyone relax. Yes, sir, in the front.

38
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:32,919
Two questions: How often do you write?
And can I have a cigarette?

39
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,456
All right.
First, you may have a cigarette,

40
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,391
but remember,
this is not jail, motherfucker.

41
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,894
[laughter]

42
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,130
This lady right here.

43
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:47,133
I have a question.
Do you remember this scene?

44
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,602
Uh... [grunts]

45
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,471
[Dave] Oh, I do remember that.

46
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:54,641
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
That was a terrible question.

47
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:58,711
This gentleman in the front
with a salmon-colored shirt on.

48
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:02,448
I was wondering if you had any advice
for young comedians

49
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,117
that you generally give, and...?

50
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,186
Are you thinking of doing comedy?

51
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:07,620
Um...

52
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:11,758
I've never done it before, but
watching you has made me want to try it.

53
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:13,826
[audience laughing]

54
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,362
[scattered clapping]

55
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,532
[man] Bring him up!Â Bring him up!

56
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,636
-Bring him up!
-I don't know if that's an insult or not.

57
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,640
It's a-- It's a compliment. It's...

58
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,910
I mean, niggas don't say,
"I've never done brain surgery,

59
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:34,047
but it looks a lot easier than I thought."

60
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,615
[audience laughs]

61
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:36,616
I was...

62
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,851
I'm teasing.

63
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,720
All right, here would be my advice.

64
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:44,324
Okay, I don't know
how comedians start nowadays, right?

65
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,926
But what I would suggest is just start.

66
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:51,631
And, and, and... once you start,
you can't really stop, no matter...

67
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:55,501
what happens, no matter how bad it gets,
no matter what people say.

68
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,736
You know what I mean?

69
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,105
'Cause comedy is weird like that.

70
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:02,141
You know why I hate watching
other comedians do comedy?

71
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,778
Not 'cause I hate other comedians,
but because I love comedy so much.

72
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,615
It's like watching somebody else
fuck your girl.

73
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,283
[audience laughs]

74
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,418
And I say, "I fuck her better than that."

75
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,824
Yes, you on the aisle up there,
the lady with the long...

76
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,792
Yes, you, standing up, I see you.

77
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:23,496
-What's your favorite book of all time?
-[Dave] My favorite book of all time?

78
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:26,866
<i>The Narrative of the Life</i>
<i>of Frederick Douglass.</i>

79
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:27,967
[cheering]

80
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,670
[audience member whistling]

81
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:34,173
That guy-- That guy with the baseball hat.

82
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:39,712
Marry-fuck-kill: Michelle, Rihanna, Oprah?

83
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:43,049
Wait, who's Michelle?

84
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,918
-[man groans]
-Oh, Obama?

85
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,656
Well, sir, you're putting me
in quite the pickle. I can't...

86
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:53,159
I can't say I'll fuck Michelle Obama,
that's insane.

87
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,829
[exhales] Well, I guess... I...

88
00:04:57,563 --> 00:04:59,565
[audience laughs]

89
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,436
I mean, 'cause I wouldn't kill
any of those women.

90
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,638
But I'd fuck all three of them.

91
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,740
[laughter and applause]

92
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:14,814
Uh, the gentleman in the blue Oxford,
standing up.

93
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,683
Tell us a story with Charlie Murphy.

94
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:21,454
-Tell a story about Charlie Murphy?
-[man] Or your favorite.

95
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,123
Boy, there's so many
good Charlie Murphy...

96
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,261
The thing with Charlie Murphy is he used
to just make us laugh all the time.

97
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,431
And I used to ask him about all the old
Hollywood shit I was curious about,

98
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,966
like when they used to accuse
Michael Jackson, I remember asking,

99
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,168
I go, "Charlie, do you think

100
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,637
Michael Jackson
actually did those things?"

101
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,473
And he said, "Let me ask you a question,
Dave." He said...

102
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:44,043
He said, "Say it is illegal to fuck women.

103
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,713
How long are you staying out of jail?"

104
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:53,152
So God bless Charlie Murphy,
wherever you are, Charlie. I love him.

105
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,088
[cheers and applause]

106
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,892
Who do you think is going to win
the 2020 election?

107
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,562
[audience murmuring]

108
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,167
All right. I'm going to put a pin in this,
but I'll tell you right now, I don't know.

109
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:12,171
But I think Trump has a better shot
than a lot of people would like to think.

110
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:16,709
I'm just saying, it all depends
on how the left talks.

111
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:21,080
The way we're talking is not going to win
the fucking ballgame.

112
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,617
Donald Trump's over on the right,
grabbing handfuls of pussy.

113
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,854
Joe Biden can't even smell hair over here,
fuck this side.

114
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,722
[audience exclaiming]

115
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,460
-All right, ma'am, go ahead.
-Thank you so much for this show and...

116
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,530
-[Dave] How old are you?
-[chuckles]

117
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:38,464
Twenty five.

118
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:39,732
-Twenty five?
-Yeah.

119
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,268
[exhales] Boy, don't let R. Kelly see you,
He gonna...

120
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,070
[audience laughing]

121
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:48,474
He's going to pee on you by accident.
"Oh, my bad. I thought she was 15."

122
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:50,543
"Yuck."

123
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,180
Um... [chuckles]

124
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,250
I'm totally joking. I'm sorry. [chuckles]

125
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:03,623
Um, my question is, um, is there anything
you've learned from another comedian

126
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:06,159
that you feel like
will stay with you for life?

127
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,928
I'll tell you what, miss,
that's a good question.

128
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:12,231
Uh, "Yes" is the short answer.

129
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:16,969
A longer version of it is this:
I was raised by comedians.

130
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:19,572
I started doing stand-up when I was 14.

131
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,808
The other day I went
to a comedian's funeral

132
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:25,144
and I realized as we was putting
this motherfucker in the ground,

133
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:30,416
that these people are at least
as influential to me as my family.

134
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,219
I rock with these niggas
till the wheel falls off.

135
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,122
We fight and we fuss,
and we get jealous of each other,

136
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,659
and we get mad at each other,
but my life wouldn't have been what it was

137
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:43,696
without each and every one of them.
And I consider them my family.

138
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,431
That's your answer.

139
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,500
[whooping and cheering]

140
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,770
[Dave] <i>My favorite Club in America...</i>

141
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:55,641
<i>is a club in San Francisco called</i>
<i>the Punch Line. It's a very small room.</i>

142
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,443
<i>It's a 200-seat room.</i>

143
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,178
<i>And...</i>

144
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:03,249
<i>I was working out the material</i>
<i>that was going to be the show tonight.</i>

145
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,552
I still hadn't figured out exactly
how to say what I wanted to say,

146
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:10,556
but I was doing pretty good.
And I was doing some "Me Too" jokes.

147
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:14,360
And a woman... stood up from the audience,
and she was crying.

148
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,296
-Clearly, it was a white woman.
-[audience laughs]

149
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:24,270
She says... She says to me,
she says, "You can't say that!"

150
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:28,074
It's a 200-seat room, a very small room,
I'm like, "What the fuck--?"

151
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,410
-Like, "Miss, are you okay? What are...?"
-She says, "You can't say that!"

152
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:34,313
I said, "Yes, I can, it's my show.
I'll say whatever the fuck I want."

153
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,182
The crowd was like, "Ooh!" Like this.

154
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,183
Um...

155
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,987
And then, she gets up from the table

156
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:44,657
and she starts making a big, like,
show, just pushing through the aisles

157
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,727
and all this stuff. And there's, like,
a curtain right before the front door

158
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:50,897
and she gets to the curtain,
and she's crying. This is fucking crazy.

159
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:53,799
She says, "I'm sorry I was raped."

160
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,904
It's a fucking comedy club.

161
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,007
That's like loud farting
getting out of an elevator.

162
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,508
[blows raspberry]

163
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,544
"Nothing funny can happen in here."

164
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,881
Now I'm trapped in a room
with this woman's fucking stink.

165
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,384
[audience chuckling]

166
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,289
And I say... I say, "Miss...

167
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:18,558
Miss...

168
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,226
it is not your fault...

169
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,061
that you were raped.

170
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,799
But it's not mine either. Ta-ta, bitch."
Like this...

171
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,868
[scattered laughter and clapping]

172
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:32,772
She storms out.
Now the room is very uncomfortable,

173
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,874
but I managed to get the crowd back.

174
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:37,276
But I'm, like, you know,
a little traumatized.

175
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,079
Same show...

176
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,916
there's a trans woman
sitting in the audience.

177
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,953
This is a true story,
this was like a few weeks ago.

178
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,055
I did six shows that weekend.

179
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,324
This trans woman came to four of them.

180
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,359
Calls herself Daphne.

181
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:57,930
Man, this chick Daphne was in there
cracking the fuck up

182
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:01,867
at everything I said about everybody.
It was amazing.

183
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,770
She was laughing.
And it was fun to watch her laugh.

184
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:07,907
You could tell she was letting go
of something that was heavy.

185
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,776
And she'd throw her head back
and she'd smile with all her teeth.

186
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,378
She was having a great time.

187
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,414
And the more fun she had, I felt bad.

188
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:19,085
'Cause I knew...
I had some trans jokes to unload.

189
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,153
[laughing]

190
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,691
And I thought to myself,
"Maybe I shouldn't say these jokes,

191
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,693
'cause I don't want to,
like, fuck her evening up.

192
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,296
She's having so much fun."
But then I thought to myself,

193
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:34,000
"Well, if I can't say in front of her,
should I say this shit at all?"

194
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:35,935
So I let her rip.

195
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,004
[laughing]

196
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:43,009
And to my surprise,
Daphne laughed harder at the trans jokes

197
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:46,746
than anybody in the room. In fact,
everybody in the room would look at her

198
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,214
to make sure it was okay.

199
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,850
-[audience laughing
-[scattered clapping]

200
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,586
And...

201
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,190
I got off stage, in the dressing room,
like, "That was a fucking weird show."

202
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:01,293
I'm sitting in the dressing room,
by myself, trying to figure out, like,

203
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,629
"What the fuck just happened out there?"

204
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:06,999
Like, "Why is it that this one woman
can't take any of these jokes

205
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:10,536
and Daphne can take
all of these jokes? So weird."

206
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:14,373
And then I realized...
Ah! Daphne used to be a man.

207
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,442
[audience laughing]

208
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,511
[scattered clapping]

209
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,150
So, now, I go out of the dressing room
and, like, you can see, like,

210
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:26,819
all the staff was there,
like, cleaning the club up,

211
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,354
the audience had gone.

212
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,590
And sitting at the bar by herself...
was Daphne.

213
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:35,695
And she's like, "Hey, Dave,
come join me for a drink."

214
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,964
And I don't want her to think that
I'm transphobic, so I'm like, "Fuck it,

215
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,100
I guess I could have at least a drink."

216
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,369
And we get some tequila
and we're sitting there.

217
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:47,973
And she was fucking cool. Turns out
that Daphne, she wants to be a comedian.

218
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,643
She was asking me for advice,
I told her advice and all this shit.

219
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,344
And then she says to me, she says,

220
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:55,848
"Boy, you sure do get a bad rap
for your trans jokes."

221
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,884
I said "Daphne, thank you,
but you don't have to say that.

222
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:02,855
I hope I didn't offend you."
She goes, "No... No, no, no."

223
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:06,425
She said, "In fact, I read about you
in <i>The New York Times."</i> I said, "You did?"

224
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,061
She said, "Yeah.

225
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:12,364
I thought it was interesting
that they blamed you for R. Kelly.

226
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:15,367
They said you normalized him
for telling jokes about him."

227
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:16,902
I go, "Yeah, yeah, they said that."

228
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:20,706
She goes, "I wonder why they never said
that you normalized transgenders

229
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,575
by telling jokes about us."

230
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,977
-[whooping and cheering]
-[applause]

231
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,782
And I'd never thought about that,
it had never occurred to me.

232
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:33,152
And we started making out.
And then, like...

233
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,587
-[audience laughing]
-I...

234
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:38,057
I reached up just to see
what it felt like.

235
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,392
I was like, "Oh, what does...?"

236
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,628
And it felt like pussy, it did.
It was like...

237
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,231
Go ahead, ask me a question.

238
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,900
[man] What the fuck you gonna do
if Trump get re-elected?

239
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,935
[audience exclaiming]

240
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,171
Uh, what am I gonna do
if Trump get re-elected?

241
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,106
Probably get a significant tax break.

242
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,175
[audience laughs]

243
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:01,714
[Dave] Hey.

244
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,050
You want to know why I don't even talk
about Trump in my show?

245
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:07,953
Because that motherfucker
is not the Hokey Pokey.

246
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,755
He is not what it's all about.

247
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:14,560
There's millions of people
that put him in power.

248
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:19,799
And the ideas that he puts forth...
uh, are not his own.

249
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,903
He's singing
poor white people's greatest hits.

250
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:27,273
So why the fuck would I worry about him?

251
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,542
And not the other millions?

252
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,579
Really, know who
I'm gonna vote for next time,

253
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,582
if things keep going the way
it's going, is that gay dude.

254
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,852
-[audience member shouting indistinctly]
-No, Mike Pence.

255
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,855
[audience laughing and applauding]

256
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,057
[somber piano music playing]

257
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:48,794
[Dave] <i>Now, this is the same club,</i>
<i>the Punch Line, this is 15 years ago.</i>

258
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:53,432
<i>And I had just gotten back</i>
<i>from my infamous, uh, South Africa trip.</i>

259
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,101
<i>And I came to the Punch Line,</i>
<i>just to cheer myself up.</i>

260
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,571
It's a safe place
where I could tell some jokes.

261
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,407
And.... I find out that

262
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:04,977
this comedian I know, Chris Tucker,
who was in all those <i>Rush Hour</i> movies...

263
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:10,015
I find out that Chris is in San Francisco
too, at some charity event.

264
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,985
So I call him, like, "Yo, I just saw you
at some charity event."

265
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,622
I'm doing the show at the Punch Line.
Why don't you come by the club

266
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,024
-after your event?"
-He's like, "Cool, Dave.

267
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:22,161
I thought you was dead, nigga.
I'll come by." He said...

268
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,230
[audience laughing]

269
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:30,202
He says, "Is it okay if I bring some
friends 'cause I'm with a lot of people."

270
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:33,706
I go, "Man, you're Chris Tucker,
you can bring whoever the fuck you want."

271
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,709
And then I show up to the club...

272
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,310
late that night.

273
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:42,948
I walk into the dressing room,
and sitting in the dressing room...

274
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:47,653
is, uh, Gavin Newsom, who at the time
was the mayor of San Francisco,

275
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,222
but now he's the governor of California.

276
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,592
And sitting next to him was Kamala Harris,

277
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:56,328
who at the time
was the DA of San Francisco.

278
00:14:56,395 --> 00:15:00,933
Now she's a senator from California that's
front-running on the Democratic ticket.

279
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,701
[scattered cheers and clapping]

280
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,504
And sitting next to her was Al Gore.

281
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,208
That's fucking weird.

282
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:11,343
[audience laughs]

283
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,713
And sitting next to Al Gore
was the guys from Google, Sergey and...

284
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,882
-I don't know how to say these...
-[woman] Whoo!

285
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:17,816
All right.

286
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,385
[audience laughs]

287
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:22,221
And it was Chris Tucker and Ben Jealous,

288
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:25,090
who at the time was the president
of the NAACP,

289
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:28,661
who was all just
at this big charity dinner. And, and...

290
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,829
And Paul Mooney was drinking scotch.

291
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,564
[audience laughs]

292
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,434
And we all was just in there.

293
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,938
You know, at first, I was a little
uncomfortable. We start talking

294
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,673
and we all got along really well.

295
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,541
Mmm...

296
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:48,314
At some point, uh, Kamala Harris says...
she says to me, she goes,

297
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:52,985
"You know, a friend of mine is announcing
his candidacy for president tomorrow.

298
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,520
I went to college with him."

299
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,822
I'm like, "What the--?"
I go, "Barack Obama?"

300
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,457
She goes, "You've heard of him."

301
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,592
I'm like, "Yo, I just read
about this dude."

302
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:01,794
And she goes, "Yo, yeah..."

303
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,763
Blah, blah. We're talking.
She goes, "You know what? Let's--

304
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,899
Let's call him on the phone."

305
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,368
-I said, "What the fuck?"
-[audience laughs]

306
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,972
She picks the phone up and she dials,
and she's listening like this...

307
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:16,141
And she goes... "Ah..."
[clicks tongue]Â  "It's his voice mail."

308
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,711
And she gives me the phone
and goes, "Leave him a message."

309
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:21,981
I didn't know what to say.

310
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:25,517
I just said what you say to any black dude
that's running for president:

311
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:28,220
"Stay low, run in a zig-zag pattern,"
this kind of shit.

312
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:29,955
[audience laughing]

313
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,358
-[whistling]
-[clapping]

314
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,770
And then the last thing I say is...
You know what?

315
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,774
I said, "Sir, I really do believe you can
do this. Man, I'm wishing you luck."

316
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:49,808
Now...

317
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:53,612
Next day I wake up and go for coffee
at a place called The Embarcadero.

318
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,348
It's like an eatery
by the sea in San Francisco,

319
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,418
and I'm walking to the coffee shop
and there's a police line.

320
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:02,454
And I can't cross... the tape.

321
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,623
But I figure, "Ah, fuck it,
I'm Dave Chappelle"

322
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,192
-so I go under the thing, like this.
-[audience laughs]

323
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,094
And the police yoke me.

324
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,830
These motherfuckers, like,
tackle me immediately.

325
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:13,899
And I see...

326
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:17,169
over the police's shoulder, Gavin Newsom.

327
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:20,105
I couldn't remember his name,
but I remember the night before

328
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:23,208
I had kept teasing him and saying
he looked like Christian Bale,

329
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,044
the guy from the Batman movies.

330
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:29,515
Uh, so I see him and I can't remember
the name, so I'm like, "Batman, help."

331
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:31,450
[audience laughing]

332
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,556
And he stops, he's like, "Dave?"

333
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:40,959
And then the police see
that the mayor knows me.

334
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:43,362
So they're all like,
"Oh, sorry about that. Uh..."

335
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:44,930
And he's like, "Back up, everybody,"

336
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:47,232
He picks me up, like,
"I'm really sorry about that."

337
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,101
I'm like, "Ah, I'm fine.
Don't worry about it."

338
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,870
And he's like... he's like,
"Listen, I'm here with the prince.

339
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,138
Would you like to meet him?"

340
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,174
I'm like, "I know Prince,
that's my nigga."

341
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:00,045
And we go around the corner and it was
Prince Charles, the Prince of England.

342
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,114
[audience laughing]

343
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:06,852
I didn't know the protocol of meeting
royalty. You're not supposed to touch 'em.

344
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,755
I dapped him up like a nigga.
"My nigga."

345
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,390
-[audience laughing]
-[grunts]

346
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:15,060
I was hugging him and shit like this,
dapping him up. [grunting]

347
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,529
Like this. And that nigga was cool, too.

348
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,398
It was really fucking weird.

349
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:23,135
And then I was just out there
in the Upside Down,

350
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,737
not having no TV show,
trying to figure life out,

351
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:28,173
and the election was going on
in the background,

352
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,677
and this guy, Barack Obama,
was picking up steam.

353
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,012
This motherfucker was killing it.

354
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:39,151
And I had a chance to go to the last
debate on the Democratic ticket.

355
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,520
And I went. It was me and Chris Tucker,

356
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,956
sitting in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

357
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:46,859
It was the last three candidates.
It was Barack Obama,

358
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,194
John Edwards and Hillary Clinton.

359
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,830
Now, Obama is a lot taller
than Edwards and Clinton,

360
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:54,399
and he had the center podium.
And at one point,

361
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,602
they're all on stage
and they start fussing,

362
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:59,805
and then Obama goes, "Look,
none of us are perfect." Like this.

363
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:03,342
His hands was like this, and there was
a light shining behind his head,

364
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,611
and the other two candidates
was looking up at the nigga,

365
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:09,081
and I'm sitting in the audience, like,
"This nigga looks like Jesus."

366
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,549
[audience laughing]

367
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,618
[scattered clapping]

368
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:18,190
And I realized, in that moment...

369
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:22,661
that I was looking at the next president
of the United States. I was certain of it.

370
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,663
-I couldn't explain it.
-[people cheering]

371
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:28,500
But I knew what I was seeing.
And I got really excited.

372
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:31,637
And I'm not that kind of guy.
I said, "I gotta meet this motherfucker."

373
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:36,108
So I stayed. They were all on stage
doing interviews,

374
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,410
and I just waited.
I was waiting and waiting.

375
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,014
And then John Edwards was done
with his interviews first,

376
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,483
'cause everybody knew
he wasn't gonna win. Uh...

377
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,353
And I see John Edwards, and I said, "Hey,
Senator Edwards, I just wanted to say hi."

378
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,422
That motherfucker
looked at me like, "Mm-mmm."

379
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,358
I'm like, "Fuck you, nigga,
you gonna lose anyway."

380
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,228
And he left. And then
Hillary Clinton just walked by me

381
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:57,996
in one of them Steve Harvey suits.

382
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:00,065
[audience laughing]

383
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,134
[scattered clapping]

384
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,307
But Obama was taking forever.

385
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:11,009
Everybody wanted to talk to him,

386
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:14,313
and I knew the media saw
exactly what I saw.

387
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,248
There was no question about it.

388
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:19,184
That was the guy.

389
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:23,589
I waited and I waited and finally...
Must have been over an hour and a half.

390
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:24,923
He finishes his last interview.

391
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:29,161
He's like, "Thank you very much,
good talking to you." And he turns around,

392
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,296
and he-- We make eye contact.

393
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:34,666
He sees me. And when he sees me,
he looks over, he goes... [inhales]

394
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,236
"Dave Chappelle."

395
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,771
-[laughter and cheering]
-[scattered clapping]

396
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:43,642
And... And Obama did me
the same way I did Prince Charles.

397
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,310
He dapped me up... [grunts]

398
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,480
And he, like, bro-hugged me,
and he pulled me in.

399
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,716
I'll never forget this,
he said in my ear...

400
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,818
"I got your message."

401
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,086
[audience laughs]

402
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,255
Thank you very much, New York City.

403
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:57,322
Good night.

404
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,391
[cheers and applause]

405
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,936
[audience noise fades out]

406
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,005
[somber piano music playing]

407
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:43,028
[man] <i>By the way... vanglorious.Â </i>

408
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:46,164
<i>This is protected by the red...</i>

409
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:48,967
<i>the black and the green.</i>

410
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:52,304
<i>At the Crossroad, with a key.</i>

411
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,306
<i>Sissy.</i>
