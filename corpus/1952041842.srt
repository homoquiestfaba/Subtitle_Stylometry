00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:20,976
"The big old owl flapped his wings
and yawned.

1
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:23,748
It's much too late
and too many creatures about.

2
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:27,086
She will surely get a scary fright.

3
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,229
Where the alligators romp
and the frogs grow fat and orange...

4
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,331
...the field mouse sings
to the owl kings...

5
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:35,491
...with a voice
like a squeaky door hinge...

6
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:37,966
...there lived a girl
who's sunny sweet...

7
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:42,404
...and the children
call her Sticky Feet.

8
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:46,940
With almond eyes
and golden curls...

9
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:52,141
...she knew that swamps
are not for girls."

10
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:40,266
Claire, the dreams
are getting stronger.

11
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,235
All I'm saying, Claire,
is you gotta stop avoiding it.

12
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:50,678
It's time we started to really deal
with this. It's important.

13
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,247
Are you taking your medication?

14
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,452
Doesn't help.

15
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,060
It's evolving.

16
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:08,156
I'd like to try hypnosis, a change.
We're ready.

17
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:15,172
Is this a man-made problem...

18
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:18,208
...or possibly the result
of global warming?

19
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,347
Check into any inn or
bed-and-breakfast in Westmoreland...

20
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:25,075
...and you'll notice a serious decline
in hunters and birdwatchers alike.

21
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,310
But is it from their own doing?

22
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,614
The blue-winged warbler
hasn't been seen here...

23
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,723
...since last summer
in Westmoreland County.

24
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,916
Perhaps this once-flourishing...

25
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,231
- Claire?
- Mrs. O'Shea.

26
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:59,428
Mercy, and this is Heidi.

27
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,967
Welcome to Rose Marsh Farm.

28
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,814
We don't get too many guests
this time of year, so...

29
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:23,418
Here's your living room.

30
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:27,032
There's wood and kindling
over there.

31
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,427
Should keep you warm.

32
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,661
The fireplace is working.
It's pretty straightforward.

33
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:35,898
We get photographers
and birdwatchers in the summer.

34
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:40,334
So if you'll follow me,
I'll show you the upstairs.

35
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:46,149
- You're a writer?
- Yes.

36
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:51,217
Well, you'll have lots of peace
and quiet, and plenty of space.

37
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,358
I can guarantee you that.

38
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,123
This is the master bedroom.

39
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,994
There's extra linen in the closet.

40
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:06,604
And here's the studio.

41
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,704
The Manvilles and the Roses
settled the whole area.

42
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:53,411
We call him Old Mister.

43
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,888
And that's the marsh.

44
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,525
Yeah, I'd steer clear of that,
if I was you.

45
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,388
You can get lost in there
pretty quick.

46
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:06,088
If you need anything, I'm the first
house on the way into town.

47
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:58,935
"The big old owl flapped his wings
and yawned.

48
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,636
What is a girl doing
in a swamp at night?

49
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:04,783
It's much too late
and too many creatures about.

50
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,545
She will surely get a scary fright."

51
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,255
How do you make up your stories?

52
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:15,325
I start by asking the question,
"What if?"

53
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,341
- Oh, sorry.
- I'm sorry.

54
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,644
- I didn't see you.
- It's all right. I'm so sorry.

55
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,048
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

56
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,155
All right, well, good morning,

57
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:53,086
Good morning.

58
00:14:58,764 --> 00:14:59,992
Noah, Noah Pitney.

59
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:03,100
That's the great thing
about being from a small town...

60
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:07,103
...is you can introduce yourself
to anyone you bump into.

61
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,605
- Right, Ernie?
- That's right.

62
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,840
- Claire Holloway.
- Pleasure to meet you, Ms. Holloway.

63
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,208
Nineteen fifty, miss.

64
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:20,980
No, no, no, allow me, please.
This is country manners in action.

65
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,621
Ernie, I just want to remind you
there's a game tonight.

66
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:25,222
- Got it.
- I'll see you then.

67
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,651
Oh, and please, put this on my tab.

68
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,522
- This is for you.
- You don't have to do that.

69
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,725
No, please, take it.
I've already read it.

70
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:38,836
Help you get accustomed
to the town.

71
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,869
Editor's got some
pretty eccentric views...

72
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,372
...but, say, I bet he'd love
an interview with you.

73
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,371
- You really that short on tourists?
- Come on, Claire, I have three nieces.

74
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,673
"Star children's author
hits Westmoreland."

75
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,975
That's pretty big stuff around here.

76
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:53,584
I'm flattered.

77
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,353
But?

78
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,692
But I think I'm going to pass.

79
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,159
That's all right. I'll just have
to interview yet another bingo winner.

80
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,258
- You're the editor.
- I am, yeah.

81
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:08,900
Also the local historian.

82
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:11,002
Actually, I brought out
a book last year.

83
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,730
I only, you know,
only printed 250 copies, but...

84
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,674
- That's what my first one was.
- Really? So there's hope for me.

85
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,376
Okay.

86
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:23,571
Listen, if you need anything...

87
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:27,378
...my number's on the back of
the paper, if you wanna call me.

88
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,789
Bye.

89
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,557
What if?

90
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,831
What if, what if, what if, what?

91
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,732
I could get used to
this country living.

92
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:15,395
Yeah, well, I can...
I can appreciate that.

93
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:18,807
I remember there was a time
when I covered crime...

94
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:23,004
...for all the big dailies
all over the country.

95
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,247
How did you end up here?

96
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:32,089
It's weird. I always told myself
that I was never gonna come back.

97
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,452
And then the editor's job came up...

98
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:39,757
...and Philip Manville asked me
to do it and I said yes...

99
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:43,599
...and I guess it just felt right
to come back.

100
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,828
You know, I have my farm
and got a horse.

101
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:48,632
And it's good. It's a good life.

102
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,543
There. It's not perfect, but it'll work.

103
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:57,481
- You know Ernie well?
- All my life.

104
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:01,050
- He's always lived here?
- Yeah. Why?

105
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,456
I should go.

106
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,674
That's quite enough of you,
Sticky Feet.

107
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:16,016
Ernie, have we met before?

108
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:17,553
I don't think so.

109
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,558
They say the same face can turn up
on different people. Isn't that so?

110
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,496
Yeah, I guess so.

111
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,867
Enjoy your book.

112
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:36,501
Get back!

113
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:39,172
You forget something, Claire?

114
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,241
Did you forget something, miss?

115
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,848
No.

116
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,416
Hi.

117
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:12,620
Morning.

118
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,200
Good morning, Claire.

119
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:21,600
Good morning.

120
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:26,199
Was it the storm? You okay?

121
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:28,473
Yeah, I'm fine.

122
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:35,845
I bought your book.

123
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,080
So you're the one.

124
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,191
Fascinating history this place has.

125
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:49,596
Listen, you wanna find out more,
I'll take any excuse to skip church.

126
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,326
Please?

127
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:57,231
So the Manville School for Boys
closed its doors in the late 1800s...

128
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,673
...and the Westmoreland
Elementary School opened...

129
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,574
...at the beginning
of the last century.

130
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:05,375
How nice of the county
to invite the girls out to play.

131
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,245
From what I know
of the boys' school...

132
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:09,410
...the girls might have been
happier at home.

133
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:12,954
- Scary.
- Good fodder for a new book.

134
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,020
I just read The Swamp
to my niece...

135
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:19,561
...and I gotta tell you,
I found it quite creepy.

136
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:22,393
All the great children's books
are dark.

137
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:26,333
Brothers Grimm, Aesop,
Roald Dahl.

138
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:29,302
"Ring Around the Rosy"
was about dying from the plague.

139
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:34,537
Scary monsters in
the deep dark marsh. Oh, scary.

140
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,809
Fairy tales and nursery rhymes...

141
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:40,144
...tap into the primal, subconscious
fears of the young mind.

142
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:43,185
So you're saying that all kids
like to be creeped out.

143
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:45,117
Didn't you?

144
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,486
You ever hear any stories
about this place?

145
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,685
Like what, like creepy ones?

146
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:55,997
Creaking boards, slamming doors,
whistling winds...

147
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,468
You writers.

148
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,198
I'll tell you what.

149
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:03,363
I'll tell you everything that I know
over dinner tomorrow.

150
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,008
Platz! Platz! Platz!

151
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,680
Platz. Platz.

152
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:01,551
- Normally, he's a pussycat.
- Could have fooled me.

153
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:05,579
- Are you Geoffrey Hunt?
- Hunt.

154
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,351
- Everybody calls me Hunt.
- Claire Holloway.

155
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:11,984
He hasn't blown his top like that
in a long time, Claire.

156
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:14,393
Only one reason he does that.

157
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:17,033
Oh, yeah? What's that?

158
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:23,740
- He smells a ghost.
- What?

159
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:28,872
Think of it like vapors
from the other side.

160
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,308
I don't believe in ghosts.

161
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,979
Neither do I.

162
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,651
I'll follow you.

163
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:42,688
So this place, huh?

164
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,725
- You've been here before?
- Three years ago.

165
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,124
What was her name? Grace?

166
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,525
- Mercy.
- Yeah.

167
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:51,931
So you're a paranormal consultant
who doesn't believe in ghosts?

168
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,832
I believe in people.

169
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:56,166
I mean,
people are water and energy.

170
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:59,139
If water can transform from ice
into steam, into mist...

171
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:03,644
...and energy transforms them,
why can't people?

172
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:05,713
What happened with Mercy?

173
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:09,649
She got a little spooked, that's all.
Noises and such. Nothing major.

174
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,914
These kinds of energies
can be very particular.

175
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,923
They can reveal themselves
to one person and not to another one.

176
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:16,754
Why me?

177
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,787
You tell me, Claire.

178
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:25,759
He was in there?

179
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:34,970
Port.

180
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:38,942
Port?

181
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,517
It's the access point for them
to come in.

182
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,782
The computer's another good one.
I'd leave that off for now.

183
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,934
How long has this been here?

184
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,234
A couple of days. Why?

185
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:03,097
On the other side...

186
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:11,275
...doors can be both symbolic
and literal at the same time.

187
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:14,246
Taking one down...

188
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,982
...can be a way of stopping someone
from coming across.

189
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:24,126
So when you put the door
back up...

190
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:26,963
You're inviting them back in.

191
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:42,710
There's a definite increase in energy.
That's for sure.

192
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,440
- But why?
- People are weird.

193
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:48,744
They die, they get weirder.

194
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,418
Question is, why do you care?

195
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,451
Because I've seen...

196
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:57,594
I've seen that little girl before,
and not just in this house.

197
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,060
Do you have any idea
what you're dealing with?

198
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:03,723
It's a different world.
They don't play by your rules.

199
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:08,334
I lost my wife and my little girl
seven years ago.

200
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:12,532
I went looking for answers.
I never found them.

201
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,040
So you need to think about that...

202
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:17,647
...before you go looking for answers
on the other side.

203
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:21,842
You wanna be amongst the living,
trust me.

204
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,820
There's a motel in town.

205
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:31,560
If I were you, I'd check in to it.

206
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:33,728
Why make this your battle?

207
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:38,260
My father used to say, "Hunt"...
He called me Hunt.

208
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:41,829
He could be rather impersonal,
my father.

209
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:48,495
He'd say, "Hunt, you can dodge the
draft, you can cheat on your taxes...

210
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:51,801
...but never desert
a damsel in distress."

211
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,677
Let's get this party started.

212
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:17,499
What do they want from me?

213
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:20,500
Don't know.

214
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:22,801
But one thing's for sure.

215
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,007
It's you that they want it from.

216
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:29,640
Can you imagine?

217
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,211
Can you imagine,
if Mercy had seen what you seen...

218
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:36,012
...she'd be living in another country
under an assumed name.

219
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:40,351
Can you stand there for a second?
Just for a second, please. Thank you.

220
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:45,788
You are very photogenic.

221
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:55,665
I hope you can see them too.

222
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:58,134
Unless they're camera-shy...

223
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:00,270
...we'll get them.

224
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,915
So where did you grow up?

225
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:08,948
All over.

226
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:16,853
Oh, you're a military brat, huh?

227
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:19,526
- No.
- Little sip.

228
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,658
No, my parents were teachers.

229
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,694
Where they from originally?

230
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:34,173
Well, they weren't my birth parents.

231
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:40,339
Well, how old were you
when you were adopted?

232
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,487
- Eight.
- Eight?

233
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:51,852
I bet you were a pretty little girl,
weren't you?

234
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:55,897
Don't lie.
You were a cute one, weren't you?

235
00:38:57,301 --> 00:38:59,394
Unless you just sprouted up
all of a sudden...

236
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,595
...and became just
what you are right now.

237
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:09,713
My parents were killed
in a car accident.

238
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:13,910
I see.

239
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:19,019
You expecting someone?

240
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,387
- Hey.
- Noah, I'm sorry.

241
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:29,329
- I should have called you.
- Why? What happened?

242
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:33,835
Hunt, Noah.

243
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:35,494
Hunt's been helping me.

244
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:37,937
- How's it going, Pitney?
- Hello.

245
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:42,968
Let me guess.

246
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:47,777
This has to do with those
creepy things you were talking about.

247
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:53,014
I'm gonna go
and get some logs for our fire.

248
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:02,498
Sorry about dinner.
Maybe we can do it another night?

249
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,027
You know what I can do is
I could stick around...

250
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:08,433
...and help you with this séance
or whatever.

251
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,471
We don't need any help.

252
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,775
Okay.

253
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:19,011
I was looking forward
to having dinner.

254
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:21,651
Me too, but it's okay.

255
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,318
You know, we can do it
another time, right?

256
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,222
Good luck, good luck with this.

257
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:31,853
- I'll see you around.
- Later.

258
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:14,459
Hunt. Hunt.

259
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:23,001
Hunt!

260
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:51,285
Who are you?

261
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,863
Can you tell me your name?

262
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,335
Can you tell me something?

263
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:55,548
Just ask me nicely.

264
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:57,888
Why are you doing this shit?

265
00:44:58,062 --> 00:45:01,088
You're fucking me up!
Stick it up your fucking ass!

266
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:11,666
Please. Just ask me nicely, please.

267
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:15,442
I asked you nicely 10 minutes ago.
I'll tear this house apart...

268
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:18,479
...and when I find it,
you're gonna be one sorry fucking kid!

269
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:25,248
Go away!

270
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:38,032
Help me! Help me, Claire!

271
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:41,295
- Claire, no.
- No!

272
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:42,496
No! God!

273
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:06,486
- Who are they?
- Denman and Maude Rose.

274
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:07,891
From the farm?

275
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:12,661
I spent the evening doing a little
research and dug a little deeper.

276
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:16,203
I gotta tell you, this story's amazing.

277
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:21,704
So the Rose family got it into their
heads to drain the marsh in 1902.

278
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:23,938
Denman was doing
a lot of the work himself.

279
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:27,413
The little girl is his sister.
She was 8 years old.

280
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:31,179
One day, he's working, Maude goes
into the marsh to bring him lunch...

281
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:35,883
...but she falls into the bog
and drowns.

282
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:37,421
- God.
- Yeah.

283
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:40,324
And then, I think
Denman must have lost his mind.

284
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:43,193
He went after her, searching.
He never came out of the marsh.

285
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:46,029
Some of the locals went in
and they disappeared.

286
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:48,194
And then, well,
you know how a small town is.

287
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:51,773
All of sudden, everyone thinks that
this marsh is, you know, hexed.

288
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:55,303
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I wanted to tell you.

289
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:58,642
I just...
I never got the chance, remember?

290
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,947
Besides, I gotta tell you...

291
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:04,212
...I didn't think you were the type
to believe in this kind of stuff.

292
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:05,412
What type is that?

293
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:09,518
I'm sorry. I should have told you.

294
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:12,753
People have been talking about
that house and that marsh for years...

295
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:17,663
...and I just always sort of,
you know, I laughed it off, so...

296
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:21,968
- Don't patronize me, Noah.
- No, I wouldn't dare.

297
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:24,699
Listen, Claire, I can ask around.

298
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:28,777
I bet you I can find you a place
just as nice, if you wanted.

299
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,706
No. Thank you.

300
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:57,234
Hello?

301
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,321
Oh, God. What?

302
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:27,360
No.

303
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:14,099
No!

304
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:31,056
Feels like it was my fault.

305
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:36,930
Whatever's going on here,
you couldn't have stopped it.

306
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:40,500
But you are part of it, somehow.

307
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:42,802
If you want to make it stop...

308
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:46,340
...you have to figure out
how it started in the first place.

309
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,439
How?

310
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:53,145
Take a look at this.

311
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:01,487
You know, in a way, you're lucky.

312
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:14,594
Generally speaking, these cases
involve a voice in the attic...

313
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:19,174
...a peevish little spirit who's in need
of a little bit of hand-holding.

314
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:23,272
This...

315
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:32,750
This is epic.

316
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,519
Got it.

317
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:15,864
June 19th is missing.

318
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:21,404
Oh, look.

319
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:29,668
- Isn't that your editor friend?
- Yeah, with Mercy and Ernie.

320
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,382
"Local girl sexually assaulted.

321
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:38,920
Since the victim is a minor, her name
has been withheld by the police."

322
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:45,058
That's him. My God, that's him.

323
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:48,260
Brendan Manville.

324
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:54,865
Oh, look.

325
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:06,712
I spent the evening
doing some research.

326
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:11,320
The Rose family got it into their heads
to drain the marsh in 1902.

327
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:13,479
Denman was doing
a lot of the work himself.

328
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:17,787
The sister falls into the bog
and drowns.

329
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:20,725
Son of a bitch.

330
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:26,058
I'd say your friend's been
messing around with history.

331
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:28,767
Why would he do this?

332
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:33,004
Should ask Pitney.

333
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:34,404
Ask me what?

334
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:40,878
Any additional archival stuff
on the Rose family story...

335
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,918
...would be over there in microfiche.

336
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:49,124
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
I didn't know you were here.

337
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,843
Where did this come from?

338
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:18,844
I've seen him at the house, Mercy.

339
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:23,450
He moved away from here
20 years ago.

340
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:26,714
And the little girl? You've seen her too.
That's why you called Hunt.

341
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:29,757
Don't know what you're talking about.
I heard noises, that's all.

342
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:31,587
What do you know about this,
Mercy?

343
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:39,796
What the hell you asking me for?
What is it that you want?

344
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:44,533
- My friend just killed himself.
- He didn't kill himself, Mercy.

345
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:47,868
Those voices that you heard...

346
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:51,346
...what Claire's been seeing,
Ernie's death...

347
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:53,641
...it's all connected, Mercy.
It's all connected.

348
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:55,182
Stop it!

349
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,158
What are you doing?

350
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:06,022
You know who she is.

351
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:08,824
Tell me.

352
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:12,832
You tell me.

353
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:18,671
I got work to do.

354
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,912
You've gotta remember something.
Think, think.

355
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,309
What do you remember from
before your accident?

356
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:31,078
What's that have to do
with anything?

357
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:35,452
Because I think
that our little girl, that's you.

358
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:37,656
It's you, Claire.

359
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:45,491
I mean,
if you can accept that the soul...

360
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:50,367
...or the essence of someone,
that's energy...

361
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:53,475
...but in the case of
a severe trauma...

362
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:57,442
...some of that energy can be
torn from the body...

363
00:56:57,781 --> 00:57:01,945
...and it leaves an imprint.

364
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:08,487
That impression just replays over and
over and over again, like a videotape.

365
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:10,153
What kind of trauma?

366
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:15,522
We're talking about sexual assault,
Claire.

367
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:22,337
No, Hunt.

368
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:26,305
Think about it. Everything around
here, everything's familiar to you.

369
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:28,239
And this is not a dream...

370
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:32,279
...this is not a piece of fiction
from one of your books, no.

371
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,383
This is...

372
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:38,012
I think they're memories.

373
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,388
They're your memories, Claire.

374
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:46,685
Let's just burn the place down.

375
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,369
Never burn.

376
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:59,033
Never burn.

377
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:21,461
Hey, whoa!

378
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:30,103
Heidi, girl. Heidi, easy.

379
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:36,034
Easy, girl.
That's okay, Heidi, that's okay.

380
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,242
Heidi.

381
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,699
Heidi.

382
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:45,040
Hello?

383
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:17,969
Hello?

384
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:37,930
Hello!

385
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:13,926
Heidi?

386
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:20,698
No! No!

387
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:35,752
No! No!

388
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:04,108
No!

389
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:05,673
I got beer in my mouth.

390
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:10,251
You're not supposed to be here, kid.

391
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:30,498
Ready or not, here I come.

392
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:47,751
You okay?

393
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,988
Don't worry,
I know how to get him.

394
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:54,923
Gonna need to get something
that he'll recognize.

395
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:58,492
An article of clothing,
something from his life.

396
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:01,092
The more personal, the better.

397
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:04,535
If we can use that,
we can trap him again.

398
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:09,611
I think if I can get rid of him,
then I could I free her...

399
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:11,371
...free you.

400
01:04:13,316 --> 01:04:14,783
Make the next left.

401
01:04:37,673 --> 01:04:41,268
- Yes?
- Mr. Manville, I'm Claire Holloway.

402
01:04:41,444 --> 01:04:44,345
I know. If it's about the farm,
Mercy handles that sort of thing.

403
01:04:44,513 --> 01:04:49,610
No. It's about your son, Brendan.

404
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:02,787
What happened at the house?

405
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:10,163
Why is it, do you suppose,
that some people feel...

406
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:14,935
...they have the right to walk
into a complete stranger's home...

407
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:17,078
...and dig and scratch around
in their past?

408
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:24,282
You've been talking to Mercy,
haven't you?

409
01:05:24,453 --> 01:05:27,354
That goddamn woman is a drunk.

410
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:31,454
She sees the whole world
through the bottom of a bottle.

411
01:05:39,802 --> 01:05:42,270
Your dad's not gonna care.

412
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:44,934
What you got there?

413
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:49,200
That's my dad's, so...

414
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:51,739
Hey, don't point that thing at me.

415
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:54,212
Be careful.
Give it back to me, okay?

416
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:56,408
Hey, give it to me.

417
01:05:58,521 --> 01:06:01,649
Hey, sit down. It's okay.

418
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:08,624
- Let's do this.
- Thanks for coming.

419
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:11,492
Thanks for having us.

420
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:13,225
One, two, three.

421
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:19,199
Nobody came in or out.
It was abandoned.

422
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:23,573
It sat there empty like a tomb
for 20 years.

423
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:42,327
Look, if you don't like the house,
why don't you just leave?

424
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,193
What about the little girl?

425
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:46,863
No, that was a lie.

426
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:50,169
No. Brendan was with a little girl.

427
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:55,001
There was no proof.
That was a goddamn lie.

428
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,543
What happened to your son,
Mr. Manville?

429
01:06:57,947 --> 01:06:59,972
What are you talking about?

430
01:07:00,649 --> 01:07:02,742
What was wrong with him?

431
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:05,079
And why was he alone...

432
01:07:05,721 --> 01:07:07,882
...with a little girl?

433
01:07:13,396 --> 01:07:14,920
I've seen him.

434
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:17,995
In the house.

435
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:22,999
I need something of his,
something that was very special.

436
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:25,201
It's important
and I need it right now.

437
01:07:28,244 --> 01:07:30,804
What the hell happened in there?

438
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:35,873
Why won't you tell me?
What did he do?

439
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:39,047
Did he hurt her?

440
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:44,687
Did you hurt him?

441
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:47,919
What did you do to your son,
Mr. Manville?

442
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:52,200
Nothing.

443
01:07:53,602 --> 01:07:55,934
I did nothing.

444
01:08:00,109 --> 01:08:02,475
- I need something...
- Get out of my house.

445
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:06,274
- that was precious to him
to make this stop.

446
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:09,007
You get out of my house!
Do you hear me?!

447
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:51,983
Stop!

448
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:58,463
Claire.

449
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:03,828
Claire.

450
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:16,784
I'll take care of it.

451
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:26,219
Claire.

452
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:11,766
Claire!

453
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:14,528
Claire!

454
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:29,180
Claire?

455
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:38,093
- Claire.
- Hunt!

456
01:11:39,194 --> 01:11:40,889
Claire?

457
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:44,827
Claire.

458
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:22,731
Hunt!

459
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:12,715
Hunt!

460
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:16,554
Hey, give me your hand.

461
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:19,319
I got you. Come on. I got you.

462
01:13:40,182 --> 01:13:42,343
We went to the house.

463
01:13:47,689 --> 01:13:50,351
We knew it would be empty.

464
01:13:50,526 --> 01:13:54,223
And we'd all been drinking.

465
01:14:12,681 --> 01:14:15,013
You're a loser.

466
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:17,675
Go home.
I'll lock up Daddy's house.

467
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:26,019
We thought he'd left.

468
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:37,299
It was an accident, okay? I swear.

469
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:39,773
- Mercy.
- What did you do to her?

470
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:41,307
Put the gun down.

471
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:44,469
I didn't mean to. I'll do anything.
You've got to help me though.

472
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:47,877
- Put it down.
- I'll do anything. Anything. Okay?

473
01:14:50,853 --> 01:14:52,320
Give her to me.

474
01:14:52,788 --> 01:14:54,415
- I'll kill you!
- Easy, easy.

475
01:14:57,659 --> 01:14:59,593
- Fuck it. I'm not going down for this.
- Shut up!

476
01:14:59,761 --> 01:15:01,592
No one's going down for this.

477
01:15:04,032 --> 01:15:06,262
It's gonna be okay.

478
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:09,766
My dad,
he can take care of all of this.

479
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:14,466
All right?
We just need to do something now.

480
01:15:15,711 --> 01:15:17,178
We keep it a secret.

481
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:26,119
Noah.

482
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:36,530
- Noah.
- Let him be.

483
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:53,765
I guess he never really
grew out of it.

484
01:17:00,816 --> 01:17:03,614
We didn't understand.

485
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:05,886
My wife loved the boy.

486
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:10,457
But she wasn't the motherly kind.

487
01:17:12,527 --> 01:17:15,462
She wanted him to grow up fast,
become a man.

488
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:22,801
I saw what she was doing to him.

489
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:27,203
I watched him bend and break.

490
01:17:29,011 --> 01:17:31,411
And I didn't do anything.

491
01:17:40,722 --> 01:17:43,247
Help him stop hurting.

492
01:17:46,361 --> 01:17:47,692
Thank you.

493
01:17:50,232 --> 01:17:52,063
We gotta go.

494
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:51,481
Let me have it.

495
01:19:00,268 --> 01:19:02,168
Where are you?

496
01:19:04,806 --> 01:19:06,603
Come on.

497
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:48,874
Rose?

498
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:58,491
Mercy was looking after us.

499
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:00,958
I went to a Chinese restaurant

500
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:03,120
To buy a loaf of bread, bread, bread

501
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:05,562
They wrapped it up in bubble gum

502
01:20:05,734 --> 01:20:08,498
And this is what
They said, said, said:

503
01:20:08,670 --> 01:20:14,199
"My name is Hi-lo Piccolo,
Piccolo Hi-lo

504
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:16,173
Hi-lo Piccolo, Piccolo..."

505
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:18,608
She brought us here.

506
01:20:19,948 --> 01:20:22,280
With her friends.

507
01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:24,350
Ready or not, here I come.

508
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:30,449
She made us promise
to stay upstairs.

509
01:20:40,602 --> 01:20:41,762
I was hiding.

510
01:21:00,622 --> 01:21:05,252
I was so scared, Rosie.
I didn't know what to do.

511
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:09,595
You guys have to help me.
Okay? I'll do anything.

512
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:13,429
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

513
01:21:16,071 --> 01:21:17,732
Fuck it, I'm not going down for this.

514
01:21:17,906 --> 01:21:21,273
Shut up! No one's going down for this.
Sit down.

515
01:21:22,811 --> 01:21:25,143
It's gonna be okay.

516
01:21:25,747 --> 01:21:28,875
My dad,
he can take care of all of this.

517
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:34,550
We need to do something now.

518
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:37,785
- We'll keep it a secret.
- Where's Claire?

519
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:29,329
I'm so sorry, Rose.

520
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:38,741
Rose.

521
01:24:26,995 --> 01:24:28,963
Do you remember this?
Do you want it?

522
01:24:30,999 --> 01:24:31,988
Do you want it?

523
01:24:36,971 --> 01:24:38,700
No!

524
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:55,279
Give her to me!

525
01:24:55,957 --> 01:25:00,155
You can't have her! Not this time!

526
01:25:06,434 --> 01:25:09,130
Claire! It's the door.

527
01:25:09,604 --> 01:25:12,698
The door is the port.
Break the glass.

528
01:25:13,641 --> 01:25:14,869
Break the door!

529
01:25:15,343 --> 01:25:17,811
Smash it! Hey!

530
01:25:19,147 --> 01:25:22,810
Hey, you come over here.
Come over here.

531
01:25:43,304 --> 01:25:46,865
Help! Help me!

532
01:25:57,619 --> 01:25:59,348
Hunt!

533
01:25:59,521 --> 01:26:02,251
- Throw me the blanket!
- Lead him to the door!

534
01:26:02,857 --> 01:26:04,347
To the door, Claire!

535
01:26:08,596 --> 01:26:10,530
Brendan!

536
01:28:21,162 --> 01:28:22,925
Bury it.

537
01:28:24,432 --> 01:28:26,423
Someplace dry.

538
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:33,603
Thank you.
