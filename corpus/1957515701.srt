1
00:02:29,963 --> 00:02:31,473
Good morning sexy!

2
00:02:32,806 --> 00:02:34,716
Should I wear a tie today?

3
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:39,764
I don't even bother.

4
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:42,771
No one looks to me.
Their noses are too busy down there.

5
00:02:43,032 --> 00:02:43,612
Hassles!

6
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,300
Should I take the day off?

7
00:02:47,893 --> 00:02:49,233
Surprise Beth.

8
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,790
That's a great idea.

9
00:02:52,953 --> 00:02:54,523
Let it go just!

10
00:03:22,381 --> 00:03:24,351
Yeah, I will be there too.

11
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,443
You know the place I'm talking about?

12
00:03:27,092 --> 00:03:30,592
Okay, Beth. Okay, cool.
I'll see you down there..

13
00:04:17,068 --> 00:04:18,398
- It'so beautiful down here!

14
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,110
Such a gorgeous place.

15
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:24,112
Thanks for taking the day off.

16
00:04:24,147 --> 00:04:24,733
- To make our plan.

17
00:04:26,787 --> 00:04:29,747
I love this place.
It's so peaceful and quiet.

18
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:30,603
- Yeah.

19
00:04:32,308 --> 00:04:35,318
Mum and dad used to bring me down here

20
00:04:35,558 --> 00:04:36,718
You can...

21
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:39,049
Oh, just so many picnics just over there.

22
00:04:39,206 --> 00:04:40,917
- We used to come canoeing here
when we were kids.

23
00:04:41,185 --> 00:04:41,645
- Really?

24
00:04:41,878 --> 00:04:45,912
It was a journey that used to take 
what seems like a million miles away from reality.

25
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,828
We used to start all the way down there,

26
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:49,757
and make the way passed this point,

27
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:51,739
and, believe it or not,

28
00:04:52,196 --> 00:04:54,536
there was always someone sitting
right here.

29
00:04:54,807 --> 00:04:55,317
- Oh, fuck!

30
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:57,153
Do you really liked sitting in this spot?

31
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,850
- Yeah.

32
00:04:58,763 --> 00:04:59,333
Come here.

33
00:05:13,385 --> 00:05:13,905
- Ryan

34
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,033
Are you sure about this wedding?

35
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,325
- Of course I am, Beth!

36
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:28,552
I love you more than anything.

37
00:05:30,388 --> 00:05:32,168
- It's not that...It's just...

38
00:05:32,203 --> 00:05:32,526
- Look.

39
00:05:33,688 --> 00:05:35,138
Everything is gonna be okay.

40
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,412
- I know. It's just...
I guess I'm being silly.

41
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,530
Look, you've not been silly.
You've just been you.

42
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,852
The only thing I know is
that we love each other

43
00:05:49,335 --> 00:05:51,355
and...
- We are good friends.

44
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,016
- Yes, we are the best friends.

45
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:58,689
Everything is going to be okay.

46
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,672
When everything seemed fine

47
00:06:57,707 --> 00:06:58,750
and going to plan.

48
00:06:59,034 --> 00:07:01,019
Just before the big day
we had a fight.

49
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:03,167
- Nothing else to say about that.
- It could be over!

50
00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:04,437
- It could be over!

51
00:07:04,774 --> 00:07:05,283
- It's over!

52
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,504
- Wait Beth! Listen to me!

53
00:07:08,575 --> 00:07:10,036
You start to make me angry.

54
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,328
And you know what happens 
when I get angry.

55
00:07:30,045 --> 00:07:32,265
After Beth and I got out our last word

56
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,290
and had a chance to calm down,

57
00:07:34,325 --> 00:07:37,595
she told me that she tought we should have
some space for each other.

58
00:07:38,303 --> 00:07:41,356
They say that in life, you can have
two things guaranteed,

59
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:43,591
death and taxes.

60
00:07:44,362 --> 00:07:46,803
Somewhere in there,
they should add a breaking-up.

61
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:47,911
Well,

62
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:49,491
that's life!

63
00:08:58,795 --> 00:09:02,303
I noticed that I stopped in a part of town
very unfamiliar to me.

64
00:09:03,144 --> 00:09:06,610
I found myself staring at a very strange
looking dark red building.

65
00:09:07,751 --> 00:09:10,491
It seemed to have all the normal
traces of an older building.

66
00:09:11,153 --> 00:09:12,805
But there was something unusual about it.

67
00:09:13,697 --> 00:09:18,124
One by one, guys began to make their way
into what appeared to be a club entrance.

68
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,180
Since became very apparent to me

69
00:09:21,355 --> 00:09:23,855
that this was a gay nightclub.

70
00:09:25,393 --> 00:09:28,113
I have to admit, my curiosity
was getting unbearable.

71
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:30,908
For some strange, unimaginable reason,

72
00:09:31,555 --> 00:09:33,820
I was curious to see what this place
was all about.

73
00:09:35,405 --> 00:09:37,105
Maybe it was curiosity.

74
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,849
Maybe was the split up with Beth.

75
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,358
Whatever it was,

76
00:09:41,393 --> 00:09:42,866
I was ready for it.

77
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:45,220
I walked over to the club entrance,

78
00:09:45,255 --> 00:09:47,012
and then made my way discreetly.

79
00:09:47,895 --> 00:09:49,105
The lion's den.

80
00:11:26,938 --> 00:11:28,208
- Thought you weren't coming in tonight.

81
00:11:28,469 --> 00:11:30,223
- Yes, just got called in at the last minute.
- Oh, cool

82
00:11:33,037 --> 00:11:35,186
- Well, I'm on in five. 
So, I better get going.

83
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,212
- Okay. I'm going to check up the renovations

84
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,980
- Don't do anything stupid.

85
00:11:39,755 --> 00:11:41,965
To piss go off. Break a leg.

86
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,500
- What ever happended to the innocence?

87
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:13,085
Fuck it.
Who cares anyway?

88
00:12:13,964 --> 00:12:17,127
Look at me. My god!
I'm so fucking hot.

89
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,801
I love when guys look at me,

90
00:12:21,586 --> 00:12:22,710
pervert me

91
00:12:22,745 --> 00:12:24,864
and wonder what would be like to touch me,

92
00:12:25,293 --> 00:12:26,113
feel me,

93
00:12:26,868 --> 00:12:27,808
taste me

94
00:12:28,586 --> 00:12:30,336
Hell! Even fuck me!

95
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:39,517
- Dear Ryan,

96
00:30:39,817 --> 00:30:43,077
I'm writing you this letter
for many reasons.

97
00:30:43,326 --> 00:30:45,392
First thing that I miss you and
I love you.

98
00:30:46,757 --> 00:30:47,554
The second

99
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,863
is to let you know how I'm doing
and what I'm feeling.

100
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,978
I'm seeing things a little bit
more clearly now.

101
00:30:55,078 --> 00:30:57,593
I feel we have all grown in many ways, yet

102
00:30:57,979 --> 00:31:00,009
pulled away from each other
in many ways as well.

103
00:31:01,562 --> 00:31:03,343
I need more time
to sort out things.

104
00:31:04,913 --> 00:31:07,919
I want to thank you for being my best friend
and being understanding.

105
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:19,116
I know this time apart is
the better for both of us.

106
00:31:20,443 --> 00:31:21,464
Your best friend, Beth.

107
00:31:49,716 --> 00:31:50,642
- Hey man, how're you doing?

108
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:52,181
What do you think of my show?

109
00:31:53,271 --> 00:31:54,288
- It was good.

110
00:31:55,105 --> 00:31:55,915
- Great music, eh!

111
00:31:57,044 --> 00:31:58,844
- A bit loud though.

112
00:31:59,356 --> 00:32:00,806
- It's a nightclub.

113
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,510
I haven't seen you here before.

114
00:32:04,228 --> 00:32:05,908
- It's my first time.

115
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:07,069
- Virgin?

116
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:11,999
Wanna see something really cool?

117
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:13,741
Come with me.

118
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,023
- Ah, I'm not sure

119
00:32:16,385 --> 00:32:17,715
- Come on, I don't bite.

120
00:32:18,128 --> 00:32:18,468
Come on!

121
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:20,180
This way.

122
00:45:30,855 --> 00:45:32,475
- It's okay and now relax. Shhh!

123
00:45:36,187 --> 00:45:37,807
It's okay and now relax.

124
00:45:42,123 --> 00:45:44,263
It's everything okay?
You're alright?

125
00:45:48,789 --> 00:45:50,929
It's everything okay?
Are you alright?

126
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:56,430
- It seemed someone was having 
a good time.

127
00:56:57,808 --> 00:56:59,568
- Oh man!
I feel like shit.

128
00:56:59,955 --> 00:57:00,355
- Here.

129
00:57:02,113 --> 00:57:03,873
Take one of these.
It's gonna make you to feel better.

130
00:57:04,615 --> 00:57:05,775
- No, no drugs.

131
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:08,070
- It's okay. Promise. Trust me.

132
00:57:13,188 --> 00:57:14,408
Just swallow straight now.

133
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:24,010
It will take a while,
but you'll feel better soon.

134
00:57:24,453 --> 00:57:25,263
Come with me.

135
00:57:27,381 --> 00:57:27,721
Come on.

136
01:10:15,894 --> 01:10:17,164
- What a hot fuck that was.

137
01:10:17,796 --> 01:10:18,918
Sorry. I get to go.

138
01:10:19,165 --> 01:10:19,685
- Wait!

139
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:22,510
What about me?

140
01:10:23,347 --> 01:10:25,537
- What about you?
Just another fuck.

141
01:10:26,334 --> 01:10:28,194
I don't fall in love with fucks.

142
01:10:28,493 --> 01:10:30,413
What were you expecting?
A wedding?

143
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:31,437
See you.

144
01:11:10,667 --> 01:11:13,397
Sometime our curiosity
get the best of us.

145
01:11:14,193 --> 01:11:16,361
Sometime leave us hanging in suspense


146
01:11:16,762 --> 01:11:19,408
and what feel like a million miles
away from reality.

147
01:11:20,083 --> 01:11:24,611
There is no magic spell or wonderful, real answers
about sex, life and love.

148
01:11:25,262 --> 01:11:27,292
Beth and I never got married.

149
01:11:27,552 --> 01:11:32,392
and we actually ended up having a few drinks
and a few laughs over the all thing.

150
01:11:32,702 --> 01:11:33,981
Looking back on it,

151
01:11:34,016 --> 01:11:35,886
she knew exactly 
what I was going through,

152
01:11:36,249 --> 01:11:37,082
what I was feeling,

153
01:11:37,828 --> 01:11:38,599
what I was thinking,

154
01:11:39,505 --> 01:11:41,009
even what I was doing.

155
01:11:41,685 --> 01:11:44,197
And above all,
she allowed me to be me,

156
01:11:45,035 --> 01:11:47,009
to let me see throughout the curiosity

157
01:11:47,405 --> 01:11:48,819
that had such a strong hold on me

158
01:11:49,038 --> 01:11:50,368
for all those years.

159
01:11:51,788 --> 01:11:53,638
She had been and would remain

160
01:11:53,891 --> 01:11:55,401
my best friend

161
01:11:56,494 --> 01:11:57,364
forever.
