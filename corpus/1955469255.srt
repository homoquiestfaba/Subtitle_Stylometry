1
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:03,279
Was it the holidays?

2
00:00:03,479 --> 00:00:04,939
Uh, it wasn't that.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,860
Well, then why'd you
decide to come in tonight?

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:07,940
Um...

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,200
I'm trying to fix my mind.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,879
Howard is a brilliant man.

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,860
And he's not just a boss,
he's a friend.

9
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,260
He lost his child, and now he doesn't care
if he loses everything else.

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,780
This might be the strangest thing
I have ever come across.

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,599
He writes letters.

12
00:00:29,799 --> 00:00:31,119
Who are they to?

13
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,200
Howard doesn't write letters to people.
He writes to things.

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,500
"Time". "Love". "Death".

15
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,340
Kids write letters to Santa Claus.
It doesn't mean they're crazy.

16
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,060
No, this is therapeutic.

17
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,319
You're gonna think I'm crazy,
but I'm having conversations.

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,640
"Death" came first.
She met me in the dog park.

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,200
Charmed, I'm sure.

20
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,480
So "Death" is a her.

21
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,660
Turns out "Death"
is an elderly white woman.

22
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,959
Remember me?
I'm "Time".

23
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,779
You wrote me because you need me.

24
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,880
Howard...

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,640
Ask her. Go ahead.
Ask her if she can see me.

26
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,880
He was sitting right here.

27
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,720
And he just appeared, right?

28
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,680
I'm "Love".

29
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,039
And I'm the fabric of life.

30
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,880
Something's starting to happen to you.

31
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,120
Howard?

32
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,259
I don't know what to do
to bring you back.

33
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,039
What if "Love", "Death", and "Time"
are trying to help you?

34
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,860
You need to talk to them, Howard.

35
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,340
Challenge them.
Just engage.

36
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,290
"Love" is the reason for everything.

37
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,180
I felt you everyday
when she laughed.

38
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,820
And you broke my heart.

39
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,280
I was there in her laugh,
but I'm also here now in your pain.

40
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,160
He's reaching out
to the cosmos for answers.

41
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,520
Just be sure to notice
the collateral beauty

42
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,320
Its the profound connection to everything.

43
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,820
If he accepts that,
maybe he gets to find his life again.

45
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,280
You're not here to take me, are you?

46
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,940
No, Howard.
I'm here to ride the F train with you.
