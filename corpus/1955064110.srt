Timing was modified by:D.LUFF Y

2
00:02:12,747 --> 00:02:14,547
Melanie: this is the world.

3
00:02:19,047 --> 00:02:22,747
And this is the center of it.
At least we think so.

4
00:02:31,747 --> 00:02:35,147
That's me. My name's melanie.
My friends call me me l.

5
00:02:36,247 --> 00:02:39,347
That's my sister ally son, a.k.a. Ally.

6
00:02:41,347 --> 00:02:43,447
And this is junior high,

7
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:47,447
Where we spend approximately
30 % of our waking hours.

8
00:02:48,947 --> 00:02:51,047
And 4 % of our sleeping hours.

9
00:02:53,247 --> 00:02:56,347
I mean, don't get me wrong.
We study a lot of important subjects.

10
00:02:57,347 --> 00:02:59,547
For example, there's science.

11
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,347
See for yourself.

12
00:03:02,647 --> 00:03:05,747
It's true.
Both: kelly has split ends.

13
00:03:05,847 --> 00:03:07,147
Melanie: then there's english.

14
00:03:07,347 --> 00:03:09,547
She was totally edging on my squeeze.

15
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:12,847
Soi dinged her with a bounce-bounce
In the numbers lab.

16
00:03:13,247 --> 00:03:15,547
Melanie: and then there's creative writing.

17
00:03:23,147 --> 00:03:26,747
And finally, that most important of important subjects,

18
00:03:26,947 --> 00:03:30,147
The staple of every seventh grader's education...

19
00:03:30,647 --> 00:03:31,947
Social studies.

20
00:03:32,147 --> 00:03:36,147
The most popular boys in north wood junior high.

21
00:03:36,647 --> 00:03:38,247
At least this week.

22
00:03:40,147 --> 00:03:43,147
Enter helene and darlene.
Cheerleaders.

23
00:03:43,447 --> 00:03:44,547
Enough said.

24
00:03:46,947 --> 00:03:49,847
[sighs] i wish they'd ask us
To the spring fling dance.

25
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:53,847
Yeah, well, we can't get near them
With tweedledum and tweedledumber around.

26
00:03:54,347 --> 00:03:57,047
- Kyle, let's snack some lime slime.
- Dude.

27
00:04:00,747 --> 00:04:04,147
But if you can't beat 'em, mess with their heads.

28
00:04:05,947 --> 00:04:08,747
It's super top secret.

29
00:04:09,347 --> 00:04:12,247
Come on, me l, i promise not to tell anybody.

30
00:04:12,847 --> 00:04:14,247
Well, i heard

31
00:04:14,447 --> 00:04:18,247
5 kids went home sick today
After eating the meatloaf.

32
00:04:20,247 --> 00:04:24,847
The meat was so bad it had e. Coli
And f. Coli.

33
00:04:25,347 --> 00:04:27,647
Did it have those little white worms?

34
00:04:28,347 --> 00:04:30,747
No. Those brown squishy worms.

35
00:04:31,847 --> 00:04:33,747
Like this one.

36
00:04:38,647 --> 00:04:39,647
[screaming]
It worked.

37
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:41,747
Hey, melanie.

38
00:04:42,047 --> 00:04:43,647
- Hey, ally.
- Hey.

39
00:04:44,147 --> 00:04:46,947
- I'm melanie. That's ally.
- Oh. Right.

40
00:04:48,147 --> 00:04:50,847
- Worm?
- Gross-out candy. Cool.

41
00:04:51,047 --> 00:04:53,147
- You guys are all right.
- Both: thanks.

42
00:05:04,747 --> 00:05:07,447
- Mmm. Great dinner, mom.
- Where's the fire?

43
00:05:07,647 --> 00:05:10,147
- I have to call to Hannah.
- After i call jenna.

44
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:11,747
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

45
00:05:11,847 --> 00:05:15,847
Don't you guys have something else
To do tonight besides talk on the phone?

46
00:05:16,447 --> 00:05:18,047
Like what?

47
00:05:18,547 --> 00:05:21,547
- Um, a little thing we used to call homework?
- We already did it.Swear.

48
00:05:23,347 --> 00:05:26,747
- We do mat h homework during science...
- And science during english...

49
00:05:26,847 --> 00:05:28,547
And everything else during social studies.

50
00:05:28,747 --> 00:05:30,747
That class is so s and c.

51
00:05:31,447 --> 00:05:32,547
S and c

52
00:05:33,447 --> 00:05:34,947
Snooze and cruise.

53
00:05:35,047 --> 00:05:36,547
Talk about a bore war.

54
00:05:36,747 --> 00:05:38,147
It's totally... [snores]

55
00:05:43,347 --> 00:05:46,047
If we were running the world,
There'd be no wars,

56
00:05:46,247 --> 00:05:47,447
that's for sure.

57
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,147
There'd be so many pool parties,
And everybody would be in a great mood.

58
00:05:51,747 --> 00:05:54,047
Nobody likes to fight in a bikini.

59
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,647
Mind?

60
00:06:00,947 --> 00:06:05,247
Ok, who'd you rather kiss--
Kyle or leonardo dicaprio?

61
00:06:06,047 --> 00:06:08,547
Get out. He does too shower.

62
00:06:09,547 --> 00:06:14,347
They're turning 13 next month,
And their world is the size of a pinhead.

63
00:06:14,647 --> 00:06:16,547
I heard they're opening up a max store at the mall

64
00:06:16,747 --> 00:06:18,647
Right next to kenneth cole.

65
00:06:18,947 --> 00:06:21,147
I think a pinhead is bigger.

66
00:06:22,147 --> 00:06:24,847
[laughs] Honey,
i don't know what more We can expect from them.

67
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:28,447
- They're both getting straight as.
- But it's not about grades, jack.

68
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:30,847
It's about life.

69
00:06:31,247 --> 00:06:35,347
I mean there's more to the world than call waiting
And a day at the mall.

70
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:38,247
It's up to us to show them.

71
00:06:38,547 --> 00:06:41,147
What do you have in mind?

72
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:46,047
In 1805, napoleon upgraded the sewers

73
00:06:46,247 --> 00:06:50,447
So that he could claim France had the
most advanced water system in the world.

74
00:06:51,147 --> 00:06:53,547
The time between his escape from elba

75
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,547
To his ultimate defeat at water loo
Was called the 100 days

76
00:06:56,747 --> 00:06:59,447
Because it took, well, 100 days.

77
00:07:00,147 --> 00:07:02,647
In 1815, after his exile to elba,

78
00:07:02,747 --> 00:07:05,747
Napoleon sadly disappeared from the world's stage.

79
00:07:06,547 --> 00:07:09,247
Napoleon died on may 5, 1821.

80
00:07:14,847 --> 00:07:16,247
Hmm. What have we here?

81
00:07:18,747 --> 00:07:23,247
"me l, how 'bout shane and me take you and al
To spring fling dance?"

82
00:07:24,447 --> 00:07:27,247
Hmm. Well, melanie,
What do you have to say for yourself?

83
00:07:31,147 --> 00:07:32,447
"definitely."
[class laughs, bell rings]

84
00:07:38,447 --> 00:07:41,947
- "thursday, margie's beach party.
- Friday, hannah's pool party,"

85
00:07:42,247 --> 00:07:45,447
And saturday, spring fling with gorgeous shane.

86
00:07:45,647 --> 00:07:47,447
And perfect kyle.

87
00:07:47,847 --> 00:07:50,747
And that still leaves time for hanging at the mall.

88
00:07:50,947 --> 00:07:53,347
Why can't it be spring break all year round?

89
00:07:56,147 --> 00:07:57,247
[knock on door]
Knock, knock.

90
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:04,247
Now wait a minute.
You guys are supposed to say, "who's there?"

91
00:08:05,547 --> 00:08:08,047
Uh, dad, we're a little old for knock-knock jokes.

92
00:08:08,247 --> 00:08:10,247
Dad, that's so barney.

93
00:08:10,547 --> 00:08:12,447
Then i guess you're too old for presents.

94
00:08:12,647 --> 00:08:14,047
- No! Presents? No. Presents?
- Ok.

95
00:08:15,147 --> 00:08:16,347
Very good.

96
00:08:22,147 --> 00:08:24,747
- Camera?
- Passport? Where are we going?

97
00:08:26,447 --> 00:08:27,447
Paris?

98
00:08:27,547 --> 00:08:29,747
- We're going to par is?
- You're going to par is.

99
00:08:29,947 --> 00:08:31,447
We're going to par is!

100
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:35,847
- When are we going to par is?
- Next week over spring break.

101
00:08:36,647 --> 00:08:37,847
Nooooo!

102
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,847
In 1815, after his exile to elba,

103
00:08:44,947 --> 00:08:47,747
Napoleon sadly disappeared from the world's stage.

104
00:08:48,947 --> 00:08:50,247
Napoleon also had plans...

105
00:08:50,347 --> 00:08:52,747
Melanie: we wanted to go to par is,
Really, we did.

106
00:08:53,047 --> 00:08:55,947
We were just majorly bummed about missing the dance.

107
00:08:56,347 --> 00:09:00,447
Anyway, we sent notes to kyle and shane
Explaining why we had to bail.

108
00:09:02,147 --> 00:09:04,047
They were bummed, too.

109
00:09:05,247 --> 00:09:07,147
For about a millisecond.
******

110
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:12,447
They didn't even wait an hour before asking
Helene and darlene to the dance.

111
00:09:14,747 --> 00:09:18,447
Forget kyle and shane.
I can't believe we even liked those dorks.

112
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:20,547
They couldn't even tell us apart.

113
00:09:20,847 --> 00:09:22,047
I guess.

114
00:09:22,247 --> 00:09:25,947
It's just that i thought that shane
Was gonna be my first real boyfriend.

115
00:09:28,347 --> 00:09:32,147
Wait. What if we don't get asked out again
Until we're, like, 20?

116
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,947
We'll do what everyone else does--
Blame our parents.

117
00:09:42,747 --> 00:09:44,547
[knock on door]
Hey, hey, how's the packing coming?

118
00:09:46,147 --> 00:09:47,447
What can i say?

119
00:09:47,547 --> 00:09:48,947
We're teenagers.

120
00:09:52,647 --> 00:09:55,347
Grandpa is sending a car to pick you up at the airport.

121
00:09:55,547 --> 00:09:58,347
Can't believe we have to spend a whole week
With grandpa edward.

122
00:09:58,547 --> 00:09:59,547
He's so strict.

123
00:09:59,747 --> 00:10:02,847
I know. You might as well Just send us to prison.
It's probably a lot cheaper.

124
00:10:03,847 --> 00:10:07,747
I know your grandpa is not great with you girls--
Mom

125
00:10:07,947 --> 00:10:11,547
that's like saying
The titanic's not great with icebergs.

126
00:10:12,147 --> 00:10:14,047
Ok, ok.

127
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,647
Try to understand.

128
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:18,547
Come here.

129
00:10:18,647 --> 00:10:20,247
Try to understand ...

130
00:10:20,847 --> 00:10:23,447
Your grandfather is the ambassador to franc e.

131
00:10:24,447 --> 00:10:26,247
He's a very, very busy man,

132
00:10:27,247 --> 00:10:29,147
And he loves you both very much.

133
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,847
He just sometimes forgets to show it.

134
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,947
I'm sorry you're gonna miss the dance.

135
00:10:38,747 --> 00:10:40,947
But there will be others, i promise.

136
00:10:43,647 --> 00:10:45,247
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

137
00:10:45,447 --> 00:10:46,547
Love you.

138
00:10:51,747 --> 00:10:54,047
- I get window seat.
- No, you always get window seat.

139
00:10:54,247 --> 00:10:55,447
- Do not.
- Do too.

140
00:10:55,647 --> 00:10:58,747
- Mel, me l, do you have the, uh ...
- Passports?

141
00:10:59,447 --> 00:11:01,447
- Ally, do you have the ...
- Tickets?

142
00:11:01,947 --> 00:11:04,247
Mom, don't worry.
We're, like, 13.

143
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:06,547
We're not kids any more.

144
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:15,647
[door closes]
You're on my side of the car.

145
00:11:16,047 --> 00:11:17,747
- Am not.
- Are too.

146
00:11:17,947 --> 00:11:19,247
I'm worried.

147
00:11:19,547 --> 00:11:20,647
What, about them?

148
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,647
[sighs] about par is.

149
00:11:29,547 --> 00:11:30,947
Melanie: it was a long flight.

150
00:11:31,247 --> 00:11:33,147
Flight attendant: welcome to american airlines.

151
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:37,147
Our flight today will be cruising
At an altitude of 35,000 feet.

152
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,247
Bienvenue suis american airlines...

153
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,847
[speaking french] Melanie: ally and i talked
most of the way, And then we fell asleep.

154
00:12:03,547 --> 00:12:04,747
By the time we woke up...

155
00:12:04,847 --> 00:12:07,447
Flight attendant: ladies and gentlemen,
Please fasten your seat belts

156
00:12:07,647 --> 00:12:09,447
As we make our final descent into par is.

157
00:12:16,447 --> 00:12:18,047
[speaks french]
Look, the eiffel tower.

158
00:12:19,747 --> 00:12:21,947
- Ooh, look at it
- Take a picture.

159
00:12:24,147 --> 00:12:25,747
Is this the champs elysees?

160
00:12:25,847 --> 00:12:28,047
This is where all the major shopping is.

161
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,847
Oh, i so want to go here.

162
00:12:29,947 --> 00:12:31,747
Look how cute that boy is.

163
00:12:32,747 --> 00:12:36,647
Look at that car.
Oh, my gosh. It's so tiny.

164
00:12:37,747 --> 00:12:39,847
Look. Arc de trio mph.

165
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:41,147
Take a picture.

166
00:12:44,147 --> 00:12:46,947
I get to practice my french here.
This is so cool.

167
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:48,947
That's not re dame.

168
00:12:49,047 --> 00:12:50,647
Look at that building.

169
00:12:50,847 --> 00:12:52,547
Beautiful bridge.

170
00:12:52,947 --> 00:12:55,547
I wonder if grandpa will have any time for us.

171
00:12:56,047 --> 00:12:57,447
Hope so.

172
00:13:09,647 --> 00:13:12,447
Yes, the ambassador's
very interested in your position.

173
00:13:13,647 --> 00:13:16,147
I'll have to get back to you on that.
Au revoir.

174
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:21,647
I'm jeremy bluff,
Special assistant to the ambassador.

175
00:13:21,847 --> 00:13:24,247
Your grandfather's just finishing up
A conference call.

176
00:13:24,447 --> 00:13:26,847
- Now which of you is which?
- I'm melanie. She's ally.

177
00:13:26,947 --> 00:13:28,047
For today.

178
00:13:31,647 --> 00:13:33,147
Tough crowd.

179
00:13:43,547 --> 00:13:45,047
Wow!

180
00:13:45,747 --> 00:13:48,647
For a civil servant,
Grandpa's doing all right.

181
00:13:50,147 --> 00:13:53,047
- Is that my granddaughters?
- Both: hi, grandpa.

182
00:13:56,547 --> 00:13:58,047
Welcome to par is.

183
00:14:01,947 --> 00:14:03,547
It's been far too long.

184
00:14:03,647 --> 00:14:06,047
Almost 15 months since i've been to the states.

185
00:14:06,247 --> 00:14:09,847
Oh, françois. My granddaughters,
Allyson and melanie.

186
00:14:10,447 --> 00:14:12,347
Charmed, mademoiselles.

187
00:14:14,247 --> 00:14:17,847
Oh, henri. My granddaughters.
They've just arrived in from the states.

188
00:14:18,247 --> 00:14:19,647
Ah, honored and proud. I am henri.

189
00:14:19,847 --> 00:14:23,347
And, no, i have no hot dogs or peanuts butter.

190
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:27,747
Now, if you'll excuse me. I have a casserole
just moments from dessert.

191
00:14:28,447 --> 00:14:30,447
Jeremy, just in time.

192
00:14:38,447 --> 00:14:40,947
Unfortunately, girls,
I've got a very busy schedule this week,

193
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:43,947
Soi will be unable
To chaperone you around the city.

194
00:14:44,347 --> 00:14:47,147
However, my good assistant jeremy here

195
00:14:47,347 --> 00:14:49,447
Will be happy to act as your tour guide.

196
00:14:49,647 --> 00:14:51,847
- Me? But, sir, i ...
- It's all been arranged.

197
00:14:52,047 --> 00:14:54,547
I've got a full itinerary set
For each day.

198
00:14:55,347 --> 00:14:56,447
Yes, sir.

199
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:59,147
Great. We're stuck with bore-zilla.

200
00:14:59,347 --> 00:15:01,647
We'll at least have fun torturing him all week.

201
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:03,347
Let me remind you

202
00:15:03,447 --> 00:15:06,747
young ladies, That while you're here
You are representative of the american people,

203
00:15:07,447 --> 00:15:10,947
And i expect you
To comport yourselves like such... As ladies

204
00:15:11,347 --> 00:15:12,347
Is that correct?

205
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:18,747
Here is the library.
Down the hall is the drawing room.

206
00:15:19,047 --> 00:15:21,347
Wow. A room just for drawing.
I'm impressed.

207
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:25,747
And your room is up the stairs
Second door from the left!

208
00:15:30,747 --> 00:15:33,847
Dorothy, we're definitely not in kansas any more.

209
00:15:49,547 --> 00:15:50,747
[french accent] i'm henri.

210
00:15:51,447 --> 00:15:54,547
The american cooking, it tastes like
Ze ca-ca poo-poo.

211
00:16:00,247 --> 00:16:03,147
The hot diggity doggies.

212
00:16:37,147 --> 00:16:38,847
What the devil is all this noise?

213
00:16:39,747 --> 00:16:42,047
- You mean the music?
- No, i mean my granddaughters.

214
00:16:44,047 --> 00:16:47,547
This behavior is entirely unacceptable
Here in the embassy.

215
00:16:48,747 --> 00:16:51,447
Now, dinner is going to be served promptly
At 1900 hours.

216
00:16:51,947 --> 00:16:55,347
I expect you girls to be on time And dressed
for the occasion. Is that understood?

217
00:16:56,247 --> 00:16:57,247
Yes.

218
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:05,847
[door closes] Melanie: we were in par is for 10 minutes,
And we were already in trouble.

219
00:17:06,147 --> 00:17:09,547
Little did we know
Our stomachs were about to be in even bigger trouble.

220
00:17:09,747 --> 00:17:12,047
First course, escargot henri,

221
00:17:12,147 --> 00:17:17,147
Served at precisely 129 degrees centigrade
Or all is lost.

222
00:17:17,647 --> 00:17:18,747
Bon appétit.

223
00:17:18,947 --> 00:17:21,447
Thank you, henri.
You can eat up now, girls.

224
00:17:22,047 --> 00:17:23,747
What is this stuff, françois?

225
00:17:24,147 --> 00:17:25,347
Escargot.

226
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:28,547
That is so french.
We're eating escargot.

227
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:30,947
Girls, i had no idea you liked snails.

228
00:17:42,647 --> 00:17:44,047
Pate de foie gr as.

229
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:47,247
That would be...

230
00:17:47,447 --> 00:17:50,047
The poached liver of a force-fed goose.

231
00:17:53,047 --> 00:17:55,747
Frog legs in a lemon butter sauce.

232
00:17:58,247 --> 00:17:59,547
Calf's brains.

233
00:18:03,447 --> 00:18:04,947
Check, please.

234
00:18:08,847 --> 00:18:11,347
I'm starving.
I can't sleep on an empty stomach.

235
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:15,047
I feel your pain, but what are we gonna do,
Order a pizza?

236
00:18:19,447 --> 00:18:23,547
Ecoute, mon vieux, no one at the embassy
nothing would order the Pizza Hut.

237
00:18:25,347 --> 00:18:27,347
Half pepperoni, half sausage?

238
00:18:28,747 --> 00:18:30,847
Don't forget the tip, henri.

239
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:47,647
[speaking french]
Jeremy, i'm holding you personally

240
00:18:47,647 --> 00:18:50,447
responsible
For the welfare of the girls this week.

241
00:18:50,747 --> 00:18:52,447
Sir, you can count on me. I

242
00:18:54,947 --> 00:18:56,647
I've got everything under control.

243
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,347
Unlock the door.

244
00:19:15,647 --> 00:19:17,547
We have a very busy day today, girls.

245
00:19:17,747 --> 00:19:22,047
- From 10:00 to 1:00, we do the louvre.
- Last one to the louvre is a rotten baguette!

246
00:19:22,647 --> 00:19:24,047
Girls, wait ...

247
00:19:27,847 --> 00:19:29,347
Hey, we're walking here.

248
00:19:30,847 --> 00:19:32,147
What are they doing?

249
00:19:32,347 --> 00:19:33,447
Girls, no! Get away from them!

250
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,847
Ah, pardon.

251
00:19:42,747 --> 00:19:44,147
[speaks french]
What'd he say?

252
00:19:44,247 --> 00:19:45,947
Who cares?

253
00:20:07,147 --> 00:20:09,347
"las fleurs de la champs."

254
00:20:12,247 --> 00:20:13,447
Pinch me.

255
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,547
Ow, that hurt.

256
00:20:17,747 --> 00:20:21,547
Jeremy, you've got to pay attention.
We can't even keep our eye off you for one minute.

257
00:20:22,047 --> 00:20:25,647
Yeah, you're a mess. You know, this is the kind
of thing That gives americans a bad name.

258
00:20:26,147 --> 00:20:29,747
Ok, girls, Busy day.
Let's get in line for the museum.

259
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,047
- Let's be open-minded.
- Ok.

260
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:36,547
I'll take the one in the red.

261
00:20:36,847 --> 00:20:38,547
I'm talking about the museum.

262
00:20:38,747 --> 00:20:41,447
Oh, right.
I'll still take the one in the red, though.

263
00:20:42,047 --> 00:20:43,647
Welcome to the louvre,

264
00:20:44,247 --> 00:20:48,947
Home to nearly 20 miles of halls,
400 rooms ...

265
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:52,747
and over one million works of art.

266
00:20:53,347 --> 00:20:54,447
Shall we?

267
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:39,347
Come on, girls, we're late for lunch.

268
00:21:39,547 --> 00:21:42,647
2,360 paintings.

269
00:21:42,847 --> 00:21:45,247
847 sculptures.

270
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:48,247
846. The last one was a security guard.

271
00:21:53,447 --> 00:21:56,847
Yes, yes, the ambassador's very interested
In your position.

272
00:22:01,447 --> 00:22:05,247
- Jeremy, it's totally rude to digi-dial during lunch.
- Totally.

273
00:22:07,047 --> 00:22:08,547
I think i'll order us some drinks to start.

274
00:22:08,747 --> 00:22:10,447
You're gonna order for us?
La poisson, s'il vous plait.

275
00:22:15,847 --> 00:22:18,247
My french teacher says i'm a natural.

276
00:22:21,847 --> 00:22:22,947
Fish?

277
00:22:23,747 --> 00:22:24,947
I didn't order this.

278
00:22:26,947 --> 00:22:27,947
[speaks french]
No.

279
00:22:30,547 --> 00:22:33,147
[speaks french] Excuse me, girls.
Perhaps i can help.

280
00:22:34,147 --> 00:22:37,147
When you ordered poisson,
That means fish.

281
00:22:37,347 --> 00:22:41,147
- Boisson means drink.
- Nice going, madame croissant.

282
00:22:48,447 --> 00:22:51,347
[giggles, speaks french] - I'm brigitte.
- I'm melanie. This is ally.

283
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:55,547
- Hey, you're brigitte.
- Uh, she just said that.

284
00:22:55,747 --> 00:22:57,547
No, the brigitte, the supermodel.

285
00:22:58,047 --> 00:22:59,347
No, she's not.

286
00:23:00,647 --> 00:23:01,747
Is she? Are you?

287
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,347
- I'm afraid so.
- Both: oh, my god.

288
00:23:04,547 --> 00:23:06,647
You were on the cover of tres chic magazine.

289
00:23:06,747 --> 00:23:09,747
You were wearing that
Jean-paul gaultier bathing suit.

290
00:23:10,247 --> 00:23:12,747
Oh, no. Don't tell me you spend all day
With your nose buried

291
00:23:12,947 --> 00:23:14,447
in those fashion magazines.

292
00:23:14,647 --> 00:23:15,847
Well, not all day.

293
00:23:15,947 --> 00:23:18,947
She usually breaks it up with some boy scoping
Or some mall trolling.

294
00:23:21,947 --> 00:23:24,047
[laughs]
I was exactly the same at your age.

295
00:23:24,547 --> 00:23:26,547
So, is this your first time in par is?

296
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,447
Well, par is is such a magical city,

297
00:23:29,647 --> 00:23:31,447
Full of adventure and romance.

298
00:23:32,147 --> 00:23:35,047
Oh, and here is the world's best shopping...

299
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:37,647
[whispers] and the world's cutest boys.

300
00:23:37,847 --> 00:23:39,747
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- Ally.

301
00:23:40,447 --> 00:23:44,547
As it happens, i travel a lot for work
And there's not a lot of time for boyfriends.

302
00:23:56,047 --> 00:23:59,547
- Now what'd you say?
- I just said i liked her perfume, I think.

303
00:24:01,347 --> 00:24:03,747
Ally, i'm afraid you told her she stinks.

304
00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:08,047
Oh. I'm late for a fitting.

305
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:12,047
I'm doing a photo shoot
At jar din de luxembourg on thursday.

306
00:24:12,247 --> 00:24:14,047
Well, nice to meet you girls.

307
00:24:14,247 --> 00:24:17,047
And, ally, be careful how you use your french.

308
00:24:17,947 --> 00:24:19,647
Ciao, girls, nice to meet you.

309
00:24:19,647 --> 00:24:22,447
And remember, this is par is.
Have fun. Ciao.

310
00:24:24,147 --> 00:24:26,347
All right, girls,
Let's go.

311
00:24:26,547 --> 00:24:28,447
Time to see the rest of the museums.

312
00:24:28,647 --> 00:24:30,847
Museums? As in plural?

313
00:25:02,347 --> 00:25:04,547
[sighs] Jeremy: would you pass the salt please,
mr. Ambassador?

314
00:25:08,347 --> 00:25:10,047
So, what did you girls learn today?

315
00:25:10,247 --> 00:25:11,647
- Both: learn?
- Jinx.

316
00:25:17,047 --> 00:25:20,047
Girls? What exactly is going on?

317
00:25:20,747 --> 00:25:23,747
Oh, i just jinxed her, grandpa.
Now she can't talk till i say her name.

318
00:25:24,447 --> 00:25:25,647
Gee, what a shame.

319
00:25:27,847 --> 00:25:30,047
Mr. Ambassador, sir, i was wondering

320
00:25:30,247 --> 00:25:33,347
If you've had the opportunity
To review my position paper...

321
00:25:33,647 --> 00:25:36,347
Felony, relony, selony, telony, belony

322
00:25:36,447 --> 00:25:37,647
Melanie!

323
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:41,547
Melanie.

324
00:25:42,647 --> 00:25:45,747
- Jeremy: as i was saying, uh, sir, i ...
- Jeremy, we've been over this before.

325
00:25:46,247 --> 00:25:48,247
Saturday night is not your concern.

326
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:50,147
What's happening saturday night?

327
00:25:50,147 --> 00:25:54,147
Well, the embassy is hosting a gala banquet
For the french foreign minister and his wife.

328
00:25:54,947 --> 00:25:58,047
You girls will get the chance
To see diplomacy at work, first-hand.

329
00:25:59,147 --> 00:26:01,347
Sounds like snore-zilla, the sequel.

330
00:26:02,847 --> 00:26:05,447
Ally: man, this country is weird..
Grape juice with dinner?

331
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:08,647
No, no. It is not grape juice. It is...

332
00:26:10,247 --> 00:26:11,247
Wine.

333
00:26:14,247 --> 00:26:16,547
A fine beaujolais, if i'm not mistaken.

334
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:25,047
I can't believe grandpa had such a cow
Over the wine spritzer

335
00:26:25,347 --> 00:26:26,447
It was an accident.

336
00:26:26,547 --> 00:26:28,647
Why can't he be like other grandfathers?

337
00:26:28,847 --> 00:26:30,547
You know, the sweet old guy who sits in a rocking chair

338
00:26:30,747 --> 00:26:35,247
And brings us presents and tells us
How smart and funny we are?

339
00:26:35,847 --> 00:26:39,047
Face it. We don't have a grandfather.
We have an ambassador.

340
00:26:39,647 --> 00:26:43,847
The best thing that's happened to us
since we've been here Is nearly being
run over by those 2 french boys. ****

341
00:26:46,547 --> 00:26:49,747
For once, you and i
Totally and completely agree.

342
00:26:52,447 --> 00:26:53,947
Maybe we can see them again.

343
00:26:54,347 --> 00:26:57,447
Hello? There's like a zillion people
In the city of par is

344
00:26:57,947 --> 00:27:02,047
What are you gonna do, Look in the yellow
pages under Cute parisian boys driving mopeds?

345
00:27:03,347 --> 00:27:06,947
No. Under le fleurs de champs.

346
00:27:07,447 --> 00:27:08,847
The flower shop!

347
00:27:09,547 --> 00:27:11,447
Do you prefer daisies or roses?

348
00:27:15,047 --> 00:27:19,047
Girls!
We're going to lose our lunch reservation.

349
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,047
- Sparkles?
- Mmm. Too risky.

350
00:27:24,047 --> 00:27:26,347
- Hat?
- Nix. Blocks your face.

351
00:27:27,247 --> 00:27:30,347
Gotta hand it to you, ally.
If we pull this off

352
00:27:32,147 --> 00:27:33,247
[bell rings]
Show time!

353
00:27:46,647 --> 00:27:48,547
Delivery for melanie porter?

354
00:27:48,847 --> 00:27:49,947
That's me.

355
00:28:00,147 --> 00:28:01,347
Ah, michel.

356
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:04,347
Jean. It is very nice to feel you.

357
00:28:06,847 --> 00:28:09,147
He means nice to meet you.

358
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:13,947
Between his english and your french,
I don't think you'll ever Fight about anything.

359
00:28:14,847 --> 00:28:16,347
Ally: hey, i have a great idea.

360
00:28:16,447 --> 00:28:18,447
Why don't you guys come to lunch with us?

361
00:28:19,047 --> 00:28:20,247
Hey! Awful!

362
00:28:21,647 --> 00:28:23,947
He means, awesome... I think.

363
00:28:26,047 --> 00:28:27,047
[both laugh]
Girls?

364
00:28:28,047 --> 00:28:29,647
Can we please?

365
00:28:29,747 --> 00:28:30,847
Who are they?

366
00:28:30,947 --> 00:28:32,147
Ally: jean.
Melanie: and michel.

367
00:28:33,347 --> 00:28:35,147
Is that supposed to mean something to me?

368
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:37,447
Oh, it should. They're coming to lunch with us.

369
00:28:38,247 --> 00:28:41,147
- I don't think that's a good - Ally: come on, jeremy,
We don't want to lose our reservations.

370
00:28:41,547 --> 00:28:42,647
Follow us.

371
00:28:49,547 --> 00:28:52,647
Michel: jean's father owns a boutique des fleurs.

372
00:28:53,147 --> 00:28:54,447
A flower shop. During spring break,

373
00:28:54,547 --> 00:28:57,847
We deliver flowers for him
So we can make money to buy new instruments.

374
00:28:58,047 --> 00:29:00,447
That's so cool. Do you guys have a band together?

375
00:29:00,547 --> 00:29:03,347
Yes. Me and 4 other guys. The video heads.

376
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:10,147
Doesn't anybody drink regular water here,
Like, from a sink?

377
00:29:10,847 --> 00:29:13,347
Only if you want to be, how you say,

378
00:29:13,547 --> 00:29:15,647
Talking to ralph on the big white phone?
Michel: ha ha ha.

379
00:29:16,847 --> 00:29:18,747
Do you like your school?

380
00:29:19,647 --> 00:29:21,847
Eh, once the rain comes, i am sad.

381
00:29:23,047 --> 00:29:25,247
Um, maybe we'd better stick to french.

382
00:29:26,847 --> 00:29:28,647
Wha...

383
00:29:29,547 --> 00:29:31,047
What?

384
00:29:33,947 --> 00:29:36,947
Melanie: that's so cool.
I can't believe you know the dizzy deans.

385
00:29:37,147 --> 00:29:40,347
I think the way they mix reggae and hip hop
Is totally original.

386
00:29:40,747 --> 00:29:43,047
Their lyrics are like, eh, poetry.

387
00:29:43,547 --> 00:29:44,647
Melanie: totally.

388
00:29:45,647 --> 00:29:49,047
Excuse me while i visit the boys' room, please.
Feeling kind of nauseous.

389
00:29:54,447 --> 00:29:56,247
Would the mademoiselle care to order?

390
00:29:56,847 --> 00:30:00,147
I'll have the chicken [speaks french]
With the sauce on the side [speaks french].

391
00:30:02,647 --> 00:30:04,647
[speaks french]
You cannot get the sauce on the side.

392
00:30:06,147 --> 00:30:07,447
- Why?
- Why?

393
00:30:07,747 --> 00:30:09,947
Because the chef will not allow it.

394
00:30:24,647 --> 00:30:25,847
What did he say?

395
00:30:25,847 --> 00:30:27,947
Uh, loosely translated, he said

396
00:30:28,947 --> 00:30:32,047
How dare you talk to that beautiful girl that way?"

397
00:30:33,447 --> 00:30:35,847
And, uh, he is a rear end of a flying baboon.

398
00:30:37,447 --> 00:30:39,947
That's the nicest thing
Anybody's ever done for me.

399
00:30:40,147 --> 00:30:42,847
Uh, it was, eh, anything.

400
00:30:44,547 --> 00:30:47,547
What you are seeing, this is not par is.

401
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:51,447
Come with us. We will show you the real par is.

402
00:30:52,247 --> 00:30:54,847
Uh, as you say, [speaking french]

403
00:30:56,347 --> 00:30:57,747
Ally: we're so there.

404
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,247
Melanie: let's go.

405
00:31:12,847 --> 00:31:15,647
"meet you in front of the embassy at 5:00.
Remember, leave a good tip." no!

406
00:31:15,847 --> 00:31:16,947
Jeremy: girls! Wait! Wait!

407
00:31:18,047 --> 00:31:20,247
Girls! Wait--wait!

408
00:31:21,947 --> 00:31:24,647
Hold on, girls!
Think of my career!

409
00:31:30,547 --> 00:31:31,647
I hate kids.

410
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:30,747
Where do you play?

411
00:32:31,147 --> 00:32:32,947
Uh, i come here sometimes.

412
00:32:33,447 --> 00:32:34,547
I love it!

413
00:32:45,647 --> 00:32:48,347
- Are you having fun?
- I'm having a blast.

414
00:33:18,847 --> 00:33:21,547
Melanie: we've been to so many museums,
It's all a big blur.

415
00:33:22,147 --> 00:33:25,947
I probably wouldn't be able to tell
The mona lisa from lisa simpson.

416
00:33:27,147 --> 00:33:30,247
Tourists race through the louvre
At 50 kilo meters an hour.

417
00:33:30,447 --> 00:33:32,647
You can't appreciate anything that way.

418
00:33:32,747 --> 00:33:37,547
Better to see one painting and really see it
Than to race by 100 in a blur.

419
00:33:39,847 --> 00:33:40,947
Wait.

420
00:33:41,347 --> 00:33:42,647
What's the hurry?

421
00:33:43,047 --> 00:33:46,147
You see, the artist uses light
To capture the emotion of the city.

422
00:33:48,347 --> 00:33:51,547
It feels like these col ors
Are what we wish we saw every day.

423
00:33:51,747 --> 00:33:52,947
Exactly.

424
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,747
It's not supposed to be realistic.

425
00:33:55,647 --> 00:33:56,847
It's emotion.

426
00:33:58,047 --> 00:33:59,847
That's what art is really about

427
00:34:00,447 --> 00:34:02,747
How you feel when you look at the painting.

428
00:34:10,247 --> 00:34:15,147
It's beautiful.
And this view is amazing.

429
00:34:15,547 --> 00:34:18,547
Paris is the most beautiful place i've ever seen..

430
00:34:21,347 --> 00:34:23,447
Now, this is real french food.

431
00:34:23,847 --> 00:34:26,147
Do they food you at the embassy? No?

432
00:34:26,747 --> 00:34:30,147
Um, yeah, they food us,
But nothing we can recognize.

433
00:34:31,147 --> 00:34:33,147
Ha ha. You're a funny girl, ally.

434
00:34:34,147 --> 00:34:36,747
You know, i could get used
To this language barrier thing.

435
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:44,647
Ally: this has been the coolest day.

436
00:34:44,747 --> 00:34:48,347
Yeah, thanks for showing us around.
We've had the greatest time.

437
00:34:48,547 --> 00:34:50,447
Time? Oh, my god, what time is it?

438
00:34:52,247 --> 00:34:53,247
Uh, 4:45.

439
00:34:53,347 --> 00:34:55,647
We're supposed to be home at 5:00.
We promised jeremy.

440
00:34:55,747 --> 00:34:58,747
We're on the other side of the city.
We'll never make it.

441
00:35:39,547 --> 00:35:42,247
- Are we almost there?
- Almost.

442
00:35:54,547 --> 00:35:56,347
- Both: thank you
- Bye.

443
00:35:56,747 --> 00:35:57,947
Thank you so much.

444
00:36:00,847 --> 00:36:02,447
- Both: thank you
- Bye.

445
00:36:02,447 --> 00:36:04,547
Oh, my god, that was so much fun.
Do you girls realize

446
00:36:07,047 --> 00:36:10,247
That i've been worried sick about you all day?

447
00:36:10,947 --> 00:36:13,947
My--my career would be down the toilet
If anything had happened to you.

448
00:36:14,147 --> 00:36:16,347
Jeremy, i didn't know you cared.
You've left me no choice

449
00:36:17,047 --> 00:36:20,447
But to let the ambassador know
What you've been up to today.

450
00:36:20,747 --> 00:36:22,047
Oh, good idea

451
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:24,247
I'm sure he won't be too upset
When he finds out

452
00:36:24,347 --> 00:36:27,847
you let us run around town
All day with 2 boys.

453
00:36:28,147 --> 00:36:31,147
- Ally: french boys.
- Teenage french boys.

454
00:36:33,147 --> 00:36:34,647
See you at dinner, J.

455
00:36:44,547 --> 00:36:46,447
So what did you learn today, girls?

456
00:36:47,547 --> 00:36:48,747
Mmm, not much.

457
00:36:51,847 --> 00:36:54,747
Oh, except did you know not re dame
Has an excellent support system

458
00:36:54,947 --> 00:36:56,447
Called the flying buttress?

459
00:36:56,747 --> 00:37:00,447
The builders practically invented The gothic
style of architecture In the 12th century.

460
00:37:01,047 --> 00:37:03,147
Could you pass the salt, please?

461
00:37:03,947 --> 00:37:06,847
Melanie: yeah. Most of the kings of franc e
Were crowned or married there.

462
00:37:07,047 --> 00:37:09,247
Did you know it took over 200 years to build?

463
00:37:09,447 --> 00:37:11,447
Guess they weren't in much of a hurry.

464
00:37:11,547 --> 00:37:13,747
Salad dressing, please, jeremy?

465
00:37:15,547 --> 00:37:16,947
Earth to j-man.

466
00:37:18,847 --> 00:37:21,947
Hmm? Oh, dressing. Right. Sure.
Dressing for you.

467
00:37:22,347 --> 00:37:25,447
Girls, you have indeed
Learned something today, haven't you?

468
00:37:25,847 --> 00:37:27,847
Yeah. And we owe it all to jeremy.

469
00:37:31,847 --> 00:37:34,547
We're supposed to meet the boys at 2:00 tomorrow.

470
00:37:34,647 --> 00:37:36,247
We're supposed to meet the boys at 2:00 tomorrow.

471
00:37:36,347 --> 00:37:40,847
Well, we can't keep ditching jeremy.
I'm actually kind of feeling bad for the bone-head.

472
00:37:41,447 --> 00:37:44,347
What we need is a plan.
A diversion.

473
00:37:45,947 --> 00:37:47,747
What we need is...

474
00:37:49,247 --> 00:37:50,247
I've got it.

475
00:38:00,747 --> 00:38:01,947
Perfect.

476
00:38:05,147 --> 00:38:08,047
- Good morning, o favorite tour guide of ours.
- Good morning.

477
00:38:08,547 --> 00:38:12,347
Look, girls, i appreciate That you made me look
good In front of the ambassador last night,

478
00:38:12,647 --> 00:38:15,847
But that does not give you license
To tick me off today, ok?

479
00:38:16,047 --> 00:38:18,647
- Who, us?
- What's the first stop of the day?

480
00:38:18,847 --> 00:38:21,847
Today, the rod in museum.

481
00:38:22,347 --> 00:38:24,447
No? Jardin de luxembourg.

482
00:38:25,247 --> 00:38:27,447
That's weird. I could have sworn

483
00:38:31,247 --> 00:38:34,747
This park sure is pretty.
Lots of beautiful things to look for.

484
00:38:35,047 --> 00:38:36,647
I mean, at.

485
00:38:37,547 --> 00:38:42,547
Uh, jeremy, isn't it a great day
I mean, to look outside in the nature and stuff?

486
00:38:43,147 --> 00:38:45,547
Yeah, it's terrific. My allergies are thrilled.

487
00:38:46,547 --> 00:38:47,747
Wait. Wait. Ah-choo!
Both: eww.

488
00:39:00,047 --> 00:39:03,347
Melanie: look, ally, it's brigitte,
The supermodel we met at the cafe.

489
00:39:03,647 --> 00:39:07,347
All right, you 2 girls are friends with a supermodel.

490
00:39:07,747 --> 00:39:09,047
Ally! Melanie!

491
00:39:13,547 --> 00:39:15,247
What a nice surprise. Mmm.

492
00:39:17,447 --> 00:39:19,347
Brigitte, this is jeremy bluff,

493
00:39:19,547 --> 00:39:23,047
Special assistant to our grandfather,
The u.s. Ambassador to franc e.

00:39:24,147 --> 00:39:26,247

Uh, jeremy. Call me jeremy.

498
00:39:33,847 --> 00:39:35,947
What a fascinating career you have, jeremy.

499
00:39:36,647 --> 00:39:39,347
Foreign diplomacy has always been an interest of mine.

500
00:39:39,547 --> 00:39:40,747
Jeremy: really? It's a very

501
00:39:40,947 --> 00:39:44,347
Fascinating and complex field, yeah.

502
00:39:44,547 --> 00:39:45,547
Really. That is why i did

503
00:39:45,747 --> 00:39:48,847
My postgraduate studies on international relations.

504
00:39:49,347 --> 00:39:50,547
Postgraduate work?

505
00:39:50,747 --> 00:39:54,547
I did my masters dissertation
On the middle east peace talks.

506
00:39:55,447 --> 00:39:58,247
My--my first posting was in saudi arabia.

507
00:39:59,247 --> 00:40:00,447
- Really?
- Yes.

508
00:40:01,347 --> 00:40:02,847
Jeremy: so the saudi prince says to me,

509
00:40:03,047 --> 00:40:07,747
We will sign the accord
If you teach us the mac arena.

510
00:40:08,247 --> 00:40:10,247
I can't believe she's even buying this stuff.

511
00:40:10,447 --> 00:40:11,847
So what did you do?

512
00:40:11,947 --> 00:40:13,247
Well, you know. [humming]

513
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:18,547
- Geek police had better make a citizen's arrest.
- You know, hey.

514
00:40:19,847 --> 00:40:21,247
Okay, Phase 2.

515
00:40:21,947 --> 00:40:25,147
Jeremy: so there i am, all alone
With the saudi prince and his barber.

516
00:40:25,347 --> 00:40:26,347
Uh, jeremy?

517
00:40:27,147 --> 00:40:31,347
We thought it might be fun If you went to
the south end Of ponte d'alexander at 2:00?

518
00:40:32,147 --> 00:40:35,847
- The ponte d'alexander.
- Ally: you know, a bridge built For the 1900 exhibition.

519
00:40:36,347 --> 00:40:38,447
It presents par is at its grandest.

520
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:42,147
Well, at least
That's what it says in the book.

521
00:40:42,547 --> 00:40:46,147
There wouldn't be 2 boys
Waiting at the other end of this bridge, would there?

522
00:40:46,647 --> 00:40:48,047
You met some boys.

523
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:50,447
Wow, you girls don't waste any time.

524
00:40:51,147 --> 00:40:52,747
I'm sorry. It's not on the itinerary.

525
00:40:52,847 --> 00:40:56,247
But, jeremy, if we don't show up,
Jean and michel Will think we stood them up.

526
00:40:56,547 --> 00:41:00,647
- Then what will they think of americans?
- Yeah, what kind of diplomat Are you, anyway?

527
00:41:01,147 --> 00:41:03,247
Yes, jeremy, what kind are you?

528
00:41:04,447 --> 00:41:06,447
The kind that caves, apparently.

529
00:41:09,847 --> 00:41:11,447
Ok. To the bridge.

530
00:41:18,247 --> 00:41:20,747
Michel: it's sad you don't see
your grandfather very much.

531
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:23,247
Melanie: yeah, but i don't think he's too disappointed.

532
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:26,447
- He kinda thinks we're a nuisance.
- "nuisance"?

533
00:41:27,547 --> 00:41:30,447
Uh, yeah. You know,
A pain in the butt.

534
00:41:32,247 --> 00:41:34,647
Paris used to have a swim competition here years ago,

535
00:41:34,847 --> 00:41:37,747
But it was canceled
because the seine was so polluted.

536
00:41:37,847 --> 00:41:40,647
That's why the water treaty is so important

537
00:41:40,747 --> 00:41:44,647
Force each country to clean up after itself.
You know, the regula

538
00:41:45,147 --> 00:41:47,847
I'm rambling about water issues.
Somebody get the hook.

539
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:52,247
No, no, no, no. I think it's wonderful
That you're so passionate about your work.

540
00:41:52,647 --> 00:41:56,847
Repeat after me
"that gee k is a total freak show."

541
00:41:59,247 --> 00:42:02,547
Zat gee k...
Is a total... Freak show.

542
00:42:02,647 --> 00:42:03,747
Great.

543
00:42:04,447 --> 00:42:07,647
A few more key phrases,
And you're ready for junior high in california.

544
00:42:08,347 --> 00:42:11,647
My father is a butcher.
All he ever talks about is meat.

545
00:42:12,147 --> 00:42:16,447
Lamb chops this, Pork chops that.
He wants me to take over his business one day.

546
00:42:16,847 --> 00:42:20,547
He thinks my music is a waste of time.
I'm afraid i disappoint him.

547
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:24,947
- But you can't stop playing if you love it.
- I told him it was important to me.

548
00:42:25,247 --> 00:42:27,447
He says, "you know what's important?

549
00:42:27,747 --> 00:42:30,547
"A nice file t mignon
that's what's important."

550
00:42:31,647 --> 00:42:35,847
Well, i guess it's the same in every country.
Adults, they just don't understand kids.

551
00:42:37,247 --> 00:42:41,247
Modeling is fun, but it's just a job
With a very short shelf life.

552
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,747
But next year, i'm going back to grad school

553
00:42:43,947 --> 00:42:46,847
To get my ph.d. In international relations.

554
00:42:47,047 --> 00:42:48,747
A supermodel and a scholar.

555
00:42:50,247 --> 00:42:52,447
You're a very impressive person, brigitte.

556
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:59,347
[giggling] Ah, american girls So different
from the french. They like to, uh... Larff.

557
00:43:00,647 --> 00:43:01,647
Rire.

558
00:43:05,647 --> 00:43:06,847
Oh. You mean "laugh."

559
00:43:06,847 --> 00:43:08,447
Oui. Laugh.

560
00:43:09,347 --> 00:43:11,047
They are funny, like you.

561
00:43:11,447 --> 00:43:14,447
Parisian girls,
They walk around like this...

562
00:43:19,147 --> 00:43:22,047
But the american girls,
They walk like this...

563
00:43:25,647 --> 00:43:26,847
Oh, my god!

564
00:43:35,847 --> 00:43:36,947
See?

565
00:43:38,847 --> 00:43:41,047
Paris is so romantic at any age.

566
00:43:43,047 --> 00:43:44,847
So you really speak 4 languages?

567
00:43:46,147 --> 00:43:49,147
5, with japanese,
But i'm really not that fluent.

568
00:44:01,647 --> 00:44:04,647
- Well, i have to get back to work.
- Ah, so dinner tomorrow night?

569
00:44:06,147 --> 00:44:07,347
8:00?

570
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:10,847
Ciao, jeremy.

571
00:44:12,847 --> 00:44:15,747
I'd say we've done you a pretty big favor, dr. J,

572
00:44:16,047 --> 00:44:17,147
Wouldn't you?

573
00:44:17,647 --> 00:44:20,547
Finding you a supermodel girlfriend and all that.

574
00:44:20,847 --> 00:44:22,947
Yeah. Wonder how you'll ever repay us.

575
00:44:31,747 --> 00:44:32,947
Girls.

576
00:44:36,547 --> 00:44:38,547
- Did you get it?
- I got it.

577
00:44:40,647 --> 00:44:44,547
- It's in the bag.
- Wait. Not so fast, j-man.

578
00:44:45,347 --> 00:44:47,747
- What?
- Make sure it's all there.

579
00:44:50,947 --> 00:44:53,847
2 large fries and 2 hamburgers.

580
00:44:54,047 --> 00:44:55,747
Wait. Where's my chocolate shake?

581
00:44:55,947 --> 00:44:58,147
Give me a break.
I ran out of money.

582
00:45:02,347 --> 00:45:03,847
I thought so.

583
00:45:07,547 --> 00:45:09,647
Le mickey donald?
In my kitchen? J'ai les vapeurs.

584
00:45:10,547 --> 00:45:11,647
I think i'm going to faint.

585
00:45:11,847 --> 00:45:14,047
We're sorry, henri. We were just so hungry.

586
00:45:14,647 --> 00:45:17,547
Have you ever even tried
A fast-food burger and fries?

587
00:45:19,147 --> 00:45:21,247
Moi? I'm henri. I was trained at the cordon bleu.

588
00:45:21,347 --> 00:45:23,547
I don't eat these--
Pfft-pfft-pfft-- fast food.

589
00:45:23,947 --> 00:45:27,847
You're too stuck in your own ways, henri.
You have to be more open-minded.

590
00:45:29,447 --> 00:45:32,247
Au contra ire.
It is you two who never want to try anything new.

591
00:45:32,447 --> 00:45:36,847
Americans are the most closed-minded.
Eh, just look at this one.

592
00:45:38,647 --> 00:45:40,947
Ok, we'll make you a deal, henri.

593
00:45:42,047 --> 00:45:45,747
We'll try one of your concoctions
If you try one of ours.

594
00:45:46,047 --> 00:45:47,247
We will?

595
00:45:49,447 --> 00:45:51,047
Bon. You have a deal.

596
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:56,147
Quail eggs with artichoke.

597
00:45:58,347 --> 00:46:00,947
Ze hamburger...
And ze fries.

598
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:08,747
On the count of 3.

599
00:46:09,747 --> 00:46:10,847
One...

600
00:46:13,947 --> 00:46:15,047
2...

601
00:46:19,147 --> 00:46:20,247
Deux... Wait.

602
00:46:21,647 --> 00:46:25,247
It's called a hamburger.
You have to use your hands.

603
00:46:34,147 --> 00:46:35,247
One...

604
00:46:38,247 --> 00:46:39,247
2...

605
00:46:42,147 --> 00:46:43,347
Trois.

606
00:46:49,947 --> 00:46:51,147
Mmm! Not bad.

607
00:46:52,447 --> 00:46:55,747
Ah. Tu le vois? I told you,
French cuisine is the most exquisite in the world.

608
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,147
Henri has a very refined palate.

609
00:46:58,247 --> 00:47:01,647
[talking with mouth full] i don't understand
How people eat

610
00:47:02,347 --> 00:47:04,447
this rubbish junk...
This trash...

611
00:47:05,247 --> 00:47:06,447
Here, henri.

612
00:47:07,547 --> 00:47:09,247
Try it with this.
Ketchup.

613
00:47:10,947 --> 00:47:12,047
Trust me.

614
00:47:21,347 --> 00:47:23,747
Thanks for taking us out for the shakes.

615
00:47:23,847 --> 00:47:25,847
Oh, i kinda got a craving for one myself.

616
00:47:28,247 --> 00:47:30,447
Mmm!
I forgot how good these things are.

617
00:47:32,147 --> 00:47:35,047
So, why do you always look so miserable, j-man?

618
00:47:35,547 --> 00:47:38,447
Yeah. Why do you stick around the embassy
If you hate it so much?

619
00:47:38,847 --> 00:47:39,947
Oh, i don't hate it.

620
00:47:42,347 --> 00:47:46,247
I've been in embassy operations for 3 years.

621
00:47:46,547 --> 00:47:49,847
I can't seem to get your grandfather
To take me seriously,

622
00:47:50,047 --> 00:47:52,347
You know, move me up to a policy position.

623
00:47:52,547 --> 00:47:53,747
That's rough.

624
00:47:54,547 --> 00:47:58,247
It's sort a like when i wanted
My mom and dad to move me up to a pg-13 movie.

625
00:47:58,647 --> 00:48:02,047
They wouldn't take me seriously
Until i proved to them

626
00:48:02,247 --> 00:48:04,047
That i was old enough to handle it.

627
00:48:04,247 --> 00:48:05,447
How'd you do that?

628
00:48:05,647 --> 00:48:07,647
Well, i acted real mature.

629
00:48:07,947 --> 00:48:10,947
And when that didn't work...
I whined.

630
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:13,647
A lot. They cracked like an egg.

631
00:48:15,347 --> 00:48:17,447
Much. They melted in an instant.

632
00:48:18,347 --> 00:48:19,547
Do i have a choice?

633
00:48:19,747 --> 00:48:22,747
Hey. Desperate times call for desperate measures.

634
00:48:23,647 --> 00:48:24,647
Shoot.

635
00:48:26,047 --> 00:48:27,447
Ok. Well, around us,

636
00:48:27,747 --> 00:48:30,947
You're always in control and bossy and stuff.

637
00:48:31,247 --> 00:48:33,047
But around grandpa, you're a...

638
00:48:35,147 --> 00:48:37,047
- A... Chicken.
- Thanks. That's it.

639
00:48:37,747 --> 00:48:41,247
All i'm saying is you gotta stand up for yourself
And get a big mouth like...

640
00:48:43,047 --> 00:48:44,447
- Melanie.
- Yeah, like me.

641
00:48:46,947 --> 00:48:49,047
- Wait. What?
- Gotcha.

642
00:49:09,247 --> 00:49:10,747
[techno music playing loudly]
Here are the forms, monsieur.

643
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:15,147
Merci, françois.
And, uh, tell the girls to turn that noise off.

644
00:49:22,447 --> 00:49:24,447
Oui, oui, monsieur.

645
00:49:26,647 --> 00:49:28,247
What in blazes is this?

646
00:49:29,747 --> 00:49:31,447
French fries.

647
00:49:42,147 --> 00:49:44,047
Bon appetit, monsieur.
The whole staff has gone batty.

648
00:49:55,647 --> 00:49:57,647
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning, J.

649
00:49:57,747 --> 00:49:59,547
So what's the itinerary for today?

650
00:49:59,547 --> 00:50:00,847
Itinerary.

651
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:10,247
- What do you wanna do today?
- Shopping!

652
00:50:10,947 --> 00:50:12,447
I don't do shopping.

653
00:50:15,847 --> 00:50:17,447
I do shopping. Yeah.
[sugar by stretch princess playing] Pose là.

654
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:01,947
Oh, that would be great. And this one

655
00:51:02,747 --> 00:51:03,947
this one for you.

656
00:51:27,147 --> 00:51:28,347
Ok. Let's change.

657
00:51:29,047 --> 00:51:32,547
Fashion show.
1, 2, 3, Attitude.

658
00:51:33,647 --> 00:51:35,147
Attitude.

659
00:51:35,347 --> 00:51:36,947
And then we turn.

660
00:51:38,747 --> 00:51:42,447
Attitude. Like that.

661
00:51:47,947 --> 00:51:49,447
Photo!

662
00:51:54,647 --> 00:51:55,947
[camera shutter clicking]
Ok. Let's go.

663
00:51:57,847 --> 00:51:59,247
Attitude always.

664
00:52:05,647 --> 00:52:07,547
The dinner menu, monsieur.

665
00:52:08,547 --> 00:52:10,947
The menu's fine. Thank you, françois.

666
00:52:11,147 --> 00:52:13,347
And make sure the girls are on time for dinner.

667
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:18,447
The mademoiselles are very tired
And wish to be excused

668
00:52:22,447 --> 00:52:23,547
monsieur ambassador.

669
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:49,147
Get out ta here with your bad mademoiselle self.

670
00:52:51,947 --> 00:52:55,247
- Look. They're coming.
- Remember the true test.

671
00:52:55,947 --> 00:52:57,647
Can they tell us apart

672
00:52:57,847 --> 00:53:00,447
If not, it wasn't meant to be.

673
00:53:07,247 --> 00:53:08,747
- Hi, melanie.
- Ally.

674
00:53:12,947 --> 00:53:16,747
I am so glad you were able to,
How you say, sneak out?

675
00:53:17,047 --> 00:53:19,047
And you almost made it.

676
00:53:20,247 --> 00:53:21,947
Girls, where are you going?

677
00:53:23,347 --> 00:53:26,947
Uh, jean and michel were just showing us
Where to pick up some...

678
00:53:27,547 --> 00:53:28,747
Tea for grandpa.

679
00:53:29,347 --> 00:53:30,447
See ya later.

680
00:53:30,647 --> 00:53:34,647
Really? Well... I'll just call him
And see if there's anything else he might need.

681
00:53:35,047 --> 00:53:38,047
Ok, ok. Jean and michel invited us to dinner.

682
00:53:38,247 --> 00:53:39,847
Way to hang tough, ally.

683
00:53:40,047 --> 00:53:43,247
We didn't ask for grandpa's permission
Because we knew he'd say no.

684
00:53:43,347 --> 00:53:46,347
- He just doesn't understand...
- How important this is to us.

685
00:53:51,747 --> 00:53:53,647
Hello, françois. This is jeremy.

686
00:53:53,747 --> 00:53:55,347
Please tell the ambassador...

687
00:53:58,647 --> 00:54:00,947
That i have taken the girls out for an ice cream.

688
00:54:05,147 --> 00:54:07,947
- So where are you taking them?
- Our favorite restaurant.

689
00:54:08,647 --> 00:54:10,447
Secret place.

690
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,747
Secret place?
Great. Great.

691
00:54:13,447 --> 00:54:17,147
You be at the place de la concord e
In 3 hours.

692
00:54:17,647 --> 00:54:21,447
I'm holding you two personally responsible.
No excuses. Comprenez-vous?

693
00:54:23,447 --> 00:54:24,647
You have to worry.

694
00:54:25,447 --> 00:54:28,047
He means you don't have to worry.
We promise.

695
00:54:28,347 --> 00:54:29,447
Thanks, J.

696
00:54:30,147 --> 00:54:31,447
3 hours.

697
00:54:35,947 --> 00:54:38,747
I thought we were going
To the eiffel tower for dinner.

698
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:40,147
And so we are.

699
00:54:41,347 --> 00:54:43,747
- This is amazing.
- It's beautiful.

700
00:54:46,147 --> 00:54:49,647
- This is your secret place.
- You can see for miles.

701
00:54:51,147 --> 00:54:52,547
This is incredible.

702
00:54:54,047 --> 00:54:57,947
Mademoiselles,
Welcome to restaurant jean-michel.

703
00:55:00,147 --> 00:55:01,347
Table for 4.

704
00:55:02,447 --> 00:55:05,547
Angela and i were together for 3 years.

705
00:55:06,847 --> 00:55:10,847
I don't know if i was afraid of commitment
Or if she was just the wrong person,

706
00:55:11,247 --> 00:55:13,047
But i buried myself in my work.

707
00:55:14,047 --> 00:55:15,747
Finally, she got fed up with me.

708
00:55:15,947 --> 00:55:20,347
She ran off with some guy
She met at a club med in the bahamas.

709
00:55:22,247 --> 00:55:23,947
Violins, please.

710
00:55:24,047 --> 00:55:26,047
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- Oh, don't be.

711
00:55:27,347 --> 00:55:29,047
So, what about you?

712
00:55:30,647 --> 00:55:33,547
- What about me?
- Oh, please. Come on.

713
00:55:33,947 --> 00:55:38,547
A well-educated, gorgeous supermodel--
Unattached.

714
00:55:39,347 --> 00:55:41,047
There's a story there.

715
00:55:42,647 --> 00:55:44,047
There was someone.

716
00:55:45,347 --> 00:55:46,747
We were engaged.

717
00:55:48,047 --> 00:55:49,947
Ooh. The plot thickens.

718
00:55:51,947 --> 00:55:55,447
He was a grand prix driver
Traveling all around the world.

719
00:55:56,847 --> 00:55:58,747
And i was a fashion model doing the same.

720
00:56:00,147 --> 00:56:02,647
One day, i saw a picture in the tabloid.

721
00:56:03,247 --> 00:56:05,947
It said we were the most romantic couple in the world.

722
00:56:06,647 --> 00:56:08,247
Doesn't sound so bad.

723
00:56:09,047 --> 00:56:13,447
We never even spent more than 3 days together.
Some romance.

724
00:56:16,147 --> 00:56:19,247
Neither one of us wanted to compromise our careers,

725
00:56:19,447 --> 00:56:22,147
- So...
- So here we are,

726
00:56:22,447 --> 00:56:25,447
2 uncompromising workaholics

727
00:56:26,447 --> 00:56:28,947
Who can't make a relationship work.

728
00:56:31,247 --> 00:56:33,647
You know what?
Jeremy, the truth is...

729
00:56:34,347 --> 00:56:38,047
That every relationship is hard,
But people want to make it work.

730
00:56:44,247 --> 00:56:47,547
The gelati looks delicious.
Do you want to split a chocolat?

731
00:56:47,947 --> 00:56:50,647
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm more of a vanilla kind of guy.

732
00:56:53,547 --> 00:56:54,947
I love chocolat.

733
00:56:58,647 --> 00:57:00,047
So what shall we do?

734
00:57:02,547 --> 00:57:05,747
One chocolate gelati, please...

735
00:57:15,747 --> 00:57:18,647
Melanie: the lights of par is are so unbelievable.

736
00:57:19,847 --> 00:57:21,347
It takes my breath away.

737
00:57:22,347 --> 00:57:25,147
- Are you feeling sick?
- No. It's just an expression.

738
00:57:29,047 --> 00:57:30,047
Melanie,

739
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:33,447
our band, the video heads,
Are playing tomorrow night at a dance.

740
00:57:33,647 --> 00:57:34,847
Yes?

741
00:57:35,647 --> 00:57:38,147
- Would you like to go with me?
- Of course.

742
00:57:39,847 --> 00:57:43,047
That sounds awesome.
I'd love to go to the dance with you.

743
00:57:45,347 --> 00:57:47,747
We're happy for to go you.

744
00:57:48,847 --> 00:57:50,747
I actually understand your english.

745
00:57:55,947 --> 00:57:57,147
What?

746
00:57:57,247 --> 00:58:01,047
Well, when we were 9,
Ally and i went to disneyland for the first time.

747
00:58:01,547 --> 00:58:04,847
And i thought, this was the best day of my life.

748
00:58:06,047 --> 00:58:08,947
I didn't think life could get any better.

749
00:58:12,847 --> 00:58:15,247
Mmm! This chocolate eclair is très magnifique.

750
00:58:17,547 --> 00:58:18,847
What? What's so funny?

751
00:58:28,947 --> 00:58:31,847
What do you mean off limits?
There is no sign anywhere.

752
00:58:36,247 --> 00:58:37,547
Melanie: what does it say?

753
00:58:38,247 --> 00:58:39,747
No trespassing.

754
00:58:41,047 --> 00:58:43,747
Violators will be... Executed.

755
00:58:44,747 --> 00:58:45,947
Prosecuted.

756
00:58:47,147 --> 00:58:48,847
I'm not sure which one is worse.

757
00:58:54,947 --> 00:58:56,347
Anything?

758
00:58:58,547 --> 00:59:00,447
I'd better call the ambassador.

759
00:59:01,847 --> 00:59:04,047
How could you be so irresponsible, jeremy?

760
00:59:05,147 --> 00:59:08,347
Look, you want me to trust you?
Where are my granddaughters?

761
00:59:10,147 --> 00:59:13,947
Sir, all i can do is apologize
And say i am so... Sorry.

762
00:59:14,147 --> 00:59:15,647
- I thought ...
- You're sorry.

763
00:59:20,047 --> 00:59:23,147
I don't know what came over me.
How could i have been so stupid?

764
00:59:23,447 --> 00:59:26,347
It wasn't stupid.
It was romantic and sweet.

765
00:59:26,547 --> 00:59:28,747
- If anything happens to those girls
- No, no, no, no.

766
00:59:28,947 --> 00:59:31,747
They're fine, jeremy.
Woman's intuition.

767
00:59:32,847 --> 00:59:33,847
Ok.

768
00:59:43,847 --> 00:59:45,047
Thank god.

769
00:59:47,147 --> 00:59:48,847
Guess what? We got a ride home.

770
00:59:51,047 --> 00:59:52,547
Um... are we in trouble?

771
00:59:53,147 --> 00:59:54,347
Yes, we are.

772
00:59:55,647 --> 00:59:59,847
Allyson, melanie,
I'm very disappointed in you.

773
01:00:00,947 --> 01:00:02,647
As united states ambassador to franc e,

774
01:00:02,847 --> 01:00:06,147
I cannot have my granddaughters
Being hauled into police headquarters,

775
01:00:06,247 --> 01:00:09,447
Gallivanting around par is
With 2 delinquent little french boys.

776
01:00:09,747 --> 01:00:13,047
- But, grandpa, you don't even know them.
- Sir, if i might say one thing

777
01:00:13,147 --> 01:00:14,747
I will deal with you later.

778
01:00:15,147 --> 01:00:16,447
No, sir.

779
01:00:16,747 --> 01:00:18,947
No, sir. You'll deal with me now.

780
01:00:22,047 --> 01:00:24,147
Ally and melanie don't deserve this.

781
01:00:24,847 --> 01:00:27,147
Your granddaughters are 2 terrific kids

782
01:00:27,347 --> 01:00:29,547
Who came to par is to have fun.

783
01:00:29,847 --> 01:00:32,547
And they met 2 boys
Who introduced them to

784
01:00:32,747 --> 01:00:36,247
the crazy, fun par is
That you once knew yourself

785
01:00:36,547 --> 01:00:37,647
edward.

786
01:00:39,347 --> 01:00:43,247
Ally and melanie are so smart,
So fun, So full of life.

787
01:00:43,947 --> 01:00:48,447
You could find that out for yourself, sir,
If you would just take the time To get to know them.

788
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:53,647
You are very close to insubordination, young man.

789
01:00:55,047 --> 01:00:56,847
Well, i'm about to get a little closer.

790
01:00:57,847 --> 01:01:00,747
I gave you my position paper
On the water treaty a week ago.

791
01:01:01,047 --> 01:01:02,647
You have yet to read it.

792
01:01:04,047 --> 01:01:06,047
I have something to offer here,

793
01:01:06,847 --> 01:01:10,347
But i see now that my contribution
Is falling on deaf ears.

794
01:01:11,847 --> 01:01:14,547
So, mr. Ambassador,
With all due respect,

795
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,947
What?
Jeremy, you can't.

796
01:01:17,347 --> 01:01:20,047
- Jeremy, you can't.
- Melanie: not because of us.

797
01:01:20,947 --> 01:01:22,147
No, no.

798
01:01:23,247 --> 01:01:24,647
Thank you both

799
01:01:24,747 --> 01:01:28,047
You've given me the courage
To do what i should've done months ago.

800
01:01:39,447 --> 01:01:40,647
Shall we?

801
01:01:44,047 --> 01:01:48,247
You are forbidden to see those boys ever again.

802
01:01:48,447 --> 01:01:49,547
Is that understood?

803
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:51,747
- But, grandpa...
- End of discussion..

804
01:02:08,947 --> 01:02:10,647
- Mel?
- I heard it.

805
01:02:15,547 --> 01:02:17,547
Sounds like a rock on the window.

806
01:02:19,347 --> 01:02:21,147
A rock on the window.

807
01:02:29,747 --> 01:02:32,447
What are you doing here?
How'd you guys get past the guards?

808
01:02:32,647 --> 01:02:35,447
Those marines?
Nice guys. Oh, we're very sorry

809
01:02:36,647 --> 01:02:40,847
- For getting you in trouble.
- Don't worry about it. It all worked out ok.

810
01:02:42,147 --> 01:02:43,547
Except...

811
01:02:44,347 --> 01:02:45,947
Ally: we have some bad news.

812
01:02:46,247 --> 01:02:48,647
We can't go to the dance with you
Tomorrow night.

813
01:02:48,847 --> 01:02:51,047
Melanie: you guys should invite someone else.

814
01:02:52,347 --> 01:02:55,647
Michel: never.
Either we go with melanie and ally son

815
01:02:55,947 --> 01:02:57,647
Or we go alone. Right, jean?

816
01:02:57,747 --> 01:02:58,847
Right!

817
01:03:03,547 --> 01:03:05,147
Ally: it's not just the dance.

818
01:03:06,447 --> 01:03:08,047
We can't see you any more.

819
01:03:08,947 --> 01:03:12,247
- What? You can't see us again?
- Jean: ever?

820
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,947
Man: hello? Who is out there?

821
01:03:15,247 --> 01:03:18,447
You guys better go.
We don't want you getting into any more trouble.

822
01:03:25,847 --> 01:03:27,447
Good-bye, beautiful girls.

823
01:03:32,347 --> 01:03:33,947
Don't forget us.

824
01:04:05,247 --> 01:04:08,447
"mercury content"?
"parts per billion"?

825
01:04:09,447 --> 01:04:11,247
Do you understand this stuff?

826
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:15,047
- I didn't know jeremy was this smart.
- He hides it well.

827
01:04:17,147 --> 01:04:18,547
May i come in?

828
01:04:19,747 --> 01:04:20,847
Come in.

829
01:04:22,347 --> 01:04:24,947
We just thought we'd get a jump-start on packing.

830
01:04:25,047 --> 01:04:26,247
I see.

831
01:04:28,047 --> 01:04:29,547
Do you mind if i sit down?

832
01:04:30,247 --> 01:04:31,247
Sure.

833
01:04:35,847 --> 01:04:37,047
Girls, um...

834
01:04:38,247 --> 01:04:39,947
I want to apologize.

835
01:04:41,447 --> 01:04:43,147
Now, what you did was wrong...

836
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:48,147
But perhaps i deserve some of the blame.
I should've spent more time with you this week.

837
01:04:49,847 --> 01:04:52,847
Believe me, i understand
That par is has a certain allure,

838
01:04:53,547 --> 01:04:55,347
A way of making you wannabe spontaneous.

839
01:04:55,547 --> 01:04:56,847
spontaneous.

840
01:04:57,747 --> 01:05:00,647
I remember.
I met your grandmother here. Did you know?

841
01:05:01,347 --> 01:05:02,547
Really?

842
01:05:04,047 --> 01:05:07,347
At the end of world war ii,

843
01:05:09,547 --> 01:05:13,647
I was a soldier stationed here in par is,
And your grandmother was a nurse.

844
01:05:14,647 --> 01:05:18,347
And when the war was over,
I was afraid that i'd never see her again.

845
01:05:20,347 --> 01:05:22,347
I'd only known her a few short weeks...

846
01:05:23,947 --> 01:05:28,547
But i spent every last franc that i had
To take her on a boat ride down the seine.

847
01:05:30,647 --> 01:05:32,947
She thought i was saying good-bye.

848
01:05:35,147 --> 01:05:37,647
Just as we passed under the pont neuf...

849
01:05:39,447 --> 01:05:41,347
I asked her to marry me.

850
01:05:43,247 --> 01:05:44,647
And she said yes, and, uh...

851
01:05:47,247 --> 01:05:49,347
We were together for 45 years.

852
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:53,847
You never told us that story before.

853
01:05:56,447 --> 01:06:00,147
Well, i guess we haven't done much talking in the past,
Have we?

854
01:06:01,747 --> 01:06:05,647
Look, before i forget,
These are for you.

855
01:06:08,747 --> 01:06:11,447
I thought you might need
Something nice to wear for tonight.

856
01:06:11,647 --> 01:06:14,847
Both: they're beautiful.
Thank you.

857
01:06:15,147 --> 01:06:16,747
Oh, you're welcome.

858
01:06:19,147 --> 01:06:21,747
Well, this is our last night together,

859
01:06:22,347 --> 01:06:25,147
So, uh, let's enjoy it and make up for lost time.
What do you say?

860
01:06:25,447 --> 01:06:26,847
- Sure.
- Ok.

861
01:06:28,647 --> 01:06:29,847
Grandpa?

862
01:06:31,147 --> 01:06:33,847
Why is this dinner so important to you?

863
01:06:34,147 --> 01:06:35,347
Well

864
01:06:35,847 --> 01:06:39,647
let's just say that there are some people
Who think that it's time for me to retire.

865
01:06:40,647 --> 01:06:42,847
- Don't you want to retire?
- Me?

866
01:06:43,747 --> 01:06:44,847
And do what?

867
01:06:45,047 --> 01:06:47,847
Besides, there's a lot of fight
Left in your old grandpa.

868
01:06:48,047 --> 01:06:49,647
I'll see you downstairs.

869
01:06:53,647 --> 01:06:56,147
So, the tin man has a heart after all.

870
01:06:59,647 --> 01:07:03,347
Melanie: it was our last night in par is
But our first official state dinner.

871
01:07:03,547 --> 01:07:06,747
Grandpa was hosting this shindig
For the french foreign minister

872
01:07:07,047 --> 01:07:08,947
And a lot of other very important people.

873
01:07:24,847 --> 01:07:26,047
Can i get you some champagne?
Uh-uh. Here they come.

874
01:07:26,647 --> 01:07:30,347
Monsieur foreign minister de bouvoir,
Madame de bouvoir,

875
01:07:30,947 --> 01:07:34,147
My granddaughters
Mademoiselles melanie and ally son porter.

876
01:07:37,647 --> 01:07:39,247
Enchanté, mademoiselles.

877
01:07:40,047 --> 01:07:43,247
Nice to meet you.

878
01:07:43,547 --> 01:07:45,447
This is their first trip to par is.

879
01:07:45,447 --> 01:07:48,447
Really?
And how do you like our fair city?

880
01:07:51,747 --> 01:07:54,247
Edward, she is a gem.

881
01:07:54,447 --> 01:07:57,547
And where did she learn to speak
Such excellent french?

882
01:07:57,947 --> 01:08:01,247
I suppose that was the n م
Not in one of your american schools, i trust.

883
01:08:04,347 --> 01:08:06,247
What is this, a hamburger?

884
01:08:06,347 --> 01:08:09,647
Non, non, non, monsieur le ministre.
It's a new delicacy i call bouef melanie.

885
01:08:10,747 --> 01:08:11,947
Uh-huh.

886
01:08:20,547 --> 01:08:24,347
Mmm! C'est delicieux. A truly unique creation.
Bravo, henri.

887
01:08:40,347 --> 01:08:43,447
Melanie: grandpa was doing his best
To convince the foreign minister

888
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:46,747
That franc e should sign the clean water treaty.

889
01:08:48,147 --> 01:08:50,247
But he wasn't having much luck.

890
01:08:59,847 --> 01:09:02,347
He doesn't think his government should sign.

891
01:09:02,647 --> 01:09:05,247
We've got to do something
To help grandpa.

892
01:09:07,847 --> 01:09:09,147
François.

893
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:22,447
Grandpa: i understand your concerns,
Mr. Foreign minister

894
01:09:22,647 --> 01:09:24,947
but we believe
The treaty benefits both of our countries.

895
01:09:25,147 --> 01:09:27,947
I would like to be able to help you, my friend,

896
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:32,747
But we are unconvinced
That it is in our national interest.

897
01:09:32,947 --> 01:09:35,347
So we will speak no more about it.

898
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:43,547
Edward, What is the meaning of this?

899
01:09:43,747 --> 01:09:46,847
I'm certain i have no idea, mr. Foreign minister.

900
01:09:47,747 --> 01:09:50,547
- Who is responsible for this?
- We are.

901
01:09:52,047 --> 01:09:54,147
You better have an explanation, young ladies.
We do.

902
01:09:54,347 --> 01:09:57,447
And it's a very good one.
Take it away, me l.

903
01:09:58,547 --> 01:09:59,547
Me?

904
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:04,347
You watch all those legal shows.
Time for closing argument. Well, sir,

905
01:10:07,747 --> 01:10:12,647
France has always prided itself At being
at the cutting edge Of water technology.

906
01:10:13,747 --> 01:10:15,147
And, uh...

907
01:10:16,247 --> 01:10:17,447
Stuff.

908
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:21,647
Napoleon bonaparte built aqueducts And
a modern sewer system So franc e would

909
01:10:21,847 --> 01:10:24,547
have the most happening
Water system in the world.

910
01:10:24,847 --> 01:10:26,147
I had no idea!

911
01:10:26,247 --> 01:10:28,947
What do sewers have to do with anything?

912
01:10:31,447 --> 01:10:34,247
Well, it's not so much the sewers,
Monsieur de beauvoir,

913
01:10:34,547 --> 01:10:36,447
But what they represent.

914
01:10:36,747 --> 01:10:39,047
Napoleon understood national pride,

915
01:10:39,247 --> 01:10:42,747
And the parisians Used to drink out of
fountains And swim in the seine for fun.

916
01:10:43,047 --> 01:10:44,747
But... Not any more.

917
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:48,547
Every time we ask for water in par is,
It comes in a bottle.

918
01:10:49,247 --> 01:10:52,447
I mean, hello?
Is this the kind of world We want to live in?

919
01:10:52,947 --> 01:10:55,847
Is this the kind of water
We want to drink?

920
01:10:56,247 --> 01:10:59,547
Where the mercury content
Is 27 parts per billion.

921
01:10:59,647 --> 01:11:01,647
And it makes you glow in the dark.

922
01:11:02,147 --> 01:11:03,747
I don't think so. Jinx!

923
01:11:07,147 --> 01:11:09,747
- Allyson. Melanie.
- Both: thanks.

924
01:11:10,047 --> 01:11:11,947
Soi ask you, ladies and gentlemen,

925
01:11:12,147 --> 01:11:14,347
What cost is too high
When your health

926
01:11:14,447 --> 01:11:16,947
And your place in history
Are at stake?

927
01:11:26,947 --> 01:11:29,947
Edward, I am sorry to report

928
01:11:31,247 --> 01:11:34,247
Your granddaughters are more persuasive
Than you are.

929
01:11:37,547 --> 01:11:41,747
Ah, bravo, young ladies.
Your esprit, your élan, your spirit.

930
01:11:41,947 --> 01:11:45,447
We do not have this kind of passion
Amongst our young people these days.

931
01:11:51,247 --> 01:11:53,747
Edward, I have decided to reconsider.

932
01:11:54,647 --> 01:11:58,347
I will petition my government
To sign onto the clean water treaty.

933
01:12:13,547 --> 01:12:16,547
François, Water for everyone.

934
01:12:21,747 --> 01:12:23,047
It was a wonderful evening.

935
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:27,547
Edward, my friend, Thank you for the most
entertaining evening I have had in years.

936
01:12:28,647 --> 01:12:32,247
And these girls.
They are gems. Both of them.

937
01:12:32,547 --> 01:12:37,547
Come, madame de beauvoir,
Before i come to my senses And change my mind.

938
01:12:47,847 --> 01:12:49,847
Where are you two off to in such a hurry?

939
01:12:50,047 --> 01:12:51,947
Uh, we still have a lot of packing to do.

940
01:12:52,347 --> 01:12:53,447
Really?

941
01:12:55,347 --> 01:12:58,147
Because i was under the impression
You had a dance to attend.

942
01:12:58,447 --> 01:13:00,947
- Unless you're too tired.
- Both: no!

943
01:13:01,447 --> 01:13:03,047
Both: thanks, grandpa.

944
01:13:03,747 --> 01:13:04,947
Let's go get ready.

945
01:13:04,947 --> 01:13:06,847
Hurry, girls. I'll take you myself.
Melanie: come on, grandpa.

946
01:13:07,547 --> 01:13:09,247
Allyson: let's stick our heads out the top.

947
01:13:09,447 --> 01:13:13,147
Grandpa: now, girls, as an ambassador,
I cannot ride around With my head stuck out of a

948
01:13:13,447 --> 01:13:14,647
Yahoo!

949
01:13:17,947 --> 01:13:21,347
- Melanie: now this is sightseeing.
- Allyson: wave, grandpa.

950
01:13:33,447 --> 01:13:35,747
Isn't par is gorgeous at night, grandpa?

951
01:13:36,847 --> 01:13:38,347
Mm-hmm. I'd almost forgotten.

952
01:14:15,047 --> 01:14:16,447
- Jeremy?
- Brigitte?

953
01:14:17,447 --> 01:14:18,847
What are you guys doing here?

954
01:14:19,047 --> 01:14:22,847
This is jeremy's last chance to chaperone
Before he starts his new job.

955
01:14:22,947 --> 01:14:24,747
- Job?
- What new job?

956
01:14:24,947 --> 01:14:27,847
As senior policy advisor
To the american ambassador.

957
01:14:28,347 --> 01:14:30,547
- It seems i've been rehired.
- It seems i've been rehired.

958
01:14:30,747 --> 01:14:32,847
Give it up for the j-man.

959
01:14:34,247 --> 01:14:35,447
- Hi, melanie.
- Hi.

960
01:14:35,547 --> 01:14:37,847
- Hi, Ally.
- May i have this dance?

961
01:14:42,347 --> 01:14:44,947
- Oh, i'm not very good at this.
- Oh, yes, you are.

962
01:14:57,247 --> 01:14:59,347
I don't know
When i'll see you again, melanie.

963
01:14:59,547 --> 01:15:02,647
Well, when the video heads get famous,
Maybe you'll tour l.a.

964
01:15:05,247 --> 01:15:09,547
- I'll e-mail you every day.
- I'll e-mail you twice a day.

965
01:15:10,247 --> 01:15:12,647
3 times a day, and that's my final offer.

966
01:15:14,547 --> 01:15:17,047
I'll miss you, funny girl.

967
01:15:17,647 --> 01:15:19,147
I'll miss you, too.

968
01:15:25,547 --> 01:15:27,347
When you said we'd see the real par is,

969
01:15:27,447 --> 01:15:30,147
I didn't know you meant
The police headquarters.

970
01:15:30,347 --> 01:15:32,947
I wish you did not have to leave tomorrow.

971
01:15:40,047 --> 01:15:41,747
To be young and in love.

972
01:15:42,647 --> 01:15:44,247
Oh, but i am, mademoiselle.

973
01:16:21,747 --> 01:16:24,247
Ally, melanie,
You don't want to miss your flight.

974
01:16:24,947 --> 01:16:28,347
I have specially prepared a paté as an appetizer,

975
01:16:28,747 --> 01:16:32,347
and A quiche lorraine
As an entrée for your flight.

976
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:36,147
- It's just eggs. You'll like it.
- Thank you, henri.

977
01:16:36,347 --> 01:16:38,047
- Yeah, thanks.
- Now you tell them,

978
01:16:38,147 --> 01:16:39,747
My quiche lorraine must be served

979
01:16:39,747 --> 01:16:42,947
At precisely 114 degrees centigrade or...

980
01:16:43,247 --> 01:16:44,647
All is lost?

981
01:16:55,847 --> 01:17:00,147
I will certainly miss
Your food projectiles, mademoiselles.

982
01:17:01,547 --> 01:17:04,547
- A tout l'heure, girls.
- A tout l'heure, françois. 10:00 a.m.

983
01:17:06,247 --> 01:17:08,247
And toodle-loo to you, too.

984
01:17:09,147 --> 01:17:11,147
Well, girls, we better get going.

985
01:17:11,847 --> 01:17:13,447
That's all right, jeremy.

986
01:17:13,647 --> 01:17:16,947
I think their grandfather ought to take them
To the airport, don't you?

987
01:17:17,247 --> 01:17:19,447
- I'll wait for you in the car, girls.
- Ok.

988
01:17:22,947 --> 01:17:25,147
Au revoir.
I will miss you.

989
01:17:26,347 --> 01:17:27,947
We're gonna be late.

990
01:17:38,947 --> 01:17:40,347
So, uh...

991
01:17:42,147 --> 01:17:43,247
Well, uh...

992
01:17:45,247 --> 01:17:48,247
I guess you guys, uh...
Gotta hit the...

993
01:17:49,447 --> 01:17:52,447
Jeremy, you're not gonna get
All mushy-gushy on us, are you?

994
01:17:52,747 --> 01:17:56,047
Yeah, the last thing the state department needs
Is a mushy-gushy diplomat.

995
01:17:56,347 --> 01:17:58,247
That could kill your rep big time.

996
01:18:01,147 --> 01:18:04,347
- Thanks for everything.
- We're gonna miss you, you know.

997
01:18:07,347 --> 01:18:08,347
Get over here.

998
01:18:13,147 --> 01:18:15,247
We'll see you back in the states, ok?

999
01:18:15,447 --> 01:18:18,147
- I promise. Ok?
- We better get going.

1000
01:18:20,147 --> 01:18:22,047
- We'll miss you guys.
- Bye.

1001
01:18:22,147 --> 01:18:24,247
Bye. Take care of them, mr. Ambassador.

1002
01:18:24,747 --> 01:18:29,247
I'm very proud of you girls.
No, i mean i'm proud of you ladies.

1003
01:18:30,347 --> 01:18:32,247
- Thanks, grandpa.
- You're welcome.

1004
01:18:32,847 --> 01:18:34,947
Hey, come on.
We've got a plane to catch.

1005
01:18:35,447 --> 01:18:36,647
We?

1006
01:18:45,147 --> 01:18:46,647
I'm taking a vacation.

1007
01:18:47,347 --> 01:18:52,047
I want to spend some time
Chillin' with my totally a-plus-plus family.

1008
01:18:52,547 --> 01:18:55,147
- Both: awesome!
- [laughs] jinx!

1009
01:18:59,447 --> 01:19:03,347
Grandpa: oh, gallyson, ballyson, jelanie, zelanie...

1010
01:19:04,047 --> 01:19:06,647
It's gonna be a nice quiet flight home.

1011
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:15,547
Melanie: oh, don't worry.
Grandpa finally did unjinx us.

1012
01:19:17,747 --> 01:19:20,147
So that was the end of our par is vacation.

1013
01:19:20,847 --> 01:19:23,747
And, boy, we came home with some great memories.

1014
01:19:48,647 --> 01:19:52,147
We were only gone for a week,
But we changed for a lifetime.

1015
01:19:53,947 --> 01:19:58,547

- On the back of their mopeds.

1016

Melanie: ok, not everything changed.
But, hey, rome wasn't built in a day.

1017
01:20:07,447 --> 01:20:10,647
It says here that rome streets
Are paved with the history of civilization.

1018
01:20:10,947 --> 01:20:15,147
And africa's grasslands Have some of the world's
largest herds Of elephants, giraffes, and zebras.
