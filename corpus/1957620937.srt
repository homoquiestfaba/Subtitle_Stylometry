while I was talking to Santa,

627
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:17,043
and he went for the idea
in a big way.

(Mary)
He did?

629

a huge, gigantic,

[Clearing throat]
Well, actually,

633
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:30,156
he wants 1,000 of 'em.

634
00:31:30,189 --> 00:31:33,125
1,000, in 2 days?

635

Yeah!

are the most fun.

near that toy factory again,

it's straight
to the goblin forest,

with you?
