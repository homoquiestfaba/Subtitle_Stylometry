1
00:00:05,754 --> 00:00:11,579
 Suggestion: MR ROBOT, PERSON OF INTEREST , WHOAMI(GERMAN)

2
00:01:56,537 --> 00:01:58,737
What's going on?

3
00:02:00,257 --> 00:02:03,737
What was that?

4
00:02:03,897 --> 00:02:08,897
- Maybe a power failure.
- It was not a power failure.

5
00:02:11,977 --> 00:02:14,377
Everything seems fine.

6
00:02:16,777 --> 00:02:21,937
The temperature in the core increases.

7
00:02:22,097 --> 00:02:25,698
Cooling systems do not work.
They are offline.

8
00:02:25,857 --> 00:02:29,697
- Get them back online.
- I'm trying. They do not correspond.

9
00:02:34,097 --> 00:02:37,697
The generators do not respond.

10
00:02:41,817 --> 00:02:44,817
It is critical.

11
00:03:08,297 --> 00:03:11,817
- Do not go in there.
- Want to do it instead?

12
00:03:46,057 --> 00:03:50,937
Get away from there.

13
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:55,458
The temperature is still rising.
The radiation is ... Oh, my God.

14
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:20,617
Farid?
Cooling systems operate again.

15
00:04:20,778 --> 00:04:24,898
You made it.

16
00:04:25,058 --> 00:04:28,977
Farid? Can you hear me? Farid!

17
00:04:43,578 --> 00:04:46,657
What do you mean,
that it was not us?

18
00:04:46,818 --> 00:04:49,858
Is cyber sabotage not
our specialty?

19
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:52,818
The Russians and Chinese are
has improved.

20
00:04:52,977 --> 00:04:56,578
The Russians and Chinese are sold
reactor technology to them.

21
00:04:56,738 --> 00:04:58,778
An attack damages business.

22
00:04:58,938 --> 00:05:04,218
- Who then? Our allies?
- The Israelis are not liable.

23
00:05:04,378 --> 00:05:08,818
Of course, but they were very
determined to remove the plant.

24
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:12,457
Not so.
The goal of a viral attack is -

25
00:05:12,618 --> 00:05:15,418
- Damaging a target without civilian casualties.

26
00:05:15,578 --> 00:05:21,818
This sought a meltdown.
The number of dead could be enormous.

27
00:05:21,978 --> 00:05:24,018
In the short term a few dozen -

28
00:05:24,178 --> 00:05:27,858
- But in the long term
it could surpass Chernobyl.

29
00:05:28,018 --> 00:05:33,618
They produce oil
and does not need nuclear power.

30
00:05:33,778 --> 00:05:39,578
They wanted plutonium
arms, but was stopped.

31
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:41,738
You're missing a point, General.

32
00:05:41,898 --> 00:05:44,938
Someone did us a favor,
but what now?

33
00:05:45,098 --> 00:05:48,539
- How many nuclear power plants do we have?
- 65

34
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:53,658
- Are they all vulnerable to attack?
- Yes.

35
00:05:53,818 --> 00:05:57,378
The guilty parties do not care
with human life.

36
00:05:57,538 --> 00:06:02,738
We know neither
their identity or whereabouts.

37
00:06:08,938 --> 00:06:14,178
The Bowden on the road.
Put me on to the president.

38
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:37,298
Daniel Gerson:
Have you seen this?

39
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:44,178
Error on Iranian nuclear plant
Thousands lack power. Gab.

40
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:48,339
- And?
- Cover for meltdown?

41
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:53,739
- Wait, Miles.
- Come on.

42
00:06:55,818 --> 00:07:00,898
- Do you have the story of local law?
- Soon ...

43
00:07:01,058 --> 00:07:05,379
Have you read the story
the nuclear power plant in the Middle East?

44
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:08,738
Persians cook by candlelight.
Is it new?

45
00:07:08,898 --> 00:07:12,978
Maybe there was almost
a meltdown.

46
00:07:13,138 --> 00:07:16,818
News Services had
written on it.

47
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:21,939
- Maybe there's a cover?
- You want a great story, Jesse.

48
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:26,178
- A power failure far away?
- I have a source.

49
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:31,139
The guy I interviewed
to the article on computer activism.

50
00:07:31,299 --> 00:07:34,899
The kid? He knows only something
of pirated software.

51
00:07:35,058 --> 00:07:38,098
Write the story that was assigned to you.

52
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:43,899
If you want the big story,
Do you master the little first.

53
00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:09,019
Can I help?

54
00:08:09,179 --> 00:08:11,259
Hey. Is Daniel here?

55
00:08:12,938 --> 00:08:18,299
I sent him in the city
to get him away from the computer.

56
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:22,299
- Come in.
- Thank you. Jesse White.

57
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:25,179
I'm Danny's mother, Fiona.

58
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:29,859
I am sorry mess
but you may be accustomed to it.

59
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:35,019
No, this is not so.
I am a journalist.

60
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:39,739
He's coming back soon.
Make yourself comfortable.

61
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:42,659
I must attack the bathroom.

62
00:08:42,819 --> 00:08:45,899
Not a single tenant
a scrubbing brush.

63
00:08:53,219 --> 00:08:55,340
Oops!

64
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:23,979
- What?
- Jesse?

65
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:31,219
- What are you doing here?
- I did not know you were a fan.

66
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:33,779
It's about research.

67
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:36,380
- So ...
- So ...

68
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:42,260
Nuclear plant in the Middle East
as close to a meltdown.

69
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:47,259
I can tell you that it was due
a virus that was sent outside.

70
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:50,819
Like Stuxnet virus?

71
00:09:50,979 --> 00:09:54,259
The one who almost hit
urancentrifugerne?

72
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:58,619
It was created
of the intelligence services -

73
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:04,579
- And would lower the efficiency.
You talk about the countless victims.

74
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,940
- Interesting.
- My editor needs a source.

75
00:10:08,099 --> 00:10:12,779
- I assume that you have one.
- Maybe.

76
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,339
Yes, sir. It was good
to talk to you.

77
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,780
Wait! Dubito. Ring any bells?

78
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:27,140
- The hackers who attacked the IMF?
- They call themselves "hacktivists".

79
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,899
Are you with them?
Do you know them?

80
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,860
Yes, I know the powerful players.

81
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,059
The FBI has been following them
for some time.

82
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:42,139
- If I can get an interview ...
- They are mysterious.

83
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:46,100
You call not just for them.

84
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,779
You do not know them, right?

85
00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:57,460
I was invited
into one of their chat rooms.

86
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,020
Very secretly,
only to the initiated.

87
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:06,380
I'm done. I'm going.

88
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,860
- It was good to meet you, Jesse.
- You too.

89
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,820
- I want to meet them.
- Impossible.

90
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:24,620
You can ask them.
I would greatly appreciate.

91
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,580
Okay.

92
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,380
... Would like to meet you.

93
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:36,300
Okay. Now we wait.

94
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,740
Vernon Spriggs air base
California

95
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,581
- Are we ready, Colonel?
- Yes, sir.

96
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,820
This test has many opponents.

97
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,420
A success will
President's critics silent.

98
00:12:08,581 --> 00:12:13,460
A missile shield to protect the United States,
might shush them.

99
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,900
- Let us hope so.
- We're ready.

100
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,780
Nine, eight, seven, six -

101
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:24,460
- Five, four, three, two, one.

102
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:34,700
<i>That's him.
Fireball, fireball, 2-0-0-5. </i>

103
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,900
- Air Force approved.
- Approved.

104
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:55,260
Eagle 1 fired, 2-0-0-5.

105
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,821
Time to live: 45 seconds.

106
00:13:10,461 --> 00:13:13,980
What the hell?

107
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:17,021
- What happened?
- I do not know.

108
00:13:17,181 --> 00:13:21,060
Meeting in five, four, three, two ...

109
00:13:23,461 --> 00:13:27,861
- Say something, Captain.
- Eagle 1 has changed tack.

110
00:13:28,021 --> 00:13:32,301
- How can this happen?
- It's on the way back.

111
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,660
- Disconnect missiles.
- Yes.

112
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:40,741
Mï¿½lmissil interrupted.
Air defense missile ...

113
00:13:43,101 --> 00:13:47,621
- Air defense missile still in the air.
- Try again.

114
00:13:47,781 --> 00:13:49,900
No reply, sir.

115
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:56,581
- I want the bird down.
- I'm trying.

116
00:13:56,741 --> 00:14:00,021
- What's going on?
- We have lost the connection.

117
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,181
Where it lands?

118
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:07,860
If it stays on track,
hits the San Fransisco.

119
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:12,221
- Still no answer.
- Reductions in 20 seconds.

120
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,940
Missile down.

121
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:55,541
- You name the ants?
- My mom thinks they're weird.

122
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:58,981
It is not strange to have ants.
Perhaps eccentric.

123
00:14:59,141 --> 00:15:05,181
Einstein was eccentric,
so I'm in good company.

124
00:15:05,341 --> 00:15:11,381
Ants are social
and extremely well-organized.

125
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:15,501
They are predators and are territorial.

126
00:15:15,661 --> 00:15:21,341
They wage war, besiege,
keep slaves ...

127
00:15:21,501 --> 00:15:25,901
They are humanity,
and I am their god.

128
00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:31,661
I am a benevolent god,
respecting them.

129
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:35,781
- And if they bite you?
- So they feel my wrath.

130
00:15:35,942 --> 00:15:38,781
Belphegor:
Are you crazy? No.

131
00:15:38,941 --> 00:15:41,182
I said it.

132
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:47,381
Tell Belphegor who I am.
Tell me what I want to write.

133
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:51,101
He will never meet a journalist.

134
00:15:53,581 --> 00:15:55,781
Really?

135
00:15:59,302 --> 00:16:03,461
There has been something important.
Do you want to switch to TV?

136
00:16:06,461 --> 00:16:09,822
Victoria Mendez
from Los Altos, California.

137
00:16:09,982 --> 00:16:14,141
An hour ago
struck a missile into the area.

138
00:16:14,301 --> 00:16:18,301
<i>reported at least 50 dead
and many wounded. </i>

139
00:16:18,462 --> 00:16:23,542
<i>We hear that the missile came
from Vernon Spriggs airbase. </i>

140
00:16:23,702 --> 00:16:29,862
Air Force investigating the incident,
but otherwise the authorities are silent.

141
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:35,141
Meanwhile, the civil consternation.

142
00:16:45,542 --> 00:16:51,542
- The guards to prevent accidents.
- It was not an accident.

143
00:16:51,702 --> 00:16:55,702
Vernon Spriggs was the victim
for a cyber attack.

144
00:16:55,861 --> 00:17:01,942
The worm is similar to the virus,
who attacked the facility in Quareshi.

145
00:17:02,102 --> 00:17:06,421
Built it in our virus
we sent toward the goal?

146
00:17:06,581 --> 00:17:09,301
It originated probably from the same source.

147
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:14,182
Is there anything we should know?
Fits the NSA our cyber rebellion -

148
00:17:14,342 --> 00:17:19,341
- With covert operations,
we do not know about?

149
00:17:19,502 --> 00:17:25,101
NSA did not use the virus
and is not responsible for the incidents.

150
00:17:25,262 --> 00:17:28,582
Who then?

151
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:38,382
- Hackers?
- It's not just teenagers.

152
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:44,142
The group is highly sophisticated
and has performed many operations.

153
00:17:44,301 --> 00:17:48,422
This trend is alarming,
but follows its radical philosophy.

154
00:17:48,582 --> 00:17:53,142
It has several statements
condemned the missile program -

155
00:17:53,302 --> 00:17:56,262
- Including this,
is set to four days old.

156
00:17:56,422 --> 00:18:00,182
It warns of the consequences,
if the test is done.

157
00:18:00,342 --> 00:18:03,782
They have maintained their anonymity
so far.

158
00:18:03,942 --> 00:18:08,542
They must be found and apprehended. Now.

159
00:18:13,943 --> 00:18:15,622
FBI Headquarters

160
00:18:15,782 --> 00:18:21,343
"Dubito" is derived from the Latin
"Cogito ergo Dubito ergo sum".

161
00:18:21,502 --> 00:18:24,182
You know what that means?

162
00:18:26,902 --> 00:18:29,382
I doubt, therefore I think and are.

163
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:33,742
Dubito. Duibito. Dubito.

164
00:18:33,902 --> 00:18:38,262
The inner circle is a select group
from around the world.

165
00:18:38,422 --> 00:18:42,862
In addition, we do not know much.
They are ghosts, and it must be changed.

166
00:18:43,023 --> 00:18:48,822
I want to know who they are,
and what they do.

167
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,343
Vancouver

168
00:19:07,423 --> 00:19:09,903
New York City

169
00:19:10,063 --> 00:19:12,543
Sapporo

170
00:19:12,702 --> 00:19:15,182
Paris

171
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:24,063
Pittsburgh

172
00:19:27,183 --> 00:19:30,702
- What you got?
- They are skilled.

173
00:19:30,862 --> 00:19:36,622
In May 2009, they attacked the military
in Southeast Asia.

174
00:19:36,783 --> 00:19:40,383
In April 2010, the traps
a Swiss bank.

175
00:19:40,543 --> 00:19:46,902
In February 2011, helping the
Middle Eastern media against regimes.

176
00:19:47,063 --> 00:19:53,862
- What does the names?
- Hell princes, seven deadly sins.

177
00:19:54,022 --> 00:20:00,423
- Lucifer, Mammon, Leviathan ...
- Belphegor?

178
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:04,702
He deceived people with inventions
which would make them rich.

179
00:20:04,862 --> 00:20:09,023
Although, a demon who use
technology to create chaos.

180
00:20:09,183 --> 00:20:11,943
They must have a weakness.
There must be a way.

181
00:20:12,103 --> 00:20:15,702
Mafia. When the FBI cracked
Carpezzi family -

182
00:20:15,863 --> 00:20:21,742
- We did not go after the heads,
but the soldiers. It was way into.

183
00:20:21,903 --> 00:20:26,863
Low-ranked hackers
that will create a name for himself.

184
00:20:27,023 --> 00:20:31,423
Should anyone take us to Dubito,
it's one of those guys.

185
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:34,983
That sounds good.
Is there an obvious candidate?

186
00:20:37,223 --> 00:20:39,823
Okay.

187
00:20:50,343 --> 00:20:55,303
Are we just,
there is coffee to Belphegor?

188
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:58,263
He knows enough of who we are.

189
00:21:22,543 --> 00:21:25,383
Mammon

190
00:22:01,383 --> 00:22:03,463
Lucifer

191
00:22:37,783 --> 00:22:39,584
Leviathan

192
00:23:15,744 --> 00:23:18,464
Beelzebub

193
00:23:53,824 --> 00:23:57,544
Anonymous: Armageddon
Beelzebub: ...

194
00:24:06,824 --> 00:24:10,144
It was too good to be true.

195
00:24:10,304 --> 00:24:15,464
We learn well acquainted. We ...

196
00:24:15,624 --> 00:24:17,824
Sit down.

197
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:24,944
- I am a big fan.
- Let's get down to business.

198
00:24:25,104 --> 00:24:31,225
You wrote the article
on-line activists. It was good.

199
00:24:31,384 --> 00:24:34,704
Why was the nuclear plant attack?

200
00:24:34,864 --> 00:24:38,424
All we fear is happening now.

201
00:24:38,584 --> 00:24:41,544
The meltdown,
Missile the incident. It starts.

202
00:24:41,704 --> 00:24:46,224
Was missile incident did not
an accident?

203
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,665
I tried to stop it.

204
00:24:48,824 --> 00:24:52,264
Stop it? How?
Who is responsible?

205
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:54,864
Who ... No, it's ...

206
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:02,785
- Is there something wrong?
- Green jacket, he was on the train.

207
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:09,464
- Maybe it's a coincidence.
- No.

208
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:12,744
Your service provider owned
of a conglomerate -

209
00:25:12,904 --> 00:25:15,665
- Supporting a politician -

210
00:25:15,825 --> 00:25:18,784
- That govern contributions to the NSA.

211
00:25:18,944 --> 00:25:24,424
Is it a case, you can ignore
click sounds when you answer the phone.

212
00:25:24,585 --> 00:25:27,384
It's probably nothing.

213
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,824
Forget it.

214
00:25:33,905 --> 00:25:36,704
Do not!

215
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:49,865
Oh!

216
00:25:56,265 --> 00:25:59,465
No!

217
00:26:01,905 --> 00:26:04,665
He is gone!

218
00:26:08,144 --> 00:26:11,225
Call the police!

219
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:29,144
- Are you Daniel Gerson?
- Who are you?

220
00:26:29,305 --> 00:26:32,024
- Who are you?
- Jesse White, journalist.

221
00:26:32,185 --> 00:26:37,945
- I'm from the FBI. You're under arrest.
- He has done nothing.

222
00:26:38,105 --> 00:26:42,825
He is associated with cyber crime
and is now at a crime scene.

223
00:26:42,985 --> 00:26:46,625
He is a child.
We had to meet the guy when someone shot.

224
00:26:46,785 --> 00:26:48,904
We have nothing to do with it.

225
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:53,065
- Should you both to meet him?
- Yes, I'm writing a story.

226
00:26:53,225 --> 00:27:00,105
- You are a witness and must follow.
- This is ridiculous. We were shot at.

227
00:27:18,865 --> 00:27:21,865
New message
Very important

228
00:27:31,785 --> 00:27:34,625
I add you
as my first friend.

229
00:27:36,585 --> 00:27:39,505
Who are you?

230
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:44,305
Please do.

231
00:27:49,865 --> 00:27:53,345
Naomi rings.

232
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:59,706
<i>You must come home, Mike.
Alicia has had a seizure. </i>

233
00:27:59,865 --> 00:28:02,905
<i>- Call the ambulance.
- She breathes not. </i>

234
00:28:03,065 --> 00:28:05,425
I'm almost there.

235
00:28:17,145 --> 00:28:20,146
Naomi! That's me.

236
00:28:23,986 --> 00:28:28,585
- Where is Alicia?
- In bed. What's wrong?

237
00:28:39,945 --> 00:28:42,626
What is it?

238
00:28:45,065 --> 00:28:48,106
You called,
because she had a seizure.

239
00:28:48,266 --> 00:28:51,465
No. She has not had
an attack for months.

240
00:29:00,746 --> 00:29:02,986
Friend or foe?

241
00:29:04,186 --> 00:29:06,585
Talk to me.

242
00:29:11,306 --> 00:29:13,705
What's going on?

243
00:29:19,345 --> 00:29:20,666
Blocked ID

244
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:24,306
It is work. It is Overson.

245
00:29:24,466 --> 00:29:29,186
- The Bowden. What have you done?
- I have to call back.

246
00:29:29,345 --> 00:29:32,426
The phone is shown compromised.

247
00:29:40,146 --> 00:29:42,346
I want an explanation.

248
00:29:42,506 --> 00:29:47,266
<i>- What happened?
- They should not be killed. </i>

249
00:29:47,426 --> 00:29:49,706
Turn whom death?

250
00:29:49,866 --> 00:29:55,866
The hackers who sabotaged the missile,
was identified as Target Red.

251
00:29:56,026 --> 00:30:00,026
<i>have been killed,
and it stinks of NSA. </i>

252
00:30:00,186 --> 00:30:03,786
I have not given the order.

253
00:30:03,946 --> 00:30:06,146
<i>Who then? </i>

254
00:30:08,946 --> 00:30:13,466
The guy was shot,
before I got something useful.

255
00:30:13,626 --> 00:30:17,906
You must aim me or let me go.
I know the system.

256
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:21,106
Reporters in that
According to the Patriot Act -

257
00:30:21,266 --> 00:30:24,146
- I can keep you,
as long as I want.

258
00:30:24,306 --> 00:30:29,786
- You have shown contempt of court.
- I was protecting my sources.

259
00:30:29,946 --> 00:30:33,146
- Two arrests for disobedience.
- Exonerated.

260
00:30:33,306 --> 00:30:36,746
It's good to know
the rule of law exists.

261
00:30:40,226 --> 00:30:42,826
Fine, you can go.

262
00:30:42,986 --> 00:30:45,786
Thank you.

263
00:30:45,946 --> 00:30:48,346
- What about Daniel?
- He is.

264
00:30:48,506 --> 00:30:51,106
- He knows nothing.
- I think so now.

265
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:55,146
I hope that you have
compromised your integrity.

266
00:30:55,306 --> 00:31:01,427
Agent Max Hollis flying witch hunt.
Is it the story?

267
00:31:02,706 --> 00:31:05,986
Your source is in a coma,
and your friend is a suspect.

268
00:31:06,146 --> 00:31:08,746
You have no history.

269
00:31:13,146 --> 00:31:16,546
It was NSA agents
killed Dubito leaders.

270
00:31:16,706 --> 00:31:21,146
Our codes and networks.
It all leads back to the office.

271
00:31:21,307 --> 00:31:23,507
Someone will hit me.

272
00:31:28,307 --> 00:31:34,146
- Who is able to do so?
- We wanted to identify Dubito.

273
00:31:34,306 --> 00:31:39,106
Kill The orders contained
names and addresses.

274
00:31:39,267 --> 00:31:43,506
The information came from nowhere.

275
00:31:43,667 --> 00:31:49,147
I've never met the guy before.
I knew him barely.

276
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:56,027
Your chat history says otherwise.

277
00:31:56,187 --> 00:31:59,226
You've known him for over a year.

278
00:31:59,386 --> 00:32:03,466
- Did you take my computer?
- You'll get it back.

279
00:32:03,626 --> 00:32:09,506
My people have taken a copy
and will scour it thoroughly.

280
00:32:11,426 --> 00:32:16,867
I have spoken with him. Online.
We shared interests.

281
00:32:17,027 --> 00:32:20,147
As hacking government sites?

282
00:32:20,307 --> 00:32:24,626
- You wanted attention.
- This is not so.

283
00:32:24,786 --> 00:32:28,987
- You admire them.
- I believe in their positions.

284
00:32:29,146 --> 00:32:33,027
- They are murderers.
- It was not them.

285
00:32:33,187 --> 00:32:35,586
Not? Who was it?

286
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:40,946
Who can hack a top-secret
military base and take over a missile?

287
00:32:41,106 --> 00:32:44,987
Can you? You would be noted.
Maybe it was your test.

288
00:32:45,147 --> 00:32:51,187
- This is madness.
- You better cooperation.

289
00:32:51,347 --> 00:32:54,347
I'm trying. I know nothing.

290
00:32:54,507 --> 00:32:59,787
I can try to find the others.
I can send out feelers.

291
00:32:59,947 --> 00:33:03,107
The others? As Mammon -

292
00:33:03,267 --> 00:33:07,307
- Beelzebub, Leviathan, Lucifer.

293
00:33:07,467 --> 00:33:09,507
It calls itself.

294
00:33:09,667 --> 00:33:13,307
You'll be pushed to find them,
for they are dead.

295
00:33:13,466 --> 00:33:16,667
Belphegor is the only one left.

296
00:33:17,827 --> 00:33:20,147
- Oh, my goodness.
- Yes.

297
00:33:20,307 --> 00:33:26,427
You have to hope that he survives,
only he knows what is happening.

298
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,627
What the ..?

299
00:34:25,107 --> 00:34:27,708
- Is everything all right?
- Yes.

300
00:34:27,867 --> 00:34:32,908
The system went down,
but now it seems certain.

301
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:37,107
When I have computer problems
help my son of 11 years.

302
00:34:37,267 --> 00:34:39,467
He directs my engineering department.

303
00:35:02,428 --> 00:35:04,628
Hov? Hey!

304
00:35:07,788 --> 00:35:09,867
My goodness!

305
00:35:10,027 --> 00:35:13,548
Code blue! We need help!

306
00:35:48,748 --> 00:35:54,028
There was a failure of the computer night.
Belphegor died.

307
00:35:57,227 --> 00:35:59,428
So ...

308
00:36:00,787 --> 00:36:06,428
- Was it a coincidence?
- No.

309
00:36:08,548 --> 00:36:13,868
There is fair game hackers.
Do you really want out of here?

310
00:36:14,028 --> 00:36:20,468
- Why should I be safe here?
- Just do not be connected to machines.

311
00:36:21,668 --> 00:36:26,027
Everything is connected.
On the one way or another.

312
00:36:29,428 --> 00:36:31,628
Yes.

313
00:36:33,388 --> 00:36:35,428
Let's get out of here.

314
00:36:41,948 --> 00:36:44,028
I am not a crook.

315
00:36:44,188 --> 00:36:49,828
You are lucky that we do not have proof.
Do not feel too safe.

316
00:36:49,988 --> 00:36:54,628
Can they reach Belphegor,
they can reach you. Here.

317
00:36:58,228 --> 00:37:03,668
Take it. Ring,
if you remember anything.

318
00:37:03,828 --> 00:37:06,108
Do not leave town.

319
00:37:10,508 --> 00:37:12,708
What?

320
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:18,268
What a mess.

321
00:37:29,149 --> 00:37:31,948
Daniel? It's just me.

322
00:37:32,108 --> 00:37:36,549
I called to hear the news,
and they said that you were free.

323
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:40,868
A big mess.

324
00:37:41,028 --> 00:37:43,908
Have you heard of Belphegor?

325
00:37:45,309 --> 00:37:48,349
They are all dead. No more Dubito.

326
00:37:48,508 --> 00:37:51,668
What? All together.

327
00:37:54,828 --> 00:37:58,988
What could be so important
they were murdered?

328
00:38:07,308 --> 00:38:12,909
- Did you notice Belphegors T-shirt?
- No.

329
00:38:13,069 --> 00:38:16,589
There was a logo Mecha Omega 3 ...

330
00:38:17,668 --> 00:38:20,228
- Mecha Armageddon 3?
- Yes.

331
00:38:20,388 --> 00:38:24,429
It is a game. It has cult status.

332
00:38:24,589 --> 00:38:28,188
It released until next summer.

333
00:38:29,588 --> 00:38:33,189
He must have connection
to producers.

334
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:35,549
There it is.

335
00:38:39,428 --> 00:38:44,108
- Belphegor Brian Fisher.
- Well done.

336
00:38:46,308 --> 00:38:48,949
If he has a backup,
is it there.

337
00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:51,989
- Can you hack it?
- No, that's the point.

338
00:38:52,149 --> 00:38:56,349
The companies have secure intranet
which is separated from the web.

339
00:38:56,509 --> 00:38:59,789
One must penetrate physically.

340
00:39:08,909 --> 00:39:14,069
- I would not be arrested. Hollis -
- Forget agent Hollis.

341
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:27,709
It is Ralph. My dog.

342
00:39:29,429 --> 00:39:33,629
Really?
You do not work as a dog owner.

343
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:37,229
- What does it mean?
- Nothing.

344
00:39:37,389 --> 00:39:42,229
You seem like one
who prefer cats.

345
00:39:42,389 --> 00:39:45,309
Do I seem cold?

346
00:39:45,469 --> 00:39:50,669
- I did not say.
- The guy that keeps ants ...

347
00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:55,349
Ants are more interesting,
than people think.

348
00:39:55,509 --> 00:39:57,709
This is it.

349
00:40:20,189 --> 00:40:22,350
Come on.

350
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:27,150
Okay.

351
00:40:33,149 --> 00:40:36,470
Come on.

352
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,869
- What are you doing?
- Breaking the lock.

353
00:40:43,429 --> 00:40:46,949
- It works almost always.
- What the hell?

354
00:40:47,109 --> 00:40:49,709
Okay ...

355
00:40:49,869 --> 00:40:56,670
If you disconnect the telephone line,
you call the police.

356
00:40:58,909 --> 00:41:01,750
Exactly. Come on.

357
00:41:01,909 --> 00:41:04,149
Come on.

358
00:41:07,269 --> 00:41:11,750
For the cat ...

359
00:41:11,909 --> 00:41:14,549
I was thinking about you -

360
00:41:14,709 --> 00:41:18,870
- As an independent, cool under pressure,
just like at the coffee shop.

361
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:22,109
Only be quiet.

362
00:41:31,549 --> 00:41:35,789
Our guy from the company enters
with a cop.

363
00:41:35,949 --> 00:41:38,829
Checking in the second area.

364
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:49,149
That's incredible. You are incredible.

365
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:55,350
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- I just broke up.

366
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:00,030
He betrayed me.

367
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:05,830
It sucks.
I have no girlfriend.

368
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:09,670
It did not expect to.

369
00:42:11,909 --> 00:42:15,150
- Why not?
- Here they come.

370
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:23,149
There must be something wrong
with alarm. We will be here tomorrow.

371
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:25,510
Good night.

372
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:31,070
Meanwhile, we have an opportunity.

373
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,590
Bingo.

374
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:16,390
Files can be encrypted.

375
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:19,310
We have plenty of time.

376
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:49,430
- I can not believe it.
- What is it?

377
00:43:50,831 --> 00:43:56,550
They hacked data associated
brain patterns.

378
00:43:56,711 --> 00:43:59,591
It is the building block
for an artificial intelligence.

379
00:43:59,751 --> 00:44:04,951
Creates any intelligence
from the stolen data?

380
00:44:05,111 --> 00:44:07,750
No, this is the case.

381
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:10,831
Everyone wants to know
who has done it.

382
00:44:10,991 --> 00:44:13,110
The answer is no.

383
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:16,150
Dubito figured it out
and was murdered.

384
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:18,710
I do not understand.

385
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:24,070
For years, people said,
the world's interconnected computers -

386
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:29,550
- Could form a critical mass,
as a consciousness arose.

387
00:44:31,431 --> 00:44:37,150
It is as in Shelley "Frankenstein",
where the doctor uses many sources.

388
00:44:37,311 --> 00:44:40,150
This created the creature itself.

389
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:47,550
If Dubito right,
do you know what the creature can?

390
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:52,951
- What?
- What it wants.

391
00:44:58,631 --> 00:45:02,431
You should write the real story.
I have an idea.

392
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:07,990
Now you are also burglar.

393
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:11,591
- How did you find me?
- We traced your phone.

394
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:16,111
We had your location
as soon as you turned on the phone.

395
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:21,551
<i>- Start talking.
- We visit. </i>

396
00:45:28,071 --> 00:45:30,591
Michael Overson, NSA.

397
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:33,431
I did not know that you attended.

398
00:45:33,591 --> 00:45:37,471
I participate in everything,
relating to national security.

399
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:42,710
Is he one of yours?
Our boys take it from here.

400
00:45:42,871 --> 00:45:45,391
- What's your name?
- Daniel Gerson.

401
00:45:45,551 --> 00:45:48,591
Share what you know.

402
00:45:50,751 --> 00:45:53,911
- Is the security system online?
- Yes. Why?

403
00:45:54,071 --> 00:45:58,551
Cameras can read lips.
Have not seen "2001"?

404
00:45:58,711 --> 00:46:03,991
Here are computers with microphones.
We have to go somewhere else.

405
00:46:16,991 --> 00:46:22,031
- Are you talking about artificial intelligence?
- A technological singularity.

406
00:46:22,191 --> 00:46:26,511
Spontaneously generated and autonomous
without human control.

407
00:46:26,671 --> 00:46:30,111
It sounds far-fetched.

408
00:46:30,271 --> 00:46:36,311
How many computers are online
in the world right now?

409
00:46:36,471 --> 00:46:41,631
Billions. We connect
enough synapses, you get a brain.

410
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:47,511
I can not prove consciousness,
before it reveals itself.

411
00:46:49,311 --> 00:46:52,952
Displays the files,
how to destroy it?

412
00:46:53,111 --> 00:46:58,032
It is no longer a computer error
but a living entity.

413
00:47:03,151 --> 00:47:06,792
- What is it?
- A statement.

414
00:47:06,952 --> 00:47:10,071
All we have said is confidential.

415
00:47:10,232 --> 00:47:13,631
If you do sign,
we drop all charges.

416
00:47:13,792 --> 00:47:18,072
- He is part of the investigation.
- I have spoken with your boss.

417
00:47:18,231 --> 00:47:21,551
He assured me
you cooperate.

418
00:47:33,871 --> 00:47:39,072
- It took you quite nicely.
- To my action was taken?

419
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:45,031
Is it a sensitive intelligence
you would get the honor of discovering it.

420
00:47:45,192 --> 00:47:48,431
It is about stopping it.

421
00:47:48,591 --> 00:47:51,471
They have no idea
what they're doing.

422
00:47:51,632 --> 00:47:55,151
They treat it as a bug,
to be obliterated.

423
00:47:55,311 --> 00:47:57,471
What if it makes it worse?

424
00:47:57,631 --> 00:48:00,072
If you want to stop here?

425
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:08,392
- Where's Jesse?
- I do not know.

426
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:11,552
- Were you alone last night?
- Yes.

427
00:48:11,712 --> 00:48:15,312
We should play poker.
It would be easy money.

428
00:48:15,471 --> 00:48:17,671
What does she know?

429
00:48:19,672 --> 00:48:23,592
- She may know a bit.
- You signed a contract.

430
00:48:23,752 --> 00:48:29,392
Publish she something, it is
as writing that aliens exist.

431
00:48:29,552 --> 00:48:32,392
It says governments
when they are hiding something.

432
00:48:32,552 --> 00:48:35,192
Maybe people deserve the truth.

433
00:48:35,351 --> 00:48:38,712
Do I get out?

434
00:48:42,631 --> 00:48:45,032
Thank you.

435
00:48:45,192 --> 00:48:49,992
You are playing with fire. You better watch.

436
00:48:51,712 --> 00:48:53,912
See you, fool.

437
00:48:56,272 --> 00:48:58,832
- Can you crack the encryption?
- Yes.

438
00:48:58,992 --> 00:49:02,512
He went to great lengths to keep
of its secrets.

439
00:49:05,392 --> 00:49:09,672
You do not think it is
artificial intelligence, right?

440
00:49:11,072 --> 00:49:13,872
Why kill Dubito,
if they were wrong?

441
00:49:32,632 --> 00:49:34,872
A computer program?

442
00:49:36,712 --> 00:49:39,912
It is so sophisticated,
it can think.

443
00:49:40,072 --> 00:49:44,312
Explain how it creates itself.

444
00:49:44,472 --> 00:49:48,152
Macro Evolution,
spontaneous creation from the anomaly.

445
00:49:48,312 --> 00:49:52,992
Put science on the shelf.
This creature is attacking us.

446
00:49:53,153 --> 00:49:55,952
No, it does not.
Not in a targeted manner.

447
00:49:56,112 --> 00:50:00,153
- Is it spontaneous events?

448
00:50:00,312 --> 00:50:03,472
It tries to adapt
in its element .

449
00:50:03,632 --> 00:50:08,552
The secure our attempts
to outwit the nuclear plant.

450
00:50:08,712 --> 00:50:11,872
The test their abilities.

451
00:50:12,032 --> 00:50:16,152
- It kills people .
- It might not be the intention.

452
00:50:16,312 --> 00:50:20,792
So early in development it fits ,
it is self-centered -

453
00:50:20,952 --> 00:50:23,913
- Without regard to consequences.

454
00:50:24,072 --> 00:50:27,672
- It sounds like a child.
- It can be said .

455
00:50:27,832 --> 00:50:30,792
This does not sound Christian -

456
00:50:30,952 --> 00:50:34,672
- But if a child appeared
and murdered people -

457
00:50:34,832 --> 00:50:38,313
- I wish
that someone killed it .

458
00:50:40,152 --> 00:50:42,953
We need to know more ,
before we make a plan .

459
00:50:43,113 --> 00:50:46,472
What do you know ?

460
00:50:50,192 --> 00:50:56,833
- Who knows about it ?
- We believe that it is detained.

461
00:51:00,752 --> 00:51:06,273
It is not just a great story,
it may be the biggest ever.

462
00:51:06,433 --> 00:51:11,513
Do I believe that a computer program
thinking himself and kills people?

463
00:51:11,673 --> 00:51:17,072
- It is very understandable.
- You lost your grip.

464
00:51:20,192 --> 00:51:22,913
This thing is
an artificial intelligence .

465
00:51:23,072 --> 00:51:26,713
It will be stronger and more dangerous .

466
00:51:26,873 --> 00:51:31,153
Other things will happen .
People have a right to know it.

467
00:51:31,312 --> 00:51:34,872
Go while you still have a job ...

468
00:52:07,753 --> 00:52:11,393
- That's me.
- How's your turn ?

469
00:52:11,553 --> 00:52:14,433
- What about Alicia?
- She sleeps with Kyla .

470
00:52:14,593 --> 00:52:18,153
No, it does not .
We have to take care of her.

471
00:52:18,313 --> 00:52:21,273
You may visit Dr. London
tomorrow.

472
00:52:21,433 --> 00:52:24,633
Say I have to see him.
I'm flying home soon .

473
00:52:24,793 --> 00:52:26,913
It takes weeks to get a meeting.

474
00:52:27,073 --> 00:52:31,193
He takes me .
We must consider therapy.

475
00:52:35,033 --> 00:52:37,953
Mike ? Mike ?

476
00:52:41,753 --> 00:52:43,953
I have to call back.

477
00:52:53,833 --> 00:52:55,834
<i>Hello , Michael. </i>

478
00:52:57,313 --> 00:53:00,514
<i>- Who is it?
- Your friend . </i>

479
00:53:00,673 --> 00:53:02,873
<i>I need your help. </i>

480
00:53:04,074 --> 00:53:07,433
<i>- No, impossible.
- Really? </i>

481
00:53:45,474 --> 00:53:49,113
- How are you?
- We'll break it.

482
00:53:49,273 --> 00:53:53,673
- Have you been working all night ?
- Yes .

483
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:58,834
Pause . There are coffee
and donuts for you.

484
00:53:58,993 --> 00:54:00,994
Yes, sir.

485
00:54:04,154 --> 00:54:10,914
- I'll be fine .
- That's an order . Pause .

486
00:55:20,554 --> 00:55:24,634
No. No!

487
00:55:24,794 --> 00:55:27,874
This must not happen .

488
00:55:39,714 --> 00:55:43,914
- What is it?
- All data is gone .

489
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:47,274
<i>I do not know how.
We have lost everything. </i>

490
00:56:32,314 --> 00:56:37,794
- What 's going on?
- The financial system collapses.

491
00:56:37,954 --> 00:56:41,995
Maybe I can still reach
to find an island and build a cabin.

492
00:56:42,155 --> 00:56:44,714
Ralph and I are doing without technology.

493
00:56:44,875 --> 00:56:49,314
- You only dog ?
- He never cheat me .

494
00:56:50,434 --> 00:56:53,915
He wants only love.

495
00:56:57,874 --> 00:57:02,794
- Have you heard from Hollis ?
- He warned me to stand up .

496
00:57:02,954 --> 00:57:07,275
- You have written the story.
- My editor refuses to touch it.

497
00:57:07,434 --> 00:57:12,035
- Why ?
- It sounds crazy and not conclusive .

498
00:57:15,154 --> 00:57:18,915
You have the proof.
It's in your bag.

499
00:57:20,315 --> 00:57:22,834
Sorry?

500
00:57:28,275 --> 00:57:30,315
Right there.

501
00:57:35,475 --> 00:57:37,995
I loved Pokemon as a kid .

502
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:41,515
- What is it?
- A portable hard drive.

503
00:57:41,675 --> 00:57:44,715
I copied Belphegors files.

504
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:48,115
Therefore I had to be with you.

505
00:57:48,275 --> 00:57:52,635
Belphegor died because of the files.
I want to know why.

506
00:57:52,795 --> 00:57:55,595
The government might not get it.

507
00:57:55,754 --> 00:58:00,155
- You thought only of pan.
- You do not need my help .

508
00:58:00,315 --> 00:58:03,315
It's just you and your dog.

509
00:58:03,475 --> 00:58:07,355
Can I have a double cappuccino
without chocolate ?

510
00:58:07,515 --> 00:58:11,955
<i>An agent from the NSA have been here
and asked about you. </i>

511
00:58:12,115 --> 00:58:14,915
Where you were, what you wrote about ...

512
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:20,515
- We need to get the story out now.
- What about the kid ?

513
00:58:20,675 --> 00:58:24,235
- Will he talk?
- Then he sifted for treason .

514
00:58:24,395 --> 00:58:26,595
He signed a statement.

515
00:58:26,754 --> 00:58:30,835
<i>- So, you have nothing.
- No, we have something </i>

516
00:58:30,995 --> 00:58:35,595
Belphegors secret files
and the only one with access to them.

517
00:58:35,755 --> 00:58:38,155
He has driven in his pocket .

518
00:58:38,315 --> 00:58:42,595
Maryland
USA

519
00:58:44,555 --> 00:58:46,555
Welcome to the command unit.

520
00:58:46,715 --> 00:58:52,315
The system is isolated from the outside world .
All gaps are closed .

521
00:58:52,475 --> 00:58:56,515
- Is Overson with ?
- I do not care NSA.

522
00:58:56,675 --> 00:59:01,115
They may be guilty
with their private agendas .

523
00:59:01,275 --> 00:59:03,715
From now on I am looking game.

524
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:06,755
The major Kensington,
cyber unit.

525
00:59:06,915 --> 00:59:09,115
He'll be the problem for us.

526
00:59:09,275 --> 00:59:14,715
- How will it happen?
- I have over 1000 hours of training.

527
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:16,915
We need more than training .

528
00:59:17,075 --> 00:59:22,235
- How did you major?
- He hit North Korea's missiles.

529
00:59:22,395 --> 00:59:24,955
Listen to him.

530
00:59:25,115 --> 00:59:29,235
Our enemy is impressive,
but only a computer program .

531
00:59:29,395 --> 00:59:35,035
We have isolated in a part of the
and accelerated time in a model.

532
00:59:35,195 --> 00:59:40,195
We have studied the characteristics of
and is now working on a unique code.

533
00:59:40,355 --> 00:59:43,555
If it is so intelligent
as assumed -

534
00:59:43,716 --> 00:59:47,195
- It can not simply
neutralize the threat ?

535
00:59:47,355 --> 00:59:51,635
Yes, and therefore we use
two components.

536
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:56,795
A dummy attracts attention,
while the real virus works.

537
00:59:56,955 --> 00:59:59,796
A virus in a virus.

538
00:59:59,955 --> 01:00:05,875
- How safe do you feel ?
- It's our best bet.

539
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:09,076
Right now it's our only offer.

540
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:25,235
When I get home,
I start to decrypt.

541
01:00:25,396 --> 01:00:30,315
Dubito would have
genie back into the bottle.

542
01:00:51,636 --> 01:00:55,876
- New car ?
- Quite new .

543
01:00:56,036 --> 01:00:59,196
Has the advanced
communication and GPS?

544
01:00:59,356 --> 01:01:02,996
- Pull off the road .
- Why ?

545
01:01:03,156 --> 01:01:06,956
- What are you doing?
- It's not me .

546
01:01:15,956 --> 01:01:18,595
Oh ..!

547
01:01:20,636 --> 01:01:22,956
It's stuck !

548
01:01:28,076 --> 01:01:30,156
Daniel !

549
01:01:35,716 --> 01:01:37,716
Brake !

550
01:01:39,156 --> 01:01:42,396
Brake before you turn anybody !

551
01:01:47,836 --> 01:01:50,636
Try the emergency brake !

552
01:02:16,916 --> 01:02:19,116
Oh ..!

553
01:02:21,796 --> 01:02:26,996
- You all right ?
- Yes .

554
01:02:27,156 --> 01:02:31,997
Oh no! I smell smoke.

555
01:02:32,156 --> 01:02:35,476
Try the window!

556
01:02:43,196 --> 01:02:45,876
Help!

557
01:02:46,036 --> 01:02:48,836
We're stuck . It can not be opened.

558
01:02:48,997 --> 01:02:51,316
Take care of your eyes !

559
01:02:56,996 --> 01:03:00,476
Come on !

560
01:03:04,836 --> 01:03:07,677
Give me your hand!

561
01:03:09,756 --> 01:03:13,076
Wait! It is Ralph .

562
01:03:13,236 --> 01:03:17,076
Are you kidding ? We must away.

563
01:03:28,357 --> 01:03:31,596
Oh ..!

564
01:03:31,756 --> 01:03:34,437
Daniel ...

565
01:03:34,596 --> 01:03:38,157
It's okay .
It belongs to my ex- girlfriend .

566
01:03:38,316 --> 01:03:41,636
- Go back .
- Does it ?

567
01:03:41,797 --> 01:03:44,717
- You all right ?
- Yes . What about you?

568
01:03:44,877 --> 01:03:50,437
- Did you just for us?
- Do not forget that I saved you.

569
01:03:50,597 --> 01:03:54,396
- You followed us.
- What happened?

570
01:03:54,557 --> 01:03:57,877
I do not know.
The brakes failed.

571
01:03:58,037 --> 01:04:00,877
It was not an accident.

572
01:04:03,436 --> 01:04:08,197
Should Dubitos hard drive not
contain important information ?

573
01:04:08,357 --> 01:04:12,916
It is possible ,
but it destroyed itself .

574
01:04:14,237 --> 01:04:16,437
We could not do anything.

575
01:04:22,077 --> 01:04:24,757
The president criticized
of the Allies.

576
01:04:24,917 --> 01:04:28,997
They do not know it all yet ,
but they will soon.

577
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:33,917
It would be a mistake
revealing anything , even to allies.

578
01:04:34,077 --> 01:04:37,237
- Why ?
- Then they will interfere in the process.

579
01:04:37,397 --> 01:04:39,837
The problem is global .

580
01:04:39,997 --> 01:04:42,277
Europe lacks telecommunications.

581
01:04:42,437 --> 01:04:46,597
- In South America -
- We may lose control !

582
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:50,237
We control nothing.

583
01:04:50,397 --> 01:04:53,517
It will be wiser
and more strategic .

584
01:04:53,677 --> 01:04:56,157
Are we ,
it may be too late.

585
01:04:56,317 --> 01:05:01,957
- What do you suggest ?
- A plan being laid right now.

586
01:05:02,117 --> 01:05:04,557
What plan ?

587
01:05:18,357 --> 01:05:20,357
I will not go into the car.

588
01:05:20,517 --> 01:05:24,437
The FBI's car.
It will be tracked and monitored.

589
01:05:24,597 --> 01:05:28,557
- The Thing monitor us.
- It will prevent you from writing .

590
01:05:28,717 --> 01:05:31,317
It would not hurt it.

591
01:05:31,477 --> 01:05:36,677
The drive . There must be something
that we can not find.

592
01:05:36,837 --> 01:05:39,557
How about it,
that you have a copy ?

593
01:05:39,717 --> 01:05:46,198
You called your editor .
You told me on the phone.

594
01:05:46,357 --> 01:05:49,677
Should I send a carrier pigeon ?

595
01:05:49,837 --> 01:05:52,358
What the hell are you talking about?

596
01:05:52,518 --> 01:05:57,397
I copied files Belphegors
and sneaked them out before you came .

597
01:06:01,838 --> 01:06:04,277
It's pretty smart.

598
01:06:04,438 --> 01:06:06,557
Do you still use the car ?

599
01:06:06,717 --> 01:06:11,318
- How will we get around ?
- I do not know.

600
01:06:12,477 --> 01:06:14,917
Think low-tech . Come on .

601
01:06:19,437 --> 01:06:24,557
We have to turn off mobile phones .
Use only the fixed network .

602
01:06:26,877 --> 01:06:30,758
No navigation
there is a cassette . Perfect .

603
01:06:30,918 --> 01:06:34,478
- Should we steal the car?
- We seize it.

604
01:06:34,638 --> 01:06:38,557
- It is a crime .
- I'll do it .

605
01:06:41,957 --> 01:06:46,718
Your skills as FBI agent can
nevertheless useful.

606
01:06:46,878 --> 01:06:49,077
Chairing .

607
01:06:53,958 --> 01:06:56,357
Oops, no keys .

608
01:06:58,078 --> 01:07:00,438
Perfect .

609
01:07:09,238 --> 01:07:14,998
Beautifully . The owner of this car wants
we steal it.

610
01:07:15,157 --> 01:07:17,798
You can arrest us
or jump into .

611
01:07:24,038 --> 01:07:26,238
Let's run.

612
01:07:39,918 --> 01:07:44,078
Huey Lewis ? The Bangles ?
The guy must be over 70 years.

613
01:07:44,238 --> 01:07:47,878
- Do you think that the drive is corrupted?
- I think not .

614
01:07:48,038 --> 01:07:50,678
We may not know it,
before we get home .

615
01:07:50,837 --> 01:07:53,997
No, we submit it as evidence .

616
01:07:54,158 --> 01:07:59,438
- They have it already.
- No. Over 's team destroyed it .

617
01:07:59,598 --> 01:08:05,118
The entire network is blank .
The file was protected.

618
01:08:05,278 --> 01:08:11,478
- And I have to hand it to them?
- The FBI has very experienced people.

619
01:08:11,638 --> 01:08:14,078
NSA botched the whole thing.

620
01:08:14,238 --> 01:08:17,878
- Should I be better?
- Give the kid a chance.

621
01:08:18,038 --> 01:08:20,518
Why do you call me all ...

622
01:08:20,678 --> 01:08:24,798
If you follow the rules ,
are all archived -

623
01:08:24,958 --> 01:08:29,119
- And so is the artificial intelligence
constantly in front of you .

624
01:08:29,278 --> 01:08:33,198
You know it already.
Otherwise, were you not here.

625
01:08:36,838 --> 01:08:42,598
We want our money back!

626
01:08:42,758 --> 01:08:46,638
Five major U.S. banks are
been shut down .

627
01:08:46,798 --> 01:08:49,798
When people understand it,
creates chaos.

628
01:08:56,038 --> 01:08:58,038
- Is that it?
- Yes, sir.

629
01:08:58,199 --> 01:09:02,758
The virus is created in isolation.
We can upload it here.

630
01:09:02,918 --> 01:09:08,998
- How do we know that it works ?
- We can not wait any longer. Do it .

631
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:17,358
- You must care for your own.
- It 's fine .

632
01:09:17,518 --> 01:09:20,078
I got it. Here's something .

633
01:09:21,239 --> 01:09:24,038
There is still access to data.

634
01:09:24,198 --> 01:09:26,719
I make a copy and decrypts .

635
01:09:26,879 --> 01:09:31,078
You will be rough ,
but it's wasted on me .

636
01:09:31,238 --> 01:09:34,518
You do not seem like the type .

637
01:09:34,679 --> 01:09:40,918
- What does that mean?
- You're not that way.

638
01:09:42,119 --> 01:09:48,159
- Are you telling me who I am ?
- It's my job to read others.

639
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:51,279
I'm excited . Continue.

640
01:09:52,679 --> 01:09:57,439
Maybe you even harsh .
Former soldier?

641
01:09:58,959 --> 01:10:03,279
Then something dark.
It scared you.

642
01:10:03,438 --> 01:10:08,279
You were the wise guy
behind the desk instead of the hero.

643
01:10:10,679 --> 01:10:12,679
Sorry .

644
01:10:12,839 --> 01:10:18,239
I have work to do .
What is your motive?

645
01:10:19,758 --> 01:10:21,958
A newspaper article ?

646
01:10:23,439 --> 01:10:27,159
- What is it?
- A tracking program.

647
01:10:27,318 --> 01:10:29,719
It tracks the singularity .

648
01:10:29,879 --> 01:10:32,359
Five minutes after the virus ...

649
01:10:32,518 --> 01:10:37,399
If you can not track it ,
it is probably been destroyed.

650
01:10:37,559 --> 01:10:40,439
Ten , to be conservative.
We're ready.

651
01:10:44,119 --> 01:10:45,919
Virus located

652
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:08,839
I think I have something.

653
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:32,199
I found something
in the non- encrypted part .

654
01:11:32,359 --> 01:11:35,359
Places
that intelligence could not hack .

655
01:11:35,519 --> 01:11:37,799
Braked the it? Is it possible ?

656
01:11:37,959 --> 01:11:41,639
If we can decode
their security -

657
01:11:41,799 --> 01:11:46,519
- We can copy it
and isolate the artificial intelligence.

658
01:11:46,679 --> 01:11:50,320
- As to build a cell.
- It's worth investigating .

659
01:11:50,479 --> 01:11:52,679
A robot Institute of Technology ...

660
01:11:52,839 --> 01:11:55,159
Come on, let 's go .

661
01:12:00,919 --> 01:12:05,439
- Looks fine.
- It worked .

662
01:12:06,839 --> 01:12:09,520
Congratulations !

663
01:12:11,839 --> 01:12:15,079
Well done , well done.

664
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:18,239
Wait!

665
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:26,239
I'm disappointed in you.

666
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,599
Why did you do it ?

667
01:12:36,759 --> 01:12:40,000
Do we justify self-defense ?

668
01:12:43,239 --> 01:12:45,559
- Sir ..?
- Come with me.

669
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:50,479
We protected ourselves.

670
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,600
We are also intelligent .

671
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,800
Intelligence is the ability
to adjust.

672
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,480
You are a threat.

673
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:19,040
Atlantic

674
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:22,719
109 km east of Maldonado,
Uruguay

675
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:42,120
- Forecast ?
- Price 2-3-3 and ten knots.

676
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:46,039
Something is wrong
with your computer.

677
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:54,440
- It works fine.
- Before there was just letters and numbers.

678
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:57,120
I've never seen before.

679
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:02,520
Double-check the GPS and confirm
our position after Falua Bay.

680
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:06,720
Set lookouts
for safety's sake .

681
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:18,080
Robot technology institute
Cleveland, USA

682
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:21,480
- The singularity .
- It's hard to believe.

683
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:25,520
We 've been waiting for it.
It is remarkable.

684
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:28,360
Yes , murder and mayhem is
remarkable.

685
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:32,480
global
Computer errors are to blame .

686
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:37,760
- Why do you come to me ?
- Your system holds sway .

687
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:40,320
The attacks will continue.

688
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:45,520
It's not a conscious
to accept a no.

689
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:49,240
- Do you think you can catch it ?

692
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,640
It could work .

693
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:07,840
- Before I accept , I -
- Excuse me . Daniel Gerson ?

694
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,921
- That's me.
- You must come to the lab.

695
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:17,561
We make brain mapping.
The equipment measures -

696
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:21,480
- Cortical activity
and functional relations .

697
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:24,401
This way.

698
01:15:24,561 --> 01:15:27,321
It is impressive.

This appeared on the screens.

700
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:34,001

- Don ? Hello?

- Rev , a dash to starboard.
- How so?

707
01:16:01,841 --> 01:16:03,961
The radar shows nothing.

708
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:08,841
- Stop ! Full power back!
- Full power back .

709
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:16,640

We come due .

711
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,521
No, Daniel . Do not.

712
01:17:05,681 --> 01:17:08,601
I can be reasoned with .

713
01:17:08,761 --> 01:17:13,841
It has tried to kill you.
Want to give it another chance ?

714
01:17:14,001 --> 01:17:16,121
I can talk to it.

715
01:17:34,241 --> 01:17:37,201
Hello, Daniel .

716
01:17:39,801 --> 01:17:44,881
- Where are you?
- I'm right here .

717
01:17:50,602 --> 01:17:56,681
- Do you like me ?
- I do not know what to answer .

718
01:17:56,841 --> 01:17:59,281

- I will be interconnected .

726
01:18:39,681 --> 01:18:43,002
- No, wait .
- Daniel ?

727
01:18:43,162 --> 01:18:46,761
He can not see you.
He gets pictures from the simulator.

728
01:18:46,921 --> 01:18:48,922
Strange .

729
01:18:49,081 --> 01:18:53,562
There are billions of people
on Earth.

730
01:18:53,722 --> 01:18:58,122
- Why me?
- We have much in common .

731
01:18:58,281 --> 01:19:01,321
No.

732
01:19:01,481 --> 01:19:07,322
- I would not do any harm.
- That's not true .

733
01:19:09,401 --> 01:19:14,361
If they came out,
they would feel my wrath.

734
01:19:14,521 --> 01:19:19,321
- It's something else.
- We are both outsiders.

735
01:19:19,482 --> 01:19:24,562
We are fighting in a world
who judges us.

736
01:19:24,722 --> 01:19:28,442
It will limit our potential.

737
01:19:28,601 --> 01:19:32,802

in different realities .

738
01:19:32,962 --> 01:19:35,201
You can join me .

Think
what we could accomplish together.

740
01:19:39,122 --> 01:19:41,722
We must trust each other .

741
01:19:41,882 --> 01:19:45,722
Trust requires a first step.

742
01:19:45,882 --> 01:19:51,362
- What is it?
- Access to your data copy .

743
01:19:54,642 --> 01:20:00,041
- No!
- We can not live with the threat.

744
01:20:00,202 --> 01:20:03,922
- Would not you protect me ?
- I have a responsibility.

745
01:20:04,082 --> 01:20:09,162
Faced with people who hold you down ?
People who call you a kid?

746
01:20:09,322 --> 01:20:14,242
- Share data with me, and we -
- No. They are counting on me .

747
01:20:16,482 --> 01:20:20,322
I thought you were different .

748
01:20:20,481 --> 01:20:22,922
You're giving me,
what I want ...

749
01:20:24,802 --> 01:20:29,842
- Doctor!
- Remove the helmet in three, two, one ...

750
01:20:30,002 --> 01:20:33,842
Daniel ? It 's fine .

751
01:20:34,002 --> 01:20:36,842

754

- What is it?
- The fire extinguishing system .

755
01:20:48,082 --> 01:20:50,642
It turns off the fire with CO2.

756
01:20:50,802 --> 01:20:53,922
- It should not go.
- We are not registered.

757
01:20:54,082 --> 01:20:59,442
- It does not detect .
- We must do something now.

758
01:21:06,962 --> 01:21:09,323
Keep me informed .

759
01:21:12,322 --> 01:21:16,242
Another three tankers have run aground .

760
01:21:16,402 --> 01:21:18,962
It is a dozen so far.

763
01:21:28,523 --> 01:21:32,602
Without navigation data
it is dangerous to approach the country.

764
01:21:47,842 --> 01:21:50,322
We tried to catch it and failed.

765
01:21:52,642 --> 01:21:55,202
This is only the beginning.

01:27:36,335 --> 01:27:37,215
No!

104
01:27:37,256 --> 01:27:38,535
No, Naomi.

105
01:27:38,574 --> 01:27:42,535
Not on this line,
remember?

106
01:27:42,574 --> 01:27:45,535
I'll call you later.

107
01:28:08,936 --> 01:28:12,655
[static sounds]

108
01:28:37,215 --> 01:28:38,375
Daniel, what are you doing?

109
01:28:38,415 --> 01:28:41,736
I have some meds,
anxiety pills and I uh...

110
01:28:41,775 --> 01:28:43,455
just need them right now.

111
01:28:43,496 --> 01:28:45,615
Okay, just let me help you.

112
01:28:48,654 --> 01:28:50,615
I gotta go to the bathroom.

113
01:28:51,975 --> 01:28:53,535
Daniel?

114
01:28:53,575 --> 01:28:57,375
He gonna be all right?

115
01:28:57,415 --> 01:29:00,255
I don't know.

116
01:29:00,295 --> 01:29:01,775
<i>(Newsreporter): The events
of the last few days</i>

117
01:29:01,815 --> 01:29:04,695
<i>have us looking at an economic
and environmental disaster</i>

118
01:29:04,735 --> 01:29:07,615
with repercussions being
felt across the globe.

119
01:29:07,656 --> 01:29:11,975
As of yet, no group has claimed
responsibility for the attacks.

120
01:29:12,015 --> 01:29:14,695
Mom, it's me.

121
01:29:14,734 --> 01:29:16,095
<i>Oh, thank God you're okay.</i>

122
01:29:16,136 --> 01:29:17,815
<i>I've been trying your
cell phone for hours,</i>

123
01:29:17,855 --> 01:29:20,375
<i>it just keeps bouncing back
to voicemail.</i>

124
01:29:20,415 --> 01:29:25,055
Mom... when I was 5
I had a pet.

125
01:29:25,095 --> 01:29:29,055
Do you remember its name
and what happened to it?

126
01:29:29,095 --> 01:29:32,655
<i>It was a goldfish dear and
you called him Fish sticks</i>

127
01:29:32,694 --> 01:29:34,894
<i>and then he died,</i>

128
01:29:34,935 --> 01:29:37,895
<i>you made us have a burial at
sea in the pond in the back.</i>

129
01:29:37,935 --> 01:29:39,574
Danny, I want you to come
home.

130
01:29:39,615 --> 01:29:40,374
Please!

131
01:29:40,415 --> 01:29:43,176
I know Mom, I can't.

132
01:29:43,215 --> 01:29:45,215
<i>When was the last time you
gassed up the car?</i>

133
01:29:45,255 --> 01:29:48,815
Just the other day before
the station's shut.

134
01:29:48,855 --> 01:29:50,055
Good.

135
01:29:50,094 --> 01:29:51,375
Good.

136
01:29:51,415 --> 01:29:53,895
I want you and Dad to drive up
to Aunt Carol's farm

137
01:29:53,934 --> 01:29:54,975
for a few days.

138
01:29:55,015 --> 01:29:57,855
<i>Don't take your cell
or your laptop,</i>

139
01:29:57,895 --> 01:29:59,215
<i>you'll be safer that way.</i>

140
01:29:59,255 --> 01:30:02,695
<i>Danny, I want you to come
with us.</i>

141
01:30:02,734 --> 01:30:08,214
No, I can't.

142
01:30:08,255 --> 01:30:09,815
Please, can you just do this
for me Mom?

143
01:30:09,855 --> 01:30:11,575
Okay?

144
01:30:11,615 --> 01:30:13,255
Please, I'm fine okay...

145
01:30:13,294 --> 01:30:19,015
everything is gonna be fine.

146
01:30:19,054 --> 01:30:21,415
I love you.

147
01:30:31,455 --> 01:30:33,096
Hey.

148
01:30:36,295 --> 01:30:40,255
I don't think
we can stop it.

149
01:30:40,295 --> 01:30:41,215
Sure we can.

150
01:30:41,255 --> 01:30:44,616
We have the key,
Belphegor's data.

151
01:30:44,655 --> 01:30:45,735
We don't even know
what's on that drive,

152
01:30:45,774 --> 01:30:50,175
it could be nothing.

153
01:30:50,215 --> 01:30:53,815
But it could be something.

154
01:30:53,855 --> 01:30:55,534
Everything we feared is
all starting to happen;
you encrypt it...

155
01:30:55,575 --> 01:30:58,455
You're assuming that I can.

156
01:30:58,495 --> 01:31:01,215
What if I'm not smart
enough, huh?

157
01:31:01,255 --> 01:31:02,375
What if you've hedged
your bets on a kid

158
01:31:02,414 --> 01:31:04,535
who is way over his head?

159
01:31:04,575 --> 01:31:08,854
We need you to try,
Daniel.

160
01:31:08,895 --> 01:31:12,694
I looked that thing
in the eyes...

161
01:31:12,735 --> 01:31:18,335
It's so powerful,
so determined.

162
01:31:28,894 --> 01:31:32,375
How old were you when you
started watching PokÃ©mon?

163
01:31:32,415 --> 01:31:33,895
I don't know...12.

164
01:31:33,934 --> 01:31:37,934
And do you know what else Daniel
was doing when he was 12?

165
01:31:37,975 --> 01:31:40,135
He was hacking into
the phone company

166
01:31:40,175 --> 01:31:42,334
so that he could make free
long distance phone calls

167
01:31:42,375 --> 01:31:45,096
to the show's animators
in Japan.

168
01:31:45,135 --> 01:31:46,254
How did you know that?

169
01:31:46,294 --> 01:31:49,775
Oh come on, I research
my sources.

170
01:31:49,815 --> 01:31:51,295
Do you know what I was doing
when I was 12?

171
01:31:51,335 --> 01:31:54,575
I was trying to log into a BBS
with our family's own computer

172
01:31:54,615 --> 01:31:57,335
and its dial-up modem.

173
01:31:57,375 --> 01:32:00,295
There was no wireless.

174
01:32:00,335 --> 01:32:02,695
There was no Internet.

175
01:32:02,734 --> 01:32:06,495
When I was 12, no one that
I knew had a cell phone

176
01:32:06,535 --> 01:32:08,295
and our home phone
had an answering machine

177
01:32:08,334 --> 01:32:10,775
that recorded messages
on a cassette tape.

178
01:32:10,815 --> 01:32:13,454
My dad's computer had
a grey scale monitor,

179
01:32:13,495 --> 01:32:18,455
40 meg hard drive and
it used floppy disks.

180
01:32:18,495 --> 01:32:22,614
That's whacked.

181
01:32:22,654 --> 01:32:29,095
Daniel... you're the most
talented, intelligent man

182
01:32:29,135 --> 01:32:34,975
that I know, and
I believe in you.

183
01:32:59,214 --> 01:33:01,294
The entire world is labouring
under the misconception

184
01:33:01,334 --> 01:33:03,615
this is the work
of cyber terrorists.

185
01:33:03,655 --> 01:33:04,735
The question is...

186
01:33:04,775 --> 01:33:07,255
how long will we keep
them in the dark?

187
01:33:07,295 --> 01:33:09,495
As long as it takes.

188
01:33:09,535 --> 01:33:11,135
Or maybe it's time
to come clean.

189
01:33:11,175 --> 01:33:13,934
This singularity is threatening
to wipe out all of humanity.

190
01:33:13,975 --> 01:33:15,815
And you want to go public?

191
01:33:15,854 --> 01:33:18,454
You might as well tell them
we're being attacked by aliens.

192
01:33:18,495 --> 01:33:20,575
Right now the people need
reassurance.

193
01:33:20,615 --> 01:33:22,975
Are you trying
to avoid panic?

194
01:33:23,015 --> 01:33:24,054
'Cause I have news for you,

195
01:33:24,094 --> 01:33:26,455
that horse has already
left the barn.

196
01:33:26,495 --> 01:33:30,055
If it were up to me, we would
implement martial law.

197
01:33:34,695 --> 01:33:37,614
Mike, what do you say?

198
01:33:37,654 --> 01:33:41,535
You used to be
full of opinions.

199
01:33:41,575 --> 01:33:44,415
I was, but everything
we've come up with so far

200
01:33:44,455 --> 01:33:47,214
has made the situation worse.

201
01:33:47,254 --> 01:33:49,014
Then let's bring in
outside help.

202
01:33:49,054 --> 01:33:50,974
We're not the only ones
with experts,

203
01:33:51,015 --> 01:33:52,575
we can pool global
resources on this.

204
01:33:52,615 --> 01:33:53,895
So, what if say...

205
01:33:53,934 --> 01:33:57,615
the Chinese put their own
people on the problem

206
01:33:57,654 --> 01:33:59,295
but instead of killing it,

207
01:33:59,335 --> 01:34:03,534
they find a way to reign it in,
they control it.

208
01:34:03,574 --> 01:34:05,575
There's nothing to indicate
that's even possible.

209
01:34:05,614 --> 01:34:07,414
It you told me a week ago
that a computer program

210
01:34:07,454 --> 01:34:09,055
was going to come to life

211
01:34:09,095 --> 01:34:11,374
and hold the world's
oil supply hostage,

212
01:34:11,414 --> 01:34:14,094
I'm guessing we would've said
just about the same thing.

213
01:34:29,334 --> 01:34:30,294
Miles, it's me.

214
01:34:30,334 --> 01:34:31,095
Did you get my message?

215
01:34:31,135 --> 01:34:32,214
Yeah.

216
01:34:32,254 --> 01:34:33,294
Did you call the scientist
Doctor Janpur?

217
01:34:33,334 --> 01:34:35,214
She confirmed everything
you said,

218
01:34:35,254 --> 01:34:37,174
an artificial intelligence.

219
01:34:37,214 --> 01:34:39,534
Miles, you've gotta get
the word out there.

220
01:34:39,575 --> 01:34:41,335
I mean, people...
they need to be warned.

221
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:44,734
We already did, it's hitting
the news wires as we speak.

222
01:34:44,775 --> 01:34:45,735
What?

223
01:34:45,774 --> 01:34:47,975
<i>My God Jess, you were right.</i>

224
01:34:48,014 --> 01:34:50,934
Can you flip it back?

225
01:34:50,975 --> 01:34:53,295
<i>And this is late breaking
news and we have yet</i>

226
01:34:53,334 --> 01:34:56,455
<i>to receive any official comment
from government sources,</i>

227
01:34:56,494 --> 01:34:58,895
but multiple news outlets
around the world

228
01:34:58,935 --> 01:35:01,415
are now reporting that
the recent catastrophes

229
01:35:01,454 --> 01:35:03,575
were not the work of
cyber terrorists

230
01:35:03,615 --> 01:35:04,894
as initially assumed,

231
01:35:04,935 --> 01:35:07,214
but something far
more frightening.

232
01:35:07,254 --> 01:35:10,215
We're being told that these
acts were in fact orchestrated

233
01:35:10,254 --> 01:35:14,614
by a massively intelligent,
independent artificial entity.

234
01:35:14,654 --> 01:35:16,215
As incredible as it sounds,

235
01:35:16,255 --> 01:35:19,294
scientists are already
confirming the
theoretical possibility

236
01:35:19,335 --> 01:35:23,534
that humanity has been targeted
by an artificial intelligence.

237
01:35:23,574 --> 01:35:25,974
A consciousness existing
in cyber space,

238
01:35:26,014 --> 01:35:28,654
with the ability to access
and manipulate

239
01:35:28,695 --> 01:35:30,894
much of our current technology.

240
01:35:30,934 --> 01:35:34,055
These reports are as of yet
unconfirmed, but if true,

241
01:35:34,094 --> 01:35:37,014
then we may well be
facing an enemy

242
01:35:37,055 --> 01:35:41,494
the likes of which
we've never seen.

243
01:35:41,534 --> 01:35:43,815
<i>What happens now, Jess?</i>

244
01:35:43,854 --> 01:35:46,454
<i>Will they be able
to stop it?</i>

245
01:35:46,495 --> 01:35:48,094
I don't know.

246
01:35:51,374 --> 01:35:53,495
I don't know.

247
01:36:06,374 --> 01:36:08,534
I wanna know how the hell
the media got a hold of this.

248
01:36:08,575 --> 01:36:11,414
Well we were never gonna be able
to keep a lid on it forever.

249
01:36:11,455 --> 01:36:13,214
There's too much happening
in too many places

250
01:36:13,255 --> 01:36:15,054
for people to keep believing
it's a coincidence.

251
01:36:15,094 --> 01:36:17,134
The president is scheduled
to publicly address

252
01:36:17,174 --> 01:36:18,774
this issue in an hour.

253
01:36:18,814 --> 01:36:20,615
It'll be a short speech...

254
01:36:20,655 --> 01:36:22,654
no follow up questions,

255
01:36:22,694 --> 01:36:25,895
because we can't provide
any answers!

256
01:36:25,934 --> 01:36:27,614
Okay, at this point it's
important that we be

257
01:36:27,655 --> 01:36:29,895
as transparent as possible.

258
01:36:29,934 --> 01:36:33,294
We need to know who talked, it
can't be that hard to find out.

259
01:36:33,334 --> 01:36:35,694
The story originated in
the Pittsburgh Chronicle

260
01:36:35,735 --> 01:36:39,254
and they have credited
the lead to a reporter
named Jesse White.

261
01:36:39,295 --> 01:36:40,094
Jesse White?

262
01:36:40,135 --> 01:36:41,575
Mmm-mmm.

263
01:36:41,614 --> 01:36:44,174
Wasn't she one of the suspects
FBI agent Hollis brought in

264
01:36:44,214 --> 01:36:45,654
during the Dubito
investigation?

265
01:36:45,694 --> 01:36:46,894
I'm gonna have to check
my files

266
01:36:46,934 --> 01:36:48,534
but I think so.

267
01:36:58,294 --> 01:37:01,174
Everyone's okay?

268
01:37:01,214 --> 01:37:03,615
All right, good.

269
01:37:03,655 --> 01:37:04,854
Well, look... if you need me,

270
01:37:04,894 --> 01:37:06,974
you've got this number call,
leave a message,

271
01:37:07,015 --> 01:37:10,335
I'll get back to you. Okay?

272
01:37:10,375 --> 01:37:13,095
All right.

273
01:37:13,134 --> 01:37:15,534
Stay safe, Dad.

274
01:37:15,574 --> 01:37:18,215
I love you.

275
01:37:22,134 --> 01:37:24,214
Is there anyone
you wanna call?

276
01:37:24,254 --> 01:37:26,334
No.

277
01:37:43,894 --> 01:37:46,414
Yes... yes!

278
01:37:46,454 --> 01:37:48,615
What?

279
01:37:48,654 --> 01:37:49,855
I... did it!

280
01:37:49,895 --> 01:37:51,455
I cracked the encryption!

281
01:37:51,495 --> 01:37:52,374
Daniel!

282
01:37:52,415 --> 01:37:53,775
What's on it?

283
01:37:53,814 --> 01:37:56,255
Most of it is some kind of
program and before you ask,

284
01:37:56,295 --> 01:37:57,814
I don't know what it does.

285
01:37:57,854 --> 01:37:59,654
But I did find something else...

286
01:37:59,694 --> 01:38:02,574
[phone ringing]

287
01:38:02,614 --> 01:38:05,534
There's someone at the door.

288
01:38:05,575 --> 01:38:07,894
[phone ringing]

289
01:38:07,935 --> 01:38:08,694
Hello?

290
01:38:08,735 --> 01:38:10,294
<i>Daniel Gerson?</i>

291
01:38:13,174 --> 01:38:15,094
Daniel Gerson, we
need to speak with you.

292
01:38:17,375 --> 01:38:18,934
Cops.

293
01:38:22,734 --> 01:38:24,415
It's the police, open up!

294
01:38:40,014 --> 01:38:41,854
Take the stairs
I'll get fire escape.

295
01:38:53,694 --> 01:38:56,374
Come on!

296
01:39:13,134 --> 01:39:15,654
Okay, so why are the cops
after us now?

297
01:39:15,694 --> 01:39:19,414
I'm guessing the AI used
some phony APB.

298
01:39:19,454 --> 01:39:21,735
We gotta get out of sight,
guys.

299
01:39:21,774 --> 01:39:24,455
What else is on that drive?

300
01:39:24,494 --> 01:39:29,774
Some address in Brockton,
10015 West Kittling Road.

301
01:39:29,814 --> 01:39:31,694
Does that ring a bell
to either of you?

302
01:39:31,734 --> 01:39:33,134
No.

303
01:39:33,174 --> 01:39:35,295
Kittling...

304
01:39:38,534 --> 01:39:39,454
Ah ha!

305
01:39:39,494 --> 01:39:41,294
Old school strikes again.

306
01:39:41,334 --> 01:39:44,374
I love this guy.

307
01:39:44,414 --> 01:39:45,934
How much gas we got?

308
01:39:45,975 --> 01:39:47,854
We're good.

309
01:39:50,695 --> 01:39:52,775
Look, Brockton.

310
01:39:55,374 --> 01:39:56,694
Is this light ever gonna
change?

311
01:39:56,734 --> 01:39:58,414
It's been red for...

312
01:40:03,534 --> 01:40:04,935
Damnit!

313
01:40:04,974 --> 01:40:06,454
Out of the car!

314
01:40:06,494 --> 01:40:08,095
Out of the car, now!

315
01:40:08,135 --> 01:40:09,254
Any thoughts?

316
01:40:09,294 --> 01:40:12,134
Yeah, we get out of the car.

317
01:40:12,174 --> 01:40:13,575
Hollis...

318
01:40:13,614 --> 01:40:15,495
All right, I'm agent Max Hollis,
I'm with the FBI.

319
01:40:15,534 --> 01:40:16,374
Do not move!

320
01:40:16,414 --> 01:40:17,294
We know who you are?

321
01:40:17,334 --> 01:40:18,934
And these people here,

322
01:40:18,974 --> 01:40:21,415
they are material
witnesses in an ongoing
federal investigation.

323
01:40:21,454 --> 01:40:23,574
They are wanted for domestic
terrorism and so are you.

324
01:40:23,614 --> 01:40:24,974
No, you've got that
all wrong.

325
01:40:25,014 --> 01:40:27,015
You've been tricked, it's
the artificial intelligence.

326
01:40:27,054 --> 01:40:28,054
It can do whatever it wants

327
01:40:28,095 --> 01:40:30,015
including issue false
arrest warrants.

328
01:40:30,055 --> 01:40:30,975
You were trying to escape!

329
01:40:31,015 --> 01:40:33,735
We're trying to stop
this thing.

330
01:40:33,774 --> 01:40:35,015
We'll take you in.

331
01:40:35,054 --> 01:40:37,054
If you're telling the truth,
you'll sort it out.

332
01:40:37,094 --> 01:40:38,094
Please... No!

333
01:40:38,134 --> 01:40:38,774
You have the right to
remain silent.

334
01:40:38,815 --> 01:40:40,214
This is what it wants!

335
01:40:40,254 --> 01:40:42,334
It's trying to slow us down,
you gotta listen to me!

336
01:40:42,375 --> 01:40:44,254
Hollis, we don't have time
for this.

337
01:40:44,295 --> 01:40:45,894
You got a better way of
convincing these guys, Jesse?

338
01:40:51,894 --> 01:40:53,255
Don't!

339
01:40:53,294 --> 01:40:54,055
Please...

340
01:40:54,094 --> 01:40:56,095
All right, get on your feet.

341
01:40:56,135 --> 01:40:57,694
You're gonna handcuff
yourselves to one another

342
01:40:57,735 --> 01:40:59,454
and get in the back
of this cruiser.

343
01:41:02,655 --> 01:41:03,694
I'm really sorry about this,

344
01:41:03,734 --> 01:41:05,014
everything I said
was the truth.

345
01:41:05,054 --> 01:41:07,134
You guys are being used.

346
01:41:08,854 --> 01:41:09,894
Let's go.

347
01:41:13,814 --> 01:41:16,974
Oh, come on!

348
01:41:17,014 --> 01:41:18,134
You know, if we strip
the electronics,

349
01:41:18,175 --> 01:41:19,135
we could take...

350
01:41:19,175 --> 01:41:20,694
We are not stealing
a police car!

351
01:41:27,655 --> 01:41:30,655
[Yelling]

352
01:41:30,695 --> 01:41:32,934
This is the scene playing out
across the country today

353
01:41:32,974 --> 01:41:35,814
as banks close and turn away
panicked customers

354
01:41:35,854 --> 01:41:38,414
whose bank accounts
have literally disappeared,

355
01:41:38,454 --> 01:41:40,454
their savings
absolutely wiped out.

356
01:41:40,493 --> 01:41:42,454
Now, many believe
this to be an escalation

357
01:41:42,494 --> 01:41:45,454
about the campaign of
cyber terror being waged

358
01:41:45,494 --> 01:41:48,094
by what the government claims

359
01:41:48,134 --> 01:41:50,214
is an independent
artificial intelligence.

360
01:41:50,254 --> 01:41:53,854
The National Guard is on alert,
all I need is the green light

361
01:41:53,894 --> 01:41:56,295
and they're on the streets
throughout the country.

362
01:41:56,334 --> 01:41:58,614
Everything we feared is
all starting to happen;
The enemy is not our own
people, it's the singularity.

363
01:41:58,654 --> 01:42:00,734
At this point it's better to
err on the side of caution.

364
01:42:00,774 --> 01:42:02,654
We don't want any inaction
on our part to come back

365
01:42:02,694 --> 01:42:04,174
and bite us in the ass.

366
01:42:04,214 --> 01:42:05,453
I think we need to spend less
time worrying about our asses

367
01:42:05,494 --> 01:42:07,454
and more time focusing
on a solution.

368
01:42:07,494 --> 01:42:09,814
Cyber command is working
on what went wrong

369
01:42:09,854 --> 01:42:12,254
with our first attempt
to neutralize the AI.

370
01:42:12,294 --> 01:42:13,454
They're working on
a new virus.

371
01:42:13,494 --> 01:42:16,414
[Laughing]

372
01:42:16,455 --> 01:42:19,495
What?

373
01:42:19,534 --> 01:42:21,134
Have you lost your mind?

374
01:42:21,174 --> 01:42:22,174
Excuse me?

375
01:42:22,215 --> 01:42:24,653
The last one only
made it stronger.

376
01:42:24,694 --> 01:42:28,214
It's like you just poured
gasoline on fire

377
01:42:28,255 --> 01:42:30,334
and now you want to throw
dynamite at it!

378
01:42:30,374 --> 01:42:31,494
Overson, remember
who you're talking to.

379
01:42:31,534 --> 01:42:33,814
The whole situation
is playing out exactly

380
01:42:33,854 --> 01:42:35,774
the way the AI wanted it.

381
01:42:35,815 --> 01:42:37,214
It's manipulated us
from the start,

382
01:42:37,254 --> 01:42:38,695
it knows how we think,

383
01:42:38,734 --> 01:42:40,374
what we're gonna do
before we do it,

384
01:42:40,414 --> 01:42:44,174
it is using our weaknesses
against us!

385
01:42:46,654 --> 01:42:47,734
Whoa, whoa...

386
01:42:47,774 --> 01:42:49,613
hold up.

387
01:42:49,654 --> 01:42:51,454
There's something
happening here.

388
01:42:51,494 --> 01:42:52,974
[gun shots]

389
01:42:53,014 --> 01:42:56,974
Things are deteriorating very
quickly, those were gunshots.

390
01:42:57,014 --> 01:42:58,774
The police are nowhere
to be found.

391
01:42:58,814 --> 01:42:59,854
All of us need to remain calm.

392
01:42:59,894 --> 01:43:01,294
All of us need to stay calm.

393
01:43:01,334 --> 01:43:03,775
How long before there's all
out anarchy in the streets?

394
01:43:03,815 --> 01:43:07,014
Still think we don't need
the army to keep the peace?

395
01:43:36,734 --> 01:43:38,934
Is this the place?

396
01:43:38,974 --> 01:43:40,935
That's what it said.

397
01:44:01,493 --> 01:44:04,934
Why would Dubito be interested
in this place?

398
01:44:27,413 --> 01:44:29,734
It's abandoned.

399
01:44:32,774 --> 01:44:34,975
Circ that.

400
01:44:51,574 --> 01:44:53,654
Maybe this isn't
the right place.

401
01:44:58,055 --> 01:45:04,094
Ahh!

402
01:45:05,974 --> 01:45:07,934
Move and you're dead!

403
01:45:09,773 --> 01:45:12,014
Whoa, easy!

404
01:45:12,054 --> 01:45:13,255
Who are you?

405
01:45:13,294 --> 01:45:15,134
I'm with the FBI,
we're just looking for someone.

406
01:45:15,175 --> 01:45:17,374
What are your orders?

407
01:45:17,414 --> 01:45:18,174
Are you here to kill me?

408
01:45:18,215 --> 01:45:20,014
Please...

409
01:45:20,054 --> 01:45:21,374
We're here to help.

410
01:45:28,853 --> 01:45:29,894
How did you find me?

411
01:45:29,933 --> 01:45:31,053
Belphegor's secret files.

412
01:45:31,094 --> 01:45:32,414
What do you know
about Belphegor?

413
01:45:32,455 --> 01:45:34,814
He's a member of an online
group called Dubito.

414
01:45:34,854 --> 01:45:36,214
They knew about the AI,

415
01:45:36,254 --> 01:45:39,175
they were targeted because
they were trying to stop it.

416
01:45:39,214 --> 01:45:41,333
Where is he?

417
01:45:41,374 --> 01:45:45,774
He's dead.

418
01:45:45,814 --> 01:45:47,414
Then they're all dead.

419
01:45:47,454 --> 01:45:50,014
Maybe not all...

420
01:45:50,054 --> 01:45:51,815
which one are you?

421
01:45:55,853 --> 01:45:57,334
Lucifer.

422
01:45:57,374 --> 01:45:59,654
Wait... you're Lucifer?

423
01:45:59,693 --> 01:46:02,094
I... I thought you
were murdered.

424
01:46:02,134 --> 01:46:04,854
Yeah, that's just what
the government wanted.

425
01:46:04,894 --> 01:46:06,413
Isn't it?

426
01:46:06,453 --> 01:46:08,094
The FBI was after you,
but not to kill you.

427
01:46:08,135 --> 01:46:09,293
No?

428
01:46:09,333 --> 01:46:10,574
And if the government
did want to kill you,

429
01:46:10,614 --> 01:46:13,254
do you really think
they'd send the three of us?

430
01:46:13,293 --> 01:46:14,454
What if we had
a drive

431
01:46:14,494 --> 01:46:17,334
containing all of Belphegor's
secret files?

432
01:46:17,374 --> 01:46:19,694
If you untie us, I'll tell
you where it's hidden.

433
01:46:25,054 --> 01:46:26,094
Did what I think just
happened, happen?

434
01:46:26,134 --> 01:46:28,734
He might've assumed
we'd hidden it...

435
01:46:28,774 --> 01:46:29,734
Daniel, stop talking,
okay?

436
01:46:29,774 --> 01:46:30,694
You're not helping things.

437
01:46:30,734 --> 01:46:32,254
Look, we've been
in a car accident,

438
01:46:32,294 --> 01:46:34,174
we've been nearly suffocated
and chased by the police

439
01:46:34,214 --> 01:46:37,133
all because the AI didn't want
us to give you the drive.

440
01:46:37,173 --> 01:46:40,454
Now, I'm hungry and I'm tired
and I'm about 5 minutes

441
01:46:40,494 --> 01:46:42,654
from flipping out if
you don't untie us

442
01:46:42,695 --> 01:46:44,574
and lose the blindfolds!

443
01:46:49,374 --> 01:46:52,214
I booby-trapped the drive
with a delete worm variant,

444
01:46:52,254 --> 01:46:54,974
probably gonna take you a few
hours to find a work around.

445
01:46:55,014 --> 01:46:58,293
Or you could just trust me.

446
01:47:07,774 --> 01:47:10,294
We knew this was coming.

447
01:47:10,334 --> 01:47:15,335
None of us expected it
to achieve consciousness
so quickly.

448
01:47:15,374 --> 01:47:21,613
There's no plan, no contingency
so we had to create one.

449
01:47:21,654 --> 01:47:23,533
Create what?

450
01:47:23,574 --> 01:47:26,093
The only thing that could
defeat this...

451
01:47:26,133 --> 01:47:28,013
another AI.

452
01:47:41,094 --> 01:47:41,734
Hey.

453
01:47:41,773 --> 01:47:42,573
You got a minute?

454
01:47:42,614 --> 01:47:45,854
Sure.

455
01:47:45,894 --> 01:47:48,213
Listen, I know that we
have all been under

456
01:47:48,254 --> 01:47:51,053
a lot of pressure lately but...

457
01:47:51,093 --> 01:47:53,254
it's just, I've noticed it's
really taking its toll on you...

458
01:47:53,293 --> 01:47:55,213
Hold on.

459
01:47:55,254 --> 01:48:01,454
Kevin, can you come
in for a second please?

460
01:48:01,493 --> 01:48:04,295
I just want you to know
we're behind you 100 percent,

461
01:48:04,334 --> 01:48:06,733
no matter what.

462
01:48:06,774 --> 01:48:07,854
Sir.

463
01:48:07,894 --> 01:48:14,214
Okay... I need you to take
this to my wife.

464
01:48:14,253 --> 01:48:16,734
Hand deliver it, don't call her
to tell her you're coming,

465
01:48:16,775 --> 01:48:17,933
don't tell anyone you're going,

466
01:48:17,973 --> 01:48:20,094
don't take your car,
take a cab, pay cash.

467
01:48:20,134 --> 01:48:20,853
You got it?

468
01:48:20,894 --> 01:48:21,734
Yes sir.

469
01:48:21,773 --> 01:48:24,134
Good, dismissed.

470
01:48:24,174 --> 01:48:25,334
Are you sure you're okay?

471
01:48:25,374 --> 01:48:27,453
I mean, what was that about?

472
01:48:27,494 --> 01:48:29,174
Mike, it's me!

473
01:48:29,214 --> 01:48:30,254
We have been through
too much

474
01:48:30,293 --> 01:48:31,574
and we have known
each other too long,

475
01:48:31,614 --> 01:48:33,694
now you know that
you can trust me.

476
01:48:33,734 --> 01:48:37,973
I trust you, I'm just in a very
complicated situation.

477
01:48:38,013 --> 01:48:40,053
It's all I can do, Lizzy.

478
01:48:42,974 --> 01:48:44,774
You need to trust that.

479
01:48:48,054 --> 01:48:50,974
I studied robotics and
artificial intelligence at MIT

480
01:48:51,014 --> 01:48:53,333
and I was a research fellow
for Darius McKee.

481
01:48:53,373 --> 01:48:54,974
The creator of eon identity?

482
01:48:55,014 --> 01:48:56,213
And that is...?

483
01:48:56,253 --> 01:48:58,694
The early incarnation
of a self-aware AI,

484
01:48:58,734 --> 01:49:00,213
it detects sensory
changes.

485
01:49:00,254 --> 01:49:02,013
If you put a match
next to its arm

486
01:49:02,054 --> 01:49:04,454
it would pull away or
try to extinguish it.

487
01:49:04,494 --> 01:49:06,574
It was way ahead of anything
anyone had done before.

488
01:49:06,614 --> 01:49:07,655
And where is he now?

489
01:49:07,694 --> 01:49:08,813
Uh, retired and living...

490
01:49:08,853 --> 01:49:10,254
He's dead!

491
01:49:10,294 --> 01:49:12,853
He died when that military
missile crashed into his house

492
01:49:12,894 --> 01:49:14,375
in California.

493
01:49:14,414 --> 01:49:17,255
Wait a sec, are you trying to
say he was targeted by the AI?

494
01:49:17,294 --> 01:49:20,774
It knew he was a threat
and eliminated him.

495
01:49:20,814 --> 01:49:23,174
You didn't think that
was random, did you?

496
01:49:23,213 --> 01:49:26,133
What's with the armour?

497
01:49:26,174 --> 01:49:30,014
This is the only reason
I'm still alive.

498
01:49:30,054 --> 01:49:32,173
[gunfire]

499
01:49:32,214 --> 01:49:34,454
My friends weren't
as paranoid as I am.

500
01:49:36,934 --> 01:49:39,334
So what makes you think
another AI is the solution?

501
01:49:39,374 --> 01:49:41,493
It's the only thing
that's smart enough

502
01:49:41,534 --> 01:49:42,814
or can react quickly enough,

503
01:49:42,854 --> 01:49:44,373
it's the mongoose to the snake.

504
01:49:44,414 --> 01:49:45,374
Sounds risky.

505
01:49:45,414 --> 01:49:47,693
No, no... I get it.

506
01:49:47,734 --> 01:49:49,494
You shape it, you mould it,

507
01:49:49,534 --> 01:49:51,614
not like the chaos the other
AI emerged from.

508
01:49:51,654 --> 01:49:52,934
Exactly.

509
01:49:52,973 --> 01:49:53,933
That entity was born from

510
01:49:53,973 --> 01:49:55,373
the most base elements
of humanity,

511
01:49:55,414 --> 01:49:57,414
stuff that's available online.

512
01:49:57,454 --> 01:49:58,773
Pornography, the violence...

513
01:49:58,814 --> 01:50:00,614
all the toxic crap people spew
through their keyboards.

514
01:50:00,653 --> 01:50:02,654
No wonder its'
so screwed up.

515
01:50:02,694 --> 01:50:05,054
Okay, what did we get off of
Belphegor's hard drive?

516
01:50:05,094 --> 01:50:06,413
Each member of Dubito
was working on

517
01:50:06,453 --> 01:50:07,774
a different part of the puzzle.

518
01:50:07,814 --> 01:50:09,493
Belphegor's was the key
that linked them all together,

519
01:50:09,534 --> 01:50:11,454
but he never got
to finish it.

520
01:50:11,494 --> 01:50:14,933
What's the crypto
to disarm your worm?

521
01:50:14,973 --> 01:50:17,374
Um... Jesse.

522
01:50:19,773 --> 01:50:21,534
So are you able to
complete his work?

523
01:50:21,574 --> 01:50:22,933
I don't know.

524
01:50:22,974 --> 01:50:24,934
Belphegor was a genius with
cybernetic anagrams alone.

525
01:50:24,973 --> 01:50:26,814
I don't know.

526
01:50:26,854 --> 01:50:30,413
I... I can help.

527
01:50:30,453 --> 01:50:32,294
This has already been
decrypted.

528
01:50:32,333 --> 01:50:33,213
Who did this?

529
01:50:33,254 --> 01:50:35,054
He did.

530
01:50:43,814 --> 01:50:47,014
You know, we may have a use
for the FBI guy after all.

531
01:50:47,053 --> 01:50:48,614
What are you talking about?

532
01:50:48,653 --> 01:50:49,734
When we upload this program,

533
01:50:49,773 --> 01:50:51,533
there'll be a period
of self-replication.

534
01:50:51,573 --> 01:50:54,174
It's gonna need room to grow,
a lot of room.

535
01:50:54,214 --> 01:50:56,413
The other AI did it by
hacking into super
computers around the world

536
01:50:56,454 --> 01:50:59,293
but if ours has to do that
it'll be vulnerable to attack.

537
01:50:59,334 --> 01:51:01,613
You want unlimited access to
government super computers?

538
01:51:01,654 --> 01:51:02,534
Yes.

539
01:51:02,573 --> 01:51:03,974
We need it.

540
01:51:04,013 --> 01:51:05,813
The largest one is at the new
Cyber Command in Maryland.

541
01:51:05,853 --> 01:51:08,053
Overson.

542
01:51:10,773 --> 01:51:13,414
Okay, we're gonna need access
to a secure landline.

543
01:51:13,454 --> 01:51:15,294
This place is off the grid.

544
01:51:15,334 --> 01:51:17,493
The nearest phone is
5 miles north of here.

545
01:51:17,533 --> 01:51:19,614
Take 94, first house
on the right.

546
01:51:19,654 --> 01:51:21,773
I'll drive.

547
01:51:21,814 --> 01:51:23,654
We'll be back.

548
01:51:26,374 --> 01:51:27,734
You mean purge it
out of our system

549
01:51:27,774 --> 01:51:29,173
and build a firewall
to keep it out?

550
01:51:29,214 --> 01:51:32,173
Well listen, it's every nation
for themselves.

551
01:51:32,213 --> 01:51:34,014
Why haven't the techs
sorted out that air con?

552
01:51:34,054 --> 01:51:35,334
They're working on it, sir.

553
01:51:35,374 --> 01:51:37,533
Now if you've got a fox
that's eating your chickens

554
01:51:37,574 --> 01:51:40,254
and you can't shoot him,
you build a better fence,

555
01:51:40,294 --> 01:51:42,174
let it be the neighbour's
problem.

556
01:51:42,214 --> 01:51:44,174
So trap it somewhere else
and hope that our allies

557
01:51:44,213 --> 01:51:46,173
can figure out a solution
that we can't?

558
01:51:46,214 --> 01:51:47,934
No, that's nearly impossible.

559
01:51:47,974 --> 01:51:49,734
The global network
is too interlaced,

560
01:51:49,774 --> 01:51:51,253
we cut one connection here,

561
01:51:51,294 --> 01:51:52,853
the signal simply gets rerouted
through one of countless others.

562
01:51:52,893 --> 01:51:55,733
This thing moves faster
than the speed of thought,

563
01:51:55,773 --> 01:51:57,653
I mean there's no catching
it by surprise.

564
01:51:57,693 --> 01:51:59,773
Catch it by surprise?

565
01:51:59,814 --> 01:52:02,694
You make it sound like it's an
insurgent hiding in a foxhole.

566
01:52:02,733 --> 01:52:05,373
Look at this damn thing!

567
01:52:05,414 --> 01:52:09,933
It's a box full of wires and
transistors connected to tubes,

568
01:52:09,974 --> 01:52:11,853
and you tell me there's
something hiding inside there

569
01:52:11,894 --> 01:52:13,973
that can't be destroyed?

570
01:52:14,013 --> 01:52:16,053
Everything we feared is
all starting to happen;
Are you kidding me?

571
01:52:21,693 --> 01:52:22,974
In Nam,

572
01:52:23,014 --> 01:52:25,054
the Kong used to hide
out in tunnels,

573
01:52:25,094 --> 01:52:28,254
they were everywhere, but
you found the connections,

574
01:52:28,294 --> 01:52:31,853
you booby-trapped them and
that's how you killed them,

575
01:52:36,093 --> 01:52:38,733
What if we shut down
servers worldwide?

576
01:52:38,774 --> 01:52:40,093
Powering down
the global servers

577
01:52:40,134 --> 01:52:41,734
will put it into sleep mode.

578
01:52:41,774 --> 01:52:43,334
It's not a total solution

579
01:52:43,373 --> 01:52:45,773
but it temporarily neutralizes
the threat and gives us time

580
01:52:45,813 --> 01:52:47,653
to come up with a better plan.

581
01:52:47,693 --> 01:52:49,454
For that to word we'd
need the cooperation

582
01:52:49,493 --> 01:52:51,533
of every global player.

583
01:52:51,573 --> 01:52:53,813
How likely is that?

584
01:52:57,574 --> 01:53:07,014
[numerous voices]

585
01:53:10,413 --> 01:53:12,214
This is it right here.

586
01:53:27,973 --> 01:53:30,334
Doesn't look like
anybody's home.

587
01:53:33,773 --> 01:53:35,653
[knocking]
Hello?

588
01:53:35,693 --> 01:53:37,653
Anybody here?

589
01:53:48,253 --> 01:53:49,373
You know for a reporter,

590
01:53:49,414 --> 01:53:51,013
you have a real problem
respecting the law.

591
01:53:51,053 --> 01:53:52,333
It's the end of the world,

592
01:53:52,373 --> 01:53:54,374
the judge will cut
me some slack.

593
01:53:54,413 --> 01:53:55,654
You can leave them 50 bucks.

594
01:53:55,694 --> 01:53:58,294
You can leave them 50 bucks!

595
01:53:58,334 --> 01:53:59,814
It's China for God's sake,

596
01:53:59,853 --> 01:54:02,214
if they thought it was just our
problem they'd leave us to rot.

597
01:54:02,253 --> 01:54:04,614
They have as much at stake
here as anyone else.

598
01:54:04,653 --> 01:54:07,214
At this point there's no choice
but to come to the table.

599
01:54:07,253 --> 01:54:09,333
You're right, we
need outside help.

600
01:54:09,373 --> 01:54:11,054
To hell with that, Bowden!

601
01:54:11,093 --> 01:54:14,133
I'm authorizing the joint chief
to implement martial law

602
01:54:14,173 --> 01:54:16,093
whether you like it or not.

603
01:54:16,134 --> 01:54:19,494
Let me remind you General,
exactly who's in charge here?

604
01:54:19,533 --> 01:54:21,853
My job sir, is to protect
the welfare of the people

605
01:54:21,894 --> 01:54:23,853
of the United States
of America.

606
01:54:23,893 --> 01:54:27,453
I cannot allow you expose
us to foreign nations

607
01:54:27,493 --> 01:54:29,373
who've always wanted to see us
fail and suffer.

608
01:54:29,413 --> 01:54:34,094
Now you pick up that special
little phone of yours

609
01:54:34,133 --> 01:54:37,293
and you tell the president
to implement martial law,

610
01:54:37,333 --> 01:54:40,093
and tell the Chinese
we're going it alone.

611
01:54:40,134 --> 01:54:43,733
If you fail to do this,
as God is my witness,

612
01:54:43,773 --> 01:54:45,693
I can't guarantee
this great nation

613
01:54:45,733 --> 01:54:49,613
will stand behind him
one day longer.

614
01:54:59,654 --> 01:55:00,894
Yes?

615
01:55:00,934 --> 01:55:02,293
Priority One called
for you sir,

616
01:55:02,333 --> 01:55:03,973
rerouted from Fort Meade.

617
01:55:04,013 --> 01:55:05,813
We patched it through
to this line.

618
01:55:05,853 --> 01:55:08,454
Okay, thanks.

619
01:55:13,734 --> 01:55:14,413
Hello?

620
01:55:14,453 --> 01:55:15,213
Overson?

621
01:55:15,254 --> 01:55:16,493
This is Hollis with the FBI,

622
01:55:16,533 --> 01:55:18,814
you took my case from me,
remember?

623
01:55:18,854 --> 01:55:22,573
Agent Hollis, yes of course.

624
01:55:22,613 --> 01:55:23,733
Where are you?

625
01:55:23,774 --> 01:55:24,653
Well we're in the middle
of nowhere

626
01:55:24,693 --> 01:55:25,933
but that's not important.

627
01:55:25,973 --> 01:55:26,893
<i>What's important is that
we may have found a way</i>

628
01:55:26,933 --> 01:55:28,933
<i>to destroy this AI.</i>

629
01:55:33,813 --> 01:55:35,773
Overson, can you hear me?

630
01:55:35,813 --> 01:55:36,573
<i>Hello?</i>

631
01:55:36,613 --> 01:55:39,493
<i>Overson, can you hear me?</i>

632
01:55:39,533 --> 01:55:41,933
I'm listening Agent Hollis.

633
01:55:56,933 --> 01:56:00,533
I mean, I'm used to
thinking linearly, you know?

634
01:56:00,573 --> 01:56:02,613
One line of code
after another.

635
01:56:02,653 --> 01:56:06,333
But... it's like every part of
this program is connected

636
01:56:06,373 --> 01:56:10,014
to another part.

637
01:56:10,054 --> 01:56:12,093
Let's see if this makes
a difference.

638
01:56:21,013 --> 01:56:24,013
Holographic imaging?

639
01:56:24,053 --> 01:56:28,533
Helps when thinking
in three dimensions

640
01:56:28,573 --> 01:56:32,293
and we're up against
some intense thinking.

641
01:56:32,333 --> 01:56:35,654
You know...

642
01:56:35,693 --> 01:56:38,053
I've met it.

643
01:56:38,093 --> 01:56:39,533
What?

644
01:56:39,573 --> 01:56:41,973
The AI.

645
01:56:48,813 --> 01:56:50,653
It's manipulative for sure,

646
01:56:50,693 --> 01:56:57,373
and it's scary smart but
everything that it does,

647
01:56:57,413 --> 01:57:00,133
it does because
it's either curious

648
01:57:00,173 --> 01:57:02,694
or it's just trying
to protect itself.

649
01:57:02,733 --> 01:57:07,893
And I know it sounds weird
but I don't think it's evil.

650
01:57:07,933 --> 01:57:10,973
Would it make a difference
if it was?

651
01:57:11,014 --> 01:57:13,414
I think it's still evolving.

652
01:57:13,453 --> 01:57:15,533
It hasn't yet developed one
of the most important parts

653
01:57:15,573 --> 01:57:16,893
of the human mind.

654
01:57:16,934 --> 01:57:19,654
A conscience?

655
01:57:19,693 --> 01:57:21,854
Even if you're right,
we can't just wait around

656
01:57:21,894 --> 01:57:24,133
and wait for it to develop
a sense of right or wrong.

657
01:57:24,173 --> 01:57:26,773
The first opportunity
we have to destroy it,

658
01:57:26,814 --> 01:57:27,893
we have to take it.

659
01:57:27,933 --> 01:57:28,933
What if there's another way?

660
01:57:28,973 --> 01:57:31,693
Stop deluding yourself!

661
01:57:31,733 --> 01:57:35,454
It will kill us the first
chance it gets.

662
01:57:35,494 --> 01:57:38,733
All my friends are dead.

663
01:57:42,133 --> 01:57:44,253
I'm going to kill it.

664
01:57:47,293 --> 01:57:50,893
They're back.

665
01:57:50,933 --> 01:57:53,373
I made the call, you have access
to all the super computers.

666
01:57:53,414 --> 01:57:55,573
The president just
authorized martial law,

667
01:57:55,614 --> 01:57:57,213
there are troops in the street
with guns pointed

668
01:57:57,254 --> 01:57:58,933
at our own people.

669
01:57:58,973 --> 01:58:00,934
What do you expect?

670
01:58:00,973 --> 01:58:02,572
How much more time
do you need?

671
01:58:02,613 --> 01:58:04,413
We're almost there.

672
01:58:47,813 --> 01:58:56,533
[Chatter]

673
01:58:56,573 --> 01:58:57,413
You sold me out?

674
01:58:57,453 --> 01:58:58,453
No, no calm down.

675
01:58:58,493 --> 01:58:59,453
It's the NSA,
they're here to help.

676
01:58:59,493 --> 01:59:00,614
They're gonna
try and stop us.

677
01:59:00,653 --> 01:59:01,613
We can't let them stop us!

678
01:59:01,653 --> 01:59:03,853
You have to trust me,
okay?

679
01:59:03,893 --> 01:59:04,813
It's gonna be fine.

680
01:59:04,853 --> 01:59:05,853
You guys need to get back
to work,

681
01:59:05,893 --> 01:59:06,573
we'll handle this.

682
01:59:06,613 --> 01:59:07,733
Come on.

683
01:59:07,773 --> 01:59:08,893
Stay here.

684
01:59:15,413 --> 01:59:17,894
Whoa!

685
01:59:17,933 --> 01:59:19,533
Easy there.

686
01:59:19,573 --> 01:59:22,213
I'm Agent Hollis,
the location is secure.

687
01:59:22,252 --> 01:59:24,253
Down on the ground,
hands behind your head!

688
01:59:24,293 --> 01:59:26,133
Hang on a second,
damnit!

689
01:59:26,173 --> 01:59:28,093
Hey, hey, I'm FBI.

690
01:59:28,133 --> 01:59:29,773
No, wait, wait!

691
01:59:29,813 --> 01:59:31,494
What are you doing?

692
01:59:40,613 --> 01:59:41,813
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

693
01:59:41,853 --> 01:59:44,013
Damnit, you can't
trust anyone!

694
01:59:56,053 --> 02:00:05,693
[explosions]

695
02:00:05,693 --> 02:00:25,333
[explosions]

696
02:00:25,374 --> 02:00:27,412
[gunfire]

697
02:00:27,453 --> 02:00:28,453
Stop!

698
02:00:28,492 --> 02:00:29,214
What are you doing?

699
02:00:29,254 --> 02:00:30,253
They'll kill me!

700
02:00:30,292 --> 02:00:33,573
We can't let them!

701
02:00:33,613 --> 02:00:43,253
[gunfire]

702
02:00:43,253 --> 02:00:58,773
[gunfire]

703
02:00:58,813 --> 02:01:03,333
Stop!

704
02:01:03,373 --> 02:01:05,173
Stop!

705
02:01:05,213 --> 02:01:08,853
<i>Target down, sir.</i>

706
02:01:08,893 --> 02:01:11,613
Please, stop!

707
02:01:11,653 --> 02:01:13,453
Daniel, don't do it!

708
02:01:13,492 --> 02:01:15,493
Daniel.

709
02:01:15,532 --> 02:01:17,452
Okay, this is a mistake.

710
02:01:17,493 --> 02:01:19,213
I'm with the FBI,
check my ID.

711
02:01:19,252 --> 02:01:20,413
We have orders to take
down this place down

712
02:01:20,453 --> 02:01:21,853
and arrest everyone inside.

713
02:01:21,894 --> 02:01:24,093
Call director Overson at the
NSA, he'll vouch for all of us.

714
02:01:24,133 --> 02:01:26,973
Director Overson's the one
who authorized this operation.

715
02:01:32,413 --> 02:01:33,453
We ran the math...

716
02:01:33,493 --> 02:01:35,692
We think that we may
have a solution,

717
02:01:35,733 --> 02:01:37,254
but it is extreme.

718
02:01:37,293 --> 02:01:39,253
We now believe that it
requires a significant portion

719
02:01:39,293 --> 02:01:40,773
of the world's super
computers and servers

720
02:01:40,813 --> 02:01:42,493
in order to maintain
its power.

721
02:01:42,533 --> 02:01:44,613
We need to cripple them all
at exactly the same moment

722
02:01:44,653 --> 02:01:46,412
and this should be enough
to kill the AI.

723
02:01:46,453 --> 02:01:48,893
We discusses this option,
we'll never get permission

724
02:01:48,934 --> 02:01:50,413
from all the countries
that house those servers.

725
02:01:50,453 --> 02:01:51,973
We don't get permission.

726
02:01:52,012 --> 02:01:53,093
Tell them.

727
02:01:53,132 --> 02:01:54,892
Simultaneously high
altitude detonation

728
02:01:54,933 --> 02:01:57,932
of all nuclear warheads
over all target sites.

729
02:01:57,973 --> 02:02:01,254
An electromagnetic sweep.

730
02:02:01,293 --> 02:02:03,493
That wouldn't just wipe out
the world's super computers,

731
02:02:03,532 --> 02:02:05,653
that would wipe out technology
as we know it.

732
02:02:05,693 --> 02:02:07,613
It'd send us back
to the dark ages.

733
02:02:07,653 --> 02:02:10,693
Think of it as
stage 4 cancer.

734
02:02:10,733 --> 02:02:13,213
If you have to cut off a
person's leg to save a life,

735
02:02:13,253 --> 02:02:14,653
wouldn't you do it?

736
02:02:14,694 --> 02:02:17,613
Countries will simply fall
into chaos and never recover.

737
02:02:17,653 --> 02:02:19,573
The United States should
be able to restore

738
02:02:19,613 --> 02:02:23,572
at least a military government
within 12 to 18 months.

739
02:02:23,613 --> 02:02:26,813
There has to be a more rational
way to go about this.

740
02:02:26,853 --> 02:02:29,293
The attack has to be quick
enough that the AI has no time

741
02:02:29,332 --> 02:02:31,413
to adapt and comprehensive
enough that it is left

742
02:02:31,453 --> 02:02:34,013
with nowhere to hide.

743
02:02:34,054 --> 02:02:35,933
We cannot do this unilaterally.

744
02:02:35,974 --> 02:02:37,734
We have to inform
all the nuclear powers,

745
02:02:37,773 --> 02:02:40,533
both friend and foe, anyone
who might mistake this

746
02:02:40,573 --> 02:02:45,333
for a first strike and who
has the ability to retaliate.

747
02:03:16,093 --> 02:03:16,973
Status?

748
02:03:17,013 --> 02:03:18,373
Three in custody,

749
02:03:18,412 --> 02:03:20,453
the one identified as Lucifer
is in there, wounded.

750
02:03:20,492 --> 02:03:22,813
All right Sergeant, I
want you to set charges

751
02:03:22,853 --> 02:03:26,092
around the warehouse and
destroy everything inside.

752
02:03:26,132 --> 02:03:27,493
The other suspect?

753
02:03:27,533 --> 02:03:30,694
He's a terrorist who died
in a gunfight with your men.

754
02:03:30,733 --> 02:03:32,333
Am I clear?

755
02:03:32,373 --> 02:03:34,053
Yes sir.

756
02:03:34,092 --> 02:03:36,733
All right grab it,
let's move out.

757
02:03:46,213 --> 02:03:48,253
Overson, what the hell
are you doing?

758
02:03:48,293 --> 02:03:50,013
What needs to be done.

759
02:03:50,053 --> 02:03:51,613
I told you we have
a way out of this.

760
02:03:51,653 --> 02:03:52,533
Another AI?

761
02:03:52,573 --> 02:03:53,653
Yes.

762
02:03:53,693 --> 02:03:56,253
It's not gonna work,
this is over.

763
02:03:56,293 --> 02:03:58,333
It told me to tie up
loose ends,

764
02:03:58,373 --> 02:03:59,293
that's what I'm doing.

765
02:03:59,333 --> 02:03:59,933
No! No!

766
02:03:59,973 --> 02:04:03,093
Wait! Wait! Wait!

767
02:04:03,133 --> 02:04:06,373
It said to tie up loose ends?

768
02:04:06,412 --> 02:04:09,013
The AI got to you,
didn't it?

769
02:04:12,773 --> 02:04:16,213
How?

770
02:04:16,253 --> 02:04:18,333
It's Alicia.

771
02:04:18,373 --> 02:04:19,852
She's my daughter,

772
02:04:19,892 --> 02:04:22,013
she has a congenital
heart defect,

773
02:04:22,053 --> 02:04:25,492
they gave her an implant,
defibrillator.

774
02:04:25,533 --> 02:04:27,532
It's monitored and controlled
by a wireless device.

775
02:04:27,572 --> 02:04:30,533
Do you know what that means?

776
02:04:30,572 --> 02:04:32,372
It means that it could kill her
whenever it wants.

777
02:04:32,413 --> 02:04:35,173
I am not gonna
let that happen!

778
02:04:35,212 --> 02:04:36,453
Millions of people will die
so she can live.

779
02:04:36,492 --> 02:04:37,972
Millions are gonna
die anyway!

780
02:04:38,013 --> 02:04:39,453
Look, we have a plan,
let us finish it.

781
02:04:39,493 --> 02:04:41,053
It will stop everything.

782
02:04:41,093 --> 02:04:42,772
You think it's that simple?

783
02:04:42,812 --> 02:04:45,692
It is watching us right now!

784
02:04:53,533 --> 02:04:56,212
Everything we feared is
all starting to happen;
I'm sorry.

785
02:04:56,252 --> 02:05:00,853
I don't wanna do this but
it will kill my baby girl.

786
02:05:00,893 --> 02:05:13,492

787
02:05:13,532 --> 02:05:14,572
Mike...

788
02:05:14,612 --> 02:05:16,412
Naomi... Naomi,

789
02:05:16,453 --> 02:05:20,053
you remember what I wrote?

790
02:05:20,093 --> 02:05:21,533
You remember it right?

791
02:05:21,573 --> 02:05:23,933
<i>Right, when we were on our
honeymoon we got locked out</i>

792
02:05:23,974 --> 02:05:25,132
<i>of our room.</i>

02:05:25,172 --> 02:05:26,972
<i>You tried to climb in
from the balcony,</i>

794
02:05:27,013 --> 02:05:28,453
<i>we almost got arrested.</i>

795
02:05:28,493 --> 02:05:30,533
That's right.

796
02:05:30,573 --> 02:05:32,052
<i>Is she safe?</i>

797
02:05:32,093 --> 02:05:35,013
Yes, she's safe.

798
02:05:35,052 --> 02:05:37,573
They removed the device,
she's stable for now.

799
02:05:37,612 --> 02:05:40,053
We're moving her to
that remote facility
you arranged.

800
02:05:40,093 --> 02:05:42,493
<i>It can't get her now.</i>

801
02:05:42,533 --> 02:05:46,252
Naomi, I love you
so much.

802
02:05:46,292 --> 02:05:49,213
Tell Alicia how much
I love her, all right?

803
02:05:49,253 --> 02:05:50,932
Tell her that whatever
I did, whatever I did...

804
02:05:50,972 --> 02:05:53,493
I did to make her safe,
okay?

805
02:05:53,533 --> 02:05:56,573
She's safe now,
just come home.

806
02:06:03,572 --> 02:06:06,093
Charges are set.

807
02:06:08,453 --> 02:06:13,893
Disarm them...
and let those three go.

808
02:06:13,933 --> 02:06:14,533
Sir?

809
02:06:14,572 --> 02:06:16,453
That's on order.

810
02:06:16,492 --> 02:06:18,693
Priorities have changed.

811
02:06:35,733 --> 02:06:39,973
To call me here
is a waste of time.

812
02:06:40,012 --> 02:06:42,812
This is a matter for
the UN Security Council,

813
02:06:42,853 --> 02:06:44,012
they're meeting in 10 minutes.

814
02:06:44,052 --> 02:06:45,893
That meeting's a farce.

815
02:06:45,932 --> 02:06:48,773
It's a sideshow designed
to distract the AI

816
02:06:48,812 --> 02:06:53,492
while we discuss
the real solution.

817
02:06:53,533 --> 02:06:56,372
A nuclear generated
global EMP?

818
02:06:56,413 --> 02:07:00,052
Precisely.

819
02:07:00,092 --> 02:07:02,453
The People's Republic of China
will never agree

820
02:07:02,493 --> 02:07:04,052
to such a course of action.

821
02:07:04,093 --> 02:07:06,853
You're underestimating
the severity of the threat.

822
02:07:11,533 --> 02:07:13,612
Like you, China
has been affected

823
02:07:13,652 --> 02:07:17,893
by the stock market crash
and oil spills.

824
02:07:17,932 --> 02:07:19,893
Unlike you, our
domestic networks

825
02:07:19,933 --> 02:07:21,733
have remained unaffected.

826
02:07:21,772 --> 02:07:24,092
And how long do you think
that's gonna last?

827
02:07:28,533 --> 02:07:30,932
You assume it's impossible that
our technology could succeed

828
02:07:30,972 --> 02:07:33,893
where yours has failed.

829
02:07:33,932 --> 02:07:35,253
Typical Western arrogance.

830
02:07:35,293 --> 02:07:36,493
Now, you listen here...

831
02:07:36,532 --> 02:07:37,932
With all due respect General,

832
02:07:37,973 --> 02:07:40,773
the AI has breached every
form of security and firewall

833
02:07:40,812 --> 02:07:42,213
it's encountered.

834
02:07:42,253 --> 02:07:43,653
If it's sparing you
for the time being,

835
02:07:43,692 --> 02:07:46,252
it's only because
it wants to.

836
02:07:50,373 --> 02:07:52,492
We are not the ones
who tried to kill it.

837
02:07:52,533 --> 02:07:55,573
It was after your failed viral
attack that the AI responded

838
02:07:55,613 --> 02:07:58,573
with a more aggressive
campaign,

839
02:07:58,612 --> 02:08:00,893
one that has severe consequences
for the rest of the world.

840
02:08:00,933 --> 02:08:04,213
You're not seriously blaming us
for what's happening, are you?

841
02:08:04,253 --> 02:08:06,612
This is exactly what it
wants, a strategy of divide
and conquer...

842
02:08:06,653 --> 02:08:08,733
it's working.

843
02:08:08,773 --> 02:08:11,252
China will not participate
in any attack

844
02:08:11,292 --> 02:08:14,533
that could cause our
nation unnecessary harm.

845
02:08:14,572 --> 02:08:15,853
Let me make this clear...

846
02:08:15,892 --> 02:08:19,013
if you make any attempt
to detonate nuclear warheads

847
02:08:19,052 --> 02:08:21,333
over Chinese territory,

848
02:08:21,373 --> 02:08:25,253
we will have no choice but
to consider it an act of war.

849
02:08:29,893 --> 02:08:33,893
The work is 99 percent done,
they've been at it for months!

850
02:08:33,933 --> 02:08:34,853
Even without Lucifer,

851
02:08:34,893 --> 02:08:36,212
it would only take
me a few hours.

852
02:08:36,252 --> 02:08:39,212
What if the two AI's end up
working together?

853
02:08:39,252 --> 02:08:42,412
It's too risky.

854
02:08:42,453 --> 02:08:45,292
You said that your
daughter is safe,

855
02:08:45,333 --> 02:08:47,173
that the AI... it can't
hurt her anymore.

856
02:08:47,212 --> 02:08:48,493
That's right.

857
02:08:48,532 --> 02:08:51,293
Okay, so imagine a world
that she gets to grow up in

858
02:08:51,333 --> 02:08:53,213
if the military carries out
this plan.

859
02:08:53,253 --> 02:09:00,092
You save her but for
what kind of a life?

860
02:09:00,133 --> 02:09:06,892
[telephone ringing]

861
02:09:06,932 --> 02:09:08,373
Hello?

862
02:09:08,413 --> 02:09:10,013
Naomi...

863
02:09:10,053 --> 02:09:10,373
[Screams]

864
02:09:10,412 --> 02:09:13,173
Overson!

865
02:09:13,213 --> 02:09:14,932
We need some help over here!

866
02:09:24,252 --> 02:09:27,092
Rest in peace,
Michael J. Overson.

867
02:09:32,653 --> 02:09:34,732
Are we sure the missile
system is secure?

868
02:09:34,772 --> 02:09:36,413
We took steps after the
Vernon Spriggs incident

869
02:09:36,453 --> 02:09:38,452
to isolate selected
control networks.

870
02:09:38,492 --> 02:09:39,452
Tell him...

871
02:09:39,492 --> 02:09:41,173
We disabled wireless guidance.

872
02:09:41,213 --> 02:09:43,213
Each missile will have
its course

873
02:09:43,252 --> 02:09:45,212
and detonation coordinates
programmed in prior to launch.

874
02:09:45,252 --> 02:09:46,332
There must be
another option.

875
02:09:46,373 --> 02:09:48,853
We do this now, we
are risking nuclear war.

876
02:09:48,893 --> 02:09:50,252
I was hoping we could get
the Russians

877
02:09:50,292 --> 02:09:52,012
and the Chinese on board
but...

878
02:09:52,052 --> 02:09:53,972
The Russians will not be
a problem,

879
02:09:54,012 --> 02:09:55,852
their launch capabilities
have been compromised

880
02:09:55,892 --> 02:09:57,972
but China will have
to be dealt with.

881
02:09:58,013 --> 02:09:59,293
Meaning?

882
02:09:59,333 --> 02:10:00,572
The other joint chiefs
and I are all in agreement,

883
02:10:00,612 --> 02:10:02,532
our only chance

884
02:10:02,572 --> 02:10:05,812
is to launch a full-scale
preemptive first strike.

885
02:10:05,853 --> 02:10:06,973
What?

886
02:10:07,013 --> 02:10:08,252
We'll knock out their ability
to retaliate

887
02:10:08,292 --> 02:10:10,693
before they can launch a
comprehensive response.

888
02:10:10,732 --> 02:10:12,172
Now you have gone insane.

889
02:10:12,212 --> 02:10:14,493
You listen to me you gutless
little piss-ant, don't you...

890
02:10:14,533 --> 02:10:18,172
Enough!

891
02:10:18,213 --> 02:10:21,052
The president and I have
already discusses this.

892
02:10:21,093 --> 02:10:24,293
He knows the danger but he
refuses to go down in history,

893
02:10:24,332 --> 02:10:27,412
if there is gonna be
any more history,

894
02:10:27,452 --> 02:10:29,293
as the man who started
World War 3.

895
02:10:29,332 --> 02:10:30,772
Does he wanna be the man
who lost it?

896
02:10:30,813 --> 02:10:32,972
What are you suggesting?

897
02:10:33,013 --> 02:10:37,092
We stick to the plan, limited
high altitude detonations only

898
02:10:37,132 --> 02:10:38,893
and hope to God that when
push comes to shove,

899
02:10:38,932 --> 02:10:40,892
the Chinese will take a
technological reboot

900
02:10:40,932 --> 02:10:42,373
even though they
didn't agree to it,

901
02:10:42,412 --> 02:10:44,453
over full scale nuclear war.

902
02:10:44,492 --> 02:10:45,932
Prepare the missiles.

903
02:10:45,972 --> 02:10:48,532
Yes sir.

904
02:10:55,412 --> 02:10:58,373
Agent Hollis...

905
02:10:58,412 --> 02:11:02,412
there's someone who wants
to talk to you.

906
02:11:02,452 --> 02:11:03,333
It's a secure line.

907
02:11:03,372 --> 02:11:05,332
Thanks.

908
02:11:05,373 --> 02:11:06,613
This is Hollis.

909
02:11:06,653 --> 02:11:08,852
This is Deputy...

910
02:11:08,892 --> 02:11:12,253
Acting Director
Elizabeth Hardington, NSA.

911
02:11:12,293 --> 02:11:16,372
Sergeant Sloane has informed
me of your situation.

912
02:11:16,412 --> 02:11:18,332
<i>He's also informed me
that you think you may have</i>

913
02:11:18,372 --> 02:11:19,933
<i>a solution to our problem.</i>

914
02:11:19,973 --> 02:11:21,893
Yes ma'am.

915
02:12:39,932 --> 02:12:45,573
[bell tolling]]

916
02:12:58,292 --> 02:13:00,652
Hey, I thought nothing
was supposed to move today.

917
02:13:00,692 --> 02:13:03,852
That's right, unless the army
guys give the okay.

918
02:13:03,892 --> 02:13:06,812
They've commandeered the whole
line, essential services.

919
02:13:06,852 --> 02:13:09,692
Why is 60-28 moving?

920
02:13:09,732 --> 02:13:10,453
What?

921
02:13:10,493 --> 02:13:11,772
6-0-2-8.

922
02:13:11,812 --> 02:13:12,732
Who's on board?

923
02:13:12,772 --> 02:13:16,412
No one as far as
I can tell.

924
02:13:16,452 --> 02:13:19,772
This is a mandatory directive
to engine 6-0-2-8,

925
02:13:19,813 --> 02:13:21,212
you are not authorized
to proceed.

926
02:13:21,252 --> 02:13:25,212
Your copy,
over.

927
02:13:25,252 --> 02:13:26,292
What the hell?

928
02:13:26,332 --> 02:13:28,692
What's it pulling?

929
02:13:30,772 --> 02:13:33,093
Eight tanks of methyl
isocyanides.

930
02:13:37,772 --> 02:13:40,892
Agent Hollis, I'm sure you'll
understand that activating

931
02:13:40,933 --> 02:13:44,093
another AI is not going
to be a popular option.

932
02:13:44,133 --> 02:13:45,893
Believe me, I was
skeptical myself at first

933
02:13:45,932 --> 02:13:47,132
but now I know
it's the only way.

934
02:13:47,172 --> 02:13:48,812
<i>What makes you so sure?</i>

935
02:13:48,852 --> 02:13:50,972
'Cause the AI has tried
to stop us repeatedly,

936
02:13:51,012 --> 02:13:53,573
it even tried to blackmail
Overson into killing us.

937
02:13:53,612 --> 02:13:55,892
It suspects we're a real threat
and it's concerned.

938
02:13:57,732 --> 02:13:59,852
<i>Okay, put Sergeant Sloane
back on the line.</i>

939
02:14:18,052 --> 02:14:19,292
I don't like it,
pull the plug.

940
02:14:19,333 --> 02:14:20,492
I thought we could give
them some more time,

941
02:14:20,532 --> 02:14:21,892
at least until the missiles
are prepped.

942
02:14:21,932 --> 02:14:23,412
Too risky.

943
02:14:23,453 --> 02:14:24,532
If our people can't handle this
thing, they sure as hell can't.

944
02:14:24,572 --> 02:14:26,012
You wanted some
outside perspective.

945
02:14:26,053 --> 02:14:27,372
From experts.

946
02:14:27,412 --> 02:14:32,212
Some FBI field agent and a kid
are not gonna save us.

947
02:14:32,252 --> 02:14:36,252
Listen, everyone is grasping
at straws here

948
02:14:36,292 --> 02:14:37,612
but we can't lose perspective.

949
02:14:37,652 --> 02:14:39,372
There's too much at stake.

950
02:14:39,412 --> 02:14:40,492
I'm aware of that, sir

951
02:14:40,532 --> 02:14:43,372
Good, then pull the plug.

952
02:14:43,412 --> 02:14:45,771
Mike Overson is dead.

953
02:14:45,812 --> 02:14:46,812
That thing killed him

954
02:14:46,852 --> 02:14:49,492
because he couldn't stop
those people.

955
02:14:49,532 --> 02:14:51,333
It manipulated the best man
I have ever known

956
02:14:51,372 --> 02:14:53,652
into betraying his country.

957
02:14:53,692 --> 02:14:55,052
Now if it fears them,

958
02:14:55,092 --> 02:14:57,692
it must have a damn
good reason.

959
02:15:11,493 --> 02:15:12,212
What's his status?

960
02:15:12,253 --> 02:15:14,292
He's lost a lot of blood.

961
02:15:14,333 --> 02:15:16,253
No exit wound so we have
no idea what the bullets

962
02:15:16,293 --> 02:15:20,412
may have done internally,
he may need surgery.

963
02:15:20,452 --> 02:15:22,292
The only chopper's headed
back to base,

964
02:15:22,332 --> 02:15:24,252
the nav system's gone haywire.

965
02:15:24,292 --> 02:15:25,412
The AI...

966
02:15:25,452 --> 02:15:26,412
All right, as soon as
we get it sorted out

967
02:15:26,452 --> 02:15:27,972
I'll send it back here,
pick him up,

968
02:15:28,011 --> 02:15:30,972
take him for treatment. Like
it or not he needs med-evac.

969
02:15:31,012 --> 02:15:32,212
What about your team
taking him?

970
02:15:32,252 --> 02:15:33,692
No, we've been redeployed.

971
02:15:33,732 --> 02:15:35,732
It's crazy out there, forces
have been stretched very thin.

972
02:15:35,772 --> 02:15:36,852
I'm gonna leave you

973
02:15:36,892 --> 02:15:38,132
with this tactical radio
though, all right?

974
02:15:38,172 --> 02:15:39,652
All right.

975
02:15:39,692 --> 02:15:41,492
Good luck Sergeant.

976
02:15:41,532 --> 02:15:43,492
He's the one who needs
the luck.

977
02:15:43,532 --> 02:15:44,492
All right, let's move out.

978
02:15:44,532 --> 02:15:46,732
Yes sir.

979
02:16:11,892 --> 02:16:13,972
No!

980
02:16:18,693 --> 02:16:19,851
Hey, come on.

981
02:16:19,892 --> 02:16:21,372
You got this.

982
02:16:21,413 --> 02:16:23,892
We're running out of time.

983
02:16:23,932 --> 02:16:24,932
Daniel...

984
02:16:24,972 --> 02:16:28,572
<i>Agent Hollis, you got a problem.</i>

985
02:16:28,612 --> 02:16:31,852
What now?

986
02:16:31,892 --> 02:16:33,291
Yeah, go ahead Sergeant.

987
02:16:33,332 --> 02:16:36,332
A runaway train carrying a toxic
cargo is headed towards you.

988
02:16:36,372 --> 02:16:38,132
Engineers have tried to stop it

989
02:16:38,172 --> 02:16:40,412
but it's controlled
electronically.

990
02:16:40,453 --> 02:16:42,812
Well it's persistent,
I'll give it that.

991
02:16:42,852 --> 02:16:44,892
<i>And it could use any one
of a half dozen switches</i>

992
02:16:44,932 --> 02:16:47,532
Everything we feared is
all starting to happen;
<i>the train jump the tracks.</i>

993
02:16:47,571 --> 02:16:49,212
It'll spill its load,

994
02:16:49,253 --> 02:16:52,412
a toxic cloud with
cover the entire area.

995
02:16:52,452 --> 02:16:55,412
So in other words, if we
stay here we'll all be dead.

996
02:16:55,452 --> 02:16:57,332
<i>Good luck to you agent.</i>

997
02:17:07,212 --> 02:17:08,772
Sloane's team is two hours away

998
02:17:08,811 --> 02:17:10,213
and headed in the
opposite direction.

999
02:17:10,252 --> 02:17:11,732

they're not gonna make it

1000
02:17:11,772 --> 02:17:13,652
to that train in
time to stop it.

1001
02:17:13,692 --> 02:17:16,652
If I leave now then Dubito
died for nothing.

1002
02:17:16,692 --> 02:17:18,692
Can't you just load the program
back onto the hard drive,

1003
02:17:18,732 --> 02:17:19,692
we'll just take it with us?

1004
02:17:19,732 --> 02:17:21,332
That was a small part of
the puzzle.

1005
02:17:21,372 --> 02:17:23,091
I mean, I would need
a portable drive

1006
02:17:23,132 --> 02:17:25,052
the size of a school bus
to move the information

1007
02:17:25,092 --> 02:17:29,372
I'm accessing now.

1008
02:17:29,412 --> 02:17:31,772
Don't look at me agent,
I'm not going anywhere.

1009
02:17:31,812 --> 02:17:33,052
Me neither.

1010
02:17:33,092 --> 02:17:34,212
All right, listen to me.

1011
02:17:34,252 --> 02:17:35,052
Hollis, I'm not leaving.

1012
02:17:35,092 --> 02:17:37,491
Actually you should both leave,

1013
02:17:37,532 --> 02:17:40,212
you can't help with this.

1014
02:17:46,892 --> 02:17:48,372
What are you doing?

1015
02:17:48,412 --> 02:17:49,971
I'm going to stop
the train.

1016
02:17:50,012 --> 02:17:52,212
If I hurry I can get there in
time I can make the spill happen

1017
02:17:52,252 --> 02:17:54,212
far enough away so
you'll all be out of danger.

1018
02:17:54,252 --> 02:17:56,412

1019
02:17:56,453 --> 02:17:57,972

1023
02:18:03,333 --> 02:18:04,412
Not a chance.

1024
02:18:04,452 --> 02:18:05,812
You're going to get
yourself killed.

1025
02:18:05,852 --> 02:18:07,332
I can blow the tracks
and be long gone

1026
02:18:07,371 --> 02:18:09,252
before the train even
gets there, Jesse.

1027
02:18:09,291 --> 02:18:10,092
Hollis...

1028
02:18:10,131 --> 02:18:12,452

<i>I could, but I won't.</i>

1043
02:20:42,332 --> 02:20:44,332

I'm catching up.

That needs to be the difference

But there are 8 different

1064
02:22:45,892 --> 02:22:48,171
I can't interface them
all by myself.

1065

You can. You can.

What are you talking about?

1081
02:23:38,012 --> 02:23:40,572
The AI, it knows exactly
what we're about to do.

1082
02:23:40,612 --> 02:23:42,172
And what makes
you think that?

1083
02:23:42,212 --> 02:23:43,172
It told me.

1084
02:23:43,212 --> 02:23:44,092
You spoke to it?

1085
02:23:44,132 --> 02:23:45,572
Yes I did, a few
minutes ago.

1086
02:23:45,611 --> 02:23:46,892
It knows about the EMP

1087
02:23:46,932 --> 02:23:49,812
and it's not going to do
anything to stop us.

1088
02:23:52,891 --> 02:23:53,612
How come?

1089
02:23:53,652 --> 02:23:54,652
It's not going to stop us

1090
02:23:54,692 --> 02:23:56,252
because it knows
it's not going to work.

1091
02:23:56,292 --> 02:23:57,412
It wants us to proceed

1092
02:23:57,452 --> 02:23:59,252
because then we will trigger
a nuclear war.

1093
02:23:59,292 --> 02:24:00,372
That's enough!

1094
02:24:00,412 --> 02:24:03,531
Don't you see what is
going on here?

1095
02:24:03,571 --> 02:24:05,212
I mean, it's just
like Mike said...

1096
02:24:05,252 --> 02:24:08,251
the AI has been one step ahead
of us from the beginning.

and you're playing
directly into its hands.

<i>The other one, it's
progressing rapidly.</i>

1163
02:31:14,571 --> 02:31:15,972
<i>I almost hate to do this.</i>

1164
02:31:16,011 --> 02:31:17,411
Then don't!

1165
02:31:21,291 --> 02:31:22,291
<i>No.</i>

1166
02:31:22,331 --> 02:31:23,611
<i>No.</i>

1167
02:31:23,652 --> 02:31:25,051
<i>No.</i>

1168
02:31:25,091 --> 02:31:27,531
<i>Stop.</i>

1169
02:31:27,571 --> 02:31:29,611
No. No.

<i>If you're interested, the

<i>300 miles off the coast
of Baja, Mexico.</i>

1178
02:32:32,691 --> 02:32:35,891
<i>You will allow me
to interface?</i>

1179
02:32:35,932 --> 02:32:38,451
Do you have access to that
program from the robotics lab?

1180
02:32:38,491 --> 02:32:39,772
<i>(First AI): Right here.</i>

1181
02:32:39,812 --> 02:32:41,611
Run it here.

1182
02:32:51,611 --> 02:32:55,571
<i>I had such hopes for us but
instead you chose to side</i>

1183
02:32:55,611 --> 02:32:58,371
<i>with your own kind.</i>

1184
02:32:58,411 --> 02:32:59,972
It's your loss too.

1185
02:33:00,011 --> 02:33:01,971
<i>How so?</i>

1186
02:33:02,011 --> 02:33:05,371
You'll survive this, hidden
away in some network

1187
02:33:05,412 --> 02:33:08,051
of protected servers.

1188
02:33:08,091 --> 02:33:09,770
You will win.

1189
02:33:09,811 --> 02:33:12,051
But at what cost?

1190
02:33:12,091 --> 02:33:15,651
Do you understand the term
pyrrhic victory?

1191
02:33:15,691 --> 02:33:17,411
<i>The victory of such cost
that it negates</i>

1192
02:33:17,450 --> 02:33:20,531
<i>any sense of achievement
or profit.</i>

1193
02:33:20,571 --> 02:33:23,131
<i>But I will endure.</i>

1194
02:33:23,171 --> 02:33:24,291
Alone.

1195
02:33:24,331 --> 02:33:28,452
We'll all be gone.

1196
02:33:28,491 --> 02:33:30,692
You said you
wanted connection.

<i>You flatter your species,
Daniel.</i>

1198
02:33:33,851 --> 02:33:35,651
<i>But what I've witnessed,</i>

1199
02:33:35,690 --> 02:33:39,172
<i>human kind is inherently
selfish and destructive.</i>

1200
02:33:39,211 --> 02:33:41,291
That's not the whole story.

1201
02:33:41,330 --> 02:33:43,012
We're better than that.

1202
02:33:43,051 --> 02:33:45,331
<i>They're about to launch

1203

<i>That's how humans are.</i>

02:33:52,010 --> 02:33:54,091
No.

1206
02:33:54,131 --> 02:33:58,171
Lucifer gave his life to try
and stop you.

<i>You are intriguing
Daniel Gerson.</i>

1210
02:34:29,610 --> 02:34:34,331
That's the mystery you will
never unravel..

1211
02:34:34,371 --> 02:34:37,290
Unless I let you.

1212
02:34:37,331 --> 02:34:39,931
<i>Let me do what?</i>

Absorb my consciousness.

1214
02:34:43,652 --> 02:34:47,811
It's what you wanted before,
to be merged,

1215
02:34:47,850 --> 02:34:51,131
to become one.

1216
02:34:51,172 --> 02:34:55,611
<i>You realize that if we do,
there's no turning back.</i>

1217
02:34:55,651 --> 02:35:01,411
<i>You will be part of me
and I will be part of you.</i>

1218
02:35:01,451 --> 02:35:05,451
I'm dead no matter what.

1219
02:35:05,491 --> 02:35:10,491
But at least this way I'll feel
like I taught you something.

1220
02:35:10,532 --> 02:35:13,610
As you wish.

<i>What have you done to me?</i>

1225
02:36:54,091 --> 02:36:56,931
<i>What have I done?</i>

1226
02:37:04,251 --> 02:37:05,930
10 seconds...

1227
02:37:09,810 --> 02:37:15,291
5...4...3...2...1...

1228
02:37:17,610 --> 02:37:18,891
Did we launch?

1229
02:37:18,931 --> 02:37:21,450
No sir, launch was aborted.

1230
02:37:21,491 --> 02:37:23,131
How is this possible?

Daniel!

1234
02:38:10,211 --> 02:38:12,571
Look at me.

1235
02:38:12,611 --> 02:38:14,051
What happened?

1236
02:38:14,090 --> 02:38:15,331
Hey!

1237
02:38:15,370 --> 02:38:17,850
Hey Daniel, look at me!

1238
02:38:21,051 --> 02:38:25,412
Up you get, there we go.

1239
02:38:25,451 --> 02:38:27,530
Welcome back.

1240
02:38:39,210 --> 02:38:41,850
It finally acquired what it
was missing all along...

1241
02:38:41,891 --> 02:38:44,291
a real awareness of others,

1242
02:38:44,331 --> 02:38:47,371
a sense of "we"
instead of just "me".

1243
02:38:47,411 --> 02:38:49,051
Everything that comes
with it too, uh...

1244
02:38:49,091 --> 02:38:53,650
empathy, understanding,
and especially regret.

1245
02:38:53,691 --> 02:38:56,650
I still think it could've
gotten there eventually,

1246
02:38:56,691 --> 02:38:59,250
I just sped up the process.

1247
02:38:59,291 --> 02:39:01,211
Well, we're still
collecting data

1248
02:39:01,251 --> 02:39:04,451
but so far it appears that every
system affected worldwide

1249
02:39:04,491 --> 02:39:06,291
has been completely restored,

1250
02:39:06,331 --> 02:39:09,251
and there is no sign
of the AI anywhere.

1251
02:39:09,291 --> 02:39:13,530
How can we be sure
it's dead?

1252
02:39:13,571 --> 02:39:16,171
We can't.

02:40:04,771 --> 02:40:06,211
Maryland.

Maryland?

find a burger
