Thank you for your patience.
Your call :ls :Important to us.

8
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,881
We will be with you shorty

9
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:24,130
Mrs.
Greenslade, thank you fur waiting

10
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,711
I've consulted with my manager-

11
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,468
Now if you'll just stay on the
phone for a moment and talk to me.

12
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,512
Just talk to me.
Of course.

13
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:35,893
I'm not even clear- I mean, I don't actually
understand what it is I'm trying to order.

14
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:38,941
Is wireless the same as Wi-Fi?

15
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:42,611
And what do either of them
have to do with broadband?

16
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:45,690
Mrs. Greenslade, since the
account is not in your name,

17
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,740
before we can make
any changes,

18
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,535
we need to verify details
with the account holder.

19
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,239
Can I I please speak
to the account holder?

20
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:54,494
What?

21
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:57,247
I'm asking if l can talk
to the account holder:

22
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,294
Before we can make
any changes-

23
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,167
You can't talk to him, no.

24
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,791
He's dead.

25
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,423
He died of a heart attack.

26
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,092
There's only me.

27
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:11,890
Mrs. Greenslade, since the
account is not in your name-

28
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:16,095
Lord Justice Walton requests
the pleasure of our company.

29
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:19,899
- Had you forgotten?
- I hate retirement parties.

30
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,442
Crap cheese, crap wine.

31
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,440
Endless speeches.

32
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,396
Why do people do that?

33
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,156
Nobody- Nobody ever said about
a retirement party, you know,

34
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,781
Well, this is great.

35
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,738
I can't wait to have
one of my own.

36
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,368
it'll be yours one day.

37
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,371
One day very soon.

38
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,665
You've been saying that for years.

39
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:44,715
It was often said of Stancombe
that his bark was worse than his bite.

40
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,383
But as the recipient of both,

41
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:51,259
I can testify to the fact that
neither actually required surgery.

42
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:56,052
His relationship with
all his pupils...

43
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,057
was founded on respect.

44
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:02,892
We respected him, and he respected that.

45
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:06,899
Indeed, to this day,
I recall his response."

46
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,652
to the unwelcome news
that I would trans-

47
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,696
...praeciptium a tergo lupi.
[Echoing]

48
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,617
This is the day.

49
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:21,785
Graham?

50
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,499
This is the day.

51
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,724
And there's an unlimited range
of leisure opportunities...

52
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,767
just a stone's throw away.

53
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:42,223
So, as I say, what you're looking at
here is very competitively priced.

54
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,558
You won't see better
for your Grey Pound.

55
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,314
Another little feature-

56
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,896
not necessarily right now,
give it a few years-

57
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,949
rails on the wall
to help you get around.

58
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,947
And over here, a panic button.

59
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:58,656
In case of a sudden fall, brings
the warden running.

60
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,663
What if we fell
somewhere else?

61
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,415
Sorry?

62
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,791
It's just we might not manage
to plan our sudden fall...

63
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,382
in the exact corner where the button is.
Yeah, but-

64
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,712
And would it be possible to have the rail
going through the middle of the room-

65
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,965
Darling. to help us get
across, as well as around.

66
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,933
Um, c-c-could we have a moment, please?
Thank you. Yeah.

67
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,932
Thank you so much.

68
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,688
Darling-

69
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:27,610
Thirty years in the civil service,
and this is all we can afford.

70
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,857
W-W-Would it help
if I apologize again?

71
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:30,983
No.

72
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,033
But try it anyway.

73
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:39,158
Could Dr. Mackenzie please
make bra way to Theater 7.

74
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,331
Dr. Mackenzie to Theater 7.

75
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,785
Young lady, I want a cup of tea.
And I want it now.

76
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,586
The trolley
will be along shortly.

77
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,540
How hard do you have to fall
to get proper attention?

78
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,091
I've been lying here for hours.

79
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,918
Not a single doctor
has come to see me.

80
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,470
Now that's not quite true,
is it, Mrs. Donnelly?

81
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,845
A doctor did try and examine
you, and you sent him away.

82
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:03,054
What, that one? He can wash all he likes.
That color's not coming out.

83
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,022
I want an English doctor.

84
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,065
Oh, an English doctor.

85
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,894
Why didn't you say so?
I'll get one right away.

86
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,445
Thank you.

87
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:20,074
Mrs. Donnelly,
this is Dr. Ghujarapartidar.

88
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,660
Notes, please.

89
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,337
J Now here we go with the
flow of the girls you know J

90
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,631
J The ones seen in Argentina
and Mexico JJ

91
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:35,753
And after that, I worked as a
systems analyst for a few years,

92
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,635
but I just found it so dull.

93
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:43,264
What I really wanted was to do
something more creative that matched-

94
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,854
Um, I'm sorry.

95
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:50,355
Um, on the form, they asked
for our age bracket."

96
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,527
and the age
we wanted to meet.

97
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,401
And in both cases,
I ticked 25 to 39."

98
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,323
That's right. So did I.

99
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,868
Anyway, don't stop. Uh-
Something more creative.

100
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,033
How old are you?
Early 40s.

101
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:05,616
And, you know, my interests
are travel, theater-

102
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,997
Do you mean you were born
in the early '40s?

103
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,080
Judy, I know what you're asking.

104
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,414
It's Judith.

105
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,591
Judith. Trust me.

106
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,048
I've still got it.

107
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,724
Just can't ind anyone
that wants it.

108
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,472
Hi. I'm Norman.

109
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:32,355
This is crazy. You're crazy.
You can't just up and leave like this.

110
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:35,358
And yet, if you watch me, that's
exactly what you'll see happen.

111
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,025
What's going on?
Your mother's lost it.

112
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,403
- My mother never had it.
- You talk to her.

113
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,822
She doesn't listen to me.
Nobody listens to you.

114
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,700
I still don't understand
what's going on.

115
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,281
I just asked her to babysit,
and now she says she's leaving.

116
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,784
But you love babysitting.
I loved it last night.

117
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,744
We had pizza
and stayed up late.

118
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,751
- And the night before?
- We had Chinese and stayed up late.

119
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,925
If you don't go,
tonight we could do a curry.

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,300
It's tempting, darlings,
but you know I have to leave.

121
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,504
We know.

122
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,762
Being here is stopping her
finding a husband.

123
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,967
Another one?

124
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,561
Bye, Granny.
Bye, Granny.

125
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,105
Don't let the buggers
get you down.

126
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,399
How many husbands
have you had anyway?

127
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,943
- Including my own?
- Mother.

128
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,486
Mother.

129
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,946
Mother!

130
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,274
Thank you, yes.

131
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,657
Right. Name the place, darlin'.
Where you going?

132
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,540
I've absolutely no idea.

133
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,375
There's no other way.
There just isn't.

134
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,382
Harold told us this
three months ago.

135
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,459
And I'm afraid
matters have only got worse.

136
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,294
We can't wait any longer.

137
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:45,975
We need to put this flat on the market and
at least start paying off Dad's debts.

138
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:47,642
I've talked it through
with Polly and the boys.

139
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,140
Of course, we all agreed.
Ma will come and live with us.

140
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,519
I think that's best, Evelyn.

141
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,439
And it's what Hugh
would have wanted.

142
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,948
Good. Well, that's settled.
End of discussion.

143
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,659
Oh! That's just what your
father used to say- Ma.

144
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,782
When there'd never been
any discussion at all.

145
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,488
I want to look after
things for you.

146
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:12,246
What, like he did for 40 years?
Look how that turned out.

147
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:18,382
How on earth do we know
what Hugh would have wanted?

148
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,959
And would he have seen it
to tell us anyway?

149
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,800
Obviously,
the flat's got to be sold.

150
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:30,059
And you're very kind,
and dear Polly.

151
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,388
But I shan't be
coming to live with you.

152
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,766
You need a new hip,
Mrs. Donnelly.

153
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,726
It's not a difficult operation.

154
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,063
That's easy for you to say.
You're not having it.

155
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,524
Regardless.
You do need a new hip.

156
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,450
- I'm not gettin' it from you.
- Not me personally, no.

157
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,621
- No, none of your lot.
- I see.

158
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,198
When do I have the operation?

159
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,875
I'm afraid you'll be on the waiting
list for at least six months.

160
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,954
At my age,
I can't plan that far ahead.

161
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,460
I don't even buy green bananas.

162
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,759
There is another way.

163
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,383
Our hospital trust is funding
a pilot scheme...

164
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:08,261
that will enable us to outsource
you to another hospital."

165
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,183
where they can perform the
procedure almost immediately...

166
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,977
and at a fraction of the cost.

167
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,475
Is it local?

168
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:19,271
They cover the
cost of the flight out apparently.

169
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,569
When did you get a computer?

170
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,772
How far along
is the progress bar?

171
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,992
That thing at the top.
It tells you- I know what it is, Ma.

172
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,865
What are you
showing me anyway?

173
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:33,832
Come and spend
your autumn years in an Indian palace...

174
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:38,083
with the sophistication
of an English country manor.

175
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:42,257
Tucked away on the outskirts of Jaipur, and
graced with breathtaking surroundings-

176
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:45,381
"I My terraces,
open courtyards,

177
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,758
domes, arches".

178
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:51,967
And canopied balconies
abound with opulent comfort.

179
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:56,180
Indeed the entire building
exudes historical ambience...

180
00:09:56,262 --> 00:10:02,190
and transports one back in time to
the proud tradition of the Raj

181
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,862
Is that good?
It is. It is.

182
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:08,363
Very good.

183
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:13,955
Thirty-six years, four months since
the day we were called to the bar,

184
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,203
and you've never once
talked about India.

185
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,250
Do you want
any of these books?

186
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,496
You might be needing them again.

187
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,339
- Mrs. Megson.
- Sir?

188
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,757
I want you to have this.

189
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,260
Are you sure?
Oh, absolutely.

190
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,804
Th-There's a little crack there
just on the bottom,

191
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,052
but I think you know something
about that already.

192
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,432
I used to live there...

193
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,481
a long time ago.

194
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,358
There won't be
any golf courses.

195
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,281
Well, that's just as well.
I can't afford the green fees.

196
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,904
But a retirement home?

197
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,657
It's a luxury development."

198
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,204
where all the residents
are in their golden years.

199
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,907
Like the Costa Brava?

200
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,244
Yeah, but with more elephants.

201
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:09,007
You know
who'll be there- Indians.

202
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,837
Loads of them.

203
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,548
Brown faces and black hearts.

204
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,430
Reeking of curry.

205
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,887
And you never see one
on their own, do you?

206
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,223
I mean, they always-
they move in packs.

207
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:24,230
Makes it easier to rob you
blind, cut your throat,

208
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:27,529
You know what?
You can wheel yourself from here.

209
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,324
You're supposed to
take me to my flat.

210
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,777
My wife's from Mumbai.

211
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,659
Well, don't blame me, mate.
You married her.

212
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,041
My wife's from Mumbai.

213
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:49,467
Has anyone thought about what happens
when you get to the other end?

214
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,045
They said somebody's
going to meet us in Jaipur.

215
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,139
How are we going to know
you're all right?

216
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,936
Well, I'll call.
They do have phones there, you know.

217
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,475
Or you can read my blog.
Your what?

218
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,056
On the lnterweb.

219
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,642
Just log in whenever you
like and read my news.

220
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,353
Well, I hope the first item
will be announcing your return.

221
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,404
I don't suppose they'll be
paying for the journey back.

222
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,202
Look, before I go, I wonder, could
you say one thing that's supportive?

223
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,997
I've never done anything like
this in the whole of my life.

224
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,245
You've never done
anything at all without Dad.

225
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,669
I don't think you'll
be able to cope. Well,

226
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,712
let's just ind out,
shall we?

227
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:32,548
And the connecting flight to
Jaipur is first class too?

228
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:33,719
That's right.

229
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,968
I tell you. it's tough
to get upgraded nowadays.

230
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:38,345
I had to flirt so hard
with the travel agent,

231
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,552
it was practically
phone sex.

232
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,526
Oh.

233
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,240
Well, this is my lucky day.

234
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,816
Sir.

235
00:12:57,277 --> 00:13:00,281
We'd like to take a look in
this bag, madam, if you don't mind.

236
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,457
What have you
got in here anyway?

237
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,409
It's just PG Tips.

238
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:06,836
And some brown sauce.

239
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,960
Thirty-one packets
of chocolate Hobnobs.

240
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:15,674
That's pickled onions
and, yeah, pickled eggs.

241
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,801
And that's just pickles.
Pickles.

242
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,724
- No liquids on the plane.
- What's that mean?

243
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,394
It means you can't take
the pickled onions...

244
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,221
or the pickled eggs.

245
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,891
The pickles fine.

246
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,442
Oh!

247
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,962
Obviosly, one
has read one's Kipling,

248
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:35,008
but we view this as an opportunity
to explore another culture,

249
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,585
as well as making
new friends.

250
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:41,013
And a High Court judge is just the
class of guest one was hoping for.

251
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,308
isn't it, Douglas?

252
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,600
Sorry?

253
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:48,062
And, um, is this your
first time in India? Yes.

254
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,855
You don't look like
an experienced traveler.

255
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:51,808
Oh, I'm not.

256
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,770
But one has read one's guidebooks.

257
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,988
It should be there.
No.

258
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,406
Oh.

259
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,778
Oh. Hi.

260
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,736
Hello. We haven't met.
Norman Cousins.

261
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,821
Madge Hardcastle.
A pleasure.

262
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,827
Play your cards right,
and it could be.

263
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:10,043
Look. My chair, What?
Oh, yes, yes. Hang on.

264
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,041
May I have your attention, please?

265
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,000
We regret to announce cancellation
of Flight 105 to Jaipur,

266
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,926
owing to bad weather
at the destination.

267
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,504
We apologize
for any inconvenience caused

268
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,101
Right.

269
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,898
Of course iris a good idea.

270
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,773
Who can one trust
if not a High Court judge?

271
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:38,071
I suppose this way
we see more of the country.

272
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,524
If anyone asks,
say you're my mother.

273
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,825
I don't want people
to think we're together.

274
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,573
In your dreams.

275
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,825
Douglas, these are not words
that often pass my lips,

276
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,202
but you may actually
be right.

277
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:53,082
This country seems rather more
civilized than one originally thought.

278
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,548
Okay. Thank you.

279
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:13,440
The bus- The bus will take us
to the center of the town,

280
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,892
and then we can get tuk-tuks
the rest of the way,

281
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,566
What did he say?
So it's down there. Yeah, it's down there.

282
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,819
Down here. The yellow one.
That one.

283
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,400
But look at the bus!

284
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,612
There's not enough room!

285
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,573
First rule of India-
There's always room.

286
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,952
There we are.

287
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,582
Ah.

288
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,708
Sorry.

289
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,831
In you go. What larks, Pip!

290
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,293
Well, let's hope so.

291
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,625
Oh!

292
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,763
Oh!

293
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,714
I'm really
loving this.

294
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,853
Oh, Thank you.

295
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,478
Are you insane?

296
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,611
Avoid all food
not from a reputable vendor.

297
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,909
It'll be washed
in impure water.

298
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,952
It's just a sandwich.

299
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:53,156
Oh, marvelous. Then I'll have
ham, cheese and streptococcus.

300
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,247
Or perhaps bacteria,
lettuce and tomato.

301
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,623
Huh.

302
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,626
Would you like some of this?

303
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:04,175
I believe it's called
aloo ka paratha.

304
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,595
No, if I can't pronounce it,
I don't want to eat it.

305
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,090
How long since
you've been here?

306
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,918
Forty years.

307
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,093
Oh.

308
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,046
That's as long
as I was married.

309
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,341
My husband died recently.

310
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:54,926
Oh, I'm sorry.

311
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,519
Do you think
we'll be all right?

312
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,066
God, don't ask me.

313
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,481
I'm more scared than you are.
Oh.

314
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,072
No.

315
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,116
It's going to be
extraordinary.

316
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,292
What exactly is a tuk-tuk?

317
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,465
Oh, look! What's that? Look!

318
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,106
Oh!

319
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,311
Ah!

320
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,636
ls this it?

321
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,635
Well

322
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,356
Here! Watch it!
Sorry.

323
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:57,052
Welcome to The Best
Exotic Marigold Hotel!

324
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,524
Oh!

325
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:26,210
There's an Indian in there.

326
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,631
Ah.

327
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,899
This will do.

328
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:55,739
Bird in room.

329
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:05,534
This is a building
of the utmost character;

330
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:09,211
which means that perhaps not everything
will function in the way you expect it to.

331
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,959
But, as the manager."

332
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,632
and chief executive supervising
officer of this Marigold Hotel,

333
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:17,462
I can tell you with great pride that the
building has stood for centuries...

334
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:22,597
and will continue to stand for many
more in 100% shipshape condition.

335
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,894
Please follow me, carefully
avoiding that naughty stone there.

336
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,892
Around this corner,

337
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,144
leading us most successfully
all the way to-

338
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:30,975
your bedroom.

339
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,482
Where?

340
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,734
Here. In here.

341
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,657
My dear man,
rooms have doors.

342
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,951
What you're showing me here
is an alcove.

343
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,529
A door is coming soon,
most definitely,

344
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:44,989
How soon?

345
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:48,372
Let us not concern ourselves
with details, Mrs. Hardcastle.

346
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,077
Rather than speaking
of doors,

347
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,913
we should instead take pleasure
in the freedom to roam.

348
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,166
Does your room have a door?
A most effective one.

349
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:58,298
Good. Then that's
where I'll be staying.

350
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,385
You will be
coming to the hospital...

351
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:05,343
once you ire satisfactorily
recovered from your journey.

352
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:12,521
The operation requires a stay of five days,
and it is done under general anesthesia.

353
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,355
A hip replacement usually
takes only two hours.

354
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:19,486
Your surgeon will remove
the top end of the thighbone...

355
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,694
and insert
an artificial bone instead.

356
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,904
A most routine procedure.

357
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:27,115
Have you got
a marker pen on you?

358
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,449
Why?

359
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,000
I want to mark it.

360
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,328
I don't want you
to do the wrong hip.

361
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:38,251
I want to stay at the other hotel,
the one that's in the brochure.

362
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,803
Mrs. Ainslie,
prepare to be amazed.

363
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:42,926
This is that very building,
madam.

364
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,598
You Photoshopped it!

365
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,222
No. I have offered a vision
of the future.

366
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:49,770
Of course, I'd hoped that by
now it would be the present.

367
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:52,314
But, you know, in India,
we have a saying-

368
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,687
Everything will be
all right in the end.

369
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,316
So if it is not all right,
it is not yet the end.

370
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,318
What will start to make it all right
is if you'll give us a refund.

371
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:03,321
Of course. Of course. If that is what
you desire, then you must have it.

372
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,074
Absolutely no problem. I'll refund you completely.

373
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:07,993
You will?
Most definitely, madam.

374
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,036
Straightaway?
I most definitely will.

375
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,083
Straightaway
in three months, okay?

376
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:17,131
Um, have you tried, um,
jiggling it about a bit?

377
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:18,924
Yes, I did that.

378
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:23,675
Did you kind of bang it lightly
on the desk a few times?

379
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,506
Yes, I did that too.

380
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,887
Okay. Um-

381
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,681
Right.

382
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:41,276
How do you come
to be in India?

383
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:42,948
Oh, uh- Oh.

384
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:46,323
I invested our-
well, my retirement money."

385
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:49,406
in our daughter's
Internet company.

386
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:55,086
She assured me that as soon as the
start-up actually, uh, started up...

387
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:00,462
and the conversion from virtual to
actual became sufficiently viable,

388
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:03,090
then she'd be able to pay it all back.

389
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,671
I'm not sure I understand
what most of those words mean.

390
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:09,133
Well, it turns out
neither did she.

391
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,060
Ah. There you are.
Good as new.

392
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,850
Really?
No, of course not.

393
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:22,571
Now, would you like me
to, um, not ix that chair?

394
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,614
Because I could almost
certainly do that as well.

395
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:34,663
How long have I
waited for this moment...

396
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:38,588
to present to you,
in honor of your arrival,

397
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:41,962
a special Welcome Britishâ
roast for you all.

398
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,759
Cooked lovingly by myself...

399
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:47,964
and my most loyalist helper
and friend, Young Wasim.

400
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,846
- Roast what?
- A wonderful taste of Blighty.

401
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,847
Roast what?

402
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,769
Roast goat curry.

403
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:58,315
Gentle friends, you have found
your way to this place,

404
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,234
bequeathed to me
by my beloved father,

405
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,405
that I have raised from the
ruins of his broken dreams.,.

406
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,110
And renamed The Best
Exotic Marigold Hotel.,.

407
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:11,822
For the Elderly and Beautiful.

408
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:15,829
Yes. I use these words
most deliberately.

409
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,957
For you have all heard
the chimes at midnight,

410
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,209
and long in tooth
have you become.

411
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:24,876
Who knows how many days
you have left?

412
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:29,213
But we are most honored that you have
chosen to spend that time with us.

413
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,388
Please-

414
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:32,091
Oh!

415
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:34,093
What's he got?
Douglas, do something.

416
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,349
Let me through, please.
My brother is a doctor.

417
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,896
Sorry, please.

418
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,608
This man is dead.
Oh, my God!

419
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:53,783
Please, we must cover his face.
We should preserve his dignity at this terrible moment.

420
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,503
I'm sorry, buddy.

421
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,716
- He coughed. I saw him cough.
- He moved.

422
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:07,714
He's alive.

423
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,008
Did- Did I nod off?

424
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:19,646
All is right. He didn't die.

425
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,226
I was looking forward to that meal.
it's hell.

426
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,570
I was frightened.
I'm in hell.

427
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:39,959
Marigold
Hotel, Jaipur. Day nine.

428
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:45,290
Old habits die easier than
we think, and new ones form.

429
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:48,717
No longer do I reach out
in the .morning for Radio 4.

430
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:52,092
My news comes instead
from the Jaipur Herald.

431
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:59,767
Soon, I might even grow accustomed to
the storm of car horns and vendors.

432
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:01,639
One moment.

433
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,816
The carburetor, sir,
Carburetor is broken.

434
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:07,441
Can there be anywhere else
in the world...

435
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,489
that is such an assault
an the senses ?

436
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:18,285
Those who know the country of old
just go about their business.

437
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:24,044
Bu! nothing can prepare
the uninitiated. ..

438
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,043
For this riot
of noise and color;

439
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,250
for the heat the motion,

440
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,795
the perpetual teeming crowds.

441
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:40,136
Soony is conducting his own
personal assault on our senses...

442
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:43,940
with a How of exotic dishes he
demands daily from the kitchen.

443
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:47,731
Mooli moong dal,

444
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,686
bagara baingan,

445
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,818
banjara gosht,

446
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,649
paneer methi chaman,

447
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,826
mutton vindaloo.

448
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,993
Initially, you're overwhelmed.

449
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,623
But gradually
you realizeit's like a wave.

450
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,047
Resist
and you'll be knocked over.

451
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,173
Mrs. Donnelly!

452
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:20,517
Drive into it, and you'll
swim out the other side.

453
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:28,441
Excuse me, I wonder, could you
direct me to this address?

454
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,821
No more. No more.
I don't have any more.

455
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,523
I haven't got any more.

456
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,574
This is a new
and different world.

457
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,240
The challenge
is to cope with ft.

458
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,750
And not just cope, but thrive.

459
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:53,167
Graham was talking about
this marvelous temple.

460
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,344
I thought you might
want to come with me.

461
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:57,513
I'm your wife. Have we met?

462
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,385
Would you really rather
stay here all day?

463
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,013
Yes,
given the alternative.

464
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:06,518
When I walk out in the morning,
all the street kids smile at me.

465
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,394
That's 'cause
you give them money.

466
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,941
Um, okay.

467
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,436
I'll go on my own.

468
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,875
- This can't be right, surely.
- I am thinking so, saab.

469
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,832
There used to be houses all along there.
These were homes.

470
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,008
I can take you
some other place?

471
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,174
No. No, no, no. No.

472
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,676
That will be all for now.
Thank you.

473
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,095
Here. Thank you very much.
Thank you, sir.

474
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,770
Um, excuse me.
Yeah?

475
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:53,648
- Uh, there used to be houses here.
- All knocked down.

476
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,823
What about the people,
the families?

477
00:30:57,898 --> 00:31:00,617
They moved to
a different place.

478
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:10,544
Uh, don't- don't grip it so
tightly with your right hand.

479
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:11,871
The bat.

480
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,500
Yes, it's just there
for guidance.

481
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,003
You keep
your left elbow high."

482
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,632
so you play through the ball.

483
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:20,550
Thank you.
Okay,

484
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:36,402
You're ready to go home,
Mrs. Donnelly.

485
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,480
That's not my home.

486
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,565
I want to go back
to England.

487
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:44,745
As soon as you can stand up and
walk onto the plane, you can.

488
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,198
Until then, I will assist
in your recuperation.

489
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:50,659
How is the hip feeling?

490
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,004
They must have got lucky.

491
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,507
It's strange.

492
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,552
The more operations they
perform, the luckier they get.

493
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,364
Oh.

494
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:32,418
I didn't realize.
Um, sorry.

495
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,213
Oh!

496
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,131
Oh, I'm so sorry.

497
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,503
I'm dreadfully sorry.

498
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,547
Yes?
Sorry.

499
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,720
I'm just looking
for this address.

500
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,057
Yes.
Do you understand?

501
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,760
Could you help me
find this place?

502
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:51,345
Yes.

503
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:55,558
Is that, yes, you do understand
or, yes, you could help me?

504
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,105
Yes. Yes.
Oh.

505
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:00,608
Well, let's just
go with both, shall we?

506
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:01,939
Yes.

507
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:11,407
Oh!

508
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,553
Yes.

509
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:36,606
Give me the ball.

510
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,476
I can take him.

511
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,563
Down is where
you are going, uncle.

512
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:44,319
You do your worst.

513
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,992
Come on, Sanjay.
You can do it.

514
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,543
Come on, Sanjay.

515
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:12,434
I felt the need,
the need for speed.

516
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:13,761
Yes!

517
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,981
Are you all right, uncle?

518
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:22,486
Yes. Yes, I'm fine.

519
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,117
Oh.

520
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:46,547
We do appreciate your custom,
which is very important to us.

521
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,505
And can I draw your attention
to our special new-

522
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,314
Are you sure I can't
offer you something?

523
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:02,984
We have some, uh, English breakfast
tea, Building tea, as you call it.

524
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,562
A builder's tea?
Builder's tea.

525
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,113
No, thank you. I'm fine.

526
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,815
So, tell me. How can I help you?

527
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:12,027
I don't think you can. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have come.

528
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,532
No, wait.

529
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:15,990
It's just that I saw your
advertisement in the local newspaper,

530
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:19,201
and it specifically mentioned the
ability to talk to older people.

531
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:22,709
But this wasn't
what I imagined.

532
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,336
- You came for a job?
- I'm sorry. I've wasted your time.

533
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:29,795
Look, everyone working here is a
graduate from a good university.

534
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:33,052
This is a place for ambitious
people, young people.

535
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,724
Yes, I see that now.
I'm sorry.

536
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,517
No. Please, sit down.

537
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:38,812
Sit down. Please.

538
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,393
So it is really builder's tea?

539
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:48,772
Yes. We dunk biscuits
into it.

540
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,357
You dunk?

541
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:55,115
Well, it means lowering the
biscuit into the tea...

542
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:57,493
and letting it
soak in there."

543
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:01,076
and trying to calculate the exact
moment before the biscuit dissolves...

544
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,378
when you can whip it up
into your mouth...

545
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:06,798
and enjoy the blissful union
of biscuit and tea combined.

546
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,961
It is more relaxing
than it sounds,

547
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:14,764
Perhaps you can
help us after all.

548
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,773
I thought
you weren't coming.

549
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,524
Have I ever let you down?

550
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:31,152
Um-
Don't answer that.

551
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,738
I have to go.

552
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:36,491
Leave this place.
Come to work for me.

553
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,321
You can't afford me.

554
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:39,952
I can't afford anything.

555
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,157
I miss you.

556
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:43,118
Am I coming round tonight?

557
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,330
Uh, let's meet somewhere else.
I will rent a hotel room.

558
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:49,383
Sonny, you own a hotel.
It has many rooms.

559
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:53,337
Some of which are now occupied
with actual real guests.

560
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,138
Paying guests?

561
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,137
Why must you nitpick?
It is not an attractive quality.

562
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,470
Sunaina.

563
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,523
Hello, Jay.

564
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:06,724
Sonny boy.

565
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,560
Don't call me that.

566
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,613
If you're gonna mess around with
my sister, don't do it in public.

567
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:13,482
Let's go.

568
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,879
Good evening, Your Honor.

569
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:36,213
Ah, good evening, Mrs. Ainslie.
You have a good day?

570
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:38,173
What did you get up to?

571
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,350
Well, I started
in my bedroom,

572
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:43,725
where I spent a happy couple of hours
giving all the cockroaches names.

573
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:48,058
And then, after a lunch that will
long have a place in my heartburn,

574
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:50,769
I came out here
and stared blindly at a book,

575
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:53,901
waiting for someone-
anyone- to rescue me.

576
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:58,069
And how glad I am
it was you.

577
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,529
Why would you not go out?
There's so much to see.

578
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,750
All life is here, Mrs. Ainslie.
I tell you.

579
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:10,046
Oh, I could have a word
with the chef if you like,

580
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:13,170
Perhaps some grilled chicken
and plain rice?

581
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,251
That would be
much appreciated.

582
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,424
All right.

583
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,009
Good evening.

584
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:57,256
Good evening.

585
00:38:57,377 --> 00:39:00,051
Please. Please, sit down.
Oh.

586
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,130
Thank you.

587
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:03,057
I trust you had
a good day.

588
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,260
I'd rather hear about yours.

589
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:08,267
I got a job-
my first ever.

590
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,690
I'm going to be a sort of
cultural adviser.

591
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:14,520
A role I'm sure you'll perform
with great distinction.

592
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:17,446
Perhaps you wouldn't
mind keeping that to yourself.

593
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:20,526
Well, I-I-I'm flattered
you told me about it.

594
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,030
Good evening, the Ainslies.

595
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,870
Did you have a good day?
Spectacular actually.

596
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:29,209
I went to the temple you told me about,
a place of meditation and peace.

597
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:30,957
It was quite stunning.

598
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,834
So spiritual, I bet you never
noticed the smell of elephant dung.

599
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,712
No elephants, sadly.

600
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,169
I thought I might see you there.
Where did you get to instead?

601
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:41,471
Yes, where do you
get to every day?

602
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:44,390
Well, I-I've just been telling
Mrs. Greenslade all about it.

603
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,217
I'm sure she wouldn't
mind hearing it again.

604
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:50,147
Oh, I talked to the chef for you.
Absolutely no problem.

605
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,894
Did you hear that, Douglas?

606
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:54,692
Plain grilled food,
Manna from heaven.

607
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,779
I don't have Io have it too, do I?
I can't thank you enough.

608
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:59,572
You really should
see this temple.

609
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,274
Oh, I'd like to very much.

610
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,860
But maybe take
a clothes-peg for your nose.

611
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,663
Good night.
Good night.

612
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,918
Um, Mrs. Greenslade?

613
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,508
Evelyn.

614
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:22,717
Would you mind
if I showed you something?

615
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:27,388
I grew up here,
just a short drive away.

616
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,099
It was a big house.
We had servants.

617
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:34,308
Oh, we knew their wives
and children, and...

618
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,610
one of the boys, uh, Manoj-

619
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,232
Oh.

620
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,191
He, um-
He became my friend.

621
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:47,863
And, uh, we played lots
of cricket together, and-

622
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:52,873
Well, we played everything together, and-and
it stayed like that for a few years.

623
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,168
And then, um-

624
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,123
And then one night, it, uh-

625
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:01,050
it became something else.

626
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:06,139
We had a few months together.
We had that.

627
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:09,434
And, um- And then there was
a weekend in Udaipur...

628
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:15,187
where... we were sitting by a lake
and watching the sun go down.

629
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:20,316
And, uh, I remember thinking that I-I
would never be this happy again.

630
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,110
And- And I was right.

631
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,866
Because, suddenly,
it was over.

632
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:32,245
We'd fallen asleep,
and they found us.

633
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,165
Well, it was bad enough
for me.

634
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:39,498
But I knew who I was, and I
think my family guessed.

635
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,332
But for-

636
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:46,673
for Manoj, the-
the disgrace was absolute.

637
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:50,304
His father was fired.
His family was sent away, all of them.

638
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,063
And, uh,

639
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:57,140
well, I don't know
what I could have done.

640
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,942
But it should have been
more than nothing.

641
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:03,113
I just-
I just let it happen.

642
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:07,112
I didn't put up
any kind of a tight. I-

643
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:11,121
And then, um-

644
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,914
Then I went back to England,
to-to-to university.

645
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:19,960
And, uh, I always said, you know, I'm
going to go back. I shall go back.

646
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,584
And I never did.

647
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,174
Until now.

648
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,132
Until now.

649
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,602
And now I think-

650
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:40,150
What if I'm the last person in
the world that he wants to see?

651
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:44,479
Do you want to see him?
Yes.

652
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:49,025
Yes, yes.

653
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:52,070
Then you must.

654
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,878
So now that we are
fully operational, Mr. Maruthi,

655
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:53,597
it is clear that, with a small injection
of funds for the phase two development,

656
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:57,723
The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
can rise like a phoenix...

657
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:59,850
to its previous stale of glory.

658
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:02,432
And, look,
when I say small injection,

659
00:44:02,515 --> 00:44:05,394
I mean small in the sense
of, uh, medium-sized.

660
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:10,528
- Possibly larger.
- Well, this hotel was never glorious.

661
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,950
Just the phoenix part then.

662
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,320
How many rooms will there be?
Many. Mmm.

663
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,121
How many?
A great amount.

664
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,823
Plenty of rooms.
No question.

665
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:21,918
I'm not a details man, Mr.
Maruthi. Nor was your father.

666
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:25,668
Mr. Maruthi, I present to you
one of our beloved guests.

667
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,248
Dear Mrs. Donnelly,

668
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,710
please can you describe to us in
as much detail as you desire...

669
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:34,297
your experience of the
ambience and atmosphere."

670
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,974
of The Best Exotic
Marigold Hotel.

671
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:40,220
Words fail me.

672
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:48,232
Ah, the English wit
we love so greatly.

673
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:49,813
Thank you, madam.

674
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:54,276
See, the wheel is spinning, but,
you know, the hamster is dead.

675
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:58,488
- Mummyji what are you doing here?
- You called. I came.

676
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:00,824
No, I couldn't have called.
The phones don't work.

677
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:04,081
That's why I came.

678
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:09,712
- Wait! Mummyji this is my office!
- Who is that man out there?

679
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,339
The contents of that desk are mine.
Do not open the drawers.

680
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,012
I must insist that you
do not open the drawers.

681
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:16,384
Tell me.
Why have you come?

682
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:18,558
Do I need a reason
to visit my favorite son?

683
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:22,019
No. He's in his mansion in Delhi.
All right. My second favorite.

684
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:23,687
He went to Canada
to make his fortune.

685
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:27,063
- And make it, he did.
- As I will make mine!

686
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:30,020
I have a dream, Mummyji.
A most brilliant one.

687
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:33,151
To outsource old age.
And it is not just for the British.

688
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:36,276
There are many other countries where
they don't like old people too.

689
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:39,704
Sonny, your brothers own
one-third of this hotel each.

690
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:42,407
They're also entitled to
one-third of the profits, no?

691
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:45,744
Success does not
happen overnight, Mummyji.

692
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:50,999
This is blue-sky thinking, and it requires
long-term strategy and-and-and patience.

693
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:53,380
How is your girlfriend?

694
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,177
I look forward
to you meeting her.

695
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:57,972
And I look forward to your meeting
the girl you're going to marry.

696
00:45:58,047 --> 00:46:01,051
She comes from a very good family
in Delhi, beta, a very good family.

697
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:04,512
I can marry as I choose, Mummyji.
I don't need anyone's permission.

698
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:08,395
I presume it is your girlfriend who tills
your head with this nonsense, huh?

699
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,818
A very good reason
not to marry her.

700
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:14,030
What if I love her?
An even better reason.

701
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:16,904
Now go and get Young Wasim to come
and get my luggage from the car.

702
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:20,954
He cannot carry. He has a dicky back.
Wait. Your luggage?

703
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:24,791
How long are you staying?
As long as it takes.

704
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:37,837
Dear, you won't get anywhere
sweeping like that.

705
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,016
I was in service for years.
Looked after a lovely house.

706
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:46,392
Kept it spotless.
You need to put more pressure on the brush.

707
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,643
She won't speak English.

708
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:50,942
She's what they used to call
an untouchable.

709
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:53,736
To a good Hindu,
even her shadow is polluted.

710
00:46:54,437 --> 00:46:55,484
Namaste-

711
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:04,823
Where do you go every day?
ls it a woman?

712
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,374
Go for a curry?
Have a bit of afters?

713
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:10,708
No, no, no. I don't think so.

714
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,288
I'm, um-

715
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,123
I'm gay. Uh-

716
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:17,585
Though nowadays,
more in theory than in practice.

717
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,545
But I-I-I'll see you later.

718
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:46,872
[Man ] The Viceroy Club was opened
by the great Lord Kitchener himself,

719
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:50,121
and many of its fixtures have
remained unchanged since then.

720
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:52,295
Yes, I see that.

721
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,623
Perhaps you could tell me a
little about the clientele.

722
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:59,465
Any maharajas, wealthy
widowed landowners?

723
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:03,764
It is not the policy of this club to
divulge details of our members, madam.

724
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,638
- Good morning, Your Excellency.
- Very good morning.

725
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,432
Where do I sign up?

726
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:12,265
The admission fee
is 120,000 rupees,

727
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:16,023
and, thereafter, it will be
15,000 rupees each month.

728
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:20,482
I wonder if I might get a little
discount, owing to my status.

729
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,032
Your status, madam?

730
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:24,736
Yes. One was rather hoping
to fly under the radar,

731
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:26,867
but one is a member
of the royal family.

732
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:29,536
Which member, madam?
I'm Princess Margaret.

733
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,581
It is most certainly
an honor to meet you, madam.

734
00:48:33,661 --> 00:48:36,130
And may I say
how well you look,

735
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:38,674
especially taking into account
that you died nine years ago.

736
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,971
Your real name please, madam,
and 120,000 rupees.

737
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:56,017
You know where he goes.

738
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,654
I know you know,
but you won if tell me.

739
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:05,572
I can get Hobnobs out here,
you know. I know a way.

740
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:09,330
As many as you like.

741
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:11,248
Milk or plain.

742
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,920
Public records office.

743
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:26,263
My mother doesn't
want us to be married.

744
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,475
She hasn't met me yet.
She doesn't need to meet you.

745
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,143
She knows you're
not from Delhi,

746
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:34,597
that you have no family money,
and you work in a call center.

747
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,775
You're part of a modern India
she cannot welcome.

748
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:40,486
Then you must tell her what you want.
I'm trying.

749
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:41,687
Try harder.

750
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:45,900
Do you love me, Sonny?

751
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,827
My feelings for you cannot
be reduced to a single word.

752
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:52,328
It's a nice word.
People like hearing it.

753
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:56,456
You know, it will be easier to talk to
my mother when the hotel is a success.

754
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,082
And what if it isn't?

755
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:00,631
Everything will be
all right in the end.

756
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:03,300
And if it is not all right,
then it is not yet the end.

757
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,761
Sonny!
It will succeed.

758
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:08,843
It has to.

759
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:11,096
Because then you can
stand up to your family?

760
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,561
Because then
I can stand next to you.

761
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,654
Are you all right,
auntie?

762
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:27,825
Uh, yes. I'm about to make the
first public speech of my life.

763
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:34,657
Imagine them naked.
Sony?

764
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,334
It's the way not to be scared
when speaking in public.

765
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:39,082
You imagine people naked.

766
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,459
Well, I'm afraid I gave that up
several years ago.

767
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:48,341
Let's see.

768
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:52,596
Oh, dear.

769
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:11,532
Excuse me, Would there be any
wealthy single men in this evening?

770
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:14,580
Uh, there is one.

771
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:16,703
Perhaps you could
seat me next to him.

772
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:19,285
This way, madam.

773
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:30,217
His Royal Highness,
Prince Michael of Kent.

774
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:41,019
I'll have that back.
Thank you very much.

775
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,937
Ready?
Yes.

776
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,569
- Ring me up.
- Ring you up-

777
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:52,368
As you would.
You know, dial my number.

778
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:57,615
It's ringing.
Hello.

779
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:59,951
Good morning, madam.
And how are you today?

780
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:04,084
Oh, no. That won't do for a start.
That's much too nursie.

781
00:52:04,163 --> 00:52:06,757
I feel as if I'm on my deathbed.

782
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:09,585
if I could just take a few moments
of your time to tell you about-

783
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,636
How long
will you actually take?

784
00:52:11,754 --> 00:52:13,927
Twelve minutes.
Then you've lied to me already.

785
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:16,555
No, I can't talk to you.
I'm watching TV.

786
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:18,511
Why does she need
12 minutes?

787
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:21,313
Well, we believe the longer we
keep our customers on the phone,

788
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:24,483
the more receptive
they'll be to our message.

789
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,560
It's my favorite program.

790
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:28,772
Yes, but I really think if you
heard some of our special-

791
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:32,529
No, no. Don't talk like a robot.
Now just talk to me.

792
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:34,281
You've heard
I'm watching TV.

793
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,783
- What are you watching?
- Oh, a marvelous program...

794
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:39,365
where a chap talks to
a panel of young women."

795
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:41,542
whose boyfriends have all
slept with their mothers.

796
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,461
Well, the girlfriends' mothers,
I mean, not-

797
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:46,171
Although-

798
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:50,668
Anyway, the boys have come on,
and everybody's fighting.

799
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:53,095
It sounds amazing.
Hang up right now.

800
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:58,517
- I'm Sunaina.
- Good. Now that's very good.

801
00:52:58,592 --> 00:52:59,889
Evelyn. Evelyn.

802
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,811
Now can I speak to you
about our special offers?

803
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:04,811
Still too soon.
I obviously want to talk.

804
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,608
Is your husband watching
with you, Evelyn?

805
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:11,523
No, No, he died.

806
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,110
Um, perhaps you-

807
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,571
You know, I've actually had
a version of this call.

808
00:53:18,654 --> 00:53:24,878
A little while ago, I talked to someone
who was so constricted by the scripts,

809
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:27,080
well, sales agenda,

810
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:30,211
that she spoke
without a trace of humanity.

811
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,711
As if she hadn't
realized that...

812
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:37,139
I was going completely to
pieces at the end of the phone.

813
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:43,183
You must miss him very much.

814
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:49,443
Now, sympathy's tine.
But be more optimistic.

815
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:55,776
Um, but, you know, sometimes
I ind when one door closes-

816
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:59,203
The rest of them stay shut as well.

817
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:02,782
No, you're right. Of course you're right.
It's a new beginning.

818
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:05,618
Now what do you want
to talk to me about?

819
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:07,336
There.
Three minutes?

820
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:11,003
Well, either I've saved you nine,
or I've talked myself out of a job.

821
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:15,715
I still think
you're cramping my style.

822
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,888
Oh, please.
You have no style to cramp.

823
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,432
That lady at the bar
keeps looking at me.

824
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:24,016
As one would
something in a museum.

825
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,096
Why must you mock?

826
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,978
I just want to
feel young again.

827
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:33,688
To feel needed as much as I
need, if only for one night.

828
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:38,277
One wonderful night.

829
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:42,204
Tell me you don't know
how that feels.

830
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:47,330
Give me a minute
and then come and join me.

831
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,422
Rejected again.

832
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:03,426
Many years ago that man over there gave me
the most extraordinary night of my life.

833
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:08,222
To describe his bedroom skill
as technique would-

834
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:12,026
- Those drinks not ready yet?
- They say patience is passion tamed.

835
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,569
- I'm Madge.
- Carol.

836
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:17,235
And this is Norman.
How do you do?

837
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:20,409
Carol. As in Christmas.

838
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:23,078
- I suppose.
- Great.

839
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,281
So what brings you
to Jaipur, Carol?

840
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:28,163
Yes, Carol. What, uh-
What brings you to Jaipur?

841
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:32,247
Actually, I've lived here all my life.
My father worked for the foreign office.

842
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,466
- You're very Ht.
- Beg your pardon?

843
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:41,430
- Oh, God.
- You look like you keep yourself in good shape, physically.

844
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:45,681
Well- I
did join a gym last year.

845
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:48,729
It cost a fortune,
and I didn't get any fitter.

846
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:51,432
Apparently, you actually have to go.

847
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,068
Ah!

848
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:03,407
So, um,
what do you do, Norman?

849
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:04,611
- Me?
- Yes.

850
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:06,283
Norman's in business.
Well, I- Yes.

851
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,706
- What business?
- You tell her.

852
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,033
Import-export.

853
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:11,744
Although nowadays, there's
rather more than im."

854
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:15,047
- If you know what I mean.
- No, I'm afraid I don't.

855
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:19,919
I have to go and splash
some water on my face.

856
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:21,845
Please, God,
I drown in it.

857
00:56:29,428 --> 00:56:32,557
Well, look. It's been lovely chatting.
No, it hasn't.

858
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,641
No, it hasn't.
But I really have to go.

859
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:37,274
Look, Carol, Carol.

860
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:41,531
Can we drop
all this pretense?

861
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:44,281
Start again?

862
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:47,158
I'm not charming.
I'm not good at repartee. And-

863
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:55,045
My name's Norman,
and I'm lonely.

864
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:59,417
My name's Carol, So am I.

865
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:12,271
Day 22.

866
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:17,523
Like Darwin's finches, we are
slowly adapting to our environment.

867
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,234
And when one does adapt

868
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:24,533
my Goa!
the riches that are available.

869
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:37,709
There is no past that we can
bring back by longing for it

870
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:42,385
Only a present that builds and creates
itself as the past withdraws.

871
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:48,264
Didn't sleep a wink last night.
The tap in there never stopped dripping,

872
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:51,059
Ah. I spoke to Young Wasim
about that.

873
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,853
- What did he say?
- No idea. It was in Hindi.

874
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:59,811
- I thought I might fix it myself.
- You? When?

875
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:02,237
Well, no time
like the present.

876
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:08,903
Where is this? Where are we?

877
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,121
Janta Colony, Kachchi Basti.

878
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,704
Well, what happened
to my usual route?

879
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:16,456
Anokhi has invited you
to her home.

880
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,130
Who's Anokhi?

881
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:22,128
The one who brings
your food.

882
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:24,255
She wants you to meet
her family.

883
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:44,446
How soon can I leave?

884
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:56,283
She wants to thank you
for your kindness.

885
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:59,294
I haven't been kind.

886
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,292
You are the only one
that acknowledges her.

887
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,434
I'm not eating that.

888
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,986
You will insult her
very deeply if you do not.

889
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,714
It's good.

890
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:52,051
Oh!

891
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:55,259
Get off there!
The little bastards! Get off!

892
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:57,390
Get up! Get 'em off there!

893
00:59:57,469 --> 00:59:59,392
Get 'em off me-

894
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:04,393
Ah.

895
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:06,812
I- I di-

896
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:10,820
I didn't know they were playing. I-

897
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:14,115
Sorry.

898
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:19,199
I'm sorry.

899
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:23,875
Sorry.

900
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:31,720
How much for this piece?

901
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:34,344
One thousand rupees.

902
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,095
Thank you.
No, no, no, no.

903
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:40,395
Forgive me. Forgive me. No, no.
That's, um- That's not how it works.

904
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,222
Uh, sorry to butt in.

905
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:45,647
But, uh, you don't ask him how much he wants.
You just tell him how much you'll pay.

906
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:51,820
She'll give you, uh- She'll give you 200.
Absolutely no more, final offer.

907
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:54,117
One thousand rupees.
Pity,

908
01:00:54,234 --> 01:00:56,282
Walk away. Now walk away.
Oh, but-

909
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:58,079
I know what I'm doing.

910
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:01,079
- The thing is I really wanted to buy that.
- He'll come after us.

911
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:04,294
Do you think so?
Absolutely.

912
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,622
This is how the game is played.
Just keep on walking.

913
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:10,008
He's playing it very cool,
but he'll come.

914
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:12,006
Ah.

915
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:16,886
He's playing it
very, very, um, cool.

916
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:21,812
850, 900, 950, 1,000.

917
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,726
Thank you.
Sure.

918
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,648
You'll get him next time.

919
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:28,439
Why are you carrying a tap?

920
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:31,613
You see, what I think, and
of course, I'm no expert,

921
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:35,659
is that the gland nut has
come away from the spindle,

922
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:38,203
so it needs to be
tightened and resealed.

923
01:01:42,461 --> 01:01:44,634
The washer valve has eroded.

924
01:01:44,714 --> 01:01:49,811
Yeah. Uh, well, uh, yeah.
It-It-It could be that too.

925
01:01:49,886 --> 01:01:53,561
- Um, uh, can you ix it?
- Not cheaply.

926
01:01:53,639 --> 01:01:56,768
Not cheaply,
Most expensively indeed.

927
01:02:00,938 --> 01:02:03,817
I was in a- I was in a
tuk-tuk the other day.

928
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,494
It didn't seem to be taking the
usual route back to the hotel.

929
01:02:06,569 --> 01:02:09,539
It turned out the driver had decided
to take me to another hotel...

930
01:02:09,655 --> 01:02:11,373
he was sure I'd prefer.

931
01:02:13,993 --> 01:02:16,872
Of course, one wants to believe that he
genuinely had my welfare at heart...

932
01:02:16,954 --> 01:02:19,457
and that it wasn't
run by his brother-in-law.

933
01:02:19,582 --> 01:02:23,883
One wants to trust
in general, don't you think?

934
01:02:23,961 --> 01:02:25,963
But you never really know.

935
01:02:28,132 --> 01:02:31,636
I met my husband the day
the fair came to town.

936
01:02:31,719 --> 01:02:33,767
My girlfriend and I
went on the carousel.

937
01:02:33,846 --> 01:02:37,646
Her horse was fine,
but when the ride started,

938
01:02:37,725 --> 01:02:42,026
I felt mine give a little,
as if it might collapse.

939
01:02:42,104 --> 01:02:44,198
And then suddenly, I felt
these arms around me,

940
01:02:44,273 --> 01:02:48,369
and a voice in my ear said,
"Just trust me," and I did.

941
01:02:48,444 --> 01:02:50,697
Without question,
till the day he died.

942
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,833
How wonderful.

943
01:02:58,996 --> 01:03:01,215
The sale of our flat
went through last week.

944
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:03,884
I had to sell it
to pay off Hugh's debts.

945
01:03:06,212 --> 01:03:09,682
I've been forced to get a job out
here, which, in fact, I love.

946
01:03:11,050 --> 01:03:14,680
Because even at Sonny's rates,
I couldn't make ends meet.

947
01:03:14,762 --> 01:03:18,437
Not after what happened
to our life savings.

948
01:03:18,516 --> 01:03:22,362
So, no, you're right.
You never know.

949
01:03:48,587 --> 01:03:50,305
Off you go then.
Excuse me.

950
01:03:50,381 --> 01:03:53,055
Off you go. Go home! Go, go!

951
01:04:21,454 --> 01:04:25,425
But I've already filled this form in.
I've given it to you, many times.

952
01:04:25,499 --> 01:04:27,342
There is a process.

953
01:04:27,418 --> 01:04:31,173
You are making an inquiry, and for each
inquiry, a form must be filled in.

954
01:04:31,255 --> 01:04:34,680
But it's the same inquiry
I make every day.

955
01:04:34,759 --> 01:04:37,763
And, therefore,
the same form you must till in.

956
01:04:47,396 --> 01:04:49,319
Mrs. Ainslie.

957
01:04:52,777 --> 01:04:57,328
How can you bear this country?
What do you see that I don't?

958
01:04:58,449 --> 01:05:02,079
Oh, the light, colors.

959
01:05:02,161 --> 01:05:03,879
Smiles.

960
01:05:03,954 --> 01:05:06,377
And-

961
01:05:06,457 --> 01:05:10,758
And the way people see life as a- as
a- as a privilege and-and not a right.

962
01:05:10,836 --> 01:05:12,509
It-It teaches me something.

963
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:19,558
Is that milk pasteurized? Yes, ma'am.
Very, very pasturized."

964
01:05:19,637 --> 01:05:22,607
But that's not true, is it?
You're lying to me just now because-

965
01:05:22,681 --> 01:05:26,311
No, no. It'll be fine.
Thank you.

966
01:05:32,024 --> 01:05:35,028
It was a pleasant surprise
to see you out and about.

967
01:05:36,278 --> 01:05:39,157
Was it?
Yes, yes, it's progress, I think.

968
01:05:40,533 --> 01:05:42,331
I was going to the bank.

969
01:05:44,078 --> 01:05:45,625
To the bank.

970
01:05:45,704 --> 01:05:48,127
Not that there's any reason to
think that something has changed,

971
01:05:48,207 --> 01:05:50,335
but our daughter, Laura,
she did promise,

972
01:05:50,418 --> 01:05:53,513
and one tries to remain
optimistic.

973
01:05:55,506 --> 01:05:57,099
Otherwise-

974
01:05:58,759 --> 01:06:00,432
Otherwise-

975
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:06,059
Actually, I wasn't going to the bank.
I was looking for you.

976
01:06:06,142 --> 01:06:10,147
In fact, I think I've been looking
for you for a very long time.

977
01:06:10,271 --> 01:06:12,649
Mrs. Ainslie.
Jean.

978
01:06:13,774 --> 01:06:15,447
I'm gay.

979
01:06:19,738 --> 01:06:23,959
As in... happy?

980
01:06:27,621 --> 01:06:30,124
Yes, yes. Yes, of course.
I see. I see.

981
01:06:34,378 --> 01:06:35,925
Thank you.

982
01:06:36,005 --> 01:06:37,598
What for?

983
01:06:38,924 --> 01:06:41,473
For averting
my complete humiliation.

984
01:06:44,346 --> 01:06:47,020
As I said,
this country's driving me mad.

985
01:06:49,768 --> 01:06:51,566
Shall we go?

986
01:06:52,605 --> 01:06:54,858
Anything? Not yet,

987
01:06:57,818 --> 01:06:59,786
- How about now?
- One second.

988
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,787
Oh!

989
01:07:04,867 --> 01:07:06,744
- Good Lord!
- What?

990
01:07:06,827 --> 01:07:09,546
Listen,

991
01:07:09,622 --> 01:07:11,590
And now-

992
01:07:12,708 --> 01:07:14,381
No drip!

993
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:17,930
Oh!

994
01:07:18,005 --> 01:07:20,383
No drip! High five.

995
01:07:20,466 --> 01:07:23,640
No, sorry. I don't know why I did that.
I've never done it before in my life.

996
01:07:23,761 --> 01:07:25,889
Mrs. Ainslie.
Darling.

997
01:07:25,971 --> 01:07:28,941
How are you?
Did you have a good day?

998
01:07:29,016 --> 01:07:30,734
Well, let me tell you
about ours.

999
01:07:30,809 --> 01:07:32,152
Your husband of many a year,

1000
01:07:32,228 --> 01:07:33,946
who's never known
which end of a hammer to use,

1001
01:07:34,063 --> 01:07:36,361
has finally managed-
We have to get out of here.

1002
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:39,239
- What did you say?
- I can't stay in this country a moment longer.

1003
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:40,782
Why? Excuse me.

1004
01:07:40,861 --> 01:07:43,865
Pick a reason. Pick ten.
The climate, the squalor.

1005
01:07:43,948 --> 01:07:45,916
The poverty.

1006
01:07:45,991 --> 01:07:48,460
This whole trip
is a grotesque fantasy.

1007
01:07:48,536 --> 01:07:51,005
- It's time we went home,
- Who's paying for the tickets?

1008
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:54,084
Look at us. A group
of self-deluding old fossils."

1009
01:07:54,208 --> 01:07:58,884
traipsing around as if we're on some
bloody gap year, humiliating ourselves.

1010
01:07:59,004 --> 01:08:02,429
Not us. We couldn't pay.
And I don't see you asking our friends back home.

1011
01:08:02,508 --> 01:08:06,263
We should just face up to the truth.
That We're all old. We're all past il.

1012
01:08:06,345 --> 01:08:10,316
That's the real truth.
The raw, unvarnished fact of the matter.

1013
01:08:10,391 --> 01:08:14,396
All we're good for now
is a beige bloody bungalow.

1014
01:08:14,478 --> 01:08:19,450
With a sodding panic button
in the... sodding corner.

1015
01:08:30,619 --> 01:08:33,463
We just have to make
the best of things, darling.

1016
01:08:35,874 --> 01:08:40,254
I really think
that's the best thing to do.

1017
01:08:41,755 --> 01:08:43,507
Yes, well!

1018
01:08:45,217 --> 01:08:47,595
When I want your opinion,
I'll give it to you.

1019
01:09:20,169 --> 01:09:22,513
Come on. Come on.
Pick up. Pick up.

1020
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:26,180
Pick up. Pick up. Pick up.

1021
01:09:26,258 --> 01:09:28,101
Well, in that case,
thank you for your call.

1022
01:09:28,218 --> 01:09:31,267
I'll get back to you as soon as I've
discussed this with my manager.

1023
01:09:31,347 --> 01:09:33,395
Sunaina, I must see you.

1024
01:09:33,474 --> 01:09:37,445
I must. If I cannot hold you in my
arms tonight, I swear I will go mad.

1025
01:09:37,519 --> 01:09:39,112
I yearn for you.

1026
01:09:39,188 --> 01:09:40,531
I burn for you.

1027
01:09:40,606 --> 01:09:43,610
I think it's my sister you're
burning for there, Sonny boy.

1028
01:09:43,692 --> 01:09:46,571
Thank you, Jay. Thank you.

1029
01:09:47,696 --> 01:09:49,289
- Hey.
- Private line, Sunaina.

1030
01:09:49,365 --> 01:09:51,117
Do those words mean
nothing to you?

1031
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:52,793
He took the phone.
What could I do?

1032
01:09:52,868 --> 01:09:55,496
I miss you.

1033
01:09:55,579 --> 01:09:59,254
I miss you every moment,
Come and see me. Tonight.

1034
01:09:59,333 --> 01:10:03,213
I cannot tonight.
It's our parents' 25th wedding anniversary.

1035
01:10:03,295 --> 01:10:05,639
- Tell your mother that.
- Come after. Come late.

1036
01:10:05,756 --> 01:10:08,555
You will be asleep.
No, I'll be waiting.

1037
01:10:08,634 --> 01:10:10,682
You'll be asleep.

1038
01:10:10,761 --> 01:10:12,889
But I can wake you up
in that special way.

1039
01:10:12,971 --> 01:10:15,394
- You'll sneak in?
- I'm not ashamed.

1040
01:10:15,474 --> 01:10:17,397
No, no, no. Neither am I.
Absolutely not.

1041
01:10:17,476 --> 01:10:20,525
There is no shame.
You don't have to sneak.

1042
01:10:20,604 --> 01:10:24,108
Although, if you did want to be
very quiet and not let anyone see,

1043
01:10:24,191 --> 01:10:25,693
it couldn't hurt.

1044
01:10:27,444 --> 01:10:28,946
Su- Sunaina?

1045
01:10:36,537 --> 01:10:38,960
I wanted
to tell you something.

1046
01:10:41,959 --> 01:10:44,758
Would you tell her
I was glad to come?

1047
01:10:45,754 --> 01:10:47,677
Glad she invited me.

1048
01:10:54,763 --> 01:10:58,859
Glad to meet her family-
her grandmother and her kids.

1049
01:11:12,614 --> 01:11:14,708
She asks
if you have children.

1050
01:11:18,537 --> 01:11:21,006
No, I looked after
somebody else's.

1051
01:11:23,709 --> 01:11:26,178
Just this one family.

1052
01:11:26,253 --> 01:11:27,926
Years I was with 'em.

1053
01:11:30,924 --> 01:11:34,269
I ran the house.
Looked after the money, did it all.

1054
01:11:34,386 --> 01:11:37,265
Uh- Cared for them
like they were my own.

1055
01:11:42,144 --> 01:11:46,524
One day, they decided
I needed some help.

1056
01:11:46,648 --> 01:11:49,993
I was grateful.

1057
01:11:50,068 --> 01:11:52,446
And they got this-
this young woman.

1058
01:11:53,989 --> 01:11:56,492
And I tried to teach her.

1059
01:11:56,575 --> 01:11:58,248
Not just the books.

1060
01:11:58,327 --> 01:12:01,922
How to crisp up the bacon, the way the
gentleman preferred it, you know,

1061
01:12:01,997 --> 01:12:04,216
And how the little one liked
to have her hair brushed.

1062
01:12:04,291 --> 01:12:06,840
Just, you know,
little things...

1063
01:12:06,919 --> 01:12:08,842
you only know
if you really care.

1064
01:12:09,838 --> 01:12:13,593
Well, I-
I must've done a good job.

1065
01:12:15,761 --> 01:12:19,891
'Cause they said I was
no longer useful to them.

1066
01:12:19,973 --> 01:12:22,601
They thanked me
for my service."

1067
01:12:22,684 --> 01:12:24,778
as if that was all it was.

1068
01:12:26,688 --> 01:12:31,865
I found, um, a flat in the end.

1069
01:12:31,944 --> 01:12:38,168
My problem was what to do
with all the time I had.

1070
01:12:38,242 --> 01:12:42,873
I mean, the flat- it's so small, I can
have it spotless in half an hour.

1071
01:12:44,039 --> 01:12:46,542
And then, you know,
what am I supposed to do?

1072
01:12:47,292 --> 01:12:48,919
For the rest of the day?

1073
01:12:52,381 --> 01:12:54,884
- Give her these, will you?
- Sure.

1074
01:13:07,646 --> 01:13:09,319
John Smith.

1075
01:13:11,817 --> 01:13:13,945
Mr. John Smith.

1076
01:13:14,778 --> 01:13:17,406
That's right. Me.

1077
01:13:17,489 --> 01:13:19,366
Ah, this way.

1078
01:13:20,492 --> 01:13:22,210

1088
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:18,638
Hello? Marigold Hotel.

1089
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:23,104
ls this it?

1090
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:25,399
This is it.

1091
01:14:25,474 --> 01:14:28,318
You're not worried about the
danger of having sex at your age?

1092
01:14:29,728 --> 01:14:32,231
If she dies, she dies.

1093
01:14:32,314 --> 01:14:36,285
Progress! Progress!
Mrs. Donnelly! Mrs. Hardcastle!

1094
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:39,113
The wheel is turning
most assuredly in our favor!

1095
01:14:39,196 --> 01:14:42,291
Mr. Dashwood, everybody,
great news!

1096
01:14:42,407 --> 01:14:45,661
What is it, Sonny? They are working.
They are working!

1097
01:14:45,744 --> 01:14:48,042
Well, that is good news.
What are working?

1098
01:14:48,121 --> 01:14:51,125
The telephones of the Marigold Hotel.
I must tell everybody.

1099
01:14:51,208 --> 01:14:54,087
I must tell my mother!
Congratulations.

1100
01:14:54,169 --> 01:14:57,173
Mr. Dashwood, wait.
Uh, you have a phone call.

1101
01:15:00,717 --> 01:15:02,765
No way they could Gnd
anything in that office.

1102
01:15:02,844 --> 01:15:05,347
They probably just picked
an address out at random...

1103
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:07,808
just to- just to keep
me off their backs.

1104
01:15:07,891 --> 01:15:10,690
I'm sure
that's what happened.

1105
01:15:10,769 --> 01:15:12,737
It's going to be nothing.

1106
01:15:12,813 --> 01:15:15,942
Don't you think
it's going to be nothing?

1107
01:15:16,024 --> 01:15:18,743
I think you should just
knock on the door and see.

1108
01:15:59,151 --> 01:16:02,325
Oh, I- I'm sorry
to disturb you.

1109
01:16:02,404 --> 01:16:05,374
Um, my name
is Graham Dashwood.

1110
01:16:05,449 --> 01:16:08,669
And, uh, many years ago-

1111
01:16:08,744 --> 01:16:11,497
I know who you are.

1112
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:15,881
I-I-I'm- I'm sorry.
I-I don't know who you are.

1113
01:16:17,169 --> 01:16:21,424
I'm Gaurika,
the wife of Manoj.

1114
01:16:23,425 --> 01:16:26,804
Oh, well, I'm very
pleased to meet you.

1115
01:16:26,887 --> 01:16:33,361
Um, if you could, uh- if you'd,
uh, tell him that I called by,

1116
01:16:33,435 --> 01:16:35,358
I'd very much appreciate it.

1117
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:41,128
What was she thinking?
I beg your pardon?

1118
01:17:41,211 --> 01:17:43,384
His wife, Manoj's wife.

1119
01:17:44,589 --> 01:17:47,308
She knew who Graham was.
Had he told her?

1120
01:17:48,885 --> 01:17:51,104
Do you think we'll find out tomorrow?
Not me.

1121
01:17:51,179 --> 01:17:54,854
I'm heading up to the Badi Mahal Palace.
I'm very excited.

1122
01:17:54,975 --> 01:17:56,977
I've been reading all about it.
Tell me.

1123
01:17:57,060 --> 01:17:58,607
Well, I would
if I could remember-

1124
01:18:09,072 --> 01:18:12,827
Please come. Nice meal.
Romantic music. Please come.

1125
01:18:12,909 --> 01:18:14,707
We've already eaten.
Thank you.

1126
01:18:14,786 --> 01:18:16,880
Please come. Please come.

1127
01:19:44,751 --> 01:19:48,301
A midnight booty call,
how utterly marvelous.

1128
01:19:49,464 --> 01:19:53,344
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1129
01:19:53,426 --> 01:19:55,804
I don't know what your name is,
but I'm incredibly sorry.

1130
01:19:55,887 --> 01:20:00,518
Don't be. It's the most
action I've had in weeks.

1131
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:03,399
- If you would just please-
- Don't worry, Mrs. Hardcastle!

1132
01:20:03,478 --> 01:20:06,402
I can explain each
and-and every thing.

1133
01:20:06,481 --> 01:20:09,655
Oh, my God. You're naked?

1134
01:20:09,734 --> 01:20:12,829
Mrs. Hardcastle, I must apologize
with deep and profound sincerity.

1135
01:20:12,904 --> 01:20:15,123
How could you not tell me
you weren't in your room?

1136
01:20:15,198 --> 01:20:16,950
Yes, Sunaina, to you, too,
I must apologize.

1137
01:20:17,075 --> 01:20:18,577
Now go. Get out.
I'm going to-

1138
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:22,210
What is going on here?
Who screamed?

1139
01:20:23,873 --> 01:20:25,716
No, no, no, no, no.

1140
01:20:25,792 --> 01:20:29,387
This is a respectable hotel,
not a brothel.

1141
01:20:29,462 --> 01:20:32,306
You, take your things
and get out, Get out.

1142
01:20:32,382 --> 01:20:36,728
Mrs. Hardcastle,
I expected better of you.

1143
01:20:36,803 --> 01:20:40,103
Actually, this is exactly what I
expected of you. Nevertheless-

1144
01:20:40,181 --> 01:20:42,809
Mrs. Kapoor,
I'm Sunaina.

1145
01:20:42,892 --> 01:20:44,690
Since I will not be paying
for your services,

1146
01:20:44,769 --> 01:20:48,273
your name is
of no interest to me.

1147
01:20:48,356 --> 01:20:50,450
How do you know mine?

1148
01:20:51,985 --> 01:20:55,364
Because this-
This is my Sunaina.

1149
01:20:59,909 --> 01:21:04,415
This is the girl you described
to me as not too modern?

1150
01:21:04,497 --> 01:21:08,172
- This is getting interesting.
- Mummyji, don't get the wrong idea.

1151
01:21:08,251 --> 01:21:10,219
Sunaina was not here
to be with Mrs. Hardcastle.

1152
01:21:10,295 --> 01:21:12,218
She was here
to have sex with me.

1153
01:21:15,592 --> 01:21:18,141
This is the kind of woman
you are?

1154
01:21:22,932 --> 01:21:26,436
Okay. Each to her own.

1155
01:21:26,519 --> 01:21:30,774
But don't you ever tell me that you
are a suitable wife for my son.

1156
01:21:32,275 --> 01:21:34,619
Just take your things
and get out.

1157
01:21:57,175 --> 01:21:58,973
Sunaina?

1158
01:22:35,964 --> 01:22:37,841
How did it go?

1159
01:22:37,924 --> 01:22:40,552
I've seen
the top of the mountain.

1160
01:22:42,262 --> 01:22:44,185
And it is good.

1161
01:22:50,145 --> 01:22:53,319
I saw someone yesterday.

1162
01:22:54,190 --> 01:22:56,568
A man I haven't seen
for years.

1163
01:22:57,694 --> 01:23:01,244
A man that I've loved
all my life.

1164
01:23:02,031 --> 01:23:04,625
A man?
Yes.

1165
01:23:05,994 --> 01:23:07,667
Carry on.

1166
01:23:08,872 --> 01:23:12,297
I didn't know how he'd been
in the meantime. I-

1167
01:23:12,375 --> 01:23:14,878
I-I-I didn't want to guess,
really,

1168
01:23:14,961 --> 01:23:18,807
'cause I'd brought disgrace
on him and his family,

1169
01:23:18,882 --> 01:23:20,930
and I imagined
he might hate me.

1170
01:23:23,303 --> 01:23:26,477
Well, we talked all night.

1171
01:23:26,556 --> 01:23:28,934
Yeah, he's been happy.

1172
01:23:29,017 --> 01:23:31,770
He's had a peaceful life
and, uh,

1173
01:23:33,521 --> 01:23:36,024
he's never forgotten me.

1174
01:23:37,358 --> 01:23:39,110
That's what he said.

1175
01:23:39,235 --> 01:23:41,454
Hmm.

1176
01:23:43,031 --> 01:23:48,128
All that time, I thought I'd
sentenced him to a life of shame.

1177
01:23:49,746 --> 01:23:51,840
But I was the one in prison.

1178
01:23:55,376 --> 01:23:57,253
But not any more.

1179
01:23:59,839 --> 01:24:01,716
Top of the mountain.

1180
01:24:01,799 --> 01:24:03,767
[Birds Chirping]

1181
01:24:44,217 --> 01:24:46,140
How was the night?

1182
01:24:48,221 --> 01:24:50,474
Rather special.

1183
01:25:14,789 --> 01:25:17,508
Oh! You are back again.

1184
01:25:20,295 --> 01:25:22,468
It's been quite
a remarkable night all around.

1185
01:25:24,424 --> 01:25:25,676
First you tell me your news.

1186
01:25:25,758 --> 01:25:28,978
First you tell me your news
and th-

1187
01:25:52,869 --> 01:25:57,875
Day 45. Of course, it was inevitable.

1188
01:25:59,917 --> 01:26:02,716
Put enough old people
in the same place,

1189
01:26:02,795 --> 01:26:05,765
it won? be too long
before one of them goes.

1190
01:26:08,343 --> 01:26:13,144
Graham dried of a heart condition
which he U had for many years.

1191
01:26:14,599 --> 01:26:18,820
So he knew before he left that
he would not be coming back.

1192
01:26:21,564 --> 01:26:24,443
He wanted to die in India.

1193
01:26:24,525 --> 01:26:27,074
He just didn't want
any of us to know

1194
01:26:34,077 --> 01:26:37,251
He kept his promise
to take me to Jaipur

1195
01:26:39,290 --> 01:26:44,717
Manoj wanted him to have a Hindu
burial there, by the lake.

1196
01:26:44,796 --> 01:26:47,219
At the place
they had visited together.

1197
01:26:49,133 --> 01:26:54,355
Not a holy place.
Although, for them, perhaps it was.

1198
01:26:58,059 --> 01:27:01,188
It takes a long time
for a body to be consumed.

1199
01:27:02,438 --> 01:27:05,612
Many hours for the mourners
lo remember their dead

1200
01:27:09,278 --> 01:27:11,372
The tire must be lit at dawn,

1201
01:27:11,447 --> 01:27:16,078
and by sunset, there must
be nothing left but ash.

1202
01:27:24,168 --> 01:27:27,513
Is it our Mend
we are grieving for,

1203
01:27:27,588 --> 01:27:29,841
whose Me we knew so little?

1204
01:27:34,721 --> 01:27:37,565
Or is it our own loss
that we are mourning?

1205
01:27:40,309 --> 01:27:46,191
Have we traveled far enough that
we can allow our tears ta fall?

1206
01:28:09,422 --> 01:28:13,472
When someone dies,
you think about your own life.

1207
01:28:15,011 --> 01:28:18,185
And I don't want to
grow older.

1208
01:28:18,264 --> 01:28:21,234
I don't want to be
condescended to.

1209
01:28:21,309 --> 01:28:25,280
To become marginalized
and ignored by society.

1210
01:28:27,815 --> 01:28:32,571
I don't want to be the first person they
let off the plane in a hostage crisis.

1211
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:41,375
Hello.
Oh, hello.

1212
01:28:41,454 --> 01:28:46,085
I wondered where you'd been.
We're all having a drink up top.

1213
01:28:46,167 --> 01:28:49,842
I went to see Gaurika,
Manoj's wife.

1214
01:28:50,588 --> 01:28:52,090
Why?

1215
01:28:53,132 --> 01:28:56,682
I wanted to ask her
how much she knew.

1216
01:28:56,761 --> 01:28:59,810
The answer is
that she knew everything.

1217
01:28:59,889 --> 01:29:03,359
That he loved another man,
that he always would,

1218
01:29:03,434 --> 01:29:06,187
He told her when the marriage
was arranged.

1219
01:29:08,439 --> 01:29:10,908
They had no secrets
from each other. None.

1220
01:29:13,653 --> 01:29:15,326
That's right, isn't it?

1221
01:29:16,697 --> 01:29:18,791
That has to be right.

1222
01:29:22,203 --> 01:29:26,174
It made me realize
how much I'd failed Hugh.

1223
01:29:27,416 --> 01:29:31,387
What's the use of a marriage
when nothing is shared?

1224
01:29:35,883 --> 01:29:38,056
Mrs. Greenslade.

1225
01:29:38,135 --> 01:29:40,763
Might I have
my husband back now?

1226
01:29:42,473 --> 01:29:43,770
Douglas?

1227
01:29:45,977 --> 01:29:48,321
Forgive me.
Sorry. Sorry.

1228
01:29:48,437 --> 01:29:51,407
Forgive me.
Sony.

1229
01:29:57,613 --> 01:29:58,865
She was upset.

1230
01:29:58,948 --> 01:30:01,622
Oh, spare me your explanation.
Do you think I'm jealous?

1231
01:30:01,701 --> 01:30:04,796
I don't see why else you would've
embarrassed me and Evelyn.

1232
01:30:04,871 --> 01:30:07,499
You seem to be doing a perfectly
good job of embarrassing yourself.

1233
01:30:07,582 --> 01:30:10,085
Can you imagine how ghastly
it is for everyone...

1234
01:30:10,167 --> 01:30:15,640
to see you mooning around after that
simpering, doe-eyed ex-housewife,

1235
01:30:15,715 --> 01:30:17,638
taking advantage
of her loneliness?

1236
01:30:17,717 --> 01:30:21,062
God, can you hear yourself?
Can you?

1237
01:30:21,137 --> 01:30:25,358
Do you have any idea what a
terrible person you've become?

1238
01:30:25,433 --> 01:30:28,482
All you give out
is this endless negativity.

1239
01:30:28,561 --> 01:30:31,610
A refusal to see
any kind of light and joy,

1240
01:30:31,689 --> 01:30:33,783
even when it's staring you
in the face.

1241
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:38,997
And a desperate need to squash any sign
of happiness in me or-or-or anyone else.

1242
01:30:39,071 --> 01:30:42,041
Li's a wonder I don't fling myself
at the first kind word or gesture."

1243
01:30:42,116 --> 01:30:43,868
that comes my way,
but I don't!

1244
01:30:43,951 --> 01:30:48,957
O-O-Out of some sense
of dried up loyalty and respect.

1245
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:51,543
Neither of which
I ever bloody get in return.

1246
01:31:02,345 --> 01:31:04,347
I checked my e-mails.

1247
01:31:05,431 --> 01:31:08,025
There's one from Laura.

1248
01:31:11,103 --> 01:31:13,151
Are you all right?

1249
01:31:13,230 --> 01:31:15,198
I just want a glass of water.

1250
01:31:16,525 --> 01:31:18,619
That was a gin and tonic.

1251
01:31:20,696 --> 01:31:23,870
- I know that now.
- What's happened?

1252
01:31:23,991 --> 01:31:29,498
Ah. Good evening, the Ainslies.
How are you both?

1253
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:33,881
We're particularly well.
Douglas, tell them our news.

1254
01:31:36,921 --> 01:31:39,015
We're going home.

1255
01:31:41,217 --> 01:31:44,938
And so now I would ask you to loosen the
strings on your purse, Mr. Maruthi,

1256
01:31:45,012 --> 01:31:46,730
and-and do it most rapidly.

1257
01:31:46,806 --> 01:31:48,399
So that phase two development...

1258
01:31:48,474 --> 01:31:52,570
of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
can begin with immediate effect.

1259
01:31:52,645 --> 01:31:54,022
Mrs. Donnelly, I believe.

1260
01:31:54,105 --> 01:31:56,107
Now if you please be following
me to the ground floor-

1261
01:31:56,232 --> 01:31:58,234
How are things at the hotel?
Mr. Maruthi.

1262
01:31:58,317 --> 01:32:01,446
Oh, they're better.
They're getting better.

1263
01:32:01,529 --> 01:32:04,624
You see?
Profound satisfaction.

1264
01:32:04,699 --> 01:32:08,704
Such is the inevitable result of a
prolonged stay at the Marigold Hotel.

1265
01:32:08,828 --> 01:32:11,297
What are those men doing?
Working for me, Mr. Maruthi.

1266
01:32:11,372 --> 01:32:14,592
To create a home for the
elderly so wonderful...

1267
01:32:14,667 --> 01:32:17,261
that they will simply
refuse to die.

1268
01:32:17,336 --> 01:32:19,464
Stare death in the face
and say-

1269
01:32:19,588 --> 01:32:22,808
What are those men doing?

1270
01:32:25,803 --> 01:32:27,680
Mummyji, what is going on here?

1271
01:32:27,805 --> 01:32:31,355
Sonny, I have spoken to your brothers.
They have decided to sell the hotel.

1272
01:32:31,434 --> 01:32:33,812
These men are here to value the building.
[Speaks Hindi]

1273
01:32:33,894 --> 01:32:36,488
They are valuing the land.
My brothers don't care about the building.

1274
01:32:36,605 --> 01:32:39,199
They will knock it down.
Well, they could wait for a month...

1275
01:32:39,275 --> 01:32:41,152
for it to fall down
of its own accord, huh?

1276
01:32:41,277 --> 01:32:44,497
You joke, Mummyji but inside,
I know you're not laughing.

1277
01:32:44,572 --> 01:32:48,122
You don't want to see this dream
destroyed, Send these people away.

1278
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:51,545
No, beta, it's too late.

1279
01:32:51,662 --> 01:32:54,165
Mu mmyji, please, if I
could just show you these figures-

1280
01:32:54,248 --> 01:32:58,469
I don't need to see them. I know they don't add up.

1281
01:32:58,544 --> 01:33:02,390
There is still time to turn things around.
With a small injection of funds, we can-

1282
01:33:02,465 --> 01:33:04,684
Who is going to be trusting
you with this money, huh?

1283
01:33:04,759 --> 01:33:08,730
You, who can't even run a chai stand?
Just like your father.

1284
01:33:08,804 --> 01:33:11,182
Do I remind you
of him so much?

1285
01:33:11,265 --> 01:33:13,984
Is that why
you must be so cruel to me?

1286
01:33:14,060 --> 01:33:15,983
You think I'm being cruel?

1287
01:33:16,062 --> 01:33:18,485
You loved my father,
and he loved this hotel.

1288
01:33:18,564 --> 01:33:21,909
You want to end up
a broken man like him?

1289
01:33:21,984 --> 01:33:25,488
Just say good-bye to all this
and come back to Delhi with me.

1290
01:33:25,571 --> 01:33:27,824
Your life will be much easier.

1291
01:33:27,907 --> 01:33:32,037
No. Not easier, Mummyji.
Smaller.

1292
01:33:40,336 --> 01:33:43,681
Mrs. Donnelly.
Uh, can I help you?

1293
01:33:43,756 --> 01:33:48,853
It depends.
Do you know how to work a computer?

1294
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:53,434
Mrs. Ainslie said she knew an address
where I could get some things I need.

1295
01:33:53,516 --> 01:33:57,942
Some biscuits.
She said I could get them on the line?

1296
01:33:58,020 --> 01:34:00,864
Well, I wish you luck.

1297
01:34:32,972 --> 01:34:36,146
The whole thing is actually
tremendously exciting.

1298
01:34:36,225 --> 01:34:40,025
Not just getting on the plane, but
getting on the plane and turning left.

1299
01:34:41,730 --> 01:34:43,152
Turning left?

1300
01:34:43,232 --> 01:34:45,360
First class.

1301
01:34:45,442 --> 01:34:49,663
And home in time for our
40th wedding anniversary.

1302
01:34:49,738 --> 01:34:53,288
We haven't quite decided
how to mark the occasion.

1303
01:34:53,367 --> 01:34:55,916
Perhaps a minute of silence.

1304
01:35:16,724 --> 01:35:19,603
Yes. Okay. Okay, sir.

1305
01:35:19,727 --> 01:35:23,482
I've confirmed your appointment for
tomorrow morning at 10:00. Thank you.

1306
01:35:24,607 --> 01:35:27,235
Now, Mr. Maruthi-
Mrs. Donnelly, please.

1307
01:35:27,318 --> 01:35:29,616
Call me Bhanuprakash.

1308
01:35:33,115 --> 01:35:36,619
Too small.
One large should Ht us all, I think.

1309
01:35:42,708 --> 01:35:44,802
Actually,
I think I'll walk.

1310
01:35:44,877 --> 01:35:47,630
Apparently, they're getting
ready for some festival.

1311
01:35:47,713 --> 01:35:50,842
Perhaps y-you'd like one of us
to accompany you?

1312
01:35:50,925 --> 01:35:54,555
- I'm happy to walk with you.
- No, no, no, I'm fine.

1313
01:35:54,678 --> 01:35:58,308
I'm so pleased about your daughter's success
and that it's all worked out so well.

1314
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:00,817
Thank you.

1315
01:36:16,867 --> 01:36:19,461
Darling? Darling.

1316
01:36:19,536 --> 01:36:21,959
It's me.

1317
01:36:22,039 --> 01:36:24,292
I just wanted
to hear your voice.

1318
01:36:26,919 --> 01:36:30,469
Oh, no. No, sorry.
I didn't even think about the time.

1319
01:36:30,547 --> 01:36:34,802
How are you?
And Polly and the- How are the boys?

1320
01:36:36,011 --> 01:36:40,232
Oh. Good. Good.
I'm glad you've been reading it.

1321
01:36:40,307 --> 01:36:44,187
Yes. Yes, I made
a few very good friends.

1322
01:36:46,188 --> 01:36:49,943
No, I'm fine.
Of course I am. I'm fine.

1323
01:36:50,025 --> 01:36:51,698
Time's up
in there, madam.

1324
01:36:51,777 --> 01:36:54,530
Um, I think the money's
running out.

1325
01:36:54,613 --> 01:36:57,457
So I'll call you again,
um, at another time.

1326
01:36:58,826 --> 01:37:03,127
Okay, Bye, darling.
I'll call you again soon. Bye.

1327
01:37:12,047 --> 01:37:13,799
Sonny.

1328
01:37:13,882 --> 01:37:15,555
Sonny!

1329
01:37:16,969 --> 01:37:18,846
Mrs. Greenslade,
where are the others?

1330
01:37:18,929 --> 01:37:22,308
They're on their way back to the hotel.
What's the matter?

1331
01:37:22,433 --> 01:37:26,734
I-I wanted to warn you of the most
momentous changes that are occurring.

1332
01:37:26,812 --> 01:37:29,315
Absolutely all of them, without
question, for the very positive.

1333
01:37:29,398 --> 01:37:31,901
What are you talking about?

1334
01:37:31,984 --> 01:37:35,909
I am delighted to announce the closing
of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.

1335
01:37:35,988 --> 01:37:40,038
And the joyful return of all its
inhabitants to their home country.

1336
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:42,833
What?

1337
01:37:42,911 --> 01:37:45,414
Please relax in the knowledge
that your journey home...

1338
01:37:45,497 --> 01:37:47,625
has been arranged
and paid for by the hotel.

1339
01:37:47,708 --> 01:37:51,133
Our journey here was arranged and paid
for by the hotel and look how that went.

1340
01:37:51,211 --> 01:37:53,305
I'd rather
walk back to England.

1341
01:37:53,380 --> 01:37:55,929
I'd rather
not go back at all.

1342
01:37:56,008 --> 01:37:58,227
Go back where?

1343
01:37:58,302 --> 01:38:00,225
And for myself,
the news is even better.

1344
01:38:00,304 --> 01:38:02,432
I shall be moving to Delhi
to live with my mother.

1345
01:38:02,514 --> 01:38:05,518
And, furthermore, I shall be wed to a
most suitable person of her choice,

1346
01:38:05,642 --> 01:38:08,987
whom I look forward very much to meeting
before I spend the rest of my life with her.

1347
01:38:10,481 --> 01:38:14,111
Didn't you have a girlfriend?
She is my girlfriend no longer.

1348
01:38:14,193 --> 01:38:16,742
This is a disaster.

1349
01:38:16,820 --> 01:38:21,246
No, no. Then we must treat it just the
same as we would treat a triumph, madam.

1350
01:38:21,325 --> 01:38:23,544
Is that not what
your Mr. Kipling tells us?

1351
01:38:23,619 --> 01:38:25,587
Although, of course,
here we have a problem,

1352
01:38:25,662 --> 01:38:29,462
because I, Sunil lndrajit Kapoor,
have never had a triumph.

1353
01:38:29,541 --> 01:38:31,543
So, of course,
I do not know how to treat one.

1354
01:38:31,627 --> 01:38:34,301
No, all I've had is a constant
series of disasters...

1355
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:38,135
interspersed with occasional catastrophe,
an unending stream of total-

1356
01:38:38,217 --> 01:38:41,437
Sonny, do you love her?
Sunaina?

1357
01:38:41,553 --> 01:38:44,557
Most deeply.
Have you told her you love her?

1358
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:47,860
It is because I love her
that I must not tell her.

1359
01:38:47,935 --> 01:38:50,233
She can do so much better
than me, madam.

1360
01:38:50,312 --> 01:38:53,236
Women love it when you say that kind of thing.
It's a powerful aphrodisiac.

1361
01:38:53,357 --> 01:38:56,110
Really?
No, of course not.

1362
01:38:56,235 --> 01:39:00,206
Go and ind her at once, before she starts
to believe you and you lose her forever.

1363
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:02,624
You can have
anything you want, Sonny.

1364
01:39:02,699 --> 01:39:05,623
You just need to stop waiting for
someone to tell you you deserve it.

1365
01:39:05,744 --> 01:39:08,623
My God. Or you can just go on
failing yourself and hurting-

1366
01:39:08,705 --> 01:39:10,958
Mrs. Greenslade, stop drilling.

1367
01:39:12,251 --> 01:39:14,345
You have struck oil,
madam!

1368
01:39:22,136 --> 01:39:24,810
I asked him
to come and stay with me.

1369
01:39:24,888 --> 01:39:28,062
Is that wise?
I'm not sure he's trained.

1370
01:39:28,142 --> 01:39:31,112
You think it's too soon.

1371
01:39:31,228 --> 01:39:34,402
It doesn't matter what I think.
It is too soon.

1372
01:39:34,481 --> 01:39:37,360
At our age, we can't afford
the luxury of taking it slow,

1373
01:39:37,443 --> 01:39:41,368
and it's either this
or he goes home and-

1374
01:39:41,447 --> 01:39:43,245
I wish you both
the very best.

1375
01:39:43,365 --> 01:39:47,336
You haven't met anyone?
Single by choice.

1376
01:39:47,411 --> 01:39:49,505
Just not my choice.

1377
01:39:50,789 --> 01:39:53,463
I actually think
it might be over.

1378
01:39:53,542 --> 01:39:56,716
For me.
With men.

1379
01:39:56,795 --> 01:39:58,718
And if that's gone,

1380
01:40:00,090 --> 01:40:01,967
I'm not quite sure
what's left.

1381
01:40:02,050 --> 01:40:06,396
Did you know Norman brought pills
the first night he stayed with me?

1382
01:40:06,472 --> 01:40:08,566
It obviously
did the trick.

1383
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:11,610
They fell out of his pocket, and I
didn't want it to be like that.

1384
01:40:11,685 --> 01:40:16,486
So I swapped them.
He went all night on two aspirin.

1385
01:40:19,359 --> 01:40:21,908
it's never over.

1386
01:40:25,532 --> 01:40:29,287
Can you make sure that small
bag goes in the back with me?

1387
01:40:29,369 --> 01:40:32,498
In the back, yes? In the back.
Do you understand?

1388
01:40:32,581 --> 01:40:33,582
Excuse me.

1389
01:40:36,877 --> 01:40:39,630
Would you rather
not see him?

1390
01:40:45,093 --> 01:40:47,391
My wallet.
I-I've forgotten my wallet.

1391
01:40:47,471 --> 01:40:50,099
I'm so- I'm so sorry.
I won't- I won't be a minute.

1392
01:40:58,440 --> 01:41:00,534
She's not back yet.

1393
01:41:02,653 --> 01:41:03,870
Ah.

1394
01:41:06,198 --> 01:41:08,576
Right.

1395
01:41:08,659 --> 01:41:13,165
Well, then perhaps you could
tell her that I said,

1396
01:41:13,247 --> 01:41:16,296
um, good-bye.

1397
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:33,146
False alarm. I, uh-
I had it all the time.

1398
01:41:33,267 --> 01:41:35,440
Let's go.

1399
01:41:45,571 --> 01:41:49,701
While I have you on the phone, madam, can
I talk to you about our special offers?

1400
01:41:49,783 --> 01:41:52,332
This is a particularly good time to
be thinking of taking advantage...

1401
01:41:52,411 --> 01:41:55,255
of our new and improved system.

1402
01:42:05,507 --> 01:42:07,225
Sunaina!

1403
01:42:08,302 --> 01:42:11,681
Sunaina!

1404
01:42:15,684 --> 01:42:17,903
Sunaina!

1405
01:42:17,978 --> 01:42:20,026
I Jay I
Hey, what's going on?

1406
01:42:21,189 --> 01:42:22,862
Sonny?

1407
01:42:25,235 --> 01:42:28,489
I need to see Sunaina.

1408
01:42:28,572 --> 01:42:31,951
Her shift's not over.
And when it is, she doesn't want to see you.

1409
01:42:32,034 --> 01:42:34,253
Jay.

1410
01:42:34,328 --> 01:42:39,004
You- You are the son my
mother wished I was.

1411
01:42:39,082 --> 01:42:42,757
An intelligent man with a
strong head for business.

1412
01:42:42,836 --> 01:42:46,807
You see things as they are and
not as you wish them to be.

1413
01:42:46,882 --> 01:42:49,510
So fuck off out of my way!

1414
01:42:49,593 --> 01:42:52,062
Or you can give her
a message.

1415
01:42:52,137 --> 01:42:55,641
Tell her from me what I should
have told her the day we met.

1416
01:42:55,724 --> 01:42:59,649
What I will announce to anyone
who asks and many who do not.

1417
01:42:59,728 --> 01:43:02,072
- Including your mother?
- I Jay] Including my mother?

1418
01:43:02,147 --> 01:43:04,241
- His mother.
- Your mother.

1419
01:43:04,316 --> 01:43:07,160
I will tell every mother
in the land.

1420
01:43:07,277 --> 01:43:09,450
What will you tell them?
What will you tell them?

1421
01:43:11,198 --> 01:43:13,576
The only thing that matters
in this world.

1422
01:43:13,659 --> 01:43:16,959
That I love you
and always will.

1423
01:43:17,037 --> 01:43:19,415
And by you I mean Sunaina,
Jay, not you.

1424
01:43:19,498 --> 01:43:23,253
Although if you are to be my brother-in-law,
I hope we can become better friends.

1425
01:43:25,087 --> 01:43:27,215
Why is he only
saying this now?

1426
01:43:28,882 --> 01:43:31,010
You ask him.

1427
01:43:37,974 --> 01:43:40,397
Why are you only
saying this now?

1428
01:43:40,477 --> 01:43:42,354
Because, Sunaina,

1429
01:43:42,437 --> 01:43:47,113
love of my life, no more will I
believe that I'm not worthy.

1430
01:43:47,192 --> 01:43:52,164
For only by loving you as you
deserve will I become so.

1431
01:44:24,646 --> 01:44:28,651
it's funny. They call this rush hour,
and yet nothing actually moves.

1432
01:44:31,194 --> 01:44:34,664
Well, it's not
that... funny.

1433
01:44:43,623 --> 01:44:46,593
Where do you think you're going?
You may well ask.

1434
01:44:46,668 --> 01:44:48,762
We're moving in
together, Mrs. D.

1435
01:44:48,837 --> 01:44:51,636
- Already?
- That point's been made.

1436
01:44:51,715 --> 01:44:54,013
The hotel is closing,
Mrs. Donnelly.

1437
01:44:55,802 --> 01:44:57,679
It doesn't have to.

1438
01:45:01,475 --> 01:45:04,069
I've been going over
the accounts.

1439
01:45:10,192 --> 01:45:11,865
May I?

1440
01:45:22,037 --> 01:45:23,755
Mummyji.

1441
01:45:23,830 --> 01:45:26,800
Mummyji, do you remember
what my father used to say?

1442
01:45:26,875 --> 01:45:29,799
That nothing happens
unless first we dream.

1443
01:45:29,878 --> 01:45:33,678
And I have dreamt, Mummyji,
and like him, I have failed.

1444
01:45:33,757 --> 01:45:38,183
The Marigold Hotel is crumbling to dust,
and it turns out I can live with that.

1445
01:45:38,261 --> 01:45:41,765
But the one thing I will not do
is live without this girl.

1446
01:45:43,308 --> 01:45:46,027
This is Sunaina
Shantanu Palawar.

1447
01:45:46,937 --> 01:45:49,656
The woman I love
and wish to marry.

1448
01:45:49,731 --> 01:45:52,234
I'm very pleased to meet you, Mrs.
Kapoor.

1449
01:45:54,736 --> 01:45:57,239
No, Sonny. I forbid it.

1450
01:45:57,322 --> 01:45:59,370
I forbid this match.

1451
01:45:59,449 --> 01:46:01,827
Utterly and completely.
Do you hear me?

1452
01:46:01,910 --> 01:46:04,789
This can't happen.

1453
01:46:17,551 --> 01:46:19,349
What is he saying?

1454
01:46:19,427 --> 01:46:21,179
Um-

1455
01:46:24,349 --> 01:46:27,523
He says that he's been with this
family for as long as he can remember.

1456
01:46:31,940 --> 01:46:34,284
And that he remembers
another tight.

1457
01:46:34,359 --> 01:46:37,203
Between two young people
and their parents.

1458
01:46:44,160 --> 01:46:46,504
And he remembers the moment
when the young man...

1459
01:46:46,621 --> 01:46:50,797
stood up to his mother
and said- And said...

1460
01:46:50,876 --> 01:46:54,096
Yes, I want to marry
this woman.

1461
01:46:54,170 --> 01:46:57,765
Yes, she comes from
a different community,

1462
01:46:57,841 --> 01:47:00,936
but she's smart
and she's beautiful,

1463
01:47:02,304 --> 01:47:03,977
and I love her.

1464
01:47:09,102 --> 01:47:12,151
I don't know
who he's talking about.

1465
01:47:17,277 --> 01:47:20,998
Sunaina, I may have
no right to judge,

1466
01:47:21,072 --> 01:47:24,121
but I have a mother's right
to worry,

1467
01:47:25,535 --> 01:47:28,163
Take care of my favorite son.

1468
01:47:33,460 --> 01:47:37,215
Sorry. I'm not clear now.
Am I staying or going?

1469
01:47:37,297 --> 01:47:40,267
- Well, it depends how you read the accounts.
- The accounts?

1470
01:47:40,342 --> 01:47:43,642
It turns out the original plan
for the hotel is good.

1471
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:47,224
It works.
Just not in the hands of a lunatic.

1472
01:47:47,307 --> 01:47:49,480
I knew that plan was good.

1473
01:47:49,559 --> 01:47:52,028
What the place needs
is money.

1474
01:47:52,103 --> 01:47:56,449
And guests, starting with the
ones that are already here.

1475
01:47:56,524 --> 01:47:59,027
Unfortunately, my investor, Mr.
Maruthi, has decided that,

1476
01:47:59,110 --> 01:48:01,454
while he greatly admires
my endeavors-

1477
01:48:02,906 --> 01:48:05,830
- He's reconsidered.
- You spoke to him?

1478
01:48:05,909 --> 01:48:09,129
So long as there's somebody
sane to help the manager.

1479
01:48:09,204 --> 01:48:11,457
No. The manager
needs no help, madam.

1480
01:48:11,539 --> 01:48:12,711
Sonny.

1481
01:48:13,291 --> 01:48:14,793
Hmm.

1482
01:48:14,876 --> 01:48:19,006
- The manager needs a little help.
- So will you stay?

1483
01:48:19,089 --> 01:48:21,842
- I'd like to.
- In the shack on the roof?

1484
01:48:22,676 --> 01:48:25,225
We have a- a double room,

1485
01:48:25,303 --> 01:48:28,022
bathroom en suite,
and a fully working door.

1486
01:48:28,098 --> 01:48:32,274
Mr. Dashwood, as you
know, has recently checked out.

1487
01:48:32,352 --> 01:48:34,901
Oh.

1488
01:48:37,607 --> 01:48:40,281
Mrs. Hardcastle,
you'll stay.

1489
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:43,864
- On my own?
- I know you're off your game, dear.

1490
01:48:43,947 --> 01:48:46,541
Lost your confidence maybe.

1491
01:48:46,616 --> 01:48:51,372
But, you know, you are a thoroughbred.
You'll be back.

1492
01:48:53,498 --> 01:48:56,251
What about you,
Mrs. Greenslade?

1493
01:48:56,334 --> 01:48:58,007
What about me,
Mrs. Donnelly?

1494
01:48:58,086 --> 01:49:00,714
We haven't talked much,
have we? You and I.

1495
01:49:01,589 --> 01:49:03,683
My loss, evidently.

1496
01:49:04,551 --> 01:49:06,645
Will you stay?

1497
01:49:08,013 --> 01:49:10,107
I'm not sure
what I shall do.

1498
01:49:12,976 --> 01:49:17,152
Nothing here has worked out
quite as I expected.

1499
01:49:17,230 --> 01:49:19,278
Most things don't.

1500
01:49:19,399 --> 01:49:24,576
But, you know, sometimes what
happens instead is the good stuff.

1501
01:49:25,864 --> 01:49:28,287
Don't you have work
to go to in the morning?

1502
01:49:30,368 --> 01:49:32,086
Yes.

1503
01:49:33,329 --> 01:49:37,300
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1504
01:49:40,295 --> 01:49:44,971
If I can stand on my own two
feet, I'm sure you can too.

1505
01:49:46,593 --> 01:49:49,267
Who's the new
assistant manager?

1506
01:49:49,345 --> 01:49:52,019
Mr. Maruthi had me in mind.

1507
01:49:52,098 --> 01:49:54,897
You thinking of applying
for the job?

1508
01:49:58,021 --> 01:50:00,399
Oh, chair, please.

1509
01:50:07,530 --> 01:50:10,204
That's quite enough exercise
for one day.

1510
01:50:10,784 --> 01:50:12,457
Office.

1511
01:50:13,536 --> 01:50:15,209
Oh, steady.

1512
01:50:16,164 --> 01:50:18,417
Oh!

1513
01:50:35,183 --> 01:50:37,811
This is absolutely ridiculous.

1514
01:50:37,894 --> 01:50:42,024
We could be here for hours.
There's no way we'll get out of here.

1515
01:50:42,107 --> 01:50:44,201
- Well, maybe there is.
- You!

1516
01:50:45,485 --> 01:50:47,658
Can you get us
to the airport?

1517
01:50:47,737 --> 01:50:50,365
Sorry. Long way.
Sore legs, Not possible.

1518
01:50:50,448 --> 01:50:52,542
I'll give you
everything I have.

1519
01:50:53,493 --> 01:50:55,837
Okay, step right in,
let's go.

1520
01:50:55,912 --> 01:50:58,131
Can you get our cases out,
please?

1521
01:50:58,206 --> 01:51:00,675
Come on, Douglas.
Come on, Douglas, come on.

1522
01:51:00,750 --> 01:51:03,845
- Sorry, no manage people and cases.
- What?

1523
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:07,595
It's not possible, madam.
Two persons, no cases. One person and cases.

1524
01:51:07,674 --> 01:51:11,770
Well, how about if I give you something else?
I'll give you my watch.

1525
01:51:11,845 --> 01:51:15,145
Sure. Thanks.
But still it's not possible, madam.

1526
01:51:15,223 --> 01:51:18,022
We'll get another flight. Let's go back
to the hotel and leave in the morning.

1527
01:51:18,143 --> 01:51:20,817
No. Jean, he can't do it.
You heard what he said.

1528
01:51:20,895 --> 01:51:23,523
- He can do one person and cases.
- Yeah, but-

1529
01:51:23,606 --> 01:51:27,201
Could fate ind a better way to
tell us what we need to hear?

1530
01:51:28,486 --> 01:51:32,116
- Which is what?
- That it's over.

1531
01:51:32,198 --> 01:51:34,451
That it's been over
for a long, long time.

1532
01:51:34,534 --> 01:51:37,504
This is not the time to talk about
this, Let's wait until we get home.

1533
01:51:37,579 --> 01:51:39,832
I have to go, Douglas.

1534
01:51:41,624 --> 01:51:42,750
I won't let you.

1535
01:51:42,834 --> 01:51:46,930
No. You'll come after me.

1536
01:51:47,005 --> 01:51:50,726
You'll chase me to the airport,
tell me everything will be fine.

1537
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:52,473
But please don't.

1538
01:51:53,636 --> 01:51:55,889
Because the truth is-

1539
01:51:55,972 --> 01:51:58,896
The truth is we both deserve
more than we've had.

1540
01:52:00,685 --> 01:52:03,689
And it's just because
of your...

1541
01:52:03,771 --> 01:52:05,865
kindness and your-

1542
01:52:07,567 --> 01:52:11,913
your loyalty
that you won't admit it.

1543
01:52:17,869 --> 01:52:19,963
I'll be all right.

1544
01:52:23,333 --> 01:52:25,461
I'm turning left.

1545
01:52:30,256 --> 01:52:32,099
Good-bye, Douglas.

1546
01:52:47,148 --> 01:52:48,821
Day 51.

1547
01:52:52,904 --> 01:52:57,205
The only real failure
is the failure to try.

1548
01:52:59,035 --> 01:53:03,165
And the measure of success is how
we cope with disappointment,

1549
01:53:04,791 --> 01:53:06,668
As we always must

1550
01:53:10,797 --> 01:53:14,017
We came here and we Med

1551
01:53:14,092 --> 01:53:16,936
All of us our different ways.

1552
01:53:21,140 --> 01:53:25,316
Can we be blamed for feeling
that we are too old to change?

1553
01:53:28,690 --> 01:53:31,990
Too scared of disappointment
to start it alll again?

1554
01:53:36,322 --> 01:53:38,416
We get up 177 the morning.

1555
01:53:39,534 --> 01:53:41,628
We do our best

1556
01:53:43,997 --> 01:53:46,091
Nothing else matters.

1557
01:54:13,151 --> 01:54:16,371
You're still here.
I-I-I missed the plane.

1558
01:54:17,655 --> 01:54:20,909
What about Jean?
She didn't.

1559
01:54:23,828 --> 01:54:27,082
I had- I had quite an
interesting night actually.

1560
01:54:27,165 --> 01:54:29,839
I-I met the same, um,
taxi driver,

1561
01:54:29,917 --> 01:54:33,046
but this time I let him take
me to his brother's hotel.

1562
01:54:33,129 --> 01:54:36,633
Wh-Which turned out to be less
of a hotel and more of a-

1563
01:54:38,009 --> 01:54:41,138
more of a brothel really.

1564
01:54:41,220 --> 01:54:44,850
And they- And they gave me this
pipe, said it was apple tobacco.

1565
01:54:44,932 --> 01:54:48,857
But that's not what they called
it when I was a student.

1566
01:54:48,936 --> 01:54:51,860
So-So I made my excuses
and left.

1567
01:54:51,939 --> 01:54:55,569
Uh, I need-
I needed time to... think.

1568
01:54:58,780 --> 01:55:02,455
This city at night
is extraordinary.

1569
01:55:04,660 --> 01:55:07,914
I think the apple tobacco
helped probably,

1570
01:55:08,039 --> 01:55:10,588
I'm going to be late for work.
Right.

1571
01:55:12,752 --> 01:55:14,299
Um-

1572
01:55:15,546 --> 01:55:19,096
What time do you finish?
I get back about 5:00.

1573
01:55:20,468 --> 01:55:22,562
Teatime.
Yes.

1574
01:55:22,678 --> 01:55:26,649
How do you take it?
With a little milk.

1575
01:55:26,724 --> 01:55:28,397
All right.

1576
01:55:49,372 --> 01:55:53,377
But its also true
that the person who risks nothing...

1577
01:55:53,459 --> 01:55:57,339
does nothing, has nothing.

1578
01:56:01,175 --> 01:56:05,521
All we know about the future
is that it will be diferent.

1579
01:56:05,596 --> 01:56:07,724
Just your signature, please.

1580
01:56:10,685 --> 01:56:13,279
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

1581
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:16,654
Welcome. Please.

1582
01:56:19,026 --> 01:56:21,825
This is a building
of the utmost character.

1583
01:56:21,904 --> 01:56:26,660
But perhaps what
we fear is that it will be the same.

1584
01:56:30,037 --> 01:56:32,881
So we must celebrate
the changes.

1585
01:56:32,957 --> 01:56:34,504
Thank you.

1586
01:56:36,127 --> 01:56:40,553
Because, as someone once said everything
will be all right in the end.

1587
01:56:41,757 --> 01:56:46,433
And if it's not all right,
then trust me-

1588
01:56:49,348 --> 01:56:51,567
It's not yet the end.
