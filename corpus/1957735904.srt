1
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:07,623
Rrow.

2
00:02:09,447 --> 00:02:10,201
Uh... honey?

3
00:02:10,215 --> 00:02:11,930
I don't think that’s gonna fit.

4
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:14,155
Just a little more dear.

5
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,466
Got it!

6
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:19,242
See hon, I told you
I could do it.

7
00:02:26,774 --> 00:02:28,430
♥ Dee Dee. ♥

8
00:03:01,338 --> 00:03:02,418
Yes.

9
00:03:03,055 --> 00:03:03,912
Yes.

10
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:06,975
With this all powering Neurotomic
Protocore in my possession,

11
00:03:07,044 --> 00:03:08,662
I will make the world mine!

12
00:03:08,665 --> 00:03:09,372
Haa haa haa!

13
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,288
Haa haa haa haa haa!

14
00:03:10,298 --> 00:03:11,291
Haa haa haa haa!

15
00:03:11,294 --> 00:03:11,985
Haa haa!

16
00:03:12,022 --> 00:03:15,584
Unhand that Neurotomic
Protocore Mandark!

17
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:17,958
Who said that?

18
00:03:18,186 --> 00:03:19,326
I did!

19
00:03:25,752 --> 00:03:28,197
Dexter!

20
00:03:28,972 --> 00:03:30,743
Blast you Dexter!

21
00:03:30,831 --> 00:03:32,226
Hay, now’s there's an idea.

22
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:33,912
Blast Dexter. Yes.

23
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:36,049
Blast Dexter!

24
00:03:47,387 --> 00:03:49,659
Ooooh.

25
00:03:49,718 --> 00:03:52,246
Know this Mandark,

26
00:03:52,293 --> 00:03:54,407
that as long as I live

27
00:03:54,511 --> 00:03:58,424
you will never possess
the Neurotomic Protocore.

28
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,481
I swear it.

29
00:04:06,402 --> 00:04:08,747
And I swear Dexter
for as long as I shall live,

30
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,094
I will one day possess the Neurotomic
Protocore and rule the world.

31
00:04:12,405 --> 00:04:13,620
I swear it.

32
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:17,551
Whew!

33
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:19,434
Now that that is taken care of

34
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,160
I can get back to work.

35
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:39,606
Have your gibberish woman.

36
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,294
I have no time for you today.

37
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:44,368
Much too much has happened.
So I bid you adieu.

38
00:04:44,655 --> 00:04:46,240
Goodbye sister.

39
00:04:47,728 --> 00:04:50,513
You know the exit
is this way, goodbye.

40
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:29,261
Dee Dee, how many times do I have to tell
you to stay out of my laborrr...

41
00:05:29,657 --> 00:05:31,317
You're not Dee Dee.

42
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,316
W-w-w-who are you?

43
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,785
We are here to destroy
the one who saved the future.

44
00:05:56,291 --> 00:06:02,967
Ahhhhhoo ahh
ahh ahh ooh aah.... ...!

45
00:06:03,485 --> 00:06:04,732
Enough!

46
00:06:04,872 --> 00:06:08,391
No robots are going
to threaten me in my lab.

47
00:06:08,427 --> 00:06:11,178
Even
if they are from the future.

48
00:06:11,269 --> 00:06:17,795
Futuristic robots prepared
to meet your maker!

49
00:06:25,002 --> 00:06:27,952
Ahhhh!

50
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:35,748
Well, that was easy.

51
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:42,504
No dumb robots from the future
can destroy this little genius.

52
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,313
But boy oh boy.

53
00:07:45,316 --> 00:07:49,789
I must be something else for somebody
to go through all this trouble.

54
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,261
Boy oh boy.

55
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:58,368
Dexter, the boy
who saved the future.

56
00:07:58,404 --> 00:07:59,139
Woo!

57
00:07:59,276 --> 00:08:02,068
I can't wait for the future.

58
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,690
Pft. The future
is taking too long.

59
00:08:06,735 --> 00:08:07,808
Wait a second,

60
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:10,694
I don't have to wait
for the future.

61
00:08:10,743 --> 00:08:14,476
I'll just get into my old
trusty time machine.

62
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:16,912
And zap, boom, pop!

63
00:08:16,972 --> 00:08:19,698
I'll get to see how cool I am.

64
00:08:19,912 --> 00:08:21,683
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

65
00:08:21,686 --> 00:08:22,621
Oh boy!

66
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:25,802
Future, here I come.

67
00:08:43,854 --> 00:08:46,241
This is very peculiar.

68
00:08:46,328 --> 00:08:48,294
The lab seems untouched.

69
00:08:48,448 --> 00:08:51,463
But I have traveled
the years into the future.

70
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,981
Is nothing different?

71
00:08:56,754 --> 00:08:58,768
This is different.

72
00:09:00,642 --> 00:09:02,343
Aliens!

73
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,487
Hey! What are you non-aliens
doing in my laboratory?

74
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:12,187
Your laboratory?

75
00:09:12,234 --> 00:09:13,506
This is our rec room.

76
00:09:13,571 --> 00:09:16,123
Who are you? What are you doing here?
What's your number?

77
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,345
I do not have a number.

78
00:09:18,376 --> 00:09:21,283
I am Dexter the one who saved
the future.

79
00:09:21,469 --> 00:09:23,005
And I live here.

80
00:09:23,477 --> 00:09:25,476
- Yow!
- No number, huh?

81
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,332
Come with me.

82
00:09:26,454 --> 00:09:29,908
It is a sad sad world when
the no numbers can just waltz

83
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:33,573
on in onto private property
with no trouble at all.

84
00:09:33,576 --> 00:09:35,947
I hope you like jail
Mr. No Number.

85
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:37,867
Officer 9-4-1-2 here.

86
00:09:37,893 --> 00:09:39,214
How can I be of assistance?

87
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,223
I have here, a no number!

88
00:09:41,645 --> 00:09:42,629
Were on our way.

89
00:09:44,828 --> 00:09:46,280
Let's get him boys.

90
00:09:50,693 --> 00:09:51,840
Aye!

91
00:09:57,977 --> 00:09:59,183
Pffffffft.

92
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:04,607
Dexter boy, sometimes
this is just too easy.

93
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:08,868
Closet!?! This is supposed
to be the front door.

94
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,339
Stop where you are and put
your hands in the air!

95
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:16,828
Where is the front door?!?

96
00:10:17,136 --> 00:10:19,035
Where is the front door?

97
00:10:19,834 --> 00:10:24,401
Wait, I wonder if my old emergency
exit route is still here.

98
00:10:29,108 --> 00:10:29,959
Where'd he go?

99
00:10:30,152 --> 00:10:31,937
He's nowhere to be found.

100
00:10:35,585 --> 00:10:38,393
I guess I don't live
here in the future.

101
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:42,231
My folks must have moved out when
the neighborhood started growing.

102
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:47,475
Boy, what cool cars.

103
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,391
Wow.

104
00:10:54,049 --> 00:10:55,635
Would ya' look at that.

105
00:10:56,009 --> 00:10:57,769
The future.

106
00:11:02,283 --> 00:11:05,512
Clearly these achievements
must be my own.

107
00:11:10,553 --> 00:11:13,360
Unauthorized walking.
Identify yourself.

108
00:11:13,403 --> 00:11:16,178
Dexter, boy genius.

109
00:11:17,438 --> 00:11:18,660
State your number.

110
00:11:18,703 --> 00:11:21,024
I have been told
I have no number.

111
00:11:21,207 --> 00:11:22,470
Retinal scan.

112
00:11:26,913 --> 00:11:29,275
Number 12. Why are you
not at your workstation?

113
00:11:29,372 --> 00:11:32,758
Workstation! I don't
work, I'm a boy.

114
00:11:32,838 --> 00:11:34,357
Must return to work station.

115
00:11:34,396 --> 00:11:38,508
How can I return to a workstation
I have never even been too?

116
00:11:38,711 --> 00:11:40,255
That is right.

117
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,175
My future self.

118
00:11:42,553 --> 00:11:44,998
Well Mr. Robot,

119
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:49,075
it looks like 'duh' you are taking
me exactly where I want to go.

120
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,365
To the heart of the city robot.

121
00:11:51,432 --> 00:11:55,032
Where my laboratory
in the sky awaits.

122
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,477
I love the future!

123
00:12:17,936 --> 00:12:19,935
Mmm, breakfast..

124
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:27,881
8:52, Holy cow, I'm almost late.

125
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:29,857
I better log on.

126
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,235
Good morning number
12, welcome to work.

127
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:34,559
Aw, just made it.

128
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:38,910
Wow, I could have
been in big big trouble.

129
00:12:40,963 --> 00:12:42,037
Number 12?

130
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,222
Y-y-yes sir?

131
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,463
You are almost
late this morning.

132
00:12:46,602 --> 00:12:48,121
But but but but but but.

133
00:12:48,124 --> 00:12:49,617
Report to my office immediately.

134
00:13:13,198 --> 00:13:14,512
You're expected.

135
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,224
You!

136
00:13:43,602 --> 00:13:45,576
Almost late for work again.

137
00:13:45,622 --> 00:13:46,919
Tisk tisk tisk.

138
00:13:46,997 --> 00:13:48,327
Such a pity.

139
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,498
There are two types of people
in this world number 12,

140
00:13:53,604 --> 00:13:56,008
there are those who struggle
to support their families.

141
00:13:56,273 --> 00:13:58,940
Scratching and scraping.

142
00:13:58,946 --> 00:14:00,680
For any little morsel
of food… oh!

143
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:01,967
They can find.

144
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:06,392
And there's the strong
and powerful the elite.

145
00:14:06,732 --> 00:14:09,342
With luxuries that others
can't possibly dream of.

146
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,838
Would you number 12…

147
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:15,850
are neither.

148
00:14:19,006 --> 00:14:24,432
Ha haha ha hahahaha hahahaha
ha haha hahahaha haha ha!

149
00:14:28,985 --> 00:14:32,561
Hey, hey, hey. What you
think you're are doing?

150
00:14:32,585 --> 00:14:35,881
This is not my laboratory
in the sky!

151
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:40,167
Mandark!

152
00:14:40,408 --> 00:14:43,125
Ladies and gentlemen please
excuse the interruption.

153
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,279
I invite you to join me in the public
floggings of a number 12,

154
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:48,457
for once again he was almost
late for work.

155
00:14:48,793 --> 00:14:51,460
And so number 12
before we get started,

156
00:14:51,527 --> 00:14:53,195
do you have anything
to say for yourself?

157
00:14:53,222 --> 00:14:55,353
Could I have some padding?

158
00:14:55,358 --> 00:14:56,250
No.

159
00:14:59,635 --> 00:15:01,089
Now make a wish.

160
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,345
Ahhh!

161
00:15:04,348 --> 00:15:05,783
Number 12?

162
00:15:05,974 --> 00:15:06,841
Again!

163
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:09,497
Ohhh!

164
00:15:10,484 --> 00:15:12,160
Number 12?

165
00:15:12,219 --> 00:15:13,102
Again!

166
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,900
Ahhh!

167
00:15:16,506 --> 00:15:18,604
N-n-n-number 12?

168
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:29,124
That's me?

169
00:15:30,906 --> 00:15:33,781
This time has been duly noted
and will be deducted from your salary.

170
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,493
Thank you.

171
00:15:41,918 --> 00:15:44,024
- Ahhh!
- Ahhh!

172
00:15:45,931 --> 00:15:47,400
You!

173
00:15:48,707 --> 00:15:50,104
You.

174
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,728
Ohhh!

175
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:54,811
No, no please don't hurt me.

176
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,908
I traveled to the future
for this?

177
00:16:00,033 --> 00:16:02,544
I don't hear any typing
down their number 12.

178
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:05,467
Quick, get out of the chair,
I have to get back on schedule.

179
00:16:05,534 --> 00:16:10,432
Man, how do you let that doofus
Mandark push you around?

180
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:13,379
I don't know what you're
talking about.

181
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:14,731
Please leave.

182
00:16:16,057 --> 00:16:18,321
Just out of curiosity,

183
00:16:18,331 --> 00:16:20,503
did you become a wimp overnight

184
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:23,053
or was it a gradual process.

185
00:16:23,168 --> 00:16:25,257
Oh I've always been like this.

186
00:16:25,326 --> 00:16:26,441
Wrong!

187
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:30,616
I had yet to be beaten
by that oversize head of a man but.

188
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,781
You! You cower
at the sound of his voice.

189
00:16:34,784 --> 00:16:35,988
Typing!

190
00:16:36,242 --> 00:16:37,382
See!

191
00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:43,370
You have ruined everything
I have worked for, haven't you!

192
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:46,936
I don't know who you
are but please leave.

193
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,487
You don't know who I am?

194
00:16:49,662 --> 00:16:51,586
You don't know who I am!

195
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:55,270
I travel through space
and time to see you

196
00:16:55,273 --> 00:16:59,180
and you can't even recognize
your own flesh and blood!

197
00:16:59,183 --> 00:17:00,185
What?

198
00:17:00,188 --> 00:17:02,823
Yes, I am you.

199
00:17:02,923 --> 00:17:05,756
But it can't be. Can it?

200
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:09,737
Typing.

201
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:13,708
I'm sorry I wish I could
talk but I'm very very busy.

202
00:17:13,889 --> 00:17:16,560
What possibly could you
do here that is more

203
00:17:16,561 --> 00:17:18,638
important than talking
to yourself.

204
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:22,385
I hope you know that what I do
here is very important.

205
00:17:22,414 --> 00:17:25,181
I designed these cubicles.

206
00:17:26,151 --> 00:17:28,155
I cannot believe this.

207
00:17:28,254 --> 00:17:32,000
Robots from the future come
back in time to destroy me

208
00:17:32,029 --> 00:17:35,150
cos' I saved the future
and then I travel in time

209
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,536
to see how cool I am
saving the future

210
00:17:38,537 --> 00:17:40,655
and here I find you.

211
00:17:40,822 --> 00:17:43,787
A pitiful excuse of a Dexter.

212
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,831
The Neurotomic Protocore.

213
00:17:51,013 --> 00:17:53,367
Hello, what are these?

214
00:17:53,796 --> 00:17:56,340
Designs utilizing Neurotomic.

215
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,525
An unlimited power
producing pylon.

216
00:17:59,691 --> 00:18:02,573
Teletronic matter manipulation.

217
00:18:02,672 --> 00:18:06,249
Centralized neurotomic
information distribution.

218
00:18:06,384 --> 00:18:10,051
These ideas are incredible.

219
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,694
No no, those are nothing.

220
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:15,044
You should see the new
cubicle design I did.

221
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,754
10 by 10.

222
00:18:16,898 --> 00:18:20,665
Yes, I increased the cubicle
space by 1 foot.

223
00:18:20,859 --> 00:18:23,006
Are you crazy!

224
00:18:23,023 --> 00:18:26,178
These plans can
revolutionize the future.

225
00:18:26,181 --> 00:18:29,691
You are a real Dexter after all.

226
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:34,023
Stop the typing.
Stop the typing.

227
00:18:34,403 --> 00:18:35,972
Stop the typing!

228
00:18:35,975 --> 00:18:38,626
You are not a worker
drone my friend..

229
00:18:38,629 --> 00:18:40,568
You are not just a number.

230
00:18:40,712 --> 00:18:43,083
You are a genius!

231
00:18:45,012 --> 00:18:47,117
You have got a name.

232
00:18:47,145 --> 00:18:48,422
What is your name?

233
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:49,316
12.

234
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,060
No!

235
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:51,489
What is your name?

236
00:18:51,781 --> 00:18:53,458
T-t-twelve.

237
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,657
No! What…is…your…name?

238
00:18:57,064 --> 00:18:58,575
De-De-De-De...

239
00:18:58,578 --> 00:18:59,655
Yes.

240
00:18:59,658 --> 00:19:00,902
Yes!

241
00:19:01,082 --> 00:19:02,015
De-De-De...

242
00:19:02,117 --> 00:19:03,703
Dexter?

243
00:19:03,722 --> 00:19:04,812
Again.

244
00:19:04,815 --> 00:19:05,796
Dexter?

245
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:07,111
Again!

246
00:19:07,114 --> 00:19:08,303
Dexter!

247
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:12,695
Yes!

248
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:16,640
Dexter is the name
of a lion a tiger a bear!

249
00:19:16,643 --> 00:19:17,738
Oh my!

250
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:21,755
Now let's get the heck into the future
and see how cool we are.

251
00:19:33,556 --> 00:19:34,845
Typing.

252
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:37,149
Number 12!

253
00:19:46,138 --> 00:19:47,109
Hee, hee, hee.

254
00:19:47,175 --> 00:19:48,654
Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee.

255
00:19:48,736 --> 00:19:49,769
Hee, hee, hee.

256
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:51,348
Haha ha!

257
00:19:51,472 --> 00:19:52,124
Haha ha!

258
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:55,700
Hahaha! Hahahahaha!

259
00:19:56,155 --> 00:19:57,848
Hahaha! Hahahahaha!

260
00:19:58,554 --> 00:20:00,635
Hahaha! Hahahahaha!

261
00:20:09,162 --> 00:20:10,919
Boy oh boy the future.

262
00:20:10,969 --> 00:20:12,762
The future I can hardly wait.

263
00:20:12,766 --> 00:20:15,323
Oh, I think I'm
going to be sick.

264
00:20:18,816 --> 00:20:22,021
It seems that my lab is back
to its original order.

265
00:20:22,641 --> 00:20:25,056
Uh-uh, that is strange.

266
00:20:25,647 --> 00:20:28,522
I forgot how much
I hate time travel.

267
00:20:29,365 --> 00:20:33,263
It seems that were surrounded
by a very large pane.

268
00:20:33,356 --> 00:20:34,827
I'll say.

269
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:36,951
Air!

270
00:20:38,177 --> 00:20:40,081
Can't breathe!

271
00:20:40,098 --> 00:20:42,155
Gotta get out! Gotta get out!

272
00:20:42,195 --> 00:20:43,665
Out! Out!

273
00:20:44,098 --> 00:20:46,361
Let me out!

274
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,535
I gotta get it to work.

275
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:57,498
Freedom!

276
00:21:06,477 --> 00:21:07,964
We're out.

277
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:14,403
Hey this looks like a museum
about my old stuff.

278
00:21:15,518 --> 00:21:17,211
Wow!

279
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:20,442
Big Giant Dexo Robo.

280
00:21:21,336 --> 00:21:26,448
Man, me and this puppy have had
quite a few adventures together.

281
00:21:27,511 --> 00:21:28,849
Whats this?

282
00:21:32,252 --> 00:21:33,400
Ptooie.

283
00:21:34,177 --> 00:21:35,482
Ptooie.

284
00:21:38,091 --> 00:21:40,140
Styrofoam.

285
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,734
I did not build the giant
Dexo Robo out of Styrofoam.

286
00:21:44,854 --> 00:21:50,231
This is not a fair representation
of the genius that is Dexter.

287
00:21:50,282 --> 00:21:52,397
This is a piece of junk!

288
00:21:55,457 --> 00:21:57,572
Hey, what's with all the racket.

289
00:21:57,604 --> 00:21:58,999
Mandark?

290
00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:00,305
Ahhh!

291
00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:02,318
I'm typing I'm typing!

292
00:22:02,538 --> 00:22:06,245
I know that you Dexter and don't think
I haven't forgotten what you did to me.

293
00:22:06,297 --> 00:22:08,404
I'm still gonna get you Dexter!

294
00:22:14,136 --> 00:22:15,747
What are you doing?

295
00:22:15,865 --> 00:22:17,170
I'm typing.

296
00:22:17,173 --> 00:22:18,797
We'll cut it out and look.

297
00:22:19,325 --> 00:22:24,231
There's nothing left
of Mandark but his lame brain.

298
00:22:24,234 --> 00:22:25,468
I heard that!

299
00:22:26,522 --> 00:22:28,198
Lame brain.

300
00:22:28,202 --> 00:22:29,660
That's pretty funny.

301
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:35,179
I wonder what it was that Mandark
lost his head over.

302
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,343
Oh, I heard that too!

303
00:22:37,938 --> 00:22:39,763
Oh, I'm warning you!

304
00:22:39,913 --> 00:22:41,664
What are you going to do

305
00:22:41,776 --> 00:22:43,403
think something bad?

306
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,241
Why you...

307
00:22:45,244 --> 00:22:46,759
Come here and I'll teach
you a lesson.

308
00:22:47,062 --> 00:22:50,229
You'll see, I'll be back on my feet
and destroy you yet Dexter!

309
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,824
Poo. What is all the ruckus
in here?

310
00:22:55,858 --> 00:22:57,585
Who is causing all this?

311
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:59,040
Oh! My gracious!

312
00:23:01,389 --> 00:23:02,758
Who could have done this?

313
00:23:02,942 --> 00:23:04,938
Who would want
to destroy the homage

314
00:23:04,941 --> 00:23:07,796
to our all knowing
and omnipotent leader Dexter!

315
00:23:07,837 --> 00:23:09,960
I would!

316
00:23:10,003 --> 00:23:12,844
Oh! My gracious it's you!

317
00:23:13,008 --> 00:23:14,743
It's both of you!

318
00:23:16,136 --> 00:23:19,241
All hail the great
and powerful Dexters.

319
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:21,093
Proof at last.

320
00:23:21,357 --> 00:23:24,925
Young naive cease this
exultation at once

321
00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:27,246
and fetch us
your most elegant coach.

322
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:30,952
We require passage
to see our future self

323
00:23:31,003 --> 00:23:34,232
the great and powerful Dexter!

324
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:36,969
Yes, yes your grace,
of course right away!

325
00:23:37,024 --> 00:23:38,786
Thought transference
commencing in

326
00:23:38,823 --> 00:23:40,739
3, 2, 1.

327
00:23:41,569 --> 00:23:43,865
Amazing, what is this?

328
00:23:44,303 --> 00:23:46,690
It's a Teletronicicly
Manifested Bubble Transport.

329
00:23:46,903 --> 00:23:48,942
Teletronicicly Manifested.

330
00:23:49,057 --> 00:23:51,527
Yes, one merely has to think
of something and poof

331
00:23:51,571 --> 00:23:53,163
the matter is Teletronicicly
manifested.

332
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,899
Where does this new
science come from?

333
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,770
Why you of course.

334
00:23:58,773 --> 00:24:00,229
That is the future you.

335
00:24:00,393 --> 00:24:03,184
See, I told you
your idea's were genus.

336
00:24:03,381 --> 00:24:06,494
Dexters past, welcome
to your future.

337
00:24:07,618 --> 00:24:09,591
Welcome to Xtopia.

338
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,004
Thanks to your marvelous invention
of the Neurotomic Protocore.

339
00:24:16,064 --> 00:24:18,767
All of your knowledge
of science and technology

340
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:21,179
is disbursed freely
from your brain

341
00:24:21,182 --> 00:24:23,866
and into the brains
of every inhabitant

342
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:25,567
wearing a transference receptor.

343
00:24:25,612 --> 00:24:30,318
In turn causing universal
wisdom, peace, and harmony.

344
00:24:31,358 --> 00:24:33,274
See I told you.

345
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:35,015
We're here!

346
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:41,272
The Centralized Neurotomic information
and Power Distribution Pylon.

347
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:42,977
Oh, isn't it fab!

348
00:24:43,013 --> 00:24:44,675
Well, this is as far as I go.

349
00:24:44,705 --> 00:24:46,688
The great one isn't
for the likes of my lowly eyes.

350
00:24:46,948 --> 00:24:48,039
Good luck.

351
00:24:50,974 --> 00:24:54,079
It is just
like in the blueprints.

352
00:24:54,606 --> 00:24:59,379
And look! The Neurotomic Protocore
is at the heart of it all.

353
00:24:59,471 --> 00:25:03,584
We must be at the top
running the whole show.

354
00:25:06,113 --> 00:25:08,549
I did not think it could happen

355
00:25:08,677 --> 00:25:12,733
but I am more of a genius
than I already am.

356
00:25:13,548 --> 00:25:14,597
Shall we?

357
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:22,859
Who dares disturbed the great
and powerful Dexter!

358
00:25:23,013 --> 00:25:26,135
Once the profit signs
upon the world.

359
00:25:26,206 --> 00:25:29,353
We are the Dexter's of the past.

360
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:33,921
We have come from the past to find
out how we save the future

361
00:25:33,924 --> 00:25:35,922
you're all knowing presence.

362
00:25:35,949 --> 00:25:37,052
Presents!

363
00:25:37,114 --> 00:25:39,212
I didn’t know it
was my birthday.

364
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:40,626
I'll be right down.

365
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:43,796
Huh.

366
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:45,032
Huh.

367
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:46,414
Huh.

368
00:25:47,323 --> 00:25:47,802
Huh.

369
00:25:48,676 --> 00:25:49,123
Huh.

370
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,728
Who put these stairs here!

371
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:52,572
Huh.

372
00:25:53,452 --> 00:25:53,906
Huh.

373
00:25:54,841 --> 00:25:55,229
Huh.

374
00:25:56,258 --> 00:25:56,795
Huh.

375
00:25:57,406 --> 00:25:57,890
Huh.

376
00:25:57,893 --> 00:25:59,452
Ahhh!

377
00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:02,386
Ohh! My hip!

378
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,464
Hello.

379
00:26:28,477 --> 00:26:29,080
Hi.

380
00:26:29,342 --> 00:26:30,019
Hello.

381
00:26:30,092 --> 00:26:30,753
Hum.

385
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:33,551
Hello.

386
00:26:33,589 --> 00:26:34,258

387
00:26:34,312 --> 00:26:35,204
Hello.

388
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:35,910
Stop it.

389
00:26:35,982 --> 00:26:36,610
Who?

390
00:26:36,613 --> 00:26:37,208
What?

391
00:26:37,247 --> 00:26:37,990
Hello.

392
00:26:38,002 --> 00:26:38,680
Hi.

393
00:26:38,757 --> 00:26:39,491
Stop it.

394
00:26:39,607 --> 00:26:40,169
What?

395
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:40,910
Hello.

396
00:26:40,951 --> 00:26:41,612
Hi.

397
00:26:41,615 --> 00:26:42,235
Hay.

398
00:26:42,316 --> 00:26:43,199
Stop it.

399
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:43,711
What?

400
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:44,531
Hello.

401
00:26:44,575 --> 00:26:45,244
Hi.

402
00:26:45,302 --> 00:26:45,806
Huh?

403
00:26:45,881 --> 00:26:46,558
Hello.

404
00:26:46,629 --> 00:26:47,290
Hi.

405
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:48,033
Hello.

406
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:48,579
What?

407
00:26:48,595 --> 00:26:49,189
Hay.

408
00:26:49,261 --> 00:26:50,169
Stop it!

409
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:53,362
Where are my presents?

410
00:26:53,491 --> 00:26:54,978
We are your presents.

411
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:57,834
We are you. Don't
you recognize us?

412
00:26:57,901 --> 00:26:58,752
You are?

413
00:26:58,891 --> 00:27:00,617
Yes, you are us.

414
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,471
I am?

415
00:27:01,564 --> 00:27:03,447
You saved all of mankind.

416
00:27:03,604 --> 00:27:04,447
I did?

417
00:27:04,563 --> 00:27:06,099
Don't ya' remember.

418
00:27:06,102 --> 00:27:07,018
Remember what?

419
00:27:07,156 --> 00:27:08,809
How you did it?

420
00:27:08,905 --> 00:27:09,698
Did what?

421
00:27:09,747 --> 00:27:11,539
Save the future!

422
00:27:11,566 --> 00:27:12,218
I did?

423
00:27:12,323 --> 00:27:14,775
Yes, can you picture it,

424
00:27:14,828 --> 00:27:16,543
a world in dire need.

425
00:27:16,727 --> 00:27:17,355
Yes.

426
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:19,206
A world in need of a hero.

427
00:27:19,352 --> 00:27:19,979
Yes.

428
00:27:20,067 --> 00:27:22,297
And there's only one man
to do the job.

429
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,040
Yes.

430
00:27:23,177 --> 00:27:25,225
Romance machina.

431
00:27:25,233 --> 00:27:26,010
Yes.

432
00:27:26,095 --> 00:27:27,937
One man with the strength,

433
00:27:27,986 --> 00:27:29,217
the technology,

434
00:27:29,492 --> 00:27:32,051
the rugged good looks.

435
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,686
And that man is?

436
00:27:33,758 --> 00:27:35,913
Yes, yes, yes!

437
00:27:35,948 --> 00:27:37,154
Us!

438
00:27:37,182 --> 00:27:40,121
Yes, yes, yes.

439
00:27:40,124 --> 00:27:41,815
Do you remember?

440
00:27:41,818 --> 00:27:43,344
No!

441
00:27:43,588 --> 00:27:45,504
Apparently there's only one thing
left to do.

442
00:27:45,776 --> 00:27:48,221
We must again traveling time

443
00:27:48,223 --> 00:27:50,914
back to the very
time of our triumph.

444
00:27:50,972 --> 00:27:52,957
Back to see firsthand

445
00:27:53,016 --> 00:27:55,673
just how cool we've really are!

446
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:56,975
Yes.

447
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:01,792
Boy oh boy, I can hardly
wait to see how cool I was.

448
00:28:01,795 --> 00:28:03,860
Come on hurry up.

449
00:28:03,978 --> 00:28:05,473
Times a wasting.

450
00:28:05,565 --> 00:28:06,870
Let's go.

451
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,507
This is going to be great.

452
00:28:09,973 --> 00:28:10,972
He's not coming.

453
00:28:11,077 --> 00:28:13,391
- Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
- Don't you think

454
00:28:13,394 --> 00:28:14,787
you could move a bit faster.

455
00:28:14,904 --> 00:28:17,134
Think! I think I can.

456
00:28:19,744 --> 00:28:20,793
Here we go.

457
00:28:20,828 --> 00:28:24,784
Okay all right almost
there I got it now.

458
00:28:24,984 --> 00:28:27,555
I'm in. I'm in.

459
00:28:29,283 --> 00:28:30,299
Thanks Billy.

460
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:42,899
Coolness, here we come.

461
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:04,537
Oh, what happened
to the lab this time?

462
00:29:05,522 --> 00:29:07,686
Looks like a bomb hit.

463
00:29:10,106 --> 00:29:12,477
Hey look, oldie found a way out.

464
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:16,332
It is nice to know some of us
are still on the ball.

465
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,877
Zzz.

466
00:29:18,554 --> 00:29:19,611
Zzz.

467
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,112
Zzz.

468
00:29:21,477 --> 00:29:24,127
Here gramps,
penthouse chop chop.

469
00:29:24,316 --> 00:29:25,612
Elevator up.

470
00:29:25,749 --> 00:29:29,465
13th floor underwear,
outerwear, n' out of here.

471
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:31,679
Aw!

472
00:29:37,882 --> 00:29:41,619
Oh, what happened
to the world this time?

473
00:29:41,652 --> 00:29:44,129
Looks likes a bomb hit.

474
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:47,175
Does any of this ring
a bell with you?

475
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:48,819
Ding-dong

476
00:29:48,911 --> 00:29:49,985
Nope.

477
00:29:50,607 --> 00:29:52,647
Hay! People!

478
00:29:53,448 --> 00:29:55,150
Lets check it out!

479
00:29:55,406 --> 00:29:57,487
Geronimo!

480
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:07,522
Come on men, lets see if any of these
villagers can tell us what is going on.

481
00:30:11,582 --> 00:30:14,098
Pardon my good man

482
00:30:14,135 --> 00:30:19,791
but wouldst thou know 'where' and more
importantly, 'when' we today?

483
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:23,910
Anyone?

484
00:30:29,529 --> 00:30:33,394
Good gravy has everyone
around here lost their minds?

485
00:30:55,752 --> 00:30:57,701
Fire, come out fire.

486
00:30:59,518 --> 00:31:01,720
What happened to everyone!

487
00:31:01,745 --> 00:31:03,470
What is wrong with you?

488
00:31:03,504 --> 00:31:05,180
What are you trying to do?

489
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:08,924
We try to make fire
come out of wood.

490
00:31:09,566 --> 00:31:12,630
Okay, step back watch closely.

491
00:31:25,018 --> 00:31:26,058
Yea!

492
00:31:26,061 --> 00:31:26,786
Woo!

493
00:31:26,876 --> 00:31:27,776
Fire!

494
00:31:30,324 --> 00:31:32,149
By order of the overlord.

495
00:31:32,152 --> 00:31:33,760
All fires are prohibited.

496
00:31:33,772 --> 00:31:36,399
the creation of fire
is a punishable offense.

497
00:31:37,658 --> 00:31:38,567
Ahh.

498
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:40,780
The overlords machine man!

499
00:31:45,724 --> 00:31:49,209
Way to go smart guy now
we'll never know how cool we are

500
00:31:49,237 --> 00:31:51,971
coz' we're all going
to be ionized.

501
00:32:58,973 --> 00:33:01,103
Let there be fire for all!

502
00:33:06,142 --> 00:33:10,502
You see I told you, I told you
we were to be cool in the future.

503
00:33:10,537 --> 00:33:12,205
Did you see those moves!

504
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:13,470
That wrench.

505
00:33:13,473 --> 00:33:14,472
That brawn!

506
00:33:14,574 --> 00:33:15,598
That beard.

507
00:33:15,601 --> 00:33:16,568
The dome.

508
00:33:18,767 --> 00:33:20,907
Hey yeah, what happened?
 Hey yeah, what happened?

509
00:33:22,513 --> 00:33:23,144
Dexter! Dexter! Dexter!

510
00:33:23,191 --> 00:33:24,223
Wow!

511
00:33:25,233 --> 00:33:26,365
Oh yeah man!

512
00:33:26,597 --> 00:33:28,876
Your as cool as I always
wanted to be.

513
00:33:29,154 --> 00:33:30,813
Ah? Dexters?

514
00:33:30,954 --> 00:33:32,127
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

515
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,781
And we traveled
forward in the time

516
00:33:33,784 --> 00:33:34,583
'cause I heard I.

517
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:36,286
I mean… We said the future.

518
00:33:36,318 --> 00:33:38,011
But he couldn't remember.

519
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,534
So then we went back in time

520
00:33:39,574 --> 00:33:40,582
to find you

521
00:33:40,593 --> 00:33:43,303
and we did. And it was awesome.

522
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,985
Time travel, hum...

523
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:48,289
You boys will need to be
filled in on a few things.

524
00:33:48,321 --> 00:33:51,674
Yeah, like what happened
to the world?

525
00:33:51,744 --> 00:33:54,750
And who is science
hoarding overlord.

526
00:33:54,898 --> 00:33:55,856
Mandark.

527
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,105
Mandark! Mandark! Mandark!

528
00:33:58,978 --> 00:34:03,882
Many moons ago, Mandark and I were employed
by the corporation as research scientist

529
00:34:04,013 --> 00:34:07,481
to develop new technologies
for the betterment of the future.

530
00:34:07,656 --> 00:34:11,910
So naturally, as my genius produced
a fountain of amazing ideas.

531
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:16,119
A not so inspired Mandark
grew more and more jealous.

532
00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:20,528
He began stealing my creations
and presenting them as his own.

533
00:34:20,552 --> 00:34:22,675
As you may well remember.

534
00:34:23,171 --> 00:34:24,426
Grr.

535
00:34:24,674 --> 00:34:27,466
He soon gained favor
with the executive hierarchy

536
00:34:27,544 --> 00:34:30,022
and was quickly promoted
up through the ranks.

537
00:34:30,148 --> 00:34:31,816
And with one diabolical coup,

538
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:36,190
Mandark overthrew and became the very
President of the corporation himself.

539
00:34:37,198 --> 00:34:39,057
Then darkness fell.

540
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,736
Somehow my most prized invention

541
00:34:41,815 --> 00:34:44,194
the Neurotomic Protocore

542
00:34:44,297 --> 00:34:46,180
fell into Mandark clutches.

543
00:34:46,244 --> 00:34:50,324
Oh my gosh, we left
the core out in my cubicle.

544
00:34:51,455 --> 00:34:54,642
Mandark tried to employ
the powers of the core

545
00:34:54,665 --> 00:34:57,572
but the incompetent fool set
the positive flow to negative.

546
00:34:58,108 --> 00:35:03,042
And now corrupt energies of the core began
to twist Mandark already crooked mind.

547
00:35:03,357 --> 00:35:07,337
Making him even more greedy
insane than ever before.

548
00:35:07,476 --> 00:35:09,252
I could take it no more.

549
00:35:09,402 --> 00:35:12,367
To escape the perversion
of my own science.

550
00:35:12,386 --> 00:35:14,804
I went underground. Literally.

551
00:35:14,864 --> 00:35:17,193
I dug a tunnel
out from Mandark's tower.

552
00:35:17,304 --> 00:35:20,005
For years I dug and dug.

553
00:35:20,052 --> 00:35:22,364
Inching my way to freedom.

554
00:35:22,444 --> 00:35:26,085
But while I dug the negative
Neurotomic energy swept the world.

555
00:35:26,189 --> 00:35:28,130
Numbing the minds of the people.

556
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:34,395
Allowing Mandark to work is evil tentacles
into every facet of technology and society.

557
00:35:34,574 --> 00:35:36,936
It was as though he just
reached down

558
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:39,315
and raked the earth clean.

559
00:35:39,352 --> 00:35:43,102
Hoarding all science
all knowledge for himself.

560
00:35:43,272 --> 00:35:47,592
When I emerged I found this
world broken and stupid.

561
00:35:48,653 --> 00:35:50,361
I did what I could to help

562
00:35:50,394 --> 00:35:54,020
but with the overlords robots
enforcing terror across the land

563
00:35:54,103 --> 00:35:56,660
and very few resources
at my disposal.

564
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,908
It's been a fight
just to survive.

565
00:35:59,988 --> 00:36:04,249
Aw, buck up hero we found
the lab and we can all help.

566
00:36:04,381 --> 00:36:05,926
The laboratory!?!

567
00:36:05,929 --> 00:36:07,901
I had thought it lost forever.

568
00:36:07,939 --> 00:36:12,628
But with the power of the lab
plus the genius of me times four

569
00:36:12,635 --> 00:36:13,381
equals,

570
00:36:13,384 --> 00:36:17,753
the cataclysmic collapse
of the overlord empire of oppression!

571
00:36:17,806 --> 00:36:18,905
Yeah!Yeah! Yeah!

572
00:36:18,998 --> 00:36:20,485
To the laboratory.

573
00:37:11,249 --> 00:37:14,933
I'd like to take this time
to pat myselfs on the back.

574
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:19,517
Gentlemen, here's to another greatest
work completed,

575
00:37:19,693 --> 00:37:22,567
for tomorrow
we storm the castle!

576
00:37:22,652 --> 00:37:25,018
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

577
00:37:38,785 --> 00:37:41,054
Your overly lordness,
proximity alarm,

578
00:37:41,057 --> 00:37:44,313
registered an armed assault
vehicle on an attack vector.

579
00:37:44,409 --> 00:37:45,309
What?

580
00:37:45,391 --> 00:37:47,299
Imageizer on!

581
00:37:50,177 --> 00:37:51,622
How can this be?

582
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:53,228
Science is forbidden to all.

583
00:37:53,317 --> 00:37:55,868
Only I have the knowledge
to construct such a…

584
00:37:55,872 --> 00:37:56,898
Unless...

585
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:57,980
Micro-scan.

586
00:37:57,997 --> 00:37:59,359
Magnify!

587
00:38:01,841 --> 00:38:04,591
Dexter with Dexter,
Dexter, and Dexter.

588
00:38:04,594 --> 00:38:06,792
It isn't possible!

589
00:38:07,723 --> 00:38:10,628
It seems my old Nemesis has not
only mysteriously resurfaced

590
00:38:10,631 --> 00:38:13,687
but has also found a way to enlist
the aid of himself from other times!

591
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,936
No matter. Let them come.

592
00:38:15,997 --> 00:38:18,252
I have a few surprises
of my own.

593
00:38:21,918 --> 00:38:25,023
Mandark's castle is just
over the next ridge.

594
00:38:25,747 --> 00:38:28,044
This is it Dexter's!
We're going in.

595
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:19,396
Mandark!

596
00:41:22,728 --> 00:41:25,049
Your mechanized
minions are defeated.

597
00:41:25,088 --> 00:41:28,921
Now it's just you,
me, me, me and me.

598
00:41:41,321 --> 00:41:43,665
So Dexter, you thought
quadrupling your brain

599
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:43,668
So MightyMike77020,ht
quadrupling your brain

600
00:41:43,695 --> 00:41:45,478
power would be
enough to defeat me!

601
00:41:45,571 --> 00:41:48,420
Well I think it's safe
to even the playing field.

602
00:42:11,844 --> 00:42:13,507
Just like old times, eh?

603
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:15,849
Yes, quite the reunion but...

604
00:42:15,853 --> 00:42:21,401
Reunion sh-union! I want my Neurotomic
Protocore you gluttonous old hack!

605
00:42:21,586 --> 00:42:23,676
Never!

606
00:42:23,901 --> 00:42:25,326
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

607
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:26,871
Yeah!

608
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:29,719
Yar!

609
00:42:29,974 --> 00:42:31,163
Yar!

610
00:42:31,445 --> 00:42:32,432
Yar!

611
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,061
- You old raisin.
- You clod.

612
00:42:51,095 --> 00:42:53,003
- You smagegie.
- You nincompoop.

613
00:42:53,059 --> 00:42:53,976
You ding dong.

614
00:43:08,854 --> 00:43:10,482
- Grr.
- I ought a'.

615
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,102
Haha-ha.

616
00:43:26,218 --> 00:43:26,929
Haha-ha.

617
00:43:27,064 --> 00:43:28,118
Ha-haha.

618
00:43:28,121 --> 00:43:29,415
Haa haa-haa haa-haa!

619
00:43:29,489 --> 00:43:30,991
Haa haa-haa haa-haa!

620
00:43:31,204 --> 00:43:33,054
Haa haa-haa haa-haa!

621
00:43:33,226 --> 00:43:34,654
Haa haa-haa haa-haa!

622
00:43:38,892 --> 00:43:39,957
Oh my!

623
00:43:52,326 --> 00:43:55,943
That's it! If we can reach
the neurotomic flow controls

624
00:43:55,946 --> 00:44:00,373
and set it to positive, the protocore
will revert back to normal

625
00:44:00,427 --> 00:44:04,746
undoing the mind numbing evil these
mad Mandark's have unleashed.

626
00:44:16,514 --> 00:44:18,389
Ahhhh!

627
00:44:21,982 --> 00:44:23,543
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

628
00:44:30,063 --> 00:44:31,302
Oh?

629
00:44:36,493 --> 00:44:38,691
No! I've always wanted the core!

630
00:44:38,782 --> 00:44:40,591
No! I stole the core!

631
00:44:40,793 --> 00:44:42,816
No! The core is mine!

632
00:44:42,985 --> 00:44:45,579
No! Just because I'm
bitter and jealous!

633
00:45:24,578 --> 00:45:25,544
Huh?

634
00:45:31,048 --> 00:45:32,832
Go Dexter go!

635
00:45:33,224 --> 00:45:34,743
Go Dexter go!

636
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:36,199
Go Dexter go!

637
00:45:36,854 --> 00:45:37,960
Go Dexter go!

638
00:45:38,546 --> 00:45:39,561
Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go!

639
00:45:40,172 --> 00:45:41,221
Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go!

640
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:43,637
Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go!
 Go Dexter go!

641
00:45:44,049 --> 00:45:45,312
Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go!
 Go Dexter go!

642
00:45:45,822 --> 00:45:47,052
Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go!
 Go Dexter go!

643
00:45:47,607 --> 00:45:48,779
Go Dexter go! Go Dexter go!
 Go Dexter go!

644
00:45:49,765 --> 00:45:51,888
Yes, go Dexter go!

645
00:45:52,151 --> 00:45:53,192
Go Dexter go!

646
00:45:53,715 --> 00:45:54,856
Go Dexter go!

647
00:45:55,485 --> 00:45:56,608
Go Dexter go!

648
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:58,086
Go Dexter go!

649
00:45:58,672 --> 00:45:59,769
Go Dexter go!

650
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,703
♥ Dee Dee. ♥

651
00:46:01,821 --> 00:46:03,577
- Dee Dee!
- Dee Dee!

652
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:04,871
♥ Dee Dee. ♥

653
00:46:05,412 --> 00:46:07,386
♥ Dee Dee. ♥

654
00:46:07,646 --> 00:46:08,859
Dee Dee.

655
00:46:08,998 --> 00:46:11,510
♥ Dee Dee. ♥

656
00:46:12,168 --> 00:46:13,018
Dee Dee!

657
00:46:14,454 --> 00:46:17,757
Ooh, what does this button do?

658
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:12,207
Nooo!

659
00:47:32,236 --> 00:47:35,651
I remember! I remember!

660
00:47:36,043 --> 00:47:39,446
Dee Dee was the one who saved
the future!

661
00:47:40,626 --> 00:47:41,667
No way!

662
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:43,456
That didn't just happen!

663
00:47:43,667 --> 00:47:48,590
I wanted to be
the one who saved the future.

664
00:47:48,877 --> 00:47:50,740
Argh! That girl!

665
00:47:50,815 --> 00:47:54,251
I'll teach her to mess
up my future savings.

666
00:47:54,547 --> 00:47:56,364
Yeah, we'll show her!

667
00:47:56,697 --> 00:47:58,720
Ooh, that little ding dong!

668
00:47:59,157 --> 00:48:01,238
I'll get her once and for all.

669
00:48:03,136 --> 00:48:07,059
Robots! Destroyed
the one who saved the future!

670
00:48:13,818 --> 00:48:15,239
Well.

671
00:48:16,427 --> 00:48:18,005
That should take
care of Dee Dee.

672
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:20,982
It looks like the future
is back on track.

673
00:48:21,139 --> 00:48:23,490
I've got a lot
of cleaning up to do

674
00:48:23,492 --> 00:48:25,873
but with a positive
flow of the core

675
00:48:25,876 --> 00:48:27,998
everything should work out fine.

676
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:31,507
Well then, we should be getting
back to our own times.

677
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:33,048
Goodbye Dexter.

678
00:48:33,215 --> 00:48:34,437
Goodbye Dexter.

679
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:36,173
Goodbye Dexter.

680
00:48:36,394 --> 00:48:37,443
Goodbye Dexter.

681
00:48:37,671 --> 00:48:39,257
Goodbye Dexter.

682
00:48:39,455 --> 00:48:40,884
Goodbye Dexter.

683
00:48:41,028 --> 00:48:42,251
Goodbye Dexter.

684
00:48:42,343 --> 00:48:43,326
Goodbye Dexter.

685
00:48:43,499 --> 00:48:44,886
Goodbye Dexter.

686
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,251
Goodbye Dexter.

687
00:48:46,446 --> 00:48:47,809
Goodbye Dexter.

688
00:48:47,865 --> 00:48:49,380
Goodbye Billy.

689
00:48:56,206 --> 00:48:59,165
Boy, that isn't exactly
what I expected,

690
00:48:59,168 --> 00:49:02,883
but I did turn out pretty
cool in the future.

691
00:49:02,925 --> 00:49:07,124
Wait a minute I'm still
here fighting those robots.

692
00:49:07,127 --> 00:49:08,378
But wait,

693
00:49:08,391 --> 00:49:10,808
Those are the robots I just
built to get Dee Dee.

694
00:49:10,811 --> 00:49:13,048
While we're building the future.

695
00:49:13,154 --> 00:49:15,582
But now I'm
about to destroy them.

696
00:49:15,586 --> 00:49:18,460
Before I even decide
to go into the future.

697
00:49:18,512 --> 00:49:20,717
So that means when I came back.

698
00:49:20,721 --> 00:49:22,372
That means I came back too far.

699
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:23,837
Back before I ever left.

700
00:49:24,191 --> 00:49:25,520
So I must have come...

701
00:49:25,523 --> 00:49:26,242
No I...

702
00:49:26,246 --> 00:49:27,162
Or they were...

703
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:29,543
Aw, forget it.

704
00:49:29,719 --> 00:49:32,230
Time travel hurts my brain.
