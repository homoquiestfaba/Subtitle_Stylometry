00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,515
Yucatan peninsula, the year 1240.

2
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,309

That is the fifth al.

5
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,955
You want to enter them in the computer?

6
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,354
Or do you have one?

7
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,435
One somehow.

8
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,631

Enter the well but in.

10
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,558
It will do. If you but getting to the point.
- It has taken so long.

11
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,196
We must adapt to our words.
- Yes, we have to be careful.

12
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,756
Yes, let us do that.
- Only we should know about them.

13
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,469
Bowl, and we will do fine a few more.

14
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,555
We are starting the landing to
the Yucatan peninsula.

15
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,037
The weather is clear, 35 degrees
with a humidity of 80%.

16
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,869

Thank you flew with us.

17

Call for information its sister Alexis.

18
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,755
You are here somewhere, Hugh sister?

19
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,435
You understand not.
Barry would never against me lie.

20
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,599
He would never ... I trust it
fully. He is my man.

21
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,271
I trust him fully.
But he was off with his friends.

22
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,790
And he smoked cigars. I do not know...
- Mrs!

23
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,751
keeps your shuts up! I beseech you.

24
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,190
We are there. May I ask the money?

25
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,273
This is only half of it.

26
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,195
More I have not.

27
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,433
Wait, wait! Here you can not be! Barry

28
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,312
he would never come here.

29
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,518
I thought you gave me!

30
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,518
Oscar.
- Ha which Nico. How is it?

31
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,157
Best, best.
Give me such a drink with that fruit.

32
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,628
Amigo, your account is too high.
First pay.

33
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,228
That I tell you the whole week al.

34
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,793
This should be enough.

35
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,677
Not really. But what would the? This is nevertheless
a charity, not where?

36
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,516
And? What was it with that woman?

37
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:44,915
Best, best.

38
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,795
But m'n messed up throughout the day.

39
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,836
Yes, otherwise you could here
the entire day can delirium.

40
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,032
Da gezeik's better than that.
- Go Ahead. What am I doing here?

41
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,669
That 'gezeik' is required so that you make money on
it and can pay the bill.

42
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,671
That chore was three hours.
- three long hours.

43
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,356
You are by far the
most lazy man i know.

44
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,875
As drinking i.

45
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,916
That is indeed something to
be proud of. Way to go, my friend.

46
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,877
I A 'Rumrunner'?
- Definitely, Seno Rita.

47
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,436
You are certainly American?

48
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,512
O my God. How do you know?

49
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,395
a wild guess.

50
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,434
a wild guess, huh?

51
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,355
What is your name?

52
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,428
Allison. And you?

53
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,639
say but Nico, Queen.

54
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,513
O my God, you speak Spanish. What kind.

55
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,709
PLEASE WAIT... 'I go...'

56
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17.199
'of the...'

57
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,112
Grand Rapids, Michigan.

58
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,674
When I graduated was
I did not know what I wanted to do.

59
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,998
What should you do with a
university degree in Mathematics?

60
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,159
There is no fun to experience.
And I wanted some fun experience.

61
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,956
So when I am
going to do the Master Training. Strange word, Masters.

62
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,039
What means that well?
That i asked to m'n professor.

63
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,277
He replied...
God, what he said again?

64
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,234
I know many. Back to the subject.
Dolphins so.

65
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,718
I therefore fail to understand why dolphins
always get caught in the nets.

66
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:03,517
They have absolutely no gills.
The are mammals. Breathing air.

67
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,029
So they need to come out of the water.

68
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,358
and then take a deep breath. Then
they can back under water swimming.

69
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,234
very interesting as
mammalian in the water to life.

70
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,715
That must have been very complicated.

71
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,512
Come on, you speak
a little English?

72
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,919
her team is looking for five days and
you have no idea what they are?

73
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,833
That you do not think?

74
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,075
You said 'police agency'?
That is nowhere in sight.

75
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,637
There is only a lemonade stand.
- Go away, I am crazy about you.

76
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,876
You Speak English now?

77
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,878
Have you discovered nothing after five days?

78
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:EUR 47.873
I think nothing of.

79
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,192
You want at least my flyer hang up?
Is that too much to ask?

80
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,677
Mrs, my sister is
already five days lost...

81
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:20,317
excuse Mr.
You may have seen this lady?

82
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,595
Good Luck.

83
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,475
sorry, Sir. Does
this lady you may be familiar for?

84
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,836
It is my sister. She is blond, 28 years old.
They are living here about five years.

85
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,594
It is here with a team of archaeologists
to investigate the ruins. Mr?

86
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,353
You kidding me.

87
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,632
Nice, though.
- Pardon?

88
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,234
That ie is very nice.

89
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,075
What is nice?

90
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,238
Well you back. Your Ass.

So. That is very nice.

00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,152
What have I done heck?

94
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,508
Who is it?
- I have no idea.

95
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,437
I only know that they are looking for this woman.

96
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,035
This.

97
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,436
Wait. Let remains to be seen.

98
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,316

101
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,311

Kweeniet.

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,399
I can go back to the city.
It was only six hours ago.

105
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,114
six hours but?

106
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,672
Maybe they are there.

107
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,834
waiting for us.
- waiting for us.

108
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,632
Bowl, than we achieve its.

109
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,958
It is to that tent that which
sells ice cream where you are so fond of.

110
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,513
Who with pepinosmaak?

00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:55,879
. They have a week long
sat in a cave. They are about sensitive or so.

117
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,231
Why you took them?

119
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,948
Search that woman. She is a problem.
How you can find her are you looking for self but off.

120
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,116
I have no pull in
annoying snoopers.

00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,190
No worries. I adjust the self.

122
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,435

Not. But I know someone
who can help you may have.

127

You know someone? To whom?

128
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,479
This man has helped me
to save soldiers in each other.

129
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,113
where can I find it?

130
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,715
Bar.

131
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,155
What bar?

132
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,672
This bar.
- he is the owner? The bartender?

133
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,195
It is eleven hours in the morning.
You Z'n private number?

134
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,317
No, he is now there.

135
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,357
Well than. On to the bar.

136
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,355

correctly. That is there. You can do
not disturb him better, he is hard at work.

139
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,437
No, huh? You are the.
- What do you mean by that?

140
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,994
Fine. The mutt who can be instructed.

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,272
I know you, or so?

142
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,156
We have met each other short.

143
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,795
We...?

144
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,114
Now I know the weather.

145
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,519
The wife of the beach, huh?
Yes, you were still looking for your sister?

146
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,112
You was rude to me.

147
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,075
sit.

148
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,313
tell me what is wrong.

149
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,395
My sister Lauren and her
two partners are missing.

150
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,276
They are archaeologists and
examined the ruins.

151
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,279
five days ago
they suddenly disappeared without trace.

152
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,836
No one who helps me or who
care about. Everyone hate me.

153
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,748
I do anything.
I am nice and calm to everyone.

154
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,873
And yet they help me.
So now you can get to you and I implore you

155
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,712
on m'n naked knees,
help me please m'n sister to find.

156
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,594
No wedding ring, huh?
- I knew it!

157
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:generated was 58,073
you have a boyfriend?

158
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,635
You cannot deny that
they see me at all.

159
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,717
for sure. That is why she went
there as a missile rocket.

160
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,400
You charms were too much for her.

161
00:23:ECU 18 080 --> 00:23:19,832
I have done the weather, huh?

162
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,836
You do not need to ask for more or you
behave as a bag.

163
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,793
go there just
that you always do.

164
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,275
That will then be.

165
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,236
Not to worry, Joh.
They did not.

166
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,230
What should you do?
- my apologies.

167
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,672
I had something drunk too much.
- Logical, at eleven in the morning.

168
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,391
That You mean sarcastic.

169
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,999
I am a simple man,
that of simple things.

170
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,078
Swimming, appetizers.
They know me in that bar.

171
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,876
Sleep i do very much. And
Diving. And a well in m'n hammock.

172
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,719
And very occasionally I do agree a job.

173
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:35,912
They call me private detective, But that is
not true. I know many people simply.

174
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,715
If somebody pays
i search from whom the barge has

175
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,957
or with which local
lady hubby strange.

176
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,629
That is easy and it is always
the same local lady.

177
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:51,197
You Know How stupid you sound?
Try me not more to cheer.

178
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,275
simply go away.

179
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,715
Go to home.
- No worries. You can see me not more.

180
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:02,915
That is not the issue. You must be lazy from
the road continue. Here comes misery of.

181
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,468
That my decision.
- The are very dangerous lazy.

182
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,751
I can best for myself.
- Chemistry yet!

183
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,034
You go well but only swears lamb in your
bar, whoring drinker. I care for myself!

184
00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28,437
Who are you? What do you think of me?
- Head close!

185
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:33,553
That policeman is a friend of me!
I do everything what you want!

186
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,115
Head close! I will be brief.

187
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,996
So they will at least be quiet.

188
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,310
You drive laps, So... there!

189
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,078
I know where I need to go.

190
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,996
we let her put on a boat

191
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,792
and then thrown overboard.

192
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,275
Or we shoot it by its head

193
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,753
And buried her.

194
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,757
We cut into chunks and its

195
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,075
implement to the crocodile.

196
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,236
That goes a little too far for me.

197
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,638
You drive error. You had left, not right.

198
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,318
That you doing always.

199
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,160
I can make me so angry about.

200
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,268
I get that thing not of your head before
you say you my need assistance.

201
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,635
then speak.

202
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,477
then speak.
- Make something better for yourself.

203
00:29:00,480 Keep --> 00:29:03,153
Come, I will bring you to the airport.
- No.

204
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,591
No?
- Not without my sister.

205
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,714
You have not seen what has just happened?
O, no. You were blindfolded.

206
00:29:6 800 --> 00:29:18,316
What you saw was not a naive girl
that should not have had to

207
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,036
interfere, but it did and when it
was kidnapped by heavy boys

208
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:29,030
who had murdered her almost. There are
still many more of the guests.

209
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,593
I am not without its.

210
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,359
Now happens.
Exactly what I did not want.

211
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,631
Now I must work hard.

212
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,155
m'n hip bottle.

213
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,075
What is that?

214
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,549
I have to that car thrown.

215
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,716
We drink.
- That Have you not necessary.

216
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,355
Do you think?

217
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,994
Really, doctor?

218
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,956
How do you know what I need?

219
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,156
When I say that I wish to drink, what
I drink.

220
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,073
about your sister...
She is probably dead.

221
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,911
Sorry, but so are those lazy.

222
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,594
They kill people without mercy.

223
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,792
Surely do what I say, that you would
also like sister. Go home safely.

224
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,275
They is not dead! I do not believe so.

225
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,036
You do not know what they are talking about.

226
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,794
We need to know why
they been abducted. I will pay you.

227
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,310
It will take to ransom.
That happens here as often.

228
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,635
It is not.
- How do you know that?

229
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,156
you see that man behind me?
On the opposite side. In that gray shirt.

230
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,558
He was involved in
a lot of shops here.

231
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,155
Who is he?

232
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,478
He called Lester Hunter.
He is still for a few days.

233
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:33,230
He came today. He owns more
than a documents Mayan art museum.

234
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,557
and sometimes
he steals them from a museum.

235
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,116
He is the greatest
collector of Maya treasures.

236
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,274
He is wrong loads.

237
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,318
And he owns the people here.
The police has already helped you?

238
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,112
No.
- that is due to him.

239
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,437
But about him you
do not need to worry.

240
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:59,315
previously to the man who are brunt
. Javier Alhabo Olivares.

241
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,558
He is a grave Rover. A thief. He gives
to nothing and no one, only has itself.

242
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,709
How did you know that he would be here?
- This is his bar. And the bar also.

243
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,636
And the bar in addition.
The entire street is of him.

244
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,354
you can see where you have?
- What should he with my sister?

245
00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27,313
They would have found something?
- Maybe.

246
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,556
How we come to know this?
- We?

247
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,234
You have not heard me?
- I pay you!

248
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,271
No... How many?

249
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,990
No! Orphan no hero.
Keep your outside, they make you wonder.

250
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,634
Then I ask him yourself.
- Go Ahead.

251
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,911
I am sure.
- Do not leave but what you can.

252
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,432
They does not work.
- Lester!

253
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,034
Walking really not the road!

254
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,196
as well... I love it!

255
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,436
I try to help you. Jesus!

256
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,716
go well no suicide.

257
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,313
Why have you drink
thrown about yourself?

258
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,318
she has her drink
about who love thrown.

259
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:26,473
My sister is five years ago to
come and I have never visited her.

260
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,154
It is my own stupid debt.
She calls and emails often

261
00:33:31,280 Future --> 00:33:DEM 33,43
but i always to pressure.

262
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,836
I had the best time. They
always did things in order to improve the world.

263
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,792
And you must see what I do.

264
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,911
They is a fantastic man.

265
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,715
I took the reproached that
they moved to Mexico.

266
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:05,352
My parents went to separate. I
had to mediate and she sat nice here.

267
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,154
I do not know what I blame.

268
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,880
They wanted hassle not in her life.

269
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,432
And i had to her that
considerably if necessary rub.

270
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,196
You know that I really am a trut am?

271
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,400
You have found it?
- No, not yet.

272
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,638
It is not so difficult.

273
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:39,550
You are already a week in progress. You said
that it would take a couple of days.

274
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:44,235
Where do I pay you?
Explain to me that once again.

275
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,397
We are almost there, man.
- Make sure that you place.

276
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,115
We are close to,
we can find the any time.

277
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,835
So difficult is it not possible!
Enter the pressure continues on!

278
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,952
I must do everything yourself?

279
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,436
and make sure that you find it.
- Do i.

280
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,838
I do not need to tell you what
happens if you do not find it.

281
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,556
I do not think.
I do get a headache. And hemorrhoids.

282
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:14,960 Lt
I swear none of man. Get well but
not to worry, you get your mask.

283
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:19,631
Make sure, otherwise I care for you.
Get your but nothing in your head.

284
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,953
No problem, I go further.
- do you do it in your pants?

285
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:35,231
You chatters as a chicken without head.
Make well but that you find it.

286
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,634
Do you want to do your work, then I do my own.

287
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,595
understood?

288
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,835
All these documents
on the Mayan calendar.

289
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,954
O that. We will all be dead in 2012?

290
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:$ 18,275
That is the end of the Mayan
calendar and the world.

291
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,428
The end of the world is but a
rumor. My sister writes something about it.

292
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:27,075
There is that they
stick to one and the same time calendars two.

293
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,034
And that the count every
52 years starts again.

294
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,719
And it ends in 2012.
- Yes, but...

295
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,398
you see? The ends.
Everyone says that the Mayas wisdom.

296
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,435
And we feel that their calendar
ends, but not that the imminent apocalypse?

297
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,792
You Know How stupid you sound?
- we leave this guest questions.

298
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,957
They is at a shaman.
- a shaman?

299
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,239
here is the village and his address.
- Then we go to him.

300
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,676
Am around ten hours awake,
we go there.

301
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,313
No, we are right now.

302
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,835
Now?

303
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,359
Okay.
Hopefully we make him not awake.

304
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,195
He is not there.

305
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,033
What is that for music?

306
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,035
We go and have a look.

307
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,355
What do you think?

308
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,518
Well, it is in any case wake up.

309
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,833
We say goodbye.

310
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,391
That was not such a good idea.

311
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,275
Alexis?

312
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:17,150
your sister is a good friend of us.
We have you on a photo seen.

313
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,355
Your wedding photos.

314
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,514
foreign wedding.

315
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,515
So'n wedding is nothing for me.

316
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,437
your sister is entered properly
in the Mayan culture.

317
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,556
They came with me a week ago.

318
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:42,470
They said they
had discovered something important about the location of the mask

319
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,910
of a large king.
Our most sacred leader.

320
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,999
What they discovered?
- a tablet, buried under a stele.

321
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,875
What is a Stele?

322
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,795
A memorial or monument
in the form of a pillar.

323
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,038
You sister and her archaeological
team were working to examine the

324
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,118
under what stele
was buried the mask.

325
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,113
has found it?
- we do not know.

326
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,673
They were close.

327
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,557
Maybe they have even discovered,
but they have disappeared.

328
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,832
What was that for mask?

329
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,678
long ago there was war between
the Totonaken and the Mayas.

330
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,232
They wanted to eradicate us.

331
00:39:.............................................. 26,200 --> 00:39:31,957
was at that time the mask our most sacred
treasure. But they did it depends on us.

332
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,509
The Totonaken believed that the
mask the Mayas.

333
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,314
One brave Maya tried
to get back the mask.

334
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:48,078
The succeeded to regain the mask,
but he died during his mission.

335
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,551
What happened with the mask?

336
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:56,312
The legend says that he was hiding in
an underground pool under a stele.

337
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,910
The Ghosts of the cenote, the
underground Poel, protect the.

338
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,833
What a relief.

339
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:13,159
There breaks a new time, where
the reality belongs the universe.

340
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,957
That guy do not
even what happens in reality.

341
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:30,193
What would that mask of you are
worth for an American?

342
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:36,716
people getting lost in the illusion
of life. They see not clear.

343
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,675
So is that.

344
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,153
five million or so?

345
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,511
Name one a global amount.

346
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,312
drinking.
- I know how to use to drink.

347
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,073
That is not best.
I would but discarded.

348
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,351
is correct. It is damaged or so.

349
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,275
It feels good.

350
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,915
What have you got?

351
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:27,755
it going?

352
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,715

353
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,355

354
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,316
Contact What is yours,
let are what is not yours.

355
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,750
Contact What is yours,
let are what is not yours.

356
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,595
come with me.

357
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,309
Contact What is yours,
let are what is not yours.

358
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,555
Good Morning.

359
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,195
where are we?

360
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,114
on the way to your house.

361
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,798
What happened last night?
I have nothing doms done?

362
00:43:32,200 international --> 00:43:36,318
completely refuted. You was very quiet.
You have sat here just the whole night.

363
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,588
Nice. I hate it when i flauwval.
I don't as...

364
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,354
Well done, though.

365
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,198
Calm, i get 'm back to that.

366
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,753
Are you really so stupid?

367
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,835
Calm.

368
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,279
It is over 30 meters deep!

369
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,149
The current drags everything below

370
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,235
to the sea!

371
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,873
I get 'm. Quiet.

372
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,274
you doing but quiet.

373
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,914
That USD 800 comes from your salary.

374
00:44:ECU 20,400 --> 00:44:21,799
USD 800?

375
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,957
Goodness...

376
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,833
I can not find it.

377
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,712
You considers the.

378
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:43,995
Wait...

379
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,350
What a surprise.

380
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,717
What a set of idiots.

381
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,956
I never think also good men.

382
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,034
You are a dunce, not where?

383
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,195
Coffee?

384
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,595
I drink in the morning always coffee.

385
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,198
you think that the hassle
of tonight is nonsense?

386
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,633
I hear this meaning still,
I am crazy about.

387
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,476
What said that shaman against you?

388
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,832
A while back I had
some problems in the USA.

389
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,759
I couldn't.

390
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,193
I now why there is here.

391
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,195
Someone death driven with a sip on?

392
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,634
But.
- Sorry.

393
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,355
Tell but.

394
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,198
I was in the army.
One of our operations went wrong.

395
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,719
I got the debt.

396
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,634
Surely this is no reason to leave?

397
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,715
for me.

398
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,672
We need your sister.

399
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,834
And that we are going to do so...
- Tell.

400
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,635
found?

401
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:58.954
not yet.

402
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,675
There is anything scary at this place.

403
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,869
Is that so?

404
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:06,632
So eng that you balls have krimpen?

405
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,954
incredible.

406
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,349
And? Nothing?

407
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,152
We have searched everywhere.

408
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,235
Keep looking.

409
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,311
Diego! What have you got?
Are you not good necessarily or so?

410
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,558
Sorry, Javier.
I was in the mud rolls.

411
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,636
Really? That I had not seen.

412
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,791
I searched for your piece of art.

413
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,833
You have found it?

414
00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:45,915
Keep Looking!

415
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,552
It is difficult search...

416
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,270
Even news?
- What are we going to do now?

417
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,558
We must find.
That is the only option.

418
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,877
Or would you like to
repay Lester $400,000?

419
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,835
I do not.

420
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,949
So grab a ships
a flashlight and go graves.

421
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,953
You have easy talk, dwarf.
I get claustrophobic.

422
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:18,197
And it is fine for me here?
- i could not care less about!

423
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:58,912
We find Arturo and Josmul.
- I am Josmul. What do you think of me?

424
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,354
You worked for my sister, Lauren Sofer?
- indeed.

425
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:07,476
You know that she is missing?
- that I heard.

426
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,671
I told you what they found?

427
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,916
I voted against nobody said something,
but someone I know perhaps.

428
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,634
Who then? Please tell us.

429
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:36,549
He hears me.
He will also remain still.

430
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,273
What are you doing here?

431
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,558
We work on a
glass-bottomed boat.

432
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:08,036
We put things that
you can see through the glass.

433
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,273
So you carelessly think up the Tourist?
- that is the way it is.

434
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,835
What is it with you?

435
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,154
What flik you me well?

436
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,316
I went nearly dead down there!

437
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,953
You murdered me almost!

438
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:32,029
We know that you worked for her and
that you have told someone about it. Whom?

439
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:37,359
I do not recall that I
have told someone. Certainly not instant.

440
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,714
I need no money.

441
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,312
Although i have family,
with two children.

442
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,433
I do it for my family.
- Keep your head.

443
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:58,759
I was in the church, with my image clean
wife and two bloedjes of children.

444
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,078
We always go on sunday because
his father Ramiro than the sermon.

445
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,636
I love the sermon.
And then we buy an ice cream.

446
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:11,709
I give the good example, so my
children Salita, Juanita, Ramiro and

447
00:51:EUR 11.840 --> 00:51:15,116
Estacio on the straight path.
- let us come to the point.

448
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:21,192
correctly. After the Miss I ran with my family
hand in hand at the car park.

449
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:25,836
Then there came a man to us,
he pointed to me and threatened me.

450
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:30,397
He has a knife and says that ie
me and my wife dies.

451
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:34,513
So I swim out and save the knife
from Z'n hands. He kicked me

452
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:39,395
But fortunately I train much in the
sports school, so I skipped 'm.

453
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:43,354
But when handles are friends me.
I just wanted to say.

454
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,879
smote the from me.

455
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,835
He putted on my kidneys and broke my
nose. And probably also a rib.

456
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,632
It is still doing pain.

457
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,955
What 'dwong' he to tell you?

458
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,433
I do not know more.

459
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,033
He has me so often
on m'n main skipped.

460
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,794
Now I know the weather.

461
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:11,788
I told him that we had the tablet
where on was where the mask.

462
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,235
where than?

463
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:juice 18,639
That they told us
we could not and cannot read the tablet.

464
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,718
I only know where we did find it.
Look.

465
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:25,150
That he has done.
One of its many outrages.

466
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,474
He is a withers!

467
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,474
Evil.

468
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:32,878
But i had to protect my family.
They are everything for me.

469
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,832
I am away here.
- come with me.

470
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:47,359
If you want to go on a boat tour
to find you know me. I hope I have helped you.

471
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,038
A week ago was my sister still here.

472
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,755
Now i finally see where they work.

473
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,034
I feel like her feel.

474
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,192
There is no more.

475
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,077
you find that funny?

476
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,718
So long in which smallpox cave
without result?

477
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:33,278
We have told us what we know.
- I think you don't! Not really!

478
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:37,195
How we then explain.
- Lieg not against me.

479
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:41,108
We don't lie.
Do not something you will regret it.

480
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,196
do no harm to him.
- Sit!

481
00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:44,915
Not do so.

482
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:49,559
I cut it into pieces.
Do you want to know how he looks like?

483
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:55,308
You are looking for in the wrong place.
- where we must then find?

484
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:56,795
There.

485
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:01,234
What chat you're?
You said first, at the fourth stele.

486
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,875
It is the fifth.

487
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,709
Now he wants to talk to.
Where is the fifth stele?

488
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,434
where?
- We do not know exactly where.

489
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:13,870
The area is approximately 15 square meters.
- Tell on!

490
00:54:14,960 Lt --> 00:54:18,316
It is located 60 meters to the
south west of the stele.

491
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,435
You Play American Football?

492
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,430
You are going to help us.
One of you will note.

493
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:31,438
Well, 60 meters to the south west
of the stele so. Carlo!

494
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,751
let them go, then I continue!

495
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,199
I will stay!

496
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:47,677
No, everyone goes. If you me
again that I cut you cheap shots pieces!

497
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,319
I cut your throat open!

498
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,150
walk! And head close!

499
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:53,795
Come along!

500
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,594
Come along! Hurry!

501
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:03,755
Look, here is something about 2012.
- What is there ?

502
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:08,199
that we all die?
- It is not true, that I said right?

503
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,675
That you said but it is next to.

504
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:15,078
everything ends, the calendar, the time.
A new ice age or so.

505
00:56:10,16 --> 00:56:11,115
Wait!

506
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,513
That side. Run!

507
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,433
You leave me alone?
- Not to worry!

508
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,109
There is a spin in m'n her?

509
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,913
Where do you jerk?

510
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,273
come out!

511
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,348
You have m'n nose broken, no more.

512
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,595
I had home a Tae Bo DVD. I have
a lot of mugs and lamps broken.

513
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,675
And the TV. A flat still.

514
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,550
Bowl, lubricate we 'm. Quiet.

515
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,832
Come on!
- I can no longer.

516
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,519
I can no longer.
- Keep on with those excuses.

517
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,315
Jumping!

518
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,195
Javier?

519
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:29,035
Diego?
- There is something bad happened.

520
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,228
They are beaten up.
- What Who?

521
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,715
A man and a woman.
- 'A' wife?

522
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,395
Okay, the sister.

523
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:44,830
say the men but that they were very
good at their job. Excellent even.

524
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:46,395
especially you.

525
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:49,758
They get promotion
especially that good work.

526
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,198
They will very happy.
- that I could imagine.

527
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,788
May I ask you something?
- Of Course.

528
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,593
What would it be?
- underground cave.

529
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:30,470
would be there Lauren?
- Maybe. You have a phone with you?

530
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:34,839
Yes, but it is very
expensive to call here... Sorry.

531
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,030
I know someone who can help us.

532
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,391
All kits?
- hoi, how does it work?

533
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:03,995
well.

534
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:08,273
I have to think about this
and I think it is not a good plan.

535
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,355
Why not?

536
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,558
Because you can go dead.
Or even worse.

537
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,152
What is worse than death?

538
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:23,119
Why do you make me always
ridiculous if ladies at?

539
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,516
You're right hear,
there is nothing worse than death.

540
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:31,997
I would just like to say that it
is a maze where you can drown.

541
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,872
a maze sometimes I can.

542
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:39,194
take someone with you to a cord
, you'll always find the way back.

543
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,080
It is too deep, I am only.
- I go!

544
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,155
Why not?

545
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,953
You Can diving?
- No.

546
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,593
Then you can join in.

547
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:49,912
Leave the card to be seen.

548
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:53,239
Those cards do not see everything.

549
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:56,875
There are huge open up
areas down there.

550
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:03,200
Some pieces are less than half a
meter wide. I have sat here ever hours.

551
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,959
I was a day in the decompression room.

552
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:09,709
So there is really nothing.
Incredibly boring.

553
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:14,397
I have 75 games
played solitaire. Not one won.

554
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:19,389
Not once. This is due to that of Aces.
You can capture the best below

555
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,715
or still be ready to top...
- Oscar!

556
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:26,633
Even with card is the difficult
remember where you've been.

557
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:30,150
I have a good memory.
- This is really not a good plan.

558
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,235
I go, okay?

559
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:36,836
Well then, you may borrow my stuff.
Because you have such a poor customer

560
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:41,158
You never paid and
probably die there.

561
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,193
Why pik you do that?
- he is a great host.

562
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:47,232
He does not pay and
take a mockery of you.

563
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:52,839
Because i permits. He is a hero.
- It will do. Our military.

564
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,432
Really, he was a variety of awards

565
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:59,870
and then a shovel under
Z'n ass of the government.

566
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,834
What happened?
He said that a mission expired incorrectly.

567
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:06,793
He did nothing wrong. The Government.

568
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:10,436
His team was
sent to a prohibited area.

569
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:13,472
when it was discovered that
they gave him the debt.

570
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:17,479
He has never said anything.
He is lost everything.

571
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:20,557
So he come here.

572
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:24,309
Dishonorable dismissal is the
worst thing that can happen to him.

573
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,952
worse than death.
Hugh! So that is worse than death.

574
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,912
But good.
I would have done the same.

575
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,713
I am only if the death for pistols.

576
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:41,071
So I would like to
have become redundant.

577
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,478
That was fast.
You have to keep your hands washed?

578
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,230
You does not come to my
stuff until you have washed.

579
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,231
Thanks, gozer. Goodbye.

580
01:03:55,680 --> 01:04:00,959
You drink not drunk.
You can see that you have a poor customer?

581
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,158
You know that such
beverage me will cost money?

582
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:07,192
Coconuts do
not grow on the tree, though!

583
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,394
Coconuts grow to a tree.

584
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:14,750
That I know,
but that is not the point right now.

585
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:56,273
where is my mask?

586
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:01,316
your mask?
- I thought it was of the Mayas.

587
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:04,395
eight hundred years old
- Where is it?

588
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:07,997
In the banana tree,
send your gorilla but.

589
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:12,954
A REAL comedian.
- M'n job. I am a scientist.

590
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:17,358
First boy, then heavy comedian,
now again scientist. Where?

591
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,034
We know not.

592
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:27,074
So you don't know? I will give you a
six seconds to get to know it.

593
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,158
Why six seconds?
Da's a strange number.

594
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,713
It is an even number.

595
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:36,072
is correct. You can make the parts by three and
two. It is an even number

596
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:40,512
But there is an odd choice.
- Your friend is smart. Which number do you want?

597
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:45,236
No, six is fine. The are the seconds
where i have a problem with it.

598
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:48,716
rather than six weeks,
or six months, what do you think?

599
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:49,795
Head close!

600
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,353
What you thought of three?

601
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:53,595
Three?

602
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:54,915
Two.

603
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:40,955
All kits, Les?

604
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:46,036
What it is. Those two have something of me,
but they do not say where it is.

605
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:completed at 31.12.1991 remain
which of the two do?

606
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,673
All two, I think.

607
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:55,198
Who of you know?

608
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:00,754
No one, that we have already told him.
- I see from here that he lieth.

609
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,273
But you know for
sure that you want to do this?

610
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:09,837
Maybe not,
but I have no other option.

611
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:13,748
You can
bind one to the anchor and thrown overboard.

612
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,075
Then that other great fear.

613
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,032
So'n scientist.

614
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,910
What a good idea.
But unfortunately the anchors.

615
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,353
pity.
Then you must add it but gunning.

616
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:33,154
It, then.

617
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:37,312
What are you doing?

618
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:42.195 km.
I m'n woman told that i
have bad water drinking and not from can.

619
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,275
No yet?

620
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:47,439
know for sure. Terribly.
I was three days on the toilet.

621
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:50,433
save me the details.

622
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:56,078
I feel a lot better. I must go back
to the hotel, my wife is so.

623
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:01,032
Do the sharks the greetings.

624
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:08,919
I love that crazy.

625
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:12,755
Vissenkop!

626
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:22,875
standing.

627
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:27,711
You too. Pull 'm.

628
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:29,555
standing.

629
01:08:31,200 create --> 01:08:32,633
remained where was I?

630
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:35,475
One.

631
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:40,595
What flik you? That would not have had!
- that needed to be!

632
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:42,354
And well your head close!

633
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,516
You i will come to you.

634
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:47,756
you tell me where that mask is?

635
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:50.875
Well?

636
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,272
of course tell you that.

637
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:57,915
God bless you.

638
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:37,952
Maybe we should
think of something else.

639
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:43,076
This is the best way to do so.
- Can I get something for you?

640
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:46,591
No, thank you.

641
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:57,476
It is a final swimming.
I will create something for you?

642
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:03,356
a sandwich. Something else...

643
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,435
Notify.

644
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:08,595
Sorry. But I would like to help you.

645
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:31,313
That you this is all for my family.
I am sorry that at your doubts.

646
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,512
I think I have everything.

647
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:53,074
I wait until sunrise.
I want to make sure that they are all there.

648
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,915
I agree that guy verified

649
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:24,350
that you and your girls as for crazy.

650
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,155
I listen.

651
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:32,310
He shows one or other command.
He was eleven years by the Navy Seals.

652
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:37,719
He did illegal missions all over the world
. He is responsible for the

653
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:41,515
murder of Mustafa, you understand.
So say you do that? Mustafa?

654
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:49,316
You know, those Hibiki Hibiki Wong or
Wang, I know how much that is hot.

655
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:52,473
He is an experienced murderer.
- Experienced?

656
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:59,674
He is a type of Rambo, you know
, but then Mexican.

657
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,595
you find that funny?
- I understand. We save us.

658
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:09,429
He kill your whole gang from
before you know that he is.

659
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:13,629
Think this through.
Wait effe anders, wait effe anders.

660
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:'s turnover
a tequila with ice.

661
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,395
you understand me?

662
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:24,435
you listen to me?

663
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:26,516
Of course I listen, ok!

664
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:28,113
I make no kidding!

665
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:32,156
I am in a public place.
- Okay, quiet but.

666
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:36,637
He makes everyone. Is that what you want?
- I have a lot of good men.

667
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:39,797
They have pistols,
I have trained them yourself.

668
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:45,040
go there and find my mask. And
then come here. Take me the mask.

669
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,752
Because I want to contribute.

670
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,196
I will put it in my head.

671
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:55,037
I want to contribute.
When I go to the laundry go.

672
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:59,155
people think that I love
because I am a mask wearing.

673
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:07,955
go there and make sure you
are back before he there is. If you do that?

674
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:11,911
You get your mask!
Really! I promise you!

675
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:43,795
We have nothing.

676
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,829
He has done nothing!
- Head close!

677
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:02,520
We have said what it is!
- Head close!

678
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:07,036
I have found it!
Javier, I have found it!

679
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,873
Andrew, the?

680
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:26,875
Unzip the!

681
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:58,115
Shoot!

682
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,550
bring her here! Now!

683
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:34,715
Peanut Butter.

684
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:47,635
