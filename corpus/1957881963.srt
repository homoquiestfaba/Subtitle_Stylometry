00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,826
I've been
dreaming about my wedding

1
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,688
since I was a little girl,

2
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:40,930
ever since my first wedding
to Dante, when we were seven.

3
00:00:40,931 --> 00:00:43,516
He was this cute
scrawny little kid

4
00:00:43,517 --> 00:00:45,619
that lived in my neighborhood.

5
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,826
He had a crush on
me and I thought

6
00:00:47,827 --> 00:00:50,068
he'd be as good of
a husband as any.

7
00:00:52,793 --> 00:00:54,654
I always said I was
gonna have a wedding

8
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:57,241
as beautiful as my
pretend wedding to Dante.

9
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:04,275
♪ Wake up.

10
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,034
♪ It's a brand new day.

11
00:01:06,172 --> 00:01:09,620
♪ Got nothing standing
in my way.

12
00:01:09,724 --> 00:01:15,379
♪ It's looking beautiful
in a whole new way.

13
00:01:15,448 --> 00:01:19,068
♪ Oh, it's time to wake up.

14
00:01:19,137 --> 00:01:23,206
♪ It's time to make a change,
goodbye to yesterday.

15
00:01:23,344 --> 00:01:26,896
♪ I hear my heart saying,
it's going to be ok.

16
00:01:27,034 --> 00:01:28,931
♪ I have enough of tears.

17
00:01:29,068 --> 00:01:34,586
♪ I've had enough of
this, so no more dreaming.

18
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:36,206
♪ Wake up.

19
00:01:36,344 --> 00:01:38,000
♪ It's a brand new day.

20
00:01:38,068 --> 00:01:41,862
♪ Got nothing standing
in my way.

21
00:01:41,931 --> 00:01:44,103
♪ It's looking beautiful...

22
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:46,619
But now I'm grown
and successful,

23
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,205
and I still think about
the wedding sometimes,

24
00:01:49,206 --> 00:01:52,205
but what I think about
mostly is the perfect guy

25
00:01:52,206 --> 00:01:55,447
proposing to me and me
getting my real dream wedding.

26
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,274
The wedding I've been planning
in my head since I was seven.

27
00:01:58,275 --> 00:01:59,930
And I know I'm gonna get it.

28
00:01:59,931 --> 00:02:01,930
I don't know who's
going to give it to me,

29
00:02:01,931 --> 00:02:03,655
but I'm going to get it.

30
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,619
Hey!
Hey, what time is it?

31
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,757
What do you mean
what time it is?

32
00:02:11,758 --> 00:02:12,999
I don't know, I brought
you some coffee.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,931
I gotta go.

34
00:02:13,932 --> 00:02:15,585
What do you mean you gotta go?

35
00:02:15,586 --> 00:02:16,792
Are you not gonna
stay for breakfast?

36
00:02:16,793 --> 00:02:18,240
Baby, I don't
even like breakfast.

37
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:19,585
Since when?

38
00:02:19,586 --> 00:02:20,792
Since always, baby.

39
00:02:20,793 --> 00:02:22,136
What is up?
You're acting weird!

40
00:02:22,137 --> 00:02:23,240
It's gonna be all right.

41
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:24,137
It's gonna be all right.

42
00:02:24,138 --> 00:02:25,343
Oh, you're rushing outta here

43
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:26,585
like I'm some type
of booty call?

44
00:02:26,586 --> 00:02:27,344
Do you like your
flowers, baby?

45
00:02:27,344 --> 00:02:27,965
They're beautiful.

46
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:28,965
Keith?

47
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:30,274
- Yes?
- Where are you going?

48
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,171
Baby, listen, I gotta
go, I gotta go, come on.

49
00:02:32,172 --> 00:02:33,447
- You gotta go?
- Yes, baby.

50
00:02:33,448 --> 00:02:34,930
I don't understand,
didn't we have

51
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:36,412
a good time last night?
Yes, we had a great time.

52
00:02:36,413 --> 00:02:37,964
We had a great time, listen,
I just gotta go, I'm late.

53
00:02:37,965 --> 00:02:39,274
- You're late?
- See you later, come on.

54
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:40,619
Keith!

55
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,274
Keith!
Baby, I'll be back.

56
00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:43,896
What?!

57
00:02:48,413 --> 00:02:49,586
Oh, he gets on my nerves.

58
00:03:00,172 --> 00:03:02,206
Trisha, I can see you!

59
00:03:03,137 --> 00:03:04,793
Open the door, girl.

60
00:03:08,068 --> 00:03:09,964
What's wrong with you?

61
00:03:09,965 --> 00:03:10,965
Keith.

62
00:03:11,655 --> 00:03:13,448
I see.

63
00:03:14,965 --> 00:03:18,378
So I guess him sending
you flowers worked, huh?

64
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:20,723
I thought I was finally done.

65
00:03:20,724 --> 00:03:22,724
Well, did you tell
your lower half?

66
00:03:24,206 --> 00:03:25,206
What happened?

67
00:03:26,482 --> 00:03:28,654
Well, the problem is
that he always expects me

68
00:03:28,655 --> 00:03:32,275
to be there and I want more.

69
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,171
Have you told him this?

70
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:38,379
Yeah, I keep telling
him, but he doesn't get it.

71
00:03:39,827 --> 00:03:43,654
Well, why not just
leave him alone?

72
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:45,206
'Cause my lower
half doesn't want to.

73
00:03:47,482 --> 00:03:49,412
Maybe he's changed.

74
00:03:49,413 --> 00:03:50,965
Maybe he does want more.

75
00:03:54,241 --> 00:03:57,378
What?

76
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:58,792
Keith.

77
00:03:58,793 --> 00:03:59,793
What'd he say?

78
00:04:03,413 --> 00:04:06,205
He said, "I'm sorry I had to
run out on you this morning."

79
00:04:06,206 --> 00:04:07,895
But he ran out on you?

80
00:04:07,896 --> 00:04:08,896
Yeah.

81
00:04:10,586 --> 00:04:12,965
"But I really enjoyed
seeing you last night."

82
00:04:14,551 --> 00:04:16,619
I'd love to take you
out for dinner tonight.

83
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,586
Let's recreate our first date.

84
00:04:20,448 --> 00:04:21,413
I'll meet you there at 8.

85
00:04:21,414 --> 00:04:23,241
"Wear that black dress I like."

86
00:04:25,758 --> 00:04:28,068
You're not gonna believe
what emojis he used.

87
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,895
See, it sounds
like he has changed.

88
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:34,585
Maybe you just need
to give him a chance.

89
00:04:34,586 --> 00:04:36,412
Yeah, maybe you're right.

90
00:04:36,413 --> 00:04:38,240
Maybe he is different.

91
00:04:38,241 --> 00:04:40,688
Ooh, what if he's proposing?

92
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:41,895
Okay, see?

93
00:04:41,896 --> 00:04:43,067
Now you're talking crazy.

94
00:04:43,068 --> 00:04:44,585
You always do this.

95
00:04:44,586 --> 00:04:48,033
Just relax, go have dinner.

96
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:49,688
Nothing more, nothing less.

97
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:50,964
Right.

98
00:04:50,965 --> 00:04:52,792
Relax, right.

99
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,689
Girl, let me go find
that sexy black dress.

100
00:04:57,896 --> 00:04:59,931
Make sure it covers
your lower half.

There was a time
that Keith was really romantic,

115
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,550
and now he wants to
recreate our first date.

116
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:03,343
Maybe he really is
trying to change

117
00:06:03,344 --> 00:06:05,343
and take our relationship
more seriously.

118
00:06:05,344 --> 00:06:07,723
God knows, I've been asking him

119
00:06:07,724 --> 00:06:10,205
and wanting more
of a commitment.

120
00:06:10,206 --> 00:06:13,103
Maybe he's finally
taking me serious.

121
00:06:18,206 --> 00:06:20,862
Yeah, you know, that
was funny as hell.

122
00:06:22,517 --> 00:06:23,550
I liked it.

123
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:25,205
- Yeah.
- It is a nice night.

124
00:06:25,206 --> 00:06:26,654
It is, it is.

125
00:06:26,655 --> 00:06:28,103
You always been kinda silly.

126
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:31,102
Always made me laugh.
That's good.

127
00:06:31,103 --> 00:06:32,826
And I can
appreciate that, you know?

128
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:34,137
Yeah.

129
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:38,034
You look really,
really good, babe.

130
00:06:39,241 --> 00:06:40,826
You look pretty
good too, Keith.

131
00:06:40,827 --> 00:06:42,378
Thank you.

132
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:46,343
Look, I know we've been back
and forth for some time now

133
00:06:46,344 --> 00:06:50,482
and I know you feel like I
never really took us serious.

134
00:06:51,793 --> 00:06:54,724
I want you to know that
that's all changed.

135
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:59,689
I think it's time that
we get serious about us.

136
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,034
Is that right?

137
00:07:03,241 --> 00:07:04,827
Yeah, I'm ready
for the next level.

138
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,654
Trisha?

139
00:07:08,655 --> 00:07:09,655
Yes?

140
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:17,000
I think we should
start dating again.

141
00:07:18,241 --> 00:07:19,688
What?

142
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,655
I think we should
start dating again, baby.

143
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:22,826
Let's do it, I'm ready, baby.

144
00:07:22,827 --> 00:07:23,827
What?

145
00:07:25,068 --> 00:07:27,000
Goodnight, Keith.

146
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:40,585
Hello.

147
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:42,171
Well, how did it go?

148
00:07:42,172 --> 00:07:43,654
It went fine.

149
00:07:43,655 --> 00:07:45,999
Uh-oh, that
doesn't sound good.

150
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,309
What did he say?

151
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,758
He said he wanted
to start dating again.

152
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,654
What else?

153
00:07:51,655 --> 00:07:53,379
That's it, that's all he said.

154
00:07:54,862 --> 00:07:56,964
I thought it would've been
a little bit more than that.

155
00:07:56,965 --> 00:07:58,586
Me too.

156
00:07:59,586 --> 00:08:00,862
Well, what did you say?

157
00:08:01,793 --> 00:08:04,275
Nothing, I was too in shock.

158
00:08:05,482 --> 00:08:06,757
Well, maybe this
is a good thing.

159
00:08:06,758 --> 00:08:09,172
You guys can start fresh
and take your time.

160
00:08:10,586 --> 00:08:12,688
I'm tired of taking my
time, I'm tired of waiting.

161
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:14,378
When is it my turn?

162
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:15,965
It's gonna be your turn soon.

163
00:08:16,862 --> 00:08:18,343
Yeah, right.

164
00:08:18,344 --> 00:08:20,102
You wanna
get together tomorrow?

165
00:08:20,103 --> 00:08:22,999
We could just eat and binge
watch something on Netflix.

166
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,619
I would love to, but my
parents and brother are

167
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,309
coming over for dinner.

168
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,033
Okay, well, call
me this weekend.

169
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:31,171
And, hey, it's gonna be okay.

170
00:08:31,172 --> 00:08:32,000
Love you.

171
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:33,103
Love you, too.

172
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:57,620
Baby, you got it
smelling good already.

173
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,688
I thought you was
gonna help me cook.

174
00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:02,067
Baby, I am helping.

175
00:09:02,068 --> 00:09:03,550
How?

176
00:09:03,551 --> 00:09:05,033
I brought in all the
groceries from the store.

177
00:09:05,034 --> 00:09:06,309
My parents are about
to be here any second now

178
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,964
and I have a lot to do, Keith.

179
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:09,757
You said you was
gonna help me cook.

180
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,447
What do you need help with?

181
00:09:11,448 --> 00:09:13,412
You know what? Forget it.

182
00:09:13,413 --> 00:09:15,412
Baby, you just said you
need help, so I'm asking you,

183
00:09:15,413 --> 00:09:16,723
what do you need help with?

184
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:18,205
I want you to want to help me.

185
00:09:18,206 --> 00:09:19,550
What are you
talking about, Trisha?

186
00:09:19,551 --> 00:09:21,067
You know I don't cook.

187
00:09:21,068 --> 00:09:22,757
See, that's what
I'm talking about.

188
00:09:22,758 --> 00:09:24,033
Are you really getting upset

189
00:09:24,034 --> 00:09:25,240
because I don't
know how to cook?

190
00:09:25,241 --> 00:09:26,481
No, I'm getting upset
because you won't try

191
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:27,619
to make the effort
to help me cook.

192
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,033
I offered to help!

193
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:29,931
Baby.

194
00:09:29,932 --> 00:09:31,274
What?

195
00:09:31,275 --> 00:09:32,447
Why are you doing this again?

196
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:33,723
Doing what?

197
00:09:33,724 --> 00:09:36,033
Always finding
something to fuss about.

198
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:38,378
Look, Keith, I only
asked you to do one thing,

199
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:39,930
one thing today.

200
00:09:39,931 --> 00:09:42,378
Baby, why you trying to
cook all this stuff anyway?

201
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:43,861
I mean, nobody asked
you to do that.

202
00:09:43,862 --> 00:09:45,274
If it was that
serious, I could have

203
00:09:45,275 --> 00:09:47,274
just stopped by the store
and bought some food

204
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:48,930
or either had
someone to cater it.

205
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:50,102
It's not about
the food, Keith.

206
00:09:50,103 --> 00:09:52,378
You said you
needed help cooking.

207
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:53,619
Why don't you get it?

208
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,378
It would be nice if you
did things when I asked.

209
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:58,067
It would be even nice
if you did things

210
00:09:58,068 --> 00:09:59,965
without me having to ask you.

211
00:10:00,896 --> 00:10:02,723
I did something this morning
without you having to ask.

212
00:10:02,724 --> 00:10:04,378
Oh, come on, Keith.

213
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:05,964
I'm being serious.

214
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:07,205
What, babe?

215
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:08,688
You never take
anything serious.

216
00:10:08,689 --> 00:10:09,930
You don't even take me serious.

217
00:10:09,931 --> 00:10:11,412
You just come around
when you want to.

218
00:10:11,413 --> 00:10:12,723
And when you come around,

219
00:10:12,724 --> 00:10:13,895
you don't even pay
me any attention.

220
00:10:13,896 --> 00:10:16,067
Baby, how much
attention do you need?

221
00:10:16,068 --> 00:10:19,550
I mean, I try to come around
more, but it's not enough.

222
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:21,930
I try to do nice things for
you, but it's not enough.

223
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:24,792
I mean, I offer to help,
but it's still not enough.

224
00:10:24,793 --> 00:10:28,136
Nothing I ever do is enough
for you, and it's sickening!

225
00:10:28,137 --> 00:10:30,309
What more do you want from me?

226
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,000
You know what I want?

227
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,205
Forget it.

228
00:10:35,206 --> 00:10:36,206
You know what?

229
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:40,136
I'm done, we're done.

230
00:10:40,137 --> 00:10:41,137
What?

231
00:10:43,137 --> 00:10:44,412
I'm done with this.

232
00:10:44,413 --> 00:10:45,586
I don't deserve this.

233
00:10:47,931 --> 00:10:50,896
I deserve someone who cares.

234
00:10:52,482 --> 00:10:55,136
I'm not spending one more minute

235
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:57,275
with some inconsiderate jerk.

236
00:11:08,517 --> 00:11:10,516
It's really good, pumpkin.

237
00:11:10,517 --> 00:11:11,688
Thanks, dad.

238
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:13,688
- I mean, it's aright.
- Oh, come on.

239
00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:15,205
Is that why your
plate's almost empty?

240
00:11:15,206 --> 00:11:17,585
Well, maybe I didn't
wanna hurt your feelings.

241
00:11:17,586 --> 00:11:18,826
Oh, whatever.

242
00:11:18,827 --> 00:11:20,378
You know you're going
back for seconds.

243
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,861
I think those are thirds.

244
00:11:21,862 --> 00:11:23,654
Yeah, right?

245
00:11:23,655 --> 00:11:25,136
So how's everything with work?

246
00:11:25,137 --> 00:11:26,654
It's good.

247
00:11:26,655 --> 00:11:28,447
Business is booming and I'm
getting new clients every day.

248
00:11:28,448 --> 00:11:30,205
Okay, well, that's a blessing.

249
00:11:30,206 --> 00:11:31,447
Yeah.

250
00:11:31,448 --> 00:11:32,928
How's that crazy
assistant of yours?

251
00:11:34,206 --> 00:11:36,102
Stephanie, she's
crazy, which is good.

252
00:11:36,103 --> 00:11:37,964
Hey, you think she
ever gimme a chance

253
00:11:37,965 --> 00:11:39,964
to really like-
Nope.

254
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:42,205
You know, honey, we
are really proud of you.

255
00:11:42,206 --> 00:11:43,206
We really are.

256
00:11:51,034 --> 00:11:52,034
What?

257
00:11:54,482 --> 00:11:56,619
So, how's dating?

258
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,550
You seeing anybody special?

259
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:02,550
Well, Keith, you know
we off and on again.

260
00:12:02,551 --> 00:12:03,379
Keith?

261
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:04,241
Yeah, Keith.

262
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:05,206
What's wrong with Keith?

263
00:12:05,207 --> 00:12:06,655
- What's right with him?
- Mom!

264
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:09,102
Dad, you feel that way too?

265
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,412
Yeah, if I'm being honest,

266
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:12,102
I never really
cared for the fella.

267
00:12:12,103 --> 00:12:13,516
Really? Why?

268
00:12:13,517 --> 00:12:16,102
He just didn't seem
like he was interested

269
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:18,930
in committing to you,
you know, settling down.

270
00:12:18,931 --> 00:12:21,412
No, Keith and I are thinking
about getting married.

271
00:12:21,413 --> 00:12:23,206
Girl, ain't nobody
gonna marry you.

272
00:12:24,586 --> 00:12:26,930
Yeah, I'm not
getting any younger.

273
00:12:26,931 --> 00:12:28,585
Yeah, If that ain't the truth.

274
00:12:28,586 --> 00:12:29,930
Listen, baby girl.

275
00:12:29,931 --> 00:12:31,861
Don't even worry about him.

276
00:12:31,862 --> 00:12:34,550
I know you thought
you'd be married by now.

277
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:35,655
I mean, I know I did.

278
00:12:37,241 --> 00:12:40,723
You know, as a kid, you spent
almost every day after school

279
00:12:40,724 --> 00:12:43,033
talking and planning
your wedding.

280
00:12:43,034 --> 00:12:45,551
I mean, you were obsessed
with getting married!

281
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:48,792
Just give it some time.

282
00:12:48,793 --> 00:12:50,412
You will meet the
right one soon enough.

283
00:12:50,413 --> 00:12:52,757
Oh, oh, oh,
speaking of, honey.

284
00:12:52,758 --> 00:12:56,102
I know somebody who
might be good for you.

285
00:12:56,103 --> 00:12:57,619
Dad!

286
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,757
The only way you gonna
get somebody to marry you

287
00:12:58,758 --> 00:13:00,482
is if you pay him to do it.

288
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:02,964
Ah, ma!

289
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:04,034
That's what you get.

290
00:13:05,413 --> 00:13:06,619
No, seriously, honey.

291
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,586
You remember that
fella you tried

292
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:08,895
to marry when you were a kid?

293
00:13:08,896 --> 00:13:10,550
I ran into him,
and you know what?

294
00:13:10,551 --> 00:13:12,723
He asked about you.

295
00:13:12,724 --> 00:13:13,724
Yes, he did, he did!

296
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:15,240
No, no, no, no, no.

used to drink his own spit?

Yep, that's the one.

00:15:37,931 --> 00:15:39,447
Look at this one.

357
00:15:39,448 --> 00:15:40,964
Let me see, let
me see, let me see.

358
00:15:40,965 --> 00:15:43,585
What do we have,
what do we have?

359
00:15:43,586 --> 00:15:44,931
Ooh, what about this one?

360
00:15:45,896 --> 00:15:48,378
Mm! Yes!

361
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:50,067
Most definitely put
him on the list.

362
00:15:50,068 --> 00:15:51,792
- Gotcha.
- He's a good one.

363
00:15:51,793 --> 00:15:52,793
How many is that?

364
00:15:53,862 --> 00:15:58,274
One, two, I don't know,
I lost count.

365
00:15:58,275 --> 00:15:59,516
Ooh!

366
00:15:59,517 --> 00:16:00,517
What?

367
00:16:01,655 --> 00:16:02,758
This one right here.

368
00:16:04,103 --> 00:16:07,102
Oh, he is definitely
going on the list.

369
00:16:07,103 --> 00:16:08,481
Especially his lower half.

370
00:16:08,482 --> 00:16:10,516
Yes, I see it.

371
00:16:10,517 --> 00:16:12,481
I can't believe
you doing this, girl.

372
00:16:12,482 --> 00:16:14,723
I'm just tired of waiting.

373
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,137
I wanna get married, I want
a big, beautiful wedding.

374
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:20,275
Ooh!

375
00:16:21,758 --> 00:16:23,447
I could definitely marry him.

376
00:16:23,448 --> 00:16:24,965
Let me see that.

377
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:30,379
What is it?

378
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,619
Keith.
Oh, Keith.

379
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,274
Yes, girl, he's
called me like 20 times,

380
00:16:33,275 --> 00:16:34,688
but I'm definitely done.

381
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:36,343
I'm done with you!

382
00:16:36,344 --> 00:16:39,241
Yes, Keith, I'm done!

383
00:16:40,689 --> 00:16:42,412
All right, all right, let's
look through some more.

384
00:16:42,413 --> 00:16:43,413
Let me see.

385
00:16:44,793 --> 00:16:46,620
You know you have
some women in here?

386
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,137
Are they cute?

387
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,310
Well...

388
00:16:56,862 --> 00:16:59,826
Oh, you know, you
can't really do this, right?

389
00:16:59,827 --> 00:17:00,827
Do what?

390
00:17:00,931 --> 00:17:02,447
This is crazy!

391
00:17:02,448 --> 00:17:04,067
You're talking about meeting
random strangers at a bar.

392
00:17:04,068 --> 00:17:05,930
Girl, it's actually
a restaurant.

393
00:17:05,931 --> 00:17:08,930
Oh, I'm gonna record saying
how insane this is right now.

394
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:11,688
Just promise
you won't tell anyone.

395
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:16,034
Trisha, I don't know who
would believe me.

396
00:17:22,206 --> 00:17:23,172
What you gonna wear?

397
00:17:23,173 --> 00:17:24,862

00:18:34,068 --> 00:18:36,723
Okay, now I'm
having second thoughts.

425
00:18:36,724 --> 00:18:38,136
What am I doing?

426
00:18:38,137 --> 00:18:39,585
Maybe this isn't a good idea.

427
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,309
I should get out of here.

428
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,516
Excuse me.

429
00:18:42,517 --> 00:18:44,309
No, I can't handle
any more dates tonight.

430
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,930
No, well, my name is Carter,

431
00:18:47,931 --> 00:18:50,551
and I didn't mean to
startle you, okay?

432
00:18:51,793 --> 00:18:53,688
But I've been watching you
and I just have to ask,

433
00:18:53,689 --> 00:18:55,309
what is a beautiful
woman like you

434
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:58,102
doing speed dating in a bar?

435
00:18:58,103 --> 00:18:59,792
Well, I wouldn't be,
if the guy I used to date

436
00:18:59,793 --> 00:19:01,999
would just marry me already.

437
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,343
Interesting.

438
00:19:03,344 --> 00:19:06,171
Well, I may have a
proposition for you.

439
00:19:06,172 --> 00:19:07,482
What kind of proposition?

440
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,792
My boss is
looking for a bride.

441
00:19:11,793 --> 00:19:13,826
Maybe I can
introduce you to him.

442
00:19:13,827 --> 00:19:15,999
A bride? Why?

443
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,688
Who is your boss?

444
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,550
His name is Benjamin Sanders.

445
00:19:19,551 --> 00:19:22,343
His family owns a
technology firm.

446
00:19:22,344 --> 00:19:23,826
I'm his assistant.

447
00:19:23,827 --> 00:19:25,723
Is your boss hiding
from the FBI or something?

448
00:19:25,724 --> 00:19:27,964
No, he's just a regular guy.

449
00:19:27,965 --> 00:19:30,516
Sure, a regular
guy looking to marry

450
00:19:30,517 --> 00:19:31,792
a random girl he's never met?

451
00:19:31,793 --> 00:19:34,033
Well, that's funny.

452
00:19:34,034 --> 00:19:35,516
What's so funny?

453
00:19:35,517 --> 00:19:37,999
Well, the irony, for one.

454
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,343
I mean, aren't you
looking to date

455
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,999
some random guy
you've never met?

456
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Touche!

457
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,481
Look, trust me.
What?

458
00:19:45,482 --> 00:19:46,688
He needs this.

459
00:19:46,689 --> 00:19:49,067
And it will be a lot
of money in it for you.

460
00:19:49,068 --> 00:19:50,310
Could be a win-win.

461
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,171
Besides, who wouldn't
wanna be married

462
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:54,655
to a beautiful woman like you?

463
00:19:57,448 --> 00:19:58,723
Think about it.

464
00:19:58,724 --> 00:20:00,000
Let me know.

465
00:20:18,241 --> 00:20:20,033
- Hello.
- Hey, so how'd it go?

466
00:20:20,034 --> 00:20:21,309
Any good ones?

467
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,861
Actually, there was
quite a few good ones,

468
00:20:22,862 --> 00:20:24,654
but you're not
gonna believe this.

469
00:20:24,655 --> 00:20:26,136
What?

470
00:20:26,137 --> 00:20:28,033
So this guy comes up
to me with a proposition,

471
00:20:28,034 --> 00:20:30,688
and he says his rich boss
is looking for a bride.

472
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:32,067
What? Why?

473
00:20:32,068 --> 00:20:34,240
I don't know, he wouldn't say.

474
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:35,895
Are you gonna do it?

475
00:20:35,896 --> 00:20:37,240
I don't know.

476
00:20:37,241 --> 00:20:38,654
I don't even know what
the guy looks like.

477
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:40,619
All I got was his name.

478
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,620
What's his name?

479
00:20:42,827 --> 00:20:45,136
Benjamin Sanders.

480
00:20:45,137 --> 00:20:48,067
Hold on, let me see.

481
00:20:48,068 --> 00:20:49,792
Does he work for a
huge tech company?

482
00:20:49,793 --> 00:20:51,412
Yes, how did you know that?

483
00:20:51,413 --> 00:20:54,000
Because it says so right
here next to his picture.

484
00:20:54,896 --> 00:20:56,240
He's really cute.

485
00:20:56,241 --> 00:20:57,516
He's smart too.

486
00:20:57,517 --> 00:20:59,412
You know, technology is
a good field to be in.

487
00:20:59,413 --> 00:21:00,516
Maybe I should marry him.

488
00:21:00,517 --> 00:21:02,585
Girl, stop.

489
00:21:02,586 --> 00:21:04,792
I still can't believe
you're doing this.

490
00:21:04,793 --> 00:21:06,619
Well, you didn't
tell anyone, did you?

491
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,586
Who would I tell?

492
00:21:07,587 --> 00:21:09,481
We don't have any other friends.

493
00:21:09,482 --> 00:21:11,136
You're really serious.

494
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:12,654
I don't know.

495
00:21:12,655 --> 00:21:15,826
Maybe I should set up a
dinner with him tomorrow.

496
00:21:15,827 --> 00:21:17,274
Well, do you need
me to stop by to check

497
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:19,826
and make sure you
aren't kidnapped?

498
00:21:19,827 --> 00:21:21,619
Girl, he's not
going to kidnap me.

499
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,413
Mm-hm, okay.

500
00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:25,275
You know what?

501
00:21:25,276 --> 00:21:26,862
Okay, call me.

502
00:21:41,379 --> 00:21:42,379
Trisha, right?

503
00:21:44,758 --> 00:21:46,757
Ben, right?

504
00:21:46,758 --> 00:21:48,481
You look just like your picture.

505
00:21:48,482 --> 00:21:50,102
So Carter showed
you my pictures?

506
00:21:50,103 --> 00:21:51,103
Uh-huh.

507
00:21:52,689 --> 00:21:53,758
Like your flowers?

508
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:56,896
Yeah, I like them.

509
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,517
And I like the line too.

510
00:22:00,965 --> 00:22:02,964
If you hear my phone ring,
it's my best friend Stephanie.

511
00:22:02,965 --> 00:22:05,172
She's making sure you're
not a serial killer.

512
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:08,861
Let me ask you a question.

513
00:22:08,862 --> 00:22:10,309
What?

514
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:13,481
Tell me why is it that someone
as beautiful as you are

515
00:22:13,482 --> 00:22:14,482
still single?

516
00:22:15,724 --> 00:22:17,343
Well, I've been waiting
all my life to have

517
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:20,999
the perfect wedding and
the perfect marriage,

518
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,413
but I guess life has
different plans for me.

519
00:22:25,551 --> 00:22:27,275
You could still have
a perfect wedding.

520
00:22:28,206 --> 00:22:29,034
Really?

521
00:22:29,035 --> 00:22:30,448
Yeah, marry me.

522
00:22:31,931 --> 00:22:33,171
That's crazy.

523
00:22:33,172 --> 00:22:34,205
Nah, that's not crazy.

524
00:22:34,206 --> 00:22:35,930
Here's what I know about crazy.

525
00:22:35,931 --> 00:22:38,688
What I know about crazy
is women are crazy,

526
00:22:38,689 --> 00:22:40,274
and men are stupid.

527
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,757
And the reason that
women are crazy is

528
00:22:41,758 --> 00:22:43,620
because men are stupid.

529
00:22:44,517 --> 00:22:46,240
Yeah, ain't that the truth?

530
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:47,550
Yeah.

531
00:22:47,551 --> 00:22:48,792
My friend Stephanie
thinks I'm crazy,

532
00:22:48,793 --> 00:22:50,861
but I don't know, maybe I am.

533
00:22:50,862 --> 00:22:52,378
Why?

534
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:56,033
No, you should always do
what makes you happy, okay?

535
00:22:56,034 --> 00:22:58,516
And if having a perfect
wedding makes you happy,

536
00:22:58,517 --> 00:23:00,723
then I say do it.

537
00:23:00,724 --> 00:23:02,068
- Really?
- Yep.

538
00:23:03,724 --> 00:23:07,000
So much so, I brought you this.

539
00:23:08,379 --> 00:23:09,275
What's this?

540
00:23:09,276 --> 00:23:10,758
It's just a simple prenup.

541
00:23:14,758 --> 00:23:16,757
It says you'll pay me $500,000

542
00:23:16,758 --> 00:23:18,757
to be married to you for a year.

543
00:23:18,758 --> 00:23:21,516
Nothing else more?
Nothing more, nothing less.

544
00:23:21,517 --> 00:23:22,792
Look, I'm just like you.

545
00:23:22,793 --> 00:23:24,619
I'm tired of looking
for Miss Perfect.

546
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,102
The only thing is if I
don't get married soon,

547
00:23:27,103 --> 00:23:28,792
I lose my inheritance.

548
00:23:28,793 --> 00:23:31,067
Look, we both can get what
we want off this deal, right?

549
00:23:31,068 --> 00:23:33,033
And then we can go ahead
on and live our lives.

550
00:23:33,034 --> 00:23:35,585
Okay, so why don't you pay
me a million dollars then?

551
00:23:35,586 --> 00:23:37,067
Done.

552
00:23:37,068 --> 00:23:38,034
Really?

553
00:23:38,034 --> 00:23:39,034
Yeah.

554
00:23:39,827 --> 00:23:41,447
And you'll pay for everything?

555
00:23:41,448 --> 00:23:43,274
Everything, whatever you want.

556
00:23:43,275 --> 00:23:45,102
This sounds too
good to be true.

557
00:23:45,103 --> 00:23:46,654
I gotta see if you're some kind

558
00:23:46,655 --> 00:23:48,102
of crazy criminal or something.

559
00:23:48,103 --> 00:23:50,999
Listen, I'll have my
assistant give you a call,

560
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,102
give you everything you need.

561
00:23:53,103 --> 00:23:55,930
Okay, well, tell me a little
bit more about yourself.

562
00:23:55,931 --> 00:23:57,516
Well, I-

563
00:23:57,517 --> 00:23:58,930
- Trisha!

564
00:23:58,931 --> 00:24:01,343
Oh my God, that's my brother.

565
00:24:01,344 --> 00:24:02,654
What are you doing here?

566
00:24:02,655 --> 00:24:04,688
Hey, what you mean?
I'm a here for dinner.

567
00:24:04,689 --> 00:24:06,171
Wait, you didn't
get my voicemail?

568
00:24:06,172 --> 00:24:08,551
Girl, you know, I don't
be checking my messages.

569
00:24:09,793 --> 00:24:11,240
Mom and dad didn't tell you?

570
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,930
No, they don't
talk to me much.

571
00:24:12,931 --> 00:24:15,723
Dinner plans have
been canceled, JJ.

572
00:24:15,724 --> 00:24:17,895
Well, I can see that.

573
00:24:17,896 --> 00:24:19,068
'Cause that ain't Keith.

574
00:24:20,172 --> 00:24:21,654
Who's Keith?

575
00:24:21,655 --> 00:24:23,793
He don't know about Keith?

576
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Hey, that's none
of your business.

577
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:27,654
Wait, none of my business?

578
00:24:27,655 --> 00:24:28,861
I mean, it's all my business

579
00:24:28,862 --> 00:24:30,585
when you got this
strange man over here.

580
00:24:30,586 --> 00:24:32,033
Hey, this is my house!

581
00:24:32,034 --> 00:24:33,481
I swear you shouldn't be
asking me questions like that.

582
00:24:33,482 --> 00:24:34,826
- Ooh.
- You gotta go.

583
00:24:34,827 --> 00:24:36,343
- Oh so you gonna kick me out?
- Yes.

584
00:24:36,344 --> 00:24:37,895
When I'm over here, just
trying to look out for you?

585
00:24:37,896 --> 00:24:39,136
Bye.

586
00:24:39,137 --> 00:24:40,171
Can I just at least
get like a sandwich

587
00:24:40,172 --> 00:24:41,688
or something please?
Bye.

588
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:44,481
Oh my God, I'm
telling mom and dad.

589
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:45,482
Whoa!

590
00:24:47,931 --> 00:24:48,827
You know, I have sisters too,

591
00:24:48,828 --> 00:24:50,448
and they always in my business.

592
00:24:51,655 --> 00:24:53,619
You really think
he gon' tell them?

593
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,067
He's definitely
telling mom and dad.

594
00:24:56,068 --> 00:24:58,379
Yeah, he looks
like he's gonna tell.

595
00:25:02,896 --> 00:25:05,136
Hey, just
giving you another call

596
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:06,412
to make sure you're alive,

597
00:25:06,413 --> 00:25:08,895
and not tied up in his
basement or something.

598
00:25:08,896 --> 00:25:10,826
I just wanna tell
you that I don't appreciate

599
00:25:10,827 --> 00:25:12,412
the way you kicked
me out earlier.

600
00:25:12,413 --> 00:25:14,481
It was rude and I was hungry.

601
00:25:14,482 --> 00:25:16,067
Hi sweetie, it's mom.

602
00:25:16,068 --> 00:25:18,585
I just got a weird
text from your brother.

603
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:20,999
Something about a strange
man at your place.

604
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,343
I really couldn't make it
out, just call me, okay?

605
00:25:23,344 --> 00:25:25,033
Is there
some man in your house?

606
00:25:25,034 --> 00:25:26,550
Do I need to come over there?

607
00:25:26,551 --> 00:25:27,826
You just can't
go barge in over there.

608
00:25:27,827 --> 00:25:29,550
I can if some man is there.

609
00:25:29,551 --> 00:25:30,688
I'm going over there.

610
00:25:30,689 --> 00:25:32,412
Call JJ.
Leave her alone.

611
00:25:32,413 --> 00:25:36,240
Mm-hm, look, I told
you I was gonna tell them,

612
00:25:36,241 --> 00:25:38,309
and that's what you
get for not feeding me.

613
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:41,275
And I'm coming over
tomorrow for leftovers.

614
00:25:46,206 --> 00:25:47,861
Hey, why
didn't you call me back?

615
00:25:47,862 --> 00:25:48,999
I was worried.

616
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,171
Sorry I didn't call you back.

617
00:25:50,172 --> 00:25:51,619
Just busy.

618
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,240
What is all of this?

619
00:25:53,241 --> 00:25:54,895
These are my wedding options.

620
00:25:54,896 --> 00:25:56,412
Sit.

621
00:25:56,413 --> 00:25:57,792
Okay, tell me
you're not about to do

622
00:25:57,793 --> 00:25:59,067
what I think you're doing.

623
00:25:59,068 --> 00:26:00,895
Yep, I'm getting married,

624
00:26:00,896 --> 00:26:03,930
and the wedding's gonna be
everything I dreamed of.

625
00:26:03,931 --> 00:26:06,378
You have officially
lost your mind.

626
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:08,930
Yeah, well, at least
Ben knows what he wants,

627
00:26:08,931 --> 00:26:09,862
and Keith, I'm
just tired of him.

628
00:26:09,863 --> 00:26:12,136
I'm ready to move on.

629
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:14,205
What are you gonna
tell your parents?

630
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:15,619
What is he gonna
tell his family?

631
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,964
I don't know.

632
00:26:16,965 --> 00:26:18,930
I haven't thought that far yet.

633
00:26:18,931 --> 00:26:21,758
Oh, look at this contract.

634
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,309
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hm.

635
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:29,309
He's really gonna pay
you this much to marry him?

636
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,654
Yeah, he's paying
for everything.

637
00:26:31,655 --> 00:26:33,344
That's why I need
your help, Steph.

638
00:26:34,586 --> 00:26:36,619
You know this is a
fake wedding, right?

639
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,309
Yeah, it's fake,
but it doesn't make it

640
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,964
any less stressful.

641
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,723
- Okay, let's do it, but,
- What?

642
00:26:41,724 --> 00:26:44,412
I'm charging premium since
your fiance's paying for it.

643
00:26:44,413 --> 00:26:46,585
Hey, charge whatever you
want, we got the money!

644
00:26:46,586 --> 00:26:48,585
- Ooh, okay.
- Try this cake.

645
00:26:48,586 --> 00:26:51,034
- It's good, right?
- Where's the chocolate?

We have the buttercup,

683
00:28:36,413 --> 00:28:38,343
the stephanie floribunda,

684
00:28:38,344 --> 00:28:40,102
ooh, look at the lily of valley.

685
00:28:40,103 --> 00:28:42,102
How about we just
get whatever you want?

686
00:28:42,103 --> 00:28:43,826
I mean, hell, we can
just buy all of them.

687
00:28:43,827 --> 00:28:45,343
It's not about that.

688
00:28:45,344 --> 00:28:47,585
I just thought we
could choose together.

689
00:28:47,586 --> 00:28:50,723
Maybe we can find something
that you like a little bit,

690
00:28:50,724 --> 00:28:51,930
I like a little bit-

691
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:53,217
- Let me take this,
give me a second.

692
00:28:53,241 --> 00:28:54,241
What?

693
00:28:56,655 --> 00:28:58,274
You know what, Trisha?

694
00:28:58,275 --> 00:29:00,274
I know that you want this
to be the perfect wedding,

695
00:29:00,275 --> 00:29:04,343
so how about we let the
professionals take care of it?

696
00:29:04,344 --> 00:29:06,240
I spoke with the top
wedding planner in the state

697
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:10,309
and she agreed to come in and
take over the whole thing.

698
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,310
It's great, right?

699
00:29:12,827 --> 00:29:13,827
I don't know, Ben.

700
00:29:14,931 --> 00:29:17,827
Come on, trust me.

701
00:29:19,827 --> 00:29:20,827
Okay?

702
00:29:23,482 --> 00:29:25,067
No.

703
00:29:25,068 --> 00:29:26,171
No what?

704
00:29:26,172 --> 00:29:27,688
No, that's not what I want.

705
00:29:27,689 --> 00:29:29,826
You promised me I can plan
the wedding that I want,

706
00:29:29,827 --> 00:29:31,067
and what I want is to plan

707
00:29:31,068 --> 00:29:32,481
the wedding that
I'm supposed to plan

708
00:29:32,482 --> 00:29:34,067
with the man I'm
supposed to marry.

709
00:29:34,068 --> 00:29:35,757
So are you gonna help
me choose or not?

710
00:29:35,758 --> 00:29:36,758
Fine.

711
00:29:37,517 --> 00:29:38,724
Call you in the morning.

712
00:30:05,241 --> 00:30:06,172
Hey.

713
00:30:06,173 --> 00:30:07,310
What you doing?

714
00:30:08,517 --> 00:30:10,137
Girl, it's seven
in the morning.

715
00:30:11,344 --> 00:30:13,723
You have any plans today?

716
00:30:13,724 --> 00:30:15,447
Yeah, I gotta meet Ben today

717
00:30:15,448 --> 00:30:16,999
to go get fitted for his suit.

718
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,550
Oh, well, call me later.

719
00:30:20,551 --> 00:30:21,723
Okay.

720
00:30:21,724 --> 00:30:22,586
Bye.

721
00:30:22,586 --> 00:30:23,586
Bye.

722
00:30:42,586 --> 00:30:43,448
What are you doing here?

723
00:30:43,449 --> 00:30:44,999
I'm here for you.

724
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,171
Ben sent me.

725
00:30:46,172 --> 00:30:47,447
He what?

726
00:30:47,448 --> 00:30:49,171
Yeah, he's busy
with a meeting.

727
00:30:49,172 --> 00:30:50,723
So he sent me to handle
all the wedding stuff.

728
00:30:50,724 --> 00:30:51,620
No, he didn't.

729
00:30:51,621 --> 00:30:53,067
It's fine, really.

730
00:30:53,068 --> 00:30:54,792
He's supposed to get
fitted for the suit.

731
00:30:54,793 --> 00:30:55,964
If that's all
you're worried about,

732
00:30:55,965 --> 00:30:57,619
- Yes.
- Then we're in luck.

733
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,136
Look, he doesn't do
anything for himself.

734
00:30:59,137 --> 00:31:00,516
I buy all his suits for work.

735
00:31:00,517 --> 00:31:01,895
It's gonna be fine, come on.

736
00:31:01,896 --> 00:31:03,067
Oh, this doesn't make sense.

737
00:31:03,068 --> 00:31:05,517
It'll be fine, trust me.

738
00:31:12,034 --> 00:31:13,826
Please record your message.

739
00:31:13,827 --> 00:31:16,655
Trisha, answer the phone,
I know you see me calling!

740
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,309
I don't understand why.

741
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,103
Just answer the phone!

742
00:31:30,517 --> 00:31:31,723
Vanilla.

743
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:33,723
Vanilla, this is good.

744
00:31:33,724 --> 00:31:34,964
See?

745
00:31:34,965 --> 00:31:36,412
Wasn't that bad hanging
out with me, was it?

746
00:31:36,413 --> 00:31:38,723
No, it wasn't that bad.

747
00:31:38,724 --> 00:31:40,481
But, Carter, I
wish Ben was here.

748
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,240
He just doesn't
seem so interested.

749
00:31:42,241 --> 00:31:43,826
No, no, he's interested.

750
00:31:43,827 --> 00:31:45,447
He's just really busy with
his business, that's all.

751
00:31:45,448 --> 00:31:46,723
Oh, okay.

752
00:31:46,724 --> 00:31:48,171
Thanks for coming along.

753
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:49,826
Not a problem,
you're good company.

754
00:31:49,827 --> 00:31:51,067
- Am I?
- Mm-hm.

755
00:31:51,068 --> 00:31:52,378
Thank you.

756
00:31:52,379 --> 00:31:53,481
All right, see you tomorrow.

757
00:31:53,482 --> 00:31:54,723
See you tomorrow.

758
00:31:54,724 --> 00:31:57,550
Oh, and tell Ben
don't be late tonight.

759
00:31:57,551 --> 00:31:58,551
Got it.

760
00:32:06,517 --> 00:32:07,861
Hey.

761
00:32:07,862 --> 00:32:09,102
I'm here, sorry I'm late.

762
00:32:09,103 --> 00:32:10,964
- So glad you could make it.
- Yeah.

763
00:32:10,965 --> 00:32:13,481
I thought you were
gonna send Carter.

764
00:32:13,482 --> 00:32:14,619
Can you put your phone away?

765
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,826
No, I'm sorry.

766
00:32:15,827 --> 00:32:17,447
It's just some business
stuff, that's all.

767
00:32:17,448 --> 00:32:19,378
I don't care what it is,
but put your phone away

768
00:32:19,379 --> 00:32:21,240
at least until we have
dinner with my parents.

769
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:23,550
Okay, my bad, phone away.

770
00:32:23,551 --> 00:32:25,067
Hey, I almost forgot.

771
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,068
What?

772
00:32:27,137 --> 00:32:28,965
- You got a ring?
- Yeah.

773
00:32:31,137 --> 00:32:32,861
Here.
It looks gorgeous.

774
00:32:32,862 --> 00:32:35,447
Yeah, hey, you
wanna try it on now?

775
00:32:35,448 --> 00:32:36,723
Well, maybe-

776
00:32:36,724 --> 00:32:37,379
- Gotta make it look
real, right? So...

777
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,895
I don't know.

778
00:32:38,896 --> 00:32:42,447
We should wait 'till my
parents find out about us.

779
00:32:42,448 --> 00:32:43,448
Okay.

780
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,136
You nervous?

781
00:32:46,137 --> 00:32:47,688
Yeah, I'm nervous.

782
00:32:47,689 --> 00:32:48,517
Don't be nervous.

783
00:32:48,517 --> 00:32:49,379
Well, I'm nervous.

784
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,930
It's gonna be okay.

785
00:32:50,931 --> 00:32:54,309
Let's just go over what we
went over and we'll be fine.

786
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,620
- Okay, all right.
- Come on.

787
00:33:02,724 --> 00:33:05,862
Trisha here, with
this strange man.

788
00:33:07,448 --> 00:33:08,448
Come on.

789
00:33:11,034 --> 00:33:12,103
What's up, lil' man?

790
00:33:31,344 --> 00:33:33,033
Everything good, mom?

791
00:33:33,034 --> 00:33:34,517
Dinner will be ready shortly.

792
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:37,861
You have a beautiful
house, Misses Sinclair.

793
00:33:37,862 --> 00:33:38,862
Thank you.

794
00:33:43,137 --> 00:33:44,826
What'd you say your name was?

795
00:33:44,827 --> 00:33:47,033
It's Ben, Benjamin.

796
00:33:47,034 --> 00:33:48,620
What type of name is Benjamin?

797
00:33:52,034 --> 00:33:53,654
So how'd you two meet?

798
00:33:53,655 --> 00:33:57,103
Oh, we met in college at...

799
00:33:58,517 --> 00:33:59,861
We dated for a little bit.

800
00:33:59,862 --> 00:34:01,205
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

801
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,412
We ain't never heard
nothing about you.

802
00:34:02,413 --> 00:34:05,102
Yeah, we both were
really into our studies,

803
00:34:05,103 --> 00:34:06,585
but then came across
each other later,

804
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,688
and the rest is history.

805
00:34:07,689 --> 00:34:08,931
Oh, where?

806
00:34:09,931 --> 00:34:11,861
Oh, it doesn't matter where.

807
00:34:11,862 --> 00:34:12,930
So Ben, what do you do?

808
00:34:12,931 --> 00:34:17,067
I work at a
technology firm, coding.

809
00:34:17,068 --> 00:34:18,000
Oh!

810
00:34:18,001 --> 00:34:19,343
So you can hack into things?

811
00:34:19,344 --> 00:34:21,033
'Cause I got this new computer.

812
00:34:21,034 --> 00:34:24,172
JJ, he's not hacking into
anything for you tonight.

813
00:34:25,344 --> 00:34:27,274
Well, that sounds interesting.

814
00:34:27,275 --> 00:34:29,862
So you two said you
had something to tell us.

815
00:34:31,931 --> 00:34:33,241
We're getting married.

816
00:34:35,517 --> 00:34:37,550
You marrying this strange man?

817
00:34:37,551 --> 00:34:38,654
He's not a strange man.

818
00:34:38,655 --> 00:34:40,274
You getting married?

819
00:34:40,275 --> 00:34:41,412
Yes, mom.

820
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:42,344
We're getting married.

821
00:34:42,345 --> 00:34:44,654
- Oh, Jesus.
- Wait a minute.

822
00:34:44,655 --> 00:34:46,241
You two said you just dated.

823
00:34:48,206 --> 00:34:51,895
Yeah, well, we feel
like it's so much more.

824
00:34:51,896 --> 00:34:53,723
Yeah, we do.

825
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:55,033
Mr. Benjamin.

826
00:34:55,034 --> 00:34:56,102
Yes, sir.

827
00:34:56,103 --> 00:34:57,412
- Let's talk.
- Yeah, yeah.

828
00:34:57,413 --> 00:34:59,585
We need to have a real-
Alone.

829
00:34:59,586 --> 00:35:02,068
Sweetheart, please.

830
00:35:02,172 --> 00:35:03,172
Yes.

831
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:09,757
Sweetie, can we just talk-

832
00:35:09,758 --> 00:35:11,654
- I already know what
you're gonna say, mom.

833
00:35:11,655 --> 00:35:13,171
And what's that?

834
00:35:13,172 --> 00:35:14,999
That I'm moving too fast
and we just started dating.

835
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,309
Right?

836
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:18,171
Are you sure you're
not rushing into this?

837
00:35:18,172 --> 00:35:19,172
I'm sure.

838
00:35:20,241 --> 00:35:22,033
This is what I want,
I wanna be married.

839
00:35:22,034 --> 00:35:25,171
I know you do, but I
don't want you to regret it

840
00:35:25,172 --> 00:35:27,274
if it's not with
the right person.

841
00:35:27,275 --> 00:35:28,826
You know, it should
be with your soulmate.

842
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:30,102
Is Ben your soulmate?

843
00:35:30,103 --> 00:35:31,516
All right, now, you
listen here, young lady.

844
00:35:31,517 --> 00:35:33,171
Mom and I need to have
a serious talk with you.

845
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,757
It is unacceptable!
Son, son?

846
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:36,481
- JJ, just go.
- But mom,

847
00:35:36,482 --> 00:35:37,757
- Go!
- You're not gonna yell at-

848
00:35:37,758 --> 00:35:38,999
- Nobody's yelling
at anyone, now go.

849
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,586
Just go, oh my God.

850
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,758
Your brother's just too much.

851
00:35:47,655 --> 00:35:48,655
So Ben.

852
00:35:49,724 --> 00:35:51,171
Yes, sir.

853
00:35:51,172 --> 00:35:52,481
Technology, huh?

854
00:35:52,482 --> 00:35:53,688
Yep.

855
00:35:53,689 --> 00:35:55,999
You must be a
pretty smart fella.

856
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Yeah, I guess
you can say that.

857
00:35:59,517 --> 00:36:03,309
So the smart fella would
usually come to the father first

858
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:06,206
and ask for the daughter's
hand in marriage.

859
00:36:07,517 --> 00:36:09,067
You're right, sir.

860
00:36:09,068 --> 00:36:10,378
That is usually how it goes,

861
00:36:10,379 --> 00:36:13,585
but you have an
amazing daughter.

862
00:36:13,586 --> 00:36:17,516
She's beautiful, bright,
ambitious, great personality.

863
00:36:17,517 --> 00:36:20,344
I just couldn't wait any longer
to ask her to be my wife.

864
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:25,067
Well, this isn't how I
would've wanted it to go,

865
00:36:25,068 --> 00:36:29,689
but if she's happy, I'm happy.

866
00:36:32,206 --> 00:36:33,551
Thank you, sir.

867
00:36:36,655 --> 00:36:38,826
Yes, I'm glad we
had a chance to talk.

868
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:41,136
Good to meet you.
Yeah, likewise, sir.

869
00:36:41,137 --> 00:36:43,310
- Happy life.
- Yeah, it's the plan.

870
00:36:44,758 --> 00:36:46,205
You two had a good chat?

871
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:47,206
We did.

872
00:36:48,241 --> 00:36:49,274
I'll meet you by the car.

873
00:36:49,275 --> 00:36:50,343
Okay.

874
00:36:50,344 --> 00:36:51,516
It was nice meeting you.
You too.

875
00:36:51,517 --> 00:36:52,724
Take care.
Likewise.

876
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,826
I want you guys to know
that I, don't worry about me.

877
00:36:55,827 --> 00:36:56,827
I'm happy, okay?

878
00:37:16,206 --> 00:37:19,274
We offer a lot of custom
linings, London fog,

879
00:37:19,275 --> 00:37:22,412
and a lot of signature
threads that we only offer.

880
00:37:22,413 --> 00:37:25,067
We would like you to check
out some of our ideas

881
00:37:25,068 --> 00:37:26,275
and hope you like those.

882
00:37:28,206 --> 00:37:30,586
Ooh, nice.

883
00:37:32,586 --> 00:37:35,309
Ah, what do you
think about this one?

884
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,137
Which ones?

885
00:37:36,138 --> 00:37:37,343
Doesn't matter, baby.

886
00:37:37,344 --> 00:37:38,310
Which one?

887
00:37:38,311 --> 00:37:39,895
Which ones do you like?

888
00:37:39,896 --> 00:37:41,964
Well, it really
doesn't matter.

889
00:37:41,965 --> 00:37:43,930
But babe, we have to decide.

890
00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:47,136
And I'm allergic to the flowers
you picked the other day.

891
00:37:47,137 --> 00:37:49,862
We talked about the flowers
a million and one times.

892
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,895
You know what?

893
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,550
We'll decide later.

894
00:37:55,551 --> 00:37:56,482
Thanks for coming.

895
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:57,930
All right, thanks, no problem.

896
00:37:57,931 --> 00:37:59,309
You have a great day.

897
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,310
Yeah, you too.

898
00:38:03,517 --> 00:38:05,205
Hey, hey!

899
00:38:05,206 --> 00:38:06,034
Hey.

900
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:07,447
Back with the food.

901
00:38:07,448 --> 00:38:08,862
Oh, I'm not hungry.

902
00:38:11,034 --> 00:38:12,034
What's wrong?

903
00:38:13,344 --> 00:38:14,344
Your boss.

904
00:38:15,448 --> 00:38:17,757
He's just so
standoffish and rude,

905
00:38:17,758 --> 00:38:20,102
and he's always on the phone.

906
00:38:20,103 --> 00:38:21,309
Yeah, listen.

907
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:24,516
He is just really
busy with his company.

908
00:38:24,517 --> 00:38:27,481
Yeah, you told me that, he's
always busy with the company.

909
00:38:27,482 --> 00:38:30,861
Okay, look, I'm sorry that
I keep making excuses for him.

910
00:38:30,862 --> 00:38:33,412
He's usually not
this standoffish and-

911
00:38:33,413 --> 00:38:34,550
- Rude!

912
00:38:34,551 --> 00:38:35,791
He's just very rude.
Yes, yes.

913
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:39,172
But, trust me, he is a good guy.

914
00:38:40,448 --> 00:38:41,931
Yeah, well, I wouldn't know.

915
00:38:44,034 --> 00:38:46,275
So, these the
flowers you chose?

916
00:38:47,827 --> 00:38:51,309
Well, I chose them,
he didn't choose them.

917
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:53,033
Guess I gotta start
over from scratch.

918
00:38:53,034 --> 00:38:55,550
It really
shouldn't be this hard.

919
00:38:55,551 --> 00:38:57,895
Okay, well, how
you gonna help me?

920
00:38:57,896 --> 00:39:01,171
All we have to do is
determine what you're like,

921
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,067
and then just choose
the appropriate bloom.

922
00:39:04,068 --> 00:39:06,240
Oh yeah, it sounds
that easy, huh?

923
00:39:06,241 --> 00:39:08,205
How do you know how I'm like?

924
00:39:08,206 --> 00:39:12,757
Okay, you are, let's see,
adventurous.

925
00:39:12,758 --> 00:39:16,067
So the amaryllis, huh?

926
00:39:16,068 --> 00:39:17,586
Yeah, I like those.

927
00:39:18,758 --> 00:39:20,378
See that? Don't
they look adventurous?

928
00:39:20,379 --> 00:39:21,586
- Yeah.
- I like those.

929
00:39:23,137 --> 00:39:27,240
And your heart is full of
innocent love and beauty,

930
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:30,274
so, the white orchid.

931
00:39:30,275 --> 00:39:31,516
- Those are nice.
- Oh, oh,

932
00:39:31,517 --> 00:39:32,797
and maybe the rose
bud, see that?

933
00:39:36,206 --> 00:39:38,550
And you are mischievous.

934
00:39:38,551 --> 00:39:39,586
So the petunia.

935
00:39:40,758 --> 00:39:41,758
Okay.

936
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:47,447
But underneath it
all, you're just sweet,

937
00:39:47,448 --> 00:39:50,551
so, the white carnation.

938
00:39:51,896 --> 00:39:52,896
I like that.

939
00:39:55,724 --> 00:39:57,033
Yeah.

940
00:39:57,034 --> 00:39:58,171
Food is here.

941
00:39:58,172 --> 00:40:02,412
Ooh, good, 'cause I am starving.

942
00:40:02,413 --> 00:40:03,619
Ready, Carter?

943
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:06,862
Come on, man, let's go.
Yeah, all right.

944
00:40:13,724 --> 00:40:16,068
So when do I get to
meet this mystery fiance?

945
00:40:17,172 --> 00:40:18,172
He's at work.

946
00:40:18,965 --> 00:40:20,885
How long you gonna keep
me waiting to meet him?

947
00:40:21,172 --> 00:40:22,792
You'll meet him soon enough.

948
00:40:22,793 --> 00:40:24,792
Are you guys gonna move in
together after you're married?

949
00:40:24,793 --> 00:40:27,447
Well, right now we
like our own space,

950
00:40:27,448 --> 00:40:30,274
but eventually we'll
move into one place.

951
00:40:30,275 --> 00:40:31,275
Crazy, right?

952
00:40:32,172 --> 00:40:33,896
Actually, no,
I've read about it.

953
00:40:34,172 --> 00:40:35,274
A lot of people
are doing it now.

954
00:40:35,275 --> 00:40:36,964
They're keeping their own space.

955
00:40:36,965 --> 00:40:40,171
Some even have separate
homes, it's very new age.

956
00:40:40,172 --> 00:40:41,447
Well, I'm meeting
him later for lunch,

957
00:40:41,448 --> 00:40:43,447
so we'll talk about it.

958
00:40:43,448 --> 00:40:45,171
All right, I'm about
to go run some errands.

959
00:40:45,172 --> 00:40:46,274
I'll see you later.

960
00:40:46,275 --> 00:40:47,344
- All right, bye.
- Bye.

961
00:40:48,793 --> 00:40:52,136
Just hanging with
Carter is always so effortless.

962
00:40:52,137 --> 00:40:55,274
It always feels so natural,
I'm always at ease with him.

963
00:40:55,275 --> 00:40:57,102
There are no games being played.

964
00:40:57,103 --> 00:41:00,724
With Carter, I feel safe,
I feel like I'm at home.

965
00:41:03,103 --> 00:41:04,103
Trisha!

966
00:41:07,517 --> 00:41:10,241
Why haven't you been answering
my texts or phone calls?

967
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,343
I can't do this now or ever.

968
00:41:14,344 --> 00:41:16,448
Or ever? What are
you talking about?

969
00:41:17,551 --> 00:41:18,551
We're done.

970
00:41:19,413 --> 00:41:21,274
Yeah, but we always say that.

971
00:41:21,275 --> 00:41:23,309
Well, this time I meant it.

972
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:25,067
And what makes this
time so different?

973
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:26,586
Trish, ready?

974
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:29,000
Yeah, ready.

975
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:31,688
So this is why.

976
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:33,654
No, Keith, it's
not what you think.

977
00:41:33,655 --> 00:41:34,896
Who's this?

978
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,827
Carter, this is Keith.

979
00:41:38,828 --> 00:41:39,965
Keith, this is Carter.

980
00:41:41,413 --> 00:41:42,551
Keith, what's up, man?

981
00:41:46,965 --> 00:41:47,965
We should go.

982
00:41:47,966 --> 00:41:49,758
Let's go, bye, Keith.

983
00:41:56,137 --> 00:41:57,171
Let me hear one more clink.

984
00:41:57,172 --> 00:41:58,172
That's a good clink.

985
00:42:00,517 --> 00:42:01,517
Spicy.

986
00:42:02,793 --> 00:42:04,655
So have you heard from Ben?

987
00:42:05,965 --> 00:42:07,171
Yeah, barely.

988
00:42:07,172 --> 00:42:10,240
He texted me, barely
could get his words out.

989
00:42:10,241 --> 00:42:12,723
Yeah, that's Ben.

990
00:42:12,724 --> 00:42:16,033
So, tell me about him.

991
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,447
Who?

992
00:42:17,448 --> 00:42:18,895
Who?

993
00:42:18,896 --> 00:42:20,378
The guy.

994
00:42:20,379 --> 00:42:22,379
Come on, your ex-boyfriend
from the cafe.

995
00:42:23,586 --> 00:42:25,309
- Keith?
- Yeah, is that his name?

996
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:27,481
Okay.
Oh, yeah.

997
00:42:27,482 --> 00:42:29,378
Hey, how did you
know he was my ex?

998
00:42:29,379 --> 00:42:31,895
Come on, I
know an ex when I see one.

999
00:42:31,896 --> 00:42:33,895
They got a certain ex look.

1000
00:42:33,896 --> 00:42:35,585
Yeah.

1001
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,999
Plus, he looked like
he wanted to kill me.

1002
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,171
He probably thought
we was together.

1003
00:42:40,172 --> 00:42:41,826
I know he saw the ring.

1004
00:42:41,827 --> 00:42:43,067
Oh, you think?

1005
00:42:43,068 --> 00:42:46,205
This is Carter with the,
Carter right here, yeah.

1006
00:42:46,206 --> 00:42:47,481
Yeah, I think you knew
what you was doing.

1007
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:48,826
I did.

1008
00:42:48,827 --> 00:42:51,136
So tell me about him.

1009
00:42:51,137 --> 00:42:52,654
Tell you about him for what?

1010
00:42:52,655 --> 00:42:56,343
We just been together
for years back and forth,

1011
00:42:56,344 --> 00:42:59,000
I thought he was
the one, you know?

1012
00:43:00,206 --> 00:43:03,619
I'm sorry, we can be
difficult sometimes.

1013
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,620
Yeah.

1014
00:43:05,793 --> 00:43:07,447
I just couldn't
get him to commit.

1015
00:43:07,448 --> 00:43:11,412
He always made me feel like I
was just asking for too much.

1016
00:43:11,413 --> 00:43:12,930
You know?

1017
00:43:12,931 --> 00:43:15,412
In my experience, you
should never be with someone

1018
00:43:15,413 --> 00:43:18,102
that makes you feel like
you're asking too much,

1019
00:43:18,103 --> 00:43:20,964
because the right person
wouldn't make you feel like that.

1020
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:22,205
Really?

1021
00:43:22,206 --> 00:43:23,826
So the back and forth,
you know, I get it,

1022
00:43:23,827 --> 00:43:26,379
could be scary to put
yourself out there sometimes,

1023
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,654
but believe me when I tell you.

1024
00:43:29,655 --> 00:43:31,688
- What?
- A woman like you,

1025
00:43:31,689 --> 00:43:34,585
a man should be sure about.

1026
00:43:34,586 --> 00:43:35,724
Oh, come on, really?

1027
00:43:36,896 --> 00:43:38,757
Girl, listen,
if we were dating,

1028
00:43:38,758 --> 00:43:40,447
there would be no hesitation.

1029
00:43:40,448 --> 00:43:42,378
Oh, come on.

1030
00:43:42,379 --> 00:43:44,412
You are amazing.

1031
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,033
Fine as hell.

1032
00:43:46,034 --> 00:43:49,102
Cool and funny.

1033
00:43:49,103 --> 00:43:51,550
What man wouldn't
wanna lock you down?

1034
00:43:51,551 --> 00:43:52,792
Apparently Keith.

1035
00:43:52,793 --> 00:43:54,033
Besides Keith.

1036
00:43:54,034 --> 00:43:55,792
Keith, he's got issues.

1037
00:43:55,793 --> 00:43:56,964
He does.

1038
00:43:56,965 --> 00:43:58,102
- I'm just saying.
- What?

1039
00:43:58,103 --> 00:43:59,930
Don't get hung up on one guy

1040
00:43:59,931 --> 00:44:02,758
who doesn't see what
another man would in you.

1041
00:44:05,689 --> 00:44:06,757
Okay.

1042
00:44:06,758 --> 00:44:07,999
Okay?

1043
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,205
You wanna help me
pick out some dresses?

1044
00:44:09,206 --> 00:44:10,378
Let's pick out some dresses.

1045
00:44:10,379 --> 00:44:11,481
Can we finish that drink first?

1046
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,102
Yeah.

1047
00:44:13,103 --> 00:44:14,620
I like your advice.

1048
00:44:15,448 --> 00:44:16,620
I'm serious.

1049
00:44:17,896 --> 00:44:19,136
- Serious as hell.
- This is good, this is good.

1050
00:44:19,137 --> 00:44:20,137
Good?

1051
00:44:23,448 --> 00:44:25,793
Come on already, I
need to see this dress.

1052
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,378
I'm turned around and
I got my eyes closed.

1053
00:44:29,379 --> 00:44:30,516
Oh, I hear it.
No peeking.

1054
00:44:30,517 --> 00:44:31,689
Okay, I have not.

1055
00:44:32,758 --> 00:44:35,205
- All right.
- Oh, yes!

1056
00:44:35,206 --> 00:44:36,826
- You like it?
- Yes.

1057
00:44:36,827 --> 00:44:39,205
Let me see it in
all it splendor.

1058
00:44:39,206 --> 00:44:40,861
Can I have a first dance?

1059
00:44:40,862 --> 00:44:42,861
Can we get some with it?

1060
00:44:42,862 --> 00:44:44,378
Oh, oh, all right!

1061
00:44:44,379 --> 00:44:45,481
Is that how we
doing with the snap?

1062
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:46,826
Are we snapping over here?

1063
00:44:46,827 --> 00:44:47,758
Girl, let me see it again.

1064
00:44:47,759 --> 00:44:49,757
Let me see with the spin.

1065
00:44:49,758 --> 00:44:50,689
That is nice.

1066
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:51,930
And then you going for the dip.

1067
00:44:51,931 --> 00:44:53,274
Let me dip, let dip.

1068
00:44:53,275 --> 00:44:55,723
Oh, I ain't gonna drop you.

1069
00:44:55,724 --> 00:44:56,930
- Please don't drop me.
- I won't drop you.

1070
00:44:56,931 --> 00:44:58,619
Let me get one
more spin though.

1071
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,136
All right.

1072
00:45:00,137 --> 00:45:02,102
And then you drop me,
but don't drop me, dip me.

1073
00:45:02,103 --> 00:45:03,861
All right, you ready?
You ready? You ready?

1074
00:45:03,862 --> 00:45:04,758
And then dip.

1075
00:45:04,759 --> 00:45:06,274
Don't drop.

1076
00:45:06,275 --> 00:45:09,655
I said don't drop, I knew
you were gon' drop me.

1077
00:45:12,241 --> 00:45:13,241
Yeah.

1078
00:45:35,586 --> 00:45:37,033
Carter.

1079
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:38,585
Carter, you gotta get up.

1080
00:45:38,586 --> 00:45:40,550
There's someone at the door.

1081
00:45:40,551 --> 00:45:42,724
Oh my God, I didn't
realize I fell asleep.

1082
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,172
See you later.

1083
00:45:48,827 --> 00:45:50,102
Hey girl.

1084
00:45:50,103 --> 00:45:51,585
Don't oh, hey girl me,
like I didn't just see

1085
00:45:51,586 --> 00:45:52,930
some man running
outta your house.

1086
00:45:52,931 --> 00:45:54,757
Oh girl, that was just Carter.

1087
00:45:54,758 --> 00:45:56,274
- Carter?
- Yes.

1088
00:45:56,275 --> 00:45:57,792
I thought you were marrying Ben.

1089
00:45:57,793 --> 00:46:00,205
I am, he's just
Ben's assistant.

1090
00:46:00,206 --> 00:46:01,826
He was just coming
over here to help me.

1091
00:46:01,827 --> 00:46:03,171
Hmm.

1092
00:46:03,172 --> 00:46:04,792
What? What's hmm?

1093
00:46:04,793 --> 00:46:07,654
Trust me, it's not
even like that.

1094
00:46:07,655 --> 00:46:09,171
You know what?

1095
00:46:09,172 --> 00:46:11,240
You're not gonna believe what
happened to me yesterday.

1096
00:46:11,241 --> 00:46:12,619
What happened yesterday?

1097
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:14,447
I ran into Keith.

1098
00:46:14,448 --> 00:46:15,619
Where?

1099
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:17,654
At the cafe with Carter.

1100
00:46:17,655 --> 00:46:19,136
And how was that?

1101
00:46:19,137 --> 00:46:21,861
And why are you and Ben's
assistant having lunch together

1102
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,516
and waking up the morning
after together too?

1103
00:46:24,517 --> 00:46:26,654
I told you, he's helping
me with the wedding.

1104
00:46:26,655 --> 00:46:27,861
And Keith wanted to know

1105
00:46:27,862 --> 00:46:29,724
why I hadn't returned
his phone calls.

1106
00:46:30,931 --> 00:46:31,931
What did you do?

1107
00:46:32,655 --> 00:46:35,655
I didn't know what to do,
so I just introduced them.

1108
00:46:37,724 --> 00:46:39,723
Keith wasn't feeling it.

1109
00:46:39,724 --> 00:46:41,895
He really looked hurt.

1110
00:46:41,896 --> 00:46:45,654
Well, you moved on, sort of,

1111
00:46:45,655 --> 00:46:48,067
and, plus, you said you
were done with him, so.

1112
00:46:48,068 --> 00:46:49,516
I know.

1113
00:46:49,517 --> 00:46:51,550
And Carter and I talked when
we got back to my place,

1114
00:46:51,551 --> 00:46:53,067
and you know what, girl?

1115
00:46:53,068 --> 00:46:54,757
He made me feel so much better.

1116
00:46:54,758 --> 00:46:56,136
Hmm.

1117
00:46:56,137 --> 00:46:57,792
He's really a sweetheart.

1118
00:46:57,793 --> 00:46:59,999
Let me find out, you're
getting over your ex

1119
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,412
by sleeping with your
fake husband's assistant.

1120
00:47:02,413 --> 00:47:05,861
Absolutely not, we just
hung out a few times.

1121
00:47:05,862 --> 00:47:08,516
I'm just saying you had
that look in your eyes.

1122
00:47:08,517 --> 00:47:10,206
What? No!

1123
00:47:11,413 --> 00:47:12,826
Well, hopefully
when it's all over,

1124
00:47:12,827 --> 00:47:14,447
you can leave Keith behind.

1125
00:47:14,448 --> 00:47:15,448
Exactly.

1126
00:47:16,344 --> 00:47:19,792
That's the plan.

1127
00:47:19,793 --> 00:47:21,412
Oh, more company.

1128
00:47:21,413 --> 00:47:23,206
Can you get that? I
gotta get dressed.

1129
00:47:31,413 --> 00:47:33,999
Oh, what's up, Steph?

1130
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,378
Hey, JJ.

1131
00:47:35,379 --> 00:47:36,241
How you doing?

1132
00:47:36,242 --> 00:47:37,654
You know, I'm alright.

1133
00:47:37,655 --> 00:47:40,412
I could be doing so much
better if you gave me a chance.

1134
00:47:40,413 --> 00:47:41,481
A chance at what?

1135
00:47:41,482 --> 00:47:42,654
You know.

1136
00:47:42,655 --> 00:47:43,792
Ew!

1137
00:47:43,793 --> 00:47:45,240
Leave her alone.

1138
00:47:45,241 --> 00:47:47,240
You know, you're practically
my little brother, right?

1139
00:47:47,241 --> 00:47:49,862
See, look, why you gotta
go and ruin it like that?

1140
00:47:50,724 --> 00:47:52,826
But Steph?
Yeah.

1141
00:47:52,827 --> 00:47:55,619
So you know about
this Ben guy, right?

1142
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:56,895
Yeah, why?

1143
00:47:56,896 --> 00:47:58,067
'Cause he's marrying my sister

1144
00:47:58,068 --> 00:47:59,343
and I don't know much about him.

1145
00:47:59,344 --> 00:48:00,792
What do you need
to know about him?

1146
00:48:00,793 --> 00:48:02,067
A lot!

1147
00:48:02,068 --> 00:48:03,309
'Cause what? Some guy
just comes outta nowhere

1148
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:04,826
and now you're marrying him?

1149
00:48:04,827 --> 00:48:06,757
That's kind the weird, sis,
you know what I'm saying?

1150
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:09,274
- Hey!
- I don't understand it.

1151
00:48:09,275 --> 00:48:11,413
Okay, I'll let you
two get caught up.

1152
00:48:13,482 --> 00:48:15,136
That was close.

1153
00:48:15,137 --> 00:48:17,033
I know, I wonder
why he's asking

1154
00:48:17,034 --> 00:48:18,619
all these questions
all of a sudden.

1155
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,619
I mean, I kind of get it.

1156
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,619
This all happened out
nowhere, and it's fake.

1157
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,309
My bad.

1158
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:26,241
Keep your cool, keep it down.

1159
00:48:27,275 --> 00:48:29,033
You know how nosy he is.

1160
00:48:29,034 --> 00:48:30,724
He's just gonna
keep asking questions.

1161
00:48:33,448 --> 00:48:34,448
Carter?

1162
00:48:40,965 --> 00:48:42,378
Hey, I didn't know
if you had food,

1163
00:48:42,379 --> 00:48:44,792
so I brought you some, some.

1164
00:48:44,793 --> 00:48:47,240
Aw, how sweet!

1165
00:48:47,241 --> 00:48:49,136
Nice to meet you, I'm
Stephanie, the best friend.

1166
00:48:49,137 --> 00:48:50,723
Nice to meet you.

1167
00:48:50,724 --> 00:48:52,067
Look, I'm just
gonna get going.

1168
00:48:52,068 --> 00:48:53,068
Bye, Carter.

1169
00:48:53,069 --> 00:48:55,447
Whoa, which one is this one?

1170
00:48:55,448 --> 00:48:57,723
- That's Carter.
- Who the hell is Carter?

1171
00:48:57,724 --> 00:48:58,620
This one?

1172
00:48:58,621 --> 00:48:59,896
Look, I'm her brother, JJ.

1173
00:49:02,827 --> 00:49:04,033
Look, sis, I don't
know what type

1174
00:49:04,034 --> 00:49:05,619
of freaky thing you
got going on over here,

1175
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,447
but I'm telling mom and dad.

1176
00:49:07,448 --> 00:49:10,000
And thank you for the sandwich.

1177
00:49:24,448 --> 00:49:25,965
What's going on?

1178
00:49:28,034 --> 00:49:30,862
I think I'm just
in over my head.

1179
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:36,550
I don't know what's going on.

1180
00:49:36,551 --> 00:49:38,550
I mean, I always wanted
the perfect wedding,

1181
00:49:38,551 --> 00:49:40,688
and Ben is making
that possible for me,

1182
00:49:40,689 --> 00:49:43,344
but I always loved Keith,

1183
00:49:44,379 --> 00:49:45,550
and I wanted to marry him,

1184
00:49:45,551 --> 00:49:47,930
but obviously he
doesn't feel the same.

1185
00:49:47,931 --> 00:49:49,688
Can I ask you a question?

1186
00:49:49,689 --> 00:49:51,033
Yeah, what?

1187
00:49:51,034 --> 00:49:53,447
How do you know
that you loved him?

1188
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:54,827
- Who? Keith?
- Mm-hm.

1189
00:49:56,275 --> 00:49:58,309
I don't know, we just
been together for so long,

1190
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:01,931
I'm just used to having
him around.

1191
00:50:03,448 --> 00:50:06,033
I mean, can I ask
you a question?

1192
00:50:06,034 --> 00:50:07,137
What about you?

1193
00:50:08,137 --> 00:50:10,516
Have you ever been in love?

1194
00:50:10,517 --> 00:50:12,171
Yeah.

1195
00:50:12,172 --> 00:50:13,172
Yeah.

1196
00:50:14,482 --> 00:50:18,688
I once read somewhere
that you are sleeping

1197
00:50:18,689 --> 00:50:21,343
'til you fall in love.

1198
00:50:21,344 --> 00:50:23,517
And at first, I didn't
know what that meant.

1199
00:50:25,517 --> 00:50:26,517
Then I met someone.

1200
00:50:29,551 --> 00:50:32,205
I couldn't sleep,
I couldn't eat,

1201
00:50:32,206 --> 00:50:34,172
I couldn't do anything,
but think of her.

1202
00:50:35,137 --> 00:50:37,000
At night, I dreamt of her.

1203
00:50:38,517 --> 00:50:40,931
When I woke up, all day I
couldn't wait to see her.

1204
00:50:46,517 --> 00:50:48,448
And when I did see her,

1205
00:50:50,862 --> 00:50:52,103
my heart turned over.

1206
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:57,310
And I was filled with desire.

1207
00:51:50,931 --> 00:51:51,931
Hey.

1208
00:51:54,103 --> 00:51:56,895
Good morning.

1209
00:51:56,896 --> 00:51:58,412
Good morning.

1210
00:51:58,413 --> 00:52:00,033
You okay?

1211
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:03,310
Carter, what happened
last night was a mistake.

1212
00:52:04,758 --> 00:52:07,067
My emotions were all mixed
up after seeing Keith,

1213
00:52:07,068 --> 00:52:09,412
and it should
never happen again.

1214
00:52:09,413 --> 00:52:10,861
Okay, wait.

1215
00:52:10,862 --> 00:52:13,620
Are you saying that
there's nothing between us?

1216
00:52:14,724 --> 00:52:16,688
No, I'm sorry.

1217
00:52:16,689 --> 00:52:19,206
Look, we should just focus
on planning the wedding.

1218
00:52:20,344 --> 00:52:21,930
Carter, you're a
really good friend,

1219
00:52:21,931 --> 00:52:24,000
but I can't handle
anything else.

1220
00:52:28,241 --> 00:52:29,241
I don't get it.

1221
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:33,240
You spend all this time searching
for someone to love you,

1222
00:52:33,241 --> 00:52:34,482
and now that you have it,

1223
00:52:35,689 --> 00:52:37,413
you're just gonna
let him walk away.

1224
00:53:03,275 --> 00:53:04,241
Hello?

1225
00:53:04,242 --> 00:53:05,481
I've been trying to call you.

1226
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:06,241
Why haven't you been
answering your phone?

1227
00:53:06,241 --> 00:53:07,241
I need to talk to you.

1228
00:53:07,827 --> 00:53:09,136
About what?

1229
00:53:09,137 --> 00:53:10,378
About us.

1230
00:53:10,379 --> 00:53:12,550
We've been over this,
I told you we're done.

1231
00:53:12,551 --> 00:53:13,723
I don't know going on
with you and that guy,

1232
00:53:13,724 --> 00:53:15,378
but I want you back.

1233
00:53:15,379 --> 00:53:16,344
What?

1234
00:53:16,345 --> 00:53:17,861
Yes, I want you back, babe.

1235
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:20,171
I want us to be together,
like really together.

1236
00:53:20,172 --> 00:53:21,654
Since when?

1237
00:53:21,655 --> 00:53:24,412
Since always, I just
didn't know how to do that.

1238
00:53:24,413 --> 00:53:26,412
And all of a sudden you do?

1239
00:53:26,413 --> 00:53:28,378
Why, because I'm with
someone else now?

1240
00:53:28,379 --> 00:53:29,895
Who cares why?

1241
00:53:29,896 --> 00:53:31,516
All I know is that I can't
stop thinking about you

1242
00:53:31,517 --> 00:53:33,067
and how bad I messed up.

1243
00:53:33,068 --> 00:53:35,171
And I know I messed up
over and over again.

1244
00:53:35,172 --> 00:53:37,619
And I know I don't deserve
another chance, baby,

1245
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:39,309
but I'm asking for it.

1246
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:40,757
Keith!

1247
00:53:40,758 --> 00:53:42,516
Just let me come over
tonight, that's all I'm asking.

1248
00:53:42,517 --> 00:53:46,343
And after that, if you want,
I won't bother you again,

1249
00:53:46,344 --> 00:53:49,551
but please just
let me come over.

1250
00:54:04,655 --> 00:54:07,102
So let me get this straight.

1251
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,793
You slept with
Carter last night?

1252
00:54:09,758 --> 00:54:10,758
Yes.

1253
00:54:11,482 --> 00:54:12,931
And you're marrying Ben?

1254
00:54:13,931 --> 00:54:15,447
Yes.

1255
00:54:15,448 --> 00:54:18,619
When Carter left, Keith
begged you to take him back?

1256
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:20,136
Yes.

1257
00:54:20,137 --> 00:54:22,412
And he wants to meet
up with you tonight?

1258
00:54:22,413 --> 00:54:23,965
Yes.

1259
00:54:25,379 --> 00:54:27,447
Girl, what are you gonna do?

1260
00:54:27,448 --> 00:54:31,136
I don't know, that's
why I called you.

1261
00:54:31,137 --> 00:54:32,137
I don't know why.

1262
00:54:33,068 --> 00:54:35,102
I've never been in a
situation where I was stuck

1263
00:54:35,103 --> 00:54:37,895
between the guy I
want, the guy I chose

1264
00:54:37,896 --> 00:54:39,379
and the guy who chose me.

1265
00:54:42,793 --> 00:54:44,102
Okay.

1266
00:54:44,103 --> 00:54:46,861
Let me ask you this,
do you like Carter?

1267
00:54:46,862 --> 00:54:49,034
Like, actually like him?

1268
00:54:50,379 --> 00:54:52,447
I like the idea of him.

1269
00:54:52,448 --> 00:54:57,379
He's romantic and caring and,
you know, he really sees me.

1270
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:00,757
But you've already
agreed to marry Ben

1271
00:55:00,758 --> 00:55:02,516
and signed the contract.

1272
00:55:02,517 --> 00:55:03,413
Right.

1273
00:55:03,413 --> 00:55:04,413
That part.

1274
00:55:06,275 --> 00:55:07,723
- Well.
- Well what.

1275
00:55:07,724 --> 00:55:09,550
At least it won't
be a real marriage,

1276
00:55:09,551 --> 00:55:11,516
and it'll only last a year.

1277
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:12,792
Yeah.

1278
00:55:12,793 --> 00:55:14,447
I like the idea of a wedding,

1279
00:55:14,448 --> 00:55:16,758
but I just wish I can
get rid of all these men.

1280
00:55:17,931 --> 00:55:19,343
What about Keith?

1281
00:55:19,344 --> 00:55:21,033
You said you were done with him.

1282
00:55:21,034 --> 00:55:24,654
I was, I mean, I
am, I don't know.

1283
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:27,481
He just sounded so sincere,

1284
00:55:27,482 --> 00:55:29,688
plus, we've been
together for so long.

1285
00:55:29,689 --> 00:55:31,205
Right, but haven't you been

1286
00:55:31,206 --> 00:55:33,309
down this road
with Keith before?

1287
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:34,550
I mean, he's the whole
reason you're doing

1288
00:55:34,551 --> 00:55:36,655
all this fake wedding
stuff to begin with.

1289
00:55:37,517 --> 00:55:38,517
Yeah.

1290
00:55:39,551 --> 00:55:41,862
Well, Keith and I have a
lot of history together.

1291
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:46,000
I guess I'm not ready to let
him go, like I thought I was.

1292
00:55:47,689 --> 00:55:49,102
Okay.

1293
00:55:49,103 --> 00:55:50,619
What?

1294
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:52,740
Who would you rather be
with when the wifi goes out?

1295
00:55:54,034 --> 00:55:55,447
What?

1296
00:55:55,448 --> 00:55:57,136
Just what I said.

1297
00:55:57,137 --> 00:56:00,000
Which one would you rather be
with when the wifi goes out?

1298
00:56:01,724 --> 00:56:02,758
I don't know.

1299
00:56:04,241 --> 00:56:05,723
Well, it looks like you
have a decision to make.

1300
00:56:05,724 --> 00:56:08,034
History or a new beginning.

1301
00:56:19,482 --> 00:56:20,310
Hey, babe.

1302
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:21,310
Hey.

1303
00:56:26,034 --> 00:56:28,241
Ah, thank you so
much for meeting me.

1304
00:56:29,448 --> 00:56:30,448
Don't thank me yet.

1305
00:56:32,103 --> 00:56:34,516
The flowers you got
me are beautiful.

1306
00:56:34,517 --> 00:56:35,999
Yeah, they're your favorite.

1307
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,240
Yeah.

1308
00:56:37,241 --> 00:56:39,205
Look, I'ma just
get right to it.

1309
00:56:39,206 --> 00:56:40,585
I know you engaged and all.

1310
00:56:40,586 --> 00:56:42,240
What?

1311
00:56:42,241 --> 00:56:44,241
Oh, right, right.

1312
00:56:45,103 --> 00:56:48,689
Yeah, I mean, and I don't
mean to be disrespectful,

1313
00:56:49,689 --> 00:56:51,757
and I'm probably too late, but-

1314
00:56:51,758 --> 00:56:53,412
- Well-
- Trisha.

1315
00:56:53,413 --> 00:56:54,344
What?

1316
00:56:54,345 --> 00:56:55,379
I love you.

1317
00:56:56,344 --> 00:56:57,344
You what?

1318
00:56:59,206 --> 00:57:01,309
I love you, and I always have,

1319
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:05,586
I just didn't know how to say
it or even admit it to myself.

1320
00:57:08,275 --> 00:57:09,516
You know what?

1321
00:57:09,517 --> 00:57:11,274
That's all I ever wanted
was to know how you felt

1322
00:57:11,275 --> 00:57:13,413
and what I meant to you.

1323
00:57:15,827 --> 00:57:18,655
And I'm sorry that I
couldn't give that to you.

1324
00:57:20,172 --> 00:57:22,965
Where has this
Keith been, huh?

1325
00:57:25,172 --> 00:57:27,378
I ordered your favorite.

1326
00:57:27,379 --> 00:57:28,448
I like him.

1327
00:57:37,827 --> 00:57:42,827
Who could this be?

1328
00:57:43,413 --> 00:57:44,413
Oh my God.

1329
00:57:45,586 --> 00:57:47,516
Trisha, just
coming to see you.

1330
00:57:47,517 --> 00:57:50,241
Calling the phone, you wasn't
answering, and I got worried.

1331
00:57:51,827 --> 00:57:53,413
I guess there's no need to be.

1332
00:57:55,172 --> 00:57:57,619
Keith and I,
we were just talking.

1333
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:58,586
Talking?

1334
00:57:58,587 --> 00:57:59,793
Looks more like a date to me.

1335
00:58:00,965 --> 00:58:02,067
No.

1336
00:58:02,068 --> 00:58:03,137
I'll call you later.

1337
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:09,067
He's gonna call you later?

1338
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:10,792
What's going on with that?

1339
00:58:10,793 --> 00:58:12,067
What are you doing here?

1340
00:58:12,068 --> 00:58:13,412
I told you I was
coming to see you.

1341
00:58:13,413 --> 00:58:16,240
Since when have you
wanted to see me, huh?

1342
00:58:16,241 --> 00:58:17,861
You haven't been
interested in anything.

1343
00:58:17,862 --> 00:58:20,516
Okay, I haven't been involved
in a lot, but who cares?

1344
00:58:20,517 --> 00:58:21,826
I'm paying for everything.

1345
00:58:21,827 --> 00:58:23,826
- That's not the point.
- No, that is the point.

1346
00:58:23,827 --> 00:58:25,585
I'm footing the bill to give
you the wedding of your dreams,

1347
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:27,861
and you out here
dating other dudes?

1348
00:58:27,862 --> 00:58:29,999
I'm not dating other
dudes, that's just my ex,

1349
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:30,827
and we have a lot of history.

1350
00:58:30,828 --> 00:58:32,793
I don't care, Trisha.

1351
00:58:33,965 --> 00:58:35,654
I don't want you
seeing him again.

1352
00:58:35,655 --> 00:58:36,861
You can't tell me what to do.

1353
00:58:36,862 --> 00:58:38,171
You know what?

1354
00:58:38,172 --> 00:58:42,136
I don't have time
for this, goodnight.

1355
00:58:42,137 --> 00:58:43,137
What?

1356
00:58:44,034 --> 00:58:45,034
Give me those!

1357
00:58:55,068 --> 00:58:56,378
Keith and I have history

1358
00:58:56,379 --> 00:58:58,309
and a connection
that I can't deny.

1359
00:58:58,310 --> 00:59:00,412
Even though I can't
stand him sometimes,

1360
00:59:00,413 --> 00:59:03,481
I really feel like he
wants to change for me.

1361
00:59:03,482 --> 00:59:07,102
Ben could actually give me my
dream wedding with no problem,

1362
00:59:07,103 --> 00:59:10,585
but I don't have any
real feelings for him.

1363
00:59:10,586 --> 00:59:12,067
It wouldn't be fair
for either of us,

1364
00:59:12,068 --> 00:59:13,550
but then there's Carter.

1365
00:59:13,551 --> 00:59:16,309
Carter could actually
be the perfect guy,

1366
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:18,654
but I don't know if
he's the one for me.

1367
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:21,000
I don't know if I have
real feelings for him.

1368
00:59:25,724 --> 00:59:26,861
Trisha, girl, where are you?

1369
00:59:26,862 --> 00:59:28,620
Answer the phone.

1370
00:59:38,413 --> 00:59:39,758
That's it, I'm calling JJ.

1371
00:59:45,758 --> 00:59:47,275
What, JJ?

1372
01:00:31,896 --> 01:00:33,103
Ay yo, Trish!

1373
01:00:34,275 --> 01:00:35,275
Yo?

1374
01:00:36,413 --> 01:00:37,413
Trish!

1375
01:00:39,034 --> 01:00:40,965
You know, I take out
your trash, right?

1376
01:00:45,827 --> 01:00:47,447
Stephanie called
ma looking for you.

1377
01:00:47,448 --> 01:00:49,619
Said she ain't heard
from you since yesterday.

1378
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:51,551
So ma sent me over.

1379
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,895
Yeah, I don't feel like
talking to anyone, JJ.

1380
01:00:54,896 --> 01:00:56,654
And what happened, sis?

1381
01:00:56,655 --> 01:00:58,654
- Nothing happened.
- Oh no, something happened,

1382
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,895
'cause I see chocolate wrappers,
and you don't eat chocolate

1383
01:01:00,896 --> 01:01:03,447
unless you're either
nervous or stressed.

1384
01:01:03,448 --> 01:01:07,654
And since you have all of
these flowers everywhere,

1385
01:01:07,655 --> 01:01:09,000
I'm guessing you're stressed.

1386
01:01:10,344 --> 01:01:12,000
Everything is
just so messed up.

1387
01:01:13,206 --> 01:01:16,689
All right, what
happened, Trish?

1388
01:01:23,034 --> 01:01:25,585
Yeah, now I don't know
what to do about it.

1389
01:01:25,586 --> 01:01:27,205
Wow!

1390
01:01:27,206 --> 01:01:28,310
That's a lot.

1391
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:33,826
Look, please don't
tell mom and dad,

1392
01:01:33,827 --> 01:01:35,102
I don't feel like talking
to 'em about this.

1393
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:37,172
No, I ain't gonna
say nothing this time.

1394
01:01:38,206 --> 01:01:39,620
That's crazy, Trish!

1395
01:01:40,517 --> 01:01:41,964
Why you sound so old and wise?

1396
01:01:41,965 --> 01:01:43,688
Why you sound so old and wise?

1397
01:01:43,689 --> 01:01:44,862
'Cause I always been.

1398
01:01:47,517 --> 01:01:48,517
But...

1399
01:01:51,137 --> 01:01:53,343
You see what I'm
looking at, right?

1400
01:01:53,344 --> 01:01:55,343
Oh my gosh, you want
some chocolate, here.

1401
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:56,550
Yeah, I want some
of that chocolate.

1402
01:01:56,551 --> 01:01:58,378
And it better be
the good kind, ooh.

1403
01:01:58,379 --> 01:02:00,516
Okay, I see what
you working with.

1404
01:02:00,517 --> 01:02:03,000
Now, what you
watching over there?

1405
01:02:08,655 --> 01:02:09,964
Thank you for coming over.

1406
01:02:09,965 --> 01:02:11,826
I wanted to talk to you
about something, Keith.

1407
01:02:11,827 --> 01:02:13,550
Yeah, I'm glad you called.

1408
01:02:13,551 --> 01:02:15,102
I need to talk to you too.

1409
01:02:15,103 --> 01:02:16,757
I was thinking about how-

1410
01:02:16,758 --> 01:02:18,930
- Wait, let me go first.

1411
01:02:18,931 --> 01:02:19,896
Why?

1412
01:02:19,897 --> 01:02:21,378
What's this?

1413
01:02:21,379 --> 01:02:23,067
The house.

1414
01:02:23,068 --> 01:02:25,516
I can see that, but why
are you showing me this?

1415
01:02:25,517 --> 01:02:26,861
I closed on it today.

1416
01:02:26,862 --> 01:02:28,102
I wanted to tell you
about it at dinner,

1417
01:02:28,103 --> 01:02:29,930
but I didn't get a chance.

1418
01:02:29,931 --> 01:02:30,931
It's beautiful.

1419
01:02:32,379 --> 01:02:33,379
Yeah.

1420
01:02:34,103 --> 01:02:35,551
I'm serious this time.

1421
01:02:36,758 --> 01:02:39,241
You know I'm engaged, right?

1422
01:02:41,413 --> 01:02:43,344
Yeah, I know, but listen-

1423
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:45,758
- Wait a minute, wait.

1424
01:02:46,655 --> 01:02:47,655
Baby.

1425
01:02:51,275 --> 01:02:52,792
You really just
can't stay away, can you?

1426
01:02:52,793 --> 01:02:54,723
- Bro, who are you anyway?
- I'm her fiance.

1427
01:02:54,724 --> 01:02:55,930
I thought the other
guy was your fiance.

1428
01:02:55,931 --> 01:02:57,240
What other guy?

1429
01:02:57,241 --> 01:02:58,206
The one you went
on the date with.

1430
01:02:58,207 --> 01:02:59,447
Who you went on a with?

1431
01:02:59,448 --> 01:03:00,792
No, it was Carter
and it wasn't a date.

1432
01:03:00,793 --> 01:03:02,655
It sure looked
like a date to me.

1433
01:03:03,482 --> 01:03:05,240
Look, I did call
Keith over here,

1434
01:03:05,241 --> 01:03:06,274
but Ben, it's not
what you think.

1435
01:03:06,275 --> 01:03:07,103
Oh, it's not?

1436
01:03:07,103 --> 01:03:08,000
Then why am I here for?

1437
01:03:08,001 --> 01:03:09,067
Yeah, what is he here for?

1438
01:03:09,068 --> 01:03:10,412
Bro, why are you here?

1439
01:03:10,413 --> 01:03:12,516
I came to talk to my woman.

1440
01:03:12,517 --> 01:03:16,826
Look, guys, this is all
a messy situation, I know,

1441
01:03:16,827 --> 01:03:21,102
but Keith, you been on
and off with me for years,

1442
01:03:21,103 --> 01:03:23,102
and now you wanna be serious?

1443
01:03:23,103 --> 01:03:25,792
And then Ben, we
doing a fake marriage!

1444
01:03:25,793 --> 01:03:27,240
Oh, fake what?

1445
01:03:27,241 --> 01:03:30,688
A fake marriage, this
wedding ring isn't even real.

1446
01:03:30,689 --> 01:03:32,792
Look, and this is all
your fault, Keith.

1447
01:03:32,793 --> 01:03:34,619
My fault? How
is this my fault?

1448
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:37,448
Because you've been playing
with my head for years now.

1449
01:03:39,034 --> 01:03:41,757
So I desperately signed a
contract for someone to marry me.

1450
01:03:41,758 --> 01:03:44,275
Just wanted to know what
it felt like to be wanted.

1451
01:03:46,172 --> 01:03:47,585
Stephanie was right.

1452
01:03:47,586 --> 01:03:50,171
This is crazy, all
of this is crazy.

1453
01:03:50,172 --> 01:03:51,654
Both of you get out!

1454
01:03:51,655 --> 01:03:52,792
Why do I have to get out?

1455
01:03:52,793 --> 01:03:54,274
I was here first.

1456
01:03:54,275 --> 01:03:55,172
Yeah, and I'm marrying
you, so why I gotta leave?

1457
01:03:55,173 --> 01:03:56,516
Because I need to think,

1458
01:03:56,517 --> 01:03:58,379
and I can't do it with
the both of you here.

1459
01:04:00,172 --> 01:04:01,310
I'll call you.

1460
01:04:02,931 --> 01:04:04,447
Okay, so which one of
us are you talking to?

1461
01:04:04,448 --> 01:04:06,240
I don't know!

1462
01:04:06,241 --> 01:04:07,241
Just go!

1463
01:04:12,896 --> 01:04:15,517
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Come on, man!

1464
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:08,000
Mom, am I crazy?

1465
01:05:08,931 --> 01:05:10,654
No, no, of course not.

1466
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:14,206
You're just very passionate,
and you want what you want.

1467
01:05:15,793 --> 01:05:17,620
You're just like
your father that way.

1468
01:05:18,965 --> 01:05:20,793
How did this all
get so messed up?

1469
01:05:22,137 --> 01:05:24,931
Because it's life,
sweetie, it's messy.

1470
01:05:26,724 --> 01:05:27,620
Why is it so messy?

1471
01:05:27,621 --> 01:05:29,275
Why can't it just be simple?

1472
01:05:30,482 --> 01:05:32,757
Now, what would
be the fun in that?

1473
01:05:32,758 --> 01:05:34,205
Yeah.

1474
01:05:34,206 --> 01:05:36,205
I'm surprised JJ
didn't tell you guys

1475
01:05:36,206 --> 01:05:37,620
all about what's going on.

1476
01:05:39,068 --> 01:05:41,309
Trust me, your father
tried to get it out of him,

1477
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:43,172
but he wouldn't budge.

1478
01:05:45,758 --> 01:05:46,758
What do I do?

1479
01:05:47,896 --> 01:05:51,240
Well, the only thing
you can do now is

1480
01:05:51,241 --> 01:05:52,620
follow what's in your heart.

1481
01:05:54,206 --> 01:05:55,793
Yeah, but what if it's wrong?

1482
01:05:57,689 --> 01:05:59,930
There's no way
of knowing that.

1483
01:05:59,931 --> 01:06:01,275
Just gotta trust yourself.

1484
01:06:03,517 --> 01:06:05,481
It's gonna be okay.

1485
01:06:05,482 --> 01:06:07,861
We're gonna get through it.

1486
01:06:07,862 --> 01:06:08,827
Come here.

1487
01:06:08,828 --> 01:06:10,343
It's gonna be all right, baby.

1488
01:06:10,344 --> 01:06:11,619
I hope so.

1489
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:13,275
It will, trust me.

1490
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:15,861
Listen to your mama.

1491
01:06:15,862 --> 01:06:17,172
Mama knows best.

1492
01:06:22,586 --> 01:06:24,481
Hey, darling.

1493
01:06:24,482 --> 01:06:26,102
Hey daddy.

1494
01:06:26,103 --> 01:06:31,758
Well, I talked with
your mother and brother.

1495
01:06:32,931 --> 01:06:35,033
Let me guess, you
think I'm crazy too?

1496
01:06:35,034 --> 01:06:36,516
No, nobody thinks
you're crazy.

1497
01:06:36,517 --> 01:06:39,861
We wanna make sure
you're okay, no judgment.

1498
01:06:39,862 --> 01:06:41,274
I'm okay.

1499
01:06:41,275 --> 01:06:42,964
I just gotta figure
out what to do.

1500
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:46,309
You probably won't
know until you do it.

1501
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:48,585
I just want someone to love.

1502
01:06:48,586 --> 01:06:50,205
I know you do.

1503
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:52,861
Nothing's wrong with that, okay?

1504
01:06:52,862 --> 01:06:53,862
Okay.

1505
01:06:56,034 --> 01:06:57,413
These apples are so good.

1506
01:06:58,448 --> 01:06:59,861
- You know what?
- What?

1507
01:06:59,862 --> 01:07:01,999
I'm surprised JJ
ain't come around.

1508
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:02,931
You know, food out.

1509
01:07:02,932 --> 01:07:04,723
You know that boy can eat.

1510
01:07:04,724 --> 01:07:05,827
He can eat.

1511
01:07:10,482 --> 01:07:11,517
Thanks, dad.

1512
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,999
Are you ready to do this?

1513
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,240
I am.

1514
01:07:21,241 --> 01:07:23,068
Okay, I'll be
out here waiting.

1515
01:07:32,103 --> 01:07:33,412
Hey, baby.

1516
01:07:33,413 --> 01:07:34,895
Hey.

1517
01:07:34,896 --> 01:07:36,378
You want a drink?

1518
01:07:36,379 --> 01:07:37,447
No, I'm okay.

1519
01:07:37,448 --> 01:07:39,931
No drink, that's not good.

1520
01:07:42,758 --> 01:07:44,241
Keith.

1521
01:07:46,517 --> 01:07:47,551
I have to let you go.

1522
01:07:49,758 --> 01:07:52,205
Yeah, I knew it wasn't good.

1523
01:07:52,206 --> 01:07:54,689
And Keith, I need
you to let me go.

1524
01:07:55,758 --> 01:07:57,310
So you chose him over me?

1525
01:07:58,551 --> 01:08:01,482
No, I'm not
choosing him over you.

1526
01:08:02,655 --> 01:08:03,931
I'm choosing myself.

1527
01:08:05,448 --> 01:08:06,930
Look, we've been doing
this long enough.

1528
01:08:06,931 --> 01:08:08,551
I can't keep doing this.

1529
01:08:13,379 --> 01:08:14,379
I know.

1530
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,482
I'm sorry for all of this.

1531
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:20,379
And I know you deserve more.

1532
01:08:22,448 --> 01:08:23,931
Take care of yourself.

1533
01:08:38,931 --> 01:08:41,102
It looked like it went well.

1534
01:08:41,103 --> 01:08:42,964
Yeah, it did go well.

1535
01:08:42,965 --> 01:08:44,654
I feel good about it.

1536
01:08:44,655 --> 01:08:45,826
I'm just glad
you're finally able

1537
01:08:45,827 --> 01:08:47,482
to close this
chapter of your life.

1538
01:08:48,551 --> 01:08:49,654
What?

1539
01:08:49,655 --> 01:08:51,274
You ready for this next step?

1540
01:08:51,275 --> 01:08:52,964
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Okay.

1541
01:08:52,965 --> 01:08:54,310
Let's go.

1542
01:09:00,137 --> 01:09:03,102
Not quite the same
as when I was seven,

1543
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:07,067
but my day is finally here
and I've been waiting so long

1544
01:09:07,068 --> 01:09:09,550

can wait another second.

to be your lawfully wedded wife?

1566
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
I do.

1567
01:10:27,482 --> 01:10:31,550
Do you, Trisha, take Benjamin

1568
01:10:31,551 --> 01:10:34,206
to be your lawfully
wedded husband?

1569
01:10:44,172 --> 01:10:45,172
Ben.

1570
01:10:46,068 --> 01:10:47,068
You were saying.

1571
01:10:54,172 --> 01:10:56,723
I was only getting married
because I didn't wanna be alone

1572
01:10:56,724 --> 01:11:00,792
and I wanted a wedding.
My God.

1573
01:11:00,793 --> 01:11:02,274
And Ben's only getting married

1574
01:11:02,275 --> 01:11:06,516
because he wanted to inherit
his family's business,

1575
01:11:06,517 --> 01:11:07,862
but I can't do this.

1576
01:11:12,379 --> 01:11:15,965
All my life I wanted
the perfect wedding,

1577
01:11:17,827 --> 01:11:20,241
but now that I'm here,
this is not what I want.

1578
01:11:21,793 --> 01:11:23,068
This is not what I want.

1579
01:11:24,482 --> 01:11:28,517
I just want someone to love
and who's gonna love me.

1580
01:11:29,448 --> 01:11:32,067
I want someone to help me
pick out the perfect flowers

1581
01:11:32,068 --> 01:11:34,724
because he already knows
that I'm the perfect flower.

1582
01:11:36,965 --> 01:11:44,033
I want someone who
never second guesses

1583
01:11:44,034 --> 01:11:46,481
if he loves me, because
