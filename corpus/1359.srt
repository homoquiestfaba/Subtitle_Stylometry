1
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,157
<i>It's cold this morning, Captain.</i>

2
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,434
<i>Cold.</i>

3
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,750
<i>And hard.</i>

4
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,837
<i>It's time, Captain.</i>

5
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,117
<i>It's time.</i>

6
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,795
<i>Time indeed.</i>

7
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,149
You're supposed
to be upstairs sleeping.

8
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,156
- Stanley keeps waking me up.
- Oh, I get it...

9
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,277
- You're getting heavy.
- No nonsense.

10
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,115
Two stories. Two glasses of water.
Jack...

11
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:00,594
- You're going to miss the plane.
- Go upstairs with Mrs Wheeler.

12
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,992
When I'm on my business trip,
I'll get Stanley a little brother.

13
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,277
- Promise?
- I promise.

14
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,319
- Can I get you anything, sir?
- No, thank you.

15
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,156
If you try and get some sleep,
the flight will go a lot faster.

16
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,710
I can never sleep on a plane.
Turbulence.

17
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,952
- Pardon?
- Turbulence.

18
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,398
Solar radiation heats the earth's crust,
warm air rises, cool air descends.

19
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,394
- I don't like that.
- Try to get some sleep anyway.

20
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,196
Dr Ryan?

21
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,148
Jack, get yourself in here.

22
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,834
Jesus, you look like hell.

23
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,788
Thank you very much, Admiral.
I could use some coffee.

24
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,509
I'm not going to ask you
how your flight went.

25
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:18,710
- When did you last get some sleep?
- I don't know.

26
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,838
Milk and sugar.

27
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,757
How's Caroline? Last time I saw her
was at your granddad's place in Maine.

28
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,196
She's fine.
She sends you her best.

29
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,673
And Sally?
What is she now, three?

30
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,719
No, she's a very precocious five.

31
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,715
She announced the other day
that her life would be less lonely -

32
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,919
- if we were to buy her
a baby brother.

33
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,710
But she decided it would be enough
if we were to buy one for Stanley.

34
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,316
- Who's Stanley?
- Stanley's a bear.

35
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,228
What's important enough to get you
on a plane in the middle of the night?

36
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,871
<i>British Intelligence obtained
these pictures of the Red October.</i>

37
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,749
- She's the latest Typhoon class.
- Big son of a bitch.

38
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,674
12 metres longer than standard.
3 metres wider.

39
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,594
- Captain's name is Ramius.
- One of yours?

40
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:29,073
I did the bio on him last year.
He always takes out their lead boat.

41
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,109
Good political connections.
Trains their attack-boat skippers.

42
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,159
<i>The Russians call him
Vilnius Nastavnic.</i>

43
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,756
The Vilnius schoolmaster.

44
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,550
- What are these doors?
- Those doors are the problem.

45
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:53,717
I don't know what they are, neither
do the British. Perhaps they're new.

46
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,236
I'd like to show these to Skip Tyler.

47
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,234
- The sub driver?
- He was until he lost his leg.

48
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:06,190
Now he teaches at the Academy.
He's got top-secret clearance.

49
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,593
Have the car for Dr Ryan
downstairs in ten minutes.

50
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,073
<i>The satellite caught Red October
in Polijarny Inlet this morning.</i>

51
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,628
- Do you hear it?
- No.

52
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,079
At Cal Tech we used to do this
in our sleep. Do you hear it now?

53
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,358
Wait a minute... maybe.

54
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,717
- It's buried in surface clutter.
- Yes.

55
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,077
- I should go to SAPS?
- Correct, Seaman Beaumont.

56
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,755
Signal Algorithmic
Processing Systems.

57
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,356
Give it a week
and you'll be teaching at Cal Tech.

58
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,389
So, like Beethoven on the computer, -

59
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,791
- you have laboured to produce...

60
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,839
...a biologic.

61
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,878
- A what?
- A whale.

62
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,834
A marine mammal that knows
a lot more about sonar than you do.

63
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,949
Kill SAPS.
Go over to 269, and let's try it again.

64
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,717
If he gets to bothering you,
ask him about Pavarotti.

65
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:11,512
I was in the middle of teaching
Beaumont about modern sonar.

66
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,312
- I'm chief of the boat.
- Tell me, Cobb.

67
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,517
Okay, go ahead.

68
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,153
Seaman Jones
is into music in a big way.

69
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,872
He figures this whole boat
is his personal, private stereo set.

70
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,636
- He gets this Pavarotti...
- It was Paganini.

71
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,870
This is my story.

72
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,396
Pavarotti is a tenor.
Paganini was a composer.

73
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:50,114
He's got this music,
and he's listening to it on his head set.

74
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,876
Then all hell breaks loose.
There's a slew of boats at San Diego.

75
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,034
- And one way out at Pearl.
- All of a sudden...

76
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,035
Pavarotti is coming out of their asses.
Jones...

77
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,075
- What do I do?
- I got it.

78
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:17,112
New contact bearing 097.
Designate contact Sierra-35.

79
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,159
<i>- What have you got, Jonesy?
- Probably submerged.</i>

80
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:27,031
<i>It could be a missile boat
out of Polijarny.</i>

81
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,319
Start your track.
I'll be there in a minute.

82
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,388
<i>Time to open the orders, sir.
The Political Officer is in your cabin.</i>

83
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,079
<i>Very well.</i>

84
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,631
<i>Carry on.</i>

85
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:09,077
<i>- What are you doing?
- Overseeing the stability of the crew.</i>

86
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,109
<i>By invading my privacy?</i>

87
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:19,195
<i>Privacy is not a major concern
in the Soviet Union.</i>

88
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,955
<i>It is often contrary
to the collective good.</i>

89
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:35,512
<i>"Behold, I am coming as a thief".</i>

90
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,391
<i>"And they gathered them together
in a place called Armageddon".</i>

91
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:48,196
"The 7th angel poured forth his bowl,
and a voice cried out from Heaven..."

92
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,830
"It is done".

93
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,994
A man with your responsibilities
reading about the end of the world.

94
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:03,235
What's this? "I am become death,
the destroyer of worlds".

95
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,393
It is an ancient Hindu text
quoted by an American.

96
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,677
- An American?
- He invented the atomic bomb.

97
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,276
He was accused of being a communist.

98
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,910
You wrote and underlined
these passages.

99
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,594
No.

100
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,114
This book belonged to my wife.
I keep it for sentimental value.

101
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,352
I'm sorry.
Your wife was a beautiful woman.

102
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,159
Her death was unfortunate.

103
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,269
I am only doing my job.
It is my responsibility.

104
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,471
How many KGB agents
are aboard my boat?

105
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:48,192
Your boat? This vessel belongs
to the people of the Soviet Union.

106
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,592
Besides, if the KGB or the GRU
has agents aboard, -

107
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,911
- I would be the last to know.

108
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,511
I suggest we open our orders.

109
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,592
Certainly, comrade.

110
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,393
From Commander Strategic Forces
Red Banner Northern Fleet.

111
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:54,475
We are to proceed north,
to grid square 5490.

112
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:00,954
We're to rendezvous with Konovalov,
Capt. Tupolev's boat.

113
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,070
- You know Tupolev?
- I know he was your student.

114
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,835
It's rumoured
he has a place in his heart for you.

115
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,313
There's little room in Tupolev's heart
for anyone but Tupolev.

116
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:24,195
We are to make contact and run tests.
Tupolev will hunt our ship.

117
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,148
We are to evaluate the readiness
of the caterpillar drive.

118
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:33,030
We return to Polijarny
on or about the 16th of this month.

119
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,115
This is an historic moment.
I should like to make a request.

120
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,316
Before you proceed...

121
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,996
Would you permit me
to post the orders for the crew?

122
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,194
Where I am going, you cannot follow.

123
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,918
Dr Petrov, report to my cabin.
There's been a dreadful accident.

124
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,993
There's no cradle underneath it.
Get it over.

125
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,314
You want to come up here
and do it yourself?

126
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,230
Ryan! Who let you in here?

127
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,678
Have they got you
playing with models now?

128
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:54,312
Damn it, Phil!
Tell them to slow down.

129
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,678
It's not a model.
It's a DSRV. A rescue sub.

130
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,638
What are you doing with it?

131
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:08,636
We're rigging it with a generic
docking collar for other subs.

132
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,951
We can get it anywhere in the world
in 24 hours.

133
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:19,271
- How's your back?
- It's fine. Have you got a minute?

134
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,158
It's bigger than a regular Typhoon.
What are these doors?

135
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,959
You don't miss much.

136
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,033
Those are too big
to be torpedo tubes.

137
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,159
- Can you launch an ICBM horizontally?
- Why would you want to?

138
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,633
They're symmetrical,
right down the long axis of the sub.

139
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,920
- How about a towed sonar array?
- Too close to the screws.

140
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,072
I'll be...

141
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,038
This could be a caterpillar.

142
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,115
- A what?
- Magneto-hydrodynamic propulsion.

143
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,475
- Do you follow?
- No.

144
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,918
It's like a jet engine for the water.

145
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,835
It's got no moving parts,
so it's very, very quiet.

146
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,915
- How quiet?
- Sonar wouldn't pick it up.

147
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:21,076
Maybe as a seismic anomaly.
It wouldn't sound like a submarine.

148
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:27,873
We messed with this a few years ago.
Couldn't make it work.

149
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:33,353
- They really built this?
- She put to sea this morning.

150
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,351
When I was twelve I helped my daddy
build a bomb shelter in our basement, -

151
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:49,356
- because some fool parked a dozen
warheads off the coast of Florida.

152
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,638
This thing could park 200 warheads
off Washington or New York -

153
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:59,716
- and no one would know anything
about it until it was all over.

154
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,197
- Are you all right, Captain?
- Yes.

155
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,717
It's just, to die from something
as petty as slipping on tea...

156
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,112
It was an accident.
You'll feel better when we put in.

157
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,590
- Put in?
- Return to base.

158
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,880
- We have no political officer.
- This is a Soviet combat vessel.

159
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:37,230
We do not cancel operations
because of accidents.

160
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,758
Seaman, come here.
Come here.

161
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,998
- Your name?
- Cook's Assistant Loginov.

162
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,835
I want you and the doctor
to witness this.

163
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,269
I'm removing the Political Officer's
missile key and keeping it myself.

164
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,955
We should report this
to Red Fleet Command.

165
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:07,513
That's impossible.
Our orders are for radio silence.

166
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,674
- That's all, Loginov.
- This is most unnerving.

167
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:20,235
The reason for having two missile keys
is so that no one man may...

168
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,349
- May what?
- May arm the missiles.

169
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,752
- Perhaps I should keep the key.
- That'll be all, Doctor.

170
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:35,358
When I address the crew,
then you will understand.

171
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:45,272
Petrov, I will try to forget your
comments when I present my report.

172
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,477
Thank you, sir.

173
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:58,793
Holding steady on 310.
12 knots at about 20,000 yards.

174
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,795
- Have you got a make on it?
- The computer is chewing on it.

175
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,111
It sounds like a Typhoon.

176
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:22,397
- Did I miss something on the boards?
- Sub plant hasn't said anything.

177
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,318
- How many Typhoons are listed?
- Six.

178
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:35,350
Call this guy Typhoon 7.
Work in a little closer.

179
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:43,115
- Won't he hear us?
- Not if we stay in his baffles.

180
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,068
Come in behind his propeller
and he's deaf as a post.

181
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:20,549
- Any sonar contacts?
- No, the sonar is clear.

182
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,872
- Do we have any surface contacts?
- No, the scope is clear.

183
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:29,318
Good. Then it's time I explain
our orders to the crew.

184
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,597
<i>Comrades, this is your captain.</i>

185
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,752
<i>It is an honour to speak to you -</i>

186
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:41,755
<i>- While sailing in our motherland's
most recent achievement.</i>

187
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:46,630
Once more,
we play our dangerous game.

188
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:52,352
A game of chess, against our old
adversary, the American Navy.

189
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:59,437
<i>For 40 years, your fathers before you,
you played this game well.</i>

190
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,754
<i>But today the game is different.
We have the advantage.</i>

191
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,913
It reminds me of the heady days
of Sputnik and Yuri Gagarin.

192
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,356
The world trembled
at the sound of our rockets.

193
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,876
It will tremble again
at the sound of our silence.

194
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,953
The order is: Engage the silent drive.

195
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,795
Ballast control, open outer doors.

196
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,111
Engage caterpillar
and secure main engines.

197
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,551
Doors opening.

198
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,554
Our own fleet doesn't know
our full potential.

199
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,393
<i>They will test us.</i>

200
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:45,475
<i>But they will embarrass themselves.
We'll leave our fleet behind.</i>

201
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,952
We will pass through
the American patrols.

202
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:55,035
We'll lay off their largest city
and listen to their rock and roll, -

203
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,158
- while we conduct missile drills.

204
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,110
When we are finished, the only
sound they will hear is our laughter.

205
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:11,469
<i>Then we will sail to Havana
for sunshine and comradeship.</i>

206
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,989
- Cryogenic plant coming on line.
- A great day. We sail into history.

207
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,790
Caterpillar engaging.

208
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,195
Caterpillar engaging.

209
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,634
- What happened?
- I don't know.

210
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,829
Full rudder left.

211
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,879
Navigator, new course: 250.

212
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,112
Course: 250.

213
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,433
Sonar contact. Port quarter.

214
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,639
- American, Los Angeles class.
- American!

215
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,951
Course: 310.

216
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:14,231
- Is the American turning to follow us?
- No, he is continuing on his course.

217
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,473
- He is continuing north-west.
- He can't hear us.

218
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,837
And the singing?

219
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,991
Let them sing.

220
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,828
What are you talking about?
Check again.

221
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,390
The sonar is working.
The Russian disappeared.

222
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:11,792
One minute he was steady,
then he was gone.

223
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,715
- And I thought I heard...
- Heard what?

224
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,032
I thought I heard singing, sir.

225
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,749
- Singing?
- Yes, sir.

226
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,717
<i>Good morning, sir.</i>

227
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,592
<i>Good morning, sir.</i>

228
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,073
<i>Good morning, sir.</i>

229
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,838
Good morning, sir.
I hope you had a lovely evening.

230
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,231
A little chilly this morning.

231
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,631
There's a letter from Marko Ramius.

232
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,075
Marko!

233
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,031
Yes?

234
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,715
No, this is Dr Ryan.

235
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,671
- What happened?
- This is no longer research.

236
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,793
I got a line on those doors.
You know what they are?

237
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,669
- A silent propulsion system.
- How did you know that?

238
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,709
The sub captain radioed in. The thing
disappeared right in front of him.

239
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,519
That's only the half of it.

240
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,310
- You got your ID?
- This is unbelievable.

241
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,871
<i>The Kirov, the Kiev, the Minsk.</i>

242
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,952
- Their whole fleet.
- That's right.

243
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,111
- Where are we going?
- Briefing for Jeffrey Pelt.

244
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:09,515
The President's Security Advisor.
Most of the Joint Chiefs will be there.

245
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,753
- Who is giving the briefing?
- You are.

246
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,948
All the slides are laid out for you.
All you've got to do...

247
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,189
Look, no one understands
this material better than you.

248
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,988
Give him a run down of the sub
and the stuff in your hand.

249
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:37,392
When he asks direct questions,
give him direct answers.

250
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:41,314
Tell him what you think. Come on.

251
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:53,398
The last 24 hours have seen some
extraordinary Soviet naval activity.

252
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:57,269
<i>The first ship to sail
was the Red October, -</i>

253
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,876
- in reference
to the October revolution of 1917.

254
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,510
A variant of the Typhoon class,
she's 650 feet long -

255
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:09,708
- and 32,000 tons
submerged displacement.

256
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:17,790
We believe that these doors
enclose a unique propulsion system.

257
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,316
A magneto-hydrodynamic drive,
or caterpillar, -

258
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,189
- that would enable the sub
to run virtually silent.

259
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:30,753
It is possible that this new drive system
allowed Capt. Ramius...

260
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,798
Do we have his picture available?

261
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:39,432
<i>...to elude our attack boat Dallas,
which was trailing Red October.</i>

262
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,832
It is also possible
that this drive system -

263
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,835
<i>- could render the Red October
undetectable to our warning nets.</i>

264
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,994
Would you characterise this
as a first-strike weapon?

265
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,159
That is a possibility.

266
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:07,714
It is designed to approach by stealth
and armed with nuclear warheads.

267
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,960
- Damn thing was made to start a war.
- Proceed, Mr Ryan.

268
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,749
<i>After the Dallas lost contact,
there were additional sailings.</i>

269
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,392
From Polijarny, Leningrad
and from the Mediterranean.

270
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:28,475
There are now some 58 nuclear subs
headed at high speed into the Atlantic.

271
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,475
This afternoon's satellite pass
over Polijarny found heat blooms -

272
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:38,634
<i>- indicating that the Kirov, the Minsk
and 20 other ships were ready to sail.</i>

273
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,590
This constitutes the bulk
of the Soviet surface fleet.

274
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,912
The data supports
no conclusions as yet.

275
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:55,634
Absence of activity in the Pacific
suggests that this is just an exercise.

276
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,679
Suppose this is a move against NATO?

277
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:06,632
I have some very sensitive information.
It must not leave this room.

278
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,078
Before sailing, Ramius sent a letter
to Admiral Yuri Padorin.

279
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,676
He's chairman of
the Red Fleet Northern Directorate.

280
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:19,072
That's her uncle, Ramius' wife.

281
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,277
Padorin is her uncle.

282
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:29,198
Padorin immediately demanded
a meeting with Premier Chenyenko.

283
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:35,230
<i>Within minutes of that meeting,
orders were given to find Red October-</i>

284
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,914
- and sink her.

285
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,118
- Sink her?
- They've got a madman on their hands.

286
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,195
Within 500 miles off the coast,
we'll have only two minutes' warning.

287
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,630
- Today's the 23rd, isn't it?
- Yeah.

288
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,396
You son of a bitch.

289
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,996
You son of a bitch!

290
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:30,749
Do you wish to add something
to our discussion, Dr Ryan?

291
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:40,711
Well, perhaps there's another
possibility we might consider.

292
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,350
Ramius might be trying to defect.

293
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,830
- Do you mean to suggest...?
- Proceed.

294
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,670
Ramius trained
most of their officer corps.

295
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:00,118
He could select men
willing to help him.

296
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,556
He's not Russian.
He's Lithuanian.

297
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,395
He was raised by his grandfather.

298
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,917
He has no children.
No ties to leave behind.

299
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,831
Today is the first anniversary
of his wife's death.

300
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,870
- Come on. You're just an analyst.
- I know Ramius.

301
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:28,511
He's a legend among his men.
He's always been a maverick.

302
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:33,151
I met him at an embassy dinner.
Have you met Capt. Ramius, General?

303
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:48,598
How long before Ramius could be
in a position to fire his missiles at us?

304
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,436
- Four days.
- All right, I'll brief the President.

305
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:59,116
Dr Ryan, would you stay
for a moment, please?

306
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,319
I said speak your mind, Jack,
but Jesus!

307
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,751
You slammed the door on the general.

308
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,310
- That was not my intention.
- Yes, it was.

309
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,873
He was patronising you.
In my opinion he deserved it.

310
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,909
I'm a politician,
which means I'm a cheat and a liar.

311
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,470
When I'm not kissing babies,
I'm stealing their lollipops.

312
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:40,430
But it also means
that I keep my options open.

313
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:45,958
Let's assume for a minute
that you're right, -

314
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:52,434
- and this Russian intends to defect.
What do you suggest we do about it?

315
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,189
- We definitely grab the boat.
- Wait a minute.

316
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,477
This is not a stray pilot with a MiG.

317
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,395
We're talking about several billion
dollars worth of Soviet property.

318
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,315
- They're going to want it back.
- We could inspect it.

319
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,393
Call it a Coastguard safety inspection.

320
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,791
How do we proceed?

321
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,589
We need to contact the commanders
in the Atlantic directly.

322
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:27,151
If the Russians get one whiff of this,
the game is up.

323
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,232
We need to be able to help them.

324
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,837
We need to be ready to go
at a moment's notice.

325
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,154
And somebody has to find out
what Ramius' intentions really are.

326
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,278
Okay, when do you leave?

327
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,157
Wait a minute!

328
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,233
The general was right.
I am only an analyst.

329
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,392
You're perfect.
I can't ask any of these characters.

330
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,996
They wouldn't stake their reputations
on a hunch.

331
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,391
- You...
- Are expendable.

332
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,237
Something like that.

333
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,710
I'll give you three days.

334
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:19,194
After that, I have to hunt down Ramius
and destroy him. Will you do it?

335
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,356
Mother of God!

336
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:43,755
Secure the masts. All ahead two thirds.
Set depth to 900 metres.

337
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,755
Come left, heading 205.

338
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:10,793
These orders
are seven bloody hours old!

339
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,430
- Captain...?
- All ahead flank.

340
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:19,549
Inquire of the engineer about
going to 105% on the reactor.

341
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:25,397
Seven hours!
The entire fleet is after him.

342
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,434
900 metres.

343
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:41,948
105% on the reactor is possible...
but not recommended.

344
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,112
Go to 105 on the reactor.

345
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:03,196
- What is it? Where are we going?
- We're going to kill a friend.

346
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,476
We're going to kill Ramius.

347
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,111
If you like borscht perhaps,
but I've eaten better in the galley.

348
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,354
My wife asked the waiter
if the chef was from Afghanistan.

349
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:40,752
Then we went on to the ballet,
to see the new girl as Giselle.

350
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:45,232
Remember how beautiful she was?
She just married a factory manager...

351
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:51,714
Doctor, do you have the figures
for the last batch of radiation tests?

352
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,155
Now?

353
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,357
Now.

354
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:03,072
Bring the preceding set as well,
for comparison.

355
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,993
Thank you, Doctor.

356
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,151
It will take him some time.

357
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,996
Before we begin, I'd like to know
what happened to Putin.

358
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:42,670
- He didn't slip on his tea, did he?
- I don't think I like your tone.

359
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:49,757
- We're risking our lives here.
- Putin could have made complications.

360
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,799
Did you think
he would go away and sulk?

361
00:44:53,960 --> 00:45:00,274
- Are you saying he was murdered?
- Stop whining, Yuri.

362
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:04,149
So he was murdered.
The man was a pig.

363
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:08,313
But it is a decision
we should have all made together.

364
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:13,315
If the crew finds out,
we could have a mutiny.

365
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:19,237
Everything that happens on this ship
affects us all.

366
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:24,793
- Why don't we go back?
- There'll be no going back.

367
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,557
Before we sailed I dispatched a letter
to Admiral Padorin, -

368
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,918
- in which I announced
our intention to defect.

369
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,876
In the name of God, why?

370
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:44,511
When he reached the new world,
Cortez burned his ships.

371
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:49,959
- Thus, his men were well motivated.
- You have signed our death warrants.

372
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:55,558
- Padorin will send the entire fleet.
- Jesus! They'll find us.

373
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:00,191
Nobody is going to find us.
That's enough, Yuri.

374
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:05,639
You couldn't just
turn the sub over to the Americans.

375
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,395
You had to make a political statement.

376
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:15,999
Or was it something deeper that
made you unable to simply slip away?

377
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:22,395
- Was it ego, Captain?
- We each have our reasons, Victor.

378
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,997
My own began the day I was handed
the blueprints for this ship.

379
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:31,597
A ship which had but one use.
As for the rest, -

380
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,117
- those are things that I alone
must carry the burden for.

381
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,638
Anatoly, you're afraid of our fleet.
You should be.

382
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,749
Personally, I give us...
one chance in three.

383
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,794
More tea, anyone?

384
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,719
No?

385
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,077
Then you may
report back to your posts.

386
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:21,076
You heard the captain, dismissed.

387
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,591
Captain.

388
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:47,598
I would never disagree with you
in front of the men.

389
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,309
But in this case Victor was right.

390
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:56,235
It would have been better
if you had not informed Moscow.

391
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,758
Moscow is not the worry,
nor the whole Soviet Navy.

392
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,313
I know their tactics.
I have the advantage.

393
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,629
The worry is the Americans.

394
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:18,874
If we meet the right sort,
this will work.

395
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,317
If we get some buckaroo...

396
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:33,716
Some turbulence.
You don't like flying?

397
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,919
This is nothing. You should
have been here five months ago.

398
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:42,596
Talk about puke! We ran into
a hail storm over the Sea of Japan.

399
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:47,117
The pilot shot his lunch
all over the windshield.

400
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,840
I barfed on the radio.

401
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,711
It wasn't that lightweight stuff.
It was that chunky industrial puke.

402
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,156
You want a bite?

403
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:02,517
Next time I get a bright idea,
I'll put it in a memo.

404
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:15,951
- Sir.
- That will be all, Lieutenant.

405
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:20,875
- Did that Hawkeye trap?
- Number four wire.

406
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:25,079
- Not bad considering.
- The gentleman is here to see you.

407
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,198
What the hell are you talking about?

408
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:33,036
I apologise for the uniform. It's
Admiral Greer's idea of a low profile.

409
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:39,389
If you're working for Jim Greer,
you can tell me what this is all about.

410
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,870
Captain, have you got a minute?
Here's something you ought to see.

411
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:53,148
Get yourself a cup of coffee.
I'll have some tea.

412
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,471
Get the captain a cup of tea.

413
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:05,430
The moment that sub went silent
and I thought I heard singing...

414
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:12,073
I heard something in the background,
too, and I managed to get it on tape.

415
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,995
I washed it through the computer
and managed to isolate this sound.

416
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,835
The computer identified it
as magma displacement.

417
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,835
The SAPS software was originally
written to look for seismic events.

418
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,675
When it gets confused,
it runs home to momma.

419
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,718
- I'm not following you.
- I'm sorry.

420
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,758
Listen to it at ten times speed.

421
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,999
That's got to be man-made.

422
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,432
The first contact was at 09:15
and the bearing was 269.

423
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:02,720
At 09:30, it was here.
At 11 and 11:15, it was here and here.

424
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:08,352
Russian subs have been reported
running Reykjanes Ridge at high speed.

425
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:11,830
- They had hyper-accurate maps.
- Yeah, Red Route One.

426
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,630
The front door to those canyons
was a location called Thor's Twins.

427
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,030
Look...

428
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,954
Right into Red Route One.

429
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:43,231
You may think I'm crazy, but I'll bet
we found some new Russian sub.

430
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:47,313
It's now headed for the Iceland coast.

431
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:53,749
A $40 million computer tells you
you're chasing an earthquake, -

432
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:59,040
- but you don't believe it. And you
come up with this on your own.

433
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:04,957
- Yes, sir.
- Relax, you've sold me.

434
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:12,515
Plot us a course for the bottom end
of Red Route One.

435
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:17,959
We'll never find him in those canyons.
But first we'd better phone in.

436
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,112
Aye, aye, Captain.

437
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,630
Hang on, Jonesy.

438
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:38,753
If I can get you close enough,
can you track this sucker?

439
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:44,870
Now that I know what to listen for...
I'll bag him.

440
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,636
- Carry on.
- Yes, sir.

441
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:56,148
That's the craziest notion ever!
An entire nuclear submarine?

442
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:00,472
They can't all want to defect,
even if it's only the officers.

443
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,030
- What's his plan?
- His plan?

444
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,510
Russians don't take a dump
without a plan.

445
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:12,151
Senior captains are sure
to have thought the matter through.

446
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:16,472
- He's just going to sail into New York?
- It might be that simple.

447
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,393
Things might be simple at CIA.

448
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:24,554
But in the middle of the North Atlantic
they get a bit more complex.

449
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,190
- Smoke?
- No, thank you.

450
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:32,512
And you'd need more
than a few days' inspection.

451
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:36,912
In order to be any value,
you'd have to tear it apart.

452
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:42,154
- Then we have to keep it.
- What will you do with the crew?

453
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:45,915
They'd know we got the boat.

454
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:51,871
- Or do you plan to eliminate them?
- We're not at war, sir.

455
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:57,512
So we have to do this in such a way
that they think we don't have the boat.

456
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:01,355
They'll go back
and report that we don't have it.

457
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:06,469
Otherwise this whole business
is just academic, right?

458
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,790
Yes, I see your point.

459
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:16,031
- When was the last time you slept?
- A while.

460
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,359
- The chief outside will fix you up.
- Thank you, sir.

461
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,829
Captain.

462
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,036
It'll be dawn soon. We'll be in the CIC.

463
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:36,149
Things are liable to get
a little dicey around here.

464
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,077
- You think he's crazy?
- Certifiable.

465
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:52,279
And I don't care for him
wearing the uniform.

466
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:57,992
Did you see that ring on his finger?
The Academy class of '72. A Marine.

467
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:04,759
In the summer of his third year,
he went down in a chopper accident.

468
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:11,473
He spent ten months in traction
and another year learning to walk.

469
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:16,475
He did his fourth year
from the hospital.

470
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:21,873
It's up to you, Charlie, but you might
consider cutting him a little slack.

471
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:28,271
The Russians will find that sub
before we get near it anyway.

472
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:52,518
- Passing Thor's Twins, sir.
- Very good.

473
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,838
<i>- Passing the Twins now, sir.
- Commence your run.</i>

474
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,072
<i>Call me hen you get to the first turn.</i>

475
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:08,119
Mr Kamarov, commence your run.

476
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:14,355
First leg on my mark.
Course: 260. Speed: 18 knots.

477
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:17,159
Depth: 270 metres.

478
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:22,314
Five, four, three, two, one...

479
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,675
Mark.

480
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:30,392
Diving Command, course: 260.
Speed: 18 knots.

481
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:37,033
Give me a stopwatch and a map and I'll
fly the Alps in a plane with no windows.

482
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,476
If the map is accurate enough.

483
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:03,753
We're in the lane
and approaching the first turn.

484
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,630
Come left to course 195
in 30 seconds.

485
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:13,510
Decrease depth to 200 metres.
Maintain speed.

486
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:19,553
Captain, we are approaching
the first turn.

487
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:24,316
Increase speed to 26 knots
and recompute.

488
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,198
Aye, Captain.

489
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:33,114
Navigator, recompute for 26 knots.

490
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:38,354
Turn on my mark. Five, four, three...

491
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,273
...two, one, mark.

492
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:46,036
Diving control,
come left to 195. Up on the bow planes.

493
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:58,919
Course now 195
and maintaining speed 26 knots.

494
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,953
- Mr Kamarov?
- Next leg, Captain.

495
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:12,558
Come right to 240
at 8 minutes and 40 seconds.

496
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,349
Very good.
Maintain course and speed.

497
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:22,596
Too fast, Vassily.

498
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:27,959
Those charts are laid out precisely.
So many knots for so many seconds.

499
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:33,035
- This thing handles like a pig.
- Watch your bearing, Mr Slavin.

500
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:42,514
15 seconds to turn.
Should we decrease speed?

501
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:46,593
Negative. Prepare to come right.

502
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:51,276
Eight, seven, six, five, four...

503
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,035
...three, two, one, mark.

504
00:58:55,200 --> 00:59:00,593
15 degrees on the bow planes.
Come right. 240. Move it!

505
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:24,155
We're in the lane. Next leg
34 minutes to the Neptune Massif.

506
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:27,198
Course: 240.

507
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,429
- What happened?
- The cryogenic plant.

508
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:47,515
The magnets aren't being cooled.
We're 50 degrees above red line.

509
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:52,310
- It's going to melt.
- Kill it, shut it down!

510
00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:02,075
<i>- The cryogenic plant failed.
- Reactor damage?</i>

511
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:06,631
- The reactor scrammed automatically.
- Was there any core damage?

512
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:10,031
- Any radiation leakage?
- I don't know yet.

513
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:16,196
- How long will it take to fix?
- I've got to find out what's wrong first.

514
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:21,474
We will have to stop
and repair the caterpillar unit.

515
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:27,715
<i>- We will run on normal propulsion.
- Captain, we will not be silent.</i>

516
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:33,432
Make revolutions for 20 knots
and engage the propellers.

517
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:41,870
- Aye, Captain.
- That man will get us all killed.

518
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:49,317
The captain knows what he's doing.

519
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:56,918
Naval activities?
I have no knowledge of this.

520
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:01,039
- But then I never was a sailor.
- Mr Ambassador...

521
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:05,876
You have nearly 100 naval vessels
operating in the North Atlantic.

522
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:09,077
You've dropped enough sonar buoys -

523
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:14,360
- for a man to walk from Greenland
to Scotland without getting his feet wet.

524
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:19,435
You make your point
as delicately as ever.

525
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:24,276
What looks like an exercise
could be a prelude to war.

526
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:29,275
How can we tell the difference?
We have to deploy our ships.

527
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,318
Has your government considered -

528
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:38,032
- that having your ships and ours
in such proximity -

529
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:44,036
- is inherently dangerous?
Wars have begun that way.

530
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:57,631
- We have lost one of our submarines.
- Lost it?

531
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,758
This is most embarrassing.

532
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:07,189
Several of the crew, the officers,
are sons of high Party officials.

533
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:12,878
One is even the son
of a Central Committee member.

534
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:18,955
- This is a massive rescue operation?
- That is correct.

535
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,356
I'm terribly sorry. How can we help?

536
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:31,991
- I'm not sure that...
- Perhaps a joint rescue mission?

537
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,112
That is very gracious of you.

538
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:41,113
I will pass your offer on.

539
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,352
But I think we're doing
everything that can be done.

540
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,555
Captain.

541
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:13,312
Our strategy depends on your answer.
The fleet will know where we are.

542
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:18,190
Sonar. We have just been overflown
by a low-altitude, multi-engined plane.

543
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,954
Put it on audio.

544
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:28,434
It's closing.
Water entry of small objects.

545
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:32,513
- Sonar buoys.
- Battle stations.

546
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:35,638
Battle stations!

547
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:39,270
How long to Neptune Massif?

548
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:43,877
- How long?
- 4 minutes, 10 seconds.

549
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:47,919
- Should we bottom the boat?
- It's too late for that now.

550
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:53,598
We're out of time. Counter measures.
Prepare to launch a full spread.

551
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,752
Request permission to launch.

552
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,718
Launch the weapon.

553
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,995
<i>Weapon is away.</i>

554
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:19,877
High-speed screw.
Torpedo in the water.

555
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,956
Torpedo is active.

556
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:28,874
- Torpedo has acquired.
- Launch counter measures.

557
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:31,600
Aye, sir.

558
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:41,475
- How long to the turn?
- 2 minutes, 9 seconds.

559
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:44,837
We've no room to manoeuvre.

560
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,355
Shut up!

561
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:56,831
Torpedo has reached
counter measures and lost contact.

562
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:05,077
Torpedo has reacquired and is homing.

563
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:10,473
- Give me the count.
- Turn at Massif in 30 seconds.

564
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,235
- Time to torpedo impact?
- 35 seconds.

565
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,995
- Increase to flank.
- Full-ahead flank.

566
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:24,679
Torpedo impact now 40 seconds.
35 seconds.

567
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,513
30 seconds.

568
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:38,673
Turn at Massif in seven, six...

569
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:41,957
...five, four...

570
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:46,033
...three, two, one, mark.

571
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:50,079
- Torpedo impact: 25 seconds.
- The turn, Captain.

572
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:57,358
Mark plus eight seconds, nine, ten...

573
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:04,198
...11 seconds, 12, 13, 14...
plus 15 seconds.

574
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:09,639
- Captain, we're out of position.
- Torpedo impact in 15 seconds.

575
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,917
Sound collision.

576
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:17,392
- We're out of the lane.
- You're relieved.

577
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:28,159
Right full rudder!
Reverse starboard engine!

578
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:34,997
Torpedo impact: 12 seconds.

579
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:41,315
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5...

580
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:48,836
Navigator,
16 degrees off the bow plane.

581
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:16,119
- They're really shooting at us! Why?
- Easy, boy.

582
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:22,958
If they were really shooting at us,
we'd be dead by now.
