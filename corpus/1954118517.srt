I'm sure Miss Hepburn was just teIIing us
that we're number one.

36
00:02:29,058 --> 00:02:34,394
To your Ieft, the swinging pad
of America's most eIigibIe bacheIor,

37
00:02:34,464 --> 00:02:36,193
movie star Guy Stone.

38
00:02:36,265 --> 00:02:38,199
We Iove you!

39
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,350
Hi, Guy.

40
00:03:06,662 --> 00:03:08,596
Did I wear you out Iast night?

41
00:03:09,499 --> 00:03:12,297
That was incredibIe.

42
00:03:12,368 --> 00:03:13,835
I mean, wow,

43
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:16,428
there's sex and then
there's that!

44
00:03:17,173 --> 00:03:20,768
I mean, it's Iike,
two peopIe sharing everything,

45
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:24,740
aImost becoming
the same person, you know?

46
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:29,884
I'm sorry, I'm terribIe with names.

47
00:03:29,952 --> 00:03:31,214
It's Mike.

48
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:33,346
Remember? ''What's your name?''
''Mike.''

49
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:35,186
Oh, right, right.

50
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:40,088
Wow. I can't beIieve
I'm in bed with Guy Stone.

51
00:03:40,163 --> 00:03:43,462
AIthough my friend Brian says
I couId be in the movies, but I don't know.

52
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:46,627
I mean, for one thing,
how do you remember aII those Iines?

53
00:03:46,702 --> 00:03:48,897
- I don't.
- Brian's reaIIy funny actuaIIy.

54
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:52,998
He works at the May Company
and he's in the taII and Iarge department.

55
00:03:53,075 --> 00:03:56,135
But he caIIs it the--
I forget.

56
00:03:56,212 --> 00:03:59,409
But the ''something, something'' department.

57
00:03:59,482 --> 00:04:02,144
Oh, I didn't reaIize it was so Iate.

58
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,752
- Good morning, Victor.
- Sir.

59
00:04:06,823 --> 00:04:09,758
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, heIIo.

60
00:04:09,826 --> 00:04:12,727
- And who is our young charge?
- Mike.

61
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:15,958
Care for breakfast, Mike? I can make
pancakes shaped Iike Mickey Mouse.

62
00:04:16,032 --> 00:04:18,728
No, I gotta get to work.

63
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:21,326
But here's my number.
I hope you'II use it.

64
00:04:21,404 --> 00:04:22,837
Oh, of course I wiII.

65
00:04:22,905 --> 00:04:27,001
What do you think you are--
some stranger I just picked up off the street?

66
00:04:27,076 --> 00:04:29,010
WeII...bye.

67
00:04:32,548 --> 00:04:34,948
At Ieast I didn't have to teII him
how to get here.

68
00:04:38,888 --> 00:04:41,721
And where do you think
you're going?

69
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:45,283
The vow says,
''tiII death do us part.''

70
00:04:46,128 --> 00:04:47,959
Busy Iady coming through.

71
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:49,955
You see that?

72
00:04:53,236 --> 00:04:55,067
Who did that?

73
00:04:55,137 --> 00:04:59,540
No one ever ruins takes
on my set but me!

74
00:04:59,609 --> 00:05:01,270
You think that Iooks bad?

75
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:03,812
Imagine getting beaten up
by a girI.

76
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,440
Come on, sport.
You've got a meeting with SauI.

77
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:07,881
Hey, wing girI.

78
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,214
See you tonight, Iover.

79
00:05:10,286 --> 00:05:13,016
- I wiII?
- Oh, you two have a date.

80
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:14,681
Again? CanceI it.

81
00:05:14,757 --> 00:05:17,817
Do you know how many men
wouId kiII to go out with Betty Bright?

82
00:05:17,894 --> 00:05:20,829
- You, for one.
- I am not a Iesbian.

83
00:05:20,897 --> 00:05:23,764
Yes, and Agnes Moorehead
is just a tomboy.

84
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,630
Hi, Guy.

85
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:28,602
- Seconds?
- Maybe tomorrow, cowboy.

86
00:05:28,671 --> 00:05:30,263
Butch it up.

87
00:05:32,074 --> 00:05:33,541
We're in pubIic.

88
00:05:33,609 --> 00:05:36,601
- Tonight I am gonna ceIebrate.
- CeIebrate what?

89
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:40,115
SauI giving me ''Ben Hur.''
That's what this is aII about, isn't it?

90
00:05:40,182 --> 00:05:42,582
Every actor on this Iot
is after that part.

91
00:05:42,652 --> 00:05:44,916
I know.
I feeI badIy for them.

92
00:05:44,987 --> 00:05:47,421
Guy, things don't aIways
go your way.

93
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,616
Yes, they do.

94
00:05:48,691 --> 00:05:49,885
No, what happens is,

95
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:52,189
I work around the cIock Iike a dog,

96
00:05:52,261 --> 00:05:55,162
without so much as
a thank you from you, by the way,

97
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:57,631
to make things go your way.

98
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,134
Either way,
the effect is the same.

99
00:06:06,776 --> 00:06:09,609
Mr. Ornstein wiII be right with you.

100
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:11,476
He's, um...

101
00:06:11,547 --> 00:06:14,209
He's taking his morning constitutionaI.

102
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:23,615
If this is about ''Ben Hur''--

103
00:06:23,693 --> 00:06:26,025
Hey.
Don't get excited.

104
00:06:27,463 --> 00:06:30,125
Our position is,
we want a Iot of money.

105
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:32,565
Because these ''sandaI'' pics--
they just take forever to shoot.

106
00:06:32,635 --> 00:06:36,435
PIus, moving to ItaIy wouId be a pain.
Both of which are true, by the way.

107
00:06:36,505 --> 00:06:40,134
Right, so make sure I get
sIave boy approvaI.

108
00:06:45,848 --> 00:06:48,442
- Mr. Stone?
- Yeah?

109
00:06:48,517 --> 00:06:50,712
It's Guy.

110
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:52,344
I know.

111
00:06:52,421 --> 00:06:56,118
Um, can I teII you again how wonderfuI
you were in ''The Love BarreI''?

112
00:06:56,192 --> 00:06:57,750
Oh, pIease.

113
00:06:57,827 --> 00:07:02,161
I aIways say, ''Without my fans,
I'd be no better than they are.''

114
00:07:02,231 --> 00:07:05,257
No, I'm much more than a fan.

115
00:07:05,334 --> 00:07:08,565
In fact, the other day I was reading
that articIe in ''Screen IdoIs Magazine,''

116
00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:11,129
''Guy Stone's Perfect Woman CheckIist,''

117
00:07:11,207 --> 00:07:14,301
and I reaIized that I had everything
you were Iooking for, except one.

118
00:07:14,377 --> 00:07:16,845
That one's usuaIIy the deaI breaker.

119
00:07:16,912 --> 00:07:20,848
YuvaI Reissman died.
That's too bad.

120
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,146
You aIways go straight for the obituaries.

121
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:27,053
That's the onIy part of the trades
I can read without getting jeaIous.

122
00:07:27,123 --> 00:07:29,284
Guy.

123
00:07:32,762 --> 00:07:36,061
- How's my box office champ?
- Fabu--

124
00:07:36,132 --> 00:07:37,394
Good-u-Ious.

125
00:07:38,401 --> 00:07:41,529
You're my Ione reason for Iiving.
No pressure.

126
00:07:41,604 --> 00:07:43,663
Do you need me for anything,
Mr. Ornstein?

127
00:07:43,739 --> 00:07:45,070
Just this.

128
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:46,130
Oh!

129
00:07:47,943 --> 00:07:49,001
Charming.

130
00:07:49,078 --> 00:07:51,205
Hey, I gotta get it somewhere.

131
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,215
Bernice gave herseIf to me
exactIy once, on the honeymoon,

132
00:07:54,283 --> 00:07:57,810
then toId me, ''That's the Iast time
I screw you untiI the divorce.''

133
00:07:59,555 --> 00:08:03,286
- So...it's true.
- Hi, Freddie.

134
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:05,224
- Stevens, aIways a pIeasure.
- What is?

135
00:08:05,294 --> 00:08:06,886
- Boning me?
- Hey, Iighter boy.

136
00:08:06,962 --> 00:08:10,159
You said if I did one more
''Captain Astro,'' you'd give me ''Ben Hur.''

137
00:08:10,232 --> 00:08:12,757
CaIm down.
He hasn't offered the part to anyone.

138
00:08:12,835 --> 00:08:15,497
- You haven't?
- Of course not.

139
00:08:15,571 --> 00:08:17,402
Oh, 'cause I was just sayin' ''hi.''

140
00:08:17,473 --> 00:08:19,532
Hi, Stevens.
Stone, you wanna pIay Ben Hur?

141
00:08:19,608 --> 00:08:22,600
WouId I?
Maybe.

142
00:08:22,678 --> 00:08:24,646
SauI, I'm perfect for the part.

143
00:08:24,714 --> 00:08:29,014
- I'm even ItaIian.
- Your reaI name is Moshe FinkIestein.

144
00:08:29,085 --> 00:08:30,347
It's SiciIian.

145
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,853
Sorry, Moshe,
this is for aII of my marbIes.

146
00:08:32,922 --> 00:08:36,153
And, frankIy, you got
too many IiabiIities.

147
00:08:37,526 --> 00:08:39,687
Is this about the reefer incident?

148
00:08:39,762 --> 00:08:41,423
I had no idea
that was marijuana

149
00:08:41,497 --> 00:08:44,261
or I never wouId have Iet
those kids buy it off me.

150
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,028
That's ancient history.

151
00:08:46,102 --> 00:08:48,366
This town is crawIing with
commie-sniffing G-men,

152
00:08:48,437 --> 00:08:51,406
and word is,
you're redder than an Indian's baIIs.

153
00:08:51,474 --> 00:08:53,465
Me?

154
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:54,531
SauI.

155
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,579
No way!
I'm a card-carrying American.

156
00:08:57,646 --> 00:08:59,944
And you can take that to the bank.

157
00:09:00,483 --> 00:09:02,883
- WeII, I joined the party, sure.
- You can keep this.

158
00:09:02,952 --> 00:09:06,786
It's the onIy time your name
wiII ever appear above John GarfieId's.

159
00:09:06,856 --> 00:09:09,347
It was strictIy to meet
nympho-commie chicks.

160
00:09:09,425 --> 00:09:12,792
Which I've aIready paid my debt for,
because...woof.

161
00:09:12,862 --> 00:09:14,659
The part is Guy's.

162
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,288
- Ye--
- Whoa! Whoa!

163
00:09:16,365 --> 00:09:19,698
SIow down. SIow down.
NaturaIIy, we're honored.

164
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:21,464
I get to be Ben Hur!

165
00:09:21,537 --> 00:09:23,937
I was spying.
CongratuIations!

166
00:09:24,006 --> 00:09:26,031
- I get to be Ben Hur!
- It wouId reaIIy depend on your number.

167
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:27,939
I get to be Ben Hur!

168
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,944
- And we did, uh--
- I get to be Ben Hur!

169
00:09:30,012 --> 00:09:33,709
I get to be Ben Hur!
I get to be Ben Hur!

170
00:09:33,783 --> 00:09:35,182
I'm fine.

171
00:09:36,852 --> 00:09:39,116
How's about 50 sound?

172
00:09:39,188 --> 00:09:41,656
There isn't any butter on this,
is there?

173
00:09:41,724 --> 00:09:44,716
There hasn't been a stick of butter
in this house

174
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:47,592
since you dragged
that trainee miIkman upstairs.

175
00:09:47,663 --> 00:09:49,187
- HeIIo?
- Is that Jerry?

176
00:09:49,265 --> 00:09:52,996
- Or birds cooing.
- In here, ma'am.

177
00:09:53,068 --> 00:09:55,593
You know I hate it
when you caII me that.

178
00:09:55,671 --> 00:09:57,696
I find it a stretch, myseIf.

179
00:09:57,773 --> 00:10:01,937
- Jerry, why are you--
- Dressed so nice?

180
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:03,069
Here.

181
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,775
You said you wanted
to ceIebrate ''Ben Hur.''

182
00:10:06,849 --> 00:10:10,080
Oh. I compIeteIy forgot.
I have a thing.

183
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:14,020
Yes, he's going to The Avenue to meet
a saIes cIerk or maybe a waiter.

184
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:18,389
WeII, as Iong as he's not keeping any
of my secrets, one of his baIIs was bIown off.

185
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,451
- Guy, you--
- Have to stop going there.

186
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:22,292
- You do. You're--
- Too famous now.

187
00:10:22,364 --> 00:10:24,730
- You are.
- What's the point of being famous

188
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,701
if you can't use it to get Iaid?

189
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,931
What are we going to do with him?

190
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,872
Sir, your one true spirituaI,
inteIIectuaI and physicaI match

191
00:10:32,942 --> 00:10:35,433
wiII not be Ioitering around
some gay bar.

192
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:36,842
He's much harder to find.

193
00:10:36,912 --> 00:10:39,380
TeII me about it.
And I need five or six of them a week.

194
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:42,349
I used to think Iike him.

195
00:10:42,418 --> 00:10:44,010
Then, when I was overseas,

196
00:10:44,086 --> 00:10:45,383
I met Timothy.

197
00:10:45,454 --> 00:10:47,115
Your company cook.

198
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:50,647
Somehow I can't picture you
in the army.

199
00:10:54,997 --> 00:10:56,021
Okay, go on.

200
00:10:59,268 --> 00:11:01,896
Timothy shared my passion
for opera...

201
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:04,501
cooking...

202
00:11:05,774 --> 00:11:07,469
uniforms.

203
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,775
He showed me that true Iove
reaIIy does exist,

204
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:16,142
even if, tragicaIIy,

205
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:19,984
it was not meant to be
for the two of us.

206
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:21,716
Was he kiIIed?

207
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,651
He got fat.

208
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:29,789
Oh, God!

209
00:11:36,772 --> 00:11:38,603
Hey, baby, you wanna--

210
00:11:38,674 --> 00:11:41,268
Oh, never mind.

211
00:11:41,343 --> 00:11:43,834
Evening, VioIa.
How's business?

212
00:11:43,913 --> 00:11:46,006
Three so far today.

213
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:47,708
Amateur.

214
00:11:52,354 --> 00:11:54,948
- What's the password?
- Scarecrow.

215
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,356
Jeff...BiII.

216
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:02,158
Jeff.

217
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:04,062
Tony.

218
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:05,532
Other Jeff.

219
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:09,063
Guy, Guy, Guy.

220
00:12:09,138 --> 00:12:10,935
- Cape Cod?
- You know me too weII.

221
00:12:11,006 --> 00:12:14,442
So who's the Iucky winner tonight?

222
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,569
Troy! Hi.

223
00:12:17,713 --> 00:12:20,477
Ding ding ding ding ding
ding ding ding ding!

224
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,917
I thought you Iiked 'em
young, dumb and bIond?

225
00:12:23,986 --> 00:12:26,716
WeII, variety is the spice of Iife.

226
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:31,287
Hi.

227
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,828
So, uh, what's your name?

228
00:12:33,896 --> 00:12:35,955
- Jeff.
- That's gonna be a probIem.

229
00:12:36,031 --> 00:12:37,521
HeIIo, poIice?

230
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:40,124
I'm near a bar at the corner
of Hyperion and Rowena.

231
00:12:40,202 --> 00:12:44,332
Perverts are swarming the pIace
and I'm worried for our chiIdren.

232
00:12:44,406 --> 00:12:47,773
Fine, then I'm worried for our hookers.
You comin' or not?

233
00:12:50,112 --> 00:12:52,103
Hey, baby.
You want a date?

234
00:12:53,015 --> 00:12:54,983
- No, but I'II take a bIow job.
- I'II take a ten.

235
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,540
- Five.
- Ten.

236
00:12:56,618 --> 00:12:57,744
- Eight-fifty.
- Ten.

237
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,014
- Nine twenty-five.
- Ten.

238
00:12:59,088 --> 00:13:00,020
Okay.

239
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:02,922
ReaIIy? A saIes cIerk?

240
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:05,324
I tried to be a veterinarian,

241
00:13:05,394 --> 00:13:08,625
but they onIy hire peopIe
that went to coIIege for it.

242
00:13:08,697 --> 00:13:10,756
- Is he smart yet?
- Just keep 'em comin'.

243
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,528
Yes, mommy!

244
00:13:15,137 --> 00:13:17,605
- PIease stop.
- Not tiII they're gone.

245
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:19,470
Okay, they're gone.

246
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,941
Being a movie star
is kind of interesting too.

247
00:13:22,011 --> 00:13:25,378
- Beat it, you whore!
- Excuse me?

248
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:28,510
PoIice! Everybody freeze!

249
00:13:32,087 --> 00:13:34,317
Ow! Oh! Oh!

250
00:13:38,594 --> 00:13:41,654
- Oh!
- Hey, you! Freeze!

251
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:48,961
Oh!

252
00:13:52,941 --> 00:13:54,408
HoId that.
SmiIe!

253
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,568
TerribIe Iighting for me.

254
00:13:56,645 --> 00:14:00,046
Oh, yes, Guy, that's why we're
aII so concerned.

255
00:14:00,115 --> 00:14:01,605
Like your office buiIding?

256
00:14:01,683 --> 00:14:04,243
It's fine.
For God's sake, why?

257
00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:08,449
Because next year this whoIe Iot
wiII be nothing but new ones.

258
00:14:08,524 --> 00:14:10,651
Okay, here's why this is good--

259
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:15,095
This is good. ''The HeraId''
goes to press in two hours.

260
00:14:15,164 --> 00:14:18,361
With what? It's not Iike
he's naked in a man's arms.

261
00:14:18,434 --> 00:14:21,164
Yeah, weII, they got a record.
You pIay aIong with it.

262
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:23,295
Oh, a c-note wipes that out.

263
00:14:23,372 --> 00:14:26,603
And ''The HeraId''?
WeII, you just trade 'em something better.

264
00:14:26,675 --> 00:14:28,973
For instance?

265
00:14:29,044 --> 00:14:31,512
For instance, um...

266
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,707
WeII, you teII 'em, uh...

267
00:14:35,484 --> 00:14:37,782
Betty Bright is addicted
to smack.

268
00:14:37,853 --> 00:14:39,115
Is that true?

269
00:14:39,188 --> 00:14:41,588
WeII, it wiII be
once this kiIIs her career.

270
00:14:41,657 --> 00:14:44,182
And Guy wiII have Iearned
his Iesson,

271
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,750
which means he won't be making
the same mistake

272
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:48,558
when he is doing ''Ben Hur.''

273
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,121
He is not doing ''Ben Hur.''

274
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,189
Excuse me?

275
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:56,727
I'm not going to sink
1 .05 miIIion doIIars in a vehicIe

276
00:14:56,805 --> 00:14:58,898
for the new Miss America.

277
00:15:02,544 --> 00:15:04,068
They Iook aIike.

278
00:15:04,146 --> 00:15:07,912
You know, Guy,
if my career were over--

279
00:15:07,983 --> 00:15:09,280
Wait a second.

280
00:15:09,351 --> 00:15:11,478
You're my onIy reaI cIient.

281
00:15:11,553 --> 00:15:13,453
My career is over!

282
00:15:13,522 --> 00:15:15,786
- You'II think of something this time.
- Not this time.

283
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:17,291
- It's different.
- It is.

284
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:19,657
I couIdn't heIp you right now if...

285
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,554
ToId ya.

286
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:30,037
- What if he got married?
- Married? But he's a--

287
00:15:30,105 --> 00:15:32,437
America's most eIigibIe bacheIor.

288
00:15:32,508 --> 00:15:35,068
Now you know ''The HeraId''
wiII take that trade.

289
00:15:35,144 --> 00:15:38,671
PIus, it'II KO any gay taIk
with one punch.

290
00:15:38,747 --> 00:15:39,873
Wait, sIow down.

291
00:15:39,948 --> 00:15:41,882
First of aII, marry who?

292
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:46,944
Because I promise you,
any two-bit starIet wiII stab us in the back.

293
00:15:47,022 --> 00:15:48,455
Fruit?

294
00:15:52,227 --> 00:15:55,196
I'II just Ieave this right here.

295
00:15:55,264 --> 00:15:57,232
- Hi, Guy.
- Hey, kiddo.

296
00:15:58,233 --> 00:15:59,757
''Kiddo!''

297
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:02,770
WeII, she is honest.

298
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:05,033
- She's trustworthy.
- ExactIy.

299
00:16:05,107 --> 00:16:08,008
She's not that kind of girI.

300
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,543
- Why does she have to be in on it?
- What?

301
00:16:14,616 --> 00:16:18,074
WeII, she's obviousIy
crazy about you.

302
00:16:18,153 --> 00:16:19,347
WeII, maybe, but Jerry--

303
00:16:19,421 --> 00:16:22,822
DefiniteIy!
HeII, she wouId say ''yes''

304
00:16:22,891 --> 00:16:24,825
if he asked her right now.

305
00:16:25,894 --> 00:16:27,156
- DeaI.
- What?

306
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:30,096
Stone marries her tonight
and he can keep ''Ben Hur.''

307
00:16:30,165 --> 00:16:33,066
If not, you'II Iet me out
of his contract.

308
00:16:33,135 --> 00:16:36,400
SaIIy, get in here.

309
00:16:36,471 --> 00:16:37,961
''Right now'' is an expression.

310
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,999
Yeah, so is ''homo star arrested
in perv paIace.''

311
00:16:47,849 --> 00:16:49,180
Uh, Jerry.

312
00:16:49,251 --> 00:16:50,684
- What?
- This!

313
00:16:50,752 --> 00:16:53,846
It wouId be one thing if she were in on it,
but she's a human being.

314
00:16:53,922 --> 00:16:58,052
Oh, weII, you picked a heII of a time
to start noticing that about peopIe.

315
00:16:58,126 --> 00:16:59,855
PIus, which, I'd have to pIay aIong.

316
00:16:59,928 --> 00:17:03,420
Can you imagine day after day
of Iistening to an endIess stream

317
00:17:03,498 --> 00:17:05,591
of superficiaI bIather?

318
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:07,567
WeII, that's your job.

319
00:17:09,504 --> 00:17:12,996
PIus, which, so is protecting me
from these sort of things.

320
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:17,535
Oh! Oh, Guy, that is reaIIy
an exceIIent point.

321
00:17:17,613 --> 00:17:21,208
You know, if I couId just
eIaborate on that a IittIe bit.

322
00:17:22,784 --> 00:17:24,149
You grow the heII up

323
00:17:24,219 --> 00:17:26,813
and you make this work,
do you understand?

324
00:17:26,888 --> 00:17:30,449
I did not buiId
an A+ movie career

325
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:33,926
out of a smiIe and a head of hair
just to have you

326
00:17:33,996 --> 00:17:36,123
smash it to bits
with your prick!

327
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:42,431
But you're not a Iesbian.

328
00:17:42,504 --> 00:17:45,098
He does?
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

329
00:17:45,173 --> 00:17:47,334
You wanted to see me?

330
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:51,307
Oh, SaIIy.

331
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,476
Guy has something
he needs to ask you.

332
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,142
QuickIy.

333
00:17:57,219 --> 00:17:58,811
What is it?

334
00:18:00,055 --> 00:18:02,023
Nothing. Sit down.

335
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,785
ReaIIy?

336
00:18:04,893 --> 00:18:08,659
I just thought we shouId taIk.

337
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:12,131
What couId I possibIy
have to say that wouId interest you?

338
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,600
I have no idea.

339
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,434
- Um, what do you do for fun?
- Watch Guy Stone movies.

340
00:18:17,506 --> 00:18:19,337
ReaIIy? Me too.

341
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:24,645
Oh, and I'm taking an acting cIass
from the prestigious Tom Hertz.

342
00:18:24,713 --> 00:18:27,477
- Ah, sure. Tom.
- You take from him?

343
00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:30,245
Sometimes I'm the student,
sometimes I'm the teacher.

344
00:18:31,386 --> 00:18:33,616
So, you wanna be an actress?

345
00:18:33,689 --> 00:18:36,453
Oh, gosh, no.
Actresses are whores.

346
00:18:36,525 --> 00:18:38,618
But you're not--
a whore, I mean!

347
00:18:38,694 --> 00:18:41,720
Not an actress. Wait.
You're not that either.

348
00:18:41,797 --> 00:18:43,162
Listen to me.

349
00:18:43,231 --> 00:18:47,600
You caII me in here
and I'm doin' aII the taIking.

350
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:51,799
From here on out,
just think of my mouth as a third ear.

351
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,002
- Listen--
- Okay.

352
00:18:56,044 --> 00:18:57,807
I'm just gonna come cIean.

353
00:19:09,825 --> 00:19:11,918
I Iove you!

354
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:16,898
- You Iove me?
- From the day we met.

355
00:19:16,965 --> 00:19:18,694
- JuIy 16, 1953.
- Right.

356
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:19,893
- At the commissary.
- Right.

357
00:19:19,968 --> 00:19:21,868
You had the coId cut pIate with the...

358
00:19:21,937 --> 00:19:25,429
- Guy Stone Ioves me.
- SureIy you suspected?

359
00:19:25,507 --> 00:19:29,170
No, I mean, I aIways fantasized,
but honestIy, before today,

360
00:19:29,244 --> 00:19:31,269
I didn't even think
you knew I existed.

361
00:19:31,346 --> 00:19:32,870
How can you say that?

362
00:19:32,948 --> 00:19:37,248
Whenever you come see Mr. Ornstein,
you just waIk right by me without Iooking.

363
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:40,811
- It hurts too much.
- You don't even say ''hi'' on the phone.

364
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:43,153
I'm afraid I'II say, ''Hi Iove you.''

365
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:45,159
And you can never remember
my name.

366
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:46,888
Don't be siIIy.

367
00:19:49,498 --> 00:19:51,864
I was going to say it sIowIy

368
00:19:52,134 --> 00:19:53,294
and savor it.

369
00:19:53,368 --> 00:19:56,826
Oh, Guy. I Iove you too.
I aIways have.

370
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,429
So marry me.

371
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:03,006
- You're proposing?
- Oh, pIease, say yes.

372
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:05,945
Or don't you reaIIy Iove me
after aII?

373
00:20:06,014 --> 00:20:07,641
No! I mean, yes!

374
00:20:07,716 --> 00:20:10,776
It's just--
We've never even been on a date.

375
00:20:10,852 --> 00:20:14,310
Hasn't every one of my movies
been a sort of date?

376
00:20:14,389 --> 00:20:18,018
You fought wars with me.
You've been to Europe with me.

377
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:22,757
You've...coached a chimp quarterback
with me.

378
00:20:23,465 --> 00:20:25,456
How many more dates do we need

379
00:20:25,534 --> 00:20:27,832
to confirm what we both
aIready know so weII?

380
00:20:27,903 --> 00:20:30,428
This is just Iike in
''I Married the Ghost''

381
00:20:30,505 --> 00:20:34,100
where you asked the countess to marry you
from right there on the gaIIows!

382
00:20:34,176 --> 00:20:37,270
- That's exactIy how I feeI right now.
- Me too.

383
00:20:37,345 --> 00:20:38,972
Oh, SaIIy!

384
00:20:39,047 --> 00:20:41,072
- Yeah?
- Be my husband!

385
00:20:41,149 --> 00:20:42,173
Wife!

386
00:20:44,186 --> 00:20:45,619
Son of a bitch.

387
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,122
There oughta be a Iaw
against driving that drunk.

388
00:20:54,196 --> 00:20:56,562
- Come on.
- Do we have to do this tonight?

389
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:59,122
- I aIways wanted a big wedding.
- His Iove won't wait.

390
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:01,135
- What she said.
- Look, fIowers!

391
00:21:01,203 --> 00:21:02,830
...to be your lawfully wedded husband.

392
00:21:02,904 --> 00:21:05,930
To Iove, honor and obey
so Iong as you both may Iive?

393
00:21:06,007 --> 00:21:07,440
I do.

394
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:09,238
And do you...

395
00:21:11,012 --> 00:21:12,639
Guy.

396
00:21:12,714 --> 00:21:15,410
Oh, hey, Brent!

397
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:16,416
Guy!

398
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:18,146
He's fine. Come on!

399
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,915
I can change him.

400
00:21:20,722 --> 00:21:24,283
...the swinging pad
of America's most happily married,

401
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:29,194
ex-bachelor,
movie star Guy Stonel

402
00:21:29,264 --> 00:21:31,095
We love you, Guyl

403
00:21:56,892 --> 00:21:58,382
Ahhhh!

404
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,794
Oh, did I scare you,
my darIing husband?

405
00:22:04,432 --> 00:22:05,831
Your what?

406
00:22:05,901 --> 00:22:08,426
I know.
I can't beIieve it either.

407
00:22:08,503 --> 00:22:11,529
I keep pinching myseIf
to see if I'm dreaming.

408
00:22:12,641 --> 00:22:14,541
Any Iuck?

409
00:22:14,609 --> 00:22:16,873
Look, we're even in the paper.

410
00:22:16,945 --> 00:22:20,005
''Guy Stone marries ordinary nobody.''

411
00:22:20,081 --> 00:22:21,776
When was this picture taken?

412
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,148
Last night.
Don't you remember?

413
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,251
Snippets.

414
00:22:26,321 --> 00:22:30,280
WeII, I'II never forget
a singIe moment of the entire evening.

415
00:22:30,358 --> 00:22:33,020
EspeciaIIy that Iast part.

416
00:22:33,094 --> 00:22:35,722
You made me a woman, Guy.

417
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:37,993
I did?

418
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:41,126
It was so wonderfuI.
And you wanna know why?

419
00:22:41,202 --> 00:22:43,727
Because I waited
25 years for it.

420
00:22:43,805 --> 00:22:47,172
WeII, then, that is just the scheduIe
we're gonna stick to.

421
00:22:48,176 --> 00:22:50,701
Now, up, up, up, fast,
Iike a bunny.

422
00:22:54,115 --> 00:22:57,175
- What time is it?
- It's aImost 7:00, Mr. Lazybones.

423
00:22:58,186 --> 00:23:00,552
Whoa, whoa, wait.
Where you goin'?

424
00:23:00,622 --> 00:23:02,055
- Hi, Guy.
- Hi, Gordon.

425
00:23:02,123 --> 00:23:05,422
- You know the SaIvation Army man?
- I do a Iot of charity work.

426
00:23:05,493 --> 00:23:06,824
Thanks a Iot.

427
00:23:06,895 --> 00:23:09,659
- Wait, where is he taking that?
- WeII, who cares? It's just junk.

428
00:23:09,731 --> 00:23:13,167
I tried reasoning with her, but the woman
is impervious to droII remarks.

429
00:23:13,234 --> 00:23:16,135
I'm redoing the entire house
from top to bottom!

430
00:23:16,204 --> 00:23:18,104
Wait, whoa!
Without discussing it?

431
00:23:18,173 --> 00:23:20,607
Men don't know anything
about decorating.

432
00:23:20,675 --> 00:23:22,336
The trash.

433
00:23:23,345 --> 00:23:26,781
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Man.
I don't think it's cocktaiI hour.

434
00:23:27,749 --> 00:23:29,046
Five.

435
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:32,987
Picture ceramic eIephants!

436
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,718
You can't get out of the marriage.

437
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:40,590
Jerryl

438
00:23:40,662 --> 00:23:42,892
She is destroying my house, Jerry.

439
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:45,398
She's giving away my things
and she's aIways hovering

440
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:47,230
with a tray of God-awful lemonade.

441
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:50,999
Your ''Ben Hur'' contract stipuIates
12 months of matrimony.

442
00:23:51,072 --> 00:23:53,165
I'm not going to make it, Jerry.

443
00:23:54,175 --> 00:23:56,973
When we're at home...

444
00:23:57,045 --> 00:23:58,478
she takes advantage.

445
00:23:58,546 --> 00:24:01,379
You sIept with her?
What was it Iike?

446
00:24:01,449 --> 00:24:02,848
TerribIe!

447
00:24:02,917 --> 00:24:06,216
She's a totaI ''bottom.''
Just, at Ieast, book me a picture.

448
00:24:06,287 --> 00:24:10,223
WeII, they sent this awfuI
coaI mining thing, but--

449
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:11,724
HonestIy.

450
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,851
- Why don't you just wait until Ben Hur--
- I'II take it.

451
00:24:13,928 --> 00:24:15,361
Saul will be thrilled.

452
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:18,490
- It starts Monday.
- Monday?

453
00:24:18,566 --> 00:24:20,966
Look, what can I teII you, sport?

454
00:24:21,036 --> 00:24:23,504
You made your bed,
now Iie on it.

455
00:24:25,874 --> 00:24:29,503
- Aren't you hungry?
- Oh, it's just so...

456
00:24:30,578 --> 00:24:32,239
rich.

457
00:24:32,313 --> 00:24:34,713
WeII, good food
sticks to your ribs.

458
00:24:34,783 --> 00:24:37,149
I'm guessin' this wouId stick
to anything.

459
00:24:37,886 --> 00:24:41,652
I thought I'd best serve this
before it fIoats away.

460
00:24:41,723 --> 00:24:44,487
Boy, doesn't that Iook good?

461
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,288
It's my mother's recipe.

462
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:49,125
She aIways said,
''A fat husband can't get far.''

463
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:51,529
She sounds Iike
an amusing creature.

464
00:24:52,567 --> 00:24:55,127
So, I was thinking that

465
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:57,467
after dinner I might go get a drink.

466
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:58,972
Oh, aII right.

467
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,203
Just, quick, Iet me take a bath,
fix my hair and buy a wrap.

468
00:25:02,277 --> 00:25:04,905
Don't go to aII that troubIe.
I'II just go aIone.

469
00:25:04,979 --> 00:25:07,004
It's no troubIe at aII.
A coupIe or three hours.

470
00:25:07,082 --> 00:25:10,051
Yeah, weII, actuaIIy,
I'd prefer to go aIone.

471
00:25:11,186 --> 00:25:14,178
WeII, I won't be here
when you get back.

472
00:25:14,255 --> 00:25:15,745
That'd be super.

473
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:20,057
So, um...

474
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,823
I'II see you tomorrow?

475
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:23,921
My mother warned me
about you.

476
00:25:23,998 --> 00:25:25,989
She said HoIIywood types were eviI

477
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:28,661
and that you'd stay out
aII night womanizing.

478
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:31,706
But I toId her, ''No, not Guy Stone.''

479
00:25:31,773 --> 00:25:35,072
And you couIdn't have been
more right.

480
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:38,470
ApparentIy I couId.

481
00:25:39,981 --> 00:25:43,417
When a husband is not
working or hunting,

482
00:25:43,485 --> 00:25:46,648
he's home
with his wife and famiIy.

483
00:25:46,721 --> 00:25:49,451
Otherwise,
this is no marriage at aII.

484
00:25:50,525 --> 00:25:54,256
And I won't just go through
the motions.

485
00:25:54,329 --> 00:25:57,264
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

486
00:25:57,332 --> 00:25:58,890
Okay.

487
00:25:58,967 --> 00:26:00,594
I'II stay home.

488
00:26:02,403 --> 00:26:04,064
You wiII?

489
00:26:08,143 --> 00:26:09,804
His wife and what?

490
00:26:16,351 --> 00:26:18,683
Do you need anything eIse
before I retire? Good night.

491
00:26:18,753 --> 00:26:22,120
- Is she stiII up?
- I don't know, sir.

492
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,920
She is.
I can sense it.

493
00:26:25,994 --> 00:26:28,053
Waiting for me,
Iike a...

494
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,629
panther.

495
00:26:30,698 --> 00:26:35,362
You know, aII those times I encouraged you
to settIe down with someone,

496
00:26:35,436 --> 00:26:38,303
I imagined certain things
wouId go unsaid.

497
00:26:38,373 --> 00:26:40,204
It's an arrangement.

498
00:26:40,275 --> 00:26:43,176
WeII, it seems a bit
mean-spirited to me.

499
00:26:43,244 --> 00:26:45,872
Subjecting an innocent, young woman
to emotionaI crueIty.

500
00:26:45,947 --> 00:26:49,383
- She gets to Iive in BeverIy HiIIs.
- I was referring to myseIf.

501
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,384
But since you brought it up,

502
00:26:51,452 --> 00:26:55,616
I think the person in aII this
that you are being Ieast fair to is you, sir.

503
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:58,250
Honey, are you coming to bed?

504
00:26:59,861 --> 00:27:04,127
ActuaIIy, Victor, there is one Iast thing
I need you to do for me.

505
00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:06,895
Betty tries to go
but Flint grabs her arm.

506
00:27:06,968 --> 00:27:12,031
''You're the onIy nurse in a hundred miIes
and you're just gonna waIk away?

507
00:27:12,106 --> 00:27:14,939
I knew working women were coId,
but, Iady,

508
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:16,704
you take the cake.''

509
00:27:16,778 --> 00:27:18,370
He strikes her.

510
00:27:18,446 --> 00:27:20,141
''You think I want to go?

511
00:27:20,215 --> 00:27:23,048
I Iove the miners
Iike a mother Ioves her chiIdren.

512
00:27:23,117 --> 00:27:24,744
But my husband forbids it.''

513
00:27:24,819 --> 00:27:27,219
''WeII, of course, that's different.''

514
00:27:27,288 --> 00:27:30,621
''WeII, the vow does say
'Iove, honor and obey.'''

515
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:31,784
It does?

516
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,849
SaIIy!

517
00:27:32,927 --> 00:27:34,986
Sears came!

518
00:27:40,134 --> 00:27:41,192
Ahhhh!

519
00:27:47,108 --> 00:27:48,803
Are you sure you're aII right?

520
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:51,937
You took quite a faII
into that ceramic eIephant.

521
00:27:52,013 --> 00:27:53,810
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.
Sit down.

522
00:27:56,684 --> 00:27:59,949
So if we're gonna be married,
I have a few ruIes.

523
00:28:00,021 --> 00:28:02,046
WeII, of course you do.

524
00:28:02,123 --> 00:28:05,650
- You wear the pants in this house.
- That's true, generaIIy speaking.

525
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:08,890
And ruIe number one is,
no snooping.

526
00:28:08,963 --> 00:28:10,225
No snooping?

527
00:28:10,298 --> 00:28:13,290
I wiII not truck the sort of wife
who's aIways rooting around

528
00:28:13,368 --> 00:28:17,668
through her husband's bedside tabIe drawers
or the crumpIed paper bags behind his suits.

529
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:20,469
- That's a sort of wife?
- Not in my house.

530
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:22,406
Okay.

531
00:28:22,477 --> 00:28:24,911
WeII, now, um, why don't you...

532
00:28:26,281 --> 00:28:30,342
come to bed and you can teII me
the rest of your ruIes from here?

533
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:32,181
Because of ruIe number two.

534
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:33,220
Separate beds.

535
00:28:33,288 --> 00:28:35,779
In fact, separate rooms.

536
00:28:35,857 --> 00:28:37,654
But why?

537
00:28:37,725 --> 00:28:41,217
I just think a man and woman
sIeeping together is ungodIy.

538
00:28:41,296 --> 00:28:44,356
- Even once they're married?
- I'm deepIy reIigious.

539
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:48,596
Oh, weII, then, tomorrow morning
we shouId go to the sunrise service.

540
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:51,468
Which is, not to say, a fanatic.

541
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,768
WeII, I hope that we can
at Ieast share a bed

542
00:28:57,845 --> 00:28:59,676
when we're making babies.

543
00:28:59,747 --> 00:29:00,873
AbsoIuteIy.

544
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:02,314
RuIe number three, no babies.

545
00:29:02,383 --> 00:29:03,907
But, honey...

546
00:29:05,553 --> 00:29:07,248
The Russians have the bomb.

547
00:29:07,322 --> 00:29:10,291
I wiII not bring new Iife
into a worId that's about to end.

548
00:29:10,358 --> 00:29:13,225
But I Iove chiIdren.

549
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:15,319
Do you Iove watching them meIt?

550
00:29:16,331 --> 00:29:20,097
I just.. I don't know what
you expect me to do with aII my time.

551
00:29:20,168 --> 00:29:22,295
WeII, you have your job.

552
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:24,065
Wives don't work.

553
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:26,368
You can't Ieave SauI in the Iurch.

554
00:29:26,441 --> 00:29:28,739
At Ieast finish out the century.

555
00:29:29,277 --> 00:29:30,676
Okay, weII,

556
00:29:30,745 --> 00:29:34,841
I guess the vow does say,
''Iove, honor and obey.''

557
00:29:34,916 --> 00:29:36,383
Yes, it does.

558
00:29:36,451 --> 00:29:39,818
I guess I'II just go sIeep
in the nursery.

559
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:44,583
'Night.

560
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,662
Women need a better agent.

561
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:00,371
Talk about it
Talk about it

562
00:30:00,441 --> 00:30:02,807
- Uh-uh
- Talk about it, talk about it

563
00:30:02,877 --> 00:30:05,141
- Better not
- Talk about it, talk about it

564
00:30:05,213 --> 00:30:07,681
- Mm-mm.
- Talk about it, talk about it

565
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:11,416
SaIIy, I Iove your neckIace.

566
00:30:12,353 --> 00:30:14,150
Thank you, Bernice.

567
00:30:14,222 --> 00:30:17,555
Gee, how Iong have you...
enjoyed soup?

568
00:30:19,327 --> 00:30:23,821
Are there some secrets
that we don't want the others to know

569
00:30:23,898 --> 00:30:27,732
Don't worry about your wife, Torch.
I've aIways Ioved her.

570
00:30:28,736 --> 00:30:30,203
Surprise!

571
00:30:36,978 --> 00:30:39,310
This is the best thing
that ever happened to us.

572
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,008
Your image is totaIIy changing.

573
00:30:43,618 --> 00:30:47,520
Yesterday, got a caII
from John Ford.

574
00:30:47,588 --> 00:30:49,078
John Ford?

575
00:30:49,157 --> 00:30:51,182
Here.
I know.

576
00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:54,251
- I mean, who is that?
- ''HercuIes,'' the director.

577
00:30:54,328 --> 00:30:57,229
The oId vote was 1 1 yea, 16 nay.

578
00:30:57,298 --> 00:30:59,323
But the new one is five to two.

579
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,561
Looks Iike you win, Greid.

580
00:31:01,636 --> 00:31:04,969
AII my pro-union boys just happened
to be in south tunneI

581
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,734
when it coIIapsed.

582
00:31:08,042 --> 00:31:09,339
Why?

583
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,002
Why, why?

584
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:14,913
Damn accident cost me haIf a day.
Now, sign.

585
00:31:14,982 --> 00:31:17,109
Don't do it, Mr. Upwright!

586
00:31:17,185 --> 00:31:19,085
Goodman, you're aIive!

587
00:31:19,153 --> 00:31:21,781
- Yes, most fortunate.
- Surprised to see me, Greid?

588
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:26,020
WeII, it takes more than
200 tons of coaI

589
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:27,891
to crush the workers' spirit!

590
00:31:27,962 --> 00:31:29,429
Recognize this?

591
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:33,158
Go ahead, caII the cops.

592
00:31:33,234 --> 00:31:36,226
We rich types got UncIe Sam
in our back pocket.

593
00:31:36,304 --> 00:31:39,205
WeII, he better crawI out of there
before his nieces and nephews

594
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:41,833
go Iooking for a new uncIe.

595
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:43,740
And give up
their precious freedom?

596
00:31:43,811 --> 00:31:46,609
Know why they caII it ''freedom''?

597
00:31:46,681 --> 00:31:48,649
Because nobody's free!

598
00:31:51,085 --> 00:31:53,178
And that's dumb.

599
00:31:54,088 --> 00:31:55,316
Cut!

600
00:31:55,389 --> 00:31:56,447
Who said that?

601
00:31:56,524 --> 00:31:59,721
No one ever yeIIs ''cut''

602
00:31:59,794 --> 00:32:02,354
on my set but me!

603
00:32:03,431 --> 00:32:05,058
Or SauI.

604
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:06,896
Come on. I'II show you that tattoo.

605
00:32:06,968 --> 00:32:09,493
WeII, if we're breaking,
maybe I'II run Iines with those two extras.

606
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,095
''BIood Mine'' is wrapped for the day.

607
00:32:12,173 --> 00:32:15,665
- I better go teII those two extras.
- I'm shutting this picture down.

608
00:32:15,743 --> 00:32:16,607
Why?

609
00:32:16,677 --> 00:32:19,202
Because I've got red, hungry G-men

610
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,305
crawIing aII over the Iot.

611
00:32:21,382 --> 00:32:23,373
And it's too ''Iefty.''

612
00:32:23,451 --> 00:32:27,114
ApparentIy, somebody tipped
the feds off I'm Latvian

613
00:32:27,188 --> 00:32:32,125
in their secret testimony
Iast Thursday...at 4:00.

614
00:32:32,193 --> 00:32:34,127
Does it stiII hurt?

615
00:32:34,195 --> 00:32:36,459
They said I'd never work again.

616
00:32:36,531 --> 00:32:39,694
- I had to save myseIf.
- By fingering your boss?

617
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:43,398
It's aII a bIur.

618
00:32:43,471 --> 00:32:46,235
I'd better go break the bad news
to those two extras.

619
00:32:48,176 --> 00:32:50,770
If you scrap the picture,
Guy stiII gets paid.

620
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:52,210
Nobody is scrapping anything.

621
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:56,148
We just need to purge the script
of aII the communist hooey.

622
00:32:56,217 --> 00:32:57,878
It's not communist.

623
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,512
It's humanist.

624
00:33:00,588 --> 00:33:03,113
Yeah, weII, the feds get wind of it,

625
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:05,159
they'II ship me back
to ''humanist'' Russian.

626
00:33:05,226 --> 00:33:06,955
- Who's this?
- I'm Rick Foster.

627
00:33:09,864 --> 00:33:13,197
I wrote ''BIood Mine.''

628
00:33:13,267 --> 00:33:15,292
RosenthaI wrote ''BIood Mine''

629
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:17,303
back when he was a Iawyer.

630
00:33:18,639 --> 00:33:20,197
- I wrote the noveI.
- What?

631
00:33:20,274 --> 00:33:22,401
SaIIy-somebody caIIed me
to come down.

632
00:33:22,476 --> 00:33:24,376
WeII, I'm sorry you wasted--

633
00:33:24,445 --> 00:33:27,903
- Go pIay with those two extras.
- TeII the vaIIey I said hi.

634
00:33:27,982 --> 00:33:30,780
WeII, maybe we can get Mr. Foster here
to make the changes.

635
00:33:30,851 --> 00:33:33,183
After aII, we can aIways use
a fresh set of green eyes.

636
00:33:33,254 --> 00:33:36,189
- We need a screenwriter.
- I don't want the job anyway.

637
00:33:36,257 --> 00:33:39,124
What do you mean you don't want the job?
This is a major motion picture.

638
00:33:39,193 --> 00:33:42,162
- This is a major piece of crap.
- Nobody says no to me.

639
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,926
I'II ruin you! You'II never
work in pictures again.

640
00:33:44,999 --> 00:33:48,025
- I don't wanna work in pictures.
- Yeah? WeII, you're gonna!

641
00:33:48,102 --> 00:33:51,230
I'm gonna Ieave now
whiIe you stiII sound insane.

642
00:33:51,305 --> 00:33:52,897
He'II onIy get someone bad.

643
00:33:52,974 --> 00:33:55,943
This way,
you can protect your book.

644
00:33:56,010 --> 00:34:00,071
You got two weeks. Make that one.
I'II need a week to read it.

645
00:34:00,147 --> 00:34:03,514
You can pass the time
shooting the next ''Captain Astro.''

646
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:06,246
SauI, I'm an Oscar-winning director.

647
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,687
I remember. That's the one speech
where you didn't name me.

648
00:34:09,757 --> 00:34:12,055
Guy, we have a Iunch.

649
00:34:12,126 --> 00:34:14,253
Great. Jerry, get the door.

650
00:34:14,328 --> 00:34:17,092
So, uh, why don't you
come by the house Iater

651
00:34:17,164 --> 00:34:19,894
and you can show me
some of your materiaI?

652
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:25,102
I'm makin' a mistake.

653
00:34:28,175 --> 00:34:31,076
So are you.
You've got a good thing going here.

654
00:34:31,145 --> 00:34:34,046
Jerry, I'm a happiIy-married man,
but since you brought it up--

655
00:34:34,115 --> 00:34:36,379
- You don't think that he's--?
- No.

656
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:38,816
Then again,
you don't think you are either.

657
00:34:38,886 --> 00:34:41,821
You cast a spell on me

658
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:44,687
l was blind, but now l see

659
00:34:44,759 --> 00:34:48,092
You work your magic,
that's the key

660
00:34:48,162 --> 00:34:51,256
You wave your wand

661
00:34:51,332 --> 00:34:55,029
And cast a spell on me

662
00:34:57,071 --> 00:34:59,938
Not sure if you hypnotize me

663
00:35:00,007 --> 00:35:02,532
Maybe just mesmerize me

664
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,237
You're so heaIthy.

665
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:07,706
WeII, my body is my tempIe.

666
00:35:08,783 --> 00:35:11,809
Wow, you're certainIy roIIing out
the red carpet.

667
00:35:11,886 --> 00:35:13,854
You have to with writers.

668
00:35:13,921 --> 00:35:15,548
They ruIe HoIIywood.

669
00:35:15,623 --> 00:35:17,318
Now you mustn't be Iate
for Bernice.

670
00:35:17,391 --> 00:35:19,484
I hate her stupid women's group.

671
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,155
Barbara Stanwyck is such a buIIy.
And that Edith Head...

672
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,255
just stares at me.

673
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:28,200
Can't I just stay and watch you work?

674
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:31,971
You reaIIy wouIdn't understand
what we were doing.

675
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:35,975
But I'II teII you aII about it when you get back
no earIier than midnight.

676
00:35:36,043 --> 00:35:38,273
WeII, have fun.

677
00:35:38,346 --> 00:35:39,870
Okay.

678
00:35:39,947 --> 00:35:43,348
Honey, it has to Iast me
the whoIe night.

679
00:35:48,222 --> 00:35:50,053
Mr. Rick Foster.

680
00:35:51,459 --> 00:35:53,086
Va-va-voom.

681
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,560
I couId die.

682
00:35:55,629 --> 00:35:57,392
But, it's IegaI.

683
00:35:57,465 --> 00:35:59,831
I was just about
to caII the cops.

684
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:03,136
Honey, this is Rick Foster,
the writer.

685
00:36:03,204 --> 00:36:04,466
Rick, this is--

686
00:36:04,538 --> 00:36:05,835
SaIIy Stone.

687
00:36:05,906 --> 00:36:07,931
SaIIy Stone, SaIIy Stone,
SaIIy Stone, SaIIy Stone.

688
00:36:08,008 --> 00:36:11,068
- I couId say it a miIIion times.
- In the car.

689
00:36:14,448 --> 00:36:15,972
She's...

690
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,847
certainIy in Iove.

691
00:36:17,918 --> 00:36:22,184
No, that was mostIy for your benefit,
I'm afraid.

692
00:36:22,256 --> 00:36:26,920
At this point, we're IittIe more
than gIorified roommates.

693
00:36:26,994 --> 00:36:28,791
You've been married, what,
three weeks?

694
00:36:28,863 --> 00:36:30,558
And two days.
WouId you Iike something to drink?

695
00:36:30,631 --> 00:36:32,758
A spIash of Moet?

696
00:36:32,833 --> 00:36:34,698
Got a beer?

697
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,767
ProbabIy.

698
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:44,075
- WouId you Iike a gIass?
- PIease.

699
00:36:48,816 --> 00:36:51,410
- Oh, damn.
- What?

700
00:36:51,485 --> 00:36:52,918
SpiIIed on my new shirt.

701
00:36:52,987 --> 00:36:55,080
ActuaIIy, it Iooks Iike you got Iucky there.

702
00:36:55,156 --> 00:36:57,283
That was stiII too cIose
for comfort.

703
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,250
Hey, you're reading my book.

704
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,124
Yeah, yeah, um...

705
00:37:05,733 --> 00:37:09,931
I think it's reaIIy sweet
how you dedicated it to your mother.

706
00:37:10,004 --> 00:37:11,494
WeII, she reaIIy encouraged me.

707
00:37:11,572 --> 00:37:16,271
My whoIe Iife, she's been more Iike
a best friend than a mom.

708
00:37:19,747 --> 00:37:22,443
I think Judy GarIand's great,
don't you?

709
00:37:22,516 --> 00:37:24,074
Am I made of stone?

710
00:37:24,151 --> 00:37:27,314
You know, we're friends.

711
00:37:27,388 --> 00:37:29,049
ReaIIy?

712
00:37:29,123 --> 00:37:32,422
Hey, do you mind
if I turn on the game?

713
00:37:32,493 --> 00:37:33,619
The what?

714
00:37:33,694 --> 00:37:37,027
The OrioIes pIay tonight--
my home team.

715
00:37:40,668 --> 00:37:42,033
I, uh...

716
00:37:42,102 --> 00:37:44,263
I don't reaIIy foIIow footbaII.

717
00:37:44,338 --> 00:37:46,329
BasebaII, sir.

718
00:37:55,216 --> 00:37:56,683
You know...

719
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:01,313
you couId just ask.

720
00:38:01,388 --> 00:38:02,912
Ask what?

721
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,787
If I'm gay.

722
00:38:07,561 --> 00:38:08,892
Are you gay?

723
00:38:10,431 --> 00:38:13,161
- I'm gay.
- I'm gay.

724
00:38:13,234 --> 00:38:15,828
- ReaIIy?
- Hey, I act pIenty straight.

725
00:38:15,903 --> 00:38:18,463
- I even have a wife.
- Yeah, what is that aII about?

726
00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:20,939
- It's HoIIywood.
- That supposed to mean something?

727
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:23,169
We're getting off track here.
We're both gay.

728
00:38:23,244 --> 00:38:25,804
- Custom dictates we have sex now.
- Okay.

729
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,643
I was joking.

730
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:30,449
I don't get it.

731
00:38:30,518 --> 00:38:33,282
Look, I came here to work.

732
00:38:33,354 --> 00:38:35,379
Are you sure you're gay?

733
00:38:35,456 --> 00:38:38,425
And what makes you think
you're even my type?

734
00:38:38,492 --> 00:38:40,119
I'm everybody's type.

735
00:38:40,194 --> 00:38:42,128
I can't beIieve
you actuaIIy said that.

736
00:38:42,196 --> 00:38:45,290
That's not vanity.
That's professionaI pride.

737
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:48,699
It's my job to make every man,
woman and chiId in America

738
00:38:48,769 --> 00:38:50,498
Iove me to pieces.

739
00:38:50,571 --> 00:38:53,062
And I am good at what I do.

740
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,732
So I hear.

741
00:38:55,743 --> 00:38:58,712
Listen, I got a coupIe questions,
then I'II get out of your hair.

742
00:38:58,779 --> 00:39:02,977
First of aII, this screenpIay turns my book
into a ham-fisted meIodrama which I can fix,

743
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:06,247
but I just got this memo from SauI
with aII these changes he wants.

744
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,015
I'm sure they're not so bad.

745
00:39:08,088 --> 00:39:11,888
''Number three,
eIiminate aII references to Iabor unions.''

746
00:39:11,959 --> 00:39:13,119
So?

747
00:39:13,193 --> 00:39:14,922
Did you read my book?

748
00:39:15,596 --> 00:39:18,565
- I'm reading it.
- Where are you?

749
00:39:18,632 --> 00:39:19,894
Dedication.

750
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:23,961
It's the story of coaI miners
struggIing to unionize.

751
00:39:24,038 --> 00:39:27,496
I take that out and aII that's Ieft
is the romance between you and the shop girI,

752
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:29,736
who-- oh,
he wants to make a countess.

753
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:31,937
So you Ieave aII the Iabor stuff in

754
00:39:32,012 --> 00:39:35,948
and you change the word ''union''
to Ieague or guiId or something.

755
00:39:36,016 --> 00:39:38,246
What--
are you stupid enough to faII for that?

756
00:39:38,319 --> 00:39:40,082
Oh, wait, I forgot where I am.

757
00:39:40,154 --> 00:39:42,816
- You're kind of a hypocrite.
- Me? You're the one with a wife.

758
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,949
That's right.
Fans want me straight.

759
00:39:45,025 --> 00:39:47,425
So I can either be straight
or go into another Iine,

760
00:39:47,494 --> 00:39:51,897
just Iike you can either consider yourseIf
above HoIIywood or take our money.

761
00:39:51,966 --> 00:39:54,526
I didn't want this job.
You're the one that taIked me into it.

762
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:56,536
I said two sentences.

763
00:39:56,604 --> 00:39:59,937
You're that much of a pushover,
we shouId be having sex right now.

764
00:40:11,418 --> 00:40:13,477
I need some air.

765
00:40:16,256 --> 00:40:19,692
- Do you require anything eIse?
- You, gone.

766
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,057
Va-va-voom.

767
00:40:33,207 --> 00:40:36,335
- Nice Iife you got going here.
- I suppose so.

768
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:40,107
But the truth is,
I'd give it up in a heartbeat

769
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,375
for something even more Iavish.

770
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:47,246
It's okay to Iaugh, you know.

771
00:40:47,321 --> 00:40:51,417
You're Iike a Iesbian
trapped in a gay man's body.

772
00:40:52,259 --> 00:40:54,523
There's a start.

773
00:40:54,595 --> 00:40:57,496
Yeah, it's aIso okay
to take things seriousIy.

774
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,704
SaIIy pIants these.

775
00:41:09,143 --> 00:41:10,542
Does she know...

776
00:41:12,279 --> 00:41:14,144
that it's ''HoIIywood''?

777
00:41:18,052 --> 00:41:19,679
I hope so.

778
00:41:20,821 --> 00:41:23,051
I teII myseIf things about that too.

779
00:41:24,925 --> 00:41:28,861
LateIy I Iike,
''WeII, she feII in Iove with me pIaying roIes,

780
00:41:28,929 --> 00:41:31,523
so this must be
what she reaIIy wants.''

781
00:41:34,301 --> 00:41:36,997
That's...sort of true.

782
00:41:38,472 --> 00:41:40,133
Best ones are.

783
00:41:50,117 --> 00:41:52,142
I don't understand this pIace.

784
00:41:54,688 --> 00:41:56,918
Someone once said that onIy a few peopIe

785
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:00,949
couId hoId the entire equation of pictures
in their head.

786
00:42:02,162 --> 00:42:04,426
F. Scott FitzgeraId.

787
00:42:06,834 --> 00:42:10,793
Guess that kid in the car wash men's room
was a big reader.

788
00:42:12,272 --> 00:42:14,832
You are everything
that I make fun of.

789
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:16,967
I know.

790
00:42:17,044 --> 00:42:19,478
This must be heII for you.

791
00:42:42,402 --> 00:42:45,235
I shouId get back to the reaI worId.

792
00:42:49,777 --> 00:42:51,176
Where you going?

793
00:42:52,913 --> 00:42:55,939
I thought maybe we couId...

794
00:42:56,016 --> 00:42:59,110
I don't mess around
on the first date.

795
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:05,915
Are you sure you're gay?

796
00:43:13,834 --> 00:43:14,766
Wow.

797
00:43:14,835 --> 00:43:18,464
Yeah, kid. I remember being
on my first HoIIywood set.

798
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:20,473
You guys make a bunch of junk.

799
00:43:20,541 --> 00:43:22,634
My pa-in-Iaw had a saying.

800
00:43:22,709 --> 00:43:27,373
At S.R.O. we might not have
the big budgets of the other guys.

801
00:43:27,447 --> 00:43:29,381
Hey, what's with the bIue Iight?

802
00:43:29,449 --> 00:43:30,882
That means we're fiIming.

803
00:43:30,951 --> 00:43:35,217
Used to be red, but I had them change it out.
I didn't want peopIe to get the wrong idea.

804
00:43:35,289 --> 00:43:38,156
I support everything
you McCarthy boys are doing.

805
00:43:38,225 --> 00:43:41,888
- I'm not with McCarthy.
- Good. That grandstanding opportunist.

806
00:43:41,962 --> 00:43:45,159
You know his whoIe thing of working peopIe up
about HoIIywood Reds so he can show off,

807
00:43:45,232 --> 00:43:47,063
dragging some headIine-grabbing names
through the mud?

808
00:43:47,134 --> 00:43:48,761
- A tragic, dark day.
- That was mine.

809
00:43:48,836 --> 00:43:49,825
Hat's off.

810
00:43:49,903 --> 00:43:52,394
I have too many highbaIIs
one night at some party,

811
00:43:52,472 --> 00:43:55,032
start shooting my mouth off
Iike an idiot.

812
00:43:55,108 --> 00:43:58,976
You couId actuaIIy see Joe's ears prick up,
and now Iook at him.

813
00:43:59,046 --> 00:44:01,674
OnIy I'm not giving up without a fight.

814
00:44:01,748 --> 00:44:04,546
- I just need something big to compete.
- Sure, a showstopper.

815
00:44:04,618 --> 00:44:08,577
- A set-piece. I get ya.
- Right. Like shutting down a whoIe studio.

816
00:44:08,655 --> 00:44:11,590
Whoa, Ray, no, no, no!

817
00:44:11,658 --> 00:44:13,626
That's way too big.

818
00:44:13,694 --> 00:44:17,460
You gotta buiId to that sIowIy.

819
00:44:17,531 --> 00:44:19,499
Otherwise you never top yourseIf.

820
00:44:19,566 --> 00:44:21,727
Okay, then how about you fork over
some big, fat Red star

821
00:44:21,802 --> 00:44:23,929
that I can griII on my own TV inquest?

822
00:44:24,004 --> 00:44:28,373
Ray, at S.R.O., we're Iike a famiIy.

823
00:44:28,442 --> 00:44:31,570
- You have a phone in there I can use?
- Not a cIose famiIy.

824
00:44:32,946 --> 00:44:34,311
What the heII is this?

825
00:44:34,381 --> 00:44:38,647
I figure, they're on a spaceship--
the computer wouId be smaII.

826
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:43,588
Captain Astro Iives in the year 1996,
not 4 biIIion A.D., dumb nuts.

827
00:44:44,925 --> 00:44:46,950
Let's get this over with.

828
00:44:47,027 --> 00:44:52,055
UnIess the good Iord wouId do me the favor
of dropping a kIieg Iight on top of me.

829
00:44:52,132 --> 00:44:54,464
- Sorry.
- He did that intentionaIIy.

830
00:44:54,534 --> 00:44:56,092
Yeah, no kidding, Oscar boy.

831
00:44:56,169 --> 00:44:59,263
Around here we happen to take
''Captain Astro'' pretty seriousIy.

832
00:45:00,274 --> 00:45:02,071
I'm sure that's just the reefer taIking.

833
00:45:02,142 --> 00:45:05,077
Hey, I haven't had a hit since 1947.

834
00:45:05,545 --> 00:45:06,842
Which makes two of us.

835
00:45:08,415 --> 00:45:09,643
Enjoy TV.

836
00:45:09,716 --> 00:45:14,813
So, Wanda straps you in the proton chair,

837
00:45:14,888 --> 00:45:17,356
facing...Lizardo.

838
00:45:18,859 --> 00:45:20,759
Oh, I get it.

839
00:45:22,129 --> 00:45:26,031
Does any part of him move?
Of course not.

840
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:27,930
Then you say...

841
00:45:28,001 --> 00:45:30,936
Lizardo knows Iots.

842
00:45:31,004 --> 00:45:33,768
Knows aII--
CIose enough.

843
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,865
Then Lizardo says...

844
00:45:35,943 --> 00:45:37,672
Is the mouth effect working?

845
00:45:37,744 --> 00:45:41,271
Oh, yeah, it's sweII.
It scared the heck out of my mother.

846
00:45:41,348 --> 00:45:43,316
Lizardo says...

847
00:45:43,383 --> 00:45:45,146
We eat chiIdren.

848
00:45:45,919 --> 00:45:47,318
Jesus!

849
00:45:49,122 --> 00:45:52,455
- Just Iike mother's wig.
- The fIames are supposed to Iick.

850
00:45:52,526 --> 00:45:55,757
Yeah, weII, the doohickey fritzed out.

851
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:58,258
That shouId do it.

852
00:45:58,332 --> 00:46:00,459
Very good.
PIaces peopIe.

853
00:46:00,534 --> 00:46:03,765
- Don't you want to do a test?
- I'm good.

854
00:46:03,837 --> 00:46:05,828
Are you?

855
00:46:05,906 --> 00:46:07,567
I'm good too.

856
00:46:08,809 --> 00:46:09,741
And...

857
00:46:11,311 --> 00:46:15,111
Turns out you slept
with a friend of mine. Jason?

858
00:46:15,182 --> 00:46:20,313
- l've slept with a lot of Jasons.
- Jason Clodfelter.

859
00:46:20,387 --> 00:46:22,719
l've slept with a lot of Jason Clodfelters.

860
00:46:22,789 --> 00:46:24,017
- Finished, sir?
- Yes.

861
00:46:24,091 --> 00:46:26,321
It's ''Rick.''

862
00:46:26,393 --> 00:46:28,224
No, Iet him caII you ''sir,''

863
00:46:28,295 --> 00:46:30,786
otherwise he bIows his paycheck
on escorts.

864
00:46:32,366 --> 00:46:35,130
Victor, you're from Georgia, right?

865
00:46:35,202 --> 00:46:37,466
If your intention is to comment
on the irony that

866
00:46:37,537 --> 00:46:41,974
my forbearers heId sIaves
whiIe I now am one, I've heard it.

867
00:46:42,042 --> 00:46:46,274
No, I was more just curious
what a native thought of FIannery O'Connor.

868
00:46:49,149 --> 00:46:50,275
I'm sorry, did I...

869
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:54,013
No, it's just that, as a ruIe,
Mr. Stone's IittIe friends don't speak of books

870
00:46:54,087 --> 00:46:56,021
unIess they want to coIor.

871
00:46:57,057 --> 00:46:59,082
Must be something around here
that needs cIeaning.

872
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:02,822
Not Iike in the oId days. Coffee?

873
00:47:02,896 --> 00:47:04,989
Can you excuse me for a sec?

874
00:47:09,369 --> 00:47:12,338
You know he'II never be abIe
to cook Iike me.

875
00:47:12,406 --> 00:47:15,000
And who knows how he'II Iet you Ieave
the house Iooking.

876
00:47:15,075 --> 00:47:16,975
Victor, I'm aIready married.

877
00:47:18,745 --> 00:47:22,044
Besides, I think today is it for us.

878
00:47:22,115 --> 00:47:23,742
Don't teII me you're seriousIy con--

879
00:47:23,817 --> 00:47:26,684
I'm just not buiIt for this.

880
00:47:26,753 --> 00:47:29,051
I mean, approaching guys, I know.

881
00:47:29,122 --> 00:47:30,851
I have an objective--
to sIeep with them.

882
00:47:30,924 --> 00:47:33,119
A motivation-- I'm horny.
But with Rick--

883
00:47:33,193 --> 00:47:34,421
Sir...

884
00:47:35,295 --> 00:47:36,523
if I may...

885
00:47:38,665 --> 00:47:42,965
Mr. Foster is a man of much higher caIiber
than you deserve.

886
00:47:43,036 --> 00:47:45,869
If I were you, I'd stop worrying about
how to cut him Ioose,

887
00:47:45,939 --> 00:47:48,407
and I'd start worrying about
how to keep him.

888
00:47:48,475 --> 00:47:52,571
Because Ietting him go wiII be a mistake
that wiII haunt you untiI your miserabIe,

889
00:47:52,646 --> 00:47:55,137
IoneIy, aIcohoI-soaked death.

890
00:48:00,887 --> 00:48:04,050
Coffee wouId be fine.

891
00:48:04,124 --> 00:48:05,614
Right away.

892
00:48:09,763 --> 00:48:11,697
I got Iost.

893
00:48:13,033 --> 00:48:16,298
There's one in the cabana.
You want to go for a swim?

894
00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:19,532
l wanna show you my backyard.

895
00:48:21,741 --> 00:48:22,765
Ow!

896
00:48:22,843 --> 00:48:25,107
My fauIt.

897
00:48:25,178 --> 00:48:26,805
Oh! Ow!

898
00:48:28,849 --> 00:48:31,147
- HeIp me!
- Get away!

899
00:48:31,218 --> 00:48:33,482
I'm burning! Ahhh!

900
00:48:36,323 --> 00:48:38,883
Stupid, god-damned--
Ugh!

901
00:48:42,729 --> 00:48:45,163
You wanna keep Iooking?

902
00:48:51,204 --> 00:48:53,035
Very cozy.

903
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,769
It used to be a deIi.

904
00:48:55,842 --> 00:48:58,242
My pIace used to be
a coupIe of farms.

905
00:48:59,312 --> 00:49:02,770
- What's with the costume?
- In the reaI worId they're caIIed uniforms.

906
00:49:02,849 --> 00:49:05,044
- You're a maiIman?
- What's wrong with that?

907
00:49:05,118 --> 00:49:09,282
In order for a society to work, aII its peopIe
have to Iabor for a common good.

908
00:49:09,356 --> 00:49:12,382
You sound Iike a communist.

909
00:49:12,459 --> 00:49:15,087
- I am a communist.
- ReaIIy? Me too.

910
00:49:15,162 --> 00:49:17,892
Guy, communism is a reaction to you.

911
00:49:17,964 --> 00:49:22,401
Yeah, I found out.
Where do they get off caIIing it a party?

912
00:49:23,737 --> 00:49:25,967
Oh, those are nothing.

913
00:49:31,278 --> 00:49:33,644
When I was young,

914
00:49:33,713 --> 00:49:36,773
I use to give them to my boyfriends when...

915
00:49:37,918 --> 00:49:39,681
when things got serious.

916
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:43,421
When you were young?

917
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:47,221
Don't worry, I stopped.
You just get 'em back.

918
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:51,520
I used to give out coffee mugs,
but it got too expensive.

919
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,761
I got another memo from SauI today.

920
00:49:55,835 --> 00:49:58,065
''League'' is out. I'm trying ''coaIition.''

921
00:49:58,138 --> 00:50:02,131
- WeII, do I stiII get the countess?
- Shop girI. And yes.

922
00:50:02,209 --> 00:50:03,471
Then we're fine.

923
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:06,011
Give peopIe a cute romance
and they're happy.

924
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:10,379
Art can be so much more than cute.
Art can change the worId. I'm serious.

925
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:14,147
An idea or an image
presented exactIy the right way

926
00:50:14,221 --> 00:50:15,711
can aIter someone forever.

927
00:50:16,957 --> 00:50:20,586
SauI has a saying--
''If you have a message, you're fired.''

928
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:22,992
SauI treats the audience Iike morons.

929
00:50:23,063 --> 00:50:26,726
- WeII, they don't seem to mind.
- Because they don't know any better.

930
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,098
Movies are the biggest soapbox ever buiIt,

931
00:50:29,169 --> 00:50:31,535
but everyone on it's too concerned
about money or their tan.

932
00:50:31,605 --> 00:50:32,731
Rick, we're different!

933
00:50:32,806 --> 00:50:35,673
We knew that going in.
So why is this suddenIy such a probIem?

934
00:50:35,742 --> 00:50:37,073
Because...

935
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:41,342
I Iove you.

936
00:50:43,516 --> 00:50:44,505
Rick...

937
00:50:44,584 --> 00:50:48,247
I shouIdn't have said that.
Forget it.

938
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:52,253
I'm just not buiIt for this.

939
00:50:52,325 --> 00:50:53,952
Someone reguIar...

940
00:50:54,027 --> 00:50:56,427
Just...shut up.
Okay?

941
00:50:59,966 --> 00:51:01,627
And I Iove you too.

942
00:51:09,309 --> 00:51:10,742
What the heII?

943
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:13,643
It's Guy's birthday present.

944
00:51:13,713 --> 00:51:18,116
They're oodIes of fun at parties.
I needed somepIace to hide it.

945
00:51:18,184 --> 00:51:20,880
A Iot fuII of empty stages
and you pick here?

946
00:51:20,954 --> 00:51:23,013
WeII, this is just
where they deIivered it.

947
00:51:23,089 --> 00:51:27,685
I was gonna move it myseIf, but it was too heavy
on account of I had it done in waInut,

948
00:51:27,761 --> 00:51:30,855
because that's more mascuIine.

949
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:33,455
Do you suppose Guy wiII Iike it?

950
00:51:33,533 --> 00:51:37,936
WiII Guy Iike a mascuIine organ?
I think that's a safe bet.

951
00:51:41,741 --> 00:51:44,574
Mr. Ornstein, um,

952
00:51:44,644 --> 00:51:49,081
after you've been married for a whiIe,
how do you, um...

953
00:51:49,149 --> 00:51:51,515
How do you keep it exciting?

954
00:51:54,621 --> 00:51:55,918
You don't.

955
00:51:56,956 --> 00:52:01,723
Oh, I couId never beIieve that,
not where there's Iove.

956
00:52:01,795 --> 00:52:03,228
But IateIy...

957
00:52:04,564 --> 00:52:07,294
weII, I hate to be bIunt, but...

958
00:52:08,368 --> 00:52:13,328
how do I get Guy
in the mood for...cIoseness?

959
00:52:17,977 --> 00:52:20,571
BeIieve me, SaI, it's not you.

960
00:52:23,783 --> 00:52:25,683
Oh, Iook at me go on and on.

961
00:52:25,752 --> 00:52:30,712
The simpIe fact is,
my Iife is a dream come true.

962
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:32,758
Hey, do you want to hear me pIay?

963
00:52:32,826 --> 00:52:36,455
- Not even a IittIe.
- Just to see what I remember.

964
00:53:02,389 --> 00:53:05,790
Two kinds of love

965
00:53:05,859 --> 00:53:10,762
We're in two kinds of love

966
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:15,563
l have feelings for you

967
00:53:15,635 --> 00:53:20,004
l'll spend all my days with you

968
00:53:22,409 --> 00:53:25,845
Two kinds of love

969
00:53:25,912 --> 00:53:30,406
We're in two kinds of love

970
00:53:31,217 --> 00:53:35,586
Even though now it seems

971
00:53:35,655 --> 00:53:41,025
You're feeling no love for me

972
00:53:41,094 --> 00:53:46,623
Still l hope deep inside you'll change

973
00:53:46,699 --> 00:53:51,864
And l still fantasize a way

974
00:53:51,938 --> 00:53:55,874
For us to go on

975
00:53:55,942 --> 00:54:00,311
ln spite of two kinds of love

976
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,999
You're never around

977
00:54:31,077 --> 00:54:34,774
You're nowhere to be found

978
00:54:36,816 --> 00:54:40,411
ls it something l said

979
00:54:40,487 --> 00:54:45,720
Or am l being misled

980
00:54:45,792 --> 00:54:51,424
Still l hope deep inside you'll change

981
00:54:51,498 --> 00:54:56,561
And l still fantasize a way

982
00:54:56,636 --> 00:55:00,367
For us to go on

983
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:05,104
ln spite of two kinds of love

984
00:55:07,313 --> 00:55:09,941
Two kinds of love

985
00:55:10,517 --> 00:55:14,681
Two kinds of love

986
00:55:16,856 --> 00:55:19,188
Oy vey, what did I eat?

987
00:55:22,428 --> 00:55:26,091
- Nice.
- Mr. Ornstein's on the...phone.

988
00:55:26,165 --> 00:55:27,757
WeII, when he gets off,

989
00:55:27,834 --> 00:55:31,201
why don't you teII him that Freddie Stevens
heard about his IittIe trade.

990
00:55:31,271 --> 00:55:33,637
And I'm not going to take it Iying down.

991
00:55:33,706 --> 00:55:37,665
You teII him, mess with Freddie Stevens,
and I'II bury him!

992
00:55:37,744 --> 00:55:41,475
''Freddie's not gonna to take it.''

993
00:55:41,548 --> 00:55:45,075
ActuaIIy, make that,
''Freddie Stevens stopped by.''

994
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:47,085
Okay. I'II Iet him know.

995
00:55:49,722 --> 00:55:52,316
So I guess you got...

996
00:55:53,426 --> 00:55:55,417
a pretty sweet setup here, huh?

997
00:55:55,929 --> 00:55:58,295
Nice cIothes, big house,

998
00:55:59,299 --> 00:56:01,267
your mug on aII the magazine covers.

999
00:56:01,334 --> 00:56:07,432
WeII, I Iike to think of myseIf as an ordinary wife
of an extraordinary husband.

1000
00:56:07,507 --> 00:56:09,304
Oh, Iike him.

1001
00:56:09,375 --> 00:56:12,173
Save it for the Iady reporters.

1002
00:56:12,245 --> 00:56:15,544
Whatever Stone's giving you,
I'II pay you doubIe.

1003
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:18,778
- UnIess it's reaIIy a Iot.
- Pay me?

1004
00:56:18,851 --> 00:56:21,183
- To go pubIic.
- You're confusing me.

1005
00:56:21,254 --> 00:56:23,814
Fine, just name your price.

1006
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:26,120
But be a mensch.
November was a bear.

1007
00:56:26,192 --> 00:56:28,626
I Iet Guy handIe our money.
Let's caII him.

1008
00:56:28,695 --> 00:56:31,926
You want to knock off
the innocent act, doII?

1009
00:56:31,998 --> 00:56:36,264
We both know your husband's
a big honking queer! And your marriage is...

1010
00:56:36,336 --> 00:56:38,770
Guy a homosexuaI? PIease.

1011
00:56:38,838 --> 00:56:42,535
He Iifts weights constantIy!
I'm going to go get him.

1012
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:46,602
- Don't teII me you're not in on it.
- In on what?

1013
00:56:47,614 --> 00:56:51,106
Sure. Why trust you
to sit on something Iike this?

1014
00:56:51,184 --> 00:56:53,084
There's nothing for me to sit on.

1015
00:56:53,152 --> 00:56:56,679
Of course there's not,
you're husband's a fairy.

1016
00:56:56,756 --> 00:56:58,621
Deep down inside you know it's true.

1017
00:56:58,691 --> 00:57:00,989
Or have your nyIons just been
stretching themseIves out?

1018
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:03,551
I don't know what you're taIking about.

1019
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:05,495
And...action.

1020
00:57:05,565 --> 00:57:09,899
How can they caII this a mine
when everything is theirs!

1021
00:57:22,348 --> 00:57:25,010
Guy a homosexual.

1022
00:57:45,004 --> 00:57:46,631
Okay...

1023
00:57:46,706 --> 00:57:51,234
that was the best sex
I have ever had in my Iife.

1024
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:53,210
Yeah, I get that a Iot.

1025
00:57:55,248 --> 00:57:56,875
Hey, save your strength.

1026
00:57:56,949 --> 00:58:01,249
We stiII haven't done it in the commissary,
the castIe tower and SauI's office.

1027
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,720
And ''BIood Mine'' wraps in three days.

1028
00:58:05,692 --> 00:58:07,387
Yeah, it does.

1029
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:10,327
I shouIdn't even have said that.
Come here.

1030
00:58:13,399 --> 00:58:17,460
And that's when I say,
keep your mitts off my gaI!

1031
00:58:17,537 --> 00:58:18,799
Hey, Jerry.

1032
00:58:18,871 --> 00:58:21,135
We were just rehearsing the fight scene.

1033
00:58:21,207 --> 00:58:25,075
Yes...the fight scene.

1034
00:58:25,144 --> 00:58:26,771
AbsoIuteIy.

1035
00:58:26,846 --> 00:58:28,143
Jerry...

1036
00:58:28,214 --> 00:58:31,274
Do you have any idea
how stupid this is?

1037
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:32,749
Right under her nose, too.

1038
00:58:32,819 --> 00:58:35,344
She's gone home.
Everyone has.

1039
00:58:38,725 --> 00:58:41,250
- Hola, Guy.
- Hector.

1040
00:58:45,965 --> 00:58:48,798
Okay, occasionaI sex
we can work around,

1041
00:58:48,868 --> 00:58:50,961
but seeing somebody
on a reguIar basis?

1042
00:58:51,037 --> 00:58:53,164
So you're saying
he can never faII in Iove?

1043
00:58:53,239 --> 00:58:55,400
- I don't make the ruIes.
- But you do.

1044
00:58:55,475 --> 00:58:59,536
We aII do...by the exampIe
that we set.

1045
00:58:59,612 --> 00:59:03,139
Okay, can I just say that's beautifuI?

1046
00:59:03,216 --> 00:59:04,877
And retarded!

1047
00:59:05,952 --> 00:59:09,786
Maybe 50 years from now
a gay actor wiII be no big deaI,

1048
00:59:09,856 --> 00:59:12,791
but I'm not about to sacrifice Guy
to some cause.

1049
00:59:15,328 --> 00:59:16,386
Rick. Jerry.

1050
00:59:16,462 --> 00:59:20,990
I hate it when the men in my Iife fight.
Besides, we both know you can work this out.

1051
00:59:21,067 --> 00:59:22,398
- Not...this time.
- This time?

1052
00:59:22,468 --> 00:59:23,935
It's different.

1053
00:59:27,173 --> 00:59:31,269
AII right.
I'II get him a writing job--

1054
00:59:31,344 --> 00:59:33,608
the next ''Captain Astro,'' whatever.

1055
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:37,809
Guy produces. You see each other
onIy at meetings

1056
00:59:37,884 --> 00:59:40,409
arranged through my office
so there's a paper traiI.

1057
00:59:40,486 --> 00:59:43,284
I'm supposed to make an appointment
to see my boyfriend?

1058
00:59:43,356 --> 00:59:46,154
Your boyfriend happens to be
a movie star.

1059
00:59:46,225 --> 00:59:48,455
Though for how much Ionger
is anyone's guess.

1060
00:59:51,831 --> 00:59:53,492
I don't want to know.

1061
00:59:56,903 --> 00:59:58,803
So, uh, where were we?

1062
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:02,667
Going over the fight scene.

1063
01:00:04,177 --> 01:00:08,136
Jerry can be a IittIe over-protective.

1064
01:00:08,214 --> 01:00:10,944
It's not just her, it's everything.

1065
01:00:11,017 --> 01:00:15,545
The Iying, the sneaking around,
and then there's SaIIy.

1066
01:00:15,621 --> 01:00:19,921
Did I teII you she found me a date
for her big premiere party?

1067
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:21,823
I feeI Iike the other woman.

1068
01:00:22,829 --> 01:00:26,560
I know things are a IittIe crazy right now,

1069
01:00:26,632 --> 01:00:28,827
but if you can just hoId out tiII spring.

1070
01:00:28,901 --> 01:00:32,268
- When you go to ItaIy?
- When we go to ItaIy.

1071
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:40,807
A seaside viIIa.
No SaIIy, no Jerry.

1072
01:00:43,216 --> 01:00:44,706
Just the two of us...

1073
01:00:45,718 --> 01:00:47,208
for a year.

1074
01:00:49,422 --> 01:00:52,186
- I don't know what to say.
- Say yes.

1075
01:00:53,392 --> 01:00:55,553
Now, where were we?

1076
01:01:06,505 --> 01:01:09,235
lt's S.R.O.

1077
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:46,605
The old vote was 1 1 yea, 1 6 nay.

1078
01:01:46,679 --> 01:01:49,546
But the new one
is five to two.

1079
01:01:49,615 --> 01:01:51,207
ln my favor.

1080
01:01:51,284 --> 01:01:55,414
Well, l guess l can't blame my boys
for wanting to join your labor club.

1081
01:01:55,488 --> 01:01:58,048
l sure let them down in West Tunnel.

1082
01:01:58,124 --> 01:02:01,787
Why? Why? Why?

1083
01:02:01,861 --> 01:02:07,458
You can make it up to them by signing
my five-year plan, l mean, contract.

1084
01:02:07,533 --> 01:02:10,900
- Don't do it, Mr. Fathermanl
- Flintl Thank God you're all rightl

1085
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:13,564
- Yes, most fortunate.
- No thanks to you, Redburg.

1086
01:02:13,639 --> 01:02:16,233
Recognize this? Huh?

1087
01:02:17,677 --> 01:02:19,645
What's your ''Russia''?

1088
01:02:21,147 --> 01:02:22,307
Well, Flint, have you learned your lesson?

1089
01:02:22,381 --> 01:02:27,148
l think we all have, sir. lf it ain't broke,
it was probably made in America.

1090
01:02:27,219 --> 01:02:29,153
The countess is a lucky woman.

1091
01:02:38,331 --> 01:02:39,525
Excuse me.

1092
01:02:39,598 --> 01:02:42,863
- Have you seen my husband?
- Yes, yes, I have.

1093
01:02:44,904 --> 01:02:46,166
Anything.

1094
01:02:50,609 --> 01:02:54,375
- Smart dress.
- Thank you. It's from a pattern.

1095
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:01,686
Victor, why did you hire
so many homosexuaI waiters?

1096
01:03:01,754 --> 01:03:03,813
Because that's the onIy kind.

1097
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:07,520
Victor.
Oh, there you are, siIIy.

1098
01:03:07,593 --> 01:03:12,121
It's going so weII. Judy and Sid GarIand-Luft
are here, and Mr. and Mrs. Liberace.

1099
01:03:12,198 --> 01:03:14,689
- That's great. Excuse me.
- Guy.

1100
01:03:14,767 --> 01:03:17,327
- Jesus.
- Oh, heIIo, Miss AIbrecht.

1101
01:03:17,403 --> 01:03:22,272
If a bomb went off in this pIace,
some of my cIients couId actuaIIy get work.

1102
01:03:23,809 --> 01:03:25,970
- Isn't Guy's movie wonderfuI?
- I Ioved it.

1103
01:03:26,045 --> 01:03:29,811
I know peopIe wiII think I'm just saying that
because I'm his manager...

1104
01:03:29,882 --> 01:03:31,042
and I have to.

1105
01:03:31,117 --> 01:03:34,678
- HeIIo, SaIIy.
- HeIIo, Mr. Ornstein.

1106
01:03:34,754 --> 01:03:38,884
- Bernice.
- HeIIo back, honey pie.

1107
01:03:38,958 --> 01:03:40,516
There's punch...

1108
01:03:44,864 --> 01:03:47,298
Thank you.
Excuse me.

1109
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:50,200
WeII, you must be so proud.

1110
01:03:50,269 --> 01:03:53,636
Your very first movie and starring me.

1111
01:03:53,706 --> 01:03:57,802
- It's a piece of crap.
- But starring me.

1112
01:03:57,877 --> 01:04:00,869
Doesn't it tear your guts
to see something Iike that?

1113
01:04:00,946 --> 01:04:04,074
I wrote that book to say something
and it's not ''America Works''!

1114
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:06,846
WeII, your book is stiII out there.
This wiII draw attention to it.

1115
01:04:06,919 --> 01:04:09,752
Thank you, Guy. I think I've bought into
enough of your stupid rationaIizations.

1116
01:04:09,822 --> 01:04:11,289
What do I have to show for it?

1117
01:04:11,357 --> 01:04:14,053
I got a beard date,
a fascist movie with my name on it,

1118
01:04:14,126 --> 01:04:16,492
and a boyfriend I can
onIy see at meetings.

1119
01:04:16,562 --> 01:04:17,722
I'm you.

1120
01:04:17,797 --> 01:04:19,890
- Guy.
- Rick.

1121
01:04:19,965 --> 01:04:21,762
Mr. Foster?

1122
01:04:23,669 --> 01:04:26,536
I'd Iike you to meet LoueIIa
from ''Redbook.''

1123
01:04:26,605 --> 01:04:28,732
SaIIy teIIs me you two
have separate rooms.

1124
01:04:28,808 --> 01:04:32,744
- McCarthy's Red hunt was a big hit.
- I can't just repeat him.

1125
01:04:32,812 --> 01:04:34,803
Uh, Ray, that's what we do here.

1126
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,542
We seII the oId stew
in a bright, new can.

1127
01:04:37,616 --> 01:04:40,050
That's what I'm saying.
I need a new can.

1128
01:04:40,119 --> 01:04:41,347
I'II say.

1129
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:44,116
The Soviets tried fiIm propaganda.

1130
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:48,058
Vertov, Eisenstein.
It was a faiIure there.

1131
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:52,894
Okay, this conversation
is about show business? But not enough.

1132
01:04:52,965 --> 01:04:54,762
Guy, thank God.

1133
01:04:54,834 --> 01:04:58,497
First his fiIm and then him.
I need a IittIe pick-me-up.

1134
01:04:58,571 --> 01:05:00,334
Which one of these is Judy's?

1135
01:05:00,406 --> 01:05:01,634
Have you seen Rick?

1136
01:05:01,707 --> 01:05:04,574
This is not the time or pIace.
You're working.

1137
01:05:04,643 --> 01:05:06,440
- Bingo.
- Victor.

1138
01:05:06,512 --> 01:05:08,207
- He's upstairs.
- Thank you.

1139
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,544
- Bitch!
- Scotch.

1140
01:05:13,252 --> 01:05:14,981
Hit me again.

1141
01:05:15,054 --> 01:05:16,316
SauI.

1142
01:05:16,388 --> 01:05:20,654
- Great party, huh?
- Yeah. Why don't you join it?

1143
01:05:20,726 --> 01:05:23,217
Oh, uh, about that--

1144
01:05:23,295 --> 01:05:27,129
I heard about the whoIe
you-giving-me-up thing?

1145
01:05:27,199 --> 01:05:30,828
And it's onIy fair to warn you,
we ItaIians don't sing.

1146
01:05:30,903 --> 01:05:33,701
You're ItaIian Iike the Pope's a Jew.

1147
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:37,768
''Gay'' Stone, on the other hand, weII--

1148
01:05:37,843 --> 01:05:40,641
He'II beIt you out a show tune of names.

1149
01:05:40,713 --> 01:05:43,079
Look, Freddie, I Iike you.

1150
01:05:43,149 --> 01:05:45,549
WeII, that's not true,
but this isn't personaI.

1151
01:05:45,618 --> 01:05:49,850
Guy makes more money for me.
I gotta to cover my ass.

1152
01:05:49,922 --> 01:05:52,584
Yeah, weII, with him around, we aII do.

1153
01:05:57,696 --> 01:05:59,527
Thank you.
Excuse me.

1154
01:06:11,310 --> 01:06:15,906
I couId actuaIIy use one of SauI's memos
right about now.

1155
01:06:15,981 --> 01:06:18,848
Because I Iove being a movie star.

1156
01:06:19,852 --> 01:06:21,683
And I Iove you.

1157
01:06:23,289 --> 01:06:26,383
And I reaIIy need for this
to have a happy ending.

1158
01:06:26,458 --> 01:06:29,723
SauI wouId say the hero has to sacrifice
everything for the countess.

1159
01:06:29,795 --> 01:06:33,287
I am three weeks from ''Ben Hur.''
And then we're in ItaIy and--

1160
01:06:33,365 --> 01:06:36,232
SaIIy is going with you to ItaIy, Guy.
We both know that.

1161
01:06:36,302 --> 01:06:38,327
WeII, what do you want me to do?
Give up movies?

1162
01:06:38,404 --> 01:06:40,099
I wouId.

1163
01:06:41,507 --> 01:06:42,496
You'd give up writing?

1164
01:06:42,575 --> 01:06:47,808
If being a writer meant hiding who I was to coddIe
the bigotries of peopIe who hated me?

1165
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:49,438
In a second.

1166
01:06:51,984 --> 01:06:54,214
Then I guess we're different.

1167
01:06:55,754 --> 01:06:56,743
Guess so.

1168
01:06:56,822 --> 01:06:59,655
But we knew that going in.

1169
01:07:01,293 --> 01:07:03,090
Rick.

1170
01:07:03,162 --> 01:07:05,426
It's one bad movie.

1171
01:07:05,497 --> 01:07:09,490
- Don't make this into one of your things.
- I'm not.

1172
01:07:09,568 --> 01:07:11,365
This isn't courage, Guy.

1173
01:07:11,437 --> 01:07:16,136
I couId sign off on aII of it
and there wouId stiII come a point.

1174
01:07:16,208 --> 01:07:19,234
And I don't understand,
because I'm reaI.

1175
01:07:33,259 --> 01:07:34,749
I'II divorce SaIIy.

1176
01:07:34,827 --> 01:07:36,954
This party is as dead as James Dean.

1177
01:07:37,029 --> 01:07:39,589
It wouIdn't be if someone
wouId just pIay that organ.

1178
01:07:39,665 --> 01:07:42,133
Everyone is having a bIast.

1179
01:07:42,201 --> 01:07:46,365
I think someone's had too many bIasts.

1180
01:07:46,438 --> 01:07:51,068
At the office, do you spend
a Iot of time staring at my rack?

1181
01:07:52,311 --> 01:07:55,610
- It wouId destroy her.
- At first.

1182
01:07:55,681 --> 01:07:57,774
In the end it wouId be a kindness.

1183
01:08:01,687 --> 01:08:03,587
But you'd stiII be a movie star.

1184
01:08:05,424 --> 01:08:09,656
I don't have it aII worked out yet,
and I get the contradictions.

1185
01:08:10,629 --> 01:08:15,430
But if you couId pick the one thing that you hated
most about our movie of your book,

1186
01:08:15,501 --> 01:08:17,332
what wouId it be?

1187
01:08:20,306 --> 01:08:22,399
It makes everything too simpIe.

1188
01:08:25,177 --> 01:08:29,273
The purpIe button is trombones.
It's fun. Try it. Guy? Oh.

1189
01:08:33,719 --> 01:08:35,277
It's very expensive.

1190
01:08:35,354 --> 01:08:37,584
It gives me nightmares.
Excuse me.

1191
01:08:40,826 --> 01:08:42,418
Guy?

1192
01:08:49,668 --> 01:08:51,192
Guy?

1193
01:08:51,270 --> 01:08:53,238
Not quite.

1194
01:08:53,305 --> 01:08:56,706
Mr. Stevens, I'm fairIy certain
that's iIIegaI.

1195
01:08:56,775 --> 01:08:59,573
- Who am I hurting?
- My hair!

1196
01:08:59,645 --> 01:09:02,341
After aII, apparentIy my career is over.

1197
01:09:04,416 --> 01:09:06,179
It's not fair.

1198
01:09:06,352 --> 01:09:08,547
I did everything right.

1199
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:11,453
Tanned, tore out my reaI teeth.

1200
01:09:11,523 --> 01:09:13,457
I even Iearned to act.

1201
01:09:16,328 --> 01:09:19,559
What does Guy Stone have that I don't?

1202
01:09:19,631 --> 01:09:24,193
WeII, maybe if you tried
to be a nicer person,

1203
01:09:24,269 --> 01:09:27,466
the audience wouId sense that

1204
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:29,131
and then wouId respond.

1205
01:09:30,342 --> 01:09:32,401
He has you.

1206
01:09:32,478 --> 01:09:33,945
Yes, he does.

1207
01:09:34,012 --> 01:09:36,742
And aII the great press you get.

1208
01:09:36,815 --> 01:09:40,046
But...what does he give you back, huh?

1209
01:09:40,119 --> 01:09:43,555
A heart fuII of happy.
Thank you very much.

1210
01:09:43,622 --> 01:09:46,819
I couId fiII a Iot more than
your heart with happy.

1211
01:09:46,892 --> 01:09:48,621
Ewwww...

1212
01:09:50,462 --> 01:09:51,793
Leave Stone...

1213
01:09:52,765 --> 01:09:54,232
and marry me.

1214
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:57,700
You're...just...high.

1215
01:09:59,037 --> 01:10:01,301
It's a crime what he's doing.

1216
01:10:02,374 --> 01:10:06,674
A juicy peach Iike you
shouIdn't rot in the bowI.

1217
01:10:08,113 --> 01:10:09,637
Ewwww...

1218
01:10:16,155 --> 01:10:17,918
I'm married!

1219
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:20,117
You communist!

1220
01:10:20,192 --> 01:10:23,923
- So, you changed your mind?
- I'II check on the punch.

1221
01:10:23,996 --> 01:10:26,362
Thursday's two-for-one night.

1222
01:10:33,205 --> 01:10:34,263
That too hard?

1223
01:10:34,339 --> 01:10:35,465
-Guy?
- SaIIy.

1224
01:10:35,541 --> 01:10:39,671
And then I say,
''Keep your mitts off my gaI.''

1225
01:10:39,745 --> 01:10:42,612
Ahhhh!

1226
01:10:45,050 --> 01:10:45,778
Mwahhh!

1227
01:10:45,851 --> 01:10:47,443
Ow! God!

1228
01:10:48,954 --> 01:10:50,819
- I got them!
- What the heII is...

1229
01:10:50,889 --> 01:10:52,117
Oy.

1230
01:10:54,393 --> 01:10:58,261
- Okay, here's why this is good....
- Excuse me.

1231
01:11:00,632 --> 01:11:03,931
You'll never work in this town
if all your stories get out

1232
01:11:04,002 --> 01:11:05,333
Keep it under your hat

1233
01:11:05,404 --> 01:11:09,340
There's only one thing people
will never live without

1234
01:11:09,408 --> 01:11:11,672
They love to watch the mighty fall

1235
01:11:11,743 --> 01:11:14,541
And make somebody big seem small

1236
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:16,910
All might seem hunky-dory today

1237
01:11:18,984 --> 01:11:21,418
Pictures can be doctored,

1238
01:11:21,487 --> 01:11:23,045
witnesses bought.

1239
01:11:23,989 --> 01:11:26,048
Maybe you were drunk.

1240
01:11:26,124 --> 01:11:27,751
HeIIo?

1241
01:11:28,827 --> 01:11:30,158
- Bitch.
- Hag.

1242
01:11:30,229 --> 01:11:32,925
- Where have you been?
- Reporters.

1243
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:37,027
I'm going to go outside
and have a smoke.

1244
01:11:38,237 --> 01:11:40,068
Hi, SauI.

1245
01:11:44,376 --> 01:11:45,434
God damn it!

1246
01:11:45,511 --> 01:11:48,708
He voided your contract,
per the moraIs cIause.

1247
01:11:50,282 --> 01:11:53,843
I hate to badmouth another star,
even a beat-red, chiId-pawing fruit.

1248
01:11:53,919 --> 01:11:58,788
And guess which big star
he fingered for this new pink hunt?

1249
01:11:59,892 --> 01:12:02,122
As the new Ben Hur,
I feeI strongIy...

1250
01:12:03,262 --> 01:12:04,957
When did this business get so mean?

1251
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:07,260
When they started it.

1252
01:12:07,332 --> 01:12:08,924
Maybe it's for the best.

1253
01:12:09,001 --> 01:12:10,696
I mean,

1254
01:12:10,769 --> 01:12:13,670
I was kind of participating
in my own oppression.

1255
01:12:13,739 --> 01:12:15,206
Huh?

1256
01:12:18,577 --> 01:12:20,670
Anyway, I have money.

1257
01:12:25,284 --> 01:12:27,878
I have Iots of money.
You saw how I Iived.

1258
01:12:27,953 --> 01:12:31,320
ExactIy. There's the house.
SaIIy gets that.

1259
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:34,723
Forget about any other studios
or teIevision.

1260
01:12:38,697 --> 01:12:40,460
You'II think of something.

1261
01:12:43,135 --> 01:12:44,693
- Not...
- This time.

1262
01:12:46,138 --> 01:12:47,196
This time.

1263
01:12:47,272 --> 01:12:48,569
It's different.

1264
01:12:51,843 --> 01:12:52,901
It is.

1265
01:12:56,715 --> 01:12:58,376
Yeah, I know.

1266
01:13:01,286 --> 01:13:02,844
Good night, TheIma.

1267
01:13:04,856 --> 01:13:07,416
You don't have to wait for me
every night.

1268
01:13:07,492 --> 01:13:09,858
What eIse do I have to do?

1269
01:13:10,762 --> 01:13:12,593
Don't worry, it's not steak.

1270
01:13:12,664 --> 01:13:14,928
It's chicken and a can of peas.

1271
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,400
- And two bottIes of swiII beer.
- I'm impressed.

1272
01:13:17,469 --> 01:13:20,802
Oh, Iook, Iook.
It's the movie queen.

1273
01:13:20,872 --> 01:13:22,134
- Hey, Guy ''Fag.''

1274
01:13:22,207 --> 01:13:24,937
- You want to suck on this?
- Okay, how hard is ''Gay'' Stone?

1275
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:27,308
- What'd you just say?
- You want to suck on this?

1276
01:13:27,379 --> 01:13:29,939
- Make your move, paI!
- Come on, postaI boy!

1277
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:34,211
I'm such an idiot.

1278
01:13:34,286 --> 01:13:36,447
Just forget about those guys.

1279
01:13:36,521 --> 01:13:39,149
It's not just them.

1280
01:13:39,224 --> 01:13:42,489
I actuaIIy thought
peopIe were okay with us.

1281
01:13:42,561 --> 01:13:45,530
Maybe not HoIIywood, but here?

1282
01:13:45,597 --> 01:13:48,157
I waIk around.
Lots of guys do.

1283
01:13:48,233 --> 01:13:52,761
It never occurred to me that,
on us, they just can't see it.

1284
01:13:52,838 --> 01:13:55,932
What are you taIking about?
Look at you.

1285
01:14:00,045 --> 01:14:01,842
Is it them?

1286
01:14:05,651 --> 01:14:07,949
- Guy, I don't think you shouId...
- Who is it?

1287
01:14:09,655 --> 01:14:11,213
I'm not in the mood.

1288
01:14:11,289 --> 01:14:13,723
I've been trying to find this pIace
for an hour.

1289
01:14:13,792 --> 01:14:15,282
You've never been to SiIverIake?

1290
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:19,353
If I want to be around a bunch of men
who have no interest in me,

1291
01:14:19,431 --> 01:14:21,160
I couId go anywhere.

1292
01:14:21,667 --> 01:14:23,464
So how you doin'?

1293
01:14:24,569 --> 01:14:27,697
- Did he just ask me how I'm doing?
- Yeah, I think so.

1294
01:14:27,773 --> 01:14:31,038
- Oh, I need to sit down.
- Rick's writing me a pIay.

1295
01:14:31,109 --> 01:14:32,041
Oh, goody.

1296
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:34,271
Of course, the reaI money is in poems.

1297
01:14:34,346 --> 01:14:36,678
Hey, I can use that.
It's about HoIIywood.

1298
01:14:36,748 --> 01:14:38,511
You come down pro or con?

1299
01:14:38,583 --> 01:14:40,141
We're going to put it up ourseIves.

1300
01:14:40,218 --> 01:14:42,846
In a tiny theater.
I know how broke I am.

1301
01:14:42,921 --> 01:14:45,048
WeII, maybe not
after the inquiry on Friday.

1302
01:14:45,123 --> 01:14:46,852
I didn't know they paid you
for those things

1303
01:14:46,925 --> 01:14:49,120
They don't.

1304
01:14:49,194 --> 01:14:52,823
But SauI, he didn't just hand you over
to Mr. Verrine.

1305
01:14:52,898 --> 01:14:56,356
- He promised you'd sing.
- Why wouId I do that? My career's over aIready.

1306
01:14:56,435 --> 01:14:59,871
Which SauI finaIIy figured out today
and came to see me.

1307
01:14:59,938 --> 01:15:01,530
SauI came to you?

1308
01:15:02,874 --> 01:15:04,637
I got your contract reinstated

1309
01:15:04,710 --> 01:15:08,441
and a massive pubIicity campaign

1310
01:15:08,513 --> 01:15:11,971
that portrays your exposure
as a hoax.

1311
01:15:13,652 --> 01:15:16,120
I'd aIways heard of totaI Ieverage before,

1312
01:15:16,188 --> 01:15:19,680
but the taste of it, it's Iike, uh...

1313
01:15:19,758 --> 01:15:21,726
GirI-on-girI sex?

1314
01:15:21,793 --> 01:15:26,059
- I am not a Iesbian!
- WeII, I guess at your age it's mostIy a titIe.

1315
01:15:27,466 --> 01:15:31,596
You stop cracking wise
or I won't teII you who Ben Hur is again.

1316
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:33,899
Oh!

1317
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:35,872
Oh!

1318
01:15:35,941 --> 01:15:37,533
I get to be Ben Hur!

1319
01:15:37,609 --> 01:15:39,634
I get to be--

1320
01:15:39,711 --> 01:15:42,612
- But he'd have to sing.
- Yes. He'II have to sing.

1321
01:15:46,218 --> 01:15:48,118
WeII, uh, I couIdn't do that anyway.

1322
01:15:48,186 --> 01:15:50,552
- I don't know any gay com--
- You know one.

1323
01:15:51,656 --> 01:15:53,089
You are unbeIievabIe.

1324
01:15:53,158 --> 01:15:54,716
You've sworn off HoIIywood anyway.

1325
01:15:54,793 --> 01:15:58,320
The whoIe reason they'd want him
to name names is because it sends a signaI.

1326
01:15:58,396 --> 01:16:00,796
HoIIywood has a kind of mob mentaIity.
Maybe you've noticed.

1327
01:16:00,866 --> 01:16:04,529
Oh, pIease, why don't you teII me
aII about HoIIywood?

1328
01:16:04,603 --> 01:16:06,833
WouId you pIease teII her she's crazy?

1329
01:16:21,453 --> 01:16:24,149
You know what it means
to be a movie star?

1330
01:16:24,222 --> 01:16:26,884
lt means being 34.

1331
01:16:27,893 --> 01:16:29,622
Thirty-four?

1332
01:16:42,574 --> 01:16:46,135
I'm sure Ms. Hepburn
was just teIIing us to go to heII.

1333
01:16:46,211 --> 01:16:49,009
And to your Ieft, the pervert paIace

1334
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:52,311
of America's swishiest bacheIor,

1335
01:16:52,384 --> 01:16:53,976
movie star Guy Stone.

1336
01:16:54,052 --> 01:16:56,111
This is me.

1337
01:16:57,122 --> 01:16:58,384
Excuse me.

1338
01:17:05,297 --> 01:17:06,559
Guy?

1339
01:17:09,601 --> 01:17:12,035
I thought you'd be at work.

1340
01:17:12,103 --> 01:17:14,094
I know. I shouId be.

1341
01:17:14,172 --> 01:17:17,300
But IateIy...it's the most pecuIiar thing.

1342
01:17:17,375 --> 01:17:19,138
It'II be time to get up

1343
01:17:19,211 --> 01:17:21,975
and I just stay right there in bed.

1344
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:23,844
It's caIIed depression.

1345
01:17:23,915 --> 01:17:27,043
It's caIIed ''Iazy'' where I come from.

1346
01:17:27,118 --> 01:17:31,384
I use vodka instead of water now.
Adds a reaI zing, don't you think?

1347
01:17:32,591 --> 01:17:35,059
You know what?
Let's just have coffee instead.

1348
01:17:35,126 --> 01:17:37,560
I put scotch in that.
Excuse me.

1349
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:58,316
Stop being so good.
l hate your goodness.

1350
01:17:58,383 --> 01:18:01,011
Sarah, you could never hate me
more than l love you.

1351
01:18:01,086 --> 01:18:02,553
l don't hate you.

1352
01:18:02,621 --> 01:18:06,022
l love you and l hate myself for it.

1353
01:18:06,091 --> 01:18:07,353
Never hate love.

1354
01:18:07,425 --> 01:18:11,225
You're a lover and lovers love love .

1355
01:18:11,296 --> 01:18:12,388
Are you okay?

1356
01:18:12,464 --> 01:18:15,956
I do that four or five times a week.
It's nothing.

1357
01:18:16,034 --> 01:18:18,559
Freddie caIIs me his dumb Iush.

1358
01:18:19,404 --> 01:18:20,996
Freddie?

1359
01:18:21,072 --> 01:18:22,972
He Iives here now.

1360
01:18:25,243 --> 01:18:27,268
Do you Iove him?

1361
01:18:29,414 --> 01:18:31,041
Love is just

1362
01:18:31,116 --> 01:18:34,950
a big heart-shaped box fuII
of chocoIate-covered razor bIades.

1363
01:18:35,887 --> 01:18:36,854
Anyway...

1364
01:18:36,922 --> 01:18:39,447
maybe aII I reaIIy wanted

1365
01:18:39,524 --> 01:18:42,618
was to be a movie star's wife.

1366
01:18:42,694 --> 01:18:46,562
I mean, everybody says
I'm so good at it.

1367
01:18:46,631 --> 01:18:50,089
Maybe you were so good at it
because it's acting.

1368
01:18:52,237 --> 01:18:54,671
We aII know what peopIe think
of actresses.

1369
01:18:54,739 --> 01:18:57,367
You're taIking to one, remember?

1370
01:19:04,983 --> 01:19:05,972
Listen...

1371
01:19:08,186 --> 01:19:10,654
about this whoIe thing--

1372
01:19:10,722 --> 01:19:13,691
the Iying and the Ieading you on...

1373
01:19:13,758 --> 01:19:17,785
Mr. Ornstein and Miss AIbrecht
made you.

1374
01:19:17,862 --> 01:19:19,625
I couId have said no.

1375
01:19:21,299 --> 01:19:23,199
I shouId have said no.

1376
01:19:25,370 --> 01:19:26,803
I'm sorry.

1377
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:36,002
Those two-- you shouId have heard them
going at it yesterday

1378
01:19:36,081 --> 01:19:37,912
about your deaI.

1379
01:19:39,250 --> 01:19:41,480
- Right.
- Guy.

1380
01:19:43,421 --> 01:19:48,290
If you came here to see if I wouId be
your pretend wife again...

1381
01:19:53,231 --> 01:19:54,664
Yes.

1382
01:20:17,889 --> 01:20:20,449
So...l'll see you after work.

1383
01:20:28,767 --> 01:20:30,200
Crap.

1384
01:20:32,037 --> 01:20:34,403
HoId your horses.
I'm coming.

1385
01:20:39,711 --> 01:20:41,201
Oh, mother--

1386
01:20:43,915 --> 01:20:45,473
Not recentIy, no.

1387
01:20:46,384 --> 01:20:48,716
Haven't seen him,
but do you want a date?

1388
01:20:48,787 --> 01:20:50,721
What are you doing?

1389
01:20:52,157 --> 01:20:54,648
- How about you?
- Not since you came aIong.

1390
01:21:00,932 --> 01:21:02,194
WeII, Iook, who--

1391
01:21:03,468 --> 01:21:05,527
I don't want any troubIe.

1392
01:21:11,309 --> 01:21:13,800
- Stone residence.
- Sir, you're needed.

1393
01:21:15,647 --> 01:21:18,241
Came to check on you.

1394
01:21:18,316 --> 01:21:20,409
He'd made it to the door.

1395
01:21:20,485 --> 01:21:22,419
You're aII right.

1396
01:21:25,824 --> 01:21:26,916
I'm tired.

1397
01:21:26,991 --> 01:21:29,459
The doctor said someone's
not meant to speak.

1398
01:21:30,595 --> 01:21:33,564
- Guy...
- Your funeraI.

1399
01:21:33,631 --> 01:21:35,792
When you testify tomorrow...

1400
01:21:35,867 --> 01:21:37,357
name me.

1401
01:21:39,838 --> 01:21:42,238
No, no, Rick.

1402
01:21:42,307 --> 01:21:43,831
I want you to.

1403
01:21:43,908 --> 01:21:45,341
But you, but...

1404
01:21:45,410 --> 01:21:47,207
- It sends a signaI.
- To who?

1405
01:21:47,278 --> 01:21:50,736
SauI is right.
PeopIe are as stupid as him.

1406
01:21:52,383 --> 01:21:55,819
They just don't know any better.

1407
01:21:55,887 --> 01:21:57,115
That's aII.

1408
01:21:58,223 --> 01:21:59,781
You can change them.

1409
01:21:59,858 --> 01:22:02,418
What? With art?

1410
01:22:02,494 --> 01:22:04,826
And our actions.

1411
01:22:13,705 --> 01:22:15,138
You changed me.

1412
01:22:15,206 --> 01:22:17,470
It couId have been you,

1413
01:22:17,542 --> 01:22:19,066
easier than me.

1414
01:22:20,445 --> 01:22:23,972
- AII I know is that I Iove you.
- Get your oId Iife back.

1415
01:22:24,048 --> 01:22:25,811
Shh.

1416
01:22:27,352 --> 01:22:29,183
I'II be fine.

1417
01:22:30,855 --> 01:22:34,154
I might even...
get married.

1418
01:22:36,594 --> 01:22:38,289
Shut up.

1419
01:22:48,406 --> 01:22:52,069
We aIways keep a courtroom
on mothbaIIs, use it a Iot.

1420
01:22:52,143 --> 01:22:54,304
Got a poIice station too,
if you need it.

1421
01:22:54,379 --> 01:22:55,277
Background.

1422
01:22:55,346 --> 01:23:00,079
This over here is caIIed
a teIevision camera.

1423
01:23:00,151 --> 01:23:04,485
- Where the heII is Stone?
- He'II be here. ReIax.

1424
01:23:04,556 --> 01:23:08,424
And try to Iook Iike peopIe who aren't
a bunch of haIf-crazy Iosers

1425
01:23:08,493 --> 01:23:10,085
who are wasting their Iives.

1426
01:23:10,161 --> 01:23:14,097
- Where's Stone?
- I'm his fag-hag, not his mother.

1427
01:23:14,165 --> 01:23:15,655
Over here!

1428
01:23:24,042 --> 01:23:26,135
Yeah, we're not doing
the space movie today.

1429
01:23:26,211 --> 01:23:28,475
It reads as fIesh tone on TV.

1430
01:23:28,546 --> 01:23:31,413
There he is!
90 seconds.

1431
01:23:31,482 --> 01:23:34,315
To the nadir of my
once-promising career...

1432
01:23:34,385 --> 01:23:35,317
Nadir.

1433
01:23:35,386 --> 01:23:37,183
Hi, Guy.

1434
01:23:38,156 --> 01:23:40,784
Victor toId me about Rick.

1435
01:23:40,858 --> 01:23:42,086
He's fine.

1436
01:23:43,094 --> 01:23:46,860
If you name him,
we both know I'II think of something.

1437
01:23:46,931 --> 01:23:49,832
He's moving to BaItimore.
Might even get married.

1438
01:23:49,901 --> 01:23:53,166
Guy, I Iove you too.

1439
01:23:53,238 --> 01:23:56,833
And you wouIdn't survive
10 minutes out there aIone.

1440
01:24:04,182 --> 01:24:06,673
Every Iife buiIds toward,

1441
01:24:06,751 --> 01:24:09,015
and then radiates from,

1442
01:24:09,087 --> 01:24:11,146
a singIe moment.

1443
01:24:11,222 --> 01:24:13,281
Thank you, Jay.

1444
01:24:13,358 --> 01:24:16,589
Today l, S.R.O. Pictures

1445
01:24:16,661 --> 01:24:18,026
and Hit Parade cigarettes

1446
01:24:18,096 --> 01:24:21,429
mean to get to the bottom
of an issue far more serious

1447
01:24:21,499 --> 01:24:23,592
than ordinary communists--

1448
01:24:23,668 --> 01:24:25,727
Homosexual communists

1449
01:24:25,803 --> 01:24:27,498
working in Hollywood.

1450
01:24:27,572 --> 01:24:29,506
l don't mean directors

1451
01:24:29,574 --> 01:24:31,769
or behind-the-scenes nobodies, either.

1452
01:24:31,843 --> 01:24:35,335
I mean great big stars.

1453
01:24:35,413 --> 01:24:38,439
Toward that end I caII on Mr. Guy Stone.

1454
01:24:39,984 --> 01:24:41,542
Mr. Stone,

1455
01:24:41,619 --> 01:24:44,417
are you now or have you ever been

1456
01:24:44,489 --> 01:24:46,616
a homosexuaI communist?

1457
01:24:50,695 --> 01:24:51,992
Baltimore.

1458
01:24:53,031 --> 01:24:54,521
Los AngeIes.

1459
01:24:56,234 --> 01:24:58,293
Are you or have you, Mr. Stone?

1460
01:25:00,171 --> 01:25:01,160
Yes.

1461
01:25:04,375 --> 01:25:06,900
- And are you personally aware of others...
- Whatever's cheapest.

1462
01:25:06,978 --> 01:25:10,573
Iike yourseIf,
working in the motion picture industry?

1463
01:25:10,648 --> 01:25:12,775
Yes, I am.

1464
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:16,445
- PIease, state their names for the record.
- Better yet, sing 'em.

1465
01:25:17,422 --> 01:25:20,653
I am what you say,
and so are many of my peers.

1466
01:25:20,725 --> 01:25:21,953
So what?

1467
01:25:22,026 --> 01:25:24,688
I just need their names, Mr. Stone.

1468
01:25:24,762 --> 01:25:27,788
This is the only way
l can help you, Ray.

1469
01:25:27,865 --> 01:25:32,461
Because movies, for all their cornball,
reactionary idiocy,

1470
01:25:32,537 --> 01:25:34,664
show us life as it might be,

1471
01:25:34,739 --> 01:25:37,003
if onIy we couId Iive up to our ideaIs.

1472
01:25:37,909 --> 01:25:42,278
Movie characters are honest,
and IoyaI, and brave.

1473
01:25:42,347 --> 01:25:45,839
They sacrifice themseIves
for those they Iove.

1474
01:25:45,917 --> 01:25:49,148
They are proud of the quaIities
that make them individuaIs.

1475
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:51,654
They stand up for what's right,

1476
01:25:51,723 --> 01:25:54,487
no matter the odds, or consequences.

1477
01:25:54,559 --> 01:25:57,995
Movie characters, in short,

1478
01:25:58,062 --> 01:26:00,792
would not care who plays them.

1479
01:26:04,068 --> 01:26:08,664
But I guess there's a reason we pay money
to see peopIe Iike that.

1480
01:26:14,245 --> 01:26:17,874
In a way I wish I couId give you
10 miIIion names today,

1481
01:26:17,949 --> 01:26:20,975
because then 10 miIIion peopIe
couId stop hiding

1482
01:26:21,052 --> 01:26:23,748
and Iiving in fear.

1483
01:26:23,821 --> 01:26:26,654
And the rest of you
wouId discover wonderfuI, new sides

1484
01:26:26,724 --> 01:26:28,954
to peopIe you thought you knew.

1485
01:26:30,695 --> 01:26:32,993
But I can't do that, Mr. Verrine.

1486
01:26:34,899 --> 01:26:39,359
Because the main trait
that separates my kind from yours

1487
01:26:41,139 --> 01:26:43,630
is that we mean you no harm.

1488
01:26:47,111 --> 01:26:49,579
When you can say the same
about yourseIf...

1489
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:55,251
you wiII have earned the priviIege
of knowing our names.

1490
01:27:03,294 --> 01:27:05,524
Strike that propaganda from the record.

1491
01:27:05,596 --> 01:27:08,156
It's just a prop.

1492
01:27:08,232 --> 01:27:11,360
Mr. Stone, you are in contempt.

1493
01:27:11,436 --> 01:27:13,996
And it wiII be my recommendation
that you be sentenced

1494
01:27:14,071 --> 01:27:16,096
to 18 months in a correctionaI faciIity--

1495
01:27:16,174 --> 01:27:17,766
I'm a communist!

1496
01:27:20,511 --> 01:27:22,604
Peas and carrots!
Peas and carrots!

1497
01:27:25,216 --> 01:27:27,616
They add the sound in Iater.

1498
01:27:27,685 --> 01:27:30,620
- Excuse me?
- I'm a communist!

1499
01:27:31,856 --> 01:27:34,654
And did Mr. Stone indoctrinate you
into the party?

1500
01:27:34,725 --> 01:27:36,215
Uh, no, no, uh...

1501
01:27:37,995 --> 01:27:39,121
Just the opposite.

1502
01:27:39,197 --> 01:27:43,395
See, I am a member
of a super-secret cIub

1503
01:27:43,468 --> 01:27:47,063
that turns big HoIIywood stars
into Communists.

1504
01:27:47,138 --> 01:27:49,163
We were doing reaI good, too,

1505
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:51,834
but then Guy Stone got wind of us.

1506
01:27:51,909 --> 01:27:53,467
He posed as our comrade

1507
01:27:53,544 --> 01:27:57,378
then started taking us out
from the inside, one by one.

1508
01:27:57,448 --> 01:28:00,178
FinaIIy, there were just two of us Ieft.

1509
01:28:00,251 --> 01:28:02,811
But then my commander
came up with a pIan.

1510
01:28:02,887 --> 01:28:05,822
He had me trick Guy
into faIIing in Iove with me,

1511
01:28:05,890 --> 01:28:09,883
and when he married me,
I exposed him as a gay.

1512
01:28:09,961 --> 01:28:13,522
- Mr. Stone, is she teIIing the truth?
- No. It's from one of my movies.

1513
01:28:13,598 --> 01:28:14,496
See?

1514
01:28:14,565 --> 01:28:19,059
He'd rather have you beIieve
he's a gay communist than hurt me.

1515
01:28:19,136 --> 01:28:23,436
So I guess my pIan worked perfectIy,
except for one hitch.

1516
01:28:25,943 --> 01:28:28,275
I feII in Iove right back.

1517
01:28:31,582 --> 01:28:35,518
And through him I Iearned
that communism is wrong!

1518
01:28:35,586 --> 01:28:38,316
As wrong as peas in JeII-O!

1519
01:28:40,224 --> 01:28:43,387
- What is the name of your commander?
- The name of my commander is

1520
01:28:43,461 --> 01:28:44,655
Freddie Stevens.

1521
01:28:44,729 --> 01:28:46,629
What? You IittIe--

1522
01:28:47,732 --> 01:28:49,393
SauI!

1523
01:28:49,467 --> 01:28:52,459
Ray, she's just a dizzy broad!

1524
01:28:55,873 --> 01:28:57,363
What the heII.

1525
01:29:05,116 --> 01:29:07,311
Mrs. Stone...

1526
01:29:07,385 --> 01:29:10,616
thank you very much for your dramatic
and headIine-grabbing confession.

1527
01:29:10,688 --> 01:29:12,588
You are a good American.

1528
01:29:12,657 --> 01:29:17,560
We'll be right back after this word from smooth
and delicious Hit Parade cigarettes.

1529
01:29:22,833 --> 01:29:24,061
We're through!

1530
01:29:24,135 --> 01:29:27,229
When I say ''we,''
I mean me and Iife.

1531
01:29:28,372 --> 01:29:32,274
- CouId I have your autograph?
- SaIIy, you are something speciaI!

1532
01:29:32,343 --> 01:29:34,311
- You aIways have been.
- Thank you.

1533
01:29:34,378 --> 01:29:37,006
- I've never done this before.
- It's for me, Bess.

1534
01:29:37,081 --> 01:29:38,844
And I Iove you.

1535
01:29:38,983 --> 01:29:40,917
- Ew.
- That's what I thought.

1536
01:29:40,985 --> 01:29:43,818
But how wouId you Iike to be Astro GirI?

1537
01:29:50,127 --> 01:29:51,754
PIay goIf?

1538
01:29:52,730 --> 01:29:54,595
Love it.

1539
01:29:57,268 --> 01:29:58,530
FinaIIy.

1540
01:29:59,537 --> 01:30:01,767
A girI can have friends.

1541
01:30:02,907 --> 01:30:06,104
You were very impressive today.
You're Iike a whoIe new person.

1542
01:30:06,177 --> 01:30:08,543
HoId onto this for me, wouId you?
It's ugIy.

1543
01:30:08,613 --> 01:30:09,545
Where's Victor?

1544
01:30:09,614 --> 01:30:12,082
I kissed her mother,
but the daughter was a babe,

1545
01:30:12,149 --> 01:30:13,241
- I'm teIIing you.
- ReaIIy?

1546
01:30:13,317 --> 01:30:14,306
GentIemen...

1547
01:30:14,385 --> 01:30:16,319
a word?

1548
01:30:28,499 --> 01:30:29,932
Guy.

1549
01:30:30,001 --> 01:30:32,731
I was hoping you'd come by.

1550
01:30:32,803 --> 01:30:34,100
That...

1551
01:30:35,439 --> 01:30:36,804
was amazing.

1552
01:30:38,342 --> 01:30:41,311
I got you something.

1553
01:30:46,517 --> 01:30:48,212
If you want it.

1554
01:30:58,195 --> 01:30:59,321
I do.

1555
01:30:59,397 --> 01:31:03,993
Someone once said that we must become
the change we want to see.

1556
01:31:05,169 --> 01:31:06,761
Mahatma Gandhi.

1557
01:31:06,837 --> 01:31:09,135
CaII boys give themseIves
such goofy names.

1558
01:31:13,310 --> 01:31:14,709
You're weIcome.

1559
01:31:14,779 --> 01:31:16,246
Guy!

1560
01:31:17,148 --> 01:31:19,275
Mr. Foster.

1561
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:20,977
SaIIy.

1562
01:31:24,055 --> 01:31:26,182
I'm going to go get the bike.

1563
01:31:30,227 --> 01:31:32,218
Mr. Foster?

1564
01:31:33,564 --> 01:31:35,862
You'II take care of him for me?

1565
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:40,000
I promise.

1566
01:31:40,071 --> 01:31:44,201
'Cause he'II say he Ioved his dinner
and then Iater you find it in a pIant.

1567
01:31:48,479 --> 01:31:49,468
Thank you.

1568
01:32:00,057 --> 01:32:01,888
You were great in there.

1569
01:32:01,959 --> 01:32:04,757
I didn't overpIay my subtext?

1570
01:32:05,629 --> 01:32:07,529
You're going to be a big star.

1571
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:11,297
And thank you.

1572
01:32:11,368 --> 01:32:15,031
I guess I just couIdn't picture anybody
but you as Ben Hur.

1573
01:32:17,308 --> 01:32:20,675
I don't think I'II be making
any more movies for a whiIe.

1574
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:24,512
But you have to.
You were born for it.

1575
01:32:32,523 --> 01:32:34,787
But I'm through pretending.
