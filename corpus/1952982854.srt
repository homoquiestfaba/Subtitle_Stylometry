Damn, damn, damn!

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,157
Ian, please ... Calm down!

6
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:14,653
Stay calm? The car're locked!
My dad will be pissed if I go without the car!

00:03:14,654 --> 00:03:18,679
Relax, try again tomorrow
with the spare key.

8
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,170
Damn!

9
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,070
Do not think you will
break the car window!

10
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,950
Get out my face!

11
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,760
What the fuck you looking at?

12
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,140
Stop looking at my girlfriend, its tail!
-Ian, please!

13
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,771
You want to fuck it is?
Do not even think about it!

14
00:04:05,515 --> 00:04:08,579
You know she's hot
too much for you as a dwarf.

15
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,075
Then go home
and beat a wank ...

16
00:04:15,501 --> 00:04:16,651
No, please

17
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,960
No!

18
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,150
No, please!

19
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,610
Please do not!

20
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,420
No, please, please ... No!

21
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,400
Ian!

22
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,848
Hey, I have no time to lose ...

23
00:09:26,247 --> 00:09:28,348
I have about 10 people
waiting to see this place.

24
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:31,356
And I just get money.
You have money?

25
00:09:32,855 --> 00:09:35,654
-Lights
The lights are on here ... I think.

26
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,386
Hey, let's sign the damn contract
Or what?

27
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,373
Hello, my name is Mark of the Screen Actors Guild

28
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:40,060
... I am the actress of "The Human Centipede"
He said that is not available ...

29
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:44,085
... is in London
recording a movie.

30
00:12:44,086 --> 00:12:46,520
Thank you for your interest
I hope to help in the future. Goodbye.

31
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,479
Stop crying

32
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,640
If Dad is not going to punish

33
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,289
Oh ... my God!

34
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,569
You shit again?

35
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,409
you pig

36
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,610
I called and Dr.Sebring
he is waiting for you! ...
Get up!

37
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,460
Hello Martin

38
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,470
Martin

39
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,600
Sit here with us.

40
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,460
Well ....

41
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,300
Martin here is your medicine

42
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:11,000
Martin, I came here because
his mother very concerned.

43
00:18:11,906 --> 00:18:14,389
He did not talk to a centipede ...

44
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,449
made up of 12 people!

45
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,600
What does that mean?

46
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,210
Let's see ...

47
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,360
-The centipede can be considered
a phallic symbol ...

48
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:37,510
... animals are very aggressive
and their bites are very painful.

49
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:43,700
Perhaps it is connecting
the pain of the bite of a centipede ...

50
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:49,260
with years of psychological abuse
and sexually by her father.

51
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,670
I miss my husband.

52
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,886
And you are the reason
he's in jail!

53
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:12,471
Sometimes people get
problems because of these abuses

54
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,590
... mutilate their own genitals

55
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,261
Sorry, I gotta go.
There is nothing to worry about.

56
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,080
I'm sure it will pass.

57
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,820
Martin

58
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,360
Good boy.

59
00:20:16,538 --> 00:20:18,434
I decided that we have to kill us

60
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:30,380
This song is me
crazy!

61
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,010
I no longer take any more!

62
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,115
He no longer supports the music!

63
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:19,093
Come on, tell them.
Be a man like your father!

64
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:27,457
I want to say something retarded?
I hear my music as I want!

65
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,499
Kill both of us!
I beg you!

66
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,817
Shut up and fuck, old!

67
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,570
What the hell? ...

68
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:45,284
I will listen to so high that
I'll leave you deaf, ok its tail? ...

69
00:21:46,142 --> 00:21:50,146
If you bother me again
I go down and break your neck, damn it!

70
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:59,533
Dwarf fag, I'll listen to the cd
so high that I will break down the walls.

71
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,084
Cock sucker you moron!

72
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,576
The lips of B to C

73
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,847
and anus from A to B.

74
00:22:38,475 --> 00:22:40,552
intersect in a circle

75
00:22:40,553 --> 00:22:43,851
between the border between the skin and mucosa

76
00:22:53,904 --> 00:22:59,254
Anus and mouth and from A to B
and from B to C

77
00:23:00,449 --> 00:23:07,046
... Connecting the grafts
incisions of the jaw

78
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:21,132
Ingestion of A. .. goes to B

79
00:23:23,312 --> 00:23:26,477
... EC performs the excretion

80
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:32,076
the human centipede

81
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,128
We'll dinner when we get there?

82
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,990
No!

83
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,040
Wow
What are all these numbers?

84
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:06,562
It was one of the most
stupid I did.

85
00:29:11,373 --> 00:29:25,069
Valerie is the face of the club.

86
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,220
Is anyone there?

87
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,260
It has a dwarf masturbating.

88
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,300
You're drunk!
- No, I'm serious!

89
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,845
Hello, here is Ariadne

91
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:45,817

92
00:32:46,894 --> 00:32:49,639

94
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,661
Damn!

95
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,460
It's just a movie!

96
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,519
The Human Centipede is a fucking movie!

97
00:33:22,139 --> 00:33:23,289
He wants to sew us!

98
00:33:26,772 --> 00:33:28,797
He wants to sew the mouth to the tail!

99
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:49,280
stop crying and swallow
everything that excites Dad

100
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,410
What is this?

101
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:35,360
100% of medical accuracy "?

102
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,150
The mouth to the anus?

103
00:35:45,848 --> 00:35:47,428
A single digestive system

104
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,696
This is the movie perverted
you always say?

105
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:01,406
I want it out of my house!

106
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,310
Damn!

107
00:41:49,231 --> 00:41:52,902
Swallow it, bitch ... Swallow

108
00:41:58,533 --> 00:42:01,873
feed it! ... feed her

109
00:42:30,873 --> 00:42:32,598
This was great!

110
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,410
You know what? ...

111
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:40,546
Her pussy is cheirosinha!

112
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:44,240
How's up, Doc?

113
00:42:48,142 --> 00:42:53,169
Oh, I prefer the retarded boy
... but it gives to the expense.

114
00:42:53,998 --> 00:42:56,389
I know a place specialized
these things.

115
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:01,873
Oh yes, she's good, right?

116
00:43:02,844 --> 00:43:04,704
What do you charge to give the tail?

117
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,544
Dear ... $ 50.

118
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,894
Jesus! ... Who the hell are you?

119
00:43:24,424 --> 00:43:26,183
What the fuck have you done?

120
00:43:30,576 --> 00:43:36,289
I'm getting ... keep looking!
Stay there looking ... you pervert!

121
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:37,446
Go away!

122
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:41,034
Before I leave the car and
the thing for you to get ugly

123
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,524
No, please ... please.

124
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:16,780
Martin?

125
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:25,310
I am ... Dr. Sebring!

126
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,152
So ...
This is where you work?

127
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:38,783
This is not right, Martin.

128
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:42,750
What are you doing ... is wrong.

129
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:49,177
Martin ... I can help.

130
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:51,370
but you must give me the gun.

131
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,453
Imagine what his father would say

132
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:05,807
Martin! Martin no, no ...

133
00:46:17,952 --> 00:46:19,102
Please ...

134
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:21,700
... I will not tell anyone.

135
00:46:22,401 --> 00:46:23,551
Please!

136
00:46:24,829 --> 00:46:26,703
No. .. I will not tell anyone.

137
00:46:28,677 --> 00:46:30,961
Fuck it!
Son of a bitch!

138
00:46:33,069 --> 00:46:34,614
Somebody help me!

139
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:31,403
Hello Martin. I am Ariadne.
I called to confirm that Mrs. Yenni

140
00:47:32,903 --> 00:47:36,323
will arrive at London airport at 06 h

141
00:47:36,324 --> 00:47:39,197
I hope that your driver is there

142
00:47:39,198 --> 00:47:42,390
And I hope that everything goes right to the test
Thank you. Goodbye. </ I>

143
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:14,056
I can not believe that you will work
in a Quentin Tarantino.

144
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:18,382
My agents are very happy.

145
00:48:22,422 --> 00:48:26,949
Would not it be better to call him
to say that I'm on my way?

146
00:48:32,008 --> 00:48:33,158
Have you seen The Human Centipede?

147
00:48:36,899 --> 00:48:39,361
I was interested in the film
the medical aspect of the matter.

148
00:48:40,029 --> 00:48:43,755
If you were a surgeon, actually
could do that.

149
00:48:44,425 --> 00:48:45,575
Very scary.

150
00:48:49,562 --> 00:48:55,255
It was hard work ... I demanded, in the contract
one hour massage per night.

151
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:58,014
You know ... Why do not require?

152
00:48:59,021 --> 00:49:03,727
Oh, and we all had to
take a shower before ...

153
00:49:04,579 --> 00:49:08,824
... to stay near the butt of the other.
You will not smell anything, you know?

154
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:11,520
I'm allergic to germs.

155
00:49:28,083 --> 00:49:30,247
Oh!
There seems to Tarantino's car

156
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,822
Do you have an umbrella?
This rain will ruin the hair.

157
00:49:47,778 --> 00:49:48,928
okay.

158
01:06:51,675 --> 01:06:53,680
Please!
Please! ...

159
01:06:55,931 --> 01:06:57,081
... Please do not hurt me!

160
01:06:59,305 --> 01:07:02,814
Please! ...
... I do what you want.

161
01:08:29,911 --> 01:08:32,871
Hi, is the Mark of the Screen Actors Guild
again ...

162
01:08:32,872 --> 01:08:35,865
... Please forget the previous message
Fortunately we got a date on the agenda

163
01:08:35,866 --> 01:08:39,799
... and our customer is excited
to test for Mr. Tarantino.

164
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:44,126
I hope to confirm
that's all right.

165
01:08:44,127 --> 01:08:48,153
Please call me as soon as possible
this phone number.

166
01:08:48,154 --> 01:08:50,104
Thank you,
Hope to see you soon. Goodbye
