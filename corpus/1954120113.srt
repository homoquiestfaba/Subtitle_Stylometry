This is why I've chosen
to be with women.

You know it is. Try it.

How do I do it? Just send it
out there.

774
00:33:38,529 --> 00:33:41,327
Send it, baby. Send it.

775
00:33:41,374 --> 00:33:44,457
Most men I've dated, I would
classify as penetrators.

776
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:47,325
I'm not too big on being
penetrated.

777
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:50,331
Vagina is actually Latin for
sheath.

I just got tired of being
another sheath, you know?

779
00:33:53,553 --> 00:33:54,531
Totally.

00:33:54,587 --> 00:33:56,635
Yeah, okay. We're gonna go.

Have fun.

782
00:34:01,427 --> 00:34:04,419
Your friend, for example,
he's a penetrator.

783
00:34:04,464 --> 00:34:05,852
Will you excuse me
for a second?

784
00:34:08,434 --> 00:34:10,516
Hey, man. Can I get a
whiskey neat, please?

785
00:34:10,529 --> 00:34:11,621
Thanks.

786
00:34:13,531 --> 00:34:14,793

Send that E. Send it.

789
00:34:31,717 --> 00:34:36,450
Come on. Look at me. I
command you to look at me.

790
00:34:36,496 --> 00:34:38,009
What am I doing?
Oh my gosh.

791
00:34:38,064 --> 00:34:42,080
Just go over there
and talk to her, you lunatic.

792
00:34:42,135 --> 00:34:45,650
Stop talking to yourself.
That would be really smart.

00:35:05,718 --> 00:35:07,345

On the way back to The
Cave, thank you very much.

797
00:35:10,597 --> 00:35:12,679
Oh, who cares, man?
It's all bullshit anyway.

798

Ooh, I'm getting serious E.

801
00:35:18,897 --> 00:35:20,455
- What is that?
- It's energy.

802
00:35:20,507 --> 00:35:21,792
I know what it is, Pete.

803
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,894
I'm asking what it really
means. What does it say?

804
00:35:24,944 --> 00:35:26,593
What are we doing here?

805
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:28,864
I know you're
here to hook up, Jay.

806
00:35:28,915 --> 00:35:31,065
I'm just asking
what does it say

807
00:35:31,117 --> 00:35:33,506
about the human condition?

808
00:35:33,512 --> 00:35:36,572
The human condition.

809
00:35:36,623 --> 00:35:39,979
What does my wanting to
get laid have anything to do

810
00:35:40,026 --> 00:35:41,914
with the human condition?

811
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,683
I'm just
asking questions, man.

812
00:35:43,689 --> 00:35:46,578
Well, I'll tell you one thing.
It is no more misguided

813
00:35:46,592 --> 00:35:48,890
than your idiotic quest
to find the one.

814
00:35:48,935 --> 00:35:50,118
You think it's misguided?

815
00:35:50,129 --> 00:35:52,620
It's completely misguided.

816
00:35:52,631 --> 00:35:56,761
Finding the one is a
inherently false concept.

817
00:35:56,769 --> 00:35:58,532
You know, people have
[stammers] this

818
00:35:58,578 --> 00:36:00,626
fairy tale expectation
that sex is no longer

819
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:03,597
gonna be fucking,
it's gonna be making love.

820
00:36:03,609 --> 00:36:05,099
And you know what?

821
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:07,101
They will make love
for a while

822
00:36:07,112 --> 00:36:09,171
and then they'll just
want to fuck again.

823
00:36:09,181 --> 00:36:10,842
And you know what?

824
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:13,647
You're gonna think about
this. You're gonna think,

825
00:36:13,693 --> 00:36:16,844
why do I want to fuck
the person that I love?

826
00:36:16,896 --> 00:36:18,511
And then you'll realize

827
00:36:18,565 --> 00:36:20,681
that you never really loved
that person.

828
00:36:20,733 --> 00:36:24,624
Instead, you loved the idea
of being in love

829
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,120
with that person, so that
person was never truly

830
00:36:26,131 --> 00:36:29,692
the one, she was your idea
of what the one should be.

831
00:36:29,701 --> 00:36:30,861
It's a mind fuck.

832
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:32,200
You're a sad man, Jay.

833
00:36:32,245 --> 00:36:33,564
I'm an honest man.

834
00:36:33,572 --> 00:36:35,199
Pete, help me out here.

835
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:41,132
I have a test. It's called
The Mud Puddle Test.

836
00:36:41,187 --> 00:36:44,668
Yeah, say I'm walking
with my girl down the street

837
00:36:44,724 --> 00:36:46,510
and she somehow manages
to slip and fall

838
00:36:46,518 --> 00:36:49,544
Somehow manages? Pete
what are you talking about?

839
00:36:49,596 --> 00:36:50,676
No, no, no. I'm serious.

840
00:36:50,689 --> 00:36:52,020
Look, there
are two outcomes.

841
00:36:52,065 --> 00:36:53,817
Either she laughs about it
or complains about it.

842
00:36:53,867 --> 00:36:55,983
The good girl's always
gonna laugh about it, right?

843
00:36:56,035 --> 00:36:59,687
But the one, the woman
you're gonna marry,

844
00:36:59,698 --> 00:37:02,724
she's gonna drag you right
into that puddle with her.

845
00:37:02,775 --> 00:37:04,788
See how that works?

846
00:37:04,844 --> 00:37:06,835
Pete, are you like,

847
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:08,761
pushing all your dates
into mud puddles?

848
00:37:08,815 --> 00:37:11,704
No no, idiot. No.
I just imagine what each one

849
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:14,838
of them would be like in that
situation, based on signs

850
00:37:14,888 --> 00:37:16,901
I've gotten
while we were dating.

851
00:37:16,956 --> 00:37:18,036
And Beth?

852
00:37:19,851 --> 00:37:23,184
I don't even know anymore.

853
00:37:23,188 --> 00:37:24,780
What about you, Andre?

854
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:27,588
Me? I love Anna.

855
00:37:27,634 --> 00:37:28,714
Who's Anna?

856
00:37:28,727 --> 00:37:30,058
She lives in New York.

857
00:37:30,103 --> 00:37:31,855
But I thought that Rosa
was your girl.

858
00:37:31,905 --> 00:37:33,623
No, Anna's his girl girl.

859
00:37:33,673 --> 00:37:35,254
So does Anna sleep
with other people?

860
00:37:35,308 --> 00:37:37,731
No. How do you know?

861
00:37:37,777 --> 00:37:38,926
She's a good girl.

862
00:37:38,937 --> 00:37:39,824
But you do.

863
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:41,260
I'm a bad boy.

864
00:37:41,314 --> 00:37:43,771
And you love her?

865
00:37:43,816 --> 00:37:46,865
Love is comfort.
At least for me, it's comfort.

866
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:49,643
It's knowing she'll be there
whenever I need her.

867
00:37:49,648 --> 00:37:50,842
It's like this lighter.

868
00:37:50,849 --> 00:37:52,612
I love this lighter

869
00:37:52,618 --> 00:37:54,745
cause I know it's always
gonna work.

870
00:37:54,794 --> 00:37:58,912
So you love Anna
like you love your lighter?

871
00:37:58,965 --> 00:38:00,250
He loves his lighter more.

872
00:38:00,259 --> 00:38:01,954
I need a lighter.

873
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,690
She's the one.

874
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,860
A toast then,
to finding the one.

875
00:38:08,908 --> 00:38:11,888
No, no.

876
00:38:11,945 --> 00:38:15,199
A toast to lying, cheating,
stealing,

877
00:38:15,207 --> 00:38:16,936
lying for your friends,
cheating death,

878
00:38:16,983 --> 00:38:18,871
and stealing ladies' hearts.

879
00:38:18,877 --> 00:38:22,677
I'll catch you guys later.

880
00:38:22,681 --> 00:38:23,875
What the fuck?

881
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,578
Dean! You all right?

882
00:38:32,591 --> 00:38:34,047
Yeah. I'm just--

883
00:38:35,267 --> 00:38:36,757
Yeah, I'm fine.

884
00:38:36,762 --> 00:38:38,889
Look, if it makes any
difference,

885
00:38:38,897 --> 00:38:41,058
I get what you're saying.

886
00:38:41,107 --> 00:38:43,155
You going back
to The Cave?

887
00:38:44,769 --> 00:38:47,863
Nah. No.

888
00:38:47,914 --> 00:38:49,165
I know.

889
00:38:49,215 --> 00:38:50,603
Give her my best.

890
00:38:50,609 --> 00:38:51,598
I will.

891
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:52,895
- Bye, buddy.
- Later.

892
00:38:54,879 --> 00:38:58,144

1069
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:46,597
Beautiful!

1070
00:47:46,611 --> 00:47:47,771
Great.

1071
00:47:47,779 --> 00:47:48,871
Totally.

1072
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,768
So...

1073
00:47:50,782 --> 00:47:54,411
don't you have
that thing tonight?

1074
00:47:54,419 --> 00:47:57,513
Right. Yes. My thing.
That thing. I gotta--

1075
00:47:57,563 --> 00:47:58,848
Hey, you don't
wanna be late.

1076
00:47:58,857 --> 00:48:01,712
Yeah, I will see you guys,
I'll catch up with you--

1077
00:48:01,767 --> 00:48:02,882
Yeah. Good luck with that.

1078
00:48:02,935 --> 00:48:04,379
Yeah. Okay.

1079
00:48:04,436 --> 00:48:06,119
Yeah, good luck.

1080
00:48:21,512 --> 00:48:24,345
Remember that Latino girl
I used to date?

1081
00:48:24,349 --> 00:48:27,409
- You mean Alicia?
- Yeah. That's the one.

1082
00:48:27,418 --> 00:48:29,545
You know, I took her to one
of those rooftop joints once?

1083
00:48:29,595 --> 00:48:33,213
Yeah man. Did the three D's:
drinks, dinner, dancing.

1084
00:48:33,265 --> 00:48:34,914
That kind of thing.
Anyway, picture this:

1085
00:48:34,967 --> 00:48:38,585
midnight rolls along and we
stroll out onto the deck

1086
00:48:38,637 --> 00:48:41,356
and there was this gigantic
moon thatjust sort of

1087
00:48:41,407 --> 00:48:44,365
hung right over the city,
lit up the entire sky.

1088
00:48:44,369 --> 00:48:45,654
And there was this gentle
breeze that kept

1089
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:48,434
lifting her hair. It was
perfect.

1090
00:48:48,439 --> 00:48:49,701
This is perfect.

1091
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:55,399
And let me guess? She
gave you the old blow job

1092
00:48:55,454 --> 00:48:57,206
right then and there
on the deck?

1093
00:48:57,256 --> 00:49:00,214
No, man.
It wasn't about that.

1094
00:49:02,427 --> 00:49:05,442
It was just a moment. You
know? A perfect moment.

1095
00:49:05,497 --> 00:49:07,545
Everything about
the evening,

1096
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:09,515
everything around us
was perfect. I knew it.

1097
00:49:09,527 --> 00:49:11,552
She knew it.
And at that moment,

1098
00:49:11,604 --> 00:49:14,493
just for one moment,

1099
00:49:14,499 --> 00:49:17,297
I thought I loved her.

1100
00:49:17,302 --> 00:49:18,428
Did you tell her this?

1101
00:49:18,477 --> 00:49:20,263
Nah. Nah. Nah.
I didn't tell her.

1102
00:49:20,271 --> 00:49:21,397
- Why not?
- I couldn't.

1103
00:49:21,447 --> 00:49:25,565
Because the moment
passed as quickly as it came

1104
00:49:25,618 --> 00:49:28,974
and I realized I don't love
the girl. I love the moment.

1105
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,574
See for me, it was always
about the moment.

1106
00:49:31,624 --> 00:49:33,808
Well, until I met Anna.

1107
00:49:35,419 --> 00:49:39,583
Do you not have perfect
moments with Anna?

1108
00:49:39,591 --> 00:49:41,957
Nah. See with Anna,

1109
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,791
I never even thought about
perfect moments.

1110
00:49:43,836 --> 00:49:45,724
Never even tried
to look for 'em.

1111
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:49,461
Then I got to thinking about
that and I realized that

1112
00:49:49,467 --> 00:49:53,665
every moment I had
with Anna was perfect

1113
00:49:53,671 --> 00:49:56,595
because I loved her

1114
00:49:56,608 --> 00:49:59,668
and I realized that love is the
perfect moment

1115
00:49:59,718 --> 00:50:01,436
that never ends.

1116
00:50:03,981 --> 00:50:08,008
So why aren't you with her
now, man?

1117
00:50:08,019 --> 00:50:10,908
Ah, she's in, she's in, she's
in New York

1118
00:50:10,963 --> 00:50:11,782
and I moved to LA.

1119
00:50:11,789 --> 00:50:18,456

moment--it's out there.

So I'm just going
to come right out with it.

1144
00:51:31,669 --> 00:51:36,697
I sort of went through this
experimental phase.

1145

What? Like a drug thing?

1146

this really crazy phase

not that long ago.

Oh God. Is this too much
for you? I'm sorry,

reveal too much too soon.

No. No. No. No.
I totally get it.

1155
00:52:06,871 --> 00:52:08,964
It's like, how much are you
willing to reveal?

1156
00:52:09,014 --> 00:52:10,970
And how soon do you finally
reveal yourself?

1157
00:52:11,016 --> 00:52:13,735
Like how long do you have
to play the part of the person

1158
00:52:13,786 --> 00:52:17,438

settle into playing the part
