¶ Here, there's hills

¶ Here, there's psychic

00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:37,436
¶ It feels fine ¶

¶ For all to shine. ¶

15
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:21,847
Well, that's what's brilliant
about you, Mr. Feldman.

16
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:24,516
No one else would have thought
of building

17
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:25,451
a residential mini-mall.

18
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:27,753
Now that I've got everyone
else on the block

19
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:29,254
to agree to your offer,
I think we're...

20
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:32,624
It's got to be everyone
on the block... <i> everyone...</i>

21
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:34,093
or the deal's off.

22
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:36,295
Oh, we're headed
into the canyon.

23
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:37,629
I think I'm losing you.

24
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:38,797
Mr. Feldman.

25
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,365
Cut the crap, Dittmeyer.

26
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,201
Did you get everyone or not?

27
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:45,471
Well, there's this one family
that's holding out.

28
00:01:45,473 --> 00:01:47,139
Then sweeten the deal.

29
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:47,773
Up the offer.

30
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:48,674
It's not that simple.

31
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:51,443
It's like they're not interested
in money.

32
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,612
It's like they're not normal.

33
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:54,880
Why the hell not?

34
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:56,682
What's their story?

35
00:01:56,684 --> 00:02:00,486
¶ Here's the story
of a lovely lady ¶

36
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:04,590
¶ Who was bringing up
three very lovely girls ¶

37
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:09,661
¶ All of them had hair of gold
like their mother ¶

38
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:11,897
¶ The youngest one in curls ¶

39
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:15,868
¶ It's a story
of a man named Brady ¶

40
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,404
¶ Who was busy with three boys
of his own ¶

41
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:23,876
¶ They were four men
living all together ¶

42
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:26,912
¶ Yet they were all alone ¶

43
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:30,315
¶ Till the one day
when the lady met this fellow ¶

44
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,886
¶ And they knew that it was
much more than a hunch ¶

45
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:37,756
¶ That this group must
somehow form a family ¶

46
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:41,660
¶ That's the way we all became
the Brady Bunch ¶

47
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,396
¶ The Brady Bunch ¶

48
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,731
¶ The Brady Bunch ¶

49
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:51,703
¶ That's the way we became
the Brady Bunch. ¶

50
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,598
Don't worry about me.

51
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,967
I'm okay.

52
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:23,769
Morning, Mrs. Brady.

53
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:24,937
Oh, thanks, Alice.

54
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:25,604
Morning, Alice.

55
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:28,874
Careful, Mr. Brady.
Don't bend over.

56
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:31,410
We've gotten

57
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:33,612
the Dittmeyers' mail
again, sweetheart.

58
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,581
You'd think, after
all these years

59
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,848
they'd know who lives where.

60
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,819
Well, I always know where
to deliver my mail.

61
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:41,486
Mr. Brady...

62
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:43,222
Mommy, Marcia's been

63
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:45,357
in the bathroom for
a super-long time.

64
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:46,858
Now, Cindy, we've
told you before...

65
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,794
no one likes a tattletale.

66
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:50,229
But, Daddy...

67
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:51,663
Your father's right,
sweetheart.

68
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:52,464
Why don't you

69
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:53,932
help Alice make some cookies?

70
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:54,866
Okay, Mommy.

71
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:57,236
But can my doll help, too?

72
00:03:57,238 --> 00:03:59,271
As long as it's
not Betsy Wetsy.

73
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:02,341
She makes my cookies
soggy woggy.

74
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:03,775
Oh, Alice.

75
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,278
Mmm.

76
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,314
4,998...

77
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:10,983
Come on, Marcia, open up.

78
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:12,884
I've got to shave.

79
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:14,720
4,999...

80
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:18,790
Gosh, Marcia, there are
other people in this family

81
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,259
besides you.

82
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,361
5,000.

83
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:23,028
Come on, Marcia.

84
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,466
Doug Simpson's sure
to notice me today.

85
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:29,268
All finished.

86
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,302
Finally.

87
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:30,569
Greg.

88
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:33,839
Jan, you're just going
to have to wait your turn.

89
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:36,275
It's never my turn.

90
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:46,551
Jan, did you move my trophies?

91
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,754
Yes. I couldn't look
in the mirror

92
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:53,525
without seeing the awards
of the great Marcia Brady.

93
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:58,830
I believe these are
my white kneesocks.

94
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:02,801
Not everything in
this room is yours.

95
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,809
See, Jan? I told you
they were mine.

96
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,712
Now, put them back,
and don't forget to close

97
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,847
the drawer when you're done.

98
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,650
<i>She has every right to be mad.</i>

99
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,485
<i>They</i> are<i> her socks.</i>

100
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,755
<i>But why does Marcia get</i>
<i>all the socks?</i>

101
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:26,391
<i>Why does Marcia get</i>
<i>all the trophies?</i>

102
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:30,495
<i>Why does Marcia get</i>
<i>all the good drawers?</i>

103
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:34,599
Yeah. Why does Marcia
get everything?

104
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,637
Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.

105
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:42,808
It's closed!

106
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,643
Come on, Greg. Hurry up.

107
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:48,413
Boy, he's worse than Marcia.

108
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,081
Hmm.

109
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,650
Hey, what's wrong
with your voice?

110
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:55,020
Well, my libido is increasing
at a rapid rate

111
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,121
and the surge of hormones

112
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:59,825
causes dramatic physical
and emotional changes.

113
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:04,830
Well, that's what Miss Lynley
told us in health class.

114
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:06,531
Finally.

115
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:06,898
Yeah.

116
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,669
Well, you kids have no idea what
it takes to impress a chick.

117
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,003
Maybe, someday,
when you're older

118
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:15,707
you'll get hip
to what it's like being a man.

119
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,075
Good news, Greg.

120
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:20,746
I'm putting on your favorite
Scooby Doo bedsheets.

121
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:24,883
Scooby Dooby doo!

122
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:29,554
Honey, I think you've
stirred that enough.

123
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,021
I'm not stirring.

124
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:34,893
I'm looking for
Kitty Carryall's underpants.

125
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:35,794
I tell you what.

126
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:37,662
Why don't I take
over the cookies,

127
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,798
and you run these letters
to the Dittmeyers

128
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,769
and see if they've gotten
any of our mail by mistake.

129
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:45,404
Okay, Mommy.

130
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:03,054
Missy,

131
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:04,956
get your butt-ugly face
down here!

132
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,192
Hello, Eric.
Are your parents home?

133
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:09,961
Blow off, cheeseball.

134
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,930
Missy!

135
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:15,801
Shut up before you
have a toxic dump.

136
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:16,435
Hello, Missy.

137
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:18,670
How's your science project
coming?

138
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:19,538
I finished mine.

139
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,039
What are you going to do?

140
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,642
Hand in your face
and call it barf mold?

141
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:28,647
Thee you on the theethaw,
Thindy.

142
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:29,369
Bye.

143
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,521
Look, Mr. Feldman, I promised
they'd sell, and they will.

144
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:37,055
Like the Bates deal.

145
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,457
Yeah, I know I took
it in the rear

146
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:39,458
on that subdivision,
but this time,

147
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,625
I'm the one
who's doing the screwing.

148
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,694
Yeah, well, just make sure
one holdout family

149
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:44,463
doesn't wreck this. You hear me?

150
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:45,130
Look, can I call you back?

151
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,865
Yeah. Thanks.

152
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,934
Hello, Mr. Dittmeyer.

153
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:51,136
Why are you here?

154
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:52,103
Oh.

155
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:53,171
Thanks.

156
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:53,905
Mom asked me to ask you

157
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,974
if there's mail for us here
by mistake.

158
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,843
I... I don't understand you.

159
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:59,177
What do you want?

160
00:07:59,179 --> 00:07:59,945
Mom asked me to ask you

161
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:02,914
if there's any mail for us here
by mistake.

162
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:03,949
What?

163
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:04,683
Mom asked me to ask you

164
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:07,252
if there's any mail
for us here by mistake.

165
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:08,053
Nope. Not a clue.

166
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:12,057
She wants the Bradys' mail,
Larry!

167
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:12,824
Thank you, darling.

168
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,627
So kind of you to climb out
from under your hangover.

169
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,829
Let's see.
Where did I file your mail?

170
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,231
Oh, yes.

171
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,903
Hi, honey.

172
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:25,637
Hi.

173
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,972
How's your daddy?

174
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:27,572
He's fine.

175
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:29,541
Mrs. Brady's lucky

176
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:33,144
to have a big, strong,
virile man like that.

177
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:36,948
Tell you what, sweetie.

178
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,116
Next Christmas,
you tell you daddy

179
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:41,019
I'd be more than happy
to wrap his package.

180
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:41,953
Okay.

181
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:42,821
Here. Hit the road, bad seed.

182
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:46,091
Excuse me, but the juice
will make your shoes slip.

183
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:47,759
What?

184
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:50,562
Your shoes'll slip in the juice.

185
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:52,697
Oh.

186
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,033
Bye.

187
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,202
Bye-bye.

188
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:10,949
Daddy, Mrs. Dittmeyer said
that she'd be glad

189
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:13,952
to wrap your package
this Christmas.

190
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:15,854
Hmm... really?

191
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:17,622
How is Mrs. Dittmeyer?

192
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:20,325
Mr. Dittmeyer says
she's overhung.

193
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:22,093
But he's not in a good mood

194
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:25,230
because she's taking it
in the rear.

195
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,932
Must be that paperboy again.

196
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:30,235
Cindy, that's
Mr. Dittmeyer's business.

197
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,170
Remember, nobody likes a snitch.

198
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:33,238
I'm not a snitch.

199
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,739
I just tell it like it is.

200
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,841
You know, Cindy, when
you tattle on someone,

201
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,310
you're not just
telling on them.

202
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:39,611
You're telling on yourself.

203
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:40,979
And, by tattling on someone,

204
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:43,348
you're really
just telling them,

205
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,149
"I'm a tattletale."

206
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:46,585
Now, is that the tale
you want to tell?

207
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:49,054
I never thought
of it like that.

208
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:51,289
Sweetheart, it's time to get

209
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,325
your school things
together, honey.

210
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:55,894
Okay, Mommy.

211
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:57,762
Hmm...

212
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:58,797
What is it, Mike?

213
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,131
It's a letter from the county.

214
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:03,702
They say we haven't paid
our property taxes.

215
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:05,236
Haven't paid our taxes?

216
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,338
We always pay our taxes.

217
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,673
Well, they say it's
the fifth notice

218
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:11,910
and we owe them $20,000
by the end of the week

219
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:14,145
or they'll auction our house.

220
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,147
$20,000?!

221
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,249
There has to be a mix-up.

222
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,719
Well, we better call someone.

223
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:22,087
We are?

224
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:23,655
You do?

225
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:25,857
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

226
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,359
I see.

227
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:29,127
We should?!

228
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,629
You are?!

229
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:31,663
Uh-huh.

230
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:34,899
All right. Good-bye.

231
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,137
We owe them.

232
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,105
Oh, Mike.

233
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:42,140
Well, don't you worry, honey.

234
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,842
We'll find the money.

235
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:44,843
Find the money?

236
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,111
But we used our savings

237
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:49,214
to go to the Grand
Canyon and Hawaii.

238
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:52,684
What are we going to do, Mike?

239
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,189
Okay, troops...

240
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:59,858
time for school!

241
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,825
Greg!

242
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:01,860
Marcia!

243
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:02,927
Peter!

244
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:03,862
Jan!

245
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:04,863
Bobby!

246
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:05,797
Cindy!

247
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:06,965
Oh! Oh!

248
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:07,832
Oh! Oh!

249
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,735
Do we always have
to walk so close?

250
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,070
Oh, Jan.

251
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:14,673
Uh... Mom, can I borrow
your car today?

252
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,341
I want to ask Donna Leonard

253
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,343
to go out for a soda
after school.

254
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,012
All right, but no hot-rodding.

255
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:21,379
Thanks, Mom.

256
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:24,449
She's the most far-out chick
in my class.

257
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:26,117
You wouldn't believe

258
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,385
how much I dig her.

259
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:28,086
Sure, I would.

260
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:29,888
I've been digging Sam so long,

261
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,189
by the time he proposes,

262
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,457
I'll be six feet under.

263
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:37,262
Oh, Alice, what would
we do without you?

264
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:38,963
Probably eat out.

265
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:43,835
Hey, why the long face, Bobby?

266
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:47,105
Well, ever since I became
a safety monitor

267
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,239
at school...

268
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:49,340
nobody will talk to me.

269
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:51,810
They think I'm
some kind of fink.

270
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:53,845
Bobby, people
like to be corrected

271
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:55,947
when they're doing
something wrong.

272
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:58,383
That's how
we improve ourselves.

273
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,051
Right, Dad.

274
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,187
And, if your sister
would wear her glasses,

275
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:03,855
she just might
improve her eyesight.

276
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:06,124
Marcia doesn't
have to wear glasses.

277
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:07,992
Besides, all my friends
at school

278
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:10,195
say glasses make me
look positively goofy.

279
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:14,866
Now, honey, you look very lovely
with your glasses on.

280
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:16,034
Doesn't she, kids?

281
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:18,303
Far out, Jan. Yeah. Yeah.

282
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:19,337
You look great.

283
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,699
Yeah, I mean it. Outtasight.

284
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,844
All right, troops,
off to school.

285
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:26,945
Good-bye.

286
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:27,512
Have a good day.

287
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:29,180
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, Dad.

288
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,081
Bye, Mom.

289
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,116
Come on, Marcia.

290
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:32,016
I'm coming.

291
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:33,118
Jan, a real friend

292
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,452
likes you for who you are,

293
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,321
not what's on your face.

294
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:37,756
If you judge your friends

295
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:38,890
for passing judgment on you,

296
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,191
you're not only
judging yourself

297
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,160
you're judging your
friends for judging you.

298
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:43,928
And that would be
using bad judgment.

299
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,865
I never thought of it that way.

300
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,167
Jan?

301
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,370
Oh.

302
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:57,876
Bye.

303
00:12:57,878 --> 00:12:59,844
Bye, honey.

304
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:17,462
Bye, Bobby.

305
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,264
Bye, Jan.

306
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,167
Oh!

307
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:28,306
Oh! Oh!

308
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,347
Ow!

309
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:47,058
Stupid little
punk kid, stay out

310
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,359
of the road!

311
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,234
Davy Jones is the most.

312
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:57,902
I sure wish he'd write back.

313
00:13:57,904 --> 00:13:59,270
I wrote him over a month ago.

314
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:01,940
But, Marcia, he gets
millions of letters.

315
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:04,209
But<i> I'm</i> president
of his fan club

316
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:04,943
and I invited him

317
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:06,945
to entertain
at the school dance.

318
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,179
A big rock star like that

319
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:11,249
can't just drop everything
for our dance.

320
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:13,351
Geez, you can be
so silly sometimes.

321
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,553
Everybody out.
This is a carjack.

322
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:17,455
Well, of course this is a car.

323
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:20,491
But my name's not Jack...
it's Greg.

324
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,927
And this is my sister Marcia.

325
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:23,962
Hi.

326
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:24,295
And you are?

327
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:26,297
Eddie. Wait a minute.
Didn't you hear me?

328
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,131
Get out now!

329
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:28,600
This is a carjacking.

330
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:30,635
Greg, I think
he has a flat tire.

331
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:32,470
He must need a jack.

332
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:33,338
Sorry, Eddie.

333
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,106
We don't have a jack.

334
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,474
But don't worry. I'll call AAA

335
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:37,508
as soon as we get to school.

336
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,978
It was so nice to meet you.

337
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,578
Bye-bye.

338
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:43,882
Hey, you moron!

339
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:46,317
Out of the way, jerk!

340
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,453
Now, don't worry
about the house, honey.

341
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:51,990
I'm sure Mr. Phillips
will advance me the money.

342
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:53,157
Oh, of course he will.

343
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:55,660
You're the best
player on his team.

344
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:58,329
Mmm. Go get 'em, tiger.

345
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,032
Tiger... Tiger...

346
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:04,235
Whatever happened to that dog?

347
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,169
Ha! Brady.

348
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:05,670
Morning, Larry.

349
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:09,540
You know, I was just reading
about some beautiful property

350
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:10,241
available up in Utah.

351
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,278
I'll bet you'd feel
right at home there.

352
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,113
Blue skies,
clean living, Osmonds.

353
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:19,083
Thanks, Larry, but I'm
still not interested in moving.

354
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:19,651
I love this house.

355
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:22,954
Carol loves it, the kids
love it, Alice loves it.

356
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:25,323
It was our first house
all together.

357
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:26,491
Half a mil...
take it or leave it.

358
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:31,396
Like I said, there's nothing
that could get us to sell.

359
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,665
I designed this house myself.

360
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:35,099
It's in perfect condition.

361
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:40,271
Carol thinks so, the kids
think so, Alice thinks so.

362
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,139
Sorry.

363
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:45,076
Well, you can't blame a guy
for trying, huh?

364
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,950
Putz.

365
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:01,392
Uh... excuse me,
Mr. Dittmeyer...

366
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:03,294
but, as a member
of the safety patrol,

367
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,730
I must warn you
that your hedge is overgrown

368
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:08,199
and can block the view
of the street

369
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:09,067
for oncoming traffic.

370
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:10,735
I know this
because I was on my bike

371
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:13,237
and checked out
the sight lines myself.

372
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:15,440
Hmm. Well, you see, Billy...

373
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:16,107
Bobby.

374
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:16,741
Like it matters.

375
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:19,477
I grew my hedge tall
for a reason.

376
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:22,680
So I wouldn't have
to see your family.

377
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:25,516
Thank you for your concern.

378
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,328
<i>Loco! Loco!</i>

379
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:41,666
You are standing too close
to the vehicle.

380
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:45,403
¶ I've seen the future,
and this is... ¶

381
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,723
¶ ...warmer, girl ¶

382
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:09,027
¶ Making the music softer... ¶

383
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,631
See you later.

384
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,305
Hey, there, groovy chick.

385
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:21,807
Oh, great.

386
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:26,444
Do I look like a yellow,
fuzzy baby bird to you?

387
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:27,345
Hey, that's funny, Donna.

388
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:30,782
You know, you are really
happening in a far-out way.

389
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:31,716
How about you and me

390
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,751
going out for a soda
after school?

391
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:35,153
Sorry. I got a step class.

392
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:36,554
If you're having
problems with your steps

393
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,490
maybe you should let me carry
your books to history class.

394
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:43,227
I can hold my own books,
and it's not history...

395
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,229
it's "herstory."

396
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,597
Wow.

397
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:52,603
Hi, everybody.

398
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:57,475
¶ A goddess on a mountaintop ¶

399
00:17:57,477 --> 00:18:03,714
¶ Was burnin'
like a silver flame... ¶

400
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:04,582
Hey, Marcia.

401
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,683
Hello, Doug Simpson.

402
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:08,319
¶ And Venus was her name... ¶

403
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:10,455
God, she drives me crazy!

404
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:12,723
I got to have that.

405
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,792
I live next door to her.

406
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:16,561
And she's harder to get into

407
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:18,196
than a Pearl Jam concert.

408
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:20,465
What are you guys talking about?

409
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:23,234
Just how twisted
the Bradys are.

410
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:24,302
Especially Marcia.

411
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:25,770
What a retro-wannabe.

412
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,206
I think Peter's a babe.

413
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:31,409
Well, in a Gilligan
sort of way.

414
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:32,743
What, are you nuts?

415
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:34,846
Biology.

416
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:36,647
Take notes.

417
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:39,617
What?

418
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,719
¶ Wow! ¶

419
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:43,154
¶ She's got it ¶

420
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:47,158
¶ Yeah, baby, she's got it... ¶

421
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,328
Hi, Marcia.

422
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:50,595
Hi.

423
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:53,331
Oh, guess what? My mom
said I can sleep over.

424
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:53,731
Oh, really?

425
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,833
That's great, Noreen.
Guess what else.

426
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:57,635
Doug just said hi to me.

427
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,537
He is so dreamy, isn't he?

428
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:00,872
Yeah, I guess.

429
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,341
If you like

430
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:04,208
that sort of thing.

431
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,445
So, can I carry your books
to class?

432
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:08,846
Sure, Noreen.

433
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:12,350
After all, you are
my best friend.

434
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:13,684
Uh-oh.

435
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:15,153
Here comes Doug.

436
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:15,520
Go away.

437
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:16,387
Sure.

438
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:17,288
No, no. Stay.

439
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:17,822
Okay.

440
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,223
No, no. Leave.

441
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:19,490
Fine.

442
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:19,891
No, no. Stay.

443
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:21,192
And pretend I just said

444
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:22,827
something really funny.

445
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,262
What? Oh.

446
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:27,231
Hi, Marcia.

447
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:30,334
What's up?

448
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:30,935
Oh. Um... hi, Doug.

449
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:32,203
Listen, I was just wondering,

450
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:32,937
if you're not doing anything.

451
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:36,507
Friday night,
maybe you'd like to go

452
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,808
to the dance with me.

453
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,478
Sure. That would be a blast.

454
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:43,548
Cool. You'll hear from me.

455
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,949
Great.

456
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,555
He's so outtasight.

457
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:54,225
Oh, my gosh!

458
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:55,893
I just remembered.

459
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:56,594
What?

460
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:57,562
I already told Charlie

461
00:19:57,564 --> 00:20:00,198
I would go to the
dance with him.

462
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,431
So?

463
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:02,967
So I can't go out
with two boys at once.

464
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:06,971
I like Charlie,
but Doug is so cute.

465
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:11,242
And, after all,
he<i> is</i> the big man on campus.

466
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:13,411
Noreen, what am I going to do?

467
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:17,949
This is the worst mess
I've ever gotten myself into.

468
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:19,250
The worst!

469
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:19,884
Oh...

470
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:21,986
My life is over!

471
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,525
So, that is what
males experience

472
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:29,527
during the onset of puberty.

473
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:33,364
Now, as far as the young women
are concerned...

474
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:36,634
First, we begin with ovulation
and its effect

475
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:39,437
on the female body.

476
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:41,639
Peter?

477
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:42,740
Yes, Miss Lynley?

478
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,609
Why don't you come up here

479
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:47,612
and take the pointer...
and we will trace

480
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:50,014
the path of the ovum
through the fallopian tube,

481
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:55,953
where the uterine lining
is flushed through the vagina.

482
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,290
Ohh...

483
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:01,359
Oh! Peter!

484
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:03,728
Peter!

485
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:07,365
So, Jan, what can
I help you with?

486
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:08,966
Teen pregnancy?

487
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:09,967
Bulimia?

488
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:12,036
Suicidal tendencies?

489
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:15,906
No. It's my stupid glasses.

490
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:17,508
Oh.

491
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,609
I know I should wear them.

492
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,445
I look at myself
in the mirror every morning

493
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:24,482
and I say to myself,
"Jan, put on your glasses."

494
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:27,852
But then I say,
"You look like a super creep.

495
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:28,452
Take them off."

496
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:31,889
It's like my head tells me
to do different things

497
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:33,391
and I get very confused.

498
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:34,659
Inner voices?

499
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:36,661
Good. That's good.

500
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:38,362
Let's explore that.

501
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:39,897
<i>What does she mean,</i>
<i>"inner voices"?</i>

502
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:42,466
<i>I don't think that's</i>
<i>any of her business.</i>

503
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,303
<i>But it's her job</i>
<i>to ask questions.</i>

504
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:47,071
<i>You are so dumb.</i>

505
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:49,607
I don't have "inner voices."

506
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:50,608
Now, Jan,

507
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:53,311
paranoid schizophrenia
is very common

508
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,780
amongst children
of blended families.

509
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:58,883
You<i> are</i> the middle
child, aren't you?

510
00:21:58,885 --> 00:21:59,517
<i>Middle child?</i>

511
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,453
<i>Don't you mean</i>
<i>Marcia Brady's little sister?</i>

512
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:06,724
<i>Wait a minute.</i>
<i>She's just trying to help.</i>

513
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:07,825
<i>Help? Wake up!</i>

514
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:11,629
<i>She's just looking for</i>
<i>an excuse to bring up Marcia.</i>

515
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:13,064
<i>Marcia! Marcia! Marcia!</i>

516
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:15,333
Yes! I'm in the middle!

517
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:18,903
Well, it sounds like
you have a serious case

518
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:20,071
of...

519
00:22:20,073 --> 00:22:22,006
"middle child syndrome."

520
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:23,808
But you needn't worry.

521
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:26,711
Here's a copy of my book...

522
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:29,580
and my tapes.

523
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:30,881
In the meantime,

524
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:33,851
do something
to make yourself stand out...

525
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,354
give you your own look...

526
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:39,023
apart from your siblings.

527
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,925
A new look.

528
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:41,625
That's it.

529
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:44,995
Gee, thanks, Mrs. Cummings.

530
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,431
Jan, come back

531
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:49,467
when you're pregnant.

532
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:53,671
And, girl, you better work.

533
00:22:53,673 --> 00:22:55,673
¶ Work it down ¶

534
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:57,108
¶ Do your thing... ¶

535
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:00,678
There ain't no justice!

536
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,912
Hi, Holly.

537
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:02,580
Hi.

538
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:04,382
Can I give you a hand?

539
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:05,883
Yeah. Thanks.

540
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:08,419
I'm over here.

541
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:11,689
Hey...

542
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:13,457
Petey.

543
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:14,158
Look, Leon.

544
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,060
It's Holly's little friend.

545
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:19,163
Hey, knock it off or I'll...

546
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:20,998
Or you'll what?

547
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,666
Dittmeyer!

548
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:25,403
Do it and die.

549
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:33,878
I'm going to get you, Brady.

550
00:23:34,514 --> 00:23:37,415
A $20,000 advance?

551
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:38,682
I'd like to, Mike,

552
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:40,618
but we're still hurting
from the recession.

553
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,821
I only have three developers
coming all this week.

554
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:46,791
Let me have a shot
at those projects, Mr. Phillips.

555
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:48,859
If I can sell
one of them my design

556
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:51,128
you could front me
the advance, right?

557
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,063
Sure, but...

558
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:57,668
How should I put this
delicately, Mike?

559
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:01,839
Your designs
are from another time.

560
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:05,810
That's kind of you to say,
Mr. Phillips.

561
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:06,811
I've always thought

562
00:24:06,813 --> 00:24:09,480
of my style as "classic,"
as well.

563
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:11,549
I'll get right to work.

564
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:17,788
Well, Mr. Amir,
what do you think?

565
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,190
I love it.

566
00:24:19,192 --> 00:24:22,092
But it's too...

567
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:23,227
interesting.

568
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:24,695
I want something simple.

569
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,997
A couple of self-serve pump

570
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:29,633
and a Slurpee machine.

571
00:24:31,504 --> 00:24:32,937
Sorry.

572
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:37,074
It's only strike one,
Mr. Phillips.

573
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:39,910
I've still got
two more times at bat.

574
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,616
Cinderella,

575
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:47,151
dressed in yellow,

576
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:48,586
went to the ball

577
00:24:48,588 --> 00:24:49,720
to kiss the fellow.

578
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:52,590
Hey, Heidi, go yodel
in your own yard, huh?

579
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:54,992
Okay, Mr. Dittmeyer.

580
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:04,835
Whoa!

581
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:21,519
Hey!

582
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:23,762
Hey, little girl!

583
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:26,557
I got to get something

584
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,591
out of my truck.

585
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:29,059
Don't let anybody

586
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:30,895
touch this wire.

587
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:34,131
Can you do that? Of course.

588
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:41,839
Daddy, there's a Brady
in our yard!

589
00:25:44,911 --> 00:25:47,177
I thought I told you

590
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:47,945
to stay

591
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:48,612
in your own yard.

592
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:51,215
Yes. But you see, Mr. Dittmeyer,
I'm simply standing here...

593
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:53,083
You know, the lisp thing
is really getting old.

594
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:56,554
So why don't you hop back
on the Swiss Miss package

595
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:58,222
where you belong, huh?

596
00:25:58,224 --> 00:25:59,723
Okay.

597
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:00,591
Oh.

598
00:26:00,593 --> 00:26:03,827
Don't forget your jump rope.

599
00:26:05,932 --> 00:26:08,832
Ohh...

600
00:26:12,872 --> 00:26:15,139
Try it and you're Spam.

601
00:26:20,313 --> 00:26:22,079
Well, Mr. Brady,

602
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,315
did you hit a home run today?

603
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:29,920
My design didn't even
make it to first base.

604
00:26:36,696 --> 00:26:38,162
You know, maybe we should think

605
00:26:38,164 --> 00:26:40,898
about taking Mr. Dittmeyer
up on his offer.

606
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,068
You're serious
about selling the house?

607
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,236
Carol, I designed
this house myself...

608
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:47,371
every color, every brick,

609
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:48,339
every sheet of Formica.

610
00:26:48,341 --> 00:26:51,041
If I knew another
way out, I'd take it.

611
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:52,843
But where else are
we going to find

612
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:55,112
$20,000 by the end of the week?

613
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:55,980
Oh, no.

614
00:26:55,982 --> 00:26:59,750
We're going to have
to sell our house.

615
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:05,823
¶ Clowns never laughed before ¶

618
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:15,399
What is it, Cindy?

619
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:18,268
I'm busy writing
a song for Danielle.

620
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,372
I have to tell you something.

621
00:27:21,374 --> 00:27:22,406
Okay.

622
00:27:22,408 --> 00:27:23,374
But I can't tell you,

623
00:27:23,376 --> 00:27:25,342
'cause that would be tattling.

624
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:25,944
Come on, Cindy.

625
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:28,245
If it's important,
it's not tattling.

626
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:29,179
I'm never going to tell

627
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:32,082
that Mom and Dad
have to sell the house

628
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:33,751
because they owe

629
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:34,952
$20,000.

630
00:27:34,954 --> 00:27:37,121
Oops.

631
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:39,289
And that's why
I called this meeting.

632
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,424
Greg, what are we going to do?

633
00:27:40,426 --> 00:27:44,328
Yeah. If we don't raise
$20,000 in one week,

634
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,362
we'll have to move.

635
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:47,364
And go to a new school.

636
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:48,232
And make new friends.

637
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:51,168
But, Jan, you don't
have any friends.

638
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,303
Wait. We can save the house.

639
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:56,106
We can raise
the money ourselves.

640
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:56,774
But how?

641
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:59,043
Well, we can each get jobs
and earn extra money.

642
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:00,978
Hey, neato idea.

643
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,347
Gee, there are
so many things I'm good at.

644
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:04,348
I wouldn't know where to start.

645
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:08,852
Oh, I'm just so perfect
at so many things.

646
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,120
You're just jealous, Jan.

647
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:12,089
I'm going to make
some serious cash.

648
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:15,225
Oh, yeah? Well, I bet I
can make more than you.

649
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:16,326
With what, shrimpo?

650
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:17,461
Your tooth fairy money?

651
00:28:17,463 --> 00:28:19,430
Who are you calling "shrimpo"?

652
00:28:19,432 --> 00:28:20,264
Hey, Mom always said

653
00:28:20,266 --> 00:28:22,766
don't play ball in the house.

654
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,803
Hey, you guys, stop fighting!

655
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:28,372
If we're going to save this
house for Mom and Dad,

656
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:29,940
we've each got to make

657
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:31,742
as much as we can.

658
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:32,776
Yeah.

659
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:33,811
Yeah.

660
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:34,745
Yeah.

661
00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:36,113
Yeah.

662
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:45,956
<i>But, Jan, you don't</i>
<i>have any friends.</i>

663
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:48,859
<i>You're just jealous, Jan.</i>

664
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,272
Jan! What are you doing?

665
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:03,807
Go back to sleep, Cindy.

666
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:04,808
Jan, don't!

667
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:07,111
Marcia's hair is so beautiful.

668
00:29:07,113 --> 00:29:08,212
Exactly. That's why

669
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:11,348
I'm going to get a lot of money

670
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,484
when I sell it.

671
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:21,091
Jan,

672
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:23,127
what are you doing?

673
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:24,762
Oh, Marcia.

674
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:26,396
I love your hair.

675
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:28,899
Ooh! What a groovy hairdo.

676
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:31,068
Oh, you're so beautiful!

677
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,903
No! She's supposed

678
00:29:32,905 --> 00:29:34,004
to look bad.

679
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:36,440
No! Nooooo!

680
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:44,515
What a horrible dream.

681
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,423
Greg, have you gone bananas?

682
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:58,061
No. I just found
a way to save our house.

683
00:29:58,063 --> 00:30:00,364
I'm going
to become a rock star.

684
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:04,101
That's great, Greg,
but I need some advice

685
00:30:04,103 --> 00:30:06,136
about something
<i>really</i> important.

686
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,405
See, Charlie asked
me to the dance

687
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:09,007
and I said yes.

688
00:30:09,008 --> 00:30:12,376
Then<i> Doug</i> asked me,
and I said yes to him, too.

689
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:13,110
What am I going to do?

690
00:30:13,112 --> 00:30:17,147
Well, you just tell the guy
you don't want to go with

691
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,883
that something
suddenly came up.

692
00:30:19,885 --> 00:30:20,485
And that works?

693
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:25,489
Sure. Girls say it
to me all the time.

694
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:30,594
Hey, Marcia.

695
00:30:30,596 --> 00:30:31,495
Oh, hi, Charlie.

696
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:34,932
I can't wait until
the dance Friday night.

697
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:37,234
Oh. Um...

698
00:30:37,236 --> 00:30:39,403
about the dance, Charlie...

699
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:43,207
well, something
suddenly came up.

700
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:45,209
Oh.

701
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:48,011
Oh, well,
you know, that's okay.

702
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,980
Maybe some other time?

703
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:51,415
Sure.

704
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:52,950
Bye.

705
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:54,284
Bye.

706
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:56,987
Greg was right.

707
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:00,991
Well, that takes care
of that problem.

708
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,161
Let's see what's next.

709
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:08,232
Hmm.

better than that!

00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:04,769
of making something
of yourself?

730
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:11,628
"Clowns"?

731
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,496
"Beanstalks"?

732
00:32:12,498 --> 00:32:15,132
What the hell is this?

733
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:17,434
This is a guaranteed
gold record!

734
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:20,203
¶ Clowns never laughed before ¶

735
00:32:20,205 --> 00:32:22,272
¶ And beanstalks... ¶

736
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,407
No.

737
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:25,709
Look, what did you say

738
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:27,077
your name was again?

739
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:29,146
Bravo... Johnny Bravo.

740
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:30,180
Listen...

741
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:30,614
"Bravo..."

742
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:33,283
today's sound is raw,
with an edge.

743
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,552
Seattle... grunge...
garage bands...

744
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:39,056
Don't they have
beanstalks in Seattle?

745
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:44,494
Well, hey, there, groovy chick.

746
00:32:44,496 --> 00:32:47,030
Mmm... uh-uh.

747
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:48,265
Yeah. It went fabulous.

748
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:50,334
Put the head back on, Fletcher.

749
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:52,669
Listen, I am closing in
on the, uh...

750
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:54,204
on the Bradys, though.

751
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:56,373
Can I call you back,
Mr. Feldman?

752
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:58,275
My car phone's ringing.

753
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:00,610
Hello.

754
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:02,446
Hello. I'm calling
from a marketing firm.

755
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:06,083
We'd just like
a few minutes of your time...

756
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:06,766
Ow!

757
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,088
Do you ever use
pens and pencils?

758
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,723
I know you do...

759
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,759
Oh, hi, Mrs. Dittmeyer!

760
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:18,428
I'm here to see Eric.

761
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,496
Oh, hi, Greggie.

762
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,498
Oh, Greg...

763
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,532
I'm so glad you're here.

764
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:24,668
I've got some more
of your mail.

765
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,569
Oh.

766
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:28,171
Oh, gee, your hands are full.

767
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,140
Let me just...

768
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:33,677
My, you've...

769
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:34,311
gotten so big.

770
00:33:34,313 --> 00:33:36,780
You're almost as big
as your daddy.

771
00:33:36,782 --> 00:33:38,648
And I'm still growing.

772
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:42,019
Right... before my very eyes.

773
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:44,755
Your pants are... so tight.

774
00:33:44,757 --> 00:33:46,490
Hey, Mrs. Dittmeyer.

775
00:33:46,492 --> 00:33:47,157
Peter!

776
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:48,425
Can I mow your lawn?

777
00:33:48,427 --> 00:33:51,762
I'm trying to earn
some extra money.

778
00:33:51,764 --> 00:33:52,562
Sure.

779
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:54,698
Two Bradys...

780
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,500
Tell you what...
when you boys are done,

781
00:33:56,502 --> 00:34:01,071
why don't you come inside
and help me make a sandwich?

782
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:12,482
Penny for your thoughts.

783
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:14,618
How about 20,000 of them?

784
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,254
You're worried about
the house, aren't you?

785
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:20,557
I told you I'd take care
of everything.

786
00:34:21,627 --> 00:34:25,429
Oh, Mike, it's just that
we're so happy here.

787
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:27,798
I sure would miss our kitchen

788
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,366
and our garden...

789
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:30,367
and Alice!

790
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:30,767
If we lose her,

791
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:32,602
who'll make the
lunches I pass out?

792
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:34,104
And who'll answer the phone:

793
00:34:34,106 --> 00:34:36,206
"Brady residence."

794
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:36,773
And who'll help me...

795
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:41,178
Honey, Alice isn't going
anywhere, and neither are we.

796
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:46,616
Besides, she doesn't do
<i>everything</i> around her.

797
00:34:48,387 --> 00:34:52,789
Time to put your
bookmark in, Mr. Brady.

798
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:07,571
I sure am glad your mom
let you sleep over

799
00:35:07,573 --> 00:35:08,805
on a school night.

800
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:13,743
Marcia, I have to
tell you something.

801
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:14,311
Hmm?

802
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:20,317
You are the prettiest girl
in the entire school.

803
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:20,650
I know.

804
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:25,555
But how can I use my good looks
and sparkling personality

805
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:28,859
to make money
and save our house?

806
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:32,162
That's it!

807
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:35,665
I could be a teen model!

808
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,334
Oh, thanks, Noreen!

809
00:35:37,336 --> 00:35:39,636
You're the greatest!

810
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,538
Oh...

811
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:44,841
Noreen?

812
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:45,809
Hmm?

813
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:47,310
Is that you?

814
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:48,211
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.

815
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:50,714
I thought that was <i> my</i> leg.

816
00:35:50,716 --> 00:35:52,182
Oh...

817
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:53,517
Night.

818
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:56,153
Sweet dreams, Marcia.

819
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:04,194
I still don't know why
<i>you</i> had to tag along.

820
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:04,661
This is<i> my</i> thing.

821
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:10,167
You're not the only one
who can be a model, you know.

822
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:13,670
Ooh... those are
pretty pictures.

823
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:16,606
What have you modeled for?

824
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:18,241
Guess.

825
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:22,412
Um... are you a Breck girl?

826
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:23,680
No. "Guess" jeans.

827
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,615
Okay, um...

828
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:27,617
Levis... Wrangler...

829
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:29,786
Oshkosh B'Gosh?

830
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:30,954
Brady girls?

831
00:36:30,956 --> 00:36:32,255
That's us.

832
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:35,225
So... you're
professional models?

833
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:37,494
Yes, we are! Of course!

834
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:40,363
So, what do you
have to show me?

835
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,965
Plenty.

836
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:05,889
Oh...

837
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:08,258
Why don't we take five?

838
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,759
You.

839
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:12,395
Wow...

840
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:16,866
Thank you!

841
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:18,535
Why does everyone
always choose Marcia?!

842
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:20,437
What does she have
that I don't have?!

843
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:24,274
Now, Marcia, I may
be able to use you,

844
00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:26,876
but first, you're
going to have to do

845
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:27,978
a little work on yourself.

846
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,814
You mean like walking
with a book on my head?

847
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:33,350
No. I mean like
cutting that mousy hair,

848
00:37:33,352 --> 00:37:33,883
capping those teeth

849
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:36,987
and losing about 30 pounds,
my little sausage.

850
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:39,322
How do you feel about

851
00:37:39,324 --> 00:37:41,458
breast implants?

852
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,994
Cut my hair?!

853
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,368
And, after much
consideration, Mr. Swanson,

854
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:55,372
I designed a structure
especially for<i> your</i> needs.

855
00:37:55,374 --> 00:37:56,039
So, what do you think?

856
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:59,542
Well, it's just
too good a design

857
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:00,844
for a fast food joint.

858
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:02,746
You see what I'm saying,
Phillips?

859
00:38:02,748 --> 00:38:06,416
This is... I think you're
pumping a dry well here.

860
00:38:06,418 --> 00:38:08,852
You understand what I'm saying?

861
00:38:08,854 --> 00:38:09,386
All right.

862
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:10,720
I'll be in touch with you.

863
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,422
Sorry, Mikey.

864
00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:16,860
Well... strike two.

865
00:38:19,398 --> 00:38:24,768
There's got to be a way
to make $20,000.

866
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:26,736
Hey!

867
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:29,439
<i>"Search for the Stars</i>
is looking

868
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:31,541
"for fresh young musical acts.

869
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:34,978
First prize: $20,000."

870
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,812
Hmm...

871
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:38,815
Too bad I'm not a musical act.

872
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,884
Hey, Marcia!

873
00:38:40,886 --> 00:38:45,088
I'm not Marcia! I'm Jan!

874
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,523
The usual, Sam.

875
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:47,757
Sure thing, Mrs. Brady.

876
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:50,393
20 pounds of ground round
coming right up.

877
00:38:50,395 --> 00:38:52,062
Carol, are you still
eating red meat?

878
00:38:52,064 --> 00:38:54,464
Why, of course!
I've got growing kids!

879
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:56,966
I have to think
about their health!

880
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:58,568
Isn't Sam

881
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:58,935
the best?

882
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:01,771
We're sure going to miss
this place when we move,

883
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:02,405
won't we?

884
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:03,006
Oh, we're not moving.

885
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:05,675
You're not? I thought everyone
on the block was.

886
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:08,044
Mike says there's
no reason to sell.

887
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:09,512
We'll be here forever.

888
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:11,815
There you go, Mrs. Brady.

889
00:39:11,817 --> 00:39:14,551
Thanks, Sam.

890
00:39:14,553 --> 00:39:16,820
Have a nice day.

891
00:39:16,822 --> 00:39:18,421
Bye, Sam.

892
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:19,923
Bye.

893
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:27,564
Marcia, could you call
the troops to dinner?

894
00:39:27,566 --> 00:39:27,931
In a second.

895
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:31,601
I'm just checking
for a letter from Davy Jones.

896
00:39:31,603 --> 00:39:31,868
Nothing.

897
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:35,505
Oh, Alice, if I don't get
an answer from him soon,

898
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:38,675
I'll be the most humiliated girl
in the world.

899
00:39:38,677 --> 00:39:42,779
You think waiting three weeks
for an answer is rough?

900
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:46,149
Try waiting 20 years
for the question.

901
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:49,052
Alice.

902
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:51,988
Hey, Greg, you're the
Casanova of Clinton Avenue.

903
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,623
How can I get Holly
to go for me?

904
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:56,025
Well, chicks
love compliments, man.

905
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:58,027
Just tell her
how groovy she is.

906
00:39:58,029 --> 00:39:58,962
And that really works?

907
00:39:58,964 --> 00:40:01,064
Trust me. It always
gets a reaction.

908
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:02,932
Now, throw me a pass.

909
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:06,770
24, 32, set, hike.

910
00:40:08,774 --> 00:40:11,608
Dinner's ready... Ooh, my nose!

911
00:40:12,811 --> 00:40:13,877
Are you all right?

912
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:16,413
Oh, gee, I'm sorry, Marcia.

913
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:16,946
Yeah, me, too.

914
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:20,550
Let's have a look, Marcia.

915
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:25,422
I look awful, just awful.

916
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:30,059
I can never show my face
in school again.

917
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:30,827
I'm ruined.

918
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:33,963
Sweetheart, I know
you feel terrible,

919
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:36,599
but it's going to get better.

920
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:39,769
I'm sure no one
will ever notice.

921
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,037
Oh, my goodness.

922
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:43,807
What happened to your...?

923
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,477
Mother's favorite picture?

924
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:48,111
It's crooked.

925
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:50,180
I mean the painting's crooked.

926
00:40:50,182 --> 00:40:52,582
I think I'd better go.

927
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:54,150
I think I hear the nose boy.

928
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:55,218
I mean the newsboy.

929
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:58,721
Oh, boy, did I blow it.

930
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:02,225
Now I'll never be a teen model.

931
00:41:02,227 --> 00:41:03,726
I'll never be anything.

932
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:05,795
What's the point of living?

933
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,831
I might as well die.

934
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,671
Don't forget my
$10 reward money.

935
00:41:14,673 --> 00:41:17,474
I made more than
you... almost $12.

936
00:41:17,476 --> 00:41:20,577
Well, I got $15
from Mrs. Dittmeyer.

937
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:22,479
Boy, is she a good tipper.

938
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:25,982
But we're still
nowhere near $20,000.

939
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,817
This is just awful.

940
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,185
You can say that again.

941
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:30,854
Tonight's the school dance

942
00:41:30,856 --> 00:41:34,224
and my nose
still hasn't gone down.

943
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:36,092
Hey, I saw something

944
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:38,595
on the bulletin board at school

945
00:41:38,597 --> 00:41:41,130
about a "Search
for the Stars" contest.

946
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:43,233
They're looking for fresh,

947
00:41:43,235 --> 00:41:44,767
young musical groups.

948
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:46,836
First prize is exactly $20,000.

949
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:49,539
Oh, sure, Jan,
like we'd really win.

950
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:49,873
Oh, Jan...

951
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:51,508
We'd never have
a chance of winning.

952
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,141
We might as well rob a bank.

953
00:41:52,143 --> 00:41:53,510
Guys, there's no point
in fighting.

954
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:55,845
We're running out of time,
and we still have to find

955
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,213
a way out of this mess.

956
00:41:57,215 --> 00:42:00,650
I sure am going
to miss this house.

957
00:42:00,652 --> 00:42:01,251
Uh-oh.

958
00:42:01,253 --> 00:42:02,919
Here comes Mom and Dad.

959
00:42:02,921 --> 00:42:05,588
All right, now,
remember, everyone, act happy.

960
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,523
We can't let on

961
00:42:06,525 --> 00:42:07,924
that we know anything.

962
00:42:10,729 --> 00:42:16,633
Mike, you don't think the kids
suspect anything, do you?

963
00:42:16,635 --> 00:42:17,967
Oh, no, of course not.

964
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:22,839
Well, just to make sure,
we should act extra happy.

965
00:42:22,841 --> 00:42:27,210
Well, you know
what makes us the happiest.

966
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:29,012
Potato sack race!

967
00:42:29,014 --> 00:42:30,680
Get ready...

968
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:31,848
get set...

969
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,130
go!

970
00:42:35,687 --> 00:42:37,186
So, what can I do you for?

971
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:38,154
You can explain to me

972
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:40,089
what Mrs. Brady told my wife.

973
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:42,592
Yeah, if Mike Brady won't sell,

974
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:44,294
we're all screwed.

975
00:42:44,296 --> 00:42:46,863
Well, allow me
to take this opportunity

976
00:42:46,865 --> 00:42:47,897
to set the record straight.

977
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,733
The Bradys are selling,
my clients are buying

978
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:52,936
and you are all making out
like bandits.

979
00:42:52,938 --> 00:42:56,039
Scotch, Steve? Are you
calling my wife a liar?

980
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:56,673
Steve, no.

981
00:42:56,675 --> 00:42:59,008
I'm just saying
you can't believe the Bradys.

982
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:03,012
You've all seen the insane stuff
that goes on over there.

983
00:43:03,014 --> 00:43:05,214
How about this Astroturf lawn

984
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:07,884
they treat like
real grass, huh?

985
00:43:07,886 --> 00:43:08,751
And, excuse me...

986
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:12,221
the family that's happy
<i>all</i> the time?

987
00:43:12,223 --> 00:43:12,889
Not possible.

988
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:16,659
It<i> is</i> strange how they
spend their weekends...

989
00:43:16,661 --> 00:43:18,895
hopping around in potato sacks.

990
00:43:18,897 --> 00:43:20,296
And you know something? Yeah.

991
00:43:20,298 --> 00:43:23,299
I hear that their maid
works for free.

992
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:25,335
Can you understand that?

993
00:43:25,337 --> 00:43:26,235
No. I can't. No.

994
00:43:26,237 --> 00:43:28,171
You know,
I was over there once.

995
00:43:28,173 --> 00:43:30,073
One bathroom for nine people?

996
00:43:30,075 --> 00:43:31,674
Get out of here.
Oh, stop, please.

997
00:43:31,676 --> 00:43:33,376
And I never did see a toilet.

998
00:43:33,378 --> 00:43:37,080
Please, they've got
to put it somewhere.

999
00:43:37,082 --> 00:43:38,081
Come on.

1000
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:40,016
I rest my case.

1001
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:44,253
Hi. I'm Doug Simpson.

1002
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,221
Marcia's date?

1003
00:43:45,223 --> 00:43:48,324
Oh, right...
the big man on campus.

1004
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:49,392
Come on in, Doug.

1005
00:43:49,394 --> 00:43:51,995
Marcia, Doug's here!

1006
00:43:52,998 --> 00:43:54,364
Hi, Doug.

1007
00:43:54,366 --> 00:43:57,667
Big man on campus, huh?

1008
00:43:57,669 --> 00:43:59,936
Yeah, right.

1009
00:44:03,742 --> 00:44:05,041
Hi, Doug.

1010
00:44:05,043 --> 00:44:06,275
Hi, Marcia.

1011
00:44:06,277 --> 00:44:08,111
Is anything wrong?

1012
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,181
Sweetheart, I think
you better show him.

1013
00:44:18,657 --> 00:44:22,158
I suppose you don't want
to go out with me now, huh?

1014
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,259
Oh, of course I do.

1015
00:44:23,261 --> 00:44:25,962
It's not your nose I'm after.

1016
00:44:27,732 --> 00:44:29,365
That's a fine boy.

1017
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:31,034
Marcia's got there.

1018
00:44:31,036 --> 00:44:33,002
Oh, Marcia, it looks like rain.

1019
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:35,271
You better take your shawl.

1020
00:44:35,273 --> 00:44:36,205
Thanks.

1021
00:44:36,207 --> 00:44:37,674
Uh, Doug, how about you?

1022
00:44:37,676 --> 00:44:40,143
Do you have any protection?

1023
00:44:40,145 --> 00:44:40,977
Oh, yes, ma'am.

1024
00:44:40,979 --> 00:44:43,279
Assorted colors and textures.

1025
00:44:43,281 --> 00:44:44,380
Good for you.

1026
00:44:44,382 --> 00:44:46,783
Have fun, kids.

1027
00:44:46,785 --> 00:44:47,984
Bye-bye.

1028
00:44:47,986 --> 00:44:52,055
¶ Are you coming with me? ¶

1029
00:44:53,091 --> 00:44:55,425
But, Doug, this isn't
the school dance.

1030
00:44:55,427 --> 00:44:59,729
I just figured we'd come up
here and unwind a little bit

1031
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:00,730
before we go down.

1032
00:45:00,732 --> 00:45:03,399
Mind if I change the station?

1033
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:08,871
Oh, it is windy tonight.

1034
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:11,340
Maybe we should put the top up.

1035
00:45:11,342 --> 00:45:14,010
I'll keep you warm, Marcia.

1036
00:45:14,012 --> 00:45:14,811
Uh...

1037
00:45:14,813 --> 00:45:17,847
Doug, your hand
is on my shoulder.

1038
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:18,047
So?

1039
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:23,186
Well, that's third base,
and I don't go that far.

1040
00:45:23,788 --> 00:45:27,190
Doug, I think I just felt
your tongue in my mouth.

1041
00:45:27,192 --> 00:45:29,058
That's called
a French kiss, Marcia.

1042
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,428
I thought you were
from Nebraska.

1043
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:32,862
I am.

1044
00:45:32,864 --> 00:45:35,765
Listen, Doug, I don't know
what you were thinking,

1045
00:45:35,767 --> 00:45:37,500
but I don't do things
like that.

1046
00:45:37,502 --> 00:45:39,135
You may live your life one way,

1047
00:45:39,137 --> 00:45:41,471
but we Bradys
follow our own drummer.

1048
00:45:41,473 --> 00:45:46,142
So, I hope this doesn't sour
the rest of our date.

1049
00:45:47,812 --> 00:45:50,813
You Bradys suck!

1050
00:45:57,789 --> 00:45:58,788
Excuse me.

1051
00:45:58,790 --> 00:45:59,388
Oh, no, thank you.

1052
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:02,091
I don't take rides
from strangers.

1053
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:03,226
I was just wondering

1054
00:46:03,228 --> 00:46:05,995
how to get
to West Dale High School.

1055
00:46:05,997 --> 00:46:07,430
West Dale High?

1056
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:09,532
¶ How do you do? ¶

1057
00:46:09,534 --> 00:46:10,466
¶ Yeah ¶

1058
00:46:20,779 --> 00:46:22,545
¶ So now I'm pissed off ¶

1059
00:46:22,547 --> 00:46:24,514
¶ My head is a twist-off ¶

1060
00:46:24,516 --> 00:46:25,915
¶ I never have been cute ¶

1061
00:46:25,917 --> 00:46:29,485
¶ I need more money
'cause my life is crummy ¶

1062
00:46:29,487 --> 00:46:31,921
¶ And get that stuff
off my shoe ¶

1063
00:46:31,923 --> 00:46:36,325
¶ It is a cruel world,
I'm no schoolgirl ¶

1064
00:46:36,327 --> 00:46:37,560
¶ I never do what I should ¶

1065
00:46:37,562 --> 00:46:41,063
¶ And they never know,
it's about to blow... ¶

1066
00:46:41,065 --> 00:46:42,365
Hey, you're one groovy chick.

1067
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:45,468
You're really happening
in a far-out way.

1068
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:47,970
Thanks.

1069
00:47:07,192 --> 00:47:09,225
Peter!

1070
00:47:19,103 --> 00:47:19,943
Yeah!

1071
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:29,445
Excuse me.

1072
00:47:29,447 --> 00:47:31,414
Can I have your attention,
please?

1073
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:34,083
You may all know me
as Greg Brady,

1074
00:47:34,085 --> 00:47:37,553
but tonight,
I'd like to introduce you to...

1075
00:47:37,555 --> 00:47:40,056
Johnny Bravo!

1076
00:47:44,629 --> 00:47:45,328
For my first song,

1077
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:47,196
I'd like to sing
a number I wrote

1078
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:50,199
for the grooviest chick
at West Dale High.

1079
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:52,635
One, two

1080
00:47:52,637 --> 00:47:54,370
three, four...

1081
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:58,207
¶ Clowns never laughed before ¶

1082
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:01,544
¶ Beanstalks never grew ¶

1083
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:05,014
¶ Ponies never ran before ¶

1084
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:17,593
Ah-ha-ha-ha!

1085
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:23,165
¶ Does it scare you ¶

1086
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:25,087
¶ When you see me
lose my mind... ¶

1087
00:48:25,904 --> 00:48:27,003
¶ I go crazy... ¶

1088
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:28,137
Hi, everybody.

1089
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:30,339
It's the new Jan Brady.

1090
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:33,309
Am I a hit?

1091
00:48:33,311 --> 00:48:34,944
Do you like it?

1092
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,017
Hmm.

1093
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:43,052
Wow. It worked.

1094
00:48:43,054 --> 00:48:46,188
I really<i> did</i> make a splash.

1095
00:48:46,357 --> 00:48:49,058
Can I have your attention,
please?

1096
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:49,492
I have some news

1097
00:48:49,494 --> 00:48:51,961
that's going to make
everyone flip.

1098
00:48:51,963 --> 00:48:53,529
Hey... what about me?

1099
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:54,630
I thought he might show up,

1100
00:48:54,632 --> 00:48:57,500
but I didn't want
to get all your hopes up.

1101
00:48:57,502 --> 00:48:59,669
Marcia did it again.

1102
00:48:59,671 --> 00:49:02,271
Marcia, Marcia, Marcia!

1103
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,407
But here he is...

1104
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:05,541
Davy Jones!

1105
00:49:07,545 --> 00:49:08,945
Hey, Grandpa...

1106
00:49:08,947 --> 00:49:09,445
Oh, man!

1107
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:12,281
Thanks a lot for
being here, Davy...

1108
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:13,716
I mean, Mr. Jones.

1109
00:49:13,718 --> 00:49:16,686
Anything for my number-one fan.

1110
00:49:28,533 --> 00:49:30,132
¶ Girl ¶

1111
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:33,102
¶ Look what you've done to me ¶

1112
00:49:33,104 --> 00:49:35,571
Look, it really is Davy Jones!

1113
00:49:35,573 --> 00:49:37,173
¶ Me ¶

1114
00:49:37,575 --> 00:49:40,343
¶ And my whole world ¶

1115
00:49:43,181 --> 00:49:44,714
¶ Girl ¶

1116
00:49:44,716 --> 00:49:46,048
¶ You've brought ¶

1117
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:49,185
¶ The sun to me ¶

1118
00:49:49,187 --> 00:49:52,521
¶ With your smile ¶

1119
00:49:52,523 --> 00:49:54,623
¶ You did it, girl ¶

1120
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:59,462
¶ I'm telling you, girl ¶

1121
00:49:59,464 --> 00:50:00,763
¶ Something not ¶

1122
00:50:00,765 --> 00:50:03,566
¶ Known to me ¶

1123
00:50:04,369 --> 00:50:05,735
¶ Makes ¶

1124
00:50:05,737 --> 00:50:08,137
¶ You what you are... ¶

1125
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:09,438
Hi, Charlie.

1126
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,172
Hey, Marcia.

1127
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:12,475
It was rude of me
to break our date.

1128
00:50:12,477 --> 00:50:14,477
How can I make it up to you?

1129
00:50:14,479 --> 00:50:18,314
Well, uh... gee, Marcia,
how about a dance?

1130
00:50:18,316 --> 00:50:21,517
Why, I'd love to,
Charlie Anderson.

1131
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:25,087
¶ ...that way, girl ¶

1132
00:50:25,089 --> 00:50:26,222
¶ Thank you, girl ¶

1133
00:50:26,224 --> 00:50:29,625
¶ For making
the morning brighter ¶

1134
00:50:29,627 --> 00:50:30,226
¶ Girl ¶

1135
00:50:30,228 --> 00:50:33,262
¶ For making
the nighttime nicer ¶

1136
00:50:33,264 --> 00:50:33,662
¶ Girl ¶

1137
00:50:33,664 --> 00:50:36,465
¶ For making a better world ¶

1138
00:50:36,467 --> 00:50:38,701
¶ For me ¶

1139
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:42,138
¶ I'm telling you, girl ¶

1140
00:50:42,507 --> 00:50:46,342
¶ Something unknown to me ¶

1141
00:50:47,645 --> 00:50:49,311
¶ Makes ¶

1142
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:53,382
¶ You what you are ¶

1143
00:50:53,751 --> 00:50:56,452
¶ And what you are ¶

1144
00:50:56,454 --> 00:51:00,456
¶ Is all that I want for me ¶

1145
00:51:01,259 --> 00:51:02,491
¶ And it's good ¶

1146
00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:07,730
¶ To feel that way, girl ¶

1147
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:09,098
¶ Thank you, girl ¶

1148
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:12,802
¶ For making the winter warmer ¶

1149
00:51:12,804 --> 00:51:13,436
¶ Girl ¶

1150
00:51:13,438 --> 00:51:16,672
¶ For making the music softer ¶

1151
00:51:16,674 --> 00:51:17,306
¶ Girl ¶

1152
00:51:17,308 --> 00:51:21,243
¶ For making a better world
for me ¶

1153
00:51:34,358 --> 00:51:37,726
¶ And what you are ¶

1154
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:42,832
¶ Is all that I want for me ¶

1155
00:51:42,834 --> 00:51:44,533
¶ And it's good ¶

1156
00:51:44,535 --> 00:51:47,703
¶ To feel that way, girl ¶

1157
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:52,341
¶ Thank you, girl ¶

1158
00:51:54,112 --> 00:51:56,645
¶ Thank you, girl ¶

1159
00:51:57,181 --> 00:52:01,150
¶ Thank you, girl... ¶

1160
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,200
Hey, where are you going?

1161
00:52:18,202 --> 00:52:21,303
Something suddenly came up.

1162
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,641
Hey, Marcia,
you looked great up there.

1163
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:27,610
Thanks, Noreen.

1164
00:52:28,446 --> 00:52:31,213
Hey, Marcia, you got a sec?

1165
00:52:31,215 --> 00:52:32,548
Forget it, Doug.

1166
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:33,916
Even with a swollen nose,

1167
00:52:33,918 --> 00:52:36,285
I can still smell a rat.

1168
00:52:41,259 --> 00:52:42,625
Slut.

1169
00:52:46,597 --> 00:52:49,398
Um... Marcia, would
you get our coats.

1170
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:53,169
I have a little, uh...
matter to discuss.

1171
00:52:53,704 --> 00:52:55,437
Sure, Charlie.

1172
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:57,273
Hey...

1173
00:52:57,275 --> 00:52:58,340
I heard what you said, Doug...

1174
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:02,478
and I'm not going to let you
talk to Marcia like that.

1175
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,179
Yeah?

1176
00:53:03,181 --> 00:53:04,947
Yeah. Well, what are you going

1177
00:53:04,949 --> 00:53:06,248
to do about it, geek?

1178
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:09,485
I-I'm going to... lose...

1179
00:53:10,188 --> 00:53:12,555
consciousness. Hey, Doug.

1180
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:14,356
How's about

1181
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:16,325
a little punch?

1182
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:22,431
Is he dead?

1183
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:27,469
Wow.

1184
00:53:27,471 --> 00:53:30,539
Charlie, thanks.

1185
00:53:35,346 --> 00:53:38,581
Couldn't have
done it better myself.

1186
00:53:44,822 --> 00:53:46,488
Here.

1187
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:54,496
Are you okay?

1188
00:54:00,238 --> 00:54:03,005
I really had
a great time, Marcia.

1189
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:05,407
Yeah, me, too, Charlie.

1190
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:08,010
Well, uh...

1191
00:54:08,012 --> 00:54:10,579
Bye. Bye.

1192
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:12,481
Uh, Marcia?

1193
00:54:12,483 --> 00:54:15,484
So, um... can, uh...

1194
00:54:15,486 --> 00:54:18,587
can I have a kiss good night?

1195
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:19,989
Yeah.

1196
00:54:19,991 --> 00:54:22,024
Okay, Charlie.

1197
00:54:28,499 --> 00:54:29,265
Marcia...

1198
00:54:29,267 --> 00:54:32,301
I think I just felt
your tongue in my mouth.

1199
00:54:32,303 --> 00:54:34,837
It's called a French kiss,
Charlie.

1200
00:54:34,839 --> 00:54:36,939
Um... Marcia, I got to go.

1201
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:40,809
Uh, something suddenly came up.

1202
00:54:57,595 --> 00:54:59,728
<i>32, 24, hike.</i>

1203
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:01,597
Dinner's ready.

1204
00:55:03,067 --> 00:55:05,401
Oh, my nose!

1205
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:12,408
What a nice dream.

1206
00:55:13,678 --> 00:55:15,978
Jan, what is it?

1207
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,713
Has my nose gotten worse?

1208
00:55:17,715 --> 00:55:20,716
No. It's better.

1209
00:55:28,526 --> 00:55:31,760
The hardest thing
about the health club business

1210
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:34,530
is getting people
to leave their house.

1211
00:55:34,532 --> 00:55:37,666
Well... what do you think?

1212
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:38,600
I love it.

1213
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:44,873
Consider yourself hired.

1214
00:55:56,921 --> 00:55:57,920
Uh-huh.

1215
00:55:57,922 --> 00:55:59,855
You would?

1216
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:01,690
I see.

1217
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:03,359
Ahh.

1218
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:05,594
All right.

1219
00:56:13,137 --> 00:56:15,037
Mom, Dad?

1220
00:56:24,582 --> 00:56:26,715
Hey, why the gloom?

1221
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:28,784
Well, we just had a kid meeting

1222
00:56:28,786 --> 00:56:29,718
and, well, we decided

1223
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,921
that we don't mind
if we have to move.

1224
00:56:32,923 --> 00:56:33,423
We tried

1225
00:56:33,424 --> 00:56:36,492
to raise the money for
the tax bill ourselves,

1226
00:56:36,494 --> 00:56:38,127
but there are only
two days left

1227
00:56:38,129 --> 00:56:41,630
and all we could come
up with was $110.

1228
00:56:41,632 --> 00:56:42,564
What?

1229
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:44,533
How did you know
about the house

1230
00:56:44,535 --> 00:56:46,068
and the tax bill?

1231
00:56:48,773 --> 00:56:49,505
Oops!

1232
00:56:49,507 --> 00:56:50,973
Cindy, do I have to remind you

1233
00:56:50,975 --> 00:56:51,940
that when you tattle
on somebody,

1234
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:56,145
you're not just telling on them,
you're telling on yourself

1235
00:56:56,147 --> 00:56:56,779
and...

1236
00:56:56,781 --> 00:56:59,882
Telling them
that you're a tattletale.

1237
00:56:59,884 --> 00:57:01,183
We've heard it, Dad. Thanks.

1238
00:57:01,185 --> 00:57:04,953
Kids, you have nothing
to worry about.

1239
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:07,423
Today your father sold a design

1240
00:57:07,425 --> 00:57:11,493
and now he can get
that $20,000 advance.

1241
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:14,630
I appreciate
what you all tried to do

1242
00:57:14,632 --> 00:57:16,698
and from now on,
no more secrets.

1243
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:18,667
The important thing is

1244
00:57:18,669 --> 00:57:19,735
we still have our home

1245
00:57:19,737 --> 00:57:20,903
so, let's celebrate.

1246
00:57:20,905 --> 00:57:22,971
Put on your Sunday best, kids.

1247
00:57:22,973 --> 00:57:24,473
We're going to Sears.

1248
00:57:30,915 --> 00:57:34,650
¶ I think I'll go for a walk
outside now ¶

1249
00:57:34,652 --> 00:57:37,519
¶ The summer sun's
calling my name ¶

1250
00:57:37,521 --> 00:57:38,053
¶<i> I hear ya now</i> ¶

1251
00:57:38,055 --> 00:57:41,623
¶<i> I just can't stay inside</i>
<i>all day</i> ¶

1252
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:46,695
¶<i> I gotta get out,</i>
<i>get me some of those rays</i> ¶

1253
00:57:46,697 --> 00:57:48,730
¶<i> Everybody's smilin'</i> ¶

1254
00:57:48,732 --> 00:57:49,932
¶<i> Sunshine day</i> ¶

1255
00:57:49,934 --> 00:57:55,003
¶<i> Everybody</i>
<i>seems so happy today</i> ¶

1256
00:57:55,005 --> 00:57:56,104
¶<i> It's a sunshine day</i> ¶

1257
00:57:56,106 --> 00:57:59,842
¶ I think I'll go for a walk
outside now ¶

1258
00:57:59,844 --> 00:58:02,578
¶ The summer sun
knows me by name ¶

1259
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:03,645
¶<i> He's a-calling me...</i> ¶

1260
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:07,249
Hey, everybody, look at Alice.

1261
00:58:11,021 --> 00:58:12,254
Outtasight.

1262
00:58:12,256 --> 00:58:12,921
Neato.

1263
00:58:12,923 --> 00:58:15,891
And I thought
Sam had magic fingers.

1264
00:58:17,061 --> 00:58:19,761
Oh, Alice.

1265
00:58:24,869 --> 00:58:25,901
Hey, everybody, look.

1266
00:58:25,903 --> 00:58:27,035
Come on, gang,
let's have a look.

1267
00:58:27,037 --> 00:58:29,872
¶ I think I'll take
a walk every day now ¶

1268
00:58:29,874 --> 00:58:31,874
I'm on TV.

1269
00:58:31,876 --> 00:58:34,276
¶ The summer sun's
shown me the way ¶

1270
00:58:34,278 --> 00:58:35,043
¶<i> To be happy now</i> ¶

1271
00:58:35,045 --> 00:58:38,013
¶<i> I just can't stay inside</i>

1272
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:43,051
¶<i> I gotta get out,</i>

1273
00:58:43,053 --> 00:58:44,219
Oh, my God...

1274
00:58:44,221 --> 00:58:45,754
Tori Spelling is here

1275
00:58:45,756 --> 00:58:48,156
autographing her new perfume!

1276
00:58:57,968 --> 00:59:01,570
¶<i> I think I'll go for a walk</i>
<i>outside now</i> ¶

1277
00:59:01,572 --> 00:59:04,773
¶<i> The summer sun's</i>

1278
00:59:04,775 --> 00:59:05,674

00:59:09,213 --> 00:59:12,014

1283
00:59:15,653 --> 00:59:17,119
<i>Bill.</i>

1284
00:59:17,121 --> 00:59:18,654
Brady.

1285
00:59:18,656 --> 00:59:20,222
Occupant.

1286
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:21,757
Bill.

1287
00:59:21,759 --> 00:59:23,058
Brady...

1288
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:27,229
"Joint consolidated tax bill:
Final notice."

1289
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:31,667
"Dear Mr. Brady...

1290
00:59:31,669 --> 00:59:33,302
"due to your failure to pay...

1291
00:59:33,304 --> 00:59:39,875
house will be auctioned
2:00 p.m. tomorrow..."

1292
00:59:39,877 --> 00:59:42,878
$20,000.

1293
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,246
Dina?

1294
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:45,847
Dina...

1295
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:49,851
this is the greatest
day of our lives.

1296
00:59:49,853 --> 00:59:51,920
Did the kids run away?

1297
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:53,055
No. We are rich.

1298
00:59:53,057 --> 00:59:59,061
We are going to be filthy,
stinking, disgustingly<i> rich.</i>

1299
00:59:59,063 --> 01:00:00,062
Larry?

1300
01:00:00,064 --> 01:00:00,829
Yeah?

1301
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:03,799
Get me my ice mask.

1302
01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:05,267
Forget your ice mask.

1303
01:00:05,269 --> 01:00:06,335
We're going to be so rich

1304
01:00:06,337 --> 01:00:09,771
you can hire an Eskimo
to sit on your face.

1305
01:00:18,082 --> 01:00:19,247
It's open.

1306
01:00:19,249 --> 01:00:21,083
Of course it is.

1307
01:00:22,386 --> 01:00:23,285
Morning.

1308
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:24,620
Morning, Larry.

1309
01:00:24,622 --> 01:00:25,087
If you're here

1310
01:00:25,089 --> 01:00:27,856
about the offer,
the answer's still no.

1311
01:00:27,858 --> 01:00:30,025
I haven't changed my mind.

1312
01:00:30,027 --> 01:00:30,726
No need for that.

1313
01:00:30,728 --> 01:00:32,628
I know
you won't be selling this house

1314
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:35,831
because, after the auction
tomorrow at 2:00, I'll own it.

1315
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:39,267
Well, I don't think
there'll be any auction.

1316
01:00:40,671 --> 01:00:41,203
What?

1317
01:00:41,205 --> 01:00:43,005
Well, luckily,
I just sold one of my designs,

1318
01:00:43,007 --> 01:00:47,142
so it looks like
the Bradys are here to stay.

1319
01:00:48,679 --> 01:00:50,879
So, which firm was lucky enough

1320
01:00:50,881 --> 01:00:53,815
to snag one of your designs,
Mike?

1321
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:55,217
<i>And, of course</i>

1322
01:00:55,219 --> 01:00:56,184
if you ever need a property

1323
01:00:56,186 --> 01:00:57,786
for one of your health clubs

1324
01:00:57,788 --> 01:00:58,854
I'm your man.

1325
01:00:58,856 --> 01:01:00,389
Oh, thank you.

1326
01:01:00,858 --> 01:01:03,258
Well, well. What have we here?

1327
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,826
This is one of our new gyms

1328
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:05,794
that we're constructing.

1329
01:01:05,796 --> 01:01:08,830
We are negotiating to buy
the design right now.

1330
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:10,832
Really? Who's your architect?

1331
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:13,035
A very talented fellow...

1332
01:01:13,037 --> 01:01:14,403
name of Brady.

1333
01:01:14,405 --> 01:01:17,439
I guess you won't be breaking
ground until after he dries out.

1334
01:01:17,441 --> 01:01:18,006
Dries out?

1335
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:19,107
I really shouldn't
say anything.

1336
01:01:19,109 --> 01:01:20,042
Guy's been
through a lot lately,

1337
01:01:20,044 --> 01:01:23,879
what with the charges filed
against him and everything.

1338
01:01:23,881 --> 01:01:24,846
Charges?

1339
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:25,714
Criminal negligence.

1340
01:01:25,716 --> 01:01:28,884
A building he designed
completely collapsed.

1341
01:01:28,886 --> 01:01:31,453
Old folks home, Christmas day.

1342
01:01:31,455 --> 01:01:35,791
All those cute, little
visiting grandchildren...

1343
01:01:35,793 --> 01:01:36,291
some with puppies.

1344
01:01:36,293 --> 01:01:41,963
Let's take a moment
to honor their memory, shall we?

1345
01:01:54,144 --> 01:01:55,844
I'll get it.

1346
01:01:57,081 --> 01:01:59,347
Brady residence.

1347
01:01:59,349 --> 01:02:00,816
You did? I see.

1348
01:02:00,818 --> 01:02:01,917
When?

1349
01:02:01,919 --> 01:02:03,285
Uh-huh.

1350
01:02:03,287 --> 01:02:04,953
They did?

1351
01:02:05,155 --> 01:02:06,788
Why not?

1352
01:02:07,191 --> 01:02:10,092
Uh-huh... oh.

1353
01:02:10,094 --> 01:02:12,327
Yeah?

1354
01:02:12,329 --> 01:02:13,061
Right.

1355
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:15,263
Well...

1356
01:02:15,265 --> 01:02:17,232
bye.

1357
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:18,800
Bad news, I'm afraid.

1358
01:02:18,802 --> 01:02:19,367
Oh, Mike. What?

1359
01:02:19,369 --> 01:02:22,204
The Flex factory pulled out
of the project this morning.

1360
01:02:22,206 --> 01:02:24,740
They're not going
with my design.

1361
01:02:24,742 --> 01:02:27,042
Oh, Mike. Why?

1362
01:02:27,044 --> 01:02:28,276
Well, they wouldn't say.

1363
01:02:28,278 --> 01:02:30,145
I guess this means it's over.

1364
01:02:30,147 --> 01:02:32,881
Unless a miracle happens
by 2:00 tomorrow,

1365
01:02:32,883 --> 01:02:36,118
the county is going
to auction our house.

1366
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,086
Oh, Mike. How?

1367
01:02:38,856 --> 01:02:40,088
Kids, I'm afraid the money

1368
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:43,859
that we were counting on
is no longer a possibility.

1369
01:02:43,861 --> 01:02:45,794
But I want you to remember

1370
01:02:45,796 --> 01:02:47,462
that no matter where we go,

1371
01:02:47,464 --> 01:02:49,164
or whatever house we're in,

1372
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:52,167
we'll be fine as long
as we're together,

1373
01:02:52,169 --> 01:02:55,771
so I don't want to see
any more frowns.

1374
01:02:55,773 --> 01:02:56,972
We're Bradys.

1375
01:02:56,974 --> 01:02:58,807
And as a wise man once said:

1376
01:02:58,809 --> 01:03:02,210
"Wherever you go,
there you are."

1377
01:03:02,379 --> 01:03:05,180
I never thought of it
that way, Dad.

1378
01:03:05,182 --> 01:03:08,150
Thanks, Dad.

1379
01:03:16,527 --> 01:03:18,994
Boy, this is crummy.

1380
01:03:18,996 --> 01:03:22,798
Well, there must be
some way out of this mess.

1381
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,533
Everybody think.

1382
01:03:31,508 --> 01:03:32,440
Hey, I've got it.

1383
01:03:32,442 --> 01:03:36,478
We can enter that
"Search for the Stars" contest.

1384
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,379
First prize

1385
01:03:37,381 --> 01:03:39,047
is exactly $20,000.

1386
01:03:39,049 --> 01:03:41,183
Hey, that's a nifty idea,
Marcia.

1387
01:03:41,819 --> 01:03:42,918
Great idea, Marcia.

1388
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:43,985
Good idea, Marcia.

1389
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:44,886
Am I invisible?

1390
01:03:44,888 --> 01:03:46,555
Do I not have a voice?

1391
01:03:46,557 --> 01:03:48,423
I had that idea two days ago.

1392
01:03:48,425 --> 01:03:50,425
Stop being so selfish, Jan.

1393
01:03:50,427 --> 01:03:51,493
Come on, Jan.

1394
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:52,961
Oh, Jan.

1395
01:03:52,963 --> 01:03:53,528
Jan. Jan.

1396
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:55,430
Come on, you guys, we got

1397
01:03:55,432 --> 01:03:56,164
a big day ahead of us.

1398
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:58,567
We better get some rest
if we're going to be

1399
01:03:58,569 --> 01:04:01,069
a fresh, young musical group.

1400
01:04:01,071 --> 01:04:02,604
It was my idea. Mine.

1401
01:04:02,606 --> 01:04:04,439
Didn't anybody hear me?

1402
01:04:04,441 --> 01:04:06,842
<i>I</i> heard you.

1403
01:04:06,844 --> 01:04:07,509
<i>Me, too,</i>

1404
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:11,079
<i>but it sounded better</i>
<i>coming from Marcia.</i>

1405
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:22,424
Sam, that was the juiciest
Meat Cutters' Ball

1406
01:04:22,426 --> 01:04:23,592
I've ever been to.

1407
01:04:23,594 --> 01:04:24,359
I'm cooked.

1408
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:27,495
Alice, I want you to
stick out your hand

1409
01:04:27,497 --> 01:04:28,496
and close your eyes.

1410
01:04:28,498 --> 01:04:29,531
I got a surprise for you.

1411
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:34,135
Unless it fits on my finger,
I've got to hit the sack.

1412
01:04:34,137 --> 01:04:35,036
It better fit,

1413
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:38,506
or I'm going to have
to take it back.

1414
01:04:38,508 --> 01:04:40,342
Sam, I thought this day

1415
01:04:40,344 --> 01:04:42,210
would never come.

1416
01:04:45,148 --> 01:04:46,014
When I saw it,

1417
01:04:46,016 --> 01:04:49,284
I thought
it was right up your alley.

1418
01:04:49,286 --> 01:04:51,186
I'm bowled over.

1419
01:04:56,326 --> 01:04:58,193
I always thought
our grandchildren

1420
01:04:58,195 --> 01:05:00,495
would come visit us
in this house.

1421
01:05:00,497 --> 01:05:03,298
Oh, Mike.

1422
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:06,101
You know, this is going to be

1423
01:05:06,103 --> 01:05:09,938
our last night in this bedroom.

1424
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:15,277
Why, Grandpa Brady.

1425
01:05:42,139 --> 01:05:42,704
Jan,

1426
01:05:42,706 --> 01:05:43,538
where are you going?

1427
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:46,041
Someplace where I can be
appreciated.

1428
01:05:46,043 --> 01:05:48,009
Go ahead and snitch if you want.

1429
01:05:48,011 --> 01:05:49,644
Just give me a head start.

1430
01:05:49,646 --> 01:05:50,412
I wouldn't snitch.

1431
01:05:50,414 --> 01:05:52,948
But how will we sing
without you?

1432
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:54,382
Why don't you ask Marcia?

1433
01:05:54,384 --> 01:05:58,520
Maybe she has
another brilliant idea.

1434
01:06:05,329 --> 01:06:07,662
Mom? Dad?

1435
01:06:11,501 --> 01:06:13,635
Uh... what is it, Cindy?

1436
01:06:13,637 --> 01:06:15,303
If you know something,

1437
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:17,238
but you don't want
to be a tattle,

1438
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:20,342
but it's very important
that you tell someone...

1439
01:06:20,344 --> 01:06:22,243
Cindy, let's talk about
it tomorrow.

1440
01:06:22,245 --> 01:06:24,412
But Jan could be dead by then!

1441
01:06:24,414 --> 01:06:25,647
What?!

1442
01:06:25,649 --> 01:06:27,215
Oops!

1443
01:06:27,217 --> 01:06:29,217
Why would Jan run
away like this?

1444
01:06:29,219 --> 01:06:33,455
Maybe we were thinking too
much about our problems

1445
01:06:33,457 --> 01:06:36,191
and not enough about the kids.

1446
01:06:36,193 --> 01:06:38,526
Did anyone say anything

1447
01:06:38,528 --> 01:06:39,661
that would make Jan run away?

1448
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:43,064
Nothing more than what
we usually say to her.

1449
01:06:43,066 --> 01:06:44,132
Yeah.

1450
01:06:44,134 --> 01:06:46,701
I'll get Alice.

1451
01:06:49,306 --> 01:06:51,139
Oh.

1452
01:06:51,141 --> 01:06:53,041
Hi, folks.

1453
01:06:53,043 --> 01:06:53,641
Sam,

1454
01:06:53,643 --> 01:06:55,276
what are you doing here?

1455
01:06:55,278 --> 01:06:58,613
Oh, I was just, um,
delivering some meat.

1456
01:06:58,615 --> 01:07:00,248
Well, it's a good thing
you're here.

1457
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:03,251
Jan ran away, and we
need you and Alice

1458
01:07:03,253 --> 01:07:04,519
to help find her.

1459
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:05,653
We'll circle the block.

1460
01:07:05,655 --> 01:07:06,755
You check the school.

1461
01:07:06,757 --> 01:07:08,390
Come on, gang, let's go.

1462
01:07:08,392 --> 01:07:10,492
Let's go.

1463
01:07:10,494 --> 01:07:14,262
Come on, everybody, hurry up.

1464
01:07:14,264 --> 01:07:15,063
Come on.

1465
01:07:15,065 --> 01:07:16,431
Come on, Cindy.

1466
01:07:16,433 --> 01:07:18,199
I call the way back.

1467
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:20,468
I got the backseat.

1468
01:07:24,274 --> 01:07:27,776
What happened?
Did an animal die on your head?

1469
01:07:29,246 --> 01:07:30,078
Hey, lose the hat.

1470
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,080
You'll be okay.

1471
01:08:08,819 --> 01:08:12,220
Keep your eyes peeled,
everybody.

1472
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:20,428
Breaker, one-nine,
breaker, one-nine,

1473
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,763
this is Christmas Carol.

1474
01:08:21,765 --> 01:08:25,100
Honey, no one's answered us
in years.

1475
01:08:25,102 --> 01:08:27,102
Oh, Mike, I have to try.

1476
01:08:28,505 --> 01:08:32,807
Breaker, one-nine,
do you read me?

1477
01:08:32,809 --> 01:08:35,844
Anyone out there?

1478
01:08:35,846 --> 01:08:38,113
I need a 20 on a little girl.

1479
01:08:38,115 --> 01:08:43,118
Blond, blue-eyed,
answers to the name of Jan.

1480
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,252
Tell her...

1481
01:08:44,254 --> 01:08:49,357
Mother Hen and Father Goose
love her very much.

1482
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:54,295
Come after me
if you're out there, over.

1483
01:08:58,401 --> 01:09:01,236
Huh. Sounds like some family

1484
01:09:01,238 --> 01:09:03,771
misses somebody
they love very much.

1485
01:09:03,773 --> 01:09:05,707
I don't have a family.

1486
01:09:05,709 --> 01:09:07,809
Oh, no family.

1487
01:09:07,811 --> 01:09:08,543
You know, sometimes

1488
01:09:08,545 --> 01:09:10,812
I'm driving the graveyard shift

1489
01:09:10,814 --> 01:09:11,814
in the middle of nowhere,

1490
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:14,716
I can't help thinking
what might have been

1491
01:09:14,718 --> 01:09:16,784
if I'd taken a different road...

1492
01:09:16,786 --> 01:09:18,753
married young, had a family...

1493
01:09:18,755 --> 01:09:19,587
three boys, three girls.

1494
01:09:19,589 --> 01:09:22,357
Oh, then a little voice says,
"Are you kidding?

1495
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:25,193
They'd probably just treat you
like a maid."

1496
01:09:25,195 --> 01:09:27,195
Do you want some of this, Jan?

1497
01:09:27,197 --> 01:09:28,296
No, thanks.

1498
01:09:28,298 --> 01:09:29,397
You have a little voice, too?

1499
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:33,735
Mmm. Oh, honey, when you're
on the road as long as I am,

1500
01:09:33,737 --> 01:09:35,436
you got to talk to somebody.

1501
01:09:35,438 --> 01:09:38,706
That's a trick I
learned growing up.

1502
01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:41,309
It's tough being a middle child.

1503
01:09:41,311 --> 01:09:44,345
You're a middle child.

1504
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:44,913
So am I.

1505
01:09:44,915 --> 01:09:47,348
Then you know what it feels like

1506
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:47,949
not being special.

1507
01:09:47,951 --> 01:09:51,319
<i>What does she mean,</i>
<i>"I'm not special?"</i>

1508
01:09:51,321 --> 01:09:53,588
<i>Hey, she's just trying to help.</i>

1509
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:54,355
My family's not much.

1510
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:56,724
No kids, though we do have
a lot of livestock.

1511
01:09:56,726 --> 01:10:00,228
<i>Jan! Oh, Jan!</i>

1512
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:01,729
<i>Don't listen to her!</i>

1513
01:10:01,731 --> 01:10:04,199
In this day and age,
if you're lucky enough...

1514
01:10:04,201 --> 01:10:04,599
<i>Who is that?</i>

1515
01:10:04,601 --> 01:10:08,303
<i>It's me... the new Jan Brady.</i>

1516
01:10:08,305 --> 01:10:10,471
<i>Let's knock over a 7-Eleven.</i>

1517
01:10:10,473 --> 01:10:12,240
<i>Stop! You're scaring me!</i>

1518
01:10:12,242 --> 01:10:13,908
<i>Me, too.</i> Me, too!

1519
01:10:22,652 --> 01:10:25,220
Mom? Dad?

1520
01:10:25,689 --> 01:10:28,456
Hi. I'm back.

1521
01:10:28,458 --> 01:10:29,991
Marcia? Cindy?

1522
01:10:29,993 --> 01:10:32,760
Are you up there?

1523
01:10:33,863 --> 01:10:36,998
Greg? Peter? Bobby?

1524
01:10:38,468 --> 01:10:40,568
Alice?

1525
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:44,639
Sam?

1526
01:10:45,942 --> 01:10:49,944
Christmas Carol, this is
Schultzy, come back to me.

1527
01:10:49,946 --> 01:10:54,616
Schultzy! Th-this
is Christmas Carol.

1528
01:10:54,618 --> 01:10:56,384
I got a 20 on a little girl.

1529
01:10:56,386 --> 01:11:01,456
Blue eyes, blonde hair,
answers to the name of Jan.

1530
01:11:02,892 --> 01:11:07,295
I just dropped her off
at 4222 Clinton Way.

1531
01:11:07,297 --> 01:11:09,664
Thank you, Schultzy, thank you

1532
01:11:09,666 --> 01:11:10,865
and God bless!

1533
01:11:10,867 --> 01:11:12,567
Over.

1534
01:11:12,569 --> 01:11:14,669
That's a big ten-four.

1535
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:22,010
Jan?

1536
01:11:22,012 --> 01:11:23,411
Jan, are you here?

1537
01:11:23,413 --> 01:11:25,413
Mom? Dad?

1538
01:11:25,415 --> 01:11:27,515
Oh, honey!

1539
01:11:27,517 --> 01:11:28,416
Oh, honey!

1540
01:11:28,418 --> 01:11:28,883
Oh, sweetheart.

1541
01:11:28,885 --> 01:11:31,019
I'm so glad you're safe!

1542
01:11:31,021 --> 01:11:31,719
Oh, honey,

1543
01:11:31,721 --> 01:11:33,855
what on earth
made you run away?

1544
01:11:33,857 --> 01:11:36,858
I thought no one wanted me here
anymore,

1545
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:39,560
but when I was out
in the real world,

1546
01:11:39,562 --> 01:11:42,964
I realized
that<i> I</i> wanted me to be here.

1547
01:11:42,966 --> 01:11:44,999
You're all a part of me

1548
01:11:45,001 --> 01:11:46,768
and I'm a part of you,

1549
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:48,770
and there's no escaping that...

1550
01:11:48,772 --> 01:11:51,706
but it makes me feel
really special.

1551
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:52,840
I couldn't have put it

1552
01:11:52,842 --> 01:11:55,543
better myself, Jan,
but I'll try anyway.

1553
01:11:55,545 --> 01:11:56,377
See, I've always believed

1554
01:11:56,379 --> 01:11:58,846
that it doesn't matter
where your home is,

1555
01:11:58,848 --> 01:12:00,915
because home
is where your heart is,

1556
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:01,949
and we may lose this house,

1557
01:12:01,951 --> 01:12:03,985
but we'll always
have our family

1558
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:05,586
because we're Bradys,

1559
01:12:05,588 --> 01:12:06,988
and this family is our home.

1560
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:09,991
That's why we'll
always have our home.

1561
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:11,326
As long as we have our family,

1562
01:12:11,328 --> 01:12:14,529
even if we lose our house,
we're still Bradys.

1563
01:12:14,531 --> 01:12:15,997
Your father's right.

1564
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:18,733
Oh, yeah, absolutely, Dad.

1565
01:12:18,735 --> 01:12:20,101
Maybe we can still

1566
01:12:20,103 --> 01:12:20,968
save the house.

1567
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:21,703
How about Jan's idea

1568
01:12:21,705 --> 01:12:24,939
of the "Search for
the Stars" contest?

1569
01:12:24,941 --> 01:12:26,741
Jan's idea?

1570
01:12:26,743 --> 01:12:27,842
Yes, it was Jan's,

1571
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:29,677
and it's a really great plan.

1572
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:32,413
What's "Search for the Stars?"

1573
01:12:32,415 --> 01:12:33,081
It's a contest

1574
01:12:33,083 --> 01:12:34,849
for the best musical group,

1575
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:37,819
and there's a first prize
of $20,000.

1576
01:12:37,821 --> 01:12:40,655
And singing
one of Greg's songs,

1577
01:12:40,657 --> 01:12:41,522
we're sure to win.

1578
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:44,959
Well, then, you're going to have
to sing it without me.

1579
01:12:44,961 --> 01:12:46,627
Huh? What? Why?

1580
01:12:46,629 --> 01:12:50,498
I thought I could change my name
and my personality

1581
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:53,368
and become
some big, flashy rock star,

1582
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:55,737
but I was just kidding myself.

1583
01:12:55,739 --> 01:12:56,637
Nobody liked my act.

1584
01:12:56,639 --> 01:13:00,742
I guess
I just don't have what it takes.

1585
01:13:02,912 --> 01:13:04,112
Well, let's face it,

1586
01:13:04,114 --> 01:13:07,081
Johnny Bravo's nothing but...

1587
01:13:07,083 --> 01:13:08,049
Johnny Rotten.

1588
01:13:08,051 --> 01:13:09,417
You're right, son.

1589
01:13:09,419 --> 01:13:12,787
Johnny Bravo doesn't have
what it takes...

1590
01:13:12,789 --> 01:13:14,455
but Greg Brady does.

1591
01:13:14,457 --> 01:13:15,456
He has us,

1592
01:13:15,458 --> 01:13:17,392
and this family
can accomplish anything.

1593
01:13:17,394 --> 01:13:21,129
Alone, we can only move buckets,
but if we work together,

1594
01:13:21,131 --> 01:13:22,029
we can drain rivers.

1595
01:13:22,031 --> 01:13:23,097
Your father's right.

1596
01:13:23,099 --> 01:13:25,500
The eight of us separate

1597
01:13:25,502 --> 01:13:26,000
are just eight...

1598
01:13:26,002 --> 01:13:28,803
well, with Alice, we're nine,
but nine...

1599
01:13:28,805 --> 01:13:30,405
Yes, well, technically...

1600
01:13:30,407 --> 01:13:31,072
And with Sam, ten,

1601
01:13:31,074 --> 01:13:34,542
but ten separate, just ten.

1602
01:13:34,544 --> 01:13:35,843
Together...

1603
01:13:35,845 --> 01:13:36,944
we're a Bunch.

1604
01:13:36,946 --> 01:13:39,013
Yeah. The Brady Bunch.

1605
01:13:39,015 --> 01:13:40,915
What do you say, Greg?

1606
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:42,550
Please?

1607
01:13:46,156 --> 01:13:48,423
Well, what are we waiting for?

1608
01:13:48,425 --> 01:13:49,425
Grab some costumes.

1609
01:13:49,426 --> 01:13:51,692
We've got to make that contest!

1610
01:13:51,694 --> 01:13:54,695
Okay! All right!

1611
01:14:00,837 --> 01:14:02,036
¶ We are blood ¶

1612
01:14:02,038 --> 01:14:03,538
¶ We don't vote ¶

1613
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:06,174
¶ We are standing all alone ¶

1614
01:14:06,176 --> 01:14:08,042
¶ At the beginning ¶

1615
01:14:08,044 --> 01:14:09,610
¶ Of the end ¶

1616
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:11,446
¶ We are phlegm ¶

1617
01:14:11,448 --> 01:14:14,849
¶ We are phlegm. ¶

1618
01:14:14,851 --> 01:14:16,184
I'm so nervous.

1619
01:14:16,186 --> 01:14:17,084
Why am I so nervous?

1620
01:14:17,086 --> 01:14:20,755
Stop it.
You're making<i> me</i> nervous.

1621
01:14:22,926 --> 01:14:26,794
All right, let's have
a big hand for Phlegm.

1622
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:31,899
Yay!

1623
01:14:33,069 --> 01:14:34,168
You sounded hot.

1624
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:37,071
What, are you...
completely brain-dead?

1625
01:14:37,073 --> 01:14:39,140
Leon missed an entire riff.

1626
01:14:39,142 --> 01:14:40,908
Didn't you hear it?

1627
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:42,577
I liked it.

1628
01:14:42,579 --> 01:14:45,913
You're such a loser.

1629
01:14:49,853 --> 01:14:51,219
Hey, Eric.

1630
01:14:51,221 --> 01:14:52,186
I'm sick and tired

1631
01:14:52,188 --> 01:14:55,089
of seeing you treat
Holly that way.

1632
01:14:55,091 --> 01:14:55,890
In fact...

1633
01:14:55,892 --> 01:14:58,826
I'm sick and tired
of you altogether.

1634
01:14:59,496 --> 01:15:01,963
You're nothing but a...

1635
01:15:01,965 --> 01:15:03,598
a big bully.

1636
01:15:05,969 --> 01:15:07,101
You're dog meat, Brady.

1637
01:15:07,103 --> 01:15:12,607
Do it... and die, Eric.

1638
01:15:17,046 --> 01:15:18,779
Ohh!

1639
01:15:18,781 --> 01:15:19,680
Ohh!

1640
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:21,048
Oh.

1641
01:15:22,285 --> 01:15:24,619
Hurry, Peter.

1642
01:15:24,621 --> 01:15:25,720
We're on.

1643
01:15:25,722 --> 01:15:27,588
Thanks, Peter.

1644
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:30,992
I think you're really... neato.

1645
01:15:32,295 --> 01:15:35,696
- Oh, yes.
- I hope everybody's having

1646
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:36,097
a good time.

1647
01:15:36,099 --> 01:15:40,101
Why, uh... thank you, Holly.

1648
01:15:40,103 --> 01:15:45,573
I think you're... Ginger
and Mary Ann combined.

1649
01:15:46,209 --> 01:15:48,209
Come on, Peter. That's us.

1650
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:49,110
See ya.

1651
01:15:49,112 --> 01:15:50,177
Good luck.

1652
01:15:58,821 --> 01:16:03,824
¶ Flying down the highway

1653
01:16:03,826 --> 01:16:04,592

1687
01:17:58,408 --> 01:18:00,841
Thank you, Brady Bunch.

1688
01:18:01,778 --> 01:18:03,210
You were great.

1689
01:18:03,212 --> 01:18:04,311
Great.

1690
01:18:04,313 --> 01:18:07,381
Give the rest
of our contestants a big hand

1691
01:18:07,383 --> 01:18:08,416
as our judges

1692
01:18:08,418 --> 01:18:11,018
tally up the scores.

1693
01:18:14,223 --> 01:18:16,023
Thank you.

1694
01:18:16,325 --> 01:18:17,992
And I have it right here.

1695
01:18:17,994 --> 01:18:19,260
The winner of the Search

1696
01:18:19,262 --> 01:18:23,064
for the Stars
$20,000 grand prize is...

1697
01:18:23,866 --> 01:18:26,133
the Brady Bunch?

1698
01:18:32,008 --> 01:18:34,308
Hey, great job. Thanks.

1699
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:37,978
They what?!

1700
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:40,214
How could those losers
win anything?

1701
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:42,349
Look, Eric,
you got to stall them for me.

1702
01:18:42,351 --> 01:18:44,885
What do you mean,
what's in it for you?

1703
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:46,854
All right,
you have my permission

1704
01:18:46,856 --> 01:18:48,389
to pierce anything you want.

1705
01:18:48,391 --> 01:18:51,025
Just keep them
from getting here.

1706
01:18:51,027 --> 01:18:52,727
Damn kid.

1707
01:19:01,771 --> 01:19:03,270
Come on.

1708
01:19:05,842 --> 01:19:06,407
Well, here it is.

1709
01:19:06,409 --> 01:19:09,043
A check made out
to the Brady Bunch

1710
01:19:09,045 --> 01:19:11,178
for $20,000.

1711
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:12,480
Come on, gang, let's go. Hurry!

1712
01:19:12,482 --> 01:19:13,314
All right, everybody.

1713
01:19:13,316 --> 01:19:14,448
Let's hear it for them Bradys.

1714
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:15,483
They were something else.

1715
01:19:15,485 --> 01:19:16,217
Thanks for coming down.

1716
01:19:16,219 --> 01:19:19,153
I hope you had a good time
and we'll see you...

1717
01:19:19,756 --> 01:19:20,521
Come on, come on.

1718
01:19:20,523 --> 01:19:21,422
Let's go, troops!

1719
01:19:21,424 --> 01:19:23,257
Come on! Hurry up!

1720
01:19:25,862 --> 01:19:27,361
Hey, there, groovy chicks.

1721
01:19:27,363 --> 01:19:30,865
You're all happening
in far out ways.

1722
01:19:30,867 --> 01:19:33,000
Greg, hurry. The house.

1723
01:19:40,209 --> 01:19:42,843
Now, how do you suppose
that happened?

1724
01:19:42,845 --> 01:19:45,446
Oh, Mike.
What are we going to do?

1725
01:19:46,249 --> 01:19:49,250
Hey, Marcia, look.
It's our friend, Eddie.

1726
01:19:49,252 --> 01:19:50,217
You remember.

1727
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:51,452
The guy who needed a car jack.

1728
01:19:51,454 --> 01:19:54,522
Come on, everybody.
He can give us a lift.

1729
01:19:59,796 --> 01:20:01,162
Hey, Eddie!

1730
01:20:01,164 --> 01:20:02,563
Oh, no.

1731
01:20:02,565 --> 01:20:04,965
Can you give us a ride?

1732
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:06,100
A ride?

1733
01:20:06,102 --> 01:20:08,536
Good afternoon.

1734
01:20:08,538 --> 01:20:09,436
Having trouble

1735
01:20:09,438 --> 01:20:11,005
with the car alarm?

1736
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:12,006
No. It's not our car.

1737
01:20:12,008 --> 01:20:13,874
It's our friend Eddie's.

1738
01:20:13,876 --> 01:20:15,843
Oh, really?

1739
01:20:15,845 --> 01:20:17,845
Where are the keys, Eddie?

1740
01:20:17,847 --> 01:20:19,146
I lost them.

1741
01:20:19,148 --> 01:20:19,513
Oh, no.

1742
01:20:19,515 --> 01:20:23,017
But we were counting on you
to give us a ride to our house.

1743
01:20:23,019 --> 01:20:24,151
I'll run the plate.

1744
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:25,152
Uh, excuse me, Officer

1745
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:28,589
but I'd hate to ask
a law enforcement official

1746
01:20:28,591 --> 01:20:30,291
to bend the rules...

1747
01:20:30,293 --> 01:20:32,593
especially for penal code 117

1748
01:20:32,595 --> 01:20:34,228
section 33-B,

1749
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:35,563
but our house is at stake.

1750
01:20:40,369 --> 01:20:43,170
Please?

1751
01:20:44,841 --> 01:20:46,106
2:00. Auction time.

1752
01:20:46,108 --> 01:20:49,176
It's exciting, isn't it, Alice?

1753
01:20:49,946 --> 01:20:51,846
By the power authorized me

1754
01:20:51,848 --> 01:20:52,847
by the county of Los Angeles,

1755
01:20:52,849 --> 01:20:56,283
I hereby offer this property
to the highest bidder,

1756
01:20:56,285 --> 01:20:57,585
unless the owner redeems...

1757
01:20:57,587 --> 01:20:59,286
Come on, come on, come on.

1758
01:20:59,288 --> 01:20:59,920
Okay, I'll start

1759
01:20:59,922 --> 01:21:03,924
the bidding at the sum total
of back taxes: $20,000.

1760
01:21:03,926 --> 01:21:05,326
Do I have any takers?

1761
01:21:05,328 --> 01:21:08,596
Say... I've got $20,000.

1762
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:11,999
Stop the auction!

1763
01:21:13,269 --> 01:21:16,437
We have the money
for the tax bill.

1764
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,406
I repeat,

1765
01:21:19,408 --> 01:21:20,608
stop the auction.

1766
01:21:20,610 --> 01:21:23,110
We have the money
for the tax bill.

1767
01:21:23,112 --> 01:21:25,579
The house is still ours.

1768
01:21:25,581 --> 01:21:27,381
Come on, kids.

1769
01:21:30,953 --> 01:21:32,920
Hold everything.

1770
01:21:34,457 --> 01:21:36,056
Good news, everybody.

1771
01:21:36,058 --> 01:21:39,059
The Bradys are here to stay.

1772
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:40,361
You lied to us, Dittmeyer.

1773
01:21:40,363 --> 01:21:42,129
The Bradys aren't selling.

1774
01:21:42,131 --> 01:21:42,997
I knew it!

1775
01:21:42,999 --> 01:21:43,597
You guaranteed us!

1776
01:21:43,599 --> 01:21:45,132
You ruined us, Dittmeyer.

1777
01:21:45,134 --> 01:21:46,166
You're going to pay for this.

1778
01:21:46,168 --> 01:21:48,035
Now, hold on, people.

1779
01:21:48,037 --> 01:21:49,603
Wait a minute.

1780
01:21:50,172 --> 01:21:51,472
The man you should
be angry with

1781
01:21:51,474 --> 01:21:55,009
is me, 'cause our house
is more important than money.

1782
01:21:55,011 --> 01:21:58,178
This neighborhood is more
important than money.

1783
01:21:58,180 --> 01:21:59,013
Tell me, how many times

1784
01:21:59,015 --> 01:22:01,015
have we borrowed
each other's power tools

1785
01:22:01,017 --> 01:22:02,683
or patched up
each other's kids?

1786
01:22:02,685 --> 01:22:04,618
We know so much
about each other.

1787
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:07,922
I know that every January,
Mr. Yeager's going to have

1788
01:22:07,924 --> 01:22:10,925
that big Super Bowl party
at his house.

1789
01:22:10,927 --> 01:22:11,292
Yeah.

1790
01:22:11,294 --> 01:22:12,927
We know every spring
Mrs. Simmons

1791
01:22:12,929 --> 01:22:15,429
is going to have the prettiest
daffodils on the block.

1792
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:17,331
They are beautiful.
They are lovely flowers.

1793
01:22:17,333 --> 01:22:20,167
We know that at 10:15
every Saturday morning,

1794
01:22:20,169 --> 01:22:21,402
Mrs. Topping likes to walk

1795
01:22:21,404 --> 01:22:23,685
through her living room naked.

1796
01:22:24,507 --> 01:22:25,639
You knew about that?

1797
01:22:25,641 --> 01:22:27,107
Call me old-fashioned,

1798
01:22:27,109 --> 01:22:29,143
but these things are important

1799
01:22:29,145 --> 01:22:31,078
and they're not for sale.

1800
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:33,347
This is our neighborhood...

1801
01:22:33,349 --> 01:22:35,316
and we're staying.

1802
01:22:35,685 --> 01:22:38,686
Now, this is going
to sound crazy...

1803
01:22:38,688 --> 01:22:40,354
but Brady's right.

1804
01:22:40,356 --> 01:22:42,056
We're never going to find

1805
01:22:42,058 --> 01:22:43,157
another neighborhood like this.

1806
01:22:43,159 --> 01:22:47,261
And we'll never find neighbors
like the Bradys.

1807
01:22:48,431 --> 01:22:50,464
We're staying, too.

1808
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:51,632
Us, too.

1809
01:22:51,634 --> 01:22:53,200
So are we.

1810
01:22:53,202 --> 01:22:54,568
We will, too.

1811
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:56,170
Great.

1812
01:22:56,172 --> 01:22:58,072
Gosh, I wish I lived here.

1813
01:22:58,607 --> 01:23:01,041
I mean, it's...
it's incredible.

1814
01:23:01,043 --> 01:23:03,477
You people are all staying...

1815
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:08,615
because one family
is willing to stand up

1816
01:23:08,617 --> 01:23:10,150
for what they believe in?

1817
01:23:10,152 --> 01:23:12,152
Well... that and
the huge settlement

1818
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:16,623
we're going to get after
we sue Dittmeyer's ass.

1819
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:17,324
Oh, Mike.

1820
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:19,626
I always knew
you could hit a grand slam

1821
01:23:19,628 --> 01:23:22,229
and now we can stay
in our house after all.

1822
01:23:22,231 --> 01:23:26,533
Hey, do you know who'd
love to hear about this?

1823
01:23:27,603 --> 01:23:29,236
Grandma!

1824
01:23:29,238 --> 01:23:30,037
Hey.

1825
01:23:33,142 --> 01:23:35,542
Hi, everybody.

1826
01:23:36,712 --> 01:23:40,714
Wait a minute.

1827
01:23:40,716 --> 01:23:43,517
Look, how pretty
you have gotten.

1828
01:23:43,519 --> 01:23:45,519
Oh, those clothes.

1829
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:47,121
Oh, what taste.

1830
01:23:47,123 --> 01:23:48,622
And that smile...

1831
01:23:48,624 --> 01:23:53,727
Oh, Marcia,
you are such a beauty.

1832
01:23:53,729 --> 01:23:56,130
<i>Everyone loves Marcia.</i>

1833
01:23:56,132 --> 01:23:57,064
<i>No one loves you.</i>

1834
01:23:57,066 --> 01:24:00,300
<i>Watch my head spin.</i>

1835
01:24:00,302 --> 01:24:03,103
<i>Kill, kill, kill!</i>

1836
01:24:03,105 --> 01:24:04,238
No, stop it!

1837
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:05,572
I can't take it anymore!

1838
01:24:06,709 --> 01:24:09,076
<i>Aw, shut up, you loser!</i>

1839
01:24:09,078 --> 01:24:09,710
Jan!

1840
01:24:09,712 --> 01:24:10,592
Cut the crap.

1841
01:24:13,716 --> 01:24:14,782
They're gone.

1842
01:24:14,784 --> 01:24:16,750
Thank you, Grandma.

1843
01:24:16,752 --> 01:24:19,053
Oh, there.

1844
01:24:19,055 --> 01:24:21,288
<i>Cindy.</i>

1845
01:24:21,290 --> 01:24:22,389
<i>Oh, Cindy.</i>

1846
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:24,825
<i>Why does Jan get</i>
<i>all the attention?</i>

1847
01:24:24,827 --> 01:24:30,431
<i>Yeah. It's always</i>
<i>Jan, Jan, Jan.</i>

1848
01:25:58,554 --> 01:26:01,221
¶ The Brady Bunch ¶

1849
01:26:01,223 --> 01:26:02,589
¶ The Brady Bunch ¶

1850
01:26:02,591 --> 01:26:09,796
¶ That's the way we became
the Brady Bunch. ¶

1851
01:26:24,813 --> 01:26:28,549
¶ I remember someone said ¶

1852
01:26:28,551 --> 01:26:32,286
¶ Even when we lose, we win ¶

1853
01:26:32,288 --> 01:26:35,322
¶ Well, we must
be winning now ¶

1854
01:26:35,324 --> 01:26:39,459
¶ Cause it's got that losing
feeling ¶ ¶ Mom always said ¶

1855
01:26:39,461 --> 01:26:43,430
¶ Don't throw the ball
in the house ¶

1856
01:26:43,432 --> 01:26:46,867
¶ I only wish that I had known ¶

1857
01:26:46,869 --> 01:26:50,804
¶ Maybe I would
not have broken ¶

1858
01:26:50,806 --> 01:26:53,840
¶ Every single thing I own ¶

1859
01:26:53,842 --> 01:26:58,679
¶ Just wait for fate to change
the life that you hate ¶

1860
01:26:58,681 --> 01:27:01,481
¶ Down to your DNA ¶

1861
01:27:01,483 --> 01:27:05,886
¶ Just wait for fate to change
the life that you hate ¶

1862
01:27:05,888 --> 01:27:08,355
¶ And get out of our way ¶

1863
01:27:08,357 --> 01:27:10,591
¶ Have a nice day ¶

1864
01:27:16,265 --> 01:27:20,367
¶ You know your father
is right ¶

1865
01:27:20,369 --> 01:27:23,870
¶ And he's always going to be ¶

1866
01:27:23,872 --> 01:27:27,708
¶ Well, that makes me
feel so great ¶

1867
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:30,911
¶ Cause I just
love being angry ¶

1868
01:27:30,913 --> 01:27:35,616
¶ Just wait for fate to change
the life that you hate ¶

1869
01:27:35,618 --> 01:27:37,284
¶ Down to your DNA ¶

1870
01:27:37,286 --> 01:27:42,889

the life that you hate ¶
