1
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,310
We really need to get an elevator.

2
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,190
That's why we have fire poles.

3
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,089
Yeah, but you know Cap...

4
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,189
last time I checked, that was
more of a one way only deal.

5
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,159
You know, kind of directional.

6
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,570
Is there any thing you need, Kayden?

7
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,070
Right, we need your... digital camera.

8
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,809
Does it have anything to do with...

9
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,719
for a silly girl named...

10
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,709
J.C.?

11
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,960
It's not that silly.

12
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:35,960
No...

13
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:40,290
Well, like she says, who says you
can't be sexy and save lives?

14
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,039
Hey Cap! You mind?

15
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,540
[??]

16
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,039
Wooo!

17
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:10,380
No, no, no. I'm the best friend,
I'll take the pictures. Thank you.

18
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,580
Make sure you get my good side, OK?

19
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,460
Does she have a bad side?

20
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,269
No.

21
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,769
Hey, did you guys see
last year's winner?

22
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,159
Oh, yeah. Right.

23
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,540
Here, here, give me the damn thing.
Let me take the picture.

24
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,290
Stop it! Stop!

25
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,339
Go! Go!

26
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,710
OK. Hold on.

27
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,279
You looking good, girl!

28
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,100
You're gonna win this year, for sure.

29
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,529
Thanks for the support.

30
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,619
Your welcome.

31
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,960
So, do you think he's gonna
pop the question tonight?

32
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,459
I dunno. I hope so.

33
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,959
Well, if he doesn't do it soon...
I'm gonna marry you.

34
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,789
Give me a hug.

35
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,569
Ohhhh, thanks girl, I'll see you.

36
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,920
I'll see you at work. Bye.

37
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,950
I wanna drive you to work.

38
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,329
Did you catch that fight last night?

39
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,129
No man, I had to...

40
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,080
It's a good thing because
your boy got knocked out!

41
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,929
Please!

42
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,680
About time. Did you get my coffee?

43
00:17:07,681 --> 00:17:09,000
Yeah, right.

44
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,189
So what's the deal?

45
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,969
Has he asked you yet?

46
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,970
Not yet. But I think he's about to.

47
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,429
You are so lucky. Manuel
is such a great catch!

48
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,540
You think?

49
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,860
So this isn't a fire call. What is it?

50
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,440
So there's the 411.

51
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,040
Seems some people downtown
are not happy with

52
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,129
his plans to buy this
property from the city.

53
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:05,739
To turn downtown into uptown.

54
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,809
Turns out, they got the groundbreaking
ceremony this Saturday.

55
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,400
Here on this very lot.

56
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,709
Piece of cake.

57
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,839
Got your ears on buddy?

58
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,909
What?

59
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,700
Very funny.

60
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,080
Looking good. Hey.

61
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,230
With all the chicks watching,
make us look good, huh?

62
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,770
Your now in the kill zone.

63
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,799
What do you see?

64
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,300
I can't see shit!

65
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,759
Oh shit!

66
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,900
What do you got?

67
00:20:20,901 --> 00:20:24,399
We got to talk. Really.

68
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,030
There are 2.

69
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:48,799
Hal, we got a nice set here.

70
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,300
Ply or block? Block.

71
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,700
Piece of cake.

72
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,990
Wait. Hold on.

73
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,440
Hold one sec. What do you got coach?

74
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,980
We got a secondary.

75
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,759
Primaries were a decoy.

76
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,520
These are the real bad boys.

[Dramatic music]

78
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,540
Think it's time we got a new TV set.

79
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,060
Right there, right there!

Announcer on TV: An unfortunate
industrial explosion

81
00:26:12,162 --> 00:26:14,360
took the life of a lone
firefighter earlier this week.

82
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:22,590
Cash Gates says that this will not be a
setback in his development projects.

83
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,799
Fuck that guy!

84
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,109
Next time he can defuse
the bomb himself.

85
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:33,780
What? What did I say?

86
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,519
Oh, Kayden.

87
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,259
The psychological
examiner is here for you.

88
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,549
For me, huh?

89
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:14,149
For all of us. It's routine
after a tragedy like this.

90
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:16,359
What to be harassed?

91
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,859
Why can't they just leave us alone?
Let us do our jobs?

92
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:23,129
Because they can't. They
have to do their jobs.

93
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:26,630
That means evaluate. She's in
my office waiting for you.

94
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,150
Mr. Gates.

95
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,279
Is there something I can help you with?

96
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,859
Hello Captain. You remember
my assistant Becky?

97
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,659
I can remember lots of things Mr. Gates.

98
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:12,650
Cash. Please. My friends call me Cash.

99
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:20,080
So what is it you need, Mr... Gates?

100
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,445
I was just taking this
opportunity to familiarize Becky

101
00:28:24,446 --> 00:28:27,729
with some of the changes
needed to this property.

102
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:30,539
Once my firm acquires it.

103
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,089
I see.

104
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:38,860
And, are your certain that your firm
is acquiring the firehouse property?

105
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:44,029
Captain, your property and one other...

106
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:47,470
are the only 2 left to complete the

107
00:28:47,471 --> 00:28:50,909
monopoly of property
needed for my project.

108
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:56,389
I see. But the city owns this property.

109
00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:00,099
The city, Captain, wants money.

110
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,630
And they have accepted my
proposal for purchase.

111
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,729
Everything has its price, Captain.

112
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:08,219
You of all people
should understand that.

113
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,459
So this is about money, huh?

114
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:13,960
This is about progress.

115
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,070
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't
see you standing there.

116
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,829
Maybe you'll be in it this year.

117
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:03,639
It's gonna be me. It's gonna be my year.
She only beat me by 2 votes.

118
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,140
I know. I voted for her.

119
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,679
So guess what I just overheard
in the engine room?

120
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,159
I'm listening.

121
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,660
That's it. We just gonna
sell the property?

122
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,339
Shut us down?

123
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,379
Well, maybe the city opens
a new fire station.

124
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,130
Or worse, maybe they
shut us down for good

125
00:30:26,131 --> 00:30:27,879
and we get reassigned
to new locations.

126
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,929
You mean we won't all be together?

127
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,230
Not usually, Riley.

128
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:35,730
What if I get reassigned to Antarctica?

129
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:39,230
Oh, goody! You can go
see your mom and dad!

130
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,969
I'm from Austria! Not Antarctica.

131

Oh. I keep forgetting. Good day mate!

132
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,890
This is serious you guys. I for one
don't want to be looking for a new job.

133
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:56,109
Listen Kayden. I'm here for you.

134
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:59,610
But if you don't open,
up I can't help you.

135
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,499
You don't even know me.

136
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,000
And here you are...
trying to evaluate me.

137
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,489
I'm not trying to evaluate you Kayden.

138
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:12,000
Are we done here?

139
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:16,119
Of course. This is strictly
voluntary, and not required.

only for yourself...

and let them take our building!

ourselves to save our building.

now if you're still interested.

Yeah! Fun time!

00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,869
OK sure. But what can we do? How
can we raise that kind of money?

169
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,779

lives was free of charge.

certainly save this building.

I have an idea!

that I've been this way...

or I mean the way that I am
for as long as I can remember.

please, go on, as long
as you feel comfortable.

on my Mom's friend.

181
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,439
Boy, she was something to look at!

182
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,859
She had really big boobs. I mean...

183
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,359
I mean... Can I say that?
I mean boobs.

184
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,860
Go on. Go on, Tom. I'm listening.

185
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,039
Yeah, her name was Jill.

186
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,939
I fact she was around so much, that
my mom had me calling her Aunty Jill.

187
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,409
Boy! Aunty Jill!

188
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:17,519
And then there was this babysitter.

189
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,649
She was older too.

190
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,219
I was like, fifteen at the time.

191
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:26,469
This was right around the time that I
discovered that I loved masturbating.

192
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:30,759
In fact, I would try to get
caught by the babysitter.

193
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:35,030
Hoping she would catch me with my pants
around my ankles, pulling on my dick.

194
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,530
I can't believe I'm telling you this!

195
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,899
I see. So what you're saying is...

196
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,839
or what you're
trying to tell me is...

197
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,340
you have an infatuation
with authority figures.

198
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,839
OK. Is that what I'm saying?

199
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,880
Yes.

200
00:37:56,510 --> 00:38:00,540
So this is normal. I'm not
like any freak or anything?

201
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:04,670
A freak? Hardly Tom.

202
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,529
You've seen this before?

203
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,760
Quite often, Tom.

204
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:18,259
See many men in the...
well, in your position...

205
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:21,299
see me as a bit of
an authority figure.

206
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,399
Maybe even as a motherly figure.

207
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,319
Huh. I guess I can see that.

208
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,819
Oh, you can?

209
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:32,320
Yeah, I can.

210
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,280
You're such a bad, bad boy Tommy.

211
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:50,520
Now come to Momma!

212
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:41,850
Wow! There must be like 2
million dollars in here!

213
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:46,909
We can't buy a fire station
with this you guys.

214
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:49,719
Hell! We can't even buy our
own beer and hot wings!

215
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,009
Well, anybody else got any bright ideas?

216
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:54,880
I'm working on it. Give me a minute.

217
00:49:54,881 --> 00:49:56,589
Oh, Oh, Oh! I have another idea.

218
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:58,609
No! I have an idea.

219
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:02,109
Why don't you guys quit while
you're ahead? Give it up.

220
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:03,760
Over.

221
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:09,819
This is a really, really good idea!
I swear!

222
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,950
Mr. Jamison, this is Cash
Gates you're speaking to.

223
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:21,495
Sir, you've not found
it necessary to show up

224
00:50:21,496 --> 00:50:24,200
for the last 3 appointments
we've made for you.

225
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:56,990
Our firm is still very interested
in acquiring your property.

226
00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:02,370
Yes, and we're now ready to make an
even larger offer than we did before.

227
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:08,720
Mr. Jamison! Mr. Jamison.

228
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:13,939
I told you so.

229
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:17,440
Yes. You did.

230
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,449
Cadet Riley.

231
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:25,949
And to what do I owe the
pleasure of this glorious visit?

232
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:29,729
Well, I was in the neighborhood and
thought I'd stop by to say hi.

233
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:31,850
So... hi.

234
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,349
Hi!

235
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:37,579
Unfortunately Riley, I've very busy.

236
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:41,079
I have a lot of work to do. So...

237
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,949
So I could maybe...

238
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:46,450
spend the day staring at
your youthful good looks.

239
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:49,950
She is rather good looking isn't she?

240
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,459
Very.

241
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:55,959
Oh, thanks guys. But...

242
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,020
I'm here to talk
about the fire station.

243
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:01,519
My home.

244
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,929
Well, it is a shame to see it go.

245
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:07,430
But, it stands in the way of progress.

246
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:11,040
There's got to be something
we can do to stop you

247
00:52:11,041 --> 00:52:13,649
from buying the fire house
and shutting us down.

248
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:17,729
Well, there might be
something you can do.

249
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:19,910
What's that?

250
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:22,735
You could offer to buy
the property from the

251
00:52:22,736 --> 00:52:24,779
city with a larger
offer than I've made.

252
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,150
Really?

253
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:29,299
Riley

254
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:32,089
Do you have that kind of money?

255
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:35,279
Well... No... But...

256
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,479
That's why I got this idea.

257
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,429
I was thinking...

258
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:41,320
maybe you could loan us the money...

259
00:52:41,321 --> 00:52:43,880
and then we could pay you back.

260
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,969
Riley...

261
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:47,630
Are you serious?

262
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:53,330
No Mr. Gates.

263
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:07,720
Are you serious Mr. Gates?

264
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:16,570
Very serious.

265
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,340
Hungry Becky?

266
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,530
Starving!

267
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,570
Liking that, huh? Yeah.

268
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:02,310
You like Mr. Gates
touching you like that?

269
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:09,549
Gonna be a... good girl for us?

270
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:13,050
Yeah.

271
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:19,010
I think Mr. Gates has something for us.

272
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:33,170
Gonna show me how you can do this?

273
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:48,739
Mitch!

274
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:51,889
Did you talk to the psychiatrist
for an evaluation yet?

275
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:53,469
Not yet, Captain.

276
01:09:54,370 --> 01:09:57,479
Well done. I'll guess you'll
be heading to my office.

277
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,589
Right now. Won't you?

278
01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:02,279
Yep. Right away, Captain.

279
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:03,920
Anything you say.

280
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:49,999
So.

281
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:55,819
You're telling me that you also have
a fetish for women with authority?

282
01:10:55,820 --> 01:11:01,690
Not women. Just one woman in particular.

283
01:11:31,730 --> 01:11:34,250
He would've been good to you.

284
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:44,109
It was just too much to handle.

285
01:11:44,110 --> 01:11:46,130
All I want is a willing hand.

286
01:11:47,050 --> 01:11:49,179
The fire house.

287
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:52,680
Don't say that. We haven't
lost the fire house yet.

288
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:59,259
You know what you need?

289
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:02,759
You need a night out.

290
01:12:04,090 --> 01:12:07,590
Yes you do! You need to get drunk.

291
01:12:09,310 --> 01:12:12,629
No. I really don't.

292
01:12:12,630 --> 01:12:16,129
Oh, yes. Yes you do.
You need to get drunk.

293
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:18,929
And I know exactly who to call.

294
01:12:18,930 --> 01:12:22,430
No, no, no, no.

295
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:38,370
Yeah.

296
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:40,750
Easy.

297
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:48,610
Easy. You're gonna break it.

298
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,239
Here, let me show you.

299
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:56,739
I like... mmm...

300
01:24:56,740 --> 01:25:00,239
that one the best. What do you think?

301
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:03,049
I think you're real serious
about winning this thing.

302
01:25:03,050 --> 01:25:05,969
I'm serious about saving this place.

303
01:25:05,970 --> 01:25:09,470
And keeping the team together.

304
01:25:09,930 --> 01:25:13,080
Oh, I think you're the
kind of girl that

305
01:25:13,081 --> 01:25:16,229
puts her mind to it,
she can do anything.

306
01:25:16,230 --> 01:25:19,630
Oh, yeah? Anything?

307
01:25:20,530 --> 01:25:22,900
Anything.

308
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:38,619
Hey, you know, I make
a mean pasta sauce?

309
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:42,120
A what? I make a mean pasta sauce.

310
01:25:43,010 --> 01:25:49,650
If you know, you will have dinner.

311
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:04,009
A pasta sauce.

312
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:08,170
Yeah, a mean pasta sauce.

313
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:12,490
Give me that.

314
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:19,010
A mean pasta sauce? Yeah,
a mean pasta sauce.

315
02:02:41,960 --> 02:02:44,830
Hope I'm not disturbing you, Captain?

316
02:02:45,550 --> 02:02:48,039
How can I help you, Mr. Gates?

317
02:02:48,040 --> 02:02:51,540
I came to get your signature
on these documents.

318
02:02:55,270 --> 02:02:59,809
I believe, that one there...

319
02:02:59,810 --> 02:03:02,640
is the deed to the property.

320
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:05,979
I don't understand.

321
02:03:05,980 --> 02:03:08,269
It's quite simple, Captain.

322
02:03:08,270 --> 02:03:10,499
You're going to sign the
deed to the property...

323
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:14,689
And that in turn will grant title
to you and your battalion.

324
02:03:14,690 --> 02:03:17,699
So the fire house is...

325
02:03:17,700 --> 02:03:20,699
It's all bought and paid for by my firm.

326
02:03:20,700 --> 02:03:23,039
In your name of course.

327
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:27,209
So if you'd care to make it
official, and sign the deed.

328
02:03:27,210 --> 02:03:30,710
And Becky here will notarize it for you.

329
02:03:44,940 --> 02:03:47,229
What a minute. We're staying?

330
02:03:47,230 --> 02:03:48,479
We're staying.

331
02:03:48,480 --> 02:03:50,559
We get to keep the fire station?

332
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:54,649
Cash has decided the best way to
keep his downtown investment...

333
02:03:54,650 --> 02:03:58,780
would be to have a battle-tested
fire house in the neighborhood.

334
02:04:00,110 --> 02:04:02,280
Ohhhh!

335
02:04:04,860 --> 02:04:07,909
Well, did ya'll here the news?

336
02:04:07,910 --> 02:04:10,589
Cash bought the property
and gave it to us.

337
02:04:10,590 --> 02:04:13,760
For keeps? For keeps! Ahhhh!

338
02:04:14,280 --> 02:04:17,260
See, I knew my idea would work.

339
02:04:17,660 --> 02:04:20,249
What did you say?

340
02:04:20,250 --> 02:04:22,139
Will you wash the fire truck?

341
02:04:22,140 --> 02:04:25,640
But we just washed it!

342
02:04:29,600 --> 02:04:35,480
Oh... oohh, Captain!
