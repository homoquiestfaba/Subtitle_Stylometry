evening at a soup kitchen,

864
00:58:17,565 --> 00:58:19,433
feeding meals to the homeless?

865
00:58:19,533 --> 00:58:23,904
[sighing] It feels so amazing

866
00:58:24,005 --> 00:58:26,874
to make such a difference
in people's lives.

867
00:58:27,808 --> 00:58:30,745
I mean, if you could just
see the look in their eyes,

868
00:58:31,012 --> 00:58:32,747
just one time,

869
00:58:35,616 --> 00:58:38,986
you would know why I do this.
[crying]

870
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:44,191
Amen, not just anybody
could do the things

871
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:48,362
that Debra does,
you must be very proud, Todd.

872
00:58:48,929 --> 00:58:54,101
- She is certainly amazing.
- Mm.

873
00:58:55,636 --> 00:58:58,105
[Braeden choking]

874
00:58:58,205 --> 00:59:03,044
Sorry, just a little
something in my throat.

875
00:59:03,144 --> 00:59:05,112
[Todd] Must be all that gravy,
huh guy?

876
00:59:05,212 --> 00:59:09,316
[Todd and Debra laughing]

877
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:12,153
It certainly is
unusual for a friend

878
00:59:12,253 --> 00:59:14,121
that no one's ever met before

879
00:59:14,789 --> 00:59:17,258
to be invited to
a family gathering,

880
00:59:17,658 --> 00:59:21,595
especially a holiday
family gathering.

881
00:59:22,329 --> 00:59:24,131
Oh Mom, If Nicole wants to have

882
00:59:24,231 --> 00:59:25,766
a friend over for dinner,
just let her.

883
00:59:26,133 --> 00:59:29,003
Jesus, thanks for
granting me permission

884
00:59:29,103 --> 00:59:32,006
to have my friend over to
my house for the dinner I made.

885
00:59:32,106 --> 00:59:33,374
Oh, you're welcome.

886
00:59:33,474 --> 00:59:34,909
Oh yeah Nicole,
this is a great idea.

887
00:59:35,009 --> 00:59:36,710
What could possibly go wrong?

888
00:59:36,811 --> 00:59:39,213
Now, now,
Jake, it's quite all right.

889
00:59:39,313 --> 00:59:42,450
We're all accustomed
to Nicole's behavior.

890
00:59:43,217 --> 00:59:46,854
It's typical of Nicole
to think only of herself.

891
00:59:47,455 --> 00:59:49,558
Her behavior sometimes hurts us,

892
00:59:49,657 --> 00:59:51,492
but we deal with
it the best we can,

893
00:59:51,592 --> 00:59:55,196
because well, we care about her.

894
00:59:55,663 --> 00:59:57,231
Yeah, we do.

895
01:00:00,569 --> 01:00:02,537
So Jake, all in all,

896
01:00:02,636 --> 01:00:05,306
I'd say that you've
been really quiet tonight.

897
01:00:05,806 --> 01:00:07,308
How's everything with you?

898
01:00:09,176 --> 01:00:10,678
- Jake?
- What?

899
01:00:12,279 --> 01:00:14,115
Fine, fine, thank you.

900
01:00:15,249 --> 01:00:17,218
Well, did you know
that Todd's been traveling

901
01:00:17,318 --> 01:00:20,454
a lot for his job?
He's been a real jet setter.

902
01:00:20,555 --> 01:00:21,889
[Debra and Todd laughing]

903
01:00:21,989 --> 01:00:26,827
Jake and I are divorced.
[Debra gasping]

904
01:00:27,862 --> 01:00:30,397
- What?
- Oh my Lord.

905
01:00:32,633 --> 01:00:34,735
What are you saying, Nicole?

906
01:00:35,269 --> 01:00:38,507
What I'm saying Mother,
is I divorced Jake.

907
01:00:38,607 --> 01:00:39,874
I'm no longer married to him.

908
01:00:39,974 --> 01:00:41,475
He does not live in this house.

909
01:00:41,576 --> 01:00:43,711
I am a single woman
living my life.

910
01:00:43,811 --> 01:00:47,948
Well, this is quite a surprise,

911
01:00:48,849 --> 01:00:50,784
but I can't say that
I'm completely shocked

912
01:00:50,885 --> 01:00:53,287
that you were unable
to keep a man.

913
01:00:53,588 --> 01:00:54,855
You were never
very good at keeping

914
01:00:54,955 --> 01:00:56,657
much of anything together.

915
01:00:57,124 --> 01:00:59,528
I mean, it's any wonder
that you've managed

916
01:00:59,628 --> 01:01:01,762
to keep a job all of this time.

917
01:01:02,363 --> 01:01:03,797
Now Mother,

918
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:10,137
let's just placate Nicole,
like we always do,

919
01:01:10,237 --> 01:01:13,240
and we'll deal with this later.
[chuckling]

920
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:14,609
- Yes.
- Yeah.

921
01:01:15,009 --> 01:01:19,013
Far be it for me to
ruin a family gathering.

922
01:01:20,481 --> 01:01:23,817
Let's just move
on with this meal,

923
01:01:24,785 --> 01:01:26,287
and we'll talk about this later.

924
01:01:26,387 --> 01:01:28,523
Okay.

925
01:01:28,822 --> 01:01:31,560
[silverware scraping]

926
01:01:31,825 --> 01:01:35,763
So then Braeden,
what is it that you do?

927
01:01:37,998 --> 01:01:40,367
- Well...
- Braeden's a serial killer.

928
01:01:45,739 --> 01:01:49,944
[Todd]
He's a, a killer?

929
01:01:50,512 --> 01:01:52,479
A killer what?

930
01:01:55,015 --> 01:01:56,817
Literally, he's a killer.

931
01:01:56,917 --> 01:01:58,919
He kills people
and gets away with it.

932
01:01:59,019 --> 01:02:01,623
And my adoring wife here
thought it'd be a great idea

933
01:02:01,722 --> 01:02:03,090
to have him in our house.

934
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:07,662
- Ex-wife, my house.
- Ah right, sorry honey.

935
01:02:07,761 --> 01:02:10,565
My adoring ex-wife thought
it'd be a great idea

936
01:02:10,665 --> 01:02:14,134
to have a serial
killer in her house.

937
01:02:14,802 --> 01:02:17,171
So who do you kill,

938
01:02:17,271 --> 01:02:20,407
like prostitutes or something?
[laughing]

939
01:02:20,508 --> 01:02:22,843
- Honey.
- I'm sorry.

940
01:02:27,348 --> 01:02:31,720
[chuckling] No, I,
I don't kill prostitutes.

941
01:02:32,286 --> 01:02:34,689
They have a hard
enough life as it is.

942
01:02:34,989 --> 01:02:37,659
Okay, I'm sorry,
but isn't the real question

943
01:02:37,791 --> 01:02:39,193
we should be asking
ourselves here is,

944
01:02:39,293 --> 01:02:40,928
what are we gonna
do about the fact

945
01:02:41,028 --> 01:02:42,763
that there's a
goddamn serial killer

946
01:02:42,863 --> 01:02:44,832
sitting at the dinner table?

947
01:02:46,333 --> 01:02:51,872
Okay, Nicole I know I
said we'd deal with this later,

948
01:02:51,972 --> 01:02:55,543
but we have a broken family now.

949
01:02:56,377 --> 01:02:59,614
Why didn't you tell us
that you were getting a divorce?

950
01:02:59,714 --> 01:03:04,552
I mean,
this is just so like you.

951
01:03:04,653 --> 01:03:07,589
So, how many people
have you killed?

952
01:03:07,689 --> 01:03:10,257
Really, that's the question?

953
01:03:10,525 --> 01:03:13,794
You don't ask,
I don't know, how I'm doing?

954
01:03:13,994 --> 01:03:16,797
You don't say, "I'm sorry
your marriage fell apart."

955
01:03:16,897 --> 01:03:19,099
You don't ask, "What happened?"

956
01:03:20,067 --> 01:03:22,336
You know,
I take of fence to that question.

957
01:03:23,672 --> 01:03:25,740
You wouldn't ask a soldier
who's just come back from war

958
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:28,342
how many people he's killed,
would you?

959
01:03:28,743 --> 01:03:31,111
You know it it's,
it's typical Nicole.

960
01:03:31,412 --> 01:03:34,882
Your sister asks you a question,
and what do you do?

961
01:03:34,982 --> 01:03:38,553
You just turn it around
and make it all about you.

962
01:03:39,486 --> 01:03:41,288
I pray one day you grow up.

963
01:03:41,388 --> 01:03:43,692
I, I, I just,
I have to say something here.

964
01:03:43,792 --> 01:03:45,694
You know,
my father and grandfather

965
01:03:45,794 --> 01:03:47,861
both fought for this
country to give us both

966
01:03:47,961 --> 01:03:49,631
the freedoms that
we enjoy today.

967
01:03:49,731 --> 01:03:50,931
It's the reason
you have the freedom

968
01:03:51,031 --> 01:03:52,333
to go around killing people.

969
01:03:52,433 --> 01:03:54,201
And I'll be damned
if I'm gonna sit here

970
01:03:54,301 --> 01:03:55,869
and let you talk about
the troops that way.

971
01:03:55,969 --> 01:03:58,072
Jake, sit down.

972
01:04:06,447 --> 01:04:10,217
[chuckling] You're
not even married anymore,

973
01:04:10,317 --> 01:04:11,852
why are you listening to her?

974
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:16,090
For that matter,
I mean, why are you even here?

975
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:18,292
- Why am I even here?
- Hmm.

976
01:04:18,392 --> 01:04:21,128
Why didn't you ask why
there's a serial killer here?

977
01:04:21,228 --> 01:04:22,697
You know, I wasn't
literally comparing myself

978
01:04:22,797 --> 01:04:24,198
to a soldier, by the way.

979
01:04:24,298 --> 01:04:27,000
I was just saying,
like they might take of fence

980
01:04:27,101 --> 01:04:28,770
to that type of question.

981
01:04:28,869 --> 01:04:30,572
I'm sorry.

982
01:04:35,342 --> 01:04:41,549
Well then Braeden,
what was your childhood like?

983
01:04:41,649 --> 01:04:43,050
[Nicole chuckling]

984
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:44,985
Oh, well your laughter
is quite inappropriate.

985
01:04:45,085 --> 01:04:47,221
It's a completely
legitimate question.

986
01:04:47,321 --> 01:04:49,824
For instance,
if Braeden were to say

987
01:04:49,923 --> 01:04:52,527
that he came from a,
a broken home,

988
01:04:52,627 --> 01:04:54,662
or perhaps he was adopted,

989
01:04:55,095 --> 01:04:58,666
you might understand
why he is the way he is,

990
01:04:58,767 --> 01:05:04,138
a, a killer,
as Jake describes him.

991
01:05:04,238 --> 01:05:07,675
You can really talk
some shit, mother.

992
01:05:07,776 --> 01:05:10,911
It's like a laxative made
shit come outta your mouth.

993
01:05:11,011 --> 01:05:13,280
- Honestly, Nicole.
- Nicole.

994
01:05:13,914 --> 01:05:16,684
[Todd] So why
do you kill people?

995
01:05:16,785 --> 01:05:19,420
I'm, I'm sorry,
is that okay to ask?

996
01:05:19,953 --> 01:05:23,023
Yeah, yeah it's, it's fine.

997
01:05:24,626 --> 01:05:26,528
[sighing]

998
01:05:28,061 --> 01:05:30,197
I, I don't really know.

999
01:05:31,766 --> 01:05:34,468
Don't you think,
surely there must be

1000
01:05:34,569 --> 01:05:36,638
some kind of a reason?

1001
01:05:38,372 --> 01:05:42,744
Probably,
but who can afford therapy?

1002
01:05:42,976 --> 01:05:45,078
And by the way,
did you ask if he was adopted,

1003
01:05:45,179 --> 01:05:46,848
'cause Christ,
he should be so lucky.

1004
01:05:46,947 --> 01:05:51,452
- Nicole, don't say that.
- No, no, that's okay.

1005
01:05:52,687 --> 01:05:57,057
Nicole has never been very
grateful for my many sacrifices.

1006
01:05:59,661 --> 01:06:02,897
So how do you kill them?

1007
01:06:02,996 --> 01:06:07,367
Are you a shooter,

1008
01:06:07,602 --> 01:06:09,737
a drowner,

1009
01:06:11,205 --> 01:06:15,976
a strangler, stabber,

1010
01:06:16,778 --> 01:06:18,178
a...

1011
01:06:21,415 --> 01:06:22,550
cannibalizer?

1012
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:25,118
You know, since this
dinner has become a forum

1013
01:06:25,219 --> 01:06:27,589
of brutal honesty,
let me tell you Todd,

1014
01:06:27,689 --> 01:06:29,056
I have never liked you.

1015
01:06:29,156 --> 01:06:32,493
You're the dumbest motherfucker.

1016
01:06:32,594 --> 01:06:36,764
Well, one of the dumbest
motherfuckers anyway,

1017
01:06:37,632 --> 01:06:39,366
and you're a creep ball.

1018
01:06:39,801 --> 01:06:42,302
You're the kinda guy that
would go up to a girl in the bar

1019
01:06:42,402 --> 01:06:45,272
and be like,
"Hey, is your daddy a baker?

1020
01:06:45,372 --> 01:06:47,575
'Cause you got
a great set of buns,"

1021
01:06:47,675 --> 01:06:49,844
and think you're super cool.

1022
01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:52,179
You're the kind
of guy that mothers

1023
01:06:52,279 --> 01:06:55,583
would call the police on if
they saw you near a playground.

1024
01:06:55,683 --> 01:06:58,252
Of course my sister here
is rather creepy herself.

1025
01:06:58,352 --> 01:07:00,522
Maybe in a different
sort of way,

1026
01:07:00,622 --> 01:07:04,491
but I guess that's why you
two are, [giggling] so in love.

1027
01:07:09,496 --> 01:07:11,164
Wow.

1028
01:07:12,032 --> 01:07:14,167
[Debra]
How could you say this, Nicole?

1029
01:07:15,870 --> 01:07:19,106
Todd is a good man.

1030
01:07:20,675 --> 01:07:25,178
He buys me flowers,
he rubs my feet, he...

1031
01:07:25,279 --> 01:07:27,414
I water the flowers
that I buy for her.

1032
01:07:27,515 --> 01:07:30,384
Yeah, he waters the
flowers that he buys for me.

1033
