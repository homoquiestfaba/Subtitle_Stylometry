Senator, there is a lot of speculations about
of who you might to pick for your running mate

22
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,037
and most correspondent believe that your selection may be
Chip Majors

00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,242
The Governor of Louisiana

24
00:01:20,699 --> 00:01:21,654

100s and 20s

29
00:01:30,075 --> 00:01:34,296
Do not you think we should hurry
before the right people should be notified?

30
00:01:34,513 --> 00:01:35,537
The director had been made aware.

31
00:01:35,848 --> 00:01:39,693
The intell had a clue with the Vice briefing this
morning.
-The Governor know?

Chip is a good friends.

39
00:02:13,385 --> 00:02:16,730
But I'm not really ready to say whether he will be
my choice

40
00:02:16,922 --> 00:02:17,707
right now.

41
00:02:18,157 --> 00:02:20,330
But what I can say is that he is a
good man

42
00:02:21,093 --> 00:02:22,799
And that is a man of integrity

43
00:02:22,828 --> 00:02:23,305
and character

44
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:26,218
And he will be nothing but the asset
in this campaign.

45
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:02,254

50
00:03:12,344 --> 00:03:13,368
Yes, but I'm your sister

51
00:03:13,746 --> 00:03:16,647

for your phone

52
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,589

I blow your phone like that.

56
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,907
Remember when I told you that Pat and I
were in the house?

57
00:03:28,327 --> 00:03:30,818

58
00:03:31,363 --> 00:03:32,330

00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,441

00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:03,269
I really need get back to the work, ok?

68
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:05,619
But I'll be off after 6

69
00:04:05,631 --> 00:04:07,087

70
00:04:08,634 --> 00:04:09,771
Is That's it?

71
00:04:11,971 --> 00:04:13,461
What, did you cheat again?

72
00:04:13,472 --> 00:04:14,655
NO !!...

73
00:04:15,574 --> 00:04:17,508
Yes, but it's not it.

74
00:04:19,678 --> 00:04:20,406
Hey, what is it?

75
00:04:23,248 --> 00:04:23,896
Nothing...don’t worry

76
00:04:26,251 --> 00:04:27,980
Actually ... . I got to go.

77
00:04:32,758 --> 00:04:35,545
They found a lump in my breast, Devon
and I'm scared.

78
00:04:37,963 --> 00:04:39,908
We don't have any insurance now ...
I do not know...

79
00:04:44,303 --> 00:04:45,292
It's gonna be okay.

80
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:46,269
It's gonna be alright.

81
00:04:46,438 --> 00:04:47,598
We will take care of everything ...

82
00:04:53,445 --> 00:04:54,173
Look's ...

83
00:04:55,214 --> 00:04:57,182

I promise ok.

84
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,480
Devon, you're always so good.

85
00:05:02,755 --> 00:05:03,392
I love you, sister.

86
00:05:13,032 --> 00:05:14,909
Again, as always they say,

87
00:05:15,134 --> 00:05:19,173
Leave to the commonsense people of the
great state of Louisiana to gave rights

88
00:05:22,107 --> 00:05:23,415
That's right..look ...

89
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:27,615
I know what critics are saying.

90
00:05:27,713 --> 00:05:31,649
I am sure drilling not end all to answer
to the American energy power

91
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,207
But friends

92
00:05:32,584 --> 00:05:33,539
We got do something. .

93
00:05:35,521 --> 00:05:36,533
And I'm very proud to say

94
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:38,454
It was for many years

95
00:05:38,524 --> 00:05:41,118
Our state has been the pioneer in
out shore drilling

96
00:05:41,894 --> 00:05:42,861
and this nation

97
00:05:43,228 --> 00:05:46,709
depends on all natural gas that we provide.

98
00:05:48,534 --> 00:05:49,546
and it's enough.

99
00:05:49,768 --> 00:05:51,269
and I mean enough ...

100
00:05:52,037 --> 00:05:54,460
they can bring me great pleasure this moment

101
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,159
that standing next to one of the
greatest all man of our century.

102
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,394
Jethro Tibbons

103
00:06:02,381 --> 00:06:04,087
So without further to do

104
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:05,889
on behalf of the people of this state

105
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,358
I will drill the first hole thru the
100 million dollar a platform

106
00:06:11,857 --> 00:06:13,654
that extends 690 feat

107
00:06:16,962 --> 00:06:18,998
and weighs 8700 tons

108
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:25,205
and will drink of our reserve of 50 million barrels
of oil from the beneath of the Gulf of Mexico.

109
00:06:29,274 --> 00:06:30,946

at the top of Senator Edmond shortlist for the vice

United States

Thank you

127
00:07:31,737 --> 00:07:34,979

00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,003

132
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,546
I am busy.

133
00:07:52,925 --> 00:07:54,096
Now you Want to talk about something?

134
00:07:54,293 --> 00:07:57,842
Why don't we talk about the soar of
unemployment in this country?

135
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:01,506
Why don't we talk about Americans
without health care?

136
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:05,701
Why don't we talk about roads and bridges
that need to be built in this country?

137
00:08:06,371 --> 00:08:08,384
What wee have to do for this country?

138
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,177
right now.

139
00:08:09,341 --> 00:08:10,319
Let's talk about that!

140
00:08:10,609 --> 00:08:16,787
Can We talk about the failed energy policies
of your party, because of cosy relationships
with Big Oil?

141
00:08:16,915 --> 00:08:18,689
that costing this nation dully?

142
00:08:20,852 --> 00:08:23,059
Well Gretna, I am sorry you feel that way

143
00:08:23,655 --> 00:08:26,442
but we believe those taxes got worth.

144
00:08:26,892 --> 00:08:29,725
as you cannot taxes the business owners

145
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:32,367
without expecting some tripple down  effect of the fall
household's.

146
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:39,245
So you would rather this country shrinking
middle class shoulders the taxes burden.

147
00:08:39,404 --> 00:08:40,712
What about the deficit?

148
00:08:40,772 --> 00:08:41,898
That is all time high

149
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,751
What about the national debt that gonna pass down
to my grandkids

150
00:08:47,913 --> 00:08:49,062
It is no secret

151
00:08:49,214 --> 00:08:50,920
that we are facing some challenges

152
00:08:51,783 --> 00:08:53,319
But we have the plan

153
00:08:53,986 --> 00:08:56,147
to dress the concern of all American’s

154
00:08:56,622 --> 00:08:58,715
And we will march to Washington

155
00:08:59,191 --> 00:09:00,579
And we will get thing done

156
00:09:01,326 --> 00:09:03,089
I believe Americans want a change

157
00:09:03,662 --> 00:09:05,243
And I'm the man to deliver it.

158
00:09:05,897 --> 00:09:07,671
How can you say that will change things

159
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:10,775
with over 150 lobbies in your campaign?

160
00:09:11,303 --> 00:09:12,133
Gretna

161
00:09:12,704 --> 00:09:15,366
All these people take a leave of absences’

162
00:09:15,707 --> 00:09:16,366
to work for me

163
00:09:16,575 --> 00:09:17,826
How cute! a lobbies, is a lobbies, is a lobbies

164
00:09:20,646 --> 00:09:22,623
The is the first rule of the Capital Hill.

165
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:24,367
Well, I bet it's different.

166
00:09:25,317 --> 00:09:26,477
See, what I believe... is that

167
00:09:26,752 --> 00:09:29,710
Americans want and need

168
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:32,016
Someone who understands their pains.

169
00:09:33,325 --> 00:09:34,599
Someone who can relate

170
00:09:35,794 --> 00:09:38,297
Not only that, someone who has the courage

171
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,497
to lead them.

172
00:09:39,831 --> 00:09:41,981
Stand up for them ...
and fight for them.

173
00:09:42,868 --> 00:09:43,357
Senator ...

174
00:09:43,702 --> 00:09:44,441
you can relate

175
00:09:44,603 --> 00:09:49,575
Forbes magazine has your net worth
estimated at over 100 million dollar,

176
00:09:50,175 --> 00:09:52,507
How can you relate the working class
American?

177
00:09:52,911 --> 00:09:56,688
We'll let the Senator answer the question
when we come back after this break..
GOT TO PAY SOME BILLS. .

178
00:10:10,162 --> 00:10:10,912
That's an order, sir?

179
00:10:11,196 --> 00:10:11,855

and that's what the discussion is all about

189
00:10:33,151 --> 00:10:35,540
It is cheaper to hit with the taxes break

190
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:38,931

I need some info.

451
00:27:00,438 --> 00:27:02,611
What did i am telling you about
calling me in the phone

452
00:27:02,907 --> 00:27:05,922
and ask me things that I can't tell you.

453
00:27:06,344 --> 00:27:08,949
Gloria, please. You know I wont ask if

00:27:21,325 --> 00:27:23,077
It ,s about Majors.

457
00:27:23,994 --> 00:27:24,574
The Governor?

458
00:27:26,097 --> 00:27:27,746

459
00:27:27,832 --> 00:27:30,847
Come on, baby ... you know everybody.
I need some help.

00:27:32,636 --> 00:27:34,649
Are you calling me from the state itself?

461
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:35,862

462
00:27:36,273 --> 00:27:37,308

463
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:39,045
I will call you from the another life.

464
00:27:53,891 --> 00:27:54,812
Yes, baby doll.

465
00:27:55,326 --> 00:27:56,759
Why I always fall with your charms?

466
00:27:57,561 --> 00:27:59,097
Because you still love a Daddy.

467
00:28:00,131 --> 00:28:02,395
I need to make another
appointment with my therapist.

468
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:05,770

okay i can get kill for what
I am gonna tell you

470
00:28:14,612 --> 00:28:15,806
But I never told you, right?

471
00:28:18,149 --> 00:28:19,832
Majors was never CIA.

472
00:28:20,184 --> 00:28:21,731
but high ranking NSA.

473
00:28:22,086 --> 00:28:23,519
And guess what the area focus was

474
00:28:24,155 --> 00:28:25,031
Afghanistan?

475
00:28:26,023 --> 00:28:27,138
No, Pakistan.

476
00:28:27,758 --> 00:28:28,543
That's all I know.

477
00:28:28,926 --> 00:28:31,372
Listen Thomas, Please, be careful.

478
00:28:33,497 --> 00:28:34,907
I have to go, I got a phone to lock.

479
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:35,951
Hey, baby doll

480
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,607
I miss you.

481
00:28:39,437 --> 00:28:41,917
you just make sure the check on time

482
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,178
She hot on me.

483
00:28:51,849 --> 00:28:52,702
and good to me.

484
00:28:55,186 --> 00:28:59,725
Senator, I would like to switch our focus now,
possible to more domestic issues campaign finance

485
00:29:00,191 --> 00:29:03,217
I must admit, you are very effective in this area

486
00:29:03,527 --> 00:29:07,452
Cross the isle with some great compas,
must get reform legislation path.

487
00:29:08,365 --> 00:29:09,286
Well Thank you, Gretna.

488
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:13,098
Actually I'm very proud of that. We
worked very hard

489
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:17,227
to adhere to the principles that we
committed to ..concerning

490
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:21,697
make contributions and the
special entries.

491
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:24,035
Compromised into the electoral process

492
00:29:24,815 --> 00:29:25,941
of course

493
00:29:26,283 --> 00:29:28,069
As always we meet a lot of resistance
in Washington.

494
00:29:30,554 --> 00:29:31,293
but

495
00:29:31,288 --> 00:29:32,232
we got a gun

496
00:29:32,923 --> 00:29:33,867
and

497
00:29:33,891 --> 00:29:35,074
my leadership

498
00:29:35,626 --> 00:29:37,491
was instrumental in getting it done.

499
00:29:38,128 --> 00:29:41,427
and the last tab, I believe that I play demonstrate as
a president of United States.

500
00:29:42,099 --> 00:29:43,748
but one quick question, if you do not mind.

501
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:46,696
Your opponents been openly critical about
your's in this issue.

502
00:29:47,037 --> 00:29:53,124
he said and I quote Senator Edmond  is not being
straight with the  American people about campaign
financing lupus''

503
00:29:53,711 --> 00:29:54,587
what are you say about this?

504
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,441
Well, that's exactly the type of politics that
we run.. from

505
00:30:01,018 --> 00:30:05,671
you see ...  it same old, same old Washington,
Pardington bickering  ...

506
00:30:06,423 --> 00:30:07,720
and finger point. .

507
00:30:08,993 --> 00:30:13,214
See, they don't want to talk about the other side.
What they don't want to talk about

508
00:30:13,531 --> 00:30:15,431
is how they gonna raise
our taxes.

509
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,149
make the government bigger

510
00:30:17,868 --> 00:30:19,904
when it should be smaller

511
00:30:20,371 --> 00:30:21,167
and more responsible.

512
00:30:21,372 --> 00:30:27,811
Well, have they been less hand off smaller government
during the morgues crisis may be we wouldn’t be
in recession right now.

513
00:30:28,212 --> 00:30:34,276
but more importantly, Senator, before we get
off track, there is lot talk about Article 527
in the tax code.

514
00:30:34,685 --> 00:30:38,917
that gonna allow organizations and foundations
to raise unlimited money

515
00:30:39,156 --> 00:30:41,670
and campaigning for whatever issue they chose
that's like they switch both better

516
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:44,048
against Shawn Kerry

517
00:30:44,962 --> 00:30:47,874
Now, our sources are estimated that leadership
for American fund has tab

518
00:30:48,165 --> 00:30:52,249
a sum of 35 million dollar that will be used
campaigning against your opponents

519
00:30:54,171 --> 00:30:56,469
and a your convention host committee

520
00:30:56,707 --> 00:30:57,969
has also raise a tons of cash

521
00:30:58,242 --> 00:31:00,915
and all this is outside the
campaign finance boundaries

522
00:31:01,078 --> 00:31:03,171
imposed by your legislation in Congress.

523
00:31:03,547 --> 00:31:04,821
Is that a lupo, Senator?

524
00:31:05,082 --> 00:31:06,288
is that what your
Opponents talking about?

525
00:31:06,617 --> 00:31:07,845
Gretna, the first and for most ...
We have not broken any laws

526
00:31:09,553 --> 00:31:13,091
and will continue to open our honest
to these of Americans people.

527
00:31:13,757 --> 00:31:14,394
trust me, Gretna.

528
00:31:14,758 --> 00:31:15,599
Trust me.

529
00:31:16,293 --> 00:31:17,999
I literally wrote that law.

530
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:20,463
How can you talk so
freely about changes

531
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:21,765
when it's just more the same.

532
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:23,857
same of player, same of game and rhetoric’s

533
00:31:24,101 --> 00:31:27,923
isn't it all just the smoke screen
the rich can get richer

534
00:31:28,238 --> 00:31:28,943
and the poor can stay regret.

535
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,428
and I mean, how's big is the gap between
the have and have not?
-Oh boy...

536
00:31:33,877 --> 00:31:36,687
and who was paying those lobbies, before they
starting working for you?

537
00:31:37,815 --> 00:31:40,010
and why did they choose to work for you?

538
00:31:40,618 --> 00:31:43,200
But it does make sense somebody need
to serve your drinks

539
00:31:43,621 --> 00:31:45,179
and clean your big houses.
-you know what, you better need to hang those...
we can spent a lot of times.

tough questions.

I will be calling your boss, you liar.

542
00:31:57,735 --> 00:32:01,068
You want your big government to fix's every
problems in your life.

543
00:32:01,472 --> 00:32:04,020
That's why we have third generations welfare families

544
00:32:04,408 --> 00:32:08,720
and how about 40 million babies that you
prochoice that a chance of life you stupid bitch?

545
00:32:09,146 --> 00:32:12,912
This man will be the next

Maam, My mama taught me when commonsense.

551
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:35,611
two things that don’t go together
are oil and water.

552
00:32:36,807 --> 00:32:39,264
must be nice to drop 200 million on a piece of steel.

553
00:32:40,778 --> 00:32:42,291
I wonder if they need a bodyguard.

554
00:32:42,713 --> 00:32:44,203

my college loans.

00:43:15,378 --> 00:43:15,855
I was the owner.

706
00:43:16,046 --> 00:43:18,048
I bet you did not know, don't you?

707
00:43:18,081 --> 00:43:19,548
No, sorry. Still can not enter
in the room.

708
00:43:20,016 --> 00:43:23,349
do you have any idea who sent the girl
was with the governor this evening?

709
00:43:24,454 --> 00:43:26,433
Don't you see that man look at me?

710
00:43:26,823 --> 00:43:28,586
Maam, I am just here for security.

711
00:43:28,591 --> 00:43:29,523
Please go and have good time.

712
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,727
Unbelievable!

713
00:43:44,007 --> 00:43:45,713
my goodness sweepea ...

714
00:43:45,742 --> 00:43:48,370
I thought you'd gone swallow up by the toilet bowl in there
.

715
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:51,984
Oh, you worry about me. That's so cute.

716
00:43:58,021 --> 00:44:02,242
Now, I just love that Harrison Ford at the Air force
One, there is no movie like that anymore.

717
00:44:02,859 --> 00:44:08,820
I hear you, but it's like 50 people got
killed in that movie. It's too much violence for me

718
00:44:09,332 --> 00:44:11,311
it's Only a movie.

719
00:44:11,468 --> 00:44:12,617
I know,

720
00:44:12,736 --> 00:44:16,991
but still i mean don't you think it can't
going happen worries me
that can happen ...

721
00:44:17,006 --> 00:44:18,576
It's too much violence.

722
00:44:19,709 --> 00:44:22,086
You can not expect the movie industries to raise your
children.

723
00:44:22,112 --> 00:44:25,832
You have to decide if you wants and if doesn't want to
It is not our responsibility

724
00:44:25,915 --> 00:44:26,711
Of course not.

725
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:29,259
What about all those murders taking place, eh?

726
00:44:29,786 --> 00:44:30,696
I mean. .

727
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,280
what ensures that the violence of Hollywood
not going to hurt.

728
00:44:33,723 --> 00:44:35,281
Well, Son, you have to concurred.

729
00:44:35,258 --> 00:44:37,328
There are bad guys doing bad things.

730
00:44:37,961 --> 00:44:39,701
that can kill by the good guy, for a
good cause.

731
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:42,739
With all due respect, governor.

732
00:44:42,866 --> 00:44:45,926
Killing is not always the best way to promote good
cause.

733
00:44:46,069 --> 00:44:48,003
Yes, but sometimes it's the only way.

734
00:44:49,139 --> 00:44:51,767
Well, we just have agree and disagree that's all.

735
00:44:52,242 --> 00:44:53,345
Mr.Governor,

736
00:44:53,343 --> 00:44:53,957
are you Okay?

737
00:44:55,278 --> 00:44:57,599
If you'll excuse me, I need to drink water.

738
00:45:02,452 --> 00:45:05,068
Do not waste your time entertaining some fools.

739
00:45:05,088 --> 00:45:06,362
makes no sense.

740
00:45:06,389 --> 00:45:09,802
It is a waste of time to explain what is good and
what is bad.

741
00:45:10,226 --> 00:45:11,705
My husband always hated him.

742
00:45:11,961 --> 00:45:14,498
Yes, but are separated by years.

743
00:45:14,731 --> 00:45:17,689
yes, but be surprised seeing me near you

744
00:45:18,067 --> 00:45:22,800
Well, I understand it the throats cut level by
Hurricane get sugar cane and cane no more

745
00:45:29,646 --> 00:45:32,626
My husband always knew how to deal with all this
stakes competition.

746
00:45:34,217 --> 00:45:35,491
How about your wife, Governor?

747
00:45:35,485 --> 00:45:37,339
She can handle a little competition?

748
00:45:39,889 --> 00:45:41,584
If you'll excuse me.

749
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,203
Violence also is in the Bible too, right?

750
00:45:46,496 --> 00:45:47,906
Come on, wait a minute,
you can not compare

751
00:45:48,631 --> 00:45:50,940
violence and violence ...
Gentlemen, gentlemen

752
00:45:51,134 --> 00:45:52,726
This is a cocktail party.

753
00:45:53,636 --> 00:45:55,547
Ok ...

754
00:45:55,905 --> 00:45:57,395
Governor, can I have a quick words with u?
absolutely ...

755
00:45:58,341 --> 00:46:01,890
But I will not be alone there so much violence in
films.

756
00:46:02,412 --> 00:46:03,720
It was disappointing.

757
00:46:04,314 --> 00:46:04,917
Now ...

758
00:46:05,515 --> 00:46:09,963
Look, I just wanted to apologize for not contributing
more to your leadership for the American Foundation
leaders

759
00:46:10,453 --> 00:46:11,056
just ...

760
00:46:12,355 --> 00:46:14,767
it's just one though year.

761
00:46:14,791 --> 00:46:15,906
I know, Moe ...

762
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:16,989
You are doing the best you could.

763
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:21,315
Everyone ...

764
00:46:21,764 --> 00:46:23,322
Can I have your attention please?

765
00:46:23,433 --> 00:46:24,274
A toast.

766
00:46:24,734 --> 00:46:26,463
The governor would like to say a few words.

767
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:28,716
Ladies and gentlemen ...

768
00:46:29,572 --> 00:46:30,721
I want to thank you all for coming.

769
00:46:31,541 --> 00:46:32,849
I wanted this to be a

770
00:46:33,276 --> 00:46:33,935
small....

771
00:46:34,677 --> 00:46:35,507
intimate gather.

772
00:46:35,879 --> 00:46:37,119
My greatest support.

773
00:46:39,349 --> 00:46:40,498
You know, 19 months ago ...

774
00:46:40,783 --> 00:46:43,160
A young farmer boy from the
North Carolina villas

775
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:45,378
set out to change this country.

776
00:46:46,589 --> 00:46:47,726
And he doing so

777
00:46:48,124 --> 00:46:49,660
Let's change the world ...

778
00:46:51,094 --> 00:46:51,935
I'm praying. .

779
00:46:52,629 --> 00:46:53,482
privately, of course.

780
00:46:55,598 --> 00:46:56,713
In the next few days

781
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,668
I will get a phone call to joint him in the journey

782
00:47:01,271 --> 00:47:02,738
and I'll take you all with me.

783
00:47:04,974 --> 00:47:06,589
I want to thank you for believing me.

784
00:47:07,477 --> 00:47:09,206
my values and integrity ...

785
00:47:10,246 --> 00:47:13,852
Some are so good down home at their place of origin
could lead this nation.

786
00:47:15,218 --> 00:47:16,128
So ...

787
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:17,416
I would like to propose a toast ...

788
00:47:18,955 --> 00:47:22,561

friendship and partnerships ...

789
00:47:23,426 --> 00:47:24,427

790
00:47:24,694 --> 00:47:25,820
to a new America ...

791
00:47:27,797 --> 00:47:28,923

792
00:47:37,106 --> 00:47:38,562

3rd floor parking garage ... the northwest corner. .

804
00:48:02,565 --> 00:48:03,850
Shut the fuck up ...

805
00:48:39,936 --> 00:48:42,086
You are too pretty to be a cop.

806
00:48:44,007 --> 00:48:46,817
I always want to mix business with pleasure. .

807
00:48:48,077 --> 00:48:49,715
Why not try my first ...

808
00:48:50,446 --> 00:48:52,858
Chocolate Pudding ... if
you know what I mean.

809
00:48:54,317 --> 00:48:58,094
You know? You remind me of a Black Spice Girl...

810
00:48:58,287 --> 00:48:59,561
You know, the black one...

811
00:49:03,259 --> 00:49:05,466
She looks so delicious. .

00:49:08,598 --> 00:49:10,361
so preety ...

813
00:49:10,833 --> 00:49:12,164
Solid ...

814
00:49:12,669 --> 00:49:14,261
but hard inside ...

815
00:49:19,609 --> 00:49:20,906
thirsty ...

816
00:49:21,711 --> 00:49:23,770
so thirsty for power ...

817
00:49:26,082 --> 00:49:28,858
You're so thirsty for power, you ...

818
00:49:29,952 --> 00:49:32,125
you left your self in a defenceless position ...

819
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:36,996
Do you ike my English?

820
00:49:37,927 --> 00:49:39,371
I learned in prison.

821
00:49:42,031 --> 00:49:44,431
just like you, Americans ...

822
00:49:44,667 --> 00:49:47,215
Borrowing the money from the Chinese.

823
00:49:47,403 --> 00:49:50,258
so you can buy your
fury of your enemies ...

824
00:49:53,509 --> 00:49:56,091
your enemies bought of your friends

825
00:50:02,051 --> 00:50:04,372
you making them stronger ...

826
00:50:06,289 --> 00:50:08,860
and you leave yourself defenceless ...

827
00:50:12,462 --> 00:50:15,044
I did not know i was so clever. .

828
00:50:15,565 --> 00:50:19,467
I should have been a philosopher rather than a
mercenary soldier.

829
00:50:22,405 --> 00:50:23,747
Your, Americans. .

830
00:50:25,374 --> 00:50:26,944

831
00:50:27,143 --> 00:50:29,145
for the sin of your past.

832
00:50:29,979 --> 00:50:32,766
Just like me I have a dirty past ...

00:50:36,652 --> 00:50:37,744
do You?

835

I was trained by your country to kill

836
00:50:45,128 --> 00:50:47,562
to serve your country interests.

837
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,503
For sure I left thinking. . do you think?

838
00:51:00,576 --> 00:51:02,817

840
00:51:06,816 --> 00:51:11,059
your traffic and waiting at line for planes ...

841
00:51:13,456 --> 00:51:16,152
you have no knowledge of true suffering.

00:51:19,729 --> 00:51:21,230

846
00:51:29,338 --> 00:51:30,896

You know, I don't get it ...

00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:07,346
My life could be in danger.

859
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:11,412
and my own partner, who is supposed to
protect me was hiding something.

860
00:52:11,414 --> 00:52:13,314
Now, Devon ... What the fuck was going on?

And so what am I supposed to think?

872
00:52:37,907 --> 00:52:39,590
I can't do this.

873
00:52:40,109 --> 00:52:41,656
Devon, I need to know what is going on.

874
00:52:43,246 --> 00:52:45,441
Something really bad happened, ok?

875
00:52:46,015 --> 00:52:47,186

00:55:03,185 --> 00:55:06,769
I know tommorow is a big day,...
I need more information.

905
00:55:06,789 --> 00:55:09,565
Majors, come on ... what were they thinking?

906
00:55:09,692 --> 00:55:12,786
Can you imagine? they need at least to them
they need the new Young Voter ...that why how
we can get him

907
00:55:16,232 --> 00:55:19,941
That is a decision... gonna bite him
square in the as.

908
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:22,192
you always so exaggerated ...

909
00:55:23,706 --> 00:55:26,163
That's why I'm in intelligence agent,
not a voter ...

910
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:33,795
thank god, neither I am just let him throw him a barrier

911
00:55:36,252 --> 00:55:37,162
that’s the point. I need details ...

912
00:55:37,853 --> 00:55:40,162
I know that something play kick on it, I know it.

913
00:55:40,256 --> 00:55:41,826
I need something good.

914
00:55:42,158 --> 00:55:47,300
I love it when you get hard nose journalist
on me ...put so damm touching,

915
00:55:47,596 --> 00:55:50,474
you know i don't think my ex-husband
tought is so touching ...

916
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:56,520
It's hard time when you did away with a pure dynamical
ethic to both the professional ethics and you realize
that everything is not for everyone.

917
00:55:56,672 --> 00:55:58,094
Kumbaya!

918
00:55:59,672 --> 00:55:59,094
you ready to order

919
00:56:00,776 --> 00:56:02,516
We are still working.

920
00:56:08,317 --> 00:56:09,124
Give me your pen.

921
00:56:11,654 --> 00:56:16,444
Pakistan is trading an information on nuclear
arrangement with the North Koreans

922
00:56:16,492 --> 00:56:20,212
and exchange with missile so they can use them
on their neighbours and India

923
00:56:20,729 --> 00:56:22,970
Rumours’ has said your boys in the mix

924
00:56:23,132 --> 00:56:24,975
Okay, nothing terribly new

925
00:56:25,501 --> 00:56:26,934
Not confirmed, except ...

926
00:56:28,737 --> 00:56:29,578
someone died.

927
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:30,885
Or killed it.

928
00:56:32,775 --> 00:56:33,776
my guess... just the guess

929
00:56:34,343 --> 00:56:38,245
is that Majors

930
00:56:39,315 --> 00:56:41,408
and North Koreans, know something
the rest of us, do not it a well good untill the big
stake start it

931
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:42,685
What do you mean?

932
00:56:43,552 --> 00:56:47,249
Intelligence suggests, North Korean had a hit squad to
take Majors self.

933
00:56:49,758 --> 00:56:50,895
It's huge?

934
00:56:52,862 --> 00:56:54,022
It makes perfect sense

935
00:56:54,163 --> 00:57:00,227
do it before he becomes be nomine, all a
secret service details no find any state troops in
Louisiana.

936
00:57:00,369 --> 00:57:02,132
Why is not everyone alarmed?

937
00:57:02,805 --> 00:57:07,674
If it gets to know would travel on each we have
a troops in every corner of the nation

938
00:57:07,943 --> 00:57:09,114
haven't be confirm yet.

you sleep cosy at night

1005
01:05:59,541 --> 01:06:00,883
because of the things I've done.

1006
01:06:03,278 --> 01:06:04,529
things that needed to be done.

1007
01:06:10,285 --> 01:06:13,425
It took only three minutes to
convince you to take the money.

1008
01:06:17,159 --> 01:06:18,512

America needs what I bring to the.

01:06:32,674 --> 01:06:33,823
What America needs is honesty

1015
01:06:34,309 --> 01:06:38,507
There is too many good, decent and hardworking  people
beyond would not need a piece of shit like you

1016
01:06:39,347 --> 01:06:40,439
American people deserves the truth.

1017
01:06:43,518 --> 01:06:45,486
You know why they want to kill me?

1018
01:06:52,127 --> 01:06:53,469

1020
01:06:59,234 --> 01:07:02,055
I'm the only the Western who have laid
my eyes on that side

1021
01:07:04,473 --> 01:07:05,576
That's why they want to kill me

Why like this?

1024
01:07:22,190 --> 01:07:24,272

1026
01:07:26,561 --> 01:07:27,676
