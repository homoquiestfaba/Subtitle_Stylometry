Go on! Shoo!

183
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:33,675
Whew.

184
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,280
Just in time.

185
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:38,683
[band playing jazz]

186
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,775
Sorry.

187
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:41,046
Oh, sorry.

188
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,288
Careful.

189
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:44,589
[guests gasp]

190
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,931
Hold that.

191
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:52,295
What happened?
You're covered in shit.

192
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:53,866
It's fine! It's fine!

193
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,067
Hey, it's good
to see you, James.

194
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:59,669
You're just what I imagined
a writer to look like.

195
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:01,673
I'm surprised those stairs
don't kill anyone.

196
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:04,275
Yeah. Well, not everybody
comes in backwards.

197
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:06,608
Hey!
Hey!

198
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:08,213
So when do I get
to meet the bride?

199
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,775
Let's get you cleaned up first.

200
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,089
So, what's happening
in the land of olly?

201
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,687
You were on your way
to a Pulitzer prize

202
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,660
And a Malibu beach house
and a coke habit.

203
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,062
Wow. You've got
a golf simulator?

204
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,898
Sarah hates it,
cluttering up her flat.

205
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,669
I wouldn't mind
some of that clutter.

206
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,728
Wow.
So this is her flat?

207
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,596
Yeah. Daddy's loaded.

208
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:32,965
So you're gettin' married.

209
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:35,043
That's so grown up.

210
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:39,011
It just felt like
the right time, you know?

211
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:39,952
She's amazing.

212
00:09:39,953 --> 00:09:41,677
Well, she'd have to be.

213
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:42,748
[chuckling]

214
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,179
Where's the zip?

215
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:51,715
I'm presuming these, uh,
aren't yours?

216
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:54,055
Look, olly, I know
I haven't been the...

217
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:56,361
The greatest friend to you
over the last few years.

218
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:59,799
To at least one
of your e-mails.

219
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,969
But I want to make it up to you.

220
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,900
Would you consider being
my best man?

221
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,765
You're kiddin', right?

222
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,814
You'd write
a bloody funny speech.

223
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,284
I would?

224
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:18,723
You know, the funny thing
about James...

225
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,789
[smattering of applause]

226
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,160
Olly?

227
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,001
Huh?

228
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:36,802
I mean, you know,
if you decide you can't.

229
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,796
Ah. You remember Chris.

230
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,206
Yeah, he was
in the powers with you.

231
00:10:41,208 --> 00:10:43,268
Yeah, same measurement,
two years.

232
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:46,276
Chris! Remember olly?

233
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:49,048
You're one
of the successful ones.

234
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,416
Well...

235
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,747
Good to see you.

236
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:53,752
Oh, I, uh, read your book.

237
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:54,754
Fantastic.

238
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:58,685
Thanks. Which
bit did you like?

239
00:10:58,692 --> 00:11:01,727
The, uh...
The beginning was good,

240
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:04,797
Oh, the bit with the...
well, all of it.

241
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:07,667
Have you ever seen
a 30 millimeter shell

242
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,228
Hit a rabbit?

243
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,443
Sorry sight, I can tell you.

244
00:11:11,444 --> 00:11:13,268
See, it's the ears...
boom.

245
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:16,909
Olly, I couldn't steal
Chris for a moment?

246
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,210
Oh, go on.

247
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:21,111
Well, see you later,
olly-gator.

248
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:25,317
I made 500k in
bonuses alone last year.

249
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:26,918
Shipped the whole lot offshore.

250
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,020
Nice little haven in Belize.

251
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,792
So, uh, what do you do?

252
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:34,393
I'm a tax inspector.

253
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:35,894
[cough]

254
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:38,856
Mm, Susan, darling.

255
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:52,335
She's a beauty.

256
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,479
No, I mean
the golfing simulator,

257
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:57,252
Not your wife.

258
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,952
Although
you're very beautiful, too.

259
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:01,223
Come on then, tiger.

260
00:12:01,224 --> 00:12:02,851
Let's see your drive.

261
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:04,786
Jesus!

262
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,731
Fore!

263
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:13,833
Need to watch
that follow-through.

264
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:14,934
[laughing]

265
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:17,835
It's all right.
It's mine.

266
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,738
This is
Mr. And Mrs. Barker,

267
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:21,771
Soon to be
my in-laws.

268
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:24,275
This is olly,
potential best man.

269
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,107
Well, it's clear you're
not a golfer,

270
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:27,113
So what do you do?

271
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:28,084
Olly's a writer.

272
00:12:28,085 --> 00:12:30,981
Would I know any of your work?

273
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,852
Well, uh, ask Chris.

274
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:35,187
He's read one of my books.

275
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:37,988
I'm just gonna...
Excuse me.

276
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,032
Who are you looking for?

277
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:50,102
Ah, I just thought I saw
someone I recognized.

278
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,043
No, you didn't.

279
00:12:51,044 --> 00:12:53,806
Because you had
no one to talk to...

280
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:55,837
Like now.

281
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:02,845
Are you in the habit
of buying women's trousers?

282
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:05,379
What would make you say
a thing like that?

283
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:07,815
Because I have the same pair.

284
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:10,859
Sadly, I only borrowed
these from James because...

285
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,517
They're my bloody trousers,

286
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:13,886
And you've ripped them!

287
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:16,394
No, he got them from upstairs.

288
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:17,896
I live here with Sarah.

289
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:19,198
Who the hell are you?

290
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:20,299
Olly.

291
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,330
[laughing]

292
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:25,435
Olly, the best man?

293
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,010
James said you were funny,

294
00:13:28,011 --> 00:13:29,908
But I thought he meant
funny, ha ha.

295
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,076
Where is he?

296
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,377
He's, uh...

297
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:33,409
Pleasure to meet you.

298
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,548
Hopefully meet again soon.

299
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:37,016
You will.

300
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:38,247
I will?

301
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:42,921
And don't you dare
leave with my trousers.

302
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:46,222
[cell phone rings]

303
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,556
[ring]

304
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:50,829
Who's this?

305
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:52,831
I'm just the guy
you used to live with.

306
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,333
Murray, am I glad
to hear your voice.

307
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,434
Oh, sure. I can tell
you're having a laugh

308
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,036
With your new, old best mate

309
00:13:58,038 --> 00:13:59,468
While I'm stuck at work.

310
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:00,610
Olly: Trust me.
I'm not.

311
00:14:00,611 --> 00:14:02,907
And you're not at work.
You're in the pub.

312
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:04,409
Has he thrown anyone out yet?

313
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:05,541
No, but strangely enough,

314
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:07,905
No one has thrown up on him yet.

315
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:09,348
Look, the truth is

316
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,849
I fell down the stairs,

317
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,421
I nearly decapitated
the father of the bride,

318
00:14:12,422 --> 00:14:14,019
And, as for the bridesmaid,

319
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,420
Let's just say she could
give Sylvia Plath

320
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,022
A run for her money
at the crazy games.

321
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,223
Well, I can't say
I didn't warn you.

322
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:21,956
I can't wait to meet the bride.

323
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,301
I gotta go.

324
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,541
Please tell me you're
not marrying James.

325
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:34,939
Would it be such
a bad thing if I was?

326
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:37,009
It's not always a great idea

327
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,979
To slog off the bride's
entire family

328
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,080
Mmm... I think you left
her mother out.

329
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,383
I was just comin' to her.

330
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,018
Nice to meet you,

331
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,919
And, no, I'm not marrying James.

332
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:52,192
I'm olly, provisional best man.

333
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,456
Would you like to go for a walk?

334
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:57,662
Where to?

335
00:14:57,664 --> 00:15:00,299
I hear the other
corner's beautiful

336
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,630
This time of year.

337
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,495
Okay.

338
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,303
Yeah?

339
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,111
So are you the best man or not?

340
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:16,982
Why? Is there something
wrong with the groom?

341
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,217
James? No.

342
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,978
No, not at all.

343
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:22,186
So, what then?

344
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:26,055
Being best man is
a huge responsibility.

345
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:29,589
He's the groom's
product guarantee.

346
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,659
I don't know if I could
write a funny speech.

347
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:36,626
Oh, it doesn't necessarily
have to be funny.

348
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:38,996
What else am I gonna do, gritty?

349
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:41,105
[laughing]

350
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:44,076
Well, I hope you are best man.

351
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:47,107
'Cause I'd like
to get to know you.

352
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,317
Here we are.

353
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:52,318
You're right.

354
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,187
It's beautiful.

355
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:58,518
Thanks. I grouted
most of it myself.

356
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,566
What an amazing view.

357
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,567
Yeah.

358
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,546
I should go.

359
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:21,677
Yeah.

360
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,081
It was really great.

361
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,753
Likewise.

362
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,026
I can't wait to see you.

363
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:35,157
Ha ha.

364
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,591
So, you having a nice time?

365
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:40,056
Your best man
is having the best time.

366
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:42,496
Can't believe I even needed
time to think about it.

367
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,002
Oh, that's great.

368
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:46,638
James, I met someone.

369
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,669
Christ, you move fast.

370
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,174
What's her name?

371
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,435
I don't know, but rest assured,

372
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:52,614
She's not the bride.

373
00:16:52,615 --> 00:16:54,079
That's a relief.

374
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,150
Do you believe
in love at first sight?

375
00:16:56,151 --> 00:16:58,179
After enough champagne.

376
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,391
Where is she?

377
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,192
There.

378
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,725
Oh, god. Becka?

379
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,257
I didn't get her name.

380
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,196
The one in the black,

381
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,357
Standing next to Sarah,

382
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,295
My fiancée, in white?

383
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,136
Yeah, that's right, yeah.

384
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:19,137
Really?

385
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:20,269
Well, she must have been

386
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,511
Uncharacteristically
nice with you.

387
00:17:22,512 --> 00:17:24,509
She gave me a real bollocking.

388
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:26,811
Well, on second thought,
maybe it's...

389
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:28,213
No, I'm just being cruel.

390
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,114
She's perfect for you.

391
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:30,675
No, I don't know.

392
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:31,723
You just met her.

393
00:17:31,724 --> 00:17:36,248
No, no, no,
don't you dare. No, no.

394
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:39,386
Relax. I'm just going
to introduce you to Sarah.

395
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:43,128
Okay, but don't say anything
about what I said before...

396
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:46,259
To becka.
Not even to Sarah.

397
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:48,066
Okay.

398
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,209
Hey.

399
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,110
Olly, this is
my wife-to-be, Sarah.

400
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:00,853
Great to meet you.

401
00:18:00,854 --> 00:18:02,207
Oh, we've met, actually.

402
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:03,305
Yeah, that's right.

403
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,546
On the balcony.

404
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,489
I believe you know becka.

405
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:14,090
Hey, friendless,
thieving transvestite.

406
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,260
Becka!

407
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,229
[James laughing]

408
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,700
She likes you.

409
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,528
Cheers.

410
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,634
We should all
have a drink very soon.

411
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,566
I'd love that.
All right.

412
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,806
And I'll see what
I can do with becka.

413
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,267
You know, I talked
to her a little more,

414
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:32,175
And I think that old
love at first sight thing

415
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:33,338
Is just a cliché.

416
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:36,146
Good man.

417
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,226
Hey! Olly!

418
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,534
Olly!

419
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:57,796
Hey, Stan.

420
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,204
I've got the latest issue

421
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:03,266
Of Stripped N Whippd for Murray.

422
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,214
Thanks, man.
Thanks.

423
00:19:06,215 --> 00:19:07,882
You don't have a bag, do you?

424
00:19:07,883 --> 00:19:10,851
Yeah, I've got one.

425
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,720
Here you go.

426
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:17,456
Thanks. See you later.

427
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,417
See you around, mate.

428
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,280
Do you know what time it is?

429
00:19:39,281 --> 00:19:42,447
Uh, it's like 10:30
or something.

430
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,478
I know what time it is.

431
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:45,884
Oh.

432
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:52,185
Murray, you're behaving
like a jealous lover.

433
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,486
If I'd suddenly found a...

434
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:57,195
A new, old best friend?

435
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,197
Gutted, if I was 10.

436
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,969
Hello, kitty.

437
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,270
What ever happened
to the old tradition of, uh...

438
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:06,841
You know, hiding them
under the bed?

439
00:20:06,842 --> 00:20:10,676
I'm a proud subscriber
to stripped n whipped.

440
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:13,307
Why are you so perky?

441
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:15,313
You had a good time.

442
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,316
You met someone.

443
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:18,247
No.

444
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:21,220
No, I've got... I've got
a gift for these things.

445
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,287
Call it now...

446
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:23,388
Call it intuition.

447
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,656
Call it bloody annoying.

448
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:25,787
All right, call it
what you like,

449
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:27,692
But you've fallen
big-time.

450
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:28,727
Who is she?

451
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,328
The bride.

452
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,498
Ho ho ho, baby.

453
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:35,329
This just gets
better and better.

454
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:37,435
Now, look, I have to
forget the whole thing,

455
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:38,337
Haven't I?

456
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:41,338
No, look, look,
James doesn't deserve her.

457
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,341
He's a twat.

458
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:43,912
Look, the point is,
I... I...

459
00:20:43,913 --> 00:20:46,310
Why would I hurt my best fr...

460
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:49,451
No, I think a bit of pain
is just what James needs

461
00:20:49,452 --> 00:20:50,679
To grow spiritually.

462
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:51,717
I should know.

463
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:52,878
You're twisted.

464
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:55,345
Hmm, maybe.

465
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,918
Look, I feel I have to stay away

466
00:20:58,925 --> 00:20:59,815
From the bride altogether.

467
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:01,386
It's the right thing to do.

468
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:03,734
He doesn't know
what he wants. I mean...

469
00:21:03,735 --> 00:21:07,000
But I'm...
hand, Murray.

470
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,503
Your one hour
of self-expression

471
00:21:09,504 --> 00:21:12,440
Has left us in no doubt
as to your feelings.

472
00:21:12,441 --> 00:21:14,438
I think you've both been
pretty persuasive,

473
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,310
But if Tania had been
getting married to someone else,

474
00:21:16,311 --> 00:21:17,409
And I didn't break it up,

475
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,410
Then we wouldn't be
together today.

476
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:21,480
See?

477
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:23,811
I wouldn't have broken up
a perfectly happy couple

478
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:25,846
Just because
I fancied one of them.

479
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:27,386
Touché.

480
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:29,887
Graham: I tend to agree
with harry,

481
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:33,589
You can't break up
a perfectly happy couple

482
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:34,763
Just 'cause you
fancy one of them.

483
00:21:34,764 --> 00:21:36,431
That's what harry just said.

484
00:21:36,432 --> 00:21:37,896
Did he?

485
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:39,897
This keeps on happening
to me in court.

486
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:43,499
I think I'm going
to get disbarred.

487
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:46,672
I was once in love
with this girl.

488
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:47,839
Susan.

489
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,409
If I had done
something about it,

490
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:54,010
This sad, desperate barrister

491
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:56,348
With a bunch of loser friends...

492
00:21:56,349 --> 00:22:01,619
But I think I agree
with Murray on this one.

493
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:03,088
Well, that's one all.

494
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:04,919
So Tania's got
the deciding vote.

495
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:07,359
Well, I'm sure you all
know what I think.

496
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,360
Oh, she's a woman.

497
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:09,461
She doesn't know
what she thinks.

498
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:12,362
You can't go splitting up
a perfectly happy couple

499
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:15,625
It's just,
"la la la la la!"

500

501

But sometimes...

502
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,010
Well, sometimes
it's better to do

503
00:22:22,011 --> 00:22:26,408
Rather than what
you think is right.

504
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:28,482
I vote with Murray.

505
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,950
She knows.

506
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:33,722
She knows.

Yeah.

508
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:37,622

I have to avoid her.

510
00:22:38,564 --> 00:22:40,058
Olly, you need a relationship.

511
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:41,489
Yeah, like you'd know.

a cupboard for two days

513
00:22:43,865 --> 00:22:46,431
Mmm, and it was fantastic.

514
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:47,632
Woman: Murray.

515
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:51,870
Look, olly,
maybe James has changed, okay?

516
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,901
But if I can tell that
he's still sleeping around,

517
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,506
Neither hell nor high water's

518
00:22:55,508 --> 00:22:58,677
Murray, you're goin'
all fundamentalist on me.

519
00:22:58,678 --> 00:23:00,138
This isn't gonna be
like that episode

520
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:01,076
With Kylie, is it?

Woman: Murray, baby,
how you doing?

525
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:10,856
Murray: Hi, honey.

526
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:12,987
Anyway, how are you gonna know

527
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:14,692
That James hasn't changed?

528
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:16,461
'Cause I see things.

529
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:17,602
Yeah, well, you used to claim

530
00:23:17,603 --> 00:23:19,857
You could see dead people.

531
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:21,826

the cat.

545
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:53,131
Oh.
Mm.

546
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:54,932
Oh, no, it's okay, mate.
I've got it.

547
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,603
Yeah, you go
and have a good time.

548

Hi, James!

550
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:00,905
Mm, Murray.

551

I'll see you.

552

that means you're free.

Good man.

555

I know this great pub.

556
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:14,147
We used to give our cat
a pill for worms.

557
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:16,793
It's a chronic case.

558
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:19,062
So how did you guys meet?

559
00:24:19,063 --> 00:24:23,458
Did you read about that
subway crash last summer?

560
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:27,132
But it was bloody scary.

561
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,603
And I was there
in new york just for a week,

562
00:24:29,604 --> 00:24:31,602
And I was on that same subway,

563
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:33,674
And I got flattened
by a 300-pound man,

564
00:24:33,675 --> 00:24:36,043
Who decided my lap
was a good crush zone.

565
00:24:36,044 --> 00:24:37,842
That's right. I went
to the hospital,

566
00:24:37,844 --> 00:24:39,814
And who was
in the next door room?

567
00:24:39,815 --> 00:24:41,146
No.

568
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,177
We were there for a week,

569
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:43,750
And we talked about everything.

570
00:24:43,751 --> 00:24:44,919
You know, films that I love.

571
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,617

That I'd missed.

572

573
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:49,993
Great sporting moments,
which I hadn't seen.

574
00:24:49,994 --> 00:24:51,689
Yeah, yep.

575
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:55,760
Wait for me at the bar.

576

Just want to check that
everything's satisfactory.

580
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:02,867
Yes, it's great.

581
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:04,869
Sarah: So kind, and
he really looked after me.

582
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:06,671
James: And on the day
you were getting out...

583
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:07,839
He proposed,

584
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,140
And I foolishly said yes.

585
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:11,242
It's crazy.

To a customer of yours.

596
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:26,921
Um, he's called James.

597
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:28,956
He's the tall prat in the suit

598

599
00:25:30,032 --> 00:25:32,729

Are you James?

603
00:25:46,646 --> 00:25:47,746
Yes.

604

Thanks. Hello?

607
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:03,555
Sorry I lied about who I was
at the engagement party.

608
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:05,901
I just wanted to know
what you thought of James,

609
00:26:05,902 --> 00:26:07,998
You know, before
you knew who I was.

610
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,630
Oh, you wanted
the opinion of a man

611

your entire family.

612
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:14,606
You're right.

614
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,777
Well, he's great.

615
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:21,708
Yeah, I guess we were
just destined to meet.

616
00:26:21,714 --> 00:26:24,983

See you around maybe.

622
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:44,368
So were you
in new york for work?

623
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,140
Uh-huh. I work for a company
that tests films.

What an audience
feels about a film.

627

have their endings changed.

James, you've
never even seen one, okay?

629

in films at all.

00:40:17,182 --> 00:40:20,482
It's just that romantically
it's not gonna happen.

907
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:22,185
There was no lightning bolt.

908
00:40:22,187 --> 00:40:26,887
But it was the kind
you find in horror movies.

909
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:30,588
Well, it doesn't
always happen like that.

910
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:33,555
You don't think so?

911
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,001
When you grow up,
falling in love

912
00:40:35,002 --> 00:40:36,969
Becomes more
about finding someone

913
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,968
Whose strengths
match your weaknesses,

914
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,639
Who you can spend
Sunday evenings with,

915
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,470
Who you don't mind
lying next to every night,

916
00:40:44,476 --> 00:40:46,606
If only because it's
infinitely more bearable

917
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,211
Than being on your own.

918
00:40:48,213 --> 00:40:50,513
No, it doesn't.

919
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:51,745
What do you know?

920
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,980
I've been in love.

921
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:54,875
You have?

922
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:57,716
What was it like?

923
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,495
Some people say that

924
00:41:06,498 --> 00:41:09,767
The ground falls away
beneath you.

925
00:41:09,768 --> 00:41:11,568
But, with me, it was as if

926
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:14,839
I suddenly knew
the ground was there.

927
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,610
As though I could feel
the entire planet

928
00:41:16,611 --> 00:41:20,908
Right there beneath
the soles of my feet.

929
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:25,683
Although, I felt the same way

930
00:41:25,684 --> 00:41:28,124
When I went up
the empire state building.

931
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:29,687
What happened?

932
00:41:29,688 --> 00:41:30,648
I threw up.

933
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,785
Can't stand heights.

934
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:34,258
No.

935
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:37,029
I mean with the girl.

936
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,670
Woman:
Sarah barker.

937
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:48,707
[doorbell rings]

938
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,580
Yes?

939
00:41:56,581 --> 00:41:58,816
I'm from Michael Mirken
estate agents.

940
00:41:58,817 --> 00:42:00,177
James asked me
to value the flat.

941
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:03,015
I don't think so.

942
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,519
Have you got
any I.D.?

943
00:42:07,526 --> 00:42:08,686
Very clever.

944
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,663
You know, and it's despicable

945
00:42:10,664 --> 00:42:13,162
What people
get up to these days.

946
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:14,704
What are you talking about?

947
00:42:14,705 --> 00:42:17,167
Gosh, I could be a thief

948
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:18,568
Or a mugger

949
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:21,240
Or a sexual deviant.

950
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,705
Looking at you,
I very much doubt that,

951
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:28,750
But there's always hope.

952
00:42:28,751 --> 00:42:30,577
So James is selling
the flat, is he?

953
00:42:30,582 --> 00:42:31,682
Nice of him to tell me.

954
00:42:31,683 --> 00:42:34,053
Well, I just spoke
to him on his mobile.

955
00:42:34,054 --> 00:42:35,652
Do you want to give him a bell?

956
00:42:35,654 --> 00:42:38,294
Have you thought
about your list at all?

957
00:42:38,295 --> 00:42:40,720
Yes, I do have a few ideas.

958
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,725
Well, if you'd just
like to come this way,

959
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:45,297
We'll give you a few...

960
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:53,065
I do.

961
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,275
Olly.

962
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:01,077
Dana?

963
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:04,048
Woman: What color do you want
the bridesmaids in?

964
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:05,679
Uh, there are no bridesmaids.

965
00:43:05,684 --> 00:43:07,854
There's no groom,
there's no wedding.

966
00:43:07,855 --> 00:43:10,788
This isn't even
the bridal department.

967
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:12,156
What's happened?

968
00:43:12,157 --> 00:43:13,757
Is it off?

969
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,726
She's already married.

970
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:17,087
That is enough, olly!

971
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:18,855
I am in a meeting!

972
00:43:18,863 --> 00:43:20,030
A meeting?

973
00:43:20,031 --> 00:43:20,931
Yes.

974
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:26,042
Is beginning to look
pretty stupid here.

975
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:30,240
Well...

976
00:43:30,241 --> 00:43:32,910
See you back at the office.

977
00:43:32,911 --> 00:43:34,741
What?!

978
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:37,676
So this is the second
stunning bedroom,

979
00:43:37,682 --> 00:43:40,382
Boasting contemporary living.

980
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:42,951
Happy, are they,
James and Sarah?

981
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:45,694
What's that got to do
with the value of the property?

982
00:43:45,695 --> 00:43:49,790
En suite bathroom,
his and her toilets.

983
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:51,894
That's a bidet.

984
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:53,202
Oh.

985
00:43:53,203 --> 00:43:55,868
So a french toilet.

986
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:58,696
Oh, and wall-mounted
manacles.

987
00:43:58,703 --> 00:44:01,872
So, not happy then?

988
00:44:01,873 --> 00:44:02,873
If you want my opinion,

989
00:44:02,874 --> 00:44:04,944
Actually, no, they're not.

990
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:08,846
And those are towel rails.

991
00:44:08,847 --> 00:44:09,877
Hmm.

992
00:44:09,881 --> 00:44:11,781
Fantastic...

993
00:44:11,783 --> 00:44:13,253
Flat.

994
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,258
Third bedroom?

995
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:23,059
Walk-in cupboard.

996
00:44:23,061 --> 00:44:24,261
Cupboard?

997
00:44:24,262 --> 00:44:25,032
Hmm.

998
00:44:25,033 --> 00:44:27,197
Are you an Aries?

999
00:44:27,198 --> 00:44:28,298
Are you an estate agent,

1000
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:30,267
Or a cheap astrologer?

1001
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:32,338
You know, leave
no stone unturned.

1002
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:34,797
I mean, knowledge is power.

1003
00:44:34,806 --> 00:44:37,906
That's Bert and Ernie...
sesame street.

1004
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:41,812
Oh, my feet.

1005
00:44:41,813 --> 00:44:43,453
Oh.

1006
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:48,689
Oh, will you just drop
the bags right there?

1007
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:51,817
Thank you.
You're an angel, olly.

1008
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:54,391
Oh, I see you brought
the charming best man

1009
00:44:54,392 --> 00:44:57,092
Spot of shopping
with the top girl?

1010
00:44:57,095 --> 00:44:59,825
I didn't know you
were selling the flat.

1011
00:44:59,831 --> 00:45:00,898
Selling the flat?

1012
00:45:00,899 --> 00:45:01,899
The estate agent.

1013
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,870
The realtor, he's still here.

1014
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,098
I'm so confused.

1015
00:45:05,103 --> 00:45:08,839
James has organized
evaluation for this flat.

1016
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:12,440
Becka, are you sure
he's an estate agent?

1017
00:45:12,444 --> 00:45:14,478
Yeah, I think so.

1018
00:45:14,479 --> 00:45:16,779
I left him through there.

1019
00:45:16,781 --> 00:45:18,849
Would you go do something?

1020
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,850
Yeah, I'll go.

1021
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,790
Tony?

1022
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:24,918
Yeah, right, Jim.

1023
00:45:24,923 --> 00:45:27,163
You wait here.

1024
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:40,266
Sarah:
This is so creepy.

1025
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:43,207
Becka: Actually,
he seemed quite nice.

1026
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:44,108
Olly: Nice?

1027
00:45:44,109 --> 00:45:45,509
Sarah:
What did he want?

1028
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:47,510
I don't know. He kept
asking all these questions

1029
00:45:47,512 --> 00:45:50,380
About the flat,
about who I lived with.

1030
00:45:50,381 --> 00:45:54,251
In the time he was here
than my last boyfriend did

1031
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:56,386
During an entire
two-year ordeal.

1032
00:45:56,387 --> 00:45:57,387
Sarah: Really?

1033
00:45:57,388 --> 00:45:58,758
What did he look like?

1034
00:45:58,759 --> 00:46:01,757
He had this cheeky, young face,

1035
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,860
And he ate all our biscuits.

1036
00:46:02,861 --> 00:46:03,961
All right, I'm going inside.

1037
00:46:03,962 --> 00:46:05,192
I'm gonna call James.

1038
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:06,896
Okay.

1039
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:09,931
Yeah, let's go.

1040
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,034
Oh, no.

1041
00:46:11,035 --> 00:46:12,535
Aah!

1042
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:14,871
It's okay.

1043
00:46:14,873 --> 00:46:16,940
Um, I'm off the telly,

1044
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:19,281
So, yeah.

1045
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:24,148
Would you type this up
for me, please?

1046
00:46:24,149 --> 00:46:25,879
Yeah, sure.

1047
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,857
This letter is firing me.

1048
00:46:38,863 --> 00:46:40,130
Yes, and when you finish,

1049
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:41,431
Bring it through for me to sign.

1050
00:46:41,432 --> 00:46:45,902
I'm not gonna type up
my own dismissal letter.

1051
00:46:45,904 --> 00:46:49,814
I can't do it myself.
How would that look?

1052
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:53,007
Is this because I caught you
trying on a dress

1053
00:46:53,011 --> 00:46:54,441
For a fictitious wedding?

1054
00:46:54,445 --> 00:46:56,575
Are you even married?

1055
00:46:56,581 --> 00:46:59,081
Do you even have a husband?

1056
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:03,820
You have recently made
an unofficial excursion,

1057
00:47:03,822 --> 00:47:05,022
Which is specifically against

1058
00:47:05,023 --> 00:47:06,193
The terms of your contr...

1059
00:47:06,194 --> 00:47:08,959
This is from a catalog.

1060
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,060
You've been lying
about being married

1061
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:12,830
For 3 years?

1062
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:15,866
All those pointless late nights?

1063
00:47:15,867 --> 00:47:17,197
I knew you'd take this
personally.

1064
00:47:17,202 --> 00:47:18,869
Making me feel guilty?

1065
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:22,100
You didn't even have
a husband to go home to.

1066
00:47:22,106 --> 00:47:25,066
You're fired!
Fired, fired, fired!

1067
00:47:25,076 --> 00:47:27,976
Endlessly photocopying
management documents,

1068
00:47:27,979 --> 00:47:30,879
Detailing the work ethic
of the department!

1069
00:47:30,882 --> 00:47:32,482
That's me and you!

1070
00:47:32,483 --> 00:47:34,918
You know what really gets to me?

1071
00:47:34,919 --> 00:47:38,119
You even spelled my name wrong.

1072
00:47:38,122 --> 00:47:40,492
[snaps pencil]

1073
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:44,493
I'm so sorry.

1074
00:47:44,495 --> 00:47:46,025
Who are you?

1075
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,130
Security.
Let me help you.

1076
00:47:47,131 --> 00:47:48,931
Please don't hit me again!

1077
00:47:48,933 --> 00:47:49,973
I didn't hit you.

1078
00:47:49,974 --> 00:47:52,398
Look, it was an accident.

1079
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:55,143
I'm sure... ohh!

1080
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:58,642
You know, I realized
something about James today.

1081
00:47:58,643 --> 00:48:02,246
He's entirely friendless,
apart from you,

1082
00:48:02,247 --> 00:48:06,077
Ah, he's got Chris,
who's organizing the stag party.

1083
00:48:06,084 --> 00:48:07,324
They were
in the powers together.

1084
00:48:07,325 --> 00:48:09,048
Uh-huh, and apart
from power Chris?

1085
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:11,123
Probably got a bunch in America,

1086

01:04:02,272 --> 01:04:04,440
Well, he washes out of top gun,

1447
01:04:04,441 --> 01:04:06,008
And the iceman wins.

1448
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:06,979
What about the girl?

1449
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:08,837
Well, he goes back to the ship,

1450
01:04:08,846 --> 01:04:10,876
And he has
this really cool dogfight

1451
01:04:10,881 --> 01:04:12,911
Where he kills
a couple of ruskies.

1452
01:04:12,916 --> 01:04:14,976
What's this got to do
with Sarah?

1453
01:04:14,985 --> 01:04:16,945
He leaves the girl.

1454
01:04:16,954 --> 01:04:21,524
Yeah, but he loves the girl,
but he leaves her.

1455
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:23,091
What?

1456
01:04:23,093 --> 01:04:25,061
You're cracking up.

1457
01:04:25,062 --> 01:04:28,931
Sarah's not sure
that you love her.

1458
01:04:28,932 --> 01:04:29,602
Oh.

1459
01:04:29,603 --> 01:04:33,436
Okay, but she doesn't believe it.

1460
01:04:33,437 --> 01:04:37,206
Because you're
not seeing her for her,

1461
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:38,407
As an individual.

1462
01:04:38,408 --> 01:04:39,508
Oh, god.

1463
01:04:39,509 --> 01:04:41,239
How do I do that?

1464
01:04:41,245 --> 01:04:42,435
You leave,

1465
01:04:42,446 --> 01:04:44,006
Not because you don't love her,

1466
01:04:44,014 --> 01:04:46,616
You do more
than any man ever did.

1467
01:04:46,617 --> 01:04:49,647
Because you can't live
with even the possibility

1468
01:04:49,653 --> 01:04:52,053
That she doesn't feel the same.

1469
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:55,385
Before you go,
you write her a letter.

1470
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:59,392
Everything she wants
to hear and more.

1471
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:00,926
I deliver it.

1472
01:05:00,931 --> 01:05:03,601
Just in time for her
to race to the airport

1473
01:05:03,602 --> 01:05:06,168
And stop you
getting on the plane.

1474
01:05:06,169 --> 01:05:07,899
Do you think it'll work?

1475
01:05:07,905 --> 01:05:10,065
Well, you only know
how much you love someone

1476
01:05:10,073 --> 01:05:12,213
When you lose them.

1477
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:15,209
You're a genius.

1478
01:05:16,012 --> 01:05:17,079
Now go write it.

1479
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,980
Mmm, yes.

1480
01:05:18,982 --> 01:05:20,449
Yes.

1481
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:21,918
James: "dear..."

1482
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:23,019
Olly: "Sarah."

1483
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,050
"dear Sarah..."

1484
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:33,058
How would you
normally start a letter?

1485
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:36,670
"Following up previous
conversation on the 16th..."

1486
01:05:36,671 --> 01:05:39,297
No, you're not extending
her overdraft.

1487
01:05:39,303 --> 01:05:41,971
"Uh, dear Sarah...

1488
01:05:41,972 --> 01:05:44,372
"now that I know
you don't love me,

1489
01:05:44,374 --> 01:05:46,642
"I have decided to leave town.

1490
01:05:46,643 --> 01:05:49,111
"I only want you to be happy.

1491
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:51,712
"Before I go,
I just want to say..."

1492
01:05:51,715 --> 01:05:53,675
At which point, you tell her
how much you love her.

1493
01:05:53,684 --> 01:05:56,719
Are you sure you don't
want to write this?

1494
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,120
Look, I have a confession.

1495
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:01,357
I'm not really a writer.

1496
01:06:01,358 --> 01:06:03,526
Look, I'm
just a P.A., okay?

1497
01:06:03,527 --> 01:06:05,457
You're not a writer?

1498
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:06,996
No.

1499
01:06:06,997 --> 01:06:09,097
So you deceived me.

1500
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:12,066
Well, what about
my best man speech?

1501
01:06:12,069 --> 01:06:15,569
It's hardly relevant
at the moment,

1502
01:06:15,572 --> 01:06:16,502
But, uh...

1503
01:06:16,506 --> 01:06:19,666
For the record, it's not good.

1504
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:23,143
So what do we do?

1505
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:24,106
Look at me.

1506
01:06:24,114 --> 01:06:26,014
Look at me.
Relax your jaw.

1507
01:06:26,016 --> 01:06:29,176
Now, what first
attracted you to Sarah?

1508
01:06:29,186 --> 01:06:29,746
Be honest.

1509
01:06:29,753 --> 01:06:31,120
Her father's money.

1510
01:06:31,121 --> 01:06:34,221
That's a joke, right?

1511
01:06:35,091 --> 01:06:36,559
Yeah.

1512
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,760
Honestly...

1513
01:06:39,195 --> 01:06:41,325
I found her to be beautiful.

1514
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:43,666
She's a beautiful person, yes.

1515
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:46,097
Maybe a little more soulful.

1516
01:06:46,103 --> 01:06:47,169
I like...

1517
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:49,238
The smell of her hair.

1518
01:06:49,239 --> 01:06:50,569
Even more soulful.

1519
01:06:50,574 --> 01:06:53,109
I love the smell of her hair.

1520
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:54,240
No, you say you like
the smell of her hair,

1521
01:06:54,244 --> 01:06:55,614
What you're really saying is

1522
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:59,148
Coupled with the fact
that she uses it regularly.

1523
01:06:59,149 --> 01:07:03,249
Come on! There's tons
of things to like about Sarah.

1524
01:07:03,253 --> 01:07:06,253
I'm not the one who's supposed
to be in love with her.

1525
01:07:06,256 --> 01:07:07,116
You are.

1526
01:07:07,124 --> 01:07:09,194
Pretend you are.

1527
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:12,226
Yeah.

1528
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:18,225
What about when she
takes off her shoes

1529
01:07:18,235 --> 01:07:19,095
And wiggles her toes?

1530
01:07:19,102 --> 01:07:22,238
I've never noticed, but...

1531
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:24,069
That's good.

1532
01:07:24,074 --> 01:07:26,308
What about when she's up running

1533
01:07:26,309 --> 01:07:29,239
And she looks like
she owns the whole world?

1534
01:07:29,246 --> 01:07:30,646
I've never been to one.

1535
01:07:30,647 --> 01:07:33,516
Or the way her hips move
when she dances?

1536
01:07:33,517 --> 01:07:35,417
Oh, yeah, I love that.

1537
01:07:35,419 --> 01:07:37,149
Or her warm hands?

1538
01:07:37,154 --> 01:07:39,092
Although sometimes they
can get a bit sweaty.

1539
01:07:39,093 --> 01:07:41,289
Okay, but don't write
that last bit.

1540
01:07:41,291 --> 01:07:43,221
What about the way when she...

1541
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:44,786
Slow down, slow down.

1542
01:07:44,795 --> 01:07:47,655
No, no, you do it.

1543
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:50,401
No, I...

1544
01:07:52,268 --> 01:07:53,698
Please.

1545
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:06,816
What about the way she can argue

1546
01:08:06,817 --> 01:08:08,547
About absolutely nothing

1547
01:08:08,552 --> 01:08:11,622
And still win you 'round
to her point of view?

1548
01:08:11,623 --> 01:08:14,421
Look, I'm just gonna
pop out for coffee.

1549
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:15,424

Hi.

What are you doing here?

Oh, I see.

Shall I make some coffee?

Oh, I'm in shock.

I can't believe this
is the same person.

1608
01:11:24,347 --> 01:11:26,807
Well, sometimes writing
brings out the, you know,

1609
01:11:26,816 --> 01:11:28,716
Different side in someone.

1610
01:11:28,718 --> 01:11:30,486

1611
01:11:30,487 --> 01:11:31,917
Yeah, he, uh...

1612
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:34,421
He mentioned
something about, um...

1613
01:11:34,424 --> 01:11:37,393
