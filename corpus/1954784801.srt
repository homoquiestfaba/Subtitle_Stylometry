1
00:00:01,235 --> 00:00:03,001
Actually, I think it's a huge
mistake

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,535
to play Bach to start with.

3
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:05,102
Why?

4
00:00:05,104 --> 00:00:07,337
I'll tell you why.

5
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:08,971
Because, you know, this is a
fifteen minute audition.

6
00:00:08,973 --> 00:00:10,906
You need to make a statement.

7
00:00:10,908 --> 00:00:13,575
You need to impress the jury.

8
00:00:13,577 --> 00:00:14,709
And what would you like me

9
00:00:14,711 --> 00:00:15,710
to make an impression with?

10
00:00:15,712 --> 00:00:17,511
Well I think, in my mind,

11
00:00:17,513 --> 00:00:21,548
you would start with probably a
Rachmaninoff Sonata.

12
00:00:22,584 --> 00:00:26,485
Are you fucking insane?

13
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:10,685
Bravo! Bravo!

14
00:02:30,911 --> 00:02:34,812
Okay I'm ready.

15
00:02:36,315 --> 00:02:40,383
Buskowski, Schumann, Scarlatti.

16
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:47,589
I'm tired.

17
00:03:05,438 --> 00:03:09,305
Sing a fifth first and just
take it down.

18
00:03:09,307 --> 00:03:13,275
Same thing.

19
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,011
Marika is spending Valentine's
Day

20
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:20,380
in New York City.

21
00:03:20,382 --> 00:03:20,913
Yeah...

22
00:03:20,915 --> 00:03:22,581
In a classroom.

23
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,016
Yeah!

24
00:03:25,018 --> 00:03:26,884
That's Carnegie Hall.

25
00:03:26,886 --> 00:03:27,885
You ever played there?

26
00:03:27,887 --> 00:03:31,121
Yeah I played two times there.

27
00:03:31,123 --> 00:03:33,289
Is it nice to walk back by it?

28
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:37,392
Well yeah but I see it every
weekend.

29
00:03:37,394 --> 00:03:39,026
Yeah but the important is to
play...

30
00:03:39,028 --> 00:03:43,196
Play there.

31
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,025
Do you spend a lot of time

32
00:04:22,027 --> 00:04:24,594
waiting when you come?

33
00:04:24,596 --> 00:04:25,728
Yeah well usually what I do

34
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,765
is I'll just take her to her
lesson and then... go.

35
00:04:32,136 --> 00:04:34,636
There's nothing else I can do.

36
00:04:34,638 --> 00:04:38,539
The day flies.

37
00:04:58,355 --> 00:04:59,454
Okay, you know...

38
00:04:59,456 --> 00:05:00,087
I sound really bad.

39
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:02,522
Well what happened is

40
00:05:02,524 --> 00:05:05,091
that your guitar is stuck.

41
00:05:05,093 --> 00:05:07,726
Or you're strumming the air

42
00:05:07,728 --> 00:05:09,928
instead of strumming the
strings.

43
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,064
You're doing this and...

44
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:15,866
yeah this has to sound like

45
00:05:15,868 --> 00:05:18,635
a very energetic strumming of a
guitar.

46
00:05:18,637 --> 00:05:20,336
Marika is a very intense kid.

47
00:05:20,338 --> 00:05:24,406
And intensity is a two-edge
sword.

48
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:31,879
Just relax, and just play.

49
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:32,980
If she plays a wrong note

50
00:05:32,982 --> 00:05:34,815
she gets so angry with herself

51
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:36,416
that that's all you can see...

52
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:40,486
if she could hit herself she
would.

53
00:05:52,764 --> 00:05:54,063
See, now you sound like
something

54
00:05:54,065 --> 00:05:55,831
because you sound like you have
character

55
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:59,734
in the playing instead of fear.

56
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:03,303
How did it go?

57
00:06:03,305 --> 00:06:05,638
It went well I just got my
grade report

58
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,073
from pre-College division.

59
00:06:08,075 --> 00:06:10,642
And it's pretty good.

60
00:06:10,644 --> 00:06:13,411
I have As. That means honors.

61
00:06:13,413 --> 00:06:17,047
So I'm happy yeah!

62
00:06:17,049 --> 00:06:21,150
A nice way to finish the day.

63
00:06:27,991 --> 00:06:30,124
You know we keep looking at the
horses

64
00:06:30,126 --> 00:06:32,092
and always wondering are we
going to go

65
00:06:32,094 --> 00:06:35,161
for a little ride at some point.

66
00:06:35,163 --> 00:06:39,298
But we haven't done it yet.

67
00:08:49,335 --> 00:08:53,403
You don't want to look like a
gothic.

68
00:09:29,866 --> 00:09:33,867
Oh shit.

69
00:09:35,637 --> 00:09:39,672
It's been a few months I
haven't performed.

70
00:09:41,108 --> 00:09:43,975
So it's going to be the first
time

71
00:09:43,977 --> 00:09:48,078
I'm performing a real recital...

72
00:09:49,848 --> 00:09:53,716
I'm getting stressed a little
bit now.

73
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:41,767
Well it went pretty well,

74
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,902
I was just I got really tired

75
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:46,938
because the piano is actually
heavier

76
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,106
than at my house, actually yeah,

77
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,141
so I got a little bit tired

78
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,443
by playing a Scarlatti Sonatas

79
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:57,346
but hopefully Schumann was a
bit quieter so...

80
00:12:05,054 --> 00:12:06,787
Are you going to wait for your
daddy or no?

81
00:12:06,789 --> 00:12:07,687
Yes, I think I will wait for him

82
00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:08,587
because it's not professional

83
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:10,288
going out and seeing my dad

84
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,492
so I'm just going to wait until
my dad comes

85
00:12:14,494 --> 00:12:16,827
because I think he's talking
with his friends

86
00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:19,529
that came so I'm going to let
him talk

87
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,998
and he'll come soon I know.

88
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,168
No doubt.

89
00:12:48,354 --> 00:12:49,553
Yes.

90
00:12:55,427 --> 00:12:58,361
In which piece?

91
00:13:04,068 --> 00:13:06,334
No, but Schumann...

92
00:13:06,336 --> 00:13:07,668
Yes, yes Schumann

93
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,903
but they're not at the same
tempo.

94
00:13:09,905 --> 00:13:11,137
The pieces are not written at
the same tempo...

95
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:15,140
Inside each piece, pieces are
too short,

96
00:13:17,944 --> 00:13:20,878
too short to change each tempo
inside.

97
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,714
You need more unity of that
movement...

98
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,817
Yes he's here, I think he's
talking over there.

99
00:13:36,657 --> 00:13:38,289
Yes.

100
00:13:52,402 --> 00:13:53,000
Ok.

101
00:13:53,002 --> 00:13:54,267
All the best.

102
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:58,237
Thank you.

103
00:17:10,786 --> 00:17:14,720
Air Canada, Montreal passenger,
Marika Bournaki, flight at gate G12.

104
00:18:06,595 --> 00:18:08,361
When I listen to Marika play,

105
00:18:08,363 --> 00:18:12,398
I find that she has this
beautiful tonality,

106
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:17,069
she has something that cannot
be taught.

107
00:18:17,071 --> 00:18:21,139
You learn technique, you learn
pedaling,

108
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:25,142
you learn to read music but you
don't learn heart.

109
00:18:26,912 --> 00:18:29,612
Heart is something, which you
have to feel,

110
00:18:29,614 --> 00:18:33,582
you just sense.

111
00:19:31,225 --> 00:19:35,193
As the time approaches, she'll
feel more nervous

112
00:19:37,564 --> 00:19:41,065
and I know I'm going to hear
the same stuff...

113
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:42,900
I'm afraid, and this and that.

114
00:19:42,902 --> 00:19:47,070
It's usual.

115
00:19:48,473 --> 00:19:50,539
Sometimes I just don't really
want to practice

116
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:53,074
or maybe I'm better off being
in Montreal

117
00:19:53,076 --> 00:19:55,076
and being with my friends

118
00:19:55,078 --> 00:19:56,410
and having fun and go to
parties...

119
00:19:56,412 --> 00:19:59,112
but in the end, I really like
what I do

120
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,447
and I'm sure it can bring me
really far,

121
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:04,383
and makes me happy and people
around me happy.

122
00:20:04,385 --> 00:20:08,319
So, why not do it?

123
00:22:00,575 --> 00:22:02,541
Stupendous, thank you.

124
00:22:02,543 --> 00:22:06,211
Thank you very much.

125
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:10,248
Her fingers from the side
reminded me of a spider

126
00:22:11,951 --> 00:22:14,785
if you will but the feminity of
a real woman

127
00:22:16,321 --> 00:22:19,221
taking control of that
Steinway.

128
00:22:19,223 --> 00:22:23,124
Excellent, excellent,

129
00:22:23,126 --> 00:22:25,593
I have grandchildren and I try
to get them

130
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:29,630
to learn but it has to be...
it's a gift.

131
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:34,734
I liked your pretty hands.

132
00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:38,670
Thank very much, thank you.

133
00:23:07,994 --> 00:23:11,862
The instructions enclosed...

134
00:23:20,237 --> 00:23:21,836
Do her parents know that
she's...

135
00:23:21,838 --> 00:23:23,103
Yeah yeah they know.

136
00:23:23,105 --> 00:23:25,138
Her mom told me to get her out
of class.

137
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,772
So what are we going to do?

138
00:23:26,774 --> 00:23:28,206
Bring her to Second Cup.

139
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:32,209
Second Cup? I mean she's not
stupid guys.

140
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:37,613
When she's coming we talk about
euhm...

141
00:23:37,615 --> 00:23:38,981
Just say we're talking about...

142
00:23:38,983 --> 00:23:40,215
The O.C.! Starting on thursday.

143
00:23:40,217 --> 00:23:42,183
The O.C. ok the O.C.

144
00:23:42,185 --> 00:23:43,951
They are so good liars...

145
00:23:43,953 --> 00:23:45,819
Oh yeah, so it's easy.

146
00:23:45,821 --> 00:23:47,821
Then at least now we've put
them to work

147
00:23:47,823 --> 00:23:48,888
for a good cause.

148
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:52,658
Yeah exactly.

149
00:24:40,697 --> 00:24:41,962
We're all shocked.

150
00:24:41,964 --> 00:24:43,196
Everyone is pretty in shock.

151
00:24:43,198 --> 00:24:44,897
She told us like a week ago.

152
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:48,934
We haven't seen her almost the
entire summer.

153
00:24:48,936 --> 00:24:52,770
And she says she's leaving...
like forever.

154
00:24:55,207 --> 00:24:57,273
Although we don't see Marika
that much

155
00:24:57,275 --> 00:25:00,943
because she's always practicing
and stuff

156
00:25:00,945 --> 00:25:02,778
like for her to leave...

157
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:06,748
it's a shock.

158
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:22,427
I'll come back!

159
00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:26,363
I know you'll be back.

160
00:25:34,571 --> 00:25:38,539
Surprise!

161
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:05,295
Apply pressure on left and
right side

162
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:09,332
with arms and think about how
special you are

163
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:13,269
to so many people.

164
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:13,771
Aw!

165
00:26:23,946 --> 00:26:25,612
Marika, during the course of
these two years

166
00:26:25,614 --> 00:26:28,147
we've seen you grow and become
who you are today

167
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:29,915
it's hard to let someone go so
soon

168
00:26:29,917 --> 00:26:31,249
but we know that this will help
you

169
00:26:31,251 --> 00:26:32,984
and you will be the great
pianist

170
00:26:32,986 --> 00:26:34,785
you deserve to be some day.

171
00:26:34,787 --> 00:26:36,319
We've all experienced so much
of you

172
00:26:36,321 --> 00:26:38,154
and believe that it is all
unforgettable,

173
00:26:38,156 --> 00:26:39,889
be it the good and the bad.

174
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:42,958
Not having you around will be a
big change

175
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,726
and will leave an empty space
in our group

176
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,794
and our lunch table.

177
00:26:46,796 --> 00:26:49,229
We still can't believe that
this is all ending so fast

178
00:26:49,231 --> 00:26:50,863
and in short just know that we
will

179
00:26:50,865 --> 00:26:54,799
no doubt miss you

180
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,073
and also remember to be true to
yourself

181
00:27:04,075 --> 00:27:06,375
and don't be afraid to show
anyone the real Marika.

182
00:27:06,377 --> 00:27:08,577
We love you and care very much
no matter what.

183
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:10,245
Remember that.

184
00:27:10,247 --> 00:27:13,348
Your friends Jessica and
Kirsten.

185
00:27:45,508 --> 00:27:49,409
I hate brushing my teeth.

186
00:28:19,334 --> 00:28:20,099
There's this song,

187
00:28:20,101 --> 00:28:21,667
I don't know if you know it.

188
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:23,969
Jack Johnson Banana Pancakes.

189
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:26,037
And it's like euhm...

190
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,105
well I'll just play it.

191
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:31,842
But basically, it sounds like
go back to sleep.

192
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:33,977
So it's like, my mom was
listening to it,

193
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:36,513
this is what she listens to in
the morning,

194
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:38,248
but this is not good it's just
like

195
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,649
"can't you see that it's just
raining

196
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:43,652
ain't no need to go outside".

197
00:28:53,829 --> 00:28:57,030
It's always hard to live away I
think.

198
00:28:57,032 --> 00:28:58,831
When I first moved here

199
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:02,401
I wasn't used to be on my own

200
00:29:02,403 --> 00:29:03,935
and doing everything on my own

201
00:29:03,937 --> 00:29:07,405
and not having my parents drive
me...

202
00:29:07,407 --> 00:29:09,774
I had to figure out how to
travel.

203
00:29:09,776 --> 00:29:11,041
It was an hour at first.

204
00:29:11,043 --> 00:29:13,176
You know, going to school, the
train,

205
00:29:13,178 --> 00:29:14,844
I had to figure out the train
system.

206
00:29:14,846 --> 00:29:17,913
I had no one to show me.

207
00:29:17,915 --> 00:29:21,749
Ouch. I swear I will fall in
front of you.

208
00:29:23,352 --> 00:29:27,453
See it's very tidy it's very...

209
00:29:30,024 --> 00:29:31,656
I think I know myself better,

210
00:29:31,658 --> 00:29:34,425
because you know I'm by myself.

211
00:29:34,427 --> 00:29:37,428
I get a lot of time with myself

212
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:40,297
to think about my likes and
dislikes

213
00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:43,066
and also I get to do whatever I
want to do

214
00:29:43,068 --> 00:29:45,134
whenever I want to do.

215
00:29:45,136 --> 00:29:47,302
I used to actually care what I
looked like...

216
00:29:47,304 --> 00:29:50,371
oh I know what I'm going to
wear!

217
00:29:50,373 --> 00:29:52,806
My sweatpants!

218
00:29:52,808 --> 00:29:54,808
"Waking up too early,

219
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:58,678
maybe we could sleep in"...
see! Why!

220
00:30:02,516 --> 00:30:06,617
Pretend like it's the weekend
now.

221
00:30:10,755 --> 00:30:14,656
I suck at life.

222
00:30:53,989 --> 00:30:55,989
So have you guys met any guys?

223
00:30:55,991 --> 00:30:57,957
Have you been dating at all?

224
00:30:57,959 --> 00:30:59,758
I think this is the first time

225
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,226
you've asked me this question.

226
00:31:01,228 --> 00:31:03,861
No, this is why would you ask
this question!

227
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:05,829
I don't know! I just hit me,

228
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:06,663
like two girls together, just
like...

229
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:10,599
I don't know!

230
00:31:12,536 --> 00:31:13,868
Were at Juilliard.

231
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:17,604
Okay, one, we were in the same
high school.

232
00:31:17,606 --> 00:31:18,838
We were in PCS.

233
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,774
Everybody is gay.

234
00:31:21,776 --> 00:31:22,775
Yeah...

235
00:31:22,777 --> 00:31:26,678
or discusting. So... sorry PCS!

236
00:31:28,248 --> 00:31:31,182
And then... Juilliard is almost
the same story.

237
00:31:31,184 --> 00:31:35,252
But more of the latter than the
former.

238
00:31:47,863 --> 00:31:50,096
It's like a...

239
00:31:50,098 --> 00:31:51,297
It's all the same level.

240
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:55,801
Yeah. So what do you do about
it.

241
00:31:55,803 --> 00:31:57,369
I change it...

242
00:31:57,371 --> 00:31:58,069
Right.

243
00:31:58,071 --> 00:31:58,969
But you can't change it

244
00:31:58,971 --> 00:32:02,805
when you're sitting there...

245
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:15,349
Everything you do wrong is on
your face immediately.

246
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:17,384
If there's a sound you don't
like,

247
00:32:17,386 --> 00:32:19,686
whether there's a note that you
missed...

248
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:22,655
whether it's fumbling a trill
or something...

249
00:32:22,657 --> 00:32:26,558
it's immediately on your face.

250
00:32:27,827 --> 00:32:31,761
Seriously.

251
00:32:37,134 --> 00:32:39,334
Marika is definitely a colt.

252
00:32:39,336 --> 00:32:43,437
A very vibrant and very
energetic one.

253
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,973
She does need to be tamed
sometimes.

254
00:32:46,975 --> 00:32:49,308
But you know, sometimes you
wonder

255
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,009
how much taming you want to do

256
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:54,812
because you don't want them to
lose that spirit.

257
00:33:16,932 --> 00:33:20,833
Okay, we're going. Oh!
Caramels.

258
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:27,138
Would you like some caramel?
Homemade.

259
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:34,144
Bye Momma.

260
00:34:13,743 --> 00:34:15,609
We are going to Ottawa.

261
00:34:15,611 --> 00:34:17,644
Or Gatineau... where?

262
00:34:17,646 --> 00:34:19,345
Yeah, well I mean Gatineau is

263
00:34:19,347 --> 00:34:23,148
right on the other side of the
Ottawa river.

264
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,782
And why are we going today now?

265
00:34:24,784 --> 00:34:26,250
Well, what do you think?

266
00:34:26,252 --> 00:34:30,253
Oh yeah, to practice on Glenn
Gould's piano!

267
00:34:58,244 --> 00:35:01,044
I'll get full scholarship for
College.

268
00:35:01,046 --> 00:35:03,146
I'll get to the top of the list.

269
00:35:03,148 --> 00:35:05,181
I'll be number one.

270
00:35:05,183 --> 00:35:07,816
And I'll get all the money.

271
00:35:07,818 --> 00:35:11,486
Well, you know what? That would
be nice.

272
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:15,422
I know.

273
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,074
That's not what it sounded
like...

274
00:35:47,815 --> 00:35:51,683
That's what it is...

275
00:35:53,386 --> 00:35:56,453
Oh my god. Look at his
sunglasses.

276
00:35:57,456 --> 00:36:00,156
Unbelievable. You have them
with you?

277
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,727
See! It's like, it could be one
of them.

278
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:06,162
Look at this, it's unbelievable.

279
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,664
It's exactly the same style as
the one down there.

280
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:09,598
The red one.

281
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,534
Can I have them! Please!

282
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:25,188
Playing on Gould's famous and
favorite Steinway piano,

283
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,556
we have a treat for you.

284
00:37:26,558 --> 00:37:29,659
16 year old musical star Marika
Bournaki

285
00:37:29,661 --> 00:37:33,162
will perform the prelude of
Johan Sebastian Bach.

286
00:37:33,164 --> 00:37:36,131
English Suite ♪2 in F minor.

287
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:58,106
Well we have the same taste in
sunglasses I mean...

288
00:40:15,988 --> 00:40:19,889
She remembers me from earlier
than I remember her.

289
00:40:19,891 --> 00:40:20,689
No!

290
00:40:20,691 --> 00:40:24,659
Yeah!

291
00:40:28,364 --> 00:40:30,097
Did you think he was cute when
you first saw him?

292
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:34,234
No... of course!

293
00:40:36,137 --> 00:40:39,171
What was your first impression
when you saw her?

294
00:40:39,173 --> 00:40:41,573
This is becoming a love story!

295
00:40:41,575 --> 00:40:45,509
Nothing special...

296
00:40:56,553 --> 00:41:00,554
I came to New York because I
knew that Marika was...

297
00:41:02,391 --> 00:41:05,658
Good!

298
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:09,528
We met in pre college.

299
00:41:14,667 --> 00:41:16,266
Stop!

300
00:41:16,268 --> 00:41:20,236
Now I'll just go on my knees
and ask her to marry me.

301
00:41:21,505 --> 00:41:25,473
No.

302
00:41:56,332 --> 00:41:59,833
I've never seen my dad play in
this kind of setting ever.

303
00:41:59,835 --> 00:42:02,235
So this is a first.

304
00:42:02,237 --> 00:42:06,205
I'm excited.

305
00:42:07,808 --> 00:42:10,675
See, now he's nervous, he's
practicing!

306
00:42:12,512 --> 00:42:15,679
Yeah, what about me when I want
to warm up.

307
00:42:15,681 --> 00:42:19,549
I have to scout pianos in
hotels.

308
00:42:26,324 --> 00:42:30,425
When you're a pianist, you sit
at the piano.

309
00:42:30,427 --> 00:42:33,294
But I remember, when I was
younger,

310
00:42:33,296 --> 00:42:35,829
like when my knees were shaking

311
00:42:35,831 --> 00:42:38,164
when you're standing up...

312
00:42:38,166 --> 00:42:42,201
You feel them much more than
when you're sitting.

313
00:44:17,242 --> 00:44:19,375
It's like a job interview.

314
00:44:19,377 --> 00:44:22,444
If an important agent books you
anywhere in the world

315
00:44:22,446 --> 00:44:25,880
that's your start in your
career.

316
00:44:25,882 --> 00:44:29,750
So yes it's potentially a
career maker.

317
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:35,054
What if I suck?

318
00:44:35,056 --> 00:44:38,757
Well, they'll either say,

319
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:43,027
thank you very much or they'll
say

320
00:44:43,029 --> 00:44:46,863
even if you sucked it sounded
pretty good.

321
00:45:06,547 --> 00:45:10,481
House management.

322
00:45:24,093 --> 00:45:25,759
I'm so fucking tired.

323
00:46:44,955 --> 00:46:49,090
I told them two beds.

324
00:47:53,908 --> 00:47:57,742
If you want we can try to
change but...

325
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:09,885
I don't think you realize how
dirty this is.

326
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,987
Like, let me complain.

327
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:13,788
Do you see how dirty this is?

328
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:15,289
Do you see how this is dirty?

329
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:18,925
Do you see how dirty this is!

330
00:48:18,927 --> 00:48:21,160
I've never stayed in a place
like this.

331
00:48:21,162 --> 00:48:25,329
How am I supposed... how am I
supposed to sleep...

332
00:48:25,331 --> 00:48:28,098
it's the same crap, it's just
because it's brown

333
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,999
that you can't see it.

334
00:48:30,001 --> 00:48:31,700
It's so fucking ghetto.

335
00:48:31,702 --> 00:48:35,570
Like what the fuck.

336
00:48:51,518 --> 00:48:55,452
Where's the light?

337
00:49:52,832 --> 00:49:55,098
Yesterday she didn't sleep at
all

338
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:58,768
so we basically went through
two days without sleeping.

339
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:00,202
And she got her period yesterday

340
00:50:00,204 --> 00:50:04,239
so that added a little bit to
the whole...

341
00:50:05,842 --> 00:50:09,810
emotional.

342
00:50:25,057 --> 00:50:27,157
The most famous square in
London.

343
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:31,427
The Trafalgar Square.

344
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,832
I'm hungry,

345
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:41,735
I don't care about the Palace.

346
00:50:44,473 --> 00:50:48,674
I can't even frickin visit it
so there's no point.

347
00:50:48,676 --> 00:50:50,108
I know, we can't visit it.

348
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:54,245
The frickin Queen's in it.

349
00:51:04,454 --> 00:51:08,522
This is so creepy, I don't like
this.

350
00:51:10,259 --> 00:51:13,393
Me and David, that was my
boyfriend everyday,

351
00:51:13,395 --> 00:51:15,495
I'd see him everyday and when I
leave,

352
00:51:15,497 --> 00:51:19,731
I feel like I'm leaving
somebody behind but I mean,

353
00:51:19,733 --> 00:51:21,933
that's fine, like I'm in London,

354
00:51:21,935 --> 00:51:25,803
what the hell. Why am I
complaining?

355
00:51:27,473 --> 00:51:30,140
I was just thinking like the
image of a college student

356
00:51:30,142 --> 00:51:34,077
is like jeans and a big
sweatshirt.

357
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:35,878
Like more relaxed.

358
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:36,945
You know like comfort.

359
00:51:36,947 --> 00:51:39,514
So it's kind of like...

360
00:51:39,516 --> 00:51:43,050
In a way, for you, you dress
like this

361
00:51:43,052 --> 00:51:44,718
just the way you want everyday.

362
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,585
I mean it's stages.

363
00:51:45,587 --> 00:51:46,886
When you have a concert,

364
00:51:46,888 --> 00:51:48,621
Ya have to have like you know,

365
00:51:48,623 --> 00:51:49,521
it's like Superman.

366
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:53,224
You put your suit on.

367
00:51:53,226 --> 00:51:55,025
Cat woman I would like to say.

368
00:51:55,027 --> 00:51:58,895
Okay, Cat woman. Sorry about
that.

369
00:51:58,897 --> 00:52:00,897
No but I'm talking about my
personal style.

370
00:52:00,899 --> 00:52:05,901
Concert is not... well it
should be but...

371
00:52:05,903 --> 00:52:07,636
Yeah, no it should be,

372
00:52:07,638 --> 00:52:09,537
because I also think you're
making a statement

373
00:52:09,539 --> 00:52:12,540
when you dress a certain way
when you play a concert.

374
00:52:21,215 --> 00:52:25,349
It looks really bad.

375
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:28,885
It looks cheap, this looks
cheap.

376
00:52:28,887 --> 00:52:32,321
It looks like a maid outfit.

377
00:52:32,323 --> 00:52:34,489
I don't want to look for concert
clothes it pisses me off.

378
00:52:34,491 --> 00:52:37,225
Everytime I played people have
told me I look fine.

379
00:52:37,227 --> 00:52:39,493
I don't undertand this frickin
obsession.

380
00:52:39,495 --> 00:52:41,995
There's no obsession, I look
fine.

381
00:52:41,997 --> 00:52:44,731
Okay I have pretty blond hair,
it's fine.

382
00:52:44,733 --> 00:52:48,667
Leave me alone.

383
00:53:22,595 --> 00:53:26,630
One of the questions they'll
probably ask you is

384
00:53:28,433 --> 00:53:31,500
why do you want to be a concert
pianist?

385
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:36,471
What do you enjoy about being a
concert pianist?

386
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:41,308
Nothing.

387
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:43,476
Well, do you enjoy the
practicing?

388
00:53:43,478 --> 00:53:44,477
Yeah.

389
00:53:44,479 --> 00:53:48,514
Okay, so that's one part of the
answer.

390
00:53:49,717 --> 00:53:52,184
What else?

391
00:53:52,186 --> 00:53:54,019
I can bullshit but that's about
it.

392
00:53:54,021 --> 00:53:56,488
Okay. So what's the bullshit.

393
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:57,655
That I like to perform,

394
00:53:57,657 --> 00:54:00,824
that I like to get a right for
a performance.

395
00:54:00,826 --> 00:54:03,092
I'm very motivated,

396
00:54:03,094 --> 00:54:06,528
I want to communicate something
to the public.

397
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:09,397
I'm not just playing for myself
and my practice room

398
00:54:09,399 --> 00:54:11,999
but finally it's kind of like
the gratification

399
00:54:12,001 --> 00:54:14,301
of when you get to play for the
public.

400
00:54:14,303 --> 00:54:15,969
You have to play for other
people,

401
00:54:15,971 --> 00:54:18,504
share what you've been working
on.

402
00:54:18,506 --> 00:54:20,105
Actually it's funny because
this was your answer

403
00:54:20,107 --> 00:54:22,006
you would give when you were
like 13 years old.

404
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:26,143
I know but that's because I
was...

405
00:54:26,145 --> 00:54:27,944
You were more mature then than
now?

406
00:54:27,946 --> 00:54:29,645
No, I wasn't mature I was set
up.

407
00:54:29,647 --> 00:54:31,079
You set me up.

408
00:54:31,081 --> 00:54:31,879
I set you up?

409
00:54:31,881 --> 00:54:33,180
Yeah I had like...

410
00:54:33,182 --> 00:54:35,015
I never told you...

411
00:54:35,017 --> 00:54:36,416
Yeah you did, well kind of.

412
00:54:36,418 --> 00:54:38,885
I had like a written answer to
say.

413
00:54:38,887 --> 00:54:41,787
Like it's kind of how it's
tweeked.

414
00:54:41,789 --> 00:54:44,022
Now it's not how I feel at all.

415
00:54:44,024 --> 00:54:45,256
I don't want to travel,

416
00:54:45,258 --> 00:54:48,626
I don't want... I see it as the
compromise.

417
00:54:48,628 --> 00:54:50,561
I like to play for myself.

418
00:54:50,563 --> 00:54:51,762
I like to learn.

419
00:54:51,764 --> 00:54:54,364
Is this because you're attached
to much to New York?

420
00:54:54,366 --> 00:54:56,566
No! It has nothing to do with
that.

421
00:54:56,568 --> 00:54:58,067
It just has to do with that

422
00:54:58,069 --> 00:54:59,668
I'm not twelve anymore

423
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:01,169
and it's not about playing

424
00:55:01,171 --> 00:55:03,004
and signing autographs

425
00:55:03,006 --> 00:55:04,705
and like thinking I'm so cool

426
00:55:04,707 --> 00:55:06,740
because I'm going to places

427
00:55:06,742 --> 00:55:08,441
and I'm missing school.

428
00:55:08,443 --> 00:55:09,608
You know it's like...

429
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:11,476
I like "la petite vie".

430
00:55:11,478 --> 00:55:14,178
I like my routine, I like to
practice,

431
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:18,515
I like to play for a couple of
people.

432
00:55:18,517 --> 00:55:22,451
I'm not like a rock star.

433
00:55:52,143 --> 00:55:53,909
I think there are some
challenges

434
00:55:53,911 --> 00:55:57,212
as a woman that you don't have
as a man.

435
00:55:57,214 --> 00:55:58,379
I've noticed for example

436
00:55:58,381 --> 00:56:02,416
that since she's been dating
David that...

437
00:56:04,453 --> 00:56:05,718
especially I've had the chance
to see them together,

438
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,853
so it's nice I mean look...

439
00:56:07,855 --> 00:56:09,855
she has to go through those
things,

440
00:56:09,857 --> 00:56:13,758
that's what life is all about.

441
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,661
But clearly, when you get...

442
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:20,963
how do I put it...

443
00:56:20,965 --> 00:56:24,966
emotional but in a soft way,

444
00:56:24,968 --> 00:56:28,802
I think it takes a bit some of
your edge off

445
00:56:33,341 --> 00:56:35,874
from what you're doing, career
wise.

446
00:56:35,876 --> 00:56:39,210
I don't sound like a
professional yet.

447
00:56:39,212 --> 00:56:40,911
You don't?

448
00:56:40,913 --> 00:56:42,979
No. I still sound like a
teenager.

449
00:56:42,981 --> 00:56:46,715
So then, why would they want to
book you?

450
00:56:46,717 --> 00:56:50,285
I don't know, based on what?

451
00:56:50,287 --> 00:56:54,555
Okay well, if you feel you're
not ready yet,

452
00:56:54,557 --> 00:56:55,889
so why are you here?

453
00:56:55,891 --> 00:56:57,490
I don't know, you tell me.

454
00:56:57,492 --> 00:57:01,460
I tell you?!

455
00:57:19,776 --> 00:57:23,744
Don't clap.

456
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:35,720
Shut up!

457
00:57:43,529 --> 00:57:45,829
Tell me what your strategy is
right now...

458
00:57:45,831 --> 00:57:48,765
Strategy? In terms of what?

459
00:57:48,767 --> 00:57:50,566
Keeping her prepared.

460
00:57:50,568 --> 00:57:53,569
Basically I just want to keep
her as calm as possible.

461
00:58:17,991 --> 00:58:22,126
I think I'm getting sick.

462
00:58:26,998 --> 00:58:28,330
This is Marika Bournaki

463
00:58:28,332 --> 00:58:31,999
I'm supposed to be playing in
the hall this morning?

464
00:58:32,001 --> 00:58:36,136
Okay thank you.

465
00:58:51,983 --> 00:58:54,049
We got some good feedback.

466
00:58:54,051 --> 00:58:56,551
They want to establish a good
relationship,

467
00:58:56,553 --> 00:58:59,954
trust, and plan ahead

468
00:58:59,956 --> 00:59:03,724
because it's not going to be a
short...

469
00:59:03,726 --> 00:59:06,359
Invest, invest in the future.

470
00:59:06,361 --> 00:59:08,627
And they were giving an example
of an artist

471
00:59:08,629 --> 00:59:10,695
that they've taken on,

472
00:59:10,697 --> 00:59:13,030
I think it was in 2002,

473
00:59:13,032 --> 00:59:16,866
and that is just starting now
to really emerge.

474
00:59:18,603 --> 00:59:20,336
So as an example of how they'd
like to invest

475
00:59:20,338 --> 00:59:27,342
for the longer term and take
things...

476
00:59:27,344 --> 00:59:28,943
not necessarily at a slow pace

477
00:59:28,945 --> 00:59:32,846
but take time to build a
career.

478
00:59:37,151 --> 00:59:39,618
So are you proud of Marika?

479
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:40,752
Sorry?

480
00:59:40,754 --> 00:59:41,919
Proud.

481
00:59:41,921 --> 00:59:42,920
Oh of course I'm proud,

482
00:59:42,922 --> 00:59:46,556
I'm always proud of her.

483
00:59:46,558 --> 00:59:50,492
She did good today.

484
01:00:12,277 --> 01:00:14,043
I haven't been in Montreal for
summer

485
01:00:14,045 --> 01:00:16,245
like five years or something.

486
01:00:16,247 --> 01:00:19,281
But I'll be going in and out of
the city but...

487
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:20,982
it's okay.

488
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:23,818
It feels okay. My room is a
mess right now.

489
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:27,120
I have clothes everywhere and
my mom's stuff everywhere

490
01:00:27,122 --> 01:00:30,623
because she's moving out soon...

491
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:32,358
I don't know, it doesn't really

492
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,659
feel like my room because I
haven't been in here

493
01:00:33,661 --> 01:00:37,562
for so long but... it's okay.

494
01:03:12,018 --> 01:03:15,786
Well my parents officially got
divorced

495
01:03:15,788 --> 01:03:17,120
in April officially,

496
01:03:17,122 --> 01:03:19,755
but they've been talking about
it since September.

497
01:03:19,757 --> 01:03:21,156
And it was actually really funny

498
01:03:21,158 --> 01:03:23,658
because just like two nights ago

499
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:25,159
we actually talked about it

500
01:03:25,161 --> 01:03:27,094
and nobody has talked about it

501
01:03:27,096 --> 01:03:30,063
and it's like, anytime I come
home,

502
01:03:30,065 --> 01:03:33,466
you know my mom kind of blamed
me a little about...

503
01:03:33,468 --> 01:03:34,700
"since you've been gone

504
01:03:34,702 --> 01:03:35,767
everything's been different"

505
01:03:35,769 --> 01:03:39,236
you know stuff like that.

506
01:06:07,986 --> 01:06:09,752
Why are you using this edition?

507
01:06:09,754 --> 01:06:13,822
Because I lost my other music.

508
01:06:13,824 --> 01:06:15,657
Until I was like 14,

509
01:06:15,659 --> 01:06:18,793
in my head I was never going to
get married,

510
01:06:18,795 --> 01:06:20,094
I was never going to have kids

511
01:06:20,096 --> 01:06:24,131
I was going to be like the
coolest person ever.

512
01:06:29,036 --> 01:06:33,237
But then that changed!

513
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:34,538
You know I was so impatient,

514
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:35,872
that's one thing I learned from
David,

515
01:06:35,874 --> 01:06:37,773
I became I think much more
patient,

516
01:06:37,775 --> 01:06:40,475
my teacher said it really,

517
01:06:40,477 --> 01:06:42,543
tamed... calm me down.

518
01:06:42,545 --> 01:06:43,410
Really grounded me.

519
01:06:43,412 --> 01:06:47,046
And it's true.

520
01:06:47,048 --> 01:06:48,080
I feel like it should be easier

521
01:06:48,082 --> 01:06:49,981
that we do the same thing

522
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:52,016
because we have the same
responsibilities

523
01:06:52,018 --> 01:06:56,153
towards our craft.

524
01:06:59,991 --> 01:07:01,490
For me music is the greatest

525
01:07:01,492 --> 01:07:04,526
and I get the chance to share
it with other people

526
01:07:04,528 --> 01:07:07,529
and it doesn't matter if it's
Carnegie Hall

527
01:07:07,531 --> 01:07:09,130
or if it's for two...

528
01:07:09,132 --> 01:07:11,065
Sounds just like me!

529
01:07:11,067 --> 01:07:13,067
...people, you know, some old
people

530
01:07:13,069 --> 01:07:14,635
or some people that don't
understand

531
01:07:14,637 --> 01:07:18,038
as long as I manage to give
them the maximum

532
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:20,607
I can then even if one person
from the audience

533
01:07:20,609 --> 01:07:24,844
comes to me says you know I
actually felt something...

534
01:07:24,846 --> 01:07:26,478
that's what I care.

535
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,613
And if that brings me to some
place

536
01:07:28,615 --> 01:07:31,616
better to a higher level

537
01:07:31,618 --> 01:07:35,653
that means that it's the way
it's supposed to be.

538
01:07:41,926 --> 01:07:45,827
I am going to YCA office,

539
01:07:45,829 --> 01:07:50,030
which I hope won't be a problem
because it's Saturday.

540
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:54,100
I'm just going to drop off my
CDs.

541
01:07:55,937 --> 01:07:56,735
YCA, Young Concert Artist,

542
01:07:56,737 --> 01:08:00,605
organizes auditions every year

543
01:08:02,275 --> 01:08:03,907
for the people that they name
as winners

544
01:08:03,909 --> 01:08:06,042
they really help to make it to
the next step

545
01:08:06,044 --> 01:08:10,012
of getting major management in
their careers.

546
01:08:10,014 --> 01:08:14,082
This is so creepy you can see
inside.

547
01:08:15,952 --> 01:08:17,952
It can be very important if you
win,

548
01:08:17,954 --> 01:08:20,521
you know you have winners of
these auditions

549
01:08:20,523 --> 01:08:24,858
that became very successful
artists.

550
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:25,959
The jury will ask you which
piece

551
01:08:25,961 --> 01:08:27,327
you would like to perform first

552
01:08:27,329 --> 01:08:28,661
then they will request other
works.

553
01:08:28,663 --> 01:08:32,564
The audition all together is
about fifteen minutes.

554
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:34,299
So, my point is that...

555
01:08:34,301 --> 01:08:38,336
coming back to Bach, is that
you know...

556
01:08:53,616 --> 01:08:54,548
You shouldn't. You shouldn't.

557
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:55,282
Are you kidding me?

558
01:08:55,284 --> 01:08:57,117
I'm not kidding you at all.

559
01:08:57,119 --> 01:08:58,384
I'm not kidding at all.

560
01:08:58,386 --> 01:08:59,918
Actually, I think it's a huge
mistake

561
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,354
to play Bach to start with.

562
01:09:03,356 --> 01:09:04,054
Why?

563
01:09:04,056 --> 01:09:06,189
I'll tell you why.

564
01:09:06,191 --> 01:09:07,823
Because, you know, this is a
fifteen minute audition.

565
01:09:07,825 --> 01:09:09,724
You need to make a statement.

566
01:09:09,726 --> 01:09:12,426
You need to impress the jury.

567
01:09:12,428 --> 01:09:14,261
And what would you like me to
make an impression with?

568
01:09:14,263 --> 01:09:16,363
Well I think, in my mind,

569
01:09:16,365 --> 01:09:20,366
you would start with probably a
Rachmaninoff Sonata.

570
01:09:21,469 --> 01:09:23,168
Are you fucking insane?

571
01:09:27,573 --> 01:09:28,238
Do you understand?

572
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:30,273
You have fifteen minutes

573
01:09:30,275 --> 01:09:33,276
to make yourself feel comfortable
and establish yourself.

574
01:09:34,779 --> 01:09:35,878
It's your choice. In the end,

575
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,479
you're the one who decides.

576
01:09:37,481 --> 01:09:39,380
But I'm telling you,

577
01:09:39,382 --> 01:09:42,383
these people will be auditioning
like a hundred people.

578
01:09:54,061 --> 01:09:58,563
I'm not a robot you know

579
01:09:58,565 --> 01:10:04,201
and I think that that's what's
the hardest part you know,

580
01:10:04,203 --> 01:10:06,136
it's kind of you have to put it
on automatic

581
01:10:06,138 --> 01:10:08,138
sometimes without it being
automatic,

582
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:09,405
you know the whole practicing
thing

583
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:13,575
and the whole giving up
everything,

584
01:10:13,577 --> 01:10:17,578
you know life gets in my way
that's what happens to me.

585
01:10:23,251 --> 01:10:24,917
I mean I've been preparing for
YCA for...

586
01:10:24,919 --> 01:10:27,486
very seriously for like a month
in a half.

587
01:10:27,488 --> 01:10:30,555
So you want to do this...

588
01:10:30,557 --> 01:10:34,858
I might mess up or...

589
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:37,961
Any more disclaimers?

590
01:10:37,963 --> 01:10:39,996
No I think that's it.

591
01:10:39,998 --> 01:10:44,032
I might mess up also a lot...
but okay.

592
01:10:44,034 --> 01:10:48,069
Veda she gave me a lesson and I
tell her

593
01:10:49,906 --> 01:10:51,572
well this is coming up in a
week in a half

594
01:10:51,574 --> 01:10:53,640
so and then she freaks out.

595
01:10:53,642 --> 01:10:55,908
This is the problem.

596
01:10:55,910 --> 01:10:57,709
Off camera please.

597
01:10:57,711 --> 01:10:59,544
How can you, why do you do
this...

598
01:10:59,546 --> 01:11:03,480
so then she tested me.

599
01:11:09,687 --> 01:11:13,855
She asked for the things that
were the weakest.

600
01:11:13,857 --> 01:11:17,191
My confidence went all out and
again

601
01:11:17,193 --> 01:11:20,627
I was in this vulnerable
position,

602
01:11:20,629 --> 01:11:22,528
which she always puts me in.

603
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:24,229
When did you play... you
performed this?

604
01:11:24,231 --> 01:11:27,565
Yeah... I played... a lot of
things went wrong?

605
01:11:27,567 --> 01:11:30,668
Yeah...

606
01:11:30,670 --> 01:11:34,671
She proved to me in any way
that I'm not 100% ready.

607
01:11:36,374 --> 01:11:38,073
And like my dad was
disagreeing...

608
01:11:38,075 --> 01:11:40,108
what are you talking about?!

609
01:11:50,985 --> 01:11:52,718
It's not just a business.

610
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:55,153
It's not just about making
money.

611
01:11:55,155 --> 01:11:57,788
It's about more than that.

612
01:11:57,790 --> 01:12:00,423
And once I'm more than that,

613
01:12:00,425 --> 01:12:02,091
that's when it's going to
happen.

614
01:12:02,093 --> 01:12:03,892
So I'm still mad at him.

615
01:12:03,894 --> 01:12:05,994
And he's like yeah but it's
your fault...

616
01:12:05,996 --> 01:12:08,730
It's not my fault, it is my
fault

617
01:12:08,732 --> 01:12:11,132
maybe that I wasn't good enough

618
01:12:11,134 --> 01:12:12,833
maybe it's my fault that I
wasn't prepared

619
01:12:12,835 --> 01:12:14,868
but it's not my fault that he
decided

620
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:17,837
to set up this thing against,

621
01:12:17,839 --> 01:12:19,171
even maybe his better judgment

622
01:12:19,173 --> 01:12:22,674
or against my teachers
judgment.

623
01:12:39,056 --> 01:12:40,622
Sometimes I call him because I
discover

624
01:12:40,624 --> 01:12:44,092
a beautiful thing and I'm
talking to him about it

625
01:12:44,094 --> 01:12:45,526
and he wants to get over to

626
01:12:45,528 --> 01:12:48,228
how was practice how was this,
how was that.

627
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:50,230
You know of course it's because
he cares

628
01:12:50,232 --> 01:12:53,900
and he wants me to be able to
make a career

629
01:12:53,902 --> 01:12:55,301
because he knows how hard it is

630
01:12:55,303 --> 01:12:56,902
and because he lived and didn't
make it

631
01:12:56,904 --> 01:12:58,937
but it's like at some point

632
01:12:58,939 --> 01:13:01,105
you just kind of have to rise
above all

633
01:13:01,107 --> 01:13:02,840
that and you know understand

634
01:13:02,842 --> 01:13:04,942
that it's not about that.

635
01:13:04,944 --> 01:13:06,810
What were you trying to tell
him about?

636
01:13:06,812 --> 01:13:08,945
I was telling him about a song,

637
01:13:08,947 --> 01:13:11,514
a Schumann song,

638
01:13:11,516 --> 01:13:15,217
I was talking to him about
Frauenliebe und leben,

639
01:13:15,219 --> 01:13:17,052
it's a song cycle by Schumann

640
01:13:17,054 --> 01:13:21,121
and I listened to it and I
cried in class

641
01:13:21,123 --> 01:13:23,022
because it was so beautiful

642
01:13:23,024 --> 01:13:26,825
and so sad and I called him to
tell him about that

643
01:13:28,662 --> 01:13:30,762
and he was talking to me about
YCA you know,

644
01:13:30,764 --> 01:13:33,865
and it's like I don't care
about YCA,

645
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:37,868
I don't care.

646
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:39,569
I don't even know why I'm
crying.

647
01:13:39,571 --> 01:13:41,304
But it's true, I don't care.

648
01:13:41,306 --> 01:13:45,374
And it's always about you know,

649
01:13:45,376 --> 01:13:49,344
career and concerts and how people
think I sound and you know,

650
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:53,113
managers and you know,

651
01:13:53,115 --> 01:13:54,848
but it's not about that.

652
01:13:54,850 --> 01:13:58,784
It's so not about that.

653
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:12,595
I know all you are doing is
helping me.

654
01:14:12,597 --> 01:14:16,598
I'm just upset at myself
because apparently...

655
01:14:22,972 --> 01:14:26,373
because I've been working hard

656
01:14:26,375 --> 01:14:28,808
but apparently not hard enough.

657
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:32,711
Or maybe I'm not just good
enough.

658
01:14:32,713 --> 01:14:34,813
So I'm angry at myself.

659
01:14:34,815 --> 01:14:38,249
C'est tout. So I'm sorry,

660
01:14:38,251 --> 01:14:41,385
I feel like a failure yet
again.

661
01:15:19,116 --> 01:15:20,148
What happens is that this
becomes

662
01:15:20,150 --> 01:15:22,216
very very close to this.

663
01:15:22,218 --> 01:15:26,253
Just playing it slightly off
rather than in the middle.

664
01:16:12,224 --> 01:16:13,122
Marika?

665
01:16:20,129 --> 01:16:24,130
Don't worry we have plenty of
time.

666
01:16:30,538 --> 01:16:34,406
What class is this?

667
01:19:06,323 --> 01:19:10,391
My goal now is to make
classical music more accessible.

668
01:19:10,393 --> 01:19:13,227
That is something I can do
because of who I am,

669
01:19:13,229 --> 01:19:15,596
because of my personality,

670
01:19:15,598 --> 01:19:19,099
experimenting with the lighting
and the set design,

671
01:19:19,101 --> 01:19:22,969
projections on stage while I'm
playing,

672
01:19:22,971 --> 01:19:26,038
making concerts more
interactive with the public,

673
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:28,940
with other artists on stage,

674
01:19:28,942 --> 01:19:32,810
playing in centers, playing for
causes,

675
01:19:34,079 --> 01:19:37,213
it's all part of creating and
bringing music

676
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:39,882
and sharing music with
different people

677
01:19:39,884 --> 01:19:43,085
all around the world and
whether it's

678
01:19:43,087 --> 01:19:46,821
again in big classical venues

679
01:19:46,823 --> 01:19:48,489
or if it's in different places

680
01:19:48,491 --> 01:19:50,190
in doesn't matter.

681
01:19:50,192 --> 01:19:51,024
It's really bringing and
sharing things

682
01:19:51,026 --> 01:19:55,161
together through music.

683
01:20:16,779 --> 01:20:20,714
She was as always expected,
amazing.

684
01:20:25,152 --> 01:20:27,852
The brightest and the best.

685
01:20:27,854 --> 01:20:31,722
I think Marika is one of those
people.

686
01:23:06,709 --> 01:23:10,643
I love music.

687
01:23:12,146 --> 01:23:14,312
Maybe I don't always love
practicing,

688
01:23:14,314 --> 01:23:16,013
maybe I don't always love
myself,

689
01:23:16,015 --> 01:23:20,150
but I always love music.

690
01:23:21,653 --> 01:23:22,451
I'm serving something higher,

691
01:23:22,453 --> 01:23:24,753
it's my religion,

692
01:23:24,755 --> 01:23:26,321
I really do believe it's the

693
01:23:26,323 --> 01:23:30,291
most beautiful thing in the
world.

694
01:26:00,473 --> 01:26:05,542
The final scene of the movie.
