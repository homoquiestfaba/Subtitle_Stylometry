1
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:16,581
Mr. Tynes.

2
00:00:16,755 --> 00:00:18,800
He's ready for you.

3
00:00:44,304 --> 00:00:47,960
Dodge Tynes.
Thanks for coming by.

4
00:00:48,134 --> 00:00:50,223
Mr. Sellars,
thanks for seeing me.

5
00:00:50,397 --> 00:00:51,877
My pleasure. Call me Miles.

6
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,053
I wish you could call me Dodge.
What a cool name.

7
00:00:54,227 --> 00:00:55,750
Please, have a seat.

8
00:00:55,924 --> 00:00:57,796
My dad was a car nut.
Worked the line.

9
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,974
Yeah, everyone's dad
in this town worked the line.

10
00:01:02,148 --> 00:01:04,237
My old man welded floor pans.

11
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:06,196
When I was 14, he brought us

12
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,242
all the way here from Austria
looking for the American dream,

13
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:11,462
and damn it if Detroit
didn't give it to him.

14
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:17,685
-You're a Wings fan?
-Yeah.

15
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:19,470
Well, I got Yzerman's stick

16
00:01:19,644 --> 00:01:21,776
hanging above my mantle
in my billiards room.

17
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,909
I used to have Gordie Howe's
jersey hanging in my closet.

18
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,389
Authentic? Game-worn?

19
00:01:25,563 --> 00:01:29,219
Oh, yeah. Had to sell it.

20
00:01:29,393 --> 00:01:31,395
Yeah, well...

21
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:34,746
I had a look
at your medical file;

22
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,576
seems like money's been tight
and luck's been bad.

23
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,708
I'm really sorry you're
going through this, Dodge.

24
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,801
Pain comes with the territory?

25
00:01:46,975 --> 00:01:50,805
Yeah. Yeah, it usually
clears up pretty quick.

26
00:01:55,636 --> 00:01:57,986
Sorry.

27
00:01:58,161 --> 00:02:01,686
Uh...

28
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,949
Look, Miles,
I think you know my story.

29
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:06,169
If I just had some cash,

30
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:10,042
I could maybe get some treatment
to buy me more time,

31
00:02:10,216 --> 00:02:12,653
and, uh,

32
00:02:12,827 --> 00:02:15,178
maybe see my son be born.

33
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:17,049
That's the kind of conversation

34
00:02:17,223 --> 00:02:19,791
-that requires alcohol.

35
00:02:19,965 --> 00:02:21,619
Don't know if I should
in my condition.

36
00:02:21,793 --> 00:02:23,316
In your condition,
you should drink

37
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,884
whatever the hell you want.

38
00:02:28,756 --> 00:02:30,889
It's the good stuff, I promise.

39
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,288
See?

40
00:02:38,462 --> 00:02:39,985
Yeah, I'd ask where you got it,

41
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,682
but I don't have the money
and I'll probably be dead

42
00:02:41,856 --> 00:02:43,510
-before I finished the bottle.
-Come on, kid,

43
00:02:43,684 --> 00:02:44,859
don't talk like that.

44
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:46,774
Pessimism's not gonna help you

45
00:02:46,948 --> 00:02:49,212
or your wife. The good news is,
you're not the first person

46
00:02:49,386 --> 00:02:51,562
to come to The Tiro Fund
in a tough spot.

47
00:02:51,736 --> 00:02:55,522
You think a loan's possible?

48
00:02:55,696 --> 00:02:58,003
I have a building for
collateral, The Carrington.

49
00:03:01,485 --> 00:03:04,749
Well, Dodge,
I really want to help you,

50
00:03:04,923 --> 00:03:07,012
and I think I can,

51
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:10,624
but I know The Carrington.
It's unfinished, unfunded.

52
00:03:10,798 --> 00:03:13,627
I'd be the fourth
lienholder in line.

53
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:16,151
I just can't loan the kind of
money we're talking about

54
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:18,980
to someone who very likely
might pass away

55
00:03:19,154 --> 00:03:21,244
before he can even think
about paying me back.

56
00:03:22,854 --> 00:03:25,422
Now, I know that makes me sound
like a bastard.

57
00:03:25,596 --> 00:03:28,947
I promise I'm not. It's just...

58
00:03:29,121 --> 00:03:31,732
I lost family members to cancer.

59
00:03:31,906 --> 00:03:34,039
I've seen how unforgiving
it can be.

60
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:37,172
Yeah, it's okay. I get it.

61
00:03:37,347 --> 00:03:40,611
So, what, you still think
you can help me somehow?

62
00:03:40,785 --> 00:03:42,090
I do.

63
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:44,528
But I can't do it alone.
I need your help,

64
00:03:44,702 --> 00:03:46,094
your participation.

65
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:48,488
Participation, how?

66
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:53,014
Dodge, I am what you would
call a facilitator.

67
00:03:53,188 --> 00:03:55,669
I make possible
the natural progression

68
00:03:55,843 --> 00:03:58,803
of man's innate desire
to be challenged.

69
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:02,546
Right. Well, what does this
have to do with me?

70
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,854
You see, I represent
a very exclusive, very wealthy

71
00:04:07,028 --> 00:04:11,424
clientele who pay exorbitant
fees for a unique,

72
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:13,078
one-of-a-kind experience

73
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:16,821
in a highly intense sport...

74
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:18,823
hunting.

75
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:22,522
And that's where your
participation becomes integral.

76
00:04:25,003 --> 00:04:26,874
You'd want them to hunt me?

77
00:04:28,354 --> 00:04:30,008
Like paintball?

78
00:04:34,882 --> 00:04:36,667
Like tag or something?

79
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:43,326
Like you'd hunt an animal?

80
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:48,156
The sport in its purest form.

81
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:51,334
A hunt to kill.

82
00:04:51,508 --> 00:04:54,467
Fuck me, you're serious.

83
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:57,731
Now I can see in your face you
want to just run out of here,

84
00:04:57,905 --> 00:04:59,820
and you're welcome to do so,

85
00:04:59,994 --> 00:05:03,389
only you'd be leaving
as poor as you came.

86
00:05:03,563 --> 00:05:06,000
Or you can hear me out
and help your family

87
00:05:06,174 --> 00:05:10,265
in a way that was unimaginable
five minutes ago.

88
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,137
You hunt innocent humans?

89
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:16,620
No, we hunt desperate humans,
with no glimmer of hope.

90
00:05:16,794 --> 00:05:20,711
We provide optimism,
not just to people like you.

91
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:23,191
For the most part,
our hunters have snatched

92
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:25,672
all the brass rings
life can offer.

93
00:05:25,846 --> 00:05:28,066
We give them a challenge.

94
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,677
They're not going after
paunchy 40-year-olds

95
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:32,070
with bad knees.

96
00:05:32,244 --> 00:05:34,420
They battle physical specimens.

97
00:05:34,594 --> 00:05:37,554
We satisfy their need to strive.

98
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:40,687
Not to mention
what you'd be doing for me.

99
00:05:40,861 --> 00:05:43,298
-For you?
-I'd be helping you

100
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:46,127
and your wife
and your unborn child.

101
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:49,174
You know, really helping
a family in crisis.

102
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,002
What I do for a living

103
00:05:51,176 --> 00:05:54,092
doesn't provide much opportunity
to feel good about myself.

104
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:57,269
No, I can't imagine it does.

105
00:05:57,443 --> 00:05:58,923
Listen, I'm gonna go
to the cops.

106
00:05:59,097 --> 00:06:01,926
To tell them what?
You'd sound deranged,

107
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,189
and you'd be able
to prove nothing.

108
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,539
We'll see.

109
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,849
You could leave
your family millions.

110
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:22,729
Dodge.

111
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:26,037
How many times

112
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:28,953
since your diagnosis have you
told yourself you'd do anything

113
00:06:29,127 --> 00:06:32,217
to make sure your family's
secure after you're gone?

114
00:06:36,308 --> 00:06:39,311
Well, this is your chance
to "do anything."

115
00:06:42,793 --> 00:06:45,143
If you want to hear more,

116
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:48,146
I'll be finishing my drink
on the balcony.

117
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:17,262
Dodge Tynes coming on strong,

118
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:20,874
passing Vanderbilt's Wilson,
leaving Notre Dame behind.

119
00:07:21,048 --> 00:07:23,660
They're all just spectators now.

120
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:25,662
He's breaking from the pack,

121
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:27,359
extending his lead
with every step.

122
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:28,882
Into the final turn.

123
00:07:29,056 --> 00:07:30,928
Nothing but daylight
ahead of him.

124
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:33,931
Dodge Tynes wins the 400!

125
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:36,629
45.46 seconds,

126
00:07:36,803 --> 00:07:40,590
a new University of Michigan
record.

127
00:07:40,764 --> 00:07:42,809
Put it in the books.
Dodge Tynes.

128
00:07:42,983 --> 00:07:46,944
The unrecruited walk-on
is nothing but a winner.

129
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:20,401
-Hey, you.
-Hey, you.

130
00:10:20,575 --> 00:10:23,230
-You want some breakfast?
-Ooh.

131
00:10:23,404 --> 00:10:25,015
Why, thank you.

132
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:27,321
An omelet, blueberries,
toast, coffee.

133
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,890
Oh. Oh, God.

134
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:32,413
-No good?
-Oh, my God.

135
00:10:32,587 --> 00:10:35,373
-Oh, my God.
-I thought eggs were okay.

136
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:37,723
-It's the butter.
-Oh, boy.

137
00:10:37,897 --> 00:10:39,464
-Shit.

138
00:10:39,638 --> 00:10:41,640
I'm sorry, babe. I thought
you were cool with dairy.

139
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,515
You okay?

140
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,996
I amokay with dairy.

141
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,346
It's little Thumper
that's not okay with dairy.

142
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,305
Or chicken or anything green.

143
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:56,002
Thank you.
That was sweet, though.

144
00:10:56,176 --> 00:10:58,570
Thanks for the vomity kiss.
That's nice.

145
00:10:58,744 --> 00:11:00,572
Hey, do you think we can
get to the crib this week?

146
00:11:00,746 --> 00:11:02,922
I got to get that box
out of the foyer already.

147
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:05,577
-Yes. I'll do the crib.
-And the loose brick.

148
00:11:05,751 --> 00:11:07,666
Every time you step on it,
it just comes right off.

149
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,624
The crib, the loose brick,
everything else,

150
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,931
it's all gonna get done once
I'm through with these pitches.

151
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,455
I know.
And you're gonna be great.

152
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:15,935
You're always great.

153
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:18,503
Hey. Don't hide things
from me, okay?

154
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,157
I found the bills.

155
00:11:20,331 --> 00:11:21,636
I wasn't hiding them from you,

156
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:23,247
I just want you to focus
on your job.

157
00:11:23,421 --> 00:11:25,640
I'm focused. Okay?
And I have some great leads.

158
00:11:25,815 --> 00:11:28,295
And I'm gonna get the financing.

159
00:11:28,469 --> 00:11:30,733
I got to go.

160
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:32,473
Hey.

161
00:11:34,562 --> 00:11:38,001
$1,238.48.

162
00:11:38,175 --> 00:11:40,612
That's what we had
when we got married.

163
00:11:40,786 --> 00:11:42,832
Negative $220,

164
00:11:43,006 --> 00:11:44,659
our net worth when we bought
this shell of a house

165
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:47,314
and renovated it
from the ground up.

166
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:50,230
We built a life together.

167
00:11:50,404 --> 00:11:52,406
We're gonna be fine.

168
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,582
Yeah, I know.

169
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,890
$220,000 in debt.

170
00:11:58,064 --> 00:12:00,240
-The good old days, huh?

171
00:12:03,853 --> 00:12:05,289
I love you.

172
00:12:07,552 --> 00:12:09,989
Mr. Pierce,
I appreciate your time.

173
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:11,643
So, let me get
right to it, all right?

174
00:12:11,817 --> 00:12:13,906
Your building?
It's a sinking ship.

175
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,690
All right? Matter of fact,
it's already underwater

176
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:17,431
and filled with holes.

177
00:12:17,605 --> 00:12:19,956
But that doesn't mean
it can't be salvaged.

178
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,609
Distressed asset investment.

179
00:12:21,784 --> 00:12:23,786
That's what put all this marble
under our feet.

180
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,222
-So...
-Exactly. And as you can see

181
00:12:25,396 --> 00:12:27,572
-from the prospectus...
-I don't invest

182
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:31,054
in something based on drawings
about how something could be.

183
00:12:31,228 --> 00:12:34,144
I only invest based
on what something is now.

184
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:36,146
So please, bring me back
the real numbers, all right?

185
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,191
Warts and all.
And give me your best shot.

186
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:40,019
All right?
Bring me those numbers.

187
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,629
I got to go.

188
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,634
To the future Prince Tynes.

189
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:49,463
Lucky bastard.
Three times, all girls.

190
00:12:49,637 --> 00:12:51,030
Even the dog is female.

191
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,946
And you find out
yours has a wang. Unfair.

192
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,644
Please. You love being
surrounded by Daddy's girls.

193
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:59,212
I do, but sometimes
I just want someone

194
00:12:59,386 --> 00:13:01,127
to watch football and fart with.

195
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:02,825
Oh, you won't do that
with him, Janice?

196
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:04,609
Seriously, man, what a blessing.

197
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:06,916
You've got an heir
to the throne.

198
00:13:09,396 --> 00:13:10,441
I'll be right back.

199
00:13:16,577 --> 00:13:19,232
Hey, when you pee in my alley,
the bums get confused

200
00:13:19,406 --> 00:13:21,800
because they already marked
their territory.

201
00:13:23,671 --> 00:13:25,369
All right, man,
what's the problem?

202
00:13:25,543 --> 00:13:27,893
How am I supposed to have
an heir to the throne

203
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:30,504
when all I have to pass on
is a mountain of debt?

204
00:13:30,678 --> 00:13:32,811
D, I know things are bad.

205
00:13:32,985 --> 00:13:34,291
I put everything I had
in The Carrington.

206
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:36,032
Not to mention
what other people had, too.

207
00:13:36,206 --> 00:13:40,384
Hey, I'm not some investor
whose money you lost.

208
00:13:40,558 --> 00:13:42,690
I'm your best friend...

209
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:46,042
whose money you lost.

210
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:48,174
It's not funny, man.
It's killing me.

211
00:13:48,348 --> 00:13:49,784
I'm not thrilled about it,
either.

212
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,612
I mean, I don't know
if you noticed,

213
00:13:51,786 --> 00:13:53,876
but this place is not
exactly a gold mine.

214
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,356
50K is a lot of money to me,

215
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:59,359
but I only want it back
when you can swing it.

216
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:06,192
Look at her. Van Buren Motors.

217
00:14:06,366 --> 00:14:07,933
Back in the day,
when that sign was all lit up,

218
00:14:08,107 --> 00:14:10,153
you could see it
from anywhere in the city.

219
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:13,721
You remember that summer,

220
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:15,462
when your old man
had us working the Paint Room?

221
00:14:15,636 --> 00:14:19,510
Yeah, we brought Penny,
uh, P-Penny

222
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:20,990
-what's her, what's her name?
-Penny Talesco.

223
00:14:21,164 --> 00:14:22,556
-Penny Talesco.
-And Tammy Polnechek.

224
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,690
My dad catches us smoking

225
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:27,692
his Chesterfields
in the underground tunnels.

226
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:29,302
Yeah, I thought he was
gonna have a coronary.

227
00:14:29,476 --> 00:14:31,000
Well, yeah.

228
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:32,653
If any paint fumes had gotten
in those tunnels,

229
00:14:32,827 --> 00:14:34,438
we would've blown up
half the factory.

230
00:14:34,612 --> 00:14:36,135
-Stupid.

231
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:37,441
Yeah, but fun.

232
00:14:37,615 --> 00:14:41,227
Look, man,
better times are coming.

233
00:14:41,401 --> 00:14:43,577
Just hang in there.

234
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:46,537
Now I got to go check
on the kegs.

235
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:47,930
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

236
00:14:48,104 --> 00:14:49,235
-Yeah?
-I'm okay.

237
00:14:49,409 --> 00:14:50,541
If I have to come back out here,

238
00:14:50,715 --> 00:14:51,934
you got to name
your baby Looger.

239
00:15:29,884 --> 00:15:31,799
-Mrs. Tynes.
-Where is my husband?

240
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,976
I found him on my beat.
Doctors can tell you more,

241
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,455
but right now he's alert
and okay.

242
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:36,979
I'll take you to him.

243
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:39,024
This way.

244
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,509
He's right in there.

245
00:15:45,683 --> 00:15:48,164
Thank you.

246
00:15:48,338 --> 00:15:51,602
-What happened?
-Hey. I'm okay.

247
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:52,907
I'm okay.

248
00:15:53,082 --> 00:15:54,997
Police called.
I was so scared.

249
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:57,086
DR.
Mr. and Mrs. Tynes?

250
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,524
This is Dr. Carlton Levy
and I'm Dr. Rajiv Singhal.

251
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:04,876
So, uh, what the hell's
going on?

252
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:08,053
One minute I'm at the bus,
next minute I wake up in here.

253
00:16:08,227 --> 00:16:10,273
Mr. Tynes,
have you been experiencing

254
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:12,449
any headaches lately?

255
00:16:14,712 --> 00:16:16,322
Yeah.

256
00:16:16,496 --> 00:16:17,758
Yeah, pretty bad ones.

257
00:16:17,932 --> 00:16:21,458
Well, this is your CT.

258
00:16:22,894 --> 00:16:26,463
This mass is a,
it's a glioblastoma,

259
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:29,379
an aggressive tumor.

260
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:33,818
It's malignant and,
because of its location,

261
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:35,428
inoperable.

262
00:16:35,602 --> 00:16:38,214
Uh, this has to be wrong.

263
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:40,564
He runs, like,
six miles every day.

264
00:16:40,738 --> 00:16:43,219
Mrs. Tynes,
we're lucky to have Dr. Levy

265
00:16:43,393 --> 00:16:44,785
as a visiting attending.

266
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,483
He's one of the top
oncological surgeons

267
00:16:46,657 --> 00:16:48,354
at Sloan Kettering.

268
00:16:48,528 --> 00:16:51,662
We both concur on the diagnosis.

269
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:55,318
DR.
I wish we were wrong,
but unfortunately,

270
00:16:55,492 --> 00:16:57,363
we're not.

271
00:17:03,152 --> 00:17:05,284
I don't care what they say.

272
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,939
We'll see every
specialist there is,

273
00:17:08,113 --> 00:17:10,246
go to the Mayo Clinic, Cedars...

274
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,465
With what, Val?
I have no insurance.

275
00:17:12,639 --> 00:17:15,512
-Yes, you do.
-No. No, you and the baby do.

276
00:17:15,686 --> 00:17:17,818
I took myself
off the policy months ago.

277
00:17:17,992 --> 00:17:19,777
Why would you do that?

278
00:17:21,605 --> 00:17:23,607
Because we have no money, Val.

279
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:33,356
I'm all right. I'm all right.

280
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,706
Listen, man, I'm, uh,

281
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,622
I'm real sorry you're
going through all this.

282
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:41,233
Here.

283
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:43,627
There's this company always
leaving those at the hospital.

284
00:17:43,801 --> 00:17:46,195
They say they help
sick people in trouble.

285
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:48,588
Maybe they can help you.

286
00:17:50,721 --> 00:17:54,725
Weeks? Weeks?

287
00:17:54,899 --> 00:17:57,467
Val and I haven't
had enough time together.

288
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:02,950
I'm angry.

289
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,779
I'm angry I'm gonna die.

290
00:18:05,953 --> 00:18:10,349
I'm angry my son won't know me.

291
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:12,090
I'm angry this

292
00:18:12,264 --> 00:18:16,573
fucking tumor's taking me
from my family.

293
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:21,055
There's options, you know, um,

294
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,709
holistic stuff.

295
00:18:22,883 --> 00:18:25,190
I was watching TV the other day
and this guy said

296
00:18:25,364 --> 00:18:28,367
if you drink aloe, it does
something to the pH in your body

297
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,326
and it kills the cancer, or, um,

298
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,110
tents where you
sweat out the toxins,

299
00:18:32,284 --> 00:18:33,198
or, I don't know,

300
00:18:33,372 --> 00:18:34,982
there's healing crystals,

301
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,854
or Reiki, or acupuncture.

302
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:40,031
I just think...
You know, we try other stuff.

303
00:18:40,205 --> 00:18:43,730
We don't, we don't just
accept this. There's options.

304
00:18:57,657 --> 00:19:00,182
In my experience,
it's best if I talk for a while

305
00:19:00,356 --> 00:19:02,401
and you just listen
with an open mind.

306
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:05,143
Can you do that for me, Dodge?

307
00:19:09,974 --> 00:19:13,760
So here's how you'll be hunted.

308
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:18,983
It's a 24-hour hunt.

309
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:20,637
Every hour you survive,

310
00:19:20,811 --> 00:19:23,422
more money is being wired
into your bank account,

311
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:25,511
and that continues
until the game ends.

312
00:19:25,685 --> 00:19:29,123
You survive the day,
you walk away rich.

313
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:31,343
Don't...

314
00:19:31,517 --> 00:19:33,127
you die a few weeks earlier

315
00:19:33,302 --> 00:19:35,913
than you would've anyway,
but you leave your family

316
00:19:36,087 --> 00:19:37,828
set for life.

317
00:19:38,002 --> 00:19:40,134
I can't believe we're actually
having this conversation.

318
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:43,529
Well, after you called
my office, I researched you.

319
00:19:43,703 --> 00:19:47,664
Local boy made good,
turning the city around.

320
00:19:47,838 --> 00:19:50,928
Track star at Michigan,
solid citizen. Dodge,

321
00:19:51,102 --> 00:19:55,454
if I could wave a wand making
you well, believe me, I would.

322
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:58,631
But that wand doesn't exist,
and if it did,

323
00:19:58,805 --> 00:20:00,285
you couldn't afford it.

324
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:04,202
Is this how you find
participants?

325
00:20:04,376 --> 00:20:07,379
Lying to hospitals, telling them
you can help their patients?

326
00:20:07,553 --> 00:20:10,556
I can help you,
and that thrills me.

327
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,428
Might come as a surprise,

328
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:15,126
but I didn't grow up thinking
this would be my calling.

329
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,998
I wanted to play goalie
for the Red Wings.

330
00:20:20,392 --> 00:20:23,134
Look, usually I'm dealing
with trust fund babies

331
00:20:23,308 --> 00:20:27,356
blowing inheritances,
or degenerate gamblers.

332
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,401
I got a guy with
a six-figure coke habit

333
00:20:29,575 --> 00:20:32,361
on my call sheet right now.

334
00:20:32,535 --> 00:20:33,971
Dodge,

335
00:20:34,145 --> 00:20:37,757
you're the first
terminal person we've found

336
00:20:37,931 --> 00:20:40,630
who's actually fit enough
to be a runner.

337
00:20:42,022 --> 00:20:45,678
You're just a good man
who caught a bad hand.

338
00:20:45,852 --> 00:20:49,595
Well, if I'm a good man,
what's that make you?

339
00:20:49,769 --> 00:20:52,642
Your only hope.

340
00:20:55,906 --> 00:20:59,736
If you want to consider this,
there are rules,

341
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:03,261
most important of which is:
once you commit, that's it.

342
00:21:03,435 --> 00:21:05,437
No time-outs, no do-overs.

343
00:21:05,611 --> 00:21:07,047
My clients want to make
absolutely sure

344
00:21:07,221 --> 00:21:09,398
you know exactly
what you're getting into.

345
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:10,921
They want a fair hunt.

346
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:12,923
Mm. What gentlemen.

347
00:21:13,097 --> 00:21:14,838
Oh, don't assume they're men.

348
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:18,668
Hunters can be men, women,
Black, white, butcher, baker,

349
00:21:18,842 --> 00:21:21,714
candlestick maker--
anyone you run into

350
00:21:21,888 --> 00:21:23,890
could be the last person
you ever see.

351
00:21:24,064 --> 00:21:28,678
Next rule: the game takes place
in Detroit only.

352
00:21:28,852 --> 00:21:30,419
If you leave
the city's confines,

353
00:21:30,593 --> 00:21:33,900
that's a violation,
and then the game never ends.

354
00:21:34,074 --> 00:21:35,859
It continues
until you're killed.

355
00:21:36,033 --> 00:21:39,210
Go to the cops or get yourself
arrested, that's a violation.

356
00:21:39,384 --> 00:21:42,518
You tell anyone what's going on,
that's a violation.

357
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:44,476
It's just you
and the five hunters

358
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,217
we've lined up for this run.

359
00:21:46,391 --> 00:21:50,003
No I.D., no cash, no help;
just you on your own.

360
00:21:50,177 --> 00:21:53,050
And the money part?

361
00:21:53,224 --> 00:21:55,269
Good, that means
you're intrigued.

362
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:57,315
Top of the first hour,

363
00:21:57,489 --> 00:21:59,361
$50,000 is wired

364
00:21:59,535 --> 00:22:02,233
into your bank from an
untraceable offshore account.

365
00:22:02,407 --> 00:22:04,496
Next hour, $100,000.

366
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:09,327
Deposits increase 50 grand
every hour until hour 20,

367
00:22:09,501 --> 00:22:11,416
which pays a million,

368
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,767
and that increases by a million
every hour after that,

369
00:22:14,941 --> 00:22:16,639
culminating in the final hour,

370
00:22:16,813 --> 00:22:18,510
which pays $5 million

371
00:22:18,684 --> 00:22:22,122
-for a grand total of...
-$24.5 million.

372
00:22:22,296 --> 00:22:24,690
Yes, exactly why
you'll be great at this game.

373
00:22:24,864 --> 00:22:28,215
Smart, athletic, you know the
terrain better than the hunters.

374
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:32,306
You can pull this off.

375
00:22:32,481 --> 00:22:34,221
A few more things
you need to know:

376
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:35,788
no guns.

377
00:22:35,962 --> 00:22:38,312
Hunters need to get
up close and personal.

378
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:41,751
They're gonna get
real creative with this.

379
00:22:41,925 --> 00:22:45,015
You have to carry this
at all times.

380
00:22:45,189 --> 00:22:47,234
It can only call me.

381
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:49,106
Every time you make it
through another hour--

382
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,631
so right after your money's
deposited-- it chimes twice,

383
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:55,286
giving up your exact location

384
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,593
for the next 15 seconds.

385
00:22:57,767 --> 00:22:59,943
After that, you go dark again.

386
00:23:00,117 --> 00:23:02,554
Don't think you can drop it
on a bus and take off.

387
00:23:02,728 --> 00:23:04,948
We find the cell and not you?
That's a violation.

388
00:23:05,122 --> 00:23:07,080
It'll make you a permanent
player in the game.

389
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:11,737
Enough so you know I'm for real,

390
00:23:11,911 --> 00:23:14,131
not enough to make a dent
in your problems.

391
00:23:16,742 --> 00:23:18,527
Suit yourself.

392
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:23,488
But if you change your mind...

393
00:23:23,662 --> 00:23:26,448
here's my personal number.

394
00:23:32,715 --> 00:23:35,326
Hopefully, I'll see you soon.

395
00:23:40,244 --> 00:23:43,682
I'll see you in hell first.

396
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:45,379
No.

397
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:48,992
You'll get to go to Heaven,
Dodge, when you die.

398
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:04,050
So, even utilizing
a vacancy rate of 2.6%,

399
00:24:04,224 --> 00:24:06,531
we're still looking at returns
well above the mean.

400
00:24:06,705 --> 00:24:09,708
This variable-cost model
allows for a return of capital

401
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:12,755
greater than comparable
investments in Columbus,

402
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:15,322
Grand Rapids, Peoria
and St. Louis.

403
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:17,150
Okay, Dodge.

404
00:24:17,324 --> 00:24:19,326
-Yes, sir, you have a question?
-No, no, I think I have

405
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:20,589
a pretty good picture
of what we're looking at here.

406
00:24:20,763 --> 00:24:22,112
But I do have to say,

407
00:24:22,286 --> 00:24:24,723
my friend,
you could sell salt to a slug.

408
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:27,944
-Thank you.

409
00:24:28,118 --> 00:24:30,990
But I'm sorry to say,
you can't sell this one to me.

410
00:24:31,164 --> 00:24:32,862
I really wanted the numbers
to work, but they don't.

411
00:24:33,036 --> 00:24:35,952
But maybe we could do something
in the future, okay?

412
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,650
Maybe I could rework the offer?

413
00:24:38,824 --> 00:24:40,173
Oh, no, there's no need,

414
00:24:40,347 --> 00:24:42,915
but thank you.
It's-it's a definite pass.

415
00:24:45,222 --> 00:24:46,440
All right, my friend.

416
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:48,268
What if I give you 75% equity?

417
00:24:48,442 --> 00:24:49,922
You could give me
the whole damn building,

418
00:24:50,096 --> 00:24:51,489
wouldn't make a difference.

419
00:24:51,663 --> 00:24:54,405
I don't want the debt
that goes along with it.

420
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:57,495
Look, bring me
your next project, okay?

421
00:24:57,669 --> 00:25:01,325
There is no next project, sir.
I need this to work.

422
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:04,154
My-my family and I are going
through something right now,

423
00:25:04,328 --> 00:25:08,245
and this...
this building is all I got.

424
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:10,726
Well, I went through something
similar when I started out,

425
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,250
but trust me,
it's never as bad as it seems.

426
00:25:13,424 --> 00:25:15,426
You're gonna bounce back, kid.

427
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,036
All right, be in touch.

428
00:25:24,217 --> 00:25:25,871
You know what I don't like
about this?

429
00:25:26,045 --> 00:25:28,221
The dying part?

430
00:25:28,395 --> 00:25:29,875
What I don't like is what
a little bitch you're being.

431
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:32,225
When you tore up
your ankle at regionals,

432
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:34,576
you trained your ass off,
came back, and won state.

433
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,229
And when that prick

434
00:25:36,403 --> 00:25:38,362
associate professor
tried to steal Val-- Hey.

435
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:41,104
Look at me when
I'm talking to you.

436
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:42,584
When that prick tried to steal

437
00:25:42,758 --> 00:25:45,543
Val away,
you knocked him in the dirt.

438
00:25:45,717 --> 00:25:48,154
You're a lousy singer,
an average card player,

439
00:25:48,328 --> 00:25:50,461
and the best friend I got,
so you fight,

440
00:25:50,635 --> 00:25:52,071
like you always do.

441
00:25:52,245 --> 00:25:55,771
I got no money, no insurance.

442
00:25:55,945 --> 00:25:59,949
My parents are dead.
Val's family's broke.

443
00:26:00,123 --> 00:26:02,125
What exactly do I fight with?

444
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:05,563
You got a son on the way, so you
fight with everything you got.

445
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:17,531
Hey.

446
00:26:18,924 --> 00:26:20,360
Where'd you go?

447
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:23,537
I took a walk to clear my head.

448
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,499
Uh...

449
00:26:28,673 --> 00:26:31,154
I have something to tell you.

450
00:26:31,328 --> 00:26:33,983
An offer was made to me.

451
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:38,857
Jerry Pierce
wants to close financing.

452
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:40,598
So we're gonna have money
coming in,

453
00:26:40,772 --> 00:26:42,513
and we're gonna use it
for the most aggressive drugs

454
00:26:42,687 --> 00:26:45,298
out there, experimental
surgeries, whatever it takes.

455
00:26:45,472 --> 00:26:47,997
I did some research and there's
doctors that have developed

456
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:50,129
-procedures that they...
-Oh, my God.

457
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:58,094
Listen,

458
00:26:58,268 --> 00:27:01,445
I'm not ready to let go yet,

459
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:03,360
so I'm gonna fight.

460
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:06,363
I'm gonna fight for all three of
us, and I'm not gonna give up.

461
00:27:09,409 --> 00:27:11,237
Are we gonna be okay?

462
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:16,329
Yeah.

463
00:27:16,503 --> 00:27:18,723
Yeah, I promise.

464
00:28:01,897 --> 00:28:04,595
MILES
Hello, Dodge.

465
00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:06,510
How'd you know it was me?

466
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:08,120
You're the only person

467
00:28:08,294 --> 00:28:09,905
outside my team
who has this number.

468
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:12,081
How can I help you?

469
00:28:17,564 --> 00:28:21,003
I'm in.

470
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:40,457
I love you.

471
00:28:54,427 --> 00:28:56,038
Where you going?

472
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:01,521
I'm just going for a run.

473
00:29:01,695 --> 00:29:03,567
Go back to sleep, okay?

474
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,862
Cutting it close.

475
00:29:38,036 --> 00:29:39,603
Game's from sunrise to sunrise.

476
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:42,867
Daybreak's at46.

477
00:29:43,041 --> 00:29:46,828
-Here. I ordered those for you.
-I'm not hungry.

478
00:29:47,002 --> 00:29:48,394
No, you should eat.

479
00:29:48,568 --> 00:29:51,049
-You need fuel in your tank.
-I'm fine.

480
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:52,659
Oh, suit yourself, but it's

481
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:54,009
tough going out there
when you're on the run.

482
00:29:54,183 --> 00:29:55,706
I run every day.

483
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,578
Not like this you don't.

484
00:30:00,145 --> 00:30:01,581
Empty your pockets.

485
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:04,323
Is there a problem?

486
00:30:04,497 --> 00:30:06,935
I'm just thinking
maybe I should go home.

487
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:09,981
To what?

488
00:30:10,155 --> 00:30:12,375
A wife who can
watch you die penniless?

489
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:15,508
A family that'll be homeless
in a matter of months?

490
00:30:15,682 --> 00:30:17,771
Dodge, we both know
you're too good a man

491
00:30:17,946 --> 00:30:20,296
to leave them like that
just because you're scared.

492
00:30:28,086 --> 00:30:29,609
Wait, hold on.

493
00:30:31,611 --> 00:30:33,526
The ultrasound.

494
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,225
Oh, fair enough.

495
00:30:38,749 --> 00:30:40,403
Keep those.

496
00:30:40,577 --> 00:30:42,709
If you're debilitated,
you can't provide a good game.

497
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:43,928
Get up.

498
00:30:44,102 --> 00:30:45,625
What?

499
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:47,018
Come on, on your feet.

500
00:30:47,192 --> 00:30:49,455
It'll only take a second.

501
00:30:49,629 --> 00:30:51,370
Arms out.

502
00:30:51,544 --> 00:30:54,243
I got to pat you down.
My apologies,

503
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:56,332
-but it's a requirement.
-People are watching.

504
00:30:56,506 --> 00:30:57,768
Yeah, they think
you're on parole

505
00:30:57,942 --> 00:30:59,291
and I'm your probation officer.

506
00:30:59,465 --> 00:31:00,684
Great.

507
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:04,818
I had a guy in San Juan

508
00:31:04,993 --> 00:31:07,212
smuggle a knife in his sock.

509
00:31:07,386 --> 00:31:09,867
In the end it did him no good,
but my clients were

510
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:11,782
rightfully upset that the game
was compromised.

511
00:31:11,956 --> 00:31:14,437
How many people have you roped
into this shit?

512
00:31:14,611 --> 00:31:16,787
Considering the stakes,

513
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:19,485
-more than you'd imagine.

514
00:31:19,659 --> 00:31:22,836
Considering the state of the
world, fewer than you'd expect.

515
00:31:24,534 --> 00:31:26,318
Yeah, it's me. Yeah.

516
00:31:26,492 --> 00:31:29,626
Wire $50,000 into the
player's account, please.

517
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,019
I-I'll wait.

518
00:31:32,716 --> 00:31:34,631
Do you guys have a name
for the baby?

519
00:31:36,676 --> 00:31:40,028
Yeah? Thanks.

520
00:31:43,248 --> 00:31:46,121
Open the dollar sign app.

521
00:31:51,474 --> 00:31:52,605
This is my bank account.
How...

522
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:54,912
Look at the balance.

523
00:31:56,305 --> 00:31:59,395
For the first hour, whether you
live through it or not.

524
00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:02,180
Now you know the setup works.

525
00:32:15,454 --> 00:32:18,109
"I'll love you both forever."

526
00:32:28,815 --> 00:32:30,861
Don't look at the clock,
look at me.

527
00:32:31,035 --> 00:32:32,689
I want you to get through this.

528
00:32:32,863 --> 00:32:35,431
I want you to have a shot
at holding that kid of yours,

529
00:32:35,605 --> 00:32:38,434
or at least leave him something,
so listen to me carefully.

530
00:32:38,608 --> 00:32:40,523
What you want to do
is keep moving.

531
00:32:40,697 --> 00:32:42,568
Crowds are your friend.

532
00:32:42,742 --> 00:32:44,266
Hunters don't want
to kill you too publicly,

533
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,224
or they wind up spending
the rest of their lives

534
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:48,922
in prison under the fake
identities we set up for them.

535
00:32:49,097 --> 00:32:53,014
Trust no one, keep your head
on a swivel, stay paranoid.

536
00:32:53,188 --> 00:32:56,060
-Got it?
-Yeah. Yeah, okay.

537
00:32:56,234 --> 00:32:59,237
Yeah. When do you
tell the hunters?

538
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:01,413
Well, they're in here
with us now, all five of them.

539
00:33:01,587 --> 00:33:03,372
What?

540
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,723
Yeah, that's right,
it could be anyone.

541
00:33:09,508 --> 00:33:11,423
Dodge, Dodge.

542
00:33:11,597 --> 00:33:13,686
Adrenaline
is flushing your system,

543
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,819
your heart rate's going like
you're making the final turn

544
00:33:15,993 --> 00:33:18,474
in the quarter mile-- you got to
get this shit in check,

545
00:33:18,648 --> 00:33:19,997
or you won't make it past noon.

546
00:33:20,171 --> 00:33:22,173
Yeah.

547
00:33:24,175 --> 00:33:25,307
When does it start?

548
00:33:29,528 --> 00:33:30,747
It just did.

549
00:33:30,921 --> 00:33:32,879
You get a three-minute
head start.

550
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:35,752
You can use it to take in as
many faces as you can, but for

551
00:33:35,926 --> 00:33:38,276
all you know, the hunters have
already slipped out the back.

552
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,799
Or you can run your ass off.

553
00:33:39,973 --> 00:33:41,279
There are three Fs, kid:

554
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:43,934
fight, flight or freeze.

555
00:33:45,762 --> 00:33:47,285
The third one gets you killed.

556
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:59,254
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
-I'm sorry.

557
00:34:25,193 --> 00:34:27,673
Fare? $1.50.

558
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,024
Shit. I lost my wallet.

559
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,461
Step off the bus, sir.

560
00:34:32,635 --> 00:34:33,505
Come on, man,
you've seen me before.

561
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,028
You know I have a monthly.

562
00:34:36,247 --> 00:34:37,640
Just this one time.

563
00:34:37,814 --> 00:34:39,511
Thanks.

564
00:35:04,145 --> 00:35:05,494
Hold the bus!

565
00:35:07,148 --> 00:35:08,105
Hey, let's go!

566
00:35:08,279 --> 00:35:09,802
Come on, man, this thing runs

567
00:35:09,976 --> 00:35:11,674
-on a schedule. Let's move it.
-Don't you tell me

568
00:35:11,848 --> 00:35:13,197
how to drive my damn bus.

569
00:35:15,068 --> 00:35:17,070
Thanks, man.

570
00:35:28,734 --> 00:35:30,649
Mind moving over?

571
00:36:02,986 --> 00:36:04,814
Stop the bus!

572
00:36:04,988 --> 00:36:06,337
Stop the bus.

573
00:36:06,511 --> 00:36:08,948
I need to get off.
Stop the bus.

574
00:36:09,122 --> 00:36:10,994
You need to stay
behind the yellow line, sir.

575
00:36:11,168 --> 00:36:12,648
Stop the fucking bus!

576
00:36:12,822 --> 00:36:16,608
-Get your crazy ass off my bus.

577
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:52,427
Let's see what
you bloodsuckers want.

578
00:36:54,124 --> 00:36:56,474
Deposit?

579
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,302
Hmm.

580
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,097
Oh, my God.

581
00:37:14,536 --> 00:37:17,452
Oh. I'm sorry, your husband

582
00:37:17,626 --> 00:37:19,889
can't come to the phone
right now.

583
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:27,636
He's busy playing a game.

584
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,377
DODGE
You've reached Dodge Tynes
of Tynes Construction.

585
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:31,335
Leave a message,
and I'll get right back to you.

586
00:37:31,509 --> 00:37:33,032
Hi, hon.

587
00:37:33,206 --> 00:37:34,817
I know you said we'd have
some money coming in,

588
00:37:34,991 --> 00:37:38,734
but we just had 50 grand
deposited into our account.

589
00:37:38,908 --> 00:37:42,303
Kind of crazy Jerry Pierce
would get to us so soon.

590
00:37:42,477 --> 00:37:45,349
Call me back. Love you.

591
00:37:54,924 --> 00:37:57,840
Oh. Yeah, Connell?

592
00:37:58,014 --> 00:38:00,712
Your boy isn't doing well.
He's panicking.

593
00:38:00,886 --> 00:38:02,671
Are you questioning
my selection?

594
00:38:02,845 --> 00:38:04,150
I am not.

595
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:06,283
Good. Dodge is an athlete.

596
00:38:06,457 --> 00:38:08,154
He'll give a good hunt.

597
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:11,114
I'm certain you're correct;
however, you should be aware

598
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:14,335
Carter is right on Tynes' trail.

599
00:38:19,427 --> 00:38:21,254
He's hardly 50 yards behind him.

600
00:38:21,429 --> 00:38:24,040
Come on, Dodge,
don't make me look bad.

601
00:39:20,575 --> 00:39:22,664
Crowds are your friend.

602
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:09,624
What the hell am I supposed
to do with these?

603
00:40:09,798 --> 00:40:12,235
Just let me sit here a minute.

604
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:15,238
Get out of my chair
before I kick your ass.

605
00:40:19,503 --> 00:40:20,939
Hey, hey!

606
00:40:21,113 --> 00:40:22,245
Newspaper's a dollar!

607
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:23,464
Hold the door!

608
00:40:24,508 --> 00:40:25,988
Thanks.

609
00:41:35,797 --> 00:41:37,581
Okay, just breathe.

610
00:41:37,755 --> 00:41:39,104
Regulate your heart rate.

611
00:41:39,278 --> 00:41:40,889
Stay hydrated.

612
00:41:41,063 --> 00:41:43,500
You're okay, you're okay.

613
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:47,553
So...

614
00:44:47,728 --> 00:44:49,251
Mr. Tynes?

615
00:44:52,689 --> 00:44:53,777
Shall we?

616
00:44:56,171 --> 00:44:59,696
I was told that you were
a competitor, Mr. Tynes.

617
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:03,656
A fighter.

618
00:45:05,746 --> 00:45:07,748
Someone with something
to live for.

619
00:45:10,098 --> 00:45:11,969
But sadly...

620
00:45:12,143 --> 00:45:14,189
it appears that
you're nothing more...

621
00:45:14,363 --> 00:45:16,321
than a waste of my time...

622
00:45:16,495 --> 00:45:18,236
my energy...

623
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:20,412
and my resources.

624
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:29,334
I have to say...

625
00:45:29,508 --> 00:45:31,510
that I'm disappointed.

626
00:45:39,475 --> 00:45:41,172
-Nixon.
-Mr. Sellars,

627
00:45:41,346 --> 00:45:43,305
I traveled a quarter of the way
around the globe

628
00:45:43,479 --> 00:45:45,655
for a hunt
that's lasted less than an hour.

629
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:47,352
This is Johannesburg
all over again.

630
00:45:47,526 --> 00:45:49,528
We'll need to discuss
your refund policy.

631
00:45:49,702 --> 00:45:51,139
I apologize.

632
00:45:51,313 --> 00:45:54,272
I-It's not the quality
of product you deserve,

633
00:45:54,446 --> 00:45:56,622
nor is it what The Tiro Fund
strives to provide.

634
00:45:56,797 --> 00:45:58,537
I'll make it right
on the next hunt.

635
00:45:58,711 --> 00:45:59,843
You have my word.

636
00:46:00,017 --> 00:46:02,280
Sorry, Dodge.

637
00:46:08,591 --> 00:46:10,114
Okay. Now we...

638
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:21,125
Sir?

639
00:46:21,299 --> 00:46:23,171
Tynes has exited the bathroom.

640
00:46:23,345 --> 00:46:24,737
In a body bag.

641
00:46:24,912 --> 00:46:26,391
Not at this speed, he's not.

642
00:46:26,565 --> 00:46:28,829
He's alive.

643
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:36,793
Attaboy, Dodge.

644
00:46:44,888 --> 00:46:47,673
You've reached the Tynes.
Please leave a message.

645
00:46:49,675 --> 00:46:51,155
Dodge, it's Jerry Pierce.

646
00:46:51,329 --> 00:46:52,722
Um, I couldn't get you
on the cell,

647
00:46:52,896 --> 00:46:54,550
so I figured I'd try you
at home, and--

648
00:46:54,724 --> 00:46:56,378
Look, I feel bad about
saying no to The Carrington,

649
00:46:56,552 --> 00:46:57,988
but I had a thought.

650
00:46:58,162 --> 00:47:00,164
How about you project manage
for me?

651
00:47:00,338 --> 00:47:02,558
Now, I know it's not the same
as running your own company,

652
00:47:02,732 --> 00:47:05,866
but I would love to have
a guy like you on my team.

653
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,912
So, please, give me a call.

654
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,669
What the hell?

655
00:47:40,074 --> 00:47:41,336
Shit.

656
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:43,338
14 wolverine, 13 wolverine...

657
00:47:43,512 --> 00:47:46,036
Okay, gang, today we're
gonna be doing a half mile

658
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:48,604
-down to the post office
and back to the bakery.
-11 wolverine, ten wolverine,

659
00:47:48,778 --> 00:47:52,042
nine wolverine, eight wolverine,

660
00:47:52,216 --> 00:47:54,218
-seven wolverine...
-Dodge,

661
00:47:54,392 --> 00:47:56,264
there's 150 grand
in our bank account.

662
00:47:56,438 --> 00:47:57,700
...five wolverine...

663
00:47:57,874 --> 00:47:59,136
I know Jerry Pierce

664
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:00,616
didn't come in on our building.

665
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:03,184
Where are you? Call me.

666
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:04,185
...one wolverine.

667
00:48:04,359 --> 00:48:06,100
What is he saying?

668
00:48:06,274 --> 00:48:08,450
Hey, son, are you all right?

669
00:48:08,624 --> 00:48:09,755
No.

670
00:48:18,721 --> 00:48:22,246
Now, you squirm

671
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,509
or holler,

672
00:48:24,683 --> 00:48:28,296
some of these good folks
might get hurt, too.

673
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:31,473
And they didn't agree
to partake in no hunt.

674
00:48:33,692 --> 00:48:35,694
Let's go for a little walk.

675
00:48:46,227 --> 00:48:47,141
Looger, it's Val.

676
00:48:47,315 --> 00:48:48,359
Are you with Dodge?

677
00:48:48,533 --> 00:48:50,231
Okay, listen,

678
00:48:50,405 --> 00:48:53,277
we just had $150,000
sent to us this morning.

679
00:48:53,451 --> 00:48:55,062
Dodge said it was from this deal
that I just learned

680
00:48:55,236 --> 00:48:57,064
doesn't exist, and now
I can't get in touch with him.

681
00:48:57,238 --> 00:48:59,718
No, Looger, I'm telling you,
something is wrong.

682
00:48:59,892 --> 00:49:01,024
I think he's in trouble.

683
00:49:01,198 --> 00:49:03,722
There you go.
Nice and easy...

684
00:49:03,896 --> 00:49:05,594
to the escalator over there.

685
00:49:05,768 --> 00:49:08,292
We're gonna ride on up
to the mezzanine,

686
00:49:08,466 --> 00:49:11,948
then out to the loading docks.

687
00:49:12,122 --> 00:49:13,950
How that sound?

688
00:49:14,124 --> 00:49:16,257
Come on, now.

689
00:49:20,913 --> 00:49:23,003
Reagan.

690
00:49:38,279 --> 00:49:40,716
Limey son of a bitch.

691
00:49:51,422 --> 00:49:52,684
Impressive.

692
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:14,489
It seems Mr. Tynes
escaped Nixon and Reagan

693
00:50:14,663 --> 00:50:16,621
just a few minutes apart.

694
00:50:16,795 --> 00:50:18,362
I told you
he'd give a good hunt.

695
00:50:18,536 --> 00:50:19,624
You did, sir.

696
00:50:19,798 --> 00:50:20,799
Well,

697
00:50:20,973 --> 00:50:23,367
I'm off to follow our players.

698
00:50:32,507 --> 00:50:33,290
-Watch it!

699
00:50:48,305 --> 00:50:49,654
Fuck.

700
00:50:57,314 --> 00:50:59,403
Everything okay down there?

701
00:50:59,577 --> 00:51:02,189
Saw you fall
from across the street.

702
00:51:02,363 --> 00:51:03,929
Yes.

703
00:51:04,104 --> 00:51:06,236
Uh, he's fine.
Thank you, Officer.

704
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:09,109
Not talking to you. Talking
to the guy with the bloody beak.

705
00:51:17,247 --> 00:51:18,814
Yeah, I'm okay, sir.

706
00:51:18,988 --> 00:51:21,077
Maybe don't run
like a maniac next time.

707
00:51:21,251 --> 00:51:23,601
Yeah, you must forgive
my friend, Officer.

708
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:27,779
He's, uh... he's late
for his wife's ultrasound.

709
00:51:27,953 --> 00:51:30,042
Today...

710
00:51:30,217 --> 00:51:33,089
is the day
they find out the gender.

711
00:51:33,263 --> 00:51:36,092
It really is a very exciting
day, isn't it, mate?

712
00:51:38,355 --> 00:51:39,400
Yeah.

713
00:51:39,574 --> 00:51:40,401
All right.

714
00:51:40,575 --> 00:51:41,445
Congrats on the kid.

715
00:51:41,619 --> 00:51:42,533
Get that nose checked out.

716
00:51:42,707 --> 00:51:44,231
Okay.

717
00:52:02,292 --> 00:52:03,946
Hey!

718
00:52:23,313 --> 00:52:25,489
That tea-sipping nancy boy
ain't here to save you now,

719
00:52:25,663 --> 00:52:26,534
is he, son?

720
00:53:03,223 --> 00:53:05,747
Next stop, Fort/Cass Station.

721
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:27,551
Fuckin' Detroit, right?

722
00:53:43,001 --> 00:53:44,655
Look here, Benny Hill.

723
00:53:44,829 --> 00:53:46,266
I was actively engaged
back there.

724
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,050
You interfered with my kill.

725
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:50,357
Violated the rules of the hunt.

726
00:53:50,531 --> 00:53:53,185
First, I know the rules
of the hunt better than anyone.

727
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:56,101
You had merely trapped the prey
in a public setting,

728
00:53:56,276 --> 00:53:58,843
which negates any possibility
of active engagement.

729
00:53:59,017 --> 00:54:02,282
Now, if I come upon you
and the prey on the loading dock

730
00:54:02,456 --> 00:54:04,109
behind the building,
which was private and secure,

731
00:54:04,284 --> 00:54:06,460
then, yes, you would have been
in active engagement

732
00:54:06,634 --> 00:54:09,071
and any interference on my part
would have been a violation.

733
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:10,986
But that was not the case.

734
00:54:12,335 --> 00:54:14,381
And, second,

735
00:54:14,555 --> 00:54:17,253
you will remove your hands
from my suit immediately,

736
00:54:17,427 --> 00:54:19,211
or I will remove
your left testicle

737
00:54:19,386 --> 00:54:20,996
from the inside of your body.

738
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:32,007
Whatever you say, Mr. Belvedere.

739
00:54:39,231 --> 00:54:41,930
The kid left Reagan and Nixon
holding their jocks,

740
00:54:42,104 --> 00:54:43,540
twice.

741
00:54:43,714 --> 00:54:45,455
Our other hunters?

742
00:54:45,629 --> 00:54:47,892
All in the vicinity.

743
00:54:48,066 --> 00:54:50,286
Dodge may feel safe
on that train,

744
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,157
but that's not gonna last.

745
00:55:45,123 --> 00:55:46,386
Shit!

746
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,867
Sorry if I startled you.

747
00:55:50,041 --> 00:55:51,913
Father...

748
00:55:52,087 --> 00:55:53,697
Sorry, yeah,
you kind of scared me.

749
00:55:53,871 --> 00:55:56,657
Not my intention.

750
00:55:56,831 --> 00:55:59,486
Are you here for confession?

751
00:56:03,881 --> 00:56:05,883
Sure.

752
00:56:11,019 --> 00:56:14,675
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

753
00:56:14,849 --> 00:56:17,721
It's been a while
since my last confession.

754
00:56:23,727 --> 00:56:27,470
If I'm being honest, Father...

755
00:56:27,644 --> 00:56:29,603
I'm afraid that
I've willingly engaged

756
00:56:29,777 --> 00:56:32,083
in something that is...

757
00:56:32,257 --> 00:56:34,042
inherently evil.

758
00:56:36,392 --> 00:56:38,960
And now I can't get out of it.

759
00:56:41,223 --> 00:56:43,660
Let's see.

760
00:56:43,834 --> 00:56:45,967
Well, it's got
a foreign account code.

761
00:56:46,141 --> 00:56:48,317
But they don't give the source.

762
00:56:48,491 --> 00:56:51,015
And with international
banking laws and all...

763
00:56:51,189 --> 00:56:53,844
I'm sorry, do you not know
how you got this money?

764
00:56:54,018 --> 00:56:55,890
-No, that's...
-Uh, it's her uncle's estate.

765
00:56:56,064 --> 00:56:58,109
He was very wealthy;
holdings all over the place.

766
00:56:58,283 --> 00:57:00,198
So we're just
trying to figure out

767
00:57:00,372 --> 00:57:02,549
where exactly
the money's coming from.

768
00:57:02,723 --> 00:57:04,681
You know, we don't want her
cousins finding out about a new

769
00:57:04,855 --> 00:57:07,292
account, and then making claims
on assets they don't deserve.

770
00:57:07,467 --> 00:57:09,556
Yeah. Uh...
they weren't the ones

771
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,862
changing the old man's diapers
the past two years.

772
00:57:13,864 --> 00:57:16,345
I'm gonna get my manager
to take a look at this.

773
00:57:16,519 --> 00:57:18,478
It's strange, the deposits
seem to be coming

774
00:57:18,652 --> 00:57:22,830
in regular intervals--
46 minutes after every hour.

775
00:57:23,004 --> 00:57:24,135
50,000...

776
00:57:24,309 --> 00:57:26,094
100,000...

777
00:57:26,268 --> 00:57:27,312
150,000...

778
00:57:27,487 --> 00:57:28,749
150?

779
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,709
Yes, at46 this morning.

780
00:57:32,883 --> 00:57:34,668
Are you not aware
of this last deposit?

781
00:57:36,583 --> 00:57:38,323
We just... had no idea

782
00:57:38,498 --> 00:57:40,282
how much Uncle Jimmy
actually had.

783
00:57:40,456 --> 00:57:43,241
Well...
I'm gonna get my manager.

784
00:57:43,415 --> 00:57:45,505
It's okay. Uh, everything
seems to be in order.

785
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:47,028
Thank you for your time.

786
00:57:50,814 --> 00:57:51,989
What are you doing?

787
00:57:52,163 --> 00:57:53,469
300 grand?

788
00:57:53,643 --> 00:57:55,036
Dodge is into some
serious shit, okay?

789
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:56,559
And the last thing we need

790
00:57:56,733 --> 00:57:58,126
is someone looking
into it before we can

791
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:00,258
figure out what's going on.

792
00:58:04,741 --> 00:58:07,483
Thought I had no choice.

793
00:58:07,657 --> 00:58:11,008
You know, I couldn't just
leave my family with nothing.

794
00:58:11,182 --> 00:58:15,012
Wanting to provide for
your loved ones is not a sin.

795
00:58:16,579 --> 00:58:18,363
Yeah.

796
00:58:18,538 --> 00:58:20,975
Howyou decide to do it...

797
00:58:21,149 --> 00:58:22,585
-it can be.

798
00:58:22,759 --> 00:58:24,848
-What exactly are you doing?

799
00:58:25,022 --> 00:58:26,894
Dealing drugs, stealing?

800
00:58:27,068 --> 00:58:29,026
No, no.

801
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,552
I'd never do something
that could hurt someone else.

802
00:58:35,032 --> 00:58:37,818
Ironically, the only person
that could get hurt is me.

803
00:58:46,914 --> 00:58:49,046
Okay, well, call me
if you have any information.

804
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:50,657
Thanks.

805
00:58:50,831 --> 00:58:52,310
Anything?

806
00:58:52,484 --> 00:58:53,921
Hospitals
and morgues have no one

807
00:58:54,095 --> 00:58:55,705
fitting his description,
so I guess that's good.

808
00:59:00,275 --> 00:59:02,103
You called the police?

809
00:59:02,277 --> 00:59:04,148
We don't know
what Dodge is doing.

810
00:59:04,322 --> 00:59:05,759
I thought we agreed we were
gonna keep him out of trouble.

811
00:59:05,933 --> 00:59:07,021
He's already in trouble.

812
00:59:09,414 --> 00:59:13,244
My son, I cannot provide you
with the sacrament of penance

813
00:59:13,418 --> 00:59:15,159
unless you confess
your specific misdeed

814
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:17,945
and express your heartfelt
sorrow for having committed it.

815
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:20,382
Thing is...

816
00:59:20,556 --> 00:59:23,603
the rules say
I can't tell anyone.

817
00:59:23,777 --> 00:59:25,561
If I tell you,
and you go to the cops...

818
00:59:25,735 --> 00:59:26,997
I'm forbidden from breaching

819
00:59:27,171 --> 00:59:29,086
the confidentiality
of confession.

820
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:33,003
Church canon dictates that
I cannot betray your trust.

821
00:59:35,049 --> 00:59:38,139
Father, if I told you...

822
00:59:38,313 --> 00:59:40,576
you wouldn't believe me.

823
00:59:49,063 --> 00:59:50,978
Hey! Hey!
Hey, hey!

824
00:59:51,152 --> 00:59:52,240
Stop that this instant!

825
00:59:52,414 --> 00:59:54,808
He's trying to kill me!

826
00:59:54,982 --> 00:59:57,985
I was, I was just
waiting my turn! Fuck.

827
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:00,335
You just violated
the sanctity of my church.

828
01:00:00,509 --> 01:00:02,163
Now, sit down
and tell me exactly why

829
01:00:02,337 --> 01:00:04,774
you think people
are trying to kill you.

830
01:00:06,994 --> 01:00:10,214
Because I agreed to it.

831
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:15,219
Does your husband have a history
of depression in his family?

832
01:00:15,393 --> 01:00:16,307
No.

833
01:00:16,481 --> 01:00:18,222
Suicide?

834
01:00:18,396 --> 01:00:20,485
No.

835
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:22,139
Sorry, I-I got to ask.

836
01:00:22,313 --> 01:00:23,837
Often people who are sick,

837
01:00:24,011 --> 01:00:25,534
they want to go out
on their own terms.

838
01:00:25,708 --> 01:00:27,579
It's okay.

839
01:00:27,754 --> 01:00:29,756
Sorry, I have to ask this.

840
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:33,194
Um, and for your husband's sake,
I need you to tell the truth.

841
01:00:33,368 --> 01:00:34,978
Was he involved
in anything illegal?

842
01:00:35,152 --> 01:00:37,067
Drugs, financial crimes,
anything that could

843
01:00:37,241 --> 01:00:40,375
help explain the deposits
you've been receiving?

844
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:42,333
The idea that
my husband would be involved

845
01:00:42,507 --> 01:00:44,118
in anything illegal is absurd.

846
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:46,729
Okay.

847
01:00:46,903 --> 01:00:50,037
Uh, my situation is this:

848
01:00:50,211 --> 01:00:52,474
I can't even file a missing
person's report for 24 hours,

849
01:00:52,648 --> 01:00:55,738
so my hands are tied, but, uh...

850
01:00:55,912 --> 01:00:58,175
Look, I'll poke around,
talk to some people.

851
01:00:58,349 --> 01:01:00,743
But I got to be honest,
I'm grasping right now.

852
01:01:00,917 --> 01:01:03,485
My husband is a good man.

853
01:01:03,659 --> 01:01:06,053
Please, if there's
anything you can do...

854
01:01:06,227 --> 01:01:08,620
Yeah, of course.

855
01:01:11,101 --> 01:01:12,450
I got less than a minute,
Father-- I got to go.

856
01:01:12,624 --> 01:01:14,626
Why? What's so urgent
at45 on a weekday

857
01:01:14,801 --> 01:01:16,890
that you need to run off instead
of tell me your problems?

858
01:01:17,064 --> 01:01:18,630
45 isn't when things
get urgent, Father.

859
01:01:18,805 --> 01:01:20,067
It's46-- that's when
they'll know where I am.

860
01:01:20,241 --> 01:01:21,503
Who? Who will know?

861
01:01:21,677 --> 01:01:23,331
Look... I can't say.

862
01:01:23,505 --> 01:01:24,724
Whoever it is,

863
01:01:24,898 --> 01:01:27,248
I promise I won't
let them hurt you.

864
01:01:27,422 --> 01:01:28,466
Not in my house.

865
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,730
Not in the Lord's house.

866
01:01:32,122 --> 01:01:33,602
Ah, shit, you see?

867
01:01:33,776 --> 01:01:35,473
Now they know where I am.

868
01:01:35,647 --> 01:01:37,737
Actually, Dodge,

869
01:01:37,911 --> 01:01:40,261
I've known where you are
for some time now.

870
01:01:42,916 --> 01:01:44,178
Looks like it's over.

871
01:01:44,352 --> 01:01:46,441
Carter's got him pinned.

872
01:01:46,615 --> 01:01:49,226
Three hours, one minute. Oh.

873
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,186
Still below average,
but considering he's got away

874
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,318
from Reagan and Nixon,
you can't say

875
01:01:54,492 --> 01:01:57,234
-it was not a formidable hunt.

876
01:01:57,408 --> 01:02:00,498
Connell, you're at that church?

877
01:02:00,672 --> 01:02:02,936
Have been for a while.

878
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:05,373
Yeah, get ready for a cleanup.

879
01:02:13,163 --> 01:02:14,991
The gates are wrought iron.

880
01:02:15,165 --> 01:02:16,645
There's no pulling them open!

881
01:02:21,345 --> 01:02:24,696
Now, why would I lock one gate,
but not the others?

882
01:02:24,871 --> 01:02:26,655
That would be illogical.

883
01:02:28,091 --> 01:02:31,268
Lord, I hate dumb prey.

884
01:02:31,442 --> 01:02:35,011
I have a psychology degree
from the University of Ibadan,

885
01:02:35,185 --> 01:02:38,232
master's in behavioral studies
from Oxford.

886
01:02:38,406 --> 01:02:40,843
That is how
I was able to find you.

887
01:02:41,017 --> 01:02:44,499
You see, an hour ago,

888
01:02:44,673 --> 01:02:47,894
when I got your location,
I was nowhere near you,

889
01:02:48,068 --> 01:02:51,723
but the entire 15 seconds
that you were exposed,

890
01:02:51,898 --> 01:02:53,813
you headed north.

891
01:02:53,987 --> 01:02:56,511
I saw you were a few blocks

892
01:02:56,685 --> 01:02:58,600
from St. Jerome's.

893
01:02:58,774 --> 01:03:01,211
And though I know you are

894
01:03:01,385 --> 01:03:04,998
a lapsed Catholic
from your file,

895
01:03:05,172 --> 01:03:07,739
church is still
something familiar, eh?

896
01:03:09,263 --> 01:03:11,221
When scared,

897
01:03:11,395 --> 01:03:14,485
we subconsciously run
towards the familiar.

898
01:03:14,659 --> 01:03:17,358
It soothes us.

899
01:03:21,666 --> 01:03:23,973
I knew you wouldn't
immediately go inside.

900
01:03:24,147 --> 01:03:26,671
Fear of being trapped
the way Nixon had you confined

901
01:03:26,846 --> 01:03:28,108
in the Renaissance Center, eh?

902
01:03:29,849 --> 01:03:33,896
But, eventually,
you would seek sanctuary.

903
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:38,031
I got here before you,
locked up,

904
01:03:38,205 --> 01:03:40,381
borrowed some clothes
from the rectory,

905
01:03:40,555 --> 01:03:42,731
and here we are--

906
01:03:42,905 --> 01:03:45,255
you, me...

907
01:03:45,429 --> 01:03:49,781
and my father's 20-ounce
steel shaft rip claw.

908
01:03:49,956 --> 01:03:51,827
Why didn't you just kill me
in confession?

909
01:03:52,001 --> 01:03:55,831
I wanted to see if you'd break
the rules and expose the hunt.

910
01:03:56,005 --> 01:03:58,442
I didn't say anything.
I followed the rules.

911
01:03:58,616 --> 01:04:01,010
Yes. You play with honor.

912
01:04:01,184 --> 01:04:03,578
That is why
I'm going to kill you quickly.

913
01:04:03,752 --> 01:04:05,232
Come on, man.
I have a family.

914
01:04:05,406 --> 01:04:06,711
I know that
from your profile, too.

915
01:04:18,288 --> 01:04:21,074
You put up a valiant fight.

916
01:04:21,248 --> 01:04:23,337
You should be proud.

917
01:04:23,511 --> 01:04:26,122
Goodbye, Mr. Tynes.

918
01:04:41,921 --> 01:04:43,705
This is my favorite part.

919
01:05:05,553 --> 01:05:08,295
The gates are wrought iron.
There's no pulling them open.

920
01:05:08,469 --> 01:05:11,167
If I were you,
I'd get those prayer candles

921
01:05:11,341 --> 01:05:12,995
and burn this church
to the ground,

922
01:05:13,169 --> 01:05:15,737
'cause if you leave me alive,
trust me when I say

923
01:05:15,911 --> 01:05:17,913
you will see me real soon!

924
01:05:19,523 --> 01:05:22,265
You said you read my file.
What file?

925
01:05:24,441 --> 01:05:27,923
Background on potential prey.

926
01:05:28,097 --> 01:05:32,493
As a psychologist, I find it
helpful with my tracking.

927
01:05:32,667 --> 01:05:35,365
Troglodytes like Reagan
don't ever read them.

928
01:05:35,539 --> 01:05:38,325
I'm not even sure he can read.

929
01:05:38,499 --> 01:05:39,717
Reagan?

930
01:05:39,891 --> 01:05:41,197
You said Nixon earlier.

931
01:05:41,371 --> 01:05:42,982
And I'm Carter.

932
01:05:43,156 --> 01:05:46,115
Miles gives us pseudonyms
to protect the hunt.

933
01:05:46,289 --> 01:05:48,900
I like the name "Carter"
because of his work

934
01:05:49,075 --> 01:05:51,816
with Habitat for Humanity.

935
01:05:51,991 --> 01:05:55,211
They use tools... just like me.

936
01:06:01,783 --> 01:06:03,567
You asked for this, Mr. Tynes!

937
01:06:03,741 --> 01:06:05,134
You said so yourself!

938
01:06:05,308 --> 01:06:06,353
-Oh, fuck.

939
01:06:06,527 --> 01:06:07,963
Hey, hey, my brother.

940
01:06:08,137 --> 01:06:10,574
I-I'm sorry, but I believe
that is my hammer.

941
01:06:10,748 --> 01:06:13,012
Huh?

942
01:06:21,803 --> 01:06:26,025
Hey! Stealing from the church?

943
01:06:26,199 --> 01:06:29,941
Oh, you know that is bad juju,
man! Bad juju!

944
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:33,554
I'm coming for you.

945
01:06:33,728 --> 01:06:36,339
Mr. Tynes!

946
01:06:36,513 --> 01:06:38,863
I am coming for you.

947
01:07:10,895 --> 01:07:13,985
How the hell did he get out
of the church,

948
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,726
and Carter isn't moving?

949
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:21,689
Connell?

950
01:07:21,863 --> 01:07:23,560
Did he kill Carter?

951
01:07:23,734 --> 01:07:25,954
No, he...

952
01:07:26,128 --> 01:07:28,174
incapacitated him.

953
01:07:28,348 --> 01:07:30,219
Oh, yeah,
just let me out of here.

954
01:07:30,393 --> 01:07:32,961
That would be interfering
with the hunt.

955
01:07:33,135 --> 01:07:35,790
But... this is what you'll do.

956
01:07:35,964 --> 01:07:37,661
When you're discovered,

957
01:07:37,835 --> 01:07:39,837
you'll say
you're a priest from Nigeria

958
01:07:40,011 --> 01:07:41,839
staying with family in Detroit.

959
01:07:42,013 --> 01:07:44,190
You decided to see the church,

960
01:07:44,364 --> 01:07:47,628
and came upon vandals
robbing the donations box.

961
01:07:47,802 --> 01:07:50,413
They beat you and locked you up.

962
01:07:50,587 --> 01:07:53,460
Hey, it could be hours
till I'm found.

963
01:07:53,634 --> 01:07:55,244
Yes.

964
01:07:55,418 --> 01:07:57,768
Good day.

965
01:07:57,942 --> 01:07:59,596
The situation's handled, sir.

966
01:08:00,945 --> 01:08:03,252
Oh, I got to go.
It's the runner.

967
01:08:03,426 --> 01:08:07,082
Dodge, you continue to impress.

968
01:08:07,256 --> 01:08:09,084
You gave them a file on me?

969
01:08:09,258 --> 01:08:10,912
Carter used it to find me.

970
01:08:11,086 --> 01:08:12,348
Well, yeah, after we met,

971
01:08:12,522 --> 01:08:13,958
I had my team do a little recon
on you.

972
01:08:14,133 --> 01:08:15,569
It's all part of the hunt.

973
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:18,528
Yeah. Yeah, well,
the hunt's on hold, asshole.

974
01:08:18,702 --> 01:08:20,878
That psycho Carter took a chunk
out of my leg.

975
01:08:21,052 --> 01:08:22,793
Yeah, I'm afraid
that's a "you" problem.

976
01:08:22,967 --> 01:08:24,926
Fuck you. I thought
you wanted a fair hunt.

977
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:28,234
I explained the rules to you.
No do-overs, no time-outs.

978
01:08:28,408 --> 01:08:30,975
If you're injured, I suggest
you tend to your wounds.

979
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:33,848
Well, keep up the good work,
kid.

980
01:08:34,022 --> 01:08:35,632
I'm rooting for you.

981
01:08:36,764 --> 01:08:38,592
H-Hello?

982
01:08:38,766 --> 01:08:40,768
Ah, you prick.

983
01:08:49,298 --> 01:08:52,823
Yeah, great. Just great.

984
01:09:12,887 --> 01:09:15,411
Ah, fuck!

985
01:09:44,484 --> 01:09:46,660
Fuck! Aah!

986
01:09:50,881 --> 01:09:52,840
Oh, fuck. I can't run.

987
01:09:53,014 --> 01:09:54,233
I can't fucking run.

988
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:00,848
Hmm.

989
01:10:12,990 --> 01:10:14,992
Interesting.

990
01:10:20,041 --> 01:10:21,042
Mr. Sellars.

991
01:10:21,216 --> 01:10:22,652
Is Connell in place?

992
01:10:22,826 --> 01:10:25,089
Well, Connell is never
too far from the prey,

993
01:10:25,264 --> 01:10:27,266
but will not be seen
by you or any hunter,

994
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,615
unless he wants to be seen.

995
01:10:28,789 --> 01:10:30,269
Now, I assume you ask because

996
01:10:30,443 --> 01:10:31,966
you think you have
a beat on Tynes?

997
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:33,141
The expression is "have a bead,"

998
01:10:33,315 --> 01:10:34,621
Mr. Sellars, not a beat.

999
01:10:34,795 --> 01:10:36,318
And, no, I cannot
have a bead on him,

1000
01:10:36,492 --> 01:10:37,841
because a bead is the metal
protuberance on the end

1001
01:10:38,015 --> 01:10:39,669
of a gun barrel,
which helps a shooter aim.

1002
01:10:39,843 --> 01:10:42,019
And, we're not permitted
to use guns to take our prey.

1003
01:10:42,193 --> 01:10:43,891
Condescending asshole.

1004
01:10:44,065 --> 01:10:47,155
Now, I see you're
at the corner of, uh,

1005
01:10:47,329 --> 01:10:50,593
Lafayette and Chrysler,
just outside Greektown.

1006
01:10:50,767 --> 01:10:53,422
And I've been tracking Dodge
for the past several hours.

1007
01:10:53,596 --> 01:10:54,989
Each hour, he's moved
closer to downtown,

1008
01:10:55,163 --> 01:10:56,991
but he's covering
less ground each time.

1009
01:10:57,165 --> 01:10:58,862
He's an athlete--
he wouldn't be getting

1010
01:10:59,036 --> 01:11:00,647
this tired
so soon into the game.

1011
01:11:00,821 --> 01:11:02,344
I've concluded that he's hurt.

1012
01:11:02,518 --> 01:11:05,129
Well, I can neither
confirm nor deny.

1013
01:11:05,304 --> 01:11:07,393
I wasn't asking you to.
I would never attempt

1014
01:11:07,567 --> 01:11:08,916
to glean non-permitted
information.

1015
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:10,874
I always play by the rules.

1016
01:11:11,048 --> 01:11:12,702
Apologies.
It was not my intent

1017
01:11:12,876 --> 01:11:14,051
to suggest otherwise.

1018
01:11:14,225 --> 01:11:15,314
Be that as it may,

1019
01:11:15,488 --> 01:11:16,880
this call is a courtesy.

1020
01:11:17,054 --> 01:11:18,795
You might want to get
your ducks in a row.

1021
01:11:18,969 --> 01:11:20,971
It will be46 soon.

1022
01:11:21,145 --> 01:11:23,365
I believe the GPS
will show Dodge to be close.

1023
01:11:23,539 --> 01:11:25,672
And he won't
get away from me twice.

1024
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:32,461
Well, he is kind of close.

1025
01:11:32,635 --> 01:11:35,856
Dodge, you're picking
the wrong time to catch a game.

1026
01:11:42,645 --> 01:11:44,212
Here's Clutterbuck
right into the middle

1027
01:11:44,386 --> 01:11:46,432
and Bernier had to come up
with a big stop!

1028
01:11:46,606 --> 01:11:48,172
He also got belted.

1029
01:11:48,347 --> 01:11:50,653
Right out of the box,
back in for Bertuzzi.

1030
01:11:50,827 --> 01:11:53,003
Sends it rink wide.
Dylan Larkin

1031
01:11:53,177 --> 01:11:54,962
-able to keep that puck in.
-What's the score?

1032
01:11:55,136 --> 01:11:57,443
Three-two, Islanders.
We have no offense.

1033
01:11:57,617 --> 01:11:58,487
How much time left?

1034
01:11:58,661 --> 01:12:00,794
Uh, couple of minutes.

1035
01:12:00,968 --> 01:12:02,143
It's gonna be close.

1036
01:12:02,317 --> 01:12:03,710
Huh?

1037
01:12:03,884 --> 01:12:05,364
Nothing.

1038
01:12:05,538 --> 01:12:08,976
You mind if I hang out
and listen for a while?

1039
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:11,326
Nah. Move along.

1040
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:13,807
You guys are always trying
to five-finger my inventory.

1041
01:12:13,981 --> 01:12:15,417
"You guys"?

1042
01:12:15,591 --> 01:12:16,940
I'm not homeless.

1043
01:12:17,114 --> 01:12:18,768
I was in an accident.
It's a long story.

1044
01:12:18,942 --> 01:12:20,466
Come on, man,
I just want to hear the game.

1045
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,729
Suit yourself.

1046
01:12:22,903 --> 01:12:24,861
Thanks.

1047
01:12:25,035 --> 01:12:26,689
Hey, you wouldn't have
anything to drink, would you?

1048
01:12:26,863 --> 01:12:27,734
I'm dying of thirst.

1049
01:12:27,908 --> 01:12:28,865
Only sell merch.

1050
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:30,171
Want to buy a program?

1051
01:12:30,345 --> 01:12:32,216
Well, I got no cash.

1052
01:12:32,391 --> 01:12:34,828
Be happy I don't
charge you to listen.

1053
01:12:35,002 --> 01:12:37,004
Come on, Detroit!

1054
01:12:38,788 --> 01:12:40,964
Cops said stay by the phone,
but no one's calling.

1055
01:12:41,138 --> 01:12:42,357
It's almost sunset.

1056
01:12:42,531 --> 01:12:44,272
What if he's
in a ditch somewhere?

1057
01:12:44,446 --> 01:12:45,447
I reached out
to everyone we know.

1058
01:12:45,621 --> 01:12:46,709
No one's heard from him.

1059
01:12:46,883 --> 01:12:48,058
Is the money still coming in?

1060
01:12:48,232 --> 01:12:50,104
Yeah, over 2.2 million.

1061
01:12:50,278 --> 01:12:52,062
Jesus. How?

1062
01:12:52,236 --> 01:12:53,890
I don't know.
He knew a million money guys

1063
01:12:54,064 --> 01:12:56,023
with access
to that kind of cash.

1064
01:12:56,197 --> 01:12:57,981
I'm gonna check his records.

1065
01:12:58,155 --> 01:12:59,722
Okay, well,
I'm gonna do another lap

1066
01:12:59,896 --> 01:13:00,810
around the neighborhood,
'cause I'm losing my mind

1067
01:13:00,984 --> 01:13:02,377
just sitting here.

1068
01:13:02,551 --> 01:13:04,292
You want Janice
to come back over?

1069
01:13:04,466 --> 01:13:06,468
Uh... no.

1070
01:13:06,642 --> 01:13:08,252
I want to be alone.

1071
01:13:08,427 --> 01:13:09,340
Okay.

1072
01:13:09,515 --> 01:13:10,864
Everything's gonna be all right.

1073
01:13:11,038 --> 01:13:13,083
Just call me
if you find anything.

1074
01:13:15,956 --> 01:13:18,437
Another save by Greiss!
Detroit down by one,

1075
01:13:18,611 --> 01:13:20,351
with an empty net
and a man advantage.

1076
01:13:20,526 --> 01:13:22,266
Oh! Larkin rang one
off the crossbar,

1077
01:13:22,441 --> 01:13:23,572
-missing a goal by inches!
-Yes.

1078
01:13:23,746 --> 01:13:25,356
What, are you from New York?

1079
01:13:25,531 --> 01:13:27,533
No. No, I'm from here.

1080
01:13:30,971 --> 01:13:33,060
30 seconds left in the game.
New York can't

1081
01:13:33,234 --> 01:13:35,236
-get the puck
out of their own end!
-I'll see you later, man.

1082
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:37,325
Oh! Bertuzzi just misses

1083
01:13:37,499 --> 01:13:39,066
-on the glove side!
-Come on!

1084
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:41,242
Put the puck in the back
of the damn net!

1085
01:13:42,896 --> 01:13:45,464
It's desperation time now.

1086
01:13:45,638 --> 01:13:47,553
A flurry of activity, but still

1087
01:13:47,727 --> 01:13:50,512
not getting close to the goal.

1088
01:13:50,686 --> 01:13:53,384
It's moments like these where
you really feel the anxiety

1089
01:13:53,559 --> 01:13:55,256
because you know
you're running out of time.

1090
01:14:21,325 --> 01:14:23,806
Larkin drops it back
to Kronwall... slapshot!

1091
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:26,330
Blocked by Hickey,
picked up by Boychuk!

1092
01:14:26,505 --> 01:14:28,202
-He fires it down the ice

1093
01:14:28,376 --> 01:14:30,596
just as the horn sounds!

1094
01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:33,903
Detroit loses a nail-biter,
three to two!

1095
01:14:40,388 --> 01:14:41,824
Here we go.

1096
01:14:51,138 --> 01:14:53,619
Nine wolverine,
eight wolverine...

1097
01:14:56,186 --> 01:14:57,448
Seven...

1098
01:14:57,623 --> 01:14:59,276
six...

1099
01:14:59,450 --> 01:15:00,930
Five wolverine...

1100
01:15:01,104 --> 01:15:02,758
four wolverine...

1101
01:15:02,932 --> 01:15:04,630
three wolverine...

1102
01:15:04,804 --> 01:15:07,241
two wolverine, one wolverine.

1103
01:15:41,144 --> 01:15:42,276
Dodge!

1104
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:45,061
Dodge, I know you're here, mate!

1105
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:53,417
You can't run anymore,
so now you hide.

1106
01:15:53,592 --> 01:15:55,332
Right in plain sight.

1107
01:15:55,506 --> 01:15:57,900
You clever, clever boy.

1108
01:15:58,988 --> 01:16:00,860
Dodge!

1109
01:16:01,034 --> 01:16:03,166
Oh, Dodge Tynes!

1110
01:16:31,978 --> 01:16:34,371
Hey! Hey, you! Hey!

1111
01:16:34,545 --> 01:16:36,286
-Hey, take the jersey off. Hey!
-All right, all right,
just keep it down.

1112
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:38,680
Hey, take it off, you thief!
Take it off!

1113
01:16:38,854 --> 01:16:40,073
Just keep it down.

1114
01:16:40,247 --> 01:16:41,857
Take it off!

1115
01:16:51,214 --> 01:16:52,999
Oh, come on.

1116
01:16:53,173 --> 01:16:55,784
-Could you hurry up?
-No, because you never took

1117
01:16:55,958 --> 01:16:57,481
-the laundry out of the trunk.
-Let's just get them

1118
01:16:57,656 --> 01:16:59,179
in the car seats and then
we'll finish loading up.

1119
01:17:30,036 --> 01:17:32,691
Ooh.

1120
01:17:32,865 --> 01:17:34,867
That's gonna be
a cold one tonight, Dodge.

1121
01:17:37,608 --> 01:17:40,263
Yeah, Connell?

1122
01:17:40,437 --> 01:17:42,091
Yeah, I saw the speed
on the monitor.

1123
01:17:42,265 --> 01:17:44,615
I assume he's on a bus.

1124
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:47,183
In a car?

1125
01:17:51,013 --> 01:17:54,103
Dodge, you have no idea
what you're doing.

1126
01:18:04,244 --> 01:18:06,333
Okay, Mikey's got
"Bingo" on repeat.

1127
01:18:06,507 --> 01:18:08,509
Davey's got his juice.

1128
01:18:08,683 --> 01:18:11,642
And before you know it,
we'll be back in Birmingham.

1129
01:18:11,817 --> 01:18:13,775
The game takes place
in Detroit only.

1130
01:18:13,949 --> 01:18:16,125
You leave the city's confines,

1131
01:18:16,299 --> 01:18:19,259
that's a violation,
and then the game never ends.

1132
01:18:19,433 --> 01:18:21,478
Shit.

1133
01:18:32,968 --> 01:18:34,622
Don't be such a grump.

1134
01:18:34,796 --> 01:18:37,103
You know the words,
just sing the song.

1135
01:18:38,408 --> 01:18:41,281
-Shh. Quiet.

1136
01:18:41,455 --> 01:18:43,674
-I think I hear something.

1137
01:18:43,849 --> 01:18:45,241
What the hell is that?

1138
01:18:45,415 --> 01:18:48,070
I think it's coming
from the trunk.

1139
01:18:48,244 --> 01:18:49,463
You're getting off the freeway?

1140
01:18:52,292 --> 01:18:54,773
I mean, it's not exactly
the best neighborhood.

1141
01:19:12,181 --> 01:19:14,140
-What is it?
-How should I know?

1142
01:19:14,314 --> 01:19:16,969
Do you think it's like
a raccoon or something?

1143
01:19:18,666 --> 01:19:20,276
I think I'll know in a second.

1144
01:19:23,410 --> 01:19:25,238
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-Holy shit!

1145
01:19:25,412 --> 01:19:26,500
Are we still in the city limits?

1146
01:19:26,674 --> 01:19:28,807
How did you get in my car?

1147
01:19:28,981 --> 01:19:30,504
-Are we still in Detroit?
-We have a homeless man
accosting us

1148
01:19:30,678 --> 01:19:32,027
-on 6 Mile Road!
-Hey! No-no-no,
you can't call the cops!

1149
01:19:32,201 --> 01:19:33,028
Hey, hey, come on, stop!

1150
01:19:35,204 --> 01:19:36,553
Ah!

1151
01:19:36,727 --> 01:19:38,860
Give me your phone.

1152
01:19:39,034 --> 01:19:40,166
Give me your fucking phone!

1153
01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:54,223
Please. Don't hurt them.

1154
01:19:59,141 --> 01:20:00,795
I'm so...

1155
01:20:00,969 --> 01:20:02,971
I'm sorry.

1156
01:21:11,431 --> 01:21:13,955
Hey! Where do you think
you're going?!

1157
01:21:16,653 --> 01:21:18,612
I'm going home.

1158
01:21:28,230 --> 01:21:31,146
Stolen taxi reported
just off 6 Mile.

1159
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:34,019
Suspect description
matches our runner.

1160
01:21:34,193 --> 01:21:36,412
Yeah, he's ten hours
into the game.

1161
01:21:36,586 --> 01:21:39,241
He's mentally exhausted.
It's a calculated risk.

1162
01:21:39,415 --> 01:21:41,809
He knows cops aren't putting
a stolen cab

1163
01:21:41,983 --> 01:21:43,419
-on the top of their to-do list.
-Agreed.

1164
01:21:43,593 --> 01:21:45,421
But there was another report
of a vagrant

1165
01:21:45,595 --> 01:21:47,597
assaulting a family,
not far from the car theft.

1166
01:21:47,771 --> 01:21:50,557
Suspect description
also matches our runner.

1167
01:21:50,731 --> 01:21:52,428
Assaulting a family?

1168
01:21:54,082 --> 01:21:57,433
Well, the hunt broke
a Panamanian general

1169
01:21:57,607 --> 01:21:59,131
in Colón City four years ago;

1170
01:21:59,305 --> 01:22:00,610
why wouldn't
the same thing happen

1171
01:22:00,784 --> 01:22:02,438
to a real estate developer
in Detroit?

1172
01:22:02,612 --> 01:22:04,353
Sir?

1173
01:22:04,527 --> 01:22:08,053
Tynes isn't using any evasive
or deceptive driving techniques.

1174
01:22:08,227 --> 01:22:11,056
It appears he has a very
specific destination in mind.

1175
01:22:38,431 --> 01:22:41,042
Looger, I know
every supplier, vendor,

1176
01:22:41,216 --> 01:22:42,696
contractor Dodge works with.

1177
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:44,306
None of them are named
Miles Sellars.

1178
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,395
"Assurance For Those
Without Insurance"?

1179
01:22:46,569 --> 01:22:47,918
He has no insurance!

1180
01:23:27,784 --> 01:23:29,351
Hang on a sec.

1181
01:23:41,102 --> 01:23:42,408
I just saw Dodge!

1182
01:24:16,268 --> 01:24:17,573
Ah, shit.

1183
01:24:41,728 --> 01:24:44,165
-Ah!

1184
01:25:38,524 --> 01:25:41,179
So predictable.

1185
01:25:42,963 --> 01:25:45,095
I knew you'd run back home
to see your wife

1186
01:25:45,270 --> 01:25:47,054
once the reality sunk in.

1187
01:25:47,228 --> 01:25:50,623
Reality of what
your new normal was.

1188
01:25:50,797 --> 01:25:52,799
Of what you have become.

1189
01:25:57,238 --> 01:25:59,414
But there's one thing
you could never become.

1190
01:25:59,588 --> 01:26:02,896
You could never become a killer.

1191
01:26:05,725 --> 01:26:08,989
You couldn't do it in the church
and you can't do it now.

1192
01:26:09,163 --> 01:26:13,385
You know if you let me live,
I will come back after you,

1193
01:26:13,559 --> 01:26:16,518
and yet you still cannot deliver
the fatal blow.

1194
01:26:21,219 --> 01:26:22,611
Perhaps...

1195
01:26:22,785 --> 01:26:25,353
I will see you
on the street, eh?

1196
01:26:25,527 --> 01:26:27,442
Or in an alley?

1197
01:26:27,616 --> 01:26:30,706
Or back home.

1198
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:32,665
Eh, with your wife.

1199
01:26:32,839 --> 01:26:36,712
Maybe I'll go right there
once I extricate myself.

1200
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:39,933
Wait there for you again, eh?

1201
01:26:41,978 --> 01:26:45,243
With your lovely bride, Valerie.

1202
01:26:45,417 --> 01:26:47,549
She and I will have much fun.

1203
01:26:47,723 --> 01:26:51,336
I will scar her so bad,
you will never forget me.

1204
01:26:51,510 --> 01:26:52,902
I will break her like I...

1205
01:26:53,076 --> 01:26:53,860
You're dead!

1206
01:27:23,803 --> 01:27:25,413
Hello?

1207
01:27:34,814 --> 01:27:36,250
Hello?

1208
01:27:52,005 --> 01:27:53,093
The body?

1209
01:27:53,267 --> 01:27:55,095
Steel coffin filled with lye

1210
01:27:55,269 --> 01:27:57,489
at the bottom of Lake St. Clair.

1211
01:27:57,663 --> 01:28:00,056
Along with
the DNA-covered cinderblock.

1212
01:28:00,230 --> 01:28:02,102
Uh-huh. Motorcycle?

1213
01:28:02,276 --> 01:28:04,017
Wiped down.
Serial numbers removed.

1214
01:28:04,191 --> 01:28:05,758
-The cab?
-I left it.

1215
01:28:05,932 --> 01:28:08,804
It was reported stolen,
so this was the end of a...

1216
01:28:08,978 --> 01:28:10,197
drunken joy ride.

1217
01:28:10,371 --> 01:28:11,677
Torched it to be safe.

1218
01:28:11,851 --> 01:28:12,765
Good job.

1219
01:28:12,939 --> 01:28:14,288
Got to be honest,

1220
01:28:14,462 --> 01:28:15,985
I didn't think Dodge
had it in him.

1221
01:28:17,422 --> 01:28:20,033
You should...
you should get back on his tail.

1222
01:28:20,207 --> 01:28:23,079
He's been wandering for hours.

1223
01:28:23,253 --> 01:28:25,386
When his location's
been revealed,

1224
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:28,215
his concealment efforts
have been weak.

1225
01:28:28,389 --> 01:28:30,609
He's lucky he hasn't been found.

1226
01:28:32,785 --> 01:28:35,048
It's first-kill shell shock.

1227
01:28:35,222 --> 01:28:37,006
Well... very likely,

1228
01:28:37,180 --> 01:28:39,966
but he might not be long
for the game.

1229
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:42,360
So, prep for Wrap-Up.

1230
01:29:00,029 --> 01:29:01,030
May I have a water, please?

1231
01:29:02,031 --> 01:29:03,032
No water.
Coke, Dr Pepper or Sprite.

1232
01:29:04,033 --> 01:29:05,034
Dr Pepper.

1233
01:29:05,905 --> 01:29:07,472
One dollar.

1234
01:29:09,387 --> 01:29:11,258
Please, man, I'm so thirsty.

1235
01:29:11,432 --> 01:29:13,434
Get lost. You smackheads
are ruining the city.

1236
01:29:13,608 --> 01:29:15,349
Beat it.

1237
01:29:34,673 --> 01:29:36,936
Just give me a soda!

1238
01:29:38,285 --> 01:29:39,591
All right, all right.

1239
01:29:39,765 --> 01:29:41,462
Try that again,
I'll whip your ass sober!

1240
01:29:41,636 --> 01:29:42,811
All right. Yeah.

1241
01:29:49,165 --> 01:29:51,472
-I need a ticket, right?
-Yes, ma'am.

1242
01:30:02,788 --> 01:30:04,311
Excuse me.
How long is this thing?

1243
01:30:04,485 --> 01:30:06,531
Oh, it's a 40-minute
shoreline tour of the city.

1244
01:30:06,705 --> 01:30:08,358
There are headphones available
that provide a history

1245
01:30:08,533 --> 01:30:10,404
of Detroit,
from Motown to motorcars.

1246
01:30:10,578 --> 01:30:11,797
Perfect. Thank you.

1247
01:30:11,971 --> 01:30:13,538
Sorry, are you all right?

1248
01:30:13,712 --> 01:30:15,148
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

1249
01:30:15,322 --> 01:30:17,150
Well, the buffet starts in ten.

1250
01:30:17,324 --> 01:30:18,934
The captain will announce
when it's ready.

1251
01:30:19,108 --> 01:30:20,066
Free buffet?

1252
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:22,242
That's great.

1253
01:30:23,591 --> 01:30:25,811
Yeah, keep looking, asshole.

1254
01:30:25,985 --> 01:30:28,553
I'm gonna get some ribs.

1255
01:30:57,016 --> 01:30:58,757
Ah-ah-ah.
I thought I told you,

1256
01:30:58,931 --> 01:31:00,498
the buffet starts
in ten minutes.

1257
01:31:00,672 --> 01:31:02,021
Sorry, I'm just really thirsty.

1258
01:31:02,195 --> 01:31:04,023
Yeah, well...

1259
01:31:04,197 --> 01:31:06,242
the hunt'll do that
to you, Dodge.

1260
01:31:06,416 --> 01:31:08,157
Oh, fuck me.

1261
01:32:12,482 --> 01:32:13,788
Hey, Dodge!

1262
01:32:14,876 --> 01:32:15,834
Do you like this game?

1263
01:32:16,008 --> 01:32:17,400
Not my favorite.

1264
01:32:17,575 --> 01:32:19,359
Well, you better
get used to it, 'cause...

1265
01:32:19,533 --> 01:32:22,231
once we go under that bridge,
we're in Canadian waters.

1266
01:32:22,405 --> 01:32:24,538
And then the game never ends.

1267
01:32:46,604 --> 01:32:48,344
You got to be shittin' me.

1268
01:33:07,842 --> 01:33:10,192
He was trapped on a boat.

1269
01:33:10,366 --> 01:33:12,542
-With Kennedy.
-With Kennedy. And there he is,

1270
01:33:12,717 --> 01:33:15,154
the only one walking
out of the ring. Huh.

1271
01:33:15,328 --> 01:33:17,765
But how long can he keep it up?

1272
01:33:27,819 --> 01:33:30,169
Hours will pass.

1273
01:33:30,343 --> 01:33:32,345
Midnight will come and go.

1274
01:33:33,433 --> 01:33:37,045
His movement will lose purpose

1275
01:33:37,219 --> 01:33:40,353
and then cease
for long stretches

1276
01:33:40,527 --> 01:33:42,572
as exhaustion sets in.

1277
01:33:44,662 --> 01:33:48,491
When his location's given up,
he'll barely react.

1278
01:33:53,496 --> 01:33:55,150
The irony is,

1279
01:33:55,324 --> 01:33:58,066
when he's just a few
scant hours from freedom,

1280
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:00,286
after all he's been through...

1281
01:34:02,636 --> 01:34:04,899
...he'll be incapable
of believing

1282
01:34:05,073 --> 01:34:07,075
it'll ever come to an end.

1283
01:34:58,692 --> 01:35:00,563
I'm sorry, Val.

1284
01:35:04,045 --> 01:35:05,960
Get in!

1285
01:35:10,095 --> 01:35:13,272
Bro, that's, like, a month old.

1286
01:35:13,446 --> 01:35:15,535
Look, I don't know what
you got yourself caught up in,

1287
01:35:15,709 --> 01:35:17,537
but whatever it is,
we're gonna figure it out, okay?

1288
01:35:17,711 --> 01:35:19,408
How the hell did you find me?

1289
01:35:19,582 --> 01:35:21,367
Driving all night.

1290
01:35:21,541 --> 01:35:23,891
And then I remembered you used
to go to that playground to hide

1291
01:35:24,065 --> 01:35:25,675
when your dad got sick.

1292
01:35:25,850 --> 01:35:27,634
But never mind how I found you--

1293
01:35:27,808 --> 01:35:30,115
what the hell is going on?

1294
01:35:30,289 --> 01:35:31,986
Can't tell you.

1295
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:35,207
Just drive me around
for the next 57 minutes,

1296
01:35:35,381 --> 01:35:36,861
-and then I got to go.
-Why?

1297
01:35:37,035 --> 01:35:38,558
Why 57 minutes?

1298
01:35:38,732 --> 01:35:40,647
Is somebody after you?
'Cause of that money?

1299
01:35:40,821 --> 01:35:43,215
Yes. Yes on both counts.

1300
01:35:43,389 --> 01:35:45,521
Look, I'm just doing
what you told me to, man.

1301
01:35:45,695 --> 01:35:47,045
I'm fighting.

1302
01:35:47,219 --> 01:35:49,308
Fighting with everything I got.

1303
01:35:53,225 --> 01:35:54,530
Ah, shit.

1304
01:35:54,704 --> 01:35:56,881
-You got to lose this guy.
-Who is it?

1305
01:35:57,055 --> 01:35:58,447
It doesn't matter.
He'll kill both of us.

1306
01:35:58,621 --> 01:35:59,666
Just drive.

1307
01:36:09,110 --> 01:36:11,721
Up here. Hug the turn
as close as you can get.

1308
01:36:11,896 --> 01:36:12,853
And, Looger,
promise me something.

1309
01:36:13,027 --> 01:36:15,203
-Yeah?
-Don't follow me.

1310
01:36:15,377 --> 01:36:16,465
Dodge!

1311
01:36:39,271 --> 01:36:41,708
Hey, man, you got five bucks?

1312
01:37:03,817 --> 01:37:05,079
Shit.

1313
01:37:05,253 --> 01:37:06,951
Damn right.

1314
01:37:12,130 --> 01:37:13,609
What the hell happened, Looger?

1315
01:37:13,783 --> 01:37:15,829
I had him in my truck,
and he jumped out.

1316
01:37:16,003 --> 01:37:18,440
I wrecked, and by the time
I came to, he was gone.

1317
01:37:18,614 --> 01:37:20,094
He jumped out of a moving truck?

1318
01:37:20,268 --> 01:37:22,880
Someone was chasing us.
Okay, I don't know who,

1319
01:37:23,054 --> 01:37:24,882
but he is
up-to-his-eyelids deep in it.

1320
01:37:25,056 --> 01:37:26,753
They beat him up pretty bad.

1321
01:37:26,927 --> 01:37:28,886
-Oh, my God.
-He's dealing
with dangerous people,

1322
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:30,017
which is why I called.

1323
01:37:30,191 --> 01:37:31,410
It'll be safest here.

1324
01:37:31,584 --> 01:37:34,892
I can't believe
this is happening.

1325
01:37:35,066 --> 01:37:36,763
I'm telling you,
you got to let me go,

1326
01:37:36,937 --> 01:37:38,330
or things
are gonna jump off in here

1327
01:37:38,504 --> 01:37:39,548
in ways you can't understand.

1328
01:37:42,377 --> 01:37:44,075
Oh, I understand real good.

1329
01:37:44,249 --> 01:37:46,251
I understand
only two kinds of white folk

1330
01:37:46,425 --> 01:37:49,254
come into my projects-- cops...

1331
01:37:49,428 --> 01:37:50,690
and dealers.

1332
01:37:50,864 --> 01:37:52,257
You ain't no cop.

1333
01:37:52,431 --> 01:37:53,780
I'm not a dealer, either.

1334
01:37:53,954 --> 01:37:56,043
Really? 'Cause you got
all them pockets,

1335
01:37:56,217 --> 01:37:58,524
but you only had
two things on you.

1336
01:37:59,481 --> 01:38:00,526
This.

1337
01:38:02,354 --> 01:38:04,747
And, uh...

1338
01:38:04,922 --> 01:38:06,749
this.

1339
01:38:11,145 --> 01:38:13,843
And you only have one app
on that phone.

1340
01:38:14,018 --> 01:38:15,802
And when I opened it...

1341
01:38:15,976 --> 01:38:18,109
well, you have much money
going into your account--

1342
01:38:18,283 --> 01:38:20,154
I'm talking buckets of duckets.

1343
01:38:20,328 --> 01:38:21,547
Hey, yo, KG,
how much you add up, baby?

1344
01:38:21,721 --> 01:38:23,114
Over 15 million.

1345
01:38:23,288 --> 01:38:25,420
Goddamn!

1346
01:38:26,421 --> 01:38:28,249
Now, look...

1347
01:38:28,423 --> 01:38:30,208
I don't know much,

1348
01:38:30,382 --> 01:38:32,384
but I know you a payday.

1349
01:38:33,689 --> 01:38:35,256
You see that phone?

1350
01:38:35,430 --> 01:38:37,563
It says44.

1351
01:38:37,737 --> 01:38:39,739
In two minutes,
it's gonna chime,

1352
01:38:39,913 --> 01:38:41,741
and if I don't get out of here,

1353
01:38:41,915 --> 01:38:44,613
all hell's gonna break loose.

1354
01:38:44,787 --> 01:38:46,572
One of them's already here.

1355
01:38:46,746 --> 01:38:49,227
Yo, Casper be trippin', man.

1356
01:38:49,401 --> 01:38:52,056
One of who? Who you know
got that kind of green?

1357
01:38:52,230 --> 01:38:53,579
'Cause my connection
didn't tell me

1358
01:38:53,753 --> 01:38:55,102
they were sending nobody up
to come see me,

1359
01:38:55,276 --> 01:38:57,452
so you got to be working
for them other boys

1360
01:38:57,626 --> 01:39:00,064
trying to hustle their
fake-ass product into Motown.

1361
01:39:00,238 --> 01:39:03,284
Now, if them boys
want their man back...

1362
01:39:03,458 --> 01:39:05,721
they gonna have to pay.

1363
01:39:05,895 --> 01:39:08,028
Fake-ass product? What
the hell are you talking about?

1364
01:39:09,464 --> 01:39:10,900
What, my pain pills?

1365
01:39:11,075 --> 01:39:12,467
Bitch, these ain't shit.

1366
01:39:12,641 --> 01:39:13,903
I popped 'em, snorted 'em--

1367
01:39:14,078 --> 01:39:15,557
ain't nothin' but aspirin.

1368
01:39:15,731 --> 01:39:17,733
What? No, th-they're real.

1369
01:39:17,907 --> 01:39:19,213
Real-ass bullshit.

1370
01:39:19,387 --> 01:39:20,780
Listen to me, all right?

1371
01:39:20,954 --> 01:39:22,347
In less than a minute,

1372
01:39:22,521 --> 01:39:24,218
there is gonna be
some coldhearted killers

1373
01:39:24,392 --> 01:39:25,915
coming down here in force.

1374
01:39:26,090 --> 01:39:27,569
You get between me and them,

1375
01:39:27,743 --> 01:39:28,962
-they'll take you out, too.
-Hear me, son.

1376
01:39:29,136 --> 01:39:31,095
I'm getting that money.

1377
01:39:31,269 --> 01:39:32,922
Now, you can either help me
get it easy,

1378
01:39:33,097 --> 01:39:35,360
or you can help me get it
after you feel some true pain.

1379
01:39:36,926 --> 01:39:38,276
All right, have it your way.

1380
01:39:38,450 --> 01:39:39,799
You don't want to let me go?

1381
01:39:39,973 --> 01:39:41,279
There's a British guy
with an ice pick,

1382
01:39:41,453 --> 01:39:42,889
a redneck with a knife,
and an Asian chick

1383
01:39:43,063 --> 01:39:44,717
that'll just straight kick
the shit out of you.

1384
01:39:44,891 --> 01:39:48,242
They'll make sure you're feeling
as much true pain as anyone.

1385
01:39:55,467 --> 01:39:58,078
Hey, yo, fuck my boy up
for a little bit, man.

1386
01:39:58,252 --> 01:40:00,124
You're making a huge mistake.

1387
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:03,388
Deal with it, man!

1388
01:40:09,698 --> 01:40:11,309
I warned you.

1389
01:40:21,884 --> 01:40:22,929
-Oh, shit!

1390
01:40:26,585 --> 01:40:28,021
Get that nigga, man!

1391
01:40:28,195 --> 01:40:29,240
Yo, get that nigga!

1392
01:40:29,414 --> 01:40:31,024
Get that nigga, man!

1393
01:40:32,025 --> 01:40:33,766
Mind moving over?

1394
01:40:33,940 --> 01:40:35,420
-Yo, shoot, shoot, shoot!

1395
01:40:35,594 --> 01:40:37,378
Yo!

1396
01:40:41,426 --> 01:40:43,297
Shit!

1397
01:40:48,955 --> 01:40:51,871
-Shit!

1398
01:40:56,745 --> 01:40:59,096
-Cool.
-Fuck!

1399
01:41:15,721 --> 01:41:17,636
You're not allowed to use guns.

1400
01:41:17,810 --> 01:41:19,116
To kill you.

1401
01:41:19,290 --> 01:41:21,814
Besides,
I prefer this kind of heat.

1402
01:41:21,988 --> 01:41:24,817
50,000 volts, 200 amps.

1403
01:41:24,991 --> 01:41:26,819
-It'll hurt like hell,

1404
01:41:26,993 --> 01:41:28,864
but then you'll be dead.

1405
01:41:29,038 --> 01:41:31,563
This is my fifth hunt.

1406
01:41:31,737 --> 01:41:33,608
First time I've won.

1407
01:42:04,117 --> 01:42:06,598
Detroit PD. Back inside.

1408
01:42:13,474 --> 01:42:15,476
Run, Mr. Tynes.

1409
01:42:48,074 --> 01:42:50,250
LBJ's dead.

1410
01:42:51,599 --> 01:42:54,036
Nothing gets by you.

1411
01:43:34,076 --> 01:43:35,469
I know it's

1412
01:43:35,643 --> 01:43:36,992
the projects, Connell,

1413
01:43:37,166 --> 01:43:38,733
but there were
a hundred rounds fired,

1414
01:43:38,907 --> 01:43:40,518
and the authorities
will eventually show!

1415
01:43:40,692 --> 01:43:43,651
My job is one
of efficient precision.

1416
01:43:43,825 --> 01:43:46,741
If I rush, I fail.

1417
01:43:46,915 --> 01:43:48,221
I'm not telling you to rush.

1418
01:43:48,395 --> 01:43:50,876
I'm telling you
to hurry the hell up!

1419
01:44:04,846 --> 01:44:07,849
Why is he going to the hospital?

1420
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:15,727
Hey.

1421
01:44:15,901 --> 01:44:19,034
Uh, I was given
this prescription for headaches

1422
01:44:19,208 --> 01:44:21,254
from Dr. Singhal and Dr. Levy,
but I don't think they're

1423
01:44:21,428 --> 01:44:23,256
what they're supposed to be.
Could-could you check for me?

1424
01:44:23,430 --> 01:44:24,823
Metaxalone.

1425
01:44:24,997 --> 01:44:26,868
You want pain meds?
Cruise the park.

1426
01:44:27,042 --> 01:44:29,001
No, no, no. I just want
to know about the pills.

1427
01:44:31,046 --> 01:44:32,265
Come on, it's meloxicam.

1428
01:44:32,439 --> 01:44:33,614
An anti-inflammatory.

1429
01:44:33,788 --> 01:44:36,443
I give out a hundred a day.

1430
01:44:36,617 --> 01:44:38,532
C-Could you check your files?

1431
01:44:38,706 --> 01:44:41,361
It's under Dodge Tynes. Please.

1432
01:44:45,322 --> 01:44:48,368
No Dodge Tynes in our system.

1433
01:44:48,542 --> 01:44:51,415
No Dr. Singhal...

1434
01:44:51,589 --> 01:44:53,982
or Dr. Levy, either.

1435
01:44:54,156 --> 01:44:55,593
That can't be right.

1436
01:44:55,767 --> 01:44:57,464
I-I saw him in D wing
two days ago.

1437
01:44:57,638 --> 01:44:59,074
Nice try.

1438
01:44:59,248 --> 01:45:01,381
D wing has been
under construction for months.

1439
01:45:21,183 --> 01:45:22,402
Hello, Dodge.

1440
01:45:22,576 --> 01:45:24,143
You set me up.

1441
01:45:24,317 --> 01:45:25,971
Now I'm hunting you.

1442
01:45:26,145 --> 01:45:27,755
"Set up" is a charged term,

1443
01:45:27,929 --> 01:45:29,670
with nasty connotations.

1444
01:45:29,844 --> 01:45:32,151
I made sure you were
guided to me,

1445
01:45:32,325 --> 01:45:33,544
so I could help you.

1446
01:45:33,718 --> 01:45:35,546
Only reason I agreed
to this shit

1447
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:37,069
is 'cause I thought I was dying.

1448
01:45:37,243 --> 01:45:38,287
You weredying.

1449
01:45:38,462 --> 01:45:40,551
No money, no career, no future.

1450
01:45:40,725 --> 01:45:42,422
When was the last time
you really lived?

1451
01:45:42,596 --> 01:45:45,860
-I brought you back to life.
-Ah, screw it.

1452
01:45:46,034 --> 01:45:47,906
-I'm going to the cops.
-Yeah, to tell them what?

1453
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:53,781
You don't know my real name,
where I am, or how to find me.

1454
01:45:53,955 --> 01:45:56,480
Conversely, I not only know
a lot about you,

1455
01:45:56,654 --> 01:45:58,438
I know a lot about your wife.

1456
01:45:58,612 --> 01:46:01,267
Like where she's been every
moment since the hunt started.

1457
01:46:01,441 --> 01:46:04,705
In fact, I have a dear friend
looking after her as we speak.

1458
01:46:04,879 --> 01:46:06,490
My wife never agreed
to this game.

1459
01:46:06,664 --> 01:46:08,317
Hunters can't go near her.

1460
01:46:08,492 --> 01:46:11,320
Ah, it isn't a hunter.
It's a dear friend of yours.

1461
01:46:11,495 --> 01:46:12,800
Who knows you best?

1462
01:46:12,974 --> 01:46:15,412
Your habits,
your running routine?

1463
01:46:15,586 --> 01:46:17,979
Your water stash
at The Carrington?

1464
01:46:19,851 --> 01:46:21,330
Looger.

1465
01:46:21,505 --> 01:46:23,332
In your best friend,
we found a man

1466
01:46:23,507 --> 01:46:25,813
who watched you enter
a white-collar world

1467
01:46:25,987 --> 01:46:28,425
while his collar remained
a permanent shade of blue.

1468
01:46:28,599 --> 01:46:31,993
You borrow his last penny,
he never gets a cent back.

1469
01:46:32,167 --> 01:46:34,518
He-He's angry.
And desperate.

1470
01:46:34,692 --> 01:46:37,172
50 grand to drug your water.

1471
01:46:37,346 --> 01:46:39,000
Oh, God.

1472
01:46:39,174 --> 01:46:42,134
Oh, God isn't organized enough
to pull off what I do.

1473
01:46:42,308 --> 01:46:44,092
Fake cops following you
for weeks,

1474
01:46:44,266 --> 01:46:45,703
waiting for you to collapse.

1475
01:46:45,877 --> 01:46:48,183
Fraudulent doctors,
bogus orderlies.

1476
01:46:48,357 --> 01:46:51,143
I spent a fortune
getting you into this hunt,

1477
01:46:51,317 --> 01:46:53,493
and if you think
you can punch out

1478
01:46:53,667 --> 01:46:55,713
just because things
aren't exactly how they seemed,

1479
01:46:55,887 --> 01:46:57,454
then think again.

1480
01:46:57,628 --> 01:46:59,238
Besides, now you really have
something to fight for,

1481
01:46:59,412 --> 01:47:02,459
considering you have
decades more to live...

1482
01:47:02,633 --> 01:47:05,984
provided, of course, that
you survive the next 90 minutes.

1483
01:47:06,158 --> 01:47:07,333
You're insane.

1484
01:47:07,507 --> 01:47:09,248
All the greats are.

1485
01:47:09,422 --> 01:47:12,338
I understand you literally ran
into my associate, Connell,

1486
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:14,383
in the projects.

1487
01:47:14,558 --> 01:47:17,299
He says you now have a gun.
Guns are against the rules.

1488
01:47:17,474 --> 01:47:19,084
Well, rules are out
the window, asshole.

1489
01:47:19,258 --> 01:47:20,607
Okay, have it your way.

1490
01:47:20,781 --> 01:47:22,261
I'll notify
the remaining hunters

1491
01:47:22,435 --> 01:47:24,611
that guns are now permitted.

1492
01:47:24,785 --> 01:47:25,960
It's only fair.

1493
01:47:26,134 --> 01:47:28,267
Nothing about this
has been fair.

1494
01:47:28,441 --> 01:47:31,531
I admit, your entry
into this game

1495
01:47:31,705 --> 01:47:33,620
was not exactly forthright,

1496
01:47:33,794 --> 01:47:36,057
but the objective
remains the same.

1497
01:47:36,231 --> 01:47:38,364
You make it till sunrise,
you win.

1498
01:47:38,538 --> 01:47:39,583
Trust me on that.

1499
01:47:39,757 --> 01:47:41,541
I'm a man of my word.

1500
01:47:47,808 --> 01:47:48,983
-Hello?
-Hello.

1501
01:47:49,157 --> 01:47:51,116
You have a collect call from...

1502
01:47:51,290 --> 01:47:52,683
-Val, it's me, pick up.
-Will you accept the charges?

1503
01:47:52,857 --> 01:47:53,858
I accept the charges!

1504
01:47:54,032 --> 01:47:55,207
Val.

1505
01:47:55,381 --> 01:47:56,948
Dodge! Are you okay?

1506
01:47:57,122 --> 01:47:58,210
Val, listen.
Are you with Looger?

1507
01:47:58,384 --> 01:47:59,298
Yeah, he's right here.

1508
01:47:59,472 --> 01:48:00,473
Let me talk to him.

1509
01:48:00,647 --> 01:48:01,605
Can he hear me?

1510
01:48:01,779 --> 01:48:03,432
What? N-No.

1511
01:48:03,607 --> 01:48:04,608
Give me the phone.
I'll go get him.

1512
01:48:04,782 --> 01:48:05,957
Okay, listen,

1513
01:48:06,131 --> 01:48:07,611
we... we were lied to.

1514
01:48:07,785 --> 01:48:09,656
I'm not sick.
I don't have cancer.

1515
01:48:09,830 --> 01:48:11,745
-What do you mean?
-I can't explain right now,

1516
01:48:11,919 --> 01:48:13,573
but we're both in danger,
and Looger's a part of it.

1517
01:48:13,747 --> 01:48:15,967
Do you understand?
You got to get away from him.

1518
01:48:16,141 --> 01:48:17,708
Now you go to where
I proposed to you,

1519
01:48:17,882 --> 01:48:19,536
-and I'll be there
in 15 minutes.
-Yes, but...

1520
01:48:19,710 --> 01:48:20,972
No-no-no, Val,
you got to go now.

1521
01:48:21,146 --> 01:48:23,235
O-Okay.

1522
01:48:24,671 --> 01:48:27,282
What'd he say? Where is he?

1523
01:48:30,024 --> 01:48:32,984
-He said he's coming here.
-That's great.

1524
01:48:33,158 --> 01:48:34,768
Thank God.

1525
01:48:38,903 --> 01:48:40,992
I think I'm gonna get
some fresh air.

1526
01:48:41,166 --> 01:48:42,559
This has all just been
too much...

1527
01:48:42,733 --> 01:48:43,734
No way.

1528
01:48:43,908 --> 01:48:45,518
I don't want you
out of my sight.

1529
01:48:45,692 --> 01:48:47,651
Let's just wait for Dodge.

1530
01:48:47,825 --> 01:48:49,957
Okay.

1531
01:48:57,225 --> 01:48:59,140
Do you have any tea?

1532
01:49:00,402 --> 01:49:02,666
I think I just need something
to calm my nerves.

1533
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:04,015
I got chamomile.

1534
01:49:04,189 --> 01:49:05,930
It'll just take a sec.

1535
01:49:22,555 --> 01:49:25,819
-Yeah, Connell?

1536
01:49:25,993 --> 01:49:27,647
I'm recommending termination.

1537
01:49:27,821 --> 01:49:28,909
Oh, are you?

1538
01:49:29,083 --> 01:49:30,694
Tynes is a wild card now.

1539
01:49:30,868 --> 01:49:33,914
The investors are aware;
that puts us all at risk.

1540
01:49:34,088 --> 01:49:36,874
In the 2,000 years
since these games began,

1541
01:49:37,048 --> 01:49:40,486
since the bravest Roman tiros
shunned the Coliseums

1542
01:49:40,660 --> 01:49:42,183
for purer competition,

1543
01:49:42,357 --> 01:49:44,403
we have never ceased a game
prior to conclusion.

1544
01:49:44,577 --> 01:49:47,014
And I'm not about to have
the history of what's been built

1545
01:49:47,188 --> 01:49:49,669
over millennia, die on my watch!

1546
01:49:52,933 --> 01:49:56,067
We just have to motivate
our runner a little more.

1547
01:49:56,241 --> 01:49:57,546
Make sure he understands

1548
01:49:57,721 --> 01:50:00,245
there is a price to pay
if he goes rogue.

1549
01:50:21,701 --> 01:50:23,572
Mrs. Tynes?

1550
01:50:23,747 --> 01:50:24,878
You all right?

1551
01:50:25,052 --> 01:50:27,141
-Officer Watkins.
-Heh.

1552
01:50:27,315 --> 01:50:28,926
Thank God.

1553
01:50:34,322 --> 01:50:35,149
You're gonna come with us now.

1554
01:50:35,323 --> 01:50:36,368
-No.
-Come on.

1555
01:50:36,542 --> 01:50:38,152
-No! Help!
-Hey!

1556
01:50:38,326 --> 01:50:39,763
Stop!

1557
01:50:39,937 --> 01:50:41,895
Hey! Don't you go
and get her killed, Dodge.

1558
01:50:42,069 --> 01:50:43,636
-Dodge!
-I got a message for you
from Miles.

1559
01:50:43,810 --> 01:50:45,159
He says
"Finish what you started."

1560
01:50:45,333 --> 01:50:47,858
Get your hands off my wife.

1561
01:50:49,686 --> 01:50:51,383
It's not just your wife
I got in my hands, hmm?

1562
01:50:53,864 --> 01:50:55,735
-Dodge.
-Val.

1563
01:50:55,909 --> 01:50:56,910
Just finish the hunt!

1564
01:50:57,084 --> 01:50:59,086
No!

1565
01:51:26,723 --> 01:51:27,854
Mrs. Tynes.

1566
01:51:28,028 --> 01:51:29,769
Please don't hurt me.

1567
01:51:29,943 --> 01:51:32,511
Hurt you?
Heavens, no, of course not.

1568
01:51:32,685 --> 01:51:33,904
There's no need for those.

1569
01:51:38,647 --> 01:51:40,954
Please. Sit.

1570
01:51:41,128 --> 01:51:43,087
For the baby's sake.

1571
01:51:43,261 --> 01:51:46,873
You've been through a lot.

1572
01:51:47,047 --> 01:51:48,527
Are you gonna hurt my husband?

1573
01:51:48,701 --> 01:51:51,704
Me? No, I'm not going
to hurt him.

1574
01:51:51,878 --> 01:51:53,793
Please.

1575
01:51:56,927 --> 01:51:58,015
Who areyou?

1576
01:51:58,189 --> 01:52:01,105
Well, you can call me Miles.

1577
01:52:05,152 --> 01:52:09,678
And let me say I'm sorry
things played out like this.

1578
01:52:09,853 --> 01:52:11,593
Collaterals are rarely involved.

1579
01:52:11,768 --> 01:52:13,595
They almost never
learn the truth.

1580
01:52:13,770 --> 01:52:16,468
Typically, you would have
already received a visit

1581
01:52:16,642 --> 01:52:18,949
from the police informing you
your husband

1582
01:52:19,123 --> 01:52:22,082
was murdered, mugging
gone wrong, something like that.

1583
01:52:25,085 --> 01:52:26,957
No... he's not really police.

1584
01:52:27,131 --> 01:52:29,394
We tapped your phone
so we can redirect

1585
01:52:29,568 --> 01:52:32,397
outgoing calls.
So when you called the cops,

1586
01:52:32,571 --> 01:52:34,573
you reached us, and we sent over

1587
01:52:34,747 --> 01:52:36,793
Officer Watkins here.

1588
01:52:36,967 --> 01:52:38,403
Well, bottom line,

1589
01:52:38,577 --> 01:52:41,232
you would have received
a large amount

1590
01:52:41,406 --> 01:52:44,017
of untraceable cash,

1591
01:52:44,191 --> 01:52:47,238
explained away
as a massive insurance policy

1592
01:52:47,412 --> 01:52:48,848
Dodge never told you about;

1593
01:52:49,022 --> 01:52:52,547
something he purchased
back in the salad days.

1594
01:52:52,721 --> 01:52:54,506
But...

1595
01:52:54,680 --> 01:52:57,814
your husband turned out to be
tougher prey than we're used to.

1596
01:52:57,988 --> 01:52:59,946
Prey?

1597
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:03,994
Yeah. You see,
he's being hunted.

1598
01:53:04,168 --> 01:53:08,085
In a game that I construct
and orchestrate.

1599
01:53:08,259 --> 01:53:12,219
He... he agreed to participate.

1600
01:53:12,393 --> 01:53:14,918
To run for his life.

1601
01:53:15,092 --> 01:53:17,921
For all three of your lives.

1602
01:53:18,095 --> 01:53:19,618
Why?

1603
01:53:20,749 --> 01:53:23,665
Because I wanted him to.

1604
01:53:33,850 --> 01:53:35,939
You and your husband are alike.

1605
01:53:37,462 --> 01:53:40,247
You both think
you can fight back.

1606
01:54:38,610 --> 01:54:41,918
Changing up your look,
trying to stay warm...

1607
01:54:58,891 --> 01:55:02,851
Now, why would Dodge's
daddy's old car plant light up

1608
01:55:03,026 --> 01:55:06,029
like Chinese New Year?
Unless...

1609
01:55:07,552 --> 01:55:09,336
He's inviting us in.

1610
01:55:18,650 --> 01:55:19,999
All right, assholes.

1611
01:55:20,173 --> 01:55:21,566
Come and get me.

1612
01:55:47,592 --> 01:55:49,855
Well, howdy, Jeeves.

1613
01:55:50,029 --> 01:55:52,075
You got a slice of that chaw
for your old buddy Reagan?

1614
01:55:52,249 --> 01:55:53,641
No.

1615
01:55:58,472 --> 01:56:01,127
Good evening, Ms. Kennedy.

1616
01:56:01,301 --> 01:56:02,607
Lovely to see you again.

1617
01:56:02,781 --> 01:56:04,826
Nixon.

1618
01:56:05,001 --> 01:56:07,003
Reagan.

1619
01:56:07,177 --> 01:56:08,787
You bitches here to fight
for second place?

1620
01:56:10,658 --> 01:56:12,182
Oh, I assure you, my dear,

1621
01:56:12,356 --> 01:56:13,835
by the time I get done
here to...

1622
01:56:16,012 --> 01:56:17,013
Shit.

1623
01:56:34,204 --> 01:56:37,381
Let me tell you a story
about my Uncle Dutch.

1624
01:56:39,122 --> 01:56:41,820
He was gator huntin'.

1625
01:56:41,994 --> 01:56:44,518
He used to float dead rats
on top of beer cooler lids

1626
01:56:44,692 --> 01:56:46,216
with holes in 'em

1627
01:56:46,390 --> 01:56:49,741
so the-the scent would drip
down into the water.

1628
01:56:49,915 --> 01:56:52,787
One day, he was waiting
on one of them

1629
01:56:52,961 --> 01:56:56,487
big old dinosaurs
to pop his head up.

1630
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:00,099
What he didn't know was

1631
01:57:00,273 --> 01:57:04,234
this big old 15-footer

1632
01:57:04,408 --> 01:57:06,062
was coming up the bank
right behind him.

1633
01:57:13,112 --> 01:57:16,594
The moral of the story is:

1634
01:57:16,768 --> 01:57:19,901
I ain't got no Uncle Dutch
no more.

1635
01:57:27,996 --> 01:57:30,129
Look like I'm
Uncle Dutch now, huh?

1636
01:57:30,303 --> 01:57:31,478
Where's my wife?

1637
01:57:37,093 --> 01:57:38,790
Don't do nothin'
you can't live with.

1638
01:57:38,964 --> 01:57:40,096
Where is she?

1639
01:57:40,270 --> 01:57:42,881
I have no idea who your wife is,

1640
01:57:43,055 --> 01:57:44,622
let alone her whereabouts.

1641
01:57:44,796 --> 01:57:47,190
Hell, I barely know
who you are.

1642
01:58:25,967 --> 01:58:27,969
Dodge, are you okay?

1643
01:58:28,144 --> 01:58:29,362
You found me again.

1644
01:58:29,536 --> 01:58:30,711
Yeah, when I saw
the plant lit up,

1645
01:58:30,885 --> 01:58:32,409
I figured it was you
asking for help.

1646
01:58:32,583 --> 01:58:34,454
Help? You've been helping them
this entire time.

1647
01:58:34,628 --> 01:58:36,195
What?

1648
01:58:36,369 --> 01:58:38,197
You drugged me, didn't you?
So I'd get headaches.

1649
01:58:38,371 --> 01:58:41,461
Dodge, I wouldn't hurt you.
You're my best friend.

1650
01:58:41,635 --> 01:58:43,420
Yeah? Give me the gun, then.

1651
01:59:01,699 --> 01:59:05,268
Look, Dodge, whoever
told you I crossed you

1652
01:59:05,442 --> 01:59:06,878
is screwing with your head.

1653
01:59:07,052 --> 01:59:08,009
Now let's get the hell
out of here before...

1654
01:59:08,184 --> 01:59:09,533
-Ah!

1655
01:59:12,188 --> 01:59:13,885
Come on. Let's go.

1656
01:59:18,063 --> 01:59:19,456
All right, hold on.

1657
01:59:49,137 --> 01:59:51,009
I don't give a piss squirt
about your rules.

1658
01:59:51,183 --> 01:59:52,619
Send somebody now!

1659
01:59:52,793 --> 01:59:55,579
I cannot assist a hunter
once the game begins.

1660
01:59:55,753 --> 01:59:57,189
I'm bleeding out here!

1661
01:59:57,363 --> 01:59:58,843
Send somebody to come
and get me!

1662
02:00:00,932 --> 02:00:03,239
Ah, Miles!

1663
02:00:13,553 --> 02:00:15,729
Ah, Jesus, no!

1664
02:00:30,614 --> 02:00:33,573
Dodge.

1665
02:00:35,619 --> 02:00:38,796
All right. You're okay.

1666
02:00:38,970 --> 02:00:40,319
There you go. Take a seat.

1667
02:00:40,493 --> 02:00:42,016
Less than a minute,
cops and ambulances

1668
02:00:42,190 --> 02:00:43,322
are gonna be all over.

1669
02:00:43,496 --> 02:00:44,802
They'll get you to a hospital.

1670
02:00:46,499 --> 02:00:48,153
I'm really sorry.

1671
02:00:48,327 --> 02:00:49,328
I never should have believed
what they said about you.

1672
02:00:51,374 --> 02:00:52,766
All right, sit tight, buddy.

1673
02:00:52,940 --> 02:00:55,160
Where you going?

1674
02:00:55,334 --> 02:00:57,989
To end this game.

1675
02:01:06,563 --> 02:01:08,304
Where are they keeping her?

1676
02:01:10,523 --> 02:01:13,744
I hope you like irony.

1677
02:01:32,197 --> 02:01:33,590
Val.

1678
02:01:36,767 --> 02:01:38,203
-You okay?

1679
02:01:40,901 --> 02:01:41,946
-Come on.
-Oh, my God,

1680
02:01:42,120 --> 02:01:44,427
I thought you were dead.

1681
02:01:47,995 --> 02:01:50,650
Let's get you out of here, okay?

1682
02:01:57,962 --> 02:01:59,790
-Oh, shit.

1683
02:01:59,964 --> 02:02:01,835
All right, he only wants me.

1684
02:02:02,009 --> 02:02:03,271
I'm gonna lead him out that way
and you stay here.

1685
02:02:03,446 --> 02:02:05,491
-No. No!
-Just stay here. You'll be fine.

1686
02:02:05,665 --> 02:02:07,406
I love you.

1687
02:02:19,462 --> 02:02:22,073
It makes sense that
he married a woman like you.

1688
02:02:39,307 --> 02:02:41,005
I don't have a gun anymore.

1689
02:02:41,179 --> 02:02:42,485
You could only use a gun
'cause I was.

1690
02:02:42,659 --> 02:02:44,356
You shoot me,
you break the rules.

1691
02:03:28,356 --> 02:03:29,575
Come on, mate.

1692
02:03:31,272 --> 02:03:32,709
Take my hand.

1693
02:03:46,897 --> 02:03:49,682
It's sunrise.
The hunt's over.

1694
02:03:50,857 --> 02:03:53,556
Good show, Mr. Tynes.

1695
02:03:53,730 --> 02:03:55,906
Bloody good show.

1696
02:03:56,080 --> 02:03:57,603
Ma'am.

1697
02:04:07,308 --> 02:04:08,222
Oh...

1698
02:04:08,396 --> 02:04:09,876
It's over.

1699
02:04:10,050 --> 02:04:12,270
It's over.

1700
02:04:24,848 --> 02:04:26,023
Yeah?

1701
02:04:26,197 --> 02:04:28,416
Dodge, congratulations.

1702
02:04:28,591 --> 02:04:30,941
I knew you were a winner
when I met you.

1703
02:04:31,115 --> 02:04:34,988
Now I want you to enjoy
the rest of your life,

1704
02:04:35,162 --> 02:04:37,034
even though none of it
will be as exciting

1705
02:04:37,208 --> 02:04:38,949
as the day I just gave you.

1706
02:04:39,123 --> 02:04:42,126
You're welcome.

1707
02:05:05,976 --> 02:05:08,326
Our next runner, sir.

1708
02:05:12,765 --> 02:05:15,463
Oh, Eduardo.

1709
02:05:15,638 --> 02:05:18,815
You have no idea
what's in store for you.
