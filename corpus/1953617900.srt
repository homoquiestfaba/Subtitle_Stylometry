1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,277
They came from the far
corners of the world:

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,474
Europe, Australia, America.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,460
All drawn by the lure of
gold, discovered in the hills

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,713
of South Africa where big
game roamed in their thousands

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,039
and the wildest tales were true.

6
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,780
You get him, you get him champ!

7
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,757
Yes! Yes, you win!

8
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,510
Pull! Pull champ!

9
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,072
Into that world was
born a litter of puppies.

10
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,020
"Shorty you don't think you're gonna Shorty
you don't think you're gonna win do you?"

11
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,238
And one of these pups
stood out from the others,

12
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,200
not by size, because he was the
smallest, and not by beauty either,

13
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,436
because he was an odd
looking little fellow.

14
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,740
You're really silly.

15
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,070
He stood out because of his heart.

16
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,792
His was the biggest, the
bravest heart in all of Africa.

17
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,980
So young and you think
you've got all the answers!

18
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,596
If only life were that simple.

19
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,030
Before our time, man lived
in harmony with animals.

20
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,158
We could communicate and
understand one another.

21
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,940
But man wanted more; man

22
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,519
wanted control.

23
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,516
You animals will pay the price.

24
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,956
I was on my own for the first time,

25
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,549
and I was in no way prepared for an
adventure such as this. But I was lucky.

26
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,551
I had as my driver
and guide Jim Makokel.

27
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,060
Jim was a proud Zulu warrior.

28
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,833
Come On. It's for us.

29
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,000
Hey! Get away!
- It's him!

30
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,820
What do you mean? It's the
runt. We need the champion!

31
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,631
Don't look at the size! It's
what's in here... And here!

32
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,759
He was as brave and as
reckless as the day was long.

33
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,989
Jim's affection for the dog, puzzled me,

34
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,312
I didn't understand why because
he was the smallest of the litter.

35
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,600
The pup's mother shared a
special affnity with the

36
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,274
little fellow too.

37
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,238
What's a runt mom?

38
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,275
Oh, where did you hear that?

39
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,799
They were talking about me.

40
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,380
It just means you're small.

41
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,633
It's not how big you are on the
outside. It's how big you are in here.

42
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,140
Your father was the smallest. The
others teased him, called him the runt.

43
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,914
He became the bravest and best of all.

44
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,189
Just believe in yourself and
no one can make you feel small.

45
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,711
I'll try.

46
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,556
There's my big brave boy!

47
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,396
What is it?

48
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,356
You're going with Fitz and Jim.

49
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,229
What do you mean?

50
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,550
We talked about this. They're
leaving in the morning.

51
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,919
So I'm not going.

52
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,020
I don't want you to go,

53
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,032
but it's something we all have to do.

54
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,100
I left my mother and went with Baba,

55
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,320
now it's time for you to leave and
go with Fitz. It's all apart of life.

56
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,796
You just wanna get rid
of me cuz I'm small.

57
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,940
No! Baba chose you first overall
your brothers and sisters.

58
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,260
It's an honour. Pezulu is going too,

59
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,555
he'll watch out for you.

60
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,635
Yeah! I'll take care of you
little buddy. It'll be fun.

61
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,820
We'll see the world! Have
adventures! Get tattoos!

62
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,355
Pezulu!

63
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,830
Oh, you're in good hands
puppy. Well actually,

64
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,469
they're wings. Well they kinda look
more like claws, but don't worry;

65
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,599
they don't hurt. They're just feathers!

66
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,878
In fact I can't really pick anything up with them
at all, I usually have to use my feet to grab things...

67
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,590
and ah..well I er..uhoh,
what were we talking about?

68
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,660
Take care of him Pezulu. He
doesn't understand man yet.

69
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,400
Oh well now don't you
worry none. He'll be fine.

70
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,358
Fitz is a good man. Trying to
find his way in the world...

71
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,679
Clumsy as a three legged
warthog, but he means well.

72
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,399
He'll need you.

73
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,029
Come on, I'll introduce
ya. He's gonna love you.

74
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,032
I wanna stay with you.

75
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,475
I'll always love you, but it's
time for you to live your life.

76
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,275
Besides I'll see you in a few months

77
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,559
at Baba's kraal in the mountains.

78
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,991
Come.

79
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,275
Now don't you worry! You're
going to see all sorts

80
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,596
of new things, it's gonna be fun.

81
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,513
Hey, you like hens?

82
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,240
It's hard to imagine what it must
of felt like for that little pup.

83
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,020
He was being forced to trade everything
he loved for something completely unknown.

84
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,238
So you're taking the puppy?
- Yebo Baba

85
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,820
You have chosen well.

86
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,551
Baba has given you... the champion!

87
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,995
Thank you! Where is he?

88
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,391
This isn't the champion. It's the runt!

89
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,473
Awithandi. Baba sees it. I see it...

90
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,152
...and so will you.

91
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,391
Hey Pezulu! Look at me!

92
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,673
Hey! He's got the Puppy!
He's got the puppy! Puppy!

93
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,356
Ow! Hey!

94
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,239
Let me go!

95
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,911
I didn't see the point in chasing
after him. How could he survive?

96
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,820
Put me down!

97
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,460
They say that when an animal finds itself
in the clutches of a large predator...

98
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,980
they will give up and surrender.

99
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,480
I'm not scared of you!

100
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,911
Bully!

101
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,799
This little puppy was different.

102
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,955
He didn't understand the meaning of
surrender and he was not going to give up.

103
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,430
Mom? Mom? Mom?

104
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,700
Whats that in your mouth you
dirty scavenger? Well never,

105
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,996
where'd you come from?

106
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,076
What are we gonna do with this Snarly?

107
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,550
Won't survive out here.

108
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,075
Might as well put him
out of his misery now.

109
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,997
Leave me alone! Get off!

110
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,313
Now what are you gonna do?

111
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,640
Savage dog!

112
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,870
Mad Zulu, where'd he come from?

113
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,759
Ha. Well that is amazing. We've
been searching for him everywhere!

114
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,593
How'd you get away from that eagle?

115
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,310
You've been running
around looking for this?

116
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,597
Yes. I'm Fitz.

117
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,678
Good to meet you Fritz.
How about a cuppa?

118
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,720
It'll knock your socks off.

119
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,750
Ah no, thanks. You're a hunter?

120
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,900
What's the fuss over this little Mutt?

121
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,310
This little fellow just
escaped a Martial Eagle!

122
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,152
Yeah? Is he your dog.

123
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,900
Jim was right. There was something
special about this little dog.

124
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,389
And I knew that he was meant for me.

125
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,356
Yes, he's my dog.

126
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,995
What is his name?

127
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,470
Jock. Little Jock.

128
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,195
I like it!

129
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,710
Come on! Haven't got all day.

130
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,993
Get off!

131
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,594
Don't eat anything that's
been dead more than three days.

132
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,020
Don't even talk about a rhinoceros

133
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,600
unless you're close to a tree.

134
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,434
Come on Jock! Let's go!

135
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,353
Ah, it was to bad for Jock, that
his first taste of civilization

136
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,540
was Crooks' Corner. It was a wildplace,

137
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,191
a refuge for those running from the law.
But for Jock, it was just new and exciting.

138
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,836
It's called "Crooks
Corner" for a reason!

139
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,229
It's full of bad people.

140
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,540
I promised your mother puppy and now you
have to promise me you'll stay out of trouble.

141
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,677
Promise?
- Okay.

142
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,877
Promise?

143
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,940
Crooks Corner, Crocodile river,
I'm just saying these names mean

144
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,680
something, baaak! Promise?

145
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,429
Come on! Haven't got all day.

146
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,796
I promise. I'll stay out of trouble.

147
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,314
Come boy, come on!

148
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,710
Come Jock.

149
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,753
Get away! Argh!

150
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,235
Scared?

151
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,720
Are you okay, Jock?

152
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,920
Get off, ya mangy thing!
- Jock, Jock come back here!

153
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,100
Crooks Corner had the
only supply store en route

154
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,352
to the goldfields. It was
run by a greedy and ruthless

155
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,193
trader named Seedling.

156
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,434
Gosh!

157
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,519
Get away! Away!

158
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,596
Woah!

159
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,673
Huh? You'll get sick doing that.

160
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,271
The runt? Didn't think you'd survive.

161
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,380
You might wish you
hadn't. Come meet the boss.

162
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,440
George, the famous "fighting
baboon"of Crooks Corner.

163
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,560
George had toured with a
circus in his early years

164
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,999
and fought against dogs in wagered
battles. He never lost a fight.

165
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,554
That's better, keep up.

166
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,554
In all this time you get back
with a few skins and useless horns?

167
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,596
What are we gonna do with these?

168
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,480
Well I thought you may need them.

169
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,953
We need ivory! Alright?
This ain't a petshop.

170
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,700
What happened to you?

171
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,393
Get away from here!

172
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,435
Someone new in town George.

173
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,596
Hey hey! What are you doing with them?

174
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,673
None of your business, runt.

175
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,638
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size!

176
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,631
Careful Jock!

177
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,500
Hey wena, haisuga wena!

178
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,159
Hello, Fitzpatrick's the name...

179
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,950
My first encounter with Mr. Seedling
was neither warm or welcoming.

180
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,635
I..um..I brought this
crate up from the coast.

181
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,396
Ah yes, been expecting this.

182
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,279
I'd like a pan and shovel please...

183
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,394
...and a bag of salt.

184
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,274
You've got more chance
of HIM finding gold.

185
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,558
We're going to find gold boy.

186
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,400
Come see where we are going.

187
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,180
This is where I arrived
Jock, on a ship like this.

188
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,750
And that's where we met. Crooks'Corner.

189
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,952
This is Jim's Kraal,
where your mother lives.

190
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,220
We'll see her soon. And
this is where we're going.

191
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,516
Pilgrim's Rest, Gold by the ton!

192
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,592
That's where you are.

193
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,793
What's this?

194
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,198
Jock! He's my dog, cleverest
dog you'll ever meet!

195
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,920
Blow me down, it survived.

196
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,237
Well if he gets any bigger,

197
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,354
George can have a little sport.

198
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,318
Are you a missionary?

199
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,380
Not at all. I'm going to make my
fortune in gold. Pilgrims Rest!

200
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,980
The only way you'll find gold,

201
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,959
is if you pick it outta my teeth!

202
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,198
Stay close.

203
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,900
Ah, Miss Morris! How are you, luv?

204
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,560
Ewgh! I detest this place.

205
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,753
I've come for my books.
- They're here!

206
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,030
Excuse me?

207
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,429
I mean, in the crate, we brought...

208
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,239
Just arrived from the coast,

209
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,120
they'll be with you
on our next delivery!

210
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,439
Hey, I'm Jock.

211
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,396
Who do you think you are?
Scruffy little thing? Humph!

212
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,436
Hello.

213
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,591
Hey.

214
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,630
So you come here often?

215
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,396
Nice place.

216
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,437
Get out of my way. Hey there, Pol!

217
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,279
Do not call me that! My name
is Polly. Miss Polly to you.

218
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,940
How long you in town darl... er... Polly?

219
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,590
Get away you vile dog!
Get away! Come on Polly.

220
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,913
Off you go! Don't want you
mixing with these mongrels.

221
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,118
Stay away from her.

222
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,220
Tell me the odds, Seedling!

223
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,995
Ah, Mr. Morris. The favorite is yellow.

224
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:13,151
Yellow! Awful colour! I'll take blue!

225
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,636
We just arrived recently,
we're looking for gold.

226
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,120
Been here long?

227
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,740
About half a day and still after these
races we're going to have to be heading back.

228
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,592
I can't wait.

229
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,191
Hello Polly! Where have you been?

230
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,198
I suggest you place your bet,

231
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,820
and remove your dog.
- Father! Don't be rude.

232
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,100
This is Mr. Fitzpatrick.
He's here for the races.

233
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,740
Pleased to make your acquaintance sir...
- Mr. Morris.

234
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,319
I'd like to place this on blue please.

235
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,160
Break the bank?

236
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,357
I'm sorry, it's all I have.

237
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,140
Don't worry boy, we're
going to make a fortune.

238
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,958
Here's to blue!

239
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,119
Blue! Blue! Blue!

240
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,430
So you've seen this before,
Jim, it all looks like fun.

241
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,472
We'll prepare to leave in the morning.

242
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,755
Hello.

243
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,309
Pezulu, what's bothering you?

244
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,780
Everything. Everything
about this place bothers me.

245
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,980
Especially that baboon, you
know what he does don't you?

246
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,116
He fights dogs!

247
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,000
Hey George! Bet on me mate!

248
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,236
Keep an eye on things
here, I'll be right back.

249
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,275
Settle, George, settle!

250
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,869
There'll be champagne after this one.

251
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,597
Huh, what's he up to?

252
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,020
Whatever it is, it's got
nothing to do with us.

253
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,940
Stop worrying Pezulu, he's tied up!

254
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,340
Jock, I promised your mother...

255
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,795
This will be amazing!

256
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,500
Hello Lillian!
- Oh hello!

257
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,500
Camptown ladies sing this
song! Doo-da, Doo-da, Doo-da!

258
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,580
Camptown racetracks come
along! Oh, de doo-da day!

259
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,593
Come on, it'll soon be over.

260
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,740
Don't worry! Be Happy!

261
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,674
Now that's Basil, now he used to be in the
circus with George, he's an entertainer.

262
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,193
A little rearranging of the colours.

263
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,590
Fine.

264
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,380
Where's Wart?

265
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,550
What's he doing?

266
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,997
Let's make this a handicap race.

267
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,957
The thorn! Why did he do that?

268
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,114
That's the colour Fitz bet
on. He'll lose all his money.

269
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,432
What are you looking
at? Get away from here!

270
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,440
You look gorgeous, you look absolutely
gorgeous! Keep your colours on!

271
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,514
Keep your colours on! Get into
position, where the jockeys?

272
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,710
Look at them!

273
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,435
They race?

274
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,471
So!

275
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,340
He's a bad man.

276
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,700
Seedling makes money anyway he can.

277
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,120
Oh man, I can't wait!

278
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:15,111
No, no, this is where you stand.

279
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,835
Keep your tails up boys!

280
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,435
Ah! Don't you do this to me, Wart!

281
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,199
Wart, what is your problem?

282
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,269
I'll do it.

283
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,633
What? No! No. He can't
run. No, he can't!

284
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,916
No! No!

285
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,309
Who are you?

286
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,700
Do what?

287
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,631
Race.

288
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,260
Come here boy, ah, ah, listen,
hold on. Hold on! He won't run!

289
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,620
Let me do it, Basil.

290
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,711
The pig can't race.

291
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,837
Seedling stuck a thorn in his foot!

292
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,740
A thorn? How do you know?

293
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,620
Is it bad?

294
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,112
Oh no! Oh no, no, no,
no. You'll be fine.

295
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,110
Here. Bite on this.

296
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,032
How's that, hmm? Can you run?

297
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,557
Basil! I'll run.

298
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,469
You can't!

299
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,518
Ah, someone's coming, someone's coming!

300
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,594
Oh Jock! Oh, we're gonna
get in trouble now.

301
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,638
Come on, Basil.

302
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:22,180
Oh you... Here.

303
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,671
S'truth! OK you messy bunch, get ready!

304
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,075
Ah, the runt, someone
for you to beat Snarly.

305
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,517
Hmmm, thanks.

306
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,700
One of the singular things about

307
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,860
distant outposts of civilization is the way that
the people there adapt to the local environment.

308
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,397
There were few horses to be had
then, but warthogs were plentiful

309
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:54,190
so they developed this
new form of racing.

310
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,833
The residents of Crooks Corner
took this derby quite seriously.

311
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,913
Ah. The thrill of racing.

312
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,080
Yes, it's a little different.

313
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,180
This is Africa, Mr.
Fitzpatrick, nothing is normal!

314
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,714
Take your seats!

315
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,078
Oh, wait till your
mother hears about this!

316
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,314
Relax, will you, Pezulu?!

317
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,198
She's gonna put me in the chicken soup,

318
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,034
I don't know what she's gonna do with
me, what am I gonna do with myself?

319
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,591
And we're walking and we're
walking and we're stopping.

320
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,434
This is Julian.
- Hi!

321
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,037
Julian is your jockey.
You do not win. OK? OK?

322
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,434
Remember everybody: blue does not win.

323
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,756
He's got no chance.
No runt wins anything!

324
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,070
Yeah right.

325
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,870
OK you lot, wait for the gun...

326
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,479
Drop the stick, Julian, hold on tight.

327
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,879
Hold on. Okay?

328
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,870
Coming through!

329
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,634
What are you doing?

330
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,076
So long, sucker!

331
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,717
I don't see blue father
- What?

332
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,315
Oh wait, here he comes!

333
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,460
Ah! How's my pig doing?

334
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,516
It's a dog.

335
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,900
Eat my dust, Snarly!

336
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,036
I think it's your dog.

337
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,956
I don't think so

338
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,990
Here we go!
- Go Jock, Go! Go!

339
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,671
Go, you dog! Good show!

340
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,118
He'd have won if wasn't
for that pig without a..

341
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,600
Don't get hot and bothered.

342
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,798
A pig without a Jockey is disqualified.

343
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,910
Ha, ha, ha, ha! Look at you!

344
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,260
Oh no.

345
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,031
Excuse me, sir!

346
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,357
This is the champion!
This is the winner!

347
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,220
Well done!

348
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,118
You're number one!

349
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,080
How did he get involved?

350
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,620
Cut it out, Seedling, pay your debts.

351
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,100
Oh apologies, Mr. Morris, but this dog

352
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,315
was not registered.

353
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,910
Registered? Ha ha ha! Since when has
anything been registered in this place?

354
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,037
Mr. Seedling, the dog did not break
the rules and wore your colours.

355
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,355
Mr. Fitzpatrick and I will
receive our money graciously.

356
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,914
Well done my boy!

357
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,392
Jock. Stay with me, stay with me now.

358
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,710
Jock, come on, boy, come on!

359
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,360
Nice race huh?

360
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,750
What happened?

361
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,020
Wart couldn't even stand,

362
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,633
the dog just forced his way in.

363
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,198
Get that runt, then wait for me below.

364
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:45,020
Now don't stay too long on this island,
terrible place. And you be careful with Seedling.

365
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,793
Oh. Hello Seedling.

366
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,798
Oh Seedling, do not
forget Mr. Fitzpatrick.

367
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,160
Help me up! Let's go, Lillian.

368
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,716
Bye!

369
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,913
Goodbye!
- Bye.

370
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,159
Come on, boy. Thanks for this.

371
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,199
See you back at the camp, Jim!

372
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,620
Pssst. Jockie! Come and
join us, come on boy.

373
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,380
Race party! It's in the
cellar, chips and dips!

374
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,340
No. No we can't.
- Why not?

375
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,990
No. Because we gotta get out of here
before you get us into anymore trouble!

376
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,596
Come and join us, come on boy, the
winner has to be there, it's tradition.

377
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,830
Let's go.

378
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,874
What happened? It was your
job to stay at the baobab

379
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,992
and mind the animals.

380
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,554
How did that dog get in?

381
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,157
When I arrived at the tree,
the dog had the colours on,

382
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,340
Thought you did it!

383
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,592
How did that little mongrel do it?

384
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,877
Home sweet home.

385
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,874
Yes, Jockie, we have an underground
residence. It's an old mineshaft.

386
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:16,190
Brace yourself, it's partytime!

387
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,718
Ha ha! Look at them baby! Watch your step,
whoop whoop whoop whoop! Easy does it.

388
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,660
Now listen to this catchy song

389
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,512
my little chirpy canine chum.

390
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,593
They're pointing out
where you went wrong

391
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,700
and to join that race was dumb.

392
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,740
And worse than that
you had to go and win,

393
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,433
which was tactless and insane.

394
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,355
You so don't get the mess you're
in, as my chorus will explain.

395
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,114
You shouldn't have done it!

396
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,317
It was coming first that blew it!

397
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,951
And anyway it wasn't up to me.

398
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,955
Jockie, Jockie, Jockie, Jockie,
Jockie, George is going to throw a fit

399
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,180
I told ya, I warned ya,

400
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,860
You shouldn't have done it!

401
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,155
There was cheating going on.

402
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,820
You shouldn't have done it!

403
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,877
You shouldn't have run it!

404
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,952
You shouldn't have done it!
- Come on, Jockie.

405
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,620
If you have plans to grow up son,
which right now I would doubt.

406
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,759
You'll learn what is and isn't
done and that interfering's out.

407
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,435
You should have listened
to my sound advice,

408
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,157
When you're on this island paradise.

409
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,238
Oooh I think

410
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,471
you'd best disappear!

411
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,300
I told you, I warned you,

412
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,039
you shouldn't have done it!

413
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,036
You OK?

414
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,679
Wart thought he'd missed the party.

415
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,233
What have you done to him?

416
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,749
He fell down the stairs, you saw.

417
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,875
What happened today, Basil hmm?

418
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:04,952
A stray dog joins the race, and wins?

419
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,275
Who said you could run?

420
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,792
The warthog couldn't race.

421
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,838
You were in charge.

422
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,832
It was my idea. Leave him alone.

423
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,836
Stop! Please stop. No no no.

424
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,551
Come here, runt!

425
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,860
Bully.

426
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,440
What did you say!

427
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,440
I said bully.

428
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,354
Oh dear. Oh monkey.

429
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,993
George?
- Hey, I've got an idea.

430
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,996
The beam?

431
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,032
It was a great relief to
leave Crooks Corner behind us,

432
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,460
but to do so we had to
cross the Crocodile River.

433
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,918
I was terrified. Jim, however, was just
delighted to have another opportunity

434
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,635
to display his reckless courage.

435
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,357
Go on. Careful. Wait.

436
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,039
Basophalaphoi.

437
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,115
Be careful Jim!

438
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,980
Masambeni! Donsa!

439
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,834
Baba had once told me that
our actions were as stones

440
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,900
dropped in a pond.

441
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,118
They create ripples that travel
through others in ways we can't control.

442
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,114
That's why it's so important
to listen to our hearts

443
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:09,354
because he said, that's how the
spirit who Sees All talks to us.

444
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,396
This is the life, eh? Couple of
guys on the road, free as birds.

445
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,620
Well, I am anyway. You're
more like, free as a rock.

446
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,077
Ha ha! Why the long face?

447
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,600
Come on.

448
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,740
I shouldn't have done it.

449
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,958
Well you shouldn't have,
but you did. It's over now.

450
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,700
Bad luck to keep worrying
about the past. Time to move on.

451
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,916
How can I? When I made things worse.

452
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,580
Well you win some, you lose some.

453
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,700
You helped Fitz. But you
put Basil in Hot Water.

454
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,900
He'll survive, probably.

455
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,559
Besides, we're going
to go see your mother!

456
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,030
And I know a couple a hens there who'll
be glad to see me, I'll tell you that.

457
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,755
Fitz, the drums.

458
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,996
Hey, there she is! Hey, there she is!

459
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,140
I've missed you, mom.

460
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,039
Well you certainly didn't tell
me did ya, this one's trouble.

461
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,314
So I've heard.

462
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,274
What are the drums for?

463
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,794
The leopard has killed a
little girl from the village.

464
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,432
If it's got a taste for
humans it'll kill again.

465
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,110
Stay calm.

466
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,200
Time for a quiz.

467
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,000
Right. Who did this?

468
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,233
Anyone else think this is funny?

469
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,714
Who did this?

470
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,220
I didn't say anything.

471
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,471
Try again, Snarly.

472
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,915
Well you see, you were
about to tear the runt apart,

473
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:34,074
when this old beam just fell
and hit you! It was crazy!

474
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:41,620
Oh tragic. Right well that's it,

475
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,791
have a good evening.

476
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,029
So you couldn't race?

477
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,080
I don't see any further use for you.

478
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,110
Stop!

479
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:02,193
Now, where were we, Basil?

480
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,236
The beam fell on me and
you helped me off to bed?

481
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,114
The beam did this?

482
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,916
Oh dear.

483
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,397
I just wanted to help Fitz. He
was going to lose all his money.

484
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,912
So? That might have been just
the lesson he needed to learn.

485
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,420
Money is a human
matter, it's complicated.

486
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,320
Everyone makes mistakes. The
thing is to learn from them.

487
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,354
Here he comes!

488
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,700
What's going on?

489
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,189
What's going on? We're going
to hunt for the leopard!

490
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,980
We? Ha, this I gotta see.

491
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,993
Ow, my hip, oww, when did that happen?

492
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,039
Lead on, Pezulu

493
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,590
Oh, look at this place.

494
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,310
Gross.

495
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,460
Birds.
- Oh lucky dog,

496
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,550
someone up there likes you.

497
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,272
It's the voice of the ancestors,

498
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,671
a sign of change to come.

499
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,676
The little girl was bathing here.
It's the leopard's waterhole.

500
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,354
I hope he doesn't like chicken.

501
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,231
He could be watching us right now

502
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,555
Jock! Come boy. We're going in.

503
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,060
The leopard is out hunting.

504
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,594
Let's come back tomorrow.

505
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,795
We wait in the cave till he returns.

506
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:43,792
Really? In there? I don't know
if this is such a good idea.

507
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,199
Psst, Pezulu!
- Look at this!

508
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,914
Ohh, careful, careful!

509
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,877
Haibo wena! You'll kill
us before the leopard!

510
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,156
Baba?

511
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,679
No. These are thousands of years old.

512
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,193
So no new ones?

513
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,476
Jock!

514
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,349
Stay close boy.

515
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,471
Okay.

516
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,475
He won't come back. He knows we're here.

517
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,270
What was that?

518
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,715
We should stay!

519
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,430
Wow!

520
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,349
Wait here.

521
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,636
Mo-om!

522
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,511
Jock!

523
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,190
Leave her alone!

524
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,516
Stay there, mom!

525
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,630
Don't! Don't shoot!

526
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,237
Mom?

527
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,540
Jess? Oh no. Jess!

528
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,789
He's gone.

529
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,195
I'm here.

530
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,432
It's always said that dogs don't
"feel" things, not the way humans do.

531
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:50,480
Anyone who had seen Jock's sad eyes

532
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,873
would never say that.
His heart was broken.

533
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:09,159
Poor Jess. Oh Jock, I'm so sorry.

534
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:24,712
I'm so proud of you.

535
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,117
It's all my fault.

536
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,592
No, you...

537
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,071
you did everything you could.

538
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,913
You bear no blame.

539
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,556
Don't die. I need you.

540
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:53,879
You'll do fine. You're like your father.

541
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,910
Fighting for what you believe in.

542
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:08,717
I love you, I'll always be with you.

543
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:20,700
We travelled for months and
finally we were here, Pilgrims Rest.

544
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,871
The town I had dreamed of.

545
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,191
It had been 10 years since
the big strikes were made here,

546
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,033
but I was sure there was still
gold coming out of those hills,

547
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,232
and I aimed to find it.

548
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,317
Here we are.

549
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,713
See you at the wagon park, Jim!

550
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,120
I'll bring back pots of
gold boy! See you later.

551
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,940
Jock. You OK, son?

552
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,397
Sure, I'm just going
to keep an eye on Fitz.

553
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,670
Basopha! Basopha! Watch out!

554
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,156
Hello there!

555
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,354
I was blinded by my enthusiasm,

556
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,116
I didn't see how bleak things were,
I didn't see that it was too late.

557
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:07,874
Every piece of ground in the valley had
been claimed. Newcomers were not welcome.

558
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:19,877
Hey!

559
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,477
What are you doing?

560
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,630
I'm sorry.

561
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,156
All the claims are taken. Move off.

562
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,038
Years of dreaming, months of journeying,

563
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:44,558
my life's savings...
gone. I had nothing.

564
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,879
And I didn't know what to do.

565
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,831
I think we're too late Jock.
All this way for nothing.

566
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,190
This is all I've got left. And
I've only got this because of you.

567
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,037
No. Not now.

568
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:04,678
Hey, come on! No! No!
Not now! Jock, stop it!

569
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,033
Stop it! Hey! Come on!

570
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,834
Mr. Fitzpatrick?

571
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,834
How nice to see you!

572
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,438
Well? Looks like you're
enjoying yourself.

573
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,796
Any luck, Mr. Fitzpatrick?
- No.

574
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,140
Hard work, that's the ticket, my boy!

575
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,312
Oh we're not afraid of that,
Sir. It seems we are a bit late,

576
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,393
all the claims were taken. They
say Barberton is where the gold is!

577
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,718
I wish you luck.

578
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,460
Why don't you join us for tea?

579
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,550
Lillian!

580
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,020
Morning, morning. Oh George!

581
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:49,594
I preach the good news! Our
little dog has killed a leopard!

582
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:54,278
He's a local hero!

583
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,753
Well even you're afraid
of leopards, George...

584
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,829
Oh I am going to setup some fight!

585
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,151
Happy days are here again,

586
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,710
Leopard must have choked on him.

587
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,150
Food.

588
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,637
Jess died. Jock's an
inspiration to me though.

589
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,714
He's so clever and afraid of
nothing. He's taught me so much.

590
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,872
I couldn't have asked for a better dog.

591
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,874
Stay inside, Polly.

592
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,514
Let her go, father

593
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,996
Hey Polly.

594
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,718
Hello Jock. Are you hungry?

595
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:05,820
What? No, no I... I, I thought
I saw a cat in the alley.

596
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,260
I must have got a bit clumsy.

597
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,860
Oh...
- Yeah.

598
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:14,352
Oh why don't you come in? You
couldn't look clumsy if you tried.

599
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,591
Entre.

600
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:24,155
Jock I heard about your
mother, I'm so sorry.

601
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:28,917
Thanks. She was so brave.
She died because of me.

602
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:30,915
Oh, Jock.

603
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,916
I can't get used to her being gone.

604
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,276
Come in.

605
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:42,157
Healthy appetite, Mr. Fitzpatrick.

606
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,434
Is that the Brittanica? The full set?

607
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,180
Um... Yes.

608
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,351
So tell me, Mr. Fitzpatrick,
what are your plans?

609
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,800
I er..Um, I'm going to look
around for opportunities, sir.

610
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,189
Have you a wagon?

611
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,356
Yes sir.

612
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:00,355
Good. Start with what you've
got! Lillian has a piano.

613
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,594
Seedling's been saying for
weeks he's going to deliver it.

614
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,832
But, um, if you are up to it?

615
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,193
You can count on me, Sir!

616
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,429
If you get it here in mint condition,

617
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,751
I'll assist you in getting started.

618
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,100
Started with what father?

619
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,873
Transport riding!

620
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:26,070
Jock! Right! We've got a job to do boy!

621
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,673
No no, Jock. Not yet!

622
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,159
Save those for your
trip, I'll feed the dog.

623
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,631
Oh watch out for the rocks, George.

624
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,076
Oh George.

625
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,080
There's a healing power in Africa,

626
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,073
one that defies wealth.

627
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,078
It's a power that feeds the soul.

628
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,118
And through that power I realised

629
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,835
that I had found a richness
of a different kind.

630
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,550
I had found an incredibly
brave and loyal friend.

631
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,152
Hey, man's here with that dog.

632
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,640
Man's here with that dog. Says
he's coming to fetch the piano.

633
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,700
Oh George I can't stand
these hessian bags,

634
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,474
they drive my allergies
crazy, please, oh George.

635
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,194
Hello me lovelies.

636
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,380
You were doing so well till you

637
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,950
started taking orders
from the wrong guy.

638
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:07,272
Please, George, I'll
do anything for you,

639
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,278
remember the old days on the stage.

640
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:14,073
How about a song before you go.

641
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,637
Wind it up, Basil.

642
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,020
On the surface we may seem
an unlikely combination

643
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,520
but I see us

644
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,195
as a team, mutual appreciation

645
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,875
I can see beyond

646
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:37,660
the rough and ready outer you,

647
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,071
know my words are true, so hang

648
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:47,237
around and listen for a while, I'm
sure I'll raise a glimmer of a smile.

649
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:53,060
Well I woke up this morning
had some real bad news,

650
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:56,551
well I woke up this morning
had some real bad news,

651
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:02,114
there was darkness all around
me, I had the hessian blues.

652
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,477
Tickle them ivories, Georgie baby

653
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:10,876
There was darkness all around
me, I so had those hessian blues.

654
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:16,071
Well I woke up this
morning, all I saw was black,

655
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,640
and the man done told me

656
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,956
You've been sleeping in a sack

657
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,470
and the man done told me that I have

658
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,237
been sleeping in a sack!

659
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,700
Hessian is so 1873,

660
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:39,430
but I seen the light,
I'm singing what I choose,

661
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:43,310
yeah I seen the light,
I got nothin' to lose,

662
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,949
I'm as happy as a sad boy,

663
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,351
don't use those hessian blues.

664
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,552
Take it away, Georgie,
tickle those ivories!

665
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:58,994
I'm as happy as a sad boy,
don't use those hessian blues.

666
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,958
So hang around and listen for a while,

667
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:10,238
I'm sure I'll raise
a glimmer of a smile.

668
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,393
Basil! Basil!

669
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,274
I'd hate to lose you,

670
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,717
and your good voice. Just remember,

671
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,193
you only take orders from me!

672
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,271
We're here to collect
the piano for Mr. Morris.

673
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:43,540
I've already loaded the piano.

674
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:46,075
The letter confirms cancelation of this.

675
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:51,670
Why don't you and your dog come inside?

676
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,600
I'm afraid we're in a hurry.

677
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,752
Take the piano off!

678
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,795
George! George!

679
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,830
Come on down here now! Get down here.

680
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,992
Gently, gently, put it, yes,

681
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,780
Come on, lift higher.

682
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,280
Careful with that! Easy!

683
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,192
What are you doing up
there? Get back inside!

684
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,876
We have a score to settle.

685
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,594
Go get him, George

686
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:51,835
Get back here, Jock!

687
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,240
Come boy!

688
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,060
Crikey!

689
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:03,359
Crack of dawn we leave for

690
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:07,740
Pilgrims Rest. I'm about
to lose a big client.

691
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:13,757
You bring the wagon, I'll ride
ahead. And George is coming.

692
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:24,315
Now careful, careful. We don't
want Polly's piano broken.

693
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,320
There you are, perfect order.
- Oh ho wonderful!

694
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,790
Well let's see if it's still in tune.

695
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,998
Ah! Good heavens!
- Ah! Hey hey, Basil!

696
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,060
What else is in there?

697
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:41,460
My apologies Sir! It's the
monkey from Crooks Corner.

698
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:43,233
Oh poor little lamb.

699
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,196
Calm down, Basil, what's wrong?

700
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,395
George was about to feed
me to the crocodiles.

701
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,300
Because of me?
- Yes. I wish I'd never met you.

702
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,676
Sorry. I didn't want
you to get into trouble.

703
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,718
What have you done to him?
- Nothing!

704
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,156
Come inside, Basil. Come on, this way.

705
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,837
I say Lillian! Are we
keeping this monkey?

706
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,592
Give him a banana, father!

707
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,951
Is it good?

708
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,276
Who could that be?

709
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,999
What in God's name are you doing here?

710
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:39,351
I..er.. I need to talk to you, Sir.

711
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,740
It's Seedling!

712
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,300
What's the flower for?

713
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,800
Well sorry to trouble you, luv.

714
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,235
Oh please, here a... accept my flower?

715
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,479
Um... Come in.

716
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,980
I get you some tea.

717
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,116
Argh. Time for a walk.

718
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:04,957
Sir, sir, I need a moment
please. Well the piano...

719
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,500
You see I thought I did
all of your deliveries?

720
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,831
I'm giving this young fellow
a chance to prove himself.

721
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,639
Wo, hey, take it easy.

722
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,580
Ah, where's that brave dog of yours?

723
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,717
Jock, Jock, come back.

724
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,839
Ah, there you are.

725
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:34,020
Come on take it. Take it.

726
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,394
He'll only accept food from me.

727
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:39,318
Ah... Well trained.

728
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,700
Anyway it's wonderful to see you folk...

729
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:46,953
I have a proposition for you.

730
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,260
For who?

731
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:53,514
Oh Mr. Fitzpatrick. Your dog
has become the talk of the town.

732
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,340
I'd like to give him another
chance of proving himself.

733
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:01,559
Jock has nothing to prove, he won't
participate in any more of your races.

734
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,753
It's not the races, Mr. Fitzpatrick.

735
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,159
It's a challenge.

736
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:11,071
I mean your dog is itching for a fight.

737
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,554
Now ask yourself why he raced.

738
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:20,270
I meanm why he challenged
George? Bold as brass.

739
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:21,357
No

740
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,660
Well he's fedup with
being the runt, that's why.

741
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:27,469
He wants recognition.

742
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,820
And it seems you want it too.
- Well no!

743
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:34,799
Oh, yeah, the whole
town's heard your stories.

744
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,795
He killed the man eating leopard!

745
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:42,060
Well looks like you've set
the challenge, Mr. Fitzpatrick.

746
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,940
Me? I did nothing of the sort!

747
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:49,955
Well if the challenge
is too big, maybe the

748
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:55,952
dog's too small and your
stories are too tall?

749
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,953
I think it's time you left.

750
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,111
Which is it, Mr. Fitzpatrick?

751
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,200
Will you stop that!?

752
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,796
Oh dear, that's a bad sign.

753
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,075
Relax, Basil.

754
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,310
Tell me again why we're
walking through the graveyard?

755
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:41,078
Is this your idea of how to calm
me down? Because it's not working!

756
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:44,900
You'll be safer out
here with Jim and Pezulu.

757
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:46,752
You're not gonna fight, are you?

758
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,389
Of course not, that
wouldn't solve anything.

759
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,540
Good. Because George is crazy.
He wasn't always that way,

760
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:55,180
but Seedling tied him up, beat him,

761
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,460
made him fight, it drove him mad!

762
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,597
Well there you are, lover boy!

763
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,110
How is she?

764
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,900
She's fine. -
Fine? - Yeah.

765
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,180
I don't wanna know about
fine, I want details! Details!

766
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:11,900
You know, what was she wearing?
Was she wearing perfume?

767
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,639
Was she wearing a collar?

768
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:18,033
Did she look at ya? Was she speaking
French? You know a little vous le vous?

769
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,520
What was that?

770
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:28,400
I hear that too.

771
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,180
Jim!

772
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:37,872
George?

773
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,712
Good evening, Basil.

774
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:50,540
Still taking orders from the wrong guy?

775
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:51,471
Which guy?

776
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:57,830
Let him go!

777
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:00,900
Run, Basil!

778
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,195
Oh no! Bad thing!

779
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,075
Stop it!
- I should finish you off!

780
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,470
Hey!

781
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,260
Oooh. What are you going
to do with that, Basil?

782
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,760
Leave him alone!!

783
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:17,319
Leave him alone! Stop
fooling around, George!

784
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,272
Time for your challenge,

785
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:24,780
Come on.

786
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,360
In you go. Come on! Go on, in!

787
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,796
Ah, get in there dog. Go on. Move, move!

788
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,758
Good dog.

789
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,714
Oh no!

790
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:50,317
Jim?

791
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,192
They've taken Jock.

792
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:59,832
Who could that be?

793
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,940
It's very late. At this hour, hmm?

794
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,394
Sorry to trouble you.
- What is it?

795
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:06,359
Seedling's taken Jock.
They've burnt my wagon.

796
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,359
Father, get the cart.

797
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:11,520
Don't worry, Polly. We'll find him.

798
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:20,078
People! People! This is the final
call, we gotta have an early start.

799
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:25,110
Are there any more bets out
there for the leopard slayer?

800
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:38,231
Haven't been much help
to your Fitzy, have you?

801
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:43,433
All you had to do was
stay out of our business.

802
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:48,359
Bad dog! Don't let me down tomorrow,

803
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,397
I want a good fight.

804
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,872
You stay with me.

805
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,351
Aah! Hey I can walk you know!

806
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,029
What is this? Buddy up?

807
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,429
Get away from here!

808
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,954
I've caused enough trouble.

809
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,154
Julian! Get away! Quick!

810
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:27,392
Time for business George.

811
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:38,951
Yes. What a beautiful day!

812
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:45,750
George!

813
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,037
Hup hup, come on!

814
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:50,431
Hiyah!

815
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,100
Where is he?

816
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,260
Who?

817
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,999
The little coward has run away!

818
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,154
He won't miss the fight.

819
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,472
You better hope not.

820
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:18,751
I need a curtain raiser. Your dog.

821
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:23,756
Seedling please! He stands no chance.

822
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,560
Find our challenger, and your dog lives.

823
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,392
Wind it up, Basil.

824
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:44,560
People people! Please please
please! May I have your attention.

825
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:49,514
If you'll be patient, we'll
have a little entertainment

826
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,460
before the main event.

827
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:54,120
George may be a little rusty,

828
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:57,597
it's been a while
since his last fight...

829
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:01,260
Treat this as a warm up!

830
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,272
That's not a warm up, that's Snarly!

831
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,433
Basil loved these.

832
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:25,310
No thanks.

833
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:29,191
Seedling's making Snarly fight
George. He's got no chance.

834
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,716
Baba?

835
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:39,100
You are free, now it is time to choose.

836
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:42,340
How can I? Everything
I've done has gone wrong.

837
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:44,900
I lost my mother, made
everyone here suffer.

838
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:48,072
Fitz lost everything because
of me. And now Snarly...

839
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:52,540
Mistakes are the price
we pay for knowledge.

840
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:54,180
I can not beat him, Baba.

841
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:57,557
It is time. Your mother is with you.

842
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:07,511
Well here he is, folks,
all the way from Australia,

843
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:11,158
Snapping Snarly!

844
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,720
Where is the leopard slayer?

845
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:17,558
Jock! Come on, where are ya!

846
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:21,511
Jock!

847
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:47,392
With teeth larger than
a lions, weighing in

848
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:52,994
at 9 stone, our one, our only George!

849
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,956
Let's hear it, folks, come on!

850
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:18,590
Jock!

851
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:22,199
The Leopard Slayer!

852
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:25,594
All right, folks, this is it, come on!

853
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,438
I love a fight in the morning.

854
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:47,469
Hey! Runt! I have a
little surprise for you.

855
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,831
Recognize this?

856
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:56,590
I think it killed your mother?

857
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,660
Ladies and Gentlemen,

858
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:04,960
I present the leopard slayer!

859
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,998
Go, Jock!

860
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,357
Gimme a fight runt!

861
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,109
That's it, Jock!

862
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,749
On me toes, on me toes! Yeah!

863
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:23,755
Don't be scared, come
on, I'll make it quick!

864
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:37,312
We don't have to do this,
George. We don't have to fight.

865
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:40,916
That's it, Jock!

866
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,474
I'm not your enemy!

867
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,238
Yes, you are!

868
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:50,140
I'm not the one who
chained you up, beat you

869
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,435
and made you fight!

870
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:56,309
Don't let him make a
monkey out of you, Jock!

871
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,434
Who's the monkey?

872
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,589
You're the one taking
orders from the wrong guy.

873
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,637
What are you? A weakling??

874
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:18,231
You're free. Now it's
your time to choose.

875
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,916
Get him, George! Come on!

876
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:30,236
What are you doing, George?
Come on, you worthless ape!

877
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,554
It's up to you.

878
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:45,757
See ya later, Seedling! Get outta town!

879
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,591
Get him, George!
- Let's see him off, Basil!

880
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:51,396
Come back!

881
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,833
George, listen!

882
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,238
Hold on, Basil, I'm coming!

883
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:22,280
We made it, George.

884
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,390
George?

885
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,952
George, come on, my friend.

886
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,879
Come on my friend, ah!
- Stay there, Basil!

887
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:34,836
Stay where you are!

888
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:41,197
Enjoy your swim.

889
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,060
Jock!

890
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,150
Oh boy.

891
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,712
Help me.
- Oh come on down, Basil.

892
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:49,070
Keep coming, keep coming! Basil!

893
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,880
Don't panic.
- Jock!

894
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,838
Hold on, Basil!
- Careful, Basil!

895
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:57,637
Jock!

896
01:12:58,120 --> 01:12:59,713
Hold on! I'll help you!
- Help, help!

897
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:01,519
Jock! Be careful! Jock!

898
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:04,276
I'll get ya. Hold on!

899
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:06,077
Ok there, shoot!

900
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:08,557
Again!

901
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,716
Swim Jock! Swim!

902
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:13,030
Hold on, Basil!

903
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:19,220
I'm holding on, I'm holding
on. Ah! Is that necessary?

904
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:21,311
Yes! Jock is our hero!

905
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,220
There goes George. I
hope he'll be alright.

906
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:31,357
At least he's free
to decide for himself.

907
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,910
We all can, thanks to you, Jock.

908
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:37,833
Come on, your fans are
waiting, take a bow.

909
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,874
...Did you see him? He was
amazing, did you see him?

910
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:47,020
Oh, mon dieu, quel courage, quel
courage!
C' es tun chien axtraordinaire!

911
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,953
Can't believe it. Can't believe it.

912
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:02,740
Make way, make way! Here comes the hero.

913
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,420
Get outta the way here,
watch your feet there!

914
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,114
Well done, Jock! Good dog.

915
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:11,833
Well done, Jock. Well done,
boy! We're so proud of you!

916
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:18,470
Oh! Jock!

917
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,279
Go and see him, Polly!

918
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:25,718
Hamba Kahle.

919
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:43,500
Bravo, Jock. Se ete extraordinnaire.

920
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:44,476
Thanks

921
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:51,397
Ahhh, that's nice.
That's, that's my boy.

922
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:55,515
Hey Polly! Got a sister?

923
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:00,274
Look at them, a fine pair.

924
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:07,340
I learned a lot over that
journey. I learned that the things

925
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:10,080
we want are not necessarily
the things we need.

926
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,714
And I learned to value friendship,
love, devotion and above all else,

927
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:18,995
I learned the importance of courage,

928
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:22,830
to stand up for what is right,
and to never, ever give up.

929
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:27,380
I was different when it
came to an end. I was a man.

930
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:29,710
And I owed it all

931
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,435
to a brave little dog named Jock.
