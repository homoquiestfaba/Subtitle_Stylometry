01:08:37,828 --> 01:08:40,048
The way to get
into heaven after

733
01:08:40,091 --> 01:08:41,701
is to repent now.

734
01:08:44,094 --> 01:08:46,141
You don't want to be
standing at the gates of hell

735
01:08:46,183 --> 01:08:49,187
wishing you had just said
your penance, do you?

736
01:08:49,231 --> 01:08:50,972
No.

737
01:08:51,015 --> 01:08:52,321
Well...

738
01:08:52,365 --> 01:08:54,235
then...

739
01:08:55,455 --> 01:08:57,544
you owe God 40 Hail Marys.

740
01:09:01,069 --> 01:09:03,071
[gun cocks, gunshot]

741
01:09:07,293 --> 01:09:11,209
[Emma mutters prayer]

742
01:09:11,253 --> 01:09:14,125
...blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

743
01:09:14,169 --> 01:09:17,477
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

744
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,433
[gasps]

745
01:09:19,609 --> 01:09:22,263
Hey, I lost a tooth today.

746
01:09:22,307 --> 01:09:23,874
Oh, you're growing up.

747
01:09:23,918 --> 01:09:25,963
No doubt about it.

748
01:09:26,007 --> 01:09:27,790
Should we celebrate
with the Tooth Fairy?

749
01:09:27,834 --> 01:09:32,012
How about we celebrate
with my special grilled cheese?

750
01:09:32,056 --> 01:09:33,275
Take this to the boys.

751
01:09:33,319 --> 01:09:34,668
[gunshot sound effect]

752
01:09:41,109 --> 01:09:42,240
Dinner's ready.

753
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:44,982
[gunshot sound effect]

754
01:09:47,289 --> 01:09:49,246
Look, I lost a tooth today.

755
01:09:49,290 --> 01:09:51,423
Wow. Radical.

756
01:09:51,467 --> 01:09:53,164
Move! You're blocking
the target.

757
01:10:00,607 --> 01:10:03,349
- Comin' around that tree.
- Yeah, I see.

758
01:10:03,392 --> 01:10:04,914
- [gunshot]
- Twitch him.

759
01:10:09,529 --> 01:10:11,530
Turn that thing off.
We're praying.

760
01:10:11,574 --> 01:10:13,184
[gunshot]

761
01:10:14,142 --> 01:10:18,450
- [gunshots continue]
- [zombies hissing]

762
01:10:18,494 --> 01:10:20,801
Turn that off.

763
01:10:20,843 --> 01:10:22,498
And wait until the "amen."

764
01:10:22,542 --> 01:10:23,977
[sighs]

765
01:10:27,285 --> 01:10:28,461
Dear Lord...

766
01:10:30,158 --> 01:10:33,204
help us to ward off the devil,
for he is real.

767
01:10:34,902 --> 01:10:36,599
And show us your face, Lord...

768
01:10:38,427 --> 01:10:41,125
for we will not forget it
once we have seen it.

769
01:10:42,691 --> 01:10:44,477
- Amen.
- Amen.

770
01:10:52,659 --> 01:10:53,789
Not too bad.

771
01:10:55,357 --> 01:10:56,445
83 hits.

772
01:10:57,490 --> 01:10:59,012
27 kills.

773
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:37,355
Dear God,

774
01:11:37,399 --> 01:11:41,751
please save my soul
from going into hell.

775
01:11:41,795 --> 01:11:44,057
Help my mom find me.

776
01:11:46,190 --> 01:11:48,279
And...

777
01:11:48,323 --> 01:11:51,413
tell the fairy
to come get my tooth.

778
01:11:53,023 --> 01:11:53,937
Amen.

779
01:12:17,918 --> 01:12:19,615
[yawns]

780
01:12:43,117 --> 01:12:45,727
Here we go.

781
01:12:45,771 --> 01:12:46,860
Cha cha cha.

782
01:12:47,991 --> 01:12:49,905
How you guys doing?

783
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:51,473
How you doing at home?

784
01:12:51,517 --> 01:12:53,431
One...

785
01:12:53,475 --> 01:12:56,217
Now we're gonna take the
swivel side, and cross over.

786
01:12:58,045 --> 01:12:58,914
Five.

787
01:13:03,093 --> 01:13:05,792
One more time,
let's do these side crosses.

788
01:13:05,834 --> 01:13:07,663
Back to mambo.

789
01:13:07,707 --> 01:13:09,578
Front, cha cha cha.

790
01:13:09,622 --> 01:13:12,059
Back. Front.

791
01:13:13,539 --> 01:13:14,801
Cross it over.

792
01:13:17,543 --> 01:13:19,501
Now let's cut that in half.

793
01:13:19,545 --> 01:13:21,155
Two mambos.

794
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:24,898
Cross over.

795
01:13:26,987 --> 01:13:28,989
March in place.

796
01:13:29,032 --> 01:13:31,468
Now we're gonna change it
again. Walk forward.

797
01:13:31,512 --> 01:13:34,472
Forward shimmy.
Here we go.

798
01:13:34,516 --> 01:13:36,649
Looking good right there.

799
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:40,173
You go back.

800
01:13:41,871 --> 01:13:44,134
Add your hair, your flavor.

801
01:13:44,178 --> 01:13:46,048
Are we doing communion?

802
01:13:47,355 --> 01:13:49,530
Put that all together.

803
01:13:49,575 --> 01:13:51,054
The world is shit.

804
01:13:51,098 --> 01:13:52,360
Five, from the mambo.

805
01:13:53,491 --> 01:13:54,884
Cha cha cha.

806
01:13:54,928 --> 01:13:56,016
It's better
you know that now

807
01:13:56,059 --> 01:13:57,931
than to have
to find out later.

808
01:13:57,974 --> 01:13:59,367
Forward.

809
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:03,806
Shimmy.

810
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:04,938
Going back.

811
01:14:09,464 --> 01:14:11,118
Now we're gonna march
in place.

812
01:14:11,161 --> 01:14:15,252
[children]
I pledge allegiance to the flag

813
01:14:15,296 --> 01:14:18,429
of the United States
of America,

814
01:14:18,473 --> 01:14:22,738
and to the republic
for which it stands,

815
01:14:22,782 --> 01:14:27,134
one nation, under God,
indivisible,

816
01:14:27,177 --> 01:14:29,702
with liberty and justice
for all.

817
01:14:32,052 --> 01:14:33,967
[Emma]
I wonder how rocks are made.

818
01:14:37,666 --> 01:14:39,755
Maybe they're made
from, like, boulders.

819
01:14:39,798 --> 01:14:41,365
Or, like,
statues or something.

820
01:14:43,584 --> 01:14:47,894
[Jabril] Are you saying
that rocks make statues?

821
01:14:47,937 --> 01:14:49,983
[Emma] I'm saying that
statues make rocks.

822
01:14:54,074 --> 01:14:55,162
[Jabril] Maybe.

823
01:15:07,609 --> 01:15:09,610
This is my mom's house.

824
01:15:11,569 --> 01:15:12,700
Uh...

825
01:15:26,019 --> 01:15:28,499
[screen door creaks]

826
01:15:28,543 --> 01:15:30,806
[locked doorknob rattling]

827
01:15:46,691 --> 01:15:48,041
Boost me up.

828
01:15:48,084 --> 01:15:49,912
I'm going in.

829
01:15:49,956 --> 01:15:51,087
[Jabril grunts]

830
01:16:00,444 --> 01:16:05,145
Where the fuck were you?

831
01:16:05,188 --> 01:16:06,886
I almost called the police.

832
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:08,365
[Rick] What?

833
01:16:08,409 --> 01:16:10,541
- [Emma] Hi...
- I didn't know what to do.

834
01:16:10,584 --> 01:16:11,760
What are you, brain dead?

835
01:16:11,804 --> 01:16:13,588
Don't you ever go there.

836
01:16:16,896 --> 01:16:18,767
Are you sure
that you're okay, Emma?

837
01:16:18,811 --> 01:16:21,074
Yeah, we went to a garage sale.
Look what I got.

838
01:16:21,117 --> 01:16:22,815
[cat mews]

839
01:16:22,858 --> 01:16:25,774
She wanted to go for a ride,
I took her for a ride.

840
01:16:25,818 --> 01:16:28,385
You were gone for four hours.

841
01:16:28,429 --> 01:16:31,780
You cannot even begin
to imagine the shit

842
01:16:31,824 --> 01:16:34,173
that has been going
through my head.

843
01:16:38,047 --> 01:16:40,354
What is with the cat?

844
01:16:40,396 --> 01:16:42,051
It's a kitten.

845
01:16:42,095 --> 01:16:43,270
"It's a kitten."

846
01:16:45,185 --> 01:16:46,882
[Emma] Isn't he cute?
I'm naming him Ace.

847
01:16:50,843 --> 01:16:53,106
How could you take her
without telling me?

848
01:16:53,149 --> 01:16:54,890
You were sleeping.
She's fine.

849
01:16:56,587 --> 01:16:58,154
Emma, you thirsty?

850
01:16:58,198 --> 01:16:59,677
Yep. So's Ace.

851
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:09,383
- [starting to cry]
- [Rick] Don't worry about her.

852
01:17:10,384 --> 01:17:11,559
[door thuds closed]

853
01:17:15,345 --> 01:17:18,000
[Rick and Jessie
talking indistinctly]

854
01:17:18,044 --> 01:17:21,221
[Jessie] I need you to
swear on your mother or God

855
01:17:21,264 --> 01:17:22,265
or whatever you swear on...

856
01:17:22,309 --> 01:17:23,396
your bike, for fuck's sake...

857
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:24,702
that you didn't touch her.

858
01:17:24,746 --> 01:17:26,617
[Rick] You are sick.

859
01:17:26,661 --> 01:17:28,054
You're sick in the head,
you know that?

860
01:17:29,968 --> 01:17:32,798
[Jessie] I don't understand.
I don't understand.

861
01:17:32,841 --> 01:17:35,843
I don't understand why
you were gone for four hours.

862
01:17:35,887 --> 01:17:37,628
I just... I just...
I don't understand.

863
01:17:37,672 --> 01:17:39,065
That's all, shit.
[crying]

864
01:17:39,108 --> 01:17:41,458
Jessie. Jessie.

865
01:17:42,982 --> 01:17:44,679
Shut your fucking mouth.

866
01:17:46,289 --> 01:17:47,813
I'm not gonna say it again.

867
01:17:47,856 --> 01:17:49,378
[Jessie] I'm not trying
to make you mad.

868
01:17:49,423 --> 01:17:50,859
I just want to know
where my little girl was.

869
01:17:50,903 --> 01:17:52,295
[Rick]
I took her to Dennis's.

870
01:17:52,339 --> 01:17:53,644
I told you I had drops to do.

871
01:17:53,688 --> 01:17:54,863
- [Jessie] Dennis?!
- [Rick] She had a blast.

872
01:17:54,907 --> 01:17:55,950
[Jessie]
Are you insane?

873
01:17:55,994 --> 01:17:57,126
And you bought her a kitten.

874
01:17:57,170 --> 01:17:58,998
[Rick]
No, she stole the kitten.

875
01:18:00,564 --> 01:18:01,609
You're starting
to make me angry.

876
01:18:01,652 --> 01:18:02,871
[Jessie]
I just... I don't understand.

877
01:18:02,914 --> 01:18:04,090
That's all. I don't...
I don't understand.

878
01:18:04,133 --> 01:18:06,570
[arguing
continues indistinctly]

879
01:18:13,316 --> 01:18:14,883
- [argument continues]
- [Rick] Stop whining.

880
01:18:14,927 --> 01:18:16,450
Stop whining at me!

881
01:18:18,191 --> 01:18:19,539
- [cat meows]
- [Emma shushes]

882
01:18:19,583 --> 01:18:20,889
Sweet kitty, sweet kitty.

883
01:18:20,932 --> 01:18:23,152
Shh, shh...

884
01:18:23,196 --> 01:18:24,501
- [slaps hitting skin]
- God damn it!

885
01:18:25,981 --> 01:18:29,115
[argument continues]

886
01:18:50,266 --> 01:18:51,528
[meows]

887
01:19:31,873 --> 01:19:33,092
[meows]

888
01:19:35,007 --> 01:19:36,617
[yowls]

889
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:39,794
[yowling loudly]

890
01:19:46,801 --> 01:19:49,630
[yowling continues]

891
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:09,084
[yowling continues]

892
01:20:11,521 --> 01:20:13,088
[meows]

893
01:20:21,009 --> 01:20:22,793
[social worker] And are you
getting to know your dad, then?

894
01:20:24,230 --> 01:20:25,492
Um...

895
01:20:26,536 --> 01:20:27,537
Yeah.

896
01:20:32,673 --> 01:20:34,762
Mr. Pilsko?

897
01:20:37,112 --> 01:20:39,288
Have you been spending some
quality time together?

898
01:20:45,207 --> 01:20:46,382
He tucked her in.

899
01:20:47,775 --> 01:20:50,865
He... he... walked her
to school one day.

900
01:20:50,908 --> 01:20:54,695
Uh, they're getting acquainted,
in God's own good rhythm.

901
01:20:54,738 --> 01:20:56,218
That sounds nice.

902
01:20:59,743 --> 01:21:01,136
Um...

903
01:21:02,311 --> 01:21:04,966
So, what did you talk about
on the way to school?

904
01:21:07,142 --> 01:21:08,274
Terrorists.

905
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:11,625
Uh, okay.

906
01:21:13,757 --> 01:21:16,325
[papers shuffle]

907
01:21:22,984 --> 01:21:25,117
Dear Lord... [mumbles]

908
01:21:35,649 --> 01:21:36,954
[sighs heavily]

909
01:21:45,093 --> 01:21:46,312
Good night.

910
01:21:46,355 --> 01:21:47,487
[Emma] Good night.

911
01:21:50,316 --> 01:21:53,667
[footsteps]

912
01:22:01,718 --> 01:22:03,633
[Lonnie] I told you
