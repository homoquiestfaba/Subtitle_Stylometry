00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:48,048
( Woman Echoing )
It's a great pleasure--
2
00:00:48,122 --> 00:00:50,989
( Echoing )
It's a great pleasure--
3
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:56,326
It's a great pleasure
to have all of you here today.
4
00:01:00,735 --> 00:01:03,863
l thought you all
might begin your tour here.
5
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:08,341
( Shouting )
6
00:01:10,678 --> 00:01:14,444
( Man ) I really didn't want
a bachelor party in the first place.
7
00:01:14,515 --> 00:01:17,507
I'll tell you why. lt's not
that l'm against tradition.
8
00:01:17,585 --> 00:01:21,112
There's just something bizarre about
having a strange, naked woman...
9
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:23,714
dance around me while
my friends yell out,
10
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,021
''Go for it, Ben.
11
00:01:26,094 --> 00:01:28,460
Last night of freedom, Ben. "
12
00:01:28,529 --> 00:01:31,794
Last night of freedom
for what ?
13
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:34,858
Which is what I told
my best friend Alan.
14
00:01:34,936 --> 00:01:38,428
I didn't want any strippers.
I didn't wanna get lucky.
15
00:01:38,506 --> 00:01:41,475
l was lucky enough
just getting married.
16
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:44,511
- All right. Quiet !
- ( Shouting )
17
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,675
Guys !
18
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,982
All right. l'm not payin' tor that.
lt already was chipped.
19
00:01:53,054 --> 00:01:58,151
We're here to, uh, wish Ben
good luck and good riddance...
20
00:01:58,226 --> 00:02:01,718
as he heads down
that rocky path to matrimony.
21
00:02:01,796 --> 00:02:03,957
And, uh, hey, you know what.
22
00:02:04,032 --> 00:02:07,331
Ben's dad Richard and his grandpa Max
are here. Where are you guys ?
23
00:02:07,402 --> 00:02:11,566
Those guys-- Watch out.
You guys gotta pace yourselves.
24
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:15,097
Knowing Ben, l'd have
to say that he's probably,
25
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:19,704
- uh, one of the most loyal guys
that l've ever met,
- ( Man ) Like a dog !
26
00:02:19,781 --> 00:02:21,840
- ( Man Barks )
- and, uh, monogamous.
27
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:26,376
And so this is probably
gonna be the last time...
28
00:02:26,454 --> 00:02:29,218
that you're gonna spend
in a room with your friends...
29
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,021
and a n-n-naked woman...
30
00:02:33,094 --> 00:02:35,756
other than your wife, man !
31
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,458
So you can close your eyes
if you want to. Close 'em !
32
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:43,402
But then you're gonna be missin'
Juanita, the bull tamer !
33
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:46,065
( Shouting )
34
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,819
You don't have to do this.
35
00:03:08,429 --> 00:03:11,023
You really don't
have to do this.
36
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:15,058
( Man Shouts )
37
00:03:27,115 --> 00:03:29,743
Very nice.
38
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:38,590
( Crowd )
Ole !
39
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,450
Pop ?
40
00:04:08,523 --> 00:04:10,286
Pop ?
41
00:04:10,358 --> 00:04:12,986
Pop ? Max ?
42
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,689
Call 911.
43
00:04:22,503 --> 00:04:27,839
( Sighs )
How did this happen ? Hmm ?
44
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:29,843
What's the ditterence
how it happened ?
45
00:04:29,911 --> 00:04:31,845
- I wanna know how it happened.
- lt happened.
46
00:04:31,913 --> 00:04:33,471
lt makes a difterence
to me.
47
00:04:33,548 --> 00:04:35,482
All ot a sudden he has
a heart attack out of no place ?
48
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,882
Mom, can we please
not talk about this now ?
49
00:04:37,952 --> 00:04:39,886
What is it you don't
want to talk about ?
50
00:04:39,954 --> 00:04:43,549
Mrs. Holmes, it it's any consolation, l
think he was having a really good time.
51
00:04:43,624 --> 00:04:45,558
- Alan, shut up.
- Okay.
52
00:04:45,626 --> 00:04:48,356
- Come into the hall.
- What is in the hall ?
53
00:04:48,429 --> 00:04:50,556
A vending machine.
Come on, butchki.
54
00:04:50,631 --> 00:04:53,566
- Who's hungry ? l'm buying.
- All hours ot the night--
55
00:04:53,634 --> 00:04:56,831
This is insane.
56
00:04:56,904 --> 00:04:59,395
( Richard )
He probably just ate some spicy food.
57
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:01,464
lt was spicy, all right,
but it wasn't tood.
58
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:03,510
- Butchki !
- What ?
59
00:05:03,578 --> 00:05:05,910
Richard, you are
the silliest old tart.
60
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:11,213
( Sighs )
Grandpa, what came over you ?
61
00:05:11,285 --> 00:05:13,344
( Breathing Heavily )
Hmm ?
62
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:16,549
- Hey.
- Ben.
63
00:05:16,624 --> 00:05:19,559
- You all right ?
- ( Chuckles ) Ben.
64
00:05:19,627 --> 00:05:24,496
She was the most
beautitul woman l ever saw.
65
00:05:24,565 --> 00:05:27,261
What about Nana ?
66
00:05:27,335 --> 00:05:31,669
Did you ever take a good look
at your grandmother ?
67
00:05:31,739 --> 00:05:34,037
Woman looked like Tolstoy.
68
00:05:34,108 --> 00:05:37,339
l was never
attracted to her.
69
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:41,074
Oh, maybe in the beginning,
70
00:05:41,148 --> 00:05:44,879
because she was the only woman
I'd ever been with.
71
00:05:44,952 --> 00:05:49,321
Well, you know, that's great.
That's, uh-- That's loyalty.
72
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,915
Loyalty ? lt's fear.
73
00:05:51,993 --> 00:05:54,962
Did you ever teel her arms, her--
( Groans )
74
00:05:55,029 --> 00:06:00,262
Oh, Ben, I used to
dream about other women.
75
00:06:00,334 --> 00:06:02,962
What it would be like
to hold them and to--
76
00:06:03,037 --> 00:06:05,267
- Okay.
- Touch them and to--
77
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:07,307
- That's--
- Smell them.
78
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:10,936
Grandma smelled. She had
a very distinct smell. lt was a--
79
00:06:11,012 --> 00:06:12,980
Ben. Ben.
80
00:06:14,782 --> 00:06:16,716
Listen to me.
81
00:06:16,784 --> 00:06:19,082
Don't tie yourselt down.
82
00:06:19,153 --> 00:06:22,145
Even if you love
a woman, it tades.
83
00:06:22,223 --> 00:06:26,319
Marriage is a prison.
84
00:06:26,394 --> 00:06:30,262
- ( Siren Wails )
- Ben !
85
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,839
Could l help you out ?
Here we go.
86
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:46,175
- You just passed my room.
- Sorry.
87
00:06:46,247 --> 00:06:48,078
Feel better.
88
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:50,140
- ( Sighs )
- Hi.
89
00:06:50,217 --> 00:06:53,345
- Hi, sweetie.
- Honey.
90
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:58,757
Oh, why does everything feel
so much better now that you're here ?
91
00:06:58,826 --> 00:07:01,158
- How's he doing ?
- He's stable.
92
00:07:01,228 --> 00:07:03,662
- You know, physically, at least.
- Great.
93
00:07:03,731 --> 00:07:05,790
What happened ?
94
00:07:05,866 --> 00:07:09,324
What do you expect ? He's an 80-year-old
man with high blood pressure...
95
00:07:09,403 --> 00:07:14,340
and a naked balloon-popping toreador
is a rough combination.
96
00:07:14,408 --> 00:07:17,434
- lt didn't pan out. lt's not funny.
- lt's not funny.
97
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:20,776
- Be serious.
- There's something l want to do.
98
00:07:20,848 --> 00:07:25,478
- Okay. Why ?
- l wanna be able to remember
this moment in 30 or 40 years.
99
00:07:25,553 --> 00:07:28,647
Think my next husband
will get a kick out of it.
100
00:07:28,723 --> 00:07:30,657
Oh, that's nice.
Okay.
101
00:07:30,725 --> 00:07:35,321
lt's the night before I am flying down
to Savannah tor our wedding alone,
102
00:07:35,396 --> 00:07:40,857
because Ben's grandtather, who we
will now reter to as Larry Flynt,
103
00:07:40,935 --> 00:07:43,597
has partied himselt
into intensive care.
104
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:47,698
- What do you have to say ?
- Put the video camera away.
105
00:07:47,775 --> 00:07:50,903
No, no, no, honey,
you're not going to get off that easy.
106
00:07:50,978 --> 00:07:52,912
No, l'm saving it
for my vows.
107
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,073
l have already
finished my vows.
108
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:58,084
- What's in 'em ?
- ( Laughs )
109
00:07:58,152 --> 00:08:01,246
You know why ? Because
it's easy tor you. l'm a writer.
110
00:08:01,322 --> 00:08:05,349
- Oh, really ?
- l can't just slap something
down on paper like you do.
111
00:08:05,426 --> 00:08:08,884
Ben, listen.
112
00:08:11,832 --> 00:08:15,359
You don't have
to be brilliant...
113
00:08:15,436 --> 00:08:19,270
or witty or clever
or polite even.
114
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,969
Just have
to be honest.
115
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,342
Come on. Say something.
What are you feeling ?
116
00:08:25,413 --> 00:08:29,110
Are you nervous ?
Are you happy ? Are you scared ?
117
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,981
Am l scared ?
What would I be scared ot ?
118
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:36,956
- l'm scared.
- You are ? Why ?
Now you're making me scared.
119
00:08:37,024 --> 00:08:41,290
Because it's a big thing. lt's our
marriage. lt's the rest of our lives.
120
00:08:41,362 --> 00:08:43,853
lt's-- lt's scary.
121
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:47,799
l know. l'm not scared.
122
00:08:47,868 --> 00:08:50,928
- The only thing we have to tear--
- Yeah ?
123
00:08:51,005 --> 00:08:55,305

This is your present, okay ?
lt's a book ot quotes.
138
00:09:37,585 --> 00:09:40,452
I crossed out the ones l'm gonna
use in my toast. Listen.
139
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:43,149
''To say that you can love
one person all your lite...
140
00:09:43,224 --> 00:09:48,218
is like saying that one candle will
continue to burn as long as you live.''
141
00:09:48,295 --> 00:09:51,822
- Think about that for a minute.
- l will. That's profound.
142
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,833
This is used.

l had Chinese tood with me, figurin'
it wouId be a nice romantic surprise.
331
00:21:14,347 --> 00:21:16,281
She starts singin'
in the shower.
332
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:20,115
What's that song ?
''Up in the sky'' ? ''Up with the eagles'' ?
333
00:21:20,187 --> 00:21:23,452
- ''Wind Beneath My Wings.''
Very touching song.
- ''Wind Beneath My Wings.''
334
00:21:23,523 --> 00:21:27,186
Suddenly there's another
voice in the shower with her.
335
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,319
- Oh, no.
- A baritone.
336
00:21:29,396 --> 00:21:31,455
Uh-oh.
337
00:21:31,531 --> 00:21:33,556
Now it's a treakin' duet.
338
00:21:33,633 --> 00:21:36,966
So l walk in the bathroom and
there she is... with my brother.
339
00:21:37,037 --> 00:21:40,666
- Oh !
- l grab my brother and throw
him through the window naked.
340
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,732
He broke his leg
in two difterent places.
341
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:46,574
Dare we ask what,
uh, became of your wife ?
342
00:21:46,646 --> 00:21:49,843
l put the wind beneath her ass
and sent her packin'. Divorced her.
343
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:54,819
She never got a penny,
the lyin', whorin', adulteratin' pig.
344
00:21:54,888 --> 00:21:57,618
What about you, sweetheart ?
What's your story ?
345
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:01,491
l'm going down to visit my brother
and hang out with my nephew.
346
00:22:01,561 --> 00:22:03,756
That's nice. kids.
347
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:08,529
- Yep. Got any ?
- Nah. But l see 'em all over.
348
00:22:13,907 --> 00:22:17,707
So what else have you
jacket copywritten ?
349
00:22:17,777 --> 00:22:21,577
What else did l do ?
The low point of my career was...
350
00:22:21,648 --> 00:22:25,880
l did the blurb
tor a thriller...
351
00:22:25,952 --> 00:22:27,943
about a woman--
an archaeologist--
352
00:22:28,021 --> 00:22:30,854
who tinds love
in the pyramids.
353
00:22:30,924 --> 00:22:33,154
lt was called
Me And My Pharaoh.
354
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,285
- l have that book.
- No, you don't.
355
00:22:35,362 --> 00:22:39,799
Yes, l do. ''A scintillating tale
ot erotic mummitication.''
356
00:22:39,866 --> 00:22:41,800
l wrote that line.
357
00:22:41,868 --> 00:22:44,268
Oh, my God ! That's
why I bought the book.
358
00:22:44,337 --> 00:22:48,637
Anybody who could tind embalming
either scintillating or erotic...
359
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:50,676
had to be read.
360
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:55,306
- It was brilliant.
- Well, you know, l mean,
it's all about adjectives.
361
00:22:55,382 --> 00:22:58,579
l was gonna go with ''engaging tale
ot erotic mummitication'' tirst.
362
00:22:58,652 --> 00:23:00,950
- But then l said, no, scintillating.
- Right on the money.
363
00:23:01,021 --> 00:23:05,048
lt's still selling now,
but at least l get to write.
364
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:07,320
What do you do ?
365
00:23:07,394 --> 00:23:11,228
l haven't settled down
to one particular thing yet.
366
00:23:11,298 --> 00:23:14,961
Worked at galleries, sold cars,
tried out tor ''Aladdin On lce.''
367
00:23:15,035 --> 00:23:18,402
Um, wedding videographer.
368
00:23:18,471 --> 00:23:21,565
l got fired, though, because
apparently nobody wants a crash zoom...
369
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:24,610
to the priest
during the ceremony.
370
00:23:24,678 --> 00:23:28,944

hostess at the New York auto show.
371

( Chattering )
377
00:23:47,701 --> 00:23:51,102
Don't you think this is
just a little bit over the top ?
378
00:23:51,171 --> 00:23:53,162
Oh, so what it it is ?
379
00:23:53,239 --> 00:23:55,036

a time crunch here, too, okay ?

lf l don't make it down to Savannah by
Saturday morning, l lose 25,000 bucks.

Plus he's got three priors
tor possession and selling.

And there was ten ounces in the vehicle
that he admits is his.

there were drugs in the car ?

-No, sir. ln fact, l just met this man--
-You can't--

You can't ask us these questions
without an attorney present.
437

You haven't advised us
of our rights.
438
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,561
l believe that's called--
439
00:27:10,637 --> 00:27:14,129
Oh-- Ah !
A Miranda violation. That's it.
440
00:27:14,207 --> 00:27:17,040
This is a
very simple procedure.
441

You tell me you didn't do
anything illegal. you sign a
statement. And you go quietly.

Sir, l'd like to be considered
separate from her, sir.
443

didn't you understand ?
- What are you doing ?

l don't want to be rude or anything,
454
00:28:12,765 --> 00:28:14,824
but in situations like this,
l think about...

00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:18,166
what l would want Bridget to do
it the situation were reversed.
456
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:21,833

that comtortable with her...

together with some guy...

you know, kind ot a connection...

of a thing like that.

- You have no idea what l'm--
- Oh, no, no, not really.
465
00:28:50,536 --> 00:28:53,630
Fascinating. Okay.
466
00:28:53,706 --> 00:28:56,038
Maybe we just shouldn't
ride down together,
467
00:28:56,109 --> 00:29:00,068

made kind of a chump out of myselt.

to do what the preacher told us.

- Failure's a fantastic teacher.
977
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:25,271
You could learn from my mistakes.
l could tell you...
978
01:02:25,349 --> 01:02:27,874
everything l hated about my husbands and
my boytriends so you don't do the same.
979
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:30,318
- Should l get a pad ?
- Get a scroll.
980
01:02:30,388 --> 01:02:32,413
- A scroll ? ( Chuckles )
- Aw, okay.
981
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:36,551
Never forget her birthday. Make
a really, really big deaI out of it.
982
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:38,788
Atter sex, hold her
for a little while.
983
01:02:38,863 --> 01:02:41,388
- You know, talk to her
like a human being.
- Ah.
984
01:02:41,465 --> 01:02:45,424
Uh, oh, and do not
wear your socks to bed.
985
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:47,437
- Why ?
- No socks to bed,
986
01:02:47,505 --> 01:02:50,099
because you might not be
all that attractive to begin with.
987
01:02:50,174 --> 01:02:52,108
( Chuckles )
No. keep going.
988
01:02:52,176 --> 01:02:55,668
Always, always side with her
in an argument with your mother.
989
01:02:55,746 --> 01:03:00,376
Um, listen to her
like you mean it.
990
01:03:00,451 --> 01:03:04,387
Supportiveness is
a really, reaIly sexy turn-on.
991
01:03:04,455 --> 01:03:06,389
- Never, ever hit.
- No.
992
01:03:06,457 --> 01:03:09,517
No.
And, um,
993
01:03:09,593 --> 01:03:12,187
-no matter what annoying habits she has,
-Mm-hmm.
994
01:03:12,263 --> 01:03:16,393
just realize that she's
dealing with a huge mountain
ot imperfections every day.
995
01:03:16,467 --> 01:03:19,868
So you might just
want to let it go.
996
01:03:19,937 --> 01:03:22,064
- That's it.
- That's it ?
997
01:03:22,139 --> 01:03:25,404
Yep.
998
01:03:58,676 --> 01:04:00,837
- Hey, can l sit there ?
- Hey.
999
01:04:03,147 --> 01:04:05,911
( No Audio )
1000
01:04:05,983 --> 01:04:07,917
- Hey-- Aaah ! Ohhh !
- Oh !
1001
01:04:07,985 --> 01:04:10,545
Uh, let's get some air.
1002
01:04:10,621 --> 01:04:14,148
- Why ?
- l'm just-- l'm hot. ( Mumbling )
1003
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:16,921
Grilled prawns
or something ?
1004
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:20,997
One second.
1005
01:04:27,505 --> 01:04:29,666
- What's the matter with you ?
- Hmm ?
1006
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,867
- What's the matter with you ?
- Nothing's the matter with me. Do, uh--
1007
01:04:31,942 --> 01:04:34,775
- Do you know how to swim ?
- Of course l know how to swim.
1008
01:04:52,797 --> 01:04:56,028
( Laughing )
1009
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,534
Aaah !
1010
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:07,002
( Debbie ) l'm tellin' you,
l saw him come out here.
1011
01:05:07,077 --> 01:05:10,046
That-- That's him down there.
That's him.
1012
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:13,481
- l don't see anything.
- There's a body
at the bottom ot the pool.
1013
01:05:13,551 --> 01:05:15,849
No, l think that's
just a big drain.
1014
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:19,378
-( Chuckles )
-l don't know what you're talking about.
1015
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:22,426
- Oh, and P. S.-- you're a moron.
- ( Grunts )
1016
01:05:22,493 --> 01:05:24,552
HelIo ? Excuse me ?
Hi. Hi.
1017
01:05:24,628 --> 01:05:27,529
- Do you know Ben Holmes ?
- ( Coughs ) l'm sorry. know who ?
1018
01:05:27,598 --> 01:05:29,589
Ben Holmes. ls that Ben
at the bottom of the pool ?
1019
01:05:29,667 --> 01:05:32,500
l don't know, but l could
go ask tor you.
1020
01:05:32,570 --> 01:05:35,300
( Alan ) It's not Ben, okay ?
He's afraid of the water.
1021
01:05:35,372 --> 01:05:38,830
He goes to the beach in a suit and tie.
Come on, let's go.
1022
01:05:38,909 --> 01:05:41,343
I found it !
l got it, l got it.
1023
01:05:41,412 --> 01:05:43,676
- What ?
- Goldarn contact lenses.
1024
01:05:43,747 --> 01:05:47,012
- ( Chuckles )
- You oughta just stick with glasses.
1025
01:05:47,084 --> 01:05:49,018
Oh, hey, guys ?
What's going on ? What's happening ?
1026
01:05:49,086 --> 01:05:51,213
- Hi.
- Hey, Alan.
1027
01:05:51,288 --> 01:05:53,381
This is Sarah.
Sarah, Alan.
1028
01:05:53,457 --> 01:05:56,085
- This is my best man at my wedding.
- Hey. How are you ?
1029
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,094
Debbie.
This is the maid of honor.
1030
01:05:58,162 --> 01:06:00,460
- Hi, Debbie.
- Hi.
1031
01:06:00,531 --> 01:06:02,522
So, how'd you two
hook up ?
1032
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:04,761
Uh, l wouIdn't say
that we're hooked up, really.
1033
01:06:04,835 --> 01:06:09,898
l sort ot barely
know this person, but--
1034
01:06:09,974 --> 01:06:12,636
You were on the bus, right ?
Yeah, we rode down on the bus together.
1035
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:16,168
There's a whole group of folks.
Rode down together.
1036
01:06:16,247 --> 01:06:19,444
Okay, and the whole
pool thing ?
1037
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:22,008
She tell in the pool,
and uh,
1038
01:06:22,086 --> 01:06:24,987
didn't look like
she was a strong swimmer.
1039
01:06:25,055 --> 01:06:27,114
She was kind of
flailing around, so l--
1040
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:30,217
There's no lifeguard on duty
if you see the sign there,
1041
01:06:30,294 --> 01:06:33,695
So I jumped in,
and you know, hauled her out.
1042
01:06:33,764 --> 01:06:36,733
Then, in the course ot that,
the contact lens tell out.
1043
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:40,031
Here you go, miss. You oughta be caretul
with these, because they're--
1044
01:06:40,104 --> 01:06:42,072
Here you go.
lt's your contact lens.
1045
01:06:42,139 --> 01:06:44,505
That's a great story.
1046
01:06:44,575 --> 01:06:48,705
Bridget's really lucky
to be marrying such a great swimmer.
1047
01:06:48,779 --> 01:06:52,840
- Whoa ! What happened here ?
- ( Chuckles )
1048
01:06:52,917 --> 01:06:55,385
Well, perhaps after you dry off,
you'll come back in for another dance ?
1049
01:06:55,452 --> 01:06:58,421
- You got it, Herman.
- Dr. Holmes, you don't mind...
1050
01:06:58,489 --> 01:07:01,185
if l dance with your wite,
do you ?
1051
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:06,094
Yeah. You don't mind,
do you sweetie ?
1052
01:07:06,163 --> 01:07:09,792
- All right, all right.
Well, l'll see you in there.
- ( Sarah ) Okay.
1053
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:32,021
l'm pretty disappointed
in you, Ben.
1054
01:07:32,089 --> 01:07:34,387
You know, everybody's always
telling Bridget she's so lucky...
1055
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:36,392
because you're such
a nice guy.
1056
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:39,725
Debbie, l am a nice guy, all right ?
This is not what you think.
1057
01:07:39,797 --> 01:07:42,197
Okay. ( Chuckles )
Whatever, Dr. Holmes.
1058
01:07:42,266 --> 01:07:44,962
Okay ?
1059
01:07:46,737 --> 01:07:50,901
- Alan ?
- Ben, you don't need to explain, okay ?
1060
01:07:50,975 --> 01:07:53,239
Remember, l'm the guy
who begged you...
1061
01:07:53,310 --> 01:07:55,574
to sleep with more women
before you got married.
1062
01:07:55,646 --> 01:07:57,739
l am not sleeping
with her, man !
1063
01:07:57,815 --> 01:07:59,749
Okay ?
There's nothing going on !
1064
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:04,353
Why-- Why won't you
listen to me ?
1065
01:08:04,421 --> 01:08:07,879
- Maybe because l'm
getting married tomorrow ?
- All right, look, Ben.
1066
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:10,017
lt you're not gonna
take advantage ot a night...
1067
01:08:10,094 --> 01:08:15,555
that's gonna get you through many sad,
pathetic, lonely years, then--
1068
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:17,624
( Chuckles )
My God.
1069
01:08:17,701 --> 01:08:19,692
l'll see you in the lobby
in five minutes.
1070
01:08:23,507 --> 01:08:25,441
( Sighs )
1071
01:08:28,345 --> 01:08:30,404
l hate to remind you,
but we had a deal, remember ?
1072
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:33,712
You were supposed to be my husband if l
got you a ride. Do you remember that ?
1073
01:08:33,784 --> 01:08:35,877
Yes, l remember
that arrangement.
1074
01:08:35,953 --> 01:08:38,285
l did not, however,
presuppose the tact that Debbie...
1075
01:08:38,355 --> 01:08:41,552
is now on her way down to tell
my tiancee that l am holed up...
1076
01:08:41,625 --> 01:08:44,526
in a hotel room in South Carolina
somewhere with a woman...
1077
01:08:44,595 --> 01:08:46,825
claiming to be the wife
ot the good Dr. Ben Holmes !
1078
01:08:46,897 --> 01:08:49,866
What was l supposed to do ?
The Sunshine people think we're married.
1079
01:08:49,933 --> 01:08:54,632
They would have stoned us.
As it is, l already feel bad
enough about not buying a condo.
1080
01:08:54,705 --> 01:08:56,639
Why don't you just
tell Bridget the truth ?
1081
01:08:56,707 --> 01:08:59,039
What kind ot marriage do you have
if she doesn't believe you ?
1082
01:08:59,109 --> 01:09:01,771
- Just explain why you're with me--
- Sarah, l'm not with you !
1083
01:09:01,845 --> 01:09:04,211
We're not together !
This is not a relationship !
1084
01:09:04,281 --> 01:09:07,307
l just happen to be traveling
alongside a natural disaster !
1085
01:09:07,384 --> 01:09:09,852
- You know what ?
l realIy feel sorry for you.
- ( Sarcastic Chuckle )
1086
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,048
'Cause at least when l was getting
married, l could admit l was scared.
1087
01:09:13,123 --> 01:09:16,718
- WelI, save me your pity,
because l am not scared.
- You know what ?
1088
01:09:16,794 --> 01:09:20,161
You have such a problem
with honesty, Ben, you know that ?
1089
01:09:20,230 --> 01:09:22,391
- Oh.
- You can't tell your tiancee
what's going on.
1090
01:09:22,466 --> 01:09:26,061
You can't explain something absolutely
simple and innocent to your best man,
1091
01:09:26,136 --> 01:09:28,195
and you are
with me, Ben !
1092
01:09:28,272 --> 01:09:30,240
You could have left a hundred times,
but you didn't !
1093
01:09:30,307 --> 01:09:33,333
- I tried to !
- Then why are you still here ?
1094
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:35,935
l'm leaving !
All right, tine !
1095
01:09:36,013 --> 01:09:38,880
You wanna talk about honesty ?
Let's talk about honesty.
1096
01:09:38,949 --> 01:09:41,884
- Bring it on.
- You complain about your lite,
nonstop, all the time.
1097
01:09:41,952 --> 01:09:43,886
( Mimicking Sarah )
lt's all your tault.
1098
01:09:43,954 --> 01:09:47,788
You are a beautiful, incredible woman.
You could have any guy you wanted,
1099
01:09:47,858 --> 01:09:49,985
but you keep picking
these losers.
1100
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:52,426
And the only thing l can think ot
is that you choose these guys...
1101
01:09:52,496 --> 01:09:55,488
who are intellectually inferior to you
so that you can control them,
1102
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:59,627
but still teel conveniently wounded
when the relationship ends.
1103
01:09:59,703 --> 01:10:03,230
You're the one that's afraid
of commitment. You back out
of every job you ever have !
1104
01:10:03,307 --> 01:10:06,071
You run away from anyone
and anything,
1105
01:10:06,143 --> 01:10:08,703
and you think it's so
unconventional and liberating,
1106
01:10:08,779 --> 01:10:11,839
when in tact, it's just
cowardice and juvenile...
1107
01:10:11,915 --> 01:10:14,008
and unable to face
the real world !
1108
01:10:14,084 --> 01:10:17,315
Ha ! Okay, you want honesty,
l'll give you honesty.
1109
01:10:17,387 --> 01:10:19,446
Do you know why you can't
write your marriage vows ?
1110
01:10:19,523 --> 01:10:22,549
Because you are absolutely territied
that you have nothing to say.
1111
01:10:22,626 --> 01:10:25,618
And why would you, Ben ?
Because you run around so scared...
1112
01:10:25,696 --> 01:10:29,894
that lite is gonna throw you this
curveball that'll completely shatter...
1113
01:10:29,967 --> 01:10:33,767
this crystal clear, pertect
existence that you've created
for yourselt in your Day Timer,
1114
01:10:33,837 --> 01:10:38,035
that you blurb your way out of teeling
anything emotional, anything real.
1115
01:10:38,108 --> 01:10:41,669
You have no emotions, and that's
what makes you a shitty writer, Ben.
1116
01:10:41,745 --> 01:10:45,181
You know what ?
At least l don't sit around obsessing...
1117
01:10:45,249 --> 01:10:47,183
that no one's going to
come to my tuneral,
1118
01:10:47,251 --> 01:10:49,549
because l have relationships
that last longer than a week.
1119
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:51,554
- My funeral is gonna be packed !
- You know what, Ben ?
1120
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:54,614
That is just great.
And l know your eulogy...
1121
01:10:54,691 --> 01:10:56,625
is gonna look so nice
on the back of a book cover.
1122
01:10:56,693 --> 01:11:01,130
l just think you are
an immature, seltish person.
1123
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:03,598
WelI, l'm
obviously wrong.
1124
01:11:03,667 --> 01:11:07,125
Have a fabulous time in Westchester.
l do hope you enjoy the minivan.
1125
01:11:07,204 --> 01:11:12,232
God ! How great it must be to be
so cool and above everyone, huh ?
1126
01:11:12,309 --> 01:11:14,573
lt must be great !
Let me ask you somethin'.
1127
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:17,478
How cool is it
to abandon your kid ?
1128
01:11:17,548 --> 01:11:21,416
l was 17 years old, okay ? Fuck you.
You don't know anything about it.
1129
01:11:21,485 --> 01:11:23,578
- All right, weIl, try 27, Sarah,
- Nothing.
1130

We have a little harmless dancing...
1219

that gets us to Savannah
where l have &25,000 waiting tor me,

and you have what, 130 ot your closest
family and friends waiting for you.

we have-- oh, look, we have nothing.

Um, in about tive minutes, we're
supposed to be joined tor eternity,
1458
01:35:10,679 --> 01:35:13,580

No, no, l think technically
eternity starts immediately,

ice sculpture involved.
1463
01:35:25,561 --> 01:35:28,587

- Yeah.

( Thunder Rumbling )

1466
01:35:41,310 --> 01:35:43,904
( Sobs )
l'm sorry.

01:35:43,979 --> 01:35:47,608

you know ? ( Snitfles )
1468
01:35:47,683 --> 01:35:50,049

to get down here. Something happened.

lt's okay.
l know.
1470
01:35:52,354 --> 01:35:55,380
Debbie told me, and l told her that
it didn't matter because l trusted you,
1471
01:35:55,457 --> 01:35:58,688
and I knew you wouldn't
cheat on me.
1472
01:35:58,761 --> 01:36:03,721

Everything else was going wrong.
1473

Everything was going wrong,
and my parents are separated,
1474
01:36:06,502 --> 01:36:08,663
and then this guy Steve,
who--
1475
01:36:08,737 --> 01:36:10,705
Bridge, you know what ?
1476
01:36:10,773 --> 01:36:14,300

was this one perfect person
tor everybody in the world.

that person,

just kind ot magically taded away...

be inside this kind ot...

but there is no bubble.
1481
01:36:26,689 --> 01:36:29,590
l mean, or if there is,
we have to make it.
1482
01:36:29,658 --> 01:36:34,925
l just think that life is more
than a series of moments, you know ?
1483
01:36:36,699 --> 01:36:40,999
We can make choices, and we can choose
to protect the people we love,
1484
01:36:41,070 --> 01:36:44,130
and that's what makes us who we are,
and those are the real miracles.
1485
01:36:44,206 --> 01:36:47,175
Stop me when it just becomes glaringly
obvious that l have no idea...

- No, l know what you're talking about.

what you're taIking about.
1488
01:37:01,557 --> 01:37:04,253

1489
