1
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,777
We got it.

2
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:27,375
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's do it.

3
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,148
- Oh, my God!
- Pack it up.

4
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,621
Tear down. We're heading to Asia.

5
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,905
- Hey. Hey, how close are we?
- No problem.

6
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,002
- No, how close are we?
- I say, "No problem."

7
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,438
He said, "No problem."

8
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:58,844
Great.

9
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:06,623
- Hey, man, do you have to go so fast?
- Yeah!

10
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,491
- Why?
- I don't wanna lose to my brother.

11
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:12,064
- Wonderful!
- Okay, are you trying to ram us out?

12
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,081
Finally.

13
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,753
- Amazing!
- Yeah.

14
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,261
Load up your packs.
It's gonna be a walk the rest of the way.

15
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,814
What do you need those for?

16
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,284
- Need what?
- The gun.

17
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,146
Safety.

18
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,587
You don't go in the middle of nowhere
unprotected, man.

19
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,683
- Who is this guy?
- Hey, where are we exactly?

20
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,289
No name.

21
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,922
- No name?
- Virgin territory.

22
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,325
This area hasn't been mapped yet.
It's officially unexplored.

23
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,960
We're hundreds of miles
in the middle of nowhere.

24
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:28,530
- So who else knows we're here?
- You're looking at us.

25
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,607
Secrets travel fast in the caving world.

26
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:38,442
- How many years you say you been caving?
- Seven.

27
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:43,119
- Yeah.
- Lying bitch.

28
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:45,849
What?

29
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:00,871
There it is.

30
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,841
Hello!

31
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:17,640
Why?

32
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:19,846
Why not?

33
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:24,550
For an opening this big, there should be
enough light to see further inside.

34
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,649
Yeah.
I've never seen anything like it before.

35
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,352
Yeah, it's weird.

36
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:35,524
It's late.
The shadows are playing with our eyes.

37
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,694
I'll set up the flashes
and we'll snap off a couple.

38
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:41,331
No, no, no. We set up camp 20 yards back.
We'll cave in the morning.

39
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,705
- It'll take, like, two minutes.
- Nothing does.

40
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,844
Set up camp. We'll cave tomorrow.

41
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,047
Jackass.

42
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,312
Good to know.

43
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:00,153
- Do I have to wear a condom?
- Suck it. You're so...

44
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,061
Stop!

45
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,331
No! You want me to shove it up my ass,
I'll tell you no!

46
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,598
I can do all kinds of things with this
right now, but shove it up my ass?

47
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,193
That's where I draw the line.

48
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,068
That's a whole new ball game.

49
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:23,774
Every day.

50
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,313
He's in slow motion.

51
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,488
We call her Florence.

52
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:35,584
- What? Like Nightingale?
- Yeah.

53
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,253
- Why?
- Okay, stop!

54
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:41,265
Because on her first caving expedition,
someone got hurt.

55
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:47,397
So this guy cuts himself on his knee.

56
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:50,943
- Oh, wait. It wasn't just a cut.
- No, no, no. You're right.

57
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:55,537
It was a tiny cut. Tiny.

58
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:57,443
Oh, you bitch!

59
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,680
But Florence here decides
that she was going to wrap it,

60
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:05,188
and wrapped it,
and, yes, you may have guessed it,

61
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,088
- she wrapped it again.
- You bitch!

62
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:15,265
But seriously,
I'd love to lead my own cave expedition.

63
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:18,360
- Of children?
- Of grownups.

64
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:23,242
Be the first to explore a new cave.
It'd be amazing.

65
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,243
Certainly have a lot more fun
than those guys.

66
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,007
Especially Gannon.

67
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:34,753
- How long has it been?
- Two years tomorrow.

68
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,217
Yeah, that's what changed him.

69
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,827
What do you mean? What happened?

70
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:54,329
It won't go in the book.

71
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,840
If I tell you, you're gonna wanna put it in.

72
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,139
It won't.

73
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,175
You've got my word.

74
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,084
- Do you guys know?
- No.

75
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:15,092
We meet Gannon today.

76
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:21,496
All right, Ori, you can trust me.

77
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:31,074
Two years ago, we were caving in Peru.

78
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,415
Me, Miranda, Bailey, Domingo, Gannon...

79
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:42,717
There were some other guys there,
but they don't work for us anymore.

80
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,322
And there was another woman, Rachel,

81
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:50,794
his fiancée.

82
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,196
It was the beginning of the rainy season
in Peru,

83
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,202
and we were trying to get out

84
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,332
of a cave that was flooding.

85
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,382
And she didn't make it.

86
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:24,555
We were all, you know, really close to her.

87
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,701
I'm sorry.

88
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,973
Yeah. Gannon was the only one
that saw her die.

89
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,735
Her body was never found.

90
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,511
- Are you saying there's more to the story?
- No.

91
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:47,108
- Then what are you saying?
- Nothing.

92
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,184
That's it.

93
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,821
- Well, I'm gonna go to bed.
- Me, too.

94
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,260
Get some sleep.

95
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:27,750
So,

96
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,796
you guys thinking about tomorrow?

97
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,896
You getting what you need for your book?

98
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,992
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

99
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,730
Caving is a whole new world.

100
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:43,764
For a lot of people, I mean.

101
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,170
I mean, you know, you show them a photo,

102
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,769
it opens them up
to a whole new universe, right?

103
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,441
Every photo you sell furthers caving.

104
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,210
Yeah.

105
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:56,580
We're lucky to be making a living doing it.

106
00:10:56,856 --> 00:11:00,314
So... So what are your thoughts, exactly,

107
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:04,487
- on caving?
- What do you mean?

108
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:07,657
I mean, what's your philosophy?
How do you approach it?

109
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:10,868
I wanna know
what makes you go down there.

110
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:18,435
There's something about caves that's alive.

111
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:22,540
There's something down there that,
if we're open to it,

112
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,316
we can connect with.

113
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:29,381
I look for that connection
every time I go down.

114
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:30,853
I crave it.

115
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,915
You're a Brujo.

116
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,453
His father was.

117
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,490
So you believe in spirits?

118
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:45,729
- Like, spirit of the earth, spirit of the sun?
- Yeah, I do.

119
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:49,035
- And cave spirits?
- The most unpredictable of all.

120
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:53,342
Interesting.

121
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,576
Everyone has their own beliefs.

122
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:58,912
What's hanging from your neck?

123
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,080
It's a cross.

124
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:06,022
If something as magnificent
or as terrible as God is possible,

125
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,721
anything is, right?

126
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,389
Right?

127
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,492
- Yeah, but I wasn't saying...
- Throughout history,

128
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:20,902
caves have been a sacred place
for almost every religion in existence.

129
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:26,008
Remember, Jesus was buried
and resurrected in a cave.

130
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,848
I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to offend you.

131
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,688
- So why do you do it?
- We haven't found them all.

132
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:48,390
Everyone knows
where the highest mountains are,

133
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,528
the deepest seas.

134
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,170
But caves...

135
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:58,101
Caves are the last unexplored frontier
on earth.

136
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:02,575
There's nothing more exciting than that.

137
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,310
My grandfather used to climb through caves

138
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:08,443
to find new mining lines on the East Coast.

139
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:13,353
He'd say, "Apollo had it easy,

140
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:17,191
"'cause everyone knows
where the moon is.

141
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,494
"But no one knows where I'm going."

142
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,805
So are there any events

143
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:32,375
or anything about caving that you regret?

144
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,655
Over the years, I've found

145
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,563
that it's hard to control
what happens down there.

146
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,764
It's a beast,
and not all beasts can be tamed.

147
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:00,199
And that's what you need to understand.

148
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:04,865
Things happen in caves
that don't happen anywhere else.

149
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,206
When you're down there, you're in darkness,

150
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,780
an eternal, never-ending world of night.

151
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:19,556
Down there,
miles beneath the earth's surface,

152
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,522
you're surrounded by miles of rock.

153
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:30,799
You know a wrong step can send you
down a chasm hundreds of feet deep?

154
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:36,198
And if you get hurt down there,
maybe break an arm or break a leg,

155
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:41,371
there's no ambulance nearby, no hospital.

156
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:46,410
Chances are you won't be brought out alive.

157
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,824
The only way to survive it over and over
is to respect it.

158
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,558
Respect where you are.

159
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:01,691
Respect what it is.

160
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:19,682
- Bailey. Bailey.
- Hold on, I'm coming.

161
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,880
- Is everyone asleep?
- Yeah.

162
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:24,819
Come on, it'll be fun.

163
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:27,083
Stop!

164
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,578
Wait. What was that?

165
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:02,753
Bat?

166
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:17,501
Stop. It's not a fucking bat.

167
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,277
Say "fuck" like that again.

168
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,014
There's something there.

169
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,289
You're just worried about getting caught.

170
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,992
It isn't fun if you don't get caught.

171
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,099
- How you feeling?
- Fine.

172
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,537
- You?
- Ready to go.

173
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:21,539
Again.

174
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:23,604
Too bad.

175
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,459
- Hey.
- Hey.

176
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:57,975
It was today.

177
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:03,506
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

178
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,749
- I'll be fine.
- Good.

179
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:14,025
- I'm glad you're here.
- I know.

180
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,790
I know.

181
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:25,264
Come on.

182
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,487
How'd it go?

183
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,959
- We're about to find out.
- All right!

184
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,221
We ready?

185
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:53,696
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

186
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,909
Let's go.

187
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,181
Hold up.

188
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:45,172
- It's a long way down.
- Yeah.

189
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,503
Hey, set up a rappel line.

190
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:53,343
- So what are we gonna name this one?
- Hell's Pit.

191
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,718
Do we really wanna name it that?

192
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,949
- What?
- It's the Russian word for "hell."

193
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,494
- Then Ad's Pit it is.
<i>- Estúpidos.</i> Ready.

194
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,591
- All right.
- All right, I'll head down first.

195
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,594
Whoa, whoa.
How come you get all the booty?

196
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:13,830
'Cause I say so.

197
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,388
Shit!

198
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,865
- What's up?
- You okay?

199
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,958
- Hey, you all right?
- Gannon!

200
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,593
Yeah, I'm fine!

201
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,633
You bitch.

202
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:32,015
Off-rope! What do we got down here?

203
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:36,213
It used to be some sort of water funnel,
and the water drained in from above

204
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:39,119
and funneled
out of these passageways here.

205
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:46,930
- I got you.
- I have it.

206
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:47,999
Okay.

207
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,897
All right, I'll set up the flashes.

208
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,764
- No, we'll keep going.
- Off-rope!

209
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,862
We can take pictures of this
when we get back.

210
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,906
Off-rope.

211
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,052
Off-rope.

212
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,570
I'm done. What?

213
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,252
He hear us.

214
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,523
Good. Let's...

215
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:49,050
Whoa. What's going on?

216
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,362
What is this?

217
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,697
Never seen that before.

218
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:02,599
Magnetic plate?

219
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:07,036
Hey, we all have backup lights,
so we'll keep our eye on it.

220
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:09,045
- Let's cave.
- All right.

221
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,500
We got drippers here.

222
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:43,674
The water must have funneled out
from the main chamber at Ad's Pit

223
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:44,867
into here.

224
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:46,944
Either that or we're underneath a lake.

225
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,411
We should listen for water, guys.

226
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,381
- Let's pull right.
- How about we go straight?

227
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,643
How about we go straight?

228
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:19,743
What the...

229
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:23,742
- This cave is creeped out.
- Yeah.

230
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:25,907
Well, the wind means
there's more cave, so...

231
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:30,283
No. The cave is moaning.

232
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:34,019
It is making love.

233
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,353
And who's he doing, Slava? You?

234
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:39,987
Me? No, no, no.

235
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,895
It is fucking you.

236
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,998
Sorry, guy. I don't do Russian caves.

237
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,301
Did you ever do an American cave?

238
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:53,609
Slava, you ever do an American cave?

239
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,078
Hey, Slava!

240
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,520
He was right here.

241
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,220
Vlad? Vlad?

242
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,603
No, that's the wrong one.

243
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:04,745
- That's where the cord leads to.
- We came out of that one.

244
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,407
Yeah, well,
if the cord's going down that hole,

245
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,577
that's where we came from.

246
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:16,116
She's right. Footprint.

247
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:19,492
- Well, then, somebody moved the cord.
- Or something.

248
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,486
Hold on, guys.

249
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,817
- Blood.
- Oh, my God!

250
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,451
Oh, shit.

251
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:54,822
Don't worry.

252
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:58,494
Calm down. Calm down! Shut up! Come on.

253
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:40,003
Did you see that?

254
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,375
What?

255
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,449
Slava?

256
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:55,089
Come here.

257
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:01,127
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- What the hell!

258
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:03,966
- What did this? What did this, man?
- Slava!

259
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:06,164
Oh, shit!

260
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:09,369
Sit up! Sit up!

261
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,601
- Okay. Hey.
- Can you hear me?

262
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:13,876
What did this to you, man? What did this?

263
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,071
There's not enough time!
We gotta get him out now!

264
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:18,376
- Oh, shit!
- We gotta get him out of here!

265
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:24,250
All right, all right.

266
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,148
Ori, lift him up.

267
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,051
I'm moving as fast as I can.

268
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,328
All right. Hold on, Slava, we got you.

269
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:33,727
- All right.
- Come! Here!

270
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,800
- Help me.
- Hang in there, Slava!

271
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,999
- Vlad! Vlad! Vlad!
- Come on!

272
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,337
We need help down here! Vlad!

273
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:47,070
- Gannon.
- What?

274
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:55,747
- Shit! What is going on here?
- We're fucked.

275
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,289
We're fucked.

276
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,289
What's that?

277
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:05,919
Hey, watch out!

278
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:37,217
Oh, my God.

279
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:05,483
Oh, my God.

280
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,415
- No one else knows we're down here?
- We're so fucked.

281
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:33,484
Don't say that.

282
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:36,644
- Does anybody else know where we are?
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

283
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:38,517
- We're so fucked.
- Don't fucking say that.

284
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,181
What, "we're fucked"? 'Cause we're fucked.

285
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,521
Does anybody fucking know,
or are we stranded down here?

286
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,288
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Just calm down, guys.

287
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:46,090
We got two fucking dead people
lying on the floor,

288
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:47,562
and you want me to calm down?

289
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:49,326
- We're gonna be okay.
- We're stranded in here!

290
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:50,992
- Calm down, y'all!
- We're stranded down here.

291
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,229
- You guys, stop!
- Will somebody answer me?

292
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:54,999
Just shut up, man.

293
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,301
Everybody shut up!

294
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:13,153
Now, calm yourselves down
and get control, okay?

295
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:20,428
- Okay?
- Okay. Hey, we're all right.

296
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:24,524
- We're all right, okay?
- Okay. Okay.

297
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:34,775
- Gannon?
- Yes.

298
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,646
Gannon, we lost him.

299
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:48,181
- What did this to him? An animal? A bear?
- No.

300
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:52,862
That wouldn't explain the burns
or the way his intestines...

301
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,899
No, I can't explain it. I don't understand.

302
00:33:57,001 --> 00:33:59,697
None of this is explainable
in physical terms.

303
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:01,066
What the hell does that mean?

304
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,834
- Listen, we don't need that right now, okay?
- What is it, huh?

305
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:07,172
Hold on, hold on. Stop it.
Will you calm down?

306
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:11,107
Yeah, can we worry about what did this
after we find a way out of here?

307
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:15,083
He's right. We're not gonna last too long
down here without any supplies.

308
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,690
My battery's almost dead.

309
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:21,625
- Me, too.
- Mine, too.

310
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,217
Weren't they supposed to last
longer than a couple of hours?

311
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:25,386
Yeah.

312
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:28,154
- Half empty.
- I know I charged them.

313
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,089
I know, man.

314
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,863
There's some sort of energy drain
going on down here.

315
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,404
Aren't they gonna last long enough
for us to get out of here?

316
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:38,566
It could take days
to find a new passage to the surface.

317
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:41,144
- What's the plan?
- We find another way out of here.

318
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:46,114
I'll lead. Domingo, cover the rear.

319
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:48,481
We'll leave the bodies for now.

320
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,382
Let's go!

321
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,246
What does the air current mean?

322
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:20,583
- Caving for seven years, huh?
- Yeah.

323
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:24,911
Air currents mean one of two things,

324
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:27,388
a surface route or a deeper cave.

325
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:40,560
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

326
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:44,274
It's gonna get a little tight in here, guys.

327
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:59,115
- Still feeling that current?
- Yeah.

328
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,533
- How much rock is above us?
- Much.

329
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:16,437
- How much?
- Lf we don't reach the surface, you'll know.

330
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,135
Shut up, Domingo.

331
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,258
Okay, looks like we get a little more room.

332
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:50,407
- Did you hear that?
- What?

333
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,010
Stop moving! Stop moving!

334
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:12,120
- What the...
- Holy shit.

335
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,394
Don't make any noise.

336
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,642
Quiet.

337
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,384
Don't make any noise.

338
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:41,686
What are you doing?

339
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,725
Shut up!

340
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,198
What are you... What are you doing?

341
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,567
Shut up! It's not working!

342
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:53,159
For fuck's sake, what are you doing?

343
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,611
It sees us.

344
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:17,216
Go! Go! Keep moving. Don't stop.

345
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,592
- Go, go, go, go!
- Come on! Go, go, go!

346
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:23,758
- Move, move, move!
- Go, go, go, go!

347
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,064
Domingo!

348
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:31,605
Get up, man! Come on!

349
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:33,969
Move, move, move, move!

350
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:36,046
Come on. Come on.

351
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,355
This cave has a soul.

352
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,240
Go! Go!

353
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,505
Go, go! We gotta get out of here, man!

354
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:12,343
Fuck! Move, move! Go!
Oh, holy shit, it's coming! Just get out!

355
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:14,608
Go! Go!

356
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:18,086
We gotta keep going.
Go on! Get out of here! Careful! Let's go!

357
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,247
Go!

358
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:20,691
Move!

359
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:24,655
- We gotta get out!
- Let's move. Let's move!

360
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:28,125
Move, move, move!

361
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:36,198
Okay, okay, okay.

362
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:39,002
What happened? What happened?

363
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:44,508
Gannon!

364
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,949
Oh, God.

365
00:39:57,795 --> 00:40:01,060
Where are you hurt?
Where are you hurt? Where are you hurt?

366
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:03,759
Not me. Domingo.

367
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:07,732
It got him. He wouldn't run.

368
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:11,200
It's some kind of beast or something.

369
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:13,276
Fuck you. Why'd you run?

370
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:17,044
- What?
- We left him there.

371
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:18,240
We didn't leave him. He wouldn't run.

372
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,748
- Are you listening?
- We could've helped him.

373
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,842
What are you talking about?
He was dead! Look at me!

374
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:24,750
You were gonna leave
before anything happened.

375
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:28,120
We had to. This could have been our blood.

376
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:32,662
That's the way it is. It's you or him.

377
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,130
- You or her.
- Her?

378
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:40,270
Peru. Two years ago today. Rachel.
You left her, too, remember?

379
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:43,704
You watched her drown. You saved yourself,
and you watched her drown!

380
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:45,975
Gannon, stop it!

381
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:47,668
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Ori!

382
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,939
- Gannon, stop it. Stop!
- Stop it.

383
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:52,641
- No, Gannon. No! No!
- Get off of him!

384
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,342
- You hear that, Ambrose?
- No!

385
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,283
You better put that in your book.

386
00:40:56,887 --> 00:41:00,186
People should know what this man did!
And it only gets better!

387
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,282
You weren't there!
You don't know what happened!

388
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:04,554
- Stop it!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

389
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:06,892
- Shouldn't we keep moving?
- He's right!

390
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:09,465
We got us this thing chasing us,
and you guys are fighting?

391
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,501
What is wrong with you?

392
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:17,105
Now, let's get moving.

393
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:23,475
This way.

394
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:03,286
- Come on. This could take us to the top.
- Yes.

395
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:13,590
Come on.

396
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:21,872
Come on.

397
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:28,105
- Oh, God.
- Fuck!

398
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:31,147
What? What? No. No.

399
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:32,215
What?

400
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,511
- Fuck!
- No.

401
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:36,586
No.

402
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:42,453
- Fuck! Fuck!
- Son of a bitch!

403
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:47,724
Maybe if we backtrack
and try one of the other passages...

404
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:51,465
- Yeah, maybe.
- Go back? No, no, no, no.

405
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:55,529
- How thick is this wall here?
- It's thick, man.

406
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:57,331
Stop it!

407
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:59,568
- Don't you guys carry drills?
- Yes.

408
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:02,407
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What are you doing?

409
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:04,174
Drill a hole in the wall, genius.

410
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:06,943
- Ambrose, calm down.
- Drill a hole in the fucking wall. Genius.

411
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:09,519
- Yeah, knock yourself out.
- Ambrose.

412
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,816
- Is this the longest bit you have?
- Yeah, man.

413
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,891
Don't you have a longer bit?

414
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:17,524
I need a longer bit!

415
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:19,693
Stupid jerk!

416
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:22,260
Ambrose, stop drilling.

417
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:30,671
Put the goddamn drill down, boy!

418
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,804
Calm yourself down.

419
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:37,278
Shit could be around the corner any minute.

420
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:42,217
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

421
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,513
It's okay. Relax.

422
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,282
- Okay?
- I only caved twice.

423
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:51,422
- No shit.
- Hey.

424
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,322
With tour groups.

425
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,861
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. Hey.

426
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:04,039
I wanna get out! I just wanna get out!

427
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,268
- I just wanna get out of here!
- We're gonna get out!

428
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:07,901
- Ambrose, we're gonna get out.
- Shut up!

429
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:10,105
We're gonna get out of here.

430
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:14,741
But I really need you
to pull yourself together right now, okay?

431
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:15,907
Okay?

432
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,112
Okay.

433
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:22,790
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

434
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,325
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

435
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:29,026
You're doing pretty great for a virgin.
Okay? Okay?

436
00:44:33,737 --> 00:44:36,103
Hey, guys, we're running out of options.

437
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:45,813
- Coming up on that intersection.
- Well, maybe we should turn off our lights.

438
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:48,476
I mean, that's how it found us
last time, right?

439
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:51,076
We're the only light source in this hellhole.
If we turn them off,

440
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,655
it's not gonna know
which tunnel to go down.

441
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:54,417
- It's a one-in-four chance.
- I'll take those odds.

442
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,425
- Everybody in agreement?
- Yeah.

443
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:58,492
Power down.

444
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,893
- Back lights.
- Listen.

445
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:11,866
Breathe quieter.

446
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,374
Oh, God!

447
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,689
- Oh, God!
- Run!

448
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,856
Don't leave me alone.

449
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:29,849
Hey, you okay? Come on!

450
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,250
- Yeah, you?
- I'm fine.

451
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:32,481
- Where's Ambrose?
- Come on!

452
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:34,489
- Guys, stop. Where's Ambrose?
- He didn't make it.

453
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:35,888
- He's gone?
- He didn't make it.

454
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:37,187
- Oh, God!
- I didn't see what happened.

455
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:39,159
- He didn't make it. Go!
- You know what happened, okay?

456
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:40,958
- We gotta keep moving. Let's go!
- All right.

457
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:44,124
- Okay.
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

458
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:01,182
Fuck! Fuck!

459
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:02,912
Shut up. Shut up.

460
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:06,786
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up!

461
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:08,289
Come on, come on, come on.

462
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:10,622
No, we're never gonna get out of this place.

463
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:12,888
- There's no way out of here.
- There is.

464
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,827
- Shut up!
- Just move, move, move!

465
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:15,956
Move!

466
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:18,493
Fuck!

467
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:22,003
No, we're never gonna get out of this place.
Don't you get it?

468
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:24,198
Wait, wait. I see a way out.

469
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:34,207
- Oh, shit.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

470
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:48,921
Go, go, go.

471
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:59,871
- Gannon. Gannon, let's rest.
- No, we gotta keep going. All right?

472
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:06,179
Get your batteries.

473
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:10,714
What's going on?

474
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:12,413
It's draining our fucking batteries.

475
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:13,750
Wait a minute. Do that again.

476
00:48:13,857 --> 00:48:16,257
- What?
- Put your head by the wall.

477
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:18,394
Pull it away.

478
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:24,122
- The cave's magnetic.
- Yeah, but not everywhere. Come on.

479
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:33,437
Come on.

480
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:41,473
Listen. If the lights flicker,
we get out of the area immediately.

481
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,917
- Okay? Okay?
- Okay.

482
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:45,953
We don't have much batteries left.

483
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:47,853
That doesn't give us much time
to get out of here.

484
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:50,290
You know it. Oh, shit.

485
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:54,421
Hey, get your vertical gear together.

486
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:56,123
If we hang like that,
we're gonna be vulnerable.

487
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:58,292
Well, if we don't hurry up...
That thing is tracking us, man.

488
00:48:58,402 --> 00:49:01,565
- What if it's waiting down there for us?
- We can't go back.

489
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:03,435
Here's a Domingo rig.

490
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,204
We got a water cave.

491
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:09,808
Water's about three feet deep.
We don't have to rappel down.

492
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:11,608
We can just swing down.

493
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:15,412
Look. We know it's back there, all right?
It's a risk we're gonna have to take.

494
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,453
How many people are you gonna leave
down there, Gannon?

495
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:19,681
- What?
- Nothing. Just go. Go!

496
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:25,295
Come on.

497
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:48,142
Hey!

498
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:53,353
Hey, guys.

499
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,520
Hey, you all right?

500
00:49:58,028 --> 00:50:01,156
- Yeah, we're fine.
- Well, let's go.

501
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:10,229
We need to talk.

502
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,830
- What?
- It's time for a change of plans.

503
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:14,001
- Let's walk and talk.
- Let's talk right here.

504
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:15,135
You're running us around in circles

505
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:16,212
and this thing's picking us off.

506
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:17,371
I'm trying to find a way out of here.

507
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:18,539
Yeah, and it keeps killing us.

508
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:19,979
- Wanna stand around and chat?
- We have guns.

509
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:21,311
- We have ammo.
- So what?

510
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:23,852
- So let's hunt this thing.
- You're crazy.

511
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:25,945
- Hear me out.
- Listen, we can barely defend ourselves,

512
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:27,751
- and you wanna go looking for it?
- Hear me out!

513
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,053
There's nothing to hear, Ori.

514
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:33,255
We have a cavern.

515
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:35,596
We use bait to lure it in.

516
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:36,791
When it goes for it,

517
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,596
we snap off all of our flashes
and we shoot the thing.

518
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,931
We unload on the son of a bitch. It'll work.

519
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,440
It'll work.

520
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:49,711
- What do you guys think?
- What if it doesn't work?

521
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:52,145
Well, then, another one of us dies anyway.

522
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:55,315
- Miranda?
- It's up to you, Gan.

523
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,923
Get your flashes.
That thing could be here any second.

524
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:08,793
Put the bait in the middle.
The rest of us hide behind the stalagmites.

525
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,628
Okay. Who's gonna be the bait?

526
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,768
- Gannon.
- Fuck you. It's your plan, you do it.

527
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:16,896
- I'm a better shot. We...
- What?

528
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:20,408
We can't afford a miss.
It's either you or the girls.

529
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:25,009
Come on,
that thing's gonna be here any second.

530
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:26,377
Fuck you.

531
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:53,803
Lights!

532
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:22,695
Can you see us?

533
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:25,966
No.

534
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:33,274
Feel like I'm the only one in here.

535
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:03,436
Look, about Rachel.

536
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:04,707
Don't do this now.

537
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:06,782
- I'm telling you what happened.
- Yeah, but not now.

538
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:09,147
My life is on the line.
You accused me of letting her die.

539
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:12,221
- Now you're gonna shut up and listen.
- Crane was there. He saw what you did.

540
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:15,553
Man, you're making this up.
I know where it's coming from.

541
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:17,358
You're still hurt.

542
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,293
She played around with you
but still loved me.

543
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:22,661
- Bullshit.
- And you fell in love

544
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:25,066
with something you couldn't have.

545
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:27,261
Bullshit. Crane was there.
He saw what you did.

546
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:30,965
Oh, yeah? And what did he tell you, huh?
What did he say?

547
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:35,477
- Don't make me say it.
- No, no. I want you to say it.

548
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:37,479
Get it out in the open.

549
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:41,478
- Spit it out.
- Gannon, please.

550
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:44,312
What? You in on this, too?

551
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:47,548
And how about you, Miranda?

552
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:50,890
Oh, my God.

553
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:54,127
Oh, my God.

554
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:57,629
We all know. Even Domingo knew.

555
00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:01,167
What's happening here?

556
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:03,935
You killed her, Gan.

557
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:07,633
You had her hand and you let her go.

558
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:12,978
<i>- Gannon! Gannon!</i>
<i>- Rachel! Hold on!</i>

559
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:16,683
- Hold on to me!
- Gannon, I'm slipping!

560
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,352
Oh, God!

561
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:55,851
Oh, God.

562
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:27,641
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

563
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:31,785
Hells, yeah!

564
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:33,589
Gannon, are you all right?

565
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:35,317
- I'm out of bullets.
- I got another mag.

566
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:37,120
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

567
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,195
- Where's it hurt?
- My leg.

568
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:41,396
My leg! Don't touch it!

569
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:45,897
It's deep. To the bone.

570
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:48,300
- Is he gonna be able to walk?
- He's gonna need help.

571
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,464
We'll take care of him later.
Let's worry about this now.

572
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:52,040
What the hell is it?

573
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:56,306
Some kind of wolf-bear hybrid,
I don't know.

574
00:56:57,981 --> 00:57:00,916
- There's no blood.
- That's not a good sign.

575
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:05,921
What the hell?

576
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:07,547
What?

577
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:17,323
This is unreal.

578
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:19,826
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

579
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,865
Go, go, go, go, go!

580
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:29,712
Run!

581
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:31,374
Come on!

582
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:34,980
Let's go! Come on!

583
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:44,219
I can't hold him much longer.

584
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:52,768
He's leaving a trail.

585
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:55,963
Damn it. Stop, stop, stop.
Set him down a sec.

586
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:57,869
You grab him from behind.

587
00:58:00,877 --> 00:58:02,367
Just... Bailey?

588
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:09,314
- We did it again.
- Did what?

589
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:11,687
We left someone behind.

590
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:15,189
- It's a bad time for guilt, Gan.
- He was still moving.

591
00:58:17,126 --> 00:58:18,616
He wasn't gonna make it.

592
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:21,526
What do you mean,
he wasn't gonna make it?

593
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:25,424
- Rachel was still moving.
- Don't do this to me, Gan.

594
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:27,594
She would've pulled both of us under.

595
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:32,202
- Hold on to me! I'm slipping!
- Pull me, Gannon!

596
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:35,106
- Get closer towards me! Kick!
- I'm trying!

597
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:38,306
- It's not working!
- Kick!

598
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:39,574
Oh, God!

599
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:45,152
Rachel! Rachel!

600
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,490
No!

601
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:51,551
Listen to me.

602
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:56,321
I don't remember if she slipped out

603
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:58,662
or if I let her go.

604
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:05,163
Would you leave me behind?

605
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:09,302
No.

606
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:15,340
Maybe we should split up.

607
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:16,776
What?

608
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:19,320
You go your way, we'll go ours.
He can't follow both of us.

609
00:59:19,422 --> 00:59:21,947
- You mean I'm slowing you down.
- No.

610
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:23,990
Yeah, that's part of it.

611
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:25,151
He's gonna be fine.

612
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:28,196
- Miranda, we left Ori.
- Ori had a spear coming out of his back.

613
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:30,630
- We couldn't help him.
- Look at him. Look at him, Miranda.

614
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,325
He's just getting worse.

615
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:34,062
The only way we have a chance
is if we leave him.

616
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:37,162
- Please, come on.
- Fuck you. I can still walk.

617
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,538
Come on and help.

618
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,605
Help me!

619
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,108
Get away from me.

620
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:48,240
Forget it. Just put your arm around me.
Come on!

621
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:51,149
- Go, go.
- Come on! Come on.

622
00:59:54,057 --> 00:59:55,115
Yes.

623
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:56,418
- Did you feel that?
- Yeah.

624
00:59:56,526 --> 00:59:58,187
- Go.
- Go, go.

625
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,068
Come on.

626
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:09,262
No! No, no, no!

627
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:12,303
- What was that?
- What the fuck?

628
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:15,410
Oh, my God. No, no.

629
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:20,744
No! No, no, no, no, no! No!

630
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:23,813
- What the fuck?
- No, no, no! No!

631
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:30,324
We're going in circles?

632
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:33,922
Bailey, I thought
you were mapping this place.

633
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:37,397
- I don't know. I don't know. I lost track.
- What do you mean, you lost track?

634
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,400
I lost track. I lost track.

635
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:42,164
I haven't been mapping anything.
I haven't been surveying anything.

636
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:44,034
Just shut up!

637
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,630
- What are we gonna do?
- All right, come on.

638
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:47,710
Come on, we'll try that hole.
We haven't been that way.

639
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:50,745
Get up and help me.
Get it together and get up!

640
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:52,480
Come on, Bailey.

641
01:00:54,884 --> 01:00:57,284
Bailey. Bailey, get up. Bailey, get up.

642
01:00:57,387 --> 01:00:59,855
- Bailey, come on!
- Come on. Come on.

643
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:02,122
Come on. Come on.

644
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:05,661
Come on.

645
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:35,115
- I don't see a way out. I don't see a way out.
- What the fuck?

646
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,349
- Let's try the opposite side.
- No, no.

647
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:38,460
Hold on!

648
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:50,639
I'm sorry.

649
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:52,675
What?

650
01:01:52,842 --> 01:01:53,831
I can't.

651
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:55,934
- What are you doing?
- I can't. I can't!

652
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:57,569
- What are you doing?
- Gannon.

653
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,375
- What?
- I can't!

654
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,547
I can't. Can't.

655
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:10,656
My batteries aren't working!
My batteries aren't working!

656
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,387
Mine are all dead.

657
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,189
Try your flashes.

658
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:19,001
Fuck!

659
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:22,734
Mine won't work. They won't work.

660
01:02:36,819 --> 01:02:37,808
No!

661
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:41,956
Oh, my God, you guys. Oh, my God.
Did you hear that?

662
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:44,185
- What?
- It's fucking in here.

663
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:46,560
- Where?
- On the right.

664
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,124
Oh, no!

665
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,258
It's a wall. It's a wall.

666
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:56,065
- Which way?
- Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

667
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:58,473
Okay, there's a tunnel.
Right here, there's a tunnel.

668
01:02:58,574 --> 01:03:00,269
Go, go, go.

669
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:06,144
Gannon?

670
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:08,644
Gannon!

671
01:03:34,677 --> 01:03:35,871
Come on.

672
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:40,907
Okay.

673
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:47,456
Come on.

674
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:53,928
Go, go, go, go, go. Go.

675
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:06,141
Right here.

676
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:07,774
I can't see.

677
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:21,256
Good.

678
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:24,887
- Our lights. Our lights.
- Our lights.

679
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:29,055
There must be some power left in them,
just not enough for that cave.

680
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:32,500
- Oh, my God.
- What? What?

681
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:36,433
- What?
- He's gone.

682
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:40,506
- I left him there. I left him there.
- I know.

683
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:42,441
- We had to. Okay? We had to.
- I left him there.

684
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:45,537
- I left him there. Gannon's gone.
- We don't know that.

685
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:47,115
He might've gotten out, too. Right?

686
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:49,411
Please just say it with me.
He might've gotten out, too.

687
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:51,179
- Okay?
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

688
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,517
It's okay. Calm down.
Breathe! Listen, breathe.

689
01:04:56,525 --> 01:04:59,653
We're almost there. All right? All right?
We're almost out. Okay?

690
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:01,525
It's okay.

691
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:06,201
My God.

692
01:05:06,435 --> 01:05:08,062
What? What? What?

693
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:12,066
- A leaf.
- What?

694
01:05:12,942 --> 01:05:14,671
Oh, God. Oh, daylight.

695
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:16,870
- Daylight!
- Is that what I think it is?

696
01:05:16,979 --> 01:05:19,641
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That's daylight.

697
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:22,741
- Daylight! Oh, my God!
- Yes! Yes!

698
01:05:23,352 --> 01:05:25,013
- Yes!
- Daylight, daylight, daylight!

699
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:26,520
We're gonna go home again.

700
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:28,817
Oh, my God. Daylight. Daylight.

701
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:31,750
Oh, my God!

702
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:50,576
I see the surface. Bailey, I see the surface.
Bailey, I see the surface!

703
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:53,740
Oh, I see it! I see it. Oh, my God!

704
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:55,944
- Hold on. Oh, God.
- Almost there!

705
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:57,849
- Bailey. Bailey.
- My foot's caught on something.

706
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,683
What's it caught on?

707
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:06,054
No! No!

708
01:06:08,597 --> 01:06:12,795
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

709
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:36,349
Bailey! Bailey, wake up! Bailey!

710
01:07:38,854 --> 01:07:41,880
- Oh, my God. What happened?
- I don't know. I don't know.

711
01:07:42,425 --> 01:07:43,653
Oh, God.

712
01:07:45,194 --> 01:07:47,185
- What happened?
- I don't know.

713
01:07:47,296 --> 01:07:49,025
- Where are we?
- We gotta get out of here.

714
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:51,599
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God, we gotta get out of here.

715
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:55,762
There's a door. Come on. Miranda, come on.

716
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,437
Come on. Come on.

717
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:04,545
- Okay.
- Come on. Come on.

718
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:06,114
One, two, three.

719
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:11,211
It won't open! Bailey, it won't open!

720
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:14,221
- Let us out of here!
- Bailey! Bailey!

721
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:16,257
Bailey, it's not moving.

722
01:08:20,796 --> 01:08:24,095
Look. It's all our stuff.

723
01:08:42,151 --> 01:08:43,846
It's not all ours.

724
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:07,773
It's a wing of a plane.

725
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:01,687
Bailey, there's pictures.

726
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:16,443
Is that the same plane?

727
01:10:25,154 --> 01:10:26,746
It got them, too.

728
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:45,066
"Petr."

729
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:49,476
- Russian?
- Yeah.

730
01:10:51,447 --> 01:10:53,312
He would have been 24.

731
01:11:02,358 --> 01:11:04,451
Water. Water, come on.

732
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:05,925
Oh, God.

733
01:11:23,812 --> 01:11:25,302
This is mine.

734
01:11:42,998 --> 01:11:43,965
Oh, my God!

735
01:12:58,307 --> 01:13:00,036
God, help me!

736
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:19,514
Petr?

737
01:14:22,324 --> 01:14:24,019
You like your name.

738
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:37,070
- He doesn't care.
- We're reaching him.

739
01:14:38,073 --> 01:14:40,507
- You can't.
- We have to try.

740
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:43,508
What's wrong? What's wrong?

741
01:14:43,612 --> 01:14:45,773
Petr, what's wrong?

742
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:52,446
No! No! No! No! My God!

743
01:14:53,388 --> 01:14:55,879
- Say his name. Say his name.
- It's not gonna work.

744
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:59,518
- Petr! Petr!
- It doesn't care! It doesn't understand!

745
01:14:59,628 --> 01:15:01,323
It's not human!

746
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:07,996
Oh, my God!
