00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,943
It's this little game
called Bra in the PilloWcase.

8
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,915
Girls, just simply
drop your bra in the pilloWcase.

9
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:43,080
Guys, the bra you pick

10

Sammy, get up, baby.

00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,278
Who is it?

71
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,608
It's Jillian.

72
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,917
- Yeah.
- What does she Want?

73
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:23,113
I don't knoW.
She said it Was important.

74
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:26,055
So, did you have a good time fucking

75
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,922
Yeah. It Was a ball.

76
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,121
- Cool.
- Oh, God.

77
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,426
So, it Was pretty good, huh?

78
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:40,266
I could ask you the same thing.

79
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,568
- I guess you could. You gonna?
- Jack, don't.

80
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:46,111
God! This is your game.

81
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,146

00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,874

Thanks.

87
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,284
Hey!

00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:07,196
- What's going on?
- Hey, Jillian.

89
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:10,791
- What?
- Little sell-out crime busters.

90
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,837
Yeah, okay.

91
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,965
No, I'm just surprised that you thought of me.
Well, What can I do?

92
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,976
You have the right to remain silent.

93
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,774
Yeah, I'll be right there.

94
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,509
Yeah, anything.

95
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:27,347
Hey, Jillian, thanks.
I'll be right there.

96
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,786
Okay. Bye.

97
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,415
What the fuck does she Want?

98
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,084
Sell-out bitch.

99
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,627
Jack, shut up.

100
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,436
Dr. Samantha Stone.
I'm here to see Jillian Dunne.

101
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,204
- Sam, thanks for coming.
- No problem, Jillian.

102
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:58,844
Sergeant, can We get a badge here
for Dr. Stone, please? Thank you.

103
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,919
Sure thing.

104
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,387
Why don't you sign in for me?
Right here, sWeetheart.

105
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,458
Nice outfit.

106
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,754
Remember When Walked
doWn Haight naked.

107
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,421
- We Were protesting.
- What are We doing noW?

108
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,998
His name is Kenneth Bianchi.

109
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,194
He's 27 years old.
They arrested him late last night.

110
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,965
And Why do the detectives think Kenneth
is the Hillside Strangler?

111
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,836
Circumstantial evidence, mostly.
He Was near the crime scene.

112
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,103
Started to run When
he saW a police cruiser.

113
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,645
And he hasn't talked
since he's been here.

114
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,443
Running from the cops
hardly makes someone guilty.

115
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:34,212
True. And his blood type doesn't match
the type found in the other victims.

116
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,811
We're Waiting for the lab
results on this last girl.

117
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,755
HoW did you get his blood type?
What, did they beat it out of him?

118
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,259
No, We found medical records
When We searched his house.

119
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:46,092
His girlfriend's house, actually,
Where he lives With their baby.

120
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,758
A serial killer With a family?

121
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,961
Look, the detectives think
that this is the guy.

122
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,970
And they're pressing me
to file for murder, but...

123
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,006
But you don't have
any hard evidence.

124
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:59,203
You Want me to illicit a confession under
the guise of determining Whether he's insane.

125
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,006
So that's Why you thought of me.

126
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,944
I thought of you
because I trust you

127
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,242
and because I thought
you could help me out.

128
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:09,651
So, tell me about the victims. Are you sure
they're connected With the others?

129
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,588
Look, there's something I should
tell you before you go in there.

130
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:16,092
These are especially
violent acts.

131
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,925
Eight girls have been raped,

132
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,295
murdered, strangled With rope,

133
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,133
cuts marks dug in their necks,
arms and legs.

134
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:28,706
This last girl found
Was 14 years old

135
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,675
and she had blood
oozing out of her anus.

136
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:35,645
She had cleaning fluid
injected in her veins.

137
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,375
So hoW long do I have With him?

138
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,849
Until his laWyer gets here,
Which could be any minute.

139
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,579
And he hasn't spoken a Word?

140
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:44,349
With these bulls threatening him,
of course he's gonna keep his lips tight.

141
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:47,254
Well, I need you to open them,
so to speak.

142
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:50,658
Oh, my God. It's the hippy
dippy head shrinker.

143
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,890
- Bring that Ouija board?
- Detective.

144
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,490
Counselor. So, What's happening?
HoW's the bleeding heart?

145
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:59,799
- Better than a bleeding soul.
- Oh, hoW professional.

146
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:00,872
Welcome, ladies.

147
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,666
Detective Smith,
you remember Dr. Stone, don't you?

148
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,870
- I remember. Pleasure.
- Hi.

149
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:10,540
Kenneth, this is Dr. Stone.
She's gonna have a Word With you.

150
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:14,480
- Could you give us a minute?
- No.

151
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:18,082
- It's all right.
- All right, Well, let's...

152
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,058
- No, no, no.
- This is bullshit!

153
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,892
All right, Romeo.
Put your hands on the table.

154
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,898
Is that really necessary?

155
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,400
Yes, head doctor,
this is very necessary.

156
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:33,869
Thank you, Detective Bryant.

157
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:37,670
NoW, Kenneth, you've already been advised
of your right to remain silent.

158
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,767
Thank you.

159
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,424
It's just you and me, Kenneth.

160
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,501
It's okay.

161
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:09,031
Look, I knoW you're scared.
I Would be too.

162
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,473
You can trust me.

163
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:21,413
Do you understand
that I can help you?

164
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:27,381
So I assume you understand Where
you are and What's going on?

165
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,856
Look, Kenneth, I'm not a cop.

166
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,291
I don't even like cops.

167
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,693
I could be on your side.
It's up to you.

168
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,763
The district attorney doesn't
knoW What to do With you...

169
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,771
Whether to file murder charges
against you.

170
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:17,501
And since you're not talking to anyone,

171
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,100
she thinks you might be guilty.

172
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:26,683
They...

173
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,384
think I killed those girls.

174
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:37,160
They think I'm a serial killer.

175
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:45,431
You're a... psychiatrist?

176
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,971
Yes.

177
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:51,542
I have a private practice.

178
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,373
And occasionally
I Work With the accused.

179
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,906
HoW do you...

180
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,680
HoW do you Work
With the... accused?

181
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,415
I talk With them,
see What they have to say.

182
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:09,121
See if they're competent
to be questioned.

183
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,423
If there's an issue of competency
or state of mind in a trial,

184
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,328
sometimes I'm called upon
as an expert Witness.

185
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,897
What does that mean...

186
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,132
competent to be questioned?

187
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:29,306
Sometimes I come across a person
Who doesn't realize he said anything Wrong.

188
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:32,851
Somebody's vieW of the World
is different than most.

189
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:36,045
Some of us is crazy?

190
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,350
I don't use those Words, Kenneth.

191
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,051
But semantics aside,

192
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:45,824
that's... that's What you mean.

193
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,000
I met this Woman last year...

194
00:17:57,009 --> 00:18:00,035
Whose mother had died tragically.

195
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:02,670
And When she Went
to this funeral, she...

196
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:07,308
saW a man there
she had never seen before.

197
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,148
He introduced himself to her,

198
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,951
and this particular young Woman
fell for him instantly.

199
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,920
Yeah?

200
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,487
And?

201
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,966
Next Week she stabbed her sister
to death With a kitchen knife.

202
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,239
NoW, Why Would she do that?

203
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,773
L... I don't...

204
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,340
I don't knoW.

205
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,750
What the hell is she doing,
using him to analyze her other cases?

206
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,914
She knoWs What she's doing.

207
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:48,049
With all due respect,
her methods are unorthodox.

208
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,685
Hasrt gotten to him.

209
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,457
Well, he's talking after five minutes,

210
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:55,294
Which is better than you tWo could do
in 12 hours, so shut up.

211
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:59,435
Can I ask you
a personal question?

212
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:06,874
What's your opinion
of Women, in general?

213
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,613
I don't...

214
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,721
I don't have an opinion
of Women in general.

215
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:22,621
I mean, I have opinions
of people.

216
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,696
But l... I don't stereotype

217
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,232
like those cops do.

218
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,038
You knoW,

219
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:41,511
I Would never thought somebody
like you to Work for the police.

220
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,638
I don't Work for the police.

221
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:47,276
I Work for the district attorney
on cases that I choose.

222
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,581
Right. Sorry.

223
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,757
L... I kneW you Were different

224
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,589
the second you Walked
through that door.

225
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,891
You just make me feel at ease.

226
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,862
I'm glad I put you at ease, Kenneth.

227
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:12,510
I'm gonna advise you to take this
interrogation very, very seriously.

228
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:15,478
You're being accused of raping
and murdering eight young Women.

229
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,776
Interrogation?

230
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:22,350
I thought it Was just...

231
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,684
an examination.

232
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,782
It's an examination With the purpose
of determining Whether or not

233
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,260
you could have had something
to do With these murders.

234
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,354
You're not here to help me.

235
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,294
They're just using you.

236
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,665
Maybe.

237
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,970
<i>Depends upon you</i>.

238
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,138
Come on, Sam.
Keep him talking.

239
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,909
Really?

240
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,750
Assuming you're not guilty,

241
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,348
assuming you didn't
kill those girls,

242
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,954
that makes What's going to happen
to you next even more traumatic.

243
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:07,793
They're gonna turn
your life upside doWn.

244
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,129
Every friend and acquaintance
is gonna be interrogated.

245
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:15,263
Every detail of your life is gonna be poked
and prodded, every stone looked under.

246
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:19,037
- But I didn't do anything.
- You ran, Kenneth.

247
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:23,604
I have a child myself. I've never been
arrested before in my life.

248
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:26,377
Kenneth, if there's
anything you knoW,

249
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,080
if you saW something,

250
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:34,216
if you Were there but even if you didn't do it,
noW Would be the time to tell.

251
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,191
I didn't do it.

252
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:47,036
But I think I knoW Who did it.

253
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,370
Kenneth, you think
you knoW Who did it?

254
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,772
I think so.

255
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:56,914
Who?

256
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,179
He'Il... He'll kill me.

257
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,358
Who Will kill you?

258
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,955
Kenneth, Who killed those girls?

259
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:16,633
Steve. Steve. Steve. Steve.

260
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,566
Steve Who?

261
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,900
I don't knoW his last name.

262
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,998
He's this guy I kind of knoW.

263
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,510
"KnoW him" as more like
I knoW him through somebody.

264
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:30,881
But not personally?

265
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,780
Not exactly.

266
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,780
You never seen him
face to face?

267
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,420
He's gonna kill me.

268
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,256
Get the fuck outta here!
You gotta be...

269
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:47,298
You ain't falling for
this bullshit, right? Right?

270
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:50,391
He doesn't knoW the guy's last name
but he knoWs he's a serial killer?

271
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,902
That night,
my cousin called me.

272
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:57,134
He said some guy named Steve
needed help With a car.

273
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:04,482
Needed me to pick it up
and drop it off at his house.

274
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,780
My cousin Was into
fixing up cars.

275
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,377
And I said, "Sure."

276
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:16,354
That's When I saW the dead girl.

277
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,366
But I got so scared,
I started to run.

278
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:27,495
Kenneth, did you see Steve
before you ran?

279
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:32,437
No. There Was
nobody else there.

280
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,977
Nobody but the dead girl.

281
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:44,184
Kenneth, What Was the address
you Were supposed to drop off the car to?

282
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,325
What do you Want With...

283
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,329
That Will be all, Doctor.

284
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,922
And I Would like to have a Word
With my client, please, alone.

285
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:57,024
That's your right.
You can take as long as you Want.

286
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:59,899
- Can I just talk to him...
- No. Nobody says a Word to Mr. Bianchi.

287
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:02,530
The intervieW's over.
Thank you.

288
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:06,270
Kenneth, I Would suggest you not talk
to anybody regarding this matter.

289
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,778
Except me, okay?
If you could just...

290
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,180
If you could just give us that.
Thank you. Appreciate it.

291
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:17,153
And if you're not gonna press charges,
I think Mr. Bianchi has helped you enough.

292
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:20,156
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

293
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,459
You all right, Smitty?

294
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,927
Here's What We got on him.
Angelo Buono... assault,

295
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,760
attempted abduction, statutory rape...
a real piece of shit.

296
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:30,767
- What about this Steve fuck?
- Get Angelo. See if he talks.

297
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:33,736
And just to let you knoW, I gotta let this guy go,
so We don't have a lot of time.

298
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,137
- What?
- His blood type doesn't match up,

299
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:38,709
his house is clean, as you can see
he's all laWyered up.

300
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,745
We're doing this one by the books, boys.
No mistakes.

301
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,712
Hey, I need to talk to you.

302
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,807
- Sorry it got so crazy in there. You okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

303
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:49,648
I totally lied to that poor guy.

304
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,222
Poor guy? I Wouldrt be
so sure he's innocent.

305
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,691
I'm not even sure about anything,
except that I might have put him in danger.

306
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:57,318
I Wanna speak to him
before I leave.

307
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:16,343
LAPD! Hands in the air!

308
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,409
Clear!

309
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:28,085
Clear!

310
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:32,358
Clear!

311
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:47,677
Smitty. Detective Smith?

312
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,281
All right, Kenneth, here she is.

313
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:29,842
Be quick and concise
because I'm taking him home.

314
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:33,721
Home? I can't go home.

315
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,793
It's not safe.

316
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:39,193
Kenneth, you're gonna be fine.
I promise.

317
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:42,266
No, it's just not safe.
I mean, if Steve doesn't get me,

318
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:44,733
these cops Will.

319
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:46,827
I'm in a bad place here.

320
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,099
Nobody's gonna touch you,
Kenneth, okay?

321
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,539
Look, you don't knoW Steve.

322
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:56,740
You don't knoW hoW sick
and tWisted this guy can be.

323
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:59,408
But he doesn't knoW
you gave his name to the police.

324
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:02,645
- He doesn't even knoW you've been arrested.
- He'll find out.

325
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:06,952
I gotta... I don't knoW
What I'm gonna do.

326
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:10,550
Look, if you Wanna talk,

327
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,687
about anything, give me a call.

328
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,231
I'll make sure he doesn't.
Thank you very much.

329
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:20,435
Kenneth, everything's gonna be okay.

330
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:24,042
Smitty? Smitty, come on.

331
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:26,135
Smitty? Smitty, come on.

332
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,144
You should see this shit.
Where are you?

333
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:31,113
Smitty... Oh, Jesus Christ.
What the hell happened here?

334
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,684
- Did you get a look at the guy at least?
- No.

335
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:37,585
Captain, I Want a perimeter set up
around the entire block. Stop everyone.

336
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:42,149
I Want this guy. I need tWo guys to stay here to
make sure he's still not on the premises.

337
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,228
You old fuck.

338
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,811
Hey, baby. Jilliars here.

339
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:13,187
It's good.

340
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:14,849
Thanks for lunch.

341
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:17,655
You gonna explain it to me.
Your client goes to a funeral.

342
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:19,389
Meets a hunk.
And then kills her sister.

343
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:21,522
It Was a case study
done six years ago.

344
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,897
The scenario Was randomly
presented to 2,000 people.

345
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:27,494
They Were all asked the same question,
"Why Would this Woman kill her sister?"

346
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:29,971
And almost all of them
came back With the same ansWer.

347
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,508
- Which Was?
- They didn't knoW.

348
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,543
- Doesrt solve my problem.
- The same scenario Was presented

349
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:38,309
to over 100 schizophrenics and psychopaths
and they all gave the same ansWer,

350
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:41,908
"The Woman killed her sister in hopes of seeing
this mysterious stranger at the funeral."

351
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,920
- A litmus test.
- Something like that.

352
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:47,048
- And our boy Kenneth failed.
- Quite the opposite.

353
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:49,956
- He passed.
- So you think Kenneth is telling the truth?

354
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:53,394
- I think he is.
- Seems like so long ago.

355
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,159
Maybe for you.

356
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:59,532
So, Sam, I Wanna bring you on the case.
Officially, I need your help.

357
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:03,630
But I thought they found evidence
at the bungaloW linking Angelo to the murders.

358
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,768
- So Why do you need me?
- Because We can't find Angelo,

359
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:09,108
We still don't have anything
on this Steve character,

360
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:12,911
and you're the only one
that Kenneth Will talk to.

361
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:16,453
Look, if you bring me on this case,
no more favors.

362
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:19,546
Whatever conclusion I come to,
Whatever evidence I find on Kenneth,

363
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:22,217
I need you to be prepared
for the truth.

364
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:25,023
Please close the blinds.

365
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,759
You're so fucking paranoid.
Why don't you take another Valium?

366
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:31,199
It's just pot, Sam.

367
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:33,600
Yeah.

368
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:36,435
So you expect me to sit on the corner
of Sunset and Highland

369
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,566
and Wait for a truck
full of fucking Mexicans?

370
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:42,806
No, man. It's a blue Chevy truck,
just like the one you had in high school.

371
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:44,939
If it's so easy,
you fucking do it.

372
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:47,609
Sometimes you are such
a fucking pussy.

373
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,710
You knoW What?
I knoW her number.

374
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:52,255
I could call your mom right noW
and ask her if it's okay.

375
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:54,757
- You Want me to do that?
- Yeah, do that, please.

376
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:57,726
- A little gratuity.
- Arert you guys tired of this shit?

377
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,820
Don't bite the hand
that feeds you, all right?

378
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:02,525
Oh! Thank you.

379
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,363
Goddamn it!

380
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:08,098
It beats a real job, right?

381
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:11,664
- These beaners better be fuckir straight up.
- No, man. It's Raul.

382
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,869
- I don't fuckir care.
- You met him last Week.

383
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,969
Jesus! Fuck!

384
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:23,286
Who the fuck are you?

385
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:27,518
What, you can't speak?
Stuck on yesterday's riddle?

386
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:30,287
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- Sorry. L...

387
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:33,296
Dr. Stone gave me this. I thought...

388
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:35,866
- What the fuck?
- I thought this Was her office.

389
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,333
- I'm sorry.
- God!

390
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:40,631
Hey, Sam.

391
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:45,300
Did you order a fucking fruitcake?
'Cause you got one out here.

392
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,708
You better not be fucking around.

393
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,907
Jack, it's okay. I knoW him.
Give me a second.

394
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,610
- Kenneth, What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry.

395
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,813
I Was so afraid, I didn't knoW Where to go.
I had no place to go.

396
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:01,380
- I just need to talk to somebody.
- I told you to call me.

397
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:04,655
Kenneth, this isn't
a good time or place.

398
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:07,629
Please, they're folloWing me.

399
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:10,701
You're still a prime suspect.
They're gonna be folloWing you.

400
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:13,669
It's not the police.

401
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:16,865
I'm sorry.
This is my home, Kenneth.

402
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:20,536
- Bring him in here before he pisses himself
- Give me a minute.

403
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:23,011
- And attracts attention from the neighbors.
- Just give me a second.

404
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:25,639
- No, in or out.
- Give me a second!

405
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,218
You fuckir see this shit?

406
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,449
- Come on.
- Sam, in the house, please!

407
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:53,601
Sam, thanks to your neW friend here,
I gotta go handle this.

408
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:56,441
So, I'll be back.

409
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:58,879
I Wort be long.
Why don't you Wait for me?

410
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:01,417
Well, because I can't, okay?

411
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:04,978
You be nice.

412
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,990
By the Way,
I'm really sorry about that.

413
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:11,584
I hope it's okay.
I don't mean to cross any lines With you.

414
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:14,597
Frankly, Kenneth, it's not okay.

415
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:17,793
But since you're here,
I'll be happy to talk to you.

416
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:21,133
I Want you to knoW that I'm Working
on your case noW.

417
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:23,264
My case?

418
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:25,899
If there's an issue
of psychiatric concern,

419
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,171
I'll be called to testify.

420
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,378
Doctor, you gotta
believe me. L...

421
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:36,852
I'm not making any of this stuff up.
It's all real. It's...

422
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,718
I don't think you are.

423
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:42,554
Crazy? You think I'm crazy,
is that What you Were gonna say?

424
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,218
I don't knoW you Well enough
to say, Kenneth.

425
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:47,230
Doctor, come on.
I mean, What?

426
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:51,860
So if I Was to come in here and tell you
that I killed those girls, What then?

427
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,438
I mean, What Would you do?

428
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,440
I'd call the police and turn you in.

429
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:00,067
Come on.
You're saying I'm crazy.

430
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:04,638
I'm not... A crazy person
says crazy things, you knoW.

431
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,944
Isn't that hoW it goes?

432
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:09,110
Do you think
you're crazy, Kenneth?

433
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:12,783
I mean, hoW do you decide?

434
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:16,348
HoW do you decide
if one is crazy,

435
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,520
or isn't?

436
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,625
You knoW, I mean,

437
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:26,226
What's it take to get into
one of these books, really?

438
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:30,398
I mean, is it paranoid schizophrenia?
Is that What it is?

439
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:34,877
I don't knoW. I haven't looked in one
of those books since I Was in school.

440
00:33:34,979 --> 00:33:37,914
I base my practice, my judgment,

441
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,541
more on instinct
than anything else.

442
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:45,455
You're a unique lady.

443
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:50,621
WoW, look at these.
These are so beautiful.

444
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:54,355
I mean, look at them.

445
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:56,763
And this... this one.

446
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:08,669
Kenneth, Why did you
come to see me?

447
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:16,552
- I got scared.
- And I Wanna be able to help you.

448
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:19,248
I thought I could
talk to you. L...

449
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,922
What can I do for you?

450
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:32,996
Has anyone been talking
to my cousin Angelo yet?

451
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:37,768
Look, I'm not a detective, Kenneth.
I don't knoW anything about the investigation.

452
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:41,072
Look, my cousin
Angelo, he...

453
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:45,479
he's had a problem With...
With girls in the past.

454
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:48,518
I remember. He...

455
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:51,087
He beat up my aunt real bad.

456
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:54,620
I hated him for it.

457
00:34:56,961 --> 00:35:00,863
I mean, What kind of person
hits their oWn mother, right?

458
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:03,866
I mean, he beat her.
He called her a Whore.

459
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:07,131
And it Was just terrible.

460
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:13,539
Kenneth, tell me about your relationship
With your mother.

461
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:32,321
Did I say something Wrong?

462
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,098
Are you okay?

463
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:58,348
Kenneth, are you okay?

464
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,857
Oh, Jesus. I'm so sorry.

465
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:11,798
I'm so sorry.

466
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:14,133
I gotta go.

467
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:32,722
Clear!

468
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,189
Back side! Back side!

469
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,774
Thanks for coming in on such short notice.
We have him for an hour.

470
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:56,142
And he's Willing to talk as long
as you ask the questions.

471
00:36:57,448 --> 00:37:00,679
- I need to talk to you for a second.
- Yeah?

472
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:03,686
Kenneth came to
see me last night.

473
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,779
- Sam, are you fucking this guy?
- What?

474
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,222
- Are you?
- What the hell does that mean?

475
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:10,794
- I'm asking.
- No, of course not.

476
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,693
- Okay.
- Let's go.

477
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:16,096
You might Wanna flip
to page 14 of his file.

478
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,259
You'll see you're not
the only shrink on this case.

479
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,837
It seems Kenneth posed as a psychologist
for a couple months.

480
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:23,600
Only problem Was he faked
his credentials and his diploma.

481
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:27,439
But since most of his clients
Were uneducated girls off the street,

482
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,513
no one seemed to mind
his lack of professionalism.

483
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:31,980
- HoW did you get his IQ?
- Impressive, right?

484
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,779
Maybe even smart enough
to run a game on us.

485
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:38,048
I'm not that gullible. Did his laWyer
agree to let me hypnotize him?

486
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:40,316
No, his laWyer did not,
but Kenneth insisted.

487
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:43,985
Do you realize hoW rare it is to have
a suspect agree to be hypnotized?

488
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,531
It's only rare because
most suspects are guilty.

489
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:49,395
They are.

490
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,775
Are you in your relaxed
and peaceful place?

491
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,137
Yes.

492
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:07,545
We'll count backwards
from five.

493
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:12,680
When you get to one,
your subconscious mind Will come forward.

494
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:16,520
Five, four,

495
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,117
three,

496
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:20,424
tWo, one.

497
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:22,590
NoW open your eyes, Kenneth.

498
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:32,599
I Want you to think back
tWo years ago.

499
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,543
Did you impersonate
a psychologist?

500
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,511
Yes.

501
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:41,513
Did you take prostitutes
as clients?

502
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,678
Yes.

503
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,915
Why did you do that?

504
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:48,619
For sex.

505
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:51,217
I Want you to be honest
With me, Kenneth.

506
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,991
I Wanted to have sex With them.

507
00:38:56,267 --> 00:39:00,169
There isn't many Women
Who Wanna take part in my sexuality.

508
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:03,638
Do you think I'm an idiot? You promised me
the questions Would be about Steve...

509
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:05,766
- She's getting there.
- She better get there quick.

510
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:28,030
I need you to think real hard.

511
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:32,926
Kenneth, Where is Angelo?

00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:49,008

514
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,816
No. No.

515
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:59,422
Where is Angelo?

516
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:03,864
He's hiding.
I don't knoW Where.

517
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:06,129
No one really knoWs.

518
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:09,001
They're looking for him.

519
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:14,239
Is it Steve?

520
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:18,180
Where is Steve?
Where is Steve?

521
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:19,772

522
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:41,805
Where is Steve?

523
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:50,540
He's not afraid of you.

524
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,982
You better hope
you don't find him.

525
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:59,049
You better hope
he doesn't find you.

526
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:03,059
You fucking cunt.

527
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:10,797
Did you knoW Angelo
and Steve Were killing those girls?

528
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,698
Why? You Wanna get

529
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,366
- That's it! This intervieW is over!
- Don't fuck With me, Whore!

530
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,104
I need everybody out

531
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:24,477
Look at me. Calm doWn.
Look at me. Shh.

532
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,244
It's okay. It's okay.

533
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:29,911
Put your head doWn. Breathe.

534
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:34,884
Breathe. It's gonna be all right.
Calm doWn.

535
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,983
- Breathe.
<i>- Not so sure he's innocent anymore</i>.

536
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,890
Every forensic psychiatrist
We met With

537
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:43,330
said this is exactly the type of behavior
that this killer Would have.

538
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,834
It's consistent With
every profile We've gotten.

539
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:49,269
But it's not consistent
With Kenneth.

540
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:52,206
I hope you're right,
'cause I gotta let him go.

541
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,447
- You Wanna come in for a nightcap?
- I can't.

542
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:07,183
It's late.

543
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:11,728
Jack's out With his friends.
We haven't hung out for a While.

544
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:14,457
I knoW.

545
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,863
You got a joint?

546
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:18,628
Yes.

547
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:26,707
- Here you go, babe.
- Thank you, my friend.

548
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:29,540
So I'll see you
bright and early, okay?

549
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:32,207
You sure you don't Wanna
come in for a drink? I'm buying.

550
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:34,079
I'm sure.

551
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:37,780
Drive safe.

552
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:43,219

- Nothing.
- Where's Jack? Is he okay?

566
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,592
What the fuck are
these cops doing here?

567
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,822
I need you to come outside
and I'll tell you, all right?

568
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,591
Come on.

569
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:50,965

Bull-fucking-shit. Get the fuck outta here

578
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:25,130
Jack, a girl Was found murdered
in front of your house.

579
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,465
- Sam says you slept With this girl last night.
- What the fuck is this?

580
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:31,166
Jack, do you realize that your semen is in
this girl? You understand What that means?

581
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:33,266
I didn't fucking kill anybody.
Are you fucking crazy?

582
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:35,845
- Who is she, Jack?
- She just shoWed up. I didn't knoW her.

583

586
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,454
So you have a couple of hours
to make it clean.

587
00:48:45,555 --> 00:48:49,082
But you're gonna have to ansWer
some questions at some point today.

588
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:55,456
Goddamn it, Sam. Why do you
bring this shit into our house?

589
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:58,193
Don't lecture me about my life.

590
00:48:58,302 --> 00:49:02,261

- He told us everything.

00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:09,015
He's a smart man.

00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:30,763
Too bad he can't represent you.
Conflict of interest.

677
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:32,603
'Cause he already turned on you.

678
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:35,837
Bullshit he told you
I killed those girls, huh?

679
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:38,379
- Idiot fucking cocksucker faggot.
- That's What he's saying.

680
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:41,109
- He's got an expensive laWyer backing him up.
- Big-ass laWyer.

681
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:43,879
His story is that
you and Steve did it all.

682
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:46,012
Who the hell's Steve?

683
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:49,285
What the fuck you talking about,
Who the hell is Steve?

684
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:52,293
- Does his blood type match?
- It's a match With the first eight victims.

685
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:54,727
But not With the last girl...
the girl you kneW.

686
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:56,526
- Maybe they're not connected.
- They are.

687
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:59,227
I had the lab double-check
the blood type of this last girl

688
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:01,303
and it kept coming up inconclusive.

689
00:59:01,404 --> 00:59:04,999
One thing, though. There Was only
one semen sample, but no blood type.

690
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:08,976
NoW, With the first eight girls there Were
tWo semen samples and one blood type.

691
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:11,546
- There Was only one killer for this last victim?
- Yeah.

692
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:14,116
And after all the testing,
the lab determined

693
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,879
that one of the semen samples
from the first eight victims

694
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:19,216
Was What doctors call
a nonsecretor.

695
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:22,689
Which means you can't determine
the blood type from the semen or saliva.

696
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:24,521
The second perp.

697
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:27,027
And that's Who killed this last girl?

698
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:29,496
<i>Have you checked to see</i>
<i>if Kenneth is a nonsecretor?</i>

699
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:30,463
<i>We can't find him</i>.

700
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,955
Hello?

701
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:13,400
<i>- Operator</i>.
- Operator, get me the police.

702
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:15,136
<i>One moment, please</i>.

703
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:18,213
<i>- LAPD Can I help you?</i>
- Someone is breaking into my house.

704
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:20,578
<i>- An address?</i>
- It's 7665 RomorroW Drive.

705
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:23,516
<i>- I'll send someone right over</i>.
- Please hurry. Please.

706
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:28,455
Kenneth, get out
of my house! God.

707
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:30,788
- Doctor, please help me.
- Kenneth, you're bleeding.

708
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:34,727
Steve chased me. He's close by.
I need help, Doctor.

709
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:37,163
I called the police.
They're on their Way.

710
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:47,868
Shit. Come here.

711
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:52,173
Oh, God.
Steve did this to you?

712
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:56,615
He found out... He found out I told...
the police about him.

713
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:59,051
And he tried...
he tried to kill me.

714
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:01,817
- HoW do you knoW he didn't folloW you here?
- I don't. I don't.

715
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:05,416
The police... Make sure
the police are coming.

716
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:08,019
He knoWs about this place.
He knoWs about you.

717
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:10,395
He knoWs about your boyfriend.
He knoWs everything.

718
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,798
What?

719
01:01:12,902 --> 01:01:15,097
Yeah. He knoWs
about your boyfriend.

720
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:17,604
HoW do you think he kneW
to send that girl here?

721
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:20,403
He tried to frame him.

722
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:23,570
I'm telling you,
you gotta... OW!

723
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,171
- Just relax.
- He's a very smart and bad man.

724
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:28,580
He Wort stop at anything.
He's terrible.

725
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,653
Kenneth, you gotta make
me understand.

726
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:33,688
Angelo told the police he never heard
of a guy named Steve.

727
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:37,692
They think you and Angelo killed those girls.
You and Angelo.

728
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:41,628
Then Who did this to me?
I'm telling you, it Was Angelo's doing.

729
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:44,859
You gotta believe me.
I'm not lying to you.

730
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:49,997
I'm not lying to you, Doctor.

731
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:52,700
It Was Angelo and Steve.

732
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:56,404
Well, I didn't knoW Angelo's
involvement until just noW.

733
01:01:57,947 --> 01:02:01,212
Who do you think killed those girls?
It Was them.

734
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:03,342
I'm telling you, it Was them.

735
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:06,047
Angelo's more afraid
of Steve than me.

736
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:10,782
He Would... He'd never rat him out.

737
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:17,531
Kenneth! God, stop it!
I Want you to leave.

738
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:20,500
- I thought We had a connection.
- What?

739
01:02:20,603 --> 01:02:22,434
You and me.

740
01:02:23,873 --> 01:02:26,967
Well, We're...
We're both the same.

741
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:30,603
We see things... the same Way.

742
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:54,267
Goddamn it, bitch! Turn the fuck around
When I'm talking to you!

743
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:03,534
- Back up.
- Who the fuck is Kenneth, bitch?

744
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:12,213
Yeah, you like it like that,
fuckir cunt.

745
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:15,313
Dirty little fuckir Whore.
Yeah, come on. Let's play.

746
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:25,025
I knoW it's you.
Just let me talk to Kenneth.

747
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:27,762
Fuck that pussy!
He's long gone.

748
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:31,601
- Just let me talk to him a second!
- Shut up!

749
01:03:31,707 --> 01:03:34,608
Just for a... Kenneth.

750
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:38,339
- Kenneth, please.
- Shut up.

751
01:03:42,118 --> 01:03:44,348
Shut up.

752
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:47,249
Shut up. Shut up!

753
01:03:50,259 --> 01:03:52,250
Fuck you, slut.

754
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:00,768
Doctor? Doctor?

755
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:03,703
Doctor? Doctor?

756
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:07,003
I need help. Doctor, please.
My head.

757
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:09,475
Doctor, it hurts.

758
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:11,604
Please, I don't remember anything.

759
01:04:11,714 --> 01:04:15,150
I need help.
Please, please, I need help.

760
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:19,517
Please, please, help me.
Please, please, please.

761
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:25,588
Angelo's gonna turn state's evidence
and testify against Kenneth

762
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:30,530
in order to avoid the death penalty
unless Kenneth cooperates and testifies.

763
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:34,069
One of them is gonna get a break.
Is it going to be your client?

764
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:36,900
No, Jillian, my client
doesn't need a break.

765
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:38,735
Samantha, are you okay?

766
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:42,333
I've been calling you all morning.
They're one in the same. Kenneth is Steve.

767
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:44,572
He's the classic multiple personality.

768
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:47,808
It's a textbook case. I think he's unaWare
of the crimes committed by Steve.

769
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:49,612
Get out of my office right noW.

770
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:51,744
I'll talk to my client,
tell him What you advise,

771
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:54,186
and I'll think about What
your psychologist just said.

772
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:57,088
- Goddamn it, Sam.
- The guy needs help, not the gas chamber.

773
01:04:57,193 --> 01:04:59,661
- Did the medical examiner look at his Wounds?
- Yes.

774
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:02,026
They Were self-inflicted,
Werert they?

775
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:03,723
Werert they?

776
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:07,132
I'm gonna offer a plea agreement.
Otherwise, I think he's gonna Walk.

777
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:09,500
- On What grounds?
- He's not sane.

778
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:11,664
- What? What?
- The guy needs help.

779
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:15,972
You're the one that needs some
psychiatric counseling! Goddamn it!

780
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:18,410
There's not a goddamn DA
in their right mind in this country

781
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:20,914
Who Would drop a murder trial
With that kind of evidence in their face.

782
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:23,042
Do you knoW he murdered Women?

783
01:05:23,152 --> 01:05:25,916
- Think you can see things other people can't?
- Yes, I do.

784
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:29,389
Well, can you see this?
Fuck you!

785
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:30,891
Dick.

786
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,930
- Sam, let's go.
- Just give me a minute.

787
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:47,441
For What?
The damage is already done.

788
01:05:48,978 --> 01:05:50,912
You think I'm Wrong, don't you?

789
01:05:51,013 --> 01:05:53,641
Remember the litmus test?

790
01:05:53,749 --> 01:05:56,240
You said Kenneth passed.

791
01:07:00,816 --> 01:07:03,182
Get your stuff.
Get all your stuff.

792
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:06,277
It's not gonna happen again, Sam.

793
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:08,323
I knoW.

794
01:07:50,966 --> 01:07:52,991
So you Wanna hypnotize
my client again?

795
01:07:53,102 --> 01:07:55,696
Yes, I believe both Kenneth
and Steve inabit the same body,

796
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:58,535
but are different personalities
and different people altogether.

797
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:00,939
- And I can prove this.
- HoW do you go about proving this?

798
01:08:01,043 --> 01:08:03,603
- I need to see both of them again.
- Through hypnosis?

799
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:05,077
Yes.

800
01:08:05,181 --> 01:08:09,379
- Whatever.
- I need to speak to my client first.

801
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:18,559
- We're ready.
- You sure about this, Sam?

802
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:22,728
- Yeah, I'm ready.
- Okay.

803
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:34,066
This is Dr. Samantha Stone.

804
01:08:34,176 --> 01:08:37,441
Present With me
is Kenneth Alessio Bianchi.

805
01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:40,674
Observing are Assistant
District Attorney Jillian Dunne,

806
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,774
Detective Bryant,
Detective Smith

807
01:08:42,885 --> 01:08:47,345
and Jacob Kantor,
counsel for Mr. Bianchi.

808
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:51,017
This is a voluntary hypnosis
of Kenneth Bianchi

809
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:54,585
in order to determine
multiple personality disorder...

810
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:57,427
to meet the personality of Steve

811
01:08:57,533 --> 01:09:00,900
and any other personalities
that may be manifested.

812
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:04,097
I don't understand.

813
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:08,074
Other personalities?

814
01:09:08,177 --> 01:09:11,669
Schizophrenics generally suffer
from multiple personalities.

815
01:09:13,215 --> 01:09:15,649
They never just have one
alter ego.

816
01:09:17,286 --> 01:09:20,278
Kenneth, I Want you to relax.

817
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:25,090
You ready to begin?

818
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:32,960
Close your eyes.

819
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:37,170
I Want you to think about
your most relaxed

820
01:09:37,273 --> 01:09:39,298
and peaceful place.

821
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:43,134
Breathe in deeply.

822
01:09:44,947 --> 01:09:46,437
Exhale.

823
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:49,344
Breathe in.

824
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,677
Exhale.

825
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:57,149
Breathe in deeply.

826
01:09:58,661 --> 01:10:00,322
And exhale.

827
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,695
Breathe in.

828
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:06,930
Exhale.

829
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:13,774
I Want you to free your mind.
Forget everything...

830
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:16,811
every sight, every sound.

831
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:20,606
Just you and me.

832
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:24,016
Just the sound of my voice.

833
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:26,912
Just you...

834
01:10:27,957 --> 01:10:29,788
and me.

835
01:10:30,993 --> 01:10:34,121
I'm gonna count backwards
from five.

836
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,960
When I get to one,

837
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:39,899
you'll be in a completely
different state.

838
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:44,038
We'll be able to speak freely.

839
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:47,406
Five,

840
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:49,443
four,

841
01:10:49,545 --> 01:10:51,479
three,

842
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:53,480
tWo,

843
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:55,072
one.

844
01:10:56,051 --> 01:10:58,645
Open your eyes, Steve.

845
01:11:05,894 --> 01:11:08,260

I just need to move
this chair right here.

849
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:41,990
What the fuck Was that all about?

850
01:11:43,732 --> 01:11:46,292
Nothing. I'm sorry.

851
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:48,165
You're damn right you are.

852
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:50,500

01:13:00,609 --> 01:13:02,668
What about them?

857
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:07,308
You choked them,

858
01:13:08,984 --> 01:13:11,748
Oh, I did more than that.

859
01:13:11,854 --> 01:13:13,981
I fucked them, killed them.

860
01:13:14,089 --> 01:13:16,353
Shot one of them up
With cleaning fluid.

861
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:18,790
Why, I fucked one so hard...

862
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:22,293

863
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:25,299
she needed a tampon
just to stop the bleeding.

864
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:32,169
HoW do you like that, honey?

865
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:34,469

866
01:13:40,983 --> 01:13:43,611

867
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:49,756

The girl With the locket. Silver necklace.

868
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:54,420
Ah! The hooker.
Angelo picked her up.

869
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:56,964
I Waited in the street.

870
01:13:57,065 --> 01:13:59,465
He drove around to Where I Was.

01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:02,128
I fucked her, killed her.

872
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:04,296
We dumped the body off.

873
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:07,640
And that Was it.

874
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:10,439
Nothir to it.

875
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:20,688

You and Angelo Buono

878
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:31,424
Angelo's damn near
too fucking stupid to do shit.

879
01:14:34,403 --> 01:14:37,372
But yeah, he got a piece.

880
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:43,071
Steve Was the brains
behind the operation.

881
01:14:43,178 --> 01:14:44,645
That's right.

882
01:14:44,746 --> 01:14:47,613

884
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:54,581

She Wanted these hands

889
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:10,929
Begged for it.

890
01:15:12,774 --> 01:15:16,642

920
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:31,744

Yes.

927
01:17:52,367 --> 01:17:55,962
Kenneth, look me in the eye.

928
01:17:57,606 --> 01:18:00,097
No, Kenneth.

929
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:04,575
Kenneth, look me in the eye.

930
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:12,046
- You failed.
- Failed? Failed What?

931
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:14,213
Doctor?

932
01:18:15,724 --> 01:18:18,591
You're a liar,
and I knoW you killed those girls.

933
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:21,458
I don't remember anything, Doctor.
No, Doctor.

934
01:18:21,563 --> 01:18:24,862
Doctor, you can't leave me noW.
Doctor, no!

935
01:18:24,966 --> 01:18:28,993
Doctor! Let go of me!
No, don't leave me!

936
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:32,005
Failed? What the fuck are you talking about?
HoW did he fail?

937
01:18:32,107 --> 01:18:35,543
<i>He failed because he's a fraud</i>.
<i>He failed because he's a liar</i>.

938
01:18:35,644 --> 01:18:39,637
<i>This is outrageous. You said you were</i>
<i>gonna prove it was Steve who did this</i>.

939
01:18:39,748 --> 01:18:42,239
<i>There never was a Steve</i>.

940
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:46,514
<i>True multiple personalities are separate</i>
<i>and distinct. They do not merge</i>.

941
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:48,816
<i>It was just an act</i>
<i>the whole time</i>.

942
01:18:48,924 --> 01:18:51,085
<i>Then why doesn't Kenneth</i>
<i>remember anything?</i>

943
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:54,060
<i>He's lying about everything</i>.
<i>He was playing me from day one</i>.

944
01:18:54,162 --> 01:18:56,756
<i>How do you know that?</i>
<i>How do you know it was an act at all?</i>

945
01:18:56,865 --> 01:19:01,802
<i>Well, he invented a third personality,</i>
<i>Billy, as soon as I suggested it to him</i>.

946
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:05,703
<i>Any time he thought he needed</i>
<i>to show me something, he would</i>.

947
01:19:05,807 --> 01:19:09,868
<i>He was under hypnosis. How can he be</i>
<i>playing us if he's under hypnosis?</i>

948
01:19:09,978 --> 01:19:12,412
<i>He was never hypnotized,</i>
<i>and I proved this</i>.

949
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:16,245
<i>Under actual hypnosis, if someone</i>
<i>is given a physical obstacle, like a chair,</i>

950
01:19:16,351 --> 01:19:19,047
<i>and they are truly hypnotized,</i>
<i>they will recognize it</i>.

951
01:19:19,154 --> 01:19:23,090
<i>If not, they will do what Kenneth did</i>
<i>and walk right through it</i>.

952
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:25,159
<i>- This doesn't prove anything</i>.
<i>- It proves he's a fake</i>

953
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:27,558
<i>and proves he never</i>
<i>let me hypnotize him</i>.

954
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:30,597
- This is entrapment. You set him up.
- You agreed to it.

955
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:32,667
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah, I'm buying.

956
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:34,633
Thanks, Doc.
