1
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,813
Lake County Sheriff Department!

2
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:05,417
Holy shit.

3
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:24,728
Are you okay?

4
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,109
Shit!

5
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,099
Liberty time, you ready?

6
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,352
Give me twenty minutes.

7
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,145
You say goodnight
to some friends.

8
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,963
Geez, man!

9
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:33,880
Sorry.

10
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,882
Let him make a mistake.

11
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,592
He's not making a
mistake on his own.

12
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,620
Maybe we should
call for backup?

13
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,706
I'm pretty busy right now,
but you go right ahead.

14
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:11,460
This is, uh, Sheriff Deputy
Galloway with a high speed

15
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:12,335
pursuit on a white...

16
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:17,466
Ford Econoline van
on pine road.

17
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:57,631
Freeze!

18
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,757
Down on your knees!

19
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,553
Down on your knees!

20
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,604
You're under arrest!

21
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,107
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:35,585
Where's her morn?

23
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,213
Died a year and a half ago.

24
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:40,966
So who's coming
to get her?

25
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,262
Grandma, aunt, neighbor?

26
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,681
Child care services
will get here

27
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:48,598
when they get here.

28
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,925
I'm sorry, sweetie.

29
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,427
In order to get the
deep end bracelet,

30
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,012
you got to make it
to the other end.

31
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,103
Hey, where are you going?

32
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,647
Home. Swimming is stupid.

33
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,648
Hmm...

34
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,568
That's not what you
said on the way over here.

35
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,778
I changed my mind.

36
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,072
Hmm, you swam across
the shallow end without

37
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,532
touching the
bottom, right?

38
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,622
Hey! Hey! Hey! Guys, dmon...

39
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,832
Oh, I see!

40
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:59,586
Those guys can pass the deep
end test, but you can't?

41
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,004
MQfn!

42
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,298
I think you should
get back in the water.

43
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,799
I don't want to.

44
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:09,012
Carly, there's two types of
girls in this world:

45
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:13,183
girls who say I can't, and
girls who say watch this.

46
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,351
Which one are you?

47
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:14,911
This is DCFS. We would like
to set up a time for--

48
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:20,250
Do you have any idea how
stupid the state of Nevada is?

49
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,127
I have a feeling you're
about to tell me.

50
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,634
Clint Gray is a problem?

51
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,887
Child services is trying
to arrange a supervised

52
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,764
visit with him and Carly.

53
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:35,640
Hernandez.

54
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,017
This is how it starts, Lewis!

55
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,852
Look, hang on a second.
-No, no! It's not happening.

56
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,104
You need to get Judge
Grimes on the line now.

57
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,189
That's not how it works.

58
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,988
2005, assault and battery.

59
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,199
2009, assault and battery
of a police officer.

60
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:58,580
2005 to 2010? Trafficking of
illegal animals through his

61
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:03,043
house which include
Burmese pythons, wolves,

62
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,003
a god damn tiger.

63
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,173
You ever heard of a
sports team named the

64
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,009
Brooklyn Bunnies or the
Pennsylvania Puppy Dogs?

65
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,929
A lot of people like wild,
vicious animals, Meredith.

66
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,806
He just sold people what
they wanted to buy.

67
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,058
It's no different
than dealing.

68
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,227
He had them in the
house with Carly.

69
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,980
And he served his time,
and now he's out,

70
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,607
and he's still her dad.

71
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,692
I'm not letting
him near her.

72
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,527
That's not up to you.

73
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:34,449
Look, it could be six
weeks, it could be six

74
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,909
months, but it's
gonna happen.

75
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,661
You should be more
concerned with enforcing

76
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,872
the law rather than
ignoring the parts

77
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,207
that you don't like.

78
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,709
It's my job to
keep her safe.

79
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:51,216
Just make the call, please.

80
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:58,431
Alright, I don't think
it will help, but

81
00:09:58,515 --> 00:09:59,849
I'll see what I can do.

82
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:01,893
Thank you.

83
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,866
Christopher, did you see
the bears are active sign?

84
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:40,742
Yep.

85
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,119
Do you think that
the bears are active?

86
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,037
Nope.

87
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,582
Do we have to do this
without people around?

88
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,876
What about the bears?

89
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,502
Come on!

90
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:05,433
Christopher, I
forgot my iPad.

91
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,185
I need to take some
pictures of the lake

92
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,479
and send them
to Lois Etsler.

93
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,273
She said she heard
it's not that nice.

94
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,108
Yeah, well she's an idiot.

95
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,487
I think she's just jealous
because Bernie took her

96
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,364
to the Lobster Lounge
for their fortieth.

97
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:23,660
She's just gonna die when she
sees how clear it is.

98
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,162
I Wish.

99
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:27,914
What did you say?

100
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,751
I said I'll be right here
when you get back, darling.

101
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:32,794
Okay.

102
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,156
Christopher?

103
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,709
Holy moley!

104
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,222
Huh!

105
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,709
Christopher!

106
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,796
No!!!

107
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,933
No. no!!

108
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,706
So, a forty niner tries
to escape into the lake,

109
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,875
but the bear was faster?

110
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,835
It catches him a few
feet into the water

111
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,213
and proceeds to rip
the poor guy apart.

112
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,548
And the wife
saw all this?

113
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,635
M'mm. She was coming
down from the car.

114
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,304
She's not exactly
Usain Bolt.

115
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,807
She heard the attack, but she
fell down and hit her head.

116
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,684
By the time she got here,
yogi was already done

117
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:54,727
with lunch.

118
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:56,604
What kind of bear?

119
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,773
A big one.

120
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,983
You sure it's a bear?

121
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:01,984
Wasn't a deer.

122
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,486
Are there tracks?

123
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,320
In the water?

124
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,488
On the beach.

125
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,242
I don't know. I'm
not Jane Goodall.

126
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,786
She's gorillas, not bears.

127
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,454
Will you stop?

128
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,415
I just don't get it.

129
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,834
Here we go.

130
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,628
So a bear went into the
lake and killed somebody?

131
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:24,215
They eat fish, our bear
went in to get dinner,

132
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,175
and this poor asshole
got in his way.

133
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,512
Look, don't over
complicate this.

134
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,640
Park rangers are on their
way, we're sending some

135
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,559
of their younger guys to
help outwith the hunt,

136
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,520
they'll kill this thing,
and then we'll go back to

137
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,480
breaking up house parties.

138
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,442
We still have to
rule out homicide.

139
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,485
You're kidding me, right?

140
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,696
No person is
capable of this.

141
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,740
You sure about that?

142
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,799
Perfect. I'm starving.

143
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,387
At least you could tell
us what's on the menu.

144
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,475
Larson...

145
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,894
You got thirty seconds
to get out of my house.

146
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,354
Don needs to see you.

147
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,690
Time to get back
to work, buddy.

148
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,275
I don't work
for him anymore.

149
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,569
Well, he doesn't agree
and not all opinions are

150
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:09,695
created equal.

151
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,619
Look, here's what we
are going to do...

152
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,288
You are going to go for
a little ride, see Don,

153
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,582
and you two can figure
out the details.

154
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,796
Your thirty seconds are up.

155
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,926
Make this easy. We don't
like to hurt old timers.

156
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,443
You're not gonna shoot me...

157
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,620
But we both know that
I will shoot you.

158
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,754
Come on, get up.

159
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,848
Come on, big boy,
let's get out of here.

160
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,262
Whose turn is it?

161
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,640
Mine. I got a good one.

162
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,808
Okay, is it a girl?

163
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,935
No.

164
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,313
Okay, is it Locklyn?

165
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,272
No.

166
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:09,774
Is he in second grade?
-Nope.

167
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,776
Is he in third grade?

168
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:12,777
Nope.

169
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,279
You don't know any fourth
grade boys, do you?

170
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,406
Mom, no!

171
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,951
Hmm, is it grandma's
friend Mr. Mean?

172
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:24,163
Ew, no! Mom, it's
an easy one.

173
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,544
Is it your dad?

174
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:34,215
What? No.

175
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,925
It's Lewis G.

176
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,677
Oh, right.

177
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:42,473
I told you, an easy one.

178
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,354
Just the two of you?

179
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,146
Yes.

180
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,481
Follow me.

181
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:54,568
Thank you.

182
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,863
Are they the ones
looking for the bear?

183
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,616
No, who told you that?

184
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,245
Patrick, he said it was
twenty-two feet tall.

185
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,329
Well, it's not.

186
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:06,622
Do you know what
you wanna eat?

187
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,791
Do you think it's
still eating that guy?

188
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,460
How much of him do
you think is left?

189
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,503
Carly...

190
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,339
There was a bear
attack today?

191
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:16,340
Yup.

192
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:17,550
Unconfirmed.

193
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,261
Patrick said some bears
only like the taste of

194
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,972
humans and that he is
stalking is next victim

195
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,306
right now.

196
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,018
Well, Patrick is
being highly creative.

197
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:30,020
Patrick also said that
a police man would

198
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:32,064
kill the bear and I
said it would be you.

199
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,734
But he said it had
to be a policeman.

200
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,987
Well, Patrick is sexist,
now go wash your hands.

201
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,447
Mom, he's nine.

202
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,073
He's still sexist.

203
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,373
You re a cop?

204
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,125
Another PhD at a bar?

205
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:54,920
Can I ask you about
the bear attack?

206
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,255
I can't talk about it.

207
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,007
Oh, of course, yeah.

208
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,509
It's just that statistically
a bear attack is very

209
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:03,095
unlikely, contrary to
what Patrick might think.

210
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,805
I mean there have only
been twenty-seven bear

211
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:07,683
fatalities in north
America since 2000.

212
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,852
Meanwhile, thirty-two
people were killed by dogs

213
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:10,770
last year alone.

214
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,438
How do you know all this?

215
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,689
I actually do have a PhD.

216
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,357
In bears?

217
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,318
No.

218
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,820
I teach oceanography at the
University of Rhode Island.

219
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:22,823
So what are you doing
in a bar at Alpine Lake?

220
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,575
I'm here for
the trout sex.

221
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,536
I'm here writing a paper.

222
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,580
It's not as exciting
as it sounds.

223
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,165
It doesn't sound
exciting at all.

224
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,836
As for the super
impressive bear stats,

225
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,546
it's not the PhD.

226
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,549
It's the Internet, and
according to this,

227
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,511
a bear attack is
not impossible,

228
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:44,553
I just wouldn't
bet on it.

229
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:48,432
So I should interrogate all the
neighborhood dogs instead?

230
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:49,809
Stats would support that.

231
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,103
Hey, good luck.

232
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,612
Oh, you little hooligan.

233
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:06,242
Shh! Carly's asleep.

234
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,495
This dog is gonna
be the death of me!

235
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:22,216
Oh.

236
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,468
Should we be worried
about this bear?

237
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,430
It's not a bear.

238
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,642
Has Carly mentioned
anything to you about

239
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,477
her dad recently?

240
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:36,605
I'd tell you if she did.
-So she hasn't?

241
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,026
You know he's--

242
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:46,991
I know. He's going to
see her sooner or later.

243
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,285
Later.

244
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:39,960
I have a great idea.

245
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:43,672
Let's make a
fire and then...

246
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:53,933
Ugh!

247
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:55,434
Are you okay?

248
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,936
Should we go back?

249
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:03,108
I'm so sorry that I
distracted you.

250
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:06,612
Let me see how I
can make it up.

251
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,368
Warmer in the water.

252
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,226
What was that?

253
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,435
What was what?

254
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,020
I just felt something.
I don't know.

255
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:40,854
I did, too.

256
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,523
No, I'm serious.

257
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:48,112
Dude, Anthony, if you're
messing with me right now,

258
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,571
I'm gonna kick your ass.

259
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:50,823
Hey, its okay.

260
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,950
If you're not ready
then we can just wait.

261
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:53,575
Aghhh!

262
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:54,576
Ahhhh!

263
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,890
If I'm the one
that gets the bear,

264
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,476
Lindsay's totally
gonna take me back.

265
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,812
Especially when she reads
about me in the newspaper.

266
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:27,813
Lindsay can't read.

267
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,648
Oh, I'll be on
the news, too.

268
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,526
Think they'll let me
mount the bear head

269
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,527
on the wall?

270
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,737
Dude, these are
tranquilizer guns.

271
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,406
All I'm saying is--

272
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,473
I talked to the dogs.
it was a bear after all.

273
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:04,850
You were wrong.

274
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:09,062
No, I'm not.

275
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,565
Your killer's
definitely not a bear.

276
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:00,155
This has been a terrible
tragedy for the victims,

277
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,657
and our thoughts and
prayers are with

278
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,574
their families.

279
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,368
Jesus, he's not picking up.

280
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:07,329
Pick up your phone, Lewis!

281
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:17,506
I do want to commend the
Department of Conservation

282
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,467
and Natural Resources for
their quick apprehension

283
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,885
of a black bear.

284
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:26,890
It is a male approximately
five hundred pounds

285
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:29,393
and now the people
of Nevada don't have

286
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,436
to worry anymore
about being harmed.

287
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,562
How big was the bear?

288
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:33,563
Uhh, five hundred pounds--

289
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:36,149
everybody, get out
of the water!

290
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,485
We got him! It's
under control!

291
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:41,571
No, it's not!
Get 'em out now!

292
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:42,698
Hernandez!

293
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:43,824
Get em out!

294
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,039
Oh shit!

295
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,929
Tell him what you told me.

296
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,890
Okay well, see...

297
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:11,393
Most sharks, if you
drop them in a lake,

298
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,186
they'll absorb too much
fresh water relative to

299
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,439
their body solvents
basically causing them

300
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:16,940
to drown from
the inside out.

301
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:20,861
But bull sharks, bull
sharks are very special.

302
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,612
They're unique in that
they have the ability to

303
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,740
regulate their kidneys
to suit the salinity

304
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:25,741
of the water
they're in.

305
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,826
This type of variable
osmoregulaiton is only

306
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,953
seen in a small
percentage of sharks.

307
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,455
It's not possible.

308
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,749
Who's ever heard of
a shark in a lake?

309
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,417
Bulls have been known
to swim way up the

310
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,877
Mississippi River.

311
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,212
They've been spotted
in Lake Michigan.

312
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:40,213
A whole bunch of
them swimming happily

313
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:41,715
in Lake Nicaragua.

314
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:45,218
Well, how long can it
last in that without having

315
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:48,722
saltfus... ozmo...
whatchamacallit kills it?

316
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:52,142
Bullsharks won't expire due
to the lack of salinity.

317
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,602
In English?

318
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:58,148
It will live and thrive
until somebody removes it

319
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,024
or kills it.

320
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:01,651
We don't have a river that
connects to the Pacific

321
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:05,947
so professor, how did
it get into my lake?

322
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,908
That's a good question.

323
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,577
If I had to guess, I'd say--
-Somebody put it there.

324
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:14,998
Are you ready for
your big swim meet?

325
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:17,959
Don't be nervous!

326
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,170
You need to go right now.

327
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,094
I'm sorry.

328
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:31,348
Just um...

329
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,517
Just tell her that uh...

330
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,436
Just tell her I stopped
by to talk to her, alright?

331
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,771
I'll tell her.

332
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,256
Sheriff, can you
confirm its a shark?

333
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,966
As I'm sure you
all know by now,

334
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,884
there was another accident...

335
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:09,678
on the lake this morning.

336
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,404
We don't have a ton
to go by just yet,

337
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:30,740
but we are taking
every precaution here.

338
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:33,994
We are temporarily
closing the beaches,

339
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,496
and urn, we are asking
everyone to stay out

340
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,207
of the water until we can
confirm that it's safe.

341
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,004
The headline here is
that we're on it!

342
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,716
And soon everything
will be back to normal.

343
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,758
Trust me.

344
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,642
I love you, and I'll
always protect you.

345
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:58,935
You know that right?

346
00:32:59,019 --> 00:32:59,895
Mmm-hmm.

347
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:05,150
It's not that he's, he's...

348
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,194
Look, I have to say this,
and I'm not trying to

349
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:10,030
scare you, but if he
comes up to you somewhere,

350
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,240
and he's not going to,
but if he does,

351
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:14,951
you just have to
go find an adult.

352
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:19,164
Grandma, me, or your
teacher. Right away.

353
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,582
Does that make sense?

354
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:25,921
But he's not bad, right?

355
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,172
My dad?

356
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:33,386
He's made some mistakes.

357
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,013
But no, honey, he's not bad.

358
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,405
Morning, clint.

359
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,830
Don, could you not
eat on my couch.

360
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,290
I'll send my maid over.

361
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:16,972
You know, lately my wife has
been on this vegan kick.

362
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,848
I gotta get my
meat where I can.

363
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,393
So, how you been, clint?

364
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,647
Fine.

365
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,148
Well, good for you.

366
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:31,444
I wish I could say the
same about myself.

367
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:34,155
I've been stressed

368
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,998
Have you been
following the news?

369
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:49,629
Not particularly.

370
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:53,049
Well, apparently there's
something in the lake.

371
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:56,428
And guess what?
It's mine.

372
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,183
I'm not interested.

373
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:06,146
Well, it's not a matter of
your interet level, Clint.

374
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:11,318
We had a deal and your about
five years late on your rent.

375
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,782
No, Don,
I paid for it.

376
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:20,660
And I feel for you,

377
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:24,706
but when I buy something,
I expect to get it.

378
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:29,419
And if I start letting things
slide and calling it even,

379
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:33,048
this puts me in a very
precarious position.

380
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:36,426
So I tell you
what I'm gonna do...

381
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:39,846
I am gonna come
back here tomorrow

382
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:44,309
and you are gonna give
me one of two things...

383
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,520
My money or my shark.

384
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:53,818
Clint, you're my only friend
who's really good at finding

385
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:55,236
these animals.

386
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,822
I mean, most of my other
friends, they're just good at

387
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,949
finding uh, people.

388
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:08,750
She's cute.

389
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:12,587
You touch her and I
kill everyone you know.

390
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,883
She's very sweet.

391
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,721
Go fish and I give
this back to you.

392
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,687
I'll even let you use my boat.

393
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:37,862
You have a day.

394
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:45,829
Oh, just remember to
wash it when you're done.

395
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:05,306
A shark?

396
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,183
I need that restraining
order, today.

397
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:08,560
Not now Hernandez.

398
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,353
I also don't believe a
shark will respond

399
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:14,107
to a restraining order,
but don't worry lovely,

400
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,567
he'll respond to me.

401
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,528
Garreth Ross.

402
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:19,446
Good for you.

403
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:22,407
Host of fish
fried on the BBC.

404
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,451
Never heard of it.

405
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,203
I catch these monsters
for a living, hun,

406
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:28,955
and I'll catch yours
for the great low price

407
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,498
of allowing me to film it.

408
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:33,918
We'll cut in some interviews
with concerned citizenry,

409
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,795
add a little dun-dun,
dun-dun. Dun-dun.

410
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:39,674
Catch the bastard and be out of
your knickers by nightfall.

411
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:42,427
Unless, of course,
you have other ideas.

412
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:46,931
I'll leave you to it.

413
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,441
Tell that guy to take his
camera and shove it up his

414
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,692
arrogant ass.

415
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,068
People died here.

416
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:01,154
We're not making a reality
TV show out of this.

417
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,573
Look, he's done it before.

418
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:04,449
Lewis!

419
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,493
You know, for some reason
everybody else around here

420
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,244
calls me Sheriff.

421
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:09,746
What's your point?

422
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,164
You wanna know the reason
why we're letting this guy

423
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,040
catch the shark?

424
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,167
Because he knows how
to catch the shark.

425
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,376
He's done it before.

426
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,462
That ass clown
doesn't care.

427
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,130
Stop! You're down
lifegaurding now.

428
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:20,965
Okay? It's out
of your hands.

429
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:27,138
What about Clint Gray?

430
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,182
Seriously? We're
bringing that up now?

431
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,475
It can't wait.

432
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,811
Have you noticed we're in the
middle of a shit storm?

433
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:33,770
He came over to my house.

434
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:34,938
I don't care.
-Lewis!

435
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,189
We're done.

436
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,901
This big. Extraordinary!

437
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,487
Celebratory cocktails
this evening, officer?

438
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:47,283
I'll take that
as a maybe.

439
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:09,277
Wait, I shouldn't
smile, should I?

440
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,195
Or should I?

441
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:13,698
Just be emotionally
honest, darling.

442
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:17,368
How do the events of the past
twenty-four hours make you feel?

443
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:21,164
Well, scared I guess.
I mean I'm just here for

444
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,915
a bachelorette party,
I wasn't even planning

445
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:23,916
going swimming.

446
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,086
I lay out. Lakes gross
me out, you know?

447
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,756
Oh, absolutely disgusting
things, lakes.

448
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,716
Totally.

449
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,469
I love your accent by the way.

450
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,387
It's my money maker.

451
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:41,184
Tell you what? Why don't
you tell the camera

452
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:44,395
that you don't feel safe in
your own backyard anymore,

453
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:48,566
that your terribly frightened,
but confident at the same

454
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:53,613
time, that you feel safe
again now that I'm here.

455
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,406
In your own words, of course.

456
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:58,701
Then you can give me
your phone number and

457
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:00,953
I'll meet up with you and
your bachelorette party

458
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:02,497
as soon as I'm done fishing.

459
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,125
Roll it.

460
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:12,298
I'm like super scared of
the shark, but so, so happy

461
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:14,258
that you're here
to save everyone.

462
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:18,513
I feel like I can
finally breathe again.

463
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,973
I'm not going to lie to you...

464
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:26,104
We're dealing with a monster
here, nature's serial killer.

465
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:28,397
I can only promise
to do my best.

466
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:33,319
I'm Garreth Ross.

467
00:43:37,073 --> 00:43:39,700
Listen, I don't pretend to
know how television works

468
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:41,536
and while it's really
interesting watching you

469
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,704
stare at yourself like my
fifteen-year-old daughter

470
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:45,832
in the mirror, we need
to catch this shark

471
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:47,458
and we need to do it now.

472
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:52,755
By all means.
Shall we?

473
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:13,776
First rule of shark fishing
is a good chum slick.

474
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:25,872
Shark smells that, he
thinks it's dinner time.

475
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,374
He would be wrong.

476
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:32,295
And cut. Good?

477
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:35,923
Wont be long now.

478
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:47,643
Soviet APS underwater
assault rifle.

479
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,066
What the hell are you
doing with this thing?

480
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,494
How long can a shark
survive in that lake

481
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:07,538
without anybody
knowing about it?

482
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:09,373
Morning, officer.

483
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:12,460
You're sleeping in
the middle of the day?

484
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,837
Yeah, I was up all night
researching bull sharks.

485
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:16,339
So, how long?

486
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:19,175
I don't... I don't know.

487
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:23,679
There's plenty of food, no
predators, and it's a big lake.

488
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:26,015
Five years?

489
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:29,644
I don't... I don't know.
It's possible I guess.

490
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:31,812
This is a bull
shark, right?

491
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:33,231
Hang on.

492
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:42,114
I think five years ago, Clint
Gray put this shark in the lake

493
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:43,950
and now I think he's
trying to kill it.

494
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,373
What's wrong?

495
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,759
You're gonna kill
it with that?

496
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:04,345
No, I'm gonna
dance with it first.

497
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:06,847
You have to give the
people what they want.

498
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,643
Then I'm going to get back
in the boat and catch it

499
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,144
like the proper
fisherman I am.

500
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:19,568
There!

501
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:25,449
Looks to be about
an eight footer.

502
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,451
Relatively docile.

503
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,121
Roll it. Shoot to
hide the spear.

504
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,001
Our shark is in the water,

505
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:39,171
circling the boat very
quickly, erratically,

506
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:40,298
from what I can tell,

507
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:42,967
were dealing with a very
aggressive animal here.

508
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,760
Atleast a thirteen footer.

509
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:49,765
I'm about to come face to
face with a ruthless killer.

510
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:51,309
Wish me luck.

511
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:55,563
Cut it. Gear up.

512
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:04,697
Come on man, chop chop!

513
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,524
It's a coordinated attack.

514
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,776
Not possible.
Bull sharks hunt alone.

515
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,320
Watch.
-Turn it off.

516
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:10,823
I mean, occasionally
in pairs, but that's rare.

517
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:12,074
I'm serious, Hernandez.

518
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:13,784
The first one is acting
as bait, but then

519
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:15,786
before you know it, the
bait becomes a predator

520
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:16,704
and then it's over.

521
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,165
Turn that god
damn thing off!

522
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:26,922
It really doesn't
matter how they hunt.

523
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:29,508
Tomorrow, we're hunting them.

524
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:33,220
Every fisherman in the
state who wants to get

525
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:36,390
paid is going after them. I
got approval from the mayor.

526
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:37,850
10k per dead fish.

527
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,769
Peter?

528
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:46,692
All do respect, sir,
that's not such a good idea.

529
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:49,028
If you don't have the right
gear and more importantly,

530
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:52,615
the right kinda boat, it'll
be Thanksgiving out there

531
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,116
for the sharks I mean.

532
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,785
Oh, I understand the problem.
We got a big boy out there

533
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:59,205
and two of his friends, but
there's gonna be a whole lot

534
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:00,706
more of us.

535
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:04,251
It's actually a big girl,
and by the looks of it,

536
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:05,711
two of her pups.

537
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:08,005
What do you mean?

538
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,882
She was pregnant when
she went into the lake.

539
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,598
Same old shit.

540
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:20,601
You need a break.

541
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:22,895
I'm fine.

542
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:27,274
Do you always look this
angry when you're fine?

543
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:28,275
Yes.

544
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:32,530
C'mon, let me buy you a
drink. It'll be good for you.

545
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:35,241
How do you know
what's good for me?

546
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:36,492
I'm a doctor.

547
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,244
Who studies fish.

548
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:41,830
Still a doctor.
One drink?

549
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:49,129
Okay, fine. One drink.
Just let me change.

550
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:00,391
First date jitters?

551
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,101
This isn't a date.

552
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:03,727
Really?

553
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:06,522
Cause I've been on a
few dates before.

554
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:09,733
I mean, not a ton, but
a respectable amount.

555
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:12,444
This is usually
what they're like.

556
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:14,071
Do you think they
enjoy killing?

557
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:18,909
I take that back, this
isn't what they're like.

558
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:20,744
I'm sorry, but do they?

559
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,957
No more than any
other predator.

560
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,334
I mean, they like eating,
they don't like starving.

561
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:29,253
So you don't think
they're evil?

562
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,465
No, no, I just think they're
really good at their job.

563
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:37,845
Their eyes. The one
that killed Garreth?

564
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:38,929
They were evil.

565
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:42,224
You can make them villains, but
they're just doing what millions

566
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:45,227
of years of evolution has
programmed them to do.

567
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:46,562
They're surviving.

568
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:49,732
I can't stop thinking about
those people that died.

569
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:53,527
All they did was go into a lake
that was supposed to be safe.

570
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:54,820
Well, who said
it was safe?

571
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:55,988
You know what I mean.

572
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:59,158
Earth is a bad
neighborhood, Meredith.

573
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:01,368
Isn't that a little dramatic?

574
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:04,371
No, I mean, in fact, people
underestimate all the time

575
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:06,999
what a bad neighborhood
it is, alright?

576
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,668
Humans build buildings,
and bridges, and roads,

577
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:11,295
and resorts on lakes.

578
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,964
Okay, we have police departments
and all sorts of other

579
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:16,342
things to help us
pretend that we're safe.

580
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:18,177
We put all these
layers on top of nature

581
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,013
and then we pretend
that it's not nature.

582
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:23,057
I mean, maybe it's too
scary to think about

583
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,892
what it's really
like out there.

584
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:27,144
It doesn't have
to be like that.

585
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,479
Yeah, it does.

586
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:32,066
Because all living things
on Earth are doing

587
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,276
the same three things.

588
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,695
One, they're finding food.

589
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:38,489
Which is exactly what
that shark was doing

590
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,032
when he went after
those people.

591
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:42,284
And two, all animals
are programmed to

592
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:43,702
protect their young

593
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:45,829
which is what you do
every day of the week.

594
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:47,998
So if every animal
is willing to do

595
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:50,250
whatever it takes to
protect their young...

596
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:56,215
Some will live.

597
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:57,633
And some will die.

598
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:24,743
Don't wimp out.

599
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:31,917
Where are you?

600
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,982
Wanna walk the
mutt with me?

601
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:58,402
No, thanks, grandma. I
have way too much homework.

602
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:01,029
It's criminal how
they work you kids.

603
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:02,906
Yeah, urn, totally.

604
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:06,285
Okay, honey. I'll
be back in five.

605
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:35,063
Heel!

606
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:38,317
That means nothing
to you I suppose.

607
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:42,780
What's the third thing?

608
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:43,906
What do you mean?

609
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,324
All living things.

610
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:48,994
They find food,
protect their young,

611
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,579
What's the third
thing they do?

612
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,209
Are you flirting with me?

613
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:56,585
Not at all.

614
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:58,504
I'm just trying to figure
out what the third thing is.

615
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:01,507
Do you need my help?

616
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:07,513
Hmm, no. But I'll let you
know when I figure it out.

617
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:09,932
Can I have your
keys? I'm driving.

618
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:31,912
Hey!

619
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:36,375
Oliver! Stop!

620
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,595
Oliver!

621
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,563
Oliver!

622
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:25,382
Where are you going?

623
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:28,468
Oh, I'm walking you in.

624
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:30,888
We're not playing
meet the family.

625
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:34,016
Oh, did I mention
I have a phd?

626
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,561
I mean, that plays
well with the mothers.

627
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,813
Your daughter and
I both like bears.

628
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:42,274
And I'll make killer
pancakes for the four of us

629
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:43,233
in the morning.

630
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:45,861
I'm kidding.

631
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:49,865
Goodbye, Peter.

632
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:15,432
MQfn!

633
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:01,812
You Okay?

634
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,526
They're going to take the
shark to the morgue

635
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,361
and cut it open and
see what's inside.

636
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,989
It was almost my mother.

637
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:13,073
Yeah, but it wasn't.

638
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,032
Two seconds.

639
00:58:14,116 --> 00:58:14,992
Meredith.

640
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:17,285
I know.

641
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:22,040
I know she's completely fine,
but clearly idiotic.

642
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:26,545
I nearly lost her, Peter.

643
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:28,714
It'll all be over soon.

644
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:31,091
You can get back to
human criminals and

645
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,592
I'll go back to fish sex.

646
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,972
She's gone! She's gone!

647
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:39,599
She was here and
now she's gone!

648
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:41,018
Are we sure she's okay?

649
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:42,519
It's him.

650
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,396
Come on! Give me your keys!
-Okay.

651
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:03,540
Hello? Anybody home?

652
00:59:51,797 --> 00:59:54,508
I need an APB to go out
on Clint Gray for the

653
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,259
kidnapping of Carly Gray.

654
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:58,512
Send a unit to
14 Pine Road.

655
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:19,342
He's not here.

656
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:21,803
He's probably half
way to Canada by now.

657
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:39,738
Scratch that. We're
gonna need some backup.

658
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:09,684
Freeze!

659
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:13,980
Hey, what's the
problem officer?

660
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:17,734
You're under arrest for the
kidnapping of Carly Gray.

661
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:20,195
She's been kidnapped?

662
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,571
Now taste the deck!

663
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:24,074
You heard me. Come on!

664
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,828
Come on. Do it!

665
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:29,996
Don't hurt my dad!

666
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,799
Stay down, Carly!

667
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,359
How does the deck taste?

668
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:11,204
We're gonna need a boat.

669
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:11,955
Come on!

670
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,515
Carly!

671
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:33,768
Wow, you're beautiful.

672
01:03:33,852 --> 01:03:37,105
You got so... So big!

673
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:40,692
Thanks. My mom says I'm
eight going on eighteen.

674
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:45,030
Yeah, yeah, I can see that.

675
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:49,200
Look, I'm sorry I
haven't been around.

676
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:52,954
I miss you very much.

677
01:03:53,038 --> 01:03:55,165
I knew you were nice.

678
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:08,803
Hey, so how'd you
find me, sweetie?

679
01:04:08,887 --> 01:04:11,348
In mom's office, there
were papers about you.

680
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:13,808
What you did and stuff
and where you live.

681
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:17,896
Mom's office, huh?

682
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:20,315
Are you mad at me?

683
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:24,027
No! Not even a
little bit.

684
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,863
But right now, we
gotta get you home.

685
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:28,782
Is it cause the Sherrif
was trying to make you

686
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:30,116
go back to jail?

687
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:34,454
No, no. Forget about him.
They're all gone now.

688
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,539
Then why do I have to go home?

689
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:39,501
Here, put this on.

690
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:42,962
It's late, your mom's
all worried about you.

691
01:04:43,046 --> 01:04:45,382
Soon we'll get to
hang out all the time.

692
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:47,509
Maybe we can go to the
playground tomorrow!

693
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,386
Oh, yeah, maybe!

694
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:50,470
Do you like tacos?

695
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:52,889
Cause we could get tacos
after the playground.

696
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:54,641
Yeah, I love tacos.

697
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:57,018
Me too.

698
01:04:57,102 --> 01:04:59,312
Hey, get up
here. Alright.

699
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:01,147
We're gonna go.

700
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:05,235
Hang on.

701
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:13,701
If we're going home,
isn't it that way?

702
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:17,914
Yeah, well, we're taking
the scenic route.

703
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:21,835
So the plan is to take the
boat out, scour the lake

704
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:24,546
in the dark, and hope we
find Clint and your daughter

705
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:26,756
before he decides that
tooling around in the middle

706
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,758
of the night isn't the
best way to prove his

707
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:30,844
parental bonafides?

708
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:34,139
Hernandez! Right here.

709
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:35,932
That's your boat?

710
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:37,517
Well, yeah?

711
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,728
I don't think it's big
enough, but it'll do.

712
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:47,444
Keys?

713
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:49,070
Um, it's my boat.

714
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:50,155
I'm driving.

715
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:12,302
Y'all know there's
sharks out there, right?

716
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:14,345
Yeah, which means you need
to get out of the water.

717
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:17,265
Oh, I don't think so,
chief. See I got me a plan.

718
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:19,684
I'm gonna lure those sons
of bitches out there

719
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:21,686
with these here deer guts.
Look, my buddy Roddy shows

720
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:24,063
up with his rig, I'm gonna
lure 'em right to him.

721
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:26,232
Barn! We gonna get us a
ripe, fat paycheck.

722
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:28,818
Sir! You need to get the
hell out of the water.

723
01:06:28,902 --> 01:06:31,654
What? And leave the sharks
to you? Don't think so.

724
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:48,922
How big is the lake exactly?

725
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,465
Two hundred square miles.

726
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:53,927
So we plan on finding
him next month then?

727
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,762
This thing doesn't
have stealth mode.

728
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:57,514
The faster we go,
the louder we get.

729
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,064
Why don't we just turn back,
you know, and wait for light?

730
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:07,315
Shh! Shh!

731
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:08,691
Shh! Did you hear that?

732
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,905
Yeah, where's it coming from?

733
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,335
Peter!

734
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,433
Throw me a rope!

735
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,447
Peter!

736
01:07:56,531 --> 01:07:57,699
Hang on!

737
01:08:10,712 --> 01:08:11,796
I'm coming!

738
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:17,927
Peter, get out of the water!

739
01:08:32,317 --> 01:08:33,735
Don't look back, just swim!

740
01:09:00,762 --> 01:09:04,682
Ahhhhhh!

741
01:09:04,766 --> 01:09:06,309
It's my fault.

742
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:08,394
I shouldn't have let
him come out here.

743
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:10,021
We shouldn't be out here.

744
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:12,649
Well, let's go
back. Right now!

745
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:15,401
Before anyone
else gets hurt.

746
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:17,737
I can't do that.
Carly's out here.

747
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,489
How do you know?

748
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:22,784
We have every cop in Alpine
Lake out looking for him.

749
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:27,455
He knows that and if
he's smart, and he is...

750
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:29,749
He's gonna lay low out
here until morning

751
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:31,334
when every idiot and
his brother is out

752
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:32,752
fishing sharks.

753
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:34,712
He knows the chief is gonna
turn everyone onto them

754
01:09:34,796 --> 01:09:37,006
and he'll ditch his boat
and be gone with Carly.

755
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:41,469
But he's not gone yet.

756
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:50,103
Then we'll keep looking.

757
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,317
Okay.

758
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:05,493
Shit!

759
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:11,124
I'm sorry, Meredith.

760
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:13,167
I'll call the station. It'll
take them a couple hours,

761
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:14,001
but they'll find us.

762
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:16,838
I don't think we
have a couple hours.

763
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:22,719
Here, take this.

764
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:31,144
Come on! Pick up!

765
01:10:43,448 --> 01:10:45,283
I don't wanna play
Titanic anymore.

766
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,745
I don't remember there being
any sharks in titanic.

767
01:10:50,872 --> 01:10:51,831
Not funny.

768
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:58,004
Look, they'll be here soon.

769
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:01,591
Yeah, well, not soon enough.

770
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:04,385
What are you doing?

771
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:05,887
I'm making a weapon.

772
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:12,935
Sorry, seeing as I left
my glock at home and all.

773
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,499
Maybe they went away.

774
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:36,709
You think?

775
01:11:41,923 --> 01:11:45,885
The scientist in me says that
predators don't just vanish

776
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:50,223
from rich, uncontested
waters for no reason.

777
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:54,185
The human being who's floating
helplessly in these waters

778
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:55,978
hopes the scientist is wrong.

779
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:06,739
Well, as long as
this thing is still on,

780
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:08,491
they can track us by GPS.

781
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:11,077
Even in the lake?

782
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:13,996
Technically, yes.

783
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,458
Have you ever done that before?

784
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:18,417
No.

785
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:47,780
You Okay?

786
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:49,490
Yeah, I'm just cold.

787
01:12:49,574 --> 01:12:50,533
Oh, here.

788
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:55,371
This probably doesn't help.

789
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:56,664
It does.

790
01:12:58,457 --> 01:12:59,709
Meredith.

791
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:03,087
I'm sorry. What if I
never see her again?

792
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:05,298
She's so young.
She needs me.

793
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:08,259
Yeah, she does. And that's why
we're getting out of here.

794
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:10,428
Okay? You need to
believe it, alright?

795
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:12,722
That's what you
said, right?

796
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:15,391
We're getting out
of here. Say it.

797
01:13:15,474 --> 01:13:16,642
We're getting
out of here.

798
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:20,271
Feel better?

799
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:23,232
Not really.

800
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:27,528
Ahh, see?

801
01:13:27,612 --> 01:13:29,989
It's not so bad, right?

802
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:33,117
I've been on dates
worse than this.

803
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,243
I doubt it.

804
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:40,541
This girl in college,

805
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:44,295
she wanted to have some
fun with handcuffs.

806
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:48,341
We tried the key and found out
that it went to her bike lock.

807
01:13:50,885 --> 01:13:53,429
I was chained... I was
chained to a pink futon

808
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:58,267
for nine hours while she
studied for an art history

809
01:13:58,351 --> 01:14:00,144
final three feet away.

810
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:02,521
Peter.

811
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:04,523
Just last month, she was--

812
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:05,733
Peter, stop!

813
01:14:08,569 --> 01:14:09,570
Oh, shit!

814
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:33,427
How long before they--

815
01:14:33,511 --> 01:14:35,054
Whoa! Whoa!

816
01:14:57,702 --> 01:14:58,494
Peter!

817
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:20,141
Peter!

818
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:28,858
Oh my god!

819
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:34,780
Peter?

820
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:38,701
Peter?

821
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:48,794
Oh my god!

822
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:56,218
Peter!

823
01:15:58,637 --> 01:16:00,723
No! Peter!

824
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:07,313
Peter!

825
01:16:42,223 --> 01:16:43,641
Where's Carly?

826
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:45,184
You're not gonna shoot
me again, are you?

827
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:47,978
If there's one
scratch on her...

828
01:16:48,062 --> 01:16:49,146
I will.

829
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:50,981
She's sleeping. Go
see for yourself.

830
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:00,783
Mom?

831
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:01,700
Carly!

832
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:04,286
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

833
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:07,414
Oh, no, baby! You don't
have to apologize.

834
01:17:07,498 --> 01:17:09,792
You didn't do anything wrong.

835
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:13,337
I should've told you I
was going to see him.

836
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:14,713
Wait, what?

837
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:16,507
I should've asked you.

838
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:20,302
I'm sorry. I just-just
wanted to see him so bad.

839
01:17:20,386 --> 01:17:21,428
I know, it's fine.

840
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:23,806
Okay.

841
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:39,738
You Okay?

842
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:40,823
No.

843
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:46,036
She okay?

844
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,371
What the hell
were you thinking?

845
01:17:47,454 --> 01:17:49,081
She shows up at your house
and you take off with her

846
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:49,999
like that?

847
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:51,750
Listen...

848
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:52,793
It's still kidnapping!

849
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:54,545
That's not what happened.

850
01:17:54,628 --> 01:17:56,297
I didn't even know
she was on the boat.

851
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:57,590
Oh yeah? Tell
that to the judge.

852
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:00,342
If I wanted to take her,
we'd be gone already.

853
01:18:00,426 --> 01:18:03,971
Oh, so this is just a nice
father daughter boat ride, huh?

854
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:05,890
Well, I was gonna take her
back once I could do that

855
01:18:05,973 --> 01:18:06,974
without getting shot.

856
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:09,602
I'm sorry I'm a little
selfish that way.

857
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,103
That's hard to believe
from someone who put

858
01:18:11,187 --> 01:18:12,521
a shark in a lake.

859
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:14,315
You know? People are
dead because of you!

860
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:17,610
Yeah, I know that.

861
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:20,571
But once you and Carly
are off this boat,

862
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:21,947
I'm gonna end this.

863
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:24,617
You're in violation
of your parole.

864
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,035
When we get off this
boat, you're going

865
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:27,203
right back to jail.

866
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:28,621
That's not happening.

867
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:33,209
What would you do to
see your daughter?

868
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:34,126
She's my daughter.

869
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:34,877
What would you
do to see your--

870
01:18:34,919 --> 01:18:35,920
I'd do anything.

871
01:18:36,003 --> 01:18:40,382
Me too. Except I wouldn't
take her away from you.

872
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:44,220
I wouldn't do that to her.

873
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:46,889
You took care of
her when I couldn't.

874
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:49,975
You probably think I hated
you all these years.

875
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:51,852
But that's not even close.

876
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:55,022
You're the best thing
to ever happen to her.

877
01:18:56,815 --> 01:18:57,900
I know that.

878
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:00,986
But I'm still her dad and
I'll do whatever it takes

879
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,488
to be part of her life.

880
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:10,913
Carly!
-Get her!

881
01:19:14,124 --> 01:19:15,292
Go! Go, go, g0!

882
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:23,050
Carly!
-Carly!

883
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:26,887
Carly! Carly!

884
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:38,899
Carly!

885
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:41,360
Behind you!

886
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:47,032
Carly!

887
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:05,175
Found you. You okay?

888
01:20:05,259 --> 01:20:06,552
Alright, let's go back.

889
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:08,887
Okay, you'll be fine.
Just go back to the boat.

890
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:11,348
Just hang on. Hang
on to me, sweetie.

891
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:14,852
Clint!

892
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:20,941
Carly, swim! Swim!

893
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:29,241
Come on, Carly, swim!

894
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:49,678
Dad!

895
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:44,149
Thank you.

896
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:47,986
Shouldn't I be saying that?

897
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:52,074
If you hadn't... Carly...

898
01:21:52,157 --> 01:21:53,492
That thing would've...

899
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:56,620
It didn't. She's
gonna be fine.

900
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:00,082
MQfn!

901
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:03,293
MQfn!

902
01:22:07,297 --> 01:22:09,174
Come on, come on!

903
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:31,613
Hey, miss! Over here!

904
01:22:31,697 --> 01:22:32,823
Lake County Sheriff.

905
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:34,241
We're gonna need to
borrow your phone.

906
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:42,458
Should've seen the fish.

907
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:53,594
They'll be here soon.

908
01:22:57,723 --> 01:22:59,057
What now?

909
01:22:59,141 --> 01:23:00,058
I don't know.

910
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:05,689
Clint, you should go.

911
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:27,169
I'm done running.

912
01:23:29,963 --> 01:23:31,507
I missed too much already.

913
01:23:37,638 --> 01:23:40,641
He saved my life, he
saved Carly's life.

914
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:42,059
He can't spend another
five years in jail

915
01:23:42,142 --> 01:23:44,561
you have to do something
about this, like please...

916
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:56,782
Time to go,
Mr. Gray.

917
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:58,951
Go where? Where
is he going?

918
01:24:00,494 --> 01:24:03,163
We just need to ask him a
few questions, that's all.

919
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:08,627
You're gonna see your dad
real soon, I promise.

920
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:16,343
Love you.

921
01:24:18,262 --> 01:24:19,346
Ready?

922
01:24:32,401 --> 01:24:33,360
You Okay?

923
01:24:35,612 --> 01:24:38,240
Hey, Don...

924
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:41,285
You got your shark.

925
01:24:41,368 --> 01:24:42,619
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

926
01:24:42,703 --> 01:24:46,164
Not a bad night. We cleaned
up the lake and the street.
