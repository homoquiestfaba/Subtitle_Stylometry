 figure out, holding
 at least about nine hostages.

Nine hostages.

Why is the President
so interested?

Well, one of the hostages
 is special.

something to you, okay?

 gonna pull this off.

Get a hold of that
spaced out dipshit
 at the prison.

345
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:51,884
I want to know what
 he's given us here.

346
00:30:51,918 --> 00:30:54,020
-You listen here...
 -Dasilva.

347
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:56,889
I don't give a shit
 what your name is!

348
00:30:56,923 --> 00:30:59,325
-What the hell are you
 trying to pull here?
 -(INAUDIBLE)

349
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:02,461
Come on, Trevanian.
 I mean, I'm in the deep freeze
 for years, okay?

350
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:04,430
You wake me up,
you offer me a pardon.

351
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:07,466
What was I supposed to say?
"Sorry, mister,
you got the wrong guy."

352
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:10,069
Well, he does have a point.

353
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:12,671
-Just get me the hell
 out of here, okay?
 -TREVANIAN: How?

354
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:16,175
"How?" How the hell am I
 supposed to know?
 You got me in this mess.

355
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,677
Now listen to me
 carefully, Dickson.

356
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,313
There's no way that
 we can come and get you
 out at this time.

357
00:31:21,347 --> 00:31:24,550
I suggest that you 
 hide out somewhere 
 until this is over.

358
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:25,918
You understand?

359
00:31:27,153 --> 00:31:29,088
That's your best suggestion?

360
00:31:31,157 --> 00:31:33,325
Boy, you guys really
 got it together.

361
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:37,529
I'm telling you, Dasilva,
 stay out of the way.

362
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:40,166
If the terrorists find you, 
 they'll think 
 you're one of us.

363
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:42,434
You'll be endangering
 the rest of the...

364
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:44,203
Dasilva!
 Dasilva!

365
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,337
He's gone.

366
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:06,592
Check this out.

367
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,297
TREVANIAN: Yes, that's right.

368
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,531
I'll back you up.

369
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:15,001
TREVANIAN: No, that's right.

370
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:17,503
No. No, Margaret.

371
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:20,439
-BLACKWOOD: Ahem!
 -I don't know
 when I'm coming home.

372
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:23,942
Except... Yes.
 Look, I'll call you if I can.

373
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:26,178
Right.

374
00:32:30,016 --> 00:32:33,552
Is this gonna make me
 more unhappy
 than I already am?

375
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:35,287
BOTH: Yeah, pretty much.

376
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:43,495
"Michael Dasilva,
 ex-pro football..."

377
00:32:45,264 --> 00:32:47,766
I knew I'd seen this
son of a bitch before.

378
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:52,071
Yeah, he killed himself
 a redneck in a bar
 and claimed self-defense.

379
00:32:52,104 --> 00:32:53,372
And I guess
 they didn't buy it.

380
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:56,208
TREVANIAN:
 A football player.

381
00:32:56,242 --> 00:32:59,011
I put a goddamn
 football player up there.

382
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:24,170
(SNIFFING) Oh!

383
00:33:24,203 --> 00:33:25,771
Terrific.

384
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:27,473
I could have picked
 the ladies' room.

385
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:35,647

Don't touch the trigger!
 It's a hair-trigger. Don't...

391
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:10,642
Don't worry. I know
 how to handle a gun.

392
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:26,692
Goddamn it, lady!
 You could have killed me.

393

394
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,529
ZANUCHI: Come on, let's go.
Yeah, you scared me.

395
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:44,243
You think he cares
 about you?

396
00:35:44,276 --> 00:35:47,746
He doesn't care
about any of you.
You're all expendable.

397
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:06,198
Yeah. Yeah, it's me.
 Let me talk to him.

398
00:36:06,232 --> 00:36:08,967
I don't care if he is busy,
interrupt him.

399
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,269

 taking her?

 he's one of my men,

you're gonna go ahead
 and do this anyway.

 what difference does it make?

to stay out of the way.

 gonna stick you 
 back in the freezer,

00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:37,115
Unhindered by any
 sense of morality.

513
00:48:39,317 --> 00:48:42,120
And Romulus is that creation.

514
00:48:42,153 --> 00:48:44,122
DASILVA: An android.

515
00:48:44,155 --> 00:48:48,026
You gotta be kidding.
 This psycho's an android?

516
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:49,995
Android, yes.

517
00:48:50,028 --> 00:48:51,296
Psycho, no.

518
00:48:52,563 --> 00:48:55,400
His mind is not disturbed.

519
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:59,404
Merely free of the usual
 social and emotional
 inhibitions.

520
00:49:00,738 --> 00:49:03,441
Well, that's terrific, Doc.

521
00:49:03,474 --> 00:49:05,943
Because this guy's stairs
 definitely do not
 reach the attic.

522
00:49:08,013 --> 00:49:11,482
Romulus is a billion-dollar
 killing machine, Mr. Dasilva.

523
00:49:13,051 --> 00:49:15,753
You have
no chance against him.

524
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:19,224
I'd advise you
 to keep out of his way...

525
00:49:19,257 --> 00:49:22,660
...and mine, until this 
 situation is resolved.

526

Don't be stupid!

530
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,515
Come on! Shoot me. Shoot me!

531
00:50:20,151 --> 00:50:21,719
Do I look like
a goddamned terrorist?

532
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:22,787
Yes.

533
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:27,625
Well, I'm not.

534
00:50:27,658 --> 00:50:30,195
Well, what are you? You a cop?

535
00:50:31,796 --> 00:50:33,064
Not exactly.

536
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,101
FBI?

537
00:50:38,303 --> 00:50:39,304

-Special Forces good guy?
 -(GROANS SOFTLY)

539
00:50:48,146 --> 00:50:53,251
They've been fiddling
 with that computer
 for the last 20 minutes.

540
00:50:53,284 --> 00:50:58,289
They're working on
 a newfangled hot idea to beat
 the android. (SCOFFING)

541
00:50:58,323 --> 00:51:01,092
BLACKWOOD: Yeah, well,
 maybe they're gonna challenge
 him to a game of chess.

542
00:51:01,126 --> 00:51:02,127
Yeah, maybe.

543
00:51:07,632 --> 00:51:09,400
(WHISPERING)
Come on. We're leaving.

544
00:51:09,434 --> 00:51:11,736
Oh... Wait a minute.
 I have to change.

545
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:14,572
We don't have
 any time for that!

546
00:51:14,605 --> 00:51:17,808
Oh, no, I'm not going
 out there looking like this.
 I'd look ridiculous.

547
00:51:17,842 --> 00:51:20,578
DASILVA: You'd look
 a lot worse
 in the morgue, lady.

548
00:51:21,379 --> 00:51:22,747
Close the door.

549
00:51:25,716 --> 00:51:27,618
Please close the door.

550
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:33,658
ZANUCHI: Any luck?
 FRANCO: No,
 I haven't seen him.

551
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:35,493

 Well, let's look this way.

SARAH: Ready.

553
00:51:46,504 --> 00:51:49,174
What is that?

554
00:51:49,207 --> 00:51:51,576
I got food poisoning at
 the French Embassy.
 This is all I have to wear.

555
00:51:52,677 --> 00:51:53,778
-Shoes.
-Shoes.

556
00:51:53,811 --> 00:51:56,281
Lose the shoes.

 think your pushing?
 What are you doing?

558

How do you expect me...

559
00:51:58,716 --> 00:52:00,618
-Listen, lady!
-What?

560
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:02,653
Out there you may be
 the President's daughter,

561
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:06,257
but in here, you're just
 excess baggage.

562
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:08,893
Oh, you think I'm gonna
tie you down.

563

fencing, gymnastics,
 horseback riding and riflery.

565
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,305
Now do you think you can
 keep up with that?

566
00:52:23,441 --> 00:52:26,211
Look, lady, I've had
 a very shitty day.

567
00:52:26,244 --> 00:52:29,880
And if you give me
 anymore trouble,
 I am gonna leave you here.

568
00:52:29,914 --> 00:52:31,316
Got it?

569
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:34,352
Yeah. Got it.

570

One thing...

571
00:52:38,556 --> 00:52:42,660
Keep your paws to yourself.

572
00:52:42,693 --> 00:52:46,597
No, thank you. I don't think
 that I'll wear them,
 as you so politely suggested.

573
00:52:46,631 --> 00:52:48,366
Smart girl.

TREVANIAN: Dasilva.

575
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:52,903
Tell him I'm rescuing you.

576
00:52:55,573 --> 00:52:57,342
He says he's rescuing me.

577
00:53:02,313 --> 00:53:06,251
That crazy, gung ho
bastard's got the girl!

578
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:08,619
Look, Dasilva,
 there's no place
 that you can go.

579
00:53:12,723 --> 00:53:13,924
Dasilva!

-Romulus, this is Kinderman.
 -What the hell are you doing?

-Dasilva is with the girl.
 -Are you crazy?

582
00:53:33,978 --> 00:53:36,013
He's not acting on my orders,
 he's working on his own.
 He has no...

Go!

 like that again,

I won't care what kinda
 clearance you've got,
 I'll bust your ass!

Look, I have one chance,
just one chance
of retrieving Romulus.

593
00:56:15,139 --> 00:56:18,142
And I'm not gonna let you
 or Dasilva stand in my way.

594
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:19,877
Retrieve Romulus?

You're slime.

00:56:24,148 --> 00:56:26,651
You don't care about
 the hostages.

You just want
 your goddamn robot back, huh?

598
00:56:29,487 --> 00:56:32,457
Yeah. That is correct.

599
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:35,626
Just tell me,
 how are you gonna do that?

in the fourth quarter.

seen that done before.

 they should've really
 started you in that game.

I mean, I knew
 that you had an arm.

639
00:59:47,051 --> 00:59:48,252
I had no idea you had
 a pair of legs like that.

 the first quarterback...

 passed to Andrews

 Hirsthill took him down.

Davies, he was smoking
 up your ass.

Now if he'd made
 the touchdown,
 you'd have been dead meat.

 ahead of him.
 He never would've caught me.

Chicken Hawk.

681
01:02:18,168 --> 01:02:20,905
-That's an old
helicopter designation.
-Yeah, yeah.

682
01:02:20,938 --> 01:02:24,408
Well, it makes sense.
 A helicopter's the only way
 they could get out of here.

683
01:02:27,344 --> 01:02:29,880
Harris, keep us posted.
 Come on.

684
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:05,415
-Well?
-No, no. Nothing more.

685
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:07,918
Right, if Romulus is gonna
 give his pilot an all-clear

686
01:03:07,952 --> 01:03:10,955
15 minutes before
 he's due to pick him up,

687
01:03:10,988 --> 01:03:13,991
that chopper's got to be
 parked within this radius.

688
01:03:14,024 --> 01:03:16,260
There are only
 a couple of possibilities.

689
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:17,895
The dump site
 and the old factory
 on the east side.

690
01:03:17,928 --> 01:03:19,263
The rest is residential.

691
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:20,931
All right, check it out.
We got exactly one hour

692
01:03:20,965 --> 01:03:22,166
to pull something
out of the hat.

693
01:03:22,199 --> 01:03:23,300
You think if we pull
 this one off,

694
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:26,103
there's a nice,
big, fat bonus?

695
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:27,872
If we pull this off,
 we'll be lucky to keep
 what's left of our nuts.

696
01:03:27,905 --> 01:03:29,373
I hear you.

697
01:03:29,406 --> 01:03:30,440
Come on,
let's get out of here!

698
01:03:32,977 --> 01:03:35,245
Trevanian, where are
 those men going?

699
01:03:41,185 --> 01:03:44,388
That information comes
 on a need to know basis
 and you don't need to know.

700
01:04:01,538 --> 01:04:04,241
Excuse me,
 I don't mean to ask
 a trivial question but...

701
01:04:04,274 --> 01:04:07,411
Shh! I think I just
 found a way out of here.

702
01:04:10,114 --> 01:04:13,350
Oh, you've made a decision.

703
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:15,986
That's because I'm concerned
 about your future.

704
01:04:19,323 --> 01:04:23,928
Mr. President, I believe
we have one chance
of overcoming Romulus.

705
01:04:23,961 --> 01:04:27,164
But it will have to be done
face to face.

706
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:29,066
And the only possible
 opportunity

707
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:31,969
is during the exchange for
 the money for the hostages.

708
01:04:34,004 --> 01:04:37,474
Yes, Mr. President,
 I'm quite aware of that.

709
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:40,610
But this will work.
 I can absolutely guarantee it.

710
01:04:45,182 --> 01:04:47,151
Thank you, Mr. President.

711
01:04:48,452 --> 01:04:50,620
You won't regret
this decision.

712
01:04:55,325 --> 01:04:57,227
The money's on its way.

713
01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:08,205
Pardon me.

714
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:10,340
Can you tell me where
 the men's room is, please?

715
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:14,644
Oh, so sorry, I thought
you were a man.

716
01:05:14,678 --> 01:05:17,982
Come on, lady,
 let's not go
 through this again.

717
01:05:21,018 --> 01:05:23,153
Give me the gun.

718
01:05:23,187 --> 01:05:25,422
Come and get it!

719
01:05:25,455 --> 01:05:26,523
-(CRIES OUT IN SHOCK)
 -Yes!

720
01:05:27,457 --> 01:05:28,492
Bye-bye!

721

Back! Up! Up!

722
01:05:46,743 --> 01:05:48,412
Oh! Hold back! Off!

723
01:05:55,252 --> 01:05:56,286
Oh!

724
01:06:12,102 --> 01:06:14,571
Trevanian, I'm sending
 the girl down now.

725
01:06:15,572 --> 01:06:16,673
Yeah!

726
01:06:19,676 --> 01:06:23,447
You bring her down,
 I'll buy you the biggest
 goddamn beer you ever saw.

727
01:06:28,085 --> 01:06:29,119
See ya.

728
01:06:35,592 --> 01:06:36,760
You're crazy.

729
01:06:38,095 --> 01:06:39,363
Certifiable.

730
01:06:41,365 --> 01:06:42,532
(COCKS GUN) Good.

731
01:06:43,567 --> 01:06:46,236
Let's go.

732
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:48,405
Hey, Dasilva,
 what're you waiting for?

733
01:06:48,438 --> 01:06:51,075
No more heroics.

734
01:06:51,108 --> 01:06:53,210
You want your pardon, 
 you get the hell 
 outta there now!

735
01:06:53,243 --> 01:06:54,644
You get outta there now!

736
01:07:00,684 --> 01:07:01,718
Romulus,

737
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,055
this is Kinderman.

738
01:07:06,656 --> 01:07:10,394
Kinderman.

739
01:07:10,427 --> 01:07:12,729
It isn't every day 
 you get the chance 
 to talk to your creator.

740
01:07:14,431 --> 01:07:15,665
Should I be honored?

741
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:20,304
Romulus, you can't win.

742
01:07:20,337 --> 01:07:21,805
Oh, can't I?

743
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:23,173
KINDERMAN:
 I know your limitations.

744
01:07:24,608 --> 01:07:26,710
You can be brought down.

745
01:07:26,743 --> 01:07:29,846
Blind optimism.

746
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:32,116
It is such an 
 endearing quality.

747
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:37,721
Why are you doing this?
 You have no interest in money.

748
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:42,726
ROMULUS: I've learned 
 that money is freedom.

749
01:07:45,462 --> 01:07:47,497
What was my future with you?

750
01:07:49,533 --> 01:07:51,067
A toy soldier?

751
01:07:52,236 --> 01:07:53,637
Obedient...

752
01:07:55,305 --> 01:07:57,374
Expendable.

753
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:59,543
There's a lot of me
 in you, Romulus.

754
01:08:01,445 --> 01:08:03,747
I don't wish to
 see you destroyed.

755
01:08:05,715 --> 01:08:07,351
Oh, am I touched.

756
01:08:09,353 --> 01:08:12,222
Or...

757
01:08:12,256 --> 01:08:15,459
Are you concerned with your 
 billion dollar investment?

758
01:08:18,895 --> 01:08:21,698
Then I'll have to bring
 you down, Romulus.

759
01:08:21,731 --> 01:08:25,101
Then who better to do it 
 than my creator?

760
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:28,805
Or I will have to destroy you.

761
01:08:35,645 --> 01:08:38,482
But what if...

762
01:08:38,515 --> 01:08:42,352
The creation destroys 
 the creator?

763
01:08:44,688 --> 01:08:46,723

 true freedom.

01:19:22,325 --> 01:19:25,128
You're a popular man,
Mr. President.

855
01:19:25,161 --> 01:19:27,330
Your policies of
 international appeasement

856
01:19:27,363 --> 01:19:29,365
have earned you acclaim
the world over.

857
01:19:31,467 --> 01:19:34,938

 touting for votes,

 have been laughing at us.

Many of us do not share
 your vision, Mr. President.

861
01:19:47,183 --> 01:19:50,186
So that when
 you step down from office,

862
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:53,990
you'll make way for
a stronger government.

863

 this country great again.

864

 of stepping down!

 settle something with
