We're gonna have to reroute to LAX this time. </ i> 

60
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.180
No! No, no, no! Tell him

61
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.100
Tell him we have to land right now! 
My husband needs a doctor. Please!

62
00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.630
- Do you feel a pulse?

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.840

I'll take care. Sit right here

66
00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.160
- Stay away! Stay away! - Stay away!
- Step aside!

67
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:54.270
- You need to tie him down right now
- What's wrong with you? Marcus, wake up!

68
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.530
- Stop!
- Hey, hey, hey!

69
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.150
US air marshall.
You need to return to your seat

70
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.810
- You don't understand. - Take your seat.
- He's dangerous.

71
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.060
Take your seat, now!
All of you, sit down, now!

72
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:12.670
Clear!

73
00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:19.550
Clear!

74
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.230
Don't let him bite you

75
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.930
- Get out of here! Get out of here!
- Over here! Get over here!

76
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.700
Push it!

77
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.750
- Close the door!
Close the door! - Lock it!

78
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15.630
Oh my God!

79
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.590
He bit me.

80
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:23.320
- Tie her down, now!
- She's hurt. We need to help her.

81
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:27.490
Tie her down, then help her.
What heppened to him will happen to her.

82
00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:34.650
Hey, come on, take a sit

83
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.490
We have to land the plane

84
00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:46.230
Tell the captain!

85
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50.960
Already tried.
It's not just Phoenix. 

86
00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.840
Lights are going out everywhere.

87
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:57.550
There is no where to land.

88
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.460
How did you know?

89
00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.270
Come on, let's go

90
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.120
I just want to see my husband.

91
00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:29.690
- Ma'am, your husband is sick.
- So help him!

92
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.580
There's nothing we can do.

93
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:40.040
Let me tell him,
That I love him. That I'm here

94
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.200
Let me...!

95
00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:51.810
Marcus!

96
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54.250
Marcus!

97
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.050
It's me, dear.
I love you!

98
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.280
Everyone, take a seat.

99
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.960
I don't hear anything anymore.
Marcus?

100
00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.640
- No, don't! - Marcus?
He's died! - He's dead!

101
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.600
Get back! Just-get back!

102
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.710
Move, move!

103
00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:35.690
Everybody stay back!

104
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.730
The head! Shoot him in the head!

105
00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:06.920
She's dying.

106
00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.120
Oh my God!

107
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.140
You killed her.

108
00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.330
I saved her.

109
00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:46.440
Get to a sit!

110
00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:08.610
I'm Sorry!

111
00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:15.140
I got the last seat.
I got your mom's seat.

112
00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:19.650
I'm sorry!
You should be with her.

113
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:26.610
She's probably with my dad right now.

114
00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.930
And you'll be there soon.

115
