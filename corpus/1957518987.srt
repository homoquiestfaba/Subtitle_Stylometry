179
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:54,670
It's not a very clean job,
but she needs a grave dug.

180
00:11:54,844 --> 00:11:56,454
Don't imagine it pays much,
either.

181
00:11:56,628 --> 00:11:59,283
- Aw, I'm sure it will be
more than fair.

182
00:11:59,457 --> 00:12:01,895
- Well, I'd better tell the wife
about Eliza's loss.

183
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:04,898
She'll want to put something
together for them.

184
00:12:05,072 --> 00:12:06,203
It was a pleasure
to meet you, Gabe.

185
00:12:06,377 --> 00:12:07,596
- Likewise, Tom.

186
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:14,472
- I don't know what's going
to become of her.

187
00:12:14,646 --> 00:12:16,910
Her husband passed away
five years ago,

188
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:19,086
and now her father-in-law's
up and died.

189
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,611
Poor little thing, she's got
them two children at home,

190

crop to bring in,

191
00:12:24,613 --> 00:12:26,310
and nobody to help her.

192
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,106

193
00:12:40,194 --> 00:12:41,891
- Sheriff.

194
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:45,242
- This is the man I was
telling you about yesterday.

195
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,288
- Mrs. Wyatt.
Gabriel Harper.

196
00:12:55,252 --> 00:12:56,776
- If you'll give me
just a moment,

197
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,648
I'll show you both
to the family burial plot.

198
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,355
- Who's that with the sheriff?

199
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:13,270
- A man named Gabriel Harper.
I've never seen him before.

200
00:13:13,444 --> 00:13:14,619
- Neither have I.

201

202
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,757
Uh... I'm gonna show them out
to the family plot.

203
00:13:21,931 --> 00:13:23,672
Can you make sure that
the children are up and dressed?

204
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:25,805
- Of course.

205
00:13:25,979 --> 00:13:30,113
- The minister's gonna be here
in a few hours, and I...

206
00:13:30,287 --> 00:13:32,420
[Sighs]

207
00:13:32,594 --> 00:13:34,639
I have a lot to do before
everybody gets here. [Chokes up]

208
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:43,648
- Be strong, Eliza.

209
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:49,306
Every blade of grass
has an angel,

210
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,656

"grow."

212
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,357
With some help
from the good lord,

213
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:59,099
we'll get through this.

214
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:00,665
You believe me, don't you?

215
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,108
- I'm afraid I don't have much

216
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:11,024
in the way to pay you,
Mr. Harper.

217
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:13,548
- Ah, a good meal and a roof
over my head tonight's

218
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:15,202
more than I can ask for.

219
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:19,162
- Well, fair enough.

220
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:21,208
This is where we'd like frank
to be buried.

221
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:22,513
Next to his son.

222
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:24,602
- Yes, ma'am.

223
00:14:24,776 --> 00:14:27,257
- Well, it will take a few hours
for us to dig it.

224
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:28,345
- Us?

225
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:29,694
- Yes, ma'am.

226
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,435
He's a hard worker,

227
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:34,395
but I don't expect he'll do it
all by himself.

228
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:37,006
Ask Luke to bring me
a cup of coffee, would you?

229
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:41,619
- Thank you, sheriff.

230
00:14:41,793 --> 00:14:44,187

Mr. Wakefield?

Thank you.

Is grandpa in heaven with dad?

- Of course.
Why would you ask that?

251

He was always yelling
at all of us.

253
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:32,138
And yesterday,
he was so angry with Luke,

254
00:17:32,312 --> 00:17:33,878
that I'm worried
he won't get into heaven.

255

If having a short temper
was something

that would keep a man
out of heaven,

259
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:46,804
likely half the saints would be
on the outside looking in.

Your grandpa loved both of you

Now, the good lord
wouldn't keep you out of heaven

266

just for wanting what's best
for your grandchildren.

267
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,954
Certainly not for loving them
that much.

I'll come visit here,

is too much.

00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,688
My home and family.

354
00:23:05,862 --> 00:23:07,995
- Fine family we are.

355
00:23:09,126 --> 00:23:11,564
Not much of a home, either.

356
00:23:11,738 --> 00:23:16,699
- You know, I like a home
that has a few creaks in it.

357
00:23:16,873 --> 00:23:19,920
It makes you feel
like it's lived in.

358
00:23:20,094 --> 00:23:22,836
By the way, same with family.

359
00:23:25,229 --> 00:23:26,535
[Laughs]

360
00:23:31,105 --> 00:23:32,193
[Rooster crowing]

361
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:39,330
[Chop]

362
00:23:39,505 --> 00:23:40,810
- Sorry if I woke you up.

363
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:42,508
- No.

364
00:23:42,682 --> 00:23:43,944
When you live on a farm
all your life,

365
00:23:44,118 --> 00:23:45,859
you're up before the sun
out of habit.

366
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:47,121
- [Sighs]
[Horse flutters]

367
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:48,557
I couldn't help but notice

368
00:23:48,731 --> 00:23:50,733
how low you were on wood
in the barn.

369
00:23:50,907 --> 00:23:53,344
As cold as it was last night,

370
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:55,390
can only imagine how bad
it's gonna be this winter.

371
00:23:55,564 --> 00:23:57,784
Thought I'd get you started on
a decent supply of split wood.

372
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:01,396
- Excuse me if I'm being
too forward, but...

373
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,137
What's such a decent man
like yourself

374
00:24:03,311 --> 00:24:04,747
doing living the way you are?

375
00:24:04,921 --> 00:24:06,488
- How's that?

376
00:24:06,662 --> 00:24:09,317
- Well, you know...
Out in the world, no home,

377
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:11,841
wandering from place to place.

378
00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:14,409
- I wish I had an easy answer
for you, but I don't.

379
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:17,412
- So, you're not headed
anywhere in particular?

380
00:24:17,586 --> 00:24:19,153
Nobody out there
waiting for you?

381
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:21,416
- No, ma'am.

382
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,331
- Well, perhaps
I could convince you

383
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:26,552
to get off the road for a while
and stay here.

384
00:24:26,726 --> 00:24:28,989
We ain't got much, but we could
give you room and board

385
00:24:29,163 --> 00:24:31,165
for helping out around here.

386
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:32,993
Eliza's in a tough spot,

387
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:36,213
and I don't think she'd ask
for help from anyone.

388
00:24:36,387 --> 00:24:40,217
You know, sometimes it takes
a crazy old woman like myself

389
00:24:40,391 --> 00:24:43,264
to do the speaking for the likes
of people like you and her.

390
00:24:43,438 --> 00:24:47,486
- Well, I could use a place
on a steady basis.

391
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,139
I've been on the road
a long time.

392
00:24:49,313 --> 00:24:51,054
- Good.

393
00:24:51,228 --> 00:24:52,926
Then why don't you go
to the pump and get washed up

394
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,493
and come on in the house
for breakfast?

395
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,146
- Oh, no, ma'am.
- Mr. Harper, if you think

396
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,105
you're too filthy to sit
at our table,

397
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:59,628
then clean yourself up.

398
00:24:59,802 --> 00:25:02,370
I won't have you eating outside
anymore.

399
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:03,980
- Yes, ma'am.

400
00:25:04,154 --> 00:25:06,243
- People around here call me
aunt Batty.

401
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:09,203
- Batty?
- You heard me.

402
00:25:09,377 --> 00:25:10,596
Now, get washed up.

403
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,032
I'm gonna go in
and talk to Eliza

404
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:13,903
and finish getting breakfast
ready.

405
00:25:17,994 --> 00:25:19,996
- You asked him to stay on.

406
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,128
How are we going to pay him?

407
00:25:21,302 --> 00:25:23,391
- Room and board.

408
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,436
One extra mouth to feed
and a room is a good deal

409
00:25:25,611 --> 00:25:27,874
for a man to help us bring in
the crop, if you ask me.

410
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:31,704
- I'm starting to see
why frank called you Batty.

411
00:25:31,878 --> 00:25:34,837
- Sometimes it just takes
a freethinker like myself

412
00:25:35,011 --> 00:25:36,491
to cut through things.

413
00:25:36,665 --> 00:25:38,362
- No. No, I cannot have
a strange man

414
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,842
living in this house.

415
00:25:40,016 --> 00:25:42,062
- Dear...

416
00:25:42,236 --> 00:25:43,542
What else are you gonna do?

417
00:25:43,716 --> 00:25:45,456
You're not
thinking this through.

418
00:25:45,631 --> 00:25:47,633
This is so sudden,
but if we don't have

419
00:25:47,807 --> 00:25:49,504
someone else to help us run
this place,

420
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:51,419
we're going to lose
whatever else we have left.

421
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:52,463
- [Knocking]

422
00:25:52,638 --> 00:25:53,552
- Come in.

423
00:25:54,988 --> 00:25:56,206
- Morning.

424
00:26:00,036 --> 00:26:02,125
I'm sorry. Should I leave?
- No, no.

425
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:04,432
You're just in time
for breakfast. Sit down.

426
00:26:16,052 --> 00:26:17,358
- Thank you.

427
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:23,320
Father, we thank thee
that thy kingdom

428
00:26:23,494 --> 00:26:27,934
is neither meat nor drink
but righteousness.

429
00:26:28,108 --> 00:26:29,239
Peace and joy forever.

430
00:26:29,413 --> 00:26:30,371
Amen.

431
00:26:30,545 --> 00:26:31,851
- Amen.
- Amen.

432
00:26:32,025 --> 00:26:33,026
- Amen.

433
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,335
- Are you a hobo?

434
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:40,207
- Luke, watch yourself.

435
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:42,078
- No, sir.

436
00:26:42,252 --> 00:26:44,254
But I guess
I sure do look like one.

437
00:26:44,428 --> 00:26:47,257
- 'Cause people around here
don't like hobos and bums.

438
00:26:47,431 --> 00:26:49,520
- All right, that's enough,
both of you.

439
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:51,610
Let's let Mr. Harper
eat in peace.

440
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:54,961
- What's your first name?

441
00:26:55,135 --> 00:26:56,745
- Gabriel.
Gabriel.

442
00:26:56,919 --> 00:26:58,268
But my friends and
most folks just call me Gabe.

443
00:26:58,442 --> 00:27:00,140
- Like the angel.

444
00:27:00,314 --> 00:27:01,924
- Well, my mother and grandma
used to say so,

445
00:27:02,098 --> 00:27:03,578
so maybe I am.

446
00:27:03,752 --> 00:27:05,536
- My aunt says we're her angels.
- Hmm.

447
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:07,277
Is that so?

448
00:27:07,451 --> 00:27:09,323
Well, then, fellow angels,

449
00:27:09,497 --> 00:27:10,498
what are your names?

450
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,935
- I'm Becky, and he's Luke.

451
00:27:13,109 --> 00:27:16,983
- It's a pleasure
to meet both of you. Oh!

452
00:27:17,157 --> 00:27:20,029
- Ma! Luke just poked Gabe
with his fork.

453
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:21,552
- He poked him?

454
00:27:21,727 --> 00:27:23,337
- Yeah. For no reason at all.

455
00:27:23,511 --> 00:27:24,947
- But I did have a reason.

456
00:27:25,121 --> 00:27:27,558
I wanted to see
if he was really an angel.

457
00:27:27,733 --> 00:27:29,952
- Luke, say you're sorry
right now.

458
00:27:30,126 --> 00:27:31,345
- I'm sorry.

459
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:33,652
- No, no harm done.

460
00:27:33,826 --> 00:27:35,305
- Look, I think Gabe
has probably had enough

461
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:37,525
of you two by now, so...

462
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:39,309
Finish your breakfast
and get moving.

463
00:27:39,483 --> 00:27:41,007
We've got a lot
to get done today.

464
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,626
- I know it isn't my place
to say, but...

465
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,106
But maybe you and the children
should take

466
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,369
at least one more day
to yourselves.

467
00:27:55,543 --> 00:27:57,284
I can get to work
if you show me where to start.

468
00:27:57,458 --> 00:27:58,981
- [Sighs]

469
00:27:59,155 --> 00:28:01,027
Mr. Harper.
- Please, Gabe.

470
00:28:01,201 --> 00:28:03,638
- Gabe.

471
00:28:03,812 --> 00:28:05,640
Do you know
what you're getting into here?

472
00:28:05,814 --> 00:28:08,512
We have little or no chance of
making it through the harvest.

473
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,646
I have no money to pay you.

474
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,518
And I've nothing of value
to offer.

475
00:28:18,348 --> 00:28:20,655
- Excuse me, ma'am.
I understand your concerns.

476
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:23,223
But the offer Batty made me
was room and board

477
00:28:23,397 --> 00:28:25,225
in exchange for helping you out
around here.

478
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:27,575
That's more than generous enough
an offer for me.

479
00:28:32,232 --> 00:28:33,537
Both: [Groaning]

480
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,582
- Just put it down there.

481
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:36,366
- [Groaning]

482
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:41,676
- Oop. Lost one.

483
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,897
- All right.
I'll get it later.

484
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:52,295
[Groaning]

485
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:03,219
[Straining] Yeah, last one.

486
00:29:03,393 --> 00:29:05,178
Ok.

487
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:07,006
Ooh!

488
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:11,271
[Breathing heavily]

489
00:29:11,445 --> 00:29:12,751
- Afternoon, folks!

490
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:15,144
- Sheriff.

491
00:29:15,318 --> 00:29:16,711
- Gabe.

492
00:29:16,885 --> 00:29:18,060
Can I talk to you a minute,
please?

493
00:29:24,197 --> 00:29:25,720
- Sheriff?

494
00:29:25,894 --> 00:29:28,114
- Son, you know,
I was kind of surprised

495
00:29:28,288 --> 00:29:30,203
when I got that call from Batty
this morning.

496
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:32,509
Now, you seem to be
a decent sort of fellow,

497
00:29:32,683 --> 00:29:35,512
but I want you to know exactly
what you're getting into.

498
00:29:35,686 --> 00:29:37,340
Now, Batty means well,

499
00:29:37,514 --> 00:29:40,691
but I don't want to give
these folks any false hopes.

500
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:43,564
Most of the people around here

501
00:29:43,738 --> 00:29:46,785
are having trouble surviving
nowadays.

502
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:48,656
So if you made them a promise
to stick around here

503
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,701
until the harvest is in,

504
00:29:50,876 --> 00:29:52,529
you've got to do exactly that.

505
00:29:52,703 --> 00:29:54,227
- I told them I'd work
through the harvest.

506
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:55,663
I intend to do so.

507
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:57,970
- All right.

508
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:00,233
But when you made those people
a promise,

509
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:02,670
you made that same promise
to me.

510
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:05,499
And I intend for you to keep it.

511
00:30:05,673 --> 00:30:08,154
- Well, I won't let them down.

512
00:30:08,328 --> 00:30:09,633
Or you.

513
00:30:11,331 --> 00:30:13,507
- Good.

514
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:14,638
You'd best get back to work.

515
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,468
- Sheriff.

516
00:30:20,383 --> 00:30:23,430
- I'll be back in a few days
to see how y'all are doin'!

517
00:30:39,533 --> 00:30:42,231
[Chopping noises]

518
00:31:14,524 --> 00:31:17,484
[Rooster crowing]

519
00:31:19,486 --> 00:31:21,183
- Mama, can we do
some reading tonight?

520
00:31:21,357 --> 00:31:25,057
- Certainly.
- Ohh!

521
00:31:25,231 --> 00:31:26,972
- Now, Luke, if you don't
practice your reading,

522
00:31:27,146 --> 00:31:28,451
you're never going
to get good at it.

523
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:29,844
- But, mom...

524
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:31,977
- No "but, mom"s,
you understand?

525
00:31:32,151 --> 00:31:33,326
Now, please,
go on out to the barn

526
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,588
and get Gabe for breakfast.

527
00:31:34,762 --> 00:31:36,068

- No.

It's just a fever, that's all.

532

Uh, I want you two
to go back out

yesterday

- Yes, inside.

- Good.

Jack is very alone in the world.

to talk?

to come out here

was going.

00:38:59,206 --> 00:39:01,251
I doubt if, uh...

646
00:39:01,426 --> 00:39:05,734
Frank ever talked to you much
about family finances.

647
00:39:05,908 --> 00:39:09,999
It wasn't even his way to talk
to me, unless he had to.

648
00:39:10,173 --> 00:39:12,088
Since frank had no will,

649
00:39:12,262 --> 00:39:15,309
his grandchildren
will inherit the farm,

650
00:39:15,483 --> 00:39:17,877
which means you'll have
a substantial payment

651
00:39:18,051 --> 00:39:19,748
on the mortgage.

652
00:39:24,492 --> 00:39:27,887
Now, normally, we could wait
until after the harvest was in,

653
00:39:28,061 --> 00:39:31,107
but, because of the state
of banking,

654
00:39:31,281 --> 00:39:33,893
a number of institutions
have had to call in

655
00:39:34,067 --> 00:39:37,287
their outstanding debts early.

656
00:39:37,462 --> 00:39:41,857
- How long do I have?
- Less than 30 days.

657
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:43,381

658
00:39:43,555 --> 00:39:45,121
to bring in the bulk
of the harvest.

659
00:39:45,295 --> 00:39:47,733

It's not my call anymore.

- Eliza, let me be frank.

667
00:40:03,662 --> 00:40:07,579
The bank in San Francisco could
try to foreclose this property.

for the whole spread

would you sell?

- How much could I get?

672
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,334
- Enough to cover
what you owe my bank

673
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:26,293
and the bank in San Francisco,

674
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:28,382
and maybe a little extra
for you and the children

675
00:40:28,556 --> 00:40:33,126
to set up a small home
close to town.

676
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,954
- And then what would we do?

677
00:40:35,128 --> 00:40:39,045
- People in this town
never liked frank that much,

678
00:40:39,219 --> 00:40:42,178
but they'd bend over backwards
to help you and the children.

679
00:40:42,352 --> 00:40:43,919

can barely afford

680

to keep their own homes
and land.

For anything you can do.

690

wanting to call the loans early.

692
00:41:33,621 --> 00:41:35,101
Is there anything I can do
to help?

693
00:41:37,451 --> 00:41:40,236
- Oh, you... you're already
doing more than I can ask.

694
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,369
- I'm not doing anything
that you and your family

695
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:44,327
aren't willing to do yourselves.

696
00:41:48,462 --> 00:41:51,900
- Think it's about time we
got you into some newer clothes.

697

Come on.

00:42:12,312 --> 00:42:15,445
- "For now we see

706
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,536
through a glass..."

707
00:42:21,016 --> 00:42:23,062
- [Sighs]

708
00:42:23,236 --> 00:42:24,933
It's a little more respectable.

709
00:42:28,633 --> 00:42:31,070
- Well, this is
a different cover to judge.

710
00:42:35,465 --> 00:42:37,424
I think that's going to be
all for tonight.

711
00:42:37,598 --> 00:42:39,992
Why don't you all go up
and get ready for bed,

712
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:41,254
and I'll be up
to tuck you in shortly.

713
00:42:41,428 --> 00:42:43,299
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

714
00:42:43,473 --> 00:42:45,693
- Goodnight, Luke.
- Goodnight.

715
00:42:51,743 --> 00:42:54,006
- You have
a wonderful family here, Eliza.

716
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,095
A good life.

717
00:42:56,269 --> 00:42:58,445
It'd be a shame
to see it all slip away.

718
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:02,492
Now, the way I see it is,
we double our efforts tomorrow,

719
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:05,539
we stand a fighting chance
to bring in your harvest,

720
00:43:05,713 --> 00:43:08,237
raise money,
and hold off the bank.

721
00:43:08,411 --> 00:43:09,891
- I don't know.

722
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,987
- Well, maybe I haven't had

723
00:43:19,161 --> 00:43:20,510
anything worth fighting for
in a while,

724
00:43:20,685 --> 00:43:23,252
but, to me, this place, you...

725
00:43:23,426 --> 00:43:25,254
The kids...

726
00:43:25,428 --> 00:43:27,387
Are worth doing all I can for.

727
00:43:34,133 --> 00:43:37,353
- Well, we could at least say
we gave it a try.

728
00:43:37,527 --> 00:43:39,007
- So, what do we do next?

729
00:43:39,181 --> 00:43:42,010
- Well, when we have
most of the harvest in,

730
00:43:42,184 --> 00:43:44,578
I'll call the wholesalers
that frank used to work with,

731
00:43:44,752 --> 00:43:49,452
and they'll come out
and assess the yield,

732
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:50,889
and make us an offer.

733
00:43:51,063 --> 00:43:53,369
- Well, then,

734
00:43:53,543 --> 00:43:55,502
we have a ton more work
ahead of us.

735
00:43:58,592 --> 00:44:06,600
â™ª

736
00:44:24,444 --> 00:44:25,837
- Right.

737
00:44:26,011 --> 00:44:27,665
- They're going to need
these lunches.

738
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,145
The kids have been out there
with Gabe since sunup.

739
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,018
[Kids laughing]

740
00:44:33,192 --> 00:44:35,020
- [Taunting] Ha ha!

741
00:44:38,588 --> 00:44:40,416
- I was out
on the Atlantic ocean,

742
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:42,114
a ship called the troop carrier.

743
00:44:42,288 --> 00:44:44,246
- Were you a soldier?
- Yes, I was.

744
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:47,206
My brother,
we're off to the war,

745
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,425
fight the Germans.

746
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,297
And we'd never been
on the ocean before.

747
00:44:59,305 --> 00:45:00,088
- Hey, Gabe, catch!

748
00:45:04,397 --> 00:45:05,528
Throw this one hard.

749
00:45:08,662 --> 00:45:11,056
- Ooh! He hit it! It went far!
- [Laughing]

750
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:13,014
- You got to get the ball,
he's coming home!

751
00:45:13,188 --> 00:45:15,364
You got to get him at the plate!

752
00:45:15,538 --> 00:45:16,844
- You're out!
- [Laughing]

753
00:45:19,412 --> 00:45:21,109
[Horse whinnies]

754
00:45:26,898 --> 00:45:35,428
- "And Susie at the scene
of the acc..I...Dent..."

755
00:45:35,602 --> 00:45:37,517
- Yeah, you remember that one.

756
00:45:42,914 --> 00:45:46,918
- "George Herman Ruth
was just 19 years old

757
00:45:47,092 --> 00:45:51,661
"when he was discovered
by a minor league scout.

758
00:45:51,836 --> 00:45:56,666
"He was so young that the scout
nicknamed him 'the babe.'

759
00:45:56,841 --> 00:46:01,410
"he will surely be remembered
as the greatest baseball player

760
00:46:01,584 --> 00:46:03,499
"of all time.

761
00:46:03,673 --> 00:46:05,501
"When people think of baseball,

762
00:46:05,675 --> 00:46:10,115
they will always think
of one name... 'The babe.'"

763
00:46:10,289 --> 00:46:14,336
- oh! That is so great!
[Laughing]

764
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:16,686
- I am so proud of you.

765
00:46:16,861 --> 00:46:19,298
- Gabe's been helping me
read better.

766
00:46:19,472 --> 00:46:20,647
- Gabe wants Luke to read
on his breaks

767
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:23,476
instead of just sitting down.

768
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:24,694
- Oh, he does, does he?

769
00:46:24,869 --> 00:46:26,653
- You know what, mom?

770
00:46:26,827 --> 00:46:28,307
When I grow up, I want to be
a baseball player,

771
00:46:28,481 --> 00:46:29,612
just like babe.

772
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,658
- Well, right now you need to go

773
00:46:31,832 --> 00:46:33,355
and have some lunch
with aunt Batty.

774
00:46:33,529 --> 00:46:35,531
- I'm reading to Gabe.
Can't I stay?

775
00:46:35,705 --> 00:46:38,099
- You've got a lot of work
to do, Luke.

776
00:46:38,273 --> 00:46:39,709
Why don't you go get some lunch?

777
00:46:39,884 --> 00:46:41,537
We'll come back out
and finish the work.

778
00:46:41,711 --> 00:46:43,583
Maybe we'll have some time
to throw the ball around.

779
00:46:43,757 --> 00:46:45,454
- Ok.
- Come on, Becky.

780
00:46:45,628 --> 00:46:47,152
Let's go.

781
00:46:47,326 --> 00:46:48,588
We'll be back soon.

782
00:46:55,421 --> 00:46:57,292
- [Sighs]

783
00:46:57,466 --> 00:46:58,685
- He's a good boy.

784
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:00,469
- Thank you for helping him.

785
00:47:00,643 --> 00:47:02,732
Luke's had such a hard time
with his reading.

786
00:47:02,907 --> 00:47:06,127
- Well, I was a lot like him
when I was his age.

787
00:47:06,301 --> 00:47:08,521
I had terrible grades in school.

788
00:47:08,695 --> 00:47:10,523
We had this cook
worked for our family.

789
00:47:10,697 --> 00:47:12,525
She took me under her wing.

790
00:47:12,699 --> 00:47:14,570
She used to cook supper.

791
00:47:14,744 --> 00:47:16,181
She'd make me sit up
on the kitchen counter,

792
00:47:16,355 --> 00:47:17,704
recite poetry to her.

793
00:47:17,878 --> 00:47:20,707
Yeats. Tennyson.

794
00:47:20,881 --> 00:47:22,274
Shelley.

795
00:47:23,797 --> 00:47:25,494
Yep.

796
00:47:25,668 --> 00:47:27,496
Then my dad found out about it

797
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:29,324
and had her fired.

798
00:47:29,498 --> 00:47:32,545
- That's horrible.
- Yeah, it was.

799
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:34,590
It was, but I think
my father did what he did

800
00:47:34,764 --> 00:47:37,593
more out of shame than spite.

801
00:47:37,767 --> 00:47:39,378
You know, he just couldn't
grasp the fact

802
00:47:39,552 --> 00:47:42,598
that people could be kind
for the sake of kindness.

803
00:47:42,772 --> 00:47:44,600
- Sounds a lot like frank.

804
00:47:44,774 --> 00:47:47,821
- Yeah, well, many men are.

805
00:47:47,995 --> 00:47:49,692
- So, are you still in touch
with your father?

806
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,521
- No, not for a while.

807
00:48:04,446 --> 00:48:07,275

- [Laughing]

810
00:48:29,341 --> 00:48:30,472
I got you!

811
00:48:30,646 --> 00:48:31,473
- Luke's taken to Gabe.

812
00:48:31,647 --> 00:48:33,432
- No, no, no!

813
00:48:33,606 --> 00:48:34,694
- He thinks he's an angel.

814
00:48:34,868 --> 00:48:38,567
- Downright handsome, as well.

[Bell ringing]

818
00:48:49,752 --> 00:48:51,580
- ...another dress.

819
00:48:51,754 --> 00:48:54,409
Ok. Come here.

820
00:48:54,583 --> 00:48:55,933
Both: [Laughing]

821
00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:24,265
I can't believe I'm doing this.

822
00:49:24,439 --> 00:49:25,701
He could walk in here
any minute.

823
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:27,225
- Well, then start reading.

824
00:49:27,399 --> 00:49:28,269
- Ok.

825
00:49:28,443 --> 00:49:29,836
Uh... ok.

826
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:31,664
"Jack had been to war

- Yeah.

- Hey, Luke.

00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,535

in the corner for us?

843

- Ok.

- Hopeful?

00:50:32,507 --> 00:50:35,336
- No, that doesn't fit.
- See if this one fits over.

850
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:37,338
- That works.
- Yeah.

851
00:50:39,732 --> 00:50:42,909

that man a little better.

rolling around in your head.

All right.

00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:19,250
- Come in.

Eliza.

857
00:51:26,387 --> 00:51:29,390
- Gabe, do you mind
if we talk for a bit?

858
00:51:29,564 --> 00:51:30,739
- Uh, no.

859
00:51:37,529 --> 00:51:39,096
Please.

- [Sighs]

861
00:51:48,148 --> 00:51:51,586
There's something that I...
Been wanting to ask you.

862
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,501
- Ok. Go ahead.

863
00:51:53,675 --> 00:52:02,031
- Why are you running
from your home and your family?

864
00:52:02,206 --> 00:52:04,643
- You read my journal.

865
00:52:04,817 --> 00:52:07,036
- I know it was wrong, but...

866
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:09,343
It was so well-written, and...

867
00:52:09,517 --> 00:52:12,651
I wanted to know
what inspired the stories.

868
00:52:12,825 --> 00:52:15,306
- That's my business.

869
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:18,439
- Gabe, it isn't hard to see
that Jack is you.

870
00:52:18,613 --> 00:52:19,832
Whenever I ask you
about your past,

871
00:52:20,006 --> 00:52:22,835
you change the subject.

872
00:52:23,009 --> 00:52:25,054
It's...
It's as if you're trying to...

873
00:52:25,229 --> 00:52:27,100
- Hide something.

874
00:52:27,274 --> 00:52:28,406
- Oh, we all have things
in our past

875
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:30,582
that we aren't proud of.

876
00:52:30,756 --> 00:52:43,421
I wasn't meant to be here
either.

877
00:52:43,595 --> 00:52:46,859
I ran away from home
when I was 18.

878
00:52:47,033 --> 00:52:49,514
I joined up with
a traveling theater group.

879
00:52:49,688 --> 00:52:50,906
We'd move from town to town
every few days,

880
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:54,345
and at first, it was exciting.

881
00:52:54,519 --> 00:52:57,086
And then, being on the road
and the men I ran into,

882
00:52:57,261 --> 00:52:59,611
I wished I'd never left home.

883
00:52:59,785 --> 00:53:02,527
But I didn't want to go
back there, either.

884
00:53:02,701 --> 00:53:05,094
One day, we came
to deer Springs, and I...

885
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:07,532
I met my husband
during the intermission.

886
00:53:07,706 --> 00:53:10,491
He was the only man
that ever really listened to me.

887
00:53:10,665 --> 00:53:12,189
All I know is,

888
00:53:12,363 --> 00:53:14,539
we went out for dinner
after the show, and...

889
00:53:14,713 --> 00:53:17,759
I decided then that
I wasn't going back on the road,

890
00:53:17,933 --> 00:53:18,891
that I would...

891
00:53:19,065 --> 00:53:20,675
Stay here

892
00:53:20,849 --> 00:53:23,504
and do whatever it took

893
00:53:23,678 --> 00:53:27,552
to make my own home, my family.

894
00:53:27,726 --> 00:53:30,163
I have two children
I love with all my heart,

895
00:53:30,337 --> 00:53:32,861
but it is hard
to keep hoping for the best

896
00:53:33,035 --> 00:53:34,994
when all we've seen is things go
from bad to worse.

897
00:53:35,168 --> 00:53:36,952
[Sighs]

898
00:53:37,126 --> 00:53:38,389
This certainly isn't the life

899
00:53:38,563 --> 00:53:43,132
I would have imagined
for myself.

900
00:53:43,307 --> 00:53:45,178
And you?

901
00:53:45,352 --> 00:53:50,052
- I think you already know
enough about my life.

902
00:54:18,994 --> 00:54:21,562
- You and Gabe didn't say a word
between you at breakfast.

903
00:54:23,738 --> 00:54:25,697
- Told him I read his journal.

904
00:54:25,871 --> 00:54:28,526
I ended up telling him
just about everything.

905
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,571
- And he didn't do the same.

906
00:54:30,745 --> 00:54:33,095
You can't expect a man
to just open up

907
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,620
and spill his guts to you.

908
00:54:35,794 --> 00:54:37,622
Got to talk to a man,

909
00:54:37,796 --> 00:54:40,799
make him feel comfortable
about opening up to ya.

910
00:54:40,973 --> 00:54:44,237
That's a big leap for any man
to show his true feelings.

911
00:54:44,411 --> 00:54:47,196
And I think that
whatever's troubling Gabe

912
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:50,417
is making it especially hard
for him.

913
00:54:50,591 --> 00:54:53,159
- Hey, Becky, grab the...
- I got it.

914
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:54,813
I got this one.

915
00:54:54,987 --> 00:54:56,858
Keep it up, now.

916
00:54:57,032 --> 00:55:02,168
That's right.
You're doing great.

917
00:55:02,342 --> 00:55:04,518
All right, gentlemen.
Time to stretch it out.

918
00:55:08,957 --> 00:55:10,132
- They usually don't take
to strangers

919
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,743
like they've taken to you.

920
00:55:11,917 --> 00:55:15,050
- Yeah, well, we've been
bunkmates for a while,

921
00:55:15,224 --> 00:55:18,184
not for a short time.

922
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:21,622
- You know, animals have
a special way of knowing

923
00:55:21,796 --> 00:55:23,624
who to trust and who not to,

924
00:55:23,798 --> 00:55:25,496
especially old boys
like these two.

925
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:28,237
- [Laughing]
- Ain't that right, guys?

926
00:55:28,412 --> 00:55:30,805
- Well, most wouldn't expect
a horse to be

927
00:55:30,979 --> 00:55:34,592
much better judge of people
than you or I.

928
00:55:34,766 --> 00:55:36,202
- Well...

929
00:55:36,376 --> 00:55:38,770
Then I'm a pretty good judge
of people, Gabe.

930
00:55:38,944 --> 00:55:41,773
And I think you're a...
Sensitive soul

931
00:55:41,947 --> 00:55:44,210
with a lot of potential.

932
00:55:44,384 --> 00:55:46,343
You know, Eliza thinks so, too,

933
00:55:46,517 --> 00:55:48,867
or she wouldn't have come to you
the way she did before.

934
00:55:49,041 --> 00:55:52,174
- Yeah, well,
don't get me wrong.

935
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,699
I like it here very much,

936
00:55:54,873 --> 00:55:57,658
and all of you have become
very dear to me in a short time,

937
00:55:57,832 --> 00:55:59,617
but I don't want there to be
any misunderstanding

938
00:55:59,791 --> 00:56:01,662
about who or what I am.

939
00:56:01,836 --> 00:56:04,448
- Well, that's pretty hard
to avoid

940
00:56:04,622 --> 00:56:07,886
if you're not willing
to open your heart to us.

941
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:09,104
Yeah, well...

942
00:56:09,278 --> 00:56:10,628
I just don't see any good

943
00:56:10,802 --> 00:56:12,281
in bringing others
into my troubles,

944
00:56:12,456 --> 00:56:14,066
for me or them.

945
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,069
- Nobody's asking you
to lay yourself out there

946
00:56:17,243 --> 00:56:19,071
for the buzzards, Gabe.

947
00:56:19,245 --> 00:56:22,074
Just... just talk to her.

948
00:56:22,248 --> 00:56:25,817
Make her feel that
you understand and appreciate

949
00:56:25,991 --> 00:56:29,560
the way she opened up to you
before.

950
00:56:29,734 --> 00:56:32,737
What you decide to tell her and
how long it takes you to say it

951
00:56:32,911 --> 00:56:33,607
is up to you.

952
00:56:35,174 --> 00:56:37,350
- All right.

953
00:56:37,524 --> 00:56:40,179
Thanks, Batty.
I'll give it some thought.

954
00:56:40,353 --> 00:56:50,232
- You do that.

955
00:56:50,407 --> 00:57:10,122
- You do that.

956
00:57:10,296 --> 00:57:11,776
I think I'll, uh... go in

957
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:14,431
and listen to the radio
with the children.

958
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,670
- Excuse me.

959
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:42,807
- I want you to know
I'm truly sorry for what I did.

960
00:57:42,981 --> 00:57:45,766
I just want to know you better.

961
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:47,812
Know who you are inside.

962
00:57:47,986 --> 00:57:50,641
- Eliza, have I...

963
00:57:50,815 --> 00:57:52,817
Have I given you any reason
to doubt me

964
00:57:52,991 --> 00:57:54,340
and my intentions?

965
00:57:54,514 --> 00:57:57,735
- No.

966
00:57:57,909 --> 00:57:59,867
You've been a godsend to us all.

967
00:58:00,041 --> 00:58:02,783
I don't know what I would be
doing right now without you.

968
00:58:02,957 --> 00:58:04,306
- I want you to know
I really appreciate you coming

969
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,178
and talking to me before.

970
00:58:06,352 --> 00:58:07,788
- [Radio] We interrupt this
program for a special...

971
00:58:07,962 --> 00:58:09,007
- I really do.

972
00:58:09,181 --> 00:58:10,530
- Mom, Gabe, come quick!

973
00:58:10,704 --> 00:58:12,663
- The weather bureau
has informed me

974
00:58:12,837 --> 00:58:15,361
that the tri-county area can
expect a high-pressure system...

975
00:58:15,535 --> 00:58:16,536
- Shh...

976
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:19,234
- To move into the area tonight,

977
00:58:19,408 --> 00:58:22,803
bringing temperatures
at or below freezing.

978
00:58:22,977 --> 00:58:24,805
All farmers should take
whatever steps they can

979
00:58:24,979 --> 00:58:28,766
to protect their crops
or orchards.

980
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,463
- Well, we don't have much time.

981
00:58:30,637 --> 00:58:39,864
There are smudge pots and oil
in the barn.

982
00:58:40,038 --> 00:58:41,692
- Get the bottom of this.
- Up you go.

983
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:46,000
- Coming up around
the other side.

984
00:58:46,174 --> 00:58:47,828
[Horse whinnies]

985
00:58:58,491 --> 00:59:00,058
- Ugh! It's heavy!

986
00:59:00,232 --> 00:59:01,538
- Here, put it here.

987
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:05,716
- Right down in the middle.

988
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:07,065
I don't want anything
going wrong.

989
00:59:10,024 --> 00:59:12,113
- All right.

990
00:59:12,287 --> 00:59:14,159
You think that's gonna stay?
- Yep.

991
00:59:20,644 --> 00:59:22,080
- I hope the oil holds out.

992
00:59:22,254 --> 00:59:24,473
- "The barrel of meal
shall not waste,

993
00:59:24,648 --> 00:59:27,259

Ist kings,chapter 17.

995
00:59:33,047 --> 00:59:35,180
- Make sure you put it on tight.

996
00:59:43,188 --> 00:59:44,581
Yeah, ok. Watch your feet.

997
00:59:47,409 --> 00:59:50,064
- Giddy up! [Kiss noises]

998
00:59:50,238 --> 00:59:51,718
[Horse whinnying]

999
01:00:05,079 --> 01:00:06,907
- [Sighs]

1000
01:00:07,081 --> 01:00:08,822
Well...

1001
01:00:08,996 --> 01:00:10,824
All we can do now
is wait 'til the morning.

1002
01:00:13,566 --> 01:00:16,787
- Batty talks about faith
like it grows on trees.

1003
01:00:18,049 --> 01:00:19,485
[Sigh] It's so hard to believe

1004
01:00:19,659 --> 01:00:22,053
that there's anyone
looking out for us.

1005
01:00:22,227 --> 01:00:25,622
We've just gone
from one bad turn to the next.

1006
01:00:25,796 --> 01:00:27,972
- You haven't lost
all your faith, have you?

1007
01:00:31,105 --> 01:00:32,454
- I didn't say that.

1008
01:00:38,243 --> 01:00:39,810
- Eliza, we've done all we can.

1009
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:43,988
Let's have faith in that.

1010
01:00:44,162 --> 01:00:44,858
Let go.

1011
01:01:23,418 --> 01:01:24,855
- [Sighing]

1012
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:37,824
Whew.

1013

[Slurping]

01:01:49,444 --> 01:01:51,185
[Laughing]
- [Exclaiming] Oh!

1015
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:52,970
- Yes! Yes!

1016
01:01:53,144 --> 01:01:57,714
All: [Cheering and laughing]

1017
01:02:01,326 --> 01:02:02,806
- Ahh.

1018
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:05,460
This fresh air makes me feel
young again.

1019
01:02:05,634 --> 01:02:07,636
- Last night was a miracle.

1020
01:02:07,811 --> 01:02:11,031
- Yeah. Let's hope
we don't get another frost.

1021
01:02:12,554 --> 01:02:14,121
- Whoo.

1022
01:02:14,295 --> 01:02:15,644
I think it's about time
I call the wholesalers

1023
01:02:15,819 --> 01:02:17,037
that usually bid on the crop,

1024
01:02:17,211 --> 01:02:18,735
get 'em out here
to make an offer.

1025
01:02:18,909 --> 01:02:20,432
We're running out of time
before the note's due.

1026
01:02:20,606 --> 01:02:21,999
- We got enough in?

1027
01:02:22,173 --> 01:02:23,217
- Well, we've got to do
something.

1028
01:02:23,391 --> 01:02:25,045
It's our best shot.

1029
01:02:25,219 --> 01:02:26,612
- Well, Mrs. Wyatt,

1030
01:02:26,786 --> 01:02:27,569
it's a little early
to come out there.

1031
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,484
- I understand.

1032
01:02:29,658 --> 01:02:32,052
- Well, maybe I can arrange
a trip in about four days.

1033
01:02:32,226 --> 01:02:33,793
- Four days.

1034
01:02:33,967 --> 01:02:35,447
- Crops got to be in the boxes,
not on the trees.

1035
01:02:35,621 --> 01:02:38,102
- I understand, sir.
We'll... we'll be ready.

1036
01:02:38,276 --> 01:02:40,626
- All right, I'll see you
in four days, Mrs. Wyatt.

1037
01:02:45,413 --> 01:02:47,154
- There is no way
we'll be ready.

1038
01:02:52,246 --> 01:02:53,770
- So?

1039
01:02:53,944 --> 01:02:56,685
- Well, I was only able to reach
one wholesaler.

1040
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:59,471
He's gonna be around here
in about four days.

1041
01:02:59,645 --> 01:03:01,038
He'll see how big an order
he can take.

1042
01:03:01,212 --> 01:03:02,517
- Four days.

1043
01:03:02,691 --> 01:03:04,432
We've got a lot more work
ahead of us.

1044
01:03:04,606 --> 01:03:05,782
- Here comes the sheriff.

1045
01:03:18,142 --> 01:03:20,797
- I see the crop seems
to have weathered the frost.

1046
01:03:20,971 --> 01:03:25,062
- Eliza, I was talking
to Preston earlier today.

1047
01:03:25,236 --> 01:03:27,499
He put me on the phone
with a gentleman

1048
01:03:27,673 --> 01:03:29,109
by the name of Kornhaus.

1049
01:03:29,283 --> 01:03:31,503
Works for the bank
in San Francisco.

1050
01:03:31,677 --> 01:03:34,158
Said they'd be out to see you
the day after tomorrow.

1051
01:03:34,332 --> 01:03:37,161
- Well, I can't get a wholesaler
out here by then.

1052
01:03:43,689 --> 01:03:45,691
- What?
A few extra hands couldn't hurt.

1053
01:03:45,865 --> 01:03:47,432
- [Laughing]

1054
01:03:47,606 --> 01:03:49,173
Well, all right.

1055
01:03:49,347 --> 01:03:50,130
Let's go to work.

1056
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:52,959
- [Laughing]

1057
01:03:54,656 --> 01:03:57,137
- I don't want there to be
any more secrets between us.

1058
01:03:57,311 --> 01:04:01,489
I was so desperate
to make my father proud of me,

1059
01:04:01,663 --> 01:04:05,580
that when the war came along,

1060
01:04:05,754 --> 01:04:07,365
I decided to sign up.

1061
01:04:08,279 --> 01:04:09,846
And, uh...

1062
01:04:12,544 --> 01:04:16,591
That's my older brother.
He wouldn't let me go alone.

1063
01:04:16,765 --> 01:04:19,768
So, uh... he signed up, too.

1064
01:04:19,943 --> 01:04:21,727
A few years later,

1065
01:04:21,901 --> 01:04:23,772
I was on a boat coming home,

1066
01:04:23,947 --> 01:04:27,646
and he was in a grave in France.

1067
01:04:30,431 --> 01:04:32,956
- I'm sorry.

1068
01:04:33,130 --> 01:04:35,393
- I know my family
never forgave me

1069
01:04:35,567 --> 01:04:37,134
for my brother's death.

1070
01:04:37,308 --> 01:04:39,223
They kept quiet about it.

1071
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:44,184
And that silence is...

1072
01:04:44,358 --> 01:04:47,405
What ate away not only at me,
but all of us.

1073
01:04:49,668 --> 01:04:53,150
After that...

1074
01:04:53,324 --> 01:04:55,979
My house, my family...

1075
01:04:56,153 --> 01:04:59,634
All of it seemed like anything
but my own.

1076
01:05:03,421 --> 01:05:06,250
I couldn't stand
the looks on their faces.

1077
01:05:07,816 --> 01:05:10,689
The coldness in their hearts.

1078
01:05:14,388 --> 01:05:16,129
- I've seen in your heart.

1079
01:05:17,783 --> 01:05:20,438
You're a good soul.

1080
01:05:20,612 --> 01:05:26,357
You need to hold onto that,
not some bad memories or...

1081
01:05:26,531 --> 01:05:29,229
Feelings that others
have forced on you.

1082
01:05:29,403 --> 01:05:31,753
- I want to make new memories.

1083
01:05:34,539 --> 01:05:36,062
Good ones.

1084
01:05:37,411 --> 01:05:38,543
With you.

1085
01:06:17,625 --> 01:06:20,193

â™ª

1087
01:06:25,459 --> 01:06:27,157
- Strange weather
we've been having.

1088
01:06:27,331 --> 01:06:30,073
Right near froze to death
the other night.

1089
01:06:30,247 --> 01:06:33,641
Then it's hot as blazes
in the daytime.

1090
01:06:33,815 --> 01:06:36,862
Uh-oh, here comes trouble.

1091
01:06:38,472 --> 01:06:40,213
- Gentlemen.
[Horse whinnies]

1092
01:06:40,387 --> 01:06:43,608
This is Mr. Kornhaus
of the first allied trust,

1093
01:06:43,782 --> 01:06:45,175
San Francisco.

1094
01:06:45,349 --> 01:06:47,177
- How do you do, sir?
- We've spoken.

1095
01:06:47,351 --> 01:06:51,485
- Sheriff, I wonder
if you'd escort Mr. Kornhaus

1096
01:06:51,659 --> 01:06:53,574
and myself for a few days.

1097
01:06:53,748 --> 01:06:57,317
We, unfortunately, have
some rather unpleasant business

1098
01:06:57,491 --> 01:06:59,885
to discuss with a few members
of our community,

1099
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:02,366
and Mr. Kornhaus feels the need

1100
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:05,456
of an objective
representative of the law

1101
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:07,066
to come along with us.

1102
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:08,589
- Most people are resigned
to their fate,

1103
01:07:08,763 --> 01:07:11,288
but a few just refuse
to cooperate.

1104
01:07:11,462 --> 01:07:13,464
- All right, I'll go with you.

1105
01:07:13,638 --> 01:07:15,683
But I want to make one thing
clear.

1106
01:07:15,857 --> 01:07:18,599
I'm going to enforce
the letter of the law.

1107
01:07:18,773 --> 01:07:20,340
I'm not going to be
a debt collector

1108
01:07:20,514 --> 01:07:22,473
for your fancy
San Francisco bank,

1109
01:07:22,647 --> 01:07:23,909
Mr. Kornhaus.

1110
01:07:24,083 --> 01:07:26,607
You understand that,
we'll get along.

1111
01:07:43,581 --> 01:07:46,497
- Mrs. Wyatt, I was wondering
if we could have a word.

1112
01:07:48,629 --> 01:07:51,589
- Come with me.

1113
01:07:58,248 --> 01:08:00,554
- This is Mr. Kornhaus
of the first allied trust,

1114
01:08:00,728 --> 01:08:01,860
in San Francisco.

1115
01:08:02,034 --> 01:08:02,904
- Mr. Kornhaus.

1116
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,732
- Madame.

1117
01:08:04,906 --> 01:08:07,866
- This is my property manager,
Mr. Gabriel Harper.

1118
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,737
- Sir.
- Mr. Harper.

1119
01:08:09,911 --> 01:08:11,348
- Eliza, we all know

1120
01:08:11,522 --> 01:08:13,741
that you have a payment due
on the mortgage.

1121
01:08:13,915 --> 01:08:15,874
Now, I told you that,

1122
01:08:16,048 --> 01:08:19,747
because of certain
emergency funding requirements,

1123
01:08:19,921 --> 01:08:25,623
that Mr. Kornhaus' bank is
requesting a call on your loan.

1124
01:08:25,797 --> 01:08:29,714
I also said that I would try and
find a buyer for your property.

1125
01:08:33,761 --> 01:08:36,416
Someone who would make you
an offer

1126
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:38,462
that would pay off
all of your debts

1127
01:08:38,636 --> 01:08:42,422
and leave you with enough
to get set elsewhere.

1128
01:08:42,596 --> 01:08:44,207
- It's a fair offer.

1129
01:08:44,381 --> 01:08:47,210
From unified farms,
out of San Antonio, Texas.

1130
01:08:47,384 --> 01:08:49,473
- They're helping
a lot of people in the region

1131
01:08:49,647 --> 01:08:52,432
who are in the same bind
as you are.

1132
01:08:52,606 --> 01:08:55,392
- They're only trying
to help everybody out.

1133
01:08:55,566 --> 01:08:56,741
- It isn't much.

1134
01:08:56,915 --> 01:08:58,786
- It's fair.

1135
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,397
And your only offer.

1136
01:09:00,571 --> 01:09:03,530
- Eliza, if you don't sell
the property,

1137
01:09:03,704 --> 01:09:08,492
Mr. Kornhaus' bank intends
to foreclose in 48 hours.

1138
01:09:08,666 --> 01:09:10,798
- That is, unless you can make
a full payment

1139
01:09:10,972 --> 01:09:12,800
of the money owed the bank
before then.

1140
01:09:12,974 --> 01:09:15,890
- I have a wholesaler coming
to make an offer on my harvest

1141
01:09:16,064 --> 01:09:17,501
the morning after next,

1142
01:09:17,675 --> 01:09:20,547
so I'm going to have to refuse
the offer.

1143
01:09:23,028 --> 01:09:26,074
- Mrs. Wyatt, you should know
this offer has been made

1144
01:09:26,249 --> 01:09:28,860
in a generous
and benevolent fashion.

1145
01:09:29,034 --> 01:09:30,992
- I appreciate the offer,
but thank you.

1146
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,994
We'll be just fine.

- Where's Gabe?

1152
01:11:18,796 --> 01:11:20,580
- He's gone out for a bit.

1153
01:11:20,754 --> 01:11:21,973
- Where did he go?

1154
01:11:22,147 --> 01:11:24,192
- I don't know.

1155
01:11:24,367 --> 01:11:26,543
- When will he be coming back?

1156
01:11:26,717 --> 01:11:28,196
- Let's not worry about Gabe.

1157
01:11:28,371 --> 01:11:30,851
We've got a long day
ahead of us.

1158

[Car door closes]
Oh, good.

Help's arrived.

are here.

Kids, come and take them
their breakfast.

1162
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:01,839
We'll be out shortly.

[All talking]

1164
01:12:07,018 --> 01:12:08,628
- I knew this would happen.

1165
01:12:08,802 --> 01:12:10,587
How am I going to tell
those kids that he's gone

1166
01:12:10,761 --> 01:12:11,805
and he's not coming back?

1167
01:12:11,979 --> 01:12:14,939
- Let's not jump to conclusions.

1168
01:12:15,113 --> 01:12:17,202
- Conclusions? He's not here.
What am I supposed to think?

1169
01:12:17,376 --> 01:12:19,552
- I know he just wouldn't
up and leave, Eliza.

1170
01:12:19,726 --> 01:12:21,641
He really cared about you
and those children.

1171

It was plain as day.

01:12:24,775 --> 01:12:27,125

01:14:01,306 --> 01:14:03,047
I didn't want to let you down.

1185
01:14:05,092 --> 01:14:07,181
I was just hoping we could keep
this place going a little longer

1186
01:14:07,355 --> 01:14:09,183

1187

Now what am I gonna do?

1188

The man from the bank
comes tomorrow,

1189
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:29,813
so we need to be ready.

1190
01:14:31,945 --> 01:14:34,382
I think we should, uh,
pack everything we can

1191
01:14:34,557 --> 01:14:35,949
and put it in the wagon.

1192
01:14:36,123 --> 01:14:39,170
- I don't want to leave
our home, ma.

1193
01:14:39,344 --> 01:14:42,347
- We'll go up and pack together.

1194
01:14:42,521 --> 01:14:44,305
- I don't even have a suitcase.

1195
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,090
- Well...

1196
01:14:46,264 --> 01:14:48,135
You can share mine.

1197
01:14:50,311 --> 01:14:52,792
- Batty, would you mind
calling the walkers,

1198
01:14:52,966 --> 01:14:54,620
telling them
not to come tomorrow?

1199
01:15:31,352 --> 01:15:32,745
Penny for your thoughts.

1200
01:15:34,442 --> 01:15:36,706
- They're not even worth
a penny.

1201
01:15:40,231 --> 01:15:41,754
- You miss Gabe, don't you?

1202
01:15:45,584 --> 01:15:46,846
Me too.

1203
01:15:50,371 --> 01:15:52,504
- Didn't even say goodbye.

1204
01:15:54,985 --> 01:15:57,857
- Well...

1205
01:15:58,031 --> 01:16:00,817
It's easier that way
for some people.

1206
01:16:00,991 --> 01:16:03,341
Goodbyes are hard.

1207
01:16:03,515 --> 01:16:05,996

1208
01:16:12,089 --> 01:16:14,570
Ma, I'm scared to leave.

1209
01:16:18,617 --> 01:16:20,576

Just as long as we're together,

01:18:06,203 --> 01:18:08,335
What are you doing here?

1227
01:18:08,509 --> 01:18:09,510
What do you want?

1228
01:18:27,615 --> 01:18:29,008
- Thought we could use
some help

1229
01:18:29,182 --> 01:18:30,967
if we want to bring the crop in
on time.

1230
01:18:31,141 --> 01:18:33,578
- Gabe!

1231
01:18:39,497 --> 01:18:41,194
I thought you'd left.

1232
01:18:41,368 --> 01:18:44,284
- I've run from enough things
in my life.

1233
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:47,723
If I can't make a stand here
for people I care about...

1234
01:18:49,289 --> 01:18:50,726
I might as well wander
the rest of my life.

1235
01:18:53,641 --> 01:18:55,382
- Gabe!
- [Laughing]

1236
01:18:55,556 --> 01:18:57,210
Hey, guys.

1237
01:18:57,384 --> 01:18:59,125
All right.

1238
01:18:59,299 --> 01:19:00,431
How you been?

1239
01:19:00,605 --> 01:19:02,346
- Gabe.

1240
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:05,044
- Batty.
- Oh, Gabe. Ohh!

1241
01:19:05,218 --> 01:19:07,525
- I brought some friends along.

1242
01:19:07,699 --> 01:19:09,701
- You boys hungry?
All: Yes!

1243
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:12,008
- I'll fix you
the best breakfast you ever had.

1244
01:19:12,182 --> 01:19:14,053
Orange picking's tough work.

1245
01:19:14,227 --> 01:19:16,012
You need your strength.

1246
01:19:16,186 --> 01:19:17,274
Go to the barn.
I'll bring it in there.

1247
01:19:17,448 --> 01:19:18,275
Come on, kids.

1248
01:19:18,449 --> 01:19:21,408
[Men talking]

1249
01:19:23,410 --> 01:19:25,151
- How did you find
all these men?

1250
01:19:25,325 --> 01:19:27,066
- Well, you ride the rails
as long as I have,

1251
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:28,502
you know where to look.

1252
01:19:47,652 --> 01:19:50,916
[Engine starting]

1253
01:19:57,618 --> 01:20:00,447

â™ª

1255
01:20:18,683 --> 01:20:19,684
- Come on.

1256
01:20:42,576 --> 01:20:44,230
- Afraid so.

1257
01:20:58,592 --> 01:21:00,594
- Mrs. Wyatt.

1258
01:21:00,768 --> 01:21:03,293
We're here to officially
serve you with notice

1259
01:21:03,467 --> 01:21:05,643
of foreclosure.

1260
01:21:05,817 --> 01:21:07,863
- Wait, hold on, sheriff.

1261
01:21:08,037 --> 01:21:12,171
Mr. Kornhaus,
this is Mr. Jennings,

1262
01:21:12,345 --> 01:21:14,086
from Gilbert wholesalers.

1263
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:16,349
- Mr. Jennings was just telling
myself and Mr. Harper

1264
01:21:16,523 --> 01:21:19,309
that he's willing to cut a check
for the entire crop,

1265
01:21:19,483 --> 01:21:21,267
minus rejects and runts.

1266
01:21:21,441 --> 01:21:23,617
- But I'd be more than happy
to draft that check to you, sir.

1267
01:21:23,791 --> 01:21:25,881
- It will be enough
to cover our debt.

1268
01:21:40,330 --> 01:21:42,071
- How in the world
did you do it?

1269
01:21:42,245 --> 01:21:43,724
- I just gathered up
some hard-working men

1270
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:45,552
that wanted a fair shake,

1271
01:21:45,726 --> 01:21:48,468
like the one I got.
- Whoo.

1272
01:21:48,642 --> 01:21:50,209
- Mr. Jennings liked the looks
of what he saw in the barn

1273
01:21:50,383 --> 01:21:52,777
and even more
of what's in the fields.

1274
01:21:52,951 --> 01:21:57,825
- Well, it's good when
your faith in somebody pays off.

1275
01:21:58,391 --> 01:22:00,437
- Sheriff.

1276
01:22:00,611 --> 01:22:01,960
- Thank you, Mr. Jennings.

1277
01:22:02,134 --> 01:22:04,441
- Don't thank me,
just get that crop in.

1278
01:22:04,615 --> 01:22:06,878
- It's been a pleasure.
- Sure. Same here.

1279
01:22:07,052 --> 01:22:10,229
I look forward
to seeing you folks next year.

1280
01:22:10,403 --> 01:22:14,146
Good luck to you.

1281

[Vehicle driving away]

1283
01:22:29,466 --> 01:22:33,383
- Eliza, wilt thou have this man
to thy wedded husband,

1284
01:22:33,557 --> 01:22:36,647
to live together
after god's ordinance?

1285
01:22:36,821 --> 01:22:39,345
Wilt thou love him,

1286
01:22:39,519 --> 01:22:43,610
comfort him, honor and keep him
in sickness and in health,

1287
01:22:43,784 --> 01:22:45,612
as long as you both shall live?

1288
01:22:45,786 --> 01:22:49,268
- I will.
- Repeat after me.

1289
01:22:49,442 --> 01:22:52,315
"With this ring, I thee wed."

1290
01:22:52,489 --> 01:22:53,925
- With this ring, I thee wed.

1291
01:22:54,099 --> 01:22:55,840
- "With my body,
I thee worship."

1292
01:22:56,014 --> 01:22:58,538
- With my body, I thee worship.

1293
01:22:58,712 --> 01:22:59,844
- "And with
all my worldly goods,

1294
01:23:00,018 --> 01:23:01,498
I thee endow."

1295
01:23:01,672 --> 01:23:04,457
- And with all my worldly goods,
I thee endow.

1296
01:23:04,631 --> 01:23:06,242
- "Amen."

1297
01:23:06,416 --> 01:23:09,680
- Amen.

1298
01:23:09,854 --> 01:23:13,336
- I now pronounce you
man and wife.

1299
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:18,384
You may kiss the bride.

1300
01:23:18,558 --> 01:23:28,525
[Applause]
