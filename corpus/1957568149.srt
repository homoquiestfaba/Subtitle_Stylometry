00:01:02,171 --> 00:01:05,000
...SO, UM, THERE MIGHT BE
A FEW BARNACLES ON IT

4
00:01:05,043 --> 00:01:06,784
BUT I'VE BEEN ASSURED
BY SOME OF YOU

5
00:01:06,828 --> 00:01:09,395
THAT HAVE HAD MORE RECENT
SAILING EXPERIENCE THAN I HAVE

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,659
THAT IN JUST A MATTER
OF A FEW HOURS

00:01:11,702 --> 00:01:14,313
OUT ON THE
STRAITS OF JUAN DE FUCA

8
00:01:14,357 --> 00:01:17,142
AND ALL THOSE BARNACLES
WILL SLOUGH OFF

9
00:01:17,186 --> 00:01:20,058
AND IT'LL BE SMOOTH SAILING
FROM THERE ON OUT

10
00:01:20,102 --> 00:01:23,235
ACROSS THE PACIFIC TO
THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS.

11
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:28,501
AND AFTER SOME RECUPERATIVE TIME
ON OAHU, MAYBE ON TO KAUAI,

12
00:01:28,545 --> 00:01:31,156
AND THEN I'LL SET MY SIGHTS
TO MOVE A LITTLE FURTHER WEST

13
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,941
AND I'M NOT SURE
WHETHER IT'S GONNA BE JAPAN

14
00:01:32,984 --> 00:01:36,118
OR THE PHILIPPINES.

15
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:37,946
MAYBE I'LL WANT TO UH,

16
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:41,210
MAYBE I'LL WANT TO
SAIL AROUND THE WORLD!

18
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:47,520
AND I CAN ASSURE YOU,

19
00:01:47,564 --> 00:01:50,393
TAKING SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS
IN INSPECTING MY BOAT

20
00:01:50,436 --> 00:01:52,090
AND PROVISIONING MY BOAT.

21
00:01:52,134 --> 00:01:55,616
I'VE STOCKED
THE BOAT THOROUGHLY.

22
00:01:55,659 --> 00:02:00,098
THE FACT IS, I HAVE 480,000
CALORIES OF FOODSTUFF ON BOARD.

23
00:02:00,142 --> 00:02:01,970
I'VE CALCULATED
THAT WOULD LAST ME

24
00:02:02,013 --> 00:02:05,321
SOMETHING ON THE ORDER
OF ALMOST TWO MONTHS.

25
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:11,153
I'VE HAD AT LEAST HALF A DOZEN
PRACTICE SESSIONS HERE

26
00:02:11,196 --> 00:02:13,155
JUST RECENTLY OUT
IN THE BAY.

27
00:02:13,198 --> 00:02:16,288
AND I PRACTICE THINGS
LIKE SCANNING THE HORIZON

28
00:02:16,332 --> 00:02:17,855
AND THE FOREGROUND
LOOKING FOR DEBRIS

29
00:02:17,899 --> 00:02:20,510
THAT I DON'T WANT TO RUN OVER.

30
00:02:20,553 --> 00:02:23,034
AND ALSO, I'VE GOT A HANDBOOK.

31
00:02:23,078 --> 00:02:24,688
I BOUGHT A HANDBOOK.

32
00:02:24,732 --> 00:02:27,343
IT'S ALL ABOUT LIVING AT SEA
IN A RAFT.

33
00:02:27,386 --> 00:02:29,867
HOW TO SURVIVE IN AN EMERGENCY.

34
00:02:29,911 --> 00:02:34,611
I'VE EVEN GOT A GPS TO HELP ME
WITH MY CELESTIAL NAVIGATION.

35
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:37,570
I'VE BEEN REALLY HONING
MY SKILLS AS A SAILOR

36
00:02:37,614 --> 00:02:39,181
AND THEY ARE JUST
A LITTLE BIT RUSTY

37
00:02:39,224 --> 00:02:43,576
BUT I'VE BEEN REAL PLEASED
WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING.

38
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,969
KEEP IN MIND,

39
00:02:45,013 --> 00:02:48,973
I HAVE LIVED ON THIS BOAT
FOR NEARLY 30 YEARS NOW

40
00:02:49,017 --> 00:02:51,497
AND WHEN YOU'RE CONFINED
TO 70 SQUARE FEET OVER 30 YEARS,

41
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,108
YOU REALLY GET TO KNOW

42
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:56,720
ALL THE LITTLE
NOOKS AND CRANNIES

43
00:02:56,764 --> 00:03:00,071

ALMOST A PART OF YOU.

00:03:00,115 --> 00:03:02,726
YOU KNOW, I KNOW WE ALL
HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT BRITT BUT,

45
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,772
BY GOLLY, WE OUGHT TO BE
REALLY HAPPY FOR HIM.

46
00:03:04,815 --> 00:03:07,731

QUALITY AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE

00:03:07,775 --> 00:03:09,690
ALL OF HIS LIFE THAT I KNOWN.

48
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:11,561
HELL, I'VE KNOWN HIM
FOR LONGER THAN YOU HAVE.

49
00:03:11,604 --> 00:03:14,042
PROBABLY 30-40 YEARS
THAT I'VE KNOWN HIM.

50
00:03:14,085 --> 00:03:16,131
YOU KNOW, THIS IS A GUY
THAT'S NEVER BEEN ANYWHERE.

51
00:03:16,174 --> 00:03:17,741
HE'S NEVER BEEN NORTH TO CANADA.

52
00:03:17,785 --> 00:03:19,264
HE'S NEVER BEEN TO MONTANA.

53
00:03:19,308 --> 00:03:22,006
I DON'T THINK HE'S EVEN
BEEN SOUTH TO OREGON.

54
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,312
AND HERE HE'S UNDERGOING
THIS GREAT ADVENTURE.

55
00:03:23,355 --> 00:03:24,617
WE KNOW THE BOAT IS OLD

56
00:03:24,661 --> 00:03:27,490
AND, YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT VERY WELL EQUIPPED

57
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:29,144
BUT HE SEEMS TO BE ABLE
TO DEAL WITH THAT.

58
00:03:29,187 --> 00:03:31,668

I'M SO HAPPY FOR HIM I JUST...

SIT RIGHT WITH ME EITHER

CALL ME THESE DAYS.

FOR A RIDE HOME ONE DAY

WITH SOME STORY
ABOUT A FENDER-BENDER

00:04:14,929 --> 00:04:17,061
BUT IT DID GET ME OUT OF THE
HOUSE AND THE THING WAS,

75
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:18,759
I SORT OF ENJOYED HIS COMPANY.

76
00:04:18,802 --> 00:04:20,673
HE TURNED OUT TO BE
A FASCINATING GUY

PRETTY FOND OF HIM.

LIKE A SACK OF SHIT.

121
00:06:23,274 --> 00:06:25,102
AND USUALLY THOSE
GET TRANSFORMED

122
00:06:25,146 --> 00:06:27,583
INTO ARGUMENTS OF SOME KIND.

IT WAS PRETTY INCREDIBLE

00:52:13,195 --> 00:52:16,024
HE'S A VERY NICE MAN
AND I ENJOYED MEETING HIM.

1190
00:52:16,068 --> 00:52:22,248
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MORE TIME
TO TALK WITH YOU.

1191
00:52:22,291 --> 00:52:26,469
UHHH.
UH, WELL.

1192
00:52:26,513 --> 00:52:29,559
MAYBE, MAYBE TOMORROW
WE CAN GET TOGETHER.

1193
00:52:29,603 --> 00:52:30,952
THAT'D BE GREAT.

1194
00:52:30,996 --> 00:52:36,044
I'D LOVE TO SEE YOUR HOUSE
OR IS THAT YOUR BOAT?

1195
00:52:36,088 --> 00:52:38,264
WELL, I, I HAVE A BOAT.

1196
00:52:38,307 --> 00:52:40,745
I LIVE ON THE BOAT.
IT'S NOT REALLY A HOUSE.

1197
00:52:40,788 --> 00:52:47,969
IT'S...YOU MIGHT SAY THAT'S
WHERE I, WHERE I RESIDE.

1198
00:52:48,013 --> 00:52:52,539
UH, I'LL BE HAPPY
TO SHOW YOU MY BOAT.

1199
00:52:52,582 --> 00:52:54,149
GEE, THAT'D BE WONDERFUL.

1200
00:52:54,193 --> 00:52:56,978
THANKS SO MUCH.
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

1201
00:52:57,022 --> 00:52:59,024
OKAY. OKAY.

1202
00:52:59,067 --> 00:53:00,025
GOODNIGHT.

1203
00:53:00,068 --> 00:53:01,287
BYE! BYE!

1204
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,336
THIS IS SO EXCITING!

1205
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:10,078
OH, BRITT, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU LIVE HERE!

1206
00:53:10,122 --> 00:53:12,037
ABOUT 30 YEARS NOW.

1207
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:16,737
THIS IS, THIS IS, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO CALL IT.

1208
00:53:16,781 --> 00:53:18,870
VINTAGE MAYBE?

1209
00:53:18,913 --> 00:53:20,306
POSSIBLY.

1210
00:53:20,349 --> 00:53:30,403
[ROMANTIC MUSIC]

1211
00:53:30,403 --> 00:53:38,324
[ROMANTIC MUSIC]

1212
00:53:38,367 --> 00:53:40,892
SMALLER THAN I THOUGHT.

1213
00:53:40,935 --> 00:53:43,459
WELL, IT'S A BOAT.

1214
00:53:43,503 --> 00:53:46,898
CAN I GET YOU A GLASS
OF WATER OR SOMETHING?

1215
00:53:46,941 --> 00:53:50,249
OH, NO.
NO, THANK YOU.

1216
00:53:50,292 --> 00:53:52,555
YOU REALLY LIVE HERE?

1217
00:53:52,599 --> 00:53:57,735
YES. YES.

1218
00:53:57,778 --> 00:53:59,998
FOR 30 YEARS?

1219
00:54:00,041 --> 00:54:01,521
WELL, OH YEAH.

1220
00:54:01,564 --> 00:54:03,088
IT'S PRETTY CLOSE
TO 30 YEARS, I THINK.

1221
00:54:03,131 --> 00:54:05,612
I DIDN'T KEEP EXACT TIME.

1222
00:54:05,655 --> 00:54:07,440
IT'S BEEN LONG ENOUGH I NEED TO,

1223
00:54:07,483 --> 00:54:11,531
I NEED TO SCRAPE THE BOTTOM
OF THIS BOAT.

1224
00:54:11,574 --> 00:54:14,316
SCRAPING?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1225
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:17,929
OH, YEAH. IT'S UH, UH,

1226
00:54:17,972 --> 00:54:20,540
THE BOTTOM OF THE BOAT
IS COVERED WITH,

1227
00:54:20,583 --> 00:54:23,282
OVER A PERIOD OF TIME IT
ACCUMULATES THINGS LIKE UH,

1228
00:54:23,325 --> 00:54:27,155
CRUSTACEANS OF VARIOUS SORTS
UH, BARNACLES

1229
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:29,636
AND SEA URCHINS
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

1230
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:31,290
AND YOU NEED TO
TAKE CARE OF THAT

1231
00:54:31,333 --> 00:54:33,161
ABOUT EVERY, OH,
SEVEN, TEN YEARS.

1232
00:54:33,205 --> 00:54:34,902
SEVEN YEARS I THINK
WOULD BE BEST.

1233
00:54:34,946 --> 00:54:37,165
IT'S BEEN OVER TEN YEARS
SINCE I'VE DONE IT.

1234
00:54:37,209 --> 00:54:40,168
SO, UH, I CAN SEE YOU
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS.

1235
00:54:40,212 --> 00:54:43,215
IT'S KIND OF LIKE UH,
IF IT WERE A CAR,

1236
00:54:43,258 --> 00:54:44,999
IT'D BE CHANGING THE OIL EVERY,

1237
00:54:45,043 --> 00:54:48,655
YOU KNOW, EVERY,
EVERY 3,000 MILES.

1238
00:54:48,698 --> 00:54:49,917
WELL, WITH A BOAT,

1239
00:54:49,961 --> 00:54:51,876
YOU HAVE TO REMOVE
THESE SEA URCHINS

1240
00:54:51,919 --> 00:54:54,661
AND I HAVE TO GET DOWN THERE
WITH MY SCUBA GEAR

1241
00:54:54,704 --> 00:54:57,795
AND, AND UM, SCRAPE THE BOTTOM.

1242
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:02,712
IT'S NOT VERY MUCH FUN.
SO ANYWAY...

1243
00:55:02,756 --> 00:55:07,065
YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T BEEN
ON A BOAT IN A LONG TIME.

1244
00:55:07,108 --> 00:55:09,676
AND YOU SEEM LIKE
A REALLY NICE MAN.

1245
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:11,809
I MEAN, A REAL GENTLEMAN.

1246
00:55:11,852 --> 00:55:14,986
BUT I THINK YOU REALLY
DESERVE BETTER THAN THIS.

1247
00:55:15,029 --> 00:55:17,597
REALLY?

1248
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:20,948
WELL, THAT'S NICE
OF YOU TO SAY SO.

1249
00:55:20,992 --> 00:55:22,863
BRITT...

1250
00:55:33,439 --> 00:55:34,744
POOP OR GET OFF THE POT!

1251
00:55:34,788 --> 00:55:37,443
YOU MEAN, I SHOULD DO THAT.

1252
00:55:37,486 --> 00:55:38,923
SURE!

1253
00:55:38,966 --> 00:55:40,707
I KNOW. WELL, I THINK HE SHOULD
SHUT HIS GODDAMN MOUTH,

1254
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:42,709
MOVE OUT AND GET A JOB
IS WHAT I THINK.

1255
00:55:42,752 --> 00:55:46,365
YEAH, BUT SHE'S HIS MOTHER.

1256
00:55:46,408 --> 00:55:47,888
I MEAN,
THERE'S A RELATIONSHIP THERE.

1257
00:55:47,932 --> 00:55:48,976
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

1258
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,238
WE HAVE A RELATIONSHIP, TOO.

1259
00:55:50,282 --> 00:55:51,413
NO YOU DON'T.

1260
00:55:51,457 --> 00:55:52,458
YES, WE DO.

1261
00:55:52,501 --> 00:55:54,068
DON'T TELL ME
WHAT I DON'T HAVE.

1262
00:55:54,112 --> 00:55:54,982
WELL, YOU JUST...

1263
00:55:55,026 --> 00:55:56,592
DAMMIT! I HAVE A RELATIONSHIP!

1264
00:55:56,636 --> 00:55:58,681
I KNOW WHETHER I GOT
A RELATIONSHIP OR NOT.

1265
00:55:58,725 --> 00:56:00,770
YOU DON'T KNOW A DAMN
THING ABOUT IT, JESSE.

1266
00:56:00,814 --> 00:56:02,294
ALL I KNOW IS
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

1267
00:56:02,337 --> 00:56:04,513
WELL, YEAH, BUT
YOU'RE MISINTERPRETING.

1268
00:56:04,557 --> 00:56:05,950
CRYSTAL'S ALWAYS TRYING
TO PUT TOGETHER

1269
00:56:05,993 --> 00:56:07,734
SOME SORT OF COCKTAIL PARTY

1270
00:56:07,777 --> 00:56:11,129
OR GET TOGETHER SO I'LL TALK TO
HER ABOUT IT. WHO KNOWS?

1271
00:56:11,172 --> 00:56:13,305
GOOD.
YOU DO THAT.

1272
00:56:13,348 --> 00:56:14,654
I BET THAT WAS REALLY,

1273
00:56:14,697 --> 00:56:17,004
THAT WOULD PROBABLY
REALLY IMPRESSED CYNTHIA.

1274
00:56:17,048 --> 00:56:18,832
YOU THINK THAT'D DO
YOU SOME GOOD, HUH?

1275
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:20,007
YEAH, I THINK IT WOULD.

1276
00:56:20,051 --> 00:56:22,357
ALRIGHT. ALRIGHT.

1277
00:56:22,401 --> 00:56:23,532
YEAH, I'LL TALK TO CRYSTAL

1278
00:56:23,576 --> 00:56:25,186
AND WE'LL SEE WHAT
WE CAN PUT TOGETHER.

1279
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:27,188
ALRIGHT. HOW SOON DO YOU
THINK YOU COULD DO THAT?

1280
00:56:27,232 --> 00:56:29,103
I DON'T KNOW.

1281
00:56:29,147 --> 00:56:32,019
MY WIFE'S IN CHARGE OF
THE SOCIAL CALENDAR.

1282
00:56:32,063 --> 00:56:33,586
SO I'LL TALK TO HER
BUT I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

1283
00:56:33,629 --> 00:56:36,154
I MEAN, I SEE HER EVERY
FEW DAYS, ANYWAY, SO.

1284
00:56:36,197 --> 00:56:38,678
IN THE MEANTIME, TAKE HER --

1285
00:56:38,721 --> 00:56:40,419
BUY HER A HAMBURGER.
TAKE HER TO A MOVIE.

1286
00:56:40,462 --> 00:56:42,073
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY ANYTHING
TO CYNTHIA TILL YOU KNOW.

1287
00:56:42,116 --> 00:56:43,378
YEAH, EXACTLY.

1288
00:56:43,422 --> 00:56:44,597
I DON'T WANT TO
DISAPPOINT HER AND SAY,

1289
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:45,467
"YEAH, WE'RE GOING OVER
TO DAVID'S PLACE"

1290
00:56:45,511 --> 00:56:46,991
AND END UP TELLING HER,

1291
00:56:47,034 --> 00:56:48,601
"NO, HIS WIFE DIDN'T WANT ME
TO COME OVER THEIR PLACE."

1292
00:56:48,644 --> 00:56:50,472
YOU KNOW,
I'M A LITTLE BIT PARANOID

1293
00:56:50,516 --> 00:56:51,821
ABOUT THOSE KIND OF THINGS.

1294
00:56:51,865 --> 00:56:53,301
WELL, IT'S TRUE.

1295
00:56:53,345 --> 00:56:56,000
UNCOMFORTABLE IN SOCIAL CIRCLES
AND STUFF LIKE THAT, SO.

1296
00:56:58,002 --> 00:56:58,959
I JUST DON'T KNOW.

1297
00:56:59,003 --> 00:57:00,961
YOU KNOW,
I TRY TO BE HONEST.

1298
00:57:01,005 --> 00:57:04,182
BUT THERE'S A FINE LINE
BETWEEN BEING HONEST AND,

1299
00:57:04,225 --> 00:57:07,533
AND, UH, CONFESSING AND
BRAGGING, FOR EXAMPLE.

1300
00:57:07,576 --> 00:57:10,884
I DON'T WANT TO BE A BRAGGART.
YOU KNOW.

1301
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:12,364
TALK ABOUT THE WOMEN,
FOR GOD'S SAKES.

1302
00:57:12,407 --> 00:57:14,540
I, I JUST DON'T KNOW ABOUT
THIS STUFF.

1303
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:15,541
I JUST DON'T KNOW.

1304
00:57:15,584 --> 00:57:17,978
YEAH. YEAH.
I APPRECIATE THAT.

1305
00:57:18,022 --> 00:57:19,632
YOU'VE DONE A LOT
OF THINGS, BOB.

1306
00:57:19,675 --> 00:57:22,940
I MEAN, YOU'RE...A SOLDIER,
PARATROOPER, BUSH PILOT,

1307
00:57:22,983 --> 00:57:24,985
YOU KNOW, ALL THOSE
VARIOUS THINGS

1308
00:57:25,029 --> 00:57:30,251
AND UH, IN SOME WAYS A CRIMINAL,
EVEN A KILLER.

1309
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,255
I DON'T KNOW.

1310
00:57:34,299 --> 00:57:35,561
IT'S, WITHIN THE
CONTEXT OF THE BOOK

1311
00:57:35,604 --> 00:57:37,693
IT ALL KIND OF TRACKS TO ME.

1312
00:57:37,737 --> 00:57:42,481
WELL, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T
WRITE THIS TO UH, REDEMPTION.

1313
00:57:42,524 --> 00:57:43,699
I'M JUST TRYING TO BE HONEST

1314
00:57:43,743 --> 00:57:45,788
AND TELL PEOPLE WHO I AM
AND WHAT I'VE DONE

1315
00:57:45,832 --> 00:57:51,664
AND MY, MY EDITOR SAID THAT'S
WHERE THE VALUE IN THE STORY IS,

1316
00:57:51,707 --> 00:57:52,970
IS IN THE HONESTY

1317
00:57:53,013 --> 00:57:56,538
AND THAT GIVES A STORY
INTEGRITY AND WHATNOT.

1318
00:57:56,582 --> 00:57:58,410
SO, I JUST DON'T KNOW.

1319
00:57:58,453 --> 00:58:00,151
YOU KNOW, I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHERE TO DRAW THE LINE.

1320
00:58:00,194 --> 00:58:05,808
I, I, BOY, I JUST DON'T KNOW.

1321
00:58:05,852 --> 00:58:08,420
WELL, AT LEAST YOU'VE
GOT A STORY TO TELL.

1322
00:58:08,463 --> 00:58:10,161
I MEAN, THERE ARE LOTS
OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T.

1323
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:20,780
DELICATE AROMAS AND FLAVORS
OF PEACH, PINEAPPLE, JASMINE,

1324
00:58:20,823 --> 00:58:26,177
AND GINGER DELIVER
A SLIGHTLY SPICY WINE.

1325
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:28,266
ENHANCED BY A
SUBTLE FLORAL TONES

1326
00:58:28,309 --> 00:58:31,486
AND APPEALING TOUCH
OF EARTHINESS.

1327
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:35,664
THE FINISH IS LONG WITH LICORICE
SPICE AND A TOUCH OF PEPPER.

1328
00:58:35,708 --> 00:58:39,712
YOU KNOW, I THINK DAVID
WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE THIS.

1329
00:58:39,755 --> 00:58:41,583
AND IT'S ONLY $5.99.

1330
00:58:41,627 --> 00:58:42,758
I THINK YOUR FRIEND
WOULD LOVE IT.

1331
00:58:42,802 --> 00:58:43,890
LET ME GET IT.

1332
00:58:43,933 --> 00:58:44,673
REALLY?

1333
00:58:44,717 --> 00:58:45,718
SURE!

1334
00:58:50,157 --> 00:58:52,072
CHRIS, I'D LIKE TO HAVE YOU
MEET CYNTHIA.

1335
00:58:52,116 --> 00:58:53,465
CYNTHIA'S A FRIEND OF BRITT'S.

1336
00:58:53,508 --> 00:58:54,596
HOW DO YOU DO?

1337
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:55,902
SORRY, I WAS UPSTAIRS
GETTING READY.

1338
00:58:55,945 --> 00:58:57,121
YOU'VE MET BRITT BEFORE.

1339
00:58:57,164 --> 00:58:58,731
HMM, YES I HAVE.

1340
00:59:03,431 --> 00:59:05,085
SO WHAT A DAY, HUH?

1341
00:59:05,129 --> 00:59:06,173
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

1342
00:59:06,217 --> 00:59:08,045
HARDLY GET THEM AROUND HERE.

1343
00:59:08,088 --> 00:59:11,526
SO, CYNTHIA, I UNDERSTAND
YOU MET BRITT ON THE COMPUTER?

1344
00:59:11,570 --> 00:59:13,572
OH YES, ON THIS
WONDERFUL WEBSITE

1345
00:59:13,615 --> 00:59:16,357
CALLED SENIORCONNECTION.COM.

1346
00:59:16,401 --> 00:59:21,101
MMM. WELL, SO, HOW LONG
HAVE YOU AND BRITT BEEN DATING?

1347
00:59:21,145 --> 00:59:24,409
WELL, I THINK IT'S ABOUT
TWO WEEKS NOW?

1348
00:59:24,452 --> 00:59:25,932
BUT YOU KNOW,
WE TALK TO EACH OTHER

1349
00:59:25,975 --> 00:59:29,153
ALMOST EVERY DAY ON THE PHONE.

1350
00:59:32,852 --> 00:59:34,549
MMM.
I'M SORRY.

1351
00:59:34,593 --> 00:59:40,903
EXCUSE ME FOR BEING RUDE.
YOUR HOME IS JUST BEAUTIFUL.

1352
00:59:40,947 --> 00:59:42,514
OH, THANK YOU.

1353
00:59:42,557 --> 00:59:44,124
I'M NOT SURE
DAVID EVEN NOTICES.

1354
00:59:44,168 --> 00:59:45,517
