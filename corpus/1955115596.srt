1
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:35,489
Hi, Lia.

2
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:37,492
You want me to
read you a story?

3
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:43,955
Once upon a time on the
edge of a great forest,

4
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:46,958
there lived a woodcutter
and his wife.

5
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,337
They were poor and had
barely enough to live on,

6
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:52,381
but they loved each
other and they loved

7
00:02:52,382 --> 00:02:54,300
their two children,
Hansel and Gretel.

8
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:57,594
It was a time of
famine in the forest,

9
00:02:57,595 --> 00:02:59,096
and the woodcutter
and his wife could

10
00:02:59,097 --> 00:03:01,932
hardly find food to
fill their own bellies.

11
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:03,642
Let alone their two children.

12
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:04,894
They didn't know what to do.

13
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:08,480
In the end
the woodcutter said,

14
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:10,941
"we'll have to take the
children into the woods,

15
00:03:10,942 --> 00:03:12,819
<i>"and leave them to
fend for themselves."</i>

16
00:03:14,654 --> 00:03:18,198
<i>While his wife was still
sleeping the next morning,</i>

17
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:21,910
<i>he took the children out with
him when he went to chop wood.</i>

18
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:25,914
<i>He said, "Sit and sleep under
this tree while I get to work.</i>

19
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:27,434
"I'll wake you when
it's time to go home."

20
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:30,877
But when they
awoke it was dark,

21
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,547
and there was no
sign of their father.

22
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:36,926
They were alone in the big,
dark forest, all alone.

23
00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:45,392
Now Hansel and Gretel
were very scared.

24
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:48,019
They ran through the
woods, but everywhere

25
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,398
they'd see the wild
animals were waking.

26
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:54,776
Then they saw ahead of
them a wonderful house

27
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:58,155
that looked like a giant tree,
but inside there lived

28
00:03:58,156 --> 00:04:01,033
a wicked witch who killed
children and ate them.

29
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:05,705
And when the children came
closer the tree began to move.

30
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,432
Scotty, you better
practice that Nintendo,

31
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:09,751
because when I get
home I'm gonna win.

32
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,918
- No way!
- Yeah!

33
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,629
I'll beat you,
no way, no no no!

34
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,717
Hello, little beauty,
you little beauty!

35
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:20,303
Bye, baby!

36
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:23,431
Bye, Diana.
We'll see you Sunday night.

37
00:05:27,537 --> 00:05:29,914
Honey, you're gonna love this.
I forgot my glasses.

38
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,289
Alan!

39
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:57,293
Alan!
Alan!

40
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:01,589
The blood of the
child is pure now.

41
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:05,092
In death it gives you life.

42
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,684
The cycle is complete.

43
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:21,442
Begin another.

44
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,350
<i>George, call on
Line 27 please, George.</i>

45
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:02,023
- You expecting snow?
- Oh!

46
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:03,149
- Phil Sterling, right?
- Yeah.

47
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,359
- Ralph Hess.
- Good to meet you.

48
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,695
Welcome to the
belly of the beast.

49
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:12,951
<i>Call Mr. Zeller when
you can, Pamela, Mr. Zeller.</i>

50
00:08:12,952 --> 00:08:14,662
I'll look at those lists
this afternoon, okay?

51
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,164
<i>Vince,
Line 17, Vince.</i>

52
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,624
Gail, say hello
to Phil Sterling.

53
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,584
Hello.

54
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:22,544
- How was the flight?
- Terrific.

55
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:24,005
- First time in LA?
- Yeah.

56
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:31,679
This is terrific.
Great face.

57
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:34,598
<i>Nancy Roman,
you have a call on Line 18.</i>

58
00:08:38,728 --> 00:08:39,937
These are all good.

59
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:43,231
It's unusual to see a
public service campaign

60
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:44,900
with a sense of humor
and irreverence.

61
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:46,901
Thank you.

62
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:48,028
We're doin' a lot
of public service,

63
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:49,320
and there's no reason
why it shouldn't look

64
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:50,739
just as good as the rest
of our stuff, you know?

65
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,906
I understand.

66
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:53,324
Well, at the
agency in Chicago,

67
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:55,452
it was a hands-on
thing for you.

68
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:57,412
It's a little
different out here.

69
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:58,706
We have media planners,

70
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:01,500
marketing consultants,
creative directors.

71
00:09:02,168 --> 00:09:03,753
Is that gonna be a problem?

72
00:09:04,754 --> 00:09:06,588
I'm happy where I am.

73
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:09,008
I built a reputation in Chicago,
and we love living there.

74
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:10,718
Do you want the job?

75
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:12,928
Yes.

76
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:20,102
Charming.

77
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:22,479
I can fix that.

78
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,067
Can we afford this?

79
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,818
We can rent it
for six months.

80
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:29,779
'Til we find something.

81
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:31,530
It has potential.

82
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:33,490
Potential?

83
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:34,699
We're comin'
from a two bedroom

84
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,071
apartment on the
west side of Chicago.

85
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:37,924
It's a Ned Runcie
house, did you know that?

86
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:41,999
- Runcie?
- Yeah, the architect.

87
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,176
You know that room
up there by the kitchen?

88
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:54,303
Yeah.

89
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:55,679
It's gonna make
a beautiful den.

90
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,223
Really?

91
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,117
You don't just wanna
have a guest bedroom?

92
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:00,976
I don't want any guests.

93
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:03,646
Who do we know anyway?

94
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:05,854
What, do we think people are
gonna pop in from Chicago?

95
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:07,607
Oh, I don't know,
you never know,

96
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,276
somebody might
arrive unexpectedly.

97
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:11,695
One of your relatives?

98
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,115
Yeah, a relative,
you could say.

99
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:16,826
Only not to visit,
maybe permanently.

100
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:19,911
Your mother?

101
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:21,622
No, not my mother.

102
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,624
Smaller than my mother, smaller.

103
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,918
Oh, God, smaller
than your mother.

104
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,546
A rat.

105
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:30,880
A mouse,
an ant, a germ.

106
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:34,677
That's close.
Try sperm and you're warm.

107
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,059
Jesus.

108
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,331
Hello?

109
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:05,957
- Hi.
- Hi.

110
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,584
<i>I'm just twin' to
fix your door here.</i>

111
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:09,587
I really meant to do this
before you moved in, but...

112
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:12,173
I'm Ned Runcie.

113
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:15,258
Honey, come meet the man
who designed this house!

114
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:16,885
Oh.
Yeah.

115
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:18,303
Hi, Ned Runcie.
How you doin'?

116
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:19,596
Hi, yeah.

117
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:20,680
You've built, what,
20 houses in the canyon?

118
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:22,599
Eh. 25.
Who's countin'?

119
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,434
- God, that's amazing.
- Can I get you some coffee?

120
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:25,810
No, no thanks.
God.

121
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:27,145
I'm gonna have some.

122
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:28,438
Look what they did to my floor.
Look at this!

123
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:29,772
Yeah, I was
wondering about that.

124
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,399
What'd they do, have bike
races in here or something?

125
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,193
God, you know, look,
I can have somebody

126
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:34,527
come in here
and polish this up,

127
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:35,945
and sand it up
for you, okay?

128
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:36,906
No, that's okay,
you don't have to...

129
00:11:36,907 --> 00:11:38,239
No, really,
come on. I wanna...

130
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,991
I cannot tell you how
happy I am to meet you.

131
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:41,242
I'm an interior designer myself.

132
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:42,493
Oh yeah?

133
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:43,454
Do you know his
homes have been

134
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:44,205
in Architectural Digest, Phil?

135
00:11:44,206 --> 00:11:45,455
Yeah.
This one.

136
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:46,207
This one was in
Architectural Digest.

137
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,249
- Really?
- Really?

138
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,375
Yes, before
they started having

139
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:49,501
bike races in the dining room.

140
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:51,753
Anyway, I just came
by to say hello.

141
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:53,046
I'm not gonna bother you.

142
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:54,214
I live right up the street
if you need anything.

143
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:55,465
I'm on Astral Drive,
it's kind of

144
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:56,633
a funny house with
a big chimney...

145
00:11:56,634 --> 00:11:57,884
Oh, I think I
know that house.

146
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,108
Skylights, yeah.
Yeah, that, yeah.

147
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,015
What the hell?

148
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:05,851
I think we just had a five.

149
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:12,650
Hey, look at this.

150
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:14,817
Not a crack.

151
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:21,492
I'm never gonna be human
looking again, you know?

152
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:32,878
I love you.

153
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:35,005
Roseanne Barr.

154
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:46,140
Harder now, harder,
Kate, give it all you got!

155
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:48,226
Come on, come on,
here comes the head!

156
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:50,646
Okay! Just breathe,
just breathe!

157
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:52,773
Okay, push. Come on!

158
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:54,692
Push, push, push!

159
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,360
Okay, the head is out!

160
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:58,861
It's a boy!

161
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,822
It's a boy! He looks great!

162
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:01,990
He looks real good!

163
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:03,241
He's beautiful.

164
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:04,618
I'll let you see
him in just a minute.

165
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:05,577
Okay, he looks real good,

166
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:07,268
we just gotta suction
him out here, okay?

167
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:23,554
Hi there.

168
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:26,557
Honey, he's so pretty.

169
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:34,356
Think we can
just about make it.

170
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,319
With both of us working, huh?

171
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:40,029
Yeah, why?

172
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,113
You havin' second thoughts?

173
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:42,780
No, I want to
work, I just want

174
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,116
to do what's right for Jake.

175
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:46,035
Hey.

176
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:49,413
Your folks worked.
Mine did. It's normal.

177
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:52,957
It's good for him to grow
up knowin' he's gotta work.

178
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,292
Isn't that right, Jake?

179
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:55,753
I agree, guzzle toes.

180
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,422
And I want to keep my
decorator's license, you know?

181
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,882
But I'm just having such
a good time doing this,

182
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:02,634
I just don't wanna
miss out on anything.

183
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,511
Well, do this for two years.

184
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:07,230
Then we'll be solid enough,
you can do what you want.

185
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:08,849
Okay.

186
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,809
Well, I've looked up
some child care agencies.

187
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,437
I think we oughta try
this one, Guardian Angel.

188
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:15,606
It's in Santa Monica.

189
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:36,834
It's your turn.

190
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,046
It was my turn last time.

191
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:41,757
No, you slept
through my turn.

192
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:45,219
Let's both sleep
through my turn.

193
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:46,803
Go!

194
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,146
You know sleep deprivation

195
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,649
is a well-known
form of torture?

196
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,948
Hey, Jakey.
Hey, buddy.

197
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,659
Open up, come on.

198
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:10,911
Yeah.

199
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:13,956
I work Mrs. Honez,

200
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:16,250
Herman Oaks,
three years.

201
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:20,711
I work Mr. and Mrs. Hansen,

202
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:23,465
four years in Longa Bee.

203
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,467
- Longa Bee?
- Longa Bee.

204
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:29,054
- Oh, Long Beach!
- Ah, si, si!

205
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:32,765
I suppose you'll want to
breastfeed, don't you, Kate?

206
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,350
For the first six months.

207
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:35,768
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

208
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,103
Six months?

209
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,845
Dr. Klein said that four
months would be plenty.

210
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:42,151
Well, of course there are
differing opinions these days.

211
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,360
Well, actually,
I've been having

212
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,028
some difficulty, it's
too watery or something.

213
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:48,906
You like television,
Mrs. Horniman?

214
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:51,784
Oh yes, I love the comedies.

215
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,829
Family Ties,
The Golden Girls.

216
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,289
And the good,
heartwarming stuff.

217
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,874
See, I've only
looked after one baby,

218
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,417
you know, it's not the
kinda thing that I wanna do

219
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:00,836
for the rest of my
life or anything.

220
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:03,337
Well, actually,
Ms. Russell, we were

221
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:05,006
really only thinking about
the next four or five years.

222
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:07,049
Ms. Russell?
Please, call me Arlene.

223
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,593
Okay-

224
00:16:08,594 --> 00:16:09,927
You see, what I wanna do
is I wanna teach Phys Ed.

225
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:12,513
I'm taking evening classes
over at Claremont College,

226
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:13,764
so we would definitely have to

227
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:15,559
work out some kind of schedule.

228
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:17,603
We can do that.

229
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:19,937
I just can't get over
a baby learning to swim

230
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:21,606
at one month, put this
little thing in water?

231
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:23,191
Yeah, that's the
time you start 'em.

232
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:24,942
See, kids are natural
swimmers, they haven't

233
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,819
learned to be frightened
of things like water yet.

234
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,739
I mean, the world's
moving so fast, and...

235
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:30,823
Well, I think children
need interaction

236
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,200
with other children, don't you?

237
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:33,285
Yeah, I do, actually.

238
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:36,538
Um, do you have a
steady boyfriend?

239
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:40,167
Nobody I've met
so far quite makes the grade.

240
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,168
These references?

241
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,545
Oh, yes.

242
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:48,509
Is there anything you'd
like to ask us, Miss...?

243
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:49,717
Grandier.

244
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:52,720
Yes, how old is your son?

245
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,388
He'll be two
weeks this Thursday.

246
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,266
- Oh, October's child!
- Yep.

247
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:58,685
- Libra.
- Right.

248
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,981
Is it possible to see him?

249
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:05,942
: Sweetheart?

250
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:08,320
You awake? There's
somebody here to see you.

251
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,656
Yeah, you have a visitor.

252
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:16,827
He's beautiful.
What's his name?

253
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:17,788
Jake.

254
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:19,206
Hello, Jake.

255
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,834
Yes.
Such a dear boy.

256
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:24,670
Is he breastfeeding?

257
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:26,337
No, I tried him in the first

258
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:27,797
few days
but he didn't like it.

259
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:29,465
My colostrum was too watery.

260
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:30,717
He seems happier on the formula.

261
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:33,511
The milk comes
from deep inside you,

262
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:35,346
it's supposed to be watery.

263
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:37,098
Water's what he needs most.

264
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,475
Especially in the first month.

265
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:40,768
And you know,
there are antibodies

266
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:42,853
in a mother's milk that
no formula can duplicate.

267
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,147
So you think I
should try again?

268
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:46,483
Yeah.
It's really important.

269
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,152
Did you know that
after four weeks,

270
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:51,697
their little blood cells change?

271
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,533
Yeah.

272
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,744
After four weeks they're
not baby cells anymore.

273
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:00,038
They're just like ours.

274
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,377
She's very attractive.

275
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:06,752
Not bad.

276
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,839
Some might say
too attractive.

277
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:11,133
Do I detect a
note of jealousy?

278
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:13,760
No, just a note of concern.

279
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:15,970
You tell me first.

280
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:17,055
No, you go first.

281
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:18,932
Write it down.

282
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:20,517
Okay-

283
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:22,811
Wait, wait, wait!

284
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,023
Ready?
Go.

285
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:44,458
Hi!

286
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,167
Hello, Mrs. Sterling.

287
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:47,251
You can call me Kate.

288
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:48,252
Oh, thank you!

289
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:49,253
Come in,
Ms. Grandier.

290
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:56,678
Call me Camilla.

291
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:06,647
Hello, Jake.

292
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:10,484
I brought some
friends to meet you.

293
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:14,237
This is Holt.

294
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,868
And this is Jamara.

295
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,665
And this...

296
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,543
Is Pyewacket.

297
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,633
They're your friends, Jake.

298
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:38,387
They're your bestest friends.

It's raining!

323
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,245
Hello, Mr. Sterling.

324
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:11,957
- Excuse me.
- It's all right.

325
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:14,751
You feel that?

326
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:16,659
Yeah, it was just another
earthquake, wasn't it?

327
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:18,338
I was,
I couldn't sleep,

328
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:20,089
and I came up to the
baby's room <i>and...</i>

329
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,423
It's okay.

330
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,843
I ran the bath and
guess who woke

331
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:26,596
up and decided
it was playtime?

332
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:30,308
You are so
cheeky, aren't you?

333
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:31,934
You are.

334
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:36,481
I think we're
so lucky sometimes.

335
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,442
Jake's the lucky one.
Aren't you?

336
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:41,361
To have a father like you.

337
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:45,532
I never knew my father.

338
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:48,118
And my mother died when I was...

339
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:50,495
not much bigger than Jake.

340
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:52,872
I'm sorry.

341
00:22:54,374 --> 00:22:56,000
Do you want to
put him down now?

342
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:57,002
I think he's about ready.

343
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:06,927
Good night, buddy.

344
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:09,681
Sweet dreams.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

345
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,311

Shh.

jangled nerves.</i>

354
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:05,277
<i>The usual for
southern California.</i>

355
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,029
<i>If I hear anything
else I'll let you know;</i>

356
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,948
<i>otherwise, let's just
keep slidin' through</i>

357
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:11,825
<i>the night together
on KCRW with a piece</i>

358
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:14,536
<i>by the Sydney-based group,
Not Drowning Waving,</i>

359
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:15,997
<i>from their album Claim.</i>

360
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:16,576
Soon, Jake, soon.

361
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:19,496
It will be time to go
to the sacred forest.

362
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,460
You'll have mother's milk today.

363
00:26:26,878 --> 00:26:27,962
You missed it,
didn't you?

364
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:29,798
Yeah.

365
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:42,602
Hey, sweetheart.

366
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:44,687
What's happenin'?

367
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,357
Is that your
purse over there?

368
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:51,778
What's your name,
little guy?

369
00:26:57,784 --> 00:26:58,784
What's the matter?

370
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:00,662
Cat got your tongue?

371
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:03,373
Hey, is that
little guy yours?

372
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:05,542
Yes.

373
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,264
You know you shouldn't
be out here so late.

374
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:08,670
It gets weird out here.

375
00:27:09,504 --> 00:27:11,005
Would you like
us to walk you home?

376
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:13,633
- No, thank you.
- Why not?

377
00:27:15,343 --> 00:27:17,303
Keep away.
I warn you.

378
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:18,971
Ooh!

379
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:20,181
You warn me?

380
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,560
You don't fuckin' warn me.

381
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:25,102
Bitch.

382
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,021
I...

383
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:29,815
warn...

384
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,402
YOU.

385
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:38,115
Hey, where you gain'?

386
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:39,325
Hey!
Come on back!

387
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,635
Where the fuck did she go?

388
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:44,264
I need a fuckin' beer.

389
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:45,767
Oh, shit.

390
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:48,519
Fuckin' bitch.

391
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:06,621
I think she came this way.

392
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,040
What do you think?

393
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,217
You ever been
out here before?

394
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:20,593
No.

395
00:29:56,921 --> 00:30:00,425
The fuck?
Fuck.

396
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:21,487
We're gonna have some fun!

397
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:24,991
Aren't we?
You and me.

398
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:26,783
Right?

399
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:33,833
Ooh!

400
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:36,794
Well, how you doin'
there, big boy?

401
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:39,921
You wanna come out and play?

402
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:41,758
Leave him alone!

403
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:48,890
Look at this.
See, see this?

404
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:51,184
You like this?

405
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:53,227
Cut the bitch!

406
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,940
Hmm?
What's this?

407
00:30:59,317 --> 00:31:02,236
Mmm, oh!
Pretty!

408
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:09,285
What the hell is that?

409
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:11,829
Look out!

410
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,000
Hi, I'm Gail.

411
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:00,795
- Good to see you.
- It's a great place, man.

412
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:04,966
Hello.
Do come in.

413
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,301
Hi.

414
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,262
Anyway, they've bought us
on this 75 second commercial,

415
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:13,056
and we said, "Look, we're
telling a story in this ad."

416
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:14,766
It's the most
successful campaign.

417
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:16,351
You can't believe
the product now.

418
00:32:16,352 --> 00:32:17,894
That is...

419
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:18,979
It was good.

420
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,730
But getting back to
the one we did...

421
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:21,815
Tell the story, it's funny,
it has a beginning,

422
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:23,275
middle, and end.

423
00:32:23,276 --> 00:32:24,318
Sex, violence.

424
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:26,153
So that's your
best commercial,

425
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:27,071
what's your second
best commercial?

426
00:32:27,072 --> 00:32:28,531
I'm not saying it's the best!

427
00:32:29,574 --> 00:32:31,784
When I was a little kid,
I'm like 13 years old, right?

428
00:32:32,702 --> 00:32:34,619
And my parents made the
mistake of leaving me

429
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,121
in the house all
alone for a weekend.

430
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:37,081
That was a big mistake.

431
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:38,290
Yes.

432
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:40,000
When they came back,
I had completely,

433
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:41,960
totally, rebuilt
the living room.

434
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:43,128
Stop!
I did!

435
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:44,838
I put in skylights,
this is the truth,

436
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:46,631
and a little bathroom
with terracotta tiles...

437
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:47,632
You were 13?

438
00:32:48,301 --> 00:32:49,551
I took a clay and a half.

439
00:32:49,552 --> 00:32:50,760
Where'd you get the money?

440
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:52,095
What'd they say?

441
00:32:52,096 --> 00:32:53,763
They loved it, they
hired me to do the garage.

442
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:56,247
Why didn't you just
ask their permission?

443
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,937
Would you let a 13-year-old
rebuild your house?

444
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,105
What is the story
with that woman?

445
00:33:02,106 --> 00:33:03,523
I mean, she cooks,
she cleans,

446
00:33:03,524 --> 00:33:04,650
she takes care of the baby.

447
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:06,277
What else does she do?

448
00:33:06,903 --> 00:33:07,903
Shopping-

449
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:10,447
It's unbelievable.
Where's she from?

450
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:11,990
She's from England.
London.

451
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:14,177
She used to work at Orman Street
Hospital for sick children.

452
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:16,496
HEY, how'd you guys find her?

453
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:18,997
Well, that's the
really strange thing,

454
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:21,375
we had originally liked
this other girl better.

455
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:24,794
She wasn't your first choice?

456
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,671
I wanna see the first choice,
I want her phone number.

457
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:28,299
I'm serious!

458
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:51,280
<i>You okay?</i>

459
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:00,914
Hey.
Somethin' wrong?

460
00:34:00,915 --> 00:34:02,291
No, nothing.

461
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:04,877
I'm fine.
It was an accident.

462
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,256
- Let me see that.
- No, please.

463
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:12,301
- Do you have a doctor?
- Yes.

464
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:15,136
Who?
Who you seein'?

465
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:16,806
Oh, I have an
appointment tomorrow.

466
00:34:18,182 --> 00:34:19,224
Where?

467
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:20,267
In Westwood.

468
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:21,810
How you gonna get down there?

469
00:34:21,811 --> 00:34:22,852
Oh, uh...

470
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:24,187
You know, I could
take you, if you...

471
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:27,399
Oh, no, thanks.
Really, it's all right.

472
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,567
- You sure?
- You're very kind.

473
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:29,568
Yes, thank you.

474
00:34:31,654 --> 00:34:32,654
Okay-

475
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:41,581
Look what I got!

476
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:44,833
Oh God,
look at that!

477
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:46,418
Aw, look at him!

478
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:47,670
- Aw, he's so...
- Unbelievable!

479
00:34:48,296 --> 00:34:49,546
You guys did this?

480
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:50,172
- He's great, isn't he?
- Can I hold him?

481
00:34:50,173 --> 00:34:51,423
Yeah, sure.

482
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:52,717
Looks like Winston Churchill.

483
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:55,093
He doesn't smoke cigars yet.

484
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:56,720
What a sweetie!

485
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:58,556
What, did you want to
hold him, Ralph? Huh?

486
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:05,646
Camilla.

487
00:35:08,316 --> 00:35:10,358
They ever give you a night
off around here?

488
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:11,359
Yes, every Tuesday.

489
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:13,237
- Tomorrow?
- Mm-hm.

490
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:16,031
Hey, I've got a house
gain' up around the corner.

491
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:17,032
On Sultari.

492
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,117
It's pretty interesting, really.

493
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:20,702
It's a lot different
from this one.

494
00:35:20,703 --> 00:35:21,954
You could come by,
check it out.

495
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:26,167
Uh, no, I don't
think so, thank you.

496
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:28,794
Well, maybe when
you're feelin' better.

497
00:35:29,295 --> 00:35:30,879
- Okay.
- Okay, great.

498
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,339
- I'll see you.
- Thank you.

499
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,716
Okay, bye!
Great meeting you!

500
00:35:34,717 --> 00:35:36,301
And you have a beautiful baby!

501
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:37,886
- Thank you!
- You're so lucky!

502
00:35:37,887 --> 00:35:39,680
- Thank you!
- Bye!

503
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,143
Come on, sweetheart.

504
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:46,979
Go to sleep for Daddy,
come on.

505
00:35:51,692 --> 00:35:52,818
Come on, Jakey.

506
00:35:53,736 --> 00:35:55,571
Go to sleep, baby,
come on.

507
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,492
Yeah, go to sleep for Daddy.

508
00:38:56,877 --> 00:38:58,254
What is it, honey?

509
00:39:00,798 --> 00:39:01,966
Nothing.

510
00:39:23,988 --> 00:39:25,030
Morning.

511
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:27,156
How's Jake?

512
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:29,076
Slept like a log.
How 'bout you?

513
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:35,791
Would you like some breakfast?

514
00:39:36,876 --> 00:39:38,586
Just a coffee.
Black.

515
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,629
Please.

516
00:40:12,286 --> 00:40:15,664
Aw, hey, don't work
too hard today, okay?

517
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:20,336
Have a good day, Jake.

518
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:32,764
Have a nice day,
Mr. Sterling.

519
00:40:32,765 --> 00:40:33,765
Thanks.

520
00:40:37,895 --> 00:40:39,355
Can you feel it, Jake?

521
00:40:40,356 --> 00:40:42,775
In a few days your
blood is pure.

522
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,495
All right,
let's go see Camilla, okay?

523
00:40:56,914 --> 00:40:58,332
Hey.

524
00:40:58,874 --> 00:40:59,959
Hi.

525
00:41:06,006 --> 00:41:07,256
You look good.

526
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:08,257
Thank you.

527
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:10,135
I started
breastfeeding today.

528
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:12,262
How'd it go?

529
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:14,181
It went well.
He loved it and it felt great.

530
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:20,145
Will you zip me up?

531
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:22,730
What's with the bandage?

532
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:24,024
Oh, it's just that cyst
I was telling you about.

533
00:41:24,233 --> 00:41:25,233
- Yeah?
- Thanks.

534
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:27,820
So where you going?

535
00:41:28,112 --> 00:41:29,821
Down to Melrose,
to look at some shops.

536
00:41:29,822 --> 00:41:31,197
Meeting someone?

537
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:32,282
No, just me.

538
00:41:33,117 --> 00:41:35,285
I'm jealous.
I miss girls' night out.

539
00:41:35,661 --> 00:41:37,871
There were a bunch of crazy
art school girls in Chicago.

540
00:41:39,373 --> 00:41:40,957
That's how I met Phil, actually.

541
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:42,083
In a pizza parlor.

542
00:41:42,084 --> 00:41:43,752
They dared me to ask
him if he was a virgin.

543
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:45,462
Was he?

544
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:47,798
Actually, he's never
said to this day.

545
00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:50,091
So how're you gonna get there?

546
00:41:50,092 --> 00:41:51,426
I'm gonna walk.

547
00:41:51,427 --> 00:41:52,344
Oh, don't walk, let
me give you a ride,

548
00:41:52,345 --> 00:41:53,845
you realize how far that is?

549
00:41:53,846 --> 00:41:55,805
Yeah, it's okay,
I love walking.

550
00:41:55,806 --> 00:41:56,890
Anyway, it'll do me good.

551
00:42:01,854 --> 00:42:02,854
So now remember,
burp him after

552
00:42:02,855 --> 00:42:04,147
each breast,
and if it gets sore,

553
00:42:04,148 --> 00:42:05,732
his formula's on the
kitchen table, okay?

554
00:42:05,733 --> 00:42:06,733
Okay-

555
00:42:08,694 --> 00:42:09,902
Night-night.
Bye!

556
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:10,821
- You be good.
- He'll miss you.

557
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:13,282
Aw, I'll miss him.

558
00:42:20,122 --> 00:42:22,249
Night!

559
00:43:03,373 --> 00:43:04,415
- Ned!
- Hi, Kate.

560
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:05,708
- Hi!
- How you doin'?

561
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:07,627
- Fine. Come on in.
- Thanks.

562
00:43:07,628 --> 00:43:09,837
Oh, dropped the duck.

563
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:12,006
How's
my favorite kid?

564
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:13,216
He's fine,
he's sleeping in

565
00:43:13,217 --> 00:43:14,675
the living room,
you wanna see him?

566
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:16,095
Actually, is Camilla around?

567
00:43:16,887 --> 00:43:18,846
No, she's not, was
she expecting you?

568
00:43:18,847 --> 00:43:20,723
No, well, we didn't
have formal plans,

569
00:43:20,724 --> 00:43:22,517
but I heard about
this band at work,

570
00:43:22,518 --> 00:43:24,310
and I thought maybe she'd
want to go check 'em out.

571
00:43:24,311 --> 00:43:25,978
I was gonna take her
down to her doctor first.

572
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:27,606
The doctor?

573
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:30,150
Yeah, she had somethin'
wrong with her side.

574
00:43:31,235 --> 00:43:33,277
Uh, she never said
anything about the doctor.

575
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:35,738
Actually, she said she was
gonna go window shopping.

576
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:37,782
She just left.
You could probably...

577
00:43:37,783 --> 00:43:39,576
- No.
- ...catch her.

578
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:42,703
Here, why don't
you take these?

579
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:44,914
No, come on, she just left!
You could probably catch her-

580
00:43:44,915 --> 00:43:46,374
Forget it,
I'm a little late...

581
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:47,875
Ned, come on.
Late for what?

582
00:43:47,876 --> 00:43:49,628
Late for Camilla,
go after her!

583
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:55,652
Camilla!

584
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:29,830
Camilla!

585
00:50:42,165 --> 00:50:43,250
Yes!

586
00:50:44,376 --> 00:50:46,378
Okay, um,
my name is Runcie.

587
00:50:47,462 --> 00:50:50,006
I'm at 1201 Astral Drive.

588
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:52,299
Right.

589
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,300
I want to report a...

590
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,761
Runcie.

591
00:50:55,428 --> 00:50:57,764
Yes, R-U-N-C...

592
00:50:58,848 --> 00:51:00,433
Look, just listen to me, please.

593
00:51:00,809 --> 00:51:02,018
Okay, um...

594
00:51:03,186 --> 00:51:05,939
There's coyotes in my yard.

595
00:51:07,482 --> 00:51:08,483
Yeah.

596
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:10,318
No, no, no,
I'm sure.

597
00:51:11,319 --> 00:51:12,319
Mm-hm.

598
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:14,447
What?

599
00:51:15,031 --> 00:51:16,950
No, don't tell me
it's impossible.

600
00:51:17,784 --> 00:51:19,786
Look, they're right outside
my fuckin' house, okay?

601
00:51:22,998 --> 00:51:24,915
Okay, they don't come
down until they're hungry,

602
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:26,668
that's fine, they're
hungry, all right!?

603
00:51:27,669 --> 00:51:29,151
They're hungry,
they're here, all right!?

604
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:33,717
Yeah.
No, no, listen, please.

605
00:51:34,426 --> 00:51:35,719
Send somebody, okay?

606
00:51:36,928 --> 00:51:38,305
Uh-huh.
Astral...

607
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:42,309
Hello?
Hello!

608
00:51:43,059 --> 00:51:44,227
Fuck!

609
00:51:45,645 --> 00:51:47,063
Fuck.

610
00:52:23,516 --> 00:52:25,476
<i>Hi, we're not home right
now, so leave a message</i>

611
00:52:25,477 --> 00:52:26,977
<i>after the tone and
we'll call you back.</i>

612
00:52:26,978 --> 00:52:28,063
<i>Thanks!
Bye.</i>

613
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,861
<i>Phil, listen to me.</i>

614
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:37,405
<i>I saw something tonight.</i>

615
00:52:39,658 --> 00:52:40,950
<i>I can't believe what I just saw.</i>

616
00:52:42,744 --> 00:52:43,870
<i>Camilla...</i>

617
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:48,249
<i>You gotta believe me!</i>

618
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:51,127
<i>Don't let that woman
back in your house!</i>

619
00:52:53,505 --> 00:52:56,424
Don't let that woman back in...

620
00:53:19,072 --> 00:53:20,072
Shit.

621
00:53:24,202 --> 00:53:25,578
Fuck!

622
00:53:27,205 --> 00:53:28,289
Jesus!

623
00:54:39,444 --> 00:54:41,029
You shouldn't
have followed me.

624
00:55:56,813 --> 00:55:58,481
You come down here,
I'll blow you away.

625
00:57:00,335 --> 00:57:03,670
<i>Mr. Sterling,
we don't know each other,</i>

626
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:05,715
<i>but my name is Molly Sheridan.</i>

627
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:09,510
<i>I got your number from
the Guardian Angel agency.</i>

628
00:57:11,554 --> 00:57:13,598
<i>I hope I'm not
inconveniencing you but...</i>

629
00:57:14,891 --> 00:57:16,434
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

630
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:18,811
<i>It's very important.</i>

631
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:21,981
<i>Will you please call me?</i>

632
00:57:22,857 --> 00:57:27,528
<i>My number's 805-295-8170.</i>

633
00:57:30,823 --> 00:57:32,700
<i>Phil, listen to me.</i>

634
00:57:33,368 --> 00:57:34,826
<i>I saw something tonight.</i>

635
00:57:34,827 --> 00:57:35,870
Mr. Sterling?

636
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:38,664
Would you come
and look at Jake?

637
00:57:38,665 --> 00:57:39,706
Something wrong?

638
00:57:39,707 --> 00:57:40,707
I'm not sure.

639
00:57:41,793 --> 00:57:42,961
What is it?

640
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:45,300
Well, I think he looks
a bit pale, don't you?

641
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:47,590
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

642
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:50,050
How you doin', Jakey?

643
00:57:50,051 --> 00:57:51,593
How you feelin'?

644
00:57:51,594 --> 00:57:53,679
I got worried about him
when I came in this morning.

645
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,264
He's usually awake,
and he wasn't.

646
00:57:56,182 --> 00:57:57,331
I don't know,
what do you think?

647
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:59,352
Maybe he just
needs some fresh air.

648
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:01,813
Do me a favor,
call Dr. Klein.

649
00:58:03,523 --> 00:58:05,233
Oh, I don't think it's
that serious, really.

650
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,777
Let's not guess.
Call Dr. Klein.

651
00:58:45,898 --> 00:58:47,190
Yes?

652
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:48,776
Mrs. Sheridan?
I'm Phil Sterling.

653
00:58:49,819 --> 00:58:52,363
Oh.
Please come in.

654
00:58:54,657 --> 00:58:55,950
This is my son Scott.

655
00:58:56,659 --> 00:58:57,659
Hello, Scott.

656
00:58:57,827 --> 00:58:59,037
Hi.

657
00:58:59,954 --> 00:59:01,748
Do you know a woman
called Diana Julian?

658
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:05,584
I'm sorry, I don't.

659
00:59:05,585 --> 00:59:06,793
It's not her name anyway;

660
00:59:06,794 --> 00:59:08,212
she always uses different names.

661
00:59:09,172 --> 00:59:10,715
But it is possible you know her.

662
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:12,925
Why do you think so?

663
00:59:13,509 --> 00:59:15,136
You know the
Guardian Angel agency?

664
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:17,637
Yes.

665
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:19,638
The person that takes care
of your child is from there?

666
00:59:20,141 --> 00:59:21,309
That's right.

667
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:23,852
The person that
took care of Lia.

668
00:59:23,853 --> 00:59:25,772
Diana Julian,
she called herself,

669
00:59:26,439 --> 00:59:28,941
was recommended by Guardian
Angel, or so we thought.

670
00:59:29,817 --> 00:59:31,569
She worked for us
just under a month.

671
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:33,780
We loved her.

672
00:59:34,655 --> 00:59:37,033
We trusted her,
and she took Lia away.

673
00:59:38,493 --> 00:59:39,994
Now the police can't find her.

674
00:59:41,496 --> 00:59:43,121
All her references, fake.

675
00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:44,916
All the addresses
she left us, fake.

676
00:59:46,459 --> 00:59:48,336
We didn't find out
'til it was too late.

677
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:51,505
I wanna help you,
Mrs. Sheridan, but I'm not...

678
00:59:51,506 --> 00:59:53,131
Don't you see,
the police are doing

679
00:59:53,132 --> 00:59:55,176
everything they can but
they think Lia is dead.

680
00:59:55,802 --> 00:59:57,595
If I thought that,
I couldn't go on.

681
00:59:59,097 --> 01:00:00,723
So I'm doing whatever I can.

682
01:00:02,517 --> 01:00:04,017
I hired a private
detective who got

683
01:00:04,018 --> 01:00:05,728
the client list
from Guardian Angel.

684
01:00:06,854 --> 01:00:09,273
I thought maybe somebody else
had this woman in their house.

685
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:11,567
I see.

686
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,236
I called everyone on
the list I could find.

687
01:00:14,237 --> 01:00:16,322
People have been
very cooperative.

688
01:00:18,324 --> 01:00:19,951
Apparently it's happened before.

689
01:00:22,745 --> 01:00:24,288
I am sure it's her.

690
01:00:24,789 --> 01:00:26,499
You have a young
child, don't you?

691
01:00:27,834 --> 01:00:29,043
A little boy?

692
01:00:29,293 --> 01:00:30,545
Yes, but...

693
01:00:31,546 --> 01:00:33,463
This is all too hard for
me to accept, I can't...

694
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:34,715
Who takes care of it?

695
01:00:35,675 --> 01:00:36,800
I understand
how you feel, but...

696
01:00:36,801 --> 01:00:38,761
No, you don't.
I hope you never do.

697
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:41,721
I hope you never
have to wake up

698
01:00:41,722 --> 01:00:43,599
and find out your worst
nightmare is real.

699
01:00:44,392 --> 01:00:45,689
Do you have a
picture of Ms. Julian?

700
01:00:46,894 --> 01:00:47,894
No.

701
01:00:48,354 --> 01:00:49,354
What does she look like?

702
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:51,941
She's about 27.

703
01:00:52,608 --> 01:00:57,989
My height, thin, grey eyes,
fair skin, attractive.

704
01:00:58,698 --> 01:00:59,949
She has an accent.

705
01:01:00,491 --> 01:01:01,491
What kind of accent?

706
01:01:01,993 --> 01:01:03,160
I'm not sure.

707
01:01:03,161 --> 01:01:04,662
European, I think,
maybe English.

708
01:01:05,413 --> 01:01:06,454
What color hair?

709
01:01:06,455 --> 01:01:07,915
Dark brown,
almost red.

710
01:01:09,542 --> 01:01:11,668
The girl who works for
us has light-colored hair.

711
01:01:11,669 --> 01:01:12,836
She's been...

712
01:01:12,837 --> 01:01:14,088
She has something
on her stomach.

713
01:01:14,881 --> 01:01:15,923
What?

714
01:01:16,132 --> 01:01:17,841
Like a mark or something.

715
01:01:17,842 --> 01:01:19,635
Here, on her stomach.

716
01:01:21,888 --> 01:01:22,972
You know her,
don't you?

717
01:01:24,182 --> 01:01:25,515
It's not possible.

718
01:01:25,516 --> 01:01:26,600
Is it Diana?

719
01:01:26,601 --> 01:01:27,476
It can't be.

720
01:01:27,477 --> 01:01:28,603
Will you let me see her?

721
01:01:28,811 --> 01:01:30,646
She could've changed
her appearance, but...

722
01:01:32,315 --> 01:01:33,816
I'll have to talk to her first.

723
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:36,068
No, no, it's not Camilla.

724
01:01:36,277 --> 01:01:37,278
Camilla?

725
01:01:37,445 --> 01:01:38,695
Why won't you let me see her?

726
01:01:38,696 --> 01:01:39,738
I will, but you're
gonna have to...

727
01:01:39,739 --> 01:01:40,907
Do you know where Lia is?

728
01:01:41,657 --> 01:01:42,658
No, Scott.

729
01:01:44,243 --> 01:01:45,243
I don't.

730
01:01:47,288 --> 01:01:48,288
What's this?

731
01:01:50,082 --> 01:01:51,709
Diana gave it to me.

732
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:05,597
What do you want me to do?

733
01:02:05,598 --> 01:02:07,557
I want you to arrange
for me to see her,

734
01:02:07,558 --> 01:02:08,851
without her knowing it.

735
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:11,270
If it is her, she'll panic,
and she's dangerous.

736
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:14,147
I don't believe it's Camilla.

737
01:02:14,148 --> 01:02:15,316
Our baby's fine.

738
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:17,609
She takes wonderful care of him,

739
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:18,694
as though he were hers.

740
01:02:19,612 --> 01:02:20,780
That's how we felt.

741
01:02:21,906 --> 01:02:23,115
How old is your son?

742
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,326
Four weeks.

743
01:02:26,994 --> 01:02:28,287
That was Lia's age.

744
01:02:29,622 --> 01:02:30,873
Last time I saw her.

745
01:02:37,505 --> 01:02:38,505
Camilla?

746
01:02:43,803 --> 01:02:45,012
Camilla?

747
01:02:58,901 --> 01:02:59,944
Oh, shit.

748
01:03:15,584 --> 01:03:16,669
Camilla?

749
01:03:32,393 --> 01:03:33,436
<i>Phil.</i>

750
01:03:34,437 --> 01:03:35,479
<i>Listen to me.</i>

751
01:03:36,689 --> 01:03:37,815
<i>I saw something tonight.</i>

752
01:03:39,859 --> 01:03:41,402
<i>I can't believe what I just saw.</i>

753
01:03:43,195 --> 01:03:44,280
<i>Camilla...</i>

754
01:03:47,408 --> 01:03:48,868
<i>You gotta believe me!</i>

755
01:03:53,622 --> 01:03:55,833
<i>Phil.
Listen to me.</i>

756
01:03:57,335 --> 01:03:58,711
<i>I saw something tonight.</i>

757
01:04:00,755 --> 01:04:02,006
<i>I can't believe what I just saw.</i>

758
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:04,842
<i>Camilla...</i>

759
01:04:07,928 --> 01:04:09,263
<i>You gotta believe me!</i>

760
01:04:10,056 --> 01:04:12,224
<i>Don't let that woman
back in your house!</i>

761
01:04:36,957 --> 01:04:38,125
Ned?

762
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:46,884
Ned!

763
01:04:52,306 --> 01:04:53,891
You know you left
your door wide open?

764
01:04:59,355 --> 01:05:00,564
Ned?

765
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:19,917
Ned!

766
01:06:37,328 --> 01:06:38,662
<i>It's time, Jake.</i>

767
01:06:39,622 --> 01:06:40,623
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

768
01:06:43,959 --> 01:06:45,127
Where the hell have you been?

769
01:06:45,794 --> 01:06:46,794
Mr. Sterling.

770
01:06:47,046 --> 01:06:48,130
Where have you been?

771
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:49,839
We spent the
morning at the zoo,

772
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,091
and then we had
to wait for a bus.

773
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,134
Did Dr. Klein see him?

774
01:06:53,135 --> 01:06:55,011
No, I didn't think
it was necessary.

775
01:06:55,012 --> 01:06:56,889
I told you I wanted
Dr. Klein to see him!

776
01:06:59,517 --> 01:07:00,768
He's perfectly fine.

777
01:07:01,310 --> 01:07:02,645
He had a lovely time,
actually.

778
01:07:03,229 --> 01:07:04,812
Sure he had a lovely time,
babies always have

779
01:07:04,813 --> 01:07:06,774
a lovely time, he has a
lovely time lyin' on the rug!

780
01:07:07,733 --> 01:07:09,568
Will you please
stop shouting?

781
01:07:16,617 --> 01:07:17,868
What's going on here?

782
01:07:18,786 --> 01:07:20,829
I told Kate I didn't
think he needed a doctor.

783
01:07:21,038 --> 01:07:23,082
That's right, she did.
What's the matter?

784
01:07:29,964 --> 01:07:32,550
<i>Phil, listen to me.</i>

785
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:34,927
<i>I saw something tonight.</i>

786
01:07:37,012 --> 01:07:38,556
<i>I can't believe what I just saw.</i>

787
01:07:40,266 --> 01:07:41,267
<i>Camilla...</i>

788
01:07:43,602 --> 01:07:44,644
What does that mean?

789
01:07:44,645 --> 01:07:45,895
<i>You gotta believe me!</i>

790
01:07:45,896 --> 01:07:46,938
What's he talking about?

791
01:07:46,939 --> 01:07:47,940
I don't know.

792
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:50,693
Listen to his voice.

793
01:07:52,111 --> 01:07:53,404
He's scared to death.

794
01:07:57,199 --> 01:08:00,285
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

795
01:08:00,286 --> 01:08:02,662
I want you out of my house.

796
01:08:02,663 --> 01:08:03,705
Phil!

797
01:08:03,706 --> 01:08:04,872
I have to see to Jake.

798
01:08:04,873 --> 01:08:05,873
What's going on?

799
01:08:05,874 --> 01:08:07,042
Take your hands off my son!

800
01:08:07,793 --> 01:08:09,586
Stop!
Don't touch him like that!

801
01:08:09,587 --> 01:08:10,920
Just take him to bed.

802
01:08:10,921 --> 01:08:12,423
You know who I saw
today, Camilla?

803
01:08:13,007 --> 01:08:14,091
Molly Sheridan.

804
01:08:15,718 --> 01:08:17,344
You know Molly
Sheridan, don't you?

805
01:08:17,928 --> 01:08:19,388
No.

806
01:08:20,347 --> 01:08:22,600
You took care of the
Sheridan children, didn't you?

807
01:08:24,643 --> 01:08:27,020
You took care of Lia
Sheridan, didn't you?

808
01:08:27,021 --> 01:08:27,813
No.

809
01:08:27,814 --> 01:08:28,980
Phil, what is this?

810
01:08:28,981 --> 01:08:30,315
She took the Sheridan baby...

811
01:08:30,316 --> 01:08:31,525
How dare you!

812
01:08:32,568 --> 01:08:33,860
I made some calls today.

813
01:08:33,861 --> 01:08:35,194
Calls I should've
made a long time ago,

814
01:08:35,195 --> 01:08:36,696
but thank God
I made 'em today!

815
01:08:36,697 --> 01:08:37,989
The first was to
a Harold Freeman,

816
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:39,408
of Madison, Wisconsin.

817
01:08:40,743 --> 01:08:41,826
How is Mr. Freeman?

818
01:08:41,827 --> 01:08:43,202
I don't know how he is!

819
01:08:43,203 --> 01:08:44,788
But he's not in
Madison, Wisconsin!

820
01:08:47,458 --> 01:08:49,793
People at this number
never heard of Harold Freeman!

821
01:08:50,919 --> 01:08:53,129
I remember getting a
letter from Mrs. Freeman.

822
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:54,130
They moved.

823
01:08:54,465 --> 01:08:56,383
To Oak Park, Michigan.

824
01:08:56,842 --> 01:08:58,635
To be nearer Mrs.
Freeman's mother.

825
01:08:58,636 --> 01:08:59,595
Oh, you've got the letter?

826
01:08:59,596 --> 01:09:00,845
Yes, I may have!

827
01:09:00,846 --> 01:09:02,723
What about Dr.
Miller in Athens, Ohio?

828
01:09:04,183 --> 01:09:05,850
The number doesn't exist!

829
01:09:05,851 --> 01:09:07,769
Well, Dr. Miller must have
changed his telephone system.

830
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:10,480
The operator said this
number never existed!

831
01:09:10,481 --> 01:09:12,940
But every single number I
call, nobody's heard of you!

832
01:09:12,941 --> 01:09:15,360
I talked to the employment
agency, Guardian Angel.

833
01:09:15,361 --> 01:09:17,320
They said yes, they
have a Camilla Grandier

834
01:09:17,321 --> 01:09:18,696
registered with them,
but no, she wasn't

835
01:09:18,697 --> 01:09:19,864
recommended for this job!

836
01:09:19,865 --> 01:09:21,074
Why are you doing this?

837
01:09:21,075 --> 01:09:22,451
Let her do the talking!

838
01:09:23,494 --> 01:09:24,578
What do you say, Camilla?

839
01:09:25,496 --> 01:09:27,956
Or is it Diana?
Diana Julian?

840
01:09:29,375 --> 01:09:31,834
It's true, I wasn't
recommended by the agency.

841
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:33,086
Who are you?

842
01:09:33,087 --> 01:09:35,213
Name me one person who
can confirm who you are!

843
01:09:35,214 --> 01:09:36,839
Besides Molly Sheridan!

844
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:37,840
I heard about the job through

845
01:09:37,841 --> 01:09:39,467
a very dear, close
friend of mine.

846
01:09:39,468 --> 01:09:40,677
Who?

847
01:09:40,678 --> 01:09:41,719
She persuaded
me to come along,

848
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,096
she got my resume to you!

849
01:09:43,097 --> 01:09:44,389
Give me her name!

850
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:45,556
Give me her number!

851
01:09:45,557 --> 01:09:46,433
She's a very
good friend of mine,

852
01:09:46,434 --> 01:09:47,517
she was very kind to me!

853
01:09:47,518 --> 01:09:48,518
What was her name?

854
01:09:48,977 --> 01:09:50,354
Arlene Russell.

855
01:09:53,857 --> 01:09:55,983
That's a lie like
everything else you told us!

856
01:09:55,984 --> 01:09:57,944
Hey, I want you to come
to Molly Sheridan's house.

857
01:09:57,945 --> 01:09:58,986
I most certainly will not!

858
01:09:58,987 --> 01:10:00,446
Oh, no,
of course you won't!

859
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,656
I'm not staying in this
house a minute longer.

860
01:10:01,657 --> 01:10:02,241
Good, 'cause I
don't want you here!

861
01:10:02,241 --> 01:10:03,158
Stop it!

862
01:10:03,158 --> 01:10:04,076
Diana Julian,
or whatever the

863
01:10:04,077 --> 01:10:05,226
hell your name is,
you're fired!

864
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:09,915
Get out of my house.

865
01:10:17,089 --> 01:10:18,382
Get rid of all this stuff!

866
01:10:20,968 --> 01:10:22,177
Something's wrong with him.

867
01:10:23,637 --> 01:10:24,888
Phil, something's wrong.

868
01:10:46,452 --> 01:10:47,703
How long has
he been like this?

869
01:10:48,829 --> 01:10:50,079
About three hours.

870
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,415
He hasn't opened
his eyes at all.

871
01:10:54,835 --> 01:10:56,043
Is his breathing normal?

872
01:10:56,044 --> 01:10:58,005
- Oh yes, fine.
- Oh, thank God.

873
01:11:00,507 --> 01:11:01,842
Has he eaten anything?

874
01:11:03,093 --> 01:11:05,888
I think he last ate around
lunchtime today or something.

875
01:11:21,779 --> 01:11:23,113
Why won't he wake up?

876
01:11:25,115 --> 01:11:26,533
Several possibilities.

877
01:11:28,911 --> 01:11:30,204
One would be meningitis.

878
01:11:31,705 --> 01:11:32,705
What's that?

879
01:11:33,624 --> 01:11:35,125
Inflammation of the
lining of the brain.

880
01:11:36,877 --> 01:11:39,171
Which could be why he's
not responding to stimuli.

881
01:11:40,631 --> 01:11:42,006
How long can
he stay like this?

882
01:11:42,007 --> 01:11:45,343
Oh, not longer than
24 hours, but that's...

883
01:11:45,344 --> 01:11:46,761
That's what?

884
01:11:46,762 --> 01:11:48,806
But then what?
After 24 hours, what?

885
01:11:49,765 --> 01:11:51,558
Have you started
him on the new formula?

886
01:11:53,811 --> 01:11:55,561
I started
breastfeeding him again.

887
01:11:55,562 --> 01:11:58,315
I see.
You didn't tell me.

888
01:11:58,732 --> 01:11:59,982
You don't think
that that's what...

889
01:11:59,983 --> 01:12:01,401
No, no.
We"III

890
01:12:02,694 --> 01:12:05,823
We could run some tests with
Kate, but that's so remote.

891
01:12:07,533 --> 01:12:09,242
I'm gonna check
his glucose level.

892
01:12:09,243 --> 01:12:10,661
Just to rule out hypoglycemia.

893
01:12:11,578 --> 01:12:14,039
Then we can start looking into
neurological possibilities.

894
01:12:32,558 --> 01:12:35,102
Oh, God.
Please hear me.

895
01:12:36,186 --> 01:12:37,646
Just make my baby better.

896
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:42,025
Please.
Please help me.

897
01:12:59,543 --> 01:13:00,544
Jake?

898
01:13:06,508 --> 01:13:07,634
He's okay.

899
01:13:09,428 --> 01:13:12,097
God.
I'll find Dr. Klein.

900
01:13:12,723 --> 01:13:14,224
Oh, thank you, God.

901
01:13:25,402 --> 01:13:26,737
Camilla, what are
you doing here?

902
01:13:30,365 --> 01:13:32,242
I couldn't leave
without little Jake.

903
01:13:33,869 --> 01:13:34,912
He needs me.

904
01:13:37,539 --> 01:13:38,874
And I need him.

905
01:13:42,002 --> 01:13:43,295
Don't be afraid.

906
01:13:44,212 --> 01:13:45,588
He's not going <i>to...</i>

907
01:13:45,589 --> 01:13:47,298
He doesn't need you,
just stay away from him!

908
01:13:47,299 --> 01:13:49,300
See?
He's not...

909
01:13:49,301 --> 01:13:50,677
The doctor's coming, Camilla!

910
01:13:51,345 --> 01:13:52,803
He'll have eternal
life through me.

911
01:13:52,804 --> 01:13:53,722
Don't!

912
01:13:53,723 --> 01:13:54,764
Isn't that beautiful?

913
01:13:54,765 --> 01:13:55,840
Just leave him
alone, stop it!

914
01:13:57,225 --> 01:13:58,268
Camilla, don't!

915
01:13:59,686 --> 01:14:01,813
What are you doing,
don't move him? Phil!

916
01:14:04,066 --> 01:14:05,817
You take your
hands off my baby.

917
01:14:21,917 --> 01:14:23,126
Oh God,
hang on!

918
01:14:44,314 --> 01:14:45,731
Take him.
Do you have him?

919
01:14:45,732 --> 01:14:46,732
Yeah.

920
01:15:02,249 --> 01:15:03,750
Oh!
Oh my God.

921
01:15:07,629 --> 01:15:09,006
Get behind the fence!

922
01:15:17,347 --> 01:15:18,765
Get behind the fence!

923
01:15:21,435 --> 01:15:23,395
Let's go!
Let's go!

924
01:15:23,729 --> 01:15:25,731
It's the baby,
they just want the baby!

925
01:15:28,984 --> 01:15:31,278
I'll meet you at the
entrance to the woods!

926
01:18:38,924 --> 01:18:41,009
Phil, Phil!
Oh, honey!

927
01:18:45,055 --> 01:18:46,139
Phil!

928
01:18:51,686 --> 01:18:52,687
Look out!

929
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,745
Damn you!

930
01:19:45,448 --> 01:19:47,032
You able to get some sleep?

931
01:19:47,033 --> 01:19:48,493
No, not much.

932
01:19:48,827 --> 01:19:51,203
Sorry, the spare office is
the only one with the couch.

933
01:19:51,204 --> 01:19:52,204
It was fine.

934
01:19:53,581 --> 01:19:55,040
How's the little guy?

935
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:56,584
He's better,
he had some breakfast.

936
01:19:57,669 --> 01:19:59,838
I have a son.
Two years old.

937
01:20:00,046 --> 01:20:01,046
Yeah?

938
01:20:04,175 --> 01:20:06,803
Okay, let's start
at the beginning.

939
01:20:10,307 --> 01:20:13,851
The Guardian Angel agency
had a woman named Grandier,

940
01:20:13,852 --> 01:20:16,353
but they never sent her to you.

941
01:20:16,354 --> 01:20:18,397
She moved back to New
Orleans a few months ago.

942
01:20:18,398 --> 01:20:19,441
We knew that.

943
01:20:20,317 --> 01:20:21,817
You say your
lady was British?

944
01:20:21,818 --> 01:20:23,069
Well, that's what she said.

945
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,947
We have no record
of her at immigration.

946
01:20:26,948 --> 01:20:28,866
I told you,
her ID was fake.

947
01:20:28,867 --> 01:20:30,410
Her references were fake.

948
01:20:34,122 --> 01:20:36,374
We went back to the
woods behind your house.

949
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:38,877
I had it photographed
from top to bottom.

950
01:20:39,044 --> 01:20:40,211
You saw the tree?

951
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:42,213
- Mmm-hm.
- The babies?

952
01:20:42,797 --> 01:20:44,298
You mean the carvings?

953
01:20:44,299 --> 01:20:46,091
They're not carvings, that's,

954
01:20:46,092 --> 01:20:47,426
that's where she
took the babies!

955
01:20:47,427 --> 01:20:48,678
She takes them...

956
01:20:48,845 --> 01:20:50,216
Mr. Sterling, we
didn't find her body.

957
01:20:51,264 --> 01:20:52,765
What?

958
01:20:52,766 --> 01:20:53,974
Jeep tracks everywhere,
like you said, but...

959
01:20:53,975 --> 01:20:55,267
Of course there
were Jeep tracks!

960
01:20:55,268 --> 01:20:56,894
I hit her with the
Jeep, I ran her over,

961
01:20:56,895 --> 01:20:58,438
I hit her full force, I mean...

962
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:00,939
The Jeep must have been
going 50 miles an hour!

963
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:01,858
I know, that's...

964
01:21:01,859 --> 01:21:03,567
I killed her!
She was dead!

965
01:21:03,568 --> 01:21:05,028
I saw her.
She's dead.

966
01:21:05,987 --> 01:21:07,488
Did you feel her pulse?

967
01:21:07,489 --> 01:21:09,323
No, I didn't feel her
pulse, I'm telling you...

968
01:21:09,324 --> 01:21:11,367
I know what you're
telling me, Mr. Sterling,

969
01:21:11,368 --> 01:21:13,787
you also told me she was flying
at you through the trees.

970
01:21:14,746 --> 01:21:17,207
- I know how that sounds.
- You do?

971
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:19,584
It's the truth.

972
01:21:20,835 --> 01:21:22,212
You seem like decent people.

973
01:21:23,838 --> 01:21:25,839
But what you're
saying makes no sense.

974
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,133
I know you've had a
terrible experience,

975
01:21:28,134 --> 01:21:29,843
not sure just what,
but it's obvious...

976
01:21:29,844 --> 01:21:31,387
We're not making this up.

977
01:21:31,388 --> 01:21:32,847
I don't know what
I can do to help.

978
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:36,059
There is no body, no crime.

979
01:21:37,852 --> 01:21:40,105
Your son is okay, thank God.

980
01:21:41,272 --> 01:21:42,439
But there's no evidence that the

981
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:44,234
woman you describe ever existed.

982
01:21:46,653 --> 01:21:48,405
I suggest you go to a hotel.

983
01:21:49,239 --> 01:21:50,490
I can send a man with you.

984
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:53,617
Get some rest, and
then, if you want,

985
01:21:53,618 --> 01:21:55,244
you can talk to
the psychologist.

986
01:21:55,245 --> 01:21:56,746
That's all right.
Thank you.

987
01:21:57,330 --> 01:21:58,623
You've been really helpful.

988
01:22:03,336 --> 01:22:04,462
What are your plans?

989
01:22:06,172 --> 01:22:07,757
Go back to the house,
pack our things.

990
01:22:08,758 --> 01:22:10,135
Get the hell out of here.

991
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:11,761
Then what?

992
01:22:52,886 --> 01:22:54,845
Daddy'll be home soon, honey.

993
01:22:54,846 --> 01:22:55,930
Then we're going.

994
01:22:58,850 --> 01:23:00,643
Shh.
Shh.

995
01:23:16,242 --> 01:23:17,242
Really?

996
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:20,747
Really, is that so?

997
01:23:21,915 --> 01:23:22,916
You're kidding!

998
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:22,308
It's okay.
It's okay, honey.

999
01:24:23,226 --> 01:24:24,727
It's okay.
Shh.

1000
01:24:29,857 --> 01:24:30,942
It's okay.

1001
01:24:32,026 --> 01:24:33,278
It's okay.

1002
01:24:41,119 --> 01:24:43,620
- I need the child.
- No!

1003
01:24:43,621 --> 01:24:44,872
Before the blood changes!

1004
01:26:58,923 --> 01:27:00,133
No!

1005
01:28:24,091 --> 01:28:26,636
It's okay, honey.
You're safe now.
