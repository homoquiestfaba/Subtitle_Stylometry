00:01:54,493 --> 00:01:56,323
[Donna] Did you call for me,
honey?

3
00:01:57,427 --> 00:01:58,428
[Tessa] No, Mom.

4
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,742
Huh, you're up early, kiddo.

5
00:02:01,776 --> 00:02:03,433
What can I get you for
breakfast?

6
00:02:03,468 --> 00:02:05,366
Chocolate chip pancakes.

7
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:06,574
You got it, love bug.

8
00:02:08,058 --> 00:02:10,337
And for the tracks,
do you think I'll win.

9
00:02:10,371 --> 00:02:11,648
No, you won't.

10
00:02:11,683 --> 00:02:14,513
Because there's no finish
line, how can you win?

11
00:02:14,548 --> 00:02:16,136
You just gotta make your own.

12
00:02:18,483 --> 00:02:19,760
I win!

What's wrong?

15
00:02:35,534 --> 00:02:37,881
I had another nightmare.

16
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:41,575
Kids, get dressed. We're
leaving in 20 minutes.

17
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:42,852

camping

37
00:04:08,938 --> 00:04:10,353
on our second date?

38
00:04:10,388 --> 00:04:11,251
Hey, Dad.

39
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,425
Hey, Champ.

40
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,600
Hey, you guys wanna know what
bears

41
00:04:15,634 --> 00:04:17,843

42
00:04:17,878 --> 00:04:18,706
What?

43
00:04:20,018 --> 00:04:20,950
Soft tacos [laughs].

44
00:04:20,984 --> 00:04:21,813
Stop it.

45
00:04:24,505 --> 00:04:26,093
I don't get it.

46
00:04:26,127 --> 00:04:28,198
He means the bears are gonna
eat us.

47
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:30,339
Lucas, leave your sister alone.

48
00:04:31,512 --> 00:04:32,410
Mom!

49
00:04:33,376 --> 00:04:37,069
I wanted to hit some high
pops today, but it's raining.

50
00:04:37,104 --> 00:04:39,658
Oh, sweetie, no, the rain's
gonna clear, okay. I promise.

51
00:04:39,693 --> 00:04:40,763
Where's my hug.

Tessa, get the ball.

61
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,618
What are you, scared? Get the
ball.

62
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:10,896
No, you threw the ball. Go get
it.

63
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:13,243
Get the ball!

64
00:05:13,278 --> 00:05:14,900
[Jack] Stop being a jerk.

65

00:05:31,952 --> 00:05:33,402
Rich, how long till the burgers?

70
00:05:33,436 --> 00:05:35,542
Give me about five, hon.

71
00:05:35,576 --> 00:05:38,303
Now, Jack, it's important to
marinate

72
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,133
the ketchup with the onions.

73
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:46,173
So, the secret ingredient,
is sharp cheddar cheese.

74
00:05:46,207 --> 00:05:49,107
And you put it all on an
English muffin instead of a bun.

75
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,420
- Hey, honey?
- Yeah?

76
00:05:51,454 --> 00:05:52,731
Looks like it might storm.

77
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:54,250
We might have to head back
tonight.

78
00:05:54,284 --> 00:05:56,114
No, I think we'll be all right.

79
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:56,942
Think so?

[soft suspenseful music]

81
00:06:03,052 --> 00:06:04,122

- What?

82
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:07,436
Look, someone's watching us.

83
00:06:10,059 --> 00:06:10,887
Hey.

84
00:06:11,957 --> 00:06:12,786
Hello.

85
00:06:14,753 --> 00:06:16,962

Who was that?

89
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:36,706
It was just someone lost.
Nothing to worry about.

Where's Tessa? Tessa?

94
00:06:54,517 --> 00:06:55,898
Tessa.

95
00:06:55,932 --> 00:06:57,486
Hey, Tessa!

00:07:01,835 --> 00:07:03,595

Oh, hi.

105
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,477
What's your name?

106
00:07:25,065 --> 00:07:25,893
Out.

107
00:07:27,032 --> 00:07:28,517
My name's Tessa.

108
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,072
I just need to get my ball.

109
00:07:32,106 --> 00:07:33,176

You boys stay here, okay,
don't move!

118
00:08:07,245 --> 00:08:08,039
Okay.

119

Just about.

130
00:09:25,634 --> 00:09:27,843
Huh, it's a shame you
never had a chance to work

131
00:09:27,877 --> 00:09:29,672
those old film projection
platters.

132
00:09:29,707 --> 00:09:32,295
They spin round and round,
and you had to know exactly

133
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,126
when to switch the next
platter from a little pop

134
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,853
in the corner of the screen in
between.

135
00:09:37,887 --> 00:09:40,856
It was a beautiful bit of
business when you got it right.

136
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,479
Now you got buttons you push on
and off.

137
00:09:43,513 --> 00:09:45,170
There's no human element
anymore.

138
00:09:46,724 --> 00:09:49,278
Are you sure you haven't
reconsidered selling this place?

139
00:09:49,312 --> 00:09:53,558
Na, it's done. This place
is a relic now anyway.

[Woman On TV] Asked me if I'm
on drugs.

143
00:10:25,694 --> 00:10:27,385
I said, it's none of your
business.

144
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:31,941
Then I [speaks indistinctly].

Hey, Mom, I got dinner.

154
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,608
Chicken that you like.

155
00:11:18,643 --> 00:11:19,989
Fried?

156
00:11:20,024 --> 00:11:20,852
Grilled.

00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:24,304
Lucas.

159
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,238
I told you, I brought dinner.

160
00:11:29,205 --> 00:11:29,965
Lucas.

161
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:33,451
[soft suspenseful music]

162
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:51,849

[soft suspenseful music]

164
00:12:13,802 --> 00:12:16,736
Lucas. Lucas, where are you?

165
00:12:22,914 --> 00:12:24,882
What the hell are you doing?

166
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,746
You still haven't fixed that?

167
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,299
No, I will, all right?

168
00:12:29,403 --> 00:12:30,646
It's been six months.

169
00:12:31,854 --> 00:12:33,649
How have you not done
this? What else do you do?

170
00:12:33,683 --> 00:12:34,788
I said I'll fix it.

171
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,068
Oh, I bought you dinner.

172
00:12:39,103 --> 00:12:40,069
I'm not hungry.

173
00:12:40,104 --> 00:12:42,140
I know. I saw the mess
you left on the counter.

174
00:12:43,141 --> 00:12:45,074
You know what tomorrow is,
right?

175
00:12:45,109 --> 00:12:46,386
Yes.

176
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,768
It means a lot to Mom.

177
00:12:50,045 --> 00:12:51,080
And Zoey'll be there?

178
00:12:53,393 --> 00:12:54,221
Your daughter.

179
00:12:59,502 --> 00:13:02,436
[school bell ringing]

180
00:13:02,471 --> 00:13:04,059
So there are a lotta different
species

181
00:13:04,093 --> 00:13:04,922
that have parasites.

182
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:08,166
You have humans, animals, plant
life,

183
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:09,167
you know, those sorta things.

184
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:12,101
Right, but why doesn't
it just kill the host?

185
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:13,896
Well, the relationship between
the two

186
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:16,243
is a version of symbiosis.

187
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:18,728
I mean, in some ways, both

00:22:17,957 --> 00:22:20,477
You don't have to sleep
on the couch anymore.

370
00:22:20,511 --> 00:22:21,616
Really?

371
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,928
It's Tessa's old room actually.

372
00:22:23,963 --> 00:22:25,447
I helped Grandma clean it out.

373
00:22:26,414 --> 00:22:27,380
Do you want some?

374
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:32,247
Thank you, Princess.

375
00:22:32,281 --> 00:22:34,698
[soft music]

376
00:22:47,055 --> 00:22:48,297
This is for you.

377
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,093
That was Tessa's.

378
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:54,511
I think you should have it.

379
00:22:54,545 --> 00:22:56,133
Thank you.

380
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:57,652
It's pretty.

381
00:22:57,686 --> 00:23:00,586
[Lucas chuckling]

382
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:03,312
[both laughing]

383
00:23:04,762 --> 00:23:05,556
I love you.

384
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,041
You know that, right?

385
00:23:08,076 --> 00:23:09,871
I love you too, Dad.

386
00:23:09,905 --> 00:23:13,530
[soft piano music]

387
00:23:13,564 --> 00:23:16,809
[train whistle blowing]

388
00:23:16,843 --> 00:23:20,019
[train bells ringing]

389
00:23:21,469 --> 00:23:22,573
Demonstration.

390
00:23:22,608 --> 00:23:24,610
You are gonna be red. I'm gonna
be black.

391
00:23:24,644 --> 00:23:27,302
So if I roll the die, I get a
two.

392
00:23:27,336 --> 00:23:28,855
So, basically...

393
00:23:30,236 --> 00:23:32,963
[dramatic music]

394
00:23:41,281 --> 00:23:42,490
[water running]

395
00:23:42,524 --> 00:23:45,009
[Tessa screaming]

396
00:23:45,044 --> 00:23:48,047
[suspenseful music]

397
00:23:54,363 --> 00:23:56,814
[Donna vomiting]

398
00:23:56,849 --> 00:23:58,920
Your opponent across from you.

399
00:23:58,954 --> 00:23:59,783
Mom?

400
00:24:00,956 --> 00:24:01,785
You okay?

401
00:24:02,648 --> 00:24:03,959
[Donna groaning]

402
00:24:03,994 --> 00:24:06,099
Yeah, it's just your brother.

403
00:24:06,928 --> 00:24:08,516
He ruins everything.

404
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,760
[Donna groaning]

405
00:24:11,795 --> 00:24:13,693
How many years are we gonna do
this?

406
00:24:15,212 --> 00:24:16,489
We've searched everywhere.

407
00:24:17,421 --> 00:24:19,078
So have the police.

408
00:24:20,113 --> 00:24:21,598
We've hired private
investigators.

409
00:24:21,632 --> 00:24:23,772
We've spent money we don't have.

410
00:24:24,773 --> 00:24:26,292
We've exhausted everything.

411
00:24:28,052 --> 00:24:29,295
It's time we move on.

412
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:32,954
We all know what happened out
there, Mom.

413
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:36,889
And you're the only one
who hasn't accepted it.

414
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:40,962
[soft music]

415
00:24:40,996 --> 00:24:43,654
You don't understand the truth.

416
00:24:43,689 --> 00:24:46,692
[suspenseful music]

417
00:24:48,314 --> 00:24:50,868

[dramatic music]

422
00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:29,666
It was your fault!

423
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:31,633
No.

424
00:25:31,668 --> 00:25:33,773
Now, it wants you.

425
00:25:33,808 --> 00:25:34,636
Go away!

426
00:25:35,913 --> 00:25:37,915
[Tessa] Lucas, please!

427
00:25:39,883 --> 00:25:42,886
[voices whispering]

428
00:25:48,374 --> 00:25:51,204
[Tessa screaming]

429
00:25:52,792 --> 00:25:54,138
Open the door!

430
00:25:55,381 --> 00:25:57,659
Lucas, what are you doing to
her!

431
00:25:57,694 --> 00:26:00,559
I hate you! I'm telling Mom
and Dad!

432
00:26:00,593 --> 00:26:03,492
[whispers echoing]

433
00:26:12,122 --> 00:26:15,677

434
00:26:15,712 --> 00:26:17,610
[banging on door]

435
00:26:17,645 --> 00:26:20,164
[Tessa] It's okay, Lucas, come
in.

436
00:26:20,199 --> 00:26:22,857
[heart beating]

437
00:26:28,483 --> 00:26:31,279
[thunder rolling]

438
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:36,387
[suspenseful music]

439
00:26:45,914 --> 00:26:48,434
Tessa, is that, is that you?

440
00:26:51,644 --> 00:26:52,680
I'm so sorry.

441
00:26:55,441 --> 00:26:56,511
I'm so sorry.

442
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:00,895
I've been waiting for you,
Lucas.

443
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:05,934
Do you want to hit some
high pops [laughs]?

444
00:27:06,521 --> 00:27:09,144
[laughter echoing]

445
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:12,182
[suspenseful music]

[dramatic crescendo]

447
00:27:25,747 --> 00:27:27,197
It wasn't my fault!

448
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:29,889
It wasn't my fault!

449
00:27:29,924 --> 00:27:32,651
[dramatic music]

450
00:27:50,427 --> 00:27:51,980
It wasn't my fault!

451

[gun firing]

452
00:27:56,019 --> 00:27:59,022
[suspenseful music]

453
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:11,828
Lucas.

454
00:28:12,863 --> 00:28:14,037
Lucas!

455
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:14,900
Lucas!

456
00:28:15,763 --> 00:28:18,938
[soft dramatic music]

457
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,189
Thank you so much for being
here today,

458
00:28:29,086 --> 00:28:32,918
so that we may share in
the life of Lucas Coyle.

459
00:28:32,952 --> 00:28:35,679
Whenever I'm called upon to
speak at a time like this,

460
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:40,649
I'm often directed to the words
of Moses,

461
00:28:40,684 --> 00:28:43,342
specifically, Psalm 90.

462
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:47,726
Teach us to number our days

463
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,556
that we may gain a heart of
wisdom.

464
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:53,801
[soft mournful music]

465
00:28:53,835 --> 00:28:56,873
Teach us to number our days

466
00:28:56,907 --> 00:28:58,875
so that we may gain a heart of
wisdom.

467
00:29:00,946 --> 00:29:02,879
[Mourner] I'm so sorry
for your loss, Jack.

468
00:29:02,913 --> 00:29:04,570
If there's anything you need,
let me know.

469
00:29:04,604 --> 00:29:05,778
Are you thirsty?

470
00:29:05,813 --> 00:29:08,954
[soft mournful music]

471
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:12,681
You look like your father in
that suit.

472
00:29:16,893 --> 00:29:18,964
I don't wanna do this.

473
00:29:18,998 --> 00:29:22,381
All these people, looking
at me, judging me,

474
00:29:22,415 --> 00:29:27,075
like what kinda mother would
let her son get to that point?

475
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,180
No one thinks that.

476
00:29:30,596 --> 00:29:32,011
I wanna spread his ashes.

477
00:29:36,498 --> 00:29:37,879
What's he doing here?

478
00:29:37,914 --> 00:29:39,950
Just say hi, Mom.

479
00:29:39,985 --> 00:29:40,951
I'm gonna go wait in the car.

480
00:29:40,986 --> 00:29:43,160
We need to wait till
everyone leaves, Mom.

481
00:29:44,506 --> 00:29:46,405
[soft mournful music]

482
00:29:46,439 --> 00:29:47,682
Jack.

483
00:29:47,716 --> 00:29:49,132
Really happy you came.

484
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:50,685
Lucas meant the world to me.

485
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:53,412
I know.

486
00:29:53,446 --> 00:29:54,689
Did you know that we've been
talking

487
00:29:54,723 --> 00:29:56,656
the last couple months?

488
00:29:56,691 --> 00:29:57,519
Really?

489
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:00,729
It was a big step for him to
reach out.

490
00:30:00,764 --> 00:30:02,870
I thought he was finally getting
it.

491
00:30:02,904 --> 00:30:04,457
Even came to a few meetings.

492
00:30:06,218 --> 00:30:07,253
I didn't know that.

493
00:30:08,772 --> 00:30:10,532
Listen, when you're ready to
talk,

494
00:30:11,499 --> 00:30:13,328
you know where to find me.

495
00:30:13,363 --> 00:30:14,743
I will. Thank you.

496
00:30:14,778 --> 00:30:15,572
I love you, Jack.

497
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:16,435
Love you too.

498
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,611
[Rory] Has the family had time
to say

499
00:30:20,646 --> 00:30:22,061
their final farewells?

500
00:30:24,063 --> 00:30:25,582
Yeah, okay.

501
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:28,550
[whispers echoing]

502
00:30:29,897 --> 00:30:33,314
[soft suspenseful music]

503
00:30:55,094 --> 00:30:56,820
[Zoey screaming]

504
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:57,683
Zoey!

505
00:30:58,615 --> 00:30:59,996
What's wrong? Are you okay?

506
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:00,928
Zoey, honey, are you...

507
00:31:00,962 --> 00:31:03,862
There's something in there
with Daddy!

508
00:31:03,896 --> 00:31:06,140
[soft suspenseful music]

509
00:31:06,174 --> 00:31:07,693
Uncle Jack, please don't!

510
00:31:07,727 --> 00:31:11,110
[soft suspenseful music]

511
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:21,603
It was nothing, Zoey. It's
okay.

512
00:31:21,638 --> 00:31:24,192
We're here for you, sweetie.
Okay?

513
00:31:24,227 --> 00:31:26,436
Here, come here, baby, sh.

514
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,887
[soft music]

515
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,235
Say hi to your mama.

516
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:35,617
[soft music]

517
00:31:38,344 --> 00:31:39,173
How did he look?

518
00:31:40,243 --> 00:31:41,520
You could have come in.

519
00:31:41,554 --> 00:31:43,280
Don't do too well at these
things.

520
00:31:43,315 --> 00:31:45,800
Sometimes you have to do
things you don't wanna do.

521
00:31:45,834 --> 00:31:46,939
I know, I know.

522
00:31:48,009 --> 00:31:49,528
Hey, baby.

523
00:31:49,562 --> 00:31:51,185
Look, I'm sorry I'm late.

524
00:31:51,219 --> 00:31:54,395
I had to stop somewhere because
I wanted to get you this.

525
00:31:55,258 --> 00:31:56,949
[soft piano music]

526
00:31:56,984 --> 00:31:59,055
Hey, Steff, let's bounce.

527
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:00,263
Let's go.

528
00:32:00,297 --> 00:32:01,195
Give us a second.

529
00:32:01,229 --> 00:32:02,990
So sorry about your brother,
man.

530
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:04,819
No, not you.

531
00:32:06,579 --> 00:32:07,649
Jack, can you, um?

532
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,344
I'm obviously going through a
really rough time right now,

533
00:32:13,379 --> 00:32:14,208
and can Zoey...

534
00:32:17,763 --> 00:32:18,902
I need you to take her.

535
00:32:20,076 --> 00:32:21,940
You're seriously leaving right
now?

536
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:25,253
I'm sorry [breathes unsteadily].

537
00:32:27,911 --> 00:32:28,739
Bye, sweetie pie.

538
00:32:29,706 --> 00:32:31,397
Where are you going?

539
00:32:31,432 --> 00:32:33,779
Stay with your Uncle
Jack for a smidge, okay.

540
00:32:35,091 --> 00:32:37,093
You know how your mom gets.

541
00:32:37,127 --> 00:32:39,992
[soft music]

542
00:32:40,027 --> 00:32:41,752
Hey, let's go to Grandma, okay?

543
00:32:41,787 --> 00:32:43,789
I'm gonna take you to the car.

544
00:32:43,823 --> 00:32:44,617
Okay.

545
00:32:44,652 --> 00:32:45,480
All right, let's go.

546
00:32:49,346 --> 00:32:51,693
Hey, you think you can
help me out a little?

547
00:32:51,728 --> 00:32:53,385
Anybody leave any money
in those cards in there?

548
00:32:53,419 --> 00:32:56,008
Yeah, they did, but it's for
Zoey.

549
00:32:56,043 --> 00:32:57,527
I just wanted to have
a few friends over,

550
00:32:57,561 --> 00:33:00,254
you know, for a little
thing to celebrate Luke.

551
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:01,841
Think you could chip in for it?

552
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:04,810
I'm done.

553
00:33:07,468 --> 00:33:08,296
Okay.

554
00:33:10,195 --> 00:33:13,819
Never mind.

555
00:33:13,853 --> 00:33:15,027
How much you get?

556
00:33:15,062 --> 00:33:16,097
[Steffi] Nothing.

557
00:33:16,132 --> 00:33:17,064
Nothing?

558
00:33:17,098 --> 00:33:18,962
Just leave me alone.

559
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:22,379
[soft suspenseful music]

560
00:33:33,183 --> 00:33:36,531
[footsteps approaching]

561
00:33:37,394 --> 00:33:39,810
[soft music]

562
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:47,059
What are you doing?

563
00:33:48,405 --> 00:33:49,475
I miss him.

564
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,825
I miss him too.

565
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:57,725
You know, when we were kids,

566
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:00,141
Tessa was afraid to put
her hands in the cement.

567
00:34:01,798 --> 00:34:03,282
So your dad did it first.

568
00:34:05,077 --> 00:34:06,527
He was brave, just like you.

569
00:34:10,703 --> 00:34:12,015
Someone's here.

570
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,776
[dryer rattling]

571
00:34:18,608 --> 00:34:19,988
[Whispering Voice] Mommy.

572
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,925
Do you ever hear voices?

573
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,170
What kind of voices?

574
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:33,692
I mean voices that aren't
really there.

575
00:34:35,487 --> 00:34:36,729
Do you?

576
00:34:36,764 --> 00:34:40,388
Could it be the thing
that's buried in the basement?

577
00:34:40,423 --> 00:34:41,493
Who told you that?

578
00:34:42,735 --> 00:34:45,083
I heard you and my
dad talk about it once.

579
00:34:48,948 --> 00:34:51,019
What if he's trying to tell me
something?

580
00:34:52,435 --> 00:34:53,332
Come here.

581
00:34:53,367 --> 00:34:55,783
[soft music]

582
00:34:57,233 --> 00:35:00,063
[Zoey crying]

583
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,515
[soft suspenseful music]

584
00:35:21,153 --> 00:35:23,535
Hey.

585
00:35:23,569 --> 00:35:25,399
Hey, Jack. Glad you came.

586
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:29,506
How you holding up?

587
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,926
To be honest, not good.

588
00:35:37,342 --> 00:35:38,722
To be honest, that's natural.

589
00:35:38,757 --> 00:35:40,586
You're not supposed to feel
good, Jack.

590
00:35:41,691 --> 00:35:42,692
Place looks great.

591
00:35:43,831 --> 00:35:46,282
Yeah. A Heritage Museum.

592
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,458
Honor the past, just don't live
in it.

593
00:35:53,875 --> 00:35:55,153
What's on your mind, Jack?

594
00:35:58,225 --> 00:36:00,365
What did you and Lucas talk
about

595
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:01,711
the last time you saw him?

596
00:36:03,816 --> 00:36:04,645
He was using.

597
00:36:06,992 --> 00:36:09,063
He wanted to get better for
Zoey.

598
00:36:09,097 --> 00:36:10,237
He knew she needed him,

599
00:36:11,272 --> 00:36:13,205
but his demons were still too
strong.

600
00:36:14,517 --> 00:36:15,414
How's your mother?

601
00:36:16,243 --> 00:36:17,727
The same.

602
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:20,247
They have her on four
different meds right now.

603
00:36:20,281 --> 00:36:21,869
I know they're making her
physically sick,

604
00:36:21,903 --> 00:36:23,698
and none of them seem to be
helping.

605
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:27,461
I hate your mother's doctors.

606
00:36:27,495 --> 00:36:28,669
It helped at first.

607
00:36:28,703 --> 00:36:30,188
You really think so?

608
00:36:30,222 --> 00:36:31,085
I don't know.

609
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,294
Your mother is addicted to her
meds.

610
00:36:34,364 --> 00:36:36,090
She's my sister.

611
00:36:36,124 --> 00:36:37,781
I knew her before all this
happened,

612
00:36:37,816 --> 00:36:40,750
and I've seen the wonderful
person inside.

613
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:41,613
I know.

614
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:44,547
She won't change.

615
00:36:44,581 --> 00:36:45,548
But she can.

616
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,723
It happens. People do it all the
time.

617
00:36:48,758 --> 00:36:50,208
But she chooses not to.

618
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:53,314
She replays that day over and
over again.

619
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:54,591
She just won't accept

620
00:36:55,834 --> 00:36:58,250
that Tessa and your father are
gone.

621
00:37:00,321 --> 00:37:02,703
And with Lucas gone, I'm
afraid she's gonna drift

622
00:37:02,737 --> 00:37:05,153
deeper and deeper until
there's no reaching her.

623
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:09,917
Jack, don't fall into your own
loop.

624
00:37:10,745 --> 00:37:12,230
That would be a real tragedy.

625
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,337
- Thanks.
- Yeah, whew.

626
00:37:18,063 --> 00:37:20,928
So, how's Zoey doing?

627
00:37:20,962 --> 00:37:22,032
She's gonna stay with us for a
while

628
00:37:22,067 --> 00:37:23,862
until Steffi gets her shit
together.

629
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,624
I can't imagine what that
little girl is going through.

630
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:29,488
I wanna give her some sense of
normalcy,

631
00:37:29,523 --> 00:37:31,145
something Lucas and I never had.

632
00:37:32,767 --> 00:37:34,390
She just needs some guidance.

633
00:37:36,288 --> 00:37:38,186
That's all any of us are looking
for.

634
00:37:41,466 --> 00:37:43,606
We're gonna spread
Lucas' ashes tomorrow.

635
00:37:46,712 --> 00:37:48,921
It would mean a lot to
me if you were there.

636
00:37:50,854 --> 00:37:52,718
Then I will be there.

637
00:37:52,753 --> 00:37:55,169
[soft music]

638
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,275
- Bye.
- Bye.

639
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:05,317
[soft suspenseful music]

640
00:38:08,182 --> 00:38:10,943

641

[soft piano music]

643
00:38:31,757 --> 00:38:33,034
You all right?

644
00:38:33,069 --> 00:38:36,452
[soft suspenseful music]

645
00:38:46,703 --> 00:38:48,912

[water flowing]

648
00:39:02,098 --> 00:39:04,445
Are you sure this is the right
place?

649
00:39:05,308 --> 00:39:06,274
Absolutely.

650
00:39:09,277 --> 00:39:11,072
Do you wanna say something?

651
00:39:11,107 --> 00:39:13,523
[soft music]

652
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:19,011
Lucas, I just want you to
know that I love you, and uh,

653
00:39:22,774 --> 00:39:23,602
I'm sorry.

654
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,469
Do you have the urn, sweetie?

655
00:39:28,504 --> 00:39:31,645
[soft mournful music]

656
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:38,410
Where is it? Where's the urn?

657
00:39:38,445 --> 00:39:41,033
I don't know. You guys had it.

658
00:39:41,068 --> 00:39:42,414
[Zoey] I thought you had it.

659
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:45,175
I didn't have it. I thought
you held onto it, sweetie.

660
00:39:46,453 --> 00:39:47,350
[Jack sighing]

661
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,972
All right, come on.

662
00:39:51,596 --> 00:39:53,391
[Donna] You lost it, Jack.

663
00:39:55,876 --> 00:39:57,740
How could I have misplaced this?

664
00:39:57,774 --> 00:39:59,189
How could it just disappear?

665
00:39:59,224 --> 00:40:00,605
Maybe somebody took it.

666
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:03,055
I don't know.

667
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:05,092
Mom, please, if you see it, let
me know.

668
00:40:05,126 --> 00:40:06,265
I'm gonna go check in the car.

669
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,820
All right, I'll come with
you. We'll be back, okay?

00:40:09,821 --> 00:40:12,271

[fire crackling]

672
00:40:13,721 --> 00:40:16,172
Did Tessa really disappear out
here?

673
00:40:17,311 --> 00:40:18,139
She did.

674
00:40:19,796 --> 00:40:21,453
How do you know?

675
00:40:21,488 --> 00:40:24,145
Well, we couldn't find her.

676
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,008
We just

677
00:40:26,769 --> 00:40:27,839
lost her.

678
00:40:27,873 --> 00:40:30,635
[fire crackling]

679
00:40:32,775 --> 00:40:34,915
Do you really think
she's still out here?

680
00:40:36,364 --> 00:40:37,193
I do.

681
00:40:39,195 --> 00:40:41,300
Why didn't you continue
looking for her?

682
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:49,205
Zoey, do you wanna go
look for Tessa with me?

683
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:54,106
[dramatic crescendo]

684
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,661
Where did they go?

685
00:40:58,973 --> 00:41:00,285
[Donna] Tessa!

686
00:41:01,666 --> 00:41:03,495
[Zoey] Tessa!

687
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:04,841
- Tessa!
- Tessa!

688
00:41:08,189 --> 00:41:11,158
Tessa, where are you?

689
00:41:11,192 --> 00:41:12,021
Tessa!

690
00:41:13,919 --> 00:41:14,748

692
00:41:21,927 --> 00:41:23,722

[Donna groaning]

694
00:41:28,244 --> 00:41:29,694
My Grandma's hurt!

695
00:41:30,626 --> 00:41:31,972
Can you help me?

00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:35,769
[soft suspenseful music]

697
00:41:35,803 --> 00:41:38,530
I'm gonna get help. Please be
okay.

Zoey!

702
00:41:54,373 --> 00:41:55,202
Mom!

703
00:41:56,686 --> 00:41:58,308
Zoey!

704
00:41:58,343 --> 00:41:59,378
She's not here.

705
00:42:01,691 --> 00:42:02,934
Go back to the car.

706
00:42:02,968 --> 00:42:05,833
There's a gun in the trunk,
under the spare tire.

707
00:42:05,868 --> 00:42:07,525
Jack, you're scaring me.

708
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:09,596
This isn't gonna happen again.

709
00:42:10,631 --> 00:42:12,806
Okay, all right.

710
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,669
Mom!

711
00:42:14,946 --> 00:42:15,774

00:42:27,821 --> 00:42:28,649

Mom? Mom, wake up.

719
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,059
Are you okay?

720
00:42:59,093 --> 00:43:00,405
Where is Zoey?

721
00:43:02,649 --> 00:43:03,511
Mom!

[phone dialing]

723
00:43:08,931 --> 00:43:10,070
[Operator] 911, what's your
emergency?

724
00:43:10,104 --> 00:43:12,210
My mom has collapsed.

725
00:43:12,244 --> 00:43:14,419
She's breathing but
otherwise unresponsive.

Zoey? Zoey?

735
00:44:01,328 --> 00:44:02,432
Who are you calling?

okay?

00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,138
What is this?

739
00:44:18,172 --> 00:44:19,035
What are you doing here, Zoey?

740
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:20,416
Grandma fell to the ground.

741
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,176
This nice lady is calling for
help.

742
00:44:23,212 --> 00:44:24,903
[woman speaking unintelligibly]

743
00:44:24,938 --> 00:44:26,594
Hang up the phone.

744
00:44:26,629 --> 00:44:30,012
[soft suspenseful music]

745
00:44:46,718 --> 00:44:47,995
Where did you get this?

746
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:49,997
You need, yours.

747
00:44:50,929 --> 00:44:53,173
Zoey, let's go. Come on, let's
go.

748
00:44:54,036 --> 00:44:57,660
[soft suspenseful music]

749
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,835
You were there that day,
weren't you?

750
00:45:00,732 --> 00:45:02,665
[soft suspenseful music]

751
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,253
[tea kettle whistling]

752
00:45:04,287 --> 00:45:08,740
Stay away from me, and
stay away from my family!

753
00:45:08,775 --> 00:45:11,467
[bat clattering]

754
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:14,884

[dramatic music]

757
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:32,039
[Nix growling]

758
00:45:33,834 --> 00:45:35,180
What is that, Uncle Jack?

759
00:45:39,598 --> 00:45:40,772
Go to the car.

760
00:45:40,807 --> 00:45:43,223
Liz is at the car. Lock the
doors.

761
00:45:43,257 --> 00:45:45,501
Okay, lock the doors. Go!

762
00:45:52,128 --> 00:45:54,337
[dramatic crescendo]

763
00:45:54,372 --> 00:45:55,442
Liz, something's out there.

764
00:45:55,476 --> 00:45:57,755
Zoey, get in the car.

765
00:45:57,789 --> 00:46:01,241
Lock the door. Don't
open it until I get back!

766
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:04,037
[dramatic music]

767
00:46:07,316 --> 00:46:09,663
[gun firing]

768
00:46:09,697 --> 00:46:11,078
What the hell was that?

769
00:46:14,047 --> 00:46:16,670
[wind blowing]

770
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,298
[Jack exhaling]

[door closing]

772
00:46:31,271 --> 00:46:32,928
Is Grandma gonna be okay?

773
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:36,794
She will, I promise. Don't
worry.

774
00:46:38,968 --> 00:46:40,625
What attacked us, Uncle Jack?

775
00:46:44,284 --> 00:46:45,078
I don't know. I...

776
00:46:45,112 --> 00:46:46,942
Is it gonna come after us again?

777
00:46:46,976 --> 00:46:47,805
No, it won't.

778
00:46:49,254 --> 00:46:50,083
I shot it.

779
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,224
So, it won't get us?

780
00:46:53,258 --> 00:46:54,087
No.

781
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:57,815
It's gonna be okay, all right?

782
00:46:59,471 --> 00:47:00,300
Okay.

783
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:05,650
Mr. Coyle?

784
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:08,687
Mr. Coyle?

785
00:47:13,589 --> 00:47:14,728
How's she doing?

786
00:47:14,762 --> 00:47:16,247
She's doing better. She was
dehydrated.

787
00:47:16,281 --> 00:47:19,215
That's part of the reason
why she lost consciousness.

788
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,665
What's really going on?

789
00:47:20,699 --> 00:47:22,563
When was the last time she saw
a doctor?

790
00:47:22,598 --> 00:47:23,599
It was like two years ago.

791
00:47:23,633 --> 00:47:25,463
She doesn't like going to the
doctor's.

792
00:47:25,497 --> 00:47:27,879
Well that's unfortunate,
because her blood pressure's

793
00:47:27,914 --> 00:47:30,709
really low, and there are some
vitals

794
00:47:30,744 --> 00:47:32,263
of hers that are concerning me.

795
00:47:33,678 --> 00:47:35,231
I don't wanna jump to any
conclusions,

796
00:47:35,266 --> 00:47:37,509
and it's hard to tell,
but she should really

797
00:47:37,544 --> 00:47:38,890
go see her primary doctor.

798
00:47:41,203 --> 00:47:41,997
Okay.

799
00:47:42,031 --> 00:47:45,448
[soft suspenseful music]

800
00:47:46,553 --> 00:47:47,934
[gulls calling]

801
00:47:47,968 --> 00:47:49,625
[Jack] We went out
to spread Lucas' ashes,

802
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:52,870
and my mom collapsed out in the
woods.

803
00:47:54,009 --> 00:47:55,355
We almost lost her.

804
00:47:55,389 --> 00:47:57,115
And what'd the doctor say?

805
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:58,565
It's what they didn't say.

806
00:48:00,567 --> 00:48:02,327
What aren't you telling me,
Jack?

807
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:05,952
Something was out there.

808
00:48:06,918 --> 00:48:07,919
What do you mean something?

809
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:10,508
I'm not sure.

810
00:48:13,856 --> 00:48:15,306
I know this may sound weird.

811
00:48:18,102 --> 00:48:18,965
It wasn't human.

812
00:48:20,138 --> 00:48:23,141
[soft suspenseful music]

813
00:48:23,176 --> 00:48:26,420
[Idres groaning]

814
00:48:26,455 --> 00:48:30,735
I think people create
monsters, real or imagined.

815
00:48:31,632 --> 00:48:34,497
But you know, I looked
in the mirror one day,

816
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,948
and I didn't like what I saw.

817
00:48:36,983 --> 00:48:39,295
And I realized if I didn't get
sober,

818
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:40,538
it was gonna consume me.

819
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:43,851
How'd you get through it?

820
00:48:45,992 --> 00:48:48,615
Okay, so,

821
00:48:48,649 --> 00:48:50,272
there are these two bull moose,

822
00:48:50,306 --> 00:48:52,619
and their territories overlap.

823
00:48:52,653 --> 00:48:54,241
And they confronted each other
one day,

824
00:48:54,276 --> 00:48:56,312
and they started banging
heads, their thick skulls,

825
00:48:56,347 --> 00:48:58,936
boom, boom, over and over again.

826
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:00,558
And then one of them hooked the
other's

827
00:49:00,592 --> 00:49:02,318
antlers and broke its neck.

828
00:49:03,492 --> 00:49:06,874
But now, it has to drag
that carcass around

829
00:49:07,841 --> 00:49:09,705
until it's exhausted and dies.

830
00:49:11,534 --> 00:49:12,708
I don't get it.

831
00:49:13,847 --> 00:49:15,607
People choose their burdens.

832
00:49:17,161 --> 00:49:19,957
And a person must choose
to put that burden down

833
00:49:19,991 --> 00:49:21,268
before they can be free.

834
00:49:25,031 --> 00:49:25,859
You get it?

835
00:49:27,654 --> 00:49:28,482
Yeah.

836
00:49:30,795 --> 00:49:31,589
Good.

How's my little girl doing?

Mom?

850
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:08,272
I need your help, Zoey.

851
00:51:11,344 --> 00:51:13,553
Would you be a dear and
tighten this for me?

853
00:51:23,632 --> 00:51:24,978
Don't be afraid.

854
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,430
It's nothing.

855
00:51:30,052 --> 00:51:31,536
I don't want to.

856
00:51:33,366 --> 00:51:35,195
I need you to do it.

857
00:51:36,403 --> 00:51:37,197
No!

858
00:51:37,232 --> 00:51:38,474

[Jack] Zoey, what's wrong?

864
00:52:11,093 --> 00:52:13,544
My mom was here, and then it
took her!

865
00:52:13,578 --> 00:52:14,545
Who took her?

866
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:16,616
The monster from the woods.

Can you check on my mom
tomorrow?

870
00:53:01,902 --> 00:53:02,972
I'm worried about her,

871
00:53:03,007 --> 00:53:05,182
and I wanna make sure she's
okay.

872
00:53:05,216 --> 00:53:06,217
Sure.

00:53:09,565 --> 00:53:12,361
Can you sleep on the chair
and watch over me tonight?

875
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:15,468
Of course.

876
00:53:19,023 --> 00:53:20,990
I won't let anything bad happen
to you.

877
00:53:22,682 --> 00:53:24,753
I love you, Uncle Jack.

878
00:53:24,787 --> 00:53:26,513

Steffi.

885
00:54:41,243 --> 00:54:42,175
Is she okay?

886
00:54:46,386 --> 00:54:47,249
She's dead.

887
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,322
I'm so sorry.

888
00:54:51,357 --> 00:54:53,980
What am I gonna tell Zoey?
This isn't fair to her.

889
00:54:55,188 --> 00:54:57,535
You have to be there for
her, whatever she needs.

890
00:54:57,570 --> 00:55:00,297
She just lost her father.
I can't tell her right away.

891
00:55:01,746 --> 00:55:04,231
I mean, things just aren't
making sense lately.

892
00:55:05,405 --> 00:55:07,718
I just got Lucas' toxicology
report back.

893
00:55:09,961 --> 00:55:12,239
I thought he might a had
drugs in his system.

894
00:55:12,274 --> 00:55:14,932
I didn't see anything on
here, except his medication.

895
00:55:14,966 --> 00:55:16,105
I wanna know if I'm missing
something.

896
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,141
Please take a look.

897
00:55:18,073 --> 00:55:20,420
Okay, um.

I don't, I don't see anything.

00:55:25,667 --> 00:55:26,495
What is this right here?

901
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:28,808
Phage lytic enzymes.

902
00:55:31,051 --> 00:55:33,537
I believe that he took his life

903
00:55:33,571 --> 00:55:35,055
because of something deeper.

904
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,093
No, there's something else.

905
00:55:38,127 --> 00:55:42,097
This was in Lucas' room.

What am I looking at?

908
00:55:50,036 --> 00:55:53,280
It's what I saw that
night. It's what attacked us.

909
00:55:53,315 --> 00:55:55,662
And look, this is Lucas'
handwriting.

910
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:59,079
It's the word he wrote in the
mirror

911
00:55:59,114 --> 00:56:00,771
before he took his life.

912
00:56:03,843 --> 00:56:05,223
What if this thing is Nix?

913
00:56:06,949 --> 00:56:08,882
Do you know what nix means in
German?

914
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,749
Nothing. It means nothing.

915
00:56:14,992 --> 00:56:17,166
You were out there that night.

916
00:56:17,201 --> 00:56:19,583
That was no animal, okay.

917
00:56:20,446 --> 00:56:21,412
This isn't nothing.

918
00:56:22,689 --> 00:56:25,243
Is this the rabbit hole
you really wanna go down?

919
00:56:27,591 --> 00:56:28,419
Yes.

920
00:56:30,697 --> 00:56:32,492
Because there's nothing here.

00:56:43,814 --> 00:56:46,541
[static buzzing]

923
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:50,993
Hi, Uncle Jack.

924
00:56:52,823 --> 00:56:53,651
Hey, Zo.

925
00:56:56,343 --> 00:56:57,586
Did you check on my mom?

926
00:56:59,312 --> 00:57:00,486
Yeah.

927
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,694
Is she okay?

928
00:57:04,351 --> 00:57:06,353
You're gonna stay with us for
a while.

929
00:57:08,252 --> 00:57:09,840
She doesn't wanna say goodbye?

930
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:12,981
You know how your mom is.

931
00:57:16,709 --> 00:57:17,537
I know.

932
00:57:21,058 --> 00:57:22,542
I'm okay, Uncle Jack.

933
00:57:24,026 --> 00:57:25,787
I want my mom to feel better.

934
00:57:26,891 --> 00:57:30,481
Besides, I like it here best
anyway.

935
00:57:33,173 --> 00:57:34,658
Let's get you to bed, kiddo.

936
00:57:35,969 --> 00:57:37,143
Hugs.

937
00:57:37,177 --> 00:57:39,041
Mm-hm, good night, Grandma.

938
00:57:39,076 --> 00:57:39,870
I love you.

939
00:57:39,904 --> 00:57:41,734
I love you too.

940
00:57:41,768 --> 00:57:42,562
Good night.

941
00:57:42,597 --> 00:57:43,563
I'll see you up there.

942
00:57:43,598 --> 00:57:44,461
Okay.

943
00:57:47,636 --> 00:57:50,052
She finally did it, didn't she?

944
00:57:50,087 --> 00:57:52,503
[soft music]

945
00:57:58,751 --> 00:58:00,511
[Zoey] Did you lock all
the doors and windows?

946
00:58:00,546 --> 00:58:03,307
Yes, no one can get in.

947
00:58:03,341 --> 00:58:05,102
Not the monster from the woods?

948
00:58:05,136 --> 00:58:05,965
No.

949
00:58:07,035 --> 00:58:09,313
Not the monster in the closet?

950
00:58:09,347 --> 00:58:11,418
Nope.

951
00:58:11,453 --> 00:58:13,800
What about the one in the
cellar?

952
00:58:13,835 --> 00:58:14,974
Not that one either.

953
00:58:16,009 --> 00:58:16,838
Good.

954
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:21,670
I promise I won't let
any of them hurt you.

955
00:58:23,534 --> 00:58:24,362
Promise?

956
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:27,331
Promise.

957
00:58:28,539 --> 00:58:29,920
Now get some sleep.

958
00:58:29,954 --> 00:58:32,854
[soft piano music]

959
00:58:35,408 --> 00:58:36,513
Night, Zoey.

960
00:58:36,547 --> 00:58:37,617
Good night.

961
00:58:37,652 --> 00:58:40,551
[soft piano music]

962
00:58:43,968 --> 00:58:46,488
[car passing]

963
00:58:49,284 --> 00:58:52,598
[indistinct clattering]

964
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:57,844
[indistinct clattering]

965
00:58:57,879 --> 00:59:01,330
[soft suspenseful music]

966
00:59:03,263 --> 00:59:04,092
Hello?

967
00:59:06,853 --> 00:59:07,682
Hello!

968
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:11,306
[Liz sighing]

969
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:13,688
[soft suspenseful music]

970
00:59:13,722 --> 00:59:16,829
[dramatic crescendo]

971
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:19,866
[suspenseful music]

972
01:00:32,974 --> 01:00:35,632
[pick striking]

973
01:00:37,944 --> 01:00:40,671
What are you doing, Uncle Jack?

974
01:00:41,568 --> 01:00:42,673
I'm proving to you that there
isn't

975
01:00:42,708 --> 01:00:44,330
anything buried in the basement.

976
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,885
Thought you already said there
wasn't.

977
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,025
I wanna make sure for you.

978
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:53,822
[soft suspenseful music]

979
01:00:53,857 --> 01:00:54,685
Mm.

980
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:03,211
[switch clicking]

981
01:01:07,525 --> 01:01:10,597
[dramatic crescendo]

982
01:01:10,632 --> 01:01:13,359
[dramatic music]

983
01:01:23,645 --> 01:01:24,922
[Nix laughing]

984
01:01:24,957 --> 01:01:27,787
[lights clicking]

985
01:01:31,515 --> 01:01:34,829
[pick striking]

986
01:01:34,863 --> 01:01:38,280
[pick clattering]

987
01:01:38,315 --> 01:01:41,698
[soft suspenseful music]

988
01:01:51,742 --> 01:01:52,881
Can I help?

989
01:01:52,916 --> 01:01:55,366
[soft music]

990
01:01:58,611 --> 01:02:00,613
Who does that belong to?

991
01:02:01,648 --> 01:02:02,960
It's my dad's.

992
01:02:04,859 --> 01:02:08,552
Jack! What are you doing to my
floor?

993
01:02:08,586 --> 01:02:10,796
This is unacceptable!

994
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:11,693
I, I...

995
01:02:12,694 --> 01:02:13,522
Okay, Mom.

996
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:15,559
Ugh.

997
01:02:16,698 --> 01:02:17,526
Ugh.

998
01:02:18,804 --> 01:02:22,083
[soft suspenseful music]

999
01:02:22,117 --> 01:02:22,946
So?

1000
01:02:24,706 --> 01:02:25,534
Open it.

1001
01:02:27,882 --> 01:02:30,436
[latch clicking]

1002
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:33,853
[soft suspenseful music]

1003
01:02:40,653 --> 01:02:43,552
It's all the stuff from my
childhood.

1004
01:02:43,587 --> 01:02:45,002
My dad must a put it here.

1005
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:48,350
[soft music]

1006
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:55,599
What's that?

1007
01:02:57,118 --> 01:02:58,498
[sighs] It's a videotape.

1008
01:02:59,948 --> 01:03:01,432
What does it do?

1009
01:03:01,467 --> 01:03:02,779
It plays movies.

1010
01:03:02,813 --> 01:03:04,366
So it's a phone?

1011
01:03:05,678 --> 01:03:08,060
It plays videos like your phone.

1012
01:03:08,094 --> 01:03:10,096
It's what we used when we were
your age.

1013
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:13,617
So that's it.

1014
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:16,033
There's nothing in here.

1015
01:03:19,105 --> 01:03:21,936
Sometimes our imaginations run
wild.

1016
01:03:23,316 --> 01:03:24,628
We could think of some
really great things,

1017
01:03:24,662 --> 01:03:27,251
or we can conjure up
some really bad things.

1018
01:03:28,252 --> 01:03:31,152
Sometimes, if you tell the
same story over and over again,

1019
01:03:32,325 --> 01:03:33,810
it takes on a life of its own.

1020
01:03:35,225 --> 01:03:37,641
[soft music]

1021
01:03:37,675 --> 01:03:38,504
Like the Nix?

1022
01:03:40,023 --> 01:03:41,956
Where did you hear that?

1023
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:43,716
I saw it on the mirror that day.

1024
01:03:45,062 --> 01:03:46,753
And I heard my dad talk about
it.

1025
01:03:49,895 --> 01:03:51,758
He told me it was going to
destroy us.

1026
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:53,657
All of us.

1027
01:03:59,663 --> 01:04:02,562
[knocking on door]

1028
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,467
What did you see?

1029
01:04:10,501 --> 01:04:12,227
It doesn't matter what I saw.

1030
01:04:12,262 --> 01:04:13,746
The important part is that we're
letting

1031
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:17,198
our imagination get the best
of us and it's not healthy.

1032
01:04:17,232 --> 01:04:18,406
What if you're wrong?

1033
01:04:21,202 --> 01:04:22,859
I think I have proof.

1034
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,828
I found one of my videotapes
buried in the basement.

1035
01:04:28,209 --> 01:04:30,556
All the videotapes I made when I
was a kid

1036
01:04:30,590 --> 01:04:32,765
are gone, except this one.

1037
01:04:33,973 --> 01:04:36,769
We put our hands in the
cement when I was seven.

1038
01:04:37,735 --> 01:04:39,910
I got my video camera when I was
10.

1039
01:04:42,533 --> 01:04:44,742
Let's find out what's on there.

1040
01:04:46,296 --> 01:04:49,057
[video whirring]

1041
01:04:54,614 --> 01:04:57,479
[wind whipping]

1042
01:04:57,514 --> 01:05:00,241
[video whirring]

1043
01:05:01,276 --> 01:05:05,453
[soft suspenseful music]

1044
01:05:05,487 --> 01:05:08,283
[Kids] We want food! We want
food!

1045
01:05:08,318 --> 01:05:11,562
[Donna] Okay, okay,
we hear you [laughs].

1046
01:05:11,597 --> 01:05:12,701
[Tessa] We want food!

1047
01:05:12,736 --> 01:05:13,633
Rich, how long till...

1048
01:05:13,668 --> 01:05:17,775
You marinate the ketchup with
the onions

1049
01:05:17,810 --> 01:05:21,020
and just keep stirring it
around, okay.

1050
01:05:22,021 --> 01:05:25,059
[Jack] Guys, guys, wait up.

1051
01:05:25,093 --> 01:05:26,198
Tessa, smile!

1052
01:05:28,959 --> 01:05:31,720
[ball splashing]

1053
01:05:31,755 --> 01:05:34,758
[suspenseful music]

1054
01:05:48,254 --> 01:05:49,842
Did you see that?

1055
01:05:50,912 --> 01:05:52,327
You were dead.

1056
01:05:52,362 --> 01:05:53,501
Jack, that's not funny.

1057
01:05:53,535 --> 01:05:55,365
I'm not joking, see!

1058
01:05:55,399 --> 01:05:58,161
[static buzzing]

1059
01:06:01,198 --> 01:06:02,027
Nothing's there.

1060
01:06:03,028 --> 01:06:04,339
[Tessa] I love you, Mom.

1061
01:06:06,203 --> 01:06:08,688
[Donna] Is that Tessa? I hear
her voice.

1062
01:06:08,723 --> 01:06:10,345
No, Mom, Liz is here.

1063
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:12,830
Hi, Mrs. Coyle.

1064
01:06:12,865 --> 01:06:13,831
[Donna] Good night.

1065
01:06:17,145 --> 01:06:19,699
[Tessa laughing]

1066
01:06:19,734 --> 01:06:22,944
I don't know what to believe.
I don't know what's real.

1067
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:26,913
I don't know what to do with
my mom or how to help Zoey.

1068
01:06:26,948 --> 01:06:29,399
I need to find the truth.

1069
01:06:31,056 --> 01:06:33,644
[door banging]

1070
01:06:35,543 --> 01:06:37,752
Stop, stop!

1071
01:06:37,786 --> 01:06:40,479
Why are you doing this to
yourself?

1072
01:06:40,513 --> 01:06:44,621
There are answers on this
tape and out in the woods.

1073
01:06:44,655 --> 01:06:48,556
Lucas knew what this thing
was! It took his life!

1074
01:06:48,590 --> 01:06:51,835
If something happens to you,
who's gonna watch after Zoey?

1075
01:06:53,457 --> 01:06:55,666
I have to go out there.

1076
01:06:58,324 --> 01:06:59,843
Careful. Please.

1077
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:03,467
[engine starting]

1078
01:07:03,502 --> 01:07:06,505
[suspenseful music]

1079
01:07:15,928 --> 01:07:19,656
[engine idling and shutting off]

[video whirring]

1084
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:46,200
[Tessa] Hey, Jack, come and
find me!

1085
01:07:48,788 --> 01:07:51,895
Hey, Champ, you guys wanna
know what...

1086
01:07:51,929 --> 01:07:52,758
What?

1087
01:07:57,452 --> 01:07:59,972
Stay where you are.

1088
01:08:00,006 --> 01:08:02,595
Don't come back. They're all
dead.

1089
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:05,357
[static buzzing]

1090
01:08:06,565 --> 01:08:09,844
The secret ingredient
is sharp cheddar cheese.

1091
01:08:09,878 --> 01:08:13,261
And then you put it on an
English muffin...

1092
01:08:13,296 --> 01:08:17,369
[soft suspenseful music]

1093
01:08:17,403 --> 01:08:18,404
- Dad.
- Dad.

1094
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:24,893
Someone's watching us.

1095
01:08:25,929 --> 01:08:28,828
[burgers sizzling]

1096
01:08:29,864 --> 01:08:31,003
Hello?

1097
01:08:31,037 --> 01:08:34,420
[soft suspenseful music]

1098
01:08:35,456 --> 01:08:37,941
What are you doing over there?

1099
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:44,534
Mister, are you lost?

1100
01:08:45,845 --> 01:08:46,915
Yeah, sorry.

1101
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:49,366
Can you point me in the
direction of the main road?

1102
01:08:50,505 --> 01:08:52,507
Yeah, sure. It's right over
there.

1103
01:08:55,717 --> 01:08:56,649
You guys camping?

1104
01:08:58,444 --> 01:08:59,963
