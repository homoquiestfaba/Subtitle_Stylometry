1
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,800
I'm gonna say our mantra.

2
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,400
''This is the voice I want to use. ''

3
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,400
over and over again.
but with different inflections.

4
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,900
and I want you to try to mimic
what I'm doing.

5
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,700
This is the voice I want to use.

6
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,600
This is the voice I want to use.

7
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,800
Now. what we're gonna do
is press down on our tongue

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,800
and sot of watch what's happening
at the back of our mouths.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,300
Ready?

10
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,500
Aaaah...

11
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,200
Any suicidal tendencies?

12
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,000
No.

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,800
You ever felt
as though you were being followed?

14
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,800
No.

15
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,600
Any history of family mental illness?

16
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,100
No.

17
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,700
Medical procedures to date?

18
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,200
The usual electrolysis.
three years of hormone therapy.

19
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,400
facial feminization surgery.
brow lift. forehead reduction.

20
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,000
jaw re-contouring.
and a tracheal shave.

21
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,600
You look very authentic.

22
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,200
I try to blend in.
Keep a low profile.

23
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,500
I believe the slang terminology
is ''Living Stealth. ''

24
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,700
Do you consider yourself
a happy person?

25
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,300
Yes.

26
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,000
l mean, no.

27
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,500
l mean...

28
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
l will be.

29
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,500
Miss Osbourne,

30
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,900
there's no such thing
as a right answer in this office.

31
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,100
Yes, l'm a very happy person.

32
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,400
How can l help you
if you won't be honest with me?

33
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,300
You can sign that consent form.

34
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
Please.

35
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,500
The American Psychiatric Association

36
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,000
categorizes gender dysphoria
as a very serious mental disorder.

37
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,700
After my operation,

38
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,100
not even a gynecologist
will be able to detect

39
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,000
anything out of the ordinary
about my body.

40
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,300
l will be a woman.

41
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,600
Don't you find it odd
that plastic surgery

42
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,500
can cure a mental disorder?

43
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,400
How do you feel about your penis?

44
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,900
lt disgusts me.

45
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,800
l don't even like looking at it.

46
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,700
What about friends?

47
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,700
They don't like it, either.

48
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,500
No, l mean,
do you have the support of friends?

49
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,100
l'm very close to my therapist.

50
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,700
What about your family?

51
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,100
My family is dead.

52
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,000
You take some hormones

53
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,000
And l'll take some hormones

54
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,400
l'll be a woman before you

55
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,200
Make me happy when skies...

56
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,000
Shit.

57
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,200
l mean darn.

58
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,300
Darn. l mean darn it.

59
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,300
Darn it, darn it, darn it.

60
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,100
Mmm.

61
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,400
Good night, Bree.

62
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,800
Sleep tight, Bree.

63
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,100
Hmm.

64
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,900
I Orale !

65
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,900
Oh!

66
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,500
This is the voice.

67
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,700
l...this...

68
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,500
this is the voice.

69
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,500
This is the voice.

70
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,500
Hello.
May l please speak to

71
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,500
Mrs. or Mrs. Bhumibol Niratpattanasani?

72
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,900
Mrs. Niratpattanasani,
this is Bree Osbourne calling

73
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,900

74

from the National Home Shopping...

75
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,000
Hello?

76
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,700
Hello.

77
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,300
Stanley Schupak
doesn't live here anymore.

78
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,900
Who's calling?

79
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,300
Stanley doesn't have a son.

80
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,400
You must have the wrong number.

81
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,000
How old are you?

82
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,300
Why don't you call your mother?

83
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,100
Hello. May l please speak
to Mr. Jamal Niang?

84
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,200
Mr. Niang, it's Bree Osbourne calling
from the National Home Shopping Club

85
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,200
with a special introductory rate
of only $19.90...

86
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,900
Hello?

87
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,700
He signed it.

88
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,500
l am so proud of you!
Two signatures.

89
00:06:54,700 --> 00:07:01,200
l hereby pronounce you officially legal
to undergo sexual reassignment surgery.

90
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,000
Thank you.

91
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,800
l just...

92
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Mmm.

93
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,000
Thank you.

94
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,400
So...

95
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
What else is new?

96
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,900
l made my sales quota
for the month on Tuesday.

97
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,800
That pink lamb's wool cardigan
that l ordered arrived.

98
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,300
Oh, and this is odd.

99
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,000
l got a phone call last night

100
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
from a juvenile inmate
of the New York prison system.

101
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,500
- He claimed to be Stanley's son.
- No third person.

102
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,900
My son.

103
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,100
l thought you told me
that you were a virgin.

104
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,300
Hmm.

105
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
There was this one girl at college,

106
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,400
but the whole thing was so...

107
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,000
tragically lesbian that
l didn't think it counted.

108
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,600
Wow!

109
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,500
A son.

110
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,600
An alleged son.

111
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,500
He's probably just
some sort of scam artist.

112
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,100
What is he scamming you for?

113
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,100
Well, l guess we'll never know.

114
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,800
Nothing is gonna stop me

115
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,800
from checking into
that hospital next week.

116
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,100
l'm not gonna get dragged back
into Stanley's old life.

117
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,300
Stanley's life is your life.

118
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,800
Why don't you get in touch
with the mother?

119
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
She's dead.

120
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,000
Anyway, he's practically 1 8.

121
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,800
He's old enough
to take care of himself.

122
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,200
Bree...
this is a part of your body

123
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,100
that cannot be discarded.

124
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,900
l don't want you to go through
this metamorphosis

125
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,200
only to find out
you're still incomplete.

126
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,100
What if l...

127
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,500
visit him later...

128
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,100
after my surgery...

129
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,200
after l've settled into my new life?

130
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,900
When you're ready.

131
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,100
What are you doing?

132
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,700
l can't give this
to your surgeon right now.

133
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,900
Yes, you can.

134
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,800
Margaret, l can't miss
my surgery on Friday.

135
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
They're booked up a year in advance.

136
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,800
l'll wire bail money to New York.

137
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,700
l'll-l'll call a social worker

138
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,600
and have someone
check in on him.

139
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,700
What do you want me to do?

140
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,700
Bree, honey...

141
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,400
l just want you to be ready.

142
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,100
Hello. May l please
have the number

143
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,400

downtown lock-up?

144
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,400
MAN:
Mr. Schupak.

145
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,200

146
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,700
l mean, Ms. Osbourne.
l changed it.

147
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,600
Can l ask what your relationship
is to the prisoner?

148
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,200
Allegedly, l'm his...

149
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,600
allegedly, he's my son.

150
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,100
This is a new one.

151
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,800
According to this,
he shoplifted a frog.

152
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,400
Plus we have testimony
that he was in possession

153
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,300
of a small amount
of a suspicious-looking white powder,

154
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,000
although emergency services
was unable to recover the evidence.

155
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,900
Drugs?

156
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,300
ls he an addict?

157
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,900
Most of 'em are.

158
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,100
Most of whom are?

159
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,700
Are you aware that your son's
been hustling on the streets

160
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,100
working as a prostitute?

161
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,600
- How much is the bail?
- Bail's set at one dollar.

162
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,400
l can't possibly afford...

163
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,000
one dollar?

164
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,600
MAN:
Sabrina Claire Osbourne?

165
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,000

166
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,400
Uh...

167
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,600
my friends call me Bree.

168
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,900
Jesus the reformer?

169
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,200
That's one of these churches
that sends missionaries out

170
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,600
to guide street people back to God.

171
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,200
No.

172
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,900

173
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,600

Travelin' through

177
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,300
Oh, yes.

178
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,600
Dear God...

179
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,900

and bless this restaurant

180
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,200

And everyone else...everywhere.

Sic transit gloria mundi.
in excelsis Deo.

183
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,400
Amen.

184
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,800
Do you have any percs?

185
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,000
Vicodin?
Anything with codeine?

186
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,400
Sorry. l'm all out.

187
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,800
So why don't you tell me
something about yourself.

188
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,400
l'm not naming any names.

189
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,400
l said about yourself.

190
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,400
ls Toby short for something?

191
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,300
A diminutive?

192
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,900
No, it's American.

193
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,800
Where do you come from?

194
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,300
Callicoon.

195
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,300
Where's Callicoon?

196
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,400
ln Kentucky. Duh.

197
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,800
ls that where your family is?

198
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,500
My mother's dead.

199
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,100
She had a stroke.

200
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,200
- ls there anyone else?
- l had a step-father.

201
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,600
- That's wonderful.
- Me and him don't get along.

202
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Why not?

203
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,400
T.M.l.

204
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,400
Too much information.

205
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,900
What about grandparents?

206
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,600
Aunts, uncles?

207
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
l don't need any family.
l can take care of myself.

208
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,600
l'm a loner.

209
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,400
That's wonderful.
That's the spirit.

210
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,700
l've been meanin'
to thank you for bailin' me out.

211
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,100
You're welcome.

212
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,900
l decided in jail
l'm gonna give up hustling.

213
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,200
lt's degradable.

214
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,600
Degrading.

215
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,200
How many people
inhabit this place?

216
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,100
Three.

217
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,200
Dude, by the way,

218
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,400
l was just holding those drugs
for a friend.

219
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
l'm not stupid.

220
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,800
Junkies just live for the day.

221
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,700
No ambition or anything.

222
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,000
- You have ambition?
- Yeah.

223
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
l'm gonna get a career in the movies.

224
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,300
Ten, twenty, forty.

225
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,000
Sixty, eighty.

226
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,100
One hundred.

227
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,500
Here.

228
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,100
Will that hold you for a while?

229
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,600
Yeah.
Dude, this is great.

230
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,800
l wish you would
stop calling me dude.

231
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,700
Well, l best be on my way.

232
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,100
Got a flight to Los Angeles
first thing in the morning.

233
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,300
Maybe l'll see ya out there.

234
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,500
That's where they make
the movies, right?

235
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,500
l was gonna hitchhike out there
like, maybe, tomorrow.

236
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,000
You can't.

237
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,200
You don't wanna add
jumping bail to your permanent record.

238
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,300
l'll change my street name.

239
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,300
Something like Stanley.

240
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,800
Stan.

241
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,700
Stan the man.
That's my dad's name.

242
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,800
There's his picture.

243
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,300
He's with my mom.

244
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,700
Mmm.

245
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
You okay?

246
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,400
l'm a little dizzy.

247
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,900
Beverly Hills
is close to the ocean, right?

248
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,200
Maybe l'll learn how to surf.

249
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,200
Dye my hair blonde
for the movies.

250
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,800
They love blondes there.

251
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,300
l mean, blonde and blondes.

252
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,500
Stocks and blondes.

253
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,200
Bodacious blonde bottoms.

254
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,800
Not that l'm a bottom or anything.

255
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,900
Are you talking about
pornographic films?

256
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,700
Duh.

257
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,400
ls there a...

258
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,300
ladies room
in this establishment?

259
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,900
Oh!

260
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,200
- Hello.
- Margaret.

261
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,700
lt's Bree.
l'm in New York.

262
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:28,200
lt turns out this whole jail episode
was just a big mistake.

263
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,100
Talk to me.

264
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,000
He's a thoroughly independent
young man.

265
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,800
We're getting along famously.

266
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,300
He's going to come visit me
after my surgery,

267
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,500
and l promised to take him
to Disneyland.

268
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,300
l see.

269
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,400
So I tIhougIht I'd take
an early fligIht back tomorrow.

270
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,800
get back to work.

271
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
recoup some of tIhe money
I spent on tIhis trip

272
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,300
before my surgery next week.

273
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,900
- How are you?
- Right now,

274
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,000
l'm a little disappointed
because you're lying to me.

275
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,800
ls there anything else
you'd like to say?

276
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,400
There appears to be a step-father.

277
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,400
PerIhaps I can affect a reunion.

278
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,400
Have you ever head of
a place called Callicoon?

279
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:21,600
l just conferred with
my immediate superior at the church.

280
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,500
lt seems she feels
that getting you away

281
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,900
from this unwholesome
environment is my moral duty.

282
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,800
Free ride, free food,
free hotel rooms,

283
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,600
all the way to L.A.

284
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,200
Uh-huh.
Nothin's free.

285
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,700
You're gonna end up marryin' her
and spending the rest of your life

286
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,900
eating out cob-webby
old stank Christian pussy.

287
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
Hey, something
for the road, my man?

288
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,000
The finest Tecate.

289
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,100
Fuck, no, man.
l'm givin' that shit up.

290
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,900
Come on. lt's only
five dollars a bag over street price.

291
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,500
Convenience charge.

292
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,600
We could take it out of your cut
if she buys the car.

293
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,100
Fuck you, dude.

294
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,000
All right.

295
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,300
Whatever.
You're the man.

296
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,800
No, wait. Hey.

297
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,600
l'm not marrying you.

298
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,200
Glory Hallelujah.

299
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,800
Almost new fan belt.

300
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,700
l changed the oil
a couple of months ago.

301
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,500
Only 230,000 miles.

302
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,200
lt just needs a little paint.

303
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,000
That's all.
lt runs perfect.

304
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,300
Guaranteed.

305
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,800
l've already arranged a rental.

306
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,900
But with this one,
when you get to California,

307
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,900
you could resell, make a profit.

308
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,100
A profit?

309
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,300
Fasten your seatbelt.

310
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,900
l don't like wearing them.

311
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,600
Well, l don't like the idea
of seeing your internal organs

312
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,100
splattered all over the dashboard

313
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,700
in case we get in a wreck,
God forbid, so put it on.

314
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,900
See this shirt?

315
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,900
Only cost me two dollars.

316
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,300
- Quel surprise.
- And the shoes.

317
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,300
Three dollars-- $1 .50 each.

318
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,000
You know how much these things
are worth in Japan?

319
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,500
- Three dollars.
- Like $500.

320
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,900
Japanese people
will kill for old Nikes.

321
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,200
Then you probably
should avoid wearing them in Japan.

322
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,500
Yeah, l'd probably be,
like, disemboweled by a ninja.

323
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,200
You don't have to say ''Like.''

324
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,800
''Probably disemboweled
by a ninja'' is sufficient.

325
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,500
And please don't put your feet
up on the dashboard.

326
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,800
No smoking in the car.

327
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,900
l thought instead
of going west on route 95,

328
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,200
we'd wind through
the mountains on route 20.

329
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,900
- Route 20 takes us close to Callicoon.
- l don't want to go there.

330
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,200
What l find absolutely
beyond comprehension

331
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,600
is how a person can perform
all those intimate acts

332
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,300
with just any stranger off the street.

333
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,400
Why should you give a shit?

334
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,400
Because it's
the Christian thing to do.

335
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,300
How much money did you make
per...assignation?

336
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,400
Forty or fifty dollars.

337
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,900
Are we gonna be
goin' through Texas?

338
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,800
lt's a pretty hard state to avoid.

339
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,800
Do you have any money for some food?

340
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,100
Oh.

341
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,500
Uh, l'm sorry l can't offer you
a private room.

342
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,800
The church has to conserve
its resources.

343
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,200
l've charted us a course
on the nice little red routes.

344
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,200
Callicoon is only about
45 minutes out of our way.

345
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,200
l don't wanna go there.

346
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,400
These are nice beds.

347
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,600
Don't you have any pajamas?

348
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,400
No.

349
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,200
Well, you should get some.

350
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,700
Good night.

351
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,300
Rise and shine.

352
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,900
Up, up, up.

353
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,300
We've got a schedule to keep.

354
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,400
Did l put on too much blush?

355
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,700
You're weird.

356
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,100
Hmm.

357
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,900
First place l lived was, like,
a hole in the wall off Avenue C.

358
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,800
l had, like, four roommates.

359
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,300
One was a junkie,
one was a crack head,

360
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,800
one was, like,
a junkie, and the other one was,

361
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,600
well, like, a junkie.

362
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,100
Like, like, like.

363
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,500
Did you know
tIhe Lord Of TIhe Rings is gay?

364
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,500
l beg your pardon.

365
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,800
There's this big,
black tower, right?

366
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:48,100
And it points right at
this huge burning vagina thing,

367
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,200
and it's, like,
the symbol of ultimate evil.

368
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,300
And then,

369
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,600
Sam and Frodo
have to go into this cave

370
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,400
and deposit their magic ring

371
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,200
into this hot, steaming lava pit.

372
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,000
Only at the last minute,

373
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,800
Frodo can't perform,
so Gollum bites off his finger.

374
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,900
Gay.

375
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,700
Take 'em away

376
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,400
Take 'em away, Lord

377
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,500
Take away these chains from me

378
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,000
My heart is broken
'cause my spirit's not free

379
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,700
Lord, take away
these chains from me

380
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,200
Some birds' feathers
are too proud to be caged

381
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,700
l know l'm not that colorful

382
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,200
But a bird just the same

383
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,100
Open up your gate now,
let me put down my load

384
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,600
So l can feel at ease
and go back to my home

385
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,600
Take 'em away

386
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,100
Take 'em away, Lord

387
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,700
Take away these chains from me

388
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,700
What the fuck you lookin' at?

389
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,000
l just didn't think it was right

390
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,200
to come so close to Callicoon
without at least passing through.

391
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,500
Toby!

392
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,200
Where are you going?

393
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,100
You are acting like
a spoiled child.

394
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,400
Oh, my God,
l can't believe my eyes.

395
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,900
lt's my sweet little angel baby.

396
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,400
Take away these chains from me

397
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,200
My heart is broken
'cause my spirit's not free

398
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,400
Just give me another hug.

399
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,100
Oh, l could wring your neck
like a chicken.

400
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,300
My favorite boy.

401
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,500
And all this time,
not even a phone call

402
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,800
to let me know if
you're alive or dead.

403
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,100
l was never your favorite.

404
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,800
Oh, that's what you think.

405
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,300
l used to look at him
out that window,

406
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,500
playin' all day with that big dog.

407
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,900
Toby lived near here?

408
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,800
Just two doors up the road.

409
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,500
So, what you
been doin' with yourself?

410
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,500
l wanna know everything.

411
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,400
He's been in New York,
working toward developing

412
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,200
a career in the film industry.

413
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,100
l'm goin' to California.

414
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,400
California?!

415
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,900
He always was the artistic type.

416
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,200
He used to have
this precious stuffed monkey

417
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,200
he carried around with him everywhere,
even to school.

418
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,900
Are you in
the movie business, too?

419
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,300
She's a missionary with the church.

420
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,200
Praise the Lord.

421
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,100
l'm an electrologist myself.

422
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,400
Oh.

423
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,600
lf you want, l can get

424
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,500
those couple of little hairs
up under your nose in nothin' flat.

425
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,000
My boss lady down at the salon,

426
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,500
she used to work out in California.

427
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,700
From what l hear, some of them
Hollywood beauties

428
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
used to be hairy as hogs.

429
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,500
There.

430
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,800
That oughta keep 'em from
stickin' their heads up again.

431
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Thank you.

432
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,800
You ought to go on over
and say hello to your step-daddy.

433
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,400
- l don't wanna see him.
- Of course you do.

434
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,800
The man raised you.

435
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,900
Clothed you.
Fed you.

436
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,600
Sheltered you from harm.

437
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,400
He's your father...

438
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,700
for all practical purposes.

439
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,500
He always was a sensitive thing.

440
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,100
You gonna drive him
all the way to California?

441
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,700
l have to get some air.
Excuse me, and thank you.

442
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,800
- Yeah?
- Good evening.

443
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,100
Do you per chance
know a Toby Wilkins?

444
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,600
Who's askin'?

445
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,100
l am a bearer of glad tidings.

446
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,800
Your son has come home.

447
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,100
Good.

448
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,600
- Toby, Arletty.

449
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,100
l brought back a surprise.

450
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,500
Come on in.

451
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,600
Look who's here.

452
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,500
lf you can't bring
Mohammad to the mountain,

453
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,300
bring the mountain to Mohammad.

454
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,400
Look how much you've grown.

455
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,900
Toby, give your father a hug.

456
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,500
l was worried sick about you.

457
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,300
Why did you run off like that?
You know l missed you.

458
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,600
- lsn't this sweet?
- Mm-Hmm.

459
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,100
l know what you missed.

460
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,100
You missed my mouth.
You missed my ass.

461
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,400
You hush now.

462
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,800
What are these ladies gonna think?

463
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,700
You wanna fuck me
right here in front of 'em?

464
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,800
You shut up!

465
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,900
Bobby!

466
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,100
Was that good for you?

467
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,600
Come on, Bobby.

468
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,300
You liked it.

469
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,100
- You liked it in the garage.
- Shut up!

470
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,300
Come on.

471
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,200
Toby?

472
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,800
Honey?

473
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,300
This man is heavy with sin.

474
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,200
Put him in that chair there.

475
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,300
l don't know you,
Bobby Jensen.

476
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,600
He'll come to in a couple of hours.

477
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
This isn't my fault!

478
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,100
You never told me
why you didn't want to come home.

479
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,200
Where are you going?

480
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,600
Brought you some breakfast.

481
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,100
He's walkin' down to the highway ramp
to hitchhike hisself a ride.

482
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,900
He's a disappearing act, all right.

483
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,600
lt's the same thing he did
after his mama killed herself.

484
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,600
- She what?
- Mm-hmm.

485
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,100
Shut herself up in the garage
with the car on.

486
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,700
Toby found her there
when he come home from school.

487
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,800
Oh, God.

488
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,700
Lovely scenery
in this part of the country.

489
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,400
l said l'd take a ride from you.

490
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,600
l never said l'd carry on
a fucking conversation.

491
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,000
l was just trying to do you a favor.

492
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,000
God knows,

493
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,100
considering the way
you've been living your life,

494
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
it wasn't unreasonable
to try to put you under

495
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,600
some sort of parental supervision.

496
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,900
What's that?

497
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,200
ls that drugs?

498
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,400
Oh, no.
Absolutely not.

499
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,900
Goddamn it!

500
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,400
No! That is not all right.
You can't do that here.

501
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,700
Are you gonna let me do my thing,

502
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,900
or do l have to get out
of this fucking car right now?

503
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,700
- Huh?
- Go ahead.

504
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,600
Kill yourself.

505
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,500
What does it matter to me?

506
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,700
One chocolate milkshake for you
and coffee for your mother.

507
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,500
- l'm not his mother.
- She's not my mother.

508
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,100
Thank you.

509
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,200
You promised
with the new moon

510
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,600
You'd be comin' back to me

511
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,200
Now many moons have passed

512
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,400
Still l'm waitin' patiently

513
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,900
There's a new moon
over my shoulder

514
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,400
And an old love
still in my heart

515
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,800
l didn't sleep a wink last night.

516
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,500
- Let's look for a motel.
- l'm camping out.

517
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:29,300
Do you have something
a trifle less...butch?

518
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,400
Fettuccine al fredo

519
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,100
or chicken cordon bleu.

520
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,800
Chicken.

521
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,300
Uh... matches?

522
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,600
Fuck!

523
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,900
Excuse me.

524
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,100
l have to go to the ladies room.

525
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,900
Do you think there
are snakes around here?

526
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,900
Shoo! Shoo!

527
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,800
Shoo!!

528
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,100
Get away, snake.

529
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,600
Get away, you snake.

530
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,100
Get away, snake.

531
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,500
Where did you get that?

532
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,700
l had it.

533
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,300
- What is that awful sound?
- lt's a loon.

534
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:54,500
Certain Native American tribes
of the Northern plains

535
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,500
believed loons were ancestral spirits,

536
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:01,000
trying to communicate
with the physical world.

537
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,500
My real dad's part lndian.

538
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,300
- ls he?
- Yeah.

539
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,100
l mean, he never told me,
but l just know.

540
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,600
lt's an lndian thing.

541
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,300
Do you think you could find it
in your heart

542
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,600
to offer a sip of that to a lady?

543
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,600
Are you sick or something?

544
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,600
l'm fine.

545
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
These are vitamins.

546
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,000
When l was a little girl,
l had a terrycloth bunny.

547
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,900
l used to sleep with her every night.

548
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,600
- Try holding your breath.

549
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,900
Then one day, my parents decided

550
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:53,500
l was too old for her,
and l never saw her again.

551
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,900
l found...

552
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,800
him...

553
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,300
in your step-father's garage.

554
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,900
Oh!

555
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,200
Oh!

556
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,500
Oh, uh... here.

557
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,700
Rise and shine.
Come on.

558
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,100
Let's go.

559
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,800
l've gotta be in L.A.
By the end of the week.

560
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
What would you say if l told you

561
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,400
l could set you up with a job
in the telemarketing field?

562
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:53,600
The nice thing about telemarketing
is you can live practically anyplace.

563
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,100
l could drop you off in Austin.

564
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,200
l'm going to California.

565
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,300
My real dad has
a mansion there with a pool.

566
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:06,400
What do you see your life like
ten years from now?

567
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,100
Probably get a job at a pet store.

568
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,300
Have a dog, maybe some kids.

569
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,600
Kids.

570
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,000
l always wanted kids.

571
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,900
Perhaps you ought to aim for
something a little higher

572
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,300
than working in a pet store.

573
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,400
lf you like animals,
you could become a veterinarian

574
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,300
or a zoologist.

575
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,300
l'm out of cigarettes.

576
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,500
Quel dommage.

577
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,000
What does quel dommage mean?

578
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,500
lt means you're not
getting any cigarettes.

579
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,300
Are you a boy or a girl?

580
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,300
Turn around and stop
botherin' people.

581
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,400
Margaret, thank God.

582
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,600
l am in the middle of Arkansas,

583
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,500
and an eight-year-old child
just read me.

584
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,600
l can't handle this.

585
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,100
l had to camp out last night...

586
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,200
on the ground...

587
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,100
with bugs.

588
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,900
Because he is impossible.

589
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,700
l can't fritter away
my savings like this.

590
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,900
- My surgery's only five days away.
- Shit!

591
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,500
Dallas?
l don't know.

592
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,600
Four or five hours.
Why?

593
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,500
Ho-ho-hold on.

594
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:12,200
Toby.
Toby!

595
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,900
Would you mind introducing me
to your new friend?

596
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,700
Taylor.

597
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,900
Yeah.
This is Taylor.

598
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,600
lt's nice to meet you, Taylor.

599
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,000
What's goin' on here?

600
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,200
Come on.

601
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,000
Your mother's waitin'
for you in the car.

602
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,300
You better watch out he doesn't get
some poor, innocent girl in trouble.

603
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,900
You better watch out
she doesn't end up

604
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,400
ruining some poor,
innocent boy's life.

605
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,900
You...

606
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,700
go wait for me at the table.

607
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,800
Margaret...

608
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,000
l really don't think
l am cut out to be a mother.

609
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,000
Dear God, bless this meal,

610
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,800
and please help Toby
to find the strength

611
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,800
not to take any more drugs,

612
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,900
so that when we get to L.A.,
he can get a job

613
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,300
and find a nice apartment

614
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,000
so that even if he never finds
his real father,

615
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,100
he can lead an independent life.

616
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,500
Amen.

617
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,800
Amen.

618
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,700
There's a really cool hat back there.
lt's only ten dollars.

619
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,500
l think my nose is getting sunburned.

620
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,800
Eat your vegetables.

621
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:48,100
You might want to use a fork.
Just an idea.

622
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,600
l tell you what.

623
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,600
You can have that hat
on one condition.

624
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,700
No more drugs.

625
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,500
l mean it.

626
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,900
Deal?

627
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,200
Deal.

628
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,700
Got you a present.

629
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,400
Thank you. l'm very...

630
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,900
touched.

631
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,100
Put it on.

632
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,000
lt looks good.

633
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:39,800
l found Jesus
in the darkest night

634
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,500
You get back in here!

635
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:46,100
Do you have any idea
how dangerous that is?

636
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,700
ln, in!

637
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,700
- ln!
- Okay.

638
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,000
Get in!

639
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,500
- was holding on.
- You wanna give me a heart attack?

640
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,100
Did l scare you?

641
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,200
Why are we goin' to Dallas?

642
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,500
An associate of mine

643
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,700
has arranged a place
for us to stay for the night.

644
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,600
This Mary Ellen woman's
being very generous

645
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,800
to offer us her hospitality,

646
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,800
so l hope you will be
on your best behavior.

647
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,900
l'm always on my best behavior.

648
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,700
Sabrina and Toby, right?

649
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,100
l'm Mary Ellen.

650
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,600
Come on in.

651
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,200
l'm havin' a little get-together.

652
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,100
You two just come on in
and make yourselves at home.

653
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,800
Mary Ellen, come here.

654
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,600
Felicia's showing us
her new vagina.

655
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,200
l'm sorry.
They're feelin' a little feisty.

656
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,600
Everybody, this is Sabrina,

657
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,400
and her handsome
escort here is Toby.

658
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,600
- Hi.
- Hi.

659
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,900
How y'all?

660
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,500
Margaret said you were stealth.

661
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,400
l am in public,

662
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,100
but this is the privacy
of my own home.

663
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,900
Welcome to the first meetin'
of the gender pride

664
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:16,800
President's Day weekend
Caribbean cruise planning committee.

665
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,800
- We have to go.
- No.

666
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Where you guys know each other from?

667
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,400
We don't.

668
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,600
She's a friend of a friend....

669
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,100
of a friend.

670
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,700
There's rum punch in the kitchen
and guacamole in the dining room.

671
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,300
Yeah, don't be so uptight.
lt's a party.

672
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,400
Margaret told me you were plannin'
to have your surgery soon.

673
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,200
Toby doesn't know about me.

674
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,000
You're stealth to him?

675
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,100
Oh, sugar dumplin'!

676
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,100
Don't worry, honey.
We've all been there.

677
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,800
l'll pass the word.

678
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,500
lt was one of those
instant best friend things.

679
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,900
At the time, we were
both straight men.

680
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,500
What could you do with that?

681
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,300
We had our surgery on the same day.

682
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,600
We ended up holding hands
in the recovery room.

683
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:15,900
And now this gorgeous creature's
the love of my life.

684
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,100
We were just telling your friend

685
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,600
a little bit about
the transsexual lifestyle.

686
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,100
Mmm.

687
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:27,200
Not what you're
used to in church, huh?

688
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,300
These are vaginal dilators.

689
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,800
She just had her surgery last month.

690
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,500
This is Keanu two.

691
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,900
This is Keanu three.

692
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,000
Where's Keanu one?

693
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,400
Keanu one is in Hollywood
filming a major science-fiction epic,

694
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,200
and we don't want to hear
a snarky remark about him.

695
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,200
We're not gender-challenged,
we're gender-gifted.

696
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,300
l've been woman
and l've been man,

697
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,200
and l know more things
than you single-sex people

698
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,800
can even imagine.

699
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Dude, l thought you were a real guy.

700
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,300
We walk among you.

701
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:04,800
That poor thing couldn't pass
on a dark night at 200 yards.

702
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,500
ln the pink.

703
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:12,000
You better check your T-dar, honey.
She's a G.G.

704
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,000
- A what?
- A genuine girl.

705
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,100
From Mary Kay.

706
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:20,800
lf you let her do a color trial,
she'll give you a free compact.

707
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Oh, give me a home

708
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,200
Where the buffalo roam

709
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,600
And the deer
and the antelope play

710
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,100
With each other

711
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:38,100
Where seldom is heard

712
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,800
A discouraging word

713
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:47,500
And the skies
are not cloudy all day

714
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,200
Everybody!

715
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:55,100
Home, home on the range

716
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:00,900
Where the deer
and the antelope play

717
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,700
Where seldom is heard

718
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:07,900
A discouraging word

719
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,700
And the skies
are not cloudy all day

720
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,300
Oh!

721
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,800
Ah!

722
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,600
Sorry.

723
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,200
Could you hand me
my robe, please?

724
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,100
The pink satin.

725
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,100
lt's by the...

726
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,100
thank you.

727
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:45,700
lt's an unfortunate side effect
of my pills.

728
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,500
They're a diuretic.

729
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:50,900
Gross.

730
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,600
A diuretic.

731
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,600
lt means you go
number one, not number two.

732
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:02,500
Listen, l'm sorry about
those ersatz women.

733
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,500
What?

734
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,800
Ersatz.
lt means phony.

735
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,600
Something pretending to be
something it's not.

736
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,100
l thought they were nice.

737
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,200
Zoologists are the guys
that work in the zoos, right?

738
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,600
Yes, among other places.

739
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,400
l never met my real dad.

740
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,200
My mom never talked about him.

741
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,900
l'm gonna go
live with him, though.

742
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,200
As soon as l get enough money,

743
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,900
l can get some nice clothes,

744
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,800
and knock on his door, surprise him.

745
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:38,400
Do your mom and dad
live in California, too?

746
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:41,000
My parents are dead.

747
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,000
Do you like zoos?

748
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,800
l don't mind
the modern ones, l guess.

749
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,500
The animals may not be free,
but they're safe.

750
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,100
Yeah.
Me, too.

751
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,200
Night.

752
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,800
Good night.

753
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,600
- Did you go to college?
- Yes.

754
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:15,200
- What did you study?
- A lot of things.

755
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,900
French, cultural anthropology,

756
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,800
archaeology, psychology,
art history. Y uck.

757
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,400
Possum.

758
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,300
Biology.

759
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,800
80 million years ago
during the cretaceous period,

760
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,400
these plains were the floor
of a huge inland sea.

761
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,800
We there yet?

762
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,900
lf you don't wanna learn anything,
then never mind.

763
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,000
All right, l'm listening.

764
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:44,500
lt cut the entire continent in two.

765
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,700
Dinosaurs lived on either side.

766
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,300
Then a huge meteor struck the earth.

767
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,900
Some people say that's why
the dinosaurs went extinct,

768
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:56,600
but why should the insects,
birds and mammals have survived?

769
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,000
- Why?
- l don't know,

770
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,500
but it's always seemed
a little bit fishy to me.

771
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,500
Did you know they found
giant shark remains

772
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,000
in the middle of Kansas?

773
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,400
How big were they?

774
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,100
Big enough to swallow you
without even chewing.

775
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,100
- Got you.
- You did not.

776
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,500
- l got you.

777
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,200
Ah, you got me in the eye,
you got me in the eye.

778
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,500
l'm so sorry.
Did l hurt you?

779
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,800
Ha ha! Got you.

780
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,900
Ow!

781
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,800
Stop it.

782
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,800
Ow!

783
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,600
Seriously, watch the road.

784
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,200
You drive.

785
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,600
l hope we pass a rest stop soon.

786
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,400
My diuretic's kicking in.

787
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,100
Do rattlesnakes come out at night?

788
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,000
Well...

789
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,400
l must say, that's a relief.

790
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,300
Something wrong?

791
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,600
This is a no-smoking room.

792
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:46,000
New Mexico is
the ufology capital of the world.

793
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,100
Ufology.

794
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,600
From U.F.O.

795
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,000
The study of
unidentified flying objects.

796
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:58,500
You know, social ostracism
doesn't work in a community of two.

797
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,300
Damn it, Toby, say something.

798
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,200
l wanna go to Sammy's Wigwam.

799
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,100
Here's some arrowheads.

800
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,100
They're only a dollar each.

801
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,200
He's been acting like that all day.

802
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,600
Young man, if you don't
start behaving in a civilized fashion,

803
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,400
you and l are going to have
a very serious problem.

804
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,600
Fuck you.

805
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:33,100
Hey, you watch your mouth
around your mother.

806
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,100
She is not my mother!
She's not anyone's mother.

807
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,600
She's not even a real woman.

808
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,700
She's got a dick.

809
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,000
Don't you?!

810
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,100
Don't you?
Go on, tell him.

811
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,400
You're a fuckin' lying freak.

812
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,800
What do you want outta me?

813
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,900
Just because a person
doesn't go around

814
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,300
blabbing her entire biological history

815
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,500
to everyone she meets
doesn't make her a liar.

816
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,300
Why didn't you
just tell me the truth?

817
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,700
So you could humiliate me
in public even sooner?

818
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,400
You knew all about me.

819
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,300
Why did you bail me out of jail?

820
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:24,700
You just walked into jail,
asked 'em who needed help?

821
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,700
You know what, fuck you!

822
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,600
l never even heard of
a tranny church lady.

823
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,900
Just drop me off
in the next town.

824
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,200
So you don't think l have
the right to belong to a church?

825
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,600
My body may be a work in progress,

826
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,000
but there is nothing
wrong with my soul.

827
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,300
Jesus made me this way for a reason

828
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:53,000
so l could suffer and be reborn
the way he was.

829
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:56,200
So you're cutting
your dick off for Jesus?

830
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,800
You don't cut it off.

831
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,900
Just gonna have an inny
instead of an outie.

832
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:01,600
Eww.

833
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,400
Hi.
ls there any chance

834
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,900
that you could offer
a fellow traveler a ride?

835
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,700
Absolutely.

836
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,100
We love helping strangers.

837
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,600
Beef jerky?

838
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:18,800
Uh, no thanks.

839
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:19,900
l'm a level four vegan.

840
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,300
l don't eat anything
that casts a shadow,

841
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,700
but a little token of my appreciation.

842
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,200
Absolutely.

843
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:40,900
l'm sorry, but the secondary smoke
might render me unfit to drive.

844
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,700
She's cool, right?

845
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:46,800
She's not a she,
she's got a dick.

846
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,100
Toby!

847
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,400
For now, at least.

848
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,200
You're a guy?

849
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,600
l'm a transsexual woman.

850
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,400
Wow!

851
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,900
l think transsexuality
is a radically evolved state of being.

852
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,200
Hey, look.

853
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,700
Many societies throughout history

854
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,900
have honored and revered
transgendered people--

855
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,300
The Zulu, the Yoruba.

856
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,600
The Native Americans
called us two-spirit people.

857
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,600
Two spirits.
That's cool.

858
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,400
Tell him what they're
gonna do with your dick.

859
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,700
Then the settlers came.

860
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,900
They tended to murder us on sight.

861
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:29,300
The way the white man treated
the lndian was very deeply fucked up.

862
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,700
Yeah.

863
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,500
Are you sure you won't join us?

864
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:33,800
Come on.

865
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,700
We know what you got.

866
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,500
You boys go ahead.
Have fun.

867
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,500
So what do you do
when you're not following the open road?

868
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,400
l'm a Peyote shaman.

869
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,500
How do you do that?

870
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,100
lt involves consuming
majestic amounts of peyote.

871
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:02,800
When you're done throwing up,
you see things.

872
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:10,300
- What things?
- Once l saw my own death.

873
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,800
Do you by any chance
drown in a desert lake?

874
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,700
No. l die in
a depressurization accident

875
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,700
on a moon colony.

876
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,600
l'll show you something.

877
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,600
lt's in my bag.

878
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:33,300
Do you still think what you said
back at Sammy's Wigwam?

879
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,500
What?

880
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,700
That l'm a freak.

881
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,300
You're not a freak.

882
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,200
You're just a liar.

883
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,800
Oh, shit!

884
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,600
My purse!

885
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,800
My hormones!

886
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,000
You dirty motherfucker!

887
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:08,700
My dog book was in that car.

888
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,900
Oh.

889
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,600
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

890
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,600
My surgery.

891
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:28,800
l have to be in L.A. ln two days.
What are we going to do?

892
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,000
ls it soothing?

893
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,400
We could sell it.

894
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,200
How much could you get?

895
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:49,800
Oh, sweet.

896
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,300
Come on.
Let's go.

897
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,200
Oh!

898
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,900
Oh!

899
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:30,100
l don't care about the car.

900
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:33,300
l just need to get to Los Angeles
as quickly as possible.

901
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,200
l'm driving a couple of good ponies

902
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:37,900
over to the sale in Show Low
in the morning.

903
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,000
Could give you a ride that far.

904
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,500
Hey, Woodrow, can l get
a burger for the young lady here?

905
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:46,900
Yep.

906
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:12,600
lsn't Calvin an unusual name
for a Native American?

907
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,300
Not really.

908
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,600
My brothers names are Dwight, Lloyd,
Daryl and Woodrow.

909
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,200
What's your last name?

910
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,800
Many Goats.
lt's my mother's clan name.

911
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,100
Oh.
Matrilineal kinship system.

912
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,700
ls there a Mrs. Many Goats?

913
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,000
Oh, no.
No, not yet.

914
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,300
l guess the right woman
hasn't met me.

915
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,100
Oh!
There you are.

916
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,100
Calvin, l'd like
you to meet Toby.

917
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:46,400
- Toby, this is Calvin Many Coats.
- How you doin', son?

918
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:50,200
l saved you half a hamburger.

919
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,500
Calvin's offered us
a place to stay tonight

920
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:53,700
and a ride in the morning.

921
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,600
- lsn't that generous of him?
- Yes.

922
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:01,200
Oh.
Excuse me just a minute.

923
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,000
Yes, ma'am.

924
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:11,100
You-you already found a buyer?

925
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:16,700
At least now you don't have
any more of that damn drug.

926
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,900
Mm, shower.

927
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,700
So...

928
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:30,700
Calvin, have you spent all your life
in New Mexico?

929
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,200
Not yet.

930
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:33,200
Oh!

931
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,800
lt's beautiful.

932
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,500
lt's home.

933
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,200
Hi.

934
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,400
lt's Mescal.

935
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:19,600
Oh.

936
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:23,000
Friend of mine brings it up
from Oaxaca every year.

937
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,700
Beautiful dreamer

938
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,800
Wake unto me

939
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,100
Starlight and dewdrops
are waiting for thee

940
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:42,700
Sounds of the rude world

941
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:45,300
Heard in the day

942
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:50,100
Lulled by the moonlight
have all passed away

943
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,400
Beautiful dreamer

944
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:58,500
Queen of my song

945
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:03,700
List while l woo thee
with soft melody

946
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:09,300
Gone are the cares
of life's busy throng

947
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:13,900
Beautiful dreamer
awake unto me

948
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:17,200
Beautiful dreamer

949
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:20,600
Awake unto me

950
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,600
You can sing.

951
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,800
Oh, just enough to keep the dogs

952
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:30,700
off the back porch, that's all.

953
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,400
Have some more.

954
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Thank you.

955
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,000
That'll put hair on your chest.

956
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:50,400
l hope not.

957
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,500
Morning, sleepyhead.

958
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:14,900
Guess what.

959
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,500
Calvin's gonna drive us
all the way to Phoenix.

960
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:22,000
Do my breasts seem smaller to you?

961
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,500
l've missed two doses of my pills.

962
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,800
You play with the body's
hormonal balance,

963
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,600
and you're playing with fire.

964
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,800
Playing with fire.

965
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,100
Playing with fire.

966
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,700
When you wear your cowboy hat,

967
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:47,000
if you wear it forward like that,
that means you're lookin' for trouble.

968
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:50,000
lf you wear it back like that,
it means you're not lookin' for trouble.

969
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:51,600
lf you wear it off to the side,

970
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:54,400
it means you're out
to impress the ladies.

971
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:57,100
How come an lndian
wears a cowboy hat?

972
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,300
l guess because it keeps the sun
out of my eyes

973
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:02,500
better than a headband
and a couple of eagle feathers.

974
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:05,200
Calvin was telling me
that his people are Navajo.

975
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:06,700
Only part Navajo.

976
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:09,400
My great-great-great
great-grandfather was Zuni.

977
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:13,800
You got a Cherokee look about you.

978
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,300
Proud people, them Cherokee.

979
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,900
- Too young.
- No, l'm not.

980
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:42,800
Yes, you are.

981
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,300
Here.
Drink some water.

982
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,000
Now if you gentlemen will excuse me,

983
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,200
l have to... use the powder room.

984
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,500
Oh.

985
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,200
- Here.
- Thank you.

986
01:04:58,300 --> 01:04:59,500
- Allow me.
- Thank you.

987
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:02,700
- Oops!

988
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:10,200
Dude, there's things about her
she's not tellin' you.

989
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,800
Well,

990
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,100
every woman has a right
to a little mystery...dude.

991
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:18,200
You know she's a Jesus freak?

992
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:20,400
She's probably waitin' to convert you.

993
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,800
She can convert me
any time she wants to.

994
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:55,100
Well, l wish l could
drive you all the way to Los Angeles.

995
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:57,100
So do l.

996
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,000
Here, let me
get that for you.

997
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:01,400
lt's all right.

998
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,500
lt doesn't work
from the inside.

999
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:06,600
Sticks a bit.

1000
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:09,700
Thank you.

1001
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:13,500
Bree, there's some things
about me you don't know--

1002
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:14,900
Some things about my past.

1003
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,100
We all have our secrets.

1004
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:21,200
l been in jail more than once,

1005
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:23,100
l'm about blind in one eye,
and l got

1006
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,000
a half a pound of shrapnel
in my left leg.

1007
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:28,500
But if you're ever in New Mexico,

1008
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,000
l'd really like it
if you give me a call.

1009
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:34,100
Thank you, Calvin.
l'll do that.

1010
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,900
TOB Y:
Let's go.

1011
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,200
Come here.

1012
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,700
This used to belong
to a real good friend of mine.

1013
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:51,000
He was a champion
in the all-lndian rodeo circuit.

1014
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:52,900
Now you look like a warrior.

1015
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,600
Ma'am.

1016
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,700
Where are we?

1017
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,900
My parents' house.

1018
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:14,100
l thought you said
your parents were dead.

1019
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:17,000
Mmm.
Wishful thinking.

1020
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,600
Who's Sydney?

1021
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,500
My baby sister.
Go.

1022
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,000
May l help you?

1023
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,200
ls Sydney here?

1024
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:37,200
Sydney's out.

1025
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:39,000
May l tell her who called?

1026
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,500
l don't think so.

1027
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:55,900
Don't look at me that way.

1028
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:58,200
l'm not looking at you.

1029
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,100
All right, all right.

1030
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:06,200
Shit!

1031
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,000
l mean darn.

1032
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:09,400
No, l mean shit.

1033
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:20,000
May l help you, young lady?

1034
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:23,300
Dad, it's me.

1035
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:31,600
- Mom!

1036
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,200
Dad?

1037
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,500
Mom!

1038
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:40,600
Get in here before
the neighbors see you!

1039
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:46,300
Jesus Christ,
l can't even recognize you.

1040
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:49,100
lt's me, only different.

1041
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:51,700
So you've done it.

1042
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:53,500
lt's all over.

1043
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:56,000
l don't think that's
any of your business.

1044
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,300
Mom!

1045
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:00,700
Thank God, Murray.
He's still a boy.

1046
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:11,300
My poor Stanley.

1047
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,000
l can't look at you like this!

1048
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,300
Geez, why do you always
upset her like that?

1049
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:19,800
l tell you what.

1050
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,900
l'm just gonna get something
to eat and drink,

1051
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:25,700
and then l'll go back
and wait for Sydney outside.

1052
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:33,900
Are you sure
you're all right, Stanley?

1053
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:37,200
Fabulous.
Never been better.

1054
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:40,700
- Stanley...
- Bree.

1055
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:44,000
Sabrina Claire Osbourne.

1056
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:46,600
Look, we're gonna need
more time with that.

1057
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,000
Your mother and l
both love you--

1058
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,200
But we don't respect you.

1059
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:54,100
l'll never understand
why you're doing this to me.

1060
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:56,000
l'm not doing anything to you.

1061
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,900
l'm gender dysphoric.
lt's a genetic condition.

1062
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:02,100
Don't try to blame
your father and me for this.

1063
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:04,500
You shouldn't use
so much mayonnaise.

1064
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:08,000
Are you trying
to give yourself a heart attack?

1065
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,700
Let me do that!

1066
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,400
You know what l see
when l look at you?

1067
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:17,800
l see a lost soul
crying out for help.

1068
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:22,500
This would never have happened
if you had only come to church

1069
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:24,100
when you were little,

1070
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:27,500
instead of going off
to that synagogue of your father's.

1071
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:28,900
Mom, dad?

1072
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,400
There's a scruffy-looking kid outside.

1073
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,400
Holy shit!

1074
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:36,700
Language, Sydney!

1075
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,000
l don't fuckin' believe it!

1076
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:41,200
Stanley.

1077
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:43,200
Bree.

1078
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:47,600
Bree.

1079
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:50,200
Well, Bree, l was hopin'
you'd show up one of these days,

1080
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,000
take some of the heat off me.

1081
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:55,400
lt's nice to see you, too.

1082
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,900
lf that kid out there's your boyfriend,
l'm gonna slit my wrists.

1083
01:10:58,100 --> 01:10:59,700
l need to talk to you in private.

1084
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,500
Oh, my God.
He is!

1085
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,400
You lucky son of a--

1086
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,800
l mean, you lucky bitch.

1087
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,900
Your boyfriend?!

1088
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:09,600
That filthy teenage
juvenile delinquent

1089
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,200
who came to the door?

1090
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:14,600
He happens to be a clean,
healthy and respectable young man.

1091
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,400
l don't want to hear
any more about it.

1092
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,500
How old is he?

1093
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,900
Seventeen.

1094
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:24,400
Oh, my God!
Murray, he's underage.

1095
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:27,900
Mom, he's my son.

1096
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,300
You're shittin' me!

1097
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:35,500
- Remember Emma Wilkins?
- What are you saying?

1098
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:37,500
ls Emma here, too?

1099
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:39,200
She killed herself.

1100
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:40,300
Jesus!

1101
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,500
KineIhora.

1102
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,700
Are you trying to tell me

1103
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:48,100
that that boy
who came to the door...

1104
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:51,200
he's your grandson.

1105
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,400
My grandson.

1106
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:58,300
My grandson.

1107
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,300
Oh, dear God.

1108
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:05,000
He doesn't know anything,
and l don't want him to.

1109
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,700
Wait!

1110
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:12,800
- Call me grandpa.
- Shit!

1111
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,100
Oh, you poor thing.

1112
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:22,300
Get up off that filthy ground.
Get up!

1113
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:25,400
There could be
all sorts of awful things down there.

1114
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,100
Look at you.

1115
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:30,200
What a handsome boy.

1116
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:34,400
Do you know who l am?

1117
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,700
- l'm your--
- A friend. Bree's mother.

1118
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:38,800
He doesn't know
about me, do you understand?

1119
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,800
l don't want him
to know about me. Agreed?

1120
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:43,000
- You're not gonna say anything?
- No.

1121
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:44,600
Hi there.

1122
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:45,900
l'm Sydney.

1123
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,800
Hey. Toby.

1124
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,400
- What do you say?
- Toby.

1125
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:55,700
Come on inside
where there's nice air conditioning.

1126
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:57,100
Come on, honey,

1127
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,700
and l'll make you
a nice plate of food.

1128
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:06,800
Mm, defrosted to perfection.

1129
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,400
Finish your vegetables.

1130
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,000
He doesn't like broccoli.

1131
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,300
Open up.

1132
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:19,100
Lucky, no!

1133
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:21,300
l swear, that dog is a sex maniac!

1134
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:24,500
Just like your father.

1135
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,700
At least he gets
more action than l do.

1136
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:29,200
My mom used to live
in Phoenix before l was born.

1137
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:33,500
Really?
What a coincidence.

1138
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:36,300
What did your name used to be
when you were a guy?

1139
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,700
Honey, why don't you go
and watch TV

1140
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:42,700
in the spare bedroom, hmm?

1141
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,800
You can take the dog.

1142
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:48,600
Come here.
Come here, boy.

1143
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Stanley, what are you
planning to do

1144
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:55,800
with that poor boy?

1145
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,400
First of all, l'm gonna make sure

1146
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:01,700
he knows that he's encouraged
and supported.

1147
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:05,900
And that he's respected.

1148
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:09,000
Maybe even...

1149
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:12,200
well, at least that he's respected.

1150
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:20,500
Behold the return
of the Prodigal son.

1151
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:24,300
Can we try to be nice
to each other, please?

1152
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,500
This is so bizarre.

1153
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:29,200
l can still see Stanley in you,

1154
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,700
but it's like you put yourself
through a strainer

1155
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,700
and got rid of all the boy pulp.

1156
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:41,000
Planning a game
of bridge with the girls?

1157
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,500
Hmm.

1158
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:50,200
Can l borrow $1 ,000?

1159
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,200
You've gotta be kidding.

1160
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,400
500?

1161
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:56,700
250?

1162
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:58,300
Do l hear a dollar and a half?

1163
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:01,200
l have to account for every penny.

1164
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,200
Eighteen months sober,

1165
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:05,600
and they're still
scared shitless l'm gonna relapse

1166
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:09,700
and wind up passed out on the floor
in some dive down on Van Buren.

1167
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,200
God, those were the days.

1168
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,100
My surgery's day after tomorrow.

1169
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,600
l need air fare to get home.

1170
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:23,900
You know, growin' up,

1171
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:26,600
l always thought
you were the lucky one.

1172
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,600
Hmm.

1173
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,400
Try this one.

1174
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:32,700
Oh, my God.

1175
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:36,300
lt'll be like showgirls, um...
on lce Capades.

1176
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,900
l'm a transsexual,
not a transvestite.

1177
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,600
Yeah, but it will really
freak Mom out.

1178
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:44,000
Now you've lost all credibility.

1179
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:16,900
Toby, don't break that, honey.
lt's very expensive.

1180
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:21,400
Murray, l just hate the way
you had Lucky's tail clipped.

1181
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:24,700
Stands straight up just like a penis.

1182
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,400
- Black and hairy.
- Well, it does.

1183
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,700
Not like any penis l've ever seen.

1184
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,700
Me neither.

1185
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:33,100
Toby!

1186
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,600
Toby, come over here
and let me fix your hair.

1187
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:36,900
Come on.

1188
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:39,000
Come on, honey.

1189
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:42,700
Stay.

1190
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:44,800
Sit.

1191
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,700
Oh, you have such
nice, thick hair.

1192
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:51,200
Just like mine.

1193
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:54,700
And those clothes
are a great improvement.

1194
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:56,200
They fit good, huh?

1195
01:16:56,300 --> 01:16:59,500
- They fit well.
- Grammar police.

1196
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:02,400
Good evening.

1197
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:12,300
That dress looks
perfectly ridiculous.

1198
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,000
You're looking
very handsome.

1199
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,700
You look good, too.

1200
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:29,800
Beauty is relative.

1201
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:31,600
For God's sake, Mom!

1202
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:35,000
Oh, don't pick on me, not tonight.
l can't take it.

1203
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
l used to read pornography
on the toilet,

1204
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:49,900
and ever since,
l have shitty sex.

1205
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:53,700
You get it?

1206
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:54,800
Yeah.

1207
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:11,600
Thank you.

1208
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:16,200
Toby, come and sit here next to me.

1209
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:18,200
Here, take a picture.

1210
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:22,800
Murray, scoot over.
Come on, honey. Right here.

1211
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,500
That's right, Toby honey.

1212
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:27,600
Lean in close, honey.
All right, everybody.

1213
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,600
One, two, three.

1214
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,300
We all look much happier
than we really are.

1215
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,800
Can you take one
of the two of us?

1216
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:40,700
l'll take it.

1217
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:58,800
Nice to see a young man
being so polite to his mother.

1218
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,000
That's not his mother.

1219
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,000
And, uh, a hamburger

1220
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:11,300
for the young gentleman.

1221
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:12,500
Enjoy your meal.

1222
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:22,300
Toby, do you want to say grace?

1223
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:24,700
Go ahead, honey.
Don't be shy.

1224
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:39,300
Uh, God,
bless this restaurant and, uh...

1225
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:42,400
these thy gifts that we're
about to receive forever

1226
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,400
and ever.

1227
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:47,500
And thank you, Lord,
for bringing Toby to us.

1228
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:53,000
And please let us all stay together
in health and spirits.

1229
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:55,000
ln Jesus Christ's name.
Amen.

1230
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:56,100
Amen.

1231
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,400
SIhalom Israel.

1232
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:03,300
Jesus!

1233
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,200
Oh, Toby, honey,

1234
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,800
don't take the lettuce
out of your hamburger.

1235
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,400
lt's good for you.

1236
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,900
Sydney, don't play with your food.

1237
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:17,200
Sieg Iheil.

1238
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:27,600
Can l borrow $1 ,000?

1239
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:30,900
Toby, your hamburger's almost raw.

1240
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:32,600
Let me send that back.

1241
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:34,800
l can pay it back with interest.

1242
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,900
What do you need the money for?

1243
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
To get back to Los Angeles.

1244
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:40,600
Look at your life.

1245
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:43,100
You've never been able
to stick to a decision.

1246
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:46,400
Ten years of college,
and not a single degree.

1247
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:49,300
How do you know you won't change
your mind about this, too?

1248
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:54,800
Because l know.

1249
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:01,200
Don't do this awful thing
to yourself. Please.

1250
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,100
l miss my son.

1251
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:08,900
Mom...

1252
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,100
you never had a son.

1253
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:17,500
How can you say such a thing?

1254
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:20,200
Now you know how l felt
when you hired those private detectives.

1255
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:23,300
We only tried to do the best for you.

1256
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,100
ls that why you tried
to have me committed?

1257
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:26,900
You tried to kill yourself!

1258
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,500
Because you tried
to have me committed!

1259
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,200
l don't know why
you have to be so emotional.

1260
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,600
l am not emotional!

1261
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:35,900
God, my cycle's all out of whack.

1262
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,600
You don't have cycles.

1263
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:41,400
Hormones are hormones.

1264
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,900
Yours and mine just happen
to come in little purple pills.

1265
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:49,000
Young man, may we get
some doggie bags here, please?

1266
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:50,100
Yes, ma'am.

1267
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:53,500
l'm going to finish
cooking his hamburger at home.

1268
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:57,700
Murray, give me your wallet.

1269
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:04,900
Here's $200.

1270
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:07,900
We'll get the rest out of the safe.

1271
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:09,600
There's one condition.

1272
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:12,300
l want Toby to stay here with me.

1273
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,100
Wouldn't you like that, honey?

1274
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:19,400
You could have
your own little apartment.

1275
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:22,100
We'll remodel the guest house.

1276
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:24,200
Do you like to play tennis?

1277
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,600
We have eight new courts
at the country club.

1278
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:32,400
Murray and l just feel that
you need a stable, loving family

1279
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:37,400
with the means to give you
every chance that you deserve.

1280
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:51,400
Toby, here you are, baby.

1281
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,000
Ha ha ha!

1282
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:12,200
Half ltalian villa,
half country club.

1283
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:17,700
Beauty is relative.

1284
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,500
Not my relatives.

1285
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:25,300
l wish just once they'd
look at me and see me.

1286
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,600
That's all.

1287
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:30,000
Just really see me.

1288
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:33,200
Why are they bein' so nice to me?

1289
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:37,300
Mmm.

1290
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,200
You think l oughta stay here?

1291
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:43,000
Do you want to?

1292
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,100
lt's pretty nice.

1293
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:52,600
l think you oughta do whatever
you think is best for you.

1294
01:23:55,300 --> 01:24:02,600
But if you want,
you can come and live with me.

1295
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:06,500
l can't give you anything like this,

1296
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:09,100
but l'm sure
we could manage something.

1297
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:13,000
Did you really try to kill yourself?

1298
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:16,400
l swallowed half a bottle of Nembutal.

1299
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:22,700
Then l panicked and called 91 1 .

1300
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:27,800
Maybe you're not the suicidal type.

1301
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:29,200
Maybe.

1302
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:34,600
Unless my mother is right,
and l just can't stick to a decision.

1303
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:45,900
- Come in.

1304
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,200
Can't you sleep?

1305
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,800
- Not really.
- Do you need something?

1306
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,500
A glass of milk?

1307
01:24:57,700 --> 01:24:59,300
No.

1308
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:02,000
What is it?

1309
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:05,300
l must look awful.

1310
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,400
You look good.

1311
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,700
You look well.

1312
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:23,000
Don't worry.

1313
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,300
What are you doin'?

1314
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,000
What l'm good at.

1315
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:34,500
No, no.

1316
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:37,500
lt's okay.
l want to.

1317
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:39,900
You'll like it, l promise.

1318
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:42,100
l don't wanna like it.
l don't want it at all.

1319
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:45,600
Okay.

1320
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:53,700
l'll marry you if you want.

1321
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:58,500
l don't care how big your place is.
l just wanna be with you.

1322
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:02,800
l think you're sexy, Bree.

1323
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:05,300
lt's like...

1324
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,600
like l see you.

1325
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,200
Oh, God.

1326
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,200
Oh, no.
Put your clothes on.

1327
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:23,100
l mean it.
Right now. Stop it.

1328
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:24,400
What's the matter?

1329
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:27,000
Just...would you please
just cover yourself up?!

1330
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,500
- l am such a total shit.
- No, you're not.

1331
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:43,400
There's something l should've
told you a long time ago.

1332
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:45,000
You're going to hate me.

1333
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:47,900
l'm not really...

1334
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,900
exactly...

1335
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,700
affiliated with a church.

1336
01:26:57,700 --> 01:27:00,000
l already figured that out.

1337
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:06,600
What?

1338
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:09,300
My mom and dad.

1339
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:12,700
lt's your mom...

1340
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:14,600
and me.

1341
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:20,800
Toby...

1342
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:26,600
l'm so sorry.

1343
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,300
l know l shouldn't have lied to you.

1344
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:31,800
l know how disappointed you must be.

1345
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,700
A one-bedroom apartment
instead of a mansion,

1346
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:38,900
and half-Jewish
instead of half-lndian.

1347
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:40,500
Toby.

1348
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:43,300
Toby.

1349
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,600
Why don't we look on the bright side?

1350
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:47,400
We've gotten to know each other--

1351
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,500
Our strengths and weaknesses--

1352
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:51,800
And we're still
good friends, aren't we?

1353
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,700
l'm so sorry!

1354
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:56,100
l truly, really,
l didn't mean to hurt you!

1355
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:59,100
My mother's probably right.
l'm a terrible influence.

1356
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,800
Oh, please, this is
a terrible time for me.

1357
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:03,200
Toby, wait.

1358
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,800
Oh!

1359
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,500
You are not my father.

1360
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:08,800
Oh, my God!

1361
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:10,100
Oh, honey.

1362
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:11,300
There, there.

1363
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:12,700
He didn't mean it, honey.

1364
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:15,300
He's just a little bit upset.

1365
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:16,500
There now.

1366
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:17,900
There, there.

1367
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,500
There, there.

1368
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,100
Toby's gone!

1369
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:39,300
He took my purse...

1370
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:41,600
and my bucking bronco statue.

1371
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,600
What do you want to do, Sta--

1372
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:56,000
Bree.

1373
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,100
Yes.

1374
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:00,100
He's 17, but you don't know

1375
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:01,300
his date of birth?

1376
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:03,400
What's your
relationship to the missing boy?

1377
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:08,200
l am his father.

1378
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,400
Can't you put out an A.P.B.
or something?

1379
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:12,200
We'll do our best.

1380
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:14,600
l'm sorry to say this,
but chances are,

1381
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:16,500
if he doesn't wanna be found,

1382
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:19,000
he's gonna stay lost.

1383
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:46,700
lt's okay

1384
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:50,800
You don't have to be afraid

1385
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,800
There's nothin' to worry about

1386
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,300
'Cause we got it made

1387
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:04,600
lt's just a simple matter of

1388
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:08,400
Letting me into your love

1389
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:12,400
lf you let that feeling
come over you

1390
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:16,500
Then there's nothin' more
that you can do

1391
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:20,900
Just let it go

1392
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,100
Let it go

1393
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:27,900
Hey.

1394
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,400
This is Bree.

1395
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:38,200
lf it's love you want

1396
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:40,100
Hold out your arms

1397
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:42,200
Thank you very much.

1398
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:46,000
lt's all right here

1399
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:50,200
lt's safe and warm

1400
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:56,100
lt's okay to feel good

1401
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:57,600
Everything is fine.

1402
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:59,700
Your surgery was
a complete success.

1403
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:04,300
Everything we have
is fresh and new

1404
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:08,600
l will open myself up to you

1405
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:12,600
Like a rose

1406
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,800
Like a rose

1407
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:34,100
Hello, my lady.

1408
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:38,800
How are you feeling?

1409
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:42,400
And don't say like a new woman.

1410
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:44,700
l...

1411
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:48,700
feel like a medieval heretic

1412
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:55,600
impaled on a very large
and very thick...

1413
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,200
stake...

1414
01:31:58,300 --> 01:31:59,900
with splinters.

1415
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,900
Nice hat.

1416
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:09,400
lt was a present.

1417
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,100
Bree, why do l get the feeling

1418
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,400
that there's something
not quite right?

1419
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:18,700
Last week, you said

1420
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:20,900
this was gonna be
the happiest day of your life.

1421
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:23,700
Last week was a long time ago.

1422
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:32,500
Talk to me.

1423
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:39,300
l fucked up.

1424
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:57,000
lt hurts.

1425
01:32:57,100 --> 01:32:59,200
Oh!
Oh, my sweetie.

1426
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:03,600
That's what hearts do.

1427
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:15,300
lt's okay.

1428
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:16,700
Okay.

1429
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:18,100
Okay.

1430
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:24,900
l'm sorry.

1431
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:26,700
No, let it out.

1432
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:29,000
This is good, Bree.

1433
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:30,500
This is good.

1434
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:46,400
Amo la comida mexicana.

1435
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:48,800
Amo la comida mexicana.

1436
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,300
Y amo Fernando.

1437
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:54,800
Amo la comida mexicano.

1438
01:34:55,100 --> 01:34:56,900
Mexicana.

1439
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:04,000
School's gonna be closing
in about 1 5 minutes.

1440
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:05,700
Wayne, this is really hard.

1441
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:07,600
Do you think
you could give me a hand?

1442
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:09,400
Sure.
What subject?

1443
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:11,600
Sex education.

1444
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:16,500
All right, cut.

1445
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:18,600
He needs help again.

1446
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:19,800
Let's go, let's go.

1447
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:23,100
Did you take your Viagra?

1448
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:25,000
Yes, ma'am.

1449
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:26,600
When's the last time you came?

1450
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:27,900
Like two hours ago.

1451
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:30,000
Christ, kid.

1452
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,400
You've got to focus, okay?
Can you focus?

1453
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:35,400
We're behind schedule.
We've gotta move.

1454
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:40,800
Ow.

1455
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,000
Toby.

1456
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:00,200
Don't think that l'm
fucking forgiving you,

1457
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:01,800
because l'm not.

1458
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:05,700
All right.

1459
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:13,000
- l just came over to see if you did it.
- Did what?

1460
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:15,900
Got your dick turned inside out.

1461
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,500
Yes.

1462
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:19,400
Won't you come in?

1463
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:21,600
Just for a little while?

1464
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:25,900
- l have something for you.
- What?

1465
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:28,300
Please.

1466
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:42,800
Your parents' house is a lot nicer.

1467
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,000
My parents' house
comes with my parents.

1468
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:50,600
l thought you said we were Jewish.

1469
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:52,200
Half-Jewish...

1470
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,200
through my father,
so it's technically the wrong half,

1471
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:56,800
and you're only a quarter.

1472
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:58,200
The wrong quarter.

1473
01:36:58,300 --> 01:37:02,500
l'm gonna finish up my degree.

1474
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:05,100
l thought l'd take up teaching.

1475
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:07,300
Maybe rent a house someplace.

1476
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:09,700
Someplace with a yard.

1477
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:12,100
What have you got for me?

1478
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,300
Hang on a minute.

1479
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:18,000
l've missed you.

1480
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:21,400
Have a seat.

1481
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:26,700
So how have you been?

1482
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,700
l've been all right.

1483
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:35,700
Would you care to divulge
a few more details?

1484
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,400
- l'm making a movie.
- You are?

1485
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:41,300
Told you l could.

1486
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:43,600
They're already doin'
the advertisement for it.

1487
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:46,600
- Here.
- Oh.

1488
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:53,200
''Cowabunghole.''

1489
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:55,500
That's Dylan Reeves.

1490
01:37:55,700 --> 01:37:57,300
He's a big star.

1491
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:59,800
Huh.

1492
01:37:59,900 --> 01:38:01,000
And there's you.

lf you want, l could get you
a discount when it comes out.

1496
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:13,000
Thank you.
That's very considerate.

1497

at the Beverly Center.

1498
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:21,000
Beverly Hills.

1499
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:33,500
Would you like a coke?

1500
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:37,800
l'll take a beer.

1501
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:41,500
All right.

1502
01:38:50,900 --> 01:38:54,000
Young man, if you think
you can put your dirty tennis shoes

1503
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:55,800
on my brand-new coffee table,

1504
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,100
you're gonna have to think again.

1505
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:31,500
THE END
