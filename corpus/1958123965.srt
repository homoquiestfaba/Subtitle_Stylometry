00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,718
What about the girl who drove off the highway?

361
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:15,487
What about her?

362
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,923
She drove off the road and got knocked

363
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,591
semi-unconscious and wandered off

364
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,659
through the woods in a daze.

365
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:23,261
And her car?

366
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,496
Like they said, some animal.

367
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:26,398
Yeah, right, an animal.

368
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:29,034
Like a bunny rabbit, or raccoon, or an anteater.

369
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:33,271
No, l bet you up some giant grizzly bear devoured her

370
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,506
and then bashed in her car.

371
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:38,043
- Are there bears around here? - No, there are not.

372
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:39,611
No seriously!

373
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:43,215
What if one escaped from a zoo or a circus?

374
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:45,750
[everyone laughing]

375
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,052
What's so funny?

376
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,354
l could just see this great big bear

377
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:51,823
out on the front lawn with a little red hat and booties doing flips and headstands.

378
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:53,492
We maybe it's not trained.

379
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,827
[Jim] Well then l guess it falls down a lot whenever it tries to do a headstand.

380
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,863
[everyone laughing]

381
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:58,697
[Nick] You're right.

382
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,667
[ominous music]

383
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:15,113
All right, so, what do you think happened?

384
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:16,748
I'm still going back and forth.

385
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:18,383
It could be an ax murderer and an alien from outer space.

386
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,019
You're serious.

387
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:22,888
You really think there's something out there

388
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:24,489
waiting to kill us?

389
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,557
[loud clanking]

390
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,528
No, now it may be inside.

391
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,496
That came from the kitchen.

392
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:33,732
What if there is a bear?

393
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:35,567
[Nick] There isn't any bears!

394
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,636
- I'm gonna go check it out. - I'll go with ya.

395
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:38,970
Yeah, I'll stay here with the girls.

396
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:40,805
No thanks, I'll join you.

397
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,374
[Janet and David] Wait for us.

398
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:44,242
Wait a second, this is stupid. We're not a gonna go look.

399
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,578
What if it is a bear?

400
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:47,612
[Nick] It isn't a bear!

401
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,020
Look, see, no bear!

402
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,254
A pan fell off the counter.

403
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:59,291
That's where the rest of the chicken was.

404
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,293
[everyone] Ew.

405
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,766
What is all this green stuff all over the pan?

406
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,501
l thought that chicken tasted kind of funny.

407
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:11,069
Yeah, no more dinner for me.

408
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:12,237
I'll pass on seconds, really, thank you.

409
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:14,806
Thanks a lot, Nick.

410
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,808
Well, l didn't mean anything.

411
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,043
Look, it's there.

412
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,411
[Mike] Okay, so the chicken went away.

413
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:21,580
Now, are we going to assume it just threw up

414
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:23,081
some green slime and walked away,

415
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:24,482
or are we going to do the intelligent thing

416
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,585
and bolt and lock the windows and doors?

417
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,820
Mike's right, we should lock the place up.

418
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:31,823
What if it is a bear?

419
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,125
Ugh!

420
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,427
l got to get out of here.

421
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:37,295
Stace, you wanna go for a walk?

422
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,165
No, thanks. l have to clean up my green chicken.

423
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:42,834
What, you're mad at me now?

424
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:44,736
Just do your own cooking from now on.

425
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:49,441
So, are we having a good time?

426
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,142
- [Doreen] Mm-hm. - What next?

427
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:53,211
[Jim and Doreen giggling]

428
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,280
Would you like to go walk outside with me, David?

429
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:57,015
l think it's getting a little dark out.

430
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:58,483
You're right, it's very dark out.

431
00:26:58,516 --> 00:26:59,884
It's getting really dark, you better not go.

432
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:01,920
It's not safe. It's not safe.

433
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,722
I'm sure you can get a flashlight.

434
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,457
Nope, no flashlights. Look, you don't have one, l don't have one,

435
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,258
they don't have one. There's none in the house.

436
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,693
- I'm sorry it's just-- - I brought my pen flashlight.

437
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:10,996
That makes sense.

438
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,332
You're actually going.

439
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,101
You're actually going outside.

440
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:18,503
We've had warnings, murder attempts,

441
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:20,438
and you're going out for a walk in the woods.

442
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,874
l don't actually call a disappearing raw chicken a murder attempt.

443
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,243
- Well, l do. - l heard that.

444
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,687
So, what about you two?

445
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:40,725
How about a nice dip in the pond?

446
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,229
[loud clanking]

447
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:46,898
I'm sorry, all right?

448
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:48,867
I'm sorry, l didn't mean it.

449
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:53,538
It's not that, it's your friend, Mike.

450
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:55,640
- He's driving me crazy. - Shh.

451
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,275
He's going to ruin the whole vacation.

452
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:59,577
No, he's not, he's gonna help keep it from getting boring.

453
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,981
Come on, he's a really nice guy once you get to know him.

454
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,683
l don't want to get to know him.

455
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:06,985
l fee sorry for those who know him.

456
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,486
Nick, he has no life.

457
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,155
He likes to watch horror films, all right?

458
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,990
He is a horror film.

459
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,925
A walking, talking horror film.

460
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:19,097
You never know, one might come in handy.

461
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:24,302
[David] Can you believe Mike?

462
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,337
l mean, talk about overreacting over nothing.

463
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,873
Forget him.

464
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:32,877
l want to tell story l recently heard.

465
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:36,314
It's supposed to be a horror story or something like that.

466
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:38,349
Well, we got the right location for it.

467
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,385
[ominous music]

468
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:42,187
[Janet] It's not intelligent.

469
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,788
l didn't think it would be, but go ahead.

470
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:47,559
Okay, there were these two--two teenagers

471
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:51,629
out on a date, they drove into the woods to make out.

472
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:53,832
You mean intercourse.

473
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:55,600
Right.

474
00:28:58,536 --> 00:28:59,738
They park by the road

475
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:01,873
and they packed a blanket,

476
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,174
they laid it out in an open field.

477
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,144
They start to get undressed

478
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:08,446
until they noticed that something was watching them.

479
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,582
They were too preoccupied?

480
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,050
[Janet] Right.

481
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,985
They just started to notice this.

482
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:17,188
And it start to approach them.

483
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,290
They were rolling around in the grass

484
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:21,025
and this thing got closer and closer.

485
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,294
Wait a second.

486
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,163
You mean to tell me that these two idiots

487
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:27,031
wouldn't notice a monster if it was right on top of them?

488
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:29,934
l told you it wasn't a realistic story.

489
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:32,837
So suddenly the girl open her eyes.

490
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,040
Oh, she'd been in too much [indistinct], right?

491
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:37,242
Whatever.

492
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,943
[dramatic music]

493
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:41,012
[screaming] Are you all right?

494
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,115
Damn fallen branch.

495
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:46,618
Where did the flashlight go?

496
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:49,020
Behind those bushes.

497
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,261
Oh wait, l think l see it. No, that's not it.

498
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:57,929
l think l see t.

499
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:01,132
So how does this story end?

500
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,036
Oh, it kills them.

501
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:10,475
l got it!

502
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:11,876
Ooh, l think l stepped on something.

503
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:12,911
Like what?

504
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:19,317
- [both screaming] - [fast-paced music]

505
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:26,057
[monster screeching]

506
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,929
[thuds]

507
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,372
Mike, l don't want to get rough.

508
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:16,074
We're going for a swim.

509
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:18,176
Why don't you put a sign on your chest that says, "victim"?

510
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,878
Come on, use your brains for a second.

511
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:21,846
David and Janet haven't made it back yet.

512
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,314
They've been gone 10 minutes

513
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:24,782
and they can take care of themselves.

514
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:27,385
Oh sure, I'd call a penlight enough protection against anything.

515
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:30,154
Okay then, after our swim we'll go look for them.

516
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:31,890
- Good? - Fine, you're gonna make one major [Censored] up,

517
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:33,191
why not go all the way?

518
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,059
Hey Doreen, what about the bear?

519
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,128
- That's right, Jim, what if there's a-- - [Jim] Shut up, Mike!

520
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:38,963
There--there are no big animals out there, Doreen.

521
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,064
And we're going for a swim.

522
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,533
Big animals hate the water.

523
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,069
- Not sharks. - Are there sharks? Sharks?

524
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:46,604
- Goodbye, Mike! - Did somebody say sharks?

525
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,885
- Nick. - Don't say anything, would you?

526
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,353
l just got her calmed down.

527
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:03,788
Now we're gonna go to bed, all right? Goodnight.

528
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:05,123
- But, Nick-- - Goodnight.

529
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,493
Guard the house, ol' buddy.

530
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,361
I'll see you tomorrow.

531
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:14,165
I'm al alone.

532
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:17,268
I'm all alone.

533
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,570
Holy [Censored].

534
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:23,007
[fast-paced music]

535
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:27,712
[indistinct singing]

536
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,029

You can't lock him down there all night.

Oh, [Censored].

772

Revenge.

Mike's revenge.

789
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:23,286
Come on, we lock him up,

790
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,322
so he destroys the pipes

791
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:26,790
and starts his little game.

792
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,526

793
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:31,695
gets David and Janet to join along,

794
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:35,332
and now we're supposed to be all scared and worried

795
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:36,833
until they jump out and say, "Boo."

796
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,140
All right, if that's the way they're gonna play it then--

797
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:44,975
- We ignore them. - Yeah, right.

798

Except now l have drive into town and get those pipes fixed.

799

And I'm not paying for this.

800

00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,115
but I'll tell you from experience,

900
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:47,750
it's a most a ways impossible to leave.

901
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:49,586
What do you mean almost always?

902
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:50,887
ln all the movies.

903
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,323
For crying out loud, will you stop it?

904
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:57,894
Look, we are talking about reality here, not make-believe.

905
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:00,496
Well, let me tell you something, that creature out there is not reality!

906
01:00:00,997 --> 01:00:02,765
[Stacy] So you're saying we're in a movie.

907
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:05,835
It's a distinct possibility.

908
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:09,606
What has happened to Jim?

909
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:11,274
His skin's turning into Silly Putty.

910
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:14,243
That thing pumped tons of that green chicken slime into him.

911
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:16,779
[Stacy] You know, what is that stuff?

912
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:18,314
It was on the chicken pan.

913
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:20,917
l found some on the pond this morning,

914
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,619
Nick found some on the rake outside now.

915
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:24,220
But it's not all over the house.

916
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:27,090
Eating.

917
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:28,925
That's it, it must have been after you

918
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,393
and Jim in the pond last night.

919
01:00:30,426 --> 01:00:32,295
That stuff has got to be part of its digestive system.

920
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:34,931
Well, you know, people have saliva to break down food,

921
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,933
this thing must have green slime.

922
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:40,503
So it must have been getting Jim ready for...lunch.

923
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,672
- Oh, god. - [Mike] Making his insides juicier.

924
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:45,108
Shut up, shut up!

925
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,310
You're disgusting!

926
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:49,278
Well, we have to figure this thing out if we're gonna kill it!

927
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:51,247
And the next question is why didn't it slime you two?

928
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:54,484
[birds chirp ng]

929
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:11,968
What are you talk ng about?

930
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:14,203
Well, when it attacked me, l noticed some of the slime.

931
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:16,906
It pumped Jim with it.

932
01:01:16,939 --> 01:01:19,208
But when it attacked you and pulled you into the basement last night, no slime.

933
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:22,211
It just had both of you in the hall a minute ago, no slime.

934
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:24,547
So maybe it wants you for something else.

935
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:25,882
Like what?

936
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:29,585
Reproduction.

937
01:01:30,586 --> 01:01:33,089
Oh, no, that's sick.

938
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:34,791
Actually, it did seem like it was trying--

939
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:36,426
What are we talk ng about here?

940
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:38,361
Those things that pop out of your stomach

941
01:01:38,394 --> 01:01:39,829
when you least expect it?

942
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,798
Yes, yes, that's it! You've seen some of these too!

943
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:43,800
But that means there could be more than one by now.

944
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:45,902
The girl who drove off the road two days ago.

945
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:49,072
Oh hell, there could have been an army of Girl Scouts on a nature walk.

946
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:50,807
There might be hundreds of them.

947
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,176
Where's Janet? What has happened to Janet?

948
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,544
Janet, where's Janet?

949
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:55,912
[Janet] Help!

950
01:01:55,945 --> 01:01:57,880
Somebody help me!

951
01:01:58,581 --> 01:02:00,283
Help me!

952
01:02:00,316 --> 01:02:01,551
Somebody help me!

953
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:04,887
We've got to warn her! Why won't this open?

954
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:07,824
Because l nailed it shut yesterday.

955
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:09,592
Well then get something! Smash it!

956
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:11,761
All right, fine, look out.

957
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:16,966
[glass shattering]

958
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:21,104
Are you try ng to kill me?

959
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:22,772
Janet, get away from the house!

960
01:02:22,805 --> 01:02:24,006
There's something here!

961
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:25,575
l can't!

962
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:27,443
l can't walk!

963
01:02:30,012 --> 01:02:31,814
Janet, get up!

964
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:33,950
We've got to get to her before that thing does.

965
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:35,351
That thing may have already gotten to her.

966
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:37,587
We don't know that. We've got to help her!

967
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:38,988
We don't know anything about that creature

968
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:40,289
except it, like everyone else,

969
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:41,858
hates a mouth full of shaving cream!

970
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:43,860
Then grab the bottle and let's go.

971
01:02:43,893 --> 01:02:45,862
We don't have any chance in this condition!

972
01:02:45,895 --> 01:02:47,830
- I'm going. - Me too!

973
01:02:52,335 --> 01:02:54,270
Great, this thing's gonna have itself an orgy.

974
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:02,979
- l don't see it. - l don't see it.

975
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:04,580
- It's okay. - It's okay.

976
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:05,615
- Let's go. - Let's go.

977
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:15,191
What creature?

978
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:18,494
David's dead.

979
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:20,496
[Doreen] Don't worry, Janet, we've got you.

980
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:23,699
[Janet crying]

981
01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:34,877
Now where are you going? We have to get her upstairs!

982
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:44,887
[dramatic music]

983
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:46,055
- What the--? - [ominous music]

984
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:50,860
[glass shattering]

985
01:03:51,761 --> 01:03:52,862
[groans]

986
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:56,866
Doreen, Doreen snap out of it!

987
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:04,674
[growling]

988
01:04:04,707 --> 01:04:07,443
[Janet screaming]

989
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:24,060
[screaming, growling continue]

990
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:49,151
[music continues]

991
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:54,490
[screaming, growling continue]

992
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:06,135
[Stacy screaming]

993
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:09,906
[Mike] Need a shave, you son of a [Censored]?

994
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:12,575
[monster screeching]

995
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:19,749
[ominous music]

996
01:05:24,153 --> 01:05:25,154
[indistinct], huh?

997
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:28,791
[suspenseful music]

998
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:40,002
[glass shattering]

999
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,947
[somber music]

1000
01:05:56,752 --> 01:05:59,055
Well l guess that'll teach her not to start with you again.

1001
01:05:59,655 --> 01:06:01,190
Punishment seems a little strict, but what do l know?

1002
01:06:02,591 --> 01:06:04,193
l had to!

1003
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:06,028
It was controlling her!

1004
01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:08,464
It shot green rays from its eyes and l looked away!

1005
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:11,667
l guess Doreen didn't.

1006
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:16,605
Okay, so if you look into its eyes

1007
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,607
during a green ray, it can control your mind

1008
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,209
when it wants to.

1009
01:06:20,242 --> 01:06:22,411
Oh wonderful, this thing hasn't missed a trick.

1010
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:24,880
Controls minds, eats people, reproduces.

1011
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:27,116
The car.

1012
01:06:27,516 --> 01:06:28,751
We can leave in the car!

1013
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:31,087
[mouthing words]

1014
01:06:39,695 --> 01:06:40,863
Where's the car?

1015
01:06:40,896 --> 01:06:42,231
Nick took it to town to get the plumber.

1016
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:47,636
Well, that was a stupid thing to do!

1017
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:49,505
[laughs] Plumber!

1018
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:52,108
Sure, gotta get those pipes fixed!

1019
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:53,409
l mean, we're just dying around here.

1020
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,613
[sighs] All right, think.

1021
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:00,850
It went up to the roof,

1022
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:03,719
we go to the basement.

1023
01:07:04,053 --> 01:07:05,287
Come on, get some flashlights.

1024
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:14,930
l tell ya, if this thing came out on Halloween it'd have a hell of a time.

1025
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:21,170
Oh god.

1026
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:23,239
The floor feels like mud.

1027
01:07:23,272 --> 01:07:25,207
That's because it is mud.

1028
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:26,575
Dirt and water make mud.

1029
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:28,377
You learn something new every day, don't you?

1030
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:32,348
The door doesn't lock from this side.

1031
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:34,183
Well, that makes sense.

1032
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:36,052
Why would somebody want to lock themselves in a basement?

1033
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:37,453
All right, don't start.

1034
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:40,890
All right, get some hammer and nails,

1035
01:07:40,923 --> 01:07:42,358
l gotta lock it from the other side

1036
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:43,426
and come back in through the window.

1037
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:44,760
You're going out there?

1038
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:47,630
No, I'm gonna mentally will everything to happen.

1039
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:49,732
What a stupid question!

1040
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:52,768
You always ask the stupidest questions!

1041
01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:54,270
[door locking]

1047
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,298
ls someone paying you to stand in front

1048
01:08:56,332 --> 01:08:58,267
of an open window or is that your own idea?

1049
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:01,036
Hey, there's some razor blades in the corner you can play with next.

1050
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:02,838
Would you like to do that?

1051
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:06,475
- Look, Mike-- - Let's get this window boarded up first, hmm, please?

1052
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:12,748
- Give me that one. - [Stacy] That one doesn't fit.

1053
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:17,153
That one don't fit either.

1054
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:19,722
- How 'bout this one? - The short one.

1055
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:22,224
Oh, that's nice. Give me a nail.

1056
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:27,363
Ouch, [Censored]! Ow!

1057
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:29,665
Never mind.

1058
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:31,834
- [Stacy] So, uh-- - Give me another one.

1059
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,205
You know what keeps coming to mind?

1060
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:38,841
Invasion of the Body Snatchers.

1061
01:09:38,874 --> 01:09:41,644
- Yeah? - Yeah, well, l mean, mind control,

1063
01:09:44,713 --> 01:09:47,650
So, how did they kill 'em in that one?

1064
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:49,185
- They didn't. - Great.

1065
01:09:49,218 --> 01:09:51,520
[somber music]

1066
01:10:19,415 --> 01:10:21,083
Are we just gonna stay down here all night?

1067
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:24,086
l mean, shouldn't we think of a plan?

1068
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:27,590
A plan, what a wonderful idea. What'd you have in mind?

1069
01:10:27,623 --> 01:10:31,126
l don't know. Look, you're the expert in this field.

1070
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,362
Well, the problem is we don't know too much about this thing.

1071
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:35,531
It doesn't react to water

1072
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:38,200
and shaving cream is on its 10 best dishes list.

1073
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:39,268
Well,

1074
01:10:39,935 --> 01:10:42,171
um, what about fire?

Maybe we could burn t.

1076

Fire would be hard to come by down here.

Tell you the truth, l think that thing's pretty stupid.

1088

that it beats the crap out of itself,

1089
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:17,139
then we can get close enough to it with an ax or something.
