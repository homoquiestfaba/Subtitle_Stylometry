MAN (ON PA): Lockdown

half hour to 9:00
for Cell Block C.

4
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:32,926
C Block innmates

00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:35,663
one half hour earlier at 8:00.

6
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,801
Mr. Jacobs, call
Central, please.

7
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,171
Officer Jacobs, call Central.

8
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:44,638
The lockdown tonight
will be delayed.

9
00:01:49,177 --> 00:01:50,444
Three years in this dump.

10
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:57,785
I can hardly remember the
last time I played the sax.

[sax music playing]

12
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,584
Ah!

13
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:37,458
Thank you.

14
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:38,426
That's all for tonight, folks.

15
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:39,460
Hope you had a good time.

16
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,194
Drive safe.

17
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:41,362
Good night.

18
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:04,452
Richardson.

[beeping]

20
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:15,896
Mr. McElroy, I
do hope you're not

21
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:17,731
going to give me any bad news.

22
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,634
You know how much it
upsets Mr. Fisher.

23
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:21,569
Don't worry.

24
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:22,770
Tell Fisher I have
the merchandise.

25
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,804
Good.

26
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:26,106
And the other business, the gal?

27
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,375
Yeah, well, our
friend in Oakland

28
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:28,776
couldn't take care
of the leading lady.

29
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,978
This is very
disheartening, Mr. McElroy,

30
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,746
but we'll deal with that later.

31
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:35,283
Right now, we're waiting
for you and the merchandise.

32
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:37,217
You have 30 minutes.

33
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:38,319
There's one small problem.

34
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,087
I'll have to call you back.

35
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:41,221
Oh, he's hung up.

36
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,595
What do you think?

37
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:48,662
Oh, God.

38
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,130
It was beautiful.
- I'm glad you liked it.

39
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,265
I wouldn't want you
to endorse something

40
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:53,934
you didn't believe in.

41
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,937
"Endorse?"

42
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,940
It's called "Lisa's Dreams."

43
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,108
Oh, baby!

44
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,042
Mwah!

45
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:03,811

[inaudible]

47
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:05,579
I'll be back in a minute.

48
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,114
I just gotta change.
Bye.

49
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:08,148
OK.

50
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,418
So when do I get one of those?

51
00:04:10,518 --> 00:04:12,653
Honey, they don't make
'em like that anymore.

52
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:13,654
Great, thanks.

53
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,259
Sax-man.

54
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,961
Mackie, I don't believe it.

55
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:23,964
I remember when that
thing was bigger than you.

56
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,533
Upon a time, it was.

57
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:26,667
Hey!

58
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:27,968
It's been a long time.
How the hell are you?

59
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:29,537
I'm good.

60
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:30,371
You're looking at one of the
busiest real estate brokers

61
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:32,272
in the Bay Area.

62
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:34,442
If you're so busy,
what are you doing in LA?

63
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:36,176
Hey, I came to catch your act.

64
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,311
Shit Bullshit.

65
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:38,812
You haven't seen
me play for years.

66
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:39,913
Yeah, right.

67
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,850
Mike, I got about 30
minutes to make a very

68
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,051
important business meeting.

69
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,953
This guy's a real
stickler for time.

70
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:49,323
Anyway, it turns out I meet
this girl on the way down here.

71
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:50,858
This chick is a real lush.

72
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,394
We must have hit every
bar on the coast.

73
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:55,963
Right now, she's in the back
of my car, totally crocked.

74
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:58,999
I can't pitch up at the
meeting with this chick.

75
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,968
Can you give me a ride?

76
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:02,470
Sure, but what about the girl?

77
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,838
Hey, she's outlived
her usefulness to me.

78
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:08,442
Now I remember what it
was about you I didn't like.

79
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:11,078
OK, you ready to go?

80
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,180
Yeah, just let me get a
ride home for my girlfriend.

81
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,081
MACKIE: Your girlfriend?

82
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:16,717
Anyone I know?

83
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,019
No, thank God.

84
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:20,921
Well, you know what they say.

85
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:25,158
Once they've had Mack,
they never can go back.

86
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,694
I gotta make a call.

87
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:37,337
Sweetheart, an old
buddy stopped by tonight.

88
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:39,907
I gotta give him
a ride somewhere.

89
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:40,874
Now?

90
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:43,176
I couldn't get out of it.

91
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,244
OK.

92
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,714
Could you give
her a ride home?

93
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:50,283
I would hurry up if
I were you, Mackie.

94
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:52,686
Let's not upset Mr. Fisher.

95
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:55,756
Richardson?

96
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:56,657
Richardson!

97
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,160
Everything OK?

98
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,429
Yeah, fine.

99
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:02,630
Who's Richardson?

100
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,765
Oh, he's a pain in the ass.

101
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:05,699
Let's go.

102
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:12,005
Sir?

103
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,541
So I'm sick of his fuckups.

104
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,447
It's about time we got--

105
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:21,482
it's about time we got
rid of Mr. McElroy.

106
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:28,856
I just gotta get some
stuff out of my car.

107
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:50,444
Looks like the car.

108
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:51,745
Fuck, man.

109
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,380
Mackie, you're not gonna
leave her like that.

110
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:54,582
Come on, man.

111
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:55,683
As soon as I take
care of business,

112
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,017
I'll come back for her, OK?

113
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:25,779
So where are we headed?

114
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,714
Down Malibu.

115
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,219
God, this is so beautiful.

116
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,788
I remember I did some of my best
fucking in these hills here.

117
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:37,525
Yeah, I got a good chance
at a record contract.

118
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:38,659
If it comes through,
Lisa and I are

119
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,062

00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,283
I think we got a homicide.

123
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:04,317
You secure the crime scene.

124
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,218
I'm going after the car.

Mike, I gotta take a leak.

132
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:24,271
Pull over.

134
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:42,055

Come on!

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,530
Mackie, what are you doing?

143
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:25,132
Come on, move it!

144
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,533
This is crazy.

145
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:28,501
Shut the fuck up,
Michael, and just drive.

146
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:29,536
What the hell's going on?

147
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:30,437
Come on!

148
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:32,005
Fucking drive, man!

Come on!

Who's in command
at the road block?

151
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,522
CONTROL: Detective Marsh.

152
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:50,457
I'm patching you through to him.

153
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:51,424
Stand by.

154
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,126
- Roger.
- Marsh here.

155
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:54,061
Go ahead.

156
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:55,195
Over.

157
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:56,429
OFFICER (ON RADIO): Are
you ready to intercept?

158
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,399
Yeah, ready and waiting.

159
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:00,834
What the fuck was that?

160
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:04,872
I knew it, man.

161
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:06,539
I'd lay it 8-1
it's that asshole.

162
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,941
Richardson.

163
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,142
Well, I think we should
get the fuck out of here.

164
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:10,243
Start the bloody car.
Come on, move!

165
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:16,383
Let's go, man, faster!

Control, be advised.

167
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:18,986
We're almost at the road block.

168

Come on, put the
gun down, Mackie!

169
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:24,624
Shut the fuck up Michael.

170
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:26,226
- ETA is 20 seconds.
- Come on, Mackie.

171
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:27,227
This is nuts!
Come on!

172
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:28,495
Shut the fuck up!

173
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:31,098
Michael, I'll blow
your fucking head off.

174
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:32,499

175
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:33,433
Move it!

He's no stopping!

177
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,305

JUDGE: In consideration
of your clean record,

181
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:29,589
I sentence you, Michael Keller,
to five years in state prison

with the possibility of
parole in three years.

183
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:35,128
Take him away.

184
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,769
Looks like you're
history, killer.

185
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:43,003
You're out of here.

186
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:43,937
Let's go.

187
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,466
OK, let's see.

188
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:30,317
Michael Keller, number 3724891.

189
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,218
Manslaughter, huh?

190
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,161
A cop.

191
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,562
Well, well.

192
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,297
Who'd you suck off
to get out early?

193
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,436
Your mother.

194
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:52,205
Hey, just cool it.

195
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:53,773
Let's get him out
of here, all right?

196
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:55,809
You better hope I never
see you on the outside.

197
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:00,047
Hear me, cop killer?

198
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:02,009
You know, this
is really funny.

199
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:04,677
I-- I thought I had so much
that I wanted to say to you,

200
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:08,048
but I can't seem to
think of anything.

201
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,420
You don't know
how hard it's been

202
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,557
for me, not being able to
see you the past few years.

203
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:20,093
I mean, not that I didn't
understand your reasons

204
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,729
for making me stay away.

205
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:23,863
Because I did.

206
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,200
It was just hard, you know?

207
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:32,639
Michael.

208
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:35,875
Michael, please talk to me.

209
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:37,577
- What do you want me to say?
- I don't know.

210
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:38,645
Say anything.

211
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:39,712
Say whatever you want.

212
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,081
Just talk to me!

213
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:42,449
You want me tell
you how wonderful

214
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,017
it was living in Disneyland?

215
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:46,653
Shall I tell you about that?

216
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:47,988
Sorry.

217
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:52,492
I didn't mean to press you.

218
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:54,027
But I understand.

219
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:55,795
You can't understand.

220
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,763
You're wrong, Michael.

221
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:58,198
I do understand!

222
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,533
I understand your pain
completely, because I've had

223
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,503
to live with that same pain.

224
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:06,339
It's like every day I've
been in prison just like you.

225
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:11,979
Now we're free.

226
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,515
We're free to start over.

227
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:17,084
Michael, for both of us.

228
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,958
That is, if you still want me.

229
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:43,943
[badly playing saxophone]

230
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:07,967
[playing saxophone]

231
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:27,054
You know, when I saw
you, all those old feelings

232
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:28,255
started pouring back into me.

233
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:31,824
Guess all this time
I've been setting

234
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,594
myself up to play the victim.

235
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:36,663
That's why I stopped you
from coming to see me.

236
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:43,236
But when I was walking around,
I realized the only way that's

237
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,339
going to happen is if I let it.

238
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:50,110
I have a choice to be
whatever I allow myself to be.

239
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,778
And I choose to be happy.

240
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:57,717
And the only way I'm happy
is when I'm with you.

241
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:24,644
That's very good.

242
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:35,455
Police, open up.

243
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:39,159
Everybody stay where you are.

244
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:42,829
Get dressed.

245
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,031
I got some people downtown
who wanna see the show too.

246
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:46,333
Read 'em their rights.

247
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:47,800
Why don't you pigs
mind your own business?

248
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:57,344
We're only giving the
people what they want!

249
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,083
Tyrone, Tyrone.

250
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:08,221
I've been wanting your
ass for a long time.

251
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:10,390
He's going to love this.

252
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,291
I hope so.

253
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,260
Now, look, guys.

254
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,929
If you could play that
way tonight, [laughter]

255
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,264
I'd be a happy man.

256
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:52,532
That sounds real good.

257
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,036
Hey.

258
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,338
I don't believe my eyes!

259
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,740
If it ain't the real
sax-man in the flesh.

260
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,008
Wow.

261
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:03,009
How you doing, Mike?

262
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:03,976
Fine.

263
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:05,144
How are you doing, Frank?

264
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:09,316
[inaudible] Hey, guys.

265
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,818
I want you to meet one of
the hottest sax players

266
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:15,522
in this town, Mike Keller.

267
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:16,223
Hi, Mike.

268
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:17,890
How are you, guys?

269
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,426
Hey, Mike.

270
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:22,462
I heard about your misfortune.

271
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:24,731
Must've been a real drag, eh?

272
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,599
Yeah, it was a bad deal.

273
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:31,604
Listen, Frank, I need a gig.

274
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:32,605
Could you use me?

275
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:33,573
Absolutely, man.

276
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:34,407
Wow.

277
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,108
And how's the chops holding up?

278
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:37,210
Better than ever.

279
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,511
You want me to prove it to you?

280
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,980
Hey, you don't have
to audition for me, man.

281
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,749
I know your word.

282
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,084
God knows we've played
enough gigs together.

283
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,052
Yeah.

284
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:48,020
I'll tell you what to do.

285
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,157
Be here tonight about 10:00.

286
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:52,692
Then we'll give it a go.

287
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:57,697
Everything goes well, I'll
speak money with management, OK?

288
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:58,631
I appreciate it.

289
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,385
A friend of ours has been
waiting a long time for you

290
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:19,952
to hit the streets again, pal.

291
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,021
He wants you to know he
just hasn't forgotten how

292
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,856
bad you and Mackie fucked up.

293
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:28,060
He wants his money back.

294
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,696
What the fuck are
you talking about?

295
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:31,531
I don't know anything
about any money!

296
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:33,266
I told you he was
gonna need some coaxing.

297
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:34,901
Let me have him for two minutes.

298
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:35,935
I'll help his memory.

299
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:38,237
No, that won't be necessary.

300
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:39,306
You better watch
my partner, pal.

301
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:40,973
He's fucking crazy.

302
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,209
Right!

303
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,811
So do yourself a favor, huh?

304
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,413
No more games.

305
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:48,881
Otherwise, next time, I might
not be able to hold him back.

306
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:56,823
Look, our friend,
he's a businessman.

307
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,826
When he lays out half a
million for something,

308
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,461
he expects delivery.

309
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:03,796
When he don't get
what he expects,

310
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:07,567
it's only natural he
should want his money back.

311
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:10,637
But to show you he's not
completely unreasonable,

312
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:13,205
you have 48 hours to
come up with the bread.

313
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:15,375
OK?
We'll be in touch real soon.

314
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:21,981
Give him the tape.

315
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:24,183
For your viewing pleasure.

316
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,719
Goes great with popcorn.

317
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:27,620
Enjoy the show.

318
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,733
MAN (ON TAPE): By now, I'm sure
you've got a good understanding

319
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:41,901
of the situation.

320
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:43,302
Oh my God.

321
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:45,905
MAN (ON TAPE): So I see
no need to go on about it.

322
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:47,507
It's simple.

323
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:52,044
You give us the money, and we'll
give you your girlfriend, Lisa.

324
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,212
What money?

325
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,414
MAN (ON TAPE): So be smart.

326
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:56,549
Don't fuck with me.

327
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,686
Because if you do,
you're gonna force

328
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:04,023
me to make your girlfriend
into a moving picture star.

329
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:04,957
Shit!

330
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:16,536
MACKIE: I just gotta get
some stuff out of my car.

331
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:19,939
MIKE: What the hell
was in the briefcase?

332
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:20,873
Money?

333
00:22:23,443 --> 00:22:26,078
No, he was carrying
porno flicks.

334
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,716
[gunfire]

335
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:32,184
Where the hell could a
half million dollars go?

336
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:36,423
REPORTER: Early today, Detective
Marsh led officers of the LAPD

337
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:38,425
in the apprehension
of long suspected

338
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:41,961
pornographers operating
from this 29th Street motel.

339
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:45,297
Detective Marsh, was the raid
the success you had hoped?

340
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:47,199
Yes, we've made some
important arrests,

341
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:50,302
and we're hoping they'll lead
to further information and more

342
00:22:50,403 --> 00:22:51,571
arrests.

343
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:52,905
REPORTER: Does that
mean the ringleaders

344
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:55,007
were not among those who
were apprehended today?

345
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:57,710
Well, we have Tyrone
Richardson in custody,

346
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,447
but we're considering the
possibility that Richardson

347
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,949
may be part of a bigger outfit.

348
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:05,485
REPORTER: In the meantime,
Tyrone Richardson and company

349
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:06,986
are in custody.

350
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:09,689
And channel 3 News will be
watching that story closely.

351
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:14,994
From South Central Los
Angeles, I'm Sheila Hall.

352
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:15,962
MACKIE: Richardson!

353
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,296
Everything OK?

354
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,431
Yeah, fine.

355
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:20,399
Who's Richardson?

356
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,569
Oh, he's a pain in the ass.

357
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:33,913
SONG: I was trying to
live my life alone,

358
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:39,886
refusing to believe that
love could make me whole.

359
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:49,095
Still, it seems no matter how
I hide, something in my heart

360
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:51,864
won't be denied.

361
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:58,471
It's the lonely love that
turns the world this way,

362
00:23:58,571 --> 00:24:03,843
changing night to day
when I lose my way.

363
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:10,049
It's the lonely love
takes away the pain

364
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:14,453
and brings me home again.

365
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:16,055
It's the only love.

366
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,761
Mike, I gotta take a leak.

367
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:22,729
Pull over.

368
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:06,272
OFFICER: Guess who
made bail this morning.

369
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:08,374
Richardson.
Already, huh?

370
00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:10,042
Yeah, he's being
processed right now.

371
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:13,245
Any instructions?

372
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,715
I think his boss
got the message.

373
00:25:15,815 --> 00:25:18,484
Next time I speak,
maybe he'll listen.

374
00:25:18,585 --> 00:25:19,686
Put Stoke and
Haber on the watch.

375
00:25:19,786 --> 00:25:21,187
They know the routine.

376
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:22,088
Got it.

377
00:27:36,856 --> 00:27:38,958
Does that feel
familiar, you rat's ass?

378
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,895
You tell your boss
I got his money,

379
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:45,597
but he's gonna have to
play the game my way.

380
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:47,533
What's his name?

381
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:48,835
Fuck off.

382
00:27:48,935 --> 00:27:51,237
I said, what's his name?

383
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:54,841
Fisher, Jack Fisher!

384
00:27:54,941 --> 00:27:58,277
You give this to Jack, and
you tell him what I said.

385
00:27:58,377 --> 00:28:00,212
You got it?

386
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:01,147
I got it.

387
00:28:24,804 --> 00:28:26,238
So where is he?

388
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:28,808
Hey, this is where the note
says to meet him, all right?

389
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:34,781
Sir!

390
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,551
Thank you very much.

391
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:40,719
That's for you.

392
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:49,896
I see your boyfriend
has a sense of humor.

393
00:28:49,996 --> 00:28:53,499
It seems like you and I will
be taking a little ride.

394
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:55,067
You two stay behind.

395
00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:04,130
Richardson?

396
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,898
Well, surprise, surprise.

397
00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:07,399
I knew your boss
wouldn't have the balls

398
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:09,468
to come see me himself.

399
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,870
Well, he's a very busy man.

400
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:13,472
Get moving there.

401
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:14,473
I assume you have the money?

402
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:20,146
Well, then, there's no problem.

403
00:31:20,246 --> 00:31:21,080
No!

404
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,886
No!

405
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:30,489
No, stop it!

406
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:33,092
[screaming]

407
00:31:56,983 --> 00:31:58,884
[knocking on door]

408
00:31:58,985 --> 00:32:01,420
Sergeant Philip Keller, US MC.

409
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:19,738
I'm Michael,

410
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:22,708
Phil's baby brother.

411
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:23,609
Sure you are.

412
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:29,448
What the fuck happened to you?

413
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:31,117
I need some help.

414
00:32:31,217 --> 00:32:34,920
Well, get your
ass in here, boy.

415
00:32:35,021 --> 00:32:36,088
On the double!

416
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:57,409
So is it OK if Jennifer
comes over tonight?

417
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:58,710
No.

418
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,414
No, it is not OK.

419
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:05,151
I am sick of that bitch
hanging around here.

420
00:33:05,251 --> 00:33:06,785
The answer is no.

421
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:07,786
Why?

422
00:33:07,886 --> 00:33:08,920
What's she ever done to you?

423
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:10,189
Because I said no!

424
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:12,124
Marissa, you are
beginning to piss me off.

425
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:13,725
Why don't you go shopping?

426
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:17,096
But I just got
back from shopping!

427
00:33:17,196 --> 00:33:19,098
Then just go, will you?

428
00:33:19,198 --> 00:33:20,366
I need a break.

429
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:21,700
Will you just go?
Do you understand that?

430
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,270
Go.
- All right.

431
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,838
But we're going to
Maxwell's tonight, right?

432
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:29,141
I can't tonight.

433
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:30,076
Something just came up.

434
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:31,943
I need to work.

435
00:33:32,044 --> 00:33:34,413
Aw, Jack, you promised
you'd take me out.

436
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,315
How am I ever gonna show off
all those beautiful clothes

437
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:39,118
you 'buy me if you
never take me anywhere?

438
00:33:39,218 --> 00:33:41,720
What, are you
deaf or something?

439
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,788
Look, take Jennifer, will you?

440
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:44,723
Just-- will you just--

441
00:33:44,823 --> 00:33:45,757
I don't give a fuck.

442
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:46,658
Just go.

443
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:52,298
Jackie.

444
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,436
You're so Jackie Jackie, Jackie.

445
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,143
Yeah.

446
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:06,745
Well, you take this.

447
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:08,147
And you just go.

448
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,651
You're so good to me.

449
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:15,521
I'll never ever leave you.
- You're welcome.

450
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,427
You what?

451
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:23,162
No.

452
00:34:23,262 --> 00:34:24,730
Nobody ever leaves
Jack Fisher, baby.

453
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:28,267
No.

454
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:35,207
Yes.

455
00:34:46,985 --> 00:34:48,454
[beeping]

456
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:02,768
Do you know what this is?

457
00:35:02,868 --> 00:35:05,704
Do yo?

458
00:35:05,804 --> 00:35:09,040
It's your death warrant.

459
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:12,378
[unzips]

460
00:35:12,478 --> 00:35:23,255
Isn't that [inaudible]
Apparently,

461
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:25,791
your boyfriend didn't give a
shit whether you lived or died.

462
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:32,798
And now he's dead.

463
00:35:32,898 --> 00:35:35,467
I'm stuck with you, aren't I?

464
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:36,368
Agh!

465
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:45,143
Do you like movies?

466
00:35:45,244 --> 00:35:47,546
I hope you do.

467
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:51,016
Because I got a new
one the other day.

468
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:52,884
I would like your opinion on it.

469
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,496
We can watch it together.

470
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:07,266
And then we can get
to know each other.

471
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:17,209
[sobbing]

472
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:23,549
[screaming]

473
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,519
[laughter]

474
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:33,625
Harry, if anything happens to
her, I don't know what I'll do.

475
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:35,761
Well, don't you
worry about that.

476
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:36,662
We'll take care of that.

477
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:42,901
Well, you know, I don't
think there's a day goes by I

478
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:45,203
don't think about your brother.

479
00:36:45,304 --> 00:36:47,606
We were real close, you know?

480
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:52,744
I mean, I can honestly say
I think he's about the only

481
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:55,146
real friend I ever had.

482
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:57,182
You were in every
one of his letters.

483
00:36:57,283 --> 00:36:58,884
Man, he used to
crack me up, you know.

484
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:06,325
We were almost on
that plane home.

485
00:37:06,425 --> 00:37:07,993
Four more miles.

486
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:10,996
Four more stinking miles is
all I had left on this tour.

487
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:18,036
I had this crazy notion that
I wanted to drive, you know?

488
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:22,007
And-- as I--

489
00:37:22,107 --> 00:37:25,777
you know, I really don't
wanna talk about this shit.

490
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:26,712
I really don't.

491
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:41,860
Besides, we got some business
to take care of, anyway.

492
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:38,249
Well, this looks
like a good spot.

493
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,885
For what?

494
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:43,021
For finding out what
these guys are up to.

495
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:43,955
Then I'm going.

496
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,691
No, you're not.

497
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:48,193
If we both get caught,
where does that leave Lisa?

498
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:49,227
What if something happens?

499
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,696
No buts!

500
00:38:50,796 --> 00:38:53,231
If we're gonna do this thing,
we're gonna do it right.

501
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,500
Now, I understand
you're worried,

502
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,502
but you've got to trust me, OK?

503
00:38:56,602 --> 00:38:57,603
I know what I'm doing.

504
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:02,674
OK.

505
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:03,575
All right.

506
00:39:18,824 --> 00:39:24,896
[inaudible] It's a really
great [inaudible] downstairs.

507
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:25,897
Give me a lift.

508
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:31,236
Be careful.

509
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:32,137
Always am.

510
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:37,108
Well, almost always.

511
00:39:46,552 --> 00:39:49,721
What you reading, Einstein?

512
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:52,424
I've told you before,
Willie, not to call me that.

513
00:39:52,524 --> 00:39:54,392
Oh, so sorry!

514
00:39:54,493 --> 00:39:55,961
[chuckling]

515
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:02,734
If your nose wasn't
always stuck in a book,

516
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:05,737
it might have saved
you a night in jail.

517
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:08,039
[chuckling]

518
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:14,245
I think now would be an
appropriate time to warn

519
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:16,347
you of my mood, William.
- Oh, look at me.

520
00:40:16,448 --> 00:40:17,649
I'm shaking.

521
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:20,118
Willie, just cool it.

522
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:21,219
No, I'm getting
tired of taking

523
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:22,454
orders from this Oxford faggot.

524
00:40:22,554 --> 00:40:23,955
All he ever does is fuck up!

525
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:39,337
Hey.

526
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,306
What am I running here?

527
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:44,743
A day nursery, you
fucking idiots, huh?

528
00:40:44,843 --> 00:40:46,311
Huh?

529
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:49,948
Big John, go get the car.

530
00:40:50,048 --> 00:40:53,985
I've got some unfinished
business for him to sign.

531
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:59,390
And you two, you two stay
here and watch the girl.

532
00:40:59,491 --> 00:41:00,592
Don't mess up.

533
00:41:40,766 --> 00:41:42,668
Did you see her?

534
00:41:42,768 --> 00:41:43,669
She's up there, all right.

535
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:45,904
Where are you going?

536
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,238
I'm going to get
her out of here!

537
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,239
No, you're not!

538
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,076
What are you, crazy?

539
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:53,011
You think these guys
are messing around, huh?

540
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:54,012
Do you?

541
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:55,080
You think this is
some kind of game?

542
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:05,156
Gonna be dark soon.

543
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:08,860
So why don't we go back to the
shop and think this thing over?

544
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,461
You're sure you don't
wanna go to the police?

545
00:42:10,562 --> 00:42:13,298
I'm not going to the police!

546
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:14,633
I'm gonna this by myself.

547
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:16,001
OK, Michael.

548
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:16,935
OK.

549
00:42:22,841 --> 00:42:24,109
Hey, Chuck.
Where's my sandwich?

550
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:25,310
I'm starving here?

551
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,277
CHUCK: Relax, Willie.

552
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,213
It's coming.

553
00:42:28,313 --> 00:42:30,181
WILLIAM: Yeah, when, next week?

554
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:31,983
MARSH (ON RADIO): 1 Mary 12.
This is Marsh.

555
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:32,918
Do you read.

556
00:42:33,018 --> 00:42:33,819
Over?

557
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:38,289
Here we go.

558
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,290
You deal with him, Stokey.

559
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,291
He makes me nervous.

560
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,226
Pussy.

561
00:42:43,428 --> 00:42:44,395
Mary 12 here.

562
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:45,697
Over.

563
00:42:45,797 --> 00:42:47,232
MARSH (ON RADIO): How's
it going over there?

564
00:42:47,332 --> 00:42:48,466
Yeah, everything's quiet, sir.

565
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,035
MARSH (ON RADIO):
Well, I hope you

566
00:42:50,135 --> 00:42:52,070
packed a lunch, because you're
gonna be there for a while.

567
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,304
How long is "a while?"

568
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,572
Until I say so.

569
00:42:54,673 --> 00:42:56,141
That's how long!

570
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:58,043
Something's going on over there,
and I wanna know what it is!

571
00:42:58,143 --> 00:42:59,444
I shouldn't have to
remind you of what

572
00:42:59,544 --> 00:43:00,746
the consequences
will be if anything

573
00:43:00,846 --> 00:43:02,447
goes wrong with this project.

574
00:43:02,547 --> 00:43:03,348
One slip-up.

575
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:04,683
and we all go down.

576
00:43:04,783 --> 00:43:07,318
And if that happens, I
will rip your heart out.

577
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,654
That goes for your partner too.

578
00:43:08,754 --> 00:43:12,257
Do you read me, Detective Stoke?

579
00:43:12,357 --> 00:43:15,827
Yeah, I read you.

580
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:18,063
It's starting to get a little
out of hand, wouldn't you say?

581
00:43:30,842 --> 00:43:33,344
[knocking on door]

582
00:43:41,987 --> 00:43:44,189
[groaning]

583
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:46,658
Help me, help me, help me!

584
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:48,193
What the hell happened?

585
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:49,094
Help!

586
00:44:18,623 --> 00:44:21,760
Don't even think about it.

587
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,061
Should have worn
your bib, Clyde.

588
00:44:26,297 --> 00:44:27,165
Turn around.

589
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,275
What the fuck is this?

590
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:38,744
Where is she?

591
00:44:38,844 --> 00:44:39,878
Where's who?

592
00:44:42,247 --> 00:44:44,315
You've got five seconds
to tell me where she's at.

593
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,120
It's behind those mirrors.

594
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,055
How do I get in?

595
00:44:50,155 --> 00:44:52,657
Getting

596
00:44:52,758 --> 00:44:54,592
There's a code number
he punches into the phone,

597
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,062
but I don't know what it is!

598
00:44:57,162 --> 00:44:59,030
I swear to God, I
don't know what it is!

599
00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:12,744
You girls having fun?

600
00:45:12,844 --> 00:45:13,879
Fuck you!

601
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:40,205
You two all right in there?

602
00:45:40,305 --> 00:45:42,573
Yeah.

603
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:44,175
Watch out, Harry!

604
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:05,663
Harry.

605
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:06,798
Get out of here.

606
00:46:10,668 --> 00:46:12,270
Get the hell out of here!

607
00:46:23,815 --> 00:46:24,615
I don't like this.

608
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:25,951
Something's wrong.

609
00:46:26,051 --> 00:46:28,186
Yeah, who the
hell are those guys?

610
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:29,087
I don't know.

611
00:46:33,925 --> 00:46:34,926
Better check this out.

612
00:47:09,294 --> 00:47:11,162
This is the key to
the house out back.

613
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:35,520
OK, now what?

614
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:39,824
You wait here.

615
00:47:39,925 --> 00:47:40,959
I'm gonna make a phone call.

616
00:47:50,468 --> 00:47:53,104
This whole scene is
starting to get fucked up.

617
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:06,151
Yes?

618
00:48:06,251 --> 00:48:07,185
It's me.

619
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:09,454
I have to speak to
Fisher right now.

620
00:48:14,092 --> 00:48:15,026
Fisher, the girl escaped.

621
00:48:15,126 --> 00:48:16,194
She's with her boyfriend.

622
00:48:16,294 --> 00:48:17,662
Marsh doesn't know anything yet.

623
00:48:17,762 --> 00:48:20,331
Forget about your boss.

624
00:48:20,431 --> 00:48:22,533
You get those two back
for me, and I'll make

625
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:25,203
it more than worth your while.

626
00:48:25,303 --> 00:48:28,873
Do you understand what
I'm trying to say?

627
00:48:28,974 --> 00:48:30,041
Yes.

628
00:48:30,141 --> 00:48:30,976
FISHER (ON PHONE): Good.

629
00:48:31,076 --> 00:48:32,210
That's very good.

630
00:48:37,715 --> 00:48:39,617
Will you make me a line?

631
00:50:21,986 --> 00:50:24,489
[sobbing]

632
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:32,863
Must be one of Fisher's men.

633
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:34,599
God!

634
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:36,000
Listen to me.

635
00:50:36,101 --> 00:50:40,738
Honey, you've got to
get a hold of yourself.

636
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:42,273
I'll call Harry.

637
00:50:52,117 --> 00:50:54,018
[phone ringing]

638
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:57,021
Yeah.

639
00:50:57,122 --> 00:50:59,824
Now, listen, just calm down.

640
00:50:59,924 --> 00:51:03,060
Are you two all right?

641
00:51:03,161 --> 00:51:05,630
All right, now listen to me.

642
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,599
I got a small cabin
up at Turtle Creek.

643
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:10,435
It's about four hours
north of the city.

644
00:51:12,737 --> 00:51:15,773
I'll meet you out back.
And just be careful.

645
00:52:14,232 --> 00:52:15,433
1 Mary 12, this is Marsh.

646
00:52:15,533 --> 00:52:17,802
Over.

647
00:52:17,902 --> 00:52:19,003
1 Mary 12, this is Marsh.

648
00:52:19,103 --> 00:52:19,937
Come in.

649
00:52:20,037 --> 00:52:21,772
Over.

650
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:22,740
1 Mary 12, come in.

651
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,641
Over.

652
00:52:26,777 --> 00:52:27,712
Where are those clowns?

653
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:35,286
Fisher, it happened so fast!

654
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,661
[moaning]

655
00:53:19,163 --> 00:53:21,632
[sobbing]

656
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:29,607
Oh, oh.

657
00:53:33,511 --> 00:53:34,312
Marissa.

658
00:53:39,016 --> 00:53:48,626
I swear I shall go shopping
for those bastards for you.

659
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:53,964
Oh, fuck.

660
00:54:07,678 --> 00:54:09,213
If they had any hopes
of calling the police,

661
00:54:09,314 --> 00:54:10,481
they can't now.

662
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:12,917
Not with a dead
policeman on their hands.

663
00:54:13,017 --> 00:54:14,485
The logical assumption
would be that they're

664
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:16,987
seeking a place to hide.

665
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:17,922
The question is, where?

666
00:54:20,725 --> 00:54:23,761
The answer to that question
is sitting over there.

667
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:30,067
When he tells me
what I want to know,

668
00:54:30,167 --> 00:54:33,304
I'm gonna cut his balls off.

669
00:54:33,404 --> 00:54:35,906
I think that would be
unwise at this time, Jack.

670
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:37,875
Not only could he be useful in
helping us locate Mr. Keller

671
00:54:37,975 --> 00:54:41,479
and his friends, but he
might make an excellent decoy

672
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:43,047
when comes the time
for us to learn

673
00:54:43,147 --> 00:54:45,516
the nature of their defenses.

674
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:47,718
Mr. Keller has proven
himself quite resourceful.

675
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:49,086
And I'd hate to see
any of your men,

676
00:54:49,186 --> 00:54:53,891
myself included,
get hurt needlessly.

677
00:54:53,991 --> 00:54:54,825
Yeah.

678
00:54:57,495 --> 00:54:58,529
Yeah, you could be right.

679
00:55:05,936 --> 00:55:07,738
You call Lou.

680
00:55:07,838 --> 00:55:11,642
And you tell Lou that
he owes me a favor.

681
00:55:11,742 --> 00:55:20,351
And you tell him that I want
four of his best men, now.

682
00:55:20,451 --> 00:55:23,488
It's time that our
Detective Haber

683
00:55:23,588 --> 00:55:24,722
showed us want we want to know.

684
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:29,694
Isn't it, soldier?

685
00:55:29,794 --> 00:55:32,630
Yeah, right.

686
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:34,198
There was something
you wanted to tell me?

687
00:55:34,298 --> 00:55:35,700
Oh, yeah.

688
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,001
We still haven't been able
to contact Stoke and Haber.

689
00:55:37,101 --> 00:55:38,669
Any suggestions?

690
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:40,905
Well, let's aggravate Fisher,
and see if he can help us out.

691
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:05,396
Look, you tear
this place apart.

692
00:56:05,496 --> 00:56:06,597
I want some answers.

693
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,394
How you doing, Sammy?

694
00:56:37,495 --> 00:56:38,963
Fill it up, would you?

695
00:56:43,434 --> 00:56:45,936
[music playing]

696
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:48,172
Harry.

697
00:56:48,272 --> 00:56:49,874
How you doing, Mel?

698
00:56:49,974 --> 00:56:53,678
What the hell are you
doing here this time of year?

699
00:56:53,778 --> 00:56:55,112
Bass don't run for
another two months.

700
00:56:55,212 --> 00:56:56,213
You know that.

701
00:56:56,313 --> 00:56:57,548
I know.

702
00:56:57,648 --> 00:56:59,383
I just had to get out
of the city for a while.

703
00:56:59,484 --> 00:57:01,251
Yeah.

704
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:04,722
Mind ringing this up for me?

705
00:57:04,822 --> 00:57:05,623
Sure.

706
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:10,961
Let's see.

707
00:57:21,305 --> 00:57:22,139
Well, fill 'em up.

708
00:57:30,147 --> 00:57:31,015
Oh, God.

709
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:33,350
Sick son of a bitch!

710
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,986
Put out an APB now.

711
00:57:36,086 --> 00:57:37,387
I want this animal.

712
00:57:37,488 --> 00:57:38,756
Yes, sir.

713
00:57:38,856 --> 00:57:41,325
Tom, there's something wrong.

714
00:57:41,425 --> 00:57:42,893
How do you mean?

715
00:57:42,993 --> 00:57:43,694
I don't know.

716
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:44,895
You just seemed preoccupied.

717
00:57:44,995 --> 00:57:45,963
That's all.

718
00:57:46,063 --> 00:57:47,297
What's bugging you?
- Oh, I don't know.

719
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:48,232
I don't know.

720
00:57:52,837 --> 00:57:57,608
I guess it's just tougher to
deal with scenes like this.

721
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:00,945
Come on.

722
00:58:01,045 --> 00:58:01,879
We got work to do.

723
00:58:28,706 --> 00:58:30,174
Thanks, Harry.

724
00:58:30,274 --> 00:58:34,144
Man, this place is great.

725
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:35,813
Just the bare essentials.

726
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,718
Hey, Harry.
- Yeah, Mike.

727
00:58:40,818 --> 00:58:42,152
You think he's coming here?

728
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:43,721
Let me tell you something.

729
00:58:43,821 --> 00:58:45,723
If that guy was a rat,
he'd find food at a Weight

730
00:58:45,823 --> 00:58:48,058
Watchers convention.

731
00:58:48,158 --> 00:58:51,095
Now, let's get cracking!

732
00:58:51,195 --> 00:58:52,029
Come on!

733
00:58:56,634 --> 00:58:57,802
What is he up to?

734
00:58:57,902 --> 00:58:59,604
I have no idea,
but I trust him.

735
00:59:26,964 --> 00:59:30,635
Hey, Harry, what's that for?

736
00:59:30,735 --> 00:59:31,936
It's kind of oatmeal.

737
00:59:32,036 --> 00:59:33,971
It helps the gasoline
stick to your ribs.

738
01:00:00,064 --> 01:00:01,431
I could really
get used to this.

739
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:02,633
I always had
something a little bit

740
01:00:02,733 --> 01:00:04,334
more tropical in mind.

741
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,103
Sounds good.

742
01:00:06,203 --> 01:00:08,939
I always kind of fantasized
I'd have my own nightclub.

743
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:09,640
Mhm.

744
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:10,875
Nothing too fancy.

745
01:00:10,975 --> 01:00:12,810
Just a place where
I could play my sax.

746
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:16,513
Maybe a little recording
studio next door.

747
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:17,882
Now, wait a minute.

748
01:00:17,982 --> 01:00:20,617
Your fantasy's getting
awfully expensive now.

749
01:00:20,718 --> 01:00:21,852
And then if we had the money--

750
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:23,888
I mean, if you're
gonna dream, dream big.

751
01:00:23,988 --> 01:00:24,822
Yeah.

752
01:00:41,906 --> 01:00:45,776
Jack, what makes you so
sure they went this way?

753
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:47,344
Hurry up with
that line, will you?

754
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:58,923
Big John, pull over.

755
01:01:49,673 --> 01:01:51,641
Get Lou's men to get
rid of the bodies.

756
01:01:51,742 --> 01:01:52,777
Tell 'em to tidy up.

757
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:29,814
Jesus, Harry.

758
01:02:29,914 --> 01:02:31,448
This place is starting
to look like Fort Knox.

759
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:38,488
What are the lights for?

760
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:39,389
The garden party.

761
01:02:58,642 --> 01:03:00,044
Yo, hey, hey!

762
01:03:00,144 --> 01:03:01,879
Where do you think you're going?

763
01:03:01,979 --> 01:03:03,113
First, I'm gonna
go to the head.

764
01:03:03,213 --> 01:03:04,514
Then I'm gonna get
me something to eat.

765
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:06,216
OK?
Is that OK with you?

766
01:03:06,316 --> 01:03:09,854
Well, you won't mind if
I tag along, then, right?

767
01:03:09,954 --> 01:03:11,055
Fucking asshole.

768
01:03:11,155 --> 01:03:12,456
[giggling]

769
01:03:22,699 --> 01:03:26,003
It's pretty wild, what Fisher
did to Freddie and Chuck, huh?

770
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:32,042
Guess this city's out
one car, huh, Haber?

771
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:35,212
Hope they don't raise my taxes.

772
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:36,146
Yeah.

773
01:03:36,246 --> 01:03:37,181
[giggling]

774
01:03:38,248 --> 01:03:39,483
That's why I
hang with Big John.

775
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:40,817
The man is my idol.

776
01:03:40,918 --> 01:03:45,522
He's too smart to get
in a position like that.

777
01:03:45,622 --> 01:03:48,058
He made me smart too!

778
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:53,697
Now we're just like Kareem
Abdul Jabbar and Magic Johnson.

779
01:03:53,797 --> 01:03:55,099
[snaps fingers]

780
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:56,867
Hey, let a guy
shit in peace, man.

781
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:02,272
We're unstoppable, man!

782
01:04:02,372 --> 01:04:03,273
[flushing]

783
01:04:03,373 --> 01:04:06,243
Shit.

784
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:07,211
Yeah.

785
01:04:07,311 --> 01:04:10,047
Bet that's a
load off your mind.

786
01:04:10,147 --> 01:04:12,649
You're fucking right, it is.

787
01:04:12,749 --> 01:04:14,218
[giggling]

788
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:19,423
[sniffing]

789
01:04:19,523 --> 01:04:23,293
Jack, don't you ever
get enough of that stuff?

790
01:04:23,393 --> 01:04:26,863
Richardson, you're
beginning to piss me off.

791
01:04:26,964 --> 01:04:28,165
What'll it be, sir?

792
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:44,881
I-- I'm sorry, sir.

793
01:04:44,982 --> 01:04:46,050
$5 for you.

794
01:04:49,419 --> 01:04:50,687
Your change, sir.

795
01:04:50,787 --> 01:04:52,722
Thank you.

796
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:54,191
And what'll it be for you, sir?

797
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:55,092
Hurry up!

798
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:17,014
Yeah, it's good news.

799
01:05:17,114 --> 01:05:19,416
We just got a call from
a Mel's Trading Post

800
01:05:19,516 --> 01:05:21,118
on highway 40 in Morgan.

801
01:05:21,218 --> 01:05:23,287
Seems like a guy came into
his store 10 minutes ago

802
01:05:23,387 --> 01:05:26,123
and hands him a note stating
that he is Officer Haber.

803
01:05:26,223 --> 01:05:27,257
The note goes on
to say that he's

804
01:05:27,357 --> 01:05:29,359
being held against his will.

805
01:05:29,459 --> 01:05:31,828
From the description of the
cars they were driving in,

806
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:34,898
it sounds like it
could be Fisher.

807
01:05:34,999 --> 01:05:36,400
We're running a plate
check right now.

808
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,701
Did he say where
they're headed?

809
01:05:37,801 --> 01:05:39,769
North on 40.

810
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:41,305
Get me a helicopter
and some men.

811
01:05:41,405 --> 01:05:42,372
We're going up.

812
01:05:42,472 --> 01:05:44,008
And get me a fix on
the exact location.

813
01:05:55,319 --> 01:05:56,987
I'm not gonna stay in there.

814
01:05:57,087 --> 01:05:58,722
It's gonna be the safest
place in these woods

815
01:05:58,822 --> 01:05:59,990
in a short while.

816
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:01,191
Listen, Harry.

817
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:02,692
I appreciate the
thought and everything.

818
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,928
He's right.

819
01:06:05,029 --> 01:06:06,430
Look, I'm not
gonna stay in there.

820
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:07,697
I wanna be with you.

821
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:09,066
I wanna help you.

822
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:11,168
You know, it's up
to you, of course.

823
01:06:11,268 --> 01:06:13,037
But I already got one
woman's death on my hands.

824
01:06:13,137 --> 01:06:14,371
I really don't want hers too.

825
01:06:41,198 --> 01:06:46,336
I promise you,
I'm coming back.

826
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,427
What are those?

827
01:07:43,527 --> 01:07:48,031
These are very
special shells, Michael.

828
01:07:48,132 --> 01:07:49,333
What are they for?

829
01:07:49,433 --> 01:07:50,634
They're gonna help
us harvest our garden.

830
01:07:54,804 --> 01:08:00,844
Well, now we get to test
your theory, Mr. Richardson.

831
01:08:00,944 --> 01:08:01,778
Where's Haber?

832
01:08:01,878 --> 01:08:02,946
Get me Haber.

833
01:08:03,046 --> 01:08:04,581
Haber.

834
01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:08,518
Well, my friend,
now you prove to me

835
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:11,555
that I didn't make a
mistake when I put you

836
01:08:11,655 --> 01:08:15,659
and that lame partner
of yours on the payroll.

837
01:08:15,759 --> 01:08:17,894
Why me?

838
01:08:17,994 --> 01:08:19,963
I was just following orders.

839
01:08:20,063 --> 01:08:21,097
Yes, don't you
think I know that?

840
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:23,099
I know that.

841
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:29,406
It's just, Haber, that
there comes are time when,

842
01:08:29,506 --> 01:08:34,511
in every man's
life, when he's got

843
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:37,214
to start earning
the fucking money

844
01:08:37,314 --> 01:08:40,317
that I believe that
I'm beginning to waste.

845
01:08:40,417 --> 01:08:47,391
But I'm just asking you
to go up to that house,

846
01:08:47,491 --> 01:08:53,597
knock on the door, and
you see if anybody's in.

847
01:08:53,697 --> 01:08:57,701
And how the fuck am I
supposed to do that, Jack?

848
01:08:57,801 --> 01:08:59,336
[chuckling]

849
01:08:59,436 --> 01:09:01,238
You're a policeman,
aren't you?

850
01:09:01,338 --> 01:09:03,307
Do what a fucking
policeman does!

851
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,577
Oh, don't worry.

852
01:09:07,677 --> 01:09:10,414
Like a policeman, I'm not
gonna ask you to do it alone.

853
01:09:10,514 --> 01:09:11,215
Oh no.

854
01:09:11,315 --> 01:09:12,716
I'll send somebody with you.

855
01:09:12,816 --> 01:09:16,686
They can-- they can hold
your little pink hand.

856
01:09:16,786 --> 01:09:18,255
Isn't there a better
way to do this, Jack?

857
01:09:18,355 --> 01:09:20,757
I mean, couldn't we--

858
01:09:20,857 --> 01:09:25,195
I didn't seem to be
getting through to you, do I?

859
01:09:25,295 --> 01:09:29,666
You see, Haber,
I'm not asking you.

860
01:09:34,137 --> 01:09:35,639
I'm telling you.

861
01:09:38,742 --> 01:09:42,446
You go up there.

862
01:09:42,546 --> 01:09:47,016
Or I'm gonna fucking put
an end to your career

863
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:49,018
right here and now.

864
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:50,687
Move!

865
01:09:50,787 --> 01:09:51,621
You move!

866
01:10:10,106 --> 01:10:11,608
[click]

867
01:10:23,753 --> 01:10:24,588
Now.

868
01:10:27,291 --> 01:10:30,260
Wait, I'm a police officer!

869
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:34,731
Officer Haber, Officer
Mann, Officer Ruben.

870
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:37,634
We'd like to speak to you
about a man named Fisher.

871
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:43,707
Far enough!

872
01:10:43,807 --> 01:10:45,909
May we come in?

873
01:10:46,009 --> 01:10:49,779
You can come forward, but
those two stay where they are.

874
01:11:32,689 --> 01:11:34,958
[gunfire]

875
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:57,280
Help!

876
01:11:57,381 --> 01:11:59,849
Help me!

877
01:11:59,949 --> 01:12:00,850
Help me!

878
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:17,233
Well, it appears we have
underestimate Mr. Keller again.

879
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:18,868
Shut up.

880
01:12:18,968 --> 01:12:23,507
Keller, just give us
the money, and we'll go!

881
01:12:23,607 --> 01:12:25,909
Just like the original deal!

882
01:12:26,009 --> 01:12:29,679
Yeah, was rape part
of the original deal?

883
01:12:29,779 --> 01:12:32,382
Just call that
a fringe benefit!

884
01:12:32,482 --> 01:12:34,350
No extra charge
for that, soldier.

885
01:12:38,522 --> 01:12:40,990
I'm sick of playing
with those assholes.

886
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:43,593
[gunfire]

887
01:13:23,366 --> 01:13:24,200
I'll get the others.

888
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:25,134
Let's go.

889
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:31,908
We've lost.

890
01:13:32,008 --> 01:13:34,043
I think we should
pull back and regroup.

891
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:35,011
What are doing?

892
01:13:35,111 --> 01:13:36,746
Turning chicken, right?

893
01:13:36,846 --> 01:13:39,282
I knew you were
nothing but a pussy.

894
01:13:39,382 --> 01:13:40,850
I'd much rather be alive.

895
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:42,385
[laughter]

896
01:13:42,486 --> 01:13:43,720
I'd much rather be
alive, wouldn't you?

897
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:46,556
If you wanna regroup,
then fucking regroup!

898
01:13:56,966 --> 01:13:57,801
Richardson!

899
01:14:02,238 --> 01:14:03,439
You think you're smart.

900
01:14:06,309 --> 01:14:08,177
but you're not.

901
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:11,114
What?

902
01:14:11,214 --> 01:14:12,448
You're not smart.

903
01:14:16,019 --> 01:14:19,923
You of all people should
know that you can't leave me.

904
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:24,861
Oh, Jack.

905
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,770
[gunfire]

906
01:14:45,949 --> 01:14:50,219
Does anybody
else want to leave?

907
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:53,156
Hm?

908
01:14:53,256 --> 01:14:57,060
Jack, Jack.

909
01:14:59,763 --> 01:15:00,897
Look, I was thinking.

910
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:03,867
If-- if we could put
those lights out,

911
01:15:03,967 --> 01:15:05,702
it'll be a little easier
for us to get around.

912
01:15:30,293 --> 01:15:31,795
Shit!

913
01:15:31,895 --> 01:15:32,762
Now what?

914
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:34,163
I don't know, Michael.

915
01:15:34,263 --> 01:15:35,298
I guess we think like bats.

916
01:15:49,412 --> 01:15:50,479
Something's moving out there.

917
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:51,615
John, look out!

918
01:15:56,519 --> 01:15:58,421
Come on, John!

919
01:15:58,521 --> 01:15:59,555
No.

920
01:16:04,027 --> 01:16:06,362
John, please.

921
01:16:06,462 --> 01:16:07,263
Get up!

922
01:16:10,033 --> 01:16:10,834
No!

923
01:16:14,537 --> 01:16:17,006
Motherfuckers!

924
01:16:17,106 --> 01:16:19,609
[yelling]

925
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:24,614
Little prick!

926
01:16:35,992 --> 01:16:37,293
Hey, Harry.

927
01:16:37,393 --> 01:16:40,063
Do you like the beach?

928
01:16:40,163 --> 01:16:42,465
What the fuck are you
talking about, Michael?

929
01:16:42,565 --> 01:16:44,033
I was just wondering.

930
01:16:44,133 --> 01:16:46,102
Ow!

931
01:16:46,202 --> 01:16:47,036
Ow!

932
01:17:04,821 --> 01:17:06,990
I smell gas.

933
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:07,891
Yeah.

934
01:17:13,763 --> 01:17:14,864
Shit, it's on fire!

935
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:27,176
Michael!

936
01:17:49,465 --> 01:17:51,234
Whoa!

937
01:17:51,334 --> 01:17:55,538
I finally get to meet
the great musician.

938
01:17:55,638 --> 01:17:56,672
Let her go, Fisher.

939
01:17:56,773 --> 01:17:58,241
She's got nothing
to do with this!

940
01:17:58,341 --> 01:18:01,945
Oh, on the contrary, she has
everything to do with this.

941
01:18:02,045 --> 01:18:04,447
You see, when I have
finished with you,

942
01:18:04,547 --> 01:18:07,116
she's gonna be covering
for the Marissa.

943
01:18:07,216 --> 01:18:08,617
I no longer have.

944
01:18:08,718 --> 01:18:10,186
I can get the money.

945
01:18:10,286 --> 01:18:13,723
This is-- this is not
about money anymore!

946
01:18:13,823 --> 01:18:18,895
This-- this-- this
is about family.

947
01:18:18,995 --> 01:18:20,163
See, you took my family from me.

948
01:18:23,666 --> 01:18:25,534
Now you've-- you've got to pay.

949
01:18:25,634 --> 01:18:27,136
Hey, dip brain!

950
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,609
Lisa, come on!

951
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:34,744
Michael!

952
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:41,717
Down there!

953
01:18:54,197 --> 01:18:55,498
[screaming]

954
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:45,882
It's the last body, sir.

955
01:19:55,959 --> 01:19:57,894
Is there anything else you
want us to do before we go?

956
01:20:00,663 --> 01:20:02,098
Tom?

957
01:20:02,198 --> 01:20:02,832
Huh?

958
01:20:02,932 --> 01:20:04,400
What did you say?

959
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:08,237
Is there anything you want
us to check on before we leave?

960
01:20:08,337 --> 01:20:09,138
No, I guess not.

961
01:20:51,447 --> 01:20:53,950
[coughing]

962
01:21:19,308 --> 01:21:21,110
Aw man, I sure used to
love this fucking place.

963
01:21:31,854 --> 01:21:34,323
[laughter]

964
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:40,229
Here we are.

965
01:21:40,329 --> 01:21:42,065
Thank God.

966
01:21:42,165 --> 01:21:43,832
How about some breakfast?

967
01:21:43,933 --> 01:21:44,900
How about some fried eggs?

968
01:21:45,001 --> 01:21:46,302
What do you think?

969
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:47,370
[laughter]

970
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:48,271
Sounds great.

971
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,177
Oh, God.

972
01:21:54,277 --> 01:21:55,178
Oh, Harry.

973
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:02,518
So much for "home
sweet home," huh?

974
01:22:02,618 --> 01:22:03,619
And what is this?

975
01:22:03,719 --> 01:22:05,121
It's called "money."

976
01:22:05,221 --> 01:22:08,424
How's the Caribbean sound?

977
01:22:08,524 --> 01:22:10,393
Great.

978
01:22:10,493 --> 01:22:13,262
Michael!

979
01:22:13,362 --> 01:22:14,330
Are you serious?

980
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:16,199
Remember that boat
we talked about?

981
01:22:16,299 --> 01:22:16,899
Yeah.

982
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,535
We're getting it.

983
01:22:19,635 --> 01:22:24,373
Hey, this is Fisher's money.

984
01:22:24,473 --> 01:22:25,608
We earned it.

985
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:27,276
It's our money.

986
01:22:27,376 --> 01:22:27,977
Wrong.

987
01:22:28,077 --> 01:22:29,512
It's my money.

988
01:22:29,612 --> 01:22:31,914
Ah, who the hell is this?

989
01:22:32,015 --> 01:22:33,849
Hand it over.

990
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:37,420
Chief Detective Thomas Marsh.

991
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:41,057
You forgot to add,
formerly of the LAPD.

992
01:22:41,157 --> 01:22:43,659
Thanks to you, this
money is my ticket out.

993
01:22:43,759 --> 01:22:46,295
I can just see
the headlines now.

994
01:22:46,395 --> 01:22:51,400
Chief of detectives linked to
gangland figure in graft probe.

995
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:54,337
Not to mention accomplice
to how many murders, huh?

996
01:22:54,437 --> 01:22:56,239
Ah, yes, yes.

997
01:22:56,339 --> 01:22:59,942
Well, unfortunately, money
rather than duty calls.

998
01:23:00,043 --> 01:23:02,245
After all, this is
America, is it not?

999
01:23:02,345 --> 01:23:05,048
Yeah, now you know why
they call 'em "pigs."

1000
01:23:05,148 --> 01:23:06,749
You, pass me that money.

1001
01:23:12,055 --> 01:23:13,956
Easy now, cowboy.

1002
01:23:14,057 --> 01:23:15,058
Nice and easy.

1003
01:23:23,632 --> 01:23:26,335
That's very funny.

1004
01:23:26,435 --> 01:23:27,636
Well, it was nice meeting you.

1005
01:23:31,974 --> 01:23:33,008
Harry!

1006
01:24:15,118 --> 01:24:16,652
MICHAEL (VOICEOVER):
Well, I knew it would take

1007
01:24:16,752 --> 01:24:18,354
a miracle to bring Harry back.

1008
01:24:18,454 --> 01:24:20,256
And that's just what happened.

1009
01:24:20,356 --> 01:24:23,959
You know the old saying,
"old soldiers never die.

1010
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:25,994
They just go to the dogs."

1011
01:24:26,095 --> 01:24:27,896
On the beach, that is.

1012
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:29,632
Who says revenge isn't sweet?

1013
01:24:29,732 --> 01:24:31,234
[chuckling]

1014
01:24:49,152 --> 01:24:52,488
SONG: I was trying to
live my life alone.

1015
01:24:55,158 --> 01:25:01,063
Refusing to believe that
love could make me whole.

1016
01:25:01,164 --> 01:25:07,069
Still, it seems no
matter how I hide,

1017
01:25:07,170 --> 01:25:12,608
there's something in my
heart won't be denied.

1018
01:25:12,708 --> 01:25:19,982
It's the lonely love that
turns the world this way.

1019
01:25:20,082 --> 01:25:25,554
Changing night to day
when I lose my way.

1020
01:25:25,654 --> 01:25:31,294
It's the lonely love
that takes away the pain

1021
01:25:31,394 --> 01:25:34,730
and brings me home again.

1022
01:25:34,830 --> 01:25:37,266
It's the only love.

1023
01:27:03,752 --> 01:27:10,593
It's the lonely love that
turns the world this way.

1024
01:27:10,693 --> 01:27:16,565
Changing night to day
when I lose my way.

1025
01:27:16,665 --> 01:27:23,272
It's the lonely love
that breaks away the pain

1026
01:27:23,372 --> 01:27:25,774
and brings me home again.

1027
01:27:25,874 --> 01:27:30,679
It's the only love.
