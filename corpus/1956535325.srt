1
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,654
Hey, wake up!

2
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,125
Wake up!

3
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:40,491
Got somethin' in my eye...

4
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:48,616
Move along!

5
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,307
What is this place?

6
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,270
Why did you bring me here?

7
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:12,185
No more questions.

8
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,937
Turn around! = no.

9
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:21,031
Turn around!

10
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,364
No!

11
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,853
Here's your beers, guys.

12
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,240
Hello!

13
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:09,663
Hey!

14
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:11,953
No, the fashion
show is tomorrow.

15
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,205
Yeah, it starts at four o'clock.

16
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,002
Of course there is
gonna be girls here.

17
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,917
Why do you always do this to me?

18
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,041
Hey, hey!

19
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,377
Get the fuck out of here!

20
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,753
Did you have a good day?

21
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,932
Hey...

22
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:58,514
Boy!

23
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:01,817
Lookee here!

24
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:24,044
Hey, hey!

25
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,499
Get off of me!

26
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:33,517
Get off of me!

27
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,533
I'm here about the job.

28
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,076
That's good.

29
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,405
- I'm Kai.
- Henry.

30
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,706
Pleased to meet you.

31
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,996
You got to talk to
Rooter about that job.

32
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,043
He's in charge.

33
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,787
In there.

34
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,498
Good luck.

35
00:07:54,141 --> 00:08:01,229
Iwo toilets to northbound I 14
outside the 34 b exit?

36
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,806
For right now?

37
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:07,526
I'll see what can do.

38
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:10,650
Two standard units,
no sinks or anything?

39
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,652
For how long do you need them?

40
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,868
Thanks for calling!

41
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,166
Got a rush order, Rooter.

42
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,868
From who?

43
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,750
Frank, they're down at
the site working already.

44
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,874
His boys are gonna
have to hold it in.

45
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,833
Kai is going to
raceway park first.

46
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,669
They got a monster
truck pull tonight.

47
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:35,880
- Can anybody else go?
- No.

48
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,511
Abdulla and the taco boys
got hours of deliveries.

49
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:41,343
They're already
fuckin' late for...

50
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,311
Did you want to pay
a bill or something?

51
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:45,264
I saw your sign about the job.

52
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:48,608
The guy outside, Kai,
said to talk to Rooter.

53
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:50,273
I'm Rooter,
who the hell are you?

54
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,611
I'm Henry.

55
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,776
It's good to meet you.

56
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,948
Good to meet you, partner.

57
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,446
This is Cricket.

58
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,116
She's Kais old lady
in case you were getting any ideas.

59
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:01,617
Fuck you, Rooter.

60
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,490
Hello, Henry.

61
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,873
Uh, you want a job, huh?

62
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:09,421
I can handle just about
anything you throw at me.

63
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,840
Well, I just had
a guy quit on me

64
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,043
and work's starting to pile up.

65
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,003
So I'll give you a shot.

66
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,838
It pays uh $40 a day.

67
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,764
You gotta start now though.

68
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,730
Long day, huh? = not too bad.

69
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:13,811
Here you go. = thanks.

70
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,693
Used to do
construction before this.

71
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:19,274
Drove a mixer.

72
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:22,119
Getting laid off in the
winter was the pits though.

73
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:24,993
There wasn't always
work in the summer either.

74
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,658
And when I don't work I drink.

75
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:35,124
Kai?

76
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:37,255
I need to rent a room,
a cheap one.

77
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:39,211
You mean a sleeping
room or something?

78
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:42,639
Yeah. Something close to work.

79
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:45,468
That's rough...

80
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:47,344
Let me think about it.

81
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,311
Have anywhere to stay tonight?

82
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,239
Bet that shower felt good.

83
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,783
Kai's old clothes
look good on you.

84
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,367
Dig in before it gets cold.

85
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,043
I appreciate you taking me in.

86
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,961
We couldn't just let
you wander the streets.

87
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,755
We know what it's like
to be broke around here.

88
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,972
When I get paid
I'd like to give you some rent.

89
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,850
It's just till you
get back on your feet.

90
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:34,475
- Please!
- Okay.

91
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:38,062
Whatever you want.

92
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:41,107
I got to get you a set of keys.

93
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,199
So, Henry...

94
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,789
You have a woman
stashed somewhere?

95
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,415
Not at the moment.

96
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,293
A good-lookin' guy like you
doesn't have a girl?

97
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,008
Me and Cricket been
married 10 years now.

98
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,806
You're lucky to have
such a pretty wife.

99
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,099
Thank you, Henry.

100
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:15,523
- How's the meat loaf?
- It's great.

101
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:23,566
Henry, this is my
sister's girl Louisa.

102
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:26,034
- Hi.
- Hi.

103
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:31,081
sit down and eat.
I'm not hungry.

104
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,370
Louisa is a great artist.

105
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:35,564
She helps out at the
handicapped school.

106
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,001
I forgot you had a night class,
how did it go?

107
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,376
It was alright.

108
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,959
She's a great artist.

109
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:43,840
Henry, you have to
see her drawings.

110
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,216
They're wild.

111
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,970
Makes you wonder what's going
on in that head of hers.

112
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:51,723
You're a jerk.

113
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,514
It's too bad she can't attract
a man to buy her artwork.

114
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:57,565
Make us a pile of money.

115
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:59,564
We could build a pool.

116
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,113
Or put an addition on the house.

117
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,402
Cricket!

118
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:07,613
Quit.

119
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:17,915
You must be tired, go lay down.

120
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,217
How you doing, Henry?

121
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:29,722
Martini night, Kai.

122
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,683
What did you put in
those drinks yesterday?

123
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,477
The usual shit, why?

124
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,267
I woke up in my
car this morning

125
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,232
in a bowling alley parking lot.

126
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,360
I'm going to get ready for bed.

127
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,569
Don't get too fucked up tonight.

128
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,120
Night, hon.

129
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:59,081
Henry's gonna be staying in our
extra room for a couple days.

130
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,958
Is that so?

131
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,000
I need to talk to you.

132
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,087
Let's go downstairs.

133
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,581
Kai leave already?

134
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:44,335
No, they went
in the basement.

135
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:48,051
Okay.

136
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,825
Let's go drink some Martinis.

137
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,197
Good man!

138
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,453
- You know where the spare room is?
- Yeah.

139
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,035
Cricket said to get her
a pack of cigarettes.

140
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:43,853
I have to get ready for school!

141
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:51,986
- Oh!
- It's all yours.

142
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,739
I left you some hot water.

143
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,083
- Morning!
- Morning!

144
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:07,539
Did you sleep alright?

145
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,920
Yeah, fine, thanks.

146
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:14,846
I made coffee if you want some.

147
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:16,719
I would, thank you.

148
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:36,944
Hey, you're running
a little late, aren't you?

149
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,700
I couldn't get in the bathroom.

150
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,952
You look thin.

151
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:45,205
You eating enough?

152
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,087
Are you taking your medication?

153
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,459
I don't need it anymore.

154
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,917
That's not what the doctor says.

155
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:54,378
I don't care what
the doctor says.

156
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:08,775
She's such a brat.

157
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,819
Hey, buddy!
Morning, hon.

158
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:02,828
That's a shitty job.

159
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,546
Hey, retardo! - Hey, ugly!

160
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,195
Look, it's the creature
from another planet.

161
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:16,676
Quit it! Assholes!

162
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,594
You're mental!

163
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:19,807
You're sick.

164
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:24,559
You little bastards!

165
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,012
Dork! Leave her alone.

166
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,440
Hey!

167
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:40,112
Find somebody else to pick on.

168
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,242
He pushed us.

169
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:56,802
Who do you think you are?

170
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:59,844
I'm telling my dad.

171
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,672
Thanks for helping, Henry.

172
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,473
You alright?

173
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:28,537
- Kai, get up here!
- What?

174
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,271
Those kids are back
with their parents.

175
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,245
Better go to your room.

176
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,053
What?

177
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,146
- Is this the guy?
- No.

178
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,516
Where's the jerk
who pushed my boys?

179
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:56,096
- What are you talking about?
- Liar!

180
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:57,506
Your neighbors
saw the whole thing.

181
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,610
What, are you fucking nuts?

182
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,607
Listen, assholes!
Your two little darlings

183
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:04,405
have been harassing my niece
and I want it stopped.

184
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:07,203
You're the assholes!
Oh, I'm gonna take you down.

185
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,539
Tell me where this guy is or
I'm gonna start busting heads!

186
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,702
Son of a fucking bitch!

187
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,075
Better listen to
him, he'll do it!

188
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:13,295
Oh okay, porky!

189
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:15,124
Stick a sock in her, will ya?

190
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,001
You' re dead. - Fuck him up!

191
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:18,798
Come on, bust my head!
I want you to!

192
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,625
Alright, get the fuck
away from my door.

193
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,127
You wear the pants
in the family?

194
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:23,678
- Fuck you!
- You're a slut.

195
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:32,391
Get away from the door
or I'll sick the cops on you.

196
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,230
I'll sick the
cops on you, bitch!

197
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,198
They're leaving.

198
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:50,655
His wife's wiping
the spit off his face.

199
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,743
Did you see that mother?
What a fuckin' cow!

200
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:56,544
You can come out now, Henry.

201
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,293
They got a lot of nerve!

202
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,123
Why don't you let
me kill that guy?

203
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:07,802
Oh yeah, then the cops would
have been over here for sure.

204
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:09,428
She's right.

205
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,100
You need anything
from the store?

206
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:16,268
No, thanks.

207
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,016
Can we go to the
art supply store?

208
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,776
So long as you don't
take two hours again!

209
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,025
Bye, Henry! - Bye!

210
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:27,733
Find what you're looking for?

211
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,949
I'm not a firebug.
I'm a torch.

212
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:39,908
I burn buildings to make money,
not to get my rocks off.

213
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,661
It's all about
insurance pay-offs.

214
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:45,789
How do you get your customers?

215
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,875
Rooter arranges all that junk.

216
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:51,051
I never meet
anybody face to face.

217
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:53,505
Anybody ever gotten killed
in one of these fires?

218
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:58,351
I don't burn apartment buildings
if that's what you're asking.

219
00:23:58,354 --> 00:23:59,469
How about coming with me?

220
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:05,525
I pay you 500 bucks.
I know you could use it.

221
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,394
And I could use the help.

222
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:08,853
You don't even know me.

223
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:12,065
Is cleaning out toilets for $40
a day all you want out of life?

224
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:13,946
Look...

225
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:18,121
I can tell you're probably smarter
than a lot of guys I run into.

226
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:24,202
I need to work with someone
with a few brain cells left.

227
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,460
Think it over!

228
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:31,759
I'm leaving at 3:00 a. M.
If you want to come with me.

229
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:05,205
Pilot lights have
to be blown out first.

230
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,501
They could ignite the chemicals
we're gonna lay down.

231
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:33,692
An exterminator tank?

232
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:35,864
For spraying the floor.

233
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:39,452
I always drop off my supplies
at least a week in advance.

234
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:44,449
Don't want to be carrying this stuff
in my car when I'm doing a job.

235
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,246
Somebody lets you in?

236
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:49,204
Everyone thinks
I'm making a delivery.

237
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,171
They don't know what of.

238
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:03,593
- What's that?
- Accelerant.

239
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:06,896
Makes the fire burn quicker?

240
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:10,107
Five million times quicker.

241
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,914
Let's move.

242
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,425
You sure it's gonna go up?

243
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:28,511
Oh yeah.

244
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:49,911
Engine company 25, we have a report
of a fire at the chateau restaurant.

245
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:54,249
Any other units close by?

246
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:56,376
Here's to raising hell...

247
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,504
Engine company 25,
you've got a hot still and box

248
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,176
going at the chateau restaurant.

249
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,387
The only thing that matters.

250
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:12,597
Had ten calls about this
baby already this morning.

251
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:15,559
Don't get your
panties all bunched up.

252
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,272
You want it?

253
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,774
I'll advance you on
the next couple of jobs.

254
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:24,529
Yeah, okay.

255
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,242
It's nice, Henry.

256
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,039
Go break her in.

257
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:42,961
This stuff has the same
chemical properties as rocket fuel.

258
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:45,304
It creates its own oxygen.

259
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:50,556
So I could start a fire in
outer space if I wanted to.

260
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:56,557
It burns at 7000 degrees,

261
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:59,561
hot enough to melt
a whole aeroplane hangar,

262
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:02,985
concrete, steel...

263
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:05,529
You'll get everything
in 15 minutes.

264
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,478
Somebody's back there.
Let's get out of here.

265
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:05,512
What for?

266
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:13,221
Come out of there.

267
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:18,226
Gene?

268
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,475
It's alright, Casey.
It's just the police.

269
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:24,320
Come out of there!
Okay, alright, don't shoot!

270
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:25,733
Are you cops?

271
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:31,451
Lie down on the floor,
on your stomachs.

272
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,955
Put your hands
behind your backs.

273
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,586
Engine company 14,

274
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:26,916
are there any companies available
to take in a fire at the abc warehouse?

275
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:29,669
Yeah, I've got it, engine 26.

276
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:33,381
Truck 3 available
to take in the fire.

277
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:34,601
What are we gonna do?

278
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:37,851
Please watch out for truck
7 responding immediately.

279
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,780
Your turn.

280
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:04,355
Maybe there was some other way.

281
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,641
There was no other way.

282
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:11,361
Why did they have to pick
that building to camp out in?

283
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:16,112
I'm sure they would've made other plans
if they knew we were coming.

284
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:23,248
I'v e.

285
00:33:23,252 --> 00:33:25,743
Never killed anybody before.

286
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:30,505
We could get lethal
injections for this.

287
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:32,208
You know that, don't ya?

288
00:33:32,428 --> 00:33:34,464
Nobody's gonna miss those two.

289
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:40,884
So I hear you and
Kai like to start fires.

290
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,477
Excuse me?

291
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,226
No use denying it.

292
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:48,603
Kai told me everything.

293
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:54,693
Welcome aboard, Henry.

294
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,033
Be cool and you
make some money.

295
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,619
Fuck up

296
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:03,705
and I'll kill ya.

297
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:13,382
From now on you
keep your mouth shut.

298
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:17,928
You keep your mouth shut.

299
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:21,507
He's the boss,
it's his operation, remember?

300
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:24,969
I just hope he don't
find out about them kids.

301
00:34:25,189 --> 00:34:27,555
We'll all be sunk.

302
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:30,524
You had no right
telling him about me.

303
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:36,072
He didn't have a problem
about you and me working together.

304
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:37,648
He likes you.

305
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,240
Slimy derelict!

306
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,732
Hey, guys!

307
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:02,903
You guys wanna buy some acid?

308
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,361
He just made some up on the way.

309
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:07,663
We're gonna try it out
at the fire pit later.

310
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:09,227
You know I nearly
had a heart attack

311
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:11,958
last time I took that shit.

312
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:13,832
How bout you?

313
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,339
No.

314
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:19,838
What a couple of pussies.

315
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:22,089
Hey, wanna go see my new truck?

316
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:23,633
Sure!

317
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:44,533
Goddamn it, Kai.

318
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:46,401
I ain't cleaning
it up this time!

319
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:33,291
These are good. - Thank you.

320
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:37,836
Have you ever tried to draw?
Me? No.

321
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:48,347
I teach this at school.

322
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:50,514
I can't draw.

323
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:54,728
Just try it. - Okay.

324
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:17,910
Let me see.

325
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,246
- No.
- Henry...

326
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:29,714
Hey! This is good!

327
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:32,091
Really?

328
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:34,802
Yes, I like it.

329
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:37,805
It's a mule I had
when was a kid.

330
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,772
Called him rocks,

331
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:42,897
on account of he
used to eat rocks.

332
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:46,897
He wasn't right in the head but
he was still my favorite animal.

333
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:51,493
You lived on a farm?

334
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:59,496
- Sort of.
- Can I keep it?

335
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,245
I don't want it.

336
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,722
This is mother.

337
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,440
She ran off on me

338
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:23,483
five and a half years ago.

339
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:26,607
She and her boyfriend
did a lot of drugs.

340
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:30,236
Maybe she'll come back?

341
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:33,781
Li Don t think so.

342
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,119
Il was so mad when
she didn t come back.

343
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:41,789
I cut my wrists. See?

344
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:52,379
I got real close
to killing myself.

345
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:55,098
Really?

346
00:39:55,519 --> 00:40:03,519
I was in a motel room with a pistol at
my head and my finger on the trigger.

347
00:40:05,529 --> 00:40:05,893
I was in a motel room with a pistol at
my head and my finger on the trigger.

348
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:09,021
Why were you gonna do it?

349
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:11,948
I kept thinking about Becky.

350
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,776
Was Becky your wife? = no.

351
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,827
She was murdered.

352
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,622
Her and her brother Otis.

353
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:24,420
Becky's body was found
chopped up in a suitcase.

354
00:40:24,423 --> 00:40:28,416
They never caught
the guy who did it.

355
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:32,093
No evidence, no clues.

356
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:36,340
Are the police still
looking for the killer?

357
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:37,932
I don't think so.

358
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:41,355
That's evil.

359
00:40:44,693 --> 00:40:49,778
Why didn't you do it?

360
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,193
Why didn't you kill yourself?

361
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:55,321
Why should 1?

362
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:59,405
There's plenty of people
out there who hate me.

363
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:02,241
I can't let them win.

364
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:10,874
That's the last of the
expensive stuff, right?

365
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,550
Yep, right.

366
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:18,173
Get it on the truck.

367
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:20,304
This place is going up.

368
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:27,792
Come on, get him.

369
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,120
Remember me?

370
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:32,372
You're gonna be
sorry you done that.

371
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:35,091
For my boys!

372
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:37,043
For my wife!

373
00:42:37,264 --> 00:42:39,129
Fucking pig!

374
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:41,180
For your bitch!

375
00:42:53,989 --> 00:42:55,980
I kicked ass.

376
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:00,905
Cocksucker!

377
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:05,489
Real fair!

378
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:06,824
Three against one!

379
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:08,624
Fuck you!

380
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:13,087
Shit!

381
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:15,749
Three against one!

382
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,466
I'm gonna get that bastard!

383
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:19,886
I'll burn all their
fucking houses down.

384
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:22,805
Sure you will.

385
00:43:26,146 --> 00:43:27,682
I've got another idea.

386
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:35,560
Why did you pull in here?

387
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:39,989
What's up?

388
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:42,567
You wanna get somebody?

389
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:46,496
How about him?

390
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:49,040
I'll start it and you join in.

391
00:43:49,044 --> 00:43:51,160
You're serious?

392
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:52,957
You don't know him,
he don't know you.

393
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:55,125
It's a perfect set-up.

394
00:43:55,342 --> 00:43:57,549
Let's go inside.

395
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:59,884
Okay.

396
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:59,545
I can't believe
I did that last night.

397
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:04,755
You did it alright.

398
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:08,338
Next time

399
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:11,182
it'll be even easier.

400
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:18,810
Hi, guys.

401
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:20,142
Where were you?

402
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:22,067
Shopping.

403
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:39,794
Did you stop at the bar too?

404
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:49,800
Your bruises make
you look so tough.

405
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,925
I am tough.

406
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:09,570
Yeah, let's go to bed.

407
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:30,799
Can you guys do us a favor?

408
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:33,506
Sure.
We were gonna get some vodka

409
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:35,258
but they wouldn't take my ID.

410
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:37,685
What's your pleasure?

411
00:47:37,689 --> 00:47:39,475
Two fifths and some tonic.

412
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:43,525
No, it's on us, it's on us, go.

413
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:47,524
We'll be in the parking lot.
Ready?

414
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:48,980
We'll take care of ya...

415
00:47:59,878 --> 00:48:03,712
Why don't we go back to
our place and have a party?

416
00:48:03,715 --> 00:48:05,455
Aren't you guys
married or something?

417
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:08,007
- No!
- No way!

418
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:09,379
Do you have any pot?

419
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:10,627
He does.

420
00:48:10,847 --> 00:48:11,882
The best

421
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:15,382
about five minutes from here.

422
00:48:15,602 --> 00:48:16,967
Alright!

423
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,470
Oh, there's Lars.

424
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:21,812
The vodka?

425
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:40,330
Damn you!

426
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:42,204
What did I do?

427
00:48:58,186 --> 00:49:00,768
What do you want?

428
00:49:00,772 --> 00:49:05,357
Mother came to visit me.

429
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:11,026
She had worms all over her face.

430
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,026
It was just a bad dream.

431
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:15,696
- Go back to sleep.
- No, I won't.

432
00:49:15,703 --> 00:49:19,366
- Quiet!
- I'm scared, Henry!

433
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:23,040
- Can't I stay with you?
- No.

434
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:25,330
Why not?

435
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:27,411
Go back to your own bed.

436
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:33,127
Henry, she was in my room
and she was dead.

437
00:49:33,346 --> 00:49:35,462
Henry, you have
to let me stay here.

438
00:49:35,682 --> 00:49:38,719
If you don't let me
stay here, I die.

439
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:41,893
I swear my heart
will just stop beating.

440
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:53,108
Alright but you
have to be quiet.

441
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:34,444
It's time!

442
00:51:16,908 --> 00:51:19,399
Good morning.

443
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:20,950
Hi, hon.

444
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:24,495
- How did it go?
- Fine.

445
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:28,040
I'm gonna go take a shower.

446
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:50,388
You guys had to go far?

447
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:57,354
A hundred and
twenty miles each way.

448
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:01,740
It's too bad we're
so busy at work.

449
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,488
You could sleep in.

450
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:07,033
Looks great!

451
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:13,369
- Hi, Louisa.
- Hi.

452
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:15,875
I gotta get ready.

453
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:25,381
She's such a phony.

454
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:32,063
Where did you go last night?

455
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:35,017
Couldn't sleep.

456
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:37,978
There's no school today.

457
00:52:37,989 --> 00:52:39,695
I'm gonna come
visit you at work.

458
00:52:48,249 --> 00:52:51,161
I'm real busy today.

459
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:54,164
Maybe some other time.

460
00:52:54,172 --> 00:52:59,383
Oh, okay.

461
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:28,695
- How did you get down here?
- Bus.

462
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:31,539
What are you trying to pull?

463
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:34,914
Henry doesn't want you!

464
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:38,212
We slept together last night!

465
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:41,257
- Go home right now.
- No.

466
00:53:41,469 --> 00:53:44,211
I came here to see Henry.

467
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:46,466
No, I won't go! No, I 't go!

468
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,513
What are we gonna do
about Henry and Louisa?

469
00:55:56,729 --> 00:55:58,811
I don't know.

470
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:01,765
The last thing we need
is for her to have a kid.

471
00:56:01,776 --> 00:56:03,892
I know.

472
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:07,023
I just can't throw him out.

473
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:11,365
I want him out of here
by the end of the week

474
00:56:11,577 --> 00:56:13,363
or I'm leavin'.

475
00:56:13,371 --> 00:56:15,578
Bullshit.

476
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:17,781
I'm serious.

477
00:56:17,792 --> 00:56:19,908
Quit telling me what to do!

478
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:22,038
1 want him out of here.

479
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:24,082
This is my house too.

480
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:30,001
You know what, Kai?

481
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:33,213
You got nothing going on.

482
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:35,388
You're a loser.

483
00:56:35,393 --> 00:56:40,729
You're a pathetic fuckin' loser.

484
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:45,354
Smart ass bitch!

485
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:48,231
Don't you ever shut
your goddamn mouth?

486
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:49,900
Kai?

487
00:56:56,831 --> 00:57:00,790
God, I'm sorry, hon.

488
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:03,913
I never done nothing
like that before.

489
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:07,668
I'll never do it
again, I promise.

490
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:11,375
If you want Henry out,
he's gone.

491
00:57:15,266 --> 00:57:16,676
Come on.

492
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:39,487
Can I talk to you for a second?

493
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:53,550
Cricket wants you out of the
house by the end of the week.

494
00:57:53,554 --> 00:57:55,670
You kicking me out?

495
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:58,973
You can afford
your own place now.

496
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:04,471
Cricket knows how you been
having your fun lately?

497
00:58:04,482 --> 00:58:07,815
It's time for me
to get movin' on.

498
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,979
Don't worry, leave
at the end of the week.

499
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:11,693
Thanks.

500
00:58:11,906 --> 00:58:14,739
How about we go out tonight?

501
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:26,375
- Go ahead.
- No.

502
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:27,667
We're going upstairs.

503
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:30,083
Try anything and your wife dies.

504
00:58:30,299 --> 00:58:32,460
Okay. Okay, please don't hurt us.

505
00:58:56,784 --> 00:59:03,826
Please... please...
No... no... no!

506
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:39,573
Why d'you leave?

507
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:50,744
Here, smother her.

508
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:12,939
I don't want to do this.

509
01:00:20,868 --> 01:00:22,904
You think that she
won't identify you?

510
01:00:24,455 --> 01:00:26,320
You woman!

511
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:29,122
You cowardly little girl!

512
01:00:29,335 --> 01:00:31,872
Mr. big bad arsonist!

513
01:00:31,879 --> 01:00:35,292
You fuckin' animal!
You're crazy!

514
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:37,668
You animal!

515
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:41,002
You have to tie somebody to the bed
and cut their fuckin' head off!

516
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:13,583
Ow!

517
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:20,962
I could kill you right now!

518
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:25,296
Do you want me to watch the life drain
out of your chicken shit little face?

519
01:01:27,518 --> 01:01:29,008
Do you want to die?

520
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:30,304
No...

521
01:01:30,521 --> 01:01:34,059
Henry, please no!

522
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:39,189
From now on
you do exactly what say.

523
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:43,690
When I say it. You got it?

524
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:46,616
Yes...

525
01:01:46,829 --> 01:01:49,445
Oh yes...

526
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:06,211
Thank you...

527
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,552
Oh...

528
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:04,361
Henry, are you alright?

529
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:06,980
Don't come in. - Why?

530
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:09,783
I'm really tired, Louisa.

531
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:12,532
I'm going to sleep now.

532
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:15,622
I thought you
might need something.

533
01:03:15,626 --> 01:03:17,412
I waited up for you.

534
01:03:17,628 --> 01:03:21,337
I just need to sleep now.

535
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:25,211
But 1 waited up for you.

536
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:28,294
Good night, Louisa.

537
01:03:28,514 --> 01:03:31,301
Good night, Henry.

538
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:48,355
Don't you look nice.

539
01:03:58,252 --> 01:04:00,709
I'm glad you're here.

540
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:07,211
I'm glad we're alone.

541
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:07,313
No.

542
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:10,233
Why not?

543
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,240
What's wrong with me?

544
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:18,324
You'd be better off if we
don't mess around, believe me.

545
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:27,917
Are you in love with Cricket?

546
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:30,340
No, I'm not in love with Cricket.

547
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:32,668
What, don't you like girls?

548
01:05:32,888 --> 01:05:35,300
Yes, I like girls.

549
01:05:35,515 --> 01:05:37,927
Then why won't you be with me?

550
01:05:42,356 --> 01:05:44,847
I'm a bad man.

551
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:48,191
- You shouldn't have anything to do with me.
- No, you're not.

552
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:51,736
Yes, I am.
You don't see it.

553
01:05:51,949 --> 01:05:56,283
But I wanted you to
take me away from here.

554
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:58,743
Away from this house.

555
01:05:58,956 --> 01:06:00,992
1 wanted us to be married.

556
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:04,116
That's not possible.

557
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:05,913
Yes, it is.

558
01:06:07,798 --> 01:06:10,881
I have to go now.

559
01:06:11,093 --> 01:06:12,799
Don't go.

560
01:06:12,803 --> 01:06:16,716
You're the only person
that I can talk to.

561
01:06:16,932 --> 01:06:20,641
I have to go pick Kai
and Cricket up at work.

562
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:22,760
They have a car!

563
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:24,060
It broke down last night.

564
01:06:28,402 --> 01:06:31,269
No! You're not going anywhere.

565
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:34,104
I don't want to be alive then.

566
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:37,566
I don't want to be here
anymore unless I'm with you!

567
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:39,818
You're twisting things
around in your head.

568
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:43,243
If you go I'll kill myself.

569
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:48,244
I don't want to be alive anymore,
I'm gonna kill myself.

570
01:06:48,255 --> 01:06:52,919
You're not gonna kill yourself.

571
01:06:54,261 --> 01:06:56,297
Get back here, you faggot!

572
01:06:56,513 --> 01:07:00,256
I'm gonna kill myself.
You hear me?

573
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:04,184
I'm gonna blow my
fuckin' brains out!

574
01:08:25,102 --> 01:08:27,809
You got beat up in a bar fight.

575
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:32,185
And last time you got beat
up by your neighbor.

576
01:08:32,192 --> 01:08:36,435
You lying sack of shit!

577
01:08:36,655 --> 01:08:40,694
Where d 'you get beat up?

578
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:46,286
They won't admit it.
But I know they must have been scrapping.

579
01:08:46,498 --> 01:08:47,783
Hey, where are you going?

580
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,660
To the John.

581
01:08:51,128 --> 01:08:53,494
I'm gotta go check the steaks.

582
01:09:20,407 --> 01:09:23,149
You shouldn't have done that.

583
01:09:23,368 --> 01:09:25,074
Mind your own business.

584
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:52,052
This is a good steak, isn't it?

585
01:09:52,272 --> 01:09:54,058
Really juicy!

586
01:09:58,361 --> 01:09:59,692
What's wrong with him?

587
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:05,607
You put something in my drink.

588
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:08,034
Who? Me?

589
01:11:06,263 --> 01:11:07,503
Come on in.

590
01:11:07,722 --> 01:11:08,722
Come!

592
01:11:16,064 --> 01:11:19,022
So how ya doin', kid?

593
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:23,564
Hmmm? You still flyin', huh?

594
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:28,149
Enjoying the ride? I knew you would!

595
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:41,670
You're the quiet type, huh?

596
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:49,629
I like that. Keep your mouth shut
and we get along just fine.

597
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:56,056
You come down in another...
fifteen hours.

598
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:04,230
I usually smoke weed
to take the edge off.

599
01:12:04,237 --> 01:12:06,319
It seems to help.

600
01:12:06,323 --> 01:12:10,191
Hey, let's burn one now!

601
01:12:45,445 --> 01:12:46,810
Oh no...

602
01:12:55,789 --> 01:12:57,950
Help me get him
into the bathroom.

603
01:12:57,957 --> 01:13:00,869
Why?

604
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:02,788
Gotta chop him up.

605
01:13:04,631 --> 01:13:06,246
Hello?

606
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:15,012
Rooter?

607
01:13:19,479 --> 01:13:20,479
Rooter?

608
01:13:22,107 --> 01:13:23,107
Rooter?

609
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:29,436
Kai!

610
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:34,816
What are you doin' here?

611
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:39,495
Where's Rooter?

612
01:13:39,707 --> 01:13:41,413
Upstairs.

613
01:13:41,626 --> 01:13:43,241
Hey, Rooter!

614
01:13:43,253 --> 01:13:45,244
You wake Cricket!

615
01:13:45,463 --> 01:13:47,124
Rooter!

616
01:14:23,585 --> 01:14:26,292
Did you know that
Rooter was gonna drug me?

617
01:14:30,133 --> 01:14:31,794
Of course not!

618
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:43,472
Good thing.

619
01:15:41,538 --> 01:15:43,244
Henry?

620
01:15:49,212 --> 01:15:52,045
I want to show you something.

621
01:15:52,257 --> 01:15:54,498
No, don't.

622
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:57,083
Louisa, stop it!

623
01:15:57,303 --> 01:15:59,669
Henry hates me.

624
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:02,175
I don't hate you.

625
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:04,299
I'm not afraid to die.

626
01:16:11,401 --> 01:16:13,733
You don't want to die.

627
01:16:13,945 --> 01:16:15,606
Yes, I do.

628
01:16:15,822 --> 01:16:17,358
Louisa, please don't do this.

629
01:16:17,574 --> 01:16:19,064
Please don't hurt yourself.

630
01:16:19,075 --> 01:16:21,236
You don't care what happens to me!

631
01:16:21,452 --> 01:16:24,990
You all will be so sorry!

632
01:16:25,206 --> 01:16:26,742
Did Henry do something to you?

633
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:28,114
Louisa, please!

634
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:31,076
That's my gun.
Please give it back to me.

635
01:16:31,296 --> 01:16:34,003
Louisa, you remember
what we talked about?

636
01:16:34,215 --> 01:16:36,922
I don't have to listen
to anybody anymore!

637
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:40,089
Give me my goddamn gun!

638
01:16:40,305 --> 01:16:43,263
This is for you, Henry.

639
01:16:43,266 --> 01:16:45,382
No!

640
01:16:57,196 --> 01:16:58,982
I'm gonna bring her
into the bedroom.

641
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:11,119
It is my fault.

642
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:15,871
I should have listened to her.

643
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:19,548
And now she's gone.

644
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:52,745
Get away from her!

645
01:18:08,309 --> 01:18:10,095
Henry, no...

646
01:18:54,188 --> 01:18:56,850
Don't...

647
01:18:57,066 --> 01:18:58,556
Please don't!

648
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:03,061
Don't burn me!

649
01:19:05,992 --> 01:19:08,108
Please don't let
me die like this!

650
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:18,868
Henry...

651
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:21,295
Open up!

652
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:27,627
Open the door!

653
01:19:34,312 --> 01:19:35,927
Please!

654
01:19:37,607 --> 01:19:40,064
Open the door!

655
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:56,238
Please, let me out!

656
01:19:59,837 --> 01:20:01,077
Henry!
