31
00:02:29,433 --> 00:02:32,925
- I made him myself.
- Hey!

32
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:49,177
Ooh, I like it when they squeal.

33
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:51,278
Hey. Wait a minute.

34
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:56,283
<i>What's goin' on?</i>

35
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,854
Ahh. Perfect. Julius! Julius, baby.

36
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:04,662
Daddy's found you a brand-new brain.

37
00:03:04,735 --> 00:03:07,727
- Wait! You're not really gonna...
- Put your brain in his body?

38
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:10,136
<i>That's right!</i>

39
00:03:27,224 --> 00:03:33,129
<i>Oh, I don't feel like myself. I...</i>

40
00:03:33,196 --> 00:03:37,064
Oh, my gosh! I'm not myself.
That crazy gizmo really worked.

41
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,796
Oh, Doc. Doc! Doc, look.
Look. I changed my mind.

42
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,829
I don't want the money.
I want my old body back.

43
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,439
<i>Wait. Stop!</i>

44
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:54,746
Uh... You, monster.
Me, Mickey. Mickey Mouse.

45
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:58,845
<i>You know, uh, Mickey Mouse.</i>

46
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:02,050
Just look in my wallet. You'll see.

47
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,320
That's old. Ha.

48
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:06,385
There's me, next to my girlfriend
Minnie.

49
00:04:06,463 --> 00:04:08,454
Oh, Minnie.

50
00:04:08,532 --> 00:04:11,558
Yeah. And she likes
my body and my mind.

51
00:04:11,635 --> 00:04:13,626
In the same place, that is.

52
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:18,535
Minnie. Minnie. Minnie.

53
00:04:20,277 --> 00:04:23,178
Stop! Thief!
Where are you going with my body?

54
00:04:23,246 --> 00:04:27,273
We gotta switch back our brains!

55
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,154
Minnie.

56
00:04:36,226 --> 00:04:40,856
Cute suit. Not on my paycheck.

57
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:44,924
<i>Oh, my.
What would Mickey think?</i>

58
00:04:46,236 --> 00:04:50,229
<i>Mickey!
Why, speak of the devil.</i>

59
00:04:51,675 --> 00:04:55,304
Not till we're on the boat.

60
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,142
Minnie, it's a monster!

61
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,645
Come on, Mickey! Let's get outta here!

62
00:05:04,754 --> 00:05:08,781
- That was close. I think we lost him.
- Minnie!

63
00:05:08,859 --> 00:05:10,292
- Help!
- Stop!

64
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,351
<i>Help!</i>

65
00:05:12,429 --> 00:05:15,830
- Minnie, stop. It's me, Mickey.
- Mickey?

66
00:05:20,003 --> 00:05:23,632
<i>Hang on!</i>

67
00:05:23,707 --> 00:05:29,270
- You'll be safe here.
- Go get him, Mickey! Rip his ears off!

68
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:59,204
<i>Hey! Let her go.</i>

69
00:06:15,158 --> 00:06:19,219
Hey, Julius. Let her go.

70
00:06:45,188 --> 00:06:48,248
That was close!

71
00:07:01,972 --> 00:07:07,433
<i>- Happy Anniversary, Minnie.
- You're so romantic.</i>
