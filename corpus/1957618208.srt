Why put Jessica 
Ann through this?

32
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:39,659
- This is Jessie's mother 
we're talking about.

33
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,327
And your sister.

34
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,329
- She tried to kill 
that little girl.

35
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:46,099

she's a sick woman.

Still, if I had my way they 
wouldn't be doing this.

- It's what they 
do to rabid dogs.

38

- Beth, your sister 
dies this afternoon.

39
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:58,978
She wants to say "Goodbye" 
to her daughter and you.

40
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:02,081
Are you going to deny her that?

41
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,683
Beth, look at me.

42
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,053
The woman I married 
wasn't cruel.

43
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,690
In fact, the woman I married 
is a sucker for sad movies.

44
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,560
Now, think about where we are.

45
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:19,666
- You're right, 
you're always right.

46
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,503
- Ooh, think about where we are.

47
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,671
- Here we have some cookies

48
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,372
on the table for you downstairs.

49
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,774
(pensive music)

50
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,377
Hey, slow down all 
of you, be careful.

51
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:51,664
- If you wanna stay.

52
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,334
- Well, no, I'm not hungry.

53
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,208
I don't have to watch 
them kill her do I?

54
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,010
- No, of course not.

55
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:07,847
- Good.

56
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,582
I'm not up for that.

57
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:10,516
- Well, it won't hurt honey.

58
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,086
They just give her a shot.

59
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:15,822
- Nothing is worse than a shot.

60
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:23,830
(alarm buzzing) 
(door slamming)

61
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:26,232
- I appreciate your efforts

62
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,368
on my client's behave Dr. Price.

63
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,604
(door buzzing)

64
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,806
With this new 
antipsychotic drug,

65
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:36,609
Mrs. Sterling could lead 
a normal productive life.

66
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:39,145
- Look, we're dealing 
with a reactionary,

67
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,380
lame duck governor.

68
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,514
He doesn't want to be remembered

69
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:44,884
as a guy who reprieved 
a killer mommy.

70
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,821
- A month from now 
we could be dealing

71
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,556
with a whole new administration.

72
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,625
Ekhardt, if we could 
just buy some time.

73
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:56,496
- Time for her runs 
out in about one hour.

74
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,633
(door buzzing)

75
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,568
Got to hand it to 
her, not a crack

76
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,671
in that mask of hers even now.

77
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,306
- Don't kid yourself.

78
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:07,407
You know her sister 
hasn't let her see

79
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,809
that little girl in months.

80
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,644
Her daughter means 
everything to Mrs. Sterling.

81
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:12,812
- Why blame her sister?

82
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,514
That child's mother saw 
her kill a man right

83
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,682
in front of her.

84
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:16,649
- Oh oh, is this 
the way you tried

85
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:17,483
to turn the governor around?

86
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,785
- Don't kid yourself.

87
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:22,555
Without Jessica Ann's testimony, 
mommy would've walked.

88
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:26,092
They didn't even charge 
her for the other murders.

89
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,026
- Hmm.

90
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:29,696
(pensive music)

91
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,931
Do you think she killed them?

92
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,566
Two husbands.

93
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,468
A teacher the, the one 
who denied her daughter

94
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:39,472
the outstanding award, 
and a, and a janitor.

95
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,675
- Don't ask me to 
betray my client,

96
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:45,945
and I won't ask you 
to betray yours.

97
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:51,751
- Ekhardt, if she's the 
monster everybody says she is,

98
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,556
then why do we both care 
about what happens to her.

99
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,024
- Because she's 
the damnedest case

100
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,426
either one of us ever had.

101
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:08,968
- Well, looks like the 
governor didn't name

102
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,771
Mrs. Sterling 
"Mother of the Year."

103
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,507
- Nobody likes a 
sore winner, March.

104
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:17,810
You really relish 
seeing a woman die?

105
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,278
- Yes.

106
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,080
This one I do.

107
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,281
- She, she in the chamber.

108
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,917
- No no no, she's in visitation.

109
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:26,853
Saying "Goodbye" 
to her daughter.

110
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,723
Very touching scene, 
right Lieutenant?

111
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,393
Between a mother and a 
child she tried to strangle.

112
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,561
- Oh, stop by my 
office, Anderson.

113
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:37,063
You two, March.

114
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,532
I'll get both you 
guys in group therapy.

115
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,200
There's no charge.

116
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:48,608
(tense music)

117
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,912
- I know there's nothing 
I can say to make it up

118
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:57,750
to either of you, but I've 
had a lot of time to think,

119
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:05,124
and when I look back on 
my life I see two people

120
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:10,129
that mean a lot to me. (sighing)

121
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,966
Beth, you were always there.

122
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,506
Thank-you.

123
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:28,548
(sighing) Jessica Ann, I,

124
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,219
I know you think I 
was gonna hurt you.

125
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,655
- You didn't hurt me, much.

126
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,661
- When I saw your 
face in the moonlight,

127
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:45,665
I couldn't hurt you, I 
could never hurt you.

128
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:49,001
You're a part of me.

129
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,269
- I know mommy.

130
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,606
- And I'm a part of you.

131
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:58,110
And I still will be, 
even if I'm gone.

132
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,282
- I know mommy, I know.

133
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,153
- It's time, I'm sorry.

134
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,396
- Who's your best friend?

135
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,898
- You are mommy.

136
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:22,502
- Who loves you more than 
anything on god's green earth?

137
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:23,903
- You mommy.

138
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,672
- That's right, that's right.

139
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,976
Don't ever forget it.

140
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:32,945
- I won't mommy.

141
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:36,082
- Let's go.

142
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:45,992
- Paul.

143
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:47,793
- Yes?

144
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:53,266
- I er, I know I haven't 
been very warm to you.

145
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:54,767
- Oh, why should you be.

146
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,537
I make a small fortune 
writing your story,

147
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,872
then steal your sister from you.

148
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,774
- This was your doing 
today, wasn't it?

149
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:05,778
Talking Beth into letting 
me say, "Goodbye."

150
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,381
- Yes.

151
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:10,182
- Thank-you for that.

152
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,621
- Oh hell, it'll make a great 
scene if I write the sequel.

153
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:18,157
- Looks like a short sequel.

154
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,302
(chattering)

155
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,237
- Come on.

156
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:36,676
(typewriter clattering)

157
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,620
- What did she say to you?

158
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:48,754
- Goodbye.

159
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,159
- Are they gonna 
kill her in there?

160
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,126
- Oh no honey.

161
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:57,396
They take her to another 
room called the er,

162
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:00,132
the lethal injection chamber.

163
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:03,502
Different states do 
it different ways.

164
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:06,205
Do you know what a drip is?

165
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,273
- Yeah, him.

166
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:11,243
- Right, you have a point.

167
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,847
Anyway, in er, in some 
states they put an IV

168
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,617
in the person's arm and then

169
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:21,253
in the hanging plastic 
bag they put er...

170
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,188
- Poison?

171
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,827
Well, what do they 
do in this state?

172
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:31,163
- Well, it's like you said, 
er, they give her a shot,

173
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:36,402
and you're right, I'm sure 
it hurts like all shots hurt,

174
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,472
and then she goes to sleep.

175
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,307
- And never wakes up.

176
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,744
- Yes. 
(sad music)

177
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,278
- I know she did bad things.

178
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:50,216
Oh I know she did bad things, 
but I don't want her to die.

179
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:53,586
- I know you don't honey. 
- I prayed and prayed

180
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,954
they wouldn't kill her.

181
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,456
I prayed and prayed.

182
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,825
Do you think god heard?

183
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,994
- I'm sure he heard.

184
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,996
- But did he listen?

185
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,704
(trolley rattling)

186
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:28,154
- Neal.

187
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,524
- Anything I can do for you?

188
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,693
- The envelope. 
- Yeah.

189
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,394
- I gave you. 
- Hmm.

190
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,465
- It's a list of 
safe deposit boxes.

191
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:43,836
Put everything into a 
trust fund for Jessica Ann.

192
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:44,970
- Done.

193
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,677
(sighing)

194
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,446
- Well, in this state 
you have the right

195
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:56,882
to have your personal 
physician present.

196
00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:00,486
You want me to-- 
- Ah, no, no John.

197
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,055
I don't want you to see this.

198
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:10,262
Thank-you for what you 
attempted to do, both of you.

199
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,346
(somber music)

200
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,236
(heart beating)

201
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,309
(door clicking)

202
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:00,813
- I understand you 
declined the chaplain.

203
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,282
- I'm at peace with myself.

204
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,519
- It's more than I can say.

205
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,463
- I'm a baptist, but thanks.

206
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,137
- The warden has to read 
something, officially.

207
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:32,578
- Mrs. Sterling. (coughing)

208
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:39,318
"In the name of the people, 
and the governor of this state,

209
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,620
"we carry out 
sentence on this day

210
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:45,958
"of May 17th for the 
capital crime of murder."

211
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,830
May god have mercy on your soul.

212
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,097
- And yours.

213
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,604
(door clattering)

214
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,345
(ominous music)

215
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,583
(bag creaking)

216
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,424
(plastic gloves snapping)

217
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,541
(tense music)

218
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:49,421
(bottles clattering)

219
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:58,764
if you don't mind my saying so,

220
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,433
you seem a little bit nervous.

221
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,802
- This will be over quickly.

222
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,004
Don't make it any 
harder on yourself

223
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,672
than it has to be.

224
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,111
- This is your first time.

225
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,113
- Please. 
- Mine too.

226
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:21,086
Afraid of infection?

227
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:24,523
- Please, I prefer we not talk.

228
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:38,904
(liquid squelching) 
(tense music)

229
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:44,109
- Don't, doctor, erm, I 
moment please, please.

230
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:51,250
I erm, I need to pray. 
(choir music)

231
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:53,552
I have to pray.

232
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,189
- All right.

233
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:03,395
- Just, unstrap my hands 
so I can fold my hands.

234
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,032
And bow my head 
and pray properly.

235
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,367
- I can't, that's, 
it's impossible.

236
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:11,870
- Oh please, please 
doctor, I, I have to pray.

237
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,206
I really, I need to pray.

238
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,176
Don't send me into darkness

239
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:20,145
without the word 
of god to guide me.

240
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:24,750
- I just can't. 
- Oh please. (crying)

241
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:31,190
Doctor, tonight when 
you try and go to sleep,

242
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,030
remember me, doctor.

243
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,532
Remember the woman you murdered,

244
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:44,169
whose pitiful last 
request, you refuse.

245
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:12,598
(door buzzing) 
(dramatic music)

246
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:14,967
I'm going to need a chauffeur.

247
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,869
Any volunteers. 
- You're not walking

248
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,938
out of here, you stop right now.

249
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,140
- The boys at med 
school are going

250
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,741
to have a familiar cadaver.

251
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:23,909
- Don't do this.

252
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:28,347
- Neal, I think from here on 
out I'll handle my own defense.

253
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,215
Dr. Price, are you 
up for driving?

254
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,418
- I I-- 
- Mrs. Sterling.

255
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,556
Mrs. Sterling.

256
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,063
(gun firing)

257
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:45,197
- Ow, ah.

258
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:51,804
- Don't just stand there, 
she need immediate attention.

259
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,339
- What's wrong, you okay. 
(prison alarm wailing)

260
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,608
- Now, na, never better.

261
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:04,883
What, looks like your client 
bought herself a reprieve

262
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,521
after all, Mr. Ekhardt.

263
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,427
- You know the law lieutenant.

264
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,397
- Yeah, can't execute a prisoner

265
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:22,034
until and unless they're 
perfectly healthy.

266
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,503
It wouldn't be civilized.

267
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,240
(Mrs. Sterling sighing)

268
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,911
(birds twittering)

269
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:40,152
(tannoy sounding) 
(voice inaudible)

270
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,561
- [Doctor] This is just a 
local to make the insertion

271
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,231
of the implant itself painless.

272
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,932
- Will there be a scar, doctor?

273
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:57,736
- Hmm, a tiny one, and a bit 
of a bump on your forearm

274
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:01,874
where the flexible silicone 
rod is tucked under the skin.

275
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,610
Now you understand, your 
medication will be released

276
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:08,313
continuously in a 
small, measured douse.

277
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:13,919
It's kind of like a 
time-release cold capsule.

278
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,220
- Will I still be me?

279
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,489
- Hmm, you're still you.

280
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,794
- New and improved, like 
a laundry detergent.

281
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:27,399
- You're violent behavior 
has a biochemical basis.

282
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,202
The anti-psychotic 
drug short-circuits

283
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,538
your aggressive impulses.

284
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:36,608
- Oh, I've always liked 
designer clothing.

285
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,677
Now, I'll have a designer brain.

286
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,612
My wardrobe will be complete.

287
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,548
- You had a choice, 
lethal injection

288
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:44,449
or that implant in your arm.

289
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,984
And you're still very 
much a trial case,

290
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:47,920
a a social experiment.

291
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,590
- A guineapig. 
- A live one.

292
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,492
Look, if this doesn't 
work, or if you get cute

293
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,093
and remove that implant, 
your next shot will be back

294
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,163
at state prison, or from 
that police sergeant's gun.

295
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,533
- Is it my fault his friend, 
Lieutenant March had a stroke?

296
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,535
- After the stress of 
your attempted jailbreaks,

297
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:07,406
Sergeant Anderson 
certainly thinks so yes.

298
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,710
- John, don't think 
I'm ungrateful.

299
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,312
(pensive music)

300
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,281
I know what you've done for me.

301
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,550
You saved my life.

302
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,193
- Now, do you have 
any questions about

303
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,062
how the implant's going to work?

304
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:35,367
- Well, I'm gonna have a better 
sense of right and wrong.

305
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,906
Hmm, you know, no man's ever

306
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:46,144
thought I needed 
implants before.

307
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:48,046
- I can believe that.

308
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:51,383
But you will have more 
normal emotional responses.

309
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,851
- Like you?

310
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:53,752
- Yes.

311
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,823
Now you have the address 
of that halfway house.

312
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:58,724
- Hmm.

313
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,361
What about my daughter?

314
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,364
How often can I see my daughter?

315
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,000
- You er, you can't.

316
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,537
- What? 
- I was hoping

317
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,772
with the implant would have 
more time to mellow you out.

318
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,275
- What do you mean, I 
can't see my daughter?

319
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:17,776
She's my daughter.

320
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:21,313
- Your sister got a court order.

321
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,681
It's a restraining order.

322
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:25,550
You're not to see Jessica Ann.

323
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,222
(chair squeaking)

324
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,890
Look I'm sorry darling.

325
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,558
Maybe in time we can 
turn this around.

326
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:37,062
I don't know, talk 
to your attorney.

327
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,664
Are you all right.

328
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:42,567
- I, (sighing) I think so.

329
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,538
- Are you crying?

330
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,447
(upbeat music)

331
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,386
(audience clapping)

332
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:04,690
- Paula Sands live, where 
your opinions count.

333
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:08,260
And here's the first lady of 
daytime talk, Paula Sands.

334
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,730
(audience applauding)

335
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,765
- Thank-you Brad, 
studio audience.

336
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:17,202
Today on the show we have a 
serious, even troubling topic.

337
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:20,505
I'm sure you all remember the 
so-called killer mommy case

338
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:23,308
that captured so much 
attention not long ago.

339
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:26,511
Well yesterday, the woman 
convicted of murdering her lover

340
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:28,914
when she discovered he was 
an insurance investigator

341
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,550
looking into the mysterious 
death of her husband,

342
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,418
the woman who murdered her lover

343
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:35,687
in front of her 11 
year old daughter,

344
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:38,724
a woman who police claim, 
though it was never proven,

345
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,293
tried to murder 
her own little girl

346
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,061
to silence her as a witness.

347
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:47,566
That woman, that mother 
was released yesterday.

348
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,534
And we have with us 
today, as our guest,

349
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:52,938
Jolene Jones, the sister 
of one of Mrs. Sterling's

350
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:56,108
alleged victims, a 
janitor at McKinley School

351
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:57,909
who died of electrocution.

352
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,912
Along with Ms. Jones, 
Paul Conway is also here.

353
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:03,815
He is the author of numerous 
successful true crime books

354
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,851
including "Conversations 
with Killers,

355
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,886
"True Stories of 
Murder for Hire."

356
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:10,856
And of course, his bestseller, 
this one right here,

357
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:14,826
16 weeks on the bestseller 
list, "The Mommy Murders."

358
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,495
Mr. Conway, it's nice 
to have you here today.

359
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,696
- Thank-you, it's my pleasure.

360
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:19,598
- You are here not 
so much as an expert

361
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,533
on this case today, 
but as a representative

362
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,903
of Mrs. Sterling's family, 
you are indeed married

363
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,539
to the sister of this 
convicted killer.

364
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:28,940
- Yes, that's correct.

365
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:31,076
I met the entire family 
while I was doing research

366
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:34,479
on this case, and 
erm, my book erm,

367
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:37,916
which just came out in 
paperback by the way.

368
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:41,953
It tries to deal compassionately 
with this tragedy.

369
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,190
- (laughing) I'll tell you 
about tragedy, you (beeping)

370
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,927
What's tragic is my sister 
getting her (beeping) fried.

371
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,496
- Thank god for 
seven second delay.

372
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:53,498
- Thank the FCC.

373
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,033
This is great television.

374
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,701
- Excuse me Mrs. Sterling 
was never charged

375
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,036
for that offense.

376
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,838
- Oh, but your book 
indicates her probable guilt.

377
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,107
- Probably my (beeping) 
that psycho bitch is walking

378
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:05,477
the streets and my sister 
is six feet (beeping) under.

379
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,646
- Now wait a second, 
wait a second,

380
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:09,714
if your sister was 
indeed murdered,

381
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,850
and not killed in an 
unfortunate accident,

382
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,653
as the coroner ruled, well 
then she was a blackmailer

383
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:15,821
who was-- 
- Oh wait a second.

384
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,289
What, what are you 
saying, that she got

385
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:18,657
what was coming to her?

386
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:20,392
Lousy piece of 
New York (beeping)

387
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,595
You're making piles of money 
off my poor dead sister.

388
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:25,797
You're getting rich off 
other people's tragedies.

389
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,499
(television clicking)

390
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:30,202
- I told you we weren't 
going to watch that.

391
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:32,971
- Maybe you're not interested 
but I wanted to see Paul.

392
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,040
- He didn't want you 
watching either did he?

393
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:37,042
You heard him say things 
might get out of hand.

394
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:39,211
- That's why I 
wanted to watch it.

395
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:41,847
- I won't have you talking 
to me in that tone.

396
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:43,014
- You're not my mother.

397
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,183
- No but I never tried 
to kill you either.

398
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,886
(Jessica Ann sighing)

399
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:48,820
I'm sorry.

400
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,958
- It's okay, but I'm 
not a little kid.

401
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:55,527
I have a right to know 
what people are saying

402
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,229
about me and mommy.

403
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,432
- And there's something else 
you have a right to know.

404
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,435
It's what the court thinks 
about you and your mommy.

405
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,803
- What do you mean?

406
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,204
- The court has decided that you

407
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,840
and your mother shouldn't 
have any contact for awhile,

408
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:11,843
at least not until 
they're sure she's better.

409
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,778
- I can't even 
see my own mother?

410
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,347
- Do you want to?

411
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:16,882
- I don't know.

412
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:18,683
- That's a healthy 
attitude, Jessie.

413
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,486
- Huh, it should be up 
to me not some judge.

414
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,054
- I'm your guardian now, Jessie,

415
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:26,825
your legal parent, and 
frankly it's up to me.

416
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:31,329
- If I wanted to see mommy or 
talk to her, you'd stop me?

417
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,798
- When you're 18 you 
can decide for yourself

418
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,467
if you want a relationship 
with the woman

419
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,736
who killed your 
father and stepfather.

420
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:40,272
As long as you're 
my responsibility,

421
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:42,774
I can't allow you near her.

422
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:52,183
- Great, two psycho moms. 
(jingling music)

423
00:25:54,920 --> 00:26:00,158
(birds twittering) 
(people chattering)

424
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:11,236
(Mrs. Sterling sighing)

425
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:29,754
- Getting settled? 
- (gasping) Yes.

426
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:32,290
- Who checked you in, Mary?

427
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,224
- Why yes.

428
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,861
- I look familiar 
to you, don't I?

429
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,163
- Actually you do.

430
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:42,834
I'm sorry, it's this medication, 
I'm not quite myself.

431
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,439
- I'm Mrs. Evans, I used to 
be your daughter's principal

432
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:48,473
over at McKinley.

433
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,208
- Oh. 
- A lovely child.

434
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:54,980
- Of course, Mrs. 
Evans, how silly of me.

435
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:56,881
- I retired at the end 
of last school year

436
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,784
and now I'm helping out 
here at the halfway house.

437
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:02,253
- Good for you. 
- Yes isn't it.

438
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,689
I wanted to welcome 
you and to let you know

439
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:07,626
that I'll be watching you.

440
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:09,260
- Watching? 
- Mrs. Withers,

441
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:12,030
the teacher, she was 
a wonderful woman,

442
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:14,065
and one of my best friends.

443
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,167
- Okay, that was an accident.

444
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:20,505
- I know dear, you're 
innocent, like OJ.

445
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:21,906
(ominous music) 
I just wanted you

446
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,943
to know that it would give 
me the greatest satisfaction

447
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,480
to see you back on death 
row where you belong.

448
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:29,948
Good afternoon.

449
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:42,460
(lively music)

450
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:47,098
♪ Look so pretty in 
your lace and dress ♪

451
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,934
- I think you're dead 
wrong about this Beth.

452
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:53,338
- I won't have Jessie 
anywhere near that woman.

453
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:56,074
- Personally I think it would 
be good for both of them.

454
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,743
They both have a lot 
of healing to do.

455
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,011
- You're not the 
one who walked away

456
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:01,479
from that little 
girl and left her

457
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:03,782
in the care of a sociopath.

458
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,650
- Well honey, there was 
nothing you could do.

459
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,752
You had no legal 
right to intervene.

460
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:10,422
- I had a moral responsibility.

461
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:13,124
I knew my sister was 
potentially dangerous,

462
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,126
and yet I left that 
child in harm's way

463
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,729
because I was too afraid 
to stand up to her.

464
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,065
Well, I'm not afraid now.

465
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,634
- I don't wanna 
argue about this.

466
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,469
I'm just expressing an opinion.

467
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:28,306
You know, I'm Jessica 
Ann's legal guardian too.

468
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,108
- I know, I'm sorry.

469
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:40,685
- [Paul] I tell you for a 
beginner she's really very good.

470
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,187
She's got a lot of poise.

471
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:44,456
- [Beth] I don't know if 
this is so good for her.

472
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:46,891
- [Paul] Why, are you crazy?

473
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,893
- Every day she comes 
here to practice.

474
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,395
She's obsessed.

475
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:53,164
- Hmm, some obsessions 
can be healthy.

476
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:56,534
I, for example, am 
obsessed with you.

477
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,776
(chattering)

478
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:08,813
- Oops.

479
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,914
- Are you about ready to go?

480
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:10,849
- Can't I stay awhile?

481
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,418
Lessons don't start 'til six.

482
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:15,854
- Sure, we'll pick you up then.

483
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,822
- Aren't you going to 
watch me some more?

484
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:19,924
- Too cold for us non-Eskimos.

485
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:22,393
We'll see you at six honey.

486
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:37,041
(chattering)

487
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:41,412
(ominous music)

488
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:47,152
(suspenseful music)

489
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,058
- [John] You didn't talk to her?

490
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,528
- I just watched from afar.

491
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,566
- Well, I can't encourage 
you to talk to her.

492
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,735
Much as I, I personally 
think that's a healthy thing,

493
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:09,207
but to do so would 
be jeopardizing your 
outpatient status.

494
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:11,342
- You mean, they'll throw 
me back on death row.

495
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:12,277
- Yes.

496
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,813
There are a lot of 
people out there

497
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:16,548
who want to see you fail.

498
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:17,682
- Really?

499
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,284
I hadn't noticed.

500
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:22,854
- You want me to 
have you transferred

501
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:24,322
to another halfway house?

502
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:26,658
- Does a change of 
venue really matter

503
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:28,359
in a case this notorious?

504
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:29,527
No thank-you.

505
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:33,131
- You know, I would do anything

506
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,966
within my power to do for you.

507
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:37,268
- Well then, help me 
get my daughter back.

508
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,503
- Oh custody is out 
of the question.

509
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:42,140
- No no, not custody, 
I just wanna see her.

510
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:44,075
And I wanna talk to her.

511
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:46,644
I want Jessica 
Ann not to hate me

512
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:50,081
and I know Beth is saying 
terrible, hurtful things.

513
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:55,320
- Now look, just keep that 
pretty little nose clean,

514
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:58,623
and how knows in six 
months, or a year.

515
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:01,459
- Please.

516
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:07,298
- Something wrong? 
- I, I I just don't er,

517
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:12,704
(sighing) I just 
don't feel that way

518
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:15,039
about you anymore doctor.

519
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:22,447
Is that going to be a problem?

520
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:23,381
- No.

521
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:26,251
Not at all.

522
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:33,024
(frogs chirping) 
(door knocking)

523
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:33,892
- Got a sec, pal?

524
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,760
- Er, sure, come on in.

525
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:38,429
(light music)

526
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:44,569
I saw you on TV today, 
until Beth shut it off.

527
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,871
- Oh, I heard.

528
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:49,607
She's a little er, uptight.

529
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:50,642
- You think.

530
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,912
- Do me a favor, cut 
her some slack will you.

531
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:57,515
- Huh, she told me 
I can't see mommy

532
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:01,052
or to talk to her 
or anything ever.

533
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,387
- Ever?

534
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:05,423
- Tsk, well same 
as, 'til I'm 18.

535
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:09,727
- I think you're right 
wanting to understand

536
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:11,663
and forgive your mommy.

537
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:13,097
- Really?

538
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:16,334
Well, why can't we just 
invite her over sometime,

539
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:19,637
and just see how she's doing?

540
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:21,105
- You miss her.

541
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,875
- Well, she is my mother.

542
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:30,048
- Hmm, someday I'll get you 
two back together, I promise.

543
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:33,117
But until then you 
have to do me a favor.

544
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:34,485
- What Paul?

545
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:37,155
- Well, you have to put up with 
your Aunt Beth's commandment

546
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:38,856
about seeing your mother.

547
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:42,460
You do that for now and 
I'll work on later, okay?

548
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:43,895
- Okay. 
- Aunt Beth knows

549
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:48,099
that you love her, but she 
needs more from you Jessica.

550
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,735
She needs your respect.

551
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:51,636
- Why?

552
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,771
- Because she hasn't 
really learned

553
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:55,740
to respect herself yet.

554
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,177
Okay, we got a deal.

555
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:04,916
Goodnight pal.

556
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:09,387
(rink noise crackling) 
- Goodnight.

557
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:21,199
(chattering)

558
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,753
(ominous music)

559
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:06,444
- You look so beautiful 
out there, so graceful.

560
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:09,247
- I asked you once if 
I could take lessons,

561
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:11,816
but you said it 
was too dangerous.

562
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:15,253
- I know, your mother's 
made some mistakes dear.

563
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:18,356
- Huh, we're not 
supposed to talk.

564
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:22,427
- Do you think that should be 
anyone's decision but ours?

565
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:27,698
- No, but I don't want to get 
either one of us in trouble.

566
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,835
- (sighing) How are 
you doing in school?

567
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,603
- Okay I guess.

568
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,872
- What about your 
last report card?

569
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:36,741
Any Bs? 
- No, just As.

570
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,813
- Did they give an 
outstanding student award?

571
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,881
- No, they stopped doing that.

572
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:45,216
I have to go.

573
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,019
I have a private lesson.

574
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,754
- I'm proud of you.

575
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:52,356
- Excuse me, you're Mrs. 
Sterling aren't you,

576
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,825
Jessica Ann's mother?

577
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:54,759
- Er, yes.

578
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:57,962
- Do me a favor, Jessica Ann,

579
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:00,131
go practice our 
axels for awhile.

580
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:02,467
- Practice hard dear.

581
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:05,303
- [Instructor] Parental interest 
is something I encourage.

582
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:06,737
- Well, I'm glad to hear that.

583
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:09,474
- Normally, but I know all 
about you Mrs. Sterling.

584
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,477
I know about the 
restraining order.

585
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:15,379
- I, I just wanted to 
watch my little girl skate.

586
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,115
- Jessica Ann is in 
training, Mrs. Sterling,

587
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:18,483
for her first competition.

588
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:20,384
She doesn't need this 
kind of pressure.

589
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,320
- I wasn't hurting anything.

590
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:24,288
- I don't want to see 
you in here again.

591
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:27,592
If I do, I'll report 
you, understood?

592
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:32,663
- She's my daughter, daughter, 
daughter, daughter, daughter.

593
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,466
(pensive music)

594
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:46,377
(horn honking) 
(traffic rumbling)

595
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:59,624
(skates rumbling)

596
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:14,972
(ominous music)

597
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:18,109
- How long are you gonna work 
out in here tonight anyway?

598
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,244
- About an hour or so.

599
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:23,814
- Turn the lights 
out yourself then.

600
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:26,684
(dramatic music)

601
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:33,891
(ice crinkling)

602
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,451
- What the hell 
are you doing here?

603
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:01,986
Get off the ice.

604
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:08,426
(dramatic music) 
(blade smashing)

605
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:28,813
- (sighing) Oh you had 
nothing to do with this.

606
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:31,582
- Why would I harm a 
person I barely knew?

607
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:33,351
- (sighing) When it comes 
to shopping for murder,

608
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,086
you're something of 
an impulse buyer.

609
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:37,488
- I hope this doesn't impede 
Jessica Ann's progress

610
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:38,689
with her skating.

611
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,826
She has a competition 
coming up, you know.

612
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:43,628
- You were seen 
talking with her.

613
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:46,764
- I was there in the 
afternoon, just watching.

614
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:49,834
- I have witness 
statements Mrs. Sterling.

615
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,937
- I merely told Jessica 
Ann that we shouldn't talk,

616
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:55,573
that the court didn't 
want us to have contact.

617
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,241
- But you did have contact!

618
00:37:57,308 --> 00:38:00,578
- There was an 
inch of plexiglass 
separating us Sergeant.

619
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,513
- It's gonna have to be 
reported to the court.

620
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:06,350
- Don't you report all 
murders to the court?

621
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:09,353
- I am talking about 
seeing your daughter.

622
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,889
- Sergeant, a man is dead.

623
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,324
And you're concerned 
about keeping

624
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:14,925
a mother from her daughter.

625
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:16,494
Where are your values?

626
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,429
- And where were you at 
the time of the murder?

627
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:20,564
Let's cut the 
chitchat here lady.

628
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:21,699
- Haven't you heard?

629
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:24,035
I have an implant 
that makes me behave.

630
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:25,369
- You got an implant?

631
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:26,671
I tell you what I think.

632
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:28,639
I think you implanted 
that hockey skate

633
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:31,676
into that instructor's back 
37 times, that's what I think.

634
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:34,845
And I think that you could use

635
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:37,415
a better placed 38 
caliber implant.

636
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,483
That is what I think.

637
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,720
- How is Lieutenant March?

638
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:48,759
- He's paralyzed, he's 
a damned vegetable.

639
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:54,632
He's keeping company 
with the drool cup.

640
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:57,034
- Pity, such a lovely man.

641
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:01,505
Close the door on your 
way out will you sergeant.

642
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:04,141
I treasure what little 
privacy I have in this place.

643
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:07,411
(people chattering)

644
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:10,681
- Sure.

645
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:35,172
- Jessie, I have some 
very troubling news.

646
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:36,040
- What is it?

647
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:38,609
- Your skating 
instructor, last night--

648
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:40,411
(tense music) 
- What?

649
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:43,047
- Sergeant Anderson was here 
and he wanted to talk to you,

650
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:44,215
but I put him off.

651
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:45,182
- What?

652
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:46,817
Why, I'm not a baby.

653
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,453
- I know, but you've 
been through so much.

654
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,654
- Is mommy all right?

655
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,491
- Oh, she's all right, 
all right physically.

656
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:56,293
- Did something happen 
to my skating instructor?

657
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,561
- Yes.

658
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:59,063
- An accident?

659
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,799
- Not an accident, murder.

660
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:02,733
- Oh no.

661
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:07,238
- Ah, Jessie, I'm 
sorry, I'm so sorry.

662
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:08,973
- What happened?

663
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,574
- It's too horrible.

664
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,443
- What happened?

665
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,113
- Multiple stab wounds 
with, with a skate.

666
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:19,950
- You think mommy did this?

667
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:23,287
- You spoke to her yesterday 
didn't you, at the rink.

668
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:25,723
- Yeah, she was there watching.

669
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,992
I wasn't gonna pretend 
she didn't exist.

670
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:31,195
- [Beth] Your mother had words 
with your skating instructor.

671
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,563
- Not really.

672
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,632
He just told mommy 
not to come around,

673
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,434
'cause of the court order.

674
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,102
- Jessie, there are witnesses.

675
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:38,869
- To the murder?

676
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,471
- No, to you two talking.

677
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:41,705
Your mother screaming at you.

678
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,307
- She didn't do this.

679
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:44,875
- How can you be so certain?

680
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,677
- I just am. 
- She's probably going

681
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,813
to be back in prison very soon.

682
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:50,848
But in the meantime, under 
no circumstances are you

683
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:52,716
to have any contact with her.

684
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,151
- But Aunt Beth!

685
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:57,388
- If she walks up to you, 
walk away, do you understand?

686
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,522
Walk away.

687
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:11,869
- Woo woo woo, detective, it's 
a physiological impossibility

688
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,004
that Mrs. Sterling 
committed that murder

689
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:16,106
with that antipsychotic 
implant in her arm.

690
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:17,741
- How do you know 
it is in her arm?

691
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,610
- Because I saw 
her this morning.

692
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:23,414
Look, this is a rod 
underneath the flesh.

693
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,417
It's surgically implanted and 
replaced on a yearly basis.

694
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,685
It doesn't come with a zipper.

695
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,153
- Oh, that's cute.

696
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,422
Why are you standing 
up for this woman?

697
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,623
- Ah. 
- Huh?

698
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:35,626
Ever stopped to 
consider that er,

699
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:37,795
maybe this isn't a matter 
of science or medicine?

700
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:40,064
Maybe little mommy here doesn't 
have a chemical deficiency

701
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,200
in her brain but she has got 
a blackness in her heart.

702
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:45,870
- Are you looking for a vampire 
to drive a stake through?

703
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:48,105
This is a woman with an illness.

704
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,040
- Yeah yeah, and 
I've got the cure.

705
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:52,510
- Well, you'd make a fine 
frontier marshal there Max,

706
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:53,744
just not a very good detective.

707
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:56,280
- Nah, what are 
you talking about?

708
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,115
- The viciousness of 
this crime doesn't begin

709
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,018
to match Mrs. Sterling's 
psychological profile.

710
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:05,155
- Look, John she commits 
two kinds of murders.

711
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:09,894
Her calculated black 
widow style sendoffs

712
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:14,899
of her wealthy husbands, and 
her spur of the moment murders

713
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:19,737
of people standing between 
her and what she wants.

714
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:21,572
- And a skating instructor 
stood between her

715
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:22,940
and her precious daughter?

716
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:24,942
- Bingo. 
- You're forgetting one thing

717
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:28,779
detective, Mrs. Sterling 
is not sadistic.

718
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:30,948
She takes no 
pleasure in killing.

719
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:34,952
She simply removes obstacles 
as cleanly as possible.

720
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,221
And you blame her for 
your partner's misfortune.

721
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:39,390
- You bet your ass, 
you stop right there.

722
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:41,225
He had a stroke.

723
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:43,727
- And did Mrs. Sterling 
force-feed him four packs

724
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:46,230
of cigarettes a 
day for 40 years?

725
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:47,798
Or are you just a little 
bit more interested

726
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:49,700
in putting mommy away than 
you are in finding out

727
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:53,370
who's really responsible 
for this killing?

728
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:58,509
- You think?

729
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:02,079
(school belling ringing)

730
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:08,652
(chattering) 
(doors banging)

731
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:18,729
- Are you okay?

732
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:19,897
- Sure.

733
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:21,599
- Are you ready for 
the history test?

734
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:22,766
- I guess.

735
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:25,202
- You shouldn't listen 
to what kids say.

736
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,537
- Who says I listen?

737
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,973
- Nobody, I just thought at 
lunch you might have heard

738
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:30,774
this kid-- 
- What?

739
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:32,443
- Just don't pay any 
attention to them, that's all.

740
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:34,912
- (sighing) Whatever. 
- Jessica Ann, I, I'm sorry

741
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:37,648
I didn't meant to 
scare you, honey.

742
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:38,949
- You're not 
supposed to be here.

743
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:41,385
- I had to see you. 
- I'm not supposed to see you.

744
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,553
You're gonna go back to jail.

745
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,088
- That's why we have to talk.

746
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:47,758
You know, your skating 
instructor, that 
terrible accident.

747
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,159
- It wasn't an accident.

748
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:52,229
You don't accidentally get 
stabbed a hundred times.

749
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,230
- I didn't do.

750
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,699
I didn't do it, you 
have to believe me.

751
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:56,834
- I do.

752
00:43:58,168 --> 00:43:59,403
- You do?

753
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,804
Do you really?

754
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:06,343
- You'd have stabbed him 
once, and maybe choked him.

755
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,411
- Oh my god.

756
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:09,546
You hate me, don't you?

757
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:11,248
- No, I don't hate you.

758
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:14,518
- Jessica Ann, who's 
your next class?

759
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:16,453
- Er, first floor west wing.

760
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,455
- Then you better move along.

761
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:20,190
You're Mrs. Sterling aren't you?

762
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:21,892
You're not supposed to 
be seeing your daughter.

763
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:25,095
- I wouldn't do 
that if I were you.

764
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:36,807
- So, that's your old lady, huh?

765
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:38,642
What'd they do, let 
her out of the nuthouse

766
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:40,310
for the afternoon. 
(kids laughing)

767
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:42,312
Must be pretty cool 
having a serial mom.

768
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:45,716
- Yeah, maybe it 
runs in the family.

769
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:48,852
Maybe I'll kill 
you, in your sleep.

770
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:50,621
- Jessica Ann.

771
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:51,789
Oh wait a minute, wait a minute,

772
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,424
I just, I want to talk 
to you for a second.

773
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:58,262
Ha ha, I tell you, you really 
got in that kid's fact.

774
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:00,964
That was good.

775
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,834
They sport you today, huh?

776
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:05,302
Hey, do you want a piece of gum?

777
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:08,305
- No, my mother didn't 
get my teeth straightened

778
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,506
so I could ruin them.

779
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:12,910
- No no, don't chew gum, no 
not with braces and stuff.

780
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:15,179
(laughing) Hey listen, 
do you remember me?

781
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:17,381
- You work with 
Lieutenant March.

782
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:20,050
- Yeah well, I did 
'til he got sick.

783
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:23,187
Your mom had a hand in that one.

784
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:25,456
- I'm sorry he's sick 
but my mother had nothing

785
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:26,657
to do with it.

786
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:29,159
Excuse me I have to-- 
- no, no wait a minute,

787
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,128
wait up, now wait a minute, 
I just want to talk to you,

788
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:34,431
just want to talk to you 
for a couple of seconds.

789
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:36,934
A couple of questions here.

790
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,369
Number one have you talked 
to your mother lately?

791
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:42,372
- You mean you didn't 
see us just now?

792
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:43,807
Aren't you following 
us around hiding

793
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:45,008
behind the bushes and stuff?

794
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:50,180
- (laughing) Well, as 
a matter of fact I am.

795
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:52,783
Talked to her yesterday 
too didn't you?

796
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:55,586
- You know I did, 
at the skating rink.

797
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:58,222
Mommy and my instructor 
got in a little tiff,

798
00:45:58,288 --> 00:46:01,325
but nothing mommy 
would kill over.

799
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,995
- You sure about 
that, Jessica Ann?

800
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:08,065
- Well, I'm sure of one thing.

801
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:09,466
- You are, what's that?

802
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,902
- They ought to stick one 
of those things in your arm,

803
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:13,337
you're the nut.

804
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:19,476
(feet thumping) 
(Anderson laughing)

805
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:24,548
- Smart kid, smart kid.

806
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:28,118
(school bell ringing) 
- Thank-you for giving me

807
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:30,387
this opportunity 
to tell my side.

808
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,989
- Well, we think you've 
gotten a raw deal

809
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:35,726
in the media, and we're 
here to balance that out.

810
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:38,529
- And er, I won't have to answer

811
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:42,332
any questions from 
er, from them.

812
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:44,802
- No no, this is just a simple

813
00:46:44,868 --> 00:46:47,104
one-on-one interview with Paula.

814
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:50,040
She's on your side, 
we're all on your side.

815
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,209
- And er, no surprises.

816
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:54,978
- The only surprise 
is how it's gonna feel

817
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:56,580
to be vindicated.

818
00:46:57,848 --> 00:46:59,883
Let's go, have a seat.

819
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:03,053
- Mrs. Sterling.

820
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,188
- Hello. 
- Hello, so nice

821
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:05,389
to have you here. 
- Very nice to meet you.

822
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:06,857
- Please have a seat, please. 
- Thank-you.

823
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:09,893
(jingling music)

824
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:17,334
(audience applauding) 
- It's Paula Sands Live,

825
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:20,003
where your opinions count, 
and here's the first lady

826
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:22,606
of daytime talk, Paula Sands.

827
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:29,213
- Thanks as always Brad, 
welcome studio audience.

828
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,849
We do have a remarkable 
guest on the show today.

829
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:34,885
And I still don't know how my 
producer pulled this one off

830
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:37,187
but sitting right next 
to me is, forgive me,

831
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:39,022
the killer mommy you've 
heard so much about.

832
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:41,625
(audience mumbling) 
Mrs. Sterling, it must be

833
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,695
painful to be characterized 
by such a cruel phrase.

834
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:48,866
Tell us what it's like to 
be inside this media storm?

835
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:51,134
- Well I'm, I'm living 
a very quiet life.

836
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,604
I'm er, in a halfway house.

837
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:55,939
- You're in an 
experimental program,

838
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:57,708
some kind of new medication.

839
00:47:57,774 --> 00:47:58,675
- Yes, yes.

840
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:01,378
- I don't know if you're 
free to speak about this,

841
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:03,380
I don't know what your 
attorney has advised you.

842
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:06,783
- Oh, he advised 
me not to appear.

843
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:08,352
- But there's been 
another murder.

844
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:12,022
And we know that you are once 
again under investigation.

845
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:13,824
- That's partly why I'm here.

846
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:18,896
I am absolutely positively 
100% innocent of that crime.

847
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:20,931
(audience groaning) 
- No way!

848
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:22,833
- Get real! 
- Boo!

849
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,169
- Please, please audience, 
you can see the kind of er,

850
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,038
strong feelings 
you engender here,

851
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:29,439
and maybe you're not convincing

852
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:31,508
our studio audience 
Mrs. Sterling.

853
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:34,011
- There's really only one 
person I want to convince,

854
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:38,282
and it's a person who's 
being kept away from me.

855
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,751
It's my daughter.

856
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:43,153
- Well, I know that our 
audience is just dying

857
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,388
to ask some questions of you,

858
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:46,123
so Brad, you have 
our first question

859
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:47,324
from the studio audience.

860
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:50,627
- You say you want your 
daughter's attention.

861
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:54,598
Is that why maybe you 
tried to strangle her?

862
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:56,500
- I was told there 
wouldn't be any questions

863
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:57,701
from the audience. 
- Oh Mrs. Sterling,

864
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,269
I don't know where you 
got that impression

865
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:01,471
but if you watch this 
show, this is our format.

866
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:02,773
- No, but I'm-- 
- Brad another question

867
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:04,174
from the audience. 
- Not comfortable with this.

868
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:05,542
- Now, you say you 
love your daughter.

869
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:06,710
Well girlfriend, you better 
get your stuff together

870
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,712
before you start laying 
your own personal trip

871
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,281
on her head, you hear what 
I'm saying, girlfriend.

872
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:14,151
- I would never 
hurt my daughter.

873
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:18,322
I, I love my daughter, 
more than life itself.

874
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:20,157
- People like you 
don't deserve to live.

875
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:22,893
Lethal injection is 
too damn good for you.

876
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,462
They ought to hang 
your snooty ass.

877
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:27,331
- Er that really 
isn't a question.

878
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:29,132
Mrs. Sterling, you can 
see the strong feelings

879
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,201
that you bring up 
in our audience.

880
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:34,972
- I was promised that there 
would not be any questions

881
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:35,906
from the audience. 
- Let's bring out

882
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,240
our second guest for today.

883
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,176
In fact, you've seen her 
before on this program.

884
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:41,478
She has her own strong 
feelings about this subject.

885
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:43,947
Jolene Jones, the sister of one

886
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:45,782
of Mrs. Sterling's 
alleged victims.

887
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:47,751
- [Mrs. Sterling] I will 
not be part of this.

888
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,587
- Hey, don't you try to crawl 
away, you murdering (beeping)

889
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:51,922
You are gonna sit 
here and face the

890
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,724
(beeping) music this time.

891
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:56,193
Ah, come on, look at me, 
huh, what are you, afraid?

892
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:57,761
Look at me.

893
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,162
You killed my sister.

894
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:00,464
Some day you are 
gonna pay for it.

895
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:01,898
You are gonna (beeping) pay.

896
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:04,234
- We'll be right back after 
this word from our sponsor.

897
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:06,536
Happy Family Dairy.

898
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:07,571
Jerry.

899
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:09,306
- Yes Paula. 
- Jerry, did Mrs. Sterling

900
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:10,507
know that she was going to take

901
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:11,808
those questions 
from the audience,

902
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:13,610
and that she was appearing 
with Miss. Jones?

903
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,712
- Our guests don't get 
to dictate the terms

904
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:16,680
of their appearance, Paula.

905
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:18,515
- Yes, I know but-- 
- You are a liar,

906
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:19,683
and a heal. 
- Well, you are a

907
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,451
murdering bitch. 
- Stay away from me.

908
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,120
- Ah what, are you 
gonna fry me too.

909
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:25,088
- It shut your sister up.

910
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:27,124
- Listen to me you 
psycho bitch, ow, god!

911
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,925
- Yeah, how would ladies 
feel about repeating

912
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:30,027
this one on camera?

913
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:32,829
- You're lucky I'm mellowed out.

914
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,900
- Stand by. 
- On in three.

915
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:39,469
(chattering)

916
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:43,306
- Welcome back, and a reminder

917
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:44,975
that on tomorrow's 
show born again,

918
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,477
full-bodied tattooed bikers.

919
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:55,719
- You need me Jerry?

920
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:58,855
- Yeah, can you see if 
Phil's got that memo ready.

921
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:00,057
Rating book came in today.

922
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:01,458
- You got it. 
- Oh, and while

923
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:04,728
you're at it, can you get 
rid of some of this garbage.

924
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:08,465
Film, noir theater, 
who's idea was this?

925
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:20,043
(heels clanking)

926
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:23,113
- What was the 
idea today, Jerry?

927
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:25,248
- Ratings.

928
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:27,684
I just sent Chris 
after the latest.

929
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:28,685
You'll see.

930
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:29,953
- I thought we had 
an understanding,

931
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,988
no more ambushing the guests.

932
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:33,223
- That woman is not a guest.

933
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,591
She is an ambush.

934
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:36,760
- You got her on the show 
under false pretenses.

935
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:38,728
Nevermind the right 
or wrong of that.

936
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:41,998
Word gets out I can't be 
trusted, we're finished.

937
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:43,200
- Yeah? 
- Yeah.

938
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,401
- Yeah?

939
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:46,837
You want to wait for 
the ratings memo?

940
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:48,638
- You are a heal Jerry.

941
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:53,743
Which must come in handy the 
way you walk all over people.

942
00:51:58,248 --> 00:52:00,250
I'll be in my office.

943
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:13,330
(heels clanking) 
(pensive music)

944
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:16,266

946
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:38,221

Oh.

Oh.

00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:16,359
Hmm.

00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:39,189
- I think that if you decided 
to kill this sleazeball,

1009
00:57:42,158 --> 00:57:44,494
you erm, wouldn't 
have tipped your hand

1010
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:46,062
in front of a studio audience,

1011
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,898
and you wouldn't have 
gouged his eyes out

1012
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:51,568
with that spiked heel either.

1013
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:52,669
Too messy.

1014
00:57:53,603 --> 00:57:56,339
- If I were the 
person you think I am.

1015
00:57:56,406 --> 00:57:57,807
And of course I'm not.

1016
00:57:57,874 --> 00:57:59,709
I'm completely innocent.

1017
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:03,179
Never have and never would 
intentionally kill anyone.

1018
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:04,113
- Never?

1019
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,051
- I'd have made it 
look like an accident.

1020
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:11,855
I'd have made sure the falling 
light put his lights out.

1021
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:15,124
If I were the person 
you think I am.

1022
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:20,196
- Well, you, me and 
your head doctor know

1023
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:27,904
that this M.O. is 
all wrong for you.

1024
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:29,138
But it doesn't mean 
that you're not gonna

1025
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:31,140
wind up taking the fall.

1026
00:58:31,207 --> 00:58:33,109
- But I, I didn't 
do these murders.

1027
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,277
(pensive music)

1028
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:38,748
- No no no no no, you never 
killed anybody remember.

You're just a 
poor, innocent mom.

00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:47,724
Though somebody is trying to 
put in a very very fancy frame.

1031
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:55,265
(radio crackling) 
(keyboard clanking)

1032
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:57,901
- [Jolene] Thank-you 
Mrs. Conway.

1033
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:00,303
You have a lovely home.

1034
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,337
- Thank-you.

1035
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:07,710
Let me know if 
you need anything.

1036
00:59:07,777 --> 00:59:09,379
- [Paul] Please, sit 
down, Miss. Jones.

1037
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:11,447
- Oh no, don't be so formal.

1038
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:12,916
Call me Jolene hmm.

1039
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:14,651
Listen, do you mind if I smoke?

1040
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:15,919
- Actually yes.

1041
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:20,156
My wife doesn't allow 
smoking in this house.

1042
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,524
- Well, I would've 
thought maybe you were

1043
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:23,192
in charge around here.

1044
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:24,727
I mean it was your 
mommy book that paid

1045
00:59:24,794 --> 00:59:26,329
for all this, hmm.

1046
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:30,833
- Miss Jones, er Jolene, 
I'm on a deadline.

1047
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,570
Out of curtesy to your 
and your late sister--

1048
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:36,239
- Oh oh, my late 
sister was trash.

1049
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:38,942
I mean I think she was 
a les or something.

1050
00:59:39,008 --> 00:59:43,046
Now me, well I have more 
conventional tastes.

1051
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:48,518
- Hmm, please, lets 
get to the point.

1052
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:52,255
- Well the point is, reality 
don't count for nothing.

1053
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:53,923
Appearance is all.

1054
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:56,693
You know, doesn't matter if me

1055
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,428
and my late sister ain't 
spoke since high school.

1056
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:01,097
- Well why don't you 
tell me what does matter.

1057
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:04,000
(phone clicking)

1058
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:08,905
- Come on mommy, please.

1059
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:13,676
Mommy, mommy, I just 
saw that terrible woman.

1060
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:20,249
- Yes, she could be the 
one doing this to mommy.

1061
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:26,189
Dear, it means so much to 
me you calling me like this.

1062
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:29,926
Bye sweetheart.

1063
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:35,131
(phone clattering)

1064
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:38,167
- [Jolene] I'm an 
author too, you know.

1065
01:00:38,234 --> 01:00:39,869
- [Paul] Really?

1066
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:41,504
- I wasn't lying 
about your publisher.

1067
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:43,272
Him and five others.

1068
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:46,743
They all want me.

1069
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,145
- For what?

1070
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:51,214
- Well, as soon as they nail 
your loony sister-in-law

1071
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,149
for these new murders, 
there's going to be room

1072
01:00:53,216 --> 01:00:55,718
for a new mommy book 
on the bestseller list.

1073
01:00:55,785 --> 01:00:58,755
- And you're going to write it?

1074
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,858
- Why don't we 
write it, together?

1075
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,228
- Ooh, I get it.

1076
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:10,700
With your charisma, 
the talk show circuit,

1077
01:01:11,634 --> 01:01:14,404
my name next to 
yours on the cover.

1078
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:16,305
- Sequel to a bestseller.

1079
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:20,476
You know, I bet we'd work 
really well together.

1080
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:24,914
- You know, I just 
thought of something.

1081
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:27,350
- What's that?

1082
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:31,754
- My wife doesn't allow 
animals in this house either.

1083
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:33,156
You better go.

1084
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:44,834
- I don't need you to do this.

1085
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:49,305
This was just 
professional curtesy.

1086
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:55,478
(radio squawking)

1087
01:01:57,413 --> 01:02:00,650
Listen, do we really 
need that jerk?

1088
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,919
Good, I didn't think so.

1089
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:05,955
A ghostwriter?

1090
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:09,325
What do you mean, 
like Stephen King?

1091
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:13,262
Oh, oh, all I do is 
talk into a tape, okay.

1092
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:20,236
How much do we have to pay?

1093
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:22,972
Really?

1094
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:26,642
Huh, no I hadn't 
thought of that.

1095
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:29,278
You know, I guess 
Conway would've taken 
a pretty big bite.

1096
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:31,581
You know, and that 
bestseller and all.

1097
01:02:31,647 --> 01:02:33,850
Ah, so we're better off.

1098
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:37,086
Well all right, 
when do we start?

1099
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:39,489
Ah, baby I was born ready.

1100
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:44,093
Okay, okay, bye-bye.

1101
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:51,334
Ah, who needs you, 
you stuck up jerk.

1102
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:56,806
"My wife don't allow no 
smoking in the house."

1103
01:02:56,873 --> 01:03:00,243
Yeah, I bet that 
ain't the only thing.

1104
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:04,547
Money money money money 
money money money money money

1105
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:07,650
money money money money 
money money money money money

1106
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:12,121
money money money money 
money money money money.

1107
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:26,836
(rings scraping)

1108
01:03:26,903 --> 01:03:29,839
(water gushing)

1109
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,082
(tense music)

1110
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:04,440
(pensive music)

1111
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:15,151
(suspenseful music)

1112
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:27,463
(lively cassette music) 
(sparks zapping)

1113
01:04:42,478 --> 01:04:45,214
(water gushing)

1114
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:09,672
(light music)

1115
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:17,647
- [Mrs. Sterling] Jessica 
Ann, wake up dear, wake up.

1116
01:05:19,115 --> 01:05:20,182
- Mommy?

1117
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:23,486
- I'm, I'm leaving.

1118
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:24,420
- Leaving?

1119
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:31,193
- We both know that somebody's 
making this look like mommy.

1120
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:37,133
So I erm, I have some money 
hidden under a new name,

1121
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:41,270
and I'm gonna leave the country.

1122
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:43,606
- Will I ever see you?

1123
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:46,108
- No no no, I want 
you to come with me.

1124
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:47,310
- Oh mommy.

1125
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:52,181
- Please, Jessica Ann, 
we can start over.

1126
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:55,017
Clean, fresh, a second chance.

1127
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,755
- Mommy. 
(switch clicking)

1128
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:01,390
(Jessica gasping) 
- I want you out of here.

1129
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:04,226
Now. 
- But Beth, she's my baby.

1130
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:06,996
- Do you want me to 
call the police myself?

1131
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:08,931
- Beth, Beth, I don't 
think you better.

1132
01:06:08,998 --> 01:06:11,467
Ladies, let's talk, come on.

1133
01:06:18,774 --> 01:06:20,409
With all that's been going 
on, I've been listening

1134
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:23,045
to the police 
scanner in my office.

1135
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:25,181
- What's happened now?

1136
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:29,285
- Jolene Jones 
has been murdered.

1137
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:31,454
- It's my fault, I 
shouldn't have called you.

1138
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,655
I'm so sorry.

1139
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:35,391
- Oh no, no, baby, 
I didn't do this.

1140
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:37,293
You, you've got to believe me.

1141
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,895
- There's a warrant 
out for your arrest.

1142
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:41,964
- What happened?

1143
01:06:42,031 --> 01:06:45,001
- [Paul] She was electrocuted.

1144
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:47,403
- Oh, no I didn't do this.

1145
01:06:48,437 --> 01:06:51,007
I swear to god, 
I didn't do this.

1146
01:06:51,073 --> 01:06:53,075
I haven't been 
committing these murders.

1147
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:54,543
I'm innocent.

1148
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:58,147
Please, please you 
have to believe me.

1149
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:01,550
- Well, I think it's time 
we talked to your attorney.

1150
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:03,753
(phone clicking) 
You remember his home

1151
01:07:03,819 --> 01:07:05,821
telephone number? 
- Yeah.

1152
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:09,792
(phone beeping)

1153
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:15,865
(phone ringing) 
Ah,

1154
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:17,066
oh. 
- This is Neal Ekhardt.

1155
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:18,167
- It's his machine. 
- I'm out of town,

1156
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:19,301
but I will be 
checking my messages.

1157
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:21,303
(machine beeping) 
- Should I er,

1158
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:22,972
should I leave a message?

1159
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,508
Can I have him call me here?

1160
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:33,682
Ah Neal, this, you 
know who this is.

1161
01:07:35,317 --> 01:07:38,454
I'm, I'm, it's 
urgent that we talk.

1162
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:42,825
I'm at my sister's.

1163
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:47,463
Okay. 
(phone beeping)

1164
01:07:48,764 --> 01:07:51,834
(puffing) Thank-you.

1165
01:07:54,703 --> 01:08:00,176
Can I erm, can I use the 
spare bedroom? (sobbing)

1166
01:08:15,991 --> 01:08:18,727
(ominous music)

1167
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:31,574
(dramatic music)

1168
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:48,324
(door thumping) 
(engine revving)

1169
01:09:18,854 --> 01:09:21,590
(pensive music)

1170
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:32,868
(dramatic music)

1171
01:09:35,971 --> 01:09:37,573
- What? 
- They're gone.

1172
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:38,507
- Gone?

1173
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:47,049
- No no, no I don't think the 
girl's in any danger at all.

1174
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:51,520
No, listen Mrs. Conway, 
shh, listen, shh please.

1175
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:54,623
Now we both know she 
loves this little girl.

1176
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:57,193
She's not going to 
do anything to her.

1177
01:09:57,259 --> 01:10:00,129
I'm gonna put an APB 
out on both of them.

1178
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:01,263
Yeah, I.

1179
01:10:03,265 --> 01:10:04,767
I know, I know that!

1180
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:07,002
Last time she tried to 
leave the country, I know.

1181
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:09,605
No look please, listen to me.

1182
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:12,174
I need you to do 
something for me.

1183
01:10:12,241 --> 01:10:14,443
Are you listening? 
- Yes.

1184
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:15,978
Yes.

1185
01:10:17,012 --> 01:10:17,880
A photo.

1186
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:22,017
Yes sergeant, I'll 
be right down.

1187
01:10:22,084 --> 01:10:25,221
He needs a photo of 
Jessica Ann to distribute.

1188
01:10:25,287 --> 01:10:27,389
He already has one of my sister.

1189
01:10:27,456 --> 01:10:30,826
- Hmm, here, you go, 
I'll watch the phone.

1190
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:31,760
Bye honey.

1191
01:10:34,196 --> 01:10:36,832
(Paul sighing)

1192
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:49,411
(cup clinking)

1193
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:54,583
(Paul sighing)

1194
01:10:55,384 --> 01:10:57,353
(phone ringing)

1195
01:10:57,419 --> 01:11:00,055
(keys jingling)

1196
01:11:00,122 --> 01:11:02,691
(door clattering)

1197
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:03,626
- I know.

1198
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:08,497
- [Woman] I've got the brat.

1199
01:11:10,232 --> 01:11:12,468
- You know what 
you've got to do.

1200
01:11:12,534 --> 01:11:14,870
- I want more. 
- More what?

1201
01:11:16,338 --> 01:11:18,107
- [Woman] More, 
what do you think.

1202
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:19,375
Money dick weed.

1203
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:22,211
You want the kid dead, 
I want a percentage.

1204
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:23,879
- A percentage.

1205
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:25,247
- You're gonna make 
a bundle off of

1206
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:26,782
this little sequel you got.

1207
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:28,884
I'm the one doing stunt work.

1208
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:31,687
I want it in writing, 
a piece of the book,

1209
01:11:31,754 --> 01:11:35,758
the movie, who knows, 
maybe they'll do a CD-ROM,

1210
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:38,727
mommy chasing baby around 
with a butcher knife.

1211
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:41,730
- You want a murder 
contract in writing?

1212
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:44,967
Are you completely 
out of your mind?

1213
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:48,203
- I'm a consulted, I 
want it in writing,

1214
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:49,838
and I want it now.

1215
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,609
- Where are you?

1216
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:57,146
- Where we made the first 
money drop, remember.

1217
01:11:57,212 --> 01:11:59,148
Won't take you half an hour.

1218
01:11:59,214 --> 01:12:01,383
At least it better not.

1219
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:04,453
(phone clanking)

1220
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:08,490
(phone clicking)

1221
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:13,429
(phone clanking)

1222
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:18,500
(dramatic music)

1223
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:31,447
(drawer handles clattering)

1224
01:12:51,266 --> 01:12:53,902
(gun clicking)

1225
01:12:59,241 --> 01:13:02,144
(chain clattering)

1226
01:13:11,286 --> 01:13:12,154
- Oh.

1227
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:20,095
(tense music)

1228
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:34,643
- What are you doing here?

1229
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:35,778
Beth's out looking for you.

1230
01:13:35,844 --> 01:13:38,213
We thought you took Jessica Ann.

1231
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,382
The police are looking for you.

1232
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:42,451
- I heard you on the phone.

1233
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:44,853
I know you've been framing me.

1234
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:49,792
I'd have known a lot sooner 
if it hadn't been for this.

1235
01:13:52,861 --> 01:13:54,530
- You don't understand.

1236
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:57,299
I'm involved in a 
sting operation.

1237
01:13:57,366 --> 01:13:58,834
Let me explain.

1238
01:13:58,901 --> 01:14:01,904
- Oh, I wish I had 
time to listen.

1239
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:04,807
You really are an 
imaginative writer.

1240
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:07,709
But I have to help my daughter.

1241
01:14:11,013 --> 01:14:13,582
- Oh, this isn't the 
ending I had in mind.

1242
01:14:13,649 --> 01:14:14,416
(ominous music)

1243
01:14:14,483 --> 01:14:16,051
But it'll work.

1244
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:19,655
- You know you may find it 
harder to actually kill someone,

1245
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:23,725
than to just write about 
it or hire a killer.

1246
01:14:24,893 --> 01:14:29,498
It takes a special kind 
of person to take a life.

1247
01:14:29,565 --> 01:14:32,201
(grunting) 
(gasping)

1248
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:36,872
Don't you know the sequel is 
never as good as the original.

1249
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:38,006
(crashing) 
(computer sparking)

1250
01:14:38,073 --> 01:14:42,978
(electricity zapping) 
(glass exploding)

1251
01:15:12,774 --> 01:15:15,711
(pensive music)

1252
01:15:47,309 --> 01:15:49,912
(tense music)

1253
01:16:06,762 --> 01:16:09,698
(ominous music)

1254
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:16,772
(exciting music)

1255
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:29,651
(water rushing)

1256
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:05,914
- Ah!

1257
01:18:07,582 --> 01:18:09,351
- Thanks for running.

1258
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:14,022
I wondered if killing a kid 
would kind of get to me.

1259
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:17,225
But you causing me this 
much trouble helps.

1260
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:19,261
Your uncle said I 
should strangle you,

1261
01:18:19,327 --> 01:18:22,431
to make it look more 
like your mommy did it.

1262
01:18:22,497 --> 01:18:24,399
It's just not my style.

1263
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:26,835
- Oh please. 
- Why don't you pick

1264
01:18:26,902 --> 01:18:28,570
on somebody your own size.

1265
01:18:28,637 --> 01:18:32,441
- Help, mommy! 
(feet thumping)

1266
01:18:32,507 --> 01:18:33,275
Ow.

1267
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:35,944
(tense music)

1268
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:50,759
- You know, imitation is the 
sincerest form of plagiarism.

1269
01:18:54,096 --> 01:18:55,363
- I'm walking out of here.

1270
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:57,666
You keep your distance, maybe 
the kid keeps breathing.

1271
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:59,868
- You let her go 
and I'll you go.

1272
01:18:59,935 --> 01:19:01,470
I have nothing against you.

1273
01:19:01,536 --> 01:19:03,338
- Nothing against me.

1274
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:04,306
- Mommy!

1275
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:07,509
- I know you're just 
a working whore.

1276
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:10,112
By the way, you're out of a job.

1277
01:19:10,178 --> 01:19:14,082
I'm afraid I just 
punched your meal ticket.

1278
01:19:24,826 --> 01:19:27,062
(dramatic music) 
- Agh!

1279
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:30,332
(suspenseful music)

1280
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:37,672
(gun firing) 
(grunting)

1281
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:41,109
(knife whipping) 
- Ow.

1282
01:19:41,176 --> 01:19:42,878
- Mommy. 
(gun firing)

1283
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:46,081
(wood splintering)

1284
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:51,386
(water gushing)

1285
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:02,430
(dramatic music)

1286
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:09,938
- Oh.

1287
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:14,142
(somber music)

1288
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:30,025
(Jessica sniffling)

1289
01:20:30,959 --> 01:20:33,295
- Who is your best friend?

1290
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:36,498
- You are.

1291
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:43,338
- Who loves you more than 
anything on god's green earth?

1292
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:44,439
- You do.

1293
01:20:49,711 --> 01:20:53,148
(Mrs. Sterling sighing)

1294
01:20:59,487 --> 01:21:02,290
(sirens wailing)

1295
01:21:08,463 --> 01:21:12,133
- [Anderson] Yeah, her 
name was Glenna Cole.

1296
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:15,403
Conway interviewed her for 
his contract killer book.

1297
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:19,007
- That's nice. 
- (laughing) Nice?

1298
01:21:19,074 --> 01:21:20,709
- Well, I'm happy 
for your sergeant,

1299
01:21:20,775 --> 01:21:22,177
tying up these loose ends.

1300
01:21:22,244 --> 01:21:23,511
- How's your sister doing?

1301
01:21:23,578 --> 01:21:27,115
- Hmm, she's home, 
but under sedation.

1302
01:21:27,849 --> 01:21:29,584
Such an awful shock.

1303
01:21:30,518 --> 01:21:32,821
I'm going to be 
moving in shortly.

1304
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:33,955
And she thinks she's well enough

1305
01:21:34,022 --> 01:21:36,958
to attend Jessica Ann's 
staking competition.

1306
01:21:37,025 --> 01:21:38,793
- Is your new implant in place?

1307
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:39,928
- Yes.

1308
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:43,632
No need to worry.

1309
01:21:44,866 --> 01:21:47,769
- I guess I owe you an apology.

1310
01:21:47,836 --> 01:21:49,404
Huh, but I should 
tell you though,

1311
01:21:49,471 --> 01:21:53,742
that even your doctor 
admitted something to me.

1312
01:21:53,808 --> 01:21:56,011
- Really? 
- Oh yeah.

1313
01:21:56,077 --> 01:21:58,013
That last killing.

1314
01:21:58,079 --> 01:21:59,314
Jolene Jones.

1315
01:22:00,482 --> 01:22:03,451
That one really 
did fit your M.O.

1316
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,388
- But now, I thought 
you had cleared

1317
01:22:06,454 --> 01:22:08,857
all those murders off the books?

1318
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:10,558
- Yeah we did.

1319
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:13,561
So I guess only Jolene 
Jones herself can

1320
01:22:13,628 --> 01:22:15,697
identify her killer huh?

1321
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:18,466
- It's a pity you can't ask her.

1322
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:25,407
(spectators applauding)

1323
01:22:54,669 --> 01:22:56,905
I was afraid they were 
gonna give first place

1324
01:22:56,972 --> 01:23:01,943
to that little Asian girl, 
just to be politically correct.

1325
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:05,413
They're lucky they 
did the right thing.

1326
01:23:14,155 --> 01:23:17,025
(upbeat music)

1327
01:23:18,259 --> 01:23:22,664
