[heavy breathing]

8
00:01:54,307 --> 00:01:56,142
Rodrigo!

9
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:59,879
We have a cease fire!

10
00:01:59,946 --> 00:02:02,714
Why did you kill my officers?

11
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:07,887
[speaking Portuguese]

12
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:29,175
Rodrigo.

13
00:02:30,242 --> 00:02:31,810
Rodrigo, drop your weapon!

14
00:02:31,877 --> 00:02:33,511
Down on your knees!

15
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,915
Down on your knees!

16
00:02:39,218 --> 00:02:41,220
[speaking Portuguese]

17
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,102

[thunder]

20
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:25,865
[speaking Portuguese]

21
00:03:50,523 --> 00:03:53,492
Major, the rebels don't have
air support large enough

22
00:03:53,558 --> 00:03:55,560
to level an area this size.

23
00:03:58,297 --> 00:04:00,933
There's no smell of conventional
ordnance, no smell of petroleum.

24
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,934
They must have access
to something

25
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:03,469
we're not aware of yet.

26
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:05,004
Then, respectfully, sir,
why don't we eliminate them

27
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:06,638
before they destroy
a vital target?

28
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:07,873
This is an international
peacekeeping mission,

29
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,442
not a sanctioned war.

30
00:04:09,508 --> 00:04:11,210
The only reason your unit's
even here is to assist

31
00:04:11,277 --> 00:04:13,546
in the identification of these
unexplained demolitions.

32
00:04:13,611 --> 00:04:14,880
And, so far,
you've done a pretty

33
00:04:14,947 --> 00:04:16,182
piss poor job of it, Lieutenant.

34
00:04:16,248 --> 00:04:18,084
[rumbling]

35
00:04:21,153 --> 00:04:23,122
Since when does Brazil
get earthquakes?

36
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:24,190
I don't know, sir.

37
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:28,527
Could these tremors
be tied to something

38
00:04:28,593 --> 00:04:30,362
that's causing
this devastation?

39
00:04:30,429 --> 00:04:33,399
Some kind of induced seismicity?

40
00:04:33,466 --> 00:04:35,334
You mean like fracking, sir?

41
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:37,069
Yeah, possibly that.

42
00:04:37,136 --> 00:04:39,171
But what would be
the cause of this?

43
00:04:42,108 --> 00:04:44,043
That's what we're here
to find out for you, sir.

44
00:04:47,546 --> 00:04:49,949
Zeus, Scavenger.
Come in, Zeus.

45
00:04:50,015 --> 00:04:52,617
We read you, Scavenger.
The general is inbound.

46
00:04:52,684 --> 00:04:55,653
[alarm sounds]

47
00:05:05,564 --> 00:05:07,166
General Norris.

48
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:09,767
I have Scavenger
on the line, ma'am.

49
00:05:09,835 --> 00:05:11,904
What's your SITREP?

50
00:05:11,971 --> 00:05:13,705
We've yet to identify
a signature, ma'am.

51
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,407
Seismic weaponry may
be a possibility

52
00:05:15,474 --> 00:05:17,076
regarding the tremors.

53
00:05:17,143 --> 00:05:19,677
But still doesn't account
for the source of demolitions.

54
00:05:19,744 --> 00:05:21,746
Rule out any type
of seismic weaponry.

55
00:05:21,813 --> 00:05:24,316
We're receiving reports
of global vulnerabilities

56
00:05:24,383 --> 00:05:26,318
in kind, not just in Brazil.

57
00:05:26,385 --> 00:05:27,853
Did you say global, ma'am?

58
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,421
- Is this a coordinated attack?
- [alarm sounds]

59
00:05:29,488 --> 00:05:32,124
Hold on, Scavenger.
Would you turn that thing off?

60
00:05:32,191 --> 00:05:33,559
Yes, General.

61
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:36,661
Scavenger, we are not dealing
with weaponized systems.

62
00:05:36,728 --> 00:05:38,230
I don't understand, ma'am.

63
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:40,099
We're seeing a variety
of natural disasters

64
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:41,133
around the globe.

65
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,436
Earthquakes,
fires, floods,

66
00:05:44,503 --> 00:05:46,372
tornados, tsunamis,

67
00:05:46,438 --> 00:05:49,408
even locust swarms.

68
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:51,177
Locust swarms, General?

69
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:56,382
Affirmative.

70
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:57,983
You've been around the world.

71
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,553
You've seen a few battlefields
in your day, as have I.

72
00:06:00,619 --> 00:06:02,354
Now you tell me.

73
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:03,889
What does this look like to you?

74
00:06:05,257 --> 00:06:07,426
Sounds like something out
of the book of Revelations,

75
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:10,029
the end of the world, ma'am.

76
00:06:10,095 --> 00:06:11,997
The frequency and severity
of these disasters

77
00:06:12,064 --> 00:06:14,633
are increasing and
Cal-Tech has determined

78
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,068
that they're originating
from a location

79
00:06:16,135 --> 00:06:19,605
near you at an
exponential rate.

80
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:21,106
Say again, ma'am?

81
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:24,577
These vulnerabilities
are occurring near you.

82
00:06:24,643 --> 00:06:26,078
Copy that, ma'am.

83
00:06:26,145 --> 00:06:29,315
You mention "geothermal"
as in volcanic?

84
00:06:29,381 --> 00:06:30,616
Affirmative.

85
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:32,284
Now I need you to listen to me.

86
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,486
Our priorities in Brazil have
changed effective immediately.

87
00:06:34,553 --> 00:06:36,088
Yes, ma'am.

88
00:06:36,155 --> 00:06:37,923
I'm assembling a team
of scientists who are experts

89
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,694
in the field of volcanology,
meteorology and mycology.

90
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,562
I'm dispatching them
to your location.

91
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:44,897
And they will do everything
that they can within their power

92
00:06:44,964 --> 00:06:46,532
to stop this thing.

93
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:51,570
As of now, your new assignment
is to provide a security detail

94
00:06:51,637 --> 00:06:54,640
and assist the scientists in any
way that they deem necessary.

95
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:55,908
Is that understood?

96
00:06:55,975 --> 00:06:57,476
Affirmative, ma'am.

97
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,945
Expect the arrival of these
scientists within hours.

98
00:07:00,012 --> 00:07:02,747
As of right now, we have
a 12-hour window

99
00:07:02,814 --> 00:07:04,183
before the eruption
that will end

100
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,185
life on this planet
as we know it.

101
00:07:06,252 --> 00:07:08,786
And that timeframe is subject

102
00:07:08,854 --> 00:07:10,322
to change pending intel.

103
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:11,457
Copy, Zeus.

104
00:07:11,523 --> 00:07:13,726
New orders received
and understood.

105
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:16,462
Scavenger out.

106
00:07:21,934 --> 00:07:23,402
What do you got for me, Aidan?

107
00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:25,803
Okay, these are our top
candidates all within

108
00:07:25,871 --> 00:07:27,072
hour's travel time
to Brazil, General.

109
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:28,307
Hm.

110
00:07:32,945 --> 00:07:34,480
Lynise Hughes.

111
00:07:34,546 --> 00:07:36,081
This is Colonel Nathan Hughes's
daughter, isn't it?

112
00:07:36,148 --> 00:07:37,850
Yes, it is, General.

113
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,485
Actually, it's why
I pulled her file.

114
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:41,487
Not only has she worked
directly with the military,

115
00:07:41,553 --> 00:07:44,290
she's also one of the
best I her field.

116
00:07:44,356 --> 00:07:46,992
- Outstanding.
- I try my best, ma'am.

117
00:08:04,576 --> 00:08:05,978
[phone ringing]

118
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:08,480
This is Lynise Hughes.

119
00:08:08,547 --> 00:08:11,216
Dr. Lynise Hughes, this
is General Brigitte Norris

120
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:13,852
calling you from the United
States Army on a secured line.

121
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,354
I'm a colleague of
your father's.

122
00:08:15,421 --> 00:08:17,890
Hello, General Norris.
I can't talk right now.

123
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,091
I'm in the middle
of something important.

124
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:20,459
I'm outside of Mexico City.

125
00:08:20,526 --> 00:08:22,027
We're experience
volcanic activity here

126
00:08:22,094 --> 00:08:23,796
like I've never seen before.

127
00:08:23,862 --> 00:08:27,399
It's happening everywhere,
doctor, all across the globe.

128
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:30,736
Every continent is experiencing
violent volcanoes,

129
00:08:30,803 --> 00:08:33,038
earthquakes and storms.

130
00:08:33,105 --> 00:08:34,440
Now we think that
we've pinpointed

131
00:08:34,506 --> 00:08:36,842
the epicenter of
these activities in Brazil.

132
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,277
Wait. Brazil?

133
00:08:38,344 --> 00:08:40,646
But there shouldn't be
any volcanoes in Brazil.

134
00:08:40,713 --> 00:08:42,981
They're dormant.
They've been extinct forever.

135
00:08:43,048 --> 00:08:45,184
Not any more, doctor.

136
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,753
I want you on the ground.

137
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,021
I need your expertise.

138
00:08:49,088 --> 00:08:51,557
I want you to confirm it
is indeed Brazil

139
00:08:51,623 --> 00:08:53,525
as the source
of these disturbances,

140
00:08:53,592 --> 00:08:57,029
if we can stop it,
and how we can stop it.

141
00:08:57,096 --> 00:08:58,597
This is causing
a chain reaction

142
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:00,834
of catastrophic
destruction around the world.

143
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:02,668
Okay, okay.

144
00:09:02,735 --> 00:09:04,970
I'll need a minute to get down.
I'm on top of a mountain.

145
00:09:07,706 --> 00:09:10,242
A helicopter is
already enroute to you.

146
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:12,311
They'll initiate contact
with you on this frequency

147
00:09:12,378 --> 00:09:14,279
and instruct you where
to be for extraction.

148
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,348
I'll also have a full,
up to date report

149
00:09:16,415 --> 00:09:18,350
for you to review
on your travels.

150
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:21,220
Okay, General, I'll be waiting.
Out.

151
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:32,231
Meteorologist
Dakota Lenna, ma'am.

152
00:09:32,297 --> 00:09:33,899
Magna Cum Laude from M.I.T.

153
00:09:33,966 --> 00:09:36,668
She's currently assigned to
INM working on cloud seeding

154
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:38,437
and weather patterns
in areas

155
00:09:38,504 --> 00:09:40,773
suffering from
wildfire devastation.

156
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,341
Top of her game, General.

157
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,626
Dakota! Dakota!

158
00:10:00,692 --> 00:10:01,627
- What?
- The Army!

159
00:10:01,693 --> 00:10:02,829
- What?
- The Army!

160
00:10:02,896 --> 00:10:04,129
They want to talk
to you right now!

161
00:10:04,196 --> 00:10:05,297
- The Army?
- Get back in the truck.

162
00:10:05,364 --> 00:10:07,699
It sounds important.
Come on.

163
00:10:07,766 --> 00:10:09,701
Why's the Army on the phone?

164
00:10:13,505 --> 00:10:16,876
Elliott Rodney, two PhDs,
one in mycology,

165
00:10:16,942 --> 00:10:18,310
the other in ecology.

166
00:10:18,377 --> 00:10:20,212
The reason I pulled his file
is he's worked

167
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,681
with the DOD before
involving mycotoxins.

168
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:25,484
Sounds good.
Call him up.

169
00:10:25,551 --> 00:10:26,985
Yes, ma'am.

170
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:36,495
[beeping]

171
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,974
[rumbling]

172
00:10:57,884 --> 00:10:59,518
[phone ringing]

173
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:26,478
Dr. Hughes,
I'm Major Oakley Jones.

174
00:11:26,545 --> 00:11:29,916
This is Sergeant Shockley
and Lieutenant Rohrbacher.

175
00:11:29,983 --> 00:11:30,950
I'm glad you arrived safely.

176
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:32,184
Thank you, Major.

177
00:11:32,251 --> 00:11:34,019
- Are you a man of faith?
- I am.

178
00:11:34,086 --> 00:11:35,654
Good, 'cause
we're gonna need it.

179
00:11:35,721 --> 00:11:38,056
We're expecting two more
scientists within the hour.

180
00:11:38,123 --> 00:11:39,458
So please come with me.

181
00:12:56,668 --> 00:12:58,337
Major, I meant
to ask you,

182
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,739
I saw a lot of the country
burning on my flight in.

183
00:13:00,806 --> 00:13:01,908
Are they wildfires?

184
00:13:01,975 --> 00:13:04,242
Yes, ma'am.
Wildfires too.

185
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:05,377
And I read in the report
that we're

186
00:13:05,444 --> 00:13:06,778
in the middle of a civil war?

187
00:13:06,846 --> 00:13:08,380
More of an uprising.

188
00:13:08,447 --> 00:13:10,515
Oh, so that's
the original mission

189
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,417
that brought you down here,
fighting the rebels?

190
00:13:12,484 --> 00:13:15,487
Government tactical
assistance and guidance.

191
00:13:15,554 --> 00:13:16,990
But things have
changed drastically

192
00:13:17,056 --> 00:13:19,224
in the last 24 hours,
straining those efforts

193
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,027
and altering our priorities.

194
00:13:21,094 --> 00:13:22,260
Clearly.

195
00:13:22,327 --> 00:13:23,562
Did you have a
chance to examine

196
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:25,597
General Norris's file
on the way over?

197
00:13:25,664 --> 00:13:26,698
I did.

198
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,600
Assuming all of these
global disasters

199
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:31,070
can be traced to our current
events here in Brazil,

200
00:13:31,136 --> 00:13:35,641
what comes next is an eruption
that is orders of magnitude

201
00:13:35,707 --> 00:13:39,012
more powerful than anything
we've ever seen before.

202
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:40,947
To break it down Barney style,

203
00:13:41,014 --> 00:13:44,483
molten fire will rain
down on every continent.

204
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:46,351
It'll be followed
by a nuclear winter

205
00:13:46,418 --> 00:13:48,888
and all life on
earth will perish.

206
00:13:48,955 --> 00:13:50,789
[rumbling]

207
00:13:56,228 --> 00:13:57,562
What was that?

208
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:01,199
That's one of our
random phenomenon here,

209
00:14:01,266 --> 00:14:03,102
random explosions.

210
00:14:03,168 --> 00:14:04,670
Yet without the typical
acrid smell

211
00:14:04,736 --> 00:14:06,772
that accompanies bombs
and incendiary weapons.

212
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,374
We brought on a team from
the 71st Ordnance Group EOD

213
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:12,111
to investigate, but so far
they've turned up nothing.

214
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,745
You know what?

215
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,882
I should take
an initial reading here.

216
00:14:18,717 --> 00:14:19,952
[beeping]

217
00:14:23,355 --> 00:14:26,092
Okay, there are inordinately
high levels

218
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:29,261
of ambient sulfur dioxide.

219
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:30,362
It's being violently pushed
to the surface

220
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:32,131
by the volcanic pressure.

221
00:14:32,197 --> 00:14:34,733
That's most likely what's caused
the unexplained explosions.

222
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,003
Right, but would that cause
the levels of destruction

223
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,370
we've been experiencing?

224
00:14:38,437 --> 00:14:40,572
With readings like this,
absolutely, Major.

225
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,109
I mean, those gases
could literally vaporize

226
00:14:43,176 --> 00:14:44,743
anything they come
in contact with.

227
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,245
General Norris
set a 12-hour window?

228
00:14:47,312 --> 00:14:48,981
If that.

229
00:14:49,048 --> 00:14:52,885
But how many hours,
I can't say at this point.

230
00:14:52,952 --> 00:14:55,054
I'm gonna need to run more
tests at the actual site.

231
00:14:55,121 --> 00:14:58,790
And I need to locate the actual
epicenter of this disturbance.

232
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:01,760
Think you can stop it?

233
00:15:03,096 --> 00:15:05,932
That last tremor felt
to me like magnitude six.

234
00:15:05,998 --> 00:15:08,901
And they're just going to
get more intense with time.

235
00:15:08,968 --> 00:15:13,405
And based on the readings
I just took,

236
00:15:13,472 --> 00:15:15,540
we're too far along
in the process to attempt

237
00:15:15,607 --> 00:15:18,443
any depressurization or
aperture venting techniques.

238
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:23,582
So there's only one sure option
I can think of.

239
00:15:23,648 --> 00:15:25,617
How much ordnance can
you get on short notice?

240
00:15:25,684 --> 00:15:27,220
I'll get you whatever
you need, ma'am.

241
00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:29,188
Okay.

242
00:15:29,254 --> 00:15:31,023
I need to locate
the epicenter first.

243
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,894
Now we have a general
vicinity from Cal-Tech,

244
00:15:34,961 --> 00:15:36,695
this lake Lago Do Fodo.

245
00:15:36,762 --> 00:15:38,530
But it's my company that has

246
00:15:38,597 --> 00:15:41,500
the best geothermal targeting
software in the world.

247
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:44,636
And given that we're using
explosives on a grand scale,

248
00:15:44,703 --> 00:15:47,439
I'm gonna need to get as close
to the drop zone as possible,

249
00:15:47,506 --> 00:15:50,509
so that I can get a visual
reference on the actual

250
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,111
location of the epicenter.

251
00:15:52,178 --> 00:15:54,113
We cannot afford to be off
by even as much as two meters.

252
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,614
Copy.

253
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,250
Let me grab my man
from EOD to provide you

254
00:15:57,315 --> 00:15:58,683
safe escort to Lago Do Fodo

255
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,519
and if you
wouldn't mind standing

256
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,687
in the command bunker over there
to wait, it'll be safe.

257
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:05,158
Of course, Major,
but time is of the essence.

258
00:16:05,224 --> 00:16:06,458
Right away, ma'am.

259
00:16:06,525 --> 00:16:07,960
Based on what I've seen so far,

260
00:16:08,027 --> 00:16:09,628
I'm beginning to think
that we have a lot less

261
00:16:09,694 --> 00:16:11,264
than 12 hours
before the eruption.

262
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:12,564
Copy that, ma'am.

263
00:16:25,878 --> 00:16:27,412
[thunder]

264
00:16:32,018 --> 00:16:33,252
We getting close?

265
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:34,586
Approaching now, doctor.

266
00:17:01,314 --> 00:17:03,381
[beeping]

267
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,652
[beeping intensifies]

268
00:17:08,386 --> 00:17:10,022
Hey, Major?

269
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:12,457
How's your knowledge of recent
history in this part of Brazil?

270
00:17:12,524 --> 00:17:14,827
- Proficient.
- Okay.

271
00:17:14,894 --> 00:17:16,329
Well, volcanoes have
been extinct in this country

272
00:17:16,394 --> 00:17:18,597
for a very, very,
very long time.

273
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:21,167
Now I know that industry
has decimated the rain forest,

274
00:17:21,234 --> 00:17:24,769
but is there fracking or
any other seismic explorations

275
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:26,005
that you're aware
of in this part?

276
00:17:26,072 --> 00:17:27,706
Not that I know of.

277
00:17:27,772 --> 00:17:29,909
There have been reports of
large demolitions being used

278
00:17:29,976 --> 00:17:32,577
to clear foliage for
the pipelines out of Sergipe.

279
00:17:32,644 --> 00:17:33,880
Okay, that's good to know.

280
00:17:33,946 --> 00:17:35,647
[beeping]

281
00:17:35,714 --> 00:17:38,450
All right. I'm getting extremely
high levels of C02.

282
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,619
Now when C02 is detected
at the surface,

283
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,420
it means that new magma
is running

284
00:17:42,487 --> 00:17:44,123
into the volcanic system,

285
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,893
even though there isn't supposed
to be a volcanic system here.

286
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:49,661
Also, exorbitant levels
of sulfur dioxide,

287
00:17:49,728 --> 00:17:52,631
which indicates that the
magma is close to the surface

288
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,432
and eruption is definite.

289
00:17:54,499 --> 00:17:58,403
If these levels were any higher,
we wouldn't be able to breathe.

290
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:02,375
Also, judging by the intensity
and the increasing intensity

291
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,976
of the earthquakes,

292
00:18:04,043 --> 00:18:09,015
I would say that we are
well past the 12-hour mark.

293
00:18:09,081 --> 00:18:11,017
Eruption's gonna happen
in a few hours.

294
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:15,187
Now I can confirm
all the information

295
00:18:15,254 --> 00:18:16,923
in General Norris's report.

296
00:18:16,989 --> 00:18:21,559
This is the source of all of the
disturbances, this lake here.

297
00:18:21,626 --> 00:18:25,664
But without being able
to visually see the epicenter,

298
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,201
I'm gonna need to link up
with my company's satellite

299
00:18:29,268 --> 00:18:32,737
and get an infrared image below
the surface of the water

300
00:18:32,804 --> 00:18:35,341
so that we can pinpoint
the exact location

301
00:18:35,408 --> 00:18:38,144
of the fissure if we have
any hope of stopping this.

302
00:18:45,384 --> 00:18:46,685
This shouldn't take long.

303
00:18:59,131 --> 00:19:00,498
What's the matter?

304
00:19:02,368 --> 00:19:03,635
[beeping]

305
00:19:05,304 --> 00:19:06,906
I've lost the satellite link.

306
00:19:06,973 --> 00:19:08,441
I need that satellite link
if we're gonna

307
00:19:08,506 --> 00:19:10,409
find the location
of the fissure!

308
00:19:10,475 --> 00:19:12,078
I have to have it!

309
00:19:12,144 --> 00:19:14,380
We can do a hard patch through
our server back at Foxtrot.

310
00:19:14,447 --> 00:19:17,283
Okay.
Let's do that.

311
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,351
Let's Oscar Mike, Lieutenant.

312
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:21,087
Copy, sir.

313
00:19:21,153 --> 00:19:22,154
What is it, doctor?

314
00:19:22,221 --> 00:19:23,822
This fungus.

315
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:25,992
I'm practically an expert of
flora around volcanic sites.

316
00:19:26,058 --> 00:19:28,560
And I've never seen anything
like this before in my life.

317
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,762
When's your mycologist get here?

318
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,165
They should have been
here an hour ago.

319
00:19:33,232 --> 00:19:34,166
All right, let's get going.

320
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:35,267
Okay.

321
00:19:35,334 --> 00:19:36,268
Lieutenant, let's Oscar Mike.

322
00:19:36,335 --> 00:19:37,837
Yes, sir!

323
00:19:59,258 --> 00:20:00,860
[thunder]

324
00:20:01,927 --> 00:20:03,262
You got enough room?
You good?

325
00:20:03,329 --> 00:20:04,497
- Yes.
- Sorry.

326
00:20:04,562 --> 00:20:06,065
Did they say what
the holdup was?

327
00:20:06,132 --> 00:20:07,466
Yeah. There was another storm
between the airfield

328
00:20:07,532 --> 00:20:08,834
- and the destination.
- Oh.

329
00:20:08,901 --> 00:20:10,269
Why didn't they just
circumnavigate it?

330
00:20:10,336 --> 00:20:12,138
Because I didn't want to
risk taking us through

331
00:20:12,204 --> 00:20:13,738
rebel-controlled territory,
get shot at and kidnapped.

332
00:20:13,805 --> 00:20:15,640
Right.
Let's not do that.

333
00:20:15,707 --> 00:20:17,977
Yeah, please?

334
00:20:18,044 --> 00:20:18,978
Go Brazil.

335
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:20,479
[thunder]

336
00:20:20,545 --> 00:20:22,848
Whoa!
Look at that!

337
00:20:27,153 --> 00:20:28,820
I have never seen lightning
like that before in my life!

338
00:20:28,888 --> 00:20:30,923
Oh, God!
I hope Onyx is okay.

339
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,960
- Who's Onyx?
- Oh, he's my pup.

340
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:37,296
He's tough, but he does
not like thunderstorms.

341
00:20:37,363 --> 00:20:39,532
And I had to leave him
with my ex-girlfriend.

342
00:20:39,597 --> 00:20:41,400
I hate doing that.
I hate doing that.

343
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:45,037
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

344
00:20:45,104 --> 00:20:47,406
So is he.

345
00:20:47,473 --> 00:20:49,641
Poor boy's probably
behind a couch shaking.

346
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,944
Oh, I hate that.

347
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,985
How many times are you gonna
read through that thing?

348
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:01,921
- I'm a slow reader.
- I'm sorry.

349
00:21:04,656 --> 00:21:06,125
God, it is hot.

350
00:21:08,094 --> 00:21:09,794
It's 40 degrees Celsius outside.

351
00:21:09,862 --> 00:21:11,297
You know the crazy thing?

352
00:21:11,363 --> 00:21:13,365
10 minutes ago,
I would've sworn I was cold.

353
00:21:13,432 --> 00:21:15,700
I mean, look at this.
We're kicking up dust.

354
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:17,036
The air is drier than hell.

355
00:21:17,103 --> 00:21:18,270
I don't understand
what's going on.

356
00:21:18,337 --> 00:21:21,006
Whoa! Whoa!

357
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:26,846
That was an earthquake...
in the Amazon.

358
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,646
Hey, just get us safe
there, buddy, huh?

359
00:21:28,713 --> 00:21:31,383
You're doing a good job.
Everything's great.

360
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,384
Everybody's doing a good job.

361
00:21:32,451 --> 00:21:33,751
Look at that!

362
00:21:36,688 --> 00:21:41,693
Look at the trees, complete
absence of moss or lichens.

363
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,262
These things should be covered!

364
00:21:43,329 --> 00:21:46,731
I mean, but a catastrophic
climate shift

365
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:50,369
would dry out
all the tree trunks.

366
00:21:50,436 --> 00:21:52,471
But this is the rainforest,
it's not a desert.

367
00:21:52,538 --> 00:21:53,973
Exactly.
That's what I'm saying.

368
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:55,574
Maybe it's accelerated
warming at ground level

369
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,077
due to the extreme
weather cycles?

370
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:01,080
Which would suggest that
the weather patterns

371
00:22:01,147 --> 00:22:04,850
are subject to
the volcanic activity?

372
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:06,385
Yeah, absolutely.

373
00:22:06,452 --> 00:22:08,653
I mean, that is why
I'm here to figure out.

374
00:22:12,191 --> 00:22:13,125
[insect buzzes]

375
00:22:13,192 --> 00:22:14,260
What was that?

376
00:22:16,395 --> 00:22:17,830
It looked like a locust.

377
00:22:19,932 --> 00:22:22,201
Locusts go where
the climate's drying out.

378
00:22:22,268 --> 00:22:25,437
Yeah, but this place isn't gonna
be drying out anytime soon.

379
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:29,408
Look!
Look, look, look!

380
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:35,680
Oh, right... whoa.

381
00:22:35,747 --> 00:22:38,851
Yeah, before that gets here,

382
00:22:38,918 --> 00:22:40,419
we should stop and
take a quick look.

383
00:22:40,486 --> 00:22:41,719
See if we can't figure out
what's happened here

384
00:22:41,786 --> 00:22:42,922
in the last couple of hours.

385
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:44,023
You think that's
gonna be safe?

386
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:45,790
We'll stay close to the road.

387
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,361
- Okay. Let's do that.
- Yeah?

388
00:22:49,428 --> 00:22:51,063
All right. Hey, can you find
a good spot to pull over?

389
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,831
We wanna get out
and take a look.

390
00:22:52,898 --> 00:22:54,732
Thank you.

391
00:22:58,871 --> 00:23:01,006
- Let's hustle out.
- Okay.

392
00:23:02,474 --> 00:23:04,043
Okay.

393
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:07,846
[gunfire]

394
00:23:18,691 --> 00:23:21,527
[speaking Portuguese]

395
00:23:21,594 --> 00:23:24,263
Soldiers! This is Major Oakley
Jones, United States Army!

396
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,431
Major!

397
00:23:25,497 --> 00:23:28,133
Corporal Kyle Tremblay,
Canadian Army!

398
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,969
We're getting vermin out
of the area

399
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:31,704
and securing the jungle, sir!

400
00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:35,474
Corporal, we're under explicit
orders for nonlethal engagement!

401
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:37,142
Not anymore, Major!

402
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:38,978
We're getting fired on
and we're gonna fire back!

403
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:40,812
No more half measures, sir!

404
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:43,949
Corporal, you're in violation
of the United Nations SROE!

405
00:23:44,016 --> 00:23:47,553
Cease fire and fall back on
my position immediately!

406
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,154
Ahh!

407
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:50,189
I got him!

408
00:23:50,256 --> 00:23:52,925
Did you see that, Major?
I got him!

409
00:23:52,992 --> 00:23:54,727
Let him go, Lieutenant.

410
00:23:54,792 --> 00:23:56,662
Security for Dr. Hughes
is our priority.

411
00:23:56,729 --> 00:23:58,397
Yes, sir.

412
00:23:59,431 --> 00:24:01,834
[shouting]

413
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,469
Doctor!

414
00:24:03,535 --> 00:24:04,937
Wait.

415
00:24:05,004 --> 00:24:06,372
Someone is hurt.

416
00:24:06,438 --> 00:24:09,241
Okay, but stay behind me.

417
00:24:09,308 --> 00:24:11,844
Yes, sir.

418
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,988
[shouting]

419
00:24:35,868 --> 00:24:37,136
[panting]

420
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:40,906
[speaks Portuguese]

421
00:24:43,475 --> 00:24:44,877
Yes, I speak English.

422
00:24:44,943 --> 00:24:46,779
What's your name, son?

423
00:24:46,879 --> 00:24:48,480
Paulo.

424
00:24:48,547 --> 00:24:51,216
I'm Major Oakley Jones
with the United States Army.

425
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:52,985
We're gonna get you some
help, okay, Paulo?

426
00:24:53,052 --> 00:24:57,690
There's no help anymore...
for anyone.

427
00:24:57,756 --> 00:24:58,924
Okay, Paulo.
Hang on...

428
00:24:58,991 --> 00:25:01,026
You don't understand.

429
00:25:01,093 --> 00:25:04,997
Everyone is killing everyone.

430
00:25:05,064 --> 00:25:08,267
There's something... wrong.

431
00:25:08,334 --> 00:25:10,836
It's evil.

432
00:25:10,903 --> 00:25:12,938
[thunder]

433
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,888
[groans]

434
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:35,728
Foxtrot Command Scavenger.

435
00:25:35,794 --> 00:25:39,865
Request Medevac on my
immediate location... 1CI.

436
00:25:39,932 --> 00:25:41,400
Foxtrot, how do you read?

437
00:25:41,467 --> 00:25:43,302
Major, we've gotta get moving.
We gotta go fast.

438
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:45,070
We don't want
to get stuck in that.

439
00:25:45,137 --> 00:25:46,138
Okay. We're gonna have
to handle this ourselves.

440
00:25:46,205 --> 00:25:47,639
Let's get him loaded up.

441
00:25:47,706 --> 00:25:49,475
Major...

442
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:55,347
I never...

443
00:25:57,916 --> 00:26:03,922
I was just trying
to protect my crops.

444
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:09,128
That was the Fifth Seal...

445
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:11,296
those who are martyred
for their faith.

446
00:26:16,001 --> 00:26:17,669
Sergeant Wayne!

447
00:26:17,736 --> 00:26:20,606
Sir, we gotta get out of here.

448
00:26:20,672 --> 00:26:24,576
Okay, let's go.
Let's go, Sergeant.

449
00:26:45,931 --> 00:26:47,633
[tires screech]

450
00:26:51,003 --> 00:26:52,371
Look out!

451
00:27:00,446 --> 00:27:03,048
You guys better
get to higher ground.

452
00:27:03,115 --> 00:27:04,516
I have to get out of here.
Good luck.

453
00:27:10,522 --> 00:27:11,957
Go, go, go, go!

454
00:27:15,727 --> 00:27:16,962
[grunts]

455
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:22,334
[water rumbling]

456
00:27:25,471 --> 00:27:27,239
Ah, thank you.

457
00:27:45,691 --> 00:27:47,259
Wow!

458
00:27:52,064 --> 00:27:54,466
- You okay?
- Yeah.

459
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:55,601
Oh, that's...

460
00:28:06,378 --> 00:28:07,713
Well...
Well...

461
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:13,151
Looks like
we're gonna be here a bit.

462
00:28:33,138 --> 00:28:34,606
No disrespect, Major,
you really think

463
00:28:34,673 --> 00:28:36,775
this has something
to do with the Bible?

464
00:28:38,744 --> 00:28:41,246
I do. That I do.

465
00:28:43,148 --> 00:28:44,516
Time will tell.

466
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:46,818
Lt's just hope
preventing the Apocalypse

467
00:28:46,886 --> 00:28:48,620
is all part of God's plan.

468
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:50,355
Amen.

469
00:28:56,261 --> 00:28:57,864
Is that smoke?

470
00:28:57,931 --> 00:28:59,798
Something's wrong.

471
00:28:59,866 --> 00:29:01,133
Where is everybody?

472
00:29:02,734 --> 00:29:04,871
Man, that storm really put
an ass whooping on us, sir.

473
00:29:04,938 --> 00:29:07,539
Sure did, Sarge.

474
00:29:07,606 --> 00:29:08,975
Make a sweep.

475
00:29:09,042 --> 00:29:11,376
The other scientists should
have been here by now.

476
00:29:11,443 --> 00:29:12,578
Yes, sir.

477
00:29:12,644 --> 00:29:15,380
Where do you think
everyone went?

478
00:29:15,447 --> 00:29:17,349
Don't know. No signs of
firefight.

479
00:29:17,416 --> 00:29:19,651
There are no shell casings
or small weapons damage.

480
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:22,287
Would they have fled
because of the storm?

481
00:29:22,354 --> 00:29:23,789
No signs of rapid departure.

482
00:29:23,856 --> 00:29:25,824
Conditions are bad,
but they'd be better off

483
00:29:25,892 --> 00:29:27,326
just hunkering down.

484
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:40,772
Major, we need to reestablish
that satellite link now.

485
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,541
Okay, but just hold on.

486
00:29:42,608 --> 00:29:44,476
As soon as the base is cleared,
we'll get the power running.

487
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:56,321
Sir, it looks like the lightning
took out our generators,

488
00:29:56,388 --> 00:29:59,224
So we've got no power?
Can we fix it?

489
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:00,927
Not fast enough.

490
00:30:00,994 --> 00:30:02,661
There's a radio station a few
klicks from here we can try.

491
00:30:02,728 --> 00:30:03,963
If it's not damaged,

492
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,032
we can get you linked up
to the satellite there.

493
00:30:06,099 --> 00:30:07,566
Then what are we waiting for?

494
00:30:07,633 --> 00:30:09,701
All right, let's Oscar Mike.

495
00:30:29,821 --> 00:30:31,090
So what's the plan?

496
00:30:31,156 --> 00:30:33,458
I don't know.

497
00:30:33,525 --> 00:30:36,095
We were going that way, but the
road disappears into the trees.

498
00:30:36,161 --> 00:30:39,231
If it takes a bend, there's
a fork in the road...

499
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,368
I think we need to signal
for help somehow.

500
00:30:49,042 --> 00:30:50,575
Do you have any matches?

501
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:52,879
Or a lighter?
Or anything?

502
00:30:52,945 --> 00:30:55,148
I have some hygroscopic flares.

503
00:30:55,213 --> 00:30:57,382
I was gonna do some cloud
seeding for the fires. Why?

504
00:30:57,449 --> 00:31:00,786
Yeah, yeah, that'll work.
Let me have one.

505
00:31:00,853 --> 00:31:02,055
What are you thinking?

506
00:31:02,121 --> 00:31:03,755
I'm thinking I start a fire

507
00:31:03,822 --> 00:31:06,358
and try the old smoke
signal routine.

508
00:31:06,425 --> 00:31:08,061
Do you think
that's a good idea?

509
00:31:08,127 --> 00:31:09,628
Do you have a better one?

510
00:31:09,695 --> 00:31:11,263
Look, with the timeframe
that we're on,

511
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:13,032
we can't afford
for help to come to us.

512
00:31:13,099 --> 00:31:15,367
We need to get back to the
rest of the group, ASAP.

513
00:31:15,434 --> 00:31:18,670
Yeah, that...
Okay, that makes sense.

514
00:31:18,737 --> 00:31:20,539
Look, I've done it
a couple of times.

515
00:31:20,605 --> 00:31:22,507
I was in the Boy Scouts.
It'll be fine.

516
00:31:22,574 --> 00:31:23,876
Here.

517
00:31:31,283 --> 00:31:32,317
Be careful.

518
00:31:32,384 --> 00:31:34,386
Get Scavenger on the line.

519
00:31:34,453 --> 00:31:36,555
Right away, ma'am.

520
00:31:37,622 --> 00:31:39,291
- Scavenger. Zeus.
- [static]

521
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:40,659
How do you read?

522
00:31:40,726 --> 00:31:41,727
Scavenger!

523
00:31:41,793 --> 00:31:44,097
Would somebody fix
these damn comms?

524
00:31:44,163 --> 00:31:45,564
Yes, Aidan.

525
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:48,201
We've lost communication
with Foxtrot Command.

526
00:31:48,266 --> 00:31:49,768
Looks like the problem
is on their end,

527
00:31:49,836 --> 00:31:51,536
and not necessarily
from storm interference.

528
00:31:51,603 --> 00:31:54,506
We did receive confirmation
that Doctor Rodney

529
00:31:54,573 --> 00:31:56,541
and Doctor Lenna landed
safely at the airfield.

530
00:31:56,608 --> 00:31:59,112
But then we lost communication
with their transport

531
00:31:59,178 --> 00:32:00,512
enroute to Foxtrot.

532
00:32:00,579 --> 00:32:01,881
Contact the 4th Fleet.

533
00:32:01,948 --> 00:32:03,749
I want to err on the
side of caution

534
00:32:03,815 --> 00:32:05,517
that possibly they could have
had a vehicle breakdown

535
00:32:05,584 --> 00:32:08,855
or worse, could have
encountered rebel resistance.

536
00:32:08,921 --> 00:32:11,023
I want a pararescue
team deployed

537
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,457
to their last known location
immediately.

538
00:32:12,524 --> 00:32:13,860
Yes, General.

539
00:32:15,828 --> 00:32:17,496
[static]

540
00:32:44,891 --> 00:32:47,026
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

541
00:32:52,131 --> 00:32:53,598
No...

542
00:33:09,015 --> 00:33:11,817
Wait a minute.
Are those smoke signals?

543
00:33:13,186 --> 00:33:14,987
- 12:00!
- I see it.

544
00:33:20,293 --> 00:33:21,760
Look out!

545
00:33:22,829 --> 00:33:24,897
- Hold tight!
- [tires squeal]

546
00:33:28,067 --> 00:33:30,335
Elliot! Elliot!
I think I see a car!

547
00:33:30,402 --> 00:33:31,871
- Hey! Hey!
- Dakota, wait!

548
00:33:31,938 --> 00:33:34,106
Is that one of
your scientists up there?

549
00:33:34,173 --> 00:33:35,440
I don't know who
else it could be.

550
00:33:35,507 --> 00:33:37,576
No civilians out
this deep in the bush.

551
00:33:38,978 --> 00:33:41,214
No, no, no!
Dakota, it's not safe!

552
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,614
We don't know who they are!

553
00:33:44,217 --> 00:33:45,450
Dakota!

554
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,228
Dr. Dakota Lenna?

555
00:33:55,294 --> 00:33:57,163
- Yes. Major Jones?
- Affirmative.

556
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:59,098
Do you know the whereabouts
of Dr. Elliot Rodney?

557
00:33:59,165 --> 00:34:02,767
Yes. He's the one making
the smoke signals.

558
00:34:02,835 --> 00:34:03,735
There he is!

559
00:34:03,802 --> 00:34:06,072
- [locust buzzes]
- Ah!

560
00:34:06,138 --> 00:34:07,606
What the...

561
00:34:11,043 --> 00:34:13,778
Come on!
Come on!

562
00:34:14,546 --> 00:34:15,848
Dakota!

563
00:34:19,784 --> 00:34:21,153
Get in!

564
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,455
Let's go, guys.

565
00:34:23,521 --> 00:34:24,891
Dr. Elliot Rodney?

566
00:34:24,957 --> 00:34:28,560
That's me!
Nice to meet you.

567
00:34:28,627 --> 00:34:29,929
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come on!

568
00:34:29,996 --> 00:34:31,097
Let's go.

569
00:34:36,903 --> 00:34:38,670
Come on!

570
00:34:47,213 --> 00:34:48,446
Are those locusts?

571
00:34:48,513 --> 00:34:51,416
Yes!
There's a lot of them, too!

572
00:34:53,986 --> 00:34:54,987
Come on, come on!

573
00:34:55,054 --> 00:34:56,255
Doesn't this thing
go any faster?

574
00:34:56,322 --> 00:34:57,722
Going as fast as I can, doctor!

575
00:35:00,525 --> 00:35:02,694
Major, how good of
a shot are you?

576
00:35:02,761 --> 00:35:06,232
Did three tours in Afghanistan
as a forward recon sniper. Why?

577
00:35:06,299 --> 00:35:08,034
Yeah?
That'll do it.

578
00:35:13,339 --> 00:35:15,074
Metharizium acridum!

579
00:35:15,141 --> 00:35:16,741
What, is that like a bug bomb?

580
00:35:16,808 --> 00:35:18,576
Kinda, it's a
fungal-oil based compound

581
00:35:18,643 --> 00:35:21,613
that disrupts
their oxygen exchange.

582
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,349
Basically kills them without
killing everything else.

583
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:24,783
Oh, God, that's so clever.

584
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:26,185
It wouldn't destroy
all of the birds,

585
00:35:26,252 --> 00:35:27,652
and it wouldn't kill off
their food chain supply.

586
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:29,021
Exactly, exactly.

587
00:35:29,088 --> 00:35:30,890
The fungus attaches to
the exoskeleton

588
00:35:30,957 --> 00:35:32,791
and disrupts their exchange
of oxygen,

589
00:35:32,858 --> 00:35:37,196
causing organic death without
spreading to other species.

590
00:35:37,263 --> 00:35:38,697
Do you spray it?

591
00:35:38,763 --> 00:35:40,132
No, I usually do a
controlled burn in the fields.

592
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:42,534
But the canister itself
is pressurized.

593
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,869
If the major puts
a bullet through it,

594
00:35:43,936 --> 00:35:46,405
it should explode
dispensing a cloud

595
00:35:46,471 --> 00:35:49,842
- It's worth a shot.
- Genius.

596
00:35:51,476 --> 00:35:53,645
- Yeah?
- Okay, let's do it.

597
00:35:53,712 --> 00:35:55,547
Cover your ears.
This gunshot's gonna be loud.

598
00:35:55,613 --> 00:35:57,883
On your count, Major!
On your command!

599
00:36:01,586 --> 00:36:03,555
- Ah!
- I got you!

600
00:36:05,091 --> 00:36:05,824
Thank you.

601
00:36:05,891 --> 00:36:08,861
- Major!
- Hold!

602
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,568
Now!

603
00:36:16,634 --> 00:36:18,170
[gunshot]

604
00:36:19,305 --> 00:36:21,273
Nice shot!

605
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,275
[chattering]

606
00:36:25,478 --> 00:36:27,179
Nice shooting, Major.

607
00:36:33,518 --> 00:36:35,121
What happened
to your transport?

608
00:36:35,187 --> 00:36:38,823
We stopped to do some tests
and there was a flash flood.

609
00:36:38,891 --> 00:36:41,260
It took it and our driver
away with it.

610
00:36:43,396 --> 00:36:45,865
Hey, I didn't get your
guys' names, by the way.

611
00:36:45,931 --> 00:36:47,900
Apologies.
Major Oakley Jones.

612
00:36:47,967 --> 00:36:49,734
This is Sergeant Shockley,

613
00:36:49,801 --> 00:36:51,803
Lieutenant Rohrbacher,
United States Army.

614
00:36:51,871 --> 00:36:53,605
Nice to meet you guys.

615
00:36:53,671 --> 00:36:55,007
Thanks for saving
our asses back there.

616
00:36:55,074 --> 00:36:57,276
Pleasure to meet you,
Elliot Rodney.

617
00:36:57,343 --> 00:36:58,777
Dakota Lenna.

618
00:36:58,844 --> 00:37:00,946
Lynise Hughes.
Glad to make your acquaintances,

619
00:37:01,013 --> 00:37:03,849
albeit I wish it was
under better circumstances.

620
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:06,018
Hell, maybe can all go for a
beer after this is over, huh?

621
00:37:06,085 --> 00:37:07,353
I hope so.

622
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,822
Major, where are we going?

623
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,192
Radio tower.
Comms were down back at base.

624
00:37:13,259 --> 00:37:15,261
Dr. Hughes needs to patch
into her satellite network.

625
00:37:15,327 --> 00:37:16,996
Yeah.

626
00:37:17,063 --> 00:37:19,798
I'm confident that I've located
the epicenter for the eruption.

627
00:37:19,865 --> 00:37:22,835
But now I need to
pinpoint an exact location.

628
00:37:22,902 --> 00:37:25,037
What is your proposed
plan of action?

629
00:37:25,104 --> 00:37:26,272
Bomb it.

630
00:37:26,338 --> 00:37:28,407
Seriously?
In the middle of the Amazon?

631
00:37:28,474 --> 00:37:29,808
Well, we don't have much time.

632
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,444
And we're too far along in
the process

633
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,979
to attempt depressurization or
aperture venting techniques.

634
00:37:34,046 --> 00:37:35,713
So this is the only
chance we have

635
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,682
of stopping it from destroying
the entire world.

636
00:37:37,749 --> 00:37:40,585
That's why I need
to determine the exact location

637
00:37:40,652 --> 00:37:42,787
and the exact drop point.

638
00:37:42,855 --> 00:37:45,958
Also, at the rate these
earthquakes are escalating,

639
00:37:46,025 --> 00:37:48,828
my guess is this eruption
is coming sooner, not later.

640
00:37:48,894 --> 00:37:50,930
I need to get the SAT link
up and running

641
00:37:50,996 --> 00:37:52,865
so that I can determine
the exact timeframe

642
00:37:52,932 --> 00:37:54,632
before the eruption.

643
00:37:54,699 --> 00:37:56,302
Oh, Elliot, I meant to ask you.

644
00:37:56,368 --> 00:37:58,104
I saw a fungus at the site
that did not look familiar.

645
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,905
Orange palette?
Black spots?

646
00:37:59,972 --> 00:38:01,140
- Kinda looks like carrots?
- Yeah! So you've seen it?

647
00:38:01,207 --> 00:38:02,441
Yes, indeed.

648
00:38:02,508 --> 00:38:03,876
I have a sample of it
with me here in my bag.

649
00:38:03,943 --> 00:38:04,910
As soon as we get
to the station,

650
00:38:04,977 --> 00:38:06,278
I'll set up a field test.

651
00:38:06,345 --> 00:38:08,013
to determine whether or
not it's related

652
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,148
to the geothermal activity
we've been experiencing.

653
00:38:09,215 --> 00:38:10,015
Great.

654
00:38:10,082 --> 00:38:11,350
Whoo, this is up here, huh?

655
00:38:12,784 --> 00:38:13,953
What about you, Dr. Lenna?

656
00:38:14,019 --> 00:38:15,421
In my professional opinion,

657
00:38:15,488 --> 00:38:17,456
these are clearly
unpredictable weather cycles,

658
00:38:17,523 --> 00:38:18,991
but it's not distinct.

659
00:38:19,058 --> 00:38:21,693
It's definitely
the geothermal-related,

660
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:22,995
based upon all of your tests.

661
00:38:23,062 --> 00:38:25,931
But these erratic weather
patterns

662
00:38:25,998 --> 00:38:27,900
are definitely coming
from all

663
00:38:27,967 --> 00:38:31,703
of these potential
volcanic eruptions.

664
00:38:31,769 --> 00:38:33,973
And it's coming from
this immediate area.

665
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:35,941
How much farther, Sergeant?

666
00:38:36,008 --> 00:38:37,409
Almost there, ma'am.

667
00:38:43,983 --> 00:38:47,119
Okay, we're gonna need to
pull over here and go on foot.

668
00:38:47,186 --> 00:38:48,988
If there are any
rebel hold outs,

669
00:38:49,054 --> 00:38:51,023
we can't run the risk of
them hearing our vehicle.

670
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,074
Stay alert.

671
00:39:24,523 --> 00:39:27,193
This way.

672
00:39:27,259 --> 00:39:28,060
[horse neighs]

673
00:39:28,127 --> 00:39:29,395
Wait. Does anyone else hear...

674
00:39:29,461 --> 00:39:31,063
Stay close and stay quiet.

675
00:39:55,621 --> 00:39:57,755
- You okay, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

676
00:39:57,822 --> 00:39:59,358
A headache coming on.

677
00:40:04,296 --> 00:40:07,199
Stay behind us. There's been
rebel activity in this area.

678
00:40:07,266 --> 00:40:08,334
Copy that.

679
00:40:11,136 --> 00:40:12,605
This is never going to work.

680
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:13,738
Why not?

681
00:40:13,805 --> 00:40:15,140
Just look at it.

682
00:40:20,212 --> 00:40:21,880
Once we know the area is secure,

683
00:40:21,947 --> 00:40:23,415
I'll get the radio
tower up and running.

684
00:40:23,482 --> 00:40:24,450
Good.

685
00:40:24,516 --> 00:40:26,218
After we locate the epicenter,

686
00:40:26,285 --> 00:40:28,587
it's just a matter of collapsing
the volcano's magma chamber.

687
00:40:28,654 --> 00:40:30,755
The Pentagon should be
able to provide enough ordnance

688
00:40:30,822 --> 00:40:32,324
to get the job done.

689
00:40:32,391 --> 00:40:34,627
If we're successful,
the cataclysmic weather events

690
00:40:34,693 --> 00:40:36,829
should dissipate worldwide.

691
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:39,131
Assuming all of our
findings are sound.

692
00:40:39,198 --> 00:40:42,067
Correct. Bottom line,
it's the best chance we have.

693
00:40:58,217 --> 00:40:59,585
Clear!

694
00:40:59,652 --> 00:41:00,986
Lead us in, Sergeant.

695
00:41:35,788 --> 00:41:38,390
Hold, hold...

696
00:41:38,457 --> 00:41:40,025
Move out.

697
00:41:42,428 --> 00:41:43,962
Follow me.

698
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:06,552
Sergeant, on the perimeter!

699
00:42:12,758 --> 00:42:14,259
[coughing]

700
00:42:15,461 --> 00:42:17,963
[panting]

701
00:42:25,504 --> 00:42:27,906
Shockley! On the perimeter!
Now, soldier!

702
00:42:29,208 --> 00:42:31,443
I need that sat link ASAP!

703
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,578
[radio static]

704
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,347
I can't get a clear channel.

705
00:42:35,414 --> 00:42:38,083
- Well, keep trying.
- I am trying!

706
00:42:42,688 --> 00:42:44,089
If today I lose my hope, Lord,

707
00:42:44,156 --> 00:42:46,458
please remind me
that Your plans are greater.

708
00:42:50,963 --> 00:42:52,197
Hey, that storm is coming in.

709
00:42:52,264 --> 00:42:53,966
We better have good
radios, otherwise

710
00:42:54,032 --> 00:42:56,068
on the tower
there won't be a signal.

711
00:42:56,135 --> 00:42:59,873
In a building this old?
Yeah, sure.

712
00:42:59,938 --> 00:43:01,373
How's it going, major?

713
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,474
[static]

714
00:43:04,676 --> 00:43:07,346
How's it going?
Major!

715
00:43:07,413 --> 00:43:09,615
I think the issue's
on the tower itself.

716
00:43:09,681 --> 00:43:11,083
Lieutenant!

717
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:20,759
I'm gonna go examine
my funky specimens.

718
00:43:20,826 --> 00:43:24,363
But I need to do that away
from everybody, just in case.

719
00:43:25,497 --> 00:43:27,366
I'll be back
when I have something.

720
00:43:27,433 --> 00:43:30,402
Okay.

721
00:43:30,469 --> 00:43:33,639
Sergeant Shockley?
Sergeant!

722
00:43:35,007 --> 00:43:37,109
He's not our priority right now.
That is!

723
00:43:37,176 --> 00:43:39,144
Come on.
Let's find the access ladder.

724
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:44,183
Look, I need to know the
exact epicenter of the volcano

725
00:43:44,249 --> 00:43:46,051
so I know how much
ordnance that we need.

726
00:43:46,118 --> 00:43:48,020
And I cannot do that
without a sat link.

727
00:43:48,086 --> 00:43:49,488
Right, okay.

728
00:44:13,645 --> 00:44:16,248
You, um, you said you had taken
some tests earlier.

729
00:44:16,315 --> 00:44:18,383
Can you share some of
that information with me?

730
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:19,853
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, great.

731
00:44:19,919 --> 00:44:21,587
So. This was taken earlier.

732
00:44:21,653 --> 00:44:23,188
Obviously, it's not
a livestream

733
00:44:23,255 --> 00:44:24,623
because we don't have
satellite access,

734
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:27,793
but you see all these
clouds dispersing?

735
00:44:27,861 --> 00:44:29,661
So they all disperse,

736
00:44:29,728 --> 00:44:31,396
and then they
come back together,

737
00:44:31,463 --> 00:44:34,299
which means that there are
all correlated,

738
00:44:34,366 --> 00:44:36,134
they're not independent
from one another.

739
00:44:36,201 --> 00:44:37,736
Yeah, that's great that
you can confirm that.

740
00:44:37,803 --> 00:44:39,171
Exactly.

741
00:44:39,238 --> 00:44:40,372
And you see all these
weather conditions?

742
00:44:40,439 --> 00:44:41,707
Uh-huh.

743
00:44:41,773 --> 00:44:44,109
This is what's causing all
the locust infestations.

744
00:44:44,176 --> 00:44:45,711
- Copy that.
- Yeah.

745
00:44:45,777 --> 00:44:49,214
Okay, so the last piece of
the puzzle is that fungus.

746
00:44:49,281 --> 00:44:50,950
We need to figure out if
that's connected as well.

747
00:44:51,016 --> 00:44:52,784
Right.

748
00:44:52,852 --> 00:44:54,086
I'm gonna check on Elliot.

749
00:44:54,152 --> 00:44:55,687
Shouldn't you put a mask on?

750
00:44:55,754 --> 00:44:58,490
Oh, I'm not gonna go in.
I'm just gonna check on him.

751
00:44:58,557 --> 00:44:59,291
Yeah, yeah, yeah?

752
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:00,626
- Elliot?
- What?

753
00:45:00,692 --> 00:45:02,060
How's it going in there?

754
00:45:02,127 --> 00:45:03,362
I'm almost done.

755
00:45:03,795 --> 00:45:04,696
Great!

756
00:45:12,104 --> 00:45:14,406
How's it looking, Major?

757
00:45:14,473 --> 00:45:18,277
Yeah, looks like the tower
got hit by lightning.

758
00:45:19,411 --> 00:45:21,513
Just burned out some
circuits and wires.

759
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:25,083
I'm repairing them...
repairing them now.

760
00:45:27,352 --> 00:45:30,389
Just a few more minutes.
Any sign of the Sergeant?

761
00:45:31,189 --> 00:45:33,258
[rumbling]

762
00:45:41,034 --> 00:45:42,634
I'm gonna go check on the Major.

763
00:45:44,871 --> 00:45:46,672
Major?

764
00:45:46,738 --> 00:45:48,607
Major, where are you?

765
00:45:48,674 --> 00:45:50,375
Up here!

766
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:53,545
I'm coming.

767
00:45:58,216 --> 00:46:00,285
I'm hung up.

768
00:46:00,352 --> 00:46:02,421
- Ah!
- There we go.

769
00:46:05,157 --> 00:46:07,459
- Thank you.
- Of course.

770
00:46:07,526 --> 00:46:09,261
We can't afford to lose you.

771
00:46:10,295 --> 00:46:11,965
How is it?

772
00:46:12,031 --> 00:46:15,500
Just some burned out wires.

773
00:46:15,567 --> 00:46:17,202
- It should work now.
- Great.

774
00:46:17,269 --> 00:46:19,438
- I'll meet you back down there.
- Okay.

775
00:46:27,046 --> 00:46:30,083
- Are my men inside with you?
- No, I haven't seen them.

776
00:46:31,416 --> 00:46:32,718
I'll be in in a second.

777
00:46:38,091 --> 00:46:40,659
Shockley, what are you... whoa!

778
00:46:45,731 --> 00:46:47,299
[grunts]

779
00:46:52,137 --> 00:46:53,840
Ah!

780
00:47:14,027 --> 00:47:16,161
How bad is it, Lieutenant?

781
00:47:16,228 --> 00:47:17,329
He got me in the oblique.
Missed the organs.

782
00:47:17,396 --> 00:47:18,965
I'm okay, sir.

783
00:47:19,032 --> 00:47:20,232
The antenna's working.
You have some paracord on you?

784
00:47:20,298 --> 00:47:21,700
Yes, sir.

785
00:47:21,767 --> 00:47:23,301
Bind Shockley, then
there's a skin stapler

786
00:47:23,368 --> 00:47:24,636
in the first aid kit
in the Jeep.

787
00:47:24,703 --> 00:47:26,672
- Close that wound up.
- Yes, sir.

788
00:47:28,273 --> 00:47:30,009
And be careful.

789
00:47:30,076 --> 00:47:31,209
Shockley's burning up.

790
00:47:31,276 --> 00:47:33,445
Could be malaria... or worse.

791
00:47:36,615 --> 00:47:38,517
Sergeant Shockley became ill.

792
00:47:38,583 --> 00:47:40,419
The Lieutenant's
outside binding him now.

793
00:47:40,485 --> 00:47:42,320
I just put him to sleep.

794
00:47:42,387 --> 00:47:43,822
Anybody starts feeling bad,
speak up.

795
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:46,859
This is a particularly
bad case of malaria.

796
00:47:46,926 --> 00:47:48,794
Dr. Hughes, what's the status?

797
00:47:48,861 --> 00:47:50,228
I'm working on
establishing a link.

798
00:47:50,295 --> 00:47:51,396
It should be ready in a minute.

799
00:47:51,463 --> 00:47:53,432
Okay.
Let me call the General.

800
00:47:55,068 --> 00:47:56,268
Zeus. Scavenger?

801
00:47:56,334 --> 00:47:59,638
Zeus. Scavenger.
Come in, Zeus.

802
00:47:59,705 --> 00:48:01,841
Zeus. Scavenger.

803
00:48:01,908 --> 00:48:03,910
Zeus, we've been trying to
hail you for some time now.

804
00:48:03,976 --> 00:48:06,045
Foxtrot was just hit bad
by the storms, General,

805
00:48:06,112 --> 00:48:07,512
disabling comms.

806
00:48:07,579 --> 00:48:09,082
We've had to mobilize offsite.

807
00:48:09,148 --> 00:48:10,983
But our guests have
narrowed down the location

808
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:15,287
of the disturbance and arrived
at a plan on how to proceed.

809
00:48:15,353 --> 00:48:16,822
Go ahead.

810
00:48:16,889 --> 00:48:19,125
The only option we have is
to drop massive ordnance

811
00:48:19,192 --> 00:48:22,527
on the epicenter
and seal the vent.

812
00:48:22,594 --> 00:48:25,630
I'm requesting air assistance
to deliver a GBU-43B

813
00:48:25,697 --> 00:48:29,768
to location coordinates
soon to follow, ma'am.

814
00:48:29,836 --> 00:48:32,671
Understood.
I'll contact the 4th Fleet.

815
00:48:32,738 --> 00:48:36,142
I'll send a Black Hawk and two
Chinooks to evac your team.

816
00:48:36,209 --> 00:48:38,211
One with a GBU-43B
and the other

817
00:48:38,276 --> 00:48:40,012
with a Massive
Ordnance Penetrator.

818
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:44,016
If one or both of those don't
do the trick, then God help us.

819
00:48:44,083 --> 00:48:45,450
Yes, General.

820
00:48:45,517 --> 00:48:48,320
Confirmation ordnance
request received, ETA...

821
00:48:48,386 --> 00:48:49,688
three hours.

822
00:48:49,755 --> 00:48:51,323
What are your
target coordinates?

823
00:48:51,389 --> 00:48:52,758
I should have them
in a couple of minutes.

824
00:48:52,824 --> 00:48:54,160
It's just everything
is still running slow

825
00:48:54,227 --> 00:48:55,560
because of all the storms.

826
00:48:55,627 --> 00:48:59,264
Stand by for exact
coordinates, General.

827
00:48:59,331 --> 00:49:00,766
Copy. Standing by.

828
00:49:04,336 --> 00:49:06,038
Sergeant Shockley
is secured, sir.

829
00:49:06,105 --> 00:49:07,472
Good, Lieutenant.

830
00:49:13,812 --> 00:49:15,280
[beeping]

831
00:49:16,414 --> 00:49:17,850
General?

832
00:49:24,623 --> 00:49:27,492
Scavenger, we're detecting
a massive storm system

833
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:30,295
headed straight for your
vicinity, ETA 30 minutes.

834
00:49:30,362 --> 00:49:32,397
Advise you to take cover.

835
00:49:33,166 --> 00:49:34,499
We're inside a solid structure

836
00:49:34,566 --> 00:49:36,936
to ride out any
inclement weather, Zeus.

837
00:49:37,003 --> 00:49:39,138
Copy that.

838
00:49:39,205 --> 00:49:40,907
Do you have those
coordinates yet?

839
00:49:40,973 --> 00:49:43,009
Yes, it's um...

840
00:49:43,075 --> 00:49:44,543
[rumbling]

841
00:49:53,986 --> 00:49:55,087
Everybody okay?

842
00:49:57,656 --> 00:49:59,391
That was the worst one yet.

843
00:49:59,457 --> 00:50:00,860
[creaking]

844
00:50:04,796 --> 00:50:06,966
[crashing]

845
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:10,502
Oh, God!
We lost the connection!

846
00:50:10,569 --> 00:50:13,272
Sounded like the
radio antenna, sir!

847
00:50:13,338 --> 00:50:14,706
Zeus.
Scavenger...

848
00:50:16,541 --> 00:50:17,542
We lost them.

849
00:50:17,609 --> 00:50:19,678
Let's go check out the antenna.

850
00:50:19,744 --> 00:50:22,380
I have to go secure
those samples.

851
00:50:53,012 --> 00:50:54,579
Antenna is wasted.

852
00:50:54,646 --> 00:50:55,915
Crumpled like a tin can
with that last earthquake.

853
00:50:55,982 --> 00:50:57,283
No, Major.
I need the satellite link!

854
00:50:57,350 --> 00:50:58,985
I understand!

855
00:50:59,051 --> 00:51:00,987
Look, there's an abandoned
airfield north of Lago Do Fodo.

856
00:51:01,053 --> 00:51:03,289
We can try to link up there,
but it was rebel-controlled.

857
00:51:03,356 --> 00:51:04,723
Okay.
Well, we have no choice.

858
00:51:04,789 --> 00:51:06,158
How close is it to the lake?

859
00:51:06,225 --> 00:51:07,759
It's right on the water.

860
00:51:07,826 --> 00:51:09,594
Plus, there's old helicopters
and heavy ordnance.

861
00:51:09,661 --> 00:51:12,031
Failsafe if anything
happens to our air assets.

862
00:51:12,098 --> 00:51:13,798
Okay then, let's do that.

863
00:51:13,866 --> 00:51:15,767
At least we'll have some options
if it comes to that.

864
00:51:15,835 --> 00:51:17,502
- Let's go.
- What about the Sergeant, sir?

865
00:51:17,569 --> 00:51:19,071
Escaped.
I found his kit by the antenna.

866
00:51:19,138 --> 00:51:20,405
We'll have to move
on without him.

867
00:51:20,472 --> 00:51:22,474
Elliot, let's go!

868
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:40,792
Stay low and move quick.

869
00:51:58,411 --> 00:52:00,445
[thunder]

870
00:52:16,228 --> 00:52:18,064
Hey, Elliot, did you get
a chance to learn anything

871
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:19,664
from the fungus
samples you took?

872
00:52:19,731 --> 00:52:21,834
Oh, yeah, yeah.
More bad news.

873
00:52:21,901 --> 00:52:24,236
As if we need more of that.

874
00:52:24,303 --> 00:52:29,641
Well, this fungi is similar
to a rhodotorula graminis.

875
00:52:29,708 --> 00:52:31,543
That's a fungus
found in volcanoes.

876
00:52:31,609 --> 00:52:33,913
Yes, but unlike that one,
this one

877
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:35,680
has an additional membrane
which indicates

878
00:52:35,747 --> 00:52:37,816
it originates in water...
likely the lake.

879
00:52:37,883 --> 00:52:40,652
The bad news is that
it's laced with toxins.

880
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:42,787
So like most fungi,

881
00:52:42,855 --> 00:52:44,457
if the structural integrity
is comprised,

882
00:52:44,522 --> 00:52:47,026
say, for example, if you step
on it, it releases spores.

883
00:52:47,093 --> 00:52:48,861
So as far as
the major's theory goes,

884
00:52:48,928 --> 00:52:50,997
that it's a malaria outbreak,

885
00:52:51,063 --> 00:52:54,266
it's probably actually
this little fungi responsible

886
00:52:54,333 --> 00:52:56,601
for all the symptoms,
the disorientation

887
00:52:56,668 --> 00:52:58,703
and fever and stuff.

888
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:01,173
Yeah, and also with all storms
and the weather cycles,

889
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,109
the precipitation's most
likely carrying

890
00:53:03,175 --> 00:53:04,477
all the spores into
the upper atmosphere.

891
00:53:04,542 --> 00:53:05,777
Correct.

892
00:53:05,845 --> 00:53:07,512
As far as mitigating
the infection,

893
00:53:07,579 --> 00:53:09,748
a high dose of oxygen should be
enough to suffocate the fungi.

894
00:53:13,618 --> 00:53:15,855
Major! We gotta go!

895
00:53:20,459 --> 00:53:22,962
Everybody!
Get in the truck now!

896
00:53:32,204 --> 00:53:34,739
Looks like our route
is blocked by the wildfire.

897
00:53:34,806 --> 00:53:35,841
We'll be safer closer to
the lake,

898
00:53:35,908 --> 00:53:37,209
but we have to go on foot.

899
00:53:48,487 --> 00:53:49,889
This way.

900
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:53,125
The lake is only
a few miles ahead.

901
00:54:12,845 --> 00:54:14,046
There's the air base.

902
00:54:14,113 --> 00:54:16,015
Follow this river
bed around to it.

903
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:23,522
Hey, guys?

904
00:54:23,588 --> 00:54:24,823
I'm gonna catch right up.

905
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:26,392
I wanna grab a
quick water sample

906
00:54:26,459 --> 00:54:29,361
and verify that the fungus
is indeed from here.

907
00:54:29,428 --> 00:54:30,529
I'll stay with you.

908
00:54:30,595 --> 00:54:31,931
I'll hang back and cover them.

909
00:54:33,265 --> 00:54:38,037
Fungus has to exist in a
relatively low acid environment.

910
00:54:38,104 --> 00:54:40,039
I'm wondering if this
is the place.

911
00:54:41,706 --> 00:54:43,542
Sounds like a plan.

912
00:54:43,608 --> 00:54:44,809
With that added membrane...

913
00:54:44,877 --> 00:54:46,778
I'm pretty sure...

914
00:54:50,648 --> 00:54:52,784
that this is the body
of water it's in.

915
00:55:00,392 --> 00:55:03,095
Let's hold. I don't wanna
separate the group too far.

916
00:55:03,162 --> 00:55:04,662
Major, we're running
out of time.

917
00:55:04,729 --> 00:55:06,465
I can't do anything
without that link.

918
00:55:06,532 --> 00:55:08,134
Under normal circumstances,

919
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,936
the volcanic activity would
make the lake highly acidic.

920
00:55:15,274 --> 00:55:16,408
Water pH is 8.5.

921
00:55:16,475 --> 00:55:18,643
This is definitely
the source of the fungus.

922
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:20,412
Oh my gosh.

923
00:55:20,479 --> 00:55:22,047
Which makes total sense.

924
00:55:22,114 --> 00:55:24,083
The sediment in the lake
is limestone... it's alkaline.

925
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:27,219
That's how the massive spores
have been able to survive.

926
00:55:27,286 --> 00:55:28,720
There's zero acidity.

927
00:55:31,756 --> 00:55:34,126
This is it.
We found it.

928
00:55:35,827 --> 00:55:37,329
I wanna collect some more.

929
00:55:43,869 --> 00:55:45,237
You guys, we have
to keep moving.

930
00:55:45,304 --> 00:55:47,506
Yes, yes, of course,
of course.

931
00:55:47,573 --> 00:55:49,975
So, I'm having a thought.
Follow me through on this.

932
00:55:50,042 --> 00:55:53,678
I want to try to combine
the fungus and the acridum,

933
00:55:53,745 --> 00:55:55,648
make kind of a concoction.

934
00:55:55,713 --> 00:55:56,882
And douse my little
friends with it,

935
00:55:56,949 --> 00:55:58,417
essentially infecting them,

936
00:55:58,484 --> 00:56:00,752
then set them loose on
the rest of the swarm.

937
00:56:00,818 --> 00:56:02,288
- That's a great idea.
- Right?

938
00:56:02,354 --> 00:56:03,322
That should work.

939
00:56:03,389 --> 00:56:05,191
Bingo, bango, no more locusts.

940
00:56:45,064 --> 00:56:46,999
General!

941
00:56:47,066 --> 00:56:49,301
We just lost both birds carrying
our payload over the Atlantic!

942
00:56:53,439 --> 00:56:55,040
This road takes us
away from the river,

943
00:56:55,107 --> 00:56:56,475
but it should be faster.

944
00:56:56,542 --> 00:56:57,943
The base is just ahead.

945
00:57:00,879 --> 00:57:02,848
[radio static]

946
00:57:02,915 --> 00:57:05,117
Scavenger! Zeus!
Do you copy?

947
00:57:05,184 --> 00:57:06,485
Scavenger.

948
00:57:06,552 --> 00:57:08,320
We just lost both payloads!

949
00:57:08,387 --> 00:57:11,190
I repeat!
We just lost both payloads!

950
00:57:11,257 --> 00:57:14,326
- No!
- We've lost the payloads?

951
00:57:14,393 --> 00:57:16,262
Affirmative.

952
00:57:16,328 --> 00:57:18,697
We've already dispatched two
Chinooks with similar payloads,

953
00:57:18,763 --> 00:57:19,999
ETA three hours.

954
00:57:20,065 --> 00:57:22,668
We don't have
three hours, Major!

955
00:57:22,735 --> 00:57:25,137
Dr. Hughes, we can't get
that ordnance here any sooner.

956
00:57:25,204 --> 00:57:27,439
It's coming by helicopter off
a carrier out in the Atlantic.

957
00:57:27,506 --> 00:57:30,576
No! That won't do!
We have to do something now!

958
00:57:30,643 --> 00:57:32,278
Zeus, stand by.

959
00:57:32,344 --> 00:57:35,014
You said that that airfield has
helicopters and ordnance, right?

960
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,781
- Yes.
- Okay.

961
00:57:36,849 --> 00:57:38,617
Then we handle this right now!

962
00:57:38,684 --> 00:57:41,086
- Scavenger!
- Zeus. Scavenger.

963
00:57:41,153 --> 00:57:43,289
We're going to explore
possible options on our end.

964
00:57:43,355 --> 00:57:44,957
We'll keep you apprised.
Scavenger out.

965
00:57:45,024 --> 00:57:47,226
Okay, let's go.
And stay low.

966
00:57:47,293 --> 00:57:48,327
[rumble]

967
00:58:04,576 --> 00:58:06,512
Run!

968
00:58:16,355 --> 00:58:18,090
- Hey, you guys okay?
- Yep.

969
00:58:18,157 --> 00:58:19,892
I think we're safe.

970
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:21,260
That was close.

971
00:58:28,334 --> 00:58:31,036
Hm. There's no guarantee any
of these birds are operational,

972
00:58:31,103 --> 00:58:34,306
but there's a Bell Huey
and a Chinook.

973
00:58:34,373 --> 00:58:36,475
- Great.
- Wait. You can can fly helicopters?

974
00:58:36,542 --> 00:58:38,577
It won't be a smooth ride,
but we'll manage.

975
00:58:38,644 --> 00:58:41,146
She'll definitely struggle
to gain lift with this heat,

976
00:58:41,213 --> 00:58:44,183
providing I can find ordnance
big enough to do the job.

977
00:58:44,249 --> 00:58:46,085
If we can get that helicopter,

978
00:58:46,151 --> 00:58:48,187
I have some hygroscopic
flares in my bag.

979
00:58:48,253 --> 00:58:50,889
It might temporarily disperse
the warm clouds

980
00:58:50,956 --> 00:58:53,459
and give the helicopter
some lift.

981
00:58:53,525 --> 00:58:57,096
Hey, if I go up, I can
dispense more acridum.

982
00:58:57,162 --> 00:58:58,897
Keep the locust swarms
from choking up the engines

983
00:58:58,964 --> 00:59:01,166
so you guys can carry the bombs!

984
00:59:01,233 --> 00:59:03,936
Check out the Huey.
I'll take the Chinook.

985
00:59:04,002 --> 00:59:05,804
Copy that.

986
00:59:05,871 --> 00:59:07,506
Stay here.

987
00:59:07,573 --> 00:59:09,608
When the Lieutenant gives you
the signal,

988
00:59:09,675 --> 00:59:11,243
Dr. Rodney and Lenna, you move.

989
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:13,712
Get up in the air,
do what you need to do.

990
00:59:13,779 --> 00:59:15,814
Dr. Hughes, you're with me.

991
00:59:15,881 --> 00:59:17,182
We're gonna take the Chinook.

992
00:59:17,249 --> 00:59:19,485
And do what we need to do.

993
00:59:21,987 --> 00:59:23,622
Good luck.

994
00:59:42,908 --> 00:59:44,643
Come on.

995
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:46,011
Careful, careful.

996
00:59:46,078 --> 00:59:48,347
Come on, come on.

997
00:59:52,284 --> 00:59:53,919
[gunfire]

998
01:00:26,752 --> 01:00:29,188
[speaking Portuguese]

999
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:40,999
[thunder]

1000
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,474
[gunfire]

1001
01:01:24,944 --> 01:01:27,513
That should be enough
firepower to get the job done.

1002
01:01:27,579 --> 01:01:30,249
Okay, I'm gonna use that loader
to get the ordnance

1003
01:01:30,315 --> 01:01:31,316
loaded up on the Chinook.

1004
01:01:31,383 --> 01:01:33,352
Stay put this time.

1005
01:01:38,423 --> 01:01:40,659
[helicopter rotors spinning]

1006
01:01:41,995 --> 01:01:44,096
Come on, Dakota, come on.

1007
01:01:46,565 --> 01:01:47,599
Come on!

1008
01:01:50,602 --> 01:01:52,504
Dakota, come on!

1009
01:01:54,273 --> 01:01:55,942
We're in!
Go, go, go, go!

1010
01:01:56,009 --> 01:01:57,276
Hang on!

1011
01:01:57,342 --> 01:01:59,044
This is gonna be rough
with these winds!

1012
01:01:59,111 --> 01:02:00,812
Copy that!

1013
01:02:14,027 --> 01:02:15,561
Whoa!

1014
01:02:15,627 --> 01:02:16,996
Very rough, okay?

1015
01:02:17,062 --> 01:02:19,431
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

1016
01:02:32,144 --> 01:02:33,779
[gunfire]

1017
01:02:33,846 --> 01:02:35,581
Hang on!

1018
01:02:35,647 --> 01:02:37,749
We're gonna go down if we don't
do something about these bugs!

1019
01:02:37,816 --> 01:02:40,385
Ooh, ooh,
I'm gonna try out my concoction!

1020
01:02:40,452 --> 01:02:41,854
- Okay, sounds like a plan!
- I'm gonna try right now!

1021
01:02:41,921 --> 01:02:43,188
Okay.

1022
01:02:44,323 --> 01:02:45,324
When you get a chance,
hold open the door

1023
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:46,692
so I can drop the flare.

1024
01:02:46,758 --> 01:02:48,493
Yeah. Okay.
Just give me a second.

1025
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:52,999
Whoa!

1026
01:02:53,066 --> 01:02:54,299
These things are getting
in the turbines!

1027
01:02:54,366 --> 01:02:57,102
No time for this.
Give me your flare!

1028
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,538
Are you gonna put them together

1029
01:02:59,605 --> 01:03:00,940
and kill two birds
with one stone?

1030
01:03:01,007 --> 01:03:02,374
- Yep.
- That's genius.

1031
01:03:02,441 --> 01:03:03,675
It'll clear the skies
with the cloud seed

1032
01:03:03,742 --> 01:03:06,045
and it'll disperse
all the locusts!

1033
01:03:06,111 --> 01:03:07,080
That's the idea.

1034
01:03:07,145 --> 01:03:08,380
Okay, great.

1035
01:03:08,447 --> 01:03:09,481
Wait, how are
we gonna light that?

1036
01:03:09,548 --> 01:03:10,984
Same way as we did last time.

1037
01:03:11,050 --> 01:03:13,285
Yes, but the Lieutenant
is flying the helicopter!

1038
01:03:13,352 --> 01:03:15,687
- How is he gonna shoot?
- Good question.

1039
01:03:15,754 --> 01:03:17,289
Lieutenant, does this thing
have an autopilot function?

1040
01:03:17,356 --> 01:03:20,325
Negative!
This is Vietnam era equipment!

1041
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:26,899
Okay.
I guess I'll take the shot.

1042
01:03:26,966 --> 01:03:28,233
Do you know how to shoot?

1043
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:29,468
I used to go plinking
with my dad.

1044
01:03:29,534 --> 01:03:30,903
Okay.

1045
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:32,137
That was with his .22 and
my BB gun, but that's okay.

1046
01:03:32,204 --> 01:03:33,605
I'm gonna give it a shot.

1047
01:03:33,672 --> 01:03:35,707
Lieutenant, can I use
your rifle, please?

1048
01:03:35,774 --> 01:03:37,309
Take it!

1049
01:03:38,044 --> 01:03:38,978
Okay.

1050
01:03:39,045 --> 01:03:40,980
O-kay! That's a big boy.

1051
01:03:41,047 --> 01:03:42,581
Okay.

1052
01:03:42,648 --> 01:03:44,716
I need advice on how
to shoot a canister

1053
01:03:44,783 --> 01:03:46,251
out a moving helicopter into
a swarm of angry locusts

1054
01:03:46,318 --> 01:03:48,153
and lightning.

1055
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:49,187
Push the selector
button to "full"

1056
01:03:49,254 --> 01:03:50,722
and make sure you lead it.

1057
01:03:50,789 --> 01:03:52,691
Lead it, okay.
And when you say "lead it",

1058
01:03:52,758 --> 01:03:54,159
you mean with the barrel
in front of the target, right?

1059
01:03:54,226 --> 01:03:55,494
Affirmative!

1060
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:56,828
On full auto, you wanna
lead it by

1061
01:03:56,896 --> 01:03:58,397
about two feet below to be safe!

1062
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:00,066
On full auto, the rifle's
gonna tilt up

1063
01:04:00,133 --> 01:04:01,667
when you pull the trigger!

1064
01:04:01,733 --> 01:04:03,402
- Okay, sensible enough.
- Yeah, yeah.

1065
01:04:03,468 --> 01:04:05,071
Okay, here we go.
On three.

1066
01:04:05,138 --> 01:04:08,473
- Okay.
- One, two, three!

1067
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:09,574
[grunts]

1068
01:04:12,678 --> 01:04:14,279
Ah!

1069
01:04:15,081 --> 01:04:16,381
Oh!

1070
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:20,585
- I did it!
- You did it!

1071
01:04:20,652 --> 01:04:22,220
You did it!

1072
01:04:26,792 --> 01:04:29,661
It's not working.
Oh, it's not...

1073
01:04:29,728 --> 01:04:31,763
It's not working!

1074
01:04:35,734 --> 01:04:37,769
These things are getting
into the turbine engines!

1075
01:04:37,837 --> 01:04:40,706
I'm gonna have to put this
thing down before we crash!

1076
01:04:40,772 --> 01:04:42,041
Go, go, go!
Take it down! Take it down!

1077
01:04:42,108 --> 01:04:43,542
Go, go!

1078
01:04:45,577 --> 01:04:47,212
Whoa!

1079
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:52,784
Oh!

1080
01:04:57,389 --> 01:04:58,824
Lieutenant!

1081
01:05:07,066 --> 01:05:08,567
[grunts]

1082
01:05:09,634 --> 01:05:11,636
- Is everybody okay?
- Yeah.

1083
01:05:13,072 --> 01:05:15,240
What are we gonna do?

1084
01:05:15,307 --> 01:05:16,308
I don't know.

1085
01:05:16,374 --> 01:05:17,709
I don't understand.

1086
01:05:17,776 --> 01:05:19,946
The acridum didn't
kill these things.

1087
01:05:20,012 --> 01:05:23,015
Maybe the Hygroscopic aerosols

1088
01:05:23,082 --> 01:05:25,584
didn't... dampened the
effectiveness of the acridum?

1089
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:27,186
Of the acridum!
Yes, that's it!

1090
01:05:27,252 --> 01:05:28,687
Do you have another one?

1091
01:05:28,754 --> 01:05:29,956
I have one more.

1092
01:05:30,022 --> 01:05:33,893
The one that worked
the last time, so...

1093
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:36,162
Okay, okay.

1094
01:05:36,229 --> 01:05:37,230
Here.

1095
01:05:37,295 --> 01:05:38,730
Lieutenant?

1096
01:05:38,797 --> 01:05:41,700
Lieutenant, you take the shot.
You throw the canister.

1097
01:05:41,767 --> 01:05:43,535
- Okay. Copy.
- I'll open the door.

1098
01:05:43,602 --> 01:05:44,569
- We got this.
- Yeah.

1099
01:05:44,636 --> 01:05:48,473
Ready?
One, two, three!

1100
01:05:49,909 --> 01:05:51,043
[gunfire]

1101
01:05:57,682 --> 01:06:00,685
It's working?
It's working!

1102
01:06:00,752 --> 01:06:02,788
Hey!

1103
01:06:04,123 --> 01:06:06,691
Major Jones, the locust
swarms have been dispersed.

1104
01:06:06,758 --> 01:06:08,261
You are clear for takeoff.

1105
01:06:08,326 --> 01:06:09,761
Copy, Sergeant.

1106
01:06:09,828 --> 01:06:12,297
Dakota? Elliot? Thank you
for your work up there.

1107
01:06:12,364 --> 01:06:14,934
All right, here we go.
Hold on, Lynise.

1108
01:06:15,001 --> 01:06:16,601
I should be able to connect
to the satellite

1109
01:06:16,668 --> 01:06:18,204
using the Chinook systems.

1110
01:06:18,271 --> 01:06:19,704
I'm getting a signal!

1111
01:06:19,771 --> 01:06:21,807
It's weak, but it's
gonna get the job done!

1112
01:06:26,145 --> 01:06:27,412
Okay, I got the coordinates.

1113
01:06:27,479 --> 01:06:29,614
Go to the north shore
of the lake.

1114
01:06:29,681 --> 01:06:35,687
You're going to 10.7339 Sierra
by 37.5681 Whiskey.

1115
01:06:35,754 --> 01:06:38,690
Copy.
Adjusting accordingly.

1116
01:07:13,092 --> 01:07:14,459
The world is coming to an end.

1117
01:07:18,663 --> 01:07:20,933
Don't count our
team out just yet.

1118
01:07:21,901 --> 01:07:23,602
Yes, ma'am.

1119
01:07:33,712 --> 01:07:35,480
Major, are you all right?

1120
01:07:38,483 --> 01:07:40,353
Major, did you hear me?

1121
01:07:40,418 --> 01:07:43,155
I heard a voice.
Like thunder.

1122
01:07:44,891 --> 01:07:46,058
Major?

1123
01:07:47,226 --> 01:07:49,161
"Come", it cried out.

1124
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,937
Major!
Where are you taking us?

1125
01:07:58,004 --> 01:08:01,073
To Sergipe! We will open
the Seventh Seal, doctor!

1126
01:08:06,345 --> 01:08:10,049
Major! I need you to turn
the helicopter back around!

1127
01:08:16,621 --> 01:08:19,225
I saw before me
a white horse,

1128
01:08:19,292 --> 01:08:21,593
its rider armed with a bow,

1129
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:24,163
an adorning crown upon his head.

1130
01:08:26,564 --> 01:08:30,836
Behold the second horse...
fiery red!

1131
01:08:31,837 --> 01:08:34,773
Its rider armed
with a mighty sword

1132
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:37,043
to strike down my enemies.

1133
01:08:40,445 --> 01:08:43,581
Major, I've got
something for you.

1134
01:08:43,648 --> 01:08:45,151
The third horse!

1135
01:08:45,217 --> 01:08:46,584
A black one!

1136
01:08:46,651 --> 01:08:50,655
Its rider baring
the scales of justice...

1137
01:08:50,722 --> 01:08:53,591
Justice and punishment
to my enemies.

1138
01:08:53,658 --> 01:08:56,661
Major, please, take this,

1139
01:08:56,728 --> 01:08:58,831
it's going to make
you feel better.

1140
01:09:00,632 --> 01:09:02,534
Please.

1141
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:04,569
Behold.

1142
01:09:06,571 --> 01:09:09,774
A pale horse emerged...

1143
01:09:15,114 --> 01:09:19,085
And death was its rider.

1144
01:09:26,791 --> 01:09:29,161
And all hell followed!

1145
01:09:30,363 --> 01:09:32,098
[shouts]

1146
01:09:32,164 --> 01:09:37,069
Major! It's me!
It's Lynise! Please!

1147
01:09:41,407 --> 01:09:43,142
Major, please!

1148
01:09:43,209 --> 01:09:46,178
Don't worry, doctor.
No need to worry.

1149
01:09:46,245 --> 01:09:48,280
I'm pulling
the cold air out there.

1150
01:09:48,347 --> 01:09:52,284
Major, tell me about...

1151
01:09:52,351 --> 01:09:54,686
tell me about Joseph

1152
01:09:54,753 --> 01:09:57,689
when he finally revealed
himself to his brothers!

1153
01:10:02,128 --> 01:10:03,762
What did Joseph do?

1154
01:10:03,828 --> 01:10:05,331
After the terrible injustice

1155
01:10:05,398 --> 01:10:06,631
done to him by his brothers...

1156
01:10:06,698 --> 01:10:08,633
What did Joseph do?

1157
01:10:10,369 --> 01:10:12,138
What did he do?

1158
01:10:16,909 --> 01:10:19,845
He offered forgiveness...

1159
01:10:21,147 --> 01:10:23,648
Yes!

1160
01:10:23,715 --> 01:10:28,988
Genesis 50:20.

1161
01:10:29,055 --> 01:10:32,491
"You intended to cause me harm,

1162
01:10:32,557 --> 01:10:34,592
but God intended
it all for good."

1163
01:10:34,659 --> 01:10:36,162
[grunts]

1164
01:10:46,439 --> 01:10:48,941
I need you to breathe this in!

1165
01:10:49,008 --> 01:10:49,842
Breathe!

1166
01:10:49,909 --> 01:10:51,043
The oxygen will kill the fungus!

1167
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:52,011
Breathe!

1168
01:10:52,078 --> 01:10:55,481
No!
Breathe, please breathe!

1169
01:10:55,548 --> 01:10:57,816
There you go,
there you go.

1170
01:10:57,883 --> 01:11:01,020
There you go.
Keep breathing, keep breathing.

1171
01:11:04,323 --> 01:11:06,225
Good, Major, good.

1172
01:11:06,292 --> 01:11:07,625
Okay.

1173
01:11:08,394 --> 01:11:10,628
Now I need this.

1174
01:11:10,695 --> 01:11:12,630
Keep breathing, Major.

1175
01:11:15,935 --> 01:11:18,137
General, this is Lynise!

1176
01:11:19,472 --> 01:11:22,241
Dr. Hughes, where is the Major?
What's happening there?

1177
01:11:22,308 --> 01:11:24,076
The Major was infected
by the fungus.

1178
01:11:24,143 --> 01:11:25,610
I was able to clear
it out of his system

1179
01:11:25,677 --> 01:11:27,113
with the oxygen
from a respirator.

1180
01:11:27,179 --> 01:11:29,148
Listen, I don't have
time to explain all that.

1181
01:11:29,215 --> 01:11:31,484
Can you find us
on your satellite?

1182
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:33,486
We're in a Chinook helicopter.

1183
01:11:33,552 --> 01:11:39,925
Our coordinates are 10.7739
Sierra by 37.5861 Whiskey.

1184
01:11:39,992 --> 01:11:41,626
Are you over Lago Do Fodo?

1185
01:11:41,693 --> 01:11:42,928
Yes, yes.

1186
01:11:42,995 --> 01:11:44,796
We have a huge bomb
from the airport.

1187
01:11:44,864 --> 01:11:46,365
And we're gonna drop it
over the epicenter

1188
01:11:46,432 --> 01:11:48,800
because the ordnance isn't
gonna get here in time.

1189
01:11:48,868 --> 01:11:51,437
The Major has promised me
it's going to work.

1190
01:11:51,504 --> 01:11:54,073
But I still need you to use
the infrared satellite

1191
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:56,408
and guide us directly
over the epicenter.

1192
01:11:56,475 --> 01:11:57,510
Can you do that?

1193
01:11:57,576 --> 01:11:59,311
Absolutely.
Stand by.

1194
01:12:01,147 --> 01:12:02,281
Okay.

1195
01:12:05,050 --> 01:12:06,818
Let me get in there, doctor.

1196
01:12:06,886 --> 01:12:09,321
- Let me in there.
- Okay, okay.

1197
01:12:11,023 --> 01:12:14,659
The General is
gonna guide us

1198
01:12:14,726 --> 01:12:16,362
to the epicenter, okay?

1199
01:12:17,863 --> 01:12:19,265
Who's flying the helicopter?

1200
01:12:19,331 --> 01:12:20,866
The Major is now.

1201
01:12:20,933 --> 01:12:23,903
Good. Glad to hear that oxygen
is an effective antidote.

1202
01:12:23,969 --> 01:12:25,905
We have eyes on
the epicenter, Major.

1203
01:12:25,971 --> 01:12:29,241
I want you to take
a heading out in vector 4.7.

1204
01:12:29,308 --> 01:12:31,143
I've lost access
to my guidance systems.

1205
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:33,711
I'll need you to direct me
with landmarks, General.

1206
01:12:33,778 --> 01:12:35,347
Copy that.

1207
01:12:35,414 --> 01:12:38,517
I need you to reduce
your speed to 160 knots.

1208
01:12:38,584 --> 01:12:40,752
Target is to your 2:00.

1209
01:12:41,954 --> 01:12:44,290
Copy.
Adjusting coordinates.

1210
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:52,131
You're 55 meters on target.
Stay on that heading.

1211
01:12:54,799 --> 01:12:56,502
Gasses are rising
to the surface.

1212
01:12:56,569 --> 01:12:58,904
It's getting ready to
blow any minute now!

1213
01:12:58,971 --> 01:13:00,940
Okay. You're directly over
the epicenter.

1214
01:13:01,006 --> 01:13:02,441
Push yourself into
a holding pattern,

1215
01:13:02,508 --> 01:13:05,344
drop your ordnance
and get out of there!

1216
01:13:08,581 --> 01:13:11,483
Confirm holding pattern,
preparing to drop ordnance.

1217
01:13:11,550 --> 01:13:13,319
Engaging autopilot.

1218
01:13:16,388 --> 01:13:21,560
Doctor, there's a switch,
a release switch,

1219
01:13:21,627 --> 01:13:23,795
behind the door there.

1220
01:13:23,862 --> 01:13:27,366
Turn the top dial first

1221
01:13:27,433 --> 01:13:30,236
and the second dial after.

1222
01:13:30,302 --> 01:13:33,038
- That'll release the bomb.
- Okay.

1223
01:13:33,105 --> 01:13:34,273
Top.

1224
01:13:37,543 --> 01:13:39,744
First, and sec...

1225
01:13:41,513 --> 01:13:43,249
Um...

1226
01:13:46,652 --> 01:13:47,785
I'm sorry.

1227
01:13:47,853 --> 01:13:49,455
What? What happened?

1228
01:13:49,521 --> 01:13:52,424
Mechanical failure,
a loss of hydraulic pressure.

1229
01:13:52,491 --> 01:13:53,791
Okay, but what do we do?

1230
01:13:53,859 --> 01:13:56,695
Must be a leak.
There's nothing...

1231
01:13:56,761 --> 01:13:59,231
There's nothing to do, doctor.

1232
01:13:59,298 --> 01:14:00,132
It's over.

1233
01:14:00,199 --> 01:14:02,935
Well, can't we cut the cables?

1234
01:14:03,002 --> 01:14:05,337
You can't cut
those cables, doctor.

1235
01:14:05,404 --> 01:14:07,139
They're holding up an
8,000 kilogram bomb.

1236
01:14:07,206 --> 01:14:08,974
They're not made out of string.

1237
01:14:12,444 --> 01:14:14,213
What's happening, Major?

1238
01:14:16,781 --> 01:14:20,219
Sorry, doctor...
I'm not feeling well.

1239
01:14:27,393 --> 01:14:28,427
Okay.

1240
01:14:31,563 --> 01:14:32,797
Major?

1241
01:14:32,865 --> 01:14:35,134
Major?

1242
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:39,371
Major, I'm gonna crash
the helicopter into the lake.

1243
01:14:41,473 --> 01:14:43,175
There's no greater love

1244
01:14:43,242 --> 01:14:45,477
than to lay your life
down for your brother.

1245
01:14:46,445 --> 01:14:47,479
I like that.

1246
01:14:49,548 --> 01:14:52,718
General?
This is Lynise.

1247
01:14:52,785 --> 01:14:55,988
The other payload should be
there within three hours.

1248
01:14:56,055 --> 01:14:58,190
General, there is no time left.

1249
01:14:58,257 --> 01:15:00,225
Is there any way
to fix this lever?

1250
01:15:00,292 --> 01:15:02,728
It could be
several things, doctor.

1251
01:15:02,795 --> 01:15:06,465
He said it's something with the
hydraulics, loss of fluid maybe.

1252
01:15:06,532 --> 01:15:07,833
That can't be fixed.

1253
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:09,968
You need to have
the helicopter grounded.

1254
01:15:10,035 --> 01:15:11,503
I'm not going down
without a fight.

1255
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:13,706
We're gonna crash
the helicopter into the lake.

1256
01:15:13,772 --> 01:15:15,207
You're gonna what?

1257
01:15:15,274 --> 01:15:17,309
We're going to crash
the helicopter!

1258
01:15:17,376 --> 01:15:19,044
That won't work, doctor.
The firing mechanism won't...

1259
01:15:19,111 --> 01:15:21,914
The firing mechanism
is heat activated.

1260
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:24,183
Hold on!
Don't do anything rash!

1261
01:15:24,249 --> 01:15:25,918
As long as the helicopter makes
contact with the magma chamber,

1262
01:15:25,984 --> 01:15:27,953
the heat from the volcano
should be high enough

1263
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:29,788
to trigger the bomb.

1264
01:15:29,855 --> 01:15:32,091
It's our only option, General.

1265
01:15:39,598 --> 01:15:41,200
[alarm blaring]

1266
01:15:43,369 --> 01:15:48,240
Okay, Major, tell me about
one of your best memories,

1267
01:15:48,307 --> 01:15:50,342
maybe something about church?

1268
01:15:50,409 --> 01:15:52,544
My mom...

1269
01:15:52,611 --> 01:15:56,181
I used to love going to church
each Sunday with my mom.

1270
01:15:56,248 --> 01:15:57,851
Oh, good.
That sounds nice.

1271
01:15:57,916 --> 01:15:59,853
Tell me what it was like.

1272
01:15:59,952 --> 01:16:03,222
I had to
pass the collection plate.

1273
01:16:04,056 --> 01:16:05,591
I dropped it.

1274
01:16:05,657 --> 01:16:07,960
She said it was okay.

1275
01:16:09,128 --> 01:16:10,496
What happened then?

1276
01:16:10,562 --> 01:16:14,133
She went under the pews
to get the money.

1277
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,669
She told me it wasn't my fault.

1278
01:16:17,736 --> 01:16:20,639
Oh, that was so nice of her,
really nice of her.

1279
01:16:23,642 --> 01:16:25,144
Okay.
Okay, Major.

1280
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:28,447
Major, look, it's gonna
be all right, okay?

1281
01:16:28,514 --> 01:16:30,115
I got you.

1282
01:16:33,419 --> 01:16:34,453
Look!

1283
01:16:36,922 --> 01:16:38,524
We have to go get them!

1284
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:39,958
Will they even be alive because
of the volcanic fumes?

1285
01:16:40,025 --> 01:16:41,260
Isn't that water
extremely caustic?

1286
01:16:41,326 --> 01:16:43,595
No, no, no!
The lake is alkaline.

1287
01:16:43,662 --> 01:16:45,899
The limestone neutralizes
the volcanic acids.

1288
01:16:45,964 --> 01:16:47,933
There!

1289
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,368
Affirmative!

1290
01:16:49,435 --> 01:16:51,370
Scavenger, we have
two heat signatures.

1291
01:16:51,437 --> 01:16:53,105
It looks like they're
moving to

1292
01:16:53,172 --> 01:16:55,207
the north-eastern shoreline
headed straight for you!

1293
01:16:58,912 --> 01:17:00,412
Come on!

1294
01:17:00,479 --> 01:17:03,248
Hey, you guys, over here!
Help me get Oakley out!

1295
01:17:03,315 --> 01:17:04,683
I got you, Major, come on!

1296
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:07,486
Major, major, major,
come here, come here.

1297
01:17:08,888 --> 01:17:10,155
Come on!

1298
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:13,225
Come on, big guy!

1299
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:15,961
Hey, what happened to the bomb?

1300
01:17:16,028 --> 01:17:17,429
Why didn't it go off?

1301
01:17:17,496 --> 01:17:19,331
Come on.

1302
01:17:19,398 --> 01:17:21,868
That ordnance...
it has a supersonic

1303
01:17:21,935 --> 01:17:23,669
impact casing in the head.

1304
01:17:23,735 --> 01:17:25,304
It won't blow until it
reaches temperature

1305
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:26,705
from the heat inside
the magma chamber.

1306
01:17:26,772 --> 01:17:27,706
We have to get out of here!

1307
01:17:27,773 --> 01:17:30,108
- Let's go!
- Go, go!

1308
01:17:35,314 --> 01:17:36,916
We've got them, Zeus!

1309
01:17:36,982 --> 01:17:39,953
We have all thee guests and
Major Jones in possession!

1310
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,588
Get to safety now!

1311
01:18:11,951 --> 01:18:13,485
[coughing]

1312
01:18:18,590 --> 01:18:19,691
I can't breathe.

1313
01:18:19,758 --> 01:18:21,727
That's normal.

1314
01:18:21,793 --> 01:18:23,662
Ordinance sucks the oxygen
right out of your lungs

1315
01:18:23,729 --> 01:18:25,697
when you're this close
to detonation.

1316
01:18:27,633 --> 01:18:28,767
Did we do it?

1317
01:18:28,835 --> 01:18:30,068
I can't tell yet.

1318
01:18:39,745 --> 01:18:41,981
General, look.

1319
01:18:42,047 --> 01:18:43,282
The monitor!

1320
01:18:54,326 --> 01:18:55,627
It looks like it worked.

1321
01:18:57,696 --> 01:18:59,197
It looks like it worked!

1322
01:18:59,264 --> 01:19:00,934
Yes, it did, ma'am!

1323
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,634
[cheering]

1324
01:19:03,435 --> 01:19:05,170
Nice work, soldier.

1325
01:19:06,672 --> 01:19:08,073
Scavenger.

1326
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:09,474
Scavenger, do you read me?

1327
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:11,710
Please tell me you're okay.

1328
01:19:11,777 --> 01:19:13,579
Scavenger, come in.

1329
01:19:15,113 --> 01:19:16,582
Scavenger.

1330
01:19:16,648 --> 01:19:18,017
Oh, thank God.

1331
01:19:18,083 --> 01:19:20,519
I am looking at
feed all over the globe.

1332
01:19:20,586 --> 01:19:23,388
And it seems like
you stopped it!

1333
01:19:23,455 --> 01:19:25,324
Excellent news, Zeus.

1334
01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:27,559
I'd like to speak to
Dr. Hughes if I may.

1335
01:19:30,562 --> 01:19:33,398
General Norris...
I mean, Zeus.

1336
01:19:33,465 --> 01:19:35,400
No need for mil spec
talk, doctor.

1337
01:19:35,467 --> 01:19:37,769
This is a secured line.

1338
01:19:37,837 --> 01:19:39,438
We are getting satellite imagery

1339
01:19:39,504 --> 01:19:43,843
that shows the entire chain
reaction is shutting down.

1340
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:46,278
All right!

1341
01:19:46,345 --> 01:19:48,246
The storm systems
appear to be clearing.

1342
01:19:48,313 --> 01:19:50,315
The locust swarms appear
to be dropping off

1343
01:19:50,382 --> 01:19:52,517
at a substantial rate.

1344
01:19:52,584 --> 01:19:56,055
And it looks as though
the geothermal readings

1345
01:19:56,121 --> 01:19:58,223
are dropping rapidly
at Lago Do Fodo.

1346
01:19:58,290 --> 01:20:00,425
Great to hear that, General.

1347
01:20:00,492 --> 01:20:02,194
And what of the
infection you spoke of?

1348
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:03,829
Regarding the fungi?

1349
01:20:03,896 --> 01:20:06,565
General, I'm gonna let
Dr. Rodney fill you in on that.

1350
01:20:08,667 --> 01:20:13,772
Hello. Hi.
Elliot Rodney here.

1351
01:20:15,942 --> 01:20:17,709
It's our respiratory systems.

1352
01:20:17,776 --> 01:20:19,444
As soon as I get back
to my labs,

1353
01:20:19,511 --> 01:20:22,447
I can synthesize a compound
that we can release

1354
01:20:22,514 --> 01:20:25,584
in aerosol form so we can spread
it through the locust swarms.

1355
01:20:25,651 --> 01:20:27,854
It'll also spread
from human to human,

1356
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:30,422
neutralizing the neural
effect of the fungus.

1357
01:20:30,489 --> 01:20:33,425
Outstanding, Dr. Rodney,
outstanding.

1358
01:20:34,693 --> 01:20:37,295
You wanna say something?
We all did our part.

1359
01:20:38,563 --> 01:20:41,134
General, this is
Dakota Lenna speaking.

1360
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:42,835
Good to hear your voice,
Dr. Lenna.

1361
01:20:42,902 --> 01:20:44,636
The cloud seeding worked
exactly as planned.

1362
01:20:44,703 --> 01:20:47,472
With the immense rush of
cooler air from the atmosphere,

1363
01:20:47,539 --> 01:20:50,009
we'll soon be
stabilize weather systems

1364
01:20:50,076 --> 01:20:51,576
along the jet stream.

1365
01:20:51,643 --> 01:20:54,413
I'm watching it happen
via satellite as we speak.

1366
01:20:54,479 --> 01:20:57,416
Excellent work from all of you!
Thank you!

1367
01:20:57,482 --> 01:20:59,484
You've all done
the world a great service.

1368
01:20:59,551 --> 01:21:01,186
Just doing our job, ma'am.

1369
01:21:01,253 --> 01:21:03,355
[phone rings]

1370
01:21:03,422 --> 01:21:06,491
General, we're getting
calls from all over.

1371
01:21:06,558 --> 01:21:08,694
They want to speak
with you, ma'am.

1372
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:12,031
Everyone, I've got a few
people that I need to talk to.

1373
01:21:12,098 --> 01:21:14,000
We can converse a little later.

1374
01:21:14,067 --> 01:21:17,669
Copy that, Zeus.
Scavenger out.

1375
01:21:17,736 --> 01:21:21,273
You guys, we did it!
We did it!

1376
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:23,976
Let's not do it again.

1377
01:21:24,043 --> 01:21:27,212
- We did it!
- Good job!

1378
01:21:27,279 --> 01:21:29,448
[cheering]

1379
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:37,990
[shouts]

1380
01:21:38,057 --> 01:21:40,559
Yeah!

1381
01:21:43,196 --> 01:21:45,330
Come on.

1382
01:21:46,264 --> 01:21:50,368
Lynise, I owe you an apology.

1383
01:21:51,170 --> 01:21:52,939
No apology necessary, Major.

1384
01:21:53,005 --> 01:21:55,240
All is forgiven.

1385
01:21:55,307 --> 01:21:58,343
Thank you.
