at their own pace.

00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,569

to take a quick potty break

108
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,202

Venus is actually the morning star

122
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,448
since it precedes the sun in the sky,
but the Romans called it Lux Ferre.

Don't worry. I won't ask.

147

I'm sure I'll hear all about it
in one of our little weep sessions.

00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,684
would rather eat pussy
than fuck your sorry ass.

Don't mind them.

185
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,287
Their cocks make them stupid.

186
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,046
It's true. I saw it in a documentary.

187
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,402
It sucks all the blood
from their brains.

188
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,324
The bigger their dicks,
the dumber they get.

to women like that?

or whatever.

where everybody spoke poetry.

203

like that than pretend.

204
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,364

I mean, like, talking nice,

205

Oh, nothing. There's this guy at my work
who just wants to be friends.

209

Oh, yeah, he wants you to say hello
to his little friend.

- Yes.

watch him bleed out.

My parents got divorced
when I was seven.

And, you know, really.

261

Well, it was a big deal
when she met Ron.

262
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,565
You know, 'cause she'd been
so unhappy for so long

263
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,930
and now she was happy again
and everybody was, like, relieved.

264
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,249
And Ron was like this
big hero to everyone,

265
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,609
which I always thought was pretty shitty
when you think about it, you know?

266
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,324
So at first...

267
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,211
at first I didn't say anything,

268
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,489
like, when he started.

269
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,369
And, you know,
the weirdest thing about it

270
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,483
is that I still sometimes
think about it.

271
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,405
Like all twisted around and stuff.

272

273

And because of that,

274
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,607
because I didn't say
something right away,

275
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,286
like that meant that I liked
it or something.

276
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,562
I don't know. It's dumb or whatever.

277
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,166

I used to think about it.

Well, the stepdad Ron, he denied it.

282
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,451
that anything happened
in the first place, so...

283

with a guy who rapes her?

terrified that her mom's
gonna find out about group.

286

with the neighbor.

- Are you telling me that Marla's dead?
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

529
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,765
Stop fucking saying that
and tell me what happened.

530
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,645
Angela, I am sorry. I don't know.

531
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,320
I was contacted
by a police detective this afternoon.

532
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,211
He told me that Marla
had been found dead

533
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,842
and that he needed to come here
to speak to the group tonight.

534
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,288
- How did she die?
- I don't know.

535
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,124
I'm sorry, I don't know.

536
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,645
I know it's a terrible shock.

537
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,451
I think that we need
to be here for each other.

538
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,605
This is a safe place
where we can feel and react

539
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,047
and start the mourning process together.

This is Detective McDylan.

551
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,325
He's here from the police department.

552
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,881
Please sit down.

553
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,769
Ahem. Should I...

554
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,530
Yes, please.

555
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,331
Ahem. Uh, hi, everyone.

556
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,164
First of all, I really appreciate you

557
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,049
letting me come and talk
to the group tonight.

558
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,806
As most of you are already aware,

559
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,725
early this morning we did discover
the body of Miss Finch.

560
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,406
Now this is a homicide investigation.

561
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,564
I myself, I'm actually with SVU.

562
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,848
A special victims unit often assists...

563
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,367
I thought SVU dealt with rape crimes.

564
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,602
Well, we do deal with assaults, yes.

565
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,082
But SVU also assists
in homicide investigations

566
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,401
when there's issues of abuse.

567
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,085
Was she raped?

568
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,123
Oscar. You're Oscar Kosca, right?

569
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,489
My name is "Koza." Mr. Kosca.

570
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,291
Now, I don't mean to offend
you, Officer McDylan.

571
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,647
- It's Detective.
- Okay, Detective.

572
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,485
This is a sacred circle.

573
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,406
It's a place of trust and I don't think
it's an appropriate venue

574
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,762
for you to be doing your... your...

575
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,843
whatever the hell
it is that you're doing right now.

576
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,085
Oscar, Detective McDylan
is an invited guest.

577
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,523
Well, I most certainly
did not invite him here, Lynne.

578
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,205
And I would not have invited him here.

579
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,203
And I think it was a big mistake
for you to do so.

580
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,691
- Okay...
- I have the floor, sir.

581
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,763
- I have the floor.
- Okay, okay.

582
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,242
See? This is...
this is exactly what I was afraid of.

583
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,890
The police, they don't care about us.

584
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,451
They don't care about the victims.

585
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,045
These guys with their investigations.

586
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,168
All they want to do is document things.

587
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,448
They want to dot their Is
and cross their Ts.

588
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,364
You know, our friend is dead, sir.

589
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,443
And while you're doing
your stupid paperwork,

590
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,244
- a beautiful girl is dead.

It's okay. Um, look, guys,

all I'm trying to do here
is just figure out her whereabouts

in the past 48 hours.

597
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,923
So anything you can think of
that might be helpful,

598
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,805
I'd really appreciate it.

599
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,167
Just anything at all.

600
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,804
Okay, tell you what.

601
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,844
I'm gonna go get a cup of coffee and
I'm gonna hang around for a little bit,

602
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,321
and if you can think of anything,
please don't hesitate.

603
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,801
I'll be right over there, okay?

604
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,361

607
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,524
He's a bit high-strung.

608
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,728
Yeah, he seems that way.

609
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,247
His daughter was raped.

610
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,687
Then the guy who did it
got off on a technicality.

611
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,644
She killed herself.

612
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,842
So he's earned his distrust
of the police.

614
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,491
Can you tell me what happened to Marla?

615
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,002
- Um...
- She was a friend of mine.

616
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,722
I'm sorry for your loss.

617
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,283
- Maybe I can help you.
- Yes, absolutely.

618
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,404
If you can think of anything suspicious

619
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,530
or anybody who maybe had
any kind of problem with her.

620
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,126
- Anything at all.
- So she was definitely murdered?

621
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,681
Unfortunately, yeah. Yeah, she was.

622
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,604
Was she assaulted?

623
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,401
I can't really discuss
specifics of the case.

624
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,005
It was her ex-boyfriend, wasn't it?

625
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,282
Would you let me buy you
a decent cup of coffee somewhere?

626
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,768
Sure, yeah.

627
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,604

00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,683

Well, it doesn't make sense.

630
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,802

than to put herself at risk.

refuse to press charges
when their boyfriend or husband

635

smacked them around or worse.

636
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,842
And you're right, it doesn't make sense.

637
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,287
She was smarter than that,
I'm telling you.

638
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,928
She would not have put herself
in some kind of a situation

639
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,809
with somebody who could hurt...

640
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,731
What?

641
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,284
Hey, what is it?

642
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,528

you should tell me.

00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,845
You should tell me.

646

I think you want to tell me, so...

647
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,806
She was a strong girl. Hard.

648
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,802
You think maybe she was into weird shit,
like, I don't know, rough sex?

649
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,200
No, that's not what I'm saying.

650
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,408
Okay.

651
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,401
- You guys were close?
- Yeah.

652
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,085
I mean, I don't know.

653
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,925
I liked her.

654
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:40,289
But I only knew her a few weeks.

655
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,531
We used to come here.

656
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,768
She made me feel strong.

657
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,404
- What?
- Nothing, I just...

658
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,244
I see this stuff all the time.

659
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,528

the rock everyone leans on,
but at home...

661
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,524
No, she was strong.

662
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,085
She did not take any shit.

663
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,571
Except from her ex-boyfriend, right?

664
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,047
No, he attacked her and she left.

665
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,201
Yeah, the last time.

666
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,045
But there are a ton
of domestic abuse calls on her file.

667
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,884
And again, I didn't know your friend,

668
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,691
but, like I said, I see it all the time.

669
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,729
These guys, they have a way
of getting under a girl's skin

670
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,168
and they can't shake 'em.

I'd be very surprised if it wasn't him.

I'm sorry, I'm... I shouldn't...

674
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,205
I can't really discuss any details.
You understand?

675
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,404
Listen, thank you so much
for taking the time to talk to me.

676
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:51,201
I appreciate it, and I'm really
sorry about your friend, I am.

677
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,522
I will do everything I can
to bring her some justice.

678
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,210
I promise you.

What's the matter, sweetie?
She leave you for a real man?

Don't worry, I got what you need.

I don't know if she was weak
and just very good at hiding it

695
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,885
or if she was outmaneuvered.

696

That's an interesting choice of word.

697
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,080
What do you mean by that?

698
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,726
Just that maybe things
didn't go as she planned.

00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,611
Well, what do you think she had planned?

she was some fucking loser

He's fucking guilty.
You said so yourself.

714
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,603
Okay, okay, listen.
I'm really sorry, okay?

715

These things are complicated

716

and unfortunately the good guys
don't always get to win.

I'm not a lawyer. I'm not the DA.

719
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,602
So it's her own fault she was killed

720
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,808
because she was weak
or scared or stupid?

721

I don't know what happened. I don't.

722
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,244
I am truly sorry, okay?

723
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,169
I know there's nothing I can say
to make that any better.

I think he did it.

00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,045
Otherwise someone could just
point their finger at you

734
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,440
and send you to jail
because they feel like it.

735
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,204
- He's guilty.
- What do you want me to say?

- They didn't fucking prove it.
- You didn't fucking prove it.

He's not capable of something like that.

1053
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:31,047
Well, maybe you don't know
people as well as you think you do.

1054
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,402
He's got a history of making threats,
did you know that?

1055
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,928
The accused in his daughter's case,
the DA, the lead investigator.

1056
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,884
These are the kinds of threats
people remember, too.

1057
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:41,128
Did he actually do any of it?

1058
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,408
Has Oscar actually hurt anybody?

1059
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,528
I don't know. That's what
we're trying to figure out, okay?

1060
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,331
So if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna get back to my shitty job.

1061
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:59,247
(PHONE RINGING)

1062
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,768
Hey.

1063
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,161
You all right?

1064
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,644
Do you want to talk about it?

1065
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:22,450
Well, if you change your mind,
I'm a good listener.

1066
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,601
Thanks. It's all right.

1067
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,764
Okay.

1068
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,404
Oscar.

1069
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,125
What are you doing here?

1070
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,328
I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

1071
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,927
Do you have a few minutes?

1072
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,646
I read about your daughter's case.

1073
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,802
They really botched it.

1074
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,242
It's bureaucracy.

1075
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,091
All these functionaries

1076
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,163
who only know how to push paper around.

1077
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,846
When the facts don't match up
with the paperwork,

1078
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,162
they discount the facts.

1079
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:15,530
They "lost" his DNA,
so he didn't rape my daughter.

1080
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:17,449
Yeah.

1081
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:20,849
I bet his high-priced lawyer
paid someone to lose it.

1082
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:24,808
They couldn't move forward without it?

1083
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,442
No, without physical evidence,
it's her word against his.

1084
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:31,331
And they made her out to...

1085
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,444
to look like a slut.

1086
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:41,450
And it devastated her.
It just ruined her.

1087
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:45,844
And all this time, knowing this guy
Watson is still out there.

1088
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,644
Why are you suddenly so interested?

1089
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:53,650
Because I know how your daughter felt.

1090
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:56,366
Hopeless.

1091
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,083
One of the guys who raped me was a cop.

1092
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:10,566
You never talk in group.
You never say anything.

1093
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,927
There were five of them.

1094
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,042
I thought the sheriff would protect me.

1095
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,891
I was wrong.

1096
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,930
Were they caught?

1097
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:26,124
They weren't arrested,
if that's what you mean.

1098
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:32,449
(SCOFFS) You know, you tell your kids
to trust the authorities, right?

1099
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:35,046
Call 911, call the cops.

1100
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,921
Emma didn't want to do it.
I had to convince her to do it.

1101
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:40,889
I told her, "You've got to do this.

1102
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:44,010
You've got to report this guy.
He's just gonna do it to somebody else."

1103
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:47,084
But the day that this guy walked,

1104
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:51,211
I'll never forget the expression
on her face,

1105
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,641
the disappointment that she had in me.

1106
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:57,327
Not in the cops,
not in the lawyers, but in me.

1107
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,450
Because I told her to do it.

1108
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:01,840
I let her down.

1109
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,287
I think justice has a way
of finding people.

1110
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:07,523
Yeah, well, I've given up on justice.

1111
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:15,603
How did her rapist get
a restraining order against you?

1112
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,565
I thought if he saw my face

1113
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:22,081
that he wouldn't forget her.

1114
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:25,289
That maybe he would confess.

1115
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,842
He owned this gym.
That's where it happened.

1116
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,889
So I went there every day

1117
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,566
and I talked to everybody
who went in and out of that place

1118
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:36,485
and I wanted them to know what he did.

1119
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:37,687
So what does he do?

1120
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:42,447
He turns around and he sues me for libel
and gets a restraining order against me.

1121
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:46,161
He sold that gym,
but he's still a fucking trainer.

1122
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,482
Some sleazy place on 17th Street.

1123
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,722
They made it sound
like you were dangerous.

1124
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:53,082
(LAUGHS) Come on, look at me.

1125
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:56,449
Compared to Watson, that creature.

1126
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,568
But I should have done something.

1127
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:01,366
I should have done something
to make things right.

1128
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,841
Even if it meant me going
to jail for the rest of my life,

1129
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,002
I should have done something.

1130
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:11,689
DOCTOR: But you're not talking about
punishment, you're talking about vengeance.

1131
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,763
Taking the law into your own hands.

1132
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,048
I'd rather that
than leave it in nobody's,

1133
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,201
which is where it is now.

1134
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,084
You believe that?

1135
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,009
Don't you?

1136
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:24,329
Set aside for a moment
the countless rapists

1137
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:27,968
who go unpunished, what about
people like Cassie's mom?

1138
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:30,242
Serving her daughter up to a monster.

1139
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:31,561
She gets a big pass.

1140
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:33,529
She's not even in the system.

1141
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:35,409
Who's gonna make her pay
for what she did?

1142
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,050
That's not your job.

1143
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,567
Don't you think she's been affected
by her decisions?

1144
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,285
No. That's bullshit.

1145
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:43,363
I saw her and she looked fine to me.

1146
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:47,730
Everybody has their own problems,
their own destiny.

1147
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,929
You need to worry about
your choices and actions.

1148
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,242
I thought that was your job.

01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:56,726
You know what I'm hearing?

1151
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,484
Is that after everything
you've been through,

1152
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,961
you have essentially learned nothing.

1153
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,963
No.

1154
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:06,169
I've learned a lot.

What the fuck is this?

1172
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:18,048
Get your hands on
your fucking head right now.

1173
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,406
You following me?

1174
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,001
Hands on your head,
get on the ground now.

You all right? Yeah?

1185
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,290
- You up for a few questions?
- Sure.

01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:08,609
Great.

1187
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,683
Okay.

Let's see.

1189
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,566
- The knife was yours, right?
- Yes.

1190
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,449
The Taser I'm not sure about

1191
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,887
because it had your fingerprints
on it as well as his.

1192
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,889
It's mine. I was raped.

1193
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,969
Of course I don't go out
without defensive weapons.

1194
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:25,531
Naturally.

1195
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:29,002
And now, why were you
in that part of town?

1196
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:31,970
I was looking at a gym on 17th.

1197
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:33,884
On 17th.

1198
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:36,202
So you were eight blocks north of there.

1199
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:39,170
I got lost going home.

1200
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:41,004
Thought someone was following me.

1201
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,969
Guess I panicked.

1202
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,003
Why not a gym in your own neighborhood?

1203
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:49,050
Can't afford it.

1204
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,851
All right, well, the gym explains
the change of clothes.

1205
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,490
You found my bag, good.

1206
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:55,483
But not the lighter fluid.

1207
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:58,166
I was returning it.

1208
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,766
- To whom?
- The store.

1209
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:03,048
- It was the wrong kind.
- For what?

1210
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:06,409
A lighter. Started smoking again.

1211
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:07,686
It was used.

1212
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,531
I opened it before I realized.

1213
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:11,920
What store?

1214
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,684
Pharmacy on 15th.

1215
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,008
- Where was the receipt?
- In the bag.

1216
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,367
And the man? Who was he to you?

1217
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,602
The man who attacked me.

1218
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,524
Hmm.

1219
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:29,045
So who's the little girl in the picture?

1220
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:30,690
It's just a girl.

1221
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:34,162
Just a girl whose picture
you wear around your neck?

1222
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,966
It reminds me of something.

1223
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,248
Oh? What?

1224
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,050
Innocence.

1225
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:43,402
You need to be reminded of that?

1226
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,240
I know who she is.

1227
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,762
Chastity Storch.

1228
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:56,407
Her father was a Louisiana sheriff.

1229
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,130
Killed in a murder-suicide

1230
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:01,489
with some inbred redneck buddies of his.

1231
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:04,729
You know, there was one missing piece.

1232
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,087
Someone the police wanted to talk to.

1233
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:10,449
Jennifer Hills.

1234
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,769
Why'd you change your name?

1235
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:19,764
I didn't want to be
Jennifer Hills anymore.

1236
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:24,003
All right,

1237
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,567
let's just cut the shit, okay?

1238
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:29,769
We've got you, you understand?

1239
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:32,361
Do you understand?

1240
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:38,801
See, this, all this,
it's just a process.

1241
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,803
You know, the system.

1242
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,281
But it's done.

1243
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:46,887
We're not idiots, Ms. Hills.

1244
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:50,123
And, you know, it's actually
a very easy storyline to follow.

1245
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:53,443
You become buddy-buddy
with Marla Finch from group

1246
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,410
and, you know, yes, that was a terrible,

1247
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,324
terrible thing that happened to her.

1248
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:02,163
- Then the boyfriend walks and you snap.

1249
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:05,164
I understand that. I honestly do.

1250
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:09,609
And there are some days, whew,
I want to do the exact same thing.

1251
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:13,287
And then that girl, what was her name?

1252
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,083
Cassie. Jesus.

1253
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,925
I can't imagine
what it was like sitting there

1254
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:25,687
listening to that little girl
talk about being raped

1255
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:30,687
by her stepfather and not wanting
to shove a pipe up that guy's ass.

1256
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:34,970
That's actually what your buddy
Oscar suggested doing, right?

1257
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,600
That exact same thing, huh?

1258
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,366
- You know what?
- Hmm?

1259
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:43,046
Now that I think about it...

1260
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:48,241
Lynne seemed especially
upset about it all.

1261
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,050
Have you looked into her whereabouts?

1262
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:53,283
Yeah, well, we didn't find Lynne

1263
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:56,762
in a fight to the death
with Cole Watson.

1264
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:59,964
Who's Cole Watson?

1265
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,885
Man, don't kid yourself, Jennifer.

1266
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:06,203
We're looking at full-blown
premeditated murder.

1267
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:08,010
That guy attacked me.

1268
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:10,288
And if you hadn't shot him dead,
he would have killed me.

1269
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:13,364
I'm guessing they're not gonna
charge you because you're cops.

1270

(CHUCKLES)

1271
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:17,564
That's funny.

1272
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,722
You should hold on
to your sense of humor.

1273
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:21,530
You're gonna need it.

1274
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,569
Do I get a lawyer?

1275
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:27,520
Or is that just for people who you
haven't already decided are guilty?

- Jesus Christ.

1283
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,811
- No!
- I killed them all.

1284
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:53,883
- I did it.
- MCDYLAN: Call an ambulance.

1285
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:58,205
Call an ambulance now!

1286
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:01,483
I murdered them. I murdered them.

1287
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,642
I murdered them.

1288
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:20,450
Hey, Angela. I'll give you a ride.

1289
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,329
Go fuck yourself.

1290
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:25,165
- I'm sorry about Oscar, okay?
- I'm sure you are.

1291
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,448
Just let me give you a ride.
I'm trying to help you out here.

1292
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,284
Like you care!

1293
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,568
You fuckers are no better
than the rapists.

1294
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:32,721
Let me ask you something.

1295
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:35,201
Did you spend this much time
investigating Marla's ex?

1296
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,725
Or were you saving that all for me?

1297
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,724
Honestly, if I had any idea
how incompetent the police were,

1298
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:42,690
I would have spent my life
hiding in fear.

1299
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:46,566
Angela, don't leave town.

1300
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,687
I'm serious.
You skip bail, you're fucked.

1301
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,808
I'm fucked already.

1302
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,803
So are we gonna talk about it?

1303
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,764
What's there to talk about?

1304
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:00,885
Are you gonna tell me that you ran
into a door or fell down the stairs?

1305
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:02,690
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

1306
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,804

1307
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,530
Try me.

1308
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:13,686
The truth is you want justice,
you take it for yourself.

1309
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,968
No one can give it to you.

1310
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:17,690
Is that how that happened?

1311
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,444

to exact some justice,

but it doesn't seem to have
brought you any peace.

01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,404
let me just take you home.

I don't know... what is this?

freaking me out right now, okay?

Look, I'm gonna go.
You gonna be okay if I go?

to protect me?
