1
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:39,519
Noby!

2
00:00:40,978 --> 00:00:42,678
Over here!

3
00:00:44,396 --> 00:00:45,796
Shizuka!

4
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,217
- This is fun!
- Okay!

5
00:00:51,641 --> 00:00:53,641
Hurry!

6
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,840
Wait for me!

7
00:00:57,189 --> 00:01:02,956
Noby, wake up!
You won't have time for breakfast!

8
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:08,057
You'll be late for school!!

9
00:01:11,298 --> 00:01:13,298
A dream..

10
00:01:15,454 --> 00:01:19,821
<i> He went back to sleep.
He'll be late for school </i>

11
00:01:20,415 --> 00:01:23,615
<i>Noby! Wake up already!!</i>

12
00:01:28,717 --> 00:01:31,483
<i>Mom, Why didn't you wake me?!</i>

13
00:01:31,517 --> 00:01:33,784
<i> I tried many times. </i>

14
00:01:35,672 --> 00:01:37,239
I'm off!

15
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:44,159
I can still make it.

16
00:01:45,085 --> 00:01:47,085
<i> See? I knew it. </i>

17
00:01:47,183 --> 00:01:50,283
<i> Let's keep watching.</i>

18
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,130
We had steak 3 days in a row

19
00:01:54,756 --> 00:01:56,256
Noby...

20
00:01:56,405 --> 00:01:59,205
Stil standing in the hall?

21
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,945
How does it feel to be 
punished for being late?

22
00:02:05,246 --> 00:02:09,246
I wouldn't know.
I've never been punished.

23
00:02:11,744 --> 00:02:12,744
Yo, Sneech.

24
00:02:13,183 --> 00:02:16,483
Give him a break.

25
00:02:16,578 --> 00:02:21,678
He's been standing forever and he's tired.

26
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:23,292
Big G.

27
00:02:23,327 --> 00:02:25,927
You can play ball with us today.

28
00:02:26,148 --> 00:02:28,148
Be thankful.

29
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,180
I have another plans.

30
00:02:30,852 --> 00:02:34,452
What? Don't be so cocky.

31
00:02:35,525 --> 00:02:39,125
Stop it, you two!
You're hurting him.

32
00:02:41,184 --> 00:02:42,651
It's none of your business.

33
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:45,015
Don't talk to me like that.

34
00:02:45,447 --> 00:02:47,180
I'm fine, Shizuka.

35
00:02:47,556 --> 00:02:50,056
<i> He needs a girl's help. </i>

36
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:53,279
<i> He's more pathetic than I thought. </i>

37
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:55,639
Next! Noby!

38
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,020
Okay!

39
00:03:04,827 --> 00:03:07,360
Noby! Nice catch!

40
00:03:08,648 --> 00:03:14,948
- Let me try, big brother.
- Okay, just once, Little G.

41
00:03:15,032 --> 00:03:16,032
Thanks.

42
00:03:23,934 --> 00:03:26,334
<i> Pretty bad at sports. </i>

43
00:03:27,054 --> 00:03:28,054
<i> You're right. </i>

44
00:03:32,376 --> 00:03:34,776
<i> He's studying. Maybe he's smart. </i>

45
00:03:34,863 --> 00:03:35,863
<i> I don't know...see? </i>

46
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:42,266
<i>Something fell.</i>

47
00:03:42,403 --> 00:03:46,103
<i>Let's not do this.
It's no use going.</i>

48
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:48,281
<i>We have to do something.</i>

49
00:03:48,884 --> 00:03:52,651
<i>- We have to help him.
- Not possible!</i>

50
00:03:52,674 --> 00:03:55,874
<i>Let's go talk to great-great grandfather.</i>

51
00:03:58,052 --> 00:04:01,252
If not, I'm going to 
push the button on your nose.

52
00:04:02,187 --> 00:04:05,687
Okay, okay. Whatever you say.

53
00:04:24,342 --> 00:04:29,842
<font color="#00ffff">STAND BY ME</font> 
<font color="#0000ff"> DORAEMON</font>

54
00:04:47,443 --> 00:04:49,443
It's opening.

55
00:04:56,252 --> 00:05:00,252
Noby...You're Noby, right? 

56
00:05:17,808 --> 00:05:19,808
Aaaargghhh!!!

57
00:05:20,323 --> 00:05:23,623
- Seal!
- Don't be so rude!

58
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:28,731
But I can't blame you.
It's dark in here

59
00:05:34,996 --> 00:05:37,129
Good evening, I'm Doraemon.

60
00:05:38,592 --> 00:05:40,592
Aaaa......

61
00:05:41,788 --> 00:05:45,654
Let me come out.
Oh, a drawer?

62
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,550
Hi, I'm Soby.

63
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:53,008
Why were you in there?

64
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,360
Stay calm and listen.

65
00:05:55,997 --> 00:05:57,397
we're from the future.

66
00:06:06,903 --> 00:06:09,703
Wow, how does this work?

67
00:06:11,124 --> 00:06:13,924
Your things in the drawer are safe.

68
00:06:13,997 --> 00:06:17,297
They're in here in my Four-dimensional Pocket.

69
00:06:18,047 --> 00:06:20,647
I can fit anything in it.

70
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,847
Lots and lots of things.

71
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:36,592
Here you go.

72
00:06:36,606 --> 00:06:37,939
Thank you.

73
00:06:38,996 --> 00:06:43,696
In any case, I still don't understand.

74
00:06:45,308 --> 00:06:47,108
You're my descendants?

75
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,750
Your grandchild's grandchild.

76
00:06:49,794 --> 00:06:52,594
I come 4 generations after you.

77
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:57,833
I'm still a kid,
I don't have grandkids.

78
00:06:57,861 --> 00:06:59,961
Yummy!!!

79
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:02,921
What is this called?

80
00:07:04,993 --> 00:07:05,993
Yummy buns.

81
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:11,891
I've never had anything so good.

82
00:07:16,447 --> 00:07:20,847
Great-great grandpa, 
you'll be an adult one day, right?

83
00:07:21,345 --> 00:07:23,312
You'll get married, right?

84
00:07:23,407 --> 00:07:27,207
- I will?
- Yes. 19 years from now.

85
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:28,208
Really?

86
00:07:29,272 --> 00:07:31,472
Who am I gonna marry?

87
00:07:32,093 --> 00:07:36,926
Your wedding photo,
Her name is Little G. 

88
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:40,329
- Little G?
- Your life from then on.

89
00:07:42,775 --> 00:07:45,275
My wife...A bully like her...

90
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:49,832
You're lying! 
Go away! Go!

91
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:54,536
Get out of here!
I don't believe you!

92
00:07:56,835 --> 00:07:59,902
Don't get mad, okay?

93
00:08:01,265 --> 00:08:06,765
Unless things change,
your life is the pits.

94
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:08,836
Look at this.

95
00:08:09,182 --> 00:08:12,682
You can't find a job, 
so you start your own company.

96
00:08:13,691 --> 00:08:16,091
But, your office burns down in a fire.

97
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:20,859
Your debts from the fire snowball.

98
00:08:21,705 --> 00:08:26,105
That's why we're really poor.
All our things are old and shabby.

99
00:08:28,395 --> 00:08:29,395
Got it?

100
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,859
I'm sorry. 
I caused you guys so much trouble.

101
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,092
I wish I could dissapear.

102
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:49,021
Hey, don't get so down,
you can change your fate.

103
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:52,608
Really?

104
00:08:53,758 --> 00:08:57,558
That's why we're here.
Right, Doraemon?

105
00:08:58,148 --> 00:09:02,881
I still haven't said yes.

106
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,476
Hold on.

107
00:09:06,204 --> 00:09:09,071
Doaemon, we talked about this.

108
00:09:20,888 --> 00:09:24,588
Allright then. 
You're making me do this.

109
00:09:26,722 --> 00:09:31,322
Until you help Nobby be happy...

110
00:09:31,366 --> 00:09:35,866
....you can't come back to the future.

111
00:09:44,469 --> 00:09:45,803
You're so mean, Soby!

112
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:51,608
Doraemon will take care of you.
I'm quite busy.

113
00:09:52,786 --> 00:09:55,253
I can't! Impossible!

114
00:09:55,828 --> 00:10:01,128
It's programmed so you can 
come back once Nobby finds happiness.

115
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:02,171
Really?

116
00:10:03,307 --> 00:10:07,007
Even if you don't want to,
you'll have to come back.

117
00:10:07,854 --> 00:10:11,220
Of course I'll want to go back.

118
00:10:11,914 --> 00:10:14,848
I'm counting on you, Doraemon.

119
00:10:19,694 --> 00:10:21,628
He could be a bit difficult.

120
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:26,902
But I'm sure you'll 
be glad to have him around.

121
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:30,051
See ya!

122
00:10:37,257 --> 00:10:39,590
Thanks, Doraemon.

123
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:52,469
I can't do this,
I'm going back to the future.

124
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,160
Improper words detected.

125
00:11:01,031 --> 00:11:03,264
Okay, I get it!

126
00:11:04,134 --> 00:11:06,734
I'll help Noby find happiness.

127
00:11:09,592 --> 00:11:14,992
I can't believe Soby 
really activated the program.

128
00:11:16,503 --> 00:11:18,303
I hope I'm not hurt.

129
00:11:22,008 --> 00:11:24,342
Can you really help me?

130
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:29,243
I'll show you how 
amazing the 22nd century is!!

131
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:32,810
Hopter!

132
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,107
- What is it?
- Don't worry.

133
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:43,872
What does it do?
Go out the window?

134
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,019
You'll enjoy it.

135
00:11:50,455 --> 00:11:51,655
Aaaaarrrrggghhh!!!

136
00:12:01,695 --> 00:12:03,695
I'm floating!

137
00:12:04,753 --> 00:12:06,353
Cool, right?

138
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:10,844
It hurts. I'm not dreaming.

139
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:25,508
Help!
I'm gonna fly off into the space!

140
00:12:25,539 --> 00:12:30,239
Calm down! Calm down!

141
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,583
Stop! Stop! Stop!

142
00:12:33,572 --> 00:12:35,072
It stopped.

143
00:12:35,107 --> 00:12:36,107
Noby!

144
00:12:36,657 --> 00:12:37,724
Start working!

145
00:12:37,783 --> 00:12:39,583
Start working! Please!

146
00:12:46,127 --> 00:12:48,327
Noby! Wait!

147
00:12:55,998 --> 00:12:58,598
I can't swim!

148
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,683
You're getting the hang of it.

149
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:39,607
This is easy once you get used of it.

150
00:13:44,304 --> 00:13:48,404
Even little kids can used it.

151
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:04,949
What is it?

152
00:14:05,474 --> 00:14:06,474
Shizuka's house.

153
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:12,080
- A friend?
- Yeah, classmate.

154
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,932
Let's go surprice her.

155
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:18,443
Is she still up?

156
00:14:23,088 --> 00:14:26,321
She's sleeping. Too bad.

157
00:14:31,512 --> 00:14:34,312
She's pretty.

158
00:14:35,371 --> 00:14:39,204
You think so?
Even in future standards?

159
00:14:39,268 --> 00:14:44,068
Really? I see, I see.

160
00:14:44,221 --> 00:14:45,487
I totaly like...

161
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,039
What?

162
00:14:53,195 --> 00:14:56,928
Noby, you're still up? 
Go to sleep.

163
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,626
What did you just say?

164
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:06,508
Me and Shizuka...We're getting...

165
00:15:08,251 --> 00:15:09,251
Married?

166
00:15:09,746 --> 00:15:11,746
I wanna get back to the future.

167
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:16,902
I think it's the 
surest way to make you happy.

168
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,647
Me? Marry Shizuka?
I feel awkward.

169
00:15:23,777 --> 00:15:29,777
You don't have 
to go through all the trouble...

170
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,113
So you don't want my help?

171
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,839
Yes, I do.

172
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,080
But how?

173
00:15:41,636 --> 00:15:44,136
I'm go to school!

174
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:49,329
Doraemon?

175
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,466
No more being late for school.

176
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:55,079
Anywhere Door!

177
00:15:56,984 --> 00:15:58,051
What's that?

178
00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:01,805
Say where you want 
to go and open the door.

179
00:16:02,231 --> 00:16:03,231
School!

180
00:16:06,885 --> 00:16:08,885
I got a new toy yesterday.

181
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:13,329
Good morning.

182
00:16:15,992 --> 00:16:17,392
Noby's early. Unbelievable.

183
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,314
Shizuka...

184
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:27,689
Hi, Noby.

185
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:32,789
Godd morning.
You're early today.

186
00:16:34,675 --> 00:16:35,975
Memory Bread!

187
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:39,953
Eat it and you can 
memorize what's written on it.

188
00:16:41,346 --> 00:16:44,146
Here! Here! Here!

189
00:16:46,617 --> 00:16:48,617
I know the answers!

190
00:16:49,103 --> 00:16:52,603
You got better score than me!

191
00:16:52,952 --> 00:16:57,852
Doraemon, I wanna beat Big G!

192
00:16:58,586 --> 00:17:00,720
Invinsible Cape!

193
00:17:01,326 --> 00:17:03,892
Mom! I'm hungry!

194
00:17:07,505 --> 00:17:10,472
Hey! Who's doing that?!

195
00:17:11,134 --> 00:17:12,467
Ouch! My boil!

196
00:17:13,334 --> 00:17:15,034
Grabber Glove!

197
00:17:16,307 --> 00:17:19,407
Being good at sports 
can make you popular.

198
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:27,270
I caught it!

199
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:29,464
Nice catch!

200
00:17:33,572 --> 00:17:37,772
I saw that! Mr. S!

201
00:17:37,946 --> 00:17:40,046
Doraemon!

202
00:17:40,572 --> 00:17:43,172
Time Kerchief!

203
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:49,019
Things go back to the way they were.
You can also fast forward them.

204
00:17:51,512 --> 00:17:53,712
You shouldn't lie like that.

205
00:17:53,763 --> 00:17:54,763
Weird!

206
00:17:55,848 --> 00:17:58,981
Shizuka, what are you drawing? 

207
00:18:01,968 --> 00:18:03,668
Doraemon!

208
00:18:04,507 --> 00:18:06,374
Instan Wardrobe Cam!

209
00:18:06,998 --> 00:18:09,465
Draw an outfit.

210
00:18:10,431 --> 00:18:11,798
Sketchbook, please?

211
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:14,519
- Make it cute.
- You got it.

212
00:18:16,535 --> 00:18:18,135
Say cheese!

213
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:23,299
You pervert!

214
00:18:24,152 --> 00:18:26,952
Speedwinder!

215
00:18:26,993 --> 00:18:32,993
Put this on and it'll speed you up.

216
00:18:34,584 --> 00:18:39,384
You sure are working hard today.
Doraemon is helping, isn't he?

217
00:18:39,445 --> 00:18:42,045
- I'm finished!
- You are?

218
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:44,896
Helping your mom?
Good for you.

219
00:18:46,044 --> 00:18:48,477
Will you clean the living room now?

220
00:18:48,596 --> 00:18:49,596
Okay!

221
00:18:51,526 --> 00:18:53,526
Gulliver Tunnel!

222
00:18:55,644 --> 00:18:57,444
So big!

223
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,470
Yippee!!!

224
00:19:05,105 --> 00:19:07,405
Underground Treehouse!

225
00:19:12,177 --> 00:19:13,877
Extra Hot Cloud Spray!

226
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:24,436
Shizuka! Good morning!

227
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:27,029
Good Morning, Noby!

228
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:31,116
You're on a roll these days.
Thanks to Doraemon?

229
00:19:31,174 --> 00:19:36,074
Yeah. I feel like I can do anything.

230
00:19:37,014 --> 00:19:39,647
Shizuka! Can I talk to you?

231
00:19:39,689 --> 00:19:40,689
Sure.

232
00:19:44,954 --> 00:19:48,054
Oh yeah! I forgot about him.

233
00:19:48,946 --> 00:19:52,913
Good at sports. Good at school work.

234
00:19:53,528 --> 00:19:57,228
And a really nice guy.
My classmate Ace... 

235
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:02,070
Hey, Noby. You're early again.

236
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:11,808
You're saying no matter how much 
you use gadgets of the future...

237
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:16,939
...you can't beat your classmate Ace .

238
00:20:19,145 --> 00:20:20,645
Don't underistimate me!

239
00:20:20,741 --> 00:20:23,441
I'm a cat-shaped robot from 22nd century.

240
00:20:23,452 --> 00:20:25,652
There's nothing I can't do!

241
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:30,139
Hang on. I'll find 
a gadget that will make Shizuka...

242
00:20:30,143 --> 00:20:32,143
...fall in love with you.

243
00:20:34,594 --> 00:20:36,194
Imprinting Egg!

244
00:20:37,588 --> 00:20:38,588
What's this?

245
00:20:39,563 --> 00:20:41,963
Know about imprinting?

246
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:46,909
I guess you wouldn't.

247
00:20:47,716 --> 00:20:52,116
Some animals, especially birds 
treat the first thing they...

248
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:55,763
...see as their parent.

249
00:20:55,994 --> 00:21:00,694
Even a toy bird.

250
00:21:00,741 --> 00:21:03,241
This is called imprinting.

251
00:21:03,338 --> 00:21:04,838
Do you understand?

252
00:21:10,012 --> 00:21:11,679
You have no brains.

253
00:21:12,382 --> 00:21:17,749
Putting it simply,
get Shizuka this egg.

254
00:21:17,797 --> 00:21:22,097
Close it and a timer will start.

255
00:21:22,184 --> 00:21:28,184
15 minutes later, she'll fall 
in love with the person she sees.

256
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,900
Why you didn't tell me in the beginning?

257
00:21:32,977 --> 00:21:35,044
What an amazing gadget.

258
00:21:37,143 --> 00:21:41,677
Shizuka's heart will be mine.

259
00:21:42,805 --> 00:21:47,005
This gadget is very powerful.

260
00:21:47,357 --> 00:21:50,857
It has complete control over its subjects.

261
00:21:50,914 --> 00:21:54,714
Me, I wouldn't use such a cowardly gadget.

262
00:21:56,659 --> 00:22:01,459
No, Noby. Wait!

263
00:22:03,077 --> 00:22:06,077
Boy, it's heavy.

264
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,628
Stop!

265
00:22:11,722 --> 00:22:14,089
Big G! Stop it!

266
00:22:30,008 --> 00:22:32,141
Are you okay?

267
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:36,425
He's in the egg, which means..

268
00:22:38,158 --> 00:22:40,958
Noby honey..

269
00:22:45,373 --> 00:22:47,773
Go! Go!

270
00:22:49,479 --> 00:22:51,546
What's this?

271
00:22:52,576 --> 00:22:55,776
Hi Big G, what are you doing?

272
00:23:00,788 --> 00:23:03,855
That was expensive, you know?

273
00:23:05,459 --> 00:23:07,159
You're so cute!

274
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:10,684
You just noticed?

275
00:23:11,927 --> 00:23:17,294
I just got this. It's crushed

276
00:23:17,351 --> 00:23:21,951
Sneech! I'll never let you go again!

277
00:23:21,954 --> 00:23:23,954
Okay?

278
00:23:25,756 --> 00:23:27,856
Help me!

279
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,215
Why you running?

280
00:23:32,614 --> 00:23:34,947
Holy cow, that's strong.

281
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:37,046
Phew, that was close.

282
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:42,284
I don't think you should use it.

283
00:23:42,536 --> 00:23:43,536
Why not?

284
00:23:44,036 --> 00:23:47,369
You saw what happened.
It's a bad idea.

285
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:50,192
I wanna be popular too.

286
00:23:52,672 --> 00:23:55,239
Are you sure about this?

287
00:23:55,329 --> 00:23:56,329
Yes.

288
00:23:57,362 --> 00:23:59,162
Let's have Shizuka enter it here.

289
00:23:59,173 --> 00:24:01,173
How?

290
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:03,806
- See you.
- Yeah, see you.

291
00:24:09,552 --> 00:24:10,552
Yes, Doraemon!

292
00:24:11,291 --> 00:24:15,758
- What's that hole?
- Anywhere Hole!

293
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,260
It's connected to Shizuka's front door.

294
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:24,720
That's great! 
Now we wait for 15 minutes, right?

295
00:24:24,848 --> 00:24:25,848
Go on and get out of here.

296
00:24:26,444 --> 00:24:31,044
I don't want her 
to see you by mistake.

297
00:24:36,313 --> 00:24:41,713
I can hardly wait for 15 minutes.
When she comes out...

298
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:44,489
Hey, Noby!

299
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:47,166
Now what?

300
00:24:51,936 --> 00:24:54,769
That weird egg! It's Doraemon's, right?

301
00:24:54,873 --> 00:24:58,373
I need help! Do something!

302
00:24:58,492 --> 00:25:00,692
I'm busy right now.

303
00:25:00,803 --> 00:25:03,703
Big G right around the corner.

304
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:06,771
Sunie-poo! Where are you?

305
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:13,030
He's here! Move!

306
00:25:13,394 --> 00:25:14,994
Oh, I forgot!

307
00:25:15,093 --> 00:25:17,193
Shizuka!

308
00:25:21,199 --> 00:25:22,866
Go get Doraemon!

309
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:28,463
- Where is he?
- Go find him.

310
00:25:32,693 --> 00:25:35,393
There you are, Sunie-poo!

311
00:25:38,032 --> 00:25:41,232
You're my everything!

312
00:25:42,322 --> 00:25:44,022
Help! Mommy!

313
00:25:45,355 --> 00:25:50,055
Shizuka!

314
00:25:51,632 --> 00:25:55,165
Noby, What's going on?

315
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,919
How could you let this happen?

316
00:26:05,303 --> 00:26:07,803
I told you it was a bad idea.

317
00:26:07,927 --> 00:26:09,927
Please! You have to put her back!

318
00:26:11,315 --> 00:26:16,015
What? This will fix her but...

319
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:18,579
Ace?

320
00:26:20,297 --> 00:26:22,297
Don't you like me?

321
00:26:22,635 --> 00:26:24,535
Of course I do.

322
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:27,717
I like you a lot too.

323
00:26:28,784 --> 00:26:33,651
But I don't want to rely on a gadget.

324
00:26:42,446 --> 00:26:44,846
He won't use a gadget...

325
00:26:47,687 --> 00:26:53,654
I like you even more than before.

326
00:26:53,702 --> 00:26:55,402
Ace..

327
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,427
He's impressive.

328
00:27:04,466 --> 00:27:05,799
He's just too perfect.

329
00:27:07,012 --> 00:27:09,612
But me, on the other hand...

330
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:19,291
You're klutzy and slow 
and you hate to study.

331
00:27:19,369 --> 00:27:20,369
Shut up.

332
00:27:20,865 --> 00:27:23,732
- Timid, lazy, dense.
- Leave me alone.

333
00:27:23,762 --> 00:27:25,962
Bad at sports and a coward.

334
00:27:26,015 --> 00:27:28,015
Forgetful, unreliable, goof-off..

335
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:38,718
You're so lame that 
you can't be compared to Ace.

336
00:27:40,677 --> 00:27:42,210
You don't have to be so mean.

337
00:27:42,983 --> 00:27:47,316
Now you know you can't 
make the gadgets do all the work.

338
00:27:47,392 --> 00:27:49,392
You yourself also have to make effort .

339
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,400
Me, huh?

340
00:27:58,254 --> 00:28:02,121
- Galaxy!
- Whoa! But that's...

341
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:08,359
I'm not good at anything.

342
00:28:10,307 --> 00:28:14,607
If you don't at least try, 
you'll never change.

343
00:28:15,237 --> 00:28:17,570
You're okay with that?

344
00:28:25,198 --> 00:28:26,798
Good night.

345
00:28:41,412 --> 00:28:43,412
110 times 6 is...

346
00:28:47,036 --> 00:28:51,369
660. Yes! I'm right.

347
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:59,064
Next. 120 divided by 6...
This is hard.

348
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:03,864
What's going on?
Studying so early in the morning.

349
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:08,887
Did I wake you? Sorry.

350
00:29:09,544 --> 00:29:11,544
I thought about it.

351
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:17,170
I'm gonna try not to 
get a zero on my next test.

352
00:29:24,862 --> 00:29:28,362
Mom gave me more allowance today.

353
00:29:28,381 --> 00:29:30,881
Look. Noby's studying.

354
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:36,669
Wow! I'm so impresses Noby!

355
00:29:37,214 --> 00:29:38,114
38.

356
00:29:38,152 --> 00:29:40,052
- 120 divided by 3.
- 40.

357
00:29:40,185 --> 00:29:42,085
- 13 x 5.
- 65.

358
00:29:42,212 --> 00:29:44,412
- 25 x 3.
- 75.

359
00:29:44,486 --> 00:29:46,686
800.

360
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:58,939
Good luck on your test tomorrow.
I'm sure you'll do great.

361
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:12,170
There you are.

362
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:14,499
Here, Sneech.

363
00:30:15,044 --> 00:30:18,644
You're acting so weird, Noby.

364
00:30:19,422 --> 00:30:22,689
I'm not the guy I used to be.

365
00:30:23,249 --> 00:30:27,149
You better not get a good score.

366
00:30:28,052 --> 00:30:31,985
Then I'll apologize right now. Sorry.

367
00:30:32,425 --> 00:30:34,225
Okay, Start.

368
00:30:39,426 --> 00:30:41,226
Oh my God! No!

369
00:30:46,273 --> 00:30:49,906
Noby, you got a zero.

370
00:30:50,756 --> 00:30:55,156
- Again?
- I'm sorry.

371
00:30:55,506 --> 00:30:59,273
At this rate, you'll flunk elementary school.

372
00:30:59,367 --> 00:31:02,767
I'm worried about your future.

373
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:07,062
I'm so reassuring to 
have Noby in the same class.

374
00:31:08,259 --> 00:31:11,992
Don't be so smug.
You only got 10 points

375
00:31:12,301 --> 00:31:14,368
It's not that different.

376
00:31:17,555 --> 00:31:20,455
Noby!

377
00:31:22,103 --> 00:31:24,936
- How was the test?
- Don't ask.

378
00:31:25,014 --> 00:31:30,014
Come on. You studied so hard.
I bet you did well.

379
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,788
I'm not telling you.

380
00:31:32,256 --> 00:31:33,956
Don't be so shy.

381
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:35,739
Allright. Bring-It-Bag!

382
00:31:37,995 --> 00:31:43,062
I'll just fetch 
the test paper from Noby's bag.

383
00:31:43,634 --> 00:31:47,034
What? Japanese Test?

384
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:50,641
You were studying for a math test.

385
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:58,181
I can't stand this!

386
00:31:58,676 --> 00:32:01,709
I can't stand myself anymore!

387
00:32:01,781 --> 00:32:03,681
Noby...

388
00:32:03,681 --> 00:32:05,981
Leave me alone.

389
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:14,057
Be careful when you run!

390
00:32:14,469 --> 00:32:17,869
See what I mean?
Are you okay?

391
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,970
Come on, sweetie.

392
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,220
I made up my mind.

393
00:32:36,013 --> 00:32:38,313
Hi, Noby.
What are you doing?

394
00:32:43,566 --> 00:32:45,466
He's being weird.

395
00:32:46,352 --> 00:32:49,852
- Mom, I need a favor.
- I'm not buying you anything.

396
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:54,350
It's nothing like that.
Let's move somewhere far away.

397
00:32:54,378 --> 00:32:58,845
Don't be silly.
Why do we have to move?

398
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:03,500
Then let me go study abroad. 
How about the U.S.?

399
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:07,699
Stop talking nonsense 
or you'll be in trouble.

400
00:33:11,192 --> 00:33:15,759
I'll just have to take 
matters into my own hands.

401
00:33:16,386 --> 00:33:21,919
Noby, you tried really hard.
Don't worry about failing.

402
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:26,180
If other people can do it,
so can you.

403
00:33:26,252 --> 00:33:27,752
Here it is.

404
00:33:27,947 --> 00:33:30,147
Are you listening to me?

405
00:33:33,956 --> 00:33:36,856
It doesn't matter anymore.

406
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,080
I'm giving up on marrying Shizuka.

407
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:44,703
Why?
You don't like her anymore?

408
00:33:45,046 --> 00:33:48,046
Yes I do!
I like her a lot!

409
00:33:49,409 --> 00:33:53,509
She's everything to me.

410
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:57,484
Then why?

411
00:33:57,751 --> 00:34:00,251
I thought hard about it?

412
00:34:00,307 --> 00:34:05,807
If she marries me,
She'll be unhappy forever.

413
00:34:07,661 --> 00:34:12,394
Until now, 
I only thought about myself.

414
00:34:12,452 --> 00:34:18,452
But If I really do care about Shizuka...

415
00:34:18,509 --> 00:34:21,009
...she's better of without me.

416
00:34:23,886 --> 00:34:28,486
It's hard saying goodbye. But....

417
00:34:29,127 --> 00:34:34,427
It's harder thinking that
I'll be making her unhappy.

418
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,706
Shizuka! Nobiy is here!

419
00:34:41,222 --> 00:34:42,422
I'm taking a bath.

420
00:34:42,798 --> 00:34:46,798
I just came to return some books.

421
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:52,767
I'll always be wishing 
for Shizuka's happiness.

422
00:34:55,483 --> 00:34:59,950
Tell her I said goodbye.

423
00:35:00,288 --> 00:35:01,988
Noby?

424
00:35:12,292 --> 00:35:14,625
I'm doing the right thing.

425
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,020
Noby!

426
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:27,689
What's the matter?
Are you angry at me?

427
00:35:27,765 --> 00:35:28,765
Don't ask.

428
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:32,110
We better not see each other anymore.

429
00:35:32,226 --> 00:35:35,426
I won't leave until you say why.

430
00:35:35,472 --> 00:35:38,672
What am I supposed to do?!

431
00:35:40,811 --> 00:35:42,811
I'll make her hate me.

432
00:35:53,538 --> 00:35:55,338
Jerk!

433
00:35:57,257 --> 00:35:59,424
I hate you.

434
00:36:02,806 --> 00:36:06,439
He's really serious.

435
00:36:06,467 --> 00:36:09,367
I can't believe he did that.

436
00:36:17,081 --> 00:36:20,814
I'm doing the right thing.
But it's tough.

437
00:36:22,545 --> 00:36:25,045
Noby, what are you doing?

438
00:36:26,419 --> 00:36:29,819
Ace! You're a good guy.

439
00:36:29,836 --> 00:36:32,536
Take good care of Shizuka.

440
00:36:40,622 --> 00:36:46,322
Nobiy, want a yummy bun?
These are especially good.

441
00:36:46,378 --> 00:36:48,378
No! I'm not in the mood.

442
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,857
- Just a bite.
- I'm not like you.

443
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:52,950
Just eat it!

444
00:36:53,488 --> 00:36:55,888
I said, I don't want it!

445
00:36:55,966 --> 00:36:58,666
I don't usually share my yummy buns!

446
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:02,840
Noby's acting real weird.

447
00:37:03,151 --> 00:37:05,351
I agree.

448
00:37:05,677 --> 00:37:09,544
Noby's really depressed about 
getting a zero on that test.

449
00:37:10,279 --> 00:37:11,446
I would be too.

450
00:37:11,565 --> 00:37:14,065
If Mr. S told me I might flunk..

451
00:37:15,687 --> 00:37:19,720
...I'd be hating life.

452
00:37:19,729 --> 00:37:23,829
<i> Tell her I said goodbye.</i>

453
00:37:24,473 --> 00:37:25,473
Oh, no.

454
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:32,051
- Noby!
- It's Shizuka!

455
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:35,925
- I know you're there!
- Yikes!!

456
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,762
- Come here
- What should I do?

457
00:37:38,804 --> 00:37:42,504
- Noby!
- I have to make her hate me.

458
00:37:42,529 --> 00:37:44,329
Don't be stupid.

459
00:37:44,338 --> 00:37:47,638
That would put me 
in a tight spot as well.

460
00:37:47,709 --> 00:37:50,209
Just do something!

461
00:37:52,476 --> 00:37:55,743
- If you insist...
- Hurry up!!

462
00:37:55,812 --> 00:37:59,312
Despica-portion!
This should do it.

463
00:37:59,408 --> 00:38:02,708
Noby! Shizuka is here!

464
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:06,847
It'll make Shizuka hate you.
So will everyone else too.

465
00:38:07,043 --> 00:38:11,043
Got it?
One sip was enough!

466
00:38:17,142 --> 00:38:21,142
Nothing's happening.

467
00:38:28,077 --> 00:38:32,110
What's wrong, Doraemon?

468
00:38:34,389 --> 00:38:38,989
Doraemon?

469
00:38:43,763 --> 00:38:45,796
I don't feel well.

470
00:38:47,636 --> 00:38:51,169
I can't stand it,
Just being close to you...

471
00:38:51,822 --> 00:38:54,522
You make me sick!

472
00:39:04,289 --> 00:39:11,089
I drank too much.
I feel sick.

473
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:13,301
Help!

474
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,451
Oh, no..

475
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,507
I'm going to die.

476
00:39:53,968 --> 00:39:57,668
Noby...

477
00:40:01,609 --> 00:40:04,209
Shizuka...

478
00:40:08,058 --> 00:40:11,258
Get it out.
You'll feel better.

479
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:13,671
Go on.

480
00:40:20,611 --> 00:40:24,878
How odd...Why was I running?

481
00:40:25,964 --> 00:40:29,564
Phew. I feel better.

482
00:40:29,624 --> 00:40:33,624
I thought you poisoned yourself.

483
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:40,726
Were you that worried about me?

484
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:44,206
Of course I was! You're my friend!

485
00:40:44,299 --> 00:40:47,899
And don't be so weak!
It's just Mr.S!

486
00:40:50,415 --> 00:40:51,548
You jerk.

487
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:54,590
Jerk.

488
00:40:54,634 --> 00:40:59,634
Oh, boy..that was really tough.

489
00:40:59,702 --> 00:41:03,202
Oh my God! Why?!?

490
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:07,899
She was so mad at me.

491
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:16,361
The stars are so pretty tonight.

492
00:41:21,683 --> 00:41:23,483
What's the matter?

493
00:41:24,028 --> 00:41:29,095
You see, because of today's events,
your future has started to...

494
00:41:29,126 --> 00:41:30,126
I'm not telling you.

495
00:41:31,287 --> 00:41:32,821
What are you talking about?

496
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,447
Nothing. 
If I tell you, you'll get lazy.

497
00:41:36,455 --> 00:41:39,955
Oh, come on. 
Tell me. Just a little bit.

498
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,453
- Tell me!
- Why should I?

499
00:41:46,521 --> 00:41:49,721
- I said tell me!
- That tickles.

500
00:41:51,064 --> 00:41:53,231
It's dangerous up here.

501
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:54,239
You're right.

502
00:41:55,018 --> 00:41:58,918
When your future 
is starting to look good...

503
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,220
What? Look good?

504
00:42:01,763 --> 00:42:03,763
Wanna take a peek?

505
00:42:03,784 --> 00:42:06,384
Oh yeah!

506
00:42:07,503 --> 00:42:10,703
Where did it go? Let me see.

507
00:42:10,724 --> 00:42:11,724
Here it is!

508
00:42:11,958 --> 00:42:14,225
At this point...

509
00:42:14,705 --> 00:42:16,438
...this is your future.

510
00:42:21,989 --> 00:42:23,322
A grown-up Shizuka.

511
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,360
She's so pretty.

512
00:42:26,139 --> 00:42:30,506
The boy gettng a spanking 
looks exactly like you.

513
00:42:30,513 --> 00:42:32,413
That means...

514
00:42:35,237 --> 00:42:38,804
I must have married...

515
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:41,448
Shizuka!?

516
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:52,066
Yes! Yes!

517
00:42:52,124 --> 00:42:54,124
This is awesome!!

518
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:59,172
Thank you, Doraemon.
I owe everything to you.

519
00:42:59,761 --> 00:43:02,128
You're wrong, Noby.

520
00:43:02,631 --> 00:43:05,031
Out of the millions of possibilities...

521
00:43:05,515 --> 00:43:08,615
...you grabbed the opportunity.

522
00:43:08,674 --> 00:43:11,374
My future changed.

523
00:43:11,462 --> 00:43:13,762
Your new future.

524
00:43:13,781 --> 00:43:18,381
Yeah, my new future.

525
00:43:18,384 --> 00:43:23,584
Your kindness is about 
to change the future.

526
00:43:32,815 --> 00:43:35,148
Will you marry me?

527
00:43:35,218 --> 00:43:37,218
Yes, I'd love to.

528
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:43,439
You're proposing to her?!
That's not fair!

529
00:43:50,404 --> 00:43:54,404
No, Noby.
We're practicing for Cinderella.

530
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,453
We're putting on a play.

531
00:43:59,409 --> 00:44:00,409
What?

532
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,467
It's not working.

533
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:07,174
Actually I was surprised too.

534
00:44:07,246 --> 00:44:10,713
Why would Shizuka marry you?

535
00:44:10,793 --> 00:44:13,793
There's so many better guys out there.

536
00:44:13,795 --> 00:44:14,795
Watch it!

537
00:44:15,491 --> 00:44:18,891
When my future was 
starting to look good...

538
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:24,267
She might end up marrying Ace.

539
00:44:24,887 --> 00:44:28,954
If you're that worried, 
let's watch Time TV.

540
00:44:30,884 --> 00:44:32,884
You're supposed to get engaged...

541
00:44:33,571 --> 00:44:37,171
...14 years from now on Oct 25.

542
00:44:37,686 --> 00:44:40,519
So let's see what 
happened a little before that.

543
00:44:40,549 --> 00:44:42,549
Are you serious?

544
00:44:48,427 --> 00:44:51,127
That's you grown up.

545
00:44:51,428 --> 00:44:53,661
same as ever.

546
00:44:54,206 --> 00:44:57,206
Mountain climbing?

547
00:44:57,279 --> 00:44:59,879
Are you going or not?

548
00:45:00,338 --> 00:45:01,338
That's Shizuka.

549
00:45:01,477 --> 00:45:04,877
I want to.
But I hate climbing.

550
00:45:04,959 --> 00:45:07,459
I would if the mountain's flat.

551
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:09,843
You need to grow up.

552
00:45:10,681 --> 00:45:14,081
Whatever. I'll take another friend.

553
00:45:20,636 --> 00:45:23,303
I can't watch this.
Fast forward it.

554
00:45:25,974 --> 00:45:26,974
What?

555
00:45:27,368 --> 00:45:29,168
Shizuka's alone.

556
00:45:29,219 --> 00:45:31,219
She must have gotten 
separated in the blizzard.

557
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:34,730
- She's in trouble!
- You're right.

558
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:37,299
What's grown-up Noby doing?

559
00:45:38,128 --> 00:45:40,928
In bed with a cold.

560
00:45:41,003 --> 00:45:43,103
Oh, man.

561
00:45:44,285 --> 00:45:48,585
Wait. I got it!

562
00:45:48,872 --> 00:45:51,005
Time Kerchief, please.

563
00:45:51,409 --> 00:45:54,476
What are you gonna do with it?

564
00:45:54,548 --> 00:45:57,648
This fast forward things, right?

565
00:46:02,213 --> 00:46:03,713
14 years from now.

566
00:46:03,779 --> 00:46:07,779
I'll ride the Time Machine 
and go save Shizuka.

567
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:10,033
Are you okay, Shizuka?

568
00:46:10,732 --> 00:46:17,465
You're wonderful, Noby!
And we'll get married.

569
00:46:18,946 --> 00:46:21,346
Will it work that well?

570
00:46:21,705 --> 00:46:24,705
I'll go get ready!

571
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:27,415
I'm ready.

572
00:46:27,509 --> 00:46:28,809
Come on. Let's go to the future.

573
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:33,170
Wait a second.

574
00:46:33,506 --> 00:46:36,006
You're not thinking thoroughly.

575
00:46:36,023 --> 00:46:39,723
Using the Time Machine 
could change the future again.

576
00:46:40,169 --> 00:46:41,569
What?

577
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:44,910
It doesn't necessarily 
change for the better.

578
00:46:45,858 --> 00:46:48,991
You're so dramatic.

579
00:46:49,071 --> 00:46:50,971
I have to hurry 
and go save her.

580
00:46:55,629 --> 00:47:00,862
Hang on tight. If you fall off, 
you'll be lost forever in time.

581
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:04,363
Okay. Here we go then.

582
00:47:22,814 --> 00:47:26,247
My house is a public toilet.

583
00:47:26,299 --> 00:47:29,599
The neighborhood turned into a park.

584
00:47:30,728 --> 00:47:31,728
Everything's so different.

585
00:47:32,647 --> 00:47:36,547
Let's go. Get out Anywhere Door.

586
00:47:36,642 --> 00:47:40,242
You make me work hard.

587
00:47:41,087 --> 00:47:43,987
Take me to Shizuka!

588
00:47:49,573 --> 00:47:51,373
There she is!

589
00:47:52,181 --> 00:47:56,981
You stay behind. 
I'm going to save her without your help.

590
00:47:57,399 --> 00:47:59,899
Shizuka!

591
00:48:00,303 --> 00:48:02,203
Good luck.

592
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:13,858
Shizuka!

593
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:18,526
It can't be...

594
00:48:18,802 --> 00:48:20,202
Shizu...!

595
00:48:20,352 --> 00:48:23,285
The cottage is still far away.

596
00:48:24,428 --> 00:48:25,428
Shi...!

597
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:30,553
It's been 3 hours 
since we got separated.

598
00:48:32,798 --> 00:48:36,931
Shizuka, you okay?!

599
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:39,781
It's me, Noby.

600
00:48:42,564 --> 00:48:45,931
Noby? Why are you here?

601
00:48:46,753 --> 00:48:48,820
It doesn't matter.

602
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:51,870
Everything will be 
fine now that I'm here.

603
00:48:51,902 --> 00:48:55,902
When you're lost in a snowstorm, 
don't walk around blind.

604
00:48:55,922 --> 00:48:59,822
First of all, check the map. 
This is the iron rule.

605
00:49:03,397 --> 00:49:04,997
Uh-oh...

606
00:49:05,921 --> 00:49:10,387
That's a world map. 
That's so you.

607
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:16,993
This Auto Compass 
will show us the direction.

608
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,079
That's convenient.

609
00:49:24,602 --> 00:49:27,335
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

610
00:49:28,373 --> 00:49:34,106
When we were kids, Doraemon would 
come to your recue at times like this.

611
00:49:36,172 --> 00:49:38,072
What did you say?

612
00:49:38,393 --> 00:49:41,793
I wonder how Doraemon is doing.

613
00:49:42,931 --> 00:49:45,464
Probably taking a nap or something.

614
00:49:47,601 --> 00:49:50,234
Oh, Noby...You're so silly.

615
00:49:50,428 --> 00:49:53,428
Just like a kid.

616
00:49:53,513 --> 00:49:54,513
Kid?! She knows?!

617
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:58,730
There's a cave. 
Let's take a break.

618
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:04,564
We have to make sure 
we don't freeze to death.

619
00:50:04,978 --> 00:50:07,211
Let's start a fire.

620
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,333
The matches are wet.

621
00:50:11,722 --> 00:50:14,822
No worries.
I know how to start a fire.

622
00:50:15,869 --> 00:50:19,269
I just have to rub 
2 sticks together.

623
00:50:19,326 --> 00:50:21,126
Now's my chance.

624
00:50:21,141 --> 00:50:22,741
I have to...

625
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:25,733
Impress her.

626
00:50:25,802 --> 00:50:28,202
It's not working.

627
00:50:28,914 --> 00:50:31,014
Want my lighter?

628
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:38,470
Why didn't you tell me?

629
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:42,544
I didn't want to interrupt.

630
00:50:46,795 --> 00:50:48,795
Do you have a cold?

631
00:50:49,223 --> 00:50:52,890
I don't feel too well 
but it's no big deal.

632
00:50:53,838 --> 00:50:56,105
She caught it 
from the grown-up Noby.

633
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:58,507
Nothing.

634
00:50:58,949 --> 00:51:03,782
When you came to see me, 
I must have given it to you.

635
00:51:04,468 --> 00:51:08,368
It's my fault.
I don't take good care of myself.

636
00:51:12,962 --> 00:51:15,895
Wear this. I'll be fine.

637
00:51:17,996 --> 00:51:19,596
It's wet.

638
00:51:19,957 --> 00:51:23,090
Your clothes must be wet too.
Aren't you cold?

639
00:51:24,028 --> 00:51:27,228
Now that you mention it...
I'm cold.

640
00:51:27,343 --> 00:51:29,543
You better take them off.

641
00:51:29,569 --> 00:51:30,569
I don't have change.

642
00:51:32,955 --> 00:51:34,755
I have an emergency blanket.

643
00:51:35,537 --> 00:51:36,537
Thanks.

644
00:51:43,084 --> 00:51:45,084
This is really warm.

645
00:51:45,437 --> 00:51:46,837
I'm glad.

646
00:52:03,424 --> 00:52:06,424
Is your cold getting worse?

647
00:52:06,475 --> 00:52:11,375
What should we do?
You could die!

648
00:52:11,452 --> 00:52:15,152
Don't say that.

649
00:52:15,585 --> 00:52:17,185
You really haven't changed at all.

650
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:23,370
I worry about you. 
You need someone to look after you.

651
00:52:23,545 --> 00:52:33,845
Yeah...allright.
The answer to your question is...

652
00:52:33,857 --> 00:52:35,357
Yes.

653
00:52:38,187 --> 00:52:42,920
I thought you'd be happier.

654
00:52:46,353 --> 00:52:49,453
Shizuka!

655
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,267
What should I do?

656
00:52:52,323 --> 00:52:56,423
Help, Help, Doraemon!

657
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:57,965
Doraemon!!

658
00:53:02,716 --> 00:53:05,983
This nice weather 
is making me drowsy.

659
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:08,483
Shizuka!

660
00:53:10,997 --> 00:53:13,797
I'll take her to Anywhere Door.

661
00:53:23,521 --> 00:53:25,321
This yummy bun is so yummy...

662
00:53:26,525 --> 00:53:28,792
I'll share one with you...

663
00:53:38,453 --> 00:53:41,653
It should be somewhere around here.

664
00:53:46,697 --> 00:53:51,164
Warning. Pulse rate is dropping.
Contact a physician immediately.

665
00:53:51,767 --> 00:53:52,767
Oh, no!

666
00:53:56,263 --> 00:53:57,663
Ha! The Auto Compass!

667
00:54:10,744 --> 00:54:12,144
I twisted my ankle.

668
00:54:13,624 --> 00:54:17,357
I even lost my glasses.
Ican't see anything.

669
00:54:17,451 --> 00:54:20,851
Using the Time Machine 
could change the future again.

670
00:54:20,916 --> 00:54:24,916
Oh my God! What should I do?!

671
00:54:25,736 --> 00:54:28,703
It doesn't necessarily 
change for the better.

672
00:54:28,935 --> 00:54:30,802
This isn't ehat I wanted!

673
00:54:31,244 --> 00:54:34,044
Please! Shizuka will die!

674
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:36,330
I'll study!
I'll do anything!

675
00:54:36,407 --> 00:54:37,807
I'll change!

676
00:54:39,023 --> 00:54:41,256
What are you doing?!

677
00:54:45,009 --> 00:54:46,942
I didn't think thoroughly.

678
00:54:54,234 --> 00:54:55,234
It's my fault.

679
00:54:56,054 --> 00:54:58,421
I have to do something by myself.

680
00:54:58,437 --> 00:55:00,637
There must be a way.

681
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:08,243
I have to believe in him

682
00:55:11,853 --> 00:55:15,620
The watch is still working.

683
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:18,570
I memorized the time 
and the year right now.

684
00:55:18,576 --> 00:55:20,676
Now it's up to the grown-up Noby.
I'll believe in myself.

685
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:24,910
Go! This memory!
Please, future me!

686
00:55:24,918 --> 00:55:27,018
Remember this incindent!

687
00:55:27,613 --> 00:55:33,846
I wouldn't forget 
the biggest crisis of my life!

688
00:55:34,346 --> 00:55:36,313
Go! Go!

689
00:55:36,338 --> 00:55:37,338
Go!

690
00:55:38,182 --> 00:55:39,982
This memory!

691
00:56:35,861 --> 00:56:36,861
Hey!

692
00:56:37,947 --> 00:56:38,947
Hey!

693
00:56:39,572 --> 00:56:42,505
The memory reached him!

694
00:56:44,632 --> 00:56:47,565
Hey! You guys okay?!

695
00:57:04,575 --> 00:57:05,575
You remembered.

696
00:57:06,472 --> 00:57:11,705
Yeah. I was in bed with 
a cold and suddenly remembered.

697
00:57:12,121 --> 00:57:15,621
It's like the memory 
flew into my head.

698
00:57:15,658 --> 00:57:16,658
It felt weird.

699
00:57:18,423 --> 00:57:21,756
I didn't know why 
I had forgotten it.

700
00:57:22,519 --> 00:57:27,919
Then I couldn't sit still 
anymore and rushed to come here.

701
00:57:28,352 --> 00:57:30,352
I was scared.

702
00:57:32,758 --> 00:57:36,158
You're okay now.
Your plan worked.

703
00:57:36,813 --> 00:57:40,113
It's weird saying 
this to myself but...

704
00:57:40,205 --> 00:57:43,105
Thanks for believing in me.

705
00:57:47,303 --> 00:57:49,903
I only had me to rely on.

706
00:57:50,471 --> 00:57:53,638
Thanks for relying on me.

707
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:59,323
Now let's hurry.
I'm worried about Shizuka.

708
00:58:15,443 --> 00:58:16,443
He's back.

709
00:58:23,056 --> 00:58:27,589
- How is she?
- She was in real danger.

710
00:58:27,635 --> 00:58:31,135
But she's okay.
She'll be fine.

711
00:58:31,304 --> 00:58:33,704
Thanks to you.

712
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:36,477
That's great.

713
00:58:38,634 --> 00:58:40,634
Huh?

714
00:58:40,724 --> 00:58:41,724
Doraemon.

715
00:58:43,414 --> 00:58:45,914
- Yeah.
- Shall I go get him?

716
00:58:48,439 --> 00:58:50,739
No, Don't.

717
00:58:51,583 --> 00:58:53,583
Why not?

718
00:58:54,658 --> 00:58:57,391
Doraemon is your...

719
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:01,000
My friend from childhood.

720
00:59:01,289 --> 00:59:04,422
Cherish your time with him.

721
00:59:08,279 --> 00:59:11,679
I should go home.
I feel a fever coming on.

722
00:59:11,686 --> 00:59:17,286
Yeah. Um..Thanks, me.

723
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,280
Take car, me.

724
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:20,300
See ya.

725
00:59:21,127 --> 00:59:25,927
The grown-up Shizuka said 
something before she passed out!

726
00:59:26,465 --> 00:59:28,465
She said something?

727
00:59:29,084 --> 00:59:31,651
She said her answer is yes!

728
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:34,890
Her answer is yes?

729
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:37,781
What?!

730
00:59:40,284 --> 00:59:42,384
Again...

731
00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:44,989
Tell me again!

732
00:59:45,251 --> 00:59:50,251
The grown-up Shizuka said 
her answer to your question is yes.

733
00:59:51,535 --> 00:59:55,335
That's...That's...

734
00:59:55,417 --> 00:59:57,617
That's...!

735
00:59:57,679 --> 01:00:02,379
Ouch! What's the matter?

736
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:08,874
Yes!! Are you sure she said that?

737
01:00:08,981 --> 01:00:10,981
I don't get it.

738
01:00:13,285 --> 01:00:17,218
I proposed to her.

739
01:00:17,912 --> 01:00:20,845
I'm impressed by me, Noby.

740
01:00:21,272 --> 01:00:25,205
She didn't give me 
an answer for a long time.

741
01:00:29,019 --> 01:00:30,952
Are you okay?

742
01:00:31,891 --> 01:00:35,891
I have to go.
I have to go see Shizuka.

743
01:00:38,905 --> 01:00:41,205
Shizuka!!

744
01:00:42,494 --> 01:00:45,994
He completely lost his cool 
just because she said yes.

745
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:48,179
He proposed and she said yes...

746
01:00:52,186 --> 01:00:54,419
We're getting married?

747
01:00:58,894 --> 01:01:02,394
Doraemon!

748
01:01:03,239 --> 01:01:07,039
What? Are you serious?

749
01:01:07,077 --> 01:01:08,777
Really? Really?

750
01:01:09,145 --> 01:01:13,278
Yes! That's wonderful!

751
01:01:14,525 --> 01:01:18,625
Noby, that's great!
I'm so happy for you!

752
01:01:18,681 --> 01:01:26,181
Wow! You're amazing!

753
01:01:33,125 --> 01:01:36,725
- Shall we go watch?
- Yeah. Let's.

754
01:01:41,205 --> 01:01:43,672
The wedding!

755
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:50,097
- We're here.
- Today's your wedding.

756
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:52,910
I'm getting nervous.

757
01:01:52,973 --> 01:01:56,073
Look.

758
01:01:56,136 --> 01:01:58,036
On the way to the wedding.

759
01:01:58,054 --> 01:02:00,154
Let's follow!
We need Hopters!

760
01:02:00,907 --> 01:02:02,707
Here.

761
01:02:06,523 --> 01:02:07,923
He's in a rush.

762
01:02:07,929 --> 01:02:12,129
Probably running late 
even on a day like this.

763
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:22,243
Wow, This is the future world.

764
01:02:24,016 --> 01:02:25,216
Naby, watch out!

765
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:36,770
- Behind you!
- Behind me?

766
01:02:59,707 --> 01:03:02,207
Sorry.

767
01:03:02,606 --> 01:03:04,306
Let's go.

768
01:03:18,519 --> 01:03:20,519
I'm oby Nobi!
I'm sorry I'm late!

769
01:03:22,821 --> 01:03:27,088
Your ceremony is scheduled for tomorrow.

770
01:03:27,269 --> 01:03:29,269
What?

771
01:03:30,707 --> 01:03:33,640
The wedding is tomorrow.

772
01:03:33,667 --> 01:03:37,267
You may be older but you haven't changed.

773
01:03:37,334 --> 01:03:40,534
Then why did we arrive today?

774
01:03:41,428 --> 01:03:43,261
I made a mistake.

775
01:03:43,751 --> 01:03:45,684
See?
Everyone makes mistakes.

776
01:03:45,701 --> 01:03:50,701
But now that we're here 
let's stay and watch you.

777
01:03:50,742 --> 01:03:52,742
Yeah.

778
01:03:55,365 --> 01:03:57,065
Hi, Sneech.

779
01:03:57,148 --> 01:04:00,348
Where are you?
Tonight's your bachelor party.

780
01:04:00,407 --> 01:04:03,207
At Big G's house.

781
01:04:03,242 --> 01:04:04,242
Oh, yeah.

782
01:04:09,061 --> 01:04:14,494
I still can't believe it.
You're getting married tomorrow.

783
01:04:14,582 --> 01:04:20,082
I bet Shizuka is gonna 
look so pretty tomorrow.

784
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,700
We all had crushes on her.

785
01:04:23,958 --> 01:04:27,525
But she fell for you.

786
01:04:27,585 --> 01:04:29,685
Make her happy, okay?

787
01:04:30,214 --> 01:04:32,114
Yeah.

788
01:04:32,426 --> 01:04:37,126
I wish I were 
the one to make her happy.

789
01:04:38,502 --> 01:04:42,269
But she said I can do 
everything on my own.

790
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:46,045
I see. You too, Ace?

791
01:04:46,089 --> 01:04:50,489
- Noby! Stay right there!
- Yeah, stay there.

792
01:04:50,497 --> 01:04:55,497
If it was Ace, I could give up. 
But why you?

793
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:57,980
You're just Noby.

794
01:04:58,378 --> 01:05:01,411
You're so lucky.

795
01:05:01,488 --> 01:05:03,688
That hurts, Big G.

796
01:05:03,987 --> 01:05:05,987
What's so funny?

797
01:05:06,366 --> 01:05:09,099
Keep it down!
I have a deadline!

798
01:05:09,203 --> 01:05:09,903
Little G.

799
01:05:10,028 --> 01:05:12,728
Hi, Little G.
Long time no see.

800
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:15,553
Noby, congratulations.
You're getting married.

801
01:05:15,970 --> 01:05:18,237
She became a manga artist.

802
01:05:18,411 --> 01:05:23,278
If you make Shizuka cry, 
my pen will coming after you.

803
01:05:23,887 --> 01:05:28,787
I know, I know.
Thank you.

804
01:05:28,922 --> 01:05:30,722
I look so happy.

805
01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:32,985
You're practically drooling.

806
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:36,793
I can't watch anymore.

807
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:38,870
I wonder what Shizuka is doing.

808
01:05:38,967 --> 01:05:42,967
Probably crying about 
her hasty decision to say yes.

809
01:05:43,247 --> 01:05:47,147
Thanks a lot.
Now I have to go see.

810
01:05:47,236 --> 01:05:48,936
Wait!

811
01:05:54,370 --> 01:05:55,370
Come in.

812
01:05:57,298 --> 01:06:02,798
Dad, I'm going to sleep now.
Good night.

813
01:06:03,957 --> 01:06:05,957
Good night.

814
01:06:06,698 --> 01:06:08,931
She seems down.

815
01:06:08,968 --> 01:06:11,868
You can't blame her.
She's marrying you.

816
01:06:13,823 --> 01:06:14,823
Good night.

817
01:06:17,962 --> 01:06:22,229
That's it?
But she's getting married tomorrow...

818
01:06:22,264 --> 01:06:25,464
It's hard to talk 
at times like this.

819
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,420
Truth Transmitter.

820
01:06:28,475 --> 01:06:30,608
If someone has 
something they're holding back...

821
01:06:30,677 --> 01:06:34,177
...this makes them want 
to get it off their chest.

822
01:06:35,328 --> 01:06:37,228
Dad!

823
01:06:38,962 --> 01:06:41,662
I want to call off the wedding.

824
01:06:42,256 --> 01:06:44,256
- Why?!
- Dad...

825
01:06:44,882 --> 01:06:45,882
What's wrong?

826
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:49,495
You'll miss me when I'm gone.

827
01:06:49,877 --> 01:06:51,944
Of course I will.

828
01:06:52,234 --> 01:06:56,867
You and mom have taken 
such good care of me.

829
01:06:56,882 --> 01:06:58,782
But me...

830
01:06:58,826 --> 01:07:02,426
I haven't done 
anything for you in return.

831
01:07:04,816 --> 01:07:06,783
Don't be silly.

832
01:07:06,785 --> 01:07:11,718
You've given us 
so many wonderful things.

833
01:07:12,412 --> 01:07:14,212
I have?

834
01:07:14,775 --> 01:07:17,575
So many I lost count.

835
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:23,113
Your first gift was that you were born.

836
01:07:23,215 --> 01:07:24,815
It was 3 am.

837
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:29,510
Your first cry sounded 
like an angel's trumpet.

838
01:07:30,177 --> 01:07:34,110
The most beautiful music I've ever heard.

839
01:07:34,308 --> 01:07:38,441
When I left the hospital, 
the sky was beginning to light up.

840
01:07:39,558 --> 01:07:44,425
But there were still 
stars scattered in the sky.

841
01:07:44,871 --> 01:07:47,004
In this vast universe...

842
01:07:47,705 --> 01:07:51,938
...a new life was born 
carrying my blood.

843
01:07:51,943 --> 01:07:58,376
I was so moved 
that I couldn't stop crying.

844
01:07:58,828 --> 01:08:02,028
And everyday, 
every year since then...

845
01:08:02,325 --> 01:08:10,025
All the happy memories.
We can't ask for anything better.

846
01:08:10,047 --> 01:08:14,347
We'll miss you but 
those memories will keep us happy.

847
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:18,800
You don't have to worry.

848
01:08:18,899 --> 01:08:21,799
I'm afraid.

849
01:08:21,827 --> 01:08:23,927
Will we be all right?

850
01:08:23,989 --> 01:08:28,489
Sure you will be.
Have faith in Noby.

851
01:08:28,545 --> 01:08:33,245
You were right in choosing him.

852
01:08:33,296 --> 01:08:37,296
He's an ordinary guy 
with no particular talent.

853
01:08:37,448 --> 01:08:43,148
But he wants people to be happy 
and cries for their pain.

854
01:08:43,159 --> 01:08:47,759
That's what makes a good human being.

855
01:08:47,826 --> 01:08:53,326
I'm confident he will make you happy.

856
01:08:53,344 --> 01:08:58,344
And I'm proud of you for choosing him.

857
01:08:58,435 --> 01:09:03,835
Don't worry.
Everything will work out fine.

858
01:09:06,044 --> 01:09:07,444
Okay.

859
01:09:11,339 --> 01:09:15,739
Why don't we watch 
the wedding on another day?

860
01:09:16,021 --> 01:09:20,788
Yeah. Let's go back to the present day.

861
01:09:20,833 --> 01:09:23,333
I miss Shizuka, the one in my era.

862
01:09:33,181 --> 01:09:36,548
What's up?
What's so urgent?

863
01:09:36,678 --> 01:09:38,878
- Shizuka...
- Noby?

864
01:09:41,173 --> 01:09:45,840
I'll make you happy.
Forever and ever!

865
01:09:46,077 --> 01:09:50,377
I promise you.

866
01:09:56,124 --> 01:09:59,024
You're so slow, Doraemon!

867
01:10:04,930 --> 01:10:06,830
Doraemon...

868
01:10:09,072 --> 01:10:11,005
Can I borrow a Hopter?

869
01:10:11,278 --> 01:10:14,311
Okay, here.

870
01:10:17,725 --> 01:10:18,725
Come here.

871
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:20,640
What is it?

872
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:22,580
You see...

873
01:10:24,497 --> 01:10:26,697
Right now...

874
01:10:28,718 --> 01:10:30,718
I'm...

875
01:10:33,884 --> 01:10:36,584
Just say it.

876
01:10:36,592 --> 01:10:41,392
I'm so super happy that I want...

877
01:10:41,455 --> 01:10:44,455
...the whole world to know!

878
01:10:50,131 --> 01:10:55,498
<i> Noby's happiness confirmed.
Mission Program accomplished. </i>

879
01:10:55,518 --> 01:10:59,018
<i> Return to the future in 48 hours. </i>

880
01:10:59,569 --> 01:11:03,102
Oh, yeah.
That's how Soby programmed it.

881
01:11:07,351 --> 01:11:09,951
I'm so glad.

882
01:11:10,043 --> 01:11:13,443
I'm relieved.

883
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:17,040
Now I can finally go back.

884
01:11:18,913 --> 01:11:20,913
You really are...

885
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:23,407
...klutzy and slow.

886
01:11:24,496 --> 01:11:27,063
You hate to study.

887
01:11:27,564 --> 01:11:30,831
You're timid and lazy.

888
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:35,797
You're so bad at sports.

889
01:11:36,601 --> 01:11:41,001
Cowardly and forgetful.

890
01:11:41,044 --> 01:11:46,444
You're unreliable and you goof off.

891
01:11:48,641 --> 01:11:53,674
You're a wimp and a slow learner.

892
01:11:55,824 --> 01:12:00,824
A pushover and a luck pusher.

893
01:12:00,869 --> 01:12:04,369
A spoiled baby...

894
01:12:07,476 --> 01:12:09,576
Hey!

895
01:12:10,713 --> 01:12:15,280
Uh-oh...What's wrong with me?

896
01:12:28,585 --> 01:12:30,685
Doraemon!

897
01:12:33,748 --> 01:12:36,348
I need a gadget for 
eating pasta through my nose.

898
01:12:36,369 --> 01:12:38,869
If I don't, Big G's gonna beat me up!

899
01:12:40,116 --> 01:12:43,316
Don't make promises you can't keep!

900
01:12:43,372 --> 01:12:48,439
You always depend on me!
do things on your own for once!

901
01:12:48,716 --> 01:12:51,382
Why are you so mad?
What's wrong?

902
01:12:51,748 --> 01:12:54,048
I'll tell you what's wrong!

903
01:12:54,576 --> 01:12:58,676
I can't help you anymore
when you're in trouble!

904
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,400
What do you mean?

905
01:13:05,053 --> 01:13:08,353
What's gotten into you?

906
01:13:08,746 --> 01:13:13,646
I can't stay here anymore.

907
01:13:15,467 --> 01:13:17,867
Do something!

908
01:13:18,221 --> 01:13:20,021
I'm sorry, Noby.

909
01:13:20,393 --> 01:13:24,593
I have to go back tomorrow 
or I'm in trouble.

910
01:13:25,905 --> 01:13:30,238
Noby, that's enough.

911
01:13:30,508 --> 01:13:32,508
Let him go.

912
01:13:32,852 --> 01:13:35,052
Come back and visit us.

913
01:13:35,148 --> 01:13:38,448
But this program...

914
01:13:38,486 --> 01:13:42,086
...won't let me 
come back to this era.

915
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:46,255
Is that right?
We'll miss you.

916
01:13:47,243 --> 01:13:51,076
- Take care.
- No! Don't go, Doraemon!

917
01:13:51,109 --> 01:13:55,509
I don't want to.
I'd stay if I could.

918
01:13:55,512 --> 01:13:59,312
<i> Improper words detected </i>

919
01:13:59,346 --> 01:14:01,046
Oops!

920
01:14:04,689 --> 01:14:07,689
I'll go back to the future!

921
01:14:07,778 --> 01:14:08,778
Doraemon!

922
01:14:09,162 --> 01:14:11,995
Are you okay?!
Doraemon?

923
01:14:13,701 --> 01:14:18,601
I can't defy the Mission Program.

924
01:14:27,657 --> 01:14:31,557
Noby, I don't know what to say.

925
01:14:36,355 --> 01:14:38,221
Don't be so sad.

926
01:14:43,498 --> 01:14:48,598
Your future changed.
Be happy.

927
01:14:48,678 --> 01:14:52,478
It's meaningless without you.

928
01:14:53,944 --> 01:14:58,744
You changed as well.
You're not the guy I first met.

929
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:06,459
Still...

930
01:15:07,171 --> 01:15:10,271
I'm worried.

931
01:15:10,983 --> 01:15:15,817
I wish I could stay with you.

932
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:19,770
Will you be okay without me?

933
01:15:21,208 --> 01:15:25,408
Will you be able 
to stand up to Big G dan Sneech?

934
01:15:27,995 --> 01:15:28,995
Noby!

935
01:15:35,599 --> 01:15:38,199
- Where are you going?
- Leave me alone.

936
01:15:38,213 --> 01:15:39,813
Noby!

937
01:15:48,262 --> 01:15:50,262
Doraemon, you idiot...

938
01:15:50,321 --> 01:15:53,521
You know I'm not okay on my own.

939
01:15:54,929 --> 01:15:57,929
Hey, Noby!

940
01:15:59,806 --> 01:16:02,506
I'm glad you're here.

941
01:16:05,164 --> 01:16:06,164
Big G...

942
01:16:07,699 --> 01:16:10,199
Have you decided?

943
01:16:10,741 --> 01:16:13,341
Eat pasta through your nose?

944
01:16:13,426 --> 01:16:16,226
Or get beat up by me?

945
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:19,949
Help me, Dora....?

946
01:16:20,464 --> 01:16:24,764
<i>Will you be able 
to stand up to Big G dan Sneech?</i>

947
01:16:28,010 --> 01:16:30,343
- Hold on!
- Huh?

948
01:16:33,425 --> 01:16:35,225
<i>Can you do it alone?</i>

949
01:16:38,164 --> 01:16:39,864
If we're gonna fight...

950
01:16:42,086 --> 01:16:45,086
Let's leave Doraemon out of it.

951
01:16:46,483 --> 01:16:50,283
How brave of you.
Now you're talking.

952
01:16:52,669 --> 01:16:54,769
Ready to start?

953
01:16:55,961 --> 01:16:57,761
It already started!

954
01:17:00,726 --> 01:17:04,226
I wonder where Noby is?

955
01:17:04,247 --> 01:17:06,547
It's our last night together.

956
01:17:10,611 --> 01:17:13,111
So you give up?

957
01:17:13,635 --> 01:17:16,135
Don't ever disrespect me again.

958
01:17:16,967 --> 01:17:19,167
Wait. I haven't lost yet.

959
01:17:20,037 --> 01:17:21,037
What?

960
01:17:21,465 --> 01:17:23,732
You haven't had enough?

961
01:17:24,506 --> 01:17:27,106
I'm just getting started!

962
01:17:33,887 --> 01:17:39,387
He's still not home.
What is he doing? Where is he?

963
01:17:39,416 --> 01:17:43,916
Making me worry even on my last night...

964
01:17:49,801 --> 01:17:52,601
Had enough now?

965
01:17:55,734 --> 01:17:57,334
Not yet!

966
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:03,426
Noby!

967
01:18:03,878 --> 01:18:06,412
Where is he?

968
01:18:15,029 --> 01:18:17,729
Noby!

969
01:18:20,216 --> 01:18:26,216
He's been gone too long.
Something must have happened.

970
01:18:28,546 --> 01:18:32,346
Let go of me!

971
01:18:32,845 --> 01:18:34,645
I've gotta beat you...

972
01:18:36,094 --> 01:18:38,127
...on my own...

973
01:18:43,701 --> 01:18:45,935
I have to show...

974
01:18:46,831 --> 01:18:50,631
...Doraemon that...

975
01:18:51,589 --> 01:18:54,023
...I'll be okay without him!

976
01:18:54,887 --> 01:18:56,687
Buzz off!

977
01:18:59,126 --> 01:19:01,026
You...!

978
01:19:01,635 --> 01:19:03,235
Enough alerady!

979
01:19:47,242 --> 01:19:49,142
Okay, okay, you win.

980
01:19:50,849 --> 01:19:53,149
Forgive me, Noby!

981
01:19:58,733 --> 01:20:02,833
Noby!

982
01:20:13,420 --> 01:20:17,020
I won.

983
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:20,120
You saw, didn't you?

984
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:23,180
I won.

985
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:29,460
By myself.

986
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:37,159
Now you won't 
have to worry about me.

987
01:20:41,915 --> 01:20:44,482
Right, Doraemon?

988
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:19,560
Noby! Finish your breakfast!

989
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Okay.

990
01:21:24,821 --> 01:21:26,321
<i> Doraemon.. </i>

991
01:21:26,363 --> 01:21:32,296
<i> My room feels empty without you </i>

992
01:21:32,674 --> 01:21:34,474
I'm coming!

993
01:21:40,549 --> 01:21:44,849
<i> But I'll get used to it soon </i>

994
01:21:44,849 --> 01:21:49,149
<i> So don't worry about me, Doraemon.</i>

995
01:21:59,605 --> 01:22:02,605
<i> What?! Tsuchinoko? </i>

996
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:06,640
I thought they were a myth!
That's amazing!

997
01:22:06,721 --> 01:22:09,621
Keep your voice down.

998
01:22:09,945 --> 01:22:13,245
I chased it in here 
so poke it from that side.

999
01:22:13,322 --> 01:22:15,722
I'll catch it here.

1000
01:22:15,821 --> 01:22:16,821
Okay.

1001
01:22:27,972 --> 01:22:29,572
Ouch!

1002
01:22:29,932 --> 01:22:31,732
Serves you right!

1003
01:22:33,801 --> 01:22:38,301
Ouch..that was a mean prank.

1004
01:22:39,883 --> 01:22:43,983
Noby!
Thank goodness I found you!

1005
01:22:45,804 --> 01:22:49,437
Stay calm and listen.

1006
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:55,770
Guess who I just saw?

1007
01:22:56,203 --> 01:22:59,103
Ready?

1008
01:22:59,582 --> 01:23:03,882
Do-ra-e-mon.

1009
01:23:05,699 --> 01:23:06,699
Doraemon?!

1010
01:23:07,568 --> 01:23:08,568
Hello?

1011
01:23:12,554 --> 01:23:14,054
Doraemon!!

1012
01:23:17,589 --> 01:23:19,189
Doraemon!?!!

1013
01:23:21,254 --> 01:23:23,054
Mom!?

1014
01:23:27,295 --> 01:23:28,828
Are you okay?

1015
01:23:29,704 --> 01:23:31,737
I'm okay.

1016
01:23:32,081 --> 01:23:33,081
Is Doraemon here?

1017
01:23:33,955 --> 01:23:36,755
What? Is he back?

1018
01:23:37,781 --> 01:23:40,748
He's not here?
That's weird.

1019
01:23:42,718 --> 01:23:45,118
Oh, I know!

1020
01:23:47,874 --> 01:23:52,374
He's being shy and hiding 
with an invinsible Cape.

1021
01:23:52,404 --> 01:23:55,404
I can't wait to see him.

1022
01:23:57,359 --> 01:24:01,359
I think I'll go buy some yummy buns.

1023
01:24:02,342 --> 01:24:05,942
I hope Doraemon is here 
when I come back.

1024
01:24:10,043 --> 01:24:14,443
yummy buns, yummy buns.

1025
01:24:15,902 --> 01:24:19,302
My lie was better than yours.

1026
01:24:19,346 --> 01:24:22,846
Yes, you win.

1027
01:24:23,748 --> 01:24:25,548
You were lying?!

1028
01:24:27,102 --> 01:24:29,402
Today's April Fools' Day!

1029
01:24:29,448 --> 01:24:32,648
You're easier to fool 
than anyone I know.

1030
01:24:38,421 --> 01:24:41,621
- Lie and get us back then.
- Yeah.

1031
01:24:41,636 --> 01:24:44,036
There's a ghost behind you!

1032
01:24:45,094 --> 01:24:49,661
What is this Kindergarten?

1033
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:02,360
Doraemon...

1034
01:25:06,817 --> 01:25:07,817
Oh, yeah!

1035
01:25:08,226 --> 01:25:11,726
When I'm gone...

1036
01:25:11,799 --> 01:25:15,799
...and something really horrible happens...

1037
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:17,819
Here it is.

1038
01:25:18,966 --> 01:25:21,266
<i> Press the switch on the nose. </i>

1039
01:25:22,215 --> 01:25:28,115
<i> You'll find whatever you need inside </i>

1040
01:25:32,442 --> 01:25:35,842
This potion is called Liar Liar Liquid.

1041
01:25:36,455 --> 01:25:40,655
Drink this and 
everything you say will become a lie.

1042
01:25:41,618 --> 01:25:44,118
Perfect for April Fool's Day.

1043
01:25:44,129 --> 01:25:49,229
That lie about Doraemon was 
the cruelest thing they could've said.

1044
01:25:50,748 --> 01:25:52,948
They're gonna regret it.

1045
01:25:54,580 --> 01:25:56,380
Oh no, a ghost!

1046
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:58,601
Look, Big G!

1047
01:25:59,308 --> 01:26:01,308
He looks pumped up.

1048
01:26:01,388 --> 01:26:04,188
Another stupid lie?

1049
01:26:04,212 --> 01:26:06,612
Give it to us.

1050
01:26:07,433 --> 01:26:08,433
Go ahead!

1051
01:26:10,785 --> 01:26:11,785
Will you apologize to me?

1052
01:26:17,187 --> 01:26:19,987
- Then fine.
- Listen to him.

1053
01:26:27,388 --> 01:26:29,388
Nice weather today.

1054
01:26:29,404 --> 01:26:31,804
That's it?

1055
01:26:35,631 --> 01:26:36,631
It's raining hard.

1056
01:26:37,262 --> 01:26:38,862
What did you do?!

1057
01:26:41,143 --> 01:26:42,643
What next?

1058
01:26:43,294 --> 01:26:44,994
He's spooking me out.

1059
01:26:45,030 --> 01:26:49,330
Let's see..

1060
01:26:49,861 --> 01:26:50,861
Sneech...

1061
01:26:54,192 --> 01:26:55,192
Won't be bitten by a dog!

1062
01:26:55,915 --> 01:26:56,915
Dog!

1063
01:26:58,411 --> 01:27:00,511
Dog! Help!

1064
01:27:02,365 --> 01:27:03,365
Big G.

1065
01:27:04,344 --> 01:27:08,044
Your mom is gonna be super nice to you.

1066
01:27:10,137 --> 01:27:12,137
There you are!!

1067
01:27:12,793 --> 01:27:15,393
You're supposed to be 
helping out at the shop!

1068
01:27:16,109 --> 01:27:19,109
You're in big trouble.

1069
01:27:20,311 --> 01:27:22,611
Mom! I'm sorry!

1070
01:27:23,413 --> 01:27:24,413
Mom!!

1071
01:27:38,147 --> 01:27:40,680
- I'm home.
- Hi.

1072
01:27:48,043 --> 01:27:50,143
Did you find Doraemon?

1073
01:27:50,785 --> 01:27:52,585
Of course not.

1074
01:27:59,788 --> 01:28:03,388
Doraemon's not coming back.

1075
01:28:06,689 --> 01:28:09,089
I'm never seeing him again.

1076
01:28:25,314 --> 01:28:26,314
Noby!

1077
01:28:31,151 --> 01:28:33,051
Why? How?

1078
01:28:33,503 --> 01:28:37,503
It was so strange.
Suddenly I was allowed to come back.

1079
01:28:39,845 --> 01:28:42,245
I know why, you drank this...

1080
01:28:42,340 --> 01:28:45,340
...and said I wasn't coming back.

1081
01:28:56,339 --> 01:28:58,239
I'm not happy...

1082
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:04,100
Not happy.
I'm not happy at all.

1083
01:29:06,411 --> 01:29:08,411
Not happy at all.

1084
01:29:10,583 --> 01:29:11,583
Really not happy.

1085
01:29:12,871 --> 01:29:15,971
Forever from now on...

1086
01:29:16,064 --> 01:29:21,564
Doraemon and I won't stay forever...

1087
01:29:22,145 --> 01:29:23,812
No we won't.

1088
01:29:24,333 --> 01:29:27,466
We wil not stay together.

1089
01:29:44,663 --> 01:29:52,830
