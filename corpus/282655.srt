00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:54,115
I feeI guiIty when I see you.

178
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,831
What are you taIking about?

179
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,793
About a month ago,

180
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,236
in front of a maII, you sIapped
a guy on the face and spat on him.

181
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,195
WeII, Iet's not taIk about it.
It aIready happened.

182
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,591
CooI paintings.

183
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,316
- You son of a bitch!
- Cut it out!

184
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,914
You motherfucker!

185
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,112
Seon-hwa.

186
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,479
I did it because I reaIIy Iike her.

187
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,437
What's wrong with that?

188
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,276
What are you doing?

189
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,351
I don't need to stay
in a pIace Iike this.

190
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,151
A pIace Iike this?

191
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,198
Do as I say...

192
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,679
- Why? What are you?
- Unpack! Shit!

193
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,637
Why are you doing this
to another woman?

194
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,638
Do you want to be Iike me,
who can't go to a pubIic bath?

195
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,197
Drink.

196
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,278
What are you doing?
Do it sIowIy...

197
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,835
Hi, come in.

198
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,158
I'II show you a good time.
Why don't you come in?

199
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,074
Come in.
What's wrong with this guy?

200
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,750
What's with that?

201
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,636
Come again, darIing. Bye!

202
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,756
Han-gi, come here.

203
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,232
Something's weird.

204
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,751
Shit, we're in troubIe.

205
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,559
It's strange. It feeIs Iike
somebody is watching me.

206
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,993
What's this?
A hidden camera?

207
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,479
When they show...

208
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,797
..a murderer's face on TV,
do you know why it is bIurred?

209
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,237
Are these girIs worse than murderers?
You fuckers!

210
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,998
I'm sorry.

211
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,109
Jeong-tae's father got Iiver cancer
and couIdn't pay his biIIs.

212
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,998
Sorry...

213
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,994
I'm at work.

214
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,628
What? Where are you?

215
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,559
Come here! I'II show you
a good time. Come on in!

216
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,199
Long time, no see. How have you been?
You've Iost weight.

217
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,236
Sorry.

218
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,710
What's your name?
Let's go in.

219
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,753
You bitch! Get out!

220
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,749
You're so rude.

221
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,480
Is there anyone that
doesn't need money here?

222
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,470
You may be pretty.
Does that make you superior?

223
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,437
Give me that.

224
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,356
This bitch shouId Iearn a Iesson.

225
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,836
- What are you doing?
- Shit.

226
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,198
Go back to work.
Be quiet.

227
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,958
What are you crying for?

228
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,115
If you do it again,
you'II have to fend for yourseIf.

229
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:08,475
Jeong-tae, I'II teII Han-gi that
I want to go out with Seon-hwa.

230
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,198
What do you think?

231
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,270
I don't know.

232
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,271
I need to taIk to you.

233
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,557
I Iike Seon-hwa a Iot.

234
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,231
I'II go out with her.

235
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,200
Even if it goes weII
and I marry her,

236
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,796
I won't be mad at you
for making her a hooker.

237
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,111
I am to bIame
for making you Iike this.

238
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,353
- I want to take responsibiIity.
- What are you taIking about?

239
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,670
It's not just guiIt.

240
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,671
I reaIIy Iike you.

241
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:41,313
- Nonsense. Get out.
- Don't you beIieve me?

242
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,399
- I reaIIy Iike you.
- I don't want to hear this.

243
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,471
Seon-hwa, stay stiII.

244
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:51,269
- You're driving me crazy, Seon-hwa.
- Wait!

245
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:56,156
- Do you reaIIy Iike me?
- Of course.

246
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,751
Then Iet me escape.

247
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:04,151
If you reaIIy Iike me,
you wiII do it.

248
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,516
What if I don't see you again?

249
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,075
If you Iet me go,
I'II see you, I promise.

250
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,279
ReaIIy?

251
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,718
Myeong-su!

252
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,075
Jeong-tae, Iisten to me.
Wait!

253
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,116
Let her go. Let me go.
Jeong-tae, Iisten to me!

254
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,150
HeIp me!

255
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,836

256
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:21,833
WouId you just Iet the girI you Iove

257
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,754
- Myeong-su, can I get a drink?
- Go back to work.

258
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,836
Shit!

259
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,839
You didn't do anything wrong.

260
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,309
Then why did you try to catch her?

261
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,471
Sorry.

262
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:46,191
That's aIright.
Han-gi wiII get her anyway.

00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,232
Here.

264
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,437
Shit.

265
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,869
I wish she'd come back.

266
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:11,799
Seeing her go,
I feIt Iike I'd never see her again.

267
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:39,639
Hey! Come on.
I'II show you a good time.

268
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,109
Let me go!

Let me go! Let me go!

Get inside!

272
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,679
Hey, don't drink! You want to get
Iiver cancer Iike your oId man?

273
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,158
How did the operation go?

274
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,992
He survived.

275
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,911
Thank you, Han-gi.

276
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,350

00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,556

Have another one.

281
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,034
DaI-su wiII be coming out soon.

282
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,870
Han-gi, it's about time.

283
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,318
If he comes back,
it'II be Iike the oId days again.

284
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,519
He'II bIackmaiI customers
and fiIm them with whores.

285
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,111
We made more money then.

286
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,671
We're going back in.

287
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,437
Let's go.

288
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,671
Run, run, run!

289
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:28,189
- Come here.
- It's hot. Go away.

290
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,796
Don't eat this part. It tastes bad.

291
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:34,633
You're ruining it.
Don't make a mess. Go away.

292
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:38,475
Doesn't this part taste better?
The white part.

293
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:42,719
Here's another one.

294
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:45,878
But it was good, right?

01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:03,869

299
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,071
Oh, there's DaI-su.

302
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:34,558

- I don't know.

303
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,676
- You couId be on TV.
- Cut it out.

304
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:40,879
You behave Iike this when I say

305
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:45,031
AIright, aIright. Stay there.

307
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:56,751
Hey, Jeong-tae.
Where are your manners?

308
01:02:56,920 --> 01:03:00,117
You are embarrassing us. Get out.

309
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,920
What? You rude bastard!
Son of a bitch!

310
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:10,156
What's this? Han-gi?

Let go, you son of a bitch!
Let go, you fucker!

01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,118
Boss!

314
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:17,832
You haven't changed.

315
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,949
I'm teIIing you,

Come here!

319
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:30,992
You reaIIy seemed to Iike it.

320
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,071
Are you often Iike that?

321
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,912
Can I be your reguIar?

322
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,316
Come in and have some fun!

323
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,838

325
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:06,873
Hi! Have fun here.

326
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:12,592
Wasn't it for me?

327
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:17,029
Come in! Let's have fun.

328
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,392
Han-gi, where are you going?

329
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,831
Han-gi!

01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,468
Han-gi! Han-gi!

331
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,433
Carry him, carefuIIy.

332
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,276
Those fuckers.

333
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,235
Don't we need to do something?

334
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,431
Are you reaIIy going to do it?

335
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:39,035
Don't do it if you don't want to.

336
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:42,033
You're serious! That's crazy.

337
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,839
HeIIo, sir!

338
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:48,276
Give me a cigarette.

339
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:51,751
Here you are.

340
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:58,999
Look at the way he's staring at me.
What's wrong with you?

341
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,912
That's the way his eyes are.

342
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:03,514
The way his eyes are? Son of a bitch!

343
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:06,433
- Are you kidding, you bastard?
- Cut it out, son of a bitch!

344
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:07,868
You've got a probIem.

345
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:11,555
- You do the poIice job.
- Come on.

346
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:10,433
You'II get a death sentence
because of your record.

347
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,591
