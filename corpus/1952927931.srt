1
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:40,164
Based on actual events

2
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,543
More than 500 war reporters
were killed in the last decade.

3
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:46,503
This film is dedicated
to their memory.

4
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:50,174
Iraq - 2007

5
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,760
(Woman) He can't talk,
so he just films things.

6
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,136
(Man) Yeah, basically.

7
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:57,222
He's even named his camera Dave,
which I find kind of sad.

8
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,433
(Man 2) And we're taping.

9
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,852
Anders. Miriam.

10
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,520
Say hello to the folks at home.

11
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,981
Say, "Greetings from hell."
Come on, guys.

12
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,609
What are you doing back there?
Planning a date?

13
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,946
We're speculating about al-Safi's
motives on giving us this interview.

14
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:17,826
Yeah. Let's talk about something
that really interests people.

15
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:19,244
Like sex.

16
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,081
(Sighs) Sebastian, you are
such a fucking pervert!

17
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,375
Why don't you turn that off, and
save the battery for the real stuff?

18
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:28,170
- Yeah, stop filming us!
- This is the real stuff.

19
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,422
People don't care
about boring old war.

20
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:34,468
They need something juicy
to break away from "American Idol".

21
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,386
Like emergency sex
among reporters.

22
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:39,556
Anders, would you care to explain
that concept to TV audiences?

23
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,059
(Laughs) Why don't you explain it?

24
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,603
You can explain the emergency
sex you have at night,

25
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,397
alone with the internet, you know.

26
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,609
Cos we don't want our sex lives
on your emergency sex show.

27
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:51,985
(Sebastian laughs)

28
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,155
Whoa there, missy!
Did you just say, "Our sex lives"?

29
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,825
Ah, does that mean you guys
are finally doing it?

30
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,701
When we get home
we're gonna have a talk

31
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,121
about your lack
ofjournalistic standards, OK?

32
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,705
You'll be severely disciplined.

33
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,958
(Driver) I see something.
(Sebastian) Where?

34
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,460
- I see someone on the road!
- I don't see anything!

35
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,671
(Gunshots and screaming)

36
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,048
(Sebastian) Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

37
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,717
Fuck! Jesus! Shut the door!

38
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,427
(Screams)

39
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:20,889
- (Sebastian) Is everyone all right?
- Yeah! Get down!

40
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,475
(Sebastian) Get this car in reverse!

41
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,311
Back off! Get us out of here! Press!

42
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,564
Press!

43
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,607
Put the car in reverse!

44
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,735
Move it, motherfucker,
or we're all dead!

45
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,696
Get us the fuck out of here!

46
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,197
(Screams)

47
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,867
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I think the vest caught it.

48
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,451
(Gunshots)

49
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,120
(Screams)

50
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,914
(Sebastian) Is she OK? Is it bad?

51
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,042
She's been hit through the side!
She's bleeding pretty bad!

52
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,670
Stay with me! You stay with me!

53
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:55,340
You keep listening to me! You keep
listening to me! Say my name!

54
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,845
(Gunfire)

55
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,850
- Oh, shit!
- You're gonna be OK. I got you.

56
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,727
Get us the fuck out of here!

57
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,440
We're gonna get you out of here, OK?
Just stay with me!

58
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,860
- Fuck!
- Jesus!

59
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:20,741
(Anders) Don't you go...
Don't you go anywhere! Miriam!

60
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,659
(Speaking Arabic)

61
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,536
(Gunfire)

62
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,957
Fuck!

63
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,464
Miriam!

64
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,174
(Speaking Arabic)

65
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,384
(Gunfire)

66
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,682
(Gunfire continues)

67
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,324
Defensive positions!

68
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,122
Hey, you have to help her first, OK?

69
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,583
Call for medevac! Two urgent surgicals!

70
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,585
Let's go! Come on!

71
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:21,843
- Where are you guys from?
- Georgia! Coalition forces!

72
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,431
Look out! RPG at 12 o'clock!

73
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,937
This saved my life once.

74
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:04,071
Los Angeles - One year later

75
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,747
(On laptop) 'These days,

76
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,084
'violence in the conflict zone
has continued to escalate,

77
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,588
'and now represents a clear threat
to peace in our region.

78
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:26,093
'This is the Caucasus,
where violence harms everyone.

79
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:30,055
'I plead to the separatists,
the Russian Federation,

80
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,307
'and the people of Georgia,

81
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,893
'let's return
to the negotiating table.

82
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,562
(Reporter) 'That was Georgian
President, Mikheil Saakashvili,

83
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:40,273
'who is struggling to move
his country closer to the West.

84
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,943
'This former Soviet republic
has already sent troops

85
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,570
'to assist NATO's missions
in Iraq and Afghanistan,

86
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:49,282
'and would like full membership
in both NATO and the EU.

87
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,661
'Not surprisingly, Georgia's
aspiration to integrate with the West

88
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,123
'is in direct conflict with
Russia's desire to regain influence

89
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,376
'over territory lost in the break-up
of the Soviet Union,

90
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,586
'which according
to Russia's leader, VladimirPutin,

91
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,923
'was the greatest geopolitical
catastrophe of the 20th century.'

92
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,761
(Anders) So, what's going on?

93
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:13,432
'This place is about to blow, man.
There's no one here.

94
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,726
'There's no one in Georgia,
but me Zoe and Stilton.

95
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:20,188
'Just today there was
a police truck, got lit up.

96
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,734
'The peacekeepers have come
under fire on the border.'

97
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,445
Whoa. That's the border...

98
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,905
'The administrative border
with South Ossetia.

99
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,783
'It's one of two breakaway provinces
backed by the Russians.

100
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,910
'Both sides have had
peacekeepers here

101
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,204
'since war broke out here
in the early 90s.'

102
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,165
No one'll fucking insure me.
I can't.

103
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:42,043
I got a special reputation
after Iraq and...

104
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,337
Apparently,
I was a loose cannon before.

105
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,882
- 'You are a loose cannon.'
- Thanks.

106
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,342
'Listen, I don't care what you do.

107
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,803
'Get onto a doc, get your papers
and get over here.'

108
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,473
I know Sebastian's ready
to rock and roll.

109
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,185
'I will dance for you! '

110
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:07,235
Tbilisi, Georgia - August 6, 2008

111
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,335
(Church bells peal)

112
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,637
(Laughter)

113
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,142
(Sebastian) It looks nice.

114
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:42,270
Then again most places do
before war tears 'em up.

115
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:46,816
In the end they all look the same.
And the world barely blinks.

116
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,361
There's that cheer I was missing(!)

117
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,946
I'm just laying out the facts.

118
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:54,741
There could be genocides
on five continents,

119
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,743
people don't give a fuck.

120
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,079
God forbid
their cable goes out, though.

121
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,331
So what's Russia's
big beef here, then?

122
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,667
They just don't want
to see this place go west?

123
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,670
It may have more to do
with the oil pipeline here.

124
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:10,715
It goes direct to Europe which makes
the Russian pipe irrelevant.

125
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:14,427
They're also playing tug-of-war
with a couple of Georgian provinces.

126
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,848
- Welcome to Cold War, the sequel.
- Exactly!

127
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,643
Wanna give Dutchman a call?
See where the others are at.

128
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:22,978
Yeah.

129
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,106
And with Wolf Blitzer,

130
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,276
I think you should mention
the shelling of the villages...

131
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,777
(Phone rings)

132
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,153
(Speaks Georgian)

133
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,199
MrPresident,
your cabinet members are here.

134
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,579
- Would you like me to go?
- No. Please stay.

135
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,498
Gentlemen, you all know Chris,
my US press adviser.

136
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,500
- Hello.
- Yes, please come in.

137
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,461
- Good morning.
- Come in. Tell me news.

138
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,880
Mr President, the latest intelligence

139
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:54,342
indicates the separatists are firing
from the Russian positions,

140
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,219
using their peacekeepers as shields.

141
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,638
That can only mean
willing cooperation.

142
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,891
That could be another attempt
to draw us into wider hostilities.

143
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,769
- Just like in '04.
- We believe this to be different.

144
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:08,064
Russian fighter planes and tanks
are moving towards the conflict zone.

145
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,734
A Russian fleet in the Black Sea
is also on the move.

146
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,154
So you all believe war is certain?

147
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,449
We... we pray not.

148
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:21,244
But the Ossetians, they are refusing
all our efforts in diplomacy.

149
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,997
Our troops are
at their lowest level of readiness.

150
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,833
Several ministers
are also out of the country.

151
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,501
We have no contingency plan...

152
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,212
We'll call them back.
Yes, call them back. Everyone.

153
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:35,842
And I want no response yet
to these provocations. Understood?

154
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,348
The question is what do you wipe
your arse with in Tajikistan?

155
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,643
There is no toilet paper anywhere.
Ever.

156
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:48,229
There's no newspaper, no leaves
on the trees. I had the runs!

157
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,733
I had to slide along the grass,
wipe my arse like a dog.

158
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,820
That's a lovely visual, Stilton.

159
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,989
That's why I drink whisky, my dear.

160
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:02,452
Whatever it is, tummy bugs,
even memories, this kills it.

161
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,329
- (Dutchman) Cheers.
- Cheers.

162
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,875
Whoa!

163
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,504
This stuff has put more experienced
drinkers than you in a coma.

164
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,214
Don't worry about this man, Zoe.

165
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,175
He can drink anyone under the table.
Yours truly excepted.

166
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,386
You got pretty fucked up in Bosnia.

167
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,346
- Me? Never!
- Most definitely.

168
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,933
- Never! You were in Bosnia, too?
- See what I mean?

169
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,227
- (Stilton) What were you? 12?
- 19.

170
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,938
Everything's easier in a miniskirt.

171
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,774
Speaking from personal experience,
are you, Stilton?

172
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,150
(Laughter)

173
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:38,113
(Dutchman)
Hmm. Bosnia's pretty fucked up.

174
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,573
Not as bad as Rwanda, though.

175
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,827
Families hacked and stacked
in churches.

176
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,872
Imagine the attention that would
have got if they'd had oil there.

177
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,417
Yeah, war is like
an old toothless whore.

178
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,001
(Laughter)

179
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,171
- (Anders) Dutchman!
- Disgusting mainly. But then...

180
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,841
Every now and again...

181
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,592
(Growls quietly)

182
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,512
...she gives it to you
like nobody's business.

183
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,890
I mean, special.

185
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,185

186
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,315
Oh, yes, Mommy!

(Laughs)

188
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:20,530
- So, you guys got a... a plan yet?
- We're trying to get hold of Rezo.

189
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,366
Captain Avaliani.
You know, my guy from Iraq?

190
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,577
Thought he might have some leads.

191
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,037
But so far all we know
is his unit's back.

192
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,415
Well, let me know.
I got a guy in Variani.

193
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,042
He can hook you up with a guy
if you need it.

194
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,587
- Where you headed?
- Tskhinvali.

195
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,965
- (Stilton) What?
- What?

196
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:43,303
My dear chaps,
that's the separatists' capital.

197
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,848
I just go where the man tells me,
and point the camera.

Dutchman's guy will meet us
near the village square at midnight.

207
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,474
Oh, God!

208
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:35,021
What do they put in this shit here?
Maybe I'm just getting old.

Roll down your window, will you?

210
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,864
It's no good, mate.
You're gonna have to pull over.

211
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,784
Really?

212
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,456
You all set? Lightweight.

(Groans) Yeah.

214
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,547
Actually, I feel kind of hungry now.

215
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,883
- Have we got any snacks?
- No!

216
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,929
And if we have to stop
every five minutes for you to puke,

217
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,473
we are never making it to the border.

(Sebastian) Things are heating up.

(Minister) Attacks are growing.

222

Both villages and peacekeepers
are under fire now.

223
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:56,686
We have casualties.
Dead and wounded.

224
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,773
- We must respond.
- I agree.

225
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,817
If we respond, we are at war.

226
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,861
We cannot risk it.

227
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:09,032
MrPresident,
if our troops cannot return fire,

228
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,159
they cannot evacuate the wounded.

229
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,829
We will maintain ceasefire
as long as we can.

230
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,749
(Chris) Mr President,
there is visual confirmation

231
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,085
of Russian tanks
amassing for an invasion.

232
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,504
I must address country
and world press tonight.

233
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,299
I think that would be
a good idea, Mr President.

234
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,051
- OK, let's do it.
- OK.

00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,772
There's local colour.

237

00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,880
'including direct aggression
by the Georgian leadership.

345
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,132
'We had to think beforehand
about how to provide

346
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:31,260
'for the security of our peacekeepers
and of Russian citizens

347
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,012
'who are residents of South Ossetia.

348
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:37,433
'We want to cooperate with all our
neighbours, with all of our partners.

349
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,643
'If anyone thinks
they can come and kill us,

'that our place is at the cemetery,

00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:45,274
'they should think what consequences
such a policy will have for them.'

352
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,610
- (Anders indistinct)
- What?

353
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,738
I said I wonder
what that will look like!

354
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:54,492
- Yeah.
- 'Wait. That's it? '

355
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:57,703
Where's the Georgian side?
No questions even?

356
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,540
Fucking unbelievable! Karin?

357
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,961
(Shouting)

358
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,637
(Sebastian) The networks
want something more personal?

359
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:33,197
Hey, Tatia! Hey, hey!
Everyone make it out OK?

360
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,449
I can't reach Sofi or my father.

361
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,451
The phones
are not working in Variani.

362
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:40,079
- Look, I mean...
- Hey.

363
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:46,043
I think you need to take five.
Come on. Let's get some air.

364
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,278
Thank you.

365
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:18,409
- So, you studied in the States?
- Yeah.

366
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,620
Where?

367
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,415
New York. Political science.

368
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,376
Thought about staying,
but came back here to teach.

369
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,466
What is this? An interview now?

370
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:40,764
OK.

371
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,351
Where's the US?

372
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:47,771
We were there for you with Iraq,
and you're nowhere to be seen.

373
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:50,441
No. I... I agree with you.

374
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,026
(Mobile rings)

375
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,531
(Speaks Georgian)

376
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:10,336
My aunt and her husband got out OK
before the army closed the roads.

377
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:14,548
She said everybody else had to go
to nearby villages for shelter, so...

378
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,759
I gotta get back up there.

379
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,596
- We're going back north.
- Really?

380
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,515
Thanks for the offer.

381
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,977
I'm gonna go to my cousin's
and see my aunt.

382
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,648
Call us later.

383
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,407
What the hell was that?

384
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,869
Seriously, man, you mind
fucking consulting me next time?

385
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,205
I don't want her coming north.
For her own good.

386
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,916
We need her. She needs us.

387
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,794
This is exactly the kind of story
the networks care about.

388
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,838
Missing family, reunion.

389
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,299
I don't want someone along
I gotta protect.

390
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,844
What, you believe
in your own reputation now?

391
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,972
Why? Because of Miriam? Giorgi?

392
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:07,393
Hey, check out this living hotness.

393
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,062
You've been the best
life insurance policy I ever got.

394
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:13,649
You are also a crazy motherfucker,
but we always come out OK.

395
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,609
And that's the way I like it.

396
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:18,362
I don't want complications
and entanglements.

397
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,700
Tatia is not Miriam.

398
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,869
Anders, you've gotta let that go.

399
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:32,000
We came here to cover a war.

400
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:35,921
If we don't get a story,
this will all unfold unseen.

401
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,636
Yeah? OK.

402
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,602
You really think this is gonna work?

403
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,521
I've seen her work bigger miracles.

404
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,902
Thank you. You know what?

405
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,405
I'm going to write you down
my numbers, OK?

406
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,618
(Wolf-whistling)

407
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,211
Thank you. See you guys.

408
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:18,630
(Cheering)

409
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,765
So, guys, mission accomplished.

410
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,559
He's gonna get in touch
with Avaliani's unit.

411
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,144
They're headed this way.

412
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,022
You're gonna need to ride with them,
or you won't get far.

413
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:38,525
The main roads are still shut down.
Checkpoints every single mile or so.

414
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,527
You're amazing!

415
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,948
You know what they say.
Everything's easier in a miniskirt.

416
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:50,412
Heard you guys had
a rough night last night. Sorry.

417
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,247
Where did you end up?

418
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:55,375
Stilton sent me to the capital
to get some... government shit.

419
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,755
20 seconds away from the Russians

420
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,882
bombing an airstrip
20 clicks from here.

421
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:05,844
Sometimes
that toothless whore is...

422
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,764
...unkind.

423
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,390
(Man) Give me the cash!

424
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,976
My name's Sebastian Ganz.

425
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:15,687
I'm trying to get a hold
of Captain Rezo Avaliani.

426
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,898
Up in the mountains.
Entertain us all.

427
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,108
Like a crazy sexy Santa Claus.

428
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,819
(Chuckles)

429
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:25,531
Listen, I just wanted to say
thank you for taking me up north.

430
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,492
And I'm sorry
I snapped at you earlier.

431
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:32,079
It's just this is all... really hard.

432
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:36,542
Sofi's wedding was supposed
to be a new beginning for all of us.

433
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:37,876
What do you mean?

434
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,296
My father and I
have never really gotten along,

435
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:44,299
and my going to America
was just one of many things.

436
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,679
His side of the family is Ossetian,

437
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:52,891
and we've had...
more fights about politics

438
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,560
than I care to remember.

439
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,312
No, listen, we're trying
to get to Variani,

440
00:30:57,438 --> 00:31:00,858
and we wondered if we might be able
to hitch a ride along with you guys.

441
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,193
We haven't spoken
to each other in years.

442
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,657
How about your family?
They must be worried sick.

443
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:11,201
No, no. I don't have one.

444
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,413
Sorry.

445
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:18,125
(Clears throat)
OK. Finally connected with Avaliani.

446
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,336
His convoy will pass here
at first light,

447
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:24,715
and we can ride with them
to about a mile from Variani.

448
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,300
But then we're on our own.

449
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:29,511
Great. Thank you. Both of you.

450
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,930
Hey, guys! The president's back on!

451
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,519
'My fellow citizens
and world leaders.

452
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:41,356
'We are facing a massive attack
by Russian forces

453
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,942
'who now control Tskhinvali.

454
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:47,154
'We have called out
to all our friends in the West,

455
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,824
'and trust that you will not allow
this aggression to continue.

456
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,745
'I have directed our Armed Forces

457
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:58,457
'from entering Georgian territory,

'and to suppress

'and all reserve officers

'May God save Georgia and all of us.'

463
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,409
Sit down.

464
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:39,456
- Think the world heard me?
- I hope so.

465
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,833
You hope so?

466
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,503
The Americans?
Bryza at the State Department?

467
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:49,800
Mr Bush has make it very clear
that they will not intervene. Can't.

468
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,551
Not militarily, anyway.

469
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:54,179
That's just what the Russians want.

470
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,598
The Americans must know
that I had no choice.

471
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,559
If I'd stood by, the Russians
would be here by now,

472
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:03,438
and my whole country would be lost!
Another Chechnya!

473
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:06,858
If the Americans won't help,
then Europe must come to our aid!

474
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,277
But someone. Someone has to come.

475
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,531
That's gonna be tough, Mr President.

476
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:16,368
Medvedev is already playing this
as a Russian 9/11.

477
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,744
Oh, please! Oh!

478
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,956
He's having press conferences
accusing your soldiers

479
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,333
of killing innocent civilians
in Tskhinvali.

480
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:26,169
- He's calling this Kosovo!
- But it's outrageous!

481
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:29,214
We did everything we could
to minimise civilian casualties

482
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,674
while defending ourselves!

483
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,847
(Sebastian) Let's try
and keep this car in one piece, eh?

484
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:40,100
Otherwise Hertz will never
rent me anything ever again.

485
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,236
It's good to see you, my friend.

486
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,614
You, too, Rezo. I wish it were
under better circumstances.

487
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,117
- Sebastian explained everything?
- Yes.

488
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,327
- Do you mind if we film?
- No.

489
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:01,913
OK.

490
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,541
Captain, this is Tatia,
whose family is missing.

491
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,085
(Speaks Georgian)
Thanks for the escort.

492
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,004
Yeah, I hope they are safe.

493
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,382
Anders, you ride with us.

494
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:15,302
Sebastian, you will follow.

495
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,262
So, what's the situation
at the front?

496
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:26,563
Our intelligence indicates that
not only the Russians are coming,

497
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:29,274
but volunteer militia and mercenaries

498
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,569
to help the Russians
cleanse the villages.

499
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:38,158
You see men with white armbands
and black masks,

500
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:40,494
you don't take pictures.

501
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,997
You don't try to hide. You run.

502
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:46,124
Understand?

503
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,675
(Tatia) Your friend, Anders,
is pretty cold.

504
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:58,845
Listen, he doesn't mean it.

505
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,681
He just has a hard time
relating to people.

506
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:05,143
You know, he's been through
some really bad shit.

507
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,104
Iraq and before.

508
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,023
But he's a good guy.

509
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,818
He cares about you and your family.

510
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,071
He just wants to keep you safe.

511
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:23,078
(Speaks Georgian)

512
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:27,624
- What's that?
- It means "God willing".

513
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,794
(Speaks broken Georgian)

514
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,674
Yes! That's good!

515
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,676
That's nice.

516
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:44,099
You know, Rezo, thank you
so much for this, but...

517
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,227
...I think I should
give it back to you.

518
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:51,106
No. I give to you for reason.

519
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:56,153
Do you know the story of St George?

520
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,989
Uh... the patron saint of soldiers.

521
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:02,742
Yes. His image is in all churches.

522
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,412
He was a Roman soldier

523
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:09,916
martyred for refusing
to abandon the truth.

524
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:14,254
You were trying
to tell the truth in Iraq.

525

(Speaks Georgian)

526
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:26,016

God be with you, my friend.

00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,479
Thank you.

(Sighs)

531
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:24,658

(Speaks Georgian)

533
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:29,579
What's she saying?

534
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:32,624
She thinks she can help us.
She wants to see the pictures.

536
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:39,631

537
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,967
What are they saying?
What did they say?

538
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:46,221
Her cousin owns an inn in Avnevi,
5km from here,

539
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:49,641
and he took in a bride
seeking shelter.

540
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,685
A bride and her father.

542
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,711

548
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,250

552
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,886

- Jets! Jets!

553
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,534
(Baby cries)

554
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,421
(Radar beeping)

555
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,011
Guys, we need
to get to a shelter. Now!

556
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,190
We do not have much down here,

557
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:04,275
but you are welcome to have it.

558
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,653

all across the country.

564
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:36,599

to block our ports.

565
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:39,436
- My God.
- (Anders) We leave at first light.

566
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:43,022
Avaliani told me volunteer militia
are coming with the Russians.

567
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:46,025
We should try to get some rest.

568

00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:06,267
He said he wants
the chief of police and the mayor.

587

No! We have to do something!

592
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,959
There's nothing we can do.

593
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,295
They'll kill us all!

594
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,866

the fuck out of here, Sebastian.

599
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,532
Just one sec.

600
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,619
Clear them out!

601
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,249

What are you doing in Avnevi,
Mr Anders and Mr Ganz?

652
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:44,058
We were filming
in a neighbouring village

- Mm-hm.

665
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,629
I can make the women talk.

666
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:58,007
You will not touch my daughters!

667
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:01,886
They are Ossetians like me.

We are like you.

669
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:06,807
I am a Cossack, old man.

670

And the next time
you raise your voice at me,

671
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:14,940
I will cut you open
while your daughters watch.

676
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,998
If there is a video recording,
we have to find it.

We don't need a PR nightmare
like the Americans in Iraq.

Don't worry, we'll find it.

679
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:42,009
Sir, we just received word that
the second invasion front has launched.

680
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,469
Good.

681
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:48,265
(Minister) Mr President, we now face
a massive assault on two fronts.

682
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:51,769
We estimate the total size
of the Russian force at 40,000 men.

683
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,771
More than three times
than our own army.

684
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:58,734
- How long can they hold?
- We cannot fight a two-front war.

685
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:03,697
Our troops in Abkhazia must retreat,
or they will be wiped out.

686
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:07,201
(President) Pull them back.

687
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:09,995
What's the news, Christopher?

688
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:14,083
Any news from the Americans
on our ceasefire proposal?

689
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:20,547
I was told that President Bush spoke
to Medvedev and Putin personally.

690
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:24,927
They're not interested.

691
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:29,390
Putin left Beijing yesterday and said
he would command this personally.

692
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:33,352
He told Sarkozy he would not quit
until I am hanged by my balls!

693
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,273
There is some good news.

694
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:40,401
The EU ministers have agreed
to an emergency meeting.

695
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:44,363

An emergency meeting! Oh!

696
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:48,284
Oh, let's bring cocktails!
Champagne! Let's celebrate(!)

697
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:52,288
Meetings. More meetings! And
more meetings. No more meetings!

698
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:56,333
Every time some people sit
in meetings, more of our people die!

699
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,671
The EU representatives
have to come here!

700
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,423
They have to stand with us!

701
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,723
What did you do with the real card?

702
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,434
It's in the ground where you fell
after that guy hit you.

703
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,020
I buried it
when I came over to help you.

704
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:22,359
I swapped the cards in the orchard.
We have to get that footage out.

705
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,740
Papa, are you alright?
Did they hurt you?

706
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,950
I'm alright, I'm alright.

707
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:33,954
(Daniil speaks Georgian)

708
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:52,639
(Door slams and locks shut)

709
00:55:58,438 --> 00:55:59,855
Hey! Anders!

710
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:02,358
Hey, where are you taking him?
Sebastian!

711
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:08,155
Beautiful church.

712
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:13,702
Do you know that Georgia has some
of the oldest churches in the world?

713
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:21,668
At least they will be left
when this is over.

714
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:27,049
My leaders in Moscow
have decided they don't want to risk

715
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:30,135
the church's condemnation
of this project.

716
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:42,064
Do you play?

717
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,666
(Tatia) In English.

718
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,709
Are you sure they didn't hurt you?

719
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:05,170
Yes, yes.

720
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:08,048
So, what did they do to you?
You were gone a long time.

721
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:14,763
You didn't tell them anything,
did you?

722
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:17,307
Oh, Christ!

723
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:23,730
This board was a gift from my son,
Sasha. He died in Afghanistan.

724
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:52,217
Not bad, Mr Anders. Not bad.

725
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:58,265
My Sasha was only 21
when he was killed.

726
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:02,019
He was captured by enemy soldiers.

727
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:05,272
You can imagine the things
they did to him.

728
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:08,150
That doesn't excuse
what you did here.

729
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,570
Of course it doesn't.

730
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:15,866
I just say so...
you know I understand.

731
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:18,452
Understand what?

732
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,746
That look in your eyes.

733
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:23,499
The emptiness that comes
from burying your family.

734
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:56,949
You lost your parents.
Car accident, wasn't it?

735
00:58:57,075 --> 00:59:00,118
Drunk driver. Head-on collision.

736
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:05,123
You know what is interesting?

737
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:11,964
That we both asked for combat
after family death.

738
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,927
And if people asked us,

739
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:21,807
I'm sure we'd give them many reasons
for why we did it.

740
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,561
But if we are honest...

741
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:36,738
...I think we just sought noise,

742
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:40,033
to drown out all other thoughts.

743
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:43,579
To forget.

744
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:47,833
Then after a while, in that noise,

745
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:51,461
you start to feel... immune.

746
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:55,841
Am I right?

747
00:59:55,967 --> 01:00:02,681
Unfortunately, such an attitude
makes one prone to taking risks.

748
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:05,058
Really careless sometimes.

749
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:12,065
Like accepting
a Shiite cleric's invitation

750
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:16,069
for an interview,
driving straight into a deadly trap.

751
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:19,364
- You shut your mouth.
- What?

752
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:23,493
You feel your privacy
has been invaded?

753
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:27,831
But isn't that what you do?

754
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:31,293
Capture people
at their most vulnerable?

755
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:34,087
Enough!

756
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:39,676
(Daniil) Russia hires us, because
their own army is not motivated.

757
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:45,307
They pay us well for... special jobs.

758
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:55,942
Like, we catch deserters sometimes.

759
01:00:57,236 --> 01:01:00,238
The lucky ones would get trial.

760
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,159
But the worst men...

761
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:11,083
...they give to me.

762
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,169
How could you have told them?

763
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:16,463
They will kill them now! All of us!

764
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:20,300
They already know everything.

765
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:22,386
Where is the recording? Tell me!

766
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:26,223
I don't know!

767
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,934
Tatia, do not play games with me!

768
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:32,229
These men may be Ossetians,

769
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,898
but they will not wait forever.

770
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:38,902
Tell me the location
of the memory card,

771
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:41,071
and I will let you all go.

772
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:42,823
You have my word.

773
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:45,492
I don't know
what you're talking about.

774
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:48,578
(Chuckles) Let's not do that.

775
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:51,081
Your friend doesn't have
that kind of time.

776
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:53,125
What are you doing to him?

777
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,758
May I begin, Colonel?

778
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:03,552
Hold on.

779
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,599
We must think of ourselves now.

780
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,685
Not two strangers!

781
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:16,523
You think they wouldn't leave us?
They will abandon us like the world has!

782
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:21,153
Tatia, tell me where the recording is?

783
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:24,322
You Americans!

784
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:27,200
Saakashvili started this war!

785
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:29,703
You understand?

786
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:33,582
We are here just to protect
our people in South Ossetia!

787
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:36,960
I can't give a fuck who you think
you're trying to protect!

788
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:42,215
But I would love to know how shooting
an old woman helps you to do it.

789
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:48,346
I'm only a soldier.
I have my orders.

790
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:51,558
Georgia already lost this war.

791
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:58,774
(Gunshots)

792
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:06,323
(Soldier speaking Georgian)

793
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:10,160
(Speaks Georgian)

794
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,083
(Shouting)

795
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,463
- You didn't listen to me.
- How the hell did you?

796
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:24,758
We had to fall back.
Then we heard the attack here.

797
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:27,302
- They got Sebastian.
- Yes. We are on it.

798
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:30,222
And they got Tatia and her family.

799
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:33,058
- Which way?
- The jail in the basement.

800
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:36,019
(Soldiers shouting in Georgian)

801
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:39,523
(Gunshots)

802
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:10,720
(Speaks Georgian)

803
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,306
- Are you all right, bucko?
- Yeah.

804
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:14,474
Yeah?

805
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:18,270
(Gunshots)

806
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:20,480
We can use them as shields!

807
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:26,736
Keys!

808
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:31,741
You came back!

809
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,243
- Yeah. You hurt?
- No.

810
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:34,661
OK. Let's go.

811
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:35,620
Tatia!

812
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:39,291
No, I can't trust you.

813
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:42,419
Tatia, I'm your father...

814
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:45,130
They need my help.

815
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:51,636
No. You'll be safer with your friends.

816
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:55,974
(Groans)

817
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:58,476
Medic!

818
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:03,773
- Are you okay?
- It's nothing... just my arm.

819
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,609
Medic I said!

820
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:08,695
Get them!

821
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:19,372
You stay close to me.

822
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:41,353
Get the vehicles started!

823
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:55,283
(Grunts)

824
01:05:55,409 --> 01:05:57,494
(Gunshots)

825
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:59,537
(Shouting in Georgian)

826
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:04,459
(Speaks in Georgian)

827
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:09,130
We need to get the memory card!

828
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:11,383
I know!

829
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:19,766
Cover us!

830
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,268
Come on! Get in!

831
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:23,228
(Grunts)

832
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:25,021
Get in! Quickly!

833
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:40,704
Tank coming, Captain!

834
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,540
- Captain!
- I know!

835
01:06:50,214 --> 01:06:52,799
(Engine revving)

836
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:39,471
Stay down!

837
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:50,023
I have to get out!
We have evidence of a war crime!

838
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:52,525
Meet you where the road
comes around the orchard!

839
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:54,486
(Avaliani mutters)

840
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:56,821
(Grunts)

841
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:03,036
That guy's crazy.

842
01:08:20,554 --> 01:08:22,138
(Shouting)

843
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:27,018
(Grunts)

844
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,125
(Tatia screams)

845
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:16,025
Slow down! Slow down!

846
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:18,987
Come on! Come on!

847
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:20,864
- Did you get the memory card?
- Yeah.

848
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:26,244
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

849
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:28,121
We're almost out.

850
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:37,714
Papa!

851
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,007
Get down!

852
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:40,091
(Grunts)

853
01:09:43,053 --> 01:09:44,804
(Gunshot)

854
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,220
(Gunshots and cheering)

855
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:17,146
Medvedev has refused
new peace proposals.

856
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:19,148
Which parts?

857
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,775
All of them.

858
01:11:20,901 --> 01:11:24,654
He told Sarkozy that
they have their own demands.

859
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:28,908
- What possible demands?
- They're sending them over tomorrow.

860
01:11:29,034 --> 01:11:33,079
I am reinstating
unilateral ceasefire.

861
01:11:33,205 --> 01:11:36,332
- Mr President...
- All our troops, ceasefire.

862
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:40,586
Fall back to Tbilisi.
We must defend our capital.

863
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:45,174
If the world does not respond
to this gesture, it is suicide!

864
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,969
It is the only chance
we have for survival.

865
01:12:00,899 --> 01:12:03,609
(Avaliani)
We should reach Gori by noon.

866
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:06,195
It is the nearest city
with broadcast centre.

867
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:11,492
Isn't there a faster route?
We need to get this footage out now.

868
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,954
No. We must stay off road.

869
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:16,182
I'm... sorry for your loss.

870
01:13:19,269 --> 01:13:21,687
I don't mean to offend. It's...

871
01:13:22,981 --> 01:13:27,693
It's just I've lost
many people in my life.

872
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:36,285
But I believe that
all the trials that we face...

873
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:40,456
...lead us to our purpose.

874
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,545
Thank you.

875
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:55,847
What do you believe, Anders?

876
01:14:04,314 --> 01:14:05,857
I don't know.

877
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:08,836
You're abandoning your post?

878
01:15:08,962 --> 01:15:10,963
By order of the President.

879
01:15:11,089 --> 01:15:13,090
All troops are to fall back

880
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:16,552
and report to defend Tbilisi.

881
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:19,305
Gori is going to fall.

882
01:15:19,431 --> 01:15:23,142
I'm sorry. I have my orders.

883
01:15:23,268 --> 01:15:25,144
What did he say?

884
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:29,023
- They're abandoning the city.
- We've got to get in there!

885
01:15:29,149 --> 01:15:31,734
- What do you wanna do?
- I will not run.

886
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:34,737
I will not lose my country!

887
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:37,865
I've fought in too many wars
to keep Georgia free.

888
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:44,830
(Helicopter whirring drowns speech)

889
01:16:22,452 --> 01:16:23,786
(Speaks Georgian)

890
01:16:46,643 --> 01:16:50,313
- Which way to the broadcast centre?
- That way! East!

891
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:09,373
I'm sorry. We must leave you here.

892
01:17:09,499 --> 01:17:13,252
I need to attempt a defence. As soon
as you can, you must leave the city.

893
01:17:13,378 --> 01:17:16,839
It will become very dangerous.

894
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:19,967
- Take care, Rezo.
- God be with you.

895
01:17:26,183 --> 01:17:28,059
- (Anders) You got the card?
- Yeah.

896
01:17:28,185 --> 01:17:30,269
First, we need an upload code

897
01:17:30,395 --> 01:17:32,563
from a network willing
to accept the footage.

898
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:37,151
Shit! They've gone!

899
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:42,198
(Sighs)

900
01:17:43,617 --> 01:17:47,328
- What do we do now?
- We need a phone.

901
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:56,796
- 'International operator.'
- A collect call to the USA.

902
01:17:56,922 --> 01:17:58,464
I need to eat something.

903
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:02,635
Hey! I got water!

904
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:04,345
- Hey, Karin.
- 'Thank God! '

905
01:18:04,471 --> 01:18:07,640
- You guys all right?
- 'Yeah. We're in Gori.'

906
01:18:08,433 --> 01:18:09,850
Gori? It's been bombed!

907
01:18:09,976 --> 01:18:12,144
- I know.
- 'You need to get out.'

908
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:13,312
Got coins!

909
01:18:13,438 --> 01:18:16,649
No. We have something we need
to upload. I need a network!

910
01:18:16,775 --> 01:18:19,860
- The Russians are likely to take...
- 'Karin, I know! Listen to me! '

911
01:18:19,986 --> 01:18:22,780
We witnessed something.
Killings. Executions in a village.

912
01:18:22,906 --> 01:18:25,241
Sebastian got it all on tape.
We have to get it out.

913
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:28,035
- 'Now.'
- Yeah, but how?

914
01:18:28,161 --> 01:18:32,790
There's a media centre building here
with a satellite upload capability.

915
01:18:32,916 --> 01:18:36,335
We can get in,
but we need for a network

916
01:18:36,461 --> 01:18:39,672
to accept the feed
and give us... an access code.

917
01:18:39,798 --> 01:18:42,717
She'd better hurry!
The bombing's winding down.

918
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:45,511
Which means the ground troops
are getting ready.

919
01:18:45,637 --> 01:18:47,430
- You hear that?
- 'Yeah, but Anders... '

920
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:51,267
I have already tried everyone.
No one cares.

921
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:55,938
'But I'll try Roger McTierney.
If anyone can get it on, it's him.'

922
01:18:56,064 --> 01:18:57,732
Yeah, yeah. OK.

923
01:19:00,527 --> 01:19:01,986
Here.

924
01:19:03,572 --> 01:19:05,865
Give me those coins.
Let's try the Dutchman.

925
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:07,116
Yeah.

926
01:19:28,221 --> 01:19:29,472
Friendlies!

927
01:19:31,224 --> 01:19:32,767
Hold your fire!

928
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:42,902
Have you seen ground troops?

929
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:45,029
Hear that?

930
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:50,618
The bombing's stopped.

931
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:53,746
Defensive positions!

932
01:19:53,872 --> 01:19:55,331
Move out!

933
01:19:56,374 --> 01:19:57,249
(Phone rings)

934
01:19:57,375 --> 01:19:59,835
- Karin?
- 'He won't do it.'

935
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:01,003
Fuck!

936
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:04,507
All right. Thanks for trying, anyway.

937
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:08,511
- 'What are you gonna do now? '
- I don't know.

938
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:10,638
(Explosion)

939
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:12,264
Fuck!

940
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:14,767
We're OK. I'll call you once... Karin?

941
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:16,560
(Phone line buzzing)

942
01:20:19,356 --> 01:20:23,067
- (Sebastian) Now what?
- We've gotta leave town. Come on.

943
01:20:27,864 --> 01:20:29,949
(Explosions in the distance)

944
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:39,041
Whoa!

945
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:41,961
Jesus!

946
01:20:43,588 --> 01:20:45,256
Let's go! Come on!

947
01:20:52,556 --> 01:20:54,431
They're doing a final sweep.

948
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:59,937
We've got to find shelter
before the ground troops get here!

949
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:08,279
Fuck!

950
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:12,825
(Laughs)
Hey! So glad you guys didn't die!

951
01:21:12,951 --> 01:21:14,451
How are you?

952
01:21:14,578 --> 01:21:16,287
Hey! How did you find us?

953
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:18,789
Your message.
I tried calling you back.

954
01:21:18,915 --> 01:21:20,833
- You still need a SAT upload?
- Yeah.

955
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:23,544
I got one. Stilton and I have
an upload vehicle. Come on.

956
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:26,505
I would've driven it here,
but I didn't feel like blowing up.

957
01:21:26,631 --> 01:21:30,467
Listen, I need you
to sit this one out, OK?

958
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:34,305
- Anders, I can take care of myself.
- Well, we can't risk this. Please!

959
01:21:34,431 --> 01:21:36,265
Where am I gonna be safer?

960
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:38,267
My station will take yours. Come on!

961
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:40,185
Hold on. We've got to make a detour.

962
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:42,605
Demidov told me
they spared the churches, so...

963
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:44,857
Everybody, get close. Get close.

964
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:46,901
- Now be happy.
- For fuck's sake!

965
01:21:47,027 --> 01:21:49,612
It's only a war.

966
01:21:59,205 --> 01:22:00,539
(Speaks Georgian)

967
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:20,225
Anders... I don't like this at all.

968
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:25,147
Would you do it for me?

969
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:29,610
We'll come right back and then
we can all leave the city together.

970
01:22:29,736 --> 01:22:31,111
Fine.

971
01:22:31,237 --> 01:22:33,030
Thank you.

972
01:22:33,156 --> 01:22:35,908
How do I get in touch with you
if something happens?

973
01:22:47,337 --> 01:22:49,630
That's Dutchman's cell. Tell these...

974
01:22:50,882 --> 01:22:53,592
Ask these people
if anybody has a cell phone.

975
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:57,596
(Speaks Georgian)

976
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:09,024
OK. What's the number?

977
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:11,318
There.

978
01:23:11,444 --> 01:23:14,738
I'll call you on this phone
as soon as the upload is done, OK?

979
01:23:14,864 --> 01:23:16,740
OK.

980
01:23:18,702 --> 01:23:20,327
You know, I hope...

981
01:23:21,204 --> 01:23:23,580
- Anders, come on! Let's go!
- Come on!

982
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:45,477
(Camera shutter clicks)

983
01:23:49,774 --> 01:23:51,859
(Gunshots)

984
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:59,950
I can't reach Stilton.
The signal keeps coming in and out.

985
01:24:07,834 --> 01:24:10,210
Stilton!

986
01:24:11,337 --> 01:24:13,464
- What's up?
- Zoe's with him.

987
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:17,801
She knows what she's doing.

988
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:21,638
(Dutchman) Align the dish!

989
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:24,266
Link us back up! Hurry!

990
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:26,185
(Anders) Wake up, Romeo!

991
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:29,396
It's all we got. The people have got
to see this footage! Now!

992
01:24:29,522 --> 01:24:30,773
Here.

993
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,817
Hope it still works.

994
01:24:33,943 --> 01:24:35,694
(Gunshots)

995
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:38,238
- Data's intact.
- Oh, yes!

996
01:24:38,364 --> 01:24:40,908
How long for the uplink?

997
01:24:41,034 --> 01:24:43,535
- Come on.
- About two minutes to transmit.

998
01:24:43,661 --> 01:24:46,497
- Can I offer you a drink?
- I'll wait till the footage is out.

999
01:24:46,623 --> 01:24:49,374
But I will take a cigarette.

1000
01:25:20,198 --> 01:25:22,324
(Beeping)

1001
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:29,289
They've targeted us!
Get under cover! Go!

1002
01:25:29,415 --> 01:25:31,375
Go, go, go!

1003
01:25:31,501 --> 01:25:33,836
- What are you doing?
- Saving our footage. Go!

1004
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:41,426
- (Sebastian) Almost there!
- Gotta go!

1005
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:43,428
(Anders) Come on!

1006
01:25:44,430 --> 01:25:45,973
Come on!

1007
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:48,851
- Get out!
- Come on! Come on!

1008
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:50,811
- We're not gonna make it!
- Get out!

1009
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:02,990
Get up now! Come on!

1010
01:26:16,921 --> 01:26:18,213
(Speaks Georgian)

1011
01:26:41,779 --> 01:26:43,906
(Cheering)

1012
01:26:55,793 --> 01:26:57,711
(Anders) Dutchman? Stilton?

1013
01:26:59,797 --> 01:27:01,423
Sebastian!

1014
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:07,596
It's bad, isn't it?

1015
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:09,514
I can't feel shit!

1016
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:11,141
You're OK.

1017
01:27:11,267 --> 01:27:12,559
Hey.

1018
01:27:13,603 --> 01:27:14,895
(Chuckles)

1019
01:27:16,356 --> 01:27:17,397
(Gunshots)

1020
01:27:17,523 --> 01:27:20,317
Oh, fuck. Shit.

1021
01:27:20,443 --> 01:27:23,612
- Go, go.
- I'm not leaving you.

1022
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:25,405
- You have to go.
- I can help you.

1023
01:27:25,531 --> 01:27:29,326
No, no, no. Listen to me.
You need to go. Now.

1024
01:27:29,452 --> 01:27:33,538
- I'm not fucking leaving you!
- Shut the fuck up, OK?

1025
01:27:33,665 --> 01:27:35,666
I can't move.

1026
01:27:36,626 --> 01:27:38,669
You have to get our footage out.

1027
01:27:39,754 --> 01:27:43,507
Go back to that church.
Hide the card until it's safe.

1028
01:27:43,633 --> 01:27:45,592
I'll be fine.

1029
01:27:45,718 --> 01:27:48,762
Life insurance policy. Remember?

1030
01:27:54,352 --> 01:27:56,270
Listen, you have to do this for me.

1031
01:27:57,272 --> 01:28:00,190
Promise me. Promise me
you'll get the footage out.

1032
01:28:00,316 --> 01:28:01,942
- Promise me!
- I promise!

1033
01:28:02,068 --> 01:28:04,027
(Gunshots)

1034
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:09,783
Here. Take this.

1035
01:28:11,661 --> 01:28:13,120
I'm coming right back.

1036
01:28:13,246 --> 01:28:14,705
Go!

1037
01:28:27,176 --> 01:28:29,052
Tatia?

1038
01:28:30,054 --> 01:28:32,848
Tatia? Where is the girl I was with?

1039
01:28:33,474 --> 01:28:36,768
Come on, guys. Somebody must know.
Where is the girl I was with?

1040
01:28:37,729 --> 01:28:39,730
Where's the girl?
There was a girl with me.

1041
01:28:39,856 --> 01:28:43,108
I don't need a phone this time.
I need the girl I was with.

1042
01:28:43,234 --> 01:28:44,484
Remember the girl?

1043
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:48,530
Oh, Jesus.

1044
01:28:51,451 --> 01:28:52,909
(Mobile rings)

1045
01:28:55,038 --> 01:28:58,081
- 'If you have hurt her... '
- Come to the Stalin Square.

1046
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:00,792
Bring the memory card.

1047
01:29:43,294 --> 01:29:45,545
I need you to do something
very important for me.

1048
01:29:45,671 --> 01:29:48,256
Do you understand? OK.

1049
01:30:36,889 --> 01:30:39,099
Did you bring what I wanted?

1050
01:30:47,233 --> 01:30:48,775
Let her go.

1051
01:31:00,913 --> 01:31:02,247
Thank God!

1052
01:31:02,373 --> 01:31:04,416
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1053
01:31:04,542 --> 01:31:06,918
I thought I'd never see you again.

1054
01:31:09,797 --> 01:31:12,549
Did you make the broadcast?

1055
01:31:12,675 --> 01:31:14,217
No.

1056
01:31:15,803 --> 01:31:17,053
Sebastian?

1057
01:31:19,599 --> 01:31:20,849
(Sighs) No.

1058
01:31:22,268 --> 01:31:23,560
(Sobs)

1059
01:31:23,686 --> 01:31:25,604
Everything will be OK.

1060
01:31:31,402 --> 01:31:33,612
I would have liked
to know you better.

1061
01:31:34,906 --> 01:31:37,032
I don't understand.

1062
01:31:37,742 --> 01:31:39,951
Now I need you to run.

1063
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:44,789
- Anders...
- Go. Go.

1064
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:54,674
Go!

1065
01:32:24,288 --> 01:32:27,374
The code is 1216.

1066
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:36,216
You missed a card
when you searched me Avnevi.

1067
01:32:36,342 --> 01:32:38,635
The real one's on its way
to a human rights group,

1068
01:32:38,761 --> 01:32:41,304
courtesy of a brave little girl.

1069
01:32:43,349 --> 01:32:44,975
It's over.

1070
01:32:50,773 --> 01:32:52,983
And how did you think
you could survive this?

1071
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:55,485
I didn't.

1072
01:33:17,758 --> 01:33:19,217
(Gunshot)

1073
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:53,501
I thought I told you to run!

1074
01:34:31,624 --> 01:34:34,084
I wanna see him
one last time, OK?

1075
01:35:02,279 --> 01:35:03,988
This...

1076
01:35:04,657 --> 01:35:06,741
This is where I left him.

1077
01:35:07,868 --> 01:35:09,744
I fucking left him.

1078
01:35:38,649 --> 01:35:40,817
(Shouting)

1079
01:35:40,943 --> 01:35:42,986
Anders!

1080
01:35:47,575 --> 01:35:51,161
- Hey, Rezo!
- We need your help.

1081
01:35:51,287 --> 01:35:52,537
- OK.
- Right.

1082
01:35:52,663 --> 01:35:55,165
- Anders.
- Sebastian?

1083
01:35:56,208 --> 01:35:59,502
Sebastian! What the fuck?

1084
01:35:59,628 --> 01:36:02,589
- I played dead.
- Are you OK?

1085
01:36:03,507 --> 01:36:05,383
- Can we move you?
- Yeah.

1086
01:36:05,509 --> 01:36:07,260
Let's get him out of here.

1087
01:36:07,386 --> 01:36:08,470
(Speaks Georgian)

1088
01:36:14,101 --> 01:36:15,977
- You all right, bucko?
- Yeah.

1089
01:36:37,249 --> 01:36:40,543
Hold on, we gotta stop.
Put him down.

1090
01:36:52,681 --> 01:36:55,683
Don't resist, Captain.

1091
01:37:16,539 --> 01:37:18,915
- Anders?
- There's nowhere to run.

1092
01:37:19,041 --> 01:37:21,125
Even if we could.

1093
01:37:44,567 --> 01:37:46,568
Sir, they're not resisting.

1094
01:38:05,921 --> 01:38:08,423
(Speaks Georgian)

1095
01:38:30,029 --> 01:38:32,906
Get away from here!

1096
01:38:36,827 --> 01:38:37,869
Go!

1097
01:38:41,790 --> 01:38:44,334
There's been enough killing.

1098
01:39:06,774 --> 01:39:08,858
(Cheering and applause)

1099
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:33,174
Today the forces of occupation
have gathered at our gates.

1100
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:35,385
(Jeering and booing)

1101
01:39:38,389 --> 01:39:41,975
And we know that this empire
is very powerful.

1102
01:39:42,101 --> 01:39:45,103
They have lots of tanks.
They have lots of planes.

1103
01:39:46,438 --> 01:39:50,316
But we have something
that is more precious.

1104
01:39:50,442 --> 01:39:54,195
We have the love for freedom, and
we have the love for independence!

1105
01:39:54,321 --> 01:39:56,406
(Cheering)

1106
01:39:56,532 --> 01:40:00,034
We stand here today
as one proud independent nation.

1107
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:02,745
Just like the Finns,
just like the Czechs,

1108
01:40:02,871 --> 01:40:05,331
and just like
the Hungarians before us.

1109
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:11,129
And we tell them today,
in front of the whole world,

1110
01:40:11,255 --> 01:40:14,882
that freedom will not retreat,
freedom will not surrender!

1111
01:40:16,385 --> 01:40:19,554
We may be besieged,
but we are not alone.

1112
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:24,559
Standing with us here tonight
are six European presidents

1113
01:40:24,685 --> 01:40:27,103
who have travelled
thousands of miles

1114
01:40:27,229 --> 01:40:29,313
in defiance of fear and threats!

1115
01:40:31,316 --> 01:40:33,276
These six men are here

1116
01:40:33,402 --> 01:40:35,737
because they know
the issue of independence

1117
01:40:35,863 --> 01:40:38,197
is being decided here tonight!

1118
01:40:38,323 --> 01:40:40,408
(Cheering)

1119
01:40:42,119 --> 01:40:47,540
May God bless the Georgian people!
Long live a free Georgia!

1120
01:40:47,666 --> 01:40:49,751
(Cheering)

1121
01:40:54,965 --> 01:40:58,009
Georgia! Georgia! Georgia!

1122
01:41:03,015 --> 01:41:05,099
(Chanting continues)

1123
01:41:18,614 --> 01:41:20,907
(Church bells ringing)

1124
01:41:21,033 --> 01:41:23,284
They say you're gonna
make a full recovery.

1125
01:41:23,410 --> 01:41:27,413
Yeah? Six months!

1126
01:41:27,539 --> 01:41:31,501
And... our footage?

1127
01:41:31,627 --> 01:41:34,837
It's out. Human Rights Watch has it.

1128
01:41:34,963 --> 01:41:38,466
It's getting a lot of hits and
people are starting to pay attention.

1129
01:41:40,010 --> 01:41:42,053
Not bad for a loose cannon.

1130
01:41:42,846 --> 01:41:44,597
Thanks, bucko.

1131
01:41:44,723 --> 01:41:48,017
'Despite the ceasefire
and pledges to withdraw,

1132
01:41:48,143 --> 01:41:51,229
'the Russian troops and tanks
remain in Gori,

1133
01:41:51,355 --> 01:41:53,689

'and nothing but stories

'More than 100,000 people
have lost their homes...

'People keep asking me
how can this still be happening... '

1143
01:42:17,131 --> 01:42:20,174
An estimated 50,000 people
were made homeless,

1144

their villages permanently
destroyed or occupied.

1145

Many still live in refugee camps.

1146

Despite demands from Europe
and the United States to withdraw,

1147
01:42:33,564 --> 01:42:36,274
the regions of South Ossetia
and Abkhazia remain occupied

1148
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,401
by Russian forces.

1149

This nation is right now
fighting for its survival.

Georgia continues its quest
to integrate with the West.

'This is Thomas Anders
reporting in Georgia.'

My husband, Mikheil Taboshvili.
Killed in Eredvi village.

My mother, Natalia Okropiridze.

1156
01:43:10,642 --> 01:43:16,230
As my parents were being evacuated
and they were crossing the road,

1157
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:23,571
a mine exploded in front of their car and
shrapnel hit her straight in the temple.

1158
01:43:23,697 --> 01:43:26,449
She died on the spot.

1159
01:43:29,286 --> 01:43:31,120

Our grandmother.

1162
01:43:35,042 --> 01:43:38,586
My parents were tortured.
Their throats were slit.

1163
01:43:41,548 --> 01:43:46,469
They were buried in our backyard,
and that's all we know.

1164
01:43:48,305 --> 01:43:51,098
This is Nodar Otiashvili, my father.

1165
01:43:52,434 --> 01:43:56,520
We used to live
in Kvemo Achabeti village.

1166
01:43:58,982 --> 01:44:01,192
I am the son of Socrate Gogidze.

1167
01:44:02,819 --> 01:44:07,490
I was told by the Red Cross

1168
01:44:07,616 --> 01:44:09,867
that he was buried in our garden.

1169
01:44:13,038 --> 01:44:14,914
He had been hanged.

I am Marina Kakhbiashvili.
I used to live in Kehvi village.

1171

On August 8th, we left.

1172
01:44:27,803 --> 01:44:31,472
My husband stayed there.
My son and my husband.

1173
01:44:31,598 --> 01:44:35,685
My son left that night.
My husband stayed in the house.

1174

Ekaterine Papelishvili, my grandmother.
