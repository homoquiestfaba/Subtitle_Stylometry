1
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:04,957
- Everything's gonna be
all right, I promise.

2
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,296
Just breathe, there ya go.

3
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,031
- Everything's
gonna be all right.

4
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:13,365
- Thank you Mom and dad.

5
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:15,166
Did you hear that? Mom and--

6
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,280
- So, it's Christmas Eve,

7
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:30,583
couple hours away from
being one year sober.

8
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:34,287
And it's also gonna be
my first Christmas...

9
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,391
Without, um...

10
00:02:41,763 --> 00:02:42,962
Yeah, fuck it.

11
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:22,702
- SURPRISE!

12
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:24,036
- Congratulations.

13
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:27,272
- Congratulations to you.
No more drugs no more booze

14
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:30,475
- We had to do something
before you skip town,

15
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,377
- So this is, congratulations,

16
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,314
good luck, and
Christmas, all in one!

17
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,891
- Hello?

18
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,392
- Come on, say something.

19
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,627
- Speech, speech!

20
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,763
- Who works at an ice
rink in Florida?!

21
00:03:50,765 --> 00:03:51,964
- Psychopaths.

22
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:53,032
- meth-heads

23
00:03:53,034 --> 00:03:54,635
- Yeah, drug addicts.

24
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:59,004
- Everything is
going to be all right.

25
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:00,407
Breathe.

26
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:06,846
You are in control of
your breath and your life.

27
00:04:06,848 --> 00:04:10,348
Remember you are exactly
where you need to be.

28
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,886
Allow all of the thoughts
and burdens of the world

29
00:04:13,888 --> 00:04:15,755
to be free from your mind.

30
00:04:15,757 --> 00:04:17,056
Remember.

31
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:22,462
- Even if your thoughts
wander that's okay too.

32
00:04:26,134 --> 00:04:29,034
- Just focus
on your breath.

33
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:30,004
In.

34
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,076
And out.

35
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:38,677
In.

36
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:39,647
And out.

37
00:04:40,882 --> 00:04:45,251
Keep breathing
slowly like this.

38
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:49,590
Fully empty your lungs
with each breath.

39
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:51,791
You are in control-

40
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,130
- Hey, Angel, Angel, Angel.

41
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:32,631
Come here.

42
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:33,601
Come here.

43
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:44,043
Babies, babies, babies.

44
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:44,910
Hey.

45
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:45,746
Hey.

46
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:48,013
Hey.

47
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:48,981
Hey.

48
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:49,784
Hi.

49
00:05:51,052 --> 00:05:52,119
Hi, come here.

50
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:55,921
Come here.

51
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:57,156
Come on.

52
00:05:57,158 --> 00:05:58,023
Come on.

53
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:32,960
- Okay. You ready?

54
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:35,096
Here we go.

55
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:39,497
Okay, wanna get a treat?

56
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:40,532
That's a girl.

57
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:42,136
Oh, that's delicious, thank you.

58
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:46,774
Well, it's Christmas Eve,

59
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:50,410
couple hours away from
being one year sober.

60
00:06:52,046 --> 00:06:54,414
And it's also gonna be
my first Christmas...

61
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:56,550
Without, um...

62
00:06:58,152 --> 00:06:59,419
Yeah, fuck it.

63
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:06,659
You wanna go watch a show
about lions and shit?

64
00:07:06,661 --> 00:07:08,560
- It's been days

65
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:11,297
since the lions have found water

66
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:12,430
and time,

67
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,464
is running-

68
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:14,900
- Aww Jingle bells

69
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:17,002
- I guess I'll be alone this
Christmas...

70
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:18,070
- No you won't!

71
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:19,171
We can spend it together.

72
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:21,006
Christmas can be saved!

73
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:22,608
- Yay!

74
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,778
- You don't even give a shit.

75
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:26,512
- Looks like
they WON'T be home alone

76
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:27,746
this Christmas.

77
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:29,248
- Kids. I'm home.

78
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,549
- Daddy!

79
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:32,184
- Fly with
Speed Fast Airlines

80
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:33,686
and go higher than ever before.

81
00:07:33,688 --> 00:07:34,855
- Let me see this girl.

82
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:48,667
- Ready to go to bed?

83
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,502
- Hey, you've
reached Briana, leave a message

84
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:52,738
and I'll get right
back to you, ciao!

85
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,208
- Hey it's Dylan, I
just wanted to call

86
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,843
and say Merry Christmas.

87
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:59,477
I'm at one year sober today

88
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,080
and uh...

89
00:08:01,082 --> 00:08:02,247
well, I don't know.

90
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:03,782
Technically I didn't,

91
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:05,584
I'm not gonna get it for like
another hour and 40 minutes,

92
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:07,487
but even I can't
fuck that up. Right?

93
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:10,191
I miss you guys.

94
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:13,060
Merry Christmas.

95
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:15,661
- You
have no new messages.

96
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:17,329
To listen to your old messages

97
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,732
from people that you have
pushed away, please press-

98
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:21,867
Hi baby boy it's mom.

99
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:24,038
Just calling to see how your
day is going. Love you.

100
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:25,637
- I miss you, man.

101
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,439
I've been meaning to reach out.

102
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:29,108
I want to hear what's
going on with you-

103
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:29,908
- Hey it's Tristan,

104
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,610
dude, I just saw your story and

105
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,145
- and you made and extra tray
of "fuck it" nachos--

106
00:08:33,147 --> 00:08:35,280
- Dude pick up the
fucking phone for once-

107
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:36,782
- There's not enough time
to profess all my love -

108
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:38,951
- Hello?

109
00:08:38,953 --> 00:08:40,953
Are you coming over
for dinner or not?

110
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:53,832
Dylan? Seriously?

111
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,734
- If you don't call me back I'm
calling the cops -

112
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:57,669
- to do a wellness check on
your ass -

113
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:36,977
- Angel?

114
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:46,318
Angel?

115
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,321
Angel!

116
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,126
What the-

117
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:55,196
What the fuck?

118
00:09:57,898 --> 00:09:58,899
Angel?

119
00:10:43,612 --> 00:10:44,776
Hey, Hey!

120
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:47,012
Fucking' try me asshole!

121
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:49,181
Hey, the fucking cops
are on their way!

122
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:50,651
You piece of shit-

123
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:56,388
Angel, where'd you go?

124
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,489
Angel?

125
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:58,759
Where'd you go?

126
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,941
- What the fuck?

127
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:27,352
- Mm, that's fucking delicious

128
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,420
Ah.

129
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:30,557
Oh, that is good.

130
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:33,526
I know my way
around the kitchen.

131
00:11:33,528 --> 00:11:34,695
- Agh!

132
00:11:35,564 --> 00:11:37,496
- Ho Ho Ho!

133
00:11:37,498 --> 00:11:39,164
- Ho Ho Ho.

134
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,699
Merry Christmas.

135
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,201
- Marshall?

136
00:11:42,203 --> 00:11:43,268
- Weird, huh?

137
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,469
- What is this?

138
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:46,271
- I'm here to
celebrate with you.

139
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:49,174
You did it. You made
it a year, buddy.

140
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:52,110
If there was ever a time to
spike the eggnog, this is it.

141
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:53,845
- No it's- I am not
your buddy and I'm not-

142
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:55,080
- I'm here because I care!

143
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:57,049
I don't see anybody
else celebrating.

144
00:11:57,051 --> 00:11:58,450
You don't care
you're my dealer -

145
00:11:58,452 --> 00:11:59,818
- I'm your ex dealer.

146
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,221
And we were pretty good
friends for a while too.

147
00:12:02,223 --> 00:12:04,256
All that's in the past.

148
00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:06,858
I'm here today as like
your shamanic therapist

149
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,195
that wants to guide
you on a journey

150
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:13,566
of realization because you've
been going through a lot.

151
00:12:13,568 --> 00:12:15,434
- No, I'm, I'm getting
outta here, how.

152
00:12:15,436 --> 00:12:16,468
- Dylan, dylan!

153
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,803
- You're denying help right now.

154
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:19,639
And that's textbook
addict behavior.

155
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,609
Dylan, you're sick.

156
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:24,209
You're sad.

157
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:26,211
And you need help.

158
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:27,946
Let me help you.

159
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:29,649
Why don't we just
dip our toes in.

160
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:31,383
Fire up a backwoods.

161
00:12:31,385 --> 00:12:33,118
Middle school shit.

162
00:12:34,355 --> 00:12:35,320
I'm not-

163
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:36,390
I'm not touching anything
that you give me.

164
00:12:36,524 --> 00:12:37,956
- Well we're going to need
something to take the edge off

165
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,592
because we have a
Herculean amount

166
00:12:39,594 --> 00:12:41,895
of duct tape to peel
off therapy-wise.

167
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:43,563
One death

168
00:12:43,565 --> 00:12:45,297
is a lot

169
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:47,366
an entire family?

170
00:12:47,368 --> 00:12:49,034
That's some Holocaust shit.

171
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:50,402
And I don't say that lightly,

172
00:12:50,404 --> 00:12:52,505
I know you're not supposed
to joke about the Holocaust

173
00:12:52,507 --> 00:12:55,510
because it didn't happen.
But I stand by my metaphor.

174
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:57,909
Because what you've
been going through

175
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:00,613
has to be unfathomable,

176
00:13:00,615 --> 00:13:02,182
recovering pill-head or not.

177
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,954
Good news is you got the same
backstory as the Punisher

178
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,856
and he's my all time favorite
comic book character.

179
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:12,759
I mean there is
nothing more badass

180
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:14,059
than losing your entire family

181
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:16,461
and continuing to
fight the good fight.

182
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:17,829
Okay, I'm picking up vibes

183
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,865
like you don't want
to be here right now.

184
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:21,035
I get it.

185
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:23,368
There's a key.

186
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,906
Anytime you want, you
just let yourself back in.

187
00:13:29,577 --> 00:13:32,277
I'm always
here for buddy.

188
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,280
You know that.

189
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:36,481
But but but-

190
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,784
Wait wait wait-

191
00:13:37,786 --> 00:13:41,255
before I forget...
your Christmas present!

192
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:43,855
we got two goodie bags
for you to choose from.

193
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:44,956
In this hand, we got

194
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,694
The Great Green
Glorious Goodie Bag of Glee.

195
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:51,396
It's full of herbal tea and
mint flavored dental floss.

196
00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:54,066
You choose this bag, you can
wake up Christmas morning

197
00:13:54,068 --> 00:13:55,434
like none of this ever happened

198
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:58,270
and you can continue
being a Sober Sally.

199
00:13:58,272 --> 00:14:00,472
You know what we
have in this hand?

200
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:01,607
In this hand,

201
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:04,343
we have the Rip Roaring' Red Bag

202
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:07,079
of Rooby Dooby-Doo
Snackie Poos and-

203
00:14:07,081 --> 00:14:10,117
wait, wait, what, what
did I put in here again?

204
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,552
some Oxy Cottontail,

205
00:14:12,554 --> 00:14:15,788
icy shards of crystal meth
in case you want to stay up

206
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,023
way up past your bedtime.

207
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:20,125
Some Xanax
in case you need

208
00:14:20,127 --> 00:14:22,127
to hop a flight to Zanzibar,

209
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:24,129
smooth things out
for a little while.

210
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:27,132
And I got some super
special mushroom chocolate

211
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:30,770
the psilocybin is
powderized, extracted,

212
00:14:30,772 --> 00:14:33,606
blended with reishi
and cordyceps,

213
00:14:33,608 --> 00:14:34,774
this is special designer shit-

214
00:14:34,776 --> 00:14:37,876
This is the Tesla
of psychedelics.

215
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,144
You choose this bag,

216
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:42,414
You'll be riding the short
bus to hallucination station!

217
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,783
Woo-woo!

218
00:14:43,785 --> 00:14:44,817
- This is not cool.

219
00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:45,917
- Yeah, no, I know.

220
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,587
Just pick a color

221
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:48,887
red, or green-

222
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,389
All right let's cut
the bullshit here,

223
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:52,157
I've been talking a
lot. I tend to do that.

224
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,228
What do you want?
What do you want?

225
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:59,431
- I wanna stay clean, but
it is a fucking struggle.

226
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:00,533
And you show up here-

227
00:15:00,535 --> 00:15:01,468
- All right, well

228
00:15:01,603 --> 00:15:04,035
maybe move outta' your
dead family's vacation house

229
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:06,171
ya weirdo, you already
trashed one house.

230
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:08,608
- You know what give
me this fucking bag.

231
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,275
Oh man.

232
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:13,245
I didn't think you'd
actually fall for that.

233
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:16,649
They're both drug. It's always
the same result with you,

234
00:15:16,651 --> 00:15:17,884
no matter your intentions.

235
00:15:17,886 --> 00:15:19,117
You know that.

236
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:21,788
You have a disease.

237
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,523
You're like a kid
with bone cancer,

238
00:15:23,525 --> 00:15:25,758
except nobody wants
to make your wish.

239
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,992
Was that mean of me?

240
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:29,363
Making you think
you had a choice?

241
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:31,229
- People think freedom

242
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:33,699
is like freedom to
do whatever you want.

243
00:15:33,701 --> 00:15:35,333
When in fact freedom
is, you know,

244
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:38,003
choosing not to harm
yourself or others.

245
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:39,938
- Did you learn that when
you became my sponsor

246
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,939
or are you just listening

247
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,974
to Russell Brand's
Instagram too much?

248
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:44,644
- It's a little bit of both.

249
00:15:44,646 --> 00:15:45,678
Fuck.

250
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:48,313
Can you re-spawn me?

251
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:51,151
- Can I re-spawn you? No,
you have re-spawn yourself

252
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:52,951
and I...

253
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:54,252
- Oh!

254
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:55,255
- Hi.

255
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:58,390
Is that for me?

256
00:15:58,392 --> 00:15:59,527
- Oh yeah, sure.

257
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:02,396
- I love these things.

258
00:16:04,766 --> 00:16:05,798
- Well this is new.

259
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,633
- Yeah, it's an RPG.

260
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:08,400
- Is it any good?

261
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:09,100
- No.

262
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:09,936
Same old shit.

263
00:16:09,938 --> 00:16:10,738
Predictable.

264
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:13,541
- Hey, have you seen Angel?

265
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,578
- Dude, don't do that.

266
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:19,077
You've already been
through enough, okay?

267
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,312
You don't deserve that.

268
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:21,315
Fuck!

269
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:23,484
I had to tell you somethi-

270
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:26,752
- Ah!

271
00:16:26,754 --> 00:16:28,320
The door wants to talk to you.

272
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:28,957
- Huh?

273
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:30,222
- The weird-ass door that
popped outta' nowhere?

274
00:16:30,224 --> 00:16:31,557
it fuckin' wants to talk to you.

275
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:32,592
- Wait what?

276
00:16:32,594 --> 00:16:33,526
THE DOOR!

277
00:16:33,528 --> 00:16:35,661
The door, the weird-ass
door that popped-

278
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:40,766
- It's I, THE GOLDEN DOOR!

279
00:16:40,768 --> 00:16:42,135
- Oh, dang.

280
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,436
- Wait, wait, hey.

281
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:45,405
Am I in trouble?

282
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:47,540
- Fuck

283
00:16:47,542 --> 00:16:48,406
Fuck

284
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:49,609
Fuuuck.

285
00:16:49,611 --> 00:16:50,643
- What do you mean fuck?

286
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:52,879
- I dunno. I, I don't know.

287
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:54,348
- You don't know?

288
00:16:57,886 --> 00:16:59,484
- You've been good, right?

289
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:00,385
Yeah I've been good

290
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:01,854
I haven't done anything
for a year so like-

291
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:02,955
- I'm so
glad I'm not you.

292
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:04,089
No, you should be fine.

293
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:06,426
You should be fine,
you should be fine.

294
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:08,360
Motherfucker!

295
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:09,194
Ah!

296
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,395
I hate this shit,
I hate this shit.

297
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:11,898
Motherfucker.
It's not fair!

298
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,769
Every time I try to do this
shit it does the same old thing.

299
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,238
I have to shit.

300
00:17:43,932 --> 00:17:45,297
Hey... HEY!

301
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:46,799
Don't do it champ.
Is that smart?

302
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:47,800
Have you thought this through?

303
00:17:47,802 --> 00:17:50,068
Should I not, open... you?

304
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,837
- No, you definitely should.

305
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,171
Not open me.

306
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:55,007
I just need to, before
you reach the handle.

307
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:56,074
Okay. Yes.

308
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,543
Open me. I will walk...

309
00:17:57,545 --> 00:17:59,110
I will walk you
through what to do

310
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:00,613
so that you can walk through

311
00:18:00,615 --> 00:18:02,715
you with it, through
me, you and me

312
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:04,984
we will walk through this
together. I'll walk you through-

313
00:18:04,986 --> 00:18:06,052
- Mmm, mmm!

314
00:18:06,054 --> 00:18:07,820
- Sorry, do I, do
I not open you?

315
00:18:07,822 --> 00:18:08,721
Do I open you?
What do I do?

316
00:18:08,723 --> 00:18:10,355
- Okey dokey champ, let's
try this one more time.

317
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:11,489
This is gonna be simple.

318
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:13,025
You just gotta listen
to instructions

319
00:18:13,027 --> 00:18:14,627
and just stand there

320
00:18:14,629 --> 00:18:15,797
and sit down.

321
00:18:15,897 --> 00:18:16,696
- What?

322
00:18:16,698 --> 00:18:17,763
- SIT DOWN!!!!

323
00:18:20,568 --> 00:18:22,200
Ho ho ho!

324
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:24,804
Merry Christmas, Dylan.

325
00:18:24,806 --> 00:18:27,105
I am Santa Door!

326
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,575
I love Christmas.

327
00:18:29,577 --> 00:18:30,578
Don't you?

328
00:18:59,974 --> 00:19:01,439
- What do I press?

329
00:19:02,577 --> 00:19:05,011
- like the dumb leading
the blind here...

330
00:19:05,013 --> 00:19:06,681
- Dylan, get in here!

331
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:09,180
- Dylan!

332
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:11,017
- What?

333
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:11,917
- What do mean, what?

334
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:12,620
Come here!

335
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,855
- I'm
playing my game.

336
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:15,554
- You know today is?

337
00:19:15,556 --> 00:19:16,488
- Mm, no.

338
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,457
Should I?

339
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:20,158
- Today is your day.

340
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,663
- Oh-kay...

341
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:26,264
- Come on, open it.

342
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:27,434
- All right.

343
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:38,311
- You gonna say anything?

344
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,715
- I, I've done this.

345
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:42,583
I've heard this before.

346
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:46,353
- Not from us.

347
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,219
- I'm gonna be adopted?!

348
00:19:49,757 --> 00:19:53,793
- Okay, this is our first
official family video.

349
00:19:53,795 --> 00:19:55,861
- Yeah!

350
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:57,029
- So don't blow it.

351
00:19:57,031 --> 00:19:59,464
Okay, here we go.

352
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:02,134
- Let's hope he doesn't
regret this, okay?

353
00:20:02,136 --> 00:20:03,201
- You probably will.

354
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,403
- All right everybody-

355
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,139
- Briana, let go of
one of those amazing farts

356
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:08,140
that you know, you're known for.

357
00:20:08,142 --> 00:20:09,309
Come on now!

358
00:20:10,178 --> 00:20:11,409
- Dad, nice hat!

359
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:14,882
- This is an untraditional
Christmas family, so-

360
00:20:15,783 --> 00:20:16,782
- Hey dad?

361
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:17,817
Dad.

362
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:18,953
- Yeah?

363
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:21,587
- Do we keep lighting
this candle thing
or is that done now?

364
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:23,421
- That's a
menorah and that one,

365
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,157
we actually don't light.

366
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:28,861
We pour oil into the middle
one, but we're past that now.

367
00:20:28,863 --> 00:20:29,795
- Oh, okay.

368
00:20:29,797 --> 00:20:30,963
- Yeah. Good
job though, good job.

369
00:20:30,965 --> 00:20:32,031
- Thanks.

370
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:33,099
- How's it going?

371
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:34,399
I keep meaning to ask like,

372
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:36,602
why do you guys celebrate
every holiday, but aren't-

373
00:20:36,604 --> 00:20:38,137
- Shh, Shh!

374
00:20:38,139 --> 00:20:39,171
If you shut up.

375
00:20:39,173 --> 00:20:40,940
You get more presents.

376
00:20:40,942 --> 00:20:41,774
- You know what you're-

377
00:20:41,776 --> 00:20:43,310
- Yeah, you'll
figure it out.

378
00:20:43,811 --> 00:20:45,477
- Mom's been
sipping the egg nog.

379
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:47,312
- Don't tell them that!

380
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:49,483
Can I have a sip?

381
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,334
- What you watching?

382
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:10,104
- I was watching
my adoption tape,

383
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:14,206
but now I've just been watching
like 10 minutes of us asleep

384
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,709
on Christmas as
kids. You wanna see?

385
00:21:16,711 --> 00:21:18,110
- Yeah.

386
00:21:18,112 --> 00:21:19,046
Little nuggets.

387
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,286
You know, back before
everybody had a camera

388
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:29,456
in their pocket,

389
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:33,424
Dad was the one
documenting everything.

390
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:36,494
He would've loved today's
social media shit show.

391
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:38,164
- Isn't it so funny how like,

392
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,832
this has huge sentimental value.

393
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:41,332
But now that we take
photos and videos

394
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:44,402
like 20, 30 times a day,
it's like, who cares?

395
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:46,437
- You know, that was your
dad's favorite video.

396
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:48,339
- Wait, this one us sleeping?

397
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:51,610
- Mhmm, he used to say
there was nothing better

398
00:21:51,612 --> 00:21:53,948
than seeing you all to sleep

399
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,884
warm blankets, full belly.

400
00:21:58,886 --> 00:21:59,885
Safe.

401
00:21:59,887 --> 00:22:01,823
He would say that that's
some Mr. Rogers shit.

402
00:22:03,257 --> 00:22:05,925
Oh, you know, you know that
I'm faking being asleep here?

403
00:22:05,927 --> 00:22:07,092
- Mm, you faking it?

404
00:22:07,094 --> 00:22:08,160
- Yeah. I'm faking it.

405
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:10,196
Okay, so like I'm laying there,

406
00:22:10,198 --> 00:22:11,297
my mind's going berserk

407
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:13,532
because my mind's
always going berserk.

408
00:22:13,534 --> 00:22:15,466
And you know, every Christmas
before this was awful.

409
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:18,270
I mean, you know, but
this one was peaceful.

410
00:22:18,272 --> 00:22:20,239
This was my first
peaceful Christmas ever.

411
00:22:20,241 --> 00:22:21,472
Thank you for that by the way.

412
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:22,842
And I, you know, out
the corner of my eye

413
00:22:22,844 --> 00:22:24,710
I see dad's cleaning, he's
cleaning everything. Right?

414
00:22:24,712 --> 00:22:26,312
Like the food, the
wrapping paper, the dishes,

415
00:22:26,314 --> 00:22:28,581
the whole mountain of
dishes. And he's happy.

416
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:30,216
Like he's humming, right?

417
00:22:30,218 --> 00:22:31,750
Like he's singing
while cleaning.

418
00:22:31,752 --> 00:22:34,820
And I had this impulse to
help him, and I don't know,

419
00:22:34,822 --> 00:22:35,756
I just didn't.

420
00:22:36,557 --> 00:22:37,725
I don't know why.

421
00:22:38,526 --> 00:22:39,725
I regret it, actually.

422
00:22:39,727 --> 00:22:40,893
It makes me sad.

423
00:22:40,895 --> 00:22:43,361
- That's a silly thing
to feel sad about.

424
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:44,495
Your dad loves
cleaning, you know that.

425
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:46,065
I know he loved
cleaning, but like,

426
00:22:46,067 --> 00:22:48,603
I could've helped the
guy, you know what I mean?

427
00:22:50,238 --> 00:22:51,402
- Aw.

428
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:53,074
- You will always be
that little kid to me.

429
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:57,375
No matter how big you get,
you will always be this big.

430
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:59,678
- The beard isn't
throwing you off at all?

431
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,047
- Nope, you were a cute kid.

432
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:03,849
- You know what sucks right now?

433
00:23:03,851 --> 00:23:07,822
I'm realizing that I, I
don't know grandma's name.

434
00:23:09,257 --> 00:23:10,388
- You know your
grandmother's name.

435
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,525
- I know, I know it.

436
00:23:11,626 --> 00:23:13,525
Like I know it's in my brain
somewhere, but I don't,

437
00:23:13,527 --> 00:23:15,194
I mean, like tell me
a story about her.

438
00:23:15,196 --> 00:23:16,195
I want to know.

439
00:23:16,197 --> 00:23:17,162
- Ah it's...

440
00:23:17,164 --> 00:23:18,099
It's impossible.

441
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:22,635
It's like, the of smell popcorn.

442
00:23:22,637 --> 00:23:25,304
How do you describe that to
somebody who's never had it?

443
00:23:25,306 --> 00:23:27,506
- Okay, well that's
a great example

444
00:23:27,508 --> 00:23:28,741
because if grandma was anything

445
00:23:28,743 --> 00:23:30,441
like popcorn, then she
must have been a badass.

446
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:31,844
- Oh popcorn is badass?

447
00:23:31,846 --> 00:23:34,649
Yeah, of course
popcorn's badass.

448
00:23:35,816 --> 00:23:36,817
- Okay.

449
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:41,856
She was my best friend.

450
00:23:43,324 --> 00:23:45,257
My very best friend.

451
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:47,895
When she died, my life ended.

452
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,396
Felt like it anyway.

453
00:23:50,398 --> 00:23:52,033
- Oh wait, was her name Beady?

454
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:55,200
- Her name was Dolores.

455
00:23:55,202 --> 00:23:56,769
- Ah, yes.

456
00:23:56,771 --> 00:23:59,472
We called her Beady because
she had beady little eyes.

457
00:24:00,274 --> 00:24:01,776
Grandpa's nickname for her.

458
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:06,547
Ah, Nope.

459
00:24:07,915 --> 00:24:09,281
Too painful.

460
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:11,016
Just like how you can't...

461
00:24:11,018 --> 00:24:13,652
NONE of us can talk about
your father without crumbling.

462
00:24:13,654 --> 00:24:16,021
- Oh that is fair as shit.

463
00:24:16,023 --> 00:24:17,022
- Ugh.

464
00:24:17,024 --> 00:24:17,758
- Yuh.

465
00:24:17,925 --> 00:24:19,858
Why does dying have to
be such a sad thing?

466
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,060
Like why can't it
be a happy thing?

467
00:24:21,062 --> 00:24:23,762
Like when I die, I
hope people party, man.

468
00:24:23,764 --> 00:24:25,397
I want people to tell
stories about me,

469
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:27,132
like how cool I was and...

470
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:28,500
Come on, just tell me one thing,

471
00:24:28,502 --> 00:24:30,035
like one unique
thing about grandma.

472
00:24:30,037 --> 00:24:31,303
I don't know anything
about grandma.

473
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:33,739
Like did she smoke?

474
00:24:33,741 --> 00:24:35,007
Did she have her ears pierced?

475
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:35,874
Okay Okay Okay.

476
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:36,942
<i>- Oh, look what I find?</i>

477
00:24:36,944 --> 00:24:40,815
- Drunk and drugged
out of his mind per usual.

478
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:42,748
Hey big bro.

479
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,650
This is going straight to
your probation officer.

480
00:24:44,652 --> 00:24:46,018
Look at your fucking eyes.

481
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,753
- Hey, good, you're
all dead to me anyways.

482
00:24:47,755 --> 00:24:49,123
- Oh, we're dead to you?

483
00:24:50,758 --> 00:24:52,891
- I sat him outside, do you
want me to go talk to him,

484
00:24:52,893 --> 00:24:54,159
do you want both of
us to go talk to him?

485
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:55,327
What do you wanna do?

486
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:57,162
- Can you just, you
handle him first.

487
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:59,166
- Let me make some tea
to calm the fuck down.

488
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:01,300
- I'm going to kill him.

489
00:25:01,302 --> 00:25:04,036
- Are we gonna have another
Christmas with the cops or-

490
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:05,104
- Shut up Lilly.

491
00:25:05,106 --> 00:25:06,505
- I don't think that
is helpful right now-

492
00:25:06,507 --> 00:25:07,639
- Your brother is
killing himself.

493
00:25:07,641 --> 00:25:09,942
- I'm gonna go outside now.

494
00:25:09,944 --> 00:25:11,844
- Okay but I was
seriously joking.

495
00:25:11,846 --> 00:25:13,178
Oh my God, you need to relax

496
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,715
You do this every fucking time.

497
00:25:23,224 --> 00:25:24,191
- Thanks.

498
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:28,093
- I'm gonna be very calm.

499
00:25:28,095 --> 00:25:29,928
I'm CHOOSING to be calm.

500
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,030
The first words
out of your mouth

501
00:25:31,032 --> 00:25:32,933
are gonna be what
drugs you took today.

502
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:36,503
- What?

503
00:25:36,505 --> 00:25:37,636
I didn't fucking take anything,

504
00:25:37,638 --> 00:25:38,604
so I don't know what you want.

505
00:25:38,606 --> 00:25:39,774
- Try again.

506
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:43,144
- I smoked some spice
a couple hours ago.

507
00:25:44,445 --> 00:25:45,646
- Try again.

508
00:25:47,048 --> 00:25:49,715
- I smoked some spice,
like two hours ago.

509
00:25:49,717 --> 00:25:51,083
It's legal for Christ's sake.

510
00:25:51,085 --> 00:25:52,987
- Spice wears off
in like 20 minutes.

511
00:25:55,823 --> 00:25:58,023
- I took an Advil PM.

512
00:25:58,025 --> 00:26:00,059
I, I was gonna
take a nap earlier.

513
00:26:00,061 --> 00:26:02,163
So I took like one
or two Advil PMs.

514
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,830
- Cool, so you're
only two lies in.

515
00:26:04,832 --> 00:26:06,432
You haven't deflected
like crazy yet.

516
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:07,966
So whose fault is
it this time, Huh?

517
00:26:07,968 --> 00:26:09,401
Who are you gonna
blame this time, Huh?

518
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:10,604
- It's okay.

519
00:26:14,642 --> 00:26:16,610
What did we say about Christmas?

520
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:19,080
Hmm?

521
00:26:20,214 --> 00:26:22,781
We said that if you brought
drugs into this house

522
00:26:22,783 --> 00:26:24,683
or if you were high
around the kids,

523
00:26:24,685 --> 00:26:27,588
then no questions asked,
we were calling the police.

524
00:26:28,523 --> 00:26:31,792
Did we not have a huge
agreement on that?

525
00:26:37,832 --> 00:26:38,999
- I fucked up.

526
00:26:40,801 --> 00:26:42,036
I'm really sorry.

527
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:46,640
I broke off a baby
piece of Xanax.

528
00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:49,741
- Okay.

529
00:26:49,743 --> 00:26:51,078
Where did you get Xanax?

530
00:26:53,247 --> 00:26:54,348
- Lilly gave it to me.

531
00:26:55,382 --> 00:26:57,683
- Lilly, Lilly gave you Xanax.

532
00:26:57,685 --> 00:27:00,319
Why the fuck would
Lilly give you Xanax?

533
00:27:00,321 --> 00:27:01,386
Lilly loves Xanax.

534
00:27:01,388 --> 00:27:02,555
If she had Xanax,

535
00:27:02,557 --> 00:27:04,490
she'd be fucking high
on Xanax right now.

536
00:27:04,492 --> 00:27:05,824
- Whatever.

537
00:27:05,826 --> 00:27:07,962
I don't give a fuck
anymore, all right?

538
00:27:08,729 --> 00:27:10,929
Nobody gets it.

539
00:27:10,931 --> 00:27:14,099
- Especially you,
everyone just yells.

540
00:27:14,101 --> 00:27:15,134
- Stop. Okay.

541
00:27:15,136 --> 00:27:16,070
Fucking stop.

542
00:27:17,371 --> 00:27:19,037
I understand, okay?

543
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,340
You smell like shit,
you look like shit.

544
00:27:21,342 --> 00:27:22,374
Are you listening?

545
00:27:22,376 --> 00:27:23,344
Hey, listen to me.

546
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:25,811
We said no drugs.

547
00:27:25,813 --> 00:27:27,279
You said yes, drugs.

548
00:27:27,281 --> 00:27:28,415
So now you can't be here.

549
00:27:29,717 --> 00:27:31,216
God, you sometimes
I think you forget

550
00:27:31,218 --> 00:27:33,185
that I have been
exactly where you are.

551
00:27:33,187 --> 00:27:35,854
- Look, I'm not even invited
Christmas Eve for my family

552
00:27:35,856 --> 00:27:37,723
but it's okay because
once I'm gone-

553
00:27:37,725 --> 00:27:38,790
- You don't get it.

554
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:39,858
- Everyone can shut-

555
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,726
- You don't get it,
you don't get it!

556
00:27:40,728 --> 00:27:41,727
You're not invited-

557
00:27:41,729 --> 00:27:42,928
Shut the fuck up, okay?

558
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:44,665
You are not invited
where children are.

559
00:27:46,467 --> 00:27:47,701
Do you understand that?

560
00:27:48,802 --> 00:27:50,736
Because you've proven time and-

561
00:27:50,738 --> 00:27:52,738
- time and time again.

562
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,274
You're just gonna get fucked
up and ruin the holiday.

563
00:27:55,276 --> 00:27:57,176
Like right now you're
getting fucked up

564
00:27:57,178 --> 00:27:58,010
and ruining the holiday.

565
00:27:58,012 --> 00:27:59,947
- Oh like you're one to talk.

566
00:28:01,282 --> 00:28:03,583
It was a moment of weakness.

567
00:28:03,585 --> 00:28:06,586
But everybody just yells at me.

568
00:28:06,588 --> 00:28:07,753
I know what I need,

569
00:28:07,755 --> 00:28:11,023
I need a positive support system

570
00:28:11,025 --> 00:28:14,226
and your pigtails are bullshit.

571
00:28:14,228 --> 00:28:17,865
You don't even know
how to fucking tie
little loop-de-doops.

572
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:20,065
- I happen to think--

573
00:28:20,067 --> 00:28:21,035
- Knock, knock.

574
00:28:23,204 --> 00:28:24,102
- Who's there?

575
00:28:24,104 --> 00:28:25,272
- You laughed, I'm off the hook.

576
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,706
Fuck you.

577
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:29,107
- You fucking suck dude.

578
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:30,077
- Knock knock.

579
00:28:31,412 --> 00:28:33,180
- interrupting Turtle.

580
00:28:34,616 --> 00:28:35,582
- Why did the chicken cross the-

581
00:28:35,584 --> 00:28:36,850
- No, knock knock.

582
00:28:38,852 --> 00:28:39,918
- Who's there?

583
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,121
- Interrupting turtle.

584
00:28:43,224 --> 00:28:44,591
- I just wanna-

585
00:28:44,593 --> 00:28:45,692
- You have to say
interrupting turtle who.

586
00:28:45,694 --> 00:28:47,294
- Interrupting turtle who?

587
00:28:48,796 --> 00:28:50,530
Oh my God, what are you doing?

588
00:28:50,532 --> 00:28:51,463
Nope.

589
00:28:51,465 --> 00:28:52,397
- Gotcha.

590
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,498
- Okay, cool.

591
00:28:59,807 --> 00:29:01,108
It's officially midnight.

592
00:29:02,243 --> 00:29:04,142
Merry Christmas.

593
00:29:04,144 --> 00:29:05,177
- Yeah, let me,

594
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:08,648
let me put 500
pounds on your chest

595
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:11,483
and push it on you
and yell at you

596
00:29:11,485 --> 00:29:12,884
instead of giving you a spot

597
00:29:12,886 --> 00:29:14,687
and you'll know has
this fucking feels.

598
00:29:14,689 --> 00:29:16,121
- No, Dylan,

599
00:29:16,123 --> 00:29:17,724
Dylan you've had
nothing but help.

600
00:29:17,726 --> 00:29:19,193
- You've had nothing but help.

601
00:29:20,394 --> 00:29:22,828
The rehab people say that
if we keep babying you,

602
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,665
we bury you, right?

603
00:29:25,667 --> 00:29:27,399
Isn't that what they say?

604
00:29:27,401 --> 00:29:28,934
- Yeah.

605
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:32,371
- If I let you back into
that house, you don't learn.

606
00:29:32,373 --> 00:29:35,874
This may very well have been
your fix it or fuck it moment.

607
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:37,876
This was your chance to prove
that you could be a part

608
00:29:37,878 --> 00:29:38,944
of this family again.

609
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:40,979
And YOU decided to say fuck it.

610
00:29:40,981 --> 00:29:43,282
Not me, YOU chose this shit.

611
00:29:43,284 --> 00:29:46,451
And now I have to sound like
a fucking broken record player

612
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:48,987
because we keep having
the same conversation

613
00:29:48,989 --> 00:29:52,024
over and over again, and...

614
00:29:52,026 --> 00:29:54,293
Is he asleep right now?

615
00:29:54,295 --> 00:29:56,428
Are you fucking
sleeping right now?

616
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,196
- There's no point in us
doing this right now, okay?

617
00:29:58,198 --> 00:30:01,068
- I hope you're ODing right now.

618
00:30:02,236 --> 00:30:04,102
Do us all a favor, you
fucking embarrassment.

619
00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:05,738
- Hey! That's not gonna happen.

620
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,706
- Wake up!

621
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:07,607
Wake up!

622
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:08,574
- Briana!

623
00:30:08,576 --> 00:30:09,841
- Wake up, wake up, wake up!

624
00:30:12,413 --> 00:30:13,414
- Well.

625
00:30:15,049 --> 00:30:16,050
Crap.

626
00:30:18,586 --> 00:30:19,951
- I know you're high right now.

627
00:30:19,953 --> 00:30:21,754
- Oh Christ mom, come on-

628
00:30:21,756 --> 00:30:23,324
- Don't.

629
00:30:40,775 --> 00:30:42,577
Why can't you stop?

630
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:05,432
Okay.

631
00:31:10,805 --> 00:31:12,139
Okay.

632
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:24,084
- Mom?

633
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:35,896
Am I in trouble, or...?

634
00:31:45,305 --> 00:31:46,373
- Give.

635
00:31:48,643 --> 00:31:49,644
Unplug it.

636
00:32:02,557 --> 00:32:05,323
When you are one year sober.

637
00:32:05,325 --> 00:32:08,360
When you are present,
pun intended,

638
00:32:08,362 --> 00:32:11,498
you're gonna open this and
we will watch it together.

639
00:32:12,534 --> 00:32:15,269
And I will tell you stories
about my mom and dad.

640
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,171
And not make it a sad thing.

641
00:32:19,173 --> 00:32:20,038
Deal?

642
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,546
Try again.

643
00:34:22,697 --> 00:34:24,530
- Try again.

644
00:34:24,532 --> 00:34:25,430
Try again.

645
00:34:25,432 --> 00:34:26,464
- Let's try this one more time.

646
00:34:26,466 --> 00:34:27,501
I'm a talking door, all right?

647
00:34:27,835 --> 00:34:29,835
Alright? I'm a flipping' talking
door and I just materialized

648
00:34:29,837 --> 00:34:30,705
in the middle of
your living room.

649
00:34:30,939 --> 00:34:34,105
So you tell me... Does that
sound like safety or danger?

650
00:34:34,107 --> 00:34:35,240
Are you in safety
or danger Dylan?

651
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:36,376
- I've got a knife.

652
00:34:36,443 --> 00:34:38,410
- Oh yeah, it's gonna
be a lot harder for me,

653
00:34:38,412 --> 00:34:40,646
a magic door, to bend
time and tie you up

654
00:34:40,648 --> 00:34:42,380
with Christmas lights now
that you have a knife.

655
00:34:42,382 --> 00:34:44,249
Look, I can't promise anything,

656
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:45,952
but I CAN promise you something

657
00:34:45,954 --> 00:34:47,653
I will never hurt you.

658
00:34:47,655 --> 00:34:48,656
Ugly Jesus.

659
00:34:49,423 --> 00:34:50,990
- All right, well
now I'm nervous

660
00:34:50,992 --> 00:34:52,060
so I'm bringing the knife.

661
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:53,993
Yeah kiddo you would be
stupid not to bring a knife.

662
00:34:53,995 --> 00:34:57,095
Come on bruiser, you got this
you big old burger, come on.

663
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:59,164
Agh! You dirty dog,
that's my PEE PEE!

664
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:00,365
- Open up. Come on.

665
00:35:00,367 --> 00:35:01,299
- No, you need the key code.

666
00:35:01,301 --> 00:35:02,334
- Open up, come on.

667
00:35:02,336 --> 00:35:03,502
- No, you need a key code.

668
00:35:03,504 --> 00:35:04,202
- Key, what?

669
00:35:04,204 --> 00:35:05,339
- A key code.

670
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,806
- The drug guy, he told you
about the key code, right?

671
00:35:06,808 --> 00:35:07,807
- There's a key.

672
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:09,008
- You know that. Cool.

673
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:12,310
- Honestly, I wish somebody was
helping me with all of this-

674
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,047
- It's kind difficult all alone

675
00:35:15,049 --> 00:35:16,181
getting the basics across...

676
00:35:16,183 --> 00:35:17,349
Agh my fucking alarm
didn't go off... Am I late?!

677
00:35:17,351 --> 00:35:18,483
Do you need me now?

678
00:35:18,485 --> 00:35:20,120
Cuz this is where I come in,
right? To help?

679
00:35:20,755 --> 00:35:21,954
The Mystery Door!

680
00:35:21,956 --> 00:35:23,022
- Hey.

681
00:35:23,024 --> 00:35:24,056
- I'm here! I got here!

682
00:35:24,058 --> 00:35:25,190
- Hey, good morning.

683
00:35:25,192 --> 00:35:26,193
- Oh okay now, am I needed now?

684
00:35:26,493 --> 00:35:28,894
- No, I'm good, I got it, I
got it over here, thank you.

685
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,929
- You need me say, you need me.

686
00:35:29,931 --> 00:35:31,631
I'm just telling this dude -

687
00:35:31,633 --> 00:35:32,533
- I'm here to help.

688
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:35,001
- Didn't your dude obviously
hold out a key for him to unlock

689
00:35:35,003 --> 00:35:36,002
- Oh look at me, I'm
ready, I'm ready!

690
00:35:36,004 --> 00:35:38,004
- No, that door
opened on its own.

691
00:35:38,006 --> 00:35:39,538
- Ah, come on, you narc.

692
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,107
- Oh yeah, dude, it was nuts.

693
00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:42,742
I woke up, the whole
house is shaking to shit.

694
00:35:42,744 --> 00:35:44,910
There's an earthquake, like
the lights are going crazy.

695
00:35:44,912 --> 00:35:46,912
All these fucking
doors were open.

696
00:35:46,914 --> 00:35:48,114
Okay dude, between you and me?

697
00:35:48,116 --> 00:35:49,481
I want one hundred
percent thought

698
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:51,984
I was getting
abducted by aliens.

699
00:35:51,986 --> 00:35:53,218
- There are no
earthquakes in Florida.

700
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,654
There are no fault
lines in Florida.

701
00:35:54,656 --> 00:35:55,821
I know that Florida
doesn't have earthquakes.

702
00:35:55,823 --> 00:35:57,523
I'm just saying that
like everything was-

703
00:35:57,525 --> 00:36:00,559
- There was an earthquake
in 1792 at 12:58 PM, so...

704
00:36:00,561 --> 00:36:02,628
- Hm, 1792. She's right, yeah.

705
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,296
- Yeah, yeah yeah!

706
00:36:03,497 --> 00:36:04,364
- Hey big guy, if
we're gonna do this,

707
00:36:04,431 --> 00:36:05,531
you just gotta be
straight with me.

708
00:36:05,533 --> 00:36:07,099
It makes you look
bad when you lie

709
00:36:07,101 --> 00:36:07,900
and when you look
bad I look bad.

710
00:36:07,902 --> 00:36:08,968
- This is what happened.

711
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,102
- Maybe we should just huddle up

712
00:36:10,104 --> 00:36:11,169
- I'm just saying.

713
00:36:11,171 --> 00:36:12,439
All right... I don't...

714
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,673
- Alright my boy, you used a key
code to get through her --

715
00:36:13,675 --> 00:36:14,774
- I backed into the door
and it opened on its own.

716
00:36:14,776 --> 00:36:17,208
I don't know what... do
you wanna chime in here?

717
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,309
- My bad?

718
00:36:18,311 --> 00:36:19,745
- See? See what
I'm dealing with.

719
00:36:19,747 --> 00:36:21,346
- Hey, Mystery Door.

720
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:22,782
You forget to lock yourself up?

721
00:36:22,784 --> 00:36:24,083
You did, didn't you?

722
00:36:24,085 --> 00:36:25,450
Yeah... My bad.

723
00:36:25,452 --> 00:36:27,485
- So where we're
at is that you let

724
00:36:27,487 --> 00:36:29,855
low budget Bradley Cooper open
a magic door without a key-

725
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:31,090
- Hey, are you talking shit
about me over there?

726
00:36:31,092 --> 00:36:32,390
- Which makes him now believe

727
00:36:32,392 --> 00:36:34,292
that he doesn't need a key code-

728
00:36:34,294 --> 00:36:35,393
- 'Feck off I did it half right.

729
00:36:35,395 --> 00:36:38,329
- And I want to express to you

730
00:36:38,331 --> 00:36:40,432
that that makes me feel upset.

731
00:36:40,434 --> 00:36:42,101
- I'm feeling upset because-

732
00:36:42,103 --> 00:36:43,301
- I said my bad.

733
00:36:43,303 --> 00:36:44,402
- I was spending a long time -

734
00:36:44,404 --> 00:36:45,971
- Look Goldie, I said my bad.

735
00:36:45,973 --> 00:36:47,372
- I'm kind of high,

736
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:50,511
so my order of operations is
all wonkly doodles, you know?

737
00:36:51,112 --> 00:36:52,144
- Kind of high?

738
00:36:52,146 --> 00:36:53,478
- Oh 'feck off, I
did a half right!

739
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,717
I thought the magic door
was gonna open like magic.

740
00:36:56,851 --> 00:36:58,718
You know like how magic works?

741
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,519
Or I don't know, do I
need to say Open Sesame?

742
00:37:00,521 --> 00:37:02,121
- Do I look like a lamp to
you? I'm a fecking door.

743
00:37:02,123 --> 00:37:05,423
Plus my guy got him to take a
baggie and made a huge point

744
00:37:05,425 --> 00:37:06,559
to like give him a key.

745
00:37:06,561 --> 00:37:07,662
<i>- If it helps, yeah,</i>

746
00:37:07,995 --> 00:37:10,129
<i>I gave him a key, but I didn't</i>
<i>make a huge thing about it.</i>

747
00:37:10,131 --> 00:37:11,264
- Wait hold on, you...

748
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,667
You gave me a key, but
you don't have a handle.

749
00:37:14,669 --> 00:37:15,868
What's the point
of giving me a key

750
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,103
if you don't have a handle?

751
00:37:17,105 --> 00:37:19,304
- Why am I not surprised, forgot
to give yourself a handle?

752
00:37:19,306 --> 00:37:20,440
- Feck off, ya know?!

753
00:37:20,742 --> 00:37:22,842
- And hey I did not
take anything all
right, I got tricked.

754
00:37:22,844 --> 00:37:24,242
- Officer, bro.

755
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:26,212
I swear I got tricked man.

756
00:37:26,214 --> 00:37:29,148
- Perhaps I can help.

757
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,916
Deflecting is not
the path Dylan.

758
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:31,984
Own up to this.

759
00:37:31,986 --> 00:37:33,384
There's a process to this.

760
00:37:33,386 --> 00:37:34,488
- There is a process.

761
00:37:34,555 --> 00:37:36,287
- I bet you think you
can please your old lady

762
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:37,690
without foreplay too?

763
00:37:37,692 --> 00:37:39,825
- That is a very good
point, Mystery door.

764
00:37:39,827 --> 00:37:41,560
Foreplay is important.

765
00:37:41,562 --> 00:37:42,695
- You're right,
foreplay is important.

766
00:37:42,697 --> 00:37:43,963
<i>- Foreplay</i>
<i>is important, bro.</i>

767
00:37:43,965 --> 00:37:46,098
- It's about the journey,
not the destination.

768
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,533
I'm sorry I was yelling earlier.

769
00:37:47,535 --> 00:37:50,002
- Making love is like
making a grilled cheese.

770
00:37:50,004 --> 00:37:52,204
Give it time to breathe.

771
00:37:52,206 --> 00:37:53,606
<i>- It's</i>
<i>salty, it's gooey.</i>

772
00:37:53,608 --> 00:37:56,041
<i>It's usually accomplished</i>
<i>in three to five minutes.</i>

773
00:37:56,043 --> 00:37:58,244
- Hey, Hey guys, let's
just get him back on track.

774
00:37:58,246 --> 00:37:59,678
Dylan. DYLAN...

775
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,848
Did you,
or did you not take...

776
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,152
... the druggies?

777
00:38:04,886 --> 00:38:07,520
- He presented me
with two bags, okay?

778
00:38:07,522 --> 00:38:08,954
- Did you or did you not
take a bag of something

779
00:38:08,956 --> 00:38:10,222
from a drug dealer yes or no?

780
00:38:10,224 --> 00:38:11,257
- Yes, but-.

781
00:38:11,259 --> 00:38:12,323
- See I told ya!

782
00:38:12,325 --> 00:38:13,358
- No... not my Dylan...

783
00:38:14,361 --> 00:38:15,393
- Look at that shite bucket!

784
00:38:15,395 --> 00:38:16,962
Hey! We got this guys

785
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:18,864
<i>He took the druggies!</i>

786
00:38:18,866 --> 00:38:19,698
- So you failed that test.

787
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,933
- Just gotta get that key code.

788
00:38:20,935 --> 00:38:22,101
- You CAN do this.

789
00:38:22,103 --> 00:38:23,235
Christmas CAN be saved.

790
00:38:23,237 --> 00:38:24,537
- We got this, right guys?

791
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:25,470
Woo!

792
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:27,940
- So what, now I gotta
go scour my whole house

793
00:38:27,942 --> 00:38:30,676
for a key code combo just to
open some bullshit door?

794
00:38:30,678 --> 00:38:32,443
- I'm a, I'm a bull crap door?

795
00:38:32,445 --> 00:38:34,445
I'm a bullshit door,
that's what you call me?

796
00:38:34,447 --> 00:38:36,215
- I think what the golden
door is trying to say-

797
00:38:36,217 --> 00:38:38,250
- No, I'm gonna curse now.

798
00:38:38,252 --> 00:38:39,450
If he's gonna curse at me,

799
00:38:39,452 --> 00:38:40,686
I'm just gonna
say it right back.

800
00:38:40,688 --> 00:38:43,155
- Hey, Hey, I'm
just as important-

801
00:38:43,157 --> 00:38:44,590
- Important, oh,
you're important?

802
00:38:44,592 --> 00:38:46,357
- I'm just as important as
this dude's quest for sobriety.

803
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:47,793
- You are in control...

804
00:38:47,795 --> 00:38:49,063
- Breathe.

805
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:53,500
Well done.

806
00:38:53,901 --> 00:38:55,000
- You suck!

807
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:56,001
You fucked this whole thing up!

808
00:38:56,003 --> 00:38:57,703
- You're the door that
led to drugs asshole.

809
00:38:57,705 --> 00:38:59,638
You started this wrong.
No handle.

810
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,440
- Breathe.

811
00:39:00,675 --> 00:39:01,841
- Don't need to spend
my whole fucking Christmas-

812
00:39:10,218 --> 00:39:13,319
- Okay let's all talk
at the same time.

813
00:39:13,321 --> 00:39:15,588
Who can be louder?
Who can be louder?

814
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,989
I'm loud. Look, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

815
00:39:16,991 --> 00:39:17,990
- Hey. Knock knock...

816
00:39:17,992 --> 00:39:18,924
- Fuck you.

817
00:39:18,926 --> 00:39:19,992
- No, fuck YOU!

818
00:39:19,994 --> 00:39:20,860
- Fuck you Golden Door!

819
00:39:20,862 --> 00:39:22,628
and fuck you Dylan!

820
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,863
You know I was gonna help
but you know what?

821
00:39:23,865 --> 00:39:25,698
I don't need to
hear another story

822
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,267
about a straight white dude
feeling bullshit remorse

823
00:39:28,269 --> 00:39:30,002
for his own
self-destructive ass!

824
00:39:30,004 --> 00:39:31,270
Boo, hoo!

825
00:39:31,272 --> 00:39:32,972
Just, watch all the
empathy I have for you.

826
00:39:32,974 --> 00:39:35,241
Look at my face, see
how empathetic I am?

827
00:39:35,243 --> 00:39:37,109
Now I'm gonna have
grilled cheese,

828
00:39:37,111 --> 00:39:40,279
dirty sex with your dead
fucking dad, you punk-ass bitch.

829
00:39:40,281 --> 00:39:41,446
- Hey!

830
00:39:41,448 --> 00:39:43,448
What the fuck did
you just say to me?

831
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:46,654
Hey, open up and say that
to my face motherfucker!

832
00:39:47,722 --> 00:39:48,856
Oh now you're gonna ignore me?

833
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,522
<i>- For the record,</i>
<i>I'm not ignoring you.</i>

834
00:39:50,524 --> 00:39:51,891
<i>I just don't want</i>
<i>to get involved.</i>

835
00:39:51,893 --> 00:39:53,893
<i>This is between</i>
<i>you and the door.</i>

836
00:39:53,895 --> 00:39:55,327
- Right, you know
what? That's not fair.

837
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:56,564
That's not fair!

838
00:39:57,632 --> 00:39:58,530
Oh!

839
00:39:58,532 --> 00:39:59,798
- Mother fuck!

840
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,699
<i>- Okay,</i>
<i>that wasn't me.</i>

841
00:40:00,701 --> 00:40:02,167
<i>That was the door, I swear.</i>

842
00:40:02,169 --> 00:40:03,434
<i>I'm a little scared of you.</i>

843
00:40:03,436 --> 00:40:05,638
- Hey!

844
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,876
Hey, your buddy just tried
to break fucking my nose.

845
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:13,648
Oh great, now you're
gonna ignore me too.

846
00:40:16,617 --> 00:40:18,984
<i>- You're doing drugs in</i>
<i>dad's house?!</i>

847
00:40:18,986 --> 00:40:20,286
<i>I hate you!</i>

848
00:40:20,288 --> 00:40:22,288
<i>We all hate you!</i>

849
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:23,555
- Another one.

850
00:40:23,557 --> 00:40:25,626
Got a bunch of
alive dudes today.

851
00:40:29,462 --> 00:40:30,596
- It's a bear!

852
00:40:30,598 --> 00:40:32,264
- Yogi! Yogi! Yogi!

853
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:33,498
- When the night-

854
00:40:38,539 --> 00:40:40,074
- These ones are pretty.

855
00:40:41,943 --> 00:40:44,243
I saved his life
once again.

856
00:40:44,245 --> 00:40:45,945
- Saved my life.

857
00:40:47,748 --> 00:40:49,348
- Had a whoopsy-doodles.

858
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:51,152
- A major whoopsy-doodles.

859
00:40:51,484 --> 00:40:53,385
- Today my
court-appointed therapist

860
00:40:53,387 --> 00:40:55,821
suggested that I talk
to an empty chair.

861
00:40:55,823 --> 00:40:57,256
That I could put my dead dad

862
00:40:57,258 --> 00:40:58,657
or anyone from my
past or present

863
00:40:58,659 --> 00:40:59,892
just write in an empty chair

864
00:40:59,894 --> 00:41:02,294
and I can hash
things out that way.

865
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:04,966
Look, the second that I start
talking to inanimate objects

866
00:41:05,666 --> 00:41:06,966
- Oh, that's blood.

867
00:41:06,968 --> 00:41:07,935
I'll take that please.

868
00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:30,089
- What the hell was that about?

869
00:41:30,091 --> 00:41:31,625
Huh?

870
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:41,734
- Doctor told me
I can't eat nuts anymore.

871
00:41:41,736 --> 00:41:44,336
Because I got
diverticulitis in my rectum.

872
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:45,971
- Yeah, nope you
gotta' stay away.

873
00:41:45,973 --> 00:41:48,476
- It's just smooth peanut
butter from here on out.

874
00:41:49,076 --> 00:41:50,976
- Yeah you gotta' stay
away from the bad stuff.

875
00:41:50,978 --> 00:41:53,647
- All right, I'm
going, I'm going.

876
00:41:54,915 --> 00:41:57,549
- If you don't stay
away from the bad stuff

877
00:41:57,551 --> 00:41:59,653
diverticulitis in the rectum...

878
00:42:02,723 --> 00:42:06,025
Angel!

879
00:42:06,027 --> 00:42:09,128
- Angel's had
a really long happy life.

880
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:11,063
Now, I know that because
doggies don't make it this long

881
00:42:11,065 --> 00:42:11,999
without a lot of love.

882
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:14,099
She's got a tumor and it's right
at the neck of her bladder.

883
00:42:14,101 --> 00:42:16,402
Here's the thing though,
I'm gonna level with you.

884
00:42:16,404 --> 00:42:17,504
- she does have cancer.

885
00:42:17,506 --> 00:42:18,572
Keep that in mind-

886
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:20,339
The only way that she's
gonna be able to urinate

887
00:42:20,341 --> 00:42:21,373
right now-

888
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:22,576
- Hold on.

889
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:25,411
So she has to have this plastic
thing hanging out of her?

890
00:42:25,413 --> 00:42:27,079
Like a cone for the
rest of her life?

891
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:28,147
- Effectively, Yes.

892
00:42:28,149 --> 00:42:30,549
So the game plan is that
we're gonna have to keep

893
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:32,017
that catheter in place,

894
00:42:32,019 --> 00:42:33,252
because it is the only way she's
gonna be able to

895
00:42:33,254 --> 00:42:34,119
pass urine right now.

896
00:42:34,121 --> 00:42:36,455
And it's being kept in
place by this balloon

897
00:42:36,457 --> 00:42:37,823
that resides in her bladder.

898
00:42:37,825 --> 00:42:40,259
If she's able to chew
at that catheter,

899
00:42:40,261 --> 00:42:43,862
that catheter can go up into
her bladder, it can rupture,

900
00:42:43,864 --> 00:42:46,432
and in the end we're not
gonna be doing surgery

901
00:42:46,434 --> 00:42:47,633
in this kind of situation.

902
00:42:47,635 --> 00:42:48,801
That's instant
euthanasia, Dylan.

903
00:42:48,803 --> 00:42:50,602
- Listen to her,
she hates the cone.

904
00:42:50,604 --> 00:42:52,004
I'm not gonna torture my dog

905
00:42:52,006 --> 00:42:53,540
for the last two weeks
of her life, I'm sorry.

906
00:42:53,542 --> 00:42:54,873
I'm not gonna do it.

907
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:56,742
Is there anything
else I can do for her?

908
00:42:56,744 --> 00:42:58,177
I'll level with ya.
Here's what it is.

909
00:42:58,179 --> 00:43:00,879
If she's with you on the
couch, head in your lap,

910
00:43:00,881 --> 00:43:02,214
go ahead, pop the cone off.

911
00:43:02,216 --> 00:43:04,149
You know give her a good
scratch behind the ears.

912
00:43:04,151 --> 00:43:05,217
Things like that.

913
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:06,151
The same rule applies though.

914
00:43:06,153 --> 00:43:08,220
I mean you gotta be
watching her really tight.

915
00:43:08,222 --> 00:43:09,288
So that cone's the only thing

916
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:11,056
that's gonna be stopping
her from getting at it.

917
00:43:11,058 --> 00:43:12,424
Now it's tough
love, I know that.

918
00:43:12,426 --> 00:43:13,659
It's not the greatest-

919
00:43:13,661 --> 00:43:15,094
- it could end up
rupturing her bladder.

920
00:43:15,096 --> 00:43:16,897
We discussed this before, we're
not gonna be doing surgery.

921
00:43:17,665 --> 00:43:19,298
She's got a tumor.

922
00:43:20,334 --> 00:43:21,400
You stupid piece of shit.

923
00:43:21,402 --> 00:43:22,401
- You need to stop.

924
00:43:22,403 --> 00:43:23,769
- You need to be watching her!

925
00:43:23,771 --> 00:43:25,671
- She has CANCER!

926
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:29,509
- Angel...

927
00:43:32,146 --> 00:43:33,948
Just get your fucking
shit together!

928
00:43:37,618 --> 00:43:40,752
- Ah
gaw-ga-gaw-ga-goo!

929
00:43:40,754 --> 00:43:42,156
That's my babies.

930
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:44,992
Hi.

931
00:43:45,693 --> 00:43:47,895
Hi Angel...

932
00:43:50,865 --> 00:43:53,632
Oh, let's take this off of you.

933
00:43:53,634 --> 00:43:56,368
Oh, get this off of here.

934
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:58,203
You're having a good day?

935
00:43:58,205 --> 00:44:00,407
Oh, you're having a
good day baby girl?

936
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:02,743
Oh, how we doing here?

937
00:44:04,278 --> 00:44:05,644
Oh smiling.

938
00:44:05,646 --> 00:44:07,514
That was a good-

939
00:44:07,516 --> 00:44:09,381
Oh, you're doing okay.

940
00:44:09,383 --> 00:44:11,183
You're smiling.

941
00:44:11,185 --> 00:44:13,252
You're doing okay.

942
00:44:20,261 --> 00:44:21,428
- Fucking stop.

943
00:44:24,498 --> 00:44:26,267
- Why can't you stop?

944
00:44:29,837 --> 00:44:31,303
- Good, there you are.

945
00:44:31,305 --> 00:44:32,639
I forgot to tell you.

946
00:44:32,641 --> 00:44:35,407
Be sure to hide any
razor blades or guns

947
00:44:35,409 --> 00:44:36,408
you got in the house.

948
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:37,309
- You know I don't own a gun.

949
00:44:37,311 --> 00:44:38,511
- Oh!

950
00:44:38,513 --> 00:44:40,045
- Here, take mine.

951
00:44:40,047 --> 00:44:41,847
You gotta have a toaster
if you want to make toast.

952
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:43,217
- I am not suicidal.

953
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:46,952
Why would I kill myself?

954
00:44:46,954 --> 00:44:48,987
- Dylan, you've been slowly
killing yourself for years.

955
00:44:48,989 --> 00:44:51,089
Do you know what drugs do
to your body over time?

956
00:44:51,091 --> 00:44:52,291
- Yes asshole, that's
why I've been sober --

957
00:44:52,293 --> 00:44:53,258
- Choo choo!

958
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:55,794
Look I gottta go.
My sugar baby is lactating.

959
00:44:55,796 --> 00:44:57,930
- Get you fucking
hand out of my face!

960
00:44:57,932 --> 00:45:00,600
How do you open the
goddamn golden door?

961
00:45:00,602 --> 00:45:02,000
- Dylan.

962
00:45:02,002 --> 00:45:05,370
If you didn't select
the great green glorious

963
00:45:05,372 --> 00:45:07,172
goodie bag of glee,

964
00:45:07,174 --> 00:45:10,610
the golden door would've
opened up on its own.

965
00:45:10,612 --> 00:45:12,277
I guess you've got
to wait another year.

966
00:45:12,279 --> 00:45:13,278
- I'm calling the cops.

967
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,147
Ooh scary, you're
calling the cops.

968
00:45:15,149 --> 00:45:17,082
Call the cops.

969
00:45:17,084 --> 00:45:19,785
Be sure to tell them that a
golden door teleported here,

970
00:45:19,787 --> 00:45:21,688
Your ex-drug dealer
materialized.

971
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:24,289
He's felon and he's been
waving a gun around.

972
00:45:24,291 --> 00:45:27,027
Translation bro: The cops
can't do shit for you now.

973
00:45:30,632 --> 00:45:31,797
<i>Hahaha!!!</i>

974
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:15,376
- What?

975
00:47:15,737 --> 00:47:16,935
- All right, um...

976
00:47:16,937 --> 00:47:19,438
There's a drug dealer in
my house and he has a gun.

977
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,274
He's waving it around,
I'm fucking scared man.

978
00:47:22,276 --> 00:47:24,211
I need you to send
someone right away.

979
00:47:39,326 --> 00:47:41,395
What do you mean
you can't help me?

980
00:48:11,125 --> 00:48:13,060
<i>Ah shit! Shit! Shit!</i>

981
00:48:21,969 --> 00:48:23,135
- Hi,
you've reached Gloria.

982
00:48:23,137 --> 00:48:24,639
Sorry I'm not here now.

983
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,807
- I really am Dylan.

984
00:48:27,809 --> 00:48:29,609
I'm sorry I'm not
here now to help you.

985
00:48:29,611 --> 00:48:31,611
You can do this.

986
00:48:31,613 --> 00:48:33,313
You're so strong.

987
00:48:34,281 --> 00:48:38,218
My baby boy, I miss you so much.

988
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:41,021
- Stop fucking with me!

989
00:48:42,189 --> 00:48:43,922
- Stop!

990
00:48:43,924 --> 00:48:45,259
- Stop!

991
00:48:49,396 --> 00:48:50,998
Ah.

992
00:48:54,334 --> 00:49:00,007
Please, I am truly,
genuinely trying my best.

993
00:49:10,885 --> 00:49:12,486
Can't you like search my heart?

994
00:49:13,353 --> 00:49:14,654
Can't you like see that I'm not,

995
00:49:14,656 --> 00:49:16,188
I'm not lying to you.

996
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:20,093
Like I did not touch anything
for a literal calendar year.

997
00:49:20,695 --> 00:49:22,196
Talk to me.

998
00:49:22,831 --> 00:49:24,198
Please?

999
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,301
Please???

1000
00:49:40,615 --> 00:49:42,447
<i>I'm gonna be adopted?</i>

1001
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:44,249
<i>- Like this isn't-</i>

1002
00:49:52,493 --> 00:49:54,159
- Congratulations!

1003
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:55,761
- Oh, is this that uh...

1004
00:49:55,763 --> 00:49:56,995
The, the magic stick.

1005
00:49:56,997 --> 00:49:58,063
Can you do it?

1006
00:49:58,065 --> 00:49:59,097
The magic stick thing.

1007
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:00,533
I want to see if I can
figure it out sober.

1008
00:50:00,535 --> 00:50:01,466
- Okay, hold on.

1009
00:50:01,468 --> 00:50:03,235
Let me get the
dirt off my hands.

1010
00:50:03,237 --> 00:50:06,873
Okay, so you see how
this has six colors?

1011
00:50:06,875 --> 00:50:08,240
It's the same on both sides.

1012
00:50:08,242 --> 00:50:09,341
- Yeah.

1013
00:50:09,343 --> 00:50:11,276
- Go ahead and pick a
number one through six.

1014
00:50:11,278 --> 00:50:12,143
- Three.

1015
00:50:12,145 --> 00:50:13,946
- Okay. 1, 2, 3, land on orange.

1016
00:50:13,948 --> 00:50:15,882
Is that fair? You just
go phew, there you go.

1017
00:50:15,884 --> 00:50:16,983
Now it's orange.

1018
00:50:16,985 --> 00:50:18,016
- He's a genius!

1019
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:19,752
- How does he do it?

1020
00:50:19,754 --> 00:50:20,753
Do you know how he does it?

1021
00:50:20,755 --> 00:50:21,656
I don't get it.

1022
00:50:21,756 --> 00:50:23,623
- Dude, our dad taught that
to us when we were five.

1023
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:24,726
It's a trick for kids.

1024
00:50:29,631 --> 00:50:32,565
<i>Tenth fricking time I've</i>
<i>fixed the fridge in a month.</i>

1025
00:50:33,868 --> 00:50:35,333
- Stop flossing,
everywhere you go.

1026
00:50:35,335 --> 00:50:37,503
It's disgusting, you fling
food shit everywhere.

1027
00:50:37,505 --> 00:50:40,372
- I'm not gonna apologize
for having perfect teeth.

1028
00:50:40,374 --> 00:50:42,942
- You, you can have
amazing teeth later.

1029
00:50:42,944 --> 00:50:45,310
- Perfect teeth, you
annihilate your insides,

1030
00:50:45,312 --> 00:50:47,078
but then you worship your teeth.

1031
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,482
You make no sense to me.

1032
00:50:52,921 --> 00:50:55,657
- Congratulations!

1033
00:50:59,027 --> 00:51:01,094
<i>- Surprise,</i>
<i>surprise, surprise!</i>

1034
00:51:02,062 --> 00:51:03,230
- What!

1035
00:51:03,731 --> 00:51:04,864
Guys?

1036
00:51:04,866 --> 00:51:06,097
I haven't seen you in forever.

1037
00:51:06,099 --> 00:51:07,165
<i>- Tell us the story.</i>

1038
00:51:07,167 --> 00:51:08,166
<i>We want to hear the story.</i>

1039
00:51:08,168 --> 00:51:09,902
Oh come on, of course I'll do it

1040
00:51:09,904 --> 00:51:11,504
<i>Yeah! Woo! Go Dylan!</i>

1041
00:51:11,506 --> 00:51:15,173
Ladies and gentlemen, fifteen
seconds left of the game.

1042
00:51:15,175 --> 00:51:18,744
We are down by one. Goalie
pulled. Center ice face off.

1043
00:51:18,746 --> 00:51:19,812
Ref drops the puck.

1044
00:51:19,814 --> 00:51:21,814
Your's truly wins the face off.

1045
00:51:21,816 --> 00:51:22,915
<i>- Obviously.</i>

1046
00:51:22,917 --> 00:51:23,916
I find an open patch of ice.

1047
00:51:23,918 --> 00:51:24,951
- Yeah, of course.

1048
00:51:24,953 --> 00:51:26,084
- He gives me the puck,

1049
00:51:26,086 --> 00:51:27,653
I dipsy-doodle
around a defender.

1050
00:51:27,655 --> 00:51:28,621
<i>- Duh!</i>

1051
00:51:28,623 --> 00:51:31,023
Boom! Nothing between me
and the goalie baby.

1052
00:51:31,025 --> 00:51:32,190
I got a break away.

1053
00:51:32,192 --> 00:51:33,626
<i>Holy cow!</i>
<i>A breakaway?!</i>

1054
00:51:33,628 --> 00:51:35,293
<i>- There's only seconds</i>
<i>left in the game?</i>

1055
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,762
<i>- The winning goal on his stick?</i>

1056
00:51:36,764 --> 00:51:38,096
<i>- I don't understand sports.</i>

1057
00:51:38,098 --> 00:51:39,665
- So, this is kind of
one of those moments

1058
00:51:39,667 --> 00:51:40,766
- Where time freezes.

1059
00:51:40,768 --> 00:51:42,133
- I see my Mom in the stands.

1060
00:51:42,135 --> 00:51:43,101
- Woo-hoo!

1061
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:45,203
She's just so proud of me.

1062
00:51:45,205 --> 00:51:46,539
And you know, I'm a kid.

1063
00:51:46,541 --> 00:51:47,540
<i>- I'm a trophy!</i>

1064
00:51:47,542 --> 00:51:48,543
- I got dreams.

1065
00:51:48,743 --> 00:51:52,812
So I imagine what it's gonna
be like to win the Stanley cup.

1066
00:51:52,814 --> 00:51:54,346
Score that game-winning goal.

1067
00:51:54,348 --> 00:51:56,348
You know, the cameras
come rushing onto the ice

1068
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:57,550
families in your face.

1069
00:51:57,552 --> 00:52:00,151
We got a happy ending,
ladies and gentlemen.

1070
00:52:00,153 --> 00:52:01,252
<i>- Yes! I love happy endings!</i>

1071
00:52:01,254 --> 00:52:03,221
<i>- Happy endings are my favorite!</i>

1072
00:52:03,223 --> 00:52:04,456
<i>- What happens next?</i>

1073
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:06,293
- You guys know
what happens next.

1074
00:52:06,961 --> 00:52:09,695
My head hits the
plexiglass full blast.

1075
00:52:09,697 --> 00:52:11,532
I get knocked out cold
once I hit the damn thing,

1076
00:52:12,533 --> 00:52:14,533
my neck is the first
thing to hit the ice

1077
00:52:14,535 --> 00:52:17,970
and neck snaps in four places.

1078
00:52:17,972 --> 00:52:19,437
I mean, he's not getting up.

1079
00:52:19,439 --> 00:52:21,741
Things could not possibly
get worse for Dylan.

1080
00:52:21,743 --> 00:52:23,341
Things couldn't possibly
get worse for Dylan-

1081
00:52:23,343 --> 00:52:25,778
- couldn't possibly get
worse for Dylan could they?

1082
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:26,946
<i>- That's my boy, Dylan!</i>

1083
00:52:26,948 --> 00:52:29,115
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, shh.

1084
00:52:29,117 --> 00:52:30,384
- Do you guys hear that?

1085
00:52:30,985 --> 00:52:32,051
- Oh, oh, I'm sorry!

1086
00:52:32,053 --> 00:52:34,152
Is he about to bounce back?

1087
00:52:36,323 --> 00:52:37,757
Ladies and gentlemen!

1088
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:40,793
We have a Rocky Balboa
kick-ass montage

1089
00:52:40,795 --> 00:52:42,028
on our hands!

1090
00:52:43,531 --> 00:52:46,364
- He's gonna be bigger,
faster and stronger!

1091
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:54,439
<i>- Did you do it?</i>

1092
00:52:54,441 --> 00:52:56,611
<i>...Did you become a hero?</i>

1093
00:52:56,844 --> 00:52:58,278
- No.

1094
00:52:59,279 --> 00:53:00,915
I'm sorry everybody.

1095
00:53:02,482 --> 00:53:04,719
He missed an entire
year of school.

1096
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:07,021
Bedridden.

1097
00:53:07,855 --> 00:53:11,592
Puking from vertigo
through a neck brace.

1098
00:53:13,895 --> 00:53:17,029
Whatever friends that he still
had, they all abandoned him

1099
00:53:17,031 --> 00:53:19,100
because over the
years he just steals.

1100
00:53:19,967 --> 00:53:23,671
He just steals pain pills
from all of their houses.

1101
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,107
I mean he didn't even
have the strength

1102
00:53:28,109 --> 00:53:29,977
to speak at his
father's funeral.

1103
00:54:11,018 --> 00:54:12,985
- Hello, everyone.

1104
00:54:12,987 --> 00:54:14,454
Thanks for coming.

1105
00:54:15,489 --> 00:54:19,091
I never really met
my biological dad.

1106
00:54:19,093 --> 00:54:22,228
I called my adopted dad, "dad".

1107
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:24,832
Since the first day that
they adopted me, and...

1108
00:54:28,803 --> 00:54:29,871
I can't do it.

1109
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,272
- If you knew my dad,

1110
00:54:34,274 --> 00:54:37,612
you knew that he was
a giant kid at heart.

1111
00:54:38,713 --> 00:54:41,647
He was a prankster
and to be honest,

1112
00:54:41,649 --> 00:54:44,183
I'm kind of half expecting him
to like pop out of his coffin

1113
00:54:44,185 --> 00:54:45,418
and go, "gotcha".

1114
00:54:48,256 --> 00:54:49,791
He loved Disney movies.

1115
00:54:51,225 --> 00:54:54,359
- Hercules was his favorite
because it's a story of a God

1116
00:54:54,361 --> 00:54:58,664
forced down from Mount
Olympus to birth as a baby

1117
00:54:58,666 --> 00:55:03,370
only to be adopted by humans
and raised as one of their own.

1118
00:55:04,806 --> 00:55:07,809
Eventually he
learns of his powers

1119
00:55:09,076 --> 00:55:12,978
and the adopted
kid saves the day.

1120
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,815
When he got sick,

1121
00:55:15,817 --> 00:55:18,316
he would hide these little
notes for us to find.

1122
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:21,620
So when he passed,

1123
00:55:21,622 --> 00:55:26,027
we would look at them and
look back and not be sad.

1124
00:55:27,628 --> 00:55:31,364
He didn't want remembering to
be always such a sad thing.

1125
00:55:33,366 --> 00:55:37,038
He always said good morning
to me when I woke up.

1126
00:55:43,511 --> 00:55:46,011
He always said "Choose good."

1127
00:55:46,013 --> 00:55:50,084
- It's so easy to be selfish
and lie, and blah blah blah.

1128
00:55:51,552 --> 00:55:54,352
Hercules not only
has killer abs,

1129
00:55:54,354 --> 00:55:55,656
but he has a killer heart.

1130
00:55:56,991 --> 00:55:59,859
No scratch that he doesn't
have a killer heart.

1131
00:55:59,861 --> 00:56:00,895
He has a kind heart.

1132
00:56:03,965 --> 00:56:05,496
The point is-

1133
00:56:05,498 --> 00:56:08,868
- he spent his whole life
helping us to be brave,

1134
00:56:11,138 --> 00:56:14,876
pushing us to choose good and
step out of our comfort zone.

1135
00:56:16,811 --> 00:56:20,045
- I'm not ready to say
goodbye to my dad, I'm not-

1136
00:56:20,047 --> 00:56:21,616
- He loved us all equally.

1137
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:25,284
There was no separation
between his biological

1138
00:56:25,286 --> 00:56:26,654
and adopted kids.

1139
00:56:28,556 --> 00:56:30,089
- I don't feel okay.

1140
00:56:30,091 --> 00:56:31,926
My head is-

1141
00:56:32,894 --> 00:56:34,427
- Whoa!

1142
00:56:35,162 --> 00:56:36,562
- Oh no! We've got him!

1143
00:56:36,564 --> 00:56:37,730
- We're not gonna lose you.

1144
00:56:37,732 --> 00:56:38,833
- Let's go!

1145
00:56:40,768 --> 00:56:43,068
- Dad, he has literal crap -

1146
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:44,236
- It's so bad, oh no.

1147
00:56:44,238 --> 00:56:45,706
- Tag!

1148
00:56:49,644 --> 00:56:50,475
- Oh no-

1149
00:56:50,477 --> 00:56:51,744
- My sister...

1150
00:56:51,746 --> 00:56:54,013
- Let go you're gonna break it!

1151
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:56,048
- You're gonna break
it, come on please stop.

1152
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:56,884
- Dylan!!!

1153
00:56:57,051 --> 00:56:58,449
- Why did you rip it off
we worked so hard on it.

1154
00:56:58,451 --> 00:56:59,718
- Hey what the hell?

1155
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,520
- He broke it,
you're an asshole!

1156
00:57:01,522 --> 00:57:03,488
- She needs to learn
that he's not coming back

1157
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:05,357
and not everything
is a sign from dad.

1158
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:06,558
- No grandpa told me

1159
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,360
that I could just have
five more minutes with dad.

1160
00:57:08,362 --> 00:57:09,897
- he said --

1161
00:57:10,798 --> 00:57:12,097
- Dylan!

1162
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:13,464
Ah!

1163
00:57:13,466 --> 00:57:15,236
- Hey, get off of him!

1164
00:57:15,569 --> 00:57:16,802
- Dylan if you
touch my stuff again

1165
00:57:16,804 --> 00:57:18,370
I swear I'll break your neck!

1166
00:57:18,372 --> 00:57:20,139
He's not even your real dad!

1167
00:57:20,141 --> 00:57:21,106
<i>He can't breathe!</i>

1168
00:57:21,108 --> 00:57:22,207
He's MINE!

1169
00:57:22,209 --> 00:57:23,275
<i>Briana, calm down!</i>

1170
00:57:23,277 --> 00:57:25,144
- You don't get to say anything!

1171
00:57:25,146 --> 00:57:26,514
<i>He can't breathe!</i>

1172
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:40,795
<i>He can't breathe!</i>

1173
00:57:42,563 --> 00:57:44,697
<i>- Is he</i>
<i>asleep right now?</i>

1174
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:46,801
<i>Are you fucking</i>
<i>sleeping right now?</i>

1175
00:57:48,402 --> 00:57:50,703
<i>I hope you're ODing.</i>

1176
00:57:50,705 --> 00:57:51,872
<i>He can't breathe!</i>

1177
00:57:51,973 --> 00:57:55,307
<i>- Do us all a favor</i>
<i>you fucking embarrassment.</i>

1178
00:57:55,309 --> 00:57:56,375
- Wake up!

1179
00:57:56,377 --> 00:57:57,409
- WAKE UP!!!

1180
00:57:57,411 --> 00:57:58,444
- Wake up!

1181
00:57:58,446 --> 00:58:00,081
- Wake the fuck up!

1182
00:58:09,724 --> 00:58:11,759
- Hey, you want to know
the secret to life?

1183
00:58:13,961 --> 00:58:15,361
- Moderation?

1184
00:58:15,363 --> 00:58:16,628
- Mm.

1185
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:19,598
Yeah, but no, it's this.

1186
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,069
So, see how it's the
same on both sides?

1187
00:58:23,337 --> 00:58:25,170
It's a bunch of
different colors.

1188
00:58:25,172 --> 00:58:26,972
Pick a number one through six.

1189
00:58:26,974 --> 00:58:28,009
- Four.

1190
00:58:28,909 --> 00:58:30,309
- Are you sure you
wanna stick with four

1191
00:58:30,311 --> 00:58:31,846
or you don't wanna
change your mind?

1192
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:34,480
- Okay, three.

1193
00:58:34,482 --> 00:58:35,781
- Oh three, okay.

1194
00:58:35,783 --> 00:58:37,316
We're gonna go one, two, three

1195
00:58:37,318 --> 00:58:38,250
and we land on
green, is that fair?

1196
00:58:38,252 --> 00:58:39,284
- Mm, hmm...

1197
00:58:39,286 --> 00:58:40,652
All right, hold your hand out.

1198
00:58:40,654 --> 00:58:42,488
Okay, so we're gonna
go one, two, "whoosh".

1199
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:43,856
There you go.

1200
00:58:43,858 --> 00:58:46,560
Green on both sides. Magic.

1201
00:58:50,598 --> 00:58:51,799
- How did you do that?

1202
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:55,267
- You get a piece of wood,
spray paint it black,

1203
00:58:55,269 --> 00:58:58,537
get a bunch of shitty 30 cent
gemstones that you glue to it.

1204
00:58:58,539 --> 00:59:00,472
And no matter what
you were gonna do,

1205
00:59:00,474 --> 00:59:02,341
I was just gonna force
the color green on you.

1206
00:59:02,343 --> 00:59:04,610
So you said four initially, if
you didn't change your mind,

1207
00:59:04,612 --> 00:59:06,612
I'd just go one, two,
three, four. Land on green,

1208
00:59:06,614 --> 00:59:07,746
but you changed it to three.

1209
00:59:07,748 --> 00:59:09,516
I gave you the
illusion of control.

1210
00:59:09,518 --> 00:59:10,616
So then I go one, two, three,

1211
00:59:10,618 --> 00:59:11,884
and I landed on green.

1212
00:59:11,886 --> 00:59:13,218
You could pick any number, five.

1213
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:15,320
I would just go F-I-V-E, green.

1214
00:59:15,322 --> 00:59:16,355
One, two, six,

1215
00:59:16,357 --> 00:59:18,390
O-N-E, T-W-O, S-I-X.

1216
00:59:18,392 --> 00:59:21,260
No matter what you do, I'm
gonna get you to land on green.

1217
00:59:21,262 --> 00:59:23,896
So, there you go, there's the
secret to life right there.

1218
00:59:23,898 --> 00:59:26,098
It doesn't matter what you do.

1219
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,132
- That's bullshit.

1220
00:59:27,134 --> 00:59:28,233
- Yeah, it is bullshit.

1221
00:59:28,235 --> 00:59:29,270
We finally agree on something.

1222
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:47,386
- Oh no, no, no, no, no

1223
00:59:47,388 --> 00:59:49,888
no, no, no, no, no, you can't.

1224
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:50,956
You can't.

1225
00:59:50,958 --> 00:59:52,224
You can't okay.

1226
00:59:52,226 --> 00:59:53,225
Okay, okay.

1227
00:59:53,227 --> 00:59:54,228
You okay?

1228
00:59:57,598 --> 00:59:59,066
Is this okay?

1229
01:00:01,302 --> 01:00:02,868
Okay, you're okay.

1230
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:05,206
You're okay, you
can't do that baby.

1231
01:00:05,574 --> 01:00:06,774
Okay?

1232
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:11,176
Okay, okay.

1233
01:00:11,178 --> 01:00:12,478
I'm sorry, okay.

1234
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,012
I'm sorry, sorry.

1235
01:00:14,014 --> 01:00:15,914
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1236
01:00:15,916 --> 01:00:17,685
I'll put this back on, okay?

1237
01:00:18,886 --> 01:00:19,854
Okay.

1238
01:00:20,688 --> 01:00:22,123
There you go.

1239
01:00:23,057 --> 01:00:24,291
There you go.

1240
01:00:25,226 --> 01:00:26,627
There you go.

1241
01:00:27,328 --> 01:00:28,360
Okay.

1242
01:00:28,362 --> 01:00:29,562
Okay.

1243
01:00:29,564 --> 01:00:30,929
Hey, uh Tristan.

1244
01:00:30,931 --> 01:00:32,798
Hey, what's going on?

1245
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:33,866
I need help.

1246
01:00:33,868 --> 01:00:34,867
This is it.

1247
01:00:34,869 --> 01:00:36,036
Okay...

1248
01:00:36,103 --> 01:00:38,070
- So you know, you
know Angel is really sick

1249
01:00:38,072 --> 01:00:40,072
and she only has
a few weeks left.

1250
01:00:40,074 --> 01:00:41,707
And I, I need help, I
need to go somewhere

1251
01:00:41,709 --> 01:00:42,975
but I don't wanna
leave her alone.

1252
01:00:42,977 --> 01:00:44,910
- I can help
you take care of Angel.

1253
01:00:44,912 --> 01:00:46,211
We'll figure this out.

1254
01:00:46,213 --> 01:00:49,047
I love dogs and I'll
gladly love on your dog--

1255
01:00:49,049 --> 01:00:50,482
I need you to stay
where you are.

1256
01:00:50,484 --> 01:00:51,984
You're at your
mom's house right?

1257
01:00:51,986 --> 01:00:53,952
How long ago did you take--

1258
01:00:56,023 --> 01:00:57,322
- I can't have you pass out-

1259
01:00:57,324 --> 01:00:58,991
- Stay on the phone.

1260
01:00:58,993 --> 01:01:01,228
- Do I need to
call an ambulance?

1261
01:01:02,263 --> 01:01:03,230
- Breathe out.

1262
01:01:04,431 --> 01:01:05,366
- Yeah just like that.

1263
01:01:16,944 --> 01:01:18,143
<i>- Why can't you stop?</i>

1264
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,580
I told him no drugs.

1265
01:01:20,582 --> 01:01:22,414
I am not having a druggie
here during Santa's presents.

1266
01:01:22,416 --> 01:01:23,884
There are gonna
be children here.

1267
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,286
I had one rule!

1268
01:01:27,288 --> 01:01:28,854
- - fucking kill him.

1269
01:01:28,856 --> 01:01:30,689
- Okay, what's going on?

1270
01:01:30,691 --> 01:01:32,525
- Right now,

1271
01:01:32,527 --> 01:01:34,594
this is what we
have to deal with.

1272
01:01:34,596 --> 01:01:36,128
How high he is.

1273
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:39,231
So every time you come in
saying that you're not high,

1274
01:01:39,233 --> 01:01:40,465
we can see-

1275
01:01:40,467 --> 01:01:42,067
Okay mom, relax.

1276
01:01:42,069 --> 01:01:44,870
I just walked into
the room, okay?

1277
01:01:44,872 --> 01:01:47,640
Hey, I, I haven't done
anything in months, okay.

1278
01:01:47,642 --> 01:01:49,642
I've been sober for four months.

1279
01:01:49,644 --> 01:01:50,909
- Sober three years.

1280
01:01:50,911 --> 01:01:53,078
- I've been sober for 28
years, so there's that.

1281
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,180
- That's a bunch of bullshit.

1282
01:01:55,182 --> 01:01:57,883
You smoked weed with Alex in
high school in the backyard.

1283
01:01:57,885 --> 01:01:59,985
- Oh, okay, because smoking
weed is the same thing

1284
01:01:59,987 --> 01:02:02,054
as doing opioids and Xanax.

1285
01:02:02,056 --> 01:02:03,222
Sure.

1286
01:02:03,224 --> 01:02:04,923
Haven't you smoked
meth a few times?

1287
01:02:04,925 --> 01:02:06,358
I am going to go and finish,
setting up Christmas.

1288
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,360
If anyone wants to join
me, please feel free.

1289
01:02:08,362 --> 01:02:09,363
- Yep.

1290
01:02:10,532 --> 01:02:11,598
- What?

1291
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:12,866
You fucking have.

1292
01:02:13,467 --> 01:02:15,035
He said you gave him the Xanax.

1293
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:17,402
- Wow.

1294
01:02:17,404 --> 01:02:20,272
If I had Xanax, I would
be on Xanax right now.

1295
01:02:20,274 --> 01:02:21,674
- That's what I said.

1296
01:02:21,676 --> 01:02:23,043
- No shit.

1297
01:02:23,511 --> 01:02:24,943
- Fuck him.

1298
01:02:24,945 --> 01:02:27,481
Let him rot, he'll wake
up when he wakes up.

1299
01:02:28,249 --> 01:02:29,314
He's slept on cardboard,

1300
01:02:29,316 --> 01:02:31,118
he can sleep on a
fucking wicker chair.

1301
01:03:52,199 --> 01:03:53,365
- Hi, Mr. Bradley

1302
01:03:53,367 --> 01:03:54,466
This is Sherry

1303
01:03:54,468 --> 01:03:56,335
from Dr. Rose's animal clinic.

1304
01:03:56,337 --> 01:03:58,103
This is a courtesy
call letting you know

1305
01:03:58,105 --> 01:04:00,472
that Angel's remains
are available for pickup

1306
01:04:00,474 --> 01:04:02,140
here at the office.

1307
01:04:02,142 --> 01:04:04,109
And it goes without saying
that the entire staff here

1308
01:04:04,111 --> 01:04:06,378
is so sorry for your loss.

1309
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:07,448
All the very best.

1310
01:04:09,316 --> 01:04:10,516
Love you bud,

1311
01:04:10,518 --> 01:04:12,150
saw your post about Angel.

1312
01:04:12,152 --> 01:04:14,853
Ah, just wanted to call and
say, Hey, and just, you know,

1313
01:04:14,855 --> 01:04:15,887
see how you're doing.

1314
01:04:15,889 --> 01:04:16,888
Love you bud.

1315
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:18,125
Talk you later.

1316
01:04:18,258 --> 01:04:21,026
Your puppy went
floating to nestle in clouds.

1317
01:04:21,028 --> 01:04:23,862
Together with God, we
will work this all out.

1318
01:04:23,864 --> 01:04:28,133
You wish it was you and
truth be told, it should.

1319
01:04:28,135 --> 01:04:31,002
That dog was perfection,
you've done nothing good.

1320
01:04:31,004 --> 01:04:34,005
You finally found your
fix it or fuck it.

1321
01:04:34,007 --> 01:04:36,475
So peel off that glue
and let's get unstuck it.

1322
01:04:36,477 --> 01:04:39,344
Don't worry so much
because life's a parade.

1323
01:04:39,346 --> 01:04:41,213
You still have a handful
of cards yet to play.

1324
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:43,750
So go on you big dummy
and don't be afraid.

1325
01:04:43,752 --> 01:04:45,417
Blah, blah,
motivational bullshit.

1326
01:04:45,419 --> 01:04:47,555
Namaste.

1327
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:53,528
- I don't know how to quiet
the voices in my head.

1328
01:04:54,562 --> 01:04:56,430
It's really difficult for me.

1329
01:04:58,399 --> 01:05:01,935
My brain is like, like
a popcorn machine.

1330
01:05:03,505 --> 01:05:04,871
Fireworks.

1331
01:05:04,873 --> 01:05:07,207
A bunch of hyenas
fighting for attention.

1332
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:11,844
If a situation
upsets you, you leave it,

1333
01:05:11,846 --> 01:05:13,945
you change it, or accept it.

1334
01:05:13,947 --> 01:05:15,447
You are in control.

1335
01:05:16,383 --> 01:05:17,949
<i>Why can't you stop?</i>

1336
01:05:17,951 --> 01:05:19,384
Try again.

1337
01:05:19,386 --> 01:05:20,919
Try again.

1338
01:05:20,921 --> 01:05:23,457
You are
in control, breathe.

1339
01:05:25,426 --> 01:05:26,427
- I'm crumbling.

1340
01:05:27,862 --> 01:05:29,229
I'm falling apart.

1341
01:05:30,931 --> 01:05:33,231
And I know I'm supposed
to put my faith in God

1342
01:05:33,233 --> 01:05:34,801
and everything with
the program says,

1343
01:05:34,803 --> 01:05:38,036
you got to put your faith in
God, but my whole family's gone.

1344
01:05:38,038 --> 01:05:40,673
<i>Okay.</i>

1345
01:05:40,675 --> 01:05:42,374
And I miss my mom.

1346
01:05:42,376 --> 01:05:44,244
<i>Everything'a gonna be alright.</i>

1347
01:05:44,978 --> 01:05:47,112
- You know how sometimes
like you're sick

1348
01:05:47,114 --> 01:05:49,816
and you just really
need your mom.

1349
01:05:49,818 --> 01:05:53,018
You just really need your mom.

1350
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:54,722
And I miss my dog.

1351
01:06:00,294 --> 01:06:02,595
Oh I miss my
fucking dog so much.

1352
01:06:02,597 --> 01:06:04,229
<i>- If you don't</i>
<i>fucking call me back,</i>

1353
01:06:04,231 --> 01:06:05,865
<i>I'm gonna call the cops to do a</i>

1354
01:06:05,867 --> 01:06:07,332
<i>fucking wellness check</i>
<i>on your ass okay?</i>

1355
01:06:07,334 --> 01:06:11,069
<i>Leave it.</i>
<i>Change it! OR ACCEPT IT!</i>

1356
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:14,709
<i>YOU are in control.</i>

1357
01:06:23,618 --> 01:06:25,350
- You act like
I, I haven't been here.

1358
01:06:25,352 --> 01:06:29,622
You don't under- I remember
him when he was a little boy.

1359
01:06:29,624 --> 01:06:30,690
He was everything good.

1360
01:06:30,692 --> 01:06:32,090
He was all goodness.

1361
01:06:32,092 --> 01:06:33,358
I know it is still in him.

1362
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:36,361
I, I see it when he's
high for Christ's sake.

1363
01:06:36,363 --> 01:06:38,131
- If you baby him, you bury him.

1364
01:06:41,001 --> 01:06:43,101
- It's not his fault,
it's a disease.

1365
01:06:43,103 --> 01:06:44,837
- Oh, can you stop
calling it a disease?

1366
01:06:44,839 --> 01:06:46,404
He doesn't have a
fucking disease.

1367
01:06:46,406 --> 01:06:48,508
Cystic fibrosis is a disease.

1368
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:49,942
Lungs fucking failing.

1369
01:06:49,944 --> 01:06:53,411
24-7 sick, cancer,
Alzheimer's, all diseases.

1370
01:06:53,413 --> 01:06:54,479
Mom.

1371
01:06:54,481 --> 01:06:55,882
He's an addict.

1372
01:06:55,884 --> 01:06:59,317
If he just stops doing
drugs, he's cured.

1373
01:06:59,319 --> 01:07:00,586
Stop calling it a disease.

1374
01:07:00,588 --> 01:07:02,624
He just has no
fucking self control.

1375
01:07:03,691 --> 01:07:05,390
- I don't understand how you
can say things like that.

1376
01:07:05,392 --> 01:07:07,560
- Mom, if one of us was
married to a fuck-up,

1377
01:07:07,562 --> 01:07:09,964
you would be saying
the same shit to us.

1378
01:07:10,364 --> 01:07:12,264
- I guess it's different
when it's your kid.

1379
01:07:12,266 --> 01:07:13,465
- Okay,
well he's our brother

1380
01:07:13,467 --> 01:07:15,968
and I refuse to feel
bad for him anymore.

1381
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:17,003
As far as I'm concerned,

1382
01:07:17,005 --> 01:07:18,203
he's just some other asshole

1383
01:07:18,205 --> 01:07:21,339
that keeps breaking my
mom's fucking heart.

1384
01:07:21,341 --> 01:07:23,578
And until he stops,
he can fuck right off.

1385
01:07:24,746 --> 01:07:27,013
And here we are again,
cleaning up his mess.

1386
01:07:27,015 --> 01:07:28,113
Can you explain to me

1387
01:07:28,115 --> 01:07:29,515
why we're taking care
of this right shit now?

1388
01:07:29,517 --> 01:07:31,017
He doesn't give a fuck
about any of this stuff.

1389
01:07:31,019 --> 01:07:32,952
Why should we?

1390
01:07:32,954 --> 01:07:34,154
- Okay, just.

1391
01:07:40,562 --> 01:07:41,563
- Hey mom?

1392
01:07:44,032 --> 01:07:46,233
Mom, can you look at me
for one second please?

1393
01:07:48,736 --> 01:07:50,103
Hey, mom, please.

1394
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:56,811
Brianna and I were talking,

1395
01:07:59,714 --> 01:08:02,147
and you need to stop doing this.

1396
01:08:02,149 --> 01:08:04,686
You can't keep doing
this anymore, alright?

1397
01:08:05,987 --> 01:08:07,454
This is your intervention now.

1398
01:08:08,823 --> 01:08:10,990
So you, you need to choose.

1399
01:08:10,992 --> 01:08:12,525
Dylan is killing you
with his sickness

1400
01:08:12,527 --> 01:08:15,128
and he's not going to stop
if you keep enabling him.

1401
01:08:17,297 --> 01:08:19,732
So, do you want a
relationship with Dylan

1402
01:08:19,734 --> 01:08:22,635
or do you want a relationship
with me and Brianna?

1403
01:08:22,637 --> 01:08:24,706
Because you can't have
all three anymore.

1404
01:08:26,007 --> 01:08:28,741
Not until Dylan gets
his shit together.

1405
01:08:28,743 --> 01:08:30,408
- He hasn't gotten his shit
together in two decades,

1406
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:32,310
you think he's gonna start now?

1407
01:08:32,312 --> 01:08:35,413
- Briana can you maybe help
for two fucking seconds please?

1408
01:08:35,415 --> 01:08:36,582
- Maybe I'm just sick

1409
01:08:36,584 --> 01:08:38,283
of living in the
fucking Twilight Zone

1410
01:08:38,285 --> 01:08:41,689
and we keep having to do this
shit over and over again!

1411
01:08:42,489 --> 01:08:45,256
Um well, so you think
you're in control,

1412
01:08:45,258 --> 01:08:47,325
but you never are.

1413
01:08:47,327 --> 01:08:48,794
- Wait, that's dad's trick.

1414
01:08:48,796 --> 01:08:50,863
You shouldn't be telling
people how to do that trick.

1415
01:08:50,865 --> 01:08:52,330
It takes the fun out of it.

1416
01:08:52,332 --> 01:08:54,700
Magic isn't very magical if
you know how the trick is done.

1417
01:08:54,702 --> 01:08:56,267
- All right, well you
told me to tell you.

1418
01:08:56,269 --> 01:08:57,837
- Since when do you
listen to what I say?

1419
01:08:57,839 --> 01:08:59,705
- The whole point is on
that side of the table,

1420
01:08:59,707 --> 01:09:01,040
you don't stand a chance.

1421
01:09:01,042 --> 01:09:02,508
So go ahead, go fuck
around on your phone,

1422
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:04,142
comb your hair, obey speed
limits, go to church,

1423
01:09:04,144 --> 01:09:05,745
it doesn't matter what you do.

1424
01:09:05,747 --> 01:09:07,278
We're all ending up
in the same spot.

1425
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,246
So like, what's the point?

1426
01:09:08,248 --> 01:09:10,148
Why should we try so hard?

1427
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:11,917
- Okay.

1428
01:09:11,919 --> 01:09:13,052
What if I didn't pick a number?

1429
01:09:13,054 --> 01:09:14,354
What if I picked a color?

1430
01:09:16,724 --> 01:09:18,223
- I, I don't know.

1431
01:09:18,225 --> 01:09:19,825
I didn't ask you
to pick a color.

1432
01:09:19,827 --> 01:09:21,027
I asked you to pick a number.

1433
01:09:21,029 --> 01:09:23,095
- I know that, but
what I'm saying is,

1434
01:09:23,097 --> 01:09:24,429
is what if you sat
down to do the trick

1435
01:09:24,431 --> 01:09:25,798
and showed me that rainbow stick

1436
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,399
and I jumped in before
you could say anything.

1437
01:09:27,401 --> 01:09:29,467
So I was like, oh, I love blue.

1438
01:09:29,469 --> 01:09:31,637
I don't want green, green
is the color of puke.

1439
01:09:31,639 --> 01:09:32,940
I want blue.

1440
01:09:34,441 --> 01:09:37,275
- Um then I just, I
just wouldn't the trick.

1441
01:09:37,277 --> 01:09:38,746
- Then I win.

1442
01:09:39,047 --> 01:09:40,311
- It's not about winning.

1443
01:09:40,313 --> 01:09:41,747
It's a metaphor for
how life isn't fair.

1444
01:09:41,749 --> 01:09:42,948
- If I pick blue, I win.

1445
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:43,918
I crack the code.

1446
01:09:44,085 --> 01:09:47,520
So you're stupid because you
keep saying I'm not in control,

1447
01:09:47,522 --> 01:09:48,523
but I am.

1448
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:54,860
See, this is why there's
no female magicians.

1449
01:09:54,862 --> 01:09:56,864
We figure shit out too quickly.

1450
01:10:59,794 --> 01:11:02,697
He would hide
little notes for us to find.

1451
01:11:16,911 --> 01:11:19,514
- I uh, I think I'm supposed
to bring this to you.

1452
01:11:20,347 --> 01:11:21,747
- Oh my God, Turbo.

1453
01:11:21,749 --> 01:11:23,048
You figured it out.

1454
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:25,251
Four pills that you wrote
on a million months ago

1455
01:11:25,253 --> 01:11:26,519
with a Sharpie,

1456
01:11:26,521 --> 01:11:28,020
that is the answer we've
been talking about.

1457
01:11:28,022 --> 01:11:29,054
Well done.

1458
01:11:29,056 --> 01:11:30,388
Hey guys!
He figured it out!

1459
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:31,891
- Yay he did it!

1460
01:11:31,893 --> 01:11:32,992
- Yeah boy.

1461
01:11:32,994 --> 01:11:34,760
- I knew he could do it,
with that big dick, Dylan.

1462
01:11:34,762 --> 01:11:36,028
- Big dick Dylan!

1463
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:37,096
- Sounds like a good time

1464
01:11:37,098 --> 01:11:38,463
for a victory
grilled cheese, buddy.

1465
01:11:38,465 --> 01:11:39,565
- I don't know, man.

1466
01:11:39,567 --> 01:11:41,466
Maybe it's not a
literal key, you need-

1467
01:11:41,468 --> 01:11:43,669
- It's a literal code, it's
a literal key code, hoss.

1468
01:11:43,671 --> 01:11:48,007
All right, you are acting
like a re- really dumb person.

1469
01:11:48,009 --> 01:11:49,008
- Golden Door!

1470
01:11:49,010 --> 01:11:51,243
That is not the Golden
Door we all know and love.

1471
01:11:51,245 --> 01:11:53,078
That is frustration
talking Goldie.

1472
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,280
- You know what, you're right.

1473
01:11:54,282 --> 01:11:55,281
That's not me guys.

1474
01:11:55,283 --> 01:11:56,447
That's not who I am.

1475
01:11:56,449 --> 01:11:57,783
I'm always learning.

1476
01:11:57,785 --> 01:11:59,285
And please give me
thoughts and prayers

1477
01:11:59,287 --> 01:12:00,485
during this difficult time.

1478
01:12:00,487 --> 01:12:01,887
But Dylan -- mm -- hang on...

1479
01:12:01,889 --> 01:12:03,925
what's a, I need a
stupid name for you.

1480
01:12:04,457 --> 01:12:06,058
Try again, Big Dog.

1481
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:07,159
Think hard.

1482
01:12:07,161 --> 01:12:08,459
Pick a number.

1483
01:12:08,461 --> 01:12:10,565
and plug it in right
above my door dick.

1484
01:12:14,101 --> 01:12:15,701
- You want me to pick a number?

1485
01:12:15,703 --> 01:12:17,570
- When you repeat
what I say back to me?

1486
01:12:17,572 --> 01:12:19,404
- Yeah why are you
repeating things Dylan?

1487
01:12:19,406 --> 01:12:20,371
It makes me feel a
little frustrated.

1488
01:12:20,373 --> 01:12:21,707
- What's going on?

1489
01:12:21,709 --> 01:12:22,775
- Try again.

1490
01:12:22,777 --> 01:12:23,742
- Open up.

1491
01:12:23,744 --> 01:12:24,510
- Try again.

1492
01:12:24,512 --> 01:12:25,578
- Pick a number.

1493
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:26,545
- You're all dead to me anyways.

1494
01:12:26,547 --> 01:12:27,648
- Oh, we're dead to you?

1495
01:12:27,715 --> 01:12:28,747
- We're not gonna
lose you let's go!

1496
01:12:28,749 --> 01:12:30,249
- Think hard.
Plug it in there.

1497
01:12:30,251 --> 01:12:31,349
- Was that mean of me? Making--

1498
01:12:31,351 --> 01:12:32,985
- You are in control.

1499
01:12:32,987 --> 01:12:34,820
- You can do
this, you're so strong.

1500
01:12:34,822 --> 01:12:36,121
- What do you mean
you can't help me?

1501
01:12:36,123 --> 01:12:37,590
- You have to re-spawn yourself.

1502
01:12:37,592 --> 01:12:39,424
- Are you
realizing something?

1503
01:12:39,426 --> 01:12:40,493
Is that what this is?

1504
01:12:40,628 --> 01:12:41,929
- I wanna see if
I can figure it out sober.

1505
01:12:53,074 --> 01:12:54,108
- Breath in.

1506
01:12:54,175 --> 01:12:56,508
- Stay focused here, let's
keep your head in the game.

1507
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:57,879
We got this. Stay focused.

1508
01:12:58,312 --> 01:12:59,545
- BREATHE!

1509
01:12:59,547 --> 01:13:01,347
- Why have
you not been LISTENING?!

1510
01:13:01,349 --> 01:13:02,581
We got this. Stay focused.

1511
01:13:19,333 --> 01:13:22,167
- Ahh!

1512
01:13:34,081 --> 01:13:35,583
- All right.

1513
01:13:37,218 --> 01:13:38,817
Hi mom.

1514
01:13:38,819 --> 01:13:39,818
Briana.

1515
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:40,955
Lilly.

1516
01:13:43,357 --> 01:13:44,924
Okay.

1517
01:13:44,926 --> 01:13:48,794
I got into magic after I got
my right index finger cut off.

1518
01:13:48,796 --> 01:13:52,765
When I was little, you know,
it was a boat accident,

1519
01:13:52,767 --> 01:13:55,770
had a boat load of
stitches, pun intended.

1520
01:13:56,503 --> 01:13:57,638
Dad joke.

1521
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:02,775
So my physical therapy was
grabbing a foam softball,

1522
01:14:02,777 --> 01:14:04,610
foam golf ball,
and then, you know,

1523
01:14:04,612 --> 01:14:05,878
picking up a single card.

1524
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:07,980
Because I don't have any
feeling from here forward.

1525
01:14:07,982 --> 01:14:10,182
And so I got really
good at shuffling cards

1526
01:14:10,184 --> 01:14:12,753
because it me gave something
for my anxiety brain to do.

1527
01:14:12,987 --> 01:14:14,386
Dad gave me a lot.

1528
01:14:14,388 --> 01:14:16,522
Why it's important
to donate blood.

1529
01:14:16,524 --> 01:14:17,556
My love of hockey.

1530
01:14:17,558 --> 01:14:18,891
I mean, half of my childhood

1531
01:14:18,893 --> 01:14:21,494
is us playing one-on-one
tournaments in the front.

1532
01:14:31,471 --> 01:14:32,907
I was a terrible son.

1533
01:14:34,575 --> 01:14:35,710
A worse brother.

1534
01:14:36,744 --> 01:14:38,579
The definition of selfish.

1535
01:14:40,314 --> 01:14:41,248
I'm ashamed.

1536
01:14:42,383 --> 01:14:43,949
Truly.

1537
01:14:43,951 --> 01:14:47,086
I don't ever want to go back
to that version of myself.

1538
01:14:47,088 --> 01:14:48,620
I want to matter.

1539
01:14:48,622 --> 01:14:50,356
I want to help.

1540
01:14:50,358 --> 01:14:53,292
I want to be a kick-ass grandpa

1541
01:14:53,294 --> 01:14:54,827
telling stories to my grandkids.

1542
01:14:54,829 --> 01:14:56,628
And you know, when I die,

1543
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:59,000
I want my story to be
one about perseverance.

1544
01:15:01,335 --> 01:15:03,237
Maybe it'll help for being,

1545
01:15:05,639 --> 01:15:08,609
such a bad person

1546
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:11,078
for so long.

1547
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:37,204
Well now what?

1548
01:19:29,571 --> 01:19:31,338
- I did it.

1549
01:19:43,718 --> 01:19:45,718
- Hey,
you've got Dylan Bradley.

1550
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:47,419
If this is a
professional phone call,

1551
01:19:47,421 --> 01:19:49,021
please leave a detailed message.

1552
01:19:49,023 --> 01:19:50,422
If this is a personal call,

1553
01:19:50,424 --> 01:19:53,091
please profess your love
to me after the beep.

1554
01:19:54,729 --> 01:19:56,461
- Hey dude. Um...

1555
01:19:56,463 --> 01:19:57,829
Sorry for calling so early.

1556
01:19:57,831 --> 01:19:58,964
The kids have...

1557
01:19:58,966 --> 01:20:00,365
...been awake all morning

1558
01:20:00,367 --> 01:20:01,601
Um...

1559
01:20:02,671 --> 01:20:04,236
Okay, I'm gonna cut the shit.

1560
01:20:04,238 --> 01:20:08,541
There's still a lot of anger
here and it's tough, okay?

1561
01:20:08,543 --> 01:20:11,511
But, I just wanted
to let you know,

1562
01:20:11,513 --> 01:20:13,713
I'm proud of you.

1563
01:20:13,715 --> 01:20:15,247
Honestly, I didn't
think you'd do it,

1564
01:20:15,249 --> 01:20:17,951
so gotta give credit
where credit's due, huh?

1565
01:20:18,819 --> 01:20:20,419
I'm glad you're well.

1566
01:20:20,421 --> 01:20:21,322
Merry Christmas.

1567
01:20:22,122 --> 01:20:23,955
Oh, hey, Mom and Lilly want to,

1568
01:20:23,957 --> 01:20:25,991
<i>hold on, yeah can I finish?</i>

1569
01:20:25,993 --> 01:20:27,328
<i>I'm gonna let you talk.</i>

1570
01:20:30,130 --> 01:20:31,830
<i>No, its a voicemail.</i>

1571
01:20:31,832 --> 01:20:34,034
<i>No, he didn't answer.</i>
<i>It's a voicemail.</i>

1572
01:20:34,602 --> 01:20:35,901
<i>Take the phone!</i>

1573
01:20:41,041 --> 01:20:42,709
- Wait, wait, wait.

1574
01:20:42,711 --> 01:20:45,045
I got, I gotta call my mom.

1575
01:20:46,847 --> 01:20:48,516
I gotta call my mom.

1576
01:20:51,485 --> 01:20:52,453
Mommy.

1577
01:23:31,278 --> 01:23:32,945
So this will go back here?

1578
01:23:32,947 --> 01:23:34,479
Yes.

1579
01:23:34,481 --> 01:23:36,549
We like put that here for
like the extra?--

1580
01:23:36,551 --> 01:23:38,183
- Hi big brother.

1581
01:23:38,185 --> 01:23:39,621
- This looks really cool

1582
01:23:40,822 --> 01:23:42,722
Do you wanna tell
me what you built?

1583
01:23:42,724 --> 01:23:44,924
- It's not a time machine.

1584
01:23:44,926 --> 01:23:46,091
- Is it a magic trick?

1585
01:23:46,093 --> 01:23:48,426
- No, it's more like happiness,

1586
01:23:48,428 --> 01:23:51,764
a superstition, and
aluminum foil in a box.

1587
01:23:51,766 --> 01:23:52,665
- How does it work?

1588
01:23:52,667 --> 01:23:55,200
- Well you get five
minutes to go back in time

1589
01:23:55,202 --> 01:23:57,402
to whatever time you want
with somebody who's dead.

1590
01:23:57,404 --> 01:23:59,939
- We chose dad since he's
the only dead person we know.

1591
01:23:59,941 --> 01:24:02,073
- Grandpa told us that
when somebody dies,

1592
01:24:02,075 --> 01:24:03,843
you only get one
memory to return to

1593
01:24:03,845 --> 01:24:05,277
where it's crystal clear.

1594
01:24:05,279 --> 01:24:07,947
The rest of them get fuzzy
and hard to remember.

1595
01:24:07,949 --> 01:24:11,951
Usually people's voices are the
first to go, or their laugh.

1596
01:24:11,953 --> 01:24:14,687
But the memory is
still there, repeating.

1597
01:24:14,689 --> 01:24:17,088
Like when dad's old
CD player would skip.

1598
01:24:17,090 --> 01:24:19,157
- You go outside where
Heaven can see you

1599
01:24:19,159 --> 01:24:21,259
and you grab something
they gave you.

1600
01:24:21,261 --> 01:24:22,460
So like Bear-Bear.

1601
01:24:22,462 --> 01:24:24,329
And you think back
before dad was sick.

1602
01:24:24,331 --> 01:24:26,632
So instead of him hurting
in the hospital bed,

1603
01:24:26,634 --> 01:24:30,903
he can be fixing our
fridge or holding our hands

1604
01:24:30,905 --> 01:24:32,605
while we go to the
movies or something.

1605
01:24:32,607 --> 01:24:33,775
- Or tying our skates.

1606
01:25:46,114 --> 01:25:47,381
- Hi Angel.

1607
01:26:07,835 --> 01:26:09,403
- Whoa! you're up.

1608
01:26:11,238 --> 01:26:12,905
- Can I help?

1609
01:26:12,907 --> 01:26:14,272
- Can you help?

1610
01:26:14,274 --> 01:26:16,241
Heck yes, you can help.

1611
01:26:16,243 --> 01:26:17,877
What do you wanna do,
you wanna wash or dry?

1612
01:26:17,879 --> 01:26:19,645
- Yeah, can I wash?

1613
01:26:19,647 --> 01:26:22,615
- Yeah, absolutely step
in, okay.

1614
01:26:22,617 --> 01:26:23,685
- Oh my gosh.

1615
01:26:24,919 --> 01:26:26,317
There we go, is that good?

1616
01:26:26,319 --> 01:26:27,722
- It's beautiful.

1617
01:26:29,123 --> 01:26:31,256
- All in there.

1618
01:26:31,258 --> 01:26:32,525
- Yeah, you got it.

1619
01:26:32,527 --> 01:26:34,794
Dig in, you got cocoa
all over that thing.

1620
01:26:34,796 --> 01:26:38,331
- Yeah.

1621
01:26:40,034 --> 01:26:42,603
Thanks for a great Christmas.

1622
01:26:43,203 --> 01:26:44,772
- Thank you son.

1623
01:26:49,143 --> 01:26:50,645
- I love you, dad.

1624
01:26:56,416 --> 01:26:57,752
- I love you too kid.

1625
01:27:07,962 --> 01:27:09,997
Thanks for cleaning up.

1626
01:27:21,075 --> 01:27:22,810
- Okay, rinse it out.

1627
01:27:23,911 --> 01:27:25,044
And grab another one.

1628
01:27:25,046 --> 01:27:26,279
You got this.

1629
01:27:32,053 --> 01:27:34,153
You're getting
pretty good at this.

1630
01:27:34,155 --> 01:27:36,222
- What are you
doing on New Years Eve?

1631
01:28:33,014 --> 01:28:39,317
- ♪ to you,
happy birthday to you,

1632
01:28:39,319 --> 01:28:45,057
