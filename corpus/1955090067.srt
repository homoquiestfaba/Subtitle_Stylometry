1
00:01:39,911 --> 00:01:41,381
Ray.

2
00:01:41,414 --> 00:01:42,347
Ray.

3
00:01:46,424 --> 00:01:47,792
Ray, Ray, Ray...

4
00:01:47,826 --> 00:01:48,760
Home's the other way.

5
00:01:48,795 --> 00:01:50,331
Remember?

6
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:13,339
I gotta go!

7
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:16,245
Go ahead, DeeDee.

8
00:02:17,882 --> 00:02:20,787
I gotta go!

9
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,692
I said, go ahead, DeeDee!

10
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,335
Kent?

11
00:02:46,368 --> 00:02:47,937
You awake?

12
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:49,307
Kent?

13
00:02:52,447 --> 00:02:53,748
Good morning.

14
00:02:55,953 --> 00:02:59,393
Here, take two of these.

15
00:03:01,896 --> 00:03:03,132
There you go.

16
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:04,099
Here.

17
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:11,848
What? No more vikes?

18
00:03:11,883 --> 00:03:14,721
Kent, you gotta take your
meds when you're supposed

19
00:03:14,754 --> 00:03:16,858
to or you're gonna
run out of them.

20
00:03:16,893 --> 00:03:18,395
I mean it.

21
00:03:19,431 --> 00:03:20,733
Here.

22
00:03:26,242 --> 00:03:28,379
This rash doesn't look so good.

23
00:03:35,592 --> 00:03:36,594
Hey!

24
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:38,667
I'm done!

25
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:53,659
Hey, Todd. Todd!

26
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:55,830
I'm moving it in a sec.
Don't worry about it.

27
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,902
Todd, wait.

28
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:02,177
She's screaming
a lot today.

29
00:04:02,211 --> 00:04:03,312
I'll see what I can do.

30
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:04,780
Now I don't wanna
have to do it.

31
00:04:04,814 --> 00:04:08,487
But if she doesn't stop,
I'm going to call the police.

32
00:04:08,521 --> 00:04:10,658
Lucky for you, here I am.

33
00:04:10,693 --> 00:04:12,896
Ha! That says reserves.

34
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,467
You're not a real cop.

35
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,870
Real enough to arrest
you for trespassing.

36
00:04:16,903 --> 00:04:19,442
Now get off our property.

37
00:04:21,745 --> 00:04:23,281
Get off our property.

38
00:04:23,314 --> 00:04:25,952
Parks his damn bus in
my driveway every day.

39
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,835
How's the aquarium coming?

40
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,540
Leaks, spills.

41
00:04:54,574 --> 00:04:57,444
You gotta take everything
into consideration.

42
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,651
Yes, sir.

43
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:02,923
Complex.

44
00:05:02,956 --> 00:05:04,791
What's complex about it?

45
00:05:04,826 --> 00:05:07,363
Nothing, I was just...

46
00:05:07,398 --> 00:05:09,936
It just seems like you're
doing a ton of work on it.

47
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:10,803
Got your laundry, Todd.

48
00:05:10,838 --> 00:05:12,274
Thanks, ma.

49
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,247
Yeah, another one of these
Gulf War veterans died and

50
00:05:16,281 --> 00:05:17,382
they don't know why.

51
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,651
Cause unknown.

52
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:19,786
Let me see that.

53
00:05:19,822 --> 00:05:22,293
She's getting into
the walls again.

54
00:05:22,326 --> 00:05:24,362
Cause unknown,
my Irish ass.

55
00:05:24,396 --> 00:05:26,366
What the hell is she doing
inside those walls anyway,

56
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,902
for Christ's sakes?

57
00:05:27,937 --> 00:05:28,770
Who's in the walls?

58
00:05:28,803 --> 00:05:29,838
Your sister.

59
00:05:29,874 --> 00:05:32,044
There's nothing
in these walls.

60
00:05:33,312 --> 00:05:34,915
No insulation.

61
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:36,985
Things rattle
around, maybe a mouse.

62
00:05:37,021 --> 00:05:39,758
How your parents bought a
house with no insulation,

63
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:40,993
I'll never understand.

64
00:05:41,995 --> 00:05:42,461
You gonna...

65
00:05:42,497 --> 00:05:44,399
Give me the phone.

66
00:05:49,343 --> 00:05:50,712
Yeah, hello.

67
00:05:52,048 --> 00:05:54,385
Well how do you
know that for sure?

68
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:57,325
Right.

69
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:58,091
Okay.

70
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,827
Alright. Bye.

71
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:03,535
Willy Crum is fooling
with DeeDee again.

72
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:05,439
I heard it on the news
so it must be true.

73
00:06:05,473 --> 00:06:07,375
Yeah, big joke.

74
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,045
Fooling?

75
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:09,745
What do you mean fooling?

76
00:06:09,781 --> 00:06:10,615
It's nothing.

77
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:11,548
Settle down.

78
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:12,718
That was the box factory.

79
00:06:12,754 --> 00:06:13,789
They're tired of it.

80
00:06:13,822 --> 00:06:14,956
Who the hell are
the box factory?

81
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,461
Who the hell are they?

82
00:06:17,495 --> 00:06:18,596
What's he doing?

83
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,598
Nothing, it's nothing.

84
00:06:19,632 --> 00:06:20,367
Now stop it.

85
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:20,901
I'm gonna slap him.

86
00:06:20,935 --> 00:06:21,969
No, you're not.

87
00:06:22,002 --> 00:06:23,605
He's retarded
for god's sakes.

88
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:24,941
I don't care that
he's retarded.

89
00:06:24,975 --> 00:06:27,612
Willy Crum. Willy coming?

90
00:06:27,648 --> 00:06:28,717
Hey, sweetie, look at you.

91
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,783
You got dressed.

92
00:06:29,817 --> 00:06:30,819
Good girl.

93
00:06:30,853 --> 00:06:31,788
Where Willy?

94
00:06:31,822 --> 00:06:33,623
-Sweetheart.
-Let me get you some breakfast.

95
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:36,062
Sweetheart, you gotta
stay out of the walls.

96
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,398
I'm not. Where Willy?

97
00:06:37,432 --> 00:06:38,567
Come and sit down.

98
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,002
DeeDee, is that guy
messing with you?

99
00:06:40,036 --> 00:06:41,038
I'm not.

100
00:06:41,072 --> 00:06:42,108
Bathroom!

101
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:43,442
-Bathroom!
-Just sit down.

102
00:06:43,476 --> 00:06:44,111
Sweetie.

103
00:06:44,146 --> 00:06:45,615
No bathroom now.

104
00:06:45,648 --> 00:06:46,349
Bathroom.

105
00:06:46,382 --> 00:06:48,051
-No bathroom now.
-Bathroom.

106
00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:49,821
-DeeDee...
-No, bathroom.

107
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,856
Alright, alright.

108
00:06:50,891 --> 00:06:52,360
-Take it easy. Take it easy.
-Leave her alone.

109
00:06:52,394 --> 00:06:53,930
DeeDee. DeeDee.
Ed, leave her alone!

110
00:06:55,567 --> 00:06:56,400
DeeDee, don't.

111
00:06:56,434 --> 00:06:59,072
I'm going to the bathroom.

112
00:06:59,107 --> 00:07:00,040
Now that's enough.
That's enough!

113
00:07:00,074 --> 00:07:00,941
No, bathroom!

114
00:07:00,975 --> 00:07:01,776
I am warning you!

115
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,747
-Going to bathroom.
-Now stop it!

116
00:07:03,781 --> 00:07:05,517
Ed, do you remember what
happened the last time you

117
00:07:05,552 --> 00:07:06,887
tried to stop her?

118
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,858
Bathroom!

119
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:11,495
DeeDee.

120
00:07:24,786 --> 00:07:26,355
-I got it.
-Okay.

121
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:27,759
Alright, that's good.

122
00:07:27,793 --> 00:07:29,362
-You got it?
-Yeah.

123
00:07:29,396 --> 00:07:31,432
Would someone
come up here?

124
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,073
Are you okay, Kent?

125
00:07:36,076 --> 00:07:36,843
Hey, hey.

126
00:07:36,877 --> 00:07:38,513
Hey, you alright?

127
00:07:41,084 --> 00:07:44,024
I've been better.

128
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:49,533
Pain.

129
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:52,472
No, I got it.

130
00:07:53,608 --> 00:07:55,644
Just help me...

131
00:07:55,678 --> 00:07:58,617
Get around the base.

132
00:08:03,059 --> 00:08:05,862
I've been killing
it on reserves.

133
00:08:05,898 --> 00:08:08,502
I was out with these
two cops last night.

134
00:08:08,535 --> 00:08:10,138
I made three arrests.

135
00:08:10,172 --> 00:08:14,914
I almost took out my
gun, but I didn't.

136
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,355
I wish you'd seen it.

137
00:08:21,091 --> 00:08:23,495
Mind if I smoke?

138
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:24,899
No.

139
00:08:25,701 --> 00:08:28,774
DeeDee's acting up again.

140
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:30,744
Insane.

141
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:34,014
She...

142
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:35,785
She knocked dad
right on his ass.

143
00:08:38,658 --> 00:08:40,729
Aw, I wish I
could've seen that.

144
00:08:42,532 --> 00:08:43,968
He went down
like a ton of bricks.

145
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:49,077
Smashed together.

146
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,848
Nope, no, no, nope.

147
00:08:51,883 --> 00:08:55,187
I got it. I got it. I got it.
I got it. I got it.

148
00:08:55,222 --> 00:08:56,156
Okay.

149
00:08:58,995 --> 00:09:01,033
Check it out.

150
00:09:02,903 --> 00:09:04,474
What?

151
00:09:05,075 --> 00:09:06,443
What is it?

152
00:09:06,476 --> 00:09:08,145
You remember?

153
00:09:09,014 --> 00:09:12,455
You shut 'em out
and had four hits.

154
00:09:13,022 --> 00:09:15,158
You were great.

155
00:09:15,193 --> 00:09:17,798
That was the night everybody
said you were going to the show.

156
00:09:17,831 --> 00:09:19,600
Todd.

157
00:09:19,634 --> 00:09:20,903
Todd.

158
00:09:21,672 --> 00:09:23,609
Can I have the cigarette?

159
00:09:24,845 --> 00:09:27,016
Yes, here.

160
00:09:30,054 --> 00:09:32,458
Man.

161
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,698
You should do
something with this.

162
00:09:53,231 --> 00:09:54,966
I'll see you in a little
while, champ, alright?

163
00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:15,671
I'm not really gonna
call the cops, Todd.

164
00:10:15,705 --> 00:10:18,576
But hey, we're
old, you know?

165
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,648
Yeah, I know,
Mrs. Salisbury.

166
00:10:20,682 --> 00:10:21,817
I'm sorry, too.

167
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,854
Merry Christmas.

168
00:10:58,352 --> 00:11:00,289
Hey, Willy!

169
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,062
If I thought you were
messing with my sister,

170
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:07,001
I'd wipe the
streets with you.

171
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,310
Ed, Willy's at the door.

172
00:11:47,344 --> 00:11:49,347
Can you let him in?

173
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:06,144
Alright,
come on in, Willy.

174
00:12:06,178 --> 00:12:07,313
Stop right there, son.

175
00:12:07,346 --> 00:12:09,283
Stop right there.

176
00:12:09,317 --> 00:12:10,787
Don't go running through
the house, Willy.

177
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,323
DeeDee.

178
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,225
Willy.

179
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,230
Stop right there, son.

180
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:21,173
Willy, you can't
touch DeeDee anymore.

181
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:23,075
But there's cookies.

182
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,047
Have a cookie, Willy.

183
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:30,289
It isn't right.

184
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,227
There's apples?

185
00:12:33,263 --> 00:12:36,168
Alright, have
an apple, Willy.

186
00:12:37,702 --> 00:12:41,042
Willy, did you understand
what I just said?

187
00:12:42,813 --> 00:12:45,049
Don't eat the core.

188
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,653
Willy...

189
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:52,163
-Not one.
-Just one.

190
00:12:52,197 --> 00:12:53,265
-Not one.
-Just one.

191
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:55,034
-Not one.
-Just one.

192
00:12:55,068 --> 00:12:56,103
Okay, alright.

193
00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:56,940
Cut it out.

194
00:12:56,972 --> 00:12:58,174
Alright, come on.

195
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,276
Let's go.
The van is waiting.

196
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:00,479
-Not one.
-Just one.

197
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:02,349
-Not one.
-Just one.

198
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:03,984
-Not one.
-Just one.

199
00:13:07,826 --> 00:13:08,760
-Not one.
-Just one.

200
00:13:08,796 --> 00:13:09,363
-Not one.
-Just one.

201
00:13:09,397 --> 00:13:11,033
-Not one.
-Just one.

202
00:13:11,067 --> 00:13:12,034
-Not one.
-Just one.

203
00:13:12,068 --> 00:13:13,303
-Not one.
-Just one.

204
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:14,236
-Not one.
-Just one.

205
00:13:14,272 --> 00:13:15,139
-Not one.
-Just one.

206
00:13:15,173 --> 00:13:16,308
-Not one.
-Just one.

207
00:13:16,342 --> 00:13:17,410
Come on. Come on.

208
00:13:17,445 --> 00:13:19,782
Okay, let's load up, folks.

209
00:13:19,816 --> 00:13:21,051
Not one.

210
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:30,132
Alright, Crum, no snacks
if that continues.

211
00:13:30,168 --> 00:13:31,804
Willy, come on.

212
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:32,739
-Not one.
-Just one.

213
00:13:32,774 --> 00:13:33,942
-Not one.
-Just one.

214
00:13:33,975 --> 00:13:36,346
-Not one.
-Just one.

215
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,085
Bye, mommy.

216
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,019
Bye, sweetie.

217
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,039
Bye!

218
00:14:13,984 --> 00:14:15,453
Just one.

219
00:14:20,395 --> 00:14:21,931
Just one.

220
00:14:21,965 --> 00:14:23,701
Not one.

221
00:14:35,957 --> 00:14:36,925
Alright, come on.

222
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,128
Everybody back to work.

223
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,197
Let's go, come on.

224
00:14:40,232 --> 00:14:41,533
What's going on in here?

225
00:14:52,087 --> 00:14:52,954
Hey!

226
00:14:52,989 --> 00:14:55,526
How's your brother doing?

227
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,461
Good.

228
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:57,196
Great.

229
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,264
Better.

230
00:14:58,298 --> 00:14:59,400
I never see him.

231
00:14:59,436 --> 00:15:01,104
He doesn't get out much.

232
00:15:01,138 --> 00:15:02,907
That's too bad.

233
00:15:02,941 --> 00:15:04,076
The hell of a ball player.

234
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,478
Absolutely.

235
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:07,014
He was the best.

236
00:15:07,048 --> 00:15:08,783
Should've gone pro.

237
00:15:08,818 --> 00:15:11,155
Went to Iraq instead.

238
00:15:11,957 --> 00:15:16,264
Well, can't play for the
Yankees, might as well go

239
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:18,201
play for Uncle Sam.

240
00:15:21,542 --> 00:15:24,447
How come you never played?

241
00:15:24,481 --> 00:15:26,216
I did.

242
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,121
Yeah!

243
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:38,540
What...

244
00:15:38,573 --> 00:15:40,375
What can I get you?

245
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,916
I'll have a
glass of red wine.

246
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:45,888
Red wine.

247
00:15:45,921 --> 00:15:47,323
And an application.

248
00:15:47,357 --> 00:15:48,926
I'm looking for a job.

249
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,964
Well, I wish I
could help you.

250
00:15:56,307 --> 00:15:57,910
What's your name, honey?

251
00:15:57,943 --> 00:15:59,111
Jessie.

252
00:15:59,145 --> 00:16:00,313
Why don't you
put your...

253
00:16:00,347 --> 00:16:01,950
your number down, Jessie?

254
00:16:01,984 --> 00:16:05,023
You know, if I hear of anything,
I'll let you know.

255
00:16:07,094 --> 00:16:08,997
Drink's on the house.

256
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,332
Hey, thanks.

257
00:16:16,344 --> 00:16:18,246
-She's new in town.
-Mhm.

258
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,183
She's got no wedding ring.

259
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:23,057
You want me to
introduce you?

260
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,091
No.

261
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,929
No, no, never
been good at that.

262
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:57,354
Thank you for calling
the Veteran Affairs

263
00:16:57,389 --> 00:16:59,224
claim assistance hotline.

264
00:16:59,256 --> 00:17:01,125
If you're calling to
request a copy of a

265
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,099
document relating to your
VA record, please submit

266
00:17:04,134 --> 00:17:08,174
the signed, written statement to
your local regional office.

267
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,343
If you would like to speak...

268
00:17:17,259 --> 00:17:18,493
Lift 'em.

269
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,936
Going to dance?

270
00:17:23,971 --> 00:17:25,307
Yeah, honey.

271
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,175
Going to Christmas dance?

272
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,581
Yes, I said yes.
Lift your arm.

273
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:34,456
Christmas dance at the
box factory, I'm going?

274
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,160
Yes, I said yes.

275
00:17:36,193 --> 00:17:38,596
You're going to the Christmas
dance at the box factory.

276
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:39,934
Lift this arm.

277
00:17:40,469 --> 00:17:42,270
I am, jerk.

278
00:17:43,941 --> 00:17:44,942
Willy, too?

279
00:17:44,977 --> 00:17:48,149
I don't know, honey.
Stop moving. Stop moving.

280
00:17:51,555 --> 00:17:53,525
I love him.

281
00:17:53,558 --> 00:17:57,634
Willy Crum, he's
the one I love.

282
00:17:58,568 --> 00:18:00,372
Keep... keep your arm up,
just another...

283
00:18:00,404 --> 00:18:02,206
I am. I hate you!

284
00:18:02,241 --> 00:18:04,479
There is no reason to
act this way, okay?

285
00:18:04,512 --> 00:18:06,180
No one is hurting you.

286
00:18:06,214 --> 00:18:08,018
Now stop playing
with the water.

287
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,088
I'm not, alright!

288
00:18:09,123 --> 00:18:11,393
DeeDee, I am warning you,
stop hitting the water!

289
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:14,262
You're like a jerk!

290
00:18:16,701 --> 00:18:19,406
I want Willy.

291
00:19:14,743 --> 00:19:17,314
License and registration, ma'am.

292
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,403
Get in bed and turn over.

293
00:19:59,461 --> 00:20:01,130
DeeDee.

294
00:20:02,164 --> 00:20:04,735
Did Willy Crum put his
fingers in you again?

295
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,539
No, sir.

296
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:09,813
Finger.

297
00:20:09,846 --> 00:20:10,882
DeeDee.

298
00:20:10,914 --> 00:20:15,087
If he does that, or if he
tries to do that again,

299
00:20:15,123 --> 00:20:17,594
don't let him and
tell Mr. Jenkins.

300
00:20:17,626 --> 00:20:18,628
I love him, you know.

301
00:20:18,663 --> 00:20:20,666
Jesus Christ.

302
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,636
John F. Kennedy.

303
00:20:22,671 --> 00:20:23,571
Not tonight.

304
00:20:23,605 --> 00:20:27,345
John F. Kennedy!

305
00:20:27,378 --> 00:20:29,348
Mowing Jesus' lawn.

306
00:20:29,383 --> 00:20:31,487
His brother, Bobby.

307
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:34,356
Mowing Jesus' lawn.

308
00:20:34,392 --> 00:20:35,293
Pope Paul.

309
00:20:35,327 --> 00:20:36,296
The lawn.

310
00:20:36,328 --> 00:20:37,096
Pope Pious.

311
00:20:37,131 --> 00:20:38,233
The lawn.

312
00:20:38,266 --> 00:20:39,267
Pope John.

313
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,368
The lawn.

314
00:20:40,403 --> 00:20:42,407
Pancake, the cat
the car smashed.

315
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:43,174
The lawn.

316
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,578
They're all mowing
Jesus' lawn.

317
00:20:45,613 --> 00:20:47,449
Jesus loves them.

318
00:20:47,482 --> 00:20:49,118
Yeah, honey.

319
00:20:49,153 --> 00:20:51,356
Cause they do the lawn.

320
00:20:51,391 --> 00:20:54,462
Yeah, let's get to sleep
before Jesus looks down

321
00:20:54,496 --> 00:20:57,200
for some new helpers.

322
00:20:57,234 --> 00:20:58,804
He won't, will he?

323
00:20:58,837 --> 00:21:01,607
Not if we move along.

324
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:27,255
Willy Crum, he
loves me you know.

325
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,394
I know.

326
00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:30,797
I know.

327
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:33,201
Everybody knows.

328
00:21:41,683 --> 00:21:44,923
They're sending a bunch of
weapons inspectors back to Iraq.

329
00:21:44,957 --> 00:21:46,626
I wish I was going.

330
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,264
Bet your butt I'd come
back with a good war story.

331
00:21:49,298 --> 00:21:50,700
There's no such thing.

332
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:52,169
What about dad's?

333
00:21:52,204 --> 00:21:53,572
We're enjoying
ourselves...

334
00:21:53,606 --> 00:21:55,475
I don't need to
hear that again.

335
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,312
Hear what again?

336
00:21:57,346 --> 00:21:59,384
We were just trying to
remember your war story.

337
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:00,519
Todd.

338
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:02,221
Nothing to remember.

339
00:22:02,256 --> 00:22:04,727
What are you
talking about?

340
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:06,663
We were enjoying
ourselves on the beach.

341
00:22:06,698 --> 00:22:09,169
Come on, dad.
You tell it.

342
00:22:09,201 --> 00:22:11,138
No.

343
00:22:11,173 --> 00:22:13,542
We'd only been in
country a few weeks.

344
00:22:13,576 --> 00:22:16,315
We hadn't seen
any action yet.

345
00:22:23,829 --> 00:22:28,303
I'm taking the entry exam for
the police force next week.

346
00:22:28,337 --> 00:22:29,539
Again?

347
00:22:29,573 --> 00:22:32,277
I'm gonna ace
it this time.

348
00:22:34,715 --> 00:22:36,652
Did you get smarter or
did the test get dumber?

349
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,558
Todd, let your dad eat.

350
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:41,862
No, I gotta good feeling.

351
00:22:41,895 --> 00:22:44,835
I'm doing really
good on my patrols.

352
00:22:44,868 --> 00:22:46,737
The reserves.

353
00:22:46,771 --> 00:22:48,573
You gotta do the volunteer
stuff if you wanna get

354
00:22:48,608 --> 00:22:50,611
into the academy.

355
00:22:50,645 --> 00:22:52,382
I do all the same things.

356
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,985
I assist on arrests.

357
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:56,256
I carry a gun.

358
00:22:56,289 --> 00:22:57,826
No pay though.

359
00:22:57,858 --> 00:23:00,696
That day is not far off.

360
00:23:00,731 --> 00:23:03,302
The cops don't
want you, Todd.

361
00:23:03,336 --> 00:23:05,507
The military turned
you down, too.

362
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,442
You're just not that
kind of material.

363
00:23:07,477 --> 00:23:09,480
Face it.

364
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:18,798
I love you, ma.

365
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:20,634
-Love you, too.
-Yeah.

366
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:26,579
Real nice, Ed.

367
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,515
He's not being realistic.

368
00:23:31,722 --> 00:23:33,826
The situation
with Willy Crum,

369
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:36,764
we have tried
everything to stop it.

370
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:38,769
They're in love.

371
00:23:38,801 --> 00:23:40,771
Love to a...

372
00:23:40,806 --> 00:23:42,375
Retarded person.

373
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:43,979
It's still love.

374
00:23:44,011 --> 00:23:45,780
Mentally
challenged adults.

375
00:23:45,816 --> 00:23:48,887
When my daughter was
born, it was retarded.

376
00:23:48,921 --> 00:23:50,990
I'll stick with
that, thanks.

377
00:23:51,026 --> 00:23:54,432
My retarded daughter
has feelings.

378
00:23:54,464 --> 00:23:56,040
Of course.

379
00:23:56,075 --> 00:23:59,441
I don't trust you agreeing
with me so you can stop it.

380
00:24:16,905 --> 00:24:20,412
Every time an alarm
goes off, he goes off.

381
00:24:20,446 --> 00:24:21,681
He does it for DeeDee.

382
00:24:21,714 --> 00:24:25,621
He does it because he
can't help himself.

383
00:24:25,656 --> 00:24:28,028
You can't blame
DeeDee for that.

384
00:24:28,061 --> 00:24:30,698
You see how
disruptive it is.

385
00:24:30,732 --> 00:24:33,971
Yeah, not so good for
the box business?

386
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:35,007
What do you pay
these people?

387
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,976
Twenty bucks a week?

388
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,178
I resent that.

389
00:24:38,212 --> 00:24:40,684
Mrs. Kendall, we're providing
a community service here.

390
00:24:40,718 --> 00:24:44,692
Yeah, but you have to
allow for their behaviors.

391
00:24:51,503 --> 00:24:54,040
DeeDee placed this in a
box on its way down the

392
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:55,979
assembly line.

393
00:24:56,013 --> 00:24:58,050
For Willy.

394
00:25:01,423 --> 00:25:02,791
It's a used maxi pad.

395
00:25:02,826 --> 00:25:05,631
I can see that.

396
00:25:05,664 --> 00:25:09,270
It's a gift.

397
00:25:09,305 --> 00:25:12,277
It's how she shows
her feelings.

398
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:13,846
It's not sanitary.

399
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,551
Don't tell me that my
daughter isn't sanitary.

400
00:25:16,585 --> 00:25:17,920
I keep that girl clean.

401
00:25:17,953 --> 00:25:20,657
We're not saying you don't
take good care of DeeDee,

402
00:25:20,692 --> 00:25:21,461
Mrs. Kendall.

403
00:25:21,493 --> 00:25:23,496
What if I keep her
home a few days?

404
00:25:23,531 --> 00:25:25,868
Mrs. Kendall...

405
00:25:25,903 --> 00:25:30,644
DeeDee cannot come back
to the box factory.

406
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:34,785
This will explain
everything.

407
00:25:43,468 --> 00:25:44,870
Sweetheart,
we're just gonna go home.

408
00:25:44,904 --> 00:25:46,339
-No, I wanna go Willy.
-We're gonna go home.

409
00:25:46,374 --> 00:25:47,910
You didn't do
anything wrong, okay?

410
00:25:47,942 --> 00:25:50,381
-No.
-Come on, don't fight me, baby.

411
00:25:50,414 --> 00:25:51,951
I don't wanna go.

412
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:52,817
Willy!

413
00:25:52,853 --> 00:25:53,620
Please, please, don't
give me trouble.

414
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:54,153
-I wanna stay here, mommy.
-Okay?

415
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:55,555
No, no, no. I know!

416
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,825
I don't wanna go!

417
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:58,628
I wanna stay with Willy!

418
00:25:58,663 --> 00:26:00,465
Honey, stop.
Stop it.

419
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,403
-Mommy, no! I'm not gonna go!
-Calm down.

420
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:03,571
Honey.

421
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:04,538
-No!
-Stop.

422
00:26:04,574 --> 00:26:05,609
-No!
-Stop!

423
00:26:05,643 --> 00:26:07,613
-No.
-Stop it!

424
00:26:07,645 --> 00:26:09,315
Stop! Sweetheart, let go.

425
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:11,653
No!

426
00:26:11,688 --> 00:26:12,588
Stop!

427
00:26:13,923 --> 00:26:14,959
DeeDee, no!

428
00:26:14,993 --> 00:26:16,362
DeeDee!

429
00:26:18,467 --> 00:26:19,435
DeeDee!

430
00:26:23,942 --> 00:26:24,978
DeeDee!

431
00:26:25,713 --> 00:26:27,548
DeeDee!

432
00:27:37,213 --> 00:27:41,087
They used to bring them in
and hook 'em up for you.

433
00:27:45,461 --> 00:27:47,499
I'll take a
Jack and ginger.

434
00:27:57,183 --> 00:27:58,853
Hold the Jack.

435
00:28:00,723 --> 00:28:02,091
Good for you.

436
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:04,129
Good for me.

437
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,946
Nice to see your
face in here again.

438
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:13,846
You, too.

439
00:28:14,851 --> 00:28:16,553
Yeah.

440
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,095
Kent's stuff's over there.

441
00:28:29,811 --> 00:28:32,750
Your other boy comes
in here sometimes.

442
00:28:36,692 --> 00:28:38,627
I wouldn't know.

443
00:28:47,211 --> 00:28:48,980
There they are.

444
00:28:49,013 --> 00:28:52,052
Alright. There you go, Ray.

445
00:28:52,086 --> 00:28:55,491
Look at these two
peas, Mark, Jamie.

446
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:56,929
Alright.

447
00:29:02,972 --> 00:29:04,142
Can I come in?

448
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:08,550
Thanks, sorry.

449
00:29:23,778 --> 00:29:26,115
Does this bus go all
the way to Tottenville?

450
00:29:26,151 --> 00:29:29,556
No, that's
actually the 59.

451
00:29:29,588 --> 00:29:31,091
It's a much larger bus.

452
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:32,193
You know what, I
need to get off.

453
00:29:32,227 --> 00:29:32,961
I'm so sorry.

454
00:29:32,996 --> 00:29:33,663
No, no, no.

455
00:29:33,696 --> 00:29:34,529
Don't worry.

456
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:36,999
I'll take you.

457
00:29:37,538 --> 00:29:39,574
Are you sure?

458
00:29:39,607 --> 00:29:41,878
Happy to do it.

459
00:29:51,931 --> 00:29:53,567
You...

460
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,574
New in town?

461
00:29:57,607 --> 00:30:00,144
It's that obvious?

462
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:01,816
Well...

463
00:30:01,849 --> 00:30:05,187
I don't mean anything
by it, it's just

464
00:30:05,222 --> 00:30:09,096
it's kind of a
forgotten place.

465
00:30:09,131 --> 00:30:11,168
That's what I'm
looking for.

466
00:30:13,171 --> 00:30:14,972
What's your name?

467
00:30:15,007 --> 00:30:17,077
I'm Jessie.

468
00:30:18,847 --> 00:30:20,250
Hi...

469
00:30:20,284 --> 00:30:22,588
I'm...

470
00:30:22,622 --> 00:30:24,659
Shit!

471
00:30:29,401 --> 00:30:31,004
Un-fucking-believable.

472
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:31,870
No, no, no, I have this.

473
00:30:31,905 --> 00:30:33,707
-Get out of here, man.
-I have this.

474
00:30:33,742 --> 00:30:34,643
What is this?

475
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:35,646
-It's a silver star.
-It's a silver star?

476
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,714
What the fuck am I gonna
do with a silver star?

477
00:30:36,748 --> 00:30:37,950
No, it's silver. It's
gotta be worth something.

478
00:30:41,155 --> 00:30:42,157
What the fuck
are you doing?

479
00:30:42,192 --> 00:30:44,094
What the fuck
are you doing?

480
00:30:44,128 --> 00:30:45,363
That's your fucking
silver star.

481
00:30:45,397 --> 00:30:47,166
I don't care, it
doesn't mean anything!

482
00:30:47,201 --> 00:30:48,067
Get on the bus.

483
00:30:48,102 --> 00:30:49,204
No, stop it's my...

484
00:30:49,238 --> 00:30:51,307
No, no, no!

485
00:30:51,342 --> 00:30:52,978
I need something.

486
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,779
I need something.

487
00:30:54,815 --> 00:30:55,950
I know, I know, I know.

488
00:30:55,983 --> 00:30:56,884
Get on the bus.

489
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:58,153
Get on the bus.

490
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,971
Stay on the bus.

491
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,317
Ray, please no singing
right now, Ray.

492
00:31:13,349 --> 00:31:14,617
Please.

493
00:31:14,652 --> 00:31:16,020
I know, I know, I know.

494
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,225
Just get in the seat.

495
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:19,862
Just get in the seat.

496
00:31:19,895 --> 00:31:20,896
Just stay in the seat.

497
00:31:20,931 --> 00:31:23,701
Fine! Okay, okay, okay!

498
00:31:24,738 --> 00:31:26,240
Quiet!

499
00:31:26,273 --> 00:31:28,142
Fucking quiet!

500
00:31:34,957 --> 00:31:37,294
Can you let me off please?

501
00:31:52,155 --> 00:31:52,923
It's all alright.

502
00:31:52,957 --> 00:31:54,692
Everybody's alright.

503
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,689
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

504
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:14,296
I don't wanna go
in there and die!

505
00:32:14,329 --> 00:32:16,666
I don't wanna go in there!

506
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:19,673
Yeah.

507
00:32:20,842 --> 00:32:22,177
Alright.

508
00:32:22,211 --> 00:32:23,945
-Alright.
-Alright?

509
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,115
Come on.

510
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,320
What are you looking at?

511
00:32:27,354 --> 00:32:29,023
Go inside.

512
00:32:29,057 --> 00:32:31,227
-Okay, I know.
-Honey, come on.

513
00:32:32,329 --> 00:32:34,064
What are you looking at?

514
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:35,969
I'ma go inside.

515
00:32:39,442 --> 00:32:41,144
Okay.

516
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,789
No need to tell
your father.

517
00:33:04,825 --> 00:33:06,862
Great.

518
00:33:28,969 --> 00:33:31,306
Don't waste your
time reading that.

519
00:33:41,526 --> 00:33:45,031
We have to consider
institutionalizing her.

520
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,334
No.

521
00:33:46,367 --> 00:33:49,807
It's bad enough with Kent
pulling his act upstairs

522
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,508
all these years.

523
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:53,079
It's not an
act, he's sick.

524
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,985
He came back from
the war sick.

525
00:33:56,019 --> 00:33:57,522
How is it you don't
understand that?

526
00:33:57,556 --> 00:33:59,058
Okay.

527
00:34:00,994 --> 00:34:02,029
What is that?

528
00:34:02,064 --> 00:34:04,268
What was what?

529
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:16,990
She's in the
walls, I tell ya.

530
00:34:17,025 --> 00:34:19,963
She's tied to a bed
for Christ sakes.

531
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:25,307
Look, Elaine...

532
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:29,547
It's not just that she can't
go back to the box factory.

533
00:34:29,581 --> 00:34:31,985
It's the whole program.

534
00:34:32,019 --> 00:34:34,791
Medication is part
of that program.

535
00:34:34,826 --> 00:34:36,362
We can't afford
her medication.

536
00:34:36,394 --> 00:34:38,097
She's gonna go
off her meds.

537
00:34:38,132 --> 00:34:39,534
Don't you remember what
happened the last time?

538
00:34:39,568 --> 00:34:41,538
It took five of them
and a strait jacket.

539
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,306
Jesus, they had to shoot
her with a tranquilizer

540
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:46,312
gun like a damn animal!

541
00:34:46,347 --> 00:34:48,517
I'll find a way
to make it work.

542
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,120
I'll get her in
another program.

543
00:34:50,153 --> 00:34:53,960
She's been in three programs
in the last two years.

544
00:35:13,597 --> 00:35:15,901
Remember how much fun we
all used to have when the

545
00:35:15,934 --> 00:35:18,005
kids were little?

546
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:25,519
We'd eat dinner together for
Christmas, go to the dance.

547
00:35:25,552 --> 00:35:28,156
We were good dancers, Ed.

548
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,527
Everybody said.

549
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:35,170
And Kent was
everybody's favorite.

550
00:35:35,204 --> 00:35:38,911
Girls couldn't
get enough of him.

551
00:35:38,945 --> 00:35:44,086
They knew he was a caring
boy, a loving boy.

552
00:35:44,121 --> 00:35:45,489
In his Marine blues.

553
00:35:47,427 --> 00:35:49,229
They swooned.

554
00:35:49,262 --> 00:35:53,502
They fell like spent
flower petals at his feet.

555
00:35:56,043 --> 00:35:58,413
That was fun.

556
00:36:00,485 --> 00:36:04,191
Will we ever do
that again, Ed?

557
00:36:37,688 --> 00:36:40,092
Yeah, Kendall.

558
00:36:40,126 --> 00:36:42,429
K-E-N-D-A-L-L.

559
00:36:42,463 --> 00:36:44,567
The doctor knows me.

560
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:45,900
I don't care.

561
00:36:45,936 --> 00:36:49,409
My kid needs help.

562
00:36:49,443 --> 00:36:50,578
He has to talk to me.

563
00:36:50,612 --> 00:36:52,347
Go and get him.

564
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,415
Hold on, baby.

565
00:36:53,451 --> 00:36:55,219
Hold on. I can't...

566
00:36:55,253 --> 00:36:57,590
Doctor Mooney, it's
Elaine Kendall.

567
00:36:57,625 --> 00:36:59,161
Yeah, it's about Kent.

568
00:36:59,193 --> 00:37:00,663
He's run out of his meds.

569
00:37:01,798 --> 00:37:06,072
No, I know it's six days
until his next prescription.

570
00:37:06,106 --> 00:37:08,945
No, I don't care
about the law.

571
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:12,351
You have to help us!

572
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,659
Hello?

573
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,295
Hello?

574
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,500
Motherfucker!

575
00:37:22,103 --> 00:37:23,037
Alright, baby.

576
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,675
Come on, we're
gonna go out.

577
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:26,311
Come on.

578
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:27,413
Come on. Sit up.

579
00:37:27,447 --> 00:37:29,017
Come on, we're gonna go
someplace and get some meds.

580
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,621
Come on.

581
00:37:31,554 --> 00:37:33,290
Thank you.

582
00:37:46,248 --> 00:37:49,085
It's gonna be Christmas
this Saturday, DeeDee.

583
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,223
You know what that means?

584
00:37:51,259 --> 00:37:54,998
Willy Crum put
his finger in me.

585
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:58,369
You tell him not to.

586
00:37:58,403 --> 00:38:03,478
Big fish are gonna be
swimming in this tank soon.

587
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:05,550
That's Christmas.

588
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,057
That's the day
God's son was born.

589
00:38:10,092 --> 00:38:11,461
Fish?

590
00:38:11,496 --> 00:38:14,067
Fish, yeah.

591
00:38:15,568 --> 00:38:20,512
You know, DeeDee, enough
piranha can shred a full

592
00:38:20,545 --> 00:38:25,353
sized horse down to the
bone in under a minute.

593
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:26,422
Yup.

594
00:38:26,456 --> 00:38:29,260
And those horses that are
getting eaten up after a

595
00:38:29,295 --> 00:38:32,600
while they don't care
because they go into shock.

596
00:38:32,635 --> 00:38:35,005
Shock.

597
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:38,980
Shock is when you hurt so
bad that you don't feel

598
00:38:39,014 --> 00:38:41,518
anything anymore.

599
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:43,689
It's a gift from Jesus.

600
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:45,358
John F. Kennedy.

601
00:38:45,391 --> 00:38:46,693
Sug.

602
00:38:46,728 --> 00:38:48,496
Not now, honey, not...

603
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,233
John F. Kennedy.

604
00:38:50,266 --> 00:38:52,670
Okay.

605
00:38:52,704 --> 00:38:54,741
Mowing Jesus' lawn.

606
00:38:54,777 --> 00:38:56,479
Joe DiMaggio.

607
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,380
The lawn.

608
00:38:57,414 --> 00:39:00,052
Sid, the dog that
ate the rat poison.

609
00:39:00,085 --> 00:39:01,288
Doing the lawn, baby.

610
00:39:01,322 --> 00:39:03,224
They're all
doing the lawn.

611
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:06,163
Jesus loves them.

612
00:39:06,197 --> 00:39:11,239
Well, he tolerates
their money.

613
00:39:13,177 --> 00:39:15,414
Mommy's here.

614
00:39:19,755 --> 00:39:21,392
Okay.

615
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:23,094
Slow down.

616
00:39:23,128 --> 00:39:27,169
It's all okay now.

617
00:39:27,202 --> 00:39:28,070
Mommy's home.

618
00:39:28,105 --> 00:39:30,074
Mommy's here.

619
00:39:30,108 --> 00:39:31,476
Hey, kid.

620
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,313
Hey, pop.

621
00:39:34,451 --> 00:39:38,257
They gave him a shot of
Demerol at the hospital.

622
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:39,726
Great.

623
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,101
Yeah, that was the nicest
people in the whole world.

624
00:39:44,135 --> 00:39:46,272
We'll go back there.

625
00:39:46,306 --> 00:39:48,710
That was a keeper.

626
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,150
Gave me enough meds til
next week, then I'll get

627
00:39:53,184 --> 00:39:54,320
his refill.

628
00:39:54,353 --> 00:39:55,789
Even better.

629
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:01,097
Because I was still...
That I was sick.

630
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:03,235
You know?

631
00:40:03,271 --> 00:40:05,140
No fooling.

632
00:40:05,173 --> 00:40:06,409
They knew their business.

633
00:40:06,443 --> 00:40:07,244
They just...

634
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:10,150
Psychosomatics.

635
00:40:10,182 --> 00:40:11,451
Psycho psychotics.

636
00:40:11,485 --> 00:40:13,422
Psycho traumatic.

637
00:40:13,456 --> 00:40:15,759
Gobbley, whoop-di-do!

638
00:40:15,793 --> 00:40:19,132
Just to peel our shit,
right to the vein.

639
00:40:22,606 --> 00:40:23,674
You!

640
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:27,447
Okay, okay, take
it easy, Kent.

641
00:40:27,481 --> 00:40:28,617
Go easy.

642
00:40:28,652 --> 00:40:30,655
Woo!

643
00:40:30,688 --> 00:40:34,861
I forgot all these years.

644
00:40:34,894 --> 00:40:36,898
What?

645
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:42,142
Just how pretty
your eyes are.

646
00:40:43,344 --> 00:40:45,848
I knew it.

647
00:40:45,882 --> 00:40:47,217
You're married.

648
00:40:47,251 --> 00:40:49,556
All the good ones are.

649
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:53,329
I'm sure that he
does not deserve you.

650
00:40:57,806 --> 00:40:59,208
Okay.

651
00:40:59,842 --> 00:41:02,113
Okay, let's go, bud.

652
00:41:12,298 --> 00:41:14,737
Okay, kid, let's go.

653
00:41:14,769 --> 00:41:16,538
Upstairs.

654
00:41:20,447 --> 00:41:22,751
Look at that, daddy-o.

655
00:41:22,784 --> 00:41:25,322
Look at that.

656
00:41:27,327 --> 00:41:31,434
That was the Christmas
spirit in that hospital.

657
00:41:31,467 --> 00:41:32,335
Let's go upstairs.

658
00:41:32,369 --> 00:41:34,306
Okay.

659
00:41:42,922 --> 00:41:44,190
I'm going.

660
00:41:44,224 --> 00:41:45,861
-Alright.
-Okay.

661
00:41:48,666 --> 00:41:50,469
Tell me your war story.

662
00:41:50,503 --> 00:41:51,705
No, no, no.

663
00:41:51,739 --> 00:41:53,309
Not now.

664
00:41:54,711 --> 00:41:56,514
We were enjoying
ourselves.

665
00:41:56,548 --> 00:41:59,385
Yup, on the beach.

666
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,356
Okay.

667
00:42:01,925 --> 00:42:03,561
That's all now.

668
00:42:08,771 --> 00:42:10,341
Come on, champ.

669
00:42:11,409 --> 00:42:13,211
Let's call it a night.

670
00:42:17,653 --> 00:42:20,257
You must hate me.

671
00:42:20,291 --> 00:42:22,962
I don't hate you.

672
00:42:22,996 --> 00:42:26,669
You don't come
up here no more.

673
00:42:26,704 --> 00:42:30,778
I'm here now, Kent.

674
00:42:36,956 --> 00:42:39,194
But you don't no more.

675
00:42:51,284 --> 00:42:56,760
We were enjoying
ourselves on the beach,

676
00:42:56,793 --> 00:42:59,266
it was getting dark.

677
00:42:59,297 --> 00:43:02,335
We'd been in
country a few weeks.

678
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,608
But we hadn't seen
any action yet.

679
00:43:04,641 --> 00:43:07,579
We just finished building an air
strip so we were celebrating.

680
00:43:07,614 --> 00:43:12,222
Drinking beers, smoking,
goofing around, you know.

681
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:14,693
And hey, it was.

682
00:43:14,726 --> 00:43:20,269
And after a while, everybody
went back to the camp.

683
00:43:20,304 --> 00:43:22,807
Except you.

684
00:43:22,842 --> 00:43:24,711
Except me.

685
00:43:24,746 --> 00:43:26,883
I stayed down
on the beach.

686
00:43:26,916 --> 00:43:29,355
I wanted to look
at the stars.

687
00:43:29,387 --> 00:43:31,757
That's when I saw them.

688
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:33,996
They came out of the west.

689
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:37,469
Four Chinese minks.

690
00:43:37,503 --> 00:43:39,338
They came in tandem, two
by two, and they dropped a

691
00:43:39,373 --> 00:43:41,776
shit load of bombs on us.

692
00:43:41,811 --> 00:43:46,952
Resulting in heavy
shrapnel dispersal.

693
00:43:46,987 --> 00:43:48,624
That's right.

694
00:43:48,657 --> 00:43:51,563
Heavy shrapnel dispersal.

695
00:43:51,596 --> 00:43:52,963
See?

696
00:43:52,998 --> 00:43:55,302
You know the rest
of the story.

697
00:43:55,336 --> 00:43:56,204
No, come on.

698
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:58,342
Come on, there were
bombs everywhere.

699
00:44:00,445 --> 00:44:04,352
The bombs were everywhere.

700
00:44:04,387 --> 00:44:12,368
And I ran back to the camp
and they were all dead.

701
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,471
All of them.

702
00:44:14,505 --> 00:44:16,541
Dead in their hammocks.

703
00:44:21,452 --> 00:44:24,590
Shredded.

704
00:44:24,623 --> 00:44:26,493
They were wrapped in them.

705
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:39,885
Wrapped in their blood-drenched,
charred hammocks

706
00:44:39,918 --> 00:44:42,723
like sausages in
their casings.

707
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:57,684
I was the only
one left alive.

708
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:00,992
I was the only
one left alive.

709
00:45:02,393 --> 00:45:06,667
I wonder why you never
got a medal for that.

710
00:45:40,699 --> 00:45:42,368
Fuck!

711
00:45:52,086 --> 00:45:53,590
Here you go.

712
00:45:55,594 --> 00:45:57,965
You ever seen one
of these before?

713
00:45:57,998 --> 00:45:59,166
Yeah, sure.

714
00:45:59,201 --> 00:46:02,039
That's a silver star.

715
00:46:03,507 --> 00:46:05,811
They give it to
you for bravery.

716
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,885
And they forget
all about you.

717
00:46:17,768 --> 00:46:19,338
How you doing?

718
00:46:23,445 --> 00:46:24,514
Todd!

719
00:46:25,014 --> 00:46:25,615
No, no, no!

720
00:46:25,648 --> 00:46:26,784
I didn't do anything, man!

721
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:27,819
I'm not gonna hit you.

722
00:46:27,853 --> 00:46:30,024
I just wanna talk.

723
00:46:33,931 --> 00:46:35,501
You holding?

724
00:46:35,534 --> 00:46:36,569
Alright.

725
00:46:36,603 --> 00:46:37,638
Yeah.

726
00:46:42,849 --> 00:46:43,783
Just take all of it.

727
00:46:43,817 --> 00:46:45,387
Yeah, man.

728
00:46:50,795 --> 00:46:52,498
Merry Christmas.

729
00:46:52,532 --> 00:46:54,402
Alright.

730
00:47:08,996 --> 00:47:11,434
You may visit on the
weekends, but we do ask

731
00:47:11,467 --> 00:47:14,038
for twenty-four
hours notice.

732
00:47:14,072 --> 00:47:16,476
What if we wanna bring her
home for a couple of days?

733
00:47:16,512 --> 00:47:18,515
Well, not in the
first six months.

734
00:47:18,547 --> 00:47:22,020
Routine is very
important, Mr. Kendall.

735
00:47:26,027 --> 00:47:29,134
They have to get used to
the idea that this is now

736
00:47:29,168 --> 00:47:30,971
their home.

737
00:47:31,005 --> 00:47:33,476
What about at night?
Where do they sleep?

738
00:47:33,509 --> 00:47:36,914
Most sleep two,
three to a room.

739
00:47:37,851 --> 00:47:40,555
They get used to it.

740
00:48:11,746 --> 00:48:13,683
I dropped my picture.

741
00:48:13,717 --> 00:48:15,987
I'm not supposed
to leave the car.

742
00:48:16,021 --> 00:48:17,625
Aw!

743
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,831
Sure, I'll get it for you.

744
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,509
Here you go.

745
00:48:28,878 --> 00:48:30,982
I'm not finished yet.

746
00:48:32,853 --> 00:48:34,822
Do you like rabbits?

747
00:48:34,856 --> 00:48:36,860
Sure, I do.

748
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,236
You can have this one.

749
00:48:42,271 --> 00:48:43,940
Wow.

750
00:48:43,974 --> 00:48:45,876
Are you all by
yourself our here?

751
00:48:45,911 --> 00:48:47,146
Yeah.

752
00:48:47,179 --> 00:48:48,047
You are?

753
00:48:48,081 --> 00:48:49,551
Hey, excuse me.

754
00:48:49,585 --> 00:48:50,552
Can I help you?

755
00:48:50,586 --> 00:48:53,090
Yeah, I was trying to
help the little girl.

756
00:48:53,123 --> 00:48:56,496
He asked me if
I was by myself.

757
00:48:57,199 --> 00:48:57,900
Come on, Annie.

758
00:48:57,932 --> 00:48:59,601
Let's go.

759
00:48:59,637 --> 00:49:00,905
Come on. You're coming
with me, let's go.

760
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,006
Wait, this is a
misunderstanding.

761
00:49:02,041 --> 00:49:02,975
Okay.

762
00:49:03,978 --> 00:49:06,248
I'll send someone else
out to take your order.

763
00:49:06,282 --> 00:49:09,019
Come on. Watch your step.

764
00:49:09,054 --> 00:49:11,459
I said, don't talk to
strangers, right?

765
00:49:51,166 --> 00:49:52,636
Hey.

766
00:49:56,943 --> 00:49:58,146
Hey.

767
00:50:05,693 --> 00:50:07,062
Todd.

768
00:50:08,197 --> 00:50:10,601
I got you something.

769
00:50:23,693 --> 00:50:26,732
Are those oxy's?

770
00:50:29,103 --> 00:50:29,971
Thank you, Todd.

771
00:50:30,003 --> 00:50:31,172
Thank you.

772
00:50:31,206 --> 00:50:33,679
Just don't pull that shit
like you did on my bus again.

773
00:50:33,711 --> 00:50:34,646
Mhm.

774
00:50:34,681 --> 00:50:38,153
I don't want people
seeing you act that way.

775
00:50:38,186 --> 00:50:40,190
I'm sorry.

776
00:50:41,427 --> 00:50:45,266
I get so cramped up here.

777
00:50:52,179 --> 00:50:57,422
I get so fucking
swallowed up here.

778
00:50:58,958 --> 00:51:02,164
Then I run out of meds.

779
00:51:02,197 --> 00:51:04,934
I get suffocated.

780
00:51:05,739 --> 00:51:07,173
Go easy on those.

781
00:51:07,208 --> 00:51:09,744
Alright, they gotta last
you to your next refill?

782
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,161
Who's your decorator, bro?

783
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:31,853
How come you never
hear nothing on all

784
00:51:31,887 --> 00:51:34,792
these claims you got
against the Marines?

785
00:51:34,826 --> 00:51:39,065
Because they got an
answer for every problem.

786
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:44,742
The rash, your problem.

787
00:51:44,777 --> 00:51:47,448
The long's your problem.

788
00:51:47,483 --> 00:51:52,325
No, it can't be linked to
anything specific.

789
00:51:52,358 --> 00:51:57,432
Yeah, no, no, it's not the
inoculations for anthrax

790
00:51:57,467 --> 00:52:00,038
and the others.

791
00:52:00,072 --> 00:52:04,814
No, it's not the
radioactive shells.

792
00:52:05,884 --> 00:52:09,925
That wouldn't cause the pain
that you're describing.

793
00:52:09,958 --> 00:52:15,066
We recommend psychiatric
counseling.

794
00:52:16,436 --> 00:52:17,838
It's standard.

795
00:52:17,873 --> 00:52:19,809
It's standard.

796
00:52:20,378 --> 00:52:23,317
Don't worry, here's
another form.

797
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:28,025
Yeah, but I hear some people
get their claims approved.

798
00:52:33,969 --> 00:52:40,849
They wear you out
and hope you die.

799
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:44,322
They're gonna
win this one.

800
00:52:45,456 --> 00:52:47,493
Don't say that shit, man.

801
00:52:47,527 --> 00:52:49,429
I hate when you do that.

802
00:52:49,465 --> 00:52:56,044
You're lucky I don't have
something more contagious.

803
00:52:56,077 --> 00:53:02,088
Some guys, they come back
so radioactive that they

804
00:53:02,121 --> 00:53:06,463
affect their
entire family.

805
00:53:09,501 --> 00:53:13,476
Glory to the pats.
Some war memorabilia.

806
00:53:16,983 --> 00:53:18,785
Give me that.

807
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:19,788
Give me it.

808
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:20,990
What is this?

809
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:22,125
It's just a picture.
Give it to me.

810
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:23,927
No kidding.

811
00:53:23,963 --> 00:53:25,398
What are you
doing with it?

812
00:53:25,431 --> 00:53:26,399
Give it to me.

813
00:53:26,434 --> 00:53:28,071
Okay.

814
00:53:38,255 --> 00:53:42,229
We, were following the
action after we liberated

815
00:53:42,264 --> 00:53:43,867
Kuwait.

816
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:47,306
Just a young guy
looking to live.

817
00:53:47,338 --> 00:53:49,041
You must have helped
him out a lot.

818
00:53:49,076 --> 00:53:50,545
Yeah.

819
00:53:50,577 --> 00:53:52,380
We all helped him.

820
00:53:54,085 --> 00:53:56,990
We killed his
family by mistake.

821
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,363
However it happened,
they died.

822
00:54:00,396 --> 00:54:01,398
I know.

823
00:54:01,432 --> 00:54:03,135
I get it.

824
00:54:04,137 --> 00:54:05,740
Get some rest.

825
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,746
I woke up...

826
00:54:15,356 --> 00:54:20,867
I woke up and I did
know what was happening.

827
00:54:28,548 --> 00:54:30,920
I did know.

828
00:54:32,123 --> 00:54:35,061
He was on top of me.

829
00:54:35,094 --> 00:54:36,863
What are you
talking about?

830
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:39,269
His mouth...

831
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:44,813
on my cock.

832
00:54:47,016 --> 00:54:50,355
I really didn't
have to do anything.

833
00:54:50,389 --> 00:54:52,926
So I just went with it.

834
00:54:52,961 --> 00:54:54,431
Go to sleep, Kent.

835
00:54:54,465 --> 00:54:56,300
Stop talking
and go to sleep.

836
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:58,338
I just needed you
to know something.

837
00:54:59,072 --> 00:55:00,541
Go to fucking sleep, Kent.

838
00:55:00,576 --> 00:55:02,545
My company command
that walked in...

839
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:04,115
Go to fucking sleep, Kent!

840
00:55:04,148 --> 00:55:05,317
They did it!

841
00:55:05,351 --> 00:55:09,157
They drove me out of the Marines
for that night with Izzy.

842
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:18,040
No, no, no!

843
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:21,314
No, because
it's a mistake.

844
00:55:21,347 --> 00:55:24,487
My job, the bus, the
reserves, if they ever

845
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:27,292
find out I got some fucking
loser junkie for a brother.

846
00:55:27,326 --> 00:55:30,231
No, I need 'em
for the pain, man!

847
00:55:30,264 --> 00:55:32,402
I just need 'em
for the pain!

848
00:55:36,911 --> 00:55:39,447
It's for the pain, Todd!

849
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,002
Alright.

850
00:56:10,673 --> 00:56:12,876
Dee, take these cigarettes
up and put 'em on Kent's

851
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:13,479
night table.

852
00:56:13,512 --> 00:56:14,446
No.

853
00:56:14,481 --> 00:56:16,517
He'll be looking for
'em when he wakes up.

854
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:18,086
Then get ready for bed.

855
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:19,188
No.

856
00:56:19,222 --> 00:56:20,391
Don't give me any guff.

857
00:56:42,431 --> 00:56:44,368
What'd you do to your thumb?

858
00:56:45,472 --> 00:56:47,609
It's nothing.

859
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:56,525
I went to Sunrise,
Staten Island today.

860
00:56:56,557 --> 00:56:58,260
Had a look around.

861
00:56:58,295 --> 00:57:00,197
Without telling me?

862
00:57:00,233 --> 00:57:03,205
There's a chance they
might take DeeDee.

863
00:57:03,237 --> 00:57:04,605
You went there
without telling me?

864
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:07,077
They got a really nice
bed there for her, honey.

865
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:10,116
Sunrise is no
place for DeeDee.

866
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:13,556
The people there are
much worse than DeeDee.

867
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:15,228
She's better off
dead than there.

868
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:16,561
So what do you wanna do?

869
00:57:16,596 --> 00:57:20,034
You wanna keep her here
with us and then she flips

870
00:57:20,068 --> 00:57:23,041
out and the cops come and
then health and human

871
00:57:23,074 --> 00:57:25,378
services come and they
haul her off to some

872
00:57:25,411 --> 00:57:28,617
dumping ground that's
worse than Sunrise.

873
00:57:28,652 --> 00:57:31,590
Atleast Sunrise is clean.

874
00:57:33,626 --> 00:57:35,963
You should've told me
about Sunrise, Ed.

875
00:57:37,702 --> 00:57:40,106
You should've told me that!

876
00:57:40,139 --> 00:57:41,942
I'm coming up DeeDee.

877
00:57:47,487 --> 00:57:49,456
Okay, DeeDee, sleep.

878
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:51,693
I am, jerk.

879
00:57:51,728 --> 00:57:54,032
I hate you.

880
00:57:54,065 --> 00:57:55,400
I know, baby.

881
00:57:55,434 --> 00:57:57,170
Think you're big.

882
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:00,476
Yup.

883
00:58:00,512 --> 00:58:02,015
Settle down now.

884
00:58:10,329 --> 00:58:11,998
Mommy, out. I don't wanna!

885
00:58:12,032 --> 00:58:13,268
Jesus Christ.

886
00:58:13,302 --> 00:58:15,606
Jesus Christ.

887
00:58:15,639 --> 00:58:17,575
John F. Kennedy.

888
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:19,378
Mowing Jesus' lawn.

889
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:20,748
His brother, Bobby.

890
00:58:20,782 --> 00:58:22,651
Mowing Jesus' lawn.

891
00:58:22,686 --> 00:58:24,322
The parakeet I ate.

892
00:58:24,356 --> 00:58:25,324
By mistake.

893
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:26,527
Yeah.

894
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:28,529
Mowing Jesus' lawn.

895
00:58:28,563 --> 00:58:29,531
The pope.

896
00:58:29,565 --> 00:58:30,331
The lawn.

897
00:58:30,367 --> 00:58:31,669
The other pope.

898
00:58:31,702 --> 00:58:34,007
That big lawn, baby.

899
00:58:34,041 --> 00:58:36,345
Kent's in his bedroom.

900
00:58:43,123 --> 00:58:44,626
What did you say?

901
00:58:44,659 --> 00:58:46,428
Kent's in bed.

902
00:58:46,463 --> 00:58:50,571
He's mowing Jesus' lawn.

903
00:59:45,672 --> 00:59:47,475
I'd like to do it.

904
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,405
Just a little longer.

905
01:02:57,597 --> 01:02:59,634
Why didn't they
shoot for Kent?

906
01:03:00,871 --> 01:03:03,275
They're not gonna
do that, Elaine.

907
01:03:04,510 --> 01:03:06,614
Why not?

908
01:03:06,648 --> 01:03:08,818
He was...

909
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:10,821
He didn't qualify.

910
01:03:10,856 --> 01:03:12,692
He's a veteran.

911
01:03:12,724 --> 01:03:15,797
He fought for his country.

912
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,535
They owe him that!

913
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:19,573
-Mom, don't...
-Elaine.

914
01:03:27,652 --> 01:03:29,421
Elaine.

915
01:03:29,456 --> 01:03:29,958
Elaine.

916
01:03:29,992 --> 01:03:30,993
Stop it.
Stop it.

917
01:03:31,025 --> 01:03:31,993
-Let go of me.
-We have to stop.

918
01:03:32,028 --> 01:03:33,465
-Let go of me.
-Elaine!

919
01:03:33,498 --> 01:03:34,466
Stop!

920
01:03:34,501 --> 01:03:35,903
Stop!

921
01:03:39,878 --> 01:03:43,918
I want you to go over there
and shoot for my son.

922
01:03:43,951 --> 01:03:45,653
He's a veteran.

923
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:47,090
He's just like you.

924
01:03:47,123 --> 01:03:48,023
He's a marine.

925
01:03:48,059 --> 01:03:50,329
If you knew my son,
you'd shoot for him.

926
01:03:50,364 --> 01:03:51,365
Please, sir, your wife.

927
01:03:51,398 --> 01:03:52,634
Please?
Please?

928
01:03:52,666 --> 01:03:53,601
Please.

929
01:03:53,635 --> 01:03:54,436
Please?

930
01:03:54,471 --> 01:03:55,038
Please?

931
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:55,938
Bastard.

932
01:03:55,972 --> 01:03:57,675
Heartless bastard.

933
01:03:58,945 --> 01:04:00,680
Look what you're doing.

934
01:04:07,829 --> 01:04:10,835
Get DeeDee and go home.

935
01:04:11,603 --> 01:04:12,938
Okay.

936
01:04:13,873 --> 01:04:15,675
Listen to your mother.

937
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:26,998
Ma'am.

938
01:04:28,132 --> 01:04:29,233
Ma'am.

939
01:04:31,606 --> 01:04:34,545
I'll shoot off a few rounds
for your boy if you want.

940
01:04:34,577 --> 01:04:35,980
Yeah?

941
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,355
Thanks.

942
01:04:41,123 --> 01:04:42,324
Could you shoot seven?

943
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,831
Heck, ma'am, I'll shoot all
twenty-one if you can stand it.

944
01:04:44,864 --> 01:04:46,935
I can stand it.

945
01:07:40,893 --> 01:07:43,030
What are you doing?

946
01:07:53,182 --> 01:07:56,755
I'm gonna go to bed now.

947
01:08:02,634 --> 01:08:04,936
Ed, you can sleep in
the bedroom any...

948
01:08:04,969 --> 01:08:07,106
anytime you want.

949
01:08:07,141 --> 01:08:11,549
I, I'm in no
shape for that.

950
01:08:11,583 --> 01:08:13,119
Snoring and everything, I...

951
01:08:13,152 --> 01:08:14,788
I don't mind.
Not so much.

952
01:08:14,822 --> 01:08:16,993
I know. I don't
think I-I can.

953
01:08:17,027 --> 01:08:19,197
Maybe just tonight.

954
01:08:23,238 --> 01:08:26,176
I can't, honey.

955
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:49,886
What am I gonna do now?

956
01:09:16,136 --> 01:09:18,038
I'm gonna make
you some tea.

957
01:09:21,614 --> 01:09:23,550
Jesus Christ.

958
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,786
Willy.

959
01:09:24,819 --> 01:09:26,087
My god, DeeDee!

960
01:09:26,122 --> 01:09:27,557
Dee!

961
01:09:28,793 --> 01:09:29,827
DeeDee!

962
01:09:29,863 --> 01:09:30,664
Willy!

963
01:09:30,697 --> 01:09:31,798
Hold up! Hold up!

964
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:44,621
Willy!

965
01:09:44,657 --> 01:09:45,891
Willy!

966
01:09:45,926 --> 01:09:47,227
Willy!

967
01:09:47,261 --> 01:09:49,331
Willy!

968
01:09:49,364 --> 01:09:50,967
Willy!

969
01:09:51,002 --> 01:09:52,271
Willy!

970
01:09:52,304 --> 01:09:54,641
Willy.

971
01:09:54,675 --> 01:09:56,912
Willy.

972
01:09:56,947 --> 01:09:58,081
Willy.

973
01:09:58,113 --> 01:10:00,284
Willy.

974
01:10:05,695 --> 01:10:06,697
Okay?

975
01:10:06,730 --> 01:10:08,132
Yeah.

976
01:10:16,314 --> 01:10:17,784
She'll be alright.

977
01:10:20,957 --> 01:10:22,193
Sh!

978
01:10:23,395 --> 01:10:25,699
Did you hear that?

979
01:10:25,734 --> 01:10:27,203
Hear what?

980
01:10:27,235 --> 01:10:29,104
I didn't hear anything.

981
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:31,177
There it is again.

982
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:34,382
I heard it.

983
01:10:34,416 --> 01:10:35,818
Me too.

984
01:10:35,853 --> 01:10:37,922
Sh! Sh! Sh!

985
01:10:47,975 --> 01:10:49,176
What the fuck?

986
01:10:49,208 --> 01:10:50,778
No, don't, don't.

987
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:51,780
I knew it.

988
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:53,351
Just one.

989
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:56,221
-Willy.
-Just one.

990
01:10:56,256 --> 01:11:00,264
Get out of the wall and come
into the house the right way.

991
01:11:02,903 --> 01:11:07,244
I am not letting that
maniac into this house.

992
01:11:08,012 --> 01:11:09,180
DeeDee here?

993
01:11:09,213 --> 01:11:11,016
DeeDee coming?

994
01:11:13,789 --> 01:11:16,094
I need to talk to you.

995
01:11:17,831 --> 01:11:20,068
Keep an eye on him.

996
01:11:20,101 --> 01:11:21,970
I got him.

997
01:11:25,043 --> 01:11:28,215
Have you seen enough?

998
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:31,054
Did this do it for you?

999
01:11:31,087 --> 01:11:35,260
This is why we have to
put her away, Elaine.

1000
01:11:35,296 --> 01:11:37,432
Yeah, sure, right.

1001
01:11:37,466 --> 01:11:39,871
Put 'em all away.

1002
01:11:39,904 --> 01:11:44,077
Put every little different
thing out of sight.

1003
01:11:44,113 --> 01:11:47,019
Like you did
with your son.

1004
01:11:49,488 --> 01:11:51,391
I'm going out.

1005
01:11:56,868 --> 01:11:58,805
He was dying up there, Ed.

1006
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:01,344
The least you could've
done was watch.

1007
01:12:06,421 --> 01:12:08,792
I watched.

1008
01:12:10,161 --> 01:12:12,265
How could you miss it?

1009
01:12:14,069 --> 01:12:16,073
Any of it?

1010
01:12:41,219 --> 01:12:42,954
What are you gonna do?

1011
01:12:44,391 --> 01:12:47,229
I really wish
you'd said we.

1012
01:12:48,498 --> 01:12:51,904
What are we gonna do?

1013
01:12:54,109 --> 01:12:57,314
Go get, DeeDee, would you?

1014
01:12:57,349 --> 01:12:59,953
I gotta take Willy back to
the assisted living center

1015
01:12:59,987 --> 01:13:02,458
and he won't come with
me without your sister.

1016
01:13:02,492 --> 01:13:03,961
Want me to come?

1017
01:13:03,993 --> 01:13:06,364
No.

1018
01:13:06,399 --> 01:13:09,938
Make sure your
father gets home.

1019
01:13:09,972 --> 01:13:11,943
I will.

1020
01:13:34,085 --> 01:13:36,956
Nobody should ever
lose their boy.

1021
01:13:52,585 --> 01:13:53,953
Merry Christmas, guys.

1022
01:13:53,988 --> 01:13:56,492
How's it going tonight?

1023
01:13:58,896 --> 01:14:02,168
Willy, what do you want?

1024
01:14:02,203 --> 01:14:03,905
Hamburger? Hotdog?

1025
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:05,976
Yes.

1026
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:07,811
We'll have...

1027
01:14:12,021 --> 01:14:13,356
Just give him a minute.

1028
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:14,458
Okay.

1029
01:14:14,493 --> 01:14:16,296
Willy.

1030
01:14:16,329 --> 01:14:17,966
Willy, honey.

1031
01:14:17,998 --> 01:14:18,898
Willy.

1032
01:14:18,934 --> 01:14:20,802
That's just his thing.

1033
01:14:22,106 --> 01:14:24,978
You like to dance?

1034
01:14:26,114 --> 01:14:27,884
Me too.

1035
01:14:27,917 --> 01:14:32,425
Hey, speaking of which we
are supposed to give these out.

1036
01:14:40,073 --> 01:14:42,210
Willy won't make
it this year.

1037
01:14:46,051 --> 01:14:47,219
I wish I could
sleep like that.

1038
01:14:48,122 --> 01:14:49,490
Yeah.

1039
01:14:49,524 --> 01:14:52,328
So we'll have...

1040
01:14:52,363 --> 01:14:55,402
Two hamburgers,
two hot dogs...

1041
01:14:55,435 --> 01:14:59,909
A large fry, a coke,
and a coffee for me.

1042
01:14:59,944 --> 01:15:00,612
Thanks.

1043
01:15:00,645 --> 01:15:01,746
Coffee.

1044
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:03,615
Great, I will put that in
and I can come right back

1045
01:15:03,650 --> 01:15:05,587
with the coffee.

1046
01:15:47,032 --> 01:15:49,537
I've never seen
you run before.

1047
01:16:26,439 --> 01:16:29,077
Hell of a day?

1048
01:16:32,617 --> 01:16:34,153
Willy.

1049
01:16:37,192 --> 01:16:38,694
Willy.

1050
01:16:41,766 --> 01:16:47,978
DeeDee needs
love and care.

1051
01:16:48,012 --> 01:16:49,014
Do you understand?

1052
01:16:50,315 --> 01:16:51,182
Just one.

1053
01:16:51,217 --> 01:16:52,085
No, no, no, honey!

1054
01:16:52,119 --> 01:16:53,154
Honey.

1055
01:16:53,188 --> 01:16:54,724
Let her sleep.

1056
01:16:58,230 --> 01:17:02,237
Because I'm thinking of letting
you spend more time with her.

1057
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:03,405
DeeDee?

1058
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:04,710
Yeah.

1059
01:17:04,743 --> 01:17:06,980
DeeDee.

1060
01:17:08,350 --> 01:17:12,358
Remember the night
he got that trophy?

1061
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:14,594
Yeah.

1062
01:17:14,627 --> 01:17:18,100
Empire State awards.

1063
01:17:18,135 --> 01:17:20,704
Every scout from
the east was there.

1064
01:17:20,739 --> 01:17:23,711
Joe DiMaggio stopped
by our table.

1065
01:17:23,744 --> 01:17:26,983
He said Kent had the best
swing on him that he'd

1066
01:17:27,018 --> 01:17:30,189
seen in any kid from New
York in twenty years.

1067
01:17:30,224 --> 01:17:33,163
He meant it, too.

1068
01:17:33,197 --> 01:17:35,701
Joltin' Joe DiMaggio.

1069
01:17:35,734 --> 01:17:38,472
The Yankee clipper.

1070
01:17:41,445 --> 01:17:45,085
They'll never be
another Joe DiMaggio.

1071
01:17:56,439 --> 01:18:02,116
If we let you be
around DeeDee,

1072
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:08,594
you have to believe
in her special-ness.

1073
01:18:10,030 --> 01:18:12,168
You understand?

1074
01:18:14,104 --> 01:18:19,748
Part of that is having
respect for DeeDee.

1075
01:18:21,219 --> 01:18:26,494
And that means not putting
your fingers in her.

1076
01:18:27,198 --> 01:18:29,402
You understand?

1077
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:39,385
But you have to
have respect.

1078
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:40,521
Respect.

1079
01:18:40,555 --> 01:18:42,792
Respect, Willy, yeah.

1080
01:18:44,261 --> 01:18:48,737
You have to respect
for anything to work.

1081
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:50,071
DeeDee.

1082
01:18:50,105 --> 01:18:51,474
Yeah.

1083
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:55,282
Yeah.

1084
01:18:55,317 --> 01:18:57,219
DeeDee.

1085
01:19:05,668 --> 01:19:07,438
I think I may
have killed him.

1086
01:19:07,471 --> 01:19:09,340
What?

1087
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,349
I gave him some pills.

1088
01:19:17,189 --> 01:19:20,161
I didn't know he got
booted up at the hospital

1089
01:19:20,195 --> 01:19:21,163
and I gave him some oxy.

1090
01:19:21,198 --> 01:19:23,135
A lot of it.

1091
01:19:24,436 --> 01:19:26,640
Jesus Christ.

1092
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:31,448
I said some awful
things to him.

1093
01:19:32,386 --> 01:19:34,322
I got in an argument and I
said some not nice stuff

1094
01:19:34,354 --> 01:19:35,623
that I shouldn't.

1095
01:19:35,658 --> 01:19:38,262
You didn't kill him, Todd.

1096
01:19:40,132 --> 01:19:43,438
He took care of
that on his own.

1097
01:19:48,882 --> 01:19:52,588
You know what happened
with Kent in the Marines?

1098
01:19:54,158 --> 01:19:55,826
He got injured.

1099
01:19:55,862 --> 01:19:57,530
Yeah, but...

1100
01:19:57,564 --> 01:19:59,266
He got sick.

1101
01:19:59,301 --> 01:20:01,438
Something got him sick.

1102
01:20:01,471 --> 01:20:04,576
The VA they're not
telling me anything.

1103
01:20:04,612 --> 01:20:05,479
Tell you what?

1104
01:20:05,512 --> 01:20:08,283
Why he didn't get a
military funeral.

1105
01:20:08,319 --> 01:20:09,186
It don't make sense.

1106
01:20:09,220 --> 01:20:10,723
Everybody gets one.

1107
01:20:12,193 --> 01:20:13,594
Let it go, dad.

1108
01:20:13,628 --> 01:20:15,231
Todd.

1109
01:20:15,265 --> 01:20:19,774
If you know anything,
please tell me.

1110
01:20:23,213 --> 01:20:24,448
He got kicked
out of the core.

1111
01:20:24,481 --> 01:20:26,317
For what?

1112
01:20:26,351 --> 01:20:27,753
I don't know.

1113
01:20:27,787 --> 01:20:29,757
Well how do you know
he got drummed out?

1114
01:20:29,792 --> 01:20:31,328
Because he told me.

1115
01:20:31,362 --> 01:20:33,699
Told you what?

1116
01:20:35,636 --> 01:20:38,207
That he got dishonorably
discharged.

1117
01:20:39,243 --> 01:20:41,547
Damn liar!

1118
01:20:43,283 --> 01:20:45,387
He's a decorated veteran.

1119
01:20:46,323 --> 01:20:46,824
Okay.

1120
01:20:46,856 --> 01:20:48,626
A bona fide hero.

1121
01:20:48,659 --> 01:20:50,796
You can stop being
jealous of him.

1122
01:20:50,832 --> 01:20:52,501
He's dead!

1123
01:20:53,336 --> 01:20:54,739
Stop, dad.

1124
01:20:55,974 --> 01:20:56,908
Stop.

1125
01:20:56,943 --> 01:20:57,978
Just stop.

1126
01:21:07,695 --> 01:21:11,737
You knew nothing
about, Kent.

1127
01:21:11,770 --> 01:21:15,410
You didn't know a god
damn thing about him.

1128
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:19,752
You and your
fucking war stories.

1129
01:21:19,784 --> 01:21:22,622
You put that
shit in his head.

1130
01:21:26,332 --> 01:21:30,605
You wanna know why your son
got kicked out of the core?

1131
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:32,373
You wanna know?

1132
01:21:32,408 --> 01:21:34,311
Answer me!

1133
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:37,583
You don't wanna know.

1134
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,556
You don't.

1135
01:21:44,297 --> 01:21:47,703
I never got a medal for
the Denang air raid.

1136
01:21:48,907 --> 01:21:49,806
I know the story.

1137
01:21:49,841 --> 01:21:51,778
No, you don't.

1138
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,884
I wasn't on the beach.

1139
01:21:54,917 --> 01:21:58,656
I was on a nearby hill
attending radar and I was

1140
01:21:58,690 --> 01:22:03,365
on the only one on duty and I
got shit faced and conked out.

1141
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:06,572
And the migs made it
through the radar and

1142
01:22:06,605 --> 01:22:09,277
massacred my company.

1143
01:22:11,914 --> 01:22:16,523
The only medal that I got
was the combat medal.

1144
01:22:16,557 --> 01:22:20,666
It means that you killed some
other poor son of a bitch.

1145
01:22:22,301 --> 01:22:26,909
It's not a flashy
medal, it's humble.

1146
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:30,016
And it should be because
there's nothing more

1147
01:22:30,048 --> 01:22:32,488
humbling than killing.

1148
01:24:02,756 --> 01:24:04,726
Where is everybody?

1149
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:06,930
Picking up Willy Crum.

1150
01:24:06,962 --> 01:24:08,432
For what?

1151
01:24:08,466 --> 01:24:10,770
Christmas dinner.

1152
01:24:10,804 --> 01:24:13,841
I couldn't talk your
mother out of it.

1153
01:24:13,877 --> 01:24:16,014
You gotta be kidding me.

1154
01:24:16,046 --> 01:24:18,350
No, it's what she wants.

1155
01:24:42,596 --> 01:24:45,000
What happened
to the piranhas?

1156
01:24:45,033 --> 01:24:48,006
Turns out, they're
illegal to own.

1157
01:24:49,475 --> 01:24:50,811
Who knew.

1158
01:24:54,118 --> 01:24:57,157
These are angel fish.

1159
01:24:58,827 --> 01:25:00,430
They're monogamous.

1160
01:25:01,931 --> 01:25:05,905
They should live a long time
if they don't eat each other.

1161
01:25:17,496 --> 01:25:21,636
I don't remember most of
last night so if I got a

1162
01:25:21,668 --> 01:25:24,106
little Irish on you...

1163
01:25:25,644 --> 01:25:27,881
Yeah, I was wrecked.

1164
01:25:27,913 --> 01:25:30,451
Right.

1165
01:25:30,485 --> 01:25:32,456
Right so...

1166
01:25:32,488 --> 01:25:34,826
No need to mention
it to your mom.

1167
01:25:34,859 --> 01:25:36,796
Any of it.

1168
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:40,403
Great.

1169
01:25:43,777 --> 01:25:45,948
Great.

1170
01:25:49,887 --> 01:25:51,457
-Just one.
-Not one.

1171
01:25:51,490 --> 01:25:52,259
-Just one.
-Not one.

1172
01:25:52,292 --> 01:25:53,225
Alright, you guys,
okay. Come on.

1173
01:25:53,261 --> 01:25:54,898
That's enough.
Settle down.

1174
01:25:54,931 --> 01:25:56,199
Come on.

1175
01:25:57,103 --> 01:25:58,939
Let's all sit down.

1176
01:26:06,185 --> 01:26:07,921
He's my boyfriend.

1177
01:26:07,956 --> 01:26:08,823
We know, sweetie.

1178
01:26:08,856 --> 01:26:09,689
I love him.

1179
01:26:09,725 --> 01:26:11,461
He's funny alright.

1180
01:26:11,496 --> 01:26:13,600
Yeah, he's a
laugh a minute.

1181
01:26:19,911 --> 01:26:21,913
Ed.

1182
01:26:21,948 --> 01:26:24,819
You wanna say a prayer.

1183
01:26:24,854 --> 01:26:26,090
Sure.

1184
01:26:33,136 --> 01:26:37,678
God, we thank you for this
food and we ask you to

1185
01:26:37,711 --> 01:26:40,748
take really good
care of Kent.

1186
01:26:40,783 --> 01:26:42,519
Amen.

1187
01:26:42,552 --> 01:26:44,722
-Amen.
-Amen.

1188
01:26:44,757 --> 01:26:46,527
Okay.

1189
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:49,065
Alright.

1190
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:52,806
Looks amazing, mom.

1191
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:54,877
There you go, Willy.

1192
01:27:05,796 --> 01:27:07,531
Not one.

1193
01:27:07,565 --> 01:27:08,201
Just one.

1194
01:27:08,234 --> 01:27:08,835
-Not one.
-Just one.

1195
01:27:08,869 --> 01:27:11,673
Hey, none of that, DeeDee.

1196
01:27:11,707 --> 01:27:12,742
-Not one.
-Just one.

1197
01:27:12,777 --> 01:27:14,980
I mean it, both of you.

1198
01:27:15,014 --> 01:27:17,217
Willy, you wanna go back
to the center or you wanna

1199
01:27:17,251 --> 01:27:20,088
stay here for dinner?

1200
01:27:20,824 --> 01:27:21,826
Just one.

1201
01:27:21,859 --> 01:27:23,762
Not one.

1202
01:27:23,796 --> 01:27:24,831
Not one.

1203
01:27:24,865 --> 01:27:30,006
Okay, you can whisper,
but just once in a while.

1204
01:27:30,042 --> 01:27:31,077
He's my boyfriend.

1205
01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:32,278
He's cute.

1206
01:27:32,313 --> 01:27:33,949
That's for certain.

1207
01:27:33,981 --> 01:27:35,216
Yes, baby.

1208
01:27:35,252 --> 01:27:36,755
I love him, you know.

1209
01:27:36,787 --> 01:27:38,156
I know, sweetheart.

1210
01:27:38,190 --> 01:27:39,827
You better.

1211
01:27:39,859 --> 01:27:41,762
Thanks for the warning.

1212
01:27:45,002 --> 01:27:47,139
Come on, dude...

1213
01:27:47,173 --> 01:27:48,676
-Willy.
-Willy.

1214
01:27:48,710 --> 01:27:49,677
For god's sakes.

1215
01:27:49,712 --> 01:27:52,049
Come on, mom, we're in
the middle of eating.

1216
01:27:52,082 --> 01:27:55,855
Willy Crum put
his finger in me.

1217
01:28:07,177 --> 01:28:10,650
His finger is in you?

1218
01:28:18,733 --> 01:28:21,704
You see, Ed, there's worse
things than being fingered.

1219
01:28:26,012 --> 01:28:29,987
The Christmas dance,
we going or what?

1220
01:28:47,284 --> 01:28:49,288
Hey, hold on there, champ.

1221
01:28:51,327 --> 01:28:53,128
Going to dance?

1222
01:28:53,163 --> 01:28:56,603
Yeah, DeeDee, we're going
to the god damn dance.

1223
01:29:57,117 --> 01:29:57,918
I'll get the tickets.

1224
01:29:57,951 --> 01:29:58,417
Okay.

1225
01:29:58,452 --> 01:29:59,686
Mrs. Kendall.

1226
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:01,290
They're not
allowed in here.

1227
01:30:01,323 --> 01:30:03,159
What the hell is going on?

1228
01:30:03,194 --> 01:30:06,365
Mr. Kendall, it was made
clear to your wife that

1229
01:30:06,399 --> 01:30:09,737
DeeDee is no longer
welcome at the box factory.

1230
01:30:09,773 --> 01:30:12,342
There won't be a problem
tonight, I promise.

1231
01:30:12,377 --> 01:30:14,213
How can you promise that?

1232
01:30:14,247 --> 01:30:17,286
Hey, let me make
you a promise.

1233
01:30:17,319 --> 01:30:19,956
You don't let my family
into this dance, you're

1234
01:30:19,992 --> 01:30:23,765
gonna need a lot more than
a fucking neck brace.

1235
01:30:23,798 --> 01:30:25,368
Please escort the Kendall's
off the premises.

1236
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:26,903
I don't want a scene here.

1237
01:30:26,938 --> 01:30:28,373
It's too late for that.

1238
01:30:28,407 --> 01:30:29,775
Hey! Hey!

1239
01:30:29,810 --> 01:30:30,344
Don't touch him.

1240
01:30:30,377 --> 01:30:31,947
Don't touch my father.

1241
01:30:33,384 --> 01:30:34,953
-Let go of me.
-Alright.

1242
01:30:34,987 --> 01:30:35,954
Stop.

1243
01:30:35,988 --> 01:30:36,589
Stop.

1244
01:30:36,623 --> 01:30:38,726
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1245
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,801
Ed, look.

1246
01:30:43,837 --> 01:30:45,239
Look.

1247
01:31:13,324 --> 01:31:14,927
Forget it.

1248
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:17,733
You okay, son.

1249
01:31:19,537 --> 01:31:20,305
Yeah, are you?

1250
01:31:20,337 --> 01:31:22,072
Yeah, I'm good.

1251
01:31:42,045 --> 01:31:44,483
I don't know
what I'm seeing.

1252
01:31:44,516 --> 01:31:47,488
You're seeing the same
thing I'm seeing.

1253
01:31:48,323 --> 01:31:52,128
They calm each other down just
like any two people in love.

1254
01:31:56,605 --> 01:31:58,208
Hi.

1255
01:31:58,242 --> 01:31:59,944
Hi.

1256
01:32:12,903 --> 01:32:15,206
What's your name?

1257
01:32:15,238 --> 01:32:18,811
This is Annie.

1258
01:32:18,846 --> 01:32:20,349
Hi, Annie.
I'm Todd.

1259
01:32:20,382 --> 01:32:21,784
Hi.

1260
01:32:23,255 --> 01:32:25,326
This is my daughter.

1261
01:32:31,270 --> 01:32:33,240
That's my family.

1262
01:32:36,246 --> 01:32:38,114
Do you like rabbits?

1263
01:32:42,189 --> 01:32:46,029
Actually, I have a rabbit.

1264
01:32:51,173 --> 01:32:53,042
Do you wanna dance?

1265
01:32:54,112 --> 01:32:55,948
We do.

1266
01:32:55,983 --> 01:32:57,885
Do you wanna?

1267
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:00,891
Yeah? Let's do it.

1268
01:33:00,925 --> 01:33:04,364
Alright, you gotta lead
though because I'm terrible.

1269
01:33:07,203 --> 01:33:09,038
We'll keep DeeDee home.

1270
01:33:09,073 --> 01:33:12,012
We'll find a way to pay
for her meds, alright?

1271
01:33:12,046 --> 01:33:15,252
I didn't give her
any meds today.

1272
01:33:15,286 --> 01:33:17,922
She should be
jumping out windows.

1273
01:33:17,957 --> 01:33:20,128
But she's not.

1274
01:33:29,444 --> 01:33:32,081
Come on.

1275
01:33:32,115 --> 01:33:33,251
Where we going?

1276
01:33:33,284 --> 01:33:35,488
I'm gonna dance
with my wife.

1277
01:33:35,523 --> 01:33:37,192
Come on.

1278
01:33:56,529 --> 01:33:59,300
I admire you, Elaine.

1279
01:33:59,333 --> 01:34:02,239
It's like more
than anything else.
