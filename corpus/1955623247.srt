1
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:16,705
And God said, "Let there be light!"
And there was light.

2
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,899
And with that first light,
was born the first shadow.

3
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,468
The shadow was not diluted by light.
The shadow remained pure.

4
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,658
120 proof!

5
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:08,901
Eclipse the light,
and bid the shadow... return!

6
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,426
Now please, Mr. Lambert.

7
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:18,948
Mr. Quinlan. There was some
mention of financial compensation?

8
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,629
Okay, I'm your man!

9
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,661
The hair, Mr Lambert.

10
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,949
The blood.

11
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,102
The likeness.

12
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,748
What's the matter, Mr. Lambert?
Surely you don't believe in any of this.

13
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,982
Hell no!

14
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,148
You understand, "Hell no" will
soon be a contradiction in terms.

15
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,739
Hell will no longer be denied.

16
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,062
Come out, Quinlan!

17
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:21,546
Jacob, Jacob, Jacob.
You're always so messy.

18
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,825
I'm here to take you back!

19
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,102
Vassey... Vassey...

20
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,579
Vassey!

21
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,061
You saw...

22
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,021
You saw...

23
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,499
No. No, I saw nothing.

24
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,550
- Shadows.
- Shadows!

25
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,948
Dear Lord, I pray thee,
forgive them for their sins.

26
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,419
Receive them into
the Kingdom of Heaven.

27
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,667
One God, forever and ever.

28
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,864
Amen.

29
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,743
Father Vassey, were they there?

30
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,306
- Did you--
- Yes.

31
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,626
- Quinlan?
- Yes.

32
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,546
Then it's over.

33
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,348
I found this.

34
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,588
Victor Lambert.

35
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,866
Did you kill him too?

36
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:52,582
- No. Dead when I got there.
- Sacrificed?

37
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:03,901
You see, they have completed
the first ordeal of the invocation.

38
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,864
The second must take place during
the darkness of the coming eclipse.

39
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,940
Stop that please, he's dead.
What evil he did died with him.

40
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,905
Don't try to glorify it as
part of some higher design.

41
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:23,668
Archbishop Quinlan was
a political threat, that's all.

42
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:28,945
With access to the Dark Texts!
The Compendium Infernus!

43
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:32,307
Bull - shit. Bullshit.

44
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:38,345
I usually find denial
in a priest to be admirable.

45
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,868
You don't believe the threat is real?

46
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,580
There was a ticket in here
for the town of Grand River.

47
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,388
Lambert took a trip there and back.

48
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,703
You think Quinlan could have
started a cell we don't know about?

49
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,470
I don't know, but I'll find out.

50
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,662
Will you hear my
confession before I go?

51
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,629
Are you truly repentent?

52
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,945
Not exactly in the heat of the night.
Rain and just 62 degrees.

53
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:55,503
WAPR Grand River, 4:57 in the A.M.

54
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,506
What the...

55
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,307
Unit 2 to base.

56
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,582
Unit 2 to base.

57
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,629
Base.

58
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,544
Base!

59
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,387
Unit 2 to base.

60
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,498
Base!

61
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,141
- Base!
- What is it, Eager?

62
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,189
Base, I'm at the, uh...

63
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,184
It's 5 o'clock in the morning, Eager. We're
the only two people awake on the whole planet.

64
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:32,025
- Can't you call me Maggie?
- Base, I'm at the cemetery.

65
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,906
I have a, uh... uhm...

66
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,868
What's the matter? Forgot
the procedural code number?

67
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:47,227
I have a disturbance here.
I'm going to investigate.

68
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:52,300
I'll just log that as a 10-100.
"Officer taking a leak."

69
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,108
Unit 2 out.

70
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,989
Who's there?

71
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:18,382
...there was some mention
of financial compensation...

72
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,947
Identify yourself!

73
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,425
I'm not playing around here!

74
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,507
- ...I'm your man...
- Oh my God!

75
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,349
- What are you doing? Is it morning already?
- Sure is, sleepyhead.

76
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,061
Morning, aunt Jen!

77
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,103
Morning, tough guy! What are
you doing up there on the roof?

78
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,059
Building an observatory
for tomorrow's eclipse!

79
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,865
You sure he's not building that
observatory to spy on Ginger Kirk?

80
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:54,622
Hey Chris, Sam wan't to know if you're building
the observatory to spy on Ginger Kirk?

81
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,549
No, but he can come up and
use the telescope if he wants!

82
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,179
Okay! See you downstairs!

83
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,064
You really want Chris to
know that I spent the night?

84
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:08,745
Honey, he's 12 years old.
He watches Melrose Place.

85
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,943
I know, but I still think we should
be a bit more discrete, don't you?

86
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,830
We have the worst kept
secret in Grand River.

87
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,505
- That is not true.
- Okay.

88
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,309
Maybe they don't know everything.

89
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,779
Morning.

90
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,863
Morning Sam. How many pieces
of french toast do you want?

91
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:00,748
I... You know, I can't really...
I'd love to stay, but I have to go and...

92
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,750
- You know, that thing I'm doing later...
- Sam.

93
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,180
Did you remember your cuffs this time?

94
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:11,263
- Yeah, right here.
- Okay.

95
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,709
- See ya.
- See ya.

96
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,418
- Hi, Sam!
- Hi, Sam!

97
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,630
Morning, Mr. and Mrs. Butterman.

98
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,943
- Morning Sam!
- George. Caesar.

99
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,069
See ya, aunt Jen.

100
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,982
Hold up there, tough guy!

101
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:10,064
I want to talk to you about why
you're up so early this morning.

102
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,429
Oh, I wanted to get the observatory done.

103
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:17,385
- You didn't have any bad dreams last night?
- Only one.

104
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,748
That guy that came over to visit us...
can't remember his name.

105
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,829
- Vic?
- Mr. Lambert, yes.

106
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:31,348
He was in it. It was all dark, and there
was something else in there with him.

107
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,064
- What was it?
- The sun was blocked.

108
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,950
There was like a huge bird, only bigger.

109
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:40,143
It was black and it was coming
right for me. I couldn't move!

110
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:43,588
Don't worry, it's not like I'm
gonna need analysis or anything,

111
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:50,505
Tell you what. How about you come by after the clinic
closes and take your old aunt Jen out to dinner.

112
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,020
- Okay.
- Have fun today, I'll see you tonight.

113
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,062
- See you later.
- See you later.

114
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,860
Look at all this traffic.

115
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:34,466
- I think this Eclipse Festival is
really working out, Sam. - Sure is.

116
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,028
- Good morning, Sheriff.
- Good morning.

117
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:42,258
- Nestor. - Hey, Lizzie. Aren't
you looking fine today? Yes, sir!

118
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,740
Go blind, Nestor, you're gonna go blind.

119
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:04,341
What you don't understand Sam, is that
hammerheads like me need guys like you.

120
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:08,100
- I'm afraid to ask, Nestor.
- Guys like you are boring in the sack!

121
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:11,587
That's why so many wives and
girlfriends show up at roadhouses

122
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,987
all lipstick, liquor, looking for a good time!

123
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:18,546
I'm no longer listening to you. Good morning, Maggie.
Anyone run off with the town while we were sleeping?

124
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,987
Sleeping? Is that what
I mean by boring? Yes, sir!

125
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:25,507
The mayor called. Said someone stole his
tomato lamps. He thinks it was old man Covey.

126
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:30,301
How could he tell? The smell? Dead skunk!

127
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:41,661
Sam, Eager hasn't radioed in for a little while.
Said he was checking out a disturbance in the cemetery.

128
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:44,265
I called Jenny's, but you'd left.

129
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,379
Okay, I'll check on my way to Covey's.
Anything else?

130
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:50,707
Well, the flyers warning people how
to view tomorrows eclipse came in.

131
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:54,347
We need someone to distribute
them to the merchants.

132
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,508
Yes, sir!

133
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,307
- Good morning, Dr. Hatcher.
- Hi Kelly. So, what have we got going today?

134
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:25,828
- Just more of the same. Shots and trots.
- George is finally bringing in Caesar.

135
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:30,020
- A neutering? Really?
- Having boyfriend troubles again?

136
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:33,660
Can I help it if I
find solace in my work?

137
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,065
Larry?

138
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,224
Larry!

139
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,628
Mary Hatcher, sweet Christ!

140
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,824
Fuck!

141
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:21,106
Paul! Get your ass out of the road!

142
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,389
Creepy dude. Probably some perv.

143
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,941
- He's a priest, I saw his collar.
- What'd I tell you?

144
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,749
Sam, uh... Chris is here.

145
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:04,427
Keep him outside, will you?
I dont want him to see his mother's grave.

146
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,499
What about it, Doc? Is he burned?

147
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:20,225
There's no evidence of an accelerant.

148
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:24,543
You see these dried vesicles? They look
like swellings caused by insect stings.

149
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:30,946
The skin is... helio-reactive?

150
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,550
We have to keep the body
out of the light.

151
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,784
- Does that mean, no flash bulbs?
- No flash bulbs!

152
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,749
Harvey, get Nestor to get a
couple of tarps down here, all right?

153
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:46,306
Move it! Before that sun gets high
enough to shine down in the grave.

154
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:50,825
I remember bringing
Larry Eggers into the world.

155
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:54,939
Son of a bitch, Sam! I can't remember
the last murder in this town.

156
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,101
- Not in my lifetime.
- Yeah.

157
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:02,104
Bring the body to my office, Sam.
Mary's remains, too.

158
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,826
What the hell happened here, Doc?

159
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,582
Damned if I know.

160
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,859
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

161
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,741
This is disgusting!

162
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:49,663
I want these curtains taken down and cleaned
properly. Now, about replacing the altar covering--

163
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:54,460
- Can I help you?
- My name is Father Jacob Vassey.

164
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:59,069
Oh yes! Your bishop called,
saying you'd be stopping by.

165
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,540
I'll be right down in
one moment Father, please.

166
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:12,744
- I'm Father Charlie Finler.
- You know this man, Father?

167
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:20,470
Vic Lambert. Yes, I had the
misfortune years ago.

168
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,587
Now what's he done?

169
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,941
He is dead.

170
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,580
Desecrated?

171
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:38,103
Yeah, looks like Larry Eggers
interrupted them. He's dead.

172
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,228
Oh my God!

173
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:49,100
Jenny, do you have any idea why
anybody would dig up your sister's grave?

174
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,947
No. Of course not.

175
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,869
Well, I heard that
Vic Lambert was back in town.

176
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:06,865
Yeah well, Vic's a creep but I
don't think he's a grave robber.

177
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:16,462
Victor Lambert was
a boozer and a bully.

178
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:20,778
Always looking for the
easy way, the quick buck.

179
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:27,062
Ah! I assume these are
what you're here for?

180
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,949
I don't know what
I'm here for, Father.

181
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:40,062
Well. These are copies of the letters old
Father Nearing wrote to Lambert about the baptism.

182
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,069
What baptism?

183
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,466
- Lambert's son, of course. His baptism.
- He had a son in this town?

184
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:52,220
Has. Christopher Hatcher, he lives
with his aunt on Broadway Road.

185
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:57,544
I don't see why you're taking such an interest in this now.
The boy hasn't been in church since his baptism!

186
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:01,787
He's probably a little hooligan,
just like his father.

187
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:06,780
Whatever happened, I bet old man
Covey had something to do with it.

188
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:10,147
Maybe now he's digging up
corpses to chow down on!

189
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:14,548
Covey, a cannibal? He's gotta have
freezers full with cold ones!

190
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,781
Let's go see.

191
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:26,426
- What?
- Go to Covey's?

192
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:29,180
Sound like something
the Sheriff should do, Chris.

193
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:33,349
Listen, the Sheriff's dating my aunt Jen,
that practically makes me the Deputy.

194
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:37,703
- Yeah, Deputy Dickless!
- Chickens! I'm going.

195
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:50,706
Thanks Harvey. Your light should do it.

196
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:57,984
After what I saw today, not sure I'll ever
wanna go back into my dark room.

197
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:03,463
Doc? Do you need me for anything else?

198
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,584
No, no... thanks again.

199
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:21,822
Okay, old son...
let's see what you're made of.

200
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:28,343
Hi! I need to speak
to the Sheriff, please.

201
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:32,341
- Sorry Father, but he is--
- It's very important. Is he in the office?

202
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:37,862
- Why do you wanna see the Sheriff?
- I need his help, trying to find a small boy.

203
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:41,660
Well, that's against the law here,
isn't it? Yes, sir!

204
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,781
Fuck off.

205
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,581
Where's the Sheriff right now?

206
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,943
He's on his way to Dr. Cole's place,
just down the road on Mechanic.

207
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:55,908
Thank you.

208
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:07,187
This is the body of
Lawrence Donald Eggers.

209
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:10,703
23 year old, caucasian male.

210
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:14,859
70 inches long, 150 pounds.

211
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:19,940
The body is in a dessicated condition
and unusually sensitive to light.

212
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:27,380
I'm beginning with a thoracic incision.

213
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,828
What the hell!?

214
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:41,465
...identify yourself...

215
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,819
Doc!

216
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,389
Doc, it's Sam!

217
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,465
Doc?

218
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:06,304
What the fuck is going on?

219
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,860
God help me, but I think I know.

220
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,308
Who the hell are you?

221
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,740
The long bones are gone.

222
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:34,383
My God! The rib...

223
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:38,381
Whose skeleton is this, Sheriff?

224
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:43,505
- Mary Hatcher.
- The boy's mother.

225
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,829
Over here, guys.

226
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:33,907
He's got the Mayor's tomato lamps!
And he's got the spots from Miss Eggers patio!

227
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:39,061
He's even got Ginger Kirk's christmas lights!
She'd never take them down.

228
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:44,784
- He must've ripped off every single light in town!
- What a psycho!

229
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:48,107
Maybe this is the freezer he
keeps all the dead bodies in.

230
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,469
What's he doing?

231
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:28,465
God damn it! You son of a bitch!

232
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,700
Vic's not dead, I mean he was just here.

233
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:48,788
Yes I know. He came to get
something from his son?

234
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,983
No, I drove him to the bus.
He didn't take anything.

235
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:55,222
Oh yes he did. Think about it.

236
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,180
What? What did he take?

237
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,421
He took a picture.

238
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:06,384
- A picture. What else?
- What do you mean, what else?

239
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:10,100
Did he take any hair, did he take any
spit, urine, fingernail clippings?

240
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,779
Father, that's enough.
That's enough, Vassey.

241
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:15,948
Listen to me! Was he alone with the boy
for any length of time, Miss Hatcher?

242
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,949
Miss Hatcher, the boy is in danger!

243
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:24,269
What? He's in danger!

244
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:27,428
Dr. Hatcher, are you leaving?
What about Caesar's operation?

245
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,708
We'll do it tomorrow. My boy is in danger! Those
should have been the first words out of your mouth!

246
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:34,426
They're out of my mouth now, Miss Hatcher!
Now please, Miss Hatcher!

247
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,941
- Can't see how this happened, just get out of my way.
- Miss Hatcher, please don't go!

248
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:42,269
Listen to me! I understand that you're angry,
but I need you to stop and listen to me!

249
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:47,906
- We're not a religious family.
- But the boy was baptized, wasn't he?

250
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:53,538
What happened at the baptism, Miss Hatcher?
Something happened. What was it?

251
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,143
What?

252
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:05,139
When the water touched him,
he... Chris bled.

253
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:11,340
- Blood?
- From the hands and feet.

254
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:18,346
Stigmata. The mark of our
Lord's passion, may the Lord have mercy.

255
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,669
I don't have time for this shit! I have to go
find Chris! Sam, I'll meet you at the station.

256
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:29,943
Sheriff, I gotta go take a closer look
at the baptismal records.

257
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,981
Wait! Wait a minute!

258
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,704
- I gotta check something out.
- I'll take you.

259
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,541
He saw us! He's gonna
put us in his freezer!

260
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:46,465
Paul! He didn't see us. No freezer.

261
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:52,184
- I wonder why Covey stole those lights?
- Getting ready for tomorrow's eclipse.

262
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,827
- Covery's probably afraid of the dark!
- My sister Kelly says,

263
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:59,028
if you look at the sun during an eclipse,
you go blind from the sun's radiation.

264
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:01,778
You do not! I look
at the sun all the time.

265
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:06,865
Yeah right, Jazz. If you can look at
the sun without going blind, then do it.

266
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,788
Okay fine, I will.

267
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:42,222
What's the deal with the stigmata thing?
I thought that was just superstitious bullshit.

268
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:47,348
The church believes that
some souls are born pure.

269
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:50,304
Free of original sin.

270
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:55,063
These people have the potential of
becoming great teachers, prophets,

271
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,302
even saints.

272
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:01,619
Now the marks of the Lord's passion,
when manifested in an infant,

273
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:07,582
at baptism in particular, they believe
it's a sign that one's been born.

274
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:22,983
Something's in the
storm drain again, Herb.

275
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:25,938
Oh my God!

276
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:48,738
What!?

277
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:52,501
Hello, son.

278
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:05,783
Stay back!

279
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:11,584
- Who are you?
- Oh, shame on you, Father.

280
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:16,103
After years of warning your congregation
to be on the lookout for my kind,

281
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:19,187
you don't even recognize me.

282
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:21,541
Depart from me, evil doers!

283
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:25,342
For I shall give
the commandment of my God!

284
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:28,942
I said get back!

285
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:33,542
The spark of his fire shall not shine!

286
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:37,465
The lights shall be dark in his tabernacle,
and his candle shall be put out with--

287
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:45,827
Eventually, the light
always fails you, priest.

288
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:58,022
Stigmata at baptism is a big deal,
it should have been reported.

289
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:01,939
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
Amen. It would have been a huge investigation.

290
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:17,263
Hang on, hold!

291
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:42,302
It was reported.

292
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:49,379
Quinlan, you son of a bitch!

293
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:03,869
Sam old son, didn't I tell you
the bodies were helio-reactive?

294
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:08,098
- Not too bright, destroying evidence like that.
- Doc?

295
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:13,981
Oh, Father Vassey.
Come to find out just how few hours

296
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:18,144
your little clique of blood-drinking
bread-eaters has left, Father?

297
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:26,548
That doesn't hurt as much as it used to.

298
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:37,348
Tell me, Jacob. In conquering Man's light,
does that mean I'm conquering Man?

299
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,662
You don't exist!

300
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:43,304
You can't exist!

301
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:49,020
Why not? By existing,
I confirm all that you believe in.

302
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:51,221
Don't I, Father?

303
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:54,509
No!

304
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:02,022
That stings. I'm getting stronger.

305
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:15,340
A couple more souls, say yours,
I'll be ready for the boy.

306
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:28,381
What the fuck was that!?

307
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:34,346
- Take me back to the station.
- God damn it, Vassey! What was it?

308
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:38,987
Take me back to the station, please.

309
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:44,820
You know what it is.
Call it whatever the hell you like.

310
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:51,018
Death, Darkness, Demon.
I don't give a shit.

311
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:55,540
Just understand that
it wants the Hatcher boy.

312
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:59,101
And it'll rip your little
town apart to get him.

313
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:06,541
Wait a sec guys. I told my aunt Jen that
I'd meet her at the clinic for dinner.

314
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:09,825
I'll see you guys tomorrow,
for the eclipse.

315
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:30,980
- Maggie, has Jenny come in yet?
- No.

316
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:33,705
- God damn! Where's Nestor?
- He's on the north side.

317
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:37,108
A whole row of sewer covers
blew up on West River.

318
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:44,344
What... What's going on?

319
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:49,383
You got a good strong flashlight at home,
Deputy? Extra batteries, candles?

320
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:52,309
- Yeah, sure.
- Come on, Jenny! Pick up, be home.

321
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:56,378
Father Morrison? Yeah. This is Vassey.
Get me the bishop, please.

322
00:47:56,710 --> 00:48:00,339
Stay at home. Lock your doors,
turn on your lights, all your lights!

323
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:03,582
Keep them on all night,
even when you sleep. Okay?

324
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:07,745
Bishop Gallo? I need you to fax me the pages
of the Dark Texts with the invocation.

325
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:09,667
- Jenny, call me at the station.
- Sam!

326
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:12,150
Do it. And call the Ostermans, call the West--
any of the families on your street

327
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:14,261
- and have them to do the same thing.
- Why?

328
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:17,740
Because there's a killer still out there, and I
don't want any dark corner left for him to hide in.

329
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:19,787
- Okay?
- No, it's not okay!

330
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:23,227
You two are scared shitless, and what's
a priest doing with two 9mm cannons?

331
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:27,258
Maggie, I don't want anyone else hurt! When
Nestor gets back here, I'm sending him home too.

332
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:31,298
So please just do me this favor.
Go home. Come back tomorrow at sun up.

333
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:33,745
Okay. Call if you need me.

334
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:38,823
Caesar?

335
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:47,110
What happened here? Caesar?

336
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:54,702
Hey boy, it's okay.

337
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:59,107
It's okay boy, don't worry. It's okay.

338
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:11,149
It's okay.

339
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:13,288
Settle down, settle down.

340
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:19,898
Stay.

341
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:23,069
Stay.

342
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:26,908
It's cold!

343
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:16,107
- Sheriff Logan.
- Sam, it's me.

344
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:19,423
- You found Chris?
- No, no, but I think I know where he is.

345
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,548
We're supposed to have dinner tonight at
the clinic, that's where he's gonna meet me.

346
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:26,180
- I'm way across town, you can get there faster, Sam.
- Okay, hold on a sec.

347
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:31,708
- Base to unit 2. Nestor, are you still out there?
- Come on, break it up!

348
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:34,259
Nestor, it's Sam damn it, do you read me?

349
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:37,629
Right now!

350
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,906
- Go ahead.
- You still out on West River road?

351
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:44,863
Just finishing up.
It's the damndest thing, Sam.

352
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:47,659
I've had to break up three
fights since I've been here.

353
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:51,665
Is everyone acting like they got a
blowtorch up their ass? Yes, sir!

354
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:54,269
It's the Demon.

355
00:50:57,910 --> 00:51:00,902
- Nestor...
- Boys! Get outta here!

356
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:04,381
Swing by Jenny's clinic,
find Chris and bring him here.

357
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:07,742
I'm on my way, Sam. Unit 2 out.

358
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:11,629
Jenny, I got Nestor going to get Chris.
He's gonna bring him here.

359
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:14,549
Okay, I'll call and make
sure he's there. I love you.

360
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:17,947
Its presence has begun to
poison your town and its people.

361
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:21,061
It'll get worse.

362
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:43,462
Hey Jen!

363
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:48,507
Hey Jen? Hey Jen?

364
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:56,739
Hey Jen?

365
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:03,864
Hey Jen?

366
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:57,666
Chris? Oh God!

367
00:52:58,230 --> 00:52:59,345
Chris!

368
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:26,788
Hatcher? Chris Hatcher?

369
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:58,663
Nestor, Nestor! Come on!
We gotta go! We gotta go!

370
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:03,621
- Oh God!
- Time for you to come, Christopher.

371
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:06,788
- Who the hell are you!?
- I'm part of you.

372
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:11,858
I'm the one in your dreams.
I'm the one you want to be with.

373
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:16,063
God is a butcher, boy.

374
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:21,462
- He divides to conquer.
- I don't understand.

375
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:25,222
You will. Our alignment is coming.

376
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:28,662
Sun and moon, darkness at noon.

377
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:34,389
Come with me. Let me prepare you.

378
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:00,342
Go Chris!

379
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:03,419
Get out! Run!

380
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:07,504
You've made it harder for him, Nestor.

381
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:12,021
Am I fucked? Yes, sir...

382
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:21,380
Hell would have come here to you
if you'd been more patient.

383
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:09,980
Nestor, it's Sam. Come in.

384
00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:27,984
Nestor-- Where the fuck are you!?

385
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:47,509
Jenny!

386
00:56:57,230 --> 00:56:58,948
- Drive!
- Chris!

387
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:00,669
Drive!

388
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:07,183
Just hang on! It's okay.

389
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:10,583
Please.

390
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:23,987
Okay Chris, I'm gonna stop
the car and you get in, okay?

391
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:29,385
Come on honey, get in the car!
Get in the car!

392
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:34,949
You okay?

393
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:40,663
Nestor is dead! One of those dogs things
got him, and there was a man with them!

394
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:43,788
It's okay, it's okay. Honey,
you're okay now, okay you're safe.

395
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:49,340
Get the fuck off me, you piece of shit!

396
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:08,062
He is not dead! We need light
to kill him, lots of light!

397
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:11,069
- Lights? Where?
- I know where!

398
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:20,429
Damn pirate company feeding me
that defective Canadian electricity!

399
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:27,102
No no, you don't.
These lights are mine!

400
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:51,023
Chris, wait!

401
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:54,623
Over here, ugly!

402
00:58:56,550 --> 00:58:59,462
The lights, the lights!
Turn on the lights!

403
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:09,468
Fuck me, Old Nick!

404
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:16,302
Dog gone!

405
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:25,781
Hello. Jenny, where-- where are you?

406
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:29,745
You'll never believe me if I told you.
Sam, I got Chris.

407
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:33,825
Honey, Nestor is dead.

408
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:42,459
How?

409
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:49,989
Okay. We'll meet you and Chris there.
And Jenny, just stay put there, all right?

410
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:54,058
Because we're dealing with much more
than a cult, okay? Okay. See you soon.

411
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:59,220
She found the boy?
I have to see him.

412
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:37,548
There's nothing we can do
here, Sheriff. Come on.

413
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:51,387
Keep an eye out, Vassey.

414
01:01:57,190 --> 01:01:58,623
Vassey!

415
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:01,104
Yeah.

416
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:04,945
I like it. Let's go.

417
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:32,940
I thought you were
supposed to be a priest.

418
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:39,264
Praise be the Lord, my strength, who teacheth
my hands to war, and my fingers to fight.

419
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:41,626
- The Book of Psalms.
- Yeah.

420
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:45,981
Sounds more like the
book of rationalizations.

421
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:50,426
The Bible, by any other name.

422
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:03,461
- Okay Chris, I want you to go inside--
- And turn on all the lights, way ahead of you.

423
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:07,059
Come on.

424
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:44,462
- Hey.
- Sam.

425
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:54,709
Hi there Sheriff! We're gonna light this
joint up like a cathouse in Vegas!

426
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:58,469
I see you recruited the town nut.

427
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:06,019
- Hey, what the hell happened!?
- It's nothing, you wouldn't believe even if I told you.

428
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:07,983
Sheriff.

429
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:11,106
- Harvey?
- Where's the boy?

430
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:12,943
In the house.

431
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:23,106
Wait, wait! Let's just get the stuff
out of the back of the truck, okay?

432
01:04:55,670 --> 01:04:57,661
Chris!

433
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,629
Chris!

434
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:12,423
Aunt Jen, what are those
people doing outside?

435
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:17,109
I don't know... but
we're gonna figure it out.

436
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:27,626
- Could we end up like that?
- Not as long as we stay near you.

437
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:39,306
How come you are so afraid of Chris?

438
01:05:40,310 --> 01:05:44,701
I can... feel his truth, his light.

439
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:47,619
It's just a bit unsettling, that's all.

440
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:50,629
When I held him in my arms
for that first time, I...

441
01:05:50,990 --> 01:05:53,709
felt that light, that thing
you're talking about,

442
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:57,181
and I knew that he
trusted me completely.

443
01:05:57,550 --> 01:06:03,022
And I think I am the person I am today
because I didn't wanna fail that trust.

444
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:06,141
I just discovered the opposite.

445
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:09,582
How? There is nothing evil
or cruel about Chris.

446
01:06:10,110 --> 01:06:13,466
No no! Not him. Me.

447
01:06:13,830 --> 01:06:18,062
The boy makes you face the hidden
part of yourself. For you, strength.

448
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:19,908
And for you?

449
01:06:26,670 --> 01:06:29,423
- Hey. Is that my coffee?
- Yeah.

450
01:06:29,790 --> 01:06:33,544
Thanks. Listen, I gotta go back in the
kitchen with Jenny and Father Vassey.

451
01:06:33,830 --> 01:06:36,788
You wanna help Mr. Covey
with the generator?

452
01:06:39,390 --> 01:06:41,028
- Okay.
- Good.

453
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:44,870
Be careful, it's heavy.

454
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:52,781
It's okay, boy.

455
01:06:56,230 --> 01:06:58,027
I don't bite.

456
01:06:58,510 --> 01:07:01,422
I was with the Christian
relief effort in Somalia.

457
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:06,699
One sunday, a local warlord objected
to a sermon I was giving against greed.

458
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:12,465
So he had his men... machine gun
all the people as he left the church.

459
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:16,220
- Oh my God!
- No, no, God wasn't there.

460
01:07:18,270 --> 01:07:21,899
Oh I... prayed to Him,
and I screamed to Him...

461
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:28,185
Nothing. I might as well have been
a caveman, howling at the moon.

462
01:07:33,030 --> 01:07:37,660
I understood then and there that...
God couldn't exist.

463
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:42,826
The next day I woke up, got a gun,
tracked down the warlord and his men...

464
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:47,743
- and I killed them.
- Good old-fashioned Old Testament justice, huh?

465
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:52,388
An eye for an eye. Boy, the
traditionalists must have loved you.

466
01:07:53,030 --> 01:07:56,545
They went one better, Sheriff.
They trained me.

467
01:07:57,430 --> 01:08:03,380
You see, the Church needs protection too.
Just like any other political organization.

468
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:10,103
There really are Devils and Angels.

469
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:15,585
Yes. And sinners who
really will go to Hell.

470
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:20,142
Well, maybe we can delay your departure,
Father. Anything here that can help us?

471
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:35,824
Good evening, Mr. Butterman.

472
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:41,380
Have... have you come for me?
I killed my wife, you know!

473
01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:47,818
Your soul's all used up.
Hardly worth the effort of taking.

474
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:57,421
I hit her in the head with the axe...
I don't know why! I love my wife!

475
01:08:58,670 --> 01:09:01,343
Why... why did I kill her?

476
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:03,661
It was the sound.

477
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:07,467
The sound of the blade,
burying itself in her skull.

478
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:13,506
- Wouldn't you like to hear it again?
- Yeah!

479
01:09:14,670 --> 01:09:16,262
Look.

480
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:27,868
Go ahead.

481
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:34,942
Again.

482
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:41,908
According to the Dark Text,
this is our Demon.

483
01:09:42,270 --> 01:09:45,103
A Factor Obscurantis,
maker or builder of shadows.

484
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:48,024
- Shadowbuilder?
- That's right.

485
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:53,187
Anyway, they're conjured up
to collect souls.

486
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:57,066
- Souls give them strength to carry out a task.
- What task?

487
01:09:57,350 --> 01:10:02,549
Oh, it all depends. Quinlan's sect believed
in the perfect beauty of the Void.

488
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:05,025
Better known as Hell.

489
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:10,505
They feel that God, in his
arrogance, polluted the Void

490
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:13,827
with this... us, Creation, all of Creation.

491
01:10:14,150 --> 01:10:19,508
The Shadowbuilder said that God...
separated things so He could control them.

492
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:23,026
What else did he say, honey?

493
01:10:24,510 --> 01:10:27,468
Well, he said that everything
was coming to align.

494
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:30,669
The sun and the moon,
and dark at noon.

495
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:32,542
- It's the eclipse.
- Yes.

496
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:37,466
It's a chance for the Demon to build
a door between his world and ours.

497
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:39,384
How?

498
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:45,584
Here.

499
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:51,108
Wait a minute!
That's me, isn't it?

500
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:55,059
No. That is not you, honey.

501
01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:04,789
You said the Shadowbuilder
has to gather enough souls

502
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:08,466
so he's strong enough to perform
some task. How many souls?

503
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:11,666
- How old is the boy?
- I'm twelve,

504
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:15,147
and my name is Chris, not boy! Why?

505
01:11:18,830 --> 01:11:23,267
Half of life is spent in day,
half of life is spent in the dark.

506
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:28,502
The Demon needs one soul for
each year the boy spent in God's light.

507
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:32,579
Well, that would be six. So we got...

508
01:11:34,510 --> 01:11:39,425
Doc, Father Finler and Larry Eggers.

509
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:42,579
- Victor Lambert.
- And Nestor.

510
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:44,588
No, no.

511
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:48,988
From what you told me earlier, the Deputy was
killed by one of the Demon's manifestations.

512
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:52,666
- His soul would have passed way before--
- It was eaten?

513
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:54,909
Taken.

514
01:11:57,870 --> 01:11:59,098
Taken.

515
01:11:59,870 --> 01:12:02,668
- All right, that's four. Two left.
- Wait a sec!

516
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:07,826
- I saw Kelly's car in the clinic
parking lot when I left. - Oh God!

517
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:15,020
And when he gets six, there will be no amount
of Man-made light that's gonna hurt him.

518
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:20,139
- The Demon will come for the kid, unless...
- Unless what?

519
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:25,949
Unless he's... useless to him.

520
01:12:30,830 --> 01:12:32,866
Speak of the Devil.

521
01:12:57,630 --> 01:12:59,541
Move, move! Jenny, start the generator.

522
01:12:59,830 --> 01:13:02,390
Covey, check outside the house, make sure
there's no one out back there.

523
01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:05,548
Chris, you stay with Vassey.
Go! Move, move!

524
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:17,063
- Vassey! Vassey, no!
- Drop the gun, Vassey! Now!

525
01:13:17,430 --> 01:13:22,220
I kill the boy, all this ends!
No invocation! No more lost souls!

526
01:13:22,990 --> 01:13:25,868
No more Demons to face?
Drop the fucking gun!

527
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:30,422
You decide, Sheriff!
Your town, this world or the boy?

528
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:33,224
Killing Chris won't bring
your soul back, Vassey.

529
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:36,945
The Shadowbuilder is stronger in the
dark, he's getting inside our heads!

530
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:52,827
Looks like it's gonna be
a long night, kiddies!

531
01:14:07,830 --> 01:14:09,502
Jenny, get Chris upstairs!

532
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:13,709
Covey, you keep an eye on him.
I'll find out who's trying to get in.

533
01:14:25,910 --> 01:14:30,222
- The whole block is out.
- ...some things are better done in dark...

534
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:35,985
- Eager?
- ...I've come to say goodbye, Maggie...

535
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:39,789
You're so cold.

536
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:52,028
Larry?

537
01:14:57,830 --> 01:15:01,743
- He always felt shy around you.
- He?

538
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:05,940
He. Me. We.

539
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:10,706
Jesus asked him, "What is thy name?"

540
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:14,586
And he said, "Legion."

541
01:15:21,790 --> 01:15:24,384
Larry, wait. I-- I can't.

542
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:30,100
Of course you can, Maggie.
Maggie, my sweet.

543
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:35,346
Larry, stop.

544
01:15:37,670 --> 01:15:40,946
Call me... Eager.

545
01:15:48,830 --> 01:15:49,945
Paul!

546
01:16:43,070 --> 01:16:44,947
- We need light!
- I'll go get one!

547
01:16:45,110 --> 01:16:46,862
No, Chris! Chris! Wait!

548
01:16:47,910 --> 01:16:49,901
Chris! Chris!

549
01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:52,025
Chris!

550
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:54,900
Hello, aunt Jennifer.

551
01:16:58,070 --> 01:17:00,026
How primitive.

552
01:17:18,950 --> 01:17:22,226
Harvey! Drop 'em. Drop 'em.

553
01:17:22,590 --> 01:17:24,228
Drop it. Covey--

554
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:43,221
Jesus! Are you all right?

555
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:47,385
I'm all right, I'm all right!
Where's the boy?

556
01:17:48,150 --> 01:17:49,583
Aunt Jen!

557
01:18:02,190 --> 01:18:03,589
Christopher.

558
01:18:25,510 --> 01:18:27,307
It's time, Christopher.

559
01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:35,139
Stop!

560
01:18:36,510 --> 01:18:41,584
I can't stop, Christopher.
In your dreams, you've always known that.

561
01:18:45,310 --> 01:18:49,189
I'll jump, fuckface!
Then you'll have no sacrifice!

562
01:18:51,270 --> 01:18:52,908
Get away from him!

563
01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:56,946
Jacob? You're a positive God-send.

564
01:18:58,310 --> 01:18:59,379
No!

565
01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:04,860
I saw what you did in New York, priest.
I saw you murder those people.

566
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:08,228
Your soul is forfeit.

567
01:19:09,070 --> 01:19:11,709
- Shall I take it now?
- No!

568
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:17,388
You want those last precious hours?

569
01:19:18,110 --> 01:19:21,307
Yes! Please, please!

570
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:23,661
I thought as much.

571
01:19:27,190 --> 01:19:28,509
Let him go!

572
01:19:29,710 --> 01:19:33,749
Come with me Christopher,
and they get to live.

573
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:35,503
Stop it!

574
01:19:36,070 --> 01:19:39,426
I need you to choose me.

575
01:19:39,710 --> 01:19:41,541
- It's your destiny.
- No!

576
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:46,109
- Decide!
- No!

578
01:19:55,430 --> 01:19:58,422
- I'll come.
- Christopher, how angelic you are.

579
01:20:06,150 --> 01:20:08,983
No! No!

580
01:20:15,550 --> 01:20:16,585
Chris.

581
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:19,824
Chris?

582
01:20:23,830 --> 01:20:26,981
Where is he? Where is he?

583
01:20:30,230 --> 01:20:32,107
Talk for me, Vassey!

584
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:36,266
Traded... he traded... himself for us.

585
01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:03,824
Jenny!

586
01:21:04,870 --> 01:21:07,100
- Jenny.
- Give me the keys, Sam!

587
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:09,989
No, look, I'll drive, okay? We just gotta
figure out which direction they're in.

588
01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:12,499
- I know where he took the boy.
- Where?

589
01:21:12,790 --> 01:21:18,547
It's where Old Nick hides out during the day.
You find the Devil where it's dark!

590
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:26,542
- Hey, Sam?
- Yeah?

591
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:31,861
- Thanks for coming. - It's my own damn fault,
I'm the one that wanted us to be discrete!

592
01:21:32,910 --> 01:21:37,779
- What do you mean? - You can't get any more
discrete than sneaking around here, can you?

593
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:59,098
- Sam, look! It's Chris's shoe!
- Jenny! Wait, wait!

594
01:22:02,230 --> 01:22:03,868
I think it's a trap.

595
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:18,581
Sam! Sam! Oh God!

596
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:22,665
Sam!

597
01:22:24,990 --> 01:22:26,059
Sam!

598
01:22:38,510 --> 01:22:40,546
- Morning, Padre.
- Morning.

599
01:22:41,710 --> 01:22:43,189
The boy?

600
01:22:43,670 --> 01:22:47,265
Sam... the Sheriff and Miss Hatcher,
they went to bring the boy home.

601
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:50,025
- Where?
- The sewers.

602
01:22:51,390 --> 01:22:54,427
- Uh-uh.
- What? What? Do you know something?

603
01:22:59,470 --> 01:23:03,145
- What?
- Here! What's that look like there?

604
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:08,229
I'll be God damned! An altar.

605
01:23:08,630 --> 01:23:13,420
No greater act of blasphemy than to
sacrifice the boy in the house of God.

606
01:23:54,350 --> 01:23:55,783
...it sanctified...

607
01:23:56,270 --> 01:24:01,060
...and day seventh the blessed God and...

608
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:08,469
...made had he which work his all from
day seventh the on rested he and...

609
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:12,584
...day sixth the morning
the and evening the and...

610
01:24:13,790 --> 01:24:19,501
...good very was it, behold, and made
had he that every thing saw God and...

611
01:24:22,110 --> 01:24:26,786
...heaven the of firmament

612
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:35,861
...the were morning the
and evening the and...

613
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:40,623
...good was it that saw God and
darkness the from light divide to and...

614
01:24:43,310 --> 01:24:46,302
...night the over and day
the over rule to and...

615
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:54,829
...them he created female and male,
him he created God of image the in...

616
01:24:58,990 --> 01:25:00,423
Die!

617
01:25:18,990 --> 01:25:20,059
Chris!

618
01:25:23,710 --> 01:25:25,701
Observe, little bitch!

619
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:37,505
...stars the made he, night the
rule to light lesser the and...

620
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:40,426
What is that gibberish
Old Nick is spouting?

621
01:25:40,710 --> 01:25:44,305
The Book of Genesis, in reverse.
He's trying to undo Creation.

622
01:25:46,270 --> 01:25:50,548
...appear land dry the let and,
place one unto together...

623
01:25:51,470 --> 01:25:57,909
...gathered be heaven the under
waters the let, said God and...

624
01:25:59,310 --> 01:26:03,303
...day second the were morning
the and evening the and...

625
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:06,902
...heaven firmament the called God and...

626
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:09,022
Get her out of here.

627
01:26:11,590 --> 01:26:15,105
The Spirit of God moved
upon the face of the waters.

628
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:22,630
And God said, "Let there be light!""
And there was light!

629
01:26:27,270 --> 01:26:31,900
And God saw... the light was good!

630
01:26:32,790 --> 01:26:35,782
...day first the were morning
the and evening the and...

631
01:26:36,670 --> 01:26:39,662
...night called he darkness the and...

632
01:26:40,390 --> 01:26:43,507
And God divided the light
from the darkness!

633
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:48,100
- And God called the light day!
- ...day light the called God and...

634
01:26:50,950 --> 01:26:55,865
- Have you come to beg for your salvation, priest?
- You have none to offer.

635
01:26:56,230 --> 01:26:59,586
Beg me anyway. Beg me!

636
01:26:59,910 --> 01:27:02,504
For the boy's life.

637
01:27:02,910 --> 01:27:04,662
Wake up, Chris.

638
01:27:05,870 --> 01:27:08,589
Look at him, Chris. Look at him!

639
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:11,585
He is terrified of you.

640
01:27:12,550 --> 01:27:15,189
I know. I was.

641
01:27:15,790 --> 01:27:18,623
He wanted me to believe
you wouldn't come.

642
01:27:18,910 --> 01:27:22,380
People trusted me once,
and I watched them die.

643
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:24,547
Good practice.

644
01:27:26,990 --> 01:27:28,105
No!

645
01:27:51,190 --> 01:27:52,339
Father!

646
01:27:57,590 --> 01:28:00,229
- Have faith in me, Chris!
- I do, Father!

647
01:28:00,790 --> 01:28:04,863
...darkness and void and
form without was earth...

648
01:28:38,990 --> 01:28:40,867
I'll see you in Hell.

649
01:28:44,350 --> 01:28:45,544
No!

650
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:12,622
Father! Why have you forsaken me!?

651
01:29:29,190 --> 01:29:34,139
They've abandoned you, Christopher!
I'll have your soul, boy!

652
01:29:34,430 --> 01:29:36,421
- Not today!
- Yes!

653
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:21,948
Thanks for the loan.

654
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:24,269
You're welcome!

655
01:30:24,870 --> 01:30:27,100
- I thought you were dead!
- That makes two of us.

656
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:04,902
The Shadowbuilder was right.
You were a God-send.
