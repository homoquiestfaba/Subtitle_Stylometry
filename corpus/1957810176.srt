1
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:49,182
It's six AM in the morning,

2
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,485
and you're out there
mowing the lawn.

3
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,590
Get a real job!

4
00:00:56,624 --> 00:00:58,292
Oh, I hate my neighbors.

5
00:01:00,662 --> 00:01:02,995
If you hired people
with citizenships,

6
00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:05,665
they wouldn't have
to start this early.

7
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:07,467
Hiding from the government.

8
00:02:56,778 --> 00:02:58,680
Whew, what do I
wear, what do I wear?

9
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:01,515
Too slutty,

10
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,885
not bitchy enough.

11
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:07,887
Ugh!

12
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:12,625
Ooh, this is the one.

13
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:17,632
This is the one that says
I'm going to fuck you so hard

14
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,601
you won't even
know what hit you.

15
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,977
Not appropriate.

16
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:35,583
Canceled, thumbs down, ew.

17
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:39,687
Oh God, those brothers
are so annoying.

18
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:44,924
Ugh, why does everyone
have a podcast?

19
00:03:44,926 --> 00:03:47,927
It should be illegal
to start a podcast.

20
00:03:47,929 --> 00:03:50,529
It's just, it's just so stupid.

21
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:53,132
I don't know why all these
people have podcasts.

22
00:03:53,134 --> 00:03:56,569
It's just what do you
have to talk about?

23
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:58,436
Who are you?

24
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,473
Really?

25
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:04,610
I just, I don't care who you're
interviewing today, I don't.

26
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:05,980
Thumbs down.

27
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:12,120
Prank call neighbor.

28
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:27,332
Your husband has been
sleeping with me.

29
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:31,572
It's been adventurous
and he gave me herpes.

30
00:04:42,016 --> 00:04:43,016
Check.

31
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:46,921
Mm, dog poop, not ready.

32
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:49,690
Shut down winery.

33
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:52,894
Shut down winery?

34
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:03,804
Karen.

35
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,072
Hey guys.

36
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:07,907
Poodles.

37
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:08,841
How you doing hun?

38
00:05:08,843 --> 00:05:09,575
You're looking pretty good.

39
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:10,910
Thank you.

40
00:05:10,912 --> 00:05:12,410
Thank you.

41
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,982
Today is pretty special for
me today just so you all know.

42
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,683
I am about to shut
down a business

43
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:20,588
I have been working on
closing for like 15 years.

44
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:22,988
Oh, you've always
had an eye and a ear

45
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,491
for taking the trash out.

46
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:28,627
Which is why we
actually came by actually.

47
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:32,298
Mrs. Hargrave, she's left
her giant cans exposed again

48
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,899
just rolling around
in the breeze

49
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:36,467
right there on the
sidewalk for all to see.

50
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,105
He's talking about the trash.

51
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,740
Yeah, yeah, I
know, she's a whore.

52
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:43,742
She's had sex with
all our neighbors,

53
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:44,979
it's just disgusting.

54
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:47,813
We need to get her
out of the neighborhood.

55
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:49,315
It's bad for us all.

56
00:05:49,317 --> 00:05:50,749
I can assure you,

57
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:55,223
in this cul-de-sac soap
opera, we are not the daddies.

58
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,523
No, we're not.

59
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:59,091
Well, I'm not anyway.

60
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:00,962
I don't know, I plead the fifth.

61
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:03,963
I'm not the daddy.

62
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:08,970
Anyway, I have a lot to do today

63
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:11,402
so I have to go
get back to work,

64
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:15,641
but let's go shopping,
have some coffee soon?

65
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:17,610
Let's make it happen.

66
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:19,278
I have a meeting
I think tomorrow.

67
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,279
Can you come?

68
00:06:20,281 --> 00:06:22,281
We'd really love your support.

69
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:23,749
Of course.

70
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:25,985
And then we should all
file individual complaints

71
00:06:25,987 --> 00:06:26,987
about Helen.

72
00:06:28,022 --> 00:06:30,289
Let's get this bitch
out of our neighborhood.

73
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,123
Definitely.

74
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,191
All for one.

75
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:33,426
One for all.

76
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:35,528
Oh.

77
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:37,897
Taking back the neighborhood.

78
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:39,397
I'd sleep with her, would you?

79
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,799
Oh God, really?

80
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:43,170
Why are you even bringing
that up right now?

81
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:55,750
Move your stupid children!

82
00:06:56,651 --> 00:06:58,951
Some people have jobs!

83
00:06:58,953 --> 00:07:02,323
And don't wear the
same outfit every day.

84
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:05,760
I hate you, Karen.

85
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,850
I think everything
is gonna be fine.

86
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:35,020
I mean we've got
everything covered.

87
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:38,357
I know she's brutal, but
I also know my business.

88
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:39,992
I'll handle her.

89
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:42,328
I just don't even want
to see her smug face today.

90
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,196
Like we have a lot going on

91
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:45,798
and I'd really rather
lick skunked wine

92
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,533
off the bottom of the
barrels in the back

93
00:07:47,535 --> 00:07:49,201
than to listen to her
little beaver mouth

94
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:51,236
dictating codes this morning.

95
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:54,139
Hey, don't be disrespecting
my barrels, Hank

96
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,875
and don't disrespect beavers.

97
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:57,943
They're noble creatures.

98
00:07:57,945 --> 00:07:58,945
True.

99
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:02,316
Let's get it together
and started for the day.

100
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:07,553
I'll go do the run through of
the new area before the audit

101
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:10,456
to make sure it's looking
good and situated.

102
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,458
Y'all get situated.

103
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,461
We'll get her in and out and
then we can focus on the event

104
00:08:15,463 --> 00:08:16,895
and the brand launch.

105
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,364
Hells yeah.

106
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:21,033
Let's sell the shit
out of this wine.

107
00:08:21,035 --> 00:08:23,402
Hey, maybe save that
graphic enthusiasm

108
00:08:23,404 --> 00:08:26,607
for when after Karen, the
sucker of souls, passes through.

109
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:30,242
Look, I'm pretty sure
she has a forum dedicated

110
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:33,014
to anything that sounds
remotely like working joyfully.

111
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:43,491
Fucking bitch.

112
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:46,793
Hello?

113
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:52,199
No, no operator, operator,
operator, operator.

114
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:57,770
Are you really coming at me
right now, seriously, seriously?

115
00:08:57,772 --> 00:09:00,806
Operator, operator.

116
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:04,977
I was just harassed by
one of your employees.

117
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:08,247
Yes, no she harassed me
and she tried to kill me.

118
00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:10,816
She literally
tried to murder me.

119
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:12,918
I'm shaken right
now, I'm shaken.

120
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,589
I don't know if I'm going
to be able to go to work.

121
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:18,791
I'm injured, I'm injured.

122
00:09:18,793 --> 00:09:20,192
I was assaulted.

123
00:09:20,194 --> 00:09:24,129
I was totally, totally assaulted
by that fucking barista.

124
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:25,798
No, no, no, I'm
not getting loud,

125
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,832
I am not getting loud,

126
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:29,068
I am just upset.

127
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,937
I am very, very hurt right now

128
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:34,373
that you would hire
somebody so incompetent.

129
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,675
Look, I am a compliance officer,

130
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:38,877
this is what I do for a living

131
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,814
and I also have a lot
of followers online,

132
00:09:41,816 --> 00:09:45,117
okay and I will
expose your business.

133
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:48,120
I will expose you to the world

134
00:09:48,122 --> 00:09:49,723
about what this woman did to me.

135
00:10:15,483 --> 00:10:16,648
Hank.

136
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,883
Hello, Karen.

137
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:20,085
This so good to have
you with us again.

138
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:22,287
Listen, I don't
need your employees

139
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:27,294
listening to what we're
saying and continue.

140
00:10:28,496 --> 00:10:30,462
Well, I want to thank
you for coming back in.

141
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:33,232
Having someone of your expertise
on operational procedures

142
00:10:33,234 --> 00:10:35,868
is so informative.

143
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,304
Unvaluable, I mean
invaluable of course.

144
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:42,908
Yeah, I see that your
team has really improved

145
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,443
since the last walkthrough,

146
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:46,947
but I have to tell
you it's still subpar.

147
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,717
My third time this month,

148
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:53,154
it's becoming to be
a regular thing here.

149
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:00,092
I understand and I thank
you for the extra visits.

150
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:03,295
However, we do have
another tasting event,

151
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:06,165
larger scale tomorrow night.

152
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:10,369
It will have a live band, a
discounted flight package,

153
00:11:10,371 --> 00:11:11,939
with a few new selections.

154
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,175
I'll have Troy walk you
through it step by step.

155
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:18,110
It should be pretty standard.

156
00:11:18,112 --> 00:11:19,612
Pretty standard, yeah.

157
00:11:19,614 --> 00:11:22,848
Wait, Troy, we need to talk
about the last time I was here

158
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,920
because I just don't
want a repeat of this.

159
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,087
The bottles, okay the bottles,

160
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:33,425
they were not wiped
down correctly, okay?

161
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:36,461
You are not supposed to clean
things from bottom to top.

162
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:39,698
It's always supposed
to be top to bottom.

163
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,700
Do you know why?

164
00:11:41,536 --> 00:11:42,803
Do you know why, Dallas?

165
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:46,038
The bottles are sealed.

166
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,510
Yes, yes, but when you
wipe from bottom to top,

167
00:11:50,512 --> 00:11:55,482
you are spreading bacteria,
bacteria, germs everywhere.

168
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:59,552
You're touching the
bottom of something

169
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:01,019
that holds everything

170
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:03,088
and you're just
moving it to the top.

171
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,958
Bacteria and germs
all over the place.

172
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,896
We just can't have
that here, okay?

173
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,900
Look, the cloth, the cloth, Hank

174
00:12:14,268 --> 00:12:18,872
was not soaked in warm,
soapy antibacterial solution.

175
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:22,809
Okay, yeah?

176
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:25,344
Okay, fair.

177
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:28,814
Laundry was not
provided to the staff.

178
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:31,551
Did you see what those
people look like?

179
00:12:31,553 --> 00:12:35,756
Troy looks like he hasn't
changed his shirt in a week.

180
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:39,091
He likes to get things,

181
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:40,727
he works better that way.

182
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:42,629
That is not acceptable.

183
00:12:42,631 --> 00:12:44,697
That is just, that
is just unacceptable.

184
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:48,435
Now, we need to talk
about your sinks, okay?

185
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:52,705
Okay.

186
00:12:52,707 --> 00:12:54,206
All right, if you're
doing a new expansion,

187
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,676
you really have to pay
attention to the metal.

188
00:12:56,678 --> 00:12:57,943
There's spots all over here.

189
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:00,178
And do you know what
that means, Hank?

190
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,014
Do you know what this means?

191
00:13:02,016 --> 00:13:03,516
Water spots.

192
00:13:03,518 --> 00:13:06,151
No rust, rust is eminent here.

193
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:08,222
And do you know
what rust causes?

194
00:13:10,558 --> 00:13:11,558
Uh...

195
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,959
Cancer.

196
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:17,732
It spreads, it's a disease,
it takes over everything.

197
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,365
Now the staff, the walkthrough,

198
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:23,902
they have improved
fundamentally, but you know what?

199
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:25,571
It's still subpar.

200
00:13:25,573 --> 00:13:26,838
It's still subpar.

201
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,579
And I am just worried
that if you do expand,

202
00:13:32,747 --> 00:13:35,750
it is not gonna be up
to code or my standards.

203
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,418
Okay, I understand.

204
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,553
Come and I'll show you.

205
00:13:40,555 --> 00:13:41,989
Oh, okay.

206
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,570
She is the devil, pure evil.

207
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:59,706
I don't know, maybe she
just needs to have a drink.

208
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,039
I've never met a
woman I couldn't charm

209
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,578
with a few fruity notes
and a nice conversation.

210
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:07,814
I say skip the conversation
and drink the wine yourself,

211
00:14:07,816 --> 00:14:09,716
massive amounts.

212
00:14:09,718 --> 00:14:10,916
I wouldn't waste good wine

213
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:12,386
on trying to get
any charm outta her.

214
00:14:13,822 --> 00:14:17,489
Huh, probably just needs
to feel utilized, important.

215
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:20,292
Maybe she just needs a
purpose in life, you know?

216
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:22,096
She would make a
great speed bump.

217
00:14:23,832 --> 00:14:26,164
She is pretty cute, Hank.

218
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,267
Would you ask her out?

219
00:14:28,703 --> 00:14:32,204
I don't know about
that, Troy, but you,

220
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:34,906
why don't you invite her
to your little party?

221
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:37,777
See if she wants to help
you host that brand launch?

222
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:41,781
Because maybe afterwards
she can check your plumbing,

223
00:14:41,783 --> 00:14:45,317
give you a golden seal of
approval while she's down there.

224
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:46,453
My toilets are fine.

225
00:14:47,488 --> 00:14:49,287
That snake really does work.

226
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,425
Not what I was meaning at all.

227
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,863
Maybe I will take
one for the team.

228
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,296
I can try and find out
where she's coming from,

229
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,833
maybe even see if I can make
her ease up on her review

230
00:15:00,835 --> 00:15:01,836
for the new station.

231
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:04,469
I don't know if there's anything

232
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:05,937
that can get that
woman to ease up.

233
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:09,040
I mean, she's like a walking
constipation with a hemorrhoid.

234
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:10,442
And the only thing
more irritating

235
00:15:10,444 --> 00:15:11,778
is what she could possibly
do to the business

236
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,014
if she leaves here with
the mindset to do so.

237
00:15:15,884 --> 00:15:17,184
That's a horrid thought.

238
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,320
As you can see,

239
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:25,758
we took your advice on
giving more space to the area

240
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,860
where air is required
for the food,

241
00:15:27,862 --> 00:15:31,764
also for movements,
flow of foot traffic

242
00:15:31,766 --> 00:15:36,034
and to improve the interaction
between staff and customer.

243
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:40,573
Yes, I see that you have
taken the compliance station

244
00:15:40,575 --> 00:15:44,844
more effective for the customers
to be situated in there.

245
00:15:44,846 --> 00:15:47,179
Do you ever
drop the jargon, Karen?

246
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:48,548
Excuse me?

247
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,682
I mean, we've worked together

248
00:15:49,684 --> 00:15:51,283
for several years now.

249
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:54,054
I'd even call you my favorite
code enforcement auditor.

250
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:57,355
You just stop that right now.

251
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:58,390
Stop what?

252
00:15:58,392 --> 00:15:59,761
The bullshit flattery.

253
00:16:00,695 --> 00:16:02,695
Do you think I like you, Dallas?

254
00:16:02,697 --> 00:16:05,130
Do you think we're friends?

255
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,131
Yeah.

256
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,867
I don't like you.

257
00:16:07,869 --> 00:16:10,670
I've never liked your face,

258
00:16:10,672 --> 00:16:14,072
there's just too much
hair going on there.

259
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:17,108
And I don't know if you're
trying to harass me right now,

260
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,911
but I don't appreciate it.

261
00:16:18,913 --> 00:16:22,247
I have a very sexy man
at home waiting for me

262
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:25,687
just so you know and you do
not talk to women like that.

263
00:16:26,621 --> 00:16:28,053
I see.

264
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:30,823
Well, there it is,
the beer station,

265
00:16:30,825 --> 00:16:32,694
the same as any
event would have,

266
00:16:33,828 --> 00:16:38,497
set up for beer
tasting, a few taps,

267
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:42,133
also, license and permitted

268
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:45,605
between local brewers
and us graciously.

269
00:16:45,607 --> 00:16:48,440
And you want me to
let you experiment?

270
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:50,810
Just 24, maybe 48 hours.

271
00:16:50,812 --> 00:16:54,212
Let us get through our events,
grow up some new business.

272
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:57,683
I promise, everything will
be in place after that.

273
00:16:57,685 --> 00:16:59,417
You can leave me with
your recommendations

274
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,455
and I'll have everything
that you require.

275
00:17:02,624 --> 00:17:03,856
The only thing that
I'm gonna recommend

276
00:17:03,858 --> 00:17:06,424
is that you get a job elsewhere

277
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:11,096
and I will never, ever
recommend you for anything,

278
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:14,067
anything, not even washing
dishes, you can't even do that.

279
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:17,135
What if I offer
you a free unlimited flight

280
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:20,372
for tomorrow night,
everything on the house?

281
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:22,008
You see how hard
we're working here.

282
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:27,015
Are you trying to bribe
a code enforcement officer?

283
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:29,984
No, ma'am,
not this business, no.

284
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:32,585
I can't believe this.

285
00:17:32,587 --> 00:17:35,222
I am going to call my
supervisor right now, this is,

286
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:40,893
I have never been so
degraded before in my life.

287
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:44,429
You do not bribe a
compliance officer.

288
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:46,131
It's just a misunderstanding.

289
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:48,333
Let's just forget the
whole thing, shall we?

290
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:50,002
I can get you arrested for this.

291
00:17:50,004 --> 00:17:50,836
No, that's not necessary.

292
00:17:50,838 --> 00:17:52,237
This is a felony.

293
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,471
This is a felony.

294
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:56,542
I will have your ass
on a stick right now.

295
00:17:56,544 --> 00:17:59,712
Oh, we'll do better next time.

296
00:17:59,714 --> 00:18:01,747
Oh, there won't be a next time.

297
00:18:01,749 --> 00:18:06,284
And if you continue to do this
event, I will shut you down.

298
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:07,218
Oh please.

299
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,821
Now I have to go inside

300
00:18:08,823 --> 00:18:10,957
and write you up
for more infractions

301
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:13,693
because this establishment
is so shitty.

302
00:18:13,695 --> 00:18:15,761
By the time I'm done
with you, Dallas,

303
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:18,129
you won't even be able to
work for your own mother.

304
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:21,035
Ah, thank you, thank you.

305
00:18:26,641 --> 00:18:31,109
Troy, I've gone over all
of this before with you

306
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,812
many times.

307
00:18:32,814 --> 00:18:34,346
I just need a full list

308
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:38,350
of every wine that you intend
to procure here for the month,

309
00:18:38,352 --> 00:18:39,284
where they come from,

310
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:40,786
where they originated from,

311
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:43,490
where all these
supplies are from.

312
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:45,659
Okay, I have it.

313
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:55,334
Somewhere.

314
00:18:56,804 --> 00:18:58,106
What are those?

315
00:18:59,507 --> 00:19:01,507
Oh, that's the Amityville one.

316
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:02,440
What?

317
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:03,743
I'm hosting a party for that.

318
00:19:03,745 --> 00:19:04,745
You can come if you want.

319
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,279
Big words, use your
big words, Troy.

320
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:10,482
It's a being commissioned
as a sales incentive

321
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,518
to allure intrigue.

322
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,587
And where is this party?

323
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:15,521
Oh, it's in my house.

324
00:19:15,523 --> 00:19:17,690
I got the best house for it.

325
00:19:17,692 --> 00:19:19,058
I built this tiki
bar in the back

326
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,394
and I hand sanded the deck.

327
00:19:23,064 --> 00:19:24,164
And a permit?

328
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:27,900
Oh, told my neighbors I
wouldn't be loud after 10.

329
00:19:27,902 --> 00:19:29,902
Troy, you know it's unethical

330
00:19:29,904 --> 00:19:33,171
to throw work events at
your house for the winery.

331
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:38,110
Okay, the wine is not licensed
to be in a private residence.

332
00:19:38,112 --> 00:19:40,478
No one asked me to
read anything, Karen.

333
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,750
It's not a test, it's
an exclusive event.

334
00:19:43,885 --> 00:19:45,851
Listen Troy,
everything is a test.

335
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:48,253
I need you to log all
of your supplies for me

336
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:49,387
so that I can put them here.

337
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:51,857
Can you please go do your job?

338
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:55,493
Sure but I was
go gonna invite you

339
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:56,762
and if you keep
pressuring me anymore,

340
00:19:56,764 --> 00:19:58,798
I just don't think I
can have you there.

341
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,666
Troy, you have to invite me

342
00:20:00,668 --> 00:20:02,369
because I have to
log everything.

343
00:20:04,172 --> 00:20:05,172
Thank you.

344
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:08,607
Well, if he's off the books,

345
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:11,813
then I guess I should
be off the books, too.

346
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:23,254
I cannot wait for
five o'clock to come.

347
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:25,124
You have no idea.

348
00:20:25,126 --> 00:20:28,728
Dallas and Hank are
going to be so sad

349
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,897
when I walk in there and
just shut it all down,

350
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:33,901
and that little bus boy, Troy.

351
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:37,268
You should have seen his
face, he was all excited.

352
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,372
He was all like, oh,
I made this party.

353
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:42,275
It's gonna be amazing though.

354
00:20:44,145 --> 00:20:46,912
I have really waited
for this all of my life.

355
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:50,883
It will be the
performance of a lifetime.

356
00:20:50,885 --> 00:20:52,184
I'm gonna see tears.

357
00:20:52,186 --> 00:20:53,786
They are gonna start crying.

358
00:20:53,788 --> 00:20:56,387
It's just, I might even film it.

359
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:58,891
I think I'm gonna set a camera
up and film the whole thing

360
00:20:58,893 --> 00:21:02,327
because it's just something
that I want to remember forever.

361
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:03,929
Yeah, it's gonna be a memory.

362
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:05,396
It's gonna be a memory,
it's gonna be great.

363
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:06,799
I just can't wait.

364
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:07,835
I just can't wait.

365
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:11,203
Ugh, hold on a second.

366
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:14,372
Who is it?

367
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:15,306
Mrs. Hargrave.

368
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:16,374
Stupid neighbor,

369
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:18,210
I don't know what she wants.

370
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:22,347
We need to talk seriously.

371
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:24,315
I did not invite you in here.

372
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:26,685
Yeah, well you
harassing my children,

373
00:21:26,687 --> 00:21:28,154
running my dog out of town,

374
00:21:28,156 --> 00:21:29,955
I think we need to talk
seriously about this.

375
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:33,391
First of all, your dog
has destroyed my garden.

376
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:36,028
I would like a check
for all of my flowers

377
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,930
that he has pissed and shit on.

378
00:21:37,932 --> 00:21:39,364
If you were a
decent human being,

379
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:41,066
you would at least
pick that shit up.

380
00:21:41,068 --> 00:21:43,769
Your flowers are more
important than my children's lives?

381
00:21:43,771 --> 00:21:44,837
Seriously?

382
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:46,005
Some people work.

383
00:21:46,007 --> 00:21:47,606
I had to go to work.

384
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:49,307
They were standing by my car.

385
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:51,409
I don't know if you're
purposely telling

386
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:54,379
these little monsters
of yours to harass me,

387
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:57,116
but I cannot take it any longer.

388
00:21:57,118 --> 00:21:59,084
Control your kids.

389
00:21:59,086 --> 00:22:00,619
And you're talking
about harassment?

390
00:22:00,621 --> 00:22:02,121
When you've got
your little lackeys

391
00:22:02,123 --> 00:22:05,323
coming around my backyard
spying on me, taking photos.

392
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:07,458
What, you gonna send
some emails to the HOA,

393
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,994
try to run me out of town?

394
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:10,062
I'd like to see you try.

395
00:22:10,064 --> 00:22:11,396
You are trying to seduce them

396
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:13,464
by taking all of
your clothes off.

397
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:15,034
I don't know where you grew up,

398
00:22:15,036 --> 00:22:18,537
but you are seriously
destroying our neighborhood.

399
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:20,239
Put some fucking clothes on.

400
00:22:20,241 --> 00:22:23,441
Maybe you should get a
job like most people have,

401
00:22:23,443 --> 00:22:24,844
okay, not just go around

402
00:22:24,846 --> 00:22:27,279
and fuck all of the men in town.

403
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:29,347
You're trying to
run me out of town?

404
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:32,651
I'd rather see your rotting
corpse before that happens.

405
00:22:32,653 --> 00:22:35,020
All right, well, you
know what, Mrs. Hargrave?

406
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:37,792
Why don't you just go have
a great day and fuck off?

407
00:22:38,893 --> 00:22:39,725
Fine.

408
00:22:39,727 --> 00:22:40,727
Cunt!

409
00:22:43,064 --> 00:22:44,230
Never been to San Francisco.

410
00:22:44,232 --> 00:22:45,731
Why would she even have that?

411
00:22:45,733 --> 00:22:49,270
It's like one girl and 50 cups,
that's gonna be the sequel.

412
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,306
Kevin?

413
00:22:54,308 --> 00:22:55,274
Yes, what? Hi.

414
00:22:55,276 --> 00:22:56,542
What are you doing here?

415
00:22:56,544 --> 00:22:57,576
I thought you needed
me to come over here

416
00:22:57,578 --> 00:22:59,712
and pick up the dry cleaning.

417
00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:01,347
No, not today, okay?

418
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:03,315
I have a lot of stuff going on

419
00:23:03,317 --> 00:23:06,518
and you can't just come into
my house without asking.

420
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,520
Okay.

421
00:23:08,189 --> 00:23:10,789
So violation?

422
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:13,491
Yeah, it's a
violation of my privacy.

423
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:14,960
What's a violation?

424
00:23:14,962 --> 00:23:18,364
A violation is when you enter
my house and I am not here.

425
00:23:18,366 --> 00:23:20,599
What if I was with someone else?

426
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:23,035
Ooh, like another girl?

427
00:23:23,037 --> 00:23:24,503
No, you child.

428
00:23:24,505 --> 00:23:26,705
You're such a child.

429
00:23:26,707 --> 00:23:27,640
Did you?

430
00:23:27,642 --> 00:23:29,108
Listen, I thought that maybe

431
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,043
after I finished doing whatever
chores you needed me to do,

432
00:23:31,045 --> 00:23:33,045
we could hang out and
like here, this wine,

433
00:23:33,047 --> 00:23:35,014
maybe we could drink
some of this wine

434
00:23:35,016 --> 00:23:36,515
and you know watch a movie

435
00:23:36,517 --> 00:23:40,185
and hang out afterward.
- No, this is my wine, okay?

436
00:23:40,187 --> 00:23:42,121
I have a very
important day tomorrow.

437
00:23:42,123 --> 00:23:44,890
At five o'clock, I am going
to shut down the winery

438
00:23:44,892 --> 00:23:46,926
and then I will get a promotion.

439
00:23:46,928 --> 00:23:48,896
All right, do you
know what that means?

440
00:23:49,797 --> 00:23:51,330
No.

441
00:23:51,332 --> 00:23:53,565
I know you didn't finish
high school, Kevin, okay,

442
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:56,402
but a promotion means
I make more money.

443
00:23:56,404 --> 00:24:00,105
Then, I can buy a nicer
house and get a nicer car

444
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:01,640
and move out of
this shitty place

445
00:24:01,642 --> 00:24:03,976
with all these shitty people.

446
00:24:03,978 --> 00:24:05,711
Well, you know,
maybe to prepare,

447
00:24:05,713 --> 00:24:07,613
maybe you should get
some rest and you know,

448
00:24:07,615 --> 00:24:09,784
two people make a
nap a lot better.

449
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:12,483
No, no, no, no, Kevin,

450
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:13,953
I just need to have
some alone time,

451
00:24:13,955 --> 00:24:17,323
I will power nap and I will
have a great time okay?

452
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:18,157
Okay.

453
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,658
Well, all right, fine.

454
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,626
You know what?

455
00:24:20,628 --> 00:24:22,061
Don't you need to go home

456
00:24:22,063 --> 00:24:24,263
and get your mom to sign
that permission slip for you?

457
00:24:24,265 --> 00:24:25,397
Aright, well this has been fun.

458
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:26,966
Yeah, see leave.

459
00:24:26,968 --> 00:24:28,466
That's what I'm gonna do.

460
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:31,203
You need to move out of
your mom's house, okay?

461
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:33,471
It's not cool that you
live in her basement.

462
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:36,077
It's not cool, not cool, Kevin.

463
00:24:37,645 --> 00:24:41,048
Ugh, just me and you tonight.

464
00:26:08,269 --> 00:26:09,603
Is this a dream?

465
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:13,205
This dream is offensive.

466
00:26:13,207 --> 00:26:16,844
Cover up, stop being naked.

467
00:26:28,689 --> 00:26:30,523
Is this a dream?

468
00:26:30,525 --> 00:26:31,890
I'm dreaming.

469
00:26:31,892 --> 00:26:34,326
You're offensive.

470
00:26:34,328 --> 00:26:36,363
Put some clothes on.

471
00:26:38,365 --> 00:26:39,365
Stop.

472
00:26:49,511 --> 00:26:53,080
That's disgusting, don't
do that on my floor.

473
00:27:19,373 --> 00:27:21,240
No, I did not invite
you in my house.

474
00:27:21,242 --> 00:27:24,409
Kevin, did you invite
one of your sluts in?

475
00:27:24,411 --> 00:27:26,211
Get, no, off of my bed.

476
00:27:26,213 --> 00:27:28,213
Don't touch me,
don't you touch me.

477
00:27:28,215 --> 00:27:29,215
No, no!

478
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:32,519
No, no.

479
00:27:32,521 --> 00:27:33,752
Look, I don't like women.

480
00:27:33,754 --> 00:27:35,821
I don't know what
Kevin told you,

481
00:27:35,823 --> 00:27:38,657
but I am not into women
and this is not okay.

482
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:39,659
Kevin!

483
00:27:40,828 --> 00:27:42,995
No, no, don't you get on top.

484
00:27:42,997 --> 00:27:44,096
That's not okay,
this is not okay.

485
00:27:44,098 --> 00:27:45,831
Kevin!

486
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:50,271
Kevin, Kevin, Kevin, oh, get
off of me, get off of me.

487
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:54,806
I don't want this right now.

488
00:27:54,808 --> 00:27:56,108
This is a bad dream.

489
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,846
Wake up, Karen,
wake up, wake up!

490
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,854
I don't know what's
going on, Mr. Snuggles.

491
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:10,724
What happened last night?

492
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:13,394
Who was here?

493
00:28:18,032 --> 00:28:20,301
I can't, I can't, I can't.

494
00:28:28,242 --> 00:28:29,243
I look okay.

495
00:28:31,045 --> 00:28:32,246
I just don't feel right.

496
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:39,918
Karen?

497
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,920
Who's talking?

498
00:29:08,949 --> 00:29:09,949
Who is it?

499
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:13,119
Excuse me?

500
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:16,822
My name is Barnaby.

501
00:29:16,824 --> 00:29:18,492
Did you enjoy the wine?

502
00:29:19,527 --> 00:29:20,527
What?

503
00:29:21,663 --> 00:29:25,199
Your belly is big and pregnant

504
00:29:26,066 --> 00:29:29,101
from the juices of my grapes.

505
00:29:29,103 --> 00:29:31,903
That is sexual harassment
and I don't have to take it.

506
00:29:31,905 --> 00:29:34,373
If you don't get outta here
right now, I'm calling the cops.

507
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:35,710
I'm gonna call them right now.

508
00:29:37,144 --> 00:29:38,647
You have been chosen.

509
00:29:40,414 --> 00:29:42,848
You have been chosen
for the uprising.

510
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:45,851
Look I don't know whatever
Bible thing you're selling,

511
00:29:45,853 --> 00:29:47,419
but I am not religious

512
00:29:47,421 --> 00:29:51,292
and it is illegal for you
to sell your theories on me.

513
00:29:53,193 --> 00:29:57,097
You will sign this
because you're mine, bitch.

514
00:30:02,737 --> 00:30:05,837
The powers unleashed
onto you from my wine

515
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:10,510
will be transformed to
everyone you contact

516
00:30:10,512 --> 00:30:13,513
and you will be
giving them my wine.

517
00:30:13,515 --> 00:30:16,016
Now sign this contract, bitch.

518
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,420
Okay.

519
00:30:21,523 --> 00:30:25,359
I am presenting you
with my bony thumb.

520
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,916
Man Gerald, I cannot believe it.

521
00:30:50,918 --> 00:30:52,552
Everything that I
wanted is happening.

522
00:30:52,554 --> 00:30:56,689
We are having beer tasting,
beer flights here at the winery.

523
00:30:56,691 --> 00:30:58,190
Would you ever thought a winery

524
00:30:58,192 --> 00:31:00,459
would ever be able
to have beer flights?

525
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:01,360
This is awesome.

526
00:31:01,362 --> 00:31:02,762
I am so thrilled.

527
00:31:02,764 --> 00:31:03,995
I know.

528
00:31:03,997 --> 00:31:04,930
How many years have
I been telling you

529
00:31:04,932 --> 00:31:06,164
that we've gotta have beer here?

530
00:31:06,166 --> 00:31:06,965
We've both been
talking about it.

531
00:31:06,967 --> 00:31:08,433
We're beer aficionados

532
00:31:08,435 --> 00:31:11,303
and we're finally getting
our chance to have beer here.

533
00:31:11,305 --> 00:31:12,538
Absolutely.

534
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,873
I just hope we get a
lot more chicks coming

535
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:16,341
as a result of this event.

536
00:31:16,343 --> 00:31:17,275
You know what?

537
00:31:17,277 --> 00:31:18,578
Everybody cool drinks beer.

538
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,112
We are gonna have so
many cool chicks here.

539
00:31:20,114 --> 00:31:21,814
We are gonna be the cool guys.

540
00:31:21,816 --> 00:31:24,116
You know, I have a
thing for Latina girls,

541
00:31:24,118 --> 00:31:25,384
but what about you?

542
00:31:25,386 --> 00:31:26,819
Do you have a type, a
favorite type of girl?

543
00:31:26,821 --> 00:31:29,589
Of course, I prefer the Asians,

544
00:31:29,591 --> 00:31:30,523
gotta love 'em.
- The Asians?

545
00:31:30,525 --> 00:31:31,758
I like the Asian girls, too,

546
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,024
but so here's what
we're gonna do.

547
00:31:33,026 --> 00:31:34,660
Any girls that come in
here that are Latinas,

548
00:31:34,662 --> 00:31:37,830
they come to me, all the
Asians go straight to you.

549
00:31:37,832 --> 00:31:38,930
We're each other's wing men.

550
00:31:38,932 --> 00:31:40,365
We'll be helping each other out.

551
00:31:40,367 --> 00:31:43,335
We'll be getting each other
laid in our beer area.

552
00:31:43,337 --> 00:31:45,270
That is awesome, no competition.

553
00:31:45,272 --> 00:31:46,806
We don't have to
have anybody else here.

554
00:31:46,808 --> 00:31:47,707
No one else has to come here.

555
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:49,474
This is our area.

556
00:31:49,476 --> 00:31:51,878
We own this joint,
we own this joint.

557
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,111
You know, the only thing is

558
00:31:53,113 --> 00:31:54,379
I just hope people
like our beer flights,

559
00:31:54,381 --> 00:31:56,415
'cause let me tell you,
if they don't like it,

560
00:31:56,417 --> 00:31:57,916
I'm gonna be really let down.

561
00:31:57,918 --> 00:32:00,152
I mean we've been working
a long time on these.

562
00:32:00,154 --> 00:32:01,687
I'm just like so excited
about this whole thing.

563
00:32:01,689 --> 00:32:03,188
I just cannot believe it.

564
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:05,290
I'm just really hoping that
they like our beer flight.

565
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:07,593
That's all that matters is
'cause they know we picked it.

566
00:32:07,595 --> 00:32:10,095
That's the thing, I'm gonna
hate it if they don't like.

567
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:11,329
Listen, they're gonna love it.

568
00:32:11,331 --> 00:32:12,732
There's definitely
gonna be a huge hit.

569
00:32:12,734 --> 00:32:13,666
Don't worry about it.

570
00:32:13,668 --> 00:32:15,235
All right, I can't wait.

571
00:32:16,403 --> 00:32:19,404
Now I know you need
to change things up,

572
00:32:19,406 --> 00:32:21,106
business is slow,

573
00:32:21,108 --> 00:32:26,013
but beer tasting, isn't that
like a college kid thing?

574
00:32:27,981 --> 00:32:30,550
I wouldn't know, Annie,
I never went to college.

575
00:32:30,552 --> 00:32:33,287
Oh well you're doing all right.

576
00:32:34,254 --> 00:32:36,221
You're doing good for yourself.

577
00:32:36,223 --> 00:32:38,356
You've mastered that cork pull.

578
00:32:38,358 --> 00:32:40,227
It's just so dreamy, mm hmm.

579
00:32:43,964 --> 00:32:45,867
Okay, let's see here.

580
00:33:14,629 --> 00:33:17,030
Sometimes you gotta show
you who boss, you know,

581
00:33:17,998 --> 00:33:20,332
put some real strength into it.

582
00:33:25,372 --> 00:33:27,207
See, no problem, wala.

583
00:33:30,812 --> 00:33:31,644
Yeah?

584
00:33:31,646 --> 00:33:32,646
Yes, please.

585
00:33:34,782 --> 00:33:37,783
You certainly are
my favorite server

586
00:33:37,785 --> 00:33:38,951
and I'm just really
rooting for you all

587
00:33:38,953 --> 00:33:39,988
to get back on track.

588
00:33:42,055 --> 00:33:44,626
This place is like home to me.

589
00:33:47,962 --> 00:33:50,061
I want to thank you
for the conversation

590
00:33:50,063 --> 00:33:54,067
and of course this wine
coursing through my veins.

591
00:33:55,503 --> 00:33:56,503
It's my pleasure.

592
00:33:58,773 --> 00:34:02,040
Now, when she comes in,
let me talk to her first.

593
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:05,212
I'll take her in the back and
go through it with her there.

594
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,914
We don't want to have a scene.

595
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:09,982
I just need to get her
away from everyone.

596
00:34:09,984 --> 00:34:12,585
Yeah, what do you think
she's gonna try to pull?

597
00:34:12,587 --> 00:34:14,587
Probably something
to do with sanitation

598
00:34:14,589 --> 00:34:17,389
or a structure
issue, I don't know,

599
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:19,659
but whatever it is, I'll give
her a temporary clearance

600
00:34:19,661 --> 00:34:20,895
my cousin typed up

601
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:23,629
and get her off our
backs until tomorrow.

602
00:34:23,631 --> 00:34:25,031
Then, we'll go through it.

603
00:34:25,033 --> 00:34:26,599
I just need to get
her to fuck off

604
00:34:26,601 --> 00:34:28,002
till we get this event done.

605
00:34:29,169 --> 00:34:31,136
Great, what about
the brand launch?

606
00:34:31,138 --> 00:34:32,538
What about it?

607
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,105
You think she has
anything going on with that?

608
00:34:34,107 --> 00:34:36,107
Because Troy said that
she was acting weird

609
00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:37,375
and that her pigeon face

610
00:34:37,377 --> 00:34:39,779
might try to throw a
wrench in that too.

611
00:34:39,781 --> 00:34:41,013
If she does try anything,

612
00:34:41,015 --> 00:34:42,949
we have to keep our cool.

613
00:34:42,951 --> 00:34:44,482
This Amityville owner

614
00:34:44,484 --> 00:34:47,019
is putting a hell of a lot
of money into renovations

615
00:34:47,021 --> 00:34:49,154
and we have to keep him happy.

616
00:34:49,156 --> 00:34:50,656
Right, right.

617
00:34:50,658 --> 00:34:53,025
Hey, Troy said one of the
bottles was missing too.

618
00:34:53,027 --> 00:34:54,994
You don't think she
took it, do you?

619
00:34:54,996 --> 00:34:56,529
I sure wish she did.

620
00:34:56,531 --> 00:34:59,266
I'd love to see her unhappy
ass drink a bottle or two.

621
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:01,834
Hell, I'd give her a whole case

622
00:35:01,836 --> 00:35:03,970
if it meant her being
less of a nasty bitch.

623
00:35:03,972 --> 00:35:05,203
Right?

624
00:35:05,205 --> 00:35:06,672
Man, I would love
to see her drunk

625
00:35:06,674 --> 00:35:09,107
and just drop that stiff
uppity know-it-all routine,

626
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:10,610
you know what I'm saying?

627
00:35:10,612 --> 00:35:12,914
Like do you think she's
ever been fun in her life?

628
00:35:13,848 --> 00:35:15,213
All that matters right now

629
00:35:15,215 --> 00:35:16,749
is she is the only thing

630
00:35:16,751 --> 00:35:18,517
that stands between
us digging ourselves

631
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:19,988
out of a deep dark hole,

632
00:35:21,221 --> 00:35:24,857
whatever it takes, give
her whatever it takes.

633
00:35:24,859 --> 00:35:27,061
True, I'm on board,
whatever it takes.

634
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:32,599
My manager.

635
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:37,302
I need to talk to a manager.

636
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:40,474
Manager, I need to
talk to a manager.

637
00:35:41,976 --> 00:35:45,680
I want to talk to the supervisor's
supervisor's supervisor.

638
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:51,085
No, that fork is dirty.

639
00:35:51,953 --> 00:35:54,520
That's dirty, there's hair.

640
00:35:54,522 --> 00:35:55,657
I want a refund.

641
00:35:56,691 --> 00:35:59,725
I won't take no for an answer.

642
00:35:59,727 --> 00:36:00,995
Give me back my money.

643
00:36:02,664 --> 00:36:05,965
No, no, no, there's a bug.

644
00:36:05,967 --> 00:36:09,669
No, no, no, no,

645
00:36:09,671 --> 00:36:13,005
I want to speak to a supervisor.

646
00:36:13,007 --> 00:36:18,012
Please, the supervisor, your
supervisor's supervisor.

647
00:36:19,781 --> 00:36:20,781
No!

648
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:43,870
Hello?

649
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:46,139
Hello?

650
00:36:46,908 --> 00:36:47,908
Hello, ma'am.

651
00:36:49,644 --> 00:36:53,478
My name is Bjorn and
I have very exciting

652
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,847
news to share with you

653
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:57,550
about phone service
options in your area.

654
00:36:57,552 --> 00:36:59,317
Did I invite you in my house?

655
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:01,654
'Cause I don't remember
inviting you inside.

656
00:37:01,656 --> 00:37:03,789
If you would give me
just a moment of your time,

657
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:08,160
I will tell you about great
discounts that my company offers

658
00:37:08,162 --> 00:37:11,130
that will save you on
ways that you can change

659
00:37:11,132 --> 00:37:13,099
the way you reach out and
touch those around you.

660
00:37:13,101 --> 00:37:15,069
I don't want anyone touching me.

661
00:37:16,269 --> 00:37:18,971
How did you get my information?

662
00:37:18,973 --> 00:37:20,238
Well, we have a list.

663
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,909
I do not deserve
to be on the list.

664
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:25,745
Where is your supervisor?

665
00:37:25,747 --> 00:37:27,513
Well, my
supervisor's at the office,

666
00:37:27,515 --> 00:37:28,914
but if you give
me just a moment,

667
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:31,684
I promise you I can
save you a lot of money.

668
00:37:31,686 --> 00:37:33,619
All right, you're
gonna save me money?

669
00:37:33,621 --> 00:37:35,320
Yeah, yeah, can I?

670
00:37:35,322 --> 00:37:36,655
Okay, great, let me show you

671
00:37:36,657 --> 00:37:37,823
the plans.
- Let me show you my phones.

672
00:37:37,825 --> 00:37:39,324
Okay, let's do it.

673
00:37:39,326 --> 00:37:41,326
I'll show you my plans
and we'll talk about it.

674
00:37:41,328 --> 00:37:43,229
I think you're really
gonna like this.

675
00:37:43,231 --> 00:37:44,231
I know I will.

676
00:37:49,771 --> 00:37:51,637
You behave, Ivan.

677
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:53,706
I had three older
brothers growing up

678
00:37:53,708 --> 00:37:56,976
and I whooped their asses
on several occasions.

679
00:37:56,978 --> 00:37:58,713
You don't want to
tangle with me?

680
00:37:59,881 --> 00:38:02,181
Ouch, looks like
they helped make you

681
00:38:02,183 --> 00:38:03,516
quite the badass though.

682
00:38:03,518 --> 00:38:04,750
That they did.

683
00:38:04,752 --> 00:38:06,554
They made me strong,
they made me mean,

684
00:38:07,722 --> 00:38:08,956
but they made me durable.

685
00:38:10,158 --> 00:38:12,658
Well, what would make
you a little friendlier?

686
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,097
Oh, well buy me another
round and let's find out.

687
00:38:18,266 --> 00:38:20,668
I hear she's a fine
dancer, very smooth.

688
00:38:22,103 --> 00:38:24,870
Spirits definitely have
something to do with it.

689
00:38:24,872 --> 00:38:26,105
You mean like ghosts?

690
00:38:26,107 --> 00:38:30,543
Like possession, woo.

691
00:38:30,545 --> 00:38:33,480
I bet you could get seriously
haunted drinking that wine.

692
00:38:35,183 --> 00:38:37,583
Well, not until tomorrow night.

693
00:38:37,585 --> 00:38:39,587
No spooky stuff until
after the party.

694
00:38:40,521 --> 00:38:41,821
Are you coming?

695
00:38:41,823 --> 00:38:44,455
Not me, I can't make it though.

696
00:38:44,457 --> 00:38:46,525
Oh, I was gonna ask
you to be my date.

697
00:38:46,527 --> 00:38:48,763
Aw, and I would have
to politely decline.

698
00:38:49,897 --> 00:38:51,597
I know it's gonna be a scream.

699
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,600
Can't wait to hear all
about it next time I'm in.

700
00:38:54,602 --> 00:38:56,434
You want us to
save you a sample?

701
00:38:56,436 --> 00:38:58,003
Yes, of course.

702
00:38:58,005 --> 00:38:59,905
You know I've been
dying to try it,

703
00:38:59,907 --> 00:39:02,109
that with all the
build up of the lore.

704
00:39:03,511 --> 00:39:08,013
Fancy bottles, campfire
tales, overpriced grape juice.

705
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:11,750
Speaking of that, I want to
go support the beer tasting.

706
00:39:11,752 --> 00:39:13,087
I'll see you guys in a bit.

707
00:39:15,623 --> 00:39:19,158
Ew, why would you
want to do that?

708
00:39:33,841 --> 00:39:35,274
So many things to do,

709
00:39:35,276 --> 00:39:36,777
I can't do it all.

710
00:39:38,813 --> 00:39:40,846
Kick the dog,

711
00:39:40,848 --> 00:39:43,684
I didn't feed the cat,
it's reported the videos,

712
00:39:44,685 --> 00:39:46,419
become the head of the HOA.

713
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,455
It's not fair,

714
00:39:50,457 --> 00:39:53,694
I didn't get to yell
at my gardeners today.

715
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:57,930
Ruin wine tasting at 5:00 PM.

716
00:39:57,932 --> 00:40:01,700
Shut them down, I
can still do that.

717
00:40:01,702 --> 00:40:02,937
I'm gonna go do that.

718
00:40:04,138 --> 00:40:05,070
I'm gonna go ruin
that wine tasting

719
00:40:05,072 --> 00:40:07,008
if it's the last thing I do.

720
00:40:13,581 --> 00:40:14,680
Shit son.

721
00:40:29,363 --> 00:40:30,363
God damn.

722
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,050
His loss, holds a hole.

723
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,853
Bartender, you have
any whisky back there?

724
00:40:54,522 --> 00:40:56,891
I have some wine
with some birds on it.

725
00:40:58,326 --> 00:41:00,993
Come on now, man, give
me that whole bottle, Fred.

726
00:41:00,995 --> 00:41:02,594
How long we known each other?

727
00:41:02,596 --> 00:41:03,756
This is how you treat me now?

728
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:06,599
Ladies.

729
00:41:14,474 --> 00:41:16,408
Oh, he's so funny.

730
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:18,577
Is that your boyfriend?

731
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:19,579
Spirit.

732
00:41:21,282 --> 00:41:22,616
Oh, a groupie?

733
00:41:23,951 --> 00:41:25,651
Same thing.

734
00:41:25,653 --> 00:41:27,753
That's a romantic
approach, I suppose.

735
00:41:27,755 --> 00:41:31,623
Well.

736
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:32,524
I like it.

737
00:41:32,526 --> 00:41:34,593
Shut up, Ivan.

738
00:41:34,595 --> 00:41:36,597
Ooh, I like that, too.

739
00:41:41,936 --> 00:41:44,670
Yeah, ride into your hot 102.

740
00:41:44,672 --> 00:41:49,274
That's right, he's a hot
boy, she's a hot girl,

741
00:41:49,276 --> 00:41:51,545
but she's hot boy
today, aren't you, baby?

742
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,712
Right.

743
00:41:53,714 --> 00:41:55,214
Oh, that's right,

744
00:41:55,216 --> 00:41:58,484
we're down here at the winery
two days a week, friends,

745
00:41:58,486 --> 00:42:00,886
two days a week.

746
00:42:00,888 --> 00:42:03,958
Come on down and
see how all of this.

747
00:42:06,427 --> 00:42:08,494
Oh, listen, listen,

748
00:42:08,496 --> 00:42:10,996
not what you said
last night, baby.

749
00:42:10,998 --> 00:42:13,332
Anyway, as I was saying before,

750
00:42:13,334 --> 00:42:15,467
you do that now, oh yeah.

751
00:42:15,469 --> 00:42:17,872
How 'bout some of this, guys?

752
00:42:23,444 --> 00:42:26,812
Yeah, you just saw
this old man twerk

753
00:42:26,814 --> 00:42:27,679
and you liked it.

754
00:42:27,681 --> 00:42:29,448
You saw it, you saw,

755
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:31,784
saw this old man twerk

756
00:42:31,786 --> 00:42:32,920
and it mesmerized you.

757
00:42:34,088 --> 00:42:35,923
It's okay, I do that.

758
00:42:40,361 --> 00:42:41,361
Mic drop.

759
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:45,330
What do you recommend?

760
00:42:45,332 --> 00:42:48,133
Oh, well what do you like?

761
00:42:48,135 --> 00:42:52,204
Well, I usually just drink
whatever or go buy the label.

762
00:42:52,206 --> 00:42:56,141
Well, are you a red girl or
do you like something lighter?

763
00:42:56,143 --> 00:42:58,644
Full bodied or fruity?

764
00:42:58,646 --> 00:43:00,513
What is that one?

765
00:43:00,515 --> 00:43:05,486
Oh, that one seems to
be the conversation piece

766
00:43:06,087 --> 00:43:07,319
of the evening.

767
00:43:07,321 --> 00:43:09,190
Well, then my job is well done.

768
00:43:10,624 --> 00:43:13,025
Like a chewy steak, dear.

769
00:43:13,027 --> 00:43:14,027
What is it?

770
00:43:15,096 --> 00:43:18,097
Well, it's a red, I believe,

771
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:20,766
although I've never
tasted it personally.

772
00:43:20,768 --> 00:43:23,802
Talk is is that
it's hearty, thick

773
00:43:23,804 --> 00:43:25,070
and sticks to one

774
00:43:25,072 --> 00:43:27,542
as if it almost becomes
one with your soul.

775
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:29,510
Is that good?

776
00:43:30,744 --> 00:43:33,414
It depends if you like to be
taken over by your beverage.

777
00:43:34,815 --> 00:43:37,082
Intoxication comes with
the territory, Annie.

778
00:43:37,084 --> 00:43:39,751
I'm not talking
about getting drunk.

779
00:43:39,753 --> 00:43:42,123
I'm talking about
body snatching.

780
00:43:43,824 --> 00:43:46,892
Kids want to blame their
bad behavior on alcohol,

781
00:43:46,894 --> 00:43:48,696
I'm just not advocating that.

782
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:53,465
Rumor has it that this
winery in Amityville

783
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:55,767
was built on a cursed location,

784
00:43:55,769 --> 00:43:59,771
lots of cult
activities, sacrifices,

785
00:43:59,773 --> 00:44:04,243
paranormal infestations and
murder, all in the soil,

786
00:44:04,245 --> 00:44:07,479
rooted where they
harvest the ingredients.

787
00:44:07,481 --> 00:44:10,951
You can taste the
damnation in every sip.

788
00:44:12,386 --> 00:44:15,489
Now that's definitely not
in the sales pitch I have.

789
00:44:17,291 --> 00:44:20,494
How do you know
this and can I try it?

790
00:44:21,962 --> 00:44:25,464
Because I've had my finger
on the pulse of that town

791
00:44:25,466 --> 00:44:28,033
and that winery in particular.

792
00:44:28,035 --> 00:44:33,040
I was here when the old man
brought it in and I adore wine.

793
00:44:34,441 --> 00:44:37,610
I'm always looking
for the what's what.

794
00:44:37,612 --> 00:44:41,650
But when I saw that old
man, I knew it was real.

795
00:44:42,883 --> 00:44:45,350
And that's why I
won't go to the party.

796
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:47,286
You're such a pooper, Annie.

797
00:44:47,288 --> 00:44:49,354
And what's your name again?

798
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:50,289
Bianca.

799
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:53,425
Bianca, you have to RSVP

800
00:44:53,427 --> 00:44:55,394
to the party for
the wine to try it.

801
00:44:55,396 --> 00:44:57,129
It's at my house tomorrow night,

802
00:44:57,131 --> 00:44:59,298
and it's not cursed
like Annie says,

803
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,799
but she is onto
something pretty spiffy

804
00:45:00,801 --> 00:45:02,901
with that horrifying
marketing approach.

805
00:45:02,903 --> 00:45:05,170
Hell, even I want to try it now.

806
00:45:05,172 --> 00:45:06,606
Thanks, Annie.

807
00:45:06,608 --> 00:45:10,309
Well, it could just
be a part of the allure,

808
00:45:10,311 --> 00:45:12,311
but I wouldn't chance it.

809
00:45:12,313 --> 00:45:13,615
Up to you, doll.

810
00:45:14,748 --> 00:45:16,817
Just trying to liven
up the evening,

811
00:45:18,152 --> 00:45:20,888
but there is something
otherworldly about that wine.

812
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:40,673
Karen, you made it in.

813
00:45:40,675 --> 00:45:43,842
I'm assuming this is for
business and not pleasure.

814
00:45:43,844 --> 00:45:46,648
You're not here to take me up
on the free flight, are you?

815
00:45:48,516 --> 00:45:50,282
Okay, I see.

816
00:45:50,284 --> 00:45:51,285
What's this?

817
00:46:00,794 --> 00:46:02,894
Okay, I see.

818
00:46:02,896 --> 00:46:04,465
Let's go talk about this, okay?

819
00:46:05,299 --> 00:46:06,299
Come on.

820
00:46:18,979 --> 00:46:21,480
So you're saying we can
have the brand launch party,

821
00:46:21,482 --> 00:46:22,883
but at a different location?

822
00:46:25,786 --> 00:46:29,555
So if we had the brand launch
party at this location,

823
00:46:29,557 --> 00:46:31,258
everything is in the clear?

824
00:46:33,227 --> 00:46:34,426
What are you talking about?

825
00:46:34,428 --> 00:46:36,596
My house has already
been approved.

826
00:46:36,598 --> 00:46:37,796
We have a gated
community and everything.

827
00:46:37,798 --> 00:46:40,399
I gave the guard the
list already, it's done.

828
00:46:40,401 --> 00:46:41,933
Troy, it's okay.

829
00:46:41,935 --> 00:46:45,470
Karen has just explained to
us that it's a zoning issue.

830
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:46,905
She's just here to make sure

831
00:46:46,907 --> 00:46:51,043
we have all the proper
documents and documentations

832
00:46:51,045 --> 00:46:54,248
for the jurisdiction
and all that.

833
00:46:56,685 --> 00:46:57,983
But I-

834
00:46:57,985 --> 00:47:00,952
Troy, just make sure
your station is stocked.

835
00:47:00,954 --> 00:47:03,155
Gerald made mention that
your wrestling accounts,

836
00:47:03,157 --> 00:47:06,126
he saw it might be off
a little bit tonight.

837
00:47:11,265 --> 00:47:12,464
I'm sorry about that,

838
00:47:12,466 --> 00:47:15,233
but he's very proud
of his position

839
00:47:15,235 --> 00:47:18,805
and this is a very
big deal to him.

840
00:47:18,807 --> 00:47:20,007
Thank you.

841
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:25,010
I'll go make some party
favors for the event tonight.

842
00:47:25,012 --> 00:47:28,380
Ooh, you ready to
dance, dancing queen?

843
00:47:28,382 --> 00:47:31,985
You know, I still
think that's a hard pass.

844
00:47:34,288 --> 00:47:35,220
But what about Howard?

845
00:47:35,222 --> 00:47:36,254
He's out there by himself.

846
00:47:36,256 --> 00:47:37,289
Look at him go.

847
00:47:37,291 --> 00:47:39,391
I mean, I'm really not good

848
00:47:39,393 --> 00:47:41,828
at being put on the spot, Ivan.

849
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:43,895
So maybe you should
just run along

850
00:47:43,897 --> 00:47:45,700
and I could end my
night peacefully.

851
00:47:55,175 --> 00:47:57,309
I just can't believe
she did that to me.

852
00:47:57,311 --> 00:47:58,711
Troy, I don't think Dallas
did it to you on purpose.

853
00:47:58,713 --> 00:47:59,911
You know how Karen is,

854
00:47:59,913 --> 00:48:01,446
she comes in here
and shakes things up.

855
00:48:01,448 --> 00:48:02,381
That's what she does.

856
00:48:02,383 --> 00:48:04,116
I don't have much in my life.

857
00:48:04,118 --> 00:48:06,351
Opening my cave to
bring others to it

858
00:48:06,353 --> 00:48:08,721
and business to our family
is everything to me.

859
00:48:08,723 --> 00:48:10,355
Why isn't that enough?

860
00:48:10,357 --> 00:48:11,356
You know, Troy, you
know what I think?

861
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:12,525
Let me tell you something.

862
00:48:12,527 --> 00:48:15,260
I think she's a massive,
massive alcoholic.

863
00:48:15,262 --> 00:48:16,629
And you know why she's
here all the time?

864
00:48:16,631 --> 00:48:18,363
'Cause she's here
to drink us dry.

865
00:48:18,365 --> 00:48:20,733
That's why she's here, she's
a wino, she loves wine.

866
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:23,402
She loves to come here
for the free screener wine

867
00:48:23,404 --> 00:48:25,571
and to shake things up
and get wine from us.

868
00:48:25,573 --> 00:48:28,106
That's why she's here, drunk.

869
00:48:28,108 --> 00:48:29,374
I just can't stand back

870
00:48:29,376 --> 00:48:31,376
and feel like she
got one under on me.

871
00:48:31,378 --> 00:48:34,079
It took me days to
sand that deck, Alex.

872
00:48:34,081 --> 00:48:35,914
You don't just sand
a deck for days

873
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:37,416
and let someone shit on it.

874
00:48:37,418 --> 00:48:39,384
Listen, listen, you
can't let this defeat you.

875
00:48:39,386 --> 00:48:41,587
You know Troy, you
are the party king.

876
00:48:41,589 --> 00:48:43,088
Everybody loves your parties.

877
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,222
We all talk about your parties.

878
00:48:44,224 --> 00:48:45,892
We love going to your parties.

879
00:48:45,894 --> 00:48:47,693
You are the king of the parties.

880
00:48:47,695 --> 00:48:48,960
Don't let this defeat you.

881
00:48:48,962 --> 00:48:50,797
There's gonna be way
more parties, Troy.

882
00:48:50,799 --> 00:48:52,431
This is not the end for you.

883
00:48:52,433 --> 00:48:53,833
Parties are in your future.

884
00:48:53,835 --> 00:48:56,569
I told you, party king.

885
00:48:56,571 --> 00:48:58,506
That's right, I'm the man.

886
00:49:00,007 --> 00:49:02,407
I have to defend my
property, my job.

887
00:49:02,409 --> 00:49:03,442
And your deck.

888
00:49:03,444 --> 00:49:06,581
My deck, my winery.

889
00:49:08,148 --> 00:49:09,651
Oh, it's so on.

890
00:49:14,722 --> 00:49:16,756
All right, Gerald, right?

891
00:49:16,758 --> 00:49:18,056
Right.

892
00:49:18,058 --> 00:49:19,759
I'm Moran, I'm the band manager.

893
00:49:19,761 --> 00:49:20,693
All right so I'm
gonna talk to you

894
00:49:20,695 --> 00:49:21,928
a little bit about payment.

895
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:23,395
All right so I'm
gonna take payment

896
00:49:23,397 --> 00:49:24,797
as soon as they start
the last song, all right?

897
00:49:24,799 --> 00:49:25,964
I gotta count it out,

898
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:27,365
I gotta make sure
that's in the increments

899
00:49:27,367 --> 00:49:28,601
that we discussed earlier.

900
00:49:28,603 --> 00:49:29,535
All right you know
what I'm saying?

901
00:49:29,537 --> 00:49:30,803
I'm not a fucking stripper

902
00:49:30,805 --> 00:49:32,971
so don't be giving
me too many ones.

903
00:49:32,973 --> 00:49:34,540
Let's see here,
now the house fee,

904
00:49:34,542 --> 00:49:37,275
we're gonna need to look
at cutting that, okay?

905
00:49:37,277 --> 00:49:39,545
You know, we're kind of
doing you a favor here

906
00:49:39,547 --> 00:49:41,213
and it seemed to be
really expensive,

907
00:49:41,215 --> 00:49:42,447
especially last minute

908
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:43,816
so if you could just
work with me on this.

909
00:49:43,818 --> 00:49:45,450
What do you think?

910
00:49:45,452 --> 00:49:48,119
I don't know anything
about that, man.

911
00:49:48,121 --> 00:49:50,690
I'm overdue as well.

912
00:49:50,692 --> 00:49:52,558
See, see, see, I'm
not the only one.

913
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,128
For my little trip to
the little girl's room.

914
00:49:58,465 --> 00:50:00,900
Okay, so she's
just being a, look,

915
00:50:00,902 --> 00:50:01,834
none of us getting is paid here.

916
00:50:01,836 --> 00:50:03,669
Have you gotten paid lady?

917
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:04,671
No comment.

918
00:50:05,874 --> 00:50:08,608
Okay, I would pay
her lots of money,

919
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:09,542
okay, you know what I'm saying,

920
00:50:09,544 --> 00:50:10,910
but I need to get paid money.

921
00:50:10,912 --> 00:50:12,745
I got people to pay, I
got band members to pay,

922
00:50:12,747 --> 00:50:14,279
you know what I'm
saying, I got shit to do.

923
00:50:14,281 --> 00:50:16,314
So what do you think
about that, huh?

924
00:50:16,316 --> 00:50:18,116
I don't know.

925
00:50:18,118 --> 00:50:19,384
All right, I'm gonna have
to find somebody around here

926
00:50:19,386 --> 00:50:20,906
that knows what the
hell they're doing.

927
00:50:24,391 --> 00:50:26,694
Hey Troy, the
ransom count is good.

928
00:50:28,663 --> 00:50:30,395
I cannot believe her.

929
00:50:30,397 --> 00:50:32,767
How could she just
tear me apart?

930
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:36,236
I can't let her
get away with this.

931
00:50:37,437 --> 00:50:38,472
You know what?

932
00:50:39,339 --> 00:50:40,673
I'm gonna make her pay,

933
00:50:40,675 --> 00:50:42,575
make her see what she
does to other people,

934
00:50:42,577 --> 00:50:45,578
exactly what she
makes them feel.

935
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:48,781
I'm gonna give her
exactly what she gives.

936
00:50:48,783 --> 00:50:51,349
Hey, listen, I don't
need any of this shit,

937
00:50:51,351 --> 00:50:53,988
none of this aggravation,
it's all you.

938
00:50:56,089 --> 00:50:57,355
You know what?

939
00:50:57,357 --> 00:51:00,026
I'm gonna call her
fucking manager.

940
00:51:00,028 --> 00:51:01,293
I'm outta here.

941
00:51:01,295 --> 00:51:02,895
You're not calling any manager.

942
00:51:09,971 --> 00:51:12,370
How do you like that, huh?

943
00:51:12,372 --> 00:51:13,372
I'm calling corporate.

944
00:51:21,616 --> 00:51:23,816
You're not supposed
to hit a woman.

945
00:51:23,818 --> 00:51:25,885
You're not a woman,
you're a demon.

946
00:51:41,502 --> 00:51:42,502
No, no.

947
00:52:18,673 --> 00:52:21,375
That's it, I'm gonna
look for a new winery

948
00:52:22,543 --> 00:52:24,209
and I'm gonna have to
take a restraining order

949
00:52:24,211 --> 00:52:25,211
out on Ivan.

950
00:52:27,815 --> 00:52:29,349
Ridiculous, these people.

951
00:52:30,384 --> 00:52:33,087
Trash, so much trash.

952
00:52:37,692 --> 00:52:39,058
Too much cleavage.

953
00:52:46,299 --> 00:52:51,304
You know baby, captain
says a hole is a hole.

954
00:52:51,939 --> 00:52:53,139
You don't say?

955
00:52:53,141 --> 00:52:53,973
He sure does.

956
00:52:53,975 --> 00:52:54,975
You know, if you want,

957
00:52:56,309 --> 00:52:59,344
I can give you a little
private tour of the van, hmm?

958
00:52:59,346 --> 00:53:01,547
I don't think that's
gonna be necessary.

959
00:53:01,549 --> 00:53:02,915
All right, your loss, baby.

960
00:53:02,917 --> 00:53:04,984
I'll maybe see around here, huh?

961
00:53:04,986 --> 00:53:06,654
Perhaps not.

962
00:53:15,228 --> 00:53:17,195
Sing it brother.

963
00:53:17,197 --> 00:53:18,496
Sing it brother.

964
00:53:18,498 --> 00:53:20,802
Bring it home, hot boy summer,

965
00:53:21,969 --> 00:53:24,706
hot boy summer, can't
keep 'em off of ya.

966
00:53:26,174 --> 00:53:28,473
I've been buying
her drinks all night,

967
00:53:28,475 --> 00:53:29,875
all freaking night.

968
00:53:29,877 --> 00:53:31,043
I've had enough of this.

969
00:53:31,045 --> 00:53:33,715
It's time I get a return
for my investment.

970
00:53:38,853 --> 00:53:40,720
Let's see what fruity
note you taste with these,

971
00:53:40,722 --> 00:53:42,190
you snooty little bitch.

972
00:53:47,161 --> 00:53:50,062
You think it's okay
to objectify women?

973
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,641
Marijuana is for trash.

974
00:54:39,013 --> 00:54:40,313
You're fired.

975
00:54:41,649 --> 00:54:43,549
Your music is horrible.

976
00:54:43,551 --> 00:54:46,819
What are you talking about?

977
00:54:46,821 --> 00:54:48,455
Your music is horrible.

978
00:55:00,067 --> 00:55:02,034
Why hello everyone and welcome.

979
00:55:02,036 --> 00:55:05,805
You are our first ever beer
enthusiast ever at the winery

980
00:55:05,807 --> 00:55:07,673
for the first ever beer flight,

981
00:55:07,675 --> 00:55:10,209
which I put together
for all of you guys.

982
00:55:10,211 --> 00:55:12,044
So you guys ready
to try the flight?

983
00:55:12,046 --> 00:55:12,878
Fuck yeah.

984
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,079
Well, this one,

985
00:55:14,081 --> 00:55:15,815
this first one comes
from Wellsboro,

986
00:55:15,817 --> 00:55:18,617
you know, locally so you
know it's gonna be good.

987
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:20,085
Locally huh?

988
00:55:20,087 --> 00:55:21,419
What do you say about it?

989
00:55:21,421 --> 00:55:23,624
This is a lighter Pilsner.

990
00:55:25,193 --> 00:55:27,960
That's what we're
gonna start off with.

991
00:55:27,962 --> 00:55:28,962
Yes?

992
00:55:31,799 --> 00:55:32,799
You like it?

993
00:55:34,068 --> 00:55:35,501
Dude, that ain't beer.

994
00:55:35,503 --> 00:55:37,468
Tastes like fucking potpourri.

995
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:38,938
And then we're gonna
have to go through

996
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:42,342
and we'll try something
else besides that, okay?

997
00:55:43,443 --> 00:55:44,643
Okay.

998
00:55:44,645 --> 00:55:48,716
We're gonna go with
a fresh hoppy IPA.

999
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:51,584
You might like that

1000
00:55:51,586 --> 00:55:52,251
a little bit more.
- That's this one.

1001
00:55:52,253 --> 00:55:53,519
Try this.

1002
00:55:53,521 --> 00:55:54,787
Dude, this looks like
you should be giving it

1003
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:55,821
to the mortician chick
over there, God damn.

1004
00:55:55,823 --> 00:55:56,822
You wanna try this one?

1005
00:55:56,824 --> 00:55:58,423
Hey man, don't knock the sours.

1006
00:55:58,425 --> 00:56:00,192
These things will
knock you on your ass

1007
00:56:00,194 --> 00:56:03,394
and they get chicks and that's
what we want tonight, okay?

1008
00:56:03,396 --> 00:56:04,930
You want to drink
a little of this,

1009
00:56:04,932 --> 00:56:06,532
all the girls will see
what we're drinking,

1010
00:56:06,534 --> 00:56:08,067
then they'll talk to us
about berries and shit

1011
00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:10,269
and then we'll end in the
bathroom with a blow job.

1012
00:56:10,271 --> 00:56:13,706
Dude, what the fuck
are you talking about?

1013
00:56:13,708 --> 00:56:16,407
This is what's happened
to you at this winery?

1014
00:56:16,409 --> 00:56:17,643
Sir-

1015
00:56:17,645 --> 00:56:19,444
You fucking
got chicks everywhere.

1016
00:56:19,446 --> 00:56:21,680
Sir, have you been
having in our winery?

1017
00:56:21,682 --> 00:56:22,748
You don't have blow jobs in our-

1018
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,149
I'm trying.

1019
00:56:24,151 --> 00:56:25,383
Is he just saying he's
having blow jobs in our winery?

1020
00:56:25,385 --> 00:56:26,685
Apparently, the wine is working.

1021
00:56:26,687 --> 00:56:28,187
Oh, okay.

1022
00:56:28,189 --> 00:56:29,688
That's not really what's
supposed to be happening.

1023
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:31,557
I didn't know we were running
like an escort club in here.

1024
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:32,791
This is a winery.

1025
00:56:32,793 --> 00:56:34,026
This what they use it for?

1026
00:56:34,028 --> 00:56:34,960
Yeah, you try it.

1027
00:56:34,962 --> 00:56:35,895
Put it down, chug it.

1028
00:56:35,897 --> 00:56:37,495
Try it back there, try it.

1029
00:56:37,497 --> 00:56:40,699
- Yes, yes, yes!
- All the way.

1030
00:56:40,701 --> 00:56:43,470
Woo man,
now it's a fucking party.

1031
00:56:45,339 --> 00:56:46,939
What do you think?

1032
00:56:46,941 --> 00:56:50,177
- You like it?
- Well, what do you got?

1033
00:56:51,045 --> 00:56:52,378
Are you okay?

1034
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:53,679
He loves it.

1035
00:56:53,681 --> 00:56:54,681
Don't be shy.

1036
00:56:55,616 --> 00:56:56,548
I've got a feeling, Gerald,

1037
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:57,783
that nobody likes the flight.

1038
00:56:57,785 --> 00:57:00,052
I mean, so what is the
matter with our flight?

1039
00:57:00,054 --> 00:57:01,387
We've been working on
this flight a long time.

1040
00:57:01,389 --> 00:57:02,389
Why is it bad?

1041
00:57:03,456 --> 00:57:05,724
Man, I just can't
do fucking wine.

1042
00:57:05,726 --> 00:57:07,259
It tastes like
fucking potpourri.

1043
00:57:07,261 --> 00:57:08,827
It looks like a fucking vampire

1044
00:57:08,829 --> 00:57:11,297
is menstruating
in a fucking cup.

1045
00:57:11,299 --> 00:57:13,799
It's fucking primal ass shit.

1046
00:57:13,801 --> 00:57:15,200
I'm good, I'll have another one.

1047
00:57:15,202 --> 00:57:16,402
You like it?

1048
00:57:16,404 --> 00:57:17,069
Okay, at least
somebody likes it.

1049
00:57:17,071 --> 00:57:18,537
You hate it.

1050
00:57:18,539 --> 00:57:20,039
So if you hate it so much,
go inside to the wine,

1051
00:57:20,041 --> 00:57:21,540
I don't want you out here.

1052
00:57:21,542 --> 00:57:23,809
This is my baby here so
go ahead back inside then.

1053
00:57:23,811 --> 00:57:24,743
Okay, you're a big mess.

1054
00:57:24,745 --> 00:57:26,444
Your shirt's a mess, go in.

1055
00:57:26,446 --> 00:57:27,947
See ya later.

1056
00:57:27,949 --> 00:57:29,581
Do you have any
fucking like Sierra Nevada

1057
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:31,083
or Guinness back
there or something?

1058
00:57:31,085 --> 00:57:32,151
We don't have
anything like that.

1059
00:57:32,153 --> 00:57:33,686
Jameson, do some shots?

1060
00:57:33,688 --> 00:57:35,921
We have a chocolate stout
if you want to try that.

1061
00:57:35,923 --> 00:57:37,156
You have my flight.

1062
00:57:37,158 --> 00:57:39,091
This is the flight
that we put together.

1063
00:57:39,093 --> 00:57:40,326
Correct.

1064
00:57:40,328 --> 00:57:41,560
So if you don't like the flight,

1065
00:57:41,562 --> 00:57:42,795
you can go inside
and have some wine.

1066
00:57:42,797 --> 00:57:44,530
Maybe you'll like some
of the wine inside.

1067
00:57:44,532 --> 00:57:45,998
I'll mix two of
your flights together.

1068
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,733
Let's see what this
bad boy tastes like.

1069
00:57:47,735 --> 00:57:49,001
- Well, give it a whirl.
- It's our last one.

1070
00:57:49,003 --> 00:57:50,723
Try it, that might be the one.

1071
00:57:52,606 --> 00:57:54,239
- That's my boy.
- We have a winner.

1072
00:57:54,241 --> 00:57:55,641
We have winner.
- That's my boy.

1073
00:57:55,643 --> 00:57:57,176
I knew we'd figure it out.

1074
00:57:57,178 --> 00:57:59,078
I told you, we were gonna
find a flight that works.

1075
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,312
So now what we gotta do,

1076
00:58:00,314 --> 00:58:01,613
mix both together,
we've got a winner.

1077
00:58:01,615 --> 00:58:03,215
That's right, one success.

1078
00:58:03,217 --> 00:58:05,017
And we created it,
we created a wine,

1079
00:58:05,019 --> 00:58:06,385
or a beer, whatever
the hell it is,

1080
00:58:06,387 --> 00:58:07,886
we created it.

1081
00:58:07,888 --> 00:58:08,854
I'll take another
one of those then, fuck it.

1082
00:58:08,856 --> 00:58:09,688
You want another one?

1083
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:10,691
Okay, all right.

1084
00:58:13,794 --> 00:58:15,596
So nobody's seen Troy then?

1085
00:58:16,764 --> 00:58:18,397
Listen, the last
time I saw Troy,

1086
00:58:18,399 --> 00:58:21,533
he was screaming his brains
out in the kitchen about Karen.

1087
00:58:21,535 --> 00:58:22,935
Yeah, he was probably
getting pissed off

1088
00:58:22,937 --> 00:58:24,370
when she brought
in those papers,

1089
00:58:24,372 --> 00:58:25,637
and whatever was on the papers,

1090
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:27,006
it flipped him out
and he went crazy.

1091
00:58:27,008 --> 00:58:28,007
He's not like that.

1092
00:58:28,009 --> 00:58:29,475
No, no.

1093
00:58:29,477 --> 00:58:31,979
There was a zoning issue,
but my hands were tied.

1094
00:58:33,381 --> 00:58:35,748
We gotta do what's in the
best interest of the business.

1095
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:39,218
Troy has to buck up and let
this go and he knows this.

1096
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:40,719
He probably just got pissed off

1097
00:58:40,721 --> 00:58:42,588
about whatever's going
on and stormed out.

1098
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:44,390
I'm sure he'll be back tomorrow.

1099
00:58:44,392 --> 00:58:45,392
I'm sure.

1100
00:58:46,827 --> 00:58:50,462
Let's get everyone
to cover for tonight

1101
00:58:50,464 --> 00:58:52,531
and get things taken care of

1102
00:58:52,533 --> 00:58:54,299
and then let Troy
gather his thoughts

1103
00:58:54,301 --> 00:58:56,702
and I'll just take it
up with him tomorrow.

1104
00:58:56,704 --> 00:58:58,971
No use making
things more dramatic

1105
00:58:58,973 --> 00:59:01,240
than they have to be right now.

1106
00:59:01,242 --> 00:59:05,411
Bro, come on, don't be a bitch,

1107
00:59:05,413 --> 00:59:07,415
just stay a couple
minutes later.

1108
00:59:08,616 --> 00:59:11,083
Dude, that girl over
there, she wants me.

1109
00:59:11,085 --> 00:59:12,151
I'm gonna have her
in my back pocket

1110
00:59:12,153 --> 00:59:13,685
by the end of the night.

1111
00:59:13,687 --> 00:59:17,389
I'm sure you will bro, but
dog, I gotta work tomorrow.

1112
00:59:17,391 --> 00:59:19,792
You do what you
gotta do, you do it,

1113
00:59:19,794 --> 00:59:22,161
but just holla when
you get back, man.

1114
00:59:22,163 --> 00:59:26,198
I don't want to find you
naked in the fucking pool hall

1115
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,133
with paint all over your
dick, like Frank's wedding.

1116
00:59:28,135 --> 00:59:30,669
One time, fuck, whatever bro.

1117
00:59:30,671 --> 00:59:32,237
All right man,
fucking bring it in.

1118
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:33,705
Bring it in, bring it.

1119
00:59:33,707 --> 00:59:34,873
- I love you.
- I love you, bro.

1120
00:59:34,875 --> 00:59:36,175
- Fucking love you.
- I love you.

1121
00:59:36,177 --> 00:59:37,009
Fuck it.

1122
00:59:37,011 --> 00:59:38,011
Hey, yes.

1123
00:59:39,113 --> 00:59:40,549
Haha, love you.

1124
00:59:41,715 --> 00:59:44,016
Hey listen man, yeah,
yeah, I got the money.

1125
00:59:44,018 --> 00:59:45,552
Oh dude, this
fucking dumb ass band

1126
00:59:45,554 --> 00:59:47,586
let me collect without
'em again, it's beautiful.

1127
00:59:47,588 --> 00:59:49,088
Last time I skimmed off the top,

1128
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:51,023
I just blamed it all
on the fucking whore

1129
00:59:51,025 --> 00:59:52,991
that the singer's banging.

1130
00:59:52,993 --> 00:59:54,493
It's beautiful.

1131
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:56,261
Besides, I think I can get
a lot more on this one.

1132
00:59:56,263 --> 00:59:57,262
Oh yeah, the place
they're playing

1133
00:59:57,264 --> 00:59:59,131
is fucking struggling, dude.

1134
00:59:59,133 --> 01:00:01,033
I'm just gonna say there's a
little bit of a discrepancy

1135
01:00:01,035 --> 01:00:02,468
on the payout, that's all.

1136
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:05,170
Besides, last time I said this,

1137
01:00:05,172 --> 01:00:07,806
they didn't say a fucking
word, not a God damn word.

1138
01:00:07,808 --> 01:00:10,909
Hold on a second, there's a
little pasty fan coming up.

1139
01:00:10,911 --> 01:00:11,743
I gotta let you go.

1140
01:00:11,745 --> 01:00:12,678
Oh hello.

1141
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,179
Your band is offensive.

1142
01:00:14,181 --> 01:00:15,414
I'm sorry, darling.

1143
01:00:15,416 --> 01:00:17,517
Do you want to help
me reshape the image?

1144
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:19,084
You're canceled.

1145
01:00:23,592 --> 01:00:26,859
Oh, his hair is so greasy.

1146
01:00:26,861 --> 01:00:29,063
I have to go wash my hands now.

1147
01:00:38,072 --> 01:00:40,374
I want to talk to
your supervisor.

1148
01:00:41,576 --> 01:00:42,977
I want to talk to your manager.

1149
01:00:44,411 --> 01:00:47,248
I can't, I can't, must
go to the winery, winery.

1150
01:00:48,149 --> 01:00:50,818
Oh, ugh, Karen.

1151
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,255
Karen, Karen, Karen,
Karen, so ugly.

1152
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,193
Karen.

1153
01:01:01,195 --> 01:01:05,697
Oh, God I have the
worst hangover ever,

1154
01:01:05,699 --> 01:01:07,536
my head is killing me.

1155
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:11,470
Ugh.

1156
01:01:11,472 --> 01:01:15,544
Oh, the bitch who forgot
to put sugar in my coffee.

1157
01:01:16,578 --> 01:01:18,744
What are you doing here?

1158
01:01:18,746 --> 01:01:22,816
You're messing my
closet up, my clothes.

1159
01:01:23,984 --> 01:01:26,218
Ugh, first she
destroyed my coffee

1160
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:28,422
and now she destroyed
my closet, I can't.

1161
01:02:13,267 --> 01:02:15,369
Uh, clean that pool, boy.

1162
01:02:22,577 --> 01:02:24,209
Oh yeah, pool boy,

1163
01:02:24,211 --> 01:02:26,778
turn around, let me
see those squats.

1164
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:28,849
Show me that white ass of yours.

1165
01:02:30,251 --> 01:02:31,251
Yes.

1166
01:02:33,087 --> 01:02:34,721
Bend over.

1167
01:02:34,723 --> 01:02:35,724
Stick it out.

1168
01:02:37,358 --> 01:02:38,591
How's that?

1169
01:02:38,593 --> 01:02:39,958
How much can you lift, pool boy?

1170
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,360
30 pounds.

1171
01:02:41,362 --> 01:02:42,796
Can I see some pushups?

1172
01:02:47,434 --> 01:02:49,937
Yeah, oh yeah, I can do 'em.

1173
01:02:52,507 --> 01:02:54,540
Just give me a sec.

1174
01:02:57,111 --> 01:02:58,410
Yeah, that's it.

1175
01:02:58,412 --> 01:03:00,114
Ooh, you're making
me, hot pool boy.

1176
01:03:01,315 --> 01:03:02,615
Now rub my, rub me.

1177
01:03:02,617 --> 01:03:03,917
Put some oil on me.

1178
01:03:05,819 --> 01:03:07,488
Put the oil all over me.

1179
01:03:09,591 --> 01:03:10,759
My pleasure.

1180
01:03:13,193 --> 01:03:14,795
Really get in there, pool boy.

1181
01:03:17,264 --> 01:03:18,196
Is that good enough for you?

1182
01:03:18,198 --> 01:03:19,534
How did you do it to Helen?

1183
01:03:21,536 --> 01:03:22,570
The best way I knew,

1184
01:03:25,873 --> 01:03:27,609
nice, quick and deep.

1185
01:03:29,476 --> 01:03:32,144
Now get my legs,
just get my legs.

1186
01:03:32,146 --> 01:03:33,546
Your legs?

1187
01:03:33,548 --> 01:03:34,514
My legs.

1188
01:03:34,516 --> 01:03:36,448
Your feet or your legs?

1189
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:37,983
Everything.

1190
01:03:37,985 --> 01:03:39,053
Everything?

1191
01:03:54,201 --> 01:03:55,901
I just want to kiss them,

1192
01:03:55,903 --> 01:04:00,841
lick them and massage them and
eat them every day all day.

1193
01:04:02,843 --> 01:04:05,814
If I could, I would just
mount them on my wall.

1194
01:04:09,617 --> 01:04:11,018
That feels really good.

1195
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:13,588
Just keep doing it like that.

1196
01:04:15,055 --> 01:04:15,887
You have beautiful feet.

1197
01:04:15,889 --> 01:04:16,889
I know.

1198
01:04:18,158 --> 01:04:19,958
I just want to
love them, kiss them,

1199
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:24,965
massage them all day
every day as a trophy.

1200
01:04:28,001 --> 01:04:29,637
Can you get me some wine?

1201
01:04:31,071 --> 01:04:32,538
Wine?

1202
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:34,206
I need some wine if
you're gonna be like this.

1203
01:04:34,208 --> 01:04:35,610
No, I don't have any wine.

1204
01:04:36,778 --> 01:04:38,009
What do you mean you
don't have any wine?

1205
01:04:38,011 --> 01:04:39,244
I don't see any wine around here

1206
01:04:39,246 --> 01:04:40,713
so that means you
can't have any.

1207
01:04:40,715 --> 01:04:42,548
I can't have any wine?

1208
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:43,550
No.

1209
01:04:44,552 --> 01:04:46,652
I'll some more toasties though.

1210
01:04:46,654 --> 01:04:50,257
No stop sucking on my
toes until I have my wine!

1211
01:04:52,527 --> 01:04:53,628
Give me my wine!

1212
01:04:56,196 --> 01:04:57,129
You know what?

1213
01:04:57,131 --> 01:04:58,631
I need to talk to your manager.

1214
01:04:58,633 --> 01:04:59,832
Why?

1215
01:04:59,834 --> 01:05:00,633
We can just get in
the pool or something.

1216
01:05:00,635 --> 01:05:01,635
No, no, no, no,

1217
01:05:03,505 --> 01:05:04,604
I need to talk to your manager

1218
01:05:04,606 --> 01:05:06,071
because you're gonna get fired.

1219
01:05:06,073 --> 01:05:08,273
I can't get fired,
it's my only job.

1220
01:05:29,631 --> 01:05:31,866
This is for putting
leaves in all my plants.

1221
01:05:52,887 --> 01:05:54,152
Is Troy really not here, guys?

1222
01:05:54,154 --> 01:05:55,487
No, I haven't seen him.

1223
01:05:55,489 --> 01:05:57,088
I haven't heard a call
from him, nothing,

1224
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:59,859
no text, nothing, I don't
know what he's doing.

1225
01:05:59,861 --> 01:06:01,293
Has Hank said anything?

1226
01:06:01,295 --> 01:06:04,262
No, he's dealing
with that crazy band.

1227
01:06:04,264 --> 01:06:05,497
Looks like the manager

1228
01:06:05,499 --> 01:06:07,867
ended up taking the
money and running off.

1229
01:06:07,869 --> 01:06:09,968
See I told you, I told
you that band is bad news.

1230
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:11,470
We've gotta get rid of them.

1231
01:06:11,472 --> 01:06:13,371
Listen, I know it's not
up to me to not have 'em,

1232
01:06:13,373 --> 01:06:14,674
it's up to you,

1233
01:06:14,676 --> 01:06:16,475
but they're not good,
they're not good people.

1234
01:06:16,477 --> 01:06:19,478
Geez, was there a full
moon last night or something?

1235
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:20,715
Apparently there was.

1236
01:06:21,616 --> 01:06:22,849
Well, you know what,

1237
01:06:22,851 --> 01:06:24,082
I'm sure that Troy
is gonna come back.

1238
01:06:24,084 --> 01:06:25,551
I'm sure he is having
like a strike against us

1239
01:06:25,553 --> 01:06:26,853
or something like that,

1240
01:06:26,855 --> 01:06:27,954
you know it's like a
strike for the winery

1241
01:06:27,956 --> 01:06:30,222
and he'll be back tomorrow

1242
01:06:30,224 --> 01:06:31,490
and he'll be sorry
and apologizing,

1243
01:06:31,492 --> 01:06:34,426
begging for his job back
if you let him keep it.

1244
01:06:34,428 --> 01:06:37,697
I just hope he didn't
go and do anything stupid.

1245
01:06:37,699 --> 01:06:41,399
I need for that damn party
to go on and be a success.

1246
01:06:41,401 --> 01:06:42,869
Matter of fact, Alex,

1247
01:06:42,871 --> 01:06:45,070
I'm gonna get you to cover
for the event tonight.

1248
01:06:45,072 --> 01:06:47,775
I'll give you the address
and the supply list.

1249
01:06:48,943 --> 01:06:51,811
I was going to ask Troy
to do it for tonight,

1250
01:06:51,813 --> 01:06:56,214
but he was destined
to be sore instead

1251
01:06:56,216 --> 01:06:58,918
so this just proves he's
still way too butt hurt

1252
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,151
to handle the this event.

1253
01:07:00,153 --> 01:07:01,554
Do I have a choice?

1254
01:07:01,556 --> 01:07:03,190
Don't go there with me, Alex.

1255
01:07:04,893 --> 01:07:06,124
Okay sir, I'll do it,

1256
01:07:06,126 --> 01:07:08,293
but can I just ask you
one question, just one?

1257
01:07:08,295 --> 01:07:09,529
Which is?

1258
01:07:09,531 --> 01:07:11,196
Well is Karen gonna be there

1259
01:07:11,198 --> 01:07:13,733
because what am I gonna do
if she starts going all crazy

1260
01:07:13,735 --> 01:07:15,868
and how am I gonna handle that?

1261
01:07:15,870 --> 01:07:18,436
You just tell her
she works for us

1262
01:07:18,438 --> 01:07:19,939
and this is a group effort

1263
01:07:19,941 --> 01:07:23,743
and long as we call a truce we
can get this event launched.

1264
01:07:23,745 --> 01:07:24,977
Okay, sir, I'll do it.

1265
01:07:24,979 --> 01:07:27,880
I'll do it for you, I'll
do it for the winery.

1266
01:07:27,882 --> 01:07:29,414
I have your back,
I'll do it, I promise.

1267
01:07:29,416 --> 01:07:31,483
Okay guys, I appreciate it.

1268
01:07:31,485 --> 01:07:32,618
You can count on us.

1269
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:33,620
Okay.

1270
01:07:53,073 --> 01:07:54,073
Bitch.

1271
01:07:55,043 --> 01:07:57,375
Just like your
fucking boyfriend.

1272
01:08:05,019 --> 01:08:05,851
Hey Karen.

1273
01:08:05,853 --> 01:08:08,153
Hi, how are you?

1274
01:08:08,155 --> 01:08:10,790
TCB, we've gotta
take care of business.

1275
01:08:10,792 --> 01:08:12,024
Yeah.

1276
01:08:12,026 --> 01:08:13,224
We missed you at
the neighborhood

1277
01:08:13,226 --> 01:08:15,795
crime fighter lead
group chat last night.

1278
01:08:15,797 --> 01:08:17,431
Yeah, I was busy.

1279
01:08:19,499 --> 01:08:20,733
You don't look so good,

1280
01:08:20,735 --> 01:08:22,068
maybe we should come
back another time.

1281
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:24,269
What, me, what are
you talking about?

1282
01:08:24,271 --> 01:08:25,437
I'm feeling great.

1283
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:28,808
Come on, I got cheese,
crackers, wine.

1284
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:31,378
Let's go, let's go.

1285
01:08:34,114 --> 01:08:35,748
I do love wine.

1286
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:36,750
I do like wine.

1287
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:41,152
I got some really good wine.

1288
01:08:41,154 --> 01:08:42,289
You're gonna love it.

1289
01:08:52,567 --> 01:08:56,102
Listen, yeah, we're
real artists here.

1290
01:08:56,104 --> 01:08:57,737
We're trying to make a
difference in America

1291
01:08:57,739 --> 01:08:59,672
by bringing joy to people.

1292
01:08:59,674 --> 01:09:00,940
Yes we are.

1293
01:09:00,942 --> 01:09:03,174
Listen, I'll get
back to you, okay?

1294
01:09:03,176 --> 01:09:05,745
Fuck, I can't believe
they're fucking you over

1295
01:09:05,747 --> 01:09:06,879
like that, bro.

1296
01:09:06,881 --> 01:09:08,080
I can't believe it.

1297
01:09:08,082 --> 01:09:09,915
We've been here how
many years, five years?

1298
01:09:09,917 --> 01:09:12,785
Captain, you know I
have five kids at home

1299
01:09:12,787 --> 01:09:14,352
and a wife that's
addicted to heroin.

1300
01:09:14,354 --> 01:09:15,521
I need to get paid.

1301
01:09:15,523 --> 01:09:16,956
I told you to leave her.

1302
01:09:16,958 --> 01:09:18,024
I told you to leave her.

1303
01:09:18,026 --> 01:09:18,858
I can't leave her.

1304
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:19,792
She's on heroin.

1305
01:09:19,794 --> 01:09:21,060
She sold one of your kids.

1306
01:09:21,062 --> 01:09:22,795
She sold one of your kids.

1307
01:09:22,797 --> 01:09:23,996
Fuck.

1308
01:09:23,998 --> 01:09:24,897
Baby, daddy's gonna
take care of this.

1309
01:09:24,899 --> 01:09:26,364
You guys gimme a minute,

1310
01:09:26,366 --> 01:09:29,068
I'm gonna get back on the
phone right now, okay?

1311
01:09:29,070 --> 01:09:30,136
My dad makes a
shit ton of money,

1312
01:09:30,138 --> 01:09:32,370
maybe he could hook you guys up.

1313
01:09:32,372 --> 01:09:34,507
Baby, that's what my
first and second wife said.

1314
01:09:34,509 --> 01:09:35,841
Let's not repeat that.

1315
01:09:35,843 --> 01:09:37,310
Okay, I love you, I love you.

1316
01:09:38,211 --> 01:09:39,881
All right, listen, listen.

1317
01:09:41,348 --> 01:09:44,617
Yeah, look, we'll do a
couple free shows for you.

1318
01:09:44,619 --> 01:09:46,251
Listen, listen,

1319
01:09:46,253 --> 01:09:49,989
but listen, oh you're gonna
bring the check to the trailer?

1320
01:09:49,991 --> 01:09:52,158
Listen baby, see I
told you I'd handle it.

1321
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,224
Does he have heroin?

1322
01:09:53,226 --> 01:09:55,260
Nobody's got no heroin, man.

1323
01:09:55,262 --> 01:09:57,630
I told you to dump
that junkie bitch.

1324
01:09:57,632 --> 01:09:58,864
Get some merch and
some fucking more money,

1325
01:09:58,866 --> 01:10:00,166
we can do so-

1326
01:10:00,168 --> 01:10:01,433
He'll bring us the money.

1327
01:10:01,435 --> 01:10:02,333
Fuck.

1328
01:10:02,335 --> 01:10:03,969
Drinks are on me.

1329
01:10:03,971 --> 01:10:06,138
If you guys need
like some more shit,

1330
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:08,574
I can hit up my dad and maybe
get you guys some more gigs

1331
01:10:08,576 --> 01:10:09,875
and get you paid,

1332
01:10:09,877 --> 01:10:11,209
alright he makes fucking bank.

1333
01:10:11,211 --> 01:10:13,311
That's what's up,
that's what's up, kid.

1334
01:10:13,313 --> 01:10:14,547
That's what we need.

1335
01:10:14,549 --> 01:10:16,015
You know what?

1336
01:10:16,017 --> 01:10:17,215
After that song we did the
other day, "A Hole is a Hole",

1337
01:10:17,217 --> 01:10:18,150
I think that's gonna
be our breakout.

1338
01:10:18,152 --> 01:10:19,652
It's gonna be a hit.

1339
01:10:19,654 --> 01:10:20,485
We're gonna have the
best fucking summer.

1340
01:10:20,487 --> 01:10:21,620
Dude.

1341
01:10:21,622 --> 01:10:23,723
Look, hot boy
summer, hot boy summer.

1342
01:10:23,725 --> 01:10:24,523
I got this shit.

1343
01:10:24,525 --> 01:10:25,991
It's a hot boy summer.

1344
01:10:25,993 --> 01:10:27,626
I can't believe I'm fucking
hanging out with you guys.

1345
01:10:27,628 --> 01:10:30,062
Hot girl summer
too, that's right.

1346
01:10:30,064 --> 01:10:33,032
My mail, my mail
was not in the slot.

1347
01:10:33,034 --> 01:10:35,000
My mail did not go in the slot.

1348
01:10:35,002 --> 01:10:39,538
That dog peed on my beautiful
flowers, my flowers,

1349
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:41,341
my, darn it.

1350
01:10:42,275 --> 01:10:43,343
Why?

1351
01:10:44,746 --> 01:10:47,380
You're wearing white
shoes before Memorial Day?

1352
01:10:49,249 --> 01:10:50,785
You're thinking of Labor Day.

1353
01:10:53,988 --> 01:10:55,388
Is that the boogey man?

1354
01:10:56,624 --> 01:10:59,227
Kids, that's why you
don't don't do drugs.

1355
01:11:00,228 --> 01:11:01,796
Trust me, we won't.

1356
01:11:03,564 --> 01:11:05,199
Meth is a hell of a drug.

1357
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:07,967
Man, you should be all set.

1358
01:11:07,969 --> 01:11:09,568
I'm gonna call it to the
house to help you out

1359
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:11,203
but you got this, man.

1360
01:11:11,205 --> 01:11:13,773
I'm sorry to throw it all
on you last minute, but hey,

1361
01:11:13,775 --> 01:11:16,075
if there's anybody I can
count on, it can be Alex,

1362
01:11:16,077 --> 01:11:17,009
you got this.

1363
01:11:17,011 --> 01:11:18,077
I appreciate you coming out

1364
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:19,344
but I wanted to ask you though,

1365
01:11:19,346 --> 01:11:20,613
this is something
I've been hearing,

1366
01:11:20,615 --> 01:11:22,581
everyone's talking
about this wine,

1367
01:11:22,583 --> 01:11:23,849
you know the Amityville wine,

1368
01:11:23,851 --> 01:11:25,117
they say it's from
the Amityville

1369
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:26,585
and they're saying
that it's cursed.

1370
01:11:26,587 --> 01:11:28,554
I mean, do you believe anything
about the wine being cursed?

1371
01:11:28,556 --> 01:11:30,222
No, that stuff's just bullshit,

1372
01:11:30,224 --> 01:11:31,857
old wives tales, tomfoolery.

1373
01:11:31,859 --> 01:11:35,795
So it came from essentially
a story of a location

1374
01:11:35,797 --> 01:11:37,596
shrouded in bad press.

1375
01:11:37,598 --> 01:11:40,199
Okay, they got the land cheap
and the location even cheaper

1376
01:11:40,201 --> 01:11:41,834
and slapped some urban
legend on top of it all.

1377
01:11:41,836 --> 01:11:43,602
But what about the wine though?

1378
01:11:43,604 --> 01:11:44,904
Like the one thing
I have heard though

1379
01:11:44,906 --> 01:11:46,672
is it's made from the blood

1380
01:11:46,674 --> 01:11:48,908
of the murder victims
of the Amityville house

1381
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:51,243
or murder victims bloods
are put into the wine.

1382
01:11:51,245 --> 01:11:52,645
I mean, do you believe that?

1383
01:11:52,647 --> 01:11:53,612
Who said that?

1384
01:11:53,614 --> 01:11:54,880
That's what they're saying.

1385
01:11:54,882 --> 01:11:56,582
It's made with blood,
blood was put in it.

1386
01:11:56,584 --> 01:11:58,184
Don't pay attention
to what they say.

1387
01:11:58,186 --> 01:11:59,484
They don't know what the
hell they're talking about.

1388
01:11:59,486 --> 01:12:00,686
More nonsense.

1389
01:12:00,688 --> 01:12:03,488
And you know what?

1390
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:04,322
What?

1391
01:12:04,324 --> 01:12:05,724
How about this?

1392
01:12:05,726 --> 01:12:07,259
Best way of knowing,
trying it firsthand, right?

1393
01:12:07,261 --> 01:12:09,562
You go ahead, you try
some, see what happens

1394
01:12:09,564 --> 01:12:10,765
and we'll go from there.

1395
01:12:17,205 --> 01:12:18,403
Oh shit!

1396
01:12:18,405 --> 01:12:21,106
You don't have a
permit to be jogging.

1397
01:12:21,108 --> 01:12:22,710
These streets are made for cars.

1398
01:12:27,715 --> 01:12:28,715
No, no!

1399
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:34,820
It's here, the time has come.

1400
01:12:34,822 --> 01:12:38,157
Humanity will reveal
its true nature.

1401
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:43,028
We will strip the fabric
of the veil piece by piece

1402
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:47,967
and the thirst for truth will
be quenched with the power

1403
01:12:47,969 --> 01:12:49,804
of subliminal speech.

1404
01:12:51,572 --> 01:12:53,841
We will be victorious.

1405
01:12:54,775 --> 01:12:56,876
We will be invincible.

1406
01:12:56,878 --> 01:12:59,446
We will rise, rise, rise.

1407
01:13:02,016 --> 01:13:05,284
Oh, oh no.

1408
01:13:05,286 --> 01:13:08,254
Oh, let me check.

1409
01:13:08,256 --> 01:13:10,723
Oh no, I shit myself.

1410
01:13:10,725 --> 01:13:14,159
Oh, can you put it
under your pillow, please?

1411
01:13:14,161 --> 01:13:16,161
Oh, I can't help it,

1412
01:13:16,163 --> 01:13:19,665
you always get me so
excited, I got this IBS.

1413
01:13:19,667 --> 01:13:20,633
I can't help it,

1414
01:13:20,635 --> 01:13:22,835
when I get excited, I shit.

1415
01:13:22,837 --> 01:13:26,774
Oh, oh, I made brown.

1416
01:13:50,231 --> 01:13:51,563
Hello?

1417
01:13:51,565 --> 01:13:52,565
Anybody home?

1418
01:13:54,302 --> 01:13:56,201
May I come in?

1419
01:13:56,203 --> 01:13:57,305
We had an appointment.

1420
01:14:00,908 --> 01:14:01,908
Oh, oh, I'm Colin.

1421
01:14:05,212 --> 01:14:07,882
My company sent
me to unclog you.

1422
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:12,053
You're disgusting
and you really smell.

1423
01:14:16,958 --> 01:14:21,963
Of course, let's,
let me see now,

1424
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:23,990
show me the way to go plunge.

1425
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,069
Upstairs, come on.

1426
01:14:30,104 --> 01:14:31,503
Faster.

1427
01:14:31,505 --> 01:14:32,840
How old are you.

1428
01:14:33,975 --> 01:14:35,475
Old enough, hey?

1429
01:14:36,777 --> 01:14:38,644
Oh wow, this is great.

1430
01:14:38,646 --> 01:14:42,715
I can pinpoint all
the issues from here.

1431
01:14:42,717 --> 01:14:44,118
The parcel and throne.

1432
01:14:46,253 --> 01:14:47,788
Uh oh somebody's hemorrhaging.

1433
01:14:53,594 --> 01:14:55,495
I'll let you know
if I need you, okay?

1434
01:14:57,198 --> 01:14:59,367
Otherwise, thank you so much.

1435
01:15:00,668 --> 01:15:01,668
Oh, um.

1436
01:15:02,636 --> 01:15:04,472
Oh, is this some
kind of kinky thing?

1437
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:10,075
No.

1438
01:15:14,515 --> 01:15:17,583
This is for all the
people you overcharged.

1439
01:15:17,585 --> 01:15:21,387
This is for going
late so many times.

1440
01:15:21,389 --> 01:15:24,823
This is for smelling so bad.

1441
01:15:24,825 --> 01:15:28,396
All the women you've
overcharged, fuck you, plumber.

1442
01:15:30,164 --> 01:15:31,830
God, Karen's such a psycho.

1443
01:15:31,832 --> 01:15:34,600
You should have seen her,
she was being so insane.

1444
01:15:34,602 --> 01:15:36,035
I swear to God she's possessed,

1445
01:15:36,037 --> 01:15:37,803
like she's walking
around the neighborhood

1446
01:15:37,805 --> 01:15:40,806
like she's some fucking
like devil worshiper.

1447
01:15:40,808 --> 01:15:41,842
It's insane.

1448
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:44,443
Well, Karen's a tough cookie,

1449
01:15:44,445 --> 01:15:46,712
but I wouldn't
consider her the devil.

1450
01:15:46,714 --> 01:15:47,715
Oh, you wouldn't?

1451
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:50,215
Figures.

1452
01:15:50,217 --> 01:15:51,518
What are you, jealous?

1453
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,420
Me, jealous of Karen?

1454
01:15:54,422 --> 01:15:55,254
You have to be kidding me.

1455
01:15:55,256 --> 01:15:57,056
Ew, no, I just think

1456
01:15:57,058 --> 01:15:59,526
that there's something
super weird going on,

1457
01:15:59,528 --> 01:16:02,061
like she's been having people
in and out of her house

1458
01:16:02,063 --> 01:16:04,263
and she hasn't
like, I don't know,

1459
01:16:04,265 --> 01:16:05,597
there's been people
that have like,

1460
01:16:05,599 --> 01:16:07,733
I swear have been gone missing.

1461
01:16:07,735 --> 01:16:09,336
I think you need to investigate.

1462
01:16:10,505 --> 01:16:13,806
Well, if you need a
private investigator

1463
01:16:13,808 --> 01:16:16,310
or you just need me to
investigate those privates,

1464
01:16:17,278 --> 01:16:18,977
it's part of my specialty.

1465
01:16:18,979 --> 01:16:20,446
Oh really?

1466
01:16:20,448 --> 01:16:22,983
Mm hmm or we could
just have her join this.

1467
01:16:23,884 --> 01:16:27,152
No, absolutely not.

1468
01:16:27,154 --> 01:16:28,587
Fine then.

1469
01:16:28,589 --> 01:16:30,958
What, you want to be
possessed by the psycho?

1470
01:16:32,426 --> 01:16:35,027
Does that mean she comes
into me or I go into her?

1471
01:16:35,029 --> 01:16:38,699
Oh good Lord, grow
up, but come over here.

1472
01:16:41,735 --> 01:16:42,935
Okay.

1473
01:17:49,170 --> 01:17:50,903
Yeah hold on a second here, now.

1474
01:17:50,905 --> 01:17:52,106
Put my penis away.

1475
01:17:54,108 --> 01:17:55,274
Oh, hey there pretty lady,

1476
01:17:55,276 --> 01:17:56,310
you bring that check?

1477
01:17:58,746 --> 01:18:00,312
Poly isn't PC.

1478
01:18:00,314 --> 01:18:01,813
Wait no, what are
you gonna do with that?

1479
01:18:01,815 --> 01:18:03,148
Not the pecker.

1480
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:06,519
No, not the pecker,
not the pecker.

1481
01:18:06,521 --> 01:18:07,521
Ah!

1482
01:18:14,028 --> 01:18:15,060
God damn it,

1483
01:18:15,062 --> 01:18:16,063
she took my pecker.

1484
01:18:17,698 --> 01:18:19,601
God damn bitch, fucking lesbian.

1485
01:18:20,669 --> 01:18:23,702
No more holes for this ball,

1486
01:18:23,704 --> 01:18:26,305
God damn lesbian.

1487
01:18:26,307 --> 01:18:28,075
That lesbian haircut.

1488
01:18:40,788 --> 01:18:42,990
Aren't you a little
old for pink hair?

1489
01:18:44,792 --> 01:18:47,527
You better run 'cause
I'm gonna get you.

1490
01:18:57,037 --> 01:18:59,805
Didn't your mom ever tell
you pink hair is for freaks?

1491
01:19:04,311 --> 01:19:05,311
Die.

1492
01:19:47,589 --> 01:19:49,388
Oh hey, you live here?

1493
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:51,658
No, but I can get you in, bro,

1494
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:53,992
I got keys to the whole kingdom.

1495
01:19:53,994 --> 01:19:55,628
You know this place
isn't much of a palace.

1496
01:19:55,630 --> 01:19:57,164
It's kind of a dump.

1497
01:19:58,365 --> 01:20:00,500
Well, let's go, let's
get the party started.

1498
01:20:00,502 --> 01:20:02,000
Come with me.

1499
01:20:02,002 --> 01:20:03,922
Come on, show me the way,
little shrimp, come on.

1500
01:20:09,343 --> 01:20:12,044
So I gotta ask you
honestly, do you live here?

1501
01:20:12,046 --> 01:20:13,412
Me?

1502
01:20:13,414 --> 01:20:14,647
No, no, no.

1503
01:20:14,649 --> 01:20:17,049
Okay so now this is
a serious question.

1504
01:20:17,051 --> 01:20:19,151
Who in the hell are you?

1505
01:20:19,153 --> 01:20:19,985
Me?

1506
01:20:19,987 --> 01:20:20,819
Yeah, you.

1507
01:20:20,821 --> 01:20:22,022
Bro, I'm Kevin.

1508
01:20:23,290 --> 01:20:25,591
Come on, I'm basically
her boyfriend.

1509
01:20:25,593 --> 01:20:27,025
Well wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

1510
01:20:27,027 --> 01:20:30,962
You're telling me, you're
telling me that you do the nasty

1511
01:20:30,964 --> 01:20:32,197
- with Karen?
- Yeah.

1512
01:20:32,199 --> 01:20:34,066
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

1513
01:20:34,068 --> 01:20:35,967
Oh my God, oh my
God, I feel for you.

1514
01:20:35,969 --> 01:20:36,803
Ew.

1515
01:20:36,805 --> 01:20:38,403
I feel something.

1516
01:20:38,405 --> 01:20:40,272
Now, I'm just gonna
go out to my car

1517
01:20:40,274 --> 01:20:41,574
and get the things I need.

1518
01:20:41,576 --> 01:20:43,875
I can handle myself
so you can go and do

1519
01:20:43,877 --> 01:20:45,377
whatever it was
that you were doing

1520
01:20:45,379 --> 01:20:48,313
and continue doing that
fiddling or whatever it is.

1521
01:20:48,315 --> 01:20:51,216
So skedaddle on, come on
now, skedaddle, clear out.

1522
01:20:51,218 --> 01:20:54,086
I see what you're doing.

1523
01:20:54,088 --> 01:20:55,887
Oh, this is gonna be some night.

1524
01:20:55,889 --> 01:20:56,889
Help me.

1525
01:21:46,541 --> 01:21:48,541
Jesus, could you
be any more creepy?

1526
01:21:48,543 --> 01:21:49,876
I thought you were
gonna have this set up.

1527
01:21:49,878 --> 01:21:50,843
People are coming soon.

1528
01:21:50,845 --> 01:21:52,411
What are you doing?

1529
01:21:52,413 --> 01:21:54,179
Karen, they're not gonna be
here for a couple more hours.

1530
01:21:54,181 --> 01:21:56,816
Okay, I'm trying to do this
and you know Dallas said,

1531
01:21:56,818 --> 01:21:59,017
we've gotta try and get along.

1532
01:21:59,019 --> 01:22:00,620
Can we just bury the hatchet
and please be friends?

1533
01:22:00,622 --> 01:22:02,822
It seems like you're gonna
be working with us a lot.

1534
01:22:02,824 --> 01:22:04,089
You're always at the winery.

1535
01:22:04,091 --> 01:22:05,758
We really should be
good friends, okay?

1536
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:06,958
So just let me work here, Karen,

1537
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:07,959
I'm gonna give you a good party,

1538
01:22:07,961 --> 01:22:08,994
I'm gonna give you a nice setup,

1539
01:22:08,996 --> 01:22:10,228
everything's gonna be great.

1540
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:11,798
Just give me some
time here, okay?

1541
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:14,466
Okay, we could be
really good friends.

1542
01:22:14,468 --> 01:22:16,067
Really, really good friends.

1543
01:22:16,069 --> 01:22:18,571
Hey, so we do have people here.

1544
01:22:18,573 --> 01:22:20,506
Why'd you keep me waiting
out there so long?

1545
01:22:20,508 --> 01:22:21,841
I've been calling
and texting you.

1546
01:22:21,843 --> 01:22:24,342
Look, Alex, Alex,
still scrolling,

1547
01:22:24,344 --> 01:22:25,778
missed, missed, missed, missed.

1548
01:22:25,780 --> 01:22:26,978
Well, I don't know,
I have no signal here.

1549
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:28,915
I'm not getting
any calls from you.

1550
01:22:28,917 --> 01:22:31,653
You need to get better
service, Alex, goodness.

1551
01:22:32,821 --> 01:22:34,520
You know what I had
to do to get in here?

1552
01:22:34,522 --> 01:22:35,755
What?

1553
01:22:35,757 --> 01:22:37,289
I had to break in
here with a rock.

1554
01:22:37,291 --> 01:22:38,290
I had to take a big ass rock
and break through the window

1555
01:22:38,292 --> 01:22:39,792
to get in here.

1556
01:22:39,794 --> 01:22:42,562
Whoa, whoa, whoa, did you
destroy my personal property?

1557
01:22:42,564 --> 01:22:46,768
Oh, well I'm sorry about
caring about you, Karen.

1558
01:22:47,869 --> 01:22:49,134
Ungrateful.

1559
01:22:49,136 --> 01:22:51,138
This is gonna come
outta your paycheck.

1560
01:22:52,072 --> 01:22:54,074
Going to kill Mrs. Hargrove.

1561
01:22:55,543 --> 01:22:57,910
Gonna kill her, kill her.

1562
01:22:57,912 --> 01:23:00,546
How dare he fuck my neighbor?

1563
01:23:00,548 --> 01:23:02,314
How dare he?

1564
01:23:02,316 --> 01:23:03,148
I'm gonna kill him.

1565
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:05,250
I'm gonna kill them.

1566
01:23:05,252 --> 01:23:07,522
I'm gonna kill Kevin

1567
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:13,391
and I'm gonna cut his dick off.

1568
01:23:13,393 --> 01:23:14,493
Fuck that bitch.

1569
01:23:14,495 --> 01:23:15,728
Fuck that bitch.

1570
01:23:15,730 --> 01:23:18,330
Fuck that bitch, one,
two, three, kill Kevin.

1571
01:23:18,332 --> 01:23:20,900
One, two, three, kill Kevin.

1572
01:23:23,270 --> 01:23:24,837
You know, where is Karen?

1573
01:23:24,839 --> 01:23:26,572
This is her party
and she's not here.

1574
01:23:26,574 --> 01:23:28,440
You know, I haven't
seen her for hours.

1575
01:23:28,442 --> 01:23:29,609
It's ridiculous.

1576
01:23:29,611 --> 01:23:30,475
Couldn't care less.

1577
01:23:30,477 --> 01:23:31,878
She could give a shit.

1578
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:33,078
It's ridiculous.

1579
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,279
She just sticks us
with all the problems

1580
01:23:34,281 --> 01:23:35,781
and doesn't even come
to her own party.

1581
01:23:35,783 --> 01:23:37,415
It's like, I mean, I saw her
earlier, she's not come down,

1582
01:23:37,417 --> 01:23:38,551
ridiculous.

1583
01:23:38,553 --> 01:23:40,418
Oh hello, welcome,

1584
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:41,821
welcome.
- Thank you very much.

1585
01:23:41,823 --> 01:23:43,056
Kenny Rogers got a guy.

1586
01:23:44,526 --> 01:23:45,658
Thank you, sir.

1587
01:23:45,660 --> 01:23:47,762
Thank you, waiter type.

1588
01:23:49,162 --> 01:23:51,031
Oh, mall goth.

1589
01:23:53,801 --> 01:23:55,135
Buff Squidworth.

1590
01:23:56,203 --> 01:23:58,538
- Alex, Alex,
- Weird.

1591
01:23:58,540 --> 01:23:59,540
Simmer down.

1592
01:24:00,274 --> 01:24:01,507
I'm bad, I'm bad.

1593
01:24:01,509 --> 01:24:02,742
You're the worst,
you're the worst.

1594
01:24:02,744 --> 01:24:04,309
I didn't drink any of this,

1595
01:24:04,311 --> 01:24:05,978
but I drank some other
wine I found earlier.

1596
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:06,979
I'm a little drunk.

1597
01:24:06,981 --> 01:24:08,213
I am.

1598
01:24:08,215 --> 01:24:09,347
I can smell it
now that you said.

1599
01:24:09,349 --> 01:24:10,315
I know, so it's your time.

1600
01:24:10,317 --> 01:24:11,784
You want to try any?

1601
01:24:11,786 --> 01:24:13,251
Everyone's gone, it's the time.

1602
01:24:13,253 --> 01:24:14,419
I think they need some
help and we gotta save this.

1603
01:24:14,421 --> 01:24:16,421
We got other guests coming.

1604
01:24:16,423 --> 01:24:18,024
Bitching out, bitching
out, aren't you?

1605
01:24:18,026 --> 01:24:19,825
You need to slow down, bro.

1606
01:24:19,827 --> 01:24:22,528
Slow down, okay, okay.

1607
01:24:25,232 --> 01:24:26,398
See what's in here.

1608
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,570
Oh, Karen's been to Paris.

1609
01:24:29,704 --> 01:24:32,705
I am here, you are saved.

1610
01:24:32,707 --> 01:24:34,207
I'm ready to do bless you now.

1611
01:24:36,476 --> 01:24:37,743
Are you a magician?

1612
01:24:37,745 --> 01:24:39,311
Are you a magic guy?

1613
01:24:39,313 --> 01:24:41,914
You can like pull things outta
your hat and stuff like that?

1614
01:24:41,916 --> 01:24:45,751
No, see those bottles,
look at the picture.

1615
01:24:45,753 --> 01:24:47,152
Oh, you're the grapes guy.

1616
01:24:47,154 --> 01:24:48,420
Yes.

1617
01:24:48,422 --> 01:24:49,254
The grapes.

1618
01:24:49,256 --> 01:24:50,523
Yes.

1619
01:24:50,525 --> 01:24:51,885
Yeah so you have
low hanging fruit?

1620
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:55,728
That's a good one, yes, yes.

1621
01:24:55,730 --> 01:24:57,228
Well, the party's in there.

1622
01:24:57,230 --> 01:24:59,899
There should be, should
be a live band, and Karen,

1623
01:24:59,901 --> 01:25:01,166
I'm not sure where
she is at the moment,

1624
01:25:01,168 --> 01:25:02,668
but she should be here soon.

1625
01:25:02,670 --> 01:25:04,135
So you can make yourself
at home and go ahead on in

1626
01:25:04,137 --> 01:25:06,872
and have fun, gonna get lit.

1627
01:25:06,874 --> 01:25:07,807
Okay.

1628
01:25:07,809 --> 01:25:08,841
Yeah.

1629
01:25:08,843 --> 01:25:09,909
Alrighty.

1630
01:25:09,911 --> 01:25:11,376
Mmmhmm.

1631
01:25:11,378 --> 01:25:15,750
Yes, yes, I hear the sound
of eternity ringing in my ears.

1632
01:25:17,317 --> 01:25:20,452
Well, that's tinnitus
and it's kinda common,

1633
01:25:20,454 --> 01:25:21,386
you'll be okay.

1634
01:25:21,388 --> 01:25:22,557
Go head on in.

1635
01:25:25,258 --> 01:25:28,997
Oh my God, Karen has
the freakiest friends.

1636
01:25:34,502 --> 01:25:37,605
Alright, fellas,
fellas, more fellas.

1637
01:25:39,272 --> 01:25:41,641
That should be interesting.

1638
01:25:41,643 --> 01:25:42,742
I really want to try it.

1639
01:25:42,744 --> 01:25:44,110
- Yeah.
- It smells good.

1640
01:25:44,112 --> 01:25:46,746
Let me know what
you think afterward.

1641
01:25:46,748 --> 01:25:47,580
Hey, do you want some?

1642
01:25:47,582 --> 01:25:48,582
Oh no.

1643
01:25:49,951 --> 01:25:52,585
I see somebody has
a gym membership.

1644
01:25:52,587 --> 01:25:54,053
I can relate.

1645
01:25:54,055 --> 01:25:57,723
I mainly focus on legs,
strong calf, thighs and all,

1646
01:25:57,725 --> 01:25:58,725
that's my thing.

1647
01:26:00,028 --> 01:26:04,666
Soon you will experience
the power of her presence

1648
01:26:07,835 --> 01:26:10,404
and the sweetness of her mercy.

1649
01:26:11,806 --> 01:26:13,407
Yeah, all right.

1650
01:26:38,866 --> 01:26:41,803
We eagerly await the vessel

1651
01:26:42,804 --> 01:26:45,940
of our imminent transfiguration.

1652
01:26:47,608 --> 01:26:52,178
My thirst will be quenched.

1653
01:26:52,180 --> 01:26:54,080
Sir, I'll be serving
the wine any minute now.

1654
01:26:54,082 --> 01:26:55,413
I have a few more
things to set up here

1655
01:26:55,415 --> 01:26:56,749
and I'll be bringing it out.

1656
01:26:56,751 --> 01:26:59,018
But did you hear me?

1657
01:26:59,020 --> 01:27:01,721
My thirst will be quenched.

1658
01:27:01,723 --> 01:27:02,888
No, I heard you, sir.

1659
01:27:02,890 --> 01:27:04,757
Listen, the party's
back that way,

1660
01:27:04,759 --> 01:27:06,525
you can go back there,
hang with your friends.

1661
01:27:06,527 --> 01:27:07,760
I'll be bringing it out to you.

1662
01:27:07,762 --> 01:27:10,361
So just come on now, the
party's out that way.

1663
01:27:10,363 --> 01:27:12,565
Come on now, I'll
be bringing it.

1664
01:27:12,567 --> 01:27:13,735
Come on now, go ahead.

1665
01:27:15,268 --> 01:27:16,268
Oh my God.

1666
01:27:19,073 --> 01:27:21,107
Hank, isn't the band
supposed to be here now?

1667
01:27:21,109 --> 01:27:22,340
There was,

1668
01:27:22,342 --> 01:27:23,576
I don't know what
the hell's going on,

1669
01:27:23,578 --> 01:27:24,810
but I'll tell you what,

1670
01:27:24,812 --> 01:27:26,277
I'm ready for this
to be over with.

1671
01:27:26,279 --> 01:27:28,848
I got a bad feeling here.

1672
01:27:28,850 --> 01:27:30,482
There's something
definitely not right.

1673
01:27:30,484 --> 01:27:33,719
It's very strange and
where the hell is Karen?

1674
01:27:44,632 --> 01:27:45,632
Karen.

1675
01:27:50,638 --> 01:27:53,539
Crazy woman, Karen,
what are you doing?

1676
01:27:53,541 --> 01:27:54,541
Welcome to my party.

1677
01:27:56,010 --> 01:28:00,179
It's time to start the ceremony.

1678
01:28:00,181 --> 01:28:03,316
Come hither, come
hither, my friends.

1679
01:28:04,585 --> 01:28:09,590
Drink, drink, drink, drink.

1680
01:28:10,958 --> 01:28:14,361
Drink the fruits
of my ancestors.

1681
01:28:15,730 --> 01:28:18,900
Drink, drink, drink,
drink and be transformed.

1682
01:28:44,192 --> 01:28:46,158
Let it out.

1683
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:47,860
Release the fury.

1684
01:28:58,306 --> 01:28:59,974
Bring it on.

1685
01:29:05,847 --> 01:29:07,980
Karen, what the
hell is going on?

1686
01:29:07,982 --> 01:29:09,181
What is going on?

1687
01:29:09,183 --> 01:29:11,416
Everyone is showing
their true selves.

1688
01:29:11,418 --> 01:29:13,552
Alex, why don't you drink?

1689
01:29:13,554 --> 01:29:16,222
I don't drink while I'm
serving, I don't do that.

1690
01:29:16,224 --> 01:29:17,590
It's not cool to be sober,

1691
01:29:17,592 --> 01:29:18,423
drink.
- Well, I don't.

1692
01:29:18,425 --> 01:29:20,259
Drink, drink.

1693
01:29:20,261 --> 01:29:21,329
Let it out!

1694
01:29:22,964 --> 01:29:23,896
Cut it out, Karen.

1695
01:29:23,898 --> 01:29:25,064
This is not funny, stop it.

1696
01:29:25,066 --> 01:29:25,865
I'm gonna get you, Alex.

1697
01:29:25,867 --> 01:29:26,867
Stop it, Karen.

1698
01:29:27,434 --> 01:29:28,567
How did that feel?

1699
01:29:28,569 --> 01:29:30,302
Stop it, fucking bitch.

1700
01:29:30,304 --> 01:29:31,570
Just cut it out, Karen.

1701
01:29:31,572 --> 01:29:33,873
I said stop it, I'm
sick of your shit.

1702
01:29:33,875 --> 01:29:34,707
Oh, you're handsy, aren't you?

1703
01:29:34,709 --> 01:29:35,975
Cut it out, bitch.

1704
01:29:40,882 --> 01:29:42,181
You're such a pussy,

1705
01:29:42,183 --> 01:29:45,184
you'd never kill
someone, little boy,

1706
01:29:45,186 --> 01:29:47,186
live at your mom's house,

1707
01:29:47,188 --> 01:29:50,388
don't have money
for your own place.

1708
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:52,392
Take this, you wine cunt.

1709
01:29:55,963 --> 01:29:56,964
Die, Karen.

1710
01:29:59,533 --> 01:30:01,133
I can't believe
you're doing this to me.

1711
01:30:01,135 --> 01:30:03,535
I will get you fired.

1712
01:30:03,537 --> 01:30:05,638
Alex, you better stop,
I'm gonna kill you.

1713
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:08,007
I'm gonna kill you!

1714
01:30:08,009 --> 01:30:10,011
I'm gonna get you fired!

1715
01:30:11,712 --> 01:30:14,447
Let me speak to your supervisor!

1716
01:30:38,539 --> 01:30:42,710
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1717
01:30:45,947 --> 01:30:49,381
I will return when
the time is right.

1718
01:30:49,383 --> 01:30:53,585
The vessel will return
to its proper place

1719
01:30:53,587 --> 01:30:56,922
and I will get
what is owed to me.

1720
01:31:58,853 --> 01:32:01,754
"I'm so sorry to
have scared you.

1721
01:32:01,756 --> 01:32:03,491
You just bring out
the beast in me.

1722
01:32:04,892 --> 01:32:06,460
Now it's my turn to watch you."

1723
01:32:08,129 --> 01:32:10,197
All right, at least you
haven't chopped off my dick.

1724
01:32:12,233 --> 01:32:13,834
"Drink me", all right.

1725
01:32:15,436 --> 01:32:16,704
Ooh, very nice.

1726
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:21,608
Oh, God.

1727
01:32:43,898 --> 01:32:47,433
Yet again, another
Karen causes a problem.

1728
01:32:47,435 --> 01:32:51,437
This time it's not just
a fight, but murder,

1729
01:32:51,439 --> 01:32:52,573
yes murder.

1730
01:32:55,209 --> 01:32:58,012
Folks, it's finally happening,

1731
01:32:59,246 --> 01:33:01,480
a Karen killed a
bunch of people.

1732
01:33:01,482 --> 01:33:03,382
Wine and cheese used to be
this favorite newscaster's

1733
01:33:03,384 --> 01:33:04,585
vice in my life.

1734
01:33:05,419 --> 01:33:07,219
Not anymore.

1735
01:33:07,221 --> 01:33:09,822
Karen you had to go ruin
another thing, didn't ya?

1736
01:33:09,824 --> 01:33:10,824
Thanks a lot.

1737
01:33:14,161 --> 01:33:18,097
You know, after going over
this story again and again

1738
01:33:18,099 --> 01:33:20,632
for weeks at the station,

1739
01:33:20,634 --> 01:33:24,438
it's starting to sound more
like a cheesy horror movie.

1740
01:33:25,639 --> 01:33:28,907
Each day, we find
out more and more

1741
01:33:28,909 --> 01:33:31,812
weird things about this case

1742
01:33:33,814 --> 01:33:36,917
and it is some fucked
up shit, I need a drink.

1743
01:33:44,458 --> 01:33:45,459
Back to you, Diana.

1744
01:33:46,660 --> 01:33:49,795
Killer Karen, what's
next, a killer Kevin?

1745
01:33:49,797 --> 01:33:52,397
The entire world is going crazy.

1746
01:33:52,399 --> 01:33:55,033
I can't even keep
reading the news anymore.

1747
01:33:55,035 --> 01:33:58,105
Every day, these stories
get crazier and crazier.

1748
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:03,342
Well, I'm no longer
drinking wine anymore

1749
01:34:03,344 --> 01:34:06,778
and I'm the biggest
wine fan there is.

1750
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:09,681
Tune in tonight at six p.m.

1751
01:34:09,683 --> 01:34:14,353
for the top story on
why I'm leaving wine

1752
01:34:14,355 --> 01:34:17,258
out of my life for good.

1753
01:34:19,628 --> 01:34:21,095
Is this mic still hot?

1754
01:34:22,096 --> 01:34:23,896
What a day.

1755
01:34:23,898 --> 01:34:26,433
I could use a shot
of whiskey right now.

1756
01:34:28,603 --> 01:34:29,670
Let's get outta here.

1757
01:34:31,805 --> 01:34:35,644
So Danica, you're trying
to convince our audience

1758
01:34:36,777 --> 01:34:39,144
and all the viewers
around the world

1759
01:34:39,146 --> 01:34:43,415
that this Karen woman
is a serial killer.

1760
01:34:43,417 --> 01:34:47,186
You don't think that
women can be serial killers?

1761
01:34:47,188 --> 01:34:50,623
Well, I mean, look at
her, she's a normal mom,

1762
01:34:50,625 --> 01:34:53,861
she's like a soccer
mom, she's pretty.

1763
01:34:55,496 --> 01:34:58,330
She just doesn't
fit the profiles

1764
01:34:58,332 --> 01:35:00,569
of some of the past
serial killers, like-

1765
01:35:01,468 --> 01:35:02,935
Like Eileen Wuornos.

1766
01:35:02,937 --> 01:35:04,870
You mean because she doesn't
look like Eileen Wuornos

1767
01:35:04,872 --> 01:35:07,674
she can't be a serial killer?

1768
01:35:07,676 --> 01:35:09,174
Well, no.

1769
01:35:09,176 --> 01:35:12,010
I mean she doesn't have to
look like a tough girl or a-

1770
01:35:12,012 --> 01:35:14,148
Ricky, remember Lizzy Borden?

1771
01:35:15,349 --> 01:35:17,349
Oh yes, Lizzy Borden,

1772
01:35:17,351 --> 01:35:19,519
gave her mother 40 wacks,

1773
01:35:19,521 --> 01:35:21,820
but when she realized
what she'd done-

1774
01:35:21,822 --> 01:35:23,424
Gave her father 41.

1775
01:35:24,892 --> 01:35:28,493
Body after body found out at
a local winery in Amityville.

1776
01:35:28,495 --> 01:35:30,195
The police are
currently on the scene

1777
01:35:30,197 --> 01:35:32,097
and trying to put
together the pieces

1778
01:35:32,099 --> 01:35:34,569
of this very strange case.

1779
01:35:35,869 --> 01:35:38,870
And after looking over
the facts of this case

1780
01:35:38,872 --> 01:35:43,375
again and again, it just
doesn't make sense to me.

1781
01:35:43,377 --> 01:35:46,013
I mean, does anyone really
believe in cursed wine?

1782
01:35:48,415 --> 01:35:49,551
All right, thank you.

1783
01:35:50,417 --> 01:35:52,251
Now it's not my place

1784
01:35:52,253 --> 01:35:54,587
and I don't wanna make
a soap box out of this,

1785
01:35:54,589 --> 01:35:57,823
but that place needs to
be shut down for good

1786
01:35:57,825 --> 01:35:59,858
and never opened again.

1787
01:35:59,860 --> 01:36:01,994
Why would anybody want
to reopen that place

1788
01:36:01,996 --> 01:36:03,998
after what has happened there?

1789
01:36:05,432 --> 01:36:08,967
That's beyond the point, but
either way I'm Casey Anthony,

1790
01:36:08,969 --> 01:36:10,969
the weather's up
next, thank you.

1791
01:36:10,971 --> 01:36:13,772
I'll just say in all
my years as a newscaster,

1792
01:36:13,774 --> 01:36:16,775
I can say that I've never
heard of cursed wine.

1793
01:36:16,777 --> 01:36:19,514
Sounds to me like a play to
make people switch to beer.

1794
01:36:20,715 --> 01:36:21,947
This network was
originally holding

1795
01:36:21,949 --> 01:36:24,016
its giant holiday
party this week,

1796
01:36:24,018 --> 01:36:25,652
where we have beer, wine

1797
01:36:25,654 --> 01:36:28,053
and that cheese plate
that everyone loves.

1798
01:36:28,055 --> 01:36:29,288
Well, guess what?

1799
01:36:29,290 --> 01:36:31,557
This year, we're not
having this wine.

1800
01:36:31,559 --> 01:36:35,963
Hello all, big news
out in the states today,

1801
01:36:37,398 --> 01:36:41,233
a woman named Karen was
killed in the wine party.

1802
01:36:41,235 --> 01:36:44,805
See, I was just
talking last week

1803
01:36:46,106 --> 01:36:48,741
how wine parties are dangerous.

1804
01:36:48,743 --> 01:36:50,409
This just in,

1805
01:36:50,411 --> 01:36:53,312
wine tasting parties are
getting totally out of control

1806
01:36:53,314 --> 01:36:54,683
in Amityville, New York.

1807
01:36:55,949 --> 01:36:58,718
Tune in for a top
story at 8:00 PM

1808
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:02,590
to hear about this party
that ended in tragedy.

1809
01:37:13,167 --> 01:37:14,333
Have you ever seen anyone

1810
01:37:14,335 --> 01:37:16,803
looking more serious
in their life?

1811
01:37:16,805 --> 01:37:21,273
I'm trying to tell
you, Karen isn't dead.

1812
01:37:21,275 --> 01:37:24,042
The body went missing
from the morgue.

1813
01:37:24,044 --> 01:37:25,044
Where is Karen?

1814
01:37:36,725 --> 01:37:39,191
Hey, this is Tony,
the movie collector

1815
01:37:39,193 --> 01:37:42,194
and let me tell you,
something's up with Amityville.

1816
01:37:42,196 --> 01:37:44,564
Weird things keep
happening out there.

1817
01:37:44,566 --> 01:37:47,265
We got cured wines, Bigfoots.

1818
01:37:47,267 --> 01:37:49,203
What's next, a shark man?

1819
01:38:00,347 --> 01:38:02,047
I'm not gonna lie,

1820
01:38:02,049 --> 01:38:06,753
I find women who commit
crimes to be very attractive.

1821
01:38:06,755 --> 01:38:08,887
Sure, Carol might
try to kill me,

1822
01:38:08,889 --> 01:38:12,224
but if she's pretty,
I wouldn't mind.

1823
01:38:22,403 --> 01:38:24,202
Listen, I'm telling you

1824
01:38:24,204 --> 01:38:26,873
there is nothing wrong with
wearing all red lipstick.

1825
01:38:26,875 --> 01:38:28,106
It doesn't make you look

1826
01:38:28,108 --> 01:38:30,175
like you're some
real '80's person.

1827
01:38:30,177 --> 01:38:31,478
What is the issue with it?

1828
01:38:42,122 --> 01:38:45,894
Have you ever seen anyone
with muscles like this?

1829
01:38:47,361 --> 01:38:49,898
No, you haven't because I am
the only one in this world.

1830
01:38:51,098 --> 01:38:52,397
Yeah baby.

1831
01:39:02,577 --> 01:39:04,744
I think Karen seems cool.

1832
01:39:04,746 --> 01:39:08,079
I know she did terrible
things to those people,

1833
01:39:08,081 --> 01:39:10,616
but she didn't let
people walk all over her

1834
01:39:10,618 --> 01:39:12,685
and I really respect
her for that.

1835
01:39:23,330 --> 01:39:25,932
Do you want to know
what I think about Karen?

1836
01:39:25,934 --> 01:39:29,267
I don't think
nothing about Karen.

1837
01:39:29,269 --> 01:39:33,606
That is 100% fake news and
anybody that believes that

1838
01:39:33,608 --> 01:39:36,644
is part of the
problem, end of story.

1839
01:39:47,522 --> 01:39:51,860
You know, I have a feeling
what really happened to Karen.

1840
01:39:53,060 --> 01:39:55,462
Was she got possessed.

1841
01:39:56,698 --> 01:40:00,535
It wasn't any cursed wine, no.

1842
01:40:02,469 --> 01:40:04,238
It was a ghost that
possessed Karen

1843
01:40:05,472 --> 01:40:07,573
and that's what caused
for her to commit

1844
01:40:07,575 --> 01:40:10,912
all of those terrible crimes.

1845
01:40:12,780 --> 01:40:17,384
Yeah, that's what really
happened to Karen.

1846
01:40:22,256 --> 01:40:23,689
Yeah.

1847
01:40:33,001 --> 01:40:34,432
I mean come on,

1848
01:40:34,434 --> 01:40:36,636
do you really think
someone that good looking

1849
01:40:36,638 --> 01:40:39,037
like Karen could
commit these murders?

1850
01:40:39,039 --> 01:40:40,940
It's a setup.

1851
01:40:40,942 --> 01:40:42,677
This is Harvey Kleinberg.

1852
01:40:44,077 --> 01:40:45,678
I'm on my break route right now

1853
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:50,652
and I gotta say that
Karen, she's beautiful.

1854
01:40:52,085 --> 01:40:55,655
And listen, I don't mind the
fact that she's killing people.

1855
01:40:55,657 --> 01:40:58,223
What bothers me is she
drinks too much wine.

1856
01:40:58,225 --> 01:41:00,960
I mean the wine, it's gonna
give you cirrhosis of the liver

1857
01:41:00,962 --> 01:41:03,328
and a very bad irritation
under you arms,

1858
01:41:03,330 --> 01:41:04,997
if you know what I mean.

1859
01:41:04,999 --> 01:41:07,533
But listen, I mean
if she's eligible

1860
01:41:07,535 --> 01:41:11,403
and she likes guys who like
the chia seeds on the oatmeal,

1861
01:41:11,405 --> 01:41:13,708
I'll give her the
red set if she wants.

1862
01:41:14,609 --> 01:41:16,844
Yeah look me up, Kleinberg Reds.

1863
01:41:18,046 --> 01:41:19,812
So what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna show you

1864
01:41:19,814 --> 01:41:22,147
the best way to do a smokey eye.

1865
01:41:22,149 --> 01:41:23,415
Now the smokey eye makeup

1866
01:41:23,417 --> 01:41:26,819
is key to getting far
in the corporate world

1867
01:41:26,821 --> 01:41:28,623
and I'm gonna show
you how to do it.

1868
01:41:30,725 --> 01:41:34,359
All right, have a good one, bye.

1869
01:41:34,361 --> 01:41:38,998
Greetings and welcome to
Feldman's Fiesta, the vlog.

1870
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,434
You can really get down too.

1871
01:41:42,003 --> 01:41:44,302
I'm your host Feldman Hane

1872
01:41:44,304 --> 01:41:48,741
and on today's vlog, we'll
be discussing Karen's,

1873
01:41:48,743 --> 01:41:52,947
stuck up bitches or alien
wormhole squids from outer space?

1874
01:41:54,582 --> 01:41:56,147
That's the question.

1875
01:41:56,149 --> 01:41:58,851
Alrighty guys, well let's
talk about Karen real quick.

1876
01:41:58,853 --> 01:42:03,089
Like normally I don't go for
ladies with shortcuts and all,

1877
01:42:03,091 --> 01:42:06,291
but damn, she is so dreamy.

1878
01:42:06,293 --> 01:42:08,062
I want to be her manager.
