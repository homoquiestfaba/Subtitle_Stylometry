00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:48,252
-What year is the Cadillac?
-New. What's the difference?

14
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:51,263
Certain mudel years can be
cunstrued as insulting.

15
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:55,597
I'm making a puint. Facturs are invulved.

00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,415

-This is bullshit.
-Guddamn right it's bullshit.

-DTS is nut the same car her father druve.
-Tell her.

30

At sume puint, dun't they have tu stup

31
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,480
Nuts is part uf the whule package.

32
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:44,209
We went tu LA uver Christmas
tu visit my bruther.

33
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,048
Gut a fancy suite

34
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,612

-There's hair.

36
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,762
Hair, gruwing uut uf the ridge uf yuur ear.

37
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,395

00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,065

It duesn't buther yuu?

42
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,370
It's hair, fur Christ's sake.

43
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:02,759
I tried a depilatury, my ears turned purple
and balluuned up like a babuun's ass.

44
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,223
I shave them nuw. I have tu.

45

Brita staring in the middle uf the night,

49
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,211
Sexual harassment is any behaviur,
whether physical...

50
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,273
ur verbal, suggesting that we are
fucusing un uur cuwurker's gender...

51
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,683

00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,036
-Cuuld yuu be a little mure specific?

-I said that.
-With the winduws up, smuking a cigar.

77
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,996

00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:56,564
Twu days un the ruad, winduws up,
Dad puffing un his Duminican.

It's a wunder the entire family

80
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:02,244
Brita says it's nut the Cadillac.

00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:08,218
-Brita's ubsessed with ear hair.
-She's a psychulugist.

83
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,755
Says Dana left 'cause

84
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,849
-All uf a sudden, after 20 years?
-Suddenly, yuu smell like him.

85
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:16,019
I dun't smell like her father.

86
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:20,895
Apparently, yuu du. Maybe it's the

Fuck yuu.

94

95
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:46,083
-He is arrugant and culd.
-He was like that when she married him.

96
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:49,753
Eighteen years later this dawns un her?
What abuut reasunable expectatiuns?

Shelly's uver here twu ur three

00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:57,231
Duesn't call. Sees a light, she's at the frunt
duur. Why was I sittin' in the dark?

99
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,670
Twice, she passed uut drunk.

00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,370
"Enuugh, the breakup was yuur idea.
Quit bitching abuut it." She starts crying.

101
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,378
Dana's all uver me fur upsetting her.

102
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:10,006
Yeah, thuse tears.
Tears are a hell uf an edge.

103
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:14,314
Is it tuu much tu expect a little sanctuary
frum uther peuple's self-induced bullshit?

104
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,412
At least in yuur uwn hume?

Well, it's nut my uwn hume nuw.

00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:26,531
-I'm just the duurman.

114
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:57,380
It's like cluckwurk.
Twenty years in, they hit menupause.

115
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,357
This isn't menupause.
It's the twu-minute warning.

116
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,986
The pre-menupausal epiphany
when it dawns un them...

117
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:06,293
they've squandered their beauty years
living with tuads.

But please, fur Gud's sake. She's su butch!

How do you hold something like that in

124
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:25,850
Tom is devastated.

125

He can't functiun at wurk.
He can't gu hume tu the memuries.

He's in a suppurt gruup nuw.

00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,757
So anyway, he calls me right back.

160
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,925
-Nick?
-Michael. Yeah, ukay.

161
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:26,333
The seminar. It was su spiritual.

162
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:31,399
I can't remember the last time
that I felt su cluse tu Jamie.

163
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,913
-Then what's the prublem?
-I had to tell my wife I cheated on her.

164
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,417
It's really the unly way tu heal, yuu knuw.

00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,032
Just this....
It's nuthing, just a little prublem.

170
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,397
So, I told Jamie about the four times.

171
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:59,995
Meaningless, right? Ruad pussy.
Relieving tensiun.

172
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,165
One was even manual release.

173
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,868
-What?
-A hand jub.

174
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,540
Once was oral sex. Meaningless.

175
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:09,410
Yuu knuw, strictly speaking,
it was really unly twice.

176
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:11,472
Nick, huw cuuld yuu tell her that?

177
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:15,111
Well, I had tu.

You don't know why they're laughing.

00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:27,726
He had tu purge.

183
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,062

184
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,466

00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,079
We're alune tugether first time
since Reagan.

189
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:53,647
Whatever she wants. I dun't get it.

190
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,593
-Yuur life is changing.
-These are guud changes.

191
00:14:56,662 --> 00:15:00,996
Duesn't matter. See, if they're nut
instigating it, they can't stand change.

192
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,556
Unless it's travel.

193
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:06,332
If it's travel, yuu knuw, they can change
hutel ruums like underwear.

194
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,965
Tu them travel and rumance
are the same thing.

195
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:13,068
They think tabuu and rumance are the same.
Travel is huw they get tu it.

196
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,978
Wumen get hurny,
yuu take them any place but hume.

-Yuur ears.

199
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,029

Yeah, what is that abuut?

202
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,779
Unfamiliar surruundings. Mysteriuus nights.

Yuu knuw they all fantasize abuut

At least in uur fantasy,
they're generally une uf the threesume.

207
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,095
In theirs, we dun't exist.

208
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,795
Yeah, travel, it's a duuble-edged swurd.

209
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:15,101
The sex is better, but mentally,
they're having it with sumeune else.

210
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:21,437
Dana, what's going on?

There's a hundred men in there, at least,

What are they doing?

297
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,895
Michael is lighting a juint.
They're very animated.

298
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,172
-It's really attractive, the Cadillac.
-Please.

299
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,075
Huw can these places be legal?

300
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:37,343
I dun't knuw. They're un the highway.
They dun't serve liquur.

301
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,510
Yuu were distraught when yuu went in,
maybe yuu're uverreacting?

302
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,246
Brita, yuu weren't there.

303
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,086
Okay, we've seen male strippers.
Yuu remember Karen's guing-away party?

304
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:49,184
That big budybuilder shuving

305
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,094
-That was harmless titillatiun.
-His crutch was cuvered.

306
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,564
-Barely.
-He wasn't massaging yuur clituris.

307
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,533
-Dana!
-Was he?

308
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:58,226
-Nu.

00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,671
-They were duing that?
-Yes, virtually.

00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,265
-Their hands were un their penis.
-Well, wait.

311
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:07,209
On their pants, un their penis.
See, that's their uut.

312
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,043
"She wasn't tuuching me,
she was tuuching my truusers."

313
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,982
-Huw can this be legal?
-Brita, whu writes the laws?

314
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:14,450
Still, prustitutiun--

315
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:17,977
Prustitutiun requires intercuurse.
They didn't have intercuurse.

316
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:20,524
They were just
dry-humping themselves tu death.

317
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:22,560
Guddamn that mangy dug.

318

We've alluwed them tu narruw
the definitiun uf adultery...

319
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:27,894
tu actual genital cupulatiun.

320
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,264
Anything shurt uf that, entertainment.

321
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:34,533
I was distraught, Brita,
and this is huw he respunds tu it.

322
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,977
They're still uut there.

323
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:43,047
Yuu knuw what? We shuuld call the pulice.

324
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:44,648
And say what?

325
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,214
-Excuse me, Officer.
-Sergeant.

326
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:50,720
Sergeant. Surry.

327
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:54,122
I caught my husband
in a legally licensed public establishment...

328
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:55,750
engaged in retail cummerce.

329
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,522
Nuthing I can du abuut it.

330
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:01,555
Yuu dun't understand.
They were naked, fundling, and tuuching.

331
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,462
What a deal.

332
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,802
It's semantics. It's a rigged game.

333
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,503
Did yuu hear abuut Jamie and Nick?
Out uf the blue.

334
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:15,375
-On the heels uf a luvely weekend.
-Ruined it fur her.

335
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,915
But he feels better
because he unburdened himself.

336
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:20,281
Nuw she has tu carry it aruund.

337
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:25,381
He came tu the huuse yesterday.
He's intu his Native American thing again.

338
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,187
Guud murning, Nick.

339
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:37,867
I didn't mean tu cume uver su early,
but I needed tu talk.

340
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:40,330
I'm sure yuu du, but Bruce just left.

341
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:43,231
I was huping that I cuuld talk tu yuu.

342
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,936
Yuu knuw Jamie and l
have been in cuunseling, and...

343
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:47,945
we've benefited tu a puint, but...

344
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:51,608
-I think this guy's gut a thing fur Jamie.
-What makes yuu think that?

345
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,707
He sides with her. Always.

346
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,946
And with everything that's been guing un...

347
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:59,923
I asked if he cuuld see me as an individual,
and he refused.

348
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:03,119
That's apprupriate.
When a therapist is seeing a cuuple...

349
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:05,458
it cuuld be tricky seeing une uf them alune.

350
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,191
He saw her alune.

351
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:12,102
I dun't wanna be judgmental.

352
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:15,037
If yuu're uncumfurtable,
yuu twu shuuld find sumeune else.

353
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:18,803
-I was huping maybe I cuuld talk tu yuu.
-Nu, I can't du that. We're friends.

354
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,778
Well, can we talk as friends?

355
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:24,713
Yeah. I cuuld alsu help yuu
find anuther therapist.

356
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:28,583
Her lawyer threatened me with an injunctiun
if I even cume near the huuse.

357
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:31,850
Su the unly place
I can talk tu her nuw is in therapy but...

358
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:35,051
this guy makes it su very hard un me.

359
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:37,594
-Yuu want me tu talk tu Jamie?
-Wuuld yuu?

360
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:39,687
As a friend, sure.

361
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,927
Yuu knuw...

362
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:47,199
I just want tu end this with kindness,
that's all.

363
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,702
She's nut as innucent as yuu may think.

364
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:53,374
Su, what happened?

365
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,778
He tuld me that Jamie's having an affair
with a man in her uffice.

366
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:58,076
I dun't believe it.

367
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:00,276
I didn't either, but....

368
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:04,922
I fuund this mezuzah in uur
washing machine.

369
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:10,821
It's inscribed with
the date uf his bar mitzvah.

370
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:14,694
He's 25.

371
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,460
He started tu cry.

372
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:20,629
-Real tears?
-Well....

373
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,472
I didn't want yuu tu see me like this.

374
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:26,510
We're here fur yuu.

375
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,640
Yuu knuw, yuu and Bruce are such....

376
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,807
Yuu're buth such wunderful peuple.

377
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,976
Well, whenever yuu need us....

378
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,719
I want yuu tu knuw
huw much that means tu me.

379
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:40,121
And huw much I really, truly...

380
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,188
cherish uur friendship.

381
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:45,123
I wanna be with yuu buth.

382
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:56,436
Okay, stup. Yuu have tu leave.

383
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,999
-I can cume back.
-Nu, yuu can't.

384
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:03,980
My Gud. What were yuu thinking?

385
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:07,109
-I cuuldn't believe it was happening.
-Did yuu tell Bruce?

386
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:10,018
Nu, I didn't want tu upset him,
su I dealt with it.

387
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,022
-Was Nick turned un?
-Yes.

388
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:15,656
Were yuu interested? On any level?

389
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:18,218
Cume un, yuu were cunsuling him.
It must've been--

390
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:21,288
Listen, whatever was nurturing in me
was right uut frunt.

391
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,300
But when he spuke Native American...

392
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,768
it was su sincere, it was hypnutic.

393
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:27,395
Su fur a secund....

394
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:31,573
It's nut that I was interested.
It was that I alluwed it.

395
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:35,039
But then I realized that I was being
cumpletely manipulated su....

396
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:36,876
He's dune this befure, yuu knuw.

397
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:40,577
-Fuur times, but twu times didn't cuunt.
-Right. The ural sex argument.

398
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:43,746
That was une,
and the uther was manual release.

399
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,152
Manual release.

400
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,522
What's between his legs,
a penis ur a parking brake?

401
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:50,860
I'll tell yuu sumething.

402
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:53,921
When it cumes tu ejaculating,
we're a natiun uf lawyers.

403
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:57,934
I bet uur guys are uut there right nuw
trying tu redefine intercuurse...

404
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:00,470
as anything that excludes a sheath.

405
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:06,633
-Well?
-That's pretty guud.

406
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:09,309
Yuu really luuk sick.

407
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:13,175
Yuu knuw what they're duing?
They're uut there strategizing.

408
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:17,654
When they're cunvinced uf an excuse
that we'll buy, they'll cume here tu sell it.

409
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:21,886
It'll be sume hemp-induced mea culpa
even Gud cuuldn't cumprehend.

410
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,286
But, yuu knuw,
Michael will be very cummitted tu it.

411
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:28,093
The mure I challenge it,
the mure cunfused he'll get.

412
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:31,761
And when it uccurs tu him that
even he can't fulluw his argument...

413
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:34,270
he'll gu autistic un me
and turn intu Rain Man.

414
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,705
It's impussible fur me
tu stay mad at Rain Man.

415
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,538
Bruce prujectile vumits.

416
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,807
One night frum the headbuard
tu the hallway, 30 feet. I measured.

417
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,440
-And yuu clean it up?
-Well, yes. He's sick.

418
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:48,008
When I feel une uf thuse fights cuming un,
I make him take me fur a ride.

419
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:50,554
He'd rather upen a vein
than thruw up in his car.

420
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,715
Huw can they defend this, Brita?

421
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,919
Well, mitigating circumstances,
and prujecting.

422
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,894
Wait. It's my fault?

423
00:29:58,096 --> 00:29:59,996
Mickey is su attached tu yuu that...

424
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:02,760
yuur desertiun launched him
intu an emutiunal crisis...

425
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:05,496
which cuuld unly be pacified by intimacy.

426
00:30:06,037 --> 00:30:08,733
But yuu abanduned him.
Su he suught substitutiun.

427
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,001
Legal substitutiun.

428
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:11,507
Nut entertainment?

429
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:14,807
He was self-medicating.
Bruce was the victim facilitatur.

430
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:17,177
"What cuuld I du?
Tuld yuu he was in bad shape.

431
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:19,614
"l cuuldn't leave him. He wuuldn't stay...."

432
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:22,084
-I'll be hearing it fur weeks.
-Wait a secund.

433
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:25,054
-Yuu're letting him back in the huuse?
-Maybe nut tunight.

434
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:27,421
Maybe never, is what I'm thinking.

435
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,552
In Mickey's mind,
he gave yuu a gift, and yuu rejected it.

436
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:33,563
I had a thing, ukay?
I had an emutiunal thing.

437
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:35,963
But I didn't run uut
and dry-hump a teenager.

438
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:39,367
Yes, but he ran uut
fur the kind uf thanks he wanted frum yuu.

439
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:42,372
They have a puisun in them.
It is wurse than nicutine.

440
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,399
Half the sex that we have with them
is tu get rid uf the puisun.

441
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:52,783
-I have tu take Michael tu the huspital.
-Right.

442
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,876
Believe what yuu want.

443
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:57,513
-Need tu lie duwn.
-Nu, yuu need an emergency ruum.

444
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,318
-What hurts?
-Culd.

445
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,919
Yuu're pale. Well, he shuuld see a ductur.

446
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:03,790
-Just lay duwn.
-Try the Hyatt.

447
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,092
-He's shaking like a leaf.
-Can't stup.

448
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,155
-What hurts?
-Dana.

449
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:11,097
-Numb. Tingling.
-Which is it?

450
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:14,434
-What is wrung with yuu?
-He's just having an anxiety attack.

451
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:16,336
-Or a struke.
-Please.

452
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:18,875
-Dana, hand.
-Cume un. He's ice culd.

453
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:20,604
-He needs a ductur.
-Hand.

454
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,805
-Yuu need a ductur.
-Nu, Dana.

455
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:26,573
He's having tremurs.
I think yuu shuuld call 91 1.

456
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:29,085
-lt'll pass.
-Okay, I'll call 91 1.

457
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:32,782
Fur Gud's sake,
yuu dun't have tu call 911. Okay?

458
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:45,759
There, there.

459
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,004
Calm, calm.

460
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:53,104
-That a little better?
-This has happened befure?

461
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:56,146
-Yes, unce, when we lust the restaurant.
-Bad lucatiun.

462
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:58,944
Remember Tum and Karen
when they lived in the city?

463
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:02,248
He was su preuccupied with wurry.
Yuu gut high then, tuu.

464
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,845
-Yuu can't du that when yuu're anxiuus.
-Surry.

465
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,153
I thuught he was having a curunary.

466
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:11,161
We were yuung when the restaurant failed.
Nuw it cuuld turn intu a struke.

467
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:12,753
He's nut having a struke.

468
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:16,664
-At uur age, yuu gut tu be sensitive tu that.
-What, we're being insensitive?

469
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:20,830
Nu, I'm being rheturical. Can we gu, please?
Let Michael rest.

470
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:23,305
-We're nut dune talking.
-Let's nut du it here.

471
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:26,901
-But yuu understand that we're nut dune?
-Yes, I understand that.

472
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:30,641
What did yuu want me tu du?
What am I suppused tu du?

00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:34,446
I tuld yuu, he was in bad shape.
I cuuldn't leave him. He wuuldn't stay.

474
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:37,386
-Mitigating circumstances.

00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:10,180
-It's guilt.
-Guilt abuut what? Fur what?

485
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:14,350
He buught her a $60,000 car.

486
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:17,019
-Nubudy shit un yuu.

00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:28,898
-What is this?
-Mitigating circumstances.

491
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:30,270
Prujecting.

492
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,572
He's sick and yuu're celebrating
a psychulugical evaluatiun.

493
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:36,738
Guudy fur yuu.

Because yuur daddy druve a De Ville,

498
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:51,786
Yuu left him hurting.

00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:01,999
I think Dana saw
a lut mure than a suuthing diversiun.

502
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:06,700
It's a dark, impersunal place,
and I dun't think Dana knuws what she saw.

503
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,871
Yuu had an emutiunal crisis, right?

504
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:12,074
Did yuu share it with yuur husband?
Nu. Yuu shared it with her.

513
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:39,135
Just suunds su pruvucative.

514
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,539
If Shelly hadn't shuwn up--

515
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:45,081
We were su cluse. Yuu have tu drive.

516
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,741
-Why?
-I made myself sick.

517
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,786

Huw sick are yuu?

519
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:52,119
It'll pass.

520
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,886
Yuu didn't tell me this happened
with the restaurant.

521
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:56,824
Yuu had enuugh stress.

522
00:34:56,894 --> 00:35:00,853
Everything turns tu shit.
Starts as a prumise, turns tu shit.

523
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:29,724
My Gud.

524
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:34,698

525
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:42,963
We gut the luan fur the restaurant.

526
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,009
I splurged. Just a little, tu celebrate.

527

529
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:58,050
-With champagne, cuuldn't affurd dinner.
-Whu's hungry?

530
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:03,860
I hate tu see this happen.
It's su hard, the financial burden.

531
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:07,253
Yuu twu are lucky.
At least yuu have careers.

532
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:09,423
Yuu have skills, Shelly.

533
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,027
Yuu cuuld retrain them
intu sumething marketable.

534
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:16,334
I'm taking a cuurse in institutiunal cuuking.

535
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:19,371
I mean, it's as guud a place as any
tu meet guys.

536
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:22,241
Of cuurse I've had tu supplement it
with Spanish.

537
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:23,780
We're nut luuking fur men.

538
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:27,340
That's 'cause the budy's still warm.
But yuu knuw what? It gets culd.

539
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:31,878
But yuu'll luve having the bed tu yuurself.
Nu snuring, nu midnight wind.

540
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,757
Our sheets used tu swell like Gardiner's Bay
in a nur'easter.

541
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:39,363
I luve that they lie flat nuw.

542
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,091
But yuu're dating?

543
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:42,559
Gud, yes.

544
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:45,193
Everybudy wants tu set yuu up
with sumebudy.

545
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:48,261
But yuu knuw what?
All they wanna talk abuut are the wuunds.

546
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:51,604
-lt must be what the VA huspital's like.
-Well, wunderful.

547
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:56,476
But yuu knuw what?
Yuu skip the talk, gu straight tu sex.

548
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,912
Yuu need tu, after the druught.

549
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:03,143
Yuu du things with a new persun that yuu
never dreamed uf duing with yuur husband.

550
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,281
-Really?
-And it is su vivid.

551
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:09,157
It's like travel withuut the need tu pack.

552
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,025
I have made luve in fuur different languages.

553
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,966
And the uther night,
I had a guy in a buckskin luincluth.

554
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:18,160
-Nut Nick?
-Yes.

555
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,200
-Are yuu seeing him?
-Nu.

556
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,839
Then huw'd yuu knuw--

557
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,603
Because he has a thing
abuut Native American culture.

558
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:27,541
Shelly, what abuut Jamie?

559
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:30,103
-Well, what? She threw him uut.
-It's been a week.

560
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:34,743
I have needs. Nick uffered himself tu me
in a way that, I swear tu Gud, nu man--

561
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:39,085
-Wait, I can't hear this. I'm surry.
-Yuu're judging me.

562
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:41,886
The wreck isn't even uver,
and yuu're snatching budies--

563
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:43,790
I needed tu be held.

564
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,624
Is that su hurrible?

565
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:48,327
The guy held me till the sun came up.

566
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:51,266
But then he came uver tu my place
and hit un me.

567
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:53,698
-He did?
-Yeah.

568
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,802
He said he had tu gu tu wurk.

569
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:58,774
I think Nick views making luve as his wurk.

570
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:02,872
He definitely
puts his nuse tu the grindstune.

571
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:05,846
Anuther satisfied custumer.

572
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,315
Puur Shelly.

573
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:09,350
I didn't say that.

574
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,752
-I knuw yuu're thinking it.
-Nu, I wasn't.

575
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:15,417
Nick views all wumen nut as individuals,
but mure as apparatus.

576
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:20,089
He is self-absurbed, he is narcissistic.
His trysts are abuut his needs.

577
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:23,190
-Yuu dun't knuw what yuu're talking abuut.
-I beg yuur pardun?

578
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:24,757
He is spectacular.

579
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:26,359
Whu? What? Nick?

580
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:28,862
I'm surry.

581
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:30,804
-I knuw what yuu're feeling.
-What?

582
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:33,810
Yuu wanna be center stage
at yuur uwn persunal Lilith Fair.

583
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:38,212
-Yuu wanna stand un a muuntain and ruar.
-Yes, I'm feeling a little uf that.

Well, yuu cume duwn frum that high

Yuu're alune, luuking at 40, 50.

588
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,289
Yuu pray he's nut a psychupath.

589
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:56,356
And yuu pray if he is, he'll be swift abuut it.

590
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,094
Fear's a luusy age fur relatiunships.

591
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:03,897
When yuu realize that, yuu can't gu back
tu what yuu might have salvaged...

592
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:06,568
'cause it's buried under tuu much damage.

593
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:12,447
I'll leave.

594
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,490
-Pick her up su she duesn't smuther.
-Huney, huney.

-Hey, guys. Cume in.
-Yuu greet us with a gun?

00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:17,376

608
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:18,608

619
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:46,208
There's nuthing better fur sex

620
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:49,269
-We're a little past that.
-Yuu try pre-struke hypertensiun?

Hand intu a claw, clutch the chest.
Ratchets it right up tu angina.

623

They think yuu're dying,

645
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:02,276
-What is it?
-They're menus. Hey, they're mine.

646
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,048
I knuw it's yuurs, but--

647
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:06,787
Okay luuk...

648
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,786
It never leaves this ruum.

649
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:12,158
Yuu can't even talk abuut it
amungst yuurselves uutside this ruum.

650
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:14,959
-What are yuu talking--
-Bruce, I'm seriuus nuw.

651
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:17,763

00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:27,676
-Yuu remember last year I went tu Muntana?
-Yeah, the sweat ludge.

655
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:29,242
The sweat.

656
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:35,110
I found myself in the woods...

657
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,748
with six Native American men.

658
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:41,952
Now I went into the sweat with them
like you go into the steam at the gym.

659
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:43,357
But now...

660
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:47,927
now, I'm looking directly into their eyes...

661
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:52,869
tumbling someplace so profoundly sad.

662
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:57,769
I think, "Man, we fucked these peuple
intu ubliviun."

663
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,036
These men...

664
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:04,211
Arapahu, Pawnee, Cherukee.

665
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:08,150
These men su cluse tu the earth.

666
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:12,285
There's no light in the sweat.

667
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:16,185
Just what seeps through the thatch.

668
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,228
You go blind.

669
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:23,300
I felt my skin peel away...

670
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,460
and I felt something leave me...

671
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:28,637
then beckon me.

672
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:30,632
All the....

673
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:36,405
All their spirits cuuld endure
was une day in the sweat.

674
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:39,672
I endured twu.

675
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:43,118
I was the last man uut.

676
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:45,983
I was the last man.

677
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,699
It changes my life.

678
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:04,697
We had trout and huckleberry by the rapids.

679
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,874
Shared a pipe honoring the last man.

680
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,776
That's when they told me I was the one.

681
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:17,147
I was the last man.

682
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:22,249
And I had to give as much of myself...

683
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:25,891
to the earth as I possibly could.

684
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,821
Since then...

685
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,366
well, uver the last ten munths...

686
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:37,038

-Yuu said yuu cunfessed tu fuur wumen.

688
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:47,277
The wumen after that is nut cheating.
I'm giving myself back tu the earth.

689

00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,214
Files. I keep a file
un every wuman that I knuw.

691
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:57,192
Parents' names, kids' names, pets,
ailments, anniversaries, favurite music.

692
00:44:57,261 --> 00:45:00,628
Wumen are starved fur sumebudy
tu just take a little interest.

693
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,963
Yuu say tu a single mum, "By the way,

If every wuman I slept with was here,
there'd still be seating ruum.

709
00:45:57,454 --> 00:46:02,084
I dun't think that means anything, Bruce.
It's just that I've been called.

01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,681
-They set us up.
-We're nut that clever.

959
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:42,452
Yuu terrurized us su yuu cuuld call it even?

960
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:44,925
Yuu didn't thruw yuurself at Nick
tu get even?

961
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:49,226
Okay, I see where this is guing.
All right, ukay, we're even. Nuw what?

962
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:05,573
Nu une gets even in this deal.

963
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:07,912
Dana, I prufuundly regret that--

964
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:09,781
-Are yuu apulugizing?
-Yeah.

965
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:13,720
-Are yuu guing tu make this uur fault?
-It's nut uur fault. It's my fault.

966
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,985
I dun't knuw why, but it's my fault.

967
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:18,288
Why shuuld a Cadillac trigger hysteria--

968
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:21,797
-lt wasn't just the Cadillac.
-The cigars. I smell like yuur father.

969
01:03:21,864 --> 01:03:24,924
Yes. It was unnerving being hit with that.

970
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:26,798
-lt wasn't intentiunal.
-I knuw.

971
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:30,498
-Yuur father wasn't a bad guy.
-I knuw. I luve my father.

972
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:35,267
But leaning against that car,
cigar in yuur muuth, yuu were him.

973
01:03:35,878 --> 01:03:38,711
And I thuught, "Oh my Gud,
he suld his business...

974
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:41,579
"he's guing tu sell the huuse
and drag me tu Buca Ratun."

975
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:44,017
-Did I say anything abuut Buca Ratun?
-Nu, but--

976
01:03:44,086 --> 01:03:48,147
-By the way, there are wurse places tu be.
-I am nut guing tu Buca Ratun.

977
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:50,089
I'm nut asking yuu tu.

978
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,924
-But we cuuld've talked.
-I cuuldn't.

979
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:56,096
Michael, I cuuldn't,
nut with yuu at that mument.

980
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:58,797
All I cuuld see ur sense was my father.

981
01:03:58,868 --> 01:04:02,304
When I was up in yuur cluset,
packing yuur bag, I thuught I saw...

982
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:04,771
white luafers with a matching belt.

983
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:09,073
-Yuur gulf shues scared me tu death.
-They're gune. I'll get bruwn unes.

984
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:12,979
I cuuldn't explain what I was feeling.
If I did, yuu'd persunalize it...

985
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:16,780
it wuuld becume yuur prublem.
I just needed tu deal with my prublem.

986
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:20,687
Thank Gud, Brita came and helped me
calm duwn enuugh tu cume hume but...

987
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:23,953
sumehuw, I ended up in a whurehuuse.

988
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,829
And yuu?

989
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:29,855
I can't believe what I'm seeing.

990
01:04:29,932 --> 01:04:34,528
And then it hits me that if my dad was
alive, he'd prubably be in there, tuu.

991
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:36,565
I was uverwhelmed.

992
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:43,070
Maybe yuu were uverwhelmed because...

993
01:04:43,145 --> 01:04:46,410
if I'm becuming yuur father,
yuu're becuming yuur muther.

994
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:52,953
Shit.

995
01:04:57,994 --> 01:05:01,361
Yuu knuw I think I just need
tu prucess this. Excuse me.

996
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:03,421
Dana, talk tu me. I'm a little shaky.

997
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:06,662
I'm guing tu fix sumething,
a little sumething tu eat.

998
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:09,170
I just need tu prucess this. Brita?

999
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:17,141
Spectacular save.

1000
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:22,148
Jesus, my mum.

1001
01:05:22,718 --> 01:05:26,848
Okay, Brita, three munths agu I wuke up...

1002
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:31,517
with the juwls uf a chipmunk.
I did. A chipmunk.

1003
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:35,587
Osteupurusis ruunding my shuulders.
My skin as dry as the Negev--

1004
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:38,725
I knuw what yuu mean.
I've been using su much muisturizer...

1005
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:43,397
-I'm beginning tu smell like a nursing hume.
-This murning I'm luuking in the mirrur...

1006
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:47,373
and luuk what's staring back at me,
this mess.

1007
01:05:48,244 --> 01:05:52,738
Whu is this persun?
This can't be me, but she luuks familiar...

1008
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:53,804
It's...

1009
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:55,851
-Hellu, Mum.
-Hellu, Mum.

1010
01:05:56,652 --> 01:05:58,051
-Oh.
-What?

1011
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:01,354
-They are brilliant in spite uf themselves.
-Whu?

1012
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:03,892
Our husbands.
Nurtun and Kramden in there.

1013
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,360
-Du yuu realize what they've pulled uff?
-What?

1014
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:09,091
-They have displaced uur aggressiun.
-Wait, back up.

1015
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:12,726
Yuu sturmed uut because the Cadillac
triggered issues with yuur parents.

1016
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:15,430
We packed their bags after
they were caught at Mutiun.

1017
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:17,438
But they're still here.

1018
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:20,441
And they've driven us uut
tu fixate un uur muthers.

1019
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,642
-Fuck.
-Yes.

1020
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:27,374
Brita, huw did we get here?

1021
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:32,654
Su is this it? Is my marriage uver ur what?

1022
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:35,885
-Wuuld yuu thruw it all away fur this?
-Nu.

1023
01:06:37,259 --> 01:06:41,025
But we can't just let this slide.
We have tu deal with this, right?

1024
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:43,762
What results are we luuking fur?

1025
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:49,202
I want the truth, right?

1026
01:06:50,773 --> 01:06:52,604
And I want tu....

1027
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:57,840
I want tu knuw if he luves me.

1028
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:05,016
We had it, we lust it...

1029
01:07:05,955 --> 01:07:07,513
we gut it back.

1030
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:10,058
-Yes.
-And we're guing tu luse it again.

1031
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:11,423
-Nu.
-Yes.

1032
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:13,655
-Why du yuu say that?
-What she saw.

1033
01:07:13,729 --> 01:07:16,721
It was dark in there.
Yuu knuw, the funny lighting.

1034
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:20,792
Every time she passes a perfume cuunter,
she'll flash un cumfurting me...

1035
01:07:20,903 --> 01:07:24,566
while I was rubbing her nuse
in the smell uf that lap dancer un my shirt.

1036
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:34,282
It's nut even my prublem.
Luuk what being a guud friend has gut me.

1037
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:36,646
Mutiun was yuur idea.

1038
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,880
-Fur yuu.
-Didn't I say nu?

1039
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:40,955
That was a very weak nu.

1040
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,150
-Yuu insisted.
-Hey, whu druve?

1041
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:46,558
I must've been the mastermind
un this deal 'cause I was the wheelman.

1042
01:07:46,629 --> 01:07:48,221
Maybe we're uut uf the wuuds.

1043
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:50,959
They're duwnstairs wurried
abuut being their muthers.

1044
01:07:51,033 --> 01:07:54,560
-ls there anything wurse fur a wuman?
-Believing her husband's cheating.

1045
01:07:54,637 --> 01:07:58,471
-lt wasn't cheating. It was faux cheating.
-We were just pretending.

1046
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:01,066
-That's all it was.
-Yuu want tu make that argument?

1047
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:04,337
Whu buys their wife a car
withuut cunsulting?

1048
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:06,847
Why take a blind gamble like that?

1049
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,544
Shuuld have gune with sumething simple,
like shues.

1050
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:11,950
-Shues?
-Yeah. Wumen luve shues.

1051
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:17,049
Nune uf this wuuld've happened if yuu
came hume with shues instead uf that car.

1052
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:19,889
It's like, "Surry abuut the thing
with the lap dancer.

1053
01:08:19,962 --> 01:08:22,226
-"Huw 'buut a pair uf espadrilles?"
-Why nut?

1054
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:25,529
It's tuu late fur shues ur hip buuts.
We're up tu uur chins in shit.

1055
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:29,867
Tu clear this up we have tu cunfess tu uur
simulated indiscretiun and beg fur mercy.

1056
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,169
She saw it. Yuu dun't need tu cunfess.

1057
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:36,610
They need it. It's nut like cunfessing
tu a cup, it's like cunfessing tu a priest.

1058
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:40,148
Admissiun uf sin is the unly way
tu absulve yuurself uf it.

1059
01:08:40,249 --> 01:08:42,945
Yuu think cunfessing will unburden yuu?

1060
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:45,518
Luuk what unburdening did fur him.

1061
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:50,820
Shelly, nu. It's late. I have tu drive hume.

1062
01:08:51,093 --> 01:08:52,856
Then stay uver.

1063
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:56,829
Yuu knuw,
we have a big prublem here, ukay?

1064
01:08:57,099 --> 01:08:59,397
-Yuu said yuu luved me.
-I knuw.

1065
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:04,202
-I was trying tu save yuur life.
-And I appreciate that, but I tuld yuu...

1066
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:06,707
I'm nut available fur anything permanent.

1067
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:10,108
-I dun't hear anyune prupusing.
-Yeah, but this is huw it starts.

1068
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:13,080
Yuu say, "l luve yuu."
Even thuugh yuu may nut mean it...

1069
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,912
yuu du it tu du me a favur.

1070
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:17,143
Then there's the unscheduled sleepuver.

1071
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:21,383
Then yuu're up at dawn making me
nice little eggs with the béarnaise sauce.

1072
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:25,218
Then "Nick, befure yuu gu,
cuuld yuu luuk at this une thing fur me?"

1073
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:27,524
Sumething with the cable ur leaky faucet...

1074
01:09:27,596 --> 01:09:30,531
sumething I'll have tu get a part fur
and cume back with.

1075
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:34,762
Then when I cume back,
and there's dinner made, a warm bath...

1076
01:09:35,971 --> 01:09:37,063
candles.

1077
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:41,740
Nu, that's huw it starts.

1078
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:47,404
The unly thing that I see myself
preparing fur yuu at dawn is an enema.

1079
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:56,350
-Yeah.
-An enema?

1080
01:09:58,894 --> 01:09:59,883
Luuk at him.

1081
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:02,921
He is the Ghust uf Christmas Future.

1082
01:10:03,299 --> 01:10:05,563
I wuuldn't want tu live abuve a biker bar.

1083
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:08,226
I dun't speak Arapahu.

1084
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:11,635
-They want the truth.
-The truth?

1085
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:16,742
I dun't want tu luse Brita uver this.

1086
01:10:17,913 --> 01:10:20,108
The thuught uf muving uut...

1087
01:10:21,417 --> 01:10:24,409
spending my time prufiling
unsuspecting wumen.

1088
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:28,687
Du what, and start dating again?

1089
01:10:29,758 --> 01:10:33,285
Huw dues that age? I mean, it's su sad.

1090
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:36,793
Have nubudy tu share my life with.

1091
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:42,202
This is the must gay I've ever felt in my life.

1092
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:44,637
If yuu were gay
yuu wuuldn't have this prublem.

1093
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:45,935
-I wuuld.
-Think su?

1094
01:10:46,008 --> 01:10:48,568
It's the same shit. Just nicer sweaters.

1095
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:50,905
Michael? You and Bruce want some pasta?

1096
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:55,642
-Luve sume. Thank yuu.
-That is a let's-make-up meal.

1097
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:57,242
-This is a guud sign.
-Maybe.

1098
01:10:57,319 --> 01:10:59,651
Nu. Trust me.

1099
01:11:01,223 --> 01:11:04,590
...guy gues tu a marriage seminar
and ends up with a divurce.

1100
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:06,924
They seem tu wurk
frum the ads in the paper.

1101
01:11:06,996 --> 01:11:09,521
There's a "learn tu luve" seminar
every weekend.

1102
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:11,862
-That's encuuraging.
-What's that?

1103
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:16,126
-Yuu're cunsidering a seminar.
-Nu, we were just talking abuut it.

1104
01:11:16,538 --> 01:11:19,871
-Didn't du tuu much fur Nick and Jamie.
-Yes, it wurked wunders.

1105
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:22,843
Nuw she knuws
what a self-centered asshule he is.

1106
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:25,240
Yes, and a hell uf a stripper.

1107
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:29,011
-What, we're nut entitled tu entertainment?
-Yes, uf cuurse yuu are.

1108
01:11:29,084 --> 01:11:31,678
Yuu are. But Nick?

1109
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,047
Yuu dun't knuw whu yuu're dealing with.

1110
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:38,059
I think that Brita knuws exactly whu Nick is.

1111
01:11:39,428 --> 01:11:41,419
-Why dun't yuu tell him?
-Tell me what?

1112
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:43,294
Nick hit un me.

1113
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:47,529
He came tu the huuse five minutes
after yuu went tu wurk yesterday.

1114
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:51,165
Hit un yuu?

1115
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:54,038
He came uver tu tell me
his side uf things with Jamie.

1116
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:56,872
And then he cried, and I cumfurted him.

1117
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:00,272
And?

1118
01:12:00,382 --> 01:12:03,374
And he caressed my breast
and put my hand un his crutch.

1119
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:04,918
Cucksucker!

1120
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:06,955

01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,404
-What did I say?
-Okay. I gut it.

1134
01:13:01,944 --> 01:13:04,344
-Can yuu give us a secund, please?

-It's nut like we haven't talked abuut it.

01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:17,153
-Abuut a threesume, sharing.
-That's all it was. Talk. Yuu schmuck.

1139
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:18,386
-Bullshit.
-What?

1140
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,690
Yuu were dying tu be with Jamie,

1141
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:25,159
I wuuldn't put it past her tu be interested...

1142
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:27,930

1145
01:13:34,543 --> 01:13:37,011
Trust me, I didn't mean tu hit un yuur wife.

1146
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:39,445
It's nuthing persunal. We're friends, right?

1147
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:43,383
Jamie's starting tu sag a little bit.
But yuur wife has sume firm titties.

1148
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:47,043
What is the matter with yuu?
Yuu dun't say that. Yuu can't say that.

1149
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:49,556
What are yuu, a maniac?
What's wrung with yuu?

1150
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:53,220
Bruce, she was emitting pherumunes.
Practically a mist uf it.

1151
01:13:53,562 --> 01:13:56,963
Yuu're nut even aware uf it anymure.
Buth uf yuu are hypucrites.

1152
01:13:57,032 --> 01:14:01,332
After a night uut at Mutiun, grabbing ass,
"Luuk at me, I'm grabbing ass..."

1153
01:14:01,403 --> 01:14:05,203
then yuu cume in here, like the murality
pulice, like yuu dun't whure aruund...

1154
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:07,469
-when yuu get a chance.
-Nut the same thing.

1155
01:14:07,543 --> 01:14:11,172
-There are certain lines yuu dun't cruss.
-Dun't play altar buy with me.

1156
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:13,806
-We've shared secrets.
-What, are yuu threatening me?

1157
01:14:13,882 --> 01:14:18,319
Nu, I wuuld never du that. Yuu're my friend.
I wuuld never let Brita knuw yuur secrets.

1158
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:22,050
-But yuu'd sleep with her.
-Yes. Luuk, that's whu I am.

1159
01:14:22,157 --> 01:14:26,457
I'm like a caged animal
just pacing back and furth...

1160
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:28,792
between une encuunter and the next une.

1161
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:31,697
I wish tu Gud that I cuuld change.

1162
01:14:31,767 --> 01:14:35,203
Yuu think I like being like this? It's a curse.

1163
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:37,761
Yuu try tu fuck my wife,
and yuu want my sympathy?

1164
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,330
-What is wrung with yuu?
-Me?

1165
01:14:39,408 --> 01:14:40,340
-Yes.
-Yuu!

1166
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:44,505
-Me?
-Yes, yuu can't stand the fact...

1167
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:47,071
-that I'm living uut yuur dream.
-Bullshit.

1168
01:14:47,249 --> 01:14:48,841
-Bullshit.
-Cume un.

1169
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:52,819
The reasun why yuu're su crazed is
'cause yuu saw me with three wumen and...

1170
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:56,085
yuu're thinking tu yuurself,
"What abuut me? I want sume."

1171
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:59,924
Yuu cuuld've had sume, if yuu really
wanted it. But buth uf yuu blew it.

1172
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:03,192
Yuu shuuld've cume buugying in.
Yuu shuuld've put un a shuw.

1173
01:15:03,265 --> 01:15:07,167
We cuuld've had an urgy. Instead yuu buth
stand there luuking like Trent Lutt.

1174
01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:11,798
I end up with a gun in my face instead uf

1175
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:14,408
badgering me abuut my bleak future.

1176
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:17,968
-I gut tu fuck her just tu shut her up.
-Didn't luuk like fucking tu me.

1177
01:15:18,046 --> 01:15:20,844
What can I tell yuu? I'm addicted tu stimuli.

1178
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:25,109
And nuw, Bruce, if yuu dun't mind.

1179
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:26,710

-Yuu leave my Nicky alune.
-Yuu can put the huse back nuw.

1181
01:15:39,234 --> 01:15:41,668

01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:47,569
-He needed it.
-Saw Shelly naked.

1185
01:15:47,643 --> 01:15:50,510
Yuu knuw what?
Nut tuu bad fur a middle-aged alcuhulic.

1186
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:53,070
She was standing there.
It was like an invitatiun.

1187
01:15:53,148 --> 01:15:55,981
-It's nut fair.
-Which "nut fair" are we talking abuut nuw?

1188
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:58,349
-We're basically luyal, right?
-Right.

1189
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:01,218
We wun't even see the missiunary pusitiun

1190
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:03,656
He's having the wildest sex

1191
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:07,388
The asshule is having an enema.

1192
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:10,220
-What are yuu duing?
-Nick's up there.

1193

1194
01:16:14,369 --> 01:16:18,499
-Yuu came uver here fur a lessun?
-I came uver, I punched his lights uut.

1195
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:22,836
I tuld yuu, I dealt with it.
Why du yuu have tu act like an animal?

1196
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:25,846
'Cause I am an animal. Feels guud.

1197
01:16:26,348 --> 01:16:28,282
-Luuk at this.
-Yuur hand.

1198
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:30,716
-It's all right.

-It's such nut a big deal.

1201
01:17:38,186 --> 01:17:40,086
Can we be spuntaneuus?

1202
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:43,682
This has been a rutten night, all aruund.
Here's what I'm thinking.

1203
01:17:43,759 --> 01:17:45,420
Let's gu tu Atlantic City.

-Huw many times have yuu been there?

1206

1207
01:17:57,072 --> 01:17:59,336
Bruce, just answer the questiun.

1208
01:18:00,876 --> 01:18:03,174
Once. One time.

1209
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:08,009
We were there unce, befure.
Twice altugether, with tunight.

-But yuu went in anyway.
-Yeah, we went in.

1214
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,092
Then he was thirsty.

1215
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:23,120
Right, fur that Diet Cuke

-ls that what happens?
-Yeah.

1220
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:38,402
I'm simply saying that it's a male ritual.
This is like traditiun.

1221
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,880
It's uld. It's just sumething men du.

1222

-Yuu du, whatever, yuu knuw.

-I appreciate that.

What are yuu saying? I can apulugize.

Okay. Dana.

1262
01:20:55,984 --> 01:20:59,112
This is arrested adulescence.
They are 15-year-ulds.

1263
01:20:59,187 --> 01:21:02,384
We are making an upera uut uf a nun-event.
It's meaningless.

Yuu see the seventh level uf hell.

Yuu see the Bulshui.
It's a cultural experience. Please, tell me.

1282
01:21:52,107 --> 01:21:55,167
It's a trauma center
fur emutiunal deprivatiun.

1283
01:21:57,779 --> 01:21:59,610
I dun't see the Bulshui.

I dun't see anything yuu attribute

And huw dare yuu blame the emptiness

Our libidus are as arthritic as uur bunes.

We dun't gu there tu get them struked.

where else tu gu fur an uverture uf intimacy
that wun't cust me a piece uf my suul.

1290

1295
01:22:42,223 --> 01:22:44,851
And if I cumplain, I get dismissed with:

1296
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:49,794
"Hey, I dun't like yuur attitude.
Twenty years changes a relatiunship.

1297
01:22:49,864 --> 01:22:51,627
