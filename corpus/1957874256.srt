1
00:01:12,563 --> 00:01:16,889
<i>This is the cross section of the brain
of the protagonist of our story.</i>

2
00:01:17,092 --> 00:01:20,647
<i>Normal brain metabolic activity
is shown in red,</i>

3
00:01:20,804 --> 00:01:24,063
<i>green blue shows
abnormaly low metabolism.</i>

4
00:01:24,148 --> 00:01:25,923
<i>Lack of metabolic activity,</i>

5
00:01:25,947 --> 00:01:29,914
<i>as indicated by low uptake
of Fludeoxyglucose</i>

6
00:01:29,963 --> 00:01:33,169
<i>is caused by shrinkage
in the frontal lobes.</i>

7
00:01:34,084 --> 00:01:36,885
<i>Although our protagonist
does not know it yet,</i>

8
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:39,427
<i>his brain is dying.</i>

9
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,636
Man: Every year at this time,
it is my pleasure…

10
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,620
an honor, really…
to introduce

11
00:01:47,787 --> 00:01:50,789
former deputy station chief, Beirut,

12
00:01:50,926 --> 00:01:52,885
Chief of Station Kabul,

13
00:01:53,275 --> 00:01:55,610
holder of the Donovan Award,

14
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:57,981
the Distinguished Intelligence Medal

15
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,366
and the only living recipient
of the Intelligence Star:

16
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,055
Evan Lake. Evan.

17
00:02:05,362 --> 00:02:07,293
What the hell are you doing?

18
00:02:07,925 --> 00:02:10,077
What the hell are you doing here?

19
00:02:10,896 --> 00:02:12,605
Haven't you heard?

20
00:02:13,177 --> 00:02:16,106
The CIA fell from the Berlin Wall

21
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,907
and all the president's men
can't put it back together again!

22
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,231
It's broke!

23
00:02:23,603 --> 00:02:24,903
What…

24
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:26,038
I…

25
00:02:26,094 --> 00:02:27,394
need…

26
00:02:27,446 --> 00:02:28,746
to do.

27
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:30,614
Not reliable.
Not trustworthy.

28
00:02:30,638 --> 00:02:32,555
Can't stand up to the White House.

29
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,710
Backstabbers.

30
00:02:34,734 --> 00:02:36,788
Watching porn, tapping phones.

31
00:02:38,495 --> 00:02:39,902
What is his name?

32
00:02:39,995 --> 00:02:43,821
What in the name of
Jesus Christ nailed to the cross…

33
00:02:43,845 --> 00:02:45,638
…are you doing here?

34
00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:49,349
…are you doing here?

35
00:02:53,356 --> 00:02:55,096
Because you heard the call.

36
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,455
That's why.

37
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,358
And it was the call of duty

38
00:02:58,382 --> 00:02:59,949
and love of country.

39
00:02:59,973 --> 00:03:01,766
For some it was adventure.

40
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,029
For some, mystique.

41
00:03:05,062 --> 00:03:09,061
For all, it was 9/11
and you heard the call,

42
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:13,236
because you have values!

43
00:03:14,806 --> 00:03:16,591
Don't listen…

44
00:03:17,095 --> 00:03:18,977
to the TV talking heads,

45
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:21,424
the newspaper know-it-alls,
the Hollywood idiots,

46
00:03:21,448 --> 00:03:23,954
the jackass film stars,

47
00:03:24,241 --> 00:03:26,002
the Biscotti Latte layabouts…

48
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,740
They're background noise,
chatter.

49
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,915
They exist

50
00:03:29,953 --> 00:03:32,389
on the edges of every
endeavour that requires

51
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:36,413
selfless service and loyalty and
deep within their cowardly hearts…

52
00:03:39,242 --> 00:03:40,542
they wish you…

53
00:03:48,736 --> 00:03:50,823
Thanks again, Ev.
We appreciate it.

54
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:52,866
You think they believed a word of it?

55
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,983
- I did.
- You were always an easy touch.

56
00:03:56,012 --> 00:03:58,445
I won't be here next year.
On my way out.

57
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:01,379
What? You're a pup.
What are you, 40?

58
00:04:01,403 --> 00:04:03,381
Got an offer
from the private sector.

59
00:04:03,405 --> 00:04:04,705
You'll miss it.

60
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,441
Maybe I'll come back next year
just to hear your speech.

61
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:43,026
When I started riding a desk,
it was supposed to be temporary.

62
00:07:43,056 --> 00:07:44,928
That was six years ago.

63
00:07:45,144 --> 00:07:47,897
You've made your country proud.

64
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:53,066
I've gone through all the proper
channels, I've submitted the paperwork,

65
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,133
but I can't seem to reach anyone.

66
00:07:55,157 --> 00:07:57,381
And I am sorry to bother you with this.

67
00:07:58,167 --> 00:08:00,650
How long have you been
in government service?

68
00:08:01,866 --> 00:08:04,228
Marines six years. Agency 30.

69
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,592
SIS three, 36 years,

70
00:08:07,616 --> 00:08:09,651
last three years at medium pay.

71
00:08:09,675 --> 00:08:10,975
That's…

72
00:08:11,274 --> 00:08:13,387
that's 110,000 a year.

73
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:15,365
Hell, I'd retire for that much.

74
00:08:16,652 --> 00:08:18,141
I doubt that, sir.

75
00:08:22,663 --> 00:08:25,556
I have skills
better deployed in the field.

76
00:08:44,118 --> 00:08:45,418
Come in.

77
00:08:47,825 --> 00:08:49,125
Milt.

78
00:08:49,214 --> 00:08:50,601
Wanna grab lunch?

79
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:51,925
Not today.

80
00:08:52,953 --> 00:08:54,253
How'd it go?

81
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,899
Not so good.

82
00:08:55,923 --> 00:08:59,037
Director said he's going
to see what he can do.

83
00:09:00,512 --> 00:09:01,591
You all right?

84
00:09:01,615 --> 00:09:05,325
Gotta tamper down,
get it under control.

85
00:09:05,349 --> 00:09:07,831
Hey, put that dictionary on my hand.

86
00:09:08,171 --> 00:09:10,835
It's that book over there,
the orange one. It's a dictionary.

87
00:09:10,859 --> 00:09:13,562
Thanks. I know what a dictionary is.

88
00:09:15,132 --> 00:09:16,432
You know,

89
00:09:16,786 --> 00:09:19,686
there are two kinds
of people in this world:

90
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:22,226
men of action and everyone else.

91
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,150
Fuck!

92
00:09:57,187 --> 00:09:59,227
All the indications
pointed that direction,

93
00:09:59,251 --> 00:10:01,260
but it wasn't until
the PET scan was complete

94
00:10:01,284 --> 00:10:02,620
that we could be sure.

95
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,135
So, no more memory tests?

96
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,190
Just the opposite.

97
00:10:05,214 --> 00:10:07,126
Mental exercises
are shown to be effective…

98
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:10,261
All right, what is it?
Eight years and I'm dead?

99
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,493
Mr. Ruchowski,

100
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:14,021
let me repeat,

101
00:10:14,123 --> 00:10:15,803
this is not Alzheimer's.

102
00:10:16,488 --> 00:10:18,484
For many years,
frontotemporal dementia

103
00:10:18,508 --> 00:10:20,577
and Alzheimer's were confused, but

104
00:10:20,935 --> 00:10:23,389
frontotemporal dementia
is a separate disease.

105
00:10:24,796 --> 00:10:26,096
It's better?

106
00:10:27,685 --> 00:10:30,627
FTD is much more aggressive.

107
00:10:31,252 --> 00:10:32,552
Much more?

108
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:33,965
How much more?

109
00:10:34,816 --> 00:10:37,437
- Did anyone come with you today?
- No.

110
00:10:37,502 --> 00:10:40,601
Family is very important
in a situation like this.

111
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,853
I don't have any brothers and sisters.
No children.

112
00:10:43,956 --> 00:10:45,280
My work is my family.

113
00:10:45,304 --> 00:10:48,840
I've spoken with Dr. Gross, Nathan Gross,
in the Special Care wing.

114
00:10:48,864 --> 00:10:50,606
Now after we're finished,
you'll pay him a visit.

115
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,059
He's expecting you.

116
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,834
Is this frontal… FTD,

117
00:10:54,868 --> 00:10:58,046
is there anything
I should be on the lookout for?

118
00:10:58,602 --> 00:11:01,226
You will be subject to overreactions

119
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,089
or inappropriate reactions,

120
00:11:03,113 --> 00:11:05,623
blank spells. Perhaps
you've noticed this already.

121
00:11:05,647 --> 00:11:09,099
Mood swings,
unreliable sensory perception.

122
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,516
"Unreliable sensory perception."

123
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,484
That's what it's called.

124
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,137
What is prescribed?

125
00:11:16,161 --> 00:11:18,046
Usually serotonin inhibitors…

126
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,986
Zoloft, Paxil…
or antidepressants.

127
00:11:21,388 --> 00:11:23,371
But those are drugs for crazy people,

128
00:11:23,395 --> 00:11:25,679
manic-depressives. That's not me.

129
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:28,194
Okay, let's get that clear.
That's not who I am.

130
00:12:16,566 --> 00:12:17,866
John Randall?

131
00:12:18,145 --> 00:12:19,445
Oh, yes.

132
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:21,621
You are…?
- Charles Ruchowski.

133
00:12:21,645 --> 00:12:23,629
I'm a friend. An acquaintance.

134
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,250
Oh! From the Marine Corps?

135
00:12:25,838 --> 00:12:27,138
Follow me.

136
00:12:32,344 --> 00:12:33,644
John?

137
00:12:34,752 --> 00:12:36,477
John, you have a visitor.

138
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,179
Just pull up a chair.

139
00:12:48,697 --> 00:12:50,454
John, it's Charles.

140
00:12:55,836 --> 00:12:57,629
It's a pleasant day today.

141
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,146
Are you comfortable?

142
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,045
There. Them better?

143
00:13:18,893 --> 00:13:20,577
Would you like me to sing you something?

144
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:24,245
Would you like that?

145
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,978
From the Halls of Montezuma

146
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,667
To the shores of Tripoli

147
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,036
We fight our country's battles

148
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,924
In the air, on land and sea.

149
00:13:41,151 --> 00:13:45,488
First to fight for right and freedom

150
00:13:47,566 --> 00:13:51,095
And to keep our honor clean

151
00:13:53,554 --> 00:13:57,260
We are proud to claim the title

152
00:13:58,794 --> 00:14:02,107
Of United States Marines.

153
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:41,783
Yes?

154
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:42,980
<i>Milton?</i>

155
00:14:43,004 --> 00:14:44,180
Yes.

156
00:14:44,204 --> 00:14:45,998
<i>This is Bob Deacon at NSA.</i>

157
00:14:46,397 --> 00:14:49,768
<i>A while back you put in a watch
for certain chemical compounds.</i>

158
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,147
This is three years ago.

159
00:14:52,171 --> 00:14:54,171
<i>You still interested in that?</i>

160
00:14:54,337 --> 00:14:56,124
- I am.
- Good, something's come up.

161
00:14:56,148 --> 00:14:58,236
Where can I find you?
I'm coming over.

162
00:14:58,383 --> 00:15:00,429
A couple of weeks ago
that flash drive

163
00:15:00,453 --> 00:15:02,936
came into the possession
of the Romanians.

164
00:15:03,596 --> 00:15:06,859
It was water-damaged…
the guy jumped off a bridge.

165
00:15:06,979 --> 00:15:11,258
On it we found Islamic sermons
and medical reports.

166
00:15:11,282 --> 00:15:12,502
That's where you come in.

167
00:15:12,526 --> 00:15:15,439
We ran "Decitabine"
and your request came up.

168
00:15:16,381 --> 00:15:18,528
Who was Abdi Abdikarim?

169
00:15:18,558 --> 00:15:19,870
Kenyan national.

170
00:15:19,894 --> 00:15:22,943
We had some old passport records.
Other than that, nothing.

171
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:27,044
SRI made inquiries, but the
Kenyans weren't all that much help.

172
00:15:27,068 --> 00:15:29,157
Can I have a copy
of the full document?

173
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:30,472
There's over 50 pages.

174
00:15:30,503 --> 00:15:32,921
That's all right.
I'll take it electronically.

175
00:15:51,064 --> 00:15:53,113
Muhammad Banir is alive.

176
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:56,113
They say he's dead…
everybody says he's dead.

177
00:15:56,141 --> 00:15:58,354
Killed in an explosion.
But he's not!

178
00:15:58,378 --> 00:15:59,256
There was a body.

179
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,172
So what?
I didn't see any head.

180
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:04,580
I didn't see Banir's head.

181
00:16:04,969 --> 00:16:06,269
Mr. Lake.

182
00:16:07,256 --> 00:16:10,941
Mr. Lake, if you wish
to return to work at the CIA,

183
00:16:11,385 --> 00:16:14,857
I strongly recommend you put the
matter of Muhammad Banir behind you.

184
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:18,176
This job…

185
00:16:18,955 --> 00:16:20,255
is everything.

186
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:22,949
It's my…

187
00:16:24,056 --> 00:16:25,356
my belief.

188
00:16:51,181 --> 00:16:52,390
Yeah?

189
00:16:52,414 --> 00:16:55,609
<i>Evan, where are you? I've been
trying to reach you. I left messages.</i>

190
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,000
I've been busy.

191
00:16:58,286 --> 00:16:59,667
<i>Something's come up.</i>

192
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:00,339
What?

193
00:17:00,363 --> 00:17:02,603
<i>I don't wanna talk about it
over an open line.</i>

194
00:17:02,628 --> 00:17:04,904
<i>Where are you?
I'll come meet you.</i>

195
00:17:06,407 --> 00:17:08,062
<i>Evan, where are you?</i>

196
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:10,952
<i>Evan, where are you?</i>

197
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:13,306
Diamond Tuesdays.

198
00:17:13,623 --> 00:17:15,303
<i>You're at Ruby Tuesdays?</i>

199
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:18,648
Yes, I'm at Ruby Tuesdays.
That's what I just said.

200
00:17:18,854 --> 00:17:20,808
<i>Okay, which one?</i>

201
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,410
The one in…

202
00:17:24,971 --> 00:17:26,271
Arlington.

203
00:17:41,738 --> 00:17:43,375
- Ev.
- Yeah?

204
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,161
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

205
00:17:47,185 --> 00:17:49,468
Get this man
something to eat, please,

206
00:17:49,508 --> 00:17:50,938
and a cup of coffee.

207
00:17:50,962 --> 00:17:52,262
You got it.

208
00:17:57,648 --> 00:17:59,372
Can I clear that for you?

209
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,110
Hey.

210
00:18:02,195 --> 00:18:04,195
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

211
00:18:09,592 --> 00:18:11,385
That wasn't very sociable.

212
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:13,866
What's going on?

213
00:18:14,598 --> 00:18:15,898
Nothing.

214
00:18:15,979 --> 00:18:17,279
Do you want to talk about it?

215
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,988
What is so goddamn important?

216
00:18:20,453 --> 00:18:22,401
This "something" that has come up.

217
00:18:24,615 --> 00:18:27,421
There's been a possible hit on Banir.

218
00:18:28,612 --> 00:18:31,545
Over the last year,
five requests for Deferiprone

219
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:32,838
which is not too unusual…

220
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,664
No, it doesn't affect the anemia.

221
00:18:34,688 --> 00:18:36,054
It's just the iron deficiency.

222
00:18:36,078 --> 00:18:39,927
Right, but the same source…
the man requesting it was Kenyan,

223
00:18:40,003 --> 00:18:43,560
but the doctor is
in Bucharest University Hospital,

224
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:45,462
a research hospital.

225
00:18:45,486 --> 00:18:48,294
Decitabine and Azacitidine,

226
00:18:48,318 --> 00:18:50,532
which are only used
for clinical trials…

227
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:51,745
Mediterranean anemia.

228
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:54,096
Thalassemia, which is hereditary,

229
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,315
which we know
Muhammad Banir carries,

230
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:58,926
even though
he has been dead for 20 years.

231
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:00,738
You know his father died of it.

232
00:19:00,762 --> 00:19:03,045
And Abdikarim,
the man procuring the drug,

233
00:19:03,069 --> 00:19:06,338
was a suspect in a Nigerian fraud ring.

234
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:10,105
Rather than give himself up,
he jumps off a bridge.

235
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:13,641
Medical info was on a flash drive.

236
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,030
He ain't no Kenyan.

237
00:19:16,536 --> 00:19:19,157
Abdikarim is a fucking raghead name.

238
00:19:19,517 --> 00:19:21,923
What? I got nothing against ragheads.

239
00:19:21,947 --> 00:19:23,169
Except maybe there are too many of them.

240
00:19:23,193 --> 00:19:24,848
He was 100% healthy.

241
00:19:24,941 --> 00:19:25,875
What else?

242
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:27,199
Nothing.

243
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:29,095
I knew he didn't die.

244
00:19:29,229 --> 00:19:32,540
This means his condition
has moved to an advanced stage.

245
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:34,942
Now he can lay low,
he can become invisible,

246
00:19:34,969 --> 00:19:38,279
but sooner or later
the disease will flush him out.

247
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,310
Banir's got it.

248
00:19:41,844 --> 00:19:43,144
It's come out.

249
00:19:44,427 --> 00:19:45,916
It's in his blood.

250
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:51,648
<i>These are the blood cells of the
antagonist of our story.</i>

251
00:19:51,705 --> 00:19:55,468
<i>The red cells suffer from a lack of
hemoglobin and excess of iron.</i>

252
00:19:55,533 --> 00:19:58,177
<i>The symptoms are fatigue, jaundice,</i>

253
00:19:58,201 --> 00:20:00,640
<i>leading to an enlarged spleen
and bone deformity.</i>

254
00:20:00,671 --> 00:20:03,450
<i>Unset, occurs relatively early in life.</i>

255
00:20:03,474 --> 00:20:05,154
<i>There is no known cure.</i>

256
00:21:39,241 --> 00:21:41,437
I've come across intelligence
which leads me to believe…

257
00:21:41,461 --> 00:21:43,141
Muhammad Banir is alive.

258
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:44,138
Go on.

259
00:21:44,162 --> 00:21:46,649
Banir was believed killed
during my extraction.

260
00:21:46,737 --> 00:21:50,095
Not a word about him has been heard
for 22 years… until now.

261
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:53,420
Banir has a hereditary
blood disease, thalassemia.

262
00:21:53,477 --> 00:21:54,969
If not apparent during childhood,

263
00:21:54,993 --> 00:21:56,905
it can lay dormant
until midlife or later.

264
00:21:56,929 --> 00:21:59,622
There have been recent
intercepts of requests

265
00:21:59,646 --> 00:22:03,399
for medicine used primarily
during clinical trials for this anemia.

266
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:09,073
And what's the source
of these intercepts?

267
00:22:09,306 --> 00:22:11,168
The source is confidential.

268
00:22:11,609 --> 00:22:14,281
Lake, I am the director
of the fucking agency.

269
00:22:14,329 --> 00:22:18,091
Nothing is confidential.
Who's the source?

270
00:22:19,601 --> 00:22:23,322
If the source were to become known,
the source would be in danger.

271
00:22:26,577 --> 00:22:30,736
And this is the same Muhammad
Banir who held you captive…

272
00:22:31,353 --> 00:22:32,653
Yes, sir.

273
00:22:34,389 --> 00:22:35,858
What do you propose?

274
00:22:35,882 --> 00:22:37,429
I would like to set up a task force,

275
00:22:37,453 --> 00:22:39,770
establish Banir's whereabouts,
extract him,

276
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:41,836
and have him return
to the United States for trial.

277
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,846
You'd like to set up a task force?

278
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,207
I meant the agency, sir.

279
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:47,322
Why don't we just let the man die?

280
00:22:47,346 --> 00:22:50,451
That is assuming that your
confidential source is correct.

281
00:22:50,475 --> 00:22:53,916
Because it is not
the policy of this agency,

282
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,327
nor is it the policy of this government,

283
00:22:56,407 --> 00:22:58,534
to allow the man who's responsible

284
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:01,552
for at least 17 kidnappings,
a dozen executions

285
00:23:01,576 --> 00:23:03,727
and the bombing of a tourist bus…

286
00:23:03,751 --> 00:23:07,399
to go free simply because he's sick.

287
00:23:14,322 --> 00:23:17,312
Mary, sent in Sanjar.

288
00:23:20,673 --> 00:23:21,973
Come in.

289
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,921
This is Dr. Sanjar.

290
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,219
He's with the Office
of Medical Services.

291
00:23:27,243 --> 00:23:30,053
Please, Evan, sit.

292
00:23:30,087 --> 00:23:33,150
Dr. Sanjar was speaking
at UPenn Hospital,

293
00:23:33,174 --> 00:23:36,060
a conference
on service-related diseases.

294
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:40,062
Did you really think
you could travel 150 miles,

295
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:42,119
make three visits
to a neurological clinic

296
00:23:42,146 --> 00:23:44,008
under a false identity,

297
00:23:44,032 --> 00:23:45,912
give blood, leave fingerprints

298
00:23:45,936 --> 00:23:48,161
and not have us find out about it?

299
00:23:49,034 --> 00:23:51,946
Dr. Clayborne forwarded
your medical records.

300
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:56,390
You don't have to worry about payment
or privacy or quality of care.

301
00:23:56,414 --> 00:23:58,483
The CIA takes care of its own.

302
00:23:58,661 --> 00:24:00,793
The OMS has a state-of-the-art facility.

303
00:24:00,817 --> 00:24:02,791
In addition to which,
we coordinate our efforts

304
00:24:02,815 --> 00:24:04,814
with AFRH here in Washington.

305
00:24:04,838 --> 00:24:07,794
And we'd like to make this
as easy as possible for you.

306
00:24:07,818 --> 00:24:09,607
We've been speaking to the DDO.

307
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,453
We'll have a retirement dinner.

308
00:24:11,477 --> 00:24:13,090
The press… everyone'll come.

309
00:24:13,114 --> 00:24:15,096
Heck, even the president will be there.

310
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,878
Banir.

311
00:24:16,902 --> 00:24:18,619
What about Banir?

312
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:21,099
Muhammad Banir is dead, Lake.

313
00:24:21,123 --> 00:24:23,608
Where did they put my files?
They'll take…

314
00:24:23,632 --> 00:24:25,472
I didn't see Banir's head.

315
00:24:25,496 --> 00:24:28,076
We interviewed
your departmental associates.

316
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,497
We are concerned about these
mood swings you've been suffering,

317
00:24:30,521 --> 00:24:31,866
the unpredictability of behavior.

318
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,008
Fuck you!

319
00:24:33,032 --> 00:24:34,035
Calm down.

320
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:35,731
Banir, damn it.

321
00:24:35,755 --> 00:24:38,924
There is a concern that you could
become a liability to the agency.

322
00:24:38,948 --> 00:24:41,562
- I'm a liability? Fuck you!
- Calm down.

323
00:24:41,586 --> 00:24:43,889
You fucked this up just like
you fucked up everything else.

324
00:24:43,913 --> 00:24:45,787
This is what they give
to assholes like me

325
00:24:45,811 --> 00:24:47,582
who give their lives for their country!

326
00:24:47,606 --> 00:24:49,868
Fucked up Iran-Contra,
fucked up Ames,

327
00:24:49,892 --> 00:24:51,971
fucked up 9/11, fucked up WMD,

328
00:24:51,995 --> 00:24:54,356
Afghanistan, Iraq, Benghazi.

329
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,259
Not you yourself of course, no.

330
00:24:56,283 --> 00:24:58,393
No, you're just the latest
in a long line of fuck-ups

331
00:24:58,417 --> 00:25:02,072
who turned this agency into a cesspool
of politics and special interests

332
00:25:02,096 --> 00:25:04,939
on behalf of the weapons makers
and the surveillance industry,

333
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,473
who get richer while we get weaker.

334
00:25:06,497 --> 00:25:08,633
- Mr. Lake.
- Who put you up to this, huh?

335
00:25:08,657 --> 00:25:11,440
Whose got their hand in your pocket now?

336
00:25:11,464 --> 00:25:13,499
You've got your head
so far up Obama's ass,

337
00:25:13,523 --> 00:25:15,989
you can't see anything
except his shit anymore.

338
00:25:16,013 --> 00:25:17,313
Shame on you.

339
00:25:18,328 --> 00:25:20,018
Shame on you.

340
00:25:29,224 --> 00:25:31,831
The medication has not arrived.

341
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:33,608
It should have been here.

342
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,632
I sent an email to Abdikarim.

343
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:38,557
It didn't get through.
- Hmm.

344
00:25:38,941 --> 00:25:40,241
So…

345
00:25:41,036 --> 00:25:45,304
what… do you… propose,
huh, doctor?

346
00:25:46,735 --> 00:25:48,035
Ehm.

347
00:25:49,566 --> 00:25:51,637
Huh, doctor?

348
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,469
I have your stuff.

349
00:26:52,493 --> 00:26:53,246
I…

350
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:56,213
I hope you don't mind.
I didn't want to leave it there.

351
00:26:56,977 --> 00:26:58,277
Can I come in?

352
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,599
Yeah, come in.

353
00:27:02,702 --> 00:27:04,002
Thanks.

354
00:27:13,895 --> 00:27:16,378
Do you… want something to drink?

355
00:27:16,754 --> 00:27:18,189
What are you having?

356
00:27:18,213 --> 00:27:20,393
- Sake.
- Sounds good.

357
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,904
I screwed up pretty bad today, huh?

358
00:27:36,249 --> 00:27:37,549
No going back.

359
00:27:38,434 --> 00:27:40,710
So much for the retirement party.

360
00:27:40,818 --> 00:27:43,349
They're not gonna do nothing about Banir.

361
00:27:43,977 --> 00:27:47,155
They treated me
like I was some sort of crackpot.

362
00:27:50,095 --> 00:27:51,395
Kanpai.

363
00:27:51,429 --> 00:27:53,290
- Kanpai.
- Have a seat.

364
00:27:59,923 --> 00:28:02,215
That's the other reason I came.

365
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:06,746
NSA forwarded a copy
of Abdi's flash drive.

366
00:28:06,824 --> 00:28:11,566
The prescribing physician is
Dr. Iulian Cornel, medical research.

367
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,445
That's why none of
the indicators went off.

368
00:28:13,469 --> 00:28:16,581
- How long has this been happening?
- Two years.

369
00:28:18,504 --> 00:28:19,804
Banir…

370
00:28:20,139 --> 00:28:21,033
Well…

371
00:28:21,057 --> 00:28:22,357
Possible Banir…

372
00:28:23,123 --> 00:28:25,344
uses Abdikarim as a middleman.

373
00:28:25,376 --> 00:28:29,171
Their communications,
any information about possible Banir…

374
00:28:29,195 --> 00:28:31,373
Goes into the river…

375
00:28:32,155 --> 00:28:33,877
or so he thinks.

376
00:28:34,405 --> 00:28:39,234
And Abdi pays Dr. Cornel.

377
00:28:49,778 --> 00:28:51,078
Evan.

378
00:28:54,568 --> 00:28:55,868
Ignorant…

379
00:28:56,433 --> 00:28:58,988
ignorant doctor in this?

380
00:29:00,211 --> 00:29:01,988
Well, except for one thing.

381
00:29:02,012 --> 00:29:04,803
Dr. Cornel has a Kenyan wife.

382
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:06,127
Ah.

383
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,324
How much does he charge?

384
00:29:08,348 --> 00:29:10,890
10k euro every month.

385
00:29:10,914 --> 00:29:12,318
- And doesn't report it.
- Nope.

386
00:29:12,342 --> 00:29:14,104
Now we're on the same page.

387
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:17,438
The doctor's protecting himself.
You got the files?

388
00:29:48,758 --> 00:29:50,331
I want you to go…

389
00:29:51,302 --> 00:29:52,626
go to Bucharest.

390
00:29:52,909 --> 00:29:55,666
Find this… doctor.

391
00:29:56,036 --> 00:29:57,498
Get the medication.

392
00:30:01,707 --> 00:30:03,583
Shave your beard.

393
00:30:04,742 --> 00:30:07,954
Get European ways.

394
00:30:17,776 --> 00:30:19,036
Better idea.

395
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,570
Get this Cornel to come here.

396
00:30:23,101 --> 00:30:25,831
He will be my new doctor now this…

397
00:30:26,151 --> 00:30:28,912
Wangari doesn't have the experience.

398
00:30:37,816 --> 00:30:39,116
Here he is.

399
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:44,034
"Dr. Iulian Cornel"

400
00:30:44,064 --> 00:30:48,352
"Grant to develop novel
therapeutic agents: b-thalassemia."

401
00:30:48,376 --> 00:30:51,384
"Sponsor:
Cooley's Anemia Foundation."

402
00:30:51,408 --> 00:30:52,707
Bingo.

403
00:30:52,731 --> 00:30:56,418
Muhammad Banir,
you think you can hide?

404
00:30:56,616 --> 00:30:59,091
Nobody can hide from the reaper.

405
00:31:01,347 --> 00:31:02,647
Can we get in?

406
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:04,791
Into what?

407
00:31:04,815 --> 00:31:07,781
Into the correspondence
between Banir and the doctor.

408
00:31:07,805 --> 00:31:09,874
Cornel hasn't heard from Abdi…

409
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,330
so now he's wondering…

410
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:14,339
"Where's my payment?"

411
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,052
It… it's possible, but…

412
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:19,376
But what?

413
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:23,075
If this med is for Banir,

414
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,560
why hasn't anyone heard
from him in 20 years?

415
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:26,884
I can explain.

416
00:31:28,021 --> 00:31:32,277
Banir thought I had an asset
in his group, a double.

417
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:34,524
That's what he was trying
to get me to give up.

418
00:31:34,548 --> 00:31:36,172
There was no fucking asset.

419
00:31:36,196 --> 00:31:39,583
I couldn't give it up even if I wanted,
but that was the deal.

420
00:31:39,937 --> 00:31:42,937
After my extraction, I had my doubts,

421
00:31:42,961 --> 00:31:47,102
so I sent some intelligence hinting
that Banir himself was the double,

422
00:31:47,215 --> 00:31:50,291
a cable that would be intercepted
at the highest levels.

423
00:31:50,315 --> 00:31:54,089
If he was still alive,
I wanted him off the playing field.

424
00:31:54,411 --> 00:31:56,342
I drove him into the ground.

425
00:31:58,659 --> 00:32:00,728
Everybody figured he was dead.

426
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:02,805
I had my doubts.

427
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,115
Why?

428
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:06,152
Because he's a true believer.

429
00:32:06,256 --> 00:32:08,229
Guys like that don't just die.

430
00:32:08,253 --> 00:32:11,940
You gotta… you gotta rip out
their hearts with your bare hands.

431
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,023
You've been giving this
a lot of thought, haven't you?

432
00:32:15,047 --> 00:32:16,371
Just once a day.

433
00:32:16,782 --> 00:32:18,796
- Every day.
- All day long.

434
00:32:25,334 --> 00:32:26,921
Don't answer it.

435
00:32:35,863 --> 00:32:36,741
Shit.

436
00:32:36,765 --> 00:32:38,420
Uh, just stay there.

437
00:32:42,145 --> 00:32:44,820
Dr. Sanjar, I'm real busy
right now. I don't have the time.

438
00:32:44,844 --> 00:32:47,448
Evan, I don't want to leave it
the way it was left today.

439
00:32:47,472 --> 00:32:48,555
It was not right.

440
00:32:48,579 --> 00:32:50,390
- It's all right.
- No, it's not.

441
00:32:50,921 --> 00:32:53,556
I'm not going to let you
push this aside.

442
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,123
We want to help you.

443
00:32:55,327 --> 00:32:57,940
Come to my office,
we'll sit down, have a talk,

444
00:32:58,006 --> 00:32:59,579
prepare for the future.

445
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:01,905
It doesn't have to be tomorrow.
Whenever you like.

446
00:33:02,348 --> 00:33:03,648
Agreed?

447
00:33:04,307 --> 00:33:05,892
Yeah. Agreed.

448
00:33:06,713 --> 00:33:07,907
I'll see you then.

449
00:33:07,931 --> 00:33:09,231
See you then.

450
00:33:11,635 --> 00:33:14,036
You gonna tell me
what that was about?

451
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,897
Nothing. Let's get drunk.

452
00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:20,452
This goes back to when I found
you at Ruby Tuesdays, doesn't it?

453
00:33:20,536 --> 00:33:22,536
Can't a man have any privacy?

454
00:33:22,952 --> 00:33:25,340
All right, look,
I'm risking my job here,

455
00:33:25,364 --> 00:33:27,392
but you've got
another program running,

456
00:33:27,416 --> 00:33:29,761
something you won't tell me about.

457
00:33:29,854 --> 00:33:33,166
You gotta be straight.
You owe me that much.

458
00:33:52,046 --> 00:33:53,509
Happy?

459
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,396
It's not so bad now…

460
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,041
little things,
things that I can hide, but…

461
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:04,093
that's a train
that only runs one way.

462
00:34:05,013 --> 00:34:06,313
Everything up here?

463
00:34:07,036 --> 00:34:08,336
Rotting.

464
00:34:08,937 --> 00:34:11,576
Bit by bit, it slips away.

465
00:34:11,756 --> 00:34:13,903
- You've known this…
- I suspected.

466
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:17,005
About a year ago,
something in my head just…

467
00:34:17,626 --> 00:34:18,926
fell.

468
00:34:19,211 --> 00:34:21,076
By the time you start
showing symptoms,

469
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,524
the atrophy's done its damage.

470
00:34:22,548 --> 00:34:25,200
You know, I wanna know something.
Were they asking about me?

471
00:34:26,276 --> 00:34:29,956
Uh, not to me directly, but yeah.

472
00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:32,338
You're angry?
- Not at them.

473
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:35,372
Well, actually, maybe at them,
but this whole damn thing.

474
00:34:35,396 --> 00:34:37,521
Why me? Why the fuck me?

475
00:34:37,546 --> 00:34:38,983
I didn't do anything wrong!

476
00:34:39,007 --> 00:34:43,506
Wasn't like I was butt-fucking chimps in
the asshole in the Congo and invented AIDS.

477
00:34:43,537 --> 00:34:46,109
You still have time left.

478
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:48,493
Make the most of it.

479
00:34:48,861 --> 00:34:53,384
Why waste it looking for someone
who may not even exist?

480
00:34:53,408 --> 00:34:55,471
He does exist.

481
00:34:55,502 --> 00:34:57,461
There is a window here.

482
00:34:57,774 --> 00:35:00,805
It won't be open long,
then it will close,

483
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:03,214
and Banir will have
gotten away with it.

484
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:07,236
And I am gonna do something
worth remembering

485
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,668
with what's left of my time.

486
00:35:31,888 --> 00:35:34,715
It's programmed to
the number I was given.

487
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:40,066
The money came in.

488
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:44,702
10,000 euros, Abdi's account.

489
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,659
You have cash?

490
00:35:46,851 --> 00:35:48,151
Yes.

491
00:35:49,557 --> 00:35:52,256
And no one to pick it up.
Shit, I gotta hurry.

492
00:35:52,288 --> 00:35:53,866
You go to Romania?

493
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,969
- Do you have…
- Don't tell me anything.

494
00:35:55,993 --> 00:35:57,293
I know nothing.

495
00:35:57,372 --> 00:35:59,345
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.

496
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:01,401
I owe you. You saved me.

497
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:02,915
Do you have a gun?

498
00:36:03,925 --> 00:36:05,225
In the trunk.

499
00:36:06,181 --> 00:36:09,078
We'll need at least three sets,
all vetted.

500
00:36:09,187 --> 00:36:11,977
- How long for the IDs?
- Two days, maybe three.

501
00:36:12,001 --> 00:36:13,310
What if I say no?

502
00:36:13,334 --> 00:36:15,783
Well then, Mr. Secret Agent Man,

503
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:18,221
I might have to drop a dime on you.

504
00:36:19,673 --> 00:36:22,018
You know,
I half believe you would.

505
00:36:28,764 --> 00:36:31,601
Have you clarified your plan?

506
00:36:32,271 --> 00:36:35,059
There's a woman meeting us in Bucharest.

507
00:36:35,091 --> 00:36:38,392
Oh. You are full of surprises.

508
00:36:38,417 --> 00:36:41,529
Michelle Zubarain,
used to be a journalist,

509
00:36:41,553 --> 00:36:43,887
Mid-East danger junkie.

510
00:36:44,066 --> 00:36:46,608
Might even have been an agent.

511
00:36:46,632 --> 00:36:48,563
She works out of Prague now.

512
00:36:48,588 --> 00:36:50,653
She an old flame?

513
00:36:50,677 --> 00:36:52,849
Just someone I used to know.

514
00:36:54,121 --> 00:36:55,275
And?

515
00:36:55,299 --> 00:36:58,238
Just, you know, one step at a time.

516
00:36:58,631 --> 00:37:01,097
Seeing what'll happen next.

517
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:16,064
Professor Dr. Iulian Cornel.

518
00:37:17,473 --> 00:37:20,178
Nothing particularly
stands out about him.

519
00:37:20,306 --> 00:37:22,995
Keeps a low profile, community service,

520
00:37:23,415 --> 00:37:25,277
sits on a couple of boards.

521
00:37:26,268 --> 00:37:27,568
The wife?

522
00:37:27,804 --> 00:37:30,230
 Angena? They met
through an aid program.

523
00:37:30,298 --> 00:37:32,355
- Where?
- Mombasa.

524
00:37:34,538 --> 00:37:36,104
- Sir.
- What?

525
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,343
This is a nonsmoking section.

526
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,481
Let me just check something.

527
00:37:42,618 --> 00:37:44,093
Yup, I am in Romania.

528
00:37:44,126 --> 00:37:47,219
Are you out of your fucking mind?
This whole country is a smoking section.

529
00:37:47,243 --> 00:37:47,958
Evan.

530
00:37:47,982 --> 00:37:49,602
There is a smoking area upstairs.

531
00:37:49,626 --> 00:37:51,719
Just when did you start
having nonsmoking sections?

532
00:37:51,743 --> 00:37:54,109
Smoking is mandatory here. Look.

533
00:37:55,723 --> 00:37:57,975
- See? - Concentrate.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

534
00:37:57,999 --> 00:37:59,823
I'm putting it out.

535
00:38:00,282 --> 00:38:01,582
Jesus.

536
00:38:03,209 --> 00:38:06,122
Thank you for bringing
that to our attention.

537
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:10,856
I'm sorry, Michelle. I'm sorry
about that. It's the jet lag.

538
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,501
It's got me…
it's got me turned around.

539
00:38:15,492 --> 00:38:16,727
It's all right.

540
00:38:16,751 --> 00:38:19,648
What's the best way
to approach Dr. Cornel?

541
00:38:20,353 --> 00:38:22,836
In his office during business hours,

542
00:38:23,254 --> 00:38:25,668
closed door,
with colleagues nearby.

543
00:38:26,354 --> 00:38:28,560
I've prepared an official cover.

544
00:38:28,747 --> 00:38:30,047
Not tomorrow.

545
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,244
The day after.
- Okay.

546
00:38:32,903 --> 00:38:34,203
I'll be ready by then.

547
00:38:37,498 --> 00:38:39,567
How did you and Michelle meet?

548
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:41,884
If I'm not being too forward.

549
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,730
No, it's not too forward. It just…

550
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,246
wasn't…

551
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:48,268
particularly glamorous.

552
00:38:49,681 --> 00:38:52,629
How did you and Evan meet?
That's more interesting.

553
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,182
I was an asset.

554
00:38:56,358 --> 00:38:59,049
The agency just stepped back.

555
00:38:59,078 --> 00:39:01,280
Then Evan Lake showed up.

556
00:39:01,304 --> 00:39:03,834
Two days later I was
on a plane back to Washington.

557
00:39:03,858 --> 00:39:08,179
They just needed to be reminded
we take care of our own.

558
00:39:12,437 --> 00:39:14,117
I was a believer then.

559
00:39:16,641 --> 00:39:18,848
I've gotta get back to the room.

560
00:39:19,578 --> 00:39:22,129
This flight really took it out of me.

561
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:28,313
I'll see you later.

562
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,303
Did you have to say that?

563
00:39:36,836 --> 00:39:38,491
Did I embarrass you?

564
00:39:38,636 --> 00:39:39,936
No.

565
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:42,095
You couldn't embarrass me.

566
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:47,326
When are you going to do it?

567
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:48,650
Do what?

568
00:39:50,114 --> 00:39:52,321
Lean over the table and kiss me.

569
00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:35,760
Don't mind me, I'm not asleep.

570
00:40:39,491 --> 00:40:42,337
I want to thank you for
helping me out in the restaurant.

571
00:40:51,411 --> 00:40:52,818
Did you tell her?

572
00:40:54,671 --> 00:40:56,326
If you want a family,

573
00:40:57,133 --> 00:40:58,433
if you want kids,

574
00:40:59,661 --> 00:41:01,627
don't put it off.

575
00:41:59,006 --> 00:42:00,306
In my office, please.

576
00:42:07,512 --> 00:42:10,116
Decitabine is not a prohibited drug,
so I don't see why…

577
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,350
Dr. Cornel, I'm here as a liaison.

578
00:42:12,374 --> 00:42:14,378
This request has come
through official channels.

579
00:42:14,402 --> 00:42:16,747
It originates from Washington, DC.

580
00:42:17,064 --> 00:42:18,364
Washington?

581
00:42:20,062 --> 00:42:21,168
English, please.

582
00:42:21,192 --> 00:42:23,606
We have an interest in this person,

583
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:25,244
Abdi Abdikarim.

584
00:42:26,643 --> 00:42:28,923
What kind of a name is that anyway?

585
00:42:28,947 --> 00:42:30,627
He said he was Kenyan.

586
00:42:31,292 --> 00:42:33,186
What's your connection to him?

587
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:35,219
I only met him once at a coffee shop.

588
00:42:35,243 --> 00:42:36,746
The rest was through the mails.

589
00:42:36,798 --> 00:42:38,097
When was that?

590
00:42:38,121 --> 00:42:38,953
Two years ago.

591
00:42:38,977 --> 00:42:41,181
You've been prescribing
a rare, potent drug

592
00:42:41,205 --> 00:42:44,137
to somebody you met once
in a coffee shop two years ago?

593
00:42:44,233 --> 00:42:45,913
He had medical records.

594
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:47,707
He was representing someone else,

595
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,428
but the name had been redacted.

596
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:52,050
You have no knowledge of
who's actually using this drug?

597
00:42:52,074 --> 00:42:54,219
None whatsoever,
but I did nothing wrong.

598
00:42:54,243 --> 00:42:56,243
I did everything by the book.

599
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,852
20,000 euros every two months.

600
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:00,512
Does that sound about right?

601
00:43:14,804 --> 00:43:18,339
And why should that
be a security concern?

602
00:43:19,506 --> 00:43:20,806
Cornish…

603
00:43:21,435 --> 00:43:22,735
Cornish…

604
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:25,939
Cornish…

605
00:43:27,482 --> 00:43:28,782
Cornel.

606
00:43:29,233 --> 00:43:31,393
Dr. Iulian Cornel,

607
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:35,064
let us decide what is
or isn't a security concern.

608
00:43:36,041 --> 00:43:37,341
Arrest him.

609
00:43:39,652 --> 00:43:41,646
Dr. Cornel, could you please stand up.

610
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:42,970
What?

611
00:43:43,032 --> 00:43:44,332
Turn around.

612
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,284
No no no, I can't be arrested.
I cannot be arrested.

613
00:43:47,308 --> 00:43:49,392
You don't understand.
- Tell it to your lawyer.

614
00:43:49,416 --> 00:43:52,991
He came into my home last night.
My wife was terrified.

615
00:43:53,056 --> 00:43:54,989
- Who?
- He didn't give his name.

616
00:43:55,013 --> 00:43:57,851
He said Abdi was dead.
He was an Arab.

617
00:43:58,042 --> 00:43:59,926
He wanted the Decitabine

618
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:01,719
and wanted me to go to the patient.

619
00:44:01,743 --> 00:44:03,124
- Where?
- Didn't say.

620
00:44:03,148 --> 00:44:05,342
- Why are you still here?
- Uh…

621
00:44:05,366 --> 00:44:07,653
You asked for more money, didn't you?

622
00:44:07,772 --> 00:44:09,061
How much?

623
00:44:09,085 --> 00:44:10,385
30,000.

624
00:44:10,554 --> 00:44:12,416
You're a successful doctor.

625
00:44:12,477 --> 00:44:14,475
You're going somewhere you don't know

626
00:44:14,499 --> 00:44:16,332
to treat someone you don't know

627
00:44:16,356 --> 00:44:18,501
for a lousy 30,000 euros.

628
00:44:18,525 --> 00:44:20,325
What am I missing here?

629
00:44:21,769 --> 00:44:23,069
Well…

630
00:44:26,562 --> 00:44:27,862
it's my wife.

631
00:44:29,581 --> 00:44:30,988
She's from Kenya.

632
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:34,923
They said they'll kill
her family if I didn't come.

633
00:44:34,947 --> 00:44:36,939
The Arab man who told you this,

634
00:44:36,963 --> 00:44:39,807
is he planning on traveling with you?

635
00:44:40,891 --> 00:44:42,191
I assume so.

636
00:44:43,641 --> 00:44:46,012
You think Cornel will
contact us when they call him?

637
00:44:46,036 --> 00:44:47,324
Yeah, he'll call.

638
00:44:47,348 --> 00:44:50,031
We've got him scared now.
We're his only chance.

639
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:03,207
30.000.

640
00:45:03,657 --> 00:45:05,588
Who does he think he is, eh?

641
00:45:06,548 --> 00:45:07,848
He…

642
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:10,072
he is a crook.

643
00:45:11,859 --> 00:45:15,379
I wouldn't trust him if he wasn't.

644
00:45:17,846 --> 00:45:19,146
Anyway.

645
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:24,256
He only wants 15,000 now, so…

646
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:27,231
he has to come.

647
00:45:27,594 --> 00:45:29,801
Go. Send it from the internet cafe.

648
00:45:29,825 --> 00:45:32,888
Source will ask for more time,
tell him no, I--

649
00:45:33,255 --> 00:45:34,819
I don't have time.

650
00:45:38,818 --> 00:45:40,118
Evan.

651
00:45:44,605 --> 00:45:45,905
Evan.

652
00:46:43,365 --> 00:46:44,665
38.

653
00:46:47,366 --> 00:46:48,666
31.

654
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,600
24.

655
00:46:56,385 --> 00:46:57,685
31.

656
00:46:59,667 --> 00:47:00,967
45.

657
00:47:03,502 --> 00:47:04,802
24.

658
00:47:08,108 --> 00:47:09,408
17.

659
00:47:12,248 --> 00:47:13,548
10.

660
00:47:15,409 --> 00:47:16,709
Three.

661
00:47:27,276 --> 00:47:28,600
You warm enough?

662
00:47:29,044 --> 00:47:30,700
I needed to get some.

663
00:47:32,337 --> 00:47:33,637
I got anxious.

664
00:47:35,162 --> 00:47:36,280
I cou…

665
00:47:36,304 --> 00:47:37,983
couldn't find any, so…

666
00:47:38,007 --> 00:47:39,307
kept walking.

667
00:47:40,814 --> 00:47:42,469
But the thing was I…

668
00:47:43,713 --> 00:47:47,196
I… I… I couldn't remember
the name of the hotel.

669
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:56,280
You left your wallet.

670
00:48:01,707 --> 00:48:03,986
It's just three blocks over.

671
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,004
It happens towards the end of the day.

672
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:16,884
'Sundowner' it's called.

673
00:48:16,914 --> 00:48:19,059
Nobody knows why.

674
00:48:19,463 --> 00:48:21,797
You get anxious, confused…

675
00:48:22,856 --> 00:48:24,653
I had to get out,

676
00:48:24,677 --> 00:48:26,334
go somewhere.

677
00:48:26,358 --> 00:48:28,216
Do you feel better?

678
00:48:28,508 --> 00:48:30,232
And take your medication.

679
00:48:34,001 --> 00:48:35,637
Yeah, I just slipped.

680
00:48:36,443 --> 00:48:37,931
Lost track.

681
00:48:38,835 --> 00:48:40,135
I'm all right.

682
00:48:42,277 --> 00:48:44,330
Dr. Cornel called.

683
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:46,379
The money will arrive tomorrow.

684
00:48:46,981 --> 00:48:49,473
They said to be ready
to travel in a few days,

685
00:48:49,497 --> 00:48:51,593
had to get him a Kenyan visa.

686
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:54,366
Banir's Arab friend?

687
00:48:55,143 --> 00:48:56,443
Yeah.

688
00:49:02,024 --> 00:49:05,010
Come on, let's go this way.
It's gonna start snowing.

689
00:49:05,034 --> 00:49:09,235
I know where the damned Hotel is.
Stop trying to put a bib on me, okay?

690
00:49:09,694 --> 00:49:10,994
Okay.

691
00:49:27,356 --> 00:49:29,011
It's a quarter past.

692
00:50:21,308 --> 00:50:23,473
The airplane ticket and the money.

693
00:50:23,497 --> 00:50:24,797
Okay.

694
00:50:27,554 --> 00:50:28,854
And the passport.

695
00:50:28,966 --> 00:50:30,104
Just give me a second.

696
00:50:30,128 --> 00:50:33,048
You are out of this.
You dodged a bullet.

697
00:50:33,327 --> 00:50:36,055
Nothing's gonna happen
to you or your people.

698
00:51:29,506 --> 00:51:31,517
Any word from Aasim?

699
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:33,887
The doctor will arrive on Wednesday.

700
00:51:35,052 --> 00:51:37,571
After that… nothing?

701
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:39,062
Not yet.

702
00:51:42,025 --> 00:51:43,325
No, no, no. No, no.

703
00:51:44,798 --> 00:51:46,921
Just a few more moments.

704
00:51:51,572 --> 00:51:53,520
What was his phone number again?

705
00:51:54,697 --> 00:51:59,853
254-41-834-5571.

706
00:52:00,397 --> 00:52:01,697
Where is that?

707
00:52:06,435 --> 00:52:07,735
Mombasa.

708
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:10,926
The asshole of East Africa.

709
00:52:11,138 --> 00:52:14,454
That's exactly where someone
like Banir would end up.

710
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:16,981
That's where Cornel
will meet with Banir.

711
00:52:17,005 --> 00:52:19,167
- When?
- Tuesday.

712
00:52:20,957 --> 00:52:22,918
We gotta make Banir think this…

713
00:52:22,942 --> 00:52:25,048
What was his name?
- Aasim.

714
00:52:25,072 --> 00:52:26,396
…is still alive.

715
00:52:26,717 --> 00:52:28,856
Well, all the messages are texts,

716
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,429
so we can text.

717
00:52:34,796 --> 00:52:36,096
Yeah, Michelle?

718
00:52:37,939 --> 00:52:39,239
Yeah, me too.

719
00:52:39,895 --> 00:52:42,274
Look, Milt needs a Kenyan visa.

720
00:52:43,354 --> 00:52:44,654
As soon as possible.

721
00:52:45,826 --> 00:52:47,126
And there's another thing.

722
00:52:48,546 --> 00:52:51,167
After the base is down, just…

723
00:52:51,353 --> 00:52:54,112
tone it down
a little with a cotton ball.

724
00:52:54,844 --> 00:52:56,589
Are you taking this down?

725
00:52:57,546 --> 00:52:58,846
All right.

726
00:53:05,631 --> 00:53:08,651
Dr. Iulian Cornel.

727
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:11,785
I was able to expedite your Kenyan visa.

728
00:53:12,907 --> 00:53:14,207
Serban.

729
00:53:14,562 --> 00:53:16,286
What exactly did you see?

730
00:53:16,342 --> 00:53:18,361
I didn't see anything.

731
00:53:21,179 --> 00:53:22,479
Thank you.

732
00:53:29,419 --> 00:53:32,279
You might want to keep it
to yourself for a day.

733
00:53:32,941 --> 00:53:34,241
Why?

734
00:53:35,651 --> 00:53:38,595
Give Evan another day to
think about what he's doing.

735
00:53:40,487 --> 00:53:41,787
Evan is…

736
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,540
What?

737
00:53:48,814 --> 00:53:50,221
Evan has retired.

738
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:52,816
You should tell him.

739
00:53:54,094 --> 00:53:55,637
I tried.

740
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,486
Michelle had to run.

741
00:55:17,234 --> 00:55:19,176
She said she'll see you tomorrow.

742
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:21,698
She was able to get
my visa. I have it.

743
00:55:21,722 --> 00:55:26,110
I was watching TV. Something
about a body on University campus.

744
00:55:26,134 --> 00:55:27,434
Let's pack up,

745
00:55:27,737 --> 00:55:30,289
go to a hotel near the airport,

746
00:55:30,956 --> 00:55:34,145
stay in the room
until the flight leaves.

747
00:55:34,316 --> 00:55:38,480
Just before the flight,
text Banir from Aasim's phone,

748
00:55:38,925 --> 00:55:41,752
Aasim says he's been
detained by security.

749
00:55:45,367 --> 00:55:47,022
What about Michelle?

750
00:55:50,262 --> 00:55:51,669
What did she ask?

751
00:55:54,256 --> 00:55:56,325
Did she say anything about me?

752
00:55:58,078 --> 00:55:59,378
No.

753
00:55:59,875 --> 00:56:02,228
Don't tell her how the story ends.

754
00:56:48,511 --> 00:56:50,390
I am Dr. Cornel.

755
00:56:52,366 --> 00:56:53,590
- Dr. Cornel.
- Yes.

756
00:56:53,614 --> 00:56:54,913
- Iulian Cornel?
- Yes.

757
00:56:54,937 --> 00:56:57,213
I am Mbui.
So glad you could come.

758
00:56:57,499 --> 00:56:59,418
I'll take you to Dr. Wangari's office.

759
00:56:59,442 --> 00:57:00,742
Where is Aasim?

760
00:57:02,584 --> 00:57:03,884
He is coming.

761
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,519
When did Mr. Ali Hariri
have his last transfusion?

762
00:57:25,543 --> 00:57:26,842
Three days ago.

763
00:57:26,866 --> 00:57:29,019
When is he scheduled for another?

764
00:57:29,043 --> 00:57:30,343
Three days.

765
00:57:30,946 --> 00:57:32,519
Here at the clinic?

766
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:38,620
Saeed Ali Hariri is being
treated at his own residence.

767
00:57:38,644 --> 00:57:40,216
Here at the clinic?

768
00:57:40,321 --> 00:57:43,312
Dr. Cornel, you were given
letter with all explained.

769
00:57:43,336 --> 00:57:44,408
We wrote this.

770
00:57:44,432 --> 00:57:46,360
I am just double checking.

771
00:57:46,384 --> 00:57:49,297
Al-Hariri is not able
to leave his residence.

772
00:57:49,455 --> 00:57:51,215
Let me go through everything tonight.

773
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:52,676
These are for me, correct?

774
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:56,251
Then tomorrow I will visit
Mr. Ali Hariri at his residence.

775
00:57:56,275 --> 00:57:57,457
Will you be coming, doctor?

776
00:57:57,481 --> 00:57:59,911
Dr. Wangari will not be able to join us.

777
00:58:00,153 --> 00:58:02,912
I'll pick you up at the hotel, 4:00 p.m.

778
00:58:33,261 --> 00:58:37,571
Banir's assitant Mbui is going
to pick me up tomorrow 4:00 p.m.

779
00:58:37,631 --> 00:58:40,385
I went shopping at the market.

780
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:44,704
A Jericho 941 and a Glock.

781
00:58:48,917 --> 00:58:50,217
How much?

782
00:58:53,131 --> 00:58:54,865
Two thousand euros.

783
00:58:55,742 --> 00:58:57,042
You got took.

784
00:58:58,161 --> 00:58:59,461
Well…

785
00:58:59,788 --> 00:59:02,150
we've got euros to spare.

786
00:59:05,256 --> 00:59:06,912
You smell something?

787
00:59:08,012 --> 00:59:09,312
Mombasa?

788
00:59:11,538 --> 00:59:15,047
The other night when we
were in the park in Bucharest,

789
00:59:15,298 --> 00:59:16,990
I touched your jacket.

790
00:59:18,367 --> 00:59:20,047
You were wearing this…

791
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:22,789
blue, like canvas jacket,

792
00:59:22,813 --> 00:59:24,546
but when I touched it,

793
00:59:25,072 --> 00:59:27,454
it… it felt just like dog fur.

794
00:59:28,361 --> 00:59:31,638
Isn't it strange when you
can't even trust your own fingers?

795
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:33,760
And don't ask me how I feel.

796
00:59:33,784 --> 00:59:35,418
I wouldn't think of it.

797
00:59:39,167 --> 00:59:40,467
Evan.

798
00:59:41,855 --> 00:59:43,155
Crock.

799
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:46,200
Crock is… gun.

800
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:49,467
No way I'll be able to bring
a gun with me tomorrow.

801
00:59:49,905 --> 00:59:52,845
Mbui frisked me today.
He'll frisk me again tomorrow.

802
00:59:53,708 --> 00:59:55,499
Well, how do you plan to do it?

803
00:59:55,523 --> 00:59:58,518
It's been so long,
thought about it so long,

804
00:59:59,371 --> 01:00:00,671
I'm not sure.

805
01:00:01,089 --> 01:00:03,478
Maybe I'll just let
the moment guide me.

806
01:00:03,864 --> 01:00:06,209
I've got a syringe and medication.

807
01:00:06,464 --> 01:00:07,763
One's quick and painless,

808
01:00:07,787 --> 01:00:09,584
the other's a
strychnine derivative…

809
01:00:09,608 --> 01:00:12,649
excruciating, takes over an hour.

810
01:00:13,177 --> 01:00:15,185
Or maybe I'll just get up close to him,

811
01:00:15,209 --> 01:00:18,449
slice him and let his blood
wash all over me.

812
01:00:19,858 --> 01:00:23,057
I don't feel comfortable
letting you go in there alone.

813
01:00:23,081 --> 01:00:24,571
I'll be all right.

814
01:00:25,923 --> 01:00:27,379
I brought a belt blade.

815
01:00:27,403 --> 01:00:30,445
I'll be able to get that through,
but that's about it.

816
01:00:33,325 --> 01:00:35,325
- So that's that then?
- Yeah.

817
01:00:36,376 --> 01:00:37,676
Milt…

818
01:00:38,411 --> 01:00:40,246
thanks for coming along.

819
01:00:40,876 --> 01:00:42,867
No problem, old sport.

820
01:01:13,921 --> 01:01:15,713
If I'm not out in an hour,

821
01:01:15,737 --> 01:01:17,603
do whatever you want.

822
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,740
Please.

823
01:01:43,854 --> 01:01:45,426
Did you sleep well?

824
01:01:46,263 --> 01:01:48,470
Sometimes the heat is a problem.

825
01:02:20,425 --> 01:02:22,617
Open the briefcase.

826
01:04:02,229 --> 01:04:03,529
Dr. Cornel.

827
01:04:04,478 --> 01:04:05,667
Salaam alaikum.

828
01:04:05,691 --> 01:04:08,483
Salaam alaikum, Saeed Ali Hariri.

829
01:04:08,507 --> 01:04:11,629
Dr. Cornel, thank you.

830
01:04:12,024 --> 01:04:13,703
Thank you for coming.

831
01:04:13,727 --> 01:04:15,300
Forgive me for not…

832
01:04:16,174 --> 01:04:17,474
standing.

833
01:04:19,282 --> 01:04:21,285
Mbui, some tea.

834
01:04:23,558 --> 01:04:25,773
And those… those dates.

835
01:04:25,797 --> 01:04:27,097
Mind if I sit?

836
01:04:27,542 --> 01:04:28,842
Oh, please.

837
01:04:32,943 --> 01:04:36,429
Dr. Wangari has
provided me your records,

838
01:04:36,453 --> 01:04:38,132
your treatment history.

839
01:04:38,156 --> 01:04:41,930
Last night I was in contact
with several of my colleagues.

840
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:43,386
Thank you.

841
01:04:45,854 --> 01:04:48,301
I noticed you were scheduled
three months ago

842
01:04:48,325 --> 01:04:49,991
for a bone marrow transplant,

843
01:04:50,015 --> 01:04:52,104
but I found no record of the procedure.

844
01:04:52,128 --> 01:04:54,193
Was there a problem with the donor?

845
01:04:54,217 --> 01:04:55,896
It was too dangerous.

846
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,670
Uh, no sibling donor was possible,

847
01:04:58,694 --> 01:05:01,276
no compatible cousins.

848
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:05,155
It is risky, but an unrelated donor

849
01:05:05,179 --> 01:05:10,192
can be found based on HLB
and DR histocompatibility.

850
01:05:13,796 --> 01:05:17,229
The university hospital
can assist in finding such a donor.

851
01:05:17,253 --> 01:05:18,977
We have a large database.

852
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:22,280
Should have been done before.

853
01:05:22,304 --> 01:05:27,544
It is more dangerous now,
but we have no choice.

854
01:05:27,697 --> 01:05:32,877
At present, transplantation is
the only possible curative therapy.

855
01:05:33,477 --> 01:05:37,918
And… it can be done here?

856
01:05:37,942 --> 01:05:39,242
Yes.

857
01:05:43,778 --> 01:05:46,261
Excuse me,
I am not such a young man.

858
01:05:46,635 --> 01:05:48,290
Where is the toilet?

859
01:05:48,675 --> 01:05:50,522
Back and to the left.

860
01:05:51,516 --> 01:05:54,040
- So sorry.
- Oh, please. Please.

861
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:24,515
There is a problem with the toilet.

862
01:06:24,733 --> 01:06:26,998
Mmm. Mbui.

863
01:06:33,107 --> 01:06:34,635
It won't flush.

864
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:37,732
- You pulled the chain?
- I pulled the chain.

865
01:06:38,899 --> 01:06:42,532
There is something stuck… in there.

866
01:07:08,241 --> 01:07:09,896
I have to be honest.

867
01:07:11,036 --> 01:07:14,256
Your condition is
far worse than I imagined.

868
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:18,280
Your long-term chances
for survival are not good.

869
01:07:21,419 --> 01:07:24,169
Neither are your short-term chances.

870
01:07:29,052 --> 01:07:31,609
In fact, they are quite hopeless.

871
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:37,004
It's because I'm not a doctor.

872
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:45,726
My name isn't Iulian Cornel…

873
01:07:46,581 --> 01:07:49,192
and your name isn't Ali Hariri.

874
01:07:50,265 --> 01:07:51,565
Your name…

875
01:07:51,943 --> 01:07:53,750
is Muhammad Banir.

876
01:08:07,331 --> 01:08:08,784
Mr. Ruchowski.

877
01:08:11,042 --> 01:08:12,342
Evan Lake.

878
01:08:15,409 --> 01:08:17,539
- Where is your backup?
- Hmm?

879
01:08:18,044 --> 01:08:19,724
Your elite commandos.

880
01:08:20,528 --> 01:08:21,828
Oh.

881
01:08:22,206 --> 01:08:23,506
You came alone.

882
01:08:29,826 --> 01:08:31,672
How did you find me?

883
01:08:32,083 --> 01:08:36,956
Through the request for experimental
thalassemia medication, Decitabine.

884
01:08:37,927 --> 01:08:39,805
Family medical history.

885
01:08:42,275 --> 01:08:43,575
Yeah.

886
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:47,672
So…

887
01:08:51,274 --> 01:08:52,574
how are you…

888
01:08:53,793 --> 01:08:55,653
How are you going to kill me?

889
01:08:57,528 --> 01:08:59,428
I- I-I don't know.

890
01:09:00,941 --> 01:09:02,941
How are you going to kill me?

891
01:09:03,312 --> 01:09:04,612
I don't know.

892
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:09,191
What the hell are you doing?

893
01:09:10,848 --> 01:09:13,099
We have some time.

894
01:09:14,231 --> 01:09:15,813
Perhaps we can have that…

895
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:21,481
conversation that I wanted to have
that time years ago.

896
01:09:21,717 --> 01:09:23,017
Huh?

897
01:09:24,203 --> 01:09:26,920
Perhaps you've read some of my writings?

898
01:09:27,895 --> 01:09:31,938
Mr. Lake, we strongly recommend you put
the matter of Muhammad Banir behind you.

899
01:09:31,962 --> 01:09:33,740
I didn't know you were still active.

900
01:09:35,967 --> 01:09:37,148
I contribute…

901
01:09:37,172 --> 01:09:40,280
a number of web sites
not under my name.

902
01:09:40,462 --> 01:09:44,004
Of course,
you are religious man, Mr. Lake?

903
01:09:44,036 --> 01:09:46,011
No, I'm not religious.

904
01:09:46,035 --> 01:09:47,796
I think you are.

905
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:49,961
America, yeah?

906
01:09:49,985 --> 01:09:52,336
You see yourself as a religion…
America.

907
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:55,305
I've written about this,
the American way of life.

908
01:09:55,979 --> 01:09:58,323
Have you been
to Greeley, Colorado?

909
01:09:58,839 --> 01:10:01,164
Sayyid Qutb…

910
01:10:01,188 --> 01:10:04,961
who went from Cairo
to Colorado State College in 1948.

911
01:10:04,985 --> 01:10:07,882
He said Greeley was
like paradise on earth.

912
01:10:09,365 --> 01:10:12,246
What Qutb saw was jahiliyyah, huh?

913
01:10:13,302 --> 01:10:16,182
Decadence,
promiscuity, pop music.

914
01:10:16,206 --> 01:10:17,974
"Baby, It's Cold Outside."

915
01:10:29,393 --> 01:10:33,175
The- the- the flirting
and the mixing of men and women,

916
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:35,873
the disrespect… so no, he left.

917
01:10:35,946 --> 01:10:39,585
Went back to Egypt
and the movement was born.

918
01:10:39,609 --> 01:10:41,289
The Muslim Brotherhood.

919
01:10:41,379 --> 01:10:43,130
My father knew him.

920
01:10:43,324 --> 01:10:45,174
No, Nasser…

921
01:10:45,314 --> 01:10:47,349
Nasser executed him.

922
01:10:50,069 --> 01:10:51,796
It was too late.

923
01:10:52,649 --> 01:10:54,520
Fundamentalism,

924
01:10:55,062 --> 01:10:56,361
the message…

925
01:10:56,385 --> 01:10:58,017
from the prophet…

926
01:10:58,044 --> 01:11:00,118
was social justice!

927
01:11:00,142 --> 01:11:03,061
Better schools, better jobs.

928
01:11:03,085 --> 01:11:04,385
Mr. Lake.

929
01:11:05,391 --> 01:11:08,583
This doesn't just… just end.

930
01:11:09,104 --> 01:11:11,760
Are you still a believer?

931
01:11:12,386 --> 01:11:14,837
Hmm?
Do you still believe?

932
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:16,922
I don't. I don't.

933
01:11:17,491 --> 01:11:21,446
My faith, it was…
it was taken from me.

934
01:11:22,012 --> 01:11:25,057
You think I'm playing games
with you, Mr. Lake?

935
01:11:25,081 --> 01:11:26,381
Huh?

936
01:11:27,298 --> 01:11:29,688
You think we are playing games?

937
01:11:29,712 --> 01:11:31,115
No, my name is Charles Ruchowski.

938
01:11:31,139 --> 01:11:32,759
While mullahs,
ayatollahs, they get rich.

939
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:36,681
They have their orgies,
imprison their opponents.

940
01:11:36,705 --> 01:11:38,385
Why? Hmm? Why?

941
01:11:38,472 --> 01:11:41,024
I'm Charles Ruchowski.

942
01:11:41,048 --> 01:11:45,066
I'm a representative for Spirit Systems.

943
01:11:46,848 --> 01:11:50,811
The only hope
for Islam now is…

944
01:11:51,058 --> 01:11:52,873
Marx, hmm?

945
01:11:54,191 --> 01:11:55,865
Social justice.

946
01:11:56,589 --> 01:11:58,857
We like the fear.
<i>I</i> like the fear.

947
01:11:58,881 --> 01:12:00,288
I like the fear.

948
01:12:00,863 --> 01:12:03,294
Our believers, not so many.

949
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:07,365
No, the truly dangerous people…

950
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,394
are the ones who follow orders.

951
01:12:09,431 --> 01:12:11,243
Do you think it made any difference?

952
01:12:11,267 --> 01:12:12,757
What you did!

953
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:16,429
You! You! You!

954
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:19,884
Do you?

955
01:12:24,516 --> 01:12:31,603
Now, what is the name
of the source, Mr. Lake?

956
01:12:34,548 --> 01:12:36,856
You are sick too. Hmm?

957
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,955
I see it, your face.

958
01:12:39,901 --> 01:12:42,698
You have a disease of the blood.

959
01:12:43,107 --> 01:12:45,419
My disease is in the brain.

960
01:12:45,576 --> 01:12:47,530
What sort of disease?

961
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:51,279
I'm forgetting things.

962
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:53,676
Ohh.

963
01:12:54,831 --> 01:12:56,555
There is a lot to forget.

964
01:14:45,437 --> 01:14:46,737
Evan.

965
01:14:46,858 --> 01:14:48,549
Come upstairs.
