1
00:02:14,078 --> 00:02:16,706
- What is the planet called?
- Earth.

2
00:02:16,781 --> 00:02:20,273
Two billion inhabitants,
primitive nation-states...

3
00:02:20,652 --> 00:02:24,247
crude beginnings in science.
They call themselves humans.

4
00:02:24,722 --> 00:02:27,486
They always call themselves human.
But they're not.

5
00:02:27,592 --> 00:02:30,060
They're savages. And they're dangerous.

6
00:02:30,128 --> 00:02:32,653
- Not yet.
- Do they have atomic power?

7
00:02:33,264 --> 00:02:35,391
They're just beginning to develop it.

8
00:02:35,466 --> 00:02:37,366
But they do have wars?

9
00:02:38,536 --> 00:02:39,525
Yes.

10
00:02:40,004 --> 00:02:44,771
Warlike savages with atomic power.
Next: Space flight.

11
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:48,476
Then they become a threat
to every civilized planet.

12
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,014
I vote we sterilize this Earth. Now.

13
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:56,985
- You don't speak for the Council, Sakri.
- Nor do you, Andros.

14
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,653
How long have you been an observer
on this Earth?

15
00:03:03,728 --> 00:03:06,424
A little more than 3,000 of their years.

16
00:03:06,931 --> 00:03:09,491
And you identify with them.

17
00:03:11,035 --> 00:03:13,026
Yes, I like them.

18
00:03:13,338 --> 00:03:15,101
You're an observer, Andros.

19
00:03:15,173 --> 00:03:18,768
Civilized, empathetic, but prejudiced.

20
00:03:18,843 --> 00:03:21,243
I'm inclined to agree with Sakri.

21
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,813
- I think this Earth should be sterilized.
- No.

22
00:03:24,883 --> 00:03:26,714
The Compact Laws are specific:

23
00:03:26,784 --> 00:03:30,948
Before any action on a primitive planet
there must be a judgment.

24
00:03:41,499 --> 00:03:45,230
Very well. You will return to Earth.

25
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,830
We will remain in sensory contact
with you.

26
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:51,106
Show us these humans...

27
00:03:51,175 --> 00:03:55,771
convince the Council that they deserve
a chance to survive, to grow.

28
00:03:57,115 --> 00:03:59,549
But it will be up to you to pass judgment.

29
00:03:59,984 --> 00:04:03,647
If you can't convince us, Andros,
don't resist us.

30
00:04:05,523 --> 00:04:09,084
Then we would have to destroy you
along with the planet.

31
00:04:50,335 --> 00:04:54,362
Yes, sir, certainly. We will notify C.I.C.
On a continuing basis.

32
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,905
We've alerted observatories to report
any more unidentified objects.

33
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,703
Yes, sir. Thank you.

34
00:05:03,481 --> 00:05:06,507
Steve, this phone has been ringing
off its hook all morning.

35
00:05:06,584 --> 00:05:09,519
Everyone thinks that
that unidentified object last night...

36
00:05:09,587 --> 00:05:11,748
was some sort of secret weapon.

37
00:05:11,823 --> 00:05:14,815
- Any more sightings reported?
- No, just the one.

38
00:05:14,892 --> 00:05:18,089
The only other unusual report
was on the weather.

39
00:05:18,296 --> 00:05:21,094
Thunder, lightning,
and an incredible amount of rain...

40
00:05:21,165 --> 00:05:23,690
at exactly the same time that meteor hit.

41
00:05:23,768 --> 00:05:24,757
Meteor?

42
00:05:24,869 --> 00:05:27,861
That's what the Dominion Observatory
thinks it was.

43
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:29,338
Maybe.

44
00:05:29,574 --> 00:05:32,566
But the Nazis have been perfecting
a kind of flying missile...

45
00:05:32,643 --> 00:05:34,406
sort of an airborne torpedo.

46
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,039
In any case,
we do have a possible location...

47
00:05:37,115 --> 00:05:40,175
and the search squads
have already been out for several hours.

48
00:06:23,528 --> 00:06:26,497
- I've landed.
- We are monitoring, Andros.

49
00:06:27,131 --> 00:06:29,292
Commencing judgment survey.

50
00:07:19,884 --> 00:07:22,717
I don't care what kind of terrain you're on.

51
00:07:22,787 --> 00:07:25,517
I want that flying whatever-it-was found.

52
00:07:37,368 --> 00:07:38,767
Who are you?

53
00:07:40,972 --> 00:07:42,803
Identify yourself.

54
00:07:44,242 --> 00:07:46,369
What are you doing talking German?

55
00:07:51,682 --> 00:07:52,979
I'm sorry.

56
00:07:54,752 --> 00:07:57,915
Call me Andros, please. I am a visitor.

57
00:07:58,222 --> 00:08:01,817
A very peaceful visitor, come to speak
to the leaders of your government...

58
00:08:01,893 --> 00:08:06,193
- on a matter of considerable importance.
- It's a restricted area, mister.

59
00:08:06,264 --> 00:08:10,064
- I need some kind of identification.
- I've already told you, my name is Andros.

60
00:08:10,134 --> 00:08:12,728
That doesn't mean anything to me.
Who are you?

61
00:08:12,803 --> 00:08:15,533
How did you waltz
through a squad of my men?

62
00:08:15,773 --> 00:08:17,764
I'm a visitor.

63
00:08:18,676 --> 00:08:19,665
An alien.

64
00:08:19,744 --> 00:08:23,737
- You were speaking German.
- I do not come from Germany, General.

65
00:08:24,348 --> 00:08:27,283
But from what you might call outer space.

66
00:08:30,054 --> 00:08:33,888
And I must apologize
for causing this disturbance.

67
00:08:35,426 --> 00:08:39,021
You must understand.
It is sometimes difficult...

68
00:08:39,664 --> 00:08:41,495
to come into another culture.

69
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:44,458
- What are you talking about?
- Tightrope walking, Major.

70
00:08:44,535 --> 00:08:48,403
I want to speak to President Roosevelt
and some of the leaders of Congress first.

71
00:08:48,472 --> 00:08:51,270
- What?
- Then Stalin, Churchill, de Gaulle...

72
00:08:51,442 --> 00:08:52,739
and Chiang Kai-Shek.

73
00:08:53,377 --> 00:08:58,246
Later, of course, Mussolini,
Emperor Hirohito, and Adolf Hitler.

74
00:09:01,385 --> 00:09:04,252
It's a bad time for jokes, mister.
There's a war on!

75
00:09:04,322 --> 00:09:06,586
Of course. That's why I'm here.

76
00:09:06,891 --> 00:09:09,052
As the representative of...

77
00:09:09,627 --> 00:09:13,028
Call it a Council of Planets.
The representatives of the Council...

78
00:09:13,097 --> 00:09:17,500
have been observing Earth and humanity
for quite some time now.

79
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:19,459
Since the Neolithic.

80
00:09:31,115 --> 00:09:33,413
At this moment,
there's a great deal of worry...

81
00:09:33,484 --> 00:09:36,976
about the combination
of your planet's growing technology...

82
00:09:37,054 --> 00:09:38,954
and continued savagery.

83
00:09:39,857 --> 00:09:42,985
Many of us had hoped
that you might be more civilized by now.

84
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,652
Are you here to pass judgment?

85
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:47,630
No. I'm here to observe, first.

86
00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:50,394
To find the potential
for peaceful development...

87
00:09:50,468 --> 00:09:52,095
before it's too late.

88
00:09:53,104 --> 00:09:55,937
- I hope I'm making myself clear.
- As mud.

89
00:09:56,007 --> 00:09:57,770
You're either a spy or a mental case.

90
00:09:57,842 --> 00:10:00,242
Either way you're under arrest. Sergeant!

91
00:10:13,124 --> 00:10:14,614
Thank you, Major.

92
00:10:16,794 --> 00:10:18,421
Please do not attack me.

93
00:10:18,496 --> 00:10:21,761
I'm linked to my spacecraft's
special support system...

94
00:10:21,832 --> 00:10:25,097
and in guarding me,
it might hurt one of you.

95
00:10:27,071 --> 00:10:29,596
- General, as long as Mr...
- Andros.

96
00:10:30,074 --> 00:10:33,874
...Andros is willing to come with us
peacefully, why not have the meeting?

97
00:10:34,045 --> 00:10:35,672
The President could be informed.

98
00:10:35,746 --> 00:10:37,839
And speaking for intelligence...

99
00:10:37,915 --> 00:10:41,646
I'd like to find out just how
he managed to stun those soldiers.

100
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:43,878
Something to that, Major.

101
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,254
Get clear! Grenade!

102
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:19,020
Sergeant, report to me at 1800 hours.

103
00:11:19,623 --> 00:11:21,318
And you, Andros...

104
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,827
I'll arrange for you
to be conducted to Washington...

105
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:29,488
to the War Department, pronto.
In absolute secrecy.

106
00:11:42,413 --> 00:11:45,075
Come on, Bjornsen,
you're a newspaperman...

107
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:47,140
it's gotta be worth money to you.

108
00:11:47,218 --> 00:11:50,984
A story about a man who catches
grenades with his bare hands...

109
00:11:51,088 --> 00:11:53,556
- and holds them while they explode?
- I saw him.

110
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,953
I think he's some kind of scientist
or something.

111
00:11:57,027 --> 00:11:59,427
And, listen, General Kane himself...

112
00:11:59,497 --> 00:12:01,897
is taking this guy right to the top.

113
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:07,429
Maybe it would be a human-interest story.

114
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:09,698
Worth $5.

115
00:12:09,874 --> 00:12:12,342
I ain't fussy. Not on $21 a month.

116
00:12:39,403 --> 00:12:40,427
Von Dreiberg.

117
00:12:40,504 --> 00:12:42,233
Reporting, Herr General.

118
00:12:42,573 --> 00:12:45,940
I have learned the Americans
are holding top-level meetings...

119
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,602
with an alien scientist.

120
00:12:47,878 --> 00:12:49,209
Alien? From where?

121
00:12:49,647 --> 00:12:52,207
Nationality unknown, sir.

122
00:12:52,283 --> 00:12:55,684
But it appears he is central to
the development of major new weapons.

123
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,383
New weapons? There have been rumors.

124
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,825
Secure all facts on this alien scientist.
Then seize him.

125
00:13:04,061 --> 00:13:06,029
But, sir, he will be very closely guarded.

126
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,194
I'm not concerned with that,
you will seize him.

127
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:13,030
Out troops are smashing through Africa,
we will soon take Paris.

128
00:13:13,471 --> 00:13:16,269
With this alien scientist's secrets
at our command...

129
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,308
we will conquer the world
that much sooner.

130
00:13:19,343 --> 00:13:20,537
Yes, sir.

131
00:13:32,256 --> 00:13:36,249
All right, sir, we'll set up
a preliminary session for tomorrow.

132
00:13:36,527 --> 00:13:38,518
Thank you, Mr. Secretary.

133
00:13:42,032 --> 00:13:44,592
Mr. Andros, the White House is interested.

134
00:13:44,668 --> 00:13:46,431
Just Andros, please.

135
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:47,862
All right.

136
00:13:48,072 --> 00:13:51,439
In any case, we will arrange
a preliminary meeting...

137
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:56,578
and demonstration
of your techniques for tomorrow.

138
00:13:57,815 --> 00:14:01,080
And that's necessary, before meeting
with the President and Congress?

139
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:03,517
I'm afraid so, Mr...

140
00:14:04,054 --> 00:14:05,043
Andros.

141
00:14:09,126 --> 00:14:10,354
Pardon?

142
00:14:10,561 --> 00:14:12,461
That's classic Greek, sir.

143
00:14:14,598 --> 00:14:18,830
"A messenger to barbarians
is a beast of burden," sir.

144
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,767
No offense meant, gentlemen.

145
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,034
Something an old friend of mine
once said at a party.

146
00:14:24,108 --> 00:14:25,803
Socrates said that.

147
00:14:26,443 --> 00:14:28,206
Yes, that's correct.

148
00:14:29,847 --> 00:14:32,839
I see I am not alone
in having met that great man.

149
00:14:37,888 --> 00:14:41,380
Well, in any case,
Major Trevor and Yeoman Prince...

150
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,756
will arrange for your quarters.

151
00:14:43,827 --> 00:14:46,660
They're expecting you
at Harrison Academy.

152
00:14:47,164 --> 00:14:51,157
That's an official guesthouse we use.
You will be, of course...

153
00:14:51,235 --> 00:14:53,829
a guest of the United States government.

154
00:15:17,628 --> 00:15:20,324
This will be your quarters, Andros.
If you will follow me.

155
00:16:01,939 --> 00:16:04,601
- Thanks.
- You're welcome, Major.

156
00:16:04,742 --> 00:16:07,370
Though I have the feeling
you didn't need much help.

157
00:16:07,478 --> 00:16:10,538
- And thank you, Wonder Woman.
- Luckily, I heard the sounds.

158
00:16:10,748 --> 00:16:13,239
- Where's Diana?
- She's probably getting help.

159
00:16:13,317 --> 00:16:16,775
I am delighted to finally meet
the fabled Wonder Woman.

160
00:16:16,987 --> 00:16:20,582
But not to see you earthlings give in
to your weakness for violence.

161
00:16:22,126 --> 00:16:24,117
We better all get inside.

162
00:16:25,696 --> 00:16:28,995
- Paul Bjornsen, Swedish news service.
- Thanks again.

163
00:16:30,768 --> 00:16:32,793
- Will I see you again?
- Perhaps.

164
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,161
I'll look forward to it.

165
00:16:45,315 --> 00:16:46,304
Here you are, Andros.

166
00:16:48,986 --> 00:16:52,046
Are you all right? I notified the police.

167
00:16:52,156 --> 00:16:56,525
It's okay, Diana. It's all over.
Got a little help from Wonder Woman.

168
00:16:56,627 --> 00:16:59,858
Yes, it's fortunate Wonder Woman
was so close at hand...

169
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,898
isn't it, Yeoman Prince?

170
00:17:02,032 --> 00:17:04,193
Yes, it was very fortunate.

171
00:17:05,469 --> 00:17:07,994
And we had some help
from this Good Samaritan.

172
00:17:08,072 --> 00:17:11,337
- Paul Bjornsen.
- Yeoman Diana Prince.

173
00:17:11,408 --> 00:17:12,966
Is this violence customary?

174
00:17:13,911 --> 00:17:16,641
Unfortunately, every big city
has some crime.

175
00:17:16,714 --> 00:17:18,614
Yes, of course.

176
00:17:18,982 --> 00:17:22,713
Babylon, Sodom and Gomorrah,
and your Barbary Coast.

177
00:17:22,886 --> 00:17:27,789
The names of the cities change,
but the squalor and crime do not.

178
00:17:31,261 --> 00:17:33,388
Well, we can talk about it later.

179
00:17:33,464 --> 00:17:35,489
I'd like some details, for my news service.

180
00:17:35,566 --> 00:17:36,760
I'm sorry.

181
00:17:36,834 --> 00:17:39,667
I think we will postpone any meetings,
Major Trevor...

182
00:17:39,803 --> 00:17:42,795
- until I gather more data.
- Look, they were just petty crooks.

183
00:17:42,873 --> 00:17:45,501
Yes, but why are there
always so many of them...

184
00:17:45,576 --> 00:17:47,510
and so few of the others?

185
00:17:49,146 --> 00:17:52,377
He once accused me
of being impatient with humanity.

186
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,039
Lincoln?

187
00:17:56,887 --> 00:17:57,945
Yes.

188
00:17:58,956 --> 00:18:00,890
Perhaps I am impatient.

189
00:18:02,025 --> 00:18:04,721
But one week later he was assassinated.

190
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,324
I'll contact you, Major.

191
00:18:07,397 --> 00:18:10,298
I'm sorry, but for your own protection
it's best...

192
00:18:37,795 --> 00:18:39,558
I accept full responsibility, sir.

193
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,895
Nonsense, Steve.
You can't be blamed because this...

194
00:18:42,966 --> 00:18:46,663
alien uses some kind
of a super-science gadget on you.

195
00:18:46,837 --> 00:18:49,704
I certainly hope the General
isn't too hard on Major Trevor.

196
00:18:49,773 --> 00:18:53,641
Perhaps if he is,
a plea from a lovely girl might help.

197
00:18:53,877 --> 00:18:56,846
Our statements may also be helpful.

198
00:18:57,948 --> 00:19:00,974
I'll want regular reports
on your investigation, Steve.

199
00:19:01,051 --> 00:19:02,848
- And results.
- Yes, sir.

200
00:19:04,021 --> 00:19:06,785
Come on, Diana. We've got work to do.

201
00:19:09,793 --> 00:19:13,285
I'm sorry, Mr. Bjornsen, from here on out,
this matter is top-secret.

202
00:19:13,397 --> 00:19:15,763
Even to a friendly,
neutral Swedish newspaperman?

203
00:19:15,866 --> 00:19:19,461
I know you're a neutral and have press
clearance, but it's still top-secret.

204
00:19:19,536 --> 00:19:21,436
Of course, I understand.

205
00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:26,641
General Blankenship,
have you met Mr. Bjornsen?

206
00:19:26,777 --> 00:19:28,404
He's a very well-known correspondent.

207
00:19:28,478 --> 00:19:29,911
And an admirer of yours, sir...

208
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,472
especially your theories
on airborne invasion technique.

209
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:36,280
Well, that's most unusual, Mr. Bjornsen.

210
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,150
A civilian who understands
technical military tactics.

211
00:19:39,223 --> 00:19:41,851
Actually, sir, I could use
your help and advice...

212
00:19:41,925 --> 00:19:46,487
for a series of articles I'm doing
on outstanding military theoreticians.

213
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:52,629
I guess I have a few minutes. Come in.

214
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,014
And we'll want to get a description
of Andros...

215
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:09,484
out to every police station
and sheriff's office, as well.

216
00:20:09,653 --> 00:20:11,211
This is a full-scale search...

217
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:13,882
and I've got the final responsibility
for finding him.

218
00:20:13,991 --> 00:20:17,085
Is there any word on the location
of the spacecraft, sir?

219
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,252
No, not yet.

220
00:20:18,328 --> 00:20:19,920
I've got search teams crisscrossing...

221
00:20:19,997 --> 00:20:22,625
every possible landing site
in Virginia and Maryland...

222
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:24,326
and still nothing.

223
00:20:24,401 --> 00:20:27,302
Sir, may I suggest alerting
the civil-defense workers, too?

224
00:20:27,371 --> 00:20:30,966
They may help supplement the search
for both Andros and spacecraft.

225
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,976
- Good idea, why don't you take care of it?
- Yes, sir. Right away.

226
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:39,781
If you get any other notions,
go ahead with them.

227
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,374
Thank you, sir.

228
00:20:47,157 --> 00:20:49,022
As a matter of fact...

229
00:20:50,761 --> 00:20:52,558
I do have an idea.

230
00:21:08,178 --> 00:21:10,112
A local god-figure?

231
00:21:10,447 --> 00:21:12,312
A great human hero...

232
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:17,581
great because he made peace
as well as war.

233
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:22,087
- Where is he now, Andros?
- He's dead.

234
00:21:22,726 --> 00:21:24,626
Humans are short-lived.

235
00:21:25,595 --> 00:21:26,926
How did he die?

236
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:31,796
He was assassinated.

237
00:21:32,636 --> 00:21:33,728
Of course.

238
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,871
I thought I might find you here.

239
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:49,410
How did you know me
when I was Diana Prince?

240
00:21:50,454 --> 00:21:52,888
I felt the difference between us.

241
00:21:53,824 --> 00:21:55,519
And the sameness.

242
00:21:57,394 --> 00:21:59,021
We're both exiles.

243
00:21:59,463 --> 00:22:02,261
No. I'm a volunteer.

244
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,625
- A volunteer to help mankind?
- Yes.

245
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:10,967
To work and fight
for justice and democracy.

246
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:15,674
I think that's important and necessary,
don't you?

247
00:22:16,313 --> 00:22:17,302
Perhaps.

248
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:22,348
He's an example
of what humans can achieve...

249
00:22:22,953 --> 00:22:25,888
can be and should be.

250
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,353
You can help us...

251
00:22:29,026 --> 00:22:32,257
- help the Allies against the Nazis.
- No.

252
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:37,066
I am sworn to certain regulations.
I must remain neutral.

253
00:22:37,134 --> 00:22:41,366
Even though General Blankenship hopes
I'll give him an arsenal of new weapons.

254
00:22:41,471 --> 00:22:44,963
Mankind is destructive enough.

255
00:22:45,976 --> 00:22:47,443
I understand.

256
00:22:56,186 --> 00:22:58,916
When you arrived, the storms...

257
00:22:59,756 --> 00:23:01,849
You can control the weather, can't you?

258
00:23:04,327 --> 00:23:07,592
I thought you would understand.
Yes, I use natural forces...

259
00:23:08,198 --> 00:23:10,325
from tipping the mind to sleep...

260
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,700
- to changing the balance of atmosphere.
- I don't understand.

261
00:24:09,226 --> 00:24:12,320
The power you have, it's awesome.

262
00:24:12,562 --> 00:24:13,893
I don't use it lightly.

263
00:24:13,964 --> 00:24:17,092
As I said, I am not here to arm mankind,
but to study it.

264
00:24:18,068 --> 00:24:21,333
- Can I help?
- I'd like that very much.

265
00:24:21,938 --> 00:24:23,496
I need a guide.

266
00:24:26,443 --> 00:24:28,172
And I need a friend.

267
00:24:30,881 --> 00:24:32,314
$20.

268
00:24:32,849 --> 00:24:36,615
That's a lot of money for a plain,
hard-working Swedish newspaper man...

269
00:24:36,686 --> 00:24:40,178
but, here, $20. I bet you...

270
00:24:40,323 --> 00:24:43,087
that Andros demonstration will be at...

271
00:24:44,127 --> 00:24:45,754
- Fort Meade.
- No.

272
00:24:47,497 --> 00:24:49,761
Aberdeen Proving Grounds.

273
00:24:50,133 --> 00:24:51,896
I don't think I like this game anymore.

274
00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:54,064
You're right, Etta, and I am sorry.

275
00:24:54,137 --> 00:24:57,470
I know you can't talk
about top-secret information.

276
00:24:57,541 --> 00:25:00,635
You're right,
everything is always so hush-hush.

277
00:25:02,412 --> 00:25:05,074
But I do know one thing I can tell you.

278
00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:07,582
What's that?

279
00:25:08,018 --> 00:25:09,610
My phone number.

280
00:25:09,886 --> 00:25:12,787
And this $20 would buy a terrific night out.

281
00:25:13,323 --> 00:25:14,585
For two.

282
00:25:14,724 --> 00:25:18,922
Now that's a remarkable idea.

283
00:25:25,835 --> 00:25:30,363
I have agreed to this demonstration
to make clear that I am very serious...

284
00:25:30,507 --> 00:25:32,998
and that I must speak to the heads
of your government.

285
00:25:33,109 --> 00:25:36,943
I hope what I do here will make you accept
that I am not from Earth...

286
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:40,907
and that I'm here
on a most important mission.

287
00:26:25,629 --> 00:26:27,961
I think you've made your point.

288
00:26:28,898 --> 00:26:30,229
I agree, sir.

289
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,464
Then you do accept that Andros
is from beyond this planet, gentlemen?

290
00:26:34,838 --> 00:26:36,897
Yes, you've convinced me.

291
00:26:38,942 --> 00:26:41,809
What exactly did you want
to discuss with the President?

292
00:26:42,012 --> 00:26:45,914
The Council of Planets
is concerned about this war...

293
00:26:46,283 --> 00:26:48,979
and about your atomic research
at Oak Ridge.

294
00:26:49,152 --> 00:26:50,779
I'm afraid that's top-secret.

295
00:26:50,854 --> 00:26:55,348
Atomic power is the first step.
And the next one is space travel.

296
00:26:56,259 --> 00:26:58,727
Humans will swarm into the galaxy.

297
00:26:59,362 --> 00:27:00,852
Space is vast.

298
00:27:01,598 --> 00:27:05,466
And life is precious and rare.

299
00:27:05,802 --> 00:27:08,828
We cherish it. We do not have wars.

300
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:12,140
- We didn't want this one, sir.
- Who is "we"?

301
00:27:12,942 --> 00:27:16,605
I come to visit not your country, General,
but your planet.

302
00:27:17,047 --> 00:27:18,708
And to make a determination.

303
00:27:18,782 --> 00:27:22,445
If this brutal warfare is any image
of what mankind is like...

304
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:25,579
then mankind cannot be allowed
to advance into space.

305
00:27:25,689 --> 00:27:27,714
What do you mean "cannot"?

306
00:27:28,425 --> 00:27:32,293
If necessary, General, I will stop it.

307
00:27:32,362 --> 00:27:33,351
How?

308
00:27:33,463 --> 00:27:36,330
By earthquake, tidal wave, volcano...

309
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,266
forces that will topple your civilization.

310
00:27:41,638 --> 00:27:43,128
I loathe the idea.

311
00:27:43,373 --> 00:27:44,362
Then why?

312
00:27:44,941 --> 00:27:47,705
I'm not a diplomat or a polite envoy.

313
00:27:48,645 --> 00:27:50,670
I am judge, jury...

314
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,915
and, if necessary, executioner.

315
00:28:32,455 --> 00:28:35,424
Babylon, Sodom and Gomorrah,
and your Barbary Coast.

316
00:28:35,492 --> 00:28:40,088
The names of the cities change,
but the squalor and crime do not.

317
00:28:44,401 --> 00:28:46,892
They have been in that meeting
45 minutes now.

318
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:48,938
You think Roosevelt will believe Andros?

319
00:28:49,005 --> 00:28:52,907
That he is from another planet?
I sure hope so. I think he will.

320
00:28:53,643 --> 00:28:57,044
He's been completely briefed
on everything that Andros has done...

321
00:28:57,113 --> 00:28:59,877
- and said.
- Do you know what I was just thinking?

322
00:29:00,183 --> 00:29:03,050
It's a lot more important
that Andros believe the President...

323
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:05,451
that we are men of good will...

324
00:29:05,588 --> 00:29:08,580
and even though we're
right in the middle of this World War...

325
00:29:08,658 --> 00:29:11,183
there still is hope for this planet.

326
00:29:14,898 --> 00:29:18,561
I want to speak to President Roosevelt
and some of the leaders of Congress.

327
00:29:19,536 --> 00:29:22,334
I'm not a diplomat or a polite envoy.

328
00:29:22,405 --> 00:29:24,805
I am judge, jury...

329
00:29:25,508 --> 00:29:27,066
and executioner.

330
00:29:30,113 --> 00:29:31,842
I wish they'd call.

331
00:29:32,282 --> 00:29:34,182
This waiting is getting to me.

332
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,775
There can't be too much longer now.

333
00:29:39,422 --> 00:29:40,821
Blankenship.

334
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,322
Yes, Mr. President.

335
00:29:44,461 --> 00:29:47,089
Yes, sir. I understand.

336
00:29:49,098 --> 00:29:50,827
The meeting's over.

337
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:54,493
The President says he has no doubt
that Andros is genuine.

338
00:29:55,305 --> 00:29:58,069
That also he could be
a very genuine threat.

339
00:29:58,908 --> 00:30:01,775
He's ordered me
to assemble a strike force...

340
00:30:02,712 --> 00:30:04,646
for use against Andros...

341
00:30:04,848 --> 00:30:06,338
if necessary.

342
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:14,217
It was good of you to wait
while I spoke with President Roosevelt.

343
00:30:15,658 --> 00:30:18,718
You know,
if my determination is negative...

344
00:30:18,995 --> 00:30:20,394
and I become a threat...

345
00:30:20,663 --> 00:30:22,339
they're going to try to kill me,
of course.

346
00:30:22,374 --> 00:30:23,830
And fail.

347
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:25,156
Of course.

348
00:30:26,603 --> 00:30:27,627
You understand?

349
00:30:28,338 --> 00:30:32,468
I understand that
I am Earth-born, Andros...

350
00:30:32,575 --> 00:30:35,305
this is my planet, my world.

351
00:30:35,545 --> 00:30:38,673
I know my mother, the Queen,
and my sisters on Paradise Island...

352
00:30:38,748 --> 00:30:40,716
would all agree with me.

353
00:30:42,051 --> 00:30:46,385
We cannot allow you to pass judgment
on Earth and destroy it.

354
00:30:47,123 --> 00:30:49,114
I hope you're successful.

355
00:30:52,161 --> 00:30:54,755
Tell me about your Paradise Island.

356
00:30:55,999 --> 00:30:59,196
It's beautiful, it's tranquil and peaceful.

357
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,765
It's outside of time, Andros.

358
00:31:03,406 --> 00:31:05,874
We cherish old ways.

359
00:31:06,543 --> 00:31:10,070
We are close with the ancient,
natural order of things.

360
00:31:12,849 --> 00:31:14,578
We live together...

361
00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:17,384
in harmony...

362
00:31:17,954 --> 00:31:19,922
with our living Earth.

363
00:31:20,924 --> 00:31:24,360
If these are basic in your beliefs,
why don't you stop this war?

364
00:31:24,561 --> 00:31:27,155
I would, but my powers are limited.

365
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:31,197
I'm trying. I've placed myself
on the side of the Allies to end it.

366
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:33,494
- By force?
- Lf it is necessary.

367
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:35,003
And is it?

368
00:31:35,171 --> 00:31:39,301
- Is this a war between good and evil?
- Yes, I think so.

369
00:31:40,343 --> 00:31:42,277
I'm not yet convinced.

370
00:31:42,712 --> 00:31:46,773
There may be neither good nor evil,
only degrees of savagery.

371
00:31:47,116 --> 00:31:50,142
No! You're wrong. There is a choice.

372
00:31:50,486 --> 00:31:53,853
And human beings must be allowed
to make that choice.

373
00:31:54,524 --> 00:31:57,960
I was chosen for this mission
because I didn't want it.

374
00:31:58,561 --> 00:32:00,222
I want to find hope.

375
00:32:00,663 --> 00:32:03,860
I want to see humankind grow
into a true civilization...

376
00:32:03,933 --> 00:32:06,299
into the great comity of planets.

377
00:32:06,369 --> 00:32:07,358
Trust me.

378
00:32:08,705 --> 00:32:11,299
And help me find a favorable answer.

379
00:32:11,674 --> 00:32:13,335
Will you trust me?

380
00:32:13,543 --> 00:32:15,374
Trust me to use my Golden Lasso...

381
00:32:15,445 --> 00:32:18,676
so that I may know
you're telling me the truth?

382
00:32:36,532 --> 00:32:39,365
- Have you told me the truth?
- Yes.

383
00:32:40,036 --> 00:32:44,029
If you judge Earth a danger or threat
to your Council of Planets...

384
00:32:44,574 --> 00:32:46,371
will you destroy it?

385
00:32:46,509 --> 00:32:49,535
- The Council will order it done.
- Can we stop you?

386
00:32:49,612 --> 00:32:51,239
No, I think not.

387
00:32:51,614 --> 00:32:53,411
And if you could...

388
00:32:53,483 --> 00:32:55,781
even though I'm monitored
by the Council...

389
00:32:55,852 --> 00:32:59,481
I must report via my spacecraft's comweb
every three of your days.

390
00:32:59,656 --> 00:33:03,786
If I am somehow killed or imprisoned
and the report is not made...

391
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,724
an orbiting battle satellite
will instantly attack.

392
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:09,994
And this planet will become
a barren cinder.

393
00:33:12,969 --> 00:33:15,164
I pray that will not happen.

394
00:33:17,573 --> 00:33:19,507
You've spoken the truth to me...

395
00:33:19,609 --> 00:33:22,669
but if it is necessary,
we will try to stop you.

396
00:33:24,213 --> 00:33:25,737
I understand.

397
00:33:26,049 --> 00:33:28,449
We can be honest with one other.

398
00:33:28,785 --> 00:33:30,776
We can trust one another.

399
00:33:31,921 --> 00:33:34,981
And for that I'm very grateful.

400
00:33:58,648 --> 00:33:59,637
Thanks, Harrison.

401
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,441
Keep him covered.

402
00:34:07,824 --> 00:34:09,416
What's going on?

403
00:34:09,492 --> 00:34:12,393
I thought that Andros was free to go
anywhere he likes.

404
00:34:12,462 --> 00:34:15,488
That's right,
we're just keeping an eye on him.

405
00:34:16,766 --> 00:34:19,633
And this strike force to assassinate him.

406
00:34:19,736 --> 00:34:22,933
Only as a last resort.
In case he tries to harm us.

407
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,001
If anything happens to Andros,
the Earth will be destroyed.

408
00:34:32,048 --> 00:34:35,540
Our only chance is to be honest with him,
to trust him...

409
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,944
not to make a hopeless attempt
to murder him.

410
00:34:39,522 --> 00:34:42,889
My assignment
is a logical military alternative...

411
00:34:43,192 --> 00:34:44,887
and a patriotic necessity.

412
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:49,762
To quote Dr. Samuel Johnson, "Patriotism
is the last refuge of scoundrels. "

413
00:34:51,234 --> 00:34:53,225
- Yeoman Prince.
- Yes, sir.

414
00:34:53,302 --> 00:34:55,497
- Dismissed.
- Aye-aye, sir.

415
00:35:02,278 --> 00:35:05,611
- Etta, this is confidential.
- Yes, sir. Absolutely.

416
00:35:11,487 --> 00:35:14,650
This is Strike Force, Alpha Wings, sir.
We've lost him.

417
00:36:23,693 --> 00:36:27,459
You realize that these humans
have armed soldiers following you?

418
00:36:27,563 --> 00:36:30,327
Yes, of course. I frighten them.

419
00:36:30,433 --> 00:36:33,925
But you still believe
they are capable of civilization?

420
00:36:34,737 --> 00:36:35,761
Yes.

421
00:36:38,074 --> 00:36:40,907
Then we have come to a decision, Andros.

422
00:36:41,444 --> 00:36:43,344
But the survey isn't complete.

423
00:36:43,412 --> 00:36:44,401
True.

424
00:36:44,614 --> 00:36:47,105
But we will refine the process.

425
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:50,017
If these primitives attack you...

426
00:36:50,086 --> 00:36:51,781
we will not intervene to help.

427
00:36:52,421 --> 00:36:54,981
You will survive or die alone.

428
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:57,649
I accept that.

429
00:36:58,127 --> 00:37:02,564
They're capable of suspicion,
but not mindless murder.

430
00:37:02,965 --> 00:37:05,490
But if they kill you, Andros...

431
00:37:05,568 --> 00:37:09,299
we'll destroy that planet
instantly and completely.

432
00:37:18,381 --> 00:37:20,781
No, I don't want a general alarm.

433
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:23,444
How'd you lose him in the first place?

434
00:37:24,053 --> 00:37:25,680
Just keep looking.

435
00:37:33,162 --> 00:37:35,096
Diana, I have a problem.

436
00:37:35,598 --> 00:37:38,123
- I'm sorry, Mr. Bjornsen.
- Paul, please.

437
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,792
Paul, what is it?

438
00:37:39,869 --> 00:37:41,632
It's a problem with Andros.

439
00:37:41,737 --> 00:37:44,501
I'm writing a feature about him
for my newspapers...

440
00:37:44,573 --> 00:37:47,440
but I have great respect for him,
and I want to be sure...

441
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:51,469
- he is treated correctly.
- I approve of that, Paul.

442
00:37:52,148 --> 00:37:55,140
So I'd like to talk to him personally...

443
00:37:55,217 --> 00:37:57,981
and I need your help to get to him.

444
00:37:58,054 --> 00:38:00,579
I'm afraid that's impossible, Mr. Bjornsen.

445
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:03,386
Major Trevor already told you
the matter is top-secret.

446
00:38:03,459 --> 00:38:07,589
I don't want to get any secrets,
just personal background.

447
00:38:08,097 --> 00:38:11,362
- I'm afraid not.
- But isn't it up to Andros?

448
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:12,656
Possibly.

449
00:38:13,202 --> 00:38:14,829
Afternoon, Etta.

450
00:38:15,137 --> 00:38:18,004
I have to talk to you for a second
about Andros.

451
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:21,900
Will you excuse us a moment?

452
00:38:23,612 --> 00:38:24,874
What is it?

453
00:38:24,947 --> 00:38:27,882
Steve wanted me to find you.
They've located Andros.

454
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:31,442
He's in the Library of Congress,
reading old books of all things.

455
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,988
We've sent one of our men
down there to watch him.

456
00:38:34,056 --> 00:38:36,115
Steve wanted you to go
and keep and eye on him.

457
00:38:36,192 --> 00:38:38,922
That way he wouldn't get too suspicious.

458
00:38:40,029 --> 00:38:43,055
- Something has come up.
- Of course.

459
00:38:43,132 --> 00:38:46,590
I understand. Wars have a way
of coming between people.

460
00:38:50,773 --> 00:38:53,367
Yes, we'll give each other a...

461
00:38:55,444 --> 00:38:57,435
- Rain check.
- A what?

462
00:38:57,513 --> 00:38:59,947
When you have to stop
in the middle of something...

463
00:39:00,016 --> 00:39:02,382
and you want to start again
as soon as possible.

464
00:39:03,285 --> 00:39:05,583
Yes, a rain check, it is.

465
00:39:06,122 --> 00:39:07,521
You've got it.

466
00:40:02,044 --> 00:40:03,306
Dr. Andros.

467
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,845
You will come with us.

468
00:40:11,454 --> 00:40:14,048
Us meaning a Swedish news service?

469
00:40:14,457 --> 00:40:16,789
We can discuss that later.

470
00:41:26,462 --> 00:41:29,761
You believed in these savages.
You were wrong.

471
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:32,600
- They haven't killed me.
- They will.

472
00:41:33,035 --> 00:41:35,833
We are canceling your power linkages.

473
00:41:35,905 --> 00:41:38,237
We are deactivating your power source.

474
00:41:38,741 --> 00:41:42,802
You trust these humans, you believe in
them, now you are no more than human.

475
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:46,109
As vulnerable as they are.
As easy to harm.

476
00:41:57,159 --> 00:41:58,387
Take him.

477
00:42:16,045 --> 00:42:18,639
We agreed to remove Andros' powers...

478
00:42:18,714 --> 00:42:22,810
to test his belief in these humans,
but now...

479
00:42:23,185 --> 00:42:25,346
I'm afraid they will harm him.

480
00:42:25,888 --> 00:42:29,016
Then he dies by his own choice.

481
00:42:29,658 --> 00:42:32,593
And in dying he makes the decision final.

482
00:42:34,163 --> 00:42:36,927
To rid the planet of the human disease.

483
00:42:51,547 --> 00:42:54,345
Then notify the White House
they've got Andros.

484
00:42:54,416 --> 00:42:58,011
I want all the local police
and the FBI on this. Out.

485
00:42:58,454 --> 00:43:00,945
- How's Wonder Woman?
- Alive, barely.

486
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:04,987
How does Paul Bjornsen figure in all this?

487
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,824
We managed to grab one of his men.
He's talking now.

488
00:43:08,664 --> 00:43:11,189
He is a Nazi.
A deep spy planted years ago...

489
00:43:11,267 --> 00:43:13,758
until something important enough
came along.

490
00:43:15,938 --> 00:43:19,305
Can't think of anybody more important.
But don't worry, we'll get him.

491
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:21,366
I got a description of the truck
they left in.

492
00:43:21,443 --> 00:43:24,412
It's being sent to every police force
from Florida to Nova Scotia.

493
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,040
I realize a truck that size
can't manage some back roads.

494
00:43:27,116 --> 00:43:29,744
But this was planned
and I'm sure they'll change vehicles.

495
00:43:29,818 --> 00:43:32,912
I want a police checkpoint
on every road, track or cowpath...

496
00:43:32,988 --> 00:43:34,546
leading out of here. Is that clear?

497
00:43:35,457 --> 00:43:38,620
General, with your permission
I'd like to go the base clinic now.

498
00:43:39,094 --> 00:43:42,427
Of course, I'm praying for her, too.

499
00:43:58,914 --> 00:44:01,109
Etta, have you heard anything
about Wonder Woman?

500
00:44:01,183 --> 00:44:04,584
I just spoke to the doctor.
It seems she got hit by a poison gas.

501
00:44:04,653 --> 00:44:07,417
- They don't know what it is.
- What treatment are they using?

502
00:44:07,489 --> 00:44:09,013
There is no treatment.

503
00:44:09,091 --> 00:44:12,254
It seems she has an incredible ability
to throw off the poison.

504
00:44:12,528 --> 00:44:14,496
She's curing herself!

505
00:44:14,797 --> 00:44:17,357
They got Andros. Bjornsen.

506
00:44:17,633 --> 00:44:19,965
That's right. He's a Nazi agent.

507
00:44:20,135 --> 00:44:21,796
We've already rounded up some people...

508
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:24,464
and the most massive search in history
is going on now.

509
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:28,007
He must've had this
very carefully planned.

510
00:44:28,077 --> 00:44:29,942
Including the escape.

511
00:44:33,015 --> 00:44:35,108
We have to get Andros back.

512
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:38,952
If the Council of Planets is monitoring
what's been happening...

513
00:44:39,021 --> 00:44:41,546
they might launch an attack on the Earth
and destroy it.

514
00:44:41,623 --> 00:44:43,784
We've got to find a way
to message to them...

515
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:47,556
- to tell them we'll try to save Andros.
- But how can we do that?

516
00:44:48,364 --> 00:44:51,060
I know there's communication equipment
on the spaceship.

517
00:44:51,133 --> 00:44:53,567
We were never able to find the spaceship.

518
00:44:57,039 --> 00:44:58,267
Careful.

519
00:45:01,176 --> 00:45:02,438
I'm all right.

520
00:45:03,412 --> 00:45:07,405
I have to find the spacecraft
and a way to send that message.

521
00:45:08,384 --> 00:45:12,343
You can't go now. You've been poisoned.
It's much too early to leave the hospital.

522
00:45:12,721 --> 00:45:14,484
Steve, I'm going...

523
00:45:14,556 --> 00:45:17,491
to find the spacecraft myself.
I'm all right.

524
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:21,421
We've searched that area a dozen times
and come up empty a dozen times.

525
00:45:21,563 --> 00:45:25,090
I know which direction he came from
and where he was first seen.

526
00:45:25,634 --> 00:45:29,092
I have to make one final search, for him.

527
00:45:30,539 --> 00:45:33,167
If I don't it might be fatal for Earth.

528
00:47:19,114 --> 00:47:22,914
One of the primitives is trying
to activate Andros' key control.

529
00:47:22,985 --> 00:47:24,509
Let her, Gorel.

530
00:47:24,586 --> 00:47:26,452
If the correct signal isn't set,

531
00:47:26,453 --> 00:47:29,319
the satellite would automatically
destroy their planet.

532
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,254
We won't have to bother.

533
00:48:37,759 --> 00:48:38,748
