[man speaking Chinese]
What the?!

5
00:01:34,854 --> 00:01:37,393
Get out of my truck!
Get out of my truck!

6
00:01:38,462 --> 00:01:39,989
You think you can
just get a free ride?

7
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:41,793
Get out of here!

8
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,300
Asshole!

00:02:00,983 --> 00:02:02,847
[clucking]

10
00:02:24,504 --> 00:02:27,311
[man speaking Chinese] Who put you
up to this? Why are you doing this?

11
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,677
You could have it easy,
but instead you end up doing this?

12
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,289
Wang?!

13
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:40,720
Have you lost your mind?

14
00:02:42,422 --> 00:02:44,289
I can't believe it's you!

15
00:02:44,358 --> 00:02:46,297
Who told you to do this?

16
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:49,195
Your replacement is coming soon.

17
00:02:49,264 --> 00:02:50,565
This is a necessity.

18
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:52,231
This can't be!

19
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,964
You are my people!

20
00:02:57,537 --> 00:02:59,409
You will not be missed.

[gunshot]

22
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:05,574
[in English] Fuck!

23
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,071
Fuck!

24
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:11,283
Why don't you just
play the slice?

25
00:04:16,182 --> 00:04:17,953
Oh, so we're going to do one
for each nine, then?

26
00:04:18,022 --> 00:04:19,153
Yes, we are.

27
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:21,958
I am paying for the round,
I get as many as I want!

28
00:04:22,027 --> 00:04:25,891
Just like you! How many incomplete
classes am I paying for, huh?

29
00:04:26,898 --> 00:04:27,928
All right.

30
00:04:28,464 --> 00:04:30,000
I fucked up, okay? I coasted.

31
00:04:30,068 --> 00:04:31,635
"I co... I coasted"?!

32
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:35,129
Jesus.
"I co... I coasted."

33
00:04:35,198 --> 00:04:36,972
Look, it's just not
that interesting.

34
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,970
[scoffs] Ha!

35
00:04:41,044 --> 00:04:42,281
[sighs]

36
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:52,683
Now, you are not only here
for me to bust your balls,

37
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:54,986
which I am and you deserve,

38
00:04:55,055 --> 00:04:56,923
but unfortunately I am running
out of money

39
00:04:56,992 --> 00:04:59,364
and I'm gonna need a favor,
which you will do for me.

40
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:02,697
So...

41
00:05:03,231 --> 00:05:04,226
what...

42
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:05,700
exactly...

43
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,265
are you proposing?

44
00:05:11,306 --> 00:05:12,500
Gah... damn.

45
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:17,248
You're going to help me with a housing
project my company... or I'm... doing.

46
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:22,543
- Urban housing development.
- Oh, like as an advisor to a project manager or something?

47
00:05:22,612 --> 00:05:23,747
No!

48
00:05:23,816 --> 00:05:25,181
Do you know how to do that?

49
00:05:26,022 --> 00:05:27,057
No!

50
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,186
I would not send you over there
to make me look like a dick.

51
00:05:31,491 --> 00:05:32,529
Get the tee.

52
00:05:34,365 --> 00:05:35,961
So then what would I be doing?

[older man]
<i>You're a substitute for me,</i>

54
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,801
<i>but only your boss
over there knows it.</i>

55
00:05:46,837 --> 00:05:49,078
<i>The others won't know it because
it would make them lose face,</i>

56
00:05:49,146 --> 00:05:52,076
<i>which is basically the worst
possible thing in China.</i>

57
00:05:53,017 --> 00:05:54,045
<i>A fake.</i>

58
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:57,615
Hello, Mr. Bryan,
my name is Lia.

59
00:05:57,683 --> 00:05:59,117
Charmed to meet you, Lia.

60

Thank you for taking the time
to come get me.

<i>You'll be in another country

68

<i>you look good
and say "I approve."</i>

69
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,781
<i>It'll impress their
Chinese investors.</i>

70
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,684
<i>That's the real trick,
that's the rub... again,</i>

71
00:06:28,752 --> 00:06:30,615
<i>almost all of the people
at this company</i>

72
00:06:30,684 --> 00:06:32,348
<i>won't know your role.</i>

73
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:35,555
<i>Only the guy at the top,
who got you from me.</i>

74
00:06:36,258 --> 00:06:39,431
<i>They are paying you
to be white and look the part;</i>

75
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,565

Coco Chen.

79
00:06:58,248 --> 00:07:00,049
Nice to meet you!

80
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:01,150
How are you?

81
00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:03,054
I'm fine, thank you.

82
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:04,648
You look so handsome...

Uh... anything you need help,
call me, okay?

86
00:07:10,688 --> 00:07:11,727
Okay.

87
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,397
It is my pleasure
to introduce you,

88
00:07:15,466 --> 00:07:17,897
Mr. Wang Lee, your employer.

89
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,396
- How do you do?
- I'm very well, thank you, Mr. Zellerman.

90
00:07:21,465 --> 00:07:23,904
Welcome to Shanghai.
Please, come with me.

91
00:07:25,443 --> 00:07:27,506
I'm sure you had a long flight.

92
00:07:28,109 --> 00:07:30,944
We are so very glad you could
come to help us.

93
00:07:32,214 --> 00:07:34,917
Well, I'm looking forward to
exceeding your expectations.

94
00:07:35,587 --> 00:07:38,086
Let's not play any games,
Mr. Bryan.

95
00:07:38,155 --> 00:07:41,650
I'm perfectly aware you're not
qualified for this position,

96
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:44,520
and that is precisely why
the company has hired you.

97
00:07:44,588 --> 00:07:47,961
Frankly, I don't care
what you did at your last job.

98
00:07:49,393 --> 00:07:51,965
I promise
there's nothing I can't handle.

99
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:58,103
My company is going
through some major changes.

100
00:07:58,172 --> 00:08:00,974
We unfortunately lost our last
managing CFO.

101

<i>Anything they buy becomes
an immediate status symbol.</i>

112
00:08:34,545 --> 00:08:35,977
<i>Just having you next to me</i>

113
00:08:36,046 --> 00:08:37,213
<i>increases the value
of our developments</i>

114
00:08:37,282 --> 00:08:38,512
<i>by 30 percent.</i>

115
00:08:39,515 --> 00:08:43,588
And of course, as you know,
we will compensate you handsomely.

116
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:46,156
Lia will show you to your
new accommodation.

117
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,485
Have a good evening.

What did he just say?

- Oh, so that's what "laowai" means?
- How you know?

Because that's the only thing people

Mm-hmm.

176
00:15:33,462 --> 00:15:35,664
[Lia] I hope you're
enjoying yourself so far.

177
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:37,397
[Bryan] So far, so good!

178
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:51,576
What do you think of our new
luxury condo, Mr. Bryan?

179
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,677
Well, it's beautiful.

180
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:55,415
How many does it hold?

181
00:15:56,082 --> 00:15:57,713
About 20,000,

182
00:15:57,782 --> 00:15:59,087
but that's nothing
compared to the one

183
00:15:59,156 --> 00:16:00,385
we're building
across the street.

184
00:16:00,454 --> 00:16:01,960
That one will fit
about twice as many.

185
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,326
The newly rich Chinese
love things like these:

186
00:16:08,394 --> 00:16:10,928
stadiums, parks, luxury condos,

187
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:13,862
anything they can
burn their money on.

188
00:16:15,665 --> 00:16:18,267
You know,
you do good here,

189
00:16:18,336 --> 00:16:19,604
you'll be rewarded.

190
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:23,938
You are quite the honest
businessman.

191
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,019
See that house down there?

192
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:30,615
Our company bought
the whole block, but...

193
00:16:30,684 --> 00:16:32,348
- sometimes people won't leave.
- [dog barking]

194
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,025
We call them nail houses.

195
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,819
So, how do you get rid of them?

196
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,296
You can pry them out
or hammer them in.

197
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:43,199
We always find a way.

198
00:16:45,268 --> 00:16:46,862
What about the people
you remove?

199
00:17:31,915 --> 00:17:32,941
[in Chinese] Come out!

200
00:17:34,652 --> 00:17:35,779
Come out!

201
00:17:37,884 --> 00:17:39,957
You know you can't do this,
this house has belonged

202
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:41,485
to my family for generations.
We paid!

203
00:17:41,553 --> 00:17:43,685
You can't do anything about it!

204
00:17:43,754 --> 00:17:46,095
This is illegal!
I have my rights!

205
00:17:46,164 --> 00:17:49,067
- Shut up! Get him outside!
- [grunts]

206
00:17:50,828 --> 00:17:53,137

207
00:17:54,165 --> 00:17:55,205
Shut up!

208
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:08,914
[in English] Food? [grunts]

209
00:18:09,516 --> 00:18:11,485
Can you understand
what I'm saying?

210
00:18:14,189 --> 00:18:16,457
I'm... I'm very hungry.

Welcome to your new apartment.

00:20:27,057 --> 00:20:28,622
We have four bedrooms,

So is there anything else
I can help you with?

241
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:01,657
Well, this seems like a cause
for celebration.

00:30:42,331 --> 00:30:44,468
I mean, you read Chinese.

350
00:30:45,936 --> 00:30:46,976
No.

351
00:30:47,877 --> 00:30:49,176
Why'd you take this job then?

352
00:30:51,441 --> 00:30:53,015
I'm glad I can't read this.

353
00:30:56,778 --> 00:30:59,857
- Shh.
- [chuckles] Oh... I'm sorry.

354
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:04,752
[knocking]

355
00:31:13,133 --> 00:31:14,905
You're efficient, Mr. Bryan.

356
00:31:15,901 --> 00:31:16,940
Guilty!

357
00:31:17,643 --> 00:31:20,469
Is there any way you could...

358
00:31:20,538 --> 00:31:22,875
brief me?
Tonight before the meeting?

359
00:31:23,511 --> 00:31:26,675
I would be happy to.
You can come with me, please.

360
00:31:28,014 --> 00:31:30,844
[boat horn blares]

361
00:31:38,822 --> 00:31:41,525
[Bryan] The... weather changes
so quickly here.

362
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,759
It's very foggy today.

363
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,529
Everything changes so quickly,

364
00:31:47,598 --> 00:31:49,938
and unfortunately
this is not a fog.

365
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:54,674
- Oh.
- Mr. Bryan, you can see the office from here, look.

366
00:31:54,743 --> 00:31:56,210
[Bryan] Wow.

367
00:31:57,009 --> 00:31:58,205
Very impressive.

368
00:31:58,274 --> 00:31:59,312
Yeah, sure.

369
00:32:03,885 --> 00:32:04,922
Do you not like your job?

370
00:32:05,922 --> 00:32:07,386
It's okay! You can tell me.

371
00:32:08,389 --> 00:32:10,752
I've worked plenty
of jobs that I hated.

372
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:15,931
The company you work for
built this place,

373
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:20,102
I think you've done something
right to be here today.

374
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:24,531
But it does take
a certain type of person

375
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,669
to do what we do, does it not?

376
00:32:27,204 --> 00:32:28,770
Come along.

377
00:32:41,153 --> 00:32:45,021
[Lia] Don't mind the cameras,
white people are like celebrities here.

378
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:47,591
[Bryan] It's like in China,
you can be a fake white anything.

379
00:32:48,094 --> 00:32:50,700
[chuckles] I mean, at least I'm
not pretending to be a doctor.

380
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:52,459
[Lia] That happens all the time.

381
00:32:52,829 --> 00:32:54,434
[Bryan]
Isn't this... totally unethical?

382
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,705
[Lia] For who?
Are you complaining?

383
00:32:58,608 --> 00:33:00,868
[Bryan] <i>I guess I didn't
realize it was so normal.</i>

384
00:33:02,604 --> 00:33:03,703
<i>Does it bother you?</i>

385
00:33:03,772 --> 00:33:05,346
[Lia] <i>Personally I don't care,</i>

386
00:33:05,415 --> 00:33:07,948
<i>everything you see in China
is fake anyway.</i>

387
00:33:08,017 --> 00:33:09,516
[Bryan] <i>Counterfeit goods?</i>

388
00:33:09,986 --> 00:33:11,318
[Lia] <i>Counterfeit life.</i>

389
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:15,217
We own factories,
shipping depots,

390
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:17,060
almost everything.

391
00:33:18,923 --> 00:33:20,756
[Bryan] <i>These people look
like they live here.</i>

392
00:33:20,824 --> 00:33:23,294
[Lia] <i>Yes, they are very
successful.</i>

393
00:33:23,363 --> 00:33:24,958
[Bryan] <i>Yeah? Compared to what?</i>

394
00:33:33,004 --> 00:33:35,702
[Lia] <i>A hundred people live
above this factory</i>

395
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,778
<i>and work six days per week.</i>

396
00:33:37,847 --> 00:33:41,646
They are skilled laborers,
they get paid more than day laborers,

397
00:33:41,714 --> 00:33:44,351
uh, but they still
cannot work in the offices.

398
00:33:45,384 --> 00:33:46,914
Well, that doesn't seem fair.

399
00:33:47,949 --> 00:33:49,484
They don't mind
if they don't know

400
00:33:49,553 --> 00:33:50,885
that an alternative exists.

401
00:33:52,492 --> 00:33:53,889
Don't these people
rarely interact

402
00:33:53,957 --> 00:33:56,128
with anyone outside of
their own little world?

403
00:33:56,197 --> 00:33:57,727
It is the most efficient method.

404
00:33:57,795 --> 00:33:59,493
The Chinese have been
employing this way

405
00:33:59,561 --> 00:34:00,895
for a thousand years.

406
00:34:02,338 --> 00:34:03,663
[Bryan] So what are they
producing here?

407
00:34:04,132 --> 00:34:07,276
Boxes mostly,
for shipping our commodities.

408
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:09,406
Ah, that's very interesting
to see it in action.

409
00:34:09,475 --> 00:34:10,839
This is where the magic
happens.

410
00:34:38,167 --> 00:34:40,935
You'll be pleased to hear
your replacement is working.

411
00:34:41,845 --> 00:34:42,871
We'll start in a week.

412
00:34:46,276 --> 00:34:47,315
Tomorrow.

413
00:34:48,718 --> 00:34:53,354
Excuse me? Are you advising
me or telling me what to do?

414
00:34:53,423 --> 00:34:56,423
Our original plans were to start
days from now.

415
00:34:57,758 --> 00:34:59,925
Well, the plans
have gotta change, hadn't they?

416
00:35:00,528 --> 00:35:02,523
You really think
they're not watching us

417
00:35:02,591 --> 00:35:04,326
this very fucking second?

418
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:07,898
- [camera shutter clicks]
- The documents will be released tomorrow.

419
00:35:09,102 --> 00:35:11,702
We've already harvested his
signatures and his fingerprints.

420
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,842
[man in Chinese]
I've never seen this guy before.

421
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:15,868
[woman in Chinese] They didn't hide,
none of our cameras were blocked.

422
00:35:15,937 --> 00:35:17,310
It's like they don't care
suddenly.

423
00:35:17,379 --> 00:35:18,808
They're brazenly
strutting around...

424
00:35:18,877 --> 00:35:21,149
it's like they don't care
we're monitoring them.

425
00:35:21,218 --> 00:35:23,278
Their patterns have
changed recently.

426
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,412
Now it's meeting after meeting,
it's strange.

427
00:35:26,881 --> 00:35:28,724
It used to be just once a week.

428
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:31,385
Except for last weekend when he
left for the mountains alone,

429
00:35:31,454 --> 00:35:35,864
he's constantly under the guard
of that mean-looking foreigner.

430
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:38,498
The new manager
of their company was seen

431
00:35:38,566 --> 00:35:39,994
leaving this foreigner's
apartment the other day.

432
00:35:40,063 --> 00:35:42,203
[man] I want to check
the surveillance records.

433
00:35:42,272 --> 00:35:44,431
I don't know who
they're working for,

434
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,704
but I'm sure that other American
in the suit, I believe...

435
00:35:47,805 --> 00:35:49,773
he's the key
to unlock this puzzle.

436
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,914
[in English] Make sure they find
him, not you!

437
00:35:53,983 --> 00:35:55,715
Don't fuck this up!

438
00:35:55,784 --> 00:35:58,353
Don't want to take another
trip to the country, do we?

439
00:36:04,421 --> 00:36:05,525
You still here?

440
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:13,830
[vehicle approaching]

441
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:17,702
[horn honks]

442
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:25,908
- [in Chinese] Hop on!
- [in English] Bad idea.

443
00:36:31,152 --> 00:36:32,189
[in Chinese] Don't worry!

444
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,990
- [Bryan in English] Where are we going?
- To my old neighborhood.

445
00:37:55,434 --> 00:37:56,801
[no audible dialogue]

446
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:08,846
[indistinct chatter]

447
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,323
[in English]
What do you call this?

448
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:17,426
- Yia me gur.
- Yia me gur.

449
00:38:18,094 --> 00:38:19,120
[in English] Good?

450
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:24,862
[in Chinese] It's pronounced
"jia mei gur."

451
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,528
- [in Chinese] Take it?
- [in Chinese] Take it.

452
00:38:29,597 --> 00:38:30,868
Take it?

453
00:38:35,111 --> 00:38:36,808
[indistinct chatter]

454
00:38:38,642 --> 00:38:39,712
[in Chinese] Try it?

455
00:38:41,948 --> 00:38:43,452
- [in English] It's good.
- [in Chinese] Try it.

456
00:38:45,852 --> 00:38:48,223
- You give it to him.
- [in Chinese] Thank you.

457
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,856
- [broken English] Thank you.
- [in Chinese] Thank you!

458
00:38:50,925 --> 00:38:52,454
- [broken English] Thank you!
- [in Chinese] Thank you.

459
00:38:52,522 --> 00:38:54,958
[laughter]

460
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:19,818
[woman in Chinese] Eight or
four, buy eight or four!

461
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,656
[indistinct chatter]

462
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:37,539
[sizzling]

463
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:44,337
- [in Chinese] Do you Americans have or not?
- Mm...

464
00:39:45,881 --> 00:39:47,744
- [in Chinese] Smells good!
- [in Chinese] Smells good?

465
00:39:47,813 --> 00:39:49,750
- Smells good. Ah.
- Smells good.

466
00:39:49,819 --> 00:39:51,949
- [in English] Tell him.
- [in Chinese] Smells good!

467
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:58,287
[in English]
No, not interested.

468
00:39:58,355 --> 00:39:59,823
- [in English] You have to say it louder.
- Louder?

469
00:39:59,892 --> 00:40:01,589
[in Chinese]
Smells good, master!

470
00:40:01,657 --> 00:40:03,695
- Always smells good!
- [in Chinese] Smells good, master!

471
00:40:03,764 --> 00:40:04,992
[in Chinese]
Today, you eat these two,

472
00:40:05,061 --> 00:40:06,600
but when you go
back to America,

473
00:40:06,669 --> 00:40:08,867
you won't be able to get
this good of food!

474
00:40:11,768 --> 00:40:13,234
[no audible dialogue]

475
00:40:22,077 --> 00:40:23,352
[Yuen-Ling in English] Meat.

476
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,281
- [in English] Meat!
- Meat... uh, dry.

477
00:40:25,784 --> 00:40:28,320
Spicy? Hot?
Yeah, one.

478
00:40:28,389 --> 00:40:31,186
[in Chinese] One! Yes, one, please.
Yeah, with that... and that...

479
00:40:31,254 --> 00:40:33,363
- Do you want meat or no meat?
- Uh, yeah.

480
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:34,787
- And this you'd like?
- A little bit.

481
00:40:34,856 --> 00:40:35,888
A little bit.

482
00:40:36,591 --> 00:40:38,198
- [Yuen-Ling in English] You like?
- [Bryan] Uh-huh.

483
00:40:38,266 --> 00:40:39,601
[Bryan chuckle]

484
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,637
[Bryan in English]
Is that... meat?

485
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,502
[in Chinese] Great, thank you!

486
00:40:49,471 --> 00:40:50,903
- [in Chinese] How much?
- [in Chinese] Three kwai.

487
00:40:50,972 --> 00:40:52,614
[indistinct chatter]

488
00:40:54,249 --> 00:40:56,849
- [in English] Oh, what, now you don't want it?
- [laughing]

489
00:40:58,988 --> 00:41:00,248
Ooh!

490
00:41:07,261 --> 00:41:11,595
[in English] Do your parents
know that you're dating a laowai?

491
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,700
- [in English] Me?!
- Yeah, you!

492
00:41:13,769 --> 00:41:16,264
Laowai?
Laowai, yeah, you and laowai!

493
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,508
Let's see...

494
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:23,304
[horn honks]

495
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,850
[truck honking]

496
00:41:42,432 --> 00:41:43,665
[in Chinese] Hurry, let's go.

497
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:46,294
[engine revs]

498
00:42:05,019 --> 00:42:06,584
[Yuen-Ling in Chinese]
Why did we come here?

499
00:42:07,321 --> 00:42:09,350
- [in Chinese] Don't worry about it.
- Don't worry?

500
00:42:10,524 --> 00:42:11,990
I don't like this.

501
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:13,826
[in English] Uncle said
he worked here before...

502
00:42:13,895 --> 00:42:15,728
[in English] Your uncle,
he worked here?

503
00:42:15,797 --> 00:42:17,060
- [in Chinese] Yeah.
- At this company?

504
00:42:17,129 --> 00:42:18,934
[in Chinese] Yeah.
Let's go. Let's go.

505
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:21,901
- He told me not to come here.
- [in English] Okay-la, okay.

506
00:42:34,742 --> 00:42:36,279
[in Chinese] I'm not getting
much cooperation here.

507
00:42:36,348 --> 00:42:39,352
Pull up the footage of
all the entrances and exits.

508
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,351
[in Chinese] We've looked at that
footage for the entire day, sir.

509
00:42:42,419 --> 00:42:44,654
We never saw him use any
of the entrances or exits.

510
00:42:44,723 --> 00:42:45,987
Re-checking three times.

511
00:42:46,056 --> 00:42:48,463
Can we please check once more?

512
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:50,326
You've lost track
of people before,

513
00:42:50,394 --> 00:42:53,097
so what's the harm in reviewing
one more time?

514
00:42:53,166 --> 00:42:56,362
- It's been two weeks!
- If I took another look,

515
00:42:56,431 --> 00:43:00,641
I guarantee that
I will find something!

516
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:03,941
- I'll wait.
- Sir, that footage you asked for a week ago,

517
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:06,045
- it's here.
- From which cameras?

518
00:43:06,114 --> 00:43:08,147
When the car carrying Wang Zhou
last left Shanghai

519
00:43:08,216 --> 00:43:10,147
got spotted and you wanted
to know who was with him.

520
00:43:13,015 --> 00:43:15,114
[monitor trilling]

521
00:43:15,182 --> 00:43:16,624
[man] That's strange.

522
00:43:16,693 --> 00:43:18,791
All of these are
construction sites.

523
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,828
Cross-reference this list
in our database.

524
00:43:21,396 --> 00:43:22,423
[mouths] Okay.

525
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:28,632
[in English] Oh, shit.

526
00:43:28,701 --> 00:43:30,839
[in Chinese] I didn't notice this before!
These are all locations

527
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:33,104
where evicted residents have
been reported missing.

528
00:43:34,911 --> 00:43:38,109
We need to capture
this foreigner immediately!

529
00:43:47,053 --> 00:43:48,320
[in English]
Good morning, laowai.

530
00:43:48,989 --> 00:43:50,488
[in Chinese]
Zaoshang hao, laowai.

531
00:43:50,557 --> 00:43:52,123
[both chuckle]

532
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,423
[in English]
Today is a special day.

533
00:43:54,925 --> 00:43:55,962
[in English] Special day?

534
00:43:58,426 --> 00:44:01,168
[chuckles]
You don't like my beard?

535
00:44:01,237 --> 00:44:02,502
Um...

536
00:44:02,571 --> 00:44:03,766
- Mm...
- [chuckles]

537
00:44:03,835 --> 00:44:05,074
Too much, too much.

538
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:07,039
No. Hao, hao!

539
00:44:07,738 --> 00:44:09,772
Hmm? Hmm?

540
00:44:10,508 --> 00:44:13,242
- [In Chinese] Thank you.
- [In Chinese] Listen to this.

541
00:44:13,311 --> 00:44:16,085
[broken English]
Today, we two... two...

542
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:18,019
go train station.

543
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:20,081
- [in English] Train, train?
- [in English] Train, train.

544
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:21,988
[in Chinese] Oh, good! Good!

545
00:44:26,626 --> 00:44:28,462
- Good-a?
- Mm!

546
00:44:28,531 --> 00:44:30,623
- Good-a!
- [chuckles]

547
00:44:35,933 --> 00:44:37,707
[indistinct chatter]

548
00:45:01,693 --> 00:45:04,566
[Yuen-Ling in English] Today
is a special day, remember?

549
00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:09,871
- [Bryan in English] Why?
- [Yuen-Ling] We are going to a place with no people.

550
00:45:17,878 --> 00:45:19,443
[Bryan in English] Holy shit.

551
00:45:19,512 --> 00:45:22,246
- Are we still in China?
- [in Chinese] I like it here.

552
00:45:25,346 --> 00:45:26,382
[in English] Holy shit.

553
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:29,055
[chuckling]

554
00:45:31,323 --> 00:45:32,692
[Yuen-Ling in English]
Keep umbrella up!

555
00:45:33,261 --> 00:45:36,931
- [in English] Why?
- If no umbrella, hair fall out!

556
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:38,867
[Bryan] Wait, what?

557
00:45:39,765 --> 00:45:40,860
There's no noise.

558
00:45:41,429 --> 00:45:42,904
[in Chinese] Yeah, I like it.

559
00:45:44,671 --> 00:45:47,269
[Bryan in English] I can see
why, this place is beautiful.

560
00:45:47,938 --> 00:45:51,671
[in Chinese] So you never told
me, what brought you to China?

561
00:45:52,407 --> 00:45:53,839
[in Chinese] Um... I don't know.

562
00:45:54,775 --> 00:45:56,946
[Bryan] How long did you live
near here?

563
00:45:57,783 --> 00:45:59,789
[Yuen-Ling in Chinese] We had
already moved to this area.

564
00:45:59,858 --> 00:46:02,886
When I was a kid,
this place didn't even look

565
00:46:02,954 --> 00:46:04,656
like a town back then.

566
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:08,061
[Bryan in Chinese] Ah, uh...
Was that good or bad?

567
00:46:08,263 --> 00:46:09,829
- [in Chinese] It was fine.
- [in Chinese] It was fine.

568
00:46:09,897 --> 00:46:11,834
But I don't like the city much.

569
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,569
[Yuen-Ling in English]
When I was little,

570
00:46:15,637 --> 00:46:18,269
my parents have no money.

571
00:46:19,102 --> 00:46:20,843
So I can only read books.

572
00:46:21,809 --> 00:46:23,274
That's how I fix your leg.

573
00:46:24,877 --> 00:46:27,113
[in English] A laowai doctor!
[in Chinese] Big money, big money!

574
00:46:31,479 --> 00:46:35,253
[in English] You are the first person
that has ever been truly kind to me.

575
00:46:36,558 --> 00:46:38,256
[chuckling]

576
00:46:42,996 --> 00:46:44,158
[in English] Do you understand?

577
00:46:44,226 --> 00:46:46,000
[no audible dialogue]

578
00:46:48,802 --> 00:46:50,037
Why did you help me?

579
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,742
You were hurt and sad,

580
00:46:56,810 --> 00:46:58,507
that's why I'll help you.

581
00:47:03,685 --> 00:47:05,481
[no audible dialogue]

582
00:47:13,262 --> 00:47:14,855
[Bryan in English]
I wish this was my real life.

583
00:47:15,824 --> 00:47:17,395
[Yuen-Ling in English]
What is your real life?

584
00:47:18,164 --> 00:47:19,462
[Bryan]
I don't want to tell you.

585
00:47:19,531 --> 00:47:21,631
[Yuen-Ling]
You have to tell me sometime.

586
00:47:22,034 --> 00:47:23,431
[Bryan] I know, I know.

587
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,906
[in Chinese]
Don't worry, don't worry.

588
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:26,334
[Yuen in broken English]
My family no like.

589
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:30,773
They want a normal life for me.
They don't like you.

590
00:47:30,842 --> 00:47:32,712
[Bryan in English] Well,
your father never met me, so...

591
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,477
What is, what is he like?

592
00:47:34,545 --> 00:47:36,917
[Yuen-Ling] He's old.
He works too much.

593
00:47:36,986 --> 00:47:40,382
- Now he's working somewhere...
- Oh.

594
00:47:40,451 --> 00:47:42,584
- ...in another city.
- Is he far away?

595
00:47:42,653 --> 00:47:45,421
[Yuen-Ling] Yes, yes.
It's normal in China.

596
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:48,491
We don't see our parents.
Only once a year.

597
00:47:54,505 --> 00:47:56,367
[indistinct chatter]

598
00:48:26,662 --> 00:48:29,771
[in English] Hey! Hey!
How are you?

599
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,138
- [barks]
- Hey, shh, shh, shh, shh.

600
00:48:32,207 --> 00:48:34,875
You're a good boy.
You're a good boy!

601
00:48:34,943 --> 00:48:36,979
You're okay.
You're okay.

602
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:40,143
Yeah, there you are.
There you are, pup.

603
00:48:40,212 --> 00:48:41,847
There you are, pup, how are you?

604
00:48:41,916 --> 00:48:44,213
How are you?
Good boy!

605
00:48:44,282 --> 00:48:46,989
Good boy! Okay.
Bye-bye!

606
00:48:51,059 --> 00:48:55,965
[Lee in Chinese] Everything that they
want I've got on me here at the factory.

607
00:48:58,292 --> 00:49:00,398
[in English] What do you mean
you haven't found him yet?

608
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:02,800
What am I paying you for?

609
00:49:03,402 --> 00:49:05,942
I don't care,
just make it happen!

610
00:49:14,211 --> 00:49:15,908

611
00:49:35,168 --> 00:49:37,138

614
00:50:41,135 --> 00:50:44,104

do last night? [in English] You okay?

615
00:50:44,173 --> 00:50:45,701
[in English] Yeah, I'm okay.
Um...

616
00:50:46,536 --> 00:50:47,741
I need to talk to you, though.

619
00:50:58,045 --> 00:50:59,750
[Yuen-Ling in Chinese]
Very good food.

620
00:50:59,818 --> 00:51:01,422
[broken English] Favorite restaurant.
Best restaurant?

621
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:03,450
- [Bryan in English] Yeah, yeah.
- [in Chinese] This way.

622
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:05,556
- It's my favorite restaurant.
- [in Chinese] Good. Got it, got it.

623
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,956
- [in Chinese] It's this way.
- [in Chinese] Good. Got it, got it.

624
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,266
[siren chirps]

625
00:51:13,898 --> 00:51:16,103
[in English] Um... let's go,
let's go back this way.

626
00:51:16,172 --> 00:51:17,866
[in Chinese]
No, it's over there!

627
00:51:17,934 --> 00:51:19,634
[in English] Yeah, no, no,
come on, I mean it.

628
00:51:19,703 --> 00:51:20,967
[Yuen-Ling in English]
Wait, stop!

629
00:51:38,555 --> 00:51:43,396
[traditional music playing]

630
00:51:54,274 --> 00:51:55,309
[Yuen-Ling in English] Wait!

631
00:51:56,412 --> 00:51:58,640
What happened?
[in Chinese] What are you doing?

632
00:51:58,709 --> 00:52:00,413
[in English]
Why are you like this?

633
00:52:02,276 --> 00:52:04,444
[in English] There's people
who are looking for me.

634
00:52:05,547 --> 00:52:08,490
- [in Chinese] What? Who... Police?
- [in English] No! No, no, no.

635
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:11,823
I didn't do anything,
but the company that I worked for

636
00:52:11,892 --> 00:52:14,225
is the same company as your
father, and they lied.

637
00:52:14,294 --> 00:52:15,725
They said that I did things,

638
00:52:15,794 --> 00:52:18,167
but I didn't do them.
I didn't do anything.

639
00:52:19,431 --> 00:52:21,500
That's how I came to your shop.

640
00:52:23,433 --> 00:52:24,464
[in Chinese] Really?

641
00:52:24,966 --> 00:52:27,341
- Really?
- [in English] Yes, I promise.

642
00:52:28,944 --> 00:52:30,971
- [in Chinese] You better not be lying to me.
- [in English] I promise.

643
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:35,881
[sighs]

644
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:39,155
[in English] My family can help
you get out of the country...

645
00:52:40,681 --> 00:52:41,850
if that's what you want.

646
00:52:43,457 --> 00:52:45,353
- [in English] Really?
- I can help you.

647
00:52:45,421 --> 00:52:47,363
- [in Chinese] I can help get you out.
- [in English] Oh, my God,

648
00:52:47,431 --> 00:52:50,122
you have no idea what that means to me.
Thank you.

649
00:52:55,266 --> 00:52:56,304
[in English] Go.

650
00:53:08,045 --> 00:53:09,845
[in English] If I make it,
you can come visit me.

651
00:53:12,352 --> 00:53:13,849
[in English] My place is here.

652
00:53:17,124 --> 00:53:18,887
I'll miss you, you know?

653
00:53:20,888 --> 00:53:22,858
Yeah, I'm gonna miss you too.

654
00:53:26,799 --> 00:53:29,029
- Maybe if I...
- Stay away, you cannot help.

655
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:33,099

00:56:32,921 --> 00:56:35,082
- [in English] Oh, shit!
- What did you do, Mr. Bryan?!

683
00:56:35,151 --> 00:56:36,750
I don't know,
I didn't do anything!

684
00:56:36,819 --> 00:56:38,290
You mean you're innocent?!

685
00:56:38,359 --> 00:56:39,987
Yes! Yes, I'm innocent!

686
00:56:40,056 --> 00:56:41,995
You need to get out of here,
okay?

687
00:56:42,063 --> 00:56:43,091
Right now!

688
00:56:47,897 --> 00:56:49,597
- You need help.
- Yes!

689
00:56:49,666 --> 00:56:52,632
Uh, um... [exhales]

690
00:56:52,701 --> 00:56:55,167
Uh, okay. Okay,
but you have to do everything that I say,

691
00:56:55,236 --> 00:56:57,303
- exactly what I say. Okay?
- Okay!

692
00:57:09,286 --> 00:57:11,685
[Coco in Chinese] He is here!
Everyone come look!

693
00:57:12,121 --> 00:57:14,219
He sent me an email!
Quick, come look!

694
00:57:14,554 --> 00:57:16,322
The foreigner just sent me
an email, come look!

695
00:57:20,402 --> 00:57:22,394
That foreigner sent me an email!

696
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:28,972
[in Chinese]
He's heading for the stairs!

697
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,146

[Bryan in Chinese] Thank you!

710
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:51,448
- [in Chinese] Did you spot him?
- [in Chinese] No, no sight of him.

711
00:59:51,717 --> 00:59:54,788
All units head back to the other
entrances, he must have doubled back!

01:00:42,001 --> 01:00:43,264

I am American owner!

715
01:00:43,333 --> 01:00:45,531
- Okay, show me ID if you can!
- Fuck me!

716
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:52,771
Oh.

717
01:00:53,508 --> 01:00:55,816
Oh. Oh! Got it.
Okay, got it. Okay.

718
01:01:07,258 --> 01:01:08,422
[in Chinese]
What the hell is all this?

719
01:01:09,592 --> 01:01:11,192
[in English] I thought this
company was bankrupt,

720
01:01:11,261 --> 01:01:12,795
what are all these boxes
doing here?

721
01:01:13,464 --> 01:01:14,997
[man in Chinese] This stuff has
been here for years.

722
01:01:15,366 --> 01:01:16,770
[in English] Somebody should
be fired for that,

723
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,439
it's probably some asshole
in Shanghai.

724
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:19,633
[in Chinese] This way, boss.

725
01:01:20,002 --> 01:01:21,039
[in Chinese] I knew that.

726
01:01:23,773 --> 01:01:25,814
[in Chinese] Are the relocation
records in this office?

727
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:28,649
Boss, this is just an
administrator's office.

728
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:31,247
The other records
are in other files.

729
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:33,887
- Go get them!
- Okay.

730
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,838
[in Chinese] Hello.

731
01:02:02,083 --> 01:02:03,651
- [in Chinese] Hello.
- [in Chinese] Yes, hello.

732
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:07,020
Yeah.
My name is Detective Cheng.

733
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:10,220
You called us about
a foreigner, is this him?

734
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:12,057
You can see here.

735
01:02:15,158 --> 01:02:16,995
Yes! That's him!
That's him!

736
01:02:17,064 --> 01:02:18,996
- You're sure he's the one?
- I'm sure.

737
01:02:19,065 --> 01:02:20,797
When was the last time
you saw him?

738
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:23,596
Tonight! He took my daughter
out somewhere!

739
01:02:23,664 --> 01:02:25,268
My daughter stupidly
fell for his tricks!

740
01:02:26,036 --> 01:02:28,810
- Oh.
- [phone rings]

741
01:02:32,511 --> 01:02:33,545
Yes?

742
01:02:34,181 --> 01:02:35,212
[Bryan speaking Chinese
over phone] <i>Hello!</i>

743
01:02:36,048 --> 01:02:37,780
It's him!
Detective, it's him!

744
01:02:38,249 --> 01:02:40,716
- Yes? Hello.
- Ni hao, Detective.

745
01:02:40,784 --> 01:02:42,649
[in English] What are you
doing, calling me like this?

746
01:02:43,218 --> 01:02:46,927
[in English] I'm not the person that
you're looking for, but you know that.

747
01:02:48,193 --> 01:02:50,558
Who should I be after,
Mr. Bryan?

748
01:02:51,728 --> 01:02:54,803
Come to the factory on Bei
Yuan Road by the river,

749
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:56,596
I'll tell you there.

750
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:06,276
[in English]
Go search this address.

751
01:03:07,077 --> 01:03:08,113
<i>Find out why he's there.</i>

752
01:03:09,613 --> 01:03:11,518
[in Chinese] Wait Wait! Wait!
You can't come in,

753
01:03:11,586 --> 01:03:12,815
this is private property!

754
01:03:13,551 --> 01:03:15,420
- [in Chinese] I'm a detective.
- Okay, what do you want?

755
01:03:15,489 --> 01:03:16,890
Have you seen anybody strange
come through here recently?

756
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:19,391
Oh. There was this guy,
a foreigner boss

757
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:22,327
who came through,
but he had paperwork and permission.

758
01:03:22,396 --> 01:03:24,998
- Where did he go?
- He should be coming back any second.

759
01:03:27,295 --> 01:03:28,760
I think somebody's coming.

760
01:03:35,635 --> 01:03:37,703
- Stop!
- I didn't do anything!

761
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:47,053
- This is where you left him?
- Yes, sir.

[Cheng in Chinese] <i>Yes? Yes?
Hello?</i>

769
01:05:09,832 --> 01:05:13,801
[in English] Mr. Zellerman,
fancy meeting you here.

770
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:16,945
[in Chinese]
I didn't want to meet like this.

771
01:05:19,174 --> 01:05:22,808
[in Chinese] Why do you make it
sound so dramatic, foreigner?

772
01:05:30,054 --> 01:05:31,291
How did you get these?

773
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:34,930
What about the other stand-ins?
The last CFO?

774
01:05:38,193 --> 01:05:39,231
You killed him?

775
01:05:39,898 --> 01:05:40,936
Your partner?

776
01:05:42,931 --> 01:05:45,367
[in English] Actually I killed
that fucking cunt.

777
01:05:45,435 --> 01:05:46,873
I've been waiting for you.
Come on!

778
01:05:46,942 --> 01:05:48,504
[in Chinese] To the roof!
Quietly.

779
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:00,588
[in English] You must've gone to
a lot of trouble to get these.

780
01:06:01,391 --> 01:06:03,486
[in English] It was less
trouble than it should've been.

781
01:06:04,952 --> 01:06:06,786
How have you been pulling
this off for so long?

782
01:06:07,122 --> 01:06:10,097
As you said, it was less
trouble than it should've been.

783
01:06:10,767 --> 01:06:11,791
This laowai's quite clever!

784
01:06:12,998 --> 01:06:14,029
Give me his phone.

785
01:06:14,832 --> 01:06:17,605
You know, as surprised as I
am that you're still alive,

786
01:06:17,674 --> 01:06:19,469
I was even more shocked...

787
01:06:20,575 --> 01:06:21,603
Fucking-A.

788
01:06:25,741 --> 01:06:27,444
Who the fuck have you been
speaking to?

789
01:06:27,513 --> 01:06:29,946
- Who the fuck are you?!
- Who the fuck am I?!

790
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:32,076
- [thuds]
- [grunts]

791
01:06:32,145 --> 01:06:34,384
Don't think you're getting away
with this shit,

792
01:06:34,453 --> 01:06:36,222
it's not how it
fucking works, mate.

793
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:37,724
Kill him!

794
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:41,493
He doesn't like the nasty bits,
still a bit squeamish.

795
01:06:41,862 --> 01:06:43,058
Just me and you now.

796
01:06:43,694 --> 01:06:45,660
I should've put an end to you
a long time ago.

797
01:06:46,967 --> 01:06:48,696
Then why am I still alive?

798
01:06:51,772 --> 01:06:52,767
Good question!

799
01:06:53,970 --> 01:06:55,375
- [in Chinese] Police! He's got a gun!
- [gunfire]

01:06:55,444 --> 01:06:56,539
[grunts]

801
01:07:03,984 --> 01:07:05,020
[in Chinese] He's gone.

802
01:07:07,455 --> 01:07:09,684
- [in English] You got my call?
- [in English] Yes.

803
01:07:10,354 --> 01:07:11,653
Are you gonna uncuff me now?

804
01:07:13,528 --> 01:07:14,557
No.

805
01:07:36,081 --> 01:07:37,349
[in English] Where am I?

806
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:43,058
[in English]
You are charged with fraud

807
01:07:44,025 --> 01:07:45,654
and grand theft from the people.

808
01:07:46,724 --> 01:07:50,758
If you had no business with it,
why did you run?

809
01:07:55,498 --> 01:07:57,732
You don't even know who I am.

810
01:08:00,108 --> 01:08:02,275
She told us a great deal
about you.

811
01:08:04,905 --> 01:08:06,807
So then why am I
still sitting here?

812
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:10,708
How did you know Wang
before this?

813
01:08:10,777 --> 01:08:12,780
I had never met him before.

814
01:08:14,618 --> 01:08:16,323
- But you seem to think...
- I had no idea

815
01:08:16,392 --> 01:08:18,854
what his plans were
before you tried to arrest me,

816
01:08:18,923 --> 01:08:21,625
and I let him almost kill me
so that you could find him.

817
01:08:21,694 --> 01:08:24,660
Does that sound like somebody
who's guilty to you?

818
01:08:27,532 --> 01:08:29,500
How would you like
to see her again?

819
01:08:36,077 --> 01:08:37,805
We would like you to help us.

820
01:08:40,481 --> 01:08:43,811
In return,
we can offer you a clean slate.

821
01:08:48,551 --> 01:08:50,057
From where I was
standing before,

822
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:53,425
that might have seemed
appealing.

823
01:08:58,596 --> 01:09:00,531
But I'm standing over here
now...

824
01:09:03,899 --> 01:09:06,471
and if I have to stand trial,
I will.

825
01:09:09,310 --> 01:09:12,103
But I am not
going to be leaned on.

826
01:09:19,479 --> 01:09:20,518
Very well.
