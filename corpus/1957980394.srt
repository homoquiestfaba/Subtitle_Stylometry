1
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:35,744
Good day, Stafford.

2
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:36,745
I'm Rick Stockwell,

3
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:40,497
filling in for Samantha Burns, who's
feeling a bit under the weather.

4
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:44,836
Samantha, we're all dying to have you back
with us, and we wish you a speedy recovery.

5
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:48,714
With that, let's head on down
to Gene Porter, who has news

6
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,510
about the alarming increase of
wait time at Stafford Memorial Hospital.

7
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:55,805
Gene, what can you tell us about this
developing situation?

8
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,350
Gene...

9
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:03,771

Uh, Chef, I, I, I, I

42
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,659
I need you to stay late.

43
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,203
Well, now I have a note
from the principal here.

44
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,284
Some kids are going to be staying after,
and you need to give them sustenance.

45
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,167
Do you understand?

46
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:17,715
Thank you for your cooperation. Ahem.

47
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,418
Mm mm mm mm mm.

48
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,183
I didn't order...

49
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,101
They always mess things up. Always.

50
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,478
Oh, good. Glad you're here.
Come here, come here, come here.

51
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,938
I'd like to show you what we're doing here.

52
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,606
Okay., now, first off,
everything is fragile...

53
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,984
Glad you could join us.
Come on in, please.

54
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,319
Please come in. You, too.

55
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,903
Come on. I haven't got a day.

56
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,904
I don't want to be here all evening,
and I want to get this assignment done.

57
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,200
You too, missy. Come on.

58
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:28,911
Get over here.

59
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,038
Pay attention.

60
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,247
Okay, now, this is your assignment.

61
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,915
I want to get this done this evening.

62
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,919
The rat maze, I got several pieces

63
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:54,686
So the fatter one is Ginger.?

64
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,272
Essentially. Yes. I've
nicknamed the more sedentary

65
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,107
one Ginger and the more active one Fred.

66
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,943
You know, smooth moves like Fred Astaire.

67
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,654
I think Ginger might be a dude to you.

68
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,074
Ewe!

69
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,742
Actually, they're both female.

70
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,952
Nice observation skills Bull.

71
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:14,957
Hey, wasn't Ginger Rogers like Fred
Astaire's dance partner or something?

72
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,501
Why is she the sedentary one?

73
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,086
So misogynistic!

74
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,712
We can change the names if you want to.

75
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,089
Whatever.

76
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,216
Listen, Frankie, let's
just not get too caught up in the names.

77
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,498
The important thing is
that we can observe their behavior.

78
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,647
And so we can see how their lifestyle
affects their cognitive ability.

79
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,265
Put your money on the active one, boys.

80
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,936
We all know it's survival of the
fittest. Like Dagwood said.

81
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,146
Darwin!

82
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,774
Whatever freaks, it's a fact.

83
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,568
It's always the strongest
who survive in the end.

84
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,989
Hey, where are there three cages?

85
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,576
Oh, there were actually three rats, but.

86
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,702
Well, you see, Ginger.

87
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:55,206
Well, rat cannibalism is actually very...
Ewe, never mind.

88
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,666
What?

89
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,168
Dude, she the rat.

90
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,379
Who?

91
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,879
Frankie?!?

92
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,756
NOOOOOOO

93
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,800
No, Ginger did.

94
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,010
Oh, whatever.

95
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,347
I don't know I was signing
up to babysit rats.

96
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,766
Actually, Alexis I specifically chose this

97
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,995
because I thought it would be pretty easy
for us to get this done tonig...

98
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,855
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

99
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,357
Are you saying
that this was all your idea?

100
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:22,442
Well, yeah, but...

101
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:24,109
This whole... the rats...

102
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:24,861
Well, no...

103
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,736
Us! On a Friday!

104
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,947
Okay, Not tonight, but listen...

105
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,700
Come on, man!

106
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,075
Not tonight. That's not what I meant.

107
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:35,830
This is so lame.

108
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,414
I can't believe it.

109
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:40,585
But I actually agree
with little Miss Pompoms.

110
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,356
Listen, guys, it's really not that bad,
and it won't take that long.

111
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,924
Besides, we know I'll be doing
most of the work anyways.

112
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,927
Now, if we can just get this done,
you all can go back to living

113
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:54,515
your very important lives.

114
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,309
And how are we doing...

115
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,852
my students?

116
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,272
I see you've made some progress.

117
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:02,315
Tell me.

118
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:03,732
Have you made any preliminary

119
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,193
observations and hypotheses?

120
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:09,572
There is a general consensus between us
that the more active of the two rats

121
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,142
will have at least a slight advantage
in cognitive testing.

122
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,952
Yeah, what he said and

123
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,206
I have observed that the more active rats

124
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,875
eat more like, you know, other rats.

125
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,544
You can't fool me, students.

126
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,881
You need to focus on your work.

127
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:31,009
Now, you knew when you took up my class
that the labs would require

128
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,385
time to put in.

129
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:35,181
And you waited to the last minute
And here you are.

130
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:38,016
And now it's on you.

131
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,476
Now, no one.

132
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:43,356
No one is leaving here tonight
till I see preliminary results.

133
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:45,566
Okay.

134
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,566
Yeah.

135
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,862
We better be done with this by,
like, eight,

136
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:53,741
because I have a date tonight with Mason.

137
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,992
Yeah, he's picking you up here.

138
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,577
So whatever.

139
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:00,664
Okay, we just better be done soon.

140
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,415
Let me be perfectly clear.

141
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,961
No one leaves tonight until I see results.

142
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,420
Understand?

143
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,424
So no visitors tonight?

144
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,092
What?

145
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:16,055
What you children
are going to be the death of me.

146
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,724
No more distractions,

147
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,852
no more phones, hand 'em in.

148
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:24,896
You're killing me Smalls!

149
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:25,731
Yours too.

150
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,149
Seriously? Yes, ma'am.

151
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,818
I don't want to be here all evening.

152
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,945
And you all need to focus.

153
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,448
Weird flex. But, okay.

154
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,449
Wow, thanks.

155
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,868
That was smooth.

156
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,786
Whatever.

157
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:44,750
Okay, let's just let these disgusting
things run around so I can go out tonight.

158
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,835
I know you might not understand,

159
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,422
because it's not like
you have anything else to do, Frankie.

160
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,132
Ouch, chill.

161
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:55,845
Just because I'm not a cookie cutter
Barbie doesn't mean I don't have a life.

162
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,764
A life?

163
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,474
What would you know about a life?

164
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:06,147
You think black... is the new... black?

165
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,065
Hey, Alexis, how about you grab Ginger?

166
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,944
It's about time we get a trial run

167
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,863
The carnival one!?!

168
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,364
Cannibal!

169
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:19,368
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

170
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,620
She looks hungry.

171
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,372
I hope you don't bite me

172
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,665
now like she can eat you.

173
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,336
Yeah, but it can still bite, right?

174
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,005
A little rat nip? That ain't nothing.

175
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,422
My brother Dexter.

176
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,841
Now he's a fricking biter.

177
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:38,511
We were fighting in the morning,
and he really got me good.

178
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,472
Check it out.

179
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,890
Ahem... Thank you all

180
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,560
for your stimulating discussion
and hard work.

181
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,647
And you, can you at least
try to help out a little?

182
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:50,008
We need to see how long it takes
Ginger to get to her food.

183
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,478
Dude,

184
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:33,192
my stomach. I think...

185
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,903
I think I'm getting hungry.

186
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,700
Man, I wonder what
they're making for dinner.

187
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,919
So, like, how many more
of these rat maze things

188
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,716
do we have to do before we can just, like,
name a winner and get out of here?

189
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,300
Well, unfortunately, there

190
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,981
hasn't been a statistical difference
between the two conditions yet.

191
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,804
A statitica what?

192
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,889
Simply put, we need to do more trials.

193
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,850
And besides, we're out of food.

194
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,229
So why don't you guys just take
another five, and I'll go get more pellets

195
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,111
And just where do you think you are
scurrying off to?

196
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,195
Oh, well,
I was running to get more rat food

197
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,488
so we can do some more trials.

198
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,783
Wait, where's that odd looking girl?

199
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,493
Uh, Francine.
She really prefers to be called Frankie.

200
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,536
And, I don't know, Sir.

201
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,121
Perhaps the bathroom. I mean...

202
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,622
Speak of the she devil!

203
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,710
I can't have you running
around the school at night.

204
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:36,297
Now you need to tell me if you ever need
to leave the lab for whatever reason.

205
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,091
Like to go get a pizza?

206
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,552
No sir, absolutely not.

207
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,179
Until you're done,
I'm responsible for you.

208
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,598
And as such,
no one is to leave this school

209
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,268
for whatever reason.
As for your sustenance.

210
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,396
I've asked the cook to remain behind,
to prepare your dinner,

211
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,483
which should be ready sometime soon.

212
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:59,612
So I must ask you to stay on task.

213
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:05,034
Only a proper lab report which characterizes
the experiment will be accepted!

214
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,832
Ugh. What a douche.

215
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,460
So anyway, about the cook.

216
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,087
I went to the kitchen to see
what was for dinner.

217
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,713
You're welcome Bull.

218
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:22,176
And the cook was just standing
in the middle of the room,

219
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:25,763
staring at the wall... like a statue.

220
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,807
Really freaky.

221
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,059
Nothing's cooking.

222
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,395
So then I ask him, what's for dinner?

223
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,480
And he just shushes me.

224
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,566
And gives me this really chilling look.

225
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,443
Soul piercing, really.

226
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,571
You are so dramatic.

227
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:43,989
Whatever.

228
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,156
It was weird.

229
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,409
Like serial killer weird.

230
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,203
I just thought it was best

231
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:52,540
to get out of there
before he decided to put me on the menu.

232
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,876
I think Bull has the right idea.
Order takeout.

233
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,211
Pizza.

234
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:01,214
Pizza. Pizza.

235
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,757
Another fascinating story, really.

236
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,717
But, guys,
we just need to get back to work here.

237
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:05,261
And besides, I'm

238
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:09,139
sure there's a logical explanation
for as to why all of this is going on.

239
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:13,185
Just adults can be odd sometimes, right?

240
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:15,396
Anyways...

241
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:16,688
We need to do more trials.

242
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,066
I'll go get more rat pellets.

243
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,829
Shhh. Stop your screaming boy.

244
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,915
Those damn rats!

245
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:17,708
They're everywhere.

246
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,208
You see where it went?

247
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,711
Uhhhhh... uhhhhh

248
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,798
Oh, you're one of those rat kids.

249
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,008
What are you doing in here?

250
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,635
Kitchen's closed!

251
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,969
Can't you see I'm busy?

252
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,387
I am. I just... I heard. I just.

253
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,765
I was just wondering what time dinner is?

254
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,601
Dinner will be ready when I say it's ready!

255
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,394
Now go back to playing with

256
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:39,521
your little rat friends.

257
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,869
Oh, hey, Oz.

258
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,412
We're getting better numbers from Fred.

259
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,164
I think you would say
we're starting to see

260
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,874
a statistical difference.

261
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,710
So, I see you brought the rat food.

262
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,045
But man...

263
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,212
when do we get to eat?

264
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,453
Funny you should say that. Bull

265
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,215
I actually bumped into the cook.

266
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,635
And Frankie's right.
He's clinically insane.

267
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,429
And besides,
I saw what he's making for dinner,

268
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,389
but I'm not so sure
we're going to want to eat.

269
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,685
Yeah, well,
it better not be loaded with carbs.

270
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,813
One of us has got to watch her figure.

271
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,898
Listen, I'm not so sure
about the carbohydrate content.

272
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,900
I'm not even sure
if it's fit for human consumption.

273
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,945
Oh, come on, Oz. It can't be that bad.

274
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,364
At least you didn't try to kill you.

275
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:32,949
All I'm saying is that what

276
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,161
I saw in there would make this stuff
look tasty.

277
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,080
Let's just look at it.

278
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:41,416
Okay, so show me what's going on here.

279
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,668
You saw different numbers, but

280
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,172
we didn't have any different numbers,
clearly.

281
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,298
Yeah, sorry.

282
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:52,135
I wrote their behaviors, their numbers,
like it's all right here

283
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,345
under the...

284
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,264
Excuse me. Ahem.

285
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,599
Is this on?

286
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,645
Students, please proceed in an
orderly fashion to lab B and enjoy

287
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:05,983
your freshly prepared sustenance.

288
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,985
Thank you.

289
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:27,880
Dude.

290
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,797
Are you sure you don't want to finish that?

291
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,384
Because I could totally eat it.

292
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,598
Ugh, you are such a pig.

293
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,308
Seriously, dude, that's disgusting.

294
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,934
The food is so gross.

295
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,188
It's probably left over from the eighties.

296
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,944
I was thinking.

297
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,197
I mean, look at us.

298
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:58,869
I think maybe Professor Romero
is doing an experiment on us,

299
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,998
you know,
trying to see if we'll eat this stuff.

300
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,749
Who knows what's in it.

301
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,210
Just look at this food.

302
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:11,256
This room.
Our rats trapped in a maze project.

303
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,842
I think maybe... Sure Frankie.

304
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,596
Conspiracies much?

305
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,222
No, I'm serious.

306
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,308
Of course you are.

307
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,645
If you ever noticed how he kind of just

308
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,981
lurks around and watches us,

309
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:32,653
I think maybe, just maybe, we're

310
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,197
he's rats... in here.

311
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,865
Come on, man.

312
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,911
Like I said, I don't think this stuff
is suitable for human consumption.

313
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,580
Huh. Well, if that's the case, Bull's safe.

314
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,583
Even though I think he's had enough

315
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,380
Anyways, we should probably get going
so we can finish our experiment

316
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,217
and just get out of here
and get some real food.

317
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,306
O. M. G. Bull!

318
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,811
That so noxious Oh, I.

319
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,647
I don't think I should be eaten that much.

320
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,440
I think I overdid it.

321
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,360
No, dip Sherlock.

322
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,237
We should really go.

323
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,553
Damn dude! Again?!

324
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,140
I don't feel so good.

325
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,976
I got to go take a dump. Huh?

326
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,691
How could he be so stupid?

327
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:57,988
I got to admit, I'm not a picky eater,
but that stuff was not food.

328
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,780
Speaking of eating,

329
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:03,869
did you guys realize that Ginger isn't
eating that much anymore?

330
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,283
Even after she goes through the maze,
she still isn't even touching her treat.

331
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,333
Do you think maybe
she had too much to eat?

332
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,494
I don't realize you're paying
that much attention, but,

333
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,464
yeah, I've noticed Ginger's behavior
in our logs

334
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,468
and it's difficult to tell whether
she's not eating because she's not hungry

335
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,095
or if something else is causing her
lack of appetite.

336
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:26,516
Yeah, I think both noxious fumes
are contributing to my lack of appetite.

337
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,769
Where is the fat boy?

338
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,439
Why can you not just all stay together?

339
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,150
Oh, uh, Bull, he wasn't feeling well,
so he went to the restroom.

340
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,110
I think he might have indigestion.

341
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,071
You tell Mr.

342
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:42,199
Bull I want to see him when he returns.

343
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,451
I will be waiting in my office.

344
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,745
Yes, Professor.

345
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,878
Come on, you guys.

346
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,047
You gotta admit.

347
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,175
Professor Romero is a bit strange.

348
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,676
I think he pays more attention.

349
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,388
To our behavior than the experiment.

350
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:07,391
I hate to agree with anything
that vampire says,

351
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:13,313
but the professor is a bit... odd.?

352
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,577
Whoa, what, the...

353
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,706
Oh, what happened?

354
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:33,249
Uh, the lights went out. Duh.

355
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,458
Nice one, Frankie.

356
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,420
Alexis, look, I'm sure it's just...

357
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,089
Students, I need to go to the basement work
room immediately!

358
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,133
Grab everything and go now.
GO!

359
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,071
Frankie, the professor needs us to get
down there, so can you please just help?

360
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,387
I am helping, Oz!

361
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,681
Can we just go, please?

362
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,226
Oh, Mason. I'm not ready to die yet.

363
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,770
I'm not ready to kill you... yet.

364
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,647
I can't see anything. Oh, my God.

365
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,608
I can't see anything.
Mason!

366
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,193
I wish I was with Mason!

367
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,571
This step.

368
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,447
Oh, thank God.

369
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,158
Can you quit going on and on now?

370
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,534
Guys, enough.

371
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:11,830
Can we just get down to the workroom?
My arms are about to fall off.

372
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,832
Why is it so dark and like...

373
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,625
Oh, my Gosh. Just chill!

374
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:19,421
Watch the corner.

375
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,464
Mason.

376
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,596
All right, this is good.

377
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,766
Let's just set our stuff up down here.

378
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,475
What?

379
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:36,103
We're really going
to keep doing this stuff

380
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,229
down here?

381
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,900
Don't you think something crazy
is happening out there?

382
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:44,820
Do you really think that Professor Strange
is worried about us

383
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:45,988
finishing this project?

384
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:48,157
I don't know. I don't know.
I just don't know.

385
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,868
All I know is it Professor
Romero needs us to finish our project.

386
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,869
Okay.

387
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,583
Don't you mean your project?

388
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,128
This whole rat maze
thing was all your idea.

389
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,965
And if you ask me,
you are just as weird as he is, Oz.

390
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,926
I'm so done with this sh...

391
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,846
Hey, Alexis, you signed up for this
class, too, and it requires lab work.

392
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,159
Okay, so I'm sorry if that makes you late
for your stupid date or whatever,

393
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,620
but it's not my fault that the power
went out and we're stuck down here.

394
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,895
So can you please just help
get Ginger ready for her next run?

395
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,981
Okay. Now Frankie.

396
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,691
So I see...

397
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,576
That was upstairs.

398
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,619
Hey, guys.

399
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,205
What do you want me to do with...?

400
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:41,294
I guess it's just you and me now.

401
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:48,134
Oh, you dirty.

402
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,679
Where are you?

403
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:52,930
Don't you... Ugh!

404
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:56,893
When I find you, I'm going
to personally feed you to the other rat!

405
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,444
Kitchen

406
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,077
Hello?

407
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,372
Yeah, this place is getting
creepy by the minute.

408
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,503
Hey, Oz, check this out.

409
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:27,674
Do you think this is blood?

410
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,343
Hard to tell.

411
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:34,890
Maybe the chef cut himself
or cut one of those rats he was chasing.

412
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,602
There are rats running around in here.

413
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,061
I mean, I don't know.

414
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,270
That's what the chef said.

415
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,899
Though his objective
awareness is questionable.

416
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,776
At any rate,
I'm sufficiently creeped out by now.

417
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,032
Should probably get back to the basement,
wrap it up and get out of here.

418
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,573
Yeah, I'm with you.

419
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:55,993
Rats, blood, crazy cooks.

420
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,913
Oh, my!

421
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,554
Alexis, you'll never
believe what we just...

422
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,681
Oh, my God. What happened to your finger?

423
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:18,849
Where's Bull?

424
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,268
He come back yet?

425
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:24,605
Hmmm, uh, that...

426
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,315
I don't know. No.

427
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:26,650
Hey, that rat Ginger...

428
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,776
bit my finger.

429
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:34,031
And, well, she ran off somewhere.

430
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,492
Oh, no.

431
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,661
She's got to be around here somewhere.

432
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:42,249
I keep listening,
trying to hear her scratching or whatever.

433
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,978
Well, we have to find that rat before
Professor Romero finds out

434
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:48,045
or this whole night will
have been for nothing.

435
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,171
Oh, no, no.

436
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,258
I'm not doing this
crap with you guys again.

437
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,342
No offense.

438
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:56,596
We're just going to have to find Ginger

439
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,853
What's going on in here, huh?

440
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,816
I keep hearing rustling out there.

441
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,442
Wait a second.

442
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:11,485
Have you all been wondering about.

443
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:14,197
I brought you down here for a reason.

444
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:20,287
Where is that Bull?

445
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:24,332
I swear I heard him
sulking around upstairs.

446
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:28,544
So, professor, we actually just finished
the observation phase of our experiment,

447
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:32,591
and we just need to collect the data
and write a report... why, what's going on.

448
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,635
Oh, yes.

449
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:37,846
That...

450
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,390
nothing to worry about children.

451
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:45,144
There was a vehicular accident outside.

452
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:49,274
A power poll hit
the car and caught on fire.

453
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:53,695
I thought it would be more prudent
and safe if you were down here

454
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,237
away from the windows.

455
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,739
You know, for safety purposes.

456
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,282
But you're safe there. All is well.

457
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,992
You may resume.

458
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,245
I'm still unhappy about Bull.

459
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,872
Send him to me when you see him.

460
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,540
And hurry this up. Wrap it up.

461
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:09,126
I don't know how long
the generator will last.

462
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:12,213
And I don't want to be around
when the backup power runs out of juice.

463
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:14,341
Yes. Yes, of course Professor.

464
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,969
We've got to find Ginger.

465
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:19,512
Sure.

466
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:20,929
But I don't know if I believe

467
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,098
what the professor was saying
about what's going on.

468
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,226
Guys, my finger... Shhh!

469
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:29,230
Do you?

470
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,565
Do you hear that?

471
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,902
No. Hear what?...
Shhh!

472
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,111
Listen.

473
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,530
I caught the end of it,
and it can't be good.

474
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,741
Maybe it's just Bull, you know?

475
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,118
Frankie, we should probably
go check up on him.

476
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,747
You stay here and look for Ginger.

477
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,595
This isn't good.

478
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,640
I can't believe he bit me!

479
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:07,227
What the hell's wrong with him?...
Did he just say someone bit him?

480
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,191
Don't they have any respect?
God!

481
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,454
I think that's Ginger.

482
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,872
You see what's up with Bull?

483
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,251
I'm going to go get the rat.

484
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:12,167
Oh, don't pee, don't pee,
don't pee, don't pee...

485
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:16,629
Alexis, there is some weird
stuff going down... out.

486
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,841
Alexis.

487
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,844
I'm going to kill her.

488
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:38,859
Professor Romero.

489
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,152
Is that you?

490
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,113
Are you okay in there?

491
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,287
Professor...

492
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,247
Oh, man.

493
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:53,248
What the...?

494
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,542
This is not happening.

495
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,086
I'm out of here.

496
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,679
Oh, my God.

497
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,682
He did not!

498
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,194
Alexis!

499
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:22,195
He bit me!

500
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:25,406
Who bit you, Ginger?

501
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,326
I know, oh, my gosh.

502
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,327
Okay, look...

503
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,507
Oh my god!

504
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,513
Oh my god!

505
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:53,058
Okay, okay, I'm, I'm gonna
go get you some help...

506
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:53,810
Okay.

507
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:55,519
Just... stay there.

508
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,230
Don't... Don't move.

509
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,300
What... What the...

510
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:25,800
It's me.

511
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:26,842
It's Oz. It's me.

512
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:27,843
It's me. It's me.

513
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,220
Sh.

514
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,762
What the H?

515
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:32,598
Alexis is hurt bad.

516
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,724
Sh...

517
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,642
I think. I think I saw Bull, but he

518
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,978
he had turned into some sort of a
I don't know,

519
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:38,979
a zombie!

520
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,150
This is impossible

521
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:46,237
from what I've seen and smelled tonight.

522
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,071
I certainly think it is.

523
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,407
How could this happen?

524
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:54,412
Do you think this is all part of
the professor's twisted experiment on us?

525
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,581
I mean, do you think he had the cook do it?

526
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,708
Maybe it was in that awful food.

527
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,335
That stuff was really nasty.

528
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,253
And Bull was the only one who ate it.

529
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,379
Yeah, perhaps.

530
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,759
But Professor Romero was mumbling
something about how someone bit him.

531
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,428
Maybe that was Bull. He did seem sick.

532
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,640
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my God. You're right.

533
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,684
Karma's a bitch.

534
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,102
Oh, and Professor Ratzo,

535
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:23,524
he was in his office moaning,
you know, like a zombie.

536
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,610
Maybe it was him or Bull
who bit Alexis.

537
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:30,281
Took a big chunk right out of her face.

538
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:31,574
Oh, my God.

539
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:34,159
I don't think she's going to make it.

540
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,619
We got to get out of here.

541
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,414
There's the Professor and Alexis, too.

542
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:39,998
I don't understand.

543
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,167
I'm sorry, Oz.

544
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,336
I'm sorry.

545
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:48,007
Maybe it wasn't the professor or the food.

546
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,051
You know, Alexis was bit.

547
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,886
Maybe it has something to do with that.

548
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:56,307
And Bull, he was saying that his
little brother beat him this morning, too.

549
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:57,642
It just.

550
00:32:57,643 --> 00:33:00,853
It just doesn't make any sense. I just.

551
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,689
Regardless, we've got to get out of here
before the zombies

552
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,985
or whatever it is to
trys to snack on us, too.

553
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,528
Let's just go.

554
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:09,821
Yeah. Oh. Wait?

555
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:10,822
What about the cook?

556
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,197
Oh...

557
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:11,948
Shouldn't we like...

558
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:14,149
Well, the thing is,
I don't think he's going to make it.

559
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,954
When I walked in on Bull, he was munching
on what looked like the cook's arm.

560
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,665
Yeah, I think we're on our own here.

561
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,458
We should just get out of here.

562
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,252
Wait.

563
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:29,132
I don't know if you've noticed,
but brilliant professor zombified

564
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,217
really did chain all the doors shut

565
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:33,802
Frick!

566
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,972
Maybe we could go to his office
and get his keys.

567
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,473
Yeah.

568
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:39,850
You have fun with that.

569
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,435
That's easier said than done.

570
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:45,814
Last I knew, Bitey McBitey Face
was locked in his office,

571
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,860
and I ain't going back to check

572
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,571
There's got to be another way out

573
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,989
How about the lower loading docks?

574
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,074
We've loaded tons of sets
through there before.

575
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,326
Well, I mean, wouldn't that be locked, too?

576
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,580
Yeah, but being a theater
kid has its perks.

577
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:05,543
We keep a spare set of keys backstage, you
know, for all the after hours load outs.

578
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:07,879
Oh, my God.

579
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,505
I think I love you!

580
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:14,427
You know, in, like, a totally congenial,
sort of, kind of way.

581
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,888
Um, so, anyways, we should get going.

582
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:18,889
Uh huh.

583
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,631
You stay here here and get the keys.

584
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,575
I'll go distract Bull
then meet you at the dock.

585
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:37,992
Hey, Bull,

586
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:38,951
you big lummox

587
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:39,951
come munch on me.

588
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,412
Come on. Over here.

589
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,413
Come get me.

590
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:46,875
Come on.

591
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:50,879
Come on.

592
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,162
No!

593
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,584
Oh, my God.

594
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:19,510
Oh, my God.

595
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:22,054
Oz, thank you.
I thought I was a goner.

596
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,766
I'm starting to realize

597
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:30,104
that killing zombies
isn't as easy as it seems in movies.

598
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,856
Luckily, they're super clumsy.

599
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:33,524
Hey.

600
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:34,858
Are you okay?

601
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,859
Yeah.

602
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,528
Let's just get out of here.

603
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:42,950
That's..

604
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:44,409
For being such a douche.

605
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,953
Professor.

606
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,331
And that's..

607
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:50,499
For trying to take a bite out of me.

608
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,877
Okay, I'm good now.

609
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:54,878
Let's go.

610
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:12,062
Bull's right about one thing.

611
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,730
Survival does favor the fittest.

612
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,900
And I, for one, need to work on my cardio.

613
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:18,736
Come on!

614
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,491
Dude this is so not my day!

615
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,408
I know this is kinda obvious, but

616
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,701
could you go any faster?

617
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,537
Like I didn't think of that already!

618
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,374
Whoa!

619
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,334
Retained digital grasp strength!

620
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,503
Fascinating.

621
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:36,879
Whoa.

622
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,053
Bull!

623
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,018
I don't know how much
longer I can hold this!

624
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,188
I'm going as fast as I can!

625
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,108
Uh, Oz!

626
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,443
Let's Go!

627
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:06,867
Hey, hey, hey Officer! We need help!

628
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,118
Oh, my God.

629
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,120
They're everywhere.

630
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,581
This is the freaking end!

631
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,623
No! Don't say that.

632
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,500
