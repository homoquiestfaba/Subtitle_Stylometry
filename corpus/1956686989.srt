Throw down your weaponsand come with your hands up.

Yeah.

It's always hotter
up in the city.

56

Yeah, yeah.

75
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:42,331
That's me.

76
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,509
So what's your
line, Mr. Reyes?

77
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,992
Swamp coolers,
domestic use only.

78
00:07:51,122 --> 00:07:52,820
Otherwise I'd sell you one.

79
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,690
See you later, Red.

80
00:07:58,303 --> 00:08:01,481
Like I always say,
there's hot people

81
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:04,353
out there who don't even knowtheir savior has come to town.

82
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,267
Thank you, Jake.

83
00:08:14,232 --> 00:08:17,714
Man, could you take
a long time working

84
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:20,500
your way through that or what?

85
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,457
MAN: Jake.

86
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:23,328
Ask her husband.

87
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:26,288
Whoa, thanks for the warning.

88
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:27,202
No, no.

89
00:08:27,332 --> 00:08:28,464
She's fine.

90
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:29,378
She's doing just great.

91
00:08:33,991 --> 00:08:35,645
I'll tell her you said hi.

92
00:08:35,776 --> 00:08:38,518
OK, yeah, my love to yours, too.

93
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:39,431
Bye, bye.

94
00:08:43,348 --> 00:08:46,438
Jake, you've been with us what?

95
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:47,744
Two years now?

96
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,137
Close enough.

97
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:50,921
You know, Jake,
I believe there's

98
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:54,055
something you can do for me, alittle something on the side.

99
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:56,927
Of course, you'll be wellcompensated for your efforts.

100
00:08:57,058 --> 00:08:58,538
There's really no delicateway of putting this.

101
00:08:58,668 --> 00:08:59,843
So I'm just going to
lay it on the table.

102
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:06,676
I believe someone
is fucking my wife,

103
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:07,851
and I'd like to know who it is.

104
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,378
Of course sooner or later,I'm going to catch them at it.

105
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:16,947
Then I'm going to
have to kill them.

106
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:19,210
I can't help but think, if therewas just some way I could find

107
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:22,300
out who it was first,
I could handle it

108
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,476
in a more civilized way.

109
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:25,390
You know what I mean?

110
00:09:29,177 --> 00:09:34,399
And what I need to know here,Jake, is are we negotiating

111
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,881
or am I spanking my own monkey?

112
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:40,841

114
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:10,871
That was way better thanspanking my own monkey.

115
00:10:11,001 --> 00:10:12,481
Oh, you.

116
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,919
[kissing]

117
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,791
What'd you say to him toget him out of his tree?

118
00:10:21,098 --> 00:10:27,583
I said I need Jake Barnes ata little motel across the border

119
00:10:27,714 --> 00:10:29,759
and fuck his brains out.

120
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,980
[laughs]

121
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,156
Honesty is always
the best policy.

122
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:46,254
You know, he'd kill
you if he found out.

123
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:49,213
And then he'd kill you.

124
00:10:49,344 --> 00:10:50,737
Ed would never touch me.

125
00:10:54,131 --> 00:10:57,047
You know, my dear husbandonly gets this jumpy

126
00:10:57,178 --> 00:10:58,092
when there's a drop coming.

127
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:02,966
It's been three months.

128
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:10,452
Here, tie me up.

129
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:11,932
Again?

130
00:11:12,062 --> 00:11:13,150
You know what I mean.

131
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:21,768
You know, if it is a drop,Jake, no more next time.

132
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:23,726
This time we do it.

133
00:11:23,857 --> 00:11:25,423
Let's not get into
that again, all right?

134
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:28,035
Let's just make sure Eddoesn't find out about us.

135
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:30,559
And that's enough for you?

136
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,996
It has been till now.

137
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:33,823

This sure ain't the
best place in the world

153
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,620
today to be hitching a ride.

154
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:16,621
I know.

155
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:19,799

How about the truth?

164
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:50,177
It was my boyfriend.

165
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:55,704
We were on our way to Dallas,and we got in a fight.

166
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,620
He said he knew a short
cut, and we got lost.

167
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:03,625
So he kicked me out of the car.I'm sorry.

168
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:05,018
I just didn't know what to do.

169

OK, OK.
Come on.

170
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:11,502

I can drop you there.

I can't--

What?

178
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:31,827
Do you have a place?

179
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:36,005
May-- maybe I could
stay with you.

I don't have any money.

00:29:19,453 --> 00:29:21,455
Do something wrong?

374
00:29:21,585 --> 00:29:23,500
I don't want anything
from you, Kristin.

375
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:24,501
It's just dinner.

376
00:29:29,724 --> 00:29:30,507
Hungry?

377
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,691
So how was it?

378
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:41,605
Pretty good.

379
00:29:41,736 --> 00:29:43,477
Yes, ma'am.

380
00:29:43,607 --> 00:29:45,392
What?

381
00:29:45,522 --> 00:29:46,697
You sound surprised.

382
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:47,568
I am.

383
00:29:53,182 --> 00:29:55,097
God, they're bright.

384
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:56,751
That's because we're
a mile closer to the sky

385
00:29:56,882 --> 00:30:00,363
than Vegas is.

386
00:30:00,494 --> 00:30:02,757
It makes me dizzy.

387
00:30:02,888 --> 00:30:04,498
I feel like--

388
00:30:04,628 --> 00:30:07,370
I feel like I could justfloat upwards and disappear

389
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:08,719
in a shower of little diamonds.

390
00:30:13,246 --> 00:30:16,510
[thunder]

391
00:30:25,562 --> 00:30:28,043
Monsoon season's starting.

392
00:30:28,174 --> 00:30:31,525
[raining]

393
00:30:33,657 --> 00:30:36,965
[music playing]

394
00:30:48,107 --> 00:30:49,456
- Come on.
- No.

395
00:30:49,586 --> 00:30:50,457
Come out and dance.

396
00:30:50,587 --> 00:30:51,458
Come and dance.

397
00:30:51,588 --> 00:30:52,938
No.

398
00:30:53,068 --> 00:30:55,418
[laughing]

399
00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:56,942
Come on.

400
00:30:57,072 --> 00:30:57,943
Come on.

401
00:30:58,073 --> 00:30:58,813
Come on.

402
00:31:05,037 --> 00:31:06,386
Hey, you're cold.

403
00:31:06,516 --> 00:31:07,387
Let's go inside.

404
00:31:07,517 --> 00:31:08,388
In a minute.

405
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:23,316
[thunder]

406
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:38,244
What are you doing here, Jake?

407
00:31:41,421 --> 00:31:43,249
I'm minding my own business.

408
00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:57,611
I can't figure you out.

409
00:32:01,615 --> 00:32:06,968
You've taken me in withoutexpecting anything in return.

410
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:11,059
I'm getting feed pretty well.

411
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:11,930
You know what I mean.

412
00:32:17,587 --> 00:32:20,460
Yeah, I guess
I'm just an enigma.

413
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:24,333
You like that, don't you?

414
00:32:24,464 --> 00:32:33,908
So should I be insulted thatyou're not coming on to me

415
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:35,518
or flattered?

416
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,917
I guess that's my
[inaudible],, isn't it?

417
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:49,054
Yup.

418
00:32:49,184 --> 00:32:50,490
I guess it is.

419
00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:03,938
You know, a person could
lose himself out here,

420
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:06,723
find some peace.

421
00:33:06,854 --> 00:33:10,205
Not that easy.

422
00:33:10,336 --> 00:33:14,688
I'd settle for a place whereI'm not scared all the time

423
00:33:14,818 --> 00:33:16,733
if I won't have to run anymore.

424
00:33:21,303 --> 00:33:22,261
You run, Kristin?

425
00:33:26,091 --> 00:33:27,353
Just like those
guys in the garage.

426
00:33:36,275 --> 00:33:41,019
So, Mr. Enigma, are you
going to strike it rich,

427
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:44,239
drilling for oil?

428
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,024
Water.

429
00:33:46,154 --> 00:33:47,634
I figure, if I get this up andrunning, I'll be able to tend

430
00:33:47,764 --> 00:33:50,419
myself a real garden.

431
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,508
Sounds like a lot of work.

432
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:56,208
Anyway, I like fixing things.

433
00:33:56,338 --> 00:33:59,820
Yeah, well, some thingsjust aren't worth fixing.

434
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:05,478
Then you've got to be
smart enough to walk way

435
00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:08,785
and not look back.

436
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:12,180
It's easy for you to say.

437
00:34:12,311 --> 00:34:15,618
[footsteps]

438
00:34:23,757 --> 00:34:25,150
Hot?

439
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,500
Yeah.

440
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,327
You OK, Jake?

441
00:34:33,506 --> 00:34:35,943
[door opens]

442
00:34:36,596 --> 00:34:37,292
Jake.

443
00:34:46,997 --> 00:34:49,391
She's going out again tonight.

444
00:34:49,522 --> 00:34:51,393
I'll be there.

445
00:34:51,524 --> 00:34:53,352
You're running out of time.

446
00:34:57,007 --> 00:34:59,314
[closes door]

447
00:35:02,535 --> 00:35:04,798
Be careful, Jake.

448
00:35:04,928 --> 00:35:06,626
Always am.

449
00:35:06,756 --> 00:35:07,670
I'm talking about her.

450
00:35:24,557 --> 00:35:25,384
[gasp]

451
00:35:25,514 --> 00:35:26,211
Nice!

452
00:35:28,952 --> 00:35:30,084
Nothing I haven't before.

453
00:35:35,307 --> 00:35:36,351
Shit, Phil.

454
00:35:36,482 --> 00:35:37,483
What do you think
Barry would say?

455
00:35:37,613 --> 00:35:38,875
Oh, Barry sent me.
Hurry up.

456
00:35:39,006 --> 00:35:40,225
We're going to meet
him in 15 minutes,

457
00:35:40,355 --> 00:35:41,443
and I don't want to
keep him waiting.

458
00:35:45,882 --> 00:35:46,927
You're very nice.

459
00:35:51,627 --> 00:35:52,367
Shit.

460
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:59,331

[footsteps]

463
00:36:12,387 --> 00:36:14,998
Buenos dias, Mr. Montana.

464
00:36:15,129 --> 00:36:17,087
Heat's a bitch, ain't it?

465
00:36:17,218 --> 00:36:18,480
Thanks for being
on time, Phil.

466
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:19,351
Hey, no sweat.

467
00:36:19,481 --> 00:36:20,265
[laughs]

468
00:36:20,395 --> 00:36:21,179
Kristin.

469
00:36:27,663 --> 00:36:29,970
So my dear, how did
things work out?

470
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,494
I think I can hook him.

471
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:35,454
I don't want to
know what you think.

472
00:36:35,584 --> 00:36:37,282
You've had two days.

473
00:36:37,412 --> 00:36:38,413
What the fuck have
you been doing?

474
00:36:38,544 --> 00:36:40,981
Playing house.

475
00:36:41,111 --> 00:36:43,549
I want that bank
guard hooked now.

476
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:49,381
People, this bank is goingto be pregnant for one night

477
00:36:49,511 --> 00:36:50,208
only, OK?

478
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:55,125
$7 million dollars pregnant.

479
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:56,475
$7 million dollars?

480
00:36:56,605 --> 00:36:58,390
This is a Lozroko
pile, isn't it?

481
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,043
So?

482
00:37:00,174 --> 00:37:01,741
Millions of dirty
dollars in this bank

483
00:37:01,871 --> 00:37:04,744
for one not only on its
way to fucking Mexico.

484
00:37:08,182 --> 00:37:10,053
Tony's going to shit.

485
00:37:10,184 --> 00:37:12,534
Let me worry about that, OK?

486
00:37:12,665 --> 00:37:15,885
On Saturday, that money willbe deposited in La Marage.

487
00:37:16,016 --> 00:37:19,106
And on Saturday night, withthe help of Mr. Barnes,

488
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,064
we will go into
that bank unseen.

489
00:37:21,195 --> 00:37:23,719
We will appropriate thosefunds for our own use.

490
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:24,938
You never said
you were stealing

491
00:37:25,068 --> 00:37:26,461
from your own brother-in-law.

492
00:37:26,592 --> 00:37:27,375
No, I didn't, did I?

493
00:37:27,506 --> 00:37:28,681
No, you didn't.

494
00:37:28,811 --> 00:37:31,249
You know how much
your share will be?

495
00:37:31,379 --> 00:37:32,859
He's a fucking mad man.

496
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:34,948
He'll kill us.

497
00:37:35,078 --> 00:37:36,471
He'll be so busy
trying to explain

498
00:37:36,602 --> 00:37:37,777
this fuckup to his bosses--

499
00:37:37,907 --> 00:37:39,561
He'll never got a
chance to explain.

500
00:37:39,692 --> 00:37:41,824
You're setting him up.

501
00:37:41,955 --> 00:37:42,912
Oh, what?

502
00:37:43,043 --> 00:37:44,044
So we're worried about Tony now?

503
00:37:44,174 --> 00:37:46,481
I thought you hated his guts.

504
00:37:46,612 --> 00:37:49,005
OK, I'll give him
a perfect patsy--

505
00:37:49,136 --> 00:37:52,618
a fall guy for all seasons.

506
00:37:52,748 --> 00:37:54,489
Jake?

507
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,577
So now you're
worried about him?

508
00:37:58,406 --> 00:38:03,106
He's a mutt, baby, aloser, lost in the desert.

509
00:38:06,022 --> 00:38:07,850
Well, he can stay lost
in the desert forever.

510
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,814
You got a problem with that?

511
00:38:14,944 --> 00:38:16,555
Kristin.

512
00:38:16,685 --> 00:38:19,384
[grunting]

513
00:38:19,514 --> 00:38:20,776
You, bitch.

514
00:38:20,907 --> 00:38:23,649
Hey, Barry.

515
00:38:23,779 --> 00:38:24,693
Take a walk, Phil.

516
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,133
[breathing hard]

517
00:38:30,264 --> 00:38:33,180
[inaudible],, baby, what youmade me do to your sister.

518
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,616
Don't, Barry.

519
00:38:34,747 --> 00:38:37,967
Not even Phil would want you.

520
00:38:38,098 --> 00:38:40,056
Be nice, daddy.

521
00:38:40,187 --> 00:38:41,319
I wasn't running away from you.

522
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:43,538
I was running away from Tony.

523
00:38:43,669 --> 00:38:45,061
And this Barnes?

524
00:38:45,192 --> 00:38:46,541
You sent me to do him.

525
00:38:46,672 --> 00:38:49,065
It's my job, remember?

526
00:38:49,196 --> 00:38:50,066
Remember, daddy?

527
00:38:53,156 --> 00:38:54,593
Then you finish your job.

528
00:38:57,465 --> 00:38:58,640
I will, daddy.

529
00:38:58,771 --> 00:39:00,947
When this is over,
we'll be together.

530
00:39:01,077 --> 00:39:02,296
No one can say shit about it.

531
00:39:02,427 --> 00:39:03,819
That's right.

532
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:06,213
That's right.

533
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,042
I want you now.

534
00:39:09,172 --> 00:39:12,393
[tears]

535
00:39:12,524 --> 00:39:15,396
No one loves you like I do baby.

536
00:39:15,527 --> 00:39:16,354
No one.

537
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,620
No one.

538
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,404
No one.

539
00:39:23,535 --> 00:39:27,365
No one.

Oh, hey, baby.

544
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:49,299
I'll be your baby doll.

545
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,300
Do you want to play?

546
00:39:50,431 --> 00:39:51,476
No, gracias.

547
00:39:51,606 --> 00:39:52,999
Would you like
to fuck me, pucky?

548
00:39:53,129 --> 00:39:55,436
No gracias.

549
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:56,916
Oh.

550
00:39:57,046 --> 00:40:00,789
You're think you'retoo good for me, pendejo?

551
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,748
Oh, Jakes Barnes.

552
00:40:02,878 --> 00:40:08,318
Oh, I don't fucking believe it.

553
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:11,278
Oye, papi, you going
to do this or not?

554
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,497
Get the fuck out of here.

556
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:30,732
Rosie, I don't think
we're the only ones

557
00:40:30,863 --> 00:40:31,603
that know about this drop.

558
00:40:34,954 --> 00:40:38,392
Now what the hell
does that mean?

559
00:40:38,523 --> 00:40:41,047
There's a girl
staying at my place.

560
00:40:41,177 --> 00:40:42,352
I picked her up the other night.

561
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:43,528
She lied about being
thrown off a bus.

562
00:40:43,658 --> 00:40:45,573
She's-- she's
staying with you?

563
00:40:45,704 --> 00:40:47,314
And she said her
boyfriend dumbed her,

564
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,576
but that was bullshit too.

565
00:40:48,707 --> 00:40:50,970
You've got some
girl staying with you?

566
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,451
Rosie, she's trying to get mein heat so she can reel me in.

567
00:40:53,581 --> 00:40:54,713
She's a fake.

568
00:40:54,843 --> 00:40:55,888
Oh, and just how
do you know that?

569
00:40:56,018 --> 00:40:56,758
Because I've
been there before.

570
00:40:56,889 --> 00:40:57,585
It's a failing of mine.

571
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,025
Are you fucking her?

572
00:41:03,156 --> 00:41:06,638
Well, are you?

573
00:41:06,768 --> 00:41:08,204
No, Rosie.

574
00:41:08,335 --> 00:41:09,118
I'm not fucking her.

575
00:41:12,121 --> 00:41:15,124
There's a guy working with her.

576
00:41:15,255 --> 00:41:18,040
A guy?

577
00:41:18,171 --> 00:41:18,911
A guy?

578
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:20,521
What guy?

579
00:41:20,652 --> 00:41:24,307
Smokes cigars, wears fancyshoes, came to the house

580
00:41:24,438 --> 00:41:26,135
in the middle of the night.- Shit, Jake.

581
00:41:26,266 --> 00:41:27,963
We have to worry about this.

582
00:41:28,094 --> 00:41:30,009
We have to worry about this.

583
00:41:30,139 --> 00:41:31,401
I knew she was scared.
Now I know why.

584
00:41:31,532 --> 00:41:32,315
I don't care why.

585
00:41:32,446 --> 00:41:33,229
You get rid of her now.

586
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,100
No.

587
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,710
Tonight.

588
00:41:35,841 --> 00:41:37,190
She stays.

589
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,366
We need to know
what they're doing.

590
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,280
She stays.

591
00:41:54,773 --> 00:41:55,513
OK.

592
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,474
But if they hit that
bag first, we'll

593
00:42:00,605 --> 00:42:03,956
never have another chance.

594
00:42:04,086 --> 00:42:04,826
We have to do it now.

595
00:42:08,134 --> 00:42:13,879
And if you fuck her,
I'll cut your dick off.

596
00:42:14,009 --> 00:42:17,273
Nothing's going to
stop us this time.

597
00:42:17,404 --> 00:42:18,927
Entiendes?

600
00:42:40,209 --> 00:42:43,648
You know, I used to stareacross that border every night

601
00:42:43,778 --> 00:42:47,956
and dream about the
land of opportunity,

602
00:42:48,087 --> 00:42:50,393
but dreams and realityare two different things.

603
00:42:54,659 --> 00:42:57,226
I'm hungry, Jake.

604
00:42:57,357 --> 00:42:58,880
I'm still hungry.

605
00:43:01,622 --> 00:43:02,362
Oh.

606
00:43:06,018 --> 00:43:08,063
But it's too late to eat now.

607
00:43:08,194 --> 00:43:08,890
I have to get back.

608
00:43:12,459 --> 00:43:15,157
So, uh, what movie
did I see tonight?

609
00:43:15,288 --> 00:43:18,160

Jake?

00:43:40,182 --> 00:43:42,097
Shh.

613
00:43:42,228 --> 00:43:43,055
Go back to sleep.

614
00:43:52,455 --> 00:43:53,413
Goddammit.

615
00:43:53,543 --> 00:43:55,110
I am not with that little whore.

616
00:43:55,241 --> 00:43:58,026
I told you that's over.

617
00:43:58,157 --> 00:43:58,897
I'm in Dallas.

618
00:44:01,769 --> 00:44:03,771
This is business.

619
00:44:03,902 --> 00:44:05,599
Don't tell me you're goingto ask Tony if it's business.

620
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:08,558
I'm smack you, Teresa.

621
00:44:08,689 --> 00:44:09,995
Now don't call your brother.

622
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:12,388
Don't call that son of a bitch.

623
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:13,302
You hear me?

624
00:44:13,433 --> 00:44:15,435
I mean it.

625
00:44:15,565 --> 00:44:16,566
Right.

626
00:44:16,697 --> 00:44:19,091
Now put Maria on.
God damn it.

627
00:44:19,221 --> 00:44:20,222
Put her on.

628
00:44:22,921 --> 00:44:24,444
Maria, honey.

629
00:44:24,574 --> 00:44:25,488
No, of course I didn't forget.

630
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:26,402
I'll be there.

631
00:44:26,533 --> 00:44:28,317
It's a done deal.

632
00:44:28,448 --> 00:44:31,973
Hey, didn't I say I'd be therefor your first communion?

633
00:44:32,104 --> 00:44:34,106
Then I'll be there.

634
00:44:34,236 --> 00:44:35,063
Right.

635
00:44:35,194 --> 00:44:36,978
OK, I love you too.

636
00:44:37,109 --> 00:44:39,502

Buenas noches, Jake.

00:44:48,294 --> 00:44:49,164

How you doing, partner?

Huh?

647
00:45:12,622 --> 00:45:14,886
How the fuck are you doing?

648
00:45:15,016 --> 00:45:18,628
You won't be needing this.

649
00:45:18,759 --> 00:45:20,413
Do I got your attention now?

650
00:45:20,543 --> 00:45:21,631
Huh?

651
00:45:21,762 --> 00:45:23,068
Do I have your
fucking attention?

652
00:45:23,198 --> 00:45:25,200
Good!
So tell me.

653
00:45:25,331 --> 00:45:28,421
What the fuck's
been going on here?

654
00:45:28,551 --> 00:45:31,076
I don't hear you talking, Jakey.

655
00:45:31,206 --> 00:45:32,860
Speak up!

656
00:45:32,991 --> 00:45:34,209
How the hell did you get out?

657
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,864
Oh, fuck that.

658
00:45:36,995 --> 00:45:38,605
What the fuck's going on?

659
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:39,519
huh?

660
00:45:39,649 --> 00:45:41,390
Nothing.

661
00:45:41,521 --> 00:45:44,654
Oh, you wouldn't be
living in this shithole

662
00:45:44,785 --> 00:45:46,526
for nothing, Jake.
Now, come on.

663
00:45:46,656 --> 00:45:48,789
You could do better than that.

664
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,705
Oh, shit.

665
00:45:51,836 --> 00:45:54,490
Well, as much as I'd like tosit around and chat with you,

666
00:45:54,621 --> 00:45:57,189
they're looking for me onthis side of the border.

667
00:45:57,319 --> 00:45:59,408
So let's say we hook up atthat itty bitty titty bar.

668
00:45:59,539 --> 00:46:01,193
Huh?

669
00:46:01,323 --> 00:46:02,455
It's the one across the streetfrom the hotel where you're

670
00:46:02,585 --> 00:46:06,024
banging your jefe's wife.

671
00:46:06,154 --> 00:46:07,503
All right then.

672
00:46:07,634 --> 00:46:08,940

[footsteps]

679
00:46:51,373 --> 00:46:53,593
What happened?

680
00:46:53,723 --> 00:46:55,464
I'm starting to get worried.

681
00:46:55,595 --> 00:46:56,378
Worried?

682
00:46:56,509 --> 00:46:57,249
Yeah.

683
00:46:59,512 --> 00:47:00,687
Now you tell me why
I should be worried.

684
00:47:07,128 --> 00:47:10,479
There's this man, calls
himself Barry Montana.

685
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:12,264
And Psyches is
looking for him?

686
00:47:12,394 --> 00:47:13,700
Pysches?

687
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,137
- Yeah, Psyches.- I don't know any Psyches.

688
00:47:20,968 --> 00:47:22,404
Never mind.

689
00:47:22,535 --> 00:47:23,710
Go on.

690
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:24,667
What's this Barry
got to do with me?

691
00:47:27,496 --> 00:47:29,063
- Your bank.
- My bank?

692
00:47:31,892 --> 00:47:33,372
He's going to rob it.

693
00:47:33,502 --> 00:47:34,373
He needs your help.

694
00:47:34,503 --> 00:47:36,636
That doesn't make any sense.

695
00:47:36,766 --> 00:47:39,030
The most we every carry
is $20,000 in cash.

696
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,336
It just wouldn't be worth it.

697
00:47:41,467 --> 00:47:42,947
Well, then Barry knows
something you don't.

698
00:47:43,077 --> 00:47:46,689
There's a lot more
than 20 grand.

699
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:47,777
This Barry's your boyfriend?

700
00:47:47,908 --> 00:47:50,302
No-- yes.

701
00:47:50,432 --> 00:47:52,870
Hell, he owns me, Jake.

702
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:53,958
Look, when I first met you--

703
00:47:54,088 --> 00:47:54,828
I was just a john.

704
00:47:58,701 --> 00:48:00,703
I was supposed to
get you to pick me.

705
00:48:00,834 --> 00:48:02,967
I was supposed to
sleep with you.

706
00:48:03,097 --> 00:48:05,708
I wasn't supposed
to feel anything.

707
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:07,623
What do you feel, Kristin?

708
00:48:07,754 --> 00:48:10,017
[footsteps]

709
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:15,370
I'm in the worst kind oftrouble you can imagine.

710
00:48:15,501 --> 00:48:16,241
Tell me about it.

711
00:48:20,593 --> 00:48:21,289
Really want to know?

712
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:28,775
Absolutely.

713
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:29,689
OK.

714
00:48:37,305 --> 00:48:42,136
My little sister and Icame over from Copenhagen.

715
00:48:42,267 --> 00:48:48,664
I saw an ad in the paper, modelswanted, and came to the States.

716
00:48:48,795 --> 00:48:50,884
I got a couple of jobs.

717
00:48:51,015 --> 00:48:59,240
I was sent to Vegas for a shootand fell in with a bad crowd--

718
00:48:59,371 --> 00:49:01,460
grass, coke.

719
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:02,374
I got hooked.

720
00:49:07,292 --> 00:49:13,211
Plenty guys were willing
to pay for my habit.

721
00:49:13,341 --> 00:49:17,780
And after a while, Ididn't care who they were

722
00:49:17,911 --> 00:49:21,567
or what they did to me.

723
00:49:21,697 --> 00:49:22,872
I met Barry at a party.

724
00:49:26,789 --> 00:49:30,358
There was this dealer
whom I more money than I

725
00:49:30,489 --> 00:49:34,101
could ever pay, and
he owed Barry money.

726
00:49:34,232 --> 00:49:38,976
So-- so he--

727
00:49:42,109 --> 00:49:42,980
he sold me to him.

728
00:49:45,852 --> 00:49:46,896
Barry got me dried out.

729
00:49:49,812 --> 00:49:50,900
Well, he owns me.

730
00:49:54,208 --> 00:49:57,472
He's connected.

731
00:49:57,603 --> 00:50:00,171
He married Anthony's
orphaned sister.

732
00:50:00,301 --> 00:50:05,741
They put him in charge ofthings, you know, like me.

733
00:50:12,096 --> 00:50:20,669
I still sleep with people,Jake, whoever he tells me to--

734
00:50:24,064 --> 00:50:27,372
he and his brother-in-law.

735
00:50:27,502 --> 00:50:31,550
And that son of a bitch
used me like a dog.

736
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:32,638
I ran away after that.

737
00:50:35,771 --> 00:50:39,427
Barry found me in two days.

738
00:50:39,558 --> 00:50:40,515
You know what he
did to me, Jake?

739
00:50:43,214 --> 00:50:43,997
Nothing.

740
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:49,959
But he found my little sister.

741
00:50:53,702 --> 00:50:59,360
He found her, and he cut
her, slashed her lips

open sideways like this.

743
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,760
She didn't know
who he was or why

744
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:11,285
he did it, just as some
guy came out of hell

745
00:51:11,416 --> 00:51:12,504
and cut her with a knife.

746
00:51:16,638 --> 00:51:17,422
But I knew.

747
00:51:20,425 --> 00:51:23,254
Yup.

748
00:51:23,384 --> 00:51:27,649

me where she lives,

903
01:02:52,899 --> 01:02:54,031
and I'll take care of her.

Fine.

926
01:04:04,536 --> 01:04:06,538
Then we split the
money fair and square.

927
01:04:06,668 --> 01:04:08,235
Fairly, yes.

928
01:04:08,366 --> 01:04:11,630
But according to everyone'srelative contribution.

929
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,198
Your cut is 15%.

930
01:04:14,328 --> 01:04:15,068
Nice talking to you.

931
01:04:18,028 --> 01:04:20,595
Mr. Barnes, I do understand.

932
01:04:20,726 --> 01:04:22,206
I mean, I'm breezing
out of town.

933
01:04:22,336 --> 01:04:25,383
I'm done, but you're throwingaway a whole life here.

934
01:04:25,513 --> 01:04:27,428
You've got a history
in this town.

935
01:04:27,559 --> 01:04:28,473
People know you.

936
01:04:28,603 --> 01:04:29,778
People will be looking for me.

937
01:04:29,909 --> 01:04:31,563
That too.

938
01:04:31,693 --> 01:04:33,434
20%.

939
01:04:33,565 --> 01:04:35,436
And without my
code key, it'll take

940
01:04:35,567 --> 01:04:36,960
another hour to crack the safe.

941
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:37,830
30.

942
01:04:40,789 --> 01:04:42,313
25.

943
01:04:42,443 --> 01:04:44,315
Cash at the split.

944
01:04:44,445 --> 01:04:45,316
Where do we do it?

945
01:04:45,446 --> 01:04:46,665
Your place.

946
01:04:46,795 --> 01:04:48,885
OK, but we leave
the guns in the car.

947
01:04:49,015 --> 01:04:50,712
We have a deal.

948
01:04:50,843 --> 01:04:52,627
How long do you need to get in?

949
01:04:52,758 --> 01:04:54,978
A few seconds to
shut down the system.

950
01:04:55,108 --> 01:04:56,849
Good.

951
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:59,591
How long for the lock?

952
01:04:59,721 --> 01:05:02,333
With your key and the oneprogrammed into this computer,

953
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:04,117
we have no problem.

954
01:05:04,248 --> 01:05:05,902
We're dealing with one of thenew Brinkman electrons, right?

955
01:05:06,032 --> 01:05:07,338
That's standard.

956
01:05:07,468 --> 01:05:09,079
No special modifications?

957
01:05:09,209 --> 01:05:10,471
Fine.

958
01:05:10,602 --> 01:05:12,473
This baby will crack
in seven minutes max.

959
01:05:12,604 --> 01:05:13,605
That'll work.

960
01:05:13,735 --> 01:05:15,389
A plus moves, say 11.

961
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,957
Sheriff drives throughevery half hour on the nose.

962
01:05:18,088 --> 01:05:21,134
Every hour he gets out ofthe car to check the door.

963
01:05:21,265 --> 01:05:25,791
We watch him do his thing at3:30 in and out at 15 max.

964
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:28,968
It gives us at least
a 12 minute cushion.

965
01:05:29,099 --> 01:05:31,623
Well, that's it.

966
01:05:31,753 --> 01:05:32,537
Let's go.

967
01:05:36,497 --> 01:05:39,022
She stays here.

968
01:05:39,152 --> 01:05:40,371
I don't think so.

969
01:05:43,635 --> 01:05:44,331
You got what you wanted.

970
01:05:48,379 --> 01:05:49,858
Very well.

971
01:05:49,989 --> 01:05:51,425
Be here tomorrow.

972
01:05:51,556 --> 01:05:52,296

I hate this shit.

976
01:06:02,697 --> 01:06:03,916
Why?

977
01:06:04,047 --> 01:06:07,311
I mean, she's only
doing what she does.

978
01:06:07,441 --> 01:06:08,660
And what's that?

979
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:11,358
You know, you
sic her on a John,

980
01:06:11,489 --> 01:06:13,404

982
01:06:14,622 --> 01:06:15,797
What?

983
01:06:15,928 --> 01:06:17,625
So she's the whore
and I'm her pimp?

984
01:06:17,756 --> 01:06:19,540
I do chink work.Is that what you're saying?

985
01:06:19,671 --> 01:06:20,628
Yeah.

986
01:06:20,759 --> 01:06:22,108
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

987
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:23,501
Only you can't stand to hear it.

988
01:06:27,418 --> 01:06:28,506
She owes me.

989
01:06:28,636 --> 01:06:31,378
She owes you shit.

990
01:06:31,509 --> 01:06:34,903
You think she loves you
because you love her?

991
01:06:35,034 --> 01:06:35,992
I think she'd like
to see you dead.

992
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:43,564
Phil, please don't think.

993
01:06:43,695 --> 01:06:48,221
I know you mean well, but it'llonly get you into trouble.

We don't need it.

1021
01:13:05,816 --> 01:13:09,907
I know, but it's nice.

1022
01:13:10,037 --> 01:13:10,864

Ah, not so fast there, cowboy.

1031
01:14:15,755 --> 01:14:16,800
I've shown you mine.

Well, that's done.

Are we going to go
grab a drink or what?

Have a drink
when it's all over.

1036

going to do, right?

you'll never drink again.

I don't ask much
of you, Kristin.

1052
01:15:34,921 --> 01:15:37,184
No, Barry, you're
not at all demanding.

1053
01:15:37,315 --> 01:15:41,711
Can I remind you of what youwere when I first found you?

1054
01:15:41,841 --> 01:15:46,237
You were a little
coke whore, dead meat

with the vultures circling.

1056
01:15:49,675 --> 01:15:50,502
That's--

1057
01:15:50,633 --> 01:15:52,939
That's the truth.

1058
01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:55,812
What were you?

1059
01:15:55,942 --> 01:15:57,640
Dead probably.

1060
01:15:57,770 --> 01:16:00,599
That's right.

1061
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:03,820
I gave you your life.

1062
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:05,561

No.

You have feelings
for him, don't you?

01:16:27,017 --> 01:16:27,757
No, Barry.

1070
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:32,892

get killed in this.

01:20:02,493 --> 01:20:06,105
Her son is so hot and so wild.

1112
01:20:06,236 --> 01:20:07,237
I say we go in.

1113
01:20:07,367 --> 01:20:08,151
Fuck the fucking sheriff.

1114
01:20:08,281 --> 01:20:09,500
No, Phil.

1115
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:11,545
We do not fuck with
the fucking sheriff.

1116
01:20:11,676 --> 01:20:13,373
One dead cop, and they'llnever leave us alone.

1117
01:20:13,504 --> 01:20:15,158
There could have beenan accident on the highway

1118
01:20:15,288 --> 01:20:16,637
or a barroom fight.

1119
01:20:16,768 --> 01:20:18,074
We're not way of knowing.

1120
01:20:18,204 --> 01:20:20,163
We should have brought
a scanner like I said.

1121
01:20:20,293 --> 01:20:21,860
Shut up.

1122
01:20:21,991 --> 01:20:26,386
OK, let's assume thesheriff's missed this too.

1123
01:20:26,517 --> 01:20:28,084
God, I hate to assume.

1124
01:20:38,355 --> 01:20:39,443
Can we go in now?

1125
01:20:47,364 --> 01:20:50,628
[beeping]

1126
01:20:50,758 --> 01:20:52,108
347.

1127
01:20:52,238 --> 01:20:53,283
Give me your key.

1128
01:20:53,413 --> 01:20:54,545
We've got 13 minutes.

[beeps]

1135
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:02,308
One to go.

01:22:05,442 --> 01:22:08,271
[thunder]

1138
01:22:18,890 --> 01:22:20,196
It's the sheriff.

1139
01:22:28,334 --> 01:22:31,642
[thunder]

1140
01:23:00,627 --> 01:23:03,979
[footsteps]

1141
01:23:18,863 --> 01:23:22,171
OK, it's clear.

1142
01:23:22,301 --> 01:23:25,478
[beeping]

1143
01:23:25,609 --> 01:23:27,872
Shit.

1144
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:29,308
You've got time.

1145
01:23:29,439 --> 01:23:32,833
Do it.

1146
01:23:32,964 --> 01:23:34,705

[whirring]

1149
01:23:44,497 --> 01:23:46,847
Bingo.

1150
01:23:46,978 --> 01:23:50,373
Open sesame.

1151
01:23:50,503 --> 01:23:53,811
[mechanical sounds]

1152
01:24:11,785 --> 01:24:14,614
[opening doors]

1153
01:24:22,231 --> 01:24:24,624
The guns stay in the car.

1154
01:24:24,755 --> 01:24:25,843
You just don't
trust me, do you?

1155
01:24:25,973 --> 01:24:26,757
Nope.

1156
01:24:26,887 --> 01:24:27,627
Same here.

1157
01:24:27,758 --> 01:24:28,802
Check him.

1158
01:24:28,933 --> 01:24:31,631
[patting]

1159
01:24:36,984 --> 01:24:38,247
He's clean.

1160
01:24:38,377 --> 01:24:39,726
You didn't have a gun?

1161
01:24:39,857 --> 01:24:41,467
Didn't need one.

1162
01:24:41,598 --> 01:24:43,904
Sweet.

1163
01:24:44,035 --> 01:24:46,864

All right.

1167
01:25:06,797 --> 01:25:08,668
Open them up.

[clicking]

1169
01:25:13,804 --> 01:25:14,587
Shit.

1170
01:25:17,721 --> 01:25:19,114
Where's my fucking money?

1171
01:25:24,815 --> 01:25:29,428
I admire your style, Mr. Barnes.

1172
01:25:29,559 --> 01:25:32,170
Shut up.

1173
01:25:32,301 --> 01:25:34,041
Car in the garage?

1174
01:25:34,172 --> 01:25:36,392
There's a leather bagbehind the driver's seat.

1175
01:25:36,522 --> 01:25:37,828
Bring it in here please.

1176
01:25:40,918 --> 01:25:44,748
[footsteps]

1177
01:25:45,836 --> 01:25:48,534
OK, let me see.

1178
01:25:48,665 --> 01:25:50,710
Let me see.

1179
01:25:50,841 --> 01:25:53,496
You already cleaned
out the money, right?

1180
01:25:53,626 --> 01:25:54,801
Very good.

1181
01:25:54,932 --> 01:25:56,586
Very, very good.

1182
01:25:56,716 --> 01:25:57,630
What was your cut?

1183
01:25:57,761 --> 01:25:58,979
A half?

1184
01:25:59,110 --> 01:26:00,590
A third?

1185
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,287
A half.

1186
01:26:02,418 --> 01:26:03,723
Great.

1187
01:26:03,854 --> 01:26:05,638
You just gave Kristin a
lot of traveling money.

1188
01:26:05,769 --> 01:26:08,293
Shut up, Phil.

1189
01:26:08,424 --> 01:26:09,164
She'll be back.

1190
01:26:23,656 --> 01:26:26,964
[music playing]

1191
01:26:40,934 --> 01:26:43,198
Thanks, Kristin.

1192
01:26:43,328 --> 01:26:44,982
Now what?

1193
01:26:45,112 --> 01:26:47,419
Go ahead, Phil open it up.

1194
01:26:47,550 --> 01:26:50,292
[unzipping]

1195
01:26:58,169 --> 01:26:58,952
It's all yours.

1196
01:26:59,083 --> 01:27:01,955
Take it and go.

1197
01:27:02,086 --> 01:27:04,349
He's offered us
the fucking money.

1198
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,090
I don't want it.

1199
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:07,265
What do you mean?

1200
01:27:07,396 --> 01:27:08,832
I mean, that's a
good deal, Barry.

1201
01:27:08,962 --> 01:27:11,748
This is fucking great.

1202
01:27:11,878 --> 01:27:14,577
You lied to me.

1203
01:27:14,707 --> 01:27:17,493
You let this little
prick get to you.

1204
01:27:17,623 --> 01:27:20,060
That's not real
professional, Kristin.

1205
01:27:20,191 --> 01:27:22,585
Back off.

1206
01:27:22,715 --> 01:27:23,499
Barry.

1207
01:27:23,629 --> 01:27:25,109
I don't want the money.

1208
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:28,852
Pack it up and
get out of here.

1209
01:27:28,982 --> 01:27:31,768
I told you I don't
want the fucking money.

1210
01:27:34,553 --> 01:27:35,641
Well, I fucking do.

1211
01:27:38,731 --> 01:27:40,124
Put it down, Barry.

1212
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:41,212
Come on, Barry.

1213
01:27:41,343 --> 01:27:44,563
Fuck this.

1214
01:27:44,694 --> 01:27:45,521
[gunshots]

1215
01:27:45,651 --> 01:27:48,393
[moan]

1216
01:27:52,963 --> 01:27:54,660
Right there, Barry.

1217
01:27:54,791 --> 01:27:56,401
So here's the deal.

1218
01:27:56,532 --> 01:27:59,012
You keep the money,
and I take Kristin.

1219
01:27:59,143 --> 01:28:00,753
He's working an angle, Jake.

1220
01:28:00,884 --> 01:28:02,146
Shoot him.

1221
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:03,800
She thinks she's
one smart lady, Jake.

1222
01:28:03,930 --> 01:28:06,150
But really she's
just a little whore.

1223
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:07,586
He knows that, Barry.

1224
01:28:07,717 --> 01:28:10,067
He knows everything,
even that you pimped

1225
01:28:10,197 --> 01:28:11,460
me to your own brother-in-law.

1226
01:28:11,590 --> 01:28:13,200
Tony made me do that, baby.

1227
01:28:13,331 --> 01:28:14,376
Don't you get it?

1228
01:28:14,506 --> 01:28:15,507
He fucked you to
teach me a lesson.

1229
01:28:15,638 --> 01:28:16,726
Teach you a lesson?

1230
01:28:16,856 --> 01:28:17,988
Yeah, I was going
to leave my wife,

1231
01:28:18,118 --> 01:28:20,164
my kid, everything, for her.

1232
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:23,080
But Tony couldn't let thathappen, not in his family.

1233
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:24,124
He's crazy, Jake.

1234
01:28:24,255 --> 01:28:27,214
So he had her to dishonor me.

1235
01:28:27,345 --> 01:28:30,305
This is all about you gettingeven with your brother-in-law?

1236
01:28:30,435 --> 01:28:31,741
My oath.

1237
01:28:31,871 --> 01:28:33,351
This is all about your honor.

1238
01:28:33,482 --> 01:28:35,440
Honor, yeah.

1239
01:28:35,571 --> 01:28:37,094
But now I'm teaching
him a lesson.

1240
01:28:37,224 --> 01:28:41,098
The bank was his operation,and I fucked it, big man.

1241
01:28:41,228 --> 01:28:42,926
We'll see how big
a man he is when

1242
01:28:43,056 --> 01:28:44,536
he has to tell
his goombah family

1243
01:28:44,667 --> 01:28:47,104
that he lost their money.

1244
01:28:47,234 --> 01:28:48,714
Since you're a man ofhonor, I guess that makes

1245
01:28:48,845 --> 01:28:50,934
everything all right.

1246
01:28:51,064 --> 01:28:56,418
God's truth, Jake, I love her.

1247
01:28:56,548 --> 01:28:59,377
[gunshots]

1248
01:28:59,508 --> 01:29:02,293
[crashes and moans]

1249
01:29:06,819 --> 01:29:07,690
You're shot.

1250
01:29:07,820 --> 01:29:08,517
You're shot.

1251
01:29:13,652 --> 01:29:16,089
I gotta tell you, Jake.

1252
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:17,569
I'm not real impressed
with your new gang.

1253
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:19,136
[laughs]
Now get up.

1254
01:29:19,266 --> 01:29:21,138
Get the fuck up.

1255
01:29:25,011 --> 01:29:26,796
I thought you were
going to stay in Juarez.

1256
01:29:26,926 --> 01:29:28,450
But I'm just a bad penny.

1257
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:29,712
Look, Pysches.

1258
01:29:29,842 --> 01:29:30,756
Take the cases and go.

1259
01:29:30,887 --> 01:29:31,801
We don't need any more killing.

1260
01:29:31,931 --> 01:29:33,324
Oh yeah, we do bloody.

1261
01:29:33,455 --> 01:29:35,457
A few more bodies willreally fuck up the trail,

1262
01:29:35,587 --> 01:29:36,414
don't you think?

1263
01:29:36,545 --> 01:29:37,284
Huh?

1264
01:29:37,415 --> 01:29:38,198
Don't you think?

1265
01:29:42,159 --> 01:29:45,467
Now who's the asshole
bleeding on my money?

1266
01:29:45,597 --> 01:29:49,993
Don't you mean
our money, partner?

1267
01:29:50,123 --> 01:29:52,387
Pick it up, Psyches.

1268
01:29:52,517 --> 01:29:54,563
You stay there, Jake.

1269
01:29:54,693 --> 01:29:57,566
You're good on your knees.

1270
01:29:57,696 --> 01:30:00,003
[moaning]

1271
01:30:00,133 --> 01:30:03,310
You two going to head
back across the border?

1272
01:30:03,441 --> 01:30:05,095
You want to know something?

1273
01:30:05,225 --> 01:30:06,357
The only times
I've been to Mexico

1274
01:30:06,488 --> 01:30:10,405
were with you in
that cheesy motel.

1275
01:30:10,535 --> 01:30:11,318
I'm from Seattle.

1276
01:30:19,022 --> 01:30:19,849
What'd she promise you?

1277
01:30:23,461 --> 01:30:24,506
You die.

1278
01:30:24,636 --> 01:30:29,946
You die, and then
I get your cut--

1279
01:30:30,076 --> 01:30:30,860
pretty simple.

1280
01:30:34,472 --> 01:30:37,780
[gunshot]

1281
01:30:42,915 --> 01:30:45,744
[footsteps]

1282
01:30:55,841 --> 01:30:58,540
Simple is stupid, remember?

1283
01:31:02,065 --> 01:31:04,415
Just get the case, Ed.

1284
01:31:04,546 --> 01:31:05,982
How long you've
been planning this?

1285
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:07,287
Years.

1286
01:31:07,418 --> 01:31:08,288
We were just
waiting for the right

1287
01:31:08,419 --> 01:31:09,942
jerk-off to come through town.

1288
01:31:13,946 --> 01:31:16,079
Well, you two
sure had me fooled.

1289
01:31:16,209 --> 01:31:18,342
Then you were just about thebest piece of ass I ever had,

1290
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:19,256
Rosie.

1291
01:31:22,433 --> 01:31:25,305
Now when you said Ed neverfucked you like I did,

1292
01:31:25,436 --> 01:31:29,222
