<i>IN THE DARK CANYONS</i>
<i>THAT LACE THE MALIBU COAST</i>

35

<i>AND IN THE TEEMING MIDST</i>
<i>OF FADED AND BACKWATER ESTATES.</i>

<i>A BIG HOUSE</i>
<i>BUILT BY BIG DREAMS</i>

<i>TO REAL-LIFE SHIT,</i>

<i>OF CHEAP PLASTER</i>
<i>AND CHEAPER ROOF TILE,</i>

<i>DATING APPARENTLY</i>
<i>FROM THE MID-'80s</i>

50

<i>AND FITTED WITH MULTI-LEVELS</i>
<i>AND SPLIT-LEVELS</i>

<i>OF PLENTIFUL CASH AND CREDIT</i>

54
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:45,957
<i>THE RESULT 20 YEARS LATER</i>
<i>STUNK OF A MESSY DIVORCE.</i>

55
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,229
-  <i>AT LEAST THE AIR WAS CLEAN..</i>
<i>-</i>  <i>( crows cawing )</i>

56
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,932
<i>...AND THERE WAS NO ONE</i>
<i>TO SEE HOW FAR I'VE FALLEN.</i>

57
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,601
<i>IN THE SPRING</i>
<i>I HAD SECURED</i>

<i>SOME DREARY AND UNPROFITABLE</i>
<i>REWRITE WORK</i>

59
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:01,072
<i>FOR SOME GUTTER-SCUM</i>
<i>PRODUCTION COMPANY.</i>

60
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:04,042
<i>AFTER THAT WENT BAD--</i>
<i>LIKELY BECAUSE I TOLD</i>
<i>THE PRODUCER</i>

61
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,144
<i>WHAT I REALLY THOUGHT</i>
<i>OF HIS WORK...</i>

62

Woman:
CHARLIE BAXTER.

63
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:10,982
- Charlie: MRS. HAYWARD.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

64
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:15,887
-  <i>...AND BEING UNABLE TO PAY</i>
<i>ANY SUBSTANTIAL RENT...</i>
<i>- KEEP GOING AROUND.</i>

65
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,990
- OKAY.
- <i>...I BEGAN DRIFTING FROM ONE</i>
<i>CHEAP APARTMENT TO ANOTHER</i>

66
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,226
<i>UNTIL I WAS DOWN</i>
<i>TO LOOKING FOR A ROOM.</i>

67
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,996
<i>I HAD HOPED TO FIND SOMEPLACE</i>
<i>WHERE I COULD PUSH THROUGH</i>
<i>MY WRITER'S BLOCK</i>

68
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:29,234
- <i>AND FINISH</i>
<i>MY OWN GREAT SCREENPLAY.</i>
<i>- WAS IT EASY TO FIND?</i>

69
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:32,938
Charlie's voice:
<i>BUT RIGHT THEN, I NEEDED</i>
<i>A PLACE THAT WAS CHEAP...</i>

70
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,006
PLEASE, COME ON IN.

71
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,742
<i>...BUT CLEAN AND QUIET.</i>

72
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,613
- Charlie: <i>NICE PLACE.</i>
<i>-</i>  <i>( door closes )</i>

73
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:44,182
Charlie's voice:
<i>IN THE ROOMS, LARGE AND LOFTY</i>

74
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:47,118
<i>AND DECORATED</i>
<i>WITH SCHIZOPHRENIC TASTE</i>

75
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,588
<i>AND RIDICULOUS KITSCH,</i>

76
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,023
<i>THERE LINGERED</i>
<i>A DEPRESSING MUSTINESS</i>

77
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:56,328
<i>AND A HINT OF OBSCURE...</i>
<i>SOMETHING.</i>

78
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,331
<i>SOMETHING I COULDN'T</i>
<i>QUITE PLACE AT THAT MOMENT.</i>

79
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,633
Mrs. Hayward:
IT'S SO BIG.

80
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:04,736
HARD TO KEEP UP
WITH JUST MYSELF
AND MY DAUGHTER.

81
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:06,838
STILL, YOU'VE DONE WONDERS.

82
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,042
- I LIKE THE ANIMALS.
- AREN'T THEY PRECIOUS?

83
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,812
THEY WANDERED
ONTO THE PROPERTY ONE DAY.

84
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:16,047
FIRST THE GOATS,
THEN THE SHEEP.

85
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:18,650
YOU'RE TRYING
TO GET THEM TO EAT
SOME OF THAT TALL GRASS.

86
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:21,052
THAT WAS THE HOPE.
I'M A LITTLE BRITTLE

87
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,854
TO BE WEED WHACKING
THE PROPERTY.

88
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,923
- HAVE TO, YOU KNOW.
- WILD FIRES, RIGHT?

89
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:27,726
THAT'S RIGHT.
BIG FINE IF YOU DON'T.

90
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,260
WELL, MAYBE I CAN
HELP YOU THERE.

91
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:32,130
YOU WIELD
A MEAN WHACKER, CHARLIE?

92
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,101
I LOVE THE FLOORS.

93
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:39,170
Charlie's voice:
<i>THE WOOD WAS NOT</i>
<i>EXACTLY SPECIAL,</i>

94
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:41,239
<i>BUT THE FLOORS WERE CLEAN.</i>

95
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,908
Mrs. Hayward:
<i>IF YOU DON'T REQUIRE</i>
<i>A CERTAIN MEAL,</i>

96
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,679
I'D APPRECIATE THE NOTICE
SO I DON'T OVER-PREPARE.

97
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:50,782
THE FAMILY ROOM IS
A COMMON ROOM.

98
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:52,751
WE DO HAVE SATELLITE.

99
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:54,719
WOW.  SATELLITE.

100
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,022
I DATE THE GUY
AT THE LOCAL RADIO SHACK.

101
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:59,090
HE GIVES ME
THE PROGRAMS FOR FREE.

102
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:03,094
- GREAT.
- ANYTHING WE CAN DO
TO MAKE ENDS MEET.

103
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:06,264
- IT ALL HELPS.
- EXACTLY.

104
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,667
YOU UNDERSTAND.

105
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,969
YOU ARE
IN THE BUSINESS.

106
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,205
UH, WHAT ABOUT LAUNDRY?

107
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:16,775
IT'S $10 EXTRA PER LOAD,

108
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:19,110
AND I DON'T DO
ANYTHING EXOTIC.

109
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:22,013
POCKETS HAVE TO BE CLEAR.
IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?

110
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,883
THERE'S A LAUNDROMAT IN MALIBU
IF THAT'S TOO STEEP.

111
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:28,119
( smacks lips )
SOUNDS REASONABLE.

112
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:31,056
- I THINK SO.
- Charlie's voice:
<i>THE TOUR CONTINUED.</i>

113
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:36,027
<i>AS IT TURNED OUT,</i>
<i>THE LINEN CHANGE WAS</i>
<i>TOLERABLY REGULAR</i>

114

<i>AND THE HOT WATER</i>
<i>NOT TOO OFTEN COLD</i>
<i>OR TURNED OFF,</i>

115
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,133
<i>SO THAT I CAME</i>
<i>TO REGARD IT</i>

116
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:44,369
<i>AS AT LEAST</i>
<i>A BEARABLE PLACE</i>
<i>TO HUNKER DOWN</i>

117

<i>UNTIL I MIGHT</i>
<i>REALLY LIVE AGAIN.</i>

118
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,440
YOU WILL SHARE
THIS BATHROOM.

119
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:51,209
DON'T GO UP THERE,
ALL RIGHT?

120
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,781

MORE TOWELS,

121

THEY'RE RIGHT

122
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:01,219
AND, WELL,
HERE'S YOUR ROOM.

<i>SINCE I WAS FINDING MYSELF</i>
<i>JUST MAKING IT</i>

162

- <i>A MAN NAMED ARNOLD DELTOID.</i>
<i>-</i> <i>( whirring, hissing )</i>

165
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:47,318
<i>MRS. HAYWARD SAID</i>
<i>DELTOID HAD BEEN</i>
<i>AN ANIMATOR AT DISNEY</i>

166
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,487
<i>DURING THE STUDIO'S GOLDEN AGE</i>
<i>BACK IN THE '50s...</i>

167
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,322
THERE'S SOMETHING LEAKING
IN MY ROOM FROM--

168
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:53,324
<i>...BEFORE EVERYTHING</i>
<i>BECAME DIGITAL,</i>

169
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:56,060
<i>BEFORE HE GOT</i>
<i>FORCIBLY RETIRED.</i>

170
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,263
<i>NOW HE WAS HOLED UP HERE,</i>

171
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:00,331
-  <i>DESPERATELY TRYING</i>
<i>TO LEARN SOFTWARE...</i>
<i>- HELLO?</i>

172
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,534
<i>...THAT WOULD ALLOW</i>
<i>HIM TO EARN A LIVING</i>
<i>IN THE 21st CENTURY.</i>

173
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,172
<i>THE OTHER LODGER</i>
<i>WAS A MYSTERY.</i>

174
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:11,242
<i>MRS. HAYWARD HAD DEFLECTED</i>
<i>ALL MY QUESTIONS,</i>

175
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,344
<i>WHICH JUST JACKED UP</i>
<i>MY CURIOSITY.</i>

176
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:16,347
<i>THE LODGER NEVER LEFT</i>
<i>THE ROOM, AS FAR AS I KNEW.</i>

177
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:20,485
<i>MRS. HAYWARD DELIVERED</i>
<i>THREE SQUARES TO HIM DAILY.</i>

178
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:23,354
<i>A COUPLE TIMES I HEARD</i>
<i>WHAT SOUNDED LIKE A COUGH.</i>

179
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:29,360
<i>SOMETHING LIKE</i>
<i>AN AIR CONDITIONER</i>
<i>GOING FULL BLAST.</i>

180
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,362
<i>BUT MORE...</i>

<i>GOING ON IN THE ROOM</i>
<i>AT THE END OF THE HALL,</i>

186

<i>AND, TO BE HONEST,</i>

187
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,592
<i>TO LEARN A LITTLE MORE</i>
<i>ABOUT THIS MYSTERY LODGER...</i>

<i>...PUSHED BY MY CURIOSITY,</i>

190
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,733
<i>I HURRIED OUTSIDE</i>
<i>TO FIND THE LANDLADY.</i>

191

- OH! ( gasps )

192
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:16,307
OH, GOOD MORNING,
CHARLIE.

193
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,276
HAD BREAKFAST YET?
IT ENDS IN 10 MINUTES.

194
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:20,311
YEAH, THANKS, MRS. HAYWARD,
I'LL GET RIGHT ON THAT.

195
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:24,015
THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE ACCIDENT.
NOT TO WORRY, CHARLIE.

196
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:26,517
WE'RE TAKING
CARE OF IT RIGHT NOW.
SORRY IF IT DISTURBED YOU.

197

<i>- THE DOCTOR'S ACCIDENTS.</i>

204
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,652

<i>- WHAT KIND OF ACCIDENTS?</i>

205
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:36,754

206
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:42,060
I ONLY HEAR IT.
NEVER ACTUALLY SEEN THE DOCTOR

207
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:45,296

OF HIS... ROOM.

208
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:47,698

- THAT KIND OF SERVICE.
- ( chuckles )

210
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:53,538
WHAT'S RENT MONEY
TO A DOCTOR, ANYWAY?

211
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,507
<i>EXACTLY.  WHY WOULD</i>
<i>A DOCTOR RENT A ROOM?</i>

212
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:02,180
DON'T KNOW
AND FRANKLY, DON'T CARE.
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

213
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:04,615
THE DOCTOR WAS ALREADY HERE
BEFORE I ARRIVED.

214
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:12,457
- MRS. HAYWARD EVER
TALK ABOUT HIM?
- <i>NOPE.</i>

215

I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF IT'S A HIM OR A HER.

216
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,642
SHE SAID YOU WERE
A SCREENWRITER?

217
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:35,346

220
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,194
WANNABE.

221
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:52,530

AUTISTIC,

- NO, IT'S FINE.
- I'M SO SORRY.

WELL, WOULDN'T THE DOCTOR
BE BETTER OFF--

251

WELL, YES, BUT THE DOCTOR

324
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:25,309
<i>AN INFINITE AMOUNT</i>
<i>OF MADNESS IN THE MIND</i>

325
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:27,678
<i>OF A ONCE POWERFUL</i>
<i>AND WEALTHY PERSON</i>

326
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,413
<i>WHO HAS FALLEN DOWN</i>
<i>IN THE WORLD.</i>

327
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,052
<i>I MIGHT NEVER</i>
<i>HAVE MET DR. SHOCKNER</i>

328
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:37,755
<i>EXCEPT FOR THE HEART ATTACK</i>
<i>THAT SUDDENLY STRUCK ME</i>

329
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:40,290
<i>THAT AFTERNOON AS I PREPARED</i>
<i>TO VACATE MY ROOM.</i>

330
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:43,727
<i>( heartbeat continues )</i>

331
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:49,166
( thuds )

332
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:52,903
<i>I KNEW I WAS</i>
<i>IN TROUBLE,</i>

333
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:55,706
<i>AND I KNEW THERE WAS</i>
<i>NO TIME TO WASTE.</i>

334
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:59,209
( thuds )

335
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:09,453
<i>MY BRAIN WAS FRYING.</i>

336
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:12,056
<i>MY CHEST WAS EXPLODING.</i>

337
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:14,158
<i>( heartbeat continues )</i>

338
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,328
<i>I REALIZED</i>
<i>I WAS HAVING A STROKE</i>

339
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:22,199
- <i>AS A COMPANION</i>
<i>TO MY HEART FAILURE.</i>
<i>- ( distorted breathing )</i>

340
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:38,415
<i>( heartbeat continues )</i>

341
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,753
<i>I REMEMBER THINKING</i>
<i>HOW SURREAL IT ALL WAS.</i>

342
00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:45,089
<i>I THINK,</i>
<i>BUT I CAN'T BE POSITIVE,</i>

343
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:49,927
<i>THAT I HEARD</i>
<i>HUMMING AS I SAW</i>
<i>THE WHITE LIGHT OF HEAVEN.</i>

344
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:52,930
<i>OR WAS IT THE GLOW</i>
<i>FROM THE FURNACES OF HELL?</i>

345
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:56,767
<i>IN THAT MOMENT</i>
<i>IT DIDN'T MATTER.</i>

346
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:01,171
<i>CHARLIE BAXTER HAD FOUND</i>
<i>HIS MOMENT OF GRACE</i>

347
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:04,208
<i>AND IT WAS SCORED</i>
<i>BY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HUMMING</i>

348
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,909
<i>HE HAD EVER HEARD.</i>

349
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:12,449
<i>( hissing )</i>

350
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:20,190
<i>AFTER A MOMENT,</i>
<i>I COULD HEAR</i>

351
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:22,760
<i>WHAT I THINK WAS</i>
<i>THE SOUND OF A FOOTFALL,</i>

352
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:25,529
<i>THEN THERE CAME AN OPENING</i>
<i>OF THE DOOR IN FRONT OF ME.</i>

353
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:28,499
( creaking )

354
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:31,001
<i>A RUSH OF COOL AIR</i>
<i>GREETED ME,</i>

355
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:34,204
<i>AND THOUGH THE DAY</i>
<i>WAS ONE OF THE HOTTEST</i>
<i>OF THAT SUMMER...</i>

356
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:36,273
- <i>( distorted footsteps )</i>
<i>-</i> <i>...I SHIVERED.</i>

357
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:41,545
<i>I NOW SAW A TABLE OF BOTTLES</i>
<i>AND MACHINES AND SYRINGES</i>

358
00:29:41,547 --> 00:29:43,280
<i>WHICH MRS. HAYWARD</i>
<i>HAD MENTIONED.</i>

359
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:45,983
<i>THIS WAS THE LABORATORY</i>
<i>OF THE DOCTOR.</i>

360
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:48,452
<i>DR. SHOCKNER</i>
<i>MOST CERTAINLY WAS</i>

361
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:51,889
<i>A PERSON OF EDUCATION,</i>
<i>TASTE AND WEALTH.</i>

362
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:53,824
( woman speaks )

363
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:02,933
<i>THEN A FIGURE</i>
<i>APPEARED OVER ME.</i>

364
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:06,236
<i>THE FIGURE WAS SHORT</i>
<i>BUT EXQUISITELY PROPORTIONED</i>

365
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:10,174
<i>AND WORE A SOMEWHAT FORMAL</i>
<i>RODEO DRIVE WARDROBE</i>

366
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,442
<i>OF PERFECT CUT AND FIT.</i>

367
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:16,246
<i>NEVERTHELESS,</i>

368
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:19,383
<i>AS I SAW DR. SHOCKNER</i>
<i>IN THAT BLAST OF COOL AIR,</i>

369
00:30:19,385 --> 00:30:21,952
<i>I FELT A REPUGNANCE</i>

370
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:25,222
<i>WHICH NOTHING</i>
<i>IN THE DOCTOR'S LOOK</i>
<i>COULD JUSTIFY.</i>

371
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,326
<i>ONLY SHOCKNER'S</i>
<i>FLAT ALABASTER COMPLEXION</i>

372
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:33,263
<i>AND COLDNESS OF TOUCH</i>
<i>COULD HAVE EXPLAINED</i>
<i>WHAT I WAS FEELING.</i>

373
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:36,266
<i>AND EVEN THESE THINGS SHOULD</i>
<i>HAVE BEEN EXPLAINED AWAY,</i>

374
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:38,402
<i>BUT MY LOGIC WOULDN'T.</i>

375
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:40,304
<i>IT COULDN'T.</i>

376
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:44,608
<i>AND MY FEAR CUT RIGHT</i>
<i>THROUGH THE PAIN OF DYING.</i>

377
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,545
<i>MY REPUGNANCE</i>
<i>WAS SOON FORGOTTEN</i>

378
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:51,515
<i>AS I WAS SWALLOWED</i>
<i>INTO A PEACEFUL BLACKNESS.</i>

379
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:55,352
( electricity crackling )

380
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:59,189
<i>HONESTLY,</i>
<i>DESPITE MY IRRATIONAL FEAR,</i>

381
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,525
<i>I SHOULD HAVE BEEN</i>
<i>IN ADMIRATION</i>

382
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:03,527
<i>OF THE SURGEON'S GREAT SKILL.</i>

383
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,381
WHAT ARE YOU NOW?

384
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,189
Mrs. Hayward:
<i>STAY AWAY FROM MY</i>
<i>DAUGHTER, MR. BAXTER.</i>

385
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,493
Charlie:
<i>WHO AM I?</i>

386
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:38,395
<i>( distorted humming )</i>

387
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:26,410
<i>THE DOCTOR CLEARLY</i>
<i>UNDERSTOOD MY NEED</i>

388
00:32:26,412 --> 00:32:29,613
<i>AND ADMINISTERED TREATMENT</i>
<i>WITH A MASTER'S TOUCH,</i>

389
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:33,283
<i>ALL THE WHILE REASSURING ME</i>
<i>IN A FINELY MODULATED</i>

390
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,485
<i>THOUGH ODDLY DEAD</i>
<i>AND TONELESS VOICE</i>

391
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:39,089
<i>THAT THE DOCTOR WAS</i>
<i>THE SWORN ENEMY OF DEATH.</i>

392
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:41,224
<i>AND HORRORS ASIDE,</i>

393
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:44,461
<i>MY LIFE WAS SAVED.</i>

394
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,597
<i>( soft whirring )</i>

395
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,436
<i>WHEN I AWOKE</i>
<i>NINE HOURS LATER,</i>

396
00:32:52,438 --> 00:32:55,305
<i>I FOUND MYSELF</i>
<i>IN MY ROOM...</i>

397
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:59,109
<i>WITH DR. SHOCKNER.</i>

398
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,413
( weakly )
DOCTOR.

399
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:05,048
( groans )

400
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:07,551
( hoarsely )
I LIKED YOUR SCRIPT...

401
00:33:07,553 --> 00:33:10,320
ESPECIALLY ABOUT
THE MAD DOCTOR.

402
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:13,023
IT'S JUST A SCRIPT.

403
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:15,559
IT'S TRUE.
( clicks tongue )

404
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:18,395
I AM CONSIDERED
QUITE MAD BY MOST...

405
00:33:18,397 --> 00:33:21,498
( whispers )
ESPECIALLY OTHER DOCTORS.

406
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,268
WELL...

407
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,770
I'LL VOUCH FOR YOU.

408
00:33:26,772 --> 00:33:29,039
<i>( crows cawing )</i>

409
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:35,512
HOW DOES IT END,
YOUR SCRIPT?

410
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:40,584
I DON'T KNOW.

411
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:43,553
HAVE ANY IDEAS?

412
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:46,456
ANY IDEAS?

413
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:52,462
I AM ONE OF THOSE
WITH A COLD, CLINICAL MIND.

414
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:55,132
NO SENTIMENTALITY.

415
00:33:55,134 --> 00:33:57,401
SOUNDS LIKE AN AGENT.

416
00:33:57,403 --> 00:33:59,436
( chuckling )

417
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:06,610
DO YOU MIND GETTING
IDEAS FROM OTHERS?

418
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:10,047
NOT WHEN THEY'VE
SAVED MY LIFE.

419
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,185
ALL RIGHT THEN.

420
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,556
I THINK YOUR VILLAIN
NEEDS MORE HISTORY.

421
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,793
THE DOCTOR'S
NOT A VILLAIN.

422
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,395
REALLY?

423
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,432
IT READS
THAT WAY TO ME.

424
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:30,834
MISUNDERSTOOD.

425
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:36,373
<i>ANYWAY, IT'S JUST</i>
<i>A FIRST DRAFT.</i>

426
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:40,644
THERE'S ROOM
FOR CHANGE THEN?

427
00:34:40,646 --> 00:34:42,712
FOR THE STORY
OF THIS MAD DOCTOR

428
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:44,514
TO GO IN ANOTHER
DIRECTION?

429
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:46,616
SURE.

430
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:48,518
REWRITES.

431
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,487
( chuckles )
FUN.

432
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:52,456
( exhales )

433
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:56,159
WHAT DID YOU HAVE
IN MIND, DOCTOR?

434
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:59,329
AS I WAS SAYING,

435
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:01,832
THE DOCTOR NEEDS
MORE HISTORY.

436
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:05,235
SAY THIS DOCTOR,

437
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:07,437
WHO WAS BRILLIANT
BEYOND WORDS,

438
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:10,540
WAS SUDDENLY STRICKEN
WITH A RARE FATAL DISEASE.

439
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:13,577
SHE COULDN'T ACCEPT
IMPENDING DEATH SO--

440
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:15,545
"SHE"?

441
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:18,615
MY MAD DOCTOR IS MALE.

442
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,587
DID I SAY "SHE"?

443
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:26,156
I'M SORRY.

444
00:35:26,158 --> 00:35:27,557
I MEANT "HE."

445
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:31,528
BUT I LIKE
THE SEX CHANGE.

446
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:35,632
- <i>DO YOU?</i>
<i>- VERY MUCH.</i>

447
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:38,668
AS I SAID,
SHE COULDN'T ACCEPT DEATH.

448
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:43,440
SHE WAS
A GREAT SURGEON,

449
00:35:43,442 --> 00:35:45,175
A BRILLIANT SURGEON.

450
00:35:45,177 --> 00:35:48,545
SHE WAS A LIFE-GIVER
WHEN THERE WAS NO HOPE.

451
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:53,650
SHE HAD THE SKILLS
AND THE TALENTS OF GOD.

452
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:57,654
SO SHE WAS...

453
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,358
BIG INTO HER EGO AND...

454
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,160
SHE COULDN'T ACCEPT

455
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:05,929
NOT BEING ABLE
TO SAVE HER OWN LIFE,

456
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:08,632
HER OWN WORTHY LIFE,
WHEN SHE HAD SAVED

457
00:36:08,634 --> 00:36:10,800
SO MANY LESS VALUABLE,

458
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:12,736
MY OWN INCLUDED.

459
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:16,339
IN A SENSE, YES.

460
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:20,677
I LIKE IT.

461
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:26,783
SO THIS BRILLIANT DOCTOR
HAD TO SAVE HERSELF.

462
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:30,353
SHE KNEW SHE COULD DO IT
BEFORE TIME WAS OUT.

463
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,556
SHE SOON HAD SUNK
HER FORTUNE

464
00:36:32,558 --> 00:36:34,191
AND LOST ALL HER FRIENDS

465
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:35,859
IN A YEAR
OF BIZARRE EXPERIMENTS

466
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:37,794
DEVOTED TO CHEATING DEATH.

467
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:42,332
Charlie's voice:
<i>SOMETHING OF THE BENEVOLENT</i>
<i>FANATIC</i>

468
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:44,234
<i>SEEMED TO RESIDE</i>
<i>WITHIN HER,</i>

469
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:47,470
<i>AND SHE RAMBLED ON</i>
<i>ALMOST GARRULOUSLY.</i>

470
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:55,645
<i>EVIDENTLY SHE FOUND</i>
<i>THE SOCIETY OF A WELL-BORN,</i>

471
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:58,248
<i>WELL-EDUCATED WOMAN</i>
<i>A RARE NOVELTY</i>

472
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,717
<i>IN THIS SHALLOW WORLD</i>
<i>CALLED MALIBU,</i>

473
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:04,554
<i>AND WAS MOVED TO MEMORIES</i>
<i>OF BETTER DAYS</i>

474
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:08,725
<i>AT GRAND UNIVERSITIES</i>
<i>AND WORLD-RENOWNED</i>
<i>MEDICAL CLINICS.</i>

475
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:13,496
<i>HER VOICE, IF QUEER,</i>

476
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:15,498
<i>WAS AT LEAST SOOTHING.</i>

477
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:19,769
<i>SHE SOUGHT TO DISTRACT MY MIND</i>
<i>FROM MY OWN BRUSH WITH DEATH</i>

478
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:22,772
<i>BY SPEAKING OF HER THEORIES</i>
<i>AND EXPERIMENTS.</i>

479
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:26,476
<i>AND I REMEMBER</i>
<i>HER TACTFULLY CONSOLING ME</i>

480
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:28,478
<i>ABOUT MY WEAK HEART</i>

481
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,681
<i>BY INSISTING THAT</i>
<i>WILL AND CONSCIOUSNESS</i>

482
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:34,751
<i>ARE STRONGER</i>
<i>THAN ORGANIC LIFE ITSELF,</i>

483
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,655
<i>SO THAT IF A BODY IS</i>
<i>ESSENTIALLY HEALTHY</i>

484
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:41,258
<i>EXCEPT IN THE AREA</i>
<i>OF DISEASE,</i>

485
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,893
<i>AND THAT THE HEALTHY ORGANS</i>
<i>AND BONE AND TISSUE</i>

486
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:45,695
<i>ARE CAREFULLY PRESERVED,</i>

487
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:49,432
<i>IT MAY, THROUGH SCIENTIFIC</i>
<i>ENHANCEMENT,</i>

488
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,668
<i>RETAIN A KIND OF ANIMATION</i>

489
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:54,704
<i>DESPITE THE MOST SERIOUS</i>

<i>( heart beating )</i>

492
00:37:59,578 --> 00:38:03,413
<i>SHE MIGHT,</i>
<i>SHE HALF-JOKED,</i>

00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:05,682
<i>SOME DAY</i>
<i>TEACH ME TO LIVE--</i>

494
00:38:05,684 --> 00:38:09,486
<i>OR AT LEAST TO POSSESS</i>

<i>WITHOUT ANY HEART AT ALL.</i>

496

WHAT?

497
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:25,802
NO HEART AT ALL?

498
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:28,772
YOU MEAN...

499
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,508
WITH AN ARTIFICIAL HEART

500
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,511
OR SOME KIND

501
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:35,745
NO.

502
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:37,914

503
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:41,785

( guffaws )
REALLY?

513
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:18,922
I WASN'T AWARE THAT

<i>WITH A COMPLICATION</i>

00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,250
<i>UNTIL ONE DAY LAST AUGUST.</i>

662
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:03,352
<i>THE HORROR</i>
<i>OF HORRORS CAME</i>

663
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:05,321
<i>WITH SURPRISING</i>
<i>SUDDENNESS.</i>

664
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:08,825
<i>ON THAT HOT SUMMER DAY,</i>

665
00:47:08,827 --> 00:47:10,827
<i>THE AIR CONDITIONER</i>
<i>BROKE DOWN,</i>

666
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:13,996
<i>SO THAT WITHIN MINUTES</i>
<i>THE DOCTOR'S ROOM</i>

667
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:15,965
<i>HAD WARMED TO ABOVE 55°.</i>

668
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,334
( no dialogue )

669
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:24,006
<i>ESTELLA AND HER MOTHER</i>
<i>WERE OUTSIDE.</i>

670
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:27,109
<i>DR. SHOCKNER STAGGERED</i>
<i>DOWN THE STAIRS.</i>

671
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:31,280
<i>( crows cawing )</i>

672
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:25,434
<i>MRS. HAYWARD WORKED</i>
<i>DESPERATELY TO HELP HER UP,</i>

673
00:48:25,436 --> 00:48:28,371
<i>BUT SHE INSTEAD</i>
<i>PLEADED FOR ICE.</i>

674
00:48:28,373 --> 00:48:30,506
<i>MRS. HAYWARD DID</i>
<i>AS SHE WAS TOLD,</i>

675
00:48:30,508 --> 00:48:33,242
<i>RUNNING INTO THE KITCHEN</i>
<i>TO GET ALL THE ICE</i>
<i>IN THE FREEZER.</i>

676
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:35,645
<i>IT WAS THEN</i>
<i>THAT ESTELLA FOUND</i>

677
00:48:35,647 --> 00:48:37,346
<i>SOMETHING ON THE FLOOR.</i>

678
00:48:37,348 --> 00:48:40,016
<i>( thunder crashes )</i>

679
00:48:40,018 --> 00:48:42,351
<i>THE GOOD DOCTOR'S</i>
<i>INDEX FINGER.</i>

680
00:48:42,353 --> 00:48:45,388
<i>IT HAD ROTTED AND FALLEN OFF</i>
<i>IN THE STRUGGLE.</i>

681
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:50,226
<i>AS ESTELLA</i>
<i>CONTINUED HER TALE,</i>

682
00:48:50,228 --> 00:48:53,429
<i>IT'S CREEPY HORROR</i>
<i>WAS BEYOND BELIEF.</i>

683
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:01,304
<i>ESTELLA TOOK</i>
<i>THE FINGER OUT TO THE GARDEN</i>
<i>AND BURIED IT THERE.</i>

684
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:05,274
<i>SHE SAID SHE DID IT</i>
<i>BECAUSE A NEW ONE WOULD GROW</i>

685
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:07,977
<i>AND SHE WOULD SURPRISE</i>
<i>THE DOCTOR WITH HER CROP.</i>

686
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:18,654
<i>( fly buzzes )</i>

687
00:49:18,656 --> 00:49:20,723
( whirring )

688
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,462
DRINK.

689
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:29,465
ONE MORE QUESTION.

690
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:35,338
THOSE CUTS ON YOUR NECK,

691
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:39,241
- <i>THERE.</i>
<i>- UH, THE...</i>

692
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,678
THE DOCTOR.
YEAH, THE DOCTOR.  THE DOCTOR.

693
00:49:43,613 --> 00:49:45,481
WHY DID SHE DO IT?

694
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,650
YEAH, UH, MAMA MADE HER.

695
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:49,251
YEAH, MAMA MADE HER.  YEAH.

696
00:49:49,253 --> 00:49:52,421
MADE HER?  HOW?

697
00:49:52,423 --> 00:49:54,490
UH, MAMA SAID--

698
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:57,093
UH, MAMA SAID IF-IF--

699
00:49:57,095 --> 00:49:59,428
IF SHE DIDN'T FIX ME--

700
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:01,063
YEAH, IF SHE DIDN'T FIX ME,

701
00:50:01,065 --> 00:50:03,432
THAT-- UH, THAT-THAT--

702
00:50:03,434 --> 00:50:05,434
THAT SHE'D TELL ON HER.

703
00:50:05,436 --> 00:50:07,436
THE FIXING,

704
00:50:07,438 --> 00:50:10,039
SHE DID GOOD?

705
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:12,641
YEAH, UH, UH,

706
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:14,510
MAMA WANTS
MORE FIXING, YEAH.

707
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:16,445
MAMA WANTS MORE FIXING.

708
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,581
YEAH, SHE WANTS
MORE FIXING.

709
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,551
- BUT-BUT-- BUT THE-- BUT--
- <i>BUT WHAT?</i>

710
00:50:22,553 --> 00:50:24,653
UH, BUT THE, UH--

711
00:50:24,655 --> 00:50:27,590
THE DOCTOR--
THE DOCTOR SAYS IT'S, UH--

712
00:50:27,592 --> 00:50:29,792
IT'S-IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

713
00:50:29,794 --> 00:50:32,194
YEAH, IT'S JUST TOO--
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

714
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:33,295
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.  YEAH.

715
00:50:33,297 --> 00:50:35,464
SO THE FIXING STOPPED?

716
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:38,801
YEAH.  NO NO.

717
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:43,472
MAMA'S SAID--
MAMA SAID THAT--

718
00:50:43,474 --> 00:50:46,675
THAT-- THAT--

719
00:50:46,677 --> 00:50:49,111
THAT IF-IF--

720
00:50:49,113 --> 00:50:52,314
IF THE FIXING
DIDN'T KEEP ON, THEN--

721
00:50:52,316 --> 00:50:54,183
THEN SHE WOULD...

722
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:57,520
<i>SHE WOULD DESTROY</i>
<i>HER MACHINE AND-AND--</i>

723
00:50:57,522 --> 00:50:59,755
AND THAT SHE WOULD--
SHE WOULD BURN IN HELL.

724
00:50:59,757 --> 00:51:01,490
YEAH, BURN IN HELL.
BURN IN HELL.

725
00:51:01,492 --> 00:51:02,792
YEAH, LET HER
JUST BURN IN HELL.

726
00:51:02,794 --> 00:51:04,493
( stammers )

727
00:51:04,495 --> 00:51:06,662
AND THAT SHE KNEW
WHAT SHE WAS.  YEAH.

728
00:51:06,664 --> 00:51:08,397
AND THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.

729
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:10,199
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT SHE--
SHE WAS VERY MAD.

730
00:51:10,201 --> 00:51:11,767
SHE WAS-- SHE VERY MAD.
YEAH, UH-HUH.

731
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:15,504
- YEAH, SHE WAS MAD
WHEN SHE SAID THAT.
- SO IS SHE STILL FIXING?

732
00:51:15,506 --> 00:51:17,840
<i>YEAH...</i>

733
00:51:17,842 --> 00:51:19,575
OH YEAH.

734
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:21,744
( grunts )

735
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:24,447
MY COMPLIMENTS
TO THE CHEF.

736
00:51:24,449 --> 00:51:27,316
PICK UP THE TRAY,
ESTELLA.

737
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:29,085
LET'S GO.

738
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,559
I-- I-- I--

739
00:51:36,561 --> 00:51:38,594
I LIKED
THE QUESTION-ANSWER GAME.

740
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:40,663
- ESTELLA!
- YEAH, OKAY.

741
00:51:57,547 --> 00:52:01,317
- ( grunting )
- <i>( knocks on door )</i>

742
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,627
YOU-- YOU OKAY?

743
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:15,731
<i>( chair clatters )</i>

744
00:52:15,733 --> 00:52:17,600
I HEARD YOU WERE SICK.

745
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:22,805
DID THE DOCTOR
TREAT YOU?

746
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:25,407
( breathing heavily )

747
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:32,915
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

748
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:37,853
IT'S NOT FAIR.

749
00:52:37,855 --> 00:52:41,323
( crying )
I WAS PROMISED.

750
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:43,659
I PAID MY... DEPOSIT.

751
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:46,595
- DEPOSIT FOR WHAT?
- I WAS PATIENT.

752
00:52:46,597 --> 00:52:49,498
- IT WAS MY TURN.
- TURN FOR WHAT?

753
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,667
THE DOCTOR'S METHOD!
YOU--

754
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:56,605
LOOK...

755
00:52:56,607 --> 00:52:59,441
I KEPT HER PRESERVED

756
00:52:59,443 --> 00:53:02,211
DOWN IN THE STORAGE ROOM,

757
00:53:02,213 --> 00:53:03,812
IN THE FREEZER.

758
00:53:03,814 --> 00:53:06,749
SHE'S THERE, WAITING.

759
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:09,418
I'M NOT INVOLVED.

760
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,420
I PAID

761
00:53:11,422 --> 00:53:14,456
EVERY LAST PENNY I HAD

762
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:17,693
TO MRS. HAYWARD AND THE DOCTOR
TO BRING HER BACK!

763
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:20,930
- BRING WHO BACK?
- MY WIFE.

764
00:53:20,932 --> 00:53:24,366
- WIFE?
- YES, MY WIFE!

765
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:26,669
SHE LIVED HERE WITH ME...

766
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:31,640
BEFORE I KILLED HER.

767
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:41,517
I WAS DRUNK.

768
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,587
WE WEREN'T GETTING ALONG.

769
00:53:44,589 --> 00:53:46,789
( cries )
I KILLED HER.

770
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:52,628
I STABBED HER
TO DEATH.

771
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:56,732
BUT I LOVED HER.

772
00:53:58,668 --> 00:54:00,736
I STILL DO.

773
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:02,972
AND I MISS HER

774
00:54:02,974 --> 00:54:05,274
AND I WANT HER BACK.

775
00:54:05,276 --> 00:54:06,809
( sobbing )

776
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:23,993
BUT SHE'S DEAD.

777
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:27,563
SHE'S FROZEN...

778
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:30,599
IN MRS. HAYWARD'S FREEZER.

779
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:33,702
Charlie's voice:
<i>DELTOID SPUN A TALE</i>

780
00:54:33,704 --> 00:54:36,405
<i>MORE HORRIBLE</i>
<i>WITH EACH SENTENCE.</i>

781
00:54:36,407 --> 00:54:39,675
<i>HE AND HIS WIFE HAD</i>
<i>MOVED IN SIX MONTHS AGO.</i>

782
00:54:39,677 --> 00:54:43,612
<i>THEIR LIVES HAD TAKEN</i>
<i>A DEEP, DARK DIVE.</i>

783
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:46,749
<i>THERE WAS BLAMING</i>
<i>AND FIGHTING.</i>

784
00:54:46,751 --> 00:54:48,817
<i>THERE WAS LIQUOR.</i>

785
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:51,720
<i>THEN IT ALL</i>
<i>BLEW UP ONE NIGHT</i>

786
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:53,822
<i>AND DELTOID TOOK</i>
<i>HIS DRAWING PEN</i>

787
00:54:53,824 --> 00:54:56,759
<i>AND DROVE IT</i>
<i>INTO HIS WIFE'S THROAT.</i>

788
00:54:58,428 --> 00:54:59,895
<i>HE RAN TO MRS. HAYWARD</i>

789
00:54:59,897 --> 00:55:01,930
<i>AND WANTED HER</i>
<i>TO CALL THE POLICE.</i>

790
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:05,000
<i>TO HIS SURPRISE,</i>
<i>MRS. HAYWARD OFFERED</i>

791
00:55:05,002 --> 00:55:07,770
<i>AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT</i>
<i>COURSE OF ACTION.</i>

792
00:55:07,772 --> 00:55:10,639
<i>IF DELTOID WOULD</i>
<i>PAY HER DOUBLE HIS RENT</i>

793
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:12,941
<i>AND KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT,</i>

794
00:55:12,943 --> 00:55:16,812
<i>SHE WOULD SEE</i>
<i>IF THE DOCTOR WOULD BRING</i>
<i>HIS WIFE BACK TO LIFE.</i>

795
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:21,483
<i>SHE EXPLAINED</i>
<i>TO THIS DESPERATE</i>
<i>AND DISTRAUGHT MAN</i>

796
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,752
<i>THAT THE DOCTOR HAD</i>
<i>DONE THIS ONCE BEFORE</i>

797
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:26,055
<i>AND SHE HAD GREAT SKILL.</i>

798
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:30,859
<i>MRS. HAYWARD SAID THIS</i>
<i>TO A BROKEN MAN,</i>

799
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:35,631
<i>A MAN THAT WAS EASY PREY</i>
<i>FOR HER WILD SCHEME.</i>

800
00:55:35,633 --> 00:55:39,735
<i>SO BOLSTERED BY</i>
<i>THIS HOPE OF UNDOING</i>
<i>HIS HEINOUS ATROCITY,</i>

801
00:55:39,737 --> 00:55:42,538
<i>SHE AND DELTOID PUT</i>
<i>HIS WIFE IN THE FREEZER,</i>

802
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,707
<i>BESIDE THE OTHER</i>
<i>FROZEN MEAT.</i>

803
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:48,677
<i>SHE TOLD DELTOID</i>
<i>HE HAD TO BE PATIENT,</i>

804
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:52,781
<i>THAT THE DOCTOR WOULD GET</i>
<i>TO HIS WIFE IN TIME.</i>

805
00:55:52,783 --> 00:55:54,917
<i>SHE WOULD BE NEXT.</i>

806
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:57,853
WHAT DO I DO?

807
00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:03,859
HOPE.

808
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:09,398
HOPE?

809
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:14,870
( laughing )

810
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,541
HOPE.

811
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:24,880
NOW THERE'S A GOOD WORD.

812
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:41,430
Charlie's voice:
<i>NO ONE EVER SAW</i>
<i>ARNOLD DELTOID ALIVE AGAIN.</i>

813
00:56:41,432 --> 00:56:45,033
<i>WHEN HE CAME TO BE MISSED--</i>
<i>AND THIS WOULD TAKE WEEKS--</i>

814
00:56:45,035 --> 00:56:46,835
<i>ESTELLA WOULD FIND HIM</i>

815
00:56:46,837 --> 00:56:49,104
<i>LYING IN THE FREEZER</i>
<i>WITH HIS DEAD WIFE.</i>

816
00:56:49,106 --> 00:56:50,873
<i>HE SLIT HIS WRISTS</i>

817
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:53,909
<i>AND WRAPPED HIS BLOODY PAWS</i>
<i>AROUND HIS LOVING WIFE.</i>

818
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:08,590
<i>THERE WAS AN INCREASING</i>
<i>AND UNEXPLAINED ATMOSPHERE</i>

819
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:11,693
<i>OF EVIL AND HORROR</i>
<i>THAT SEEMED TO RISE</i>
<i>AROUND THE HAYWARD HOUSE.</i>

820
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:14,863
<i>THE WHOLE HOUSE,</i>
<i>AS I'VE SAID,</i>

821
00:57:14,865 --> 00:57:16,865
<i>HAD A MUSTY ODOR.</i>

822
00:57:16,867 --> 00:57:19,868
<i>BUT THE SMELL</i>
<i>THIS DAY WAS WORSE.</i>

823
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:22,938
<i>AND IN SPITE OF ALL</i>
<i>THE DEODORIZER AND INCENSE,</i>

824
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,674
<i>AND THE PUNGENT</i>
<i>CLEANING CHEMICALS,</i>

825
00:57:25,676 --> 00:57:28,944
<i>IT WOULD BE A SMELL</i>
<i>THAT WOULD NEVER BE MASKED.</i>

826
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:34,983
<i>FIENDISH THINGS WERE</i>
<i>IN THE AIR.</i>

827
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:39,655
<i>SO STRONG WAS</i>
<i>THE PUNGENT PRESENCE OF EVIL</i>

828
00:57:39,657 --> 00:57:41,890
<i>THAT BELIEVERS</i>
<i>WOULD BE REACHING WILDLY</i>

829
00:57:41,892 --> 00:57:44,059
<i>FOR THE BEADS</i>
<i>OF THEIR ROSARIES.</i>

830
00:57:44,061 --> 00:57:47,095
<i>A LESS ADVENTURESOME SOUL</i>
<i>WOULD HAVE LONG FLED,</i>

831
00:57:47,097 --> 00:57:48,931
<i>SCREAMING AND MAD-EYED.</i>

832
00:57:48,933 --> 00:57:51,900
<i>THERE WAS NO SOUND</i>
<i>WITHIN THE GREAT HOUSE,</i>

833
00:57:51,902 --> 00:57:56,839
<i>EXCEPT A NAMELESS</i>
<i>SORT OF SLOW, THICK DRIPPING.</i>

834
00:57:57,907 --> 00:58:00,576
<i>( door opens )</i>

835
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:15,824
<i>THE SOUNDS WERE</i>
<i>OF UTTER TURMOIL.</i>

836
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:19,261
<i>AND ABOVE THE CLATTERING</i>
<i>AND SLAMMING OF ODD VOICES,</i>

837
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:22,264
<i>I HEARD A WOMAN PRAYING</i>
<i>IN A DESPERATE PLEA.</i>

838
00:58:22,266 --> 00:58:24,233
<i>IT WAS THE DOCTOR.</i>

839
00:58:24,235 --> 00:58:26,668
<i>WE COULD HEAR</i>
<i>A WILD THRASHING</i>

840
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:27,836
<i>WITHIN THE DOCTOR'S ROOM</i>

841
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:29,972
<i>AND A HYSTERICAL VOICE</i>
<i>CROAKING,</i>

842
00:58:29,974 --> 00:58:32,674
<i>"THE COLD.  THE COLD."</i>

843
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:36,245
- <i>( Shockner moaning )</i>
<i>- HER AIR CONDITIONING FAILED.</i>

844
00:58:36,247 --> 00:58:39,748
SHE NEEDS HELP!
LISTEN TO HER!

845
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:41,850
IT'S A PITY.

846
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,687
Charlie's voice:
<i>AS I TRIED TO WALK,</i>

847
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:48,857
<i>I WAS SUDDENLY AWARE</i>
<i>OF HOW WARM IT WAS</i>
<i>IN THE HALL.</i>

848
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:50,692
<i>IT MADE ME DIZZY AND WEAK</i>

849
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:52,828
<i>AND SICK TO MY STOMACH.</i>

850
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:55,297
<i>I NEEDED THE COLD.</i>

851
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:02,204
<i>THE DOCTOR'S</i>
<i>RAGE AND FEAR,</i>

852
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:04,740
<i>SWELLING</i>
<i>TO GROTESQUE PROPORTIONS,</i>

853
00:59:04,742 --> 00:59:08,610
<i>SEEMED LIKELY</i>
<i>TO SHATTER WHAT REMAINED</i>
<i>OF HER FAILING PHYSIQUE.</i>

854
00:59:08,612 --> 00:59:11,013
<i>AND ONCE A SPASM CAUSED HER</i>
<i>TO CLAP HER HANDS</i>

855
00:59:11,015 --> 00:59:13,215
<i>TO HER EYES</i>
<i>TO SHIELD THEM...</i>

856
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:15,717
<i>OR KEEP THEM</i>
<i>FROM FALLING OUT.</i>

857
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:19,187
<i>SHE GROPED HER WAY</i>
<i>DOWN THE HALL TOWARD ME</i>

858
00:59:19,189 --> 00:59:21,123
<i>AS IF BLIND</i>
<i>FOR THE FIRST TIME.</i>

859
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:25,794
<i>THE DOCTOR'S STENCH</i>
<i>WAS OVER-POWERING.</i>

860
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:29,097
<i>IT WAS SO STRONG</i>
<i>AS TO SUCK THE OXYGEN</i>

861
00:59:29,099 --> 00:59:30,732
<i>OUT OF THE AIR.</i>

862
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:33,235
<i>I FELT SUFFOCATED</i>
<i>AND SMOTHERED BY IT.</i>

863
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,805
<i>AGAINST ALL</i>
<i>MY SCREAMING INSTINCTS,</i>

864
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,808
<i>I REACHED OUT</i>
<i>TO THIS POOR WOMAN.</i>

865
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:44,680
( labored breathing )

866
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:19,648
<i>AS THE MINUTES PASSED</i>

867
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:22,050
<i>I OBSERVED WITH REGRET</i>
<i>THAT MY NEW FRIEND</i>

868
01:00:22,052 --> 01:00:25,053
<i>WAS INDEED SLOWLY,</i>
<i>BUT UNMISTAKABLY</i>

869
01:00:25,055 --> 01:00:27,189
<i>LOOSING GROUND</i>
<i>PHYSICALLY.</i>

870
01:00:27,191 --> 01:00:30,959
<i>THE LIVID ASPECT</i>
<i>OF HER BEING WAS INTENSIFIED.</i>

871
01:00:30,961 --> 01:00:34,696
<i>HER VOICE BECAME</i>
<i>MORE HOLLOW AND INDISTINCT.</i>

872
01:00:34,698 --> 01:00:38,300
<i>HER GRACEFUL MOTIONS WERE</i>
<i>LESS PERFECTLY COORDINATED.</i>

873
01:00:38,302 --> 01:00:40,268
<i>AND HER MIND AND WILL</i>

874
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:43,672
<i>DISPLAYED LESS RESILIENCE</i>
<i>AND INITIATIVE.</i>

875
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,809
( hoarsely )
DO I DISGUST YOU?

876
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:52,114
- NO.
- <i>SHE WAS AWARE</i>
<i>OF THIS SAD CHANGE</i>

877
01:00:52,116 --> 01:00:54,883
<i>AND LITTLE BY LITTLE</i>
<i>HER EXPRESSION AND CONVERSATION</i>

878
01:00:54,885 --> 01:00:58,320
<i>BOTH TOOK ON A GRUESOME IRONY</i>
<i>WHICH RESTORED IN ME...</i>

879
01:00:58,322 --> 01:01:00,155
NOT EXACTLY.

880
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:02,190
<i>...SOMETHING</i>
<i>OF THE SUBTLE REPULSION</i>

881
01:01:02,192 --> 01:01:04,059
<i>I HAD ORIGINALLY FELT.</i>

882
01:01:04,061 --> 01:01:06,662
MMM.  IT'S THE SMELL.

883
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:10,666
NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT.

884
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:22,711
I WAS BEAUTIFUL.

885
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,447
I CAN SEE THAT.

886
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:32,888
- ( sizzling )
- ( labored breathing )

887
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,360
IT'S...

888
01:01:39,796 --> 01:01:41,396
IT'S TIME FOR--

889
01:01:41,398 --> 01:01:44,199
FOR YOU TO TAKE
YOUR MEDS.

890
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:52,174
YOU HAVE A CHOICE,
CHARLIE.

891
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:56,344
A CHOICE?

892
01:01:59,348 --> 01:02:01,483
A CHOICE.

893
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:06,154
ONE I DID NOT HAVE.

894
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,492
TELL ME
ABOUT MY CHOICE...

895
01:02:11,794 --> 01:02:13,295
AND YOURS.

896
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:22,904
Charlie's voice:
<i>I LISTENED, ADDICTED</i>
<i>TO HER EVERY WORD.</i>

897
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:24,740
<i>( Shockner speaking )</i>

898
01:02:24,742 --> 01:02:26,908
Charlie's voice:
<i>SHE TOLD OF SECRET RESEARCHES</i>

899
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,744
<i>AND ALMOST GHASTLY RESULTS.</i>

900
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:32,481
<i>IT SEEMS THAT SHE DID NOT</i>
<i>SCORN THE INCANTATIONS</i>

901
01:02:32,483 --> 01:02:34,249
<i>OF THE WITCHES</i>
<i>AND THE BLACK ARTS</i>

902
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:36,918
<i>WITH REGARD</i>
<i>TO LIFE AND DEATH,</i>

903
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,054
<i>SINCE SHE BELIEVED</i>
<i>THESE CRYPTIC ARTS</i>

904
01:02:39,056 --> 01:02:41,256
<i>CONTAINED RARE</i>
<i>PSYCHOLOGICAL STIMULI</i>

905
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:43,925
<i>WHICH MIGHT CONCEIVABLY</i>
<i>HAVE HEALING EFFECTS</i>

906
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:47,295
<i>ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM</i>
<i>IN WHICH ORGANIC LIFE HAD DIED.</i>

907
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:54,936
<i>I WAS MOVED BY HER ACCOUNT</i>
<i>OF THE AGED DR. TORRES</i>
<i>OF VALENCIA, SPAIN,</i>

908
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:57,939
<i>WHO HAD SHARED</i>
<i>HIS EARLIER EXPERIMENTS</i>

909
01:02:57,941 --> 01:03:00,342
<i>AND NURSED DR. SHOCKNER</i>
<i>THROUGH A GREAT ILLNESS</i>

<i>18 YEARS BEFORE,</i>

911
01:03:02,212 --> 01:03:04,880
<i>AND WHERE HER</i>
<i>PRESENT DISORDERS BEGAN.</i>

912
01:03:04,882 --> 01:03:06,314
...BEYOND MY TIME...

913
01:03:06,316 --> 01:03:09,217
<i>NO SOONER HAD</i>
<i>DR. TORRES SAVE HIS COLLEAGUE</i>

914
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:13,388
<i>THAT HE HIMSELF DIED</i>
<i>A GRIM DEATH IN A FIRE.</i>

915
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:16,158
<i>THE DOCTOR MADE IT</i>
<i>WHISPERINGLY CLEAR--</i>

916
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,160
<i>THOUGH NOT IN DETAIL--</i>

917
01:03:18,162 --> 01:03:20,796
<i>THAT THE METHODS</i>
<i>TORRES USED TO HEAL</i>

918
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:23,865
<i>HAD EXTRAORDINARY</i>
<i>INVOLVING TECHNIQUES</i>

919
01:03:23,867 --> 01:03:25,834
<i>AND PROCESSES NOT WELCOMED</i>

920
01:03:25,836 --> 01:03:27,969
<i>BY THE CONSERVATIVE WORLD</i>
<i>OF MODERN MEDICINE.</i>

921

( coughing )

922
01:03:29,506 --> 01:03:33,809
- MRS. HAYWARD!  HELP!
- <i>...FOR HER TO CALL</i>

- ( coughing continues )
- WE NEED HELP!

926
01:03:40,117 --> 01:03:42,984
<i>A KIND OF GROWING HORROR</i>

CHARLIE!

928
01:03:44,855 --> 01:03:46,555
<i>SHE TALKED</i>
<i>ABOUT DEATH INCESSANTLY,</i>

929
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:49,157
<i>BUT LAUGHED HOLLOWLY</i>

930

<i>AT SUCH THINGS AS BURIAL</i>
<i>OR FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS.</i>

931

- YOU NEED HELP.
- ( labored breathing )

932
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:56,498
YOU NEED HELP.
LET ME CALL THE PARAMEDICS.

933
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,468
<i>THERE WAS SOME BITTER IRONY</i>
<i>IN THOSE MATTERS.</i>

934

<i>ALL IN ALL,</i>

- <i>AND EVEN GRUESOME</i>
<i>COMPANION.</i>
<i>- PLEASE.</i>

936
01:04:09,613 --> 01:04:12,047
<i>YET MY GRATITUDE</i>
<i>FOR HER SAVING MY LIFE</i>

937
01:04:12,049 --> 01:04:14,216
<i>MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE</i>
<i>TO ABANDON HER.</i>

938
01:04:14,218 --> 01:04:15,417
OKAY.

939
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:21,323

940
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:32,400
