1
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,038
"Here lies the body of Joshua Winthrop.

2
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,238
"Died October 7th 1 704." Hmm.

3
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,996
She's in shock.

4
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,031
Get her over to Essex General.
Dr Samuelson Will be Waiting for you.

5
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,678
- Carter, Where's Tanya?
- Tanya's going to the hospital.

6
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,911
- Is she going to be all right?
- Yes, she Will.

7
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,073
HoWard, I need you to take this.
Don't let anyone see it.

8
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,355
- You're kidding me.
- Just do it.

9
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,668
OK.

10
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,070
HoWard, What did you see in the house?

11
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,438
Oh, Carter, it Was horrible.
It Wasn't human.

12
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,429
- You're going to be all right.
- OK.

13
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,876
Put it right doWn here.

14
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,954
Well, Doc?

15
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,875
Whatever did this Was using big teeth
or some sort of tool.

16
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,838
Been dead about four hours, I'd guess.

17
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,551
I don't knoW about this one -
he hasn't got a head.

18
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,110
- Did you check on the attic?
- You gotta be kidding me.

19
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,676
There's nothing there. No sign of the girl.

20
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,514
Whatever Was living in there
must have been real strange.

21
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:00,277
The head's in there, along With
What appear to be human bones.

22
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,275
- Arnie, this is no single night's Work.
- Any signs of the killer?

23
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,717
- There's signs of something, sir.
- Arnie? I gotta talk to you.

24
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,519
- Yeah, sure.
- Look.

25
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,831
I think We've got another one
of those incidents.

26
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,434
You're telling me What I don't Wanna hear.

27
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,354
These Wounds aren't anything
like a dog or a Wolf could do.

28
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,476
Damn this toWn.

29
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,599
Remember the DunWich thing?
This may be something similar.

30
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,753
- We couldn't go through that again.
- I can't help it, Arnie.

31
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,310
It's got to be contained. You knoW that.

32
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,155
Then you accept responsibility
if Whatever did this strikes again.

33
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,196
And you knoW that.

34
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,556
Yeah, I knoW.

35
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,598
God help us.

36
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,070
All right. Let's get a move on!

37
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,949
- What's your name again?
- Carter. Randolph Carter.

38
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,033
Malcolm, drive Mr Randolph Carter
to the station, please.

39
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,193
- Would you like a statement?
- Not noW. Just go With the officer.

40
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,070
Malcolm.
Keep him busy until I get doWn there.

41
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,118
I don't Want him talking
to anyone but you. You got that?

42
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,953
- Yeah. What's going on?
- Just do it, please.

43
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,959
- Debbie? Secure the house.
- Yes, sir.

44
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,473
Ben?

45
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,994
Sir?

46
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,598
I Want you to sit out on the highWay
and I don't Want anyone near this place.

47
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,636
Yes, sir.

48
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,790
Jesus.

49
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,630
- Psst.
- Hey.

50
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,553
- HoW are you doing, HoWard?
- Better.

51
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,837
The cuts Were pretty bad but the fever's
doWn.

52
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,151
For a While they thought
I might have rabies.

53
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,755
- Have they talked to you?
- Yes. I just got out of there.

54
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,276
- They think this is going to bloW over.
- It is over.

55
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,590
Over? Do you knoW What you found?

56
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,398
Jesus, Carter, look at me!

57
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,439
This could be an important discovery.
You saW this creature?

58
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,559
- Yeah. I saW it up close and personal.
- Right.

59
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,191
Do you knoW What I saW? Tunnels under
the graveyard. No dog made those.

60
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,840
- You think the creature did it?
- Exactly.

61
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,229
Do you have the book?

62
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,959
You should have turned it over to the police.

63
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,350
- No.
- What are you gonna do?

64
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,399
Study the Necronomicon,
then go back into those tunnels.

65
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,995
- Don't do that, Carter.
- HoWard, listen to me.

66
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,198
You Were lucky. The others Weren't.
This isn't a story any more.

67
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,077
This is pure fact. Think about it.

68
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,355
I don't Want to think about it.

69
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,396
Don't you understand?

70
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,393
For centuries people have ridiculed
Arkham for living in fear of this.

71
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,438
It doesn't matter any more. It's gone.

72
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,913
Perhaps. Maybe you're right.
It is gone. Get some rest.

73
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,436
I Wish I could.
I've been having these nightmares.

74
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,479
- Hm. I'll come back later today.
- OK.

75
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,838
You told the police
about the tunnels, didn't you? Carter?

76
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,715
He didn't tell them.

77
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,188
Hey, Carter! Open up.
Carter, did you hear about HoWard?

78
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,515
Hey, Carter, you in there?

79
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,070
- Hey, Carter, it's me - Barger.
- I've a lot of Work to do.

80
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,072
We're your friends. You're gonna
go squirly Working like this.

81
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,596
- I'm fine.
- Work, Work, Work.

82
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,956
Carter, it's Saturday
and We've got neWs for you.

83
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,110
I'm busy and I'd appreciate it if...

84
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,715
Carter, you've gotta get off
of this overachieving thing.

85
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,314
We're going to the union for breakfast.

86
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,110
Everybody is talking about What
happened at the old Winthrop place.

87
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,432
Hey, these used to be
the old housemaster's rooms.

88
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,069
- Yes. If you Wouldn't mind...
- I heard HoWard Was there.

89
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,071
Said he's torn up.

90
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,075
Yes. I saW him about an hour ago.

91
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,950
The radio said HoWard and five other
students Were attacked by Wild dogs.

92
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,156
- That isn't true.
- That's the story.

93
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,631
HoWard should be back in a day or so
and he can tell you about it then.

94
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,269
- Carter, are you studying physics?
- No. Why?

95
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,352
This stuff on the board here.

96
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,477
Hieroglyphics. I'm trying to translate them.

97
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,437
It's some kind of equation.

98
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,758
It's a formula for quantum mechanics.
This is heavy stuff for a folklore major.

99
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,796
Great. Let's go eat.

100
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,233
Really?

101
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,949
Radical slant.
I don't see hoW you got this figure.

102
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,396
Oh, I didn't.
What do you mean by "radical"?

103
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,711
This line is fine - it deals With time -
but this...

104
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,432
Come on, Barger. We're not here to bull
about business. Mary's Waiting for me.

105
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,795
Quantum physics is a neW theory?

106
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,793
Planck came up With the basics
around 1900, but it's still a theory.

107
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,509
This is getting just
a little too deep for me, guys.

108
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,033
Ta-ta.

109
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,915
Barger, hoW does this Work?

110
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,916
Aaagh!

111
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:39,875
'What you have unleashed
by entering my home is again leashed.'

112
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,439
What?

113
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,911
No, you're not dreaming,
but you are in grave danger.

114
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,118
What you have unleashed still lives.
BeWare.

115
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,115
My poWers in death
are much less than they Were in life

116
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,749
and I can only hold
that portion of the demon...

117
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,473
Which is my beloved daughter, Alyda.

118
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,028
I'm definitely dreaming.

119
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,398
Within her is a demon I summoned -
God forgive me! -

120
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,199
and I cannot send it back.

121
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,670
Pages I cannot find... Those pages...

122
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,033
But beWare - it Will destroy you
and destroy this World.

123
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,674
You must destroy it.

124
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,752
I cannot. It is my daughter...

125
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,916
and again it's not my daughter.

126
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,276
But that Which is my daughter I cannot kill.

127
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,354
You must destroy it. I cannot.

128
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,110
I... No... This isn't real.

129
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,270
I'm dreaming. I'm...

130
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,276
I'm not dreaming.

131
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,193
All right, HoWard. I believe you.
Just don't fall asleep.

132
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,913
Yes.

133
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,958
Yes. They're my students. I'll deal With it.

134
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,076
Hello, Amelia.

135
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,357
- 'Chancellor Thayer, Carter is here.'
- I see him. Thank you.

136
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,549
- Sit doWn, Carter.
- No, thank you, Chancellor Thayer.

137
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,354
Last night, four of your students died.

138
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,635
Yes, I knoW that.

139
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,315
They Weren't killed by Wild dogs
as the police claim.

140
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,951
I knoW this sounds ludicrous, but they Were
killed by a 300-year-old creature

141
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,077
and if We don't do something fast,
no one Will believe us.

142
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,914
This is Arkham, Carter,
not NeW York, not Boston.

143
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,595
That's Why We have to expose this thing.

144
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,708
This "thing"? This mythical "thing"?

145
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,799
- You've seen it With your oWn eyes?
- No.

146
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,670
You've touched it? You can sWear
on your life that it isn't a hoax?

147
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,355
- I can't, but...
- Yes.

148
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,876
Four students have died,
but We have no proof Who did it.

149
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,909
It could be a raving lunatic and yet
you're ready to go public With some tale

150
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,709
about a 300-year-old creature
living in an attic.

151
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,389
I greW up in Arkham, Carter.
I knoW the story.

152
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,631
I've also read your statement
and the police report.

153
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,029
We've enough trouble With four deaths.

154
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,430
If you add Witchcraft, Satanism
and a demon from hell

155
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,795
We're going to have a media circus.

156
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,270
Are you ready to bring all that
on this toWn and university?

157
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,999
Yes, sir. We have to face it.

158
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,755
You're a brilliant student, Carter,
but you're a fool.

159
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,628
Nobody's going to believe you.
Nobody's going to help you.

160
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,554
You knoW about this.
You knoW about that place.

161
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,110
You have no idea
What forces you've stumbled on.

162
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,158
- And you do?
- I don't stumble on them.

163
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,074
I respect them and leave them alone,
and so does everybody else.

164
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,675
Ignorance.
Damn stupid 1 7th-century ignorance.

165
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,399
That's What's Wrong
With you and this toWn.

166
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,390
This toWn Was cursed
long before the 1 7th century

167
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,029
and there isn't anything
you or I can do to change that.

168
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,351
If you pursue this,
you'll end up like your friends.

169
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,116
Yes, sir.

170
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,199
- Have you seen Professor Warren?
- Upstairs reading room.

171
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,755
- Professor Warren.
- Oh, hello, Carter. Do sit doWn.

172
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,154
- I have to talk to you.
- What have you got there?

173
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,073
Before I shoW you this...

174
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:45,076
The old Joshua Winthrop house by the
cemetery. What do you knoW about it?

175
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,993
Ha. Quite a lot, actually.

176
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,794
The place has a most dismal reputation.

177
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,316
As a matter of fact
I collected some tales about it.

178
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:00,633
There Was one about...
an image seen in an attic WindoW.

179
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,475
Another one about a young man
Who Was chased by a horned creature.

180
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,553
And there Was the most
extraordinary business in 1 842 or '43...

181
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,633
Yes. I've read them.
But have you ever been out there?

182
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,872
Good heavens, no.
I'm a scholar. I'm not a field man.

183
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,397
Besides, the locale is not
terribly important in oral history.

184
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,675
If you haven't been there, hoW do you knoW?

185
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:30,390
My dear Carter, you're not implying there
might be some substance to these tales?

186
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,634
Yes, I am. I didn't see it personally,
but Eliot Damon HoWard did.

187
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,439
He claims to have seen
the creature of the legends.

188
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,559
I Would need something
more substantial to corroborate that.

189
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,630
The Necronomicon of Abdul Alhazred.

190
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,869
My dear chap, do you knoW What this is?

191
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,155
Have you any idea? Where did you find it?

192
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,071
In the Winthrop house.

193
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,953
Oh...

194
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,913
This is the original Arabic text.

195
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,834
There hasn't been one of these extant
since the Cotton Mather one.

196
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,878
- And that disappeared in...
- 1688.

197
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,188
1688.

198
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,910
This, Professor, is the same copy.
I'd hate to calculate the fines due on it.

199
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,070
You're absolutely right. It is.

200
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,754
There are the missing pages.

201
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,152
Cotton Mather didn't even entrust
the university With the complete copy.

202
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,994
- Who did the annotations?
- Oh, probably Mather.

203
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,959
- I've no idea Who did the English.
- Joshua Winthrop?

204
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,110
Yes, possibly Winthrop.

205
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,273
He must have borroWed the book
and it Was never returned.

206
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:01,230
I believe Joshua Winthrop created the
creature of these legends using this book.

207
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,753
Yes.

208
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,117
Yes, it is possible.

209
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,671
That's Why We have to go there.
We have to find this thing and prove it's real.

210
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,716
Wait a minute, Carter.

211
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,713
If this thing is alive,
it could be very dangerous.

212
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,315
Something happened
at the Winthrop house last night.

213
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,597
Four Miskatonic University students
Were killed.

214
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,274
They Were killed, I believe, by this creature.

215
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,590
Good heavens.

216
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,873
But it Would be most improper
to interfere With the police investigation.

217
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,350
- So We should turn this over to them?
- Are you mad?!

218
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,998
Sshh!

219
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,992
Have you any idea of the damage
that could result

220
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,674
if this book fell into the Wrong hands?

221
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,639
No, no, no. It must be locked up safe
in the university vaults

222
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,518
and kept aWay
from the prying eyes of the public.

223
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:59,358
It should be entrusted only in the hands
of scholars of...integrity and probity.

224
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,590
You are the most qualified scholar I knoW

225
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,116
and I need your help
to confront this beast.

226
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,799
- Aagh!
- HoWard. HoWard, Wake up. Wake up.

227
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,919
- The last thing you need to do is sleep.
- Every time I doze off...

228
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,434
- It's time.
- We have to convince the police.

229
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,557
- Forget it. We can't trust anyone noW.
- Then What?

230
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,757
- Are you Well enough to travel?
- You're not going back?

231
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,638
Get dressed. I brought you some clothes.

232
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,479
Every time I fall asleep, there she is...
it is...just Waiting for me.

233
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,351
I just manage to Wake up
before she can...

234
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,510
Before she can What?

235
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,513
I don't knoW, l... I don't knoW.

236
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:56,831
Turn here. We can't go in by the path.
There'll be a police car parked up there.

237
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,195
- Shouldn't We Wait for the day?
- You think it Would be safer?

238
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,192
- SomehoW, yes.
- Primitive superstition.

239
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,236
I don't care.

240
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,275
- Quiet.
- Sorry.

241
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,636
Which Way noW?

242
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,756
Over here.

243
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,148
- Debbie, come in. It's Joe.
- 'What is it, Joe?'

244
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,915
I just saW something.
A light in the forest near the house.

245
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,797
'Check it out.'

246
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,793
No Way. I'm not going Without back-up.
Have Ben get out here.

247
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,116
There it is.

248
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,072
- Are you sure about this?
- You Wanna keep having those dreams?

249
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,872
No.

250
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,988
What if that ghost you saW Was right?
That this thing Will destroy us all.

251
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,791
I just Wish
someone else had found it.

252
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,678
Well, HoWard, give me a hand.

253
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,432
Gravediggers?
I don't think so.

254
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,715
I am not going doWn there.

255
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,473
Exactly. You're going
to be our base man.

256
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:18,634
Radios Won't Work underground,
so We brought the intercom.

257
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,190
Here. My car keys,
just in case something goes Wrong.

258
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,870
- I've gotta stay up here all alone?
- There's alWays the cop back on the road.

259
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,032
HoW long do you think this Will take?

260
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,715
Well, it's nine o'clock.
We should get a move on.

261
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,157
HoWard, if you leave this spot, turn off
the intercom so no one Will hear.

262
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,708
OK. Be careful, Carter.

263
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,917
Sure thing. Don't fall asleep.

264
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,275
That's not gonna be a problem.

265
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,676
Here.

266
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,593
I Want you to take notes
of everything that I say.

267
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,636
- Why?
- Just do it.

268
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,676
OK.

269
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,996
Hey. Good luck.

270
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,116
Thanks, HoWard. Same to you.

271
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,196
I hope I don't need it.

272
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,716
I hate nights like this.

273
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,756
Come on, then.

274
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,871
Aah!

275
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,951
Perfectly normal.

276
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,238
The coffins rot
and the bones shift in the soft soil.

277
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,190
- Seems to be getting more open.
- Yes.

278
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,590
You think that creature of yours
made these tunnels?

279
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,875
I don't see Why anyone else Would.

280
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,472
- What Was that?
- The creature, I think.

281
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,120
It's someWhere ahead.

282
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,469
I am questioning the sanity of this.

283
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:58,271
What an addenda to your oral history
if you prove the legends to be real.

284
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:03,150
- No one's ever done that before.
- Perhaps they didn't live to tell the tale.

285
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,594
All right, my boy. Scholarly vanity
triumphs over common sense.

286
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,792
- 'HoWard?'
- Yeah?

287
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,155
- 'HoWard?'
- OW!

288
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,431
- You scared the hell out of me.
- We're about 100 feet in.

289
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,398
The creature has been in here
and may be up ahead.

290
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,675
Don't get yourself killed.

291
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,069
'I'll check in every 15 or 20 minutes.'

292
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,072
Hopefully you'll be back by then.
It's getting creepy.

293
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,674
'Keep a stiff upper lip. Later.'

294
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,717
Well...there's the reason.

295
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,872
This must be Tanya's friend, Wendy
Barnes.

296
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,708
Whatever carved these tunnels
Was looking for food.

297
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,280
The flesh of fresh corpses.

298
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:17,036
Which Would explain the extent of them.
It Would have taken decades to dig.

299
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,035
Yes. This graveyard Was abandoned
in the early 1 800s.

300
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,512
Whatever did this
had large canines and incisors...

301
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,632
not human
and look there, those claW marks.

302
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,432
Definitely not human.

303
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,552
That's a dog. That's just a dog.

304
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,039
Dog.

305
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,389
I think We've found something here.

306
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,872
Carter, come here.

307
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,116
I've never seen runes like this.

308
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,512
I have. Alhazred dreW figures
like these in the Necronomicon.

309
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,759
I don't read Arabic, but I knoW
enough Greek for the annotations.

310
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,912
I read Arabic, but this...

311
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:38,118
This...is the Writing of R'lyeh.

312
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,749
This is the language of Cthulhu himself.

313
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,877
Who Would have put this here?
Joshua Winthrop?

314
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,748
He did have the reputation
of being a great Witch, but...

315
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,196
I get the sense that this is infinitely older.

316
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,192
Just look at the antiquity of this cave.

317
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,036
Could this relate to the legend
of the Outer Beings?

318
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,633
Vermont, Maine,
but not this far south, surely.

319
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,068
Carter? Carter, come here.

320
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,794
Something is doWn there.

321
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,116
Er...perhaps We should Wait.

322
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,953
If it's HoWard's creature, We can't Wait.

323
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,636
Up ahead. Close.

324
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,916
This must be HoWard's creature.

325
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,356
See Where the arm is healing
from the break and the cheek?

326
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,353
- Argh!
- She's healing fast.

327
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,671
Don't provoke her. I'm not sure
hoW strong those roots are.

328
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,149
If I'm right, they're more than roots.

329
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,236
I've got to look at this
under a microscope.

330
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,432
'HoWard. HoWard?'

331
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,837
It's good to hear your voice.
It's been an hour.

332
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,913
Found your creature alive and kicking.
It's trapped as in your dream.

333
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,310
Listen to me, Carter. Kill it.

334
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,188
That's What the old man in the dream said -
you have to kill it.

335
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:45,638
It's more than that. Remember the journal?
It might be Winthrop's daughter.

336
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,950
'l don't care. Just kill it!'

337
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:52,079
- Simultaneous life forms.
- I have to go. I'll stay in touch.

338
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,719
Carter? Carter?

339
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,756
Look.

340
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,475
They pass right through each other.

341
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:06,953
The human blood cells existing
With Whatever those grey cells are.

342
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,996
I suppose they're blood.

343
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,551
So it is possible.

344
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,756
This...

345
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,149
This is quantum physics.

346
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,550
That's What Barger said it Was,
the glyphs in the book.

347
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,632
Right. NoW, if I've got this correctly,

348
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:37,718
What We've got here is tWo solid bodies
occupying the same space simultaneously.

349
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,510
The one human,
the other...one dare not speculate.

350
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,636
That means they might be separated.

351
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:49,070
That Would involve
a huge expenditure of energy.

352
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,948
That is Why quantum physics
is a theoretical subject.

353
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,758
What about the book?

354
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:59,789
I can't believe that Winthrop and the
mad Arab kneW What they Were doing.

355
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,839
Besides, Alhazred copied this
from an earlier source.

356
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,195
There are several pages missing anyway.

357
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,717
What if Winthrop didn't do it?
Perhaps the creature has the ability.

358
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,439
That's an interesting idea.

359
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,593
What if it has the ability
to move its oWn atoms and electrons?

360
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,035
So it can enter another creature.

361
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,634
Then it might be possible
to induce it to move out.

362
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,672
Yes.

363
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:35,880
- What's this?
- That, my dear felloW, is insulin.

364
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,953
NoW, We inject the human body With insulin.

365
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,715
The creature thinks something
is Wrong With it, so it moves out.

366
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,314
- We don't Want to kill it.
- No.

367
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:51,155
But What is the natural antidote
for an excess of insulin?

368
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,591
Sugar.

369
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,749
We must keep her still.
I don't Want to break the needle.

370
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,435
I believe Joshua Winthrop
called his daughter Alyda.

371
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,798
Alyda? That's very appropriate.
It's Greek for "Winged Woman".

372
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,552
Alyda?

373
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,912
Alyda, you have nothing to fear.

374
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,072
Good... NoW.

375
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,589
It's feeling the effect.

376
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,912
- Let's just hope it Works.
- If it doesn't, Will they both die?

377
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,636
- Let's hope so.
- If not, Which Will leave the other?

378
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,712
- The demon Will leave.
- Is that a good idea?

379
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,554
NoW you mention it, no.

380
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,033
Carter, What's going on?

381
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,036
It Worked.

382
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,039
Carter, it Worked!

383
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,793
- Where's the creature?
- Gone.

384
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,509
Miles aWay, light years aWay.

385
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,036
Gone back to Whatever dimension
it came from.

386
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,590
- Professor Warren, insulin shock.
- Yes, of course.

387
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,194
Come on noW, Alyda. Come on.

388
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,637
There's a good girl.
There's a good girl. Come on.

389
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,429
Yes, yes. You're all right noW.
You're all right noW.

390
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,631
The creature could not exist
Without the girl.

391
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,713
Once it sensed that her life Was in peril,
it had to WithdraW.

392
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,918
Then again...it might still be here.

393
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,998
Carter, talk to me or I'm going for help!

394
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,196
'Carter, What's going on?'

395
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,512
HoWard, We seem to have got rid
of the creature.

396
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,989
I can't talk noW. I can't hear.

397
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,230
I'll get back to you.

398
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,872
Carter?

399
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,474
She's droWsy, but she is recovering.

400
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:41,071
I'm having extraordinary difficulty
disengaging her from this root.

401
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:46,996
There's nothing physically binding her,
but I'm damned if I can...

402
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:52,473
- Winthrop. The book. Tree spells.
- Tree spells.

403
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,152
Are you saying you think she's spellbound?

404
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,071
Yes.

405
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,879
Carter, I'm a rationalist and a sceptic.

406
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:12,040
After What I've seen today, I suppose
I'm prepared to believe anything.

407
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,274
This isn't going to Work anyway.
There's a page missing.

408
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,193
- The pages in the library?
- Could be.

409
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,912
Ah. This might do it.

410
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,875
"Yig, Father of Serpents,
beseech these spirits to listen.

411
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,589
"You have served Lord Cthulhu
and his servants Well.

412
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,636
"Your task is done."

413
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,913
I haven't read this sort of stuff for years.

414
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,232
Besides, the inflections
may have changed over the centuries.

415
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,548
"Yig, abu il hiat...

416
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,509
"k'lyeh atol'eh rut'eh ismal.

417
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,510

418
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:14,072
"Cthulhu...uns san ut dabaho imne.

419
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,197
"ll shagal haloos."

420
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,796
It doesn't seem to be doing the trick.

421
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,238
Perhaps my performance intimidated her.

422
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,071
- Good heavens!
- Good. Good.

423
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,396
It left no marks.

424
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,472
It fleW through the solid Wall
and left no marks.

425
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,597
Incredible. Absolutely incredible.

426
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,753
Yes. Carter, Would you mind
giving us a hand here, please?

427
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,676
Come, noW, my dear.

428
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,833
Rest here for a second or tWo.

429
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,032
That's good. That's good.

430
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,111
Father?

431
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,036
Your father's um...

432
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,150
But you are safe.
You understand? You're safe.

433
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,432
Damn it, Carter! We didn't get a photo!

434
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,513
HoW could We have been so stupid?
We did not get a photo of the beast.

435
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,160
Professor, no one Will believe us anyway.

436
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,471
I think We can establish
her age by biological means.

437
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,030
HoWard can take her to safety
and We'll search out the other half.

438
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:14,875
I'm sure it has gone back
to Wherever it originally came from.

439
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,349
In a Way, it's too bad.

440
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,231
Yes.

441
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,028
You tWo go on ahead. I'll tidy things up
here and seal the place.

442
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,759
We'll come back tomorroW With help.

443
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,756
Father?

444
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,434
No. Come.

445
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,991
Go on. Go on.

446
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,435
You go With Carter noW, Alyda.

447
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,352
Carter?

448
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,272
Carter?

449
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,679
- HoWard?
- Yes, Professor?

450
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,797
- Has Carter reached the surface?
- 'No, sir.'

451
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,236
- Tell him to call me When he does.
- Yes, sir.

452
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,955
Come on, come on.

453
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,195
HoWard. Fancy meeting you here.

454
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,594
- What the hell's going on?
- I've brought the creature With me.

455
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,636
God, no, Carter!

456
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,553
Oh, my God. That's a naked Woman.

457
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:24,316
- May I present Alyda Winthrop?
- Carter, this is not...

458
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,312
- Of course, you tWo have met.
- Car...ter?

459
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,153
- She talks.
- Carter.

460
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,798
A bit.

461
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,919
Maybe I didn't describe the creature Well.
This is not her.

462
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,754
It is. We left half of her out.
Hopefully the dangerous half.

463
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:44,038
Professor Warren Wants to talk to you.
Something's going on doWn there.

464
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,438
Professor?

465
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,553
- Professor Warren?
- 'Carter. It's still here.'

466
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,519
I haven't actually seen it,
but I think it's in the cave.

467
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:03,833
'l have set up a Polaroid to take
a photograph to confirm its existence.'

468
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,390
- I'm coming doWn.
- No, you mustn't come doWn.

469
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,119
Carter, if anything should happen to me,
get the girl Well aWay from here.

470
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,511
She's the key, you see.

471
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,310
I think that the beast cannot exist Without
her.

472
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,710
If they became meshed together
in their infancy,

473
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,396
then somehoW their molecules have
assumed a symbiotic relationship.

474
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,996
You're going to need help.
Professor Thurber's very good and...

475
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,957
Aaagh!

476
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,912
Aaagh!

477
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,676
Professor! Professor Warren.
Professor Warren.

478
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,990
- I'm going doWn there.
- No Way.

479
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,548
Professor Warren is dead and We're next.

480
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,679
- I started this.
- And you Won't finish it Without help.

481
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,716
It's not human, that thing doWn there.

482
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:31,156
Oh, Carter.
I got a real bad feeling about this.

483
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,632
- Carter...
- See? Even she's got the right idea.

484
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,836
- Carter.
- Let's go.

485
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,710
- What's Wrong?
- It must be cold. Give it a feW seconds.

486
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,314
We don't have seconds. Let's run for it.

487
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,274
Aagh!

488
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,998
I got it. Hold on.

489
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:42,795
- It just stood up.
- I can't believe you've just let it loose.

490
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,477
We're dead. It's going to hunt us doWn
and tear us apart.

491
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,996
- It Wants Alyda.
- I can pull right over and let her out.

492
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,116
That's not like you, HoWard.

493
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,275
I'm sorry. I've been through hell, Carter.

494
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,749
We'll make it, HoWard.
Just get us back to the university.

495
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,434
In one piece.

496
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,469
You'll be safe.

497
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,516
Do you understand?

498
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,752
Father...

499
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,196
is dead.

500
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,671
Yes, he is.

501
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,516
We'd better hurry.

502
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,430
- What noW? The police, right?
- No. We need proof first.

503
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:57,389
- No. First We need to get clothes on her.
- Huh? Oh, yes, of course.

504
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,313
No.

505
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,672
No house.

506
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:10,757
Alyda, don't be afraid.
It'll be all right. Trust me.

507
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,796
Come on. Let's go.

508
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,352
Come on.

509
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,429
Everybody must be asleep.

510
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,272
Hurry.

511
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:21,039
Carter? Figured it Would be you.
I Was Wondering...

512
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:29,757
Can it Wait, Barger?
It's 1.30 in the morning.

513
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,592
Come on.

514
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,915
- Carter?
- Just go back to bed.

515
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,796
What in the hell is going on here?

516
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,395
- Nothing. Just go back to bed.
- Nothing. You got to be kidding.

517
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,756
Carter With a naked Woman.
This is monumental.

518
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,115
Barger, just go back to bed.

519
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,636
Don't tell anyone about this.
I'll tell you about it tomorroW.

520
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,518
- HoWard, get her something to Wear.
- Yeah.

521
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:00,957
- Mary might have something.
- No. Robert, not Mary!

522
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:05,318
And Jack. Everybody's
gonna knoW about her noW.

523
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:09,676
We have to move quickly. Here.
Do you understand me?

524
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,229
Carter.

525
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,676
Yes. I'm Randolph Carter
and you're Alyda Winthrop.

526
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,716
Yes. Alyda.

527
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,918
I... I...

528
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,433
I...?

529
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:31,152
Her father must have talked to her
because inside her memory, there's Words.

530
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:34,118
Think of it. She lived in the 1 7th century.

531
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,875
She can't tell us about
the Revolutionary War. She Was in an attic.

532
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:41,396
Think of the biological
and genetic implications.

533
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:44,074
Let's think about staying alive.

534
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,799
I suspect that the other half is on its Way.

535
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,350
If Professor Warren is right,
it can't survive Without her.

536
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,035
Then We can't let it have her back.
But for hoW long?

537
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:58,716
Not long enough. It's probably stronger
Without the human half.

538
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,078
- And you and the professor let it loose.
- I'm afraid so.

539
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,228
HoWard.

540
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,033
Carter.

541
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,793
Alyda, I'm going in the other room.

542
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,110
Stay. Stay in here.

543
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,309
No. No.

544
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,356
No, Carter.

545
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,196
Please?

546
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,235
All right, Alyda, but you must stay there.

547
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,956
Stay.

548
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,714
She's really taken a shine to you.

549
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,439
Look, I think We have a Way out of this.

550
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,911
- We have to take Alyda to the clinic.
- To prove she's 300 years old?

551
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,037
Or that she's got
some of the creature left in her.

552
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,793
Then We knoW
What the creature's composed of.

553
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,189
- But is that going to help us?
- Yes.

554
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:11,673
We also have to recover some of the pages
from the library. These pages may help us.

555
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,230
- What about the police?
- Then We'll bring in the police.

556
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:19,029
- And they're going to believe us?
- Oh, they'll believe us.

557
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:23,875
- HoW did We get ourselves into this?
- Curiosity. Does it every time.

558
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,633
Joe?

559
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,592
Wake up.

560
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,233
Joe?

561
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,274
Joe, Where the hell are you?

562
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,713
Joe...

563
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,472
Shit!

564
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,358
Debbie?

565
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,556
I tried to stop him.

566
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:05,471
Carter?

567
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,712
Mary brought up some clothes.

568
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,190
Holy coW.

569
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:25,429
- Hi there...
- Back off. What have you done to her?
