1
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,396
You know what happens
at that height?

2
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,064
The brain dies
from lack of oxygen.

3
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,730
Cell by cell.

4
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:49,405
It just shuts down.
And the body goes with it.

5
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,413
I can't stop thinking about
what it must have been like.

6
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,288
Why don't you start at the beginning?
It's always the easiest.

7
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,621
Okay.

8
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,964
I'll start at the beginning.

9
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,161
I grew up on the plains
in Indiana.

10
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,164
I was a flatlander through
and through.

11
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,160
To be honest, I really
didn't have much to leave behind.

12
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,172
Virtually no family and
very few friends.

13
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,835
Anyway, it was January.

14
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,175
I'd already been in London,
a year and a half...

15
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,183
For the first six months,
I'd been incredibly lonely.

16
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,511
Then I met Jake.

17
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,519
What I loved the most was how
comfortable we were with each other.

18
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,189
I felt safe.

19
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,540
Okay, let's go.

20
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,878
I design CD-ROMs and web sites
for corporate clients.

21
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,214
- That must pay well.
- I sound fancier than it is.

22
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,122
Jake was an engineer.

23
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,557
Tunnels and bridges,
that sort of thing.

24
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,898
He kept his tube tickets in a wallet
he got when he was twelve.

25
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,227
Same wallet.
Same inside pocket.

26
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,071
Alice?

27
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,402
I'll see you later.

28
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,150
- Hey, Alice. You going in?
- Yeah.

29
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,004
- I'll see you in a minute.
- Okay.

30
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,375
Reconfigure the training
program manual...

31
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,719
...to make it look like
a game on the web site.

32
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,714
We tried that with
the Appliance Kings.

33
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,389
Yeah, this isn't about
washing machines.

34
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,388
Now we're training
a worldwide sales force.

35
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,960
You're the new media pioneers.

36
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,731
Think of something.

37
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,404
Alice, you still have
the old template, don't you?

38
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,411
Are you with us, Alice?

39
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,254
I'm going out to get my hair trimmed.
I'll be back after lunch.

40
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:06,785
Shoot!

41
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,806
- And you got in?
- Yeah.

42
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,979
I got in.

43
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,692
- What's your name?
- Alice.

44
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,998
Don't turn away.

45
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,011
Come here tomorrow.

46
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,347
I have to work.

47
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,695
Then, come back tonight.

48
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,693
I can't.

49
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,530
Whenever you want, Alice.
You decide...

50
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,538
...and I'll be here.

51
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,549
I couldn't believe what
had happened that day.

52
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,890
I knew it shouldn't
happen again.

53
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,227
I wanted everything back
the way it was.

54
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,403
What do you want me to do?

55
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,411
Nothing. Just keep doing
what you're doing.

56
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,467
That's when I found out
his name.

57
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,803
Adam Tallis.

58
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,472
And that he climbed mountains.

59
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,978
He caused quite a stir here yesterday.

60
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,651
He saved six people
up there.

61
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,313
No oxygen.

62
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,536
- You stop me whenever you want.
- Please, don't stop.

63
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,879
Please, don't stop.

64
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,556
I bought your book today.

65
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,559
It isn't my book.

66
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,887
I'm just in it.

67
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,557
It looks good.

68
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,234
People died, Alice.

69
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,579
Something went very wrong.

70
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,589
There was a woman
named Françoise Colet.

71
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,269
I lost her whole group.

72
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,939
I still don't understand what happened.

73
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,943
There was no room for error.
Everything had been checked.

74
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,779
I was in love with her.

75
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,123
Do you know what it's like
over twenty thousand feet?

76
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,130
It's like this.

77
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,803
Without air,
the brain cells die.

78
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,137
It shuts down.

79
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,142
And then the rest
of the body follows.

80
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,653
It has been two years...

81
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,329
...and it doesn't go away.

82
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,000
I live with someone.

83
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,014
But you're here.

84
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,677
I have to go.

85
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,019
No.

86
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,027
Don't put them on.

87
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,044
- Hello?
- Hi. Where are you?

88
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,278
I'm running some errands.

89
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,289
Ah. Do you think you can pick up
my watch on the way home?

90
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,053
- I'm running behind schedule.
- Of course I can.

91
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,390
I missed you today, Alice.

92
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,566
Miss you.

93
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,069
- I love you.
- Love you.

94
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,748
Knock it! Knock... Nice!

95
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,592
And give it!

96
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,088
What are you doing?!

97
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,778
Oh God, ref.
That's a bit harsh.

98
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,782
- Jake?
- Yeah, sorry, I'm just...

99
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,456
Oh, there's nobody there!

100
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,129
Jake, I have to leave you.

101
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,124
- You what?
- I can't go on like this. I'm sorry.

102
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,468
I have to leave.

103
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,474
You have, you have to leave me?

104
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,815
Alice...

105
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,158
...we're together.

106
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,827
We're perfect together.

107
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,824
I wanna marry you.

108
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,497
I met somebody.

109
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,184
Who?
Who did you meet?

110
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,178
You don't know him.

111
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,349
- I'm sorry.
- When did you meet him?

112
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,591
I didn't mean to hurt you.
It's not the point.

113
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,695
It's very much the point!

114
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,031
We go to the market together
every Sunday.

115
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,026
I buy your fucking
tube tickets for you!

116
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,033
Jesus!

117
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,706
Where are you going?

118
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,076
You were looking for Adam?
He's not here at the moment.

119
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,742
It's cold out there, come in.

120
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,075
Please, come in.

121
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,926
I've been climbing in Chile.

122
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,597
Adam always takes
these pictures down.

123
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,268
Or makes sure his back
is turned to them.

124
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,931
Oh, please, sit down.

125
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,606
For me, pictures
tell me who I am.

126
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,606
But for Adam,
they steal his soul.

127
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,946
- Want some?
- No, thank you.

128
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,948
- No, it's quite good.
- No.

129
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,958
Oh, I'm his sister.

130
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,628
- You're his sister?
- Yep. I'm Deborah.

131
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,965
We climb together a lot.

132
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,964
He was having some work done
on his place, so...

133
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,964
...he stayed here while
I was gone.

134
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,637
This...

135
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,310
...is Mr. Know-It-AII.

136
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,649
It's his name.

137
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,985
This is Françoise, right?

138
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,318
That's the real reason my brother
takes the pictures down.

139
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:45,656
Because it's... it's too hard
for him to see her.

140
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,665
My brother's a brave guy,
but sometimes...

141
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,340
...he's afraid of remembering.

142
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:03,837
What he forgets is that he's not
the only one responsible.

143
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,517
I was up there too.

144
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,851
She was my best friend, Alice.

145
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,860
Yes, I know your name.

146
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,865
You're very beautiful.

147
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,877
I can see why he'd fall
so hard for you.

148
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,546
The thing about my brother...

149
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,220
...is you're either with him
or you're not.

150
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:51,221
And once you've made the jump
and you're with him, that's it.

151
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,557
There's no discussion.

152
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,899
Can I have his address?

153
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,901
Yes, of course.

154
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,248
Thank you.

155
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,652
I left him.

156
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,998
You're hurting me.

157
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,869
Adam?

158
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,215
Morning.

159
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,219
Alice, this is Joanna.
Joanna, Alice.

160
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,896
Joanna Noble from
"The Guardian".

161
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,892
I'm interviewing Adam about
his Himalayan clean-up project.

162
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,561
Nice to meet you.

163
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,902
Where can I find a shirt?

164
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,610
Adam?

165
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,609
- Your phone.
- Could you get that for me?

166
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,615
No one there.

167
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:44,288
And it’s just become a playground
for the rich and inexperienced.

168
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,528
I have to go to work.

169
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,470
- Will you think about me today?
- Yes.

170
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,139
- What are you doing today?
- Thinking about you.

171
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,477
- Do you want to learn how to climb?
- Sure.

172
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,814
- Come and see me after work.
- Okay.

173
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,368
He's good.

174
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,538
He's not as strong as he was
last week tough.

175
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,372
Ah, he'll get there.

176
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,878
- Hi.
- It's great to see you.

177
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,443
I see you've got a harness.

178
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,112
- Do you want to put it on?
- I guess.

179
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:22,556
Just put your feet in there and
pull it like a pair of trousers.

180
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,892
That's great.

181
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:37,404
That's right, double back
and look, there we go.

182
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,736
- It suits you.
- Thank you.

183
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,642
It's okay. I'm helping her.

184
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,755
Hi. How are you?

185
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,750
I'm sorry.

186
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,093
- Let me check your harness.
- Okay.

187
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,425
Seems to be good.

188
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,105
She's my sister, but she drives me
mad. I swear it's chemical.

189
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,106
- Are you ready?
- Well, no. Maybe.

190
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,613
Well, finally, Alice.

191
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,280
The flatlander who captured
the mountain boy.

192
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,283
Alice, meet Klaus.
Klaus, Alice.

193
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,285
I liked your book.

194
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,621
Well, thank you.

195
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,625
Well, nice to meet you.

196
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,472
This looks hard.

197
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,800
It's all in the mind.

198
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,053
I mean, my taste in clothes
has completely changed.

199
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:09,496
I bought this practically
transparent pink T-shirt.

200
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,833
And I won't even tell you
about the lingerie.

201
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:17,504
No, it's probably best. I'm still in
the big white cotton panties.

202
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,845
I'm sorry, I'm a little maniac.

203
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,842
Have you seen Jake?

204
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,846
Course I have, he's been
my friend for fifteen years.

205
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:32,422
How is he?

206
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,856
He's smoking like a fiend
and he's completely fucked up.

207
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,863
It's not like there's
no reason, is there?

208
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,529
Sorry.

209
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:50,207
I think that you're destroying
both of your lives.

210
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,870
I'm sorry.

211
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,880
You had somebody
who loved you.

212
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:04,544
You loved each other and
you let him go for good sex.

213
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,558
Love isn’t just a good fuck, you know.

214
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,894
- This is more.
- More what?

215
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:13,230
More everything. When I'm with him,
everything is more.

216
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,897
Oh, God! You could write greeting
cards, you really bloody could.

217
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,071
I'm sorry.

218
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,072
Right.

219
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:35,651
Let's get out of here. I could do with
some retail therapy myself I think.

220
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:39,086
I can't. I'm gonna see Adam at three
o'clock and you can meet him.

221
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,985
I've been spending way too much
money and I saw this dress...

222
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,757
...and it was in this really
amazing store.

223
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,095
Really?

224
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,937
- Give it here. Come on.
- Oh my God, Alice!

225
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,607
It's okay, she's fine.

226
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,974
Call the police.

227
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,652
Adam! Stop!

228
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,980
Stop!

229
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,331
When I saw him...
Oh, Jesus.

230
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,001
That'll never happen again.
I won't let it.

231
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,232
Are you all right?

232
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,843
Are you okay?

233
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,346
- I'll always be here, Alice.
- Yeah.

234
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,679
I'll protect you.
Say you believe me.

235
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,518
I believe you.

236
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,686
Marry me.

237
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,356
Marry me.

238
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,026
And soon.

239
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,028
Tomorrow.

240
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,701
The day after. As soon as possible.
Marry me.

241
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,371
Yes.

242
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,219
Sir, can we ask you
some questions, please?

243
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,418
"Use your head, Alice. What do
you really know about him?"

244
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,425
- Hey, you ready?
- Look at this.

245
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,767
Someone is trying to scare you.

246
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,104
There was another call this morning,
but they didn't say anything.

247
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,330
It makes me sick.

248
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:47,433
If anything else happens like this
again, make sure you tell me.

249
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,776
- Okay?
- Okay.

250
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,775
You'll be fine.

251
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,205
Do you, Alice, promise to love
and cherish Adam...

252
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,214
...for as long as
you both shall live?

253
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,648
I do.

254
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,319
And do you, Adam, promise
to love and cherish Alice...

255
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,988
...for as long as
you both shall live?

256
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,326
I do.

257
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:40,653
May the Lord bless this union and
secure it from all harm.

258
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,079
How do you know the priest?

259
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,192
This is my family church.

260
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,861
You have a family church?

261
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,531
I have a mother that doesn't talk
to me and a dad I've never met.

262
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,862
It doesn't matter. Our life began
when we first saw each other.

263
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,205
- I need you to see something.
- What?

264
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,784
No, no, no wait.

265
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:47,227
Now I want you to see this through
my eyes when I was six.

266
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,900
Look... like this.

267
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,573
You know the story that
we're broken into two pieces...

268
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:05,245
...and we spend our lives searching
for our other half?

269
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,246
You're it.

270
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,256
Okay, here we are.

271
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,259
We're getting dressed here?

272
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,770
Yep. Here.

273
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,788
No, no, don't do that. I need
to remember you like this.

274
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,313
Come on, before you freeze to death.

275
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,315
Come on.

276
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,826
Alice?

277
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,677
This is the only way station
for hikers in the whole area.

278
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,685
The church has kept supplies
up here for years.

279
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,362
You went hiking
on your wedding day?

280
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,695
It was his idea of romance.

281
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,697
Adam.

282
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:14,272
I thought that a honeymoon was
lying in bed with room service.

283
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:18,041
Oh, I'll give you a honeymoon
you won't forget. I promise.

284
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,385
No, no, no, sit down.
Sit down.

285
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,715
Choose your rhythm and then
commit to following it.

286
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,718
Count if you have to.

287
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,900
I'm gonna make you strong.

288
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,575
I wanted him
to be proud of me.

289
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,244
So I followed
the trail for hours.

290
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,444
Adam?

291
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,793
You made it.

292
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,972
- What's that?
- It's an anchor.

293
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,982
To catch a falling body.

294
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:02,982
Catch.

295
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,658
Do you trust me?

296
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,663
Don't move.

297
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,207
I gave up all control.

298
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,544
I let him decide when
I could breathe...

299
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,879
...and when I couldn't.

300
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,381
And I loved it.

301
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,434
I love you.

302
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,596
I love you. God, I love you!

303
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,619
We returned to London and
Joanna Noble's article came out.

304
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,623
I was happier than I'd ever been...

305
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,790
Excuse me.

306
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,511
Hello, Jake?

307
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,682
No, it's Sylvie speaking.
Hello, Alice.

308
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,352
I must have dialed wrong.
I thought I was calling Jake.

309
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,019
Oh, no, no, that's fine. I just
happened to be over actually.

310
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,684
Jake's gonna be back soon, I think.

311
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,926
Look, Alice, this is gonna
sound a bit weird...

312
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:34,030
...and I was definitely
gonna tell you but...

313
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,361
...Jake and I have actually
been seeing each other.

314
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,696
You and Jake?

315
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,367
Well, it... it just sort of happened.

316
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,537
Did you move in?

317
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,048
Yeah, I did.
Sort of.

318
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,218
Oh, God.

319
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,952
How cliché is this?

320
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,717
Old friend moves in to console
jilted boyfriend...

321
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,390
...and then these two
find themselves together.

322
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,557
Are you gonna be okay with this?

323
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,790
Yeah, I'm okay.

324
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,231
Alice...

325
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,563
We're gonna be late. Hurry up.

326
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,569
Alice?

327
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,902
Yeah, I gotta go. We'll talk
about it later, okay?

328
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,928
Here we go.

329
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,929
Good evening.
Good evening, Adam.

330
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,436
Hey, Alice. Alice, I'm sorry.

331
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,116
Sorry.
Excuse me.

332
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,627
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

333
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,689
It's Alice Tallis.

334
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,355
My rhyming sister-in-law.

335
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,695
Are you okay?

336
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,923
I have a headache and
I was looking for some aspirin.

337
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,363
Oh, no, give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

338
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,706
- Can you feel that?
- Yeah, it really hurts.

339
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,705
Close your eyes.

340
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:39,712
Breathe.

341
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,048
Slowly.

342
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,230
That's good.

343
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,901
It's a meridian that
controls the kidney...

344
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:04,900
...or the brain
or the left big toe.

345
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,570
I forget which.

346
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:12,248
But it's whatever
works, right?

347
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:15,919
Thank you.

348
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:18,250
Close your eyes.

349
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,417
Close your eyes.

350
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,763
Okay, you can open.

351
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,091
Oh my God!

352
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,770
I want to drink to that beautiful
lady in blue. Where is she?

353
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,439
I don't think she's ever climbed
past the third floor,

354
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,116
but she has conquered our Adam.

355
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:52,444
What she doesn't know is that
to get Adam she also gets us.

356
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,637
Most of the people using
the program are women.

357
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,530
And we tried to sell them a game.
But women don't like games.

358
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,302
Women lime stories.
Men like games.

359
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,979
Men like to slay the dragon
and get the princess.

360
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:17,870
But women like
to know...

361
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:20,313
...how the dragon and the princess
get in there in the first place.

362
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,654
A game is the wrong approach.

363
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:31,991
Sorry.

364
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:36,897
Alice Tallis.

365
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:39,332
This is Joanna Noble.
Do you remember me?

366
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,227
Oh yes, I remember you.

367
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,999
I got a weird note
about the article.

368
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:49,672
I'm not gonna do anything with it.
I'm certainly not gonna follow it up.

369
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,238
It's probably stupid of me...

370
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:55,010
but I somehow felt obliged
to tell you about it.

371
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,022
Shall I send it to you?

372
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:01,016
Yeah, you can send it.

373
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,352
Is it private?

374
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,256
I don't want this sitting
in a public in-basket.

375
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:09,365
- I understand. You can fax it.
- Okay. I'll do that.

376
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,701
- You have the number?
- Yeah, I got it from your secretary.

377
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:13,302
Okay, thanks for calling.

378
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,030
Sorry, I had
to take that.

379
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,702
No problem.
Gave me a chance to think.

380
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:24,377
We shouldn't be playing games. It's
obvious. Women don't like games.

381
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,713
I think this project needs
a new face.

382
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,716
Dear Joanna Noble, what you wrote
made me sick.

383
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,389
Your big hero, Adam Tallis,
raped me.

384
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,058
Why don't you try reporting the truth?

385
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,892
It's out of paper.

386
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,239
I've decided that from now on...

387
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,909
...this is Alice's project.

388
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:54,903
You're the new point man.

389
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,576
I mean, point girl.
Woman.

390
00:51:58,615 --> 00:51:59,912
Excellent.

391
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,924
- Congratulations, Alice.
- Thank you.

392
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,264
- Open or closed?
- Closed.

393
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,508
Ligue para a vítima se quiser
a verdade: Michelle Stowe.

394
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:28,111
Fuck!

395
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,511
Alice Tallis' office.

396
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,520
Hello. Claudia? It's Adam.

397
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,955
- Oh, hi, Adam.
- Is Alice there?

398
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,954
- No, she’s just left actually.
- Where did she go?

399
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,290
I think she went to the doctor's.

400
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,872
You thought this woman
was sending the notes.

401
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:03,980
Yes.

402
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:27,166
Hello, I'm Joanna Noble
from "The Guardian".

403
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,833
I called you before.
Are you Michelle Stowe?

404
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,835
Yeah, I am. Come in.

405
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,838
I was having a birthday party.

406
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,842
I asked him to dance...

407
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,177
...and then... I don't know...

408
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,849
...we started kissing.

409
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,852
I was shit-faced.

410
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,197
Think I even put
my hand in his shirt.

411
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,192
Then we went outside.

412
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,033
I guess the air must have
straightened me up,

413
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,704
cos I remember wondering...

414
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,375
...what the hell I was doing.

415
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,221
Then he pulled me
into the bushes.

416
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,224
Undid my dress.

417
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,568
There was a zip.

418
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,897
In the back.

419
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,905
I was so young.

420
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,247
I started to cry.

421
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,921
He put his hand over my mouth
and kept going.

422
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,924
He's strong.
There was nothing I could do.

423
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,428
I tried to fight him.

424
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:15,441
When he was done, he shook me
and said something like...

425
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:21,113
"It's only sex, just sex."

426
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,446
He got up...

427
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,115
...and left the party with his sister.

428
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:37,633
So...

429
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,799
...you wanna write an article
about this, then?

430
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:45,467
I mean, he's not royal or anything,
but he's close enough.

431
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,478
We could make some money
out of this, Joanna.

432
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,480
It doesn't work that way.

433
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:02,158
Everybody's always blabbing about
who's sticking it into who.

434
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:08,661
You have no proof. This is a question
of 'he said, she said'.

435
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:14,003
Jesus, Alice.
I can't believe you did this.

436
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:17,332
What if she calls my editor?
I could be fired.

437
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:21,003
Do you think that nosy wives have
immunity from normal behavior?

438
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:25,007
I knew the minute I called that
it was a mistake. I'm sorry, Alice.

439
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:30,243
I thought you should know what I did.
It was really just innocent curiosity.

440
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:34,016
It's never innocent.
Curiosity gets people killed.

441
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,027
What would you do
if it was your husband?

442
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:39,919
I don't have one.

443
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:42,691
You not only have one, but one
who's wild about you.

444
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:48,037
You're right.
I have to trust him.

445
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:18,361
People have stories.
You and I... everyone.

446
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:23,272
But
couldn't tell you one complete
story about my husband.

447
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:29,174
Practically everything
knew about him
came from a book or a newspaper.

448
00:57:30,313 --> 00:57:33,180
Or shreds of information dropped
by other people.

449
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:35,377
I couldn't help myself...

450
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:38,284
I needed to know more.

451
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:09,248
Adele Blanchard.

452
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:18,225
It's crazy, but want to show
the world my bruises.

453
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:23,232
What we're doing
is dangerous...

454
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:25,434
...but still can't help
wanting more.

455
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:36,245
The only way to end this
is to be brutal.

456
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,339
We have to stop
what we're doing.

457
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:42,251
I've decided to go back
to my husband.

458
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:46,253
I'm not strong enough to live
on the edge with you any more.

459
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:50,259
I know you won't fall,
but I will. I'm sure of it.

460
00:58:52,295 --> 00:58:55,355
This tears me apart, but
I have to go back to Michael.

461
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,359
I love you... Adele.

462
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:08,367
I've been thinking about you.

463
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:16,403
Me, too.

464
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:39,426
I called the office yesterday
looking for you.

465
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:41,394
Oh, yeah?

466
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:44,440
Claudia said you weren't feeling well,
thought you might be at the doctor's.

467
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:51,438
I... had an appointment but
I never got out of my meeting.

468
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,327
Where was the meeting?

469
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:10,366
At the client's hotel.

470
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:19,575
- Which hotel?
- The Hilton.

471
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:27,346
I'm sorry for being nosy.

472
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:31,351
I just like to picture what you do
during the day.

473
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,413
Where did you get this?

474
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,416
Deborah gave it to me.

475
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,424
She has good taste.

476
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:20,501
Adam?

477
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:24,438
I got a call about... a weird call
about the article.

478
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,544
And there was this woman
named Michelle Stowe.

479
01:02:28,678 --> 01:02:30,646
She sent a fax.

480
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:35,542
It didn't happen.
I never raped her.

481
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:38,647
I shouldn't have...

482
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,558
I've known her since
we were kids.

483
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:45,552
And think she saw me
as a way out.

484
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:49,465
If you'd met her, you'd understand.

485
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,468
I'm not surprised
she contacted you.

486
01:02:55,705 --> 01:02:58,572
I'm just sorry
you had to hear all that.

487
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,588
- Hurry up. Are you ready?
- I'll just get my jacket.

488
01:03:13,523 --> 01:03:14,581
Oh, hi, Alice.

489
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:21,494
I'm sorry to barge in like that,

490
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,691
but your husband refuses to understand
that sponsors need talk shows.

491
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,603
And knew he'd only
show up if drove.

492
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:36,473
Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna be on a talk show?

493
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:38,580
It’s just a stupid chat show.

494
01:03:42,718 --> 01:03:44,549
Bye, Alice.

495
01:04:13,716 --> 01:04:14,683
Shit!

496
01:05:41,837 --> 01:05:44,704
- Directory Inquiries?
- Yes... Adele Blanchard.

497
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:47,709
- Which city, please?
- It's London.

498
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:50,710
Do you have a listing for Adele
Blanchard on Marchmont Road?

499
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:52,609
One moment.

500
01:06:36,692 --> 01:06:38,751
- Yes?
- I'm looking for Adele Blanchard.

501
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:42,664
- I'm her mother.
- Is she home?

502
01:06:46,702 --> 01:06:48,727
You must be one
of her American friends.

503
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:50,669
We tried to contact everyone.

504
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:57,804
She's been missing
for eight months.

505
01:06:59,648 --> 01:07:00,706
Missing?

506
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,715
What did you say your name was?

507
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:05,813
Joanna.

508
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:08,714
She never tried to contact
her husband?

509
01:07:09,658 --> 01:07:11,683
Not even a letter to
an old boyfriend or something?

510
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:13,820
Eight months
and not a word.

511
01:07:15,664 --> 01:07:19,828
And this is from a daughter who manages
to e-mail her mother from Nepal.

512
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:30,644
Joanna, promise me you'll never
think the worst about Adele.

513
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:32,839
It helps a little if...

514
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:35,751
If one tries to be positive.

515
01:07:44,794 --> 01:07:46,853
She was so happy that day.

516
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,762
No jitters. Nothing.

517
01:07:54,703 --> 01:07:55,863
Do you know him?

518
01:07:57,706 --> 01:07:58,764
Adam Tallis.

519
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:01,869
She climbed all over the world
with him.

520
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:05,873
My son-in-law Michael is
a trader in Milan.

521
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:11,785
At first he never stood in her way
when it came to climbing.

522
01:08:13,823 --> 01:08:15,848
But after two years
he got fed up.

523
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:18,792
It was either climbing
or the marriage.

524
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:21,794
She chose the marriage.

525
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:26,697
The day before she was
supposed to go back to Milan...

526
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:31,807
...she went out...
And never came back.

527
01:08:35,744 --> 01:08:36,904
I found that in her bags.

528
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:40,806
It's probably the last picture
taken of her.

529
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:47,719
Today had two signs
that Adele is close by.

530
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,926
You arrived.
And Adam called.

531
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:02,736
He wanted to know if there was
anything new in the investigation.

532
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:06,900
Would you like to stay for dinner?

533
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:09,843
No, thank you. Just have
to get home. It's really late.

534
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:14,747
I'm disappointed.

535
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:16,952
He should be here
around five.

536
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:22,848
You and Adam
would love each other.

537
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:26,962
Sit, sit.
I'll get it.

538
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:50,808
Oh, Joanna, do you really have
to go now? What a shame.

539
01:09:51,954 --> 01:09:53,819
I was hopping that
you would stay a little.

540
01:11:13,135 --> 01:11:14,830
Adam?

541
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:49,087
What are you doing?

542
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:51,126
I'm making you mine.

543
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:01,236
Sometimes feel like
I don't know you.

544
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:03,229
Oh, you know me.

545
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:08,234
You know everything
you need to know.

546
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:12,205
Look at me.

547
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:17,149
Open your eyes.

548
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,050
Please.

549
01:14:20,189 --> 01:14:22,157
Open your eyes!

550
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:37,138
Have you been with another man?

551
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:41,037
No.

552
01:14:41,176 --> 01:14:45,044
What are you doing, then?
What's going on in there?

553
01:14:47,282 --> 01:14:49,250
Why do you keep
sneaking around?

554
01:14:50,185 --> 01:14:53,245
Is the suspicion exciting?
Do you need it to get off? What is it?

555
01:14:56,191 --> 01:14:58,056
I found Adele's letters.

556
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:03,059
You...

557
01:15:03,298 --> 01:15:06,131
...found... her letters?

558
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:11,139
Is that how you tell the story?

559
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:15,109
What, they were just sitting
on the table...

560
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:17,236
...and you just happened
to notice them?

561
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:35,254
Look what just happened to find.
These... and these.

562
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:40,066
And found these. Here, read them.
I have nothing to hide, Alice!

563
01:16:00,188 --> 01:16:02,156
To sneak around
behind my back because...

564
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:07,260
...you need it to get rougher
and rougher. Is that it?

565
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:11,163
I'm trying to understand you.

566
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,368
You do this
so punish you?

567
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:17,272
Is that where you're going?

568
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:29,114
Please, untie me.

569
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:31,116
If you trusted me...

570
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:35,223
...you wouldn't be in this position.

571
01:16:40,362 --> 01:16:42,159
I just...

572
01:16:42,364 --> 01:16:45,231
I wanted to know more
about you.

573
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:48,293
And wanted to
know your past.

574
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:50,338
And wanted to
know your stories.

575
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:56,242
I just thought if knew more,
that could love you more.

576
01:17:01,316 --> 01:17:05,184
I know the only thing that matters
is us together. Know that.

577
01:17:06,221 --> 01:17:08,382
Because when you're
not around I get lost.

578
01:17:10,425 --> 01:17:13,292
It drives me crazy to
think about losing you.

579
01:17:20,435 --> 01:17:22,300
I'm yours, Alice.

580
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:27,308
What more do you need to know?

581
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:38,412
I could break your neck.
I love you so much.

582
01:17:44,459 --> 01:17:46,427
Do you want to stay here?

583
01:17:47,362 --> 01:17:48,420
I mean,

584
01:17:50,365 --> 01:17:52,230
do you like this?

585
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:57,431
Adam...
have to pee.

586
01:18:45,287 --> 01:18:47,255
Oh, my God. Alice?

587
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:57,330
Alice, please don't do this!
Alice!

588
01:19:01,536 --> 01:19:03,299
Please.

589
01:19:04,272 --> 01:19:05,432
Where are you going?

590
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:10,344
Alice, please,
what are you doing?

591
01:19:37,372 --> 01:19:38,339
Alice?

592
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:40,498
And that's when
came to you.

593
01:20:59,487 --> 01:21:01,352
I want to be clear with you.

594
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:04,549
In my experience, charges of domestic
violence are too little too late.

595
01:21:05,393 --> 01:21:07,554
I want you to re-open
the Adele Blanchard case.

596
01:21:09,598 --> 01:21:11,566
Well, it's not easy to re-open
a case like this.

597
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,559
- Britain is swimming in missing persons.
- He killed her.

598
01:21:15,403 --> 01:21:18,372
Any case,
missing person or murder...

599
01:21:19,407 --> 01:21:22,570
needs evidence.
I have to ask you what you have.

600
01:21:23,578 --> 01:21:25,443
Adele's letters?

601
01:21:26,448 --> 01:21:27,380
No.

602
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:28,609
Warning notes?

603
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:31,416
- No.
- You have...

604
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:34,581
two photos.

605
01:21:35,657 --> 01:21:37,522
Proof of nothing.

606
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:41,629
- He raped Michelle.
- She never reported it.

607
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:51,630
Yes?

608
01:21:55,477 --> 01:21:57,445
Start without me.
I'll be thee in a bit.

609
01:22:02,684 --> 01:22:04,652
I'd like to help you, Mrs. Tallis.

610
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:09,650
...knew what everyone else does,
but we like it.

611
01:22:11,493 --> 01:22:12,653
He can't see you.

612
01:22:13,495 --> 01:22:15,554
She's pretty shaken up.
- Is she?

613
01:22:16,498 --> 01:22:17,624
I mean, is she hurt?

614
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:20,668
Jesus, she was running into traffic.
Let's get a doctor. Is there a doctor?

615
01:22:21,503 --> 01:22:22,629
She'll be fine.

616
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:27,572
I would never hurt her.

617
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:32,443
I love her.

618
01:22:32,714 --> 01:22:34,545
You brought him in?

619
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:36,584
He walked in looking for you.

620
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:39,678
He brought a pair of shoes.
He was worried about your feet.

621
01:22:46,528 --> 01:22:49,691
I believe your husband has
the potential for violence.

622
01:22:50,732 --> 01:22:52,700
I believe he's unpredictable.

623
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:55,600
But is he a murderer?

624
01:22:57,572 --> 01:22:58,698
I don't know.

625
01:23:00,475 --> 01:23:03,535
The truth is, what you two have been
doing together was consensual.

626
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:07,548
You said it yourself.

627
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:10,448
You liked it.

628
01:23:30,605 --> 01:23:32,470
Can you close the blinds?

629
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:48,484
I won't be able to keep him
for more than a few hours.

630
01:23:51,526 --> 01:23:53,585
That's as much of a window
I can give you.

631
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:57,596
You're accusing a hero and
you have absolutely no evidence.

632
01:24:07,809 --> 01:24:09,572
Deborah?

633
01:24:12,647 --> 01:24:14,512
Alice, what's
happened to you?

634
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:17,709
I'm sorry.
I'm not crazy. I just...

635
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:20,521
I went to the police station but
they wouldn't believe me...

636
01:24:20,755 --> 01:24:23,724
Then he came in and he brought my
shoes and he thought was nuts.

637
01:24:24,559 --> 01:24:27,528
I know he's your brother but
you were her friend, too.

638
01:24:28,763 --> 01:24:31,732
You remember when you said that
you were either with him or not?

639
01:24:32,567 --> 01:24:34,694
Well, I'm not...
I'm trying to understand...

640
01:24:34,769 --> 01:24:36,737
I just...
wanna ask...

641
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:43,635
Was Françoise with
someone else?

642
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:51,652
Yes.

643
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:57,751
It wasn't an accident.
She left him...

644
01:24:59,594 --> 01:25:00,754
...so he killed her.

645
01:25:09,871 --> 01:25:10,838
Maybe.

646
01:25:20,748 --> 01:25:22,807
This is the anchor that we used.

647
01:25:24,652 --> 01:25:26,620
It's made of titanium,
but the important thing is...

648
01:25:26,754 --> 01:25:28,813
...it can hold two
thousand falling pounds.

649
01:25:29,657 --> 01:25:32,820
I've got a friend in Katmandu who sent
me an anchor they're making locally...

650
01:25:33,661 --> 01:25:34,821
...with the wrong material.

651
01:25:35,763 --> 01:25:38,630
This is what happened with
just seventy five pounds.

652
01:25:39,767 --> 01:25:41,564
Maybe you're right.

653
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:43,797
Adam could have switched the
anchors for Françoise's group.

654
01:25:49,777 --> 01:25:51,642
He killed them.

655
01:26:29,817 --> 01:26:31,876
Leave him, Alice.
I know him.

656
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:35,687
You have to leave him
for your own good.

657
01:26:36,925 --> 01:26:39,894
Deborah, it's not the only time.

658
01:26:40,828 --> 01:26:41,852
What?

659
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:44,694
I think that he was with
a woman, Adele Blanchard.

660
01:26:44,832 --> 01:26:46,891
And think that she was gonna leave
him to go back to her husband.

661
01:26:47,735 --> 01:26:49,703
But
think that he killed her.

662
01:26:50,939 --> 01:26:52,907
Adele was never gonna
go back to Michael.

663
01:26:53,741 --> 01:26:54,901
Everyone knew
their marriage was over.

664
01:26:57,745 --> 01:26:58,905
I read her letters.

665
01:26:59,847 --> 01:27:01,906
She ended it with Adam.

666
01:27:04,752 --> 01:27:08,813
I think that... that she's there.

667
01:27:09,857 --> 01:27:10,915
What?

668
01:27:13,928 --> 01:27:16,897
I went to the police. They won't do
anything, they need evidence.

669
01:27:18,866 --> 01:27:21,835
I think he buried her here,
at St. Edmundís.

670
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:24,838
I need you to help me find her.

671
01:27:26,774 --> 01:27:28,742
Do you wanna go with me?

672
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:43,948
I have a confession to make.

673
01:27:46,794 --> 01:27:47,954
I sent you those notes.

674
01:27:49,797 --> 01:27:52,857
I know about my brother's violence.
I've seen it.

675
01:27:56,904 --> 01:27:58,963
I should've done more, but...
There's no excuse...

676
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:03,875
But he scares me.

677
01:28:08,916 --> 01:28:10,781
I'm glad you got away
from him, Alice.

678
01:28:13,021 --> 01:28:14,989
You'll be okay now.

679
01:29:53,855 --> 01:29:55,015
- Can I take that?
- Yeah, sure.

680
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:00,020
I think it's here.

681
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:03,929
He took the pictures
just by the angel.

682
01:30:47,041 --> 01:30:48,906
Oh my God!

683
01:30:49,143 --> 01:30:50,110
Deborah.

684
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:25,009
Deborah!

685
01:31:30,952 --> 01:31:32,920
She didn't have to die.

686
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:39,092
If only she'd told me
she was going back to Michael.

687
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,160
I gave her one, too.

688
01:31:49,103 --> 01:31:51,162
She thought it was beautiful,
just like you did.

689
01:31:52,106 --> 01:31:53,971
Why did you to this?

690
01:31:54,208 --> 01:31:55,971
Why did you do this?

691
01:32:00,047 --> 01:32:03,107
Who do you think gave him his first
piece of silk? He was just fifteen.

692
01:32:03,951 --> 01:32:05,919
I'm talking about fucking, Alice!

693
01:32:07,955 --> 01:32:10,116
That's right.
We fucked right here!

694
01:32:17,965 --> 01:32:19,125
Adam is mine.

695
01:32:19,967 --> 01:32:21,127
He's mine!

696
01:32:37,985 --> 01:32:39,043
Why?!

697
01:32:40,087 --> 01:32:44,046
I was never yours.
We were kids. Kids.

698
01:32:47,194 --> 01:32:49,958
It's over.
It's all over.

699
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,160
Alice?

700
01:32:58,072 --> 01:32:59,164
Oh, my God.

701
01:33:17,024 --> 01:33:18,048
Adam.

702
01:34:03,237 --> 01:34:05,102
She and I...

703
01:34:09,343 --> 01:34:11,311
We used to come
here together.

704
01:34:18,119 --> 01:34:20,280
I just thought
you had to trust me.

705
01:35:08,235 --> 01:35:10,100
And that's how it ended.

706
01:35:11,138 --> 01:35:15,199
Yet, not a day goes by without at
least one thought about the passion.

707
01:35:16,343 --> 01:35:18,208
Maybe was so
blinded by it...

708
01:35:19,146 --> 01:35:22,115
that missed all the clues
to his past.

709
01:35:32,393 --> 01:35:34,224
I often wonder...

710
01:35:34,295 --> 01:35:38,163
what would have happened if
I hadn't looked up that morning.

711
01:35:48,309 --> 01:35:51,278
Two years later,
I saw him once more.

712
01:36:30,184 --> 01:36:31,344
I don't know.

713
01:36:32,286 --> 01:36:36,245
Maybe a flatlander like me
can't live at that altitude.

714
01:36:38,292 --> 01:36:41,261
Maybe it never would have been
possible to sustain what we had.

715
01:36:43,397 --> 01:36:45,160
Maybe.

716
01:36:47,201 --> 01:36:49,260
Well, that's what
I tell myself...
