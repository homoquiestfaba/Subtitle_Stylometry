<b>Durante una visita nocturna

00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,903
Right.

9
00:05:00,023 --> 00:05:01,505
I understand, sir, but...

10
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:04,470
But there are many
variables such markets.

11
00:05:04,844 --> 00:05:07,196
If we want to transfer...

12
00:05:07,316 --> 00:05:10,535
part of what was left your account.

13
00:05:11,205 --> 00:05:13,099
Understand.

14
00:05:13,518 --> 00:05:16,769
Yes, sir.
I know Christmas is coming.

15

Forget, Mr. Dean, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

17
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:25,387
We developed the investments
As I could.

18
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:29,351
It is because of bad
economic situation.

19
00:05:30,053 --> 00:05:33,053
Hello?
Mr. Dean?

20
00:05:35,054 --> 00:05:36,054
Damn!

21
00:05:40,137 --> 00:05:41,983
You lost?

22
00:05:46,024 --> 00:05:48,608
It tastes like shit.

23
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,889
- Hey, is not your fault.
- Whose is it?

24
00:05:56,138 --> 00:05:57,560
I never knew this guy.

25
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,897
I just traded you some figures.

26
00:06:00,263 --> 00:06:01,790

27
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,867
Everyone is broke.
Stop whine.

Can be to get my day off.

29
00:06:07,664 --> 00:06:10,165
Yes, but then you have
lost the opportunity.

30
00:06:10,285 --> 00:06:12,221
What do you mean?

31
00:06:14,914 --> 00:06:17,462
- What?
- Is her last day.

32
00:06:17,582 --> 00:06:19,866
- And resigned?
- That's how I heard.

33
00:06:19,986 --> 00:06:21,101
- No.
- Yes.

34
00:06:21,221 --> 00:06:23,360
So I, not being a fool.
Go and ask for a meeting.

35
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,400
I already tried.

36
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,334
- I said.
- Yes, and how you asked that to Exit?

37
00:06:31,454 --> 00:06:34,453
I asked if you want
we are gathered here.

38
00:06:34,573 --> 00:06:36,797
Do you întruniþi?
What is it? Witch?

39
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:40,398
- I do not know why I said that.
- He needs someone...

40
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:43,729
- That's how I came.
- Is difficult.

41
00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:46,433
- You had good intentions.
- Thank you, buddy.

42
00:06:46,553 --> 00:06:48,189
Pleasure.

43
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,653
Come on, do not delay.
Go and talk to her.

44
00:06:50,773 --> 00:06:53,395
- I can not.
- Why?

45
00:06:54,124 --> 00:06:55,539
That boa and I left them home.

46
00:06:55,805 --> 00:06:57,788
- Not again.
- Yes.

47
00:06:57,908 --> 00:07:00,168
- I left them in the closet.
- Near the night shirt?

48
00:07:00,361 --> 00:07:04,131
Right. Rather we
covered as to them warm.

49
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:07,611
That's good.
As a male penguin.

50
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:09,571
- As a male penguin?
- Yes.

51
00:07:10,127 --> 00:07:12,866
- I do not know what that means.
- There's something funny.

52
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,417
- See you Monday.
- What about the Christmas party?

53
00:07:18,408 --> 00:07:20,357
Not tell me that.
We have a good time.

54
00:07:20,585 --> 00:07:23,390
We have a good time,
just looking at TV.

55
00:07:23,672 --> 00:07:27,656
And hookers. TV with hookers.
What this is about.

56
00:07:27,776 --> 00:07:30,201
That's how life is, David.

57
00:07:31,146 --> 00:07:35,121
- I just want to go home.
- You said that you come.

58
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,545
's crazy, Corey.

59
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:39,459
There are many taxis there...

60
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:41,913
If you would give me some money,
and lead to a wherever they want.

61
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:43,425
- Really!
- I swear.

62
00:07:43,545 --> 00:07:45,467
Super. The problem is that,

63
00:07:45,587 --> 00:07:48,502
if it does not go far
you will be lost forever.

64
00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:50,404
Life is a series of choices, pal.

65
00:07:50,524 --> 00:07:53,031
Good or bad, are better
unless you will not take any.

66
00:07:53,788 --> 00:07:56,068
Sure you read that somewhere.

67
00:07:56,188 --> 00:07:58,218
No, I do not read.

68
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,552
Right.

69
00:08:00,811 --> 00:08:03,959
- I will come.
- That said, and I.

70
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,870
evening will be a great brother.
Feel it.

71
00:08:07,143 --> 00:08:09,741
Not going to smoke a marijuana?

72
00:08:28,505 --> 00:08:31,138
Deliberately ordered pizza with
three minutes before midnight.

73
00:08:31,421 --> 00:08:33,010
- On New Year.
- Yes.

74
00:08:33,385 --> 00:08:35,590
What do this year again?

75
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,569
I want to finish my story.

76
00:08:37,689 --> 00:08:39,974
Steps tele grab you by then.

77
00:08:40,094 --> 00:08:43,159
You makeup, Jerry?
Arãþi another person.

78
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,737
Other person, not like it.

79
00:08:45,857 --> 00:08:48,286
- Where were we?
- Talking about pizza...

80
00:08:48,406 --> 00:08:50,764
. Anyway.
Three minutes have passed...

81
00:08:50,884 --> 00:08:54,060
I entered the new year
and 10 minutes later...

82
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,182
I heard knocking at the door...

83
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:58,812
And finally, we know the stories end.

84
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,192
Good. Still a good from Jerry.

85
00:09:02,312 --> 00:09:04,693
Jerry, today you're in shape.

86
00:09:04,813 --> 00:09:07,152
Have to get to this level.

87
00:09:07,272 --> 00:09:09,928
Pizza boy was and I said...

88
00:09:10,048 --> 00:09:14,121
I would have to pay.
I ordered last year.

89
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,008
- And you paid?
- What?

90
00:09:23,413 --> 00:09:27,148
- Pizza, you pay it?
- No, I heard first.

91
00:09:27,268 --> 00:09:28,990
I just wondered so, of empathy.

92
00:09:29,272 --> 00:09:32,085
I think I have not pursued.

93
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:33,743
Anyway...

94
00:09:39,414 --> 00:09:42,004
I'll bring some up and erveþele.

95
00:09:55,454 --> 00:09:57,999
- Hi, Emily.
- Hello, David.

96
00:09:58,119 --> 00:09:59,572
Want some?

97
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:01,991
I came to say goodbye.

98
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,740
Yes, I heard.

99
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,274
I heard go?

100
00:10:05,394 --> 00:10:08,481
, Corey said, you found another job.

101
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:11,426
Yes, I have found.
I meant that I left...

102
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,310
anyway.

103
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:17,054
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

104
00:10:17,174 --> 00:10:18,300
Rather you need a change, I suppose.

105
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:23,029
Yes, I shoot probably how far to go.

106
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:25,769
- Yes, I know it is.
- Yes.

107
00:10:30,404 --> 00:10:34,606
- It's a great party.
- Yes, it's great. Wonderful.

108
00:10:38,849 --> 00:10:43,140
- I better go.
- Glad I saw.

109
00:10:43,368 --> 00:10:47,111
And I. Thanks for the drink.
Intent.

110
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:49,157
I had already.

111
00:10:50,714 --> 00:10:54,862
- Maybe I'll see you later.
- Well.

112
00:10:54,983 --> 00:10:57,342
- Well. Pa.
- Pa.

113
00:11:03,244 --> 00:11:07,124
Maybe see you later.
Sounds good.

114
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,636
Emily!

115
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,551
Forgotten your hat.

116
00:11:26,148 --> 00:11:29,298
- You...
- Yes, it's not mine.

117
00:11:29,418 --> 00:11:33,362
- Damn, I stole a hat?
- Yes, I like that.

118
00:11:33,482 --> 00:11:36,911
Consider it as a gift from the
that owns.

119
00:11:37,145 --> 00:11:38,883
Not go very far.

120
00:11:39,003 --> 00:11:42,057
My office is a few
streets distance...

121
00:11:43,127 --> 00:11:45,974
Would you like to
have dinner sometime?

122
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:52,402
- No, it does not matter. I understand.
- No, no. I'd like.

123
00:11:52,522 --> 00:11:53,972
I'm sorry.

124
00:11:55,152 --> 00:11:58,630
- I think you are agitated.
- Why?

125
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,408
- All these items. That talk.
- Really?

126
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:08,683
- I have spoken many times...
- Yes, at work.

127
00:12:08,803 --> 00:12:12,122
You called the office and asked me
something balance of payments...

128
00:12:12,242 --> 00:12:14,643
But that's all.

129
00:12:15,588 --> 00:12:17,986
I cared for the balance of payments.

130
00:12:18,364 --> 00:12:21,728
- Seriously?
- Yes.

131
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,261
- Damn! I lost.
- Why do not you take me?

132
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:32,209
Live far from town.
Very far.

133
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:36,425
You to freeze here.
I'll go, right?

134
00:12:36,545 --> 00:12:39,480
Seriously? It would be great.
Thank you.

135
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,089
Pleasure. Wine in a minute.

136
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:45,219
Well, you wait.

137
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:47,809
David would probably have to go back
cap.

138
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:51,283
Why do not I look good with purple?

139
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,753
Right back.

140
00:12:57,274 --> 00:13:01,470
And tiaþi that tequila is a fruit...

141
00:13:01,775 --> 00:13:04,172
resembles the blackberry?

142
00:13:04,911 --> 00:13:07,222
I go.
Nice weekend, brothers.

143
00:13:07,342 --> 00:13:09,592
Already?
Drink a little.

144
00:13:09,712 --> 00:13:12,008
Emily go home.

145
00:13:12,128 --> 00:13:14,450
View, did not want to live.

146
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,186
- See you Monday.
- Good luck, buddy.

147
00:13:17,306 --> 00:13:18,979
Congratulations, amorezule.

148
00:13:20,349 --> 00:13:22,146
Thank you.

149
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,236
Do?

150
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:27,710
Ie they do, leave?

151
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:31,118
- I go.
- And I'm at home.

152
00:13:31,238 --> 00:13:33,461
Can not get a taxi?

153
00:13:33,787 --> 00:13:36,609
Not have money to me.

154
00:13:37,644 --> 00:13:39,078
Here...

155
00:13:39,722 --> 00:13:41,819
Boys, I can borrow some money?

156
00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:43,813
Can go with you.

157
00:13:44,341 --> 00:13:46,398
Thi
I said that I will go home on Emily.

158
00:13:46,518 --> 00:13:48,141
- But to me and the road.
- Corey...

159
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:51,941
- Do you take only 10 minutes.
- She lives on the other side.

160
00:13:52,307 --> 00:13:55,141
To me and not just walking, right?

161
00:13:55,966 --> 00:13:57,093
Right.

162
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,946
- Come on.
- Fri.

163
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:05,467
- See you, guys.
- To make sure it's not poisoned.

164
00:14:05,587 --> 00:14:07,808

Leave it on my desk, Jerry.

171

Yes. Jerry drugs again, buddy.

174

Safety. Do you, remember that
of drinking codeine syrup?

175
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,762
Do you, remember that I did
"Beth" for eight months?

176
00:14:51,882 --> 00:14:55,316

Corey, is 1.00 at night.
No other reason...

260
00:21:20,348 --> 00:21:23,068

empty parking lot?

261
00:21:23,188 --> 00:21:24,353
Same reason and we are here.

262
00:21:24,473 --> 00:21:26,549

- What was that?
- I do not know.

266

00:22:24,338 --> 00:22:27,064
She sits and looks at us.

280
00:22:29,622 --> 00:22:32,273
Maybe it's homeless.
Yes, probably.

281
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,779
Give something and get out of here.

282
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:38,910

Something like an elevator, which
to link here.

300
00:24:50,457 --> 00:24:53,446
Must be something
something to attract attention.

301
00:24:53,566 --> 00:24:57,456
- What? There's no one there.
- The guy came with a dog.

302
00:24:57,576 --> 00:25:00,086
And you saw what happened.

303
00:25:01,404 --> 00:25:03,417
Why not come here?

304
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,937
Not know. It may not have the card.

305
00:25:06,057 --> 00:25:07,697
And why would it stop?

306
00:25:07,817 --> 00:25:10,035
We need a device alarm, right?

307
00:25:10,155 --> 00:25:12,340
Think that has something like a dog?

308
00:25:12,782 --> 00:25:15,577
- He checked it?
- How to know?

309
00:25:15,697 --> 00:25:18,374
. I did it.
Have to do something.

310
00:25:22,286 --> 00:25:23,740
Where are my keys?

311
00:25:24,469 --> 00:25:25,819
Here.

312
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,505

00:25:41,816 --> 00:25:43,812
Goes to my machine.

317
00:26:26,186 --> 00:26:27,601
Where to go?

318
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:31,554
- Get out?
- No. I'm not sure.

319
00:26:36,716 --> 00:26:39,083
Damn!
Coming from behind.

320
00:26:39,915 --> 00:26:43,049
- Go?
- I do not know.

321
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:52,729
Damn!

322
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:56,413
Are you sure she is your purse?

323
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,064
- On the front seat?
- Yes.

324
00:26:58,184 --> 00:26:59,792
- No.

325
00:26:59,912 --> 00:27:01,961
Way to the front, are
halfway to the car.

326
00:27:02,081 --> 00:27:04,053
And the other half?

327
00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:08,282
Has a gun.

328
00:27:08,551 --> 00:27:10,711
. If you have used it before.

329
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:13,076
Maybe the window is antiglonþ.

330
00:27:13,196 --> 00:27:14,496
Not.

331
00:27:15,044 --> 00:27:16,555
Maybe Corey, is right.

332
00:27:16,891 --> 00:27:18,056
Better to wait.

333
00:27:18,176 --> 00:27:20,480
Parking soon will throng.

334
00:27:20,736 --> 00:27:23,076
Sun will exit in a few hours.
We will be lucky if it...

335
00:27:23,196 --> 00:27:25,507
will die from the cold by then.

336
00:27:25,864 --> 00:27:29,191
- Is madness!
- David?

337
00:27:29,311 --> 00:27:31,297
Is very dangerous.

338
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:32,917
Okay?

339
00:27:36,131 --> 00:27:37,693
- What?
- God!

340
00:27:37,813 --> 00:27:39,666
What was that?
What happened?

341
00:27:39,786 --> 00:27:41,643
Power failure.

342
00:27:45,117 --> 00:27:47,773
Warming goes.
He stopped and warming.

343
00:27:47,893 --> 00:27:50,593
No, no, no!

344
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,270

do?

348
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,639
Maybe the glass is
connected to an alarm.

349
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:12,062
If you break it, you can enter!

350
00:28:12,182 --> 00:28:14,570
Well, then what?
What?

351
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:17,865
- What do you think?
- What?

352
00:28:21,538 --> 00:28:23,822
Stop it!
Wait!

353
00:28:24,823 --> 00:28:28,494
There is a fire alarm.
Corey, where Thi-is lighter?

354
00:28:28,614 --> 00:28:29,514

355
00:28:43,899 --> 00:28:45,199

00:29:06,994 --> 00:29:09,226
- What is?
- Returns.

359
00:29:12,133 --> 00:29:15,778
- Get out.
- We have not seen!

360
00:29:22,685 --> 00:29:24,942
Very cold.

361
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:40,237
Corey, how many money
you have in mind?

362
00:29:40,357 --> 00:29:41,723
Know. Why?

363
00:29:45,171 --> 00:29:47,292
You do not want to give him money?

364
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:49,645
Just killed someone, Corey.

365
00:29:56,097 --> 00:29:59,175
Right. If we give them $ 500,
may 1000, can that be suficienþi.

366
00:29:59,295 --> 00:30:00,897
David, my cards do not work.

367
00:30:01,017 --> 00:30:02,895
Damn! A and the e.

368
00:30:04,729 --> 00:30:08,566
Here... Take them.

369
00:30:08,966 --> 00:30:10,324
Right.

370
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:24,110
Stay. If you damaged cards,
us how you got here?

371
00:30:25,095 --> 00:30:26,106
What do you mean?

372
00:30:26,226 --> 00:30:29,566
If magnetic tape is broken,
the way it's said...

373
00:30:29,686 --> 00:30:31,926
of passing the alarm system?

374
00:30:32,783 --> 00:30:34,422
Who cares?

375
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,904
Tell me that you wanted to get rid
cheaper.

376
00:30:38,272 --> 00:30:39,895
Your card is good, right?

377
00:30:40,016 --> 00:30:42,207
You wanted to get rid
and cheaper to pay us.

378
00:30:53,382 --> 00:30:54,682
Not.

379
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:42,590
I throw this away from the door.

380
00:31:43,832 --> 00:31:46,720
If you go after them, we run
other side.

381
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,091
- OK.
- No.

382
00:31:49,211 --> 00:31:51,576
- What?
- And if they become many?

383
00:31:51,696 --> 00:31:53,735
- What do you mean?
- What?

384
00:31:54,001 --> 00:31:55,282
Him.

385
00:31:55,402 --> 00:31:57,675
If there is one?

386
00:31:57,795 --> 00:32:00,370
- <i>He's just out.</i>
- <i>Do not know that. </ I></i>

387
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,977
<i>Neither you. </ I></i>

388
00:32:03,886 --> 00:32:06,749
<i>Emily is right.
's too risky. </ i></i>

389
00:32:08,673 --> 00:32:10,373
<i>I go. </ i></i>

390
00:32:11,069 --> 00:32:14,354
- No, I draw here.
- Not draw anything.

391
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:17,123
If you reach the car, can help.

392
00:33:03,374 --> 00:33:05,215
Here are $ 5000.

393
00:33:05,805 --> 00:33:07,976
Plus a watch and a pair of earrings.

394
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:10,233
Are all yours.
Okay?

395
00:33:10,353 --> 00:33:12,721
Please. Let us just to leave.

396
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:17,200
We will not tell anyone.
Have not seen thi face.

397
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,979
You can take and make you invisible.

398
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:23,445
And such would not be
nothing happened, right?

399
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:26,712
's all right?

400
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,823
We have pretenþii. Yours.

401
00:35:07,211 --> 00:35:09,802
- No, David!
- Fast!

402
00:35:12,591 --> 00:35:14,049
Come quickly!

403
00:35:25,249 --> 00:35:28,257
- Are you OK?
- A cut wires.

404
00:35:53,598 --> 00:35:55,297
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

405
00:35:55,417 --> 00:35:57,682
- You need it.
- And you.

406
00:35:57,802 --> 00:35:58,802
Take it.

407
00:36:16,032 --> 00:36:17,080
Do?

408
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,660
Damn!

409
00:38:27,592 --> 00:38:29,551
What do you think is there?

410
00:38:30,445 --> 00:38:33,445
- Cement.
- Damn.

411
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:35,863
Thi Let's see the card.

412
00:38:36,187 --> 00:38:38,644
- I did everything I could.
- I know.

413
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:44,305
- Here.
- What is it?

414
00:38:44,425 --> 00:38:45,823
5908.

415
00:38:45,943 --> 00:38:48,498
5908, 5908.
8095, 8095.

416
00:38:50,201 --> 00:38:51,959
- Wait, is inversely bath.
- I know.

417
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,708
I heard that if you type pin
reverse...

418
00:38:55,828 --> 00:38:57,260
ATM immediately alert the police.

419
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,624
A panic code...

420
00:38:58,744 --> 00:38:59,766
If you're robbed.

421
00:38:59,886 --> 00:39:02,711
Nonsense.
's Just a story.

422
00:39:02,831 --> 00:39:04,052
How do you know?

423
00:39:04,172 --> 00:39:08,290
If the pin was 4224, when were lost.

424
00:39:09,033 --> 00:39:12,395
- Worth a try, right?
- Yes.

425
00:39:18,778 --> 00:39:20,620
Where did he go?

426
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:23,404
Have you seen starting?

427
00:39:23,524 --> 00:39:25,109
When I returned, was not there.

428
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:28,587
- Have you seen starting?
- Who cares?

429
00:39:28,823 --> 00:39:30,407
Could be and our chance.
Let go.

430
00:39:30,527 --> 00:39:31,638
And if you return?

431
00:39:31,758 --> 00:39:34,496
Out more safely than here.

432
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,006
But we are still alive.
He is not.

433
00:39:38,368 --> 00:39:40,657
This means nothing.

434
00:39:41,841 --> 00:39:43,231
Corey...

435
00:39:44,172 --> 00:39:45,944
I do it, please.

436
00:39:49,289 --> 00:39:52,235
If you want to come here, maybe.

437
00:39:52,355 --> 00:39:53,782
Not know that.

438
00:39:53,902 --> 00:39:56,078
Must use a door

439
00:39:56,198 --> 00:39:58,746
can break one of these
windows with a stone...

440
00:39:58,866 --> 00:40:00,604
And can come directly to us!

441
00:40:00,724 --> 00:40:03,152
- Then why did not it?
- I do not know!

442
00:40:04,407 --> 00:40:05,907
Know.

443
00:40:08,733 --> 00:40:11,514
<i>Card was retained.
Contact customer service for recovery. </ I></i>

444
00:40:11,634 --> 00:40:13,134
Damn!

445
00:40:15,211 --> 00:40:17,368
He retained the card.

446
00:40:20,197 --> 00:40:22,399
Why do this?

447
00:40:24,074 --> 00:40:27,672
- I do not know.
- Can I do something?

448
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:29,292
What?

449
00:40:34,843 --> 00:40:37,818
But that guy today, at work?

450
00:40:39,461 --> 00:40:42,468
- What type?
- One who þipa to you on the phone.

451
00:40:43,435 --> 00:40:45,985
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

452
00:40:46,105 --> 00:40:48,027
Nonsense.
I've lost half the shares...

453
00:40:48,147 --> 00:40:50,227
Before Christmas, right?

454
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:52,784
I know, Corey.
But this guy is not he.

455
00:40:53,005 --> 00:40:54,285
- How do you know?
- Because I know.

456
00:40:54,405 --> 00:40:56,266
You said yourself
that you never seen before.

457
00:40:56,386 --> 00:40:58,470
, I have not seen.
But this guy had over 60 years.

458
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,938
And who tells me that not one
of thousands of people,

459
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:02,127
that annoy you every day.

460
00:41:02,247 --> 00:41:04,171
I've lost pensión money?

461
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:07,989
Emily, this guy does not,
because I lost money.

462
00:41:08,442 --> 00:41:12,077
If it were so, what would be
the guy who killed and walk the dog?

463
00:41:12,197 --> 00:41:15,560
- It makes no sense.
- Is however a reason.

464
00:41:21,095 --> 00:41:22,795
Sense.

465
00:41:23,908 --> 00:41:26,348
I think we are.

466
00:41:32,183 --> 00:41:35,664
- Do not feel my fingers.
- Neither.

467
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:41,103
- As if...
- Give me your hand.

468
00:41:45,497 --> 00:41:46,895
Corey...

469
00:41:51,754 --> 00:41:54,359
Rub hands... a and a.

470
00:42:04,014 --> 00:42:06,206
What's this?

471
00:42:07,046 --> 00:42:09,038
- A car.
- E police.

472
00:42:10,116 --> 00:42:12,197
Same patrol, that went before.

473
00:42:13,903 --> 00:42:17,133
Sees us, im exit as well?

474
00:42:28,044 --> 00:42:31,217
- It's a security patrol.
- So what?

475
00:42:31,337 --> 00:42:33,081
Sure no weapon.

476
00:42:33,201 --> 00:42:34,892
Can stop this guy.

477
00:42:35,012 --> 00:42:37,240
- Where is?
- I do not know.

478
00:42:57,422 --> 00:42:59,878
- Contact the Assistance police!
- What?

479
00:43:00,752 --> 00:43:03,837
- Contact the Assistance police.
- Are you okay?

480
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:06,439
Take care!

481
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:12,480
Tried to kill us!

482
00:43:14,802 --> 00:43:16,367
Jesus!

483
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:26,667
Emily, are you okay?

484
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:29,696
Emily?

485
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:32,392
Leave me alone.

486
00:44:32,512 --> 00:44:35,614
Please, leave me alone.

487
00:44:42,701 --> 00:44:44,445
- We must move about.
- I know.

488
00:44:44,565 --> 00:44:46,735
- Someone has to escape.
- No.

489
00:44:46,855 --> 00:44:49,207
At least one of us can escape.

490
00:44:49,434 --> 00:44:50,858
And who will be the bait? You?

491
00:44:50,978 --> 00:44:52,867
Because I'm sure,
he will not go there.

492
00:44:52,987 --> 00:44:56,269
- What is the plan?
- What?

493
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:59,350
Plan.

494
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:04,114
Know. I believe that we have a plan

495
00:45:05,082 --> 00:45:07,507
- is disoriented.
- I know.

496
00:45:08,308 --> 00:45:09,670
We can not stay long here.

497
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,053
Says.

498
00:46:57,562 --> 00:46:59,350
This is...

499
00:47:06,681 --> 00:47:08,981
Now what?

500
00:47:12,098 --> 00:47:13,834
Leaving.

501
00:47:15,076 --> 00:47:17,889
Need to call the police.

502
00:47:18,393 --> 00:47:21,037
. One could do.

503
00:47:21,157 --> 00:47:23,585
Get out of here first.

504
00:47:27,754 --> 00:47:29,601
You okay?

505
00:47:35,274 --> 00:47:37,574
You okay?

506
00:47:43,998 --> 00:47:46,336
Of...?
How e.?

507
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:49,478
What did you do?
What did you do?

508
00:47:50,476 --> 00:47:52,809
We will kill!

509
00:47:53,457 --> 00:47:56,123
- Who is?
- I do not know.

510
00:47:56,827 --> 00:47:58,268
If he is there, who's this?

511
00:47:58,388 --> 00:48:00,254
Not know, do not know!

512
00:48:03,139 --> 00:48:06,151
- What are you doing?
- Looking to see if the phone has.

513
00:48:24,035 --> 00:48:25,296
Who is?

514
00:48:27,278 --> 00:48:29,881
Harold Westburke.

515
00:48:30,494 --> 00:48:32,917
Frederick Street No 8.

516
00:48:34,387 --> 00:48:36,725
Doing here?

517
00:48:38,067 --> 00:48:40,624
Wanted to use the ATM.

518
00:48:40,744 --> 00:48:45,210
. We do not know
anything about this guy.

519
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:48,320
Can you help the idiot out there.

520
00:48:48,605 --> 00:48:51,085
Has wife and children.

521
00:48:52,206 --> 00:48:54,494
Nonsense.

522
00:48:55,708 --> 00:48:57,932
Was administrator.

523
00:48:58,438 --> 00:49:01,073
Go to work.

524
00:50:34,944 --> 00:50:37,229
Stops I got to you.

525
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:39,715
Do not breathe it.

526
00:50:40,301 --> 00:50:44,412
- Do not blame me.
- It's your fault.

527
00:50:44,949 --> 00:50:48,314
- Nobody is obliged to stop you.
- You are.

528
00:50:48,434 --> 00:50:50,266
Do nothing.

529
00:50:50,386 --> 00:50:53,158
- You could say no.
- I said no.

530
00:50:53,278 --> 00:50:56,719
Twice. But, as usual,
you have not given a damn.

531
00:50:57,564 --> 00:50:59,957
Not blame me.

532
00:51:00,673 --> 00:51:02,807
I think it's your fault.

533
00:51:02,927 --> 00:51:06,130
- My fault? How is my fault?
- Get out of my face!

534
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:08,174
- Fuck you!
- Încetaþi.

535
00:51:08,431 --> 00:51:10,426
I did that, right?

536
00:51:10,546 --> 00:51:12,495
Stops you!
Stops you!

537
00:51:14,401 --> 00:51:16,281
Stops you!

538
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:24,399
You did it!
You kill him!

539
00:51:24,519 --> 00:51:26,887
- Let me!
- You did it!

540
00:51:30,533 --> 00:51:34,363
- Has disappeared again.
- Is there somewhere.

541
00:51:35,482 --> 00:51:40,056
I was tired.
I'm tired of shit.

542
00:51:40,176 --> 00:51:44,253
I'm tired of hiding,
to wait for someone to save me!

543
00:51:44,373 --> 00:51:47,892
- Is our only option.
- Maybe yours.

544
00:51:48,012 --> 00:51:50,667
- What will you do?
- I leave out of here.

545
00:51:50,787 --> 00:51:56,742
- You sure you want to do this?
- Is one and we are three.

546
00:51:58,136 --> 00:52:01,112
Can not go there, Corey.

547
00:52:02,894 --> 00:52:04,594
Exit i.

548
00:52:04,995 --> 00:52:06,714
Not you.

549
00:52:07,739 --> 00:52:10,364
I do not care.

550
00:52:10,484 --> 00:52:13,296
I do not care if Stay
and muriþi, it's your choice.

551
00:52:13,416 --> 00:52:14,702
But I can not stay.
I finished.

552
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:16,298
Corey!

553
00:52:19,198 --> 00:52:21,636
Please do not leave, Corey.

554
00:52:27,457 --> 00:52:29,462
No longer wait.

555
00:52:30,674 --> 00:52:34,140
I exit Corey, come back!

556
00:52:35,672 --> 00:52:37,590
Come back!

557
00:52:49,692 --> 00:52:54,910
, David. I can not leave here!

558
00:53:20,573 --> 00:53:23,072
Corey, be careful!
Corey!

559
00:53:27,147 --> 00:53:29,335
- No, David!
- Let me out!

560
00:53:38,117 --> 00:53:41,333
- No, it's too late!
- Let me out!

561
00:53:45,699 --> 00:53:47,999
Please...

562
00:54:43,807 --> 00:54:46,288
That does not happen.

563
00:56:38,179 --> 00:56:39,737
Cap...

564
00:56:40,782 --> 00:56:43,425
I knew I was not yours.

565
00:56:43,731 --> 00:56:48,739
- I took the one seat.
- Seriously, why?

566
00:56:49,674 --> 00:56:52,267
- I was desperate.
- Why?

567
00:56:54,465 --> 00:56:57,525
To find a way as to not leave.

568
00:56:59,096 --> 00:57:02,541
I want you to be let go.

569
00:57:02,871 --> 00:57:06,110
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>
- <i>I have anything. </ I></i>

570
00:57:06,691 --> 00:57:10,768
- It had to be home.
- David.

571
00:57:11,322 --> 00:57:13,517
My fault.

572
00:57:14,133 --> 00:57:16,764
Blame us all.

573
00:57:18,177 --> 00:57:22,253
We are here for hours
trying to control...

574
00:57:22,587 --> 00:57:25,434
What happens to us.

575
00:57:26,094 --> 00:57:28,569
And wait for a reason.

576
00:57:29,608 --> 00:57:31,495
And then what?

577
00:57:32,356 --> 00:57:34,868
That we have not done
anything wrong...

578
00:57:34,988 --> 00:57:38,255
And somehow we had to protect?

579
00:57:41,067 --> 00:57:42,659
By whom?

580
00:57:44,409 --> 00:57:46,309
Police?

581
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:49,070
Alarms?

582
00:57:50,135 --> 00:57:56,035
Iconiþa that... the saints?

583
00:57:57,023 --> 00:57:59,415
However, it would not be here.

584
00:58:00,188 --> 00:58:02,538
<i>I could take a taxi. </ I></i>

585
00:58:02,797 --> 00:58:05,191
May not come to party.

586
00:58:06,118 --> 00:58:10,575
May not work at the company.

587
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:12,630
But I did.

588
00:58:12,888 --> 00:58:15,000
I did, I did all these things.

589
00:58:22,831 --> 00:58:28,799
And I did
million other things in between.

590
00:58:29,669 --> 00:58:33,617
And however,
life brought me here with you tonight.

591
00:58:33,737 --> 00:58:35,442
<i>So I... </ i></i>

592
00:58:38,724 --> 00:58:40,367
And I...

593
00:58:41,364 --> 00:58:43,211
and I...

594
00:58:43,331 --> 00:58:47,534
I thought, taking into
account the circumstances that.

595
00:58:49,388 --> 00:58:53,072
Dinner was a better choice.

596
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:31,754
- Lord.
- It's alive!

597
00:59:50,303 --> 00:59:51,452
Pick it up!

598
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:55,994
- The road is there.
- Need to get him inside.

599
01:00:02,169 --> 01:00:04,045
Grabe and up!

600
01:00:27,558 --> 01:00:30,366
Emily, how are you?
I need help.

601
01:00:37,276 --> 01:00:39,306
To rush.
Come.

602
01:00:41,216 --> 01:00:43,312
- I have to bind wounds.
- What?

603
01:00:43,432 --> 01:00:46,295
Any.
Bring me something.

604
01:00:49,928 --> 01:00:52,458
- Fast!
- Hold.

605
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:59,374
- What should I do?
- I do not know.

606
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:07,258
- Let it out?
- No, do not remove it.

607
01:01:07,378 --> 01:01:09,277
- Will be worse.
- No stops.

608
01:01:09,397 --> 01:01:10,936
Right.

609
01:01:15,451 --> 01:01:17,697
Come on, come on!

610
01:01:21,113 --> 01:01:22,639
Have to get him to hospital.

611
01:01:22,759 --> 01:01:24,470
- How?
- I do not know.

612
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:27,142
Otherwise, you will bleed to death.

613
01:01:29,566 --> 01:01:32,936
- No.
- Continue to press.

614
01:01:34,279 --> 01:01:36,772
- Where you going?
- Nowhere.

615
01:01:53,003 --> 01:01:54,103
Do?

616
01:01:54,369 --> 01:01:57,148
Alert police if it
is vandalized, right?

617
01:01:57,268 --> 01:01:58,451
Know.

618
01:01:58,571 --> 01:02:02,010
Something here we must be good.

619
01:02:12,461 --> 01:02:15,800
- I was inside block.
- What is?

620
01:02:18,505 --> 01:02:20,368
Emily, grab it!

621
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:24,106
Come on, buddy, stay with me
Look at me!

622
01:02:24,226 --> 01:02:26,042
All will go well.

623
01:02:30,326 --> 01:02:31,826
Damn!

624
01:02:59,547 --> 01:03:01,667
Have to pick it up.
Three.

625
01:03:01,787 --> 01:03:03,634
1, 2, 3.

626
01:03:04,115 --> 01:03:05,602
Come on!

627
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,591
Come up!

628
01:03:15,362 --> 01:03:18,297
Come on, buddy, you're to residents.

629
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:22,060
Try again, right?
Again.

630
01:03:26,021 --> 01:03:28,921
Can, dammit!

631
01:03:35,463 --> 01:03:38,457
There in the corner.
Pick least.

632
01:03:39,005 --> 01:03:41,666
There in the corner.
Forgive me, buddy.

633
01:03:41,863 --> 01:03:44,144
Put him in the corner there.

634
01:03:56,246 --> 01:03:58,676
Tries to drown.

635
01:03:58,925 --> 01:04:02,036
To drown us.
Let us freeze.

636
01:04:06,872 --> 01:04:09,835
- His cigarette!
- Lighter.

637
01:04:20,139 --> 01:04:22,254
Come on, buddy resist!

638
01:04:32,373 --> 01:04:34,128
Hold me like that!

639
01:04:40,648 --> 01:04:42,939
Me move!
Is not enough!

640
01:04:46,844 --> 01:04:48,544
Right.

641
01:04:49,023 --> 01:04:52,621
Find something to burn.
Anything is flammable.

642
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:13,775
Talk to me.
You find something?

643
01:05:34,083 --> 01:05:35,683
Well, great!

644
01:05:37,084 --> 01:05:40,701
- Well. Now.
- Stay there.

645
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:55,013
- Ready?
- Bring me and more.

646
01:05:55,133 --> 01:05:57,850
- Where?
- From there. Quickly.

647
01:06:07,537 --> 01:06:10,303
Give it to me.
Carefully.

648
01:06:12,235 --> 01:06:13,867
I try to activate it.

649
01:06:16,051 --> 01:06:18,378
- Are next to it?
- No.

650
01:06:18,964 --> 01:06:20,884
Too far.

651
01:06:23,892 --> 01:06:26,574
- Well, keeps me!
- Hold You!

652
01:06:28,402 --> 01:06:30,102
Reach.

653
01:06:31,332 --> 01:06:32,706
Damn!

654
01:06:33,244 --> 01:06:35,431
I'll try something else.

655
01:06:59,492 --> 01:07:02,364
David, come here.
Help me.

656
01:07:02,484 --> 01:07:05,182
- What are you doing?
- The fire goes out.

657
01:07:05,302 --> 01:07:07,209
I know, but wasting time.

658
01:07:07,561 --> 01:07:10,050
Take me on your shoulders
and you can get.

659
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:27,486
Give it to me!

660
01:07:29,748 --> 01:07:32,533
Right. Better.
I got it.

661
01:08:17,696 --> 01:08:21,118
Emily, look at me!
Not close your eyes, right?

662
01:08:21,238 --> 01:08:23,711
Close your eyes!
No, no!

663
01:08:24,247 --> 01:08:26,737
Resistant, Emily!
Resistant.

664
01:08:27,376 --> 01:08:31,324
! Look at me!
Please!

665
01:12:19,791 --> 01:12:22,151
Earth!
Down!

666
01:12:24,857 --> 01:12:27,314
Please!
There he is!

667
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:31,393
- What are you doing?
- The ground, now!

668
01:12:33,531 --> 01:12:37,952
What are you doing?
There he is!

669
01:12:40,683 --> 01:12:42,260
Please!

670
01:12:58,381 --> 01:13:00,511
What are you doing?
Not!

671
01:13:04,233 --> 01:13:07,380
He killed him! He killed him!

672
01:13:12,333 --> 01:13:14,846
Please, listen to me!

673
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:26,258
