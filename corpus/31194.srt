00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:49,711  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:458 Y2:500
Yes, sir<i>.</i> And you are?

112
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:52,998  X1:086 X2:632 Y1:458 Y2:529
-Boyd<i>.</i> The commander's expecting me<i>.</i>
-Follow me<i>.</i>

113
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,918  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:458 Y2:500
Commander's got a grip on things<i>.</i>

114
00:11:56,121 --> 00:11:58,351  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:458 Y2:534
l've seen mental wards
saner than this place<i>.</i>

115
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:22,870  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:458 Y2:495
Can we start over?

116
00:12:23,401 --> 00:12:26,120  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:458 Y2:500
Too late for first impressions<i>.</i> Sit<i>.</i>

117
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:37,034  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:458 Y2:534
This year alone, three complaints
filed against you for excessive force<i>.</i>

118
00:12:37,201 --> 00:12:39,396  X1:079 X2:638 Y1:458 Y2:495
This doesn't seem like a hero's welcome<i>.</i>

119
00:12:39,481 --> 00:12:42,075  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:458 Y2:534
You want to be welcomed?
Stay out of the headlines<i>.</i>

120
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,550  X1:137 X2:579 Y1:458 Y2:534
Around here,
there's no such thing as heroes<i>.</i>

121
00:12:44,641 --> 00:12:48,270  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:458 Y2:534
l've got community activists swearing
we treat everybody like criminals<i>...</i>

122
00:12:48,361 --> 00:12:50,795  X1:164 X2:556 Y1:458 Y2:534
<i>...</i>and criminals all swearing
they're altar boys<i>.</i>

123
00:12:50,881 --> 00:12:53,839  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:458 Y2:534
Maybe l was never an altar boy,
but the point is--

124
00:12:54,081 --> 00:12:57,312  X1:080 X2:637 Y1:458 Y2:534
The point is,
cops don't uphold the law by breaking it<i>.</i>

125
00:12:58,401 --> 00:13:01,074  X1:103 X2:616 Y1:458 Y2:534
Now, you got a problem in my house,
you come see me<i>.</i>

126
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:04,074  X1:149 X2:573 Y1:458 Y2:534
None of this Lone Ranger stuff
that l keep hearing about<i>.</i>

127
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:06,400  X1:226 X2:490 Y1:458 Y2:500
Are you listening?

128
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:09,120  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:458 Y2:529
lf l have a problem,
l'll come and see the commander<i>.</i>

129
00:13:09,201 --> 00:13:12,716  X1:100 X2:617 Y1:458 Y2:534
All that stuff with the Vice President?
A little water never hurt anybody<i>.</i>

130
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:16,271  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:458 Y2:534
But l am worried
about your discipline problem<i>.</i>

131
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:18,831  X1:064 X2:653 Y1:458 Y2:500
l was thinking about putting you on a desk<i>.</i>

132
00:13:19,201 --> 00:13:21,669  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:458 Y2:529
-l can't type<i>.</i>
-l have a better idea<i>.</i>

133
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,911  X1:063 X2:655 Y1:458 Y2:500
Something that will broaden your horizons<i>.</i>

134
00:13:27,921 --> 00:13:29,149  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:458 Y2:500
And then her dog<i>.</i>

135
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,509  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:458 Y2:500
Her dog gets so freaked out<i>...</i>

136
00:13:33,921 --> 00:13:37,231  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:458 Y2:495
<i>...</i>he takes this enormous shit<i>...</i>

137
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,750  X1:090 X2:628 Y1:458 Y2:500
<i>...</i>right in the middle of the living room<i>.</i>

138
00:13:42,961 --> 00:13:45,350  X1:082 X2:636 Y1:458 Y2:500
l chased that little bastard everywhere<i>...</i>

139
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:47,593  X1:159 X2:560 Y1:458 Y2:500
<i>...</i>until l finally cornered him<i>.</i>

140
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:50,115  X1:076 X2:642 Y1:458 Y2:500
l warned her not to buy a frigging poodle<i>.</i>

141
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:53,358  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:458 Y2:534
l never could have thrown
a German Shepherd out the window<i>.</i>

142
00:13:57,481 --> 00:13:58,630  X1:308 X2:410 Y1:458 Y2:500
Okay<i>.</i>

143
00:14:06,801 --> 00:14:08,154  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:458 Y2:495
That's it<i>.</i> Let it out<i>.</i>

144
00:14:08,241 --> 00:14:10,709  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:458 Y2:500
Okay? That's why we're here<i>.</i>

145
00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:14,470  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:458 Y2:534
To talk through our problems,
not to let it bottle up<i>.</i>

146
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:15,670  X1:308 X2:410 Y1:458 Y2:500
Okay<i>.</i>

147
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:19,278  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:458 Y2:534
And the rest of you,
l want you to dig down deep<i>...</i>

148
00:14:19,521 --> 00:14:21,796  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:458 Y2:500
<i>...</i>and ask yourself the question:

149
00:14:22,641 --> 00:14:26,031  X1:069 X2:649 Y1:458 Y2:500
Why are we mad and what are we mad at?

150
00:14:27,481 --> 00:14:28,880  X1:262 X2:456 Y1:458 Y2:500
Good<i>.</i> Okay<i>.</i>

151
00:14:30,481 --> 00:14:32,153  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:458 Y2:500
Who'd like to go next?

152
00:14:33,681 --> 00:14:34,796  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:458 Y2:500
Hey, everyone<i>.</i>

153

How are you?

154
00:14:35,881 --> 00:14:39,715  X1:083 X2:637 Y1:458 Y2:534
For those of you just tuning in, my name
is Henry Wayne, and l'm a rageaholic<i>.</i>

155
00:14:39,801 --> 00:14:42,759  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:458 Y2:534
You probably all recognize me
from my show, <i>Detroit A.M.</i>

156
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:47,674  X1:131 X2:585 Y1:458 Y2:534
You're probably wondering
what happened to my head here<i>.</i>

157
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,833  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:458 Y2:534
l know it's always something,
and l shouldn't lose my cool<i>.</i>

158
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:53,276  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:458 Y2:534
l was at Krispy Kreme,
picking up a twelve-pack<i>.</i>

159
00:14:53,361 --> 00:14:54,840  X1:249 X2:469 Y1:458 Y2:534
-And this guy--
-Okay<i>.</i>

160
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,635  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:458 Y2:500
l'm so sorry to interrupt you but<i>...</i>

161
00:14:58,561 --> 00:15:00,711  X1:077 X2:642 Y1:458 Y2:500
<i>...</i>l'm kind of looking for a fresh face next<i>.</i>

162
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:01,916  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:458 Y2:500
l've been sitting there<i>....</i>

00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,354  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:458 Y2:500
We'll get back to you<i>.</i>

164
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:06,239  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:458 Y2:534
l'm a ticking time bomb,
and l'm ready to implode<i>.</i>

165
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:07,754  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:458 Y2:500
Let's solve my problem<i>.</i>

166
00:15:08,161 --> 00:15:09,071  X1:281 X2:435 Y1:458 Y2:495
Sit down!

167
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:14,436  X1:308 X2:410 Y1:458 Y2:500

168
00:15:15,841 --> 00:15:17,638  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:458 Y2:500
So, who's it going to be?

169
00:15:20,241 --> 00:15:23,836  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:458 Y2:534
Mr<i>.</i> Boyd?
l believe that you were sent to us<i>...</i>

170
00:15:23,921 --> 00:15:26,276  X1:122 X2:596 Y1:458 Y2:495
<i>...</i>because of work-related stress<i>...</i>

171
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:28,631  X1:082 X2:637 Y1:458 Y2:500
<i>...</i>aggression towards authority figures<i>...</i>

172
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:31,759  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:458 Y2:500
<i>...</i>and an all-around lack of discipline<i>.</i>

173
00:15:31,921 --> 00:15:35,755  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:458 Y2:534
l'm fine<i>.</i> You can move on<i>.</i>
Other people want to say something<i>.</i>

174
00:15:35,921 --> 00:15:40,358  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:458 Y2:534
Mr<i>.</i> Boyd, denial is a classic symptom
of unhealthy rage<i>.</i>

175
00:15:40,561 --> 00:15:43,473  X1:084 X2:634 Y1:458 Y2:500
Okay? So why don't you just stand up<i>...</i>

176
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:46,479  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:458 Y2:500

177
00:16:03,521 --> 00:16:05,989  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:458 Y2:534
l'd like to make this clear:

178
00:16:06,481 --> 00:16:08,472  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:458 Y2:500
l'm a happy guy<i>.</i> You see this face?

179

181
00:16:34,441 --> 00:16:36,397  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:458 Y2:500
What am l, a shit magnet?

182
00:16:41,361 --> 00:16:43,113  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:458 Y2:500

187
00:16:54,121 --> 00:16:57,193  X1:111 X2:608 Y1:458 Y2:534
You want me to show you

194
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:15,278  X1:081 X2:637 Y1:458 Y2:534

206
00:18:21,161 --> 00:18:24,836  X1:089 X2:630 Y1:458 Y2:534

win a tough-men competition<i>.</i>

207
00:18:24,921 --> 00:18:27,993  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:458 Y2:534

208
00:18:28,201 --> 00:18:31,511  X1:118 X2:598 Y1:458 Y2:534

501
00:40:43,798 --> 00:40:45,550  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:458 Y2:500
So we got a twelve-block stretch<i>.</i>

611
00:49:21,478 --> 00:49:23,833  X1:082 X2:636 Y1:458 Y2:500
Either we call backup, or get out of here<i>.</i>

612
00:49:24,398 --> 00:49:26,070  X1:156 X2:562 Y1:458 Y2:500
What backup? We ain't here<i>.</i>

617
00:50:03,518 --> 00:50:05,509  X1:125 X2:594 Y1:458 Y2:500
Before you even get into all that<i>...</i>

618

619
00:50:08,518 --> 00:50:11,749  X1:123 X2:597 Y1:458 Y2:529

624
00:50:20,398 --> 00:50:22,070  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:458 Y2:500
Are you deaf or something?

625
00:50:22,278 --> 00:50:25,076  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:458 Y2:534

628
00:50:30,558 --> 00:50:33,595  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:458 Y2:529

631
00:50:37,918 --> 00:50:40,557  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:458 Y2:534
Did he take over your business
when you went away?

632
00:50:40,638 --> 00:50:42,515  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:458 Y2:500
l don't know what you talking about<i>.</i>

633
00:50:42,598 --> 00:50:44,475  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:458 Y2:495

The cops swear

638
00:50:58,278 --> 00:51:00,394  X1:074 X2:643 Y1:458 Y2:500
You didn't learn nothing in juvie, did you?

639
00:51:00,478 --> 00:51:03,151  X1:123 X2:595 Y1:458 Y2:534
Supposed to teach you not to piss

642
00:51:06,598 --> 00:51:09,066  X1:107 X2:609 Y1:458 Y2:500
You ain't got a clue what's going on<i>.</i>

643
00:51:09,678 --> 00:51:12,033  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:458 Y2:500

645
00:51:13,878 --> 00:51:16,472  X1:138 X2:578 Y1:458 Y2:534
You wanna do 10 years in here?
That's your business<i>.</i>

646
00:51:16,558 --> 00:51:20,107  X1:063 X2:655 Y1:458 Y2:534

650
00:51:36,158 --> 00:51:40,754  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:458 Y2:534
You cannot put Tiger Woods

651
00:51:40,958 --> 00:51:43,108  X1:071 X2:646 Y1:458 Y2:500
You don't have to be in shape to play golf<i>.</i>

652
00:51:43,198 --> 00:51:45,428  X1:084 X2:632 Y1:458 Y2:500

653
00:51:45,678 --> 00:51:48,317  X1:179 X2:541 Y1:458 Y2:534

654
00:51:48,398 --> 00:51:51,037  X1:084 X2:633 Y1:458 Y2:500
Well, unless he bench presses my dick<i>...</i>

657
00:51:57,038 --> 00:51:59,996  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:458 Y2:534
You worship the guy<i>.</i>
You'd crucify the mother, ay?

658
00:52:00,198 --> 00:52:01,313  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:458 Y2:500
Whatever, Dinger<i>.</i>

660
00:52:03,918 --> 00:52:04,907  X1:278 X2:439 Y1:458 Y2:529
-Baseball?
-Who?

661
00:52:05,118 --> 00:52:07,757  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:458 Y2:500
Fall asleep during the action<i>.</i>

662
00:52:07,918 --> 00:52:10,034  X1:070 X2:649 Y1:458 Y2:495
Don't knock baseball<i>.</i> That's un-American<i>.</i>

663
00:52:10,118 --> 00:52:11,676  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:458 Y2:500
Wake me up when it's over<i>.</i>

664
00:52:11,758 --> 00:52:13,510  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:458 Y2:500
Come on, guys<i>.</i> Come on<i>.</i>

665
00:52:13,758 --> 00:52:16,830  X1:106 X2:613 Y1:458 Y2:529
The greatest athlete without a doubt
was Muhammad Ali<i>.</i>

666
00:52:16,918 --> 00:52:18,715  X1:121 X2:598 Y1:458 Y2:500
He could defeat you with his mind<i>.</i>

667
00:52:18,878 --> 00:52:22,393  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:458 Y2:534
He would never have to put a finger
on you, and have you psyched out<i>.</i>

668
00:52:23,278 --> 00:52:25,030  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:458 Y2:529

Hey<i>.</i>

670
00:52:31,598 --> 00:52:32,713  X1:231 X2:488 Y1:458 Y2:500
How's your head?

671
00:52:33,918 --> 00:52:36,716  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:458 Y2:534
Head is fine<i>.</i>
lt's my pride that's still hurting<i>.</i>

672
00:52:36,798 --> 00:52:37,992  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:458 Y2:500
Question for you<i>.</i>

673
00:52:38,078 --> 00:52:41,593  X1:081 X2:635 Y1:458 Y2:529
Six months ago, there was a bust<i>.</i>
A kid named Shaun Rollins<i>.</i> Remember?

674
00:52:41,678 --> 00:52:44,636  X1:088 X2:629 Y1:458 Y2:534
-Yeah, vaguely<i>.</i> Why?
-Anything suspicious about that arrest?

675
00:52:44,718 --> 00:52:46,913  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:458 Y2:498
Far as l can remember, it was clean<i>.</i>

676
00:52:47,118 --> 00:52:50,713  X1:090 X2:628 Y1:458 Y2:534
Montini always pays attention to detail
when he types those things up<i>.</i>

677
00:52:50,798 --> 00:52:53,266  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:458 Y2:534
-Montini was the arresting officer?
-Yeah<i>.</i> Why?

678
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:56,236  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:458 Y2:534
Where could l find him?
To put two and two together<i>...</i>

679
00:52:56,318 --> 00:52:57,273  X1:234 X2:484 Y1:458 Y2:500
<i>...</i>even things up<i>.</i>

680
00:53:18,358 --> 00:53:19,586  X1:305 X2:413 Y1:458 Y2:495
Relax<i>.</i>

681
00:53:19,678 --> 00:53:22,033  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:458 Y2:534
-What the fuck you doing?
-Shut up<i>.</i> Hands down<i>.</i>

682
00:53:22,558 --> 00:53:24,708  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:458 Y2:534
-What are you doing?
-Why you pressing me?

683
00:53:24,878 --> 00:53:27,267  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:458 Y2:534
-Who's pressing you?
-You got a cop on my ass<i>.</i>

684
00:53:27,438 --> 00:53:29,030  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:458 Y2:500
Same guy from the other night<i>.</i>

685
00:53:29,118 --> 00:53:32,155  X1:077 X2:643 Y1:458 Y2:534
He's a Neanderthal<i>.</i> He keeps popping up
all over the place<i>.</i>

686
00:53:33,598 --> 00:53:35,350  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:458 Y2:495
He's not one of ours<i>.</i>

687
00:53:35,558 --> 00:53:38,789  X1:105 X2:612 Y1:458 Y2:534
l'll take care of him<i>.</i> But what
were you thinking, showing up here?

688
00:53:38,878 --> 00:53:40,789  X1:139 X2:580 Y1:458 Y2:500
l should just shoot you in case--

689
00:53:41,438 --> 00:53:43,349  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:458 Y2:500
Look, if l wanted to bust you, man<i>...</i>

690
00:53:43,438 --> 00:53:46,714  X1:076 X2:642 Y1:458 Y2:529
<i>...</i>l'd have brought you in a long time ago<i>.</i>
This is business<i>.</i>

691
00:53:46,798 --> 00:53:49,756  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:458 Y2:529
l just got a shitload of product
for our next deal<i>.</i>

692
00:53:57,198 --> 00:53:58,916  X1:264 X2:453 Y1:458 Y2:529
-Forget it<i>.</i>
-How much?

693
00:53:59,678 --> 00:54:00,906  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:458 Y2:497
Around $5 million<i>.</i>

694
00:54:00,998 --> 00:54:02,067  X1:268 X2:448 Y1:458 Y2:500
Yeah, right<i>.</i>

695
00:54:02,278 --> 00:54:05,076  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:458 Y2:534
You wanted seven figures,
that's what l brought, right?

696
00:54:05,918 --> 00:54:08,148  X1:099 X2:619 Y1:458 Y2:500
lf not, then we do have a big problem<i>.</i>

697
00:54:08,398 --> 00:54:12,596  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:458 Y2:534
$5 million? lt'll get me locked up
until l'm eligible for social security<i>.</i>

698
00:54:12,798 --> 00:54:16,074  X1:110 X2:608 Y1:458 Y2:534
l don't need social security, asshole<i>.</i>
l need police security<i>.</i>

699
00:54:16,638 --> 00:54:18,708  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:458 Y2:500
So before we do any more business<i>...</i>

700
00:54:19,518 --> 00:54:21,873  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:458 Y2:534

701
00:54:22,918 --> 00:54:23,873  X1:287 X2:430 Y1:458 Y2:500
All right<i>.</i>

702
00:54:24,558 --> 00:54:27,516  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:458 Y2:534
Would it ease your worries
if l showed you our operation?

703
00:54:29,758 --> 00:54:31,191  X1:256 X2:462 Y1:458 Y2:500
Fucking right<i>.</i>

We'll call you when we're ready<i>.</i>
You just have the money together<i>.</i>

706
00:54:40,558 --> 00:54:41,354  X1:308 X2:410 Y1:458 Y2:495
Done<i>.</i>

708
00:55:01,518 --> 00:55:02,712  X1:266 X2:451 Y1:458 Y2:500
Boyd? Shit!

709
00:55:03,878 --> 00:55:05,596  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:458 Y2:500
l just came in to use the phone<i>.</i>

710
00:55:05,678 --> 00:55:07,634  X1:141 X2:577 Y1:458 Y2:500
Relax, man<i>.</i> l just need a favor<i>.</i>

711
00:55:07,718 --> 00:55:10,516  X1:155 X2:565 Y1:458 Y2:534
Ladies, would you let me talk
to my friend for a minute?

712
00:55:12,038 --> 00:55:16,077  X1:068 X2:649 Y1:458 Y2:529
Anything<i>.</i> You need me to go undercover?
l'm like a chameleon<i>.</i>

713
00:55:16,158 --> 00:55:19,753  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:458 Y2:534
lt also looks like you're kicking
a lot of big ass there<i>.</i> How many guys?

714
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:22,477  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:458 Y2:534
Two, but they were huge<i>.</i>
They were meat packers<i>.</i>

715
00:55:22,958 --> 00:55:26,155  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:458 Y2:534
l could've used some of your moves<i>.</i>
Maybe you could teach me<i>.</i>

716
00:55:26,238 --> 00:55:29,867  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:458 Y2:534
Later<i>.</i> You know that expose you did
on the Mob a few years ago?

717
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:32,796  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:458 Y2:500
How'd you get that intel?

718
00:55:32,998 --> 00:55:36,877  X1:082 X2:634 Y1:458 Y2:534
l can be resourceful<i>.</i> Plus, l work
with the l Team, a group of former Pl's<i>...</i>

719
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:40,394  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:458 Y2:534
<i>...</i>who owe us their licenses
due to various felony convictions<i>.</i>

720
00:55:40,478 --> 00:55:43,993  X1:088 X2:631 Y1:458 Y2:534
l need you to find out whatever you can
about a guy called Latrell Walker<i>.</i>

721
00:55:44,078 --> 00:55:45,989  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:458 Y2:500
His identity seems to be a total scam<i>.</i>

722
00:55:46,278 --> 00:55:49,907  X1:070 X2:647 Y1:458 Y2:534
And also what his connection is
with a guy called Shaun Rollins<i>.</i> Can you?

723
00:55:49,998 --> 00:55:53,035  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:458 Y2:534
l'll see what l can dig up<i>.</i>
Why'd you come to me?

724
00:55:53,278 --> 00:55:55,234  X1:107 X2:611 Y1:458 Y2:500
l don't want to attract any attention<i>.</i>

725
00:55:55,318 --> 00:55:57,878  X1:124 X2:594 Y1:458 Y2:534
And l think your peculiar methods
might work for me<i>.</i>

726
00:55:57,958 --> 00:56:00,108  X1:199 X2:518 Y1:458 Y2:534
-What's this all about?
-lt might be nothing<i>.</i>

727
00:56:00,198 --> 00:56:02,837  X1:192 X2:526 Y1:458 Y2:534
lt might be something<i>.</i>
lf it's big, it's really big<i>.</i>

728
00:56:02,918 --> 00:56:05,512  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:458 Y2:534
l just got to see
how high up this shit goes<i>.</i>

729
00:56:05,798 --> 00:56:07,117  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:458 Y2:500
Don't screw this one up<i>.</i>

730
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:09,917  X1:076 X2:641 Y1:458 Y2:534
l won't,
because l've seen you when you're angry<i>.</i>

731
00:56:10,118 --> 00:56:11,517  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:458 Y2:500
All right, ladies?

732
00:56:11,718 --> 00:56:12,707  X1:251 X2:467 Y1:458 Y2:500
Come to papa<i>.</i>

733
00:56:12,958 --> 00:56:14,630  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:458 Y2:529
-You want in on this?
-No<i>.</i>

734
00:56:16,678 --> 00:56:18,350  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:458 Y2:500
l just want to make a toast<i>.</i>

735
00:56:18,438 --> 00:56:21,794  X1:123 X2:594 Y1:458 Y2:534
This is to us

736
00:56:23,118 --> 00:56:24,756  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:458 Y2:500
But l just have one request<i>.</i>

No police talk<i>.</i>

739
00:56:28,558 --> 00:56:31,436  X1:121 X2:599 Y1:458 Y2:534
No mentioning the latest homicide
or gang shooting<i>.</i>

740
00:56:32,238 --> 00:56:34,513  X1:092 X2:625 Y1:458 Y2:500
Tonight, just happy thoughts<i>.</i> Agreed?

What're you doing here, Boyd?

744
00:56:44,718 --> 00:56:47,357  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:458 Y2:534
-You wanted to see me<i>.</i>

745
00:56:47,438 --> 00:56:49,269  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:458 Y2:495
But l'm here now<i>.</i> So let's talk<i>.</i>

746
00:56:49,358 --> 00:56:52,077  X1:081 X2:637 Y1:458 Y2:534
l'm sorry,
but we were actually right in the middle<i>.</i>

747
00:56:52,758 --> 00:56:54,157  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:458 Y2:500
Why don't you take a walk?

748
00:56:55,358 --> 00:56:58,156  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:458 Y2:500
lt's okay<i>.</i> Just give us five minutes<i>.</i>

749
00:57:00,998 --> 00:57:02,909  X1:095 X2:623 Y1:458 Y2:500

-What are you doing with this guy?

751
00:57:09,998 --> 00:57:12,273  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:458 Y2:500
That is none of your business<i>.</i>

752
00:57:12,478 --> 00:57:15,709  X1:151 X2:566 Y1:458 Y2:534

753
00:57:16,838 --> 00:57:18,908  X1:087 X2:631 Y1:458 Y2:500
What did you want to talk to me about?

754
00:57:18,998 --> 00:57:20,670  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:458 Y2:500
Why'd you visit Shaun Rollins?

755
00:57:20,758 --> 00:57:23,989  X1:179 X2:538 Y1:458 Y2:534
-The walls have ears<i>.</i>

756
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:25,950  X1:221 X2:497 Y1:458 Y2:500
So, why am l here?

757
00:57:26,158 --> 00:57:28,547  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:458 Y2:534

What are you up to?

758
00:57:29,518 --> 00:57:32,237  X1:100 X2:618 Y1:458 Y2:529
-You used to work for lnternal Affairs<i>.</i>

759
00:57:32,358 --> 00:57:36,271  X1:099 X2:619 Y1:458 Y2:534
Out of all the people around you,
how'd you know who you could trust?

760
00:57:36,878 --> 00:57:38,357  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:458 Y2:500
Why? What have you got?

761

762
00:57:42,558 --> 00:57:45,834  X1:127 X2:593 Y1:458 Y2:534
Let's just say my instincts tell me
