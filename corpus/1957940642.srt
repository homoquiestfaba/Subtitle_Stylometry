This Thursday, the tip

00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,572
of the U.S. trading day.

35
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,741
Tuesday, March 22 and
here are the top stories

36
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:24,443
that we're following
for you this hour.

37
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,145
All eyes are on Live Talk.

38
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,412
The sound of the studio-

39
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:28,680
- I gotta go to New
York today for a meeting

40
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,649
and then I should
be back by dinner.

41
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,317
- You need me to drop
you off at the airport?

42
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,452
You know I still
gotta go that way

43
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:34,920
to drop Sam off to school.

44
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,488
- Mm, no that's okay.

45
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,990
I have William taking me.

46
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,791
Besides, I need to discuss
a few things with him.

47
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,426
- Is everything okay?

48
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,328
- Yeah, everything's fine.

49
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,763
But we're going public next week

50
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,865
and I need everybody
to be on the same page.

51
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:48,400
- You're going where in public?

52
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,536
- We're making it so
that people can buy stock

53
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:51,837
into our company, son.

54
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,672
- Stock?

55
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,173
- [Adam] Yeah. Stock.

56
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,942
- Now you gotta explain the
stock market to an 11 year old.

57
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:57,777
Good luck.

58
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,111
- Mom, I'm not dumb.

59
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,646
- Nobody's calling
you dumb, baby.

60
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,848
I'm just saying even I don't
understand the ins and outs

61
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,349
of the stock market.

62
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,518
- Wait, so you're telling me
if you go to the supermarket,

63
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,588
you can go there
to buy our company?

64
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,423
- See what you done started?

65
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,525
Look you two better get
going before you be late.

66
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,726
- Mom, you know,
I can't be late.

67
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:15,994
I have to beat Sean there

68
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,563
because he's gonna
try to sit by Kim

69
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,231
and he knows that's
my girlfriend.

70
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,466
- Young man, you do
not have a girlfriend.

71
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,068
- Hold on. Is she cute?

72
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,103
- I don't give a
damn if she's cute.

73
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:26,838
He's too young for a girlfriend.

74
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,540
- Really? She has
to be my girlfriend.

75
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:29,875
She brings me candy every day

76
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,611
and she only brings
candy to her boyfriend.

77
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,546
- And she brings candy?

78
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,081
Yeah you better hurry
up and get him to school

79
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:37,683
before Sean gets there.

80
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,619
My son will always
have the cute girl.

81
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,890
Besides, I got the cute girl.

82
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,626
- What am I gonna
do with you two?

83
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:49,762
- Just love us.

84
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,565
- [Sam] Come on, Mom. Let's go.

85
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,033
- Okay, kiddo. Look.

86
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,069
Let me know when you
make it to the airport.

87
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,570
I'll text you when
I leave the gym.

88
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,605
- Okay.

89
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,740
- Love you. - Love you.

90
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,744
(people chattering)

91
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,052
- What is that smell?

92
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:14,988
- Cologne.

93
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:16,722
- Where did you get that from?

94
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,490
- From your room.

95
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:19,925
- [Jaclyn] How much did you use?

96
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,126
- Not a lot.

97
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:24,630
- Sammy. Baby, you
used the whole bottle.

98
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,198
- Well, I smell good, don't I?

99
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,834
- You do, but you used too much.

100
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,969
- Good because I
really do like her.

101
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,705
- Well, if you like her, she
must be a really good girl.

102
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:34,840
- She's a woman.

103
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,109
- Oh okay. A woman?

104
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,477
Wait.

105
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,178
Is that her?

106
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:41,114
- [Sam] Yes.

107
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:42,914
- [Jaclyn] Oh, she's pretty.

108
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,383
- I know because
she's my girlfriend.

109
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,486
- (chuckles) Okay.
I love you, Sam.

110
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,487
- I love you too.

111
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,961
(people chattering)

112
00:04:58,731 --> 00:04:59,565
- Hey Sam.

113
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:00,565
- [Sam] Hey.

114
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,569
- What am I gon'
do with that kid?

115
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,240
(phone chiming)

116
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,342
Great. New trainer.

117
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:13,812
This is not how I imagine my
day going, but you know what?

118
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,714
I'm not 'bout to
use this as a excuse

119
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:19,318
for me not to go
to the gym. (sighs)

120
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,453
(car engine revving)

121
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,555

122
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:26,024

124
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:35,168
(car engine running)

125
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:45,677
- You got two meetings soon
as you touch down in New York.

126
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,945
- Who's the first meeting with?

127
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:50,482
- (laughs) You ready
for this? Fox Business.

128
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:51,917
- Hm.

129
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,151
That's funny.

130
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:54,519
They're the ones
who said Live Talk

131
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,787
wouldn't be around that long

132
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,022
and that Facebook
was gon' kill us.

133
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,124
- Yeah well they're
kissing your ass now,

134
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,393
singing all your praises.

135
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:05,263
Adam, what are you doing? We
gotta prep you for this man.

136
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:07,866
- I'm fine. I can talk
about this in my sleep.

137
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,868
- What's more
important than this?

138
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:13,139
- It's a lot of things more
important, mainly my wife.

139
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,174
I had to send her some flowers.

140
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:19,311
- Yikes. I get it. I apologize.

141
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,313
(throat clears)

142
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,315
Take a look at this.

143
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:27,919
- Mm.

144
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:33,225
Let's say we should make a
little bit over $17,000,000,000

145
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,726
in the first quarter.

146
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,795
Now them Facebook numbers.

147
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:39,898
- You sir are gonna be
businessman of the year.

148
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,301
- I appreciate that,
man, but it was the team.

149
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:44,736
- You put the team
together, Adam.

150
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,904
It's got everything
to do with you.

151
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,141
- Well, I appreciate that.

152
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:50,642
Look, I'll be back
later on tonight

153
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,177
so I'll see you tomorrow?

154
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,178
- See you then.

155
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,619
- You have a safe trip, sir.

156
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,555
- (grunts) Appreciate
that Carlton.

157
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:04,856
- Let's go.

158
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:07,959
(door slams)

159
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,965
(metal clanking) (fist pounding)

160
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,940
- Excuse me. My
trainer canceled on me.

161
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,075
She said I was supposed to
be meeting her brother here?

162
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,911
- Oh, you mean Lisa?

163
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,312
- Yeah.

164
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,047
- Okay. That's her
brother over there, Malik.

165
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,717
Malik! Can you come over
here? She's looking for you.

166
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:37,522
- Hey, how you doing?
You must be Jaclyn.

167
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:38,623
- Yeah.

168
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,858
- Nice to meet you.

169
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,793
Um, my sister told me
to put you on the bags.

170
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,662
- The bags?

171
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:43,728
- [Malik] Yeah.

172
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,597
- Oo, you'll love the bags.

173
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,099
He's actually the
best at the bags.

174
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,669
- I don't know about the
best, but I appreciate it.

175
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,937
You ready?

176
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,738
- If I'm not ready,
I better get ready.

177
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,807
- Oh, do you have any more
tickets for your show?

178
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,042
- Yeah, I got a few.

179
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,477
- Oo, okay. Can I
have like two more?

180
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,744
I have some friends

What type of artist?

211

00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:08,914
- Understandable.
Maybe next time.

216
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,683

I don't want your support.

220
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,660
Hold on to these.

221

that. I wanna pay.

228
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,376
- Is everything okay with her?

229
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,844
- Yeah, she's good.

230
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:42,514
She just need to take
care of business she said.

231
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,183
- So you're gonna be my
new personal trainer?

232
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,851
- It's cool with me
if it's cool with you.

233
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,386
- I mean, it's cool with me.

234
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,221
And I gotta stay

00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,638
- I know.

241
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,974
That's a secure bright future
for my wife and my son.

242
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,775
- How are they doing anyway?

243
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,510
You know my wife was just asking

244
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,245
about Jaclyn this morning.

245
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,481
She wanted me to you
give both you're welcome.

246
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,016
- Sure will.

00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,085
(Rich whispers)

248
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,453
Are you sure?

249
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,454
- What's wrong?

250
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,324
- Feds is looking into
one of my top people.

251
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:27,392
- Which one?

252
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,793
- [Adam] William.

253
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:32,464
- They're investigating William
McConnell Lee? For what?

254
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,965
- For trying to give
my top competitors

255
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,266
inside trade information

256
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,068
so they could take my
company away from me.

257
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,737
- That son of a bitch.

258
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:39,804
I gotta get on this

259
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,574
right now.
- No, I'ma handle this.

260
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,242
Come on Rich. Let's go.

261
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:48,747
- Wait Adam. It's my job.
I'm supposed to protect you.

262
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:52,517
- Like I said, I'ma
handle this, all of this.

263
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:57,089
- Adam, please. If you need
anything, call me, okay?

264
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:02,128
- I appreciate that, but
I got this. Thanks though.

265
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,635
Man, I just knew something
wasn't right with him.

266
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:13,571
Look I need you to stop all
his access to my company.

267
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:14,572
- Already done.

268
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,176
- 'Lieve I trusted him.

269
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,745
(huffs)

270
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,814
Ain't even see this shit comin'.

271
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,216
Man, this has been
one hell of a day.

272
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:28,587
- Yeah well let's get
back to the airport.

273
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,292
- Don't forget to carry the one.

274
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,593
- Okay, look at this.

275
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:38,329
- I think you got
it. Good job, Sammy.

276
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,597
- Good job, Sam.

277
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:41,166
Looks like somebody's
gonna be an accountant

278
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,333
when they get older.

279
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:43,302
- I don't wanna be a accountant.

280
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,470
I wanna run Daddy's company.

281
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:48,240
- Well, you know what? I think
that'll be very possible.

282
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,444
- Today at Playground
Gallery in Detroit,

283
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,380
artist Malik Brown will
have his work on display.

284
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,016
Brown is viewed as one of the
hottest up and coming artists

285
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,417
of his generation.

286
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:00,418
Let's take a look.

287
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,958
- You think you can
watch him for me tonight?

288
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,359
- Yeah. That's not
gon' be a problem.

289
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,861

(phone ringing)

299
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,185
- Hello?

300
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:35,954
- Hey, you sound like
you in a good mood.

301
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:37,388
- I wouldn't say that.

302
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,858
I'm just getting dressed,
about to head to this art show.

303
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,379
- Well, that sounds
cool. Whose is it?

304
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:45,330
- Uh, Malik Brown. Lisa
gave me a ticket to go.

305
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:49,501
- Hm. Well, I just landed.
I can meet you up there.

306
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,070
- Well, she really only
gave me one ticket.

307
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,338
I can wait for you though

308
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,074
when you get here and
then we can go together.

309
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:59,377
- Mm, nah that's okay.
You go 'head. Have fun.

310
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,880
I'ma just grab something
to eat on the way home.

311
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,315
- I ordered Sam a pizza
with all the meats on it.

312
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,317
- Oh, okay. I could have that.

313
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,620
Well I'll see you
when you get home.

314
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,289
- Yes you will. I love you.

315
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,892
- I love you with
all of my heart.

316
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:16,161
- I know. You always show me.

317
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,463
- And I'm supposed to.

318
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,999
Besides I had a bad day

319
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,434
and you're the only one
that make my days better.

320
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,236
- And that's what
I'm supposed to do.

321
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:28,373
- You do. I'll see you tonight.

322
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:29,375
- All right.

323
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:35,413
(heels clacking)

324
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:36,315
- [Sam] Mom?

325
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,549
- Yeah, baby?

326
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,117
- Why did you name me
Samuel and not Cameron?

327
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,285
I like Cameron.

328
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,719
- Because you're
named after my father.

329
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,288
- I wish my name was Cameron.

330
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,756
- [Jaclyn] Well,
when you get older

331
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,524
and you decide you want
people to call you Cameron,

332
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,359
you can do that.

333
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,626
- I'm gonna start now.

334
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:49,695
- That's fine, Sam.

335
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,263
- My name is Cameron.

336
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:53,232
- Okay, Sam.

337
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,166
- Cameron.

338
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,600
- Alright. Okay, Cameron.

339
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,335
I'ma see you later. Okay?
- Okay.

340
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,837
- Make sure you save
your dad some pizza.

341
00:13:58,838 --> 00:13:59,838
- Okay. I will.

342
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:01,273
- Oh.

343
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:02,874
(Sam mumbling quietly)

344
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,642
- Adam is on his way back.

345
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:06,211
Can you make sure he
save him some pizza?

346
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,046
- Okay. I will.

347
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:08,047
- Okay.

348
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:08,881
- Have fun.

349
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:09,748

00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:39,311
(people chattering)

356
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,553
- Hello.

357
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,089

358
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,258
(Jaclyn speaking quietly)

359
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,059
It's beautiful.

360
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,996
- Hopefully this is
gonna continue to grow.

361
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,298
But let's go ahead
and get started.

362
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,299
- Sure.

363
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,104
- Excuse me, everyone.

364
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,973
Uh, if I can get your attention.

365
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:12,277
Um, first off, I'd
like to thank everyone

366
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,879
for coming tonight.

367
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,348
Uh, today's a very
big day for me, um,

368
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,217
because, uh, honestly I never

369
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:22,086
thought I would be
selling something that

370
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,490
people actually wanted to buy.

371
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,058
Um,

372
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:31,764
this the first piece I painted
after losing my brother.

373
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:36,567
Uh, so for me, this is
a very special piece,

374
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:40,204
um, but I'm actually
ready to see it in a home

375
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:43,374
that's gonna love
it, uh, because, uh,

376
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,077
every time I look at it,
I just get emotional.

377
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:48,046
(deeply breathes)

378
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:52,184
So with that being said, Mike,
can we start the bidding?

379
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,053
- All right. Thank
you all for coming.

00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,754

- (crying) Nothing.

467
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:40,572
- Then why are you crying?
Is everything okay?

468
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,576
- As long as I got you,

469
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:48,413
everything will always be okay.

(intense orchestral music)

474
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,333
- So you really telling
me I can't fire him?

475
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:44,969
- No, it's better if you
let the feds handle him.

476
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,671
- [Adam] So how long do I
gotta act like I like him?

477
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,307
- Just long enough for the
government to do their job.

478
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,010
In the meantime, I'll have
a man on him 24 hours a day.

479
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,846
- Can't believe he'd put my
company in jeopardy like this.

480
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,815
He was really gon' try and
take my company from me.

481
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,684
And I was a damn
good boss to him.

482
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:03,421
- Everything's gonna work
out, all right? I promise.

483
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:04,522
- [Jaclyn] Excuse me.

484
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:05,357
- Hey.

485
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,357
- Hey.

486
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,461
Wait, damn. Isn't
it your birthday?

487
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:11,696
- Yes, it is.

488
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:12,997
- Honey, did you get
what we discussed?

489
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,632
- You talking about
the birthday gift?

490
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,167
- Yes, the gift.

491
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,401
- Course I did.

492
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:18,669
Sam? - Yes, Mom?

493
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,439
- Give Miss Debra
her birthday gift.

494
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,447
(mental clanking)

495
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,682
- No way. (gasps)

496
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:32,683
Nah huh.

497
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,387
Y'all bought me a house?

498
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,657
Uh, why would y'all
do this? Oh my God.

499
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,258
- Because we love you.

500
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:45,062
- Baby, I love you too, but
y'all I can't take this.

501
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:47,632
- Yes, you can. You
can and you will.

502
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,135
Look. You've been with
us for a long time now.

503
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,970
Your daughter's been
like a big sister to Sam.

504
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:55,706
Y'all practically
helped us raise him.

505
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,309
Look, we would've went crazy
without the two of you.

506
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,245
So you gon' take that
house and you gon' love it

507
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:02,180
because it's yours.

508
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:04,081
- Uh, y'all are the best.

509
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:07,351
Uh, I don't know how
I'll ever repay y'all.

510
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:09,620
- By enjoying your new house.

511
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:12,323
- Oh, I sure am. I love this.

512
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:13,691
Well, I forgot about...

513
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,560
Um, there's a Mrs.
Washington here to see you.

514
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,629
- Send her in.

515
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,431
- Okay. Come on, baby.

516
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:24,068
Why you didn't tell me y'all
bought me a house, huh?

517
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,504
- Where you going looking
like a supermarket?

518
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:27,972
- Well I'm going shopping

519
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,040

00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:32,576

522
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,111

525
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,917
- Well, it smells amazing.

526

528
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:44,488
- I'm sorry.

529
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:46,590
My husband never misses a chance

530
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,793
to show me how important
I am to him. (laughs)

531
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,060
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

532
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:52,229
I just never want her
to leave me sometimes.

533
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,731
I'm sorry. Are you married?

534
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,500
- I was, but, um,

535
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:58,769
my husband died from
cancer six months ago.

536
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,871
- I'm sorry to hear that.

537
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:03,340
- I am too, but

538
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:04,575
this is good.

539
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,777
Always show her
that you love her

540
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,880
and tell her as
often as you can.

541
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:14,051
If I have any regret is that
I didn't tell my husband

542
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:16,887
more often that I love him.

543
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:19,290
- Well, he does a
great job at that.

544
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,724
But I'm not gon' hold y'all up.

545
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:22,693
I gotta get going 'cause I
don't wanna have Kelly waiting.

546
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:25,363
- All right. I'll see you later.

547
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,199
Well,

548
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,968
I am Adam Hewer and this
is my associate Rich Steed.

549
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,003
You can have a seat.

550
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:34,672
- I am Maria Washington.

551
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:35,973
- It's nice to meet you.

552
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,274
- [Rich] Boss, I'm gonna
go take care of that.

553
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:38,877
- Okay. Have a seat.

554
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:44,915
- Well, I am glad to
finally meet you in person.

555
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,150
You are the talk

556
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,651
of the tech community.
- Thank you.

557
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:51,255
- And you did it all without
any Silicon Valley money.

558
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,790
- Hm.

559
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:55,659
Yeah, well, I took my buyout
that I made from my last job

560
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,294
and I developed Live Talk.

561
00:24:57,295 --> 00:25:01,165
I knew that if I bet on me,
the world would love it.

562
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,969
- But why didn't you take
the Google and Facebook money

563
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,372
when they came with an
open unlimited checkbook?

564
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:09,840
- Simple.

565
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,043
If they wanted it that bad,
why shouldn't I keep it?

566
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,012
- Can you explain that?

567
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,114
- Look, I came from nothing.

568
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:18,983
My mother had me and my brother

569
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,619
and we basically had
to share clothes.

570
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,188
We knew nothing about
generational wealth.

571
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,589
We knew check to check.

572
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,857
So when they came to me

573
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,360
with what most people
might consider enough,

574
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,561
I knew that it wasn't.

575
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:33,364
And it was at that
moment that I realized

576
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,865
that somebody had
to come to them

577
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:38,335
with that same offer they
making me and they said no.

578
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:41,138
And now they're the ones
that's making the offers.

579
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:42,506
Wouldn't you wanna be the
ones making the offers,

580
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:43,507
Miss Washington?

581
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,978
- That is powerful.

582
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:49,680
So,

583
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:52,884
tell me how the name
Live Talk came about.

584
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,719
- Well,

585
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,088
I got my ideas from...

586
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:00,625
(cheery music)

587
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,200
- [Jaclyn] Malik!

588
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,135
- Who is it?

589
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:12,270
- It's me, Jas. I mean, Jac.

590
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:16,774
- I didn't think you
was gon' really come.

591
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:19,277
- I didn't think I would
be here until I got here.

592
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,612
- It's crazy, man.

593
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:23,314
I really couldn't, um, sleep

594
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:25,349
without thinking
about you last night.

595
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:29,186
- I know the feeling. I couldn't
sleep last night either.

596
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:30,288
Thought about you too.

597
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:34,358
- So how long have
you been married?

598
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,660
- I don't wanna talk
about my husband.

599
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:38,562
So can we talk about
something else?

600
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:40,564
- And I think it's
important we talk about him.

601
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:43,834
- And I don't. So let's
just change the subject.

602
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:44,835
- [Malik] Why?

603
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:51,241
- Because I love my
husband and he's a good man

604
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:52,477
and I love my son,

605
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:56,447
but it's just something missing.

606
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,916
And it's something about you.

607
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:01,885
- What about me?

608
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:03,955
- I'm just comfortable
when I'm with you.

609
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,824
Like when we was at the gym

610
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,525
and you had your
hands all on me.

611
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:11,161
I didn't want you
to stop touching me.

612
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:13,564
I really wanted you
to kiss me right there

613
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:14,499
in the middle of that gym.

614
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,900
- Well, why didn't you kiss me?

615
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,903
- Because I'm married and
I'm wrong for being here.

616
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:21,873
I gotta go.
- Wait. Where you going?

617
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:24,575
- Home.

618
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:26,177
- You right where you should be.

619
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:28,779
Well,

620
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:31,715
all you have to do

621
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:32,851
is what I say do.

622
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,821
Nothing more, nothing less.

623
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:40,025
I want you to be mines.

00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:56,133
- Hey, I've been calling you.

646
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:56,968
- I know.

647
00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:58,535
Me and Kelly went...

648
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:01,438
We got massages and facials.

649
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,840
- Well, I was a little worried.

650
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,908
It's not like you to
not answer your phone.

651
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,311
- Adam, I said I went
and got a massage.

652
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:09,379
- Is everything okay?

653
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,482
- Yeah. I'm all right.

654
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,617
I'll see you when
I get home, okay?

655
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:14,618
- Yeah. Okay.

656
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:16,488
Jax?

657
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:17,322
- [Jaclyn] Yeah?

658
00:29:17,323 --> 00:29:18,455
- I love you.

659
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:19,624
- Yeah, me too.

660
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,063
(Jaclyn sighs)

661
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:29,366
- Where you going?

662
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:30,934
- [Jaclyn] I'm going home.

663
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:34,037
- Man, you right where you
supposed to be, man. Lay down.

664
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,807
- No, I should be at
home with my family.

665
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:39,610
You know I've been married
to my husband for 12 years

666
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,711
and I've never cheated on him?

667
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:42,813
- What you telling me that for?

668
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:44,248
- Because I'm not some hoe.

669
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:47,484
- Who you trying to
convince? Me or yourself?

670
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:48,719
- Fuck you!

671
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,820
- Wait. I don't even
mean it like that.

672
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:52,322
- Nah, fuck you!
And I mean that!

673
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:56,227
- Calm down, man. I don't
even mean it like that.

674
00:29:58,163 --> 00:29:59,163
Jaclyn!

675
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:01,098
Jax!

676
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,500
(teeth sucks)

677
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:04,501
Fuck man.

678
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:07,671
Damn.

679
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:10,140
- (scoffs) I can't believe
this is happening Jax.

680
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:10,975
What the fuck?

681
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:11,975
Like

682
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:14,646
what are you doing?

683
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:17,347
Fuck.

684
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:20,485
(tire thuds)

685
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:23,687
God.

686
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:39,370
(car engines running)

687
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,344
Hello?

688
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,880
- Hey, is that you? - What?

689
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:51,181
What you talking about?

690
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,983
- [Trina] On the
street? Is that you?

691
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:56,086
- Oh girl. Yeah. I done
caught a flat on my tire.

692
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:58,422
- [Trina] Okay. We got you.
We 'bout to pull up on you.

693
00:30:58,423 --> 00:30:59,723
- All right.

694
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:02,794
(car engines running)

695
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,534
(car beeping)

696
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,835
- [Mark] Your jack and
spare in the trunk?

697
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:13,070
- Yep. - All right.

698
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,591
Give me about five
minutes. I got you.

699
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:26,216
- Girl, why you looking so
stressed? It's just a flat tire.

700
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,685
- Girl, I wish it
was just a flat tire.

701
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:30,687
- What's going on?

702
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:32,155
- Can I ask you a question?

703
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:33,557
- Yeah. What's up?

704
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,325
- How long y'all
two been married?

705
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:36,660
- God.

706
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:37,928
15 long,

707
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,062
hard,

708
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:42,066
stressful, but beautiful years.

709
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:44,902
- You never thought
you made a mistake?

710
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,204
Like you married
the wrong person?

711
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:48,338
- Yeah. Three days a week.

712
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:49,840
(both laugh)

713
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:52,943
But the other four show me
that I made the right choice.

714
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:54,745
Why? Why? What's up?

715
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,948
- You ever thought
about cheating on him?

716
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:02,720
- (sighs) Thought
about? I did. I know.

717
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:03,988
I just...

718
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:05,489
At that moment,

719
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,024
the other guy made feel like
he was giving me something

720
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:10,193
that I needed, but
girl, he wasn't shit.

721
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:11,628
- What you mean?

722
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,530
- I mean, any man that
messes with a married woman

723
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:14,932
does not want you.

724
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,433
And the moment you
leave your husband,

725
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,035
you realize you didn't
have shit in common

726
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,937
with this guy other than sex.

727
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:23,373
- But what happens when
everything just get boring?

728
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:25,509
Like when you want your
husband to fuck you?

729
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,010
- Then fuck him.

730
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:30,180
Girl, put on a porno and tell
his ass to do what he sees.

731
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:31,481
- Girl, I guess.

732
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:32,950
- Look, Jax.

733
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:36,353
We all have these phases
where we want something new

734
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:38,522
where we feel like we can
do better than what we have.

735
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:42,526
But girl, you don't
wanna make that mistake.

736
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:45,862
When Mark found out I cheated
on him, it killed him.

737
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:49,132
It took me years to prove
to him he was all I needed.

738
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,133
You hear me?

739
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,637
You don't wanna hurt the
man you love like that.

740
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,506
If this is something you're
seriously thinking about,

741
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:57,674
don't,

742
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:58,509
okay?

743
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,543
- All right.

744
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,378
- Jax, I'm serious.

745
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:02,612
- Okay.

746
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:03,614
- All right.

747
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:10,053
- All done. You good.

748
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:12,990
- Thank you. Look, I owe
both of y'all dinner.

749
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,391
- You know he can eat.

750
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,193
- Oh, I know. But
what about you?

751
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:17,694
- Well, I have this
little two piece

752
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:20,397
I'm tryna squeeze into so
I'ma take a rain check.

753
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:21,631
- Girl, I hear you.

754
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:23,500
But look, Trina,
I really, really,

755
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,335
really appreciate you.
- Girl, stop thanking me.

756
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,337
You know you're
family. Cut it out.

757
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,872
You just tell that
little sexy cook of yours

758
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:30,874
I want my favorite, the pasta.

759
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,142
- No he ain't sexy.

760
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:34,511
- Babe, you know,
you're all I want.

761
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,247
I just want his food and I
want your. (teeth clicks)

762
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:38,482
- Baby you a freak.

763
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:39,750
- Your little freak.

764
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,818
- I'll see y'all two later.
- Bye girl.

765
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:43,888
- Thank you.
- You have a good day.

766
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,163
(car beeping)

767
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,268
- These are really pretty.

768
00:33:58,269 --> 00:33:59,669
- [Seller] Thank you.

769
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,471
- I'm just looking for
something small, lil' key chain.

770
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:02,939
How much is this?

771
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,508
- [Seller] You're in
luck. That's only $3.

772
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:05,343
- Can I get it?

773
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:06,343
- Absolutely.

774
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:09,613
- [Coya] Why are you
acting like this?

775
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:12,816
Kiss on me right now
here and look at you.

776
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:15,685
- [Coya's Lover] I feel
like I'm losing my woman.

777
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:16,621
- [Coya] Stop it.

778
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:17,555
- [Coya's Lover] Stop what?

779
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,222
- [Coya] I'm not an ochre.

780
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,757
- [Coya's Lover]
Coya, I love you.

781
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:22,059
- [Coya] Not now.

782
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,927
(phone tone ringing)

783
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:25,263
- Girl, pick up the phone.

784
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:30,467
(phone ringing)

785
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:31,701
- Hello?

786
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:34,838
- Hey baby. What's
up? What you doing?

787
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:37,541
- Nothing. I just had a flat
tire, but it's fixed now.

788
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,476
What's up with you
Ma? How's Daddy?

789
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,745
- Well, not much. And
you know your Dad.

790
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,748
He just being your Dad,
acting like a old man.

791
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,884
- Ma, can I ask you something
and you not judge me?

792
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:49,586
- [Jaclyn's Mom] You okay?

793
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,254
- Yeah. I'm good. I
just need some advice.

794
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,123
- All right. I'm listening.

795
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:54,925
- You ever felt like you
and Daddy's relationship

796
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,460
just reached it's peak?

797
00:34:56,461 --> 00:35:00,363
- All the time, but
then I find another way

798
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:02,466
to take it to another level.

799
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,901
- So you never thought
about leaving him,

800
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:06,937
even after all the
times he cheated?

801
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,672
You didn't feel
short on the bills?

802
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,340
You never just
wanted to just leave?

803
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:11,341
- Now. I didn't say that.

804
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:14,578
I wanted to leave 1,000 times,

805
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:17,614
but I realized it's
nothing out there.

806
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:21,551
And before I start a
relationship with somebody new,

807
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:23,855
I might as well
work on this one.

808
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:26,723
- You know what? You right.

809
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:29,526
I need to work on
fixing my relationship

810
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:31,761
before I do something
I'm gon' regret.

811
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:34,364
- I think that would
be a good idea.

812
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:37,434
And like I said, I just
called to check on you.

813
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:41,471
- Hey Ma, I'm thankful that
I still got you in my life.

814
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,573
I really love you.

815
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:46,443
- I love you more baby.

816
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:50,915
Now, you go and you make
your marriage better, okay?

817
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:53,451
- I promise Ma. I will.

818
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:56,520
- That's all I can ask.

819
00:35:56,521 --> 00:36:00,024
And baby, remember, don't nothing
beat a failure, but a try.

820
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:03,928
- I'll talk to you later. Bye.

821
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:09,933
♪ If you give me
everything I need ♪

822
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:13,370
(balls clanking)

823
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:15,740
- [Rich] What are you
over there thinking about?

824
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:19,643
Adam.

825
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:22,612
Adam.

826
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:23,581
- [Adam] Sorry.

827
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:25,016
- What's on your mind man?

828
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,618
- Nothing really.

829
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:33,323
- Mr. Hewer, you got a package.

830
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:34,324
- Coming down now.

831
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:43,266
Take that.

832
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:47,637
You can have him take
it in there for me.

833
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:49,173
- [Debbie] Okay. Come with me.

834
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:55,378
- Why that look?

835
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,681
- My wife bought a
painting for $100,000.

836
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:00,751
- $100,000? Jesus Christ.

837
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:06,289
- Thanks a lot. You
take care, okay?

838
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,958
- [Adam] 'Preciate that.

839
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,192
- Aw thanks, my baby.

840
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:12,028
- Oo, that's a
nice tip. (laughs)

841
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:13,863
Hey Rich. How you doing?

842
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:15,098
- I'm good.

843
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:16,233
How are you Debbie?
- I'm good. I'm good.

844
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,701
So are you gon' stay for dinner?

845
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:19,135
- No, actually, I have
something to take care of,

846
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:20,937
but I'll take a
rain check for ya.

847
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:22,505
- Debra, are you
staying for dinner?

848
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:24,040
And I'm not taking a
rain check from you.

849
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:25,275
- Mm mm. You gon' have to.

850
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:27,811
Because I wanna go see
my new house in person.

851
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:28,646
I'll see y'all later.

852
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:30,146
(Adam laughs)

853
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:31,748
- Well, I guess it's just
gon' be the three of us.

854
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,618
- Well, Sammy just left
to go stay at Chuck's.

855
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:38,121
- Chuck's? His mom lets them
eat junk food all night.

856
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:39,623
- He'll be fine.

857
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:41,958
- Well, I guess it's
just the two of us then.

858
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:43,060
- I guess so.

859
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:45,962
Mm.

860
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:51,068
So you get a chance to see
Sammy's little girlfriend?

861
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:53,503
Jax.

862
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:56,373
- I'm sorry baby. Were
you saying something?

863
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:59,210
(slow jazz music)

864
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:02,513
- Are you happy?

865
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,450
- What is happy?

866
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,655
I mean like really what is it?

867
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:17,261
We got a lot of money.
We have nice cars.

868
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,397
Our son is healthy
and extremely happy,

869
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:22,566
but what are we doing?

870
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,703
- Well, I live for you and Sam.

871
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:29,572
I mean, what else you
want me to do Jax?

872
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:32,576
Because for you, I
will do anything.

873
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,946
- I got you something.

874
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:38,281
- You did?

875
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:39,749
- Yeah. It's not
nothing really big.

876
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:43,688
It's just something to
tell you that I'm sorry.

877
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:46,256
- And I love it.

878
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:48,425
- And I love you.

879
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:51,762
(slow orchestral music)

880
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:59,170

from a artist I
never even heard of?

who Van Gogh was

before he became Van Gogh.

919
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,213

you bought it. I like this.

I think I wanna meet him.

I really don't know how to
get in contact with him,

936
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:13,830
but I can get his info for you.

937

- So,

946
00:42:40,258 --> 00:42:43,293
(throat clears)

947
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:47,730
right now I have the
power to let you buy 30%

948
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,465
of the shares of Live Talk.

949
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:53,870
After that, you can buy the
ones from 15 other investors

950
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:57,507
who have between 21 and 25%,

951
00:42:57,508 --> 00:43:00,977
putting you at
roughly 51 to 55%,

952
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:03,680
and complete control
of the company.

953
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:07,250
- Are you sure you
can make this happen?

954
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:10,687
It just seem like a lot of
moving parts with this deal.

955
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:13,990
- Moving parts is
what I do best.

956
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:18,861
Yes, I'm sure. I'm willing
to bet my life on it.

957
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:20,430
- How much are you talking?

958
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:23,299
Exactly how much would
you need from me?

959
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,035
- Well, now we're talking.

960
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:31,140
$10,000,000 and I will make
you the most powerful woman

961
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:32,342

00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:34,844

963
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:35,746
- Bitch.

964
00:43:35,747 --> 00:43:37,880
- Excuse me?

965
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:38,948
- Sorry. Sorry.

00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,951
(both laughing)

967
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:45,955
I see a friend of mine's
wife in here. He's not here.

968
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,825
She's doing the things she
should be doing with him

969
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:49,893
with another guy.

970
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:53,497
- I see. I was about to say.

971
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:58,167
Well, it doesn't seem like she's
a good wife to your friend.

972
00:43:58,168 --> 00:44:00,003
- Loyalty is everything.

973
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:03,039
- I agree. Are you loyal?

974
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:08,045
- Yes I am, loyal to the most
important person in the world.

975
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:11,014
- And who would
that be? Your wife?

976
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:13,717
- (laughs) Cassandra,
I like your style.

977
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:16,919
Myself.

978
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:19,922
I'm loyal to me.

979
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:22,859
You see, I understand that
the one thing you can bet on

980
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,561
is that a person will always
do what's best for them.

981
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:27,630
- And is that why
you're doing this deal?

982
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:29,265
You're doing what's
best for you?

983
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:31,734
- I'm doing what any
good business man

984
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:33,137
would do to feed his family.

985
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:38,207
- Okay.

986
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:40,610
I'm in.

987
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:43,946
Where would you like for
me to send the money?

988
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:47,151
- I will send that to you
in an hour. Thank you.

989
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:49,386
- Sounds good.

990
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:53,924
By the way, are you gonna tell
your friend about his wife?

991
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,293
- Like I said,

992
00:44:57,294 --> 00:44:59,463
a person's always gonna
do what's best for them.

993
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:02,466
She's just doing
what's best for her.

994
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,303
- I hear that, but
we'll be talking soon.

995
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:08,806
- Thank you.

996
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,408
You won't regret this.

997
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:14,410
- I hope not.

998
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:19,416
Remember, you bet your life
you could get this done, right?

999
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:21,417
- Right.

1000
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:25,189
(people chattering)

1001
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:34,398
(phone buzzing)

1002
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:39,035
- This is Rich Steed.

1003
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:41,537
- Hey, it's Cassandra.
Here's the deal.

1004
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:43,673
I'm supposed to
send him $10,000,000

1005
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:45,441
when he texts me
where to send it.

1006
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:46,976
- Okay, perfect.

1007
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:49,011
Let me know when he sends
you the wire information.

1008
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:50,446
He's our first
meeting this morning

1009
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:52,682
and I'm on my way to
pick up Adam right now.

1010
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:55,651
- He's really a self
righteous son of a bitch.

1011
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:57,153
- Yes. That he is.

1012
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:59,188
Just keep me posted about the
wire information, all right?

1013
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:02,259
- Okay. Thanks. I'll wait
for your text to send it.

1014
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,929

1015

- How you doing, Rich?

1018
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,243
- Good, sir. How you
doing this morning?

1019
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:21,311
- Cool, I guess.

1020
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:24,982

1021
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:29,653
(peaceful music)

1022
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:34,958
- Can I ask you something?

1023
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:37,394
- Yeah. Go 'head.

1024
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:42,632
- You believe in
love at first sight?

1025
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:47,103
- I don't know about that
one. Why you asked me that?

1026
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:48,104
- 'Cause

1027
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:53,042
felt like second I saw you, I
knew you was the one for me.

1028
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:56,045
- You know I really didn't
sleep that well last night.

1029
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:59,448
- No? How come? What's been
going on with you, man?

1030
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:00,850
You should be happy.

1031
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:02,318
Company's about to go public,

1032
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,687
literally making you one
of the richest people

1033
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:05,855
on the planet.

1034
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:08,191
- Yeah. Well money
isn't everything, Rich.

1035
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:13,197
The more that I live, the more
I realize that Sammy and Jax

1036
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:16,900
are the reason I
smile, not the money.

1037
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:21,237
- How many women are
you sleeping with?

1038
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:22,405
- Why you asked me that?

1039
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:26,375
- 'Cause we're having
unprotected sex

1040
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:30,012
and I don't wanna take
nothing home to my husband.

1041
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:32,648
- You the one cheating
on your husband.

1042
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:33,584
You shouldn't have
been asking me

1043
00:47:33,585 --> 00:47:35,084
about how many people I'm with.

1044
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:37,019
I should be asking you about
how many people you with.

1045
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,088
- I ain't mean it like that.

1046
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:41,224
- What you mean it like then?

1047
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:42,793
- I'm just saying

1048
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:45,895
I really like you.

1049
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:48,097
And I know I can't ask you
not to see other women,

1050
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:50,968
but I'll just wish you wouldn't.

1051
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:55,906
- Look. Let's not talk about
other people when we together.

1052
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:00,776
I'm not gon' ask you
about your husband.

1053
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:02,945
And I would love it if
you just don't ask me

1054
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:03,946
about other women.

1055
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:05,616
Let's just enjoy
each other time.

1056
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:08,251
- Okay.

1057
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:11,587
I'll play by your rules.

1058
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:14,223
I'm scared that I
like you too much.

1059
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:17,728
- (deeply breathes) Look.

1060
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:22,999
I promise not to
break your heart

1061
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,368
if you promise not
to break mines.

1062
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:29,138
- And I promise to protect
yours with everything in me.

1063
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:30,706
- Good.

1064
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:35,245
♪ It's been so long since
I've felt something good ♪

1065
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:38,114
- Listen, uh, back
to business here.

1066
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:40,549
Sandra met with
William this morning.

1067
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:41,817
- Okay and?

1068
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:44,353
- Told her $10,000,000.

1069
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:45,354
- Really?

1070
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:50,727
All of my life's work is only
worth $10,000,000 to him?

1071
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:54,563
Wow.

1072
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:56,799
- Well, he's your first
meeting this morning.

1073
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,436
She's not gonna send him
anything until we tell her to.

1074
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:02,104
- Good.

1075
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:03,906
I'll take it from there.

1076
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:05,141
(phone chimes)

1077
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:07,044
- She just sent the
wire information.

1078
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:11,881
- Okay. Let her know we gon'
be with him in 20 minutes.

1079
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:13,983
And you gonna let her know
when to send the money.

1080
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:16,752
- All right. You got it.

1081
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:19,489
(balls clacking)

1082
00:49:21,992 --> 00:49:24,126
You know, I can't
help but wonder why

1083
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,162
a man that is getting everything

1084
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:28,965
would cross the person
that has done everything

1085
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,666
to make their lives better.

1086
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:34,136
- Because men don't wanna
say another man helped them,

1087
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:37,506
but real men know that you
won't get nowhere in life

1088
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:39,376
without the help
from another person.

1089
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:42,945
I learned so much from
the people before me

1090
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:45,681
and I have no problem with
giving people their credit.

1091
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:48,017
(fist knocking)

1092
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:51,020
- Excuse me, Adam.
William is here.

1093
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:52,888
- Send him in.

1094
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:55,024
Hey, text her and tell
her to send the money.

1095
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:55,993
- You got it.

1096
00:49:55,994 --> 00:49:59,295
(balls clacking)

1097
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:00,297
- Hey, Hey. Hey.

1098
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,033
How you doing?

1099
00:50:03,034 --> 00:50:04,267
- I'm good. And you?

1100
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:06,703
- I'm well. Thank you.

1101
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:09,872
How's Jaclyn and Sam doing?

1102
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:11,073
- They good.

1103
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:14,210
(phone chimes)

1104
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:15,211
- Great.

1105
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,281
Great. Glad you and
the family are well.

1106
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:20,649
- [Adam] Are you?

1107
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,219
- Yes. Yes. I am.

1108
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:27,356
- Rich can you take yourself
and Yolanda to a early lunch?

1109
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,357
- I'd rather not.

1110
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:30,960
- Leave

1111
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:33,095
now.

1112
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:35,766
(intense music)

1113
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:46,609
So do you really care
how my family is doing?

1114
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,444
- Yeah, of course. Why
would you even ask that?

1115
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:49,745
- Because I saw
the way you smiled

1116
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:51,448
when you just got
that text message.

1117
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:53,316
You care to share?

1118
00:50:53,317 --> 00:50:54,617
- Share what?

1119
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:56,486
- What made you smile
so much in your text.

1120
00:50:57,988 --> 00:51:00,056
- No. I'd rather not.

1121
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,223
- Why?

1122
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,726
- Because it's my
phone and it's private.

1123
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,262
- Come on, man. It's
not that damn private.

1124
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:09,166
- Adam, it was a
text from my wife.

1125
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:13,736
- Really? I never thought
your wife was that damn funny.

1126
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,204
- What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

1127
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:16,605
- It means you a
lying ass bitch.

1128
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:18,808
- Who the fuck are
you talking to?

1129
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:20,109
- A lying ass bitch.

1130
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:22,244
I wanna say son of a bitch,

1131
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,847
but your parents ain't got
nothing to do with this.

1132
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:28,184
Do you even know what I did
before I got into computers?

1133
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:29,185
- No.

1134
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:30,653
Why?

1135
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:32,488
- Because I think
if you did know,

1136
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:34,591
you wouldn't be trying
to fucking play me.

1137
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:39,595
See it's niggas like you

1138
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:43,699
that go to those fancy
schools and get y'all degrees

1139
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,168
that will never understand me.

1140
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:48,671
- What the hell are
you talking about?

1141
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:50,673
- You think you better than me

1142
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:51,674
and that's sad

1143
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:54,844
because I had your back.

1144
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:56,846
I'm the one that
gave you a chance

1145
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:58,380
and you crossed me.
- I never crossed-

1146
00:51:58,381 --> 00:52:01,717
- Man watch who you talking
to! I don't work for you!

1147
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:04,120
Now what the hell was so
funny that made you smile

1148
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,621
in your text message?!

1149
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,624
- Jesus Adam. My wife
sent me a naked picture.

1150
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:09,859
- Nigga stop lying!

1151
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,194
Your wife body ain't
even that goddamn bad.

1152
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:13,096
- Watch it.

1153
00:52:13,097 --> 00:52:14,563
- Be honest.

1154
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:16,332
It was that $10,000,000
that Cassandra just sent you

1155
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:17,333
wasn't it?

1156
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:21,904
- I can, I can explain
that, all right?

1157
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:23,839
I'm... You a, you a bitch?

1158
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,242
A lying ass bitch?

1159
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:28,879
Man I hate the fact
that I even trusted you.

1160
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:32,014
So was that
$10,000,000 worth it?

1161
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:34,416
- No, it's not about
the money, Adam.

1162
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:36,552
It's about the power
and I wanted it.

1163
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:38,754
(William screams)

1164
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:40,756
Let me go. I can't breathe.

1165
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:42,358
- Oh, you wanna fucking breathe?

1166
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:44,493
You don't care if
my fucking kids ate.

1167
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,995
(William gulping)

1168
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,130
I should fucking beat the
life out you right now.

1169
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:51,333
But you ain't even
worth it. What?!

1170
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,601
(phone buzzing)

1171
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:53,436
Speak.

1172
00:52:53,437 --> 00:52:54,437
(William coughing)

1173
00:52:54,438 --> 00:52:56,539
- Get off. - What's good?

1174
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:59,009
(Sam gasping)

1175
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:04,146
- So I'ma ask you again. Was
that $10,000,000 worth it?

1176
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:06,248
- No. Of course not. - No?

1177
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:07,516
But it was when you thought
it was gon' help her

1178
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,818
take my company away
from me wasn't it?

1179
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:11,353
I should take your life.

1180
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:12,588
- I'll give her the money back.

1181
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:13,523
I swear to God-

1182
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:14,757
- I don't want you to do shit,

1183
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:15,858
but to get the fuck
outta my building

1184
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,526
'fore I kill yo weak ass.

1185
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:18,928
- But listen, I can get-

1186
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:21,865
- But nothing! Get
the fuck out! Now!

1187
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,235
- So this is it?

1188
00:53:28,104 --> 00:53:29,638
- Wait really?

1189
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:33,943
Just know I'm not gon' rest
until I make your life hell.

1190
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:37,613
So matter of fact, I think I'm
gon' rest real good tonight.

1191
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:39,148
- [William] What's that
supposed to mean, Adam?

1192
00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:42,818
- Check your accounts. Check
all three of your accounts.

1193
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:44,253
- What are you even talking...

1194
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:47,723
Where's all my money,
Adam? Where's all my money?

1195
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,291
- Yo' money?

1196
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:52,561
Oh, that $10,000,000
is back in my account

1197
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,663
and that $300,000 in change,

1198
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:56,665
oh, that's going to Cassandra

1199
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:59,001
and you, you going to jail.

1200
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:01,370
Your wife is gonna leave you

1201
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:02,972
and your kids are
gonna hate you.

1202
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:04,440
- Leave my kids-

1203
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:06,542
- I don't give a fuck if
them little bitches starve!

1204
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:08,611
And you lucky I don't
want your ugly ass wife

1205
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:11,080
or that bitch would
belong to me too.

1206
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:14,384
- Wake up! Your own wife
don't even belong to you.

1207
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:18,421
(intense music)

1208
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:25,894
Your boss has lost
his damn mind.

1209
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:26,830
- Really?

1210
00:54:26,831 --> 00:54:28,297
From where I'm standing,

1211
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:30,378
it looks like you're the
one that's lost their mind.

1212
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:31,734
Ah, just in time.

1213
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:32,935
- What the hell? - These

1214
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,370
two gentlemen would love to

1215
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:35,604
have you work with them.
- The hell is going on, Rich?

1216
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,207
- Insider trading, asshole.

1217
00:54:39,009 --> 00:54:42,177
- Is there anything
you want me to do?

1218
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:44,913
- Yeah, have William's
office cleant up?

1219
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:47,950
- [Automated Voice] You have
reached the voice mailbox of...

1220
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:51,120
(intense music)

1221
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,121
- You okay?

1222
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,790
- Yeah. Yeah. I'll be fine.

1223
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,993
I gotta grab my
jacket. I'll be back.

1224
00:54:57,994 --> 00:55:00,829
- Remember you have a meeting
in an hour with the lawyers.

1225
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:03,500
(intense music)

1226
00:55:05,268 --> 00:55:06,735
- Hey, how you doing, sir?

1227
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:08,637
- Hey, I'ma drive myself. You
go ahead up to the office.

1228
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,105
- You know I can't do that.

1229
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:11,707
You gotta have me and Rich
with you at all times.

1230
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:13,175
- Look Carlton, the
security is not for me.

1231
00:55:13,176 --> 00:55:14,510
It's for the people that think

1232
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:16,312
they might do something
to me, all right?

1233
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,746
I'm good. Go 'head.

1234
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:19,214
- Please, boss.

1235
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:22,251

good. Go ahead all right?

(slow orchestral music)

1244
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:11,367

1251
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:33,055
- Malik, who the

1252
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,390

1259
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,068
not giving a fuck about
our family, Malik.

1260
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:46,903

- Jasmine, what are you doing?

1266
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:03,385

- Man, where is you going?

you really gon' sit there

1370
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:14,996
and act like you
didn't kill that woman?

1371
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:17,933
- I didn't! I told you
I didn't touch her.

1372
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:19,501
- So why in the hell
your neighbors tell us

1373
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:21,069
they heard you two arguing, huh?

1374
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,205
They heard you say
you would kill her.

1375
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:24,740
- I would never say that, man.

1376
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,508
I'm a artist. I
don't hurt people.

1377
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:29,144
- Wait so you don't kill people?

1378
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:30,679
- [Malik] No!

1379
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:33,615
- So dead people just tend to
find their way into your home?

1380
01:02:33,616 --> 01:02:35,317
I'm gonna assume that
that's not her blood

1381
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:36,585
on you too, right?

1382
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,620
- Look it is. But I
didn't put it there.

1383
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:39,855
- [Detective Reed] Right.

1384
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:41,089
- Look, my partner
doesn't believe you

1385
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,258
because you were the
only person there alive.

1386
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:45,494
- No I wasn't. It was a
man. It was a man there.

1387
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:48,096
- A man? You gotta
give us more than that.

1388
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:50,265
Otherwise you fucking yourself.

1389
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:51,200
How did he look?

1390
01:02:51,201 --> 01:02:52,501
- Like a man.

1391
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:54,269
- Just admit that
you did this shit

1392
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,205
so I can go home to my husband.

1393
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:58,440
- Look,

1394
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:01,076
he had to be around
35 to 40 years.

1395
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:04,179
- Okay. And how tall
was this mystery man?

1396
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:07,984

", 5'11". I don't know.

1397
01:03:11,154 --> 01:03:12,654
- Get the fuck outta here.

1398
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:14,624
- It was just confirmed.

1399
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:19,961
- Do you realize
you just murdered

1400
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:22,798
one of Michigan's most
wealthiest people?

1401
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,833
- Reed, what are you
talking about? Fill me in.

1402
01:03:24,834 --> 01:03:26,868
- The dead woman
is Jaclyn Hewer.

1403
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:28,603
- Get the hell outta here.

1404
01:03:28,604 --> 01:03:30,038
Did you know you were banging

1405
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:32,541
one of the richest
women in Michigan?

1406
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:33,442
- Yeah. I guess.

1407
01:03:33,443 --> 01:03:35,110
- You guess? You guess?

1408
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:36,344
Ni-

1409
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:39,014
I'll be right back.
Johnson, come with me.

1410
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:41,416
Maybe Mr. Brown here can
come up with the truth

1411
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:42,951
by the time we come back.

1412
01:03:42,952 --> 01:03:46,321
- Look, I am telling the
truth. Okay? I loved her.

1413
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:47,589
Man I-

1414
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:50,091
Me and her didn't
have no problems.

1415
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:51,326
- You loved her?

1416
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:55,831
Aw, you loved her,
but you had a wife.

1417
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:57,365
So like I said,

1418
01:03:57,366 --> 01:04:00,535
you let us know when you
ready to tell me the truth.

1419
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:01,536
Let's go.

1420
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,908
Man I don't believe
anything that...

1421
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:09,277
I don't believe
anything he's saying.

1422
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:10,745
He killed that
woman in cold blood.

1423
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:12,581
Now we gotta find out why.

1424
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:14,115
- Well, what if he didn't do it?

1425
01:04:14,116 --> 01:04:16,685
- What? You must be
off your meds again.

1426
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,186
'Cause if he didn't do it,

1427
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:20,121
why is all that
blood on him, huh?

1428
01:04:20,122 --> 01:04:21,489
If he didn't do it,

1429
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:23,258
why was there so many
calls about the fight

1430
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:24,759
between them two?

1431
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,629
Come on Johnson. Please
explain all of this to me.

1432
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:29,164
- You're my partner.

1433
01:04:29,165 --> 01:04:30,665
If I have all the answers,
you will have 'em as well.

1434
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:34,469
My gut is telling me that
man did not kill that woman.

1435
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:37,539
- Yeah well I think
your gut is wrong.

1436
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,341
- He said another
man was there, right?

1437
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:40,876
- Right.

1438
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,744
- All I'm saying is maybe
we should look into that.

1439
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:44,246
See if there's any truth to it.

1440
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:47,649
- Okay. Well let's go question
him about the husband then.

1441
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:50,253
(somber music)

1442
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:01,931
- What in the hell
happened to you?

1443
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,201
- I killed my wife.

1444
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:07,669
- You what?

1445
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:09,839
Wait, wait. Hold on. Hold
on. W-w-what happened?

1446
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:15,443
- I caught her at
some dude house

1447
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:16,612
and I lost it.

1448
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:21,616
Damn, I fucking lost it,
man. I killed my wife.

1449
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:22,551
- [Rich] Hey. Hey.

1450
01:05:22,552 --> 01:05:23,718
- Man, what was I thinking?

1451
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:25,186
- Get yourself together
first. All right?

1452
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:26,755
Carlton, take the car.

1453
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:28,189
Have it cleaned from top
to bottom. All right?

1454
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:30,525
Make sure you switch the
plates. Okay? Come on.

1455
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:32,994
We gotta get you inside and
get you out of them clothes.

1456
01:05:32,995 --> 01:05:34,496
Get a bag.

1457
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:35,563
Put everything that you're
wearing inside that bag.

1458
01:05:35,564 --> 01:05:36,966
Oh and I'll take care of it.

1459
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:40,268
What'd you kill her with?

1460
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:42,872
(somber music)

1461
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:47,376
- Did anybody see you?

1462
01:05:48,644 --> 01:05:50,446
- Only dude she was fucking.

1463
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:53,649
- [Rich] Anybody else?

1464
01:05:55,251 --> 01:06:00,088
- No. I parked around the
corner. He the only person I saw.

1465
01:06:00,089 --> 01:06:02,191
- You got the address
on you? Let me get it.

1466
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:06,628
- All right.

1467
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:08,396
I'm gonna go check
the place out,

1468
01:06:08,397 --> 01:06:11,232
make sure there aren't
any cameras there, okay?

1469
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:13,501
- Rich, what am I gon' tell Sam?

1470
01:06:13,502 --> 01:06:15,303
- You don't have to
say anything, okay?

1471
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:17,806
You can't let anybody know
that you know that she's dead.

1472
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,074
All right?

1473
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:21,543
Now the cops and Sam are
both gonna be here soon

1474
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:23,845
and you have to put on the
best goddamn performance

1475
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:24,680
of your life today.

1476
01:06:24,681 --> 01:06:25,881
You understand me?

1477
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:28,717
- Yeah. I understand.

1478
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:31,119
- Let's go inside and get
you out of them clothes.

1479
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,689
(somber music)

1480
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:36,091
- [Detective Reed] Mr. Brown,

1481
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:38,193
how long have you been
seeing Jaclyn Hewer?

1482
01:06:38,194 --> 01:06:39,461
- A few weeks.

1483
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:42,063
- Were you two having
a sexual relationship?

1484
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:43,431
- Yeah.

1485
01:06:43,432 --> 01:06:46,301
- And how did your
wife feel about that?

1486
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:48,470
- Look, that's what I've
been trying to tell y'all.

1487
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:50,138
My wife walked in on us, okay?

1488
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:52,640
I went chasing after
her. We got to arguing.

1489
01:06:52,641 --> 01:06:54,075
That's what the neighbors heard.

1490
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:55,310
When I came back
in the building,

1491
01:06:55,311 --> 01:06:57,712
I saw a man dripping
in blood. (sighs)

1492
01:06:57,713 --> 01:06:59,781
When he left, I ran in
there trying to save her,

1493
01:06:59,782 --> 01:07:01,249
But she was already gone.

1494
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:03,752
- [Detective Johnson] Can
you describe that man?

1495
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:07,922
- Look, he was
like 5'10 " 5'11".

1496
01:07:07,923 --> 01:07:09,157
Bald head.

1497
01:07:09,158 --> 01:07:11,226
Looks like he wear
suits all the time.

1498
01:07:11,227 --> 01:07:13,061
Lil' preppy looking dude.

1499
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:14,062
Um,

1500
01:07:15,664 --> 01:07:17,132
that's him!

1501
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:19,467
That's the dude that rubbed
blood on me. That's him!

1502
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:20,969
- So he wiped blood on you?

1503
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:23,004
- Yes! That's what I've
been trying to tell y'all.

1504
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:24,406
- Okay. We'll be back.

1505
01:07:24,407 --> 01:07:27,076
(intense music)

1506
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:34,315
We have to get a warrant now

1507
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:36,084
before he destroys
all the evidence.

1508
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:37,852
- I guess your gut was right.

1509
01:07:37,853 --> 01:07:39,120

- Officer Williams.

1525
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:20,862
- How we doing today, Rich?

1526
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:23,131
- I'm okay. How's that
new daughter of yours?

1527
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:26,101
- Oh, beautiful man. The
wife couldn't be happier.

1528
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,036
- That's...

1529
01:08:27,037 --> 01:08:28,236
- Could've used a boy though.

1530
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:30,105
- Ah, couldn't we all, huh?

1531
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,506
Now you know what
they say though?

1532
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:33,775
It is never too early
to start a college.

1533
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,577
- I can't argue with that.

1534
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:36,945
- Have yourself a
good night, Williams.

1535
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:37,946
- You too.

1536
01:08:40,583 --> 01:08:44,185
- Look around. This
place is a mess.

1537
01:08:44,186 --> 01:08:46,654
But what's one
thing you don't see?

1538
01:08:46,655 --> 01:08:48,156
- [Detective Johnson]
I don't know. What?

1539
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:52,227
- Fingerprints, all this
blood, not a fingerprint,

1540
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:53,761
a boot print anywhere.

1541
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:55,463
- You are absolutely right.

1542
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:58,032
- He killed her and he thinks
he's getting away with it.

1543
01:08:58,033 --> 01:09:01,836
- He had to make a mistake.
There is no perfect murder.

1544
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:05,173
- Look, I'm telling you I
didn't do it. All right?

1545
01:09:05,174 --> 01:09:08,009
It's the dude that's
on TV. All right?

1546
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:10,545
He was coming outta my
building, shirt bloody.

1547
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:14,349
His eyes had fire in it,
man. He was gon' kill me.

1548
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:15,717
The only reason he
ain't let that gun off

1549
01:09:15,718 --> 01:09:16,784
'cause he knew it
would've been a wrap.

1550
01:09:16,785 --> 01:09:18,119
Everybody would've seen him.

1551
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,421
- So are there any
cameras in the building?

1552
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:23,092
(intense music)

1553
01:09:29,231 --> 01:09:32,967
Hey. I need you to
go over to Malik's.

1554
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:34,869
Take a look around the building

1555
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:37,071
and tell me if there
are any cameras

1556
01:09:37,072 --> 01:09:39,207
that would've caught
the other guy running.

1557
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:41,877

01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,387

1562
01:09:58,928 --> 01:10:02,030

it so why would he kill her?

of them cars out there.

- Excuse me?

1673
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:52,588
- You killed your wife,
didn't you? It's all over you.

1674
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:57,793
You murdered your wife
and I'm gonna prove it.

1675
01:14:59,127 --> 01:15:01,863
- I don't got nothing
else to say to you

1676
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:03,664
until my lawyer gets here.

1677
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:08,202

less. I'll see you soon.

1679
01:15:15,978 --> 01:15:18,913

1680
01:15:18,914 --> 01:15:19,748
- Yes,

1681
01:15:19,749 --> 01:15:21,182
I did.

1682
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:24,620
And to say that she's
angry is an understatement.

1683
01:15:25,487 --> 01:15:28,789
- I'm sitting here facing murder

1684
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:32,727
while the woman I really love
is out there dying slowly.

1685
01:15:32,728 --> 01:15:34,128
- Look,

1686
01:15:34,129 --> 01:15:35,363
I get it.

1687
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:38,833
And I understand,
but I gotta ask,

1688
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:40,167
did you do it?

1689
01:15:40,168 --> 01:15:42,470
- Really? I really gotta
answer that question?

1690
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:45,339
- Yes, because I
need you to assure me

1691
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:47,875
that I'm fighting for the
life of an innocent man.

1692
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:50,645
- That son of a bitch
did it. I just know it

1693
01:15:50,646 --> 01:15:53,047
- Now you see what I
mean? The gut never lies.

1694
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:54,315
- How do we prove it?

1695
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:57,084
- We have to see if the
clothes come back clean

1696
01:15:57,085 --> 01:15:58,319
along with the vehicle.

1697
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,787
If he really did it,

1698
01:15:59,788 --> 01:16:01,355
he wouldn't have had time
to clean everything up

1699
01:16:01,356 --> 01:16:02,790
and get rid of his clothes.

1700
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:04,926
We do know one of
'em murdered her,

1701
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:06,694
but if we have the wrong one,

1702
01:16:06,695 --> 01:16:08,596
the other one's gonna
have ample enough time

1703
01:16:08,597 --> 01:16:10,064
to clean up all his mistakes.

1704
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:11,065
- Let's go.

1705
01:16:13,502 --> 01:16:14,735
- Excuse me.

1706
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:17,805
- Excuse me? Is that
one of the Hewer cars?

1707
01:16:17,806 --> 01:16:19,073
- Yes. Why?

1708
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:21,108
- Because if it is,
we need to seize it.

1709
01:16:21,109 --> 01:16:23,544
- Oh. Have at it. Nice catch.

1710

our heads for this.

1713

- Hey son. Can I talk
to you for a minute?

1714
01:16:32,854 --> 01:16:37,358
- Yes. What's wrong?

1715
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:40,227
- I really don't know
how to tell you this.

1716
01:16:40,228 --> 01:16:41,228
- Tell me what?

1720

- (huffs) Yeah. I'm
scared to tell you.

1721
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:54,275
- Tell me what?

1722
01:16:57,846 --> 01:17:00,382
- God called your
mom home today.

1723
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:02,751
- Wait, what do you mean?

1724
01:17:04,853 --> 01:17:09,056
- Your mom is in heaven
son. She died today.

1725
01:17:09,057 --> 01:17:10,057
- What happened?

1726
01:17:10,058 --> 01:17:13,594
- (sighs) Look, I don't know.

1727
01:17:13,595 --> 01:17:17,732
But, son I promise you
everything is gonna be okay.

1728
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:21,603
And I promise you that I'm
gon' be here for you. Okay?

1729
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:26,474
- Dad, I don't know what
I'm gonna do without her.

1730
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,175
I'm gonna miss her.

She's still gon' be here son

right here in your heart.

1734
01:17:38,553 --> 01:17:42,123
And whenever you need to
talk to her, you just talk.

1735
01:17:42,124 --> 01:17:44,593
She's in heaven, son.
She gon' hear you.

1736
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:48,429
It's okay.

1739
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:57,371
Great.

1740
01:17:57,372 --> 01:18:00,841
Now the whole world knows
that you're here for murder.

1741
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:05,312
- What are my kids gon think?
Mom about to throw a fit.

1742
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:07,481
- (scoffs) Seriously?

1743
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:10,284
You worried about your
mommy having a fit?

1744
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:12,186
Malik, you got
much bigger things

1745
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:14,155
to worry about than
that right now.

1746
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:15,556
This is your life.

1747
01:18:15,557 --> 01:18:18,125
- I know that! The hell
I'm even talking about?

1748
01:18:18,126 --> 01:18:19,627
- Look, I'm just
simply trying to say

1749
01:18:19,628 --> 01:18:22,363
that we have to find
some kind of proof

1750
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:23,664
that you didn't do this.

1751
01:18:23,665 --> 01:18:27,001
- Look. Ask my wife.
I was with her.

1752
01:18:27,002 --> 01:18:28,502
All right? We got
into a argument.

1753
01:18:28,503 --> 01:18:29,970
I chased her out
of the building.

1754
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:32,406
When I came back in,
Jaclyn was already dead.

1755
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:35,710
I keep telling all y'all the
same story. Nobody listening.

1756
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:37,344
I'm only guilty of
two things here.

1757
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:39,714
- Yeah and what's that?

1758
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:43,951
- Cheating on my wife and
sleeping with a married woman.

1759
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:46,220
- Me and my kids just
watched the fucking news

1760
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:47,922
and my husband is
here for murder?

1761
01:18:47,923 --> 01:18:49,356
He didn't kill nobody!

1762
01:18:49,357 --> 01:18:52,293
- Ma'am calm down. What's
your husband's name?

1763
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:54,929
- His name is Malik
Brown. He's an artist.

1764
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:56,864
He's supposed to have
killed some rich bitch.

1765
01:18:56,865 --> 01:18:58,399
He didn't kill that bitch.

1766
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,267
She was still alive when he
chased me outta his studio.

1767
01:19:00,268 --> 01:19:02,369
- Okay, well the detectives
working that case

1768
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:04,705
aren't here right now, but
if you wanna have a seat,

1769
01:19:04,706 --> 01:19:06,006
I'll find out when
they're back, okay?

1770
01:19:06,007 --> 01:19:08,142
(Jasmine huffs)

1771
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:10,711
- Look, give me
your wife's address.

1772
01:19:10,712 --> 01:19:12,146
Because at this point,

1773
01:19:12,147 --> 01:19:15,616
she may be the only person
that could help you.

1774
01:19:15,617 --> 01:19:17,519
- Wouldn't hold your breath.

1775
01:19:19,221 --> 01:19:22,056
- Malik, look, she loves you

1776
01:19:22,057 --> 01:19:24,191
and I'm sure she
wouldn't wanna see you

1777
01:19:24,192 --> 01:19:26,360
go to prison for a
murder you didn't do.

1778
01:19:26,361 --> 01:19:30,397
Look, just sit tight and
let me take care of this.

1779
01:19:30,398 --> 01:19:33,068
(intense music)

1780
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:37,872
Excuse me. Are you Mrs. Brown?

1781
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:39,340
- And who are you?

1782
01:19:39,341 --> 01:19:42,376
- I'm Patrice Gatz. I believe
I'm your husband's lawyer.

1783
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:43,878
- Malik?

1784
01:19:43,879 --> 01:19:46,614
- Yes. I was actually on
my way over to your house.

1785
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:48,149
- I'm here trying to figure out

1786
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:50,584
why the fuck my husband is
being charged with murder.

1787
01:19:50,585 --> 01:19:53,354
My house is a fucking zoo.
My kids is distraught.

1788
01:19:53,355 --> 01:19:56,657
My phone won't stop ringing.
My husband did not kill anyone!

1789
01:19:56,658 --> 01:19:59,461
- Okay. Can you hold on
a second for me, please?

1790
01:20:01,196 --> 01:20:02,630
- [Attorney Gatz] Excuse me?

1791
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,165
- [Police] Yes?

1792
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:05,866
- [Attorney Gatz] I'm Patrice
Gatz, Malik Brown's attorney.

1793
01:20:05,867 --> 01:20:07,268
Is there somewhere that
I can speak to his wife

1794
01:20:07,269 --> 01:20:08,502
in private please?

1795
01:20:08,503 --> 01:20:09,404
- Oh yes ma'am. I
can take you there.

1796
01:20:09,405 --> 01:20:10,405
- Thank you.

1797
01:20:12,207 --> 01:20:14,709
Miss Brown, come with me please.

1798
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:20,314
- All right. Truck is clean.

1799
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:22,516
Everything is all good fellas.

1800
01:20:22,517 --> 01:20:25,654
- Are you sure? I mean, I
know there was a lot blood.

1801
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:30,225
I don't know what I'ma do
without her. What's the plan?

1802
01:20:31,693 --> 01:20:34,061
- You gotta get
yourself together, boss.

1803
01:20:34,062 --> 01:20:35,596
Everything is taken care of.

1804
01:20:35,597 --> 01:20:37,498
- That's what we're here for.

1805
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:40,267
To protect you and the company.

1806
01:20:40,268 --> 01:20:43,904
- Look, I appreciate
that fellas,

1807
01:20:43,905 --> 01:20:47,541
but I seen all those crime shows

1808
01:20:47,542 --> 01:20:49,910
and I know it's no such
thing as a perfect murder.

1809
01:20:49,911 --> 01:20:52,981
- Ah, but there is such
thing as a perfect cover up.

1810
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:57,384
Hm. Speaking of which,
how did you find her?

1811
01:20:57,385 --> 01:21:00,120
- We share locations. I
always knew where she was.

1812
01:21:00,121 --> 01:21:01,121
- Damn.

1813
01:21:03,491 --> 01:21:05,292
Did you take any calls?

1814
01:21:05,293 --> 01:21:06,760
- What?

1815
01:21:06,761 --> 01:21:09,930
- Did you take any calls or use
the internet for any reason?

1816
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:12,333
- I used the map app.

1817
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:13,567
- Fuck man.

1818
01:21:13,568 --> 01:21:15,035
- Right? All right.

1819
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:18,372
Gimme your phone. Use your
work phone, all right?

1820
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:20,975
If anybody asks,
Jax had your phone.

1821
01:21:20,976 --> 01:21:23,043
- But I have my
phone up until now.

1822
01:21:23,044 --> 01:21:25,012
What do I say when
they ask me about that?

1823
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:28,249
- Nothing. Nothing at all.
You say nothing to nobody.

1824
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:29,750
- Won't that make
me look guilty?

1825
01:21:29,751 --> 01:21:32,920
- You already look guilty.
Have you seen the news?

1826
01:21:32,921 --> 01:21:34,855
They said she was messing
around with her lover

1827
01:21:34,856 --> 01:21:36,857
and all of a sudden,
she ended up dead.

1828
01:21:36,858 --> 01:21:39,493
Now they tryna blame
her billionaire husband.

1829
01:21:39,494 --> 01:21:42,062
- I can't believe this.

1830
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:45,633
Sam is gonna hate me if he
think I hurt his mother.

1831
01:21:45,634 --> 01:21:46,867
- That's why we gon' make sure

1832
01:21:46,868 --> 01:21:48,435
that motherfucker
take the blame for it.

1833
01:21:48,436 --> 01:21:50,137
- Listen, these charges

1834
01:21:50,138 --> 01:21:52,373
that they have against
Malik are serious.

1835
01:21:52,374 --> 01:21:54,508
So is there anything that
you know that could help him?

1836
01:21:54,509 --> 01:21:55,910
I mean anything?

1837
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:58,012
- Yes, that man that
was on the news,

1838
01:21:58,013 --> 01:21:59,813
he is the one that did this.

1839
01:21:59,814 --> 01:22:02,549
I seen him leaving Malik's
studio with a blue shirt on

1840
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:05,552
and it was bloody and he
had something in his hand

1841
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:07,488
and he was also, he was crying.

1842
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:09,757
And then I seen him
hop into a black truck.

1843
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:12,626
And now I'm being
told that Malik

1844
01:22:12,627 --> 01:22:16,063
is 'bout to be charged for
the murder of his wife?

1845
01:22:16,064 --> 01:22:20,668
I just, I don't understand,
like Malik wouldn't kill anyone.

1846
01:22:20,669 --> 01:22:23,570
- And are you willing to
write this out in a statement?

1847
01:22:23,571 --> 01:22:24,738
- Hell yeah, I am.

1848
01:22:24,739 --> 01:22:27,975
I love Malik and
yes, he hurt me,

1849
01:22:27,976 --> 01:22:30,177
but I still love my husband.

1850
01:22:30,178 --> 01:22:33,914
- Good. You know, I'll
be right back. Okay?

1851
01:22:33,915 --> 01:22:36,850
- Man, I still can't believe
she was really cheating on you.

1852
01:22:36,851 --> 01:22:38,018
Are you okay?

1853
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:40,922
- No, I'm not okay!
I'm fucked up!

1854
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:44,960
And the bad part is

1855
01:22:45,994 --> 01:22:47,796
I love her so much.

1856
01:22:49,230 --> 01:22:52,900
Why she messed around on
me? What was it about him?

1857
01:22:52,901 --> 01:22:53,868
- Look, boss,

1858
01:22:53,869 --> 01:22:55,135
you don't need to be thinking

1859
01:22:55,136 --> 01:22:57,237
about that kind of stuff
right now, all right?

1860
01:22:57,238 --> 01:22:58,605
Go get yourself some rest.

1861
01:22:58,606 --> 01:23:01,408
We'll meet you in the
morning, okay? Let's go.

1862
01:23:01,409 --> 01:23:03,078
- I'ma get no sleep tonight.

1863
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:07,014
- So you mean to tell me

1864
01:23:07,015 --> 01:23:09,850
you saw Adam Hewer
in a bloody outfit?

1865
01:23:09,851 --> 01:23:12,553
- Yes, I seen that
clown in a bloody outfit

1866
01:23:12,554 --> 01:23:14,021
and he was crying.

1867
01:23:14,022 --> 01:23:16,290
- You're Malik's wife.
Why should we believe you?

1868
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:19,259
- Why should you believe me?
Because I have it on my phone.

1869
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:20,095
- Show me.

1870
01:23:20,096 --> 01:23:21,729
(Jasmine scoffs)

1871
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:23,063
- Here.

1872
01:23:23,064 --> 01:23:24,032
The fuck?

1873
01:23:24,033 --> 01:23:26,701
(intense music)

1874
01:23:27,802 --> 01:23:29,036
- Was that him?

1875
01:23:29,037 --> 01:23:30,871
- Yeah. That's that nigga.
- Damn.

1876
01:23:30,872 --> 01:23:32,272
I mean, you know it's him,

1877
01:23:32,273 --> 01:23:35,009
but you can't
really see his face.

1878
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:36,243
Damn it. - I told you

1879
01:23:36,244 --> 01:23:37,478
it was a gut call.

1880
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:39,513
That son of a bitch
took his wife's life.

1881
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:41,815
Mrs. Brown, thank you.

1882
01:23:41,816 --> 01:23:43,250
- Thank me?

1883
01:23:43,251 --> 01:23:44,451
So are y'all gonna
let my husband

1884
01:23:44,452 --> 01:23:46,153
outta that fucking jail cell?

1885
01:23:46,154 --> 01:23:47,354
- I can't,

1886
01:23:47,355 --> 01:23:48,622
but I am gonna
check the evidence

1887
01:23:48,623 --> 01:23:49,823
to make sure none of
her blood shows up.

1888
01:23:49,824 --> 01:23:52,059
- But y'all see
that it's not Malik.

1889
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:54,061
- But you don't see his face.

1890
01:23:54,062 --> 01:23:56,830
We can know it's him, but
with no concrete proof,

1891
01:23:56,831 --> 01:23:57,665
our hands are tied.

1892
01:23:57,666 --> 01:23:58,932
It's nothing we can do.

1893
01:23:58,933 --> 01:24:00,801
- No. What y'all can do
is let my husband out.

1894
01:24:00,802 --> 01:24:01,869
- Now calm down.

1895
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:03,103
- Calm down?

1896
01:24:03,104 --> 01:24:05,239
- Now you want us to
let him go, right?

1897
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:08,575
But he has her blood all over
him, so it's not that easy.

1898
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:11,478
- Y'all two see this is
clearly some bullshit.

1899
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:12,946
- Nah.

1900
01:24:12,947 --> 01:24:15,749
What's some bullshit is he
had a dead woman in his place.

1901
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:17,618
That's the thing
that's some bullshit.

1902
01:24:17,619 --> 01:24:21,989
Furthermore, I feel bad for
him, but we're doing our job.

1903
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:23,891
We're doing everything we can

1904
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:26,226
to make sure the right
person pays for this.

1905
01:24:26,227 --> 01:24:29,530
- Make sure you two do
y'all fucking job right.

1906
01:24:29,531 --> 01:24:30,965
Do you hear me?
Get outta my way.

1907
01:24:33,001 --> 01:24:35,602
(doorbell ringing)

1908
01:24:35,603 --> 01:24:38,206
(somber music)

1909
01:24:42,143 --> 01:24:43,511
- Mom, I'm so sorry, mom.

1910
01:24:44,345 --> 01:24:46,780
- You son of a bitch.

1911
01:24:46,781 --> 01:24:50,017
I know you killed my daughter
and I'm gon' prove it

1912
01:24:50,018 --> 01:24:52,152
if it's the last thing I do.

1913
01:24:52,153 --> 01:24:54,722
(somber music)

1914
01:25:09,003 --> 01:25:11,673
(fist pounding)

1915
01:25:14,309 --> 01:25:16,610
(alarm beeping)

1916
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:18,312
- Can we come in?

1917
01:25:18,313 --> 01:25:20,747
- Look, I told you two
everything yesterday.

1918
01:25:20,748 --> 01:25:22,884
- We just have a
few more questions.

1919
01:25:24,219 --> 01:25:25,219
- Come in.

1920
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:28,388
(intense music)

1921
01:25:28,389 --> 01:25:29,623
How can I help you?

1922
01:25:29,624 --> 01:25:31,825
- You know Mr. Hewer
murdered his wife.

1923
01:25:31,826 --> 01:25:33,093
So why are you covering for him?

1924
01:25:33,094 --> 01:25:34,828
- I'm not covering for anybody.

1925
01:25:34,829 --> 01:25:36,697
Matter of fact, I don't
have a reason to lie to you.

1926
01:25:36,698 --> 01:25:38,132
- Looks to me like
you're moving.

1927
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:39,633
- I am.

1928
01:25:39,634 --> 01:25:42,870
The Hewers bought me a home so
I'm moving in and unpacking.

1929
01:25:42,871 --> 01:25:44,404
- Look, we know
you're lying to us

1930
01:25:44,405 --> 01:25:45,572
and you will go to jail for it.

1931
01:25:45,573 --> 01:25:47,141
Is that what you really want?

1932
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:49,209
Do you really wanna
go to jail for a man

1933
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:51,345
who murdered his own
wife in cold blood?

1934
01:25:51,346 --> 01:25:52,813
- Look, I told you all I know.

1935
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:55,549
And what I know is that man
did not murder his wife.

1936
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:58,585
So if you two can excuse
me, I got things to do.

1937
01:25:58,586 --> 01:26:00,087
- How long have you
worked for them?

1938
01:26:00,088 --> 01:26:01,055
- Why?

1939
01:26:01,056 --> 01:26:03,157
- Because is this him?

1940
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:06,860
You know it's him
'cause he murdered her.

1941
01:26:06,861 --> 01:26:08,896
He killed her and now
there's an innocent man

1942
01:26:08,897 --> 01:26:11,064
in jail right now, worried
that he's gonna do time

1943
01:26:11,065 --> 01:26:13,000
for her death.
- I told you he was at home.

1944
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:15,602
- He murdered her. Now
stop lying for him.

1945
01:26:15,603 --> 01:26:16,703
- He was with my daughter.

1946
01:26:16,704 --> 01:26:17,704
- Your daughter? - Yes.

1947
01:26:17,705 --> 01:26:18,772
- Yeah. Okay.

1948
01:26:18,773 --> 01:26:20,407
- Look, she works for them.

1949
01:26:20,408 --> 01:26:21,742
- And what's your
daughter's name?

1950
01:26:21,743 --> 01:26:22,876
- Nikki Sloan.

1951
01:26:22,877 --> 01:26:24,044
- Where is she now?

1952
01:26:24,045 --> 01:26:25,846
- She's at the Hewers'.
She's their nanny.

1953
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:27,948
She's the woman he's
been sleeping with.

1954
01:26:27,949 --> 01:26:30,717
And before you even ask, yes,
Mrs. Hewer knew all about it.

1955
01:26:30,718 --> 01:26:34,221
Matter of fact, they've been
together numerous of times.

1956
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:38,125
- You know what? You the worst
mother I ever met in my life.

1957
01:26:38,126 --> 01:26:41,929
'Cause you know he killed
her and you covering for him.

1958
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:44,131
- It's time for you to go.

1959
01:26:44,132 --> 01:26:46,701
(gloomy music)

1960
01:26:50,438 --> 01:26:52,739
(Debra sighs)

1961
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:55,410
(phone beeping)

1962
01:26:56,277 --> 01:26:58,947
(phone buzzing)

1963
01:27:02,684 --> 01:27:03,917
- Hello?

1964
01:27:03,918 --> 01:27:06,486
- Hey babe. Who, who,
who you there with?

1965
01:27:06,487 --> 01:27:08,055
- Nobody, Ma. What's going on?

1966
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:10,791
- Listen, baby. (sighs)

1967
01:27:10,792 --> 01:27:12,360
Adam actually killed Jaclyn.

1968
01:27:13,528 --> 01:27:14,528
- Oh my God.

1969
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:16,898
What the fuck?

1970
01:27:18,633 --> 01:27:21,335
He's downstairs talking
to his lawyer right now.

1971
01:27:21,336 --> 01:27:23,837
You want me to take Sammy
and go to the police?

1972
01:27:23,838 --> 01:27:25,940
- No. (sighs)

1973
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:28,075
I want you to fuck him.

1974
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:29,576
- What?

1975
01:27:29,577 --> 01:27:31,011
- Matter of fact, I need
you to make him your man.

1976
01:27:31,012 --> 01:27:32,480
- Are you crazy?

1977
01:27:33,615 --> 01:27:35,682
I'm not doing that.

1978
01:27:35,683 --> 01:27:36,984
- Oh yes, you are gon' do it.

1979
01:27:36,985 --> 01:27:39,186
Baby, that man is 'bout
to be a billionaire.

1980
01:27:39,187 --> 01:27:41,088
Baby he could change
our lives forever

1981
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:43,624
and we will never have
another opportunity like this.

1982
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:45,893
- I'm hungry. Can you
make me something to eat?

1983
01:27:47,528 --> 01:27:49,796
- Mama, I am not doing that.

1984
01:27:49,797 --> 01:27:53,200
- Baby, we will lose
everything we have.

1985
01:27:53,201 --> 01:27:55,602
Okay? If that man goes to jail.

1986
01:27:55,603 --> 01:27:59,373
Now he just may beat this
case, but he may go to jail.

1987
01:27:59,374 --> 01:28:03,010
Nikki, we know how much
that man love his wife.

1988
01:28:03,011 --> 01:28:04,845
He was the best husband to her.

1989
01:28:04,846 --> 01:28:08,915
We talked about it all
the time, but baby,

1990
01:28:08,916 --> 01:28:11,618
we will never have
another opportunity

1991
01:28:11,619 --> 01:28:14,554
for this man to change
our world, okay?

1992
01:28:14,555 --> 01:28:17,924
- Look, I gotta make him
something to eat real quick.

1993
01:28:17,925 --> 01:28:19,793
I'll call you back in a minute.

1994
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:23,163
- Nikki, you don't want
that baby growing up

1995
01:28:23,164 --> 01:28:25,132
without his parents, right?

1996
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:28,635
And besides, you
can't even have kids.

1997
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:30,904
- Why would you bring
that up right now?

1998
01:28:30,905 --> 01:28:33,573
- Because we will never
have this chance again.

1999
01:28:33,574 --> 01:28:35,976
And this is your opportunity
to have the world.

2000
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:39,479
Baby, a good man,
a beautiful home,

2001
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:43,383
and a son that you
can raise to be great.

2002
01:28:43,384 --> 01:28:46,620
- Mom, I gotta go. I call
you back in a minute.

2003
01:28:46,621 --> 01:28:50,090
(intense music)

2004
01:28:50,091 --> 01:28:50,925
Fuck.

2005
01:28:50,926 --> 01:28:51,926
Fuck.

2006
01:28:51,926 --> 01:28:52,894
Fuck.

2007
01:28:52,895 --> 01:28:54,195
The fuck?

2008
01:28:55,563 --> 01:28:57,931
(Adam sighing)

2009
01:28:57,932 --> 01:29:00,535
(intense music)

2010
01:29:03,371 --> 01:29:05,038
- Did you kill her?

2011
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:06,039
- No.

2012
01:29:07,608 --> 01:29:10,210
- (sighs) Looking at
the three of you guys,

2013
01:29:10,211 --> 01:29:11,712
I think you're lying.

2014
01:29:11,713 --> 01:29:15,482
I think you did and I have
to have complete honesty

2015
01:29:15,483 --> 01:29:16,750
or I can't help you.

2016
01:29:16,751 --> 01:29:21,154
In fact, I won't help
you if you lie to me.

2017
01:29:21,155 --> 01:29:24,324
- Look, he's one of the
only lawyers I trust

2018
01:29:24,325 --> 01:29:25,859
in this area, all right?

2019
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:28,529
(intense music)

2020
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:33,700
- Yeah, I did it.

2021
01:29:34,736 --> 01:29:36,603
- All right. Now we're talking.

2022
01:29:36,604 --> 01:29:39,072
We gotta get you
an airtight alibi.

2023
01:29:39,073 --> 01:29:41,675
What did you tell the detectives
when you talked to 'em?

2024
01:29:41,676 --> 01:29:43,410
- I didn't.

2025
01:29:43,411 --> 01:29:44,411
- Good

2026
01:29:45,446 --> 01:29:47,381
and here's the thing.

2027
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:49,884
The police have
to charge somebody

2028
01:29:50,818 --> 01:29:52,219
with murdering your wife.

2029
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:55,655
Right now, the news
is going crazy.

2030
01:29:55,656 --> 01:29:57,892
I mean, it's the top
story in the country.

2031
01:29:59,927 --> 01:30:04,932
From here on out, you don't
say anything to anyone,

2032
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:06,601
especially the police.

2033
01:30:06,602 --> 01:30:08,201
And that goes for all of you.

2034
01:30:08,202 --> 01:30:11,606
I'm the only one that'll
have any contact with 'em.

2035
01:30:13,741 --> 01:30:18,012
That's gonna cost you about
$500,000 if this goes to trial.

2036
01:30:20,348 --> 01:30:24,017
- Well hopefully I don't
even have to go to trial.

2037
01:30:24,018 --> 01:30:25,619
- Right. Exactly.

2038
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:27,921
So just let us know
whatever you need us to do.

2039
01:30:27,922 --> 01:30:30,024
And I'll take care of it.

2040
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:32,159
- I will.

2041
01:30:32,994 --> 01:30:36,363
(doorbell ringing)

2042
01:30:36,364 --> 01:30:37,631
- Come with me.

2043
01:30:37,632 --> 01:30:40,301
(intense music)

2044
01:30:47,241 --> 01:30:48,775
- Just a minute!

2045
01:30:48,776 --> 01:30:51,412
(intense music)

2046
01:31:01,255 --> 01:31:02,656
Hello, can I help you?

2047
01:31:02,657 --> 01:31:03,990
- [Detective Reed] We're
here to see Mr. Hewer.

2048
01:31:03,991 --> 01:31:06,026
- Well, he's actually
in a meeting right now.

2049
01:31:06,027 --> 01:31:08,962
- I don't give a damn.
You tell him we're here.

2050
01:31:08,963 --> 01:31:10,797
- What the hell is going on now?

2051
01:31:10,798 --> 01:31:12,732
This is starting
to be harassment.

2052
01:31:12,733 --> 01:31:15,235
- I'm representing
Mr. Hewer right now.

2053
01:31:15,236 --> 01:31:19,072
Anything you say to him has
to be done in my presence.

2054
01:31:19,073 --> 01:31:20,007
Understood?

2055
01:31:20,008 --> 01:31:22,642
- Yes sir. But you here now.

2056
01:31:22,643 --> 01:31:25,278
So I just need one
thing answered.

2057
01:31:25,279 --> 01:31:29,015
Mr. Hewer, where were you
when your wife was murdered?

2058
01:31:29,016 --> 01:31:30,650
- You don't have to answer that.

2059
01:31:30,651 --> 01:31:34,421
- Look. He was with me
at my place, making love.

2060
01:31:34,422 --> 01:31:35,856
That's where we always at.

2061
01:31:35,857 --> 01:31:37,757
- So you just gon' lie for him?

2062
01:31:37,758 --> 01:31:39,993
Your mother put you up
to this, didn't she?

2063
01:31:39,994 --> 01:31:43,196
- No, I would never do
that. I actually love him.

2064
01:31:43,197 --> 01:31:45,867
(intense music)

2065
01:31:48,002 --> 01:31:49,069
- On your way.

2066
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:51,706
(intense music)

2067
01:31:55,009 --> 01:31:57,512
If they come back, let me know.

2068
01:31:58,412 --> 01:31:59,412
- Will do.

2069
01:32:01,482 --> 01:32:03,149
Thank you.

2070
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:06,486
- Nah don't thank
me. Thank my mama.

2071
01:32:06,487 --> 01:32:08,488
And most of all, thank your son,

2072
01:32:08,489 --> 01:32:10,690
'cause I'll do anything
for that little boy.

2073
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:12,926
- Look, I swear I'ma
do right by him.

2074
01:32:12,927 --> 01:32:16,797
- No you gon' do right by all
of us and you bet not hurt me.

2075
01:32:17,932 --> 01:32:18,999
- Consider it done.

2076
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,669
(intense music)

2077
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:25,005
- You know she's lying, right?

2078
01:32:25,006 --> 01:32:28,608
- There's nothing we can do
about it. You have to let it go.

2079
01:32:28,609 --> 01:32:31,945
All the evidence is
pointing at Mr. Brown.

2080
01:32:31,946 --> 01:32:34,481
I guess that's karma,
his punishment,

2081
01:32:34,482 --> 01:32:36,349
for sleeping with
that man's wife.

2082
01:32:36,350 --> 01:32:37,584
- Still not right.

2083
01:32:37,585 --> 01:32:40,254
(intense music)

2084
01:32:41,289 --> 01:32:42,756
- Malik Brown,

2085
01:32:42,757 --> 01:32:45,692
you have been accused of
the murder of Jaclyn Hewer.

2086
01:32:45,693 --> 01:32:46,960
How do you plead?

2087
01:32:46,961 --> 01:32:48,461
- I didn't do it.
I didn't kill her.

2088
01:32:48,462 --> 01:32:51,665
- Miss Gatz, please get
your client under control.

2089
01:32:51,666 --> 01:32:55,335
- Calm down. My
apologies, your honor.

2090
01:32:55,336 --> 01:32:57,137
My client pleads not guilty.

2091
01:32:57,138 --> 01:33:00,473
- People of the state,
how are you on bail?

2092
01:33:00,474 --> 01:33:03,510
- Mr. Brown beat his
mistress to death

2093
01:33:03,511 --> 01:33:06,313
because she was leaving
him and telling his wife.

2094
01:33:06,314 --> 01:33:08,315
- That bitch lying!
I didn't do that!

2095
01:33:08,316 --> 01:33:11,017
- Mrs. Gatz, please
inform your client

2096
01:33:11,018 --> 01:33:14,554
he is not at a backyard
barbecue at his mama's house.

2097
01:33:14,555 --> 01:33:17,123
This is a courtroom,
my courtroom.

2098
01:33:17,124 --> 01:33:19,459
And if he doesn't get
his self under control,

2099
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:21,895
I will have him hog
tied and muzzled.

2100
01:33:21,896 --> 01:33:24,097
- Again, my
apologies, your honor.

2101
01:33:24,098 --> 01:33:26,499
- Mrs. Fields, please continue.

2102
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:28,234
- Thank you, your honor.

2103
01:33:28,235 --> 01:33:31,371
We're asking for
bail of $1,000,000.

2104
01:33:31,372 --> 01:33:32,872
- That is crazy.

2105
01:33:32,873 --> 01:33:35,675
Your honor, Mr. Brown does
not have that kind of money.

2106
01:33:35,676 --> 01:33:36,977
- That's the point.

2107
01:33:36,978 --> 01:33:40,981
Mr. Brown, your bail
is set at $1,000,000.

2108
01:33:40,982 --> 01:33:41,982
- Fuck you.

2109
01:33:43,284 --> 01:33:46,186
- Well, that's something you
won't be doing for a while.

2110
01:33:46,187 --> 01:33:49,357
At least not with women.
Court's adjourned.

2111
01:33:50,491 --> 01:33:53,160

2112
01:33:58,232 --> 01:34:00,935

2113
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:05,905
- I did it.

2114
01:34:05,906 --> 01:34:07,707
- [Attorney Wells] All
right. Now we talkin'.

2115
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:10,645
We gotta get you
an airtight alibi.

(phone tone ringing)

2118
01:34:14,882 --> 01:34:16,983
- [Operator] 911.
What's your emergency?

2119
01:34:16,984 --> 01:34:20,553
- I know who killed my
mother, Jaclyn Hewer.

2120
01:34:20,554 --> 01:34:24,925
