1
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:24,817
Come on.

2
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,820
Just fuck me.

3
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:36,261
Maybe we should wait.

4
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:39,164
Wait for what?

5
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,734
The next time
we see each other.

6
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:44,903
What?

7
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:47,072
Oh, now--

8
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:49,942
now I just feel like,
um-- like a whore.

9
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,278
That's no good.

10
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,115
Is this your go-to move
or something?

11
00:01:56,117 --> 00:02:01,553
You just hook me in
and make me believe
that you're this gentleman.

12
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:04,189
I never said
i was a gentleman.

13
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:08,060
But I'm not playing games.

14
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:10,829
Well, sometimes
games can be fun.

15
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:16,869
Okay.

16
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:19,238
Let's do it.
Let's fuck.

17
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,306
No, it's too late.

18
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,075
It's too late.

19
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:26,512
I think--
i think you're right.

20
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:28,347
Let's wait.
It's a great idea.

21
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:29,715
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.

22
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:43,595
Maybe you could hold me down
while you do it.

23
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,405
Tighter.
Tighter?

24
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,309
<i> Jefe.</i>
Yeah.

25
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:32,511
Luis just finished
cleaning up.

26
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,713
What, you got a party
to go to?<i> ¿fiesta?</i>

27
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,215
<i> Sí.</i>

28
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:11,950
-Good night, frank.
-Good night, sweetheart.

29
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,788
I'm going
to the tiki bar later
if you wanna come.

30
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,191
Yeah. Maybe.
I'll let you know.

31
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,041
Ah,<i> merci.</i>

32
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,715
Happy Halloween.

33
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:02,334
Voilà.

34
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,711
Oh, my god.

35
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,781
Is that caviar?

36
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:18,050
Osetra.
From the black sea.

37
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:22,087
What else is in this?
This is...

38
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,157
Fucking incredible.

39
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:27,826
Crème fraîche.
French butter.

40
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,762
Sea salt. Chives.
Brioche bread.

41
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,846
<i>Actually, the name</i>
<i>of your place, rue galilée--</i>

42
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,048
<i>I lived on that block once.</i>

43
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,584
<i> Me too.</i>

44
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,320
<i> No shit.</i>

45
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:58,190
<i>It's where I learned</i>
<i>to cook when I was a kid.</i>

46
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,492
<i>Dropped out of high school.</i>

47
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:04,496
<i>Bought a plane ticket</i>
<i>with the money I saved up</i>
<i>baking pizzas in queens</i>

48
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:06,431
and flew to France.

49
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,638
What?

50
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,743
You're pretty cool,
frank.

51
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:20,038
Oh, I just love this Tequila.
It does wonders
for the nerves.

52
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,339
Mm-hmm.

53
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,945
Okay.

54
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,314
Lick.

55
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,483
Mmm!

56
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:36,221
This restaurant
is exquisite, frank.

57
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,560
And you are a doll
for arranging the reservation.

58
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:45,330
I was the sous chef
here for five years,
so they take care of me.

59
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:47,232
You still
haven't told me
why you're here.

60
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,802
Tina Turner
has a house in nice,

61
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,506
and<i> architectural digest</i>
is sending me to write about it.
Oh, wow.

62
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:56,441
I love
the south of France.

63
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:59,678
Tina has
a one-night-only show tonight,

64
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,713
so I'm getting a ride
on her jet tomorrow.

65
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,751
After Tina,
I'm off to Paris for some fun.

66
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,587
Where are you staying?

67
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,388
At Alan's spare flat.

68
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,091
Oh.

69
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,393
He sends his regards,
by the way.

70
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,231
Tell him
that I say hello.

71
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:26,705
So, Lola tells me that
you're classically trained.

72
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:30,375
I mean, I learned
on the job in France,
which I guess would qualify.

73
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:33,445
I didn't go to cooking school.
I started young.

74
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:36,181
-How young?
-Sixteen.

75
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,717
Mmm. Quite an image.

76
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,653
I can't wait
to taste your food.

77
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:44,623
It would be my pleasure.

78
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,526
Perhaps I can bring Wayne
before I leave tomorrow.

79
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,160
Wayne?
Newton.

80
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,062
Seriously?

81
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:53,398
He's absolutely lovely.

82
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,002
-Would you like to meet him?
-Yeah. I'll be there. Thanks.

83
00:08:57,004 --> 00:09:01,006
-But I'll be
at school all day.
-Not my fault, Lola.

84
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:02,841
You don't need
to be there.

85
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:04,242
Mother.

86
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:05,810
What?

87
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:08,113
Stop being
patronizing.

88
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:10,949
Frank.

89
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,052
Was I being patronizing?

90
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,489
Yeah, you were.

91
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,626
But that's all right.

92
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,008
You okay?

93
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:44,349
What you did with my mom--
calling her out.

94
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,954
You really
looked out for me.
I'm not used to it.

95
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,490
Well, get used to it.

96
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,033
Good night, Lola.

97
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,176
Do you fall in love
easily, frank?

98
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,112
No. Do you?

99
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:23,455
I just don't think
I'm gonna be any good at this.

100
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,158
You know,

101
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,127
I've been married.

102
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:35,900
I'm sure she was the one,
even though I really
barely knew her.

103
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,537
And I dove right in.

104
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,942
Do it.

105
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,289
All I'm saying is

106
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:01,393
the way you're feeling
right now, this fear--

107
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,430
I'm with you.

108
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:19,504
She's coming? For real?

109
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:22,340
Your mother?
That's cool.
All right.

110
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:23,875
Well, listen.
I-- I, uh--

111
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:27,011
I know how to navigate
those waters.

112
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:29,581
So listen.
How about this?

113
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:32,517
How about
i take you both out?
You and your mother.

114
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,354
Right? 'Cause it's not every day
a girl graduates from college.
That's a big deal.

115
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:39,224
Well, I graduated
last month.
All right.

116
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:41,626
And she's doesn't like
insurance salesmen.

117
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:44,062
Wow. Whoa. Really?

118
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:47,132
Yeah, I don't
sell insurance, so...

119
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:49,701
Well, she's doesn't like men
who look like David schwimmer.

120
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:52,237
David schwimmer?
I am David schwimmer.

121
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:55,039
I'm just kidding.

122
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:58,743
So, you find a job yet?
'Cause that's tough, right?
Right out of college.

123
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:02,313
Well, there's not
much of a market for aspiring
fashion designers in Vegas

124
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:05,416
who don't make stripper heels
or thongs, so no.

125
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:07,886
You are mad funny.
Stripper heels.

126
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:10,088
I don't know though.
I wouldn't be so sure.

127
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,623
Oh, yeah?

128
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,159
There's a place
next door-- kvd.
You ever heard of it?

129
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:18,463
Yeah. There's one downtown.
Yeah. It's cool.
So check this out.

130
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:21,466
The owner's been
making a real effort
to showcase Vegas-based talent.

131
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:25,003
And so he set up
this fashion Incubator
to help him out with that.

132
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:28,173
If I come back
with you tonight and you see
where the night takes us,

133
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:31,609
then maybe you'll
introduce me to the owner.
No, but I will set you up

134
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:34,512
with the person
who decides who's gonna be
the designer for the Incubator.

135
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:38,116
-You know her?
-Do I know her? Yeah.
She works for me.

136
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:39,751
I'm the owner.

137
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:41,152
Oh.

138
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,954
Is your work
any good?

139
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:46,424
Yeah. Yeah. I, uh--
i just had my show,

140
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:48,459
my thesis show.
Oh, for real?

141
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:51,362
All right, well, yeah,
I'll set up
a studio visit.

142
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:54,966
You're not kidding.
No. I don't care
about that stuff, no.

143
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:57,669
Why are you
offering me this?

144
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,205
Maybe because
you're being mean to me,
and I like it.

145
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:01,673
Aha.
I like
a little sass.

146
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,308
And it's not
an offer, okay?

147
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,211
It's just an interview.
And I should make it clear

148
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:08,813
that I don't sleep
with anyone
who works for me.

149
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:11,783
I learned that lesson
the hard way.
There you go.

150
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:14,886
Keith winkleman.
That's right.

151
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:17,555
If you're interested,
call me on Monday,
all right?

152
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,324
If I'm interested,
then I will.

153
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:20,758
All right.

154
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:30,168
Hi, sweetie.

155
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,504
You're with Patricia?
No, she's still
up in her room.

156
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:35,573
I've been here
for over an hour.

157
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:37,642
Are you close by?
Yeah. Turn to your left.

158
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,046
Hello, handsome man.

159
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:46,551
-Who was the mook?
-The mook?

160
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,720
Yeah, that tool
that was trying to fuck you.

161
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,924
Come on.
He was harmless.

162
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:55,293
Ah, I guess it's fine.

163
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,498
You okay?

164
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,700
Well, they closed the deal.

165
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:06,604
So new owners, new chef,
new everything.

166
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:08,072
It's done.

167
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,674
I'm sorry.

168
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:10,942
Yeah.

169
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:12,877
You knew it was coming.

170
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,380
I'll be fine.

171
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,849
Yeah. Of course you will.

172
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:20,485
We're gonna miss
our reservation.

173
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,689
I'm gonna try shaming her
out of her room.

174
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:28,826
Hey.

175
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,765
You look beautiful.

176
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:56,587
Is it too late to make
an adjustment to the menu?

177
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:59,057
I was thinking
salmon might be
a nice second option.

178
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:01,059
Dinner's in two hours.

179
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:02,627
Yes.

180
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,996
That's not gonna happen.

181
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:08,066
Maybe we could just add
a second entrée option then.

182
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:10,335
Without meat.

183
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:12,370
No problem.

184
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,016
Yeah.

185
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:26,851
Okay, amazing.

186
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:29,387
I can't wait.
I'm really excited.

187
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:34,125
Do you wanna get
a drink afterwards?

188
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:36,627
I will try not
to be a fuck-up.

189
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,363
Okay.

190
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:40,832
You too. Bye.

191
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,801
Hey.
Hey.

192
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:45,336
Who was that?

193
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,171
My new boss.

194
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,007
What?

195
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,708
No, I got a job.

196
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,811
Wow. All right.
With who?

197
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:55,646
It's working
with this fashion Incubator,

198
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:58,750
and they just pay
young designers to come up
with clothes for their store.

199
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,186
Congratulations.

200
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,122
Thank you very much.

201
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:10,561
You're not working
for that douche bag, huh?

202
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:12,630
No. For this woman.

203
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,665
But it's
where he works, right?

204
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,200
He doesn't
work there.

205
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:19,470
He just owns the company.

206
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:22,507
Why didn't you tell me
you were up for it?
That's a little weird.

207
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:25,643
Because I thought
you'd be mad, which you are.

208
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,712
I'm not mad.
I just don't like that guy.

209
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,114
Why? He's been
very professional.

210
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,552
How was the banquet?

211
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,188
Little old rich ladies
who lunch.

212
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,357
They're killing me.
They booked me again.

213
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,859
That's-- that's
really good.
That's great.

214
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,695
It's catering.
Cooking for private parties
isn't catering.

215
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:46,431
You're working
almost every day.

216
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:50,101
But nobody knows
how to eat anymore. They
all want gluten-free salads.

217
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,506
I might as well
open a salad shop
and call it salad guy.

218
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:56,841
Exactly.

219
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,578
Hey.

220
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,247
Do me a favor.

221
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,950
Tell this, uh,
boss of yours--
what's his name?

222
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:08,953
He's not my boss.
Keith.
Keith.

223
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:11,055
Tell him
you're in love with a man

224
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:13,858
who owns an extremely
sharp set of knives.

225
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,962
I guess
we should celebrate.

226
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,308
Hey, gorgeous.
Hi.

227
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:08,679
Hey, uh,
will's picking us up
at 7:00, all right?

228
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:12,884
-He wants to be on the road
to la right after rush hour.
-I'll be on time. I promise.

229
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,555
Hey.

230
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,560
I love you.

231
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:26,264
Me too.

232
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,805
All right.
I got to go.
Okay. I'll see you at 9:00.

233
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:37,575
-What?
-I'm just kidding, dorko.
I'll see you at 7:00.

234
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:41,679
Dorko.

235
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:14,145
<i> This is Lola.</i>
<i> Leave a message.</i>

236
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,151
You know what?
You guys should just go.

237
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:22,553
Stop. We will wait.
No, I got this.

238
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,155
It's okay. Go ahead.

239
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:28,326
If something's up,
we'll stick around.

240
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:45,910
Seriously,
you guys go ahead.
It's okay.

241
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,645
Are you sure?
-Yeah.

242
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:51,015
Hey.

243
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:52,483
Where were you?

244
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,491
Baby, you okay?

245
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:04,762
Um, I was--

246
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,364
what? What happened?

247
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,002
I-- I think
we should go inside.

248
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,041
Okay.

249
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,412
You need a, uh--

250
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:22,680
you want one?

251
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,049
Uh, no.

252
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,120
Honey, listen to me.

253
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:31,622
I know-- I know
you're upset, and--

254
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:34,392
do you want to have a seat?

255
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:37,561
I just wanna know you're okay.
I just wanna know what happened.
That's all.

256
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:38,796
Please?

257
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,465
Can you please have a seat?

258
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:46,037
Okay. All right. Here.

259
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:55,179
I-- I think that...

260
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:57,715
I made a mistake.

261
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,119
What kind of mistake?

262
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:04,588
Um--

263
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,841
hello.

264
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,177
<i> Hi. I'm looking</i>
<i> for the owner of this phone.</i>

265
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,945
One second.

266
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:32,450
I'm with her right now.

267
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:34,552
I'm sure
she'll be relieved.

268
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:36,987
<i> -May I speak with her?</i>
-By all means.

269
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:38,723
Who is it?

270
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:41,292
You.

271
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,866
Hello.

272
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,635
<i>I'm calling</i>
<i>from the concierge desk</i>
<i>at the hotel.</i>

273
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:54,405
<i>A guest said his girlfriend</i>
<i>left her phone in his suite.</i>

274
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:56,273
<i>Is that you?</i>

275
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,910
Yes.
<i>This number keeps popping up</i>

276
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:01,512
<i>as a missed call.</i>

277
00:23:01,514 --> 00:23:04,548
<i>Hope your friend</i>
<i>doesn't mind we reached out.</i>

278
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,684
No, it's fine.

279
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:09,987
<i>And just for security purposes,</i>
<i>what hotel were you visiting?</i>

280
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:15,326
I was at the encore.
<i>That's us.</i>

281
00:23:15,328 --> 00:23:17,895
<i>You can pick it up</i>
<i>at the concierge any time.</i>

282
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,563
<i>Have a lovely evening.</i>

283
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:26,203
The encore used to be
the desert inn.

284
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:27,605
Did you know that?

285
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:28,806
No.

286
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,176
Well, that was a little
before your time.

287
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:38,115
I was a saucier there
for five years
at the best restaurant.

288
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:42,186
Sometimes after work,
a rich woman would take me
up to her room, and...

289
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:47,258
The older ones,
they taught me
how to fuck.

290
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,226
Oh, yeah.
So I liked that hotel.

291
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:50,528
Stop.

292
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,963
"Stop"?

293
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:57,802
I'm just letting you know
that I have fucked
some very beautiful women.

294
00:23:57,804 --> 00:24:02,606
Good ones. They don't worry
their mommy is gonna steal me
away from 'em.

295
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,877
Two hours ago,
i would've crawled
through glass for you.

296
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:10,181
And while
i was worried sick,
you were--

297
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,385
we're done.

298
00:24:14,387 --> 00:24:15,786
No, frank.

299
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:18,222
You were only with me
'cause you can't be alone.

300
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:20,958
Right?
I was alone
when I met you.

301
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,727
Oh, yeah?
For what, 24 hours?
No.

302
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:26,063
Of course not.

303
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:29,867
So you wait till we're together
to start fucking dudes
in fancy hotel rooms.

304
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:32,636
Good plan.

305
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:35,339
Who was it?

306
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:38,809
It was-- it was no one.

307
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,211
It was--

308
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:47,618
-who was it?
-It was a guy
from California.

309
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,987
And he's already
left town.

310
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,323
You know, it was awful.
It was nothing.

311
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:54,291
It meant nothing.

312
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:57,094
I get it.

313
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:59,597
This is what you do, right?
I could be anyone.

314
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:00,865
It's not true.

315
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,668
You are incredible.

316
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,937
You're a real man.

317
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,673
Oh, my god.

318
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,709
Thank you.

319
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:14,345
A real man would walk
the fuck out of here.

320
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:19,583
No. Please.
I'm not gonna let you go
without a fight.

321
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,603
Ow!

322
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:44,074
Ow! Stop it.

323
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,910
You're hurting me.

324
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,282
Look at me.

325
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,786
Don't stare
at anyone.

326
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,826
Don't fucking walk
away from me.

327
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:05,029
Look at me when
I'm talking to you.
Ow!

328
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:07,231
What the fuck--

329
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,172
frank Riley?

330
00:26:57,582 --> 00:27:01,251
Do you remember
when we had dinner
with my mother?

331
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:03,721
She said she was staying
with someone in Paris
called Alan.

332
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:08,459
Kind of. Why?

333
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:11,161
He's an old boyfriend
of hers.

334
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:14,999
And we lived with him
in Paris for a few years
when I was a kid.

335
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:17,568
And?

336
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:21,872
He raped me.

337
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:32,249
When was this?

338
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:34,518
Over the summer.

339
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,553
Before I came here.

340
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:41,025
I--

341
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:42,559
I'm sorry.

342
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,230
I thought I'd tell you.

343
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,100
No one else knows.

344
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,775
You didn't tell your mother?

345
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:02,846
I was afraid that she
wouldn't believe me.

346
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,994
You said his name is Alan?

347
00:28:16,996 --> 00:28:18,328
Yeah.

348
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,197
What's his story?

349
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:23,267
Why?
Just tell me.

350
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:32,009
He comes from
a rich Swedish family
who lost all their money.

351
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:34,545
He moved to France
to start over from nothing.

352
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:39,283
Then he wrote
a book about it.

353
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,219
It was a hit.

354
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:46,824
He left my mom.

355
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:50,060
Found a rich wife.

356
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:53,397
She lets him do what he wants.

357
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:56,500
It's very, you know, French.

358
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:10,314
I'm not making an excuse
for what I did.

359
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:18,555
It's just what happened
had an effect on me

360
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:21,191
that I can't understand.

361
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:27,965
But you think
you wouldn't have done
what you did yesterday

362
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:30,601
if you hadn't--

363
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,603
if you hadn't, uh--

364
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:35,405
I guess. I-- I don't know.

365
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:38,375
It definitely, like,
fucked me up though.

366
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:06,797
Frank?

367
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:10,367
May I borrow you
for a moment?

368
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:11,568
Yeah. Sure.

369
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:23,013
This guys walks out,
and she gets so-- boils over,
and she follows him...

370
00:31:23,015 --> 00:31:25,649
Every one,
this is frank Riley,

371
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:28,652
our chef.

372
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,989
I should get back.

373
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:34,224
Of course.

374
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:38,095
This is blah, blah, blah
from, you know-- from France
or whatever,

375
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:40,731
from some foreign country.
Excuse me.

376
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:44,635
Maybe she likes cheese.

377
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,539
Hey, hey,
lolita!

378
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:50,707
Hi.

379
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:52,976
Hello.

380
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:56,513
I should have known
that was your food.

381
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,952
You didn't get
my text?
No.

382
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:06,957
What are you doing here?

383
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:09,960
This is Keith's
partner's house.
You didn't know?

384
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:12,462
No. So, are you
that fucker's date?

385
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:14,798
Don't be ridiculous.

386
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,200
Oh, my god.
There he is.

387
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:19,970
Bro, you fucking
crushed it.

388
00:32:19,972 --> 00:32:23,273
That was phenomenal.
Believe me,
i know about good food.

389
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:26,543
My dad owns fine-dining
restaurants in la,
so I grew up around it.

390
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:28,779
And that was one
of the best I've ever had.

391
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:31,281
Seriously. Incredible.

392
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,050
Glad you enjoyed it.

393
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:34,685
Keith winkleman.

394
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:38,956
Nice to meet you.

395
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:42,059
I'm sorry.
Was I interrupting something?
You guys know each other?

396
00:32:42,061 --> 00:32:44,394
This is
my boyfriend,
frank Riley.

397
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:47,130
Frank, Keith.
Shut up.
You're kidding me.

398
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:50,467
You have a boyfriend,
and he cooks like this?
Are you kidding me?

399
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:53,170
Why didn't you tell me
about this guy?
This dude's amazing.

400
00:32:53,172 --> 00:32:56,239
Frank,
what are you doing here?
Excuse me?

401
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:58,008
You need
your own restaurant.

402
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,277
Yeah. That'd be cool.

403
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:02,946
Yeah, it would.
That's an understatement.

404
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:04,848
Mm-hmm.
Frank had
his own place.

405
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,050
He's just
in between restaurants
at the moment.

406
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:11,655
All right. Not for long,
'cause I'm gonna check around.

407
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:14,925
You know how Vegas is.
These huge casino joints
keep opening and closing.

408
00:33:14,927 --> 00:33:16,960
You really got
to stay on top of it.

409
00:33:16,962 --> 00:33:18,729
I'll just get
your information
from Lola, and...

410
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:22,933
I'll-I'll look around.

411
00:33:22,935 --> 00:33:24,935
Thanks, Keith.
That'd be great.
Yeah.

412
00:33:24,937 --> 00:33:28,372
I'm gonna head back in, Lola.
So I'll see you in there?

413
00:33:28,374 --> 00:33:31,041
-Cool. I'll see you in there.
-All right, for sure. Uh...

414
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:39,483
Well, that was
pretty funny.

415
00:33:39,485 --> 00:33:41,318
Yeah, it's
fucking hilarious,

416
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,887
especially
the part where he said
he didn't know I existed.

417
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:47,090
He never asked me
about my personal life,
so I didn't tell him.

418
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,861
I kind of owned
his ass, huh?

419
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:53,997
Yep.

420
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:57,868
So now he'll really
try to fuck you. Ow!

421
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,202
Shit!

422
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:22,426
Hey, baby.

423
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:24,561
Yo, frank. It's Keith.

424
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,264
Who?

425
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:29,900
Winkleman.

426
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:32,202
<i> Your lovely lady's</i>
<i> sitting right next to me.</i>

427
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:34,237
<i> You good?</i>

428
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,440
Yeah. Where are you?

429
00:34:36,442 --> 00:34:39,376
I'm with your girl.
We're at the space.
You got a sec?

430
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:41,912
<i> You ever heard</i>
<i> of Henri ricard?</i>

431
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:44,414
Of course.

432
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,783
Dude's got
more three-star
michelin restaurants

433
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:49,753
<i> than anyone</i>
<i> in the world.</i>
Was that a question?

434
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:52,456
Now, listen. My dad
financed Chloe, right?

435
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:54,925
Ricard's spot
in Santa Monica.
You ever heard of it?

436
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:56,593
<i> Yeah. Yeah,</i>
<i> I've been there.</i>

437
00:34:56,595 --> 00:35:00,297
We're all friends,
and now he's opened up
a new spot at the encore.

438
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:04,434
<i> It's a big fucking deal.</i>
<i> Auditions were in Paris</i>
<i> two weeks ago.</i>

439
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:08,105
Yeah, cool. I get it.
You're connected.
<i> Well, listen, my man.</i>

440
00:35:08,107 --> 00:35:10,974
He doesn't wanna bring
a celebrity chef to Vegas.
It's been done.

441
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,443
People are over it.
Gordon ramsay, all these people.
Blah, blah, blah.

442
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,779
He wants to launch
a new star right here.

443
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:18,615
<i> But he doesn't like</i>
<i> any of the chefs</i>
<i> that he auditioned.</i>

444
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:22,886
Frank, I got you in.

445
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:25,088
His mansion. In Paris.
This Friday.

446
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:28,658
Boom. It's gonna be
a mystery basket, so you got to
improvise. I hope that's okay.

447
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,794
Wait a minute.

448
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:32,662
You-- you what?

449
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:35,966
Yeah. You're cooking
for Henri fucking ricard
in three fucking days.

450
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:40,103
<i>I took care of the flights,</i>
<i>the tickets. My commission's</i>
<i>gonna come out of ricard's take.</i>

451
00:35:40,105 --> 00:35:43,173
<i>All you do is show up</i>
<i>and cook the meal of your life.</i>

452
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:44,841
Are you fucking with me?

453
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:47,177
He says,
"are you fucking with me?"

454
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:50,447
No, my man, I'm not.
What do you think?

455
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:55,819
It's amazing.
I don't know what to say.
<i> Yes.</i>

456
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:59,656
Hey, listen-- listen, man.
Thank me when it's all done.
I got a good feeling about this.

457
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,424
All right.

458
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:29,486
<i> You're gonna</i>
<i>kill it out there,</i>
<i>one-handed or not.</i>

459
00:36:29,488 --> 00:36:31,121
Yeah.

460
00:36:31,123 --> 00:36:33,423
I know it.
It's not that.

461
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,093
Then what is it?

462
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,431
Is it me?

463
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:46,203
I just wish
i could go back in time

464
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:49,039
and protect you
from that fucking scumbag.

465
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,642
Then we'd be fine.
I know it.

466
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:58,615
It's me.

467
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:06,957
I love you.

468
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:10,060
Don't forget that.

469
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:15,599
Good luck.

470
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:27,804
<i> This is Lola.</i>
<i> Leave a message.</i>

471
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:30,006
Hey, it's me.

472
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:34,544
I'm going into this thing,
so, uh, I just wanted
to call and say hey.

473
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:39,449
Anyway, call me.

474
00:38:39,451 --> 00:38:41,051
I love you.

475
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,867
Mr. Riley?
Mm-hmm.

476
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:00,670
I'm Charles,
Mr. ricard's attaché.

477
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:01,871
<i> Bonjour.</i>

478
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:03,873
The house is just
across the Plaza.

479
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:04,774
Let's walk.
Okay.

480
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:14,617
<i> All of the ingredients</i>
<i>are in the kitchen.</i>

481
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,820
Anything in the pantry
is yours.

482
00:39:16,822 --> 00:39:20,457
We have one sous chef for you.
He speaks English,
but French is preferable.

483
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:21,891
Okay.

484
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:23,793
There'll be
two people eating.

485
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:35,372
Hello, chef.
I'm Khalil.

486
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:37,006
<i> Bonjour.</i>
Nice to meet you.

487
00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:39,109
Um, the basket.

488
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,414
All right, all right,
all right.

489
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:55,125
I got this, man. I got this.

490
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,962
<i> -Merci.</i>
-Okay.<i> Bon courage.</i>

491
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:09,005
Truffle?
<i> Oui.</i>

492
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:10,907
Smell it.

493
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:15,011
Great.

494
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:16,646
Right?
Yeah.

495
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:24,454
Okay, chef.

496
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:28,885
<i> Oui.</i>

497
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,188
You know where you are, right?

498
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:34,891
<i> Oui.</i>

499
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,194
<i> Bon appétit.</i>

500
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:49,439
You used truffle, yes?
Yes.

501
00:41:49,441 --> 00:41:53,042
That was not
the agreement.
Yeah, I know.

502
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:57,714
Okay, I have an appointment.
You can show yourself out.
Thank you for your time.

503
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:00,870
<i> Bonsoir.</i>

504
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:06,509
Okay. Come on, playboy.
Try a Martini.

505
00:44:06,511 --> 00:44:09,979
Your aim
is getting better.
I practice.

506
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:13,983
Yeah, practice your Martini,
American style.
Much more important.

507
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:15,551
American style?

508
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:19,389
We like 'em dry in America.

509
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:21,591
Right.

510
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:37,073
Whiskey,<i> s'il vous plaît.</i>

511
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:42,078
How's it going?

512
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:45,448
New York?

513
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:47,717
Brooklyn?

514
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:50,553
It's queens, right?
Queens, yeah?

515
00:44:50,555 --> 00:44:52,588
How can you tell?

516
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:55,425
Alan.

517
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:57,427
Keith.

518
00:44:58,395 --> 00:44:59,696
I'm sorry.

519
00:44:59,698 --> 00:45:01,597
So what brings you
to Paris?

520
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:05,635
I was on vacation
with my girlfriend.

521
00:45:05,637 --> 00:45:08,337
She left. I stayed.
Oh.

522
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:11,474
Well, you don't seem
too broken up about it.

523
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:13,609
Hmm. These things happen,
i guess.

524
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:16,479
Yeah, I guess you're right.

525
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:27,657
<i> -Très bien.</i>
<i> -Merci, beaucoup.</i>

526
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,828
Alan, right?

527
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,429
Yeah.

528
00:45:33,431 --> 00:45:36,232
You know,
you look so familiar.
I'm trying to place it.

529
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,868
I-i know I've seen
your face before.

530
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:41,170
No, I doubt that.

531
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:43,573
I got it.

532
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:46,042
You're Alan Larsson, right?

533
00:45:46,044 --> 00:45:48,177
Yeah. Have we met?

534
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:50,813
No, I've seen your picture
on the back of your book.
Your memoir.

535
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:55,852
I studied it in college
in Northwestern.

536
00:45:55,854 --> 00:45:59,555
Really--
really fucking brainy stuff.

537
00:45:59,557 --> 00:46:01,524
Seriously.

538
00:46:01,526 --> 00:46:03,025
Am I right?

539
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:11,200
Yeah. Oh, thanks
for your kind words.

540
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:14,604
You know,
I'd like to buy you a drink
if you don't mind.

541
00:46:14,606 --> 00:46:17,573
Wait, don't be silly.
You're the one
with the heavy heart.

542
00:46:17,575 --> 00:46:21,043
It's not every day
you run into a fan,
so cheers to that.

543
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:23,679
Cheers.

544
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:29,719
So, um,
if you're up to it,

545
00:46:29,721 --> 00:46:32,021
I can show you around
in Paris.

546
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:38,561
You know what?
Why the hell not?

547
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,311
So let's grab one more
and then have some fun.

548
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,047
Sounds good.

549
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,922
Make yourself comfortable.

550
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:22,538
So you live here alone?

551
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,142
Well, occasionally.

552
00:47:26,144 --> 00:47:27,877
I'm married.

553
00:47:27,879 --> 00:47:31,347
So I have this
for when I need it,

554
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,916
if you catch my drift.

555
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:38,087
Your wife doesn't mind?
There are rules.

556
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:41,824
Certain behavior's
permitted.

557
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:44,293
Certain behavior's not.

558
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:45,261
Cheers.

559
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:50,900
With other girls, right?

560
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:56,472
They have to
remain strangers.

561
00:47:56,474 --> 00:47:58,241
But my wife has
the same privileges.

562
00:47:58,243 --> 00:48:00,142
Just only lovers,
no feelings.

563
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:03,646
You always play by the rules?

564
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:08,317
You have a lot of questions,
you know that?

565
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,760
Oh, excuse me.

566
00:48:17,762 --> 00:48:20,196
Mm. No problem.

567
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:21,631
Hello?

568
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:41,484
Excuse me.

569
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:47,423
So, you read my book
at the Northwestern, right?

570
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,525
Mm. Yeah.

571
00:48:49,527 --> 00:48:51,861
Yeah, that makes sense.

572
00:48:51,863 --> 00:48:54,096
I was an adjunct professor there
for a couple of years.

573
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,868
So where'd you live?

574
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:01,771
Off campus.

575
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:04,540
Let me guess. Marty summers
taught you my book.

576
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,876
Oh, yeah.

577
00:49:06,878 --> 00:49:09,412
Yeah, Marty summers.
He's a great guy.

578
00:49:09,414 --> 00:49:11,013
Yes. Great.

579
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:19,789
You never went
to Northwestern,
did you, Keith?

580
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,259
Why would you ask that?

581
00:49:23,261 --> 00:49:27,463
What are the chances that
an American knowing my book
so well?

582
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:31,934
And then just runs
into me here in Paris
at my local bistro.

583
00:49:31,936 --> 00:49:34,804
Marty summers is
my American accountant.

584
00:49:34,806 --> 00:49:36,072
He's not a teacher.

585
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:43,813
Okay.

586
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:49,618
What do you want?
What have I done to you?

587
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:54,590
You don't just rape a girl
and get away with it.

588
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:58,761
I never raped anyone
in my whole life.

589
00:49:58,763 --> 00:50:01,163
Now, who told you that?

590
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:04,100
It doesn't matter.
Of course it matters.
It matters for me.

591
00:50:04,102 --> 00:50:06,502
You have to give me
a chance to defend myself.

592
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:13,275
Queens, is that where you live?

593
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:16,645
Hmm.

594
00:50:16,647 --> 00:50:18,781
So let me guess.

595
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,517
It's las Vegas, right?

596
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:27,990
I'm starting to know
what this is all about.

597
00:50:30,128 --> 00:50:32,261
Come on.
Hey, hey.

598
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,558
<i> Play with her.</i>

599
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,660
<i> Ask me nicely, Alan.</i>

600
00:51:04,662 --> 00:51:06,662
<i> No. I'm not</i>
<i> gonna ask you nicely.</i>

601
00:51:06,664 --> 00:51:08,164
<i> Play with her. Do it.</i>

602
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:12,802
<i> Fine.</i>

603
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:18,941
<i> Keep going.</i>

604
00:51:18,943 --> 00:51:21,177
<i> Now look at me.</i>
<i> Both-- both of you.</i>

605
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:23,345
<i> I think I know</i>
<i> what you want.</i>

606
00:51:23,347 --> 00:51:25,581
<i> No, you don't.</i>
<i> Yeah, I do.</i>

607
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:28,017
<i> No, you don't.</i>

608
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:30,820
Put it back on.
Could you please
put down your knife?

609
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:35,124
Put it back on.

610
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:42,731
<i>You want us...</i>
<i>To get rough?</i>

611
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:45,734
<i>You wanna see it</i>
<i>really fucking rough?</i>

612
00:51:45,736 --> 00:51:50,139
<i>You wanna be a part of it,</i>
<i>but it's just the two of us</i>
<i>and I'd be left out.</i>

613
00:51:50,141 --> 00:51:52,274
<i>No, I'm not getting left out.</i>

614
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:53,509
<i>Don't lie.</i>

615
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:57,646
<i> You want us to love it</i>
<i> so much, and we will.</i>

616
00:51:57,648 --> 00:51:59,648
<i>We're gonna fucking love it.</i>

617
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:03,219
<i> Want me to give it</i>
<i>to you rough?</i>
<i>I want you to give it to me.</i>

618
00:52:03,221 --> 00:52:04,220
<i> Come here.</i>

619
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:07,923
<i>Come here, come here,</i>
<i>come here.</i>

620
00:52:07,925 --> 00:52:09,358
<i>Come here.</i>

621
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:36,385
You asked me before
if I ever broke the rules.

622
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:39,221
I did once, with her.

623
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:44,026
So it was serious, huh?

624
00:52:44,028 --> 00:52:47,129
I mean, you, uh--

625
00:52:47,131 --> 00:52:48,330
it was real.

626
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:51,233
Yeah. Quite real.

627
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:58,874
And I'm dreadfully sorry
that you had to see the tape.

628
00:52:58,876 --> 00:53:02,545
No man should be
exposed to that.

629
00:53:02,547 --> 00:53:05,381
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
I had no idea.

630
00:53:05,383 --> 00:53:08,684
She can be very convincing.

631
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:13,088
Are you two still together?

632
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:19,929
Who was the other girl?
We met her at a club.

633
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:25,901
I was actually planning
dropping by there tonight.

634
00:53:25,903 --> 00:53:28,437
Maybe you want to come along?

635
00:53:36,347 --> 00:53:37,813
Hello.
Come on.

636
00:53:37,815 --> 00:53:39,448
Enjoy.
Yeah.

637
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:31,934
So I have
an early appointment.

638
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:33,936
You'll be all right
by yourself?

639
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:36,438
Yeah, man, I'm fine.

640
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,009
I'm coming to las Vegas
in a while for business.

641
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:44,647
Here's my card.
I stay at the encore hotel.

642
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:52,655
Hey, Alan.

643
00:54:52,657 --> 00:54:54,690
What?

644
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:57,693
Thanks.

645
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,469
So what do you need?

646
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:43,605
A floor. A bed. Not this.

647
00:55:43,607 --> 00:55:47,643
And that's why you're here?

648
00:55:47,645 --> 00:55:51,046
To find someone and take her
somewhere more private?

649
00:55:53,216 --> 00:55:55,451
I haven't decided yet.

650
00:55:55,453 --> 00:55:57,619
Let me know if you do.

651
00:55:57,621 --> 00:56:00,022
I might be able to help.

652
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:28,437
The restaurant I am planning
is not small,

653
00:58:28,439 --> 00:58:31,306
and there will be
a lot of visibility.

654
00:58:31,308 --> 00:58:34,877
You are very impressive
in the kitchen,

655
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:39,681
but are you strong enough
for the pressure,
the responsibility

656
00:58:39,683 --> 00:58:42,251
of what will be
in front of you?

657
00:58:49,325 --> 00:58:50,592
<i> Oui.</i>

658
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:09,678
Does the ride
that just dropped you off
mean what I think it means?

659
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:13,048
What?
I was watching
from the balcony.

660
00:59:14,183 --> 00:59:16,351
Yeah. I got it.

661
00:59:16,353 --> 00:59:18,654
Yes!
Mm-hmm.

662
00:59:18,656 --> 00:59:20,789
I knew that you would.

663
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:33,468
You hungry?

664
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:38,307
Yeah, sure.

665
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:42,411
Good. 'Cause
I'm taking you out.

666
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:45,147
Mm-hmm.

667
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,958
You saw him.

668
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,359
In Paris.

669
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,632
What did he tell you?

670
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,705
Come on. Let's eat later.

671
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:13,909
Mmm.

672
01:00:13,911 --> 01:00:16,511
Do you have any idea...

673
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:23,719
<i> What it's like to watch</i>
<i> the woman you love...</i>

674
01:00:23,721 --> 01:00:26,021
Take orders
like a little whore...

675
01:00:31,762 --> 01:00:33,962
<i> Down on her hands</i>
<i> and knees...</i>

676
01:00:40,337 --> 01:00:42,337
Oh, what a beautiful cock.

677
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:54,049
He showed you the video.

678
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:57,085
He knew I was going
to hurt him.

679
01:00:58,588 --> 01:01:01,490
Because of what you said,
you know.

680
01:01:01,492 --> 01:01:04,226
He took me
to his favorite club.

681
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:09,698
Did you go home with anyone?

682
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,400
Some rich lady
and her friend.

683
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:15,904
So now I'm rotten.

684
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:20,242
So are you.

685
01:01:21,144 --> 01:01:23,045
So is this.

686
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:29,184
I'll come back
and get my shit tomorrow.

687
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:15,630
You said you'd be gone by 6:00.
It's nearly 7:00.

688
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:19,101
I just want to know
what happened.

689
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:22,704
The truth.

690
01:02:22,706 --> 01:02:24,473
You know?

691
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:28,343
Please.

692
01:02:28,345 --> 01:02:30,145
He played you.

693
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:33,014
You got played.

694
01:02:35,351 --> 01:02:36,818
What?

695
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:40,355
The woman who picked you up
in the club...

696
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:43,325
What did she look like?

697
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:46,261
What difference
does it make?

698
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:49,331
Did she live in the 7th,
in a mansion?

699
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,603
Yeah.
Yeah, it's Claire.
It's his wife.

700
01:02:54,605 --> 01:02:57,839
Getting her to misbehave
allows him to do
whatever he wants.

701
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:07,482
He's the one you fucked
in the hotel. Right?

702
01:03:07,484 --> 01:03:09,351
Yeah.

703
01:03:10,653 --> 01:03:12,687
Why?

704
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:18,026
Pour me a drink.

705
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,816
I went to Paris to study,

706
01:03:40,818 --> 01:03:45,921
and Alan
was the only person
that I knew.

707
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:50,325
He said that I could have
the place all to myself.

708
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:58,433
And I remember
my first night there.

709
01:03:58,435 --> 01:04:01,369
I was sitting in the kitchen,

710
01:04:01,371 --> 01:04:05,841
and I was looking out
the window over Paris,
and I thought,

711
01:04:05,843 --> 01:04:10,579
"wow. For the first time,
I'm not surrounded by chaos."

712
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:14,783
And then I went to bed.

713
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:21,456
And when I woke up,

714
01:04:21,458 --> 01:04:26,094
he had already tied
my hands and my feet to the bed.

715
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:38,573
It wasn't the rape--
and he did rape me--

716
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:41,309
that turned me into this--

717
01:04:41,311 --> 01:04:43,478
this crazy person.

718
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:50,118
What fucked me up
was that I didn't leave.

719
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,921
I stayed with him.

720
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:57,158
What fucked me up...

721
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:01,496
Was that I...
Fell in love with him.

722
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:07,135
I found out that I was pregnant.

723
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:11,306
And he just disappeared.

724
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:18,079
I f-freaked out
and started calling the house.

725
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:23,051
His wife said to me
that if I...

726
01:05:23,053 --> 01:05:24,753
Got an abortion...

727
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:31,326
If I left France immediately
she was going to write me
a check for $400,000.

728
01:05:37,466 --> 01:05:41,836
So I came here
a week later...

729
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,210
And that's when I met you.

730
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:55,116
And that morning,

731
01:05:55,118 --> 01:06:00,522
he called me,
and he was begging me
to let him apologize.

732
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:04,926
And I had--

733
01:06:04,928 --> 01:06:09,197
I had no intention
of fucking him.

734
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,367
And then i-- I think...

735
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:17,872
I just-- I think I shut down.

736
01:06:19,608 --> 01:06:21,543
I just let him do it.

737
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,548
And when it was over...

738
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:31,386
I started to panic...

739
01:06:33,522 --> 01:06:36,825
Because all I could
think about was you...

740
01:06:39,362 --> 01:06:41,563
And what
i just destroyed.

741
01:06:45,535 --> 01:06:46,768
Lola--

742
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:48,703
I didn't think...

743
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:51,573
You'd just take me back.

744
01:06:53,943 --> 01:06:55,577
But you did.

745
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:07,922
Baby, why didn't you
just tell me this before?

746
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:12,627
Why did you
track him down, frank?

747
01:07:16,732 --> 01:07:22,070
You said that
what we have is rotten.

748
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:24,372
And you're right.

749
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:25,807
No.

750
01:07:28,911 --> 01:07:31,513
I'm sorry. I'm so--

751
01:07:31,515 --> 01:07:33,348
I'm sorry.

752
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:34,783
I'm sorry.

753
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,988
I... I just think that it's--

754
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:41,756
it's time...

755
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:45,160
That we let each other go.

756
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:50,565
No.

757
01:07:50,567 --> 01:07:53,234
You can...
No.

758
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:58,673
You can leave your keys
on the table.

759
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,661
The new shit
comes Monday, right?

760
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:21,930
<i> Sí, jefe.</i>

761
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:25,633
You think you can handle
that delivery by yourself?

762
01:08:25,635 --> 01:08:28,269
Yeah. Yeah, no problem.

763
01:08:32,542 --> 01:08:34,809
Bonjour.
<i> Bonjour,</i> Charles.

764
01:08:34,811 --> 01:08:36,244
<i> How's everything?</i>

765
01:08:36,246 --> 01:08:39,214
Oh, yeah,
we're here now.
No, it's great.

766
01:08:39,216 --> 01:08:40,949
It's perfect.

767
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:46,788
Well, I wanted to come
to Paris and cook Henri
the complete menu.

768
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:48,289
<i> Yes, of course.</i>

769
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:50,558
Yeah.
<i> Très bien.</i>
<i> When?</i>

770
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,393
I was thinking
maybe next week.

771
01:08:52,395 --> 01:08:54,295
<i> Terrific.</i>

772
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:24,225
<i> Bravo, monsieur.</i>

773
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:57,125
If I knew we would be
talking about that
troublesome little girl,

774
01:09:57,127 --> 01:09:59,127
I would not have
invited you in.

775
01:09:59,129 --> 01:10:01,796
I understand.
I'm sorry, but...

776
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:06,267
I need to hear it from you.

777
01:10:07,236 --> 01:10:09,037
Because you don't trust her?

778
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:11,773
Because I need to know
that I can.

779
01:10:13,576 --> 01:10:16,644
And if I don't want
to discuss it?

780
01:10:16,646 --> 01:10:18,446
That's up to you.

781
01:10:23,586 --> 01:10:27,088
Yes, Alan got her pregnant.

782
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:28,356
And, yes, I gave her money
to go away.

783
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:35,730
You can let yourself out.
And, please, don't come back.

784
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:44,539
He came to see her,
you know.

785
01:10:44,541 --> 01:10:45,907
In Vegas.

786
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:47,275
When?
December.

787
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:51,713
December?
He was on business in Chicago.

788
01:10:51,715 --> 01:10:53,681
Oh, yeah?

789
01:10:53,683 --> 01:10:55,617
You sure about that?

790
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:59,487
Alan can be reckless,
but he's not a fool.

791
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:02,190
His heart is with me.

792
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:05,693
I was very clear
about what would happen

793
01:11:05,695 --> 01:11:07,562
if he made
another mistake with her.

794
01:11:07,564 --> 01:11:09,998
Why don't we
pay him a visit
and let him prove it?

795
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:13,534
Impossible.
He's traveling.

796
01:11:13,536 --> 01:11:15,436
Business trip?

797
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:17,705
Mm-hmm.

798
01:11:17,707 --> 01:11:18,973
Chicago?

799
01:11:18,975 --> 01:11:20,341
Right?

800
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:22,677
Uh-huh.

801
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:28,116
When did he leave?

802
01:11:28,118 --> 01:11:29,717
This morning.

803
01:13:42,785 --> 01:13:44,252
Lola.

804
01:13:45,454 --> 01:13:46,988
How's Vegas treating you?

805
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,334
I should have known
it would be you.

806
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:04,205
Aren't you supposed
to be in Chicago?

807
01:14:04,207 --> 01:14:07,809
As far as Claire
is concerned, I am.

808
01:14:07,811 --> 01:14:10,878
You have a very trusting wife.

809
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,814
I do indeed.

810
01:14:19,321 --> 01:14:23,090
-Keith--
-my name is frank, not Keith.

811
01:14:23,092 --> 01:14:24,859
This is my restaurant.

812
01:14:28,897 --> 01:14:30,398
Want a drink?

813
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:38,639
Yeah, why not?

814
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:45,580
Have a seat.

815
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:50,718
Or not.

816
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:57,592
Well, you're
very clever, Alan.

817
01:14:57,594 --> 01:14:59,527
You're always one step
ahead of me.

818
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:10,872
Oh, no knife this time.
You want to frisk me?

819
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:15,209
I should not have played
that tape. I'm sorry.

820
01:15:15,211 --> 01:15:17,912
Oh, you loved
showing me that tape.

821
01:15:18,981 --> 01:15:19,947
Come on.

822
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:25,186
So, uh,
why are you here, man?

823
01:15:25,188 --> 01:15:27,154
I know
you want to fuck her,

824
01:15:27,156 --> 01:15:29,023
but is it really
worth all the...

825
01:15:29,725 --> 01:15:31,926
Transatlantic travel?

826
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:35,530
I don't think you'd understand.

827
01:15:35,532 --> 01:15:37,698
Why's that?

828
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:42,703
Because you're a fucking monkey
who lies to himself
about what turns him on.

829
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:45,907
I'm not like that,
and neither is Lola.

830
01:15:49,411 --> 01:15:52,346
Lola needs to be left alone.

831
01:15:52,348 --> 01:15:55,049
She deserves that,
after what
we've put her through.

832
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:57,485
Right.

833
01:15:57,487 --> 01:16:00,555
You're going
to go back to Claire.

834
01:16:00,557 --> 01:16:02,490
You're going
to leave Lola alone.

835
01:16:02,492 --> 01:16:04,258
And you're going
to do it today.

836
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:06,961
And if I don't?

837
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:10,131
You will.

838
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:17,572
My wife is someone, a thing,
that I tolerate.

839
01:16:17,574 --> 01:16:19,340
Lola is my prize.

840
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:30,017
Your flight's in four hours.

841
01:16:30,019 --> 01:16:33,754
I'm sorry. That doesn't work.

842
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:37,992
Hey. You see all these?

843
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:42,563
They record sound too.

844
01:16:42,565 --> 01:16:44,565
Claire gave me
her e-mail address.

845
01:16:44,567 --> 01:16:47,535
She could be
watching all of this
in less than an hour.

846
01:16:47,537 --> 01:16:49,103
Right.

847
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:52,573
You're not
35 years old anymore.

848
01:16:52,575 --> 01:16:56,811
Getting a little long
in the tooth for this shit.
Don't you think?

849
01:16:56,813 --> 01:16:58,546
Something to think about.

850
01:16:58,548 --> 01:17:00,548
Right, yeah.

851
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:02,650
Just do yourself
a favor, pops.

852
01:17:02,652 --> 01:17:05,086
Get the fuck
out of here.
Yeah.

853
01:17:05,088 --> 01:17:07,054
Fuck!

854
01:17:08,056 --> 01:17:09,857
Ahh! Ah.

855
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:01,375
Oh, fuck.

856
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:05,146
Okay.

857
01:18:09,484 --> 01:18:11,619
You got your passport?

858
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:15,456
Huh?

859
01:18:15,458 --> 01:18:17,792
Your fucking passport.
Do you got it?

860
01:18:17,794 --> 01:18:19,460
Y-yeah.

861
01:18:19,462 --> 01:18:23,164
All right. I'm going
to drive you to the airport,

862
01:18:23,166 --> 01:18:25,466
and you're going
to fucking disappear.

863
01:18:28,303 --> 01:18:29,704
Am I clear?

864
01:18:29,706 --> 01:18:31,539
Y-you're clear.
Okay.

865
01:18:38,247 --> 01:18:43,184
If somebody ate me, all my,
like, rage and my sexual,
you know, energy

866
01:18:43,186 --> 01:18:45,953
will go into that per--
and I got a lot of it.

867
01:18:48,023 --> 01:18:50,291
Is she here yet?
Nope.

868
01:18:51,593 --> 01:18:53,561
Make sure there's
a Martini waiting for her.

869
01:18:57,065 --> 01:18:58,599
Oh! Yo, yo, yo.

870
01:18:58,601 --> 01:19:01,001
I want everyone to stop
for one second

871
01:19:01,003 --> 01:19:02,903
and look up here,
pay your respects

872
01:19:02,905 --> 01:19:04,605
to the man who made
this possible.

873
01:19:04,607 --> 01:19:07,108
Frank Riley, everyone.
Raise a glass.

874
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:10,211
Frank, you've really
outdone yourself.

875
01:19:10,213 --> 01:19:11,879
Cheers. Thank you, frank.

876
01:19:11,881 --> 01:19:13,514
Mmm.

877
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:17,585
All right now,
you just gotta do it.

878
01:19:17,587 --> 01:19:18,919
Just toss it in there.

879
01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:35,903
Thanks.

880
01:19:35,905 --> 01:19:37,371
Wow.

881
01:19:37,373 --> 01:19:39,440
Look at you.

882
01:19:39,442 --> 01:19:43,978
This is pretty cool, Frankie.
This is pretty fucking cool.

883
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:45,780
Yeah, it's all right.

884
01:19:45,782 --> 01:19:47,882
I'm sorry that I'm late.

885
01:19:47,884 --> 01:19:49,216
I'm used to it.

886
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:52,052
They need you
back there.

887
01:19:52,054 --> 01:19:53,988
Yeah, I gotta--
go. I know.

888
01:19:53,990 --> 01:19:56,123
We can talk later.

889
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:57,958
Hazel will take care of you.

890
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,095
What should I order?

891
01:20:01,097 --> 01:20:04,698
The first meal I ever made you.
It's on the menu.

892
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:33,194
So, I got
some other good news.

893
01:20:34,629 --> 01:20:36,297
Okay.

894
01:20:36,299 --> 01:20:38,065
I'm back to being me.

895
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:43,270
That psycho--
i sent him home.

896
01:20:45,106 --> 01:20:47,508
That's 'cause
I'm not around.

897
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:49,076
That's not true.

898
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:54,415
Lola--
why do you want me back?

899
01:21:03,491 --> 01:21:07,962
Because all the reasons
to stay away-- they don't work.

900
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:14,902
And every day I tell myself,
"yeah, you blew it."

901
01:21:16,137 --> 01:21:17,705
"Get over it."

902
01:21:20,909 --> 01:21:22,810
And every morning
when I wake up,

903
01:21:22,812 --> 01:21:25,246
first thing
i think of is you.

904
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:30,117
Do you still love me?

905
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:37,725
I wouldn't be here
if I didn't.

906
01:21:40,929 --> 01:21:43,664
It's your...
Big day.

907
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:48,502
Now it's your triumph.
It's so well-deserved.

908
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:05,986
I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna go get changed...

909
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:08,489
And you think about it.

910
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,828
And if you're here
when I come back...

911
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:17,798
I'll have my answer.

912
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:22,436
Okay?

913
01:22:24,205 --> 01:22:25,506
Okay.

914
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:36,050
I'll be back.
