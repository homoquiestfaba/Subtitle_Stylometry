1
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,654
They found another one.

2
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:17,389
There's going to be
no treasure left

3
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:18,953
by the time she gets here!

4
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,124
Mark the location!

5
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,065
That's the Frenchman!

6
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:25,730
And over there, Kristos.

7
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:26,829
They're all coming.

8
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,703
All except one.

9
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:31,869
All right, follow Kristos.

10
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,003
When he dives,

11
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,137
we dive.

12
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,203
Maybe we'll get lucky

13
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,374
and find whatever it is
that's down there.

14
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:42,010
Hey, look at that, Jimmy. Look.

15
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,885
Why isn't she slowing down?

16
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:53,826
-You were asking?
-I knew it.

17
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,070
-Whoa!
-Whoo!

18
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:14,681
Hello, boys.

19
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,381
You're all wet.

20
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:17,523
Half the world's raiders
are already here,

21
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:20,253
Half the world's raiders
are already here,

22
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:21,418
and you make us wait.

23
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:24,088
But you know
I can't resist a bit of fun.

24
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:27,195
Huh.

25
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,256
Lara, tell us,

26
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,629
what's all this fuss about?

27
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:30,862
What does everybody think

28
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,131
is down there?

29
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,229
Well, I don't know

30
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,773
what everybody thinks
is down there,

31
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,866
but... I think
it's the Luna Temple.

32
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,968
The Luna Temple?

33
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,570
My sons-- if it's
not on television,

34
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:42,706
forget it.

35
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,545
It's a temple built
by Alexander the Great.

36
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,414
Who was Greek,
in case you don't know.

37
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:47,748
Yeah, yeah.

38
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,946
Alexander collected treasures

39
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:49,954
from all over the world.

40
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,285
He stored them in two places.

41
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,392
The majority went to his library
in Egypt,

42
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,555
but his
most prized possessions

43
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,997
went here-- the Luna Temple.

44
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,900
By law, no one was allowed
to record its location.

45
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,597
And in 330 B.C. it was...

46
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,162
...swallowed by the sea.

47
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,403
Destroyed during
a volcanic eruption.

48
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,602
Lost forever.

49
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,976
Until yesterday.

50
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,139
Ah.

51
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:16,579
If even half the temple

52
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,048
is intact, it will still be

53
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:20,085
the greatest find
since the pyramids.

54
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,620
The others head
into this area here

55
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:22,677
along this shelf.

56
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:23,744
And that's based

57
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,586
-on the currents?
-Yes.

58
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,252
Ah. This, Gus,
was why I was late.

59
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,691
Oh.

60
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:32,856
It's a geological,
taken two hours after the quake.

61
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:36,026
The epicenter was here
five miles northeast of us.

62
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:39,435
But look at the currents
along the shelf now.

63
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,066
Wait. They've shifted.

64
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:46,703
So, while they're
all diving there,

65
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,270
the ruins will actually be...

66
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,477
Here.

67
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,155
Let's go.

68
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,307
Something wrong?

69
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:23,604
First, Alexander doesn't record
the temple's location.

70
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:26,243
Then God wipes it from the Earth
with a volcano.

71
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:30,186
Now even the currents change.

72
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:34,522
Lara, maybe this temple's
not meant to be found.

73
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:38,121
Everything lost
is meant to be found.

74
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,428
Don't worry.

75
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,955
It's unbelievable!

76
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,962
Whoo!

77
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,259
Oh, my God.

78
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,766
This is huge.

79
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:04,370
Wonderful.

80
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:08,209
Jimmy, this is wonderful.

81
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,508
Do you see what I see?

82
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,174
Oh, my God.

83
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,219
-Oh, my God.
-It's incredible.

84
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,049
Nicky, look at this.

85
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,113
We're going to be rich.

86
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,755
Hey, Lara,

87
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:26,024
what do you say
to two handsome Greek partners?

88
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:29,829
Well, when you find two,
let me know.

89
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,233
Hey, she's talking about you.

90
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,931
No, you.

91
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,542
Pack the gold coins.

92
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,668
Give me that.
Give me that.

93
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,874
Lara, what is that?

94
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,545
It's mine.

95
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,490
What is she doing?

96
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,127
Lara, that column
is collapsing!

97
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,199
Aftershock!

98
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,432
I think that's
a sign to leave!

99
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,997
Two minutes.

100
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:16,175
Lara, we need to leave now!

101
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,200
Lara, we need to leave now!

102
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,835
We've got to move!

103
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:31,054
Keep packing.

104
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,283
This thing is gonna collapse!

105
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,289
You take those two.

106
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:36,020
We have to hurry up!

107
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,029
We've got to go.
We've got to go now! Come on!

108
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,530
Okay.

109
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,833
Lara!

110
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,620
Lara!

111
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:36,956
Lara, it's us.

112
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,656
Hillary and Bryce!

113
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,391
She's disorientated.

114
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:43,992
That's normal after three days.

115
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:46,503
Nice day for a dip?

116
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,742
Gentlemen...

117
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,369
there is an expression:

118
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:57,710
"It's not nice
to fool Mother Nature."

119
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,479
Yet that is precisely
what I've been doing

120
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:01,780
for some time now.

121
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,191
Whether it be sarin gas
for Mr. San...

122
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,955
improved typhoid

123
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,190
for Mr. Krev to use
in the Balkans...

124
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:14,528
enhanced cholera
for Mr. Duvalier.

125
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,158
But...

126
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:19,227
while these weapons
serve their purpose,

127
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,033
there have always been
limitations.

128
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:25,565
Stable diseases aren't lethal.

129
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:28,636
Deadly ones burn out
too quickly.

130
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:33,208
Mother Nature can only be fooled
so much.

131
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,752
Deploy my weapon,

132
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,721
and your enemies--
however great--

133
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,951
will collapse from within.

134
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,522
Rather like Mr. Monza
is collapsing right now.

135
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:00,001
What the hell is going on?

136
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,411
Monza told Ml6
about this meeting.

137
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,847
That's why the change
of location.

138
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,317
He was going to turn
me over to them

139
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,616
and then seek
asylum in the West.

140
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,416
A smart man would have
known I was on to him.

141
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,088
He would never have
got on the plane.

142
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,994
But I knew you would, Mr. Monza,

143
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:22,863
because you actually
thought you could fool me.

144
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,937
That, gentlemen,

145
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,738
is the sound
of a traitor dying.

146
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,379
That was an accelerated form
of Ebola,

147
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,253
deadliest disease known to man.

148
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,986
Highly contagious.

149
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,929
However...

150
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,898
as with all known diseases,

151
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,960
there exist stockpiles
of antiserum in the West.

152
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,156
There is no antiserum

153
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,395
for what I am offering you.

154
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,097
No treatment.

155
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,230
No vaccine, no cure.

156
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,137
The modern world has never seen

157
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,199
anything like
what I've uncovered.

158
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:39,403
"Uncovered"?

159
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,605
Yes, I've branched out.

160
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,944
Archaeology.

161
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:48,885
Zero-seven-seven-four-four

162
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,945
six-eight-one.

163
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,584
That is the account
at the largest bank in Bern.

164
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,221
$1 00 million each,
if you please.

165
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,280
Where's Chen Lo?

166
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:26,119
He's got the orb,
but Ml6 is on to him.

167
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:27,180
How?

168
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,284
He doesn't know,
but rather than risk

169
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,090
bringing it here,
he's waiting.

170
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,290
I have just told
a cabin full of men

171
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:34,865
about Pandora.

172
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,594
The clock cannot be reset.

173
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:39,466
Tell Chen Lo to bring
the orb to me at once.

174
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,222
You'll find the killers!

175
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,054
Don't take it out on me!

176
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:03,955
Ya!

177
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,553
Ya!

178
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:17,699
Ya!

179
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,271
Bryce! What have we got?

180
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,142
Well, I haven't even finished
loading the images

181
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:23,408
from your camera yet.

182
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,083
What about references to an orb?

183
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:32,123
I took the liberty of checking.

184
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,748
Historical inventories
of the Luna Temple

185
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:34,757
do not list any orb.

186
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,623
Then I want you both to list

187
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:39,391
every orb ever mentioned
in Greek history.

188
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,624
Every one?

189
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:41,688
Ha!

190
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:47,929
Ah...

191
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:51,274
Ya!

192
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:52,207
That's...

193
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,268
Iiable...

194
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,370
to be...

195
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:00,612
...thousands.

196
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,624
Then we'll read thousands.

197
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,652
Start with that one.

198
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:09,142
Perhaps you gentlemen would
like some tea while you wait?

199
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,654
No, they wouldn't.

200
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:13,520
Tea is for guests.
The door is for intruders.

201
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:17,425
Lara, these men are from Ml6.

202
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:18,520
Yes, I can tell

203
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,895
from their soft hands
and pressed suits

204
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,866
that these are the men
who make decisions

205
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:23,901
and leave the dirty
work for others.

206
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,698
I have no interest in...

207
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:27,204
His name's Chen Lo.

208
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:28,830
Along with his brother Xien,

209
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:32,240
he runs a ring of Chinese
bandits known as the Shay-Ling.

210
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,436
They deal in guns,

211
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,275
diamonds, antiquities,
anything that Chen Lo

212
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,110
can sell on the black market.

213
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,776
They followed you from the
moment you arrived in Santorini,

214
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:42,046
where they killed your friend,
Gus, and sank his boat.

215
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,052
Why?

216
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:44,179
For this.

217
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,281
After you were
picked up at sea,

218
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,689
our listening post in Malta
intercepted that fax.

219
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,457
It was sent from Chen Lo
to a man named Jonathan Reiss.

220
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:55,295
What, the scientist?
Won the Nobel Prize.

221
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:56,629
He's now
the foremost designer

222
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:58,225
of biological weapons
in the world.

223
00:23:58,303 --> 00:23:59,861
His creations have been
at the heart

224
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,634
of every act of bioterror
in the past 1 5 years.

225
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:05,437
Reiss's disdain
for life is legendary.

226
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,034
He has no political agenda.

227
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,546
He doesn't care
who his weapons kill, or why.

228
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,041
A modern-day Dr. Mengele.

229
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:20,588
We know Chen Lo followed you
in order to obtain the orb,

230
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,456
but we also know that
he'll deliver Reiss.

231
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:24,017
What we don't know is why.

232
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:25,756
Candidly, that terrifies us.

233
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:28,629
Reiss is not to be trifled with.

234
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,793
Pandora's box.

235
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:37,399
Reiss is going to use the orb
to find Pandora's box.

236
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:40,267
Do you mean the Greek myth?

237
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:43,143
Pandora's given a box by God,
told not to open it.

238
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:45,615
She does and unleashes
pain into the world?

239
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:49,085
That's the Sunday school
version, yes.

240
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,145
How do you think life began?

241
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,487
Shooting star,
primordial ooze?

242
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,957
In 2300 BC,
an Egyptian pharaoh

243
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,019
found a place that he named

244
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:02,624
the Cradle of Life,
where we, life, began.

245
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,999
And there, he found a box,

246
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,594
the box which brought
life to Earth.

247
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,161
The pharaoh opened the box,

248
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,936
but all that was left inside
was the Ramante, or anti-life.

249
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,806
The plague which came as
the companion

250
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,038
to life.

251
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:15,079
Companion?

252
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:16,943
Nature is about balance.

253
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,243
All the world comes in pairs.

254
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,648
Yin and Yang.
Right and wrong. Men and women.

255
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:21,743
What's pleasure without pain?

256
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,014
What did this plague do?

257
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:25,022
It leveled the pharaoh's army.

258
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:28,116
The pharaoh's son dispatched
his finest soldier

259
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,424
to take the box and transport it
to the end of the world.

260
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:37,498
2,000 years later, Alexander
the Great reached lndia,

261
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,833
where his army was ravaged

262
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,702
by a plague,
after one of his men

263
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:43,502
found a box among some remains.

264
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:46,271
India? That's where
the pharaoh's man brought it?

265
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:49,141
Mmm. Alexander felt
that the box was too powerful

266
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,613
to be trusted to any man,

267
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:53,583
so he returned it to its home
in the Cradle of Life.

268
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,253
And it has never
been seen since.

269
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,790
And this... Cradle of Life
is where?

270
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,189
No one knows.

271
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:03,591
Alexander found it using
a map that was with the box.

272
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,960
A map he then hid
from the world.

273
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,795
But the name he gave
this map was Mati.

274
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:13,031
And the literal translation
for the word "Mati" is "eye."

275
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:15,734
The orb is the map,

276
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:18,435
hidden in the Luna Temple
by Alexander.

277
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,502
And Reiss will use it
to find Pandora's box.

278
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,980
And when he does,
when he opens it,

279
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,983
he will unleash a weapon
more powerful

280
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:27,575
than you could ever imagine.

281
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:35,055
The markings definitely form
a pattern, but...

282
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:36,889
even if I figure out
what they represent,

283
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,429
we still can't read
the whole map,

284
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,794
because... we've only got
a partial view of it, you see?

285
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:43,265
Well, we have to figure out
how to read it.

286
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,836
Right. Thank you.

287
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:47,132
On behalf of Her Majesty,

288
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:48,797
we formally request
that you find

289
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,773
and recover this box
before Dr. Reiss.

290
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:52,275
Oh!

291
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,038
Well, now that I have
Her Majesty's permission...

292
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,809
Tell me where
to find the orb.

293
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:00,316
Last we heard, it was
somewhere in China

294
00:27:00,385 --> 00:27:01,511
with Chen Lo
and the Shay-Ling.

295
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:03,076
Finding them will be
next to impossible,

296
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:04,985
but we'll assign two
of our best agents to help.

297
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,217
I don't want them.

298
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,089
With all due respect, expertise
in archaeology doesn't...

299
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,151
I didn't say that
I don't need help,

300
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:13,060
but your agents
will never get me

301
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,189
to Chen Lo in time.

302
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,631
I need an insider,
someone who knows

303
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:17,963
the Shay-Ling.

304
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:20,937
Their methods, their hideouts.

305
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:24,701
I need Terry Sheridan.

306
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:25,834
Not in a million years.

307
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,707
Not if he were the
last man on Earth.

308
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:31,913
Terry Sheridan--
formerly a commander

309
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:35,475
with the Royal Marines,
turned mercenary and traitor.

310
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:37,077
You don't honestly expect me

311
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,248
to put that man on the trail
of a weapon

312
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:42,292
he can turn around and sell
to the highest bidder?

313
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:58,400
Open.

314
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:01,472
I am your host...

315
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:03,138
Armin Kal.

316
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:05,648
Welcome to Fantasy lsland.

317
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,262
Croft.

318
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:02,067
Hello, Terry.

319
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:11,179
So, what do you think
of my new place?

320
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,013
It's not quite Croft Manor.

321
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,089
What? A key to your heart?

322
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,784
To a flat in Zurich.

323
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:24,753
You can pick another city,
if you want.

324
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,592
Your record will be expunged,

325
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:27,688
your citizenship restored.

326
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:28,698
By?

327
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,699
Ml6.

328
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,735
Ml6.

329
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,202
Now, would that make me Faust...

330
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,932
or the Devil?

331
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:36,234
Well,
you can pick one,

332
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,935
because Ml6 will also arrange
a new identity.

333
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,240
Oh, yeah?
You think I need their help?

334
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:43,814
Oh, having two faces
doesn't count.

335
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,441
So, what do I have to do?

336
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,249
You need to take me
to the Shay-Ling.

337
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:51,447
The Shay who?

338
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:52,922
There's a man named Chen Lo

339
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:55,516
who took something from me,
and I want it back.

340
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:56,719
Yeah, now, is that you

341
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:57,955
or Ml6?

342
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,656
Also, I've arranged
for the government

343
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:02,063
to wire you five million
in sterling when we succeed.

344
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,065
You can call it

345
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,499
second-chance money.

346
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:06,434
Or life insurance, for you.

347
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:08,062
I don't need any.

348
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,077
You and l, working alone?

349
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,841
Well, it's easier
to see through you that way.

350
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,940
So, what if afterwards,

351
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:22,248
Ml6 decides
that me back in the world

352
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,481
isn't such a great idea?

353
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:27,957
Then I feel sorry for whomever
they get to come after you.

354
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:35,291
Do you have authorization
to kill me, Croft?

355
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,096
Anytime, for any reason.

356
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,763
So, why don't you
just do it, then?

357
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,137
What is it they say?

358
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,436
"Hell hath no fury."

359
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,170
You're not that good.

360
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:50,305
The Shay-Ling
are like ghosts, Croft.

361
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:52,473
They move constantly,

362
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,541
and their home
is the most remote

363
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,211
mountain region in China.

364
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:57,754
Region?

365
00:30:57,822 --> 00:31:00,382
You'll have to do better
than that.

366
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:15,034
Get me into China,

367
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:17,370
and I'll get you
to them in a day.

368
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:19,808
No guns, no money,

369
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,505
no weapons of any kind.

370
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:24,480
Talk about taking
the fun out of life.

371
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:42,431
The Shay-Ling have spies
all over China.

372
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,525
We have to get into
the country undetected.

373
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:47,298
So, we slip into Beijing,
and we go by truck.

374
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,838
Truck? Hmm.

375
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:52,673
I was thinking about something
a little faster.

376
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,216
A little faster?

377
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,911
Well, this is a little faster,

378
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:06,889
but the Chinese
will track the pod.

379
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:10,927
There won't be any pod to find.

380
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:12,360
Will there be
any of us to find?

381
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:22,037
Ready? Now.

382
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,232
Ready for what?

383
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,159
The ditching was good, Croft.

384
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:45,889
I'll give you that.

385
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:49,297
But we're never going to find
a vehicle in a place like this.

386
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,737
Oh, it's so lovely to see you.

387
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,007
So, is everything ready?

388
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:04,013
Yes.

389
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:05,379
Your clothes, guns

390
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,418
and knives are over there.

391
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:12,616
And I took the liberty
of tuning your bike.

392
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,622
May l?

393
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:14,658
Yes.

394
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,969
Lara.

395
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:35,877
Ah, what is
the happy couple up to?

396
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,039
Accessorizing.

397
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:39,777
Where are we on reading the orb?

398
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,820
All maps have a key, Lara,
a scale, a legend, yes?

399
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:44,787
The orb's key,
it's not on the orb.

400
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,050
It must've been lost.

401
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:47,989
Or is somewhere in the temple.

402
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,993
Go through every image I took.

403
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:52,154
Start with the ones
near the orb.

404
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,290
The key must have been linked
to it in some way.

405
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,834
Right.
Bye, then.

406
00:33:57,902 --> 00:34:00,666
It's unlike Lara
to take a partner.

407
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:02,706
Where are you two going?

408
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:05,038
We'll take a nice little trip.

409
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:08,010
Breathe some fresh mountain air.

410
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,242
Stop by my friends,
the Shay-Ling.

411
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,690
The Shay-Ling watch
all the roads.

412
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:26,923
We'll have to go

413
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,090
around the back.

414
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,861
We'll go straight.

415
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,595
Maybe you didn't hear me.

416
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:34,103
The Shay-Ling have
men on every road

417
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,537
from here to Lo Yang.

418
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:38,598
Not every road.

419
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,038
A bit rusty, are we?

420
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,601
Oh, I think it's coming back.

421
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:17,477
I expected more from a Scot.

422
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:19,038
I don't expect anything

423
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,550
from an Englishwoman.

424
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,984
Good, 'cause you're not
going to get anything.

425
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,218
Fun's over.

426
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:06,159
From now on, it's by foot.

427
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,629
Best to reconsider
that "no gun" rule.

428
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:14,193
No.

429
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,332
Okay.

430
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:27,640
And don't be looking at my ass.

431
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,610
So, where do I fit in?

432
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,178
What do you mean?
You're the guide.

433
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:34,520
I mean, when you think back

434
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,219
on the vast scheme

435
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:37,886
of your
hugely adventurous life...

436
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:40,658
where do I fit in?

437
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:42,255
Was I the love of your life,

438
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,130
or just another bump
on the road?

439
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,067
Was I time well spent?

440
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,729
Four months?

441
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:51,172
More good than bad?

442
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:53,870
Come on, it had to be
more than that, am I right?

443
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,580
You're right.

444
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:59,741
It was five months.

445
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:04,420
-You're laughing at me.
-No, no.

446
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:06,217
At the fact,
I used to find you charming.

447
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:10,184
I am charming.

448
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:13,394
Hmm.

449
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:38,987
You're late.

450
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:45,685
Tilt your head back.

451
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,196
Do it!

452
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:54,064
You might see again
in an hour. Maybe.

453
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:06,882
What's this?

454
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,715
It's not there.

455
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,220
There's no orb.

456
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:14,381
Is there anything
you can tell me about this?

457
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:31,603
Hello.

458
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:34,076
I take it you didn't
like your messenger.

459
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,339
I didn't.

460
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:37,574
But I did like the men
I lost in the temple.

461
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,344
You underestimated
Lady Croft.

462
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:44,548
I underestimated how much
this orb is worth.

463
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:47,853
There's so many horrible
diseases in the world...

464
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:51,190
things we are particularly
susceptible to as children.

465
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:53,457
You never know
when you could be holding

466
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:55,260
Iittle Shiho or Tai by the hand

467
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:58,767
as a mysterious ailment
ravages their bodies.

468
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:03,830
You kill them, and I will give
your orb to Lady Croft.

469
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:05,375
My men tell me

470
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,638
she is a few miles away
from here, as we speak.

471
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,306
I wonder how much she would pay.

472
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:13,441
I'll pay you an additional
12 million dollars.

473
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,111
It will be yours,
once you've delivered

474
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:19,156
the orb to me,
along with Lady Croft's body.

475
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:21,214
I don't think you know
where they are.

476
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,190
You're impossible,
you know that?

477
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:26,821
I think you pretended to know,
so I would get you out.

478
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:28,023
This isn't a tomb, Croft,

479
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:29,657
and the Shay-Ling
aren't mummies.

480
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:31,429
They're killers.

481
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:34,471
But if you don't trust me...

482
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:42,877
I'm sorry to have to do this,
but you're wasting time.

483
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:48,012
You want to shoot me?
Shoot me.

484
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:51,577
Personally,
I'd rather you do it...

485
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:52,952
than them.

486
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:14,111
Well, Terry...

487
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:16,510
what part of
"Never come back again!"

488
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,740
didn't you understand?

489
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,617
You wanted to find
the Shay-Ling.

490
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,053
Come on!

491
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:30,457
The only way to get into their
place is as their prisoners.

492
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:33,292
Ah, you might have told me
that little gem before.

493
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,058
Ah, you would have believed me?

494
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:37,532
Make Chen Lo a better
offer than his buyer.

495
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,262
He'll cross them.

496
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:41,463
Even if his buyer
is Jonathan Reiss?

497
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:45,674
You might have told me
that little gem before.

498
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,852
Were you really
going to kill me?

499
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:34,948
Oh, I bet she would have.

500
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:36,720
I have seen her in action.

501
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:38,261
Didn't Terry tell you?

502
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:43,232
The last time any of us saw him,
he was riding away with a truck

503
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,599
full of my Ming vases.

504
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,298
And sitting next to him...

505
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:52,102
was his sister.

506
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,903
Well, how is she?

507
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:59,541
You... shouldn't
have come here.

508
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:02,518
It got me out of prison.

509
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:04,918
Besides, the lady
has a good offer.

510
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:06,479
Better than Reiss.

511
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:08,855
Really?

512
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:10,188
Should I take it?

513
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:11,751
Take it.

514
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,456
Or, better yet,

515
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,396
you and I ransom
her and the thing

516
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,297
back to the British for triple.

517
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,431
Let's talk.

518
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:22,731
Not you, Terry.

519
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:25,832
Lady Croft and l.

520
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,844
You wait here.

521
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,706
Catch up.

522
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:33,045
I'll be four minutes.

523
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,951
Terrific.

524
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:39,749
There's something

525
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:41,154
I think you will appreciate.

526
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,293
This is the largest group

527
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:55,837
of terra-cotta warriors
I have found.

528
00:42:55,906 --> 00:43:00,002
The King of Chin made them
for use in the afterlife...

529
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:03,911
to fend off enemies
he made in this one.

530
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:07,075
Hmm. Sounds like we
could both use a set.

531
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:10,382
I would be happy
to sell some to you.

532
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:13,855
I hope you're as entrepreneurial
with the orb.

533
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,620
You lost men, I lost men.

534
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:19,754
I see no reason
we should both lose again.

535
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,355
If I want double what
Reiss offered me?

536
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,264
Is it here?

537
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:25,267
It's worth a lot.

538
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:26,860
Well, then, if you know that,

539
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,234
you know Reiss
will also kill you

540
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:29,567
the moment you give it to him.

541
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,768
And your government will
guarantee my safety?

542
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:33,969
No.

543
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:36,706
But I will.

544
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,874
That must hurt,
saying that to me.

545
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,441
Take the offer.

546
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:53,124
You presume to give me orders?

547
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:55,961
Take the offer,
before it expires.

548
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:57,557
No.

549
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,796
Then I will have to force you.

550
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:01,098
Then I will have to kill you.

551
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:36,697
Oh...

552
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:14,577
Has it been four minutes yet?

553
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:01,249
That was nice.

554
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:07,223
It's too bad
you're on the wrong side.

555
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:10,926
Tell me where the orb is,
and it spares your life.

556
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:16,704
The flower pagoda, in Shanghai.

557
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,674
9:00 p.m.

558
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,676
This is mine.

559
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:34,320
Now we're even.

560
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:48,638
Now!

561
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,814
Remember that "no gun" rule?

562
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:11,156
I reconsidered!

563
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,626
I know there's a staircase
we could've used.

564
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,002
I am alone

565
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,979
Then I swore

566
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:08,609
¡ÓWhen you were
the last... high¡Ó

567
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:12,621
¡ÓHigh...¡Ó

568
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:14,520
Lara, are you all right?

569
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,853
Smashing.

570
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:17,689
I'm on my way to Shanghai,

571
00:48:17,761 --> 00:48:20,525
and I need you to look
at something for me.

572
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:22,929
It was in the Luna Temple
near the orb.

573
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,800
And I'm betting it's the key
to those markings.

574
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:29,998
She's holding some sort
of musical instrument.

575
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:33,977
It's sound.

576
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:35,875
That's brilliant.

577
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:37,937
The key must have been linked
to it in some way.

578
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:38,947
I'll start decoding

579
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:40,244
-the images we have.
-Good.

580
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:41,579
You get us the rest.
Bye, Lara.

581
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:43,950
-Bye.
-Miss you.

582
00:49:53,385 --> 00:49:55,478
Oh, well.

583
00:49:55,553 --> 00:49:57,316
Just like old times.

584
00:50:02,327 --> 00:50:03,919
I think that's the first time

585
00:50:03,995 --> 00:50:07,487
you've actually smiled
because of me.

586
00:50:14,072 --> 00:50:15,699
Why did you do it?

587
00:50:15,774 --> 00:50:18,174
I started thinking.

588
00:50:18,243 --> 00:50:20,939
I was tired of doing things
somebody else's way,

589
00:50:21,012 --> 00:50:23,845
and it was always going
to be somebody else's way.

590
00:50:23,915 --> 00:50:26,816
So, you abandon your men
and betray your country?

591
00:50:26,885 --> 00:50:30,286
Leaving my men and my country,

592
00:50:30,388 --> 00:50:33,516
that didn't actually hurt
as much as I thought.

593
00:50:33,591 --> 00:50:35,491
But leaving you did.

594
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:38,290
Mm.

595
00:50:38,396 --> 00:50:42,230
You're a hard act to follow,
Croft.

596
00:50:47,105 --> 00:50:50,404
You know why you and I get along
so well?

597
00:50:50,475 --> 00:50:52,170
No.

598
00:50:53,912 --> 00:50:55,812
We are two of a kind,
me and you.

599
00:50:59,684 --> 00:51:01,151
We are nothing alike.

600
00:51:01,219 --> 00:51:04,052
I don't think we're alike,

601
00:51:04,122 --> 00:51:06,249
but I do think we're a pair.

602
00:51:06,391 --> 00:51:10,487
Opposite sides
of the same coin.

603
00:51:33,852 --> 00:51:36,184
My men have the roof covered.

604
00:51:36,254 --> 00:51:39,052
Why don't you set down
in the square instead?

605
00:51:39,124 --> 00:51:41,752
That way, my men will also
have things covered.

606
00:51:41,826 --> 00:51:43,157
Okay, fine.

607
00:51:44,028 --> 00:51:46,087
Okay, Sean, let's go!

608
00:51:49,634 --> 00:51:52,933
They're landing in the square.

609
00:51:53,004 --> 00:51:55,734
We're in the wrong position.

610
00:51:55,807 --> 00:51:56,739
Stairs?

611
00:51:56,808 --> 00:51:57,706
No time.

612
00:51:57,775 --> 00:51:58,707
-Rooftops?
-No.

613
00:51:58,776 --> 00:52:00,744
I've got a plan.

614
00:52:00,812 --> 00:52:01,938
Stay here.

615
00:52:02,013 --> 00:52:04,038
Wait for my signal.

616
00:52:06,351 --> 00:52:08,478
Here's the money!

617
00:52:08,553 --> 00:52:10,043
Come and get it!

618
00:52:18,062 --> 00:52:19,586
Wait for my signal, huh?

619
00:52:19,664 --> 00:52:20,824
Give me that box!

620
00:52:20,899 --> 00:52:22,491
You give me my money first!
Come on!

621
00:52:22,567 --> 00:52:23,795
Give me that box now!

622
00:52:23,868 --> 00:52:25,460
No, just toss it.

623
00:52:25,537 --> 00:52:26,504
You first!

624
00:52:36,381 --> 00:52:37,780
Quick! Get us out of here!

625
00:52:39,684 --> 00:52:41,174
Take us up!

626
00:53:05,577 --> 00:53:07,204
Take it up!

627
00:53:20,558 --> 00:53:22,958
Go! Run her over!

628
00:53:37,875 --> 00:53:39,035
Yeah?

629
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:40,873
We tried it your way.

630
00:53:40,945 --> 00:53:42,071
Now we do it mine!

631
00:53:42,146 --> 00:53:44,011
Bring it to the top
of the pagoda now!

632
00:53:44,082 --> 00:53:45,572
Okay!

633
00:54:24,722 --> 00:54:26,189
I got you!

634
00:54:36,367 --> 00:54:38,927
Come on! Come on!
Hold it up!

635
00:54:46,477 --> 00:54:49,207
Come closer!
I can't reach it!

636
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,043
Raise it higher!
Higher!

637
00:54:55,019 --> 00:54:56,646
My regards to your brother!

638
00:54:56,721 --> 00:54:58,086
We're too late.

639
00:54:59,791 --> 00:55:02,885
Croft, what are you doing?

640
00:55:13,805 --> 00:55:14,829
Take us up!

641
00:55:19,143 --> 00:55:20,201
Move! Go!

642
00:55:28,019 --> 00:55:29,782
Let's go! Move!

643
00:55:43,267 --> 00:55:45,861
I'm getting tired of you
pointing that thing at me.

644
00:55:45,937 --> 00:55:46,869
Are you okay?

645
00:55:46,938 --> 00:55:48,132
Never better.

646
00:55:48,206 --> 00:55:49,798
Looks like we lost the orb.

647
00:55:51,909 --> 00:55:54,434
Please. You don't think
I'd go vaulting into thin air

648
00:55:54,512 --> 00:55:55,444
for nothing, do you?

649
00:55:55,513 --> 00:55:57,447
I put a tracer on the crate.

650
00:56:00,084 --> 00:56:02,314
Got it. Look.

651
00:56:07,091 --> 00:56:08,786
Impressive.

652
00:56:37,555 --> 00:56:38,579
A weapons lab

653
00:56:38,656 --> 00:56:40,624
in the middle of the city?

654
00:56:40,691 --> 00:56:41,817
No way.

655
00:56:41,893 --> 00:56:44,020
He must've dumped that crate.

656
00:56:44,095 --> 00:56:46,689
No, it's here.

657
00:56:46,764 --> 00:56:49,198
One of the buildings?

658
00:56:49,267 --> 00:56:53,294
No. It's exactly
where we're standing.

659
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:02,975
There's a part of me that always
allowed for the possibility

660
00:57:03,047 --> 00:57:05,038
that Pandora's box
was just a legend,

661
00:57:05,116 --> 00:57:07,914
but now I know it's there.

662
00:57:13,458 --> 00:57:15,221
She escaped.

663
00:57:15,293 --> 00:57:17,693
She has no idea where we are.

664
00:57:17,762 --> 00:57:19,024
We take no chances.

665
00:57:19,096 --> 00:57:22,532
Have everything we need
to manufacture an antidote

666
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,227
transferred to the jet.

667
00:57:28,039 --> 00:57:30,507
I need an out for two people.

668
00:57:30,575 --> 00:57:33,271
Mid-city. Soon.

669
00:57:34,445 --> 00:57:36,003
What, are you crazy?

670
00:57:39,016 --> 00:57:39,983
Are we set?

671
00:57:40,051 --> 00:57:42,281
Piece of cake.

672
00:57:45,923 --> 00:57:48,448
¡Ó...angels cry¡Ó

673
00:57:48,526 --> 00:57:51,620
¡ÓTears from the moon¡Ó

674
00:57:53,798 --> 00:57:56,733
¡ÓFall down like rain¡Ó

675
00:57:58,836 --> 00:58:02,636
¡ÓI reach for you¡Ó

676
00:58:04,542 --> 00:58:07,875
¡ÓI reach in vain...¡Ó

677
00:58:30,868 --> 00:58:34,167
¡ÓI would've done¡Ó

678
00:58:34,238 --> 00:58:37,537
¡ÓAnything for you¡Ó

679
00:58:41,612 --> 00:58:46,174
¡ÓAll day I keep
from falling apart¡Ó

680
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:48,775
¡ÓTears from the moon...¡Ó

681
00:58:55,092 --> 00:58:56,116
Hello.
