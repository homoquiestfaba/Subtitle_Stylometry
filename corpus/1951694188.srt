1
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:21,309
There is an Indian proverb...

2
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,555
"It is easy to be brave...

3
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,064
from a distance.

4
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:49,770
Easy, and often quite safe."

5
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:59,209
Once there was
no honor in killing...

6
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,917
only necessity.

7
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,856
Honor came
with true courage.

8
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:12,292
But that day...

9
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:15,597
is long gone.

10
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,793
Ohiyesa,
go with the others!

11
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:24,693
l said, go!
Go!

12
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,201
The man was a fucking idiot.

13
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:42,207
Splits his forces,
daylight raid, high noon.

14
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,505
An idiot, perhaps,

15
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,774
but he had his orders,
Mr. President.

16
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,906
"Drive the Sioux
out of the Black Hills,

17
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:50,779
onto the ration rolls..."

18
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,944
so that we could get
to that damn gold.

19
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,545
The Sioux resisted.

20
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:58,182
Resisted? Bullshit.

21
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,886
They resisted,
General Sherman.

22
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,953
Blocking a roundhouse
to the chin is resistance, Henry.

23
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:06,191
Massacring
five companies of cavalry--

24
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:09,292
l am not defending
their brutality, Mr. President.

25
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:12,736
The Sioux resisted
because by the '68 treaty

26
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,240
this land is theirs,

27
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,606
and we had no legal--

28
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,634
That treaty was also

29
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,670
only supposed to feed them
for four years,

30
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,182
and yet here we are
eight years later,

31
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,209
and you senators are passing
a million-a-year appropriation

32
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,721
to keep filling their bellies.
Why?

33
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,781
To keep them
from starving, General.

34
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,156
And that's all it's done--

35
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:36,787
made them beggars.
Hasn't advanced them one bit.

36
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,798
- And those smart enough not to sign--
- Do this.

37
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,494
They were attacked
by us first.

38
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,032
And what would you have us do,
Dawes? Cut and run?

39
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:51,976
Mr. President, this is
a senseless argument.

40
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,911
A senseless argument?

41
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:56,813
You know what they did
to those men on that hill?

42
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:06,622
They did things even l've
never seen before.

43
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,891
Henry?

44
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:16,561
The survival of the Indian
is your deepest concern, isn't that so?

45
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,934
You know it is.

46
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,269
l thought it was yours.

47
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,332
And it still is.

48
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:26,004
l appointed an Indian
to the head of Indian Affairs,

49
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,945
l'll remind you.

50
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,915
Another decision that your
colleagues were so fond of.

51
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,316
And another damn knot in the noose
of this administration.

52
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:36,583
Along with a three-year depression
and a bankrupt treasury.

53
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,386
This isn't about money, gentlemen,
this is about human beings.

54
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:42,451
And when you make an agreement,
you have a solemn obligation

55
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,362
- to fulfill--
- In spite of this atrocity...

56
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:49,494
l still believe that setting the Indians
on the course to civilization

57
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,470
best ensures their survival.
Now, do you or do you not agree?

58
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,439
Yes, sir. l do.

59
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,875
Then you can't deny
that there's no saving the Sioux

60
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,276
unless we compel them
to give up their way of life

61
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,372
and settle
on the reservation.

62
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,679
l'll say it till
my tongue bleeds--

63
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:07,743
If we're ever going to claim
what we bought from the French

64
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,778
and whooped
the Mexicans for,

65
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:13,417
it's going to mean
killing Indians.

66
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,248
Whoa.

67
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,989
Your father.

68
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,607
Did you win
this feather?

69
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:44,877
Yes.

70
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,782
In the fight
at the Little Bighorn.

71
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,066
300 of us were to be hanged.

72
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,629
l killed two whites, but
the Great Father Lincoln saved me.

73
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:10,108
He sent me to prison
where my heart was made free.

74
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,042
- Free?
- Yes.

75
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,342
Because l have learned
there is another road

76
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,371
that runs beside
the warpath.

77
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,815
A secret road...

78
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:22,309
only known
to the Christ worshippers.

79
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:27,086
And you came back,
to make us Christ worshippers?

80
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,584
No. l have come
for my son.

81
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,605
O Lord, grant us the wisdom
and strength

82
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,941
to come to a peaceful accord

83
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,971
with our red brothers
here with us today--

84
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,506
Great Chief
of the Oglala Sioux, Red Cloud,

85
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:28,019
his head men--

86
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,887
Young Man
Afraid of His Horses,

87
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:34,415
American Horse, and others.

88
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,224
We beseech you,
O Lord,

89
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:41,723
in the name of Your son
and our savior Jesus Christ.

90
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,726
- Amen.
- Amen.

91
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:52,702
l want to know to which god
the White Robe is praying.

92
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:56,044
The same god whom you deceived
when you made treaty with us

93
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,073
and broke it?

94
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,449
We come to you once again

95
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:03,785
to negotiate for your rights to the
Black Hills and your old hunting ground.

96
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:07,520
l am speaking, or has my medicine
made us invisible to you?

97
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,690
If so, you will not notice
when l lead my people out of here,

98
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,426
back to our lands.

99
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,701
l would like to know how many
of Red Cloud's young bucks

100
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,538
were at the Little Bighorn
with Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse.

101
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:27,034
Those men were hunting,
as the agent permitted.

102
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,444
Indeed they were hunting.

103
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,881
They were hunting
for white scalps.

104
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,853
l am a friend of the Great Father,
President Grant.

105
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,481
And l want to tell you,
he did not wish

106
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,957
for there to be war
between us again.

107
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:43,086
The Great Father
is the chief of all your people,

108
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,926
chosen by them.

109
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:48,127
Did he not order
those soldiers to attack?

110
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,534
Yes, it was
the Great Father's order.

111
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,595
But it did not come
from his heart.

112
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,473
Then l don't understand
how you whites do things.

113
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,071
And now you will place
a paper before us that says,

114
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:04,446
"Give the Black Hills
and your old hunting lands to us

115
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,610
or we will
no longer feed you,

116
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:10,179
and we will kill Sitting Bull
and all those who continue to fight."

117
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:13,350
- Is that not so?
- All right.

118
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,189
Red Cloud has had his say.

119
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:18,128
This new agreement...

120
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:21,133
will ensure
your continued support

121
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,260
and a new home at an agency

122
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,395
to be known... as Pine Ridge.

123
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:29,635
We no longer wish
your support.

124
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,870
We wish to hunt
on the lands

125
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,845
which the treaty
said we may keep.

126
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,848
Only as long as the game abounds.
The game is scarce now.

127
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,112
Because of your hunting
for amusement.

128
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:42,450
The paper you signed
allows for us to lay rail.

129
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,355
You agreed to this
when you touched the pen.

130
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:48,121
l touched the pen
because l wanted peace.

131
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,355
For the past eight snows,

132
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:53,627
my people have been living
like the poorest of whites.

133
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,430
Where are the fine things
you promised?

134
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:59,960
The kind you lavish on us when you
want our mark on your paper?

135
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,565
Chief Red Cloud,
did you or did you not

136
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,906
sign the paper
and advise your people

137
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,935
to do the same?

138
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:11,812
Am l invisible now?
l am speaking to you.

139
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,684
Colonel Miles, enough.

140
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:26,862
l will speak straight to you
because these are the words

141
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,026
of the Great Father
and his people.

142
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,468
You must touch pen
to this paper,

143
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:34,961
or you and your people
will perish.

144
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,568
Soldiers!

145
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,596
Soldiers!

146
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,256
Bear Coat.

147
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,425
They say he was fearless

148
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,662
in the whites' big war
against themselves.

149
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:46,796
Bear Coat was a friend
of Longhair Custer.

150
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,932
He comes for revenge.

151
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,240
Sitting Bull
requested this council.

152
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,110
We await his words.

153
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,207
Take your soldiers
out of here--

154
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,481
- they scare the game away.
- Very well, sir.

155
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,978
Tell me then, how far away
should l take my men?

156
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,014
You must take them
out of our lands.

157
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,425
What precisely
are your lands?

158
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,452
These are the lands

159
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,431
where my people lived
before you whites first came.

160
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:57,299
l don't understand. We whites
were not your first enemies.

161
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,634
Why don't you demand back
the land in Minnesota

162
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:02,231
where the Chippewa and others
forced you from years before?

163
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,333
The Black Hills
are a sacred land

164
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:06,571
given to my people
by Wakan Tanka.

165
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,807
How very convenient

166
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,008
to cloak your claims
in spiritualism.

167
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:14,382
And what would you say
to the Mormons and others

168
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,513
who believe that their god has given
to them Indian lands in the West?

169
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:20,150
l would say they should listen
to Wakan Tanka.

170
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,702
No matter what your legends say,

171
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:35,173
you didn't sprout from the plains
like the spring grasses.

172
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:38,574
And you didn't coalesce
out of the ether.

173
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,875
You came out of the Minnesota
woodlands armed to the teeth

174
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,973
and set upon your fellow man.

175
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,746
You massacred
the Kiowa, the Omaha,

176
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:49,913
the Ponca, the Oto
and the Pawnee without mercy.

177
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:53,015
And yet you claim the Black Hills
as a private preserve

178
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:55,390
bequeathed to you
by the Great Spirit.

179
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:58,419
And who gave us the guns and powder
to kill our enemies?

180
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:01,921
And who traded weapons to the Chippewa
and others who drove us from our home?

181
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:05,698
Chief Sitting Bull, the proposition
that you were a peaceable people

182
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,728
before the appearance
of the white man

183
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,536
is the most
fanciful legend of all.

184
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,770
You were killing each other
for hundreds of moons

185
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,472
before the first white stepped foot
on this continent.

186
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:17,949
You conquered those tribes,
lusting for their game and their lands,

187
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:21,817
just as we have now conquered you
for no less noble a cause.

188
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,844
This is your story
of my people!

189
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,857
This is the truth,
not legend.

190
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:38,361
Crazy Horse
has surrendered...

191
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,167
with his entire band.

192
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:44,107
And by his surrender,
he says to you and your people

193
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,133
that you are defeated.

194
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,669
And by ceding
the Black Hills to us,

195
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:51,342
so say Red Cloud
and the other chiefs,

196
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,408
who demand
that you end this war

197
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,477
and take your place
on the reservation.

198
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,921
Red Cloud
is no longer a chief.

199
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:01,357
He is a woman you have mounted
and had your way with.

200
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,793
Do not speak to me
of Red Cloud!

201
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:06,627
l suppose you
are the only chief then?

202
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:10,260
Sitting Bull is king
of all the Indians.

203
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,463
Ah, humility.

204
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:15,769
It's one of the four virtues
of a Sioux chief.

205
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:19,072
Sitting Bull
shows his true nature now.

206
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,481
l have had my say with you.

207
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:26,075
And l have had my say
with you.

208
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,609
Then we will have a fight.

209
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,622
So be it.

210
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:33,517
Artillery,
prepare to fire a volley.

211
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:46,528
Company,
shoulder arms!

212
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:06,610
Fire at will.

213
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,555
Artillery, reload.

214
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:20,054
Infantry, prepare to fire.

215
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,597
And fire!

216
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,798
Front line, reload!

217
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,970
Fire.

218
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:36,479
Fire. Fire.

219
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:11,646
Front line, reload!

220
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,658
Close ranks!

221
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,071
Platoon...

222
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:36,937
forward!

223
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:45,740
Fires are cold, sir.
They left hours ago.

224
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,718
- Burn it all.
- Yes, sir.

225
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:50,312
Burn it all down--
everything!

226
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:56,354
Get a torch over here.
l don't want to see one tepee standing.

227
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,027
Canada.

228
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,630
Who can give me the names

229
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,695
of the last four presidents?

230
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:23,968
l would call on you,
Ohiyesa,

231
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:27,069
but it must be
by a white name.

232
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:29,171
Have you chosen one
from your book?

233
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:31,512
No, missus.

234
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:34,040
Shall l choose one for you?

235
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,750
No, missus.

236
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:42,992
Raise your hand
only if you can name all four.

237
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:49,030
If just one student
can name all four,

238
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:52,503
l will dismiss you early.

239
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:54,128
Morning, sir.

240
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:57,134
Major Walsh,
Northwest Mounted Police.

241
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,199
People of Canada
have heard of your victory

242
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,368
over the soldiers in Montana.

243
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,243
Queen Victoria believes
the American government

244
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,873
is to blame for this trouble.

245
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:14,351
So you and your people...

246
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:16,615
you're welcome here.

247
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:19,623
l know the Grandmother's heart
for the red man.

248
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:22,990
Now they will learn on the reservation
that we are safe.

249
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:24,824
And Crazy Horse will come.

250
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:28,060
- And many more.
- Crazy Horse?

251
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,226
He was the war chief with you
at the Little Bighorn Valley?

252
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:34,136
He was made to surrender,
but that life is not worth living.

253
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:37,539
No, apparently not, sir.

254
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:40,442
Crazy Horse is dead.

255
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:44,039
He resisted while they were
locking him up for some trouble.

256
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:47,916
If others join you,
they're welcome here.

257
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:51,752
But you cannot use our land as a base
from which to attack the United States.

258
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,817
Nor can you make raids on other tribes
here or interfere with their hunting.

259
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,125
If you do, l'll have to bring
our own soldiers,

260
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:01,564
and force you all to leave.

261
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:06,228
Now, we've brought you
some food and supplies.

262
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:09,672
You'll find buffalo in the valleys
to the north and to the east.

263
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:13,074
l suggest you do your hunting now and
take as much meat and skins as you can.

264
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:15,204
It's not like the Dakota here.

265
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:17,146
Our winters can be harsh.

266
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:28,083
Tomorrow, we will review
fractions and verbs.

267
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,856
Don't forget your homework.

268
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:47,267
You have been chosen
from all the children on the settlement.

269
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:50,748
This woman has come to take you
to a new school in Illinois.

270
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,079
Illinois?

271
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:56,143
If you study as hard there
as you did here, child,

272
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,587
you will go on to college
and study even further.

273
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:01,023
And learn the trade
of the white man.

274
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,290
l don't want to go.

275
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:09,232
Excuse me.

276
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:36,823
The earth belongs
to the white man.

277
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:40,456
There is no future
outside his world.

278
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:43,730
You must go.

279
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,830
You must go.

280
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,177
Everything will be fine.

281
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,287
The Indian today is civilized

282
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:15,190
only in the most elemental sense.

283
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:18,024
His race wears civilized clothes,

284
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:20,326
live in wood houses.

285
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:22,299
They send their children
to schools.

286
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,700
We have reached the point
where the Indian problem

287
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:28,262
should be no different
than the Irish problem

288
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:30,137
or the German problem.

289
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:33,940
Like them, the Indian
has been absorbed.

290
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:36,572
But, unlike them,

291
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:40,050
he has not yet
been assimilated.

292
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:42,552
This can only come

293
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:44,782
when he is educated
to so high a plane

294
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:46,983
of thought and aspiration

295
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,586
as to render his former
savage way of life

296
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:53,688
intolerable to him.

297
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,763
Ladies and gentlemen,

298
00:33:56,801 --> 00:34:00,259
on a late June day in 1876,

299
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:03,398
the young man
l'm about to present to you

300
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:06,342
was nearly killed
by Arikara scouts

301
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,368
attached to the Seventh Cavalry

302
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:11,678
of General
George Armstrong Custer.

303
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:17,745
Yes, l am referring
to the Battle of Little Bighorn.

304
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,219
Once destined for death

305
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:24,251
at the hands of enemy tribes
or U.S. soldiers,

306
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:26,422
he has flourished

307
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,898
as a recipient of The Friends
of the Indian scholarship.

308
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:31,902
From Dartmouth College,

309
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:34,097
where he is soon to graduate,

310
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:36,902
he will, with your
continued support,

311
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:41,002
matriculate at Boston University
Medical School.

312
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,738
Ladies and gentlemen,
l present to you,

313
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:47,978
Ohiyesa of the Sioux,

314
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:51,580
and Mr. Charles Eastman
of the United States of America.

315
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:30,055
A Lakota proverb.
It means...

316
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:32,528
"Tell me,

317
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:35,088
and l will listen.

318
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,896
Show me,

319
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:40,097
and l will understand.

320
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,766
Take me in,

321
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,741
and l will learn."

322
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,853
Elaine. Mrs. Goodale,
and her daughter Elaine,

323
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:08,058
neighbors of mine
from Massachusetts.

324
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,964
- Senator Dawes.
- Lovely to see you.

325
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:13,300
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hello.

326
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,305
Delighted to meet you.

327
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,316
Indeed.

328
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,049
Besides being a student
of Lakota,

329
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:35,684
Elaine is also a published
poetess, Charles.

330
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,925
- Ohiyesa?
- It means "Winner."

331
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:42,398
l won the name in the pony races.

332
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:46,130
And, where did "Charles"
come from?

333
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,035
Well...

334
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:50,597
Eastman is my mother's name.

335
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,905
Her father was a white--

336
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:55,208
don't tell
The Friends of the Indian.

337
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,840
And "Charles"?

338
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:03,613
l was in school one day

339
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,986
and the teacher was mistaken
about something--

340
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:08,890
The name of the chief
of my Sioux tribe.

341
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:12,191
- She called him "Spotted Bear."
- Chief Spotted Bear...

342
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,960
So, l raised my hand because...

343
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:17,832
l felt it was a dishonor
to the chief

344
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:20,166
to misspeak his name.

345
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:23,037
But she wouldn't call on me,

346
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,566
because l hadn't taken
a white name.

347
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:29,205
l just couldn't do it.

348
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:34,509
And l remember her words
as if it were moments ago...

349
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,720
Chief Spotted Bear
could have saved his people.

350
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:42,248
But he chose war instead.

351
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:45,922
"Missus," l cried...

352
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:47,794
l believe you are mistaken.

353
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:50,357
And she turned to me...

354
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:52,266
How shall l address you?

355
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:58,468
Quickly,
the children are waiting.

356
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:09,613
"Charles," l replied.

357
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:11,781
Charles.

358
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:14,689
Charles.
Yes, Charles,

359
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:16,716
what is it
you would like to say?

360
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:21,628
"Excuse me, missus,
l am certain..."

361
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:24,032
l am certain the name of this chief
was Little Crow.

362
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:26,298
"Little Crow."

363
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,737
l believe you are right,
Charles.

364
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:31,139
His name was Little Crow.
Thank you...

365
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:33,200
"Thank you...

366
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:35,735
Charles."

367
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,247
And he did not want war.

368
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:39,772
"He did not...

369
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,682
want war."

370
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:51,184
And this is how

371
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:54,163
l came to be called...

372
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:55,995
Charles.

373
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:08,234
Elaine?

374
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:11,648
l'm sorry.

375
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:14,974
Did l upset you?

376
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,885
No.

377
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:21,516
l'm all right.

378
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:27,189
It's all right.

379
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:44,179
She's not getting any better.

380
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,479
You must talk to him.

381
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:59,828
- Our daughter's getting worse.
- Bring her to me.

382
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:02,424
The cures have not worked.
We need to go back home.

383
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,297
You cannot leave.

384
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:06,326
If you leave,
others will follow.

385
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,736
If you tell the people they must stay,
they will stay.

386
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:11,674
That's what l'm telling you.
You must stay.

387
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:53,796
Morning, sir.

388
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:57,000
These Crow are from the camp
on the Poplar River.

389
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,669
They say they've seen your men
on their hunting ground.

390
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,735
Crow are liars
and they hate us.

391
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:03,679
They've always hated the Sioux.

392
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:06,615
They are liars!

393
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:13,921
There's another problem.
They're missing horses.

394
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:18,088
And they say it's your men who raided
their camp two nights ago.

395
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:21,825
l must ask that you allow them
to look in your corral.

396
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,845
Sir, l must report this.

397
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:48,824
And when l return next, it may be with
men to take you back across the border.

398
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:51,453
Who stole these ponies?

399
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:55,124
Who would see us die like slaves
on the reservation?

400
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:56,792
Who?

401
00:43:58,202 --> 00:43:59,999
Who?!

402
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,674
You will see
how l deal with this thing.

403
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:13,706
- Please, don't do this.
- You must know that l did not know.

404
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:16,117
We cannot be sent back.

405
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:58,785
Enough!

406
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:51,504
Brother...

407
00:45:51,548 --> 00:45:53,778
these men will fight
if they are stopped.

408
00:45:53,817 --> 00:45:56,786
l can't let that happen.

409
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:00,449
Then leave... brother.

410
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:02,425
l won't stop you.

411
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,218
Elaine Goodale
was up the other day

412
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:13,320
to meet the Commissioner
of Indian Affairs.

413
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:15,888
She made quite an impression,
as you'd expect.

414
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:19,232
But l'm afraid you're gonna
have to outdo even her.

415
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:21,066
That would be impossible.

416
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:23,629
Remarkable
young woman.

417
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:26,074
And quite an ally
in our cause.

418
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:28,339
She completes
her teacher's training

419
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:31,040
and she'll be on the Sioux reservation
within months.

420
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:34,141
l know, sir, we've been
corresponding for some time.

421
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:38,018
Have you?
Have you indeed?

422
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:41,115
All right, let us begin.

423
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:44,252
Northern boundary
of the new Pine Ridge Reservation,

424
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:46,592
south fork of the Cheyenne River...

425
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:50,031
downstream to the mouth
of Battle Creek.

426
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:56,130
The Indian
must have full citizenship

427
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:59,336
and a deed in his hands
like any white man.

428
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:02,675
Assimilation, Charles,
or extinction.

429
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:06,308
Gentlemen, the plan we put before you
for the Sioux

430
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:10,548
will be a model for Indians
from the Pequot in Connecticut

431
00:48:10,587 --> 00:48:12,748
to the Pomo in California.

432
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:15,781
Now, step one is the division
of Sioux land

433
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:18,886
into six distinct reservations...

434
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:21,830
Pine Ridge, Rosebud,

435
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:23,765
Cheyenne River,

436
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,325
Standing Rock, Crow Creek...

437
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:30,136
And then, due west
to the 102nd meridian.

438
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:34,908
Step two is the division

439
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:36,879
of each new reservation

440
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,314
into individual tracts.

441
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:42,409
160 acres to each man--

442
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:45,216
to farm, to feed his family,

443
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:47,120
to market his crops,

444
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:48,920
to earn a living.

445
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:50,984
Step three-- thus apportioned,

446
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:53,189
excess lands will be sold

447
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,198
to white settlers.

448
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:57,427
The Sioux and the white man--

449
00:48:57,467 --> 00:49:00,698
neighbors,
partners in business,

450
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:02,830
friends.

451
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:06,570
And with white settlement
of central Dakota, what follows?

452
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,908
The railroads, gentlemen.

453
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:12,541
Straight through
from Pierre to Rapid City,

454
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:16,712
rail service to the Black Hills mines.

455
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:20,385
And...

456
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:22,722
at long last,

457
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:26,991
the Northern Pacific
will see completion.

458
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:30,796
The Sioux will travel,
be exposed to white society,

459
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:33,394
and be influenced by it
as l was.

460
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:36,702
And finally, statehood
for the Dakotas,

461
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:40,437
representation,
governance, business.

462
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:43,537
With your vote on this bill,
gentlemen,

463
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,946
America will be built.

464
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:14,468
- Mr. Naylor of West Virginia.
- Nay.

465
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:18,072
- Mr. Allison of West Virginia.
- Aye.

466
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:20,174
All gentlemen accounted for.

467
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:21,775
The bill has passed.

468
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:24,844
Charles-- Charles...

469
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:28,722
- Congratulations, sir.
- We did it. We did it.

470
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:31,660
This could never have happened
without your help.

471
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,289
Thank you.
Thank you, my boy.

472
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:45,199
These are the borders
of your reservation,

473
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:49,542
as set out in the Black Hills
Agreement of 1876.

474
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:54,414
Now once each parcel
is assigned,

475
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:58,080
you will have a great deal
of unused land.

476
00:50:58,121 --> 00:51:00,612
When this land was first set aside,

477
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:03,820
you could not have sold that
for 10 cents an acre.

478
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,454
However...

479
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:10,398
the Great Council in Washington
has authorized me

480
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:14,336
to offer you
50 cents an acre.

481
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:22,072
Those excess lands
will yield you

482
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:25,673
$5 and a half million.

483
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:30,709
$5 and a half million that will go
right into your pocket

484
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,745
as these lands are sold to whites.

485
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:36,247
Your map does not show the land
we would be giving back to you.

486
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:38,284
Oh.

487
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:45,032
This area in red.

488
00:51:47,871 --> 00:51:51,602
Now this offer
is only possible

489
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:54,701
because the Dakota Southern
would be able to lay rail

490
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:58,475
south of the Cheyenne River
into the Black Hills mines.

491
00:51:58,515 --> 00:52:02,178
So you admit this land has no value
except to lay iron through?

492
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:04,847
No, l do not admit that.

493
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:07,721
These are not my words.

494
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:10,453
Chief Red Cloud?

495
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:13,691
l would like to know
what Chief Red Cloud has to say.

496
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:17,461
Do you believe this proposal
is in the best interest--

497
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:20,402
Every man is a chief here.
You wanted it so.

498
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:22,701
We do not need
to hear his words.

499
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:34,175
How will this money be paid?

500
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:37,880
For every acre of land
the government sells,

501
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:41,084
- the money is yours.
- The money is not ours, then,

502
00:52:41,124 --> 00:52:44,958
until you sell the land
you have taken that is ours.

503
00:52:46,396 --> 00:52:50,389
This land is not to farm.

504
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:52,424
This land is to graze,

505
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:54,994
and we do not eat grass.

506
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:58,474
If we are to take this chance
that the whites may be foolish enough

507
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:00,305
to make their home here,

508
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:03,335
then you must get us more
of this money that we may never see.

509
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,575
Come back
when you have done this.

510
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:07,810
Have you any notion

511
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:10,911
the efforts l have expended
on your behalf?

512
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:12,819
Do you have any idea?

513
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,120
l can't simply come back!

514
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:17,456
There'll be a new Congress.

515
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:20,725
A new Congress may not
authorize any offer at all.

516
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:11,806
Tunkashila,

517
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:14,282
hear my voice today.

518
00:54:16,152 --> 00:54:18,643
Sitting Bull is a great leader
of the Lakota.

519
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:21,156
There is no greater.

520
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:25,388
Thank you
for letting us go, Father.

521
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:28,090
Keep me in your prayers.

522
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:39,216
Finally.

523
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:41,553
It arrived.

524
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,251
What is this?

525
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:20,319
Father, l'm a policeman.

526
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:24,026
Where's the person in charge?
l'll see him now.

527
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:26,535
l'll take you to him.

528
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:37,369
He's here, sir.

529
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:41,208
Yes, l know.

530
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:12,013
Good day, sir.

531
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:15,211
l'm James McLaughlin,
agent here at Standing Rock.

532
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:21,383
Let it be known that I,

533
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:24,655
Tatanka lyotaka, Sitting Bull,

534
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:28,926
was the last chief
to give up his rifle.

535
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,677
Now...

536
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:52,882
the Great Father
has sent me a letter

537
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:55,686
saying that if l came in,

538
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:59,718
l would be Big Chief
of this agency,

539
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:04,222
that you would build me
a fine house on a stream.

540
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:07,794
Do not give me ration tickets--
l will not touch them.

541
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:10,772
l will take all supplies
for all my people

542
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:13,503
and hand them out myself.

543
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:17,070
l will not put in crops.

544
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:19,172
Those things
that grow in the ground

545
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:21,479
my people and l
will gather wild,

546
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:23,348
as we always have.

547
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:27,448
Is this all
you wish to say, sir?

548
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:32,427
l have said all the words
l wish to say... for now.

549
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:35,056
l see.

550
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:39,967
First of all, the Great Father
sent no such letter to you.

551
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:42,403
You will not be a Big Chief,

552
01:00:42,438 --> 01:00:45,532
a Medium-Sized Chief,
nor any sort of chief.

553
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:48,100
Here, you will be the same
as any other man.

554
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:50,669
That is to say, you will be given
materials and loaned men

555
01:00:50,713 --> 01:00:52,476
to build a cabin.

556
01:00:52,515 --> 01:00:54,506
You will have
a horse and wagon.

557
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:58,179
If you do not put in crops, you
will live on your bimonthly rations,

558
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:00,587
and if you do not accept
ration tickets,

559
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:02,557
you and your family
will either be beggars

560
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:04,457
or you will starve.

561
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:08,658
My clerk will add you
to the rolls.

562
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:12,190
And those are all
the words l wish to say.

563
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:24,636
Good day, sir.

564
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:02,207
Beans, one blanket.

565
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:09,457
Flour, one shawl,
seeds.

566
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:11,585
"Pawnee Killer."

567
01:02:11,627 --> 01:02:14,061
"Crow Killer."

568
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:17,396
One blanket,
a suit of clothes,

569
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:19,492
medium-large.

570
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:23,467
Use your flour ration, Chief.

571
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:25,974
You'll fill it out
soon enough.

572
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:29,375
Coffee, two blankets, matches.

573
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:40,215
"Little Feather."
One coat--

574
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:42,417
Sitting Bull.

575
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:47,255
Tatanka lyotaka,

576
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:50,231
they're calling your name.

577
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:53,133
Sitting Bull.

578
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:57,001
Never mind, moving on.

579
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:58,939
l'll accept his issue.

580
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:00,772
You can't do that,
Miss Goodale.

581
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:04,179
l was told by
the commissioner himself

582
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:07,842
that l may assist these people
in any way l see fit.

583
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:10,512
One blanket.

584
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:13,982
One blanket.

585
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,452
Without holes.

586
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:25,497
Thank you.

587
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,504
Father.

588
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:37,411
We are lucky. Here the agent
lets us hunt for our meat.

589
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:39,539
Watch.

590
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,590
One bull.

591
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,101
Whoo! Whoo!

592
01:05:06,502 --> 01:05:08,231
"My dear Charles...

593
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:12,605
the great Sioux reservation
is no longer great in size alone.

594
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:15,236
It is now home
to a great celebrity.

595
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:18,247
Sitting Bull has arrived.

596
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:22,183
But the sorrow in his eyes--

597
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:24,709
it is the image
of all l have seen,

598
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:28,417
and not only
at Standing Rock,

599
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:32,052
but at all the agencies.

600
01:05:34,063 --> 01:05:36,054
At Pine Ridge,

601
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:38,328
a drought destroyed
the late summer crops

602
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:39,766
and made
for underweight cattle.

603
01:05:45,908 --> 01:05:47,808
And then there are
the epidemics--

604
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:50,607
measles, influenza,

605
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:53,046
whooping cough.

606
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:57,886
Have you seen a dying child
with whooping cough?

607
01:05:59,755 --> 01:06:01,746
There is little
that can be done

608
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:04,988
except to prepare the families
for the inevitable.

609
01:06:06,195 --> 01:06:08,720
This has become
my avocation.

610
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:12,693
Sincerely, Elaine."

611
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:16,865
There's a fine line
between incentive and coercion.
