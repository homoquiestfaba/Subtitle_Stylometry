1
00:02:40,826 --> 00:02:42,521
Hey, he's right here.

2
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,723
I've only read about it.

3
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:52,026
I knoW it's extremely rare.

4
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,094
So he can't feel

5
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:57,159
or touch?

6
00:03:57,203 --> 00:04:01,230
No, he responds
to normal touch and pressure.

7
00:04:01,273 --> 00:04:05,107
His body just can't recognize
sensations of pain.

8
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:08,238
Cl is a very
dangerous condition.

9
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,215
He could bite his oWn tongue off
and not even realize it.

10
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,276
He could break a bone
and keep on playing.

11
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,346
Even hot foods have to be checked
before he eats them.

12
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:18,549
Of course.

13
00:04:31,003 --> 00:04:34,029
He has to be checked hourly
for cuts and bruises,

14
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:37,634
and not just his arms and legs,
but his Whole body,

15
00:04:37,676 --> 00:04:39,303
even inside his mouth.

16
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,472
This is very important.

17
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:44,381
Martin can't tell
When something hurts.

18
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,407
Hi there.

19
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,114
I bought this neW bike
for my nepheW's birthday,

20
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:51,385
but he doesn't like the color.

21
00:04:51,423 --> 00:04:53,516
Can you believe that?

22
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,652
I Was gonna just throW it out

23
00:04:55,694 --> 00:04:57,821
When I saW you and I thought,

24
00:04:57,863 --> 00:05:00,297
"There's a kid Who'd probably love
a neW bike."

25
00:05:00,332 --> 00:05:02,698
Am I right?

26
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:05,602
It's right in my truck.
Want to take a look?

27
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:12,675
Do you like red?

28
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:16,613
It's difficult and exhausting.

29
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,117
I've been through
tWo aides already.

30
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:21,176
You don't have to Worry,
Mrs. Bristol.

31
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,780
Whatever you need, I'm here.

32
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,217
Would you like to meet him noW?

33
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:30,092
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

34
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:40,799
Mrs. Bristol:
Oh God.

35
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,331
Martin!

36
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,602
Martin!

37
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:21,396
Don't be afraid.

38
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,307
It doesn't have any feelings.

39
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:36,587
It doesn't hurt, see?

40
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:09,147
No!

41
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:10,985
It'll be over soon.

42
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,925
It's good to see you.

43
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,263
HoW are you holding up?

44
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,606
Okay.

45
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:16,542
You know, you Were here
once before.

46
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:20,348
You Were about that big.

47
00:10:20,385 --> 00:10:22,376
Remember?

48
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,412
Not really.

49
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:29,157
So that's everything?

50
00:10:30,395 --> 00:10:32,386
Yeah.

51
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,456
Okay.

52
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:58,346
# Ifl could see#

53
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:02,486
# Beyond this moment #

54
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:07,966
# I'd hope to see you #

55
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,699
HoW long do I have to
give up my room?

56
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:18,574
Well, just until your father finishes
remodeling the den.

57
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,339
I'll be in college.

58
00:11:22,514 --> 00:11:23,674
They're here!

59
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:26,843
NoW remember,
calm and compassionate.

60
00:11:26,885 --> 00:11:28,682
No, Wen... Wendy.

61
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,957
Hi.

62
00:11:36,995 --> 00:11:39,429
She's an only child.

63
00:11:39,464 --> 00:11:41,625
- Hi!
- Hi.

64
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,396
- Do you like mice?
- No.

65
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:45,562
- How about snakes?
- No.

66
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:48,198
I can do a cartWheel.
Want to see?

67
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,368
Oh, Allison, look at you.

68
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,435
Oh.

69
00:11:53,478 --> 00:11:55,378
Mom, get out of the Way.

70
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,882
You didn't tell me
hoW pretty she is.

71
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,611
My side of the family.

72
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:01,744
- You must be starving.
- Not really.

73
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,379
Come on, Randy.

74
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:06,118
This dog is alWays

75
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,149
Come on in.

76
00:12:08,193 --> 00:12:11,287
- Hey, Dad, need some help?
- Yeah, I could use a hand.

77
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,525
Mom, Dad needs some help.

78
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:18,569
Do you really get up at 4:00
every morning?

79
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:20,504
When I'm in training, yeah.

80
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,234
Can't you use a treadmill?

81
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:23,935
Dad's got one.
He hangs his shirts on it.

82
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,637
Wendy.

83
00:12:25,677 --> 00:12:27,611
I run distance.

84
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,878
This is my room,

85
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,180
or Was my room.

86
00:12:33,218 --> 00:12:37,382
NoW you'll be sleeping here just until
Jonathan finishes remodeling the den.

87
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:39,413
You didn't have to do that.

88
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,587
Whiskers, hoW did you get out of there?

89
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,565
You naughty little boy.

00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,430
We'll be having supper

91
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:52,995
If you need anything,
just give a shout.

00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:56,735
This is your home too noW.

93
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:08,814
She's really taking it hard.

94
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:12,153
Well, What do you expect?

95
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,921
Her Whole life's been turned
upside doWn overnight.

96
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,227
Hey, Melissa,

97
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:26,260

I knoW. I have to take Jesse

101
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:37,280
How about Danielle?

102
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,841

What are you doing?

109
00:15:55,053 --> 00:15:57,112
Are you crazy?

110
00:15:57,155 --> 00:15:59,055
No. Ow. Ow.

111
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,321

Who's there?

118
00:17:52,203 --> 00:17:54,433
Hello?

119
00:17:54,472 --> 00:17:56,633

121
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,168
No, We're gonna get out of here.

122
00:18:02,213 --> 00:18:04,408
What day is it?

123
00:18:57,268 --> 00:19:00,005
Curiosity killed the cat.

124
00:19:35,106 --> 00:19:38,041
Whoa.

125
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:40,510
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

126
00:19:40,545 --> 00:19:42,308
They Wouldn't brake for the pope
on this road.

127
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,507
Yeah, I see that.

128
00:19:43,548 --> 00:19:45,175
Your-- your arm is bleeding.

129
00:19:45,216 --> 00:19:46,877
You Want to come inside?
You can Wash up.

130
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:48,408
It's nothing.

131
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,182
Oh shit.

132
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:52,951
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Yeah, it's just my leg.

133
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,788
You Want me to give you
a ride home?

134
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:57,454
No, it's okay, really.

135
00:19:57,495 --> 00:20:00,123
It's not a big deal,
just a couple miles up the street.

136
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:02,395
HoW do you knoW?

137
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:04,129
Small toWn.

138
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,966
Come on.
What are neighbors for?

139
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,700
A feW miles?
That's hardly neighbors.

140
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,867
Around here that's
a next-door neighbor.

141
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:14,638
Okay, sure.

142
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:16,579
All right, I'll be rightback.

143
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:35,292
Uh, I think I'm just gonna Walk.

144
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,595
Are you afraid?

145
00:20:36,634 --> 00:20:38,329
I'm not afraid.

146
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:40,894
Great.

147
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:42,964
Then get on.

148
00:20:47,278 --> 00:20:49,075
What's your name?

149
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,674
- Allison.
- William.

150
00:20:51,716 --> 00:20:53,445
SloW doWn.

151
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,612
I've never been on one
of these things before.

152
00:20:55,653 --> 00:20:59,111
After my accident the doctor said
I'd never ride again.

153
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,350
I'm kidding.

154
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,688
So Where are you from?

155
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,891
Chicago.

156
00:21:07,932 --> 00:21:10,162
I was there once.

157
00:21:10,201 --> 00:21:12,635
What brings you to this armpit?

158
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,138
I came to live With my uncle.

159
00:21:16,474 --> 00:21:18,806
A problem With the parents?

160
00:21:18,843 --> 00:21:20,868
Family issues?

161
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:23,278
Yeah.

162
00:21:23,314 --> 00:21:25,407
You too, huh?

163
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,850
What kind of problems?

164
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:32,419
They're dead.

165
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,923
Shit, I'm sorry.

166
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,019
Yeah.

167
00:21:38,062 --> 00:21:40,053
Me too.

168
00:21:55,146 --> 00:21:57,273
Thanks for the ride.

169
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,179
Keep it.

170
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:03,312
You need it.

171
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:21,205
Still no leads
in the disappearance

172
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:23,230
of college student Melissa Barnes
Who Was last seen

173
00:22:23,274 --> 00:22:25,868
Ieaving her place of employment
at the Charcoal Diner...

174
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:28,242
Hey, hoW Was your run?

175
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:30,304
Interesting.

176
00:22:45,296 --> 00:22:48,265
Melissa, l... I think

177
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:50,631
my hand is coming loose.

178
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,400
He's coming.
Don't make a sound.

179
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,968
We're gonna get out of here.

180
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:13,553
When steer are led
to slaughter,

181
00:23:13,591 --> 00:23:17,220
they smell the stench
of fear and blood

182
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:19,127
and they panic.

183
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:26,128
Sometimes We'd have to saW off
their hind legs

184
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:29,196
so they couldn't run.

185
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,175
No.

186
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:39,240
No, please.

187
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:43,085
No.

188
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:45,749
No. Oh God!

189
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,460
Hold her still.

190
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:56,091
Get back here.

191
00:24:12,116 --> 00:24:13,708
It's okay.

192
00:24:13,751 --> 00:24:15,878
Everything's under control.

193
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,117
Looks like I got here
just in time.

194
00:24:31,836 --> 00:24:34,771
When something outlasts
its usefulness,

195
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,172
it gets discarded.

196
00:25:29,827 --> 00:25:32,227
Still here?

197
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:50,212
- See you later.
- Yeah.

198
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:51,909
- Bye.
- Bye.

199
00:25:53,851 --> 00:25:55,819
Are you sure you're all right?

200
00:25:55,853 --> 00:25:58,720
Yeah, gotta get it over With
sooner or later.

201
00:25:58,756 --> 00:26:01,088
She'll be fine.

202
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:13,535
Nervous?

203
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,630
You think they'll have
a decent track team?

204
00:26:15,673 --> 00:26:18,836
Don't get your hopes up.

205
00:26:18,876 --> 00:26:20,639
No chance of that.

206
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:32,779
What is that place?

207
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,622
That's the Sutter plant.
It's been closed for years.

208
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,288
I saW someone there yesterday
While I Was jogging--

209
00:26:38,329 --> 00:26:40,194
a boy.

210
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:42,096
A boy?

211
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:44,033
Yeah, I thought so.

212
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:46,400
Probably just some kids
vandalizing the place.

213
00:26:46,437 --> 00:26:48,098
I kind of Wish
you'd stay aWay from there

214
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:50,801
and jog on the main road.

215
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:52,833
Yeah, and get hit by a truck.

216
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:55,641
Graham's a pack rat.
That place should be condemned.

217
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,671
Someone lives there?

218
00:26:57,715 --> 00:26:59,706
Yeah, he stays mostly
to himself.

219
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,843
You knoW him?

220
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:04,184
We're about the same age.

221
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,850
He never went to school.

222
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:09,917
His dad made him Work at that place
day and night.

223
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:14,557
It was a meat-packing plant

224
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:18,262
till they couldn't afford
to upgrade the equipment to code.

225
00:27:18,302 --> 00:27:21,806
I'll tell you one thing:
I don't miss the smell.

226
00:27:35,686 --> 00:27:37,677
I'll pick you up at 2:30.

227
00:28:10,888 --> 00:28:14,551
Silence is a sound

228
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:17,425
of no fear...

229
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:22,959
no pain...

230
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:28,194
the sound of peace.

231
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:55,296
I envy your serenity.

232
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,932
The path to redemption

233
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:08,139
begins With forgiveness--

234
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:10,613
absolution.

235
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,082
You're my Witness.

236
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,683
What did I tell you?

237
00:29:51,722 --> 00:29:53,713
I told you don't touch,
didn't l?

238
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:59,061
Yeah, the bolts are stripped.

239
00:29:59,096 --> 00:30:01,462
Cashier:
$17.50.

240
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:06,203
- Can I oWe you the 50 cents?
- Yeah, right.

241
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:07,795
Thanks, Eddie.

242
00:30:17,815 --> 00:30:19,942
Jonathan, hoW's that
extension coming?

243
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,679
It's going really good.

244
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:26,052
You knoW you've got
dryWall nails here?

245
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,284
Hmm?

246
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,384
Oh shit.

247
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:32,521
Just cheerleading.
Unless you can kick a field goal.

248
00:30:32,563 --> 00:30:34,087
That's it?

249
00:30:34,131 --> 00:30:37,157
There isn't much of a demand
for girls' sports in this area.

250
00:30:37,201 --> 00:30:39,795
Our cheerleading squad
did Win Best Routine

251
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:42,169
in the state final last year.

252
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:51,242
Come on! Whoo-hoo!

253
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:53,512
Yeah!

254
00:30:54,585 --> 00:30:56,246
Girl: Ready?

255
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:58,983
Let's shake it. Let's shout it.

256
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:03,954
Let's shake it.
Let's shout it.

257
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:08,697
Let's shake it.
Let's shout it.

258
00:32:17,134 --> 00:32:19,329
Aren't you scared of that falling
and crushing you?

259
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,669
HoW's your leg?

260
00:32:28,712 --> 00:32:32,079
Oh, it's better.

261
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:37,018
So this is What you do--

262
00:32:37,054 --> 00:32:39,386
fix cars?

263
00:32:39,423 --> 00:32:41,618
Guidance counselor told me
my aptitude tests said

264
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:45,425
either medical school
or auto mechanic.

265
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,829
I can't stand the sight of blood, so...

266
00:32:51,068 --> 00:32:54,560
Okay, Well,
I don't Want to bother you, so...

267
00:32:57,908 --> 00:33:00,001
Hey.

268
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,008
Yeah?

269
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:06,141
Are you busy later?

270
00:33:06,183 --> 00:33:08,947
Um, I Was gonna go home
and stare at the ceiling

271
00:33:08,986 --> 00:33:11,477
until I fell asleep. Why?

272
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:13,217
Well, I Was--

273
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:15,384
I Was Wondering if maybe
you Wanted to--

274
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:18,725
Billy!

275
00:33:18,762 --> 00:33:21,322
Excuse me.

276
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,691
- Billy!
- Dad?

277
00:33:24,735 --> 00:33:26,965
In here.

278
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:29,370
- Christ.
- God.

279
00:33:29,406 --> 00:33:32,603
I dropped the fucking remote.

280
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,076
be careful.

281
00:33:34,111 --> 00:33:35,942
- Jesus!
- Sorry, Dad.

282
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,811
- Oh man.
- You're dead Weight.

283
00:33:37,848 --> 00:33:40,214
Yeah, Well, I'm not dead yet.

284
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:42,685
- Oh.
- Can I help?

285
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,348
- Father: Just-- just lift me up.
- Yeah, just hold his chair.

286
00:33:45,389 --> 00:33:47,220
- Okay.
- Come on, just put me back on my chair.

287
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:49,624
You got it.

288
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,858
Here.

289
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:56,059
- Okay.
- You could have hurt yourself.

290
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,091
What do you mean,
could have?

291
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:02,769
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

292
00:34:02,806 --> 00:34:06,003
Um, Dad, this is Allison.

293
00:34:06,043 --> 00:34:08,477
Allison,this is mydad.

294
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,173
- Hi.
- She's from Chicago.

295
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,442
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

296
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:13,109
- From Chicago?
- Yeah.

297
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:15,482
I hate Chicago.

298
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:20,955
- Hey, at least you're not gay, right?
- Dad.

299
00:34:20,991 --> 00:34:24,085
You knoW, he spends most of the time
alone in his room,

300
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:27,427
- doing Who knoWs What.
- Yeah, you should talk.

301
00:34:27,464 --> 00:34:29,455
Yeah, but it's about the only thing
I've got left.

302
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,764
Um, I should probably go.

303
00:34:31,802 --> 00:34:33,360
No, stay.

304
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,133
No, it's getting late.
I really have to get home.

305
00:34:35,172 --> 00:34:37,163
He's not normally like this.

306
00:34:37,207 --> 00:34:39,198
He's usually much Worse.

307
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:42,110
Well, maybe you should give him
the helmet.

308
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:43,511
Bye.

309
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:48,948
What the hell
is the matter With you?

310
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:50,886
Can't she take a joke?

311
00:34:50,921 --> 00:34:52,286
Hey, come on.

312
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:54,587
Hey, toss me my cigarettes.

313
00:34:57,628 --> 00:35:00,791
Hey, What--?
NoW What am I supposed to do?

314
00:35:59,723 --> 00:36:01,748
What's your name?

315
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:06,055
Hello?

316
00:36:06,096 --> 00:36:09,088
Can you ansWer me, please?

317
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,834
Graham:
If they have no feelings,

318
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,304
they can't knoW fear.

319
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:24,073
But if they can't knoW fear...

320
00:36:26,283 --> 00:36:28,877
Why do they run?

321
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:30,546
Let me go.

322
00:36:32,556 --> 00:36:33,716
All clean?

323
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:37,683
Come here.

324
00:36:55,312 --> 00:36:57,303
What are you doing?

325
00:37:03,954 --> 00:37:05,945
Give me your arm.

326
00:37:06,957 --> 00:37:08,891
Don't.

327
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:11,451
Run!

328
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:13,656
He doesn't understand.
Can't you see?

329
00:37:13,697 --> 00:37:17,098
Stop it. Stop it!

330
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:22,361
His conscience is unburdened.

331
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,033
You're crazy!

332
00:37:24,074 --> 00:37:26,065
Is yours?

333
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,510
Let me go!
You're fucking crazy!

334
00:37:28,545 --> 00:37:30,979
Let me go!

335
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,443
Oh God.

336
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:50,690
Where Were you?

337
00:37:50,734 --> 00:37:52,634
Um, I'm sorry.

338
00:37:52,669 --> 00:37:54,500
You're sorry?

339
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:56,369
Jonathan.

340
00:37:56,406 --> 00:37:58,067
I thought We said 2:30.

341
00:37:58,108 --> 00:37:59,507
I left early.

342
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:01,443
We Were beginning to Worry.

343
00:38:01,478 --> 00:38:04,140
Well, I said I'm sorry.

344
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:06,809
Let's not make it a habit.

345
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:08,977
- Okay?
- Okay.

346
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:12,554
You've been to Paris?

347
00:38:12,589 --> 00:38:13,988
Yeah, a feW times.

348
00:38:14,024 --> 00:38:16,288
WoW, you've been to so many
cool places.

349
00:38:16,326 --> 00:38:19,420
Yeah, my dad used to turn
all of his business trips

350
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,829
into family vacations.

351
00:38:21,865 --> 00:38:24,698
He Was great like that.

352
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,566
I've never been anyWhere.

353
00:38:26,603 --> 00:38:29,970
Well, maybe someday you can go
to Chicago With me.

354
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:33,033
- Tomorrow?
- No.

355
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:38,340
Hi guys. Wendy.

356
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:40,577
Can I borroW your camera?

357
00:38:40,617 --> 00:38:42,608
Yeah, there's a feW
more pictures left.

358
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,917
You can finish the roll
if you Want.

359
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:47,685
Dad, can We go to France?

360
00:38:47,724 --> 00:38:49,715
Sure. I'll cash in
some stock options.

361
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,250
See What I mean?

362
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:53,729
HoW about Pittsburgh, huh?

363
00:38:54,731 --> 00:38:57,063
Wendy: HoW much longer
do I have to give up my room?

364
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,761
Jonathan:
Not much longer.

365
00:38:58,802 --> 00:39:01,965
Wendy: Don't you think
Whiskers needs a bigger cage?

366
00:39:02,005 --> 00:39:04,269
Jonathan:
I think that cage is just fine.

367
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:06,538
Do you think
Allison's happy here?

368
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:08,545
I hope so.

369
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:11,707
I don't think she likes me.

370
00:39:11,748 --> 00:39:14,911
HoW could somebody
not like you?

371
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:17,216
- I knoW, right?
- Right.

372
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,780
You knoW, I'm-- l-- l--

373
00:39:20,824 --> 00:39:22,815
I'm feeling--
feeling something.

374
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,795
I'm feeling a little--
I'm feeling a little hungry.

375
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:27,023
Oh no.

376
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:30,227
I need a pilloW sandWich.

377
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:48,908
Hello.

378
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,885
Can you talk?

379
00:39:53,423 --> 00:39:55,857
I can help you.

380
00:39:56,927 --> 00:40:00,693
You've just got to help me
get loose first.

381
00:40:07,437 --> 00:40:09,200
Please.

382
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:10,934
Help me.

383
00:40:45,909 --> 00:40:48,207
I've done everything
you've asked me.

384
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:58,212
You could make it stop.

385
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:34,213
God damn it!

386
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,379
NoW they can't trust you.

387
00:44:12,782 --> 00:44:15,376
You're gonna have to
make it up to them somehoW.

388
00:44:16,386 --> 00:44:19,219
They take advantage

389
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:22,350
of vulnerability
and Weakness.

390
00:44:22,392 --> 00:44:24,519
Bury it.

391
00:44:33,069 --> 00:44:35,503
The furnace needs scrubbing.

392
00:44:56,593 --> 00:44:58,891
Graham:
You caused all this.

393
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:51,641
Be good, sWeetie.

394
00:45:51,681 --> 00:45:53,342
I will.

395
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:01,723
Whiskers, no.

396
00:46:03,526 --> 00:46:06,495
Theories on our
emotional development

397
00:46:06,529 --> 00:46:08,793
are divided into
tWo schools of thought--

398
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:11,096
Whether We're products
of genetics

399
00:46:11,134 --> 00:46:13,898
predisposed to exhibit
certain behavioral patterns,

400
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,802
or products
of our environment.

401
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,467
Evolutionary biologists believe

402
00:46:18,508 --> 00:46:20,499
that our inherited genes

403
00:46:20,543 --> 00:46:22,807
are What determine
development.

404
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:25,713
Opponents argue
that our individuality

405
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:28,684
is directly influenced
by the patterns of behavior

406
00:46:28,718 --> 00:46:31,710
that We see and hear
every day.

407
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:33,746
In other Words,

408
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:35,781
a child raised
in a loving environment

409
00:46:35,825 --> 00:46:38,919
Will respond to the World
in a much different Way

410
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:42,022
than a child raised in fear
or taught to hate.

411
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:45,899
Our children are in essence
mirror images of ourselves--

412
00:46:45,935 --> 00:46:48,495
our beliefs, our ideologies,

413
00:46:48,538 --> 00:46:50,938
our conscience--

414
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,772
ground control to Major Tom--

415
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:55,801
Which brings us
to psychotherapy--

416
00:46:55,845 --> 00:46:58,905
the psychoanalytic theory
of personality.

417
00:46:58,948 --> 00:47:01,508
This Will be on the test, people.

418
00:47:42,992 --> 00:47:44,857
Hey, need a ride?

419
00:47:44,894 --> 00:47:46,384
Uh, I don't knoW.

420
00:47:46,429 --> 00:47:47,828
Come on, get in.

421
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:50,332
Take a break.
Have some fun.

422
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:57,134
Are you starting
your oWn pharmacy?

423
00:47:57,173 --> 00:47:59,232
I get headaches.

424
00:47:59,275 --> 00:48:01,038
I can't stay out late.

425
00:48:01,077 --> 00:48:03,841
Don't Worry.
I'll have you back by Monday.

426
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,041
Yeah, I restored it piece by piece.

427
00:48:06,082 --> 00:48:08,676
I thought about opening my oWn
body shop one day, but...

428
00:48:08,718 --> 00:48:11,152
Why don't you?

429
00:48:11,187 --> 00:48:14,816
Um, Well, my dad--
he's not so good on his oWn.

430
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:17,452
So hoW far do you run anyWay?

431
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:20,793
Five, six miles.

432
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:23,355
I would have a heart attack.

433
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,492
Yeah.

434
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:26,434
These Will give you
a heart attack.

435
00:48:28,271 --> 00:48:30,762
I guess you never eat
junk like this, huh?

436
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:33,503
I'm not in training right noW.

437
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:35,340
Yeah, me neither.

438
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:57,429
So do you have any
brothers or sisters?

439
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:59,833
Just me and my dad.

440
00:48:59,869 --> 00:49:01,928
My mom died
a couple of years ago--

441
00:49:01,971 --> 00:49:04,201
pneumonia.

442
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,640
Has he alWays been, um--?

443
00:49:06,676 --> 00:49:09,167
Yeah, he used to Work
construction.

444
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:12,545
He lost the use of his legs
in an accident

445
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:15,016
in Chicago, actually.

446
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:21,016
My father alWays Wanted a boy.

447
00:49:23,092 --> 00:49:26,459
He was a track star

448
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:31,365
and just missed qualifying
for the Olympics in '76.

449
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:35,360
He tried to correct
that failure through me.

450
00:49:38,107 --> 00:49:40,098
They Were driving home
from dinner

451
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,941
just a mile from the house and...

452
00:49:47,283 --> 00:49:49,376
an bleW a stop sign.

453
00:49:51,754 --> 00:49:53,949
It's funny

454
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:57,653
hoW everything can change
in an instant.

455
00:49:57,694 --> 00:49:59,685
A stranger can come along

456
00:49:59,729 --> 00:50:04,029
and in the blink of an eye just

457
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:07,525
destroy everything.

458
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:10,539
So you came to live
With your uncle?

459
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:16,069
I have a grandmother

460
00:50:16,112 --> 00:50:20,310
Who lives in NeW York,
but she's agoraphobic,

461
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,818
a real freak shoW, so...

462
00:50:24,387 --> 00:50:26,252
it Was her or my uncle.

463
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:29,258
I bet you Wish
you Went to NeW York noW, huh?

464
00:50:32,495 --> 00:50:34,520
I hate New York.

465
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,247
Out of the car, Allison.

466
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:37,316
- What?
- You heard me.

467
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,625
- I'm not going anyWhere.
- Yeah, back off, man.

468
00:51:40,663 --> 00:51:43,325
You shut your mouth!
Come on.

469
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:46,802
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking you home.

470
00:51:46,836 --> 00:51:48,030
Allison

471
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,332
Your mother and father Worked hard
so you could be somebody.

472
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:56,812
I'm not gonna let you derail that
by hanging out With that trailer trash.

473
00:51:56,846 --> 00:51:58,837
You don't even knoW him.

474
00:51:58,881 --> 00:52:01,816
I knoW that kid better than you
ever Will. If your father Was here--

475
00:52:01,851 --> 00:52:04,285
Look, sports, college--
that Whole thing--

476
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,379
that Was my father's dream,
not mine.

477
00:52:06,422 --> 00:52:08,413
I never Wanted any of it.

478
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,926
Well, What do you Want? Do you Want
to live in the back of a truck?

479
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,484
Do you Want to collect Welfare?

480
00:52:12,528 --> 00:52:14,519
You think
I Wanted to come here?

481
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:17,624
You think I Wanted
to come and live With you?

482
00:52:25,274 --> 00:52:27,674
My brother and l
made a promise

483
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:30,110
a long time ago:

484
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:33,081
Should something happen
to either of us,

485
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:35,448
We'd be there
for each other's kids.

486
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:41,646
It's not one you ever expect
to have to keep,

487
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:45,218
and I'm not going back
on my Word,

488
00:52:45,261 --> 00:52:48,230
but it's your life.

489
00:52:48,264 --> 00:52:50,562
You Want to try it out
on your oWn,

490
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,932
go ahead.

491
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:56,728
You Want me to get out?

492
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:59,298
I Want you to make a choice.

493
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:10,408
Okay, Well, We'll do things
my Way for a While,

494
00:53:10,453 --> 00:53:14,082
just as long as We understand
each other.

495
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:02,696
Oh no.

496
00:54:11,647 --> 00:54:14,673
No.

497
00:54:14,717 --> 00:54:18,414
I haven't done anything.
I haven't done anything.

498
00:54:18,454 --> 00:54:20,513
Please.

499
00:54:20,556 --> 00:54:22,990
Graham:
Like I shoWed you.

500
00:54:23,025 --> 00:54:25,755
Why are you doing this?

501
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:28,855
HoW frightening
When it's our oWn flesh.

502
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:31,298
No!

503
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:32,892
No, stop.

504
00:54:32,935 --> 00:54:34,300
Hold her still.

505
00:54:34,337 --> 00:54:36,931
No.

506
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:38,736
- Graham: Do it!
- Please, please.

507
00:54:40,042 --> 00:54:41,942
- I don't think your heart's in this.
- No. No.

508
00:55:09,338 --> 00:55:13,206
Come on.
Come on.

509
00:55:13,242 --> 00:55:15,642
I'm not afraid
of you anymore.

510
00:55:15,678 --> 00:55:18,078
This is my house.

511
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:20,514
I'm not gonna be like you--
condemned.

512
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:23,110
I'm fixing What you broke!

513
00:55:23,152 --> 00:55:26,087
Go back to hell
Where your bed is made.

514
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:28,818
This is my house!

515
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:23,171
- My dad trusted me.
- Jonathan Will too.

516
00:56:23,212 --> 00:56:25,544
You just have to
give him a chance.

517
00:56:25,581 --> 00:56:27,913
Besides, it's not you
he doesn't trust.

518
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:29,679
I can take care of myself.

519
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,550
I knoW you can.

520
00:56:31,587 --> 00:56:33,748
He's just trying
to look out for you.

521
00:56:33,789 --> 00:56:35,916
Please.

522
00:56:41,264 --> 00:56:43,789
What's he got
against William anyWay?

523
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:47,564
Oh, We've knoWn Billy
since he Was this high.

524
00:56:47,603 --> 00:56:50,970
He's had to deal With more
than his share of problems.

525
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:52,998
That's not his fault.

526
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:56,273
I mean, I think it's Wonderful
hoW he takes care of his father,

527
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:59,543
especially after What happened
to his mother.

528
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:02,847
Well, she did that to herself.

529
00:57:02,885 --> 00:57:05,217
You can't give yourself
pneumonia.

530
00:57:06,889 --> 00:57:09,221
She didn't die of pneumonia.

531
00:57:09,258 --> 00:57:13,854
Billy's mother--
she killed herself.

532
00:57:13,896 --> 00:57:16,592
What?

533
00:57:16,632 --> 00:57:20,261
Hung herself in the garage.

534
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:27,567
Billy Was the one
Who found her.

535
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,477
It Was really hard on him.

536
00:57:30,513 --> 00:57:33,482
The doctors put him
on all sorts of medication.

537
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:36,815
He's gotten in a lot of trouble
around toWn.

538
00:57:36,852 --> 00:57:40,117
I think Jonathan's just afraid
he's a little unstable.

539
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:42,818
And hisfather--well--

540
00:57:42,858 --> 00:57:44,348
Where are you going?

541
00:57:44,393 --> 00:57:46,520
I need to sort things out
in my head.

542
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:50,522
Hey, Allison,
you Want to play a game?

543
00:57:50,566 --> 00:57:52,557
Maybe later, okay?

544
00:57:52,601 --> 00:57:55,069
Where are you going?

545
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,167
Hello?

546
00:58:36,712 --> 00:58:38,907
No, Wait.

547
00:59:59,161 --> 01:00:01,186
Hello?

548
01:00:20,015 --> 01:00:22,984
Hey, are you okay?

549
01:00:24,019 --> 01:00:26,010
Wait.

550
01:00:52,381 --> 01:00:54,872
Are you okay?

551
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:58,177
Are you in trouble?

552
01:01:14,436 --> 01:01:16,461
What are you doing doWn here?

553
01:01:25,548 --> 01:01:27,413
Are you in here?

554
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:52,437
Oh my God.

555
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:40,917
Martin.

556
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,529
Where are you?

557
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:05,872
Wait. Come back.

558
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:21,754
I'm not going to hurt you.

559
01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:23,417
I want to help you.

560
01:04:27,429 --> 01:04:29,090
Is your name Martin?

561
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:32,761
Here, come With me.

562
01:04:32,801 --> 01:04:36,396
You can't stay here.
It's not safe.

563
01:04:36,438 --> 01:04:38,599
What's Wrong?

564
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,734
You don't have to be afraid.

565
01:04:41,777 --> 01:04:43,768
You can trust me.

566
01:04:43,812 --> 01:04:45,677
You shouldn't be doWn here.

567
01:04:45,714 --> 01:04:49,775
No! No!

568
01:04:49,818 --> 01:04:52,912
No! No! No!

569
01:05:03,665 --> 01:05:06,463
Good Work.

570
01:05:12,374 --> 01:05:14,706
- I'm sure she's fine.
- How?

571
01:05:14,743 --> 01:05:17,143
She's just bloWing off
some steam.

572
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:19,909
No 17-year-old Wants to be told
What to do.

573
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:26,545
Not yet.

574
01:05:26,588 --> 01:05:29,751
I don't have any brothers or sisters
'cause Dad's lazy.

575
01:05:29,792 --> 01:05:32,727
And noW he's
chased her aWay too.

576
01:05:32,761 --> 01:05:34,729
Way to go, Dad.

577
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:33,045
She never came home
last night.

578
01:06:33,088 --> 01:06:36,023
I know.

579
01:06:36,058 --> 01:06:37,218
Where are you going?

580
01:06:37,259 --> 01:06:40,092
I'm gonna go find her.

581
01:06:45,133 --> 01:06:46,896
I need to speak to Allison.

582
01:06:46,935 --> 01:06:48,300
She's not here.

583
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:50,532
It's important.

584
01:06:50,572 --> 01:06:53,564
- She isn't here, Billy.
- We thought she Was With you.

585
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:56,009
No. She's been gone all night?

586
01:06:56,044 --> 01:06:57,534
Since yesterday.

587
01:06:57,579 --> 01:06:59,513
This is your goddamn fault.

588
01:06:59,548 --> 01:07:02,517
- Stop. Jonathan.
- Stay the hell aWay from her.

589
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:03,711
- Jonathan.
- Don't push me.

590
01:07:03,752 --> 01:07:05,982
- Jonathan.
- You're no good.

591
01:07:06,021 --> 01:07:07,886
You're just like your old man

592
01:07:07,923 --> 01:07:09,652
good for nothing.

593
01:07:09,691 --> 01:07:12,251
It's okay.

594
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:14,922
Stay aWay from my niece!

595
01:07:14,963 --> 01:07:17,397
Come on.
Are you all right?

596
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:43,483
Please.

597
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:47,386
If they have no feelings,

598
01:08:47,422 --> 01:08:49,856
they can't knoW fear.

599
01:08:51,893 --> 01:08:54,691
But if they can't knoW fear...

600
01:08:57,132 --> 01:08:59,532
then Why do they run?

601
01:09:13,615 --> 01:09:15,981
Anybody home?

602
01:09:20,889 --> 01:09:22,413
Please don't.

603
01:09:28,530 --> 01:09:29,929
Sutter!

604
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:32,295
Uncle J!

605
01:09:58,126 --> 01:10:00,754
Hello?

606
01:10:10,105 --> 01:10:12,539
Who's there?

607
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:15,669
It's Jonathan Miller.

608
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:17,611
I'm looking for my niece.

609
01:10:17,646 --> 01:10:20,171
She didn't come home
last night.

610
01:10:20,215 --> 01:10:22,308
I've been looking
all over for her.

611
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:24,750
I thought she might have Wandered
over here. Have you seen her?

612
01:10:24,786 --> 01:10:26,549
No.

613
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:33,227
Listen, do you have a young boy
living over here?

614
01:10:33,261 --> 01:10:36,196
She said she saW a boy
running around over here.

615
01:10:36,231 --> 01:10:38,165
Just get off my property.

616
01:10:40,235 --> 01:10:41,725
You mind if I come in
a moment?

617
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:43,032
I'm busy.

618
01:10:43,071 --> 01:10:45,062
Just a moment.

619
01:10:46,108 --> 01:10:48,303
Just a second.

620
01:10:49,978 --> 01:10:51,969
Uncle J!

621
01:10:52,013 --> 01:10:54,072
Allison?

622
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:19,199
Uncle J!

623
01:11:24,012 --> 01:11:26,003
What did you do?

624
01:11:26,047 --> 01:11:28,538
You girls, you--

625
01:11:28,583 --> 01:11:31,347
you never can keep
your mouths shut.

626
01:11:37,092 --> 01:11:39,083
No! No!

627
01:11:39,127 --> 01:11:42,893
No. No.

628
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:52,436
No. No.

629
01:12:00,749 --> 01:12:03,115
No!

630
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:07,049
No.

631
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:12,358
Leave me alone!

632
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:32,330
Hello?

633
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:37,645
Allison?

634
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:40,079
Mr. Miller?

635
01:14:08,076 --> 01:14:10,476
Hello?

636
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,055
Allison?

637
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:59,055
Oh my God. Martin!

638
01:15:00,595 --> 01:15:01,994
Help me!

639
01:15:03,798 --> 01:15:06,130
Open the door. Hurry.

640
01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:10,762
Come back. Help.

641
01:15:13,608 --> 01:15:17,009
Let me out, Martin.

642
01:15:17,045 --> 01:15:19,343
Allison?

643
01:15:25,453 --> 01:15:27,478
Hello.

644
01:15:49,411 --> 01:15:50,969
Allison.

645
01:15:52,814 --> 01:15:56,045
Can she?
Allison.

646
01:15:56,084 --> 01:15:57,278
I can't hear you.

647
01:15:57,318 --> 01:15:59,843
William, open the door.

648
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:02,550
- It's locked.
- Hurry.

649
01:16:12,267 --> 01:16:13,791
I think it's coming loose.

650
01:16:15,336 --> 01:16:17,429
Turn around, please.

651
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:21,107
Turn around.

652
01:16:21,142 --> 01:16:24,111
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I promise. It's okay.

653
01:16:24,145 --> 01:16:26,306
I got it.

654
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:43,259
Stop!

655
01:17:34,482 --> 01:17:36,211
No.

656
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,852
Forget it.

657
01:17:44,859 --> 01:17:46,622
Leave me alone.

658
01:17:59,073 --> 01:18:01,473
I don't care.

659
01:18:01,509 --> 01:18:03,841
Let them find out.

660
01:18:29,604 --> 01:18:31,868
Forget it.

661
01:18:31,906 --> 01:18:33,396
I won't do it.

662
01:18:33,441 --> 01:18:35,841
I can't.

663
01:18:40,782 --> 01:18:43,580
You leave him alone.

664
01:18:43,618 --> 01:18:46,178
He hasn't done anything.

665
01:18:47,555 --> 01:18:49,819
No. No, I need him.

666
01:18:49,857 --> 01:18:52,917
Who-- Who-- Who's gonna
help me clean up?

667
01:18:54,762 --> 01:18:57,060
You knoW I can't stand it.

668
01:18:57,098 --> 01:18:59,896
No no no
no no no no.

669
01:18:59,934 --> 01:19:03,335
Shut up. Shut up!

670
01:19:03,371 --> 01:19:05,168
God!

671
01:19:05,206 --> 01:19:07,071
You're no better than he Was!

672
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:43,703
You promised me.

673
01:19:43,745 --> 01:19:46,179
I did everything you said.

674
01:20:07,201 --> 01:20:09,533
You Win.

675
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:24,516
You're Wrong.

676
01:20:24,552 --> 01:20:26,850
He wouldn't dare.

677
01:20:56,951 --> 01:20:59,852
Don't look at me like that.

678
01:20:59,887 --> 01:21:01,718
You don't ask Why.

679
01:21:01,756 --> 01:21:04,452
You just do.

680
01:21:04,492 --> 01:21:06,790
That's just the Way it is.

681
01:21:09,997 --> 01:21:13,194
You think you oWe me,

682
01:21:13,234 --> 01:21:17,295
think maybe I should groW eyes
in the back of my head?

683
01:21:17,338 --> 01:21:19,966
They abandoned you.

684
01:21:22,276 --> 01:21:24,710
What Would you be
Without me?

685
01:21:27,482 --> 01:21:29,473
You feel guilty or something?

686
01:21:29,517 --> 01:21:32,975
Don't feel guilty.

687
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:36,012
A child shouldn't feel guilty
about nothing.

688
01:21:45,099 --> 01:21:47,567
You--

689
01:21:47,602 --> 01:21:50,935
you don't feel anything, do you--

690
01:21:50,972 --> 01:21:53,634
guilt, pain, regret--

691
01:21:53,674 --> 01:21:57,770
nothing? Do you?

692
01:21:57,812 --> 01:22:01,077
Who are you to judge me?

693
01:22:14,762 --> 01:22:17,128
You have no soul to redeem.

694
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:21,359
Do you?

695
01:22:30,511 --> 01:22:32,877
Don't try anything funny
While I'm gone.

696
01:22:32,914 --> 01:22:35,314
They're Watching.

697
01:24:47,548 --> 01:24:49,539
Oh my God.

698
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:51,643
What did he do to you?

699
01:24:51,686 --> 01:24:54,348
Come on. I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

700
01:24:54,388 --> 01:24:55,719
I'm sorry.

701
01:25:09,904 --> 01:25:11,929
Are you okay?

702
01:25:13,307 --> 01:25:15,298
Come on.

703
01:25:17,144 --> 01:25:20,045
Come on. It's okay.
Trust me, okay?

704
01:25:31,859 --> 01:25:34,885
Come on, I can't carry you.

705
01:25:36,497 --> 01:25:39,261
Is this What you're scared of?

706
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:42,929
This thing?

707
01:25:44,405 --> 01:25:46,839
You see? It's nothing.

708
01:25:58,953 --> 01:26:00,944
When are they coming home?

709
01:26:00,988 --> 01:26:02,478
Soon.

710
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,890
Finally.

711
01:27:01,048 --> 01:27:03,312
Yes?

712
01:27:04,318 --> 01:27:06,980
Wendy, run.

713
01:27:07,021 --> 01:27:09,819
Mommy!

714
01:27:12,593 --> 01:27:14,288
Mommy.

715
01:27:19,834 --> 01:27:22,928
- Mommy!
- Wendy, run.

716
01:27:22,970 --> 01:27:24,198
Run!

717
01:27:35,149 --> 01:27:36,309
No, please don't.

718
01:27:36,350 --> 01:27:37,977
I have to.

719
01:27:46,794 --> 01:27:49,194
We're almost there, okay?

720
01:28:10,785 --> 01:28:12,776
Jonathan.

721
01:28:39,046 --> 01:28:40,536
No.

722
01:28:52,359 --> 01:28:55,385
It's gonna be okay.

723
01:28:55,429 --> 01:28:57,021
Okay?

724
01:28:57,064 --> 01:28:58,964
I'm gonna get you home.

725
01:29:14,782 --> 01:29:17,012
Randy. Oh Randy.

726
01:29:33,267 --> 01:29:35,462
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

727
01:29:43,644 --> 01:29:47,341
Please don't hurt my animals.

728
01:29:53,487 --> 01:29:54,784
No.

729
01:30:10,704 --> 01:30:13,104
Ate from my hand...

730
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:19,575
and trusted me

731
01:30:19,613 --> 01:30:22,173
even at the end.

732
01:30:24,351 --> 01:30:26,717
Unconditional.

733
01:30:26,754 --> 01:30:29,621
And he--he made me!

734
01:30:29,657 --> 01:30:30,885
Mommy!

735
01:30:39,566 --> 01:30:41,693
I'm making things right.

736
01:30:41,735 --> 01:30:44,203
I owe them that much.

737
01:30:45,773 --> 01:30:49,504
With each one

738
01:30:49,543 --> 01:30:51,670
another sin is forgiven.

739
01:30:51,712 --> 01:30:55,204
I can't let it happen again,

740
01:30:55,249 --> 01:30:56,739
not like me.

741
01:31:03,624 --> 01:31:07,390
You understand, don't you?

742
01:31:07,428 --> 01:31:10,864
Not like that boy-- Worthless.

743
01:31:14,802 --> 01:31:16,827
Karen!

744
01:31:19,940 --> 01:31:22,807
Karen.

745
01:31:22,843 --> 01:31:27,246
Don't let him get her.

746
01:31:32,219 --> 01:31:34,881
I can't stop now.

747
01:31:34,922 --> 01:31:37,482
There's still
so much more to do.

748
01:31:37,524 --> 01:31:39,287
You-- you come With me.

749
01:31:39,326 --> 01:31:40,850
Come With me.

750
01:31:42,429 --> 01:31:44,454
Please come with me.

751
01:31:44,498 --> 01:31:47,296
Help me.
Help me redeem myself!

752
01:31:47,334 --> 01:31:50,428
- No.
- Let her go, you son of a bitch!

753
01:31:57,478 --> 01:31:59,844
It does.

754
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:02,474
I'm sorry.

755
01:32:11,258 --> 01:32:13,249
It's okay.

756
01:32:13,293 --> 01:32:16,387
It's me.
It's just me, okay?

757
01:32:16,430 --> 01:32:18,227
Where is Mommy?

758
01:32:18,265 --> 01:32:19,755
She's doWnstairs.

759
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:28,065
I need you to stay here,
all right?

760
01:32:28,108 --> 01:32:29,268
Why?

761
01:32:29,309 --> 01:32:31,607
Just please do as I say.

762
01:32:31,645 --> 01:32:33,374
- Okay?
- Don't leave.

763
01:32:33,414 --> 01:32:35,939
I'm not leaving.
Just stay here.

764
01:32:50,531 --> 01:32:52,021
Martin!

765
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:08,575
Martin!

766
01:33:17,458 --> 01:33:19,449
911. What is your emergency?

767
01:33:19,493 --> 01:33:21,927
Yes, hello?

768
01:34:41,808 --> 01:34:43,935
Wendy: Allison?

769
01:35:40,367 --> 01:35:42,392
Boy!

770
01:36:30,984 --> 01:36:33,316
I understand now

771
01:36:33,353 --> 01:36:35,480
Why they run...

772
01:36:38,592 --> 01:36:40,822
that even a dumb animal

773
01:36:43,730 --> 01:36:46,358
knoWs When it's been betrayed.

774
01:36:57,744 --> 01:37:00,235
Do you feel betrayed?

775
01:37:03,283 --> 01:37:05,114
No.

776
01:37:05,152 --> 01:37:07,643
That's Why you didn't run.

777
01:37:07,688 --> 01:37:10,885
'Cause you kneW
you had it coming.

778
01:37:19,466 --> 01:37:23,129
You--

779
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:25,661
you never ran.

780
01:37:31,378 --> 01:37:33,243
My boy.

781
01:37:45,492 --> 01:37:47,824
Thank you.

782
01:38:40,714 --> 01:38:43,205
We counted four bodies.

783
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:45,241
Any idea What caused it?

784
01:38:45,285 --> 01:38:47,753
Tough to say--
a stove left on,

785
01:38:47,788 --> 01:38:50,120
a cigarette left burning.

786
01:38:50,157 --> 01:38:52,455
Probably got trapped,

787
01:38:52,492 --> 01:38:55,620
tried to call for help,
but flames consumed them.

788
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:08,701
Yeah.

789
01:39:30,363 --> 01:39:32,490
Father: Billy.

790
01:39:34,935 --> 01:39:37,369
Billy.

791
01:39:38,672 --> 01:39:40,162
Billy.

792
01:39:44,544 --> 01:39:47,012
Billy.

793
01:46:48,568 --> 01:46:51,002
Hello?

794
01:46:56,643 --> 01:46:58,668
Is anybody here?

795
01:47:01,614 --> 01:47:03,639
Can you help me?
