1
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:06,678
Damn it.

2
00:01:21,197 --> 00:01:23,901
What the goddamn?

3
00:01:27,705 --> 00:01:28,907
Shit.

4
00:01:34,715 --> 00:01:36,217
Anybody in there?

5
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:41,057
You a crashed astronaut
or somethin'?

6
00:01:47,098 --> 00:01:51,070
Whoever you are,
you blew up my truck!

7
00:01:51,102 --> 00:01:52,471
You gonna get me another truck,

8
00:01:52,505 --> 00:01:54,508
and I'm gonna run
your ass over with it.

9
00:02:02,784 --> 00:02:04,688
I didn't mean that.

10
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:11,062
We're good.

11
00:03:30,887 --> 00:03:34,991
<b>TERRORDACTYL</b>

12
00:03:36,273 --> 00:03:39,273
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

13
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:03,577
Dude.

14
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,447
Want to give me a hand?

15
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,250
Jonas, how long do you think

16
00:04:07,282 --> 00:04:09,384
I can keep doing
this job by myself?

17
00:04:09,418 --> 00:04:10,487
Dude, I'm taking my break.

18
00:04:11,687 --> 00:04:13,323
I was mowing.

19
00:04:13,356 --> 00:04:14,526
Yeah, mowing what?

20
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:16,262
The lawn.

21
00:04:16,294 --> 00:04:17,295
With what?

22
00:04:19,364 --> 00:04:20,867
Where's my lawn mower?

23
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,637
Relax.
It's right over there.

24
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:27,409
God damn it.

25
00:04:27,441 --> 00:04:29,612
Thought I finally got it
working this time.

26
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,319
You know, I probably

27
00:04:35,352 --> 00:04:36,487
just need to change
something here.

28
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:38,858
Break's over.

29
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:42,195
Man, thought
I had it this time.

30
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:58,549
You know, if you spent
half as much time on real work

31
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:01,321
as you do with your things,

32
00:05:01,353 --> 00:05:02,555
you might actually make
some good money.

33
00:05:02,587 --> 00:05:03,790
Just saying.

34
00:05:03,823 --> 00:05:06,228
Lars, you've got
a business degree

35
00:05:06,261 --> 00:05:07,796
and you're planting shrubs
all day.

36
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:09,998
Well, I mean, shrubs
don't crash on my couch

37
00:05:10,032 --> 00:05:11,601
for months on end,

38
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:13,536
shrubs don't beg me
for a job after college,

39
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:15,940
and shrubs definitely
don't drink all my beer.

40
00:05:15,973 --> 00:05:17,408
I like shrubs.

41
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,578
Well, shrubs don't drive you home
after a long night at the bar,

42
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,014
they don't help you get over
your latest and greatest breakup,

43
00:05:22,048 --> 00:05:24,617
and they don't fix your truck
for you when it's not working.

44
00:05:24,651 --> 00:05:25,986
All right, fine,
you got me there.

45
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,391
All right, cool.
Fertilizer time!

46
00:06:16,653 --> 00:06:19,490
So I know that was my shovel,

47
00:06:19,522 --> 00:06:21,627
but, what is it now?

48
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,927
-Dude, this?
-Yeah.

49
00:06:22,961 --> 00:06:24,430
This is my shov-brella.

50
00:06:27,532 --> 00:06:30,403
Check it out.

51
00:06:32,574 --> 00:06:35,312
Stay the hell away
from my leaf blower.

52
00:06:38,882 --> 00:06:41,118
Hey, so, five o'clock.

53
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:43,021
Happy hour at the old
Watering Hole?

54
00:06:43,054 --> 00:06:46,492
No, dude, I just want to have a
few beers and pass out on my couch.

55
00:06:46,525 --> 00:06:47,728
But it's friday night.

56
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,428
We always go out on
friday night.

57
00:06:49,462 --> 00:06:50,732
Yeah, well, I want to try
something different,

58
00:06:50,765 --> 00:06:52,600
like sleeping.

59
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:54,603
Yeah.
Yeah, you're probably right.

60
00:06:54,635 --> 00:06:56,638
You know, you're probably
getting too old

61
00:06:56,672 --> 00:06:58,374
for that kind
of stuff anyway.

62
00:06:59,675 --> 00:07:00,745
Fine.

63
00:07:00,778 --> 00:07:03,815
But you're buying and driving.

64
00:07:03,847 --> 00:07:05,617
Deal.

65
00:07:40,964 --> 00:07:43,133
Wait till you see
my latest catch.

66
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:46,905
Biggest, baddest, meanest river
son of a bitch you've ever seen.

67
00:07:47,937 --> 00:07:48,139
Evenin', Sampson.

68
00:07:48,173 --> 00:07:49,810
Don't you "evenin'" me, sonny.

69
00:07:49,842 --> 00:07:50,977
I'm a marine.

70
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,647
This ain't just any evenin'.

71
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,483
This is a goddamn celebration.

72
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,885
And what'd you shoot this time?

73
00:07:56,917 --> 00:07:58,085
Shark!

74
00:07:58,118 --> 00:07:59,922
Right there in the river.

75
00:07:59,956 --> 00:08:03,126
It was much tougher than that
grizzly that I shot up in the Yukon.

76
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:06,797
And he had me in his jaws
most of the time.

77
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:09,168
Yeah, and what river
would this be?

78
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,571
The L.A. River,
you damn civvy!

79
00:08:11,604 --> 00:08:13,172
Put ten slugs in him.

80
00:08:13,205 --> 00:08:16,144
Tired him out
till he went belly up.

81
00:08:16,177 --> 00:08:18,547
Just like the women in my bed.

82
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,884
You know, one day, Sampson,
you're gonna sober up

83
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,653
and hopefully not be
such a scumbag?

84
00:08:23,686 --> 00:08:25,757
Yeah, sad day that'll be.

85
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,630
Nuts.

86
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:34,168
Dude, I got to be honest.
I hate this place.

87
00:08:34,201 --> 00:08:35,803
What? I love it.

88
00:08:35,836 --> 00:08:37,239
I mean, the seats
are old as hell.

89
00:08:37,271 --> 00:08:39,241
The beer tastes like
it came out of the faucet.

90
00:08:39,274 --> 00:08:40,576
Come on.

91
00:08:40,608 --> 00:08:41,944
I don't even want to think

92
00:08:41,977 --> 00:08:43,513
about what these stains are
on this table.

93
00:08:43,547 --> 00:08:44,947
Dude, they wipe off.

94
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,217
And that smell
is absolutely disgusting.

95
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,086
Tell me what there is
to like about this place.

96
00:08:49,121 --> 00:08:50,756
Besides the obvious.

97
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:51,756
What can I get you boys?

98
00:08:51,789 --> 00:08:52,691
How you doing, Candice?

99
00:08:52,724 --> 00:08:53,627
Hey, Lars, how are you?

100
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,627
Hard day on the job?

101
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,662
Yes, ma'am. That it was.

102
00:08:55,695 --> 00:08:57,230
What about you, Jonas?

103
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:00,268
Well, I'm doing okay.

104
00:09:00,302 --> 00:09:03,273
You know, hardest day of
work ever, with, the...

105
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,110
The sun.

106
00:09:06,142 --> 00:09:08,679
And we had the dirt and
the shovel and the shrub,

107
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:11,617
and, you know, we got sweaty
with the work, and so...

108
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:13,018
Yeah.

109
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:15,121
Yeah, you're still sweating.

110
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,156
Well, you know me.
I'm always sweating.

111
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,094
Working! I'm always work...
Always working.

112
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,097
So, how are you?

113
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,733
'Cause it looks
a little slow tonight here.

114
00:09:23,766 --> 00:09:24,834
-You okay?
-Yeah.

115
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:27,003
Everything slow?
Everything okay?

116
00:09:27,037 --> 00:09:29,007
Yeah, it's a slow one.

117
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:31,944
What can I get you guys?

118
00:09:31,976 --> 00:09:33,145
Two IPAs, please.

119
00:09:33,178 --> 00:09:34,947
All right,
coming right up.

120
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:36,951
-Man.
-Bro.

121
00:09:36,983 --> 00:09:39,285
-That was magic.
-Yeah?

122
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:42,022
I could feel the sparks
coming off that.

123
00:09:42,055 --> 00:09:44,292
I think she's really
starting to dig you.

124
00:09:44,325 --> 00:09:45,928
Really, you think?

125
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,630
The signs were all there.
I mean, think about it.

126
00:09:47,663 --> 00:09:49,000
When you started talking
about how much

127
00:09:49,033 --> 00:09:52,004
you sweat
and the shrubs you plant...

128
00:09:52,036 --> 00:09:54,305
come on, man,
why didn't you propose?

129
00:09:54,338 --> 00:09:55,941
Yeah, I'm a gentleman, okay?

130
00:09:55,974 --> 00:09:58,110
Take my time,
picking my moment,

131
00:09:58,143 --> 00:09:59,179
getting to know her a bit.

132
00:09:59,212 --> 00:10:00,780
Dude, you do know her.

133
00:10:00,813 --> 00:10:02,350
We come here
every friday night,

134
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:04,953
and every friday night,
it's the same thing with you.

135
00:10:04,986 --> 00:10:09,993
You sit there, and you stutter, and you
get all jittery like a little teenager.

136
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,896
No, don't eat that!

137
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:13,198
Disgusting.

138
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,332
Just ask her out.

139
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:15,867
I'm working on it.

140
00:10:15,901 --> 00:10:17,237
Bro, if you don't say something,

141
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:18,904
she's gonna end up
with that drunk Sampson.

142
00:10:24,246 --> 00:10:26,415
It ain't that hard, Jonas.

143
00:10:26,448 --> 00:10:29,219
Guess your balls just aren't
as big as that brain of yours?

144
00:10:29,252 --> 00:10:30,988
Lars, have you
looked at us lately?

145
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,892
Come on, man, I'm dirty and
sweaty and, let's see, poor too.

146
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,261
I mean, I can't
ask her out like this.

147
00:10:36,294 --> 00:10:37,829
I don't even have
a dollar to my name.

148
00:10:37,862 --> 00:10:39,432
It ain't respectable.

149
00:10:39,465 --> 00:10:42,101
Hard honest work,
that's respectable, Jonas.

150
00:10:42,135 --> 00:10:44,105
Why, because it's hard?
I mean, come on, man.

151
00:10:44,138 --> 00:10:46,042
There's got to be
a better way of making money

152
00:10:46,075 --> 00:10:48,210
than sweating our asses off
in rich pricks' lawns all day.

153
00:10:48,243 --> 00:10:51,683
Dude, as much as you may think,
money ain't always the answer.

154
00:10:51,716 --> 00:10:53,418
Sure as hell would solve
a lot of my problems right now.

155
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,219
I mean, come on, man,
I want to do something big.

156
00:10:55,252 --> 00:10:56,722
I want to, you know,
do something great,

157
00:10:56,754 --> 00:10:58,157
live the dream!

158
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:59,859
While you do that,
I'm gonna dream

159
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:02,230
of cheap drinks
and cute waitresses.

160
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,433
Here you guys go.

161
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:07,870
Feeling better, Jonas?

162
00:11:07,902 --> 00:11:09,672
Yeah, I always feel good
around you.

163
00:11:11,108 --> 00:11:13,444
You can, throw these
on Jonas' tab.

164
00:11:13,477 --> 00:11:15,080
All right,
will do, hon.

165
00:11:15,113 --> 00:11:16,748
It's gonna be ten total.

166
00:11:16,782 --> 00:11:18,283
Man.

167
00:11:18,317 --> 00:11:19,784
Dude, I'm gonna need
to borrow ten bucks.

168
00:11:19,817 --> 00:11:21,421
Are you kidding me?

169
00:11:49,024 --> 00:11:51,126
Hey, sweet cheeks!

170
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:54,296
When we gonna split
a bottle and a bed?

171
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:57,334
I told you, Sampson,
I don't date customers.

172
00:11:57,367 --> 00:11:59,437
Honey,
after a couple drinks,

173
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,841
you won't care who I am.

174
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,813
Sampson, all the drinks
in the world couldn't do that.

175
00:12:06,846 --> 00:12:09,083
Well, it was worth a try.

176
00:12:16,192 --> 00:12:18,295
We will report
more as we follow this story.

177
00:12:18,328 --> 00:12:19,496
Watch your heads tonight.

178
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:21,099
Astronomers
at Griffith Observatory

179
00:12:21,132 --> 00:12:23,235
are preparing
for a surprise meteor shower.

180
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:24,971
The meteors,
which are expected

181
00:12:25,003 --> 00:12:27,007
to come down in the greater
Los Angeles area...

182
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,577
-Here's your change.
-Thanks.

183
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,279
...which brought
the planet a near miss

184
00:12:31,312 --> 00:12:33,817
with a meteor the size
of a six-story building

185
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,053
that by all accounts seems
to have burned up on entry

186
00:12:36,086 --> 00:12:37,587
when it disappeared
from astronomers'...

187
00:12:37,621 --> 00:12:39,391
Love to get my hand
on one of those rocks.

188
00:12:39,424 --> 00:12:40,826
Make a bundle.

189
00:12:40,858 --> 00:12:42,027
What do you mean?

190
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,196
Meteorites, meteors.

191
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:46,232
You know, pretty cool.

192
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,969
Stuff's been floating
around our galaxy for ages

193
00:12:49,003 --> 00:12:51,005
just collecting space dust.

194
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:53,475
Then they just hit
our atmo and burn up

195
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:55,978
like glittery diamonds.

196
00:12:56,011 --> 00:12:57,315
Yeah.

197
00:12:57,348 --> 00:13:00,251
You know, they hit Earth
on a regular basis.

198
00:13:00,283 --> 00:13:02,553
There's all kinds
of different rocks:

199
00:13:02,586 --> 00:13:04,957
irony rocks, stone rocks,
stony iron rocks.

200
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,993
Irony ones are the ones
that are worth the most

201
00:13:07,026 --> 00:13:09,062
and easiest to find,
I guess.

202
00:13:09,096 --> 00:13:12,167
Other ones just look
like regular rocks.

203
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:13,502
-But yeah.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

204
00:13:13,535 --> 00:13:14,604
I mean, the mete...

205
00:13:14,637 --> 00:13:16,104
The mete... meteoroids

206
00:13:16,138 --> 00:13:20,077
and the...
The glistening rocks

207
00:13:20,111 --> 00:13:21,511
and the night highway.

208
00:13:21,544 --> 00:13:23,948
I-I can't get...
I love them. I love them.

209
00:13:23,982 --> 00:13:25,284
I can't get enough of them.

210
00:13:25,317 --> 00:13:27,020
I mean, you certainly seem
to like them.

211
00:13:27,052 --> 00:13:29,890
Yeah, my cousin works
at the science museum.

212
00:13:29,923 --> 00:13:32,293
She says people pay
top dollar for space rocks.

213
00:13:32,326 --> 00:13:34,229
Really, that so?

214
00:13:34,262 --> 00:13:36,432
Some guy had one crash
into his living room a year ago.

215
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:39,236
He was pissed as hell
until he sold it.

216
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:41,138
Bought a brand-new house.

217
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:44,943
Good to know.

218
00:13:48,347 --> 00:13:49,582
Thanks.

219
00:13:49,615 --> 00:13:51,019
Yeah.

220
00:13:55,056 --> 00:13:56,157
Hey, wake up, wake up, wake up.

221
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,159
Come on, come on, come on.

222
00:13:57,192 --> 00:13:58,527
We got work to do.

223
00:14:00,531 --> 00:14:03,133
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

224
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:04,568
Come on, come on, come on,
here you go.

225
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:06,237
I'm not done with it!

226
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,174
Right, left.

227
00:14:08,207 --> 00:14:09,509
You got this.
You got this.

228
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:12,478
Look at you.
You tiny dancer, you.

229
00:14:12,511 --> 00:14:13,714
-Okay.
-Leave me here.

230
00:14:13,748 --> 00:14:15,282
I can't leave you.

231
00:14:15,315 --> 00:14:16,952
Tomorrow's
gonna be awful.

232
00:14:16,985 --> 00:14:18,354
What!
Tomorrow's gonna be awesome.

233
00:14:18,387 --> 00:14:20,090
Let's get you some coffee.

234
00:14:21,725 --> 00:14:23,494
All right, buddy.
Come on, come on.

235
00:14:23,526 --> 00:14:28,367
Almost, yep. Close. There.
Okay, nice, nice.

236
00:14:31,672 --> 00:14:33,173
Meteor shower
is impressing thousands

237
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,110
all across
Southern California.

238
00:14:35,143 --> 00:14:37,312
Authorities have reported
meteor impacts

239
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:39,115
in the Angeles National Forest

240
00:14:39,147 --> 00:14:41,417
as well as
Joshua Tree National Park.

241
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,152
In other news,
there are a growing number

242
00:14:43,185 --> 00:14:45,190
of disappearances
in the high desert area

243
00:14:45,223 --> 00:14:48,227
which local sheriff's
departments attribute...

244
00:15:01,411 --> 00:15:04,014
So let me
get this straight.

245
00:15:06,483 --> 00:15:08,786
You want to go
digging up space rocks

246
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:11,056
in the middle
of the goddamn night?

247
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:12,290
Dude, they're worth a fortune!

248
00:15:12,324 --> 00:15:15,028
So is a good night's sleep.

249
00:15:15,061 --> 00:15:17,364
Jonas, just promise me
this is not gonna turn out

250
00:15:17,398 --> 00:15:19,735
like the jackrabbit scheme;
remember that?

251
00:15:19,768 --> 00:15:22,472
It would've worked
if somebody hadn't gotten angry.

252
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,209
Besides, man, I told you,
rabbits spook easy.

253
00:15:25,242 --> 00:15:28,680
Candice told me these things
are worth a ton of money.

254
00:15:28,713 --> 00:15:31,651
Candice told you.
Great, yeah.

255
00:15:31,683 --> 00:15:33,586
We're gonna find
one of these things,

256
00:15:33,619 --> 00:15:35,188
we're gonna sell it,

257
00:15:35,221 --> 00:15:37,559
and we're gonna split
the profit 60-40.

258
00:15:37,592 --> 00:15:41,697
Wait, and why
would you get 60%?

259
00:15:41,729 --> 00:15:43,699
Because it was my idea.

260
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:45,234
Yeah, and it's
a half-assed idea,

261
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:46,769
so you should get half.

262
00:15:46,802 --> 00:15:48,172
Fifty-fifty.

263
00:15:48,206 --> 00:15:50,476
You know what? Fine.
Fifty-fifty.

264
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:52,510
But that's only because
I'm your friend.

265
00:15:52,543 --> 00:15:54,814
And, we're using my truck.

266
00:15:54,847 --> 00:15:56,382
I thought this was our truck.

267
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,252
I mean, it's got
my name on it too.

268
00:15:58,285 --> 00:16:01,390
No, no, no, that's only
'cause I'm your friend.

269
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,545
Dude, where the hell
are we, anyways?

270
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:20,281
Here, hand me the map.

271
00:16:22,217 --> 00:16:26,189
Thanks. Nice.

272
00:16:26,222 --> 00:16:28,660
-Got it. Got it.
-Jesus.

273
00:16:30,493 --> 00:16:31,529
God damn it.

274
00:16:31,562 --> 00:16:32,663
Sorry.

275
00:16:32,696 --> 00:16:33,832
So violent.

276
00:16:40,742 --> 00:16:41,877
No, man. Look.

277
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,478
Dude, what is that?

278
00:16:43,511 --> 00:16:44,446
All right, you know what?

279
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:45,547
If we go...

280
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,583
if we go
about 20 more miles...

281
00:16:47,616 --> 00:16:48,684
Jonas, look out!

282
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:49,719
Jesus Christ!

283
00:16:53,725 --> 00:16:57,831
Ohhhhh, man.

284
00:16:57,863 --> 00:16:59,866
I told you to keep
your eyes on the road.

285
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:07,943
Man.

286
00:17:07,977 --> 00:17:10,548
Holy goddamn.

287
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:14,819
Jesus!

288
00:17:14,851 --> 00:17:16,656
Is that an electrical tower?

289
00:17:16,688 --> 00:17:18,591
Sure looks like it.

290
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,361
How the hell did that come down?

291
00:17:22,862 --> 00:17:26,701
Hey, man, whatever it was, we're
not getting around that mess.

292
00:17:26,735 --> 00:17:28,671
Come on, let's go.

293
00:17:28,705 --> 00:17:30,274
Jonas.

294
00:17:31,941 --> 00:17:33,644
Jonas, let's go.

295
00:17:34,945 --> 00:17:36,514
Something must have hit it.

296
00:17:36,548 --> 00:17:39,219
Yeah, what,
one of your meteorites?

297
00:17:41,821 --> 00:17:44,258
-No.
-Yeah.

298
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,763
Yeah.
Grab the flashlights.

299
00:17:47,896 --> 00:17:49,398
Sure.

300
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,467
Goddamn,
I hate you sometimes.

301
00:17:51,501 --> 00:17:53,338
Yeah, well, you can
hate me after we're rich.

302
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:54,839
Dude, what are we even
looking for out here?

303
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:56,609
Dude, I already
told you, a space rock!

304
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:57,776
A space rock, okay.

305
00:17:57,808 --> 00:17:59,011
And how does a space rock

306
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:00,546
look different
from a regular rock?

307
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,747
I don't know,
probably like

308
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,251
it came from space
or something.

309
00:18:04,285 --> 00:18:05,754
This is crazy. I'm crazy.

310
00:18:05,787 --> 00:18:07,521
-I can't believe I'm doing this.
-Me neither.

311
00:18:07,555 --> 00:18:09,359
You're not exactly
the adventurous type.

312
00:18:09,392 --> 00:18:10,660
-Hey, neither are you.
-Hey!

313
00:18:10,693 --> 00:18:11,762
And this ain't an adventure.

314
00:18:11,794 --> 00:18:13,396
It's a wild goose chase.

315
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:18,470
I mean, shit, Jonas,
there ain't nothing out here

316
00:18:18,504 --> 00:18:19,772
but dirt and more dirt.

317
00:18:19,804 --> 00:18:21,507
Lars, you saw
that tower back there.

318
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:22,976
There's something out here.
Keep looking.

319
00:18:23,008 --> 00:18:24,746
Dude, it probably fell
from a quake or something.

320
00:18:24,778 --> 00:18:26,314
I mean, come on, man.

321
00:18:26,346 --> 00:18:27,915
I do not want to spend
all night out here.

322
00:18:27,949 --> 00:18:30,386
It's cold, dark,
and I feel ridiculous.

323
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,023
-Come on.
-Ridiculous? Ridiculous?

324
00:18:33,056 --> 00:18:36,326
You know when I feel ridiculous is when
I'm planting shrubs and shit all day.

325
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,495
You don't see me complaining.

326
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:38,596
I don't see you complaining?

327
00:18:38,629 --> 00:18:39,831
That's all you do!

328
00:18:39,865 --> 00:18:41,501
Come on, man, take a chance!

329
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:42,701
I mean, think about it.

330
00:18:42,734 --> 00:18:44,070
We could get rid
of the yard work thing.

331
00:18:44,104 --> 00:18:45,506
How bad would that be?

332
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:46,808
I like the yard work thing,
Jonas.

333
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,841
Man.

334
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:48,843
It's simple, honest work

335
00:18:48,876 --> 00:18:49,945
that happens during the day.

336
00:18:49,977 --> 00:18:51,813
And you know what it doesn't do?

337
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:53,617
It doesn't leave me wandering
through the goddamn desert

338
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,554
in the middle of the night
looking for space rocks!

339
00:18:56,586 --> 00:18:57,988
You know what? Screw it.

340
00:18:58,022 --> 00:18:59,058
-Lars.
-I'm out of here.

341
00:18:59,091 --> 00:19:00,325
I'm going back to the truck.

342
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:01,627
Lars, come on, man.

343
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,095
Good luck chasing your miracles.

344
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:04,899
Lars!

345
00:19:04,932 --> 00:19:06,033
God damn it.

346
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:07,835
The truck's back that way.

347
00:19:10,137 --> 00:19:11,039
Shit.

348
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:13,343
Lars!

349
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,721
Holy crap!

350
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:28,062
This is exactly how I wanted
to spend my friday night.

351
00:19:28,094 --> 00:19:29,564
Dude, give me a hand.

352
00:19:29,596 --> 00:19:31,399
It smells
like rotten eggs down here.

353
00:19:35,872 --> 00:19:38,509
What are you looking at?

354
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,612
-That's it. That's a space rock.
-I'll be damned.

355
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:47,654
God, this thing's got...
Thing's got some heft.

356
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,956
It's still warm.

357
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:50,824
-Yeah.
-I wonder what it's made out of.

358
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:52,794
Probably something valuable.

359
00:19:52,828 --> 00:19:54,530
So much for the wild
goose chase?

360
00:19:54,563 --> 00:19:56,032
Shut up.

361
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:57,700
All right, let's get this thing
back to the truck.

362
00:19:57,734 --> 00:19:59,871
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

363
00:20:11,485 --> 00:20:13,421
Come on, man, let's go!

364
00:20:17,894 --> 00:20:21,132
Come on, man,
we're almost there!

365
00:20:21,165 --> 00:20:22,734
I wonder if they pay
by the ounce.

366
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:23,902
Here.

367
00:20:26,906 --> 00:20:29,176
Hey, you mind if we tell Candice
I found the rock?

368
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:30,178
I don't care.

369
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,413
Go impress your lady friend.

370
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,566
Dang it.

371
00:21:39,335 --> 00:21:40,837
My God.

372
00:21:42,705 --> 00:21:43,773
My God.

373
00:21:56,823 --> 00:21:58,093
Hello.

374
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:00,762
This is, Jonas from...

375
00:22:00,795 --> 00:22:02,265
The guy from the bar.

376
00:22:02,297 --> 00:22:04,201
From friday,
you know, every friday.

377
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:06,570
Right, hey.

378
00:22:06,604 --> 00:22:08,740
You know, when I gave you
my number,

379
00:22:08,772 --> 00:22:13,813
I didn't expect you to call me
at 7:30 on a saturday morning.

380
00:22:13,847 --> 00:22:14,949
Are you drunk?

381
00:22:14,982 --> 00:22:16,885
No, no, no, why?

382
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:19,722
Why... why... why would I
be drunk? I mean, I just...

383
00:22:19,754 --> 00:22:22,091
No, I just... I...

384
00:22:22,123 --> 00:22:24,627
You know, I called
to just, you know...

385
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,597
Yeah?

386
00:22:26,631 --> 00:22:28,833
-Remember those space rocks?
-What?

387
00:22:28,865 --> 00:22:29,969
We found a meteorite,
a space rock.

388
00:22:30,001 --> 00:22:31,069
We found it all by ourselves.

389
00:22:31,103 --> 00:22:32,103
I mean myself.
I found it.

390
00:22:32,136 --> 00:22:34,173
Well...

391
00:22:36,242 --> 00:22:39,013
-Good.
-Yeah I...

392
00:22:39,047 --> 00:22:40,348
I... I... I,
wanted to know

393
00:22:40,382 --> 00:22:41,918
if maybe we could stop by
and, you know,

394
00:22:41,951 --> 00:22:43,653
you could take a look at it
and, you know,

395
00:22:43,685 --> 00:22:47,123
just kind of give... give us
your expert opinion on it.

396
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:49,994
Now?

397
00:22:50,028 --> 00:22:51,898
Sure?

398
00:22:54,099 --> 00:22:56,937
Hell, I'm already awake, so...

399
00:22:56,969 --> 00:22:58,372
meteors!

400
00:22:58,406 --> 00:22:59,874
It's one way to start the day.

401
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,016
-Are you still there?
-Yeah, yeah, still here.

402
00:23:06,048 --> 00:23:08,885
Still here, always here for you.

403
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:14,294
All right,
let me give you my address.

404
00:23:21,436 --> 00:23:23,872
God.

405
00:23:31,148 --> 00:23:34,152
Well, what crawled up your butt
and made you so happy this morning?

406
00:23:34,185 --> 00:23:35,954
I just made a phone call.

407
00:23:35,988 --> 00:23:37,190
About the rock?

408
00:23:37,222 --> 00:23:38,458
Yeah, you could say that.

409
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,730
Your phone got GPS?

410
00:23:41,762 --> 00:23:43,698
Can I use this?
I'm gonna use this.

411
00:23:43,732 --> 00:23:45,467
Yes, go for it.

412
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:46,769
So where are we headed?

413
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:48,772
Candice's.

414
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:51,008
No shit.
How'd that happen?

415
00:23:51,042 --> 00:23:52,377
Just lucky, I guess.

416
00:23:52,409 --> 00:23:53,344
How do I look?

417
00:23:54,446 --> 00:23:55,947
-Good.
-Yeah?

418
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,184
Yeah, yeah, you look lively.

419
00:24:00,386 --> 00:24:01,388
-All right.
-Sure.

420
00:24:01,421 --> 00:24:03,223
I can do lively.
Yeah.

421
00:24:18,109 --> 00:24:20,147
Hey, buddy,
you smell that?

422
00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:24,151
Something in the...
Something in the air?

423
00:24:24,185 --> 00:24:25,821
Yeah, actually.

424
00:24:25,853 --> 00:24:27,023
What is that?

425
00:24:29,491 --> 00:24:32,329
That's the smell of change,
my friend.

426
00:24:34,966 --> 00:24:36,368
Lars, I wasn't being serious.

427
00:24:36,401 --> 00:24:37,937
You can't actually smell change.

428
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,807
Jesus.

429
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:43,543
Come on, man, you look like a dog
with your head in the wind right now.

430
00:24:43,577 --> 00:24:45,247
-Stay with me here.
-Shut up for a second, okay?

431
00:24:46,947 --> 00:24:48,183
Smells like rotten eggs.

432
00:24:48,216 --> 00:24:50,521
God.

433
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:55,360
-Shit.
-What?

434
00:24:55,392 --> 00:24:57,063
I don't want to smell shit.
Roll up your window.

435
00:25:13,416 --> 00:25:15,285
What the...

436
00:25:17,989 --> 00:25:20,126
-What the hell is that thing?
-I don't know.

437
00:25:20,158 --> 00:25:23,362
Looks like a goddamn
mutant pelican.

438
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,531
Pelican?

439
00:25:24,563 --> 00:25:27,034
Like a bird or something.

440
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,037
Yeah, well, that's
one angry goddamn bird.

441
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,878
Whoaaaaaa.

442
00:25:34,912 --> 00:25:35,880
God damn it.

443
00:25:37,047 --> 00:25:38,416
Jesus Christ!

444
00:25:40,117 --> 00:25:41,554
My god!

445
00:25:49,364 --> 00:25:51,334
Get it off the truck.
Get it off!

446
00:26:01,078 --> 00:26:02,280
Get it off.

447
00:26:02,314 --> 00:26:03,583
Shake it loose.
Come on.

448
00:26:03,615 --> 00:26:05,419
-My arm!
-My god, are you okay?

449
00:26:07,922 --> 00:26:10,392
Come on, get off.

450
00:26:10,424 --> 00:26:11,659
I don't think it likes
us very much.

451
00:26:11,692 --> 00:26:13,195
Yeah?

452
00:26:14,696 --> 00:26:17,534
Well, let's see how it likes
sudden stops.

453
00:26:25,078 --> 00:26:26,346
My baby.

454
00:26:26,379 --> 00:26:28,049
He tore up my baby.

455
00:26:30,217 --> 00:26:32,287
Shit, he's still going.
He's still going.

456
00:26:32,321 --> 00:26:33,923
Should I turn around?

457
00:26:33,956 --> 00:26:35,659
No, screw that.

458
00:26:35,691 --> 00:26:36,559
Drive.

459
00:26:50,378 --> 00:26:51,513
I think we got it, man!

460
00:26:51,545 --> 00:26:53,315
I think we got it!
I think we...

461
00:26:55,551 --> 00:26:58,621
We got it!

462
00:26:58,655 --> 00:27:01,426
-My baby. My baby.
-My God. My God.

463
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:03,028
What did he do to you?

464
00:27:06,031 --> 00:27:08,735
My truck was fine
before today, Jonas.

465
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:10,371
Sorry.

466
00:27:23,754 --> 00:27:26,225
Hold your horses.
I'm coming.

467
00:27:30,797 --> 00:27:32,032
Val?

468
00:27:32,065 --> 00:27:34,336
Mornin', roomie.

469
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,311
Christ, Val, do you have
any idea what time it is?

470
00:27:41,345 --> 00:27:43,315
It's saturday morning.
Does it matter?

471
00:27:43,347 --> 00:27:45,216
I lost my keys again.

472
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,619
But I had another adventure
last night.

473
00:27:47,653 --> 00:27:50,057
What was his name?

474
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:52,259
Rodriguez.

475
00:27:53,261 --> 00:27:54,796
Val, I work in a bar

476
00:27:54,829 --> 00:27:56,432
and I don't drink
as much as you do.

477
00:27:56,465 --> 00:27:58,534
It is not my fault
that you don't know

478
00:27:58,566 --> 00:28:00,636
how to relax or get
shit-faced for free.

479
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,806
Well, sorry I'm never
in the mood to be felt up

480
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,210
by some douche bag
just to get some cheap drinks.

481
00:28:06,243 --> 00:28:07,612
Don't knock it until you try it.

482
00:28:09,182 --> 00:28:11,116
Speaking of knocking.

483
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,586
Excuse me, I have a date.

484
00:28:12,618 --> 00:28:14,521
On saturday morning?

485
00:28:14,555 --> 00:28:16,658
God, you're such a prude!

486
00:28:18,394 --> 00:28:20,163
Well, good morning, Cand-ass.

487
00:28:20,195 --> 00:28:21,331
Hi, Vince.

488
00:28:21,363 --> 00:28:23,399
Is Valerie here?

489
00:28:23,433 --> 00:28:25,504
She just got in.

490
00:28:33,681 --> 00:28:35,315
That's your date?

491
00:28:35,348 --> 00:28:36,583
Shut up.

492
00:28:36,616 --> 00:28:39,120
Valerie, my little concubine.

493
00:28:39,153 --> 00:28:40,690
Hi, Vincey.

494
00:28:40,722 --> 00:28:43,626
Now, Valerie, don't start
playing hard to get.

495
00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:45,228
Vince, once a month.

496
00:28:45,261 --> 00:28:47,299
That's as easy
as it gets for you.

497
00:28:47,331 --> 00:28:48,833
Well, that's why
I'm here, actually.

498
00:28:48,867 --> 00:28:51,570
I wanted to renegotiate
your lease.

499
00:28:51,603 --> 00:28:54,341
I was thinking,
twice a month.

500
00:28:54,373 --> 00:28:56,810
Are you sure you could
even last that long?

501
00:28:56,843 --> 00:28:59,881
Vince, can you please go perv up
our apartment some other time?

502
00:28:59,914 --> 00:29:01,683
I'm waiting for a friend
to arrive.

503
00:29:01,717 --> 00:29:02,719
She's got a date.

504
00:29:02,751 --> 00:29:05,589
On a saturday morning?

505
00:29:05,623 --> 00:29:07,624
God, you're a prude, ain't ya?

506
00:29:07,658 --> 00:29:09,628
Val, you really got
to get this one laid.

507
00:29:09,661 --> 00:29:11,530
That's what I've been saying.

508
00:29:21,476 --> 00:29:25,149
All right, I'm going.

509
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:26,749
But think about my offer, Val.

510
00:29:26,783 --> 00:29:30,189
I'll even throw in
free utilities.

511
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,231
And if you ever want
to make alternate payments,

512
00:29:38,265 --> 00:29:40,869
I'm always open
to suggestions.

513
00:29:40,902 --> 00:29:43,539
I suggest you leave.

514
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:56,657
If you want
to "renegotiate your lease."

515
00:29:56,689 --> 00:29:59,494
You are unbelievable.

516
00:29:59,526 --> 00:30:01,295
I'm extraordinary.

517
00:30:01,329 --> 00:30:02,731
That's one word for it.

518
00:30:02,764 --> 00:30:04,801
I really need a shower.

519
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:06,969
I can't believe you're still
sleeping with our landlord.

520
00:30:07,002 --> 00:30:09,973
Well, I can't believe that
you're still paying for rent.

521
00:30:10,007 --> 00:30:11,710
Barely.

522
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:16,281
Christ!

523
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,552
-What else do you want?
-Hey, how's it going?

524
00:30:18,585 --> 00:30:20,555
Hey, we got attacked
by a bird on the way over.

525
00:30:20,588 --> 00:30:22,389
It was a really big one.

526
00:30:22,423 --> 00:30:24,360
I think it was some kind
of a mutant...

527
00:30:24,392 --> 00:30:26,862
Some kind of a mutant bird,
really freaked us out.

528
00:30:26,896 --> 00:30:28,999
All right, look, this thing's
kind of heavy, okay?

529
00:30:29,032 --> 00:30:30,635
This pansy's afraid
of elevators.

530
00:30:30,668 --> 00:30:32,437
You live on the tenth floor.

531
00:30:32,469 --> 00:30:33,771
Can we come in, please?

532
00:30:33,805 --> 00:30:36,543
Yeah.

533
00:30:36,575 --> 00:30:39,681
-Okay, thanks.
-Hi.

534
00:30:52,897 --> 00:30:55,568
-Don't move.
-All right.

535
00:30:55,601 --> 00:30:57,703
You need to stop moving
and dancing in your seat.

536
00:30:57,735 --> 00:30:59,006
Okay, okay.

537
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:01,508
Now you're just wriggling.
Stop it.

538
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:06,315
You said a bird attacked you?

539
00:31:06,347 --> 00:31:07,884
Yeah, I mean,
that's what they look like.

540
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:09,653
Tell you what, though:
they're way less friendlier

541
00:31:09,685 --> 00:31:12,356
than they are
on the Discover Channel.

542
00:31:12,388 --> 00:31:13,824
We totally badassed it, though.

543
00:31:13,857 --> 00:31:15,559
KO'd that son of a bitch.

544
00:31:15,593 --> 00:31:17,463
Knocked him right on his ass.
Boom.

545
00:31:19,065 --> 00:31:20,701
And how did you slay

546
00:31:20,734 --> 00:31:23,871
this mighty beast,
O brave knight?

547
00:31:23,905 --> 00:31:25,639
I ain't no knight.

548
00:31:25,673 --> 00:31:27,576
But, you know, at one point,
he's right on top of us,

549
00:31:27,609 --> 00:31:28,711
and then, bam,
I hit the brakes.

550
00:31:28,744 --> 00:31:30,680
Sucker must've flew 50 feet.

551
00:31:30,714 --> 00:31:32,850
Saved both our asses.

552
00:31:32,882 --> 00:31:34,384
What? I did!

553
00:31:34,418 --> 00:31:35,921
I did. Go ahead, ask Lars.

554
00:31:35,953 --> 00:31:38,356
-Please don't.
-Sounds dangerous.

555
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:40,961
You getting into the monster
slaying business now?

556
00:31:43,394 --> 00:31:44,464
I'm kidding.

557
00:31:47,534 --> 00:31:49,071
I'm glad you're okay.

558
00:31:51,608 --> 00:31:53,377
You know, you're cute
when you blush.

559
00:31:53,409 --> 00:31:58,683
And last night, we...
I mean Jonas

560
00:31:58,717 --> 00:32:00,820
found this.

561
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,722
What is that?

562
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:05,893
Only the biggest damn payday
you've ever seen.

563
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,702
It's warm.

564
00:32:12,734 --> 00:32:14,070
Yeah, it's been sitting

565
00:32:14,104 --> 00:32:16,407
in the back of my truck
all morning.

566
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,909
I've never seen
anything like it.

567
00:32:17,942 --> 00:32:20,079
Yeah, I don't think anyone has.

568
00:32:20,111 --> 00:32:22,547
Thing fell out of the sky
last night.

569
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,551
I fished it out of the desert.

570
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:25,952
Dude, what?

571
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,688
It's bad enough you have us
bring it to her.

572
00:32:27,722 --> 00:32:30,493
Now you're gonna tell her
where to find more?

573
00:32:30,525 --> 00:32:32,795
She ain't interested
in the money.

574
00:32:34,464 --> 00:32:36,868
Besides, she thinks I'm cute,
man, come on.

575
00:32:36,901 --> 00:32:38,903
I want 20%.

576
00:32:38,936 --> 00:32:40,138
God damn it.

577
00:32:40,172 --> 00:32:41,907
Jonas, you're about as dumb

578
00:32:41,941 --> 00:32:43,876
as a bowling ball
when it comes to women.

579
00:32:45,745 --> 00:32:46,946
What for?

580
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,450
Call it a finder's fee.

581
00:32:48,483 --> 00:32:50,652
Okay. But you didn't find it.

582
00:32:50,685 --> 00:32:52,053
And you wouldn't have
if I hadn't

583
00:32:52,087 --> 00:32:54,558
have told Jonas
it was worth looking for.

584
00:32:54,591 --> 00:32:57,427
Really?

585
00:32:57,461 --> 00:32:59,630
All right, fine, 20%...

586
00:32:59,663 --> 00:33:00,665
Out of his share.

587
00:33:02,668 --> 00:33:04,004
Wait, wait, wait.

588
00:33:04,036 --> 00:33:05,104
Wait a minute. That ain't fair.

589
00:33:05,138 --> 00:33:06,206
That ain't fair, really?

590
00:33:06,238 --> 00:33:07,474
What's the count at now?

591
00:33:07,508 --> 00:33:08,809
How much money do you owe me?

592
00:33:10,711 --> 00:33:12,881
-Twenty percent.
-Deal.

593
00:33:12,913 --> 00:33:14,750
Let me call my cousin.
She works at the museum.

594
00:33:17,521 --> 00:33:19,190
What about that damn bird?

595
00:33:19,223 --> 00:33:20,591
What about it?

596
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:22,461
It's dead. You killed it.

597
00:33:22,493 --> 00:33:24,464
Exactly!
You owe me your life for that.

598
00:33:24,496 --> 00:33:27,567
And don't think that's worth
any less than what I owe you.

599
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:30,772
All right, fine.

600
00:33:30,804 --> 00:33:32,874
Ten percent
from each of our shares.

601
00:33:32,908 --> 00:33:34,642
Does that work?

602
00:33:34,676 --> 00:33:36,046
Deal.

603
00:33:36,078 --> 00:33:37,613
But I don't want to hear
any more about

604
00:33:37,646 --> 00:33:40,550
that "lazy son of a bitch Jonas"
ever again.

605
00:33:40,584 --> 00:33:41,886
All right, all right, all right.

606
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,856
I admit it.
You did good here.

607
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:45,858
And you even managed
to call her.

608
00:33:45,892 --> 00:33:48,629
Guess you just needed a push
in the right direction.

609
00:33:48,662 --> 00:33:49,797
Thank you.

610
00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:52,000
Doesn't make you less lazy.

611
00:33:54,069 --> 00:33:55,872
Just more respectable.

612
00:33:55,905 --> 00:33:57,808
I like respectable.

613
00:33:58,975 --> 00:34:00,678
Guys.

614
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,112
Something's wrong.

615
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:06,819
My God.

616
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,071
Maybe we shouldn't be
so close to these windows.

617
00:34:24,342 --> 00:34:25,811
Dude, dude, dude, dude,
I'm getting the feeling

618
00:34:25,843 --> 00:34:26,778
this one's staring at me.

619
00:34:26,811 --> 00:34:28,046
Is that weird?

620
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:44,569
Can, I'm taking
your shorts again.

621
00:34:44,603 --> 00:34:46,137
Valerie, shut up for once.

622
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,940
You're taking them again?

623
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:07,766
We got to distract it.

624
00:35:07,798 --> 00:35:08,900
How?

625
00:35:12,071 --> 00:35:14,242
Lars. Lars.

626
00:35:16,711 --> 00:35:17,846
Your lighter.

627
00:35:21,384 --> 00:35:22,753
Toss me your lighter.

628
00:35:22,785 --> 00:35:23,653
What are you doing?

629
00:35:29,662 --> 00:35:30,663
Trust me.

630
00:35:31,931 --> 00:35:33,867
Hey, hey there,
Big Bird.

631
00:35:36,436 --> 00:35:37,939
Take it easy now.

632
00:35:37,973 --> 00:35:39,642
No need to go
all Cookie Monster on us.

633
00:35:43,846 --> 00:35:44,915
Run.

634
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:47,820
Run!

635
00:35:53,793 --> 00:35:54,994
Got him.

636
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,931
Come on!
Let's get out of here!

637
00:35:58,332 --> 00:35:59,769
Did you see that shit?

638
00:35:59,801 --> 00:36:01,102
I did that.
I did that.

639
00:36:01,136 --> 00:36:02,438
My truck's in the alley.
Let's go!

640
00:36:02,471 --> 00:36:05,309
-The elevators!
-God, not the elevator.

641
00:36:06,776 --> 00:36:07,911
You know it's not
gonna get here

642
00:36:07,944 --> 00:36:09,781
any faster
if you keep doing that.

643
00:36:09,815 --> 00:36:10,949
Would you stop that?

644
00:36:10,981 --> 00:36:12,050
We're not taking the stairs.

645
00:36:12,083 --> 00:36:14,086
We're all sticking together.

646
00:36:16,155 --> 00:36:17,257
This elevator sucks.

647
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:19,060
Blame the landlord.

648
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,296
What the hell
is all this noise?

649
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:23,199
Who the hell are you?

650
00:36:23,232 --> 00:36:25,102
Who am I?

651
00:36:25,135 --> 00:36:28,473
I'm the building manager.
That's who I am, sonny Jim.

652
00:36:28,505 --> 00:36:30,475
Who the hell are you,
Huckleberry Finn?

653
00:36:30,507 --> 00:36:34,179
We... we were just
on our way out, sir.

654
00:36:34,213 --> 00:36:35,449
What's that smell?

655
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,953
You've been smoking
in that apartment again.

656
00:36:38,985 --> 00:36:41,022
-Haven't you?
-With the...

657
00:36:41,055 --> 00:36:42,924
I told you before,
it's grounds for eviction.

658
00:36:42,957 --> 00:36:44,226
Give me five minutes.

659
00:36:44,259 --> 00:36:45,928
I'll do the paperwork right now.

660
00:36:45,962 --> 00:36:47,432
Turn! Turn!

661
00:36:53,036 --> 00:36:54,439
Go, go, go!

662
00:36:54,472 --> 00:36:55,908
God. God.

663
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,328
So... so that guy was...

664
00:37:11,361 --> 00:37:12,864
An asshole.

665
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:14,166
And you are?

666
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:16,803
-Valerie, my roommate.
-Okay, okay.

667
00:37:16,836 --> 00:37:19,005
This is exactly how I wanted
to spend my weekend.

668
00:37:19,038 --> 00:37:21,174
-Right.
-You're telling me.

669
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:23,178
You gonna be okay?

670
00:37:23,211 --> 00:37:24,781
Shit.

671
00:37:25,915 --> 00:37:27,985
How am I gonna pay my rent now?

672
00:37:29,852 --> 00:37:31,422
What?

673
00:37:34,492 --> 00:37:36,561
No! No!

674
00:37:36,595 --> 00:37:38,332
Out the back!
Out the back!

675
00:37:45,006 --> 00:37:47,376
-There it is!
-I missed it.

676
00:37:50,613 --> 00:37:52,249
My truck!

677
00:37:52,281 --> 00:37:54,219
-Our truck!
-We'll take my car.

678
00:37:54,252 --> 00:37:55,353
Come on! Let's go!

679
00:37:55,386 --> 00:37:57,323
-Bitch.
-Come on, dude.

680
00:37:57,356 --> 00:37:59,293
-Come on!
-Bastard!

681
00:38:02,896 --> 00:38:04,998
You guys, my car is
on the other side of the garage.

682
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,402
I'm gonna kill them.

683
00:38:06,435 --> 00:38:07,969
I'm gonna kill
all those freaking birds.

684
00:38:08,002 --> 00:38:09,438
They're not birds.
They're lizards.

685
00:38:09,472 --> 00:38:11,541
Val, hurry up!

686
00:38:11,574 --> 00:38:13,477
-Lizards, like toads?
-I'm gonna kill them.

687
00:38:13,509 --> 00:38:14,913
I'm gonna kill
all those freaking lizards.

688
00:38:14,945 --> 00:38:16,380
Toads aren't lizards.

689
00:38:16,413 --> 00:38:17,616
Didn't you guys ever
learn that in school?

690
00:38:17,648 --> 00:38:19,418
Hey, I went to school.

691
00:38:19,452 --> 00:38:21,020
Mostly.

692
00:38:21,054 --> 00:38:22,889
Lizards,
like dinosaurs.

693
00:38:22,922 --> 00:38:24,458
I'm gonna kill
all these freakin' dinosaurs.

694
00:38:24,492 --> 00:38:25,994
Dinosaurs died out,
like, a million years ago.

695
00:38:26,026 --> 00:38:27,229
That's impossible.

696
00:38:27,262 --> 00:38:28,598
I used
to love them as a kid.

697
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,998
They looked so pretty
in the drawings.

698
00:38:30,031 --> 00:38:31,367
What kind
of dinosaurs are these?

699
00:38:31,401 --> 00:38:32,903
I can't be sure
for certain,

700
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,538
but they kind of look
like pterodactyls.

701
00:38:34,571 --> 00:38:35,906
Terror-dactyls.

702
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,509
Ptero-dactyl.

703
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:39,110
Fitting name, at least.

704
00:38:39,144 --> 00:38:40,947
Well, whatever they are,
they're everywhere.

705
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,050
-We need to get somewhere safe.
-Can't we just kill 'em?

706
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:44,452
What, with rubbing alcohol
and matches?

707
00:38:44,485 --> 00:38:46,587
Because that worked
so well last time.

708
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,590
Hey, saved your ass, didn't it?

709
00:38:52,495 --> 00:38:53,897
-I killed one.
-With your brakes.

710
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,099
I could do it again.

711
00:38:55,131 --> 00:38:56,600
Look, guys, can we hide
back at the bar?

712
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,168
I mean, a drink's
always made me feel better.

713
00:38:58,201 --> 00:38:59,671
-What?
-No.

714
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:01,473
We need to go somewhere
where we can defend ourselves,

715
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:04,944
somewhere that they can't
easily get into.

716
00:39:04,978 --> 00:39:06,514
You got something in mind?

717
00:39:06,546 --> 00:39:10,085
Yeah, but you're not
gonna like it.

718
00:39:15,526 --> 00:39:18,329
Great, it's Mr. Barbecue
again, wonderful.

719
00:39:18,362 --> 00:39:20,598
Wherever it is, I'm gonna
like it a lot more than here.

720
00:39:20,632 --> 00:39:21,667
Drive.

721
00:39:47,768 --> 00:39:49,437
Christ,
it's a madhouse out here!

722
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,307
My God, there are monsters
all over Hollywood!

723
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,009
It's not much different
than usual, then.

724
00:39:54,043 --> 00:39:55,746
If I said
that we've got company,

725
00:39:55,778 --> 00:39:57,681
would that be too cliché?

726
00:39:59,784 --> 00:40:01,620
Candice, you're probably
a good driver and all,

727
00:40:01,653 --> 00:40:05,192
but now would be a good time
to exceed posted speed limits.

728
00:40:05,225 --> 00:40:06,460
Hold on to something!

729
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:15,605
-The freeway?
-Are you insane?

730
00:40:15,637 --> 00:40:17,072
It's the fastest way.

731
00:40:17,105 --> 00:40:18,641
Yeah, yeah, fastest way
to sudden death.

732
00:40:18,674 --> 00:40:21,380
-We have to get downtown.
-Why are we taking the freeway?

733
00:40:21,413 --> 00:40:22,681
Why would anyone
take the freeway?

734
00:40:22,713 --> 00:40:24,417
Shut up and let me drive!

735
00:40:39,502 --> 00:40:41,071
It's still behind us.

736
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,575
Jesus, just the one?

737
00:40:46,711 --> 00:40:49,082
-Not anymore.
-Great, great.

738
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:50,717
We get stuck here
and we're dead.

739
00:41:00,262 --> 00:41:02,700
I am not dying on my day off!

740
00:41:13,681 --> 00:41:15,216
Damn!

741
00:41:15,249 --> 00:41:16,284
My God.

742
00:41:18,688 --> 00:41:20,691
My God. My God.

743
00:41:22,825 --> 00:41:24,495
Today was supposed
to be a spa day.

744
00:41:24,529 --> 00:41:26,398
-What?
-Up here. Up here.

745
00:41:26,432 --> 00:41:28,200
-Take the next exit.
-Jonas, shut up.

746
00:41:28,233 --> 00:41:30,103
All right, Candice,
you stay on this road.

747
00:41:30,136 --> 00:41:31,671
Do I get a say in any of this?

748
00:41:31,705 --> 00:41:32,841
No!

749
00:41:32,874 --> 00:41:34,342
But if you want
to start praying,

750
00:41:34,374 --> 00:41:35,677
now would be a good time.

751
00:41:50,296 --> 00:41:52,132
-Candice, do you mind?
-What are you doing?

752
00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:53,835
No!
Yes, do it! Do it!

753
00:42:02,445 --> 00:42:03,881
No, they're coming back!

754
00:42:03,914 --> 00:42:05,217
Everybody get down!

755
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,395
They think we're one of them.

756
00:42:15,429 --> 00:42:16,564
What?

757
00:42:16,597 --> 00:42:17,666
They can't tell that it's dead.

758
00:42:17,698 --> 00:42:18,800
They think we're one of them.

759
00:42:20,503 --> 00:42:21,371
Camouflage.

760
00:42:23,506 --> 00:42:26,243
Well, if we're gonna
be attacked by monsters,

761
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:28,480
I'm sure glad
they're dumb as shit.

762
00:42:28,513 --> 00:42:31,918
My God. My God.
My God.

763
00:43:10,702 --> 00:43:13,273
This is
your idea of safe?

764
00:43:13,305 --> 00:43:15,741
Yeah, do people still get mugged
during times of crisis?

765
00:43:15,774 --> 00:43:17,777
No.

766
00:43:17,811 --> 00:43:19,313
Wait, wait. Do they?

767
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,915
Come on.

768
00:43:20,948 --> 00:43:22,517
What?

769
00:43:26,689 --> 00:43:28,626
-Whose place is this?
-I don't know, dude.

770
00:43:28,658 --> 00:43:29,927
Let's just say
I've been handed this address

771
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,729
enough to know it by heart,

772
00:43:31,763 --> 00:43:33,466
even if I didn't want to.

773
00:43:33,499 --> 00:43:34,834
This isn't a drug dealer's
place, right?

774
00:43:34,867 --> 00:43:36,536
No, worse.

775
00:43:37,971 --> 00:43:39,907
-Your boyfriend's?
-I don't have one.

776
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,542
-And I wouldn't bring...
-What?

777
00:43:42,843 --> 00:43:44,647
The sexy little spitfire
from the bar

778
00:43:44,681 --> 00:43:46,916
come to see old Sampson,
did ya?

779
00:43:46,949 --> 00:43:48,718
Glad to see ya came
to your senses.

780
00:43:48,752 --> 00:43:50,922
And you brought company.

781
00:43:54,058 --> 00:43:57,830
Well, haven't played
for that team in quite a while.

782
00:43:57,864 --> 00:43:59,366
Well.

783
00:43:59,398 --> 00:44:01,503
More, the merrier,
I always say.

784
00:44:03,739 --> 00:44:06,309
What the fuck is that?

785
00:44:06,341 --> 00:44:08,778
So...

786
00:44:08,811 --> 00:44:10,914
you slew a dragon.

787
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:12,616
It's not a dragon.

788
00:44:12,649 --> 00:44:14,385
It's a pterodactyl.

789
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:15,753
Ptero-what?

790
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:17,857
Is that scientific for dragon?

791
00:44:19,425 --> 00:44:20,661
No.

792
00:44:22,897 --> 00:44:24,700
The great hunter.

793
00:44:24,733 --> 00:44:27,069
Yeah. Surprised?

794
00:44:28,069 --> 00:44:29,773
Are you sure it's dead?

795
00:44:29,805 --> 00:44:31,441
It's dead, all right.

796
00:44:31,474 --> 00:44:33,644
That's the second one
I've killed today.

797
00:44:37,014 --> 00:44:38,518
It is now.

798
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:43,624
What are
ancient flying reptiles

799
00:44:43,657 --> 00:44:46,495
doing in Los Angeles
of all places?

800
00:44:49,998 --> 00:44:53,839
I used to do this guy
who did promotions for movies.

801
00:44:53,871 --> 00:44:56,375
Maybe it's something like that.
Yeah?

802
00:44:56,407 --> 00:45:02,516
They've been dead
for over 65 million years!

803
00:45:02,549 --> 00:45:04,385
And how do you know all this?

804
00:45:04,418 --> 00:45:05,552
I read.

805
00:45:05,586 --> 00:45:07,422
You know, books.

806
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,424
She's kind of a nerd.

807
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:11,661
Nerds.

808
00:45:11,693 --> 00:45:15,600
I used to shove nerds
into lockers in high school,

809
00:45:15,633 --> 00:45:19,472
trunks in cars, toilets,
walls, concrete floors.

810
00:45:19,504 --> 00:45:21,106
You name it.

811
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,710
How am I a nerd?

812
00:45:22,742 --> 00:45:24,911
Come on, you take over the DVR

813
00:45:24,945 --> 00:45:26,948
with your
Discovery Channel crap.

814
00:45:26,981 --> 00:45:28,618
I-I kind of like nerds.

815
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:30,485
And you boil leaves
in your coffee.

816
00:45:30,518 --> 00:45:32,956
-It's really weird.
-It's called a French press.

817
00:45:32,988 --> 00:45:34,859
Val, I taught you
how to use it last week.

818
00:45:34,891 --> 00:45:37,796
-It's still weird.
-I'm weird? What about you?

819
00:45:37,829 --> 00:45:40,165
You drink vodka
first thing every morning.

820
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:41,567
Hey, I drink it
with orange juice.

821
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,938
All right, enough! Look.

822
00:45:44,972 --> 00:45:46,474
What I want to know is,

823
00:45:46,507 --> 00:45:47,843
where the hell
is the damn military?

824
00:45:47,875 --> 00:45:49,977
-Yeah.
-You know, the tanks, the jets.

825
00:45:50,011 --> 00:45:51,881
All that crap our taxes pay for.

826
00:45:51,913 --> 00:45:54,684
That right there, I just might
have an answer for ya.

827
00:46:02,628 --> 00:46:04,498
That looks like military.

828
00:46:04,531 --> 00:46:06,133
Where the hell did you
dig that up?

829
00:46:06,166 --> 00:46:08,168
Well, let's just say
when I left the marines,

830
00:46:08,202 --> 00:46:10,973
I took a few souvenirs.

831
00:46:11,006 --> 00:46:14,577
Yeah, speaking of which,
how did you leave the marines?

832
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:16,480
Well, you know
how alcohol explodes

833
00:46:16,513 --> 00:46:19,183
when it's stored
next to gasoline?

834
00:46:19,217 --> 00:46:21,653
No.

835
00:46:21,686 --> 00:46:24,057
Well, it does.
Quite a lot.

836
00:46:24,089 --> 00:46:27,161
Fortunately I've still got
some friends at Vandenberg.

837
00:46:27,194 --> 00:46:29,196
Marines never forget their own.

838
00:46:29,229 --> 00:46:30,764
Yeah, this guy's got
a lot of friends.

839
00:46:30,798 --> 00:46:32,534
Vandenberg Alpha,
this is Lone Hunter.

840
00:46:32,567 --> 00:46:33,870
Do you copy?

841
00:46:33,902 --> 00:46:35,171
You sure that thing still works?

842
00:46:37,173 --> 00:46:39,777
I repeat, Vandenberg Alpha,
this is Lone Hunter.

843
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:41,113
Do you copy?

844
00:46:41,146 --> 00:46:42,548
It's probably not even
plugged in.

845
00:46:42,581 --> 00:46:44,683
Please.

846
00:46:44,716 --> 00:46:45,985
Waste of time.

847
00:46:46,018 --> 00:46:48,556
Vandenberg Alpha,
this is Lone Hunter.

848
00:46:48,588 --> 00:46:50,225
Do you copy?

849
00:46:50,258 --> 00:46:52,060
Anyone who can get this,
we are under attack.

850
00:46:52,093 --> 00:46:53,530
I repeat,
we are under attack.

851
00:46:53,563 --> 00:46:55,031
Monsters coming from the sky.

852
00:46:55,063 --> 00:46:57,133
Too many to count.
We're getting slaughtered!

853
00:46:57,167 --> 00:46:58,969
Wait. What's that?

854
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:01,772
It's enormous!

855
00:47:01,806 --> 00:47:04,075
Send everything you've got!
Send...

856
00:47:04,108 --> 00:47:05,110
Shit.

857
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:12,654
This is worse than I thought.

858
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,896
Now I'm sober.

859
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:22,000
No, no, no, no, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

860
00:47:22,032 --> 00:47:24,101
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
these things, these things,

861
00:47:24,134 --> 00:47:25,338
they were extinct before, right?

862
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:26,638
-Yeah.
-Okay.

863
00:47:26,671 --> 00:47:28,174
Okay, so all we need to do

864
00:47:28,208 --> 00:47:29,777
is just, you know...
We'll figure out

865
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:31,680
what killed them all off
last time,

866
00:47:31,713 --> 00:47:33,314
and, you know,
we'll do that again.

867
00:47:33,347 --> 00:47:34,917
-Dude.
-Yeah.

868
00:47:34,949 --> 00:47:37,286
Jonas, they were killed

869
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:41,793
by a giant meteor
65 million years ago.

870
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:43,361
Am I the only person
that knows this?

871
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:45,264
-What I don't get is...
-I'm in science class.

872
00:47:45,297 --> 00:47:48,133
These pterodactyls, right,
they just happen to show up now?

873
00:47:48,167 --> 00:47:51,072
Maybe they've been
waiting all this time,

874
00:47:51,105 --> 00:47:52,841
just now hatching
from their eggs.

875
00:47:52,874 --> 00:47:54,276
I-I don't know.

876
00:47:54,309 --> 00:47:56,311
Yeah, well, how are
there so many eggs?

877
00:47:56,344 --> 00:47:58,880
I mean, is there some giant
dactyl just laying these things,

878
00:47:58,913 --> 00:48:00,783
like, on a big conveyor belt,
you know?

879
00:48:00,816 --> 00:48:04,688
But here's the other question.
How are they making eggs?

880
00:48:04,721 --> 00:48:07,125
Good question!
Nobody's yelling at him.

881
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:10,129
Maybe you're just
all wrong.

882
00:48:12,298 --> 00:48:14,635
Maybe your ancient
massive meteor

883
00:48:14,668 --> 00:48:16,938
didn't kill 'em after all.

884
00:48:16,971 --> 00:48:18,708
Maybe it just flung 'em

885
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:22,379
out into the cold, dark
infinite of space.

886
00:48:22,412 --> 00:48:25,249
And that's where they stayed.

887
00:48:25,282 --> 00:48:28,988
Circling around in the void,
biding their time.

888
00:48:29,021 --> 00:48:32,159
Getting more and more
pissed off.

889
00:48:33,961 --> 00:48:36,966
And now they've returned
with a vengeance.

890
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:43,140
Maybe they just want
their home back.

891
00:48:43,174 --> 00:48:46,143
Our home.

892
00:48:46,176 --> 00:48:49,280
Maybe what they really want
is our freedom.

893
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:55,724
Maybe they're just
itching for a fight!

894
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:03,733
Yeah.

895
00:49:03,767 --> 00:49:07,272
Okay, okay, so,
assuming nobody here

896
00:49:07,304 --> 00:49:11,309
in this room has a giant
meteorite somewhere,

897
00:49:11,342 --> 00:49:14,915
what's plan B?

898
00:49:17,383 --> 00:49:19,055
Bullets.

899
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:29,034
Yes!

900
00:49:29,067 --> 00:49:30,503
Dude, it looks like
Rambo in there.

901
00:49:30,535 --> 00:49:32,003
Guns.

902
00:49:32,037 --> 00:49:34,775
Freedom you can
hold in your hand.

903
00:49:34,808 --> 00:49:37,011
Is that a bomb?

904
00:49:37,043 --> 00:49:38,078
Yeah.

905
00:49:38,112 --> 00:49:40,116
Forgot I even had that thing.

906
00:49:40,149 --> 00:49:42,952
Parting gift
from an old girlfriend.

907
00:49:42,985 --> 00:49:45,121
Navy SEAL, sweet lass.

908
00:49:45,155 --> 00:49:47,424
Sweet ass too.

909
00:49:47,457 --> 00:49:49,327
Isn't that dangerous?

910
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,762
Yeah.

911
00:49:50,795 --> 00:49:51,996
Never sleep with a woman

912
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,767
who has a shiv in her bra.

913
00:49:53,799 --> 00:49:56,402
Hey.

914
00:49:56,436 --> 00:49:57,972
Those'll cost you, sweet cheeks.

915
00:49:58,005 --> 00:50:00,975
What was all that BS
about freedom just now?

916
00:50:01,008 --> 00:50:03,513
Well, freedom's free.
The guns ain't.

917
00:50:05,414 --> 00:50:08,152
Does it look like
we grabbed cash this morning?

918
00:50:08,185 --> 00:50:09,920
How are we supposed to pay you?

919
00:50:18,364 --> 00:50:20,267
-No way.
-Dude, dude.

920
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,236
We divided this up enough.

921
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:23,539
Dude, Lars,

922
00:50:23,571 --> 00:50:25,007
we need weapons.

923
00:50:25,041 --> 00:50:28,012
Yeah, and I need a new truck.

924
00:50:28,044 --> 00:50:29,113
Just don't...

925
00:50:29,146 --> 00:50:30,382
Truck, weapons.

926
00:50:30,415 --> 00:50:32,083
All right, fine.

927
00:50:35,454 --> 00:50:37,857
What do you want?

928
00:50:37,891 --> 00:50:39,460
I want the dragon.

929
00:50:39,492 --> 00:50:40,394
The pterodactyl?

930
00:50:40,427 --> 00:50:41,395
Yeah.

931
00:50:41,429 --> 00:50:42,897
You didn't kill it.

932
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:45,333
So? And Columbus
didn't discover America.

933
00:50:45,366 --> 00:50:47,837
-Pfft!
-Dude, come on.

934
00:50:47,871 --> 00:50:50,241
Do we have a deal?

935
00:50:50,274 --> 00:50:51,943
-Seriously?
-Who cares?

936
00:50:51,976 --> 00:50:53,478
Jonas, yeah.

937
00:50:58,149 --> 00:51:00,821
Now, who's gonna help me
move this thing?

938
00:51:14,273 --> 00:51:16,041
You ever fire one of these?

939
00:51:16,074 --> 00:51:18,044
Only when I was a kid.

940
00:51:18,076 --> 00:51:19,345
You?

941
00:51:19,379 --> 00:51:21,883
No, Mom didn't
believe in guns.

942
00:51:21,916 --> 00:51:24,052
Said I could build
my own, though.

943
00:51:24,084 --> 00:51:26,488
-Did you?
-Yeah.

944
00:51:26,522 --> 00:51:29,391
Turns out dried cow shit
makes great gunpowder.

945
00:51:29,424 --> 00:51:31,561
Nice.

946
00:51:31,595 --> 00:51:35,367
That just might be a little
bit too dangerous for a...

947
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,936
What? A woman?

948
00:51:44,577 --> 00:51:46,614
What other surprises you hiding?

949
00:51:46,647 --> 00:51:48,316
I wasn't always a bartender.

950
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:50,287
Do tell.

951
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:54,357
Maybe later when there aren't
man-eating reptile everywhere!

952
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:58,030
Yeah? Yeah.

953
00:51:58,064 --> 00:52:00,033
I think I need to teach you
how to hold a gun.

954
00:52:02,101 --> 00:52:03,404
Or shoot one.

955
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,210
-The hell no.
-Hey!

956
00:52:09,243 --> 00:52:11,213
Val, in this case,
I think it might be

957
00:52:11,246 --> 00:52:13,449
too dangerous for a woman
to have a gun.

958
00:52:13,483 --> 00:52:15,152
Fine.

959
00:52:15,185 --> 00:52:17,522
Then I'll just go find
my own weapon,

960
00:52:17,556 --> 00:52:20,627
like a sword

961
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:22,261
or some scissors.

962
00:52:34,144 --> 00:52:35,012
Got it.

963
00:52:47,594 --> 00:52:50,765
All right, so this
is the tricky part.

964
00:52:50,799 --> 00:52:55,306
Once this mainspring is in,
sits right there,

965
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:58,176
then this can slide
the rest of the way.

966
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:00,177
See here?

967
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:03,181
You're really good
with your hands.

968
00:53:03,215 --> 00:53:05,051
I'm sorry. Sorry...

969
00:53:13,294 --> 00:53:16,165
Scary day, right?

970
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:17,734
Nah.

971
00:53:17,767 --> 00:53:19,036
They're just big animals.

972
00:53:19,069 --> 00:53:20,706
You know, just teeth and claws.

973
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:23,042
Nothing really to be afraid of.

974
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:26,079
They've killed
thousands of people.

975
00:53:26,112 --> 00:53:27,213
Right, exactly.

976
00:53:27,246 --> 00:53:30,284
So we need to even the score.

977
00:53:33,422 --> 00:53:36,193
Nothing fazes you, does it?

978
00:53:36,226 --> 00:53:38,262
Nope, nothing... nothing at all.

979
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:42,133
Really.

980
00:53:42,166 --> 00:53:43,235
All right.

981
00:53:44,635 --> 00:53:46,239
Try sliding that in.

982
00:53:48,342 --> 00:53:49,244
Okay.

983
00:53:55,518 --> 00:53:56,485
Like this?

984
00:53:59,522 --> 00:54:01,493
Dang it. Sorry. Sorry.

985
00:54:01,525 --> 00:54:03,427
Brave monster slayer?

986
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:06,732
Yeah, well, monsters are easy.

987
00:54:06,766 --> 00:54:10,872
And women are complicated?

988
00:54:10,905 --> 00:54:14,877
Look, I just... I suck at
sweeping women off their feet.

989
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:17,614
We don't want to be
swept off of our feet.

990
00:54:17,646 --> 00:54:20,417
We want someone
who can keep us on our feet.

991
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:23,688
Yeah, well, not every woman
is like you.

992
00:54:26,492 --> 00:54:28,662
Sounds like
it's getting personal.

993
00:54:30,264 --> 00:54:31,867
You know, I keep getting told

994
00:54:31,899 --> 00:54:36,272
that I just don't
get personal enough.

995
00:54:37,272 --> 00:54:38,741
Damn it.

996
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:39,776
Here.

997
00:54:43,748 --> 00:54:46,519
You know, when I was
a little girl,

998
00:54:46,552 --> 00:54:49,788
I kept being afraid
of monsters in my closet.

999
00:54:49,821 --> 00:54:51,791
Couldn't get out of bed,

1000
00:54:51,824 --> 00:54:54,129
go to the bathroom, nothing.

1001
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:56,765
You go running
into your parents' room?

1002
00:54:56,798 --> 00:54:59,435
Nah, my dad
wasn't the kind to say,

1003
00:54:59,467 --> 00:55:02,505
"Don't be scared.
They ain't real."

1004
00:55:02,539 --> 00:55:06,210
Instead, he'd tell me
to toughen up.

1005
00:55:06,243 --> 00:55:07,813
Show 'em how to be scared.

1006
00:55:09,215 --> 00:55:10,351
That work?

1007
00:55:11,917 --> 00:55:13,387
Eventually.

1008
00:55:13,421 --> 00:55:16,625
One day, I just had
enough, you know?

1009
00:55:16,658 --> 00:55:18,560
I just marched
right up to that closet,

1010
00:55:18,593 --> 00:55:23,400
opened the door, and saw
there was nothing there.

1011
00:55:23,433 --> 00:55:25,904
I was afraid of nothing.

1012
00:55:27,771 --> 00:55:29,876
I just needed to face it
and figure it out.

1013
00:55:31,443 --> 00:55:33,379
Your dad sounds pretty smart.

1014
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,514
Yeah.

1015
00:55:36,783 --> 00:55:38,754
He also gave me
a nine-millimeter

1016
00:55:38,786 --> 00:55:41,691
for my tenth birthday.

1017
00:55:41,724 --> 00:55:43,927
So that definitely helped too.

1018
00:55:45,263 --> 00:55:47,400
Dad was big on self-reliance.

1019
00:55:51,703 --> 00:55:52,972
Could I try again?

1020
00:56:05,888 --> 00:56:07,592
Ain't so scary now.

1021
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:12,799
That was good.

1022
00:56:14,701 --> 00:56:15,570
You got it.

1023
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:24,881
Is anyone there?

1024
00:56:24,913 --> 00:56:27,918
No, nada,
zip, zilch, nothing!

1025
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,324
It's like end
of the world around here.

1026
00:56:34,493 --> 00:56:35,862
You could say that again.

1027
00:56:35,895 --> 00:56:37,832
Almost out of scotch.

1028
00:56:41,536 --> 00:56:44,041
So about the guns...

1029
00:56:44,074 --> 00:56:46,944
Hey, fair trade for fair trade.

1030
00:56:46,977 --> 00:56:49,013
I'm not the government.
I'm not a charity.

1031
00:56:49,046 --> 00:56:50,815
I'm military.

1032
00:57:33,404 --> 00:57:36,808
You know,
it's times like these

1033
00:57:36,841 --> 00:57:40,782
that really make a girl
think about what she wants.

1034
00:57:40,814 --> 00:57:42,751
Yeah,

1035
00:57:44,051 --> 00:57:49,759
And you know
what I want

1036
00:57:49,794 --> 00:57:55,434
more than a big strong man
to protect me?

1037
00:57:58,703 --> 00:58:02,910
You must have so many guns

1038
00:58:02,943 --> 00:58:07,850
just begging to be used.

1039
00:58:07,882 --> 00:58:14,558
So you think you could
loan me just one?

1040
00:58:15,994 --> 00:58:19,966
Yeah, I'm certain we can
come up with something.

1041
00:58:19,999 --> 00:58:22,570
So what'll I get, a rifle

1042
00:58:22,603 --> 00:58:24,606
or a pistol

1043
00:58:24,638 --> 00:58:28,978
or a bazooka?

1044
00:58:30,881 --> 00:58:31,883
What's wrong?

1045
00:58:35,819 --> 00:58:37,122
Shit.

1046
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,095
No, no!

1047
00:58:52,843 --> 00:58:55,480
You reptilian asshole.

1048
00:58:55,513 --> 00:58:58,984
I was about to get laid.
It's been years.

1049
00:58:59,017 --> 00:59:02,055
It's been years,
you son of a bitch!

1050
00:59:02,089 --> 00:59:04,558
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1051
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:05,461
Out of the way!

1052
00:59:25,786 --> 00:59:26,855
Shit.

1053
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:35,665
Maybe Sampson got away.

1054
00:59:35,698 --> 00:59:38,770
You know,
he could've survived.

1055
00:59:40,338 --> 00:59:42,007
Here's his flask.

1056
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:46,715
Shit.

1057
01:00:16,151 --> 01:00:18,122
How did it find us?

1058
01:00:18,154 --> 01:00:19,691
I mean, they're just animals.

1059
01:00:19,723 --> 01:00:20,858
How the hell
can something like that

1060
01:00:20,891 --> 01:00:22,260
track us across
a whole damn city?

1061
01:00:22,293 --> 01:00:23,863
I don't know.

1062
01:00:29,069 --> 01:00:31,872
Wait a minute.
I think I do know.

1063
01:00:31,905 --> 01:00:34,042
It's this thing.

1064
01:00:34,076 --> 01:00:35,177
What do you mean?

1065
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:36,613
Dude, think about it.

1066
01:00:36,646 --> 01:00:38,081
The minute we picked up
this rock,

1067
01:00:38,115 --> 01:00:39,951
those things have been on us
like fleas on a dog.

1068
01:00:39,984 --> 01:00:41,786
They want the rock back.

1069
01:00:41,819 --> 01:00:43,222
But that's our cash crop.

1070
01:00:43,255 --> 01:00:44,923
We can't just
throw it away, man.

1071
01:00:44,956 --> 01:00:46,692
I mean what about the business?
What about your truck?

1072
01:00:46,725 --> 01:00:48,628
It doesn't matter
if we're already dead.

1073
01:00:48,661 --> 01:00:50,264
Lars, keep your voice down.

1074
01:00:50,297 --> 01:00:51,699
No, I will not.

1075
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:53,202
Just think about it
for a second.

1076
01:00:53,234 --> 01:00:55,270
This whole damn thing
wouldn't have happened

1077
01:00:55,304 --> 01:00:58,975
if Romeo here hadn't talked us
into going along

1078
01:00:59,008 --> 01:01:01,178
on this prehistoric
joyride through hell.

1079
01:01:02,179 --> 01:01:03,815
Christ, Jonas, I mean,

1080
01:01:03,848 --> 01:01:05,218
people are getting killed
over this thing.

1081
01:01:05,251 --> 01:01:06,852
So it's all my fault now.

1082
01:01:06,885 --> 01:01:08,421
Yes, it goddamn is.

1083
01:01:08,455 --> 01:01:10,959
The same as it's been, what,
the last dozen times

1084
01:01:10,992 --> 01:01:12,760
I've gone along
with one of your schemes?

1085
01:01:12,793 --> 01:01:14,229
-Hey!
-Guys...

1086
01:01:14,263 --> 01:01:16,031
Just because you don't
want to dream, man,

1087
01:01:16,065 --> 01:01:17,834
don't try to bring me down
because I've got one.

1088
01:01:17,867 --> 01:01:20,304
Your dream
is my nightmare, okay?

1089
01:01:20,337 --> 01:01:22,040
And this one's
gonna end up with us

1090
01:01:22,073 --> 01:01:24,309
up to our necks
in prehistoric pigeons!

1091
01:01:25,309 --> 01:01:26,745
Guys!

1092
01:01:26,778 --> 01:01:28,180
Can you work this out
some other time?

1093
01:01:36,424 --> 01:01:38,226
Looks like
the bullet theory works.

1094
01:01:38,259 --> 01:01:39,796
Jesus.

1095
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:41,130
How about you guys
stow your drama,

1096
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:42,801
drop your dicks,
pick up your guns,

1097
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:44,902
and kill some reptile?

1098
01:01:52,012 --> 01:01:55,418
Move, move, move, move, move.

1099
01:01:58,286 --> 01:02:00,122
Well, this is a fine mess.

1100
01:02:03,794 --> 01:02:06,764
This is not my fault.

1101
01:02:12,138 --> 01:02:13,106
Yeah?

1102
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:14,409
Well, this is the kind of thing

1103
01:02:14,441 --> 01:02:16,210
your schemes always get us into.

1104
01:02:16,244 --> 01:02:18,047
My schemes?
My schemes?

1105
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:24,822
When have my schemes ever gotten
us into anything like this?

1106
01:02:24,854 --> 01:02:26,458
Guys, will you shut up
and shoot something?

1107
01:02:30,963 --> 01:02:32,165
This is crazy!

1108
01:02:32,198 --> 01:02:33,501
They're like a goddamn army!

1109
01:02:47,384 --> 01:02:49,889
Why are you laughing?

1110
01:02:49,921 --> 01:02:51,959
Dude, I just took out,
like, four of them.

1111
01:02:53,926 --> 01:02:55,029
Well, keep it up!

1112
01:03:19,861 --> 01:03:21,363
All right!

1113
01:03:21,395 --> 01:03:23,099
We got them on the run!

1114
01:03:32,143 --> 01:03:34,147
Shit.

1115
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:41,423
Nice shot.

1116
01:03:41,456 --> 01:03:43,426
Goddamn, I'm happy to see you.

1117
01:03:43,458 --> 01:03:46,295
Don't be too happy.
I'm all out of bullets.

1118
01:03:46,329 --> 01:03:47,898
Well, shit,
let's stock up, then.

1119
01:03:47,931 --> 01:03:49,600
And get the hell
out of dodge.

1120
01:03:49,634 --> 01:03:51,403
There's got to be somewhere
where these things ain't.

1121
01:03:53,905 --> 01:03:56,042
I locked one in the armory.

1122
01:03:56,075 --> 01:03:58,179
Just one?

1123
01:03:58,212 --> 01:03:59,480
That ain't so bad.

1124
01:04:03,350 --> 01:04:05,120
God damn it.

1125
01:04:18,971 --> 01:04:19,641
You okay?

1126
01:04:21,275 --> 01:04:23,312
What a goddamn horrible day.

1127
01:04:25,147 --> 01:04:26,916
Jesus.

1128
01:04:28,016 --> 01:04:31,054
What?

1129
01:04:31,055 --> 01:04:31,991
Barbecue.

1130
01:04:35,593 --> 01:04:37,429
God, how hard is it
to kill this asshole?

1131
01:04:45,373 --> 01:04:46,576
Hey, you oversized iguana!

1132
01:04:51,082 --> 01:04:53,118
Goddamn, that's hard to throw.

1133
01:04:57,756 --> 01:04:58,991
Crap.

1134
01:04:59,024 --> 01:05:00,261
Lars!

1135
01:05:03,698 --> 01:05:04,599
-Lars, no!
-Lars!

1136
01:05:04,631 --> 01:05:06,033
Help!

1137
01:05:06,066 --> 01:05:07,536
Put me down! Put me down!
Jonas!

1138
01:05:07,569 --> 01:05:11,074
-God, I'm gonna kill you!
-No, no, no, no!

1139
01:05:11,108 --> 01:05:12,176
What do you mean no?

1140
01:05:12,209 --> 01:05:13,311
Let's go after him!

1141
01:05:13,344 --> 01:05:15,347
Come on!

1142
01:05:15,379 --> 01:05:18,617
Put me down!

1143
01:05:20,754 --> 01:05:22,122
Come on!

1144
01:05:22,154 --> 01:05:23,057
Where is he?

1145
01:05:27,595 --> 01:05:28,764
God damn it!

1146
01:05:28,797 --> 01:05:30,232
There! Come on!

1147
01:05:30,266 --> 01:05:32,002
God damn it, Jonas!

1148
01:05:34,071 --> 01:05:35,340
Come on!

1149
01:05:35,373 --> 01:05:37,376
-Lars!
-Jonas!

1150
01:05:37,409 --> 01:05:38,778
Put me down.

1151
01:05:38,811 --> 01:05:40,412
No, on second thought,
don't put me down.

1152
01:05:42,149 --> 01:05:45,153
You stupid lizard,
bird, reptile.

1153
01:05:47,188 --> 01:05:49,591
Jesus, look at this.

1154
01:05:49,625 --> 01:05:51,595
It's a slaughterhouse.

1155
01:05:51,628 --> 01:05:54,632
I mean, where's the police,
the national guard, anyone?

1156
01:05:54,665 --> 01:05:56,567
Anyone who's smart's
hiding right now.

1157
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:58,604
Yeah, what does that make us?

1158
01:05:58,637 --> 01:06:01,274
Jonas! God damn it.

1159
01:06:01,307 --> 01:06:04,311
-Come on, this way, come on.
-God damn it!

1160
01:06:14,523 --> 01:06:16,493
I'll be there this sunday,

1161
01:06:16,527 --> 01:06:18,263
'cause I'm kill Jonas,
and it's gonna be his funeral.

1162
01:06:18,295 --> 01:06:19,664
Jonas!

1163
01:06:19,697 --> 01:06:20,598
Through here. Through here.

1164
01:06:20,632 --> 01:06:21,633
Come on, come on!

1165
01:06:32,281 --> 01:06:33,616
Get down. Get down. Get down.

1166
01:06:45,765 --> 01:06:47,601
It's coming. It's coming.

1167
01:06:51,473 --> 01:06:52,675
It's coming.

1168
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,548
What's that sound?

1169
01:07:03,356 --> 01:07:04,691
A swarm!

1170
01:07:21,478 --> 01:07:22,347
Sorry.

1171
01:07:26,352 --> 01:07:27,754
God damn it!

1172
01:07:27,787 --> 01:07:28,789
Lars.

1173
01:07:28,822 --> 01:07:30,458
Come on.

1174
01:07:30,491 --> 01:07:33,495
God, this is worse
than flying into LAX.

1175
01:07:33,528 --> 01:07:35,732
-Come on.
-I'm coming.

1176
01:07:38,602 --> 01:07:39,570
Did we lose him?

1177
01:07:39,602 --> 01:07:40,605
I don't know.

1178
01:07:42,806 --> 01:07:44,510
God damn it!

1179
01:07:44,543 --> 01:07:46,646
Not as long as he's
got air in his lungs

1180
01:07:46,679 --> 01:07:47,681
and curses on his tongue.

1181
01:07:47,714 --> 01:07:49,183
Come on!

1182
01:07:49,216 --> 01:07:50,719
Jonas,
I'm gonna kill you!

1183
01:07:55,424 --> 01:07:56,927
-Christ on a stick!
-No!

1184
01:08:01,665 --> 01:08:04,636
That's got to be their nest.

1185
01:08:04,668 --> 01:08:07,206
Jonas, we can't just go
cowboying into there.

1186
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:08,508
We can't just
leave him in there.

1187
01:08:08,541 --> 01:08:10,210
They're gonna
tear him to shreds.

1188
01:08:10,243 --> 01:08:12,447
If we go in there,
they'll tear us to shreds.

1189
01:08:15,416 --> 01:08:16,652
I got him into this.

1190
01:08:18,454 --> 01:08:20,957
That's Lars up there,

1191
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:23,395
and I'm gonna
do something about it.

1192
01:08:39,749 --> 01:08:42,620
What kind of hangover is this?

1193
01:08:43,821 --> 01:08:46,559
What the...

1194
01:08:46,591 --> 01:08:47,893
Hey there, Barbecue.

1195
01:08:49,461 --> 01:08:51,531
Take it easy.

1196
01:08:51,564 --> 01:08:54,402
Hope you're still not sore
about, you know...

1197
01:08:55,635 --> 01:08:57,572
It's not as bad
as what Jonas did.

1198
01:08:57,606 --> 01:09:00,476
I mean, he burned your face off.

1199
01:09:04,748 --> 01:09:05,618
What?

1200
01:09:07,886 --> 01:09:09,022
God damn it.

1201
01:09:09,054 --> 01:09:10,455
God damn it.

1202
01:09:10,488 --> 01:09:12,460
God damn it!

1203
01:09:26,077 --> 01:09:27,713
I'll be damned.

1204
01:09:34,588 --> 01:09:36,957
Those weren't no meteorites.

1205
01:09:36,991 --> 01:09:38,294
They were eggs.

1206
01:09:40,763 --> 01:09:43,867
They were you
falling from the sky.

1207
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:45,870
My God.

1208
01:09:53,746 --> 01:09:54,681
Yes.

1209
01:09:58,519 --> 01:09:59,722
What are we doing back here?

1210
01:09:59,754 --> 01:10:00,855
I thought you
wanted to help him.

1211
01:10:00,888 --> 01:10:02,459
I am.

1212
01:10:02,491 --> 01:10:05,562
Jonas, we need to call
the cops, the military,

1213
01:10:05,595 --> 01:10:07,098
somebody who knows
what they're doing.

1214
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:09,033
Have you seen any cops lately?

1215
01:10:09,067 --> 01:10:11,036
And we know what happened
to the military.

1216
01:10:11,068 --> 01:10:13,139
Jonas, it's suicide.

1217
01:10:13,172 --> 01:10:15,343
You go back in there,
you're not coming back out.

1218
01:10:17,043 --> 01:10:19,447
Damn it, Jonas,
you can't do this.

1219
01:10:19,479 --> 01:10:23,585
I don't want you
to die before I...

1220
01:10:23,618 --> 01:10:25,055
Before what?

1221
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:30,428
Before I get the chance
to really know you.

1222
01:10:33,599 --> 01:10:37,104
I spent my entire life
making nothing of myself.

1223
01:10:37,136 --> 01:10:40,542
Just making things.

1224
01:10:40,574 --> 01:10:43,078
I thought being clever
was enough, but it ain't.

1225
01:10:44,146 --> 01:10:45,548
I can't just let him sit there.

1226
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:47,651
I've got to do something.

1227
01:10:49,854 --> 01:10:51,523
I owe him that.

1228
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:55,861
Well, if that's
how it's gonna be,

1229
01:10:55,895 --> 01:10:59,733
then you're gonna need someone
to keep you on your feet.

1230
01:10:59,767 --> 01:11:02,104
They brought the fight to us.

1231
01:11:02,136 --> 01:11:04,774
I say we bring it back to them.

1232
01:11:04,806 --> 01:11:07,577
You sure you want to do this?

1233
01:11:07,609 --> 01:11:09,446
You think you even have
a say in that matter?

1234
01:11:13,718 --> 01:11:16,989
Those goddamn flying lizards
better watch out.

1235
01:11:17,022 --> 01:11:19,593
'Cause we're gonna
make them extinct again.

1236
01:13:01,394 --> 01:13:03,930
Hey, don't worry.

1237
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:06,767
I ain't moving
after that last hit.

1238
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:08,137
Jerk.

1239
01:13:14,778 --> 01:13:16,949
Sweet mother of God.

1240
01:13:20,184 --> 01:13:22,054
Why are you going
toward that building?

1241
01:13:43,783 --> 01:13:44,684
Hi.

1242
01:13:44,717 --> 01:13:45,853
Hey.

1243
01:13:45,886 --> 01:13:48,657
Where am I? What is happening?

1244
01:13:49,790 --> 01:13:52,127
Lars.
Lars Wales.

1245
01:13:52,161 --> 01:13:53,663
Johnny.
Johnny Dean.

1246
01:13:53,696 --> 01:13:56,233
Well, Johnny Dean,

1247
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:59,236
to answer your first question,

1248
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:02,374
we're in the middle
of a shit storm.

1249
01:14:02,406 --> 01:14:03,876
Yeah, these ugly bastards

1250
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:06,011
have taken up shop
in this apartment here,

1251
01:14:06,045 --> 01:14:09,784
which I believe belonged
to a couple of artist types.

1252
01:14:09,817 --> 01:14:11,986
I'm gonna be honest
with you, Johnny.

1253
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:14,791
I don't know a damn thing
about art.

1254
01:14:14,824 --> 01:14:17,260
But I got to say,
I mean, it's pretty good.

1255
01:14:31,846 --> 01:14:33,215
How can you stay so calm?

1256
01:14:33,247 --> 01:14:36,819
Look, there's no reason
in panicking, okay?

1257
01:14:36,853 --> 01:14:39,022
Just take it easy.

1258
01:14:39,056 --> 01:14:41,392
Come on, haven't you ever
been in a fight before?

1259
01:14:41,426 --> 01:14:45,430
All we got to do is stay calm,
look for our opening,

1260
01:14:45,464 --> 01:14:47,200
and then we give them
a real fight.

1261
01:14:47,232 --> 01:14:48,169
Bastards.

1262
01:14:50,938 --> 01:14:52,474
What are they doing now?

1263
01:14:54,476 --> 01:14:58,315
Why don't they just eat us?

1264
01:14:58,348 --> 01:15:01,419
I think that's because their
young like their food fresh.

1265
01:15:17,339 --> 01:15:20,177
You ready to do this?

1266
01:15:20,209 --> 01:15:21,944
Yeah.

1267
01:15:21,978 --> 01:15:23,914
Let's kick some past.

1268
01:15:45,042 --> 01:15:47,846
How high up did you say
that nest was?

1269
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:50,283
24th, 25th floor, probably.

1270
01:15:51,918 --> 01:15:53,320
You know, I was thinking

1271
01:15:53,352 --> 01:15:55,022
I could totally use
the exercise.

1272
01:15:57,626 --> 01:15:58,594
No?

1273
01:15:58,626 --> 01:15:59,795
Damn it.

1274
01:16:02,398 --> 01:16:03,468
Shit.

1275
01:16:13,145 --> 01:16:14,348
What's he doing?

1276
01:16:14,381 --> 01:16:16,118
Why is he looking
at me like that?

1277
01:16:17,886 --> 01:16:20,122
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, please!

1278
01:16:20,155 --> 01:16:21,924
No, take him!
Take him! No!

1279
01:16:21,958 --> 01:16:25,162
No, no, no please!

1280
01:16:25,196 --> 01:16:28,099
I pay my taxes!
I'm a good person!

1281
01:16:28,131 --> 01:16:29,836
No!

1282
01:16:39,613 --> 01:16:41,416
-Little help here.
-I'm trying.

1283
01:16:41,449 --> 01:16:44,255
I didn't really have time
to test this stuff.

1284
01:16:48,993 --> 01:16:49,962
How about that?

1285
01:16:58,972 --> 01:17:00,208
Burn that bastard!

1286
01:17:11,355 --> 01:17:13,894
God.

1287
01:17:15,293 --> 01:17:18,633
Well, that wasn't so bad.

1288
01:17:24,739 --> 01:17:27,011
You just had to say it,
didn't you?

1289
01:17:35,688 --> 01:17:39,027
You are one
big ugly mother...

1290
01:17:51,108 --> 01:17:51,977
Jonas.

1291
01:17:54,712 --> 01:17:56,216
Jonas!

1292
01:18:02,657 --> 01:18:04,560
Come on. Come on!

1293
01:18:42,476 --> 01:18:46,549
I feel like I should
say something patriotic.

1294
01:18:54,292 --> 01:18:55,160
You coming?

1295
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:08,310
Take it easy, Barbecue.
Come on, man.

1296
01:19:16,153 --> 01:19:18,190
You're awfully calm.

1297
01:19:19,591 --> 01:19:21,461
All right, fine.
This is it?

1298
01:19:21,494 --> 01:19:23,430
Come on!

1299
01:19:23,463 --> 01:19:24,833
Come on, you son of a bitch!

1300
01:19:32,442 --> 01:19:34,279
Come on! Come on, then.

1301
01:19:35,445 --> 01:19:36,781
-Lars.
-Lars.

1302
01:19:36,815 --> 01:19:37,715
Son of a...

1303
01:19:37,749 --> 01:19:38,750
Lars!

1304
01:19:38,782 --> 01:19:39,819
Jonas.

1305
01:19:57,508 --> 01:19:59,411
Take it easy, Barbecue.

1306
01:19:59,444 --> 01:20:01,681
Sorry about burning your face.

1307
01:20:05,953 --> 01:20:07,554
You're even uglier
than the big ones.

1308
01:20:07,588 --> 01:20:08,823
Lars!

1309
01:20:08,857 --> 01:20:10,792
Jonas!

1310
01:20:10,825 --> 01:20:11,728
Lars.

1311
01:20:28,448 --> 01:20:29,416
Light 'em up.

1312
01:20:46,906 --> 01:20:49,244
-Reloading.
-Got it.

1313
01:20:55,452 --> 01:20:56,119
Ready.

1314
01:20:59,990 --> 01:21:02,360
Shoot 'em! Shoot 'em all!

1315
01:21:16,611 --> 01:21:18,982
Not now. Shit.
Come on.

1316
01:21:48,321 --> 01:21:49,757
You again.

1317
01:21:51,859 --> 01:21:53,428
Back.

1318
01:21:53,461 --> 01:21:54,663
Go on.

1319
01:21:59,869 --> 01:22:00,938
Bring it.

1320
01:22:21,698 --> 01:22:24,503
All right, let's see
if you can fly.

1321
01:22:43,693 --> 01:22:45,630
Not so lazy now?

1322
01:22:51,436 --> 01:22:53,440
I'm sorry, buddy.

1323
01:22:53,472 --> 01:22:54,574
I'm glad
you didn't quit on me.

1324
01:22:54,607 --> 01:22:56,044
Never, man.

1325
01:22:56,076 --> 01:22:58,513
Was that my new leaf blower?

1326
01:23:00,482 --> 01:23:01,351
It still works.

1327
01:23:03,886 --> 01:23:06,390
Always nice to see
a little man love.

1328
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:10,630
How's it going, Lars?

1329
01:23:10,662 --> 01:23:13,800
A lot better now that
I'm no longer on the menu.

1330
01:23:15,769 --> 01:23:18,540
Crap, that's right.

1331
01:23:18,573 --> 01:23:21,744
Guys, we got bigger problems
than fishing me

1332
01:23:21,776 --> 01:23:24,615
out of a dino's
digestive tract.

1333
01:23:24,647 --> 01:23:26,683
There's your 20%.

1334
01:23:26,716 --> 01:23:29,120
They're breeding.

1335
01:23:29,153 --> 01:23:31,657
Yeah, but not here.

1336
01:23:31,689 --> 01:23:33,493
They're bringing them
from somewhere else.

1337
01:23:35,728 --> 01:23:37,697
Hey, hey, guys, guys.

1338
01:23:37,731 --> 01:23:42,038
Does that look
like Sampson to you?

1339
01:23:42,070 --> 01:23:43,439
Looks like he wasn't

1340
01:23:43,473 --> 01:23:45,042
the only one
that collected trophies.

1341
01:23:45,074 --> 01:23:46,910
-What?
-Poor bastard.

1342
01:23:46,944 --> 01:23:48,813
What a way to go.

1343
01:23:51,683 --> 01:23:53,619
What is that?

1344
01:23:53,652 --> 01:23:55,589
Where am I?

1345
01:23:55,621 --> 01:23:57,591
Jeez.

1346
01:24:01,262 --> 01:24:03,498
My God.

1347
01:24:03,531 --> 01:24:06,068
Leather-skinned bastard
drove me through a wall

1348
01:24:06,102 --> 01:24:09,474
and still couldn't kill
old Sampson.

1349
01:24:09,506 --> 01:24:12,677
And now you kids
are here to rescue me?

1350
01:24:12,711 --> 01:24:16,049
We'll show them reptili-birds
what's what, right?

1351
01:24:18,218 --> 01:24:20,856
Now, who's gonna help me
get out of here?

1352
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:24,559
I don't suppose
anyone thought

1353
01:24:24,593 --> 01:24:27,064
to bring my flask
with them, did they?

1354
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:30,802
No.

1355
01:24:30,834 --> 01:24:32,838
Must've slipped my mind.

1356
01:24:32,870 --> 01:24:36,008
There's got to be something
to drink around this place.

1357
01:24:40,581 --> 01:24:41,984
Hey, what's wrong?

1358
01:24:42,016 --> 01:24:43,918
The eggs.

1359
01:24:43,952 --> 01:24:46,222
Why are they bringing them here?

1360
01:24:46,254 --> 01:24:48,691
They're building a new nest?
It makes no sense.

1361
01:24:48,724 --> 01:24:49,994
Unless they're all males,

1362
01:24:50,027 --> 01:24:51,897
but then
where are all the females?

1363
01:24:51,930 --> 01:24:53,565
Wait, how do you know
these ain't female?

1364
01:24:53,598 --> 01:24:55,200
I mean, did you look?

1365
01:24:55,234 --> 01:24:56,802
Maybe they're waiting
for something.

1366
01:24:56,834 --> 01:25:00,909
Maybe... maybe
they're like ants or bees.

1367
01:25:00,942 --> 01:25:03,244
How so?

1368
01:25:06,081 --> 01:25:08,619
There's always a queen.

1369
01:25:18,229 --> 01:25:20,568
God damn it.

1370
01:25:37,355 --> 01:25:38,725
Move.

1371
01:25:38,757 --> 01:25:40,626
-Move!
-Yeah.

1372
01:25:51,841 --> 01:25:54,878
Hey, guys, I'd say right now
is a great time to retire

1373
01:25:54,911 --> 01:25:56,314
from the monster-hunting
business?

1374
01:25:56,347 --> 01:25:59,385
No, no, no, we need to end this.

1375
01:25:59,418 --> 01:26:03,090
Jonas, we can't just stay here.

1376
01:26:03,122 --> 01:26:06,094
We need to kill it,
here and now.

1377
01:26:06,127 --> 01:26:07,796
-This may be our only chance.
-Yeah?

1378
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:09,900
And how do you propose
we do that?

1379
01:26:16,774 --> 01:26:18,710
With that?
No, no way.

1380
01:26:18,742 --> 01:26:20,145
That is not enough explosives.

1381
01:26:20,178 --> 01:26:21,780
Come on, man,
look at that thing.

1382
01:26:21,814 --> 01:26:23,683
It's, like, a half a dozen
stories tall.

1383
01:26:23,717 --> 01:26:25,420
Then we need something
that's gonna make a bigger boom.

1384
01:26:25,452 --> 01:26:27,421
Yeah, like what?

1385
01:26:27,455 --> 01:26:30,126
Great news, everyone.

1386
01:26:30,158 --> 01:26:32,328
I found the liquor cabinet!

1387
01:26:34,765 --> 01:26:35,700
What?

1388
01:26:37,333 --> 01:26:39,137
How many more do we got?

1389
01:26:39,170 --> 01:26:40,405
How many more do you need?

1390
01:26:45,412 --> 01:26:47,983
No! Wait!
You don't understand.

1391
01:26:48,016 --> 01:26:49,951
What are we doing?
This better work.

1392
01:26:49,984 --> 01:26:51,154
They can't use that one.

1393
01:26:51,186 --> 01:26:54,290
Listen, it's not fair!
Please!

1394
01:26:54,324 --> 01:26:56,093
All I wanted to do
was have a drink.

1395
01:26:56,125 --> 01:26:57,728
Just a drink.

1396
01:26:57,761 --> 01:26:59,130
Come on!

1397
01:26:59,162 --> 01:27:01,332
Is that
so much to ask?

1398
01:27:01,365 --> 01:27:03,671
-No, no, no!
-Will you hurry up, please?

1399
01:27:12,782 --> 01:27:14,384
-All right.
-Now...

1400
01:27:14,417 --> 01:27:16,821
we just got to get
its attention.

1401
01:27:16,854 --> 01:27:19,725
How are we gonna do that?

1402
01:27:19,758 --> 01:27:21,160
I think I know how.

1403
01:27:44,923 --> 01:27:47,962
Okay, maybe a little
too much attention.

1404
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:57,541
It's coming.
Pull the pins.

1405
01:27:57,573 --> 01:27:59,342
Pull the pins.
Pull the pins. Pull the pins.

1406
01:27:59,376 --> 01:28:00,946
Pull the pins!

1407
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:23,475
Sit tight, kiddo.

1408
01:28:23,507 --> 01:28:26,479
It's my turn to kill
one of these bastards.

1409
01:28:27,981 --> 01:28:29,883
In the name
of my forefathers

1410
01:28:29,915 --> 01:28:32,187
and alcoholics everywhere!

1411
01:28:51,377 --> 01:28:53,381
Have a drink!

1412
01:29:11,672 --> 01:29:13,074
Say it, Lars.
You know you want to.

1413
01:29:13,106 --> 01:29:14,408
Goddamn...

1414
01:29:36,136 --> 01:29:37,640
Good one, Sampson!

1415
01:29:39,942 --> 01:29:41,177
Never thought
I'd actually say this,

1416
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:42,478
but I think
I'm gonna miss him.

1417
01:29:45,482 --> 01:29:47,219
Hey, guys, I think
it's still alive.

1418
01:29:47,251 --> 01:29:48,620
Jeez!

1419
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:55,094
Sampson!

1420
01:29:55,128 --> 01:29:56,331
My God, yes!

1421
01:29:56,363 --> 01:29:57,299
Yes!

1422
01:29:59,635 --> 01:30:01,204
I'm okay.

1423
01:30:02,706 --> 01:30:04,274
Just a little juicy, I guess.

1424
01:30:04,306 --> 01:30:05,409
Shame about the head.

1425
01:30:05,442 --> 01:30:06,977
Would've made a fine trophy.

1426
01:30:08,413 --> 01:30:10,014
It's okay, the bitch probably

1427
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:12,452
wouldn't have fit
on the wall anyway.

1428
01:30:13,719 --> 01:30:16,223
Hey, look!
The cavalry's arrived.

1429
01:30:20,261 --> 01:30:21,397
Screw 'em!

1430
01:30:21,429 --> 01:30:24,701
I got this one fair and square.

1431
01:30:28,672 --> 01:30:30,609
Not so scary now, am I?

1432
01:30:34,481 --> 01:30:38,251
Let's just say I'm allowed to
sweep you off your feet a little.

1433
01:30:38,285 --> 01:30:40,255
Hey, Lars, you gonna be ready
for work on Monday?

1434
01:30:40,287 --> 01:30:42,223
I think I need a break
from the yard care business.

1435
01:30:42,256 --> 01:30:44,126
What do you have in mind?

1436
01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:45,261
I need a vacation.

1437
01:30:47,196 --> 01:30:51,003
Man, one hell of a way
to spend a weekend?

1438
01:30:52,670 --> 01:30:54,473
I need a drink.

1439
01:31:08,392 --> 01:31:11,562
Good evening, and welcome back to
"Tonight with Tommy Killingsworth,"

1440
01:31:11,595 --> 01:31:13,631
the talk show that has
the interviews you want

1441
01:31:13,665 --> 01:31:16,168
with the subjects
that matter most.

1442
01:31:16,202 --> 01:31:19,706
Today we're talking about the
so-called terrordactyl invasion.

1443
01:31:23,111 --> 01:31:24,580
Now, the remaining pterodactyls

1444
01:31:24,613 --> 01:31:27,284
have been rounded up and sent
to an uninhabited island

1445
01:31:27,316 --> 01:31:31,189
in South America where they're being
closely watched by the military.

1446
01:31:31,222 --> 01:31:34,727
The question I have is,
what's gonna happen next?

1447
01:31:34,759 --> 01:31:37,229
Now, all the pterodactyls,
if I'm not mistaken...

1448
01:31:37,263 --> 01:31:38,532
Scumbag.

1449
01:31:44,472 --> 01:31:47,643
Look at you, Rico Suave.
Very nice.

1450
01:31:47,677 --> 01:31:49,213
Well, I figured
I had to step it up

1451
01:31:49,246 --> 01:31:50,481
since you came
with the Elmer Fudd line.

1452
01:31:50,513 --> 01:31:52,116
-Very nice.
-Funny, funny.

1453
01:31:52,149 --> 01:31:53,484
Fashionably late, I see.

1454
01:31:53,518 --> 01:31:55,188
That's what happens to a man

1455
01:31:55,221 --> 01:31:57,057
when he gets caught out front
signing autographs.

1456
01:31:58,325 --> 01:31:59,827
Wait, where's Candice?

1457
01:31:59,860 --> 01:32:01,528
Stuck at her book signing.
Should've seen the line.

1458
01:32:01,562 --> 01:32:03,231
-Shut up.
-Wrapped around the block.

1459
01:32:03,263 --> 01:32:05,100
Check it out.

1460
01:32:05,134 --> 01:32:06,602
How's he doing?

1461
01:32:06,635 --> 01:32:08,839
-Same as always.
-That bad?

1462
01:32:08,872 --> 01:32:11,642
With me tonight
are two pterodactyl experts:

1463
01:32:11,675 --> 01:32:13,878
Sampson McLain,
who has been hailed as one

1464
01:32:13,911 --> 01:32:16,781
of the heroes of Los Angeles
after a cell phone video

1465
01:32:16,815 --> 01:32:19,318
of him helping defend the city
against the beasts

1466
01:32:19,352 --> 01:32:20,888
went viral
in the days after.

1467
01:32:20,921 --> 01:32:23,224
Dude... shit.

1468
01:32:23,256 --> 01:32:25,126
We also have
Teresa Quinn,

1469
01:32:25,159 --> 01:32:28,530
a biologist and astrophysicist
with Columbia University.

1470
01:32:28,564 --> 01:32:31,869
Now, Sampson, I'm interested
in your thoughts

1471
01:32:31,901 --> 01:32:35,339
about this pterodactyl
relocation project.

1472
01:32:35,372 --> 01:32:36,908
Relocation?

1473
01:32:36,942 --> 01:32:38,577
Listen, junior.

1474
01:32:38,609 --> 01:32:40,814
The pterodactyls
have had their day.

1475
01:32:40,846 --> 01:32:42,315
They're history.

1476
01:32:42,348 --> 01:32:44,518
Actually, they're prehistory.

1477
01:32:44,552 --> 01:32:46,421
It's now the day
of the human being,

1478
01:32:46,454 --> 01:32:50,359
and it's our job to make sure
that it stays that way.

1479
01:32:50,393 --> 01:32:52,363
As Americans,
we will never again

1480
01:32:52,395 --> 01:32:54,832
be afraid of things
from the past.

1481
01:32:54,865 --> 01:32:56,600
Listen, kiddo.

1482
01:32:56,633 --> 01:32:59,539
I've seen things that would
really curl your hair.

1483
01:33:00,606 --> 01:33:03,477
So did you ask her yet?

1484
01:33:03,510 --> 01:33:04,779
Come on.

1485
01:33:04,811 --> 01:33:06,648
What? Come on.
Don't be so worried.

1486
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:08,283
It's not that I'm worried.

1487
01:33:08,316 --> 01:33:10,520
It's, like, you know, timing,
all that stuff.

1488
01:33:10,553 --> 01:33:12,489
Well, whatever.
Let me see it.

1489
01:33:12,522 --> 01:33:15,426
-Now?
-Yeah, come on, whip it out.

1490
01:33:15,459 --> 01:33:17,261
All right.
Careful, though, okay?

1491
01:33:17,295 --> 01:33:18,898
-Careful.
-Careful, careful, careful.

1492
01:33:21,534 --> 01:33:23,604
Nice.

1493
01:33:23,637 --> 01:33:25,339
Just one thing, though.

1494
01:33:25,371 --> 01:33:26,508
What? What? What?
What's wrong?

1495
01:33:26,540 --> 01:33:27,909
Did you have
to get one so big?

1496
01:33:27,942 --> 01:33:29,712
I mean, you're not
compensating, are you?

1497
01:33:29,745 --> 01:33:32,348
What, 'cause my balls
ain't as big as my brain?

1498
01:33:32,380 --> 01:33:34,884
No, I'll admit, you got that one
figured out just fine.

1499
01:33:37,622 --> 01:33:40,558
Listen, slick,
I shot sharks in the river.

1500
01:33:40,592 --> 01:33:42,461
I've wrestled grizzly bears.

1501
01:33:42,495 --> 01:33:43,897
And for the pterodactyls,

1502
01:33:43,929 --> 01:33:46,800
I've been
in the belly of the beast.

1503
01:33:49,770 --> 01:33:52,274
Crap.
I think we're up next.

1504
01:33:52,307 --> 01:33:53,842
I think somebody's
coming over here. Shit.

1505
01:33:53,875 --> 01:33:55,345
They're ready
to mic you guys up.

1506
01:33:55,379 --> 01:33:56,479
-All right, thanks, man.
-Thanks, bro.

1507
01:34:02,621 --> 01:34:03,890
We'll be ready.

1508
01:34:03,923 --> 01:34:05,859
You can bet your sweet ass
on that, kiddo.

1509
01:34:07,661 --> 01:34:11,032
Hey, Lars.
You coming?

1510
01:34:11,066 --> 01:34:13,435
Can't keep doing
this goddamn job all by myself.

1511
01:34:13,469 --> 01:34:14,671
God damn it.

1512
01:34:18,342 --> 01:34:20,279
Grizzly bears, you say.

1513
01:34:20,311 --> 01:34:21,646
Well, thank you, Sampson.

1514
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:23,750
That was very insightful.

1515
01:34:25,384 --> 01:34:28,288
Ms. Quinn,
let's turn to you now.

1516
01:34:28,322 --> 01:34:30,292
What are your thoughts?

1517
01:34:30,324 --> 01:34:34,629
Well, since the beginning
of time, mankind has asked

1518
01:34:34,663 --> 01:34:37,034
if anyone else
occupies the stars.

1519
01:34:37,066 --> 01:34:39,403
And now we know.

1520
01:34:39,437 --> 01:34:41,439
Our own past is up there,

1521
01:34:41,472 --> 01:34:43,074
waiting to return.

1522
01:34:43,108 --> 01:34:45,445
Containment is only
the first step toward

1523
01:34:45,477 --> 01:34:49,417
preventing an attack like this
from happening again.

1524
01:34:49,450 --> 01:34:51,420
We can learn much
from the pterodactyls,

1525
01:34:51,452 --> 01:34:53,621
but we also must keep in mind

1526
01:34:53,655 --> 01:34:56,359
this may have been
the first wave of these beasts.

1527
01:34:58,127 --> 01:35:00,931
Who knows what other dangers
lurk in space,

1528
01:35:00,964 --> 01:35:03,302
Waiting to fall
into our backyards?

1529
01:35:05,103 --> 01:35:07,307
Who knows what's next?
