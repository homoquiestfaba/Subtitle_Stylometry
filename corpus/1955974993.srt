2
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:53,041
Come. Come through please.

3
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:49,561
Move! Over there!

4
00:04:49,563 --> 00:04:51,362
Everybody,
this is a hijack situation!

5
00:04:51,364 --> 00:04:52,997
Nobody move!

6
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:54,365
- Nobody move!
- If you all stay in your seats

7
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:56,335
and do not move,
no one will be harmed.

8
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,970
But if anybody tries anything,
I will throw this grenade.

9
00:04:58,972 --> 00:05:00,338
Nobody move!
Everyone stay in your seat!

10
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,840
Don't move! I have a bomb!

11
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:11,115
Sit down!

12
00:05:11,117 --> 00:05:13,485
Sit! Sit!

13
00:05:14,989 --> 00:05:16,924
We've got the cabin
under control.

14
00:05:18,258 --> 00:05:19,592
It's four of us.

15
00:05:19,594 --> 00:05:21,025
We've got weapons and bombs.

16
00:05:21,027 --> 00:05:23,896
If you try anything,
you will die.

17
00:05:23,898 --> 00:05:26,165
Comrade 39,
is the cabin secured?

18
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:27,566
- Cabin secured.
- Stay in your seats,

19
00:05:27,568 --> 00:05:29,300
and nobody try anything.

20
00:05:29,302 --> 00:05:32,136
Everyone in here, get into
the back cabin now. Move!

21
00:05:32,138 --> 00:05:33,475
Take nothing with you.
Move, move!

22
00:05:40,013 --> 00:05:41,179
Who's the captain?

23
00:05:41,181 --> 00:05:44,115
- I am.
- You two, out.

24
00:05:44,117 --> 00:05:46,887
I'm the flight engineer.
I'm-I'm needed here.

25
00:05:47,989 --> 00:05:49,287
You, up.

26
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:51,090
Move! Hurry, hurry!

27
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:52,290
- Come on. Come on!
- Leave your bags. Go!

28
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:53,424
- Faster!
- Come on, go!

29
00:05:53,426 --> 00:05:54,626
And you, too.

30
00:05:54,628 --> 00:05:55,994
Okay, okay, okay.

31
00:05:55,996 --> 00:05:58,232
Faster! Come on!

32
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:24,956
<i>If we don't have good schools,</i>

33
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:27,126
<i>a good health system...
if we don't invest</i>

34
00:06:27,128 --> 00:06:31,396
in our own culture,
what are we fighting for?

35
00:06:31,398 --> 00:06:33,232
We cannot allocate
all the taxpayers' money

36
00:06:33,234 --> 00:06:34,633
to your ministry, Shimon.

37
00:06:34,635 --> 00:06:38,270
The defense budget
is already 31% of the GDP.

38
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:41,206
A raise of ten percent
in four years.

39
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,509
In my personal assessment,

40
00:06:43,511 --> 00:06:46,078
a ten-percent increase
in military spending

41
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,547
is the minimum that we need.

42
00:06:48,549 --> 00:06:52,217
Anything less would be
a dereliction of our duty.

43
00:06:52,219 --> 00:06:54,585
Now, this is not about
a choice, gentlemen.

44
00:06:54,587 --> 00:06:56,054
This is compulsory.

45
00:06:56,056 --> 00:06:59,360
This is about the survival
of Israel.

46
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:04,530
As the Yom Kippur War proved,
our intelligence capabilities

47
00:07:04,532 --> 00:07:06,432
are also lacking.

48
00:07:06,434 --> 00:07:08,533
We don't have the assets
on the ground.

49
00:07:08,535 --> 00:07:10,169
We need more agents.

50
00:07:10,171 --> 00:07:12,170
We need to buy more influence.

51
00:07:12,172 --> 00:07:15,006
The Russians
have massively increased

52
00:07:15,008 --> 00:07:17,643
military aid to Egypt.

53
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,244
Syria is also re-arming.

54
00:07:20,246 --> 00:07:22,513
There are
Russian military personnel

55
00:07:22,515 --> 00:07:25,184
back in the Golan Heights.

56
00:07:25,186 --> 00:07:27,585
It is not just tanks
and airplanes.

57
00:07:27,587 --> 00:07:29,121
Also, capabilities are lacking.

58
00:07:29,123 --> 00:07:31,256
If we are caught
off guard again,

59
00:07:31,258 --> 00:07:34,994
the consequences
will be catastrophic.

60
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,396
In my assessment, Russia...

61
00:07:37,398 --> 00:07:39,131
This is compulsory.

62
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:42,033
This is about the ten percent
that we need.

63
00:07:42,035 --> 00:07:45,403
We cannot allocate money
to health and education

64
00:07:45,405 --> 00:07:48,410
when we are being driven
into the sea by our enemies.

65
00:07:50,244 --> 00:07:52,011
You're required to hand over

66
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,013
all documents that give
evidence of your identity.

67
00:07:55,015 --> 00:07:57,316
Anyone who is caught
holding back any papers

68
00:07:57,318 --> 00:07:58,650
will be punished without mercy.

69
00:07:58,652 --> 00:08:00,285
<i>Come on, everyone, give me</i>

70
00:08:00,287 --> 00:08:01,686
<i>your passport
and I.D. card, too.</i>

71
00:08:01,688 --> 00:08:05,160
Passport. Passport.

72
00:08:11,364 --> 00:08:13,400
Passport. I.D.

73
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,173
Come on, give me
your I.D. card, too.

74
00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:30,651
Okay.

75
00:08:34,754 --> 00:08:36,725
Passport.

76
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:54,205
There are 239 passengers
on board.

77
00:08:54,207 --> 00:08:55,707
83 are Israeli.

78
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:57,708
Legally, it's a French problem.

79
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,212
It's their airliner
and mostly their citizens.

80
00:09:00,214 --> 00:09:02,146
If it's a hijack,
we'll make sure

81
00:09:02,148 --> 00:09:03,348
the press understands that.

82
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,516
I can call the editors.

83
00:09:04,518 --> 00:09:05,818
It's a hijack.

84
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,688
They'll fly back here
to challenge us.

85
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,756
They always do.

86
00:09:11,758 --> 00:09:15,194
Amos, Prime Minister...

87
00:09:15,196 --> 00:09:17,762
this is our problem.

88
00:09:17,764 --> 00:09:20,200
You mean it's my problem,
Shimon?

89
00:09:36,816 --> 00:09:38,250
- Uh...
- Sit down.

90
00:09:38,252 --> 00:09:40,852
- No, excuse me, but...
- Sit down.

91
00:09:40,854 --> 00:09:43,258
My daughter really needs
to go to the bathroom.

92
00:09:50,498 --> 00:09:52,330
You?

93
00:09:52,332 --> 00:09:53,498
Yeah.

94
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,135
You need to go?

95
00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:57,502
Hurry up.

96
00:09:59,606 --> 00:10:02,709
- I need to go, too.
- You can stay sitting down.

97
00:10:04,177 --> 00:10:05,746
Miss...

98
00:10:07,248 --> 00:10:09,751
Your blouse is open.

99
00:10:20,594 --> 00:10:22,461
Don't try and break
the undercarriage.

100
00:10:22,463 --> 00:10:24,362
If you do, we'll die together.

101
00:10:24,364 --> 00:10:27,201
Don't worry.
I'll do a kiss landing.

102
00:10:35,408 --> 00:10:37,311
Reverse.

103
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,182
Check.

104
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:45,787
Good, Captain.

105
00:11:00,334 --> 00:11:01,967
Why is this taking so long?

106
00:11:01,969 --> 00:11:03,702
Unless you tell me
where we're going,

107
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,938
I'm going to need
five or six of these.

108
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,805
Okay.

109
00:11:07,807 --> 00:11:09,974
Get back inside the plane.

110
00:11:09,976 --> 00:11:12,743
If you want to fly on
and if you want to be safe,

111
00:11:12,745 --> 00:11:15,479
I-I need to do
my pre-flight checks.

112
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:18,585
I need to check the wheels,
the brakes and the engine.

113
00:11:20,321 --> 00:11:23,387
You should be taking care
of those people inside.

114
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:25,424
They've been on this plane
five hours now.

115
00:11:25,426 --> 00:11:27,162
They need food and drinks.

116
00:11:30,397 --> 00:11:32,367
You will run.

117
00:11:33,566 --> 00:11:36,400
You have my word, I won't.

118
00:11:36,402 --> 00:11:38,270
And you don't want
to be holding that

119
00:11:38,272 --> 00:11:40,441
next to a fuel truck.

120
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,709
Are you a member
of Baader-Meinhof?

121
00:11:44,711 --> 00:11:46,344
Fill up the plane, engineer.

122
00:11:46,346 --> 00:11:47,848
Do your job.

123
00:12:21,447 --> 00:12:22,647
Jaber.

124
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:25,049
- Brigitte, Juan Pablo.
- Hello.

125
00:12:25,051 --> 00:12:27,019
Hijacking a plane?

126
00:12:27,021 --> 00:12:29,688
That is a serious step.

127
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,490
What's in it for us?

128
00:12:31,492 --> 00:12:33,391
Let's just see
what Jaber has to say.

129
00:12:33,393 --> 00:12:34,394
Sit.

130
00:12:43,836 --> 00:12:45,937
Your movement
is under pressure.

131
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:49,407
Your support is fading.

132
00:12:49,409 --> 00:12:51,575
Many of your colleagues
are in jail.

133
00:12:51,577 --> 00:12:56,080
An action like this can inspire
a new generation to follow you.

134
00:12:56,082 --> 00:12:57,915
The PFLP will call
for the release

135
00:12:57,917 --> 00:12:59,851
of 50 Palestinian prisoners.

136
00:12:59,853 --> 00:13:02,087
We could also demand the
release of some of our friends.

137
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:04,790
If we do this,
we can demand anything we want.

138
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:07,726
We can demand that
Ulrike Meinhof is on the list?

139
00:13:07,728 --> 00:13:09,727
They will never release Ulrike.

140
00:13:09,729 --> 00:13:11,663
Like I said,

141
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,732
if we do this right,

142
00:13:13,734 --> 00:13:16,336
they have to do
whatever we want.

143
00:13:38,024 --> 00:13:39,790
Aim!

144
00:13:39,792 --> 00:13:41,028
Fire!

145
00:13:43,062 --> 00:13:44,631
Bose!

146
00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:48,402
We need to talk.

147
00:14:00,748 --> 00:14:02,546
Ulrike Meinhof is dead.

148
00:14:02,548 --> 00:14:04,418
She killed herself.

149
00:14:05,518 --> 00:14:07,586
Your movement is dying.

150
00:14:07,588 --> 00:14:09,023
She cut her hair.

151
00:14:10,957 --> 00:14:13,424
No, she quit.

152
00:14:13,426 --> 00:14:15,662
And that poses a problem.

153
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,600
Which problem?

154
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:22,800
His father and his mother.

155
00:14:22,802 --> 00:14:25,404
His sister and his wife,
and their children.

156
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,405
They were all in a camp
in Lebanon.

157
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:30,007
The Israelis raided it.

158
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:33,578
Killed people,
dynamited the houses.

159
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,179
They tried to escape.

160
00:14:35,181 --> 00:14:38,183
They were in a car.
An Israeli tank drove over it.

161
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:40,785
All of them died.

162
00:14:40,787 --> 00:14:42,753
That's how I know
that he's committed.

163
00:14:42,755 --> 00:14:44,189
How do I know
that you're committed

164
00:14:44,191 --> 00:14:45,692
now your comrades are dead?

165
00:14:49,128 --> 00:14:51,862
She would never hang herself.

166
00:14:51,864 --> 00:14:54,665
She was murdered by the state.

167
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:57,501
And if we return to Germany,
we will be murdered, too.

168
00:14:57,503 --> 00:14:59,871
It's all the more important
that we continue.

169
00:14:59,873 --> 00:15:01,975
- For Ulrike.
- And for your family.

170
00:15:06,647 --> 00:15:09,613
At the airport,
Jaber will be in command.

171
00:15:09,615 --> 00:15:13,184
I will stay in Kampala
and liaise with President Amin.

172
00:15:13,186 --> 00:15:15,187
Ugandans will control
the perimeter

173
00:15:15,189 --> 00:15:16,588
of the airfield
and the building.

174
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,155
You will all stay inside.

175
00:15:18,157 --> 00:15:20,825
You must be careful
in these situations.

176
00:15:20,827 --> 00:15:23,761
You must keep your distance
from the passengers.

177
00:15:23,763 --> 00:15:26,164
Emotional attachment
can be really dangerous.

178
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,902
Particularly for women.

179
00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:31,072
I am a revolutionary.

180
00:15:43,883 --> 00:15:45,853
Would you like some water?

181
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:52,093
- Would you like some water?
- Would you like some water?

182
00:15:54,127 --> 00:15:56,531
Would you like some water
for the kids?

183
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:01,198
Would you like some water?

184
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,267
I don't feel well.

185
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:04,870
What do you need?

186
00:16:04,872 --> 00:16:06,604
I-I'm pregnant.

187
00:16:06,606 --> 00:16:08,540
I think I'm having
a miscarriage.

188
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:11,045
- Okay, I'm going to try to find you a doctor, okay?
- Yeah.

189
00:16:12,178 --> 00:16:13,911
Miss? She doesn't feel well.

190
00:16:13,913 --> 00:16:15,914
She really needs
to see a doctor.

191
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,181
What is the problem?

192
00:16:17,183 --> 00:16:18,785
She thinks
she's losing her baby.

193
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,727
Uh, miss, I'm a nurse.

194
00:16:28,729 --> 00:16:31,032
- Maybe I can help.
- You can wait.

195
00:16:36,903 --> 00:16:38,602
Which month?

196
00:16:38,604 --> 00:16:40,541
Two... two months.

197
00:16:42,175 --> 00:16:43,875
Where you from?

198
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,479
England.

199
00:16:51,084 --> 00:16:53,751
We will call an ambulance.

200
00:16:53,753 --> 00:16:56,621
We don't want to hurt anyone.

201
00:16:56,623 --> 00:16:58,290
We're humanitarians.

202
00:16:58,292 --> 00:17:00,527
Come with me.

203
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,707
She's fooling you.

204
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:19,212
It's better to show mercy,
comrade.

205
00:17:22,983 --> 00:17:25,250
I'm losing my baby.

206
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,626
Good luck.

207
00:17:52,346 --> 00:17:53,811
- No radio.
- We have to speak

208
00:17:53,813 --> 00:17:56,013
to air traffic control
for clearance.

209
00:17:56,015 --> 00:17:57,382
The runway's empty.
They know we're leaving.

210
00:17:57,384 --> 00:17:59,017
- Just take off.
- We need to know we're...

211
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:00,018
Take off!

212
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,722
Set thrust.

213
00:18:02,822 --> 00:18:03,990
Set.

214
00:18:15,968 --> 00:18:19,203
The Libyans refueled them
and let them take off again.

215
00:18:19,205 --> 00:18:22,906
Gaddafi doesn't want this
to be his problem, either.

216
00:18:22,908 --> 00:18:24,776
How much fuel?

217
00:18:24,778 --> 00:18:26,681
At least five hours.

218
00:18:28,247 --> 00:18:30,115
Tel Aviv is in range.

219
00:18:30,117 --> 00:18:31,982
They'll land at Ben Gurion.

220
00:18:31,984 --> 00:18:33,788
They want the world to watch.

221
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:37,422
There is one other thing.

222
00:18:37,424 --> 00:18:39,859
They released a passenger.

223
00:18:42,262 --> 00:18:44,361
<i>Uh, there were two Arabs.</i>

224
00:18:44,363 --> 00:18:45,896
Palestinians, I think.

225
00:18:45,898 --> 00:18:47,298
And two Germans.

226
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,768
A man and a woman.

227
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,270
Why did they let you
off the plane?

228
00:18:52,272 --> 00:18:53,805
I lied.

229
00:18:53,807 --> 00:18:55,807
I told them I was pregnant.

230
00:18:55,809 --> 00:18:58,212
Did they say
where they are going?

231
00:19:32,178 --> 00:19:34,878
<i>This whole
operation is nonsense.</i>

232
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,949
We never talked
about going to Uganda.

233
00:19:37,951 --> 00:19:40,417
Idi Amin... he's crazy.

234
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:41,953
He eats people.

235
00:19:41,955 --> 00:19:44,088
He feeds them
to the crocodiles.

236
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,024
We're putting our lives
in the hands of a lunatic.

237
00:19:47,026 --> 00:19:49,394
Once we get to Uganda,
we are safe.

238
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,328
The Israelis have no choice.

239
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,197
They have to negotiate.

240
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:54,901
It's checkmate.

241
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:59,106
And what happens
if they don't negotiate?

242
00:20:00,474 --> 00:20:02,309
They...

243
00:20:04,945 --> 00:20:06,379
They...

244
00:20:07,481 --> 00:20:09,350
They have to.

245
00:20:10,516 --> 00:20:13,253
Or we kill the hostages.

246
00:20:14,387 --> 00:20:16,087
Yes.

247
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:19,057
You will have to kill people.

248
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:22,930
Germans killing Jews...
have you thought about that?

249
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,467
Ulrike Meinhof is dead
because of me.

250
00:20:30,469 --> 00:20:32,503
- That is not true.
- It's true.

251
00:20:32,505 --> 00:20:34,772
I trusted someone
I shouldn't have,

252
00:20:34,774 --> 00:20:37,744
and she was arrested,
and now she is dead.

253
00:20:42,148 --> 00:20:44,982
If you're having doubts...

254
00:20:44,984 --> 00:20:46,920
you should leave.

255
00:20:59,398 --> 00:21:01,768
Do you want me to leave?

256
00:21:58,058 --> 00:22:00,357
<i>Welcome to Entebbe, Uganda.</i>

257
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:02,260
<i>I haven't had the time
up until now</i>

258
00:22:02,262 --> 00:22:03,595
<i>to explain the reasons</i>

259
00:22:03,597 --> 00:22:06,164
<i>for hijacking
an Air France plane.</i>

260
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:08,299
Despite the belief of many

261
00:22:08,301 --> 00:22:10,335
that France
has a pro-Arab policy,

262
00:22:10,337 --> 00:22:12,502
it is one
of the first countries

263
00:22:12,504 --> 00:22:14,975
in the rank
of Palestinian enemies.

264
00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:19,379
France has cooperated
with Mossad.

265
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,447
France has sold planes
to Israel.

266
00:22:23,449 --> 00:22:28,118
France has given Israel help
in building atom bombs.

267
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,392
Palestine has no atom bombs,
no army and no weapons.

268
00:22:34,093 --> 00:22:36,226
The Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine

269
00:22:36,228 --> 00:22:38,195
must utilize other means

270
00:22:38,197 --> 00:22:40,063
<i>to focus the attention
of the world</i>

271
00:22:40,065 --> 00:22:42,001
<i>on the Palestinian people's
struggle.</i>

272
00:22:43,503 --> 00:22:46,303
We call upon revolutionary
movements everywhere

273
00:22:46,305 --> 00:22:48,338
to unite against Israel,

274
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,643
a fascist, Zionist
and racist state.

275
00:22:51,645 --> 00:22:53,511
Israel has exploited

276
00:22:53,513 --> 00:22:55,646
the humanistic sentiments
of its people

277
00:22:55,648 --> 00:22:58,649
to inhuman ends.

278
00:22:58,651 --> 00:23:01,319
She's the heir of Nazism.

279
00:23:01,321 --> 00:23:04,121
I would ask
that you remain calm.

280
00:23:04,123 --> 00:23:06,390
We will not do you any harm.

281
00:23:06,392 --> 00:23:08,393
And we will not kill you.

282
00:23:08,395 --> 00:23:10,127
<i>We are not assassins.</i>

283
00:23:10,129 --> 00:23:14,264
<i>And we do not want to
commit a pointless massacre.</i>

284
00:23:14,266 --> 00:23:16,434
You will spend tonight
on the plane.

285
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:19,173
Tomorrow,
we move to the terminal.

286
00:23:21,006 --> 00:23:23,441
We know you have
a choice of airlines.

287
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,643
Thank you for flying
Air France.

288
00:23:25,645 --> 00:23:28,078
We hope to see you again
very soon.

289
00:23:34,321 --> 00:23:36,020
Now you know how the mind

290
00:23:36,022 --> 00:23:38,522
of a crazy
German revolutionary works.

291
00:23:38,524 --> 00:23:39,926
Captain.

292
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,963
Open the door.

293
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:48,366
- Get back.
- Mind the step.

294
00:23:48,368 --> 00:23:51,435
This is the biggest plane
this airport has ever seen.

295
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,240
Boni, you should see the faces

296
00:23:56,242 --> 00:23:58,509
of the passengers
after your speech.

297
00:23:58,511 --> 00:23:59,711
What?

298
00:23:59,713 --> 00:24:02,347
They are terrified.

299
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:04,549
- What did he say?
- You don't want to know.

300
00:24:06,586 --> 00:24:08,188
- Hey.
- Hey.

301
00:24:52,665 --> 00:24:55,700
Welcome to Uganda.

302
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:59,771
I am His Excellency al-Hajji

303
00:24:59,773 --> 00:25:03,040
Field Marshal Doctor
Idi Amin Dada,

304
00:25:03,042 --> 00:25:05,809
holder of
the British Victoria Cross,

305
00:25:05,811 --> 00:25:08,546
DSO, CMV, MC,

306
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:13,050
appointed by God Almighty
as your savior!

307
00:25:13,052 --> 00:25:15,386
Thank you very much.

308
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:17,454
Thank you very much.

309
00:25:17,456 --> 00:25:19,790
I am the hero of Africa.

310
00:25:19,792 --> 00:25:22,726
And I am your hero.

311
00:25:22,728 --> 00:25:25,762
We will take care
of your every need.

312
00:25:25,764 --> 00:25:28,299
And we hope very much
that you will enjoy

313
00:25:28,301 --> 00:25:31,069
your stay
in our beautiful country.

314
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:34,204
And everything
will be taken care of.

315
00:25:34,206 --> 00:25:36,409
You are in good hands.

316
00:25:38,711 --> 00:25:41,111
Please, please, step inside.

317
00:25:42,448 --> 00:25:44,281
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

318
00:25:44,283 --> 00:25:45,718
Come on.

319
00:26:23,388 --> 00:26:25,125
Yeah.

320
00:26:32,898 --> 00:26:34,331
We did it.

321
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:35,700
Well done. Well done.

322
00:26:35,702 --> 00:26:37,335
When do we start to negotiate?

323
00:26:37,337 --> 00:26:38,368
Relax, comrade.

324
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,503
You've done a good job.

325
00:26:39,505 --> 00:26:40,671
It's up to us now.

326
00:26:40,673 --> 00:26:42,673
And we know the Israelis
very well.

327
00:26:42,675 --> 00:26:44,242
We know how they think,

328
00:26:44,244 --> 00:26:45,876
how they operate,
how they work.

329
00:26:45,878 --> 00:26:48,412
We will handle
the negotiations.

330
00:26:48,414 --> 00:26:51,249
If you have any problems,
just talk to Jaber. Jaber.

331
00:26:51,251 --> 00:26:54,284
Your job is to watch
the passengers.

332
00:26:54,286 --> 00:26:55,721
Both of you.

333
00:27:16,408 --> 00:27:18,876
4,000 kilometers.

334
00:27:18,878 --> 00:27:21,846
No hijacker has ever
taken a plane this far away

335
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,482
from the operational sphere
of our armed forces.

336
00:27:24,484 --> 00:27:25,916
It must be Haddad.

337
00:27:25,918 --> 00:27:28,286
Prime Minister,
you can't give in,

338
00:27:28,288 --> 00:27:29,720
or every Israeli they target

339
00:27:29,722 --> 00:27:31,458
will be taken
to another country.

340
00:27:34,293 --> 00:27:36,694
Defense Minister,
your job is to come up

341
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,396
with military options
for going to Africa.

342
00:27:39,398 --> 00:27:42,532
Once you have a viable one,
I'll decide what to do.

343
00:27:42,534 --> 00:27:45,203
Any questions?

344
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,803
Amos will coordinate
an emergency committee.

345
00:27:46,805 --> 00:27:49,775
As soon as we get the demands,
we will meet again.

346
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,748
<i>You know,
this is not Peres' problem.</i>

347
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,651
It's your face on the front
of every newspaper.

348
00:28:00,653 --> 00:28:02,720
If it's Haddad,
he's going to demand

349
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:05,556
the release of every terrorist
in our jails.

350
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:07,692
Well, you can't release them.

351
00:28:07,694 --> 00:28:09,626
That's political suicide.

352
00:28:09,628 --> 00:28:10,830
I know that.

353
00:29:23,069 --> 00:29:25,004
How is this going to work?

354
00:29:29,775 --> 00:29:32,076
How is this going to work?

355
00:29:32,078 --> 00:29:34,444
This place is filthy.
We got children here.

356
00:29:34,446 --> 00:29:35,745
I'll have it cleaned.

357
00:29:35,747 --> 00:29:37,080
And they'll bring mattresses.

358
00:29:37,082 --> 00:29:38,782
It's all going to be fine.

359
00:29:38,784 --> 00:29:40,586
Don't worry.

360
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:46,624
Why should I believe
a crazy German revolutionary?

361
00:29:46,626 --> 00:29:48,762
Everything will become clear.

362
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,798
Everything.

363
00:30:38,778 --> 00:30:40,714
Turn it back on.

364
00:30:44,149 --> 00:30:46,585
Do you still sleep
with your lights on?

365
00:30:50,656 --> 00:30:52,591
Go to bed.

366
00:31:04,035 --> 00:31:05,504
<i>Ja.</i>

367
00:31:16,616 --> 00:31:18,616
<i>Israel is a fascist state,</i>

368
00:31:18,618 --> 00:31:22,153
and true anti-fascism means
clear and simple solidarity

369
00:31:22,155 --> 00:31:23,753
with the Palestinians.

370
00:31:23,755 --> 00:31:25,755
Stop quoting these slogans.

371
00:31:25,757 --> 00:31:28,959
Germans hijacking
a planeload of Israelis.

372
00:31:28,961 --> 00:31:30,994
Jews. How do you think
the world's going to react?

373
00:31:30,996 --> 00:31:33,731
You know, the only thing that
we have to face is the fact

374
00:31:33,733 --> 00:31:35,165
that German people
cannot analyze

375
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:36,700
the conflict in the Near East

376
00:31:36,702 --> 00:31:38,872
because we are all
paralyzed by guilt.

377
00:31:40,673 --> 00:31:42,940
West Germany is
a fascist society, Juan Pablo.

378
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,875
Perhaps it doesn't
appear so to you,

379
00:31:44,877 --> 00:31:47,110
but those who are in charge
are the same ones

380
00:31:47,112 --> 00:31:48,611
who were in charge
under Nazism.

381
00:31:48,613 --> 00:31:50,614
And their guilt
has provided the funds

382
00:31:50,616 --> 00:31:52,148
which have allowed Israel
to develop

383
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:54,851
into an imperialist
military base.

384
00:31:54,853 --> 00:31:57,555
We can't just read these books.

385
00:31:57,557 --> 00:31:59,557
We need to become them.

386
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:01,658
Annihilation
is for adolescents.

387
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,159
There's a right of revolution

388
00:32:03,161 --> 00:32:05,463
against political oppression
and social injustice.

389
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,464
You are not oppressed.
You have a business.

390
00:32:07,466 --> 00:32:09,133
There's a right of revolution
against capitalism.

391
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,134
You are a capitalist.

392
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,801
A bourgeois. We all are.

393
00:32:11,803 --> 00:32:13,703
If that is what you think,
then we have to act,

394
00:32:13,705 --> 00:32:15,239
and we have to act now.

395
00:32:15,241 --> 00:32:18,509
I do not know what you
are scared of, Juan Pablo.

396
00:32:18,511 --> 00:32:20,043
I'm not scared of anything.

397
00:32:20,045 --> 00:32:21,782
But maybe you should be.

398
00:32:23,014 --> 00:32:25,685
I only fear a life
without meaning.

399
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,214
Can I help you, madam?

400
00:32:58,216 --> 00:33:00,584
I'm sorry,
I don't speak German.

401
00:33:00,586 --> 00:33:03,253
Just try... try to breathe.

402
00:33:03,255 --> 00:33:05,090
Now, listen.

403
00:33:13,632 --> 00:33:15,031
No, no.

404
00:33:15,033 --> 00:33:17,036
No, please...
please don't do that.

405
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,306
No, wh-what are you doing?

406
00:33:22,308 --> 00:33:24,008
No.

407
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:27,077
Okay. It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

408
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:30,848
Please. I-I don't understand
what you're saying, but...

409
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,782
Listen. Please calm down.

410
00:33:32,784 --> 00:33:34,952
Just calm down. Calm down.

411
00:33:34,954 --> 00:33:37,157
I don't understand
what she's saying.

412
00:34:11,757 --> 00:34:13,857
Two Germans.

413
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:15,228
Yes.

414
00:34:16,795 --> 00:34:19,262
You said.

415
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,701
They'll be revolutionaries.

416
00:34:27,672 --> 00:34:29,975
Seven hours now, no news.

417
00:34:31,076 --> 00:34:33,143
This time, it's different.

418
00:34:33,145 --> 00:34:36,045
They are doing
what they are doing, Yitzhak.

419
00:34:36,047 --> 00:34:38,784
There is nothing
you can do about it.

420
00:34:42,355 --> 00:34:44,623
Get some sleep.

421
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,880
<i>Any rescue force</i>

422
00:35:43,882 --> 00:35:45,882
<i>would have to approach
the old terminal unnoticed.</i>

423
00:35:45,884 --> 00:35:48,886
Look, we can put the men
on a Hercules

424
00:35:48,888 --> 00:35:51,255
and land at the airport
at night.

425
00:35:51,257 --> 00:35:53,891
- Without runway lights?
- Yeah.

426
00:35:53,893 --> 00:35:55,826
That's great.

427
00:35:55,828 --> 00:35:57,828
I don't think Rabin
will go for that.

428
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:01,065
What if we drop a small
parachute force instead?

429
00:36:01,067 --> 00:36:02,766
Uh, parachute force

430
00:36:02,768 --> 00:36:04,867
would be dispersed
over too large an area.

431
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:07,904
So we could use Lake Victoria.

432
00:36:07,906 --> 00:36:11,974
Either parachute in
with inflatable boats at night,

433
00:36:11,976 --> 00:36:13,944
or cross from Kenya.

434
00:36:13,946 --> 00:36:17,346
Ehud, there are crocodiles
in Lake Victoria.

435
00:36:17,348 --> 00:36:20,451
Plus, it's impossible to come
all the way across the lake

436
00:36:20,453 --> 00:36:22,719
from Kenya
in rubber boats unnoticed.

437
00:36:22,721 --> 00:36:25,322
This is not a drill, okay?

438
00:36:25,324 --> 00:36:26,956
It's the real world.

439
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:30,860
Motta, why don't we send in
the commandos,

440
00:36:30,862 --> 00:36:33,966
take the airport, and then wait
to hear from Amin?

441
00:36:35,801 --> 00:36:38,168
Well...

442
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,871
if you want to take control
of the airport,

443
00:36:40,873 --> 00:36:43,005
you're gonna have to use
a much bigger force.

444
00:36:43,007 --> 00:36:45,041
Could you run some numbers
for me?

445
00:36:45,043 --> 00:36:48,177
I want to present
a plan tomorrow.

446
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:51,047
Also, call special forces
unit to base.

447
00:36:51,049 --> 00:36:53,050
Of course, Defense Minister.

448
00:36:53,052 --> 00:36:54,183
Thank you.

449
00:36:54,185 --> 00:36:55,688
No problem.

450
00:37:02,895 --> 00:37:06,195
I think I know why Rabin
wanted Motta here.

451
00:37:06,197 --> 00:37:08,766
He wants to stop us
from coming up

452
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,969
with a viable military option.

453
00:37:11,971 --> 00:37:16,273
That way, he doesn't have
to make a decision.

454
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:19,412
He wants to blame you
for this crisis.

455
00:37:21,212 --> 00:37:23,148
That's politics.

456
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,761
You know,
I wish I could do that.

457
00:37:37,061 --> 00:37:39,529
There was a phone call.

458
00:37:39,531 --> 00:37:42,134
They want you back
at base tomorrow.

459
00:37:43,902 --> 00:37:45,871
When is the premiere?

460
00:37:47,005 --> 00:37:48,337
It's not about that.

461
00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:51,407
You know I have
no choice here, right?

462
00:37:51,409 --> 00:37:54,043
Sarah, I have to go.
It's my job.

463
00:37:54,045 --> 00:37:55,813
There's always a choice.

464
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:56,850
That's not true.

465
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,384
What choice
do those hostages have?

466
00:38:00,386 --> 00:38:02,386
If you think
you have no choice,

467
00:38:02,388 --> 00:38:04,190
you're a hostage, too.

468
00:39:15,661 --> 00:39:16,996
Sarah.

469
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:30,139
Dancing, it's like life.

470
00:39:30,141 --> 00:39:32,541
You get hurt, you retract.
That's okay.

471
00:39:32,543 --> 00:39:36,145
But if you become so afraid
that you're always guarded

472
00:39:36,147 --> 00:39:38,547
and never take a leap of faith,

473
00:39:38,549 --> 00:39:41,985
you won't be able to dance.

474
00:39:41,987 --> 00:39:43,523
Again.

475
00:39:46,157 --> 00:39:47,527
From the beginning.

476
00:40:21,025 --> 00:40:22,291
<i>Ja.</i>

477
00:40:22,293 --> 00:40:24,094
Listen.

478
00:40:24,096 --> 00:40:26,295
All of you over here, stand up.

479
00:40:26,297 --> 00:40:27,697
Everyone, close your books,
put your cards down.

480
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:29,366
- It's time to move now.
- And come over here.

481
00:40:29,368 --> 00:40:31,168
- Come on, hurry up.
- You have to... we need you

482
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,302
to take all your belongings,
move over there.

483
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:33,704
- Move the chairs, everything.
- It's all good.

484
00:40:33,706 --> 00:40:34,838
- It's all good.
- Move, move, move.

485
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,239
- Thank you.
- Move off in an orderly way. And the jacket?

486
00:40:37,241 --> 00:40:39,543
Whose jacket is that?
Please move everything.

487
00:40:39,545 --> 00:40:42,279
- Leave nothing behind.
- Listen, we're doing this

488
00:40:42,281 --> 00:40:44,213
to create more space.
It's all good.

489
00:40:44,215 --> 00:40:45,384
It's too crowded in here.

490
00:40:48,186 --> 00:40:49,589
Okay?

491
00:41:51,315 --> 00:41:54,150
When you hear your name,
you stand up,

492
00:41:54,152 --> 00:41:58,190
come collect your passport
and go to the other room.

493
00:42:00,826 --> 00:42:02,528
Almog, Ezra.

494
00:42:05,831 --> 00:42:08,297
Cohen, Pasco.

495
00:42:08,299 --> 00:42:09,833
Come on, come on.

496
00:42:09,835 --> 00:42:11,835
Fast, fast, fast. Come here.

497
00:42:11,837 --> 00:42:13,837
Steinberg, Mark.

498
00:42:17,775 --> 00:42:18,775
Abrams, Isaac.

499
00:42:21,145 --> 00:42:22,679
Rubens, Michael.

500
00:42:22,681 --> 00:42:24,780
Your Front for the Liberation
of Palestine passport.

501
00:42:24,782 --> 00:42:26,382
- June, Ladis.
- Go through the hole.

502
00:42:26,384 --> 00:42:29,221
Open your bag. Open your bag.

503
00:42:30,355 --> 00:42:32,188
Bergman, Aaron.

504
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,359
Hurry up. Hurry up.

505
00:42:36,261 --> 00:42:37,360
What is this?

506
00:42:37,362 --> 00:42:38,360
Everybody.

507
00:42:38,362 --> 00:42:39,728
Come on, come on, come on.

508
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:42,134
Bloch, Dora.

509
00:42:44,502 --> 00:42:47,270
Cohen, Hanna.

510
00:42:47,272 --> 00:42:49,206
No. Uh, excuse me.
No, no, I-I have children.

511
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:50,607
I can't leave my children.

512
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,442
- Hurry up. Hurry up!
- I must protest at this.

513
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,277
No, you can't be doing this.
This is wrong.

514
00:42:54,279 --> 00:42:56,413
- She can't leave her children.
- It's impossible. - Hey, hey!

515
00:42:56,415 --> 00:42:58,248
Shut up! Sit!

516
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,349
Move! Down!

517
00:42:59,351 --> 00:43:01,521
Down! Down! Shut up!

518
00:43:02,821 --> 00:43:04,820
We didn't agree to this.

519
00:43:04,822 --> 00:43:06,690
- Watch the passengers.
- I'm not a Nazi.

520
00:43:06,692 --> 00:43:08,291
- Watch the passengers!
- Hey! Sit down! Hey!

521
00:43:08,293 --> 00:43:09,692
I want to talk to Haddad.

522
00:43:09,694 --> 00:43:12,329
- Later.
- We talk about this now.

523
00:43:12,331 --> 00:43:14,197
- We talk about this now!
- Watch the passengers.

524
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:15,799
We'll talk about this later.

525
00:43:18,703 --> 00:43:20,536
Now, shut the fuck up,
all of you!

526
00:43:20,538 --> 00:43:23,672
Anyone who tries to resist me
will be shot.

527
00:43:23,674 --> 00:43:25,243
Do you understand?

528
00:43:28,313 --> 00:43:30,346
All of you. Now.

529
00:43:30,348 --> 00:43:32,616
Hartuv, Ilan.

530
00:43:32,618 --> 00:43:34,119
Next.

531
00:43:37,422 --> 00:43:40,226
Mayet, Sala.

532
00:43:41,692 --> 00:43:44,162
Mayet, Abraham.

533
00:43:45,264 --> 00:43:47,834
Elbaz, Maurice.

534
00:43:51,904 --> 00:43:54,404
Ullman, Rebecca.

535
00:43:56,674 --> 00:43:59,476
Israeli?

536
00:43:59,478 --> 00:44:02,244
Why do you have French passport
and Israeli I.D. card?

537
00:44:02,246 --> 00:44:04,280
Well, I-I'm a French citizen.

538
00:44:04,282 --> 00:44:05,648
I was working in Israel,

539
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:07,918
and, uh, I've got
that I.D. card,

540
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,418
which I handed in
with my passport.

541
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,420
You are soldier.

542
00:44:10,422 --> 00:44:11,887
No, I'm French. I, uh...

543
00:44:11,889 --> 00:44:13,790
You are spy.

544
00:44:13,792 --> 00:44:15,724
Wait.
No, I-I'm a French citizen.

545
00:44:15,726 --> 00:44:17,427
All right.

546
00:44:17,429 --> 00:44:18,898
- Move. Move!
- Okay.

547
00:44:20,831 --> 00:44:22,532
He's French.

548
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:24,201
He is your friend?

549
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,339
- Yes.
- Then you go through there, too.

550
00:44:32,944 --> 00:44:34,811
For this plan to succeed,

551
00:44:34,813 --> 00:44:36,746
we need to use
a big enough force

552
00:44:36,748 --> 00:44:38,848
to seize control
of the airport.

553
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:41,951
First, we use the commandos,
kill the terrorists,

554
00:44:41,953 --> 00:44:43,587
secure the hostages.

555
00:44:43,589 --> 00:44:46,355
Then we fly in reinforcements.

556
00:44:46,357 --> 00:44:50,228
Heavy weaponry,
at least 1,000 men.

557
00:44:51,596 --> 00:44:53,630
You want to invade Uganda,
Shimon?

558
00:44:53,632 --> 00:44:57,701
Oh, we give it back to them
when we leave.

559
00:44:57,703 --> 00:44:59,835
We cannot invade a country
that is a member

560
00:44:59,837 --> 00:45:01,971
of the UN
and the African League.

561
00:45:01,973 --> 00:45:05,275
And it's impossible to move
a force of that size

562
00:45:05,277 --> 00:45:06,576
4,000 kilometers undetected.

563
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:08,411
We have to act.

564
00:45:08,413 --> 00:45:11,348
There can be no negotiations
with terrorists.

565
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:13,916
I'm talking to
the chief of staff, Shimon.

566
00:45:13,918 --> 00:45:16,286
The soldier,
not the politician.

567
00:45:16,288 --> 00:45:19,556
I have to agree
with the prime minister.

568
00:45:19,558 --> 00:45:21,757
We need to find out
if Amin is helping them.

569
00:45:21,759 --> 00:45:24,326
You were in Uganda, right?
You dealt with him?

570
00:45:24,328 --> 00:45:26,429
I trained his army, yes.

571
00:45:26,431 --> 00:45:30,300
I'd like to assume he's not
gonna declare war on France.

572
00:45:30,302 --> 00:45:33,302
Having said that,
the man is absolutely crazy.

573
00:45:33,304 --> 00:45:36,672
He might have a dream,
some kind of a vision,

574
00:45:36,674 --> 00:45:39,708
and anything can happen.

575
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:42,380
I can try... call him.

576
00:45:43,848 --> 00:45:45,782
If Amin is on
the terrorists' side,

577
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,784
we may have to negotiate.

578
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:52,554
Prime Minister, they
are asking for 52 terrorists.

579
00:45:52,556 --> 00:45:55,058
Israel cannot capitulate.
It cannot.

580
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:57,027
They're going to start
killing the hostages

581
00:45:57,029 --> 00:45:59,529
the day after tomorrow.

582
00:45:59,531 --> 00:46:00,764
Call Amin.

583
00:46:00,766 --> 00:46:02,468
I want to know
where he stands.

584
00:46:07,605 --> 00:46:09,471
They have moved
the Jews together

585
00:46:09,473 --> 00:46:11,474
at the old terminal at Entebbe.

586
00:46:11,476 --> 00:46:14,878
They have surrounded them
with high explosives.

587
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,882
They have TNT on the plane
and all around the building,

588
00:46:18,884 --> 00:46:20,750
even on their bodies.

589
00:46:20,752 --> 00:46:24,920
They said that they will commit
suicide with the hostages.

590
00:46:24,922 --> 00:46:28,324
Tell your government
there is nothing I can do.

591
00:46:28,326 --> 00:46:30,559
But, Your Excellency,
this is your country.

592
00:46:30,561 --> 00:46:31,960
You have an opportunity

593
00:46:31,962 --> 00:46:34,931
to go down in history
as a great man.

594
00:46:34,933 --> 00:46:36,532
The man who saved these people.

595
00:46:36,534 --> 00:46:38,735
This is a-a great
opportunity, sir,

596
00:46:38,737 --> 00:46:40,337
given to you by God.

597
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,438
All the terrorists want
is for you

598
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,708
to send your prisoners here.

599
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:48,281
Don't listen to those from
the PFLP sitting beside you.

600
00:46:50,681 --> 00:46:52,782
You are offending me,
old friend.

601
00:46:52,784 --> 00:46:54,650
All I'm trying to do

602
00:46:54,652 --> 00:46:57,052
is make sure
the hostages are safe.

603
00:46:57,054 --> 00:46:58,587
I'm sorry, Your Excellency,

604
00:46:58,589 --> 00:47:01,123
but please consider
what I'm saying.

605
00:47:01,125 --> 00:47:04,626
Don't miss this opportunity

606
00:47:04,628 --> 00:47:06,663
to show the people
who say bad things about you

607
00:47:06,665 --> 00:47:07,931
what a great man you are.

608
00:47:07,933 --> 00:47:10,032
Actually, I-I think this will

609
00:47:10,034 --> 00:47:11,803
get you the Nobel Prize
for peace.

610
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:18,009
Uh, Y-Your Highness?

611
00:47:20,145 --> 00:47:21,781
Y-Your Highness?

612
00:47:26,784 --> 00:47:28,684
Why would the PFLP want us

613
00:47:28,686 --> 00:47:30,520
to fly their prisoners
to Uganda?

614
00:47:30,522 --> 00:47:33,757
I think that's Amin,
not the Palestinians.

615
00:47:33,759 --> 00:47:35,991
He wants to be there when
the prisoners are released.

616
00:47:35,993 --> 00:47:38,128
He wants to show the Soviets
and the Arabs

617
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:39,962
that he is with them now.

618
00:47:39,964 --> 00:47:43,866
He wants their approval,
their support, their arms.

619
00:47:43,868 --> 00:47:45,934
The $5 million.

620
00:47:45,936 --> 00:47:47,936
If the Ugandans
are with the terrorists,

621
00:47:47,938 --> 00:47:50,473
this operation
will have to be even bigger.

622
00:47:50,475 --> 00:47:52,675
I spoke to Kissinger.

623
00:47:52,677 --> 00:47:55,478
He said it's better
if everybody dies

624
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,514
than we negotiate.

625
00:47:57,516 --> 00:47:59,681
Yeah, well,
if it's not a French problem,

626
00:47:59,683 --> 00:48:03,186
then it's even less
of an American problem, Shimon.

627
00:48:03,188 --> 00:48:06,556
Let's do
the only thing we can do.

628
00:48:06,558 --> 00:48:08,527
No, wait. Please.

629
00:48:10,661 --> 00:48:12,063
Yitzhak.

630
00:48:13,831 --> 00:48:17,099
Shimon, let me explain
the situation as it stands.

631
00:48:17,101 --> 00:48:18,735
We have no intelligence.

632
00:48:18,737 --> 00:48:20,837
We only know the hostages
are in the terminal.

633
00:48:20,839 --> 00:48:22,137
Nothing else.

634
00:48:22,139 --> 00:48:23,873
What if they moved
them around last night?

635
00:48:23,875 --> 00:48:25,442
What if now
we have people sitting

636
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:27,210
in the middle of them
with guns and grenades?

637
00:48:27,212 --> 00:48:28,878
As soon as they know
we're coming,

638
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,581
they start to kill the men,
the women, the children.

639
00:48:31,583 --> 00:48:34,954
So they are selecting Jews,
and you want to negotiate.

640
00:48:38,089 --> 00:48:40,155
Shimon...

641
00:48:40,157 --> 00:48:42,625
if we don't negotiate,
if we never negotiate,

642
00:48:42,627 --> 00:48:44,626
if we're always at war,

643
00:48:44,628 --> 00:48:46,496
then we will make
our country a prison,

644
00:48:46,498 --> 00:48:49,465
and every one of our citizens
will be a prisoner.

645
00:48:49,467 --> 00:48:51,601
Our enemies are our neighbors.

646
00:48:51,603 --> 00:48:53,570
We can't get away from them.

647
00:48:53,572 --> 00:48:57,443
One day, we have to talk
and to make peace.

648
00:49:00,645 --> 00:49:02,915
Thank you, gentlemen.

649
00:49:09,721 --> 00:49:11,887
How did they know
you were here?

650
00:49:11,889 --> 00:49:13,223
He guessed.

651
00:49:13,225 --> 00:49:15,224
The spirits warned my mother

652
00:49:15,226 --> 00:49:17,226
I should never offend
the Israelis.

653
00:49:17,228 --> 00:49:18,895
We should listen to my mother.

654
00:49:18,897 --> 00:49:20,498
To your mother?

655
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,032
Release some of the hostages.

656
00:49:24,034 --> 00:49:25,802
It will appease the French

657
00:49:25,804 --> 00:49:27,804
and make things easier
at the airport.

658
00:50:42,112 --> 00:50:43,581
<i>Scheisse.</i>

659
00:52:03,293 --> 00:52:04,295
Here.

660
00:52:05,397 --> 00:52:07,195
This is Idi Amin's car.

661
00:52:07,197 --> 00:52:09,766
Now, all the officials
in Uganda

662
00:52:09,768 --> 00:52:11,366
use a black Mercedes limousine.

663
00:52:11,368 --> 00:52:12,768
Right.

664
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:14,904
If we approached
the terminal in one,

665
00:52:14,906 --> 00:52:16,072
the terrorists
would think Amin

666
00:52:16,074 --> 00:52:17,440
is coming to talk
to the hostages.

667
00:52:17,442 --> 00:52:19,976
That gives us
the element of surprise.

668
00:52:19,978 --> 00:52:22,945
Get me a limo there,
we'll get the job done.

669
00:52:22,947 --> 00:52:23,945
Benny?

670
00:52:23,947 --> 00:52:25,915
What do you think?

671
00:52:25,917 --> 00:52:28,985
We can put the Mercedes
in a Hercules

672
00:52:28,987 --> 00:52:30,286
with Sayeret Matkal,

673
00:52:30,288 --> 00:52:32,320
land the plane
at the new terminal.

674
00:52:32,322 --> 00:52:33,855
- Good.
- They drive the Mercedes

675
00:52:33,857 --> 00:52:37,293
to the old terminal,
kill the terrorists,

676
00:52:37,295 --> 00:52:40,862
put the hostages on a plane,
fly back.

677
00:52:40,864 --> 00:52:42,297
- Perfect.
- Now, to do that,

678
00:52:42,299 --> 00:52:43,965
we need to control
the whole area.

679
00:52:43,967 --> 00:52:45,233
Both terminals.

680
00:52:45,235 --> 00:52:47,936
And what do you need?

681
00:52:47,938 --> 00:52:51,040
Three companies of soldiers...

682
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,842
Dan, please.

683
00:52:52,844 --> 00:52:54,876
Two companies of soldiers,

684
00:52:54,878 --> 00:52:56,846
armor and heavy weapons.

685
00:52:56,848 --> 00:52:58,380
- That will be four planes.
- Right. Move fast.

686
00:52:58,382 --> 00:53:00,282
Keep all units on alert.

687
00:53:00,284 --> 00:53:02,184
Rabin is already talking
to the French.

688
00:53:02,186 --> 00:53:04,454
Okay, we have new orders.
Come down.

689
00:53:04,456 --> 00:53:06,291
Let's go.

690
00:53:14,866 --> 00:53:16,933
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

691
00:53:16,935 --> 00:53:18,400
Please.

692
00:53:18,402 --> 00:53:20,869
We wish you a pleasant journey.

693
00:53:20,871 --> 00:53:23,873
Come and enter the bus.
Enter the bus.

694
00:53:25,877 --> 00:53:28,911
And when you arrive
at your destination,

695
00:53:28,913 --> 00:53:30,980
please tell them

696
00:53:30,982 --> 00:53:34,416
that the president of Uganda
guaranteed your safety.

697
00:53:34,418 --> 00:53:36,485
Ah. Mother, I'm your friend.

698
00:53:36,487 --> 00:53:39,087
- Please say a prayer for us.
- I don't want to leave.

699
00:53:39,089 --> 00:53:41,491
I would like to offer my place
to one of the Israeli people

700
00:53:41,493 --> 00:53:42,927
who are being held.

701
00:53:44,161 --> 00:53:46,027
That will not be possible.

702
00:53:46,029 --> 00:53:48,163
I am not going to go.

703
00:53:48,165 --> 00:53:50,132
Please get inside the bus.

704
00:53:50,134 --> 00:53:53,001
No, I'm not going to go.

705
00:53:54,772 --> 00:53:55,971
She's confused.

706
00:53:55,973 --> 00:53:57,974
Please help her
get inside the bus.

707
00:53:57,976 --> 00:54:00,009
- No. I'm going to stay.
- Help her.

708
00:54:00,011 --> 00:54:01,277
- Help her.
- Get in, madam.

709
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:03,378
- No, I-I want to stay.
- Get in. Get in.

710
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:05,248
Please. I-I want to stay.

711
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:06,250
- Please.
- Get in.

712
00:54:43,554 --> 00:54:45,156
Shalom.

713
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:52,895
I am afraid I'm not
the bearer of glad tidings.

714
00:54:52,897 --> 00:54:55,864
I promised I would do
everything in my power

715
00:54:55,866 --> 00:54:58,166
to have you released.

716
00:54:58,168 --> 00:55:01,170
But they haven't heard
from your government yet.

717
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:04,407
The deadline is 24 hours away.

718
00:55:04,409 --> 00:55:06,945
I'm very worried about you.

719
00:55:08,413 --> 00:55:12,882
These men bear no grudge
against you.

720
00:55:12,884 --> 00:55:17,052
Only against your fascist
Israeli government.

721
00:55:17,054 --> 00:55:21,924
But if your government
do not negotiate,

722
00:55:21,926 --> 00:55:25,862
they will kill two children

723
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,933
every 24 hours.

724
00:55:35,005 --> 00:55:37,208
Starting with these two.

725
00:55:44,449 --> 00:55:46,114
How can you do this?

726
00:55:46,116 --> 00:55:48,650
Standing here
with your machine gun.

727
00:55:48,652 --> 00:55:50,822
These are little children.

728
00:55:52,322 --> 00:55:54,023
We have soldiers.

729
00:55:54,025 --> 00:55:56,395
If you have to fight,
you fight our soldiers.

730
00:56:07,438 --> 00:56:09,237
I don't want a coffee.

731
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:11,440
Zeev, you have a phone call.

732
00:56:11,442 --> 00:56:13,509
Just wish I could be there.

733
00:56:13,511 --> 00:56:16,012
You can't make it?

734
00:56:16,014 --> 00:56:17,380
I got the part I wanted.

735
00:56:17,382 --> 00:56:18,915
Hey, that's great.

736
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,916
I'm happy for you.

737
00:56:20,918 --> 00:56:23,152
Will you be safe?

738
00:56:23,154 --> 00:56:25,858
Don't want to talk about that.

739
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:29,527
Have you been thinking of me?

740
00:56:32,496 --> 00:56:34,465
No, I mean, you know, it...

741
00:56:36,701 --> 00:56:40,670
Sarah, people you love,
sometimes...

742
00:56:40,672 --> 00:56:44,206
thinking of them, it, um...

743
00:56:44,208 --> 00:56:46,144
it doesn't help.

744
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,681
Yeah.

745
00:56:51,683 --> 00:56:53,619
I know what you mean.

746
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:10,166
Have you been practicing
on your shooting range?

747
00:57:10,168 --> 00:57:11,169
Yes.

748
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:13,569
Every day.

749
00:57:13,571 --> 00:57:15,704
Good.

750
00:57:15,706 --> 00:57:17,706
Who was that?

751
00:57:17,708 --> 00:57:19,407
It was my girlfriend.

752
00:57:19,409 --> 00:57:21,277
Is she in the military?

753
00:57:21,279 --> 00:57:22,981
No, she's not.

754
00:57:25,183 --> 00:57:27,449
If you want to be with her,

755
00:57:27,451 --> 00:57:29,684
you need to get her
to join the army.

756
00:57:29,686 --> 00:57:31,587
Otherwise, it's better
you leave her alone.

757
00:57:31,589 --> 00:57:33,154
What do you mean?

758
00:57:33,156 --> 00:57:35,224
I mean exactly what I said.

759
00:57:35,226 --> 00:57:37,128
Trust me, I know.

760
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:41,730
<i>The Palestinian hijackers</i>

761
00:57:41,732 --> 00:57:45,534
released 48 of their hostage
airline passengers.

762
00:57:45,536 --> 00:57:48,270
But they stood nervously
holding machine guns

763
00:57:48,272 --> 00:57:52,074
on the remaining 209
and threatened to kill them all

764
00:57:52,076 --> 00:57:54,043
and to blow up
the French airliner

765
00:57:54,045 --> 00:57:56,045
unless their demands are met.

766
00:57:56,047 --> 00:57:59,181
<i>The 48 passengers they let go
left for Paris,</i>

767
00:57:59,183 --> 00:58:01,416
<i>where they arrived
a short time ago.</i>

768
00:58:01,418 --> 00:58:03,719
<i>John Palmer was there
at the airport.</i>

769
00:58:03,721 --> 00:58:06,422
<i>The VIP lounge
here at Orly Airport</i>

770
00:58:06,424 --> 00:58:08,556
<i>has been cordoned off
by police,</i>

771
00:58:08,558 --> 00:58:10,525
<i>and the waiting room inside</i>

772
00:58:10,527 --> 00:58:13,094
<i>crowded with many relatives
and friends</i>

773
00:58:13,096 --> 00:58:16,132
<i>waiting to greet
the newly released hostages.</i>

774
00:58:16,134 --> 00:58:18,800
<i>Many of them, of course,
all of them on this flight,</i>

775
00:58:18,802 --> 00:58:23,174
<i>consider themselves
very lucky indeed to be alive.</i>

776
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:31,248
Excuse me.

777
00:59:10,353 --> 00:59:12,755
You must know how this looks
to the rest of the world.

778
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:13,788
Yeah.

779
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:16,458
I know how this looks.

780
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:18,295
But it's not the reality.

781
00:59:20,464 --> 00:59:24,132
I'm not responsible for
the actions of my compatriots.

782
00:59:24,134 --> 00:59:25,500
You are repeating
their actions.

783
00:59:25,502 --> 00:59:27,869
No, I'm not.
I'm not the oppressor.

784
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:29,804
I believe in the rights
of the Palestinian people.

785
00:59:29,806 --> 00:59:31,773
They have no homeland.

786
00:59:31,775 --> 00:59:34,242
Have you ever seen
a Palestinian refugee camp?

787
00:59:34,244 --> 00:59:36,311
Have you seen
how these people live?

788
00:59:36,313 --> 00:59:38,114
Have you seen their children?

789
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:41,250
So, for them, you are willing

790
00:59:41,252 --> 00:59:43,788
to exterminate
those people down there?

791
00:59:46,324 --> 00:59:48,226
We have to help them.

792
00:59:51,828 --> 00:59:54,697
What do you do?
What's your job?

793
00:59:54,699 --> 00:59:56,501
You're not a soldier.

794
00:59:58,768 --> 01:00:00,768
I'm a publisher.

795
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:03,239
I publish revolutionary texts.

796
01:00:03,241 --> 01:00:05,444
Have you ever published
any books about plumbing?

797
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:09,480
Not yet.

798
01:00:11,248 --> 01:00:13,516
Dignity...

799
01:00:13,518 --> 01:00:15,918
is all people want.

800
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,290
Dignity comes when you're free.

801
01:00:21,759 --> 01:00:25,360
Running water makes you free.

802
01:00:25,362 --> 01:00:27,563
Toilet...

803
01:00:27,565 --> 01:00:29,333
makes you free.

804
01:00:31,835 --> 01:00:35,339
One plumber
is worth ten revolutionaries.

805
01:00:40,844 --> 01:00:43,747
Do you ever think
you're wasting your life?

806
01:00:45,315 --> 01:00:47,315
No.

807
01:00:47,317 --> 01:00:48,819
Do you?

808
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:52,621
I'm an engineer.

809
01:00:52,623 --> 01:00:53,956
I can make things.

810
01:00:53,958 --> 01:00:57,462
One engineer
is worth 50 revolutionaries.

811
01:01:31,996 --> 01:01:33,628
Jaber. What is this?

812
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:35,463
A holiday camp now?

813
01:01:35,465 --> 01:01:37,201
They are children, Halima.

814
01:01:45,342 --> 01:01:46,808
<i>The pressure on</i>

815
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:48,376
<i>the Israeli government
was tremendous,</i>

816
01:01:48,378 --> 01:01:49,911
<i>especially from
within the country.</i>

817
01:01:49,913 --> 01:01:51,846
<i>Relatives of
the Israeli hostages</i>

818
01:01:51,848 --> 01:01:53,549
<i>held an emotional meeting</i>

819
01:01:53,551 --> 01:01:55,550
<i>with government
representatives this morning.</i>

820
01:01:55,552 --> 01:01:58,020
<i>They didn't care that Israel
has a basic policy</i>

821
01:01:58,022 --> 01:02:00,288
<i>of not dealing
with terrorists.</i>

822
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:01,657
<i>Late in the morning,</i>

823
01:02:01,659 --> 01:02:02,958
<i>they stormed
the government compound,</i>

824
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,125
<i>overwhelming military police,</i>

825
01:02:04,127 --> 01:02:06,829
<i>in an effort to get
at Prime Minister Rabin</i>

826
01:02:06,831 --> 01:02:08,563
<i>and tell him what they thought.</i>

827
01:02:11,768 --> 01:02:13,701
We want answers!
We cannot leave them there!

828
01:02:23,581 --> 01:02:25,748
The families
want the hostages released.

829
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:27,516
But as an Israeli politician,

830
01:02:27,518 --> 01:02:30,985
you can't afford
to negotiate with terrorists.

831
01:02:30,987 --> 01:02:32,721
That's right.

832
01:02:32,723 --> 01:02:34,456
That's what I've become.

833
01:02:34,458 --> 01:02:35,724
Prime Minister!

834
01:02:35,726 --> 01:02:38,661
Prime Minister Rabin!

835
01:02:38,663 --> 01:02:39,994
We want to speak with
the prime minister.

836
01:02:39,996 --> 01:02:42,764
- Stop!
- We want to speak with the prime minister.

837
01:02:42,766 --> 01:02:43,998
He owes us an explanation.

838
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
We want to see
the prime minister.

839
01:02:46,002 --> 01:02:47,735
Wait here.

840
01:02:49,739 --> 01:02:52,608
Everybody, calm down.

841
01:02:57,514 --> 01:02:59,683
We need an explanation!

842
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:21,670
Mr. Ambassador,
this is the prime minister.

843
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:24,038
I would like you
to tell the French

844
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:27,875
that we're going to make
an offer to the terrorists.

845
01:03:27,877 --> 01:03:30,045
To everyone's surprise,
the Israelis today

846
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:31,947
reversed their normal policy

847
01:03:31,949 --> 01:03:34,650
and agreed to negotiate
with the hijackers.

848
01:03:34,652 --> 01:03:37,985
The hijackers put off their
deadline to 8:00 a.m. Sunday

849
01:03:37,987 --> 01:03:40,489
after Israel broke
its long-standing policy

850
01:03:40,491 --> 01:03:41,924
and agreed to negotiate.

851
01:03:41,926 --> 01:03:43,592
The difference of opinion
in Israel

852
01:03:43,594 --> 01:03:45,728
is not over whether the
hostages should be released,

853
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:47,962
but over whether releasing
terrorists from jail here

854
01:03:47,964 --> 01:03:49,898
is too high a price
to pay for it.

855
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:53,067
<i>Tonight, a special series
of prayers began</i>

856
01:03:53,069 --> 01:03:55,570
<i>at the Western Wall
and at most synagogues.</i>

857
01:03:55,572 --> 01:03:57,973
<i>Prayers which expressed
the hope that the government</i>

858
01:03:57,975 --> 01:04:00,074
<i>made the right decision
on the negotiations</i>

859
01:04:00,076 --> 01:04:01,944
<i>and that the Israeli
and Jewish hostages</i>

860
01:04:01,946 --> 01:04:04,980
<i>will indeed come out
of Uganda safely.</i>

861
01:04:55,632 --> 01:04:58,733
- What the hell are you doing?
- What?

862
01:04:58,735 --> 01:05:00,469
You left your gun
lying on the wall.

863
01:05:00,471 --> 01:05:02,170
One of the Jews
could have picked it up.

864
01:05:02,172 --> 01:05:04,072
Relax, man.
The Israelis have surrendered.

865
01:05:04,074 --> 01:05:06,074
They have not surrendered.

866
01:05:06,076 --> 01:05:07,775
What if this is a trick?

867
01:05:07,777 --> 01:05:09,545
What if they are buying
more time?

868
01:05:09,547 --> 01:05:11,983
- We have to be ready.
- Okay, okay.

869
01:05:14,585 --> 01:05:16,521
Why are you here?

870
01:05:20,558 --> 01:05:22,157
I want to throw bombs

871
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:24,559
into the consciousness
of the masses.

872
01:05:24,561 --> 01:05:27,762
And what if you have to throw
a real bomb, my friend?

873
01:05:27,764 --> 01:05:29,465
Have you killed?

874
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:31,703
You think you can do it?

875
01:05:33,136 --> 01:05:36,538
You choose to pick up arms
and fight.

876
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:38,840
You choose to come here.

877
01:05:38,842 --> 01:05:41,844
You could have
a nice life in Europe.

878
01:05:41,846 --> 01:05:44,045
I wish I had your life.

879
01:05:44,047 --> 01:05:46,148
I would not pick up a gun.

880
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:48,583
Only people with nothing
understand.

881
01:05:48,585 --> 01:05:50,487
The Jews understand.

882
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:54,223
When your people
massacred them,

883
01:05:54,225 --> 01:05:57,625
the ones who survived
had nothing.

884
01:05:57,627 --> 01:06:00,496
They brought their dead
to Palestine.

885
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:02,634
They brought
their shame and humiliation.

886
01:06:04,534 --> 01:06:08,203
They did what was done to them
to us.

887
01:06:08,205 --> 01:06:11,739
But I didn't do it to them.

888
01:06:11,741 --> 01:06:13,444
You did it to them.

889
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:18,880
You are here because
you hate your country.

890
01:06:18,882 --> 01:06:21,185
I'm here because I love mine.

891
01:06:24,654 --> 01:06:26,523
Are you ready to kill?

892
01:06:27,625 --> 01:06:29,793
Are you ready to die?

893
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:36,098
If this negotiation
is a trick,

894
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:38,036
we start killing immediately.

895
01:06:41,005 --> 01:06:42,907
Immediately.

896
01:07:02,293 --> 01:07:04,559
We can fly down
over the Red Sea

897
01:07:04,561 --> 01:07:06,795
at low level
to avoid enemy radar.

898
01:07:06,797 --> 01:07:09,730
When the last plane
leaves at 23:45,

899
01:07:09,732 --> 01:07:13,302
the runway lights stay on
for 15 minutes.

900
01:07:13,304 --> 01:07:16,871
- That's our window.
- Mm.

901
01:07:16,873 --> 01:07:19,308
The Ugandan soldiers
have nothing at stake.

902
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:21,108
Once they see us
when we get there,

903
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:22,978
- they will start running.
- Just a second there.

904
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:25,713
You said you didn't have
enough fuel, right?

905
01:07:25,715 --> 01:07:27,315
This is crucial.

906
01:07:27,317 --> 01:07:29,851
Yeah, we're gonna have
to refuel on our way back home.

907
01:07:29,853 --> 01:07:32,887
Sir, Kenya will be
the best place to do it.

908
01:07:32,889 --> 01:07:34,155
Motta.

909
01:07:34,157 --> 01:07:36,324
This operation
is not gonna succeed.

910
01:07:36,326 --> 01:07:39,061
This is a charade, okay?
This... it's fantasy.

911
01:07:39,063 --> 01:07:41,065
The Germans separated the Jews.

912
01:07:43,167 --> 01:07:45,866
Selection, Motta.

913
01:07:45,868 --> 01:07:48,136
We can't just sit here,
do nothing.

914
01:07:48,138 --> 01:07:50,338
These are my men.

915
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:53,808
If they die,
it's my responsibility.

916
01:07:53,810 --> 01:07:56,244
No, Motta.
They are Israeli soldiers.

917
01:07:56,246 --> 01:07:58,583
It's the prime minister's
responsibility.

918
01:08:03,152 --> 01:08:06,023
Are you going to back me up
on this, Motta?

919
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:20,572
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

920
01:08:21,804 --> 01:08:23,404
They're negotiating.

921
01:08:23,406 --> 01:08:25,373
You think they're gonna
call you back?

922
01:08:25,375 --> 01:08:27,908
I don't think the operation's
gonna be approved, but...

923
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:29,846
we have to practice.

924
01:08:30,947 --> 01:08:32,948
Why does it have to be you?

925
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:35,183
How many times
are we gonna talk about this?

926
01:08:35,185 --> 01:08:37,653
We can't just be at war
all the time.

927
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:40,421
You're not at war all the time.
You're a dancer.

928
01:08:40,423 --> 01:08:43,194
I fight so you can dance.

929
01:08:45,361 --> 01:08:48,732
What if I stop dancing?

930
01:09:01,844 --> 01:09:03,280
Yeah.

931
01:09:06,249 --> 01:09:07,448
Calm down.

932
01:09:07,450 --> 01:09:08,984
Quiet, quiet.

933
01:09:08,986 --> 01:09:10,719
Listen.

934
01:09:10,721 --> 01:09:14,221
The Israeli government
has agreed to negotiate.

935
01:09:14,223 --> 01:09:18,292
The deadline has been extended
until 11:00 a.m. on Sunday.

936
01:09:19,862 --> 01:09:21,829
As a gesture of goodwill,

937
01:09:21,831 --> 01:09:23,931
we have released
all French nationals.

938
01:09:23,933 --> 01:09:25,867
And then,
once our comrades are freed,

939
01:09:25,869 --> 01:09:27,903
you will all be free.

940
01:09:27,905 --> 01:09:29,904
You can go back
to the big room now.

941
01:09:29,906 --> 01:09:32,409
Come on.

942
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:35,342
Come on.

943
01:09:35,344 --> 01:09:37,345
Israel never negotiates.

944
01:09:37,347 --> 01:09:39,317
- Come on, everyone.
- No.

945
01:10:13,950 --> 01:10:16,885
Where do you think
you are going?

946
01:10:16,887 --> 01:10:19,090
This is a letter for my wife.

947
01:10:26,763 --> 01:10:28,199
Hurry up.

948
01:10:34,905 --> 01:10:36,840
<i>- Oui, monsieur.
- Merci.</i>

949
01:11:19,850 --> 01:11:21,248
Here.

950
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:23,353
I'll take care of it.

951
01:11:43,906 --> 01:11:45,409
Yeah.

952
01:12:04,328 --> 01:12:05,527
What is this?

953
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:07,895
Huh? It's supposed to be black.

954
01:12:07,897 --> 01:12:09,967
- Hey, it's the only color they had.
- Yeah.

955
01:12:16,072 --> 01:12:17,939
You gotta be kidding me, right?

956
01:12:17,941 --> 01:12:20,375
<i>I want the best shooters
of the unit</i>

957
01:12:20,377 --> 01:12:22,377
<i>inside the Mercedes with me.</i>

958
01:12:22,379 --> 01:12:24,278
<i>We're gonna raid the terminal
in five teams.</i>

959
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:26,280
Joshua will lead
the first team.

960
01:12:26,282 --> 01:12:27,616
Muki, second team.

961
01:12:27,618 --> 01:12:29,951
Zeev, third team.

962
01:12:29,953 --> 01:12:32,653
Amos and Erez,
fourth and fifth.

963
01:12:32,655 --> 01:12:35,489
We're gonna land here
in the new terminal runway,

964
01:12:35,491 --> 01:12:37,359
all the way to here.

965
01:12:37,361 --> 01:12:39,927
We're gonna go out in one
Mercedes and two Land Rovers.

966
01:12:39,929 --> 01:12:42,063
We're gonna drive all the way
to the old terminal.

967
01:12:42,065 --> 01:12:43,631
We're gonna park
under the tower,

968
01:12:43,633 --> 01:12:46,100
hidden from sniper fire.

969
01:12:46,102 --> 01:12:47,601
Surprise and speed is the key.

970
01:12:47,603 --> 01:12:51,538
<i>And if the prime minister
approves this mission,</i>

971
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:53,274
<i>we will go.</i>

972
01:12:53,276 --> 01:12:54,676
<i>The terrorists only need</i>

973
01:12:54,678 --> 01:12:56,310
<i>a few minutes to kill everyone.</i>

974
01:12:56,312 --> 01:12:58,613
What if the first plane
is identified and attacked

975
01:12:58,615 --> 01:13:02,050
before the rest of the force
has time to land and deploy?

976
01:13:02,052 --> 01:13:04,452
They won't stand a chance.

977
01:13:04,454 --> 01:13:06,688
And if it fails,

978
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:10,190
the blow to the IDF,
to Israel, will be...

979
01:13:10,192 --> 01:13:11,963
catastrophic.

980
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:16,096
Anyway, I am bound
by the Cabinet's decision.

981
01:13:16,098 --> 01:13:19,402
Yitzhak, you are the Cabinet.

982
01:13:23,507 --> 01:13:25,142
Rehearse it.

983
01:13:26,243 --> 01:13:27,511
They already are.

984
01:15:31,133 --> 01:15:34,371
Everybody back
to first position!

985
01:15:37,807 --> 01:15:39,239
I didn't see the signal.

986
01:15:39,241 --> 01:15:40,341
Give me the megaphone.

987
01:15:40,343 --> 01:15:41,443
You're staying first.

988
01:15:41,445 --> 01:15:42,777
You go second.

989
01:15:42,779 --> 01:15:44,778
You're hesitating... again.

990
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:46,449
You go last.

991
01:16:00,429 --> 01:16:01,628
Motta.

992
01:16:03,499 --> 01:16:05,567
I'm going to recommend
the operation

993
01:16:05,569 --> 01:16:08,435
to Rabin and the Cabinet
if he says it's okay.

994
01:16:08,437 --> 01:16:10,273
Can you do it, Yoni?

995
01:16:17,813 --> 01:16:19,447
Is there anything

996
01:16:19,449 --> 01:16:20,782
blocking their path
to the hostages?

997
01:16:20,784 --> 01:16:22,350
No, sir.

998
01:16:22,352 --> 01:16:26,488
There are no obstacles
around the terminal.

999
01:16:26,490 --> 01:16:29,556
Nothing to stop our men
reaching the hostages.

1000
01:16:29,558 --> 01:16:32,226
I want the photograph to reach
the men before they leave.

1001
01:16:32,228 --> 01:16:33,763
Thank you.

1002
01:16:36,732 --> 01:16:39,634
There's nothing to stop
the operation from proceeding.

1003
01:16:39,636 --> 01:16:41,668
So now you have
to make a decision.

1004
01:16:41,670 --> 01:16:43,304
If I was still a general,

1005
01:16:43,306 --> 01:16:45,372
I would never approve
this mission.

1006
01:16:45,374 --> 01:16:47,876
It's a huge risk.

1007
01:16:47,878 --> 01:16:51,645
There will be casualties.
You all know that.

1008
01:16:51,647 --> 01:16:55,649
What we cannot doubt
is the mission.

1009
01:16:55,651 --> 01:16:57,618
We must complete our objective.

1010
01:16:57,620 --> 01:17:00,421
We need to get to the terminal
in three minutes,

1011
01:17:00,423 --> 01:17:03,190
kill all the terrorists
and rescue the hostages.

1012
01:17:03,192 --> 01:17:04,759
And we don't stop for nothing

1013
01:17:04,761 --> 01:17:07,194
until all the hostages
are safe.

1014
01:17:07,196 --> 01:17:09,930
<i>We will take off
and get into striking range</i>

1015
01:17:09,932 --> 01:17:11,866
<i>while we wait
for the Cabinet's decision.</i>

1016
01:17:11,868 --> 01:17:13,234
Let's go.

1017
01:17:13,236 --> 01:17:14,572
Everybody on board.

1018
01:17:50,973 --> 01:17:52,810
Boni.

1019
01:19:30,005 --> 01:19:31,872
- Prime Minister.
- Motta.

1020
01:19:31,874 --> 01:19:33,908
Prime Minister.

1021
01:19:33,910 --> 01:19:37,478
My position is well known
to those in this room.

1022
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:40,047
I am sure that the Cabinet
will support your decision

1023
01:19:40,049 --> 01:19:41,983
and take collective
responsib...

1024
01:19:41,985 --> 01:19:45,319
Shimon, the plane's
already left.

1025
01:19:45,321 --> 01:19:46,988
We'll call them back
if the Cabinet decides

1026
01:19:46,990 --> 01:19:48,588
not to proceed
with the operation.

1027
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:49,924
Motta.

1028
01:19:49,926 --> 01:19:53,094
Do you recommend this operation
to the Cabinet?

1029
01:19:53,096 --> 01:19:54,796
Yes, Prime Minister.

1030
01:19:54,798 --> 01:19:57,064
Gentlemen, Amos will now
read a statement,

1031
01:19:57,066 --> 01:19:58,699
and then we will vote.

1032
01:19:58,701 --> 01:20:00,835
"The government resolves
to approve

1033
01:20:00,837 --> 01:20:02,369
"implementation
of a rescue operation

1034
01:20:02,371 --> 01:20:04,404
"by the Israeli Defense Forces

1035
01:20:04,406 --> 01:20:06,741
"to free the hostages
at Entebbe, according to

1036
01:20:06,743 --> 01:20:08,475
"the plan submitted
by the defense minister

1037
01:20:08,477 --> 01:20:10,677
and the chief of staff."

1038
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:12,449
All those in favor?

1039
01:20:18,687 --> 01:20:21,055
So be it.

1040
01:20:21,057 --> 01:20:24,461
Operation Thunderbolt
will proceed as planned.

1041
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:44,077
Tel Aviv Command Center,

1042
01:20:44,079 --> 01:20:45,912
Thunderbolt is a go.

1043
01:20:45,914 --> 01:20:49,085
I repeat, Thunderbolt is a go.

1044
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:52,854
ETA, Entebbe...

1045
01:20:52,856 --> 01:20:54,622
23:45.

1046
01:20:54,624 --> 01:20:56,660
Minus four hours, 32.

1047
01:21:03,833 --> 01:21:05,699
That's our door.

1048
01:21:05,701 --> 01:21:09,005
It's the fourth
from the control tower.

1049
01:22:20,043 --> 01:22:22,045
Juan Pablo...

1050
01:22:25,882 --> 01:22:28,419
I wish I was at home with you.

1051
01:22:29,919 --> 01:22:32,089
I wish I was at home.

1052
01:22:33,923 --> 01:22:36,560
I don't know where my home is.

1053
01:22:38,828 --> 01:22:41,932
Think we need to find a home
when this is over.

1054
01:22:44,066 --> 01:22:45,802
Somewhere.

1055
01:22:47,603 --> 01:22:49,740
Somewhere peaceful.

1056
01:23:02,651 --> 01:23:05,152
Jaber thinks the Israelis
will come

1057
01:23:05,154 --> 01:23:06,824
and they'll kill us.

1058
01:23:09,092 --> 01:23:12,862
And then if that happens,
we have to make a statement.

1059
01:23:14,263 --> 01:23:16,833
And that's why we are here.

1060
01:23:21,570 --> 01:23:23,973
I'm worried about Bose.

1061
01:23:25,807 --> 01:23:27,677
He's scared.

1062
01:23:29,245 --> 01:23:31,648
He is weak.
You know that.

1063
01:23:33,249 --> 01:23:35,783
They're all scared.

1064
01:23:35,785 --> 01:23:37,721
Even Jaber.

1065
01:23:40,589 --> 01:23:42,758
I'm not scared.

1066
01:23:45,061 --> 01:23:46,830
I see it.

1067
01:23:50,266 --> 01:23:52,503
I see everything now.

1068
01:23:54,837 --> 01:23:57,107
I think maybe you were right.

1069
01:24:00,142 --> 01:24:03,944
But if I never came here,

1070
01:24:03,946 --> 01:24:05,882
what would that mean?

1071
01:24:09,218 --> 01:24:11,622
No, there's nothing you can do.

1072
01:24:13,255 --> 01:24:15,625
There's nothing anyone can do.

1073
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:20,530
There's no escape.

1074
01:24:22,298 --> 01:24:24,034
No escape.

1075
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:33,910
I think maybe
I shouldn't have come.

1076
01:24:37,312 --> 01:24:40,680
- I think maybe I shouldn't have come...
- Miss.

1077
01:24:40,682 --> 01:24:42,850
Those phones are not working.

1078
01:24:42,852 --> 01:24:45,322
There are other telephones
over there.

1079
01:25:01,303 --> 01:25:03,606
Good-bye, Juan Pablo.

1080
01:25:29,432 --> 01:25:32,936
If the mission fails,
submit it.

1081
01:25:38,441 --> 01:25:40,877
And what's your definition
of failure, Prime Minister?

1082
01:25:42,745 --> 01:25:47,081
25 hostages died at Ma'alot,
and it was a disaster.

1083
01:25:47,083 --> 01:25:51,687
This time around,
25 or less will be a success.

1084
01:27:16,405 --> 01:27:18,338
<i>What's the status?</i>

1085
01:27:18,340 --> 01:27:20,274
<i>Last civilian flight
just took off.</i>

1086
01:27:20,276 --> 01:27:23,109
Should be landing
in ten minutes.

1087
01:27:23,111 --> 01:27:25,145
How about the radio
communication?

1088
01:27:25,147 --> 01:27:29,315
There's lots of static,
but they're getting through.

1089
01:27:29,317 --> 01:27:32,051
So... so far, so good.

1090
01:27:32,053 --> 01:27:34,054
Okay, gentlemen.

1091
01:27:34,056 --> 01:27:35,389
This is it.

1092
01:27:59,816 --> 01:28:01,218
Okay.

1093
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:18,966
As soon as we hit the terminal,

1094
01:28:18,968 --> 01:28:20,466
you start shooting
the control tower.

1095
01:28:20,468 --> 01:28:22,101
- Okay. Yeah.
- Yes?

1096
01:28:22,103 --> 01:28:24,840
Surprise and speed is the key.

1097
01:29:20,529 --> 01:29:22,229
Here we go.

1098
01:31:16,145 --> 01:31:17,465
They are reporting gunfire.

1099
01:31:18,547 --> 01:31:20,213
It's too early for gunfire.

1100
01:31:20,215 --> 01:31:21,547
Stop.

1101
01:31:23,419 --> 01:31:25,188
Is that Amin?

1102
01:31:26,621 --> 01:31:27,621
Whatever happens...

1103
01:31:28,790 --> 01:31:30,627
...we did the right thing.

1104
01:31:33,228 --> 01:31:35,362
- It's the Israelis.
- Cover the door.

1105
01:31:35,364 --> 01:31:36,662
Cover the doors!

1106
01:31:36,664 --> 01:31:38,368
Go, go, go!

1107
01:32:07,797 --> 01:32:10,064
Get down.

1108
01:32:10,066 --> 01:32:11,564
Everybody, get down!

1109
01:32:57,379 --> 01:32:58,444
Muki, go.

1110
01:32:58,446 --> 01:33:00,449
Go.

1111
01:33:19,701 --> 01:33:20,900
David, take the door!

1112
01:34:26,869 --> 01:34:29,368
- IDF! Everybody down!
- Move forward!

1113
01:34:29,370 --> 01:34:31,971
Move forward! Move forward!

1114
01:34:31,973 --> 01:34:33,707
Everybody down!

1115
01:34:33,709 --> 01:34:36,542
- Move forward! Move forward!
- Stop! Don't shoot!

1116
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:37,978
- Stop!
- Hostage! Hostage!

1117
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:38,980
Grenade!

1118
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:41,400
We are in the air.

1119
01:36:41,402 --> 01:36:43,903
We have 102 hostages safe
on board.

1120
01:36:43,905 --> 01:36:48,074
I repeat, we have 102 hostages
safe on board.

1121
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:02,891
Congratulations on
your success, Prime Minister.

1122
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:14,400
We saved a hundred lives.

1123
01:37:14,402 --> 01:37:17,069
And we should be proud of that.

1124
01:37:17,071 --> 01:37:19,439
But if we cannot negotiate,
Shimon,

1125
01:37:19,441 --> 01:37:21,444
this war will never end.

1126
