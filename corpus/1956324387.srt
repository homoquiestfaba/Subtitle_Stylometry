Move it!

[police chatter on radio]

13
00:02:30,821 --> 00:02:32,854
- Are we clear in there?
- Yeah.

14
00:02:32,856 --> 00:02:34,558
All right.

15
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:50,740
McCaffrey, it's a mess in there.
Try not to make it worse.

16
00:02:50,742 --> 00:02:52,109
Yeah.

17
00:03:09,594 --> 00:03:11,563
Hey, anyone moved her?

18
00:03:12,831 --> 00:03:15,197
Nope.
There's a burned filter

19
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:17,834
- still in her left hand.
- [grunts]

20
00:03:17,836 --> 00:03:20,538
Boyfriend said he left
her in the bed smokin'.

[sniffs]

22
00:03:24,676 --> 00:03:26,743
Guy with a red hoodie?

23
00:03:26,745 --> 00:03:28,611
Yeah.

24
00:03:28,613 --> 00:03:31,648
Said when he came back,
the place was already burnin'.

25
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,850
Yeah.

26
00:03:33,852 --> 00:03:35,920
Uh, he tried to get to her.

27
00:03:36,788 --> 00:03:38,723
Not a chance.

28
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:45,730
Tequila.

[sniffs]

30
00:03:53,471 --> 00:03:54,772
Well, he's right.

31
00:03:54,774 --> 00:03:57,007
The fire started
in the mattress.

32
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:59,943
Accidental by
smokin' materials.

33
00:03:59,945 --> 00:04:01,712
I didn't say that.

37
00:04:41,554 --> 00:04:43,854
Right now?

38
00:04:43,856 --> 00:04:46,559
- Right before the fire?
- Yeah.

39
00:04:48,527 --> 00:04:49,961
I tried,
but it burnt my hands.

40
00:04:49,963 --> 00:04:52,931
- Thanks, man. I got this.
- Okay.

41
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:55,499
Hey. How you doin'?

42
00:04:55,501 --> 00:04:57,702
I, um...
I'm sorry about your loss.

43
00:04:57,704 --> 00:04:58,870
Thanks.

44
00:04:58,872 --> 00:05:00,939
What's your name, man?

45
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:02,974
I... Dylan.

46
00:05:02,976 --> 00:05:04,909
Sorry, I...

47
00:05:04,911 --> 00:05:06,945
still can't believe it.

48
00:05:06,947 --> 00:05:09,614
It's okay.
I understand.

49
00:05:09,616 --> 00:05:13,585
All right. Dylan,
was your girlfriend in bed alone?

50
00:05:13,587 --> 00:05:15,520
Yeah. Um...

51
00:05:15,522 --> 00:05:18,458
I was watching a movie
on the couch.

52
00:05:19,626 --> 00:05:20,959
Must've fallen asleep.

53
00:05:20,961 --> 00:05:23,862
And by the time I woke up...

54
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:26,664
Yeah. I-I-I get it. I get it.

55
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:30,335
But, you see, the thing about people
burning to death is that they...

56
00:05:30,337 --> 00:05:32,003
they always,
even in their sleep,

57
00:05:32,005 --> 00:05:34,839
reflexively pull away
from the flame.

58
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:36,975
But your girlfriend
didn't.

59
00:05:36,977 --> 00:05:40,545
And also, you know, people don't sleep
in the middle of a king-size bed, right?

60
00:05:40,547 --> 00:05:42,747
They pick one side
or the other.

61
00:05:42,749 --> 00:05:46,051
When somebody lowers an
unconscious person onto a bed,

62
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:48,686
they put 'em in the middle,
'cause it's easier.

63
00:05:48,688 --> 00:05:51,924
So, you got to understand a curious
person like me is left wondering,

64
00:05:51,926 --> 00:05:53,893
when I get this tested,

65
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,997
am I gonna find more
than agave in there?

66
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,900
- [grunts]
- Fucking piece of shit!

67
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,768
Jesus, who are you?

68
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,005
- I'm a fireman.
- [handcuffs cranking]

69
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:50,685
[engine starting]

00:06:52,587 --> 00:06:53,654

[siren wailing]

72
00:07:02,865 --> 00:07:05,566
- Office of Fire Investigation, can I help you?
- Mornin'.

73
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:09,202
- You get any sleep?
- Yeah, sure,

74
00:07:09,204 --> 00:07:12,739
if puttin' my head on the steering
wheel outside for 20 minutes counts.

75
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:15,675
Hey, Sean? Captain
wants to see you.

76
00:07:15,677 --> 00:07:17,811
- What's his name again, Warren?
- Webber.

77
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:20,080
Christ, he's been here a month.
It's Watts.

78
00:07:20,082 --> 00:07:21,884
You two are hopeless.

79
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,919
Hey, Captain.

80
00:07:25,921 --> 00:07:27,754
You want to see me?

81
00:07:27,756 --> 00:07:29,124
Sit down, please.

82
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,127
[sighs]

83
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:36,798
Nice work with
the murdered girlfriend.

84
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,135
You got an attaboy from that
watch lieutenant in Homicide.

85
00:07:41,137 --> 00:07:44,004
Doyle?
Did he choke on it?

86
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:47,141
I got the impression "thank you"
and "Fire Department"

87
00:07:47,143 --> 00:07:49,643
in the same sentence
doesn't come naturally.

88
00:07:49,645 --> 00:07:52,614
Yeah, but we're not really the
Fire Department though, are we?

89
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:59,120
Temporary detail order
for Maggie Rening to OFI.

90
00:07:59,122 --> 00:08:01,756
Finished state arson school,
peace officer certs

91
00:08:01,758 --> 00:08:04,859
and weapon qualifying.

92
00:08:04,861 --> 00:08:07,028
Why are you
tellin' me this?

93
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,697
She's your new partner.

94
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:11,165
What? Hang on.

95
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:13,868
Two-man teams.
That's the rules.

96
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,171
Look, w-w-we've never had
partners before. Why now?

97
00:08:17,173 --> 00:08:21,008
Probably because for too long nobody's
bothered to actually run this unit.

98
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:24,145
Look, the only reason

99
00:08:24,147 --> 00:08:27,048
suppression captains like you
request OFI is

100
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,884
to brush up your resume before
going for Battalion Chief.

101
00:08:29,886 --> 00:08:31,252
And I get it. I do.

102
00:08:31,254 --> 00:08:33,888
But none of you really
understand how we work here,

103
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,990
and if you're like
every other short-termer,

104
00:08:35,992 --> 00:08:40,061
the whole fireman-with-handcuffs thing
probably rubs you wrong on principle.

105
00:08:40,063 --> 00:08:42,164
We offer a pretty good deal.

106
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,932
I mean, you get to sit there all
day studying for your BC exam,

107
00:08:44,934 --> 00:08:46,834
but in return,

108
00:08:46,836 --> 00:08:49,739
let us catch arsonists
our way, okay?

109
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,676
Yeah, I came from Suppression.

110
00:08:54,777 --> 00:08:57,081
You wanna know one of the fires
I worked there?

111
00:08:58,048 --> 00:08:59,682
West Haddon Street.

112
00:09:00,851 --> 00:09:03,185
I know what you did
in that church.

113
00:09:03,187 --> 00:09:06,788
And maybe with your uncle as Assistant Chief
of this unit nobody has the guts to say it,

114
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,724
but I will.

115
00:09:08,726 --> 00:09:11,994
I don't have a problem
with firemen with handcuffs.

116
00:09:11,996 --> 00:09:15,099
I have a problem with firemen
who are a menace.

117
00:09:18,302 --> 00:09:20,202
Hey, for the record,

118
00:09:20,204 --> 00:09:22,237
I've never asked a thing
of my uncle.

119
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:24,174
You can go back to work now.

120
00:09:27,945 --> 00:09:29,845
Hey, Maggie Rening.

121
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:31,048
Yeah.

122
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,854
So let me guess.
Four years on an engine?

123
00:09:37,888 --> 00:09:39,855
Five.

124
00:09:39,857 --> 00:09:42,193
Do you actually know anything
about this work?

125
00:09:45,596 --> 00:09:47,198
Arson bad, right?

126
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:58,607
- [boy] Hey, wait up!
- Stop!

127
00:09:58,609 --> 00:10:01,878
Come on. We gotta hit
the Hunters before dark.

128
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,314
Hurry up, lazybones!

129
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:10,989
[boy 2] I'll trade you one
candy bar for that jawbreaker.

130
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,357
Come on.
Your turn to knock.

131
00:10:14,359 --> 00:10:18,930
Hey, ask her for extra.
Hey, ask her for extra.

132
00:10:23,868 --> 00:10:25,802
[boy]
Miss Hunter? We're here.

133
00:10:25,804 --> 00:10:28,171
[boy 2]
Eric, knock louder.

134
00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:30,173
- Eric, knock again.
- Is anyone home?

135
00:10:30,175 --> 00:10:32,308
- Louder!
- Try the door!

136
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,279
I hope Mrs. Hunter
made cookies.

137
00:10:36,181 --> 00:10:37,246
Walk into their house.

138
00:10:37,248 --> 00:10:39,918
[all] Trick or treat!

139
00:10:42,887 --> 00:10:45,123
Mrs. Hunter?

140
00:10:53,432 --> 00:10:57,434
[car alarms wailing]

141
00:10:57,436 --> 00:11:01,071
- [man shouting, indistinct]
- [bell jingles]

142
00:11:01,073 --> 00:11:03,075
- There you go, sir.
- [Sean] Thanks.

143
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,849
[man] Extra lamb spleen,
right?

144
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:14,351
[chuckles] Can't believe
you're still wearin' that coat.

145
00:11:14,353 --> 00:11:16,822
He was my father.

146
00:11:17,923 --> 00:11:19,859
And he was my brother.

147
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:23,329
You stalkin' me?

148
00:11:25,264 --> 00:11:28,198
Doesn't take Sherlock
Holmes to find you.

149
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,368
All you gotta do is follow the
stench of the Sean lunch special.

150
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:34,073
- This conversation have a point?
- Yeah.

151
00:11:35,207 --> 00:11:36,376
Yeah.

152
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,210
[sighs]

153
00:11:40,212 --> 00:11:44,984
You can't keep breakin' balls for every
single captain who does a spin down at Arson.

154
00:11:46,118 --> 00:11:48,954
And is this my uncle
or AC talkin'?

155
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:51,922
Take your pick.

156
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:56,127
[scoffs] Eh, well, I'm a big boy.
I can handle him.

157
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:58,898
Who's increasingly isolating
himself down there.

158
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,068
[sirens chirping]

159
00:12:04,371 --> 00:12:05,906
Well...

160
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,909
I didn't join
for the bowling league.

161
00:12:09,376 --> 00:12:11,111
See ya around.

162
00:12:14,014 --> 00:12:15,248
[door bell jingles]

163
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,186
We got a hit.

164
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:29,229
[siren wailing]

165
00:12:48,014 --> 00:12:49,215
Okay.

166
00:12:49,217 --> 00:12:50,982
Don't talk.
Just listen to me,

167
00:12:50,984 --> 00:12:53,452
the building, the fire,
everything, okay?

168
00:12:53,454 --> 00:12:55,122
Yes?

169
00:12:58,326 --> 00:13:01,427
Yo. Five so far.

170
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:04,563
All kids outside
trick or treatin'.

171
00:13:04,565 --> 00:13:07,068
One, we think,
tried the door handle, and, uh...

172
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:10,202
- Christ.
- Yeah.

173
00:13:10,204 --> 00:13:12,204
[man] Let's go.
We're packin' up here.

174
00:13:12,206 --> 00:13:14,342
- Yo, we clear in there?
- Yeah, we're clear.

175
00:13:17,478 --> 00:13:20,379
[firefighter] Break those couplings.
Roll the wet stuff.

176
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:23,217
[helicopter approaching]

177
00:13:25,253 --> 00:13:27,286
No sign of
an incendiary device,

178
00:13:27,288 --> 00:13:29,522
yet the door blew
when they opened it.

179
00:13:29,524 --> 00:13:32,258
So, a backdraft.

180
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,562
Hey. If you can't just listen to the
building before you're even in it,

181
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,397
you may as well
do us both a favor

182
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,566
and go wait in the truck.
All right?

183
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:43,505
[firefighter] Six, get your ladders picked
up and give 17 a hand with any hoses.

184
00:14:06,328 --> 00:14:09,097
Okay, Rening.
So, what are you thinkin'?

185
00:14:10,365 --> 00:14:12,234
Electrical short
in the plug.

186
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:15,268
Well, the fire certainly
visited the plug,

187
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,404
but there's no way
it started there.

188
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:20,440
Intense heat crazing,
V-shaped smoke stain.

189
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,342
It checks a lot of boxes.

190
00:14:22,344 --> 00:14:25,145
[sighs] Well, checklists only
cover the physics of the fire.

191
00:14:25,147 --> 00:14:27,514
You also have to understand
what it wants.

192
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:29,883
Nothin' around that plug
that would excite a fire,

193
00:14:29,885 --> 00:14:32,220
and this fire was excited.

194
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:36,156
Look at the glass.

195
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:38,091
If the fire did actually
start in the plug,

196
00:14:38,093 --> 00:14:39,427
it would've lingered there
for a while,

197
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:42,430
got the lay of the land,
looked for more fuel.

198
00:14:42,432 --> 00:14:46,132
That would've melted
the glass evenly,

199
00:14:46,134 --> 00:14:48,402
not lopsided like that.

200
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:53,139
That requires extreme heat
comin' from one direction.

201
00:14:53,141 --> 00:14:54,608
You know what?
You're right.

202
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:57,244
The fire did visit the plug,

203
00:14:57,246 --> 00:15:00,514
but it's either a side effect
of the real deal,

204
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:04,318
or someone pre-rigged it to
make us think it started there.

205
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,154
The lower half of the room
where our plug is

206
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,523
isn't as burned
as the upper walls.

207
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:13,227
Means the fire spent
more time high than low,

208
00:15:13,229 --> 00:15:16,065
so it must have
entered high somehow.

209
00:15:18,267 --> 00:15:19,467
Wait a second.

210
00:15:19,469 --> 00:15:21,371
The fire didn't start
in the room.

211
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,442
It came in through the ducts
from somewhere else.

212
00:15:35,385 --> 00:15:37,218
Pooling.

213
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,624
Hot enough to scar metal,
but leave no molten trace.

214
00:15:47,464 --> 00:15:49,299
Watch your step.

215
00:15:53,303 --> 00:15:55,704
That's the furnace.

216
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:58,375
The ignition point's
at the bottom of that mess.

217
00:16:00,177 --> 00:16:01,378
[sighs]

218
00:16:02,979 --> 00:16:05,747
- Get digging.
- Thanks.

219
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:07,682
Well, enjoy.

220
00:16:07,684 --> 00:16:09,251
And you?

221
00:16:09,253 --> 00:16:11,388
Me? I'm gonna get dessert.

222
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,191
[cars honking]

223
00:16:16,193 --> 00:16:18,228
Watch your backs.

224
00:16:20,264 --> 00:16:23,298
So, I got four unsolved kids
on my desk, or what?

225
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,268
If you could count, that's five.
And I don't know yet.

226
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,539
Mm. They burn,
they're yours.

227
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:40,415
A lot of dead kids.

228
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,417
Yeah, too many.

229
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,554
Anybody found
the owners yet?

230
00:16:44,556 --> 00:16:46,422
Looks like
nobody was home.

231
00:16:46,424 --> 00:16:48,693
Touhy's runnin' down
title records.

232
00:16:50,528 --> 00:16:53,296
Listen, we can't let this become a shit
show with the press. You understand?

233
00:16:53,298 --> 00:16:57,032
So, what I need from you ASAP is
cause, all right?

234
00:16:57,034 --> 00:16:59,304
Was it homicide,
was it arson?

235
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,039
Yeah.

236
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,443
Hey.

237
00:17:07,278 --> 00:17:09,180
Are we
on the same page?

238
00:17:10,315 --> 00:17:11,316
[sighs]

239
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,750
It started in
the air conditioning.

240
00:17:14,752 --> 00:17:17,288
Then used the ducts
to get through the house.

241
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:20,725
- [scoffs]
- I need a little light.

242
00:17:23,761 --> 00:17:26,197
Breaker didn't trip.

243
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:31,835
The plastic sheathing on
the calibration screw's missing.

244
00:17:31,837 --> 00:17:35,608
Set wrong, it could cause a power
surge and overload the mechanism.

245
00:17:37,576 --> 00:17:41,477
Discoloration shows that this cable here
experienced the highest temperatures.

246
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:45,616
Now, if the heat source came from within
the cable, as an electrical overload,

247
00:17:45,618 --> 00:17:48,418
it would melt the plastic
insulation against it.

248
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:53,390
But if not, then the heat source
came from outside the cable,

249
00:17:53,392 --> 00:17:55,561
as in a splash of gasoline.

250
00:18:00,699 --> 00:18:01,765
[buzzing]

251
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:03,867
Somebody splashed it.

252
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:07,771
Looks like somebody splashed it to make
it look like an accidental overload,

253
00:18:07,773 --> 00:18:10,507
if nobody bought the shorted
plug in the other room

254
00:18:10,509 --> 00:18:12,545
as an ignition point.

255
00:18:15,714 --> 00:18:18,651
Chief McCaffrey,
is he your uncle?

256
00:18:19,818 --> 00:18:21,685
Yeah, technically.

257
00:18:21,687 --> 00:18:23,821
What do we got?

258
00:18:23,823 --> 00:18:26,657
Or not?

259
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:30,427
Medical examiner's only done soot-or-shot
prelims on the bodies so far.

260
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:33,330
We got five males
all under 15.

261
00:18:33,332 --> 00:18:34,498
Hmm.

262
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,333
What killed them?

263
00:18:36,335 --> 00:18:40,437
In the prelim opinion of the ME
the fire killed 'em.

264
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:42,807
All right,
that's five deaths on us.

265
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:45,677
Or, uh, you to be exact.

266
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,848
Well, if it's fire,
I think I'm done here?

267
00:18:51,585 --> 00:18:55,320
- What do you think, Sean? Murder?
- It's too early.

268
00:18:55,322 --> 00:18:57,889
But I got to tell you, I'm going to have
a hard time callin' "accidental" on this.

269
00:18:57,891 --> 00:18:59,791
What I don't
got to tell ya is

270
00:18:59,793 --> 00:19:01,759
that there ain't a single
Naugahyde jockey down at City Hall

271
00:19:01,761 --> 00:19:04,161
that wants to call this arson.

272
00:19:04,163 --> 00:19:06,798
Not the mayor, who's already got a serious
problem with his homicide rate this year,

273
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,435
not the PD
and sure as hell not us.

274
00:19:10,437 --> 00:19:13,738
- ATF comin' in on this?
- [chuckles] No.

275
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,175
I think it's safe to say that Sean
buggered that relationship for all time.

276
00:19:17,177 --> 00:19:19,477
Who, Kunz?
The guy's an asshole.

277
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:22,447
He couldn't pour piss out of a turn-out
boot with the instructions on the heel.

278
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:23,715
What about the family?

279
00:19:23,717 --> 00:19:27,452
The Hunters, Rod and Jan,
married, no kids.

280
00:19:27,454 --> 00:19:28,821
We can't find them yet.

281
00:19:28,823 --> 00:19:31,356
I'll tell ya what
we're not gonna do.

282
00:19:31,358 --> 00:19:34,695
Until we find the Hunters and we have a
solid determination on cause and origin...

283
00:19:35,495 --> 00:19:36,962
we're not gonna say shit.

284
00:19:36,964 --> 00:19:39,634
Nobody utters the "A" word,
got it?

285
00:19:40,467 --> 00:19:42,801
Now, tell me one true thing.

286
00:19:42,803 --> 00:19:44,903
Canvass gave us a lot
of half-sentences.

287
00:19:44,905 --> 00:19:47,773
There's maybe a gang
hitting houses in the area.

288
00:19:47,775 --> 00:19:50,476
The DOT camera
at the intersection

289
00:19:50,478 --> 00:19:52,411
might give us
video surveillance of a car.

290
00:19:52,413 --> 00:19:54,713
You ID the car, you move.

291
00:19:54,715 --> 00:19:58,617
I want these jag-offs
off the street instantly.

292
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:00,452
Right? Mm.

293
00:20:00,454 --> 00:20:02,220
Sure.

294
00:20:02,222 --> 00:20:03,758
By the way...

295
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:05,793
who are you?

296
00:20:06,627 --> 00:20:07,895
Maggie Rening.

297
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:13,401
- Rening?
- She's detailed to Sean.

298
00:20:14,502 --> 00:20:15,868
Rening.

299
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,471
Well, that's...
That's a beautiful thing.

300
00:20:19,473 --> 00:20:23,842
Now the OFI is officially
the Island of Broken Toys.

301
00:20:23,844 --> 00:20:27,680
Freaks who did this with a ribbon on
top, before we say a word.

302
00:20:27,682 --> 00:20:28,783
Yep.

303
00:20:43,431 --> 00:20:45,598
Whoa, whoa.

304
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,033
[barking]

305
00:20:47,035 --> 00:20:49,903
Hey, I get growled at
enough at work. All right?

306
00:20:49,905 --> 00:20:51,673
[whimpering]

307
00:21:14,696 --> 00:21:16,696

I just don't buy you were drawn

Not on your own.

330
00:23:04,141 --> 00:23:06,643
You don't hunt that way.

331
00:23:18,088 --> 00:23:19,590
Oh, shit.

332
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:22,593
They made you lie.

333
00:23:23,827 --> 00:23:24,995
All right.

334
00:23:41,445 --> 00:23:43,114
[low growl]

335
00:23:44,648 --> 00:23:47,986
What? What, are you movin' in?
How'd you get...

336
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:51,187
Burnin' things
don't bother you, huh?

337
00:23:51,189 --> 00:23:52,889
[growling]

338
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:56,058
Hey! No more of that,
all right?

339
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,094
- No more of that.
- [whimpers]

340
00:23:58,096 --> 00:24:00,932
Yeah, that's better.
There you go.

341
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:03,833
Okay, this isn't
what it looks like.

342
00:24:03,835 --> 00:24:06,971
I'm just randomly throwin'
food out there, all right?

343
00:24:09,173 --> 00:24:11,941
Rening. Rening.

344
00:24:11,943 --> 00:24:14,010
You know, I did my homework.

345
00:24:14,012 --> 00:24:16,246
There was a firefighter
named Rening, right,

346
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:20,650
who got two commendations in a single
year for makin' live snatches in fires.

347
00:24:20,652 --> 00:24:23,486
I mean, wow, that's gotta be
some kind of record, right?

348
00:24:23,488 --> 00:24:25,088
It isn't.

349
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:28,258
People don't join the fire
department to carry a gun.

350
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:32,695
They move to OFI either because they're so
busted up they can't do line work anymore,

351
00:24:32,697 --> 00:24:35,831
or they can't get arson out of their
bones, and you clearly aren't either.

352
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,167
Yeah?
Well, which are you?

353
00:24:37,169 --> 00:24:40,770
Me? I rise above
all categories.

354
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:42,740
Maybe you're both.

355
00:24:44,176 --> 00:24:45,911
Why are you here,
Rening?

356
00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:56,119
[sighs]

357
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:58,057
[door opens]

358
00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:01,226
They didn't do it.

359
00:25:02,695 --> 00:25:04,795
Lieutenant Doyle ID'd
their plate near the scene

360
00:25:04,797 --> 00:25:05,963
off the intersection camera.

361
00:25:05,965 --> 00:25:08,265
They had gas
and pry bars in the car.

362
00:25:08,267 --> 00:25:10,934
Look, I don't doubt these yo-yos
were up to something, somewhere,

363
00:25:10,936 --> 00:25:13,203
but it wasn't that building.

364
00:25:13,205 --> 00:25:15,072
Oh, what makes you
so sure?

365
00:25:15,074 --> 00:25:18,075
Because these goofballs
had gasoline in the car.

366
00:25:18,077 --> 00:25:20,010
Gasoline's amateur hour.

367
00:25:20,012 --> 00:25:23,013
It burns twice as hot,
bashes around like a bull in a china shop,

368
00:25:23,015 --> 00:25:25,549
and puts itself out
in half the time.

369
00:25:25,551 --> 00:25:28,086
Look, gas chromatograph
came back on the wiring

370
00:25:28,088 --> 00:25:31,222
and there's benzyl-nitrate
all over it, not gasoline,

371
00:25:31,224 --> 00:25:35,226
with just enough sprinkles
of linoleum to, uh, hide the BZ,

372
00:25:35,228 --> 00:25:37,161
but not enough
to confirm a splash.

373
00:25:37,163 --> 00:25:39,230
Now, BZ is
what the pros use, okay?

374
00:25:39,232 --> 00:25:42,300
It burns cool, takes longer to
bite, but when it does,

375
00:25:42,302 --> 00:25:45,103
it holds on like a Gila monster.

376
00:25:45,105 --> 00:25:49,974
Whoever did this is smart enough
to try and fake a fried plug,

377
00:25:49,976 --> 00:25:51,943
is also smart enough

378
00:25:51,945 --> 00:25:55,113
to throw us a basement breaker
panel overload if we got past that,

379
00:25:55,115 --> 00:25:59,050
and smarter still to trick the fire
using the BZ up into the ducting

380
00:25:59,052 --> 00:26:03,154
while hiding it with
linoleum hydrocarbon signatures.

381
00:26:03,156 --> 00:26:06,124
Whoever did this is smarter than
anyone I've come up against.

382
00:26:06,126 --> 00:26:07,992
Not the smartest.

383
00:26:07,994 --> 00:26:10,764
He's been locked up
behind bars for decades.

384
00:26:12,065 --> 00:26:14,000
Ronald Bartel.

385
00:26:15,268 --> 00:26:17,904
Takes it
to a whole 'nother level.

386
00:26:18,872 --> 00:26:21,139
- Ronald Bartel.
- Don't worry about it.

387
00:26:21,141 --> 00:26:24,609
Hey, Doyle.
The Hunters are still missing.

388
00:26:24,611 --> 00:26:26,278
I feel your pain.

389
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,980
Okay, well I need you to put
more manpower into finding them.

390
00:26:28,982 --> 00:26:31,250
Why would I go anywhere near it?
They burn, they're yours.

391
00:26:31,252 --> 00:26:33,085
One of the kids
didn't die by fire.

392
00:26:33,087 --> 00:26:36,055
What? I thought you were
selling a backdraft for them.

393
00:26:36,057 --> 00:26:38,290
The door killed him.
That's blunt force trauma.

394
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:40,893
[laughs] No, you wouldn't.
Not even you.

395
00:26:40,895 --> 00:26:44,932
What, you wanna see how many of those
little souls I can dump in your lap? Hmm?

396
00:26:46,033 --> 00:26:49,236
- Okay. I'll put a team on it.
- Attaboy.

397
00:26:52,139 --> 00:26:55,274
Ah, Jesus Christ.
What are you doin' here, Kunz?

398
00:26:55,276 --> 00:26:57,209
I thought you'd be workin'
igloo fires in Alaska

399
00:26:57,211 --> 00:26:59,411
after the last
fucked-up call you made.

400
00:26:59,413 --> 00:27:01,814
ATF, OFI Insurance Task Force.

401
00:27:01,816 --> 00:27:04,983
- What, and they put you on it?
- Well, who they didn't was you.

402
00:27:04,985 --> 00:27:06,852
- Who's this?
- Maggie Rening.

403
00:27:06,854 --> 00:27:08,921
Hi. So what are you doin'
stickin' your beak into my fire?

404
00:27:08,923 --> 00:27:11,657
High-profile burn. It makes sense
the city might want a second opinion.

405
00:27:11,659 --> 00:27:14,059
Oh, and the ATF just happens
to have enough budget

406
00:27:14,061 --> 00:27:17,896
to randomly throw extra man
hours at somebody else's fire?

407
00:27:17,898 --> 00:27:21,234
Two guys walk into a building.
One walks out.

408
00:27:21,236 --> 00:27:24,670
You know something, Kunz?
You always trusted your CIs too much.

409
00:27:24,672 --> 00:27:26,905
You know what,
I still clear cases.

410
00:27:26,907 --> 00:27:28,874
And I do it
without jerking off to fire.

411
00:27:28,876 --> 00:27:31,211
Yeah, yeah.
Stay away from my burn.

412
00:27:31,213 --> 00:27:34,082
You always make
this many friends in a day?

413
00:27:44,192 --> 00:27:46,359
Hey, I was just
headin' out to dinner.

414
00:27:46,361 --> 00:27:48,330
Thought you might
wanna come.

415
00:27:49,164 --> 00:27:50,999
Ah, I got plans.

416
00:27:52,334 --> 00:27:54,202
It's your mother's
birthday.

417
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,239
Well, send my best.

418
00:28:00,308 --> 00:28:02,375
You'll be missed.

419
00:28:02,377 --> 00:28:04,377
Again.

420
00:28:04,379 --> 00:28:07,046
Yeah. Well,
talk to her husband about that.

421
00:28:07,048 --> 00:28:08,383
Mm.

422
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:13,253
[sighs]

423
00:28:13,255 --> 00:28:16,392
[Brian] You know, Sean,
I think about those days...

424
00:28:19,995 --> 00:28:21,663
about your dad...

425
00:28:24,032 --> 00:28:25,366
all the time.

426
00:28:25,368 --> 00:28:27,501
Ahh. Yeah.

427
00:28:27,503 --> 00:28:30,504
Well, thanks for tryin'
to take the shot.

428
00:28:30,506 --> 00:28:32,375
I'll call Mom.

429
00:28:33,342 --> 00:28:35,111
But you still
won't come.

430
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:37,446
Like I said, I got plans.

431
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:55,464
[Asian harp music]

432
00:28:56,432 --> 00:28:58,234
You scare him, you know.

433
00:29:00,203 --> 00:29:02,138
I'm sorry, what?

434
00:29:03,139 --> 00:29:05,041
That old man.

435
00:29:05,975 --> 00:29:07,975
Oh, no.
We're friends.

436
00:29:07,977 --> 00:29:11,546
I come here all the time.
Uh, he owns the place.

437
00:29:11,548 --> 00:29:15,182
I've, uh,
seen you here before.

438
00:29:15,184 --> 00:29:16,919
He's freaked out by you.

439
00:29:17,421 --> 00:29:19,387
Uh, no.

440
00:29:19,389 --> 00:29:22,189
I helped him out
a while back.

441
00:29:22,191 --> 00:29:23,960
We're buddies.

442
00:29:24,794 --> 00:29:27,127
Helped him, huh?

443
00:29:27,129 --> 00:29:28,931
Please, tell me.

444
00:29:30,234 --> 00:29:31,968
How?

445
00:29:33,537 --> 00:29:38,073
Uh, well, he kept
havin' kitchen fires.

446
00:29:38,075 --> 00:29:40,808
Um, so I staked it out

447
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:43,478
and found out it was a
competing diner down the street

448
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,016
pouring grease
down the roof exhaust so...

449
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:49,084
Caught the bad guys.
That's it.

450
00:29:49,086 --> 00:29:52,254
- And the owner was grateful.
- Yeah, sure.

451
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:56,224
- So he told you to come by.
- Yeah. I can think here.

452
00:29:56,226 --> 00:29:59,227
So you do, come by any time?

453
00:29:59,229 --> 00:30:01,363
Whoa, sorr... I'm sorry.
Who... Who are you?

454
00:30:01,365 --> 00:30:03,098
Jenny.

455
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,132
Are you a cop?

456
00:30:04,134 --> 00:30:06,167
Uh, fireman.

457
00:30:06,169 --> 00:30:10,272
Well, sort of.
Arson investigator. You?

458
00:30:10,274 --> 00:30:12,007
Geologist.

459
00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:15,010
[chuckles] Come on, really?

460
00:30:15,012 --> 00:30:18,113
Okay. All right.
Wow. Geologist.

461
00:30:18,115 --> 00:30:21,051
So, uh, how do you know
old Tommy over there?

462
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:24,288
'Cause he's my father.

463
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,356
Oh, shit. Uh...

464
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,024
We don't talk anymore.

465
00:30:29,026 --> 00:30:31,396
Oh, you just hang out here?

466
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:34,497
Pop quiz.
Who are you?

467
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,232
- Oh. Really?
- Really.

468
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:37,866
Oh, wow. Okay.

469
00:30:37,868 --> 00:30:41,170
Um, well, uh,

470
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:44,140
I'm the son and grandson
of dead firemen.

471
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:46,575
I investigate arson,

472
00:30:46,577 --> 00:30:51,247
not because I like fire,
but because I understand it.

473
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:54,419
A distinction without a difference
to some of the people I work with.

474
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:56,652
What about you?

475
00:30:56,654 --> 00:31:01,223
Uh, I am the only daughter
of a traditional father

476
00:31:01,225 --> 00:31:05,061
who has disowned me
because I'm 30, unmarried,

477
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:08,297
and work looking for oil in the
employ of foreign billionaires,

478
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:11,635
which basically, in his eyes,
makes me an escort.

479
00:31:11,637 --> 00:31:14,504
I burned my stepfather's
house down when I was a kid.

480
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:17,543
- 'Cause you understand fire, not like it, right?
- Ooh. Touché.

481
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,478
Uh, my father thinks

482
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,181
I'm the re-incarnated son
that he lost in a miscarriage.

483
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:29,355
Last time I saw my father alive we were
makin' breakfast for my mom in the kitchen.

484
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:32,491
I can't remember
the last time I saw my mother.

485
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:38,062

scared of or for me.

- I'm better.

Ooh, shit.

490
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,411
Uh, did that just blow it?

what the PD has on them.

but dropped it.

they carry.

Give me the hose!

519
00:33:25,773 --> 00:33:27,173
Come on!

520
00:33:31,244 --> 00:33:32,746
Stay there! Don't move!

521
00:33:37,785 --> 00:33:40,187
Stop!

522
00:33:41,722 --> 00:33:43,524
I said, stop!

523
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,994
Don't move!

524
00:33:50,464 --> 00:33:52,064
- Freeze!
- Dude! Son of a bitch!

525
00:33:52,066 --> 00:33:54,368
- Freeze! Freeze!
- [screams]

526
00:33:55,569 --> 00:33:57,569
Pull back.

527
00:33:57,571 --> 00:33:59,371
[man screams]

528
00:33:59,373 --> 00:34:02,441
I told you, if you ever do that
again, I will kill you!

529
00:34:02,443 --> 00:34:04,778
- You stupid, dumb, mother...
- Stop! Stop!

530
00:34:06,347 --> 00:34:07,847
- [groans]
- You pathetic...

531
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:10,516
you for-hire torches,
you really think fire dances for you?

532
00:34:10,518 --> 00:34:12,484
Piece of shit!

533
00:34:12,486 --> 00:34:14,553
Geez, Sean!

534
00:34:14,555 --> 00:34:16,789
It's impossible to bust these assholes
without catchin' them in the act,

535
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:18,858
and I had just about enough
of this piece of shit.

536
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,093
Sean, get a medic!

537
00:34:21,095 --> 00:34:23,498
You hurt him.
Get an ambulance!

538
00:34:24,733 --> 00:34:27,867
So you really pre-weaken roof
beams on your fires, huh?

539
00:34:27,869 --> 00:34:31,740
It brings 'em down fast.
The clients like that.

540
00:34:33,742 --> 00:34:36,309
No roof also means an insurance
total on the building.

541
00:34:36,311 --> 00:34:37,777
It also traps firefighters.

542
00:34:37,779 --> 00:34:41,447
I only do commercial vacants.
I don't kill people.

543
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:43,383
It's nice to know there's
still standards in the world.

544
00:34:43,385 --> 00:34:46,286
Yeah, not like that freak show
in Lincoln Park.

545
00:34:46,288 --> 00:34:47,420
[groans]

546
00:34:47,422 --> 00:34:49,257
The Halloween fire?

547
00:34:50,325 --> 00:34:53,526
I wouldn't touch that
for three times the fee.

548
00:34:53,528 --> 00:34:57,564
Did someone offer you a fee
for the Lincoln Park fires?

549
00:34:57,566 --> 00:34:59,534
Look, it was just in the wind.

550
00:35:01,303 --> 00:35:05,405
All right, but like I said,
I don't burn people.

551
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:08,809
Our Sean-Fuckin'-McCaffrey has
torched more guys than I have.

552
00:35:08,811 --> 00:35:11,611
This offer in the wind,

553
00:35:11,613 --> 00:35:13,680
it say why it wanted
the nice house burned?

554
00:35:13,682 --> 00:35:16,618
This guy knew his arson.

555
00:35:18,688 --> 00:35:20,790
It was twisted stuff.

556
00:35:21,691 --> 00:35:24,424
[grunting]

557
00:35:24,426 --> 00:35:26,459
You and Matchstick Charlie
have a nice little chat?

558
00:35:26,461 --> 00:35:29,530
Somebody was tryin' to hire out
a burn on our townhouse.

559
00:35:29,532 --> 00:35:31,498
That pissant
said that to you?

560
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,336
I wasn't the one pushin' him through
a window, so yeah, I guess so.

561
00:35:36,171 --> 00:35:39,440
Excuse me. I need to speak to the
guy they brought in from the fire?

562
00:35:39,442 --> 00:35:41,477
Not until
he's been treated.

563
00:35:42,445 --> 00:35:43,679
Okay.

564
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,849
[man]
He won't talk to you.

565
00:35:48,718 --> 00:35:51,452
Oh, yeah? Why not?

566
00:35:51,454 --> 00:35:55,356
- Because I told him not to.
- Shit.

567
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:58,459
There you go. Hi, Sean.

568
00:35:58,461 --> 00:36:01,462
- Who's this?
- This is Ronald Bartel,

569
00:36:01,464 --> 00:36:03,932
deadliest arsonist in the city
since Mrs. O'Leary's cow.

570
00:36:03,934 --> 00:36:06,367
Moo.

571
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:09,436
Nursing homes, orphanages, probably a
hundred others we'll never know about

572
00:36:09,438 --> 00:36:12,608
since Ronald's specialty's
makin' them look like accidents.

573
00:36:13,609 --> 00:36:15,744
The littlest McCaffrey.

574
00:36:15,746 --> 00:36:17,979
You never came to see me.

575
00:36:17,981 --> 00:36:19,714
Your Uncle Brian did.

576
00:36:19,716 --> 00:36:22,751
So, what are you doin'
out of your cage, hmm?

577
00:36:22,753 --> 00:36:25,654
I hoarded a lot of sugar.

578
00:36:25,656 --> 00:36:27,856
Ate it all at once.

579
00:36:27,858 --> 00:36:29,591
I'm diabetic.

580
00:36:29,593 --> 00:36:33,628
It's my secret
get-out-of-jail-free card.

581
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:36,698
Sit.
We have so much to talk about.

582
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,167
Yeah.

583
00:36:40,637 --> 00:36:42,372
Lincoln Park?

584
00:36:44,675 --> 00:36:46,574
[laughs]

585
00:36:46,576 --> 00:36:49,944
You can't make your fire
work, can you?

586
00:36:49,946 --> 00:36:52,781
You know in your bones
it has to be arson,

587
00:36:52,783 --> 00:36:56,618
but you can't prove it,
and that's eating you alive.

588
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,720
- Go wait in the truck.
- What?

589
00:36:58,722 --> 00:37:00,655
Do it.

590
00:37:00,657 --> 00:37:02,559
This is absurd.

591
00:37:04,695 --> 00:37:06,861
She's an arson
investigator?

592
00:37:06,863 --> 00:37:09,932
No!
She doesn't have the look.

593
00:37:09,934 --> 00:37:12,667
Not like Rimgale did.

594
00:37:12,669 --> 00:37:14,870
Not like you do.

595
00:37:14,872 --> 00:37:17,006
How do you know
about my fire?

596
00:37:17,008 --> 00:37:20,644
Oh, there are lots of us around and about
who have an interest in such things.

597
00:37:21,746 --> 00:37:24,714
Some are guests of the State,
but some are not.

598
00:37:24,716 --> 00:37:29,284
And some of them are surprisingly
good at hacking databases.

599
00:37:29,286 --> 00:37:31,620
OFI's, for instance.

600
00:37:31,622 --> 00:37:37,560
They hacked OFI's photos, reports,
conjectures, and then they share them.

601
00:37:37,562 --> 00:37:38,828
Yeah.

602
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:42,898
Want to share with me, Sean?
Come on.

603
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,700
[chuckles]

604
00:37:44,702 --> 00:37:46,971
All right, I'll share first.

605
00:37:48,306 --> 00:37:50,606
Lincoln Park.

606
00:37:50,608 --> 00:37:52,675
I read OFI's report,

607
00:37:52,677 --> 00:37:55,745
and they said...
[chuckling]

608
00:37:55,747 --> 00:37:58,948
there was
a "single ignition source."

609
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:01,951
That's idiocy.

610
00:38:01,953 --> 00:38:04,787
Didn't they look at your pictures?
I did.

611
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:08,858
So much heat, Sean,
driven through the ducting so fast

612
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:13,696
that it gobbled up enough oxygen
to create a backdraft.

613
00:38:13,698 --> 00:38:17,733
Somebody's got a secret
in there.

614
00:38:17,735 --> 00:38:20,669
And you know what, Ronald?
You're gonna tell me.

615
00:38:20,671 --> 00:38:22,873
[laughs]

616
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:25,742
No. Sharing's a process,

617
00:38:25,744 --> 00:38:28,479
and we take turns.

618
00:38:30,582 --> 00:38:32,816
That was my turn to share.

619
00:38:32,818 --> 00:38:34,885
Now it's yours.

620
00:38:34,887 --> 00:38:39,057
I want you to share with me
a fire at, um...

621
00:38:40,993 --> 00:38:44,060
West Haddon Street.
[laughs]

622
00:38:44,062 --> 00:38:47,130
By the time you finally
cornered Wicek in there,

623
00:38:47,132 --> 00:38:49,733
he'd burned down
how many churches by then?

624
00:38:49,735 --> 00:38:51,568
Eight, right?

625
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:54,070
You paused when you saw it,
didn't you?

626
00:38:54,072 --> 00:38:58,542
Just for an instant.
Just to admire it.

627
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:03,814
Because Wicek had created
a... a real work of art.

628
00:39:03,816 --> 00:39:06,083
And he brought out the dragon.

629
00:39:06,085 --> 00:39:11,055
The dragon was talking to you,
Sean, and you were listening,

630
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:15,061
and you understood
what the dragon was saying.

631
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:17,128
Huh, sure...

632
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:19,565
sure you paused.

633
00:39:20,666 --> 00:39:22,634
You couldn't resist.

634
00:39:23,837 --> 00:39:27,939
[gasped]
God, to have been there.

635
00:39:27,941 --> 00:39:31,578
The greatest arson duel
in history.

636
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,081
Oh. Oh. Oh.

637
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,986
Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.

638
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:44,991
Mm. I have one more question.

639
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:49,028
Isn't it my turn
for questions?

640
00:39:50,196 --> 00:39:53,967
Yeah. Okay. All right.
I'll ask it after.

641
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:59,971
To get that much heat moving
that fast through the ducting

642
00:39:59,973 --> 00:40:03,943
would've required the laying out
of additional accelerant.

643
00:40:05,011 --> 00:40:07,881
But you didn't see
any signs of that, did you?

644
00:40:08,848 --> 00:40:11,682
So, the answer had to be,

645
00:40:11,684 --> 00:40:13,720
a second ignition source.

646
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:19,960
But you looked for it and you
couldn't find it, could you?

647
00:40:20,961 --> 00:40:24,196
And you checked for everything.

648
00:40:24,198 --> 00:40:27,167
Absolutely everything.

649
00:40:28,869 --> 00:40:33,038
Did you check for
celluloid and mercury?

650
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,707
[laughs]

651
00:40:35,709 --> 00:40:38,143
See?
Sharing can be good for you.

652
00:40:38,145 --> 00:40:42,214
W-W-Wait!
I said I had a question!

653
00:40:42,216 --> 00:40:45,753
I know how lonely it can be
for a person like you.

654
00:40:49,023 --> 00:40:50,923
Did you and Ronald
catch up on old times?

655
00:40:50,925 --> 00:40:54,026
Hey, listen.
Those circular burns on the ducts?

656
00:40:54,028 --> 00:40:58,163
They were made by a one-time cell
igniter powered by a micro-battery.

657
00:40:58,165 --> 00:41:01,900
It was consumed by the fire.
I can't believe I missed it.

658
00:41:01,902 --> 00:41:03,169
Okay.

659
00:41:03,171 --> 00:41:04,738
Let's go.

660
00:41:08,043 --> 00:41:09,843
[echoing] <i>Sean.</i>

661
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:13,148
<i>Sean.</i>

662
00:41:14,915 --> 00:41:17,150
[Sean]
<i>Ghosts with fire-like eyes.</i>

663
00:41:17,152 --> 00:41:19,685
Sean!

664
00:41:19,687 --> 00:41:21,056
<i>They're me.</i>

665
00:41:22,123 --> 00:41:25,825
- <i>I'm them.</i>
- [echoing] <i>Sean!</i>

666
00:41:25,827 --> 00:41:26,993
<i>Sean.</i>

667
00:41:26,995 --> 00:41:30,063
[dog barking]

668
00:41:30,065 --> 00:41:34,100
Dodged Animal Control
one more night, huh?

669
00:41:34,102 --> 00:41:36,269
What are you doin', huh?

670
00:41:36,271 --> 00:41:37,939
[barks]

671
00:41:40,108 --> 00:41:42,677
- Really?
- [dog whimpers]

672
00:41:47,215 --> 00:41:49,017
[dog barking]

673
00:42:01,563 --> 00:42:04,964
So, you start
in the air-con unit,

674
00:42:04,966 --> 00:42:07,969
slow, findin' your rhythm.

675
00:42:09,804 --> 00:42:11,840
Then you're led
through the ducts.

676
00:42:13,775 --> 00:42:17,079
You're hungry.
You know it's bait, but you bite.

677
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,718
BZ, second cellulose igniter kept you
travelin' through the ducts at speed.

678
00:42:26,222 --> 00:42:29,025
But you never managed
a gulp of air.

679
00:42:31,861 --> 00:42:35,095
A house this old, this loose?

680
00:42:35,097 --> 00:42:37,831
You should've gotten
around a window,

681
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:40,870
a chink in the wall,
found more oxygen and kept goin'.

682
00:42:43,139 --> 00:42:45,005
Something trapped you.

683
00:42:45,007 --> 00:42:46,874
[voice]
<i>Made you lose your mind.</i>

684
00:42:46,876 --> 00:42:49,745
Strangled you,
made you lose your mind.

685
00:42:52,114 --> 00:42:55,117
Left you lyin' here
silently for hours...

686
00:42:56,986 --> 00:43:00,020
a thousand degrees,
all dressed up, nowhere to go.

687
00:43:00,022 --> 00:43:01,822
[voice] <i>Nowhere to go.</i>

688
00:43:01,824 --> 00:43:03,893
[dog whimpering]

689
00:43:06,829 --> 00:43:09,197
What you got? Huh?

690
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:12,835
What you got?
You smellin' something strange?

691
00:43:18,041 --> 00:43:21,042
That's how they trapped you.

692
00:43:21,044 --> 00:43:24,915
They sealed off the air and turned
the whole room into a frustration box.

693
00:43:26,316 --> 00:43:30,151
You always do off-duty investigations
in the middle of the night?

694
00:43:30,153 --> 00:43:32,821
It's the way I work.
What's your excuse?

695
00:43:32,823 --> 00:43:34,255
Oh, you have a dog?

696
00:43:34,257 --> 00:43:38,126
A stray.
A stray with skills, apparently.

697
00:43:38,128 --> 00:43:39,394
The stray have a name?

698
00:43:39,396 --> 00:43:42,831
Well, if he had a name,
he'd be mine.

699
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:45,333
You know,
I kept checkin' on you.

700
00:43:45,335 --> 00:43:48,203
Nobody likes to talk about it
though, right?

701
00:43:48,205 --> 00:43:52,173
Big hero, saving a kid
not once but twice

702
00:43:52,175 --> 00:43:54,911
before you even had three years on?
[scoffs]

703
00:43:56,279 --> 00:43:59,315
I mean,
articles in <i>The Tribune,</i> awards.

704
00:43:59,317 --> 00:44:01,985
Face of the new department.

705
00:44:02,986 --> 00:44:06,154
But if you sniff hard enough,
and I did,

706
00:44:06,156 --> 00:44:09,092
it turns out there's this
whole other story, right?

707
00:44:10,128 --> 00:44:12,361
This firefighter
who starts stealin' things

708
00:44:12,363 --> 00:44:14,296
from the apartments
she's been fightin' fires in.

709
00:44:14,298 --> 00:44:16,198
I mean, come on, man.
What is that?

710
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,237
That's like bein' a fuckin'
child molester on this job.

711
00:44:20,972 --> 00:44:23,239
What was it? Hmm?

712
00:44:23,241 --> 00:44:25,241
All that attention,

713
00:44:25,243 --> 00:44:28,179
all those expectations make you wanna
do bad things and hurt yourself?

714
00:44:29,447 --> 00:44:32,948
You know what? You got just enough
juice from all those awards,

715
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:37,319
they give you one last shot and move
you away from Suppression and into OFI,

716
00:44:37,321 --> 00:44:39,121
because we don't
do charity here, right?

717
00:44:39,123 --> 00:44:40,489
You don't know me.

718
00:44:40,491 --> 00:44:42,391
Oh, but I think I can guess.

719
00:44:42,393 --> 00:44:46,495
Yeah? Maybe you know all about
the, uh, pressure of rumors.

720
00:44:46,497 --> 00:44:48,166
Ah.

721
00:44:59,243 --> 00:45:01,243
Plumber's putty.

722
00:45:01,245 --> 00:45:03,513
They sealed off the air
exchange points with it.

723
00:45:03,515 --> 00:45:05,181
Burns clean under the heat.

724
00:45:05,183 --> 00:45:07,517
I would've missed it
if it weren't for that mutt.

725
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:10,487
So they wanted the house
interior to burn completely.

726
00:45:10,489 --> 00:45:12,157
Yeah.

727
00:45:14,992 --> 00:45:17,962
I got nowhere else
to go, okay?

728
00:45:19,331 --> 00:45:20,997
Nowhere.

729
00:45:20,999 --> 00:45:24,000
And what do you want me
to do about it?

730
00:45:24,002 --> 00:45:25,437
I can be good at this.

731
00:45:26,305 --> 00:45:28,373
Okay. All right.

732
00:45:29,308 --> 00:45:32,244
What does all this
say to you? Hmm?

733
00:45:34,479 --> 00:45:39,015
That it's a hell of a lot of trouble just
to go after a couple that wasn't even home.

734
00:45:39,017 --> 00:45:41,987
Yeah, you see I don't think
it was ever about the owners.

735
00:45:43,121 --> 00:45:45,924
I think it was
about the house itself.

736
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:51,029
Somebody didn't need it
burned, they needed it erased.

737
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:54,967
Now, why don't you go home
and think about that?

738
00:45:57,035 --> 00:45:58,937
I'll see ya tomorrow.

739
00:46:07,179 --> 00:46:09,547
So you got anything
on the Hunters or not?

740
00:46:09,549 --> 00:46:12,082
Like I e-mailed
your partner here,

741
00:46:12,084 --> 00:46:15,586
some chaotic finances, mainly to do
with their tech company, Hunter Systems.

742
00:46:15,588 --> 00:46:18,522
What does, uh,
Hunter Systems make?

743
00:46:18,524 --> 00:46:22,395
A subcontractor
in some kind of, uh, NATO...

744
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:25,162
Where the hell is it?

745
00:46:25,164 --> 00:46:28,366
NATO AIM-120 missile upgrade.

746
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:32,536
There have been quality control
issues over DOD quality specs.

747
00:46:32,538 --> 00:46:34,372
Hunters have been
shifting money around,

748
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:37,308
trying to keep the company going
until they can sort it out.

749
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:39,143
They're in trouble,
they're not.

750
00:46:39,145 --> 00:46:43,116
The DOD, the DA and the feds
can't seem make up their minds.

751
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:53,391
We've been over this with the police
and our project supervisors at DOD.

752
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:57,862
Nobody's seen or heard from Jan and Rod
Hunter since the fire at their townhouse.

753
00:46:57,864 --> 00:47:00,865
Did Rodger Hunter normally spend
a lot of time at the office?

754
00:47:00,867 --> 00:47:03,301
Depended on where we were
in development.

755
00:47:03,303 --> 00:47:04,603
It's his company.

756
00:47:04,605 --> 00:47:07,372
Were they havin' problems
with production?

757
00:47:07,374 --> 00:47:09,541
I can't get into specifics,

758
00:47:09,543 --> 00:47:13,545
but there were redesign requests on
the missile's seeker head optics.

759
00:47:13,547 --> 00:47:16,415
That's the part of
the AIM-120 we do.

760
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,883
And then there was the fire,
of course.

761
00:47:18,885 --> 00:47:20,321
Fire?

762
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:24,523
On our test bed.

763
00:47:24,525 --> 00:47:26,158
[beeps]

764
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,427
The techs were doing
our first integrated run

765
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:32,331
on a fully functional prototype
of the new AIM Rathyeon sent over.

766
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:35,233
Unfortunately, a fire
broke out after-hours,

767
00:47:35,235 --> 00:47:37,436
and the prototype
was destroyed.

768
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:41,473
It's caused a delay
and slowed our cash flow.

769
00:47:41,475 --> 00:47:43,241
Were you insured?

770
00:47:43,243 --> 00:47:47,346
Of course. The fire was
determined accidental.

771
00:47:47,348 --> 00:47:52,284
Our insurance company though,
have been slow in our payments.

772
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:55,253
- Why?
- They're an insurance company.

773
00:47:55,255 --> 00:47:57,189
Who investigated
the fire?

774
00:47:57,191 --> 00:48:00,460
We're in a small suburb here
with a volunteer fire department.

775
00:48:00,462 --> 00:48:02,462
They don't have
an arson office.

776
00:48:02,464 --> 00:48:06,532
Since we're on a fed contract
they sent someone over from ATF.

777
00:48:06,534 --> 00:48:08,403
ATF guy
have a name?

778
00:48:09,704 --> 00:48:11,704
Ralph Kunz.

779
00:48:11,706 --> 00:48:14,476
I think we're gonna need to
have a look at that fire scene.

780
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:24,384
Banged itself inside

781
00:48:24,386 --> 00:48:26,619
lookin' for a breath of air just
like the Hunter's townhouse.

782
00:48:26,621 --> 00:48:28,621
Can I use the word?

783
00:48:28,623 --> 00:48:30,325
Backdraft?

784
00:48:31,226 --> 00:48:32,660
Guess we just did.

785
00:48:36,398 --> 00:48:39,232
Show me where the investigator
tagged the origin of the fire?

786
00:48:39,234 --> 00:48:40,635
Over there.

787
00:48:42,637 --> 00:48:44,237
What is it?

788
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:47,173
A cooling plant.

789
00:48:47,175 --> 00:48:49,710
Rocket was unarmed,
of course.

790
00:48:49,712 --> 00:48:52,512
The solid fuel
went off in the heat.

791
00:48:52,514 --> 00:48:55,116
There was basically
nothing left after.

792
00:49:08,397 --> 00:49:10,296
Why do I think
if we scrape this,

793
00:49:10,298 --> 00:49:13,534
we're gonna find traces
of BZ and linoleum?

794
00:49:13,536 --> 00:49:16,737
Kinda convenient the building
happens to go off

795
00:49:16,739 --> 00:49:19,406
when they have
a missile prototype in there.

796
00:49:19,408 --> 00:49:21,275
Why burn their own building?

797
00:49:21,277 --> 00:49:22,676
Well,
if the Department of Defense

798
00:49:22,678 --> 00:49:25,379
were havin'
quality control issues,

799
00:49:25,381 --> 00:49:27,714
it could slow down
an investigation.

800
00:49:27,716 --> 00:49:29,716
Insurance money
would help hold 'em over.

801
00:49:29,718 --> 00:49:33,220
Only the insurance company
is slowly walkin' a payment.

802
00:49:33,222 --> 00:49:37,359
It's probably because they're as suspicious
of Kunz's "accidental" call as we are.

803
00:49:46,469 --> 00:49:48,637
[siren chirping]

804
00:49:52,575 --> 00:49:54,241
- McCaffrey.
- <i>Doyle.</i>

805
00:49:54,243 --> 00:49:58,680
<i>Auto fire you might be interested
in, in a lot right now off Kensey.</i>

806
00:49:58,682 --> 00:50:01,484
- <i>Just saying.</i>
- Copy that. We're on our way.

807
00:50:06,656 --> 00:50:09,323
- That the Hunters?
- It's their car.

808
00:50:09,325 --> 00:50:11,392
Gonna take dental or DNA
to confirm their ID,

809
00:50:11,394 --> 00:50:13,361
but I'm takin' bets on yes.

810
00:50:13,363 --> 00:50:16,831
Probably lured here to meet
someone, or they were dumped.

811
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:19,634
Passing uniforms came
on it already burning.

812
00:50:19,636 --> 00:50:22,205
- If it burns, it's yours.
- Yeah.

813
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,574
Easy.
It's still a crime scene.

814
00:50:26,576 --> 00:50:28,743
Jesus, Kunz,
you're like a bad penny.

815
00:50:28,745 --> 00:50:31,646
You wanna tell me what you're doin'
nosin' around a car fire in my city?

816
00:50:31,648 --> 00:50:36,319
Talk to the badge.
The gold federal one over there.

817
00:50:44,394 --> 00:50:45,493
McCaffrey.

818
00:50:45,495 --> 00:50:47,230
Agent Johnson.

819
00:50:48,632 --> 00:50:52,100
Is there someplace around here
we could get something to eat?

820
00:50:52,102 --> 00:50:57,338
You know Hunter Systems was on the bankruptcy
bubble with this missile subcontract.

821
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:00,542
Rod Hunter was grabbing money anywhere
he could to keep the doors open.

822
00:51:00,544 --> 00:51:03,478
Hang on. So you're thinkin' insurance
fraud on the fire that burned the missile?

823
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,581
Oh, I'm pretty sure
Hunter had somebody light it,

824
00:51:05,583 --> 00:51:07,716
regardless what
the ATF comes up with,

825
00:51:07,718 --> 00:51:10,419
but not for the insurance.

826
00:51:10,421 --> 00:51:13,822
The AIM-120 missile
was a big deal.

827
00:51:13,824 --> 00:51:18,661
Next-gen seeker heads could take
out any peer air force fighter.

828
00:51:18,663 --> 00:51:20,563
Thank you.

829
00:51:20,565 --> 00:51:24,333
A lot of alarm bells went off
in the Pentagon after the fire.

830
00:51:24,335 --> 00:51:26,335
DOD inspectors
swarmed the place,

831
00:51:26,337 --> 00:51:28,671
did a thorough on the
missile parts that survived.

832
00:51:28,673 --> 00:51:32,641
There wasn't much, but enough to spot
that what had burned in that test bed

833
00:51:32,643 --> 00:51:36,380
was a mock-up substituted
for the real prototype.

834
00:51:41,619 --> 00:51:43,485
Then cue the wife.

835
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:46,355
Soon as she realizes
DOD isn't buyin' the switch,

836
00:51:46,357 --> 00:51:48,825
she walks into my office
and cops to the whole thing.

837
00:51:48,827 --> 00:51:51,493
How her husband
planned to shop the real one,

838
00:51:51,495 --> 00:51:53,830
with all its spooky
next generation technology,

839
00:51:53,832 --> 00:51:55,832
to certain unsavory middlemen

840
00:51:55,834 --> 00:51:58,835
who would then market its specs
to any unpleasant foreign entities

841
00:51:58,837 --> 00:52:00,870
willing to pay
plenty for them.

842
00:52:00,872 --> 00:52:03,940
Wait, hang on. So, uh, Hunter handed
over the missile to these middlemen?

843
00:52:03,942 --> 00:52:05,542
That's the thing.

844
00:52:05,544 --> 00:52:06,876
Turns out the wife
moved it someplace else

845
00:52:06,878 --> 00:52:08,545
without telling her husband,

846
00:52:08,547 --> 00:52:10,580
or that she'd come to us
for a deal.

847
00:52:10,582 --> 00:52:12,414
She promised us
all the evidence,

848
00:52:12,416 --> 00:52:13,917
and the missile's location
on a hard drive,

849
00:52:13,919 --> 00:52:15,518
in exchange
for immunity.

850
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,886
And then
they disappeared.

851
00:52:16,888 --> 00:52:20,824
So, our unsavory middlemen
probably paid Rod,

852
00:52:20,826 --> 00:52:25,428
and when he couldn't deliver the
prototype 'cause wifey moved it...

853
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:28,531
Well, I'm imagining they worked them over
pretty good before lighting up that car.

854
00:52:28,533 --> 00:52:31,468
- Yeah, right.
- Which I'm guessing also means

855
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:33,470
she probably told them
where the missile really was.

856
00:52:33,472 --> 00:52:35,872
But, given their bodies
were only dumped today,

857
00:52:35,874 --> 00:52:38,408
they may have been
on the run till now,

858
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:41,711
which means it's possible our bad guys
haven't yet been able to move the prototype.

859
00:52:41,713 --> 00:52:43,914
With something that big,
you can't just put it in checked luggage.

860
00:52:43,916 --> 00:52:47,550
They're gonna have to move it through
a shipping port to a third country.

861
00:52:47,552 --> 00:52:50,754
And we've got devices that can sniff
out hydroxyl polybutadiene propellant

862
00:52:50,756 --> 00:52:52,589
deployed at all
likely exit points.

863
00:52:52,591 --> 00:52:54,825
Hang on. There's no way
they found the hard drive.

864
00:52:54,827 --> 00:52:56,693
That's why
they used a backdraft.

865
00:52:56,695 --> 00:52:59,429
Okay, look, backdraft cooks
for hours before it blows,

866
00:52:59,431 --> 00:53:01,732
thoroughly incinerates
any evidence inside.

867
00:53:01,734 --> 00:53:03,834
They had to be sure.

868
00:53:03,836 --> 00:53:06,671
It's possible they killed her before
she said anything about working with us.

869
00:53:06,673 --> 00:53:09,907
If so, we want
their guard down enough,

870
00:53:09,909 --> 00:53:12,543
we can catch them when
they try to move the prototype.

871
00:53:12,545 --> 00:53:14,244
Five kids
died in that fire.

872
00:53:14,246 --> 00:53:16,514
I wanna catch the assholes
that did it.

873
00:53:16,516 --> 00:53:18,849
Not declaring it arson, at least not
yet, will help me do that.

874

Oh, and I suppose
it not being arson

from havin' to publicly explain

876
00:53:23,923 --> 00:53:28,726
that they let slip a top secret missile to our
country's enemies has got nothin' to do with it?

877
00:53:28,728 --> 00:53:30,895
Come on.
Accidental fire, I imagine,

878
00:53:30,897 --> 00:53:33,264
makes a whole lot of
conversations go away, right?

or their missile,

to cover their tracks...

887
00:54:06,033 --> 00:54:07,901
they made a big mistake.

894

Eric made fast friends
with my son.

Were you ever at the house?

900
00:55:09,063 --> 00:55:11,998
We buried our dinosaurs there,

901
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,701
but Mrs. Hunter got really,
really mad at us.

902
00:55:15,703 --> 00:55:18,638
So, she said that
if we wanted to dig,

903
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,707
we had to go
play in the park.

904
00:55:21,709 --> 00:55:24,846

to keep a lid on it for now.

1027
01:02:48,497 --> 01:02:51,097
I was thinkin'
we'd have a little chat.

1028
01:02:51,099 --> 01:02:54,068
Jesus Christ, you're insane.
Would you just get me out of here?

1029
01:02:55,371 --> 01:02:58,104
Think we got all night,
unless you're bleeding internally,

1030
01:02:58,106 --> 01:03:01,243
or, uh,
this wall comes down on you.

1031
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:05,579
My God,
this family's so fucked up.

1032
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:08,215
Okay, Uncle,
what's on your mind?

1033
01:03:08,217 --> 01:03:11,218
How much longer you gonna keep
blamin' me for Stephen's death?

1034
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,989
Well, we got all night, right?

1035
01:03:15,491 --> 01:03:18,125
You weren't there
that night, Sean.

1036
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:19,593
You don't know what happened.

1037
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:22,529
I know as soon as you could,
you moved out of Suppression,

1038
01:03:22,531 --> 01:03:24,631
because you don't have it
in the belly.

1039
01:03:24,633 --> 01:03:28,068
Not like your brother,
or your father.

1040
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:29,202
Or you?

1041
01:03:29,204 --> 01:03:31,405
Hey, fuck you.
I would've beat it.

1042
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:34,341
Or you might've wound up dead like
everybody else in this goddamn family.

1043
01:03:34,343 --> 01:03:37,144
Why don't you just tell me
what happened?

1044
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:40,115
Because, Sean, there are
things about that day that...

1045
01:03:42,284 --> 01:03:43,586
nobody's supposed to know.

1046
01:03:45,422 --> 01:03:48,155
Sean, you gotta trust me.

1047
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:52,393
There's nothing I could've done.
Nothing, about that day.

1048
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:54,662
Bullshit! Bullshit!

1049
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:57,432
You were there!
You could've saved him.

1050
01:03:57,434 --> 01:04:00,901
Don't you understand?
I need to know what happened.

1051
01:04:00,903 --> 01:04:03,340
Brian, I always have.

1052
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:07,077
Sean.

1053
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:13,183
Your father died
tryin' to save his best friend.

1054
01:04:21,925 --> 01:04:25,328
But his best friend
was an arsonist.

1055
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:29,432
Adcox was an arsonist.

1056
01:04:41,444 --> 01:04:42,446
Sean...

1057
01:04:44,615 --> 01:04:48,249
if there's one thing
I've learned is that there's...

1058
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:51,185
more to life than hangin' onto
this family bullshit,

1059
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:54,458
this dysfunction over
and over and over, this...

1060
01:04:55,659 --> 01:04:57,191
Come on.

1061
01:04:57,193 --> 01:04:59,661
I just, I hope you can...

1062
01:04:59,663 --> 01:05:02,533
you can find a way
to move forward from this, man.

1063
01:05:04,602 --> 01:05:07,104
Before it's fuckin' too late.

1064
01:05:10,474 --> 01:05:12,641
[creaking]

1065
01:05:12,643 --> 01:05:15,479
Sounds like that wall's
about to come down.

1066
01:05:19,683 --> 01:05:21,385
[Brian] It sure is.

1067
01:05:23,454 --> 01:05:26,722
Not that we care though, right?

1068
01:05:26,724 --> 01:05:32,530
As, you know, McCaffreys?
[chuckles]

1069
01:05:37,268 --> 01:05:38,701
[chuckling]

1070
01:05:38,703 --> 01:05:40,438
[laughs]

1071
01:05:46,445 --> 01:05:48,312
Let's get you outta here.

1072
01:05:50,682 --> 01:05:52,551
Hey, 17!

1073
01:05:53,685 --> 01:05:56,686
I got him, 17!

1074
01:05:56,688 --> 01:05:58,490
[echoing] I got him!

1075
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:10,535
[no audible dialogue]

1076
01:06:19,311 --> 01:06:21,446
[muffled]

1077
01:06:56,649 --> 01:06:59,217
[liquid pouring]

1078
01:07:02,788 --> 01:07:05,525
Son of a bitch up there.

1079
01:07:06,492 --> 01:07:08,492
No confession.

1080
01:07:08,494 --> 01:07:10,696
No evidence.
Not even a fuckin' name.

1081
01:07:11,731 --> 01:07:14,331
[scoffs]
You're amazing.

1082
01:07:14,333 --> 01:07:15,635
What?

1083
01:07:16,702 --> 01:07:19,539
You just
walked through fire,

1084
01:07:20,773 --> 01:07:24,642
saved a kid, swan dived,
what, three stories?

1085
01:07:24,644 --> 01:07:25,645
And walked away.

1086
01:07:26,812 --> 01:07:28,646
That's the best
this job ever gets.

1087
01:07:28,648 --> 01:07:30,616
Trust me,
I know.

1088
01:07:31,617 --> 01:07:33,584
You know,
when I had those two saves...

1089
01:07:33,586 --> 01:07:36,554
[sighs]

1090
01:07:36,556 --> 01:07:38,659
nothing
could touch me, man.

1091
01:07:40,393 --> 01:07:42,663
Until it did.

1092
01:07:44,463 --> 01:07:46,299
That was later.

1093
01:07:47,501 --> 01:07:49,670
But in the moment...

1094
01:07:51,304 --> 01:07:52,704
when it belonged
to just me,

1095
01:07:52,706 --> 01:07:56,441
I howled at the moon at the
sheer awesomeness of it.

1096
01:07:56,443 --> 01:07:58,443
Yeah.

1097
01:07:58,445 --> 01:08:01,513
You? You're sittin' around
drinkin', thinkin' about arson.

1098
01:08:01,515 --> 01:08:03,815
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- What's wrong with me?

1099
01:08:03,817 --> 01:08:06,618
I'll tell you what's wrong with me.
I suck at bein' a fireman.

1100
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:10,388
- [scoffs]
- I suck at the camaraderie and the storytelling and the whole,

1101
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:13,860
"We-happy-few,
let's-go-wrestle-old-man-fire" bullshit.

1102
01:08:16,496 --> 01:08:19,764
I'll never have my grandfather's
sense of duty,

1103
01:08:19,766 --> 01:08:24,771
or my father's charisma, or my uncle's
weird, fucked-up sense of perspective.

1104
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,673
I'll always blow just about
everything to do with this job,

1105
01:08:28,675 --> 01:08:30,709
except for one part,

1106
01:08:30,711 --> 01:08:32,613
and that's beatin' fire.

1107
01:08:34,448 --> 01:08:37,817
I mean, I don't cry enough
about what I see.

1108
01:08:37,819 --> 01:08:39,919
I don't know anybody's name.

1109
01:08:39,921 --> 01:08:43,723
I don't give a fuck about 99 percent
of the people wastin' oxygen around me,

1110
01:08:43,725 --> 01:08:48,529
but nobody... nobody puts
away more arsonists than I do.

1111
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:53,633
You know, maybe all that
makes me a bad fireman,

1112
01:08:53,635 --> 01:08:56,669
or maybe, just maybe,

1113
01:08:56,671 --> 01:08:58,806
it makes me the best one here.

1114
01:09:02,477 --> 01:09:04,779
You know, I really don't
give a shit which one it is.

1115
01:09:07,615 --> 01:09:11,619
To two firefighters
who suck at bein' firefighters.

1116
01:09:16,457 --> 01:09:17,625
[sighs]

1117
01:09:22,563 --> 01:09:26,367
[birds tweeting in distance]

1118
01:09:41,917 --> 01:09:43,618
Hey, Mom.

1119
01:09:56,031 --> 01:09:57,431
I'm okay.

1120
01:09:57,433 --> 01:09:59,966
[car horns honking]

1121
01:09:59,968 --> 01:10:01,837
[door slamming]

1122
01:10:09,912 --> 01:10:12,446
All his visitors,
last 12 months.

1123
01:10:12,448 --> 01:10:13,682
Okay.

1124
01:10:20,956 --> 01:10:22,756
- So who are you?
- [knocking]

1125
01:10:22,758 --> 01:10:26,462
[Ronald]
Do I hear a McCaffrey out there?

1126
01:10:27,796 --> 01:10:29,830
Where are you going, Sean?

1127
01:10:29,832 --> 01:10:33,533
You going back
to West Haddon Street?

1128
01:10:33,535 --> 01:10:35,535
Sean?

1129
01:10:35,537 --> 01:10:37,239
- Sean!
- [door buzzing]

1130
01:10:38,707 --> 01:10:41,743
[horn blaring]

1131
01:10:41,745 --> 01:10:43,579
[Ronald]
<i>Sean!</i>

1132
01:10:44,714 --> 01:10:45,949
[echoing] <i>Sean.</i>

1133
01:10:47,549 --> 01:10:49,451
<i>Sean!</i>

1134
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:52,689
<i>Sean?</i>

1135
01:10:54,924 --> 01:10:57,725
What? Were all
the bowling alleys closed?

1136
01:10:57,727 --> 01:11:02,563
Department's tryin' to declare
the Hunter fire "Undetermined."

1137
01:11:02,565 --> 01:11:04,732
- You kidding me?
- If the evidence isn't there...

1138
01:11:04,734 --> 01:11:06,801
Hey, I wasn't talkin' to you.

1139
01:11:06,803 --> 01:11:09,771
Listen, I'm investigator of record here.
I'm not gonna sign off on that.

1140
01:11:09,773 --> 01:11:12,640
You're not the lead
on the case anymore, Sean.

1141
01:11:12,642 --> 01:11:14,575
But you can't do that,
not without cause.

1142
01:11:14,577 --> 01:11:16,479
That spark
you dangled out the window,

1143
01:11:17,347 --> 01:11:18,746
he filed
a battery complaint.

1144
01:11:18,748 --> 01:11:21,083
- Fuckin' Christ, this is bullshit!
- Yeah?

1145
01:11:21,085 --> 01:11:23,885
Plus they got witnesses that overheard
Rening yellin' at you about it.

1146
01:11:23,887 --> 01:11:26,754
- That wasn't... Look, I didn't mean...
- The guy's a fuckin' arsonist.

1147
01:11:26,756 --> 01:11:29,624
He lit the building that burned him.
But whatever, okay?

1148
01:11:29,626 --> 01:11:31,692
Let him file.
I'll beat it with my eyes closed.

1149
01:11:31,694 --> 01:11:34,529
- Just don't take me off my burn.
- Already done.

1150
01:11:34,531 --> 01:11:36,932
- Kunz.
- I swear to fuckin' God.

1151
01:11:36,934 --> 01:11:40,035
Soto wants more liaison
between OFI and ATF anyway,

1152
01:11:40,037 --> 01:11:42,037
so he's gonna let them
run with it for now.

1153
01:11:42,039 --> 01:11:45,542
- With this asshole?
- Two guys walk in, one walks out.

1154
01:11:46,811 --> 01:11:49,847
I'm not happy about it either, okay?
At all.

1155
01:11:51,148 --> 01:11:53,381
But, for now,
it's done.

1156
01:11:53,383 --> 01:11:56,652
You're on admin leave until they make
a determination on the battery...

1157
01:11:56,654 --> 01:11:57,922
Damn it!

1158
01:11:58,823 --> 01:12:00,122
Fucking everybody!

1159
01:12:00,124 --> 01:12:02,891
Everybody from Chief Soto
to the FBI

1160
01:12:02,893 --> 01:12:06,762
to the whole goddamn world wants
this to be anything but arson.

1161
01:12:06,764 --> 01:12:09,731
Everybody but the mothers
of those children.

1162
01:12:09,733 --> 01:12:13,068
[sighs] Come on, Brian.
Don't do this. I am so close.

1163
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:15,904
Maybe if you bit your tongue
every once in a while,

1164
01:12:15,906 --> 01:12:19,043
your career dissipation light
wouldn't be flashin' right now.

1165
01:12:20,678 --> 01:12:22,145
The trouble with
bitin' my tongue is

1166
01:12:22,147 --> 01:12:24,815
I always seem to end up
with a mouthful of blood.

1167
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:27,718
Take some time, Sean.

1168
01:12:28,153 --> 01:12:30,088
- Cool off.
- Whatever.

1169
01:12:33,724 --> 01:12:35,060
Fucker!

1170
01:12:41,833 --> 01:12:43,902
[line ringing]

1171
01:12:49,741 --> 01:12:52,008
[woman on phone]
<i>Hey. Is everything okay?</i>

1172
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:54,110
[Sean on phone] <i>Hey.</i>

1173
01:12:54,112 --> 01:12:57,048
<i>Can we just stay in tonight?
I need to see you.</i>

1174
01:13:01,953 --> 01:13:05,590
- [dog panting]
- Can they really do that?

1175
01:13:07,092 --> 01:13:09,895
- Guess they just did.
- [dog whimpering]

1176
01:13:13,198 --> 01:13:16,733
Did you ever crack
what those numbers were?

1177
01:13:16,735 --> 01:13:18,801
Nope.
Just a part of it,

1178
01:13:18,803 --> 01:13:20,237
a bunch of locations
across the city,

1179
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:22,874
but we don't even know
how they connect.

1180
01:13:26,478 --> 01:13:28,880
Did anyone suggest
cell tower loggings?

1181
01:13:30,482 --> 01:13:32,016
What do you mean?

1182
01:13:32,018 --> 01:13:35,752
Just something I saw
on oil projects in Saudi.

1183
01:13:35,754 --> 01:13:37,154
Rather than guard
every project,

1184
01:13:37,156 --> 01:13:40,057
they would put trackers
on the machinery.

1185
01:13:40,059 --> 01:13:42,026
Hang on, what?

1186
01:13:42,028 --> 01:13:45,963
They had built-in accelerometers
that activated when it was moved.

1187
01:13:45,965 --> 01:13:49,769
When it got in range of a cell
tower, it would start phoning home.

1188
01:13:50,937 --> 01:13:52,838
This looks at lot
like the same thing.

1189
01:13:54,206 --> 01:13:57,775
Did the Hunters put a cell-based
tracker on the crate you're looking for?

1190
01:13:57,777 --> 01:14:00,445
Uh, I don't know.
The wife might've done.

1191
01:14:01,814 --> 01:14:05,082
Hey. Listen, can you, uh,
check with a cell phone company,

1192
01:14:05,084 --> 01:14:08,986
see if any of those numbers
you sent me match towers.

1193
01:14:08,988 --> 01:14:12,189
Yeah, all right,
call me back.

1194
01:14:12,191 --> 01:14:14,024
Are they gonna run it down?

1195
01:14:14,026 --> 01:14:16,126
Hopefully.
I'm not allowed near it for now.

1196
01:14:16,128 --> 01:14:18,731
But Christ, Jenny,
that's amazing.

1197
01:14:19,932 --> 01:14:22,132
- [kisses]
- [dog yelps]

1198
01:14:22,134 --> 01:14:23,734
Have you
named him yet?

1199
01:14:23,736 --> 01:14:25,938
Well, if he had a name,
he'd be mine.

1200
01:14:27,807 --> 01:14:29,475
- [beeping]
- [object clicks]

1201
01:14:31,877 --> 01:14:33,713
[dog whimpering]

1202
01:14:40,253 --> 01:14:42,222
[whining]

1203
01:14:45,092 --> 01:14:46,860
What is it?

1204
01:14:49,229 --> 01:14:50,864
[whimpers]

1205
01:14:52,232 --> 01:14:54,966
Hey. Hey, wake up.

1206
01:14:54,968 --> 01:14:56,502
- [groans]
- Wake up.

1207
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:05,078
Oh, shit.

1208
01:15:09,850 --> 01:15:11,316
[groans]

1209
01:15:11,318 --> 01:15:14,353
Hey, Jenny. Jenny, wake up.

1210
01:15:14,355 --> 01:15:16,988
Mm. What?

1211
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:18,957
- Hey, wake up.
- What's going on? What's that smell?

1212
01:15:18,959 --> 01:15:20,992
- Hey! Don't move.
- What?

1213
01:15:20,994 --> 01:15:22,929
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

1214
01:15:24,097 --> 01:15:26,998
That's gas. It's comin' up
through the floorboards.

1215
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,001
Look at me.
I'm not fuckin' around, okay?

1216
01:15:30,003 --> 01:15:32,338
There's a contact switch
under the bed that's just set.

1217
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:34,606
- If we get up, it's gonna blow...
- Blow?

1218
01:15:34,608 --> 01:15:37,176
- [clicks]
- Easy. Listen to me.

1219
01:15:37,178 --> 01:15:39,778
Now, I can keep
my weight on it, okay?

1220
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:43,149
And you can ease out,
but take it slow.

1221
01:15:43,151 --> 01:15:44,816
Okay?

1222
01:15:44,818 --> 01:15:47,889
You can do it. Slow. Go on.

1223
01:15:48,923 --> 01:15:50,291
Go on.

1224
01:15:51,893 --> 01:15:54,026
Easy, easy,
easy, easy, easy!

1225
01:15:54,028 --> 01:15:55,995
Let me get over.

1226
01:15:55,997 --> 01:15:57,098
There you go.

1227
01:15:57,899 --> 01:15:59,000
Easy.

1228
01:16:00,301 --> 01:16:02,134
Okay, stop, stop, stop.

1229
01:16:02,136 --> 01:16:03,938
All right.
All right, come on.

1230
01:16:08,276 --> 01:16:11,310
- Okay, now get outta here and call the fire station.
- What, just leave you here?

1231
01:16:11,312 --> 01:16:13,279
- Jenny, listen to me.
- I-I can't.

1232
01:16:13,281 --> 01:16:15,147
Listen to me!

1233
01:16:15,149 --> 01:16:17,917
The sooner you make that call,
the better chance I have, okay?

1234
01:16:17,919 --> 01:16:19,587
Go! Come on!

1235
01:16:20,288 --> 01:16:24,092
Goddamn it. Fuck.

1236
01:16:27,128 --> 01:16:29,597
You could've warned me earlier.

1237
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:32,232
Don't look at me like that.

1238
01:16:32,234 --> 01:16:34,367
Odds would've been better at the
pound, pal. Just sayin'.

1239
01:16:34,369 --> 01:16:37,306
[sirens wailing]

1240
01:16:44,679 --> 01:16:46,848
- He's in the bedroom.
- Stay out here.

1241
01:16:53,055 --> 01:16:54,857
Oh shit, Sean.

1242
01:16:55,290 --> 01:16:57,390
Engine 36 is on the way.

1243
01:16:57,392 --> 01:16:59,459
- What, Hector?
- Second shift. Masey.

1244
01:16:59,461 --> 01:17:01,361
- Okay.
- Oh, shit.

1245
01:17:01,363 --> 01:17:03,230
They got you all
rigged up down here.

1246
01:17:03,232 --> 01:17:06,099
[sniffs]
Is that gas?

1247
01:17:06,101 --> 01:17:08,168
Yeah, they probably tricked it
from the stove line

1248
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:12,005
into a shaped pocket to blow
upwards when it's released.

1249
01:17:12,007 --> 01:17:15,142
- What do I do?
- I try not to think about what you're gonna do.

1250
01:17:15,144 --> 01:17:17,344
Hey! No, wait.
Where are you goin'?

1251
01:17:17,346 --> 01:17:19,913
- I'm gonna try and cut it off at the main.
- No. Don't.

1252
01:17:19,915 --> 01:17:23,016
They probably booby-trapped it in case I
smelled the gas before the plate timer set.

1253
01:17:23,018 --> 01:17:25,185
Listen, if Masey knows
what he's doing,

1254
01:17:25,187 --> 01:17:27,888
he can use his shoring blocks
to slowly replace my weight

1255
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:29,390
and get me off it
before the plate timer...

1256
01:17:29,392 --> 01:17:31,725
- [clicking]
- Oh, shit!

1257
01:17:31,727 --> 01:17:33,361
- What'd you do?
- I don't know.

1258
01:17:33,363 --> 01:17:35,729
Maybe-Maybe there's a secondary timer.
I'm not sure.

1259
01:17:35,731 --> 01:17:38,232
I'm gonna shut it off
down here.

1260
01:17:38,234 --> 01:17:39,500
Brian, get out!

1261
01:17:39,502 --> 01:17:41,435
Brian, just get out
of the building!

1262
01:17:41,437 --> 01:17:44,238
Just do me a favor.
Shut up and don't move.

1263
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:48,075
No, Brian,
don't be stupid. Get out!

1264
01:17:48,077 --> 01:17:50,011
I'm gonna draw the gas
down here away from you.

1265
01:17:50,013 --> 01:17:51,312
No! Brian, get out the building!

1266
01:17:51,314 --> 01:17:53,514
I'm not letting
another McCaffrey die.

1267
01:17:53,516 --> 01:17:56,083
Listen to me. You'll watch two
if you don't get out now!

1268
01:17:56,085 --> 01:17:58,421
Sorry. Not again.

1269
01:18:05,028 --> 01:18:06,362
Brian! Get out!

1270
01:18:16,973 --> 01:18:19,008
[echoing] Brian!

1271
01:18:20,143 --> 01:18:22,143
[beeps]

1272
01:18:22,145 --> 01:18:23,378
[no audible dialogue]

1273
01:18:23,380 --> 01:18:29,320
[choir vocalizing]

1274
01:18:43,267 --> 01:18:45,334
[man] Present arms!

1275
01:18:45,336 --> 01:18:48,072
[bagpipes blowing]

1276
01:19:19,303 --> 01:19:22,006
[bagpipes continue]

1277
01:19:30,615 --> 01:19:32,250
[sobbing]

1278
01:20:04,482 --> 01:20:07,083
You were right.

1279
01:20:07,085 --> 01:20:09,187
The numbers correspond
to cell towers.

1280
01:20:10,255 --> 01:20:11,487
We monitored the frequency.

1281
01:20:11,489 --> 01:20:13,556
The last few hits
have been near Calumet.

1282
01:20:13,558 --> 01:20:17,661
It must be far from the tower because
the search circle is way too large.

1283
01:20:17,663 --> 01:20:20,631
Takes in half the storage areas
south of the city.

1284
01:20:20,633 --> 01:20:23,534
Nobody's got the manpower to
search that many storage yards.

1285
01:20:23,536 --> 01:20:28,539
And with the ATF on the fire and Kunz's
"undetermined" call, we got no writ.

1286
01:20:28,541 --> 01:20:31,107
It's up to the feds now.

1287
01:20:31,109 --> 01:20:33,577
Look, to hell with
downtown and the feds.

1288
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:35,046
Orders or not...

1289
01:20:36,449 --> 01:20:39,050
whatever you want,
whatever you need...

1290
01:20:40,319 --> 01:20:42,388
We're here to help you
finish this, Sean.

1291
01:20:44,557 --> 01:20:46,592
There's something
I gotta do first.

1292
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:03,273
[door buzzes, clicks]

1293
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:05,209
Thanks.

1294
01:21:05,211 --> 01:21:07,344
Wow.
[laughing]

1295
01:21:07,346 --> 01:21:09,382
A cat fall on your head?

1296
01:21:11,951 --> 01:21:14,218
- Did you bring the sugar?
- No, I didn't bring you sugar.

1297
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:16,153
I just came here
for one thing.

1298
01:21:16,155 --> 01:21:18,190
You're so mean.

1299
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:23,495
I'm sorry about
your Uncle Brian.

1300
01:21:23,497 --> 01:21:26,698
- I read what they wrote about him in OFI.
- Yeah.

1301
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:28,365
He seemed like
he was very nice.

1302
01:21:28,367 --> 01:21:30,404
I just met him once.

1303
01:21:31,505 --> 01:21:34,171
So, what's your one thing?

1304
01:21:34,173 --> 01:21:36,608
The two arson pros
that came to see you,

1305
01:21:36,610 --> 01:21:38,276
who were they workin' for?

1306
01:21:38,278 --> 01:21:40,245
Which foreign
intelligence agency

1307
01:21:40,247 --> 01:21:42,247
were they gonna sell
that package to?

1308
01:21:42,249 --> 01:21:44,549
Russians? Chinese?

1309
01:21:44,551 --> 01:21:46,317
Really?

1310
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:48,453
Wow.

1311
01:21:48,455 --> 01:21:50,488
They didn't say anything
about that to me.

1312
01:21:50,490 --> 01:21:52,524
Okay, well,
what did they want?

1313
01:21:52,526 --> 01:21:54,292
What did...

1314
01:21:54,294 --> 01:21:58,263
They just wanted what
all would-be dragon tamers want.

1315
01:21:58,265 --> 01:22:01,433
They wanted an opportunity
to sit with the man they know

1316
01:22:01,435 --> 01:22:04,137
knows how to converse
with the dragon.

1317
01:22:05,672 --> 01:22:08,206
Hang on. Did you help them
with the Lincoln Park fire?

1318
01:22:08,208 --> 01:22:11,409
Sean, no! No!

1319
01:22:11,411 --> 01:22:13,511
I-I have a reputation.

1320
01:22:13,513 --> 01:22:16,548
I just talked to them
about the dragon.

1321
01:22:16,550 --> 01:22:22,287
Okay, so how were they gonna ship
their package out of the country?

1322
01:22:22,289 --> 01:22:24,523
Package?

1323
01:22:24,525 --> 01:22:26,792
Why-Why would they
talk to me about that?

1324
01:22:26,794 --> 01:22:30,195
Because the language of
these people is fire, right?

1325
01:22:30,197 --> 01:22:33,734
Oh. They don't speak
the language of fire.

1326
01:22:35,035 --> 01:22:36,569
Not like we do.

1327
01:22:36,571 --> 01:22:38,471
Yeah, you and I don't speak
the same language.

1328
01:22:38,473 --> 01:22:42,575
Oh, come on, Sean.
Of course we do.

1329
01:22:42,577 --> 01:22:45,578
You love to speak with the dragon.
So do I.

1330
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:49,350
And the dragon loves to speak with
us, and you know it.

1331
01:22:50,418 --> 01:22:53,488
And poor Rimgale.
That's all he ever wanted.

1332
01:22:54,522 --> 01:22:57,356
But the dragon
wouldn't dance for him.

1333
01:22:57,358 --> 01:22:59,325
It's true.

1334
01:22:59,327 --> 01:23:01,694
Just you and me, Sean.

1335
01:23:01,696 --> 01:23:06,467
When your Uncle Brian and
Rimgale came to see me in here...

1336
01:23:07,468 --> 01:23:10,271
they came to interview
the... the devil.

1337
01:23:12,507 --> 01:23:17,343
You knew that if you were ever
going to come in here to see me,

1338
01:23:17,345 --> 01:23:21,280
you knew it was your alter ego
that you'd be seeing.

1339
01:23:21,282 --> 01:23:25,353
You would be seeing...
another you.

1340
01:23:26,688 --> 01:23:29,458
Hi, another me.

1341
01:23:30,391 --> 01:23:32,391
All right, look,
just level with me.

1342
01:23:32,393 --> 01:23:34,394
How are they gettin'
the package out of Chicago?

1343
01:23:34,396 --> 01:23:38,600
I don't know anything about a package.
Nothing. Okay?

1344
01:23:40,402 --> 01:23:42,702
But I will share
a story with you,

1345
01:23:42,704 --> 01:23:44,538
if you will share
a story with me.

1346
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:46,773
Goddamn it.
Listen to me, you son of a bitch.

1347
01:23:46,775 --> 01:23:48,642
This isn't a conversation,
okay?

1348
01:23:48,644 --> 01:23:51,444
[chuckling]

1349
01:23:51,446 --> 01:23:53,547
[blowing]

1350
01:23:53,549 --> 01:23:56,251
All right.
What story?

1351
01:23:57,452 --> 01:24:01,755
Two guys walk into a building,
one walks out.

1352
01:24:01,757 --> 01:24:03,323
You know what?
Fuck you.

1353
01:24:03,325 --> 01:24:05,659
I told you at the hospital

1354
01:24:05,661 --> 01:24:09,563
that I still had
one more question to ask.

1355
01:24:09,565 --> 01:24:12,399
The answer that you give

1356
01:24:12,401 --> 01:24:15,504
could be very cleansing
for you, Sean.

1357
01:24:18,675 --> 01:24:22,309
He'd already lit his burn in the
church on West Haddon Street.

1358
01:24:22,311 --> 01:24:26,381
Yeah. I imagine it must have
been very beautiful.

1359
01:24:28,350 --> 01:24:30,085
It was over-thought.

1360
01:24:31,754 --> 01:24:35,388
Lot of show,
but you could tell by its yammering

1361
01:24:35,390 --> 01:24:39,560
that it was unstable enough to knock
out with the right counter fire.

1362
01:24:39,562 --> 01:24:43,333
So, I grabbed a gardener's
can of mixed fuel...

1363
01:24:44,434 --> 01:24:46,667
and I splashed
a response.

1364
01:24:46,669 --> 01:24:48,569
Just a little.

1365
01:24:48,571 --> 01:24:51,706
But enough that both fires
turned on each other,

1366
01:24:51,708 --> 01:24:54,842
away from the building,
and ate each other's tails.

1367
01:24:54,844 --> 01:24:56,713
Poof. Done.

1368
01:24:58,715 --> 01:25:01,851

was still consumed.

1370
01:25:06,789 --> 01:25:08,591
So here's my question.

1371
01:25:09,726 --> 01:25:11,694
What did you feel...

1372
01:25:12,729 --> 01:25:14,597
when Wicek caught fire?

1373
01:25:16,199 --> 01:25:17,901
Did you want him to burn?

1374
01:25:19,535 --> 01:25:21,805

1375
01:25:25,643 --> 01:25:28,476

1376
01:25:28,478 --> 01:25:30,748

Those two men
with the pretend names,

1380
01:25:45,496 --> 01:25:49,767
they wanted my opinion
of their notion...

1381
01:25:51,435 --> 01:25:55,671
as to how they could best
trigger an "accidental" fire

1382
01:25:55,673 --> 01:25:57,906
at an exterior location.

1383
01:25:57,908 --> 01:25:59,843
Okay. What location?

1384
01:26:03,014 --> 01:26:06,917
Given the Kelvin required
for ignition was minimal,

1385
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:12,189
given the constraint
of mixed fuel,

1386
01:26:13,024 --> 01:26:15,860
given the narrow diameter
piping,

1387
01:26:17,261 --> 01:26:18,930
given all of that...

1388
01:26:20,698 --> 01:26:24,401
I would suggest that you
go looking for a location...

1389
01:26:25,436 --> 01:26:27,970
