1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,544
This film is brought to you by

2
00:00:02,627 --> 00:00:06,089
the Los Angeles Cinefest film festival

3
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:09,426

and the oh scares awards

5
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:55,221
I see you are ready. Already.

6
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:58,058
Hahaha...

7
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:06,224
Let's begin, then. Enjoy.
Masked ghost lady.

8
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:11,029
Do you like scary movies, Sydney?

9
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,281
Hmmm. Hello everyone.

10
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,826
You probably know my brother
in law from the big screen.

11
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:23,833
Yes, he wanted to be here with us. But
unfortunately, he can't. He is in Sydney.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,086
Yes, you heard right.

13
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:30,173
He is in Sydney.
Sydney, Australia, that is.

14
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,382
He is promoting.

15
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:37,847
His new book called do you want to
dye your hair to a blonde color Sydney?

16
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,350
Any how, I'm here instead.

17
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:43,186
I present to you scary stories

18
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:47,161
previously selected by
the Los Angeles Cinefest

19
00:01:47,244 --> 00:01:50,485
film festival and the oh scares awards.

20
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:55,657
I can't see shit through this latex
mask. Can somebody read it please?

21
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:58,451
Hightail.

22
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,454
Hair of the dog.

23
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,208
Dead end drive.

24
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,168
Searching.

25
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,629
His shadow.

26
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:15,301
Now, you can watch and decide
which story you like the most.

27
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:20,849
Oh, maybe it was: Do you want to
dye your hair to a red color, Sydney?

28
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:26,104
Anyway, enjoy your screening everyone.

29
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:36,841
Why don't we tag along with your
friend Carol like we did last year?

30
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,299
Because I'm tired of hearing about how her

31
00:03:39,382 --> 00:03:42,305
husband cheated on her
again for the fourth time

32
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:46,142
and yet she refuses to leave him
because their eternal bond is too strong.

33
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,894
Too strong.

34
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,320
Hi, Carol.

35
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,198
Hey, handsome.

36
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,830
Okay, time to go.

37
00:04:56,045 --> 00:05:00,883
God, this place gives me the creeps.
I've never seen anyone come or go from it.

38
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,260
Same.

39
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:11,978
Whoa. No, sir.

40
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,648
You're not going to step
an inch toward that place.

41
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,944
Just let him go. We're right here.

42
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,279
Are you crazy?

43
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,115
What if some psychopedophile lives there?

44
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,825
Seriously?

45
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,746
What if they're just not
that in the Halloween? Like,

46
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:33,750
relax.

47
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:35,710
Let be fine.

48
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,961
Okay?

49
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,296
Okay.

50
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,555
Look.

51
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,141
I don't I don't know why you worry so much.

52
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:53,102
I mean it's it's not like
he's out here by himself.

53
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,438
I'm sorry for wanting
to keep our kids safe.

54
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,154
Honey, they may not be home.

55
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,585
That's strange.

56
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,089
Oh my god.

57
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,173
Leo.

58
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:30,181
God, I told you it wasn't
safe. Why did I listen to you?

59
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,475
Can you break it down?

60
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,852
I'm going to try. Just call the police.

61
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,229
Find him.

62
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,115
911. What's your emergency?

63
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:51,786
What the hell?

64
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,234
Leo.

65
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,092
Leo.

66
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,282
Wes?

67
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,492
Oh.

68
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,539
Where the hell are you?

69
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:31,130
Where is my son?

70
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,173
Leo?

71
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,717
Wes, ah.

72
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:17,653
I should have been a pair of ragged claws
scuttling across the floors of silent seas.

73
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,458
Ethan.

74
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,253
Ethan.

75
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:40,677
Ethan. Rise and shine tigers.

76
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,515
This is your wake up call.

77
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,143
It's 6 am but right now,

78
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:52,688
let's focus on your nine o'clock.

79
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,482
Take a peek.

80
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:16,420
Ethan.

81
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,312
Another bad dream babes?

82
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,486
Your chest hair has started to turn gray.

83
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,530
I like it.

84
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,036
It reminds me of my dad.

85
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,502
Do I ever remind you of your daughter?

86
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,797
Hahaha...

87
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,468
What the hell is wrong with you? Hahaha...

88
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,307
Not a damn thing.

89
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:47,363
I have seen the moment
of my greatness flicker

90
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:52,451
and I have seen the eternal
footman hold my coat and snickered.

91
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,328
And in short,

92
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:59,208
I was afraid.

93
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:14,056
Been having lucid
dreams? Like really lucid?

94
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,849
Can't seem to stay
asleep or stay awake. It's

95
00:16:18,932 --> 00:16:22,398
getting really hard
to tell which is which.

96
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,880
Any muscle aches,

97
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,175
stiffness in the joints,
that sort of thing.

98
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,513
Lost of flexibility, range of motion.

99
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,473
No.

100
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,561
Any problems at all aside from insomnia.

101
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,231
What's wrong with me?

102
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,317
Nothing.

103
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,030
The trouble is there is no trouble.

104
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,200
I'm looking at the results of your
physical and you're in perfect health.

105
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,494
So that's good, right?

106
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:23,208
These are the test results from
a year ago before the accident.

107
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:28,797
High blood pressure, bit of
weight gain, mild heart arrhythmia.

108
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:34,470
Today, average blood pressure.

109
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,473
Tell him we've been jogging.

110
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,060
Yeah, we've, I've been jogging.

111
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:44,188
Jogging won't fix an arrhythmia.

112
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,691
And then there are
the results of the x rays.

113
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,278
In the accident, you broke
two bones in your left arm.

114
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,656
You had a compound
fracture, the tibia of the left leg.

115
00:17:56,241 --> 00:18:00,120
There are no signs those
bones have been broken now.

116
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,627
I've been your doctor for
10 years, mister Russell.

117
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,337
Russoff

118
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:12,134
and you're not just in
good shape and you're

119
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,927
in better shape than you've ever been.

120
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,472
After all the injuries you had,

121
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,868
those joints should be
screaming bloody murder every

122
00:18:21,951 --> 00:18:24,895
time it rains and you're
feeling no pain at all.

123
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,149
What might account for something like that?

124
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:34,196
Hell if I know if I did I'd
be bottling it and selling it.

125
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,164
I wonder if we might try
something.

126
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,129
Gonna get you to close your eyes.

127
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,177
Now just focus on the sound of my voice.

128
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,180
Focus.

129
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,059
Focus,

130
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,354
focus,

131
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,649
focus.

132
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,236
And open.

133
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,915
Not exactly sure how this works.

134
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,754
Not even sure I'm in the right place. I've

135
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:16,173
never really been a
fan of organized religion.

136
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,635
And you're definitely in the right place.

137
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:24,640
Christianity is one of the most
disorganized religions in the world.

138
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,308
You're unchurched?

139
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,602
Uh, over churched.

140
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,774
I think I used to believe in god
and the church talked me out of it.

141
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,859
Understandable.

142
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,862
You know, when Jesus was a boy,

143
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,492
his own parents lost him at a church.

144
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,954
Found him there too though.

145
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:55,796
This is completely confidential
rhymes like talking to a lawyer?

146
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,423
Like talking to a lawyer?

147
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:03,387
I mean, the only time I'd
hypothetically have to break silence is

148
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,100
if you had plans for
something suicidal or homicidal.

149
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,644
Can we live with those terms?

150
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,232
What about his terms?

151
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:16,649
Whose?

152
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,485
The judge?

153
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:20,945
Nah,

154
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,782
I think it's going to
be alright with him too.

155
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,746
So, you're here because

156
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,834
you've done something you're sorry for?

157
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:36,962
Yes.

158
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,217
Then all you have to do is confess it.

159
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,804
What if I know I'm going to do it again?

160
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:50,392
Some might say that exceeds
the boundaries of being sorry.

161
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:54,396
No, I I don't want to do it again. I just,

162
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,275
I know that I will. Uh...

163
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:06,992
And maybe I've exceeded the
boundaries of being forgivable.

164
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,165
Nah, you're not going to shock me, son.

165
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,584
We're all mad here.

166
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:21,089
This year's birthday.

167
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,883
It was a big four O.

168
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,973
So my friends and me we we
decided we make a weekend of it.

169
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:38,273
There's this cave system
just over in bray county.

170
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,527
Unexplored stuff.

171
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:40,455
The time of my resurrection.
I've been dead for almost 2 hours.

172
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,290
How's that possible? It's not.

173
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:47,546
Yeah, the brain can't be deprived
of oxygen that long and at best,

174
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:53,426
I should be in some
kind of vegetative state.

175
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,471
You don't seem very vegetative.

176
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:57,806
No.

177
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:00,182
No.

178
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,771
In fact, I'm sharper than ever.

179
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,527
Unless I'm still in that hole.

180
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:16,992
Let's pretend I'm real
and not part of your head.

181
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,036
Okay.

182
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:25,292
You're here because you feel like
this accident changed you somehow?

183
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,380
Not change me. No.

184
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,344
I feel like when I woke up,

185
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,181
something else woke up with me again.

186
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,436
Like it woke up in me.

187
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,820
Ethan?

188
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,455
Gotta have a family.

189
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:16,884
Ethan?

190
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,804
Don't tech me.

191
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:24,309
I have a wife and I have a little
girl and they're scared of me.

192
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,396
I'm scared too.

193
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,902
It's like I'm standing
just sobbing.

194
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:39,366
Burned out a wreckage
of my own life, you know

195
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,361
And I realize I'm not
crying because of everything

196
00:27:45,444 --> 00:27:48,124
I've lost. I'm crying because
I missed the damn fire.

197
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:58,009
You tell me there's something in
your disorganized religion about that.

198
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:04,094
The apostle Paul says
we all have two natures the

199
00:28:04,177 --> 00:28:08,136
carnal and the spiritual
the old man and the new

200
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:16,903
both always hungry and we're
always feeding one or the other.

201
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,868
So how does one get rid of the old man?

202
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,248
Mortification.

203
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,419
There's no reasoning with it.

204
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,255
It has to be put to death, crucified.

205
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:39,551
There's no quick fix, I'm afraid.

206
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,388
No silver bullets.

207
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,483
Do I dare disturb the universe?

208
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:43,490
In a minute, there is time
for decisions and revisions.

209
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,159
My name is Ethan.

210
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:50,955
Which minute I will rehearse.

211
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:53,832
And…

212
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:29,576
I am…

213
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,757
I am aware.

214
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,536
Hey, sorry I hesitated back there.

215
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,038
No worries.

216
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,790
I've probably done the same.

217
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:58,999
Mhm.

218
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,002
Yeah. Ok.

219
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,463
Would you like a cold one?

220
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,506
Cold one? Mhm.

221
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,424
Yeah.

222
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,385
Yeah. I yeah.

223
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,637
Cold one. Be good.

224
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,263
Great.

225
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,688
Hey, how'd you do that whole gate thing?

226
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,774
Those solar panels.

227
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,444
The gate and pretty much
everything around here.

228
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:30,490
Jacob and I are what
you might call preppers.

229
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:37,288
So, when the shit hit the fan, you
could say we was already ready already.

230
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,045
Hmm.

231
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,090
Hmm.

232
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:50,592
Hmm.

233
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,178
Oh man.

234
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,514
That was good.

235
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,022
What about outside?

236
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,899
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.

237
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:09,237
Between the gate and the few
other tricks we got set up for 'em.

238
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,364
It would take a whole ocean of 'em.

239
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:12,758
Well, from what I just saw that.

240
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:16,995
Looks like we got ourselves a
house guest. How goes it, buddy?

241
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:21,416
Good. Good. Thanks.

242
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:28,089
Hey, baby. Hey.

243
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:29,966
Who we got here?

244
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:33,094
Well, we ain't get that
far yet, sugar booger.

245
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,972
What you say your name is, sweetie?

246
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:39,392
I didn't. Um sorry.

247
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,311
My name's Oscar. Um Jacob right?

248
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,481
Don't stand up on my account Oscar.

249
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,611
Sorry I didn't mean to.

250
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,613
Oh don't mind him.

251
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,658
He just hadn't had any
entertainment since all this started.

252
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:58,453
I'm Darcy.

253
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,997
Oh hi Darcy. I.. I'm sorry I didn't.

254
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,291
No more sorry Oscar mayor.

255
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,334
Alright the world's sorry enough.

256
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:08,546
We gotta focus on the
brighter side of things.

257
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,465
What's for dinner darling?

258
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:14,594
Oh well I do have them
leftovers from last night.

259
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,679
God damn honey leftovers?

260
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:19,307
Oh. Well we gotta guest.
He doesn't want any leftovers.

261
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:22,018
You don't want and damn leftovers right?

262
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,269
Oh no.

263
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:27,523
I mean I no don't worry about me.
I don't I don't need any leftovers.

264
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:32,111
I mean I would love
leftovers but I don't need them.

265
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,614
I... I don't I don't need anything really.

266
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:39,911
I just just need a place to stay
for the night until sunrise maybe.

267
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,008
Uh, is that okay?

268
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,622
No. Oh hell no.

269
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,165
No?

270
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,002
No you ain't not staying for dinner.

271
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:53,174
Look. My woman makes some of
the best cooking from here to Kansas.

272
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,661
Oh hey, yeah. So strap in fellow.

273
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:55,884
Really?

274
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,513
I trust I don't need anything.
I already imposed that.

275
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,598
Nope. Nope. Too late. Done deal. Mhm.

276
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,016
You're here for dinner.

277
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,185
Okay.

278
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,937
Okay. Thank you.

279
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:06,787
Thank you.

280
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,564
And don't forget dessert.

281
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:10,900
Hot apple pie.

282
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,568
Hot apple pie.

283
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,028
Yes sir.

284
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,656
Holy shit Oscar Wilde.

285
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,158
You are something special.

286
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,548
Oscar, you better finish
up all them vegetables.

287
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,884
They are fresh from the garden
and they are real real good for you.

288
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,219
Don't worry, ma'am.

289
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,597
Be sure to clean my plate
and clean up after myself.

290
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:45,476
I know it's the apocalypse and
all but still haven't lost my manner.

291
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,897
Well that is so kind to you and
we certainly do appreciate it.

292
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:55,111
After you help clean up them dishes,
you should probably wash yourself.

293
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,405
There's hot water right at the tub.

294
00:35:58,656 --> 00:35:59,740
Really?

295
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,827
No, I can't waste your water like that.

296
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,315
Oh no, don't you worry about it.

297
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,733
Get put right out to the garden.

298
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,582
Besides, you need it.

299
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:11,043
You are on the right side
of a three-day dead skunk.

300
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,628
Shit.

301
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:13,879
Sorry.

302
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:16,174
Just been so long since I've been around.

303
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,182
Don't worry. People.

304
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:19,177
Ain't no thing, Oscar Mcgrouch.

305
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,532
We all been through the trash before.

306
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,388
Mm hmm.

307
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:27,977
I try not to smell like us. I
think it keeps them from noticing.

308
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,231
Well, we will get you
smelling like a Daisy in no time.

309
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,026
Yeah and don't you worry
about them outsiders, alright?

310
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,953
Once the critters start
running around in the

311
00:36:37,018 --> 00:36:39,197
morning, they'll be chasing
after them like coon dogs.

312
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,867
You'll you'll have a straight shot
through the woods to the lake.

313
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:44,410
Lake?

314
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,579
Yeah, it's a big lake.

315
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:49,415
So big, they can't follow.

316
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,292
And on the other side,

317
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:56,964
there's a hidden mining trail that
leads you all the way to salvation.

318
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,425
I I thought this was salvation.

319
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,221
Oh, hell no, buddy.

320
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,139
This is just the first stop.

321
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:08,059
But if you know it's there,
why you're still here?

322
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,397
Some things just ain't that easy.

323
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:16,776
Right.

324
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,152
The chair.

325
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,029
Sorry.

326
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,236
You know, we got other
reasons but that's one of em.

327
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,742
Plus, I'd rather die in my own home.

328
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,118
Okay. Then out there.

329
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:30,164
I think it's time for me to finish cleaning
up here. Sugar, what about dessert?

330
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,918
We can get to that after, baby.

331
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:39,090
Alright, I'll leave you all to
it. I gotta take a piss anyhow.

332
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,135
You take good care of my girl, Oscar.

333
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:47,139
Oh yeah yes sir. You got it.

334
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,894
Can't wait to taste that sweet pie baby.

335
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:56,274
I will come find you
when it's ready. Mm hmm.

336
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:57,482
Looking forward to it.

337
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:05,032
So nice having a little helper again.

338
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,579
How long has he been.

339
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,873
Oh, longer than I known him.

340
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,043
He fell out of a truck when he was a boy.

341
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,337
Been in a chair most of his life.

342
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:23,009
Well, take great care of him.

343
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,970
We take great care of each other.

344
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,973
I get that.

345
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:33,477
I just was surprised to
see someone so crippled.

346
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,979
Grateful

347
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:36,856
alive.

348
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,191
No, not at all.

349
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:45,364
I was going to say challenged,
surviving, through all this.

350
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,080
Look Darcey,

351
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,334
I gotta be straight with you.

352
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:02,882
Remember before when you said it would
take a whole ocean of them to get in here?

353
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,801
Yeah because we got all these Tsunami.

354
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,348
I'm a day ahead about a
thousand of these fuckers

355
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:13,934
I'm going to tear through here
tomorrow and we need to be gone.

356
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,645
I'm sure we've been through worse.

357
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,230
Not like this.

358
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:25,654
There's over 100 us living in brick
buildings behind a giant iron fence.

359
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,699
They tore that place down like locusts.

360
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,993
I'm the only one left.

361
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:34,747
No, we need to go at first light.

362
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:39,960
Jacob already told you there ain't no
way the two of us can get him there.

363
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,171
I know.

364
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,591
And he's right.

365
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,178
We can.

366
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:55,850
Ok.

367
00:39:56,227 --> 00:40:00,231
So you want me to run off with you
and leave my husband here to die?

368
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,190
No, no, no.

369
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,399
Or you want to kill him?

370
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,525
No, it's done. No.

371
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,444
It's not what I meant, dad.

372
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,822
Look, we'll barricade him in.

373
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:12,743
We'll go to the salvation and we'll bring
back enough help to get him there safely.

374
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,329
It will take at least a week to do that.

375
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,116
And if he survived, he'd
be covered in bedsores

376
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:20,418
and I ain't willing to
put him through that.

377
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,337
So you can leave by
yourself in the morning.

378
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:28,050
We got plenty of supplies downstairs.
You can take whatever you can carry.

379
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,677
I get it.

380
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,345
I really do.

381
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,682
The love you have is amazing

382
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,226
and... and you don't
want to live without him. I...

383
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:42,398
I don't want to take that
away from you but it's not fair.

384
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,152
You deserve to live, Darcy.

385
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:50,281
There's a shit ton of evil out there

386
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:54,493
and we need all the good people
we can get and you good people.

387
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,163
You both are.

388
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,425
Well.

389
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:17,600
We prepared for everything including today.

390
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:23,314
We may be simple
people but we ain't stupid.

391
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:27,943
Jacob's been on that cb every day.
We knew something was coming.

392
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,738
He just didn't expect you.

393
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:36,160
I'm not trying to take
you from your husband.

394
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,330
I just don't want you to die.

395
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,209
I ain't going to die, Oscar.

396
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,921
Cuz, I'm coming with you.

397
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,215
Really?

398
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,467
You will.

399
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,137
What about Jacob?

400
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:01,322
I'm going to take him a
piece of that pie and I'm

401
00:42:01,405 --> 00:42:04,897
going to tuck him in
the bed and I'll tell him.

402
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:10,819
We didn't even expect to survive
this long out here on our own.

403
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:14,573
Jacob's been waiting for
someone like you to come along.

404
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:18,077
Someone who could
get me safely to salvation.

405
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,954
Yes, absolutely.

406
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:24,500
I'll get you there but that doesn't
mean we need to give up on Jacob.

407
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,378
He ain't going to change his mind.

408
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:32,091
So why don't you go and get cleaned up and

409
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:36,720
I'll go prepare Jacob then
we can go get supplies

410
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,558
and he ain't going to say goodbye.

411
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,477
Yeah, I know. I...

412
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,104
I get that.

413
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:50,192
I understand. Yeah, just down the hall.

414
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,653
Second door on the right.

415
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,322
Okay, great.

416
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,244
I'm sorry.

417
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,831
Don't be Oscar.

418
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,458
You're saving us.

419
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,128
Ok.

420
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,348
Sorry about Jacob.

421
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:25,311
He knows you're a real
good fellow and all. He just...

422
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:28,022
He ain't good at goodbyes.

423
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,690
No worries.

424
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,085
Just hope he doesn't think
I'm trying to steal his girl.

425
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,612
No, he don't think that at all.

426
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,448
He knows you are just trying to help me.

427
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:42,786
Yeah, I just want to you know
still be a good human you know.

428
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:46,332
Do whatever it takes to
get this world back on track.

429
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,540
Yeah.

430
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,836
So what types of supplies
you folks have down here?

431
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,921
Anything you recommend I grab first?

432
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,298
What do you suggest?

433
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,884
Darcy?

434
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,177
Darcy?

435
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:03,891
No. Darcy.

436
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:22,451
Hmm.

437
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,417
Well, she sounded hungry.

438
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:36,632
I'm just glad our little girl is
finally getting some vegetables.

439
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,262
Wait, what about all that beer?

440
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:47,601
Well, we'll just do better next time.

441
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:32,790
Tinny.

442
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:35,459
Kelly?

443
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:11,138
Kelly?

444
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,057
Are you here?

445
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:29,990
Kelly, is that you?

446
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,747
How is this possible?

447
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:50,052
Hey, beauty. Do you want to have some fun?

448
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,639
Where are you going?

449
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:05,544
Hello.

450
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:06,837
Tinny?

451
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,589
Please pass the phone to mama.

452
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,260
Hello?

453
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,691
I'm so sorry.

454
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,282
I didn't know.

455
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,076
I'm so sorry.

456
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,554
Please.

457
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:01,266
I love you no matter what.

458
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,450
How have you been, Mateo?

459
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:08,161
Gomez.

460
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:13,750
So, this is where you went.

461
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:16,836
Yeah.

462
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:20,882
I just left some food
and. What do you want?

463
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:25,804
I apologize for causing you any stress.

464
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:28,014
I only ever mean to help.

465
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:34,145
It's a tragedy that happened around
here and I just wanted to pay my respects.

466
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:36,189
Please leave.

467
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:39,901
It's a shame what happened to him but now.

468
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:41,820
We have your…

469
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:50,995
Hey,

470
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:52,831
Mateo?

471
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:58,419
Mateo.

472
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:01,798
Are you okay?

473
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:06,469
I... I.. I thought I saw something.

474
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:11,308
When's the last time you got some sleep?

475
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,059
Or even showered?

476
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,729
Uh a couple days ago, I think.

477
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:20,525
I came out from out east and I
drove straight through a couple nights.

478
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:25,196
I will get out of your hair and let
you get some well-needed rest.

479
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:28,908
I'll see you soon, okay?

480
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:35,255
Oh, god.

481
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:04,168
God damn it!

482
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:11,384
- What are you doing?
- You, idiot.

483
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:15,448
I am not crazy.

484
01:07:45,936 --> 01:07:47,313
I'm crazy.

485
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:06,390
Hey.

486
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:07,582
What?

487
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:18,803
You making a bonfire or new house.

488
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:24,058
I couldn't decide between the
two. So, I just kept chopping.

489
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:26,310
Shit.

490
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:34,276
Look like you could use a break, son.

491
01:08:37,154 --> 01:08:39,782
You look like you need
some gardening tools.

492
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:43,160
Some good soil you got there.

493
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:45,579
Ever feel like planting
anything around here?

494
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:46,956
What?

495
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:48,582
Something like that?

496
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,041
This is a root plant.

497
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:54,880
I wanted to get you a nice housewarming
gift and show you how to plant it.

498
01:08:57,341 --> 01:09:00,845
I grew up on a farm. I think
I can handle a little flower.

499
01:09:03,597 --> 01:09:05,933
You should put those
hands in some ice water.

500
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:08,978
Looks like you have some
blisters in your tending.

501
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:12,356
Too much chopping.

502
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:16,110
These stains aren't ever going to come off.

503
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:19,113
Scratching and rubbing only make it worse.

504
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,365
You have to accept the pain.

505
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:23,576
That's the first step in healing.

506
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:29,206
Thanks for the flower.

507
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:32,042
I'll make sure to plant
it as soon as I can.

508
01:09:33,752 --> 01:09:35,129
Anytime son.

509
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:42,052
By the way,

510
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:45,764
thanks for the sandwich.

511
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:51,520
I thought you might be hungry after
traveling such a long and unforgiving path.

512
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:57,109
And it was delicious.

513
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,946
Not a big fruit guy though.

514
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,199
Fruit?

515
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:07,494
The apple.

516
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:10,331
Ah, the apple.

517
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,208
Of course.

518
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:16,316
I could come by later with
some more sandwiches

519
01:10:16,399 --> 01:10:18,589
and we could have some
tea if you're interested.

520
01:10:18,797 --> 01:10:20,277
Listen, I'm just a bit on edge today.

521
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:22,092
I... I left some chamomile in there.

522
01:10:22,259 --> 01:10:23,969
It does wonders for anxiety.

523
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:25,679
What do you say?

524
01:10:29,266 --> 01:10:30,476
I guess so.

525
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:32,602
Alright then.

526
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:35,273
I'll come by sometime this
afternoon.

527
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:18,208
No. No.

528
01:13:06,965 --> 01:13:08,467
I'm sorry I'm late.

529
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:11,387
Duty called.

530
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:14,181
I just boiled the water.

531
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:15,974
Again.

532
01:13:23,774 --> 01:13:28,612
You were looking a little skinny so I
stuffed yours with extra ham and cheese.

533
01:13:29,613 --> 01:13:31,865
Don't worry about me, Gomez.

534
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,463
You two are so happy back then.

535
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:54,929
I am sorry.

536
01:13:55,055 --> 01:13:56,890
Please, put that down.

537
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,311
I meant no offense.

538
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:05,691
I'll go get the tape.

539
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:45,522
How are your hands doing?

540
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:49,943
They're fine.

541
01:14:51,403 --> 01:14:53,739
I could take a look at
them if you don't mind.

542
01:14:55,407 --> 01:14:57,784
So you're a priest and a doctor.

543
01:14:58,368 --> 01:15:00,579
What are you a shrink too?

544
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:06,502
Why were you in this
house when I first arrived?

545
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,839
I wanted to give you a warm
welcome when you arrived.

546
01:15:11,048 --> 01:15:13,383
You said there was a
murder around these parts.

547
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:20,015
You knew the victim. And
you know the murderer.

548
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:21,892
I did.

549
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,063
And I do.

550
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:28,732
Who was he?

551
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:31,527
Someone I held dear.

552
01:15:31,818 --> 01:15:34,071
Tell me who he was.

553
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:35,781
Say his name.

554
01:15:35,989 --> 01:15:37,407
He was my son.

555
01:15:48,168 --> 01:15:50,170
That's why I took the cross.

556
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,174
To save your son's soul.

557
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:57,052
He's out of my hands now.

558
01:15:58,095 --> 01:16:02,599
I took the cross because I needed to
forgive the man who took him from me.

559
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:07,729
Does that man even deserve forgiveness?

560
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:09,856
That's up to him.

561
01:16:12,442 --> 01:16:15,737
He has to decide whether
he can forgive himself.

562
01:16:16,446 --> 01:16:18,407
He's tearing himself apart right now.

563
01:16:18,615 --> 01:16:20,909
His own mind is at war with it.

564
01:16:21,326 --> 01:16:23,673
He keeps climbing and cutting and bleeding

565
01:16:23,756 --> 01:16:26,415
himself only to stuff
it back into darkness.

566
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:29,835
Not allowing himself
to be helped or healed.

567
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:34,298
Not allowing himself to
face and accept his shadow.

568
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:44,099
He has to decide whether
he stays here or moves on.

569
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:54,109
It's what he would have wanted.

570
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:56,820
Put that down.

571
01:17:04,328 --> 01:17:05,912
Get out.

572
01:17:08,206 --> 01:17:09,416
Get out.

573
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:12,497
I tried to hide it.

574
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:17,294
I am so sorry.

575
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:21,173
I forgive you.

576
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:24,634
Why?

577
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:31,975
You've been running and
hiding from it for too long.

578
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:22,168
Mateo?

579
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:33,471
I am so sorry for what I've done. I
know it hasn't been easy for you either.

580
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:35,223
I just…

581
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:41,021
I thought you'd be angry with me.

582
01:21:41,479 --> 01:21:48,278
The man I was still is but the
man I am now will never let you go.

583
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:08,715
I am ready.

584
01:22:54,844 --> 01:22:57,097
Uh hey, guys. Do you need me or?

585
01:22:57,263 --> 01:22:59,432
Nope. That's it for today.

586
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:00,641
Oh,

587
01:23:00,767 --> 01:23:03,172
I thought you wanted
me to say something at

588
01:23:03,255 --> 01:23:05,855
the end of the compilation
or between shorts.

589
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:07,190
I prepared some lines.

590
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:10,151
Nope, that's it. It's a wrap.

591
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:16,574
Finally, I was dying in that mask.

592
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:18,785
Okay, see you next time.

593
01:24:10,336 --> 01:24:11,672
I'm a ware...
Wrrrrr
